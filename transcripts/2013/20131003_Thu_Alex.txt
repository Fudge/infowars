[00:00:03.291 --> 00:00:08.134]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:15.819]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.520]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:19.502]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:20.843]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.583 --> 00:00:22.544]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.124 --> 00:00:26.766]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.307 --> 00:00:31.390]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.500 --> 00:01:03.274]  Well, the doctor-in-chief, Barack Obama, our gracious leader from which all good things flow, says he's still not going to compromise on anything like taxes on heart devices or taxes on the payroll of people making less than $30,000 a year.
[00:01:05.512 --> 00:01:09.194]  He's not going to compromise on anything with House Republicans.
[00:01:10.074 --> 00:01:26.601]  And the media, the kleptocrat media, the establishment media, plays along with it, saying that it is the Republicans that have shut down the government, even though they've given, what, four different versions since last week to the Senate that they have voted down promptly.
[00:01:26.741 --> 00:01:30.163]  So they are here trying to teach you that you need them.
[00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:38.014]  As we speak, by the way, we're going to be covering the latest on the shutdown and more of the memorial shutdown.
[00:01:38.274 --> 00:01:45.820]  Even in France, they've shut down just open-air cemeteries on the coastline from the Normandy D-Day invasion.
[00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:52.806]  But they had plenty of guards there to make sure that none of the veterans that had traveled there or others could get in.
[00:01:53.126 --> 00:01:56.028]  But don't worry, all the elite officer golf courses
[00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:01.450]  They're all staying open and all the red carpets and all the caviar.
[00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:13.092]  In fact, now they've gone to Mount Vernon and a bunch of other places that are not even federal parks and had the Park Service block them and announce because it's federal property.
[00:02:13.152 --> 00:02:19.574]  Private parks run by private groups, privately funded, just like the World War II Memorial, no one is allowed in.
[00:02:19.594 --> 00:02:20.474]  And they have police
[00:02:21.734 --> 00:02:34.159]  Federal police there, so there's a lot of overtime going on in places that don't even normally have feds visiting them, to make sure you, the slaves, understand that they're going to control you with that.
[00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:49.706]  Just like they want to control you with health care, just like they want to control you with government-run education, dependency, slavery, modern slavery, may your chains set lightly upon you, as Patrick Henry said, is the name of the game.
[00:02:50.686 --> 00:03:09.158]  Now, that whole backdrop's going on while our crew, Anthony Gucciardi, working from StoryLeak.com with InfoWars.com, Weldon Henson from InfoWars, and of course some of the camera guys, Josh and others, are set to arrive at the NSA in
[00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.991]  Utah, outside Salt Lake City, as we speak.
[00:03:15.031 --> 00:03:18.993]  In fact, we have a live stream at Alex Jones Live on YouStreamUp.
[00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:24.796]  We have some backup streams, and we saw an error on the channel earlier, but it's back up now.
[00:03:24.816 --> 00:03:27.497]  Never seen that before, a 404 error.
[00:03:27.817 --> 00:03:30.698]  But they are now there with Weldon Henson driving.
[00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:36.141]  So there they are, if you're watching us on TV, you can see Weldon.
[00:03:36.621 --> 00:03:37.581]  Tell the difference between the two.
[00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:39.902]  I mean, it looks like it's one big military base now.
[00:03:40.703 --> 00:03:41.023]  Josh,
[00:03:41.858 --> 00:03:45.606]  Who works on film and editing and a production mastermind.
[00:03:46.127 --> 00:03:52.420]  Do you think they're going to try and take that camera equipment that we have over there and confiscate it from you because you're using a First Amendment?
[00:03:53.355 --> 00:04:01.859]  We'll see, but there's a good possibility that they're going to be pretty upset that we, the slaves, come and ask them questions.
[00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:08.462]  Because they can spy on our phones, they can look at our emails, look at everything that we do.
[00:04:09.022 --> 00:04:11.283]  I mean, the facility was surrounded by cameras.
[00:04:11.723 --> 00:04:15.605]  But if we come up there with two cameras, live streaming, one camera,
[00:04:16.903 --> 00:04:17.723]  They're going to be angry.
[00:04:18.123 --> 00:04:19.984]  Yeah, we're going to tell them that we're live streaming as well.
[00:04:20.024 --> 00:04:21.984]  So if they do anything, they'll be held accountable for it.
[00:04:22.004 --> 00:04:25.045]  I mean, as soon as we went up there yesterday, I mean, we had what?
[00:04:25.145 --> 00:04:26.025]  You hadn't even gotten done yet.
[00:04:26.045 --> 00:04:30.407]  And there was, you know, some kind of an intelligence officer driving by staring at us like we were terrorists.
[00:04:30.647 --> 00:04:31.427]  So that was interesting.
[00:04:31.447 --> 00:04:33.267]  By the way, let's fade that down, guys.
[00:04:33.287 --> 00:04:34.828]  We're going to come back from break.
[00:04:34.848 --> 00:04:35.728]  That's the live feed.
[00:04:35.768 --> 00:04:36.428]  They're about to arrive.
[00:04:36.488 --> 00:04:37.669]  We're going to be covering that.
[00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:42.090]  If you go to Infowars.com, in two different congressional hearings,
[00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:55.218]  And the NSA has come out, this is on Infowars.com, Chief of DHS calls privacy terrorism, and anyone calling for privacy terrorism, and the press is inherently terrorism.
[00:04:56.138 --> 00:04:57.299]  They actually say this.
[00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:03.963]  So see, anybody for freedom, anybody who's red-blooded, anybody who's not a total authoritarian is a terrorist.
[00:05:05.064 --> 00:05:08.406]  Because the government is run by terrorists, so obviously they say we're terrorists.

[00:06:20.182 --> 00:06:26.566]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.

[00:07:02.232 --> 00:07:08.895]  Visit GetSimplySafe.com GetSimplySafe.com GetSimplySafe.com
[00:07:10.157 --> 00:07:11.798]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:07:12.058 --> 00:07:15.560]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:20.123]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:07:20.243 --> 00:07:26.247]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:07:26.367 --> 00:07:37.133]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[00:07:37.353 --> 00:07:43.639]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:58.572]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[00:07:58.792 --> 00:08:01.293]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:08:01.393 --> 00:08:02.113]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:34.645 --> 00:08:46.959]  In the United States of America, land of the free, home of the brave, World War II veterans are being told they'll be arrested if they try to visit any of the national cemeteries, the World War II memorial.
[00:08:47.619 --> 00:08:48.921]  They have shut down the U.S.
[00:08:48.961 --> 00:08:53.225]  cemetery that's controlled by the Park Service in France.
[00:08:54.707 --> 00:08:59.748]  They are actually posting guards at places like Mount Vernon that's not even federally controlled.
[00:08:59.808 --> 00:09:01.588]  It's privately managed and funded.
[00:09:01.608 --> 00:09:14.511]  They are putting fences up, sending out overtime bureaucrats and armed police of the Park Service and others to try to frustrate and block the American people.
[00:09:14.951 --> 00:09:22.693]  And of course it came out yesterday, that's on direct orders of the anti-American, anti-gun, anti-family occupier.
[00:09:24.754 --> 00:09:25.454]  Of the White House.
[00:09:25.855 --> 00:09:32.879]  There is no doubt that the power structure is trying with everything they can to break this country.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:42.806]  And that we have a power structure at war with the nation, with our industry, with our power plants, with our people, with our families.
[00:09:43.266 --> 00:09:45.628]  We are under sustained military attack.
[00:09:46.468 --> 00:09:50.391]  Our own military itself has been captured by the Globalist and is waking up to this fact.
[00:09:50.911 --> 00:09:54.213]  The NSA Center is run by the Foreign Offshore Banks on record.
[00:09:54.573 --> 00:09:58.215]  They use it to control the markets, to rig the markets, to shut down their competition.
[00:09:59.576 --> 00:10:05.500]  The NSA base in Utah that just opened up, it's not been shut down during all of this.
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.822]  There are articles out at Infowars.com today.
[00:10:08.882 --> 00:10:09.943]  We're in Congress.
[00:10:10.783 --> 00:10:18.428]  The chief of the DHS openly came out and said it is terrorism or terrorist to want privacy.
[00:10:19.149 --> 00:10:21.150]  So wanting freedom is terrorism.
[00:10:21.611 --> 00:10:23.372]  Supporting freedom is evil.
[00:10:23.732 --> 00:10:25.934]  Because these people have occupied the nation.
[00:10:25.974 --> 00:10:27.855]  They are moving against us.
[00:10:28.556 --> 00:10:34.640]  And it's only realizing the total magnitude of this group who believes this country belongs to them.
[00:10:35.549 --> 00:10:39.673]  And who have seized control of the federal government that we have any chance of ever getting out of this.
[00:10:39.733 --> 00:10:50.742]  Now, I sent the crew to Utah to the NSA Center and they went and drove around it yesterday and shot some high def video for the upcoming film Obama Deception 2.
[00:10:52.124 --> 00:11:00.291]  They're going back today and are there right now and there is no live feed taking place right now.
[00:11:06.201 --> 00:11:15.614]  Okay, so we just talked to them over the phone and they're expecting to do a live feed again in five minutes and they are at the NSA Center right now.
[00:11:17.833 --> 00:11:19.734]  Okay, well I want to get them on the phone right now.
[00:11:19.854 --> 00:11:23.275]  Call them on the studio line, put Weldon on the phone right now.
[00:11:23.535 --> 00:11:26.837]  That's how we're going to do this, right now, here on air.
[00:11:26.877 --> 00:11:32.019]  Because I wanted them to continue to do live feeds as they drove towards the NSA Center.
[00:11:32.579 --> 00:11:37.461]  So they are about to arrive there in the next five to ten minutes.
[00:11:38.061 --> 00:11:45.031]  And then we'll have live feeds here on air of the paramilitary police and the army base that's attached to it.
[00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:48.235]  And Weldon was actually in the Air Force years ago.
[00:11:48.556 --> 00:11:50.498]  They're in Salt Lake, so he knows the area well.
[00:11:50.819 --> 00:11:52.000]  Weldon Henson, who went with him.
[00:11:53.131 --> 00:11:54.672]  from the Infowars operation.
[00:11:55.673 --> 00:12:04.842]  And when we've gone to the NSA Center in San Antonio, when we've gone to NSA Centers in D.C., they come out and act like you're bad videotaping them.
[00:12:05.083 --> 00:12:07.765]  These are people that track everything you do illegally on record.
[00:12:08.166 --> 00:12:10.228]  These are people that run Al Qaeda publicly.
[00:12:10.788 --> 00:12:23.371]  These are people that ship the narcotics in publicly, run by foreign banks that launder hundreds of billions a year publicly, that's in Bloomberg AP Reuters, and they sit there and act like you're evil and you're bad and you've done something wrong.
[00:12:23.411 --> 00:12:26.392]  It's like when cops come up and say, why are you videotaping me?
[00:12:26.492 --> 00:12:27.572]  I'm going to arrest you.
[00:12:28.232 --> 00:12:30.313]  When there's no law saying you can't videotape them.
[00:12:30.873 --> 00:12:34.594]  It is just a government completely rogue, completely out of control.
[00:12:35.959 --> 00:12:43.018]  And so we're going to see what happens once they get there with the live feed.
[00:12:44.762 --> 00:12:45.622]  Uh, coming up.
[00:12:46.223 --> 00:12:48.843]  So, we're going to be breaking all of that down today.
[00:12:49.044 --> 00:13:01.108]  And in NSA News, let me direct TV viewers and radio listeners to Infowars.com, but TV viewers can see this article from Washington's blog, uh, that links directly through to the Congressional Public Statements.
[00:13:01.688 --> 00:13:03.789]  Chief of DHS Privacy Officer.
[00:13:04.289 --> 00:13:07.230]  Government called Privacy Office terrorist.
[00:13:08.191 --> 00:13:10.832]  That's the Chief of the Privacy Office complaining that happened.
[00:13:11.072 --> 00:13:16.714]  Then they've got quotes from Hayden, who headed up the NSA, saying anyone that wants privacy is a terrorist.
[00:13:17.414 --> 00:13:17.835]  Boom!
[00:13:18.555 --> 00:13:19.755]  Okay, this is on record.
[00:13:19.795 --> 00:13:23.757]  You're a terrorist if you want any privacy.
[00:13:24.017 --> 00:13:32.800]  But the government, the rogue government, it wants total privacy and acts like the First Amendment is the ultimate sin and the equivalent of child sacrifice.
[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.201]  Now here's another one.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:41.585]  Phoenix Mayor defends police filming ASU tailgaters, surveilling them with the anti-terror teams.
[00:13:43.006 --> 00:13:53.714]  And we've got mainstream reports where they now call the public insurgents, and we're all treated as an enemy, and the government is an occupying force, because it is a globalist occupied army.
[00:13:54.255 --> 00:13:57.117]  Doesn't matter if you're a patriot and a cop, or in the military.
[00:13:57.417 --> 00:14:02.161]  The people running you, the people in control of it, are a seized government.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:09.483]  It'd be like if aliens landed and threatened to vaporize the earth if the military didn't go under their command and the military went under their command.
[00:14:09.503 --> 00:14:10.883]  It'd be the exact same thing.
[00:14:11.804 --> 00:14:13.444]  But these are our fellow humans.
[00:14:13.544 --> 00:14:17.306]  These are globalists that have done this and everyone is bowing down to them.
[00:14:17.726 --> 00:14:18.487]  Let's continue.
[00:14:19.387 --> 00:14:21.468]  California condemns indefinite detention.
[00:14:22.406 --> 00:14:25.948]  Passes a law saying they will not secretly arrest and disappear citizens.
[00:14:26.488 --> 00:14:35.894]  So, due to pressure, California has done the right thing and I thought nullification doesn't count when the states stand up for the Bill of Rights.
[00:14:35.914 --> 00:14:37.555]  Nullification does.
[00:14:38.416 --> 00:14:39.256]  Nullification does.
[00:14:41.056 --> 00:14:53.761]  Continuing with the NSA news, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee says we've got more info on NSA spying in the newspapers than from classified briefings.
[00:14:55.442 --> 00:14:56.863]  And he said that to
[00:14:58.288 --> 00:15:06.191]  But the Associated Press, and it's gotten almost no attention that the NSA will not tell Congress what's going on.
[00:15:06.431 --> 00:15:10.052]  See, that's a rogue government, a rogue bureaucracy.
[00:15:10.192 --> 00:15:11.813]  Obama says he doesn't have to go to Congress.
[00:15:13.741 --> 00:15:16.504]  For any approval for military strikes.
[00:15:16.964 --> 00:15:21.088]  So that is just some of the news on that front.
[00:15:21.108 --> 00:15:29.575]  We're going to get updates from the NSA report live here in just a moment via phone as they prepare to arrive and they start up the live feed.
[00:15:30.576 --> 00:15:32.378]  Which, by the way, I know Gucci already is on hold.
[00:15:32.398 --> 00:15:34.560]  They can start up a live feed anytime they want.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.222]  Continuing though, after we get into the NSA,
[00:15:38.999 --> 00:15:50.655]  Monuments and memorials remained open during previous shutdowns, reports the Daily Caller and links to the Associated Press from 1996 during the last government shutdown.
[00:15:50.735 --> 00:15:53.158]  None of them were shut down because they're open parks.
[00:15:54.119 --> 00:15:58.722]  More government expenditures are being spent to block the slaves from access.
[00:15:58.902 --> 00:16:04.906]  Because the truth is, almost the entire filthy, evil government is still operating like a wood chipper, destroying our freedom.
[00:16:05.206 --> 00:16:07.608]  They just want to give us the idea that it's all shut down.
[00:16:08.048 --> 00:16:10.790]  NBC reports, Founding Fathers Tavern.
[00:16:12.511 --> 00:16:13.712]  Closed by government.
[00:16:14.032 --> 00:16:14.593]  Shut down.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:19.522]  Troops forage for food while golfers play in the shutdown.
[00:16:19.542 --> 00:16:26.107]  They're keeping the government golf courses open but shutting down the areas where the army can eat to pull a stunt.
[00:16:27.267 --> 00:16:31.010]  Who needs the average enlisted to be able to eat as long as the officers can play golf and visit their
[00:16:31.992 --> 00:16:32.352]  Exactly.
[00:16:32.372 --> 00:16:33.853]  We're about five minutes away.
[00:16:33.873 --> 00:16:36.194]  We're on live stream right now.
[00:16:56.684 --> 00:16:57.585]  At the moment as well.
[00:16:58.045 --> 00:16:59.286]  And yes, we went yesterday.
[00:16:59.306 --> 00:17:06.791]  There is a military compound at Camp Williams, but it's hooked up to the NSA data center, the Eye of Sauron of the United States and New World Order.
[00:17:07.431 --> 00:17:13.035]  And there is a military outpost in the front, and there's a gate, and it looks like there's armed guards and everything like that.
[00:17:13.595 --> 00:17:18.118]  And we also noticed indications of underground bunkers and a number of crazy things.
[00:17:18.519 --> 00:17:19.399]  And we went up.
[00:17:19.439 --> 00:17:20.780]  We didn't even go try to go in.
[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:23.042]  We were just scoping it out yesterday to see how far it would get.
[00:17:23.062 --> 00:17:26.144]  Now it's snowing, so it's taking a little longer and it's wet up now.
[00:17:26.864 --> 00:17:42.840]  So we went around and we were met with unmarked federal slash police cars circling us, we got it on camera, in an attempt to threaten us and intimidate us to not even dare to stop the vehicle within 100 yards of the NSA spy center.
[00:17:44.011 --> 00:17:47.414]  Well, they'll also have signs saying photography prohibited.
[00:17:47.654 --> 00:17:48.715]  You're not on the base.
[00:17:49.055 --> 00:17:49.956]  There is no law.
[00:17:49.976 --> 00:17:51.517]  You can look at it with Google Maps.
[00:17:51.878 --> 00:17:55.501]  They're all spying on us illegally, telling us our First Amendment's illegal.
[00:17:55.721 --> 00:17:59.004]  So when they say, don't you see the signs, say, don't you see the First Amendment.
[00:17:59.364 --> 00:18:02.165]  When they ask you for your ID, you demand theirs first.
[00:18:02.225 --> 00:18:03.305]  We've done this before.
[00:18:03.925 --> 00:18:08.967]  And you can also tell them, you know federal courts have ruled we can stand outside and videotape this.
[00:18:09.287 --> 00:18:13.148]  They used to arrest people until a couple years ago when they lost in federal court.
[00:18:13.708 --> 00:18:16.568]  And you guys are doing a great job to defend our First Amendment.
[00:18:16.869 --> 00:18:18.189]  What they're doing is illegal.
[00:18:18.769 --> 00:18:20.170]  It's not to protect America.
[00:18:20.631 --> 00:18:24.093]  It is a foreign command base to spy on America.
[00:18:24.133 --> 00:18:25.634]  That's why it's hooked onto an army base.
[00:18:26.055 --> 00:18:30.538]  This is a command base to run the technocracy during the shutdown of America.
[00:18:30.798 --> 00:18:36.323]  It might as well be an alien mothership landed in Utah to run operations against us.
[00:18:37.927 --> 00:18:38.647]  No, exactly.
[00:18:38.988 --> 00:18:45.211]  And furthermore, they even have a back entrance, and when we went around there, the same thing, these unmarked cars would come around.
[00:18:45.231 --> 00:18:46.531]  It's instantaneous.
[00:18:46.591 --> 00:18:57.117]  I mean, this is the most heavily armed facility I think I've ever seen with, in terms of, they are calling in real time the military police, or whatever they are, the federal government, I have no idea.
[00:18:57.677 --> 00:18:59.798]  And even when we're not even stopping and doing anything.
[00:18:59.898 --> 00:19:03.060]  I mean, we're literally stopping the car and just looking at it, and they're like, better send someone else
[00:19:03.817 --> 00:19:08.600]  You have to understand, you are designated, this has come out in Congress, as a terrorist.
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:12.522]  All Americans are terrorists, because this is the foreign army of the New World Order.
[00:19:12.862 --> 00:19:13.943]  This is the Redcoats.
[00:19:13.983 --> 00:19:21.287]  This is the captured federal government, spending hundreds of billions of dollars with giant NSA command centers, already built all over the country.
[00:19:21.607 --> 00:19:23.767]  Building huge ones in San Antonio, Dallas.
[00:19:24.208 --> 00:19:26.848]  There's one by my house in my neighborhood, a substation.
[00:19:27.468 --> 00:19:28.889]  All the agencies dialed in.
[00:19:28.989 --> 00:19:30.249]  Obamacare dialed in.
[00:19:30.529 --> 00:19:31.369]  The IRS.
[00:19:32.229 --> 00:19:37.931]  Schools from California to Pennsylvania washing kids over their laptops at home.
[00:19:38.351 --> 00:19:41.912]  I mean, this is the total Ministry of Truth Orwell Command Center.
[00:19:41.932 --> 00:19:43.332]  We're going to come back to you, Anthony.
[00:19:44.332 --> 00:19:46.633]  The live feed is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:19:48.074 --> 00:19:52.416]  Folks can go to InfoWars.com and see our live stream posted up there for everybody.

[00:20:03.208 --> 00:20:10.038]  To the biological androids who think they work for America, who actually work for the foreign Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan occupiers.
[00:20:10.639 --> 00:20:12.802]  So, you've decided to get prepared.
[00:20:13.003 --> 00:20:19.012]  You're not sure that a case of ramen and a couple of granola bars under your bed will cut it as long-term food storage anymore.
[00:20:19.192 --> 00:20:19.853]  You're in luck.
[00:20:20.013 --> 00:20:23.436]  At Emergency Essentials, we have all the resources to get you started.

[00:20:41.633 --> 00:20:45.954]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:46.114 --> 00:20:51.735]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:53.935]  Gold has outperformed paper investments yet.
[00:20:53.995 --> 00:20:55.176]  No word about IRAs.
[00:20:55.416 --> 00:21:00.076]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:00.196 --> 00:21:02.897]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[00:21:16.359 --> 00:21:24.345]  Men who were formerly taking ED medication are now reporting that a secret underground video has restored their male performance better than pills.
[00:21:24.665 --> 00:21:32.851]  These men say this secret underground video is bringing back the male performance and sensation they've been missing for years, and it's working better than pills.
[00:21:33.151 --> 00:21:34.352]  Things are so much better now.
[00:21:34.733 --> 00:21:36.994]  Everything kinda came back overnight.
[00:21:37.154 --> 00:21:39.596]  My girlfriend is very happy.
[00:21:39.716 --> 00:21:43.097]  I purchased your product yesterday, and it was fantastic.
[00:21:43.197 --> 00:21:46.838]  I have used your system for about three weeks, and I'm already seeing great results.
[00:21:47.099 --> 00:21:53.261]  The owner of this video has reported the overwhelming bandwidth costs may necessitate his taking this video down.

[00:22:09.406 --> 00:22:15.031]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[00:22:15.171 --> 00:22:22.396]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[00:22:22.556 --> 00:22:25.719]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[00:22:25.859 --> 00:22:27.640]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:32.461]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.

[00:22:35.462 --> 00:22:41.243]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.

[00:22:53.507 --> 00:22:59.370]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.

[00:23:09.475 --> 00:23:12.397]  A healthy digestive system supports a healthy immune system.
[00:23:13.377 --> 00:23:17.019]  And a healthy immune system protects you against infections and disease.
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:22.803]  Pro-EM1 Daily Probiotic Cleanse, available at Terragonics.com, is the key to digestive health.

[00:24:16.494 --> 00:24:30.567]  Every move you make, every breath you take, the NSA and Big Brother is watching you to fix the stock market, to shut down mom and pops, to actuary out how to bring in agenda 21 and de-industrialize this country and collectivize us.
[00:24:30.647 --> 00:24:41.717]  And Anthony Gucciardi reporting for InfoWars.com and StoryLeak.com is at NSA headquarters with InfoWars, Weldon Henson and Josh and others from our great crew.
[00:24:42.598 --> 00:24:45.560]  The reason I'm not saying Josh's last name, he's worked here a while and does a great job.
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:47.361]  I don't even know if Josh wants his full name on air.
[00:24:47.421 --> 00:24:52.965]  Some of our folks like to stay incognito with the NSA as if the NSA doesn't already know Big Brother.
[00:24:53.025 --> 00:24:55.106]  They are now arriving at the base.
[00:24:55.566 --> 00:24:56.567]  They have army bases.
[00:24:56.587 --> 00:24:59.549]  You can see the guard towers in the live feed.
[00:24:59.569 --> 00:25:02.831]  They're to keep the slaves out and keep the criminal operation going.
[00:25:03.331 --> 00:25:05.953]  They also use it to spy on drug dealers that aren't paying their cut.
[00:25:06.373 --> 00:25:08.875]  That's come out in the Associated Press years after we told you.
[00:25:09.375 --> 00:25:13.979]  There's the military base on the edge of the giant NSA command base.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:18.844]  Anthony, closing comments on the phone before we flip over to your live feed.
[00:25:19.585 --> 00:25:23.287]  Exactly, so we're now right up here on the NSA data center.
[00:25:23.347 --> 00:25:28.510]  As you've seen on the live feed, you can see the military outpost, the tower, the data center itself, which is massive.
[00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:36.755]  And this entire time, the last three, four minutes we've been talking, we've been driving along the outskirts of this massive eye of Sauron.
[00:25:37.055 --> 00:25:38.376]  This is a dangerous thing right now.
[00:25:38.416 --> 00:25:42.418]  If you're watching live at InputWords.com, this live stream, we're going to approach the NSA.
[00:25:43.639 --> 00:25:43.879]  I'm good.
[00:26:02.108 --> 00:26:11.452]  Absolutely, and they're putting signs up even outside the base under color of law fraud to act like you're bad if you even approach your taxpayer-paid-for grid.
[00:26:11.792 --> 00:26:13.753]  I'm going to get off the phone with you now, Anthony.
[00:26:14.413 --> 00:26:16.915]  Just take your time, get out of the car, stay focused.
[00:26:17.395 --> 00:26:18.775]  Tell them this is still America.
[00:26:18.895 --> 00:26:21.316]  Tell them you know that they are running a criminal operation.
[00:26:21.597 --> 00:26:23.097]  We're going to go to your live feed now.
[00:26:23.157 --> 00:26:25.058]  Go ahead and disconnect the phone and get ready.
[00:26:25.098 --> 00:26:26.499]  Great job, Anthony Gucciardi.
[00:26:27.219 --> 00:26:28.840]  Let's now... Thank you.
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:29.960]  Everybody's praying for you.
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:31.040]  This is such a free country.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.881]  Now, we need more people.
[00:26:33.021 --> 00:26:35.562]  Remember, 15 years ago, they said this didn't even exist.
[00:26:36.082 --> 00:26:37.322]  The NSA echelon.
[00:26:37.682 --> 00:26:39.283]  The media would actually say it didn't exist.
[00:26:39.323 --> 00:26:40.023]  The controlled media.
[00:26:40.483 --> 00:26:44.304]  Now, they're forced to admit they're doing it, and now we're having an open debate.
[00:26:45.085 --> 00:26:46.385]  So, let's go to the live feed.
[00:26:46.445 --> 00:26:47.765]  It'll be about 30 seconds delayed.
[00:26:47.805 --> 00:26:48.626]  Let's go to that right now.
[00:26:48.646 --> 00:26:49.626]  Alright, here we go.
[00:26:50.834 --> 00:26:52.056]  This is the official live feed.
[00:26:52.096 --> 00:26:53.758]  We are now entering the NSA back.
[00:26:53.798 --> 00:26:56.541]  We were going to go into the military establishment, but we couldn't resist.
[00:26:57.062 --> 00:27:01.067]  There's so many signs here saying, do not go in here.
[00:27:01.387 --> 00:27:02.568]  Essentially, you'll be arrested.
[00:27:02.809 --> 00:27:04.190]  No filming whatsoever.
[00:27:04.511 --> 00:27:06.774]  This is complete surveillance state on us.
[00:27:07.074 --> 00:27:07.735]  All these cameras.
[00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:11.294]  Yet, we're not allowed to even film with an iPhone.
[00:27:11.715 --> 00:27:12.476]  Which is what we're using right now.
[00:27:12.496 --> 00:27:13.617]  That's because they're committing crime!
[00:27:14.779 --> 00:27:15.200]  Inside!
[00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:16.482]  They said we couldn't get in the parking lot.
[00:27:16.622 --> 00:27:19.866]  Everyone told me, there's no way you're gonna get in the parking lot.
[00:27:20.207 --> 00:27:23.031]  You will be arrested before you even set foot in the parking lot.
[00:27:23.051 --> 00:27:23.472]  Here we are.
[00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:26.331]  These guys are as bad as the World War II vets!
[00:27:27.031 --> 00:27:28.572]  Going in the memorial!
[00:27:28.632 --> 00:27:29.452]  But, here we are.
[00:27:46.516 --> 00:27:47.477]  I see a good spot right over there.
[00:27:47.497 --> 00:27:48.178]  I'm going to go grab it.
[00:27:48.858 --> 00:27:49.379]  Alright.
[00:27:49.399 --> 00:27:51.241]  Well, I wonder what that building is over there.
[00:27:51.261 --> 00:27:52.162]  I don't know.
[00:27:52.642 --> 00:27:53.863]  We should get another camera film too.
[00:27:54.644 --> 00:27:56.146]  I see a spot over there where we can get it.
[00:27:57.767 --> 00:27:59.970]  Yeah, so, here we are.
[00:28:01.531 --> 00:28:04.134]  We're trying to figure out what's even going on.
[00:28:04.895 --> 00:28:07.676]  Their directive is to go find the PAO.
[00:28:07.696 --> 00:28:09.437]  Or the PIO.
[00:28:09.517 --> 00:28:10.757]  Public Information Officer.
[00:28:11.057 --> 00:28:12.978]  Or Public Affairs.
[00:28:13.078 --> 00:28:13.678]  In both names.
[00:28:13.738 --> 00:28:15.379]  And again, this isn't even supposed to exist.
[00:28:31.335 --> 00:28:33.697]  That don't understand what's going on.
[00:28:33.737 --> 00:28:39.340]  I mean, there's people that are actually somewhat patriotic in many ways, but they think that government spying is a good thing.
[00:28:39.961 --> 00:28:41.482]  They just don't understand at all.
[00:28:41.542 --> 00:28:45.524]  So that's why when I told people that we're going here, their brain almost blew up.
[00:28:46.145 --> 00:28:47.606]  Like, you're going to the NSA?
[00:28:47.846 --> 00:28:49.387]  You'll get arrested for just looking at it.
[00:28:49.447 --> 00:28:50.327]  They couldn't even understand.
[00:28:50.507 --> 00:28:52.309]  That's how intimidated America's gotten.
[00:28:52.949 --> 00:28:58.773]  Start filming with the full setup and most likely cause some problems here.
[00:29:00.391 --> 00:29:02.932]  Those spots are reserved for low emission vehicles only.
[00:29:02.952 --> 00:29:08.155]  The mission is spying on the American people illegally.
[00:29:08.795 --> 00:29:10.876]  How dare journalists go to the NSA?
[00:29:11.136 --> 00:29:12.317]  Nobody's supposed to do this.
[00:29:12.697 --> 00:29:13.357]  They're God.
[00:29:13.437 --> 00:29:14.318]  They're above the law.
[00:29:19.073 --> 00:29:20.114]  This is a hard break.
[00:29:20.614 --> 00:29:25.636]  We gotta go to break on radio, but the live feed just went up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:29:25.656 --> 00:29:26.917]  Hit refresh.
[00:29:27.897 --> 00:29:30.038]  It's Alex Jones live on YouTube.
[00:29:31.619 --> 00:29:33.280]  Alex Jones live on Ustream.
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:37.362]  Right now we have backup streams as well up on InfoWars.com.
[00:29:37.582 --> 00:29:41.264]  And this is the military base entrance.
[00:29:41.664 --> 00:29:44.385]  Then they're gonna go over to the civilian entrance.
[00:29:46.391 --> 00:29:47.872]  Maybe they're fans of the show and they heard.
[00:29:47.892 --> 00:29:49.553]  Oh, they're watching right now.
[00:29:49.593 --> 00:29:50.233]  You better believe it.
[00:29:50.593 --> 00:29:55.176]  They are staring at us like we're some type of goblins or something.
[00:29:56.416 --> 00:29:57.137]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:57.157 --> 00:29:57.957]  Stay with us, folks.
[00:29:59.698 --> 00:30:00.599]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.099 --> 00:30:02.700]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:06.322]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.595 --> 00:30:11.596]  Ben Swan here.
[00:30:11.836 --> 00:30:12.957]  We are winning.
[00:30:13.017 --> 00:30:20.261]  Alternative media is challenging and beating mainstream media, and it's imperative for the liberty movement to continue this momentum.
[00:30:20.742 --> 00:30:27.326]  However, independent media cannot win without the support of sponsors and advertisers like Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:30:27.766 --> 00:30:33.130]  For over 26 years, Diamond Gusset has been owned by patriots with products designed for patriots.
[00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:39.133]  When I put on a pair of Diamond Gusset jeans, I enjoy the quality, comfort, durability and style.
[00:30:39.654 --> 00:30:42.455]  Most importantly, my wife really likes them as well.
[00:30:42.976 --> 00:30:50.160]  From the cotton to the last stitch, Diamond Gusset bucks the industry standard by producing a 100% all-American product.
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:51.881]  Another reason for my endorsement.
[00:30:52.421 --> 00:30:56.605]  So, Ben Swan is asking you to go visit DiamondLiberty.com right now.
[00:30:56.946 --> 00:31:03.592]  With promo code BEN, you will receive a 20% off discount on a pair of male or female Diamond Gusset jeans.

[00:31:10.922 --> 00:31:16.044]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[00:31:16.384 --> 00:31:24.868]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[00:31:25.288 --> 00:31:32.591]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[00:31:33.111 --> 00:31:40.514]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[00:31:41.014 --> 00:31:44.416]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[00:31:44.956 --> 00:31:48.599]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.
[00:31:49.159 --> 00:31:55.743]  For a limited time, you can save $50 instantly on a four-week supply of food, along with other special offers.

[00:32:03.507 --> 00:32:07.550]  It is essential to prepare with My Patriot Supply today.
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:23.729]  With over 3,000 years of historic use, Pure Silver continues to be one of nature's most reliable and effective agents against fighting viruses, mold, fungus, bacteria, pathogens and parasites.

[00:33:04.697 --> 00:33:07.920]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:33:21.614 --> 00:33:24.617]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:25.178 --> 00:33:29.342]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:32.688 --> 00:33:46.960]  Well, here we are trying to direct our guys from Austin, Texas, where I'm sitting here at the Infowars First Amendment Liberty Center in defense of the Republic in the spirit of 1776 and all the basic Bill of Rights and Constitution that our forebears fought and died for.
[00:33:48.101 --> 00:33:54.927]  Trying to communicate with the crew, and I've told them to get the camera closer to the police so we can hear it.
[00:33:54.947 --> 00:33:56.148]  It's very windy out there.
[00:33:57.890 --> 00:33:58.250]  Here we go.
[00:33:58.270 --> 00:33:59.351]  Let's see if we can hear what they're saying.
[00:34:01.434 --> 00:34:02.496]  This is at the NSA Criminal Center.
[00:34:02.516 --> 00:34:03.597]  This is the NSA Occupation Center.
[00:34:04.198 --> 00:34:05.580]  It isn't supposed to exist.
[00:34:05.801 --> 00:34:06.341]  The Spy Center.
[00:34:19.346 --> 00:34:21.448]  They want to turn the cameras off so they can arrest everybody.
[00:34:22.229 --> 00:34:24.591]  And make stuff up, probably.
[00:34:24.611 --> 00:34:25.732]  At least in my experience.
[00:34:26.253 --> 00:34:27.634]  They're coming with the police.
[00:34:27.754 --> 00:34:28.936]  Listen, Alex.
[00:34:29.756 --> 00:34:30.657]  We're talking live on it.
[00:34:30.677 --> 00:34:32.159]  We're just talking.
[00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:33.200]  We're live on it right now.
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:35.342]  Yeah, put Gucci Arty on air.
[00:34:35.502 --> 00:34:37.304]  Look, look, look.
[00:34:37.344 --> 00:34:38.805]  They're spying on everybody.
[00:34:40.067 --> 00:34:41.368]  Listen, they're calling in their buddies.
[00:34:41.388 --> 00:34:43.050]  They're about to confiscate all of our cameras right now.
[00:34:43.666 --> 00:34:45.187]  Well, just keep the live feed rolling.
[00:34:45.247 --> 00:34:46.107]  It's First Amendment.
[00:34:46.127 --> 00:34:47.848]  We're saying we're on live feed, First Amendment.
[00:34:48.208 --> 00:34:49.309]  We're saying First Amendment.
[00:34:49.329 --> 00:34:50.529]  We just want to ask some questions.
[00:34:50.890 --> 00:34:51.990]  That's right, you're the press.
[00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:53.671]  He's about to take the camera for Josh.
[00:34:55.595 --> 00:34:56.356]  Aim the camera at him.
[00:34:56.376 --> 00:34:56.996]  Listen, sir.
[00:34:57.016 --> 00:34:57.656]  Listen, sir.
[00:34:57.676 --> 00:35:00.018]  Here, you want to talk live on Alex Jones on air?
[00:35:00.038 --> 00:35:02.199]  Do you want to talk to the NSA agent live on air, Alex?
[00:35:02.559 --> 00:35:06.021]  Yes, I want to talk to the people trying to violate the First Amendment.
[00:35:06.181 --> 00:35:06.681]  Hey, guys.
[00:35:06.821 --> 00:35:08.482]  We're just journalists here.
[00:35:09.403 --> 00:35:10.323]  We're just journalists.
[00:35:11.084 --> 00:35:12.064]  We're just trying.
[00:35:12.465 --> 00:35:14.566]  We're live-streaming right now on Alex Jones Show.
[00:35:14.606 --> 00:35:15.246]  Hey, excuse me.
[00:35:15.306 --> 00:35:15.907]  Excuse me.
[00:35:15.967 --> 00:35:16.527]  Hey, hey.
[00:35:16.747 --> 00:35:17.407]  He cut the live feed.
[00:35:17.467 --> 00:35:19.008]  These guys love to scare Americans.
[00:35:19.048 --> 00:35:20.889]  They love to try to intimidate everybody.
[00:35:20.909 --> 00:35:22.030]  They're taking the cameras.
[00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:23.451]  They're taking the cameras right now.
[00:35:24.816 --> 00:35:26.277]  There you go, national incident.
[00:35:26.618 --> 00:35:30.100]  You can't pull up in a parking lot in America.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.282]  There you have the NSA people grabbing the camera.
[00:35:32.302 --> 00:35:35.064]  In a parking lot on the edge of the base.
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:36:06.226]  These are the people on the edge of the base, pretending the First Amendment's illegal, pretending we're bad when the NSA's on record committing mass crime, the NSA Director's on record lying to Congress.
[00:36:06.466 --> 00:36:06.886]  Turn it off.
[00:36:07.146 --> 00:36:07.747]  How do I turn it off?
[00:36:07.767 --> 00:36:08.527]  I'll pull the battery off.
[00:36:09.488 --> 00:36:10.688]  Just tell me how to turn it off.
[00:36:10.828 --> 00:36:12.149]  Look, they don't know how to turn the phone off.
[00:36:12.349 --> 00:36:12.889]  It's a phone.
[00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:17.372]  They're trying to turn the big camera off instead of the live feed.
[00:36:18.532 --> 00:36:20.113]  It's public affairs or something.
[00:36:21.243 --> 00:36:21.844]  Yeah, they were sent.
[00:36:21.924 --> 00:36:24.306]  I just sent my guys to the front of the base to talk to Public Affairs.
[00:36:24.347 --> 00:36:30.193]  That's their directive, as we said earlier.
[00:36:30.994 --> 00:36:32.135]  That's what they went to do.
[00:36:32.336 --> 00:36:33.977]  We've called them and they didn't call us back, by the way.
[00:36:41.377 --> 00:36:41.937]  No big deal.
[00:36:42.197 --> 00:36:43.158]  You know what John Wayne said?
[00:36:43.238 --> 00:36:44.498]  It's not about being the best shot.
[00:36:44.518 --> 00:36:46.399]  It's not about being the quickest draw.
[00:36:46.619 --> 00:36:47.580]  It's about being willing.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:48.960]  It's about showing up.
[00:36:49.921 --> 00:36:53.782]  We're showing up in the Infowar to expose the illegal NSA.
[00:36:54.183 --> 00:36:58.004]  There should be a million man march on these facilities for our First Amendment.
[00:36:58.144 --> 00:36:59.005]  We're sick of it!
[00:36:59.025 --> 00:37:04.607]  And I salute the World War II veterans that are going across the line of the old barricades.
[00:37:04.947 --> 00:37:05.988]  The Obama-cades.
[00:37:06.008 --> 00:37:08.249]  Y'all got any snow over this side of the mountain today or what?
[00:37:08.849 --> 00:37:09.509]  Hope so.
[00:37:09.529 --> 00:37:10.690]  Y'all got any so far this year?
[00:37:13.845 --> 00:37:22.590]  You're hearing a live feed from the parking lot outside the NSA criminal spying Big Brother Tyranny Center.
[00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:27.073]  Everybody's supposed to grovel in fear to these people.
[00:37:27.093 --> 00:37:30.075]  They all know the courts have ruled you can go up to the parking lot and film.
[00:37:30.636 --> 00:37:32.017]  Five federal court rulings.
[00:37:32.397 --> 00:37:32.877]  Five!
[00:37:33.197 --> 00:37:33.618]  Five!
[00:37:34.358 --> 00:37:37.462]  Type into Google, it's not illegal to film government buildings or NSA.
[00:37:38.003 --> 00:37:39.945]  Washington Post, Associated Press.
[00:37:40.166 --> 00:37:41.828]  But everybody's scared to go do this.
[00:37:41.848 --> 00:37:44.071]  Everybody's scared to act like free people.
[00:37:49.263 --> 00:37:52.165]  It's a protected government facility, obviously you know that.
[00:37:52.185 --> 00:37:56.427]  We get out and say, don't come back unless you're invited.
[00:37:56.988 --> 00:37:57.748]  Contact the PAO.
[00:37:57.788 --> 00:37:59.949]  They'll be more than happy to talk to you.
[00:37:59.969 --> 00:38:00.730]  That's their job.
[00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:01.070]  That's it.
[00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:02.731]  All I have is this on me.
[00:38:02.771 --> 00:38:02.911]  Sorry.
[00:38:16.645 --> 00:38:25.316]  And by the way, when we went to cover Pittsburgh, we had it all on video politely at the Army base, at the National Guard Center where they had regular Army.
[00:38:25.776 --> 00:38:32.384]  They lied and said we threatened to kill them and had the police threaten to arrest my guys and go to their hotel.
[00:38:32.684 --> 00:38:33.605]  They just finally cut the feed.
[00:38:34.346 --> 00:38:34.686]  Is that it?
[00:38:34.706 --> 00:38:35.527]  They finally cut the feed.
[00:38:36.287 --> 00:38:42.090]  And we had total footage when they pulled up the military base, said, we called earlier, we'd like to talk to your PIO or PAO.
[00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:44.131]  And they come over, they say, who are you?
[00:38:44.151 --> 00:38:44.811]  We're Infowars.
[00:38:45.091 --> 00:38:45.892]  They see the camera.
[00:38:46.192 --> 00:38:46.712]  We leave.
[00:38:47.092 --> 00:38:47.993]  The police come.
[00:38:48.073 --> 00:38:50.914]  And then the police call me and say, we're going to arrest your reporters.
[00:38:50.954 --> 00:38:54.116]  In fact, I called the cops back and famously aired that live on the radio.
[00:38:54.156 --> 00:38:54.736]  People remember.
[00:38:55.156 --> 00:38:56.937]  And I said, we have it all on footage, cops.
[00:38:57.338 --> 00:38:58.778]  We didn't threaten to blow up the base.
[00:38:58.798 --> 00:38:59.699]  It was blow up the base.
[00:39:00.419 --> 00:39:02.441]  And the cop went, oh, you've got it all taped.
[00:39:02.461 --> 00:39:14.153]  And I said, yeah, before you frame us for trying to bomb the National Guard Armory, and see to them, in the case of Pittsburgh, framing Americans was no big deal.
[00:39:15.151 --> 00:39:24.014]  Just like when I covered, in Brooksville, Florida, with Mike Hanson, an urban warfare drill, we have footage of locals saying, we've been told don't talk to Alex Jones, you're crazy.
[00:39:24.455 --> 00:39:31.517]  And then, they had a special forces guy start, jump out of the woods, when I was trying to film the maneuvers, and start setting fires.
[00:39:32.178 --> 00:39:34.078]  Going, shouldn't have set fires, Alex!
[00:39:34.418 --> 00:39:40.461]  And I had to put the fire out, and basically tackle the guy, to stop him from setting fires and blaming it on us.
[00:39:41.081 --> 00:39:43.783]  And I told the guys before they went, this is no joke.
[00:39:44.103 --> 00:39:44.823]  This is no game.
[00:39:44.863 --> 00:39:47.625]  You are lower than an Iraqi to them, okay?
[00:39:47.885 --> 00:39:50.527]  You are lower than a Serb to them.
[00:39:50.827 --> 00:39:52.388]  You are the ultimate enemy.
[00:39:52.428 --> 00:39:55.230]  You're a red-blooded American that doesn't want to be a slave.
[00:39:55.830 --> 00:40:02.915]  And I want to be clear, these average cops out there are just utterly do-right, and think they have the moral authority, and they're probably not bad people.
[00:40:03.515 --> 00:40:06.457]  But, that's what we thought at the military base in Pittsburgh.
[00:40:06.677 --> 00:40:08.698]  Then they arrested Rabdu,
[00:40:09.739 --> 00:40:13.220]  Took them to a torture center where they set everybody out in the rain all night.
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:17.822]  And I'm not going to get into everything else they did to other people because it's pretty humiliating, but it's bad.
[00:40:19.123 --> 00:40:19.903]  They had the U.S.
[00:40:19.983 --> 00:40:24.465]  Army with the National Guard and the police and we sued them and we won.
[00:40:25.399 --> 00:40:29.861]  So, you're all on notice, and I know the NSA can plant stuff on my computer.
[00:40:30.121 --> 00:40:31.381]  I know you guys can come kill me.
[00:40:31.602 --> 00:40:32.282]  Go ahead!
[00:40:32.702 --> 00:40:34.183]  I don't want to die, but I'm not scared.
[00:40:34.263 --> 00:40:34.803]  I'm committed.
[00:40:35.163 --> 00:40:35.923]  I know I'm right.
[00:40:36.083 --> 00:40:36.644]  I'm committed.
[00:40:36.904 --> 00:40:40.165]  Like John Paul Jones, when they said, are you ready to surrender?
[00:40:40.425 --> 00:40:42.646]  When his ship was sinking, and he said, I've only begun to fight.
[00:40:43.006 --> 00:40:44.167]  And he ended up taking them down.
[00:40:44.647 --> 00:40:46.147]  We have only begun to fight.
[00:40:46.327 --> 00:40:47.388]  We're never giving up.
[00:40:47.568 --> 00:40:48.728]  We're never backing down.
[00:40:48.929 --> 00:40:49.869]  We're never stopping.
[00:40:50.089 --> 00:40:51.530]  We know what's going on.
[00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:53.370]  We understand the globalist occupation.
[00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:54.751]  We're aware of what's happening.
[00:40:56.118 --> 00:41:01.383]  I've been wound up today, folks, it's because Gucciardi had the idea.
[00:41:01.884 --> 00:41:03.305]  I am absolutely stuck here.
[00:41:03.345 --> 00:41:04.927]  I've been to the NSA before in D.C.
[00:41:04.987 --> 00:41:08.671]  and Jacari and others went down earlier this year to San Antonio.
[00:41:09.892 --> 00:41:11.914]  And the same thing basically happened that just happened now.
[00:41:12.755 --> 00:41:19.882]  And Gucciardi said we ought to go to the NSA Center and point out that they're not being shut down during a government shutdown.
[00:41:21.263 --> 00:41:23.205]  And I said, OK, you want to go to San Antonio?
[00:41:23.225 --> 00:41:25.127]  He goes, no, let's go to the really big one in Utah.
[00:41:25.788 --> 00:41:26.809]  So I said, who wants to go?
[00:41:26.829 --> 00:41:27.550]  Around the office.
[00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:33.776]  And Weldon Henson, who's an Air Force veteran and loves Utah, was stationed up there for many years.
[00:41:34.016 --> 00:41:34.837]  He said, I want to go.
[00:41:35.298 --> 00:41:41.524]  The head of my shipping department and product procurement department with Tim Preget just does a great job, great patriot.
[00:41:42.165 --> 00:41:45.307]  A good friend of mine, he wanted to go, and he's never been reporting for us.
[00:41:45.347 --> 00:41:49.269]  He wanted to go do it, because I guess it was what you'd see as a dangerous mission for freedom.
[00:41:49.529 --> 00:41:53.312]  See, there's a spirit of defeating the tyranny that everybody wants to be involved in it.
[00:41:53.652 --> 00:41:55.793]  And that's the spirit that's going to defeat the tyranny, folks.
[00:41:56.174 --> 00:41:58.035]  And then Josh wanted to go, so they're there.
[00:41:58.615 --> 00:42:04.719]  And I told him, I said, listen, they're going to take your cameras, and then they're going to try to intimidate you and threaten you once they're turned off.
[00:42:04.999 --> 00:42:08.541]  You've got to say, good, set me up, lie, be evil.
[00:42:08.861 --> 00:42:11.603]  You are going to end up going to jail when we take this country back.
[00:42:11.843 --> 00:42:13.805]  And then they'll release you, because I've been through this before.
[00:42:14.446 --> 00:42:15.146]  It's like a spirit.
[00:42:15.186 --> 00:42:21.633]  If they think you're scared, and they think that you're groveling, if you just go, fine, set me up, do whatever you're going to do, it's on you.
[00:42:22.293 --> 00:42:24.255]  God's going to deal with you.
[00:42:24.535 --> 00:42:26.898]  They literally, in every case, start shaking.
[00:42:27.398 --> 00:42:28.319]  Because you're not afraid.
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.282]  I had this happen with Delta Force down in San Antonio.
[00:42:31.462 --> 00:42:32.903]  They did take our footage in that case.
[00:42:33.284 --> 00:42:35.065]  And Mike Hanson would not give them the camera.
[00:42:35.686 --> 00:42:38.089]  This is right outside the military base, Fort Sam Houston.
[00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:40.793]  The Delta Force ordered him over there because we were covering the drill.
[00:42:41.374 --> 00:42:46.901]  And pulled out his Beretta and stuck it right to Hansen's chest and said, I'm going to tell you one more time to give me that camera.
[00:42:47.542 --> 00:42:48.984]  And Mike, by the way, didn't give it to him.
[00:42:49.264 --> 00:42:51.788]  And then he said, holstered the gun and grabbed it away from him.
[00:42:52.947 --> 00:42:56.308]  I gotta be honest with you, I was ready to give up the camera before he pulled the gun out.
[00:42:56.728 --> 00:42:58.569]  Because, you know, we're gonna win this thing.
[00:42:58.589 --> 00:42:59.629]  That's the thing about Mike.
[00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:01.690]  I never told the story, he didn't want it told.
[00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:06.412]  We were in another case where people pulled guns on us, and Mike literally blew up and told them to go ahead and shoot him.
[00:43:07.757 --> 00:43:18.841]  Oh yeah, that was quite a case one other time with some ill-billied folks who were trying to help out and then the feds went and told them we were feds the next time we showed up and they were telling us we were feds and Mike blew up at them and they had guns.
[00:43:19.781 --> 00:43:23.563]  We started pointing them and Mike's like, go ahead, I'm not afraid of you, you scum, you white trash!
[00:43:23.883 --> 00:43:27.304]  That's the thing about Mike Hanson!
[00:43:28.024 --> 00:43:30.665]  Anyways, I'm gonna shut up, I'm not gonna tell any more of the story.
[00:43:31.125 --> 00:43:32.646]  I just started having flashbacks
[00:43:33.937 --> 00:43:34.177]  All right.
[00:44:04.217 --> 00:44:10.983]  I don't care how much of it you push and you shove, the spirit of 1776 is rising again.
[00:44:12.083 --> 00:44:24.293]  They won't let us have industry, they won't let us have jobs, they're shutting down our power plants, but they built a giant power plant just for that NSA Center, the first thing they built five years ago, when they broke ground on that abomination.
[00:44:25.566 --> 00:44:30.128]  So, you see, they get power, they get money, they get energy, you get cut off.
[00:44:30.528 --> 00:44:31.348]  It's military.
[00:44:31.388 --> 00:44:32.489]  It's called siege.
[00:44:32.869 --> 00:44:35.190]  And obviously those security guys don't know that.
[00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:38.331]  Obviously they're not bad people on average.
[00:44:38.651 --> 00:44:42.352]  But they've been taught we're the enemy, so everything's fair game with us.
[00:44:42.812 --> 00:44:44.893]  Everything is not fair game.
[00:44:45.153 --> 00:44:46.374]  We're not here to be raped.
[00:44:46.734 --> 00:44:48.114]  We're not here to be pushed around.
[00:44:48.415 --> 00:44:49.655]  We're not here to be abused.
[00:44:49.895 --> 00:44:50.555]  We're done.
[00:44:50.595 --> 00:44:51.856]  We're not taking it anymore.
[00:44:53.502 --> 00:44:55.844]  Oh man, is there any live feed or is that it?
[00:44:55.884 --> 00:44:56.484]  Is it all gone?
[00:44:56.504 --> 00:44:59.086]  Has the live feed archived yet?
[00:45:00.167 --> 00:45:03.269]  So we can go back and show them the police and what happened when they grabbed the camera?
[00:45:04.009 --> 00:45:09.693]  Again, folks, I've checked the law, I've checked the federal court rulings, and they all know this too.
[00:45:10.354 --> 00:45:11.955]  They went up to the parking lot area,
[00:45:14.288 --> 00:45:18.171]  They could call it espionage if you went over that fence, but all of it's public.
[00:45:18.431 --> 00:45:21.773]  We're not doing it from an espionage perspective for some foreign power.
[00:45:21.793 --> 00:45:24.075]  We're doing it for the American people under the First Amendment.
[00:45:24.315 --> 00:45:27.457]  The truth is the NSA is run by the foreign banking cartel on record.
[00:45:27.737 --> 00:45:35.743]  They are the foreign power that took our money and built this cancerous criminal institution that is expanding and metastasizing right now.
[00:45:37.079 --> 00:45:37.820]  That's what happened.
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:39.361]  I'm putting all these people on notice.
[00:45:40.041 --> 00:45:46.006]  And so they always try to intimidate and arrested reporters, mainstream reporters, you name it, the last five years.
[00:45:46.366 --> 00:45:47.427]  Lawsuits were filed.
[00:45:47.707 --> 00:45:48.708]  The NSA lost.
[00:45:49.528 --> 00:45:58.976]  Because you can go up to a military base as a reporter and say, I want to talk to your public information officer or your public affairs officer.
[00:45:59.856 --> 00:46:04.640]  But they try to act like that is some freaky, horrible thing to do something like that.
[00:46:05.953 --> 00:46:07.534]  Photography is not a crime.
[00:46:07.574 --> 00:46:10.176]  They tried and charged him, but then he got thrown out of court.
[00:46:10.937 --> 00:46:14.899]  A resident of Illinois we had on last year was life in prison for videotaping police.
[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:20.984]  And you can see the NSA Center back there about 400 yards away, just the edge of it over that hill.
[00:46:22.785 --> 00:46:27.569]  And, you know, here are the guys getting out of their vehicle, all on a power trip because they work for the NSA.
[00:46:27.889 --> 00:46:31.391]  It's shameful that you work for the Foreign Occupational Bank System.
[00:46:31.992 --> 00:46:33.073]  It's shameful!
[00:46:33.673 --> 00:46:34.654]  It's shameful!
[00:46:35.842 --> 00:46:39.505]  It's shameful that you're part of the fake, illegal shadow government.
[00:46:40.486 --> 00:46:41.787]  It's absolutely shameful.
[00:46:42.207 --> 00:46:44.829]  And the sleeping giant that is America is awakening.
[00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:59.441]  And more and more, we the people, other reporters, other newspaper reporters, just four or five years ago, they had San Antonio Express News and other San Antonio papers, I forget the name of their weekly, go out to the NSA Center they were building right by a Walmart.
[00:46:59.841 --> 00:47:01.262]  It's about a third the size of this one.
[00:47:01.282 --> 00:47:04.005]  It's the size of five or six big football fields, just the buildings.
[00:47:05.217 --> 00:47:09.398]  And they came and arrested the reporter and took his film footage.
[00:47:10.419 --> 00:47:12.999]  And then later dropped their fake charges, because it's all fake.
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:15.780]  It's outrageous, folks.
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:24.323]  It came out now that people at prayer breakfasts with Obama that mildly criticized abortion were then audited and harassed under Obama's orders.
[00:47:24.783 --> 00:47:30.724]  The emperor, you go to a prayer breakfast, here it is, IRS audited Carson after prayer breakfast.
[00:47:31.025 --> 00:47:32.385]  That's up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:36.351]  We have Anthony on the phone.
[00:47:36.391 --> 00:47:37.191]  Anthony, what happened?
[00:47:37.231 --> 00:47:38.072]  Anthony Gucciardi?
[00:47:38.772 --> 00:47:41.554]  Listen, listen, they're not even letting me call you right now.
[00:47:41.574 --> 00:47:47.897]  They are telling us that we have to legally delete every single thing on our camera right now, or we cannot leave.
[00:47:48.017 --> 00:47:49.898]  Alright, well, would you want to talk to them about it?
[00:47:50.038 --> 00:47:52.860]  Yeah, that's total color of law, that's fraudulent, and they know it.
[00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:57.302]  They're saying we cannot leave unless we delete everything on the camera.
[00:47:57.342 --> 00:47:58.743]  Delete the scenes that we shot here.
[00:47:58.863 --> 00:48:02.045]  Yeah, tell them to state, tell them to state the authority under law.
[00:48:02.065 --> 00:48:04.066]  Please state the law which says we need to do that.
[00:48:06.849 --> 00:48:11.511]  He says CFR 228.03 and that's his federal property.
[00:48:11.551 --> 00:48:12.811]  If we don't delete it, we cannot leave.
[00:48:13.851 --> 00:48:15.552]  But you're in the parking area.
[00:48:16.272 --> 00:48:18.172]  Yeah, we're in the parking area of the NSA.
[00:48:20.113 --> 00:48:20.513]  Are we not?
[00:48:20.593 --> 00:48:21.633]  Are we in the parking area though?
[00:48:21.773 --> 00:48:22.074]  Yeah.
[00:48:22.394 --> 00:48:23.314]  So we are in the parking area.
[00:48:23.514 --> 00:48:28.215]  Ask him if Google has to delete their satellite photos.
[00:48:28.435 --> 00:48:29.136]  Put up the Google!
[00:48:29.396 --> 00:48:30.756]  We can zoom in anywhere.
[00:48:30.776 --> 00:48:32.617]  What about Google satellite photos and stuff?
[00:48:32.637 --> 00:48:33.497]  They have photos of everything.
[00:48:33.517 --> 00:48:34.157]  Do they have to delete it?
[00:48:35.257 --> 00:48:40.759]  Okay, so they're saying, okay, so they're saying since we took it on this property, we captured it or we can't waive it.
[00:48:40.979 --> 00:48:42.079]  They're going to keep us here until we do it.
[00:48:42.679 --> 00:48:43.140]  Am I right?
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:44.360]  Are you guys going to arrest us?
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:47.881]  Or, they're going to take all our equipment.
[00:48:47.921 --> 00:48:49.822]  They're going to take all our equipment out.
[00:48:50.022 --> 00:48:51.582]  Well, you need to tell him this.
[00:48:51.622 --> 00:48:52.282]  Let me talk to him.
[00:48:52.302 --> 00:48:55.143]  Here, would you please talk to Alex?
[00:48:55.503 --> 00:48:58.804]  Okay, he's not going to, he refuses to talk to you.
[00:48:58.844 --> 00:49:00.565]  Would you be willing to tell Alex the law?
[00:49:00.705 --> 00:49:01.645]  He just wants to know the law.
[00:49:01.905 --> 00:49:02.606]  What is his name?
[00:49:02.666 --> 00:49:03.286]  What is his name?
[00:49:05.457 --> 00:49:06.698]  What's your officer name?
[00:49:07.658 --> 00:49:09.559]  Justette T. Badge number 800.
[00:49:09.599 --> 00:49:11.600]  He's an NSA police officer.
[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:12.940]  And your badge name, sir?
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:13.761]  Sergeant Mimano.
[00:49:14.081 --> 00:49:14.961]  Sergeant Mimano.
[00:49:15.221 --> 00:49:19.763]  Badge number, please?
[00:49:20.043 --> 00:49:19.763]  784.
[00:49:20.323 --> 00:49:21.023]  And you, sir, please?
[00:49:21.483 --> 00:49:23.104]  We're just documenting this for records keeping.
[00:49:23.624 --> 00:49:24.425]  Lieutenant Bauman.
[00:49:24.485 --> 00:49:26.425]  Badge number, please?
[00:49:26.445 --> 00:49:26.425]  4.
[00:49:27.046 --> 00:49:27.426]  Just number 4.
[00:49:29.008 --> 00:49:30.229]  Okay, he's a lieutenant, he says.
[00:49:30.669 --> 00:49:34.552]  Um, so they're either gonna, they're saying that we cannot leave, they're gonna confiscate all of our equipment.
[00:49:34.573 --> 00:49:45.961]  Alright, well you tell him this, tell him this, tell him, tell him we're calling the network's legal counsel, and so, and so, uh, tell them that... Okay, we're just gonna call our legal counsel real quick, just to make sure.
[00:49:46.142 --> 00:49:46.502]  Okay?
[00:49:47.943 --> 00:49:48.844]  Now he wants me to hang up the phone.
[00:49:48.864 --> 00:49:55.129]  We're just calling the legal counsel, we're just gonna get him on the line, and we're gonna talk to him, because there appears to be a parking lot, but...
[00:49:55.869 --> 00:49:56.630]  All right, Alex.
[00:49:56.690 --> 00:49:59.191]  Anthony, you make the decision on what you feel is best.
[00:49:59.631 --> 00:50:04.854]  As long as they delete the stuff back before, it's obviously a violation of the First Amendment, and we'll have a court case.
[00:50:04.914 --> 00:50:07.596]  I don't wish to sue them, but it is important for the First Amendment.
[00:50:07.616 --> 00:50:08.596]  We'll probably be forced to.
[00:50:09.637 --> 00:50:17.541]  So I would tell you that even though these are probably, in my opinion, illegal orders, you are in a dangerous situation.
[00:50:17.561 --> 00:50:20.422]  Oh, yeah.
[00:50:20.883 --> 00:50:21.483]  Oh, yeah.
[00:50:21.723 --> 00:50:24.905]  Let's talk about that specifically at a later time.
[00:50:26.283 --> 00:50:27.104]  Give me the U.S.
[00:50:27.144 --> 00:50:28.285]  code that he's giving you.
[00:50:28.545 --> 00:50:29.085]  One more time.
[00:50:29.486 --> 00:50:34.569]  Please provide the code one more time for why you need to confiscate all of our equipment and delete it or arrest us.
[00:50:34.609 --> 00:50:35.850]  Can you provide the code one more time?
[00:50:37.471 --> 00:50:38.031]  Excuse me, sir.
[00:50:38.051 --> 00:50:39.372]  Can you give me that code one more time?
[00:50:39.532 --> 00:50:40.953]  They're not letting us to walk away.
[00:50:41.093 --> 00:50:42.114]  Can you give us that code?
[00:50:42.134 --> 00:50:44.936]  CFR 228 point what?
[00:50:45.757 --> 00:50:46.837]  Zero three.
[00:50:46.877 --> 00:50:52.121]  CFR 228.03 says under that code we have to provide every single thing that we took here and delete it.
[00:50:53.416 --> 00:50:54.877]  Say that again, that's what law?
[00:50:54.997 --> 00:50:58.660]  It says we're trespassing on CFR 228.03.
[00:50:59.921 --> 00:51:01.583]  Oh no, no, that's trespassing.
[00:51:01.603 --> 00:51:02.984]  He has to tell you to go.
[00:51:03.344 --> 00:51:07.107]  So he's, no, no, no, telling you are going since he told you to... We're leaving.
[00:51:07.728 --> 00:51:10.470]  What does that have to do with taking all the cameras and stuff?
[00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:12.371]  Tell him I comply with your trespassing order.
[00:51:20.424 --> 00:51:21.245]  We're leaving.
[00:51:21.265 --> 00:51:21.806]  We're leaving.
[00:51:21.826 --> 00:51:22.346]  Yep, that's it.
[00:51:22.366 --> 00:51:23.407]  So you heard him.
[00:51:23.568 --> 00:51:24.809]  You need to leave, but you can't leave.
[00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:27.412]  So he's going to get a serious civil rights lawsuit with that type of talk.
[00:51:41.573 --> 00:51:42.713]  We don't have a problem with that.
[00:51:42.813 --> 00:51:46.335]  We're wondering why, under that law, why do we have to delete everything we took?
[00:51:46.795 --> 00:51:48.596]  Where does it say that in the law?
[00:51:48.736 --> 00:51:53.297]  Okay, everything from here, why?
[00:51:53.497 --> 00:51:57.239]  The sign says we can't do it, so we have to do it.
[00:51:57.319 --> 00:52:01.040]  The sign says we're not allowed to film or anything.
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:02.321]  That's now the Constitution.
[00:52:02.541 --> 00:52:04.221]  The sign is now the Constitution.
[00:52:04.241 --> 00:52:04.862]  Let me talk to him.
[00:52:13.127 --> 00:52:14.969]  Just tell them the code.
[00:52:15.089 --> 00:52:16.330]  They're all refusing to talk to you.
[00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:17.371]  They know who we are.
[00:52:17.471 --> 00:52:19.773]  Is it public law, or did he say CFR?
[00:52:20.533 --> 00:52:21.494]  Did he say CFR?
[00:52:22.515 --> 00:52:23.576]  CFR, yeah, correct.
[00:52:24.757 --> 00:52:26.018]  Code of Federal Regulations.
[00:52:26.038 --> 00:52:27.999]  Since we're trespassing... Here, I'll do it.
[00:52:28.059 --> 00:52:29.040]  He won't say that, actually.
[00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:29.701]  He says we need to delete it.
[00:52:29.721 --> 00:52:30.902]  He's just saying you're trespassing.
[00:52:30.962 --> 00:52:32.803]  Now we need to collect everything, delete everything.
[00:52:33.204 --> 00:52:33.764]  Yeah, no, no.
[00:52:34.164 --> 00:52:38.208]  Telling you to leave, telling you to leave is not a power to erase your property.
[00:52:41.018 --> 00:52:43.639]  Yeah, what gives you the power to erase the property under that law?
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:49.201]  Well, just because we're on restricted property, why does it mean we have to delete everything?
[00:52:49.241 --> 00:52:51.202]  Our cameras are confiscated.
[00:52:51.262 --> 00:52:52.002]  I just don't get it.
[00:52:52.062 --> 00:52:52.842]  It doesn't make sense to me.
[00:52:57.244 --> 00:52:58.824]  Listen, you guys put in the wrong code.
[00:52:58.864 --> 00:52:59.524]  That's not it.
[00:52:59.664 --> 00:52:59.865]  It's CFR 22803.
[00:53:05.486 --> 00:53:08.307]  I don't even see that there, and plus I've studied this law before.
[00:53:08.667 --> 00:53:12.329]  You're in a public commons area, I told you... Are they deleting the stuff right now?
[00:53:13.609 --> 00:53:14.930]  They've got the cameras, they're deleting it.
[00:53:16.050 --> 00:53:17.051]  They're just deleting it right now.
[00:53:18.031 --> 00:53:19.852]  I mean, short of me literally taking it.
[00:53:20.912 --> 00:53:27.235]  Yeah, so they overpowered you outside of law, and are now deleting... They're deleting the stuff, they're deleting all the stuff right now.
[00:53:27.375 --> 00:53:29.856]  Doesn't matter, it's all been live fed out anyways.
[00:53:30.885 --> 00:53:33.106]  They're deleting all the stuff right now.
[00:53:33.126 --> 00:53:36.887]  They just picked up the camera and started deleting it.
[00:53:37.668 --> 00:53:38.328]  Trying to anyway.
[00:53:38.348 --> 00:53:39.368]  Trying to find it.
[00:53:39.909 --> 00:53:44.250]  Yeah, obviously, Anthony, don't say this in front of them, but don't remove the cards out of the camera.
[00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:44.791]  You know what I mean?
[00:53:44.811 --> 00:53:47.432]  Yes, of course.
[00:53:47.872 --> 00:53:49.493]  These dumbasses will not even know that.
[00:53:50.013 --> 00:53:50.613]  Anyways.
[00:53:52.954 --> 00:53:56.656]  Well, I think we need legal counsel on this issue.
[00:53:58.407 --> 00:53:59.568]  Well, listen, listen.
[00:53:59.608 --> 00:54:05.912]  They've already, in a piratical way, seized your equipment outside of law from the research I've done.
[00:54:05.932 --> 00:54:10.735]  And you need to leave and say, we're trying to leave.
[00:54:11.875 --> 00:54:12.896]  We are trying to leave.
[00:54:12.936 --> 00:54:14.157]  We literally cannot leave.
[00:54:14.177 --> 00:54:15.277]  They will not let us leave.
[00:54:15.838 --> 00:54:16.678]  Yeah, that's what they do.
[00:54:16.718 --> 00:54:18.439]  We will be arrested if we leave.
[00:54:21.321 --> 00:54:22.062]  We're good to go?
[00:54:22.602 --> 00:54:23.122]  We're good to go?
[00:54:23.462 --> 00:54:25.264]  Okay, we're good?
[00:54:26.344 --> 00:54:27.085]  Okay, get out of there.
[00:54:28.277 --> 00:54:29.178]  Get out of there right now.
[00:54:29.198 --> 00:54:30.479]  Alright, we're leaving right now.
[00:54:30.619 --> 00:54:35.885]  And they're probably, they're undoubtedly watching inside right now, but that'll take the bureaucracy time to figure that out.
[00:54:36.245 --> 00:54:39.308]  Get out of there and do not remove the cards out of the camera.
[00:54:39.328 --> 00:54:40.790]  Alright, listen.
[00:54:41.851 --> 00:54:42.111]  John.
[00:54:44.053 --> 00:54:45.235]  Sorry, Alex.
[00:54:45.675 --> 00:54:46.456]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:47.901 --> 00:54:48.381]  Alright, listen.
[00:54:48.502 --> 00:54:51.023]  They're listening very closely to what we're saying right now.
[00:54:51.644 --> 00:54:52.204]  We're in the car.
[00:54:53.085 --> 00:54:56.948]  We were able to get all of the camera stuff, everything, and maintain it.
[00:54:57.348 --> 00:54:58.809]  And we have all the footage.
[00:55:00.271 --> 00:55:01.471]  Alright, get out of there!
[00:55:01.511 --> 00:55:01.952]  Get out of there!
[00:55:02.132 --> 00:55:02.592]  Get out of there!
[00:55:02.632 --> 00:55:03.933]  We're getting out of here, dude.
[00:55:03.993 --> 00:55:06.515]  But listen, they're freaking calling in more people.
[00:55:07.156 --> 00:55:08.357]  They are gonna get us.
[00:55:10.131 --> 00:55:11.631]  Well, that's how the battle's joined.
[00:55:11.852 --> 00:55:12.652]  That's our plan.
[00:55:12.692 --> 00:55:14.012]  It's called the Alamo, baby.
[00:55:14.052 --> 00:55:15.473]  What do you think, we're stupid?
[00:55:15.553 --> 00:55:17.993]  Listen, listen, these people are defeated, man.
[00:55:18.053 --> 00:55:20.634]  They could not even, they didn't even know what to do.
[00:55:20.654 --> 00:55:22.175]  They said, we have never experienced anything like this.
[00:55:22.195 --> 00:55:25.636]  They've never experienced a slave come before Mordor's gates.
[00:55:25.676 --> 00:55:26.536]  We did not bow.
[00:55:26.556 --> 00:55:28.897]  And they said, I said, we're going to go over to that office over there.
[00:55:28.957 --> 00:55:32.718]  And we spoke to Republic Affairs and they said, oh, that dog would have got you if you went over there.
[00:55:33.462 --> 00:55:35.545]  Oh, we're scared of their dog.
[00:55:35.565 --> 00:55:39.830]  We're so scared, that's why we went to the NSA Center.
[00:55:39.931 --> 00:55:44.677]  We got it though, when we first came here, the guy came out of the building and said, get out of here, get that camera down.
[00:55:44.717 --> 00:55:46.139]  We got it all on my screen.
[00:55:46.219 --> 00:55:47.981]  Okay, you're driving out of there right now, right?
[00:55:48.001 --> 00:55:49.042]  You're driving out of there right now.
[00:55:49.303 --> 00:55:51.325]  We're driving out of there right this very second.
[00:55:52.106 --> 00:55:53.607]  And they're making some phone calls.
[00:55:53.647 --> 00:55:56.590]  They got our information.
[00:55:56.810 --> 00:56:00.393]  We are freaking on the no-fly list, black list, red list, whatever you want to call it.
[00:56:00.453 --> 00:56:00.953]  No, you're not.
[00:56:01.053 --> 00:56:01.374]  No, you're not.
[00:56:01.414 --> 00:56:04.636]  Let's hope they do that because then the civil rights violation is a lot bigger.
[00:56:04.876 --> 00:56:10.140]  The only way we take America back is by showing Americans how to act.
[00:56:10.501 --> 00:56:12.222]  Showing them that we can stand up to Mordor.
[00:56:12.542 --> 00:56:14.324]  Showing them the illegal spying is going on.
[00:56:14.904 --> 00:56:17.647]  And I'll talk to you off air, obviously, but you guys are smart.
[00:56:18.067 --> 00:56:24.273]  Make copies of the footage, get it to secure parties we have in the sector, you know who that is, and then they won't stop us.
[00:56:24.333 --> 00:56:31.801]  Three copies, go procure other systems, copy it, and then secure it, and then hope they try to stop you at the airport when you're leaving.
[00:56:32.422 --> 00:56:33.302]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:56:33.342 --> 00:56:33.643]  They might.
[00:56:33.663 --> 00:56:34.984]  They're making some phone calls right now.
[00:56:35.024 --> 00:56:35.865]  They're not very happy.
[00:56:35.925 --> 00:56:36.866]  They're just amazed
[00:56:37.950 --> 00:56:39.151]  Have you rolled out already?
[00:56:39.171 --> 00:56:42.232]  Are you out of their, uh, their, uh, foreign jurisdiction?
[00:56:42.552 --> 00:56:43.192]  What happened, Josh?
[00:56:43.873 --> 00:56:44.433]  Okay, we're good.
[00:56:44.473 --> 00:56:49.095]  Yeah, we're leaving, uh, the entryway right now where all the signs say you can't come or you're a criminal.
[00:56:49.635 --> 00:56:55.838]  So we're going back onto the, the public property because apparently, uh, the parking lot is not, is, is, uh,
[00:56:56.078 --> 00:56:57.039]  Listen, I've already checked it.
[00:56:57.059 --> 00:56:58.261]  So has the Associated Press.
[00:56:58.581 --> 00:57:01.344]  The receiving areas, those signs are fraudulent.
[00:57:01.665 --> 00:57:02.286]  They know that.
[00:57:02.746 --> 00:57:05.329]  They know you can pull up and ask for their public information person.
[00:57:05.610 --> 00:57:12.177]  But again, they act like you're bad to want to know about the big, giant group of criminals in Congress and in D.C.
[00:57:12.198 --> 00:57:13.119]  that set this up.
[00:57:13.639 --> 00:57:15.740]  Well, they didn't even know how to delete the stuff.
[00:57:16.261 --> 00:57:19.383]  They had no idea what they were even doing.
[00:57:19.463 --> 00:57:22.845]  Listen, they don't even want the minions thinking that it's illegal.
[00:57:23.005 --> 00:57:24.366]  Because those cops aren't criminals.
[00:57:24.566 --> 00:57:25.346]  They're just ignorant.
[00:57:25.666 --> 00:57:26.687]  So just get out of there.
[00:57:26.747 --> 00:57:28.108]  Get out of there immediately.
[00:57:29.048 --> 00:57:30.649]  Yeah, we're getting out of here right now.
[00:57:30.669 --> 00:57:32.591]  We're going to go secure all this stuff.
[00:57:32.611 --> 00:57:36.873]  I mean, this is just absolute... This is a complete takeover.
[00:57:36.913 --> 00:57:38.274]  There's just no rights left.
[00:57:38.334 --> 00:57:39.655]  I said, well, what about the first amendment?
[00:57:39.675 --> 00:57:41.356]  They said, the sign says no footage.
[00:57:42.755 --> 00:57:44.216]  There's no, no constitution.
[00:57:44.236 --> 00:57:46.657]  The fine at the NSA overrides the constitution.
[00:57:46.937 --> 00:57:48.237]  Well, that's just like they tell kids.
[00:57:48.277 --> 00:57:50.058]  They can't write about guns in a story.
[00:57:50.358 --> 00:57:52.159]  They can't write about their dad that's in the Marines.
[00:57:52.359 --> 00:57:54.420]  They can't show the symbol of a finger.
[00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:55.480]  There's no law.
[00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:56.340]  It's thought crime.
[00:57:56.700 --> 00:58:06.884]  They're just telling us the National Park Service is going around to stuff that isn't even federal property and shutting it down right now at Mount Vernon, you name it, because it's all a giant power grab.
[00:58:07.224 --> 00:58:10.846]  They need to keep us intimidated, keep us under their orders, Anthony.
[00:58:11.596 --> 00:58:16.138]  They've got big old lights on at the military camp now, even though it's broad daylight.
[00:58:16.458 --> 00:58:17.458]  Oh, they've gone on alert!
[00:58:17.498 --> 00:58:19.999]  That's because the enemy, the American people, showed up!
[00:58:20.659 --> 00:58:20.920]  The enemy!
[00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:22.180]  Why do you think people dare to show up?
[00:58:26.482 --> 00:58:27.502]  They probably got alert!
[00:58:27.682 --> 00:58:28.142]  Alert!
[00:58:28.322 --> 00:58:28.743]  Alert!
[00:58:29.063 --> 00:58:29.583]  Ooop!
[00:58:29.763 --> 00:58:30.163]  Ooop!
[00:58:30.243 --> 00:58:30.583]  Ooop!
[00:58:30.903 --> 00:58:31.424]  Alert!
[00:58:31.784 --> 00:58:32.744]  The press is here!
[00:58:32.884 --> 00:58:33.304]  Alert!
[00:58:33.324 --> 00:58:34.625]  They're still real reporters!
[00:58:35.025 --> 00:58:35.565]  Alert!
[00:58:35.885 --> 00:58:36.365]  Alert!
[00:58:36.425 --> 00:58:37.326]  Run for the hills!
[00:58:37.886 --> 00:58:40.067]  They're utilizing the First Amendment!
[00:58:40.839 --> 00:58:42.180]  It's like an anthill panicking.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:44.382]  We're gonna come back, second hour coming up.
[00:58:44.742 --> 00:58:48.525]  Info Wars at the Utah Big Brother Criminal Spy Center!
[00:58:51.187 --> 00:58:53.729]  The First Amendment dare rise from the grave.
[00:58:54.269 --> 00:58:55.830]  What if other media picks up on it?
[00:58:55.890 --> 00:58:58.853]  What if other people decide to march on the NSA?
[00:59:00.674 --> 00:59:05.518]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[00:59:06.158 --> 00:59:09.419]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[00:59:09.979 --> 00:59:12.861]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[00:59:13.401 --> 00:59:16.222]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[00:59:16.842 --> 00:59:22.864]  Supernatural Silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[00:59:23.465 --> 00:59:26.906]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[00:59:27.546 --> 00:59:38.248]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[00:59:38.949 --> 00:59:43.950]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically.
[00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:49.871]  To find out more information on how supernatural silver can help you win the war against deadly pathogens,

[01:00:03.246 --> 01:00:05.169]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:05.649 --> 01:00:08.432]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:14.977 --> 01:00:19.159]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:19.819 --> 01:00:20.619]  You want answers?
[01:00:21.399 --> 01:00:22.320]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:26.561]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:27.141 --> 01:00:31.203]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:52.011 --> 01:00:54.214]  If you just joined us, Anthony Gucciardi is on the line.
[01:00:54.234 --> 01:01:01.204]  He's going to tell us what happened behind the scenes just minutes ago when they took the cameras and turned off the live feed.
[01:01:02.486 --> 01:01:06.470]  Screaming at them, cussing at them, freaking out, making up laws.
[01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:07.771]  They're being followed right now.
[01:01:08.332 --> 01:01:10.354]  Go back to live feed, Anthony, as soon as you can.
[01:01:10.794 --> 01:01:11.635]  You're in Utah.
[01:01:12.456 --> 01:01:13.537]  Get to a good position.
[01:01:13.557 --> 01:01:15.819]  I would run to the media.
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.923]  I would run to a newspaper and tell them that the feds are after you.
[01:01:19.563 --> 01:01:21.665]  And run to the press like sanctuary.
[01:01:22.446 --> 01:01:23.867]  We need everybody to contact the press.
[01:01:24.228 --> 01:01:28.492]  I need Paul Watson, Steve Watson, Curt Nemo, whoever, to write articles about what just happened.
[01:01:28.792 --> 01:01:30.013]  This is breaking news.
[01:01:30.354 --> 01:01:35.259]  Reporters dare to go to the NSA Utah Center that no one else dare go to.
[01:01:36.687 --> 01:01:40.830]  Just to ask to a public information officer like we're North Korea and they flip out.
[01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:45.393]  Anthony, before they... Blame me, you're not out of the woods yet by a long shot.
[01:01:45.793 --> 01:01:47.515]  In our experience, they'll now make stuff up.
[01:01:47.815 --> 01:01:50.136]  But we're on record out in front of that.
[01:01:50.377 --> 01:01:51.898]  We know their psychology better than they.
[01:01:52.498 --> 01:01:56.281]  Tell me, reporting for InfoWars.com, what happened behind the scenes?
[01:01:57.230 --> 01:02:12.400]  So we get to the NSA Center, and we were going to go to the military portion of it where they have this massive tower and everything like that, but we went into the back road, and there was a bunch of signs, no footage, no filming and everything, and we said, well, you know, we just want to go and go in and see what's going on.
[01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:13.761]  So we went to the parking lot.
[01:02:13.781 --> 01:02:18.965]  We didn't even get, like, it was essentially behind enemy lines, but we didn't even go anywhere crazy.
[01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:26.850]  We were in the parking lot, and we were going up to this office, this first unmarked office, and we had the cameras going with the live stream that you can see that's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:28.190]  I think so.
[01:02:44.423 --> 01:02:47.084]  Remember, these are the people that spy on everything we do.
[01:02:47.644 --> 01:02:49.764]  And then you go to the gate.
[01:02:49.884 --> 01:02:50.484]  That's what that is.
[01:02:50.504 --> 01:02:51.324]  There's a parking lot.
[01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:53.485]  That is a gate over there.
[01:02:54.105 --> 01:02:54.785]  It's a gate!
[01:02:54.865 --> 01:02:56.525]  And they act like it's the end of the world.
[01:02:56.585 --> 01:02:58.406]  What a bunch of drama queens!
[01:02:58.686 --> 01:02:59.226]  Let's be clear.
[01:02:59.246 --> 01:02:59.966]  There was no gate.
[01:03:00.306 --> 01:03:01.046]  It was just a road.
[01:03:01.546 --> 01:03:02.067]  No, I know.
[01:03:02.987 --> 01:03:05.407]  I'm saying you went to the parking area outside the base.
[01:03:05.887 --> 01:03:08.688]  That building you wanted to go to is the gate.
[01:03:08.808 --> 01:03:09.228]  Exactly.
[01:03:09.889 --> 01:03:10.149]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:03:10.169 --> 01:03:11.470]  We didn't even go past the gate or anything.
[01:03:11.490 --> 01:03:12.250]  We didn't trust anybody.
[01:03:12.310 --> 01:03:13.770]  We just went to the parking lot.
[01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:19.312]  And, you know, Dave's followed us all day, so we figured, hey, let's just do a live stream and we'll ask them, we'll be friendly with them.
[01:03:19.352 --> 01:03:20.653]  We were actually pretty nice.
[01:03:20.693 --> 01:03:23.834]  We walked up to their office and he said, turn those cameras off right now!
[01:03:24.274 --> 01:03:26.855]  And then he just goes around and he calls back and he says, I need help.
[01:03:27.955 --> 01:03:28.996]  On his little radio.
[01:03:29.276 --> 01:03:34.639]  And then on top of our cars, he physically took Josh's camera and turned it off, took the phone, turned it off.
[01:03:34.959 --> 01:03:36.480]  He just confiscated all of them.
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:37.581]  I started turning them all off.
[01:03:37.881 --> 01:03:38.982]  And then I was talking to you on the phone.
[01:03:39.002 --> 01:03:40.122]  He said, give me that phone now!
[01:03:40.503 --> 01:03:41.943]  He just took it out and just turned it off.
[01:03:42.624 --> 01:03:47.627]  And then he gets all his buddies there and they're like, oh, I'm a lieutenant, NFA, officer.
[01:03:48.227 --> 01:03:50.348]  And they are like, give us your IDs right now.
[01:03:50.428 --> 01:03:51.409]  I said, are you going to arrest me?
[01:03:51.429 --> 01:03:51.689]  He's like,
[01:03:52.364 --> 01:03:52.844]  Maybe.
[01:03:53.324 --> 01:03:54.945]  And I said, well, we were just going to the office over there.
[01:03:54.965 --> 01:03:58.167]  He said, if you would have gone into that office, my dog would have got ya.
[01:03:58.687 --> 01:04:00.728]  And I said, well, what are you talking about?
[01:04:00.748 --> 01:04:02.649]  He's like, I got a canine in there.
[01:04:03.269 --> 01:04:06.510]  And I'm like, oh, so your dog would literally attack me if I went into the office?
[01:04:06.550 --> 01:04:07.771]  He's like, I'm not saying that.
[01:04:08.636 --> 01:04:12.600]  They just wanted to beat us up so bad.
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:16.022]  Don't worry, I'm really sad for their kids.
[01:04:16.463 --> 01:04:17.984]  Money on it statistically.
[01:04:18.445 --> 01:04:22.028]  One of those cops has got a kid at home that can't even talk because of the soft kill.
[01:04:22.728 --> 01:04:24.249]  And he's not man enough to admit.
[01:04:24.289 --> 01:04:25.531]  He'll watch this later and freak out.
[01:04:26.231 --> 01:04:29.394]  He's not man enough to admit that the globalist brain damaged his son or daughter.
[01:04:29.854 --> 01:04:30.575]  Probably a son.
[01:04:33.979 --> 01:04:35.241]  I know that because of the statistics, folks.
[01:04:35.261 --> 01:04:35.962]  Blood-brain barrier.
[01:04:36.002 --> 01:04:36.543]  It's not what I'm doing.
[01:04:36.563 --> 01:04:38.646]  I'm not doing the Johnny Carson, Karnak thing here.
[01:04:39.307 --> 01:04:40.929]  And they don't care.
[01:04:40.949 --> 01:04:43.973]  They will sacrifice their family on their petty power trips.
[01:04:43.993 --> 01:04:44.474]  You understand?
[01:04:44.754 --> 01:04:46.357]  It's about they're above us, Anthony.
[01:04:46.377 --> 01:04:46.978]  Do you understand that?
[01:04:47.619 --> 01:04:48.719]  No, of course I do.
[01:04:48.759 --> 01:04:50.420]  They know who we are, by the way.
[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:54.241]  They can come out and trash Anthony Gucciardi and beat him up.
[01:04:54.441 --> 01:04:55.581]  They're powerful.
[01:04:55.721 --> 01:04:56.421]  They're cool.
[01:04:56.441 --> 01:04:57.742]  They're the NSA.
[01:04:58.042 --> 01:05:00.983]  They kept saying we as if they are the NSA.
[01:05:01.063 --> 01:05:01.523]  We!
[01:05:01.563 --> 01:05:02.463]  This guy smiled up.
[01:05:02.523 --> 01:05:04.864]  He said, we do whatever.
[01:05:04.944 --> 01:05:07.365]  He kept saying we as if he was the NSA.
[01:05:07.405 --> 01:05:07.785]  Stay there.
[01:05:07.805 --> 01:05:08.005]  Stay there.

[01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:18.102]  I'm going to try to be as calm as I personally can be.
[01:08:42.102 --> 01:08:56.185]  Anthony Gucciardi, one of our affiliate reporters, he heads up StoryLeak.com, a couple days ago said, why don't we go to the NSA headquarters and show they're not shut down during the government shutdown?
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:03.103]  And I looked at him and I said, uh, yeah, if you want to do it, we've already been to the San Antonio one.
[01:09:03.483 --> 01:09:10.687]  They got signs up saying you can't film, but federal courts have ruled as long as you don't go through, you know, any lock gates or anything, it's first amendment.
[01:09:11.027 --> 01:09:12.248]  But I said, they'll still try to threaten you.
[01:09:12.288 --> 01:09:14.769]  I said, if you want to do it, he goes, well, let's go to the Utah one.
[01:09:15.550 --> 01:09:22.173]  So he and two of my crew members, Weldon Hanson and Josh went to Utah and they're live streaming right now.
[01:09:22.233 --> 01:09:22.954]  They just left.
[01:09:24.944 --> 01:09:28.026]  And they had police, NSA police.
[01:09:28.706 --> 01:09:32.047]  This is in the parking lot by the side of the road before you go on the base.
[01:09:32.948 --> 01:09:34.989]  Come up and get in their face.
[01:09:36.554 --> 01:09:43.941]  And grab their cameras, which is assault, take everything, and then they got in the car and drove off and they didn't even know how to delete it properly.
[01:09:44.321 --> 01:09:47.184]  In fact, you could hear the live feed trying to turn the video camera off.
[01:09:47.804 --> 01:09:49.646]  They're like, take the battery off.
[01:09:49.726 --> 01:09:51.007]  The guy goes, there isn't a battery.
[01:09:51.067 --> 01:09:56.793]  It was an iPhone on top of the larger, high-quality Canon camera that was shooting high-def.
[01:09:57.722 --> 01:10:00.344]  They're going to go back to the hotel for their own security.
[01:10:00.364 --> 01:10:07.269]  They're going to just upload the high-def footage to Prison Planet Live and to some of the other channels so nothing can stop us.
[01:10:08.169 --> 01:10:10.471]  And then it won't matter if they try to come after you.
[01:10:10.511 --> 01:10:19.337]  Now, when we've been to military bases before and just politely asked, like at Pittsburgh three years ago, the public information officer, they had regular army at the National Guard base.
[01:10:19.737 --> 01:10:20.438]  We called ahead.
[01:10:20.478 --> 01:10:21.359]  They said, just come to the gate.
[01:10:22.799 --> 01:10:25.320]  We have footage of it in my film, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:27.720]  Rob Dew and Jason Mermis and others pull up.
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:30.121]  They're very polite, like to talk to a public information officer.
[01:10:30.181 --> 01:10:31.241]  Here's his name, we're supposed to be here.
[01:10:31.761 --> 01:10:33.722]  They act all freaked out, because we're terrorists.
[01:10:33.742 --> 01:10:34.962]  I mean, there's never any real terrorists.
[01:10:35.142 --> 01:10:36.102]  Government runs Al-Qaeda.
[01:10:36.302 --> 01:10:37.843]  Government runs the drugs, everything else.
[01:10:38.303 --> 01:10:40.643]  So finally, someone's come, enemy Americans.
[01:10:42.104 --> 01:10:45.885]  As Homeland Security is in the news today, here's the headline, DHF's chief
[01:10:48.908 --> 01:10:51.469]  Government calls privacy groups terrorists.
[01:10:51.489 --> 01:10:52.150]  That's a quote.
[01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:54.311]  That's in Congress.
[01:10:54.371 --> 01:10:56.272]  So any freedom is terrorism, folks.
[01:10:56.872 --> 01:11:00.233]  And all of a sudden, the police come to their hotel.
[01:11:00.594 --> 01:11:01.814]  I'm up here at night working.
[01:11:02.835 --> 01:11:07.597]  The cops call my cell phone and go, your guys threatened to blow up the base.
[01:11:08.858 --> 01:11:09.878]  And I went, no, they didn't.
[01:11:09.898 --> 01:11:13.780]  I told them to go talk to the public information officer.
[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:14.820]  We've been calling them days before.
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:17.882]  And he goes, well, and I go, you know, we have footage of all that.
[01:11:18.635 --> 01:11:21.558]  He goes, oh, you do, uh, you better talk to the military.
[01:11:21.878 --> 01:11:24.640]  He calls him back two minutes later, he goes, nothing to worry about, Alex, we know who you are.
[01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:25.821]  Yeah, everything's fine.
[01:11:26.102 --> 01:11:30.585]  The cop called me to say, like, I was going to go, oh, yes, I'm a terrorist.
[01:11:30.946 --> 01:11:34.349]  These people are out of their gourds, folks.
[01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:36.951]  It's like play acting.
[01:11:37.291 --> 01:11:38.312]  Oh, look, it's the press.
[01:11:38.332 --> 01:11:39.133]  They're terrorists.
[01:11:39.453 --> 01:11:40.054]  Get them.
[01:11:40.954 --> 01:11:42.436]  They want to blow us up.
[01:11:43.837 --> 01:11:45.378]  So I want to warn my reporters.
[01:11:45.738 --> 01:11:52.344]  I don't know if they'll act like this in Utah, but in the case of Pittsburgh, and then they still arrested two days later.
[01:11:52.364 --> 01:11:54.005]  They're like, that's the one right there.
[01:11:54.045 --> 01:11:55.266]  He's like filming with all the press.
[01:11:55.546 --> 01:11:56.747]  They come and they pick him out.
[01:11:56.787 --> 01:12:01.531]  So they lost the lawsuit and take him to a center where they chained everyone down in the rain all night.
[01:12:02.351 --> 01:12:07.135]  And they did a bunch of other stuff to him that I've been asked not to mention, not to do, but to other people.
[01:12:08.598 --> 01:12:10.780]  I told part of it once and somebody got irritated.
[01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:12.101]  I mean, that's what they do.
[01:12:12.782 --> 01:12:13.763]  I know it's humiliating.
[01:12:13.823 --> 01:12:17.827]  I've been in juvenile before and, you know, had one of the jail guards try to have sex with me.
[01:12:17.867 --> 01:12:19.749]  I mean, this is why they get these jobs.
[01:12:20.530 --> 01:12:21.751]  I mean, it's what goes on.
[01:12:22.792 --> 01:12:25.935]  But one thing about this abuse is we have to say what they did.
[01:12:25.955 --> 01:12:30.900]  It's like if a woman gets raped, you've got to come out about it.
[01:12:31.874 --> 01:12:32.715]  And it's the same deal.
[01:12:32.755 --> 01:12:34.537]  We have to admit the government's abusing us.
[01:12:34.737 --> 01:12:39.441]  That's why they act like it's the end of the world if you come and try to film their big illegal center.
[01:12:39.662 --> 01:12:42.564]  Because remember, up until the mid-90s, I would get criticized.
[01:12:42.604 --> 01:12:45.427]  People would say there is no NSA, there is no Echelon.
[01:12:45.687 --> 01:12:47.990]  When James Bamford and others had gone public.
[01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:49.972]  And Wayne Madsen and others.
[01:12:50.372 --> 01:12:54.256]  And they just flip out like it's the end of the world.
[01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:56.871]  There's the footage, folks.
[01:12:56.911 --> 01:13:01.154]  They actually got the high def footage if you're watching us at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:13:01.174 --> 01:13:03.655]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:13:04.496 --> 01:13:19.426]  You can see the master feed of the radio show and their live feeds synced together or you can just go to InfoWars.com on the main page and we have InfoWars reporters at the NSA Center acting like we're a national security threat for being on the parking lot where the buses and stuff come in.
[01:13:19.446 --> 01:13:22.749]  It's a giant facility, you know, bigger than Mall of America on record.
[01:13:23.854 --> 01:13:32.977]  With them reading your emails, watching your webcam, harassing their girlfriends and wives, mainly spying on economic data to give it to select globalist corporations.
[01:13:32.997 --> 01:13:36.638]  I mean, they're just in there committing millions of crimes a day.
[01:13:36.678 --> 01:13:39.179]  In fact, it's billions, because every time they do it without a warrant, it's a crime.
[01:13:39.839 --> 01:13:41.840]  And now they've had Senator...
[01:13:44.755 --> 01:13:50.897]  Dianne Feinstein come out two days ago and admit in a hearing, because they always screw up and say classified stuff in public.
[01:13:50.937 --> 01:13:52.558]  That's what Dr. Bowman always talked about.
[01:13:52.858 --> 01:14:00.181]  The stuff he could admit about Star Wars and Black Manta and things were because the other people had blurted stuff out in congressional hearings.
[01:14:00.421 --> 01:14:02.201]  She goes, of course the whole backbone's tapped.
[01:14:02.261 --> 01:14:03.042]  Of course we're listening.
[01:14:03.282 --> 01:14:04.302]  That's on record.
[01:14:04.662 --> 01:14:06.183]  They're like, man, that's classified.
[01:14:06.423 --> 01:14:09.004]  They're listening to everything criminally.
[01:14:09.804 --> 01:14:23.755]  And they're building giant motherships to spy on us, to dial into their imperial probe droids, smart meters, and iPhones, and droids, and computers, and washers, and dryers, everything with microphones and cameras, watching and listening to you on record!
[01:14:24.795 --> 01:14:38.170]  And then you can go on Google Maps, you can sit outside the entrance there and videotape that parking lot and then the guard shack and the real entrance all day long, but they have to puff up and show up and act like, oh my gosh, national security!
[01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:40.072]  American citizens have shown up!
[01:14:40.112 --> 01:14:45.098]  No, no, it's dangerous to New World Order security that we're there shining light on you.
[01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:47.681]  And then the mystique is gone.
[01:14:47.721 --> 01:14:48.962]  Everybody's not afraid anymore.
[01:14:49.242 --> 01:14:51.463]  And hey, go ahead and crush me.
[01:14:52.144 --> 01:14:53.765]  You know I'm all the way in on this.
[01:14:54.425 --> 01:14:55.146]  I'm an American.
[01:14:55.206 --> 01:14:56.067]  I'll die an American.
[01:14:56.247 --> 01:14:58.888]  I'm a good person with honor and courage and duty.
[01:14:59.049 --> 01:15:00.209]  I do defend the republic.
[01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:02.811]  I am a soldier of the republic.
[01:15:02.831 --> 01:15:07.574]  110 percent, 18 years, 100 percent plus against the globalists.
[01:15:07.935 --> 01:15:08.595]  No fear.
[01:15:09.135 --> 01:15:10.857]  All these guys talk about no fear all day.
[01:15:10.877 --> 01:15:12.298]  It's a bunch of talk.
[01:15:13.118 --> 01:15:17.821]  It's not manly to go to a football game and get drunk and act powerful and bug your eyes out at people.
[01:15:18.321 --> 01:15:29.088]  It's manly to go expose the people raping our birthright of privacy and liberty and using the data against us on record to corner the economy and give it to offshore corporations.
[01:15:29.408 --> 01:15:30.589]  America is captured.
[01:15:31.569 --> 01:15:36.112]  And the sooner all these NSA people... Man, I told you about Barton Springs and I'm going back to Anthony and his live feed.
[01:15:36.952 --> 01:15:38.073]  Our reporters there on the ground.
[01:15:38.293 --> 01:15:39.034]  Pray for them, folks.
[01:15:40.953 --> 01:15:52.679]  I met Barton Springs about a month and a half ago, and there's these two women and their husbands, and they've all got criminal justice degrees, and they're talking about how they work for the state and they work for the city.
[01:15:52.699 --> 01:15:54.280]  It was two women, three men.
[01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:56.041]  No, three women, two men.
[01:15:56.581 --> 01:15:58.122]  And one of them asked about the husband.
[01:15:58.502 --> 01:15:59.743]  She goes, well, what's he going to do?
[01:15:59.763 --> 01:16:05.546]  He goes, well, he's going to the NSA center, or she said the data center in San Antonio.
[01:16:06.146 --> 01:16:07.247]  And I went, oh, the NSA?
[01:16:07.267 --> 01:16:09.208]  And they all looked at me like I was nobody and went.
[01:16:11.135 --> 01:16:13.997]  So, we're like, huh, look at you, you little nobody.
[01:16:15.358 --> 01:16:19.760]  And I looked at him and I said, listen, the Republic's rising again, and those are crimes being committed.
[01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:24.803]  And you better hope when we take the country back and we have Nuremberg trials, that you and your husband don't get arrested.
[01:16:25.303 --> 01:16:26.104]  Do you understand that?
[01:16:27.267 --> 01:16:31.670]  And one guy started trying to bow up a little bit, and I just stood up to all of them, and I didn't say anything.
[01:16:31.710 --> 01:16:36.772]  I'm like, you've been told what's going on, and they all, all those guys and their wives knew.
[01:16:37.473 --> 01:16:39.194]  They knew right there who I was.
[01:16:39.374 --> 01:16:40.835]  They knew right there they were cowards.
[01:16:41.075 --> 01:16:42.856]  They knew right there I wasn't scared of them.
[01:16:45.077 --> 01:16:48.019]  One of the guys a lot bigger than I am started bowing up, and I was like, I got up.
[01:16:49.679 --> 01:16:50.999]  I was about to say, come on!
[01:16:51.299 --> 01:16:52.600]  Come on, both of you!
[01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:54.940]  You don't got your badges and guns on right now!
[01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:57.780]  You punch me, I'll pull your arms out of your sockets!
[01:16:58.741 --> 01:17:00.141]  I'm sick of your crap!
[01:17:00.681 --> 01:17:02.441]  I'm sick of you raping my country!
[01:17:02.681 --> 01:17:04.482]  I'm sick of you shutting our country down!
[01:17:04.502 --> 01:17:07.862]  And I'm sick of you telling me how patriotic you are all day!
[01:17:08.622 --> 01:17:09.262]  Sick of you!
[01:17:09.663 --> 01:17:10.343]  I'm sick of it!
[01:17:10.883 --> 01:17:11.363]  Excuse me.
[01:17:12.543 --> 01:17:12.903]  Excuse me.
[01:17:13.983 --> 01:17:17.484]  I mean, folks, this is a normal response to being gang-raped by foreign banks.
[01:17:19.278 --> 01:17:25.941]  They come out and say, your washing machine has microphones in it, in a wired magazine, and I'm supposed to not get upset?
[01:17:26.741 --> 01:17:33.584]  By hearing a bunch of people getting off on how they're part of the in-club, spying on us illegally now?
[01:17:33.904 --> 01:17:34.805]  I'm sick of it!
[01:17:35.245 --> 01:17:36.326]  Get off my back!
[01:17:36.746 --> 01:17:38.386]  Stop acting like you're above the law!
[01:17:38.687 --> 01:17:40.187]  Stop acting like you're God!
[01:17:40.447 --> 01:17:41.648]  You make me want to throw up!
[01:17:42.188 --> 01:17:43.569]  Anthony, I'm sorry I got really angry.
[01:17:43.589 --> 01:17:44.690]  I was flashbacks to that.
[01:17:44.710 --> 01:17:49.152]  Uh, Anthony, tell us, tell us, tell us what you went through, what it was like.
[01:17:49.172 --> 01:17:49.933]  Get back to your point.
[01:17:50.873 --> 01:17:52.855]  Listen, this isn't a normal response to be upset.
[01:17:52.895 --> 01:17:54.135]  These people are crazy.
[01:17:54.175 --> 01:17:55.296]  Not even power tripping.
[01:17:55.356 --> 01:17:59.739]  They are megalomaniac insane droids of the Sauron system.
[01:18:00.099 --> 01:18:01.940]  What happened was... Yeah, that's why I got mad.
[01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:03.221]  Tell them what they did to you off air.
[01:18:03.421 --> 01:18:04.862]  Threatening you with dogs and stuff.
[01:18:05.558 --> 01:18:09.779]  Yeah, so we get into this parking lot, I mean, we didn't even, it's not like we came in broken.
[01:18:09.819 --> 01:18:11.979]  I mean, let me be clear, we're bulletproof here.
[01:18:12.379 --> 01:18:12.980]  We're bulletproof.
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:20.201]  We did everything perfectly fine within the actual law that they don't even know about, and they said, oh, we need to delete your stuff, and they didn't even know how to do it.
[01:18:20.221 --> 01:18:26.963]  They said we could, you know, we just left because we intimidated them by knowing the law and knowing our actual rights, so they were just afraid of us.
[01:18:27.303 --> 01:18:28.383]  But when we first got in there,
[01:18:28.983 --> 01:18:32.125]  We're just doing some live streaming, saying, hey, we're here, you know, in this parking lot.
[01:18:32.145 --> 01:18:34.167]  We're going to actually try and go into the data center.
[01:18:34.347 --> 01:18:35.528]  We didn't even think it was a big deal.
[01:18:35.548 --> 01:18:47.556]  We said, let's just go up to this building here, this unmarked, weird building with a bunch of suburbans around it and stuff, unmarked, and just see if we can talk to somebody about getting in, you know, see if we could actually get a response.
[01:18:47.836 --> 01:18:50.678]  Before that even happened, literally after I closed the door to the car,
[01:18:51.278 --> 01:18:57.646]  This guy comes out with a badge that says NFA, and he gets in his car, he peels out, like he puts petals in the metal.
[01:18:57.706 --> 01:19:00.149]  Actually, first he yells and he says, Get out of here!
[01:19:00.189 --> 01:19:01.170]  Get those cameras off!
[01:19:01.210 --> 01:19:01.851]  Turn those off!
[01:19:01.931 --> 01:19:02.291]  Now!
[01:19:02.431 --> 01:19:05.215]  That camera's only supposed to be watching you at home, scum!
[01:19:05.255 --> 01:19:06.015]  I own you!
[01:19:06.556 --> 01:19:07.356]  That's our job.
[01:19:07.416 --> 01:19:13.578]  So he gets in the car and he peels out and he drives over here as fast as he physically can and he jumps out of the car and he's like, turn those off now!
[01:19:13.978 --> 01:19:19.139]  And he starts screaming at us, telling us we can't film here and that the sign says so.
[01:19:19.519 --> 01:19:22.820]  So I say, hey, we're just here to ask some questions, you know, we just want to ask some questions.
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:26.321]  We don't even want any trouble because I'm trying to be nice and at least get further.
[01:19:26.361 --> 01:19:27.501]  You know, I thought we could get further.
[01:19:27.741 --> 01:19:29.021]  But he's just so insane.
[01:19:29.061 --> 01:19:31.582]  He says, I need help on this little radio.
[01:19:32.302 --> 01:19:42.613]  So a bunch of other unmarked huge cars come out full of SNSA agents or officers or something, and we start talking to him, and he says, I need all your cameras right now.
[01:19:42.653 --> 01:19:43.174]  Stay there!
[01:19:43.254 --> 01:19:43.654]  Stay there!
[01:19:43.694 --> 01:19:44.515]  We gotta go to break, Anthony.
[01:19:44.535 --> 01:19:46.057]  We're gonna come back to you and tell the rest of it.
[01:19:46.677 --> 01:19:47.278]  I didn't mean to flirt.
[01:19:47.338 --> 01:20:01.451]  I mean, if you'd have seen these women looking at me like I was scum and getting off on it and they're all arrogant because they're in the club that lives off me and then robs me of my privacy and they think they're the good guys, I'm sick of it!
[01:20:01.651 --> 01:20:06.915]  Your bosses run Al-Qaeda and the drugs and the little kids, okay?
[01:20:07.496 --> 01:20:08.597]  That's why I hate you!
[01:20:08.977 --> 01:20:09.498]  Wake up!

[01:23:39.306 --> 01:23:48.573]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:23:48.613 --> 01:23:49.354]  This capitalism?
[01:23:49.414 --> 01:23:55.518]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:23:55.578 --> 01:23:59.221]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:23:59.281 --> 01:24:00.202]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[01:24:10.450 --> 01:24:14.131]  Oh lordy, my troubles so hard.
[01:24:14.792 --> 01:24:18.673]  Oh lordy, my troubles so hard.
[01:24:19.153 --> 01:24:23.275]  Don't nobody know my troubles with God.
[01:24:23.575 --> 01:24:27.857]  Don't nobody know my troubles with God.
[01:24:28.217 --> 01:24:31.578]  Oh lordy, my troubles so hard.
[01:24:31.718 --> 01:24:32.498]  We're back live.
[01:24:33.378 --> 01:24:45.081]  Our reporters went to the NSA and I got really angry earlier because during the break they were telling me about threatening them with a police dog and saying we'll get you and all this other stuff and saying we can do whatever we want.
[01:24:45.121 --> 01:24:46.942]  Gucciardi hadn't got to that on air yet.
[01:24:46.962 --> 01:24:58.325]  I wanted to tell everything that happened and it just really freaks me out because I nicely just said to these cops and their wives that were also in law enforcement who were bragging about going to work for the NSA in San Antonio
[01:24:59.127 --> 01:25:00.187]  I just said, oh, the NSA?
[01:25:00.207 --> 01:25:02.448]  And they're like, huh, who are you, scum?
[01:25:03.229 --> 01:25:09.311]  And I just, that's why I don't like country clubs and people who think they're better than me, just because they're part of some clique and they're paid for by my money.
[01:25:09.912 --> 01:25:19.275]  And I saw some cop trying to run people off the road for fun yesterday, driving into work, just running up behind people for fun when he could get past them and then just doing it, messing with people.
[01:25:19.656 --> 01:25:25.078]  I mean, this is the essence of like living in North Korea or the worst areas of Mexico when it gets to me.
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:32.802]  And I don't know, maybe people don't have the spirit of liberty, but my family, both sides on the Mayflower, both sides, that's very rare.
[01:25:33.522 --> 01:25:35.783]  My family all over the Texas Revolutionary War.
[01:25:36.443 --> 01:25:38.524]  My family in the original Revolutionary War.
[01:25:39.224 --> 01:25:40.724]  All across the board, folks.
[01:25:40.744 --> 01:25:41.625]  I don't even get into it.
[01:25:42.065 --> 01:25:44.065]  I mean, everybody's got a little bit of history in their background.
[01:25:44.385 --> 01:25:49.327]  The point is, I literally, literally boil with anger when I think about this.
[01:25:49.387 --> 01:25:52.388]  But where is the instinct to not want to be trampled on?
[01:25:53.550 --> 01:25:56.092]  I mean, I guess we are a nation of slaves, what we put up with.
[01:25:56.292 --> 01:26:00.396]  What they put in the newspaper, they're watching kids at home over their laptops illegally.
[01:26:01.677 --> 01:26:07.181]  And it comes out it's happening from Missouri to California to Pennsylvania and nobody gets in trouble.
[01:26:07.201 --> 01:26:11.185]  I mean, when we first were talking about that a decade ago, people didn't believe us.
[01:26:12.206 --> 01:26:13.186]  Now it's just all over the news.
[01:26:13.226 --> 01:26:14.608]  Yeah, we watch kids at home, big deal.
[01:26:15.595 --> 01:26:17.696]  Yeah, Google's listening to you with the microphones, big deal.
[01:26:18.036 --> 01:26:20.458]  And then you go and say, hey, we want to talk to your public information officer.
[01:26:20.698 --> 01:26:21.918]  Hey, we got dogs!
[01:26:22.118 --> 01:26:22.939]  You shouldn't be here!
[01:26:22.979 --> 01:26:25.620]  Give me that camera!
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:28.342]  I mean, it's like, it's out of control!
[01:26:28.822 --> 01:26:30.123]  And they're there to intimidate us.
[01:26:30.143 --> 01:26:33.024]  Let's go back to Anthony Gucciardi with Weldon Henson and others.
[01:26:33.364 --> 01:26:36.506]  Anthony, tell folks, in a nutshell, how they were threatening you.
[01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:45.843]  Yeah, so the guy started screaming at us to turn our cameras off because we dared to go onto the NSA parking lot, which by the way is funded with taxpayer dollars and is actually our property.
[01:26:45.863 --> 01:26:56.347]  But anyway, so he comes out, he just squeals his tires, comes off, speeds over here, just demands to hand over the cameras as if we're just slaves and gonna bow to him, which is what gives him all of our property.
[01:26:56.387 --> 01:26:59.588]  He's like, give me those cameras, we're gonna turn those off, we're gonna delete all that footage.
[01:27:00.408 --> 01:27:02.169]  And we just said, no, I'm not going to do that.
[01:27:02.189 --> 01:27:02.930]  You know, tell us why.
[01:27:02.970 --> 01:27:05.611]  And I actually said, I wasn't even confrontational at first.
[01:27:05.671 --> 01:27:10.855]  I just said, hey, you know, we're just, we want to talk to your public affairs officer and talk to your commanding officer.
[01:27:10.895 --> 01:27:12.516]  We just want to go ahead and see what's going on here.
[01:27:12.536 --> 01:27:13.276]  We have a few questions.
[01:27:13.696 --> 01:27:16.798]  And he was like, no, I'm not saying nothing until you give me those cameras.
[01:27:17.078 --> 01:27:19.020]  So he turned the cameras off and everything like that.
[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:23.923]  And we had to tell him live stream, you can watch it, until he turned off the live stream and turned off the cameras.
[01:27:24.904 --> 01:27:30.686]  And what happened was, then I said, well, we want to know why there's underground bunkers in your NSA area.
[01:27:30.766 --> 01:27:34.167]  Why are there underground bunkers that obviously have ventilation shafts that are there?
[01:27:34.207 --> 01:27:39.389]  And Weldon Henson, who's former military, could say that he actually worked, you know, on some similar stuff, and he could tell them.
[01:27:39.689 --> 01:27:43.010]  And then we said, why is there a military outpost right there that actually connects with the NSA?
[01:27:43.870 --> 01:27:47.572]  And later, by the way, when it was on camera, he was like, oh no, that has nothing to do with the NSA.
[01:27:47.592 --> 01:27:51.434]  There's a literal road from the military base to the NSA.
[01:27:51.514 --> 01:27:52.135]  Oh, no, no, no.
[01:27:52.155 --> 01:27:54.416]  Listen, all they're going to do is lie to you because you're the enemy.
[01:27:54.556 --> 01:27:54.756]  Yeah.
[01:27:55.696 --> 01:27:55.836]  Yeah.
[01:27:55.877 --> 01:28:03.000]  So then what Bates does is he just goes over and takes Josh's, takes the iPhone, which we were streaming with, and just turns it off.
[01:28:03.921 --> 01:28:04.981]  And he's like, give me that.
[01:28:05.021 --> 01:28:05.662]  He just takes it.
[01:28:06.202 --> 01:28:07.443]  And we're like, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
[01:28:07.463 --> 01:28:08.363]  What are the laws for this?
[01:28:08.683 --> 01:28:11.585]  And before that, he got on his little radio and said, I need help.
[01:28:12.407 --> 01:28:25.916]  And, like, a bunch of unmarked cars came over, surveilling us from everywhere, and a bunch of dudes came out who were NSA officers, lieutenants, like, they use military rags now because they think they're cool and they think they're the NSA and they're the ones spying on people when they're nothing.
[01:28:26.376 --> 01:28:28.898]  And they come out and they say, give me those cameras, now!
[01:28:29.638 --> 01:28:36.543]  And they took the cameras, of course, they just grabbed it out of Josh's hands, turned off the livestream, turned off the cameras,
[01:28:37.384 --> 01:28:39.026]  We want to talk to your public defender.
[01:28:39.106 --> 01:28:39.747]  I don't care.
[01:28:39.787 --> 01:28:40.588]  Give me those cameras.
[01:28:40.628 --> 01:28:41.209]  I'm not paying.
[01:28:41.409 --> 01:28:43.171]  All you do is pay my check, boy!
[01:28:43.953 --> 01:28:44.934]  Yep, we gotta pay him.
[01:28:45.254 --> 01:28:49.917]  So they took the cameras, turned off all the stuff, and then we're standing there, and I'm saying, you're not deleting the content.
[01:28:49.977 --> 01:28:51.458]  I'm not allowing you to delete the content.
[01:28:51.478 --> 01:28:52.099]  We will leave.
[01:28:52.239 --> 01:28:52.879]  We will leave.
[01:28:52.979 --> 01:28:53.740]  And he's like, no.
[01:28:54.100 --> 01:28:56.162]  It's illegal under CFR or whatever.
[01:28:56.182 --> 01:28:58.823]  And we called you live on air, and you looked it up.
[01:28:58.863 --> 01:29:00.104]  It's not even what it says at all.
[01:29:00.124 --> 01:29:00.705]  They have no idea.
[01:29:00.725 --> 01:29:02.966]  It's not even the right one you referenced, and he has no idea.
[01:29:02.986 --> 01:29:04.728]  So we just kept saying, that's not even true.
[01:29:04.768 --> 01:29:05.428]  You're lying to us.
[01:29:05.448 --> 01:29:06.609]  You're not telling us the truth.
[01:29:06.649 --> 01:29:07.770]  It's completely fake.
[01:29:08.230 --> 01:29:09.231]  And he was like, no, it's not.
[01:29:09.251 --> 01:29:09.851]  I know the law.
[01:29:09.891 --> 01:29:10.652]  I'm a lieutenant.
[01:29:12.193 --> 01:29:13.994]  I'll read your wife's email if I want!
[01:29:21.693 --> 01:29:23.254]  And then he's like, I got a dog.
[01:29:23.775 --> 01:29:26.597]  And I'm like, it was really almost funny.
[01:29:26.697 --> 01:29:28.818]  It was really almost funny how pathetic it was.
[01:29:28.838 --> 01:29:30.279]  And he's like, what do you mean you have a dog?
[01:29:30.299 --> 01:29:31.720]  I got a canine unit.
[01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:34.202]  He was going to eat you up if you went over there.
[01:29:34.222 --> 01:29:36.243]  And I'm like, what?
[01:29:36.503 --> 01:29:37.624]  It was hilarious.
[01:29:37.724 --> 01:29:39.866]  And then he's like, give me all your IDs.
[01:29:39.886 --> 01:29:43.669]  So I said, listen, I'll give you my ID if you just tell me why you need it.
[01:29:44.449 --> 01:29:47.370]  Stay there, stay there, stay there.
[01:29:47.410 --> 01:29:48.310]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:49.370]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.410 --> 01:29:50.390]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:50.410 --> 01:29:52.011]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.751 --> 01:30:15.655]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[01:30:16.256 --> 01:30:19.519]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[01:30:20.079 --> 01:30:22.962]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[01:30:23.502 --> 01:30:26.324]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[01:30:26.945 --> 01:30:32.970]  Supernatural Silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[01:30:33.571 --> 01:30:36.994]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[01:30:37.634 --> 01:30:48.344]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[01:30:49.045 --> 01:30:54.050]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically.
[01:30:54.551 --> 01:30:59.976]  To find out more information on how supernatural silver can help you win the war against deadly pathogens,
[01:31:00.256 --> 01:31:02.417]  Go to SupernaturalSilver.com.
[01:31:02.658 --> 01:31:04.879]  That's SupernaturalSilver.com.

[01:31:10.785 --> 01:31:15.888]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[01:31:16.248 --> 01:31:24.733]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[01:31:25.154 --> 01:31:32.438]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[01:31:32.978 --> 01:31:40.363]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[01:31:40.863 --> 01:31:44.264]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.

[01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:10.961]  Ben Swan here.
[01:32:11.201 --> 01:32:12.341]  We are winning.
[01:32:12.401 --> 01:32:19.625]  Alternative media is challenging and beating mainstream media, and it's imperative for the liberty movement to continue this momentum.
[01:32:20.105 --> 01:32:26.689]  However, independent media cannot win without the support of sponsors and advertisers like Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:32:27.129 --> 01:32:32.492]  For over 26 years, Diamond Gusset has been owned by patriots with products designed for patriots.
[01:32:32.992 --> 01:32:38.519]  When I put on a pair of Diamond Gusset jeans, I enjoy the quality, comfort, durability, and style.
[01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:41.844]  Most importantly, my wife really likes them as well.
[01:32:42.344 --> 01:32:49.533]  From the cotton to the last stitch, Diamond Gusset bucks the industry standard by producing a 100% all-American product.
[01:32:49.854 --> 01:32:51.276]  Another reason for my endorsement.

[01:33:11.787 --> 01:33:15.609]  I have come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass.
[01:33:20.054 --> 01:33:23.815]  Better watch it, I got a dog that'll eat you up, American!
[01:33:23.855 --> 01:33:29.677]  We gon' watch you, you ain't gon' even ask us questions, boy!
[01:33:47.418 --> 01:33:48.839]  You think this is a free country?
[01:33:49.660 --> 01:33:51.221]  You're gonna learn better, son.
[01:33:51.241 --> 01:33:53.183]  It's our time now.
[01:33:53.964 --> 01:33:54.724]  It's our country.
[01:33:55.345 --> 01:33:56.846]  We work for the New World Order.
[01:33:57.927 --> 01:34:00.489]  We're gonna teach you Americans respect, boy.
[01:34:00.529 --> 01:34:01.630]  We know everything about you.
[01:34:02.471 --> 01:34:04.993]  You're not about to point out what we're doing with that First Amendment.
[01:34:05.033 --> 01:34:07.015]  That First Amendment's going down just like that Second Amendment.
[01:34:08.076 --> 01:34:09.297]  You're gonna learn that, boy.
[01:34:09.337 --> 01:34:10.398]  You're gonna learn that good.
[01:34:10.418 --> 01:34:13.721]  By the way, we have the real Rowdy Piper, who, by the way, is a listener.
[01:34:15.057 --> 01:34:16.117]  Saying that on air here.
[01:34:16.318 --> 01:34:18.338]  And I'm not bragging, I'm going to go back to Gucci Arty in a minute.
[01:34:19.039 --> 01:34:27.923]  Talking to Pachinik on and off air, it turns out, we have an article out on Infowars.com today about it, that Tom Clancy watched my films and listened to the show.
[01:34:28.983 --> 01:34:42.749]  And that for 12 years since I first knew Pachinik, since 2002, that even before I knew Pachinik, because Pachinik reached out to us if I remember correctly, he and Tom Clancy would sit around talking about stuff that was on the show.
[01:34:44.329 --> 01:34:54.897]  And then I think about how I got contacted by the assistant of Kurt Vonnegut, and then sure enough he sent me some art corresponding with him, got to talk to him on the phone a couple times.
[01:34:55.517 --> 01:35:01.762]  There's all these other famous people I've never got to tell you about, even more famous than Kurt Vonnegut, who don't want their names on air.
[01:35:03.523 --> 01:35:11.389]  But I'm not bragging, I'm just telling you, I haven't realized how big this broadcast is, and how long it's been big.
[01:35:12.133 --> 01:35:14.155]  And how fast it's exponentially growing.
[01:35:15.296 --> 01:35:16.857]  And it's not because I'm even that good.
[01:35:16.877 --> 01:35:19.820]  It's that I'm willing to say what other people won't say.
[01:35:20.260 --> 01:35:22.742]  I'm willing to talk about what other people won't talk about.
[01:35:22.782 --> 01:35:25.044]  I'm able to build where other people won't build.
[01:35:25.645 --> 01:35:30.509]  Because I have just fundamentally been so upset about the globalist collectivization for 20 years.
[01:35:31.349 --> 01:35:36.414]  20 years ago, I woke up when I was about 19 years old.
[01:35:36.454 --> 01:35:37.034]  I'm 39, about to be 40.
[01:35:39.188 --> 01:35:45.810]  And I found that they were taking farmers' property for no reason and giving it to rich banks to build on, saying it was for environmental reasons.
[01:35:45.870 --> 01:35:47.651]  I learned about them taking people's guns.
[01:35:47.691 --> 01:35:48.531]  I learned about U.N.
[01:35:48.571 --> 01:35:51.492]  brainwashing in the schools, because my cousin was part of it.
[01:35:52.692 --> 01:35:54.673]  I learned about, and I knew it was authoritarianism.
[01:35:54.713 --> 01:35:56.333]  I'd studied history, so I thought, I've got to fight this.
[01:35:56.913 --> 01:36:01.415]  And in 18 years, being on air, we've been able to do this.
[01:36:01.515 --> 01:36:04.375]  And we're just now getting into our stride.
[01:36:04.395 --> 01:36:05.956]  We're just now entering our prime.
[01:36:06.949 --> 01:36:13.491]  And I do overheat like a race car engine and go up to 20,000 RPMs and blow my engine sometimes on air.
[01:36:14.051 --> 01:36:15.071]  And it's not an act, folks.
[01:36:15.111 --> 01:36:16.112]  People know that who know me.
[01:36:17.612 --> 01:36:20.173]  I'm a very calm, nice person, except when I focus on this stuff.
[01:36:20.213 --> 01:36:24.834]  And I do start flipping out, because, man, it's so real, the stuff I've seen.
[01:36:25.614 --> 01:36:26.635]  The things we've covered.
[01:36:26.995 --> 01:36:28.995]  And just, it's so frustrating.
[01:36:29.276 --> 01:36:30.556]  But then to also know that
[01:36:33.772 --> 01:36:36.515]  To know that we're routinely breaking huge news here on the air.
[01:36:36.675 --> 01:36:39.437]  The Drudge Report, DrudgeReport.com is carrying one of our stories today.
[01:36:39.858 --> 01:36:44.622]  I get to, you know, interface with the biggest website in the world, biggest news site in the world.
[01:36:45.863 --> 01:36:47.625]  I get to know Ron Paul.
[01:36:47.725 --> 01:36:49.206]  I get to know all of you out there.
[01:36:49.246 --> 01:36:54.631]  We get to know all these great activists like Anthony Gucciardi and so many others that are out there.
[01:36:55.111 --> 01:37:00.036]  And I get to learn about the power of free humanity and how effective we can be together.
[01:37:02.708 --> 01:37:09.913]  Yeah, Gucci already showing us the ticket that he was given by them about why they erased his material and they also gave him some other info.
[01:37:10.513 --> 01:37:11.514]  We're going to show that in a minute.
[01:37:11.554 --> 01:37:13.215]  By the way, we were on the NSA site earlier.
[01:37:13.635 --> 01:37:16.617]  It said if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.
[01:37:16.657 --> 01:37:17.498]  Can we show that again?
[01:37:17.798 --> 01:37:19.479]  I mean, that is such a joke.
[01:37:19.699 --> 01:37:20.800]  Well, what do they have to hide?
[01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:23.062]  If they have nothing to hide, they have nothing to fear.
[01:37:23.822 --> 01:37:25.623]  That's the Domestic Surveillance Directorate.
[01:37:26.064 --> 01:37:27.865]  Defending our nation, securing our citizens.
[01:37:29.267 --> 01:37:30.228]  Securing us in prisons.
[01:37:30.588 --> 01:37:31.709]  Promoting transparency.
[01:37:32.850 --> 01:37:33.430]  Your data.
[01:37:33.470 --> 01:37:34.992]  If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.
[01:37:36.573 --> 01:37:37.534]  Connecting the dots.
[01:37:37.734 --> 01:37:42.477]  You know, we've connected the dots that you're run by foreign banks and that you're waging economic warfare on us.
[01:37:42.657 --> 01:37:43.638]  And we've connected the dots.
[01:37:43.738 --> 01:37:48.122]  Even if you don't know how to delete footage on a camera and, you know, your average security personnel are like the average American.
[01:37:48.322 --> 01:37:49.623]  I bet those guys weren't dumb.
[01:37:49.983 --> 01:37:51.905]  They just knew all the football and baseball scores.
[01:37:53.166 --> 01:37:55.748]  And they know, you know, the measurements on their favorite model.
[01:37:56.761 --> 01:37:59.907]  And they know they're the boss, and the people bow to us, and that's what freedom is.
[01:38:00.689 --> 01:38:06.480]  Let's go back to Anthony Gucciardi, but my whole point is, America and the world is waking up right now.
[01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:08.564]  I am so honored.
[01:38:11.150 --> 01:38:16.054]  To be on air with you, and I know I don't do the best job sometimes, but we're real.
[01:38:16.554 --> 01:38:21.517]  We love freedom, and we're fearless because we understand the stakes are too high if we don't fight this.
[01:38:21.557 --> 01:38:22.357]  In fact, it's not true.
[01:38:22.377 --> 01:38:22.998]  I'm not fearless.
[01:38:23.318 --> 01:38:26.400]  I feel fearless, but then I realize why I have a fearless feeling.
[01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:32.684]  It's like if you're cornered, and the person isn't gonna let up, and it's you or them, it's not fearless.
[01:38:32.704 --> 01:38:33.805]  You just know what you gotta do.
[01:38:35.065 --> 01:38:35.966]  I guess I'm desperate.
[01:38:37.363 --> 01:38:42.325]  Who was the samurai, I have trouble pronouncing his name, who said, the way of the samurai is desperate?
[01:38:46.286 --> 01:38:47.567]  No, that's the Chinese.
[01:38:47.847 --> 01:38:52.868]  Sun Tzu is the Chinese war expert, the art of war, but that's close.
[01:38:53.429 --> 01:38:55.549]  No, it's the way of the samurai is desperate.
[01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:59.791]  Such a man cannot be killed by ten men or more, is the quote.
[01:39:00.816 --> 01:39:03.879]  You can pull it was like a famous, I think, Shogun that said that.
[01:39:04.580 --> 01:39:07.963]  And more and more in life, I realize that it's desperateness.
[01:39:08.023 --> 01:39:12.127]  It's in desperateness that we get out of the trance, that we get motivated, that we take action.
[01:39:12.408 --> 01:39:15.350]  It's in desperateness that we have our real power.
[01:39:15.951 --> 01:39:21.036]  But desperately fighting for liberty, throwing all of it on God and saying, I'm taking the step.
[01:39:21.296 --> 01:39:22.037]  God protect me.
[01:39:22.097 --> 01:39:22.738]  God guide me.
[01:39:22.778 --> 01:39:23.599]  That's where it's all at.
[01:39:24.670 --> 01:39:29.612]  Because I realize if their system comes in, if their system fully goes into place, it's already hellish.
[01:39:30.432 --> 01:39:37.115]  It is curtains for all of us and all those billions of innocent children that are alive now and coming.
[01:39:37.315 --> 01:39:40.016]  We cannot turn the world over to the worst people.
[01:39:40.096 --> 01:39:42.237]  And it's such a good feeling.
[01:39:42.277 --> 01:39:44.258]  It's such a commitment to do the right thing.
[01:39:46.451 --> 01:39:53.255]  To learn that we are influencing the Japanese government, since I mentioned that, the Syrian government, the Russian government, the U.S.
[01:39:53.295 --> 01:40:09.363]  government, the big banks, to learn that in the councils of government, they're looking at what I say and what I do, because they're so afraid themselves and so in the system, and so specialized and so compartmentalized, the world more and more comes here.
[01:40:10.784 --> 01:40:13.746]  That's what MSNBC calls me, is this dangerous profit.
[01:40:14.659 --> 01:40:19.943]  And it's just bizarre to see the enemy sees me as that, because they understand there's no real leadership against them.
[01:40:21.744 --> 01:40:29.049]  And it's really bizarre to know that of the whole pantheon of resistance, all the great people out there, that I'm one of the main figures of resistance.
[01:40:30.050 --> 01:40:31.911]  And that doesn't put me on a power trip.
[01:40:32.872 --> 01:40:33.733]  It's the opposite.
[01:40:34.453 --> 01:40:36.775]  It's the realization of the responsibility.
[01:40:38.496 --> 01:40:40.557]  People say, well then be more serious, be more focused.
[01:40:40.577 --> 01:40:40.938]  You know what?
[01:40:41.018 --> 01:40:42.479]  God will lead God and direct me.
[01:40:43.775 --> 01:40:44.535]  I'm just a man.
[01:40:44.855 --> 01:40:46.156]  My best works are dirty rags.
[01:40:46.236 --> 01:40:47.376]  I'm doing the best I can.
[01:40:48.417 --> 01:40:53.218]  I'm pushing my shelf every night till 10, 11, 12, working hard, getting up at 5.30 in the morning.
[01:40:53.298 --> 01:40:58.300]  I'm doing the best I can, but I just wanted to report to you, the enemy's never going to tell you how much power you've got.
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:01.381]  They're never going to tell us how effective we are, but they know.
[01:41:02.642 --> 01:41:03.562]  We have a chance.
[01:41:03.622 --> 01:41:04.683]  Humanity's waking up.
[01:41:04.963 --> 01:41:10.705]  If some ragtag guy from Texas, on his own, with the help of listeners, could
[01:41:12.381 --> 01:41:14.042]  Really give the enemy a run for their money.
[01:41:14.323 --> 01:41:25.952]  Think what you can do as a computer software engineer, or as a scientist, or as a police officer, or in the military, or a teacher, or a lawyer, or a stay-at-home mom, or an old man, or an old woman.
[01:41:26.092 --> 01:41:30.856]  All of you doing little things together lead to massive things if we just begin to move.
[01:41:31.576 --> 01:41:34.959]  With just a tiny bit of energy, we will defeat the globalists.
[01:41:35.159 --> 01:41:37.861]  That's why they're racing to put their total control grids in place.
[01:41:38.201 --> 01:41:39.682]  Anthony, you got five minutes on the floor.
[01:41:40.003 --> 01:41:41.704]  You're doing live feed at Infowars.com.
[01:41:41.944 --> 01:41:43.145]  You've been talking in the background there.
[01:41:43.545 --> 01:41:46.167]  Tell us, to finish up what they did to you, what happened.
[01:41:46.548 --> 01:41:49.110]  And by the grace of God, they're fumbling, bumbling.
[01:41:49.710 --> 01:41:51.691]  Doesn't even matter, we already have the live stream footage anyways.
[01:41:52.312 --> 01:41:54.694]  They couldn't even erase the footage off the cameras.
[01:41:55.407 --> 01:41:56.047]  They could not.
[01:41:56.167 --> 01:42:01.491]  And then we showed them that their law was a lie, that they were legally able to delete everything.
[01:42:01.511 --> 01:42:14.859]  And not only delete, they were talking about literally taking the cameras themselves and taking them back with them and just keeping them to save the footage, you know, to make sure we delete the footage.
[01:42:15.399 --> 01:42:17.600]  And we just kept saying, you don't have the authority to do that.
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:19.141]  You know, you don't have the authority for that.
[01:42:19.582 --> 01:42:20.562]  Show us the law.
[01:42:20.662 --> 01:42:21.623]  Show us everything.
[01:42:21.923 --> 01:42:22.663]  And they could not.
[01:42:22.723 --> 01:42:23.984]  They kept saying CFR or whatever.
[01:42:24.324 --> 01:42:25.105]  And that just isn't possible.
[01:42:26.255 --> 01:42:28.577]  What is this ticket they gave you?
[01:42:29.017 --> 01:42:34.400]  Yeah, so that's why I wanted to talk about a key point that I forgot to mention because there's so much insane tyranny going on with this whole thing.
[01:42:34.841 --> 01:42:37.222]  They gave us, they wrote up a police report on this.
[01:42:37.943 --> 01:42:39.984]  Actually, it's an NSA police report.
[01:42:40.705 --> 01:42:44.307]  At the top you can see here, it's a personal staff report, NSA police.
[01:42:44.727 --> 01:42:47.249]  They have all this stuff, they have all our identification and everything in it.
[01:42:48.283 --> 01:42:51.005]  And, uh, the badge number and the guy's name is here as well.
[01:42:51.526 --> 01:42:57.931]  But the reason they wrote us up, and this goes into the database by the way, they told me, I said, I said, what are you guys doing?
[01:42:57.951 --> 01:42:59.973]  They said, give us your IDs or we might arrest you.
[01:42:59.993 --> 01:43:01.874]  They didn't say we might arrest you, but they said, are you going to arrest us?
[01:43:02.135 --> 01:43:02.575]  Maybe.
[01:43:02.855 --> 01:43:03.796]  I got dogs.
[01:43:04.156 --> 01:43:05.177]  And they kept threatening us.
[01:43:05.538 --> 01:43:08.000]  And then basically I gave them my business card first.
[01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:09.060]  I said, here you go, take this.
[01:43:09.301 --> 01:43:10.502]  They wrote down my name and everything.
[01:43:10.902 --> 01:43:13.484]  And they put the reason as photography.
[01:43:13.944 --> 01:43:14.265]  Reason
[01:43:20.649 --> 01:43:27.953]  This is like King Kong giving a tiny rhesus monkey a ticket for being in the ape family or the monkey family.
[01:43:27.973 --> 01:43:35.838]  I mean these are the ultimate spies and you just go to their main gate wanting to talk to a public information person and they flip out.
[01:43:36.408 --> 01:43:39.671]  Well, get this, I said, well, hey, we just want to talk to the Public Information Office.
[01:43:40.012 --> 01:43:41.653]  And they said, oh, here you go.
[01:43:41.814 --> 01:43:44.096]  And he pulled it out of his, he had it in his, like, jacket.
[01:43:44.456 --> 01:43:45.137]  Or maybe his car.
[01:43:45.437 --> 01:43:49.962]  Pulled out this ridiculous, like, North Korea guide.
[01:43:50.002 --> 01:43:50.823]  I'm showing it right now.
[01:43:50.843 --> 01:43:52.144]  It's on InfoWars, the feed.
[01:43:52.585 --> 01:43:54.106]  NSA, National Security Agency.
[01:43:54.987 --> 01:43:56.227]  Saving lives.
[01:43:56.688 --> 01:43:57.268]  Saving lives.
[01:43:57.648 --> 01:44:03.770]  They have a DISC, National Security Agency B-Roll, and it says, Why National Security Agency is so important.
[01:44:04.210 --> 01:44:05.310]  And they said, Here you go.
[01:44:05.350 --> 01:44:06.390]  And they started laughing at me.
[01:44:06.430 --> 01:44:07.030]  Ha ha ha.
[01:44:07.050 --> 01:44:08.071]  This is what we're going to give them.
[01:44:08.451 --> 01:44:10.431]  Look, a little fingerprint scanner on there.
[01:44:11.172 --> 01:44:14.152]  Building upon our rich heritage of spying.
[01:44:14.172 --> 01:44:18.674]  I was going to say spying, but our rich heritage talks about how they're saving lives.
[01:44:18.714 --> 01:44:19.974]  And this is my personal favorite.
[01:44:20.700 --> 01:44:22.761]  There is a literal fingerprint scanner.
[01:44:22.881 --> 01:44:27.084]  It doesn't actually scan fingerprints, but it's a mimic of a fingerprint scanner on this guide.
[01:44:27.104 --> 01:44:28.565]  This insane guide.
[01:44:28.625 --> 01:44:29.305]  I'm going to keep it.
[01:44:29.325 --> 01:44:29.765]  You can have it.
[01:44:29.785 --> 01:44:30.826]  We'll bring it back to the studio.
[01:44:30.846 --> 01:44:34.688]  National Security Agency celebrating 60 years.
[01:44:35.429 --> 01:44:35.729]  Wow.
[01:44:36.669 --> 01:44:41.092]  60 years giving select intel to megacorporations to shut down the economy.
[01:44:41.112 --> 01:44:43.613]  60 years controlling narcotics trade.
[01:44:43.633 --> 01:44:51.837]  60 years destroying the family and making sure local police don't find out when we're flying little kids out to Saudi Arabia on C-130s.
[01:44:51.857 --> 01:44:53.218]  60 years of snuff films.
[01:44:53.238 --> 01:44:56.760]  60 years of pulling people's teeth out with pliers.
[01:44:56.780 --> 01:44:58.801]  60 years of running Al-Qaeda.
[01:45:00.011 --> 01:45:02.012]  They're succeeding in today's operations at the top.
[01:45:02.032 --> 01:45:03.112]  They're succeeding in all that.
[01:45:03.532 --> 01:45:05.873]  And they said over and over again, this has never happened before.
[01:45:05.913 --> 01:45:07.734]  They could not believe that we were challenging them.
[01:45:07.794 --> 01:45:08.154]  And guess what?
[01:45:08.174 --> 01:45:08.594]  We won.
[01:45:08.654 --> 01:45:09.355]  We got the footage.
[01:45:09.595 --> 01:45:10.755]  We're bulletproof legally.
[01:45:11.055 --> 01:45:13.476]  We have defeated them, and they're just a bunch of minions.
[01:45:13.516 --> 01:45:17.218]  But overall, they did identify with the NSA, like, here's our packet.
[01:45:17.558 --> 01:45:19.318]  We're succeeding in saving lives.
[01:45:19.539 --> 01:45:20.659]  They were just laughing at me.
[01:45:20.699 --> 01:45:21.899]  They know what they're doing.
[01:45:21.959 --> 01:45:25.181]  They literally thought it was a huge joke that they were giving me this packet, like,
[01:45:26.181 --> 01:45:28.665]  Yeah, go ahead and try and get in contact with the Public Affairs Office.
[01:45:28.705 --> 01:45:30.828]  It's probably shut down because the government shut down.
[01:45:30.848 --> 01:45:32.030]  I said, well, the NSA is still going.
[01:45:32.050 --> 01:45:33.432]  And they said, yeah, we are.
[01:45:33.452 --> 01:45:35.214]  Oh, yeah, we are.
[01:45:35.775 --> 01:45:36.516]  We're still going.
[01:45:37.438 --> 01:45:38.119]  They just love it.
[01:45:39.284 --> 01:45:42.627]  Well, the issue is it shows what a pathetic country we've become.
[01:45:43.407 --> 01:45:54.276]  That it's an act of supreme defiance and heroism to go to the front gate of the NSA and ask to speak to the public information officer and have them flip out.
[01:45:54.317 --> 01:45:55.097]  And we did find
[01:45:56.438 --> 01:46:03.902]  Uh, at GOGPO.gov 228.13, disturbances on protected property.
[01:46:03.922 --> 01:46:06.143]  And this is what's been defeated in federal court before.
[01:46:06.423 --> 01:46:10.505]  They're saying taking photos was a disturbance, but in federal court that's been thrown out.
[01:46:10.525 --> 01:46:11.626]  But this is what they were talking about.
[01:46:11.846 --> 01:46:12.626]  Let me read it on air.
[01:46:13.767 --> 01:46:23.892]  Any conduct which impedes, you just pulled up politely and asked to talk to their public information person at their front gate, or threatens the security, well they're threatening the security of our First Amendment.
[01:46:24.972 --> 01:46:26.534]  Listen, let me go further.
[01:46:26.554 --> 01:46:27.355]  Let me go further here.
[01:46:27.956 --> 01:46:32.782]  Any slave near the illegal spy center, again folks, they're hiding in the dark.
[01:46:32.802 --> 01:46:33.462]  Let me just read this to you.
[01:46:33.883 --> 01:46:42.413]  Any conduct which impedes or threatens the security of the protected property or any buildings or persons thereon of which disrupts the performance
[01:46:43.655 --> 01:46:53.926]  Official duties by agency employees, or which interferes with egress or egress of protected property, that's what they use on the anti-abortion people on the sidewalk, is prohibited.
[01:46:54.287 --> 01:46:59.473]  Also prohibited is any, and this is just their synopsis of the law, the law doesn't actually say this, any prohib...
[01:47:00.834 --> 01:47:03.457]  Prohibition is any disorderly conduct.
[01:47:03.517 --> 01:47:04.498]  You weren't being disorderly.
[01:47:05.098 --> 01:47:06.560]  See, that's how they try to use the clause.
[01:47:06.940 --> 01:47:09.763]  Any failure to obey an order to depart the premises.
[01:47:09.803 --> 01:47:16.270]  So this is really, as I could tell, he was trying to confuse you, telling you to go, but not letting you go.
[01:47:16.690 --> 01:47:19.633]  Wanting to then charge you with trespassing, but we said the key words.
[01:47:19.953 --> 01:47:20.894]  We agree to go.
[01:47:21.215 --> 01:47:22.236]  We're following that order.
[01:47:22.276 --> 01:47:23.237]  That's when they had to let you go.
[01:47:24.500 --> 01:47:39.155]  Any unwarranted loitering, any behavior which creates loud or unusual noises or nuisances, or any conduct which obstructs the usual use of entrances, foyers, lobbies, corridors, offices, elevators, stairways, or parking lots.
[01:47:39.175 --> 01:47:42.238]  Yeah, this is written for pro-life groups back in the 80s.
[01:47:42.979 --> 01:47:44.421]  And you didn't do any of that.
[01:47:44.481 --> 01:47:55.812]  You pulled up to the parking lot, to go to the main gate, to ask to talk to the press people, and they flipped out like North Koreans would, because what they're doing on record is illegal inside Anthony Gucciardi.
[01:47:56.798 --> 01:47:57.218]  Exactly.
[01:47:57.278 --> 01:48:00.201]  We, literally now, it's illegal to be in a parking lot.
[01:48:00.341 --> 01:48:01.982]  I mean, it's not even that we went past the gate.
[01:48:02.022 --> 01:48:07.707]  We were going to the office to ask for a public affairs officer, which is what I actually had planned to do, and ask him some questions.
[01:48:07.907 --> 01:48:14.112]  And they were threatening us with arrest, threatening us with the dogs attacking us and eating us, and just being in a parking lot.
[01:48:14.152 --> 01:48:15.313]  And they don't even know the law.
[01:48:15.633 --> 01:48:18.756]  And he kept saying, oh yeah, under that law, you have to give up all of your cameras.
[01:48:19.276 --> 01:48:21.237]  Not just, here, give them to me for a minute, even.
[01:48:21.257 --> 01:48:22.398]  It's not even that anymore.
[01:48:22.658 --> 01:48:25.179]  See, when they succeed, they push the ante.
[01:48:25.199 --> 01:48:30.342]  They've been able to confiscate cameras before, so now it's, we're not just going to confiscate them, we're going to take them back to the station.
[01:48:30.742 --> 01:48:32.923]  And then they're going to look at all the stuff you got and delete everything.
[01:48:32.943 --> 01:48:36.005]  Or, who knows, edit it, film it, make you look like you did something.
[01:48:36.385 --> 01:48:38.146]  And we said, hey, we're just shooting a bunch of B-roll, too.
[01:48:38.186 --> 01:48:39.267]  I mean, you can't delete all our stuff.
[01:48:39.287 --> 01:48:43.549]  And he said, anything taken within this premises is illegal.
[01:48:43.989 --> 01:48:44.970]  But it's not at all.
[01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:47.110]  It's just a complete lie.
[01:48:47.210 --> 01:48:49.571]  And they kept making up, and they said, you guys, just leave.
[01:48:49.671 --> 01:48:50.751]  And I said, well, OK, we'll leave.
[01:48:50.791 --> 01:48:51.171]  We'll go.
[01:48:51.191 --> 01:48:51.491]  No.
[01:48:51.512 --> 01:48:52.512]  Give us the cameras.
[01:48:52.612 --> 01:48:53.932]  And I said, well, OK.
[01:48:53.972 --> 01:48:54.932]  We're going to leave, though.
[01:48:54.952 --> 01:48:55.612]  We don't want to do that.
[01:48:55.632 --> 01:49:01.474]  And then at the end, finally, once we were on the phone with you live and everything, and they realized what we kept saying, it's on live stream.
[01:49:01.494 --> 01:49:02.394]  11 million people saw it.
[01:49:02.414 --> 01:49:03.154]  It's on live stream.
[01:49:03.334 --> 01:49:04.915]  It's on live stream over and over again.
[01:49:05.595 --> 01:49:09.136]  Then he was like, he was just like so mad.
[01:49:09.336 --> 01:49:11.936]  He was literally caressing his gun.
[01:49:12.176 --> 01:49:13.237]  Weldon, was he not?
[01:49:13.257 --> 01:49:14.237]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:49:16.206 --> 01:49:18.147]  Here, here, here, let's hear that from Weldon Henson.
[01:49:18.567 --> 01:49:21.048]  Threatened that a dog would eat you, caressing the gun.
[01:49:21.468 --> 01:49:28.610]  Let's, uh... A dog was gonna eat us, don't... Oh yeah, a dog was gonna get us, and then yeah, he would, uh... Yeah, but hand the phone to Weldon.
[01:49:28.630 --> 01:49:29.911]  I want to hear it directly from Weldon Henson.
[01:49:30.091 --> 01:49:31.071]  Yeah, yeah, hey Alex.
[01:49:32.051 --> 01:49:33.212]  Yeah, tell us what happened, buddy.
[01:49:34.211 --> 01:49:40.397]  Oh, well, literally, you know, they came out there and they didn't like us filming, so they confronted us, like Anthony told you earlier.
[01:49:40.457 --> 01:49:53.149]  I mean, I already had the streaming camera out, and man, this guy came out real quick and just started yelling, hey, you know, put that camera away, and we were like, hey, we're just trying to talk to somebody, and we didn't even get it.
[01:49:53.209 --> 01:49:56.733]  We were going to walk up to their building, you know, and try to get an interview, and
[01:49:57.413 --> 01:49:59.014]  And to talk to him, he didn't give us a chance.
[01:49:59.054 --> 01:50:05.178]  I mean, he jumped in his unmarked vehicle and just filled the tires out and got over there as quick as he could and turned the cameras off.
[01:50:05.218 --> 01:50:05.859]  We said no.
[01:50:05.879 --> 01:50:11.562]  And then he had to radio and get some more guys out there.
[01:50:12.203 --> 01:50:13.584]  Yeah, he said, I need help.
[01:50:13.604 --> 01:50:16.566]  What was the part caressing the gun?
[01:50:17.727 --> 01:50:20.468]  Well, obviously he was uncomfortable.
[01:50:20.508 --> 01:50:24.131]  I mean, this first guy that showed up was definitely your typical
[01:50:25.290 --> 01:50:26.771]  You know, roided out guy.
[01:50:26.791 --> 01:50:29.214]  I mean, he was yelling, very angry.
[01:50:29.234 --> 01:50:38.402]  I mean, the other guys were a little nicer, but you could tell he was just, man, if we could have done one wrong move, I bet he would have been real happy.
[01:50:39.343 --> 01:50:42.586]  Alright, hey guys, great job.
[01:50:42.666 --> 01:50:48.352]  Get in, upload all the footage to the YouTube channels, and then it won't matter if they try to grab you at the airport.
[01:50:48.612 --> 01:50:49.973]  But they're not going to do anything to you.
[01:50:50.928 --> 01:50:52.870]  Because they don't want to bring any attention on this.
[01:50:53.250 --> 01:51:02.058]  They do not want people knowing that there's still Americans left that would dare go to the steps of Mordor and knock on the Iron Gate behind which Thorin sees all.
[01:51:02.679 --> 01:51:03.720]  Cersei's flesh.
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:09.165]  We'll be right back with other news as the Homeland Security groups shut down all the memorials.
[01:51:10.365 --> 01:51:13.526]  In times of disaster, internet and mobile networks will go dark.
[01:51:13.746 --> 01:51:16.647]  A wealth of online information will be completely inaccessible.
[01:51:16.887 --> 01:51:26.751]  Now, imagine the most extensive survival and disaster preparedness library ever created, with information for every possible scenario, still available to you without online access.
[01:51:27.091 --> 01:51:28.351]  That's the Survival Key.
[01:51:28.551 --> 01:51:29.872]  Ben Franklin said it best.
[01:51:30.092 --> 01:51:32.412]  By failing to prepare, you're preparing to fail.

[01:53:09.372 --> 01:53:13.995]  Every time you eat a cooked food, your body responds by producing an increase in circulating white blood cells.
[01:53:14.336 --> 01:53:19.140]  This happens because nature designed us to eat food that is undamaged at the molecular level.
[01:53:19.640 --> 01:53:25.308]  When we heat food to normal cooking temperatures, we change the shape of the molecules into shapes the body cannot use.
[01:53:25.728 --> 01:53:28.512]  The body now looks at them as toxins and allergens.
[01:53:28.933 --> 01:53:36.523]  In an effort to protect itself from this irritant, the body intelligently increases the amount of circulating white blood cells to act as garbage collectors.
[01:53:36.943 --> 01:53:42.027]  White blood cells gobble up all the unusable damaged food particles to neutralize their cell damaging properties.
[01:53:42.367 --> 01:53:47.251]  This puts stress on your organs of elimination and your body is subject to cell damage and inflammation.
[01:53:47.731 --> 01:53:53.816]  If you'd like to start experiencing the benefits of undamaged protein in your diet, give One World Way a try.

[01:54:27.337 --> 01:54:30.298]  John the Revelator, put it in an elevator.
[01:54:30.338 --> 01:54:33.160]  Take him up to the highest high.
[01:54:33.180 --> 01:54:37.942]  Take him up to the top, where the mountains stop.
[01:54:37.982 --> 01:54:40.964]  Let him tell his book of lies.
[01:54:41.184 --> 01:54:45.546]  John the Revelator, he's your smooth operator.
[01:54:45.626 --> 01:54:48.008]  It's time we cut him down to size.
[01:54:54.082 --> 01:55:03.625]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:05.526 --> 01:55:07.226]  You know, John the Revelator told the truth.
[01:55:07.246 --> 01:55:09.487]  You can see everything he said now unfolding.
[01:55:12.088 --> 01:55:15.109]  Isn't that too bad for all those that deny there is a God?
[01:55:17.093 --> 01:55:18.414]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:18.834 --> 01:55:21.595]  By the way, look what we found here sent in through TIPS.
[01:55:21.675 --> 01:55:22.876]  I've actually seen this before.
[01:55:23.356 --> 01:55:25.377]  Unclassified for official use only.
[01:55:25.698 --> 01:55:26.558]  Highly restricted.
[01:55:26.578 --> 01:55:28.279]  This leaked a few years ago.
[01:55:29.039 --> 01:55:31.561]  Photographing the exterior of federal facilities.
[01:55:32.921 --> 01:55:37.284]  And it goes through that as long as someone hasn't passed through a prohibited controlled gate.
[01:55:38.203 --> 01:55:42.368]  And they have the law listed that they cannot take anybody's cameras or footage.
[01:55:42.928 --> 01:55:43.789]  And it's the same thing.
[01:55:43.829 --> 01:55:45.691]  And it even tells them in the U.S.
[01:55:45.711 --> 01:55:47.854]  Department of Homeland Security Federal Protective Services.
[01:55:48.174 --> 01:55:51.097]  And this came out when they started losing in federal court in 2010.
[01:55:51.518 --> 01:55:54.301]  You can see the date on that, where they lost all these court cases.
[01:55:55.572 --> 01:55:57.073]  I think one of them was like a million bucks.
[01:55:57.633 --> 01:55:59.814]  But look here where it tells him how to handle it.
[01:55:59.854 --> 01:56:10.920]  It says, because the initial interview was voluntary, PSO should not seize the camera or its contents and must be cautious not to give such orders to a photographer to erase the contents of the camera.
[01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:14.822]  As these constitutes a seizure or detention.
[01:56:14.882 --> 01:56:16.423]  Yeah, false imprisonment, felony.
[01:56:17.083 --> 01:56:22.986]  All contents or all contact with the public, including photographers, must be conducted in a professional and polite manner.
[01:56:23.326 --> 01:56:29.409]  PSO personnel should not be distracted from their duties by engaging in assessing the photographic effort.
[01:56:31.110 --> 01:56:32.771]  Posing or for taking a picture.
[01:56:34.056 --> 01:56:34.516]  There you go.
[01:56:35.236 --> 01:56:37.717]  And of course, this is the official cover-your-butt stuff.
[01:56:37.737 --> 01:56:38.697]  They harass everybody.
[01:56:39.538 --> 01:56:41.758]  You try to photograph the Brooklyn Bridge, they come up and harass you.
[01:56:41.778 --> 01:56:47.100]  But if you're actual Al-Qaeda, they give you heat-seeking missiles and then go murder as many Christians as you can immediately.
[01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:47.900]  That's what I mean.
[01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:49.040]  This is not our government.
[01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:50.941]  And the average guys don't know that.
[01:56:51.001 --> 01:56:51.801]  They're still ignorant.
[01:56:51.821 --> 01:56:52.701]  We're here to wake them up.
[01:56:53.041 --> 01:56:54.702]  Believe me, the whole NSA is going to be watching this.
[01:56:55.182 --> 01:56:56.662]  So I'm really targeting you.
[01:56:56.722 --> 01:56:57.703]  I'm being honest about it.
[01:56:57.943 --> 01:56:59.343]  I want you to become American again.
[01:56:59.363 --> 01:57:02.404]  I want you to get off your power trip and realize what's happening.
[01:57:03.732 --> 01:57:05.033]  You know, as I said, don't become an American.
[01:57:05.073 --> 01:57:06.374]  I should become American.
[01:57:07.255 --> 01:57:08.576]  That's when you truly are an American.
[01:57:08.596 --> 01:57:09.517]  When you're American.
[01:57:10.137 --> 01:57:10.818]  So, there you go.
[01:57:10.838 --> 01:57:12.139]  We'll get that in our article as well.
[01:57:12.179 --> 01:57:13.099]  They were clearly violating.
[01:57:13.119 --> 01:57:15.301]  And I checked all this while I let the reporters go.
[01:57:15.321 --> 01:57:17.102]  I mean, I already knew this.
[01:57:17.122 --> 01:57:19.704]  This had already come out in the news and I'm glad folks pointed it back out.
[01:57:21.045 --> 01:57:21.446]  I'm done!
[01:57:23.206 --> 01:57:25.507]  Two hours now of transmission without plugging anything.
[01:57:25.547 --> 01:57:35.891]  We fund ourselves with the books, the t-shirts, the videos, InfoWarsStore.com, the modified linseed weed that's so good for the thyroid on record, and it's got all the studies and the rest of it, and InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:57:36.272 --> 01:57:38.392]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:57:39.793 --> 01:57:45.642]  They shorted us 2,500 bottles of the additional we bought, and it got here on the truck.
[01:57:46.383 --> 01:57:47.765]  So I said we were sold out yesterday.
[01:57:47.785 --> 01:57:51.510]  A truck came and they go, oh, here was the rest, because we only sent you a certain amount.
[01:57:51.831 --> 01:57:54.735]  We have 2,500 bottles or so right now.
[01:57:54.835 --> 01:57:55.656]  It's not sold out.
[01:57:56.337 --> 01:57:56.857]  Doesn't matter.
[01:57:57.037 --> 01:57:58.058]  More is coming next week.
[01:57:58.098 --> 01:58:01.539]  They just manufactured it yesterday at the lab.
[01:58:01.899 --> 01:58:08.062]  This is the best nascent iodine, atomic iodine out there for protecting yourself from the radiological background noise that's out there.
[01:58:08.082 --> 01:58:08.702]  It's on record.
[01:58:09.303 --> 01:58:11.624]  And so good for, I mean, just amazing.

[01:58:13.645 --> 01:58:15.245]  Nascent atomic iodine.

[01:59:00.063 --> 01:59:05.647]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[01:59:05.848 --> 01:59:13.074]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:59:13.234 --> 01:59:16.496]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:59:16.596 --> 01:59:18.358]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:59:18.618 --> 01:59:23.182]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[01:59:23.262 --> 01:59:26.024]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[01:59:26.184 --> 01:59:31.968]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[01:59:32.149 --> 01:59:35.611]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[01:59:35.811 --> 01:59:40.875]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.

[01:59:44.298 --> 01:59:50.160]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.

[02:00:05.485 --> 02:00:08.266]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:14.881 --> 02:00:19.044]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:19.705 --> 02:00:20.525]  You want answers?
[02:00:21.306 --> 02:00:22.187]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:22.827 --> 02:00:26.450]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:27.031 --> 02:00:31.114]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:39.895 --> 02:00:40.616]  Alright, folks.
[02:00:41.076 --> 02:00:44.358]  I kind of went off the deep end today with this breaking news.
[02:00:44.879 --> 02:00:46.300]  I knew the guys were going to the NSA.
[02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:49.822]  I thought they would just say, here's the PIO and we're not going to talk to you.
[02:00:49.882 --> 02:00:52.324]  Instead, they flipped out.
[02:00:52.344 --> 02:00:56.687]  Because I guess that data center hadn't been visited a lot like Fort Meade or San Antonio.
[02:00:57.307 --> 02:01:01.310]  They haven't been taught about the First Amendment again, and this is still America, at least in some areas.
[02:01:01.770 --> 02:01:07.734]  But if you just joined us, quite a circus with the NSA illegally spying on everyone, and I personally am sick of it.
[02:01:09.036 --> 02:01:23.734]  I want to get your take as callers on the audio and the video if you're watching us on TV that you just saw and also on the government shutdown and barricades, the new name for barricades, feds try to shut down privately owned Mount Vernon.
[02:01:24.955 --> 02:01:26.918]  It's privately owned, administered by a private group.
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:29.100]  But the Feds shut it.
[02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:33.041]  And they also did that at the World War II memorial.
[02:01:33.821 --> 02:01:39.883]  As has now been confirmed by the Daily Caller yesterday, it too is not administered by the Feds, but is federal property.
[02:01:40.323 --> 02:01:45.504]  They are blockading federal property that there's no, in fact, spending extra money to do it.
[02:01:45.964 --> 02:01:48.605]  And the government has shut down, it's spread to beaches of Normandy.
[02:01:49.682 --> 02:01:53.123]  Even though technically they don't own it, they administer it, so they shut that.
[02:01:53.143 --> 02:01:53.844]  You can't go.
[02:01:54.244 --> 02:01:58.265]  Including groups of veterans that traveled over there to the memorial.
[02:01:58.806 --> 02:01:59.526]  You're not allowed in.
[02:02:00.146 --> 02:02:03.207]  And so they're posting guards to keep you and costing extra money.
[02:02:03.748 --> 02:02:05.989]  All part of just total contempt.
[02:02:06.289 --> 02:02:08.209]  The globalists hate the American people.
[02:02:08.650 --> 02:02:16.833]  And they've trained all these police and military to think love of America is dominating the American people and securing us by getting rid of our freedoms.
[02:02:16.913 --> 02:02:17.233]  No, no.
[02:02:17.413 --> 02:02:19.014]  We'll secure our liberties, okay?
[02:02:19.594 --> 02:02:19.934]  Thank you.
[02:02:21.216 --> 02:02:25.381]  So again, Obama deliberately blocked access to Veterans Memorials to make shutdown appear worse.
[02:02:25.401 --> 02:02:32.089]  And I'm going to go over government shutdown 36 facts that prove that almost everything is still running, unfortunately.
[02:02:33.613 --> 02:02:36.375]  And also, we've got a continued shutdown.
[02:02:36.435 --> 02:02:38.837]  Paralyzed politicians reveal just how close the U.S.
[02:02:38.877 --> 02:02:39.677]  government is to collapse.
[02:02:39.717 --> 02:02:43.220]  It's a MikeAdamsNaturalNews.com article that really breaks it down.
[02:02:43.320 --> 02:02:44.661]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:02:45.581 --> 02:02:50.305]  Morgan Stanley says the government of the United States is not going to default.
[02:02:50.325 --> 02:02:51.105]  Yeah, no kidding.
[02:02:51.305 --> 02:02:53.587]  It's all still, this is all just staged, folks.
[02:02:54.187 --> 02:02:56.169]  Kind of like for three months, they said that the U.S.
[02:02:56.189 --> 02:02:57.370]  debt had not gone up any.
[02:02:57.410 --> 02:02:59.231]  They just froze the level to get around the law.
[02:03:00.984 --> 02:03:09.934]  Folks, the globalists have hundreds of trillions of dollars in slush funds of drug money, child kidnapping money, all the things they run.
[02:03:09.994 --> 02:03:12.136]  I mean, this is a total criminal force.
[02:03:13.897 --> 02:03:17.759]  And you've got some people trying to block the absolute gutting of the country.
[02:03:18.119 --> 02:03:19.820]  And so they're just doing this fake shutdown.
[02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:21.680]  The welfare checks are going out.
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:22.521]  They're all going out.
[02:03:22.561 --> 02:03:23.361]  It's all happening.
[02:03:24.721 --> 02:03:30.544]  And they're trying to maneuver the country towards final collapse and consolidation to the technocracy.
[02:03:30.984 --> 02:03:36.266]  But they won't do that until they've got everybody dumbed down, families broken down, and at least half the people with cancer.
[02:03:37.186 --> 02:03:39.227]  And they're trying to hurry that up with the vaccines and things.
[02:03:39.267 --> 02:03:41.768]  They don't want to kill us too quick or we might notice, you see.
[02:03:42.722 --> 02:03:49.566]  They need all those NSA cops to give their kids shots and watch them have convulsions and wonder why, and bite their tongues off and everything.
[02:03:51.267 --> 02:03:56.089]  The cop goes home, changes his son's diapers when he's 10 years old, but then goes out and gets to harass citizens.
[02:03:56.429 --> 02:04:00.251]  When the globalist on record puts stuff in the vaccine to brain damage his son, he doesn't care.
[02:04:00.271 --> 02:04:03.133]  There's cops losing right now.
[02:04:03.473 --> 02:04:04.554]  The government's killed their children.
[02:04:05.154 --> 02:04:05.834]  Kids have died.
[02:04:07.275 --> 02:04:10.417]  Pediatric cancer is up 10,000%, folks, and I'm upset about it.
[02:04:11.690 --> 02:04:19.873]  I noticed that the Raw Story and Right Wing Watch, or whatever it is, made fun of me saying that the government got caught giving people syphilis.
[02:04:19.893 --> 02:04:20.834]  They think that's real funny.
[02:04:20.874 --> 02:04:22.294]  See, because they can laugh.
[02:04:22.634 --> 02:04:23.495]  They all know it's true.
[02:04:24.615 --> 02:04:26.556]  But see, they just laugh at it so it makes it okay.
[02:04:27.236 --> 02:04:28.977]  So I say, go take your shots.
[02:04:29.097 --> 02:04:31.398]  Oh, none of the liberals take the shots.
[02:04:32.963 --> 02:04:39.466]  The liberals that are actually authoritarians and manipulate well-meaning liberals, they don't drink fluoride, they don't take shots, they don't eat GMO.
[02:04:39.766 --> 02:04:41.467]  Just like the Communist Party in China doesn't.
[02:04:41.487 --> 02:04:43.667]  Just like the ruling elite of Europe don't, on record.
[02:04:44.228 --> 02:04:45.928]  They obsess over protecting themselves.
[02:04:46.368 --> 02:04:48.469]  While they poison us, it's all a big sick joke.
[02:04:48.869 --> 02:04:50.970]  So those cops are on the same side as we are.
[02:04:51.370 --> 02:04:55.272]  Even if they don't join us, they're still in the crosshairs being killed by the globalists.
[02:04:56.325 --> 02:05:03.328]  But it's just like in Oblivion, when the rebel character sends Tom Cruise out and says, they go, tell him, and he goes, he won't believe it.
[02:05:03.788 --> 02:05:05.929]  He goes, go to the edge of the radioactive zone.
[02:05:06.429 --> 02:05:08.130]  Once you go there, come back and talk to me.

[02:06:20.009 --> 02:06:26.413]  Listen, there was some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.

[02:07:10.618 --> 02:07:15.719]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[02:07:16.079 --> 02:07:24.562]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[02:07:24.962 --> 02:07:32.264]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[02:07:32.784 --> 02:07:40.186]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.

[02:08:10.919 --> 02:08:17.364]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:08:17.464 --> 02:08:21.547]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:21.847 --> 02:08:27.451]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:08:32.910 --> 02:08:47.297]  Tolls remember to join us on air to talk about
[02:09:01.323 --> 02:09:06.566]  The shutdown of the infrastructure, the shutdown of things the government doesn't even run to harass the public.
[02:09:07.887 --> 02:09:12.990]  What do you think of our reporters going up to the NSA entrance and having them flip out and act like they were terrorists?
[02:09:14.111 --> 02:09:15.292]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:09:15.312 --> 02:09:15.352]  800-259-9231.
[02:09:15.372 --> 02:09:17.993]  The NSA is a technocracy meant to totally take over.
[02:09:29.258 --> 02:09:41.591]  Our society and give a technological breakaway civilization level system of control and surveillance economic and cultural over the population and the world and that's all on record.
[02:09:43.294 --> 02:09:46.157]  Some of the headlines up on InfoWars.com is the live video feed.
[02:09:46.217 --> 02:09:48.499]  NSA tickets InfoWars reporters in Utah.
[02:09:48.979 --> 02:09:51.942]  Americans flood Obamacare Facebook page with complaints.
[02:09:52.483 --> 02:09:53.764]  None of the exchanges have worked.
[02:09:53.824 --> 02:09:54.625]  It's now being reported.
[02:09:55.065 --> 02:09:58.448]  Former NSA head says he'd like to see Snowden on a U.S.
[02:09:58.488 --> 02:09:59.069]  kill list.
[02:10:00.050 --> 02:10:00.550]  That's right.
[02:10:00.630 --> 02:10:03.192]  Anybody that doesn't love the crime is a terrorist.
[02:10:04.233 --> 02:10:07.777]  Gulf storm cancels FEMA's government shutdown furlough.
[02:10:09.321 --> 02:10:10.522]  Obamacare freebie.
[02:10:10.542 --> 02:10:13.883]  They're now giving Obama phones out to anybody that'll sign up for it.
[02:10:14.704 --> 02:10:18.386]  And you get a deadly cancer virus-filled vaccine as well, just like the Tuskegee experiment.
[02:10:18.846 --> 02:10:20.387]  Tom Clancy, question 9-11.
[02:10:20.407 --> 02:10:21.407]  That broke here yesterday.
[02:10:21.447 --> 02:10:23.668]  The video and audio is up on Infowars.com.
[02:10:24.729 --> 02:10:25.489]  Barry Cades.
[02:10:25.729 --> 02:10:28.751]  Feds try to shut down privately-owned Mount Vernon.
[02:10:29.491 --> 02:10:34.694]  And Obama deliberately blocked access to Veterans Memorials to make shutdown appear worse.
[02:10:35.275 --> 02:10:37.336]  And I want to go over some of that and then go to your phone calls.
[02:10:37.376 --> 02:10:39.777]  Toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[02:10:40.918 --> 02:10:44.080]  Here's some of the headlines.
[02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:49.383]  Troops forage for food while golfers still play on the government golf courses.
[02:10:49.563 --> 02:10:51.625]  Of course, because the officers want to play golf.
[02:10:52.725 --> 02:10:54.907]  Founding father's tavern closed by government.
[02:10:56.245 --> 02:11:00.312]  Monuments and memorials remained open during previous shutdowns the AP reported in 1996.
[02:11:01.594 --> 02:11:04.640]  We have a link to that in the Daily Caller article up on InfoWars.com.
[02:11:04.660 --> 02:11:07.304]  If you go to Drudge, it's got the best overall coverage.
[02:11:08.684 --> 02:11:08.904]  I think?
[02:11:28.656 --> 02:11:30.257]  The founding fathers tavern shut down.
[02:11:31.417 --> 02:11:34.238]  Lodge with 12 rooms closes on Cape Cod.
[02:11:34.338 --> 02:11:35.938]  Monuments memorials stayed open.
[02:11:35.958 --> 02:11:36.679]  I just mentioned that.
[02:11:37.119 --> 02:11:38.899]  Grocery stores on army bases closed.
[02:11:38.919 --> 02:11:39.920]  Already mentioned a lot of that.
[02:11:40.820 --> 02:11:43.521]  But student order to change
[02:11:44.873 --> 02:11:47.855]  Offensive NRA shirt, just the letters NRA are offensive.
[02:11:48.916 --> 02:11:55.180]  That's just some of the news on that front.
[02:11:55.761 --> 02:12:01.184]  And they have armed guards now at the memorials, threatening to arrest veterans.
[02:12:01.485 --> 02:12:04.587]  And I keep seeing the images of the cops stopping veterans.
[02:12:04.947 --> 02:12:10.451]  I guess the veterans are following the orders and turning away, or there would have been arrest.
[02:12:11.608 --> 02:12:18.034]  But thank goodness that the NSA is there to spy on the veterans and not on the criminals at the White House.
[02:12:18.955 --> 02:12:22.197]  Here's some of the stuff that is still operating.
[02:12:22.237 --> 02:12:26.261]  This is a Michael Schneider article from Economic Collapse blog up on Infowars.com.
[02:12:26.681 --> 02:12:27.682]  Government shutdown.
[02:12:27.722 --> 02:12:29.224]  This is good to send out to friends and family.
[02:12:30.725 --> 02:12:35.809]  35 or 36 facts which prove that almost everything is still running, unfortunately.
[02:12:36.710 --> 02:12:37.590]  According to the U.S.
[02:12:37.630 --> 02:12:43.793]  Senator Rand Paul, 85% of all government activities are actually being funded during this government shutdown, but they claim it's 71%.
[02:12:44.353 --> 02:12:50.935]  The truth is they're just actually beefing up many of their forces to deny access to people that had vacations and things planned.
[02:12:51.555 --> 02:12:54.876]  Just wait till they run all our health care and everything else and have a cash flow system in place.
[02:12:54.896 --> 02:12:56.317]  I'm sure they won't abuse that or anything.
[02:12:56.777 --> 02:13:02.799]  It just came out that they indeed are persecuting the main preacher from the prayer breakfast that dared to criticize Obama.
[02:13:03.199 --> 02:13:04.320]  That got him an audit.
[02:13:05.849 --> 02:13:10.112]  Admittedly, I mean, the Emperor taught him that's not tyranny.
[02:13:11.412 --> 02:13:16.015]  IRS audited Carson after prayer breakfast speech for his speech.
[02:13:16.455 --> 02:13:17.256]  It's now come out.
[02:13:17.516 --> 02:13:21.798]  They said get him, get him, teach him about his free speech.
[02:13:22.119 --> 02:13:23.399]  Oh, these aren't authoritarians.
[02:13:23.459 --> 02:13:24.180]  Everything's fine.
[02:13:26.423 --> 02:13:33.345]  Approximately 1,350,000 essential federal employees will continue to work during this government shutdown.
[02:13:33.866 --> 02:13:38.507]  Overall, 63% of the federal workforce will continue to work during this government shutdown.
[02:13:38.827 --> 02:13:39.087]  The U.S.
[02:13:39.147 --> 02:13:42.068]  Postal Service will continue to deliver our mail during the shutdown.
[02:13:42.368 --> 02:13:42.568]  U.S.
[02:13:42.609 --> 02:13:46.490]  military personnel will remain on duty and will continue to get paid during the shutdown.
[02:13:46.790 --> 02:13:49.671]  Social Security recipients will continue to get their benefits during the shutdown.
[02:13:50.171 --> 02:13:52.794]  Medicare recipients will continue to get their benefits during the shutdown.
[02:13:53.114 --> 02:13:55.476]  Medicaid recipients will continue to get their benefits during the shutdown.
[02:13:55.776 --> 02:13:58.399]  Food stamp recipients will continue to get their benefits during the shutdown.
[02:13:58.659 --> 02:14:01.522]  Those in unemployment will continue to get their benefits during the shutdown.
[02:14:01.562 --> 02:14:03.183]  Everyone with the World War II vets, they won't.
[02:14:03.604 --> 02:14:05.145]  All the vets won't be getting their pensions, though.
[02:14:05.505 --> 02:14:06.827]  Because globalists love you so much.
[02:14:07.648 --> 02:14:10.690]  Federal retirees will continue to get their pensions, unless you're military.
[02:14:11.511 --> 02:14:12.091]  Because you're the enemy.
[02:14:12.732 --> 02:14:17.494]  You're no longer of use to the New World Order.
[02:14:18.535 --> 02:14:21.897]  Public schools all over the country will continue sucking off everybody's property tax.
[02:14:23.852 --> 02:14:27.695]  Fourteen almost all federal law enforcement officials will continue working.
[02:14:28.116 --> 02:14:32.039]  The Federal Reserve will remain completely functional because it's not federal, it's foreign and private.
[02:14:32.399 --> 02:14:37.743]  The Supreme Court will continue to operate normally and federal courts have enough money sucked out of the public to keep operating.
[02:14:38.124 --> 02:14:40.566]  The TSA employees will continue to molest your family.
[02:14:41.526 --> 02:14:44.168]  Air traffic controllers will continue monitoring traffic at airports.
[02:14:44.509 --> 02:14:48.632]  Hopelessly outmanned Border Patrol agents will continue to try to stem the tide of illegal immigration.
[02:14:49.152 --> 02:14:51.975]  Visas and passports will continue to be issued by the State Department.
[02:14:52.915 --> 02:15:01.597]  Veterans Administration will continue to offer substantial medical services and it will be able to continue processing benefit payments, at least for now, for those that are disabled.
[02:15:01.957 --> 02:15:13.300]  The Obama Administration apparently has plenty of money to have on closing open air memorials that are usually open to the public 24 hours a day, they have extra money to do that, and guard them 24 hours a day to keep the slaves out.
[02:15:13.940 --> 02:15:25.593]  Twenty-three, the Department of Defense announcement that the awarding of ninety-two, ninety-four new contracts worth of combined totals of more than five billion dollars for the government shutdown.
[02:15:25.653 --> 02:15:27.335]  The NSA continued to get its funding.
[02:15:27.355 --> 02:15:29.998]  Twenty-four, the government shutdown has not prevented the new
[02:15:30.999 --> 02:15:35.104]  Two billion dollar NSA spy center opening up that we just visited today.
[02:15:35.144 --> 02:15:36.005]  How dare us?
[02:15:36.686 --> 02:15:43.153]  Twenty-five, federal prisons will continue to operate normally with all their people that didn't pay money to the government for dealing drugs.
[02:15:44.174 --> 02:15:46.557]  If you paid the money, you'd be a CIA commander.
[02:15:46.977 --> 02:15:48.999]  Twenty-six, Amtrak trains will continue to run.
[02:15:49.520 --> 02:15:52.502]  Twenty-seven, the Patent and Trademark Office will continue to be open.
[02:15:52.803 --> 02:16:03.051]  Twenty-eight, the Consumer Product Safety Commission will continue to issue product recalls, and the products create an immediate threat to the safety of human life, like the GMOs and the Aspartame.
[02:16:03.091 --> 02:16:04.272]  Oh, I'm sorry, that'll all stay in.
[02:16:04.652 --> 02:16:08.075]  Twenty-nine, the National Weather Service and Hurricane Center will continue to track
[02:16:08.675 --> 02:16:09.335]  Weather patterns.
[02:16:09.375 --> 02:16:10.656]  Yeah, the satellites are still up there.
[02:16:11.496 --> 02:16:10.656]  30.
[02:16:11.536 --> 02:16:15.558]  If the federal government needs to respond to a natural disaster, the shutdown will not affect that.
[02:16:15.618 --> 02:16:17.198]  Yeah, that's come out now with the new hurricane.
[02:16:17.618 --> 02:16:22.560]  NASA will continue to support the Mars rover and two American astronauts up on the International Space Station.
[02:16:22.580 --> 02:16:22.560]  32.
[02:16:22.900 --> 02:16:23.120]  All city...
[02:16:24.861 --> 02:16:25.942]  Employees of D.C.
[02:16:25.982 --> 02:16:30.665]  government have been deemed essential and will continue to suck off the public.
[02:16:30.685 --> 02:16:30.665]  33.
[02:16:30.905 --> 02:16:38.169]  Even though the Obamacare exchanges are not working properly, people will still be able to access them and be threatened with prison time if they don't pay $5,000.
[02:16:38.389 --> 02:16:42.752]  The IRS will continue to collect taxes and pay it to the private Federal Reserve.
[02:16:43.092 --> 02:16:51.217]  Barack Obama, 35, will continue to get paid the full duration of the shutdown and have red carpets and chefs everywhere and ospreys flying as dog.
[02:16:52.478 --> 02:16:53.079]  Everything else.
[02:16:53.359 --> 02:16:53.719]  The U.S.
[02:16:54.139 --> 02:16:59.303]  Al-Qaeda will still get hundreds of millions a month to attack Syria and blow up all the churches.
[02:16:59.323 --> 02:17:05.208]  36 and chop the priest heads off and rape the nuns and chop children up and scream, we love you Bin Laden, oh so great.
[02:17:05.768 --> 02:17:06.068]  The U.S.
[02:17:06.108 --> 02:17:08.410]  Congress will continue to get paid for the duration of the shutdown.
[02:17:08.430 --> 02:17:09.891]  You want me to just keep going?
[02:17:09.951 --> 02:17:10.752]  Actually, there's too many of these.
[02:17:10.812 --> 02:17:11.352]  I better stop.
[02:17:12.994 --> 02:17:14.735]  I'm going to stop right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:17:15.315 --> 02:17:16.436]  And go to your phone calls.
[02:17:16.496 --> 02:17:17.197]  Go to your phone calls.
[02:17:18.450 --> 02:17:22.513]  Oh, I'm sorry, Obama sounds alarm about social security checks.
[02:17:22.834 --> 02:17:26.797]  Even though you're actually going to be getting them, he's trying to fear monger now that you won't get your checks.
[02:17:27.257 --> 02:17:29.919]  Business Insider's reporting right now.
[02:17:30.620 --> 02:17:32.401]  That's the top link up on DrudgeReport.com.
[02:17:32.441 --> 02:17:36.665]  We're going to get it posted up on InfoWars.com as well and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:17:36.825 --> 02:17:37.606]  Obama just
[02:17:38.683 --> 02:17:41.106]  Played his big Trump card on the debt ceiling.
[02:17:41.607 --> 02:17:42.929]  Reason they want you domesticated.
[02:17:42.969 --> 02:17:43.870]  They've been getting your money.
[02:17:43.890 --> 02:17:48.076]  Doesn't matter that you only get about half of what you would have got with a guaranteed 3% investment.
[02:17:48.777 --> 02:17:49.958]  They've got your money.
[02:17:49.998 --> 02:17:51.300]  Of course, they already stole it all.
[02:17:51.320 --> 02:17:52.562]  They're just giving you fiat currency.
[02:17:52.602 --> 02:17:53.162]  It doesn't matter.
[02:17:53.763 --> 02:18:02.969]  Early today, the Potomac Research Group analyst Craig Valerie predicted that if the debt ceiling deadline grew closer, President Barack Obama would play his Trump card in the debate.
[02:18:03.370 --> 02:18:08.513]  He would remind seniors that if Congress doesn't raise the debt ceiling, seniors wouldn't get their Social Security checks.
[02:18:08.913 --> 02:18:19.941]  GOP strategist Karl Rove surely knows that it's just a matter of time before President Obama throws a game changer, warning seniors that their Social Security checks won't be mailed because of John Boehner.
[02:18:20.521 --> 02:18:26.267]  Valerie wrote, a few hours later, Obama did just that during a speech at M. Lewis Construction Company.
[02:18:26.867 --> 02:18:30.591]  He said, if a government shutdown, Social Security checks will still go out on time.
[02:18:30.971 --> 02:18:35.515]  An economic shutdown, if we don't raise the debt ceiling, they won't go out on time.
[02:18:35.655 --> 02:18:40.680]  Obama said, in a government shutdown, disability benefits still arrive on time.
[02:18:40.720 --> 02:18:42.202]  In an economic shutdown, they won't.
[02:18:42.702 --> 02:18:46.865]  He went on to basically say we have to fund our obligations or it'll collapse.
[02:18:47.205 --> 02:18:51.388]  Holding us hostage, ladies and gentlemen, to the New World Order.
[02:18:51.948 --> 02:18:53.229]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[02:18:54.530 --> 02:18:56.031]  That's what it's all about.
[02:18:57.732 --> 02:18:59.513]  Nick-mack paddywhack.
[02:18:59.593 --> 02:19:00.674]  Give the dog a bone.
[02:19:01.434 --> 02:19:04.156]  The New World Order has turned us all into domesticated slaves.
[02:19:04.456 --> 02:19:06.557]  So take your vaccines and remember they love you.
[02:19:07.098 --> 02:19:08.419]  Frank in Michigan, you're on the air.
[02:19:08.479 --> 02:19:09.359]  Go ahead, extremist.
[02:19:10.720 --> 02:19:11.180]  Hello, Alex?
[02:19:11.480 --> 02:19:11.841]  Hey, buddy.
[02:19:12.762 --> 02:19:13.522]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:19:13.582 --> 02:19:15.183]  I hope you're having a good day today.
[02:19:15.543 --> 02:19:18.123]  Oh, I kind of blew up earlier and shot my voice out, but I'm alright.
[02:19:18.143 --> 02:19:20.364]  Yeah, I saw that.
[02:19:20.384 --> 02:19:26.765]  Hey, you know, I just want to say something about this whole World War II vet thing.
[02:19:27.105 --> 02:19:31.646]  You know, I'm so angered about it, I can barely see straight.
[02:19:31.767 --> 02:19:32.987]  Oh, take some pills.
[02:19:33.027 --> 02:19:33.827]  The government loves you.
[02:19:33.887 --> 02:19:35.547]  Yeah, they'd love that.
[02:19:36.108 --> 02:19:39.828]  You know, I just have a couple of comments about it.
[02:19:39.848 --> 02:19:42.149]  I'd like to see what you think about it.
[02:19:43.090 --> 02:19:49.995]  Um, you know, there's been a lot of coverage on these vets coming, making their pilgrimage.
[02:19:50.996 --> 02:19:54.138]  Some of them, it's the only time they can make it to see it.
[02:19:55.078 --> 02:20:04.045]  And, you know, it breaks my heart, you know, to see these men that fought, watched their buddies die in combat.
[02:20:04.165 --> 02:20:08.308]  And now they've got extra duty police in overtime to not let them go on the memorial?
[02:20:10.674 --> 02:20:14.137]  For over five years, you've been hearing about the Berkey guy.
[02:20:14.477 --> 02:20:16.298]  So you may know a few things about him.
[02:20:16.579 --> 02:20:22.823]  For example, you are well aware of the superior quality and effectiveness of Berkey water filters and accessories.
[02:20:23.264 --> 02:20:28.508]  But did you know the Berkeys have had independent lab tests done to prove just how effective they are?
[02:20:28.868 --> 02:20:31.390]  It's true, and he can email you the test results.
[02:20:31.730 --> 02:20:33.611]  Just visit GoBerky.com.

[02:21:10.379 --> 02:21:11.739]  You are now in the crosshairs.
[02:21:12.019 --> 02:21:16.140]  The NSA and the FBI are treating you like a criminal and monitoring your every move.
[02:21:16.460 --> 02:21:23.182]  Ron Paul said recently, the evidence of the totalitarian nature of this government is on display undeniably every day.
[02:21:23.682 --> 02:21:27.523]  What's taking place right now is a coup and the destruction of the Constitution.
[02:21:27.943 --> 02:21:29.743]  Fortunately, there is something you can do about it.
[02:21:30.043 --> 02:21:34.184]  Learn how to be invisible, lock down your privacy, and even disappear forever.

[02:21:39.466 --> 02:21:40.507]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:40.587 --> 02:21:44.909]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:21:45.069 --> 02:21:50.692]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:21:50.792 --> 02:21:54.134]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:21:54.374 --> 02:21:56.936]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:59.157 --> 02:22:01.858]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[02:22:14.466 --> 02:22:22.951]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[02:22:23.372 --> 02:22:30.657]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.

[02:24:20.934 --> 02:24:28.096]  Back in 1992, I used to watch Alexander Haig's Business News Hour almost every day when I had a chance, on cable.
[02:24:30.373 --> 02:24:43.617]  And he explained how the NSA was going to watch everybody, everything would go through these data clouds, how there'd be blimps and drones that were solar-powered, that were ultralight, launched, that would watch everything we did and track everybody.
[02:24:44.778 --> 02:24:48.719]  And he had a company that actually sold the plans for it to DARPA.
[02:24:49.139 --> 02:24:53.661]  Here it is on Infowars.com, meet the drone that can fly for years.
[02:24:54.801 --> 02:25:04.705]  And it's an ultralight aircraft with solar wings and tail, with a loving surveillance pod, of course, that can fly for years, watching you, the slaves.
[02:25:06.326 --> 02:25:11.368]  And it's so lightweight, when it crashes, it won't even hurt anybody, unless it was to actually crash into a person.
[02:25:11.388 --> 02:25:13.609]  If it crashed into your house, it would just crumple up.
[02:25:14.582 --> 02:25:21.105]  So, and they've got your money, unlimited, in contracts they give themselves, so they're just going to launch tens of thousands of these.
[02:25:21.785 --> 02:25:24.267]  But don't try to videotape, or you're a terrorist.
[02:25:25.307 --> 02:25:28.068]  And don't point out they run Al Qaeda publicly, or you're a terrorist.
[02:25:28.129 --> 02:25:31.090]  And don't point out that they're New World Order, or you're a terrorist.
[02:25:32.010 --> 02:25:34.111]  Frank in Michigan, then we'll go to Allen and others.
[02:25:34.131 --> 02:25:34.892]  What was your point, sir?
[02:25:35.892 --> 02:25:37.633]  Well, my thought is this.
[02:25:39.074 --> 02:25:41.555]  We're our senators and our congressmen.
[02:25:42.284 --> 02:25:43.445]  They're all watching this, too.
[02:25:43.545 --> 02:25:53.712]  Why can't they come down there to that memorial and take a stand and say, you know, this is ridiculous what these men come through.
[02:25:54.252 --> 02:25:59.155]  Let's see what the Obama police do to them.
[02:25:59.856 --> 02:26:01.016]  I mean, you know, they're for us.
[02:26:01.096 --> 02:26:02.557]  They're for the American people.
[02:26:03.818 --> 02:26:04.158]  Prove it.
[02:26:04.439 --> 02:26:05.339]  Show me what you got.
[02:26:05.859 --> 02:26:10.983]  Show me how, you know, how you're going to represent me by defending these Americans
[02:26:12.834 --> 02:26:31.168]  Well, I'll be honest with you, I think George Washington was the greatest generation, and of course both my grandfathers were in World War II and were great guys, and compared to us, they were a great generation, a greatest generation.
[02:26:32.651 --> 02:26:41.134]  I think part of this greatest generation thing is what made everybody think, well, the government can do no wrong, let's all go to sleep, we're the good guys, and so evil totally took over.
[02:26:41.694 --> 02:26:50.957]  But the archetypal image of the vets being turned away from memorials, the feds don't even run, but they're out there grandstanding, shows what tyrants the system is.
[02:26:51.878 --> 02:26:53.958]  And they didn't even see this as a PR disaster.
[02:26:54.499 --> 02:26:58.300]  That's how ham-fisted the authoritarians are.
[02:26:59.372 --> 02:27:07.997]  But yes, I get very upset when I see founding fathers like George Washington demonized by the Department of Defense in official manuals.
[02:27:08.398 --> 02:27:10.499]  So of course they don't like the World War II veterans.
[02:27:10.979 --> 02:27:14.622]  And of course it's only World War II veterans that'll push past cops.
[02:27:15.982 --> 02:27:21.146]  They had a lot of cases, one in Tennessee but some other famous cases when vets came back during
[02:27:23.513 --> 02:27:27.055]  The end of World War II and they'd come back and boss hogs had taken over their towns.
[02:27:27.235 --> 02:27:28.715]  There's the Battle of Athens, Tennessee.
[02:27:28.735 --> 02:27:29.436]  You can pull that up.
[02:27:29.456 --> 02:27:30.276]  They made a movie out of it.
[02:27:30.296 --> 02:27:30.896]  It's a true story.
[02:27:31.396 --> 02:27:34.878]  Where the boss hogs wouldn't let them have the election and were enslaving everybody with taxes.
[02:27:35.478 --> 02:27:37.919]  So they just went and had a gun battle with them and ran them out.
[02:27:39.240 --> 02:27:41.421]  And the county tried to call the police on them.
[02:27:42.101 --> 02:27:43.422]  And tried to call the feds on them.
[02:27:44.262 --> 02:27:46.443]  And tried to call the governor on them and nobody stood with them.
[02:27:47.263 --> 02:27:48.844]  Because everybody knew it was a corrupt town.
[02:27:48.864 --> 02:27:50.845]  So, I mean, you've got to say
[02:27:53.342 --> 02:28:12.468]  I know my grandfather on my dad's side helped push a bunch of boss hog types out that were overtaxing people when he came back from World War II and he got elected county tax assessor and stuff and cut the taxes way down and I still run into people out in that county in East Texas who come up and thank me for my family cutting property taxes down to nothing.
[02:28:13.288 --> 02:28:14.009]  Because that was the view.
[02:28:14.049 --> 02:28:17.350]  If you're a poor person, you know what, we're just not, there's no property taxes.
[02:28:17.610 --> 02:28:18.150]  How's that sound?
[02:28:19.841 --> 02:28:24.502]  I mean, and that's what the, because the property taxes are unconstitutional, folks.
[02:28:25.222 --> 02:28:40.325]  Only people that got taxed, when my grandfather got elected a county tax assessor and died county tax assessor, died county tax assessor in Freestone County, when he died county tax assessor, people came from all over the place.
[02:28:41.845 --> 02:28:43.045]  Shots fired, U.S.
[02:28:43.065 --> 02:28:46.186]  Capitol, oh, they're pulling a big distraction on us.
[02:28:46.991 --> 02:28:47.631]  We're going to go on a break.
[02:28:47.671 --> 02:28:49.872]  I just canceled our guest that's coming up so I can get to everybody's calls.
[02:28:49.932 --> 02:28:50.872]  Frank, I appreciate you.
[02:28:50.892 --> 02:28:53.453]  We're going to get to everybody else and cover these shots when we come back.
[02:28:54.634 --> 02:28:56.574]  But look for him to stage a bunch of stuff.
[02:28:56.934 --> 02:29:02.556]  Butchenik, who's really got his ear to the ground, he says the Navy Yard was a staged event and he has sources.
[02:29:03.036 --> 02:29:09.979]  So look for more of that to happen very, very soon to change the subject because everything the globalists do is falling apart right now.
[02:29:11.319 --> 02:29:13.600]  But I was getting into county tax assessing.
[02:29:15.464 --> 02:29:26.693]  His view was, you tax the big corporations that come into town, because they're getting the infrastructure anyways, and they want to help the community, and then you don't tax poor people.
[02:29:28.374 --> 02:29:32.278]  You don't predatorily use property taxes to take poor people's land.
[02:29:33.959 --> 02:29:35.780]  And of course, that's the old-fashioned model.
[02:29:37.141 --> 02:29:39.824]  He was elected on a whole wave of Eisenhower Republicans.
[02:29:41.061 --> 02:29:42.281]  We're mainly World War II vets.
[02:29:42.961 --> 02:29:49.803]  But we need the same type of revolution in this country now, where people just start not doing what the globalists want.
[02:29:51.503 --> 02:29:52.324]  That's what we need.
[02:29:52.424 --> 02:29:54.144]  Every generation has to deal with this type of stuff.
[02:29:54.164 --> 02:29:56.085]  We're going to come back and take more phone calls.
[02:29:56.105 --> 02:29:56.565]  Stay with us.
[02:29:59.445 --> 02:30:00.346]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.846 --> 02:30:02.446]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.366 --> 02:30:06.047]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.307 --> 02:30:11.288]  Ben Swan here.
[02:30:11.548 --> 02:30:12.670]  We are winning.
[02:30:12.730 --> 02:30:19.957]  Alternative media is challenging and beating mainstream media, and it's imperative for the liberty movement to continue this momentum.
[02:30:20.458 --> 02:30:27.045]  However, independent media cannot win without the support of sponsors and advertisers like Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:30:27.485 --> 02:30:32.851]  For over 26 years, Diamond Gusset has been owned by patriots with products designed for patriots.
[02:30:33.331 --> 02:30:38.836]  When I put on a pair of Diamond Gusset jeans, I enjoy the quality, comfort, durability and style.
[02:30:39.357 --> 02:30:42.179]  Most importantly, my wife really likes them as well.
[02:30:42.680 --> 02:30:49.886]  From the cotton to the last stitch, Diamond Gusset bucks the industry standard by producing a 100% all-American product.
[02:30:50.186 --> 02:30:51.608]  Another reason for my endorsement.

[02:31:10.714 --> 02:31:14.396]  Research shows that the next Great Depression is inevitable and unstoppable.
[02:31:14.657 --> 02:31:16.438]  It is suicide to not be prepared.
[02:31:16.838 --> 02:31:21.741]  Some reviews are already saying that Locusts on the Horizon is one of the best prepper books ever written.
[02:31:22.282 --> 02:31:26.244]  It provides over 1,100 pages for the full spectrum of vital prepper knowledge.

[02:31:55.898 --> 02:31:56.838]  Time is running out.
[02:31:56.958 --> 02:31:58.499]  The time to prepare is now.
[02:31:58.639 --> 02:32:02.340]  Your copy of Locusts on the Horizon is available immediately on Amazon.

[02:32:10.407 --> 02:32:15.311]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[02:32:15.912 --> 02:32:19.195]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[02:32:19.735 --> 02:32:22.617]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[02:32:23.158 --> 02:32:25.980]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[02:32:26.601 --> 02:32:32.626]  Supernatural Silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[02:32:33.227 --> 02:32:36.650]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[02:32:37.290 --> 02:32:47.972]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[02:32:48.693 --> 02:32:53.694]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically.
[02:32:54.194 --> 02:32:59.615]  To find out more information on how supernatural silver can help you win the war against deadly pathogens,

[02:33:27.180 --> 02:33:31.898]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:48.840 --> 02:33:51.223]  My friends, shots fired near the Capitol.
[02:33:51.263 --> 02:33:52.705]  The Capitol's on lockdown.
[02:33:53.566 --> 02:33:56.370]  They're supposedly chasing some sub-suspect.
[02:33:58.393 --> 02:34:01.557]  This is the second highest crime rate in the country is D.C.
[02:34:01.577 --> 02:34:03.039]  with the total gunman for slaves.
[02:34:03.900 --> 02:34:06.521]  And so just more grandstanding by the permanent state.
[02:34:07.801 --> 02:34:10.422]  Again, I've been to third world countries that are nothing like D.C.
[02:34:10.442 --> 02:34:12.222]  You were treated like absolute trash.
[02:34:12.582 --> 02:34:14.963]  So are families with children by the goons.
[02:34:16.343 --> 02:34:20.064]  And I shouldn't say goons, the Capitol SWAT team are listeners, but they actually respond to stuff.
[02:34:20.084 --> 02:34:22.325]  I'm talking about the general security guards and police.
[02:34:22.645 --> 02:34:29.287]  But there they are running around with their guns right there, the guys that were told to stand down a few weeks ago at the Navy Yard event.
[02:34:29.567 --> 02:34:30.547]  Let's go to some of that audio.
[02:34:31.770 --> 02:34:33.892]  ...members coming down the steps after a vote.
[02:34:34.252 --> 02:34:38.055]  He didn't have anything on him, but they really, you know, took that very seriously.
[02:34:38.095 --> 02:34:39.816]  They tackled him toward the top of the steps.
[02:34:39.836 --> 02:34:41.097]  They were very concerned about that.
[02:34:41.578 --> 02:34:48.423]  And in July of 1998, there was a shooting here where they killed two Capitol Police officers, Jacob Chestnut
[02:34:48.923 --> 02:34:49.664]  Uh, was one of them.
[02:34:50.044 --> 02:34:57.590]  And, uh, and, uh, and, uh, uh, the officer who was on Tom DeLay's detail at the time, uh, he came in through a door and shot people immediately.
[02:34:57.670 --> 02:35:01.653]  And at that point, those were the only two people ever killed defending the U.S.
[02:35:01.693 --> 02:35:02.074]  Capitol.
[02:35:02.094 --> 02:35:02.794]  That was in July of 1998.
[02:35:03.835 --> 02:35:06.777]  All right, Chad Pergrim giving us the latest details there.
[02:35:07.238 --> 02:35:17.146]  Now it's just breaking news coming into Fox that there may have in fact been those shots fired inside the Capitol building as was originally reported, then quickly changed to outside.
[02:35:17.206 --> 02:35:20.449]  Let's get right to our Kathryn Harridge, who may have the very latest on that.
[02:35:20.509 --> 02:35:21.529]  Kathryn, what can you tell us?
[02:35:22.330 --> 02:35:23.451]  Yeah, thank you very much, Gretchen.
[02:35:23.471 --> 02:35:29.595]  A short time ago, I was not able to get through immediately to someone at Homeland Security because of the government shutdown.
[02:35:29.615 --> 02:35:34.278]  About one in ten of the employees over at Homeland Security are out this week.
[02:35:34.318 --> 02:35:35.258]  By the way, that's pure bull.
[02:35:35.278 --> 02:35:36.659]  They never answer the phone.
[02:35:40.422 --> 02:35:43.645]  How many times have we tried to call that number on air?
[02:35:43.665 --> 02:35:44.726]  Probably 20?
[02:35:44.926 --> 02:35:46.327]  They never answer?
[02:35:46.607 --> 02:35:49.230]  Or once they did and it was like rerouted to 911?
[02:35:49.270 --> 02:35:49.770]  That's enough.
[02:35:58.038 --> 02:36:01.885]  You know, the last four or five times this happened, it was backfires in the parking garage.
[02:36:02.265 --> 02:36:05.651]  Guys, search Capitol evacuated for backfires.
[02:36:06.132 --> 02:36:08.696]  In the parking garage, there was a backfire in front.
[02:36:09.177 --> 02:36:11.140]  Land of the free, home of the brave, everyone falls.
[02:36:12.199 --> 02:36:19.885]  In Land of the Free, Home of the Brave, you fall on your back like a turtle or a beetle, and you go, uh, uh, and then that supposedly is what a person does.
[02:36:20.465 --> 02:36:23.007]  Just everyone grovels and says, Black Ski Mask, save me!
[02:36:23.647 --> 02:36:24.868]  If there's any type of problem.
[02:36:24.888 --> 02:36:28.071]  But when there's a real shooting, then the SWAT team's ordered to stand down.
[02:36:29.051 --> 02:36:30.352]  And the word is from Pachenik.
[02:36:31.113 --> 02:36:36.377]  He's coming on tomorrow, is that he actually has the sources that that was a staged event.
[02:36:37.137 --> 02:36:38.458]  So we're going to be breaking that down.
[02:36:38.498 --> 02:36:40.340]  And the ATF says they're not allowed to go in there.
[02:36:42.418 --> 02:36:48.719]  But of course, this is just a government that's been caught hundreds of times, engaged in thousands of different operations that have killed U.S.
[02:36:48.780 --> 02:36:57.181]  troops, foster kids, poor people in the Appalachias, poor blacks in Alabama, Tuskegee Experiment, everybody knows about that, so I mentioned that one.
[02:36:57.201 --> 02:37:02.003]  There are thousands of those, ongoing, where they just kill people.
[02:37:02.023 --> 02:37:06.284]  It's like, oh, the government secretly kills people and gets caught and doesn't get in trouble, but everything's fine.
[02:37:06.324 --> 02:37:07.184]  Take these shots.
[02:37:07.224 --> 02:37:08.424]  They really want you to take them.
[02:37:09.524 --> 02:37:11.045]  I mean, that's not even 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[02:37:12.324 --> 02:37:18.370]  Of course, a Common Core listener would actually say to me, well, it actually equals five.
[02:37:19.471 --> 02:37:24.236]  By the way, I have a crew member who has family that lives in New York who are big Obama supporters, big liberals.
[02:37:24.857 --> 02:37:32.464]  They're finally awake because my crew member's niece going to public school
[02:37:34.026 --> 02:38:02.328]  Uh, is being taught 2 plus 2 equals 5, uh, is being told to do, uh, math questions that are multiple choice, uh, that answer questions about the family, where he write, like, essays, where they have pro- properly, uh, uh, ask questions where, if you don't do your homework or if you don't do the dishes, does your mom yell at you, uh, spank you, hurt you, and- and of course, even the Obama supporters understand this is ways, with their name on it, to get intel on the family.
[02:38:03.697 --> 02:38:04.477]  With third graders.
[02:38:04.497 --> 02:38:08.119]  And of course, on record, they're doing it.
[02:38:08.159 --> 02:38:24.986]  But imagine, even the Obama supporters love their kids enough that when the third grader, I guess that's seven, eight years old, comes home and is taught two plus two equals five or whatever, it's stuff like that, that it is flipping them out.
[02:38:25.768 --> 02:38:30.371]  Because not only is it 2 plus 2 equals 5, that's first grade stuff or kindergarten stuff.
[02:38:30.731 --> 02:38:34.833]  They're now retrograding back to kindergarten work for A students.
[02:38:35.334 --> 02:38:37.435]  It's meant to wreck everything.
[02:38:38.235 --> 02:38:41.297]  Intelligence is the enemy of this military takeover.
[02:38:42.238 --> 02:38:43.198]  But it works against them.
[02:38:43.238 --> 02:38:51.063]  It's like they had like nine different NSA cops out there with the cameras for 20 minutes, because you already said, and they couldn't figure out how to erase it.
[02:38:53.564 --> 02:38:58.728]  They were unable to put it in and flip through the camera and hit erase, erase, erase.
[02:39:00.389 --> 02:39:03.111]  Of course, they don't even know we can extract it off there anyways.
[02:39:03.731 --> 02:39:05.532]  I mean, I thought cops knew stuff like this.
[02:39:06.093 --> 02:39:09.715]  So it's just, it's not like it's something secret anyways.
[02:39:09.976 --> 02:39:12.157]  It's a parking lot outside the gate entrance.
[02:39:13.218 --> 02:39:15.239]  Just, I mean, we don't even want the stupid footage.
[02:39:15.259 --> 02:39:19.402]  That's why I was telling Gucciardi, well, let them erase it if they're going to take it away, but it didn't matter.
[02:39:19.422 --> 02:39:20.223]  They just did it anyways.
[02:39:21.335 --> 02:39:22.516]  And of course, we had a live feed.
[02:39:22.556 --> 02:39:23.896]  They didn't seem to understand that.
[02:39:23.916 --> 02:39:26.217]  Because he's on the tape going, live feed.
[02:39:26.237 --> 02:39:27.738]  And the guy goes, huh?
[02:39:27.798 --> 02:39:28.418]  What's that?
[02:39:29.939 --> 02:39:30.599]  I'm sorry.
[02:39:30.679 --> 02:39:31.900]  I'm not trying to be mean here.
[02:39:33.801 --> 02:39:34.941]  It's just ridiculous.
[02:39:35.602 --> 02:39:48.327]  And why are these cops, who normally aren't at Mount Verdon or aren't at the World War II Memorial, they're ordered in overtime, federal police, to go guard it and not let people into it as a stunt.
[02:39:48.407 --> 02:39:49.228]  That's now come out.
[02:39:50.419 --> 02:39:51.121]  As a stunt.
[02:39:52.424 --> 02:39:56.874]  Why are the cops not getting with their union and refusing to do this?
[02:39:58.643 --> 02:40:02.004]  We want you to go out to Mount Vernon and not let people in.
[02:40:02.505 --> 02:40:10.848]  And the cops are like, okay, instead of, well, that's a private group run by a private company that's a profit maker and they have tourists coming in there by the thousands.
[02:40:10.908 --> 02:40:14.830]  We don't, that's not even federal, federally controlled now.
[02:40:14.890 --> 02:40:19.111]  They just go, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[02:40:19.612 --> 02:40:20.152]  Let me do that.
[02:40:20.392 --> 02:40:20.892]  Let me do that.
[02:40:21.132 --> 02:40:21.652]  Let me do that.
[02:40:21.853 --> 02:40:22.353]  Let me do that.
[02:40:22.593 --> 02:40:24.033]  Just a nation of I'll do that.
[02:40:24.274 --> 02:40:24.774]  I'll do that.
[02:40:24.994 --> 02:40:25.714]  I'll do what I'm told.
[02:40:25.894 --> 02:40:26.214]  I'll do it.
[02:40:26.434 --> 02:40:27.495]  It's like Austin cops.
[02:40:28.669 --> 02:40:31.850]  Almost every Austin cop I run into is actually pretty nice, a listener.
[02:40:31.870 --> 02:40:37.711]  I mean, they're not perfect, but compared to a lot of cities, I gotta admit, we have pretty good cops in Austin on average.
[02:40:38.651 --> 02:40:46.632]  As the city gets bigger, there's more problems, there's gonna be statistically more bad things that happen, and they just fired a cop that for no reason shot at some guy at a traffic stop.
[02:40:47.672 --> 02:40:49.413]  So, I mean, they're doing the right thing on a lot of levels.
[02:40:49.853 --> 02:40:57.214]  But still, my people are out there, and I'm going to your calls, I don't know, five months ago, handing out free InfoWars magazines.
[02:40:58.592 --> 02:41:05.640]  They're handing them out and the cops come over and say, you're not allowed to hand those out in Austin.
[02:41:06.361 --> 02:41:08.463]  We said, First Amendment, there's no law.
[02:41:08.483 --> 02:41:10.125]  And they said, we're just been told we're sorry.
[02:41:11.166 --> 02:41:13.189]  And then I get the cops on the phone.
[02:41:14.500 --> 02:41:18.682]  via cell phone with my street team, and I say, listen, I'm going to sue you if you keep this up.
[02:41:18.722 --> 02:41:19.603]  You know there's no law.
[02:41:20.143 --> 02:41:21.564]  He goes, man, I've just been told to do this.
[02:41:21.584 --> 02:41:22.964]  And I said, you better get your superior.
[02:41:23.465 --> 02:41:28.847]  Because I said, I don't want to sue you, but let me tell you, I got 10,000 magazines and a group paid to hand these out.
[02:41:29.188 --> 02:41:30.468]  And I'm going to make a big deal of this.
[02:41:30.548 --> 02:41:33.130]  I'm coming back from the Texas coast right now.
[02:41:33.270 --> 02:41:34.110]  I'm getting in my car.
[02:41:34.450 --> 02:41:35.831]  I'm not supposed to come back till tomorrow.
[02:41:36.151 --> 02:41:37.512]  I'm coming down there right now.
[02:41:38.581 --> 02:41:39.823]  And I said, I'm not threatening you.
[02:41:39.923 --> 02:41:40.904]  I'm going to sue you.
[02:41:41.084 --> 02:41:42.325]  Don't violate my First Amendment.
[02:41:42.746 --> 02:41:44.428]  He goes, oh, I know, Alex.
[02:41:44.648 --> 02:41:44.989]  I know.
[02:41:45.429 --> 02:41:47.692]  Then they go and then they send the code enforcers.
[02:41:47.992 --> 02:41:50.115]  I get them on the phone as I'm driving back.
[02:41:50.555 --> 02:41:51.596]  And I go, I'm going to sue you.
[02:41:51.636 --> 02:41:52.918]  And the guy's like, listen, I'm a listener.
[02:41:53.298 --> 02:41:54.079]  I don't like this.
[02:41:54.540 --> 02:41:56.162]  And I've been told by the city to do it.
[02:41:57.063 --> 02:41:58.605]  I said, you better tell them, no, I'm going to sue you.
[02:42:01.653 --> 02:42:03.396]  And by the time I got there, they backed off.
[02:42:03.456 --> 02:42:06.701]  But, I mean, why do you follow illegal orders?
[02:42:07.342 --> 02:42:09.165]  Do you think I wanted to come home a day early?
[02:42:10.448 --> 02:42:12.251]  And pull my kids out of the hotel swimming pool?
[02:42:13.812 --> 02:42:17.453]  And get in my car and point it up here on a little two-day vacation I had?
[02:42:17.813 --> 02:42:20.474]  You think I wanted that to go down there and bullhorn South by Southwest?
[02:42:20.754 --> 02:42:29.556]  Then it turned out a bunch of out-of-control local mafia had ordered us shut down and no free speech in Austin, literally claiming they own the whole city.
[02:42:29.916 --> 02:42:36.398]  They even tried to send police, we learned, to private bars that have their own live music, saying no live music's allowed unless they run it.
[02:42:36.638 --> 02:42:37.138]  Literally.
[02:42:37.778 --> 02:42:38.338]  Literally.
[02:42:38.618 --> 02:42:39.619]  Boss hog behavior.
[02:42:40.139 --> 02:42:43.380]  Why were you following the orders of those dirtbags?
[02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:45.181]  A bunch of beatnik mafia.
[02:42:46.301 --> 02:42:50.543]  Who make, you know, $20 million a year off the thing with a bunch of yuppies thinking they're gonna be famous.
[02:42:50.623 --> 02:42:51.483]  Giant scam.
[02:42:52.063 --> 02:42:53.724]  I mean, what is wrong with you?
[02:42:53.744 --> 02:42:56.725]  Alright, I'm ranting and I apologize.
[02:42:57.025 --> 02:42:59.486]  I just go all over the map, don't I?
[02:42:59.506 --> 02:43:06.168]  I was supposed to do final voiceovers for Obama Deception 2 today and my voice is blown from screaming earlier.
[02:43:07.455 --> 02:43:08.576]  I just cannot do it anymore.
[02:43:08.616 --> 02:43:09.837]  People say, why do I have a deep voice?
[02:43:10.478 --> 02:43:12.600]  It's not a deep voice, it's a fried voice, is what it is.
[02:43:14.102 --> 02:43:16.284]  Autobots transform and roll out.
[02:43:16.764 --> 02:43:19.086]  Let's go ahead and talk to Allen in Delaware.
[02:43:19.126 --> 02:43:20.388]  Thanks for holding her on the air, Allen.
[02:43:21.772 --> 02:43:24.054]  Hey Alex, man, so good to talk to you again.
[02:43:24.374 --> 02:43:25.034]  You know something?
[02:43:25.054 --> 02:43:27.316]  We've got to change the way we talk in this country.
[02:43:27.636 --> 02:43:32.339]  The problem that we have right now is people are calling them Republicans and Democrats and politicians.
[02:43:32.740 --> 02:43:33.800]  They're plotiticians.
[02:43:34.421 --> 02:43:34.821]  Plotting!
[02:43:34.981 --> 02:43:35.322]  Plotting!
[02:43:35.522 --> 02:43:35.862]  Plotting!
[02:43:36.042 --> 02:43:36.422]  Plotting!
[02:43:36.662 --> 02:43:37.823]  They're Nazis, Alex!
[02:43:38.484 --> 02:43:44.188]  They are parasite scum, run by foreign banks, given orders to totally shut everything down.
[02:43:45.137 --> 02:43:54.304]  We are in the most diabolical Bugs Bunny cartoon and Elmer Fudd is running around with guns trying to set up these false flags.
[02:43:54.344 --> 02:43:55.705]  And let me tell you something, people.
[02:43:56.125 --> 02:44:00.148]  I'm not doing the Everyman Show on Blog Talk Radio because I'm a moron.
[02:44:00.529 --> 02:44:02.850]  I'm doing it because I've got to put out the word.
[02:44:03.191 --> 02:44:05.612]  Alex, you've inspired me in ways I can't tell you.
[02:44:05.813 --> 02:44:11.457]  Do you know when I quit eating aspartame just six weeks ago, I've lost 27 pounds at 56 years old.
[02:44:14.560 --> 02:44:22.569]  I'm jumping through hoops and over the moon, off the corn fructose, I'm eating vitamins, I'm trying to get the best I can, I'm out of money.
[02:44:22.729 --> 02:44:26.193]  That's terrorism, terrorism, terrorism, take, that's racist.
[02:44:26.773 --> 02:44:31.118]  Take fluoride, drink fluoride, eat GMO, go to McDonald's or you're racist.
[02:44:31.839 --> 02:44:35.283]  Alright, here I am out here in the middle of my field here in Delaware.
[02:44:35.323 --> 02:44:35.703]  Racist.
[02:44:38.049 --> 02:44:41.671]  No, no, Michael Moore said being white living in the countryside is racist.
[02:44:41.811 --> 02:44:42.211]  Racist!
[02:44:42.532 --> 02:44:42.932]  Racist!
[02:44:43.192 --> 02:44:44.573]  Racist!
[02:44:44.613 --> 02:44:48.075]  Listen, I got this corn in my hand, it's on the stalk.
[02:44:48.135 --> 02:44:48.575]  That's racist.
[02:44:48.635 --> 02:44:49.896]  And I'm looking at the corn.
[02:44:50.216 --> 02:44:52.397]  There's no bugs on the corn.
[02:44:52.698 --> 02:44:55.339]  There's no bugs flying around the corn.
[02:44:55.800 --> 02:44:57.440]  I've got three bugs, Alex.
[02:44:58.161 --> 02:45:01.923]  One of them is a black bee with a horsefly body.
[02:45:02.023 --> 02:45:03.324]  That's an al-Qaeda operative.
[02:45:04.582 --> 02:45:12.350]  He's got the gold, you know, the gold like, what do you call it, the thing around his neck, the nape, and he's got two big eyes and horsefly.
[02:45:12.671 --> 02:45:17.776]  I had another one with spiders with eyes on his antennas crawling up my house.
[02:45:18.137 --> 02:45:20.960]  Now I'm telling you people that Delaware, whether you believe it or not...
[02:45:21.520 --> 02:45:23.361]  This is Biden territory, okay?
[02:45:23.381 --> 02:45:24.602]  Beau Biden... Oh, I know.
[02:45:24.742 --> 02:45:27.184]  I know they're doing all sorts of mutations of everything right now.
[02:45:27.264 --> 02:45:27.704]  No, that's it.
[02:45:27.724 --> 02:45:28.145]  You're right.
[02:45:28.605 --> 02:45:29.926]  A lot of the birds and stuff are dying.
[02:45:29.966 --> 02:45:30.786]  Most of the bees are dying.
[02:45:30.826 --> 02:45:31.547]  It's okay, though.
[02:45:32.207 --> 02:45:32.748]  It's okay.
[02:45:32.768 --> 02:45:34.029]  Just eat the GMO, brother.
[02:45:34.289 --> 02:45:36.090]  The glyphosate will help you.
[02:45:37.111 --> 02:45:39.392]  Do you believe Beau Biden was sick a month ago?
[02:45:40.273 --> 02:45:41.574]  I believe Beau Biden loves us.
[02:45:42.848 --> 02:45:46.991]  I believe that Beau Biden went down to Texas to say goodbye to George Bush Sr.
[02:45:47.772 --> 02:45:54.617]  I believe they moved to Paraguay on 100,000 acres, on the biggest aquifer- I agree, but it's for the church.
[02:45:54.677 --> 02:45:56.298]  ...into the southern hemisphere.
[02:45:56.378 --> 02:45:59.881]  I got five bottles, listen, I got five bottles of your nascent coming.
[02:45:59.901 --> 02:46:00.922]  I'm waiting on it right now.
[02:46:00.942 --> 02:46:02.323]  It should have been delivered here by now.
[02:46:02.843 --> 02:46:06.987]  And when I heard Dick Cheney 10 years ago, or even just, how long was it?
[02:46:07.007 --> 02:46:08.007]  I think it was back in 08.
[02:46:09.686 --> 02:46:11.067]  Hey, what do you mean should have been delivered?
[02:46:11.087 --> 02:46:12.988]  We've only been selling it since last Thursday.
[02:46:13.829 --> 02:46:14.970]  Well, I got what I could.
[02:46:15.010 --> 02:46:16.190]  I got a yard sale going.
[02:46:16.210 --> 02:46:21.814]  I'm getting, I'm buying as much as I can with all the money that I have right now.
[02:46:21.974 --> 02:46:23.535]  Well, listen, brother, you sound fired up.
[02:46:23.555 --> 02:46:25.877]  I'm going to jump to other folks, but God bless you.
[02:46:25.897 --> 02:46:29.039]  Yeah, I know there are all sorts of mutations in plants and animals happening.
[02:46:29.639 --> 02:46:34.922]  Because you've got all this GMO crops that have animal genes, insect genes in them.
[02:46:34.982 --> 02:46:37.144]  It's all sorts of weird mutations are happening.
[02:46:37.744 --> 02:46:39.125]  The government did it to help you though.
[02:46:39.145 --> 02:46:41.547]  They did it because they love you and Al Gore cares about you.
[02:46:42.487 --> 02:46:44.689]  Speaking of nascent iodine, we sold out of it.
[02:46:45.689 --> 02:46:52.493]  But they hadn't delivered it all to us, so I'd forgotten when I said we were sold out that 2,300 bottles or something showed up yesterday.
[02:46:52.833 --> 02:46:54.174]  So we actually have some more now.
[02:46:54.194 --> 02:46:56.295]  We've shipped out almost all the orders that came in.
[02:46:56.855 --> 02:47:00.518]  And then we're going to have more coming in next week, but I have a small shipping crew.
[02:47:00.538 --> 02:47:02.118]  So we're trying to get it all out to you.
[02:47:02.158 --> 02:47:06.021]  It is the amazing Atomic Nation Iodine with all the Fukushima news.
[02:47:06.601 --> 02:47:10.542]  Like they had more AP Reuters news about leaking reactors today.
[02:47:10.962 --> 02:47:21.164]  This is what I did for my family to protect my thyroid because all the scientists and medical doctors, people I talked to said what blows away all the other iodine is the nascent, is the atomic iodine.
[02:47:21.664 --> 02:47:23.684]  Infowarslife.com, we've got it.
[02:47:23.724 --> 02:47:25.224]  I'm glad you brought that up.
[02:47:25.244 --> 02:47:31.025]  You can see a video up there at infowarslife.com that links to the subpage of infowarsstore.com where we cover it all.
[02:47:31.085 --> 02:47:32.225]  Our folks can call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:47:35.606 --> 02:47:37.827]  And your purchase supports the broadcast, so thank you, caller.
[02:47:38.588 --> 02:47:40.629]  Nell in California, you're on the air.
[02:47:40.669 --> 02:47:41.049]  Go ahead.
[02:47:42.910 --> 02:47:44.911]  Nell in California, you're on the air.
[02:47:44.931 --> 02:47:45.292]  Go ahead.
[02:47:46.252 --> 02:47:47.513]  I love you, Alex.
[02:47:47.673 --> 02:47:52.896]  Let me turn off my computer so you can hear me.
[02:47:54.137 --> 02:47:55.117]  I'm a subscriber.
[02:47:55.417 --> 02:47:59.080]  I have fallen in love with InfoWars and GCN, Prison Planet.
[02:47:59.540 --> 02:48:00.780]  I can't get enough of it.
[02:48:01.701 --> 02:48:03.242]  I just watched the broadcast.
[02:48:03.874 --> 02:48:09.776]  That you did with Anthony Gucciardi live at the NSA Utah parking lot confrontation?
[02:48:09.836 --> 02:48:10.316]  Yes, ma'am.
[02:48:10.876 --> 02:48:13.277]  I gotta tell ya, it gave me an adrenaline rush.
[02:48:13.637 --> 02:48:18.598]  It got me so hyped up and so mad, I feel like opening up a can of whoop-ass.
[02:48:19.518 --> 02:48:20.559]  That sounds extremist.
[02:48:22.339 --> 02:48:23.099]  It probably is.
[02:48:23.800 --> 02:48:29.261]  So you like George Washington, you like freedom, you like private property, you don't like the NSA spying on you illegally?
[02:48:29.301 --> 02:48:30.041]  That's extreme.
[02:48:30.601 --> 02:48:32.522]  I know it is, and I'm proud of it.
[02:48:34.580 --> 02:48:39.084]  Listen, I have been paying federal taxes since I was 14 years old.
[02:48:39.325 --> 02:48:41.467]  In Texas, you could work when you were 14.
[02:48:42.908 --> 02:48:50.555]  47 and a half years I've been paying, and because I was so ignorant, I didn't know that I was helping develop a corrupt government.
[02:48:52.757 --> 02:48:53.518]  I've learned now.
[02:48:53.658 --> 02:48:57.522]  Well, we've certainly grown the biggest, most demonic, sickening creature ever seen.
[02:48:57.542 --> 02:48:59.464]  Absolutely.
[02:49:00.231 --> 02:49:03.914]  I didn't know that my rights were being violated and stepped on.
[02:49:04.435 --> 02:49:07.217]  I gotta tell you, I hand it to my brother who lives in Texas.
[02:49:07.277 --> 02:49:13.782]  For a year, over a year, he handed me, you gotta listen, you gotta listen, you gotta listen, coast to coast, go to coast to coast.
[02:49:13.862 --> 02:49:17.425]  That's where I heard you, Alex, the first time I heard you on coast to coast.
[02:49:18.186 --> 02:49:21.168]  I thought, who in the world is this guy?
[02:49:21.188 --> 02:49:23.330]  So I started checking you out.
[02:49:24.201 --> 02:49:27.823]  And there were some rants I listened to, I thought, he needs to be on medication.
[02:49:28.184 --> 02:49:32.106]  But the more I listened to you, you became like family to me.
[02:49:32.747 --> 02:49:35.289]  And you tolerate a lot to get the message.
[02:49:35.469 --> 02:49:36.930]  Well, you tolerate a lot of me, ma'am.
[02:49:37.050 --> 02:49:42.854]  I am crazed and I get very upset about this stuff, so I do act like a fool sometimes, but it doesn't matter.
[02:49:42.974 --> 02:49:47.537]  I'm not the one secretly spying on everybody or putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[02:49:47.837 --> 02:49:50.519]  And we should get crazy angry over what they're doing to us.
[02:49:52.387 --> 02:49:53.568]  I have paid my dues.
[02:49:53.808 --> 02:49:56.090]  I have passed the point of menopause now.
[02:49:56.350 --> 02:49:58.051]  I am standing up now.
[02:49:58.291 --> 02:50:01.513]  I am ready to get loud, get mad.
[02:50:02.013 --> 02:50:11.060]  Instead of hiding behind my computer, trying to be invisible to the NSA and everybody else, I've decided to get radical.
[02:50:11.360 --> 02:50:12.661]  I opened a Twitter account.
[02:50:12.841 --> 02:50:14.382]  I opened a Facebook account.
[02:50:14.502 --> 02:50:15.883]  It says, We Love Alex.
[02:50:15.963 --> 02:50:17.624]  That's who I am on Facebook.
[02:50:18.761 --> 02:50:23.484]  I am going to post and I am going to tweet until my fingertips are raw.
[02:50:23.824 --> 02:50:24.604]  That's exciting.
[02:50:25.005 --> 02:50:25.565]  Absolutely.
[02:50:25.585 --> 02:50:28.447]  The war is on the web and then it manifests physically.
[02:50:28.487 --> 02:50:29.247]  God bless you, ma'am.
[02:50:29.267 --> 02:50:29.927]  Good to hear from you.
[02:50:30.247 --> 02:50:35.230]  I'm going to try to jam in Joshua, Jeff, Kat, Corey, and others.
[02:50:36.291 --> 02:50:41.334]  Actually, Corey's after Joshua, then we'll go to Kat and then Jeff on the other side of this quick break.
[02:50:43.004 --> 02:50:46.407]  I'm usually pretty crazy and exhausted by the third hour, but then I hit my second wind later.
[02:50:46.707 --> 02:50:49.029]  With InfoWars Nightly News, seven o'clock central.
[02:50:49.549 --> 02:50:57.536]  But let me tell you, we are certainly making history together by boldly standing in the face of the tyrants and telling them that we see them.
[02:50:58.236 --> 02:50:59.617]  And we've come here to do two things.
[02:51:00.138 --> 02:51:02.560]  Chew gum and kick New World Order bootay.
[02:51:02.980 --> 02:51:04.781]  And we're all out of bubble gum.
[02:51:05.262 --> 02:51:05.882]  Stay with us.
[02:51:06.303 --> 02:51:07.664]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:14.537 --> 02:51:16.199]  Curious about what comes next?
[02:51:16.960 --> 02:51:23.167]  Next is the feeling of vulnerability you get after you arrive home to discover your house has been ransacked by burglars.
[02:51:23.668 --> 02:51:26.691]  Fool the bad guys with a new improved fake TV.
[02:51:27.032 --> 02:51:33.259]  You asked for it, we listened, and we made our new fake TV three times brighter than our previous model.
[02:51:33.499 --> 02:51:37.122]  The brightness of our new fake TV is equivalent to a 40-inch TV.
[02:51:37.582 --> 02:51:42.386]  It simulates the color and motion of a real TV while you're away from home.
[02:51:42.906 --> 02:51:49.051]  And when burglars think someone is home watching television, they're likely to pass your house and move on to an easier target.
[02:51:49.391 --> 02:51:53.795]  The new, brighter fake TV is only $39.95 and includes free shipping.
[02:51:54.195 --> 02:51:56.797]  Go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[02:51:59.699 --> 02:52:05.843]  That's 877-532-5388 or go to Faketv.com.
[02:52:06.423 --> 02:52:08.905]  Faketv, the burglar deterrent.
[02:52:09.766 --> 02:52:10.526]  My name's Bruno.
[02:52:10.666 --> 02:52:11.747]  I'm 52 years old.
[02:52:12.027 --> 02:52:15.549]  I've tried different protein powders over the years and they've all tasted pretty bad.
[02:52:15.649 --> 02:52:17.711]  I tried One World Way and found it to be delicious.
[02:52:17.931 --> 02:52:23.454]  After 10 weeks on One World Way, my wife commented, you have more muscles and you're leaner than when you were 20 years old.
[02:52:23.875 --> 02:52:25.436]  My body has changed dramatically.
[02:52:25.976 --> 02:52:26.636]  I'm a cyclist.
[02:52:26.896 --> 02:52:29.417]  Normally I'll ride two days on and take two days off.
[02:52:29.918 --> 02:52:39.681]  After being on One World Way, I rode 10 days in a row in over 100 degree heat and then I take another two servings of One World Way and then work out at the gym for another hour and a half.
[02:52:40.042 --> 02:52:41.742]  I just couldn't believe these results.
[02:52:42.222 --> 02:52:45.764]  My normal muscle tightness and soreness after working out are virtually gone.
[02:52:46.424 --> 02:52:47.545]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:52:47.925 --> 02:52:49.545]  One World Way comes in single servings.
[02:52:49.966 --> 02:52:50.846]  Just give it a try.
[02:52:51.451 --> 02:52:54.495]  For a health and taste sensation you'll love, call 888-988-3325.
[02:52:54.535 --> 02:52:54.855]  That's 888-988-3325.

[02:52:57.178 --> 02:52:58.100]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[02:53:10.785 --> 02:53:18.387]  That's the sound of a .44 Magnum and TraumaMaxx, a high-tech hybrid Kevlar bulletproof vest from InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[02:53:18.507 --> 02:53:20.827]  We'll stop it and most pistol rounds.
[02:53:21.008 --> 02:53:27.609]  TraumaMaxx is a major breakthrough in pistol-rated body armor and prices start at just $170 per insert.
[02:53:27.809 --> 02:53:32.870]  More protection, more stopping power, more mobility, and it weighs less than 5 pounds.

[02:54:16.611 --> 02:54:39.500]  You go to DrugsReport.com, you can see the photo of the SWAT team cop with the M16 or M4 laying prone, guarding the capital.
[02:54:42.931 --> 02:54:45.476]  And it says, uh, report officer down.
[02:54:47.339 --> 02:54:50.283]  And continuing orders, stay away from windows.
[02:54:50.864 --> 02:54:54.530]  Lockdown, police shooter in custody, uh, developing.
[02:54:55.746 --> 02:55:00.950]  So, that's the news and the info that we've got right there.
[02:55:00.970 --> 02:55:08.336]  We'll also get that up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, but that is the latest on that.
[02:55:08.996 --> 02:55:10.998]  They make a huge deal out of any type of shooting.
[02:55:11.018 --> 02:55:19.424]  I hope it doesn't turn out to be something big, but I tell you, this is the season for a distraction to change the subject away from Obama because everything he's doing is imploding right now.
[02:55:19.884 --> 02:55:21.766]  Very, very suspicious.
[02:55:21.806 --> 02:55:24.108]  And we know they've staged other things in the past.
[02:55:24.628 --> 02:55:25.989]  They can be staging anything.
[02:55:26.609 --> 02:55:28.250]  Okay, let's go back to the calls.
[02:55:28.310 --> 02:55:29.470]  Joshua in California.
[02:55:32.392 --> 02:55:34.233]  Alex, I'm so freaked out right now.
[02:55:35.293 --> 02:55:36.534]  You were talking about the nukes moving.
[02:55:36.774 --> 02:55:45.938]  I've known for a couple years now that the target was San Francisco, and I didn't know exactly what the details were, but I knew that there was something connected to the movie Star Trek.
[02:55:46.018 --> 02:55:50.720]  Remember how this kind of goes back to like the shooting with the Sandy Hook thing, me and the Batman?
[02:55:51.120 --> 02:55:54.342]  The same thing going on right here, and it's the newer one.
[02:55:55.552 --> 02:55:59.956]  Notice how the bombing is this, it's an archive, you know, supposedly in London, right?
[02:55:59.976 --> 02:56:05.180]  But it's not really London, it's actually San Francisco, and like, if you watch the trailer, you can kind of see the little hints that they're giving here.
[02:56:05.200 --> 02:56:12.625]  And if you remember, the archive wasn't really an archive, it was secretly a government, like, sort of like a database thing.
[02:56:12.765 --> 02:56:20.471]  And the big deal about that being in the Bay Area, that's where like all the YouTube and the Facebook and stuff like that is, which you even talk about how that's the archives.
[02:56:21.669 --> 02:56:35.876]  I did think it looked like they were preparing people for a terror attack on San Francisco in the new Star Trek movie, but Batman specifically, because in the original 60s or 70s Batman, we played the clip, they talk about skull and bones, the Illuminati, and that's really weird.
[02:56:36.836 --> 02:57:02.113]  Batman comes from that's actually in the old original TV show Batman that was so corny and then I noticed in the other ones they were clearly putting programming and they clearly said Sandy Hook this is where the Joker is supposed to attack and then the new one they put stuff like that and it's about the Illuminati staging events to cause a revolution so I know for a fact they're putting programming in for their own people and
[02:57:02.873 --> 02:57:07.499]  Almost like psychopaths always leave cards or mail letters to the police taunting them.
[02:57:08.260 --> 02:57:10.423]  That particular franchise does that.
[02:57:10.823 --> 02:57:12.926]  I don't know if all the franchises are doing it.
[02:57:13.287 --> 02:57:20.356]  I know there's predictive programming in the original Star Trek with the whole UN world government, the UN symbol of the Federation.
[02:57:21.697 --> 02:57:23.879]  Yes sir, you got me?
[02:57:24.059 --> 02:57:24.539]  Yes sir.
[02:57:24.559 --> 02:57:33.785]  Yes sir, I just want to say thank you to you and your field men for getting out there and putting the big targets on your back.
[02:57:34.426 --> 02:57:40.430]  Just like a lot of us veterans have after coming home and listening to the
[02:57:50.615 --> 02:57:52.576]  And I'm saying what our government has to say about us.
[02:57:52.976 --> 02:58:07.545]  And also, with the information that you guys are going out and gathering, if we're senior leadership in the guard, I'm talking officers, senior NCOs, we are talking to our younger troops, we're getting them off the video games as much as we can.
[02:58:07.986 --> 02:58:15.270]  Those guys are going out, they're coming back to the next drill, they're giving us information and feedback with what we've told them to look up and research.
[02:58:15.768 --> 02:58:21.558]  Your movies look up to stuff for themselves about how the globalists are working, the trilateral groups, everything you talk about.
[02:58:21.578 --> 02:58:23.421]  I just want to say thanks again.
[02:58:23.802 --> 02:58:25.645]  And another thing, like the military's waking up.
[02:58:26.181 --> 02:58:37.043]  I'm on the shooting team here in our state, and I made it to the regional shoot, and I was talking to some guys, and I mentioned your names down, and we're down in the pit, shooting, pulling and dropping targets, and all the heads turned, and everybody was nodding up and down.
[02:58:37.443 --> 02:58:43.424]  And then I made it on to the national shoot at the Winston P. Wilson, and we were talking, and pretty soon, everybody... Tell you what, I want to hear this.
[02:58:43.464 --> 02:58:44.584]  We're going into overdrive.
[02:58:44.624 --> 02:58:45.585]  Don't hang up, Corey.
[02:58:46.025 --> 02:58:46.845]  This is exciting.
[02:58:46.865 --> 02:58:48.105]  The military's waking up.
[02:58:48.125 --> 02:58:53.126]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[03:00:00.922 --> 03:00:03.785]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[03:00:04.505 --> 03:00:07.728]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:14.775 --> 03:00:18.956]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:19.597 --> 03:00:20.397]  You want answers?
[03:00:21.197 --> 03:00:22.077]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:22.738 --> 03:00:26.339]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:26.919 --> 03:00:30.980]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:50.791 --> 03:00:53.052]  Alright, final segment, little piece of overdrive here.
[03:00:53.092 --> 03:01:01.555]  I appreciate Corey calling in, and the news he's giving us about a lot of people in the National Guard, regular, big army, all of it being awake is very good.
[03:01:03.475 --> 03:01:15.920]  And, you know, I fall off the handle with the security personnel at the NSA, but only because they're there full well-knowing that they're trying to act like citizen reporters are evil, when we all know who really runs Al Qaeda.
[03:01:16.881 --> 03:01:19.985]  And we all really know the globalists are trying to shut this country down right now.
[03:01:20.105 --> 03:01:24.329]  And we have a real chance at turning things around today.
[03:01:25.230 --> 03:01:31.998]  We have a real chance if we awaken the mass of society to what's happening and to what's going on.
[03:01:32.618 --> 03:01:35.361]  But we have to admit that our government's been captured.
[03:01:36.144 --> 03:01:38.869]  And that they're planning to stage large events, but that was very exciting.
[03:01:39.189 --> 03:01:47.404]  Finishing up there, Corey in North Dakota, you said you were down in the shooting pit and mentioned my name and the heads all turned.
[03:01:47.664 --> 03:01:48.385]  Please continue.
[03:01:50.041 --> 03:01:50.982]  Yes, sir.
[03:01:51.762 --> 03:01:53.463]  You're pretty well known within the military.
[03:01:54.163 --> 03:01:58.745]  A lot of guys are first-time listeners and they're saying, well, he sounds like he's a little bit off the wall.
[03:01:58.765 --> 03:02:00.686]  And I said, you get the guy fired up.
[03:02:00.766 --> 03:02:08.049]  It's no different when you get fired up over something that you don't like or something that you believe and somebody else is saying something against what you feel.
[03:02:08.469 --> 03:02:09.410]  You're going to get fired up.
[03:02:09.910 --> 03:02:13.832]  You need to listen to the content when this man speaks with passion.
[03:02:14.412 --> 03:02:15.253]  Because it is real.
[03:02:15.733 --> 03:02:16.654]  This is not an act.
[03:02:16.774 --> 03:02:20.797]  I've been listening to him for a few years, and it has awakened me.
[03:02:21.237 --> 03:02:22.938]  I'm doing my own research.
[03:02:23.278 --> 03:02:28.202]  To the point to where we take some of my buddies from the unit, we'll come out, we'll play Risk with my sons.
[03:02:28.222 --> 03:02:29.363]  But we don't play Risk normally.
[03:02:29.403 --> 03:02:31.184]  We'll play Risk, and I'll play the New World Order.
[03:02:31.784 --> 03:02:37.068]  And my sons are informing themselves to the point to where they'll call out what we're doing because they've seen it on TV or seen it on the news.
[03:02:38.629 --> 03:02:42.152]  It's pretty sad when a globalist can't even fool a couple of 14-year-old twin boys.
[03:02:43.493 --> 03:02:46.036]  Well, the truth is we're just rediscovering what it is to be free.
[03:02:46.116 --> 03:02:54.105]  If you're not be wearing an out-of-control government or an infiltrated government, if you're not be wearing someone taking your liberties, you will be enslaved.
[03:02:54.425 --> 03:02:58.070]  I mean, Thomas Jefferson said, even if you try to protect it, you're probably not going to keep it.
[03:02:58.669 --> 03:02:59.430]  I mean, that's the thing.
[03:02:59.490 --> 03:03:03.933]  You either aggressively defend your freedom and your individual liberty, or it will be taken.
[03:03:04.254 --> 03:03:15.463]  And special interests, I get chills when I talk about this, have come in and taken over, and everybody just wants to go along to get along, and it's only going to get worse until we wake people up.
[03:03:15.503 --> 03:03:22.889]  But our birthright as a free society is to understand that when anybody says, give up your liberty for security, they're a tyrant.
[03:03:23.189 --> 03:03:23.889]  And God bless you.
[03:03:24.450 --> 03:03:27.973]  And again, folks, statistically, the globalist
[03:03:28.999 --> 03:03:30.460]  No, the military is the biggest threat.
[03:03:30.480 --> 03:03:31.881]  That's why they demonize the military.
[03:03:31.901 --> 03:03:33.422]  And you're like, but they're going to use the military.
[03:03:33.982 --> 03:03:42.308]  It's like Stuart Rhodes came on from Oath Keepers and said we need to get the military, especially retired veterans, to help lead communities to get prepared for an economic collapse.
[03:03:42.368 --> 03:03:45.410]  The Swiss are preparing for economic collapse outside of Switzerland.
[03:03:45.690 --> 03:03:46.831]  They believe it's going to happen.
[03:03:47.051 --> 03:03:48.212]  That was in the news yesterday.
[03:03:48.972 --> 03:03:52.575]  And Stuart Rhodes is flying into town next week to talk about this on air with us.
[03:03:53.780 --> 03:03:54.760]  He's absolutely right.
[03:03:55.001 --> 03:03:59.102]  It really hit me when he was saying that the other day how important this is, that that's their checkmate.
[03:03:59.663 --> 03:04:00.783]  Unless we get ready for it.
[03:04:01.544 --> 03:04:06.726]  But some people were commenting going, why is the military going to be the answer if the military runs for the New World Order?
[03:04:07.206 --> 03:04:08.567]  They don't work for the New World Order.
[03:04:08.887 --> 03:04:10.928]  They're fraudulently under New World Order control.
[03:04:11.368 --> 03:04:13.929]  But imagine if we wake them up, it's over.
[03:04:14.530 --> 03:04:19.072]  Before they get their robots and drones and centralized systems in place.
[03:04:20.177 --> 03:04:22.619]  I apologize to Kat and Jeff and Mike and Chase.
[03:04:22.659 --> 03:04:23.279]  We're out of time.
[03:04:24.120 --> 03:04:25.121]  I can't keep doing overdrive.
[03:04:25.161 --> 03:04:25.761]  I'm exhausted.
[03:04:25.821 --> 03:04:32.086]  I've got to go take a break for about 30 minutes and work on Obama Deception 2 and a bunch of other stuff that's going on.
[03:04:32.766 --> 03:04:38.891]  We're about to upload high def footage in the next hour to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com of my team.
[03:04:39.872 --> 03:04:41.653]  They're in Utah.
[03:04:41.673 --> 03:04:43.054]  We salute them and pray for them.
[03:04:43.755 --> 03:04:46.357]  Going up and covering the NSA, the high def footage of the
[03:04:46.977 --> 03:04:55.642]  of the military taking our cameras, or the NSA private security, I should say, that has military rank, taking the cameras and then thinking they erased the footage.
[03:04:56.122 --> 03:05:04.006]  That's all being uploaded right now, and we'll have that linked up on InfoWars.com in the near future, in the next hour or so.
[03:05:04.066 --> 03:05:06.828]  And more on the nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[03:05:06.848 --> 03:05:07.608]  God bless you all.
[03:05:10.293 --> 03:05:15.877]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[03:05:16.037 --> 03:05:23.262]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[03:05:23.422 --> 03:05:26.684]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[03:05:26.764 --> 03:05:28.545]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[03:05:28.786 --> 03:05:33.329]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[03:05:33.429 --> 03:05:35.290]  Looking to protect my family, I've done it.
[03:05:44.733 --> 03:05:48.862]  Now, this is an amazing deal and you will love the way Real Soap makes
