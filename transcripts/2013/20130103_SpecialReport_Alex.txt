[00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:05.420]  Well, welcome back.
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:12.822]  This past weekend, I had a confrontation with TSA agents both in Austin and in New York City.
[00:00:13.162 --> 00:00:14.502]  We're going to go to that videotape.
[00:00:14.542 --> 00:00:19.704]  It's about 12 minutes in length in a moment, but let me just kind of walk you through this very quickly.
[00:00:19.744 --> 00:00:25.225]  The first clip you're going to see is in Austin, and what you're going to notice, and I'll be speaking over this video as you see it,
[00:00:25.865 --> 00:00:26.125]  Hold on.
[00:00:56.863 --> 00:00:57.743]  Yeah, TSA.
[00:00:57.763 --> 00:01:01.265]  It's on their website you can take.
[00:01:07.128 --> 00:01:08.529]  Completely baffled.
[00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:09.109]  What is that?
[00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:10.930]  These are the rules on the website?
[00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.871]  He's literally looking.
[00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:13.131]  I handed him a sheet of paper.
[00:01:14.552 --> 00:01:15.813]  Here comes Mr. Sunshine.
[00:01:17.773 --> 00:01:18.654]  Watch my camera move.
[00:01:20.382 --> 00:01:20.943]  He pushed it.
[00:01:20.983 --> 00:01:22.704]  Hey, I'm with, I'm just a private citizen.
[00:01:22.884 --> 00:01:23.625]  Okay, that's fine.
[00:01:24.185 --> 00:01:25.807]  Okay, you're a public servant.
[00:01:26.267 --> 00:01:26.807]  Right, right.
[00:01:27.108 --> 00:01:28.269]  Funded by the taxpayers.
[00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.612]  Um, there's a, on the TSA government website... Oh, what's going on?
[00:01:32.732 --> 00:01:33.353]  I'm traveling.
[00:01:33.893 --> 00:01:36.075]  By the way, I'm... That's fine, you can travel.
[00:01:36.355 --> 00:01:36.836]  Yeah, I know.
[00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:39.858]  But you held my hand there for a second.
[00:01:39.878 --> 00:01:41.159]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.561]  I'm not trying to cause trouble, it's just... That's fine.
[00:01:43.781 --> 00:01:45.203]  This is a government agency.
[00:01:45.343 --> 00:01:48.926]  I'm not trying to, you know... And on the website it says that the public's allowed to film.
[00:01:51.256 --> 00:01:53.080]  Because it's funded by taxpayer dollars.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.488]  We need to, you know, keep an eye on the watchmen.
[00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.796]  Who's watching the watchmen, as the saying says.
[00:02:03.433 --> 00:02:04.114]  And I don't mind.
[00:02:04.194 --> 00:02:06.096]  So, let's just stop the video right there.
[00:02:06.436 --> 00:02:17.226]  This is me in New York City, the video that you're about to see, and I was coming back and I said, before I get my bags, let me film the TSA.
[00:02:17.386 --> 00:02:19.568]  We're on public property, they're public servants now.
[00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.150]  I had to go from the back.
[00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.094]  Normally, when you come through the airport, you gotta go the front of the TSA, through the metal detector.
[00:02:26.915 --> 00:02:29.916]  And, um, I came backwards since I was landing.
[00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:33.038]  I came from the back, so that really took them by surprise.
[00:02:33.438 --> 00:02:37.019]  Now, there was a sign that said, do not enter, but I did not see that.
[00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.380]  My head was down and I walked up the ramp.
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.162]  I spoke to the TSA agent and he said, yeah, you can, you can film.
[00:02:43.802 --> 00:02:44.982]  So, uh, I did that.
[00:02:45.623 --> 00:02:51.585]  Um, and, uh, you will see that all Hades breaks loose simply because I came at them from a different angle.
[00:02:51.965 --> 00:02:52.446]  So here we go.
[00:02:52.466 --> 00:02:53.266]  New York City, JFK.
[00:02:54.935 --> 00:02:56.356]  That's what I'm trying to explain to you.
[00:02:56.697 --> 00:03:01.261]  You can take pictures, as long as it's not on my x-rays and things like that.
[00:03:01.801 --> 00:03:04.343]  Because I saw you taking a picture of my x-ray, that's why.
[00:03:06.125 --> 00:03:09.348]  You're facing over there, so that's where my x-ray is.
[00:03:09.368 --> 00:03:12.250]  Ma'am, just out of curiosity, my name is David, I'm a reporter.
[00:03:12.811 --> 00:03:17.275]  This woman has a compelling story, she'll talk about it in a minute before we're interrupted.
[00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.690]  Okay.
[00:03:19.011 --> 00:03:27.344]  Anyway, I'm just asking, do you want to... I saw you arguing with one... I'm not trying to instigate anything, but what was your... I'm recording right now.
[00:03:27.364 --> 00:03:28.004]  This guy right here?
[00:03:28.365 --> 00:03:29.226]  What was I arguing with?
[00:03:29.246 --> 00:03:29.407]  Yeah.
[00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:31.452]  Well, don't point.
[00:03:31.472 --> 00:03:31.832]  Don't point.
[00:03:31.872 --> 00:03:35.135]  I don't want to put up... Hi.
[00:03:35.835 --> 00:03:40.579]  I'm just a little concerned on what you're filming, sir.
[00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:43.362]  Can you just display what you were filming, please?
[00:03:43.482 --> 00:03:44.363]  I'm just filming.
[00:03:44.563 --> 00:03:45.784]  I'm not shooting screens.
[00:03:46.264 --> 00:03:48.666]  Okay, I don't need you to take a picture of me, sir.
[00:03:49.046 --> 00:03:53.150]  Okay, I would like to see what you're filming, because if you're filming the process, you're not allowed to do that.
[00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.951]  Hold on, I've got the... I'm with a...
[00:03:57.802 --> 00:03:58.142]  I'm done.
[00:03:58.202 --> 00:03:58.823]  I just traveled.
[00:03:58.883 --> 00:03:59.543]  I came from Texas.
[00:03:59.563 --> 00:04:00.304]  Can I see your board?
[00:04:00.324 --> 00:04:02.645]  So what are you doing on the checkpoint?
[00:04:02.685 --> 00:04:08.088]  Because... Can you step over this way, please?
[00:04:08.108 --> 00:04:08.508]  Sure.
[00:04:08.528 --> 00:04:11.170]  Step over this way, sir, please.
[00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.691]  Please report.
[00:04:13.011 --> 00:04:14.072]  No, I know.
[00:04:14.092 --> 00:04:16.513]  Can you report for security for me, please?
[00:04:16.613 --> 00:04:17.514]  Yes.
[00:04:17.714 --> 00:04:24.258]  Yes, the calibrations were done.
[00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:28.554]  Sir, I don't need your recording.
[00:04:28.594 --> 00:04:29.634]  This is public property.
[00:04:29.654 --> 00:04:30.214]  This is not.
[00:04:30.374 --> 00:04:30.795]  Yes, it is.
[00:04:30.875 --> 00:04:31.075]  Okay?
[00:04:31.515 --> 00:04:32.375]  I don't need your recording.
[00:04:32.455 --> 00:04:35.736]  And just so you know, I have on the TSA's website, it says that we're allowed to record.
[00:04:35.756 --> 00:04:39.438]  How dare I do that?
[00:04:40.018 --> 00:04:43.259]  Can you step over that way, please?
[00:04:43.299 --> 00:04:46.160]  Just so you know, this is on the website, the TSA website.
[00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.161]  Can you step over that way, please?
[00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:50.381]  You're interfering with screening process.
[00:04:50.421 --> 00:04:51.702]  Can you step over that way, please?
[00:04:51.722 --> 00:04:53.082]  You have no need to be on the channel.
[00:04:53.122 --> 00:04:53.623]  Okay, yeah.
[00:05:02.714 --> 00:05:04.915]  I'm not trying to give you a hard time, but... Well, you are.
[00:05:05.195 --> 00:05:06.336]  Because there's no need to record.
[00:05:06.496 --> 00:05:07.497]  Well, here's why.
[00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:11.279]  Because TSA, they're public servants, paid for by taxpayer dollars.
[00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:16.642]  So as long as we're not getting in the way and interfering with what they're doing, we do have the right... So what is it?
[00:05:16.662 --> 00:05:18.623]  What is your purpose of recording the check right now?
[00:05:19.003 --> 00:05:21.144]  It's part... Well, I'm actually returning from a flight.
[00:05:21.164 --> 00:05:22.425]  I'm about to get my baggage.
[00:05:22.465 --> 00:05:23.885]  Can I have your ID?
[00:05:23.925 --> 00:05:24.086]  No.
[00:05:24.446 --> 00:05:24.606]  Why?
[00:05:25.806 --> 00:05:34.897]  Um, but I, I, I'm coming back from a flight, I'm coming back to New Jersey, and it's part of a national, um, it's called, uh, TSA Opt Out and Film Campaign.
[00:05:35.437 --> 00:05:36.639]  It's a national campaign.
[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.142]  Just so you know, I'm just, you know, I'm not trying to...
[00:05:46.451 --> 00:05:51.034]  Now a cop is going to come very soon and basically... Just so you know, ma'am, I'm not trying to be like adversarial.
[00:05:52.115 --> 00:05:54.757]  TSA is publicly funded, paid for by taxpayer dollars.
[00:05:55.298 --> 00:05:57.039]  So it's no... No problem.
[00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:00.001]  And ma'am, very quickly, I mean, we're on public... Listen to her story.
[00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:00.942]  What was your situation?
[00:06:00.962 --> 00:06:08.928]  I'm not saying that they're... I was upset because they said that the x-ray machine showed something in the bag, in my daughter's bag, and she said it's probably my yogurt.
[00:06:09.648 --> 00:06:14.449]  So he opened up a tied up lunch plastic bag with our sandwiches and he took out the yogurt.
[00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:21.331]  Three dollars each and I was upset that he was going to throw them in the garbage when there are people who don't have any food right here in Far Rockaway.
[00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:26.452]  And he said we could go out, out of security, eat the yogurt and come back.
[00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:28.153]  So I said that's not feasible.
[00:06:28.273 --> 00:06:29.353]  Was the yogurt in your, uh...
[00:06:29.733 --> 00:06:34.937]  It was in a plastic bag inside a backpack and he said the x-ray showed something.
[00:06:35.637 --> 00:06:36.538]  I don't know what it showed.
[00:06:36.578 --> 00:06:43.143]  I felt that if my daughter hadn't said it's probably the yogurt, he would not have possibly opened up the grocery bag with the food in it.
[00:06:43.563 --> 00:06:50.488]  And I think it's ridiculous for these people to get so out of control that they're throwing away yogurts that was my daughter's lunch.
[00:06:51.829 --> 00:06:52.329]  I understand.
[00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.452]  And this kind of thing goes on day after day after day.
[00:06:55.852 --> 00:06:59.115]  Yeah, well just so you know that's... And I saw that you were harassed, too, for no reason.
[00:06:59.715 --> 00:07:01.196]  Yeah, this is... Okay, sir.
[00:07:01.737 --> 00:07:02.077]  Watch.
[00:07:02.217 --> 00:07:02.678]  Turn that off?
[00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:04.979]  Oh, no, that's okay.
[00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:06.581]  Sir, I'm on public property, sir.
[00:07:06.761 --> 00:07:07.962]  You can't video tape, sir.
[00:07:07.982 --> 00:07:08.322]  No, no, no.
[00:07:08.422 --> 00:07:08.662]  Sir?
[00:07:08.862 --> 00:07:09.063]  Sir?
[00:07:09.183 --> 00:07:10.023]  I'm a reporter.
[00:07:10.083 --> 00:07:11.024]  I'm on public property.
[00:07:11.204 --> 00:07:11.985]  Okay, you can't video tape.
[00:07:12.005 --> 00:07:14.107]  Publicly funded... I'm asking you to not video tape.
[00:07:14.127 --> 00:07:15.548]  But I'm on public property.
[00:07:15.768 --> 00:07:16.048]  Okay.
[00:07:16.568 --> 00:07:17.890]  I'm on public property, sir.
[00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.031]  And all we're doing, sir... Officer?
[00:07:20.051 --> 00:07:20.792]  I'm sorry, officer?
[00:07:22.236 --> 00:07:25.177]  Um, all we're doing... Sir, this is perfectly legal.
[00:07:25.197 --> 00:07:26.338]  It's on the TSA's website.
[00:07:26.358 --> 00:07:27.538]  The public is allowed to do this.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:37.403]  It even says on their website right here, we do not prohibit public... Sure, just don't rip it up or anything.
[00:07:37.503 --> 00:07:38.903]  They don't even know their own laws.
[00:07:39.264 --> 00:07:39.584]  Huh?
[00:07:39.764 --> 00:07:39.924]  Huh?
[00:07:39.964 --> 00:07:40.464]  What's this?
[00:07:40.844 --> 00:07:41.665]  Yeah, it's called the law.
[00:07:42.525 --> 00:07:46.487]  Oh!
[00:07:48.368 --> 00:07:49.068]  What's your name, sir?
[00:07:50.347 --> 00:07:51.109]  Why do I have to give that?
[00:07:51.149 --> 00:07:53.032]  I'm not withholding it, but why do I have to give that?
[00:07:53.072 --> 00:07:56.097]  Nah, I'm gonna have to do... I'm gonna have to do pay for it.
[00:07:56.398 --> 00:07:57.099]  Just so you would hear.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.724]  That's all.
[00:08:00.285 --> 00:08:01.286]  Not to be filmed.
[00:08:01.863 --> 00:08:03.803]  No, because you're public servants.
[00:08:03.823 --> 00:08:05.124]  Your salaries come from people.
[00:08:05.564 --> 00:08:06.184]  From the public.
[00:08:06.424 --> 00:08:07.564]  Salaries are the same as yours.
[00:08:07.944 --> 00:08:09.364]  We pay taxes just like you do.
[00:08:09.524 --> 00:08:10.084]  Absolutely.
[00:08:10.104 --> 00:08:10.525]  Exactly.
[00:08:10.605 --> 00:08:16.366]  And you have a right to... Out of all respect for your position, we understand that you don't want to take photos.
[00:08:16.766 --> 00:08:19.246]  There are guidelines that protect you to take photos.
[00:08:19.366 --> 00:08:19.826]  That's fine.
[00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:25.027]  But when it comes to a situation of disrupting the screening process... I never disrupted anything.
[00:08:25.087 --> 00:08:29.528]  I was always... What do you think you're doing now when you have supervisors and managers... I'm being tackled on a public place.
[00:08:29.548 --> 00:08:30.148]  You're not being tackled.
[00:08:30.748 --> 00:08:31.869]  No one is detaining you.
[00:08:32.189 --> 00:08:33.391]  No one is touching you.
[00:08:33.451 --> 00:08:36.053]  All I'm saying to you is, is when it becomes a problem.
[00:08:36.153 --> 00:08:36.994]  It's not a problem.
[00:08:37.154 --> 00:08:38.696]  But who is making that decision?
[00:08:38.976 --> 00:08:39.777]  You or us?
[00:08:40.137 --> 00:08:44.441]  At this point it is becoming a problem because we're telling you that it's distracting our checkpoint.
[00:08:44.781 --> 00:08:47.204]  So at this time, now it's a distraction.
[00:08:47.284 --> 00:08:49.586]  And why is it distracting you if I'm nowhere near it?
[00:08:49.666 --> 00:08:51.428]  Why is it distracting you if I'm nowhere near it?
[00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:54.851]  The dialogue is going on right now for you to continue to get as much footage as you
[00:08:55.031 --> 00:08:57.152]  No, you're just trying to... I'm just saying... I'm just talking.
[00:08:57.172 --> 00:08:57.992]  I'm just trying to talk, sir.
[00:08:58.012 --> 00:08:59.352]  But when are you discontinuing?
[00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:00.433]  When is enough enough?
[00:09:00.813 --> 00:09:01.073]  Why?
[00:09:01.153 --> 00:09:01.753]  Just out of curiosity?
[00:09:01.773 --> 00:09:02.413]  I'm not withholding.
[00:09:02.433 --> 00:09:03.174]  I just like to know why.
[00:09:03.214 --> 00:09:04.034]  I have the same reason.
[00:09:04.094 --> 00:09:05.134]  I just need your information.
[00:09:05.435 --> 00:09:05.755]  That's all.
[00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:06.155]  For why?
[00:09:06.175 --> 00:09:07.895]  I'm not withholding, but why?
[00:09:07.915 --> 00:09:09.536]  Because I need to do a report.
[00:09:10.196 --> 00:09:10.536]  On what?
[00:09:10.556 --> 00:09:11.797]  I'm just a guy standing here.
[00:09:11.817 --> 00:09:16.978]  Because they're calling me, so now a report has to be generated on why I got called.
[00:09:17.038 --> 00:09:19.459]  Okay, I will do it for nothing else out of inconvenience.
[00:09:20.199 --> 00:09:21.880]  This is public property.
[00:09:25.082 --> 00:09:25.605]  Mm-hmm.
[00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:26.107]  Mm-hmm.
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:33.221]  At one point there was a... I'm a public servant, alright?
[00:09:33.241 --> 00:09:37.381]  But I am also a supervisor for the federal government of TSA, alright?
[00:09:37.481 --> 00:09:44.963]  It has already been made as my discretion to sit here and say if you're causing a distraction to the screening process.
[00:09:44.983 --> 00:09:47.063]  But that's your opinion, I may... It's not an opinion!
[00:09:47.103 --> 00:09:47.723]  It's not an opinion.
[00:09:47.763 --> 00:09:53.984]  You might say that when in fact... It's your opinion as a traveling passenger to say what you feel.
[00:09:54.364 --> 00:09:55.424]  How can I be distracting?
[00:09:55.444 --> 00:09:56.845]  Hold on, I heard you, I heard you.
[00:09:56.905 --> 00:09:58.125]  How can I be distracting?
[00:09:59.005 --> 00:10:00.126]  When enough is enough.
[00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:01.067]  Okay.
[00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:02.328]  It's my discretion to say that.
[00:10:02.508 --> 00:10:02.788]  Okay.
[00:10:03.569 --> 00:10:05.850]  But how can I be a distraction when I'm 12 feet away?
[00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:06.831]  Because you're standing here.
[00:10:06.851 --> 00:10:07.231]  Yeah.
[00:10:07.632 --> 00:10:11.675]  And you have all this attention around you, which could be a distraction.
[00:10:11.795 --> 00:10:12.475]  Unnecessary.
[00:10:12.575 --> 00:10:13.336]  Unnecessary.
[00:10:13.356 --> 00:10:16.258]  So you could be distracting us over here for another situation going over there.
[00:10:16.338 --> 00:10:16.939]  I'm filming public service.
[00:10:16.959 --> 00:10:18.119]  I'm filming public service.
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:18.580]  So I don't know.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.681]  If they flip out... Maybe you're part of the threat.
[00:10:20.782 --> 00:10:21.122]  I don't know.
[00:10:23.242 --> 00:10:24.284]  I don't know you.
[00:10:24.445 --> 00:10:26.750]  You're just standing here distracting people.
[00:10:26.991 --> 00:10:28.334]  I'm not distracting, sir.
[00:10:28.354 --> 00:10:30.860]  There was one woman who wanted to talk to me.
[00:10:30.941 --> 00:10:32.003]  She wanted to talk to me.
[00:10:33.396 --> 00:10:34.076]  We're not distracted.
[00:10:34.116 --> 00:10:35.177]  So let me ask you a question.
[00:10:35.477 --> 00:10:35.697]  Yeah.
[00:10:35.957 --> 00:10:37.257]  What time is your flight?
[00:10:37.297 --> 00:10:38.838]  What time is my flight?
[00:10:39.278 --> 00:10:39.958]  I know he is.
[00:10:40.018 --> 00:10:40.498]  I know.
[00:10:40.518 --> 00:10:43.699]  What time is your flight?
[00:10:43.739 --> 00:10:44.380]  What time is your flight?
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:44.820]  He knows that.
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.160]  Um, I didn't see it.
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.041]  Let me tell you something.
[00:10:47.081 --> 00:10:47.641]  No, look at this guy.
[00:10:47.681 --> 00:10:50.622]  You're good up until you pass that sign.
[00:10:50.682 --> 00:10:53.223]  Now, these people pushing the issue, they're not smart enough to know.
[00:10:53.243 --> 00:10:56.644]  If they push the issue, I can lock you up for discount.
[00:10:57.044 --> 00:10:57.304]  Okay.
[00:10:57.364 --> 00:10:57.724]  Okay?
[00:10:57.984 --> 00:10:59.345]  Because you're not supposed to be past that.
[00:10:59.365 --> 00:11:02.786]  But technically, and I'm going to let it go, but technically, technically you can make the argument
[00:11:03.837 --> 00:11:04.998]  You know, it's public property.
[00:11:05.018 --> 00:11:06.778]  I'll tell you what, you'll be making an argument in court.
[00:11:06.938 --> 00:11:08.219]  Right, exactly.
[00:11:08.239 --> 00:11:09.379]  Okay, you won't be making it here.
[00:11:09.459 --> 00:11:10.440]  You'll be making it in court.
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:10.820]  Exactly.
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.140]  With some bracelets on.
[00:11:12.481 --> 00:11:12.881]  Understand?
[00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:14.341]  It's not worth it.
[00:11:14.361 --> 00:11:15.622]  Especially since they have the signpost.
[00:11:15.642 --> 00:11:16.022]  I got it.
[00:11:16.322 --> 00:11:17.063]  They have the signpost.
[00:11:17.083 --> 00:11:20.224]  And another thing is, been through this already, you can film this all you want.
[00:11:20.244 --> 00:11:22.225]  I can still lock you up if you want to do this.
[00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:23.265]  Yeah, you probably could.
[00:11:23.305 --> 00:11:25.526]  The question is, I mean, is that fair?
[00:11:25.546 --> 00:11:26.386]  Do you want to push it?
[00:11:26.867 --> 00:11:28.047]  I don't want to push it.
[00:11:28.067 --> 00:11:28.727]  You don't have to parade.
[00:11:28.747 --> 00:11:30.228]  I'm trying to just have a Thanksgiving dinner.
[00:11:30.268 --> 00:11:30.688]  I'm just talking.
[00:11:30.708 --> 00:11:31.989]  I'll tell you what, it's like this.
[00:11:33.841 --> 00:11:37.163]  Right now, when you passed that, you were breaking the law.
[00:11:37.423 --> 00:11:37.884]  I didn't know that.
[00:11:37.944 --> 00:11:39.985]  I went through over there and I didn't see that.
[00:11:40.286 --> 00:11:40.706]  Guess what?
[00:11:40.726 --> 00:11:47.051]  No, no, but I actually went through clearance to that guy and that guy, and I don't mean to throw anyone under the bus, that guy said you can film as long as... I don't care about them.
[00:11:47.071 --> 00:11:47.812]  They don't work for me.
[00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:48.432]  We're the police.
[00:11:48.452 --> 00:11:49.053]  Well, I don't know.
[00:11:49.133 --> 00:11:49.853]  Nobody was around.
[00:11:49.873 --> 00:11:53.076]  That's all I can refer to is the TSA guy who said... Well, I'm referring it to you now.
[00:11:53.416 --> 00:11:53.656]  Okay.
[00:11:53.736 --> 00:11:56.078]  Honestly, shut your joint off.
[00:11:56.098 --> 00:11:59.060]  Okay, I'm not shutting this off right here.
[00:12:00.181 --> 00:12:01.562]  I will go back to pick up my bags.
[00:12:01.582 --> 00:12:02.023]  I'll tell you what.
[00:12:03.732 --> 00:12:04.893]  You want to play semantics?
[00:12:06.534 --> 00:12:08.815]  He just told me, he just said I could use my camera out here.
[00:12:09.756 --> 00:12:10.757]  Where were you using the camera?
[00:12:10.797 --> 00:12:11.477]  Up there, right?
[00:12:12.358 --> 00:12:13.418]  Yeah, but I didn't know.
[00:12:13.438 --> 00:12:14.839]  I was told by TSH and I could.
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.462]  Listen, not knowing doesn't save you.
[00:12:19.342 --> 00:12:20.603]  I mean, there's no entry sign.
[00:12:21.163 --> 00:12:21.864]  That you passed.
[00:12:21.884 --> 00:12:23.445]  No, right there.
[00:12:23.465 --> 00:12:24.946]  That you passed on both sides.
[00:12:25.106 --> 00:12:25.946]  Okay.
[00:12:26.587 --> 00:12:29.128]  So you want to keep this happening?
[00:12:30.229 --> 00:12:31.330]  Do you really want to push it?
[00:12:35.669 --> 00:12:37.391]  I'm going to walk down to the baggage claim.
[00:12:38.332 --> 00:12:39.233]  Not right now.
[00:12:39.654 --> 00:12:40.875]  I'm not going to walk to the baggage claim.
[00:12:40.936 --> 00:12:42.097]  You really want to push this?
[00:12:42.397 --> 00:12:43.939]  Why are you acting like that?
[00:12:43.959 --> 00:12:46.002]  First of all, it says no entry.
[00:12:46.042 --> 00:12:48.204]  It doesn't say if you don't enter, it's illegal.
[00:12:48.465 --> 00:12:48.785]  Stop.
[00:12:49.326 --> 00:12:50.327]  It says no entry.
[00:12:50.447 --> 00:12:52.189]  Stop the performance, okay?
[00:12:52.229 --> 00:12:52.430]  Stop.
[00:12:53.343 --> 00:12:54.745]  I'm not the one performing, man.
[00:12:54.825 --> 00:12:56.767]  I'm just, I'm ready to go to the baggage claim right now.
[00:12:56.807 --> 00:12:57.928]  You notice where my voice is?
[00:12:58.149 --> 00:12:59.590]  Notice I'm not yelling, I'm not screaming.
[00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:00.732]  Yeah, but you're being kind of stiff.
[00:13:00.752 --> 00:13:01.933]  You're being kind of condescending.
[00:13:02.253 --> 00:13:04.636]  I'm ready to go down to the baggage claim.
[00:13:04.696 --> 00:13:05.057]  I'm ready to go.
[00:13:05.077 --> 00:13:06.338]  I'm being kind of condescending.
[00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:06.899]  Alright.
[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:08.160]  Have a nice day.
[00:13:14.688 --> 00:13:16.869]  Listen to what they say about pat-downs.
[00:13:16.889 --> 00:13:20.271]  The camera's gonna have to go inside?
[00:13:20.331 --> 00:13:22.212]  I'm gonna do a pat-down, but I don't know.
[00:13:22.752 --> 00:13:25.994]  They told me that technically I could film the pat-down if I wanted to.
[00:13:26.195 --> 00:13:28.856]  I'm gonna opt out so I don't go through the machine.
[00:13:29.136 --> 00:13:30.857]  But you won't be able to film the pat-down.
[00:13:31.418 --> 00:13:32.338]  I can't film the pat-down?
[00:13:32.358 --> 00:13:33.599]  You cannot.
[00:13:33.619 --> 00:13:34.379]  They told me I could.
[00:13:34.419 --> 00:13:35.040]  Who's they?
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.060]  It was on the website.
[00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.121]  It's the SA website.
[00:13:37.321 --> 00:13:39.943]  Not to film that, so let me ask... You can't?
[00:13:48.263 --> 00:13:55.289]  I don't believe you can, sir.
[00:13:55.389 --> 00:13:58.812]  I will find out for you and make sure, okay?
[00:13:58.912 --> 00:13:59.092]  Yeah.
[00:13:59.132 --> 00:14:00.613]  Can you take your sweatshirt off?
[00:14:00.733 --> 00:14:02.295]  My sweatshirt?
[00:14:02.375 --> 00:14:02.515]  No.
[00:14:02.575 --> 00:14:04.556]  Not my sweatshirt.
[00:14:04.656 --> 00:14:06.318]  It's gonna create a bomb, I guess.
[00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:09.871]  So there you go.
[00:14:10.271 --> 00:14:12.092]  My sweatshirt's gonna create a bomb.
[00:14:12.492 --> 00:14:17.993]  Um, you know, they said, I think that one officer said that not knowing the law is not an excuse.
[00:14:18.013 --> 00:14:22.275]  Well, if that's the case, officer, you should be locked up because you were arguing with TSA agents.
[00:14:23.175 --> 00:14:24.555]  Um, it's just such a joke.
[00:14:25.155 --> 00:14:27.416]  Um, these are publicly funded individuals.
[00:14:28.056 --> 00:14:30.777]  An airport is a publicly funded location.
[00:14:30.817 --> 00:14:35.380]  You have every right in the world to film them, as long as you don't film the monitors.
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.340]  The problem is, they get you.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.561]  There are monitors everywhere.
[00:14:38.701 --> 00:14:42.963]  So if you move your camera 6 inches to the left, 6 inches to the right, they'll get you that way.
[00:14:43.683 --> 00:14:44.644]  But, you know, there you go.
[00:14:44.824 --> 00:14:46.104]  You saw some of that video.
[00:14:46.144 --> 00:14:48.045]  I was about 30 seconds from getting locked up.
[00:14:48.345 --> 00:14:51.227]  They were going to come up with some cocky namey law to arrest me.
[00:14:51.787 --> 00:14:53.208]  But, um, there you go.
[00:14:53.408 --> 00:14:55.289]  She said you can't even film the pat-downs.
[00:14:56.189 --> 00:14:57.632]  So that's pretty amazing.
[00:14:58.714 --> 00:15:01.179]  So there you go, and what am I hearing in the earpiece here?
[00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:13.733]  Okay, so that's all for right now, and we're going to move over to a segment with Aaron Dykes, with a gentleman by the name of Mr. Miller.
[00:15:14.553 --> 00:15:17.074]  He is going to talk about police brutality.
[00:15:17.134 --> 00:15:22.315]  He has a very powerful website where there are many videos that talk about police brutality.
[00:15:22.335 --> 00:15:32.198]  We're not saying all officers are bad, many officers are heroes, but there is a large minority of them that are thugs with badges, and Aaron Dykes is going to talk about that in just a minute.
