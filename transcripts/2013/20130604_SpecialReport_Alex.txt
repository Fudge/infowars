[00:00:08.157 --> 00:00:11.059]  The Google Gestapo is coming to a city near you.
[00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:16.802]  That's right, right now they are marching across Europe, between Lithuania, Britain, even Greece.
[00:00:17.542 --> 00:00:23.926]  Google, Street View, and the local tax authorities have partnered up to catch citizens who might be evading taxes.
[00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:31.352]  In fact, the Lithuanian tax office has created their own iPhone app so that citizens can easily report on each other.
[00:00:31.673 --> 00:00:37.078]  The Lithuanian tax inspectorate says, we realized we could do more with less and in a shorter time.
[00:00:37.598 --> 00:00:42.502]  Hundreds of thousands of dollars are being collected out of an already cash-strapped European public.
[00:00:43.365 --> 00:00:49.370]  Last year, over 2,500 citizens turned in other citizens for tax evasion.
[00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:54.475]  So, this brings a whole new meaning to see something, say something.
[00:00:55.156 --> 00:00:58.218]  Look out, the Google Gestapo is coming to a city near you.
