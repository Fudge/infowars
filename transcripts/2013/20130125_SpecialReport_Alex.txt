[00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.130]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:00:07.051 --> 00:00:14.114]  Fellow freedom lovers, Alex Jones here with the biggest contest announcement we've ever made.
[00:00:14.654 --> 00:00:17.295]  This is so incredibly exciting.
[00:00:17.435 --> 00:00:21.096]  We are launching Operation Paul Revere.
[00:00:22.048 --> 00:00:23.109]  What did Paul Revere do?
[00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:31.457]  He rode through the countryside in New England saying, to arms, to arms, the Redcoats are coming.
[00:00:31.777 --> 00:00:33.359]  Wanteth by land, toeth by sea.
[00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:38.263]  And all that evil men and tyrancy deflourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[00:00:38.443 --> 00:00:40.085]  Let me officially announce
[00:00:40.465 --> 00:00:43.408]  Operation Paul Revere.
[00:00:43.808 --> 00:00:51.055]  A $100,000 cash first place winner to be judged by yours truly, Alex Jones.
[00:00:51.475 --> 00:00:54.538]  The film can be three minutes, it can be up to two hours.
[00:00:54.638 --> 00:00:58.321]  It can be fiction, non-fiction, documentary, drama.
[00:00:58.761 --> 00:01:00.243]  It's got to promote liberty,
[00:01:00.703 --> 00:01:00.943]  I think so.
[00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:22.449]  $5,000 third place.
[00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:43.643]  But just as I did last year with a reporter contest, we are going to crowdsource from the pool of incredible talent out there and hire several official crews to be directors and writers and camera people in InfoWars.com produced major films and documentaries that will be put in movie theaters and on cable.
[00:01:43.863 --> 00:01:45.685]  And I've got all the connections to get it done.
[00:01:45.885 --> 00:01:48.246]  Together, we're going to really give the New World Order hell.
[00:01:48.527 --> 00:01:49.647]  This is extremely exciting.
[00:01:49.907 --> 00:01:50.488]  I've made over 20 films.
[00:01:51.188 --> 00:01:54.231]  One of them alone has reached more than 40 million people on YouTube and Google Video.
[00:01:54.492 --> 00:01:57.975]  The Obama Deception, Endgame, Fall of the Republic, Road to Tyranny.
[00:01:59.096 --> 00:02:02.520]  Films are the most effective thing I do, but they're very time-consuming.
[00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:07.064]  And so I want to turn the power of We the People loose here.
[00:02:07.124 --> 00:02:11.709]  And your art, your research, your ideas are unstoppable.
[00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:14.211]  We're officially kicking the contest off.
[00:02:14.992 --> 00:02:16.093]  This Friday.
[00:02:16.113 --> 00:02:20.174]  And you've got a little more than three months until April 30th.
[00:02:20.214 --> 00:02:26.397]  Just a little more than three months to produce your documentary or your film and get it out.
[00:02:26.597 --> 00:02:30.039]  And it will absolutely reach tens of millions of people.
[00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:32.520]  Our normal contests get about 500 entries.
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.180]  That's what $10,000 prize is.
[00:02:34.581 --> 00:02:35.621]  This is 10 times that.
[00:02:35.981 --> 00:02:37.642]  $100,000 for first place.
[00:02:37.742 --> 00:02:39.463]  That's one of the biggest contests out there.
[00:02:40.023 --> 00:02:43.046]  In fact, it's the biggest next to Doritos that has $100,000.
[00:02:43.906 --> 00:02:46.048]  This is huge, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:46.128 --> 00:02:53.615]  $115,000 in cash prizes and a shot to have your film produced and financed by InfoWars.com.
[00:02:53.795 --> 00:03:03.043]  Edit it, upload it to YouTube and one other alternate public video site and send your entry to PaulRevere at InfoWars.com.
[00:03:03.203 --> 00:03:08.726]  The animating contest of liberty that Thomas Jefferson talked about is happening right now.
[00:03:09.166 --> 00:03:12.527]  The modern battlefield is in the mind more than ever.
[00:03:12.807 --> 00:03:15.589]  We use truth, the globalists use lies and deception.
[00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:19.511]  The corruption and oppression and high-tech police state is in our face.
[00:03:19.911 --> 00:03:21.271]  But the controllers are scared.
[00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:25.013]  They intended to use the internet to dominate and control humanity and surveil us.
[00:03:25.273 --> 00:03:27.394]  But we've turned their system against them.
[00:03:27.794 --> 00:03:30.996]  This is a historic crossroads that we have reached.
[00:03:31.636 --> 00:03:39.341]  And I asked you to ride in the year 2013 just as one of the founders of this republic did back in 1775.
[00:03:40.022 --> 00:03:47.567]  I'm calling you to arms in the Info War because the pen and the video camera is mightier than the sword.
[00:03:47.807 --> 00:03:50.149]  Let's go in there and rescue humanity.
[00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.294]  And awaken them and set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:03:54.594 --> 00:03:55.675]  Be part of this contest.
[00:03:55.776 --> 00:03:56.697]  You've got three months.
[00:03:57.037 --> 00:03:58.139]  Put your hat in the ring.
[00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:01.222]  Be part of the solution to the corruption and oppression.
[00:04:01.583 --> 00:04:03.766]  Be part of the resistance to tyranny.
[00:04:03.806 --> 00:04:09.393]  We're looking for the Paul Reveres that will drive a stake through the New World Order's wicked heart.
