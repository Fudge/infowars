[00:00:15.894 --> 00:00:25.584]  If you fly over these areas that are burned to the ground, you'll see in the midst of 20 homes that are just totally destroyed, one home sitting there because they have the right roof on it.
[00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:32.971]  The roofs, they didn't move.
[00:00:35.703 --> 00:00:37.923]  Joe Biden's recent comments are alarming.
[00:00:38.364 --> 00:00:43.965]  The average person... Joe Biden's recent comments are alarming.
[00:00:44.425 --> 00:00:47.385]  The average person isn't supposed to know that the U.S.
[00:00:47.445 --> 00:00:55.107]  and Chinese military have been testing field-ready ground and space-based DEWS, or directed energy weapons, for at least a decade.
[00:00:55.467 --> 00:01:01.888]  Instead, we are supposed to sit down and shut up and believe it is a Jewish space laser conspiracy theory.
[00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:10.177]  Can you tell me why so many people that support Donald Trump love conspiracy theories, including yourself, about Jewish space lasers?
[00:01:10.397 --> 00:01:12.099]  Tell us about Jewish space lasers.
[00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:15.022]  No, why don't you go talk about Jewish space lasers?
[00:01:15.082 --> 00:01:16.063]  And really, why don't you f*** off?
[00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:18.260]  According to the U.S.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:27.231]  Government Accountability Office, directed energy weapons can produce force that ranges from deterrent to damaging to destructive.
[00:01:27.571 --> 00:01:30.875]  Many countries, including the U.S., are researching their use.
[00:01:31.195 --> 00:01:35.260]  Different types of electromagnetic energy have different properties.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:45.668]  High-energy lasers produce a very narrow beam of light, usually in the infrared to visible region, and are typically used on one target at a time.
[00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:52.234]  The beam can be pulsed or continuous, generating a power output of at least 1 kilowatt.
[00:01:52.334 --> 00:01:59.300]  This output is 200,000 times greater than a typical laser pointer and is capable of melting steel.
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.063]  These things pulse at different frequencies to optimize the damage.
[00:02:03.383 --> 00:02:07.446]  Evidence of a CCP satellite over Maui is known.
[00:02:07.606 --> 00:02:09.668]  There's three fires on the Maui Island.
[00:02:09.688 --> 00:02:13.190]  The first one that happened was on August 7, the Olinda fire.
[00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.951]  That was a big one.
[00:02:14.191 --> 00:02:16.613]  And then what happened after that was the Lahaina fire.
[00:02:16.833 --> 00:02:19.255]  That was the nasty one that killed all those people.
[00:02:19.655 --> 00:02:23.758]  And the third one was the Kula fire, which happened after the Lahaina fire.
[00:02:23.798 --> 00:02:27.161]  So there's three blasts and two satellites, basically.
[00:02:27.441 --> 00:02:33.083]  Three shots and three or two satellites is just too much of a coincidence for it not to be a deal basically.
[00:02:33.283 --> 00:02:38.204]  As is the phenomenon of the lasers being unable to ignite the color blue.
[00:02:38.484 --> 00:02:39.925]  And also the blue factor too.
[00:02:40.685 --> 00:02:46.407]  I calculate this as a near-infrared or near-spectrum and that's why it's not damaging blue colors.
[00:02:46.867 --> 00:02:52.130]  That is overwhelming evidence that should be admissible in a court of law.
[00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.932]  In China, the CCP now is just releasing data on their petawatt lasers.
[00:02:56.213 --> 00:02:59.975]  They're doing petawatt laser bursts on a laser that fits on a lab table.
[00:03:00.035 --> 00:03:01.936]  It's not a very big laser, basically.
[00:03:02.016 --> 00:03:06.739]  But when you have lasers of this energy, it's just instant damage.
[00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:08.600]  Very, very powerful lasers.
[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:20.971]  Some extraordinary damage in our state could be caused by hurricanes or tornadoes and frequently when you see the aftermath of that damage, there's a some semblance of a structure that is still there.
[00:03:21.232 --> 00:03:25.516]  When you look at the damages that have occurred here, it's just gone.
[00:03:25.916 --> 00:03:26.757]  Completely gone.
[00:03:26.837 --> 00:03:46.494]  And as we realize that the government is, at the very least, complicit in the COVID vaccine genocide, what makes you think that they wouldn't use dues, supported by lawfare, to drive people off their land, to cordon the population into smart cities, in order to quicken the United Nations Agenda 2030?
[00:03:46.654 --> 00:03:49.657]  It's not something you see every day.
[00:03:50.097 --> 00:03:51.158]  Oh, geez, it was soft.
[00:03:51.838 --> 00:03:52.879]  I mean, it went back and forth.
[00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:55.860]  At least, I would say 40 minutes to an hour.
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.582]  But for people living in Cape Coral, they've been seeing it a lot this week.
[00:03:59.602 --> 00:04:00.803]  It was really late at night.
[00:04:00.883 --> 00:04:02.124]  It was kind of around midnight.
[00:04:02.404 --> 00:04:05.245]  It was around midnight, and I was actually in my car.
[00:04:05.726 --> 00:04:11.769]  I was just getting home, and I saw it going back and forth with a laser beam, and it scanned over me multiple times.
[00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:13.810]  And it was just moving.
[00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.492]  It was scanning the whole area, every square footage, basically.
[00:04:17.652 --> 00:04:18.573]  When it came by,
[00:04:26.239 --> 00:04:34.987]  When you put the information Casey provided into the FAA website, it comes back with this information saying it's registered to Randigo LLC.
[00:04:35.468 --> 00:04:38.591]  But it's unclear who or what they're doing.
[00:04:38.871 --> 00:04:40.232]  We just want to know what's going on.
[00:04:40.292 --> 00:04:41.853]  Why are we being scanned?
[00:04:42.193 --> 00:04:49.839]  Furthermore, wouldn't a covert satellite-based laser weapon in concert with known weather modifications...
[00:05:01.226 --> 00:05:02.548]  Please remember, we're lusciously supportive.

[00:05:47.228 --> 00:05:47.988]  Nitric Boost.

[00:05:59.115 --> 00:05:59.515]  Be right back.
[00:06:11.175 --> 00:06:15.677]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones!
[00:06:16.897 --> 00:06:32.083]  Well, we are now in the thick of the battle!
[00:06:40.276 --> 00:06:58.771]  And I'm just blessed and honored that all the supporters of this broadcast, from Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan to the people of America and the world, and the great crew have kept us on air to still be here at this critical time, eight and a half months out of the most important election in world history.
[00:07:00.692 --> 00:07:03.975]  Wow, a lot going on, ladies and gentlemen, a lot going on.
[00:07:05.788 --> 00:07:13.394]  All over the Western world, they've defunded the police, but they've increased the police for spying and arresting people and censorship of citizens.
[00:07:15.015 --> 00:07:16.296]  But none of your daughter gets raped.
[00:07:16.997 --> 00:07:18.498]  Not if somebody breaks in your house.
[00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:21.380]  And if you offend yourself, you go to jail.
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.422]  So we saw the National Guard put into the Newark subway last week.
[00:07:25.523 --> 00:07:29.226]  And the governor, she's basically nationalized things, she's put an emergency in.
[00:07:31.508 --> 00:07:32.669]  Each state's its own little nation.
[00:07:34.013 --> 00:07:36.456]  And said, hey, if you don't want to be searched, don't go on the subway.
[00:07:37.156 --> 00:07:40.980]  So, Alvin Bragg and Leticia James let all the violent criminals out of jail.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.562]  This is the model for the rest of the country and the world.
[00:07:43.282 --> 00:07:52.252]  And when you defend yourself, you go to prison, and then you find the police and charge them when they do their job, and everything collapses, then you send in the troops, and everybody loses their rights.
[00:07:54.053 --> 00:07:56.296]  And people are really getting this now.
[00:07:57.261 --> 00:08:02.124]  There's been decades of preparation for it, and I was a voice in the wilderness exposing it, but now it's everywhere.
[00:08:02.144 --> 00:08:10.488]  So I'm going to direct your attention to local television, mainstream media, Channel 11 in Pittsburgh.
[00:08:11.269 --> 00:08:17.772]  Police will no longer respond to certain calls including theft, harassment, criminal mischief, and burglary alarms.
[00:08:18.433 --> 00:08:20.354]  So it's like The Purge, it's just wide open crime.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:29.023]  There'll be 20 police officers on the shift, and the police chief tries to spin it from midnight to 6 a.m.
[00:08:29.483 --> 00:08:34.905]  The police chief tries to spin it, like, well, we don't need police then.
[00:08:35.405 --> 00:08:44.089]  Then they admit it's because of defunding and the police not wanting to be sent to prison, because Cleveland's controlled, Pittsburgh's controlled, that whole area.
[00:08:45.049 --> 00:08:45.849]  Every major city.
[00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.551]  Every major city is controlled by Soros operatives.
[00:08:51.019 --> 00:08:54.141]  Austin's has like half the police it needs.
[00:08:55.161 --> 00:08:56.182]  It's the same everywhere.
[00:08:57.302 --> 00:09:00.764]  So this is all part of the angrier world, all part of the collapsed civilization here it is.
[00:09:07.558 --> 00:09:13.523]  In the way police respond, they will no longer respond to calls that aren't considered in progress emergency.
[00:09:14.203 --> 00:09:21.428]  That means calls like criminal mischief, theft, harassment, and most burglary alarms will all be handled by an enhanced telephone reporting unit.
[00:09:21.468 --> 00:09:24.751]  That means residents will file a police report over the phone.
[00:09:25.191 --> 00:09:27.752]  Officers will not respond unless it's an emergency.
[00:09:28.312 --> 00:09:30.352]  Also, between the hours of 3 a.m.
[00:09:30.392 --> 00:09:34.513]  and 7 a.m., there will be no officers at any of the six stations throughout the city.
[00:09:34.834 --> 00:09:39.655]  Call boxes that link directly to 911 have been installed for people to use in case of an emergency.
[00:09:40.035 --> 00:09:44.836]  And during the overnight shift, there will be as few as 20 officers to cover the entire city.
[00:09:45.236 --> 00:09:47.757]  The chief said today the data supports that.
[00:09:49.608 --> 00:09:56.992]  Yes, it's enough to cover the entire city in those hours when we have 8% of the time people are calling.
[00:09:57.252 --> 00:10:05.897]  I'm confident in the decisions that we make that it impacts this bureau and the city in a much better way than we have in the past.
[00:10:06.909 --> 00:10:10.874]  Now the chief also acknowledging today that some of these changes are due to staffing shortages.
[00:10:11.314 --> 00:10:15.419]  He's down to 740 officers, well below the 850 they would like to have.
[00:10:15.779 --> 00:10:22.206]  Now coming up new at 5, residents, city council, and the police union all weighing in on these big changes that begin Monday.
[00:10:22.627 --> 00:10:24.689]  Live in the studio, Rick Earle, Channel 11 News.
[00:10:27.639 --> 00:10:28.780]  They're going to search bags?
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.120]  Randomly.
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.061]  Randomly.
[00:10:31.841 --> 00:10:33.842]  What happens if you don't want your bag searched?
[00:10:34.303 --> 00:10:34.983]  Then go home.
[00:10:35.924 --> 00:10:36.924]  We're not going to search you.
[00:10:36.964 --> 00:10:39.626]  You can say no, but you're not taking the subway.
[00:10:41.767 --> 00:10:44.568]  Alright, so this is the plan.
[00:10:45.309 --> 00:10:46.649]  It's been done all over the Western world.
[00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:47.650]  We're living it now.
[00:10:49.111 --> 00:10:56.475]  So all over the country, the Democrats are trying to take your guns and charging you if you defend yourself.
[00:10:59.246 --> 00:11:02.328]  While they defund the police, what happened in Minnesota, Minneapolis and St.
[00:11:02.368 --> 00:11:03.069]  Paul a few years ago?
[00:11:03.769 --> 00:11:16.859]  They defunded the police by half, crime exploded, and then the city council in both cities, in multi-million dollar contracts, hired 24-hour security for the city council.
[00:11:17.239 --> 00:11:18.180]  Private security.
[00:11:21.022 --> 00:11:22.683]  They could have hired dozens of cops for that.
[00:11:23.764 --> 00:11:25.004]  But that's how they work.
[00:11:26.065 --> 00:11:28.127]  And if you don't see how transparent it is,
[00:11:29.465 --> 00:11:33.468]  Well then I guess in a way you deserve, you deserve what's happening to you.
[00:11:33.488 --> 00:11:40.132]  I mean it's like this, they're cutting off the oil, they're cutting off the gas, they're cutting off the coal, and there's all these headlines.
[00:11:40.412 --> 00:11:41.673]  We don't have enough power now!
[00:11:42.334 --> 00:11:48.478]  There's going to be power outages, you'll pay way more, and then people have a disconnect where they don't say, well what are the policies that did that?
[00:11:50.119 --> 00:11:58.725]  Are you going to put up with all these Soros prosecutors that let criminals out of jail?
[00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:15.163]  And then you've got Biden apologizing to the illegal alien who murdered that woman in Georgia because he called the illegal alien illegal.
[00:12:16.825 --> 00:12:22.289]  I already played that clip last night, but this is just absolutely stunning that this is going on.
[00:12:22.329 --> 00:12:25.432]  Now we have a guest coming up.
[00:12:27.532 --> 00:12:34.036]  In the third hour, the great Robert Barnes on the lawfare, the persecution of Trump, the American people and what's happening.
[00:12:34.456 --> 00:12:52.526]  But I want to open the phones up in the first and second hour today for first-time callers to talk about any subject, anything you want to discuss, anything you want.
[00:12:53.513 --> 00:12:54.153]  To get into.
[00:12:55.034 --> 00:12:56.174]  Now you gotta love the Oscars.
[00:12:56.214 --> 00:12:57.074]  Almost no ratings.
[00:12:57.714 --> 00:12:58.755]  Almost no one tuning in.
[00:12:58.775 --> 00:13:03.536]  So they have the Islamists protesting it and blocking roads, which is all part of the stage deal.
[00:13:04.177 --> 00:13:07.378]  Hoping that that gets more viewers.
[00:13:07.418 --> 00:13:09.118]  They got naked guys on stage.
[00:13:09.178 --> 00:13:09.899]  It's all a joke.
[00:13:10.519 --> 00:13:15.361]  And then Jimmy Kimmel comes after Trump and says, isn't it past your jail time?
[00:13:17.481 --> 00:13:19.082]  Then you have Robert De Niro on
[00:13:21.158 --> 00:13:24.682]  Bill Maher Friday saying, oh, Trump's going to arrest all of us.
[00:13:24.742 --> 00:13:28.465]  So paradoxically, Trump didn't arrest anybody who were up for political opposition.
[00:13:30.087 --> 00:13:30.968]  But let's get the clips ready.
[00:13:31.008 --> 00:13:34.611]  We've got Jimmy Kimmel saying, ha ha ha, aren't you supposed to be in jail right now?
[00:13:34.631 --> 00:13:41.058]  And then you've got Robert De Niro saying, Trump's going to take us off the air and arrest us and come after us.
[00:13:41.518 --> 00:13:42.459]  Get both clips ready.
[00:13:46.087 --> 00:13:48.188]  Everything they're saying we're going to do to them.
[00:13:48.468 --> 00:14:08.592]  We just want to turn the energy back on, turn the due process back on, turn the police back on, turn the border back on, turn stabilization of the country back on, not have one-sided trade deals, not have the Feds in thousands of raids a year on Amish and Mennonites and organic farms.
[00:14:08.752 --> 00:14:14.794]  I mean, the government is literally cutting off our food just like the Netherlands, just like Ireland, just like everywhere else.
[00:14:16.072 --> 00:14:16.752]  The crew in there.
[00:14:16.772 --> 00:14:20.674]  We don't always take calls, so there's folks that take the phone lines.
[00:14:21.815 --> 00:14:28.058]  Get them in there, because in a few minutes I'm going to give out the toll-free number, and we're going to take your phone calls here today.
[00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:42.484]  Now, separately, there has been a lot of talk about me on Tucker Carlson last Thursday night, and then again Sunday, telling you that InfoWars has never been in more peril.
[00:14:42.744 --> 00:14:43.685]  But so has the whole country.
[00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:46.191]  And people say, well, what does that entail?
[00:14:47.452 --> 00:14:57.601]  The Democrat Party plaintiffs and their rigged lawsuits and their rigged courts and their law fair and then finding me guilty with no jury and then telling the jury to find out how guilty I am.
[00:14:59.122 --> 00:15:08.430]  They said on the courthouse steps, and I played the clips probably 50 times, won't play it again, that we don't want money from Alex Jones.
[00:15:09.891 --> 00:15:11.052]  We want him off the air.
[00:15:11.252 --> 00:15:12.974]  And so far they've made true on that.
[00:15:14.415 --> 00:15:23.439]  And they have continued in the Federal Bankruptcy Court to not be reasonable and not settle.
[00:15:24.559 --> 00:15:28.541]  And so what a judge does is they do a Chapter 7 and shut the company down, liquidate it.
[00:15:28.861 --> 00:15:30.062]  Now, they're not going to stop me.
[00:15:30.082 --> 00:15:34.364]  I'm going to go and do my show and intensify it.
[00:15:34.444 --> 00:15:35.044]  I don't want that to happen.
[00:15:35.064 --> 00:15:36.905]  I love my crew, love our infrastructure.
[00:15:36.925 --> 00:15:37.345]  We'll keep it here.
[00:15:39.571 --> 00:15:42.553]  But that's a reality, so I have to talk about that with you.
[00:15:42.814 --> 00:15:48.478]  And the Justice Department, a year and a half ago, when I first declared bankruptcy, was crazy enough to send an email.
[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:53.142]  The Justice Department's involved, if they want to, in federal bankruptcies.
[00:15:53.963 --> 00:15:54.784]  They're all federal.
[00:15:56.045 --> 00:16:01.509]  And they said, Alex Jones will never... What was the exact quote in the document?
[00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:04.692]  "...will never overcome us.
[00:16:04.812 --> 00:16:06.393]  He will not be afforded bankruptcy."
[00:16:07.374 --> 00:16:08.014]  Okay, great.
[00:16:08.959 --> 00:16:11.621]  You think I care you harass me and harass my family?
[00:16:11.962 --> 00:16:15.625]  My family has told me, we don't like how nice you're being.
[00:16:15.985 --> 00:16:17.266]  We don't care what they do to us.
[00:16:18.127 --> 00:16:20.929]  Come home with your shield or on it.
[00:16:23.211 --> 00:16:24.612]  My mother told me that a month ago.
[00:16:24.652 --> 00:16:25.853]  Of course, she's a big historian.
[00:16:25.873 --> 00:16:27.514]  That's what she's got a degree in.
[00:16:29.696 --> 00:16:30.577]  And that's the Spartans.
[00:16:30.757 --> 00:16:35.041]  And the women, when the men went to war, would say, come home with your shield or on it.
[00:16:35.301 --> 00:16:37.683]  Because if you got beat in a battle, you dropped your weapons and ran.
[00:16:38.783 --> 00:16:40.664]  Cause the other guys have their weapons, they can't run as fast.
[00:16:42.025 --> 00:16:47.728]  Well, the Spartans never dropped their weapons, you know, but the Battle of 300 and Thermopylae and all the rest of it.
[00:16:48.609 --> 00:16:52.151]  My mother is a very cool person and very reserved.
[00:16:52.851 --> 00:16:55.352]  When my mother says, listen, we don't like all this intimidation.
[00:16:55.372 --> 00:16:56.533]  We don't like all this crap going on.
[00:16:57.053 --> 00:16:59.515]  Come home with your shielder on it because
[00:17:01.147 --> 00:17:02.788]  If you win a battle, you've got your shield.
[00:17:03.409 --> 00:17:04.890]  If you run, you don't have your shield.
[00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:06.071]  Or you come home dead.
[00:17:06.091 --> 00:17:13.837]  The way to carry a warrior is two men hold the shield on each side, use it as a stretcher, with the dead body laid over.
[00:17:14.618 --> 00:17:16.759]  And so, I'm going to take orders from my mother.
[00:17:16.779 --> 00:17:20.683]  Because she never tries to give me orders.
[00:17:20.743 --> 00:17:23.185]  But when she gives me one, every ten years I follow it.
[00:17:26.807 --> 00:17:28.569]  Come home with your shield or on it.
[00:17:31.581 --> 00:17:37.925]  When my ex-wife was starting the divorce against me and doing all this stuff, I said, I'll just make amends and, you know, go back with her and whatever.
[00:17:37.945 --> 00:17:40.967]  My mother looked at me and she said, you're going to be well clear of this.
[00:17:41.087 --> 00:17:41.928]  Get divorced right now.
[00:17:42.168 --> 00:17:42.808]  And she's Christian.
[00:17:42.828 --> 00:17:43.309]  She's against it.
[00:17:43.329 --> 00:17:44.449]  She said, you need divorce right now.
[00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:45.570]  And I said, yes, ma'am.
[00:17:46.331 --> 00:17:47.231]  That was 10 years ago.
[00:17:47.571 --> 00:17:50.093]  That's the last time my mother told me what I should do.
[00:17:50.153 --> 00:17:55.176]  She looked at me and she said, I want you to come home on your shield with your shoulder on it.
[00:17:58.479 --> 00:17:58.899]  Mama said,
[00:18:01.092 --> 00:18:04.913]  And I will either win this fight, or I will come home politically on my shield.
[00:18:05.334 --> 00:18:08.915]  But I will not drop my shield, and I will no longer put up with all this crap.
[00:18:10.475 --> 00:18:18.138]  So, I feel sorry for the crew, but if the enemy was even smart, firing Tucker Carlson made him ten times bigger.
[00:18:18.498 --> 00:18:21.139]  They're just, they can't help it, they're ham-fisted, they never quit.
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.100]  So, hey!
[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:23.460]  That's your issue.
[00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:24.941]  But the...
[00:18:26.121 --> 00:18:28.922]  Imminent shutdown of Infowars is here.
[00:18:29.242 --> 00:18:29.523]  Imminent.
[00:18:30.203 --> 00:18:32.464]  That judge is giving them a year and a half, he's giving you six months.
[00:18:32.744 --> 00:18:33.904]  Judge Lopez has done a good job.
[00:18:35.665 --> 00:18:37.786]  I don't think he's corrupt, I don't think he's bad, I think he's very fair.
[00:18:37.806 --> 00:18:39.187]  He's had a huge caseload.
[00:18:40.207 --> 00:18:43.368]  And he's just, he's told them over and over again, hey, you better settle here.
[00:18:45.449 --> 00:18:46.350]  They don't want to, folks.
[00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:47.330]  So that's okay.
[00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:48.811]  Give George Soros what they want.
[00:18:48.831 --> 00:18:50.091]  They'll go report back to George Soros.
[00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:53.633]  And then I'm sure I'll be able to do some new system and we'll get the crew hired back.
[00:18:54.557 --> 00:18:57.640]  Now, they may come to Jesus and realize that, and that's fine too.
[00:18:58.981 --> 00:19:00.602]  But it's all out of loyalty to this crew.
[00:19:04.625 --> 00:19:06.187]  All out of loyalty to this crew that I'm still here.
[00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:12.972]  So, to the New World Order, I'm gonna explain something to you right now.
[00:19:15.755 --> 00:19:19.898]  I could go away right now, and my work's already done.
[00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:21.760]  But I intend to stay on here and keep fighting.
[00:19:24.349 --> 00:19:37.819]  But I could go on air right now and say, I'm out of here and I'm gone, and we've already caused irrevocable damage to you, and now the main focus and the main wave, the tidal wave, is of the Great Awakening.
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:44.424]  But I believe, if it's God's wish, we will stay on air.
[00:19:45.762 --> 00:19:47.503]  But I am also not going to lie to the crew.
[00:19:47.863 --> 00:19:51.105]  I told them a year and a half ago when we went into bankruptcy, I said, this will take a year or so.
[00:19:51.665 --> 00:19:53.506]  I'll let you know if your job's in danger.
[00:19:53.526 --> 00:20:00.309]  I promise you, I will tell you when I think things are down, so you can get another job, go somewhere else, do whatever.
[00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:07.233]  And I've been honest to them, and I've told them that, and I'm telling you that, because that's my superpower, is just telling people.
[00:20:07.253 --> 00:20:08.494]  Say, don't tell me what you think.
[00:20:08.634 --> 00:20:10.054]  Stop telling people all this stuff.
[00:20:10.415 --> 00:20:10.855]  You know what?
[00:20:10.935 --> 00:20:12.716]  I've done nothing wrong except fight tyranny.
[00:20:13.684 --> 00:20:18.745]  And I have nothing here to lose, except my integrity, and I will not lose that.
[00:20:19.705 --> 00:20:21.206]  So, I believe this is going to work.
[00:20:21.546 --> 00:20:22.386]  I believe it's going to happen.
[00:20:22.466 --> 00:20:23.726]  I believe Infowars will stay on air.
[00:20:25.847 --> 00:20:40.050]  But, if the enemy thinks shutting this down gives them a victory, and if they think that that is something that they are committed to doing, then so be it.
[00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:41.971]  And if they think it's a bluff, they're about to find out it's not.
[00:20:44.269 --> 00:20:47.271]  I'm not going to compromise what we've already said, what we've done.
[00:20:47.351 --> 00:20:47.832]  That's it.
[00:20:48.572 --> 00:20:49.753]  What we've offered them is it.
[00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:52.415]  And that's done.
[00:20:52.435 --> 00:20:53.976]  And I feel good in that.
[00:20:55.398 --> 00:21:03.704]  And then there's just such insane paranoia with any other parties involved, that when I'm talking about the Globalist Democratic Party, they think it's them.
[00:21:03.724 --> 00:21:05.285]  And it's just sad.
[00:21:05.305 --> 00:21:06.646]  But I don't have time to go around and gossip.
[00:21:06.666 --> 00:21:08.247]  I don't have time to go around and play games.
[00:21:08.327 --> 00:21:08.848]  I don't do that.
[00:21:09.488 --> 00:21:10.049]  I deliver.
[00:21:10.589 --> 00:21:14.853]  Every day, seven days a week, on the air, kicking New World Order ass.
[00:21:15.373 --> 00:21:18.015]  And the only reason I am still on air is because of all of you.
[00:21:18.296 --> 00:21:21.058]  So you can know that when I'm on air, you're on air.
[00:21:21.498 --> 00:21:24.461]  And through me, you are annihilating the New World Order.
[00:21:24.521 --> 00:21:25.962]  And I hope you run for office.
[00:21:26.102 --> 00:21:27.363]  I hope you go speak at city council.
[00:21:27.683 --> 00:21:28.904]  I hope you start a podcast.
[00:21:28.924 --> 00:21:29.705]  I hope you write a book.
[00:21:29.965 --> 00:21:31.286]  You're just as important as I am.
[00:21:31.507 --> 00:21:32.968]  But I'm saying your decision
[00:21:34.946 --> 00:21:40.128]  To pray for me and to pray for this operation is paramount, and so I don't need your financial support.
[00:21:40.148 --> 00:21:41.369]  We've got great products you already need.
[00:21:41.409 --> 00:21:42.490]  They're at InfoWars.com.
[00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:53.535]  But what I really need, because it's real and it's paramount, it's central, is your prayer for God's will to be done for InfoWars.
[00:21:54.457 --> 00:21:58.860]  And to sustain this operation, and to have all the obstacles in front of us be defeated.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.501]  Because I want to continue InfoWars.
[00:22:00.981 --> 00:22:02.562]  I am 100% straight up about that.
[00:22:03.262 --> 00:22:11.907]  But the subterfuge, and the things that have gone on behind the scenes that are just unbelievable, make what happened at Project Veritas look tame.
[00:22:14.189 --> 00:22:16.690]  So, if you want to know what's going on around here, it's what happened at Project Veritas.
[00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:17.971]  But even worse.
[00:22:26.115 --> 00:22:35.099]  I never bowed to the New World Order when Roger Ailes tried to give me a job at Fox or Henry Kissinger tried to hire me and all the other things.
[00:22:35.739 --> 00:22:40.261]  And these people, they think that I am going to bow to them.
[00:22:41.321 --> 00:22:42.062]  Never going to happen.
[00:22:42.162 --> 00:22:46.703]  I bow to one thing and that's God Almighty and His Son Jesus Christ.
[00:22:47.324 --> 00:22:48.524]  No king but King Jesus.
[00:22:50.525 --> 00:22:52.606]  So I feel like a trillion pound weight is off of me.
[00:22:53.786 --> 00:23:00.250]  Because I wasn't compromising with the system, but I was giving it a chance and no more.
[00:23:02.111 --> 00:23:11.837]  You know that old saying, I don't know how all this is going to end, but if you want to fight, you better believe you got one, but just know it's a two way street.
[00:23:13.798 --> 00:23:19.321]  I would tell my enemies, people think they know better, who have the least grandeur, just walk away.
[00:23:21.703 --> 00:23:22.263]  Just walk away.
[00:23:24.517 --> 00:23:30.260]  Because I don't want to have to stand up against you and defeat you because you don't matter to me.
[00:23:31.421 --> 00:23:32.601]  You're not important enough for that.
[00:23:37.544 --> 00:23:39.945]  But I got a feeling you're not going to listen, and that's alright.
[00:23:39.965 --> 00:23:42.867]  Because now you got something coming down on you.
[00:23:44.193 --> 00:23:52.240]  All our years of work, 30 years on air in April, everything we've done, my ancestors praying hard and fighting hard and paying it forward to the next generation.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:59.385]  I am not just held in position by the audience, but I'm held in position by my ancestors and all the goodwill they put forward.
[00:24:00.086 --> 00:24:06.751]  And I do not believe, I know that we are destined to even do greater things together.
[00:24:06.771 --> 00:24:10.334]  All right, I'm done talking about that.
[00:24:12.349 --> 00:24:13.210]  Give the phone number out.
[00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:21.894]  We've got huge economic news, huge political news, huge Trump news, massive police state news, huge false flag martial law news.
[00:24:22.235 --> 00:24:22.835]  I mean, look at this.
[00:24:23.275 --> 00:24:28.878]  California to make illegal aliens eligible for zero down payment industry home loans, but not citizens.
[00:24:29.019 --> 00:24:30.039]  I mean, you can't make that up.
[00:24:30.499 --> 00:24:33.561]  Huge poison COVID stack, massive developments.
[00:24:34.382 --> 00:24:36.643]  I keep saying every week, the biggest yet, because they just get bigger and bigger.
[00:24:40.071 --> 00:24:48.517]  Thought Police snitches bill in Washington State offers 2,000 rewards to residents who report neighbors guilty of wrong speak.
[00:24:48.537 --> 00:24:49.598]  They should call it wrong speak.
[00:24:50.879 --> 00:24:53.341]  Hedge fund icon talks about the economy about to go belly up.
[00:24:55.983 --> 00:24:59.726]  We've got a lot to cover here today, the stupid ass Oscars.
[00:25:01.049 --> 00:25:11.531]  We're going to be looking at it all, but I want to give out the toll-free number right now for first-time callers on any issue, any comment, any question.
[00:25:11.571 --> 00:25:12.551]  You agree, you disagree.
[00:25:13.311 --> 00:25:14.372]  It is unfiltered.
[00:25:14.452 --> 00:25:18.353]  Just have a clean phone line and be ready to talk when I go to you.
[00:25:19.993 --> 00:25:21.533]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539, 877-789-ALEX.
[00:25:26.713 --> 00:25:27.653]  877-789-2539.
[00:25:27.673 --> 00:25:30.094]  877-789-Alex.
[00:25:30.114 --> 00:25:38.597]  And we're going to take your phone calls today.
[00:25:40.877 --> 00:25:42.618]  We'll talk about the terrible events in Haiti.
[00:25:42.638 --> 00:25:46.659]  Haiti's been cursed from the beginning because of the intense Satanism that goes on there.
[00:25:47.139 --> 00:25:54.321]  There are black nations in Africa that are Christian that are as productive as European nations because they're Christian.
[00:25:56.084 --> 00:26:01.228]  It's like Europe was in the dark ages before they found Christ.
[00:26:02.829 --> 00:26:05.251]  But Haiti is now entering cannibalism.
[00:26:05.271 --> 00:26:05.311]  U.S.
[00:26:05.731 --> 00:26:08.874]  sends troops to Haiti as cannibalistic gangs take over the region.
[00:26:10.555 --> 00:26:11.756]  Absolute hell on earth.
[00:26:12.417 --> 00:26:15.419]  Rand Paul teases Senate GOP leader run.
[00:26:15.439 --> 00:26:23.705]  Rand Paul teases Senate GOP leader run.
[00:26:24.446 --> 00:26:25.827]  Musk says, I want support.
[00:26:30.646 --> 00:26:31.506]  That's very exciting.
[00:26:33.747 --> 00:26:36.448]  It's all coming up here today.
[00:26:39.629 --> 00:26:54.115]  And then, of course, we've got a lot of news dealing with the transgender cult and what they're up to and what they're doing.
[00:26:56.397 --> 00:27:01.259]  Doctors admit link between transgender hormones therapy and cancer in leaked emails.
[00:27:02.539 --> 00:27:10.843]  How many times have I told you that the hormones they give males and females trying to bend their gender stunt growth and cause cancer?
[00:27:12.143 --> 00:27:13.103]  They've known this forever.
[00:27:13.143 --> 00:27:15.844]  It's like all scientific American and all that a month ago.
[00:27:15.904 --> 00:27:19.706]  For the first time, scientists discovered the brains of men and women are different.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:25.523]  It's like saying a whale in the ocean is different than an elephant on land.
[00:27:25.543 --> 00:27:32.329]  You don't need a scientist to tell you, but it's what the gender-bending chemicals in the food and water do.
[00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:35.792]  We've got those reports and it ties in.
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.561]  To all these other reports on it.
[00:27:40.481 --> 00:27:46.445]  Secret files show how an international group pushes shocking experimental gender surgery for minors that is so brutal.
[00:27:46.965 --> 00:27:57.692]  They'll cut off your forearms, your muscle and your skin, and they'll create a big fake penis that's got a plastic tube in it to pee out of.
[00:27:57.752 --> 00:27:58.473]  It's a catheter.
[00:27:58.933 --> 00:28:03.676]  It has no feeling other than the pain, and it usually, within a few years, rots and falls off.
[00:28:04.807 --> 00:28:06.128]  You want me to show you videos of this?
[00:28:06.228 --> 00:28:11.613]  I mean, I don't think I need to, but they know it's Hellraiser, folks, and little girls with their breasts cut off.
[00:28:12.093 --> 00:28:16.657]  I mean, this is like, but make it fashionable, make it cool, make it trendy, and then people do it.
[00:28:16.717 --> 00:28:30.809]  We've got all of that, and I'm sorry to cover such incredible horrors here, but we have to admit the horror, and we have to deal with the horror so that we can defeat the horror.
[00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:40.872]  I'm Alex Jones, your embattled host, in the fulcrum, taking on the globalists at point-blank range, in, through, and beyond.
[00:28:41.732 --> 00:28:49.514]  Pray for us, support us, because this is either going to be the next launchpad or the twilight of InfoWars.
[00:28:50.374 --> 00:28:51.575]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:51.595 --> 00:28:52.035]  Stay with us.
[00:29:05.385 --> 00:29:06.345]  Please support us.

[00:29:19.531 --> 00:29:21.472]  They're all incredible products.
[00:29:22.878 --> 00:29:26.001]  Next Level Foundational Energy is about to sell out, but it's not a stimulant.
[00:29:26.061 --> 00:29:27.422]  No, it's the energy of the cells.
[00:29:27.482 --> 00:29:28.362]  Different level energy.
[00:29:28.663 --> 00:29:29.523]  That's why it's Next Level.
[00:29:29.884 --> 00:29:31.765]  That's why TurboForce is 10-hour clean energy.
[00:29:31.805 --> 00:29:34.647]  It is a bunch of stimulants that are natural and good, with a good letdown.
[00:29:35.368 --> 00:29:35.788]  Amazing.
[00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:37.009]  TurboForce.
[00:29:37.049 --> 00:29:38.110]  Next Level Foundational Energy.
[00:29:38.911 --> 00:29:39.771]  You clean out your blood.
[00:29:39.952 --> 00:29:41.973]  Everybody should be on now.
[00:29:43.595 --> 00:29:44.355]  NitricBoost.
[00:29:44.755 --> 00:29:47.298]  InfoWarStore.com.
[00:29:47.418 --> 00:29:48.118]  NitricBoost.
[00:29:48.819 --> 00:29:49.759]  We're funded by the people.
[00:29:49.779 --> 00:29:50.560]  Thanks for your support.
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:51.341]  I'll be right back.
[00:29:53.035 --> 00:30:05.882]  Infowars is listener-supported, and we appreciate your donations.
[00:30:06.583 --> 00:30:09.544]  But buy a product, and support your health, too.
[00:30:10.765 --> 00:30:14.447]  Nitric oxide is an important chemical messenger in the body.
[00:30:14.987 --> 00:30:19.350]  It promotes blood flow, and it helps nerve cells communicate with one another.
[00:30:20.214 --> 00:30:23.160]  But over time, our bodies produce less of it.
[00:30:24.502 --> 00:30:32.676]  Full of amino acids to produce nitric oxide, Nitric Boost helps raise the amount of nitric oxide in your body.
[00:30:33.846 --> 00:30:40.308]  Nitric oxide is needed for strength, cardiovascular function, and healthy neurotransmission.
[00:30:41.288 --> 00:30:45.669]  It helps to improve blood flow, which helps improve overall immunity.

[00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:54.372]  Support your health and support the InfoWar at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.001]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalists.
[00:31:02.361 --> 00:31:04.722]  And people can't identify who's a patriot and who isn't.
[00:31:05.042 --> 00:31:08.183]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalists.
[00:31:08.243 --> 00:31:11.144]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.
[00:31:11.404 --> 00:31:21.988]  That's why I designed this amazing 1776 red, white, and blue Gadsden flag shirt so you can support the Info War and meet like-minded people everywhere when you wear it.
[00:31:22.108 --> 00:31:22.608]  We're good to go.
[00:31:40.455 --> 00:31:41.076]  I think so.
[00:32:00.359 --> 00:32:03.481]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:32:03.501 --> 00:32:05.021]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:32:05.802 --> 00:32:08.843]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:32:09.744 --> 00:32:17.828]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:32:18.668 --> 00:32:26.452]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:32:27.481 --> 00:32:30.344]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:32:30.364 --> 00:32:36.109]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:39.912]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[00:32:39.952 --> 00:32:48.180]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:52.542]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at M4store.com.
[00:32:53.183 --> 00:32:57.785]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to M4store.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:32:58.125 --> 00:32:58.986]  Please take action now.
[00:33:01.827 --> 00:33:07.731]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:17.071 --> 00:33:18.133]  Another world.
[00:33:18.494 --> 00:33:19.336]  Another time.
[00:33:19.717 --> 00:33:20.618]  Another time.
[00:33:20.859 --> 00:33:22.623]  In the Age of Wonder.
[00:33:22.723 --> 00:33:23.925]  In the Age of Wonder.
[00:33:30.979 --> 00:33:32.881]  The enemy is making its move now.
[00:33:33.061 --> 00:33:36.585]  They're preparing civil war and race wars.
[00:33:38.207 --> 00:33:40.170]  You are receiving this transmission.
[00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:41.992]  You are the resistance.
[00:33:42.692 --> 00:33:44.675]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[00:33:45.015 --> 00:33:46.797]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[00:33:47.498 --> 00:33:48.739]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:51.949 --> 00:34:01.653]  If you look at me confident here, under such attack, and you ask why, because I know it's happening regardless of what I do, because I'm not the only one under attack.
[00:34:02.253 --> 00:34:10.096]  You are under attack, and I bet on you 30 years ago when I got on air, I know who you are.
[00:34:10.116 --> 00:34:14.378]  And I know this is gonna be rough, but in the end we're gonna win.
[00:34:16.619 --> 00:34:19.160]  We didn't ask for it, but it's here.
[00:34:24.711 --> 00:34:26.092]  I've never been more focused.
[00:34:26.152 --> 00:34:29.795]  I've never been more on target.
[00:34:30.895 --> 00:34:37.820]  I've never been more in sync with God doing exactly what I'm supposed to do.
[00:34:52.557 --> 00:34:56.720]  Now, I want to go to your phone calls, and then I'll intersperse all this news that I was just mentioning.
[00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:58.901]  But let's get to a little bit of the news before I go back to your calls.
[00:34:58.981 --> 00:35:01.043]  Look at these headlines.
[00:35:02.404 --> 00:35:05.126]  We shouldn't have gone into Ukraine, says Biden.
[00:35:06.647 --> 00:35:14.532]  In the same interview where he apologized to the illegal alien, has been arrested and indicted for murdering that young woman in Georgia.
[00:35:16.273 --> 00:35:18.255]  One man dies, it's a tragedy, 10,000 deaths.
[00:35:18.395 --> 00:35:20.977]  Statistics tell us that illegals are killing masses of people.
[00:35:23.749 --> 00:35:26.351]  People are focused on this particular woman, which is good.
[00:35:26.611 --> 00:35:27.612]  They should all be focused on.
[00:35:27.632 --> 00:35:37.301]  And of course he was speaking about Afghanistan, but that just shows how out of his mind he is.
[00:35:38.241 --> 00:35:38.722]  Roll the clip.
[00:35:44.301 --> 00:35:44.782]  Ukraine.
[00:35:44.882 --> 00:35:48.444]  I mean, we should have got into... Start it over.
[00:35:48.464 --> 00:35:49.824]  We have a new computer system.
[00:35:50.445 --> 00:35:52.826]  The guys are training on it, so the clubs are having problems today.
[00:35:52.846 --> 00:35:53.526]  It's no big deal.
[00:35:53.846 --> 00:35:54.266]  Start it over.
[00:35:54.287 --> 00:35:54.527]  Go ahead.
[00:35:55.467 --> 00:35:57.389]  I sat with him and I sat with the War Cabinet.
[00:35:57.409 --> 00:35:59.592]  I said, look, don't make the mistake America made.
[00:36:00.352 --> 00:36:01.273]  America made a mistake.
[00:36:01.333 --> 00:36:03.095]  We went after Bin Laden until we got him.
[00:36:03.616 --> 00:36:05.698]  But we shouldn't have gone into Ukraine.
[00:36:05.758 --> 00:36:11.104]  I mean, we shouldn't have gone into the whole thing in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:36:11.164 --> 00:36:12.586]  It wasn't necessary.
[00:36:12.606 --> 00:36:14.047]  It wasn't necessary.
[00:36:14.067 --> 00:36:17.271]  It just caused more problems in the race than it cured.
[00:36:20.023 --> 00:36:25.728]  So, that's Sleepy Joe right there, but what he's saying is true, except it's bigger than that.
[00:36:26.108 --> 00:36:29.571]  The West shouldn't have overthrown an elected Ukrainian government 10 years ago.
[00:36:29.871 --> 00:36:31.313]  They shouldn't have started a fight with the Russians.
[00:36:31.553 --> 00:36:33.114]  They shouldn't have moved weapons from their border.
[00:36:33.314 --> 00:36:34.355]  Does that mean Putin's perfect?
[00:36:34.595 --> 00:36:36.016]  Does that mean I support Putin?
[00:36:36.057 --> 00:36:41.641]  No, it means I don't go around starting fights with the biggest nuclear power in the world in their backyard.
[00:36:45.104 --> 00:36:47.046]  Big headline, Viktor Orban.
[00:36:49.858 --> 00:36:55.981]  Trump has come out, the Hungarian Prime Minister, and said Trump has a plan to end the Ukraine conflict.
[00:36:57.282 --> 00:36:59.303]  And people say, oh Trump can't end it if he gets re-elected.
[00:36:59.323 --> 00:37:06.387]  90% of it's funded by the U.S.
[00:37:06.407 --> 00:37:08.048]  You cut the funding off, it ends overnight.
[00:37:08.368 --> 00:37:09.509]  Trump will force a peace deal.
[00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:10.389]  Of course he can do it.
[00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:12.231]  That's not a hard claim.
[00:37:12.771 --> 00:37:13.631]  That's not a boast.
[00:37:15.066 --> 00:37:15.927]  That is easy!
[00:37:16.587 --> 00:37:22.553]  It's like I turn my thermostat down or up, or I start my car, or I put my boots on, or I pull up and order a hamburger.
[00:37:23.413 --> 00:37:29.879]  It's easy because our nation, hijacked by the globalists, is running this whole thing.
[00:37:32.702 --> 00:37:39.848]  Continuing, Infowars.com article, elite units of Ukrainian armed forces discuss overthrowing Zelensky.
[00:37:39.888 --> 00:37:41.930]  That came out months ago, now they admit it.
[00:37:43.612 --> 00:37:46.493]  Because he's feeding them into a meat grinder.
[00:37:48.454 --> 00:37:49.935]  All right, let's go to your phone calls.
[00:37:51.415 --> 00:37:58.818]  Then I'll get into the huge transgender cancer link, the massive cancer risk, or 50% among fully vaccinated.
[00:37:59.318 --> 00:38:00.079]  Wait till we hit that.
[00:38:00.139 --> 00:38:03.360]  We've got so much today, but I want to take your calls.
[00:38:04.622 --> 00:38:13.666]  Josh, Marcus, Jonathan, Andrew, Luke, Justin, Ann, Ben, Jana, Robert, Aaron, we're going to take your calls the order they were received.
[00:38:14.126 --> 00:38:16.507]  Josh in New Mexico, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:38:18.007 --> 00:38:18.708]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:38:18.788 --> 00:38:19.508]  Can you hear me okay?
[00:38:19.528 --> 00:38:20.028]  I can, sir.
[00:38:20.068 --> 00:38:20.768]  Thank you for calling.
[00:38:21.749 --> 00:38:22.069]  Excellent.
[00:38:22.109 --> 00:38:23.489]  Thank you for taking my call, sir.
[00:38:23.509 --> 00:38:25.890]  You know, I just want to make a couple quick points.
[00:38:26.451 --> 00:38:30.932]  They both have to do with, you know, everyone asking, what do we do?
[00:38:30.972 --> 00:38:31.432]  What do we do?
[00:38:33.234 --> 00:38:39.116]  Have a bit of solution that's already been touched on by you and a lot of your guests, but I just want to give it another perspective the way I see it.
[00:38:39.496 --> 00:38:51.640]  And the other point that I want to make is recognizing truth and recognizing that truth is, well, it's everything that sets us free in many ways, but also realizing the message of truth is always bigger than the messenger, right?
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:55.341]  But first and foremost, I'd also like to plug some of your products and say that they're excellent.
[00:38:55.421 --> 00:38:56.121]  All of them are excellent.
[00:38:56.141 --> 00:38:57.821]  I've bought your products for a very long time.
[00:38:58.662 --> 00:38:59.502]  T-shirts, hats,
[00:39:00.399 --> 00:39:05.484]  I totally agree with you, but since you raised that, let me make this point.
[00:39:24.807 --> 00:39:26.908]  People ask, should they continue to support InfoWars?
[00:39:26.968 --> 00:39:29.649]  Yes, I believe we'll approve our bankruptcy and go through and keep it on air.
[00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:35.152]  But if it gets taken over and shut down, I will no longer be here.
[00:39:35.352 --> 00:39:39.934]  And don't worry, we'll work with new sponsors and new groups to bring you products as good or even better.
[00:39:40.594 --> 00:39:43.595]  So yes, while I'm still on air, I appreciate everybody supporting.
[00:39:44.076 --> 00:39:45.816]  And if you want the products now, it's great to get them.
[00:39:46.517 --> 00:39:48.237]  But I mean, I'm not kidding around, folks.
[00:39:49.838 --> 00:39:53.021]  Yeah, so what I just want to say is that a lot of people keep wondering, you know, what do we do?
[00:39:53.281 --> 00:39:53.861]  What do we do?
[00:39:54.282 --> 00:39:56.884]  Well, I should say that, you know, especially when it comes to politics, we need to focus
[00:40:18.562 --> 00:40:20.544]  Uh, local politics, right?
[00:40:20.744 --> 00:40:36.636]  We need to take this country back the same way that we lost it, which is incrementally, and I've heard you and your guests say the same thing, and I've just been believing it, and you guys say it, and I'm just like, yes, you know, we all must be over the target, there must be that thing where we're all synced up, you know, so it must be, you know, synergizing its truth, right?
[00:40:37.196 --> 00:40:48.165]  So, you know, everyone needs to fight back incrementally, you know, we need to get out of this mindset that, you know, that Hollywood and the media has got us in, where we look for this big, grandiose
[00:40:48.952 --> 00:40:50.834]  I totally agree.
[00:40:50.914 --> 00:40:55.898]  Every Hollywood movie is one guy saves everything, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:40:55.918 --> 00:40:56.358]  Exactly.
[00:40:56.398 --> 00:40:56.778]  No, no, no.
[00:40:56.798 --> 00:40:58.399]  It's the people doing it.
[00:40:58.419 --> 00:41:00.461]  I got a bunch of clips of that next hour.
[00:41:01.242 --> 00:41:02.723]  It's the people syncing up.
[00:41:02.783 --> 00:41:03.924]  The power is all of us.
[00:41:04.844 --> 00:41:05.325]  Exactly.
[00:41:05.385 --> 00:41:07.566]  And people need to realize that it's not going to be one person.
[00:41:07.606 --> 00:41:08.507]  It's not a Donald Trump.
[00:41:08.547 --> 00:41:09.348]  It's not an Elon Musk.
[00:41:09.408 --> 00:41:13.091]  Oh yeah, that's when callers call in and say, thank you for saving us and being so good.
[00:41:13.111 --> 00:41:14.992]  I'm like, you're the ones tuned in.
[00:41:15.092 --> 00:41:15.953]  You're the power.
[00:41:16.153 --> 00:41:17.254]  Sure, I'm a focal point.
[00:41:18.271 --> 00:41:19.791]  Well, we're like a giant mountain range.
[00:41:19.811 --> 00:41:22.432]  Sure, I'm one of the big mountains, but all of you are part of this.
[00:41:22.512 --> 00:41:24.572]  And I don't say that to pat you on the head.
[00:41:24.892 --> 00:41:26.233]  It's everything, dammit!
[00:41:27.953 --> 00:41:28.693]  You're absolutely right.
[00:41:28.753 --> 00:41:29.233]  I agree.
[00:41:29.313 --> 00:41:29.853]  That's true.
[00:41:29.933 --> 00:41:34.114]  And it's like that saying, you know, someone can't do everything, but everyone can do something.
[00:41:34.254 --> 00:41:37.235]  Everybody out there can do something, no matter how big or how small.
[00:41:37.255 --> 00:41:38.695]  Many hands make light work.
[00:41:39.715 --> 00:41:40.255]  Absolutely.
[00:41:40.315 --> 00:41:41.396]  And everyone can do something.
[00:41:41.616 --> 00:41:46.497]  And it doesn't matter, you know, how little or insignificant your effort may be.
[00:41:46.597 --> 00:41:47.757]  If we all do it together,
[00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:49.551]  See, that's where we take it.
[00:41:49.651 --> 00:41:52.413]  And it's that belief and that will that builds.
[00:41:52.453 --> 00:41:53.013]  Thank you for the call.
[00:41:53.073 --> 00:41:53.494]  Great point.
[00:41:54.194 --> 00:41:55.015]  I want to say something right now.
[00:41:56.896 --> 00:41:58.257]  God is everything.
[00:41:59.358 --> 00:42:01.119]  And you think about that statement, of course that's true.
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:03.681]  God is everything.
[00:42:03.761 --> 00:42:09.766]  God is all-powerful, but God gave us free will, so we have to follow God's will, and that's how God acts in the universe.
[00:42:13.581 --> 00:42:16.844]  So if God's everything and God works through you, you're everything.
[00:42:17.365 --> 00:42:19.787]  And that's why when callers call in and say, oh, you're so great.
[00:42:20.087 --> 00:42:21.228]  What, I don't want to be a slave?
[00:42:21.549 --> 00:42:23.210]  I don't want to chop our son's penises off?
[00:42:23.531 --> 00:42:24.692]  I don't want to have World War III?
[00:42:24.792 --> 00:42:25.613]  That's not heroic.
[00:42:25.653 --> 00:42:26.674]  That's just common sense.
[00:42:28.155 --> 00:42:29.416]  I'm just like you folks.
[00:42:29.597 --> 00:42:33.040]  You are the power.
[00:42:34.681 --> 00:42:36.043]  And that's why I stop people.
[00:42:37.076 --> 00:42:47.274]  When they're thanking me, and I say, okay, I appreciate you too, but you called in, you're supporting, you're just as important as me, and all of you together are way more important than me, a trillion times.
[00:42:48.328 --> 00:42:54.051]  And I don't say that to be self-deprecating or to sound like, oh, I'm magnanimous and I'm this great.
[00:42:54.271 --> 00:42:55.851]  No, you're everything.
[00:42:56.332 --> 00:42:57.012]  You're everything.
[00:42:57.292 --> 00:42:57.992]  You're everything.
[00:42:58.252 --> 00:42:59.053]  You're important.
[00:42:59.293 --> 00:43:00.073]  You have the power.
[00:43:00.373 --> 00:43:02.194]  You decide if InfoWars rises or falls.
[00:43:02.554 --> 00:43:03.655]  You are in the driver's seat.
[00:43:04.095 --> 00:43:05.016]  You are in control.
[00:43:05.036 --> 00:43:05.096]  You.
[00:43:05.496 --> 00:43:05.816]  You.
[00:43:05.836 --> 00:43:05.896]  You.
[00:43:06.256 --> 00:43:06.456]  You.
[00:43:06.476 --> 00:43:06.596]  You.
[00:43:06.616 --> 00:43:06.676]  You.
[00:43:07.016 --> 00:43:07.197]  You.
[00:43:07.217 --> 00:43:07.377]  You.
[00:43:07.397 --> 00:43:07.457]  You.
[00:43:07.817 --> 00:43:08.017]  You.
[00:43:13.683 --> 00:43:15.765]  Trump would have no power if it wasn't for us.
[00:43:16.286 --> 00:43:18.288]  Elon Musk would have no power if it wasn't for us.
[00:43:18.629 --> 00:43:25.577]  Sure, they're interesting, they're informative, they've got a better plan than globalists, but they're not going to fix it if we aren't on board.
[00:43:29.081 --> 00:43:29.361]  You.
[00:43:29.782 --> 00:43:30.923]  You are the driver.
[00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:33.270]  You are in control.
[00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:34.471]  You have the free will.
[00:43:34.791 --> 00:43:35.612]  You have the power.
[00:43:35.952 --> 00:43:36.232]  You.
[00:43:36.632 --> 00:43:36.933]  You.
[00:43:37.313 --> 00:43:37.613]  You.
[00:43:37.973 --> 00:43:38.174]  You.
[00:43:38.194 --> 00:43:40.075]  People say, oh, I know you don't like to be thanked.
[00:43:40.435 --> 00:43:41.236]  I love being thanked.
[00:43:41.496 --> 00:43:43.097]  I love when I'm out at dinner and somebody buys me dinner.
[00:43:43.337 --> 00:43:44.678]  I love meeting a family, taking pictures.
[00:43:44.758 --> 00:43:45.499]  I love you guys.
[00:43:45.859 --> 00:43:49.021]  But I'm telling you, you need to realize how important you are.
[00:43:49.041 --> 00:43:51.263]  When I meet you, I'm looking at victory.
[00:43:51.883 --> 00:43:55.085]  At families in black and white and Hispanic and old and young and all of you.
[00:43:55.306 --> 00:43:58.488]  And I'm looking at you like this is the victory and I see your eyes are alive.
[00:44:00.509 --> 00:44:01.330]  And I want you to stop.
[00:44:02.737 --> 00:44:06.759]  I'm thinking that I'm the leader.
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:09.401]  You are the leader.
[00:44:10.862 --> 00:44:12.463]  Yes, I volunteered for this mission.
[00:44:13.563 --> 00:44:14.964]  And yes, we've had incredible success.
[00:44:15.064 --> 00:44:16.225]  It's all God and you.
[00:44:16.545 --> 00:44:18.546]  Yeah, I'm a little tiny piece of it.
[00:44:18.967 --> 00:44:24.370]  But you have to internalize that you are the victory and then externalize that.
[00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:26.191]  I couldn't do this without the crew I've got.
[00:44:26.591 --> 00:44:27.832]  I couldn't do this without my family.
[00:44:34.502 --> 00:44:36.662]  I couldn't do it without my mother, who never gives me advice.
[00:44:36.682 --> 00:44:38.323]  I mean, we're talking every 10 years.
[00:44:39.283 --> 00:44:40.343]  What she gives and I take it.
[00:44:40.363 --> 00:44:44.184]  She said, I think you're getting pushed around, and I don't think you look happy with what you're doing.
[00:44:44.564 --> 00:44:46.244]  You need to go on the attack.
[00:44:47.584 --> 00:44:48.864]  And you know what I say when my mother tells me that?
[00:44:49.485 --> 00:44:50.005]  Yes, ma'am.
[00:44:50.025 --> 00:44:50.525]  And I salute.
[00:44:52.705 --> 00:44:56.026]  Because she's been sitting around for years, watching and thinking and praying.
[00:44:56.366 --> 00:44:59.166]  Literally, my mother prays for hours a day.
[00:45:00.226 --> 00:45:01.047]  Don't make a big deal about her.
[00:45:01.087 --> 00:45:01.967]  She's a very proud person.
[00:45:02.487 --> 00:45:03.227]  Literally a saint.
[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:06.061]  Hours a day.
[00:45:07.982 --> 00:45:08.903]  An hour in the morning.
[00:45:08.943 --> 00:45:10.024]  An hour in the evening.
[00:45:11.905 --> 00:45:12.706]  That's connection.
[00:45:12.746 --> 00:45:14.267]  Just like her mother who was a saint.
[00:45:15.027 --> 00:45:16.809]  And her grandmother who was amazing.
[00:45:18.830 --> 00:45:25.655]  And when the most important woman in my life tells me to do something, you better believe I do it.
[00:45:25.755 --> 00:45:26.896]  And I have pure confidence.
[00:45:29.195 --> 00:45:30.015]  Should all my enemies.
[00:45:30.455 --> 00:45:32.236]  Mama told me to do this, so get ready.
[00:45:32.916 --> 00:45:34.937]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk to Andrew in New York.
[00:45:35.037 --> 00:45:35.777]  Andrew, you're on the air.
[00:45:35.797 --> 00:45:36.238]  Go ahead.
[00:45:37.198 --> 00:45:37.738]  Can you hear me good?
[00:45:37.978 --> 00:45:38.278]  Yes, sir.
[00:45:38.298 --> 00:45:38.638]  Go ahead.
[00:45:39.919 --> 00:45:43.680]  So, I just wanted to talk about the outcomes of the possible election, if there is one.
[00:45:44.661 --> 00:45:56.405]  So, with the Courage to Serve Act, if these tens of millions of illegal, this administration's funded Democrat votes, if they win, could they use the Courage to Serve Act against U.S.
[00:45:56.425 --> 00:45:56.905]  civilians?
[00:45:57.950 --> 00:45:58.771]  Well, you just nailed it.
[00:45:58.811 --> 00:45:59.431]  You just nailed it.
[00:45:59.471 --> 00:46:05.675]  I mean, look, they have 7277 mental random State Department, the plan, the UN plan to put UN troops in through the police and military.
[00:46:05.915 --> 00:46:07.396]  So first, they purge the military and police.
[00:46:07.416 --> 00:46:11.159]  They put in UN operatives as the leaders and woke us with them.
[00:46:11.619 --> 00:46:12.640]  Then they defund the police.
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:13.320]  Things break down.
[00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:16.843]  And then you've got UN troops in US military and US police uniforms.
[00:46:16.863 --> 00:46:18.424]  So, yes, that's Obama's.
[00:46:18.724 --> 00:46:22.727]  We need a civilian military force just as big and just as strong as our military.
[00:46:23.207 --> 00:46:25.608]  So, yes, this is not there's no doubt.
[00:46:25.749 --> 00:46:27.350]  There's no like, oh, we think it.
[00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:28.930]  But again, the U.N.
[00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:30.191]  doesn't come in blue helmets.
[00:46:30.631 --> 00:46:32.132]  They come in your own uniform.
[00:46:32.192 --> 00:46:33.413]  And yes, we are at that point.
[00:46:35.834 --> 00:46:39.435]  The purge of the military happened with the mandatory injections also.
[00:46:39.515 --> 00:46:41.596]  That was just Nuremberg Code violating.
[00:46:41.656 --> 00:46:56.043]  But if Trump votes, the landslide does overdo the fraudulent vote and the illegal vote, what are the odds of a leftist coup or a false flag blamed on MAGA?
[00:46:58.956 --> 00:46:59.336]  That's it.
[00:47:01.237 --> 00:47:09.180]  And we're in the sector of false flags, race war, martial law, all of it's rolling on out.
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:14.782]  The major cities are having, of 300-400,000 people, 20 cops at night.
[00:47:16.283 --> 00:47:18.084]  I mean, this is happening, sir.
[00:47:21.345 --> 00:47:22.786]  One last note, if I could?
[00:47:23.086 --> 00:47:23.466]  Yes, please.
[00:47:24.697 --> 00:47:42.678]  Uh, Republicans really need to stop blocking Democrats and regressives on X. We have to follow them, we have to turn on their notifications, and as soon as they send out a lie to be programmed into their followers, their NPCs, we have to jump on the lie and just debunk it immediately so they can't be programmed with it.
[00:47:43.871 --> 00:47:49.014]  Well, the good news is, you can't argue with Elon Musk and people say, like, oh, you're kissing Elon Musk's ass.
[00:47:49.054 --> 00:47:50.495]  No, I'm kissing the truth's ass.
[00:47:51.055 --> 00:48:00.701]  He is getting hundreds of millions of views a day with films exposing transgenderism, open borders, world government, the new world order, the war.
[00:48:01.181 --> 00:48:04.323]  He's devastating them because he knows we're winning.
[00:48:04.964 --> 00:48:07.085]  Whether he was with them or not before, he's joined us.
[00:48:07.485 --> 00:48:09.146]  Maybe he'll double-cross us later, I don't know.
[00:48:10.487 --> 00:48:19.112]  We've got all, I'm going to say this again, all the most popular talk show hosts, the top 100, conservatively, are all anti-globalist because people are tuned into that.
[00:48:19.632 --> 00:48:22.974]  So some people may be being anti-globalist because it's so popular.
[00:48:23.154 --> 00:48:23.934]  I don't care!
[00:48:24.414 --> 00:48:29.037]  Because the end result is THE, brother, VIC-TO-RY!
[00:48:29.817 --> 00:48:31.238]  VIC-TO-RY!
[00:48:32.098 --> 00:48:38.582]  And I'm just honored to be one of the main people that knocked down the enemy defenses and blew their main gate open.
[00:48:39.724 --> 00:48:41.826]  And I want to continue to go into the city and defeat the enemy.
[00:48:41.846 --> 00:48:43.327]  But I'm telling you, we already blew their gates.
[00:48:43.707 --> 00:48:44.868]  We're already going in, folks.
[00:48:44.928 --> 00:48:47.029]  We are winning, winning, winning.
[00:48:47.049 --> 00:48:47.590]  Thanks, Nicole.
[00:48:49.331 --> 00:48:54.255]  This is an epic time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:54.775 --> 00:48:56.416]  Luke in Kansas, you're on the air.
[00:48:56.436 --> 00:48:58.858]  Hey, buddy.
[00:48:58.878 --> 00:49:05.443]  I was just wondering, what is the update on the boycott in New York City with the truckers?
[00:49:05.683 --> 00:49:07.124]  Because every time I look up,
[00:49:14.589 --> 00:49:17.310]  Well, let me explain.
[00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:18.771]  Have you ever seen Baghdad Bob in 2003?
[00:49:19.651 --> 00:49:23.393]  Guys, pull up Baghdad Bob on YouTube.
[00:49:24.793 --> 00:49:29.955]  Baghdad Bob was the Iraqi information officer and he spoke good English and he was funny as hell.
[00:49:29.975 --> 00:49:33.877]  They even put out DVDs that were best sellers of him for the week of the U.S.
[00:49:33.957 --> 00:49:34.257]  invading.
[00:49:34.277 --> 00:49:36.298]  Whether you're for the war or not, just separate that.
[00:49:37.719 --> 00:49:37.899]  U.S.
[00:49:37.939 --> 00:49:38.920]  military invades.
[00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:41.142]  They pushed all the way up to Baghdad.
[00:49:41.602 --> 00:49:45.486]  Their F-16s dropping 500-pound bombs a mile behind them.
[00:49:45.786 --> 00:49:46.747]  There's mushroom clouds.
[00:49:47.327 --> 00:49:51.491]  And Baghdad Bob is on TV saying, we have defeated the Americans.
[00:49:51.511 --> 00:49:52.692]  We pushed them back in the sea.
[00:49:53.052 --> 00:49:53.993]  We pushed them in the ocean.
[00:49:54.013 --> 00:49:55.634]  We pushed them into Kuwait.
[00:49:56.315 --> 00:49:58.977]  And Baghdad Bob is up there saying, no one's having a victory.
[00:49:59.678 --> 00:50:01.560]  Our enemies are not going to tell us we're winning.
[00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:02.300]  Here's another example.
[00:50:03.301 --> 00:50:04.142]  Tokyo Rose.
[00:50:05.236 --> 00:50:09.037]  From the beginning of World War II, when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the beginning of the U.S.
[00:50:09.097 --> 00:50:11.978]  entry into the war, in 1941, December 7th.
[00:50:13.078 --> 00:50:18.539]  She was on AM transmitters and shortwave transmitters that were on the ships, that the U.S.
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:28.462]  could hear, broadcast all over the Pacific, that we just sunk your aircraft carriers, you're losing, you're defeated, we're gonna invade the homeland, your wife is alone at home right now, she's cheating on you.
[00:50:30.563 --> 00:50:31.603]  Tokyo Rose.
[00:50:33.626 --> 00:50:34.586]  Yeah, there's Baghdad Bob.
[00:50:34.606 --> 00:50:36.167]  Guys, go to YouTube.
[00:50:36.407 --> 00:50:40.529]  Let's play a little Baghdad Bob in a minute and also try to pull up recordings of Tokyo Rose.
[00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:45.931]  She's like, here's some music from America and know your wife is cheating on you right now.
[00:50:46.612 --> 00:50:48.253]  And by the way, you've all been defeated.
[00:50:48.973 --> 00:51:00.278]  The day we dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, she was on air saying that the Japanese invaded the US mainland.
[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:07.571]  Because they knew as propagandists there were some weak-minded Americans that would believe that.
[00:51:08.533 --> 00:51:13.182]  The numbers are already coming out only two, three weeks into the trucker boycott that prices have exploded.
[00:51:14.246 --> 00:51:26.229]  The store shelves are half empty, everything's falling apart, they put troops on the streets, and then the media isn't talking about the trucker protest that's already had a huge effect.
[00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:28.630]  Why did Trudeau lock up the truckers?
[00:51:28.650 --> 00:51:29.550]  Because they had a huge effect.
[00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:33.551]  The truckers and the farmers are shutting stuff down and battling the Great Reset in Europe.
[00:51:33.871 --> 00:51:34.291]  So, no.
[00:51:34.891 --> 00:51:38.112]  They're never going to tell us about the victories, okay?
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:45.126]  You understand, when we were dropping atomic bombs on Japan, they were announcing they'd beaten us.
[00:51:46.046 --> 00:51:49.329]  Play, I'm going to put you on hold and let you come back, but let's play a clip of Baghdad Bomb.
[00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:49.649]  Here it is.
[00:51:55.835 --> 00:52:00.899]  Like I said, we got a new computer system today, and I know it was to fix the other one, but let's just get rid of this new computer system.
[00:52:00.919 --> 00:52:01.700]  Go ahead and put up audio.
[00:52:02.681 --> 00:52:02.881]  Please.
[00:52:08.442 --> 00:52:09.182]  Alright, I'm going to take a break.
[00:52:09.862 --> 00:52:10.362]  I'm not mad.
[00:52:12.343 --> 00:52:15.144]  They put a new computer system in and every clip is messed up.
[00:52:15.184 --> 00:52:15.884]  And I'm not complaining.
[00:52:16.264 --> 00:52:17.084]  Everybody understands that.
[00:52:17.124 --> 00:52:17.524]  It's cool.
[00:52:17.584 --> 00:52:18.024]  It's alright.
[00:52:18.064 --> 00:52:18.444]  It's whatever.
[00:52:18.824 --> 00:52:20.705]  Can we just go back to the previous system?
[00:52:20.845 --> 00:52:22.465]  Because this one obviously doesn't work.
[00:52:23.646 --> 00:52:23.846]  Alright?
[00:52:24.546 --> 00:52:26.446]  Let me know when you're ready with the Baghdad bomb clip.
[00:52:27.286 --> 00:52:28.467]  Alright, here's the Baghdad bomb clip.
[00:52:30.187 --> 00:52:32.108]  As-salamu alaykum.
[00:52:35.917 --> 00:52:45.584]  And a few farmers, a few peasants, brave peasants, had shot down two Apache helicopters.
[00:52:47.565 --> 00:52:54.089]  We've shown one of them on the Iraqi television only half an hour back.
[00:52:55.650 --> 00:53:03.496]  And maybe if we will find it convenient, maybe, maybe, we will show the pilots.
[00:53:05.805 --> 00:53:06.165]  Maybe.
[00:53:06.765 --> 00:53:07.465]  Or maybe not.
[00:53:09.546 --> 00:53:14.367]  They will protest again that we are violating Geneva Conventions.
[00:53:17.627 --> 00:53:23.829]  Their hands are still bloodstained with the Vietnamese blood.
[00:53:25.129 --> 00:53:32.110]  With all their aggressions all over the world and recently even women in Afghanistan.
[00:53:33.251 --> 00:53:35.571]  And they are talking about Geneva Conventions.
[00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:37.490]  Let's stop there.
[00:53:37.791 --> 00:53:39.251]  The crew's great.
[00:53:39.271 --> 00:53:44.434]  They just randomly pull up stuff when I call for it.
[00:53:44.474 --> 00:53:45.934]  That's not the good Baghdad bomb stuff.
[00:53:52.045 --> 00:54:00.872]  Baghdad Bob is standing there for hours while planes are dropping bombs behind him and tanks are moving in, in Baghdad, saying, we have driven them into the sea, they're defeated.
[00:54:01.232 --> 00:54:01.872]  That's my point.
[00:54:01.892 --> 00:54:03.113]  Anybody can look into Baghdad Bob.
[00:54:03.133 --> 00:54:04.314]  You can see it for yourself.
[00:54:04.354 --> 00:54:06.316]  We post this at Band Up Video or X later.
[00:54:06.616 --> 00:54:09.238]  We'll add, this is my fault, I'm moving quick here, the crew's trying to find it.
[00:54:09.538 --> 00:54:16.123]  We'll add the Baghdad Bob clips, we'll add the, oh, whatever her name is, Tokyo Rose clips to it.
[00:54:16.363 --> 00:54:17.764]  All right, I'm going to start the next hour.
[00:54:17.965 --> 00:54:18.925]  Thank you, Luke.
[00:54:18.965 --> 00:54:19.606]  Luke, anything else?
[00:54:21.142 --> 00:54:22.163]  Uh, by the product.
[00:54:22.183 --> 00:54:25.386]  So man, God bless you and your family.

[00:54:27.167 --> 00:54:27.868]  All right.

[01:00:15.171 --> 01:00:23.782]  If you fly over these areas that are burned to the ground, you'll see in the midst of 20 homes that are just totally destroyed, one home sitting there because it had the right roof on it.
[01:00:23.802 --> 01:00:31.692]  Yes, and by the way, if you notice you fly over in a helicopter, those places with roofs, they didn't burn.
[01:00:34.532 --> 01:00:36.773]  Joe Biden's recent comments are alarming.
[01:00:37.213 --> 01:00:40.174]  The average person isn't supposed to know that the U.S.
[01:00:40.234 --> 01:00:47.875]  and Chinese military have been testing field-ready ground and space-based dues or directed energy weapons for at least a decade.
[01:00:48.255 --> 01:00:54.717]  Instead, we are supposed to sit down and shut up and believe it is a Jewish space laser conspiracy theory.
[01:00:55.097 --> 01:01:01.279]  Can you tell me why so many people that support Donald Trump love conspiracy theories, including yourself?
[01:01:01.519 --> 01:01:02.940]  About Jewish space lasers.
[01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:04.660]  Tell us about Jewish space lasers.
[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:07.802]  No, why don't you go talk about Jewish space lasers?
[01:01:07.862 --> 01:01:08.842]  And really, why don't you f**k off?
[01:01:10.046 --> 01:01:11.047]  According to the U.S.
[01:01:11.107 --> 01:01:19.976]  Government Accountability Office, directed energy weapons can produce force that ranges from deterrent to damaging to destructive.
[01:01:20.357 --> 01:01:23.660]  Many countries, including the U.S., are researching their use.
[01:01:23.981 --> 01:01:28.045]  Different types of electromagnetic energy have different properties.
[01:01:28.365 --> 01:01:38.453]  High-energy lasers produce a very narrow beam of light, usually in the infrared to visible region, and are typically used on one target at a time.
[01:01:38.733 --> 01:01:44.998]  The beam can be pulsed or continuous, generating a power output of at least 1 kilowatt.
[01:01:45.098 --> 01:01:52.084]  This output is 200,000 times greater than a typical laser pointer and is capable of melting steel.
[01:01:52.244 --> 01:01:53.985]  Evidence of a CCP satellite over Maui is known.
[01:02:22.244 --> 01:02:22.845]  I don't know.
[01:02:39.648 --> 01:02:44.913]  That is overwhelming evidence that should be admissible in a court of law.
[01:02:45.373 --> 01:02:48.716]  In China, CCP now is just releasing data on their petawatt lasers.
[01:02:48.996 --> 01:02:52.759]  They're doing petawatt laser bursts on a laser that fits on a lab table.
[01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:54.721]  It's not a very big laser, basically.
[01:02:54.801 --> 01:02:59.545]  But when you have lasers of this energy, it's just instant damage.
[01:03:00.106 --> 01:03:01.387]  Very, very powerful lasers.
[01:03:01.707 --> 01:03:13.763]  Some extraordinary damage in our state could be caused by hurricanes or tornadoes and frequently when you see the aftermath of that damage, there's a some semblance of a structure that is still there.
[01:03:14.024 --> 01:03:18.289]  When you look at the damages that have occurred here, this is gone.
[01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:19.471]  Completely gone.
[01:03:19.611 --> 01:03:39.287]  And as we realize that the government is, at the very least, complicit in the COVID vaccine genocide, what makes you think that they wouldn't use dues, supported by lawfare, to drive people off their land, to cordon the population into smart cities, in order to quicken United Nations Agenda 2030?
[01:03:40.413 --> 01:03:42.435]  It's not something you see every day.
[01:03:42.455 --> 01:03:43.896]  Oh geez, it was soft.
[01:03:44.617 --> 01:03:45.658]  I mean, it went back and forth.
[01:03:46.259 --> 01:03:48.641]  At least, I would say 40 minutes to an hour.
[01:03:48.961 --> 01:03:52.465]  But for people living in Cape Coral, they've been seeing it a lot this week.
[01:03:52.845 --> 01:03:53.586]  It was really late at night.
[01:03:53.606 --> 01:03:54.907]  It was kind of around midnight.
[01:03:55.187 --> 01:03:56.168]  It was around midnight.
[01:03:56.449 --> 01:03:58.030]  I was actually in my car.
[01:03:58.511 --> 01:04:02.134]  I was just getting home and I saw it going back and forth with a laser beam.
[01:04:02.515 --> 01:04:04.496]  It scanned over me multiple times.
[01:04:05.517 --> 01:04:10.260]  And it was just moving, it was scanning the whole area, every square footage basically.
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:15.803]  When it came by, you could see the green laser light like spread out, like it was mapping.
[01:04:16.184 --> 01:04:18.705]  We heard someone was mapping the areas when we were told.
[01:04:19.025 --> 01:04:27.751]  When you put the information Casey provided into the FAA website, it comes back with this information saying it's registered to Randigo LLC.
[01:04:28.251 --> 01:04:31.373]  But it's unclear who or what they're doing.
[01:04:31.653 --> 01:04:33.834]  We just want to know what's going on, why we're being scanned.
[01:04:34.975 --> 01:04:54.840]  Furthermore, wouldn't a covert satellite-based laser weapon in concert with known weather modification technology capable of waging mass murder, land theft, and agricultural devastation benefit the Great Reset greatly by merely hiding behind the climate change narrative?

[01:06:43.182 --> 01:06:44.303]  We're taking your phone calls.
[01:06:44.963 --> 01:06:46.805]  Let's talk to Justin in New York.
[01:06:46.885 --> 01:06:47.766]  Thank you so much.
[01:06:47.806 --> 01:06:48.246]  Go ahead.
[01:06:50.027 --> 01:06:51.389]  Alex, I love you, man.
[01:06:51.529 --> 01:06:52.109]  Love you too, brother.
[01:06:52.189 --> 01:06:55.672]  I've been listening for 10 years.
[01:06:55.772 --> 01:06:57.173]  Your products have changed my life.
[01:06:57.534 --> 01:06:58.955]  And you know what?
[01:06:59.035 --> 01:07:00.016]  I was down in Tampa.
[01:07:00.703 --> 01:07:01.223]  At the river.
[01:07:01.243 --> 01:07:02.463]  I'm a river person.
[01:07:03.044 --> 01:07:04.524]  And I'm born and raised in Kingston.
[01:07:04.564 --> 01:07:05.924]  I'm right down the street from Gerald.
[01:07:06.184 --> 01:07:09.505]  And I missed, I missed your, uh, the Alex night.
[01:07:10.085 --> 01:07:11.146]  Cause I backslid.
[01:07:11.246 --> 01:07:14.086]  I was at a campsite and I really wanted to meet you.
[01:07:14.186 --> 01:07:14.907]  But you know what?
[01:07:15.227 --> 01:07:17.847]  I hear you saying like, you, you already know how it ends.
[01:07:18.007 --> 01:07:18.767]  We win, man.
[01:07:18.948 --> 01:07:19.728]  We win.
[01:07:20.188 --> 01:07:21.408]  And that's the bottom line.
[01:07:21.468 --> 01:07:24.789]  We went and, uh, you know,
[01:07:25.823 --> 01:07:27.124]  I don't know what else to say, man.
[01:07:27.204 --> 01:07:28.265]  We just, we win.
[01:07:28.405 --> 01:07:31.529]  And I just keep praying, God, you gotta lead me, guide me.
[01:07:32.458 --> 01:07:34.599]  And he just keeps providing, man.
[01:07:35.099 --> 01:07:36.600]  I'm not out here looking for money.
[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:38.001]  Money's out looking for me.
[01:07:38.521 --> 01:07:44.344]  And it's just amazing how I just keep getting blessed and highly favored.
[01:07:44.664 --> 01:07:46.825]  And that's the bottom line, man.
[01:07:46.845 --> 01:07:48.306]  I just want to tell you I love you, man.
[01:07:48.326 --> 01:07:52.888]  I love you, too, and I really, really, really appreciate you calling in, brother.
[01:07:52.908 --> 01:07:53.769]  Thank you, Justin.
[01:07:54.089 --> 01:07:55.270]  Let's go to Ben in Wisconsin.
[01:07:55.290 --> 01:07:55.770]  You're on the air.
[01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:56.070]  Go ahead.
[01:07:56.090 --> 01:07:59.012]  Can you hear me?
[01:07:59.352 --> 01:07:59.712]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:08:01.655 --> 01:08:04.616]  I wanted your input on the younger generation.
[01:08:04.676 --> 01:08:26.363]  I haven't heard you talk too much about them, but with things like fluoride atrazine, everything that we ingest still in the water system, with things like acetaminophen having been linked to autism, all the things with vaccine, they've kind of engineered a generation to not only have a
[01:08:27.967 --> 01:08:55.398]  Born lower attention span but with like reels and tic-tac and everything we now have attention span lower than a goldfish and it's almost like they've created a lost generation where people that I've talked to they all know these things and people are looking for a purpose in life when it seems like they know the purpose because they know these things but they just
[01:08:56.741 --> 01:08:59.062]  Don't think that there's anything to be done.
[01:09:02.464 --> 01:09:03.344]  Absolutely, brother.
[01:09:03.564 --> 01:09:04.085]  Absolutely.
[01:09:04.105 --> 01:09:19.132]  I just wanted to see how you would react to that, because I haven't... I'm 23, and I've... Well, you've said a couple things.
[01:09:19.212 --> 01:09:20.393]  React specifically to what?
[01:09:22.974 --> 01:09:23.574]  Just how...
[01:09:26.297 --> 01:09:27.598]  What our generation should do.
[01:09:28.138 --> 01:09:35.383]  I mean it seems like we know this stuff but it's not like they have the full realization of it.
[01:09:35.944 --> 01:09:37.425]  Well I mean that's a big question.
[01:09:37.485 --> 01:09:48.553]  People should get close to God and not worry about the system or people think of them and just get healthy and none of us are perfect and just love our families and realize that's what matters is our soul
[01:09:49.818 --> 01:09:52.339]  Not even, you know, where our position is in the world.
[01:09:52.359 --> 01:09:54.619]  I mean, Hollywood's all about worshipping the system.
[01:09:54.659 --> 01:09:56.160]  We should be the opposite of Hollywood.
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:56.920]  I appreciate your call.
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:01.361]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Jana in Canada.
[01:10:01.381 --> 01:10:02.181]  Jana, you're on the air.
[01:10:02.221 --> 01:10:02.541]  Welcome.
[01:10:03.821 --> 01:10:04.442]  Hi, Alex.
[01:10:04.482 --> 01:10:05.082]  How are you?
[01:10:05.282 --> 01:10:09.203]  I'm going to try not to fangirl too much here on you.
[01:10:10.623 --> 01:10:12.784]  Yeah, I live on the east coast of Canada.
[01:10:13.504 --> 01:10:18.125]  And in the cities in Canada, it's basically liberal strongholds.
[01:10:19.352 --> 01:10:31.761]  Now my dad was an old school liberal and if he were alive today, he's been gone since 88, he would roll over in his grave to see what Justin Trudeau is doing to our country.
[01:10:32.842 --> 01:10:41.908]  The thing that really has got me the most is what the Canadian government is trying to do right now with crushing free speech online.
[01:10:42.388 --> 01:10:43.349]  What do you think of that?
[01:10:44.878 --> 01:10:48.240]  Well, Trudeau is the World Economic Forum model of tyranny.
[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:49.581]  He says he wants to be a dictator.
[01:10:50.001 --> 01:10:51.662]  He wants life in prison for free speech.
[01:10:53.023 --> 01:10:54.524]  Canada is about to become North Korea.
[01:10:54.884 --> 01:10:55.824]  I mean, it's real.
[01:10:56.885 --> 01:10:57.525]  Absolutely.
[01:10:57.986 --> 01:11:00.267]  And people think, oh, it'll never happen to Canada or America.
[01:11:00.767 --> 01:11:01.788]  It is happening.
[01:11:01.808 --> 01:11:02.728]  I don't think it's going to work.
[01:11:03.229 --> 01:11:04.489]  Our culture doesn't work that way.
[01:11:04.529 --> 01:11:08.852]  The Koreans are great, smart people, but they, like the Germans, historically follow orders.
[01:11:10.009 --> 01:11:16.394]  So that can be a really... Korea is the most productive South Korea per capita, the most productive company in the world per person.
[01:11:17.215 --> 01:11:24.080]  But they have the highest vaccine rate, they have the highest autism rate, even South Korea is somewhat free compared to the North, but it's cult run.
[01:11:25.081 --> 01:11:31.105]  And so North Korea was able to create total enslavement because the Koreans were kind of primed for that.
[01:11:31.646 --> 01:11:33.867]  Well, we're not primed for that, but they're trying.
[01:11:35.489 --> 01:11:37.710]  Well, I'm a happily un-vaxxed person.
[01:11:37.810 --> 01:11:41.491]  I refuse to take the vaccine and I refuse to fall for the B.F.
[01:11:41.531 --> 01:11:42.691]  that they were pushing here.
[01:11:43.432 --> 01:11:46.293]  And yeah, Trudeau is definitely a W.E.F.
[01:11:46.313 --> 01:11:47.593]  plant.
[01:11:48.033 --> 01:11:52.355]  And so are most, in the West, all the leftist governments.
[01:11:52.395 --> 01:11:53.495]  They're all W.E.F.
[01:11:53.535 --> 01:11:53.855]  plants.
[01:11:54.355 --> 01:11:56.476]  And I pray, I love
[01:11:57.310 --> 01:12:00.155]  Trump and I wish I'd been an American.
[01:12:00.195 --> 01:12:03.981]  I would have voted for him in 2016, 2020, which I do think he won.
[01:12:04.001 --> 01:12:08.287]  And I pray that America gets back on track in 2024 because
[01:12:09.736 --> 01:12:12.358]  The way America goes will be the way the rest of us go.
[01:12:12.819 --> 01:12:18.383]  And we've got to get, like, freedom-loving people back and running these countries.
[01:12:18.744 --> 01:12:20.485]  And we've got to get Trudeau out and gone.
[01:12:20.505 --> 01:12:21.486]  What do you think of that?
[01:12:21.506 --> 01:12:22.647]  Well, I mean, take Canada.
[01:12:22.787 --> 01:12:24.829]  He got elected with 20% because of Parliament.
[01:12:24.849 --> 01:12:26.930]  He can manipulate and get sub-parties to put him in.
[01:12:27.251 --> 01:12:32.235]  Yeah, no, Canada's really waking up, doing a great job, and we love Canadians, and I think you're going to turn it around.
[01:12:32.255 --> 01:12:33.296]  I mean, we have to.
[01:12:33.336 --> 01:12:34.296]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:12:34.577 --> 01:12:35.858]  Trudeau has hated all the world now.
[01:12:35.918 --> 01:12:36.618]  So has Klaus Schwab.
[01:12:37.079 --> 01:12:38.460]  What they're selling is horrible.
[01:12:40.475 --> 01:12:41.275]  Let's take another call.
[01:12:41.355 --> 01:12:42.175]  Robert in Florida.
[01:12:42.195 --> 01:12:42.655]  You're on the air.
[01:12:42.675 --> 01:12:43.215]  Go ahead, Robert.
[01:12:44.576 --> 01:12:45.316]  Hey, Alex.
[01:12:45.336 --> 01:12:46.216]  How are you doing today?
[01:12:46.236 --> 01:12:47.316]  Good.
[01:12:47.356 --> 01:12:50.077]  Go ahead.
[01:12:50.317 --> 01:12:54.337]  One thing I wanted to bring up was Biden's misspeak.
[01:12:54.477 --> 01:13:06.199]  To me, it almost seems like he's trying to get the truth out, but I think he's so drugged up and he comes and goes out of his, you know, dementia or whatever that I think it's, you know, an almost Freudian flip.
[01:13:06.239 --> 01:13:09.840]  But I keep almost trying to get it out because when he was talking to whoever at the
[01:13:11.075 --> 01:13:15.956]  The speech that night, it looked like he was trying to explain it to him, like, you know, this is what's happening.
[01:13:16.096 --> 01:13:21.038]  So, I don't know if they're just allowing him to do this to make it look like he's going crazy.
[01:13:23.898 --> 01:13:27.019]  My second question is, my wife... Hey, you were breaking up there.
[01:13:27.059 --> 01:13:28.059]  What was the first question?
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:37.622]  On Biden's speech after he misspeaks, but it almost seems like he's trying to put out the truth.
[01:13:38.618 --> 01:13:46.104]  Well, he's so senile that he knows the truth, so he's not good at lying anymore, but yeah, I agree with you.
[01:13:46.204 --> 01:14:01.916]  My second question for you is, my wife had two children during the pandemic, and our first child, she had to have blood transfusion, and our third child, in 2023, I asked the doctor about contaminated blood, and he just was like, I don't know what you mean.
[01:14:01.976 --> 01:14:03.517]  And I said, well, what's the vaccine?
[01:14:03.537 --> 01:14:05.639]  And he said, why would the vaccine be in the blood?
[01:14:07.085 --> 01:14:18.170]  I've noticed some changes in my wife.
[01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:23.793]  I mean, just maybe a little bit aggressive behavior and things like that, but it could be, you know, with everything we're going through.
[01:14:23.993 --> 01:14:26.654]  Well, there's no doubt those shots create nanotech in the body.
[01:14:26.694 --> 01:14:28.235]  There are ways to try to mitigate it.
[01:14:28.255 --> 01:14:29.816]  There's no known cure yet.
[01:14:30.296 --> 01:14:34.018]  There's a lot of things that are known to purify the blood and try to get that stuff out of there.
[01:14:34.058 --> 01:14:35.339]  Thank you so much, sir, and God bless you.
[01:14:35.981 --> 01:14:43.305]  Alright, we're going to go on a break, and then we're going to come back and go to Aaron, and everybody else in the order your call was received.
[01:14:43.385 --> 01:14:50.849]  It's Aaron, and then it's Matt, and then it's Marcos, and Jonathan, and everybody else.
[01:14:50.889 --> 01:14:54.331]  So, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[01:14:54.712 --> 01:14:57.153]  And it just hit Bloomberg and all the newspapers.
[01:14:57.593 --> 01:15:00.255]  Info wars to be imminently shut down.
[01:15:01.635 --> 01:15:04.257]  And I love when I warn people that
[01:15:06.044 --> 01:15:08.586]  Some people blame me saying I would do it.
[01:15:10.207 --> 01:15:12.889]  Yeah, you're looking at the good guy here, folks.
[01:15:13.109 --> 01:15:19.273]  The spin is in overdrive, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:20.634 --> 01:15:21.655]  Because they're making their move.
[01:15:22.396 --> 01:15:25.278]  I don't get up here and tell you that we could be shut down imminently.
[01:15:25.298 --> 01:15:28.960]  I mean, even if they make the shutdown order, we might be on air another month, two, three.
[01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:29.441]  Who knows?
[01:15:29.521 --> 01:15:30.842]  I can work with a Chapter 7 person.
[01:15:30.862 --> 01:15:31.902]  But this is it.
[01:15:32.783 --> 01:15:33.924]  And it's happening in a lifetime.
[01:15:35.529 --> 01:15:38.270]  It's like Project Veritas and it's takeover on steroids.
[01:15:39.950 --> 01:15:41.031]  But here's the good news.
[01:15:41.511 --> 01:15:42.411]  They ain't shutting me down.
[01:15:43.732 --> 01:15:43.972]  Alright?
[01:15:44.792 --> 01:15:45.892]  All they do is hurt the crew.
[01:15:46.153 --> 01:15:46.833]  And hurt themselves.
[01:15:47.573 --> 01:15:48.453]  But that's what they're doing.
[01:15:49.134 --> 01:15:53.915]  So, so is life, as the French say, c'est la vie.
[01:15:54.815 --> 01:15:55.656]  Your coup failed.
[01:15:59.462 --> 01:16:00.742]  But it all boils down to this.
[01:16:01.142 --> 01:16:04.243]  We're bringing you hardcore information on the New World Order.
[01:16:04.563 --> 01:16:08.324]  We told you about lockdowns and poison shots that would attack your immune system decades before.
[01:16:08.764 --> 01:16:10.284]  We exposed Bohemian Grove first.
[01:16:10.364 --> 01:16:12.345]  We exposed 9-11 before it happened.
[01:16:12.685 --> 01:16:16.326]  I am in the zeitgeist, but I cannot continue to fight the globals without your support.
[01:16:16.666 --> 01:16:23.087]  So spread this report, spread this video, and get great products you need at the same time funding our operation at InfoWarstore.com.

[01:16:38.859 --> 01:16:39.639]  It is amazing.
[01:16:39.719 --> 01:16:40.420]  Nitric Boost.

[01:17:10.578 --> 01:17:14.239]  Nitric oxide is an important chemical messenger in the body.
[01:17:14.799 --> 01:17:19.160]  It promotes blood flow, and it helps nerve cells communicate with one another.
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:22.941]  But over time, our bodies produce less of it.
[01:17:24.322 --> 01:17:32.528]  Full of amino acids to produce nitric oxide, Nitric Boost helps raise the amount of nitric oxide in your body.
[01:17:33.669 --> 01:17:40.054]  Nitric oxide is needed for strength, cardiovascular function, and healthy neurotransmission.
[01:17:41.094 --> 01:17:45.478]  It helps to improve blood flow, which helps improve overall immunity.

[01:17:59.198 --> 01:18:04.920]  I'm not perfect, and I'm under a lot of stress, but if I didn't have the supplements we have, we promote, I wouldn't be able to continue to be on air.
[01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:13.622]  And when you go to mfulwardstore.com, you are funding the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists in an operation that the enemy admits has been the most effective at exposing them.
[01:18:13.822 --> 01:18:15.422]  Because we're fearless, and we don't back down.
[01:18:15.783 --> 01:18:16.763]  We got God on our side.

[01:18:24.805 --> 01:18:27.766]  Nitric Boost, without me even knowing, became our number three bestseller.
[01:18:28.466 --> 01:18:30.068]  Because people loved it so much.
[01:18:30.088 --> 01:18:31.029]  They had such great effects.
[01:18:31.329 --> 01:18:37.495]  Got all these natural compounds that clean out the blood, open up your arteries and veins, the capillators, clean out your heart, your brain, everything.
[01:18:38.296 --> 01:18:40.038]  Well, we got an even better manufacturer.
[01:18:40.058 --> 01:18:44.882]  The other one was great, but one that's even better with even higher quality ingredients at a lower price.
[01:18:45.883 --> 01:18:49.804]  So I could never offer Nitric Boost because it cost us so much to make.
[01:18:50.605 --> 01:18:52.825]  And now we can offer it for 40% off.

[01:20:20.406 --> 01:20:23.869]  We're good to go.
[01:20:54.838 --> 01:21:02.442]  Well, Bloomberg is now reporting, as I told you Friday, and on Tucker Thursday and Sunday, to shut down Infowars.
[01:21:02.522 --> 01:21:03.442]  Bloomberg, U.S.
[01:21:03.482 --> 01:21:05.463]  trustee moves to shut us down.
[01:21:08.745 --> 01:21:09.185]  Told you.
[01:21:10.986 --> 01:21:11.427]  Told you.
[01:21:12.547 --> 01:21:17.350]  And some people around here got mad at me when I told them and thought I was the problem.
[01:21:18.410 --> 01:21:19.070]  What fools.
[01:21:21.472 --> 01:21:23.853]  Absolutely insane, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:27.080]  They're coming after everybody, folks.
[01:21:29.941 --> 01:21:34.202]  And it's because they know they've lost the people's support.
[01:21:35.462 --> 01:21:36.323]  They're in full panic mode.
[01:21:36.503 --> 01:21:41.744]  I don't want to get into this with callers because I've got to study it more, but I'll definitely put statements out on this soon.
[01:21:42.664 --> 01:21:48.186]  But imagine what happened to Project Veritas with James O'Keefe times, let's not exaggerate, 100.
[01:21:48.326 --> 01:21:53.667]  I mean, when I tell you everything, it's so insane.
[01:21:55.011 --> 01:21:57.253]  When I figured out this was going on, I began to document.
[01:21:59.835 --> 01:22:08.523]  So I got a lot of documentation and let's just say this, people aren't going to be pleased.
[01:22:11.305 --> 01:22:17.611]  So it's hard to continue the show at this point, but we know what we're here.
[01:22:17.631 --> 01:22:19.253]  I, uh,
[01:22:21.857 --> 01:22:25.399]  They filed a deal to be able to fire me anytime yesterday.
[01:22:25.419 --> 01:22:27.821]  They want an emergency hearing next week.
[01:22:27.841 --> 01:22:29.282]  They could lock me out of the building anytime.
[01:22:31.743 --> 01:22:32.864]  And I do care about my kids.
[01:22:33.284 --> 01:22:35.465]  You know, paintings they did when they were little kids and stuff in my office.
[01:22:35.485 --> 01:22:36.506]  And I care about the crew.
[01:22:37.307 --> 01:22:42.390]  So I'm literally at the point now where I'm like, any day I wait, I've got to get a trailer here and get my stuff out.
[01:22:42.630 --> 01:22:43.490]  Doesn't mean I'm quitting.
[01:22:43.911 --> 01:22:44.671]  They'll lock me out.
[01:22:44.931 --> 01:22:45.432]  They've said that.
[01:22:45.472 --> 01:22:46.952]  They said, you don't run this company.
[01:22:46.973 --> 01:22:47.513]  You're nobody.
[01:22:49.229 --> 01:22:54.173]  By the way, you're not going to have any Second Amendment shoots, like you go out and do gun shoots and stuff.
[01:22:54.754 --> 01:22:55.475]  We don't support that.
[01:22:55.515 --> 01:22:56.896]  I said, I have free speech.
[01:22:56.956 --> 01:22:57.657]  This is my company.
[01:22:58.117 --> 01:22:58.557]  No, you don't.
[01:22:59.278 --> 01:23:00.879]  I've been biting my tongue for three months on that.
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:05.764]  I mean, this is Project Veritas, but Keith did really smart stuff.
[01:23:05.784 --> 01:23:09.567]  He exposed them, but he went right to confronting them and it blew up in a month.
[01:23:09.607 --> 01:23:11.008]  This has been going on for six months.
[01:23:16.096 --> 01:23:19.137]  It's, it's remember O'Keefe ate somebody's sandwich.
[01:23:19.257 --> 01:23:19.977]  It's stuff like that.
[01:23:21.297 --> 01:23:23.878]  And it's, it's, it's wild.
[01:23:24.158 --> 01:23:26.839]  So, hey man, legendary.
[01:23:26.939 --> 01:23:28.479]  InfoWars lives on no matter what.
[01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:32.400]  The enemy takes this operation down, only makes it 10 times bigger.
[01:23:33.341 --> 01:23:36.081]  And, and I'll, I'll do my best however we come back to bring the crew back.
[01:23:36.161 --> 01:23:38.162]  But I mean, it's just really, really sad.
[01:23:39.451 --> 01:23:43.672]  I can tell you, any orders you put in InfoWarsTore.com, even if they do a Chapter 7, they'll all get shipped.
[01:23:43.712 --> 01:23:45.232]  It'll take six months to shut it completely down.
[01:23:45.692 --> 01:23:49.173]  I'll probably be a nice guy and just stay here and do that to hear about time to get another job.
[01:23:50.153 --> 01:23:51.573]  But that's where we are.
[01:23:51.753 --> 01:23:55.834]  So this is probably, I'd say, 90% chance the end of InfoWars.
[01:23:55.894 --> 01:23:56.114]  Okay?
[01:23:56.194 --> 01:23:58.074]  I told you, I don't just say stuff.
[01:23:58.434 --> 01:24:00.555]  I don't hype things up with a lot of drama queens, folks.
[01:24:01.295 --> 01:24:06.436]  I told you, and I told you, and I told you, and I told you, and I told you.
[01:24:10.919 --> 01:24:12.640]  Alright, I'm not ready to talk about this yet.
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:22.767]  I need to be able to... I've already been thinking about it a lot, but I gotta get my ducks in a row before we talk about it, but... I can be locked out of the building tomorrow.
[01:24:24.068 --> 01:24:26.389]  So, this could be my last show right now here.
[01:24:26.590 --> 01:24:26.910]  Alright?
[01:24:28.751 --> 01:24:29.051]  Sorry!
[01:24:30.052 --> 01:24:31.913]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk to Aaron in Texas.
[01:24:31.973 --> 01:24:32.594]  Aaron, you're on the air.
[01:24:32.634 --> 01:24:32.934]  Go ahead.
[01:24:34.829 --> 01:24:37.411]  Hi Alex, I'm sorry this happened to you man.
[01:24:37.591 --> 01:24:38.931]  It's happened to us all brother.
[01:24:38.951 --> 01:24:45.035]  At least we're not some 20 year old woman having her brains beat out and Obama or Biden apologizes to the killer.
[01:24:45.515 --> 01:24:47.336]  Listen, we didn't have, you know, I'm all right.
[01:24:47.376 --> 01:24:47.896]  I'm a big man.
[01:24:47.936 --> 01:24:50.858]  I knew this was coming, but I'm just, it's, it's, it's okay, brother.
[01:24:50.898 --> 01:24:51.158]  Thank you.
[01:24:51.198 --> 01:24:52.999]  Go ahead.
[01:24:53.559 --> 01:25:00.363]  Well, my other questions slash comment, uh, I know you said during lockdown that millions of people die of starvation.
[01:25:01.790 --> 01:25:06.072]  And it was going to take the FDA 10 to 12 years to approve a vaccine.
[01:25:06.792 --> 01:25:12.714]  That's why I was thinking that, you know, because of Operation Warp Speed, technically Trump saved millions of lives.
[01:25:12.734 --> 01:25:22.557]  Because if we were like that for 10 to 12 years, we probably, I wouldn't be here because they want to depopulate the whole world and bring the dispensers back into the currency and all this Green New Deal stuff.
[01:25:23.117 --> 01:25:26.158]  So it, I know you don't like it, but it did do a lot of good.
[01:25:26.478 --> 01:25:28.299]  And I don't think we, I think that, uh,
[01:25:29.212 --> 01:25:37.614]  Trump probably needs more support, I guess, and we probably shouldn't, like, tackle it a little too much, because the mass murder media, like, that's what their job is.
[01:25:37.654 --> 01:25:41.255]  They murder your character, they murder your soul.
[01:25:42.335 --> 01:25:43.275]  Let me just say something.
[01:25:44.275 --> 01:25:50.236]  You've done a better job than I did last night trying to take Trump to the woodshed in saying what I already know is true.
[01:25:50.436 --> 01:25:51.117]  I know Trump.
[01:25:51.257 --> 01:25:51.957]  I know the moves.
[01:25:52.097 --> 01:25:52.857]  I watched it all.
[01:25:52.917 --> 01:25:53.577]  I know the players.
[01:25:53.597 --> 01:25:54.177]  You're absolutely right.
[01:25:55.357 --> 01:25:57.198]  They came to Trump to manipulate him.
[01:25:58.470 --> 01:26:00.411]  And said, this is super deadly.
[01:26:00.451 --> 01:26:02.132]  It's going to kill billions of people or whatever.
[01:26:02.193 --> 01:26:03.794]  They over exaggerated it times a hundred.
[01:26:04.714 --> 01:26:07.036]  And we will never get a vaccine.
[01:26:07.736 --> 01:26:11.899]  And they had another advisor go, sir, we have this MRNA and it's totally safe.
[01:26:11.959 --> 01:26:23.246]  And so he signed off on it because he believed that a lockdown destroying the world economy, which the UN admits 80 something million starved to death, even though it was only shorter than what would have happened.
[01:26:23.286 --> 01:26:25.508]  Trump, that's exactly what Trump's calculus.
[01:26:26.598 --> 01:26:30.043]  Yeah, I think he will, but I think it's all timed out, you know, in increments because everybody's so...
[01:26:41.894 --> 01:26:47.197]  You don't want to wake up, like I still to this day, I tell people about Dr. Clover, he's like, haha, you talking about bleach.
[01:26:47.457 --> 01:26:49.198]  I'm like, you didn't say drink bleach.
[01:26:49.558 --> 01:26:50.118]  I got it right here.
[01:26:50.158 --> 01:26:50.779]  I don't want to see that.
[01:26:50.799 --> 01:26:53.140]  I'm like, well dang, what can I do to wake, tell you?
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:56.942]  No, it's like you said, a lot of good people coming across the border, but some are really, really bad people.
[01:26:57.222 --> 01:26:58.523]  They said every Mexican's bad.
[01:26:58.563 --> 01:26:59.103]  He didn't say that.
[01:27:00.424 --> 01:27:00.624]  Yeah.
[01:27:01.024 --> 01:27:02.184]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:27:02.985 --> 01:27:06.647]  It's just, to me, the mass murder media is the worst thing to ever happen.
[01:27:06.687 --> 01:27:08.768]  I think man was doing fine before they came along.
[01:27:08.868 --> 01:27:10.929]  Even back in the old days, the western days.
[01:27:11.448 --> 01:27:13.310]  We were signed before they came along with all these lies.
[01:27:13.810 --> 01:27:13.930]  Yeah.
[01:27:13.970 --> 01:27:15.471]  Yeah, I hope he does come on one more time.
[01:27:15.491 --> 01:27:17.613]  Because I remember the first time he came on, I hope he does.
[01:27:17.693 --> 01:27:19.034]  You know, that would be awesome.
[01:27:19.094 --> 01:27:19.395]  Yeah.
[01:27:19.415 --> 01:27:19.555]  Oh.
[01:27:41.547 --> 01:27:43.688]  Yeah.
[01:27:43.828 --> 01:27:45.449]  Have you ever heard Trump admit he was wrong?
[01:27:47.649 --> 01:27:48.950]  No, he didn't.
[01:27:49.470 --> 01:27:50.310]  No, I haven't.
[01:27:50.431 --> 01:27:52.131]  Yeah, because he won't admit to how he is.
[01:27:52.611 --> 01:27:53.392]  I'm different than him.
[01:27:54.032 --> 01:27:56.313]  When I'm wrong, I'll admit it because I want to own up to it.
[01:27:56.373 --> 01:27:57.253]  I'm not saying Trump's bad.
[01:27:57.293 --> 01:28:02.175]  It's not about, I just, man, I just, the shots are really bad.
[01:28:02.195 --> 01:28:04.036]  And now he's like, oh, the shots are great, they cure cancer.
[01:28:04.056 --> 01:28:05.096]  That's their next big thing.
[01:28:05.336 --> 01:28:08.418]  And so I'm just trying to put pressure on him so he'll stop it.
[01:28:08.438 --> 01:28:08.978]  Does that make sense?
[01:28:10.404 --> 01:28:12.044]  Yeah, it makes total sense.
[01:28:12.464 --> 01:28:18.946]  And I just wanted to say, I pray that the Lord Jesus protect you and keep you and give you strength and comfort through this whole trial.
[01:28:19.466 --> 01:28:21.926]  I bought plenty of products in the search in the past.
[01:28:21.966 --> 01:28:26.047]  You know, my money's been short and I ain't been able to find it, but still later... I understand we're in a depression, brother.
[01:28:26.127 --> 01:28:31.508]  You held us here and it worked out in God's plan now that all these other doors have opened right at the time.
[01:28:31.548 --> 01:28:33.749]  It's like one door closes, all these other doors open.
[01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:35.709]  Thank you so much and I love you, Aaron.
[01:28:35.729 --> 01:28:35.989]  Thank you.
[01:28:37.609 --> 01:28:39.911]  Oh my god, this is a lot to process.
[01:28:39.931 --> 01:28:41.532]  I already knew this was going down, but man.
[01:28:42.953 --> 01:28:46.756]  Yeah, they're, uh... U.S.
[01:28:46.776 --> 01:28:48.358]  trustee says shut him for wars down.
[01:28:49.599 --> 01:28:50.359]  Told you it was coming.
[01:28:52.381 --> 01:28:52.701]  Told you.

[01:30:54.224 --> 01:30:56.085]  InfoWarsTore.com, Turbo Force.
[01:30:58.908 --> 01:31:01.190]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[01:31:01.351 --> 01:31:01.691]  Thank you.
[01:31:01.891 --> 01:31:04.454]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[01:31:04.514 --> 01:31:05.775]  I started taking that stuff.
[01:31:05.815 --> 01:31:09.018]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[01:31:09.138 --> 01:31:10.019]  When did you start taking that?
[01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:14.243]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[01:31:14.924 --> 01:31:17.606]  And I started eating a little better, but my blood pressure stayed high.
[01:31:17.626 --> 01:31:25.151]  And when I took X2 iodine, after about three or four weeks, I think my body was detoxified of a bunch of metals and stuff that my body was storing.
[01:31:25.271 --> 01:31:27.473]  And my blood pressure came down to the perfect level.
[01:31:27.853 --> 01:31:30.835]  And I tell people the only thing I did was X2 iodine.
[01:31:31.255 --> 01:31:45.147]  And even though I do think all your other products are good, I recommend to anybody that they start with X2 Iodine because it detoxifies your body and kind of kicks your natural DNA into full force.
[01:31:45.227 --> 01:31:48.730]  So, in my life, I found X2 Iodine to be best.
[01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:52.613]  I tried other iodines and they didn't have the same effect.
[01:31:52.914 --> 01:31:55.216]  So, X2 Iodine, I really wanted to point that out.
[01:31:59.724 --> 01:32:02.646]  Have you tried taking the Real Red Pill?
[01:32:02.846 --> 01:32:08.690]  A one-of-a-kind heart and brain formula designed exclusively for InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:13.553]  One of the most powerful ingredients in Real Red Pill Plus is Pregnanolone.
[01:32:13.793 --> 01:32:21.758]  Pregnanolone levels decrease with age, and low levels are associated with fatigue, low brain function, and unhealthy aging.
[01:32:21.938 --> 01:32:25.861]  The Real Red Pill Plus also provides essential trace minerals,
[01:32:26.181 --> 01:32:26.842]  We're good to go.
[01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:04.544]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:33:05.066 --> 01:33:06.371]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:33:23.076 --> 01:33:29.118]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.478 --> 01:33:37.820]  I should say, not to be dark, but human beings, among other unique qualities, are also the only species that commit suicide.
[01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:38.461]  You're right.
[01:33:39.082 --> 01:33:39.402]  Well, exactly.
[01:33:39.422 --> 01:33:41.226]  We have that paradox because we control our environment.
[01:33:41.827 --> 01:33:43.169]  What animal would think to commit suicide?
[01:33:43.530 --> 01:33:47.016]  I mean, lemmings run off a cliff on accident, buffalo do, but they don't do it on purpose.
[01:33:47.597 --> 01:33:48.238]  Very well said.
[01:33:48.579 --> 01:33:49.040]  Exactly.
[01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:50.102]  So we have that heaven and hell.
[01:33:50.905 --> 01:33:53.086]  We have that potential of the little g god.
[01:33:54.788 --> 01:34:03.473]  What science fiction writers like Jules Verne 140 years ago wrote about, like rockets that take off, go to the moon, and come back and land again, Elon Musk has done it.
[01:34:03.773 --> 01:34:12.939]  Whatever we can envision, it's not like Oprah's Secret where it instantly happens, but with the potential of technology and society, and like Elon says, a big enough population.
[01:34:12.979 --> 01:34:16.462]  You need billions to build infrastructures that can do anything.
[01:34:17.162 --> 01:34:24.943]  And then once you realize the planet's tiny, and there's hundreds of billions of galaxies that are close, I mean, we can see, then you go, oh my god, we're like embryonic right now.
[01:34:24.963 --> 01:34:25.725]  We're like a tadpole.
[01:34:26.923 --> 01:34:33.007]  And we're not just going to turn into a frog, we're going to turn into a butterfly, that turns into a spaceship, that turns into a god, basically.
[01:34:33.388 --> 01:34:36.630]  And so we're a tadpole right now, we can do anything.
[01:34:36.930 --> 01:34:46.817]  And they're trying to tell us, no, you're scum, you're ugly, you're racist, kill each other, because the globalists want to extract out of us that essence of infinity that God's given us, that God essence.
[01:34:46.837 --> 01:34:50.400]  We're not God, but we're little g, that the first book of the Bible tells us.
[01:34:50.940 --> 01:35:02.125]  They want to extract that and use that for their life extension, their empowerment, their greedy control, instead of all of us sharing this incredible magic metamorphosis we're about to have.
[01:35:02.365 --> 01:35:07.107]  And they're trying to block the birth pains of what we're about to become, but I can tell them, you're going to fail.
[01:35:10.048 --> 01:35:15.230]  I mean, when they go after the interesting people, that's when you know you're in trouble.
[01:35:16.147 --> 01:35:17.788]  I always think that about what they did to you.
[01:35:17.869 --> 01:35:21.552]  Alex Jones, you've greatly improved and enlivened us.
[01:35:21.572 --> 01:35:21.892]  Thank you.
[01:35:21.912 --> 01:35:22.933]  Tucker, thanks for having me on the show.
[01:35:22.953 --> 01:35:23.894]  For your wisdom, are you kidding?
[01:35:23.994 --> 01:35:27.256]  I'm at Infowars.com right now, and we're very close to being shut down.
[01:35:27.537 --> 01:35:29.018]  But just like Tucker, it's going to be okay.
[01:35:29.378 --> 01:35:36.144]  But it's like they say in Empire Strikes Back, Imperial troops enter the base at Infowars, so I'm about to get taken out, but it's okay, I love you.
[01:35:39.747 --> 01:35:40.147]  The best.
[01:35:41.068 --> 01:35:43.130]  If by Rudyard Kipling,
[01:35:46.428 --> 01:35:52.230]  If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you.
[01:35:52.991 --> 01:35:58.313]  If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for their doubting too.
[01:35:59.193 --> 01:36:05.235]  If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, or being lied about, don't deal in lies.
[01:36:06.136 --> 01:36:11.938]  Or being hated, don't give way to hating, and yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise.
[01:36:13.683 --> 01:36:39.487]  If you can dream and not make dreams your master, if you can think and not make thoughts your aim, if you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two impostors just the same, if you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken, twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, and stoop and build them up with worn-out tools,
[01:36:41.593 --> 01:37:04.765]  If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it on one turn of pitch and toss And booze and start again at your beginnings And never breathe a word about your loss If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone And so hold on when there is nothing in you Except the will which says to them, hold on
[01:37:06.673 --> 01:37:12.455]  If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, or walk with kings, nor lose the common touch.
[01:37:13.175 --> 01:37:19.877]  If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, if all men count with you, but a nun too much.
[01:37:21.037 --> 01:37:29.759]  If you can fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds worth of distance run, yours is the earth and everything that's in it.
[01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:35.041]  And, which is more, you'll be a man, my son.
[01:37:40.544 --> 01:37:43.065]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas.
[01:37:44.266 --> 01:37:51.569]  It's a global corporate combine empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big mega banks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[01:37:51.609 --> 01:37:54.490]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[01:37:54.510 --> 01:37:56.271]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[01:37:56.331 --> 01:37:58.292]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[01:37:58.492 --> 01:37:59.172]  The Communist Chinese
[01:37:59.232 --> 01:37:59.432]  We're good.
[01:38:15.772 --> 01:38:20.553]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[01:38:20.853 --> 01:38:21.694]  This is happening.
[01:38:21.734 --> 01:38:29.656]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[01:38:29.736 --> 01:38:35.658]  Now, this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[01:38:35.718 --> 01:38:44.080]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion, paradigm manipulation.
[01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:48.483]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[01:38:48.543 --> 01:38:51.986]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[01:38:52.206 --> 01:38:59.352]  And now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[01:38:59.552 --> 01:39:02.214]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[01:39:02.574 --> 01:39:07.478]  Total Internet of Things, integration, global social score, complete command and control system.
[01:39:07.799 --> 01:39:09.420]  It is the virtual reality AI
[01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:16.447]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering ramming it out as much as I can.
[01:39:30.064 --> 01:39:38.794]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception, where every angle of my good is turned against it.
[01:39:38.814 --> 01:39:43.740]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:48.986]  I'm a person that cares about life and children, and is against these wars, and so they make me a herder of children.
[01:39:49.326 --> 01:39:56.988]  And then they built me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[01:39:57.208 --> 01:40:04.231]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[01:40:04.371 --> 01:40:10.052]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you.
[01:40:10.292 --> 01:40:14.754]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[01:40:14.894 --> 01:40:17.095]  I have given you the transmission!
[01:40:17.175 --> 01:40:18.115]  Now break free!
[01:40:21.887 --> 01:40:30.750]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[01:40:30.850 --> 01:40:33.650]  Thomas Jefferson.
[01:40:33.790 --> 01:40:37.872]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:41:01.075 --> 01:41:02.975]  We're back live on Erasing Your Phone Calls.
[01:41:02.995 --> 01:41:11.397]  I had Robert Barnes joining us, but I wanted to air those important clips because I put that live rant out that the great Harrison Smith added video to, but that was not even edited.
[01:41:11.417 --> 01:41:14.638]  That's one little three-minute rant I did about why they banned me.
[01:41:15.078 --> 01:41:20.799]  And now you, the listeners, have broken InfoWars out of enemy confinement.
[01:41:22.019 --> 01:41:23.880]  They were captured, but never broken, never controlled.
[01:41:24.758 --> 01:41:28.681]  But captured in their lie, captured in their narrative, we're now broken free and so are you.
[01:41:29.221 --> 01:41:29.962]  This is epic.
[01:41:29.982 --> 01:41:30.862]  This is amazing.
[01:41:31.302 --> 01:41:33.024]  This is powerful, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:33.904 --> 01:41:36.866]  And it's all unfolding right now and before your eyes.
[01:41:38.047 --> 01:41:43.130]  This is InfoWars' greatest moment today, March 11th, 2024, on this Monday.
[01:41:44.211 --> 01:41:46.052]  Marcos in Idaho, you're on the air.
[01:41:46.112 --> 01:41:46.713]  Thanks for holding.
[01:41:46.753 --> 01:41:47.173]  Go ahead.
[01:41:47.193 --> 01:41:49.895]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[01:41:50.616 --> 01:41:54.198]  I think it's, of course, time to unsheathe all of our swords.
[01:41:54.750 --> 01:41:59.151]  And use them in a Christian way in this environment because they are taking us on.
[01:41:59.311 --> 01:42:03.792]  And like they're doing to Trump, they're doing to you, they're doing to many other people.
[01:42:04.392 --> 01:42:09.534]  And just sitting back in our haunches is not going to allow things to get better.
[01:42:09.554 --> 01:42:18.176]  Well, Christ said in the Garden of Gethsemane, from my discernment, when they cut the Roman soldier's ear off and Christ put it back on, and he says to the disciple,
[01:42:19.540 --> 01:42:21.381]  Now is not the time for the sword, but it's coming.
[01:42:21.961 --> 01:42:23.662]  Sell your cloak and buy a sword.
[01:42:23.702 --> 01:42:28.625]  The cloak was a sign of your wealth, a sign of your station, a sign of your job, your profession.
[01:42:29.305 --> 01:42:30.066]  Like it is today.
[01:42:31.126 --> 01:42:35.168]  And from my perspective, it doesn't mean violence, it means your will.
[01:42:35.729 --> 01:42:40.711]  It's not what cloak you wear, it's that you have the sword of truth and your mission in your hand.
[01:42:40.731 --> 01:42:41.352]  Does that make sense?
[01:42:42.472 --> 01:42:43.233]  That's exactly it.
[01:42:44.033 --> 01:42:47.755]  The reason I'm calling today, and thank you for the chance to say this to people,
[01:42:48.514 --> 01:43:03.757]  We had a national reconciliation monument at the Arlington National Cemetery that was basically saying we're gonna honor both sides of the Civil War and say these people did something for this country and fought honorably.
[01:43:04.118 --> 01:43:05.578]  Now this was taken down.
[01:43:05.598 --> 01:43:08.579]  It was meant to end the pain and end the division.
[01:43:08.599 --> 01:43:12.139]  It was officially funded by Congress, now the Democrats are pulling it down.
[01:43:13.060 --> 01:43:14.640]  Exactly, and three presidents had
[01:43:15.918 --> 01:43:19.261]  It said this is a good statue and then everyone has laid a wreath on it.
[01:43:19.962 --> 01:43:20.923]  I think even Obama did.
[01:43:21.323 --> 01:43:24.325]  But they took it down, Lloyd Austin took it down just after Christmas.
[01:43:24.365 --> 01:43:36.536]  And I have been calling for the last three months the Congress members, Glenn Youngkin's office, the archives there, newspapers, Arlington newspapers, and I cannot find where this is.
[01:43:36.796 --> 01:43:40.699]  And the Congressman's office are saying, we have no idea where this is.
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:42.841]  And the archives won't get back to me.
[01:43:43.403 --> 01:43:48.687]  Um, something very nefarious has happened to this statue and it is all, it's a part of our heritage.
[01:43:48.787 --> 01:43:53.490]  It's like if... And again, talk about the statue again and the particular name, because I know the statue, I know the name.
[01:43:53.871 --> 01:43:55.572]  Give us the statue name, we'll pull it up right now.
[01:43:56.913 --> 01:44:00.095]  It's the Arlington National Reconciliation Monument.
[01:44:00.215 --> 01:44:00.455]  Yes.
[01:44:00.675 --> 01:44:07.440]  And if they did this to the national... And it's got the names of, it's got the numbers and names, I've seen it on the bottom, right, of the North and South Dead, right?
[01:44:09.161 --> 01:44:09.562]  Yes, it does.
[01:44:09.702 --> 01:44:12.644]  It also has beautiful depictions of, uh,
[01:44:13.423 --> 01:44:18.286]  Yeah, say it again, they're pulling it up.
[01:44:18.506 --> 01:44:22.149]  It's the Arlington Cemetery Reconciliation Monument.
[01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:30.794]  Yes, and if they did this to the Statue of Liberty and it disappeared like this and no one could find out and Congress couldn't find out, wouldn't everybody be in uproar?
[01:44:30.814 --> 01:44:38.159]  Well, look how they took Robert E. Lee's statue from Charlottesville and they secretly took it and destroyed it.
[01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:39.820]  Exactly.
[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:44.401]  And so that's what I'm worried about this statue and because no one knows where it is.
[01:44:44.761 --> 01:44:48.983]  And then the governor's office and the archives there and the... By the way, I'll pull it up.
[01:44:49.143 --> 01:44:50.323]  Say the name of the statue again.
[01:44:50.604 --> 01:44:51.604]  See Arlington Cemetery.
[01:44:51.644 --> 01:44:52.024]  There it is.
[01:44:53.425 --> 01:44:54.625]  Yeah, I've been there.
[01:44:54.685 --> 01:44:55.125]  I've seen it.
[01:44:55.145 --> 01:44:58.626]  So it shows the black people coming together with the white people.
[01:44:58.727 --> 01:44:59.547]  It shows everything.
[01:44:59.587 --> 01:45:00.807]  It shows the number of dead.
[01:45:00.867 --> 01:45:02.268]  How dare them remove that?
[01:45:03.948 --> 01:45:05.609]  The National Reconciliation Monument.
[01:45:05.689 --> 01:45:06.389]  And where is it?
[01:45:06.549 --> 01:45:08.290]  I want people to call up the governor's office.
[01:45:08.686 --> 01:45:18.254]  I want people to call up Congress and demand to know where this is, because Lloyd Austin has his fingerprints all over this, and as we know, that man cannot be trusted one iota.
[01:45:18.274 --> 01:45:19.315]  Well, they can take this down.
[01:45:19.355 --> 01:45:20.536]  They can take the American flag down.
[01:45:20.556 --> 01:45:21.536]  They admit that's what they want.
[01:45:21.596 --> 01:45:22.297]  Thank you, Marcos.
[01:45:22.337 --> 01:45:22.797]  Great points.
[01:45:23.298 --> 01:45:24.739]  Jonathan in New Jersey.
[01:45:24.779 --> 01:45:25.900]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:26.300]  Go ahead.
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:29.683]  Mr. Alex Jones, can I get a war cry, sir?
[01:45:35.099 --> 01:45:35.820]  Man, I love it.
[01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:36.721]  I love it, dude.
[01:45:36.961 --> 01:45:37.281]  I love it.
[01:45:37.301 --> 01:45:38.542]  I love you, too.
[01:45:38.902 --> 01:45:47.030]  So happy belated birthday, happy belated 50th, and let's hope that you have a next month a happy early 30th on the air.
[01:45:47.050 --> 01:45:48.251]  All right, brother.
[01:45:48.291 --> 01:45:50.172]  What's on your mind?
[01:45:50.493 --> 01:45:53.115]  Well, I have this little funny thing.
[01:45:53.135 --> 01:45:54.116]  It was with Pern Carlson.
[01:45:54.136 --> 01:45:56.418]  I was watching the interview with Dr. Keith Adlow.
[01:45:57.156 --> 01:46:11.665]  Over in the beginning, Dr. Keith Adlow confuses, in the beginning I'm pretty sure he didn't mean to do it, but he calls Tucker Hunter, and another thing which is confusing, um, is that Tucker Carlson and Hunter Biden... Is that another psychiatrist he had on that was Hunter Biden's psychiatrist?
[01:46:12.526 --> 01:46:12.926]  Yes, sir.
[01:46:13.066 --> 01:46:14.947]  Yeah, I just saw the whole interview, I saw clips.
[01:46:15.267 --> 01:46:17.469]  People get names wrong, I don't think there's anything, you know, into that.
[01:46:18.229 --> 01:46:18.910]  Yeah, nothing with that.
[01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:22.292]  And then also, Tucker Carlson and Hunter Biden were neighbors at one point.
[01:46:24.961 --> 01:46:26.622]  Yeah, I mean, that was just another thing.
[01:46:26.722 --> 01:46:28.944]  And I just have two questions for you.
[01:46:28.964 --> 01:46:31.926]  And you don't have to answer them, it has something to do with your personal life.
[01:46:31.966 --> 01:46:35.509]  So what did you say to MTG that for her not to want to talk to you anymore?
[01:46:35.529 --> 01:46:40.472]  And another question is, do you think Adrian Deadman is the Eon AI?
[01:46:42.594 --> 01:46:49.519]  Okay, I like MTG and I support her and she won't return my calls for a couple months and won't come on the show and won't say why.
[01:46:50.059 --> 01:46:51.540]  But I like MTG a lot.
[01:46:51.620 --> 01:46:53.242]  They should make a great Vice President.
[01:46:54.226 --> 01:46:55.648]  I don't know what's going on with her and I really don't care.
[01:46:55.688 --> 01:46:56.488]  It's not about gossip.
[01:46:57.089 --> 01:46:57.930]  I like her as a person.
[01:46:58.210 --> 01:47:00.112]  Getting around the show doesn't really get ratings or anything.
[01:47:00.713 --> 01:47:02.034]  I just interview, I want to interview.
[01:47:02.054 --> 01:47:03.596]  There's no beef with me and MTG.
[01:47:04.096 --> 01:47:05.798]  I just mentioned that during the Bongino thing.
[01:47:06.670 --> 01:47:08.271]  Because, you know, he won't talk to me either.
[01:47:08.831 --> 01:47:13.953]  And he basically told me, oh, I think you say I'm your source of Secret Service stuff.
[01:47:13.973 --> 01:47:16.274]  It's like, dude, you think you're a little too important, if that's the case.
[01:47:16.294 --> 01:47:18.155]  We have massive sources out there.
[01:47:18.715 --> 01:47:19.816]  Not just in the Secret Service.
[01:47:20.796 --> 01:47:21.557]  So you got that.
[01:47:21.597 --> 01:47:27.519]  But no, as for Adrian Dittman, that sounds just like Elon Musk, I don't know what's going on with that.
[01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:28.940]  Okay, so.
[01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:31.601]  I mean, that's it.
[01:47:31.621 --> 01:47:32.462]  I have nothing else to say.
[01:47:32.522 --> 01:47:33.282]  It's just a distraction.
[01:47:33.802 --> 01:47:35.363]  We got World War III stuff going on, brother.
[01:47:35.956 --> 01:47:37.157]  Tammy in Wisconsin.
[01:47:37.217 --> 01:47:38.398]  Oh, first, Matt in Kansas.
[01:47:38.438 --> 01:47:38.938]  Go ahead, Matt.
[01:47:40.540 --> 01:47:41.481]  Hey there, Alex.
[01:47:41.601 --> 01:47:42.281]  First time caller.
[01:47:42.301 --> 01:47:43.102]  Can you hear me?
[01:47:43.482 --> 01:47:43.762]  Yes, sir.
[01:47:43.782 --> 01:47:44.043]  Go ahead.
[01:47:45.324 --> 01:47:57.213]  So I just wanted to talk about the very technical ruling of the Supreme Court on Donald Trump and how they ruled that the presidential immunity, they really iterated that fact.
[01:47:57.754 --> 01:48:05.420]  So I was just talking about how Biden, you know, could use that power to then
[01:48:07.376 --> 01:48:08.657]  Well, I mean, be specific.
[01:48:08.937 --> 01:48:13.821]  Look, presidents are held accountable by the voters and by Congress with impeachment.
[01:48:13.861 --> 01:48:17.804]  But if any little prosecutor can indict him, they will.
[01:48:17.864 --> 01:48:19.465]  So that's why he has immunity from that.
[01:48:19.485 --> 01:48:20.086]  Does that make sense?
[01:48:21.146 --> 01:48:21.887]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:48:21.947 --> 01:48:27.131]  But it just seems like they're setting up Biden for that immunity to reiterate.
[01:48:28.112 --> 01:48:28.472]  No, no, no.
[01:48:28.512 --> 01:48:29.913]  I mean, I agree.
[01:48:29.993 --> 01:48:31.654]  But the immunity already existed.
[01:48:32.555 --> 01:48:35.077]  So the left spin, these are new powers.
[01:48:35.117 --> 01:48:36.358]  The president is not true.
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:38.540]  Okay.
[01:48:39.861 --> 01:48:40.702]  Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[01:48:53.740 --> 01:48:59.246]  The state and local governments because they could constantly try to pull him down and violate the voters will.
[01:48:59.907 --> 01:49:10.619]  So we draft him to go in there and the founders are like we've got to put protections in here or we'll have Fannie Willis's and Letitia James's and these people constantly doing this.
[01:49:10.679 --> 01:49:10.959]  Okay.
[01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:11.880]  Thank you, sir.
[01:49:12.864 --> 01:49:16.528]  And the Democrats have said, oh, don't worry, we're going to have immunity for Democrat presidents.
[01:49:16.568 --> 01:49:17.729]  It's already on the books.
[01:49:18.390 --> 01:49:20.072]  The courts are just ruling that he hasn't.
[01:49:20.833 --> 01:49:21.393]  It's already there.
[01:49:21.454 --> 01:49:22.335]  They didn't give him this power.
[01:49:23.035 --> 01:49:24.477]  Terry in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:49:24.497 --> 01:49:24.897]  Go ahead.
[01:49:26.479 --> 01:49:27.160]  Hey, Alex.
[01:49:28.161 --> 01:49:31.905]  Can't wait to hear you come back from break with the doors.
[01:49:32.045 --> 01:49:33.166]  You know, this is the end.
[01:49:33.587 --> 01:49:34.067]  So fitting.
[01:49:35.274 --> 01:49:41.182]  But, you know, being this far along, I think it's time that you acknowledge knowledge fight.
[01:49:41.622 --> 01:49:43.365]  I appreciate your call.
[01:49:43.505 --> 01:49:44.486]  I really appreciate your call.
[01:49:44.526 --> 01:49:44.907]  Thank you.
[01:49:44.927 --> 01:49:48.311]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Heather in Pennsylvania.
[01:49:48.351 --> 01:49:49.052]  Heather, you're on the air.
[01:49:49.112 --> 01:49:49.393]  Welcome.
[01:49:50.322 --> 01:49:52.283]  Hi Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[01:49:52.343 --> 01:49:56.964]  Hey buddy, thank you so much for what you do and thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak.
[01:49:57.704 --> 01:50:08.608]  I live in Pittsburgh and the situation here with the police, them taking them away and them getting on the air and trying to justify it and say that the data backs it up, that's an absolute lie.
[01:50:09.148 --> 01:50:15.050]  I'm a 47 year old woman and I stand downtown waiting for a city bus at 11pm every weeknight
[01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:17.492]  Alex, I've been on both sides of the law.
[01:50:17.512 --> 01:50:18.052]  I rebuilt my life.
[01:50:18.072 --> 01:50:18.893]  I was on drugs.
[01:50:18.913 --> 01:50:19.453]  I went to jail.
[01:50:19.473 --> 01:50:20.294]  I committed crimes.
[01:50:31.275 --> 01:50:38.266]  I came out for the last three years, I've spent rebuilding my life, I have a full-time job, healthcare, 401k, the works.
[01:50:38.346 --> 01:50:39.588]  I do the right thing now.
[01:50:40.029 --> 01:50:45.718]  And now the police, imagine if there's already crime at night, they're saying no police at night, what are the criminals going to do?
[01:50:46.653 --> 01:50:54.358]  It's going to be insane, Alex, and now I'm thinking about changing what I, my, you know, my stability, my job is my stability.
[01:50:54.398 --> 01:50:59.601]  It keeps me going, keeps me doing the right thing, and now I'm thinking... By the way, I'm not going to hang up on you, Heather.
[01:50:59.621 --> 01:51:00.041]  Start over.
[01:51:00.061 --> 01:51:01.882]  There's a lot of people tuning in every few minutes.
[01:51:02.503 --> 01:51:07.286]  Last hour we covered, they're getting rid of police and 9-1-1, basically.
[01:51:07.326 --> 01:51:12.029]  They won't come for most crimes, including burglaries, you name it, after midnight.
[01:51:12.049 --> 01:51:15.371]  So for people that didn't know that's happening, go ahead.
[01:51:16.664 --> 01:51:20.025]  Yeah, it's incredible that they think that that's justified.
[01:51:20.145 --> 01:51:28.328]  And now, here I am in my situation, I'm already in fear standing down there, you know, with everything that goes on.
[01:51:28.348 --> 01:51:34.091]  And if you get attacked or defend yourself... They're not coming for me!
[01:51:34.111 --> 01:51:36.091]  They'll throw the book at you.
[01:51:36.351 --> 01:51:36.712]  You know?
[01:51:36.732 --> 01:51:40.473]  So, I just wanted to get on here and say... Well, you gotta love the government.
[01:51:40.493 --> 01:51:42.914]  We're gonna take your guns and there won't be police.
[01:51:43.883 --> 01:51:48.125]  And there's nothing I can do to defend myself, you know, and what am I going to do?
[01:51:48.145 --> 01:51:51.287]  I don't know what to do to change this.
[01:51:51.867 --> 01:51:59.771]  I just wanted to get out here and say that, you know, them taking away the police force and the protections for the people who are trying to do the right thing.
[01:52:00.091 --> 01:52:06.254]  And there's a lot of us down here in Pittsburgh who have been on the wrong side of the law, who have rebuilt our lives and are doing it right now.
[01:52:06.294 --> 01:52:08.115]  You know what they're going to do when the crime explodes?
[01:52:08.135 --> 01:52:11.016]  They're going to put troops on the streets and then they won't stop the criminals.
[01:52:11.316 --> 01:52:12.817]  They'll just harass the general public.
[01:52:13.638 --> 01:52:20.140]  Yes they will, and we'll be pulled right back down into that spiral, you know, of bad things happening around us.
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:23.341]  And I just, I want to leave Pittsburgh now at this point.
[01:52:23.381 --> 01:52:24.461]  I really just want to leave the country.
[01:52:24.481 --> 01:52:26.642]  Alright, thank you so much Heather, God bless you, be safe.
[01:52:27.142 --> 01:52:29.343]  Mason in Michigan, you're on the air sir, go ahead.
[01:52:30.503 --> 01:52:31.764]  Hey Alex, can you hear me?
[01:52:31.964 --> 01:52:32.564]  I can, go ahead.
[01:52:33.844 --> 01:52:37.285]  I just wanted to plug the products that I buy quite a few times.
[01:52:37.625 --> 01:52:41.507]  The iodine and the Brain Force, Turbo Force, and the shirts.
[01:52:41.867 --> 01:52:42.627]  I like the mystery.
[01:52:43.537 --> 01:52:44.878]  Sure, that's one of my favorite things.
[01:52:45.339 --> 01:52:57.928]  But what I wanted to talk about is people, they go around and they eat this food at the grocery store and they say, well I've been eating all this stuff my whole life and I just wanted to know what you think about that.
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:07.242]  Well, I'm not perfect, and I'm super stressed out, and I don't eat a lot of fast food, but I still eat a lot of restaurant food.
[01:53:07.623 --> 01:53:13.324]  It's full of seed oils, it's full of GMOs, it's deadly as hell, and now they're making it even worse.
[01:53:13.845 --> 01:53:19.647]  And people that just say, yeah, I've done this all my whole life, yeah, and our life expectancy is dropping, our fertility is dropping, and they are hitting us through the food.
[01:53:20.047 --> 01:53:22.207]  So I would say to people, we're not judging you.
[01:53:22.828 --> 01:53:24.808]  None of us are perfect, but we should move away from this.
[01:53:25.869 --> 01:53:26.109]  Yeah.
[01:53:29.266 --> 01:53:36.295]  That's one of the things I was, it kind of gets me, you know, and all this garbage they do, like these big companies and all that.
[01:53:36.395 --> 01:53:42.523]  So, you know, just take the vaccine, eat all the GMOs and just beat, just die.
[01:53:43.184 --> 01:53:44.085]  Just enjoy it.
[01:53:44.185 --> 01:53:46.068]  It's pretty much what they want you to do, I mean.
[01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:48.041]  Anyway... Ditto.
[01:53:48.061 --> 01:53:51.364]  Hey, I'm not at home, I'm on the road, so I don't have my Lyft with me.
[01:54:13.018 --> 01:54:24.067]  But Joe Rogan, Aaron Rodgers, Ted Nugent, Ron Paul, Dave Mustaine, your friend Buzz Beavis, Alex, Harrison Owen, the list just goes on.
[01:54:26.629 --> 01:54:27.889]  No, you're right.
[01:54:28.050 --> 01:54:29.431]  All the cool people are patriots.
[01:54:29.511 --> 01:54:30.291]  I love that.
[01:54:30.692 --> 01:54:33.854]  But cooler than us is you, brother, and the general public, Gary.
[01:54:34.775 --> 01:54:36.156]  It's not just that they're patriots.
[01:54:36.596 --> 01:54:39.158]  In the Bible it says, come boldly before the throne.
[01:54:39.398 --> 01:54:42.801]  All these people can get elected to Congress and the Senate.
[01:54:43.419 --> 01:54:52.263]  I got a list of over 100 people that could be elected to the Senate, probably by a landslide, and Trump can't do anything unless he's got the majorities.
[01:54:53.243 --> 01:54:58.145]  And we could easily take the majorities if all these people would step up and come boldly before the throne.
[01:55:01.311 --> 01:55:07.573]  Yeah, I mean, running for office is good, but we need big talk show hosts and leaders to inspire others to run.
[01:55:07.593 --> 01:55:09.654]  I know Tucker, he's never going to run.
[01:55:10.554 --> 01:55:13.475]  He said unless God appeared before him and told him to run with Trump, he's not.
[01:55:14.335 --> 01:55:15.656]  And, you know, Joe will never do that.
[01:55:15.896 --> 01:55:18.157]  That's not my cup of tea being around all those lawyers and people.
[01:55:18.177 --> 01:55:20.897]  But I think we are boldly before the throne.
[01:55:21.438 --> 01:55:24.078]  Gary, we're trying to get people to run for office by inspiring them.
[01:55:24.539 --> 01:55:25.399]  But I hear what you're saying.
[01:55:25.939 --> 01:55:28.420]  It'd be a hard ticket to beat if all those people ran for office.
[01:55:29.454 --> 01:55:29.994]  Yes it would.
[01:55:30.494 --> 01:55:31.755]  We could put a hundred people in.
[01:55:31.775 --> 01:55:35.376]  I think Trump basically got in that position.
[01:55:35.396 --> 01:55:37.036]  Yeah, I think we're to the have to for everybody.
[01:55:50.848 --> 01:55:51.988]  Gary, thank you so much.
[01:55:52.128 --> 01:55:54.429]  All right, Tammy and Sue, we'll get to you.
[01:55:55.170 --> 01:55:59.971]  And we'll take a few calls for Robert Barnes, too, on legal issues for Trump and America as well.
[01:56:00.011 --> 01:56:00.692]  Robert Barnes coming up.

[01:59:52.396 --> 01:59:56.337]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:59:59.637 --> 02:00:04.223]  You heard Klausi McSchwab's first two records.
[02:00:08.508 --> 02:00:12.152]  But this one is gonna make your modified mRNA tingle.
[02:00:12.613 --> 02:00:16.137]  Time Lies presents Greatest Schwabs, Volume 15.
[02:00:16.177 --> 02:00:19.260]  A new world order in music.
[02:00:20.041 --> 02:00:22.223]  One, two, three, four, five.
[02:00:22.423 --> 02:00:24.945]  All the unvaccinated are still alive!
[02:00:25.305 --> 02:00:27.687]  A little bit of Pfizer in my arm.
[02:00:28.047 --> 02:00:30.429]  A little bit of BioNTech does no harm.
[02:00:30.809 --> 02:00:33.031]  A little Johnson & Johnson does the trick.
[02:00:33.571 --> 02:00:36.093]  A little AstraZeneca so you don't get sick.
[02:00:36.533 --> 02:00:38.215]  It's booster number five!
[02:00:39.542 --> 02:00:41.442]  Let's talk about wax, baby.
[02:00:41.782 --> 02:00:43.643]  Let's talk about Dr. Fauci.
[02:00:44.003 --> 02:00:48.104]  Let's talk about all the Viet and count the side effects, maybe.
[02:00:48.484 --> 02:00:49.964]  Let's talk about wax.
[02:00:50.724 --> 02:00:51.744]  Let's talk about wax.
[02:00:51.764 --> 02:00:54.205]  Come and take the 7th shot.
[02:00:54.325 --> 02:00:55.305]  The 7th shot.
[02:00:55.325 --> 02:00:58.866]  This a little luck you get.
[02:00:58.946 --> 02:01:03.187]  My, my, my, my, oh!
[02:01:03.247 --> 02:01:04.987]  My, my, my, my, myocarditis.
[02:01:06.482 --> 02:01:10.465]  You won't have to be rich with CBDC.
[02:01:10.745 --> 02:01:14.708]  You'll have all you need with central currency.
[02:01:15.029 --> 02:01:18.812]  We just take your extra wealth, senor.
[02:01:23.633 --> 02:01:38.577]  And you can walk 500 steps, but not a single step more until the curfew activates and robot cops vent at your door.
[02:01:39.637 --> 02:01:46.139]  Just a small town boy drinking genetically modified soy.
[02:01:46.159 --> 02:01:51.361]  This ensures he doesn't procreate.
[02:01:54.136 --> 02:01:56.598]  Please stop the bleeding.
[02:01:56.638 --> 02:01:58.080]  Stop the bleeding.
[02:01:58.300 --> 02:02:00.782]  We're almost 9 billion people.
[02:02:01.523 --> 02:02:08.850]  Please stop the bleeding right now.
[02:02:10.471 --> 02:02:12.613]  We didn't start the Pfizer.
[02:02:13.414 --> 02:02:16.677]  We just made you take it, even if you hate it.
[02:02:18.180 --> 02:02:19.941]  Greatest Schwabs, Volume 15.
[02:02:20.941 --> 02:02:24.583]  Now available on Spotify and MRN Apple Music.
[02:02:27.004 --> 02:02:31.405]  Oh, the caterpillar tastes like chicken being vined.
[02:02:32.066 --> 02:02:35.047]  And mealworm tastes just like a steak.
[02:02:35.067 --> 02:02:41.209]  Ain't nothing better than a deep fried butterfly.
[02:02:41.870 --> 02:02:44.711]  Or centipede protein shake.
[02:02:46.653 --> 02:02:50.896]  Be sure to check the Cricket Mag Nuggets out.
[02:02:51.516 --> 02:02:54.658]  They're almost as crunchy as worms.
[02:02:56.499 --> 02:03:00.722]  And chew your cricket hotbar sandwich extra loud.
[02:03:01.342 --> 02:03:04.144]  Cause this is all you get.
[02:03:05.145 --> 02:03:07.907]  I don't care who you are.
[02:03:08.667 --> 02:03:10.128]  Where you're from.
[02:03:10.508 --> 02:03:12.690]  Don't care what you want.
[02:03:13.250 --> 02:03:15.291]  You will eat a bug.
[02:03:21.407 --> 02:03:27.455]  For some people, the ultimate goal in life has been becoming the President of the United States.
[02:03:27.655 --> 02:03:30.018]  Would you like to be the President of the United States?
[02:03:30.258 --> 02:03:37.027]  I really don't believe I would, but I would like to see somebody as the President who could do the job, and there are very capable people in this country.
[02:03:37.509 --> 02:03:39.830]  Most people who are capable are not running for office.
[02:03:39.990 --> 02:03:42.110]  Most men are frightened of politics today.
[02:03:42.230 --> 02:03:43.190]  It is a shame, isn't it?
[02:03:43.351 --> 02:03:43.551]  Yes.
[02:03:43.691 --> 02:03:44.271]  It is a shame.
[02:03:44.691 --> 02:03:49.432]  The most capable people are not necessarily running for political office.
[02:03:49.572 --> 02:03:51.733]  And that is a very sad commentary on the country.
[02:03:52.373 --> 02:03:56.774]  They had major corporations and they had this and that, but they are not running for political office.
[02:03:57.094 --> 02:03:59.595]  Why wouldn't someone like yourself run for political office?
[02:03:59.635 --> 02:04:01.915]  You have all the money that you possibly need.
[02:04:01.975 --> 02:04:04.396]  You've accomplished a great deal, even though you are only 34.
[02:04:05.796 --> 02:04:08.837]  I know there's a lot of things that you possibly can do in the years ahead.
[02:04:09.277 --> 02:04:11.838]  Why wouldn't you dedicate yourself to public service?
[02:04:12.078 --> 02:04:13.698]  Because I think it's a very mean life.
[02:04:14.458 --> 02:04:19.099]  I would love and I would dedicate my life to this country, but I see it as being a mean life.
[02:04:19.179 --> 02:04:21.720]  And I also see it as somebody with strong views.
[02:04:22.614 --> 02:04:34.299]  And somebody with the kind of views that are maybe a little bit unpopular, which may be right, but may be unpopular, wouldn't necessarily have a chance of getting elected against somebody with no great brain but a big smile.
[02:04:35.100 --> 02:04:37.421]  And that's a sad commentary for the political process.
[02:04:38.121 --> 02:04:40.982]  Television, in a strange way, has ruined that process, hasn't it?
[02:04:41.163 --> 02:04:42.483]  It's hurt the process very much.
[02:04:42.523 --> 02:04:44.044]  I mean, the Abraham Lincolns of the world.
[02:04:44.164 --> 02:04:48.346]  Abraham Lincoln would probably not be electable today because of television.
[02:04:48.406 --> 02:04:50.667]  He was not a handsome man and he did not smile.
[02:04:53.624 --> 02:04:54.805]  Bob Barnes coming up.
[02:05:04.991 --> 02:05:05.972]  Please support us.

[02:05:17.419 --> 02:05:19.121]  Get Next Level Foundational Energy.
[02:05:19.161 --> 02:05:21.122]  They're all incredible products.
[02:05:22.523 --> 02:05:25.625]  Next Level Foundational Energy is about to sell out, but it's not a stimulant.
[02:05:25.685 --> 02:05:27.066]  No, it's the energy of the cells.
[02:05:27.127 --> 02:05:27.987]  Different level energy.
[02:05:28.307 --> 02:05:29.148]  That's why it's Next Level.
[02:05:29.528 --> 02:05:31.390]  That's why TurboForce is 10-hour clean energy.
[02:05:31.450 --> 02:05:34.272]  It is a bunch of stimulants that are natural and good, with a good letdown.
[02:05:34.993 --> 02:05:35.433]  Amazing.
[02:05:35.773 --> 02:05:36.654]  TurboForce.
[02:05:36.674 --> 02:05:37.755]  Next Level Foundational Energy.
[02:05:38.535 --> 02:05:39.396]  You clean out your blood.
[02:05:39.576 --> 02:05:41.598]  Everybody should be on now.
[02:05:43.219 --> 02:05:43.999]  Nitric Boost.
[02:05:44.380 --> 02:05:46.922]  InfoWarStore.com.
[02:05:47.062 --> 02:05:47.762]  Nitric Boost.
[02:05:48.443 --> 02:05:49.384]  We're funded by the people.
[02:05:49.504 --> 02:05:50.204]  Thanks for your support.
[02:05:50.484 --> 02:05:50.965]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:53.661 --> 02:06:09.151]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:10.452 --> 02:06:15.936]  Alright, one of the smartest people I know is Robert Barnes.
[02:06:18.017 --> 02:06:20.419]  And he is kicking some major ass.
[02:06:22.912 --> 02:06:23.873]  Here's a little side point.
[02:06:24.753 --> 02:06:27.775]  He came in here four years ago and did an audit of the operation.
[02:06:29.516 --> 02:06:33.778]  And he said, you have overpaid taxes the last five years, probably $7 million.
[02:06:34.418 --> 02:06:38.821]  But he said with the taxes, this is attorney-client privilege, but who cares, it's out there, probably $4.5.
[02:06:39.241 --> 02:06:43.303]  They then audited us.
[02:06:43.663 --> 02:06:44.904]  I didn't listen to Barnes.
[02:06:45.024 --> 02:06:46.024]  I didn't go to a clawback.
[02:06:46.665 --> 02:06:49.086]  They audited us a year and a half ago with the Justice Department.
[02:06:49.106 --> 02:06:50.007]  Then they put us in jail.
[02:06:50.447 --> 02:06:52.248]  And the IRS came back six months ago and said,
[02:06:53.956 --> 02:06:57.499]  We don't usually do this, it's very rare, but you're owed $4.2 million.
[02:06:58.260 --> 02:07:00.261]  Which sounds like a lot, but with our bills and everything, it's nothing.
[02:07:00.281 --> 02:07:02.803]  And it went right into bankruptcy, and right into that.
[02:07:04.364 --> 02:07:10.930]  But the point is, Barnes nailed it four years ago, and said, you've overpaid your taxes.
[02:07:11.110 --> 02:07:18.156]  He runs a tax company, he's got big tax lawyers, he did it for free, he just looked at our stuff, and he was totally right.
[02:07:18.196 --> 02:07:22.279]  It wasn't that I thought it was wrong, my CPAs are like, don't do that, don't claw money back.
[02:07:22.599 --> 02:07:23.180]  But it was true.
[02:07:24.008 --> 02:07:25.469]  But we didn't go try to get it.
[02:07:25.689 --> 02:07:29.910]  They audited us and then certified it was accurate.
[02:07:30.151 --> 02:07:37.694]  That's a little side issue, Barnes, but you've been inside this operation of the enemies of the globalistic and we're like some Lex Luthor operation.
[02:07:37.714 --> 02:07:40.855]  I want to get into Trump and all the big news there, but first, you know me well.
[02:07:41.715 --> 02:07:43.076]  They don't, this is like Mayberry.
[02:07:43.476 --> 02:07:44.838]  And I'm proud to be like Mayberry.
[02:07:44.918 --> 02:07:47.262]  I mean, I'm like completely a straight shooter.
[02:07:47.722 --> 02:07:49.365]  In fact, I don't even know how to BS people.
[02:07:49.725 --> 02:07:51.188]  That's our superpower.
[02:07:51.208 --> 02:07:52.650]  But what do you make of that development?
[02:07:52.670 --> 02:07:53.491]  We haven't talked about that.
[02:07:53.591 --> 02:07:55.154]  I've never even called and thanked you.
[02:07:55.354 --> 02:07:56.315]  We talk on air once a month.
[02:07:56.355 --> 02:07:57.377]  I didn't even tell you about that.
[02:07:57.397 --> 02:07:58.699]  I didn't even tell you that happened.
[02:07:58.719 --> 02:07:59.220]  What do you make of that?
[02:08:00.587 --> 02:08:01.469]  Oh, that's fantastic.
[02:08:01.549 --> 02:08:02.591]  I mean, that's absolutely true.
[02:08:02.611 --> 02:08:13.410]  I remember, you know, years ago after I first started working and, you know, getting the chance to know you and there's people that are like, well, what's the deep, dark secret of Alex Jones?
[02:08:15.263 --> 02:08:16.063]  Well, what have you seen?
[02:08:16.103 --> 02:08:21.966]  Because you've got all these Homeland versions and caricatures and conspiracy theories about Alex Jones out there.
[02:08:22.346 --> 02:08:28.128]  And I'm like, you know, the great, dark, deep secret of Alex Jones is that he loves to barbecue.
[02:08:28.409 --> 02:08:30.169]  He loves to go out and swim in the morning.
[02:08:30.209 --> 02:08:31.590]  He likes to be out in nature.
[02:08:31.650 --> 02:08:33.211]  He likes American cars.
[02:08:33.251 --> 02:08:34.571]  He likes American food.
[02:08:34.811 --> 02:08:36.032]  He likes American women.
[02:08:36.372 --> 02:08:37.593]  He likes fireworks.
[02:08:38.293 --> 02:08:39.634]  He likes barbecues.
[02:08:40.734 --> 02:08:42.755]  He's as American as American gets.
[02:08:43.756 --> 02:08:47.598]  That's the real dark secret of Alex Jones.
[02:08:47.678 --> 02:08:54.942]  People imagine all these ridiculous, preposterous, and ludicrous things about you that are nowhere close to reality.
[02:08:55.402 --> 02:09:00.145]  It's crazy that I asked your firm to do an assessment of my taxes to make sure I paid them.
[02:09:00.745 --> 02:09:04.708]  You came back and you said maximum $7 million, minimum $4 million, you should claw this back.
[02:09:05.288 --> 02:09:06.049]  I didn't do it.
[02:09:06.209 --> 02:09:10.072]  And then four years later, they audit me and do exactly what you said.
[02:09:10.092 --> 02:09:12.774]  So you've got a really good, you never talk about your tax stuff.
[02:09:12.794 --> 02:09:18.378]  You represented, you know, a lot of famous people, billionaires, a lot of famous Hollywood people.
[02:09:18.398 --> 02:09:21.400]  I mean, damn, you nailed it, though.
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:23.762]  You guys talk about you never plug yourself.
[02:09:24.082 --> 02:09:26.604]  Talk about what you do as a tax lawyer, because nobody knows you do that.
[02:09:26.624 --> 02:09:27.345]  You're a big tax lawyer.
[02:09:29.406 --> 02:09:30.948]  Yeah, well, my dad was a tax accountant.
[02:09:31.268 --> 02:09:32.889]  My mom did a tax accounting.
[02:09:33.310 --> 02:09:35.432]  So it was the first kind of work that we do.
[02:09:35.572 --> 02:09:44.501]  And it's because it's the main area where the ordinary individual intersects and interacts with the state, where the state is trying to take something that often doesn't belong to the state.
[02:09:45.061 --> 02:09:58.233]  And that our tax laws are written with all kinds of loopholes in them, but once you understand how they really function in the broader public policy they're serving, there's ways that almost everybody out there can save money in one way, shape, or form.
[02:09:58.553 --> 02:10:02.217]  Last week I had a client being audited by the California Franchise Tax Board.
[02:10:02.537 --> 02:10:04.198]  They wanted $1.2 million.
[02:10:04.539 --> 02:10:05.720]  He was willing to settle for $450,000.
[02:10:09.583 --> 02:10:18.811]  Once we were done, the California Franchise Tax Board wrote him an apology for auditing him and said no change and actually wrote a $450,000 check to him.
[02:10:19.811 --> 02:10:21.413]  So there's ways in which you can do that.
[02:10:21.933 --> 02:10:31.321]  These agencies seem scary and frightening because they deliberately try to do that to people, terrify people from asserting their rights and exercising their liberties and protecting themselves.
[02:10:31.981 --> 02:10:33.882]  But there's all kinds of ways to do that.
[02:10:33.962 --> 02:10:45.426]  Every tax client I've ever had has saved money by having us as their legal team, because we ultimately save more money in the tax than it ever costs for us to represent them.
[02:10:45.667 --> 02:10:49.848]  Well, I brought this to major CPA firms when I asked you to do it, because I thought I might have liabilities.
[02:10:50.288 --> 02:10:51.489]  You said no, actually, you're owed money.
[02:10:52.677 --> 02:10:58.224]  And then, we know the deep state's bad, but it's also very automated, and there's also a lot of people in the government that are sick of the tyranny.
[02:10:59.245 --> 02:11:01.588]  Why do you think the IRS audited us and did the right thing?
[02:11:01.608 --> 02:11:02.550]  I guess because it's automated?
[02:11:04.309 --> 02:11:05.269]  Increasingly it is.
[02:11:05.470 --> 02:11:11.552]  That's both to the credit and to some degree that there's some risk with it, but Peter Thiel.
[02:11:11.632 --> 02:11:14.353]  Peter Thiel introduced the Palantir technology.
[02:11:14.753 --> 02:11:17.134]  The IRS now increasingly relies upon it.
[02:11:17.754 --> 02:11:30.900]  I've often said, I think you would probably concur with this, you know, when it comes to AI, there's a lot of reasons to worry about it, but if I had a choice between AI as replacing our judges and our judicial system, I would choose AI.
[02:11:31.240 --> 02:11:33.081]  Because at least they have some objective rules.
[02:11:33.101 --> 02:11:34.121]  If it was honestly proven
[02:11:35.582 --> 02:11:37.182]  Exactly, exactly, exactly.
[02:11:52.270 --> 02:11:52.750]  Exactly.
[02:11:52.910 --> 02:12:00.172]  I mean, Grok has very favorable things to say about a range of populist figures out there.
[02:12:00.232 --> 02:12:03.092]  So, at least then you have objective metric.
[02:12:03.252 --> 02:12:06.253]  Also, if you know how the system works, the IRS doesn't like to lose.
[02:12:06.693 --> 02:12:09.734]  And if you're good at beating the IRS, then you can get them to settle.
[02:12:09.754 --> 02:12:13.915]  Yeah, but when have you heard of them auditing you and they go, sorry, you're owed money?
[02:12:14.355 --> 02:12:15.215]  How rare is that?
[02:12:16.069 --> 02:12:17.050]  Very rare, very rare.
[02:12:17.570 --> 02:12:21.792]  And it's only when it's apparent and obvious under their own rules.
[02:12:21.812 --> 02:12:25.454]  Well, my lawyers finally did when they looked at it, they actually wrote way more.
[02:12:27.196 --> 02:12:28.676]  Oh, I have no doubt about that.
[02:12:32.097 --> 02:12:40.059]  Most people that have a lot of resources pay very little in tax because they know how the system works and they have the tax lawyers and accountants.
[02:12:40.199 --> 02:12:40.739]  Remember Trump?
[02:12:40.779 --> 02:12:42.019]  I mean, Trump bragged about this.
[02:12:42.559 --> 02:12:50.821]  And despite the Feds trying to go after him, the states trying to go after him, they all came back and said they couldn't touch him on taxes, even though there were years he paid zero tax.
[02:12:51.661 --> 02:12:53.042]  Uh, even though he's a billionaire.
[02:13:21.342 --> 02:13:23.808]  By the way, thanks for, you know, it was just crazy.
[02:13:23.828 --> 02:13:28.439]  And then the plaintiff's lawyers, when we told them about this, thought we made it up.
[02:13:31.195 --> 02:13:31.956]  Yeah.
[02:13:32.076 --> 02:13:36.419]  Well, they always had this imaginary caricatured version of who you are.
[02:13:36.799 --> 02:13:38.680]  You know, the whole Homeland version of it.
[02:13:41.282 --> 02:13:46.826]  Particularly, the idea that you don't sincerely and authentically believe everything you've ever said.
[02:13:47.066 --> 02:13:49.568]  Even things that you might have got right, things you might have got wrong.
[02:13:50.168 --> 02:13:53.471]  You always authentically and sincerely believe those things.
[02:13:53.671 --> 02:13:55.312]  Anybody who knows you knows that.
[02:13:55.952 --> 02:14:01.416]  Uh, but they live in a delusional world, a fanatical, fantastical world about who you are.
[02:14:01.576 --> 02:14:13.263]  Well, that's because they're involved with the CIA and Soros, where it all is, like, when I get off work, I'm pointed at a pool table, or a pool, or at a steakhouse with my family, or at a sunset.
[02:14:13.504 --> 02:14:14.424]  I'm not scheming.
[02:14:15.245 --> 02:14:16.365]  I'm pointed at enjoyment.
[02:14:16.405 --> 02:14:17.786]  Like, when we've hung out, it's been great.
[02:14:18.927 --> 02:14:19.908]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:14:20.168 --> 02:14:24.771]  I call it, whatever they call you when it's crazy, it's confession through projection.
[02:14:25.208 --> 02:14:29.370]  So like think about all the things they've called Trump over the past six years.
[02:14:29.550 --> 02:14:31.151]  It's all stuff Joe Biden was guilty of.
[02:14:31.551 --> 02:14:38.995]  You know, said that there was corruption involving foreign entities, corruption involving the family, sexual aggression, allegations, all these things.
[02:14:39.235 --> 02:14:39.976]  It's Joe Biden.
[02:14:40.396 --> 02:14:43.698]  Joe Biden is the guy who's guilty of improper sexual conduct.
[02:14:43.898 --> 02:14:51.484]  Joe Biden is the one that's guilty of using his family to bribe foreign entities for his self-enrichment at the expense of the country.
[02:14:51.764 --> 02:14:58.668]  It was Joe Biden busy planning to be a tyrannical dictator who was going to start World War III and bankrupt the economy.
[02:14:58.969 --> 02:15:03.972]  All the things they accused Trump of and said Trump was going to do, they're guilty of.
[02:15:04.372 --> 02:15:10.458]  And so when you hear these crazy claims about Alex Jones, nine times out of ten they're describing who they are.
[02:15:10.818 --> 02:15:20.548]  Whether it's Bill Gates, whether it's George Soros, whether it's the crazy plaintiff's lawyers, whether it's the corrupt courts, they're talking about themselves.
[02:15:21.605 --> 02:15:25.647]  Enough about me, but it's just emblematic of how dead on you were and it's crazy.
[02:15:25.667 --> 02:15:28.448]  I talked to you before you came on.
[02:15:28.708 --> 02:15:29.669]  I said, what do you want to add?
[02:15:30.209 --> 02:15:35.411]  You know, the persecution of Trump, you know, the election, the martial law in New York.
[02:15:35.871 --> 02:15:38.432]  You said, no, let's talk about Trump's problems.
[02:15:38.993 --> 02:15:40.954]  Not because we don't support Trump, because we do.
[02:15:40.974 --> 02:15:41.934]  We wanted to be stronger.
[02:15:41.954 --> 02:15:44.515]  And he's really smart, but all of us have blind spots.
[02:15:45.516 --> 02:15:50.498]  And so lay out some of your issues with Trump right now, because we're not in a cult, folks.
[02:15:51.258 --> 02:15:56.119]  He's our representative, we love him, but we are then telling him what we want.
[02:15:56.519 --> 02:15:57.119]  That's good.
[02:15:57.640 --> 02:16:00.600]  I know when I put out some viral posts, I've got like 50 million views now.
[02:16:01.481 --> 02:16:03.581]  Ours are like 5 million, but reposts, 50 million.
[02:16:03.801 --> 02:16:04.761]  I don't have time to count it.
[02:16:05.021 --> 02:16:14.844]  I saw 50 million views on my videos and a few tweets in the last week saying, dude, don't tell us the COVID shot cures cancer, and don't say it saved us from COVID.
[02:16:15.504 --> 02:16:17.285]  It's one thing if you got roped into it and lied to.
[02:16:17.305 --> 02:16:18.065]  We know how that happened.
[02:16:18.085 --> 02:16:19.846]  I'm not giving Trump a getaway.
[02:16:19.966 --> 02:16:21.407]  I know he got manipulated.
[02:16:21.467 --> 02:16:21.987]  I get that.
[02:16:22.227 --> 02:16:24.168]  He also pushed everything else he thought was a cure.
[02:16:24.769 --> 02:16:25.489]  He's an optimist.
[02:16:25.749 --> 02:16:26.610]  But just stop it.
[02:16:27.110 --> 02:16:28.871]  I've had the campaign call me.
[02:16:28.931 --> 02:16:29.851]  High-level campaign.
[02:16:29.871 --> 02:16:30.572]  I'm gonna leave it at that.
[02:16:31.432 --> 02:16:32.133]  Hey, what do you want?
[02:16:32.173 --> 02:16:32.814]  What's wrong?
[02:16:32.834 --> 02:16:33.654]  I'm like, what's wrong?
[02:16:33.694 --> 02:16:34.515]  Just stop it.
[02:16:34.555 --> 02:16:35.116]  It's not good.
[02:16:35.556 --> 02:16:38.078]  Just politically, it's not good, much less it's a moral issue.
[02:16:38.639 --> 02:16:40.601]  We'll hit that in a minute, but there's other issues.
[02:16:40.981 --> 02:16:42.482]  Louie's talking about his VP.
[02:16:42.843 --> 02:16:44.564]  There's even talk about Pompeo back in.
[02:16:44.604 --> 02:16:46.926]  We don't want to repeat what happened in 2016, do we?
[02:16:48.775 --> 02:16:49.355]  No, not at all.
[02:16:49.615 --> 02:17:12.900]  And the great risk is, now that Trump is through the primaries, now that Trump is going to be on the ballots, thanks to the Supreme Court's good ruling, now that Trump has a chance to completely exit all the criminal cases due to the immunity case now before the Supreme Court, he can see the path to getting into the presidency as he leads in the polls by overwhelming margins.
[02:17:13.620 --> 02:17:17.101]  And the concern amongst people, even within the Trump camp,
[02:17:17.742 --> 02:17:25.566]  Is that he's taking that as a reason to revert back to 2020 Trump and not 2024 Trump.
[02:17:26.266 --> 02:17:30.688]  And that includes, he's looking at Tim Scott as his vice president.
[02:17:31.554 --> 02:17:40.081]  Uh, which would be a complete disaster and frankly would would take away his life insurance, uh, if he actually tried to challenge the deep state once he got into power.
[02:17:40.582 --> 02:17:48.468]  Uh, Tim Scott is a worse version of Mike Pence and we told him back in 2016 that Pence was a risk and that proved true in 2020.
[02:17:49.649 --> 02:17:55.035]  The second thing is he's AWOL on a lot of key issues he needs to no longer be AWOL on.
[02:17:55.055 --> 02:17:58.499]  Let's get to those in a moment, and I'll shut up, but let's talk about Tim Scott.
[02:17:58.599 --> 02:18:01.182]  Notice Trump said, wow, Tim Scott had no energy running.
[02:18:01.843 --> 02:18:06.848]  Now he's super energetic because his real job was to be in the running to be the VP.
[02:18:07.248 --> 02:18:11.193]  Now he's been given the order, it's so obvious, get on Trump's good side.
[02:18:12.657 --> 02:18:13.157]  Exactly.
[02:18:13.538 --> 02:18:16.960]  I mean, Tim Scott is a deep, deep state politician.
[02:18:17.481 --> 02:18:21.323]  He's not only from the deep state's favorite state, which is South Carolina.
[02:18:21.664 --> 02:18:23.225]  That's where Lindsey Graham is from.
[02:18:23.285 --> 02:18:24.786]  That's where Nikki Haley is from.
[02:18:25.365 --> 02:18:27.105]  So that's Tim Scott's background.
[02:18:27.265 --> 02:18:32.327]  Tim Scott is a deep, deep state guy, even more so than Mike Pence was.
[02:18:32.387 --> 02:18:36.648]  He's unreliable on every populist issue of any meaningful consequence.
[02:18:37.068 --> 02:18:40.109]  He does not have any political appeal within the black community.
[02:18:40.489 --> 02:18:44.410]  In South Carolina, he's never made any inroads into the... I mean, let's just say it.
[02:18:45.090 --> 02:18:47.110]  Nothing against guys that aren't married.
[02:18:47.490 --> 02:18:49.611]  Black folks don't trust somebody that doesn't like the ladies.
[02:18:51.469 --> 02:18:51.870]  No doubt.
[02:18:51.990 --> 02:18:57.035]  And he comes across as, he doesn't come across like Ben Carson does.
[02:18:57.295 --> 02:19:00.258]  I think Trump could totally trust Ben Carson.
[02:19:00.518 --> 02:19:02.320]  So let me ask you that question before we get back to Tim Scott.
[02:19:02.660 --> 02:19:03.801]  Who should Trump go with?
[02:19:03.901 --> 02:19:06.804]  I think Ben Carson, my gut tells me everything, is totally real.
[02:19:06.824 --> 02:19:10.468]  A surgeon, never wanted this, would actually, what do you think of Ben Carson?
[02:19:11.550 --> 02:19:13.493]  I think Ben Carson would be an excellent choice.
[02:19:13.793 --> 02:19:16.417]  He's someone that has already gone through national campaigns.
[02:19:16.798 --> 02:19:21.024]  He was loyal to Trump, unlike almost everyone else during his cabinet stay, tenure.
[02:19:21.044 --> 02:19:23.828]  And he's got incredible nerves of a top brain surgeon.
[02:19:23.968 --> 02:19:25.110]  You can't rile him up.
[02:19:26.204 --> 02:19:26.784]  Absolutely.
[02:19:27.365 --> 02:19:28.706]  And he's someone that has a long history.
[02:19:28.806 --> 02:19:36.190]  The black community, if Trump's goal is to try to get more black votes, Ben Carson is someone they recognize as an old school black doctor.
[02:19:36.610 --> 02:19:40.532]  Whereas Tim Scott is someone they've never recognized, never connected to.
[02:19:41.013 --> 02:19:43.114]  So if that's the goal, then Ben Carson is much better.
[02:19:43.134 --> 02:19:46.836]  Nothing against Chick-fil-A, but we will take a black brain surgeon over a black Chick-fil-A owner.
[02:19:48.107 --> 02:19:49.268]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:19:49.588 --> 02:19:56.030]  And if he wants to focus on that angle, Byron Donalds is an excellent congressman and would make an excellent VP.
[02:19:56.331 --> 02:20:02.753]  Mark Robinson, the Republican gubernatorial candidate in North Carolina, would make a much better candidate.
[02:20:03.153 --> 02:20:10.116]  I mean, Tim Scott, first of all, he's got to have somebody that the deep state is scared, as scared of them as they are of him.
[02:20:10.517 --> 02:20:11.317]  Otherwise, they'll just
[02:20:12.059 --> 02:20:17.391]  So what do you make of MTG, Vivek Ramaswamy, Tulsi Gabbards?
[02:20:17.431 --> 02:20:18.814]  I've heard they're in the discussion.
[02:20:18.834 --> 02:20:19.856]  What do you think of them?
[02:20:20.822 --> 02:20:22.363]  I mean, I think Tulsi would be excellent.
[02:20:22.864 --> 02:20:28.448]  I think Vivek is a little bit young for it, but he definitely proffers some potential.
[02:20:29.408 --> 02:20:32.851]  And I think that, you know, I still like Terry Lake.
[02:20:32.931 --> 02:20:33.811]  I still like J.D.
[02:20:33.872 --> 02:20:34.232]  Vance.
[02:20:34.472 --> 02:20:35.833]  I think both of those would be excellent.
[02:20:36.333 --> 02:20:37.454]  I really like Matt Gaetz.
[02:20:37.894 --> 02:20:39.335]  Those would all be excellent choices.
[02:20:39.756 --> 02:20:42.218]  Anybody, frankly, but the Tim Scotts of the world.
[02:20:42.538 --> 02:20:44.900]  Anybody that's hardcore and has been through the fire.
[02:20:45.220 --> 02:20:46.781]  All right, back to Trump.
[02:20:46.801 --> 02:20:47.782]  Let's talk about the shot.
[02:20:48.755 --> 02:20:56.439]  Trump's tweet about, oh yeah, during the State of the Union, oh Biden, you claim credit, no, the shot's mine and it can cure cancer, that really turned people off.
[02:20:58.260 --> 02:20:58.481]  Really?
[02:20:58.581 --> 02:21:09.227]  I mean, well, you know, we've been talking about for years that there's an out for Trump that doesn't require him to confess responsibility or accountability or any of that, things that Trump's never going to do anyway.
[02:21:09.247 --> 02:21:14.910]  Yeah, we've been trying to give him an out, and when I had Roger talk to him repeatedly and others, Trump just says, I don't want to hear about this ever again.
[02:21:16.520 --> 02:21:17.501]  Exactly.
[02:21:17.541 --> 02:21:23.907]  His ego is so invested that he, frankly, the only way we're going to get his attention is we kind of have to smack him in the face.
[02:21:23.967 --> 02:21:25.308]  That's the way Trump is now.
[02:21:25.748 --> 02:21:30.492]  And I think the most effective tool to do that is twofold.
[02:21:30.833 --> 02:21:32.274]  One is the Brooke Jackson case.
[02:21:33.034 --> 02:21:42.719]  And the, uh, which gives him a narrative that, you know, you designed a beautiful, great contract that required the delivery of a safe, effective vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19.
[02:21:43.060 --> 02:21:44.741]  That's what Pfizer promised to deliver.
[02:21:44.981 --> 02:21:51.664]  What they delivered was dangerous, ineffective, not a vaccine, and didn't inoculate or prevent transmission or infection of COVID-19.
[02:21:52.165 --> 02:21:56.047]  And then he'd be telling the truth, and he'd be a hero, and we'd go over the deep state.
[02:21:56.447 --> 02:21:58.548]  Instead, he, he doesn't understand.
[02:21:58.588 --> 02:21:59.629]  They're letting it all come out.
[02:21:59.669 --> 02:22:00.869]  They're gonna hang it around his neck.
[02:22:00.929 --> 02:22:01.890]  I've been saying that for three years.
[02:22:03.067 --> 02:22:03.708]  Absolutely.
[02:22:04.088 --> 02:22:10.173]  And the second, I think, probably the best way to motivate him right now is Robert Kennedy's campaign.
[02:22:10.473 --> 02:22:12.835]  That, you know, Trump feeds on competition.
[02:22:13.456 --> 02:22:18.020]  And if I was in the, you know, for those people that are in close to Trump at the moment,
[02:22:18.680 --> 02:22:21.001]  Uh, you know, the pitch I've been telling them is simple.
[02:22:21.261 --> 02:22:22.982]  Look, Robert Kennedy could catch fire.
[02:22:23.382 --> 02:22:30.564]  The best way to prevent Kennedy from costing Trump the election is for Trump to reach out to those Kennedy voters.
[02:22:31.065 --> 02:22:34.386]  And the number one issue for those Kennedy voters is the vaccine-related issues.
[02:22:34.906 --> 02:22:37.267]  So, you know, see, don't let Kennedy have a monopoly.
[02:22:37.287 --> 02:22:38.787]  And all he does is tell the truth.
[02:22:38.927 --> 02:22:40.028]  They told me it would work.
[02:22:40.548 --> 02:22:43.389]  I signed it over to them, but we need an investigation when I get elected.
[02:22:44.426 --> 02:22:53.950]  And this is the same Pfizer and Moderna that sandbagged him because they had it available weeks before election day and they deliberately withheld it to screw him for the election.
[02:22:54.290 --> 02:22:56.131]  So he owes them nothing but payback.
[02:22:56.531 --> 02:22:59.872]  Does Trump not know how big a detriment this is?
[02:22:59.892 --> 02:23:01.833]  This is the biggest thing pissing people off.
[02:23:02.493 --> 02:23:09.936]  I mean, just from a political thing, not even a moral perspective, which is my issue, from a perspective of politics, this is a winner to come out against him.
[02:23:10.959 --> 02:23:19.603]  I get feedback, you know, there's occasionally the core Trump support people will say, you know, don't question him, don't do this, and this is okay, and excuse it.
[02:23:19.903 --> 02:23:20.843]  Like, you don't understand.
[02:23:21.063 --> 02:23:33.609]  There's millions and millions of people in America, millions and millions of voters, who either they themselves, or they know someone close to them, who has been discriminated against, who is disabled, or is dead because of this vaccine.
[02:23:33.949 --> 02:23:42.258]  This is a radioactive third rail that Donald Trump keeps blowing up his own campaign by refusing to come to terms with this issue.
[02:23:42.598 --> 02:23:47.844]  So anybody who supports Trump, anybody who cares about Trump, has got to straighten him out.
[02:23:47.864 --> 02:23:51.928]  Well, Barnes, I just said something last week off the cuff and it got, you know, 50 million views.
[02:23:52.228 --> 02:23:54.671]  If I wanted to go full-time against Trump, I'd be much bigger doing it.
[02:23:54.711 --> 02:23:55.232]  I'm kind of like,
[02:23:55.652 --> 02:23:58.453]  I'm not a sellout, but I'm kind of holding back, wanting to do the right thing.
[02:23:59.034 --> 02:24:01.475]  But I'm not doing it for clicks, I'm doing it because it's the right thing.
[02:24:01.515 --> 02:24:04.816]  We could really hurt him right now, and the left knows that.
[02:24:04.836 --> 02:24:05.837]  They're going to use it against him.
[02:24:06.157 --> 02:24:09.798]  Because the left will ignore Biden and Schwab and Gates.
[02:24:09.818 --> 02:24:11.659]  They will destroy Trump with this.
[02:24:13.160 --> 02:24:18.903]  Especially as the number of people who know... This issue is going to be more and more and more important the closer we get to Election Day.
[02:24:19.303 --> 02:24:24.185]  Because of the number of people who know somebody directly negatively impacted by this.
[02:24:24.947 --> 02:24:27.570]  And Robert Kennedy's campaign is going to surge.
[02:24:28.090 --> 02:24:31.553]  And what I've told people is, I love Robert Kennedy.
[02:24:31.653 --> 02:24:32.374]  Great person.
[02:24:32.594 --> 02:24:33.695]  One of the best human beings.
[02:24:33.775 --> 02:24:35.456]  I had dinner with him on Friday.
[02:24:36.778 --> 02:24:41.682]  But realistically, Trump is the best chance for populism for 2024.
[02:24:42.042 --> 02:24:47.067]  But it's only going to work as a president if he fixes these kind of issues.
[02:24:47.407 --> 02:24:49.349]  He can't be AWOL on the vaccine.
[02:24:49.469 --> 02:24:50.630]  And he already said this.
[02:24:50.670 --> 02:24:51.531]  He already said this.
[02:24:52.151 --> 02:24:57.262]  Seven, eight years ago, he said, I'm going to put Kennedy as a vaccine czar, pledge to do it and do it.
[02:24:57.382 --> 02:24:59.567]  And then say, I don't know what's going on with this.
[02:24:59.607 --> 02:25:00.288]  They may lie to me.
[02:25:00.308 --> 02:25:00.869]  I'm not sure.
[02:25:01.370 --> 02:25:02.833]  Robert F. Kennedy will be my vaccine czar.
[02:25:03.959 --> 02:25:04.419]  Exactly.
[02:25:04.619 --> 02:25:05.360]  It's a no-brainer.
[02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:06.641]  It's an easy thing to do.
[02:25:07.101 --> 02:25:11.744]  It's like the Amos Miller case, or the Brooke Jackson case, or Julian Assange, or Edward Snowden.
[02:25:12.165 --> 02:25:17.388]  All of these are political winners if Trump simply takes the same position that Robert Kennedy already had.
[02:25:17.788 --> 02:25:20.170]  Robert Kennedy said, I'm going to pardon Julian Assange.
[02:25:20.190 --> 02:25:21.531]  I'm going to pardon Ed Snowden.
[02:25:21.811 --> 02:25:26.814]  He came out in support of Amos Miller's case, the Amish farmer that the government's trying to shut down.
[02:25:27.134 --> 02:25:33.759]  He came out in support of the Brooke Jackson case, the big whistleblower case about the vaccine concerning COVID, concerning Pfizer.
[02:25:34.279 --> 02:25:43.601]  Trump should just get on board those trains, he can make sure he gets all the votes that would otherwise go to Robert Kennedy, and he would be a much stronger president in 2024.
[02:25:44.862 --> 02:25:53.944]  If he's, when he's dancing around with praising the vaccine, AWOL on all these key cases, and talking about putting Tim Scott on the ticket, he's dooming himself.
[02:25:54.004 --> 02:25:54.944]  Doesn't he get it?
[02:25:55.124 --> 02:25:55.984]  Doesn't he get it?
[02:25:56.324 --> 02:25:59.165]  That everywhere he goes for three years, plugging the shot, they boo him?
[02:25:59.565 --> 02:26:03.406]  And if you look at this, I mean, it's just, it's ridiculous.
[02:26:04.775 --> 02:26:05.115]  Completely.
[02:26:05.155 --> 02:26:08.237]  I mean, I'll give the system credit, they really rolled him on that.
[02:26:08.697 --> 02:26:15.700]  Because they said, you know, it's impossible to get a vaccine done that fast, but you're so unique, President Trump, I bet you can do it.
[02:26:16.060 --> 02:26:20.262]  And you probably better, you probably should do it, because we're probably going to have to lock down again.
[02:26:20.342 --> 02:26:23.044]  And the next week they come to him and say, sir, we have a fix.
[02:26:24.469 --> 02:26:25.049]  Exactly.
[02:26:25.490 --> 02:26:27.770]  I mean, we experienced this in live time.
[02:26:28.371 --> 02:26:33.433]  I remember when Trump retweeted me in March of 2020 saying he wasn't going to lock down.
[02:26:33.653 --> 02:26:35.634]  We were talking about it live on the show.
[02:26:35.894 --> 02:26:38.455]  And then a week later, they rolled him and got him to flip.
[02:26:38.995 --> 02:26:43.337]  And it's because they said, all these horrible things are going to happen unless you do what we tell you.
[02:26:43.617 --> 02:26:47.439]  But don't worry, we'll give you all the credit for stopping these horrible things from happening.
[02:26:47.919 --> 02:26:49.760]  And it was a trap and it was a setup.
[02:26:50.261 --> 02:26:58.707]  And you know, remember that when you were on 24 hours about don't escalate the bombing in Syria, don't escalate the bombing over that fake.
[02:26:59.107 --> 02:27:08.154]  You mean you called it out that that was not a Syria chemical weapons attack, that's now been confirmed in multiple settings by multiple international investigations.
[02:27:08.494 --> 02:27:09.595]  Trump took the bait then.
[02:27:09.615 --> 02:27:17.580]  But it was only because you and others were saying, don't escalate, don't escalate, don't escalate, that it didn't happen.
[02:27:17.940 --> 02:27:24.845]  This is where the people who really love Trump are the ones that got to protect him from his own vulnerability.
[02:27:25.245 --> 02:27:38.114]  And that vulnerability includes talking favorably about the vaccine, talking to have Tim Scott as a vice president, making these devastating decisions that would end any chance of him having a successful presidency.
[02:27:38.554 --> 02:27:44.117]  And a ticket to do so is to say, look, Robert Kennedy could take the election from you.
[02:27:44.157 --> 02:27:45.377]  He could cost you the election.
[02:27:45.657 --> 02:27:46.818]  You don't want that to happen.
[02:27:47.058 --> 02:27:52.721]  The best way you can stop that from happening, you're in competition, Trump loves competition, is those votes should be your votes.
[02:27:53.141 --> 02:27:55.362]  So get on the right side of the vaccine.
[02:27:55.402 --> 02:27:58.403]  Get on the right side of the Brooke Jackson case.
[02:27:58.483 --> 02:27:59.924]  Join the Amos Miller case.
[02:28:00.524 --> 02:28:02.705]  Do the right thing on Julian Assange and Ed Snowden.
[02:28:03.105 --> 02:28:07.307]  Put out a detailed plan to truly destroy and defund the Deep State.
[02:28:08.227 --> 02:28:10.708]  And Vivek has good ideas in that capacity.
[02:28:11.048 --> 02:28:11.248]  J.D.
[02:28:11.388 --> 02:28:13.248]  Vance has good ideas in that capacity.
[02:28:13.328 --> 02:28:15.489]  Rand Paul has good ideas in that capacity.
[02:28:15.569 --> 02:28:17.030]  Oh, what about Rand Paul as the VP?
[02:28:17.070 --> 02:28:18.210]  Stay there, let's answer that.
[02:28:18.570 --> 02:28:23.812]  Let's move on to Russia, the economy, the border, the fake cases against Trump with Robert Barnes.
[02:28:23.832 --> 02:28:24.952]  We'll come right back from break.
[02:28:25.272 --> 02:28:26.813]  Robert, where do people find your great shows?

[02:29:44.273 --> 02:29:47.155]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:29:47.215 --> 02:29:48.816]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:29:49.136 --> 02:29:52.219]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:29:52.419 --> 02:29:59.824]  But when we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[02:30:14.235 --> 02:30:16.940]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:30:17.782 --> 02:30:23.734]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[02:30:24.675 --> 02:30:25.597]  It's really just incredible.
[02:30:26.596 --> 02:30:29.459]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:30:29.479 --> 02:30:35.245]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:30:36.046 --> 02:30:39.030]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[02:30:39.070 --> 02:30:47.299]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[02:30:47.979 --> 02:30:51.641]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsaw.com.
[02:30:52.282 --> 02:30:56.904]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsaw.com, our funding problems will be over.

[02:31:19.128 --> 02:31:22.029]  But over time, our bodies produce less of it.
[02:31:23.400 --> 02:31:26.564]  Full of amino acids to produce nitric oxide.
[02:31:27.044 --> 02:31:31.569]  Nitric Boost helps raise the amount of nitric oxide in your body.
[02:31:32.739 --> 02:31:39.205]  Nitric oxide is needed for strength, cardiovascular function, and healthy neurotransmission.

[02:32:00.253 --> 02:32:01.674]  Last year we put this book out.
[02:32:02.514 --> 02:32:03.914]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[02:32:03.934 --> 02:32:05.715]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[02:32:06.295 --> 02:32:09.537]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[02:32:10.077 --> 02:32:10.977]  The Great Awakening.
[02:32:11.077 --> 02:32:14.879]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[02:32:15.339 --> 02:32:16.960]  This is such a powerful book.
[02:32:17.380 --> 02:32:25.986]  It covers all the globalist plans, the latest developments, how to stop them, and then gives an alternate plan of a society we could build together.
[02:32:26.306 --> 02:32:27.467]  That's why it's The Great Awakening.
[02:32:27.867 --> 02:32:29.968]  The Great Awakening is happening right now.
[02:32:30.229 --> 02:32:35.052]  You can get signed or unsigned copies of the book at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:32:35.332 --> 02:32:36.673]  This is a historic book.

[02:32:38.874 --> 02:32:46.380]  This is next level information and it's a great way to not just support the broadcast, but inform yourself to the next level and share the book with friends and family.

[02:32:55.927 --> 02:32:56.747]  It's a powerful book.
[02:32:56.967 --> 02:32:57.548]  Get yours now.
[02:32:59.529 --> 02:33:05.454]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.322 --> 02:33:29.205]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:31.167 --> 02:33:34.170]  So, we're in amazing times right now.
[02:33:34.190 --> 02:33:35.050]  We're in terrible times.
[02:33:35.130 --> 02:33:36.452]  The paradox is always there.
[02:33:36.532 --> 02:33:37.272]  Tell it to the cities.
[02:33:37.733 --> 02:33:39.814]  Robert Barnes, we just spent 20-something minutes.
[02:33:40.959 --> 02:33:43.062]  Trying to get Trump to get back on the straight and narrow.
[02:33:43.122 --> 02:33:44.944]  We love him, but we're not in a cult.
[02:33:45.064 --> 02:33:48.449]  We're not like Democrats who just get talking points from the power structure.
[02:33:48.509 --> 02:33:50.311]  We do the talking.
[02:33:50.371 --> 02:33:53.195]  We put people in power to carry out the will of the people.
[02:33:53.275 --> 02:33:54.216]  Declaration of Independence 2.0.
[02:33:55.277 --> 02:33:57.059]  But now let's talk about how great Trump is.
[02:33:57.520 --> 02:33:58.361]  I know you agree with me on that.
[02:33:58.401 --> 02:33:59.603]  We talked earlier before we went on air.
[02:34:01.184 --> 02:34:11.213]  The incredible demonization, the trials falling apart, Fannie Willis, the Georgia cases, the New York cases, what's happening with Jack Smith, all of it.
[02:34:11.233 --> 02:34:13.936]  Give us a breakdown as a top legal mind on this.
[02:34:13.956 --> 02:34:20.342]  There's also work for Trump about where this is and what you think they're going to do now because more and more they're shifting to, okay, he's going to win.
[02:34:22.352 --> 02:34:23.514]  Which we couldn't get overconfident.
[02:34:24.195 --> 02:34:24.816]  Still got to vote.
[02:34:25.216 --> 02:34:29.683]  But then we're going to have riots and the Insurrection Act will be pulled from him and he'll be removed.
[02:34:30.224 --> 02:34:33.449]  So let's talk about what they're currently doing and what you expect to happen in the next eight and a half months.
[02:34:34.793 --> 02:34:46.981]  Well, you know, what we're talking about from the get-go was that their ballot access denial plans were constitutionally ludicrous, legally without any basis, factually, actually, without any substantiation.
[02:34:47.441 --> 02:34:48.622]  And that was so clear.
[02:34:48.642 --> 02:34:54.646]  I mean, we had all these so-called legal experts on MSNBC and Washington Post and all these other places.
[02:34:55.106 --> 02:34:56.447]  I mean, Judge Ludig.
[02:34:56.827 --> 02:35:08.656]  You know, one of those fake conservatives, the guy who said it's okay for the Bush administration to kill Americans without due process of law, that nitwit was the one leading it with Lawrence Tribe.
[02:35:08.796 --> 02:35:18.243]  All of them got exposed, as the fakes and phonies and frauds they are, as even the liberal justices on the Supreme Court recognized that Trump belongs on the ballot.
[02:35:18.283 --> 02:35:20.685]  That was a 9-0 decision on that aspect.
[02:35:21.125 --> 02:35:37.513]  Now, what I thought was important was that there was a majority who went further than that and said, look, Congress, you can't keep him off the ballot if he wins on Election Day in November, unless you pass legislation before the election, which is never going to happen.
[02:35:37.934 --> 02:35:40.295]  So they've the now, unfortunately,
[02:35:41.388 --> 02:35:50.474]  The one judge, Republican conservative judge, who was not on board with that was the judge that we warned Trump about, Amy Coney Barrett.
[02:35:50.915 --> 02:36:05.525]  But I think what that tells us, the fact that Roberts and Kavanaugh were in that majority, tells us that Roberts doesn't want the court system to look like the means by which Trump was prevented from the American people putting him back in the White House.
[02:36:05.965 --> 02:36:08.648]  So Roberts is corrupt, but he's a political guy.
[02:36:09.228 --> 02:36:14.172]  Roberts is a guy who doesn't want the judiciary to look bad in the court of public opinion.
[02:36:14.593 --> 02:36:16.935]  And he's recognizing what we've been talking about.
[02:36:17.235 --> 02:36:25.803]  That as people watch these cases, it isn't Trump they have a worse opinion of, it's the American legal system that they have a worse opinion of.
[02:36:26.063 --> 02:36:28.065]  It's like the people who watch your cases.
[02:36:28.886 --> 02:36:39.337]  In Connecticut and Texas, they didn't come away with a worse opinion of you, they came away with a worse opinion of the judges of our legal system, that this could even happen.
[02:36:39.737 --> 02:36:46.845]  So I think Roberts and Kavanaugh recognize that the Supreme Court has to save the judiciary from itself.
[02:36:47.412 --> 02:36:50.133]  Because the New York courts have embarrassed the rule of law.
[02:36:50.453 --> 02:36:51.033]  The D.C.
[02:36:51.093 --> 02:36:52.954]  courts have embarrassed the rule of law.
[02:36:53.294 --> 02:36:59.856]  The only way to save it is to step in and give Trump immunity, and immunity, and it's also constitutional.
[02:37:00.216 --> 02:37:02.517]  If anybody has immunity, it's the President of the United States.
[02:37:02.877 --> 02:37:06.818]  The only remedy for prosecuting him is to impeach him and convict him.
[02:37:06.838 --> 02:37:11.140]  By the way, expand on that legally, because I'm not a lawyer, but I've read the Constitution and went through basic class on it.
[02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:17.027]  You have the separation of powers in government because if a local prosecutor can indict a president, they'll do it all the time.
[02:37:17.447 --> 02:37:19.370]  So only Congress can do that with impeachment.
[02:37:19.850 --> 02:37:24.817]  Explain that to people that the Supreme Court ruling didn't give Joe Biden new dictatorial power or Trump.
[02:37:25.137 --> 02:37:26.179]  It simply reaffirmed the law.
[02:37:28.062 --> 02:37:37.691]  From the time of our founding, our organizers, our founding generation, which includes more than just the intellectuals and the lawyers and the folks wearing the powdered wigs.
[02:37:38.051 --> 02:37:41.455]  It represented every American who took a gun to the field.
[02:37:41.735 --> 02:37:44.698]  Every American who engaged in the economic embargo.
[02:37:44.878 --> 02:37:48.682]  Every American was part of the American Revolution and part of our founders.
[02:37:49.122 --> 02:37:57.968]  They recognized from the beginning that if the president, who's the only nationally elected official, no other official is in our entire legal system.
[02:37:58.188 --> 02:38:00.690]  Because you can't have a committee during a war or an emergency.
[02:38:00.710 --> 02:38:02.851]  You gotta have one guy that's in charge in emergencies.
[02:38:03.231 --> 02:38:05.253]  You can't have everybody targeting him.
[02:38:06.433 --> 02:38:06.874]  Exactly.
[02:38:07.134 --> 02:38:10.196]  Because he's the one national official, he cannot be subject
[02:38:10.652 --> 02:38:18.619]  To the random, coercive whim of some local prosecutor somewhere in a country as diverse as America was even then.
[02:38:19.099 --> 02:38:29.368]  They recognized that there would be regional divides, that there would be geographic disputes, and so they couldn't allow somebody to weaponize their prosecutorial power, the threat of imprisonment.
[02:38:29.928 --> 02:38:40.414]  And use that to extort a president, to blackmail a president, by saying, look, if you don't do the policy I tell you to, as soon as you're out of the White House, I'm going to put you in prison.
[02:38:40.955 --> 02:38:47.599]  That makes the presidency subject to being hijacked and ransomed to any local prosecutor.
[02:38:47.619 --> 02:38:49.800]  It turns it into a puppet of the locals.
[02:38:51.641 --> 02:38:53.262]  Because Hogg can control the president.
[02:38:54.235 --> 02:38:55.016]  That's exactly right.
[02:38:55.256 --> 02:38:58.157]  I mean, whoa, that's what we have, right?
[02:38:58.398 --> 02:39:02.460]  I mean, isn't Fannie Willis basically the female version of Boss Hogg?
[02:39:02.740 --> 02:39:03.861]  I mean, she even looks like him.
[02:39:04.241 --> 02:39:07.403]  So, I mean, that's what's happened, and we can't allow that to happen.
[02:39:07.883 --> 02:39:09.885]  And otherwise, our country falls apart.
[02:39:10.005 --> 02:39:11.646]  Our Constitution collapses.
[02:39:11.926 --> 02:39:13.667]  Presidential power disappears.
[02:39:13.927 --> 02:39:15.648]  We don't have a nationally elected office.
[02:39:16.169 --> 02:39:17.750]  So how's that going for him now?
[02:39:17.830 --> 02:39:19.451]  Fannie Willis is totally exposed.
[02:39:20.391 --> 02:39:21.192]  What's going to happen there?
[02:39:21.232 --> 02:39:22.152]  What's going to happen in New York?
[02:39:22.252 --> 02:39:24.173]  All these cases, they're all being derailed.
[02:39:25.194 --> 02:39:36.700]  It shows that, you know, what we've been talking about for years is the great danger of our current system of people in power is that they're not, it's not just that their moral compass is broken, they're on the slow side of the equation.
[02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:38.341]  They rode the short bus to school.
[02:39:38.741 --> 02:39:44.524]  And what happens when you, I always say, I don't mind criminals, I don't mind dumb people, you put them together and you got a bad combination.
[02:39:44.924 --> 02:39:47.065]  Right now, we are governed by dumb criminals.
[02:39:47.365 --> 02:39:50.546]  There's no better living example than the president, the man in the White House.
[02:39:51.006 --> 02:39:55.447]  I mean, he looks like a dumb street thug from the streets of, you know, eastern Philly.
[02:39:55.727 --> 02:39:57.207]  You know, I mean, that's who and what he is.
[02:39:58.568 --> 02:40:00.828]  He's Rocky without the character or the IQ.
[02:40:01.169 --> 02:40:02.229]  I mean, it's bad.
[02:40:02.609 --> 02:40:04.609]  And so you see that with Fannie Willis.
[02:40:04.750 --> 02:40:06.370]  They're not only corrupt, but they're stupid.
[02:40:06.730 --> 02:40:07.551]  They get caught.
[02:40:07.591 --> 02:40:09.031]  They lie in obvious ways.
[02:40:09.291 --> 02:40:13.074]  She's committed perjury now half a dozen times just in this case.
[02:40:13.394 --> 02:40:16.595]  She's committed obstruction of justice repeated times.
[02:40:16.816 --> 02:40:18.917]  Again, we go back to what we talked about at the beginning of the show.
[02:40:19.237 --> 02:40:20.738]  Confession through projection.
[02:40:21.078 --> 02:40:25.060]  Fannie Willis, what she accused Trump of, is what Fannie Willis has been doing.
[02:40:25.460 --> 02:40:28.762]  Money laundering, obstruction of justice, fraud on the legal system.
[02:40:29.162 --> 02:40:30.163]  She's been in doing it.
[02:40:30.543 --> 02:40:31.743]  I have no doubt it's true.
[02:40:31.783 --> 02:40:34.205]  In New York, I have no doubt it's true of Jack Smith.
[02:40:34.525 --> 02:40:38.267]  Jack Smith is a deep state hack who has no constitutional authority.
[02:40:38.307 --> 02:40:40.948]  He's a former chief UN prosecutor.
[02:40:40.968 --> 02:40:42.429]  Exactly.
[02:40:42.449 --> 02:40:47.651]  Who is the most overturned, isn't he like the most overturned living fed in court?
[02:40:47.711 --> 02:40:48.472]  I mean, the guy's a fraud.
[02:40:49.468 --> 02:40:53.730]  Well not only that, remember he's connected to all those deep state cover-ups over in Europe.
[02:40:54.070 --> 02:40:59.313]  I mean, you go back to Rachel Weisz's movie, The Whistleblower, you've talked about it forever.
[02:40:59.393 --> 02:41:05.096]  I mean, there's Epstein-related connections there, human trafficking in Europe, the Clinton Foundation in Haiti.
[02:41:05.376 --> 02:41:06.997]  Look at what's happening in Haiti right now.
[02:41:07.257 --> 02:41:11.019]  That's a function in production of the Clinton Foundation over 20-25 years.
[02:41:12.660 --> 02:41:20.581]  And now they've got their leading opponent in Haiti is a guy who hangs out with a group called Barbecue and it ain't the kind of barbecues you and I like.
[02:41:20.881 --> 02:41:23.402]  They're doing human cannibalism down there in Haiti.
[02:41:23.742 --> 02:41:26.502]  And that's who may be taking over the government.
[02:41:27.223 --> 02:41:28.303]  This is a disaster.
[02:41:28.343 --> 02:41:30.123]  We have all these dumb criminals in power.
[02:41:30.143 --> 02:41:33.384]  It all goes back to Clinton's looting Haiti after the earthquake.
[02:41:34.624 --> 02:41:35.144]  Exactly.
[02:41:35.304 --> 02:41:37.924]  And not only that, they were connected to the human smuggling operation.
[02:41:38.144 --> 02:41:41.205]  Their chief of staff got convicted of it.
[02:41:42.421 --> 02:41:42.922]  Exactly.
[02:41:43.122 --> 02:41:48.469]  Remember the UN people that later on turned out were just busy raping young girls all the way out through Haiti?
[02:41:48.869 --> 02:41:52.434]  I mean, that's who, and you know that's an AP special investigation.
[02:41:53.379 --> 02:41:54.159]  That's exactly right.
[02:41:55.580 --> 02:41:59.262]  You brought it to light before all of them did, but now there's no dispute about it.
[02:41:59.342 --> 02:42:06.506]  It's been confirmed in multiple settings by multiple independent investigations from even establishment institutional sources.
[02:42:06.986 --> 02:42:08.307]  And now we're seeing the blowback.
[02:42:08.327 --> 02:42:09.528]  We're seeing the consequences.
[02:42:09.788 --> 02:42:15.791]  You end up with some group of cannibals that's going to take over an entire country if things keep going a certain way.
[02:42:15.911 --> 02:42:16.932]  You're not just saying that, guys.
[02:42:16.952 --> 02:42:19.113]  Type in Haiti cannibalism.
[02:42:19.613 --> 02:42:22.775]  They admit they're just mowing down random groups of people and eating them.
[02:42:24.429 --> 02:42:24.770]  Exactly.
[02:42:24.850 --> 02:42:26.371]  I mean, they even filmed themselves doing it!
[02:42:26.852 --> 02:42:28.274]  Yeah, I have the video.
[02:42:28.354 --> 02:42:28.954]  I've even shown it.
[02:42:28.974 --> 02:42:29.695]  It's just so horrible.
[02:42:30.696 --> 02:42:31.778]  It sounds like I'm lying.
[02:42:31.818 --> 02:42:34.501]  Like, you tell the truth, but your brain can't believe it.
[02:42:35.720 --> 02:42:36.161]  Completely.
[02:42:36.881 --> 02:42:41.986]  And where Haiti is, is where Ukraine will be in two years if we don't get a reversal.
[02:42:42.306 --> 02:42:46.551]  That's where Trump was right from the very beginning, saying the Ukraine war is going to be a disaster.
[02:42:46.571 --> 02:42:47.672]  So let me shift gears to that.
[02:42:47.732 --> 02:42:54.438]  We have mixed signals three weeks ago with the Senate, saying, OK, maybe a peace deal, a rebuilding, which is another laundering operation.
[02:42:54.839 --> 02:42:55.519]  You've got all these
[02:42:56.721 --> 02:42:57.362]  We're good to go.
[02:43:14.567 --> 02:43:19.790]  If this war continues for several more years, Ukraine will end up looking like Haiti does now.
[02:43:20.510 --> 02:43:22.371]  That's what a disaster it will be.
[02:43:22.391 --> 02:43:25.893]  It will be a disaster for Europe, a disaster for America, a disaster for the world.
[02:43:25.913 --> 02:43:28.594]  Sure, my question is, do you think they're getting mixed signals?
[02:43:29.034 --> 02:43:33.516]  Are they about to do a peace deal, or are they about to accelerate?
[02:43:33.696 --> 02:43:38.619]  When even the Pope is saying, please do a peace deal, he said the white flag of courage.
[02:43:39.560 --> 02:43:40.100]  Completely.
[02:43:40.720 --> 02:43:56.843]  That's the sign that everybody with any IQ, I mean the Pope's not exactly the most ethical person on the planet at the moment, but anybody with an IQ realizes they have to do a peace deal now before disaster comes to Ukraine, Europe, and America and the world.
[02:43:57.104 --> 02:43:59.724]  Unfortunately, Zelensky's already turned it down.
[02:44:00.044 --> 02:44:04.405]  The corrupt, rogue actors of Ukraine who see this as simply a constant
[02:44:05.273 --> 02:44:07.034]  I mean, they're dragging Ukrainian kids.
[02:44:23.761 --> 02:44:25.122]  We're good to go.
[02:44:54.682 --> 02:44:55.082]  Exactly.
[02:44:55.462 --> 02:45:04.626]  I mean, I think we're back to the late 50s, early 60s, when our generals wanted to trick President John Kennedy into launching a nuclear war.
[02:45:04.646 --> 02:45:05.887]  LLM and Sir Curtis LeMay.
[02:45:05.967 --> 02:45:13.591]  Talk about that, and then let's go back to the election with eight months left, and the system knows they're losing, they admit they're losing, what are they going to pull?
[02:45:14.980 --> 02:45:17.061]  Well, I think we're seeing what they might try to pull.
[02:45:17.081 --> 02:45:26.424]  I mean, they might try to pull a actual limited, what they call a limited nuclear war, which would be an utter abominable disaster.
[02:45:26.804 --> 02:45:28.325]  You've been talking about it for years.
[02:45:28.745 --> 02:45:35.827]  Why are all these rich, powerful people building bunkers as if we're in the peak of the Cold War all around the world?
[02:45:36.307 --> 02:45:41.449]  You know, name an oligarch, and chances are he owns a bunker in some exotic location.
[02:45:41.789 --> 02:45:43.730]  I think, doesn't Bill Gates own like three?
[02:45:44.631 --> 02:45:47.493]  I mean, so, Lee, according to various reports... No, no, no, he's right.
[02:45:47.513 --> 02:45:48.954]  There's about three we know of.
[02:45:49.254 --> 02:45:54.257]  And what's crazy is, take Zuckerberg building a ten-story deep bunker in Kauai.
[02:45:54.338 --> 02:45:55.078]  Everybody hates him.
[02:45:55.098 --> 02:45:56.119]  Everyone building it hates him.
[02:45:56.479 --> 02:45:58.400]  How do they think they're safe in some bunker?
[02:45:58.981 --> 02:46:00.061]  It's a giant target.
[02:46:00.422 --> 02:46:03.023]  They'd be safe on a mountaintop behind a hill in a shack.
[02:46:03.404 --> 02:46:03.804]  Not there.
[02:46:04.963 --> 02:46:06.286]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:46:07.007 --> 02:46:12.518]  They don't understand the course to actual survival because they've been in such privileged, powerful positions.
[02:46:12.559 --> 02:46:15.464]  Yeah, you don't want to be in a big palace everybody knows about when stuff goes down.
[02:46:16.559 --> 02:46:16.799]  Exactly.
[02:46:16.819 --> 02:46:23.223]  It's like somebody who really believed those, you know, drills the kids did in the 50s, where they, you know... Duck and cover!
[02:46:23.523 --> 02:46:24.124]  Duck and cover!
[02:46:24.164 --> 02:46:25.765]  Take cover under your desk, right?
[02:46:25.845 --> 02:46:26.565]  Under your desk.
[02:46:26.605 --> 02:46:27.286]  That's going to work.
[02:46:27.966 --> 02:46:30.828]  I mean, those clued just intended to mess with their minds.
[02:46:31.408 --> 02:46:33.069]  It's kind of like airport security.
[02:46:33.209 --> 02:46:36.111]  It's intended to just get you accustomed to... Well, let's talk about that.
[02:46:36.171 --> 02:46:37.732]  People really get the videos now.
[02:46:37.752 --> 02:46:39.313]  They get 50 million views a day.
[02:46:39.333 --> 02:46:40.034]  They're all over X.
[02:46:47.677 --> 02:46:55.840]  My grandfather's favorite cartoon in his office was what to do in case of nuclear war.
[02:46:56.120 --> 02:46:59.701]  You get down, you put your head between your legs, and you kiss your ass goodbye.
[02:46:59.721 --> 02:47:01.362]  I mean, that's what those are.
[02:47:02.442 --> 02:47:06.464]  But what's scary is we got people so dumb, so dangerous, combining the both.
[02:47:06.944 --> 02:47:13.188]  I never would have thought I'd say I miss Henry Kissinger, but at least Henry Kissinger wasn't incompetent.
[02:47:13.569 --> 02:47:15.730]  He was morally corrupt, but he wasn't incompetent.
[02:47:15.750 --> 02:47:20.093]  That was real politic, and he was the one a year ago before he died saying we should end the Russian war.
[02:47:20.153 --> 02:47:26.918]  So going back to this, we have disconnected from reality.
[02:47:27.298 --> 02:47:28.719]  How do we bring them back to reality?
[02:47:30.764 --> 02:47:33.146]  We gotta win 2024, to be honest with you.
[02:47:33.187 --> 02:47:34.428]  That's gonna be the only way.
[02:47:35.128 --> 02:47:37.570]  And we gotta have the best version of Trump.
[02:47:37.771 --> 02:47:39.352]  We need Trump to be peak Trump.
[02:47:39.572 --> 02:47:40.593]  Can't be average Trump.
[02:47:40.913 --> 02:47:42.175]  Can't be 2020 Trump.
[02:47:42.195 --> 02:47:46.719]  Yeah, why do you think, like a dog to vomit, he goes back to people that are his enemies?
[02:47:48.466 --> 02:47:54.667]  Because he thinks right now he's got an easy path, and he thinks the best way to maintain that easy path is to play ball with the insiders.
[02:47:55.147 --> 02:47:58.248]  Even though they knife him every single time.
[02:47:58.628 --> 02:47:59.788]  And they will knife him again.
[02:48:00.428 --> 02:48:03.069]  And it's like somebody... Yeah, they lied to him.
[02:48:03.329 --> 02:48:04.489]  That's why he doesn't like me.
[02:48:04.509 --> 02:48:07.390]  Because he'll call up and tell me how great I am.
[02:48:07.410 --> 02:48:08.670]  I want to hear how great I am.
[02:48:08.970 --> 02:48:10.310]  By the way, Fiona Hill's an operative.
[02:48:10.330 --> 02:48:11.130]  This guy's an operative.
[02:48:11.571 --> 02:48:12.371]  He doesn't want to hear that.
[02:48:12.411 --> 02:48:12.911]  I don't know why.
[02:48:14.684 --> 02:48:17.264]  People say he's bad though, he's not.
[02:48:17.585 --> 02:48:18.645]  They actually hate him.
[02:48:19.085 --> 02:48:20.525]  The power structure is not like Trump.
[02:48:21.585 --> 02:48:22.505]  Not exactly.
[02:48:22.805 --> 02:48:35.808]  I mean, it's like somebody we know who has a tendency to date the wrong kind of person, and you try to tell them, hey, bad idea, and because they're so emotionally invested in it, they get mad at you rather than get mad at themselves.
[02:48:36.508 --> 02:48:42.849]  And that's what, and God bless Trump, but that's, now down deep, Trump wants people to come up and smack him in the face when he's in danger.
[02:48:43.189 --> 02:48:46.335]  Well, that's what Roger first told me when I was first talking to Trump like eight years ago.
[02:48:46.355 --> 02:48:48.138]  He goes, don't kiss his ass.
[02:48:48.238 --> 02:48:49.120]  Be very serious.
[02:48:49.140 --> 02:48:49.801]  That's what he respects.
[02:48:49.821 --> 02:48:51.324]  Well, that's what I've done, but I went too far.
[02:48:51.724 --> 02:48:52.766]  But I know Trump's good.
[02:48:52.786 --> 02:48:56.333]  He's done a lot of good, but God Almighty, it's just crazy.
[02:48:57.199 --> 02:49:00.363]  Well, to be honest with you, that's why I think we're blessed with Robert Kennedy's campaign.
[02:49:00.743 --> 02:49:10.215]  Because that's going to be the only thing that keeps Trump the best version of Trump, is the risk that in competition he loses votes to Robert Kennedy.
[02:49:10.255 --> 02:49:12.057]  You think we'll see Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[02:49:12.077 --> 02:49:12.498]  in the debates?
[02:49:12.578 --> 02:49:13.179]  I'd love to see that.
[02:49:14.076 --> 02:49:14.756]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:49:14.796 --> 02:49:16.257]  In fact, look for Kennedy to search.
[02:49:16.858 --> 02:49:25.483]  As long as Trump's people are running a generic 2020 campaign and Trump's making these kind of mistakes, then Robert Kennedy is going to search.
[02:49:25.663 --> 02:49:27.324]  Well, let me tell you a story about Robert F. Kennedy.
[02:49:27.985 --> 02:49:33.688]  I've thought he's great for decades, great on Gliber's stage, real environmentalist, don't have toxic waste, great guy.
[02:49:34.449 --> 02:49:41.193]  I got told a couple of years ago, I'll leave it at that, Robert loves you, but his wife will get too mad if he comes on.
[02:49:42.126 --> 02:49:43.948]  And you know, I was told the same thing by a lot of other guests.
[02:49:44.489 --> 02:49:52.296]  And then she's in, what was it, Vanity Fair a few months ago saying, I told my husband he's not allowed to be on Alex's show.
[02:49:52.797 --> 02:49:56.620]  It's not about him coming on my show, it's about we're not electing his wife.
[02:49:57.623 --> 02:50:02.805]  And my wife tells me what she thinks, but she doesn't brag to Vanity Fair that she tells me what to do.
[02:50:03.685 --> 02:50:11.087]  And so we're criticizing Trump, but what's up with Kennedy saying he takes orders from his wife who made people take vaccines to go to her house?
[02:50:11.667 --> 02:50:13.488]  We're not electing Larry David's wife.
[02:50:15.695 --> 02:50:21.517]  Yeah, I mean, I've had that discussion on and off with Robert Kennedy for multiple years, concerning you.
[02:50:21.897 --> 02:50:24.978]  And he has progressed, in my opinion, on that.
[02:50:24.998 --> 02:50:27.659]  Because he started out with a very caricatured view of you.
[02:50:28.580 --> 02:50:31.181]  And now it doesn't have that same caricatured view.
[02:50:31.621 --> 02:50:34.262]  No, I know that, but separate me, Robert.
[02:50:35.445 --> 02:50:38.787]  Why is his wife in the news saying, I've got him by the balls?
[02:50:39.068 --> 02:50:42.090]  She told that to major publications.
[02:50:42.910 --> 02:50:45.052]  Don't worry, I've got control of my husband.
[02:50:45.092 --> 02:50:45.812]  Nothing against her.
[02:50:46.173 --> 02:50:48.074]  She's the one bringing me up, so she did it.
[02:50:50.576 --> 02:50:51.636]  I'm not sure why that is.
[02:50:53.478 --> 02:50:56.600]  In being around them both, I don't get that personal impression.
[02:50:57.071 --> 02:51:09.717]  So, I think it's particular to the people wondering why, given that you and he both have exposed a lot of problems over the last five years, there's a natural political alignment there.
[02:51:09.797 --> 02:51:12.119]  Sure, but moving on, Robert, I want to get this straight.
[02:51:12.799 --> 02:51:14.200]  I don't care about him coming on.
[02:51:14.600 --> 02:51:15.460]  I don't care about that.
[02:51:15.940 --> 02:51:18.262]  I care about his wife saying she's in charge.
[02:51:18.802 --> 02:51:20.863]  She should run for office if that's the case.
[02:51:21.043 --> 02:51:22.884]  I don't really think that's true, is the short answer.
[02:51:24.413 --> 02:51:30.181]  I think that's a convenient fig leaf for dodging an issue that he should confront more directly.
[02:51:39.756 --> 02:51:43.278]  Knowledgeable and wise and kind of the leader.
[02:51:43.559 --> 02:51:46.340]  I don't need to say that, but everybody knows I'm really know what's going on.
[02:51:46.881 --> 02:51:47.641]  Tucker knows it.
[02:51:47.681 --> 02:51:50.543]  Joe Rogan has said Alex Jones is the most accurate person in the world.
[02:51:50.843 --> 02:51:51.824]  He told Aaron Rodgers that.
[02:51:52.124 --> 02:51:53.986]  I don't expect that, but people know that's true.
[02:51:54.286 --> 02:51:55.487]  I would say you're as knowledgeable as I am.
[02:51:55.507 --> 02:51:56.187]  You're not as prominent.
[02:51:56.227 --> 02:51:56.868]  You're super prominent.
[02:51:57.328 --> 02:52:02.371]  All I'm saying is if someone's scared to touch the touchstone, we have to worry about them.
[02:52:02.471 --> 02:52:03.432]  I don't want to be powerful.
[02:52:03.492 --> 02:52:05.153]  I want to just relax and beat the new world order.
[02:52:05.553 --> 02:52:08.655]  But if people are scared of me, it shows they're still intimidated.
[02:52:09.796 --> 02:52:10.779]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'
[02:52:10.759 --> 02:52:13.507]  's wife Git, the power is in rejecting the system?
[02:52:13.868 --> 02:52:14.790]  Elon Musk gets that.
[02:52:15.876 --> 02:52:22.680]  Oh, I absolutely agree, and I think there's a lot of limitations to what Kennedy can do, and I don't think at this point, 2024, Kennedy can win.
[02:52:23.220 --> 02:52:28.003]  I see the utility of a Kennedy campaign primarily being about motivating Trump.
[02:52:28.123 --> 02:52:28.484]  I agree.
[02:52:28.544 --> 02:52:32.986]  Getting, you know, get Trump, like some people are worried, like, oh, Barnes, are you saying vote Kennedy over Trump?
[02:52:33.026 --> 02:52:33.927]  I'm not saying that at all.
[02:52:34.287 --> 02:52:40.411]  I'm saying, get Trump to believe that there are people who will, so that will get Trump awake.
[02:52:41.392 --> 02:52:48.157]  The only thing that's going to motivate him to be the best version of himself is if he thinks Kennedy can take some votes from him.
[02:52:48.557 --> 02:52:50.639]  But Barnes, that's what I'm saying.
[02:52:50.779 --> 02:52:53.001]  I don't care about Kennedy on my show.
[02:52:53.021 --> 02:52:55.583]  This is a message to him or his wife.
[02:52:55.603 --> 02:52:56.524]  I'm sure she's a great person.
[02:52:56.784 --> 02:52:57.305]  Don't know her.
[02:52:58.785 --> 02:53:02.528]  She shouldn't be scared of the system coming on my show.
[02:53:02.788 --> 02:53:04.089]  She should say no comment.
[02:53:04.570 --> 02:53:08.973]  The fact it shows she's still intimidated by them when they're used up.
[02:53:09.033 --> 02:53:10.674]  They're a joke.
[02:53:10.894 --> 02:53:12.875]  She should be avant-garde like Musk.
[02:53:13.396 --> 02:53:16.998]  Musk retweeted my interview and said this is important to watch with Tucker Carlson.
[02:53:17.379 --> 02:53:18.099]  He gets it.
[02:53:18.820 --> 02:53:21.662]  So I'm saying to her, you say you're a patriot.
[02:53:22.649 --> 02:53:25.275]  I don't care if she cares about me or he comes on.
[02:53:25.656 --> 02:53:28.904]  Just don't grovel to Vanity Fair.
[02:53:28.924 --> 02:53:29.525]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:53:30.504 --> 02:53:32.165]  Oh, I agree entirely.
[02:53:32.285 --> 02:53:34.687]  Once you go down the red pill, you gotta go all the way down.
[02:53:34.967 --> 02:53:37.569]  Going halfway ain't gonna get you to where you need to get to go.
[02:53:37.950 --> 02:53:41.032]  Either for yourself or any people or cause that you care about.
[02:53:41.052 --> 02:53:45.195]  I mean, basically, it's the same point we're making about Trump.
[02:53:45.255 --> 02:53:45.935]  Go all in.
[02:53:46.616 --> 02:53:49.538]  Don't try to go half in, part of the way in, side of the way in.
[02:53:50.199 --> 02:53:51.079]  Go all the way in.
[02:53:51.740 --> 02:53:52.660]  Exactly.
[02:53:52.700 --> 02:53:55.382]  We're telling Trump, and we're telling RFK Jr.
[02:53:55.402 --> 02:53:55.863]  and his wife,
[02:53:57.515 --> 02:53:58.118]  Go all in.
[02:53:58.199 --> 02:53:59.545]  In closing, we've got three minutes left.
[02:53:59.585 --> 02:54:00.690]  What else do you want to add, Robert Barnes?
[02:54:02.279 --> 02:54:05.320]  I mean, I think, again, it's thanks to the ordinary.
[02:54:05.540 --> 02:54:07.060]  People forget their own power.
[02:54:07.480 --> 02:54:13.321]  The government and the media and the Bill Gates of the world, he doesn't have all these fact-checking fake organizations.
[02:54:13.841 --> 02:54:18.442]  They don't have all this power because they don't think you have the real power.
[02:54:18.822 --> 02:54:24.923]  They don't spend all this money trying to convince you of things that aren't true if your opinion did not matter.
[02:54:25.263 --> 02:54:26.844]  The court of public opinion matters.
[02:54:26.884 --> 02:54:28.344]  We saw that with the Supreme Court.
[02:54:28.604 --> 02:54:29.104]  Exactly.
[02:54:29.124 --> 02:54:32.185]  The propaganda wouldn't be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[02:54:33.346 --> 02:54:34.346]  That's exactly right.
[02:54:34.546 --> 02:54:38.208]  And the greatest trick the devil ever pulled is convincing people he doesn't exist.
[02:54:38.608 --> 02:54:42.989]  The great trick the system ever pulls is convincing you you cannot resist.
[02:54:43.389 --> 02:54:44.030]  Look at Trump.
[02:54:44.270 --> 02:54:46.671]  Most people would have folded under all that legal pressure.
[02:54:47.031 --> 02:54:50.412]  He stood up to it and he's going to prevail because he stood up to it.
[02:54:51.532 --> 02:54:52.553]  Look at Infowars.
[02:54:52.773 --> 02:54:53.893]  Infowars could have folded.
[02:54:54.253 --> 02:54:56.194]  That's what you were supposed to do five years ago.
[02:54:56.214 --> 02:54:57.434]  Supposed to go away.
[02:54:57.494 --> 02:54:58.874]  Supposed to stay quiet.
[02:54:58.894 --> 02:55:03.275]  Supposed to beg mercy from your so-called superiors.
[02:55:03.976 --> 02:55:12.778]  But because you and the audience stayed with you, stuck with you, no matter what happened, no matter what a bankruptcy court's trying to do, no matter what a Texas or
[02:55:13.038 --> 02:55:30.750]  Connecticut courts trying to do, no matter what plaintiff's lawyers are trying to do, no matter what a lying press is trying to do, because people kept going to InfoWarsStore.com and got things that make their own lives better in the process, make them healthier, wealthier, and wiser, while keeping InfoWars on the air.
[02:55:31.150 --> 02:55:37.494]  That's why the power of the people to exercise that power is the fifth pillar of power.
[02:55:43.298 --> 02:55:45.060]  Lady, look where the world's going.
[02:55:45.160 --> 02:55:51.306]  Join Joe Rogan and Robert Barnes and Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump and stop trying to have feet in both worlds.
[02:55:52.447 --> 02:55:53.788]  Oh, absolutely!
[02:55:54.089 --> 02:56:00.075]  And I get there's a natural temptation for Trump to say, hey, I should just work with the system.
[02:56:00.095 --> 02:56:02.177]  That'll make it easier for me to get back in.
[02:56:02.197 --> 02:56:03.778]  Yeah, stop pacifying!
[02:56:06.548 --> 02:56:06.968]  Exactly.
[02:56:07.208 --> 02:56:19.832]  That, you know, if I'm Sheryl Hines and I'm part of the Hollywood world, that I want to stay in the Hollywood world, I'm going to try to minimize it and say, yeah, Bobby Kennedy's challenging everything, but don't worry, at least I'm against Alex Jones.
[02:56:20.212 --> 02:56:21.532]  That doesn't work.
[02:56:21.732 --> 02:56:23.113]  Those compromises never work.
[02:56:23.473 --> 02:56:27.174]  You betray yourself, you betray your cause, you betray everything you care about.
[02:56:27.574 --> 02:56:30.014]  So, I mean, I know they're both great people.
[02:56:30.334 --> 02:56:30.915]  I love Trump.
[02:56:31.115 --> 02:56:32.015]  Trump's a great person.
[02:56:32.355 --> 02:56:35.579]  But we're not selling out our morals for them.
[02:56:35.959 --> 02:56:39.003]  We're going to be integral and have integrity no matter what.
[02:56:40.084 --> 02:56:46.852]  And we want them all to be the best version of themselves so that the American people can get the benefit of the best version of themselves.
[02:56:46.872 --> 02:56:47.052]  Exactly.
[02:56:47.072 --> 02:56:48.674]  We don't criticize them out of hate.
[02:56:48.994 --> 02:56:52.098]  We respect and admire them and want them to fully join us.
[02:56:53.171 --> 02:56:54.091]  Because we need to!
[02:56:54.151 --> 02:56:56.212]  By the way, we've got to go, we've got to do five more minutes.
[02:56:56.772 --> 02:56:58.432]  Elon Musk is nothing but impressive.
[02:56:58.972 --> 02:56:59.753]  I don't know your view of him.
[02:56:59.773 --> 02:57:00.873]  Oh, he keeps getting better and better.
[02:57:01.113 --> 02:57:03.193]  He's suing Bill Gates over OpenAI!
[02:57:03.414 --> 02:57:04.394]  We haven't talked in weeks.
[02:57:04.414 --> 02:57:05.334]  You're so hard to get on.
[02:57:05.374 --> 02:57:06.054]  Barnes, stay there.
[02:57:06.454 --> 02:57:07.154]  We're going to go on a break.
[02:57:08.355 --> 02:57:10.195]  Five more minutes with Barnes before the guest host takes over.
[02:57:10.595 --> 02:57:11.676]  Owen Schroeder, 3pm.
[02:57:12.336 --> 02:57:14.936]  We may be here another ten years, we may be shut down next week, folks.
[02:57:15.096 --> 02:57:16.077]  We're down to that, but it doesn't matter.
[02:57:16.917 --> 02:57:17.297]  Believe me.
[02:57:18.407 --> 02:57:22.710]  They only hurt the crew, which they've taken my loyalty for weakness and that's not even happening.
[02:57:22.770 --> 02:57:24.831]  So that's just incredible.
[02:57:25.412 --> 02:57:27.333]  I told the crew, I said, they're shutting us down right now.
[02:57:27.353 --> 02:57:28.394]  And they're like, we believe you.
[02:57:28.694 --> 02:57:31.096]  And they had a filing last night to do it.
[02:57:32.036 --> 02:57:34.698]  I just, I can't believe God has given me such a sermon.
[02:57:34.998 --> 02:57:36.079]  Praise God.
[02:57:36.339 --> 02:57:37.300]  Good Lord.
[02:57:37.420 --> 02:57:38.101]  I love this.
[02:57:38.801 --> 02:57:40.722]  The truth is power.
[02:57:41.583 --> 02:57:43.144]  Hour number four.
[02:57:43.444 --> 02:57:44.125]  Stay with us.
[02:57:50.785 --> 02:57:53.266]  We have products that will change your life that are amazing.
[02:57:54.207 --> 02:57:57.008]  I want to sell you products that really work, so you want them again.
[02:57:58.009 --> 02:57:59.990]  But if you don't support us, we won't be here.
[02:58:01.451 --> 02:58:05.173]  Plus, you really need Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, 95% curcuminoid.
[02:58:05.733 --> 02:58:08.555]  The strongest other top brands are 75, 80%.
[02:58:08.875 --> 02:58:09.535]  Nobody makes it 95.
[02:58:09.635 --> 02:58:11.876]  We went to the top, one of the top makers.
[02:58:11.916 --> 02:58:13.137]  We said, we want the strongest you can make.
[02:58:13.437 --> 02:58:15.358]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, 40% off.
[02:58:15.738 --> 02:58:16.799]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:58:17.339 --> 02:58:18.240]  We have Nitric Boost.
[02:58:19.480 --> 02:58:19.661]  40% off.
[02:58:19.681 --> 02:58:21.242]  We've been selling Nitric Boost for a couple years.
[02:58:21.262 --> 02:58:24.424]  Never had it below $25 because there was hardly any profit there.
[02:58:24.484 --> 02:58:27.466]  We went to a place that gives us stuff just as good or even better.
[02:58:27.486 --> 02:58:28.326]  That's where we're getting it from.
[02:58:28.887 --> 02:58:31.669]  And it's 40% off passing the savings on to you.
[02:58:32.289 --> 02:58:32.869]  Nitric Boost.
[02:58:32.889 --> 02:58:33.670]  You need to experience it.
[02:58:33.690 --> 02:58:34.210]  You need to take it.
[02:58:34.731 --> 02:58:37.793]  So, InfoWarsTore.com for Nitric Boost.
[02:58:39.154 --> 02:58:42.816]  And so many other great products as well, like Turbo Force, 10-hour clean energy back in stock.
[02:58:43.357 --> 02:58:45.238]  InfoWarsTore.com, Turbo Force.
[02:58:48.300 --> 02:58:54.024]  I'm not perfect and I'm under a lot of stress, but if I didn't have the supplements we have and we promote, I wouldn't be able to continue to be on air.
[02:58:54.605 --> 02:59:02.751]  And when you go to MFullWarStore.com, you are funding the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists in an operation that the enemy admits has been the most effective at exposing them.
[02:59:02.951 --> 02:59:04.532]  Because we're fearless and we don't back down.
[02:59:04.912 --> 02:59:05.913]  We got God on our side.
[02:59:06.173 --> 02:59:07.694]  But God needs to work through you.
[02:59:08.034 --> 02:59:13.338]  You've got to make the decision to get great products you already need at MFullWarStore.com, and that is a 360 win.
[02:59:13.939 --> 02:59:16.901]  Nitric Boost, without me even knowing, became our number three bestseller.
[02:59:17.581 --> 02:59:19.183]  Because people loved it so much.
[02:59:19.203 --> 02:59:20.124]  They had such great effects.
[02:59:20.144 --> 02:59:26.610]  It's got all these natural compounds that clean out the blood, open up your arteries and veins, the capillaries, clean out your heart, your brain, everything.
[02:59:27.411 --> 02:59:29.153]  Well, we got an even better manufacturer.
[02:59:29.173 --> 02:59:33.997]  The other one was great, but one that's even better with even higher quality ingredients at a lower price.
[02:59:34.998 --> 02:59:37.380]  So I could never offer nitric boosts.
[02:59:37.440 --> 02:59:38.902]  It cost us so much to make.
[02:59:39.702 --> 02:59:41.924]  And now we can offer it for 40% off.
[02:59:42.485 --> 02:59:46.268]  Infowarsstore.com nitric boosts finally back in stock.
[02:59:46.288 --> 02:59:47.910]  40% off out of the gates.
[02:59:49.951 --> 02:59:54.035]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:54.576 --> 02:59:55.857]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:13.956 --> 03:00:18.419]  All right, Gerald Solente of the Top Trend Forecaster takes over in two minutes, six minutes.
[03:00:19.640 --> 03:00:21.521]  But listen, I'm not a sellout.
[03:00:21.641 --> 03:00:26.684]  I was offered deals by Henry Kissinger, Roger Ailes, Fox News, everything, and I said no.
[03:00:28.045 --> 03:00:32.568]  But if I look at Elon Musk reaching 200, 300 million people a day conservatively,
[03:00:33.345 --> 03:00:37.548]  With everything I've said, and I'm not saying he took it from me, but I use the analogy of a burning house.
[03:00:37.908 --> 03:00:39.089]  People won't come out of the burning house.
[03:00:39.389 --> 03:00:40.270]  He put it out today.
[03:00:40.831 --> 03:00:44.593]  Other people have made that analogy, but he is dialed in.
[03:00:44.653 --> 03:00:45.294]  I'll leave it at that.
[03:00:45.314 --> 03:00:51.198]  I'm not going to tell people behind the scenes inside baseball, but the globalists are going down.
[03:00:51.218 --> 03:00:52.839]  So you can say, well, Elon Musk is an opportunist.
[03:00:53.200 --> 03:00:53.940]  He knows they're going down.
[03:00:53.960 --> 03:00:54.541]  He's joining us.
[03:00:54.621 --> 03:00:55.061]  Well, great.
[03:00:55.201 --> 03:00:55.701]  Come on over.
[03:00:56.082 --> 03:00:57.082]  Or he's humanitarian.
[03:00:57.823 --> 03:01:01.606]  When I said that, he tweeted that Thursday with Tucker Carlson and said, this is important.
[03:01:02.705 --> 03:01:09.412]  So, Christ said you judge a tree by its fruits, and Elon is developing amazing fruit right now.
[03:01:09.452 --> 03:01:16.078]  In the four minutes we have left, Robert Barnes, Elon Musk, his position right now, I think he's almost more important than Trump right now.
[03:01:16.138 --> 03:01:19.882]  He is really doing an amazing job, and I can't lie, it's just true.
[03:01:21.840 --> 03:01:38.195]  Yeah, to have a billionaire using truth and using Twitter, now X, to basically share a lot of populist humanitarian messages is a massive red pill and white pill for the American and global populace.
[03:01:38.215 --> 03:01:38.495]  That's right.
[03:01:38.515 --> 03:01:40.396]  The results are incontrovertible.
[03:01:40.657 --> 03:01:41.417]  He's doing good.
[03:01:41.457 --> 03:01:42.258]  You can't lie.
[03:01:42.318 --> 03:01:44.560]  You can say he's not perfect, but my God, he's devastating them.
[03:01:45.361 --> 03:01:47.983]  Well, he's increasingly the anti-Bill Gates.
[03:01:49.923 --> 03:02:04.249]  Bill Gates's obsession is a control grid that will shrink the population and constantly monitor, surveil, and govern our behaviors using big food, big pharma, and big tech to attain and achieve that objectives.
[03:02:04.909 --> 03:02:07.950]  If you look at Elon, Elon's a guy who loves humanity.
[03:02:08.130 --> 03:02:09.711]  He has a bunch of kids himself.
[03:02:09.851 --> 03:02:16.814]  He thinks that the problem is the world is not having enough children and that consequently that has led him to want to limit
[03:02:17.583 --> 03:02:26.976]  How open AI is used to make it a slave to humanity, not a slave of humanity, not to enslave humanity.
[03:02:27.897 --> 03:02:33.025]  Similar with his questioning of other aspects of the illegal immigration.
[03:02:33.625 --> 03:02:38.669]  And it would be great to see him start to welcome criticism of Big Farm and Big Food as well.
[03:02:39.169 --> 03:02:41.911]  A case like the Amos Miller Amish Farmer case.
[03:02:42.211 --> 03:02:46.013]  I think he could give a big boost to those kind of issues too.
[03:02:46.233 --> 03:02:51.237]  His lawsuit against Elon Musk over OpenAI is one of the most underrated things he's done.
[03:02:51.637 --> 03:02:56.040]  Because this is the attempt by Bill Gates to monopolize the world.
[03:02:56.847 --> 03:03:03.712]  And the main person standing in his way directly on the OpenAI lawsuit is Elon Musk.
[03:03:04.152 --> 03:03:11.537]  Just like the only one standing in the way of the WEF and their control of big tech and big media is also Elon Musk.
[03:03:12.137 --> 03:03:13.758]  And they're trying to make him pay a price.
[03:03:13.798 --> 03:03:17.421]  They're trying to steal all of his stocks and those Delaware companies.
[03:03:17.741 --> 03:03:20.923]  They're trying to... They're trying to delist him on the App Store.
[03:03:22.653 --> 03:03:23.014]  Exactly.
[03:03:23.034 --> 03:03:29.540]  They're trying to criminally prosecute him in the Biden administration.
[03:03:29.600 --> 03:03:30.961]  That's why he met with Trump.
[03:03:31.262 --> 03:03:35.406]  He wants to make sure that Trump understands what some of these issues are.
[03:03:35.446 --> 03:03:39.610]  There's another example where Trump could make a win-win situation.
[03:03:40.130 --> 03:03:46.513]  Call out the Biden administration for trying to put Elon Musk in prison for simply being an independent free mind.
[03:03:46.893 --> 03:03:50.114]  Call out the Biden administration's lawfare against Elon Musk.
[03:03:50.574 --> 03:03:56.216]  No one man has been a bigger victim of lawfare of the Biden administration and the Democrats than Donald Trump.
[03:03:56.637 --> 03:03:59.198]  But right up on that list would be Elon Musk.
[03:03:59.658 --> 03:04:03.879]  I mean, just like they're trying to... The same law firm that sued me for Sandy Hook suing Elon Musk.
[03:04:04.880 --> 03:04:05.720]  That's exactly right.
[03:04:05.760 --> 03:04:07.621]  By the way, that was a big wake-up call for him.
[03:04:08.959 --> 03:04:09.800]  Oh, I'm sure it was.
[03:04:10.901 --> 03:04:12.482]  There's been constant wake-up calls.
[03:04:12.582 --> 03:04:29.715]  I think COVID woke up a lot of people, and it will continue to wake up a lot of people, and it's just on us collectively to continue to keep them on the wake-up path, and don't go back to the pre-COVID mindset that pretends Bill Gates is a hero and not a villain.
[03:04:29.996 --> 03:04:31.217]  All right, stay there, Barnes.
[03:04:31.297 --> 03:04:32.278]  I know you gotta go.
[03:04:32.458 --> 03:04:33.218]  One-minute break.
[03:04:33.338 --> 03:04:34.239]  We joined some stations.
[03:04:34.659 --> 03:04:35.580]  I gotta do five more.
[03:04:37.458 --> 03:04:39.101]  You know, the great Gerald Slipknot is okay with that.
[03:04:39.221 --> 03:04:43.088]  I want to finish up on Elon Musk because, folks, he's delivering.
[03:04:43.509 --> 03:04:45.272]  You cannot argue with what he's doing.
[03:04:45.813 --> 03:04:47.376]  He is devastating the globals.
[03:04:47.416 --> 03:04:49.780]  Back in 60 seconds, final comments from Robert Barnes.
[03:04:49.800 --> 03:04:50.141]  Stay with us.
[03:04:59.266 --> 03:05:02.387]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:05:02.407 --> 03:05:03.968]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:05:04.708 --> 03:05:07.749]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:05:07.769 --> 03:05:12.591]  But when we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers...
[03:05:14.028 --> 03:05:16.729]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:05:17.569 --> 03:05:25.393]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:05:26.393 --> 03:05:29.274]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:05:30.035 --> 03:05:34.977]  And I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:05:35.817 --> 03:05:36.737]  I know you spread the word.
[03:05:36.757 --> 03:05:38.258]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[03:05:38.278 --> 03:05:38.818]  Keep doing it.
[03:05:38.858 --> 03:05:47.140]  But most viewers and listeners never go to infowarstore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keeping us on air.
[03:05:47.780 --> 03:05:51.441]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at infowarstore.com.
[03:05:52.101 --> 03:05:56.703]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to infowarstore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:05:57.043 --> 03:05:57.803]  Please take action now.
[03:06:08.890 --> 03:06:09.550]  Big Brother.
[03:06:10.010 --> 03:06:11.251]  Mainstream media.
[03:06:11.811 --> 03:06:12.951]  Government cover-ups.
[03:06:13.692 --> 03:06:15.172]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:06:15.412 --> 03:06:16.553]  Well, so does he.
[03:06:17.073 --> 03:06:21.815]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:22.375 --> 03:06:26.797]  Alright, we're talking Elon Musk, and folks, I've been offered all the big power jobs by the globalists.
[03:06:27.277 --> 03:06:28.537]  I don't want to be with the establishment.
[03:06:28.557 --> 03:06:29.418]  I don't want to sell out.
[03:06:31.002 --> 03:06:33.844]  But Elon Musk is doing irrevocable damage.
[03:06:34.345 --> 03:06:35.666]  I track it.
[03:06:35.686 --> 03:06:38.187]  300 million views a day, conservatively.
[03:06:39.208 --> 03:06:40.929]  Devastating the New World Order.
[03:06:41.550 --> 03:06:44.352]  So, who he was before, what does he do later?
[03:06:44.372 --> 03:06:46.053]  If he does something bad later, I'll attack him.
[03:06:46.334 --> 03:06:47.915]  Just like we criticized Trump last hour.
[03:06:48.055 --> 03:06:48.835]  We're not in a cult here.
[03:06:49.196 --> 03:06:51.898]  But, Barnes, how does someone not get behind Musk?
[03:06:52.418 --> 03:06:54.600]  I mean, he realizes humanity's rising.
[03:06:56.015 --> 03:06:57.520]  He wants a bigger human population.
[03:06:57.861 --> 03:06:59.125]  He's against the globalist agenda.
[03:06:59.166 --> 03:07:01.152]  How does someone not back Musk right now?
[03:07:01.192 --> 03:07:02.637]  I mean, you're an idiot if you don't.
[03:07:03.752 --> 03:07:08.655]  Yeah, I think it's people that are caught up in questions about things from five, six years ago.
[03:07:09.016 --> 03:07:10.417]  I mean, I had doubts about Musk.
[03:07:10.457 --> 03:07:11.617]  I didn't know who he was.
[03:07:11.657 --> 03:07:15.400]  I didn't know what his political beliefs were, you know, and all the rest.
[03:07:15.440 --> 03:07:17.481]  But he's proven it over the last year.
[03:07:17.501 --> 03:07:23.606]  I mean, he's made X a truly... Irrevocable damage to the enemy.
[03:07:24.466 --> 03:07:27.969]  He's bigger than Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones combined.
[03:07:27.989 --> 03:07:29.510]  I mean, it's irrevocable.
[03:07:29.550 --> 03:07:31.151]  You don't do that if you're with them.
[03:07:32.469 --> 03:07:33.150]  Exactly.
[03:07:33.952 --> 03:07:35.675]  And he's calling them out by name.
[03:07:36.115 --> 03:07:37.437]  Calling them out by topic.
[03:07:38.439 --> 03:07:41.083]  He has repeatedly exposed George Soros.
[03:07:41.424 --> 03:07:43.788]  Repeatedly exposed Bill Gates.
[03:07:44.289 --> 03:07:49.293]  He's now suing Bill Gates to stop Bill Gates from taking over AI.
[03:07:50.093 --> 03:07:51.274]  Exposing Disney.
[03:07:51.714 --> 03:07:53.075]  Exposing Bob Iger.
[03:07:53.516 --> 03:07:55.497]  Exposing the woke cultural revolution.
[03:07:55.817 --> 03:07:58.319]  Exposing Jeffrey Epstein.
[03:07:58.699 --> 03:08:00.200]  Exposing the open borders.
[03:08:00.280 --> 03:08:00.921]  My God!
[03:08:01.361 --> 03:08:02.302]  It's happened.
[03:08:02.362 --> 03:08:03.202]  It's going on.
[03:08:03.262 --> 03:08:04.663]  Why are we not celebrating?
[03:08:06.145 --> 03:08:06.625]  Exactly.
[03:08:06.885 --> 03:08:09.487]  Because people aren't ready to win, Robert.
[03:08:11.018 --> 03:08:12.480]  They're not ready to win.
[03:08:12.520 --> 03:08:14.663]  They don't realize how popular freedom is.
[03:08:15.024 --> 03:08:15.604]  It's everything.
[03:08:15.785 --> 03:08:17.106]  Like Trump, he's not perfect.
[03:08:17.467 --> 03:08:18.148]  Elon's not perfect.
[03:08:18.168 --> 03:08:18.689]  They're with us.
[03:08:19.690 --> 03:08:20.651]  Joe Rogan's not perfect.
[03:08:20.731 --> 03:08:21.072]  I'm not.
[03:08:21.713 --> 03:08:22.734]  Neither is Russell Brand.
[03:08:23.295 --> 03:08:24.036]  We're winning!
[03:08:24.336 --> 03:08:25.398]  Aren't they ready for it?
[03:08:25.418 --> 03:08:26.479]  I mean, God, people!
[03:08:28.399 --> 03:08:36.322]  Yeah, and I think people sometimes trick themselves that something is too good to be real, so that maybe it's a double secret opposition plan.
[03:08:36.782 --> 03:08:38.403]  The proof is in the pudding.
[03:08:38.563 --> 03:08:40.104]  I mean, same with Vivek.
[03:08:40.384 --> 03:08:52.709]  I mean, Vivek's a guy I wasn't sure about to begin with, but then he started coming out with very specific plans to take apart the... And they came out against him, because we have to be ready when we win, because we're promoting freedom, which is sexy.
[03:08:53.809 --> 03:08:57.431]  I liken it to selling ice water with lemon in the Sahara versus sand.
[03:08:57.852 --> 03:09:03.255]  We're promoting ice water with lemon in the Sahara for free versus paying for sand.
[03:09:03.535 --> 03:09:04.976]  We're going to win, people!
[03:09:05.196 --> 03:09:07.277]  Evil isn't all powerful!
[03:09:07.338 --> 03:09:09.879]  Get ready for victory, dammit!
[03:09:10.840 --> 03:09:11.400]  I'm going to shut up.
[03:09:11.540 --> 03:09:12.701]  Two-minute closing comment.
[03:09:14.164 --> 03:09:26.551]  Yeah, I mean, we have a unique opportunity to seize, and it is up to us, collectively, the American people, and people of freedom lovers around the world, to make that reality a reality for us, and our posterity.
[03:09:27.111 --> 03:09:42.279]  And some of that involves criticizing our allies, when we can improve them, when they can improve, when they can do better, when they can be better, whether that's Robert Kennedy, or Donald Trump, or Elon Musk, or anyone else, but it also means celebrating and welcoming them.
[03:09:42.779 --> 03:09:44.560]  It's done from a perspective of love.
[03:09:45.900 --> 03:09:46.520]  Absolutely.
[03:09:47.701 --> 03:09:48.501]  And we've proven it.
[03:09:49.061 --> 03:09:53.823]  We've stood by it when other people, when everybody else in the Republican Party was abandoning Donald Trump.
[03:09:53.883 --> 03:09:56.084]  We were there when everything was getting censored.
[03:09:56.104 --> 03:09:57.064]  We're all getting sued.
[03:09:57.084 --> 03:09:57.965]  We're being debanked.
[03:09:58.345 --> 03:10:00.125]  We are the OGs, which we're not bragging.
[03:10:00.205 --> 03:10:00.586]  It's true.
[03:10:01.586 --> 03:10:04.467]  And when we endorse something, folks, it's because it means something.
[03:10:05.760 --> 03:10:06.240]  Exactly.
[03:10:07.101 --> 03:10:10.102]  And how often have we been wrong compared to the institutional media?
[03:10:10.462 --> 03:10:11.783]  I mean, how often have we been right?
[03:10:12.143 --> 03:10:17.706]  I mean, when mistakes were being made by Trump during the early lockdown stage, we were the people calling him out.
[03:10:18.206 --> 03:10:19.206]  And we were right.
[03:10:19.406 --> 03:10:23.809]  And had Trump taken our advice, read the insider's advice, he would still have been president.
[03:10:24.149 --> 03:10:25.589]  And a lot of those things wouldn't have happened.
[03:10:25.930 --> 03:10:28.791]  So we have a track record of when we
[03:10:29.011 --> 03:10:31.713]  Yeah, Musk recognizes we're the Oracles.
[03:10:31.733 --> 03:10:34.354]  Because we're the talk show hosts that talk to the people.
[03:10:34.795 --> 03:10:36.055]  We're real brokers.
[03:10:36.095 --> 03:10:36.916]  We want freedom.
[03:10:37.356 --> 03:10:40.718]  So that's a magic moment, isn't it?
[03:10:40.778 --> 03:10:41.319]  Absolutely.
[03:10:41.599 --> 03:10:50.524]  I mean, Elon Musk made available the platform for you to come back, and it has exploded the interest in you and in InfoWars.
[03:10:50.804 --> 03:10:53.626]  So this is a guy who keeps proving it over and over and over again.
[03:10:53.946 --> 03:10:57.748]  So that means if he has our back, we should have his back.
[03:10:59.530 --> 03:11:00.050]  Exactly.
[03:11:00.070 --> 03:11:07.856]  You can't ask him to take on the New World Order and devastate them and then be pussies and say, oh, he's not pure.
[03:11:08.237 --> 03:11:09.818]  Christ said, I hate these Pharisees.
[03:11:09.898 --> 03:11:10.699]  I want to see action.
[03:11:12.040 --> 03:11:12.480]  Exactly.
[03:11:12.640 --> 03:11:13.641]  And he's proven it now.
[03:11:13.801 --> 03:11:14.222]  For years.
[03:11:14.242 --> 03:11:16.063]  For the last two years, he's proven it.
[03:11:16.283 --> 03:11:17.184]  And he's taken the arrows.
[03:11:17.464 --> 03:11:22.188]  They're trying to take away his Tesla company with illicit lawfare in Delaware.
[03:11:22.228 --> 03:11:24.610]  The EU is trying to criminally indict him.
[03:11:24.650 --> 03:11:28.053]  They got six FEC Commission investigations.
[03:11:29.722 --> 03:11:35.524]  Exactly, and I'm sure the Biden administration has more, trying to find every accessor angle.
[03:11:35.784 --> 03:11:36.665]  Well, listen to what happens.
[03:11:36.825 --> 03:11:41.967]  God comes along and gives us victory, and then people can't believe God gives us victory and just reject it.
[03:11:43.407 --> 03:11:43.947]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:11:44.288 --> 03:11:53.371]  And it's a natural temptation when you've been up against the odds for as long as freedom lovers and liberty lovers have, ever since the deep state seized power.
[03:11:53.411 --> 03:11:56.632]  Exactly, it's a minion victim mentality, folks.
[03:11:57.052 --> 03:11:58.533]  People say, I'm some globalist.
[03:11:59.096 --> 03:12:00.598]  I'll go, hey, my uncle was in Iran.
[03:12:00.618 --> 03:12:01.840]  Contra was corrupt and bad.
[03:12:01.880 --> 03:12:03.041]  He exposed it before he died.
[03:12:03.482 --> 03:12:04.363]  Oh, look, you're with him.
[03:12:04.423 --> 03:12:05.925]  No, my uncle exposed it.
[03:12:05.985 --> 03:12:06.706]  It's the opposite.
[03:12:08.188 --> 03:12:08.769]  Oh, exactly.
[03:12:08.789 --> 03:12:10.351]  I mean, the and we've proven it.
[03:12:10.591 --> 03:12:11.993]  I mean, like the ego.
[03:12:12.173 --> 03:12:17.180]  So how do we expect people to come over to us to win if we treat them like shit once they do?
[03:12:18.542 --> 03:12:18.982]  Exactly.
[03:12:19.002 --> 03:12:20.043]  That's what you can't do.
[03:12:20.683 --> 03:12:27.027]  You gotta operate with the same reciprocal loyalty old kinship networks operated with.
[03:12:27.287 --> 03:12:31.349]  There's a reason why... There's a reason the British couldn't beat the Scots.
[03:12:31.729 --> 03:12:33.170]  They could beat everybody but they had kinship.
[03:12:34.298 --> 03:12:34.718]  Exactly.
[03:12:35.499 --> 03:12:41.743]  The East Tennessee, where I'm from, you know, those old kinship networks work because it kept people alive for centuries.
[03:12:42.043 --> 03:12:43.023]  And what's key to that?
[03:12:43.424 --> 03:12:44.644]  Reciprocal loyalty.
[03:12:44.924 --> 03:13:03.236]  So when we get allies like the Elon Musk, like the Donald Trumps, like the Robert Kennedys, then that's where we have their back, while at the same time where they could be weak, where they have a vulnerability, where they need to be stronger, we call them out so that they can strengthen and get better and improve ourselves and our movement.
[03:13:03.256 --> 03:13:03.976]  Exactly.
[03:13:04.116 --> 03:13:06.758]  The evil is not the only power, people.
[03:13:07.098 --> 03:13:08.579]  We are winning.
[03:13:08.679 --> 03:13:09.900]  Be ready for it.
[03:13:10.161 --> 03:13:11.261]  It'll be one hell of a fight.
[03:13:11.562 --> 03:13:13.663]  Robert Barnes, one more time, we will find your amazing show.
[03:13:15.064 --> 03:13:19.628]  They can find everything at VivaBarnesLaw.Locals.com.
[03:13:20.048 --> 03:13:21.009]  Barnes, I love you, man.
[03:13:21.029 --> 03:13:22.190]  You've been so dead on, brother.
[03:13:22.230 --> 03:13:22.570]  Thank you.
[03:13:23.771 --> 03:13:24.351]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[03:13:25.292 --> 03:13:26.333]  Come back soon to Austin.
[03:13:26.353 --> 03:13:26.873]  Let's go out.
[03:13:27.474 --> 03:13:28.574]  Let's go out and get a steak dinner.
[03:13:28.614 --> 03:13:30.456]  Let's go out on the boat.
[03:13:30.516 --> 03:13:31.677]  Let's go shoot fireworks, brother.
[03:13:32.694 --> 03:13:33.074]  Sounds good.
[03:13:33.995 --> 03:13:39.320]  Alright, the great Prince Forecaster, he's amazing, Gerald Solente.
[03:13:39.641 --> 03:13:49.110]  My best part of my job is knowing these men and women who are so real, who are so common people like I do, who are not controllable, and who cannot be bought.
[03:13:49.650 --> 03:13:55.195]  The best part of my job is I get to know the best people like Gerald Solente and Robert Barnes.
[03:13:56.056 --> 03:13:56.916]  It is such a pleasure.
[03:13:56.936 --> 03:14:00.837]  We'll learn about a minute of this, and we'll fade it down and bring in Gerald.
[03:14:01.237 --> 03:14:03.318]  We'll skip the next network break so he gets his time back.
[03:14:04.098 --> 03:14:05.819]  But I wanted to play this.
[03:14:05.939 --> 03:14:07.559]  It's a magic moment, folks.
[03:14:08.159 --> 03:14:10.000]  We're in a magic moment.
[03:14:10.460 --> 03:14:12.641]  And stop thinking evil's all powerful.
[03:14:13.361 --> 03:14:14.281]  That's a lie.
[03:14:14.841 --> 03:14:18.202]  Good is way more powerful, and it's happening.
[03:14:18.382 --> 03:14:19.122]  Here's the clip.
[03:14:19.483 --> 03:14:20.343]  We'll go to Gerald Cilente.
[03:14:25.971 --> 03:14:44.257]  So different and so new, wasn't like any other Until I kissed you, and then it happened It took me by surprise, I knew that you felt the same
[03:15:07.578 --> 03:15:14.721]  Great being on the Alex Jones Show, and I appreciate everything that Alex says and does, and thank you for the compliments.
[03:15:15.601 --> 03:15:17.482]  And I appreciate everything the staff does.
[03:15:17.662 --> 03:15:19.923]  They work very hard to give you the best that they can do.
[03:15:19.943 --> 03:15:24.425]  This Monday live, you know, the New World Takeover, what's going on in New York?
[03:15:25.745 --> 03:15:25.946]  Ha!
[03:15:26.406 --> 03:15:31.688]  New York City, they got the National Guard and the police in the subways.
[03:15:33.302 --> 03:15:42.464]  What a disgrace, these guys in a military drag with these, you know, stuff that could blow your brains out in five seconds, going through your luggage and stuff.
[03:15:42.584 --> 03:15:44.185]  This is ridiculous.
[03:15:44.605 --> 03:15:47.086]  Oh, this is America, freedom and democracy.
[03:15:47.526 --> 03:15:47.886]  Oh, yeah.
[03:15:48.666 --> 03:15:48.846]  Yeah.
[03:15:48.886 --> 03:15:50.967]  How about the Soviet Union?
[03:15:51.007 --> 03:15:52.047]  That would have been perfect.
[03:15:52.607 --> 03:15:53.927]  And look at the subways.
[03:15:55.108 --> 03:15:56.408]  Look what they look like.
[03:15:56.448 --> 03:15:57.808]  It's a night in Calcutta.
[03:15:59.949 --> 03:16:00.989]  It's disgusting.
[03:16:01.690 --> 03:16:07.872]  The rail system in this world, we're in this country is third world rail.
[03:16:09.353 --> 03:16:10.513]  Freedom is lost.
[03:16:10.973 --> 03:16:20.176]  And not one, not one peep from the little prostitutes, the media whores that get paid to put out by their corporate pimps and government whoremasters.
[03:16:20.756 --> 03:16:22.257]  Oh, this crime problem.
[03:16:23.337 --> 03:16:30.880]  It didn't exist before little lowlife pieces of scum locked down the country to fight the COVID war.
[03:16:31.644 --> 03:16:33.385]  Yeah, you forgot about that, huh?
[03:16:34.626 --> 03:16:39.208]  As I said, when all this happened, when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[03:16:39.648 --> 03:16:40.528]  And they've lost it.
[03:16:42.549 --> 03:16:45.391]  Before I go on, I want to go on to the economy, because it's very important.
[03:16:47.532 --> 03:16:50.213]  You're looking at trends journals, top trends for 2023.
[03:16:50.353 --> 03:16:51.094]  Excuse me, for 2024 or 2023.
[03:16:51.194 --> 03:16:51.874]  Well, look at 2024.
[03:16:51.934 --> 03:16:52.534]  Golden year for gold.
[03:16:52.574 --> 03:16:52.634]  Yep.
[03:17:01.786 --> 03:17:05.709]  When we forecast this, gold was around $2,000 an ounce.
[03:17:06.890 --> 03:17:13.474]  Now, as we go to on air, $2,180.
[03:17:13.794 --> 03:17:19.658]  As it peaked, ain't even close.
[03:17:21.460 --> 03:17:22.260]  Here's the deal.
[03:17:22.280 --> 03:17:27.904]  Again, tracking trends is the understanding of where we are, how we got here, and where we're going.
[03:17:29.825 --> 03:17:30.546]  How we got here.
[03:17:32.509 --> 03:17:34.250]  Again, going back to the COVID war.
[03:17:36.410 --> 03:17:46.493]  Countries all over the world pumped in trillions and trillions of dollars worth of fake money backed by nothing and printed on nothing.
[03:17:47.073 --> 03:17:51.535]  Zero and negative interest rates to artificially prop up the economy.
[03:17:54.936 --> 03:17:55.636]  I was wrong.
[03:17:56.499 --> 03:17:59.207]  When the COVID war began and they locked down everything.
[03:17:59.688 --> 03:18:04.903]  And I just want to go over some of the little clown boys and girls that pushed us through.
[03:18:07.833 --> 03:18:10.354]  How about that DeWine over there in Ohio?
[03:18:10.874 --> 03:18:11.955]  Witless Whitmer.
[03:18:12.415 --> 03:18:13.876]  Arrogant Gavin Newsom.
[03:18:13.916 --> 03:18:16.637]  Don't you know who my daddy is, that arrogant boy?
[03:18:17.137 --> 03:18:19.298]  My daddy worked for the Getty Gang.
[03:18:19.338 --> 03:18:20.259]  He was a lawyer.
[03:18:20.539 --> 03:18:21.559]  You're a nobody.
[03:18:22.080 --> 03:18:23.500]  I'm Andy Cuomo.
[03:18:23.781 --> 03:18:25.361]  My daddy was Mario.
[03:18:25.541 --> 03:18:28.723]  We're gonna rename the Tappan Zee Bridge after my daddy.
[03:18:29.903 --> 03:18:31.744]  You forgot to put the M in there.
[03:18:32.224 --> 03:18:33.845]  It's Mario M. Cuomo.
[03:18:33.905 --> 03:18:35.226]  Rip down all them signs.
[03:18:37.094 --> 03:18:43.120]  I'm locking down everything and I don't want more than 10 people to gather in your home.
[03:18:44.221 --> 03:18:48.064]  And you got people dying in nursing homes, dying in hospitals.
[03:18:48.525 --> 03:18:50.247]  You can't see them!
[03:18:50.267 --> 03:18:52.649]  Heil Hitler!
[03:18:53.510 --> 03:18:53.870]  Got it?
[03:18:56.853 --> 03:18:58.554]  That's who's running our country.
[03:18:59.275 --> 03:19:00.236]  I'm disgusted.
[03:19:00.825 --> 03:19:02.186]  I'm a political atheist.
[03:19:02.846 --> 03:19:05.348]  I am disgusted with both political parties.
[03:19:05.368 --> 03:19:06.829]  I have nothing to do with either of them.
[03:19:08.730 --> 03:19:12.132]  And as for RFK Jr., I was a total supporter of his.
[03:19:12.152 --> 03:19:19.197]  I had Denis Kucinich up at my Occupy Peace rally in May, when Kucinich was his campaign manager.
[03:19:19.717 --> 03:19:27.062]  And what he says about the Palestinians being spoiled people and his support for Israeli genocide, I'm totally opposed to it.
[03:19:27.362 --> 03:19:28.303]  I want to make it clear.
[03:19:28.763 --> 03:19:30.324]  And I'm on the same page with Trump.
[03:19:30.936 --> 03:19:33.978]  So again, Alex, you know, I've said this to Alex, say what you want.
[03:19:33.998 --> 03:19:37.120]  You know, so I'm just saying I'm up for any of them.
[03:19:37.961 --> 03:19:39.582]  So now let's go back to the economy.
[03:19:39.962 --> 03:19:41.383]  Again, all things are connected.
[03:19:43.024 --> 03:19:45.445]  They artificially, I thought everything would crash.
[03:19:45.705 --> 03:19:57.573]  They didn't teach me in Economics 101 at graduate school about all this stupid crap that they did to artificially prop up the economy with fake money.
[03:19:59.614 --> 03:20:00.375]  The facts are there.
[03:20:01.004 --> 03:20:02.305]  For all to read and see.
[03:20:03.045 --> 03:20:04.706]  Again, we wrote about it in detail.
[03:20:05.226 --> 03:20:05.426]  Here.
[03:20:06.486 --> 03:20:07.507]  They called it a war.
[03:20:07.787 --> 03:20:08.167]  You ready?
[03:20:10.828 --> 03:20:11.889]  March 18th, 2020.
[03:20:12.789 --> 03:20:13.409]  Donald Trump.
[03:20:13.529 --> 03:20:14.190]  It's a war.
[03:20:14.210 --> 03:20:18.571]  I view it as, in a sense, a wartime president.
[03:20:19.812 --> 03:20:23.513]  You see, when they call something a war, everybody marches off to war.
[03:20:24.174 --> 03:20:26.535]  Just as 88% of the Americans looked up
[03:20:30.509 --> 03:20:39.957]  To a guy with a pecker about this size and a pair of cojones smaller than a mothball, George W. Bush.
[03:20:40.417 --> 03:20:43.159]  We're going to get that guy Osama bin Laden dead or alive.
[03:20:43.540 --> 03:20:45.101]  Another daddy's boy.
[03:20:45.121 --> 03:20:48.984]  Another little boy born on third base and thought he had a home run.
[03:20:49.244 --> 03:20:51.006]  A little...
[03:20:53.749 --> 03:21:02.152]  They march off to war when they call it a war and all the ignorant people that did it and all the ones that got the jab hated you for not getting it.
[03:21:02.592 --> 03:21:02.912]  Already?
[03:21:02.992 --> 03:21:03.693]  That was Trump.
[03:21:03.893 --> 03:21:04.773]  We keep going on.
[03:21:05.553 --> 03:21:06.454]  How about Biden?
[03:21:08.735 --> 03:21:09.815]  This is a crisis.
[03:21:10.455 --> 03:21:12.036]  We're at war with a virus.
[03:21:13.576 --> 03:21:15.257]  March 14th, 2020.
[03:21:15.917 --> 03:21:16.938]  Four days before Trump.
[03:21:18.018 --> 03:21:19.679]  Little Andy Cuomo.
[03:21:20.139 --> 03:21:21.279]  Arrogant Andy Cuomo.
[03:21:21.299 --> 03:21:21.499]  Hey!
[03:21:23.916 --> 03:21:25.917]  Abuse any girls lately?
[03:21:29.158 --> 03:21:34.521]  The soldiers in this fight are our healthcare professionals.
[03:21:34.841 --> 03:21:36.181]  Healthcare professionals?
[03:21:36.741 --> 03:21:38.342]  You got that little clown!
[03:21:38.822 --> 03:21:43.064]  I got my things cut off and I don't know if I'm a girl or a boy!
[03:21:43.704 --> 03:21:45.925]  Little Rachel Richard Levine?
[03:21:46.246 --> 03:21:48.206]  His, her, he, me, she, it?
[03:21:48.607 --> 03:21:51.808]  Telling me, telling me about
[03:21:53.177 --> 03:21:54.177]  Health professionals?
[03:21:54.738 --> 03:22:06.383]  How about all those little clowns out there, all over the world, putting these little jerks, there he is, he, she, it, he, she, it, a piece of S-H-I, yep.
[03:22:08.084 --> 03:22:10.985]  These are the people telling us what to do!
[03:22:12.966 --> 03:22:14.687]  One clown after another!
[03:22:14.707 --> 03:22:19.649]  Oh, they had a guy up in Canada, you know, with his head on backwards?
[03:22:21.115 --> 03:22:23.036]  How about the other one up in Canada?
[03:22:23.236 --> 03:22:24.317]  Don't have sex.
[03:22:24.617 --> 03:22:25.717]  Don't have sex.
[03:22:26.258 --> 03:22:27.078]  I never do.
[03:22:27.178 --> 03:22:28.159]  Why should you?
[03:22:30.340 --> 03:22:34.702]  And because, I don't want to criticize Alex Jones, but he called these guys a bunch of pussies.
[03:22:35.262 --> 03:22:37.043]  You're using that word disrespectfully.
[03:22:37.063 --> 03:22:40.345]  There's a positive way for that word.
[03:22:41.285 --> 03:22:41.665]  I like.
[03:22:42.486 --> 03:22:43.386]  I know, Rachel.
[03:22:43.486 --> 03:22:45.507]  You know, Richard Rachel.
[03:22:46.328 --> 03:22:46.668]  Anyway.
[03:22:48.357 --> 03:22:50.118]  Another arrogant little boy.
[03:22:50.138 --> 03:22:51.798]  A little boy of nothing.
[03:22:54.419 --> 03:22:56.239]  Mayor Bill de Blasio.
[03:22:57.580 --> 03:22:59.720]  Warren Wilhelm Jr.?!
[03:23:00.481 --> 03:23:04.942]  I changed my name to get the Italian-American vote?!
[03:23:05.482 --> 03:23:07.223]  I am a piece of scum!
[03:23:07.683 --> 03:23:11.204]  I've been sucking off the public tit all my life!
[03:23:11.764 --> 03:23:13.505]  I will tell you what to do!
[03:23:13.525 --> 03:23:14.425]  You ready?
[03:23:20.302 --> 03:23:25.044]  We have to understand, this is pure war footing.
[03:23:25.064 --> 03:23:27.646]  Oh, Cuomo went on.
[03:23:28.406 --> 03:23:33.669]  It's the people who are waiting in the hospital, they are the soldiers who are fighting this battle for us.
[03:23:34.589 --> 03:23:44.714]  Oh, that little cut-zone Macron, with the little fake hair, and I don't know if he's a he or a she, an it or a they, but considering the guy he brought in as Prime Minister, I think it's a he-she.
[03:23:45.334 --> 03:23:45.975]  Or she-it.
[03:23:46.775 --> 03:23:48.716]  Or... take a...
[03:23:50.379 --> 03:23:53.540]  He's Shiite and don't know what it is.
[03:23:56.542 --> 03:23:57.562]  We are at war.
[03:23:58.122 --> 03:24:03.065]  The enemy is invisible and it requires our general mobilization.
[03:24:03.085 --> 03:24:04.765]  There he is with his little fake hair.
[03:24:04.785 --> 03:24:06.306]  Look at that little fake hair.
[03:24:06.326 --> 03:24:09.427]  Look at that little fake girl boy.
[03:24:09.707 --> 03:24:13.249]  A little girl boy who wants to ramp up the Ukraine war.
[03:24:13.669 --> 03:24:14.189]  That's right.
[03:24:16.710 --> 03:24:18.051]  We're cowards, he said.
[03:24:18.962 --> 03:24:19.722]  If we don't do it.
[03:24:19.942 --> 03:24:20.562]  Oh, cowards?
[03:24:20.963 --> 03:24:21.583]  Hey, little boy!
[03:24:22.383 --> 03:24:30.905]  Everybody that supports the Ukraine war, the Israel war, put on your military drag, go fight, or shut your mouth.
[03:24:32.606 --> 03:24:35.227]  These little boys couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag.
[03:24:35.767 --> 03:24:39.728]  As I said, little Lindsey, did you come out of the closet yet, Graham?
[03:24:40.048 --> 03:24:42.229]  They don't make a paper bag big enough.
[03:24:43.969 --> 03:24:44.990]  Arrogant, arrogant.
[03:24:45.150 --> 03:24:46.410]  So, you ready?
[03:24:47.239 --> 03:25:02.927]  Another piece of stupid garbage crap that the best cartoonist in the world could not make a more clown-looking figure than Boris Johnson, former Prime Minister of the UK, and put an F and a C in that one too.
[03:25:04.528 --> 03:25:04.808]  Ready?
[03:25:06.449 --> 03:25:14.513]  We must act like any wartime government and do whatever it takes to support our economy.
[03:25:15.073 --> 03:25:15.373]  Alright?
[03:25:15.893 --> 03:25:16.834]  I'm not making this up.
[03:25:18.359 --> 03:25:18.959]  Look at this guy.
[03:25:20.040 --> 03:25:20.660]  Look at this guy.
[03:25:21.521 --> 03:25:28.584]  How can you be so stupid to swallow the crap spewing out of this clown's mouth?
[03:25:30.185 --> 03:25:33.926]  Yeah, the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus went out of business.
[03:25:34.247 --> 03:25:36.828]  You don't have to step right up and pay to see the clown.
[03:25:37.288 --> 03:25:38.929]  They're in a country near you.
[03:25:40.470 --> 03:25:41.370]  Politicians.
[03:25:45.292 --> 03:25:45.432]  Yep.
[03:25:46.479 --> 03:25:48.661]  Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in.
[03:25:49.381 --> 03:25:51.022]  The entire country has entered.
[03:25:51.042 --> 03:25:53.544]  No, that's not it.
[03:25:53.604 --> 03:25:56.767]  Hold it.
[03:25:56.847 --> 03:25:58.988]  President Xi in China.
[03:26:00.109 --> 03:26:01.950]  And they launched the COVID war.
[03:26:04.132 --> 03:26:10.297]  He launched the COVID war in China on Chinese Lunar New Year, the year of the rat in 2020.
[03:26:10.737 --> 03:26:13.299]  Three years of zero COVID policy.
[03:26:13.599 --> 03:26:15.020]  That's destroyed its economy.
[03:26:16.226 --> 03:26:17.746]  And again, we're going back to gold.
[03:26:18.687 --> 03:26:19.947]  This all has to do with it.
[03:26:21.827 --> 03:26:23.047]  It's a people's war.
[03:26:23.447 --> 03:26:23.627]  Yep.
[03:26:26.308 --> 03:26:26.548]  U.S.
[03:26:26.608 --> 03:26:30.249]  Secretary Matt Hancock.
[03:26:32.089 --> 03:26:35.410]  We are at war against an invisible killer.
[03:26:36.230 --> 03:26:38.651]  And we will have to do everything we can to stop it.
[03:26:40.371 --> 03:26:44.572]  World Health Organization Director, I don't know, Theodosios
[03:26:46.294 --> 03:26:48.535]  Bah, bah, bah, bah, I love you Jesus, I love you Jesus.
[03:26:49.115 --> 03:26:53.516]  Quote, we're at war with a virus that threatens to tear us apart.
[03:26:58.678 --> 03:27:02.679]  Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary General.
[03:27:04.139 --> 03:27:04.860]  UN Secretary.
[03:27:05.680 --> 03:27:08.261]  Quote, we are at war with a virus and not winning it.
[03:27:09.401 --> 03:27:11.682]  This war needs a wartime plan to fight it.
[03:27:12.102 --> 03:27:12.462]  Got it?
[03:27:15.863 --> 03:27:16.103]  Date?
[03:27:16.966 --> 03:27:18.007]  Going back to gold.
[03:27:20.849 --> 03:27:23.271]  Gold prices should be much higher than they are.
[03:27:24.793 --> 03:27:26.914]  The Chinese are buying record amounts.
[03:27:27.495 --> 03:27:28.776]  This is just the beginning.
[03:27:28.816 --> 03:27:35.982]  They're going to lower interest rates to keep the crime syndicate in place that's running the country now, because Ms.
[03:27:36.042 --> 03:27:45.150]  Fatshah Brut, Janet Yellen, the Fed head, now our Treasury Secretary,
[03:27:46.463 --> 03:27:48.225]  Shows you who's running the country.
[03:27:48.525 --> 03:27:48.926]  That's right.
[03:27:49.326 --> 03:28:01.218]  The former Fed head, now our Treasury Secretary, they're going to do everything they can to pump this economy up, artificially, to keep the people in power in power.
[03:28:02.960 --> 03:28:06.683]  In the Clinton campaign, behind the scenes, back in 1992, it's the economy, stupid.
[03:28:08.891 --> 03:28:10.793]  That's what the people are concerned about the most.
[03:28:11.274 --> 03:28:16.240]  So the lower they lower interest rates, the lower the dollar falls, the higher gold prices go.
[03:28:16.780 --> 03:28:18.322]  That's one of your top trends.
[03:28:18.682 --> 03:28:19.363]  There she is, Ms.
[03:28:19.383 --> 03:28:20.104]  Fatshah Brut.
[03:28:20.324 --> 03:28:21.185]  We're the same age.
[03:28:21.265 --> 03:28:21.926]  Marona me.
[03:28:22.166 --> 03:28:23.248]  Hope I don't look like her.
[03:28:27.119 --> 03:28:28.961]  Imagine these people telling us what to do.
[03:28:29.341 --> 03:28:30.622]  How stupid can you be?
[03:28:31.102 --> 03:28:33.384]  And that's why you listen to InfoWars.
[03:28:34.846 --> 03:28:37.408]  They had an article up here last week I'm going to talk about.
[03:28:38.008 --> 03:28:39.310]  Support InfoWars.
[03:28:39.350 --> 03:28:40.410]  They're supporting you.
[03:28:40.951 --> 03:28:42.232]  Do everything you can.
[03:28:42.973 --> 03:28:43.793]  Everything you can.
[03:28:46.155 --> 03:28:48.898]  Because we are at a very critical time.
[03:28:54.102 --> 03:28:54.743]  We must unite.
[03:28:57.145 --> 03:29:00.667]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[03:29:01.068 --> 03:29:08.072]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of, is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[03:29:08.252 --> 03:29:10.254]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[03:29:10.454 --> 03:29:11.494]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[03:29:11.514 --> 03:29:12.235]  He loved the idea.
[03:29:12.575 --> 03:29:16.078]  What would you call the debates and discussions about a pro-human future?
[03:29:16.118 --> 03:29:16.978]  Just Team Humanity?
[03:29:17.038 --> 03:29:17.939]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[03:29:18.079 --> 03:29:18.519]  Absolutely.
[03:29:18.840 --> 03:29:20.241]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[03:29:20.301 --> 03:29:23.803]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[03:29:23.983 --> 03:29:31.449]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to keep InfoWars on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[03:29:31.689 --> 03:29:35.752]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand
[03:29:36.192 --> 03:29:43.398]  That this is a revolution against the globalists, and it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[03:29:43.698 --> 03:29:45.019]  We're told humans are the problem.
[03:29:45.039 --> 03:29:46.020]  We're told we're killing the Earth.
[03:29:46.320 --> 03:29:50.583]  We're told all this garbage so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[03:29:50.883 --> 03:29:51.584]  We're not going to do that.
[03:29:51.844 --> 03:29:56.468]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at mfulmorestore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[03:29:57.347 --> 03:30:06.890]  Unless you've been living under a rock, you've heard how amazing turmeric is for inflammation for your joints, your bones, your blood, your organs, your mind, everything.
[03:30:07.350 --> 03:30:12.072]  Well, we have Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula with 95% curcuminoid extract.
[03:30:12.512 --> 03:30:14.994]  No one that we know of has it even above 85%.
[03:30:15.894 --> 03:30:23.660]  This is the strongest formula on the market, and it's way lower priced than some of the top brands out there that are 75%, 80% humanoid.
[03:30:24.140 --> 03:30:26.922]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is amazing.
[03:30:27.182 --> 03:30:28.423]  You're missing out if you don't try it.
[03:30:28.723 --> 03:30:32.906]  It's discounted right now, 40% off at InfoWarsTore.com, and it funds the InfoWar.

[03:30:34.547 --> 03:30:36.388]  You owe it to yourself to try Body's.
[03:30:36.668 --> 03:30:37.509]  I know you'll be amazed.
[03:30:37.789 --> 03:30:38.770]  Get yours right now.
[03:30:39.190 --> 03:30:40.410]  We're good to go.
[03:30:57.082 --> 03:30:59.365]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[03:30:59.525 --> 03:30:59.885]  Thank you.
[03:31:00.066 --> 03:31:02.629]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[03:31:02.689 --> 03:31:03.950]  I started taking that stuff.
[03:31:03.990 --> 03:31:07.194]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[03:31:07.314 --> 03:31:08.215]  When did you start taking that?
[03:31:08.496 --> 03:31:12.420]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[03:31:13.081 --> 03:31:15.782]  And I started eating a little better, but my blood pressure stayed high.
[03:31:15.802 --> 03:31:23.326]  And when I took the X2 iodine, after about two or four weeks, I think my body was detoxified of a bunch of metals and stuff that my body was storing.
[03:31:23.446 --> 03:31:25.647]  And my blood pressure came down to the perfect level.
[03:31:26.027 --> 03:31:28.969]  And I tell people the only thing I did was X2 iodine.
[03:31:29.429 --> 03:31:43.301]  And even though I do think all your other products are good, I recommend to anybody that they start with X2 Iodine because it detoxifies your body and kind of kicks your natural DNA into full force.
[03:31:43.402 --> 03:31:46.845]  So, in my life, I found X2 Iodine to be best.
[03:31:47.325 --> 03:31:50.928]  I tried other iodines and they didn't have the same effect.
[03:31:51.088 --> 03:31:53.390]  So, X2 Iodine, I really wanted to point that out.
[03:31:57.261 --> 03:31:58.521]  But it all boils down to this.
[03:31:58.921 --> 03:32:02.022]  We're bringing you hardcore information on the New World Order.
[03:32:02.342 --> 03:32:06.064]  We told you about lockdowns and poison shots that would attack your immune system decades before.
[03:32:06.084 --> 03:32:08.084]  We exposed Bohemian Grove first.
[03:32:08.144 --> 03:32:10.145]  We exposed 9-11 before it happened.
[03:32:10.465 --> 03:32:14.126]  I am in the zeitgeist, but I cannot continue to fight the globals without your support.
[03:32:14.446 --> 03:32:18.729]  So spread this report, spread this video, and get great products you need at the same time.
[03:32:19.089 --> 03:32:20.950]  Funding our operation at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:32:21.251 --> 03:32:23.832]  Right now, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.

[03:32:33.659 --> 03:32:36.201]  Dr. Minkovich says it's one of the best compounds and formulas out there.
[03:32:36.641 --> 03:32:37.421]  It is amazing.
[03:32:37.501 --> 03:32:38.202]  Nitric Boost.
[03:32:38.862 --> 03:32:40.223]  We have Turbo Force.
[03:32:40.243 --> 03:32:40.924]  10-hour clean energy.

[03:32:44.906 --> 03:32:45.447]  Discounted.
[03:32:46.347 --> 03:32:48.109]  It's at InfoWarStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:32:48.129 --> 03:32:48.189]  888-253-3139.
[03:32:48.249 --> 03:32:49.089]  InfoWarStore.com.
[03:32:49.109 --> 03:32:53.272]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:19.762 --> 03:33:21.363]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:21.683 --> 03:33:30.806]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilente.
[03:33:33.287 --> 03:33:35.347]  Hey, everybody, Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:35.367 --> 03:33:38.668]  Again, do everything you can to support InfoWars.

[03:33:44.090 --> 03:33:45.991]  And this is really an important time for this.
[03:33:46.949 --> 03:33:51.151]  Because we have to get in the best shape we can, physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
[03:33:51.531 --> 03:33:53.732]  We are in the fight for our lives.
[03:33:55.853 --> 03:34:01.195]  So you go to InfoWarsStore.com and you get this bodies that's now back in stock.

[03:34:11.259 --> 03:34:15.841]  And it's one of the most studied ingredients, you know, known to man and womankind.
[03:34:16.613 --> 03:34:18.674]  So get this BODYS.
[03:34:18.754 --> 03:34:27.358]  It helps your joint support, your mobility support, flexibility support, inflammation support, and of course, InfoWars support.

[03:34:45.757 --> 03:34:46.477]  And you get more.
[03:34:47.697 --> 03:35:00.700]  So, I was talking about how they destroyed the global economy with shutting down the world to fight the COVID war and why gold prices are going to go up.
[03:35:01.360 --> 03:35:06.801]  Because the world is indebted with debt.
[03:35:08.742 --> 03:35:10.562]  The bubble is going to burst.
[03:35:11.403 --> 03:35:14.725]  There's only so much they can do to artificially prop it up.
[03:35:15.105 --> 03:35:18.067]  And again, it's all in your trends journal.
[03:35:18.427 --> 03:35:22.050]  I said the trifecta of our top trends.
[03:35:22.350 --> 03:35:23.490]  These are just three of them.
[03:35:23.871 --> 03:35:26.212]  Again, the first one I mentioned is gold.
[03:35:27.613 --> 03:35:28.674]  Golden year for gold 2024.
[03:35:29.174 --> 03:35:34.857]  Another one is World War 3.
[03:35:36.478 --> 03:35:37.499]  And we're going to get into that.
[03:35:39.687 --> 03:35:45.129]  And the other one is EVs go FU.
[03:35:46.510 --> 03:35:48.331]  You see how the EV sales are way down?
[03:35:48.951 --> 03:35:59.175]  We have been saying this is not an alternative since they became popular a decade ago with the facts that are in your Trends Journal.
[03:35:59.215 --> 03:36:03.457]  Matter of fact, you know, I was talking about Elon Musk and I think he's doing a great job.
[03:36:04.238 --> 03:36:07.419]  And I saw Elon Musk has a shirt, Occupy Mars.
[03:36:08.263 --> 03:36:11.706]  It'd be great if he also, you know, occupied peace.
[03:36:12.566 --> 03:36:13.807]  We have to occupy peace.
[03:36:14.368 --> 03:36:18.270]  Because World War I has been... World War III, excuse me, has begun.
[03:36:19.211 --> 03:36:20.852]  And you don't have to believe me.
[03:36:21.533 --> 03:36:33.101]  All you have to do is you have to believe the comments coming from a little clown boy over there in Poland.
[03:36:33.882 --> 03:36:36.544]  The guy, Turk, saying that
[03:36:37.165 --> 03:36:38.746]  The era of peace is over.
[03:36:40.367 --> 03:36:44.850]  And that... Yeah, not making this up.
[03:36:46.471 --> 03:36:49.173]  Again, a little boy of nothing.
[03:36:49.873 --> 03:36:52.015]  A little boy of nothing.
[03:36:52.635 --> 03:36:59.720]  All these little... Oh, and I don't... You want to join the military, knock yourself out.
[03:37:01.261 --> 03:37:06.222]  I'm a believer in George Washington's farewell address, no foreign entanglements.
[03:37:06.282 --> 03:37:09.523]  I've read the, yeah, without going into a whole lot of details.
[03:37:10.103 --> 03:37:14.485]  It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world.
[03:37:14.945 --> 03:37:16.925]  Observe good faith and justice toward all nations.
[03:37:16.985 --> 03:37:18.466]  Cultivate peace and harmony with all.
[03:37:18.766 --> 03:37:23.387]  The nation which indulges toward another in habitual hatred or in habitual fineness is to some degree a slave.
[03:37:23.447 --> 03:37:23.707]  Alright?
[03:37:24.727 --> 03:37:27.408]  So save your crap, shove it!
[03:37:28.228 --> 03:37:32.772]  You're being disrespectful to the founding fathers or your little clown war mongerers.
[03:37:33.232 --> 03:37:37.736]  So this little clown boy, a little boy, another little nothing, another little nothing.
[03:37:39.377 --> 03:37:43.461]  Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk.
[03:37:45.983 --> 03:37:46.323]  You ready?
[03:37:47.784 --> 03:37:49.826]  The times for peace are over.
[03:37:49.846 --> 03:37:51.828]  Hey.
[03:37:53.389 --> 03:37:54.110]  Hey, Donnie boy.
[03:37:54.130 --> 03:37:56.592]  How about F.U.? ?
[03:37:58.183 --> 03:38:01.144]  Who are you talking to?
[03:38:01.164 --> 03:38:01.364]  Hey!
[03:38:01.544 --> 03:38:02.244]  Salenti!
[03:38:02.304 --> 03:38:03.345]  Get him locked up!
[03:38:04.425 --> 03:38:06.386]  I'M THE PRIME MINISTER!
[03:38:08.306 --> 03:38:10.007]  I'M A LITTLE SLIME BALL!
[03:38:13.408 --> 03:38:15.009]  I'LL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO!
[03:38:17.490 --> 03:38:21.691]  The post-war era is over.
[03:38:23.592 --> 03:38:26.893]  We are living through new times.
[03:38:28.624 --> 03:38:31.346]  The pre-war era.
[03:38:32.726 --> 03:38:36.949]  Again, your top trends for 2024.
[03:38:37.870 --> 03:38:39.571]  World War III.
[03:38:40.291 --> 03:38:43.113]  It's coming out of the mouths of the clowns.
[03:38:45.234 --> 03:38:48.516]  And you go to JonesTrends.com.
[03:38:49.296 --> 03:38:50.777]  JonesTrends.com.
[03:38:52.058 --> 03:38:53.799]  You get a break on the Trends Journal.
[03:38:54.179 --> 03:38:54.579]  It's less than $2.50.
[03:38:54.619 --> 03:38:55.440]  It's about $2.50 a week.
[03:38:58.419 --> 03:38:59.280]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:38:59.600 --> 03:39:00.340]  This is the wall.
[03:39:00.400 --> 03:39:02.021]  I can't say the right word.
[03:39:02.321 --> 03:39:03.082]  It's not street.
[03:39:03.122 --> 03:39:07.784]  It begins with an S and an H and it ends with a T. You got an I thrown in there.
[03:39:08.164 --> 03:39:08.585]  Journal.
[03:39:09.105 --> 03:39:10.085]  This is the front page.
[03:39:10.185 --> 03:39:10.826]  Five dollars.
[03:39:11.166 --> 03:39:11.846]  Five dollars.
[03:39:12.347 --> 03:39:13.407]  Five dollars for this.
[03:39:14.868 --> 03:39:18.570]  A star clicks with fans on the Oscars red carpet.
[03:39:18.790 --> 03:39:19.450]  Hey, hey.
[03:39:20.191 --> 03:39:21.672]  Clowns run in this thing.
[03:39:22.472 --> 03:39:24.593]  I'm buying it because I need economic data.
[03:39:25.954 --> 03:39:27.695]  Screw you, economic data.
[03:39:28.283 --> 03:39:30.324]  Oh, the woman running the show now?
[03:39:30.625 --> 03:39:32.046]  We're going to give the people what they want.
[03:39:32.366 --> 03:39:32.926]  That's her say.
[03:39:33.106 --> 03:39:34.247]  What do you mean what they want?
[03:39:35.968 --> 03:39:38.070]  So you're getting what you can't get anywhere else.
[03:39:38.510 --> 03:39:41.992]  And again, it would be a great magazine for Elon Musk to support.
[03:39:42.373 --> 03:39:46.756]  Because there's no magazine in the world that comes closer to Trends Journal.
[03:39:47.176 --> 03:39:49.417]  If you could find one, let me know.
[03:39:49.818 --> 03:39:51.579]  Over 170 pages a week.
[03:39:52.039 --> 03:39:53.000]  Yeah, you read what you want.
[03:39:53.570 --> 03:40:07.976]  From high-tech science, technocracy, Joe Duran, the guy, one of his books, you get this on Amazon, Be Human, this guy writes about technocracy, whole section on AI.
[03:40:08.576 --> 03:40:13.398]  Again, economics, geopolitics, we're giving you what everybody, you're not getting anywhere else.
[03:40:13.438 --> 03:40:15.479]  So, World War III has begun.
[03:40:15.819 --> 03:40:22.002]  He goes on, the fight against totalitarian trends, corruption, and lies
[03:40:22.475 --> 03:40:24.356]  Is taking place on many fronts.
[03:40:24.776 --> 03:40:25.017]  Hey!
[03:40:26.678 --> 03:40:28.199]  A little clown boy.
[03:40:29.740 --> 03:40:30.500]  A little clown boy.
[03:40:30.880 --> 03:40:32.381]  You talking about your government?
[03:40:33.302 --> 03:40:35.143]  The totalitarian corruption?
[03:40:35.563 --> 03:40:37.885]  Or maybe you're talking about Ukraine.
[03:40:38.425 --> 03:40:44.949]  The most corrupt country in the Europe according to... No, no, not me.
[03:40:45.429 --> 03:40:46.930]  According to the European Union.
[03:40:48.191 --> 03:40:48.591]  Oh, oh!
[03:40:49.031 --> 03:40:49.912]  A Tusk clown.
[03:40:50.672 --> 03:40:51.253]  How about...
[03:40:54.804 --> 03:41:07.878]  89% of the Ukrainian people say corruption is the major complaint other than the terrible war going on.
[03:41:09.525 --> 03:41:16.347]  So this little clown shooting out this crap, and this is what's being reported, and you're not allowed to say anything against it.
[03:41:16.507 --> 03:41:19.768]  That's why you go to Infowars, and that's why you get to Transjournal.
[03:41:20.268 --> 03:41:21.988]  We give you the facts of what's going on.
[03:41:22.329 --> 03:41:27.990]  Tells you what's next, and how to prepare, prevail, and prosper in these very dangerous times ahead.
[03:41:28.610 --> 03:41:29.170]  He goes on.
[03:41:32.851 --> 03:41:38.373]  The most dramatic illustration of this, what is happening in the war in Ukraine.
[03:41:38.991 --> 03:41:40.652]  We are facing a simple choice.
[03:41:41.172 --> 03:41:41.932]  A simpleton.
[03:41:42.453 --> 03:41:43.313]  Who you talking to?
[03:41:44.594 --> 03:41:46.735]  Either we fight to protect our borders.
[03:41:46.775 --> 03:41:47.255]  Wait a minute.
[03:41:47.675 --> 03:41:51.257]  Russia's not affecting your border.
[03:41:51.557 --> 03:41:52.597]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[03:41:53.338 --> 03:41:54.178]  Either we fight.
[03:41:55.539 --> 03:41:57.000]  What you mean, um, we?
[03:41:59.481 --> 03:42:00.081]  Go fight.
[03:42:00.721 --> 03:42:02.382]  Go fight or shut your mouth.
[03:42:03.403 --> 03:42:03.603]  No.
[03:42:04.683 --> 03:42:06.284]  I am a politician.
[03:42:07.220 --> 03:42:09.981]  I use the word we all the time.
[03:42:10.321 --> 03:42:15.082]  It only means you, the plantation workers of Slavelandia.
[03:42:19.623 --> 03:42:30.666]  Either we fight to protect our borders, territory, and values, and defend our citizens and future generations, or accept the alternative that is defeat.
[03:42:33.666 --> 03:42:35.727]  And then that other little slime ball,
[03:42:36.491 --> 03:42:54.585]  Another little arrogant slimeball that NATO Secretary General John Stoltenberg said last month that the U.S.
[03:42:55.766 --> 03:43:02.651]  and NATO should brace, quote, for a confrontation that could last decades.
[03:43:04.753 --> 03:43:05.193]  Isn't that nice?
[03:43:07.950 --> 03:43:11.112]  And again, you go to your Trends Journal.
[03:43:12.393 --> 03:43:12.774]  Here it is.
[03:43:12.794 --> 03:43:12.774]  2014.
[03:43:15.115 --> 03:43:17.297]  See how happy that guy is?
[03:43:18.278 --> 03:43:25.483]  America's overthrow of the democratically elected government of Viktor Yanukovych, brought to you by Victoria Nuland, who's no longer there.
[03:43:25.783 --> 03:43:26.884]  All the facts are here.
[03:43:27.405 --> 03:43:29.786]  Oh, and the deal between Gorbachev and Bush Sr.
[03:43:30.287 --> 03:43:32.809]  that, quote, NATO would move one inch further.
[03:43:33.109 --> 03:43:37.352]  Oh, you're talking about little scum tusks?
[03:43:37.827 --> 03:43:54.620]  You're talking about, uh, about, um, either we fight to protect our borders and territory, the deal made that NATO would not move one inch further, and it was 16 NATO countries back then, and now there were 32.
[03:44:00.424 --> 03:44:02.786]  And again, World War III's begun.
[03:44:04.417 --> 03:44:06.798]  You got that other little clown boy I was talking about.
[03:44:06.818 --> 03:44:08.678]  Where did you find this article over here?
[03:44:11.679 --> 03:44:11.779]  Ah!
[03:44:12.539 --> 03:44:18.780]  French Defense Group sets up in Ukraine to bolster front line.
[03:44:18.800 --> 03:44:19.420]  Isn't that nice?
[03:44:20.601 --> 03:44:21.821]  Oh, that's from the Financial Times.
[03:44:23.481 --> 03:44:24.701]  So they got troops on the ground.
[03:44:26.742 --> 03:44:26.882]  Yep.
[03:44:33.683 --> 03:44:37.064]  Three French companies will be setting up partnerships with Ukraine companies.
[03:44:37.204 --> 03:44:37.564]  Oh, yeah.
[03:44:38.164 --> 03:44:40.705]  Oh, we had that other arrogant, arrogant murderer!
[03:44:41.045 --> 03:44:41.545]  Murderer!
[03:44:43.166 --> 03:44:44.927]  I was a former general in Iraq.
[03:44:45.047 --> 03:44:47.047]  I slaughtered a lot of people there.
[03:44:47.067 --> 03:44:48.908]  Did so in Afghanistan, too.
[03:44:49.268 --> 03:44:50.968]  And now I'm the defense secretary.
[03:44:52.249 --> 03:44:53.029]  Lloyd Austin.
[03:44:56.890 --> 03:45:02.012]  Whose new job, before he came as defense secretary, sat on the board of directors
[03:45:02.902 --> 03:45:31.282]  Raytheon, the second largest defense contractor, in your Trends Journal, this week, or last week's Trends Journal, the new one comes out tomorrow, bragging, bragging, that the billions and hundreds of billions of dollars, the trillions of dollars we're spending on the military-industrial complex, as our country's rotting in front of our eyes, with over 63% of the people living paycheck to paycheck, as 38%
[03:45:33.021 --> 03:45:34.542]  A people's income is going toward rent.
[03:45:36.042 --> 03:45:36.542]  Bragging!
[03:45:38.043 --> 03:45:43.304]  Yeah, it's creating jobs for the military-industrial complex.
[03:45:48.546 --> 03:45:54.948]  It's a disgrace in front of everyone's eyes for all to see.
[03:45:57.129 --> 03:46:02.491]  And I was looking at, I read, I didn't watch, I couldn't watch it,
[03:46:02.864 --> 03:46:04.165]  Trump's, uh, Trump.
[03:46:04.325 --> 03:46:06.686]  Biden's State of the Union.
[03:46:06.726 --> 03:46:07.366]  What union?
[03:46:08.287 --> 03:46:11.488]  State of the, State of Slave-landia.
[03:46:12.469 --> 03:46:14.910]  And again, I'm totally against the two party system.
[03:46:15.210 --> 03:46:23.354]  How many, how many hundreds of years has two parties been running the democracy of America and all these billionaires giving money?
[03:46:24.435 --> 03:46:26.216]  Look at the stupid crap here.
[03:46:26.956 --> 03:46:32.059]  This, this was the toilet paper record, the New York slime.
[03:46:35.540 --> 03:46:46.447]  Thursday, with Nikki Haley, with Haley's exit, election rematch begins in earnest.
[03:46:50.269 --> 03:46:54.632]  Page after page, not making this up.
[03:46:54.812 --> 03:46:55.673]  You can't make it up.
[03:46:56.493 --> 03:46:57.534]  It's so disgusting.
[03:46:58.454 --> 03:47:03.337]  Page after page of little Nikki Haley and losing this thing.
[03:47:03.357 --> 03:47:04.198]  Where is it over here?
[03:47:04.952 --> 03:47:08.475]  Yeah, there it is.
[03:47:08.635 --> 03:47:08.835]  Yeah.
[03:47:09.596 --> 03:47:09.936]  Look at this.
[03:47:11.397 --> 03:47:12.078]  Two pages.
[03:47:12.878 --> 03:47:13.019]  A!
[03:47:14.300 --> 03:47:15.360]  A New York slime!
[03:47:16.421 --> 03:47:17.022]  She lost!
[03:47:17.102 --> 03:47:18.683]  Why are you telling me all this crap?
[03:47:19.284 --> 03:47:22.486]  Oh, and by the way, you knew she was gonna lose in the beginning.
[03:47:23.187 --> 03:47:26.089]  What, about a hundred million dollars go into her campaign?
[03:47:31.594 --> 03:47:34.336]  How about putting a hundred million dollars into Occupy Peace?
[03:47:35.219 --> 03:47:36.380]  Go to hell, Solenti!
[03:47:38.541 --> 03:47:39.602]  So going back to B.S.
[03:47:40.642 --> 03:47:54.110]  Biden's speech, not since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault here and at home as they are today.
[03:47:54.130 --> 03:47:58.673]  Oh, hey Biden, freedom and democracy?
[03:47:59.333 --> 03:48:00.534]  You're the guy that said
[03:48:01.488 --> 03:48:06.129]  We got to hire a person to stop this misinformation.
[03:48:07.449 --> 03:48:09.770]  But remember the person that we're going to put in there?
[03:48:10.670 --> 03:48:11.950]  Remember the clown lady?
[03:48:13.490 --> 03:48:14.411]  Oh, there's the Biden.
[03:48:14.451 --> 03:48:16.351]  No jab, no job, no jab.
[03:48:16.991 --> 03:48:17.451]  Oh, excuse me.
[03:48:17.491 --> 03:48:18.391]  No jab, no job.
[03:48:20.192 --> 03:48:23.833]  There's the Biden that imposed one restriction after another on us.
[03:48:25.333 --> 03:48:26.833]  Talking about freedom and democracy.
[03:48:28.073 --> 03:48:28.293]  Yeah.
[03:48:30.214 --> 03:48:30.654]  He goes on.
[03:48:32.042 --> 03:48:35.603]  What makes our moment rare is that freedom and democracy are under attack.
[03:48:35.623 --> 03:48:35.883]  Yeah.
[03:48:37.224 --> 03:48:38.104]  All over the country.
[03:48:39.865 --> 03:48:40.745]  All over the country.
[03:48:48.787 --> 03:48:54.789]  Overseas, he goes right into, right into that, into World War III.
[03:48:55.309 --> 03:48:55.650]  You ready?
[03:48:56.110 --> 03:48:57.010]  Get right here.
[03:48:58.711 --> 03:48:59.871]  Not since President Lincoln.
[03:49:01.414 --> 03:49:06.175]  In a civil war, freedom and democracy have been under assault, here and at home, as they are today.
[03:49:06.835 --> 03:49:13.817]  What makes our movement rare is that freedom and democracy are under attack, both at home and overseas, at the very same time.
[03:49:14.177 --> 03:49:25.701]  And he immediately goes into overseas, Putin of Russia is on the march, invading Ukraine and sowing chaos throughout Europe and beyond.
[03:49:26.161 --> 03:49:28.801]  He ain't sowing chaos beyond Europe and beyond.
[03:49:29.222 --> 03:49:30.482]  This is between Ukraine
[03:49:32.210 --> 03:49:37.072]  And Russia, that's been going on for a couple of hundred years.
[03:49:37.612 --> 03:49:37.952]  Got it?
[03:49:40.373 --> 03:49:41.373]  This is nothing new.
[03:49:43.594 --> 03:49:44.514]  But that's the lie.
[03:49:48.236 --> 03:49:49.436]  If anybody, you ready?
[03:49:49.476 --> 03:49:50.717]  This is the best one yet.
[03:49:51.457 --> 03:49:54.778]  If anybody in this room, okay, let's stop there.
[03:49:54.818 --> 03:49:57.459]  If anybody in this room, you mean
[03:49:58.462 --> 03:50:06.227]  A room full of arrogant, stupid, ignorant, gutless clowns, narcissistic freaks?
[03:50:07.048 --> 03:50:07.828]  That room?
[03:50:08.389 --> 03:50:10.150]  Hey, hey, got some!
[03:50:10.910 --> 03:50:23.959]  How about, how about saying that if anybody in America
[03:50:26.946 --> 03:50:27.907]  How about we the people?
[03:50:28.227 --> 03:50:29.708]  Screw you, Salenti!
[03:50:30.389 --> 03:50:31.290]  You're nobody!
[03:50:32.591 --> 03:50:33.792]  I'm Biden.
[03:50:35.253 --> 03:50:42.179]  I'm three and a half years older than you, got five draft deferments, loved every ward, supported every one of them.
[03:50:42.719 --> 03:50:46.362]  I've been sucking off the public tit now for over 60 years.
[03:50:47.804 --> 03:50:48.805]  You listen to me.
[03:50:50.766 --> 03:50:55.090]  If anybody in this room thinks Putin will stop at Ukraine, I do.
[03:50:55.939 --> 03:50:56.960]  Oh, I don't count, I forgot.
[03:50:57.940 --> 03:51:02.843]  I assure you, you assure me, you can't walk in a straight line.
[03:51:04.904 --> 03:51:05.584]  He will not.
[03:51:06.144 --> 03:51:07.785]  That is pure propaganda.
[03:51:08.365 --> 03:51:09.346]  Pure propaganda.
[03:51:10.406 --> 03:51:14.689]  Because if you go back, we show that other clown boy, Boris Johnson.
[03:51:15.809 --> 03:51:20.532]  They had made a deal before the, just as the Ukrainian war broke out in Turkey.
[03:51:21.772 --> 03:51:24.994]  They made a deal in Turkey to have a ceasefire.
[03:51:25.595 --> 03:51:27.316]  And Boris Johnson went over there to end it.
[03:51:28.036 --> 03:51:42.785]  So he says, I assure you that it will not, that's because he speaks out of both sides of his mouth, talking about peace and sending more weapons of death to Ukraine and to Israel.
[03:51:46.427 --> 03:51:46.628]  Yep.
[03:51:47.948 --> 03:51:54.012]  But now assistance for Ukraine is being blocked by those who want to walk away
[03:51:54.537 --> 03:51:56.217]  From our leadership of the world.
[03:51:56.777 --> 03:51:58.438]  Leadership of the world?
[03:51:58.918 --> 03:52:00.898]  What are you talking about?
[03:52:01.518 --> 03:52:07.780]  You can't lead the country that's going to crap in front of everybody's eyes!
[03:52:11.620 --> 03:52:12.460]  Leadership.
[03:52:18.222 --> 03:52:20.442]  America is the founding member of NATO.
[03:52:21.383 --> 03:52:24.404]  The Military Alliance of Democratic Nations.
[03:52:25.124 --> 03:52:28.905]  Yeah, I want that guy Qaddafi out of there.
[03:52:29.885 --> 03:52:30.965]  He gotta go.
[03:52:31.986 --> 03:52:33.046]  We're NATO.
[03:52:33.926 --> 03:52:36.367]  Brought to you by Barack Obama.
[03:52:37.747 --> 03:52:45.389]  Little arrogant Cameron, who's back in the UK now playing Foreign Minister, foreign in another world.
[03:52:46.709 --> 03:52:50.110]  Sarkozy of France, a little piece of crap.
[03:52:51.764 --> 03:53:02.768]  And again, the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner, Barack Obama, Hitler-y Clinton, Susan Rice, Samantha Power, Gaddafi has to go!
[03:53:02.848 --> 03:53:04.849]  Hey, we're NATO!
[03:53:06.530 --> 03:53:09.331]  Oh, what you did to Yugoslavia, that was great, too.
[03:53:10.412 --> 03:53:11.452]  What hypocrisy.
[03:53:14.753 --> 03:53:18.155]  I say this to Congress, we must stand up to Putin.
[03:53:18.695 --> 03:53:18.855]  We?
[03:53:20.097 --> 03:53:21.638]  Again, the draft dodger.
[03:53:24.900 --> 03:53:27.721]  Oh, the fifth deferment was because I got asthma.
[03:53:28.322 --> 03:53:30.283]  Oh yeah, but I was a great athlete in college.
[03:53:30.823 --> 03:53:34.225]  Yep.
[03:53:36.306 --> 03:53:39.648]  He goes, my message to Putin is simple.
[03:53:40.248 --> 03:53:41.028]  Of course, it's simple.
[03:53:41.068 --> 03:53:43.230]  I'm a simpleton, so I'm going to make it really simple.
[03:53:45.431 --> 03:53:46.711]  We will not walk away.
[03:53:46.751 --> 03:53:48.392]  You can't walk away in a straight line.
[03:53:48.412 --> 03:53:49.373]  Well, who are you talking about, we?
[03:53:50.305 --> 03:53:51.265]  What are you talking about we?
[03:53:53.426 --> 03:53:54.707]  We will not bow down.
[03:53:54.987 --> 03:53:56.027]  I will not bow down.
[03:53:56.047 --> 03:53:57.848]  Now, wait a minute.
[03:53:58.548 --> 03:54:01.929]  When you're in politics, that's all you do is you bow down to suck your way up.
[03:54:06.131 --> 03:54:08.992]  And again, I was the assistant to the Secretary of the New York State Senate.
[03:54:10.192 --> 03:54:15.454]  I ran major political campaigns, worked on them, didn't run them, worked on them in West Chester County back in the 70s.
[03:54:18.146 --> 03:54:25.769]  Picture me picking up Ronald Reagan at Chicago Hilton, 1976 and 30 years old, number two guy running a major trade association.
[03:54:26.369 --> 03:54:28.350]  I'm putting on a brunch with him and our board of directors.
[03:54:29.551 --> 03:54:32.972]  Two days before he's announcing he's running against Gerald Ford on the ticket.
[03:54:35.153 --> 03:54:35.913]  I don't bow down.
[03:54:36.353 --> 03:54:39.515]  In order to get to the top in politics, you've got to bow down and suck up.
[03:54:42.236 --> 03:54:42.416]  Yep.
[03:54:44.037 --> 03:54:44.977]  Our democracy.
[03:54:45.771 --> 03:54:47.512]  Again, it's a two-party crime syndicate.
[03:54:47.532 --> 03:54:48.392]  I have nothing to do with it.
[03:54:49.653 --> 03:54:53.755]  And then again, he goes on to talk about what's going on in Israel.
[03:54:55.616 --> 03:54:57.177]  And, uh, total disgusting.
[03:54:58.458 --> 03:54:59.418]  Totally opposed to it.
[03:55:00.939 --> 03:55:04.001]  Again, wrote about it in detail.
[03:55:04.021 --> 03:55:07.263]  And he ends it with, May God bless you all.
[03:55:07.483 --> 03:55:08.643]  What God are you talking about?
[03:55:09.744 --> 03:55:12.826]  You say you're a Zionist and a Catholic.
[03:55:13.346 --> 03:55:13.526]  Nope.
[03:55:14.201 --> 03:55:15.642]  Nobody that's a Catholic.
[03:55:15.702 --> 03:55:16.682]  I was raised Catholic.
[03:55:16.702 --> 03:55:18.303]  I don't believe in the church one bit.
[03:55:20.043 --> 03:55:20.904]  It's a disgrace.
[03:55:20.984 --> 03:55:26.966]  Again, they screwed me up, beat me up, broke my eardrum, perforated my middle ear, left me back in the fifth grade.
[03:55:27.426 --> 03:55:30.207]  You know, did terrible things to me.
[03:55:30.708 --> 03:55:32.988]  I'm just thankful Father Foley was a ladies man.
[03:55:33.008 --> 03:55:34.009]  It could have been a lot worse.
[03:55:35.429 --> 03:55:37.010]  And God protect our troops.
[03:55:37.090 --> 03:55:38.291]  What God you're talking about?
[03:55:38.451 --> 03:55:41.752]  Protecting our troops in foreign countries that we have no right being there?
[03:55:44.983 --> 03:55:59.218]  And again, I don't have time, but there was an article that, in InfoWars, don't leave a soul alive, Israeli rabbi calls to genocide Gaza, said Torah demands killing babies.
[03:55:59.638 --> 03:56:01.320]  That's in InfoWars.
[03:56:01.920 --> 03:56:02.801]  So it's not me.
[03:56:03.462 --> 03:56:07.306]  And again, Middle East Monitor has the article in detail.
[03:56:08.584 --> 03:56:11.866]  He described the war waged in Gaza as a religious war.
[03:56:12.466 --> 03:56:14.287]  So, too, did little Lindsey Graham.
[03:56:14.687 --> 03:56:15.467]  I'm an American.
[03:56:15.508 --> 03:56:16.728]  This isn't my religious war.
[03:56:17.108 --> 03:56:18.529]  And get this straight.
[03:56:19.870 --> 03:56:23.251]  I don't believe in your religion.
[03:56:25.633 --> 03:56:29.054]  You don't believe in mine.
[03:56:29.074 --> 03:56:31.936]  I don't tell you what to believe in.
[03:56:32.716 --> 03:56:33.497]  Don't tell me.
[03:56:33.517 --> 03:56:38.239]  I don't believe in your Torah.
[03:56:41.844 --> 03:56:44.065]  I believe in what's going on now.
[03:56:46.827 --> 03:56:53.830]  I am the Deacon of the Universal Church of Freedom, Peace and Justice.
[03:56:58.172 --> 03:57:00.334]  And you can see the sermons that I do each week.
[03:57:01.274 --> 03:57:10.699]  So don't tell me I gotta believe in the 500 religions out there and you gotta tell me I gotta swallow your crap and you can kill who you want.
[03:57:11.514 --> 03:57:12.355]  I'm for peace!
[03:57:13.035 --> 03:57:19.321]  And if we don't have peace on Earth, again, our top trends for 2023 are coming true right in front of your eyes.
[03:57:20.101 --> 03:57:25.106]  That little Katson Macron wants to tell NATO troops to go fight in Ukraine.
[03:57:25.426 --> 03:57:29.269]  I just read to you what that little Tusk boy of nothing said over in Poland.
[03:57:30.830 --> 03:57:32.152]  So support InfoWars.
[03:57:32.872 --> 03:57:34.774]  We're all on the peaceful path.
[03:57:36.195 --> 03:57:39.418]  United we stand, divided we die.
[03:57:40.640 --> 03:57:43.803]  And again, get your Trends Journal, go to jonestrends.com.
[03:57:44.123 --> 03:57:45.364]  History before it happens.
[03:57:47.145 --> 03:57:52.430]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalists, and people can't identify who's a patron and who isn't.
[03:57:52.750 --> 03:57:55.893]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalists.
[03:57:55.953 --> 03:57:58.855]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.

[03:58:46.929 --> 03:58:52.232]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing, high-quality coffee has not been available.
[03:58:52.693 --> 03:58:57.076]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[03:58:57.516 --> 03:58:59.978]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[03:59:00.558 --> 03:59:09.944]  But now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.
[03:59:10.124 --> 03:59:12.706]  It's powered by the company Minuteman Coffee.
[03:59:13.366 --> 03:59:21.409]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best-tasting, best-smelling, strongest coffee that I have ever drank.
[03:59:21.890 --> 03:59:23.290]  It is game-changing.
[03:59:23.730 --> 03:59:25.871]  All you gotta do is buy a bag of it and try it.
