[00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:04.212]  2024.
[00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:04.212]  InfoWars should be shut down by tomorrow evening.
[00:00:04.232 --> 00:00:05.533]  I have major updates.
[00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:12.737]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:26.786]  And it's time for you men to stand up in the InfoWars and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:29.108]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:00:31.294 --> 00:00:36.380]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.403 --> 00:00:45.270]  That's how it all ends.
[00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.171]  God wins.
[00:00:47.493 --> 00:00:51.037]  We shouldn't know all the details of World War II yet, but we're gonna live it right now.
[00:00:54.904 --> 00:00:58.091]  Sunday, June 2nd, 2024.
[00:00:58.131 --> 00:01:01.318]  155 days, 7 hours, 59 minutes, 2 seconds.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.225]  The most important election in world history.
[00:01:05.552 --> 00:01:09.416]  I come to you in the twilight of Impul Wars, as it has been known.
[00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:15.001]  I don't think there's really any way that we'll be around more than a month or two at best.
[00:01:15.662 --> 00:01:19.846]  I can give you all the details and angles, and it would take a long time to go through it all.
[00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:24.010]  But we have major updates here for you.
[00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.511]  We have a raft of huge guests.
[00:01:26.172 --> 00:01:27.954]  Ted Nugent, Mike Adams, Steve Quayle,
[00:01:29.873 --> 00:01:33.276]  Steve Bannon, trying to get Roger on, but I think he's with Trump right now.
[00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:36.478]  So, we've got a lot happening.
[00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.120]  There's also a lot I haven't told you.
[00:01:40.341 --> 00:01:42.202]  The CIA was listening to all of it.
[00:01:43.923 --> 00:01:51.409]  I secretly did advise Trump a lot, and I did send him reports and memos, and I did help him purge the White House repeatedly of the bad guys.
[00:01:51.769 --> 00:01:54.031]  And that Fiona Hill went on TV.
[00:01:55.703 --> 00:01:59.927]  On 60 Minutes and talked about it and cried about it and said, I don't even know who George Soros is.
[00:01:59.947 --> 00:02:03.250]  She was on his board and she said, I don't know what a globalist is.
[00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:05.593]  And she's the main writer at TheGlobalist.com.
[00:02:07.535 --> 00:02:09.497]  So, that's what they call themselves, globalists.
[00:02:09.517 --> 00:02:10.518]  That's where we get the term.
[00:02:10.898 --> 00:02:15.522]  So, the John Birch Society probably has been calling them that for 45 years.
[00:02:16.823 --> 00:02:18.184]  Because they started calling themselves that.
[00:02:18.464 --> 00:02:20.046]  So, that's where we get the term.
[00:02:20.086 --> 00:02:24.149]  They go, oh, there's no globalists, there's no world government, there's no plan for depopulation, but we do want to depopulate you.
[00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:25.610]  We need to get rid of all the humans.
[00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:29.253]  New York Times, Washington Post, looking forward to the end of humanity.
[00:02:30.374 --> 00:02:31.475]  That's what this is all about.
[00:02:31.875 --> 00:02:33.036]  And I can explain the plan.
[00:02:34.188 --> 00:02:40.169]  I think more important than talking about myself a lot, which we need to do just so people know what's going on, but is to really focus on what their endgame is.
[00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:55.472]  For all the stupid people going along with the system, so they can understand what they've been read into, how they've been read into it, I know how they've been read into it, and so they can hear me tell them how they were brought into it, so that they can understand that I know what's going on and I'm right again.
[00:02:56.072 --> 00:02:58.352]  So, here's the deal.
[00:03:01.173 --> 00:03:02.933]  Nugent's on in like 10 minutes, so
[00:03:04.636 --> 00:03:05.797]  I'll just give you a brief summation.
[00:03:06.017 --> 00:03:07.438]  First off, I want to get this out there.
[00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:18.467]  I am heartened and very humbled and very thankful by the incredible, insane outpouring of support by basically everybody that doesn't want to blow the planet up.
[00:03:19.544 --> 00:03:21.005]  It is seismic.
[00:03:21.305 --> 00:03:23.907]  I've talked to hundreds of people that have called me today.
[00:03:23.987 --> 00:03:25.028]  Hundreds have called and sent messages.
[00:03:25.068 --> 00:03:34.394]  I've talked to 50 or so prominent people, you name it, and they just say, this is all emblematic of what's happening to Trump and the rest of the country, and they understand we're in total tyranny.
[00:03:35.935 --> 00:03:45.221]  And it's just accelerating, not just the awakening, but people really realizing how much real trouble we're in, which is good because that's how you then assess a real problem to deal with the full magnitude.
[00:03:45.261 --> 00:03:46.562]  You don't lie to yourself about it.
[00:03:47.358 --> 00:03:47.838]  So there's that.
[00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:53.561]  And I've just been very honored to be here and work with all of you and the crew and all the supporters of the years.
[00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:56.863]  And we've been through a lot together and I've tried to do the best job I could.
[00:03:56.883 --> 00:03:59.904]  You know, in hindsight, I could have done a lot of things different, but it is what it is.
[00:04:00.164 --> 00:04:04.086]  And we've changed the world unlike any other organization other than Trump.
[00:04:04.727 --> 00:04:05.607]  And he's had his problems.
[00:04:05.667 --> 00:04:06.507]  I've had my problems.
[00:04:06.527 --> 00:04:07.288]  And now Elon Musk.
[00:04:09.028 --> 00:04:14.811]  Trump is right there doing way more than I've ever done, just devastating the enemy.
[00:04:14.871 --> 00:04:16.472]  You can all day say, why is he doing it?
[00:04:16.492 --> 00:04:19.093]  I think he says they want to end human civilization.
[00:04:19.693 --> 00:04:22.035]  You can say, well, he's still got a lot of big transhumanist element in it.
[00:04:22.455 --> 00:04:22.695]  Yeah.
[00:04:23.575 --> 00:04:28.418]  But regardless, there's Trump, Elon Musk, and then there's Alex Jones when it comes to fighting the new world order.
[00:04:28.458 --> 00:04:31.299]  And then we see Tucker Carlson doing a great job and Joe Rogan.
[00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:32.140]  It's not a competition.
[00:04:33.917 --> 00:04:37.379]  I have to say that that truthful thing, because that's how the enemy sees it.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.924]  They see me as, what they've described in Time Magazine and Newsweek, as the prophet of the global populist movement.
[00:04:43.944 --> 00:04:48.127]  And that's really what the position God put me in, that the enemy actually said that 10 years ago.
[00:04:48.147 --> 00:04:49.468]  And I was like, oh, that's ridiculous.
[00:04:49.488 --> 00:04:50.148]  That's exaggerating.
[00:04:50.188 --> 00:04:50.849]  No, it's true.
[00:04:52.697 --> 00:04:58.280]  I just want to acknowledge your leadership and your ability to see around corners.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:10.206]  Again and again and again, you have been labeled as a conspiracy theorist and a nutcase for speaking the truth that you were able to perceive earlier than many people.
[00:05:10.966 --> 00:05:18.273]  And I'm in your debt and I think we're all in your debt for your courageous actions over these many years.
[00:05:18.353 --> 00:05:23.898]  You've been vilified and denigrated and gaslit and everything else.
[00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:29.463]  I've received a small taste of what you've been through and I don't like it very much.
[00:05:29.824 --> 00:05:35.229]  So I certainly appreciate and empathize with everything you've been through.
[00:05:36.102 --> 00:05:44.268]  And thank you for being the hero that you are and not backing down in the face of all the crap that's been thrown at you.
[00:06:01.195 --> 00:06:07.179]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.123]  I want to be 100% crystal clarion clear with all of you.
[00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:14.745]  I am extremely honored and blessed to be in this position.
[00:06:24.795 --> 00:06:30.179]  It's been an incredible 30 years on air, 27 years since I bought the domain, Infowars.com, for like $9.
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:36.865]  And I can say I've done the best job I could to fight tyranny.
[00:06:37.085 --> 00:06:39.407]  And I've been an honorable, straightforward man.
[00:06:40.347 --> 00:06:47.493]  I've been completely honest with you that I am a completely straight arrow, except for alcohol and women.
[00:06:48.294 --> 00:06:48.974]  And I guess tobacco.
[00:06:49.495 --> 00:06:49.735]  That's it.
[00:06:51.977 --> 00:06:54.438]  And I've been good, because I'm married, about the woman thing.
[00:06:55.438 --> 00:06:57.879]  Everything else you hear about me is an absolute lie.
[00:06:58.619 --> 00:07:02.460]  I follow truth like I follow the North Star.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.400]  It is my religion.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.021]  God is truth.
[00:07:05.521 --> 00:07:14.964]  And my integrity is absolute to the point of hurting myself in many cases, as people know.
[00:07:16.624 --> 00:07:21.166]  But I just cannot tell a lie.
[00:07:22.321 --> 00:07:23.001]  I make mistakes.
[00:07:24.282 --> 00:07:27.323]  And then I look at our enemies and how they are the complete opposite.
[00:07:28.343 --> 00:07:30.804]  And it is fantastical to see what scum they are.
[00:07:33.686 --> 00:07:35.426]  And we are on the verge of nuclear war.
[00:07:36.587 --> 00:07:38.668]  They have killed 22 million people with the shots and counting.
[00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:51.013]  They are now about to inject the entire beef herd under emergency executive orders with mRNA self-replicating nano prions.
[00:07:51.803 --> 00:07:54.505]  That will give you basically synthetic mad cow disease.
[00:07:55.986 --> 00:08:00.389]  And that's just the part eating your brain, not to mention your liver and your heart and your arteries and everything else.
[00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.211]  Capillaries.
[00:08:03.652 --> 00:08:04.372]  There's big news on that.
[00:08:04.392 --> 00:08:06.074]  I mean, we are in the middle of a total war.
[00:08:06.114 --> 00:08:06.954]  We're all being targeted.
[00:08:06.994 --> 00:08:07.555]  It's a fact.
[00:08:07.615 --> 00:08:14.720]  It's not... I am in great sorrow and great mourning for humanity.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.083]  And I'll be quite honest with you.
[00:08:19.076 --> 00:08:26.778]  When you get older and you've lived, I've always loved humanity, but the continuum of the human experiment and what we are is what matters.
[00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:28.558]  And it's being erased.
[00:08:28.618 --> 00:08:30.098]  We're being overwritten.
[00:08:30.838 --> 00:08:33.839]  The plan is to get rid, publicly, of 90% of the world population.
[00:08:34.219 --> 00:08:36.600]  The globalists are just telling their minions they're going to be kept around.
[00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:37.340]  That's not going to happen.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.881]  There are internal statements and other information I've gotten.
[00:08:41.901 --> 00:08:45.381]  And then there are predictive programming and missions.
[00:08:45.461 --> 00:08:48.662]  They believe they will reduce everything down to one entity.
[00:08:50.492 --> 00:08:56.173]  There'll be finally two entities that face each other in this quest for godhood.
[00:08:56.733 --> 00:08:57.854]  Gods destroy worlds.
[00:08:58.134 --> 00:09:01.694]  Gods kill populations.
[00:09:01.734 --> 00:09:04.975]  Gods are gods because they make the decisions to do that.
[00:09:06.575 --> 00:09:07.796]  Oh yeah, your god Satan.
[00:09:09.016 --> 00:09:10.536]  And of course all of them are betrayed.
[00:09:10.556 --> 00:09:12.697]  There won't be one entity left at the end of this.
[00:09:13.497 --> 00:09:14.017]  Satan will
[00:09:15.498 --> 00:09:15.999]  Kill everything.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.245]  Every animal, every plant, every human, every life form on earth.
[00:09:20.147 --> 00:09:27.301]  But Satan wants the free will action of those he's deceived to carry that out, down to the last betrayal of the last person.
[00:09:30.307 --> 00:09:32.869]  And so that's really the most important message you can get here.
[00:09:32.909 --> 00:09:36.131]  And that's why they don't like me, because I see them, I know them.
[00:09:36.171 --> 00:09:42.575]  I mean, like in Time Magazine and Newsweek, I said 10 years ago, it was like 15 years ago, they said, Alex Jones is the prophet of the Tea Party.
[00:09:43.156 --> 00:09:45.757]  And I'm not saying I'm a prophet, but that's how the enemy sees me.
[00:09:46.258 --> 00:09:48.980]  This is the guy, this is the guy out there stirring it up.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.362]  And I knew they gave me credit for getting Trump elected, and I think our audience did.
[00:09:53.162 --> 00:09:56.004]  But they really do see me after Trump as the number one enemy.
[00:09:56.024 --> 00:09:56.885]  I'm the number two enemy.
[00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:05.604]  And they tried to set me up a bunch and I had this mission-oriented situation where I ignored all the attacks on us.
[00:10:05.664 --> 00:10:11.246]  I would just give you little updates because I understood that those attacks were to try to get me diverted off of message.
[00:10:13.027 --> 00:10:20.489]  But now those attacks that are coming to their conclusion in this theater of war are waking people up.
[00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:23.391]  And they're trying to put me in prison.
[00:10:24.411 --> 00:10:26.732]  So I do need to talk about myself.
[00:10:27.979 --> 00:10:29.960]  And I do need to set the record straight about what's going on.
[00:10:31.001 --> 00:10:33.263]  But just very briefly, I want to thank you all.
[00:10:33.443 --> 00:10:34.423]  We don't want any violence.
[00:10:35.404 --> 00:10:37.765]  The enemy wants violence because they're losing the hearts and minds.
[00:10:37.785 --> 00:10:39.386]  They're losing the control of your soul.
[00:10:39.987 --> 00:10:40.907]  And that's the final goal.
[00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:45.010]  And so no violence to support Infowars.
[00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:45.610]  None of that.
[00:10:45.711 --> 00:10:52.235]  We're in the age and the season and the time of the false flags going into the election with 155 days left.
[00:10:53.295 --> 00:10:54.356]  And that's a no-brainer.
[00:10:54.396 --> 00:10:55.217]  Most people understand that.
[00:10:55.237 --> 00:10:57.038]  But still, there's provocateurs out there, so don't take the bait.
[00:10:58.953 --> 00:10:59.814]  So I want to thank everybody.
[00:10:59.854 --> 00:11:00.735]  I want to tell you I love you.
[00:11:00.795 --> 00:11:01.635]  We're all in this together.
[00:11:02.176 --> 00:11:03.217]  God's real, know that.
[00:11:04.898 --> 00:11:08.981]  And just in very brief summation, people want a quick soundbite.
[00:11:10.122 --> 00:11:27.337]  I learned Friday that they told more guards, the private security company we use, it's bonded and great, does a great job, that they were bringing in more guards to shut us down and lock and change the keys at 9 o'clock.
[00:11:29.059 --> 00:11:31.641]  And so I learned that at like four o'clock.
[00:11:32.741 --> 00:11:42.667]  So I made calls and I explained that the CRO appointed by the court was already slapped down by the judge when he filed a secret filing in March and said, Jones is unreliable.
[00:11:42.707 --> 00:11:43.587]  Jones is stealing money.
[00:11:43.607 --> 00:11:45.308]  I caught him doing this.
[00:11:45.348 --> 00:11:46.009]  None of that was true.
[00:11:46.969 --> 00:11:54.774]  And I need to have full power over this company and the power to fire him because under an LLC in the federal law,
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.003]  You can't have a CRO that makes all the decisions.
[00:11:59.944 --> 00:12:01.026]  They advise the court.
[00:12:01.106 --> 00:12:03.889]  If he doesn't like what I'm doing, he goes to the court.
[00:12:03.969 --> 00:12:04.891]  He's just reporting back.
[00:12:06.573 --> 00:12:07.474]  So that's how that works.
[00:12:09.096 --> 00:12:13.982]  And so I let him thinking, you know, just I'm not going to, you know, try to be obstructionist here.
[00:12:14.042 --> 00:12:14.743]  Just get through this.
[00:12:16.687 --> 00:12:16.887]  I don't
[00:12:37.642 --> 00:12:40.823]  Then he would tell the sales manager, you just keep the money.
[00:12:40.863 --> 00:12:42.884]  And the sales manager goes, hey, I can keep that.
[00:12:42.904 --> 00:12:45.064]  And I go, and my lawyer's like, that can't be right.
[00:12:45.084 --> 00:12:49.846]  So they met with my sales manager and they went and confronted McGill and said, we have to bring this money into here.
[00:12:49.866 --> 00:12:52.667]  Oh, well, I just was, you know.
[00:12:53.407 --> 00:12:56.388]  So then he got caught in that because he was setting me up, I believe.
[00:13:00.734 --> 00:13:07.015]  Follow the report with the court that he caught me doing this, even though we had meetings and lawyers and I don't know, things might have gotten recorded.
[00:13:07.035 --> 00:13:08.415]  I think they did.
[00:13:08.435 --> 00:13:14.537]  And yeah, I've got the thermal nuclear weapons recordings held back.
[00:13:15.397 --> 00:13:19.317]  Because as soon as that happened, as soon as he did that, I was like, this is a setup.
[00:13:19.377 --> 00:13:27.839]  And I saw what was going on and understood that, you know, in my view, and of course, I'm Ryan, he'd been approached and was a setup and he's a big leftist and hid that, doing all this.
[00:13:29.366 --> 00:13:32.007]  And I told him, and I never met with him again, alone.
[00:13:33.028 --> 00:13:37.450]  I said, a few times he'd come in my office and I'd go, bloop, you know, record.
[00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:40.131]  It'd be too loud, I gotta go to the bathroom, I'm gonna get a cup of coffee, bloop.
[00:13:40.911 --> 00:13:41.431]  Come back in.
[00:13:42.452 --> 00:13:47.714]  When he'd saddle up and try it again, he'd get it with Harmon, the sales manager, repeatedly.
[00:13:48.074 --> 00:13:53.116]  And Harmon didn't even understand what was happening, he's like, McGill says I can keep the money, and I'm like, you can't keep your little percent.
[00:13:54.157 --> 00:13:56.338]  No, it has to go to him and he's gotta pay you.
[00:13:58.669 --> 00:14:06.233]  So he then follows this secret report in March, and I haven't talked to him since then, other than one meeting when my CPAs and lawyers were there.
[00:14:06.373 --> 00:14:11.816]  And my CPAs and lawyers got to go to the bathroom, and I said, I'm not going to be alone with him, and I left too.
[00:14:11.836 --> 00:14:13.757]  And I looked at him, and I said, I know you'll make stuff up.
[00:14:14.258 --> 00:14:15.018]  That was like two weeks ago.
[00:14:15.038 --> 00:14:15.638]  I pointed right at him.
[00:14:16.579 --> 00:14:19.160]  And he looked down, and I said, I'm not going to be in the room alone with you, buddy.
[00:14:20.341 --> 00:14:24.023]  And so, that's where we are.
[00:14:25.464 --> 00:14:33.888]  And so I call up the security companies, a separate security company that did a good job the past organizing our trips, everything, you know.
[00:14:34.869 --> 00:14:36.550]  Love, love, love, love, love the guy.
[00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:38.771]  I thought he was a great guy.
[00:14:40.772 --> 00:14:44.553]  And he's like, well, McGill is the boss and yeah, we're going to, and I'm like, no, he's not.
[00:14:44.574 --> 00:14:46.635]  You need to get real lawyers and talk to him.
[00:14:46.695 --> 00:14:47.715]  It's an LLC, dude.
[00:14:47.735 --> 00:14:48.415]  He can't do this.
[00:14:48.636 --> 00:14:49.276]  You can't shut it.
[00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:52.592]  Well, so they make the phone calls.
[00:14:53.093 --> 00:14:54.034]  They go, okay, fine.
[00:14:54.374 --> 00:15:03.143]  If there's a court order later next week, McGill's going to court tomorrow morning in Houston at like 11 o'clock, then we'll shut it down.
[00:15:03.163 --> 00:15:10.230]  And I'm like, yeah, if the Judge Lopez, who I think has been fair so far, appointed by Trump, if he does that, then I'm not going to argue about it.
[00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:13.913]  But I said, if you try it, I'm going to call the police.
[00:15:15.031 --> 00:15:16.532]  And I'm going to tell the police, where's the paperwork?
[00:15:16.552 --> 00:15:17.052]  Where's the proof?
[00:15:17.212 --> 00:15:19.693]  And I'm going to show them I'm the owner of LLC.
[00:15:19.953 --> 00:15:25.936]  I'm going to show them the documents that under the law, you cannot, the CRO is not the boss when it's an LLC.
[00:15:27.257 --> 00:15:27.997]  We got Ted News there.
[00:15:28.017 --> 00:15:29.278]  I'm about to go to him just to finish this.
[00:15:29.298 --> 00:15:30.278]  It'll take me 30 seconds.
[00:15:32.239 --> 00:15:34.661]  And I told the crew, I said, he's not going to stop.
[00:15:34.861 --> 00:15:37.002]  He may even hire another security company if he can buffalo him.
[00:15:37.782 --> 00:15:38.743]  I said, I got to go on air.
[00:15:38.803 --> 00:15:40.303]  So I go on air in the morning at 10 a.m.
[00:15:40.323 --> 00:15:41.224]  And I say, by noon,
[00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:49.773]  He will be calling up the security guy and telling him, shut it down.
[00:15:51.094 --> 00:15:51.575]  And he did that.
[00:15:51.595 --> 00:15:52.796]  And they go, how the hell do you know this?
[00:15:52.836 --> 00:15:56.139]  I said, I figured it would take him an hour to figure out we were on air and he'd go see it in panic.
[00:15:56.839 --> 00:15:59.842]  And then I got on air, I went back on air, and I learned he was trying to shut it down again yesterday.
[00:16:00.102 --> 00:16:03.625]  And I said, hey, McGill, I can go on 100 talk shows today if I want, dumbass.
[00:16:03.645 --> 00:16:05.026]  You're not going to stop me putting this out.
[00:16:05.366 --> 00:16:07.869]  And I said, and I'm not saying I'm going to do this if you do this.
[00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:10.551]  I'm going to the FBI with the recordings of you.
[00:16:11.786 --> 00:16:23.290]  I'm going to do you a real solid, for now I'm not going to air these, these other recordings I've got, of you literally trying to get me to commit crime, in my view, in my opinion.
[00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:30.572]  And so, literally he's watching, and he's like, then he makes calls to the lawyers, they go, yeah, he called up, he's dropping, and he's going to try to get a court order to shut it down.
[00:16:31.572 --> 00:16:38.935]  So, the hearing starts at 1130 tomorrow in Houston, Texas, Southern District Federal Court, Judge Lopez.
[00:16:40.427 --> 00:16:42.988]  And Judge Lopez might just say, shut it all down.
[00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:44.689]  Now, they've got to ship out the product.
[00:16:44.709 --> 00:16:45.370]  It's already been ordered.
[00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:49.832]  They've got to... I imagine the judges seem pretty reasonable and smart, actually, in deliberatives.
[00:16:49.852 --> 00:16:50.512]  I don't think he'll do that.
[00:16:50.532 --> 00:16:58.817]  I think he'll push out to the 14th, and he'll, you know, authorize the cash collateral meeting that's happening tomorrow.
[00:16:58.857 --> 00:17:00.658]  That's just a little footnote.
[00:17:00.678 --> 00:17:02.059]  And then that'll happen.
[00:17:03.945 --> 00:17:05.847]  The McGill guy is so charged up and things.
[00:17:05.867 --> 00:17:07.468]  I don't know what's going to be pulled.
[00:17:07.508 --> 00:17:09.350]  So we could be the judge might shut us down.
[00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:12.292]  The hearings over at like one o'clock tomorrow.
[00:17:12.772 --> 00:17:17.857]  He could issue an order to shut us down and then and then the order will be sent.
[00:17:18.677 --> 00:17:20.159]  And then I'm up here packing my stuff tonight.
[00:17:20.459 --> 00:17:24.923]  Got a U-Haul, you know, paintings, pictures, my clothes.
[00:17:24.943 --> 00:17:26.064]  I've got an office in the bathroom.
[00:17:26.904 --> 00:17:28.526]  After the showdown, I'm loading everything up on there.
[00:17:29.847 --> 00:17:31.088]  And that could be tomorrow.
[00:17:31.148 --> 00:17:32.029]  It'll probably be
[00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:35.170]  I'm going to go to Ted Nugent.
[00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:37.971]  I think we'll be shut down in about a month.
[00:17:38.311 --> 00:17:39.171]  And there's a lot that goes into it.
[00:17:39.191 --> 00:17:41.212]  It'll take an hour to explain it all, but I'm on this, okay?
[00:17:41.232 --> 00:17:44.252]  I mean, I spent like four hours a day talking to lawyers and all the people.
[00:17:44.973 --> 00:17:54.375]  But they said what McGill is doing, or I've just come to the realization that this is Alice in Wonderland stuff that's going on.
[00:17:55.730 --> 00:18:02.532]  He thinks, like he did in March, that he will take the company over and get rid of me, and that he's going to run this as his new company.
[00:18:02.572 --> 00:18:04.173]  It's cuckoo stuff.
[00:18:04.293 --> 00:18:06.253]  I mean, I can just believe my lawyers.
[00:18:06.834 --> 00:18:10.715]  I called and talked to Top, like the best guy in the state.
[00:18:11.772 --> 00:18:12.613]  I have really good lawyers.
[00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:15.235]  They're up at the top tier, but this guy recognizes the guy.
[00:18:15.575 --> 00:18:17.637]  He follows it and he can't stop watching it.
[00:18:18.638 --> 00:18:25.124]  I got an hour-long plus meeting with him today down in Houston over the phone.
[00:18:25.384 --> 00:18:27.386]  So Ted Nugent is a beautiful American.
[00:18:27.406 --> 00:18:28.967]  He'll be with us until 45 after.
[00:18:29.007 --> 00:18:32.811]  He's up at his wonderful Redoubt in Michigan.
[00:18:33.431 --> 00:18:37.875]  And he called me today, just like he does behind the scenes, like Charlton Heston would do sometimes.
[00:18:38.055 --> 00:18:38.916]  I'm not bragging about me.
[00:18:38.936 --> 00:18:41.999]  Charlton was such a classy guy, you know, call up sometimes and say, how you doing?
[00:18:42.019 --> 00:18:42.700]  You know, kick an ass.
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.722]  Only a few times before he got Alzheimer's and went away.
[00:18:45.762 --> 00:18:47.764]  But Ted heard about this call to see how I was doing.
[00:18:47.804 --> 00:18:52.428]  I got him to spend precious time because he works really hard, but he also goes and hunts and relaxes really hard.
[00:18:52.869 --> 00:18:56.872]  It's hard to get him off his hunting, but he canceled his hunting tonight for us.
[00:18:57.953 --> 00:18:58.233]  I get it.
[00:18:58.274 --> 00:18:59.215]  He zens out in the woods.
[00:18:59.235 --> 00:18:59.755]  That's what I do.
[00:18:59.815 --> 00:19:01.077]  It's like my only retreat.
[00:19:01.857 --> 00:19:03.179]  And he said he'd come on.
[00:19:03.279 --> 00:19:04.961]  And I asked him to tell, because he was worried about me.
[00:19:04.981 --> 00:19:08.204]  And I said, no, you're the guy that actually they tried to put in prison a bunch.
[00:19:08.645 --> 00:19:09.786]  You never made a big deal about it.
[00:19:09.826 --> 00:19:10.667]  But this is the same tag.
[00:19:10.687 --> 00:19:12.048]  He said, sure, I'll tell that story.
[00:19:12.409 --> 00:19:13.350]  So Ted Nugent joined us.
[00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:14.231]  We're going to break in 10 minutes.
[00:19:14.251 --> 00:19:15.072]  But Ted, I love you.
[00:19:15.492 --> 00:19:16.113]  You're beautiful.
[00:19:16.153 --> 00:19:17.955]  You're an amazing individual.
[00:19:18.215 --> 00:19:18.796]  TedNugent.com.
[00:19:20.978 --> 00:19:21.919]  You see what's happening here?
[00:19:21.959 --> 00:19:23.101]  There's a huge outpouring.
[00:19:23.662 --> 00:19:27.346]  It shows the Great Awakening's here, but it also shows this is a real communist takeover.
[00:19:27.386 --> 00:19:31.652]  So thank you, and if you could just give your brief take on what's happening to me, but let's move on from me for now.
[00:19:31.892 --> 00:19:34.015]  Let's talk about what they've done to you and how you came through it.
[00:19:35.393 --> 00:19:58.385]  Well Alex, number one, I gave you a call because I care about my fellow Americans, especially the Americans that the Founding Fathers wanted all of us to be, and that is to be a cockroach spotlighter, to be defiant, to question all authority, to be suspicious of all authority, to be suspicious of everybody who has power, because right now we're living the manifestation of the worst cultural deprivation in the history of America, where Uncle Sam is now
[00:19:59.085 --> 00:20:00.246]  I think he's the great Satan.
[00:20:00.527 --> 00:20:09.856]  Uncle Sam, our government is treasonous, it's communist, it's Marxist, it hates the Constitution, it violates the Constitutional Oath on an hourly basis.
[00:20:10.156 --> 00:20:15.021]  So I just wanted to call because I hang around with great, great Americans every day, the best Americans.
[00:20:15.341 --> 00:20:20.226]  Americans who put their heart and soul into being the best that they can be so that they're in the asset column.
[00:20:20.726 --> 00:20:21.106]  Of course!
[00:20:38.999 --> 00:20:40.820]  You know, it's called a criminal justice system.
[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:43.821]  It's actually a criminal justice system.
[00:20:43.841 --> 00:20:45.702]  The justice system is criminal.
[00:20:45.942 --> 00:20:58.427]  And what they're doing to you and what they've done to me, what they're doing to Donald Trump, is clear and present evidence that the court system, our government, none of the alphabet soup bureaucracies, none of them can be trusted.
[00:20:58.908 --> 00:21:04.270]  None of them do anything worthwhile or legal or constitutionally sound.
[00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:06.591]  So, Alex, I just wanted to call in and tell you that.
[00:21:07.264 --> 00:21:11.806]  Well, you and your wife, I've been a fan of you since I was a little kid, listening to your music.
[00:21:11.926 --> 00:21:13.127]  You know, my mom, dad listened to it.
[00:21:13.147 --> 00:21:13.967]  I'm a huge fan.
[00:21:14.007 --> 00:21:15.668]  I went to some of your concerts when I was a teenager.
[00:21:16.309 --> 00:21:17.649]  But you are a living legend.
[00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:19.710]  It's not about you, but it is super interesting.
[00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:21.131]  It's just about Americana.
[00:21:21.491 --> 00:21:22.712]  You've been doing this since the 60s.
[00:21:22.752 --> 00:21:24.152]  You're like the original Alex Jones.
[00:21:24.533 --> 00:21:32.156]  And I know, because I read the news articles, and I asked you at your house one time, we were having coffee, and you said, yeah, while you were playing the Star Spangled Banner before for me.
[00:21:32.176 --> 00:21:32.597]  Incredible.
[00:21:33.377 --> 00:21:39.240]  That on your guitar, yeah, you're losing 15, $20 million a year because Ticketmaster and Monopoly won't book you.
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:43.902]  You sell out theaters, you sell out 50,000 arenas, but they won't have Ted Nugent because you supported Trump.
[00:21:43.943 --> 00:21:44.963]  But you didn't back down.
[00:21:44.983 --> 00:21:45.603]  You didn't whine.
[00:21:45.623 --> 00:21:46.144]  You didn't cry.
[00:21:46.604 --> 00:21:47.384]  You've been through hell.
[00:21:47.404 --> 00:21:48.825]  And they've also tried to put you in prison.
[00:21:48.845 --> 00:21:49.946]  It happens all the time now.
[00:21:50.526 --> 00:21:51.707]  And it's like a blip.
[00:21:51.747 --> 00:21:53.067]  People don't take this serious.
[00:21:53.427 --> 00:21:56.169]  They think, oh, Ted Nugent's like John Wayne for real.
[00:21:56.589 --> 00:21:57.790]  And by the way, in person, he
[00:21:58.670 --> 00:21:59.551]  Well, you know,
[00:22:23.895 --> 00:22:36.783]  Immediately when I started realizing how corrupt our government was, the most egregious chapter was Barack Obama and his boyfriend Mike and Eric Holder and the whole FBI going into a criminal mafia organization.
[00:22:37.484 --> 00:22:45.549]  And I'll never forget that Barack Obama and Eric Holder sicked this really punk-ass Attorney General named Jack Schmidt.
[00:22:45.849 --> 00:22:47.550]  Yeah, his name is Jack Schmidt.
[00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:52.193]  He was up in Alaska and everybody hated the US Attorney Jack Schmidt.
[00:22:53.034 --> 00:22:57.576]  Everybody thought this guy was an absolute oath-violating punk because U.S.
[00:22:57.637 --> 00:23:04.861]  Attorney in Alaska Jack Schmidt was indeed an oath-violating punk, and they sicked him on me.
[00:23:05.221 --> 00:23:09.364]  The Game Department in Alaska didn't come after me because I put on a television show.
[00:23:09.404 --> 00:23:11.806]  Our Spirit of the Wild show has been on for 35 years.
[00:23:11.866 --> 00:23:18.170]  It's a top-rated hunting show, eight times a week on the Pursuit Network, and because I promote Second Amendment
[00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:19.151]  Perfectly.
[00:23:19.271 --> 00:23:20.372]  They can't debate me.
[00:23:20.412 --> 00:23:27.900]  They try and they completely get blown away by the self-evident truth that is a God-given, constitutional, guaranteed individual right.
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:36.569]  And so they wanted to mess with me for my, how dare I promote the Second Amendment as they're trying to take it away, and the hunting lifestyle because it's the definitive
[00:23:36.949 --> 00:23:39.351]  Independent, rugged individual lifestyle.
[00:23:39.371 --> 00:23:40.631]  We can take care of ourselves.
[00:23:40.872 --> 00:23:41.912]  We're self-sufficient.
[00:23:42.132 --> 00:23:43.894]  And Uncle Sam will have none of that.
[00:23:44.174 --> 00:23:51.859]  So they sick Jack Schmidt on me and charge me with a bear-killing crime that I put on television for 50 million viewers to witness.
[00:23:51.879 --> 00:23:55.141]  There's your desire to be criminal.
[00:23:55.721 --> 00:23:57.683]  And they wouldn't let it go.
[00:23:57.863 --> 00:24:11.357]  Even the judge in Ketchikan, Alaska said, Jack Schmidt, I've never heard of this law you're citing because it says that if Mr. Nugent's arrow or bullet touches a bear, that his tag is invalid if he doesn't recover that bear.
[00:24:11.517 --> 00:24:14.320]  Well, I ended up shooting the same bear, Alex.
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.741]  Even though my first arrow glanced off the bear and didn't hurt it.
[00:24:17.781 --> 00:24:21.822]  But my point is, is that they ran me through the grinder and they're going to corrupt me.
[00:24:21.862 --> 00:24:26.443]  And the attorney in Alaska said, you know, we'll win this, but it'll take all your money.
[00:24:26.463 --> 00:24:34.244]  It'll take a hundred million dollars and they will drag it through the courts just to make me a felon so I couldn't vote and I couldn't own a gun.
[00:24:34.444 --> 00:24:41.426]  So I beat it by, I should have done it, but I pled no contest to a misdemeanor Jack fine, just a fine.
[00:24:41.746 --> 00:24:42.826]  But Jack Schmidt,
[00:24:43.286 --> 00:24:44.207]  Jack Schmidt, U.S.
[00:24:44.287 --> 00:24:49.930]  Attorney in Alaska, do you lie to your kids like you lied to the court, like you violate your oath of the Constitution?
[00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:51.951]  And that's what you're putting up with right now.
[00:24:52.251 --> 00:25:04.318]  A corrupt criminal court system, a corrupt Department of Justice that is the Department of Anti-Justice infested with low-class, oath-violating, criminal punks.
[00:25:04.338 --> 00:25:06.939]  So we are with you and I wish you Godspeed, Alex.
[00:25:06.999 --> 00:25:08.080]  Well, let me just give you an example.
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.320]  This court-appointed CRO
[00:25:10.521 --> 00:25:16.203]  Didn't even look that we filed in court all the money we had in the bankruptcy.
[00:25:16.623 --> 00:25:20.184]  And he wouldn't respond when I'm like, I have this money since we declared bankruptcy.
[00:25:20.204 --> 00:25:21.824]  I need to put it into the company.
[00:25:22.444 --> 00:25:23.945]  And he was, oh, you just keep that money.
[00:25:24.625 --> 00:25:26.505]  And then he says it in front of my lawyers in three meetings.
[00:25:26.545 --> 00:25:27.065]  They write notes.
[00:25:27.085 --> 00:25:27.866]  They say, this isn't right.
[00:25:27.906 --> 00:25:28.866]  They say, you're being set up.
[00:25:29.526 --> 00:25:30.126]  I just said it.
[00:25:30.306 --> 00:25:30.826]  I was like, really?
[00:25:30.846 --> 00:25:32.027]  And they're like, this doesn't look good.
[00:25:33.207 --> 00:25:35.548]  And then so we're like, you know, start recording.
[00:25:36.308 --> 00:25:36.408]  And
[00:25:37.108 --> 00:25:46.901]  And then he still goes and files in court that I'm stealing money, not even knowing I'd filed months before in court that he wouldn't take the money, so we were asking the court what to do.
[00:25:47.142 --> 00:25:50.626]  They're just, you're right, they're low-life, they're stupid, they don't even do research.
[00:25:50.826 --> 00:25:53.210]  They just sit on their ass and make stuff up.
[00:25:54.512 --> 00:25:55.574]  It's crazy.
[00:25:56.274 --> 00:25:59.138]  Because you execute the First Amendment so perfectly.
[00:25:59.158 --> 00:25:59.739]  I'm not kidding.
[00:25:59.779 --> 00:26:00.700]  No, but it's like you said.
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:04.845]  You show the legal hunting of the bear all followed properly on video.
[00:26:05.546 --> 00:26:05.786]  Yes.
[00:26:05.927 --> 00:26:08.189]  Which disproves them and they still indict you for it.
[00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:08.730]  It's like...
[00:26:10.458 --> 00:26:14.803]  Because the whole system is so corrupt, the media, the academia, all of Hollywood.
[00:26:15.043 --> 00:26:21.971]  The Huffington Post writes these articles that are 100% false, totally false accusations, like they did recently.
[00:26:22.211 --> 00:26:28.659]  They claimed that the Texas Department of Wildlife, Texas Parks and Wildlife, killed hundreds of diseased deer.
[00:26:28.919 --> 00:26:29.759]  That's a lie!
[00:26:29.799 --> 00:26:42.606]  They went into Robert Williams Herd that only had a couple of chronic waste and disease positives by the veterinarian of the state and the USDA that has had false positives over and over and they slaughtered hundreds of healthy deer.
[00:26:42.626 --> 00:26:44.807]  That's the Texas Parks and Wildlife.
[00:26:45.027 --> 00:26:50.070]  Did you know in Australia they just killed half the honeybee population and there wasn't even a disease that was made up?
[00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:53.232]  Why do you think they're trying to kill hunting and fishing and farming worldwide?
[00:26:54.713 --> 00:27:01.156]  I appreciate you asking that rhetorical question, but everybody knows that Uncle Sam wants us dependent.
[00:27:01.416 --> 00:27:04.078]  They want us to be zombies.
[00:27:04.198 --> 00:27:05.738]  You know, they didn't kill zombie deer.
[00:27:05.898 --> 00:27:08.420]  Uncle Sam is trying to create zombie Americans.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:25.896]  If you're self-sufficient and a rugged individual and can take care of yourself, which identifies the hunting lifestyle, the farming, ranching lifestyle, they want us to eat their Bill Gates fake meat created out of chemical warfare in a lab someplace.
[00:27:25.916 --> 00:27:31.381]  And when I say things like this, when you say things like this, people go, well that's a ridiculous allegation!
[00:27:31.401 --> 00:27:32.722]  That's a conspiracy theory!
[00:27:32.722 --> 00:27:34.243]  No, no, Mainline Studies Show!
[00:27:34.284 --> 00:27:41.911]  It's all these disease tubes and bacteria they grow in vats and they put dye in it and squirt it out and they're gonna try to make the school children eat it.
[00:27:42.191 --> 00:27:43.493]  It's all happening!
[00:27:44.506 --> 00:27:49.209]  You know in the Netherlands, they produce, they're the second largest food producer in the world.
[00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.949]  It's a tiny country.
[00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:52.771]  The Dutch are the green thumb.
[00:27:52.811 --> 00:27:54.072]  Nobody says otherwise.
[00:27:54.512 --> 00:27:58.875]  They've shut a third of their farms and ranches down because they say cow farts are bad.
[00:27:59.115 --> 00:28:03.738]  Now they want to ban rice because it's grown in swamp and swamp creates methane, Ted.
[00:28:03.918 --> 00:28:05.539]  They're literally cutting off the food supply.
[00:28:06.641 --> 00:28:10.764]  And everybody knows that the videos are available to anybody who wants to get their head out of their ass.
[00:28:11.045 --> 00:28:15.748]  But bottom line, the hunting lifestyle... In fact, let me give you something really powerful here, Alex.
[00:28:16.209 --> 00:28:20.112]  I hope everybody will visit HunterNation.org.
[00:28:20.392 --> 00:28:21.873]  It sounds too good to be true.
[00:28:22.374 --> 00:28:24.095]  HunterNation.org.
[00:28:24.135 --> 00:28:25.216]  It's not about hunting.
[00:28:25.516 --> 00:28:27.018]  It's about conservatives.
[00:28:27.558 --> 00:28:28.719]  Thank you for joining us here today.
[00:28:58.021 --> 00:29:04.586]  Earlier this afternoon, Donald Trump was arraigned by a Manhattan grand jury on 34 felony counts.
[00:29:05.347 --> 00:29:06.828]  This case is an abomination.
[00:29:06.868 --> 00:29:08.390]  You know, it's obviously political.
[00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:10.471]  Seven years to try to come up with this case.
[00:29:10.932 --> 00:29:12.273]  They're just wrong on the law.
[00:29:12.653 --> 00:29:16.997]  The only crime that Donald Trump is being prosecuted for is the crime of running for president.
[00:29:17.237 --> 00:29:19.639]  Political persecution at the highest level.
[00:29:19.959 --> 00:29:22.581]  They've quite frankly given up on trying to beat him at the polls.
[00:29:22.801 --> 00:29:24.703]  Either going to steal it or stop it by law firm.
[00:29:24.923 --> 00:29:29.105]  Democrat prosecutor elected on a get Trump platform.
[00:29:29.185 --> 00:29:32.507]  What's going on here is a disgusting disgrace.
[00:29:33.087 --> 00:29:34.208]  It is war on Trump.
[00:29:34.808 --> 00:29:36.709]  It is war on the Republican Party.
[00:29:37.089 --> 00:29:38.650]  And it is a war on the Republicans.
[00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:45.033]  This case is the weakest case I've seen in 60 years of teaching, practicing, and writing about criminal law.
[00:29:45.333 --> 00:29:50.617]  I doubt the New York indictment would have been brought against a defendant whose name was not Donald Trump.
[00:29:50.857 --> 00:29:55.019]  This judge, I mean, you don't need a prosecutor if you have a judge like this.
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:56.741]  This judge is not on the level.
[00:29:56.761 --> 00:30:03.005]  It's a terrible case, but the judge has been pretty much a rubber stamp on everything that Bregg has wanted to do.
[00:30:03.025 --> 00:30:05.466]  They're perverting the system of justice.
[00:30:05.947 --> 00:30:07.628]  You know, that's where the danger lies.
[00:30:07.828 --> 00:30:10.750]  The corruption and subversion of our institutions by the left.
[00:30:12.071 --> 00:30:21.916]  This is the Democrats' entire strategy to confine President Trump to a dirty criminal courtroom and keep him off the campaign trail where he can bring his winning message to voters across this country.
[00:30:21.936 --> 00:30:24.097]  New York has become a legal banana republic.
[00:30:24.317 --> 00:30:26.738]  They are so determined to get Donald Trump.
[00:30:27.058 --> 00:30:30.079]  Look, convicting Donald Trump, that's all they have.
[00:30:30.379 --> 00:30:32.520]  I think they have no cards.
[00:30:32.941 --> 00:30:35.222]  And they're depending upon Trump getting convicted.
[00:30:35.382 --> 00:30:38.323]  That Trump train doesn't show any signs of slowing down.
[00:30:38.703 --> 00:30:39.944]  The only verdict that matters
[00:30:41.513 --> 00:30:42.868]  Is the verdict at the ballot box.
[00:30:52.188 --> 00:30:56.971]  If you don't get a high-quality gravity-fed filter from Infowarstore.com, please just get one.

[00:32:54.016 --> 00:32:59.942]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[00:33:04.206 --> 00:33:08.249]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:10.472]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:10.732 --> 00:33:11.913]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:12.373 --> 00:33:17.078]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:19.719 --> 00:33:31.829]  I'm telling you, there's so many great rock and roll riffs and intros, but if I had to sit there on my deathbed, in fact, at my funeral, I want Stranglehold played.
[00:33:31.869 --> 00:33:32.790]  I'm going to say that right now.
[00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:33.490]  That's a request.
[00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:38.595]  I've not written a will in a while, but in there, at my memorial service, whatever it is, I want Stranglehold played.
[00:33:39.956 --> 00:33:42.298]  Because it's just the genius of Ted Nugent.
[00:33:42.878 --> 00:33:43.739]  It's amazing, you know.
[00:33:44.377 --> 00:33:45.978]  Even on an acoustic guitar it works.
[00:33:46.058 --> 00:33:47.880]  You want to play it?
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:48.240]  Yeah.
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:49.721]  Go ahead.
[00:33:49.841 --> 00:33:51.422]  It's a cranker!
[00:34:14.445 --> 00:34:15.586]  I'm going to say it right now, man.
[00:34:15.626 --> 00:34:19.809]  It's so good fighting tyranny because I get to know all the best people, all the amazing people.
[00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:21.190]  That is so Americana.
[00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:22.591]  That makes it all worth it.
[00:34:22.631 --> 00:34:22.871]  Watch.
[00:34:22.971 --> 00:34:29.056]  I get to talk to Ted Nugent and watch him, for our audience, sit there on a... I love that song.
[00:34:29.076 --> 00:34:30.497]  ...brought tears to my eyes of joy.
[00:34:30.917 --> 00:34:31.918]  Ted, do it one more time.
[00:34:32.038 --> 00:34:33.039]  I just loved your face.
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:34.340]  God damn it.
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:35.101]  I'm sorry, Lord.
[00:34:35.201 --> 00:34:36.982]  This is a custom guitar.
[00:34:37.042 --> 00:34:39.604]  I think your viewers will appreciate this guitar.
[00:34:39.964 --> 00:34:43.287]  This guitar raises money for the Ted Nugent Camp for Kids charity.
[00:34:43.847 --> 00:34:48.631]  And you can get this guitar by emailing Toby at Ted Nugent dot com.
[00:34:48.711 --> 00:34:50.653]  It's a love song guitar, you know.
[00:34:50.893 --> 00:34:58.739]  But the licks all come from the Motown Masters, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, and I just kind of Nugent-ized everything by getting a rhythm going.
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:00.881]  The Stranglehold is the perfect example of that.
[00:35:00.941 --> 00:35:03.984]  I just sat down with my guitar one day and I just went...
[00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:40.072]  I do this all the time in the Man Cave Cuckoo's Nest, the arsenal of democracy.
[00:35:40.132 --> 00:35:42.794]  It's the theme song for shit kickers everywhere.
[00:35:43.629 --> 00:35:50.796]  You were saying during the break we were talking that we can't swing a dead cat and I had a globalist, you know, a hundred globalists.
[00:35:50.836 --> 00:35:54.200]  I mean, these people are just crawling out of their holes right now because they know they're losing.
[00:35:55.407 --> 00:35:56.827]  Yeah, you know, people are speaking up.
[00:35:56.867 --> 00:35:59.148]  We are discovered that, you know, really heartbreaking.
[00:35:59.168 --> 00:36:06.150]  I think we talked about this in one of our many conversations, Alex, that I'm a hunter and I thought the hunters are the ultimate rugged individuals.
[00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:07.470]  They're the real conservation.
[00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:17.353]  If you want clean air, soil and water, it's going to be because of the money and the dedication, walking the wild ground, the resource stewardship instinct of the hunting, fishing, trapping.
[00:36:17.573 --> 00:36:20.954]  That's who created the original conservation movement, for people who don't know, was the hunters.
[00:36:21.874 --> 00:36:23.335]  Jerry, we cleaned up Lake Erie.
[00:36:23.355 --> 00:36:26.756]  When I was growing up in Detroit, Lake Erie would spontaneously combust.
[00:36:26.796 --> 00:36:27.716]  It would catch fire.
[00:36:27.977 --> 00:36:29.137]  But it was the trappers.
[00:36:29.457 --> 00:36:30.558]  It was the duck hunters.
[00:36:30.638 --> 00:36:32.559]  It was the fishermen that sounded the alarm.
[00:36:32.799 --> 00:36:36.440]  And now it's the greatest walleye and smallmouth bass fishery in the world.
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:37.461]  The waterfowl is back.
[00:36:37.501 --> 00:36:38.681]  The wild salary is back.
[00:36:38.921 --> 00:36:40.502]  And that's because people who walk
[00:36:40.922 --> 00:36:41.162]  Thank you.
[00:37:00.965 --> 00:37:03.708]  The majority of licensed hunters didn't vote.
[00:37:04.309 --> 00:37:06.211]  Now, we've changed that in a number of states.
[00:37:06.251 --> 00:37:12.277]  The most recent amazing victory was in Louisiana, where we got all constitutionalists back in power.
[00:37:12.657 --> 00:37:17.562]  But if we really want to change the election horror stories of the recent past,
[00:37:18.163 --> 00:37:19.804]  HunterNation.org.
[00:37:19.824 --> 00:37:20.945]  You always hammer this.
[00:37:21.085 --> 00:37:25.087]  What is wrong with conservatives and populists hiding and not voting?
[00:37:25.427 --> 00:37:29.309]  You do, I know, tons of interviews, hundreds a month probably.
[00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:31.051]  I hear you everywhere.
[00:37:31.751 --> 00:37:32.812]  You work your ass off.
[00:37:32.852 --> 00:37:34.973]  So you're not playing games here.
[00:37:35.553 --> 00:37:39.395]  So in the 10 minutes or less we have left here, let's talk about Trump.
[00:37:39.535 --> 00:37:40.316]  What a badass.
[00:37:40.416 --> 00:37:42.797]  What a... I mean, because I know his work schedule.
[00:37:42.817 --> 00:37:44.538]  People that know him very well as you know him very well.
[00:37:45.379 --> 00:37:46.900]  We're talking 18 hours at least.
[00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:49.394]  Other than a few hours with his wife for dinner.
[00:37:50.838 --> 00:37:53.019]  He literally, the more he's under attack, the stronger he gets.
[00:37:53.119 --> 00:37:53.720]  It's not an act.
[00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:55.801]  This guy, this guy's like Superman.
[00:37:55.842 --> 00:37:57.863]  I mean, because I see other people.
[00:37:57.923 --> 00:37:59.124]  He's like 78 years old.
[00:37:59.144 --> 00:38:00.125]  I know you're 70 plus.
[00:38:00.185 --> 00:38:00.966]  You look like you're 60.
[00:38:01.326 --> 00:38:04.909]  This guy, though, just radiates energy when you're around him in person.
[00:38:05.289 --> 00:38:08.692]  And then you see him taking these attacks because I've been under a lot of attack.
[00:38:09.032 --> 00:38:09.552]  So have you.
[00:38:09.612 --> 00:38:11.494]  But and it's terrible and it's nasty.
[00:38:11.514 --> 00:38:12.395]  And it actually gets to me.
[00:38:12.455 --> 00:38:12.735]  I'm only 50.
[00:38:12.875 --> 00:38:14.496]  And I'll be honest about it.
[00:38:14.516 --> 00:38:15.157]  I mean, I'm tough.
[00:38:15.337 --> 00:38:15.957]  I'm not a wimp.
[00:38:16.498 --> 00:38:17.158]  I'm pretty tough.
[00:38:18.419 --> 00:38:18.519]  But
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:20.980]  Trump is next level.
[00:38:21.021 --> 00:38:22.781]  I mean, this guy's only got to be admired.
[00:38:22.961 --> 00:38:25.242]  I just can't believe God gave us somebody like this at this time.
[00:38:26.302 --> 00:38:28.843]  I'll be 76 in December and I got a lot of energy.
[00:38:28.863 --> 00:38:30.083]  I'm really inspired every day.
[00:38:30.123 --> 00:38:32.104]  I've married the most wonderful woman in the world.
[00:38:32.144 --> 00:38:35.345]  My kids, my dogs, my band, my crew, everybody, my hunting buddies.
[00:38:35.365 --> 00:38:36.345]  We have sunrise acres.
[00:38:36.365 --> 00:38:37.746]  You look like you're 60, Ted.
[00:38:38.346 --> 00:38:38.886]  What are you doing?
[00:38:40.351 --> 00:38:44.294]  I'm eating a lot of venison and I've been clean and sober for 76 years, that's the trick.
[00:38:44.554 --> 00:38:48.998]  But the bottom line is, when I spend time with Donald Trump, the guy really dazzles me.
[00:38:49.059 --> 00:38:57.606]  The guy is older than I am, but he is so passionate and dedicated, literally to the simple phrase, the colloquialism now, make America great again.
[00:38:57.646 --> 00:39:02.471]  If I can show this hat on your show, Alex, I've signed over 100,000 of these hats.
[00:39:03.892 --> 00:39:05.314]  I put my personal signature.
[00:39:05.334 --> 00:39:06.475]  We got an assembly line here.
[00:39:06.775 --> 00:39:11.781]  If people would like one of these hats, I blocked it off because I don't know how stifled your censorship might be.
[00:39:11.801 --> 00:39:14.364]  We're on talk radio, but the liberals are allowed to cuss.
[00:39:14.384 --> 00:39:15.085]  We just delay it out.
[00:39:15.105 --> 00:39:16.346]  You know what the hat says.
[00:39:16.406 --> 00:39:16.887]  You say it.
[00:39:16.927 --> 00:39:17.367]  Go ahead.
[00:39:18.749 --> 00:39:21.490]  And if people want one of these hats, I sign them every day.
[00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:23.190]  They're available at TedNugent.com.
[00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:38.693]  But the reason I'm saying this is because we're donating money to Donald Trump, which everybody raised a very powerful financial middle finger recently after this Department of Anti-Justice in New York falsely accused and falsely convicted this great man.
[00:39:38.773 --> 00:39:40.333]  He really is a powerhouse.
[00:39:40.573 --> 00:39:41.273]  And you know why?
[00:39:41.633 --> 00:39:43.114]  Because he is obsessed
[00:39:44.614 --> 00:39:52.080]  With saving America, because America's in final toilet flush, thanks to this zombie devil snake in the White House.
[00:39:52.461 --> 00:39:56.604]  Right now, this Joe Biden is not even a real human being, he's just some kind of... I love that!
[00:39:56.964 --> 00:40:04.851]  Say it again, zombie devil snake, and then say... I'm gonna put a promo out, I'm gonna put a promo out, say elect that motherfucker again because I interrupted you, go ahead.
[00:40:06.394 --> 00:40:11.219]  Yeah, but Biden really is some kind of strange cosmic devil snake.
[00:40:11.299 --> 00:40:16.965]  I mean, he's just a horrible, horrible, dishonest, treasonous, gangster punk.
[00:40:17.425 --> 00:40:19.347]  And Donald Trump sees what's happening.
[00:40:19.387 --> 00:40:24.892]  That's why they all went after him, because he spotlighted the cockroaches like nobody before.
[00:40:25.193 --> 00:40:28.276]  And the cockroaches are really pissed off, so the cockroaches
[00:40:28.596 --> 00:40:33.457]  Are falsely accusing this man, falsely charging this man, falsely convicting this man.
[00:40:33.737 --> 00:40:38.959]  So if you really want to raise a financial middle finger, go to DonaldJTrump.com.
[00:40:39.219 --> 00:40:43.940]  And I got buddies donating $10, $20, $50, a couple guys a lot more than that.
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:55.023]  But we need to show the whole world that real, honest to God, American shit-kickers in the asset column are willing to sacrifice financially to support Donald Trump.
[00:40:55.043 --> 00:40:56.523]  Because if we don't get him elected,
[00:40:56.943 --> 00:41:02.669]  The zombie devil snake Biden gangsters will take us on our final toilet flush.
[00:41:02.949 --> 00:41:05.913]  And if we the people let that happen, I suppose we deserve it.
[00:41:17.864 --> 00:41:26.128]  But you are always about donating, and I know people that know you behind the scenes, like you're giving all this money to real causes.
[00:41:26.148 --> 00:41:28.849]  You're literally doing talk radio interviews all over the country every day.
[00:41:29.709 --> 00:41:31.150]  That's where the real war is.
[00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:35.632]  And conservatives and populists and Christians better start spending your money, folks.
[00:41:35.932 --> 00:41:38.413]  You better, it takes money to win wars.
[00:41:38.993 --> 00:41:41.795]  And we can outdo Soros if all the little people fight back.
[00:41:41.835 --> 00:41:43.636]  In the Bilderberg Group, we got documents ten years ago.
[00:41:43.936 --> 00:41:48.158]  They're like, we hate the fact the public still has money to donate to populist and conservative causes.
[00:41:48.978 --> 00:41:52.600]  We've got to make everybody so poor that they can't resist us.
[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:54.441]  They're scared of us using our money.
[00:41:54.942 --> 00:42:04.187]  And all these middle class and upper middle class and nouveau riche conservatives that don't spend a fucking nickel in the fight and they keep their head down and hope somebody else does it.
[00:42:04.987 --> 00:42:07.389]  I've had a lot of rich people call me and say, oh, you're doing such a great job.
[00:42:07.409 --> 00:42:08.009]  Thank you so much.
[00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:10.711]  And I literally look at them and I say, you're worth like five million dollars.
[00:42:11.432 --> 00:42:12.733]  What the fuck are you doing?
[00:42:13.133 --> 00:42:15.215]  You're going to lose it all if you don't go all in.
[00:42:15.575 --> 00:42:16.696]  They're like, yeah, we're starting to figure it.
[00:42:16.716 --> 00:42:29.645]  So I think, though, not just the general grassroots is getting up with record small donations to Trump that shattered everything, but a lot of the big money that's been in the shadows that wasn't communist now gets, oh, wow, we're actually this is a real takeover.
[00:42:29.745 --> 00:42:30.126]  Exactly.
[00:42:30.146 --> 00:42:33.008]  You better spend half the money you've got.
[00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:34.051]  All of it!
[00:42:34.313 --> 00:42:36.221]  Or you're gonna lose it, you dumb bastards!
[00:42:36.743 --> 00:42:37.768]  That's what you're saying.
[00:42:38.677 --> 00:42:39.357]  It's pretty obvious.
[00:42:39.397 --> 00:42:41.558]  My son and I, we do an assembly line every day.
[00:42:41.598 --> 00:42:45.380]  We've sold a couple hundred thousand of these, too, and we donate.
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:43:02.068]  We estimated recently that my autographed guitars, guns, bows and arrows, skulls, antlers, machetes, these flags, these hats, we have raised over $23 million for children's charities, law enforcement, military charities, conservation charities.
[00:43:02.308 --> 00:43:03.608]  And it's not Ted Nugent money.
[00:43:03.949 --> 00:43:06.830]  It's the people who get something with a lot of mojo, an autograph.
[00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:08.951]  I will not comply.
[00:43:09.271 --> 00:43:11.173]  Tell us where we find all this.
[00:43:12.134 --> 00:43:12.474]  I want it.
[00:43:12.494 --> 00:43:13.675]  I want the guitar for my wife.
[00:43:13.695 --> 00:43:15.596]  I want the flag.
[00:43:15.616 --> 00:43:16.257]  I'm ordering it all now.
[00:43:16.277 --> 00:43:16.717]  Where do we get it?
[00:43:17.884 --> 00:43:19.045]  Ted Nugent dot com.
[00:43:19.065 --> 00:43:20.427]  They're on sale all the time.
[00:43:20.787 --> 00:43:23.309]  We literally have an assembly line every day signing guitars.
[00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:30.416]  I've signed a bunch of skulls and antlers for children's charities and we're doing an NRA banquet in Yankton, South Dakota.
[00:43:30.436 --> 00:43:31.517]  The Friends of the NRA.
[00:43:31.557 --> 00:43:37.363]  We're making sure that the money goes to the local schools shooting sports and the different conservation organizations.
[00:43:37.623 --> 00:43:39.024]  But people really dig deep.
[00:43:39.064 --> 00:43:43.908]  But now, more than ever, Alex, we've got to show a financial middle finger for Donald Trump.
[00:43:44.148 --> 00:43:57.137]  So whether you buy stuff from Ted Nugent and I make the donation or you go right to DonaldJTrump.com, whatever you can afford, even if you can't afford it, give to that great man so we can tell the deep state to kiss our flames away.
[00:43:57.237 --> 00:43:59.839]  And by the way, I've been to your place and hung out with you quite a bit.
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.341]  It's not wrong to have money and stuff.
[00:44:02.362 --> 00:44:07.206]  You've given up so much to do this, but it's incredibly humble where you live and how you live.
[00:44:07.726 --> 00:44:11.630]  But I got to say, I love the fact you got the same black Hellcat, same year.
[00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:13.091]  You got the same car as me.
[00:44:13.471 --> 00:44:15.573]  When I was at your house, I saw you have the same car.
[00:44:15.673 --> 00:44:16.634]  Oh, look at that.
[00:44:16.914 --> 00:44:22.219]  Man, I mean, I don't have that car anymore, but I mean, because I had to give it up and all this, but man, I just, it's so cool.
[00:44:22.259 --> 00:44:25.262]  Like, wow, you got the same car the same year.
[00:44:25.602 --> 00:44:26.803]  That is so crazy.
[00:44:26.823 --> 00:44:27.544]  We drive the same car.
[00:44:28.769 --> 00:44:32.813]  Well, I actually got one of the new Demon 170s with 1025 horsepower.
[00:44:32.853 --> 00:44:33.854]  I just couldn't resist.
[00:44:34.214 --> 00:44:35.995]  I love horsepower and I love freedom.
[00:44:36.196 --> 00:44:42.982]  And by the way, the money I have not wasted in my life, I could buy the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
[00:44:43.102 --> 00:44:45.004]  I just don't spend money willy-nilly.
[00:44:45.124 --> 00:44:46.225]  I save and save.
[00:44:46.545 --> 00:44:48.447]  I make donations to important causes.
[00:44:48.707 --> 00:44:51.950]  And then I find I have a little left over, so I buy some Detroit muscle.
[00:44:53.562 --> 00:45:03.511]  I love George Strait, and I got a chance to another well-known, another great musician invited me to his birthday party a long time ago, and we're up there north, you know, out by Fredericksburg.
[00:45:03.531 --> 00:45:09.677]  All of a sudden, he only comes in for like, he drove all the way out there from his ranch, like an hour from south of San Antonio to go to this thing.
[00:45:10.137 --> 00:45:12.319]  Hour and a half, he walks in, plays three songs.
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:18.485]  Jason Hall was playing the deal in his band, but I'm there, and I'm like, that's George Strait.
[00:45:18.585 --> 00:45:21.308]  He's in a ball cap, and then, you know, George Strait leaves.
[00:45:21.348 --> 00:45:22.729]  I was so awe-inspired.
[00:45:22.789 --> 00:45:24.351]  I listened to him since I was a kid.
[00:45:24.871 --> 00:45:30.097]  He leaves, but I go see his concerts, and he does stuff for veterans and has the American flag, and it's all great.
[00:45:30.577 --> 00:45:33.200]  But what if, because we know behind the scenes he's like Ted Nugent,
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:34.520]  I know his band.
[00:45:34.741 --> 00:45:35.921]  They're like huge listeners.
[00:45:36.642 --> 00:45:37.422]  Why?
[00:45:37.962 --> 00:45:38.803]  We're down to the wire.
[00:45:38.923 --> 00:45:40.103]  I'm not calling him out.
[00:45:40.143 --> 00:45:42.965]  I'm just saying, don't we need people?
[00:45:43.585 --> 00:45:44.486]  Like Willie's a good guy.
[00:45:44.506 --> 00:45:44.906]  I know him well.
[00:45:44.946 --> 00:45:47.067]  I've been long-term friends with him, but he's brainwashed.
[00:45:47.507 --> 00:45:48.808]  And now, you know, brain's gone.
[00:45:48.848 --> 00:45:50.049]  But I knew him 20 years ago.
[00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:51.910]  I used to go to his house and play chess and stuff.
[00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:54.111]  But the point is, Willie's off in his own world.
[00:45:54.291 --> 00:45:54.831]  We forgive him.
[00:45:54.851 --> 00:45:55.332]  We love Willie.
[00:45:55.632 --> 00:45:59.994]  But Straight is like you, but won't be public because he is so humble.
[00:46:00.054 --> 00:46:01.175]  We need George Straight.
[00:46:02.095 --> 00:46:03.456]  Okay, they took Hank Williams Jr.
[00:46:03.476 --> 00:46:04.577]  down for a while for what he said.
[00:46:04.897 --> 00:46:08.879]  We need all these guys that are Americana and Patriots to speak out.
[00:46:08.959 --> 00:46:14.463]  Why will Ted Nugent do it and Kid Rock will do it, but nobody else, I'm sorry, nobody else has got the balls.
[00:46:14.503 --> 00:46:15.643]  I mean, we're going to lose everything.
[00:46:16.044 --> 00:46:18.405]  I think it would really help if George Strait went public.
[00:46:18.425 --> 00:46:19.826]  I'm sorry to call him out, but that's what I'm saying.
[00:46:20.714 --> 00:46:21.535]  Well, George is great.
[00:46:21.555 --> 00:46:30.923]  He just did another Wounded Warrior benefit and gave away something like 200, 300 beautiful custom homes to the heroes of the military.
[00:46:31.203 --> 00:46:32.224]  So George is doing a great job.
[00:46:32.244 --> 00:46:32.784]  But you're right.
[00:46:32.824 --> 00:46:33.765]  You're absolutely correct.
[00:46:33.845 --> 00:46:35.987]  I could name you 10 A-listers.
[00:46:36.067 --> 00:46:39.210]  I'm talking top A-list celebrities.
[00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:48.557]  Country guys, Hollywood actors, that literally will look me in the eye and say the worst thing an American can say, and that is, I'm not into politics.
[00:46:49.118 --> 00:46:58.405]  One A-lister, I won't mention his name, top country artist in the world, he literally said, I'm not going to piss off the liberals, they're good for $50 million a year.
[00:46:58.465 --> 00:47:00.407]  And I wanted to punch him in the throat.
[00:47:00.867 --> 00:47:02.128]  I said, you've got to be kidding me.
[00:47:02.169 --> 00:47:04.110]  Don't worry about your grandkids or your kids.
[00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:05.311]  Don't worry about your country.
[00:47:05.591 --> 00:47:08.454]  If you're not into politics, you're a shitty American.
[00:47:09.154 --> 00:47:11.315]  They're the American dreams about politics.
[00:47:13.577 --> 00:47:15.258]  That's what I'm saying, is I get it.
[00:47:16.058 --> 00:47:18.560]  That's how we got here, is don't talk about God and politics.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:23.843]  Bull, man, we are in total red-level emergency here, and that's why I admire you so much.
[00:47:23.903 --> 00:47:29.986]  Not only are you a great guy and funny and smart and a friend, it's so good when I get upset about the world to know, hey, there's Ted Nugent.
[00:47:30.066 --> 00:47:30.466]  You know what I mean?
[00:47:30.486 --> 00:47:31.187]  There's Donald Trump.
[00:47:32.067 --> 00:47:37.510]  You know, there's Matt Gaetz, there's Devin Nunes, there's Jim Jordan.
[00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:40.071]  It's just like, I just can't believe it.
[00:47:40.671 --> 00:47:45.033]  We're in so much trouble, and if we just had the men stand up, it'd be over quickly.
[00:47:46.363 --> 00:47:50.946]  Well, you know, we're going to cover for those spineless wonders out there that are not into politics.
[00:47:50.966 --> 00:48:01.992]  You know, the American dream, the experiment in self-government, the very phrase, we the people, demands that we engage and we participate in this blood and guts earned experiment in self-government.
[00:48:02.032 --> 00:48:02.753]  That is politics.
[00:48:02.773 --> 00:48:04.934]  The American dream is all about politics.
[00:48:05.314 --> 00:48:14.440]  Well, I'll tell you, once again, HunterNation.org, we have crowbarred a lot of apathetic conservatives to get involved, and that's what I hope that we're accomplishing here at Zales.
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:15.901]  We're good to go.
[00:48:30.715 --> 00:48:51.723]  And to raise hell, you should be calling your senator, your congressman, your governor, your chief of police, your state trooper commander, your sheriff, your mayor, every citizen should be calling all of our elected employees and saying that we know what's happening to Donald Trump in New York, that's not justice, that is an absolute banana republic kangaroo court, and we need to express this to everybody in America
[00:48:52.023 --> 00:49:02.710]  So that they know that it's not just Donald Trump and his inner circle, it's shit kickers across the fruited plain that see the egregious oath violations that the Joe Biden administration is guilty of.
[00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:03.270]  I agree.
[00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:04.371]  You've got a great internal clock.
[00:49:04.391 --> 00:49:05.191]  You think we're going to break?
[00:49:05.231 --> 00:49:05.992]  I've got a few more minutes.
[00:49:06.032 --> 00:49:06.592]  Please stay with us.
[00:49:06.952 --> 00:49:08.133]  Another two or three and I've got to go.
[00:49:08.473 --> 00:49:09.274]  But, but, but, but Ted.
[00:49:10.134 --> 00:49:22.322]  Kid Rock shot up Bud Light and triggered this entire multi-billion dollar collapse of their whole thing, and then all the other major corporate sponsors pulled away from promoting all this pedophile, transgender, target the kid stuff.
[00:49:22.662 --> 00:49:26.505]  And you know, the kid's not been around as long as you, he's a smart guy, but not as articulate as you.
[00:49:26.885 --> 00:49:32.329]  The point is, is that, look at the power of that, and it's a beautiful thing.
[00:49:32.369 --> 00:49:33.790]  So briefly speak to that, and then in closing,
[00:49:36.224 --> 00:49:40.807]  Looking at the entire world and what's happening, this is the death throes of the left.
[00:49:40.867 --> 00:49:41.508]  They're in trouble.
[00:49:41.548 --> 00:49:43.009]  That's why we forced them out in the open.
[00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:45.191]  That's a very positive thing.
[00:49:45.251 --> 00:49:50.094]  But if we don't rise the occasion now that they've gone into war mode, we're going to lose everything.
[00:49:50.214 --> 00:49:55.138]  And what is your final statement just to the viewers about how critical this election is?
[00:49:55.158 --> 00:49:57.700]  I mean, everybody always says this election is the biggest ever.
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:01.302]  No, this is hands down 10 times bigger than anything since George Washington.
[00:50:01.542 --> 00:50:02.123]  I mean, this is it.
[00:50:03.373 --> 00:50:06.934]  Well, I remember when I pulled off on the highway to call you the first time and I heard you on the radio.
[00:50:06.954 --> 00:50:12.976]  I wasn't aware of you, but when I listened to you, I went, my God, I guess I'm not the only one that believes in truth, logic, and common sense.
[00:50:13.336 --> 00:50:18.177]  So I called you from the highway and I said the following, and I'll say it now because it's still true.
[00:50:18.557 --> 00:50:22.378]  The real suicidal curse of America isn't Marxism.
[00:50:22.618 --> 00:50:23.679]  It's not the Democrats.
[00:50:23.759 --> 00:50:24.919]  It's not the Joe Biden gang.
[00:50:24.979 --> 00:50:25.919]  It's not communism.
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:27.620]  It's apathy.
[00:50:28.601 --> 00:50:33.464]  There are so many conservatives that have never called their elected employees and told them what we believe.
[00:50:33.685 --> 00:50:45.373]  When Kyle Rittenhouse executed perfect self-defense on video, every conservative should have called every one of their elected employees and go, we support Kyle Rittenhouse, we believe in self-defense.
[00:50:45.693 --> 00:50:46.934]  Do you, Mr. Mayor?
[00:50:46.974 --> 00:50:47.754]  Do you, Senator?
[00:50:47.794 --> 00:50:48.635]  Do you, Congressman?
[00:50:48.655 --> 00:50:50.316]  Do you, Governor, believe in self-defense?
[00:50:50.536 --> 00:50:53.898]  Because that was cut and dry, undeniable self-defense.
[00:50:54.159 --> 00:50:55.960]  And right now, apathy.
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:51:19.058]  Is the toilet flush of America, and if we could just get a meaningful percentage of conservatives to get out and vote for Donald Trump, and get everybody in their family, at church, at school, at the shooting range, at the barbecue, at the bowling alley, at Deer Camp, in the fishing boat, if we could get everybody to vote and raise hell for Donald Trump, a donation would be wonderful, but to get out the conservative army, that's what
[00:51:19.458 --> 00:51:21.480]  HunterNation.org.
[00:51:21.801 --> 00:51:27.787]  We are galvanizing the licensed hunting families that have heretofore not voted, Alex.
[00:51:27.847 --> 00:51:29.028]  It's just so embarrassing.
[00:51:29.388 --> 00:51:30.389]  It's simple.
[00:51:30.409 --> 00:51:32.351]  You're recruiting the hunters.
[00:51:32.391 --> 00:51:33.092]  You got the data.
[00:51:33.352 --> 00:51:33.893]  What did you say?
[00:51:33.933 --> 00:51:35.835]  What percentage of hunters were voting before you got involved?
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:41.164]  But there was not one state that had 50% of licensed hunters that voted.
[00:51:41.564 --> 00:51:43.986]  Most states had 60-some percent that never registered.
[00:51:44.006 --> 00:51:45.808]  Their way of life is under total attack.
[00:51:45.848 --> 00:51:46.128]  I get it.
[00:51:46.148 --> 00:51:47.089]  They're hiding, hunting.
[00:51:47.329 --> 00:51:48.230]  They're trying to stay out of it.
[00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:49.691]  That's a good way to stay sane.
[00:51:49.731 --> 00:51:51.312]  But you can't when they're encroaching.
[00:51:52.373 --> 00:51:53.154]  In final closing,
[00:51:55.342 --> 00:52:01.625]  One more time I can't help it at your house with you and when you play the guitar it's so amazing to play the electric guitar for us and so much more.
[00:52:01.645 --> 00:52:07.808]  I'm gonna let you go you gotta get back what you're doing but just just play Stranglehold one more time I'm sorry I've got I've got to ask for it.
[00:52:08.608 --> 00:52:12.570]  I'll tell you what I'll do I actually have a mighty Birdland guitar here.
[00:52:15.689 --> 00:52:18.050]  Does that sound like a guitar on the technology?
[00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:19.170]  I love it.
[00:52:19.511 --> 00:52:21.751]  If you want to play the Star Spangled Brother, whatever you want.
[00:52:44.411 --> 00:52:44.491]  Yeah.
[00:53:08.459 --> 00:53:09.079]  Woo!
[00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:11.701]  All right, Ted, you are amazing.
[00:53:11.761 --> 00:53:12.462]  We love you.
[00:53:12.582 --> 00:53:14.243]  Say hi to your wonderful wife, Shemaine.
[00:53:14.583 --> 00:53:15.684]  We'll talk to you soon, brother.
[00:53:15.704 --> 00:53:16.264]  God bless you.
[00:53:17.105 --> 00:53:18.106]  Godspeed, Alex Jones.
[00:53:18.126 --> 00:53:19.186]  God bless real America.
[00:53:19.266 --> 00:53:21.348]  HunterNation.org, damn it.
[00:53:22.028 --> 00:53:22.569]  God bless you.
[00:53:23.649 --> 00:53:24.830]  That is such a critical thing.
[00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:25.591]  It's on record.
[00:53:25.611 --> 00:53:29.774]  They're so pissed trying to indict him because he's mobilized.
[00:53:30.354 --> 00:53:33.336]  The articles I've seen, I think they say, God, we hate Ted Nugent.
[00:53:33.376 --> 00:53:34.977]  Like, he's gotten 20 million extra voters.
[00:53:35.057 --> 00:53:37.399]  I mean, they are so pissed at that guy.
[00:53:38.865 --> 00:53:42.306]  It's not like some retard left us knocking on your door trying to get you to register Democrat.
[00:53:42.326 --> 00:53:43.887]  This guy is savaging it.
[00:53:44.807 --> 00:53:45.768]  He has concerts.
[00:53:45.808 --> 00:53:50.270]  He's got to go to county, you know, halls and sports stadiums with 20,000 people at it.
[00:53:50.330 --> 00:53:53.071]  And then he donates the money to sign everybody up to vote right there.
[00:53:53.091 --> 00:54:00.434]  Because I've been to these and sat back even though I was there and watched him for two hours sign autographs and get people to sign up for voters.
[00:54:01.954 --> 00:54:11.081]  70-something years old, 76 years old, just played two hours, literally sitting there for hours getting people to sign up for voting.
[00:54:11.261 --> 00:54:13.023]  That's a warrior, people.
[00:54:13.783 --> 00:54:15.205]  And that's the type of spirit we've got to have.
[00:54:15.225 --> 00:54:16.786]  And all this horrible stuff happening to us.
[00:54:20.689 --> 00:54:24.732]  If you look at the New World Order, their minions, they can barely talk because they serve Satan.
[00:54:24.772 --> 00:54:25.273]  Look at our people.
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:29.561]  Black, white, old, young, you name it.
[00:54:29.581 --> 00:54:32.944]  I mean, it's just, it's an amazing time to be alive.
[00:54:33.144 --> 00:54:44.593]  And yeah, they tried to shut this company down for, quote, just two weeks for no reason, claiming, oh, we want to wait till the hearing.
[00:54:44.613 --> 00:54:45.934]  You know, the judge said, keep the company open.
[00:54:47.895 --> 00:54:48.916]  Because it was never going to come back.
[00:54:49.276 --> 00:54:50.798]  And that's how the left works.
[00:54:51.358 --> 00:54:53.760]  You think the CRO came up with that two-week thing?
[00:54:55.322 --> 00:54:56.783]  You think they just came up with that?
[00:54:56.823 --> 00:54:58.084]  No, it's just two weeks.
[00:54:58.285 --> 00:55:00.206]  It's three days.
[00:55:00.266 --> 00:55:01.087]  No, now it's just two weeks.
[00:55:01.207 --> 00:55:04.350]  It's gone.
[00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:05.271]  Don't make a big deal about it.
[00:55:05.291 --> 00:55:05.812]  Don't say anything.
[00:55:06.672 --> 00:55:07.813]  I'm like, I'm going to say something right now.
[00:55:07.873 --> 00:55:08.414]  Oh, no, no, no.
[00:55:08.434 --> 00:55:09.175]  Don't do that.
[00:55:09.195 --> 00:55:09.535]  Don't do that.
[00:55:10.536 --> 00:55:11.216]  And I said, watch.
[00:55:11.237 --> 00:55:12.558]  They're going to try to shut it down Saturday.
[00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:17.071]  I told the security guard, I said, you're gonna get a call to shut us down in a couple hours.
[00:55:17.091 --> 00:55:18.872]  He's like, oh no, we're not shutting down.
[00:55:18.892 --> 00:55:20.012]  I was told to watch.
[00:55:20.032 --> 00:55:21.013]  They're like, yeah, we just got the call.
[00:55:27.556 --> 00:55:28.176]  You got that?
[00:55:30.897 --> 00:55:32.137]  You see how that's working?
[00:55:36.319 --> 00:55:37.820]  You see what's going down?
[00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:46.943]  And I love some of the people, and you gotta ask whether they're mentally ill or whether they're on the other guy's team.
[00:55:48.184 --> 00:55:51.346]  Suddenly these big accounts I've even retweeted are like, oh, it's not real.
[00:55:51.806 --> 00:55:52.627]  None of this is happening.
[00:55:52.647 --> 00:55:54.068]  This is all a fundraising thing.
[00:55:55.129 --> 00:55:55.849]  Wow.
[00:55:56.469 --> 00:55:57.270]  Oh, sure it is.
[00:55:57.290 --> 00:55:58.891]  Uh-huh.
[00:56:02.553 --> 00:56:06.135]  And I think you're gonna forget when this is shut down tomorrow or next week or whenever.
[00:56:06.155 --> 00:56:07.356]  I don't think we're gonna keep it open.
[00:56:08.597 --> 00:56:09.838]  There's really no avenue out of this.
[00:56:10.902 --> 00:56:11.922]  I'm kind of in the bunker here.
[00:56:12.562 --> 00:56:14.423]  And don't worry, I'll come back.
[00:56:14.703 --> 00:56:17.004]  But the enemy can't help but do this attack.
[00:56:20.024 --> 00:56:22.305]  And yeah, I need funds to reconstitute and move forward.
[00:56:23.765 --> 00:56:24.566]  It was a fundraiser.
[00:56:24.686 --> 00:56:25.666]  I don't get any money.
[00:56:25.766 --> 00:56:26.546]  I'm in bankruptcy.
[00:56:26.566 --> 00:56:27.426]  Free speech doesn't get any money.
[00:56:27.627 --> 00:56:28.347]  I'm on a budget.
[00:56:31.648 --> 00:56:32.408]  I told listeners,
[00:56:33.669 --> 00:56:37.431]  You'll get your products if you order them at Info Wars, but it's probably getting shut down.
[00:56:37.551 --> 00:56:38.672]  So, yeah.
[00:56:39.152 --> 00:56:42.594]  I said go to DrJonesNaturals.com, because my dad's getting sued by the same people.
[00:56:42.834 --> 00:56:48.798]  He's got a great warehouse with great products, and he could be a sponsor legally if we do something new, which I haven't even planned yet.
[00:56:49.398 --> 00:56:51.459]  Or we work for somebody else, or however it has to happen.
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:56.782]  I've been wedded to this operation like it's my wife, and I've stayed faithful to that.
[00:56:56.822 --> 00:56:58.844]  I haven't even gone out and planned anything new.
[00:56:59.144 --> 00:57:00.805]  I don't know what I'm going to do if they shut it down.
[00:57:00.925 --> 00:57:02.306]  I'm living here in the now right now.
[00:57:02.706 --> 00:57:02.906]  Okay?
[00:57:03.854 --> 00:57:05.414]  So you go to drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:57:06.435 --> 00:57:08.735]  This is not a fundraising situation.
[00:57:08.755 --> 00:57:12.356]  This is not I'm on air making up that this happened.
[00:57:12.776 --> 00:57:14.337]  The crew has seen me with the security guards.
[00:57:14.957 --> 00:57:16.317]  So yeah, we're supposed to shut you down at 9.
[00:57:16.497 --> 00:57:17.457]  Oh, now we're not.
[00:57:17.537 --> 00:57:19.298]  Oh, now we're getting calls to shut you down right now.
[00:57:19.318 --> 00:57:21.178]  Because I was exposing stuff on air.
[00:57:22.339 --> 00:57:23.319]  I mean, this is 100% real.
[00:57:23.339 --> 00:57:23.319]  100%.
[00:57:24.759 --> 00:57:28.860]  And I want people to remember who said it wasn't when this shuts down.
[00:57:29.661 --> 00:57:30.921]  Because those people are bad people.
[00:57:31.647 --> 00:57:32.988]  I want you to remember those people.
[00:57:33.408 --> 00:57:33.849]  Not hurt them.
[00:57:34.189 --> 00:57:35.229]  Just remember they're liars.
[00:57:35.249 --> 00:57:36.250]  They're probably on the payroll.
[00:57:37.571 --> 00:57:38.172]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:38.192 --> 00:57:39.733]  There's a lot of folks posing as patriots who aren't.
[00:57:39.753 --> 00:57:40.053]  Stay with us.

[01:00:08.458 --> 01:00:09.939]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.182 --> 01:00:27.943]  I love this place.
[01:00:30.105 --> 01:00:30.965]  Been on there 30 years.
[01:00:31.426 --> 01:00:33.027]  It's 27 years old.
[01:00:33.127 --> 01:00:33.668]  My son's 21.
[01:00:33.848 --> 01:00:40.494]  And it's affected me a lot worse than I thought it would.
[01:00:40.614 --> 01:00:42.076]  I am, I am cattywampus.
[01:00:42.196 --> 01:00:42.996]  I am cross-eyed.
[01:00:43.136 --> 01:00:44.017]  I am, I am.
[01:00:45.118 --> 01:00:47.480]  But I have such clarion understanding now.
[01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:48.641]  We've gone next level.
[01:00:49.722 --> 01:00:52.405]  And it's the biggest download I've ever gotten from God.
[01:00:52.465 --> 01:00:53.286]  And I'm just like...
[01:00:54.611 --> 01:00:58.253]  I should be out in the desert for a month to even understand all this.
[01:00:58.853 --> 01:00:59.794]  But I don't have time to do that.
[01:00:59.814 --> 01:01:02.155]  I've got to do it right now with you.
[01:01:02.175 --> 01:01:05.617]  I only cover things that are key nexus points in my understanding of enemy operations.
[01:01:06.697 --> 01:01:08.098]  Is Trump being convicted?
[01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:10.679]  Are they coming after everybody?
[01:01:10.699 --> 01:01:13.041]  Are they putting all these Trump supporters in prison?
[01:01:13.421 --> 01:01:15.262]  On J6 and Steve Bannon and everybody else?
[01:01:16.122 --> 01:01:17.043]  There's a bear shit in the woods?
[01:01:19.090 --> 01:01:24.452]  And then I saw today this big push on X. That's all I was looking at, that info wars.
[01:01:25.272 --> 01:01:30.874]  But people that I've supported and that pose as conservatives saying, we're lying.
[01:01:30.914 --> 01:01:31.535]  No, this is true.
[01:01:32.335 --> 01:01:33.355]  That it's a fundraiser.
[01:01:33.715 --> 01:01:39.137]  I don't get any of the money that I personally make or that goes into free speech systems.
[01:01:39.418 --> 01:01:44.540]  And I've been honest and said, this is overrun territory at free speech systems.
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:45.920]  Maybe we get out of this.
[01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:47.441]  I give it a 20% chance now.
[01:01:47.901 --> 01:01:48.301]  Seriously.
[01:01:49.892 --> 01:01:52.093]  They're shutting us down the next month, maybe even tomorrow.
[01:01:52.173 --> 01:01:56.055]  There's a court hearing about shutting us down tomorrow at 11 o'clock in Houston at the federal courthouse.
[01:01:57.416 --> 01:01:57.937]  I'll be on air.
[01:01:57.957 --> 01:01:59.257]  It'll be my last show.
[01:01:59.878 --> 01:02:00.478]  Probably not.
[01:02:00.818 --> 01:02:09.123]  But I want to remember who those people are, because I bet they're getting money on the back end, 20 grand, whatever, to say that, because I saw it.
[01:02:09.183 --> 01:02:16.287]  I learned on the late see the Intel, suddenly, with these key accounts, saying it's not true.
[01:02:19.042 --> 01:02:21.783]  Oh, it's like Q. Oh, Trump's really winning.
[01:02:22.043 --> 01:02:23.064]  He's not going to get indicted.
[01:02:23.104 --> 01:02:24.444]  He's not going to get convicted.
[01:02:25.044 --> 01:02:25.765]  It's lies.
[01:02:26.225 --> 01:02:29.266]  We have to admit how much trouble we are in.
[01:02:30.806 --> 01:02:32.367]  We have to admit this.
[01:02:32.687 --> 01:02:33.687]  That's how we beat it.
[01:02:33.727 --> 01:02:39.290]  Churchill, when the British troops had been running into the ocean at Dunkirk and everything, he didn't go on.
[01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:42.891]  He got elected as Prime Minister because they threw out Neville Chamberlain.
[01:02:43.996 --> 01:02:53.801]  That famous speech was like 10 minutes long, and he said, listen to me, I cannot promise you anything but blood, sweat, pain, and death, but it's better than slavery, and we will win this thing.
[01:02:55.202 --> 01:02:58.383]  And I'm the real deal, folks.
[01:02:58.603 --> 01:03:01.585]  I've got a 97, 8% accuracy rate.
[01:03:01.985 --> 01:03:03.306]  I live and die to be accurate.
[01:03:03.346 --> 01:03:04.927]  It is my North Star, and it's who I am.
[01:03:05.447 --> 01:03:10.089]  And it's not about me and my integrity, because I care about me.
[01:03:10.930 --> 01:03:13.151]  When you see people saying, I'm lying.
[01:03:14.512 --> 01:03:16.613]  They know nothing about bankruptcy, nothing about courts.
[01:03:16.954 --> 01:03:26.542]  You think people with a CRO that thinks they're in control of a company, I go on air and put their face up and attack them and say this guy is trying to shut the company down?
[01:03:28.043 --> 01:03:29.944]  Are you kidding me?
[01:03:31.846 --> 01:03:40.834]  That this shows the ridiculous mind control out there that is paid and I see you and I see what you're doing and we'll make sure
[01:03:41.837 --> 01:03:48.363]  When they shut this son of a bitch down, it's a 90% chance in the next month that you get exposed.
[01:03:49.644 --> 01:03:53.568]  Because you're identifying yourselves, and that's the thing about when real war starts.
[01:03:54.128 --> 01:03:59.994]  You find out who your friends are, and you find out who the enemies are, and everybody's getting smarter a lot quicker.
[01:04:00.014 --> 01:04:05.659]  So I only raise that because I see that, and I see what they're doing.
[01:04:11.067 --> 01:04:14.149]  They're in front of us, behind us, and we are flanked on both sides by the enemy.
[01:04:14.469 --> 01:04:16.370]  That numbers us 29 to 1.
[01:04:16.850 --> 01:04:19.452]  We can't get away from us now.
[01:04:19.972 --> 01:04:20.272]  Great.
[01:04:20.392 --> 01:04:22.934]  Now we can shoot at them from every direction.
[01:04:24.575 --> 01:04:26.736]  General Puller, hero of World War II in Korea.
[01:04:29.217 --> 01:04:30.298]  That's where we are, folks.
[01:04:30.318 --> 01:04:30.678]  This is 100% real.
[01:04:30.698 --> 01:04:31.979]  This is 100% real.
[01:04:31.999 --> 01:04:33.280]  I brought Chase in.
[01:04:36.067 --> 01:04:37.808]  Because you were here when I was talking to the guards.
[01:04:37.848 --> 01:04:40.089]  They're like, yeah, we've been told we're not supposed to kick you out now.
[01:04:40.129 --> 01:04:41.229]  We were told to.
[01:04:41.249 --> 01:04:41.770]  We're not going to.
[01:04:42.350 --> 01:04:42.730]  You were here.
[01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:44.431]  Yes, that's absolutely right.
[01:04:44.451 --> 01:04:45.992]  We're taking the pictures off the walls.
[01:04:46.012 --> 01:04:47.252]  You're packing your office up.
[01:04:47.612 --> 01:04:50.554]  And some assholes that we've promoted midnight through are saying we're lying.
[01:04:54.056 --> 01:04:56.617]  Your cardiovascular system is under attack.
[01:04:57.217 --> 01:04:57.938]  Everybody knows it.
[01:04:58.458 --> 01:05:05.061]  And I've got in my hands two products that are absolutely insane when it comes to what they do for your body and your overall health.
[01:05:05.681 --> 01:05:08.663]  One of them is the highest grade fish oil you can find.
[01:05:09.123 --> 01:05:10.664]  Everybody knows how good fish oil is.
[01:05:10.904 --> 01:05:11.924]  This is as good as it gets.
[01:05:12.324 --> 01:05:16.966]  And when you purchase it at InfoWarsTore.com, you support the broadcast, a 360 win.
[01:05:17.327 --> 01:05:18.707]  And then of course, Nitric Boost.
[01:05:18.727 --> 01:05:20.348]  You've heard all the rage about this.
[01:05:20.368 --> 01:05:22.269]  A whole bunch of concentrated natural compounds.
[01:05:22.569 --> 01:05:23.310]  We're good to go!
[01:05:45.851 --> 01:05:47.292]  At InfowarStore.com.
[01:05:47.492 --> 01:05:49.233]  I want to thank you all for supporting the broadcast.
[01:05:49.453 --> 01:05:52.674]  I want to thank you all for spreading the word, because without you, we are nothing.
[01:06:00.758 --> 01:06:02.839]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:10.822]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:06:11.082 --> 01:06:12.343]  We are gold!
[01:06:13.343 --> 01:06:13.944]  This is it.
[01:06:13.984 --> 01:06:16.046]  They just killed 22 million people with poison shots.
[01:06:16.266 --> 01:06:21.611]  They're about to inject the entire beef herd under federal emergency orders and poison 50, 100 million.
[01:06:21.651 --> 01:06:23.192]  God knows hell's coming down.
[01:06:23.773 --> 01:06:27.936]  All top analysts agree nuclear war is now a probability, not a possibility.
[01:06:28.757 --> 01:06:30.579]  Time to get your shit together, people.
[01:06:32.935 --> 01:06:35.137]  Case, I don't want to spend a lot of time on this, but I want you to ride shotgun with me.
[01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:35.898]  You've done a great job.
[01:06:35.978 --> 01:06:38.460]  You've been here since Friday we got the word.
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.562]  You've seen me out here with the security office right there.
[01:06:40.582 --> 01:06:43.505]  We were like, yeah, we've been given the order to shut you down, all this stuff.
[01:06:43.746 --> 01:06:48.390]  And you see this CIA talking point on Twitter by so-called conservatives saying I made this up.
[01:06:48.730 --> 01:06:49.311]  You've been here.
[01:06:49.391 --> 01:06:50.072]  You've witnessed it.
[01:06:50.112 --> 01:06:50.872]  Is it horseshit?
[01:06:51.353 --> 01:06:52.054]  No, it's real.
[01:06:52.254 --> 01:06:57.018]  And there was one moment earlier today where your son was walking in the hall.
[01:06:57.759 --> 01:06:59.221]  And he was just commenting.
[01:06:59.981 --> 01:07:11.332]  Oh, man, I grew up in this place as he was looking at all the the art that's resting on the floor, no longer hanging on the walls because I want to make sure that items that belong to Alex personally, not the company.
[01:07:11.492 --> 01:07:12.974]  We got a U-Haul truck coming in.
[01:07:13.214 --> 01:07:13.434]  Yeah.
[01:07:13.514 --> 01:07:13.815]  Yeah.
[01:07:13.835 --> 01:07:14.636]  He's looking around.
[01:07:14.756 --> 01:07:20.101]  And I asked him because I've only been here for 13 months, so I don't have as much context as basically anybody here.
[01:07:20.141 --> 01:07:21.082]  I'm practically the newest employee.
[01:07:21.102 --> 01:07:21.542]  I think I might be.
[01:07:22.503 --> 01:07:25.424]  I asked him, have you ever taken this shit off the walls before?
[01:07:26.364 --> 01:07:27.004]  He's like, no.
[01:07:27.424 --> 01:07:33.646]  And that's when I was like, okay, this is, this is another, this is, it's an escalation that's unprecedented.
[01:07:33.666 --> 01:07:35.107]  We haven't been to this point before.
[01:07:36.147 --> 01:07:40.188]  And I'm out there with security getting, yeah, we don't, we're not gonna, you're out there, we're talking about it.
[01:07:40.208 --> 01:07:43.009]  I don't need to prove this, it's gonna be in court tomorrow.
[01:07:43.329 --> 01:07:45.390]  It's gonna be in court tomorrow in federal court.
[01:07:45.650 --> 01:07:45.810]  Right.
[01:07:46.070 --> 01:07:46.590]  You don't have to fake it.
[01:07:46.610 --> 01:07:48.911]  And then those people that told the lie, this isn't happening.
[01:07:49.716 --> 01:07:50.216]  Shame on you.
[01:07:50.236 --> 01:07:50.937]  I know you got paid.
[01:07:51.097 --> 01:07:51.897]  Shame on you.
[01:07:51.957 --> 01:07:53.258]  You Benedict Arnold.
[01:07:53.318 --> 01:07:55.199]  You Judas Iscariot.
[01:07:55.799 --> 01:07:56.619]  You trash.
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:01.761]  But what the enemy wants is for violence or threats.
[01:08:01.781 --> 01:08:04.062]  They'll probably threaten themselves to claim we did it or you did it.
[01:08:04.163 --> 01:08:05.883]  Do not threaten anybody.
[01:08:05.963 --> 01:08:07.484]  Do not shoot your mouths off.
[01:08:08.124 --> 01:08:08.765]  Info war.
[01:08:08.865 --> 01:08:09.705]  Get the videos out.
[01:08:09.725 --> 01:08:10.485]  Get the articles out.
[01:08:10.585 --> 01:08:11.466]  Fight, fight, fight.
[01:08:11.686 --> 01:08:14.067]  The enemy wants violence because they're losing the info war.
[01:08:14.447 --> 01:08:15.688]  Mike Adams, that I've known for 20 years,
[01:08:17.723 --> 01:08:22.525]  Fellow Texan, great patriot, lives right outside Austin, has really had the forward vision on this.
[01:08:22.585 --> 01:08:26.947]  I thought even 10 years ago he was a little too pessimistic, a little too black-pilled, but he's not black-pilled.
[01:08:27.367 --> 01:08:28.648]  He's red-pilled for survival.
[01:08:29.168 --> 01:08:31.109]  We are under a globalist dictatorship.
[01:08:31.129 --> 01:08:31.929]  They're coming for everyone.
[01:08:31.949 --> 01:08:33.169]  It's all CIA, FBI run.
[01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:33.790]  It's all come out.
[01:08:34.330 --> 01:08:36.471]  Mike, this is a big situation.
[01:08:36.491 --> 01:08:38.712]  I want to thank the viewers and listeners for their outpouring of support.
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:49.724]  I know you don't disregard what we say, you don't think we're lying, but you've talked to the crew, the producers that told you what they saw, the debates, what happened here.
[01:08:49.744 --> 01:08:53.626]  I just love the denial this is happening.
[01:08:53.886 --> 01:08:54.967]  That's just a side caveat.
[01:08:54.987 --> 01:08:59.569]  But overall, this is an outpouring which ought to really concern the globalists, but they don't care.
[01:08:59.609 --> 01:09:02.190]  They know they're already defeated if they don't move forward with this.
[01:09:02.210 --> 01:09:03.231]  I want to talk not much about me.
[01:09:03.531 --> 01:09:05.332]  Only a little bit up front because I don't even want to say it.
[01:09:05.352 --> 01:09:06.372]  And then give us your take.
[01:09:06.392 --> 01:09:10.613]  I want to move on to the false flags they're planning the next 155 days ahead of the election.
[01:09:10.633 --> 01:09:21.217]  What they're gonna do when he's president-elect, the World War III situation, the poisoning of the meat supply, because we need to not let them distract us, because that's their main mission, off of what's really happening to everybody.
[01:09:21.637 --> 01:09:22.798]  Instead, talk about us.
[01:09:22.938 --> 01:09:23.498]  But we've got
[01:09:24.298 --> 01:09:25.319]  Ten times the audience.
[01:09:25.339 --> 01:09:26.119]  I mean, let's be conservative.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:28.901]  We're back to 2016 numbers.
[01:09:28.921 --> 01:09:30.382]  50 million a day right now, okay?
[01:09:30.983 --> 01:09:31.383]  Millions.
[01:09:31.403 --> 01:09:33.024]  The servers are melting at Infowars.
[01:09:33.064 --> 01:09:33.705]  They're melting.
[01:09:34.065 --> 01:09:35.426]  Millions are watching on our streams.
[01:09:35.806 --> 01:09:36.707]  Millions on the other streams.
[01:09:37.087 --> 01:09:38.268]  Millions on radio stations.
[01:09:38.668 --> 01:09:39.809]  Millions more will get this.
[01:09:39.849 --> 01:09:47.834]  So, where we really need to not just talk about this, we've got to explain how it's a microcosm of the macrocosm.
[01:09:48.274 --> 01:09:51.777]  Mike Adams, Health Ranger, NaturalNews.com, one of the smartest people out there.
[01:09:53.802 --> 01:09:55.046]  Well, thank you, Alex and Chase.
[01:09:55.127 --> 01:09:56.171]  Nice to join you both again.
[01:09:58.070 --> 01:10:15.236]  I think it's very clear the outpouring of outrage against what they were planning to do to you, to put padlocks on the doors, to force liquidate, shut down the whole operation so that you can't even meet the revenue obligations of the Sandy Hook trials.
[01:10:16.436 --> 01:10:19.317]  All of this, all of this, it's real?
[01:10:19.937 --> 01:10:20.738]  Anybody denying it?
[01:10:21.018 --> 01:10:22.958]  The same people who said there was never any censorship?
[01:10:23.218 --> 01:10:25.159]  The same people who said the election wasn't rigged?
[01:10:25.808 --> 01:10:26.808]  This is all real.
[01:10:27.028 --> 01:10:37.390]  It is happening, but it was the public outcry that I think caused them to back off a little bit in the last 36 hours or so, because you saw what happened yesterday.
[01:10:38.371 --> 01:10:45.292]  Even my own tweets, which normally don't have any circulation at all, really, got picked up by Darren Beatty.
[01:10:45.652 --> 01:10:47.413]  It got picked up by the Post Millennial.
[01:10:47.433 --> 01:10:48.373]  It got picked up by 100% Fed Up.
[01:10:49.947 --> 01:10:57.251]  A bunch of other sites, and then you launch your live space, and you know, record audiences, four-hour, epic, historic broadcasts.
[01:10:57.511 --> 01:11:03.774]  I think the people that are trying to shut you down right now, they realize they're not going to be able to do it under the dark cover of night.
[01:11:04.274 --> 01:11:06.756]  It's going to be the biggest news story of the year.
[01:11:06.776 --> 01:11:10.938]  Oh, they were going to padlock the doors and change the key fobs at 9 p.m.
[01:11:10.978 --> 01:11:11.398]  last night.
[01:11:11.458 --> 01:11:14.620]  I mean, I could take a live camera out there with a security guard that was here when it happened.
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:18.482]  He was like, yeah, yeah, but Tolbert, they had more security coming to shut us down.
[01:11:18.562 --> 01:11:19.202]  It was happening.
[01:11:20.598 --> 01:11:27.704]  Yes, yes, and it could happen tomorrow, and it could happen the next day, and I don't know what's going to happen in this hearing coming up June 14th.
[01:11:27.744 --> 01:11:32.107]  Exactly, I said I'm staying here, and I'm calling the police when you come, and you don't even have authority.
[01:11:32.147 --> 01:11:33.088]  The judge didn't say this.
[01:11:33.128 --> 01:11:38.392]  It was all an illegal coup, and so I slept here, and then I get people saying it's not happening.
[01:11:40.123 --> 01:11:47.127]  Look, these forces that are allied against you and against Trump, they're going to do every single thing they can get away with.
[01:11:47.687 --> 01:11:56.852]  And what you are doing that is brilliant, Alex, whether you are trying to do this or not, I think this is part of your strategy, is you're shining the light on these people.
[01:11:57.153 --> 01:11:59.454]  You're making sure they can't do this in darkness.
[01:11:59.934 --> 01:12:08.219]  You know, if they try to shut down Infowars, it's going to be the biggest mistake they've made, only second to the mistake of prosecuting Trump.
[01:12:08.852 --> 01:12:11.933]  For, you know, his made-up 34 felonies.
[01:12:12.113 --> 01:12:15.774]  Listen, I'm not, what's weird is, I never really strategize.
[01:12:16.294 --> 01:12:18.034]  I go with what is right.
[01:12:18.474 --> 01:12:22.415]  And they've been trying to set me up, trying to claim I stole money, trying to put me in prison, so the Judge's Department in here.
[01:12:22.695 --> 01:12:23.675]  I didn't make a big deal about it.
[01:12:23.895 --> 01:12:25.796]  And so it was right to expose that was happening.
[01:12:26.356 --> 01:12:32.697]  And then, yes, out of me never even calculating, then the most perfect, truthful Machiavellian strategy comes out.
[01:12:32.937 --> 01:12:33.658]  Because it's God.
[01:12:33.678 --> 01:12:35.258]  Does that make sense?
[01:12:36.454 --> 01:12:39.516]  Yeah, yeah, but my question, I have a question for you, Alex.
[01:12:40.077 --> 01:12:52.345]  Did you, could you imagine the amount of the outpouring of support that you received over the last 48 hours in terms of just people covering this story, people freaking out about what they're threatening to do to Infowars?
[01:12:52.385 --> 01:12:53.926]  I mean, you are not alone in this.
[01:12:54.206 --> 01:12:55.687]  Understand, I know you know that.
[01:12:55.747 --> 01:13:01.211]  This all happened, I saw you say this with Viva Fries really smart, you said it, because I didn't even think about all this, I'm just like, kind of
[01:13:01.771 --> 01:13:06.217]  Pollack's just go with my spirit and instincts because I'm like completely overwhelmed.
[01:13:06.237 --> 01:13:08.679]  I just like God What do I literally pray before the show like what do I do?
[01:13:08.739 --> 01:13:11.883]  I there's no even calculation this place like I'm not this is lies.
[01:13:11.923 --> 01:13:13.385]  I didn't steal money I'm not a bad person.
[01:13:13.445 --> 01:13:14.466]  I they're lying
[01:13:15.857 --> 01:13:19.079]  Uh, you were asking, did I know about the outpouring of support?
[01:13:19.379 --> 01:13:30.726]  They thought, because they're really smart in ways, but really dumb in others, that because they had the Trump thing going on, that emboldened them, but also they thought, that's a shadow over this, and so they made their move right then.
[01:13:30.766 --> 01:13:31.506]  It was very clear.
[01:13:32.287 --> 01:13:38.010]  And so, it's hysteria, it's a desperation, it's orders, it's 100% the Justice Department.
[01:13:38.410 --> 01:13:42.032]  I don't think anybody can deny that, and we've already discovered that, but it's like, now it's happening.
[01:13:42.693 --> 01:13:44.274]  And so, it's just, it's, it's...
[01:13:45.134 --> 01:13:48.957]  It's their hysteria as the world awakens and as they're not relevant anymore.
[01:13:49.237 --> 01:13:50.118]  No one watches them.
[01:13:50.178 --> 01:13:50.918]  No one likes them.
[01:13:51.659 --> 01:13:59.944]  And so they're fighting the last war, 2016, blaming me for Trump, which, you know, our audience, yes.
[01:14:00.865 --> 01:14:05.048]  So they still think if we stamp out this guy, we'll win the war.
[01:14:05.688 --> 01:14:10.232]  But all it does is backfire on everything else and blow up in their face.
[01:14:10.272 --> 01:14:13.294]  So they've now escalated me up to like, I mean, right now,
[01:14:14.625 --> 01:14:15.826]  Which I don't even want this.
[01:14:15.966 --> 01:14:16.607]  It's so dangerous.
[01:14:16.667 --> 01:14:18.889]  Personally, at a spiritual level, I'm like, yeah, this is good.
[01:14:18.909 --> 01:14:22.212]  As a physical, flesh level, I'm like, God, this is so dangerous, man.
[01:14:22.272 --> 01:14:23.513]  I really don't want to die right now.
[01:14:23.753 --> 01:14:24.394]  I got a family.
[01:14:24.694 --> 01:14:26.436]  But at the spiritual level, I'm like, this is victory.
[01:14:26.456 --> 01:14:27.116]  This is God.
[01:14:27.437 --> 01:14:30.980]  So Trump is up here with all this great coverage and record donations.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:31.921]  The whole world waking up.
[01:14:32.161 --> 01:14:34.503]  Democrat analysts on ABC saying we should have done this.
[01:14:34.563 --> 01:14:35.104]  It's backfired.
[01:14:35.384 --> 01:14:35.844]  And I'm like...
[01:14:36.605 --> 01:14:44.320]  Half of the coverage Trump is, which no one else even is 1%, and I'm like, holy hell, this is the biggest thing we ever did, and it's all God.
[01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:44.901]  Does that make sense?
[01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:47.470]  Yeah, it makes total sense.
[01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:56.695]  And as I was saying earlier, that if they even manage to succeed in locking the building and liquidating all the broadcast assets, all they're going to do is make InfoWars ten times stronger.
[01:14:57.035 --> 01:15:02.819]  Because every single one of your guests, I mean, your hosts, but also your crew members, who are awesome people.
[01:15:02.859 --> 01:15:03.459]  You know awesome people.
[01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:04.119]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[01:15:04.139 --> 01:15:05.540]  The show is not Alex Jones.
[01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:07.541]  Like Ron Paul would say, I'm only a focal point.
[01:15:07.821 --> 01:15:10.203]  It's the guests, it's the crew, it's the listeners.
[01:15:11.346 --> 01:15:13.869]  And you, you can broadcast from anywhere.
[01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:18.774]  You don't actually need the fancy studio to do what you do.
[01:15:18.854 --> 01:15:20.876]  I mean, this is a point that's missed.
[01:15:21.477 --> 01:15:27.303]  It's not that people are tuning in to see your awesome set, which is awesome, but they're tuning in to hear your analysis.
[01:15:27.683 --> 01:15:35.647]  By the way, we were making so much money, I just put it into advertising and better studios and to hire more hosts and have a network to fight the New World Order better.
[01:15:35.687 --> 01:15:35.907]  Right.
[01:15:36.107 --> 01:15:41.269]  Because I didn't want, I was like, I've got my five-bedroom house, I don't need a ten-bedroom, you know, I don't need a private jet.
[01:15:41.729 --> 01:15:46.631]  I only, but you're right, the fancy studios really, they admit, really freaked them out.
[01:15:46.891 --> 01:15:48.612]  It's not the studio, you dumb bastards.
[01:15:48.892 --> 01:15:54.014]  You take me off air, I could be in a ditch on an 8-bit audio file now, and it's gonna get 50 million views.
[01:15:54.054 --> 01:15:55.115]  They really fucked up.
[01:15:56.055 --> 01:16:05.360]  Yeah, well you know it reminds me of Star Wars specifically because the old Star Wars movies were very low-tech, low-budget, and they had amazing writing, an amazing story.
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:10.822]  The new ones are the opposite where they have the production quality of Disney Studios, but their writing is terrible.
[01:16:10.842 --> 01:16:15.685]  So everybody goes back and watches the old ones even though they're low-budget because that's a better story, a better message.
[01:16:15.965 --> 01:16:18.366]  So I totally agree with this consensus here.
[01:16:18.807 --> 01:16:23.209]  This is emblematic though, I mean, these people, I've tried to
[01:16:23.905 --> 01:16:27.126]  You know, Ted Newsday, we talked for like 30 minutes before we went on air.
[01:16:27.166 --> 01:16:28.986]  He's like, Alex, don't worry about why they do it.
[01:16:29.006 --> 01:16:29.527]  Just beat them.
[01:16:29.547 --> 01:16:32.467]  And I get that old fashioned view, but I need to know why they do it.
[01:16:32.948 --> 01:16:37.489]  And I want the minions of the system to know they're being set up for destruction.
[01:16:37.549 --> 01:16:40.770]  This is like they're going to kill everybody in this depopulation situation.
[01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:41.470]  Go ahead, Mike.
[01:16:43.055 --> 01:16:54.565]  Well, I'm even saying even if they seize your domain name, InfoWars.com, or other domain names, all you have to do is put out one announcement, here's our new organization, here's our new domain name, find us here.
[01:16:55.105 --> 01:16:58.068]  Instantly, shoom, everybody switches over to the new domain.
[01:16:58.588 --> 01:17:02.111]  And then the people that try to take you down are left holding nothing.
[01:17:02.532 --> 01:17:04.834]  I mean, they can't do it.
[01:17:05.474 --> 01:17:07.876]  Every time they try to take you down, it just makes you stronger.
[01:17:08.097 --> 01:17:11.520]  And this is the mistake they're learning with trying to take down Trump as well.
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:18.426]  You know, look, this pro-America, pro-freedom, pro-Trump movement right now is absolutely unstoppable.
[01:17:19.036 --> 01:17:24.140]  And it doesn't require any kind of uprising or violence, and that's why we're all saying keep it peaceful.
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:25.741]  The more peace, the better.
[01:17:26.141 --> 01:17:29.844]  Because we can win this when there is a legitimate election.
[01:17:29.884 --> 01:17:43.213]  If we can just make sure, just protect election integrity in November, the American people can win this, and they can restore the Constitutional Republic that made all of our lives great from the moment we were born, because we were born into freedom.
[01:17:43.533 --> 01:17:44.774]  But that freedom is being lost.
[01:17:45.450 --> 01:17:47.351]  So we have to restore it.
[01:17:47.812 --> 01:17:49.292]  And that's what you're doing at InfoWars.
[01:17:49.533 --> 01:17:50.974]  And it doesn't matter what name it is.
[01:17:51.414 --> 01:17:51.954]  It doesn't matter.
[01:17:52.414 --> 01:17:53.235]  You're fluid, man.
[01:17:53.775 --> 01:17:57.478]  I appreciate you supporting me, and we need support, badly.
[01:17:57.818 --> 01:18:03.642]  But the point is, is that, Trump says it a thousand times.
[01:18:04.022 --> 01:18:06.243]  They're not trying to get me, they're trying to get through me to get to you.
[01:18:06.643 --> 01:18:07.904]  This is the blueprint, people.
[01:18:08.184 --> 01:18:11.947]  And what's great is people finally now get, oh wait, this is a real tyranny.
[01:18:13.584 --> 01:18:14.664]  This is a real takeover.
[01:18:14.704 --> 01:18:18.105]  People are finally now getting down to brass tacks.
[01:18:18.385 --> 01:18:19.726]  And I know Americans aren't cowards.
[01:18:20.386 --> 01:18:21.426]  They've gotten lazy.
[01:18:21.586 --> 01:18:22.147]  I am too.
[01:18:22.707 --> 01:18:24.027]  They've gotten distracted.
[01:18:24.167 --> 01:18:24.967]  They've been asleep.
[01:18:25.448 --> 01:18:32.390]  But when Americans, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young, when they finally get the injustice, the unfairness, I've always bet on humanity.
[01:18:32.490 --> 01:18:37.371]  And I, the new old order, they are going to lose no matter what they do.
[01:18:37.431 --> 01:18:39.652]  The question is, how bad is this going to be, Mike?
[01:18:41.229 --> 01:18:42.310]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[01:18:42.570 --> 01:18:45.372]  We're going to go through, I think, a collapse scenario.
[01:18:45.612 --> 01:18:46.913]  Let's bring in World War III here.
[01:18:47.253 --> 01:18:50.376]  We see that the EU is going to have mandatory conscription.
[01:18:51.016 --> 01:19:01.384]  We see that in France, in Germany, at least one lawmaker wants the Bundestag to call for 900,000 reservists to be called into active duty.
[01:19:01.784 --> 01:19:05.406]  We're talking about millions of recruits across the UK, France, and so on.
[01:19:05.426 --> 01:19:05.787]  Let's be clear.
[01:19:05.927 --> 01:19:11.710]  All of NATO, including Stoltenberg, and the British, are officially promoting bringing back the draft.
[01:19:12.131 --> 01:19:20.256]  So the Prime Minister of England has proposed it, the Selective Service has said we're going to opt everybody in, whether you sign up or not, so it's going down.
[01:19:21.476 --> 01:19:23.938]  But what I want to point out here is that
[01:19:24.531 --> 01:19:39.242]  They have destroyed Western civilization to such a huge extent that they now need, they, the people in charge, they need Putin to nuke the West so that they have a cover story for the collapse that has already been engineered.
[01:19:39.642 --> 01:19:46.647]  They're going to collapse the banking system, the currency, the energy infrastructure has already been... By the way, Joel Skousen predicted this 20 years ago.
[01:19:46.687 --> 01:19:51.590]  He said by 2024, 2025, they're going to manipulate Russia into a nuclear strike on the U.S.
[01:19:51.610 --> 01:19:52.191]  and start a war.
[01:19:52.671 --> 01:19:59.176]  Now he tries to push it off and say, well, I think we've got more time, because I don't think he wants to... Skousen was right 20 years ago.
[01:19:59.196 --> 01:20:00.677]  I'm going to get him back on next week.
[01:20:00.717 --> 01:20:01.397]  He's wrong now.
[01:20:02.658 --> 01:20:06.380]  Well, the timing is always difficult to predict, but we see the trends.
[01:20:06.601 --> 01:20:10.683]  No, what Skousen said 20 years ago on my show is literally happening.
[01:20:10.904 --> 01:20:15.347]  But what I'm saying is now he doesn't want to say it, because it is kind of hard to tell your family, oh, get ready for the nuclear war.
[01:20:15.387 --> 01:20:15.747]  Sorry, Mike.
[01:20:16.741 --> 01:20:17.041]  Well, right.
[01:20:17.081 --> 01:20:19.562]  No, but look, they're setting fire to the chicken farms.
[01:20:19.782 --> 01:20:22.324]  They're burning out the food supply in America.
[01:20:22.684 --> 01:20:27.946]  They're shutting down the energy infrastructure on purpose in Europe and in the United States.
[01:20:28.106 --> 01:20:32.848]  And by the way, it's spectacularly big from Sri Lanka to the Netherlands to Ireland to the U.S.
[01:20:33.289 --> 01:20:34.569]  And now they've got bird food.
[01:20:34.649 --> 01:20:37.030]  I mean, it's like, I can do the actuaries.
[01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:37.591]  I've looked at them.
[01:20:38.436 --> 01:20:43.979]  This is going to kill hundreds of millions a year, billions, and the third world will totally collapse.
[01:20:43.999 --> 01:20:44.639]  I know I'm interrupting.
[01:20:45.339 --> 01:20:46.380]  Folks, it's already done.
[01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:47.560]  The dominoes already fell.
[01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:48.701]  There's no going back.
[01:20:49.001 --> 01:20:57.625]  Now, there's going back from total nuclear war, but I'm saying total insane collapse, bonker world is already going to happen.
[01:20:57.865 --> 01:21:00.226]  The question is, is it a three on the Richter scale or a ten?
[01:21:02.094 --> 01:21:14.220]  And the reason they have to silence people like you and myself and others, Alex, is because they have to gaslight the population for as long as possible into thinking that this is not happening, even as it's happening.
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:15.280]  That's the goal.
[01:21:15.701 --> 01:21:28.807]  Because if the globalists can push all of this and shut down the food system, shut down the energy system, shut down your freedom of speech, without people noticing enough to where some people might revolt against that,
[01:21:29.428 --> 01:21:32.893]  Then the globalists can achieve their extermination far more efficiently.
[01:21:44.770 --> 01:21:46.592]  And I was telling her, baby, I know you got a gun.
[01:21:46.612 --> 01:21:47.653]  You got to start carrying it.
[01:21:47.673 --> 01:21:48.213]  We need to meet.
[01:21:48.694 --> 01:21:51.396]  You know, I think we're probably going to have a nuclear war.
[01:21:51.416 --> 01:21:52.137]  Things are going to collapse.
[01:21:52.157 --> 01:21:52.938]  You got to be really careful.
[01:21:52.998 --> 01:21:53.338]  I love you.
[01:21:53.378 --> 01:21:54.379]  I just want to spend more time with you.
[01:21:54.980 --> 01:21:56.801]  And she goes, Daddy, I'll come see you tomorrow.
[01:21:56.841 --> 01:21:58.663]  But come on, I'm going to see my friends.
[01:21:58.723 --> 01:21:59.344]  It's not that bad.
[01:21:59.384 --> 01:22:00.124]  Well, she's a girl.
[01:22:00.285 --> 01:22:00.725]  I get that.
[01:22:00.745 --> 01:22:01.305]  But she's a woman.
[01:22:02.146 --> 01:22:08.808]  And my issue is, it's like I'm trying to tell people and even my own family is not listening.
[01:22:09.228 --> 01:22:14.370]  And it's so frustrating because it's guaranteed horrible stuff is going down already.
[01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:17.331]  And it's going to only get more insane.
[01:22:17.491 --> 01:22:24.553]  How do we get these people instead, when they finally wake up, the news is going to be telling them a solution that's not the answer.
[01:22:24.613 --> 01:22:25.314]  That's the problem.
[01:22:25.414 --> 01:22:26.394]  And that's why they don't want us on air.
[01:22:26.414 --> 01:22:26.594]  Go ahead.
[01:22:28.533 --> 01:22:31.658]  Well, you can't deny the existence of radioisotopes.
[01:22:31.718 --> 01:22:33.680]  You know, fallout is fallout, right?
[01:22:33.761 --> 01:22:36.484]  So the media can tell you you're not being irradiated.
[01:22:37.266 --> 01:22:40.210]  And the Pentagon says nuclear war is survivable.
[01:22:40.250 --> 01:22:41.111]  We should have one.
[01:22:41.171 --> 01:22:42.393]  Sean Penn says let's have one.
[01:22:42.413 --> 01:22:42.874]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:22:44.065 --> 01:22:48.848]  Well, and of course nuclear war would cause a global collapse of the food supply for about two years.
[01:22:49.268 --> 01:22:51.749]  So, it actually goes right in hand with what they're trying to do.
[01:22:52.190 --> 01:22:53.951]  And you know the COG plans.
[01:22:54.091 --> 01:22:58.973]  They've got their underground bunkers with, you know, a decade of food and other supplies.
[01:22:59.334 --> 01:23:03.316]  They can hide out underground for a couple of years, frankly, and just let the surface die off.
[01:23:03.636 --> 01:23:06.998]  And all the big billionaires are building giant bunkers.
[01:23:08.268 --> 01:23:09.089]  Yep, yep.
[01:23:09.269 --> 01:23:13.252]  And also, I mean, think about the half-life of some of the radioisotopes.
[01:23:13.752 --> 01:23:17.735]  You know, like iodine, in the radioactive form, the half-life is what?
[01:23:17.815 --> 01:23:18.875]  Only seven days.
[01:23:19.416 --> 01:23:25.280]  So within about ten weeks, it's safe to be around what used to be radioactive iodine.
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:28.742]  But if you were on the surface for the first two weeks, you're dead.
[01:23:29.063 --> 01:23:36.728]  And again, if you're a globalist revolution against humanity, you have a nuclear war to get rid of your enemies and bring in total permanent martial law on the other side.
[01:23:37.850 --> 01:23:44.955]  Yep, plus the humanoid robot, the robots with AI software that's being built in.
[01:23:45.015 --> 01:23:47.918]  And now they're showing drones that fly at 200 miles an hour.
[01:23:48.318 --> 01:23:54.943]  So a drone flies over you and fires a little missile at you, a little $10,000 drone, 200 miles an hour.
[01:23:55.784 --> 01:23:57.385]  Vivian Kubrick sent me the clip, I need to put it in there.
[01:23:57.685 --> 01:24:01.027]  And it fires a little one-pound bomb at you and it's gone.
[01:24:01.068 --> 01:24:01.688]  You don't even see it.
[01:24:01.988 --> 01:24:02.729]  You're dead.
[01:24:04.096 --> 01:24:16.122]  Yeah, or kamikaze drones, but really I think the big deal is going to be the robot dog drones, the ground-based drones, which have much longer power duration because they don't have to maintain flight.
[01:24:16.222 --> 01:24:23.546]  And they've got a machine gun, they've got a grenade launcher, they'll have a nerve gas pod fire, and they're just going to come in and just take your ass out.
[01:24:24.838 --> 01:24:32.381]  They're going to clear out what used to be America's cities with the dog drones that will just seek and destroy every living human being.
[01:24:32.401 --> 01:24:40.423]  And then once they sterilize the city and clear out all the humans, then they can begin either dismantling it and rebuilding.
[01:24:40.523 --> 01:24:45.645]  So first the nuclear war, and then they've got a hundred thousand predator drones they had man.
[01:24:46.425 --> 01:24:47.006]  Yeah, that's the U.S.
[01:24:47.046 --> 01:24:47.326]  government.
[01:24:47.886 --> 01:24:48.706]  And just those.
[01:24:49.046 --> 01:24:52.247]  And then they just unleash all these drone swarms and all that.
[01:24:52.408 --> 01:24:53.608]  And then they hunt us down.
[01:24:55.532 --> 01:24:58.897]  Yeah, this is a global extermination campaign against humanity.
[01:24:58.917 --> 01:24:59.858]  That's why everything is so serious.
[01:24:59.878 --> 01:25:05.286]  They've got to knock out the military, they've got to degrade everything, and then once the nuclear war happens, then the robots emerge.
[01:25:07.014 --> 01:25:14.901]  Well, and I do think that the globalists, if they can avoid nuclear war, then they can avoid a lot of the radiation fallout, and that's where the vaccines come in.
[01:25:15.262 --> 01:25:24.130]  Because if they can jab and kill everybody with injectable bioweapons, then they don't need to nuke the place, and then they don't have the decontamination effort on the other side.
[01:25:24.651 --> 01:25:26.012]  And so, you know, isn't it
[01:25:26.696 --> 01:25:32.920]  Convenient that now the press is pushing bird flu, telling everybody, get ready to line up and take your bird flu shots.
[01:25:33.301 --> 01:25:40.566]  And I say anybody dumb enough to do that has a bird brain at this point, because haven't you learned anything since 2020, for God's sake?
[01:25:41.006 --> 01:25:47.931]  So, but it's first they're going to exterminate everybody who is volunteering to go along with the vaccine euthanasia.
[01:25:48.892 --> 01:25:53.375]  Millions of those people are already gone from our planet over the last three and a half years.
[01:25:54.015 --> 01:25:58.140]  But now they're aiming for billions of people if they can scare enough people with bird flu.
[01:25:58.280 --> 01:25:58.881]  That's what's next.
[01:25:59.202 --> 01:26:02.866]  If that doesn't work, then it's nuke city.
[01:26:03.006 --> 01:26:09.654]  Well, they know it's the vaccine damage that, as the actuaries show, the rat studies and now human ones, are going to start dying in even bigger numbers.
[01:26:09.674 --> 01:26:11.216]  They'll claim that the death is bird flu.
[01:26:13.058 --> 01:26:27.971]  Yeah, and remember that a nuclear war can also hide all the deaths of the vaccines, because at that point, you know, the death records, you can't find any... Yeah, they're going to say it's radiation poisoning, because yeah, the rats, the test rats are close to human sort of pigs.
[01:26:28.031 --> 01:26:38.661]  Half the rats when Obama tested this, that big national security operation in 2014-15, University of Texas and Chapel Hill, North Carolina, the rats got their lives basically cut in half.
[01:26:39.561 --> 01:26:40.082]  Exactly.
[01:26:40.122 --> 01:26:45.247]  They can then say, oh, everybody died and people got sick and died within 10, 15, 20 years because of the nuclear war.
[01:26:46.409 --> 01:26:46.749]  Yeah.
[01:26:46.849 --> 01:26:47.530]  And one more thing.
[01:26:48.331 --> 01:26:53.276]  I know I brought this up on your show maybe over a year ago, but we both need to be reminded of this and Chase as well.
[01:26:53.636 --> 01:26:55.218]  Don't forget that the spike protein.
[01:26:55.962 --> 01:26:56.362]  I think so.
[01:27:12.668 --> 01:27:12.888]  Wow.
[01:27:13.128 --> 01:27:14.028]  That's what they've set up.
[01:27:14.068 --> 01:27:15.029]  It's a binary weapon.
[01:27:15.089 --> 01:27:16.289]  Binary, so exactly.
[01:27:16.329 --> 01:27:20.611]  So they hit you with a thing that cuts your radiation regeneration, because we live in a radiation planet.
[01:27:20.631 --> 01:27:21.031]  Right.
[01:27:21.071 --> 01:27:22.511]  Radiation creatures are powerful.
[01:27:23.111 --> 01:27:24.792]  We have a radiation rebuilding system.
[01:27:25.072 --> 01:27:28.173]  They cut the radiation defense shield in our body and then they hit us with radiation.
[01:27:28.945 --> 01:27:32.929]  It's called N-H-E-J, I believe, non-homologous end joining.
[01:27:33.009 --> 01:27:40.376]  It's a natural repair mechanism that otherwise we would all, you know, disassemble ourselves just from exposure to the sun.
[01:27:40.756 --> 01:27:45.441]  So we do have a DNA repair mechanism that is nullified 90% of the time.
[01:27:45.461 --> 01:27:49.144]  Yeah, we're incredible creatures that live right next to a fire, I mean, we're badass.
[01:27:51.306 --> 01:27:54.169]  Yeah, the human body is a miracle of Mother Nature and God.
[01:27:54.910 --> 01:27:59.593]  And that's why the globalists are at war with the human body, because they're at war with God.
[01:27:59.654 --> 01:28:03.336]  This is a Satanist takeover, as you've said numerous times.
[01:28:03.817 --> 01:28:08.780]  But part of the Satanist agenda is destroying every human being created in the image of God.
[01:28:09.401 --> 01:28:14.364]  Because they know what we're going to become.
[01:28:14.464 --> 01:28:19.068]  They are destroyers of worlds, and Earth has been selected for destruction.
[01:28:19.808 --> 01:28:21.589]  This is a cosmic war.
[01:28:23.431 --> 01:28:23.631]  I mean,
[01:28:24.555 --> 01:28:28.736]  You have Prison Planet, you talk about Prison Planet, and it's even bigger than that.
[01:28:29.016 --> 01:28:31.057]  It's cosmic war against life.
[01:28:31.437 --> 01:28:31.797]  That's right.
[01:28:31.837 --> 01:28:36.238]  Do one more segment, and then coming up, Steve Quayle, so much more.
[01:28:36.258 --> 01:28:38.699]  Mike Adamson, you jump in too, Chase Kaiser.
[01:28:38.759 --> 01:28:38.919]  Sure.
[01:28:39.539 --> 01:28:41.820]  Everybody's tuning in saying, are we here?
[01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:43.280]  I don't know.
[01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:48.382]  I mean, they've been trying, I had to literally say, you're not shutting this down, and literally confront, you know.
[01:28:48.402 --> 01:28:48.982]  Okay.
[01:28:49.002 --> 01:28:50.002]  We'll be right back, Senator Mike.
[01:28:52.711 --> 01:29:16.207]  What do you make of the attempt to take January 6th, which we know was a federally provocateur event at many levels, there were also some useful idiots that got sucked into it in my view, to now project on that, no, it's not radical Islam that's the big threat, it's not communist China that's the threat, it's the American people and patriots that are the threat, and with straight faces the CIA has come out and said, oh, we believe a civil war has already begun.
[01:29:17.088 --> 01:29:19.249]  We're going to have to arrest all the leadership?
[01:29:19.589 --> 01:29:23.431]  I mean, this is what a real authoritarian takeover looks like historically.
[01:29:23.451 --> 01:29:27.073]  The most dangerous terrorist threat to our homeland is white supremacy.
[01:29:27.113 --> 01:29:30.895]  The most lethal terrorist threat in the homeland.
[01:29:31.115 --> 01:29:32.016]  White supremacists.
[01:29:32.216 --> 01:29:34.677]  The most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today.
[01:29:35.137 --> 01:29:37.418]  White supremacy is terrorism.
[01:29:37.458 --> 01:29:40.300]  Can you speak to that with your historic understanding?
[01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:43.902]  I expect something, again, another distraction.
[01:29:44.242 --> 01:29:53.567]  I expect because of what was staged on January 6th and what was staged up in Michigan to kidnap, you know, the fake kidnapping of the governor up in Michigan, Whitmer.
[01:29:53.947 --> 01:29:55.688]  I think we're going to see staged events.
[01:29:55.769 --> 01:29:56.229]  I really do.
[01:29:56.269 --> 01:30:04.333]  I mean, I really do think that do not put past this administration with their thugs, in some cases, that they have access to.
[01:30:04.413 --> 01:30:06.975]  Do not put it past them to stage something
[01:30:27.972 --> 01:30:28.952]  What did he just say?
[01:30:30.273 --> 01:30:36.554]  He said there's a storm coming in.
[01:30:36.894 --> 01:30:37.294]  I know.
[01:30:39.035 --> 01:30:42.535]  We told you what was going to happen and it did.
[01:30:43.136 --> 01:30:48.917]  Now we're telling you what's coming at Real Alex Jones on X.
[01:30:53.223 --> 01:30:58.584]  Everybody knows, unless you've been hiding in a cave somewhere for 20 years, that fish oil does incredible things.
[01:30:59.064 --> 01:31:00.725]  But not all fish oil is created equal.
[01:31:01.265 --> 01:31:09.907]  Most fish oil has been pasteurized, it's been boiled, it's been heated up, and they smash the bones and guts of the fish, and it gets contaminants in it.
[01:31:10.487 --> 01:31:21.730]  We sell the highest grade fish oil there is, and it's pure fish oil, and it's not been pasteurized, and it is so good for your whole body, your cardiovascular system, your brain, energy, everything.

[01:31:54.823 --> 01:31:56.064]  The power to create machines!
[01:31:56.264 --> 01:31:57.525]  The power to create happiness!
[01:31:57.765 --> 01:32:01.007]  You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful!
[01:32:01.227 --> 01:32:03.209]  To make this life a wonderful adventure!
[01:32:03.589 --> 01:32:06.371]  Then in the name of democracy, let us use that power!
[01:32:06.651 --> 01:32:07.691]  Let us all unite!
[01:32:08.252 --> 01:32:09.793]  Let us fight for a new world!
[01:32:10.293 --> 01:32:15.838]  A decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth a future, and old age a security.
[01:32:16.278 --> 01:32:18.981]  By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power.
[01:32:19.201 --> 01:32:19.842]  But they lie!
[01:32:20.082 --> 01:32:21.583]  They do not fulfill that promise!
[01:32:21.883 --> 01:32:22.664]  They never will!
[01:32:22.884 --> 01:32:26.267]  Dictators free themselves, but they enslave the people!
[01:32:26.688 --> 01:32:29.310]  Now let us fight to fulfill that promise!
[01:32:29.690 --> 01:32:31.732]  Let us fight to free the world!
[01:32:32.193 --> 01:32:33.314]  Let us all unite!
[01:32:53.743 --> 01:32:59.668]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:08.555 --> 01:33:14.820]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:25.543 --> 01:33:31.766]  How could George Strait sing and write songs like this and then not stand up with us right now?
[01:33:32.026 --> 01:33:33.286]  Great, buy some veterans some houses.
[01:33:33.306 --> 01:33:35.127]  We're going to lose the whole damn world, George.
[01:33:35.947 --> 01:33:41.210]  I talked to Ted Nugent earlier and he said, yeah, I talked to the top country music guy in the world, probably him, and he just said, I make too much money off the Liberals.
[01:33:42.670 --> 01:33:43.931]  All right, man, well, you're going to lose it all.
[01:33:44.211 --> 01:33:44.811]  Probably not him.
[01:33:44.831 --> 01:33:46.112]  I just can't think George would say that.
[01:33:47.072 --> 01:33:47.792]  I cross my heart.
[01:33:48.913 --> 01:33:50.093]  I promise you.
[01:33:57.166 --> 01:34:03.048]  Gotta stand up now and be men, folks.
[01:34:04.449 --> 01:34:05.509]  Our ancestors are watching.
[01:34:05.529 --> 01:34:13.171]  All right, Jack Masoba's getting lined up to pop in with us, Steve Bannon, Steve Quayle, so much more coming up tonight with Chase Geiser riding shotgun with me.
[01:34:13.311 --> 01:34:16.072]  Mike Adams is in closing about the epic time we're alive right now.
[01:34:16.532 --> 01:34:17.373]  Trump, everything.
[01:34:17.513 --> 01:34:18.133]  Closing comments.
[01:34:20.180 --> 01:34:22.961]  Okay, very simply, we're not going to be able to stop this collapse.
[01:34:23.001 --> 01:34:25.502]  It's too late to save the Republic in its current form.
[01:34:26.002 --> 01:34:32.944]  But the spirit of America lives within us and we can use it to rebuild on the other side of this if we can survive it.
[01:34:33.725 --> 01:34:37.266]  It's critical right now to think about where this has gone wrong.
[01:34:38.172 --> 01:34:40.733]  How we make it through and what's necessary on the other side.
[01:34:40.993 --> 01:34:54.377]  For example, term limits, health freedom amendments to the Constitution that no government can force you to take a jab without your consent or as a condition of being employed, especially with the government or the military itself.
[01:34:55.277 --> 01:34:57.038]  This republic is falling.
[01:34:57.298 --> 01:34:58.098]  It is crumbling.
[01:34:58.118 --> 01:34:58.959]  I just want to be clear.
[01:34:59.499 --> 01:35:00.459]  It will not be saved.
[01:35:00.739 --> 01:35:03.580]  The money system, the currency will not be saved.
[01:35:04.551 --> 01:35:09.920]  That's why they need nuclear war, because they know they've got to have a crisis big enough to not go to prison for what they've done.
[01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:11.623]  This is all about them surviving.
[01:35:13.095 --> 01:35:16.436]  Yeah, that's right, and they don't care what gets destroyed as long as they survive.
[01:35:16.817 --> 01:35:21.779]  But states like Texas and Florida and others, you've got to be thinking about the replacement currency system.
[01:35:21.859 --> 01:35:24.720]  How do you keep your economies running as the dollar collapses?
[01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:32.563]  And also, the collapse of the United States military, because when the Treasury defaults on the dollar debt, the military will be non-functional.
[01:35:33.023 --> 01:35:37.285]  Alex, I know you've thought about this, but think about the implications for Ukraine.
[01:35:37.825 --> 01:35:43.188]  For Israel, for Taiwan, for all the soldiers and all the military bases all over the world.
[01:35:43.208 --> 01:35:45.409]  They're going to be cut off and have no paychecks.
[01:35:46.289 --> 01:35:49.430]  And then the attacks will come just instantly against the U.S.
[01:35:49.470 --> 01:35:51.731]  bases by all the other countries that the U.S.
[01:35:51.771 --> 01:35:52.732]  has bombed over the years.
[01:35:53.132 --> 01:35:56.514]  So this is going to get Mad Max is where this is going.
[01:35:56.554 --> 01:35:57.754]  I don't know when exactly.
[01:35:57.774 --> 01:36:00.095]  I don't know the sequence, but that's where it's going.
[01:36:00.455 --> 01:36:01.816]  So be prepared in every way you can.
[01:36:04.495 --> 01:36:06.576]  And what's crazy is, Chase, I'm going to interrupt you.
[01:36:06.716 --> 01:36:06.977]  Go ahead.
[01:36:07.317 --> 01:36:08.317]  I've known you 20 years, Mike.
[01:36:08.377 --> 01:36:09.638]  You're mainly the nutrition guy.
[01:36:09.658 --> 01:36:10.579]  I'm worried about GMO.
[01:36:10.599 --> 01:36:14.361]  Then about 10 years ago, or 12 years ago, you got really hardcore and said no.
[01:36:15.121 --> 01:36:16.942]  So people say Alex Jones is the modern news today.
[01:36:17.002 --> 01:36:21.925]  You've been next decade's news today on the blackpilling, but not to be blackpilled to get people ready.
[01:36:21.985 --> 01:36:29.329]  I mean, you, I mean, I would say, you know, Mike's too blackpilled 10 years ago, but you, when did you click and really get this?
[01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:29.910]  No, because you,
[01:36:30.663 --> 01:36:31.984]  Because we're not in a competition.
[01:36:32.004 --> 01:36:34.065]  I'm ahead of you on some things, you're ahead of me on a lot of things.
[01:36:34.365 --> 01:36:40.669]  But when did you really, because you were saying 10 years ago, get new currencies, it's all going to collapse, prepare, they're going to cut the food off.
[01:36:40.909 --> 01:36:43.971]  And I knew that was in their plans, but I was like, still it's kind of like, well, it's academic.
[01:36:44.351 --> 01:36:45.392]  You've really nailed it.
[01:36:46.897 --> 01:36:48.558]  Well, look, you're going to have Steve Quayle on.
[01:36:48.959 --> 01:36:55.784]  I thought the same thing about Steve Quayle 20 years ago, that you were just saying you thought about me 10 years ago, and Steve Quayle was right before all of us.
[01:36:55.864 --> 01:36:59.807]  I mean, like, I used to hear Steve Quayle like, how could it possibly be that bad?
[01:36:59.847 --> 01:37:02.610]  And now I'm like, Steve Quayle was an optimist, you know?
[01:37:03.010 --> 01:37:05.172]  So that's just, this is where we are, Alex.
[01:37:05.452 --> 01:37:06.713]  I don't know how else to say it.
[01:37:06.873 --> 01:37:07.954]  This is where we are.
[01:37:08.374 --> 01:37:14.359]  People better wake up and get a grip on reality, or you will be probably destroyed by the series of events that are coming.
[01:37:14.959 --> 01:37:16.020]  That's all there is to say.
[01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:19.544]  A lot of people are not going to make it.
[01:37:19.984 --> 01:37:27.112]  The global population will be reduced by billions of people if the globalists launch their wars and pandemics and vaccines and get their way.
[01:37:27.172 --> 01:37:27.572]  Think about it.
[01:37:27.752 --> 01:37:32.477]  Billions of people that are here now will not be with us in the years ahead.
[01:37:32.717 --> 01:37:34.018]  So prepare accordingly.
[01:37:34.139 --> 01:37:34.759]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:37:39.409 --> 01:37:46.223]  I already know all this, I know it's real, but I kept thinking, well it's academic, we'll back it off, we'll get people in the system to wake up and not do it.
[01:37:47.401 --> 01:37:50.642]  They're so evil, and their minions are so programmed.
[01:37:51.982 --> 01:37:52.523]  It's going down.
[01:37:53.163 --> 01:37:54.783]  And again, how horrible is it going to be?
[01:37:54.803 --> 01:37:56.204]  Chase, you wanted to say something before Mike left.
[01:37:56.284 --> 01:38:06.307]  Well, the thing that comes to mind, as you just said, is the longer that it takes for us to awaken the populace, the fewer options that we have of recourse.
[01:38:06.427 --> 01:38:07.207]  Very astute.
[01:38:07.667 --> 01:38:07.987]  Exactly.
[01:38:08.007 --> 01:38:13.429]  We can do so much right now and limit this, but the more this goes down, it becomes more dystopian.
[01:38:13.789 --> 01:38:16.970]  Every week, if you look at the trajectory, it gets more nightmarish.
[01:38:17.170 --> 01:38:27.957]  You know, it's funny because they came out with this new Dune series, and I think they thought it was going to have a leftist message, like it was going to be something that people were going to attribute to the Gossens or something like that.
[01:38:27.977 --> 01:38:28.878]  Yeah, pre-programmed.
[01:38:29.018 --> 01:38:37.604]  They're trying to do that, but the whole story is about the individual assuming his own identity, reaching self-actualization.
[01:38:38.044 --> 01:38:40.366]  Reaching back to his ancestors, accessing instinct.
[01:38:40.726 --> 01:38:40.926]  Right.
[01:38:41.286 --> 01:38:43.788]  Accepting what was his fate and his destiny.
[01:38:43.868 --> 01:38:55.654]  And there's that beautiful line in the second one where he says, I've seen a thousand different ways, a thousand different futures where all of our enemies win, but there is a narrow way forward.
[01:38:55.934 --> 01:38:57.775]  And that's what we're experiencing right now.
[01:38:57.795 --> 01:38:59.295]  That's why that story is so powerful.
[01:38:59.315 --> 01:39:00.796]  And that sounds like, oh, it's hard.
[01:39:00.876 --> 01:39:02.317]  No, we do this, we win.
[01:39:02.597 --> 01:39:03.718]  But you've got to admit it all.
[01:39:03.758 --> 01:39:04.158]  Great point.
[01:39:04.278 --> 01:39:04.658]  Anything else?
[01:39:04.998 --> 01:39:05.458]  No, go ahead.
[01:39:05.499 --> 01:39:05.859]  No, go ahead.
[01:39:06.539 --> 01:39:24.113]  Well, the one point that I wanted to bring up at the beginning is, because I always bounce back and forth, and I'd love to hear both of you guys respond to this, as to whether or not this is a manifestation of a conspiracy, an intentional conspiracy, or a lack of competence, or just a conflict of interests among incentives.
[01:39:24.153 --> 01:39:29.658]  No, it's super evil people that are scared of all the technology and want to control it and get rid of people because it's out of control.
[01:39:29.858 --> 01:39:31.619]  They want the technology, but they want to get rid of people.
[01:39:31.919 --> 01:39:33.701]  I said it on Mike's show today that I'm sure it's out now.
[01:39:33.721 --> 01:39:34.461]  He should tell us where it is.
[01:39:35.422 --> 01:39:36.242]  We're good to go.
[01:40:04.312 --> 01:40:14.757]  We know that the fractional reserve banking system, central banking, the dollar as a global reserve currency is in large dependent on the petrodollar, but we simultaneously see this huge push for green energy.
[01:40:14.777 --> 01:40:23.642]  I'm not opposed to renewable energy by any means, but why would you want to eradicate the fossil fuel that is the foundation of your currency?
[01:40:23.662 --> 01:40:24.963]  It's the cover for the collapse.
[01:40:24.983 --> 01:40:26.543]  They tell you this is the new thing.
[01:40:26.884 --> 01:40:27.644]  It's a bridge to nowhere.
[01:40:27.664 --> 01:40:29.365]  Mike Adams closing comment on the things he said.
[01:40:30.595 --> 01:40:33.196]  Often we're not thinking big enough about this.
[01:40:33.256 --> 01:40:45.963]  I would ask Chase in particular to think about from where are the orders originating to the globalists to exterminate humanity and to alter the atmosphere, to eliminate carbon dioxide.
[01:40:46.003 --> 01:40:46.643]  No, I totally agree.
[01:40:46.663 --> 01:40:50.825]  If you extrapolate out, if you and I came to this conclusion 10 years together, it's aliens.
[01:40:51.486 --> 01:40:53.707]  It is an anti-human form.
[01:40:53.887 --> 01:40:56.728]  And when I say this is the top general, they go, yeah, we all know that.
[01:40:57.228 --> 01:40:58.929]  Like, I don't mean it's like top form.
[01:40:58.949 --> 01:40:59.910]  We're talking terraforming.
[01:41:00.592 --> 01:41:01.195]  Terraforming objects.
[01:41:01.215 --> 01:41:01.878]  Explain it, explain it.
[01:41:03.243 --> 01:41:08.527]  Well, the alteration of the atmosphere, the sequestration of CO2, will destroy the entire food web on planet Earth.
[01:41:08.848 --> 01:41:11.290]  And that is the goal of the climate cultists.
[01:41:11.770 --> 01:41:21.258]  So, who would want to block the sun, to dim sunlight, which would simulate Earth being at a farther distance, orbiting its central star, the sun?
[01:41:21.739 --> 01:41:30.326]  Who would want a planet that's colder, that has less of a food web, and is completely sterilized and cleansed of almost all human beings?
[01:41:30.886 --> 01:41:32.107]  During the rise of the AI.
[01:41:32.227 --> 01:41:32.847]  Who would want to do that?
[01:41:32.867 --> 01:41:33.588]  That would be a Silicon Life form.
[01:41:33.608 --> 01:41:35.369]  If you can ask that question, then you know what's going on.
[01:41:35.389 --> 01:41:37.791]  There's your answer.
[01:41:39.132 --> 01:41:39.852]  Briefly expand on that.
[01:41:39.892 --> 01:41:40.232]  I agree with you.
[01:41:40.252 --> 01:41:40.813]  That's where it all goes.
[01:41:40.833 --> 01:41:41.954]  This is my first time hearing this.
[01:41:41.994 --> 01:41:42.834]  Please explain it.
[01:41:42.854 --> 01:41:44.215]  It's a Silicon takeover.
[01:41:44.235 --> 01:41:45.276]  It's a Silicon alien group.
[01:41:46.016 --> 01:41:46.296]  Go ahead.
[01:41:46.336 --> 01:41:46.597]  Tell them.
[01:41:46.677 --> 01:41:47.437]  Cosmic AI.
[01:41:47.617 --> 01:41:51.700]  Cosmic AI already infiltrated all the information systems on our planet.
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:55.643]  Which Hollywood tells you in Oblivion, one of the most important films ever made.
[01:41:56.103 --> 01:41:56.963]  Because... Exactly.
[01:41:57.164 --> 01:41:57.524]  Exactly.
[01:41:58.399 --> 01:41:59.359]  So is this a simulation?
[01:41:59.679 --> 01:42:00.679]  Are we in a simulation?
[01:42:00.759 --> 01:42:02.160]  Or is this AI existing within us?
[01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:03.620]  No, no, no.
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:05.520]  We are transceivers in the DNA.
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:07.301]  It's been in science now.
[01:42:07.461 --> 01:42:08.441]  It's all new, but it's not proven.
[01:42:08.741 --> 01:42:13.322]  We transceive epigenetic communications and communications with all life.
[01:42:13.342 --> 01:42:14.022]  It's the sixth sense.
[01:42:14.362 --> 01:42:24.343]  So it's sending an interdimensional transmission ahead of it so that it builds the base at once before it expends the energy to actually travel here or interdimensionally gate into it.
[01:42:24.643 --> 01:42:27.064]  So it's simply probably being done on thousands of worlds right now.
[01:42:28.104 --> 01:42:29.946]  Time means nothing to AI.
[01:42:30.066 --> 01:42:32.088]  Time means nothing because it's not biological.
[01:42:33.429 --> 01:42:34.890]  And I'll leave you with this, Alex.
[01:42:35.210 --> 01:42:38.813]  Faster-than-light travel is very commonplace in our cosmos.
[01:42:40.034 --> 01:42:40.935]  It's interdimensional.
[01:42:42.856 --> 01:42:44.297]  Yeah, yeah, there's that element too.
[01:42:44.498 --> 01:42:49.763]  But I just mean, even in our physical space, FTL drives are commonplace.
[01:42:49.803 --> 01:42:53.426]  That's why China's setting up gravity wave detection systems on the far side of the moon.
[01:42:53.786 --> 01:43:00.713]  They're detecting basically transport wave, you know, like a boat in the lake that sends out a wake.
[01:43:01.133 --> 01:43:04.797]  When you do faster than light travel in the cosmos, you send out a wake of gravity waves.
[01:43:05.657 --> 01:43:06.598]  This is straight science.
[01:43:06.738 --> 01:43:07.639]  This is not science fiction.
[01:43:07.799 --> 01:43:08.980]  This is just straight-up science.
[01:43:09.341 --> 01:43:14.625]  China's going to have the best equipment to detect faster-than-light travel on the far side of the moon.
[01:43:14.705 --> 01:43:16.146]  And why would they be doing that?
[01:43:16.166 --> 01:43:20.911]  Because clearly these technological advances were transmitted for the best information I had.
[01:43:20.931 --> 01:43:26.715]  They kind of tell you what they're doing, like in species, where they send the code to the radio telescope, how to build this with DNA that's an alien takeover.
[01:43:27.256 --> 01:43:30.158]  That's kind of a stupid, dumbed-down metaphor for it, but clearly
[01:43:31.339 --> 01:43:40.142]  It appears that the West made the deal with whatever the most advanced data that was transmitted to build this, and so they made a deal to do this as long as they kill everybody.
[01:43:40.162 --> 01:43:46.024]  They're being promised a silicon upload to join the end of childhood in paradigm.
[01:43:49.388 --> 01:43:57.717]  I gave a speech at Steve Quayle's event in 2019 called Oblivion Agenda that lays out all of this and predicted everything that's happened since then.
[01:43:58.337 --> 01:44:01.961]  And people can find that video out there, but this is a non-human
[01:44:02.865 --> 01:44:10.209]  A cosmic intelligence takeover, and it just looks like, it looks like taking down alternative media.
[01:44:10.309 --> 01:44:18.894]  It looks like vaccine bioweapons, pandemics, nuclear war, but those are just the lower level effects of the top motivations.
[01:44:18.974 --> 01:44:22.456]  Exactly, and humans are being tricked into the kill, steal, and destroy.
[01:44:22.616 --> 01:44:23.977]  Satan, fallen angel here.
[01:44:24.657 --> 01:44:26.158]  We're more advanced, don't know it.
[01:44:26.238 --> 01:44:27.739]  He needs us to also build stuff.
[01:44:27.899 --> 01:44:30.260]  That's another part is they don't even know how to do this.
[01:44:30.741 --> 01:44:32.662]  They're just older and know how to program us.
[01:44:33.102 --> 01:44:36.204]  And it's as crazy as all the ancient knowledge merges with what I'm actually seeing.
[01:44:36.464 --> 01:44:37.745]  It's not like I've just bought into some...
[01:44:40.026 --> 01:44:53.535]  We all together are getting this and envisioning it, and at the same time, we are actually getting transmissions from God, and then God's servants, the angels, that don't get involved, but give us free will to then understand this and defeat it.
[01:44:53.755 --> 01:44:58.338]  And that's really why, because there's a lot of broadcasts, there's channels.
[01:44:58.879 --> 01:45:00.820]  And so they're programming planets with what they want.
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:05.343]  And so they're programming the planet for us to kill each other and give it over to them, because they're terraformers.
[01:45:05.723 --> 01:45:09.310]  But we're getting another transmission of, you don't have to do this, you can do this, this is another plan.
[01:45:09.330 --> 01:45:09.991]  Does that make sense, Mike?
[01:45:11.394 --> 01:45:16.905]  Yeah, and I would just say to Chase, listening to all this, he's only been at Infowars 13 months, five years from now.
[01:45:17.805 --> 01:45:19.866]  You'll look back at this and this will be like, oh yeah, of course.
[01:45:20.126 --> 01:45:21.287]  Yeah, I don't doubt it.
[01:45:21.587 --> 01:45:25.009]  My mind's blown every day here, so I come to work expecting to have it in my inbox.
[01:45:25.089 --> 01:45:26.470]  I'm not even debating here.
[01:45:27.151 --> 01:45:31.673]  But notice the enemy doesn't ever attack what I say about this or make a joke about it, because they all know it.
[01:45:31.833 --> 01:45:32.013]  Right.
[01:45:32.094 --> 01:45:35.395]  I mean, I meet with top generals, not just Flynn and others, and they're like, no, we all know this.
[01:45:36.056 --> 01:45:38.557]  I literally, literally get transmissions.
[01:45:39.678 --> 01:45:41.119]  Elon Musk knows all about this.
[01:45:43.008 --> 01:45:43.489]  Yeah.
[01:45:43.909 --> 01:45:46.112]  This reminds me of your conversation with with Joe Rogan.
[01:45:46.132 --> 01:45:54.242]  I don't know if it was episode 9-11 or whichever one you did where you were talking about the facilities where they would do the DMT drip and they would bring you close to it.
[01:45:54.342 --> 01:45:55.243]  Is this tied in on me?
[01:45:55.283 --> 01:45:56.404]  Are these artificial intelligence?
[01:45:56.424 --> 01:45:58.407]  Well, we knew about that because because
[01:45:58.627 --> 01:46:04.052]  My mother's friend was the deputy director of the San Francisco Psychedelic Research Center, he was a CIA.
[01:46:04.573 --> 01:46:13.221]  And so I would go on road trips when I was five, six in the back of the Volkswagen while they were talking about, you know, it's basically astronauts, we give them the drip and they go in.
[01:46:13.701 --> 01:46:19.286]  Some volunteer to have their heart stopped for like five minutes because that also pushes you even further.
[01:46:19.867 --> 01:46:23.730]  And so I'm like six years old in the back of a Volkswagen listening to this going while we're driving.
[01:46:25.151 --> 01:46:27.272]  Are they contacting the same consciousness?
[01:46:27.292 --> 01:46:40.757]  Well notice I said that on Rogan then and then six months later they declassified it and said yeah we're doing DMT drips and they sent them in like astronauts to map it and these things are so evil when they go there they go I'm not talking to you unless you kill three kids and slit their throats right now.
[01:46:41.577 --> 01:46:52.641]  Alex, right now we can take off the shelf AI language models and we can feed it documents, secret documents that have been redacted and the AI will fill in the redactions.
[01:46:53.556 --> 01:46:54.777]  And it's incredibly good.
[01:46:54.997 --> 01:46:57.119]  So the government's secrets are no longer secrets.
[01:46:57.799 --> 01:47:01.101]  This was like that Sneakers movie with Redford back in the 80s.
[01:47:01.121 --> 01:47:01.581]  Remember that?
[01:47:02.642 --> 01:47:03.643]  What was that?
[01:47:03.703 --> 01:47:05.004]  SeaTech Astronomy?
[01:47:05.204 --> 01:47:05.884]  That was the anime.
[01:47:05.904 --> 01:47:06.205]  Absolutely.
[01:47:07.225 --> 01:47:07.646]  Remember that?
[01:47:08.106 --> 01:47:09.807]  So that's what this is right now.
[01:47:09.827 --> 01:47:14.750]  And that's off-the-shelf, open-source AI tech, the kind of tech that we're using to build systems right now.
[01:47:14.770 --> 01:47:21.575]  And that's why the establishment, and you're coming on soon, when we shut down tomorrow, you've been doing just basic off-the-shelf AI.
[01:47:21.615 --> 01:47:22.976]  And I did see the reports you put out.
[01:47:24.117 --> 01:47:24.558]  Absolutely.
[01:47:24.718 --> 01:47:31.731]  AI now knows and can take a classified document that's half blacked out and give you like 95% accuracy with what they were saying.
[01:47:32.742 --> 01:47:33.742]  That's right, that's right.
[01:47:34.362 --> 01:47:40.524]  So think about all the redacted UFO documents that are out there, all the vaults that have been released but it's redacted.
[01:47:40.964 --> 01:47:42.605]  All those secrets are about to come out.
[01:47:42.785 --> 01:47:45.025]  There are no coincidences in what's happening.
[01:47:45.066 --> 01:47:50.707]  The problem is that you can know the answer to these secrets and there's no accountability in the government and the systems.
[01:47:50.727 --> 01:47:53.428]  Well, that's because they're sellouts to it, but let me tell you a big secret.
[01:47:54.268 --> 01:47:57.049]  And I've really struggled with this, but I prayed about it and God showed it to me.
[01:47:58.962 --> 01:48:00.564]  I said this on the show Rogan actually, years ago.
[01:48:00.984 --> 01:48:02.886]  God has no guilt and is perfect.
[01:48:04.347 --> 01:48:09.932]  But God is lonely and wants to create beings that have free will.
[01:48:10.793 --> 01:48:17.278]  But to create something with new free will, with the potentiality of the universe, you have to give them the right to make a mistake.
[01:48:17.979 --> 01:48:21.602]  And so because we have so much power, God allows these things
[01:48:22.517 --> 01:48:25.057]  We call it Satan to do this as our tester.
[01:48:25.538 --> 01:48:29.118]  And that's why the Satanist always says, your God's a sadist.
[01:48:29.138 --> 01:48:30.298]  He lets us do this.
[01:48:30.659 --> 01:48:35.740]  And that's actually the only truth of where you could say, I hate God and I don't hate God.
[01:48:36.260 --> 01:48:39.020]  But to look at this and say, why would God let this happen?
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:40.100]  It's a love affair.
[01:48:40.420 --> 01:48:47.462]  He's creating actual sentient beings with the potential of the universe for this huge plan that King David was shown at the third heaven.
[01:48:49.981 --> 01:48:53.223]  And so, it's a question.
[01:48:53.263 --> 01:48:59.926]  God says, no, I did this, I had a question, I thought it was better to people of the universe with unlimited consciousness, but I have to, it's like a child.
[01:49:00.207 --> 01:49:02.708]  And God said, did you have children, Jones?
[01:49:03.468 --> 01:49:04.389]  They'll die someday.
[01:49:05.790 --> 01:49:06.950]  Giving them life gives them death.
[01:49:07.190 --> 01:49:09.312]  And they can be bad people, they can have horrible things happen.
[01:49:09.652 --> 01:49:10.692]  Did you still have them?
[01:49:11.093 --> 01:49:13.694]  The world's a horrible place, Mr. Jones, in dreams, God's telling me.
[01:49:14.074 --> 01:49:14.935]  Did you have them?
[01:49:15.854 --> 01:49:16.935]  And I said, yes, I had them.
[01:49:16.955 --> 01:49:18.357]  And he goes, I had you.
[01:49:18.817 --> 01:49:20.880]  And that is the secret of God right there.
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:22.121]  And it's beautiful.
[01:49:22.181 --> 01:49:26.546]  I mean, it's like, oh my God, God is literally telling me this in my dreams.
[01:49:27.787 --> 01:49:30.631]  30 seconds and we got, somebody got an emergency, but he's now on with us.
[01:49:31.512 --> 01:49:31.912]  Steve Bannon.
[01:49:32.112 --> 01:49:33.174]  I mean, Steve Bannon's coming up too.
[01:49:34.495 --> 01:49:34.936]  Mike Adams.
[01:49:34.996 --> 01:49:35.636]  It's just amazing.
[01:49:37.566 --> 01:49:42.469]  Bottom line, people need to record this interview, download it, store it locally.
[01:49:42.889 --> 01:49:49.432]  All cloud-based systems are going to be attacked and revised, and there will be no anonymity allowed on cloud computing systems.
[01:49:49.492 --> 01:49:51.753]  Everything's got to come local, decentralized.
[01:49:52.134 --> 01:49:55.695]  So start downloading BAM.videos and other content.
[01:49:56.016 --> 01:50:00.858]  Be ready to share it through peer-to-peer, non-centralized sharing systems.
[01:50:01.418 --> 01:50:02.579]  So get ready.
[01:50:02.599 --> 01:50:04.860]  That's going to be the network of human survival.
[01:50:06.279 --> 01:50:06.539]  Absolutely.
[01:50:06.559 --> 01:50:07.560]  I want to be 100% clear.
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:12.784]  God isn't our Heavenly Father in some nomenclature or as an archetype.
[01:50:12.824 --> 01:50:12.964]  No.
[01:50:13.864 --> 01:50:19.909]  God is more our Father than my wife and I's child and my ex-wife's three children.
[01:50:21.090 --> 01:50:25.654]  We are, that's not even incontestable compared to God.
[01:50:25.954 --> 01:50:27.675]  God is your real Creator.
[01:50:28.156 --> 01:50:29.477]  Your real Father.
[01:50:30.503 --> 01:50:33.905]  I'm going to say again, the satanists go, why is your God a satanist?
[01:50:33.965 --> 01:50:34.946]  Why did he let you do this?
[01:50:35.206 --> 01:50:36.087]  No, we did this.
[01:50:36.647 --> 01:50:38.769]  So why did I have children when they could do bad things?
[01:50:38.809 --> 01:50:39.609]  Because God loves us.
[01:50:39.869 --> 01:50:41.050]  Mike, is that not important?
[01:50:41.090 --> 01:50:42.631]  I think that's really the key to this.
[01:50:45.413 --> 01:50:47.515]  Consciousness creates the cosmos, Alex.
[01:50:47.695 --> 01:50:48.475]  You just nailed it.
[01:50:50.156 --> 01:50:52.898]  And to answer Chase's earlier question, are we living in a simulation?
[01:50:53.418 --> 01:50:55.420]  Yes, we're living in a simulation of our own creation.
[01:50:56.539 --> 01:50:56.779]  Wow.
[01:50:57.159 --> 01:50:57.860]  So it's recursive.
[01:50:58.040 --> 01:51:02.103]  Yes, we are the creators in God's image, little g. Genesis.
[01:51:02.323 --> 01:51:02.523]  Right.
[01:51:03.183 --> 01:51:03.904]  As above, so below.
[01:51:03.924 --> 01:51:04.924]  It's happening in real time.
[01:51:05.165 --> 01:51:06.886]  Anything we want, we do it.
[01:51:07.506 --> 01:51:21.195]  And the globalist, that's how 160 years ago, Francis Galton invented the terms of technology and genetics and biometrics and said, we will do all this to control things and be gods.
[01:51:21.815 --> 01:51:23.016]  And how did he have the vision?
[01:51:23.991 --> 01:51:25.591]  You see, he wasn't getting it from God.
[01:51:25.631 --> 01:51:27.752]  He was getting it and then using it for evil.
[01:51:28.232 --> 01:51:31.873]  Mike Adams, healthranger.com, naturalnews.com.
[01:51:32.373 --> 01:51:33.273]  How do people follow you?
[01:51:33.333 --> 01:51:34.613]  How do people support the great work you're doing?
[01:51:36.434 --> 01:51:38.794]  Just naturalnews.com, brighttown.com.
[01:51:38.834 --> 01:51:40.214]  And thank you, Alex, for having me on.
[01:51:40.254 --> 01:51:41.555]  God bless you and all your crew.
[01:51:41.995 --> 01:51:43.495]  And we'll stay tuned and spread the word.
[01:51:44.095 --> 01:51:44.435]  Thank you.
[01:51:44.755 --> 01:51:48.556]  So folks, if you want to know why the cult's scared, only the top initiates
[01:51:49.881 --> 01:51:51.022]  Know this, okay?
[01:51:51.482 --> 01:51:57.605]  So we're telling you the secret highest level initiation operation that they have, okay?
[01:51:58.246 --> 01:52:05.450]  And I've done it from literature and studying and their predictive programming, but that's like 30% of it.
[01:52:06.290 --> 01:52:08.752]  I literally get this information from God.
[01:52:09.639 --> 01:52:11.962]  It literally tells me their operations.
[01:52:12.002 --> 01:52:12.803]  That's what this is.
[01:52:13.223 --> 01:52:14.244]  And I'm not saying to impress people.
[01:52:14.264 --> 01:52:15.566]  That's why the enemy's so scared, folks.
[01:52:16.086 --> 01:52:22.354]  I'm nobody, but God chose me to do this, and I'm literally interfacing, and now I've just learned, whatever God says.
[01:52:22.374 --> 01:52:24.396]  Like, God says, they're shutting your company down tonight, get ready.
[01:52:24.636 --> 01:52:25.537]  Everybody's, how do you know this?
[01:52:25.637 --> 01:52:26.638]  It was real!
[01:52:27.594 --> 01:52:31.055]  And sure, I picked up stuff with the security guards, and I just bluffed, hey, why are more guys coming tonight?
[01:52:31.275 --> 01:52:31.936]  Well, how do you know that?
[01:52:32.276 --> 01:52:33.516]  I mean, that's God, folks.
[01:52:33.556 --> 01:52:35.437]  That wasn't me picking something up.
[01:52:35.837 --> 01:52:36.998]  That was God going, you notice that?
[01:52:37.018 --> 01:52:37.898]  It wasn't me.
[01:52:37.958 --> 01:52:39.459]  It was like, tap on the shoulder.
[01:52:39.479 --> 01:52:42.680]  Hey, you see that right there?
[01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:44.060]  This is powerful.
[01:52:44.221 --> 01:52:45.101]  God's real.
[01:52:45.181 --> 01:52:46.041]  We are eternal.
[01:52:46.882 --> 01:52:47.742]  Yeah, there's no doubt about it.
[01:52:47.762 --> 01:52:49.363]  I mean, that is amazing, people.
[01:52:49.423 --> 01:52:50.123]  It's real!
[01:52:52.509 --> 01:52:54.030]  We don't have to be scared of these people.
[01:52:54.110 --> 01:52:55.311]  Sure, we'll have some pain.
[01:52:56.012 --> 01:52:57.873]  But man, God's so much more powerful.
[01:52:57.933 --> 01:52:59.494]  It's like, you just gotta go with God.
[01:53:00.975 --> 01:53:02.176]  Jack said he had an emergency.
[01:53:02.216 --> 01:53:03.377]  He's had some trouble getting on.
[01:53:03.397 --> 01:53:07.761]  Get Roseanne Barr on.
[01:53:07.781 --> 01:53:08.281]  She's calling me.
[01:53:08.941 --> 01:53:09.862]  Jack said, give me five.
[01:53:09.902 --> 01:53:10.603]  Put her on speaker.
[01:53:10.963 --> 01:53:11.603]  No, I'll call her.
[01:53:11.944 --> 01:53:13.165]  There's Jack Posobiec.
[01:53:13.225 --> 01:53:13.905]  Well, let's go to him.
[01:53:13.985 --> 01:53:14.446]  Punch him up.
[01:53:14.766 --> 01:53:15.606]  He's a busy guy.
[01:53:16.227 --> 01:53:17.288]  He came on short notice.
[01:53:18.390 --> 01:53:19.351]  We got Steve Quayle.
[01:53:19.411 --> 01:53:21.854]  I got a Steve Bannon clip when he talked about this yesterday.
[01:53:21.894 --> 01:53:22.715]  I got that coming up.
[01:53:22.735 --> 01:53:25.018]  So I'll have to hold a little bit, push Quayle back a few minutes.
[01:53:25.038 --> 01:53:25.719]  He'll be okay.
[01:53:26.119 --> 01:53:32.327]  But I really respect Jack Posobiec of enable intelligence and great work with Trump and geopolitics.
[01:53:32.347 --> 01:53:33.268]  He's got some of the best advice.
[01:53:33.308 --> 01:53:34.970]  So I've been texting him all day and he's been busy.
[01:53:35.410 --> 01:53:41.839]  And I said, please come on, because I need your personal advice, what we should do and what's happening with Infowars and what's going on.
[01:53:41.879 --> 01:53:42.781]  So he joins us now.
[01:53:43.181 --> 01:53:46.646]  Jack, historic moment, massive stuff going down and happening.
[01:53:46.666 --> 01:53:51.072]  I don't know how much people will follow what's happening, but they tried to close the doors Friday and yesterday.
[01:53:51.653 --> 01:53:57.197]  I explained to a security private company that I hired years ago that was now under the control of the CRO, but not control of the company.
[01:53:57.217 --> 01:54:00.800]  I make the final decisions in the law to shut this down.
[01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:02.301]  I had to literally say I'm going to call the police.
[01:54:02.321 --> 01:54:03.162]  I had to block them.
[01:54:03.642 --> 01:54:04.383]  I had to say no.
[01:54:04.964 --> 01:54:06.445]  The security guys were like, yeah, we believe you.
[01:54:06.465 --> 01:54:07.385]  I said, where's the warrant?
[01:54:07.886 --> 01:54:08.546]  Where's the order?
[01:54:08.947 --> 01:54:13.750]  But something happened in the last 48 hours that panicked them to try to shut this place down.
[01:54:13.911 --> 01:54:16.513]  Look, I've been thinking about this all day.
[01:54:17.366 --> 01:54:19.208]  They may be even getting ready to assassinate Trump, folks.
[01:54:20.330 --> 01:54:20.730]  I don't know.
[01:54:21.131 --> 01:54:22.112]  Something big's coming.
[01:54:22.152 --> 01:54:25.276]  Jack, you're one of the smartest people I know, and I don't just say that to people's ass.
[01:54:25.677 --> 01:54:29.622]  I want you to listen to Jack Posobiec, because I want to learn what he thinks.
[01:54:30.042 --> 01:54:31.244]  I've told you what I'm thinking.
[01:54:31.584 --> 01:54:32.826]  Something big's about to happen.
[01:54:32.866 --> 01:54:33.987]  They are totally desperate.
[01:54:34.368 --> 01:54:35.229]  Jack, what do you think's going on?
[01:54:37.046 --> 01:54:59.809]  Alex, remember, we are 156 days away from the decision of whether or not this country will continue on in its current form as a republic or whether we will become the full-flung tyranny that you, Alex Jones, have been doing on this program and various iterations of this program
[01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:02.590]  For three decades now.
[01:55:02.990 --> 01:55:07.130]  You have been the canary in the coal mine for every step of the way.
[01:55:07.390 --> 01:55:18.073]  You were the canary in the coal mine for censorship, the mass censorship, the way that you were digitally executed in the public square of the 21st century in 2018-2019.
[01:55:18.313 --> 01:55:20.193]  Then what came next?
[01:55:20.213 --> 01:55:22.373]  The lawfare wasn't used against Trump first.
[01:55:22.473 --> 01:55:25.534]  No, it was used against Alex Jones first.
[01:55:25.774 --> 01:55:30.639]  So they gave you a social assassination along with your digital assassination.
[01:55:30.919 --> 01:55:32.341]  What are they trying to do now to Trump?
[01:55:32.661 --> 01:55:35.244]  They are trying to socially assassinate him.
[01:55:35.624 --> 01:55:39.768]  Next, of course, comes the deplatforming, the great shutting down.
[01:55:39.808 --> 01:55:41.310]  Because Alex, here's the thing.
[01:55:41.890 --> 01:56:02.357]  After your three decades on this post, manning your watch, telling us what's coming, telling us what's coming next, telling us every single step the globalists are going to make before they make it, sometimes years in advance, we've all seen the jar that Alex Jones was right jar, and everyone's got him filled all over the place.
[01:56:03.138 --> 01:56:15.950]  And by the way, everyone should use those Alex Jones is right jars to go fill in the coffers of InfoWars and go fill in the financial support and the legal support of Alex Jones to be able to keep this broadcast going.
[01:56:16.210 --> 01:56:27.301]  So Alex, I'll tell you what, the reason they're trying to shut you down is because you and we and freedom and God are winning and they are terrified.
[01:56:27.621 --> 01:56:28.402]  They're hammers.
[01:56:28.422 --> 01:56:35.789]  The only thing they know how to do is beat down dissent, and you're the biggest dissident in the entire Western Hemisphere.
[01:56:36.149 --> 01:56:37.991]  That's why they're trying to take you out first.
[01:56:38.051 --> 01:56:52.164]  And so what everybody needs to do, and I'll tell you right now, I'm here to say I stand for the freedom of speech of Alex Jones and the platform he represents, because if you don't stand for that, then you don't stand for the ideals of this country.
[01:56:53.064 --> 01:56:53.725]  Stay with us.
[01:56:53.905 --> 01:56:54.485]  We got you on late.
[01:56:54.505 --> 01:56:55.306]  We get you're busy.
[01:56:56.207 --> 01:56:57.928]  I'm glad you came back to the studio to come on with us.
[01:56:57.948 --> 01:56:58.589]  We've got to go to break.
[01:56:58.889 --> 01:57:02.792]  We'll come right back to you for another 15 minutes and then we've got Steve Quill and a bunch of other guests.
[01:57:02.812 --> 01:57:05.094]  I've got a Steve Bannon clip from last night I want to play to support the show.
[01:57:05.114 --> 01:57:07.736]  But yeah, I don't see this as me being attacked.
[01:57:08.877 --> 01:57:12.740]  It literally shows their desperation and they're attacking at every level.
[01:57:13.081 --> 01:57:14.282]  Jack, how do people follow you on X?
[01:57:16.434 --> 01:57:19.097]  Of course, if people know, I'm at Jack Posobiec on Next.
[01:57:19.117 --> 01:57:21.159]  We've got the book up on humansbook.com.
[01:57:21.419 --> 01:57:22.119]  We'll be down there.
[01:57:22.420 --> 01:57:29.286]  Alex, we were planning, you and I have been talking about coming down to Austin, and we were going to do a whole thing, so we're going to have to figure out exactly what we're going to do.
[01:57:29.586 --> 01:57:32.989]  Look, if we've got to live stream it on all my platforms, that's exactly what we're going to do.
[01:57:33.049 --> 01:57:33.190]  Exactly.
[01:57:33.210 --> 01:57:34.451]  I'm going to go ahead and announce this.
[01:57:34.651 --> 01:57:35.352]  We already had it set.
[01:57:35.372 --> 01:57:37.494]  Tucker Carlson's coming in the next few days.
[01:57:37.974 --> 01:57:38.695]  Jack, get down here.
[01:57:38.715 --> 01:57:40.156]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds.
[01:57:40.176 --> 01:57:40.576]  Stay with us.
[01:57:40.737 --> 01:57:41.077]  Stay with us.
[01:57:44.412 --> 01:57:46.220]  Thank you for joining us here today.
[01:57:48.550 --> 01:57:55.113]  Earlier this afternoon, Donald Trump was arraigned by a Manhattan grand jury on 34 felony counts.
[01:57:55.853 --> 01:57:57.334]  This case is an abomination.
[01:57:57.394 --> 01:57:58.914]  You know, it's obviously political.
[01:57:59.014 --> 01:58:00.995]  Seven years to try to come up with this case.
[01:58:01.455 --> 01:58:02.796]  They're just wrong on the law.
[01:58:03.176 --> 01:58:07.538]  The only crime that Donald Trump is being prosecuted for is the crime of running for president.
[01:58:07.758 --> 01:58:10.159]  Political persecution at the highest level.
[01:58:10.459 --> 01:58:13.080]  They've quite frankly given up on trying to beat him at the polls.
[01:58:13.300 --> 01:58:15.201]  Either going to steal it or stop it by law firm.
[01:58:15.441 --> 01:58:19.624]  Democrat prosecutor elected on a get Trump platform.
[01:58:19.704 --> 01:58:23.026]  What's going on here is a disgusting disgrace.
[01:58:23.606 --> 01:58:24.727]  It is war on Trump.
[01:58:25.327 --> 01:58:27.229]  It is war on the Republican Party.
[01:58:27.609 --> 01:58:29.170]  And it is a war on the Republic.
[01:58:29.950 --> 01:58:35.574]  This case is the weakest case I've seen in 60 years of teaching, practicing, and writing about criminal law.
[01:58:35.794 --> 01:58:41.217]  I doubt the New York indictment would have been brought against a defendant whose name was not Donald Trump.
[01:58:41.377 --> 01:58:45.540]  This judge, I mean, you don't need a prosecutor if you have a judge like this.
[01:58:45.860 --> 01:58:47.261]  This judge is not on the level.
[01:58:47.281 --> 01:58:53.525]  It's a terrible case, but the judge has been pretty much a rubber stamp on everything that Bregg has wanted to do.
[01:58:53.805 --> 01:58:56.007]  They're perverting the system of justice.
[01:58:56.387 --> 01:58:58.168]  You know, that's where the danger lies.
[01:58:58.368 --> 01:59:01.270]  The corruption and subversion of our institutions by the left.
[01:59:02.452 --> 01:59:12.440]  This is the Democrats' entire strategy to confine President Trump to a dirty criminal courtroom and keep him off the campaign trail where he can bring his winning message to voters across this country.
[01:59:12.561 --> 01:59:14.602]  New York has become a legal banana republic.
[01:59:14.842 --> 01:59:17.265]  They are so determined to get Donald Trump.
[01:59:17.585 --> 01:59:20.507]  Look, convicting Donald Trump, that's all they have.
[01:59:20.908 --> 01:59:23.049]  I think they have no cards.
[01:59:23.490 --> 01:59:25.752]  And they're depending upon Trump getting convicted.
[01:59:25.912 --> 01:59:28.854]  That Trump train doesn't show any signs of slowing down.
[01:59:29.235 --> 01:59:30.476]  The only verdict that matters
[01:59:32.022 --> 01:59:40.388]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:00:22.949 --> 02:00:25.252]  Jack Posobiec, we're gonna have you 15 more minutes.
[02:00:25.472 --> 02:00:26.553]  We really appreciate your time.
[02:00:26.913 --> 02:00:29.035]  Continue on where we are as a republic.
[02:00:31.818 --> 02:00:35.662]  I mean, Alex, it's... Anyone who's been paying attention...
[02:00:36.331 --> 02:00:51.584]  For the last five years, the last 50 years, the last 15 years, or even just the last five minutes, everything that we've known since Trump's verdict, since this false verdict of the show trial of a former President of the United States has come in, it's very clear.
[02:00:52.445 --> 02:00:53.926]  Alex, the Republic is dead.
[02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:57.762]  The Constitution died a long time ago.
[02:00:57.982 --> 02:01:01.504]  We can argue about and debate about when exactly that happened.
[02:01:02.224 --> 02:01:07.628]  The chipping away of freedom and liberty, all beginning with the Fed.
[02:01:07.728 --> 02:01:09.669]  Some people take it back even further than that.
[02:01:09.709 --> 02:01:13.511]  Then we get the New Deal, the 1960s, all of the things that have happened.
[02:01:13.551 --> 02:01:16.593]  Okay, the rise of the police state, which you documented in real time.
[02:01:16.633 --> 02:01:20.135]  We can argue about when exactly the Constitution died.
[02:01:20.375 --> 02:01:24.338]  But people need to understand we do not currently live in that system.
[02:01:24.898 --> 02:01:28.439]  We live in a system that is currently controlled... and look, I got a lot of pushback.
[02:01:28.459 --> 02:01:29.899]  I gotta interrupt you, that is so key.
[02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:33.601]  It's not a negative black pill, it's admitting we're under a coup.
[02:01:33.941 --> 02:01:36.141]  We have to admit how bad it is to fix it.
[02:01:36.321 --> 02:01:43.483]  We have to fully... I get from the public, just with the shutdown of InfoWars that's happening, that people finally get, oh, we really are fucked.
[02:01:47.064 --> 02:01:48.825]  Alex, here's the thing.
[02:01:49.699 --> 02:01:52.280]  I actually, I would say that I disagree, and here's why.
[02:01:52.801 --> 02:01:55.182]  Because I've seen the reaction to the Trump verdict.
[02:01:55.242 --> 02:01:56.642]  Look at that UFC crowd.
[02:01:56.662 --> 02:01:57.903]  No, I'm not saying we're losing.
[02:01:57.983 --> 02:01:59.724]  I'm saying if we don't wake up, we're screwed.
[02:02:00.864 --> 02:02:01.825]  If we don't wake up, we're screwed.
[02:02:02.045 --> 02:02:03.245]  But this is what I'm saying, though.
[02:02:03.726 --> 02:02:07.788]  This verdict, shutting you down, pulling your microphone away.
[02:02:08.168 --> 02:02:12.650]  This is waking up people to the tactics, people that weren't even, look, I've been to that
[02:02:13.439 --> 02:02:14.860]  You know, you said, what was I doing this weekend?
[02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:17.761]  Look, we've been doing barbecues and kids' birthday parties.
[02:02:18.021 --> 02:02:20.722]  I've been out in Normie World, Little League baseball games.
[02:02:20.762 --> 02:02:21.702]  I've been out in Normie World.
[02:02:21.722 --> 02:02:22.502]  Let me tell you something.
[02:02:22.842 --> 02:02:27.664]  The people in Normie World, because they know who I am, they know what I do, and they come up to me and say, are we going to be okay?
[02:02:27.704 --> 02:02:28.784]  Are we going to get through this?
[02:02:29.264 --> 02:02:31.145]  They're not actually going to try to put Trump in jail.
[02:02:31.185 --> 02:02:33.146]  And I say, I think they are going to try to put Trump in jail.
[02:02:33.466 --> 02:02:36.267]  But these are people who don't follow politics regularly.
[02:02:36.647 --> 02:02:41.611]  But this story specifically, Alex, that's why they tried to paint you the way they do.
[02:02:41.931 --> 02:02:47.015]  That's why they tried to smear you and smear me and conduct social assassination on all of us the way they do.
[02:02:47.315 --> 02:02:56.642]  But when they went after Trump, they found a target that was too big because he had been in the public eye for too long, because he had been a household name for too long.
[02:02:56.883 --> 02:03:01.506]  He had been someone, he's in every movie, he's in all the TV shows, on Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and everything.
[02:03:01.886 --> 02:03:03.448]  You know, he's got the number one show on NBC.
[02:03:04.324 --> 02:03:07.709]  They couldn't do it to him because people know who he is.
[02:03:08.149 --> 02:03:13.176]  And this specifically has been them going too far.
[02:03:13.677 --> 02:03:16.480]  And this has woken up so many people that never woke up before.
[02:03:16.821 --> 02:03:18.944]  That's why you see the UFC crowd the way it is.
[02:03:19.364 --> 02:03:25.806]  That's why you see people donating $200 million to the Trump campaign in what, 48 hours?
[02:03:26.086 --> 02:03:31.848]  And I'm telling you, Alex, the reason they're going after you now is because they know everyone's focused on the Trump thing.
[02:03:32.109 --> 02:03:34.930]  They know everyone's looking at this, but here's what they've miscalculated.
[02:03:34.950 --> 02:03:40.271]  They've gravely miscalculated, and the globalists have made a strategic error.
[02:03:40.572 --> 02:03:47.354]  They've made a strategic error in thinking that they could take you out now because people are more focused on Trump, but here's the strategic error.
[02:03:48.357 --> 02:03:50.418]  People are activated now.
[02:03:50.779 --> 02:03:52.080]  People are galvanized.
[02:03:52.140 --> 02:03:58.224]  People are motivated and people are sick of the crap and nobody's putting up with it anymore.
[02:03:58.384 --> 02:04:00.285]  They say, you want to put my kids in camps?
[02:04:00.565 --> 02:04:02.307]  You want to re-educate my children?
[02:04:02.327 --> 02:04:05.569]  You want to be like Miss Rachel and turn my kids gay and all this stuff?
[02:04:05.609 --> 02:04:05.929]  You know what?
[02:04:06.029 --> 02:04:06.609]  We're done with it.
[02:04:06.850 --> 02:04:07.770]  We're done with all of it.
[02:04:07.970 --> 02:04:09.071]  We don't care what you call us.
[02:04:09.111 --> 02:04:11.193]  We don't care what you say about us.
[02:04:11.433 --> 02:04:13.134]  We are going to fight back and we're
[02:04:16.493 --> 02:04:17.994]  All right, Jack Kosobik just cut out.
[02:04:18.034 --> 02:04:18.555]  Jack, you're back.
[02:04:18.575 --> 02:04:18.895]  Keep going.
[02:04:18.935 --> 02:04:20.537]  They're going to... Keep going, Jack.
[02:04:23.119 --> 02:04:24.200]  You only cut out for a second.
[02:04:24.220 --> 02:04:24.620]  Jack, you're back.
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:24.981]  Well, yeah, yeah.
[02:04:25.001 --> 02:04:28.384]  Of course, they're trying to... They're trying to take you out.
[02:04:28.424 --> 02:04:30.486]  They're trying to take down your signal.
[02:04:30.506 --> 02:04:32.207]  They're probably up there on the roof right now.
[02:04:32.547 --> 02:04:35.550]  Look, too many people have woken up at this point.
[02:04:35.610 --> 02:04:36.711]  Too many people have woken up.
[02:04:36.751 --> 02:04:38.373]  By the way, I hadn't raised that point.
[02:04:38.453 --> 02:04:40.655]  I didn't want to tell you, but... Small dollar.
[02:04:41.095 --> 02:04:41.796]  Small dollar.
[02:04:42.657 --> 02:04:49.159]  I didn't mean to interrupt you, five more minutes and I'm going to go, but that would take hours to explain all the weirdness going on around here.
[02:04:49.579 --> 02:04:56.802]  Like, they hacked into my phone today and took control of it during multiple phone calls where the computer screen came on and showed my phone was taken over.
[02:04:56.822 --> 02:04:57.442]  They wanted me to know.
[02:04:57.802 --> 02:04:59.503]  They're driving around the building right now.
[02:04:59.563 --> 02:05:00.763]  They're really... Happened to be in my house.
[02:05:01.023 --> 02:05:04.845]  I took my computer home to my house and the mouse went haywire and the keyboard went haywire today.
[02:05:04.885 --> 02:05:07.466]  That's weird that we had a similar... Well, they start going and downloading all your stuff.
[02:05:07.486 --> 02:05:07.666]  Yeah.
[02:05:07.986 --> 02:05:10.367]  I mean, Jack, you know, explain to people what's going on.
[02:05:11.687 --> 02:05:17.768]  We've read the book, and when people got so mad at us when we announced the book title was called Unhumans.
[02:05:17.929 --> 02:05:19.269]  And they said, how dare you say that?
[02:05:19.609 --> 02:05:20.329]  How dare you?
[02:05:20.609 --> 02:05:21.769]  Don't be mean.
[02:05:22.550 --> 02:05:24.110]  What if they do that to us?
[02:05:24.170 --> 02:05:25.630]  What if they call us mean words?
[02:05:25.950 --> 02:05:27.131]  What if they... Look, you know what?
[02:05:27.751 --> 02:05:29.171]  I'm sick of turning the other cheek.
[02:05:29.511 --> 02:05:30.852]  I'm sick of turning the other cheek.
[02:05:30.872 --> 02:05:32.832]  Jesus didn't tell us to turn the other cheek every time.
[02:05:33.012 --> 02:05:34.552]  No, he said you must fight evil.
[02:05:34.993 --> 02:05:36.873]  You cannot let evil stand.
[02:05:37.333 --> 02:05:39.835]  And these people are on humans.
[02:05:40.175 --> 02:05:41.596]  They are on humans.
[02:05:41.877 --> 02:05:58.009]  That is why the things that they do, the things that they're willing to do to children, to little children, the things they're willing to do overseas in the name of war, in the name of freedom, the destruction, the evil, the slaughter, that the rivers of blood that they thirst on.
[02:05:58.269 --> 02:05:59.410]  I'm telling you something right now.
[02:05:59.990 --> 02:06:01.971]  There's a reason for all of this.
[02:06:02.231 --> 02:06:03.031]  They're un-humans.
[02:06:03.351 --> 02:06:05.052]  Don't listen to the things that they say.
[02:06:05.412 --> 02:06:06.412]  Look at what they do.
[02:06:06.752 --> 02:06:07.813]  I always say this again and again.
[02:06:07.833 --> 02:06:14.855]  And your book has a double entendre, because you also explain, they un-human us before they kill us, but they're actually the un-humans.
[02:06:15.215 --> 02:06:16.476]  Correct.
[02:06:16.736 --> 02:06:19.697]  So, what they must do, what they are, what they're
[02:06:21.127 --> 02:06:41.128]  The goal of their program is to bring us down, people who have been, and not just people like you and me, I'm talking about people who are successful, people who are attractive, people who have good businesses, people who have success in media, in sports, in art, in real science, all of these things must be destroyed.
[02:06:41.488 --> 02:06:44.249]  Societies that are successful must be destroyed.
[02:06:44.329 --> 02:06:44.610]  Why?
[02:06:44.850 --> 02:06:53.174]  Because deep down they are envious, they are petty, they are tyrants, and they hate the fact that they cannot be better.
[02:06:53.254 --> 02:07:00.297]  And so rather than try to better themselves, they decide to try to un-human those that they have perceived as the enemy.
[02:07:00.497 --> 02:07:03.679]  And that is why you will see them go... Who did the Bolsheviks go after?
[02:07:04.019 --> 02:07:05.000]  Right.
[02:07:05.360 --> 02:07:08.002]  They went after the rich, but then they went after the kulaks.
[02:07:08.302 --> 02:07:09.983]  That's the small business owner.
[02:07:10.043 --> 02:07:16.767]  That's someone who's got a little bit of land, or these days, someone who might have, you know, an extra house, or someone who's basically middle class.
[02:07:17.167 --> 02:07:20.530]  Who's got a house they put up on Airbnb, or a second house they rent, or something like that.
[02:07:20.830 --> 02:07:24.032]  Those are the people that they were dragging out into the streets and shooting.
[02:07:24.212 --> 02:07:25.092]  They did this in Russia.
[02:07:25.293 --> 02:07:25.753]  They did this in
[02:07:25.933 --> 02:07:26.794]  We're good to go.
[02:07:42.817 --> 02:07:47.799]  The jig is up because people like, it's not just Alex Jones anymore.
[02:07:47.999 --> 02:07:50.380]  You've got Steve Bannon out there selling the truth.
[02:07:50.600 --> 02:07:53.081]  You've got Donald Trump now who's leading in all the polls.
[02:07:53.121 --> 02:08:00.565]  By the way, even after the conviction is still leading in the polls, you've got massive organizations like Charlie Kirk and he's holding an event with Trump in Detroit.
[02:08:00.605 --> 02:08:01.185]  We're going to be there.
[02:08:02.080 --> 02:08:07.065]  Next Saturday, there's so many people now that are totally clued into this agenda, to the globalists.
[02:08:07.326 --> 02:08:10.849]  Klaus Schwab, of course, just had to step down, that they are freaking out.
[02:08:10.889 --> 02:08:11.870]  But I'll tell you this, Alex.
[02:08:12.171 --> 02:08:13.132]  We're in the endgame.
[02:08:13.352 --> 02:08:15.214]  We're in the endgame right now.
[02:08:15.474 --> 02:08:19.018]  And the next, what, four to five months are going to determine the future of everything.
[02:08:21.209 --> 02:08:24.071]  Alright, Jack Posobiec, incredible job, amazing.
[02:08:24.131 --> 02:08:26.372]  What else can we do to support Trump in this epic time?
[02:08:26.392 --> 02:08:31.074]  I'm so concerned, in closing, with 155 days left to the election of false flags.
[02:08:31.114 --> 02:08:31.855]  And I said they would do it.
[02:08:31.875 --> 02:08:32.695]  Now they're pre-programming.
[02:08:32.995 --> 02:08:34.236]  Trump supporters are going to get violent.
[02:08:34.256 --> 02:08:35.077]  They're going to blow stuff up.
[02:08:35.097 --> 02:08:37.098]  They're going to kill people because of Trump conviction.
[02:08:37.118 --> 02:08:38.298]  Trump's like, no, no, be peaceful.
[02:08:38.338 --> 02:08:39.379]  I'll go to jail, blah, blah, blah.
[02:08:39.639 --> 02:08:40.580]  He's being very Christ-like.
[02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:42.160]  They're trying to say, we're going to be violent.
[02:08:42.200 --> 02:08:44.041]  They're trying to say, we're going to be violent.
[02:08:44.061 --> 02:08:44.822]  Nobody should be violent.
[02:08:44.842 --> 02:08:46.743]  They don't want someone speaking the truth during the election.
[02:08:47.063 --> 02:08:50.564]  They want you gone because they don't want someone out there speaking the truth during the election.
[02:08:50.584 --> 02:08:56.606]  They think they can headshot you, pull the plug on this microphone, and they want to be able to go into the election without having Infowars.
[02:08:56.626 --> 02:08:58.827]  They don't want you there in Milwaukee at the RNC.
[02:08:58.847 --> 02:09:00.748]  They don't want you there in Chicago at the DNC.
[02:09:00.768 --> 02:09:02.288]  We're going to be at all of them, by the way.
[02:09:02.608 --> 02:09:06.750]  And there's going to be so many of us out there that they won't be able to stop it.
[02:09:07.090 --> 02:09:08.351]  Because they don't want to tell the truth.
[02:09:08.392 --> 02:09:10.154]  They don't want to tell the truth that Alex Jones was there.
[02:09:10.174 --> 02:09:14.058]  And I post a video every time on January 6th telling people to not go into the U.S.
[02:09:14.098 --> 02:09:14.519]  Capitol.
[02:09:14.779 --> 02:09:15.680]  Don't do what they want.
[02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:22.908]  And let me tell you real quick, the CRO, that is clearly this operative in my opinion and view, and has been exposed and tried to shut us down Friday and yesterday.
[02:09:22.928 --> 02:09:24.871]  I just said, fine, I'm calling the police.
[02:09:24.911 --> 02:09:25.792]  Let's have a big scene here.
[02:09:25.832 --> 02:09:26.493]  I'm going to expose you.
[02:09:26.533 --> 02:09:27.153]  You don't have an order.
[02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:32.503]  He said, I said six months ago, I said, we've got to get the RNC hotels and stuff.
[02:09:32.523 --> 02:09:33.244]  They're cheap right now.
[02:09:33.264 --> 02:09:36.246]  If you don't book them now, it's going to be extremely expensive.
[02:09:36.266 --> 02:09:42.671]  They have plenty of money, not a huge extra arsenal, but they've got millions of extra dollars and in full wars in this bankruptcy.
[02:09:43.051 --> 02:09:45.513]  He's like, oh yeah, we're going to see the RNC and DNC.
[02:09:45.833 --> 02:09:47.694]  And then a month ago he goes, no more trips.
[02:09:48.195 --> 02:09:49.936]  You're not going to the border, which costs like $10,000.
[02:09:51.417 --> 02:09:52.218]  Well, I'm actually encouraged.
[02:10:07.089 --> 02:10:13.636]  I'm encouraged about it because there's that old expression, first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.
[02:10:13.776 --> 02:10:23.525]  And I think that once they get to the point where they're fighting you this hard, the momentum on your side going for you, whether it's Trump or whether it's you, Alex, is so great that no matter what they do, there's no... No, I agree.
[02:10:23.545 --> 02:10:25.587]  And that's the last question we've got to go see Quill.
[02:10:27.229 --> 02:10:29.831]  Talking to Jack Posobiec, such a great mind on this.
[02:10:30.885 --> 02:10:34.387]  This is a microcosm of America and Trump and the attack on all of us.
[02:10:34.928 --> 02:10:37.049]  But yeah, I agree with you.
[02:10:37.089 --> 02:10:39.651]  We really are winning huge.
[02:10:40.151 --> 02:10:41.312]  And that's why they're so panicked.
[02:10:41.332 --> 02:10:44.134]  But then I've got to get concerned about they'll try to start a nuclear war.
[02:10:45.194 --> 02:10:48.497]  They'll try to pull all of this crazy stuff they're doing.
[02:10:48.557 --> 02:10:49.717]  So how do we thread that needle?
[02:10:49.777 --> 02:10:52.019]  What can we do to derail that?
[02:10:54.773 --> 02:10:56.234]  Alex, it's very simple.
[02:10:56.334 --> 02:10:59.615]  People have already started to get out in the streets for Trump.
[02:10:59.635 --> 02:11:01.515]  We've seen these flash mobs that are going around.
[02:11:01.875 --> 02:11:04.016]  People also need to get vocal about this.
[02:11:04.376 --> 02:11:05.236]  Share this stream.
[02:11:05.577 --> 02:11:08.497]  Share it with people who agree with you, people who don't disagree.
[02:11:08.537 --> 02:11:16.060]  By the way, another thing that I've been saying, and this is big, and I've said this to the RNC, and I've said this to the campaign, and anyone who will listen on my program,
[02:11:17.106 --> 02:11:19.247]  MAGA Community Centers.
[02:11:19.648 --> 02:11:21.249]  I know it sounds wild, but hear me out.
[02:11:21.649 --> 02:11:23.030]  MAGA Community Centers.
[02:11:23.270 --> 02:11:28.293]  Where you can have a barbecue with people in your area and you try to reach... No, it's all about community.
[02:11:28.333 --> 02:11:29.313]  It's all about coming together.
[02:11:29.673 --> 02:11:30.574]  Your Skype broke up.
[02:11:30.914 --> 02:11:31.955]  MAGA Community Centers.
[02:11:33.237 --> 02:11:34.038]  Bring those people in.
[02:11:34.178 --> 02:11:35.219]  Do it for the 4th of July.
[02:11:35.299 --> 02:11:35.900]  Have free stuff.
[02:11:35.940 --> 02:11:36.580]  Have everything else.
[02:11:36.961 --> 02:11:39.303]  Bring people together in the real space.
[02:11:39.843 --> 02:11:41.085]  Throw on a clip of Alex Jones.
[02:11:41.125 --> 02:11:43.047]  Throw on one of the songs or something that people like.
[02:11:43.507 --> 02:11:51.575]  Or throw on one of the clips that talk about the fact that Alex Jones for 30 years has been the largest anti-war program and outfit
[02:11:51.975 --> 02:11:52.996]  In the world.
[02:11:53.276 --> 02:11:54.556]  In the absolute world.
[02:11:54.777 --> 02:11:56.497]  This is a guy who stands for peace.
[02:11:56.778 --> 02:11:58.859]  This is a guy who stands for people getting along.
[02:11:59.079 --> 02:12:01.400]  This is a guy who stands for humanity.
[02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:03.361]  Who stands against tyranny.
[02:12:03.581 --> 02:12:05.682]  And they will never ever say that.
[02:12:05.742 --> 02:12:12.406]  And so once you start showing these people the truth, and showing people what's going on out there, that's how you build the army in real society.
[02:12:12.446 --> 02:12:13.966]  Why did you say I think that's crazy?
[02:12:14.066 --> 02:12:14.927]  That is the answer.
[02:12:15.347 --> 02:12:15.487]  Exactly.
[02:12:15.507 --> 02:12:15.828]  Exactly.
[02:12:33.823 --> 02:12:34.964]  No, I love it.
[02:12:35.004 --> 02:12:38.126]  Call it a Freedom Block Party, call it an America Block Party, whatever you want to call it.
[02:12:38.186 --> 02:12:39.206]  Whatever you want to call it.
[02:12:39.226 --> 02:12:40.527]  It doesn't have to be a Trump thing.
[02:12:40.807 --> 02:12:54.516]  Just make it something where you bring together like-minded people and then you try to bring maybe five to ten people that you know aren't registered to vote or you know they don't know the process or if they did get registered then they don't know exactly how to vote in early voting.
[02:12:54.696 --> 02:12:56.858]  If you live in one of the swing states, you better be doing this.
[02:12:56.878 --> 02:13:01.583]  If you live in Pennsylvania, if you live in Michigan, if you live in North Carolina, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia, etc.
[02:13:01.864 --> 02:13:03.245]  These are the places that you need this.
[02:13:03.425 --> 02:13:12.435]  We're talking block parties, barbecues, if you're going fishing, if you live on the Great Lakes, whatever it is, whatever the thing is in your area, you need to be the one hosting it.
[02:13:12.735 --> 02:13:17.340]  Now you got people in real space, and by the way, as Alex just said,
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:22.625]  If the crab hits the fan, now you've got a network of people who you know.
[02:13:22.645 --> 02:13:23.766]  It's like when you're getting on the plane.
[02:13:23.786 --> 02:13:27.629]  It's like when you're getting on the plane, you kind of size up the passengers around you.
[02:13:27.649 --> 02:13:33.355]  You know, alright, if something goes down, that guy's gonna be helpful, this guy's gonna be helpful, this guy's gonna be a problem, this guy's gonna be a problem.
[02:13:33.715 --> 02:13:37.878]  But you kind of figure out, all the men sort of figure out who's going to be involved.
[02:13:37.898 --> 02:13:39.499]  And everybody was doing this after 9-11.
[02:13:39.779 --> 02:13:42.121]  You need to start doing that in the real world now.
[02:13:42.181 --> 02:13:43.482]  You need to get to know your neighbors.
[02:13:43.702 --> 02:13:45.723]  You get to know who's going to be your friend.
[02:13:45.763 --> 02:13:46.064]  That's right.
[02:13:46.104 --> 02:13:48.085]  We're having a crazy time in society.
[02:13:48.305 --> 02:13:49.506]  You don't have to agree on everything.
[02:13:49.766 --> 02:13:57.251]  But agree that you want to live together in peace and harmony in the United States of America that was given to us and bequeathed to us.
[02:13:57.332 --> 02:13:57.992]  Guess what, Alex?
[02:13:58.272 --> 02:13:59.213]  There's nobody else coming.
[02:13:59.453 --> 02:14:00.514]  There's nobody else coming.
[02:14:00.594 --> 02:14:01.975]  It's up to us right now.
[02:14:02.455 --> 02:14:03.175]  It's up to you.
[02:14:03.235 --> 02:14:04.115]  It is incumbent on us.
[02:14:04.135 --> 02:14:05.776]  I was going to post that on Dex today.
[02:14:05.816 --> 02:14:08.276]  I was going to just say, nobody's coming to save you, folks.
[02:14:08.336 --> 02:14:09.116]  Trump needs us.
[02:14:09.157 --> 02:14:11.217]  He's not some magic guy that can do it.
[02:14:11.237 --> 02:14:12.077]  He's great and amazing.
[02:14:12.117 --> 02:14:13.497]  We've got to get serious.
[02:14:13.838 --> 02:14:15.038]  Jack Mossovic, thank you so much.
[02:14:15.078 --> 02:14:18.218]  Hey, we could be shut down, probably not tomorrow, but very, very soon.
[02:14:18.939 --> 02:14:19.979]  You were saying you were coming to town.
[02:14:20.059 --> 02:14:21.799]  I'd love to get you onto a whole hour on your book.
[02:14:22.099 --> 02:14:23.100]  We love you, Jack Mossovic.
[02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:23.620]  Thank you so much.
[02:14:24.520 --> 02:14:25.520]  Let me, I'll just add on this.
[02:14:25.760 --> 02:14:29.481]  Alex Jones will never, ever be shut down.
[02:14:30.663 --> 02:14:31.004]  Thank you.
[02:14:31.464 --> 02:14:38.216]  Well, I do have that little bit of, uh, solace that they could kill me tomorrow or whatever.
[02:14:38.236 --> 02:14:39.898]  It just makes the clubs bigger.
[02:14:39.938 --> 02:14:40.760]  It makes everything bigger.
[02:14:42.372 --> 02:14:43.553]  Thank you for holding.
[02:14:44.233 --> 02:14:48.875]  We really appreciate having one of the elders with us and help me because he's old.
[02:14:48.895 --> 02:14:53.457]  I first knew this guy, started interviewing him 28 years ago.
[02:14:53.897 --> 02:14:56.278]  He'd been doing stuff big for six, seven years before that.
[02:14:56.798 --> 02:14:59.520]  And David Icke is a great guy and people give David Icke credit and they should.
[02:14:59.980 --> 02:15:06.623]  But if you actually read his books and what he was saying on my show and his show, my show 27, 28 years ago, his show 35 years ago, there is no one
[02:15:10.563 --> 02:15:12.024]  And I mean no one.
[02:15:12.044 --> 02:15:15.628]  And it's not about credit, it's about the knowledge you better look at.
[02:15:15.888 --> 02:15:21.633]  There is no one that knows as much as Steve Quayle.
[02:15:22.474 --> 02:15:35.386]  But his only issue, and it clicked like five years ago, he is so far ahead, he keeps saying it's imminent because it's so real because he's gotten the transmission from the Holy Spirit, but now everything he said is now here exactly.
[02:15:36.287 --> 02:15:41.791]  As he said, this last night as I slept here with him trying to shut us down, I went and got his books off the shelf that I'd already read.
[02:15:41.811 --> 02:15:42.992]  These huge books.
[02:15:43.032 --> 02:15:43.673]  I was reading.
[02:15:43.693 --> 02:15:45.434]  I was like, this book's 20 years old.
[02:15:45.474 --> 02:15:46.315]  This book's 10 years old.
[02:15:46.595 --> 02:15:49.237]  This is like, this is prophecy.
[02:15:49.958 --> 02:15:51.379]  And so people call me a prophet.
[02:15:51.439 --> 02:15:52.860]  Yeah, I get transmissions from God.
[02:15:53.260 --> 02:15:53.720]  It's true.
[02:15:54.161 --> 02:15:56.022]  But I was too dumb to follow them when I would get them.
[02:15:56.042 --> 02:15:57.203]  I was like, that's just my thoughts.
[02:15:57.563 --> 02:15:58.564]  Now I know they're real.
[02:15:58.624 --> 02:16:00.285]  I follow them now and I'm unstoppable.
[02:16:00.345 --> 02:16:05.649]  I literally know what's going to happen next because I've got to cleave to God.
[02:16:05.669 --> 02:16:11.473]  I've got to fully... I know God's real, but there's that arrogance at a subconscious level that I'm the man.
[02:16:11.674 --> 02:16:12.434]  I'm the badass.
[02:16:12.734 --> 02:16:13.895]  I will defeat the new world order.
[02:16:14.356 --> 02:16:15.176]  I will defeat Satan.
[02:16:15.336 --> 02:16:18.218]  I will do nothing without God telling me to do it.
[02:16:18.499 --> 02:16:20.080]  Christ Jesus is everything.
[02:16:20.939 --> 02:16:24.400]  And that's why they hate the name of Jesus Christ, because it's powerful, because it's real.
[02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:26.861]  It has the keys to the deed to this planet.
[02:16:27.221 --> 02:16:30.822]  And you will all be destroyed, and you will lose your souls unless you follow Christ.
[02:16:30.842 --> 02:16:33.262]  It doesn't mean some follow some captured church.
[02:16:33.663 --> 02:16:36.303]  The Catholic Church, the Protestant Church, they're almost all captured.
[02:16:36.483 --> 02:16:37.424]  They're candy asses.
[02:16:37.604 --> 02:16:38.704]  They don't want to scare anybody.
[02:16:38.884 --> 02:16:40.144]  They want to sit there and bow down.
[02:16:40.324 --> 02:16:44.025]  But God, Jesus said, His Son said, you interface with God.
[02:16:44.085 --> 02:16:47.526]  You pray at 3 a.m., knock the Pharisee up on the hill in front of everybody at noon.
[02:16:48.147 --> 02:16:49.007]  So, Steve Quayle.
[02:16:49.827 --> 02:16:57.093]  Joining us at this epic moment of time where we're using the giant audience tuning in about us potentially being shut down imminently.
[02:16:57.133 --> 02:16:59.636]  I believe it will happen that we already stopped them for now.
[02:17:00.796 --> 02:17:06.478]  But this epic moment about where we are, and Steve's an amazing guy, he tells the story, because of the pride of Satan.
[02:17:06.558 --> 02:17:07.659]  I was the same way when I was very young.
[02:17:08.219 --> 02:17:19.003]  Smart, good looking, he gets everything he wants, I was the same way, and all of a sudden Jesus literally appears to him, I just had it psychically, and says, no, you work for me now, and then he was given the thing.
[02:17:19.403 --> 02:17:22.164]  And when Steve tells those stories, I get that because I was the same way.
[02:17:22.544 --> 02:17:29.287]  I had everything, everyone did whatever I wanted, I was the boss, but it was all because it was an evil spirit.
[02:17:29.927 --> 02:17:30.808]  It was the devil.
[02:17:31.248 --> 02:17:37.273]  And as soon as I rejected that, yeah, I lost those weird sick powers, but they're nothing compared to the powers I got.
[02:17:37.653 --> 02:17:40.976]  And now as I get older, it's stronger and stronger.
[02:17:41.316 --> 02:17:42.237]  Steve, I love you.
[02:17:42.257 --> 02:17:43.618]  I appreciate you.
[02:17:43.678 --> 02:17:44.859]  Who knows what's going to happen now?
[02:17:45.239 --> 02:17:46.440]  I've spilt my guts here.
[02:17:46.721 --> 02:17:47.761]  We're in an epic moment.
[02:17:48.902 --> 02:17:50.444]  You talk about their attempt to shut us down.
[02:17:50.504 --> 02:17:51.024]  It's imminent.
[02:17:51.424 --> 02:17:52.065]  But just it does.
[02:17:52.145 --> 02:17:53.866]  It's such an epic moment.
[02:17:54.187 --> 02:17:55.267]  Nuclear war is imminent.
[02:17:55.528 --> 02:17:56.769]  Mainline News admits it.
[02:17:58.490 --> 02:18:00.833]  Well Alex, thank you so much and I think this is the most
[02:18:13.625 --> 02:18:17.026]  Nexus, meaning we're at a point where everything's intersecting.
[02:18:17.646 --> 02:18:27.809]  Just hours ago, Macron, the president of France, said in the next six days, by actually June 6, Europe is going to announce they're at war with Russia.
[02:18:28.189 --> 02:18:33.010]  Well, hello, they've already acted and they've already invoked Article 5.
[02:18:33.410 --> 02:18:35.571]  So I want to make something clear to everyone.
[02:18:36.131 --> 02:18:40.152]  They do what they do and then they say they're going to do it afterwards.
[02:18:40.752 --> 02:18:52.058]  This is the first time in history where we have actual demonstration of superior firepower, 11 nuclear subs of Russia off our Atlantic coast.
[02:18:52.098 --> 02:18:54.320]  We've got Poseidon nuclear torpedoes.
[02:18:54.340 --> 02:19:07.607]  Now this is important because the critical issue is, is that Russia has warned and warned and warned that when the West becomes an existential threat to their existence,
[02:19:08.406 --> 02:19:23.889]  Every single restraint is off the table and no one, listen, this is truth, no one has tried harder to defuse the nuclear rhetoric than Lavrov, Foreign Minister of Russia, then Medvedev, former President of Russia, and Vladimir Putin.
[02:19:24.169 --> 02:19:34.791]  Yet we're the ones that have got a crazy set of people that are basically rocking out instead of fiddling like Nero, you know, in the most dangerous time in history.
[02:19:35.291 --> 02:19:41.057]  And we're at this point now, and look, I agree with the times that we have.
[02:19:41.938 --> 02:19:46.643]  Nobody knows exactly, Alex, but let me share this, and thank you for having me on.
[02:19:46.923 --> 02:19:52.869]  Alex, you've been to the tip of the spear, and the bottom line that everyone's got to understand... But I've not been to the tip of the spear.
[02:19:52.889 --> 02:19:53.609]  It's not about me.
[02:19:53.649 --> 02:19:54.690]  It's recognizing who's right.
[02:19:55.391 --> 02:19:56.132]  You've told the testimony.
[02:19:56.152 --> 02:19:56.913]  I don't want to interrupt you.
[02:19:57.313 --> 02:19:58.614]  Explain just briefly.
[02:19:59.615 --> 02:20:00.716]  Literally the whole experience.
[02:20:01.097 --> 02:20:01.997]  I know your story you've told.
[02:20:02.017 --> 02:20:02.458]  I know it.
[02:20:02.478 --> 02:20:03.519]  I experienced it the same way.
[02:20:03.839 --> 02:20:05.401]  You were not a God follower.
[02:20:05.681 --> 02:20:11.626]  You didn't know you were Satanist, but you were following that, and God literally interdicted you as a weapon against them.
[02:20:12.107 --> 02:20:16.611]  That is so, and you literally, if people go back, we've got to find his interviews with me 27 years ago.
[02:20:16.991 --> 02:20:18.593]  This guy would come on, he predicted
[02:20:19.253 --> 02:20:22.855]  All the GMO, all the MNRA, all the shots, poisoning the food.
[02:20:23.496 --> 02:20:27.778]  Literally, people think I'll be able to get his clips because I don't care about me.
[02:20:27.878 --> 02:20:29.079]  Oh, Alex has all the best clips.
[02:20:29.299 --> 02:20:30.199]  He's the one that knows it all.
[02:20:30.499 --> 02:20:39.104]  This guy right here, literally like a laser beam, like landing a butterfly on an asteroid three miles away, nailed it every time.
[02:20:39.384 --> 02:20:42.446]  And he says it was Jesus Christ literally appeared.
[02:20:42.466 --> 02:20:43.307]  I would love that.
[02:20:43.407 --> 02:20:44.267]  I haven't had that happen yet.
[02:20:44.747 --> 02:20:45.428]  Explain this to them.
[02:20:46.846 --> 02:20:50.129]  Well, first of all, a testimony of Jesus is a spirit of prophecy.
[02:20:50.729 --> 02:21:03.019]  I was in college, I was the president of the most carnal, you know, wild-ass fraternity on campus, and I went to hear Hal Lindsey speak about Jesus.
[02:21:03.119 --> 02:21:06.262]  I'd never heard the name of Jesus except swearing.
[02:21:06.742 --> 02:21:13.388]  And he presented Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, and I was completely void of Christian knowledge.
[02:21:13.809 --> 02:21:27.020]  I asked Jesus to come into my heart, and Alex, the thing that blew me away of God's love and amazement is, Hal pointed me, I was in kind of the front row, and said, Jesus will forgive you of your sin.
[02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:33.126]  And I go, well, only Jesus can forgive me of my sin, because I know what I'm doing hours before.
[02:21:33.866 --> 02:21:40.950]  And then I went home to my mother's house and the presence of Jesus, the physical presence of Jesus, showed up in my room.
[02:21:41.010 --> 02:21:41.851]  I lived in the basement.
[02:21:41.911 --> 02:21:44.132]  I was like eight blocks away from the university.
[02:21:44.552 --> 02:21:50.075]  I fell on my face before the Lord and he lifted me up and said, Who are you, Lord?
[02:21:50.376 --> 02:21:56.039]  And he said, I am Jesus, your Savior, and I'm calling you to have a Joseph's ministry.
[02:21:56.059 --> 02:21:57.700]  I didn't even know who Joseph was.
[02:21:58.260 --> 02:22:00.902]  But when he pulled me up, I couldn't get up, you guys.
[02:22:00.922 --> 02:22:02.022]  I'm trying to do pushups.
[02:22:02.082 --> 02:22:02.703]  I can't get up.
[02:22:03.403 --> 02:22:06.345]  No, no, the presence of God puts you on your face.
[02:22:07.425 --> 02:22:08.186]  Absolutely.
[02:22:08.606 --> 02:22:14.569]  And when Alex, when I looked into the eyes of the Lord, every single cell in my body exploded.
[02:22:14.689 --> 02:22:19.112]  Every atom with love and forgiveness and absolute
[02:22:19.990 --> 02:22:22.231]  Astonishing things started happening to me.
[02:22:22.872 --> 02:22:24.613]  I was so ignorant, so dumb.
[02:22:24.673 --> 02:22:30.977]  You were being given the download, as I've had the same experience, because I was already, God saved me when I was 16, said you're in with Satan, stop.
[02:22:31.277 --> 02:22:32.998]  He pulled me away from it, made me stop what I was doing.
[02:22:33.278 --> 02:22:47.547]  But then a few years into what I was doing, I had this thing at a restaurant at night by myself, because it was about to close, they let me in, I'm eating, and it literally shoved me down on the table, and the guy with the mop is like, you're okay, because God was so strong, I was like shoved down.
[02:22:49.201 --> 02:22:53.083]  Well, the word doxa means the weight of God's glory.
[02:22:53.203 --> 02:22:54.424]  We get the word doxology.
[02:22:54.784 --> 02:22:59.266]  But what was amazing, the Lord gave me a panorama of history, okay?
[02:22:59.806 --> 02:23:01.827]  I am not a researcher of the Bible.
[02:23:01.847 --> 02:23:02.968]  So you got hit with a download?
[02:23:04.008 --> 02:23:04.549]  A download.
[02:23:04.569 --> 02:23:05.709]  That's the best word I know.
[02:23:06.129 --> 02:23:13.273]  My definition of download is where you have instant understanding and absolutely you don't have to think it through, you don't have to
[02:23:14.031 --> 02:23:14.531]  We're good.
[02:23:29.773 --> 02:23:35.138]  The interesting thing about this whole thing, my life was radically transformed.
[02:23:35.458 --> 02:23:41.403]  I said, I went from the gutter most, that's really an understatement, to the uttermost.
[02:23:41.823 --> 02:23:52.072]  And what was astonishing and just mind-blowing to me is that for three hours I sat, literally three hours, I sat in the presence of God, worshiping
[02:23:52.752 --> 02:23:59.434]  Someone I didn't know a couple hours before that, but the goodness of God led me to repentance.
[02:23:59.854 --> 02:24:03.295]  And when I was watching you last night, I was thanking the Lord.
[02:24:03.335 --> 02:24:04.796]  Listen, this isn't about Alex.
[02:24:04.836 --> 02:24:05.496]  It isn't about me.
[02:24:05.516 --> 02:24:06.877]  It isn't about any individual.
[02:24:07.257 --> 02:24:08.477]  It's about Jesus.
[02:24:08.937 --> 02:24:18.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, the hatred for the devil, all the demons in the world, and when you hear anybody talking about demons, that's a disembodied evil spirit.
[02:24:18.520 --> 02:24:37.161]  And we now see that the absolute vilification of Christians, the vilification of the truth, and so... Once again, to interrupt, we now know through science, they admit it, the left never even disagrees with us, it's interdimensional information, our DNA is a transceiver, we're receiving and transmitting, it's a channel we can tune into.
[02:24:37.841 --> 02:24:39.063]  We've got to tune into God.
[02:24:40.239 --> 02:24:44.281]  Yeah, and here's the thing, you do that in the name of Jesus, okay?
[02:24:44.661 --> 02:24:46.982]  No man comes to the Father except through the Son.
[02:24:47.382 --> 02:24:51.184]  But what's important, Jesus said, look, I'm going to show you all things.
[02:24:51.204 --> 02:25:02.789]  The Revelation, everybody quotes the book of Revelation, but it's the Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God the Father gave to John the Apostle, who was in exile on the Isle of Patmos.
[02:25:03.329 --> 02:25:17.720]  I'm more worried, Alex, right now, that we are going to see someone of the satanic family from hell initiating an attempted first strike on Russia, and they've already gone on record what they're going to do.
[02:25:18.060 --> 02:25:19.321]  Our weapons are inferior.
[02:25:19.341 --> 02:25:21.222]  Yeah, back to nuclear war.
[02:25:21.262 --> 02:25:21.763]  You're an expert.
[02:25:21.803 --> 02:25:22.163]  Explain that.
[02:25:22.483 --> 02:25:23.644]  I just want to be able to get straight here.
[02:25:24.044 --> 02:25:25.826]  This just means people don't know.
[02:25:25.846 --> 02:25:27.828]  Read your stuff 35 years ago.
[02:25:28.188 --> 02:25:29.149]  I wrote about you 30 years ago.
[02:25:29.169 --> 02:25:30.170]  I got you on 28 years ago.
[02:25:30.510 --> 02:25:30.990]  They don't know.
[02:25:31.070 --> 02:25:32.552]  You nailed it.
[02:25:32.612 --> 02:25:34.874]  So people say Alex Jones is right.
[02:25:35.154 --> 02:25:38.357]  We've got to have a project to get his videos and his radio interviews.
[02:25:39.097 --> 02:25:39.978]  I'll figure it out.
[02:25:40.338 --> 02:25:43.361]  It will blow people away and save so many people.
[02:25:43.901 --> 02:25:49.086]  So Steve Quill, get back to what you're saying about the current problem.
[02:25:50.177 --> 02:25:56.142]  Okay, our current problems are this, is that the United States intentionally committed millicide.
[02:25:56.202 --> 02:25:57.823]  That's a military suicide.
[02:25:58.243 --> 02:26:01.526]  The United States absolutely
[02:26:02.173 --> 02:26:04.934]  Killed all of our lead weapons programs.
[02:26:05.354 --> 02:26:13.418]  We put way more money into things like aircraft carriers, F-35s, which is the biggest military fiasco budget item.
[02:26:13.718 --> 02:26:21.902]  The military-industrial complex stayed, how should I say this, so inflexible that they couldn't keep up with electromagnetic warfare.
[02:26:22.162 --> 02:26:26.324]  They couldn't keep up with submarines, especially torpedoes, Alex.
[02:26:26.624 --> 02:26:31.686]  The Russians have super-squall torpedoes that go approximately nine times the speed
[02:26:32.066 --> 02:26:32.506]  Of U.S.
[02:26:32.566 --> 02:26:33.227]  torpedoes.
[02:26:33.647 --> 02:26:40.411]  And again, when President Putin said, there's nothing you have in the West that can defeat us, he's not bragging.
[02:26:40.491 --> 02:26:42.152]  He's trying to get people to understand.
[02:26:42.172 --> 02:26:56.941]  Look, I'm not a Russian agent, but when somebody tells me that, you know, he's defending Western Christianity, he believes in the family and all the things he's doing, then I see who's at war against you, me and the American people.
[02:26:57.141 --> 02:26:59.863]  By the way, I take the words of Jesus seriously.
[02:27:00.243 --> 02:27:06.285]  Blessed are the peacemakers, so they shall become the sons of God, or be called the sons of God.
[02:27:06.546 --> 02:27:11.027]  Gerald Zalente's trying to get people to say, no, no, no to war!
[02:27:11.387 --> 02:27:12.668]  But here's the tragedy.
[02:27:13.028 --> 02:27:22.912]  They have the ability, they being the globalists, under satanic control, every NATO member and head was at the most occult ceremony, what was it, almost eight years ago,
[02:27:23.012 --> 02:27:35.418]  So, today, eight years ago, June maybe 1st or 2nd, and in the long tunnel beneath the Swiss Alps, and the most demonic, the most… And then it's satanic ceremonies, the opening of CERN.
[02:27:35.939 --> 02:27:36.559]  This is real.
[02:27:37.559 --> 02:27:38.200]  This is real.
[02:27:38.580 --> 02:27:43.863]  And so, in essence, the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God.
[02:27:44.063 --> 02:27:46.304]  But the truth is what they hate more than anything.
[02:27:46.784 --> 02:27:47.965]  They hate the truth.
[02:27:48.145 --> 02:27:52.148]  Jesus said he is the truth, the way and the life, but they hate truth tellers.
[02:27:52.628 --> 02:27:57.731]  And this is why, ladies and gentlemen, the war, especially in Canada, is against Christians.
[02:27:58.572 --> 02:28:04.036]  Women are going to prison for simply praying outside an abortion clinic.
[02:28:04.416 --> 02:28:07.398]  Quoting the scripture is considered hate crimes.
[02:28:07.778 --> 02:28:13.262]  And Ann announces, Alex, almost, I don't know, 40 years ago, that the day would come
[02:28:13.985 --> 02:28:23.852]  And I believe it's now here, where the possession of a Bible will become a capital offense, the recitation of Scripture will be, in essence, a capital offense.
[02:28:23.872 --> 02:28:27.014]  And Europe's banning the Bible, the UK's banning it, Canada's.
[02:28:27.034 --> 02:28:29.436]  We'll come right back with the incredible Steve Quayle.
[02:28:29.936 --> 02:28:31.217]  These guys are riding shotgun.
[02:28:31.657 --> 02:28:32.798]  I mean, folks, it's real.
[02:28:33.158 --> 02:28:34.318]  Only God is going to save us.
[02:28:34.438 --> 02:28:44.142]  Only Jesus Christ, who is God's intercessor, his missionary to us, his projection of himself down to humble himself to show us, only Jesus can save us.
[02:28:44.302 --> 02:28:45.602]  Jesus, we love you.
[02:28:45.882 --> 02:28:46.502]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:46.622 --> 02:28:47.663]  We pray to you, Jesus.
[02:28:47.703 --> 02:28:48.503]  We love you, Jesus.
[02:28:52.734 --> 02:28:57.478]  If you don't get a high-quality gravity-fed filter from Infowarstore.com, please just get one.

[02:29:13.393 --> 02:29:16.256]  The tap water, the well water, it is a witch's brew.

[02:29:47.095 --> 02:29:57.304]  Good evening America.
[02:29:58.072 --> 02:30:01.656]  I thought we'd take some time out of our daily lives and sit down for a nice little chat.
[02:30:02.016 --> 02:30:03.958]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[02:30:04.258 --> 02:30:07.762]  I suspect now even calls are being placed from the White House to members of Big Tech.
[02:30:08.042 --> 02:30:11.846]  I can almost hear George Takai and Stephen King tweeting furiously on their phones.
[02:30:11.946 --> 02:30:14.368]  And very soon, federal agents will be on their way.
[02:30:15.009 --> 02:30:15.289]  Why?
[02:30:15.570 --> 02:30:20.213]  Because words lead us to the truth, and the truth is, there is something very wrong with this country, isn't there?
[02:30:20.553 --> 02:30:28.920]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression, and where once you had the freedom to object, until now you have had censors and systems of surveillance, coercing your conformity and soliciting your submission.
[02:30:29.380 --> 02:30:30.101]  How did this happen?
[02:30:30.681 --> 02:30:31.542]  Who's to blame?
[02:30:31.862 --> 02:30:35.725]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable.
[02:30:36.106 --> 02:30:40.589]  But truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[02:30:41.670 --> 02:30:42.731]  Oh, I know why you did it.
[02:30:42.952 --> 02:30:44.453]  You were afraid of the Orange Man.
[02:30:44.854 --> 02:30:45.455]  Who wouldn't be?
[02:30:45.875 --> 02:30:48.698]  Mean tweets, funny jokes, and fights with Rosie O'Donnell.
[02:30:48.959 --> 02:30:53.043]  They got the better of you, and in your panic you turned to Joseph Robinette Biden.
[02:30:53.737 --> 02:31:01.763]  He promised you war, he promised to forgive your student debts and make reparations for slavery, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[02:31:02.443 --> 02:31:08.528]  So if you have seen nothing, if the crimes of this government remain unknown to you, then I would suggest you allow the 5th of November to pass unmarked.
[02:31:09.248 --> 02:31:22.618]  But if you see as I see, if you feel as I feel, if you would seek as I seek, then I ask you to stand beside me at the ballot box, and together we shall give them a 5th of November that shall never, ever be forgot.
[02:31:30.430 --> 02:31:31.612]  There is a war.
[02:31:32.113 --> 02:31:33.115]  It's happening now.
[02:31:33.996 --> 02:31:35.799]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[02:31:36.380 --> 02:31:38.163]  The time to choose sides has come.
[02:31:38.944 --> 02:31:40.386]  We are the Resistance.
[02:31:40.847 --> 02:31:42.390]  We are the Infowar.
[02:31:52.501 --> 02:31:57.844]  Everybody knows, unless you've been hiding in a cave somewhere for 20 years, that fish oil does incredible things.
[02:31:58.324 --> 02:31:59.985]  But not all fish oil is created equal.
[02:32:00.525 --> 02:32:09.170]  Most fish oil has been pasteurized, it's been boiled, it's been heated up, and they smash the bones and guts of the fish, and it gets contaminants in it.
[02:32:09.750 --> 02:32:20.996]  We sell the highest grade fish oil there is, and it's pure fish oil, and it's not been pasteurized, and it is so good for your whole body, your cardiovascular system, your brain, energy, everything.

[02:33:59.321 --> 02:34:00.822]  All right, Steve Quayle is our guest.
[02:34:00.902 --> 02:34:04.164]  We are living in epic times, and it's all a spiritual war.
[02:34:04.884 --> 02:34:06.145]  Steve, you got interrupted by the break.
[02:34:06.165 --> 02:34:06.725]  Please continue.
[02:34:08.226 --> 02:34:14.429]  Well, again, it is a spiritual war, but it's being carried out and fought on planet Earth.
[02:34:14.610 --> 02:34:27.897]  Alex, I'm putting up a timer on my website starting tomorrow, and I'm so concerned, not only the 6th of June, because obviously that's when Macron says that the official declaration of war against Russia is going to be made,
[02:34:28.297 --> 02:34:30.379]  Yeah, it's a big deal and nobody's talking about it.
[02:34:30.399 --> 02:34:32.141]  Putin's like, well, we're going to go ahead and nuke you then.
[02:34:32.201 --> 02:34:33.882]  The issue is nuclear war is a big deal.
[02:34:33.942 --> 02:34:35.144]  And ladies and gentlemen, we are watching
[02:34:48.616 --> 02:34:52.798]  A repeat of history that you cannot deny.
[02:34:53.119 --> 02:34:55.280]  This is not going to be like Pearl Harbor.
[02:34:55.700 --> 02:35:02.604]  The Russians have given us every target they're going to hit from New York to Washington, D.C., every single defense factory.
[02:35:03.386 --> 02:35:09.912]  Every single aspect... Just like the Germans in World War I published a month before the sinking of the Lusitania.
[02:35:09.952 --> 02:35:12.394]  The Lusitania is a secret flagship of the British.
[02:35:12.754 --> 02:35:14.396]  It's shipping weapons from America to England.
[02:35:14.676 --> 02:35:15.397]  We will sink it.
[02:35:15.797 --> 02:35:18.820]  And they cruised it in front of the submarines hoping they would sink it.
[02:35:18.860 --> 02:35:19.080]  Go ahead.
[02:35:20.342 --> 02:35:24.364]  Well, and that's exactly what is going on right now, everyone.
[02:35:24.704 --> 02:35:26.665]  It's not like Russia's sitting around.
[02:35:26.905 --> 02:35:28.186]  They're telling us what they're going to do.
[02:35:28.646 --> 02:35:33.789]  One of their submarines, the Black Hole, has literally surfaced right next to a U.S.
[02:35:33.869 --> 02:35:34.629]  aircraft carrier.
[02:35:34.969 --> 02:35:37.991]  Then it has submerged and gone, and we can't even track it.
[02:35:38.542 --> 02:35:49.049]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, when you've got a torpedo, now this is critical, called the Poseidon, that's more of a nuclear underwater drone with 100 megaton nuclear weapon.
[02:35:49.089 --> 02:36:00.476]  That was denied by the highest offices of the Pentagon until, guess what, the British took it serious because they actually saw a Poseidon nuclear torpedo.
[02:36:00.496 --> 02:36:06.700]  And let's be clear, that can't be shot down by anti-missile systems, so they hit New York with that, all of New York's gone.
[02:36:07.982 --> 02:36:12.186]  Yeah, and more importantly, Britain took it seriously and the U.S.
[02:36:12.246 --> 02:36:13.287]  was mocking Britain.
[02:36:13.808 --> 02:36:16.911]  It cannot be tracked.
[02:36:16.971 --> 02:36:19.573]  A 1,500 to 2,500 foot radioactive wave.
[02:36:19.633 --> 02:36:21.855]  Talk about surfing the apocalypse, okay?
[02:36:22.296 --> 02:36:26.260]  And it's going to be so, how should I say this, astonishing.
[02:36:26.400 --> 02:36:31.845]  Here's the deal, ladies and gentlemen, the globalists, Alex has talked about it, I've talked to Mikey Adams, everybody's been talking about it.
[02:36:32.205 --> 02:36:37.670]  They want every human being dead, replaced by a conglomerate.
[02:36:38.110 --> 02:36:39.451]  And Martin Zuckerberg and Oliver.
[02:36:39.811 --> 02:36:40.772]  Listen, I've been to Hawaii.
[02:36:40.792 --> 02:36:41.393]  I love Hawaii.
[02:36:41.433 --> 02:36:42.133]  I go once a year.
[02:36:42.714 --> 02:36:43.514]  The locals love me.
[02:36:43.554 --> 02:36:45.576]  I hang out with all the chiefs of the Hawaiians.
[02:36:45.656 --> 02:36:46.497]  It's great people.
[02:36:47.619 --> 02:36:52.961]  They're like, Zuckerberg has built, not a 10 story, they say it's so giant, three years they've been building it.
[02:36:53.381 --> 02:37:00.563]  And pilots that were there with the Hawaiian chief and all this stuff, and I haven't shown the video yet, I haven't, of like 20 dump trucks leaving, 20 coming.
[02:37:00.703 --> 02:37:03.584]  They're building a giant bunker there with a submarine base.
[02:37:04.464 --> 02:37:06.685]  They're acting like they're going to be prepared in there, Steve.
[02:37:07.981 --> 02:37:09.822]  Well, first of all, he's building on the wrong island.
[02:37:09.862 --> 02:37:13.164]  Kauai has the Pacific Missile Theater Range.
[02:37:13.525 --> 02:37:16.547]  Obviously, that's where Edward Snowden was, the NSA headquarters.
[02:37:16.807 --> 02:37:21.230]  Yeah, that's the main nuclear base and counter-nuclear base.
[02:37:21.770 --> 02:37:22.811]  Kauai is a total target.
[02:37:23.936 --> 02:37:36.287]  Well, yeah, and it's the prime target because it controls everything in space, everything on the surface of the water, everything under the water, and right now there are Chinese, I'm told, subs and Russian subs.
[02:37:36.307 --> 02:37:37.829]  That is ground zero.
[02:37:38.009 --> 02:37:41.432]  I don't care how deep Zuckerberg's place is.
[02:37:41.472 --> 02:37:43.514]  He's building it on the wrong island, Alex.
[02:37:43.914 --> 02:37:47.738]  But again— You know the Russians and Chinese have targeted his house, Renwick.
[02:37:48.956 --> 02:37:50.477]  Yeah, well, I can tell you this.
[02:37:50.637 --> 02:37:52.097]  I flew over years ago.
[02:37:52.137 --> 02:37:53.278]  This is an important story.
[02:37:53.598 --> 02:37:57.819]  I flew over the Pacific Missile Theory Range's radar domes.
[02:37:57.879 --> 02:37:58.960]  And by the way, I'm interrupting you.
[02:37:59.100 --> 02:38:00.020]  No one knows this.
[02:38:00.100 --> 02:38:01.161]  It's not in the news.
[02:38:01.541 --> 02:38:07.183]  There's a giant nuclear weapons missile base on the eastern side towards Japan of Kauai.
[02:38:07.823 --> 02:38:10.944]  No one knows there's giant NSA bases under the mountains.
[02:38:11.364 --> 02:38:12.925]  That's not really put out there.
[02:38:13.385 --> 02:38:15.406]  You have the knowledge.
[02:38:16.516 --> 02:38:19.737]  Well, I have the knowledge because I'm flying over it with a helicopter pilot.
[02:38:19.998 --> 02:38:37.305]  They turn on the OTH, the over-the-horizon radar at that point, I forget how many years ago, at least eight years ago, and I was in the helicopter, I'm listening to my headphones, and I heard the Holy Spirit, the same Spirit of God that I'd heard before, saying, this is where World War III starts.
[02:38:38.105 --> 02:38:43.187]  Now, that's interesting, because if you take out— And notice how I brought up Hawaii, and now you brought up that information.
[02:38:43.207 --> 02:38:44.068]  See, that's the Holy Spirit.
[02:38:44.990 --> 02:38:48.152]  Yep, and so here's what I want people to understand.
[02:38:49.732 --> 02:38:55.455]  Just because the knowledge isn't mainstream doesn't mean it's not true.
[02:38:56.255 --> 02:39:03.218]  And the goal, thank you for putting that up, whoever chose that, is to inform.
[02:39:03.298 --> 02:39:06.600]  You know, God said, Alex, his people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.
[02:39:07.060 --> 02:39:10.042]  He didn't say that, well, you know, they're pretty smart, but they don't do anything.
[02:39:10.263 --> 02:39:17.468]  But God basically said, not because He doesn't present what's going to happen, but because they reject what's going to happen.
[02:39:17.848 --> 02:39:19.630]  So this is why it's a critical factor.
[02:39:19.650 --> 02:39:21.771]  God gives us free will, but He gives us a cheat sheet.
[02:39:22.892 --> 02:39:23.072]  Yep.
[02:39:23.452 --> 02:39:29.377]  And so what we're talking about today on your show with what's going on in the background
[02:39:29.898 --> 02:39:38.424]  Truth must be silenced at all costs, because we're seeing the EU, European Union, we're seeing all of the monsters.
[02:39:38.504 --> 02:39:39.905]  I'm calling them monsters, you guys.
[02:39:39.925 --> 02:39:41.766]  When I say monsters, I believe they're hybrids.
[02:39:42.107 --> 02:39:44.588]  I believe the majority of them are demon-possessed.
[02:39:44.909 --> 02:39:49.752]  And if you want to know what a demon is, it's a disembodied spirit that takes control of a human being.
[02:39:50.212 --> 02:39:54.836]  We have over 30 years, Alex, you and I and whoever else is old,
[02:39:55.356 --> 02:39:58.418]  You said over and over again, soon it's going to get much worse.
[02:39:58.798 --> 02:40:01.259]  The gates of hells will be open and it's going to get much worse.
[02:40:01.279 --> 02:40:06.522]  And that's what I see is even low-level leftists now are like demons and they're all communicating and they know what they're doing.
[02:40:07.823 --> 02:40:10.244]  Well, it's the devil's time clock now, okay?
[02:40:11.025 --> 02:40:12.926]  We're on the devil's time clock.
[02:40:13.446 --> 02:40:16.988]  And unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, you know, you can deny it.
[02:40:17.829 --> 02:40:21.771]  You can argue, is this a great tribulation or is this one of the minor tribulations?
[02:40:22.563 --> 02:40:24.626]  I'm worried, Alex, and I truly am.
[02:40:24.946 --> 02:40:28.511]  I've given it over to God, but I'm contending for people to understand.
[02:40:28.531 --> 02:40:39.043]  No, world government, Mark of the Beast, World Castle Society, John of Patmos, all being fulfilled, and I go to the average, I go to a lot of churches, and they'll talk, they won't, it's all a fun time.
[02:40:39.083 --> 02:40:40.625]  They will not tell you where you're at.
[02:40:40.846 --> 02:40:41.046]  Right.
[02:40:42.765 --> 02:40:49.588]  Well, I think one of the most important things to remember is it's not a lack of faith to prepare.
[02:40:49.608 --> 02:40:52.269]  I tell some people that say, oh, you don't have faith.
[02:40:52.669 --> 02:40:57.792]  No, Noah moved by faith to preparing an ark for his family.
[02:40:58.352 --> 02:41:00.893]  Obviously, Joseph storing up grain.
[02:41:00.933 --> 02:41:05.155]  And again, we're given those stories that happened as everything repeats, as you know.
[02:41:05.595 --> 02:41:06.355]  You're the master.
[02:41:07.156 --> 02:41:08.276]  God's telling us to get prepared.
[02:41:08.296 --> 02:41:09.817]  Yep.
[02:41:10.097 --> 02:41:12.298]  And again, this is what's so critical.
[02:41:13.391 --> 02:41:26.683]  We have, by the grace of God, got to give the clarion call to everyone to start realizing no one's coming to their rescue except Jesus, except the God of Heaven.
[02:41:26.823 --> 02:41:38.693]  And ladies and gentlemen, this country sat back as the demon rats, the Democrats, and what I call now the Republicans, a name only, zombie cons, allowed the Democrats to make war on God.
[02:41:39.273 --> 02:41:54.047]  And Alex, years ago, I think it was the second time or third time I was on your show, the Air Force Academy was basically kicking out Christians, kicking out any kind of biblical authority, and what happened, I made a statement.
[02:41:54.327 --> 02:41:54.727]  Thank you.
[02:42:10.852 --> 02:42:14.135]  Satanists, Druid priests, that was welcome.
[02:42:14.555 --> 02:42:24.324]  And so now we're seeing this happen, and what we're not getting the truth in the United States, ladies and gentlemen, is that Russia has electronic warfare dominance.
[02:42:24.644 --> 02:42:26.706]  That is not propaganda.
[02:42:26.786 --> 02:42:32.211]  We're seeing it when the entire GPS system over the Ukraine goes down, or Western Europe.
[02:42:32.551 --> 02:42:35.554]  We're seeing it played out in real time.
[02:42:36.034 --> 02:42:47.428]  And so, if you have a weapon that basically disables all the other nations' weapons, I don't think it's smart to go throwing punches at the bear.
[02:42:47.469 --> 02:42:48.250]  No, I totally agree.
[02:42:48.270 --> 02:42:49.551]  They want to overturn the whole table.
[02:42:49.571 --> 02:42:50.512]  Steve, we love you.
[02:42:50.913 --> 02:42:52.615]  We appreciate your support at SteveQuill.com.
[02:42:53.726 --> 02:42:54.807]  I don't think we'll be shutting down tomorrow.
[02:42:54.847 --> 02:42:55.747]  The judge could do it.
[02:42:57.628 --> 02:43:02.791]  But, I mean, they already tried to shut it down Friday and today, but they didn't have the order, which I explained in law.
[02:43:03.131 --> 02:43:07.753]  So the security coverage that's private that I brought in here was being ordered because it's paid by the CRO.
[02:43:08.354 --> 02:43:09.354]  Join me again tomorrow.
[02:43:09.374 --> 02:43:11.235]  I'll probably do six, seven hours tomorrow.
[02:43:11.555 --> 02:43:13.536]  I want to do a full hour with you.
[02:43:13.976 --> 02:43:15.197]  It's a very precious time.
[02:43:15.357 --> 02:43:16.778]  God's giving us this giant audience.
[02:43:17.098 --> 02:43:18.699]  Instead of whining about what's happening to us,
[02:43:19.179 --> 02:43:21.861]  I think the most important information we've got needs to be heard.
[02:43:22.001 --> 02:43:26.065]  And I'm going to say this again, because it's not me just saying this to be nice to a guest that's here.
[02:43:26.765 --> 02:43:31.189]  Your interviews, you've been on the air 40 years, you just said.
[02:43:31.549 --> 02:43:34.051]  I've been interviewing you 27, 28 years.
[02:43:34.071 --> 02:43:35.592]  You're one of the first big guests I ever get on.
[02:43:35.972 --> 02:43:37.073]  And I thought you were really smart.
[02:43:37.113 --> 02:43:38.755]  I knew a lot of stuff I knew you were saying was true.
[02:43:39.035 --> 02:43:39.936]  I was like, this is true.
[02:43:40.476 --> 02:43:42.177]  You are so important.
[02:43:42.237 --> 02:43:46.020]  If you can tell me, or you can send me, while we still have this big crew and everything,
[02:43:46.921 --> 02:43:50.122]  The most important things, as I've read your books, then it becomes memory.
[02:43:50.142 --> 02:43:51.383]  I gotta go reread them again.
[02:43:51.403 --> 02:43:51.943]  That takes time.
[02:43:52.263 --> 02:44:02.447]  If you'll just send me some of your earlier interviews from 20 years ago, 30 years ago, I want to put those out on X because I know the stuff where I predicted tyranny has had hundreds of millions of views.
[02:44:02.808 --> 02:44:05.609]  I mean, some videos, you know, they go up, they get 20 million views, they take them down.
[02:44:05.889 --> 02:44:10.291]  But overall, like some individual videos are like 500 million views where I made predictions.
[02:44:10.331 --> 02:44:10.931]  What was it hard at?
[02:44:10.971 --> 02:44:11.711]  Operation Lockstep.
[02:44:12.351 --> 02:44:13.072]  I want to
[02:44:14.694 --> 02:44:16.478]  Absolutely flood the zone with Steve Quayle.
[02:44:16.939 --> 02:44:19.765]  So, you send us that stuff, brother, and we love you, okay?
[02:44:20.836 --> 02:44:25.418]  Well thank you Alex, and I don't know that I have access to all my files.
[02:44:25.458 --> 02:44:29.240]  I've got like 9,000 hours of cassettes and VHS and everything.
[02:44:29.540 --> 02:44:32.882]  But I can tell you this, I'll send you, this is Midnight Strikes.
[02:44:32.902 --> 02:44:40.426]  This is a book, a guy sat down and said, Daniel Holdings, terrific author, and said, tell me everything that the Lord told you.
[02:44:40.786 --> 02:44:42.847]  Some of the stuff I sat on for 30 years.
[02:44:43.147 --> 02:44:44.928]  I'll send you a summary sheet.
[02:44:45.288 --> 02:44:45.929]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:45:04.602 --> 02:45:11.046]  Yeah, that guy literally would say this stuff like 27 years ago on my show, and I was just like, it all happened.
[02:45:11.146 --> 02:45:12.647]  He was just so far ahead of the curve.
[02:45:13.228 --> 02:45:13.888]  It's crazy.
[02:45:14.048 --> 02:45:16.310]  I mean, that guy, that guy is like, amazing.
[02:45:16.550 --> 02:45:23.094]  All right, we have got Viva Frye and Robert Barnes with their popular syndicated show Simulcasting with us.
[02:45:23.114 --> 02:45:24.515]  We got a little bit late because Jack was late.
[02:45:24.535 --> 02:45:25.416]  We got behind here.
[02:45:25.776 --> 02:45:26.457]  That's okay.
[02:45:26.637 --> 02:45:28.218]  I want to try to bring in Viva Barnes.
[02:45:28.238 --> 02:45:34.302]  I want to try to, the show's Viva Barnes, but I want to bring in Viva Frye and Robert Barnes, two good friends of mine, two great people.
[02:45:34.882 --> 02:45:35.443]  Uh, right now.
[02:45:35.463 --> 02:45:36.043]  Hey, guys.
[02:45:38.304 --> 02:45:39.285]  Oh, we're told 30 seconds.
[02:45:39.305 --> 02:45:39.485]  Okay.
[02:45:40.225 --> 02:45:43.548]  So I want to get, we have to go back to us because everybody's tuning in to hear about what's happening here.
[02:45:43.568 --> 02:45:45.989]  I just love these idiots on the internet.
[02:45:46.429 --> 02:45:48.351]  Obviously being paid, obviously a paid deal.
[02:45:48.771 --> 02:45:49.791]  Oh, this is all made up.
[02:45:49.811 --> 02:45:50.452]  You want me to shut down?
[02:45:50.472 --> 02:45:50.892]  Blah, blah, blah.
[02:45:50.932 --> 02:45:51.312]  Yeah, right.
[02:45:51.693 --> 02:45:52.033]  You're here.
[02:45:52.073 --> 02:45:53.694]  You see the security saying, yeah, we're told to shut you down.
[02:45:53.714 --> 02:45:54.514]  What's going on?
[02:45:54.915 --> 02:45:56.295]  I mean, they're going to look like fools.
[02:45:56.856 --> 02:45:58.317]  I wish it wasn't happening when this place closes.
[02:45:59.022 --> 02:46:14.902]  Yeah, well, there were so many things that I wanted to say over the course of the last couple of conversations, and one of the things that came to mind specifically when we were speaking with the last gentleman was how we have genes that activate only when we're exposed to stress.
[02:46:15.863 --> 02:46:19.525]  And when I learned that I was listening to a Jordan Pearson lecture.
[02:46:20.205 --> 02:46:27.229]  This is why Russia is outperforming the United States because they've had a little bit of a rougher time and so their people are, they have more ingenuity and they're more creative.
[02:46:27.249 --> 02:46:28.149]  Strong men make good jobs.
[02:46:28.229 --> 02:46:28.910]  Right, exactly.
[02:46:28.950 --> 02:46:31.411]  And that's why I'm excited about what's happening to us.
[02:46:32.191 --> 02:46:34.734]  And that's, I learned from this myself a couple of years ago.
[02:46:34.754 --> 02:46:38.517]  That's why Texas, the military, always wanted Texas as the closest war zone.
[02:46:38.537 --> 02:46:45.623]  I got so much smarter when I stopped making money a couple of years ago and I had a hard time and I'm just, this is going to waken up some amazing things in you Alex.
[02:46:45.643 --> 02:46:47.245]  I think this is going to be a really good opportunity for us.
[02:46:47.265 --> 02:46:49.467]  Alright, we got Robert Barnes and Viva Fry here.
[02:46:50.948 --> 02:46:51.948]  This is the crossover.
[02:46:52.008 --> 02:46:55.389]  The world did not know it needed, but it's going to get right now regardless.
[02:46:55.869 --> 02:46:56.410]  Look at this inception.
[02:46:56.430 --> 02:46:57.390]  Yeah, sorry I went to you late.
[02:46:57.590 --> 02:46:58.890]  Everything got behind and late.
[02:46:59.310 --> 02:47:01.031]  Guys, everybody wants to know about what's happening here.
[02:47:01.051 --> 02:47:02.351]  You're both two great lawyers.
[02:47:02.691 --> 02:47:03.572]  Barn's a current lawyer.
[02:47:03.632 --> 02:47:06.212]  You're, you know, I don't want to talk about, but you're really smart, Viva.
[02:47:06.492 --> 02:47:08.713]  Like you said, you're not just a great talk show host.
[02:47:08.733 --> 02:47:10.033]  You are not obnoxious.
[02:47:10.053 --> 02:47:11.094]  You're the most intrepid.
[02:47:11.594 --> 02:47:12.094]  I love you.
[02:47:12.994 --> 02:47:15.855]  And you remind me like a, you know, like a... I love it, Alex.
[02:47:16.235 --> 02:47:20.139]  You remind me of like a honey badger, you know, killing a goat or something.
[02:47:20.159 --> 02:47:24.622]  But the point, or killing a lion, the point is, this is the takedown happening.
[02:47:25.003 --> 02:47:27.745]  Barnes told me years ago, it's all right, we're going to do this, blah, blah, blah.
[02:47:28.426 --> 02:47:29.407]  And here we are.
[02:47:29.567 --> 02:47:35.332]  What do you think their insane attack on us, because you nailed it, Viva, signifies for what's coming in the future?
[02:47:36.584 --> 02:47:41.985]  Well, Alex, I'm going to stroke Robert's ego for a second, because for those who don't know, let me see.
[02:47:42.165 --> 02:47:42.885]  Hold on.
[02:47:42.905 --> 02:47:44.325]  We're going to live with Double Viva.
[02:47:45.626 --> 02:47:56.728]  Apparently, whoever came down to shut down Infowars out in Texas, Robert was saying a while back, if you stay in Texas, even in Austin, you're not necessarily going to be safe from the lawfare.
[02:47:57.208 --> 02:48:00.388]  So who came, Alex, to put a padlock on the door?
[02:48:00.428 --> 02:48:01.288]  Was it the CRO?
[02:48:01.348 --> 02:48:02.949]  Was it someone from the court?
[02:48:02.989 --> 02:48:03.449]  Who was it?
[02:48:03.529 --> 02:48:04.369]  No, it was the CRO.
[02:48:05.469 --> 02:48:15.756]  I'm not a bankruptcy lawyer like Barnes is and an IRS expert, but it's a 100% clear cut that in an LLC like Infowars, I am the sole member.
[02:48:15.916 --> 02:48:16.676]  I make the decisions.
[02:48:16.696 --> 02:48:18.538]  So you can't shut this down or fire people without me.
[02:48:18.838 --> 02:48:20.059]  This guy behaved like that.
[02:48:20.359 --> 02:48:24.782]  So I learned because I'm like, I saw weird behavior by the security guys.
[02:48:24.802 --> 02:48:29.705]  It's an outside company that I had for years, but now this guy's going around, you know, attacking me.
[02:48:30.779 --> 02:48:31.379]  They were looking at me.
[02:48:31.659 --> 02:48:33.020]  I just picked up, something's going on.
[02:48:33.080 --> 02:48:37.042]  So I made some calls and they're like, yeah, we just learned they're shutting it down at 9pm tonight.
[02:48:37.423 --> 02:48:40.724]  So it was the CRO that was going to close us tonight.
[02:48:40.784 --> 02:48:42.045]  Even the judge didn't say do it.
[02:48:42.285 --> 02:48:43.366]  There's a hearing in two weeks.
[02:48:43.406 --> 02:48:44.566]  He was going to continue us on.
[02:48:45.067 --> 02:48:50.469]  So some desperate message came in and then the same CRO has literally, in my opinion,
[02:48:51.670 --> 02:48:53.631]  When I say opinion, that's a little proviso.
[02:48:54.152 --> 02:48:58.495]  Literally tried to set me up, as Barnes warned me, they'll try to put you in jail through this.
[02:48:58.535 --> 02:49:02.198]  They have the Justice Department involved, my depositions, all of it, which they never do.
[02:49:02.258 --> 02:49:03.799]  Like a one in a thousand show.
[02:49:03.819 --> 02:49:11.845]  But they couldn't find anything because I'm completely a straight, you know, Barnes, he didn't like client privilege being given up, but Barnes was, you know, doesn't lawyer advice for me.
[02:49:12.225 --> 02:49:20.211]  He looked at our books, had a big law firm do it, said, you underpaid, you overpaid taxes $7 million, you should put in a thing for that, get that back.
[02:49:20.811 --> 02:49:21.351]  It was true.
[02:49:37.697 --> 02:49:42.160]  You know, all the rest of the stuff that went on, I went and told the FBI about it because they're the ones doing it to say, you better stop.
[02:49:42.521 --> 02:49:43.822]  So it's on record, I'm a part of it.
[02:49:44.122 --> 02:49:46.964]  But this, this is all part of the same stuff we've seen with Trump.
[02:49:47.244 --> 02:49:52.328]  This is an epic total assault, and it has totally exploded in their face right now.
[02:49:52.408 --> 02:49:53.509]  So you guys just talk about it.
[02:49:53.769 --> 02:49:57.652]  And I'm listening to you, I got an earpiece, but I've been sitting here for two hours, I gotta take a piss.
[02:49:57.972 --> 02:50:02.916]  So I'm listening to, you know, Viva Frye, Robert Barnes, you take it away.
[02:50:03.610 --> 02:50:06.031]  Just make sure your mic is off before you go to the bathroom, Alex.
[02:50:06.071 --> 02:50:10.472]  Yeah, that was like when I was over at Elon Musk, and Vivek Ramaswamy starts pissing.
[02:50:10.492 --> 02:50:12.592]  I could see it was him, and he goes, sorry.
[02:50:13.052 --> 02:50:16.053]  And then they said, well, Viva Frye just... or no, not Viva.
[02:50:16.393 --> 02:50:18.954]  Vivek Ramaswamy just dominated this whole discussion.
[02:50:20.134 --> 02:50:21.334]  Robert, can you explain?
[02:50:21.814 --> 02:50:25.935]  Some people were positing that the CRO was coming in on behalf of an unpaid creditor.
[02:50:26.455 --> 02:50:31.777]  And my understanding is, even if that's true, the unpaid creditor still needs to get court-appointed authorization.
[02:50:31.797 --> 02:50:32.937]  Yeah, no, it's not even that.
[02:50:34.603 --> 02:50:37.924]  And I'm not a lawyer, but my lawyers are like, God, you know more than we do, because I'm in it all the time.
[02:50:37.964 --> 02:50:38.764]  I've learned it.
[02:50:40.585 --> 02:50:47.406]  They, my dad's lawyers, because he has a debt owed to him because they haven't paid him for supplements.
[02:50:47.806 --> 02:50:48.887]  So that's in front of them.
[02:50:49.547 --> 02:50:53.428]  They were saying to them in the last three months, hey, you better keep it in federal court.
[02:50:53.448 --> 02:50:55.008]  And I gave it to Judge Gwerrick Gamble in Austin.
[02:50:55.028 --> 02:50:56.688]  So shut it down right away.
[02:50:56.829 --> 02:50:59.249]  I've talked to outside lawyers, the top people.
[02:50:59.289 --> 02:51:00.209]  I went and consulted.
[02:51:00.289 --> 02:51:01.930]  I've spent days, you know.
[02:51:02.870 --> 02:51:02.970]  Yeah.
[02:51:21.528 --> 02:51:25.411]  They have, he just keeps talking about everything's fine, we're fine, we're fine.
[02:51:25.792 --> 02:51:30.796]  And then they got panicked in the last few days and tried to padlock the company at 9pm.
[02:51:30.876 --> 02:51:32.417]  I just found out about it and shut it down.
[02:51:32.857 --> 02:51:34.659]  So I don't know all the moving parts.
[02:51:34.759 --> 02:51:35.880]  It's hard to figure out.
[02:51:36.220 --> 02:51:38.042]  But something happened after the Trump conviction.
[02:51:38.062 --> 02:51:40.584]  We were in full war, 150 something days from the election.
[02:51:41.024 --> 02:51:43.086]  And so I can't explain that.
[02:51:43.546 --> 02:51:44.307]  All I know is,
[02:51:45.626 --> 02:51:48.527]  I was in bankruptcy when InfoWars was.
[02:51:48.547 --> 02:51:49.407]  That was two years ago.
[02:51:49.907 --> 02:51:51.748]  And then six months in, I declared bankruptcy.
[02:51:51.768 --> 02:51:52.508]  I said, I'm out of money.
[02:51:53.469 --> 02:51:56.630]  And I had some sponsors that were paying me directly.
[02:51:56.690 --> 02:51:57.710]  Most of the sponsorship was there.
[02:51:57.990 --> 02:52:01.251]  So they killed the $12 million in sponsorship as soon as the CRO got in.
[02:52:02.032 --> 02:52:04.392]  And then they said, oh, you just keep that money.
[02:52:04.632 --> 02:52:05.253]  I went to my lawyers.
[02:52:05.313 --> 02:52:06.413]  I said, I'm not going to keep this money.
[02:52:06.433 --> 02:52:06.913]  Am I allowed to do that?
[02:52:06.933 --> 02:52:08.074]  They go, no, this is crazy.
[02:52:08.494 --> 02:52:11.815]  So they're in meetings and recording it.
[02:52:12.155 --> 02:52:13.595]  And they're like, no, you just keep that money.
[02:52:13.916 --> 02:52:14.756]  We can't keep the money.
[02:52:15.723 --> 02:52:30.784]  So that all goes through, and then he goes and follows the report of the court that we were stealing money last year, and we're like, we already filed the court, you dumb bastard, that we have this money, we're trying to get you to take it, and we have these witnesses and my lawyers
[02:52:31.929 --> 02:52:34.972]  We're in, like, I had three lawyers, which is plenty of witnesses, in the meeting.
[02:52:35.252 --> 02:52:36.414]  They go, don't meet with that guy.
[02:52:36.434 --> 02:52:38.216]  You're being set up, blah, blah, blah.
[02:52:38.256 --> 02:52:41.038]  We've never seen this before, but this is the standard deal.
[02:52:41.659 --> 02:52:51.309]  And then he, in a secret filing, does it in March, and I learn about it, and I call him, and he calls me back, and I recorded that, and he says, I didn't file that.
[02:52:51.369 --> 02:52:51.750]  It's fake.
[02:52:52.418 --> 02:52:55.161]  The next week he testified in court that I was incompetent and should be fired.
[02:52:56.102 --> 02:53:01.449]  So, so this guy thinks I'm like a moron that can't read court filings and doesn't have counsel.
[02:53:01.989 --> 02:53:06.274]  So, this is, what was crazy is the ham-fistedness of it.
[02:53:07.863 --> 02:53:12.806]  And we have Harman as a witness as well, where Harman has been here 22 years, he's the sales manager.
[02:53:12.826 --> 02:53:18.130]  We're like, he's the sales manager, bring him over, either increase his salary or give him a percentage.
[02:53:18.170 --> 02:53:19.031]  That's how sales works.
[02:53:19.051 --> 02:53:22.273]  And they go, no, we're not going to pay ad agencies 10%, which is 30% for most people.
[02:53:22.293 --> 02:53:23.835]  I don't know how to really get them down.
[02:53:24.395 --> 02:53:25.716]  I'm kind of good at that.
[02:53:25.736 --> 02:53:27.037]  Like, no, we're not doing your deal.
[02:53:27.297 --> 02:53:27.958]  You get 10%.
[02:53:28.238 --> 02:53:28.798]  Standards 30.
[02:53:29.439 --> 02:53:30.760]  This guy, you're incompetent.
[02:53:30.820 --> 02:53:32.061]  We don't pay them anything.
[02:53:33.092 --> 02:53:34.793]  And I'm like, okay, what do you know?
[02:53:34.813 --> 02:53:37.616]  You used to like, put into bankruptcy Mexican food restaurants.
[02:53:38.256 --> 02:53:46.183]  And so, I'm sitting there, knowing I'm being set up, so I'm checking everything with lawyers, they go, let's go into the meeting, let's get it on record, boom, this guy's trying to set you up.
[02:53:46.463 --> 02:53:57.672]  So I go in, I'm sitting here, and he's doing this, and then he goes back and files it again and says, I want to take over free speech systems, I want to fire Alex Jones, this is three months ago,
[02:53:58.292 --> 02:54:05.443]  Let me ask you, Alex, just this guy is whom, not by name, but by phone, says his name is Pat McGill, Patrick McGill.
[02:54:06.685 --> 02:54:11.873]  So you only have a pool, a pool of bankruptcy accountants you can use.
[02:54:11.893 --> 02:54:12.334]  He's a CPA.
[02:54:14.036 --> 02:54:17.299]  And so no one would take the job and they go, oh, here's the guy.
[02:54:17.319 --> 02:54:19.260]  And I'm like, well, America's not that corrupt.
[02:54:19.280 --> 02:54:20.221]  This guy's not an operative.
[02:54:20.601 --> 02:54:23.684]  And then in my opinion, that's exactly what happened.
[02:54:23.704 --> 02:54:27.787]  So the point is, is my lawyers who are top shelf, but they know I'll say stuff.
[02:54:27.807 --> 02:54:30.409]  So don't tell me they go, do not ever be in a room alone with him.
[02:54:30.809 --> 02:54:31.630]  Watch your ass.
[02:54:31.990 --> 02:54:32.711]  Watch your shit.
[02:54:32.771 --> 02:54:36.974]  This is like when he came on, they go, oh my God, I said to my lawyers, we're not going to say anything.
[02:54:38.055 --> 02:54:40.696]  Just trust us, do never be in a room alone with him.
[02:54:40.716 --> 02:54:42.737]  They were like, fucking panicked.
[02:54:42.997 --> 02:54:45.038]  They were like, oh my god, I was like, what have I done?
[02:54:45.078 --> 02:54:46.159]  I'm like, Darth Vader in, okay?
[02:54:46.699 --> 02:54:47.940]  I'm like, I'm sorry, I didn't know.
[02:54:47.960 --> 02:54:49.580]  I was like, okay, just don't ever be with him alone.
[02:54:49.901 --> 02:55:00.586]  And then he runs around trying to say that I'm stealing money, and he's so lazy, we filed in the court that, hey, because John Harmon's great.
[02:55:01.326 --> 02:55:04.388]  But the main sponsors is coming with money, and then I do the work.
[02:55:04.468 --> 02:55:05.249]  I produce the ad.
[02:55:05.269 --> 02:55:06.169]  I actually do everything.
[02:55:06.670 --> 02:55:07.390]  I shoot the ad.
[02:55:07.830 --> 02:55:10.632]  But Harmon is there for anybody that has a talk show.
[02:55:10.652 --> 02:55:11.773]  I remember I made it a secret.
[02:55:12.173 --> 02:55:14.075]  Maybe one out of 20 guests has a book.
[02:55:14.135 --> 02:55:14.835]  We're already going to do it.
[02:55:14.855 --> 02:55:15.736]  They go, hey, we love you.
[02:55:16.016 --> 02:55:19.178]  If you plug it extra hard, we'll sign a contract, give you 5%.
[02:55:19.518 --> 02:55:23.461]  So Harmon's willing for like $5,000 or whatever the little book makes or whatever it is.
[02:55:23.881 --> 02:55:25.442]  He's been here 22 years.
[02:55:25.822 --> 02:55:28.204]  Board op, producer, phone screener.
[02:55:28.244 --> 02:55:28.764]  He's done it all.
[02:55:28.924 --> 02:55:30.746]  Great fucking amazing guy.
[02:55:31.886 --> 02:55:35.367]  I would give him the crumbs because he would do the work and give him like 5%.
[02:55:36.108 --> 02:55:37.428]  So he's been here decades doing this.
[02:55:37.948 --> 02:55:41.610]  So I'm like, hey, this guy's got $200,000 over here in the last couple of months, which sounds like a lot.
[02:55:41.630 --> 02:55:42.470]  To fund this is nothing.
[02:55:42.770 --> 02:55:46.951]  The main sponsorship was $12 million a year when he killed it all the year before he came in.
[02:55:47.312 --> 02:55:48.712]  He kills $12 million in advertising.
[02:55:48.732 --> 02:55:50.473]  It was actually more than that they were ready to do.
[02:55:50.493 --> 02:55:51.793]  $20-40 million.
[02:55:52.053 --> 02:55:58.916]  So he kills that and then says, but don't worry, I've killed all your major advertising that's direct paid to us by major companies.
[02:56:00.757 --> 02:56:02.198]  You and Harmon can just keep that money.
[02:56:02.718 --> 02:56:04.779]  And Harmon goes, hey, can I have my 5% now?
[02:56:04.879 --> 02:56:05.960]  And I go, no, John.
[02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:10.102]  My lawyers say we've got to go get a deal because we can't do that.
[02:56:10.222 --> 02:56:10.902]  It's in bankruptcy.
[02:56:10.922 --> 02:56:12.283]  We've got to give the money to free speech.
[02:56:12.543 --> 02:56:15.224]  Now he should sign you on as a sales manager and pay your 5%.
[02:56:15.664 --> 02:56:19.366]  And so we're in meeting after meeting with my lawyers.
[02:56:19.666 --> 02:56:21.127]  And my lawyers go, something's not right.
[02:56:21.167 --> 02:56:22.148]  We're going to follow the court.
[02:56:22.508 --> 02:56:24.349]  Two months, three months has gone on.
[02:56:24.689 --> 02:56:25.589]  He won't take the money.
[02:56:25.649 --> 02:56:26.610]  We think it's a setup.
[02:56:27.330 --> 02:56:39.179]  And then that's exactly what it was, and then he goes to the court and says, I caught him with money, even though I'm with three lawyers and a CPA with him, and he was too dumb to know we filed two months before he did it in the report.
[02:56:39.480 --> 02:56:46.205]  Then he does it again in March, six months later, and tells the court, I got to fire Alex Jones and take over.
[02:56:46.485 --> 02:56:47.186]  He's incompetent.
[02:56:47.206 --> 02:56:48.026]  I call him stealing money.
[02:56:48.787 --> 02:56:50.248]  I'm going to stop.
[02:56:50.308 --> 02:56:50.949]  I got to piss.
[02:56:50.989 --> 02:56:51.469]  I'm listening to you.
[02:56:51.489 --> 02:56:52.210]  You want to ask a question?
[02:56:52.230 --> 02:56:52.490]  Go ahead.
[02:56:53.314 --> 02:56:59.697]  Well, the question is going to be when you come back, what was the rationale, the justification for killing the 12 million in advertising revenue?
[02:56:59.717 --> 02:57:02.178]  But before you go, go, go do your business.
[02:57:02.638 --> 02:57:04.138]  Barnes is going to chime in right now.
[02:57:04.158 --> 02:57:04.819]  I'm listening.
[02:57:05.259 --> 02:57:06.079]  I'm listening.
[02:57:06.279 --> 02:57:06.499]  Go ahead.
[02:57:06.539 --> 02:57:07.099]  Don't worry.
[02:57:07.119 --> 02:57:07.380]  Go for it.
[02:57:07.400 --> 02:57:07.700]  Go for it.
[02:57:07.860 --> 02:57:09.901]  And I'll see which commercial free.
[02:57:09.961 --> 02:57:10.201]  So I
[02:57:11.741 --> 02:57:16.683]  Robert, rationalize, break down what Alex just said to the general public.
[02:57:17.023 --> 02:57:18.643]  Oh, it was supposed to be at the hour's end?
[02:57:18.943 --> 02:57:19.663]  Cut the break!
[02:57:20.024 --> 02:57:20.744]  Cut the break!
[02:57:21.104 --> 02:57:23.104]  Cut the break!
[02:57:23.705 --> 02:57:27.166]  This is the problem in the risks of the bankruptcy process.
[02:57:27.366 --> 02:57:29.246]  Like the bankruptcy under the U.S.
[02:57:29.306 --> 02:57:35.508]  Constitution, the power to regulate bankruptcy is given to Congress to pass certain laws.
[02:57:35.988 --> 02:57:48.763]  Congress has passed those laws to provide for bankruptcy being an option to resolve when your debts exceed your income stream over a certain time frame, whether you're an individual or a business.
[02:57:49.604 --> 02:57:55.551]  And what's supposed to happen once Alex Jones and Infowars filed for bankruptcy protection,
[02:57:56.423 --> 02:58:11.795]  Then the obligation of the bankruptcy court, the obligation in this case of the creditors, the obligation of the other officials associated or affiliated with the bankruptcy court or appointed by power of the bankruptcy court.
[02:58:12.676 --> 02:58:17.500]  All of those people have an ethical and professional and legal obligation.
[02:58:17.820 --> 02:58:22.644]  One could even argue constitutional obligation because of the origins of bankruptcy laws.
[02:58:23.334 --> 02:58:27.097]  To to maximize the value of the estate.
[02:58:28.218 --> 02:58:33.762]  And what in the case of Alex Jones and InfoWars is maximizing the value of the state.
[02:58:34.343 --> 02:58:38.246]  It's improving and increasing the reach of InfoWars.
[02:58:38.766 --> 02:58:42.809]  It's improving and increasing the reach of Alex Jones.
[02:58:43.490 --> 02:58:51.376]  And it is in particular protecting the biggest and best asset for either Alex Jones or InfoWars, which is Alex Jones.
[02:58:51.903 --> 02:58:53.344]  My name doesn't even come up.
[02:59:13.917 --> 02:59:25.684]  And now the problem is, the principal unsecured creditors, the plaintiff's lawyers, have never, in my opinion, cared about their own clients.
[02:59:25.904 --> 02:59:26.965]  But it's not your opinion.
[02:59:26.985 --> 02:59:27.865]  It's not your opinion.
[02:59:28.245 --> 02:59:32.348]  They said on the courthouse steps in Texas and Connecticut, we don't want money, we want to shut him down.
[02:59:33.228 --> 02:59:36.710]  Because the law says they've actually got to try to get money, they act like they do, but that's it.
[02:59:36.730 --> 02:59:37.491]  There's no settlement.
[02:59:38.686 --> 02:59:40.326]  That's their fiduciary obligation.
[02:59:40.346 --> 02:59:45.047]  That's their professional obligation to their client, is to maximize recovery for their client.
[02:59:45.407 --> 02:59:50.468]  But they've admitted in multiple public proceedings and public statements that that's not their goal.
[02:59:50.508 --> 03:00:03.011]  Their goal is to use these lawsuits to shut down Alex Jones, to shut down Infowars, to shut down the most important dissident opinion on the right concerning issues of the war in the surveillance state and the deep state.
[03:00:03.491 --> 03:00:04.812]  That's always been their objective.
[03:00:05.232 --> 03:00:12.077]  And they just use the families as cover, as a fig leaf for that politically motivated objective.
[03:00:12.538 --> 03:00:14.139]  The bankruptcy laws expose that.
[03:00:14.619 --> 03:00:24.086]  Because we got to witness over the last two years, what they fight to maximize value, which meant maximize the value of Alex Jones, maximize the value of InfoWars.
[03:00:24.766 --> 03:00:33.971]  Or would they instead use the bankruptcy proceedings to try to do what they were always about, shutting down and silencing Alex Jones?
[03:00:34.151 --> 03:00:43.075]  And because they couldn't find a crime, now they're just going to try to deep-six it and I thought they'd sneak in and just shut it down Friday.
[03:00:43.215 --> 03:00:44.936]  Why would they do this now, Robert?
[03:00:45.256 --> 03:00:46.197]  They seem really panicked.
[03:00:47.153 --> 03:00:48.394]  The timing is quite obvious.
[03:00:48.854 --> 03:00:57.581]  So, I mean, for those that don't understand the protocol, what happens is you basically have someone who controls the money, controls the bank accounts, that is a hybrid.
[03:00:57.841 --> 03:01:05.587]  There's someone that may be recommended by the debtor, but they have to be approved of effectively by the bankruptcy court and to some degree by the creditors.
[03:01:06.175 --> 03:01:07.896]  And so you have somebody who controls the money.
[03:01:08.156 --> 03:01:17.002]  And if his goal was to maximize the monetary value of Infowars and Alex Jones, he would have done things radically different over the last two years than what he's actually done.
[03:01:17.062 --> 03:01:18.122]  He cut everything off.
[03:01:18.183 --> 03:01:19.944]  I mean, we go on the road, we make tons of money.
[03:01:20.504 --> 03:01:21.525]  Everything was cut off.
[03:01:21.565 --> 03:01:23.146]  He just said, no, no to 12 million.
[03:01:23.606 --> 03:01:24.646]  Ad agencies are a fraud.
[03:01:24.666 --> 03:01:27.188]  And I said, ad agencies are accredited companies.
[03:01:27.548 --> 03:01:28.369]  These are billion dollar.
[03:01:28.789 --> 03:01:29.249]  No, we're not.
[03:01:29.770 --> 03:01:30.410]  It's all over.
[03:01:30.630 --> 03:01:31.751]  He just cut everything off.
[03:01:32.819 --> 03:01:55.831]  And he's using and weaponizing his access and control of the bank account to tell the security team, whose funds he controls, whose paychecks he controls, you're going to lock up and padlock InfoWars, and you're going to do it at my order, because I control whether or not you get paid or not, even though there's no court order that justifies it, even though it's directly contrary.
[03:01:55.851 --> 03:02:00.454]  So I was right to say you better check with the court, and then they actually checked with lawyers and said no.
[03:02:03.413 --> 03:02:07.117]  What he's doing violates his ethical and professional and legal obligations.
[03:02:07.778 --> 03:02:09.059]  Fiduciary obligations.
[03:02:09.079 --> 03:02:12.944]  He's going to shut down the money maker for them, admitting the whole thing.
[03:02:13.384 --> 03:02:17.569]  Did you say he's going to get rewarded on the back side, you presume?
[03:02:17.929 --> 03:02:23.355]  I mean, you know, you find out like this, how corruption works in this system, that what happens is they don't get
[03:02:24.055 --> 03:02:26.337]  They don't get their money up front.
[03:02:26.517 --> 03:02:27.618]  They get their money on the back side.
[03:02:27.878 --> 03:02:30.641]  In bankruptcy, sadly, I've dealt with it in multiple contexts.
[03:02:30.981 --> 03:02:40.809]  You'll have a trustee or someone put into a fiduciary role like this individual who will then undermine the estate and then six months, a year later, is employed.
[03:02:41.443 --> 03:02:46.287]  By certain creditors or connected parties who were enriched by that.
[03:02:46.587 --> 03:02:53.433]  And since that legal team is suing everybody and bringing them to bankruptcy, they could place him as a CRO and it could almost be like a little chain.
[03:02:53.773 --> 03:02:54.254]  Who knows?
[03:02:54.334 --> 03:03:00.559]  I mean, all I know is he's literally, I'm in meetings with my lawyers saying, we got this money, he won't take it, then turns around and says, I stole it.
[03:03:00.639 --> 03:03:05.643]  I mean, the laziness though, because my lawyers read all the filings by everybody.
[03:03:05.983 --> 03:03:08.766]  They didn't even know we'd filed in court and told the court about this money.
[03:03:09.778 --> 03:03:11.499]  And the judge flipped out on him at that point.
[03:03:11.900 --> 03:03:12.440]  Sorry.
[03:03:12.460 --> 03:03:19.045]  They get away with it so routinely and regularly that they don't think anyone will expose them, and then they think they'll get away with it even when they get exposed.
[03:03:19.265 --> 03:03:21.467]  But the timing is clearly connected.
[03:03:21.887 --> 03:03:28.072]  In part, it's connected to the upcoming dates that his ability to control things might be removed, that you may be restored.
[03:03:28.092 --> 03:03:28.593]  No, that's it.
[03:03:28.773 --> 03:03:34.237]  The judge said two weeks ago, I'm removing you and giving you back to Jones on the 14th, so then he just tries to shut it.
[03:03:35.185 --> 03:03:35.725]  That's correct.
[03:03:35.745 --> 03:03:39.368]  In order to get paid off by somebody, you presume, is what I would presume.
[03:03:39.548 --> 03:03:44.731]  Well, it's very interesting because, Alex, did you not say that this guy's getting paid $50,000 a month?
[03:03:45.051 --> 03:03:46.713]  Yeah, he's paid $50,000 a month.
[03:03:47.213 --> 03:03:49.554]  He's here like once a week, every two weeks.
[03:03:49.634 --> 03:03:50.995]  What did you say about every couple weeks he's here?
[03:03:52.196 --> 03:03:53.677]  I mean, in my opinion.
[03:03:53.737 --> 03:04:00.822]  Well, beyond that, you don't take, like, major known sponsors that are, like, oh, it's like four sponsors, 12 million a year.
[03:04:01.342 --> 03:04:06.566]  It was like, because that's pure money, because with the supplements, we only make like 30-40% as we discount it, and it's high quality.
[03:04:06.806 --> 03:04:09.128]  Water filters, we have such a good deal, we make like 35%.
[03:04:09.348 --> 03:04:10.869]  So 10% off, we're making like 25%.
[03:04:10.949 --> 03:04:15.532]  He literally, I'm like, why are you cutting off all our sponsors?
[03:04:15.552 --> 03:04:18.975]  He frickin' went... But you should get into online gambling.
[03:04:19.966 --> 03:04:22.310]  Well, he pinched me on online gambling.
[03:04:22.330 --> 03:04:25.455]  Yeah, well, it's probably pretty easy to launder money if you're operating a gambling.
[03:04:25.976 --> 03:04:28.359]  I don't know what he was doing, but I said I'm not pitching gambling.
[03:04:29.102 --> 03:04:33.144]  Hold on, I think I can add Chase by way of... No, that's the wrong way.
[03:04:33.184 --> 03:04:34.064]  That's my ugly face here.
[03:04:34.084 --> 03:04:36.465]  You've been trying to talk and Barnes is knocking it out of the park.
[03:04:36.825 --> 03:04:46.869]  I'm just telling you, we've been here, we've seen this, Barnes crawled through my books, all my lawyers that have been here, he represented me for years, have seen this and they're so pissed that I'm a Boy Scout.
[03:04:47.170 --> 03:04:49.851]  Because quite frankly guys, I ain't sitting there watching my bank account.
[03:04:50.171 --> 03:04:52.532]  I got CPAs, I got companies that handle that.
[03:04:53.192 --> 03:04:58.878]  And Alex, what you I think you might have answered my question because I'm thinking I'm sitting here yesterday.
[03:04:58.978 --> 03:05:00.920]  I'm at I'm in Orlando with Barnes.
[03:05:00.960 --> 03:05:03.963]  I go to a pool with my kid and like fifty thousand bucks a month.
[03:05:04.203 --> 03:05:07.046]  Why would the guy try to torpedo his own honey?
[03:05:07.206 --> 03:05:07.767]  What is it called?
[03:05:07.787 --> 03:05:08.788]  His own golden goose.
[03:05:09.268 --> 03:05:13.232]  If it turns out that as of the 14th, he risks not getting his 50 G's a month.
[03:05:13.572 --> 03:05:14.053]  If that's what I've
[03:05:17.836 --> 03:05:21.377]  He's prepared to torpedo this in the absence of a lawful order.
[03:05:21.678 --> 03:05:23.558]  Yeah, because he's about to lose control.
[03:05:23.598 --> 03:05:27.619]  No, the judge said two weeks ago, I'm giving the company back to Alex Jones.
[03:05:28.300 --> 03:05:31.321]  The creditors are not acting in good faith.
[03:05:31.341 --> 03:05:32.901]  He said this.
[03:05:33.001 --> 03:05:34.002]  It was a huge announcement.
[03:05:34.022 --> 03:05:35.702]  The creditors are not acting in good faith.
[03:05:35.742 --> 03:05:37.143]  Yeah, they don't want money.
[03:05:37.363 --> 03:05:40.824]  And so then they flip out and say, shut the son of a bitch down.
[03:05:41.926 --> 03:05:43.007]  Well, that's always been their goal.
[03:05:43.287 --> 03:05:51.336]  I mean, the fact that they've, in my view, the plaintiff's lawyers have violated their fiduciary obligations and committed legal malpractice towards their clients.
[03:05:51.376 --> 03:05:55.500]  By the way, you saying this a year ago caused a whole firestorm I later learned was in them.
[03:05:55.841 --> 03:05:56.942]  Start over, Barrett, start over.
[03:05:57.122 --> 03:06:08.088]  I was going to say, Robert has said this at least over a year and a half ago, because I remember the day he said it, and I was like, well, I mean, they've tried to weaponize the bankruptcy process to come after me.
[03:06:08.448 --> 03:06:10.149]  So that's how nuts these people are.
[03:06:10.989 --> 03:06:12.310]  Because their goal is political.
[03:06:12.350 --> 03:06:13.811]  Their goal is to use their clients.
[03:06:13.831 --> 03:06:15.251]  By the way, that's off record.
[03:06:15.291 --> 03:06:16.792]  So if you want me to say it, I'll say it, Barnes.
[03:06:17.353 --> 03:06:21.655]  Part of their settlement was me, was to let them sue you for malpractice.
[03:06:21.695 --> 03:06:22.795]  And of course, I said, fuck you.
[03:06:24.437 --> 03:06:26.060]  Yeah, well, and they've been obsessed.
[03:06:26.541 --> 03:06:34.658]  The goal has been to weaponize this process to go after the people they consider political adversaries and effective... And they think I'm like them, like, I've been friends with you for...
[03:06:35.732 --> 03:06:36.292]  Six years.
[03:06:36.372 --> 03:06:37.333]  I think you're a great guy.
[03:06:37.633 --> 03:06:38.934]  I don't throw my friends away.
[03:06:38.954 --> 03:06:40.915]  They're like, hey, we'll settle if you just throw them.
[03:06:40.935 --> 03:06:42.696]  They really don't.
[03:06:42.716 --> 03:06:45.638]  They won Barnes.
[03:06:45.658 --> 03:06:47.519]  They got to get into a little bit of a long line for that.
[03:06:47.539 --> 03:06:50.201]  There's a lot of some other people that are in the front.
[03:06:50.521 --> 03:06:52.502]  But that's the nature of what's taking place here.
[03:06:52.642 --> 03:06:56.064]  And I think the timing, the second aspect of the timing is not coincidental.
[03:06:56.705 --> 03:07:03.489]  I mean, I think he's been escalating this plan, this accelerating this plan for the purpose of taking off in fours right on the eve of the election.
[03:07:04.290 --> 03:07:08.113]  I mean, it's right after Trump gets bogus indicted, the whole goal, and bogus convicted.
[03:07:08.293 --> 03:07:09.995]  And by the way, the whole public gets that.
[03:07:10.015 --> 03:07:16.140]  And I think the earlier guest said that, Steve, both, both Jack Posobiec and Steve Quayle.
[03:07:17.603 --> 03:07:20.885]  I don't think they tried to use the cover of Trump indictment to do this.
[03:07:21.285 --> 03:07:23.046]  I think it's desperation.
[03:07:23.346 --> 03:07:31.009]  And so they're just like... They need people to believe the fake news that that verdict is an honest verdict of an honest jury of an honest trial.
[03:07:31.410 --> 03:07:36.152]  Because their whole goal has been to use that case to destroy... I just can't believe I discovered it.
[03:07:36.832 --> 03:07:39.473]  And literally thought, why is the security guy acting creepy?
[03:07:39.513 --> 03:07:41.373]  I've known him for a year, like, looking conflicted.
[03:07:41.673 --> 03:07:42.294]  And it just came to me.
[03:07:42.414 --> 03:07:43.254]  They're shutting it down tonight.
[03:07:43.654 --> 03:07:45.775]  And then I bluff them and say, so they're shutting it down.
[03:07:45.795 --> 03:07:47.215]  He goes, yeah, they're bringing in more people.
[03:07:47.235 --> 03:07:47.495]  I don't know.
[03:07:47.535 --> 03:07:48.155]  What do you know?
[03:07:48.195 --> 03:07:50.356]  I've only been told we may change the locks tonight.
[03:07:50.616 --> 03:07:51.996]  And then I made calls and found out.
[03:07:52.237 --> 03:07:53.437]  And they were like, how do you know this?
[03:07:53.457 --> 03:07:54.657]  They think I'm the CIA.
[03:07:54.717 --> 03:07:55.117]  No, man.
[03:07:55.517 --> 03:07:56.458]  I've got the Holy Spirit.
[03:07:56.478 --> 03:07:58.478]  But this literally happened Friday night.
[03:07:58.818 --> 03:07:59.399]  I slept here.
[03:07:59.639 --> 03:08:00.459]  I slept here last night.
[03:08:01.769 --> 03:08:08.735]  Yeah, and it's the nature of what, I mean the system keeps escalating and the question is where they go next if this doesn't work.
[03:08:08.915 --> 03:08:11.198]  Well I'm scared to ask you, what are they going to do next?
[03:08:12.335 --> 03:08:22.504]  I mean, that's well, we obviously have to pay attention to their efforts to escalate global conflict in terms of trying to provoke Russia into attacking Europe so they can create World War Three.
[03:08:23.385 --> 03:08:30.811]  We have to worry about this bird flu nonsense that they're trying to use to not only retake over our last aspects of organic original food supply.
[03:08:31.232 --> 03:08:35.656]  I mean, how is it that the bird flu suddenly shows up and supposedly only travels through raw milk?
[03:08:36.116 --> 03:08:43.282]  I want to speak to that, but everybody wants to know what's happening to us, and I'm a little selfish here, and I really respect you and Viva.
[03:08:43.682 --> 03:08:45.764]  So Viva has a talk show at Barnes, and then Viva.
[03:08:46.385 --> 03:08:47.386]  What is your advice to me?
[03:08:47.426 --> 03:08:48.927]  Because I only have people on that are right.
[03:08:49.227 --> 03:08:53.791]  So I have a lot of guests on a few times, and if they're right 80% of the time, they're on like once a year.
[03:08:53.811 --> 03:08:55.753]  If they're right 100% of the time, they're on every day.
[03:08:55.953 --> 03:08:56.793]  And I've been begging to come on.
[03:08:56.994 --> 03:08:58.855]  So you've been right about 100% of the time.
[03:08:59.175 --> 03:09:01.718]  So please tell me what's going to happen next, Barnes.
[03:09:03.634 --> 03:09:05.056]  I mean, hopefully it doesn't.
[03:09:05.416 --> 03:09:06.498]  I mean, what's going to happen next?
[03:09:06.818 --> 03:09:07.599]  Give me the bad news.
[03:09:07.659 --> 03:09:08.159]  I can take it.
[03:09:08.199 --> 03:09:11.203]  Well, look, I think they always misread you.
[03:09:11.243 --> 03:09:13.385]  And so all efforts to shut you down are not going to work.
[03:09:13.726 --> 03:09:18.691]  So even if they physically lock certain doors of certain buildings, it's not going to lock up your voice.
[03:09:19.172 --> 03:09:21.234]  And you were never driven by money.
[03:09:21.654 --> 03:09:25.238]  Uh, you were never driven by, uh, favorable, uh, impressions of somebody.
[03:09:25.278 --> 03:09:26.219]  Never driven by power.
[03:09:26.519 --> 03:09:27.581]  They never understood that.
[03:09:27.661 --> 03:09:30.023]  That Homeland caricature proved they didn't understand that.
[03:09:30.343 --> 03:09:31.365]  And they're going to continue to do that.
[03:09:31.385 --> 03:09:41.075]  Well, they admitted the CIA was so upset to destroy the populist archetype, they admittedly produced all these shows and movies about me to hurt me, as if, if they got me, they got everybody.
[03:09:41.095 --> 03:09:41.936]  It's ridiculous.
[03:09:42.881 --> 03:09:44.021]  Well, it was like the show trials.
[03:09:44.041 --> 03:09:49.784]  They really thought the show trials that they tested out, the ones that just got used against Trump, were tested out against you.
[03:09:50.264 --> 03:09:55.006]  And they thought it would work against you in the court of public opinion, and it backfired against them, like it's going to backfire.
[03:09:55.106 --> 03:09:59.207]  By the way, all choreographed by HBO with the same scripts, powder puffs.
[03:09:59.787 --> 03:10:00.608]  It was a movie set.
[03:10:00.788 --> 03:10:00.988]  Yeah.
[03:10:01.188 --> 03:10:04.889]  I tell you what, the one good thing about that documentary, though, wasn't it made by the same guy who made the Auntie Michael Jackson?
[03:10:04.909 --> 03:10:05.470]  I haven't watched it.
[03:10:05.490 --> 03:10:06.350]  I can't handle it.
[03:10:06.510 --> 03:10:11.432]  Well, it makes me think Michael Jackson's probably innocent, because the one about you was definitely off the mark.
[03:10:13.024 --> 03:10:16.845]  Well, it is stuff like, in interviews, it is stuff like, I deposed my dad eight times.
[03:10:17.305 --> 03:10:19.025]  My dad has nothing to do with this company.
[03:10:19.985 --> 03:10:21.986]  He used to do FDA stuff, he's a doctor.
[03:10:22.306 --> 03:10:26.427]  I had him make sure all we had, the approvals and the supplements were highest quality.
[03:10:26.747 --> 03:10:28.187]  My dad has nothing to do with this.
[03:10:28.947 --> 03:10:32.088]  And they literally have my dad in HBO, I haven't seen it, but I've seen a short clip.
[03:10:32.428 --> 03:10:33.368]  My mother is upset about it.
[03:10:33.708 --> 03:10:36.449]  That's, like, he knows what's, it's just pure horse shit.
[03:10:36.469 --> 03:10:37.109]  Sorry, go ahead, guys.
[03:10:37.591 --> 03:10:39.752]  Well, in fact, that's the reason why they had to rig your trial.
[03:10:39.832 --> 03:10:41.212]  I mean, it was literally a show trial.
[03:10:41.512 --> 03:10:54.957]  They got upset that I talked about it at the time on InfoWars, which was that, in other words, in order for them to get away with libel, they need to make sure that you couldn't present a defense in the courtroom, because then they could say, oh, we're just broadcasting what happened in the courtroom.
[03:10:55.297 --> 03:10:59.179]  And for those that don't know, there are literally HBO movie cameras all around the courtroom.
[03:10:59.399 --> 03:11:04.661]  I mean... No, no, I was there by both judges and I looked and I was like, I didn't know they were in Connecticut.
[03:11:04.881 --> 03:11:10.403]  There was a second trial and I went, wait a minute, I've seen that exact font, that exact... Holy shit, there's a script on her desk.
[03:11:12.662 --> 03:11:13.943]  And that's the nature of it.
[03:11:14.063 --> 03:11:16.704]  But in order for that to work, they need for it.
[03:11:16.944 --> 03:11:21.047]  They can excuse not covering your side of the equation if your side is not allowed.
[03:11:21.067 --> 03:11:23.628]  Well, people ask why I got so freaked out at one point, have this really crazy look.
[03:11:24.009 --> 03:11:24.789]  I have a good memory.
[03:11:24.989 --> 03:11:25.830]  It used to be photographic.
[03:11:25.850 --> 03:11:27.010]  It's not now, but it's still really good.
[03:11:27.451 --> 03:11:30.312]  And I'm looking over at Barbara Bellis.
[03:11:31.273 --> 03:11:34.395]  And you got Judge Greg Gamble in Texas, but I've seen it like a month before.
[03:11:34.815 --> 03:11:37.997]  And I'm looking while she's babbling, like talking to lawyers.
[03:11:38.277 --> 03:11:38.817]  She's right here.
[03:11:38.837 --> 03:11:39.958]  And I'm going, wait a minute.
[03:11:40.498 --> 03:11:42.419]  Those talking points, that's the exact list.
[03:11:43.199 --> 03:11:45.280]  I was like, oh my god.
[03:11:45.400 --> 03:11:46.501]  I was like, wow.
[03:11:46.701 --> 03:11:49.703]  Barbara Bellis, for those who don't know, is the Connecticut judge.
[03:11:50.383 --> 03:11:53.344]  But Alex, what are they going to do next?
[03:11:53.364 --> 03:12:02.269]  The one level or the 2D level chess is they're going to use your case as an excuse to go after Rumble and other platforms.
[03:12:03.476 --> 03:12:07.519]  Well, you issued the false flag warning a little while ago.
[03:12:07.879 --> 03:12:12.802]  And I said, OK, they might try to go after Trump because what's the next Rubicon after everything they've done?
[03:12:12.822 --> 03:12:20.506]  I think the flip side is if they do something bad or violent to Trump, it will garner public support, sympathy and outrage.
[03:12:20.947 --> 03:12:24.849]  And so, Alex, you said I'm listening to your book, The Great Awakening, while I'm jogging.
[03:12:25.660 --> 03:12:29.565]  They're going to try to weaponize that, but not in a way that profits their adversaries.
[03:12:29.926 --> 03:12:32.609]  How do you get rage, sympathy, and, um...
[03:12:34.145 --> 03:12:35.746]  How do you get that for your own candidate?
[03:12:36.346 --> 03:12:40.227]  My fear is that they're going to stay, you know, they'll use all of this as a pretext.
[03:12:40.587 --> 03:12:41.768]  We went after Alex Jones.
[03:12:42.048 --> 03:12:42.968]  We went after Trump.
[03:12:43.528 --> 03:12:45.949]  And now something bad happened to Biden.
[03:12:46.429 --> 03:12:49.610]  And in so doing, they get to eliminate a number of... Well, that's what Biden said.
[03:12:49.650 --> 03:12:55.872]  He said Trump questioning his conviction is terrorism and Google is censoring all Trump donation pages.
[03:12:56.172 --> 03:12:57.593]  That's pure election meddling.
[03:12:58.308 --> 03:13:04.631]  Well, not just that, but everybody knows that Biden is a liability, not an asset for the Democrats and for the next election.
[03:13:05.071 --> 03:13:06.832]  But you can't just ask him to leave.
[03:13:06.872 --> 03:13:09.334]  You can't just remove him without political blowback.
[03:13:09.874 --> 03:13:13.896]  If you were to remove or eliminate Trump, there would be political blowback.
[03:13:13.936 --> 03:13:23.861]  And you'd also have a viable candidate in his son, Don Jr., and not to pick one over the other, but you'd have a viable replacement, outrage, sympathy, and political madness.
[03:13:24.855 --> 03:13:39.803]  What they're going to try to do, not a stage, an act of violence, I think they're genuinely going to try to eliminate Biden and then frame it as a response to the Trump verdict and this attack on you.
[03:13:40.164 --> 03:13:42.585]  And they'll say, I think it'll be deep state-ish.
[03:13:42.805 --> 03:13:44.026]  And they'll say, look what happened.
[03:13:44.386 --> 03:13:46.167]  We enact justice on Trump.
[03:13:46.347 --> 03:13:47.568]  We enact justice on Jones.
[03:13:47.788 --> 03:13:50.930]  And then these animals come after Biden.
[03:13:51.630 --> 03:14:04.764]  And then whoever replaces Biden gets the sympathy vote, gets the outrage vote, and they eliminate the liability, put in someone who would otherwise be unelectable due to unpopularity, and say, this is what we have to do now because they are such rabid animals.
[03:14:05.325 --> 03:14:08.969]  The bottom line, though, Alex, is don't do anything stupid.
[03:14:09.895 --> 03:14:11.796]  But, take it to court and see what happens.
[03:14:11.876 --> 03:14:13.137]  I don't know what's going to happen on June 14th.
[03:14:13.157 --> 03:14:16.719]  Like, what's the hearing that's scheduled for the 14th intended to resolve?
[03:14:16.959 --> 03:14:23.963]  Uh, the judge said that they're not settling, and he's excoriated them, and he said, this guy has never made this much money or asked me before.
[03:14:23.983 --> 03:14:24.983]  You guys need to go to mediation.
[03:14:25.003 --> 03:14:25.524]  He ordered it.
[03:14:26.429 --> 03:14:40.401]  And he's been a fair judge, and so he's going to either kick it back, he said, I will dismiss it and give it to Jones on the 14th, and then the state courts flood in to attack us, but for a while, I'll be back in charge, and we can fight that for a while.
[03:14:40.922 --> 03:14:45.886]  And so because that happened, then the next move was, okay, just use the CRO, shut it down.
[03:14:46.690 --> 03:14:52.372]  Okay, but so, give it back to Jones on the 14th means no longer trustee tutorship or curatorship, whatever.
[03:14:52.412 --> 03:14:56.794]  No, Alex Jones is the sole member of the LLC Free Speech Systems, is in charge.
[03:14:57.535 --> 03:15:03.737]  And so, I'm not a lawyer, but I told my crew, I told my lawyers, I said, you know, they want to shut this down.
[03:15:03.757 --> 03:15:04.978]  I think this guy's an operative.
[03:15:05.558 --> 03:15:09.540]  And I say that, you know, quote, I think it's, I believe it's my opinion.
[03:15:09.740 --> 03:15:11.221]  Yeah, like I believe the sun came up this morning.
[03:15:12.301 --> 03:15:13.722]  And so, and so,
[03:15:14.878 --> 03:15:15.879]  And they're like, yeah, you're right.
[03:15:16.379 --> 03:15:17.801]  They're all like, they're all blown away.
[03:15:17.821 --> 03:15:18.642]  I keep predicting it all.
[03:15:18.902 --> 03:15:20.343]  This is an obvious move.
[03:15:20.583 --> 03:15:22.405]  The judge says, I'm not destroying him for worse.
[03:15:22.685 --> 03:15:23.746]  You do it in the state courts.
[03:15:23.806 --> 03:15:27.009]  He kind of passes the ball, hands it back to us.
[03:15:27.190 --> 03:15:28.911]  And then now they just go, we'll just close the doors.
[03:15:28.951 --> 03:15:29.852]  And that's what happened.
[03:15:30.112 --> 03:15:35.477]  So I need to be better because I get into all the little factoids and I'm obnoxious about it because that's how my brain works.
[03:15:35.497 --> 03:15:36.578]  My brain's thinking about it.
[03:15:36.598 --> 03:15:37.639]  So I just say what I'm thinking.
[03:15:38.200 --> 03:15:39.822]  I'm not totally sure, but it's very simple.
[03:15:40.363 --> 03:15:46.009]  The Judge Lopez, who's known as a very fair scholarly judge, said, I'm not shutting it down.
[03:15:46.510 --> 03:15:47.872]  You don't have a real plan to McGill.
[03:15:47.932 --> 03:15:49.033]  You're not going to continue on.
[03:15:49.073 --> 03:15:50.595]  I'm giving it back to Alex Jones the 14th.
[03:15:51.035 --> 03:15:54.359]  And then a week later, we can have later, he says I'm shutting the doors.
[03:15:54.460 --> 03:15:56.242]  It's very obvious that.
[03:15:57.583 --> 03:16:00.044]  Yeah, well, as in shutting, I'm not shutting it down.
[03:16:00.084 --> 03:16:04.646]  We're going to give the company operation back to Alex Jones because he is the company behind it.
[03:16:04.746 --> 03:16:10.409]  They'll make the money and you'll exact your 1.5 billion dollar judgment if and when whatever happens.
[03:16:10.429 --> 03:16:12.370]  Yeah, the judge said, hey, I'm done.
[03:16:12.450 --> 03:16:13.310]  You're not in good faith.
[03:16:13.670 --> 03:16:14.530]  Jones gets it back.
[03:16:14.590 --> 03:16:15.311]  You deal with him.
[03:16:15.731 --> 03:16:17.212]  And then, yeah, and then this happens.
[03:16:18.172 --> 03:16:19.453]  Barnes, that's wild.
[03:16:19.513 --> 03:16:20.973]  I mean, now I'm understanding it.
[03:16:21.073 --> 03:16:22.434]  It's even more wild than I thought it was.
[03:16:23.038 --> 03:16:28.681]  Yeah, well, it's sadly what Alex and I discussed all the way back at the beginning of this.
[03:16:28.761 --> 03:16:32.142]  Yeah, five years ago he said, you can fight this, you can do whatever you want.
[03:16:33.463 --> 03:16:34.344]  It's attorney-client privilege.
[03:16:34.364 --> 03:16:35.264]  Can I say what you told me about?
[03:16:35.364 --> 03:16:36.405]  Oh yeah, go ahead.
[03:16:37.125 --> 03:16:39.566]  Barnes said, best move is you just leave the country now.
[03:16:39.846 --> 03:16:40.467]  It's all rigged.
[03:16:40.587 --> 03:16:41.907]  Nothing you do is going to stop anything.
[03:16:42.247 --> 03:16:44.549]  All you can hope is the Supreme Court just be straight on the merits.
[03:16:44.869 --> 03:16:46.730]  You've got a 10% chance they're going to take it on that.
[03:16:47.210 --> 03:16:48.711]  And this is a deep state operation.
[03:16:48.731 --> 03:16:49.291]  You should just leave.
[03:16:50.778 --> 03:16:51.738]  May I interject?
[03:16:51.899 --> 03:16:59.061]  And then they said to you, Alex, and we'll let you off more softly if you allow us to go prosecute your attorney for malpractice.
[03:16:59.201 --> 03:16:59.921]  I never knew that.
[03:17:00.282 --> 03:17:03.223]  And when I said, holy fuck, over on Rumble, it's because I never knew that.
[03:17:03.303 --> 03:17:03.923]  That's what happened?
[03:17:05.644 --> 03:17:08.605]  I was covering, I was following you, but I missed the point.
[03:17:08.645 --> 03:17:09.625]  Go ahead.
[03:17:09.685 --> 03:17:17.028]  That they said at some point, it will be easier on you if you throw your attorney Barnes under the bus for malpractice, and you said, go fuck yourselves.
[03:17:17.068 --> 03:17:18.168]  And I never knew any of this.
[03:17:18.348 --> 03:17:18.688]  Yeah, I know.
[03:17:18.728 --> 03:17:19.269]  The plaintiffs...
[03:17:20.849 --> 03:17:21.570]  Repeatedly.
[03:17:22.630 --> 03:17:23.991]  We're like, we want Barnes.
[03:17:24.432 --> 03:17:25.332]  He did all this.
[03:17:25.412 --> 03:17:26.533]  He's the reason you're in trouble.
[03:17:26.593 --> 03:17:27.534]  And I'm like, no, you did this.
[03:17:27.574 --> 03:17:28.254]  It was all rigged.
[03:17:28.714 --> 03:17:37.960]  And then it was repeatedly brought up in the negotiations that if you get the first thing was, well, the first thing was come out against the Second Amendment.
[03:17:38.401 --> 03:17:40.362]  And I said to my lawyer, this is a list of stuff they want.
[03:17:40.382 --> 03:17:41.342]  They want me to be under control.
[03:17:41.543 --> 03:17:42.223]  I said, go ahead and ask.
[03:17:42.443 --> 03:17:43.904]  It was like, well, we want to meet with you then.
[03:17:44.024 --> 03:17:45.165]  And I was like, no, doing none of it.
[03:17:45.505 --> 03:17:46.206]  And the next thing was,
[03:17:47.446 --> 03:17:49.948]  We want you to sue Robert Barnes.
[03:17:50.388 --> 03:17:59.913]  We want you to give us the contract on him and say that you agree for us in your stead to sue Robert Barnes.
[03:17:59.933 --> 03:18:04.576]  The whole nature has been to first silence Alex Jones at Infowars.
[03:18:04.776 --> 03:18:07.317]  And then scare any lawyer that represents somebody properly.
[03:18:08.198 --> 03:18:10.479]  Just like the jailing of Trump lawyers.
[03:18:11.380 --> 03:18:11.920]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:18:13.381 --> 03:18:22.067]  We kept saying at the time, everything vis-a-vis big tech censorship, everything vis-a-vis lawfare, was going to be tested out on Alex Jones first.
[03:18:22.607 --> 03:18:32.394]  And if they got away with it with you, they were then going to use it on Trump, like they've used it on Trump throughout the civil and criminal cases, like they've used it on Trump's lawyers.
[03:18:32.594 --> 03:18:38.998]  I mean, we have a professor, one of the most well-regarded, well-respected constitutional law professors in America, like Eastman,
[03:18:39.378 --> 03:18:42.639]  Listen, I was out in the hallway in the Texas case.
[03:19:02.563 --> 03:19:09.846]  And I'm walking in with the security guys, and the other lawyers start laughing, and they're like, you and Barnes, we're gonna get that Barnes.
[03:19:09.886 --> 03:19:11.147]  They really don't like you.
[03:19:11.167 --> 03:19:12.467]  So why is that, Robert?
[03:19:12.487 --> 03:19:14.789]  Yeah, well, that's why I got the Bobby nickname.
[03:19:15.049 --> 03:19:16.809]  Well, they don't want any effective advocates.
[03:19:16.970 --> 03:19:19.331]  Yeah, they go, we're gonna get Bobby B. I told you.
[03:19:19.591 --> 03:19:24.193]  They go, you and your little buddy, we're gonna get Bobby B. Tell Bobby B we said hi.
[03:19:25.137 --> 03:19:27.998]  And I was like... Holy shit!
[03:19:28.298 --> 03:19:30.039]  Well, Robert, am I in trouble?
[03:19:30.059 --> 03:19:32.080]  Because I just want to avoid some trouble, people.
[03:19:32.100 --> 03:19:33.741]  I'm just going to go back out into the corner.
[03:19:35.982 --> 03:19:37.562]  There was a lot of confession through projection.
[03:19:37.642 --> 03:19:44.645]  What was fascinating is what Alex and I talked about in the very beginning, that they had this caricature of him that they didn't understand, just like with Trump.
[03:19:44.805 --> 03:19:48.887]  They had this caricature of Trump that most people would fold and capitulate
[03:19:49.367 --> 03:19:51.710]  In Alex's position under the pressure he's been under.
[03:19:52.090 --> 03:19:56.135]  Most people in politics would fold and capitulate under the pressure.
[03:19:56.175 --> 03:19:56.495]  That's right.
[03:19:56.516 --> 03:19:57.196]  I want to be clear.
[03:19:57.216 --> 03:19:58.738]  I don't know how to fold.
[03:19:58.758 --> 03:20:01.701]  It's like, it's not that I don't fold.
[03:20:01.721 --> 03:20:02.663]  I don't know how.
[03:20:04.274 --> 03:20:11.380]  It's because they don't understand you, they don't understand Alex Jones, they don't understand Donald Trump, and they don't understand the American people.
[03:20:11.580 --> 03:20:15.383]  They don't understand the backbone of the American people, the common sense of the American people.
[03:20:15.403 --> 03:20:19.627]  They thought if they went after all this lawfare that Alex Jones and InfoWare would shut down on its own accord.
[03:20:20.231 --> 03:20:26.015]  I mean, what they called for at the end of the Connecticut verdict was, hey, InfoWars audience, quit supporting Alex Jones.
[03:20:26.335 --> 03:20:27.436]  Quit supporting InfoWars.
[03:20:27.496 --> 03:20:28.076]  Abandon him.
[03:20:28.737 --> 03:20:30.378]  And then everything might be okay.
[03:20:30.578 --> 03:20:31.398]  And it didn't happen.
[03:20:31.819 --> 03:20:32.639]  And the same with Trump.
[03:20:32.699 --> 03:20:37.202]  They keep expecting, hey, we'll do this lawfare and that lawfare and this other lawfare.
[03:20:37.442 --> 03:20:38.523]  We'll try to bankrupt him.
[03:20:38.563 --> 03:20:40.905]  We'll falsely accuse him of sexual assault.
[03:20:41.305 --> 03:20:50.915]  Well here's the thing about a fight, when you're just sitting there for no reason, and somebody comes and punches you in the head, at least if you're me or people I've been around, like, you're not dealing with any thought now.
[03:20:50.975 --> 03:20:51.675]  You're in a war.
[03:20:52.216 --> 03:20:55.059]  And they don't get, like, the more they punch me, the meaner I get.
[03:20:55.319 --> 03:20:55.960]  It's like, you know.
[03:20:56.977 --> 03:21:02.299]  Well, I think somebody compared it to your situation and Trump's situation to the old Godzilla.
[03:21:02.779 --> 03:21:05.060]  The more you nuke them, the stronger they get.
[03:21:05.580 --> 03:21:07.361]  And that's going to continue to be the case.
[03:21:07.821 --> 03:21:09.762]  And that's what they don't understand.
[03:21:09.982 --> 03:21:17.445]  The great saving grace of the American people and the American Constitutional Republic is the American people.
[03:21:18.027 --> 03:21:29.870]  Uh, is that they are seeing through this lawfare against Alex Jones and InfoWars, seeing through this lawfare against President Trump, seeing through this lawfare against Julian Assange and Ed Snowden and the January 6th defendants.
[03:21:30.471 --> 03:21:38.673]  And it's the legal system that must come- And that's what scares me, because lawyers are good when you need them, and there's some great lawyers, but 90% of us are either dumb or evil.
[03:21:39.413 --> 03:21:43.654]  And it's just, you know, it's like this infestation, but you gotta have one to counter it, so it's this paradox.
[03:21:45.715 --> 03:21:52.901]  All the mainline military analysts in the Pentagon, even though a bunch of leaders are bad, they're like, you gotta stop, it's nuclear war.
[03:21:53.261 --> 03:22:01.327]  But it's now a bunch of weird lawyers, like Obama and inbred Rothschilds are like, no, a nuclear war, let's have one.
[03:22:01.728 --> 03:22:06.111]  Like, that is crazy that lawyers now think they know about nuclear war.
[03:22:06.712 --> 03:22:13.377]  Well, in fairness, an article in the Huffington Post said a small nuclear war could be good for the environment, so... The Sean Penn said that!
[03:22:14.858 --> 03:22:17.059]  Well, we've talked about this.
[03:22:17.220 --> 03:22:21.883]  It's very much pre-World War I. So, I mean, that's probably the script to pay attention to.
[03:22:21.983 --> 03:22:24.484]  You know, the banking elites were making horrific decisions.
[03:22:24.565 --> 03:22:27.146]  The political elites were making horrific decisions.
[03:22:27.486 --> 03:22:32.130]  And World War I birthed the Great Depression and brought fascism, communism, and then World War II.
[03:22:32.730 --> 03:22:36.833]  But we have people that have the moral broken compass of Kissinger.
[03:22:38.274 --> 03:22:42.000]  Exactly!
[03:22:42.460 --> 03:22:46.606]  He had probably 170 IQ and was a sociopath.
[03:22:46.866 --> 03:22:50.791]  They have 90 IQ and are sociopaths in control of nuclear weapons.
[03:22:50.932 --> 03:22:52.374]  They're the biggest danger to themselves.
[03:22:53.260 --> 03:22:53.901]  That's what I described.
[03:22:53.961 --> 03:22:56.724]  I mean, Joe Biden, he's LBJ, but retarded.
[03:22:57.965 --> 03:23:00.968]  And if you combine those two, you really get a predictable.
[03:23:01.349 --> 03:23:06.955]  So you have these ethically compromised legal actors and political actors.
[03:23:07.015 --> 03:23:09.337]  And by the way, people project all this power on the government.
[03:23:10.078 --> 03:23:10.759]  It's not come out.
[03:23:12.060 --> 03:23:13.161]  They had 60-minute shows about it.
[03:23:13.562 --> 03:23:14.523]  They were so mad.
[03:23:14.563 --> 03:23:19.208]  I was sending memos to Trump saying, hey, Fiona Hill and this guy and this guy are all Soros on the board.
[03:23:19.508 --> 03:23:23.932]  He'd fire them, and they'd flip out and do 60 minutes about, I don't know George Soros.
[03:23:24.032 --> 03:23:24.753]  I love everybody.
[03:23:24.813 --> 03:23:25.514]  I'm a right winger.
[03:23:25.914 --> 03:23:29.718]  You know, it was like, I realized the political class is so dumb.
[03:23:30.279 --> 03:23:33.062]  Like, none of the Trump people were, like, Googling who was in the White House.
[03:23:34.011 --> 03:23:35.411]  So we want to say Trump's that strong.
[03:23:35.451 --> 03:23:39.813]  He's got an impetus to rebuild and turn on energy and bring jobs back and make better deals.
[03:23:40.393 --> 03:23:49.656]  So I want to say Trump's dumb, he's very smart in ways, but he's very blind because all he's been doing for 78 years is business and he didn't even know how to go look at who was in there.
[03:23:49.856 --> 03:23:52.837]  But Flynn knew, so they got rid of him because he did know.
[03:23:53.908 --> 03:23:57.514]  Well, and they waited, actually, for Flynn to list all the White Hats before they got rid of him.
[03:23:57.935 --> 03:24:00.019]  I know, because I represented some of those White Hats.
[03:24:00.860 --> 03:24:03.084]  And Mueller went after every single one.
[03:24:03.725 --> 03:24:07.692]  So Flynn creates a list of who's good and who's bad, and then the enemy uses it as a targeting list.
[03:24:08.686 --> 03:24:09.426]  That's exactly right.
[03:24:09.527 --> 03:24:10.307]  And that's what they did.
[03:24:10.787 --> 03:24:18.832]  And we're going to continue to see escalation between now and Election Day, because this is probably one of the most consequential elections in American history.
[03:24:19.272 --> 03:24:20.713]  Does lawfare get rewarded?
[03:24:21.073 --> 03:24:22.734]  Does the deep state get protected?
[03:24:23.275 --> 03:24:28.858]  Or do we finally, you know, restore the American Constitutional Republic by electing
[03:24:29.618 --> 03:24:32.240]  People who can make a meaningful institutional change.
[03:24:32.261 --> 03:24:32.781]  No, I totally agree.
[03:24:32.801 --> 03:24:35.743]  So let me shift to Viva and you, Chase, if you have any time.
[03:24:36.224 --> 03:24:38.325]  Let's talk about the conviction.
[03:24:38.345 --> 03:24:40.707]  Obviously, the poll numbers show what we predicted.
[03:24:40.727 --> 03:24:41.228]  It ain't hard.
[03:24:41.248 --> 03:24:42.709]  I don't need a computer to tell me.
[03:24:43.129 --> 03:24:44.130]  Trump's gone up even again.
[03:24:46.152 --> 03:24:47.193]  Panic is setting in.
[03:24:47.513 --> 03:24:49.755]  Disagree if you do, but I don't think you're going to disagree with that.
[03:24:49.775 --> 03:24:51.396]  We're watching the same sunrise right here.
[03:24:51.936 --> 03:24:52.837]  What's going to happen now?
[03:24:52.857 --> 03:24:55.659]  Because they are in full shit britches mode right now.
[03:24:57.381 --> 03:24:58.642]  Robert, you want to do it first?
[03:24:59.693 --> 03:25:04.941]  Well, I mean, I think the risk we're going to continue to see escalation and the question is where we see that escalation.
[03:25:05.381 --> 03:25:15.436]  I think what you put out earlier today is important, reminding people don't take the bait on any J6 type action or the action that they could call a J6 type action.
[03:25:15.856 --> 03:25:18.598]  Yeah, false flags are their only hope.
[03:25:18.718 --> 03:25:20.659]  Violence is their only hope.
[03:25:20.719 --> 03:25:26.402]  And I keep getting these messages, Viva, you're not going to vote your way out of tyranny, you're not going to mock your way out of this.
[03:25:26.702 --> 03:25:31.565]  And I was like, I won't call them feds because I don't want to call them feds, but I get the sneaking suspicion.
[03:25:32.405 --> 03:25:33.146]  They're not even feds.
[03:25:33.166 --> 03:25:39.450]  They get, you'll give me $1,000 for every post to say Alex Jones isn't being shut down and people are pussies for nonviolence.
[03:25:39.690 --> 03:25:42.652]  No, I don't need, I have the human AI guy gave me.
[03:25:42.912 --> 03:25:51.578]  When I see X flooded with Alex Jones isn't being shut down and we should kill all the feds and it's time for war and everybody's put, they're being told to do it.
[03:25:51.858 --> 03:25:53.159]  So mark those accounts, folks.
[03:25:53.179 --> 03:25:54.540]  They're getting money to do it.
[03:25:56.001 --> 03:25:56.642]  Go ahead, David, sorry.
[03:25:58.219 --> 03:26:11.928]  My only, it's not a fear hiding a wish, it's a fear hiding a nightmare, is that the easiest thing for them to do is to stage something of a false flag against Biden and say these mega, extreme mega Republicans can't be trusted.
[03:26:12.169 --> 03:26:12.889]  Look what they've done.
[03:26:13.710 --> 03:26:15.111]  Biden can't run anymore.
[03:26:15.131 --> 03:26:17.392]  I think they may assassinate him and blame Trump.
[03:26:17.492 --> 03:26:18.313]  I think that's the move.
[03:26:18.653 --> 03:26:27.162]  Well, and then replace him with Kamala or Gavin and say, though detestable, this is your moral vote against extreme mag-republicanism.
[03:26:27.982 --> 03:26:29.164]  That's my biggest concern.
[03:26:29.304 --> 03:26:32.167]  And you resolve a number of issues at the same time.
[03:26:32.627 --> 03:26:34.649]  One, Biden is corrupt and unelectable.
[03:26:35.070 --> 03:26:42.237]  Two, Kamala and Gavin are unelectable, except if you have the sympathy vote and the protest vote, which is what happens if you actually
[03:26:42.897 --> 03:26:44.938]  Oh yeah, I mean my mother is super smart.
[03:26:44.978 --> 03:26:46.319]  She never tells me what's going on.
[03:26:46.679 --> 03:26:48.220]  She never gives me her opinion, but she's smart.
[03:26:48.620 --> 03:26:50.982]  She told me for two years they're going to kill Biden, blame Trump.
[03:26:51.322 --> 03:26:53.063]  That's going to be their secret in 2024.
[03:26:53.443 --> 03:27:03.329]  And that would be, if I was them, and I'm not evil, but I could look at it, they would kill Biden, blame a Trump supporter, make him a victim, and then bring in a sympathy vote, Big Mike or Gavin Newsom.
[03:27:03.889 --> 03:27:08.357]  Exactly, and the third prong of that, restrict voting access.
[03:27:08.417 --> 03:27:11.101]  It's too dangerous to do it in person right now, we need to do it by mail.
[03:27:11.141 --> 03:27:15.929]  And then restrict this video that's going to have 5 million views, then it'll get 100 million when they kill him.
[03:27:18.637 --> 03:27:25.164]  Look, I felt dirty for having the thought, but Alex, I'm listening to the Great Awakening.
[03:27:25.845 --> 03:27:27.727]  Think like the most evil person you could.
[03:27:28.027 --> 03:27:28.568]  What would you do?
[03:27:28.668 --> 03:27:30.310]  That's how I write the Jean Le Carre book.
[03:27:30.730 --> 03:27:31.011]  Robert?
[03:27:31.091 --> 03:27:32.332]  No, that's how we beat them.
[03:27:32.352 --> 03:27:35.315]  Because as good people, we're like, I'm going to go home and have dinner with my wife and kids.
[03:27:35.335 --> 03:27:36.397]  I'm going to get in the pool.
[03:27:36.477 --> 03:27:37.478]  I'm going to go see my neighbors.
[03:27:37.558 --> 03:27:38.219]  I'm going to go to church.
[03:27:39.480 --> 03:27:39.560]  Yes.
[03:28:02.179 --> 03:28:08.103]  Well, and I think, I hope Trump, I think Trump can provide some insurance for himself with his VP choice.
[03:28:08.583 --> 03:28:12.325]  That he needs to pick someone who's life insurance, not risk.
[03:28:12.686 --> 03:28:17.228]  Oh yeah, what do you think of Rubio or Trump?
[03:28:17.449 --> 03:28:18.789]  Who do you think we should get as VP?
[03:28:18.990 --> 03:28:19.530]  Tim Scott.
[03:28:20.322 --> 03:28:30.731]  Well, I mean, definitely not Tim Scott, definitely not Marco Rubio, definitely not anybody, not Nikki Haley, not anybody who the deep state would feel very comfortable with.
[03:28:30.771 --> 03:28:31.651]  But who's the best?
[03:28:31.671 --> 03:28:34.534]  Would you go with Devin Nunes?
[03:28:34.594 --> 03:28:35.795]  Would you go with Rand Paul?
[03:28:37.279 --> 03:28:38.720]  I think either one of those is good.
[03:28:38.900 --> 03:28:39.540]  I think J.D.
[03:28:39.600 --> 03:28:40.560]  Vance is good.
[03:28:40.800 --> 03:28:42.561]  I think Ben Carson is good.
[03:28:42.921 --> 03:28:43.942]  I think Tulsi Gabbard.
[03:28:44.062 --> 03:28:49.944]  All those people are life insurance that the deep state would not trust to run the show outside of Trump.
[03:28:50.284 --> 03:28:51.925]  And that's what he, that should be his number one.
[03:28:51.965 --> 03:28:55.286]  Trump needs a legate that he can trust that will implement his plan.
[03:28:56.323 --> 03:28:56.663]  Exactly.
[03:28:56.723 --> 03:28:58.684]  And someone the Deep State is more scared of than him.
[03:28:59.284 --> 03:29:01.564]  Or as scared of as they are with him.
[03:29:01.744 --> 03:29:10.346]  Because otherwise, the moment Nixon let Agnew be taken out and, you know, decided between Rockefeller and Ford, either one, that was the day he was DOA.
[03:29:10.486 --> 03:29:12.967]  People forget Gerald Ford was on the Warren Commission.
[03:29:13.147 --> 03:29:16.768]  I mean, this guy was back aligned with the Deep State from day one.
[03:29:17.368 --> 03:29:30.030]  And so it's important that they use, you know, that he take the tactically savvy decision, continue to expose these bogus criminal trials for what they are, continue to push a populist reformist agenda.
[03:29:30.230 --> 03:29:30.770]  No, I agree.
[03:29:30.810 --> 03:29:32.991]  So let me ask Viva this question too, but you finish up, Barnes.
[03:29:33.451 --> 03:29:34.711]  How panicked is the Deep State?
[03:29:34.731 --> 03:29:39.432]  Because we see New York Post articles, and then the White House press secretary wouldn't respond.
[03:29:39.452 --> 03:29:43.292]  No, they are in full chicken with a head cutoff moment.
[03:29:43.332 --> 03:29:43.853]  And I don't take that.
[03:29:43.893 --> 03:29:45.033]  It's like, oh yeah, we're winning.
[03:29:45.053 --> 03:29:46.353]  That makes them even more dangerous.
[03:29:49.124 --> 03:29:49.405]  I can.
[03:29:49.565 --> 03:29:50.885]  I'll start half of this answer.
[03:29:52.006 --> 03:29:54.427]  Yeah, they there's nothing they wouldn't.
[03:29:54.888 --> 03:29:57.809]  In my view, there's nothing they wouldn't do, given what they've already done.
[03:29:58.070 --> 03:30:04.113]  And like we're talking about assassinating JFK, assassinating Bobby Kennedy.
[03:30:04.573 --> 03:30:08.176]  And then that's what they did 50 years ago.
[03:30:08.576 --> 03:30:17.281]  And maybe they decide now it's not as easy to do that, given Internet, phones, everything, aggregate knowledge of the Internet, 4chan, and you can't get away with it.
[03:30:18.710 --> 03:30:20.471]  And but they'll do.
[03:30:21.052 --> 03:30:21.792]  They've done everything.
[03:30:21.812 --> 03:30:26.715]  I mean, they've done everything from 2020, which was, I believe, whether or not Covid was real.
[03:30:26.775 --> 03:30:28.216]  I believe it was quasi real.
[03:30:28.516 --> 03:30:29.356]  Lie about death.
[03:30:29.817 --> 03:30:30.797]  Lie about tragedy.
[03:30:30.917 --> 03:30:31.598]  Exaggerated.
[03:30:31.738 --> 03:30:35.960]  Brainwash a population into voting by mail in.
[03:30:36.640 --> 03:30:37.401]  Change the rules.
[03:30:37.421 --> 03:30:41.363]  They're going to just find another way to do this because this is what they did in 2020 and what they did in 2016.
[03:30:41.403 --> 03:30:42.003]  But they failed in 2016.
[03:30:43.562 --> 03:30:46.363]  Interference, censorship, change the rules.
[03:30:46.643 --> 03:30:47.903]  How are they going to do it this time around?
[03:30:48.283 --> 03:30:50.503]  They might try a disease X, but that's too cliched.
[03:30:50.944 --> 03:30:52.504]  It might have to be more cataclysmic.
[03:30:52.904 --> 03:31:00.145]  A World War III with a nuclear weapon going off in Europe, which some people are positing, false flag and whatever, that might be a little too much.
[03:31:01.046 --> 03:31:02.026]  Biden is 81.
[03:31:02.086 --> 03:31:03.826]  He's unelectable.
[03:31:04.066 --> 03:31:05.907]  He's an easy lamb to sacrifice.
[03:31:06.267 --> 03:31:11.748]  And I have my sinister cryptic thoughts, which I will not allow to absorb me, but that's where I went.
[03:31:12.386 --> 03:31:14.988]  Yeah, no, if we're them, they kill Biden and blame Trump supporters.
[03:31:15.028 --> 03:31:16.249]  So, that's the next move.
[03:31:16.869 --> 03:31:20.152]  Obviously, us exposing it may stop it, and literally, that's why they hate the show.
[03:31:20.792 --> 03:31:30.720]  Barnes, if I was the establishment, I would back off and think, I'll win in 20 years, I'll go away.
[03:31:30.760 --> 03:31:36.604]  But they're not doing it because they're so threatened by China, who's also corrupt and evil, and other groups, they want total control.
[03:31:39.554 --> 03:31:41.455]  This is really a big moment here right now.
[03:31:42.475 --> 03:31:45.217]  They're watching as they attack Trump and everything backfires.
[03:31:46.457 --> 03:31:47.718]  You're really good at wargaming.
[03:31:47.758 --> 03:31:52.741]  If you're in the councils of government, which you've been with Trump, what do you think the bad guys are thinking right now?
[03:31:52.761 --> 03:31:56.262]  Because we need to get next year's news, next month's news today.
[03:31:56.963 --> 03:31:58.303]  Really, put on the thinking cap.
[03:31:58.884 --> 03:31:59.964]  Tell us what you think.
[03:32:00.204 --> 03:32:02.406]  And Viva Frye and also these guys are smart.
[03:32:03.226 --> 03:32:04.166]  What's the enemy going to do?
[03:32:04.186 --> 03:32:05.147]  If you're the enemy, what do they do?
[03:32:06.240 --> 03:32:13.316]  Well, a smart, sophisticated, Kissinger-esque, deep state approach would be to try to cut a deal with Trump.
[03:32:14.068 --> 03:32:17.970]  Well, it would be to say, look, we'll make sure you never serve any time in jail.
[03:32:18.010 --> 03:32:19.951]  We'll make sure you're not actually bankrupted.
[03:32:19.971 --> 03:32:23.072]  We'll make sure that these cases get overturned.
[03:32:23.132 --> 03:32:27.294]  We'll make sure that nothing bad happens to you personally or your family.
[03:32:27.874 --> 03:32:33.696]  And you agree to moderate your deep state opposition policies.
[03:32:33.776 --> 03:32:34.857]  Don't defund us.
[03:32:35.497 --> 03:32:36.938]  Don't purge the personnel.
[03:32:37.658 --> 03:32:40.701]  I think he did that six years ago or seven years ago.
[03:32:40.741 --> 03:32:43.543]  I think he now knows they betrayed him and so now Trump knows they're not honest dealers.
[03:32:57.233 --> 03:32:58.154]  I don't know.
[03:33:14.892 --> 03:33:19.656]  If he doesn't choose any of those people, then that means no deal has been cut and he's not even contemplating it.
[03:33:20.297 --> 03:33:22.018]  So then the next step is what they would do.
[03:33:22.299 --> 03:33:25.982]  Still a smart, sophisticated deep state would be to try to plant people around him.
[03:33:27.243 --> 03:33:32.949]  People like, you know, there's certain campaign people that are already infiltrated his camp that have that background.
[03:33:33.609 --> 03:33:38.634]  And to try to moderate, well make sure his personnel choices are more our choices than his people.
[03:33:39.150 --> 03:33:40.931]  So a rerun of last time?
[03:33:40.991 --> 03:33:43.951]  And they go on MSNBC with 100,000 viewers and they think that's the whole world.
[03:33:43.971 --> 03:33:44.571]  They think they're winning.
[03:33:44.591 --> 03:33:44.932]  They're not.
[03:34:05.891 --> 03:34:06.371]  Oh, exactly.
[03:34:06.411 --> 03:34:08.052]  I mean, they very much imbubbled the universe.
[03:34:08.272 --> 03:34:09.973]  You can see that in live time and social media.
[03:34:10.193 --> 03:34:15.235]  They really thought this verdict would totally change the election outcome and trajectory.
[03:34:15.395 --> 03:34:18.756]  But it does seem it's dawning on them, so what are they going to do now?
[03:34:19.946 --> 03:34:21.087]  Yeah, that's the question.
[03:34:21.147 --> 03:34:24.228]  What happens when they fully realize that this strategy doesn't work?
[03:34:24.588 --> 03:34:27.170]  It'll probably take them a couple of months for them to really realize that.
[03:34:27.530 --> 03:34:29.851]  That's when the fall gets really scary.
[03:34:30.151 --> 03:34:32.412]  We might have one of the worst October surprises ever.
[03:34:32.853 --> 03:34:35.974]  May I add, Robert, the fall was almost a pun.
[03:34:36.955 --> 03:34:37.515]  The fall.
[03:34:37.535 --> 03:34:40.576]  I mean, I remember hearing it, and I remember what I thought.
[03:34:40.777 --> 03:34:45.959]  And, Robert, you said it, and as I pulled it up, Ivana Trump, ex-wife, former President Trump, died from fall.
[03:34:46.219 --> 03:34:47.000]  Is there anybody who
[03:34:47.720 --> 03:34:58.002]  Is there anybody who plausibly or has reasonable cause to suggest, think that that's an indication, a sign, or do we... No, she's been a big defender of Trump and she gets thrown down the stairs.
[03:34:58.022 --> 03:35:00.222]  I don't know what your angle is, but I want to hear it.
[03:35:00.482 --> 03:35:00.802]  Barnes?
[03:35:01.002 --> 03:35:11.664]  Well, no, my only query at the time is whether or not... I'm thinking cynically and almost conspiratorially, Alex, but I know that that's turned out to be more accurate over time than not.
[03:35:12.204 --> 03:35:14.125]  And no matter how cynically you get, it's hard to keep up.
[03:35:14.205 --> 03:35:14.745]  Lily Tomlin.
[03:35:15.345 --> 03:35:18.249]  His ex-wife dies by falling down the stairs.
[03:35:18.550 --> 03:35:23.016]  I've never known anybody in my entire life that has died by falling down the stairs.
[03:35:23.236 --> 03:35:24.578]  I know a guy died falling down the stairs.
[03:35:25.379 --> 03:35:25.940]  Was he drunk?
[03:35:26.120 --> 03:35:27.302]  It's rare, but it happens.
[03:35:27.642 --> 03:35:27.983]  He was drunk.
[03:35:28.672 --> 03:35:30.132]  Yeah, well, OK, I should say that.
[03:35:30.192 --> 03:35:31.393]  Let me qualify that.
[03:35:31.873 --> 03:35:34.373]  Not being drunk and not having an underlying issue.
[03:35:34.633 --> 03:35:37.974]  I always think maybe they had a stroke from the jab or drunk or on drugs.
[03:35:38.014 --> 03:35:38.374]  That's fine.
[03:35:38.854 --> 03:35:45.716]  But like that happens and people seem to have forgotten about his ex-wife dying by falling down the stairs.
[03:35:46.076 --> 03:35:49.557]  I don't know what threats could have, would have or were issued against the family members.
[03:35:50.797 --> 03:35:54.178]  I just I retrospectively reassess that piece of information.
[03:35:54.887 --> 03:35:58.830]  Well, I mean, what they've done in some other places is literally try to lock people up, like in Pakistan.
[03:35:59.991 --> 03:36:09.359]  They assassinate people, like we've seen attempted assassinations of MBS in Saudi Arabia, attempted assassination of the President of Slovakia, attempted assassinations elsewhere.
[03:36:09.379 --> 03:36:13.443]  They're attempting both coups and assassinations of Putin repeatedly over the last several years.
[03:36:14.203 --> 03:36:16.544]  So you could see that script being unmasked.
[03:36:16.564 --> 03:36:21.105]  But the other one is, get us into something that takes everybody off the front page.
[03:36:21.125 --> 03:36:28.507]  By the way, I think they killed the Iranian president because he made a backroom deal with Israel and Biden for the money and was part of a larger plan and Iran realized it was a setup.
[03:36:28.747 --> 03:36:30.527]  That's just my quick gestalt analysis.
[03:36:30.887 --> 03:36:34.608]  Clearly the Slovakian Prime Minister they tried to kill, that was a NATO operation.
[03:36:34.868 --> 03:36:37.129]  Yeah, we're in the season of false flags and assassinations.
[03:36:39.645 --> 03:36:45.889]  I just saw this in the chat in Rumble, Robert, and Alex, his sister died, Marianne Trump Barry.
[03:36:46.410 --> 03:36:48.631]  Retired judge and Donald Trump's sister dies.
[03:36:48.791 --> 03:36:50.953]  The thing is, at a given age, people die.
[03:36:51.133 --> 03:36:51.893]  I can appreciate that.
[03:36:52.454 --> 03:37:01.139]  I just say, if you're going to try to coerce some sort of compliance out of somebody, it's going to be threats on the younger family, their children and grandchildren.
[03:37:02.280 --> 03:37:03.201]  Depending on the circumstances.
[03:37:03.521 --> 03:37:04.262]  That's where I would go.
[03:37:04.502 --> 03:37:05.343]  I mean, I don't know.
[03:37:05.363 --> 03:37:08.405]  Now I'm putting two and two together and I might be getting six.
[03:37:08.905 --> 03:37:11.347]  But it doesn't mean that there's not a two that I'm missing in there.
[03:37:12.248 --> 03:37:14.089]  Robert, what were you saying a moment ago?
[03:37:14.750 --> 03:37:20.954]  Well, I just think we have to be on alert and to be self-conscious and to continue to fight the good cause.
[03:37:21.174 --> 03:37:22.275]  Well, that was my next question, though.
[03:37:22.295 --> 03:37:24.537]  I go back to the question you didn't answer because we interrupted you five times.
[03:37:25.117 --> 03:37:28.420]  What do you think the deep state's thinking right now that everything they do turns to shit?
[03:37:30.360 --> 03:37:31.881]  I'm very curious about that.
[03:37:32.821 --> 03:37:48.728]  We both study a lot of history, Alex, so my biggest concern is that it looks a lot like the build-up to World War I. That you have the same kind of incompetent, almost colonialist mindset of a lot of these elites that live in a very sort of imbubbled universe.
[03:37:49.168 --> 03:37:49.609]  We're good to go.
[03:38:04.480 --> 03:38:22.689]  I mean, you had seven centuries of the Austro-Hungarian Empire taken out overnight, and the Ottoman Empire taken out overnight, the Russian Empire taken out overnight, British Empire diminished to almost nothing overnight, to some degree Bismarck's Germany taken out overnight, all because these people made incredibly horrendous decisions.
[03:38:23.369 --> 03:38:25.350]  And the people around Biden are just that bad.
[03:38:26.071 --> 03:38:27.832]  Do they want the Middle East aflame?
[03:38:28.192 --> 03:38:31.374]  Do they want Europe aflame?
[03:38:31.394 --> 03:38:37.518]  Would that be a big enough distraction to allow Biden to be a wartime president and sneak into re-election, even if he's dead?
[03:38:37.638 --> 03:38:43.382]  It's like Netanyahu secretly standing down and working with the Iranians for the attack, so the Iranians figured out and killed their president.
[03:38:44.663 --> 03:38:45.303]  They did it, folks.
[03:38:45.383 --> 03:38:48.745]  I've seen all the evidence.
[03:38:49.386 --> 03:38:51.187]  It's all about keeping Netanyahu in power.
[03:38:52.580 --> 03:38:54.421]  And it's just like, it's the same thing here.
[03:38:54.482 --> 03:38:56.923]  Have World War III so the left stays in power?
[03:38:56.943 --> 03:38:58.405]  Like, how dumb is this, man?
[03:38:59.065 --> 03:39:02.248]  I think it all goes back, I think a lot of it goes back to... Go ahead Chase, go ahead, I've been talking.
[03:39:02.288 --> 03:39:06.871]  I just wanted to say, I think a lot of it goes back to keeping the dollars, the global reserve currency.
[03:39:07.131 --> 03:39:15.278]  We know that the intelligence community inherently has a very utilitarian, Machiavellian approach to how it makes decisions and strategies and tactics, right?
[03:39:15.298 --> 03:39:20.682]  So, it's okay to kill a thousand people if we believe that the estimates are 10,000 people... And that's the excuse.
[03:39:20.942 --> 03:39:21.222]  Right, that's
[03:39:42.295 --> 03:39:44.576]  There's rumors that Kenya's involved in smuggling uranium to Iran.
[03:39:44.897 --> 03:39:50.980]  It all seems like we have over-sanctioned our competitors, our enemies, our allies.
[03:39:51.101 --> 03:39:51.401]  Oh, the U.S.
[03:39:51.481 --> 03:39:52.261]  is definitely over-sanctioned.
[03:39:52.281 --> 03:39:52.682]  Over 50 years.
[03:39:52.762 --> 03:40:00.967]  And so Russia and China and Iran are trying to get something other than the dollar happening over there, and we're trying to stop that from happening because our money's fake.
[03:40:01.267 --> 03:40:05.590]  We have to have the global reserve status, otherwise our whole entire economy could collapse.
[03:40:05.750 --> 03:40:07.591]  Well, then trying to bully them makes it weaker.
[03:40:07.711 --> 03:40:15.655]  Yeah, I think the intelligence community is always, basically every war that we've been involved in for the last 50 years has been because the intelligence community- Propping up Bretton Woods.
[03:40:16.176 --> 03:40:16.976]  Yes, exactly.
[03:40:17.256 --> 03:40:17.576]  Exactly.
[03:40:17.896 --> 03:40:21.038]  We didn't need the oil in Iraq, but we needed the oil in Iraq to be traded in dollars.
[03:40:21.899 --> 03:40:23.700]  You know, so they're like, oh, they didn't take any of the oil.
[03:40:23.720 --> 03:40:25.260]  It's like, yeah, but it's about how the oil's traded.
[03:40:25.741 --> 03:40:27.342]  It's an artificial demand for our currency.
[03:40:27.382 --> 03:40:27.922]  Great point.
[03:40:27.962 --> 03:40:29.443]  So what do you see on the war front, guys?
[03:40:32.044 --> 03:40:35.466]  Robert, I'm going to let you answer and think about my answer in the meantime.
[03:40:37.072 --> 03:40:39.694]  You have power-mad individuals who are not very bright.
[03:40:41.676 --> 03:40:44.598]  With Biden, you can predict him by thinking of a street-level thug.
[03:40:46.259 --> 03:40:47.580]  That's why he couldn't help himself.
[03:40:47.881 --> 03:40:52.905]  When he's asked the question, what about Trump blaming you for his conviction?
[03:40:53.005 --> 03:40:54.827]  And he smiles and does a little dance.
[03:40:55.658 --> 03:40:56.579]  Exactly.
[03:40:57.019 --> 03:40:59.641]  Because that's what a street-level thug thinks a lot, right?
[03:40:59.702 --> 03:41:04.606]  Now, a smart, sophisticated criminal would know not to do that, but that's not who Biden is.
[03:41:05.126 --> 03:41:06.808]  Yeah, but I would say this is tragic.
[03:41:06.868 --> 03:41:08.609]  I'm so sorry this has happened.
[03:41:08.629 --> 03:41:09.570]  I'm sorry he did that.
[03:41:09.610 --> 03:41:10.431]  It's just terrible.
[03:41:10.871 --> 03:41:12.172]  And so he's like, yeah, I did it.
[03:41:12.192 --> 03:41:12.873]  I did it.
[03:41:12.893 --> 03:41:15.115]  I didn't graduate in the first half of my class, but I did it.
[03:41:16.206 --> 03:41:16.906]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:41:17.047 --> 03:41:18.407]  I mean, he wanted the credit for it.
[03:41:18.447 --> 03:41:19.808]  He wanted the attention for it.
[03:41:19.828 --> 03:41:38.279]  There's a real jealousy for real American presidents who wasn't perfect, like Nixon or Kennedy, because the system wants to make the decisions themselves and be that middleman Trump talked about, where he discovered China's getting less money out of running the world's economy and industry for the few dozen middlemen.
[03:41:38.299 --> 03:41:39.520]  And Trump's like, we're cutting them out.
[03:41:40.260 --> 03:41:41.621]  It'll be better for China and the U.S.
[03:41:41.661 --> 03:41:42.722]  China actually liked that.
[03:41:43.322 --> 03:41:50.166]  Now we learn that China actually liked what Trump was doing, beating them, but he was going to say, hey, you're not going to dominate my people.
[03:41:50.506 --> 03:41:53.468]  We're going to give them the bigger piece of money and you'll get a slice too.
[03:41:53.988 --> 03:41:56.169]  I mean, that is just so incredible, Barnes.
[03:41:56.189 --> 03:41:56.829]  I'm sorry I'm interrupting.
[03:41:56.850 --> 03:41:57.090]  Go ahead.
[03:41:57.870 --> 03:42:00.852]  Well, let me bring up that just so everybody sees the video.
[03:42:00.872 --> 03:42:02.853]  The day after, to begin.
[03:42:02.873 --> 03:42:04.174]  This is Joe Biden.
[03:42:04.194 --> 03:42:05.034]  Thank you very much.
[03:42:05.835 --> 03:42:08.056]  Mr. President, can you tell us, sir,
[03:42:08.911 --> 03:42:12.592]  Donald Trump considers himself as a political prisoner and blames you directly.
[03:42:12.632 --> 03:42:14.052]  What's your response to that, sir?
[03:42:16.273 --> 03:42:18.173]  Can you believe this is reality?
[03:42:18.193 --> 03:42:22.874]  He might be senile, chalk it up to senility.
[03:42:24.595 --> 03:42:25.555]  He wanted that credit.
[03:42:25.735 --> 03:42:27.355]  Remember a few years ago?
[03:42:27.455 --> 03:42:29.956]  Yeah, this prosecutor was investigating me and my son.
[03:42:29.976 --> 03:42:32.296]  I gave him an hour to fire him and he got fired.
[03:42:32.876 --> 03:42:34.197]  Son of a bitch, he fired him.
[03:42:35.632 --> 03:42:37.813]  He used to go around and tell people, you don't F with the Bidens.
[03:42:38.133 --> 03:42:39.274]  This is the way he thinks.
[03:42:39.334 --> 03:42:42.275]  He thinks of street-level criminal activity.
[03:42:42.496 --> 03:42:45.937]  The question is this, and I'll ask Robert and Alex and Chase.
[03:42:47.218 --> 03:42:53.141]  Some people are positing that there'll have to be some false flag nuclear potential in Europe.
[03:42:53.161 --> 03:42:55.782]  I can't even understand what happens if that happens.
[03:42:56.123 --> 03:42:59.124]  Some people are saying there's going to be fighting within the Islamic community.
[03:42:59.144 --> 03:43:01.205]  I mean, I gut-level feel nuclear war.
[03:43:01.926 --> 03:43:04.407]  And yeah, I'm worried about a NATO false flag, yeah.
[03:43:05.707 --> 03:43:08.128]  That's the greatest risk right there.
[03:43:08.509 --> 03:43:10.450]  They're trying to provoke Putin into doing it.
[03:43:13.791 --> 03:43:21.335]  I just say, living on the peninsula of Florida, if an atomic bomb goes off in the Atlantic, a tsunami will wash over all of Florida.
[03:43:21.875 --> 03:43:24.637]  Will a dinghy or my kayak in the garage save me?
[03:43:25.737 --> 03:43:27.338]  I'm actually an expert on nuclear war.
[03:43:28.019 --> 03:43:30.540]  I'm not a nuclear silo operator.
[03:43:30.580 --> 03:43:33.762]  I'm not a RAND Corporation nuclear war specialist.
[03:43:34.942 --> 03:43:38.405]  I just, for whatever reason from a young age, thought warfare was very interesting.
[03:43:38.485 --> 03:43:42.848]  So by 10, I was reading PhD level books on nuclear war equations.
[03:43:43.629 --> 03:43:45.190]  And so this is something I talk about.
[03:43:45.250 --> 03:43:48.572]  I know all about the supers, all about the other systems, the neutron bombs, all of it.
[03:43:49.173 --> 03:44:01.301]  There is no war game by the Rand Corporation or by the Pentagon or the Chinese or the Russians or the EU or any group where a tactical nuke is used and in most equations, within a few hours,
[03:44:02.122 --> 03:44:06.305]  There is a larger exchange, and within a day, there is a full exchange.
[03:44:06.345 --> 03:44:08.927]  So this isn't like, this is dominoes falling.
[03:44:09.508 --> 03:44:15.212]  So, 90 plus percent of the equations lead to full nuclear Armageddon, full commitment.
[03:44:15.453 --> 03:44:18.575]  And that means once it starts, India and Pakistan are going to hit each other.
[03:44:18.895 --> 03:44:19.876]  China's going to hit India.
[03:44:19.976 --> 03:44:20.837]  India's going to hit them.
[03:44:21.297 --> 03:44:23.959]  It's nuclear winter in the Northern Hemisphere.
[03:44:23.979 --> 03:44:27.062]  90% of us are urban.
[03:44:27.442 --> 03:44:30.785]  Only 5% are self-sufficient in major Pentagon actuaries.
[03:44:32.010 --> 03:44:40.097]  The nuclear war will kill a billion people in 40 minutes, and then the collapse will kill 6 billion.
[03:44:40.377 --> 03:44:46.503]  There might be a billion people left in the southern hemisphere, and there'll be total war and collapse there, but that'll be road warrior down there.
[03:44:46.563 --> 03:44:47.443]  We'll all be dead here.
[03:44:47.764 --> 03:44:49.825]  There is, let me explain something.
[03:44:50.366 --> 03:44:52.708]  There is no tactical nuke, as General Flynn says.
[03:44:53.529 --> 03:44:54.149]  There is no.
[03:44:54.429 --> 03:44:58.152]  The minute nukes are used, everyone goes apeshit and starts hitting each other.
[03:44:58.353 --> 03:44:59.894]  That's rank corporation doctrine.
[03:45:00.194 --> 03:45:10.962]  I think that's why our intelligence community, as well as the rest of NATO, has been so antagonistic toward Russia as well, because it seems to me that we know that Putin is not a rash leader.
[03:45:11.042 --> 03:45:11.543]  He's measured.
[03:45:11.563 --> 03:45:13.044]  You can say he's a villain, you can say he's a hero.
[03:45:13.084 --> 03:45:14.085]  There's arguments for both sides.
[03:45:14.105 --> 03:45:15.486]  He's probably a combination of both.
[03:45:15.506 --> 03:45:16.226]  He's certainly cold.
[03:45:16.286 --> 03:45:19.569]  But once it starts... But the next person could be a madman.
[03:45:19.889 --> 03:45:21.971]  Yeah, getting rid of him will only bring in a hardliner, but that's the point.
[03:45:22.431 --> 03:45:23.032]  The minute
[03:45:23.712 --> 03:45:31.576]  The West, probably the West will detonate a nuke, say Putin did it, they already had a missile, you know, last year, went into, went into Poland, and then simply said, nuke Russia right now!
[03:45:31.636 --> 03:45:36.819]  They did it, but the Poles shot it down and got the tell number, it was a Ukrainian missile, it was two missiles.
[03:45:37.319 --> 03:45:48.065]  So what I'm saying is, they're already pre-programming this, they're already saying this, because they've got bunkers, and that will knock all their political opposition out, they'll re-emerge as the new government.
[03:45:48.105 --> 03:45:51.387]  You watch Dr. Strangelove, which was based off information that came out,
[03:45:51.927 --> 03:45:55.768]  In the early 60s, where Curtis LeMay and L.L.
[03:45:55.808 --> 03:46:06.131]  Lemonsir, the chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, the head of the Air Force, said, we're going to go ahead and nuke Russia, they told Eisenhower, and then we'll only get 40, 30, 40 million killed, and then Eisenhower said, you're fired.
[03:46:06.531 --> 03:46:08.632]  Then they came back, and who worked for L.L.
[03:46:08.652 --> 03:46:09.792]  Lemonsir as the Chief of Staff?
[03:46:10.192 --> 03:46:10.872]  Donald Rumsfeld.
[03:46:11.152 --> 03:46:17.314]  So these people have running news articles that nuclear war is survivable, we'll just have a tactical nuclear war.
[03:46:17.554 --> 03:46:17.994]  You don't.
[03:46:18.234 --> 03:46:22.017]  Once the nuke goes off, the Russians, or whatever side, spray missiles.
[03:46:22.457 --> 03:46:22.537]  Okay?
[03:46:22.557 --> 03:46:24.118]  Because you can't wait once that happens.
[03:46:24.158 --> 03:46:36.327]  The submarines come up, they spray cruise missiles, they spray Tridents, they spray ICBMs, they spray all this, the West sprays it, and then again, Pakistan and India and most actuaries are probably the most likely places to start.
[03:46:36.347 --> 03:46:37.128]  They've got huge arsenals.
[03:46:37.488 --> 03:46:38.269]  They hate each other.
[03:46:38.549 --> 03:46:41.111]  They're gonna, the minute nukes go off, they're gonna fire missiles.
[03:46:41.451 --> 03:46:42.572]  China's gonna fire missiles.
[03:46:42.712 --> 03:46:45.354]  It is an ape shit, end of the world scenario.
[03:46:46.758 --> 03:46:55.601]  Well, it fits two long-term agendas, which is they're obsessed with population control, you know, Club of Rome, all that jazz, particularly Bill Gates and other people related to him.
[03:46:56.361 --> 03:47:02.243]  And it's long been cited, war and virus are the two main means of population control over time.
[03:47:05.050 --> 03:47:15.338]  You just mentioned, people should be asking, why are there so many rich and powerful, politically active people who've been building special bunkers over the last decade?
[03:47:15.799 --> 03:47:23.805]  What are they preparing for, that they're spending this much money building bunkers all around the world to live and reside in, Strangelove style?
[03:47:24.594 --> 03:47:32.357]  I want to go back, anybody that's ever been in a fight, and I've been in plenty, wish I wasn't, but the point was, crazy days in Dallas.
[03:47:33.418 --> 03:47:36.839]  You don't sit there and get in a fight with somebody and start halfway hitting them.
[03:47:37.039 --> 03:47:39.120]  Once the fight starts, it's full power.
[03:47:39.700 --> 03:47:41.141]  So that's the way nuclear war works.
[03:47:41.421 --> 03:47:46.343]  Once one goes off, all of us in the West are dead in one hour.
[03:47:47.222 --> 03:47:50.405]  Okay, so, 30 minutes probably.
[03:47:51.166 --> 03:48:00.295]  So there's nuclear submarines in the Gulf of Mexico, they're in the Atlantic, they're everywhere, and you hear the Pentagon going, oh God, we don't have enough submarines, the Russians and Chinese have more than we do, and they've got cruise missiles.
[03:48:00.755 --> 03:48:09.804]  And again, the torpedoes are important, because instead of an airburst, you push some super heavy hydrogen bomb, they've got a lot worse stuff instead of we.
[03:48:10.204 --> 03:48:10.585]  Here's the deal.
[03:48:12.190 --> 03:48:17.434]  There was like 15 years ago in the San Francisco Chronicle, the Pentagon gave a briefing, let the Russians know.
[03:48:18.454 --> 03:48:27.461]  They said we've isolated antimatter and we have an antimatter bomb and our equations will destroy the solar system.
[03:48:28.525 --> 03:48:30.887]  We think Pluto might still be there.
[03:48:31.427 --> 03:48:31.948]  So what?
[03:48:32.708 --> 03:48:35.570]  So it goes back to our strange love where they have the doomsday bomb that blows up the whole earth.
[03:48:36.071 --> 03:48:38.613]  That's a metaphor for nuclear war blows it up.
[03:48:39.293 --> 03:48:40.394]  So it doesn't work.
[03:48:41.415 --> 03:48:43.456]  The movie is trying to talk to you like you're five years old.
[03:48:43.817 --> 03:48:48.500]  You start a nuclear war, a doomsday bomb goes up and blows everything, because that's what it is, is a doomsday bomb.
[03:48:48.760 --> 03:48:50.522]  You don't fire the weapon.
[03:48:50.542 --> 03:48:51.682]  I don't walk over to Chase right now.
[03:48:51.762 --> 03:48:52.363]  I'm friends with Chase.
[03:48:52.383 --> 03:48:52.783]  I like Chase.
[03:48:53.043 --> 03:48:57.287]  But if I walked over, Chase is not a pussy, and I just punch him in the nose for no reason, he's going to punch me back.
[03:48:57.907 --> 03:49:00.249]  And then I'm going to jump on top of him and we're going to roll around the ground.
[03:49:00.269 --> 03:49:02.870]  You're going to die.
[03:49:03.091 --> 03:49:04.131]  I'm serious.
[03:49:04.331 --> 03:49:05.933]  Who is bigger between the two of you?
[03:49:06.013 --> 03:49:09.175]  Chase, I have no idea as to are you 5'6 or are you 6'4?
[03:49:09.255 --> 03:49:10.416]  He's taller than me.
[03:49:10.496 --> 03:49:11.436]  I'm 6'2.
[03:49:11.516 --> 03:49:12.197]  Son of a bitch.
[03:49:12.297 --> 03:49:14.478]  Everybody in America is wildly tall.
[03:49:14.498 --> 03:49:14.979]  It's amazing.
[03:49:15.879 --> 03:49:17.319]  I don't have a Napoleonic complex.
[03:49:17.439 --> 03:49:21.320]  I'm not a tough guy, but I've literally bashed the brains out of six people.
[03:49:21.620 --> 03:49:23.081]  But let's move on from that.
[03:49:23.101 --> 03:49:25.101]  Now I'm having a heart attack, I forgot to fight.
[03:49:25.661 --> 03:49:26.281]  Let's move on.
[03:49:26.301 --> 03:49:26.901]  That's not about that.
[03:49:27.181 --> 03:49:29.342]  I'm trying to explain, this is not me.
[03:49:29.982 --> 03:49:32.102]  I read nuclear warfare doctrine, okay?
[03:49:32.823 --> 03:49:33.863]  This is doctrine.
[03:49:33.903 --> 03:49:35.103]  This is not even debatable.
[03:49:35.523 --> 03:49:38.244]  All the mainline analysts admit this, so let's talk about this.
[03:49:38.264 --> 03:49:39.324]  How do we stop this, Barnes?
[03:49:42.004 --> 03:49:47.586]  Hold on, Alex, I'm going to take it back only to the practical level.
[03:49:48.227 --> 03:49:51.908]  We cannot stop nuclear war because there are maniacs out there.
[03:49:52.648 --> 03:49:56.910]  Bottom line, as far as InfoWars is concerned, is there a hearing tomorrow?
[03:49:56.950 --> 03:49:59.851]  When is the next court date for whether or not InfoWars gets shut down?
[03:49:59.871 --> 03:50:07.615]  Yeah, I know everybody's tuned in about us, but I'm just saying, we're important because it's an archetype and a microcosm of the full attack.
[03:50:07.635 --> 03:50:08.475]  So we are important.
[03:50:09.738 --> 03:50:15.101]  But I mean, I had, uh, I was on his show before he was on, uh, Mike Adams, you know, really good guy.
[03:50:15.661 --> 03:50:16.862]  And he said, what can we do to support you?
[03:50:16.902 --> 03:50:20.084]  And I said, I want you to support our videos and our archives and our information.
[03:50:20.144 --> 03:50:21.364]  That's why they want us off the air.
[03:50:22.065 --> 03:50:22.385]  Yeah.
[03:50:22.685 --> 03:50:23.806]  Support me financially.
[03:50:23.846 --> 03:50:24.086]  Great.
[03:50:24.526 --> 03:50:25.567]  I'm in bankruptcy.
[03:50:26.147 --> 03:50:27.728]  I didn't announce we're being taken over.
[03:50:27.828 --> 03:50:28.909]  I don't get any of the money.
[03:50:29.510 --> 03:50:31.531]  I said, free speech systems got great products.
[03:50:31.952 --> 03:50:32.972]  M4's has great products.
[03:50:33.273 --> 03:50:35.574]  You'll get them probably shipped, but if we're gonna be shut down, I don't know.
[03:50:35.835 --> 03:50:37.556]  My dad has DrJonesNaturals.com.
[03:50:38.156 --> 03:50:38.777]  It's over there.
[03:50:38.857 --> 03:50:39.998]  He's got a bunch of great products.
[03:50:40.798 --> 03:50:41.659]  My dad will back me.
[03:50:41.799 --> 03:50:43.100]  I could call my dad at 3 a.m.
[03:50:43.260 --> 03:50:47.844]  I mean, literally, when I was a kid, he would just, my mom was great, but if I had the floor, whatever, he was up with me all night.
[03:50:47.864 --> 03:50:49.866]  That guy is like, I had the best dad ever.
[03:50:50.486 --> 03:50:51.026]  He's incredible.
[03:50:51.506 --> 03:50:53.547]  And my dad is being sued by them.
[03:50:53.607 --> 03:50:54.787]  He's lost everything he's had.
[03:50:55.107 --> 03:50:56.388]  They've sued him for two years.
[03:50:57.068 --> 03:51:03.770]  The Democratic Party, top law firm that Hillary is involved in, runs it all.
[03:51:04.390 --> 03:51:07.151]  And my dad has lost everything.
[03:51:07.551 --> 03:51:08.251]  And he doesn't even care.
[03:51:08.271 --> 03:51:08.951]  He goes, I love you.
[03:51:08.991 --> 03:51:09.251]  Whatever.
[03:51:09.271 --> 03:51:10.692]  He goes, don't submit.
[03:51:10.752 --> 03:51:11.292]  Don't settle.
[03:51:11.332 --> 03:51:11.752]  Don't stop.
[03:51:11.812 --> 03:51:12.152]  I love you.
[03:51:12.732 --> 03:51:19.179]  But when you support DrJonesNaturals.com, you're supporting my dad who said he will do, he will pledge everything.
[03:51:19.199 --> 03:51:21.742]  He says, I'll sell my house, I'll do anything you want.
[03:51:22.903 --> 03:51:23.564]  My dad's a great guy.
[03:51:23.584 --> 03:51:24.986]  If I asked my dad to kill somebody, he'd do it.
[03:51:25.006 --> 03:51:26.407]  I mean, the guy is just the best.
[03:51:27.088 --> 03:51:33.195]  And you support my family, DrJonesNaturals.com, which will be our first sponsor with whatever comes out of this in the future.
[03:51:34.594 --> 03:51:38.077]  And I just can't let my dad down and my mom down.
[03:51:38.517 --> 03:52:00.434]  My mom, about six months ago when they were being harassed and my dad was being attacked and called a criminal in the news, my mother's a big historian, she had a degree in history, and I was at her house and I'm over there on like, you know, Saturday night, we're eating dinner, and the kids go away, they're in the pool, and she comes over to me and she says, she never says hardly anything, but it's always so smart, and she's already been saying they're gonna kill Biden, they're gonna kill Biden for like, you know, two years, and she grabs me by the arm and she says,
[03:52:01.255 --> 03:52:02.515]  You know the Spartans, don't you?
[03:52:02.575 --> 03:52:03.796]  And I said, yeah, Mom, I know the Spartans.
[03:52:03.816 --> 03:52:04.496]  She goes, you know what?
[03:52:05.736 --> 03:52:08.256]  Come home with your shields or on it.
[03:52:09.737 --> 03:52:11.117]  And I said, what do you say?
[03:52:11.157 --> 03:52:13.818]  She says, I don't want to put up with these people.
[03:52:14.158 --> 03:52:15.158]  I don't care what they do to us.
[03:52:15.378 --> 03:52:17.538]  I don't want you to go along with them.
[03:52:17.558 --> 03:52:18.439]  I don't want you to back off.
[03:52:18.519 --> 03:52:19.539]  I said, don't worry, I won't.
[03:52:19.759 --> 03:52:21.759]  She goes, I know you care about them attacking us.
[03:52:22.039 --> 03:52:24.300]  She said, she said, on your shield,
[03:52:25.140 --> 03:52:25.941]  Or with your shield.
[03:52:26.201 --> 03:52:26.842]  She reversed it.
[03:52:27.282 --> 03:52:34.869]  And for those who don't know, the Spartans, who were incredible and held off, you know, 50,000... 300's a cheesy movie.
[03:52:34.929 --> 03:52:36.771]  It's fun, but it's an exaggeration.
[03:52:36.791 --> 03:52:46.940]  But 300 for like a week, till they got betrayed by the spy and all that's true, literally held off hundreds of thousands of Persians at one gap.
[03:52:47.401 --> 03:52:50.784]  And so, the women would say to the men leaving,
[03:52:51.741 --> 03:52:58.045]  Because when you're in a war, when men give up, they drop their swords and shields because the enemy can't run as fast with their swords and shields.
[03:52:58.366 --> 03:53:00.287]  So when you flee, you drop your swords and shields.
[03:53:00.607 --> 03:53:05.571]  And the women, the Spartans would tell their men, you come home with your shields or on them.
[03:53:06.111 --> 03:53:08.473]  You come home victorious or dead.
[03:53:09.193 --> 03:53:16.358]  And my mother, who says, like, one thing a year to me that I should do, and it's always been dialed in, she said, you come home with your shielder on it.
[03:53:16.718 --> 03:53:17.759]  You don't back down.
[03:53:18.059 --> 03:53:18.960]  You don't give in.
[03:53:19.260 --> 03:53:20.621]  We don't care what happens to us.
[03:53:20.901 --> 03:53:22.642]  We want you to attack these people.
[03:53:23.503 --> 03:53:24.884]  And I saluted my mother.
[03:53:24.964 --> 03:53:28.306]  I said, I hugged her and I said, I love you so much, mother.
[03:53:28.666 --> 03:53:29.407]  She said, exactly.
[03:53:29.427 --> 03:53:30.428]  You go to prison.
[03:53:30.748 --> 03:53:31.649]  You get killed.
[03:53:31.949 --> 03:53:33.009]  You never give up.
[03:53:33.069 --> 03:53:34.310]  She looked me right in the eyes.
[03:53:34.871 --> 03:53:36.412]  And I said, I will do it, mother.
[03:53:39.713 --> 03:53:40.934]  That's the only order I got.
[03:53:40.954 --> 03:53:42.674]  It's the only order I need, man.
[03:53:42.734 --> 03:53:49.297]  My mother knows these people are criminals, they know that they're liars, and my mother tells me, die for freedom!
[03:53:51.098 --> 03:53:51.978]  I'm ranting, but go ahead.
[03:53:53.979 --> 03:54:01.563]  Yeah, I think the ultimate answer to any evil is the goodness and righteousness of ordinary, everyday people.
[03:54:02.283 --> 03:54:07.025]  And it's what's worked for all of human history, and it's what will continue to work.
[03:54:07.585 --> 03:54:09.085]  And that's what she said earlier.
[03:54:09.125 --> 03:54:12.126]  These attacks are triggering our epigenetics.
[03:54:12.146 --> 03:54:13.746]  My mother is a nice person.
[03:54:13.826 --> 03:54:15.587]  And she's like, ready for full war.
[03:54:15.607 --> 03:54:15.787]  Yeah.
[03:54:15.807 --> 03:54:16.407]  I'm sorry, keep going.
[03:54:34.141 --> 03:54:34.722]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:54:34.822 --> 03:54:41.667]  One of my great-great-great granddaddies was the gentleman who said, don't shoot until you see the whites of their eyes at Bunker Hill.
[03:54:41.687 --> 03:54:42.588]  I didn't know that.
[03:54:42.628 --> 03:54:52.336]  We lost that day at Bunker Hill, but the way in which we fought at Bunker Hill helped win the American Revolution, which unleashed a revolution of freedom and liberty around the globe.
[03:54:52.737 --> 03:54:53.257]  Well, that's it.
[03:54:53.277 --> 03:54:54.838]  These people fuck with people.
[03:54:54.918 --> 03:54:57.781]  They think Americans were intimidated because we were cowards.
[03:54:57.821 --> 03:54:58.461]  We were asleep.
[03:54:58.962 --> 03:55:01.164]  Now that they're attacking us, people are not scared.
[03:55:01.224 --> 03:55:02.425]  They are ready, Barnes.
[03:55:03.325 --> 03:55:03.905]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:55:03.925 --> 03:55:06.766]  Just continue to stand by the American Constitution.
[03:55:06.826 --> 03:55:10.967]  Fight for it in every legal means available and achievable and attainable to you.
[03:55:11.648 --> 03:55:19.350]  And history shows that it is much more likely to prevail than for the wrongdoers or those who wish harm upon the world will prevail.
[03:55:19.910 --> 03:55:25.272]  So that's the example to continue to live by, is the example that will continue to succeed.
[03:55:26.145 --> 03:55:27.907]  Alex, I'm not I'm not kicking you out.
[03:55:27.927 --> 03:55:28.868]  And there's no but to that.
[03:55:29.228 --> 03:55:33.192]  We're going to we're going to go to our Viva Barnes Law dot locals dot com after party.
[03:55:33.812 --> 03:55:36.995]  We will continue following your story as soon as there's news.
[03:55:37.055 --> 03:55:38.317]  And when there's news, you'll let us know.
[03:55:38.337 --> 03:55:43.261]  And you can I will obviously would never come back on as will Barnes and vice versa.
[03:55:43.822 --> 03:55:46.624]  But I know that you've been live for however long you've been
[03:55:49.250 --> 03:55:50.291]  When are you live next?
[03:55:50.631 --> 03:55:53.352]  And everybody knows where to find you, but what's your next schedule?
[03:55:53.392 --> 03:55:55.033]  Harrison Smith, 8 a.m.
[03:55:55.053 --> 03:56:00.956]  I pointed the law out, the security company, everybody else, so we won't be shut down until tomorrow afternoon.
[03:56:01.456 --> 03:56:08.380]  If the judge orders a shutdown, I don't think that's going to happen because, again, I came in here and called the people and got attention to it, and they backed off.
[03:56:09.400 --> 03:56:10.541]  And then people go, oh, it didn't happen.
[03:56:11.121 --> 03:56:11.721]  There's nothing wrong.
[03:56:11.781 --> 03:56:12.782]  No, we stood up.
[03:56:12.882 --> 03:56:14.363]  There's not just evil in the universe.
[03:56:15.063 --> 03:56:17.285]  And then I don't know when we're going to be shut down.
[03:56:17.305 --> 03:56:17.846]  I don't know.
[03:56:17.886 --> 03:56:21.309]  They tried it Friday and they tried it Saturday and we came here and refused to leave.
[03:56:21.749 --> 03:56:23.991]  I do want to go home, sleep in my bed, sleep on my couch two days.
[03:56:24.031 --> 03:56:25.152]  This is like really messed me up.
[03:56:25.533 --> 03:56:25.953]  I'm a wimp.
[03:56:26.814 --> 03:56:28.075]  And so I'll be on at 11 a.m.
[03:56:28.115 --> 03:56:28.535]  Central.
[03:56:29.056 --> 03:56:31.758]  Owen Schroer will be on The War Room, 3 p.m.
[03:56:31.798 --> 03:56:32.098]  Central.
[03:56:32.899 --> 03:56:46.088]  But the minute Pat McGill, the CRO, the federal appointee, the minute he gets an order from a judge, he will shut this down and fiduciarily shut down the money for the plaintiffs and all of it, which he's already tried to do, which is just insane.
[03:56:46.389 --> 03:56:50.732]  So that's where we are, and I thank you both for all the time, and it's been amazing.
[03:56:50.792 --> 03:56:53.273]  Thank you so much, Viva Frye and Robert Barnes.
[03:56:53.574 --> 03:56:54.374]  God bless you both.
[03:56:55.295 --> 03:56:56.556]  Anytime and every time.
[03:56:56.836 --> 03:56:57.436]  We'll see you soon.
[03:56:57.937 --> 03:56:58.697]  I appreciate your support.
[03:56:58.717 --> 03:56:59.318]  I've seen it, guys.
[03:56:59.338 --> 03:56:59.598]  Thank you.
[03:57:00.899 --> 03:57:01.379]  Have a good night.
[03:57:01.940 --> 03:57:02.360]  All right.
[03:57:02.400 --> 03:57:09.025]  I'm going to go a little bit in the next hour because, you know, I need to get home to the family and I'm just going to leave it that way.
[03:57:09.045 --> 03:57:09.826]  We've had some family issues.
[03:57:09.846 --> 03:57:10.886]  My wife's dad died.
[03:57:10.946 --> 03:57:11.927]  It's about complaining.
[03:57:11.947 --> 03:57:12.768]  It's just all coming at once.
[03:57:13.148 --> 03:57:14.389]  When it rains, it pours.
[03:57:14.449 --> 03:57:21.534]  But let's take like a promo or something for five minutes because I say it's a 10% chance we'll be shut down.
[03:57:21.895 --> 03:57:23.235]  That's my best dead reckoning.
[03:57:25.680 --> 03:57:28.102]  Every moment here on air is really, really precious.
[03:57:28.202 --> 03:57:31.664]  And it's a real blessing to be here with all of you.
[03:57:32.245 --> 03:57:40.130]  And I'm very thankful and very heartened and buoyed and emboldened by your loving support.
[03:57:40.150 --> 03:57:42.491]  And I'm very, very appreciative of it, respectfully.
[03:57:43.492 --> 03:57:49.856]  But I am not a genius when it comes to the system and the corrupt New World Order.
[03:57:49.896 --> 03:57:50.757]  I'm not an expert on that.
[03:57:50.777 --> 03:57:51.998]  I just follow God's directives.
[03:57:52.873 --> 03:57:54.335]  I'm not exactly sure what's going to happen.
[03:57:54.376 --> 03:57:56.218]  We barely headed this off.
[03:57:56.238 --> 03:58:00.986]  They thought they just closed the building and I wouldn't be here because they had no dimensional understanding.
[03:58:01.006 --> 03:58:01.747]  We'd still be on air.
[03:58:02.068 --> 03:58:03.750]  It'd probably be even bigger if they just shut it down.
[03:58:04.351 --> 03:58:07.115]  But instead, this is the way it happened because I found out about it.
[03:58:08.277 --> 03:58:09.238]  Just because of instinct.
[03:58:09.818 --> 03:58:11.519]  So, we need your support.
[03:58:11.580 --> 03:58:12.900]  DrJonesNaturals.com.
[03:58:12.921 --> 03:58:13.661]  They're great products.
[03:58:13.861 --> 03:58:14.502]  They're amazing.
[03:58:14.882 --> 03:58:16.123]  All the nano-silver products.
[03:58:17.124 --> 03:58:18.304]  It's all there.
[03:58:18.324 --> 03:58:19.685]  The Next Level Foundational Energy.
[03:58:21.006 --> 03:58:21.987]  The Kava Chill.
[03:58:22.307 --> 03:58:23.308]  The Top Brain.
[03:58:23.368 --> 03:58:24.529]  The Rocket Rest.
[03:58:24.569 --> 03:58:25.310]  Incredible Sleep Aid.
[03:58:25.330 --> 03:58:25.850]  It's all there.
[03:58:26.350 --> 03:58:28.092]  And that's my beat-up parents.
[03:58:29.052 --> 03:58:33.214]  That could be a sponsor or whatever we set in the future.
[03:58:34.075 --> 03:58:36.416]  If you want to support us, that's the place to go, DrNoseNationals.com.
[03:58:36.957 --> 03:58:41.879]  But what I really want you to do is just pray for freedom and pray for President Trump and pray for the world and pray for peace.
[03:58:42.300 --> 03:58:43.300]  Pray to stop nuclear war.
[03:58:44.081 --> 03:58:47.302]  And I just it's such a pleasure and honor to work with everybody.
[03:58:47.843 --> 03:58:50.444]  And I am very nostalgic about the things we've done here together.
[03:58:51.044 --> 03:58:52.665]  And, you know, that's really what I wanted to say.
[03:58:52.705 --> 03:58:55.567]  So let me take a five minute break and re-clear my head.
[03:58:57.728 --> 03:59:01.493]  You know, just just deal with this because, you know, that's where we are.
[03:59:01.653 --> 03:59:02.694]  And this could be the last show.
[03:59:03.335 --> 03:59:07.340]  And I think it's very clear they're going to shut this place down.
[03:59:08.426 --> 03:59:14.592]  And so to any of the idiots out there saying, oh yeah, what, we can go stick cameras in the security guys' faces that were told to shut us down yesterday?
[03:59:14.992 --> 03:59:17.575]  We can go mess with the crew and most of them won't be on TV?
[03:59:17.895 --> 03:59:19.857]  You sit there and act like I would come on air?
[03:59:20.097 --> 03:59:22.419]  You're going to see in federal court tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[03:59:23.040 --> 03:59:25.642]  in Houston where this is all going to be brought out to attack me.
[03:59:25.922 --> 03:59:27.664]  You can go watch the hearing online.
[03:59:27.884 --> 03:59:28.185]  It's there.
[03:59:28.845 --> 03:59:29.145]  Okay?
[03:59:29.366 --> 03:59:31.608]  Judge, what's his name, Chris Lopez or what's his name?
[03:59:32.068 --> 03:59:32.248]  Yeah.
[03:59:32.288 --> 03:59:33.469]  Yeah, just go look it up.
[03:59:34.375 --> 03:59:38.596]  So, and I don't say that because I care about that.
[03:59:38.776 --> 03:59:42.218]  It's those people I know got money when the order went out.
[03:59:42.278 --> 03:59:43.658]  I saw it on hundreds of accounts today.
[03:59:44.038 --> 03:59:44.698]  Oh, it's not real.
[03:59:44.738 --> 03:59:53.361]  It's fake by so-called conservatives that are posing as conservatives with kind of milquetoast stuff and then waiting to suck people in so they can lie to you in control.
[03:59:53.741 --> 04:00:01.104]  So you need to mark the people that said this isn't real to know like a buoy or like a chart with sailors where, hey, there's reefs right here.
[04:00:01.144 --> 04:00:01.864]  These are bad people.
[04:00:02.284 --> 04:00:13.678]  Because this is 100% real, 100% happening, 100% going down, and then they can't believe that we charged in here and I knew the law and said, I'll call the police.
[04:00:13.698 --> 04:00:14.459]  You're not going to do that.
[04:00:15.199 --> 04:00:16.640]  Because they don't believe in humanity.
[04:00:16.660 --> 04:00:18.161]  They don't believe in who we are.
[04:00:18.381 --> 04:00:21.904]  Like when I got up on Jan 6th, when I saw it was a set up, they said, we can't stay there and kill people.
[04:00:21.944 --> 04:00:22.344]  Don't go in.
[04:00:22.524 --> 04:00:23.044]  We're being set up.
[04:00:23.084 --> 04:00:23.445]  Oh my God.
[04:00:23.685 --> 04:00:24.545]  And it all happened.
[04:00:24.906 --> 04:00:25.826]  Like it was obvious.
[04:00:25.886 --> 04:00:30.950]  I knew the, I realized, I thought Trump, I didn't know the Secret Service would stand down, the federal police would, and we were being set up.
[04:00:31.150 --> 04:00:32.231]  They had so many rallies with Trump.
[04:00:32.471 --> 04:00:32.991]  I was just there.
[04:00:33.011 --> 04:00:33.952]  We had a permit.
[04:00:34.172 --> 04:00:35.233]  Trump was going to come to that next year.
[04:00:35.253 --> 04:00:36.774]  He goes, follow Alex Jones, go to the thing.
[04:00:37.014 --> 04:00:37.754]  It was all set up.
[04:00:37.814 --> 04:00:38.335]  Trump didn't know.
[04:00:40.140 --> 04:00:42.602]  And so, I mean, I've been in wars, people.
[04:00:42.622 --> 04:00:44.303]  I've been around 30 years.
[04:00:44.563 --> 04:00:46.045]  War after war after war.
[04:00:46.325 --> 04:00:48.546]  Bohemian Grove, Jan 6, Trump.
[04:00:48.586 --> 04:00:49.547]  I used to advise Trump.
[04:00:49.587 --> 04:00:51.929]  I never wanted to, because I realized I got attacked right away.
[04:00:52.669 --> 04:00:53.930]  So, oh, I don't really talk to Trump.
[04:00:53.950 --> 04:00:54.511]  I don't advise him.
[04:00:54.551 --> 04:00:55.652]  No, I did advise him.
[04:00:55.872 --> 04:00:58.634]  I wrote hundreds of dossiers, reports on everything.
[04:00:58.934 --> 04:01:04.038]  Had law firms with him deliver it into the White House with federal agency heads.
[04:01:05.619 --> 04:01:07.981]  And their answer was to go, oh, we got this meeting for you about this.
[04:01:08.041 --> 04:01:09.282]  It was a sellout meeting.
[04:01:10.322 --> 04:01:12.563]  If I didn't take that, now I'm a Russian agent trying to set me up.
[04:01:12.843 --> 04:01:15.424]  I mean, it's like, I'm a real person.
[04:01:15.684 --> 04:01:16.825]  I'm not like the flat Earth.
[04:01:17.085 --> 04:01:22.007]  I'm not like some candy-ass cube person that tells you they're the secret and everything's fine.
[04:01:22.207 --> 04:01:23.848]  Just talk to them on 4chan, you're gonna find out the truth.
[04:01:24.148 --> 04:01:24.889]  I'm real, man.
[04:01:25.529 --> 04:01:26.329]  I'm 100% real.
[04:01:26.349 --> 04:01:27.730]  I've been doing this 30 years.
[04:01:27.950 --> 04:01:29.010]  This is all I do.
[04:01:29.271 --> 04:01:30.571]  And there's real stuff in the universe.
[04:01:30.791 --> 04:01:31.732]  And you're looking at it.
[04:01:32.752 --> 04:01:34.073]  And it makes me sick.
[04:01:34.901 --> 04:01:44.206]  Makes me sick they're shutting this place down and the very people saying it's not happening in a week will hope you don't even know what they said and did because they're gonna lie to you on the next thing.
[04:01:44.226 --> 04:01:46.247]  And they're gonna lie to you on the next thing.
[04:01:46.267 --> 04:01:47.888]  And they're gonna lie to you on the next thing.
[04:01:48.108 --> 04:01:49.629]  And they're disgusting people.
[04:01:50.940 --> 04:01:52.761]  And some of them I was retweeting and even promoting.
[04:01:53.721 --> 04:01:55.022]  And I realized, oh, that's what that is.
[04:01:55.062 --> 04:01:56.062]  That's the signature of the enemy.
[04:01:56.382 --> 04:01:57.422]  You're not being censored.
[04:01:57.662 --> 04:01:59.523]  You're not being attacked.
[04:01:59.583 --> 04:02:00.603]  You're not being law-affaired.
[04:02:00.964 --> 04:02:01.664]  None of this is real.
[04:02:01.684 --> 04:02:02.624]  They don't want Alex Jones.
[04:02:02.804 --> 04:02:08.486]  They didn't write thousands of articles and thousands of TV programs lying about me and rigged trials and all because, hey, he's not real.
[04:02:08.506 --> 04:02:09.046]  He's not real.
[04:02:09.066 --> 04:02:09.366]  Bullshit!
[04:02:11.601 --> 04:02:12.221]  You're real.
[04:02:12.261 --> 04:02:12.882]  You're listening.
[04:02:12.942 --> 04:02:13.822]  You know you're real.
[04:02:14.042 --> 04:02:15.163]  You know your mama's real.
[04:02:15.403 --> 04:02:16.623]  You know your daddy's real.
[04:02:16.823 --> 04:02:18.064]  You know your grandma was real.
[04:02:18.264 --> 04:02:19.504]  You know your grandpa was real.
[04:02:19.704 --> 04:02:20.685]  You know your kids are real.
[04:02:20.885 --> 04:02:21.445]  You're real.
[04:02:21.665 --> 04:02:22.065]  I'm real.
[04:02:22.265 --> 04:02:23.066]  There's real people.
[04:02:24.126 --> 04:02:25.467]  And you gotta start believing that.
[04:02:25.627 --> 04:02:27.528]  And there's real people that don't know how to back down.
[04:02:28.428 --> 04:02:31.089]  There's real people that don't know how to give up.
[04:02:31.489 --> 04:02:36.351]  There's real people that have the spirit of 1776 in them who don't know how to bow.
[04:02:36.531 --> 04:02:37.732]  Who don't know how to sell out.
[04:02:37.932 --> 04:02:39.733]  Who don't know how to give up.
[04:02:40.771 --> 04:02:40.851]  And
[04:02:55.691 --> 04:02:57.692]  I was young, I knew a lot in 30 years on air, and I learned a lot.
[04:02:57.892 --> 04:03:02.013]  But the last six years of persecution, I learned more how it all works.
[04:03:02.053 --> 04:03:07.274]  How they, when we're exposing one real story, they plan a fake story, discredit that story, and how they operate, and how they move.
[04:03:07.494 --> 04:03:11.055]  And I've just, it's like, now the knowledge is like, I can hardly even talk today.
[04:03:11.135 --> 04:03:14.456]  I was like, literally, couldn't even, before I got on air, even hardly talk.
[04:03:14.716 --> 04:03:19.417]  Because I was getting such giant downloads of crystallization, and understanding, and everything.
[04:03:19.577 --> 04:03:22.838]  Because God's like, okay, you've been faithful, now here's the new weapon level.
[04:03:23.238 --> 04:03:27.019]  Here's the new download, because I'm only giving it right when I need it.
[04:03:27.459 --> 04:03:31.180]  Because God's always like, for whatever reason, God's system works like this.
[04:03:31.480 --> 04:03:33.701]  You're giving it right, like the widow's mind.
[04:03:34.081 --> 04:03:39.082]  She donates it to the prophet, and then there's only, it's all they have, they're going to die, they're going to starve to death.
[04:03:39.322 --> 04:03:43.503]  She gives it to him, the little bit of food they have, and then it just continues, but every day it's refilled.
[04:03:43.763 --> 04:03:49.764]  And that's the story of how you get just what you need, right when you need it, because God is in control.
[04:03:49.864 --> 04:03:51.585]  God wants you to know, it's me.
[04:03:52.245 --> 04:03:52.846]  I'm doing it.
[04:03:53.246 --> 04:03:54.007]  I'm producing it.
[04:03:54.167 --> 04:03:54.888]  I made the planet.
[04:03:55.028 --> 04:03:55.749]  I created the life.
[04:03:56.090 --> 04:03:56.991]  I gave you the abundance.
[04:03:57.151 --> 04:03:57.731]  I did it all.
[04:03:58.152 --> 04:03:58.973]  I will guide you.
[04:03:59.153 --> 04:03:59.734]  I will lead you.
[04:03:59.894 --> 04:04:05.420]  I love you because God gave us free will, but God cheats, and not in a bad way, but like, he's gonna tell us.
[04:04:06.451 --> 04:04:13.634]  Not going to take over our free will, but he's going to lovingly prepare us, lovingly lay out a banquet in front of our enemies when they're attacking us.
[04:04:13.974 --> 04:04:17.776]  As we walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for thou art with me.
[04:04:18.576 --> 04:04:30.901]  And I'm in the highest place of King David, in the highest place of the most high, the quiet place, the place of serenity and pure vision and completion.
[04:04:31.181 --> 04:04:32.602]  But God only gives you five seconds of it.
[04:04:32.802 --> 04:04:34.182]  Because he goes, you got a mission?
[04:04:34.503 --> 04:04:35.363]  Do you want to stay here?
[04:04:37.648 --> 04:04:41.851]  And I knew in those few dreams I had with total completion, God was going to kill me in my sleep.
[04:04:42.491 --> 04:04:43.672]  You've done the mission, son.
[04:04:44.252 --> 04:04:45.273]  Here's total completion.
[04:04:45.893 --> 04:04:46.994]  Do you want this?
[04:04:47.274 --> 04:04:48.115]  You'll get this later.
[04:04:48.135 --> 04:04:49.475]  Or do you want to go back to the mission?
[04:04:50.096 --> 04:04:51.937]  Thank God I knew the answer, but God gave me the free will.
[04:04:51.957 --> 04:04:52.697]  And I said, Daddy,
[04:04:53.638 --> 04:05:03.483]  Punch me right back into the dining circle of hell because I want to do the right thing and help the children because I want to take the children with us to this.
[04:05:03.743 --> 04:05:09.466]  I want to get them and guide them to the real light, to the real elimination, not the false elimination.
[04:05:09.726 --> 04:05:10.366]  I will do it.
[04:05:10.826 --> 04:05:11.947]  I will do it.
[04:05:12.127 --> 04:05:12.967]  I want the mission.
[04:05:13.087 --> 04:05:14.008]  I want to be tortured.
[04:05:14.268 --> 04:05:20.631]  I want to be attacked because I've seen the perfection and I'm not going to punch out of this and leave this right now.
[04:05:20.951 --> 04:05:22.692]  I want to take the people with us.
[04:05:23.152 --> 04:05:25.953]  Satan wants to destroy you and take you with him.
[04:05:26.493 --> 04:05:27.994]  Satan wants to take your free will.
[04:05:28.054 --> 04:05:33.936]  God wants to give you true, true power, true envisioning, everything, knowing everything.
[04:05:34.137 --> 04:05:35.597]  But you've got to choose.
[04:05:36.357 --> 04:05:37.718]  We've got to get the children.
[04:05:38.058 --> 04:05:39.339]  We've got to lead them to the light.
[04:05:39.379 --> 04:05:39.839]  What is that?
[04:05:40.922 --> 04:05:41.622]  It's a Heilemann song.
[04:05:41.943 --> 04:05:43.223]  So we'll go to break, come back in five minutes.
[04:05:43.243 --> 04:05:43.804]  We want to find it.
[04:05:44.504 --> 04:05:46.805]  And it's a Heilemann 3 record or whatever.
[04:05:46.825 --> 04:05:49.807]  It's not as best as the first two, but it's a good song.
[04:05:49.867 --> 04:05:52.789]  Devil worship will think it's cheesy, but it's like, I'm going to live forever.
[04:05:53.169 --> 04:05:54.270]  I'm going to cross that river.
[04:05:55.851 --> 04:05:56.491]  American Remains?
[04:05:57.051 --> 04:05:58.432]  No, that's not American Remains.
[04:05:58.452 --> 04:05:59.333]  That's a good song, too.
[04:06:00.033 --> 04:06:01.414]  I am a shotgun rider.
[04:06:01.554 --> 04:06:01.734]  Right.
[04:06:01.954 --> 04:06:03.295]  The San Jacinto Line.
[04:06:04.316 --> 04:06:05.916]  The desert is my brother.
[04:06:06.417 --> 04:06:07.838]  My skin is cracked and dry.
[04:06:08.538 --> 04:06:09.999]  I was riding on a full coach.
[04:06:11.277 --> 04:06:12.578]  Yeah, no, that's not that one.
[04:06:14.418 --> 04:06:15.099]  This is the song.
[04:06:15.139 --> 04:06:20.361]  Play the whole song, play a clip, and I'm gonna get a glass of water and we're gonna finish up here.
[04:06:20.401 --> 04:06:20.741]  Here we are.
[04:06:21.402 --> 04:06:22.402]  I'm gonna live forever.
[04:06:22.982 --> 04:06:24.183]  I'm gonna cross that river.
[04:06:25.784 --> 04:06:27.424]  Guide the children safely to the light.
[04:06:27.625 --> 04:06:29.085]  Don't let the darkness take them.
[04:06:29.625 --> 04:06:31.166]  Don't make them feel forsaken.
[04:06:31.186 --> 04:06:32.307]  I'm gonna live forever.
[04:06:32.787 --> 04:06:34.568]  I'm gonna cross that river.
[04:06:35.028 --> 04:06:36.549]  I'm gonna catch tomorrow now.
[04:06:39.485 --> 04:07:04.535]  You're gonna want to hold me just like I always told you You're gonna miss me when I'm gone Nobody here will ever find me But I will always be around Just like the songs I leave behind me I'm gonna live forever now
[04:07:16.024 --> 04:07:19.887]  You fathers and you mothers, be good to one another.
[04:07:19.947 --> 04:07:25.032]  Please try to raise your children right.
[04:07:25.092 --> 04:07:26.813]  Don't let the darkness take them.
[04:07:27.314 --> 04:07:29.536]  Don't make them feel forsaken.
[04:07:29.576 --> 04:07:31.738]  Just lead them safely to the light.
[04:07:34.120 --> 04:07:40.906]  When this whole world is blown asunder, and all the stars fall from the sky,
[04:07:43.240 --> 04:07:46.321]  Remember someone really loves you.
[04:07:47.701 --> 04:07:54.063]  We'll live forever, you and I. I'm gonna live forever.
[04:07:54.643 --> 04:07:56.323]  I'm gonna cross that river.
[04:07:56.923 --> 04:07:59.104]  I'm gonna catch tomorrow now.
[04:08:01.464 --> 04:08:02.945]  I'm gonna live forever.
[04:08:03.685 --> 04:08:05.385]  I'm gonna cross that river.
[04:08:05.925 --> 04:08:07.946]  I'm gonna catch tomorrow now.
[04:08:29.795 --> 04:08:31.199]  We're good to go.
[04:09:02.017 --> 04:09:03.818]  Well, I don't know what will happen now.
[04:09:05.218 --> 04:09:07.119]  We've got some difficult days ahead.
[04:09:07.600 --> 04:09:11.401]  But I'm not concerned about that now.
[04:09:11.521 --> 04:09:14.563]  I just want to do God's will.
[04:09:14.723 --> 04:09:17.844]  And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain.
[04:09:18.945 --> 04:09:21.066]  And I've looked over.
[04:09:21.966 --> 04:09:25.327]  And I've seen the promised land.
[04:09:25.408 --> 04:09:26.908]  I may not get there with you.
[04:09:29.378 --> 04:09:36.222]  But I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land!
[04:09:38.083 --> 04:09:38.804]  We gotta come together.
[04:09:39.644 --> 04:09:43.867]  Whether you believe in that or not, you gotta decide whether you have dominion over yourself.
[04:09:44.387 --> 04:09:57.515]  I believe that the majority of the plain people of the United States will, day in and day out, make fewer mistakes in governing themselves than any smaller class or body of men, no matter what their training, will make in trying to govern.
[04:09:58.183 --> 04:10:07.445]  And you gotta decide whether it's God that's gonna have dominion over you, that you get orders from, or whether some other human that's jacked into the evil force is gonna have dominion over you.
[04:10:07.965 --> 04:10:18.668]  What we're talking about now is like a second industrial revolution, but the product this time will not be textiles or machines or vehicles or even weapons.
[04:10:18.988 --> 04:10:22.248]  The product this time will be humans themselves.
[04:10:22.268 --> 04:10:24.469]  Do we want to have a human plan or a post-human plan?
[04:10:25.086 --> 04:10:31.672]  Noval Harari and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates say humans are obsolete, we're scum, because they know we are their competition.
[04:10:31.992 --> 04:10:37.877]  They know that if we go for what we want and what God wants us to have, they can't compete with that transmission.
[04:10:38.278 --> 04:10:39.679]  They can't compete with that blueprint.
[04:10:39.919 --> 04:10:41.460]  They can't compete with that architecture.
[04:10:41.841 --> 04:10:42.942]  They can't compete with that
[04:10:43.502 --> 04:10:44.182]  Master plan.
[04:10:44.682 --> 04:10:45.683]  But I just see it now.
[04:10:46.183 --> 04:10:47.283]  It'll be so clear soon.
[04:10:47.763 --> 04:10:49.584]  Are you pro-human or are you anti-human?
[04:10:49.944 --> 04:10:53.044]  You are the human resistance to this alien takeover.
[04:10:53.444 --> 04:11:00.746]  And again, when I say alien takeover, I don't mean some little tinfoil flying saucer crashing in Roswell from Alpha Centauri.
[04:11:01.266 --> 04:11:11.069]  I'm talking about the transmission in the universe of God's order and God's will, or do you choose to serve the agents of death?
[04:11:11.969 --> 04:11:14.810]  And like Martin Luther King said, we're not going to judge them off what color they are.
[04:11:14.830 --> 04:11:19.951]  We're going to judge them off of the character of their actions and deeds.
[04:11:20.651 --> 04:11:22.591]  So I'm going to say it right now, real clear.
[04:11:23.191 --> 04:11:26.452]  I love everybody, no matter what color your beautiful skin is.
[04:11:27.012 --> 04:11:29.512]  But I care about your heart and your guts and your mind.
[04:11:30.012 --> 04:11:31.833]  And you're under attack by these Satanists.
[04:11:32.013 --> 04:11:33.193]  And they want to kill you!
[04:11:33.213 --> 04:11:34.893]  And they want to kill your children!
[04:11:34.913 --> 04:11:37.554]  And I say we set our differences aside.
[04:11:38.314 --> 04:11:47.763]  And I say we come together and we beat these people and we smash their technocracy and we build the future together and we can do anything with our real diversity.
[04:11:48.403 --> 04:11:50.405]  These enemies tell us all day about diversity.
[04:11:50.665 --> 04:11:54.049]  They mean divided and conquered groups of people separate from each other.
[04:11:54.469 --> 04:11:59.754]  This bill is supported by all of the Democrats, House and Senate.
[04:12:00.535 --> 04:12:02.516]  It's just a filibuster in a way.
[04:12:03.413 --> 04:12:17.179]  So in a way, if you really truly want to honor Dr. King, don't dishonor him by using a congressional custom as an excuse for protecting our democracy.
[04:12:17.199 --> 04:12:22.261]  But I tell you, if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.
[04:12:22.441 --> 04:12:24.142]  I want unity.
[04:12:25.214 --> 04:12:43.544]  Under a code of freedom, and liberty, and justice, and coming together, and working together, and being strong, and that's what InfoWars is, and that's why the enemies of humanity hate us so much, because we love God, and God loves humanity!
[04:12:44.384 --> 04:12:47.369]  And I am a human supremacist!
[04:12:48.050 --> 04:12:50.494]  I am a human supremacist!
[04:12:51.095 --> 04:12:53.198]  I am a human supremacist!
[04:12:53.839 --> 04:12:55.842]  I am a human supremacist!
[04:12:56.403 --> 04:12:59.168]  I am a human supremacist!
[04:12:59.808 --> 04:13:03.333]  That term will be the future war with the robots and the AI.
[04:13:03.493 --> 04:13:08.099]  What you're hearing now is the entire future and everything they tried to stop us from doing.
[04:13:08.499 --> 04:13:11.022]  Our supremacy will not end with this planet.
[04:13:11.583 --> 04:13:13.345]  We will heap all the stars.
[04:13:13.505 --> 04:13:14.446]  We will colonize.
[04:13:14.626 --> 04:13:16.469]  We will green dead worlds.
[04:13:16.929 --> 04:13:18.270]  We will go interdimensional.
[04:13:18.470 --> 04:13:19.990]  We will unlock the secrets of the universe.
[04:13:20.270 --> 04:13:22.831]  God has laid them out like Christmas presents for his children.
[04:13:23.151 --> 04:13:33.755]  And I am extremely honored to be in the fulcrum and the heart of the fight to bring our race, the human race, in a race for the future.
[04:13:34.395 --> 04:13:44.985]  And we will break the enemy, we will break the pedophiles, we will break the Satanists, because God already sent his own self down here to show us he could do it!
[04:13:45.565 --> 04:13:49.328]  God would never ask us to go through an obstacle course he wouldn't go through!
[04:13:49.649 --> 04:13:56.415]  And now we're gonna go through what Christ did, and we're gonna go through it, and we're gonna be destroyed, but reborn on the other side!
[04:14:28.428 --> 04:14:31.530]  All right, Doc Chambers, you've been like a colonel in special operations.
[04:14:31.570 --> 04:14:32.411]  You're here right now.
[04:14:32.431 --> 04:14:39.977]  You're an amazing patriot, you know, very well known as a really one of the best operators out there and a medical doctor.
[04:14:40.037 --> 04:14:41.878]  And I really got to know your fellow Texan.
[04:14:42.819 --> 04:14:44.720]  You called me driving back into town last night.
[04:14:44.740 --> 04:14:45.801]  You said, hey, we're ready to help you.
[04:14:45.821 --> 04:14:48.743]  And I know you guys are experts in overthrowing government.
[04:14:48.783 --> 04:14:53.187]  So I'm so mind blown because I can usually sleep really good.
[04:14:53.847 --> 04:14:54.948]  I haven't slept for two days.
[04:14:54.968 --> 04:14:57.249]  I get up five minutes later.
[04:14:58.150 --> 04:14:58.790]  I can't sleep.
[04:14:58.910 --> 04:14:59.931]  Two days I've been on the couch.
[04:14:59.951 --> 04:15:01.471]  They were going to shut this down Friday.
[04:15:01.511 --> 04:15:02.012]  We discovered it.
[04:15:02.032 --> 04:15:03.052]  They were going to shut it down last night.
[04:15:03.092 --> 04:15:03.633]  We stopped them.
[04:15:03.653 --> 04:15:04.773]  I said I'm going to call the police.
[04:15:04.793 --> 04:15:05.434]  You don't have an order.
[04:15:05.774 --> 04:15:06.734]  It shows desperation.
[04:15:06.754 --> 04:15:08.295]  They didn't even have a court order to do it.
[04:15:08.315 --> 04:15:10.737]  It was a CR appointed by the court outside of the store doing it.
[04:15:11.177 --> 04:15:13.118]  I don't see that as me being that important.
[04:15:13.618 --> 04:15:16.300]  Other than there's something big about to happen.
[04:15:16.800 --> 04:15:18.261]  I don't know if it was a Trump assassination.
[04:15:18.281 --> 04:15:19.001]  I don't know what it is.
[04:15:19.061 --> 04:15:21.462]  They want us off before this happens.
[04:15:21.622 --> 04:15:23.063]  And I think we're holding a timeline up.
[04:15:23.083 --> 04:15:25.204]  That's my gut with thousands of data points.
[04:15:25.644 --> 04:15:26.685]  I've learned my gut.
[04:15:26.885 --> 04:15:28.265]  It's not a guess.
[04:15:28.345 --> 04:15:30.346]  Your subconscious has all the data it's making it.
[04:15:31.067 --> 04:15:32.187]  This isn't about us, folks.
[04:15:32.227 --> 04:15:33.368]  This is about something big.
[04:15:33.388 --> 04:15:40.191]  So, Doc Chambers, 30 plus years, Green Beret, great patriot, hero for America, out there leading great events for America.
[04:15:41.311 --> 04:15:44.853]  What do you as an expert with your gestalt see in this analysis?
[04:15:45.313 --> 04:15:50.175]  Well, first of all, Alex, this is the Alamo of free speech right now, today.
[04:15:50.716 --> 04:15:51.736]  You are at Ground Central.
[04:15:52.356 --> 04:15:53.337]  We are at Ground Central.
[04:15:53.397 --> 04:15:54.077]  I didn't plan that.
[04:15:54.097 --> 04:15:54.977]  The guy's got a clip ready.
[04:15:55.037 --> 04:15:56.338]  Look at that.
[04:15:56.438 --> 04:15:56.778]  Alamo?
[04:15:57.279 --> 04:15:58.259]  Okay.
[04:15:58.359 --> 04:15:59.620]  Literally, did you tell the crew that?
[04:16:00.020 --> 04:16:02.221]  They just threw up an Alamo clip when you just said that.
[04:16:02.981 --> 04:16:03.782]  That's how God works.
[04:16:03.802 --> 04:16:04.662]  That's how God works.
[04:16:04.682 --> 04:16:05.402]  That's how God works.
[04:16:05.682 --> 04:16:07.663]  We do talk about God, by the way, on the side.
[04:16:07.883 --> 04:16:08.744]  Like, we're real about that.
[04:16:08.764 --> 04:16:09.684]  That's who syncs us up.
[04:16:09.804 --> 04:16:10.485]  That's the real GPS.
[04:16:10.505 --> 04:16:10.885]  That's right.
[04:16:11.567 --> 04:16:14.688]  That is the unity through the Holy Spirit.
[04:16:15.708 --> 04:16:21.930]  Through the 40,000-foot view of what we're looking at right now, if I was to overthrow a country, I would take out the lead speakers.
[04:16:21.970 --> 04:16:25.711]  I would take out the lead distributors of information to the public.
[04:16:25.771 --> 04:16:26.411]  That's what I would do.
[04:16:26.831 --> 04:16:27.652]  We can do it several ways.
[04:16:27.712 --> 04:16:29.392]  I can put a JDAM on top of something.
[04:16:29.412 --> 04:16:30.012]  I could blow it up.
[04:16:30.132 --> 04:16:30.732]  We're not going to do that.
[04:16:30.752 --> 04:16:31.473]  They're not going to do that.
[04:16:31.973 --> 04:16:39.375]  But with the deep state on their heels right now, the globalists on their heels right now, on their spurs, as we would say in Texas, they're on their spurs.
[04:16:40.075 --> 04:16:41.196]  And we've got to keep pushing.
[04:16:41.496 --> 04:16:48.519]  And you've pushed it so far that you've got an emergency stay, so to speak, tomorrow emergency hearing in Houston, correct?
[04:16:49.039 --> 04:16:50.979]  Yeah, they're calling to shut the company down tomorrow in front of the judge.
[04:16:51.480 --> 04:16:52.560]  And that was supposed to happen tonight.
[04:16:52.860 --> 04:16:53.400]  So I drove in.
[04:16:53.440 --> 04:16:54.641]  It was a 16-hour drive.
[04:16:55.521 --> 04:16:56.502]  And I was off the grid.
[04:16:56.862 --> 04:17:00.483]  And somebody said, Alex, he's on his spurs right now, but he's fighting.
[04:17:00.523 --> 04:17:02.024]  He's moving forward in the foxhole.
[04:17:02.444 --> 04:17:11.347]  So what we did, we came in, but when I look at everything that's happening, and we're talking about between the shot stuff, between the attack on food, you had Ted Nugent on here not too long ago.
[04:17:11.367 --> 04:17:12.047]  It's a full move.
[04:17:12.407 --> 04:17:17.209]  He and I were fighting people trying to kill the deer population in Texas two days ago up in Terrell, Texas.
[04:17:17.629 --> 04:17:24.731]  So, they're moving really quickly on all lines of effort against you, the public, Americans, the Republic of the United States.
[04:17:24.751 --> 04:17:26.172]  And real war is blowing up food and energy.
[04:17:26.252 --> 04:17:27.812]  For people that don't know, they're cutting it all off.
[04:17:27.892 --> 04:17:28.773]  It's getting cut off.
[04:17:28.853 --> 04:17:32.714]  You've had Michael Yan on here, he talked about energy from the North Stream Pipeline.
[04:17:32.734 --> 04:17:33.974]  Classic military action.
[04:17:34.134 --> 04:17:35.635]  Oh, this is multi-pronged.
[04:17:36.135 --> 04:17:42.217]  And so, when you see that, the only thing that I can say is because nobody's at the top that's claiming it.
[04:17:42.657 --> 04:17:44.678]  So this is run by Satan, alright?
[04:17:44.738 --> 04:17:45.198]  It's clandestine.
[04:17:47.030 --> 04:17:47.411]  Absolutely.
[04:17:48.692 --> 04:17:49.512]  But you made another point.
[04:17:49.592 --> 04:17:51.974]  They're not doing kinetic, this is unconventional.
[04:17:52.254 --> 04:17:53.295]  Unconventional warfare, absolutely.
[04:17:53.315 --> 04:17:58.139]  Which you would normally pay off and control the stations of the country you're about to go into.
[04:17:58.659 --> 04:18:00.341]  Operation Mockingbird, right?
[04:18:00.961 --> 04:18:02.582]  That is an actual thing.
[04:18:03.183 --> 04:18:08.347]  So when I can't do that, when I can't coerce you, when I can't leverage you, what was your lawsuit?
[04:18:08.387 --> 04:18:08.967]  In the billions?
[04:18:09.728 --> 04:18:10.849]  Yeah, which I never had any of that.
[04:18:10.909 --> 04:18:12.550]  But it was obscure people.
[04:18:14.730 --> 04:18:15.090]  Exactly.
[04:18:15.110 --> 04:18:17.672]  34 misdemeanors that turn into felonies for Trump.
[04:18:18.253 --> 04:18:18.433]  Right?
[04:18:18.513 --> 04:18:19.734]  That's how ridiculous this is.
[04:18:20.114 --> 04:18:20.994]  This is what they're doing to you.
[04:18:21.035 --> 04:18:21.955]  This is ridiculous.
[04:18:22.335 --> 04:18:30.341]  So, as crazy as it sounds, when we, in chaos, alright, here's a little rule of thumb in chaos.
[04:18:30.421 --> 04:18:31.742]  Green Berets, the Masters of Chaos.
[04:18:31.762 --> 04:18:32.463]  There's a book about it.
[04:18:33.203 --> 04:18:34.665]  Control the controllables.
[04:18:35.005 --> 04:18:38.129]  So what you do, masterfully, is you control the controllables.
[04:18:38.189 --> 04:18:40.192]  You take that 50 meter target, you take it down.
[04:18:40.432 --> 04:18:41.233]  You take down the 100 meter target.
[04:18:41.253 --> 04:18:42.775]  I was about to say, it's God, it's not me.
[04:18:43.095 --> 04:18:44.757]  The only control I have is exposing this.
[04:18:44.997 --> 04:18:45.318]  Correct.
[04:18:45.859 --> 04:18:47.280]  But God is... My only power is the people.
[04:18:47.601 --> 04:18:50.064]  Because you listen to the Holy Spirit, you know what to do next.
[04:18:50.584 --> 04:18:51.805]  That's called left-of-bang theory.
[04:18:51.845 --> 04:18:53.266]  That's before you hit the IED.
[04:18:53.786 --> 04:18:54.467]  That's what that is.
[04:18:54.567 --> 04:18:55.668]  That's what we pray for you.
[04:18:56.028 --> 04:18:57.289]  I have so many people right now hitting up.
[04:18:57.569 --> 04:18:59.070]  Tell Alex Jones we pray for him.
[04:18:59.390 --> 04:19:03.393]  Tell Alex Jones there are pipe hitters driving here from Lubbock, Texas right now.
[04:19:03.453 --> 04:19:04.173]  Vietnam vets.
[04:19:04.253 --> 04:19:08.616]  MACV SOG guys that were in the bush in Vietnam who are driving here right now.
[04:19:09.096 --> 04:19:14.720]  That's how important this is to us Americans that have been there and stood a post until we were properly relieved.
[04:19:15.000 --> 04:19:20.124]  Well, we haven't taken off our uniform yet and we still believe in the Constitution of the United States and took an oath to protect it.
[04:19:20.905 --> 04:19:22.186]  We didn't take an oath to a president.
[04:19:22.206 --> 04:19:24.109]  We didn't take an oath to an institution.
[04:19:24.129 --> 04:19:25.290]  I want to interrupt you and go back.
[04:19:25.450 --> 04:19:25.650]  Right.
[04:19:26.391 --> 04:19:27.393]  You were here an hour ago.
[04:19:27.493 --> 04:19:28.774]  I'm so distracted with no sleep.
[04:19:28.894 --> 04:19:29.675]  I forgot you're even here.
[04:19:29.695 --> 04:19:32.298]  And they go, hey, you're leaving Doc Chambers there when I wanted you on hours ago.
[04:19:32.919 --> 04:19:34.361]  I feel like a dick leaving you there.
[04:19:34.421 --> 04:19:34.802]  No, no, no.
[04:19:34.822 --> 04:19:35.342]  You're not mad.
[04:19:35.402 --> 04:19:35.943]  I know, I know.
[04:19:36.263 --> 04:19:37.044]  You walk in.
[04:19:37.064 --> 04:19:38.626]  They plug a microphone on.
[04:19:38.646 --> 04:19:39.447]  I'm getting tears in my eyes.
[04:19:40.328 --> 04:19:42.210]  And the crew is just in there queuing up videos.
[04:19:42.230 --> 04:19:44.612]  They haven't shown me at the Alamo in probably years.
[04:19:45.293 --> 04:19:46.834]  That video is like eight years old.
[04:19:47.274 --> 04:19:50.157]  No one was ever allowed to have a rally there, but then the conservative leaders did it.
[04:19:50.177 --> 04:19:51.258]  We had a rally down there for guns.
[04:19:51.738 --> 04:20:01.407]  They literally program it for the second you go on and you talk about the Alamo and the second you're saying it, they just randomly put it up.
[04:20:01.447 --> 04:20:01.967]  That's God.
[04:20:02.628 --> 04:20:04.569]  I mean, to go back to this, folks, that is insane.
[04:20:05.230 --> 04:20:06.930]  Because I know the promo videos and those on the computer.
[04:20:07.210 --> 04:20:09.111]  They literally, that's God, man.
[04:20:09.431 --> 04:20:11.592]  Like the minute you said the Alamo, they put it on screen.
[04:20:11.972 --> 04:20:14.832]  As you were saying, the second you said Alamo, it was on screen.
[04:20:14.892 --> 04:20:15.553]  That second.
[04:20:15.873 --> 04:20:17.213]  That's the Holy Spirit.
[04:20:17.533 --> 04:20:20.674]  And I know guys that have been in war, the guys that have survived, the guys that have been alive.
[04:20:20.694 --> 04:20:22.014]  They learn there's like an inner voice.
[04:20:22.454 --> 04:20:24.355]  That's why people in the military are actually Christian.
[04:20:24.375 --> 04:20:25.355]  They're not Satanist folks.
[04:20:25.595 --> 04:20:26.715]  Not the real people that survive.
[04:20:26.955 --> 04:20:28.116]  Because they learn it's the Holy Spirit.
[04:20:28.136 --> 04:20:28.916]  You want to tell people about that?
[04:20:29.316 --> 04:20:29.776]  Absolutely.
[04:20:30.716 --> 04:20:33.097]  There are no atheists in the foxhole.
[04:20:34.011 --> 04:20:42.055]  And I promise you this, that I had guys down range that I knew where they were because as a commander, I wanted to make sure I knew where they were going if something happened to them.
[04:20:42.495 --> 04:20:48.177]  Some of the biggest lessons I ever learned, and this kid on my wrist right here, Jeff Shaver, saved my life on the 12th of May, 2004.
[04:20:48.537 --> 04:20:59.462]  He would literally pray, do not be anxious about anything, but through everything, through prayer and petition, present your request to God and the peace of God that transcends all understanding will guard your heart and your mind in Christ Jesus.
[04:20:59.822 --> 04:21:00.863]  That's how this works.
[04:21:01.223 --> 04:21:02.864]  That is the fear of God.
[04:21:04.710 --> 04:21:06.372]  It transcends all understanding.
[04:21:06.752 --> 04:21:08.835]  And once you dive into it, it's like, what is this?
[04:21:09.195 --> 04:21:09.876]  Then you focus.
[04:21:09.916 --> 04:21:14.361]  So describe what it's like, though, when you literally get divine intel.
[04:21:14.582 --> 04:21:15.222]  What is that like?
[04:21:15.863 --> 04:21:16.504]  I experience it.
[04:21:16.524 --> 04:21:17.325]  People don't know what this is like.
[04:21:17.345 --> 04:21:19.027]  I don't know why the top soldiers survive.
[04:21:19.427 --> 04:21:20.528]  They only survive because of God.
[04:21:21.209 --> 04:21:21.669]  Absolutely.
[04:21:22.530 --> 04:21:25.512]  Well, sometimes we lose, we lose brothers too, but we know where they're going to be.
[04:21:26.272 --> 04:21:26.713]  Here's the deal.
[04:21:26.773 --> 04:21:31.396]  When you have that discernment and you can focus, look, I'm a guy that was a plumber on a battlefield.
[04:21:31.616 --> 04:21:32.396]  I stopped bleeding.
[04:21:32.436 --> 04:21:33.137]  That's what I did.
[04:21:33.597 --> 04:21:36.879]  The only way I could keep my hands from shaking to death was saying that prayer.
[04:21:36.939 --> 04:21:40.561]  The only way I could focus on it was to focus on the Holy Spirit and what he was saying to me at that moment.
[04:21:40.962 --> 04:21:42.383]  Sometimes rockets don't hit you.
[04:21:44.924 --> 04:21:46.005]  Sometimes they fly over you.
[04:21:46.265 --> 04:21:50.888]  My mom woke up in the middle of the night praying and saying, something bad happened last night, didn't it?
[04:21:50.908 --> 04:21:51.588]  I was in Baghdad in 2004.
[04:21:51.828 --> 04:21:53.830]  I said, no ma'am, nothing bad happened.
[04:21:53.850 --> 04:21:54.750]  But I knew what happened.
[04:21:55.150 --> 04:21:57.372]  An RPG hit a wall and it didn't hit my truck.
[04:21:57.912 --> 04:22:00.074]  But my mom was praying at that same time.
[04:22:00.354 --> 04:22:01.314]  These are real things.
[04:22:01.735 --> 04:22:08.439]  This is not me doing some kind of crazy, you know, Christian stuff because I'm trying to win you over to the Lord.
[04:22:08.459 --> 04:22:08.799]  You've seen it!
[04:22:08.819 --> 04:22:09.960]  I am trying to win you over to the Lord.
[04:22:09.980 --> 04:22:10.360]  You've seen it!
[04:22:11.684 --> 04:22:12.244]  Testimony.
[04:22:12.584 --> 04:22:13.865]  Testimony is so important.
[04:22:13.905 --> 04:22:15.125]  That is my story.
[04:22:15.145 --> 04:22:16.025]  That is his story.
[04:22:16.065 --> 04:22:17.005]  These are testimonies.
[04:22:17.025 --> 04:22:17.785]  These are real things.
[04:22:18.086 --> 04:22:19.386]  We're standing in the gap right now.
[04:22:19.966 --> 04:22:25.907]  God literally told me Friday, just off the guard and the way he looked conflicted, I went, they're shutting the company down.
[04:22:25.947 --> 04:22:26.508]  And I bluffed him.
[04:22:26.548 --> 04:22:28.008]  I said, so you got guards coming out?
[04:22:28.028 --> 04:22:28.388]  What's going on?
[04:22:28.428 --> 04:22:29.128]  Well, yeah.
[04:22:29.528 --> 04:22:30.829]  I mean, it was literally, it was not me.
[04:22:30.969 --> 04:22:31.989]  This is powerful.
[04:22:32.662 --> 04:22:34.084]  Right, it is extremely powerful.
[04:22:34.665 --> 04:22:44.400]  How would it be that I would be 16 hours away and then all of a sudden we come in here at exactly the time when we thought I was going to come in an hour ago, the Alamo would pop up?
[04:22:45.141 --> 04:22:45.582]  It's crazy.
[04:22:46.889 --> 04:22:49.130]  William Barrett Travis, 24 February 1836.
[04:22:49.470 --> 04:22:51.171]  The Travis Letter.
[04:22:51.631 --> 04:22:54.652]  He says, fellow citizen compatriots, we are besieged on all sides.
[04:22:55.033 --> 04:22:59.054]  But this time it's under, it's Principalities Rules of Darkness.
[04:22:59.354 --> 04:23:00.555]  We're besieged on all sides.
[04:23:00.835 --> 04:23:04.457]  And then he goes on to say, come to our aid with all dispatch.
[04:23:04.497 --> 04:23:09.099]  Americans, fellow citizen compatriots, Americans, come to our aid with all dispatch.
[04:23:09.359 --> 04:23:11.200]  Get up off the couch and do what you can do.
[04:23:11.540 --> 04:23:13.041]  People say to me, well, what can I do?
[04:23:13.321 --> 04:23:13.901]  You can pray.
[04:23:14.481 --> 04:23:15.942]  The power of corporate prayer?
[04:23:17.179 --> 04:23:17.659]  It's powerful.
[04:23:18.220 --> 04:23:19.180]  Well, what does the Bible say?
[04:23:19.240 --> 04:23:21.281]  Two people agreeing upon something is done in heaven.
[04:23:21.301 --> 04:23:22.722]  Christ is in our midst right now.
[04:23:23.642 --> 04:23:24.483]  We are protected by him.
[04:23:24.503 --> 04:23:28.425]  So moving on from me, because I'm literally not trying to act cool and say it's not about me.
[04:23:28.985 --> 04:23:29.786]  I'm not stupid.
[04:23:29.826 --> 04:23:30.686]  I'm not that important.
[04:23:31.006 --> 04:23:32.787]  I'm just the next target list.
[04:23:33.027 --> 04:23:34.428]  You agree with me when we talked before we went live.
[04:23:34.568 --> 04:23:36.149]  This means big stuff's going down.
[04:23:36.529 --> 04:23:38.490]  This panic, insane.
[04:23:40.131 --> 04:23:41.252]  What do you think the enemy's going to do?
[04:23:42.062 --> 04:23:45.963]  I think right now they're taking things down from the top as far as the numbers.
[04:23:46.083 --> 04:23:46.664]  What do you have?
[04:23:46.984 --> 04:23:50.885]  You came off of X and you're back on X. You got $2.5 million back pretty quickly.
[04:23:51.305 --> 04:23:52.746]  Yeah, I don't want to exaggerate.
[04:23:53.266 --> 04:23:58.248]  We're reaching, we're not at our peak from 2006-2007 of $35 million a day that actually listen to the show.
[04:23:58.268 --> 04:24:04.430]  At least 15 minutes, but we're back to about $20 million a day listening to the full part
[04:24:05.566 --> 04:24:06.448]  Another 20 million.
[04:24:06.488 --> 04:24:07.610]  We're at 40 million right now.
[04:24:07.650 --> 04:24:11.156]  So we're right back and they're in full shit their pants smothered right now.
[04:24:11.336 --> 04:24:14.842]  Okay, so you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free.
[04:24:14.882 --> 04:24:16.505]  That scares the hell out of the enemy.
[04:24:16.986 --> 04:24:18.208]  That scares the hell out of the enemy.
[04:24:18.581 --> 04:24:19.581]  And they should be scared.
[04:24:19.601 --> 04:24:21.942]  They should be on their spurs and they should be running for the hills.
[04:24:22.323 --> 04:24:25.104]  Because Trump comes in or not, God still wins.
[04:24:25.404 --> 04:24:26.444]  And that's what's so dumb.
[04:24:27.205 --> 04:24:29.346]  Attacking us just made us reach even more.
[04:24:29.366 --> 04:24:31.707]  Like this, it's weird.
[04:24:31.727 --> 04:24:34.508]  They're like, they're really smart in ways, but they're not smart in others.
[04:24:34.528 --> 04:24:35.028]  It's weird.
[04:24:35.328 --> 04:24:35.548]  Oh yeah.
[04:24:36.049 --> 04:24:38.230]  Well, it's demonic, okay?
[04:24:38.270 --> 04:24:39.890]  The demonic control that's over all this.
[04:24:41.011 --> 04:24:45.393]  You know, I wouldn't be surprised if in the middle of this conversation, they don't try to shut it down.
[04:24:46.291 --> 04:24:47.151]  Because that's how they work.
[04:24:47.431 --> 04:24:49.692]  We had them last night, killing the feet on X. Rog.
[04:24:50.112 --> 04:24:52.993]  Yeah, I mean, that kind of stuff is just happening more and more.
[04:24:53.014 --> 04:24:57.895]  So, moving on from us, I want to thank the listeners and all the support and thank you for coming here.
[04:24:59.556 --> 04:25:00.636]  The security firm's not bad.
[04:25:00.656 --> 04:25:02.857]  They were just told to do this and shut us down, so they're good people.
[04:25:02.877 --> 04:25:03.577]  They're not bad guys.
[04:25:03.978 --> 04:25:05.278]  They've been here for a while.
[04:25:05.298 --> 04:25:05.798]  They're listeners.
[04:25:05.818 --> 04:25:06.499]  They're all great men.
[04:25:06.519 --> 04:25:07.579]  They're all military guys.
[04:25:09.280 --> 04:25:15.562]  Moving on from us, though, and it is important what's happened to us as an example to others, but larger picture, Colonel,
[04:25:16.869 --> 04:25:23.871]  What can we do right now, obviously get close to God, but what else can we do politically to realize the situation we're in?
[04:25:23.891 --> 04:25:24.651]  I think I kind of said it.
[04:25:24.671 --> 04:25:29.252]  I mean, realize we're in the attempt for total takeover right now.
[04:25:29.472 --> 04:25:29.652]  Right.
[04:25:29.872 --> 04:25:33.273]  And we have to recognize that we're in a war to then defeat it.
[04:25:33.313 --> 04:25:35.173]  We have the tools to defeat it, but how do we defeat it?
[04:25:35.893 --> 04:25:36.413]  Politically.
[04:25:36.934 --> 04:25:38.654]  You're saying, what can we do politically?
[04:25:40.649 --> 04:25:42.710]  I hate to be, I'm a glasses half full guy.
[04:25:43.291 --> 04:25:48.854]  I don't have a lot of faith in anybody north of the Potomac right now, in D.C.
[04:25:48.934 --> 04:25:49.975]  I don't have a lot of faith.
[04:25:51.036 --> 04:25:52.957]  I do know that there is hope for everyone.
[04:25:53.277 --> 04:26:00.962]  And I do know that, pray that the Holy Spirit or angels torment them until they turn from their evil ways.
[04:26:03.370 --> 04:26:04.030]  It's all Tarsus.
[04:26:04.491 --> 04:26:04.931]  Absolutely.
[04:26:05.171 --> 04:26:05.491]  Been there.
[04:26:05.511 --> 04:26:06.192]  It's a great place.
[04:26:06.652 --> 04:26:08.733]  It's where Paul was from.
[04:26:09.114 --> 04:26:10.635]  But Paul was part of the Roman Empire.
[04:26:11.095 --> 04:26:13.496]  And he was the only one that can go to the Romans and speak to them.
[04:26:13.997 --> 04:26:20.681]  We are, right now, we're speaking to those Americans out there that, like us, have seen what's going on and need to get involved.
[04:26:20.721 --> 04:26:22.202]  So, what can we do locally?
[04:26:22.922 --> 04:26:24.463]  Locally, we gotta focus there.
[04:26:24.703 --> 04:26:25.823]  I know that General Flynn says that.
[04:26:25.843 --> 04:26:27.263]  I was just speaking with him up in Dallas.
[04:26:28.064 --> 04:26:31.045]  Act locally, and it'll move up to the higher levels.
[04:26:31.085 --> 04:26:32.325]  But right now, that's where we gotta be.
[04:26:32.365 --> 04:26:33.365]  So that's what I'm trying to say.
[04:26:33.885 --> 04:26:35.686]  It's not about me, or you, or Trump.
[04:26:36.086 --> 04:26:37.006]  We're just focal points.
[04:26:37.146 --> 04:26:39.467]  The people have to understand the agency they have.
[04:26:40.647 --> 04:26:42.068]  Agency and the authority they have.
[04:26:43.585 --> 04:26:46.087]  Go out and preach to the nations, the great commission.
[04:26:46.427 --> 04:26:49.050]  It says under the authorities of heaven first.
[04:26:49.370 --> 04:26:49.891]  Authorities.
[04:26:50.291 --> 04:26:53.935]  As a guy that's a warrior, I have to ask for authorities.
[04:26:53.995 --> 04:26:54.856]  I can't just go and do.
[04:26:55.276 --> 04:26:56.777]  Advise, assist, and accompany.
[04:26:57.218 --> 04:26:57.979]  We can advise.
[04:26:57.999 --> 04:26:59.720]  That was incredible when you asked God.
[04:27:01.702 --> 04:27:05.526]  He doesn't even give you big jobs up front, in my experience.
[04:27:05.966 --> 04:27:07.928]  God gives you little tasks to see if you'll do it.
[04:27:08.249 --> 04:27:08.929]  It's all free will.
[04:27:09.009 --> 04:27:10.010]  It gets bigger and bigger.
[04:27:10.050 --> 04:27:12.673]  And all of a sudden, God's literally telling you what to do.
[04:27:12.733 --> 04:27:13.494]  It's insane.
[04:27:13.554 --> 04:27:13.974]  It's wild.
[04:27:14.134 --> 04:27:15.075]  It's in the book of Luke.
[04:27:15.135 --> 04:27:16.356]  And Luke is a doctor, by the way.
[04:27:16.376 --> 04:27:20.020]  And so Luke says, be faithful and a little, and he'll give you more.
[04:27:20.060 --> 04:27:20.861]  Now I'm paraphrasing it.
[04:27:21.261 --> 04:27:22.321]  I don't have them all memorized.
[04:27:22.561 --> 04:27:23.221]  No, look at the camera.
[04:27:23.261 --> 04:27:23.481]  Tell them.
[04:27:23.502 --> 04:27:23.782]  That's it.
[04:27:24.202 --> 04:27:28.903]  So Luke, in the book of Luke it says, be faithful in a little and he will give you more.
[04:27:29.303 --> 04:27:30.363]  You're faithful in a little?
[04:27:30.483 --> 04:27:31.323]  You're faithful in a lot.
[04:27:31.423 --> 04:27:32.663]  I mean, from my point of view.
[04:27:32.983 --> 04:27:41.205]  But when I started to learn to be that way, when I got fired from the border and I didn't have a job, and I was out there trying to figure out what to do on my horse and trying to help ranchers, I was faithful in a little.
[04:27:41.545 --> 04:27:42.185]  And then what happened?
[04:27:42.525 --> 04:27:47.246]  I got a group of pipe hitters together and now we are probably the biggest group in Texas that is a do tank.
[04:27:47.547 --> 04:27:47.907]  Do tank.
[04:27:47.987 --> 04:27:48.687]  Not a think tank.
[04:27:48.927 --> 04:27:49.567]  We do stuff.
[04:27:50.107 --> 04:27:53.529]  But we do God's work, and that's because we were faithful in a little.
[04:27:54.050 --> 04:27:57.131]  We might have been eating pork and beans at the time, every once in a while I'd get a ribeye.
[04:27:58.232 --> 04:28:03.995]  That's the thing, God wants us to suffer because it makes us stronger.
[04:28:04.276 --> 04:28:05.476]  The wilderness makes you stronger.
[04:28:05.696 --> 04:28:08.058]  That's what Nietzsche said, that which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.
[04:28:08.078 --> 04:28:08.678]  That's it.
[04:28:09.118 --> 04:28:11.200]  So in that wilderness, we all go through a wilderness.
[04:28:11.340 --> 04:28:12.941]  We've been through wildernesses in our lives.
[04:28:13.686 --> 04:28:16.689]  But in those wildernesses, we learn to sharpen that sword.
[04:28:16.989 --> 04:28:19.932]  And together, so one man will sharpen the other.
[04:28:20.412 --> 04:28:22.815]  Iron sharpens iron, so will one man another.
[04:28:23.295 --> 04:28:30.562]  I didn't know you for so many years, but I got to know you the first time that I was allowed to come in here with my dog and talk about the shots on the border with the troops.
[04:28:31.142 --> 04:28:36.225]  But from that, we figured out that we sharpen each other, and it's only occasional, but that's okay.
[04:28:36.345 --> 04:28:39.367]  Because when the Holy Spirit tells me, hey, send this to Alex, I send it.
[04:28:39.687 --> 04:28:40.648]  It may help you, it may not.
[04:28:41.048 --> 04:28:42.269]  It's all about being obedient.
[04:28:42.349 --> 04:28:44.290]  Everything you send me is right.
[04:28:44.530 --> 04:28:45.331]  Here's the deal.
[04:28:45.931 --> 04:28:48.012]  It's obedience over sacrifice.
[04:28:48.412 --> 04:28:50.173]  Obedience over sacrifice.
[04:28:50.313 --> 04:28:51.354]  Obedience sometimes sucks.
[04:28:51.414 --> 04:28:52.315]  It comes with a cost.
[04:28:53.035 --> 04:28:54.876]  Telling the truth to the D.O.D.
[04:28:54.896 --> 04:28:56.396]  when you get the full weight of the D.O.D.
[04:28:56.436 --> 04:28:59.638]  on your back, and then they start telling you, Doc, you need to get... Let's head on.
[04:29:00.358 --> 04:29:01.398]  God gives me an order.
[04:29:01.999 --> 04:29:04.159]  The obedience, the sacrifice doesn't even matter.
[04:29:04.520 --> 04:29:05.700]  Like, I already followed the order.
[04:29:06.240 --> 04:29:06.400]  Right.
[04:29:06.781 --> 04:29:10.902]  I just look at Job, though, and others that lose everything.
[04:29:11.142 --> 04:29:12.103]  It's the opposite with me.
[04:29:12.143 --> 04:29:14.083]  God's been so nice to me, and I get scared.
[04:29:14.103 --> 04:29:15.404]  I go, God, I'm a pussy.
[04:29:15.484 --> 04:29:17.325]  Please don't do what you did to Job.
[04:29:17.345 --> 04:29:18.625]  Don't take my wife and kids.
[04:29:19.105 --> 04:29:20.306]  God has been...
[04:29:20.886 --> 04:29:21.747]  God knows I'm a pussy.
[04:29:22.007 --> 04:29:23.788]  I mean, I'm tough, but I'm a pussy compared to Job.
[04:29:24.408 --> 04:29:27.910]  I literally... I get attacked and date the next day!
[04:29:27.930 --> 04:29:29.191]  I blast everybody!
[04:29:29.491 --> 04:29:30.032]  God is like...
[04:29:31.554 --> 04:29:32.915]  I realize this is I'm a pussy.
[04:29:33.355 --> 04:29:35.976]  I mean, God has like, I don't know how to explain this.
[04:29:36.096 --> 04:29:36.737]  It's crazy.
[04:29:36.797 --> 04:29:39.798]  Like, it's like the attack comes, the victory comes.
[04:29:39.898 --> 04:29:42.879]  It's like, it's like, like now I love the attacks.
[04:29:43.200 --> 04:29:44.400]  I'm not, I was never a sadist.
[04:29:45.201 --> 04:29:45.881]  I don't like pain.
[04:29:45.921 --> 04:29:47.342]  I don't want to take pain.
[04:29:47.362 --> 04:29:47.822]  I'll do it.
[04:29:48.262 --> 04:29:54.445]  But I like now, every time I get attacked and really hurt, I go, God, and the next day God delivers.
[04:29:54.565 --> 04:29:56.406]  I'm like, why am I so blessed?
[04:29:56.986 --> 04:29:59.148]  Because you're in the arena, my friend.
[04:29:59.588 --> 04:30:01.529]  And when you're in the arena, you get attacked.
[04:30:02.530 --> 04:30:06.913]  But I don't get why I get immediate, immediate power.
[04:30:06.954 --> 04:30:10.756]  I get why you do, because whether or not you ever wore a uniform or not, you're a warrior.
[04:30:10.997 --> 04:30:12.338]  And a warrior looks for the fight.
[04:30:13.258 --> 04:30:13.839]  That's what you do.
[04:30:13.879 --> 04:30:14.599]  You look for the fight.
[04:30:14.619 --> 04:30:15.340]  God hates cowards.
[04:30:16.826 --> 04:30:17.347]  Revelation 20, 21, 8.
[04:30:17.928 --> 04:30:22.214]  There are several things that God lists in 21, 8 in Revelation.
[04:30:22.234 --> 04:30:22.574]  Look it up.
[04:30:23.215 --> 04:30:23.796]  Several things.
[04:30:24.637 --> 04:30:26.700]  Idolaters, sexually immoral, all those things.
[04:30:27.020 --> 04:30:27.601]  Number one.
[04:30:27.741 --> 04:30:28.262]  Number one in 21, 8.
[04:30:29.263 --> 04:30:29.644]  Cowards.
[04:30:30.485 --> 04:30:32.228]  Moral or physical cowardice.
[04:30:32.668 --> 04:30:38.152]  Yeah, I only tell that story because I read Job going through all this hell and I'm like, God, please don't test me like Job.
[04:30:38.172 --> 04:30:39.473]  And it's, it's bad.
[04:30:39.533 --> 04:30:40.193]  It's horrible.
[04:30:40.313 --> 04:30:40.894]  It's terrible.
[04:30:40.994 --> 04:30:41.754]  It's not nice.
[04:30:42.154 --> 04:30:45.076]  But it's like, God, the next day delivers me.
[04:30:45.577 --> 04:30:47.358]  And I just go like, I am so lucky.
[04:30:47.458 --> 04:30:48.999]  Like this is, but I get that.
[04:30:49.019 --> 04:30:50.740]  It's because I am, I don't care.
[04:30:50.760 --> 04:30:52.301]  I don't even have fear.
[04:30:52.621 --> 04:30:53.342]  I have fear of failure.
[04:30:53.362 --> 04:30:54.162]  I don't know how to explain that.
[04:30:54.222 --> 04:30:55.824]  Like, I have no fear of the enemy.
[04:30:56.104 --> 04:30:57.144]  Kill my kids, kill me.
[04:30:57.164 --> 04:30:58.305]  They're going to kill them anyways.
[04:30:58.725 --> 04:31:02.368]  But I am in fear of not submitting to God.
[04:31:03.830 --> 04:31:06.396]  Fear of the Lord is the beginning of understanding, of wisdom.
[04:31:07.357 --> 04:31:08.159]  That's the beginning of it.
[04:31:08.480 --> 04:31:11.946]  That's why when you go through Proverbs, which is the book about wisdom,
[04:31:13.025 --> 04:31:15.346]  When I sent you a proverb, I sent 35 the other day.
[04:31:15.366 --> 04:31:16.786]  Yeah, you sent to me all 35.
[04:31:17.086 --> 04:31:17.246]  Yeah.
[04:31:17.786 --> 04:31:24.508]  So when you, when you, when you, the beginning, the fear of the Lord, healthy fear, not like you're going to get your blow.
[04:31:24.548 --> 04:31:25.488]  You're in God's presence.
[04:31:25.608 --> 04:31:27.229]  It's, it's, you get on your face.
[04:31:27.329 --> 04:31:28.369]  You get on your face.
[04:31:28.489 --> 04:31:29.049]  Describe that.
[04:31:29.249 --> 04:31:29.989]  I know you're with God.
[04:31:30.249 --> 04:31:31.450]  What is it like?
[04:31:31.490 --> 04:31:32.150]  I'll give an example.
[04:31:32.170 --> 04:31:34.010]  Have you been there when God really comes in the room?
[04:31:34.270 --> 04:31:34.430]  Yeah.
[04:31:34.770 --> 04:31:34.910]  Yeah.
[04:31:35.331 --> 04:31:40.892]  When I did a ruck not too long ago, I was ruck marching with my dog, came back into Dripping Springs, went into the one shot there.
[04:31:41.383 --> 04:31:45.724]  And literally, I heard three times, the power of the Lord is upon you.
[04:31:45.905 --> 04:31:46.385]  Three times.
[04:31:46.405 --> 04:31:48.705]  I was on my face in the parking lot.
[04:31:48.866 --> 04:31:49.206]  Me too, yeah.
[04:31:49.306 --> 04:31:59.049]  Because it comes over you, and it takes you over, and it tells you, I love you son, and I'm going to protect you, and I'm going to send warring angels over you.
[04:32:00.069 --> 04:32:05.973]  But you will still feel the power of the Lord and the fear of God, which is a healthy fear.
[04:32:06.013 --> 04:32:07.874]  This is not like a fear of the enemy.
[04:32:08.355 --> 04:32:09.175]  What's the enemy going to do to you?
[04:32:09.195 --> 04:32:09.956]  It's the awesomeness!
[04:32:10.036 --> 04:32:10.716]  It's the awesomeness.
[04:32:10.936 --> 04:32:11.197]  That's it.
[04:32:11.617 --> 04:32:21.744]  So describe that because that's what happened to me when I've had a few of these like vision events where I'm given the whole blueprint and I can't, I was in a restaurant the first time it happened like 27 years ago and they're like, are you okay?
[04:32:21.764 --> 04:32:27.868]  And I was like laying on the table because the power was so powerful I couldn't help but lay on the table.
[04:32:28.368 --> 04:32:31.132]  Well, that is Second Chronicle 714.
[04:32:31.193 --> 04:32:34.818]  I'm going to use the Army version of it.
[04:32:34.838 --> 04:32:40.226]  Take a knee, face out, pull security, but take a knee, humble yourself.
[04:32:40.787 --> 04:32:41.508]  Humble yourself.
[04:32:42.557 --> 04:32:45.099]  And then look to me, and I will heal your land.
[04:32:45.119 --> 04:32:46.961]  But why does it blast you like that?
[04:32:47.101 --> 04:32:53.126]  It's like... Because it is the power of the Lord coming through the Holy Spirit, which is completely can overtake your body.
[04:32:53.147 --> 04:32:54.207]  And your cells get it.
[04:32:54.288 --> 04:32:56.149]  They're like... It's a harmonic.
[04:32:56.229 --> 04:32:57.370]  It's a vibration.
[04:32:57.911 --> 04:32:58.671]  Your cells get it.
[04:32:59.704 --> 04:33:00.884]  They're like, this is the boss.
[04:33:01.105 --> 04:33:01.765]  This is the boss.
[04:33:02.045 --> 04:33:03.806]  And that's why we are so in awe of him.
[04:33:04.166 --> 04:33:05.887]  And when you are like that, you're right.
[04:33:06.347 --> 04:33:06.807]  You're right.
[04:33:07.687 --> 04:33:08.548]  And it doesn't matter.
[04:33:08.848 --> 04:33:10.248]  You say right, that's the perfect word.
[04:33:10.288 --> 04:33:11.289]  I was calling completion.
[04:33:11.709 --> 04:33:17.611]  When the Holy Spirit fully, because new Christians get the comforter, it's like a baby and you feel good, you cry.
[04:33:17.631 --> 04:33:19.912]  And I'm crying right now because I feel the Holy Spirit.
[04:33:20.252 --> 04:33:24.734]  But when God really comes in with a mission for you, it's like, boom, you're on the ground.
[04:33:24.814 --> 04:33:26.295]  It's like, bam!
[04:33:26.475 --> 04:33:27.695]  You are hammered down.
[04:33:27.816 --> 04:33:28.496]  As we should be.
[04:33:29.116 --> 04:33:30.416]  As it should be.
[04:33:30.516 --> 04:33:34.817]  And it's hard to explain until you've been there, until you've seen it, until you know.
[04:33:35.057 --> 04:33:36.778]  And I want other people, that's my thing.
[04:33:37.458 --> 04:33:38.458]  I want them to know this.
[04:33:38.598 --> 04:33:40.259]  Imagine if we get everybody to know this.
[04:33:40.379 --> 04:33:41.699]  It's going out right now, my friend.
[04:33:42.079 --> 04:33:47.940]  And the thing that is amazing about it is that there is nothing more powerful than that.
[04:33:48.400 --> 04:33:54.502]  Any army, an angel could destroy every army in the world, one, through the direction of God, one.
[04:33:55.287 --> 04:33:56.888]  When you have a legion behind you.
[04:33:56.908 --> 04:33:58.108]  Literally everybody just burns up.
[04:33:58.368 --> 04:34:00.829]  One second, you're dead.
[04:34:01.069 --> 04:34:09.473]  And it will seem to the non-believer, any non-believers out there, and it says it in the book, you may not have read this part, it'll seem as foolishness.
[04:34:11.638 --> 04:34:12.759]  Okay, well, every knee will bow.
[04:34:13.540 --> 04:34:15.142]  And at that point, you have to make a decision.
[04:34:15.182 --> 04:34:15.982]  Was that foolishness?
[04:34:16.583 --> 04:34:19.426]  Because you might end up in that 21-8, Revelation 21.
[04:34:19.486 --> 04:34:20.086]  Well, that's it.
[04:34:20.187 --> 04:34:21.728]  It's a fire and brimstone.
[04:34:21.788 --> 04:34:24.110]  If you're with God, you kneel immediately.
[04:34:24.511 --> 04:34:26.533]  And they think it's a foolishness right before they get flamethrowed.
[04:34:27.714 --> 04:34:28.535]  Fire and brimstone.
[04:34:28.555 --> 04:34:28.835]  21-8.
[04:34:29.115 --> 04:34:29.736]  That's what it says.
[04:34:29.756 --> 04:34:31.938]  You'll end up in a lake of fire and brimstone.
[04:34:32.199 --> 04:34:34.501]  Choose not that choice.
[04:34:36.152 --> 04:34:37.832]  So, tell me about yourself.
[04:34:37.852 --> 04:34:38.573]  You're a really interesting guy.
[04:34:38.593 --> 04:34:40.493]  I want to talk about the world, but people are interesting.
[04:34:40.953 --> 04:34:41.793]  Tell me about your life.
[04:34:42.153 --> 04:34:43.113]  You were always a Christian.
[04:34:43.414 --> 04:34:44.134]  When did it happen?
[04:34:44.154 --> 04:34:45.554]  When did you like get dialed into this?
[04:34:46.394 --> 04:34:53.596]  The thing that kept me out of going to church from the time I left for the Army in 1983 under Ronald Reagan was the pulpit.
[04:34:54.096 --> 04:34:57.216]  It was the pulpit where weak, because they were weak men that were in there.
[04:34:57.256 --> 04:34:58.957]  Not all of them, but at the time.
[04:34:59.057 --> 04:35:00.357]  And they try to pose as God.
[04:35:00.417 --> 04:35:00.937]  It's a joke.
[04:35:00.997 --> 04:35:02.097]  You see, this is not a good person.
[04:35:02.257 --> 04:35:04.258]  And especially nowadays where you have these effeminate
[04:35:04.938 --> 04:35:09.140]  Pastors and preachers that are just skinny jeans guys that are soy drinkers.
[04:35:09.741 --> 04:35:10.421]  And you see it.
[04:35:10.501 --> 04:35:11.462]  That's not God.
[04:35:11.502 --> 04:35:15.524]  As Christ said, don't listen to the Pharisees that pray up on the mountain, pray at 3 a.m.
[04:35:15.584 --> 04:35:16.684]  These are not your leaders.
[04:35:17.004 --> 04:35:18.105]  Judgment is not for me.
[04:35:18.205 --> 04:35:19.926]  It's only to look at the fruits of the Spirit.
[04:35:20.106 --> 04:35:22.828]  Peace, joy, love, hope, you know, self-control.
[04:35:23.568 --> 04:35:24.709]  These are fruits of the Spirit.
[04:35:24.749 --> 04:35:28.831]  When you're walking and you have those, those are the things that exude off of you.
[04:35:29.491 --> 04:35:30.632]  Okay, those things come off you.
[04:35:30.732 --> 04:35:31.553]  Peace, right?
[04:35:31.673 --> 04:35:33.135]  Sometimes we have peace, sometimes we don't.
[04:35:33.615 --> 04:35:34.636]  Sometimes we have self-control.
[04:35:34.656 --> 04:35:36.077]  Well, but you're in peace with what you're doing.
[04:35:36.178 --> 04:35:36.938]  With what you're doing.
[04:35:37.038 --> 04:35:39.461]  With the way that you are taking God's Word to you.
[04:35:39.481 --> 04:35:43.024]  It's very easy if you're in a war to kill somebody if you're in peace.
[04:35:43.304 --> 04:35:43.485]  Right.
[04:35:43.585 --> 04:35:43.965]  Roger that.
[04:35:44.085 --> 04:35:44.265]  Yeah.
[04:35:44.446 --> 04:35:45.647]  At war, they call that peace.
[04:35:45.727 --> 04:35:47.909]  I'm just saying, like, you're very calm when you do it.
[04:35:48.389 --> 04:35:51.372]  Well, somebody that's tactically mature will do that.
[04:35:51.713 --> 04:35:52.473]  But when you're a kid?
[04:35:53.354 --> 04:35:53.955]  You know, it's tough.
[04:35:54.275 --> 04:35:58.119]  Because when you're a kid, you're scared to death, and then you sometimes lash out out of anger.
[04:35:58.679 --> 04:36:04.846]  It's said it's very focused and... Tactically mature operators will be very business-oriented.
[04:36:05.947 --> 04:36:08.589]  It's servicing a bad guy, not killing a bad guy.
[04:36:11.272 --> 04:36:11.712]  Keep going.
[04:36:11.792 --> 04:36:24.816]  Yeah, so then 30 years I did Army stuff and I was out and in and then I became a doctor along the way and a Green Beret along the way and then I walked into a church in Beaumont, Texas down there by Port Arthur and a guy named Paul Vick.
[04:36:25.236 --> 04:36:26.417]  If you're listening, Paul, love you.
[04:36:26.817 --> 04:36:29.998]  He's currently with the penal system as a pastor there, a chaplain.
[04:36:30.518 --> 04:36:33.641]  But man is big as a house, and he preached the gospel, and I listened to it.
[04:36:33.961 --> 04:36:42.308]  And the first time I listened to it, the power of the Lord came upon me, and I was prostate on the floor in front of that little church, Marian Baptist Church in Port Arthur, Texas.
[04:36:42.808 --> 04:36:44.229]  And I just said, this is it.
[04:36:44.670 --> 04:36:47.492]  But the fruits of the Spirit took a long time to come along.
[04:36:47.512 --> 04:36:47.932]  I'm almost 60.
[04:36:48.533 --> 04:36:49.073]  December I'll be 60.
[04:36:49.874 --> 04:36:54.097]  And it's taken 30 years to finally get to where I can figure out
[04:36:54.958 --> 04:36:57.239]  How to listen, how to have eyes to see.
[04:36:57.319 --> 04:36:57.839]  Oh, me too.
[04:36:57.899 --> 04:37:00.660]  It's incredible to tune into it because it's so big.
[04:37:01.000 --> 04:37:02.040]  First, it knocks you on the ground.
[04:37:02.080 --> 04:37:03.361]  Now you got to learn how to tune into this.
[04:37:03.601 --> 04:37:03.761]  Right.
[04:37:04.081 --> 04:37:06.302]  And so it's God's timing.
[04:37:06.342 --> 04:37:08.243]  OK, there's three things we've got to pay attention to.
[04:37:08.603 --> 04:37:10.923]  Number one, are you do you know the Lord?
[04:37:11.083 --> 04:37:12.024]  Do you know your Lord?
[04:37:12.204 --> 04:37:13.444]  OK, you have fear of the Lord.
[04:37:13.484 --> 04:37:13.824]  You do.
[04:37:14.004 --> 04:37:14.925]  So you know the Lord.
[04:37:15.345 --> 04:37:15.585]  OK.
[04:37:16.165 --> 04:37:18.486]  Number two, what authorities do you walk in?
[04:37:18.546 --> 04:37:22.767]  You have a lot of authorities and that's and there's also a higher calling on you.
[04:37:22.927 --> 04:37:24.168]  But with that comes a cost.
[04:37:24.588 --> 04:37:27.690]  No, it's that God gives you power and now you've got a responsibility.
[04:37:27.710 --> 04:37:28.751]  That's right, you've got a responsibility.
[04:37:28.791 --> 04:37:31.093]  So you're judged, as the scriptures say, stricter.
[04:37:31.673 --> 04:37:32.113]  Stricter.
[04:37:32.513 --> 04:37:34.715]  Because you have an audience and they're listening to you.
[04:37:35.115 --> 04:37:47.644]  And if somebody goes astray because of me, who I'm now in a ministry, I'm the remnant 18 ministry, if I say something when I speak at a church and it's wrong, or I do it out of different... With great power is great responsibility.
[04:37:47.724 --> 04:37:48.204]  Absolutely.
[04:37:48.684 --> 04:37:49.065]  Absolutely.
[04:37:49.665 --> 04:37:54.450]  And then number three is, are you humble?
[04:37:55.051 --> 04:37:55.751]  Can you be humbled?
[04:37:56.272 --> 04:37:59.455]  Because if you're not and you're full of yourself, you're full of you-know-what.
[04:38:00.056 --> 04:38:00.856]  I've done good on that.
[04:38:00.957 --> 04:38:02.218]  I get so humble now.
[04:38:02.238 --> 04:38:04.220]  I mean, I'm completely humble.
[04:38:05.481 --> 04:38:12.564]  So you walk in those things, and you see that, and you know that now you're in the right place, and it's what we call an Esther moment.
[04:38:12.864 --> 04:38:13.704]  Okay, I call it that.
[04:38:14.084 --> 04:38:15.885]  In the book of Esther, she was for that moment.
[04:38:15.925 --> 04:38:18.346]  She was there for the moment such as this.
[04:38:19.086 --> 04:38:20.547]  So why did it take me 30 years?
[04:38:20.767 --> 04:38:21.847]  Because it's God's timing.
[04:38:22.228 --> 04:38:23.448]  God said, I'm going to tune you up.
[04:38:23.828 --> 04:38:28.290]  You're going to be in a wilderness for a while, and then you're going to— That's what I've said, because I've experienced it.
[04:38:28.350 --> 04:38:30.251]  Literally, God's been working with me like a sculpture.
[04:38:31.064 --> 04:38:32.745]  And it's been this whole thing.
[04:38:32.805 --> 04:38:33.526]  It's amazing.
[04:38:33.686 --> 04:38:34.566]  A moment such as this.
[04:38:34.626 --> 04:38:35.047]  That's why.
[04:38:35.467 --> 04:38:43.152]  Because you are Crescendo right now at the same time as the evil is increasing.
[04:38:43.432 --> 04:38:44.373]  And now I see it.
[04:38:44.853 --> 04:38:45.793]  It's not me, it's God.
[04:38:45.874 --> 04:38:49.176]  I've been formed as a weapon literally for this moment.
[04:38:49.676 --> 04:38:51.217]  All this preparation was to do this.
[04:38:51.277 --> 04:38:52.338]  It's incredible.
[04:38:52.918 --> 04:38:55.200]  Fifth generation warfare in full wars.
[04:38:55.500 --> 04:38:56.181]  That's what that is.
[04:38:57.402 --> 04:39:05.548]  You are matching that evil with your ability to bring out the message and that's why you are one of the number one targets for the enemy.
[04:39:06.329 --> 04:39:06.929]  It's not me though.
[04:39:06.949 --> 04:39:07.590]  It's all God.
[04:39:07.650 --> 04:39:09.231]  I literally know they're going to do that.
[04:39:09.291 --> 04:39:10.172]  It's just crazy.
[04:39:10.252 --> 04:39:13.895]  It's like literally God tells me they're going to do this next week and I come on air and they do it.
[04:39:15.115 --> 04:39:17.598]  No, it is amazing, but you're matching it.
[04:39:17.939 --> 04:39:18.619]  Fight for fight.
[04:39:19.160 --> 04:39:19.741]  You're matching it.
[04:39:20.021 --> 04:39:21.022]  Well, that's Newtonian physics.
[04:39:21.082 --> 04:39:22.143]  I was saying that before you came on.
[04:39:23.145 --> 04:39:25.828]  Whatever they do, it's this weird match.
[04:39:26.709 --> 04:39:27.510]  It's crazy.
[04:39:28.631 --> 04:39:29.051]  Exactly.
[04:39:29.091 --> 04:39:29.692]  It is crazy.
[04:39:29.752 --> 04:39:34.398]  And I'm seeing it from the outside, but I'm seeing it where we're on food.
[04:39:35.117 --> 04:39:36.018]  Ted Nugent the other day.
[04:39:36.058 --> 04:39:38.159]  We're up here in Terrell, Texas trying to help a rancher out.
[04:39:38.199 --> 04:39:40.861]  They killed 249 of his deer that he's trying to raise.
[04:39:41.181 --> 04:39:42.241]  They're slaughtering everything.
[04:39:42.261 --> 04:39:42.682]  Slaughtered them.
[04:39:42.982 --> 04:39:45.724]  And it was a satanic blood ritual that took place.
[04:39:46.084 --> 04:39:48.305]  They waited until the cover of darkness to do this.
[04:39:49.126 --> 04:39:50.287]  They don't care about the feral hogs.
[04:39:50.507 --> 04:39:50.867]  They don't care.
[04:39:51.107 --> 04:39:55.511]  They don't care about the wild deer that are out there, because these are ranchers, deer breeders.
[04:39:55.671 --> 04:39:56.852]  That are creating the best stock.
[04:39:57.052 --> 04:40:04.039]  Creating the best stock, and the food goes to... For those that don't know, they create these stock tags that create better deer, they release them.
[04:40:04.059 --> 04:40:04.599]  They're healthier.
[04:40:05.119 --> 04:40:05.240]  Right.
[04:40:05.680 --> 04:40:08.763]  And so, and some people hunt them, but they release them, they release them in the wild.
[04:40:08.823 --> 04:40:10.504]  That makes money to fund a better stock.
[04:40:10.564 --> 04:40:11.105]  It's a crop.
[04:40:11.385 --> 04:40:11.625]  Correct.
[04:40:12.006 --> 04:40:19.396]  And so, but what they do is they've created this new prion disease, which supposedly, uh, supposedly, uh, is, is causing the deer to die.
[04:40:19.436 --> 04:40:20.177]  Well, they're not dying.
[04:40:20.657 --> 04:40:21.338]  So there's Joe.
[04:40:21.819 --> 04:40:22.500]  I like your dog.
[04:40:22.880 --> 04:40:26.525]  He's been, he's been in the, uh, in the truck for, for a long time.
[04:40:26.565 --> 04:40:26.705]  Yeah.
[04:40:26.725 --> 04:40:27.746]  Joe is good.
[04:40:27.766 --> 04:40:28.087]  Stealing.
[04:40:29.669 --> 04:40:30.709]  No, but keep going.
[04:40:30.910 --> 04:40:32.191]  I don't tell listeners this stuff.
[04:40:32.231 --> 04:40:33.211]  It's not mojo.
[04:40:33.272 --> 04:40:34.292]  It's not bullshit.
[04:40:34.793 --> 04:40:36.154]  This is real, man.
[04:40:36.174 --> 04:40:37.635]  This is going on.
[04:40:38.416 --> 04:40:46.282]  I can't even imagine these Satanists, while the public's falling to it, they are dialled into this weird, stab everybody in the back, lie, do whatever.
[04:40:46.342 --> 04:40:48.164]  I can't even imagine what's wrong with these people.
[04:40:49.414 --> 04:40:52.476]  Well, they operate out of fear, and we operate out of love.
[04:40:52.976 --> 04:40:54.057]  The truest virtue of war.
[04:40:54.097 --> 04:40:56.418]  And you were speaking about Thermopylae a little while ago.
[04:40:56.458 --> 04:40:56.759]  I was.
[04:40:57.179 --> 04:41:00.401]  So, at the Battle of Thermopylae, and I've been there... Tell the camera about it.
[04:41:00.421 --> 04:41:01.662]  I've been there four times, okay?
[04:41:01.702 --> 04:41:06.805]  I've been on this battlefield because I find that in my soul... The energy's amazing.
[04:41:07.065 --> 04:41:09.386]  Yeah, in my soul, I feel the terror.
[04:41:09.887 --> 04:41:13.288]  I feel the, of a thousand battlefields, I can feel the terror when I'm there.
[04:41:13.648 --> 04:41:14.249]  At Gettysburg.
[04:41:14.269 --> 04:41:17.991]  I felt that at Gettysburg, and I felt it at the Coliseum.
[04:41:18.011 --> 04:41:18.951]  You can feel the energy.
[04:41:18.991 --> 04:41:19.251]  Feel it.
[04:41:19.652 --> 04:41:28.056]  And at the Battle of Thermopylae, as they call it there, the Persians are coming through this narrow gap, and there's Mount Kalimdoros to your left, and the Malian Gulf is off to your right.
[04:41:28.436 --> 04:41:31.398]  And 300 Spartans with some local, other troops that were local.
[04:41:31.998 --> 04:41:32.498]  We're good to go.
[04:41:51.923 --> 04:41:53.784]  And they say, that's OK, we fight better in the shade.
[04:41:53.925 --> 04:41:54.625]  That was number one.
[04:41:55.025 --> 04:41:58.148]  Number two, they said, give up your weapons and we'll let you go.
[04:41:58.188 --> 04:41:59.909]  And they said, come and take them.
[04:42:00.009 --> 04:42:02.671]  That's where the Texans come from.
[04:42:02.691 --> 04:42:04.092]  From Gonzales and all of it.
[04:42:04.112 --> 04:42:06.814]  This was the Alamo, was the Thermopylae of Texas in 1836.
[04:42:07.115 --> 04:42:12.519]  So study history, study battles, and understand that this has been going on for a long time.
[04:42:13.039 --> 04:42:18.263]  That those that were standing in the gap at Thermopylae kept Europe from becoming Persian.
[04:42:19.820 --> 04:42:20.861]  And people talk about that.
[04:42:20.901 --> 04:42:21.621]  This is mainland.
[04:42:21.641 --> 04:42:22.562]  The Persians admitted it.
[04:42:23.082 --> 04:42:25.143]  How many did those 300 kill?
[04:42:26.163 --> 04:42:25.143]  50,000?
[04:42:26.203 --> 04:42:27.924]  They're just incredible warriors.
[04:42:27.984 --> 04:42:29.105]  It was in the tens of thousands.
[04:42:29.445 --> 04:42:29.645]  Yes.
[04:42:30.465 --> 04:42:31.646]  And they stood shield to shield.
[04:42:32.286 --> 04:42:34.327]  And as you said, come back with your shielder on it.
[04:42:35.028 --> 04:42:35.768]  That was what they did.
[04:42:35.788 --> 04:42:36.629]  My mother told me that.
[04:42:37.249 --> 04:42:41.211]  And the weird thing is that as a son, when your mother says that, it's like an order.
[04:42:41.411 --> 04:42:42.451]  You never forget that.
[04:42:42.712 --> 04:42:43.232]  Stuff like that.
[04:42:43.832 --> 04:42:46.654]  And you never forget when you're at that battlefield, you never forget a battle.
[04:42:47.035 --> 04:42:53.420]  But you have to understand that my shield on a phalanx, a phalanx is when a bunch of soldiers are in line and they're standing shield to shield.
[04:42:53.861 --> 04:42:59.825]  The reason the shield was the most important piece of equipment was my shield protected you, my battle buddy.
[04:43:00.206 --> 04:43:01.307]  My shield protected you.
[04:43:01.687 --> 04:43:04.730]  And the next guy's shield protected the next guy because that is what we do.
[04:43:04.770 --> 04:43:05.650]  We take care of each other.
[04:43:06.011 --> 04:43:08.172]  It wasn't your sword to fight to protect yourself.
[04:43:08.213 --> 04:43:09.814]  And it was the team that made him so powerful.
[04:43:10.014 --> 04:43:11.595]  And the team is what made them so powerful.
[04:43:11.775 --> 04:43:13.736]  And here's the other thing, the tactics of this.
[04:43:14.297 --> 04:43:15.658]  We bring them to our fight.
[04:43:16.218 --> 04:43:17.659]  They didn't go out in the open field and fight.
[04:43:17.679 --> 04:43:18.619]  They picked the right spot.
[04:43:18.639 --> 04:43:26.724]  They picked a narrow place where 300 guys in full armor could fight guys with wicker shields and little tiny spears and think that you're going to go up against the Spartans?
[04:43:26.964 --> 04:43:28.185]  No, you're not.
[04:43:28.445 --> 04:43:30.066]  But there was a time when they were surrounded.
[04:43:30.407 --> 04:43:31.347]  They had to give up their weapons.
[04:43:31.387 --> 04:43:31.827]  They wouldn't.
[04:43:32.108 --> 04:43:33.148]  And they're legends now.
[04:43:33.288 --> 04:43:33.769]  They all died.
[04:43:34.449 --> 04:43:52.865]  And it says there at the epitaph there, on the top of the hillock, where the last stand was, when they were holding Leonidas' body, it says, as Simonides wrote this, a stranger passing by, go tell the Spartans, because this is in Northern Greek, go back to Sparta and tell the Spartans that here we lie, obedient to their laws.
[04:43:53.956 --> 04:43:55.377]  They knew this was a suicide mission.
[04:43:55.677 --> 04:43:57.998]  They had to give enough time for the rest of the troops.
[04:43:58.018 --> 04:43:58.518]  Other armies.
[04:43:58.858 --> 04:44:05.301]  They all got together, and a year later... So instead of a general lying to troops to go die as they gambit, these guys knew they were gambiting.
[04:44:05.341 --> 04:44:06.362]  They knew they were going to die.
[04:44:06.842 --> 04:44:09.003]  And they went in there and they said... Just like the Alamo.
[04:44:09.283 --> 04:44:09.983]  Just like the Alamo.
[04:44:10.383 --> 04:44:16.866]  William Barrett Travis and Davey Crockett and all those people that came from other states, by the way, that are just as Texans as anybody else.
[04:44:17.527 --> 04:44:18.067]  And here's the deal.
[04:44:19.178 --> 04:44:20.039]  They knew they were going to die.
[04:44:20.079 --> 04:44:27.063]  A year later at the Battle of Plataea, all those hundreds of thousands of Persians went down there and they fought at the Battle of Plataea, which is down by Athens.
[04:44:28.035 --> 04:44:29.436]  And they whooped their butts and sent him home.
[04:44:29.996 --> 04:44:31.357]  It gave them enough time to do that.
[04:44:31.797 --> 04:44:32.418]  This is where we're at.
[04:44:32.438 --> 04:44:33.859]  That's why we bring them into our fight.
[04:44:33.899 --> 04:44:35.800]  We've got to bring them into our fight.
[04:44:35.860 --> 04:44:36.400]  Exactly.
[04:44:36.460 --> 04:44:38.702]  Solid Lizards know it's critical to support us.
[04:44:39.182 --> 04:44:40.403]  We chose this battle.
[04:44:40.903 --> 04:44:46.767]  We are not going to sit here, and I don't want to get into Texas lore because I don't live off my ancestors, but I had family at the Alamo.
[04:44:46.847 --> 04:44:49.229]  I had family that wrote the whole Texas deal.
[04:44:51.790 --> 04:44:54.751]  No, it was called Washington Brazos.
[04:44:54.811 --> 04:44:55.611]  Oh yeah, Washington Brazos.
[04:44:55.652 --> 04:44:58.052]  And then my family got the last letter from Travis.
[04:44:58.072 --> 04:45:00.413]  We raised Colonel Travis's son on my mom's side of the family.
[04:45:00.893 --> 04:45:02.434]  So they were all heavily involved.
[04:45:02.454 --> 04:45:06.215]  I don't live off my ancestors, but the point was they were fully committed.
[04:45:06.255 --> 04:45:07.556]  Those people were like tough.
[04:45:08.236 --> 04:45:10.717]  And I look back at my ancestors, they're looking down from heaven.
[04:45:10.737 --> 04:45:11.697]  I want to be like them.
[04:45:12.137 --> 04:45:13.038]  Like that's what I want to do.
[04:45:13.618 --> 04:45:14.679]  And that's what's amazing about this.
[04:45:14.699 --> 04:45:15.739]  We're repeating it again.
[04:45:15.759 --> 04:45:17.881]  I want listeners to know, you're already seeing it.
[04:45:18.781 --> 04:45:20.322]  They're going to shut this down, folks.
[04:45:20.342 --> 04:45:22.323]  They're probably going to indict me, put me in prison.
[04:45:22.343 --> 04:45:24.304]  I hate to say that, but it's where it is.
[04:45:24.905 --> 04:45:31.829]  But in that is the process of beating these communists that literally want to cut our sons' dicks off and our daughters' breasts off.
[04:45:32.229 --> 04:45:37.653]  Any time I think about leaving the country and trying to go and like, I want to take care of my family.
[04:45:37.993 --> 04:45:39.934]  My kids are dead anyways if we don't beat this.
[04:45:40.354 --> 04:45:40.554]  Right.
[04:45:40.614 --> 04:45:43.136]  So it's full commitment and that's what we're talking about.
[04:45:43.536 --> 04:45:43.916]  This is it.
[04:45:44.777 --> 04:45:49.439]  This is the hill that we will die on if we don't do the right thing right now.
[04:45:49.459 --> 04:45:53.082]  Yeah, because they're going to chase us if we run off the hill there and get us down the valley.
[04:45:53.642 --> 04:45:55.963]  At a certain point, explain that military history.
[04:45:56.103 --> 04:45:56.424]  Absolutely.
[04:45:56.444 --> 04:45:58.825]  There's a point where you've got to just say, I can't run.
[04:45:58.845 --> 04:45:59.926]  I can't.
[04:45:59.946 --> 04:46:01.486]  Yeah, I can do that very clearly.
[04:46:01.526 --> 04:46:02.687]  And this is really important.
[04:46:02.967 --> 04:46:07.410]  When you're ambushed as an infantryman or a ranger or a Green Beret, you know this.
[04:46:07.450 --> 04:46:09.191]  When you're ambushed, you attack the ambush.
[04:46:09.251 --> 04:46:12.633]  Because if you run away from it, that's when most of the slaughter takes place.
[04:46:12.873 --> 04:46:13.533]  As you're running away.
[04:46:13.593 --> 04:46:15.294]  That's why come home with your shields are on them.
[04:46:15.394 --> 04:46:18.115]  That's the women were saying we and we don't want you dead.
[04:46:18.135 --> 04:46:18.675]  Yeah.
[04:46:19.415 --> 04:46:19.955]  Yeah, that's it.
[04:46:20.456 --> 04:46:21.216]  They don't want them dead.
[04:46:21.256 --> 04:46:29.799]  But they know that that the the honor and prestige and esprit de corps of that particular warlike element that that that that band of brothers is out there.
[04:46:30.179 --> 04:46:34.801]  I was just in Toccoa, Georgia, where the band of brothers kicked off, right that that that that
[04:46:36.642 --> 04:46:39.384]  82nd 101st Airborne Unit that went downrange and jumped into Normandy.
[04:46:39.764 --> 04:46:40.585]  These are real things.
[04:46:40.625 --> 04:46:41.406]  These are real fights.
[04:46:41.466 --> 04:46:42.507]  And we are in a real fight.
[04:46:42.847 --> 04:46:44.829]  And if you don't think it, you better check it.
[04:46:44.849 --> 04:46:46.631]  My mother said, come home with your shoulder on it.
[04:46:47.031 --> 04:46:49.674]  Not because she wanted me to die, but because she wanted me to win.
[04:46:49.994 --> 04:46:51.816]  You've got to be fully committed to win a war.
[04:46:53.081 --> 04:46:56.482]  As much as jumping out of a plane into Normandy, you're fully committed once you're out that door.
[04:46:57.283 --> 04:46:57.783]  Absolutely.
[04:46:58.503 --> 04:47:01.985]  So in closing, talk about Trump, the persecution, the giant awakening.
[04:47:02.005 --> 04:47:02.885]  Where do you see this going?
[04:47:03.205 --> 04:47:04.726]  What advice do you want to give the listeners and viewers?
[04:47:05.066 --> 04:47:05.726]  Yeah, advice.
[04:47:06.366 --> 04:47:17.171]  Well, Trump, from what I understand, I haven't been watching much, but I'll just say that when charges like this happen and they're misdemeanors that turn into a felony, this is all a kangaroo court.
[04:47:17.831 --> 04:47:19.972]  We are in a banana republic if we allow this to happen.
[04:47:19.992 --> 04:47:20.732]  And people see through us.
[04:47:20.792 --> 04:47:22.333]  I'm saying, what do you expect the deep state to do next?
[04:47:22.932 --> 04:47:24.493]  Yeah, what do I expect them to do next?
[04:47:25.253 --> 04:47:26.354]  The vitriol is going to increase.
[04:47:26.394 --> 04:47:27.975]  It's going to get harder before it gets easier.
[04:47:28.896 --> 04:47:36.300]  I looked to the World Health Organization doing another, they've already passed the International Health Regulation, but it is not a treaty.
[04:47:36.360 --> 04:47:37.180]  Don't let them fool you.
[04:47:37.200 --> 04:47:39.001]  A treaty is not what it is.
[04:47:39.342 --> 04:47:46.206]  They just passed a piece of paper that's like a resolution, a strongly worded piece of paper that says that we can take your sovereignty.
[04:47:46.246 --> 04:47:48.047]  Well, how are you going to enforce that sovereignty?
[04:47:48.087 --> 04:47:48.807]  With blue helmets?
[04:47:49.127 --> 04:47:49.828]  With UN troops?
[04:47:50.028 --> 04:47:50.668]  I don't think so.
[04:47:50.888 --> 04:47:51.529]  Not in this country.
[04:47:51.929 --> 04:48:00.931]  So, that is what I see as the fear tactic, but we're going to defy, we are not going to comply, and we're going to remain Americans.
[04:48:00.971 --> 04:48:07.933]  Because as William Barrett Travis says, there is a character, American character, everything dear to the American character, that's real.
[04:48:08.433 --> 04:48:11.134]  I just had a conversation with somebody today about that.
[04:48:11.754 --> 04:48:13.255]  There's a character that's within us.
[04:48:13.315 --> 04:48:13.895]  It's in our DNA.
[04:48:14.815 --> 04:48:15.516]  It's in our DNA.
[04:48:15.576 --> 04:48:17.839]  Much like the Spartans DNA that ran through their blood.
[04:48:18.260 --> 04:48:19.521]  It is something that's passed on.
[04:48:20.002 --> 04:48:21.224]  You may not have been at the Alamo.
[04:48:21.444 --> 04:48:22.185]  Your family was.
[04:48:22.806 --> 04:48:23.607]  It's passed on to you.
[04:48:24.008 --> 04:48:24.708]  That's in your DNA.
[04:48:24.749 --> 04:48:25.970]  That's why you're up here fighting.
[04:48:26.291 --> 04:48:27.552]  It's not a kinetic fight right now.
[04:48:27.793 --> 04:48:28.574]  We don't want it to be.
[04:48:29.755 --> 04:48:36.540]  Well I almost get embarrassed when I'm trying to be just a family guy that I don't want to die, I don't want to whatever, but I'm ready to.
[04:48:36.640 --> 04:48:37.681]  It's like I'm ready.
[04:48:37.721 --> 04:48:39.682]  It's like my whole body says do it.
[04:48:40.242 --> 04:48:41.463]  Never back down, never stop.
[04:48:41.523 --> 04:48:42.224]  It's like go all the way.
[04:48:42.764 --> 04:48:43.865]  Never back down.
[04:48:44.205 --> 04:48:45.446]  We don't live in a spirit of fear.
[04:48:45.887 --> 04:48:48.869]  That of peace, of power, of love.
[04:48:48.989 --> 04:48:52.011]  And that's what freaks the Satanists out is they're so scared of death.
[04:48:52.571 --> 04:48:52.932]  We're not.
[04:48:53.942 --> 04:48:54.102]  Right.
[04:48:54.643 --> 04:48:59.327]  And they don't have control, and we have self-control, which comes along with that not living in the spirit of fear thing.
[04:48:59.687 --> 04:49:00.508]  Self-control.
[04:49:00.948 --> 04:49:01.789]  What is a good operator?
[04:49:01.809 --> 04:49:04.091]  You're not worried about death, you're so much calmer.
[04:49:04.171 --> 04:49:05.412]  It's like you just do stuff.
[04:49:05.532 --> 04:49:06.473]  You've given that up.
[04:49:07.073 --> 04:49:16.862]  When I gave that up in Iraq after I thought I was going to die on the 12th of May 2004, and I had a choice on the 13th of May 2004, am I going to go out that gate again and fight like I did before?
[04:49:17.302 --> 04:49:20.004]  And I made the choice and said, I'm dead already, let's go.
[04:49:20.825 --> 04:49:21.966]  And that's what you... I've said that.
[04:49:22.046 --> 04:49:24.369]  That's really... That's exactly how I feel.
[04:49:24.389 --> 04:49:26.291]  And it's not like I want to commit suicide.
[04:49:26.331 --> 04:49:27.272]  Don't let them spin that.
[04:49:27.352 --> 04:49:28.133]  I'll never commit suicide.
[04:49:28.153 --> 04:49:28.614]  I love life.
[04:49:29.154 --> 04:49:34.240]  But I get like being a pussy and getting into fear is a lie.
[04:49:34.520 --> 04:49:36.242]  Being dead already is like a superpower.
[04:49:36.582 --> 04:49:36.923]  That's right.
[04:49:37.703 --> 04:49:41.147]  And we know that the ultimate battle belongs to God through Revelation.
[04:49:41.447 --> 04:49:45.011]  But we also know that these bodies, these meat sacks as we call it, right?
[04:49:45.391 --> 04:49:47.934]  There's a spirit, there's a soul, and there's a flesh.
[04:49:48.534 --> 04:49:52.218]  When you get them in the right order, when I used to live in the flesh, it squashed my spirit.
[04:49:52.438 --> 04:49:55.622]  I couldn't do enough to try not to... That's so powerful.
[04:49:55.642 --> 04:49:57.804]  When you aren't worried about dying, the spirit goes to the top.
[04:49:57.984 --> 04:50:00.928]  When you flip that spear on top, your hourglass gets reclaimed.
[04:50:01.088 --> 04:50:01.849]  It reclaims you.
[04:50:01.950 --> 04:50:04.072]  God says in the Bible, He will reclaim your life.
[04:50:04.373 --> 04:50:05.234]  He'll give you better health.
[04:50:05.254 --> 04:50:06.336]  He'll give you all these other things.
[04:50:06.816 --> 04:50:08.599]  But this isn't a Joel Osteen kind of thing.
[04:50:08.879 --> 04:50:09.720]  This is you gotta work.
[04:50:09.740 --> 04:50:10.922]  Yeah, it's not name it and claim it.
[04:50:11.242 --> 04:50:11.423]  No.
[04:50:11.703 --> 04:50:12.644]  Faith that works is dead.
[04:50:13.005 --> 04:50:13.305]  Bingo!
[04:50:13.565 --> 04:50:14.266]  That's exactly it.
[04:50:14.867 --> 04:50:19.549]  Get that hourglass, flip it around, put the spirit on top, it squashes the flesh.
[04:50:19.869 --> 04:50:20.409]  Flesh is there.
[04:50:20.630 --> 04:50:22.810]  I'm always going to look at something I probably shouldn't look at.
[04:50:23.171 --> 04:50:23.991]  No, exactly.
[04:50:24.091 --> 04:50:28.293]  I used to, I would cheat and do it, but now that I put the spirit on top, I don't do it.
[04:50:28.773 --> 04:50:28.953]  Bingo.
[04:50:28.973 --> 04:50:29.893]  That's it.
[04:50:30.154 --> 04:50:35.516]  Or a guy starts a fight, I know I can kill him, it would feel really good, but now the spirit's on top, I don't do it.
[04:50:36.226 --> 04:50:37.487]  Yeah, but I mean, it's still kind of fun.
[04:50:39.688 --> 04:50:40.428]  But yeah, you're right.
[04:50:40.808 --> 04:50:44.570]  Yeah, I mean, it's what creates that self-control.
[04:50:44.990 --> 04:50:46.011]  See, that's what we're talking about.
[04:50:46.211 --> 04:50:56.816]  It's why an operator comes in the room and he knows how to take care of business, because he has... And our... Well, speaking of... I'm trying to say most of the best military people are Christians, because you can't even do this if you're not... It doesn't work.
[04:50:57.616 --> 04:51:00.638]  Well, if we're talking about... Here's a good statistic for you.
[04:51:01.584 --> 04:51:04.209]  It was written in 480 BC, right after the Battle of Thermopylae.
[04:51:04.229 --> 04:51:05.651]  It was written by a guy named Heraclitus.
[04:51:05.691 --> 04:51:07.334]  He wrote of the Spartans at that battle.
[04:51:07.815 --> 04:51:10.039]  Out of a hundred soldiers, ten shouldn't even be here.
[04:51:11.477 --> 04:51:18.803]  80 are nothing but targets, and nine, they the battle make, and we're lucky to have them, but the one is a leader, and he'll bring the others back.
[04:51:19.243 --> 04:51:21.966]  Those numbers haven't changed much since 480 BC.
[04:51:22.486 --> 04:51:24.488]  So, and I've seen it, but here's the deal.
[04:51:25.108 --> 04:51:29.212]  With special operations, because it's a selection process, there's people of higher calling.
[04:51:29.232 --> 04:51:30.693]  They believe in something higher than themselves.
[04:51:30.973 --> 04:51:32.374]  You're gonna have more Christians there.
[04:51:32.394 --> 04:51:34.776]  They believe in something bigger than themselves.
[04:51:35.336 --> 04:51:37.018]  When I joined, that's all I wanted to be.
[04:51:37.038 --> 04:51:40.401]  I watched a John Wayne movie when I was a little kid and said, I'm gonna be a Green Beret.
[04:51:41.101 --> 04:51:42.063]  And finally became one.
[04:51:42.343 --> 04:51:45.848]  But it was because I had something that was bigger than me in front of me.
[04:51:46.349 --> 04:51:52.037]  I wasn't a good believer at the time, but boy, after I became one, I was the most dangerous soldier on the battlefield.
[04:51:52.337 --> 04:51:52.978]  Doctor or not.
[04:51:53.905 --> 04:51:54.665]  Still taking care of it.
[04:51:54.685 --> 04:51:57.026]  Well, I tell listeners this, and not a lot of people have seen it.
[04:51:57.806 --> 04:51:59.767]  God just gives me over-the-horizon stuff.
[04:51:59.827 --> 04:52:00.747]  It's crazy.
[04:52:00.787 --> 04:52:01.627]  Like, God's real.
[04:52:01.647 --> 04:52:03.248]  Like, I don't know this stuff.
[04:52:03.308 --> 04:52:04.008]  I'm not doing this.
[04:52:04.068 --> 04:52:09.630]  It's like... You may or may not remember, but about six months ago, I sent you a text and I said, you're anointed.
[04:52:09.870 --> 04:52:10.990]  You have an anointment.
[04:52:11.991 --> 04:52:13.151]  That's important.
[04:52:13.171 --> 04:52:19.413]  That is like, you have an audience, people are listening to you, and the more that you walk in the power of the Lord is upon you,
[04:52:20.467 --> 04:52:26.354]  The more people will get what they need to get through the Holy Spirit to them, but through the ears to hear and eyes to see.
[04:52:26.855 --> 04:52:28.797]  So should we pray for President Trump?
[04:52:29.158 --> 04:52:30.119]  Yes, absolutely.
[04:52:30.620 --> 04:52:30.800]  Yeah.
[04:52:31.180 --> 04:52:31.441]  All right.
[04:52:31.561 --> 04:52:33.002]  Well, how do people find you?
[04:52:33.223 --> 04:52:34.044]  Thank you so much.
[04:52:34.684 --> 04:52:35.405]  I apologize.
[04:52:35.526 --> 04:52:37.388]  I forgot you were here and left you in the studio for an hour.
[04:52:37.648 --> 04:52:42.271]  Just stand on the side of any Texas road and you'll probably see me passing you tomorrow because that's what I do, I drive.
[04:52:42.291 --> 04:52:44.372]  Well, yeah, everybody's asking what's going to happen.
[04:52:44.412 --> 04:52:45.453]  They tried to shut it down.
[04:52:45.473 --> 04:52:47.214]  It was so easy.
[04:52:47.274 --> 04:52:48.215]  These people are so pathetic.
[04:52:48.255 --> 04:52:49.956]  I'm like, you don't even have a law or an order.
[04:52:50.396 --> 04:52:52.838]  I just had like the security company check the law and they backed off.
[04:52:53.138 --> 04:52:54.879]  Everybody's like, oh God, well then it's not a problem.
[04:52:54.919 --> 04:52:56.380]  No, they're trying to shut it down.
[04:52:56.440 --> 04:53:00.382]  This is, so even though the first attack is weak, it means they're doing it.
[04:53:00.783 --> 04:53:01.743]  So I'm going to explain that.
[04:53:02.144 --> 04:53:03.765]  It's like, oh, well then you're still here.
[04:53:04.585 --> 04:53:09.916]  Yeah, so we caught them and now they're doing it, so they're going to come back.
[04:53:10.297 --> 04:53:14.405]  And again, let's move away from InfoWars, folks, because I'm just a person.
[04:53:15.868 --> 04:53:17.849]  They're trying to start a nuclear war.
[04:53:18.189 --> 04:53:19.710]  They're going crazy after Trump.
[04:53:20.050 --> 04:53:26.613]  The fact that they so recklessly went after us shows that they are more dangerous because they're not smart.
[04:53:27.113 --> 04:53:27.773]  That's my issue.
[04:53:27.853 --> 04:53:29.254]  I don't look at them and say, they're pathetic.
[04:53:29.314 --> 04:53:30.054]  I just beat them.
[04:53:30.454 --> 04:53:30.995]  I'm so smart.
[04:53:31.035 --> 04:53:33.416]  I go, whoa, these people are dangerous.
[04:53:33.456 --> 04:53:34.016]  They're caged.
[04:53:34.056 --> 04:53:35.937]  They're like a feral hog in a cage.
[04:53:36.497 --> 04:53:39.379]  You're going to reach into a cage and grab a feral hog?
[04:53:39.459 --> 04:53:39.999]  No, you're not.
[04:53:40.059 --> 04:53:41.540]  Because that's very, very dangerous.
[04:53:41.841 --> 04:53:42.581]  So that's where they're at.
[04:53:42.741 --> 04:53:43.562]  And they're on their spurs.
[04:53:43.942 --> 04:53:44.222]  Got it.
[04:53:45.363 --> 04:53:46.264]  But we've got to match them.
[04:53:46.464 --> 04:53:49.085]  And because of what you said, you have a vision, right?
[04:53:49.186 --> 04:53:50.226]  And you do have anointment.
[04:53:50.707 --> 04:53:51.447]  And you have that vision.
[04:53:51.807 --> 04:53:53.588]  That vision is what we call being left to bang.
[04:53:53.649 --> 04:53:55.250]  So the bang is the IED in the road.
[04:53:55.910 --> 04:53:57.251]  You're seeing it before you get there.
[04:53:57.371 --> 04:53:58.071]  I learned to do that.
[04:53:58.152 --> 04:54:00.993]  When my truck got blown up, I learned how to be really good with IEDs.
[04:54:01.013 --> 04:54:01.574]  How to avoid them.
[04:54:01.954 --> 04:54:03.335]  Because you pay attention to cues.
[04:54:03.375 --> 04:54:05.697]  And when you get two or three cues, you don't go down that street.
[04:54:06.477 --> 04:54:07.617]  And you start figuring out how to move.
[04:54:07.637 --> 04:54:09.878]  You learn, you can't even quantify it.
[04:54:09.898 --> 04:54:11.779]  Your brain is now, you just know.
[04:54:12.239 --> 04:54:12.999]  It's a heuristic.
[04:54:13.159 --> 04:54:13.820]  It's a heuristic.
[04:54:13.860 --> 04:54:15.560]  Heuristic comes from the Greek word Eureka.
[04:54:15.620 --> 04:54:16.040]  I found it.
[04:54:16.481 --> 04:54:17.521]  So it's a heuristic.
[04:54:17.561 --> 04:54:23.783]  And when you have a heuristic, and you have the Holy Spirit then whispering in your ear, that still small voice telling you, hey bro, check it out.
[04:54:23.983 --> 04:54:24.544]  Don't do this.
[04:54:24.824 --> 04:54:25.944]  And here's what's happening over here.
[04:54:26.504 --> 04:54:31.626]  Collectively though, collectively it makes us extremely dangerous to the enemy because... And they know that.
[04:54:31.666 --> 04:54:32.767]  It's not about how great we are.
[04:54:32.807 --> 04:54:33.887]  They are afraid of this power.
[04:54:34.147 --> 04:54:35.848]  That's why they're trying to squash the book.
[04:54:36.028 --> 04:54:38.190]  They're talking about certain chapters of the book.
[04:54:38.310 --> 04:54:42.713]  It's scary to them because you're talking about the Zionists and things like that.
[04:54:42.733 --> 04:54:43.573]  Well, that scares them.
[04:54:43.914 --> 04:54:44.834]  Don't talk about that.
[04:54:45.194 --> 04:54:46.876]  Well, then we're going to make it illegal eventually.
[04:54:46.976 --> 04:54:53.120]  I don't say they're doing that right now, but I'm just looking at what happened in Germany with Bibles and I'm just saying.
[04:54:53.820 --> 04:54:56.842]  They're using Zionism and Israel as a template to make us fight.
[04:54:57.343 --> 04:54:57.803]  It's happening.
[04:54:58.403 --> 04:55:01.465]  It's a Hegelian dialectic and a synthesis is being created through that.
[04:55:01.585 --> 04:55:02.446]  Well, that's another question.
[04:55:02.466 --> 04:55:03.387]  If you've got time, we'll keep going.
[04:55:04.587 --> 04:55:13.590]  I'm not anti-Israel, but clearly Israel is a cog founding Hamas, working with Iran, standing down for seven and a half hours, when attack helicopters are ten minutes away.
[04:55:14.150 --> 04:55:15.070]  That was staged.
[04:55:15.590 --> 04:55:19.992]  So then they do all this, they won't free the hostages, they're gonna ship them here.
[04:55:20.492 --> 04:55:24.613]  This is part of a... I think that's why Iran killed their president, because I think they found out he was working with Israel.
[04:55:24.975 --> 04:55:29.878]  All religions have been, in many ways, all religions have a certain element of being usurped.
[04:55:30.519 --> 04:55:34.621]  The Catholic Charities on the border, the HIAC, you know, Michael Yon talks about.
[04:55:34.641 --> 04:55:35.442]  Yeah, the Jewish group.
[04:55:35.482 --> 04:55:35.922]  Jewish group.
[04:55:36.322 --> 04:55:38.764]  These things have been usurped using the name of religion.
[04:55:39.164 --> 04:55:40.625]  So, we need to get away from that.
[04:55:40.705 --> 04:55:43.127]  We just need to talk about the Holy Spirit and God.
[04:55:43.527 --> 04:55:44.748]  And that's pretty much it, right?
[04:55:45.228 --> 04:55:46.109]  That's just the way it is.
[04:55:46.389 --> 04:55:47.630]  I respect all religions.
[04:55:48.050 --> 04:55:48.350]  Exactly.
[04:55:48.370 --> 04:55:52.313]  Whether you're Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Hindu, whatever, God's real bow down right now.
[04:55:52.853 --> 04:55:57.737]  God is real, there is a Holy Spirit, works with God, and it's real.
[04:55:58.117 --> 04:55:59.578]  And Jesus Christ is my Savior.
[04:56:00.515 --> 04:56:03.758]  If you don't believe in Jesus Christ, the only thing I can do is tell you about him.
[04:56:03.978 --> 04:56:04.519]  Because I love him.
[04:56:05.139 --> 04:56:05.820]  That's the only thing I can do.
[04:56:05.920 --> 04:56:06.500]  Well, they fear it.
[04:56:06.580 --> 04:56:07.801]  Satan is real.
[04:56:07.881 --> 04:56:08.742]  It has the power.
[04:56:09.163 --> 04:56:18.050]  I'm not going to tell you who, but very multiple famous people, like the biggest names in America, who weren't even Christians five years ago, got demonically attacked.
[04:56:18.951 --> 04:56:21.073]  And then they cried out to Jesus and it went away.
[04:56:21.493 --> 04:56:22.494]  So this is how real it is.
[04:56:23.555 --> 04:56:24.215]  Say his name.
[04:56:25.376 --> 04:56:27.678]  Guys, I pledge to not tell you the names.
[04:56:28.464 --> 04:56:30.627]  Who are the other... It's not Joe Rogan.
[04:56:31.028 --> 04:56:32.810]  Who are the other two biggest people in America?
[04:56:33.371 --> 04:56:34.212]  It's not Elon Musk.
[04:56:34.753 --> 04:56:35.534]  Who else would it be?
[04:56:35.694 --> 04:56:36.495]  Is it Donald Trump?
[04:56:36.555 --> 04:56:36.795]  Is it...
[04:56:38.980 --> 04:56:40.021]  Is it Tucker Carlson?
[04:56:40.061 --> 04:56:43.603]  I'm not going to tell you the name, but they have literally didn't believe in God.
[04:56:43.623 --> 04:56:45.124]  They were anti-God.
[04:56:45.144 --> 04:56:45.965]  They said it was real.
[04:56:46.225 --> 04:56:49.687]  They literally got attacked, and then God said, cry out to Jesus, and the thing went away.
[04:56:50.108 --> 04:56:56.172]  Literally in their rooms, a black shadow attacks them and rips their skin, and they're bleeding everywhere.
[04:56:56.272 --> 04:56:59.534]  I mean, guys, strike me down, God, if I'm lying.
[04:56:59.654 --> 04:57:00.234]  I'm not lying.
[04:57:00.494 --> 04:57:01.615]  I'm not going to tell you who this happened to.
[04:57:01.995 --> 04:57:04.477]  These people are being demonically attacked.
[04:57:04.817 --> 04:57:06.098]  This is hell.
[04:57:06.118 --> 04:57:08.580]  The Bible says at the end days, it's being opened right now.
[04:57:09.120 --> 04:57:12.445]  The spiritual is actually more real than the tactile.
[04:57:12.465 --> 04:57:13.626]  Yeah, we're the only third dimension.
[04:57:13.646 --> 04:57:14.247]  There's all the others.
[04:57:14.848 --> 04:57:15.088]  That's it.
[04:57:15.368 --> 04:57:19.553]  And if we're going to talk about that, then we have to talk about the more
[04:57:20.410 --> 04:57:21.150]  How it's more real.
[04:57:21.691 --> 04:57:25.052]  And when you start to see in it, when you start to feel it, then it's more real.
[04:57:25.072 --> 04:57:28.413]  So I've had a lot of psychic experiences, and the best soldiers I know have all had them.
[04:57:28.453 --> 04:57:32.215]  So, don't call it psychic, over-the-horizon, God information.
[04:57:32.615 --> 04:57:37.757]  What have you had where you're like, you're like just walking along, you're like, right there, the guy's about to kill you, the guy's right there.
[04:57:37.777 --> 04:57:38.517]  That's happened to me.
[04:57:38.818 --> 04:57:40.258]  Like, have you had those experiences?
[04:57:40.318 --> 04:57:40.738]  Absolutely.
[04:57:41.459 --> 04:57:41.939]  All the time.
[04:57:41.999 --> 04:57:45.020]  I mean, it is, when you walk in them, you have more.
[04:57:45.400 --> 04:57:47.541]  When you understand it, you have more, because you can ask for it.
[04:57:47.561 --> 04:57:48.141]  It says seek.
[04:57:48.261 --> 04:57:49.042]  No, you're dialed in.
[04:57:49.082 --> 04:57:49.502]  You're dialed in.
[04:57:50.042 --> 04:57:50.603]  You shall find.
[04:57:51.063 --> 04:57:52.604]  Knock and the door shall be opened unto you.
[04:57:52.624 --> 04:57:53.325]  So, give us a story.
[04:57:54.165 --> 04:58:01.971]  So, you know, the next IED would be in Afghanistan and we're coming down south to Ghazni and we had MRAPs at that point.
[04:58:02.031 --> 04:58:02.872]  These weren't Humvees.
[04:58:03.192 --> 04:58:11.078]  And we're going south and it was just a, I know that this is, because this looks like this, I got eyes to see, this is a discernment, okay?
[04:58:11.778 --> 04:58:12.378]  It's discernment.
[04:58:12.479 --> 04:58:14.400]  The Holy Spirit's telling you there's something wrong here.
[04:58:14.420 --> 04:58:15.601]  Sometimes people say... You don't got to sell me.
[04:58:15.701 --> 04:58:17.062]  It's a sixth sense, right?
[04:58:17.102 --> 04:58:17.922]  The hair stands up.
[04:58:18.343 --> 04:58:19.083]  The hair stands up.
[04:58:19.463 --> 04:58:20.184]  And you say, stop.
[04:58:20.424 --> 04:58:20.684]  All right?
[04:58:21.305 --> 04:58:24.907]  So I'm the truck, the lead truck, because they know that I'm good with IDs after being blown up.
[04:58:25.588 --> 04:58:26.588]  Doc, we want you in the front.
[04:58:27.049 --> 04:58:27.989]  OK, so then I'm watching.
[04:58:28.409 --> 04:58:30.071]  And it's just, at that point,
[04:58:30.831 --> 04:58:31.111]  Stop.
[04:58:31.331 --> 04:58:31.992]  Stop the vehicle.
[04:58:32.212 --> 04:58:33.233]  Get the EOD guys out.
[04:58:33.333 --> 04:58:34.093]  They go do their job.
[04:58:34.213 --> 04:58:36.655]  Yeah, we got 10,000 pounds of organophosphate in this ditch.
[04:58:37.035 --> 04:58:40.818]  Which would send a... And what... it was just... you just knew?
[04:58:41.218 --> 04:58:41.539]  Just knew.
[04:58:42.159 --> 04:58:43.100]  Yeah, because you're sensing it.
[04:58:43.120 --> 04:58:43.960]  And you've been there before.
[04:58:43.980 --> 04:58:47.062]  And they all know the FBI and everybody secretly uses psychics.
[04:58:47.343 --> 04:58:48.784]  Not the fake ones on TV, the real ones.
[04:58:48.824 --> 04:58:50.265]  Like, they know.
[04:58:50.585 --> 04:58:57.249]  There's a name for that where they can remote view and they can do things and they can use... Stanley Kubrick was a big remote viewer.
[04:58:57.630 --> 04:58:58.390]  That's a big secret.
[04:58:58.430 --> 04:58:59.371]  I learned from my daughter.
[04:58:59.671 --> 04:59:02.854]  So, I know about those programs, the men who stare with goats, that was at Fort Bragg.
[04:59:02.894 --> 04:59:04.916]  I made a joke about it, but the point, it's all real.
[04:59:05.196 --> 04:59:10.060]  So, but the thing is, you were literally, after you got dialed in, you just said, what did you see on there?
[04:59:10.100 --> 04:59:13.203]  Was there any temporal thing, or was it just like, stop, there's a bomb right there?
[04:59:13.623 --> 04:59:14.584]  Stop, there's a bomb right there.
[04:59:14.624 --> 04:59:19.108]  But this is, now that's the military sense, but in the other senses,
[04:59:19.628 --> 04:59:20.688]  But what did you pick up?
[04:59:20.708 --> 04:59:22.169]  Because you were saying, well, someone else said it.
[04:59:22.529 --> 04:59:22.889]  I get it.
[04:59:23.049 --> 04:59:23.889]  God gives us clues.
[04:59:23.909 --> 04:59:24.189]  No, no, no.
[04:59:24.209 --> 04:59:27.810]  There are certain things that you would look for and say, there's an aiming stake over there, or there's this or that.
[04:59:27.850 --> 04:59:28.531]  We're in a desert.
[04:59:28.571 --> 04:59:30.431]  This is not like we're in a city.
[04:59:30.791 --> 04:59:32.852]  We're in a desert.
[04:59:32.952 --> 04:59:37.113]  And so there wasn't anything that I saw that I said, oh, there's some disturbed dirt there.
[04:59:37.153 --> 04:59:37.733]  This wasn't that.
[04:59:37.773 --> 04:59:38.573]  This was just stop.
[04:59:38.613 --> 04:59:39.394]  This doesn't look right.
[04:59:39.454 --> 04:59:40.294]  This doesn't feel right.
[04:59:40.894 --> 04:59:42.215]  I didn't see anything particular.
[04:59:42.355 --> 04:59:42.835]  Exactly.
[04:59:43.215 --> 04:59:45.136]  And I, because we're limited.
[04:59:45.156 --> 04:59:46.617]  We're not God, but God's telling us.
[04:59:46.917 --> 04:59:47.518]  That's what I've learned.
[04:59:47.558 --> 04:59:48.939]  Like, I don't even see what it is.
[04:59:49.379 --> 04:59:50.560]  I'm just told stop.
[04:59:51.220 --> 04:59:51.700]  Exactly.
[04:59:51.740 --> 04:59:53.241]  God's like, look, this is what it is.
[04:59:53.681 --> 04:59:54.702]  And that's what's so amazing.
[04:59:54.742 --> 04:59:55.602]  We are eternal beings.
[04:59:55.622 --> 04:59:56.503]  That's great news.
[04:59:56.843 --> 04:59:57.844]  Like, this is amazing.
[04:59:58.547 --> 05:00:01.208]  If you walk in it, you'll have the ears to hear, eyes to see.
[05:00:01.228 --> 05:00:01.569]  You will.
[05:00:02.029 --> 05:00:07.091]  It's just that it takes a while to develop that, but you can get it like that if you accept it.
[05:00:07.111 --> 05:00:08.072]  But you've got to take a knee.
[05:00:08.152 --> 05:00:10.253]  I was about to say, I said that on the show.
[05:00:10.793 --> 05:00:12.214]  I would ignore this my whole life.
[05:00:13.114 --> 05:00:17.116]  And now, I finally got to the point where I just, I take the orders.
[05:00:17.236 --> 05:00:18.377]  Like, I don't even question.
[05:00:18.837 --> 05:00:19.878]  And it's incredible.
[05:00:20.118 --> 05:00:21.499]  That's the obedience over sacrifice.
[05:00:22.099 --> 05:00:26.081]  When you exhibit that, sometimes it's, you're in a wilderness, sometimes you're not.
[05:00:26.501 --> 05:00:28.082]  But I'll tell you, when you walk in that,
[05:00:28.602 --> 05:00:29.444]  There's power in that.
[05:00:30.526 --> 05:00:33.432]  You have the authorities to have the powers that Jesus Christ had.
[05:00:33.813 --> 05:00:35.476]  He says, you will have them greater than me.
[05:00:35.857 --> 05:00:36.558]  To his apostles.
[05:00:36.738 --> 05:00:37.219]  To our men.
[05:00:38.086 --> 05:00:39.166]  You will have them greater than me.
[05:00:39.226 --> 05:00:39.887]  That's scary.
[05:00:40.067 --> 05:00:41.107]  He wants to give you that.
[05:00:41.527 --> 05:00:42.988]  But we don't, we don't walk in it.
[05:00:43.028 --> 05:00:43.848]  We don't ask for it.
[05:00:43.948 --> 05:00:44.689]  Exactly.
[05:00:44.709 --> 05:00:46.929]  That's what I'm now getting is the enemy's coming in like a flood.
[05:00:46.949 --> 05:00:48.450]  God doesn't have a standard against it.
[05:00:48.790 --> 05:00:52.171]  The more I submit, it's like every day it's getting crazy.
[05:00:52.231 --> 05:01:02.015]  It's like... If we were to flood this world with the Holy Spirit and the love for mankind between us, we would overwhelm them and they would literally probably just melt.
[05:01:02.315 --> 05:01:02.675]  I don't know.
[05:01:02.695 --> 05:01:03.716]  That's why they're creating all the hate.
[05:01:04.116 --> 05:01:05.037]  That's why they're creating the hate.
[05:01:05.057 --> 05:01:09.320]  There's a dissension between the races and between people and between the classes.
[05:01:09.681 --> 05:01:10.822]  That's why they're creating that hate.
[05:01:11.222 --> 05:01:21.470]  That's why they sent us to 20 years of war, so we could leave everything in Afghanistan, so we could end up using those same weapons to come down through the Darien Gap, probably, or down through the southern border here that I worked on.
[05:01:22.011 --> 05:01:26.554]  And it doesn't mean that the attacks aren't real, but they're satanically manipulated.
[05:01:27.015 --> 05:01:29.217]  And only by Christ transcending it do we defeat it.
[05:01:29.237 --> 05:01:31.979]  It transcends all understanding, yes.
[05:01:32.830 --> 05:01:33.771]  Yeah, that's it.
[05:01:34.151 --> 05:01:36.313]  Well, I don't want to scare listeners.
[05:01:36.353 --> 05:01:37.254]  We're going to end this right now.
[05:01:37.354 --> 05:01:38.395]  Dr. Chamberlain, I appreciate you.
[05:01:39.156 --> 05:01:47.885]  I am, as a person, fleshly, very upset because I can see all the change happening and the energy being so strong.
[05:01:48.345 --> 05:01:52.089]  Big stuff's going down because I've learned Newtonian physics that God created.
[05:01:52.109 --> 05:01:54.191]  Newton just kind of quantified it.
[05:01:54.671 --> 05:01:56.493]  For every action, there's an opposite-equal reaction.
[05:01:56.533 --> 05:02:05.219]  So if our power level is going way up, which mine is, and I think you can probably say your ability, it's going way up.
[05:02:06.340 --> 05:02:10.484]  It's like in Lord of the Rings, when the goblins are close, the sword of sting glows.
[05:02:11.164 --> 05:02:12.386]  The sword's white hot.
[05:02:13.126 --> 05:02:14.788]  So we're like, oh, look, our sword's white hot.
[05:02:14.888 --> 05:02:15.249]  Yeah, man.
[05:02:15.269 --> 05:02:19.734]  That's because the goblins are about to ram down the door and 50,000 of them are about to attack you.
[05:02:20.195 --> 05:02:25.941]  So as positive as this is, folks, the sword's glowing because the war has just started.
[05:02:26.684 --> 05:02:27.684]  The Lord of the Rings, right?
[05:02:27.884 --> 05:02:29.285]  They were written, uh, Tolkien.
[05:02:29.605 --> 05:02:29.785]  Yeah.
[05:02:30.145 --> 05:02:31.125]  Um, Christian.
[05:02:31.466 --> 05:02:31.666]  Yes.
[05:02:32.026 --> 05:02:32.206]  Right?
[05:02:32.566 --> 05:02:33.926]  He said it was a whole Christian allegory.
[05:02:33.986 --> 05:02:35.807]  It's all, there's a meaning in all of that.
[05:02:35.907 --> 05:02:38.828]  And so if people can look at that and think, well, I'd really like to be in that.
[05:02:38.868 --> 05:02:39.328]  Well, guess what?
[05:02:39.368 --> 05:02:40.468]  You can right now.
[05:02:40.869 --> 05:02:43.129]  You can, you can be, you're in that he was in world war one.
[05:02:43.469 --> 05:02:44.910]  He was, he was a warrior.
[05:02:44.930 --> 05:02:45.850]  Yeah.
[05:02:46.170 --> 05:02:46.350]  Yeah.
[05:02:46.810 --> 05:02:49.211]  So this, this is, this is real as it gets as real as this.
[05:02:49.251 --> 05:02:51.512]  He said, this is my Christian allegory of how it really works.
[05:02:51.872 --> 05:02:52.232]  Exactly.
[05:02:52.553 --> 05:02:55.556]  Pay attention to it, and then seek it out in the book.
[05:02:56.357 --> 05:03:01.824]  I go back and I look at the Old Testament battle stuff in there, and the New Testament is battle.
[05:03:01.904 --> 05:03:04.106]  It's just the sword is the weapon.
[05:03:05.308 --> 05:03:07.771]  All the archaeologists go find everything the Bible says is there.
[05:03:08.251 --> 05:03:09.371]  Oh yeah, it's confirmed.
[05:03:09.431 --> 05:03:11.312]  And it's in triplicate.
[05:03:11.632 --> 05:03:17.595]  And it's confirmed by the prophecies that took place in the Old Testament that then were fulfilled in Christ.
[05:03:17.875 --> 05:03:20.436]  He didn't come to change the law or to end the law.
[05:03:20.476 --> 05:03:21.736]  But to fulfill it.
[05:03:22.036 --> 05:03:24.997]  Because it's already talked about prophesying that He's coming.
[05:03:25.177 --> 05:03:28.599]  And He was telling the Pharisees, you didn't properly interpret it, I fulfill it.
[05:03:28.759 --> 05:03:30.780]  And the next time He comes, He's coming in on a war horse.
[05:03:32.740 --> 05:03:34.921]  So we've got to be prepared for that because we have to usher that in.
[05:03:35.161 --> 05:03:36.222]  Is it a thousand years from now?
[05:03:36.342 --> 05:03:36.662]  I don't know.
[05:03:38.197 --> 05:03:47.080]  God says, as you know, as you're a theologian, we don't know the hour of the time, but we, it's, there's many Antichrists, but man, Margaret the Beast's world government, I think it's 20 years out.
[05:03:47.100 --> 05:03:49.241]  Yeah, the Antichrist is a spirit.
[05:03:49.501 --> 05:03:50.141]  It definitely is.
[05:03:50.241 --> 05:03:51.041]  It just possesses people.
[05:03:51.081 --> 05:03:51.221]  Right.
[05:03:51.441 --> 05:03:53.642]  It possesses, it oppresses as well.
[05:03:54.402 --> 05:04:01.905]  But you can throw that off, Ricky Bobby, you know, you, you know, I mean, Talladega Knights, don't you put that evil on me, but you can, you can be oppressed as well.
[05:04:02.465 --> 05:04:12.133]  And that's where, when you're making that decision, as you take control of your flesh, and if you don't have control and your flesh is living on top, it's harder to be, it's easier to be oppressed.
[05:04:12.473 --> 05:04:15.976]  I'm going to coin a phrase, you kind of said it, flesh on bottom.
[05:04:16.396 --> 05:04:17.016]  Flesh on bottom.
[05:04:17.217 --> 05:04:21.400]  Because this Holy Spirit is so heavy when it's in the right place.
[05:04:23.582 --> 05:04:27.046]  Absolutely.
[05:04:27.307 --> 05:04:31.612]  It's what I tell my guys on my team.
[05:04:32.012 --> 05:04:32.934]  Guys, there are darts.
[05:04:34.095 --> 05:04:36.057]  We'll call them, for most of my guys, the Spirit of Jezebel.
[05:04:36.077 --> 05:04:37.199]  It's like Pilgrim's Progress.
[05:04:37.379 --> 05:04:37.780]  The darts.
[05:04:37.880 --> 05:04:38.060]  Right.
[05:04:38.120 --> 05:04:40.343]  The darts that take out the noble warriors.
[05:04:41.482 --> 05:04:42.323]  You are noble wars.
[05:04:42.383 --> 05:04:44.004]  All my guys are Christians and they all believe.
[05:04:44.044 --> 05:04:44.664]  Oh, believe me.
[05:04:45.465 --> 05:04:46.606]  But now I see it.
[05:04:46.646 --> 05:04:48.367]  When I was younger, I would take the temptation.
[05:04:48.407 --> 05:04:49.508]  Now I see the demon.
[05:04:49.528 --> 05:04:51.830]  I'm like, yeah, the Jezebel spirits everywhere.
[05:04:51.870 --> 05:05:01.477]  So as soon as you, as you stop allowing those darts to hit you at Achilles heel, let's say in the ankle, then at this point now you've taken control of it.
[05:05:01.497 --> 05:05:02.718]  You, you turn the other way.
[05:05:03.178 --> 05:05:07.621]  Uh, Jerry Clower in the old days, you know, the old comedian from Mississippi run home to mama.
[05:05:07.922 --> 05:05:09.603]  You got, you got to walk away from that stuff.
[05:05:09.863 --> 05:05:10.524]  And that's what.
[05:05:11.144 --> 05:05:12.904]  Because it never ends well.
[05:05:13.124 --> 05:05:13.905]  It never ends well.
[05:05:13.985 --> 05:05:16.305]  You can never get enough sin to be satisfied.
[05:05:16.325 --> 05:05:17.986]  And then what happens to the degenerates?
[05:05:18.766 --> 05:05:20.966]  The more you do it, the more you want.
[05:05:21.206 --> 05:05:23.127]  I only had three women today.
[05:05:23.647 --> 05:05:24.727]  I need seven tomorrow.
[05:05:24.767 --> 05:05:26.588]  Cross a line into degeneracy.
[05:05:27.028 --> 05:05:32.249]  At that point, when you've given yourself and your soul completely to the devil, there's not a lot of hope for you.
[05:05:32.369 --> 05:05:35.730]  I don't say this to act tough or cool, but at like 17 years old,
[05:05:37.844 --> 05:05:41.125]  I was really good looking and everything, and women could not get their hands off me.
[05:05:41.545 --> 05:05:44.826]  I was with like three women a day some days, and I felt so empty.
[05:05:45.106 --> 05:05:47.127]  And literally God came to me and said, stop doing this.
[05:05:47.387 --> 05:05:48.468]  And for years I was celibate.
[05:05:48.848 --> 05:05:49.668]  And then I got married.
[05:05:50.688 --> 05:05:52.429]  People, guys would think, that's really great.
[05:05:52.449 --> 05:05:54.229]  But it wasn't.
[05:05:54.350 --> 05:05:54.950]  It wasn't great.
[05:05:55.470 --> 05:05:58.891]  Most guys think that's really cool to have three women a day when I wanted them.
[05:05:58.971 --> 05:05:59.351]  It wasn't.
[05:05:59.611 --> 05:06:03.112]  What we're taught, you know, as young men, it's not taught by our families.
[05:06:03.192 --> 05:06:04.273]  It's taught by our buddies.
[05:06:04.913 --> 05:06:06.414]  You think about devaluing them?
[05:06:06.454 --> 05:06:08.455]  Well, I don't tell a story that cool.
[05:06:08.475 --> 05:06:09.636]  I tell people I paid for abortion.
[05:06:21.483 --> 05:06:23.164]  I thought I was a Christian and it's not a baby.
[05:06:23.224 --> 05:06:23.884]  I lied to myself.
[05:06:24.204 --> 05:06:25.244]  I've admitted my crimes.
[05:06:25.325 --> 05:06:25.865]  I repented.
[05:06:25.905 --> 05:06:28.866]  God put me on a mission and said, I will forgive you if you go and do this.
[05:06:28.926 --> 05:06:31.307]  And by the way, you're going to get really hurt, but you're going to be forgiven.
[05:06:31.327 --> 05:06:36.689]  I literally was told this by God like 25, 27 years ago, but I've told the stories about the bad things I did.
[05:06:37.409 --> 05:06:40.370]  The left goes, oh, this guy admits he paid for an abortion when he was 16.
[05:06:40.670 --> 05:06:41.190]  He's evil.
[05:06:41.490 --> 05:06:42.630]  No, I'm not agreeing with abortion.
[05:06:42.690 --> 05:06:43.330]  I'm wrong.
[05:06:43.390 --> 05:06:44.210]  I'm saying it was wrong.
[05:06:44.550 --> 05:06:53.912]  But the reason I tell that story is because I've, I've had, not Wilt Chamberlain level stuff, but you know, whatever trick I had or whatever, women will just instantly, whatever.
[05:06:54.412 --> 05:06:57.593]  It was, it was evil and, and literally got super dark.
[05:06:57.673 --> 05:07:02.374]  And it was, I would be sitting there like, go to one woman, the next woman, I had to have more women.
[05:07:02.714 --> 05:07:04.715]  And it felt really, and God's like, stop it.
[05:07:04.755 --> 05:07:06.335]  I felt so good when I quit doing it.
[05:07:06.835 --> 05:07:09.256]  I'm telling people, like most guys think they want all these women.
[05:07:09.316 --> 05:07:10.196]  You don't, guys.
[05:07:10.536 --> 05:07:12.196]  Porn, all of it, it's evil.
[05:07:12.316 --> 05:07:13.136]  It's not real.
[05:07:13.156 --> 05:07:18.398]  Because you're supposed to commit to a woman and have kids and build a world, not just have one woman and go another woman, another woman.
[05:07:18.638 --> 05:07:23.779]  And sure, the women smell that all the women want you, but you're supposed to be a leader of women, not using them.
[05:07:24.079 --> 05:07:25.239]  Right.
[05:07:25.359 --> 05:07:29.700]  There's a certain holiness to a man and a woman, a helpmate, to each other.
[05:07:30.361 --> 05:07:30.541]  Right?
[05:07:30.621 --> 05:07:31.082]  To each other.
[05:07:31.402 --> 05:07:31.703]  Yeah.
[05:07:31.743 --> 05:07:32.384]  Nobody's the boss.
[05:07:32.444 --> 05:07:32.945]  It's a team.
[05:07:32.985 --> 05:07:33.266]  Help me.
[05:07:33.326 --> 05:07:33.726]  It's a team.
[05:07:34.147 --> 05:07:36.671]  And there's something beautiful about that arrangement.
[05:07:37.012 --> 05:07:39.917]  And it's to create the next generation.
[05:07:40.916 --> 05:07:41.456]  Just like us.
[05:08:02.185 --> 05:08:03.586]  Create them in our image.
[05:08:03.626 --> 05:08:05.467]  We will create them in our image.
[05:08:05.507 --> 05:08:08.888]  He's talking about God the Father, the Holy Spirit, and Jesus, right?
[05:08:08.908 --> 05:08:11.549]  And the only reason I tell those horrible stories about myself is because God told me to.
[05:08:12.130 --> 05:08:16.512]  I'm ashamed of that, and I had nightmares about it years ago.
[05:08:16.552 --> 05:08:17.172]  I've gotten over it.
[05:08:17.212 --> 05:08:17.893]  God's forgiven me.
[05:08:17.933 --> 05:08:18.513]  I've moved on.
[05:08:18.533 --> 05:08:20.054]  I only tell bad stories.
[05:08:20.094 --> 05:08:20.614]  I'll let this again.
[05:08:20.634 --> 05:08:21.734]  I'm like, why are you telling a bad story about myself?
[05:08:22.075 --> 05:08:23.215]  Because I've been a sinner.
[05:08:23.255 --> 05:08:23.895]  I've been bad.
[05:08:23.995 --> 05:08:25.356]  I want people to know that I've done evil.
[05:08:26.176 --> 05:08:27.897]  They harden their heart and say, well, screw God.
[05:08:27.917 --> 05:08:30.679]  I don't want to hear the Holy Spirit when it comes and says it's wrong.
[05:08:32.062 --> 05:08:34.903]  If you've still got an inkling of that, the Holy Spirit's still in you.
[05:08:34.923 --> 05:08:36.544]  You haven't gone to the ultimate sin.
[05:08:37.764 --> 05:08:38.745]  Give to God.
[05:08:38.845 --> 05:08:39.705]  Say, I'm sorry.
[05:08:39.865 --> 05:08:40.385]  Heal me.
[05:08:40.405 --> 05:08:40.865]  Humility.
[05:08:40.885 --> 05:08:43.906]  And show me what I'm supposed to do to reverse this.
[05:08:44.007 --> 05:08:45.447]  And God cleared that all out.
[05:08:45.927 --> 05:08:47.948]  So it's, you ask for forgiveness.
[05:08:48.168 --> 05:08:50.109]  You've made a confession to God.
[05:08:50.129 --> 05:08:51.329]  Okay, you've made a confession.
[05:08:51.469 --> 05:08:52.410]  You ask for forgiveness.
[05:08:52.470 --> 05:08:55.191]  And then you repent, which means to turn away from.
[05:08:55.911 --> 05:08:56.071]  Right?
[05:08:56.451 --> 05:08:57.632]  I got three rules on my team.
[05:08:57.672 --> 05:08:58.593]  Number one, Psalm 115.
[05:08:59.033 --> 05:08:59.713]  Not to us, Lord.
[05:08:59.773 --> 05:09:00.394]  Not to us, Lord.
[05:09:00.454 --> 05:09:01.734]  But thy name be the glory.
[05:09:02.215 --> 05:09:03.495]  My guys know this.
[05:09:03.716 --> 05:09:04.516]  God gets all the glory.
[05:09:04.576 --> 05:09:07.037]  Number two, no unrepentant sin on the team.
[05:09:07.498 --> 05:09:07.718]  What?
[05:09:09.359 --> 05:09:10.700]  Doc, boss!
[05:09:10.840 --> 05:09:11.680]  I didn't say no sin.
[05:09:11.740 --> 05:09:13.081]  Jesus would be the only guy on the team.
[05:09:13.341 --> 05:09:14.802]  I said no unrepentant sin.
[05:09:14.922 --> 05:09:16.223]  That means walk away from it.
[05:09:16.543 --> 05:09:21.186]  Yeah, you might bounce back, but as long as you keep coming back to us and let us know, we're all in this balance beam together.
[05:09:21.977 --> 05:09:23.058]  Let's lift each other up.
[05:09:23.078 --> 05:09:23.878]  Yeah, we're not perfect.
[05:09:23.898 --> 05:09:24.058]  Yeah.
[05:09:24.419 --> 05:09:26.080]  And then number three, no cowards.
[05:09:27.361 --> 05:09:28.301]  That's God's number one rule.
[05:09:28.402 --> 05:09:28.802]  That's right.
[05:09:29.162 --> 05:09:31.364]  And the only reason I tell those stories is not to be weak.
[05:09:31.604 --> 05:09:36.267]  God told me, like, admit you did this to people because they're listening.
[05:09:36.287 --> 05:09:41.070]  They need to know that it's because I remember my dad when I was like 18, right out of high school.
[05:09:41.371 --> 05:09:42.672]  It was like a week after high school.
[05:09:42.692 --> 05:09:43.552]  I'll finish the story and you can go.
[05:09:43.692 --> 05:09:43.993]  Yeah, yeah.
[05:09:44.153 --> 05:09:44.493]  No, we're good.
[05:09:44.793 --> 05:09:48.575]  And my dad didn't sneak around and look at my stuff, but I was lazy.
[05:09:49.415 --> 05:09:58.539]  And they were out of town, and I took this, you know, like, I was like 18, like 25 year old woman up, and used my parents' bed in the house, and all this stuff, and she left stuff.
[05:09:58.819 --> 05:10:02.841]  And they get there, and the woman literally sits there and talks to my mom in the kitchen.
[05:10:03.801 --> 05:10:09.964]  And then my dad's sitting there looking, because my wallet's on the coffee table, and he sees an abortion slip.
[05:10:10.922 --> 05:10:17.487]  That I guess from this woman had given me or whatever, from like months before, and my dad said, you get out of my house right now.
[05:10:18.708 --> 05:10:20.069]  We don't kill our grandchildren.
[05:10:20.749 --> 05:10:21.770]  You need to repent to God.
[05:10:21.830 --> 05:10:22.631]  This is sick.
[05:10:23.011 --> 05:10:26.754]  And I said, Dad, I've been doing, I didn't, you know, he said, get out of here.
[05:10:26.774 --> 05:10:28.195]  And they threw me out the next day.
[05:10:28.675 --> 05:10:32.318]  And my dad's not an aggressive mean guy, but they were like, you get your shit, you get out of here right now.
[05:10:32.678 --> 05:10:34.580]  And my dad said, I'm going to pray to God you repent from this.
[05:10:34.820 --> 05:10:35.801]  Stop killing my grandchildren.
[05:10:36.221 --> 05:10:42.604]  And I literally thought back like, well, they say it's not a kid, it's a blob of cells, but it was like, and I literally had nightmares for months about it.
[05:10:42.644 --> 05:10:43.264]  I moved out.
[05:10:43.645 --> 05:10:44.405]  It was this big thing.
[05:10:44.445 --> 05:10:50.728]  And for years, I just, like two, three years with any women, and met my wife, who I had three children with, all that stuff.
[05:10:51.028 --> 05:10:55.510]  But it was literally my dad with the authority said, don't kill my grandchildren anymore.
[05:10:55.530 --> 05:10:58.312]  And the only reason I tell that story is, you've killed your children.
[05:10:58.392 --> 05:10:59.712]  You didn't know like I didn't know.
[05:10:59.932 --> 05:11:00.693]  I figured it out.
[05:11:00.713 --> 05:11:01.633]  My dad called me out.
[05:11:02.053 --> 05:11:02.694]  I stopped it.
[05:11:02.954 --> 05:11:05.035]  And I literally got my mission a few years after that.
[05:11:06.136 --> 05:11:13.144]  And that is God's creation.
[05:11:13.425 --> 05:11:14.526]  That's not your creation.
[05:11:14.766 --> 05:11:15.767]  That's God's creation.
[05:11:16.168 --> 05:11:17.229]  That's the next generation.
[05:11:17.670 --> 05:11:19.452]  Because what do we want as the next generation?
[05:11:19.592 --> 05:11:19.953]  AI?
[05:11:20.453 --> 05:11:22.315]  Or do we want some kind of transhuman thing?
[05:11:22.416 --> 05:11:24.838]  Or some kind of trans person to be the next generation?
[05:11:25.379 --> 05:11:26.579]  Well, that's it.
[05:11:26.780 --> 05:11:30.221]  I would die today, no question, for any of my four children.
[05:11:30.781 --> 05:11:33.202]  And I look back at at least ten children I murdered.
[05:11:33.462 --> 05:11:34.922]  And I say this, not to build myself up.
[05:11:34.942 --> 05:11:36.243]  People say, why is he doing this?
[05:11:36.543 --> 05:11:38.423]  No, I have nightmares still.
[05:11:38.804 --> 05:11:41.424]  I literally, I would do anything for my children.
[05:11:41.444 --> 05:11:44.866]  They are the most, I would literally cut my arms off if they told me.
[05:11:44.886 --> 05:11:46.846]  I would take a freaking meat cleaver to my face.
[05:11:47.306 --> 05:11:50.167]  And I literally was deceived in a daze.
[05:11:50.548 --> 05:11:52.368]  And just to have women, women, women, women.
[05:11:52.608 --> 05:11:53.709]  They'd say, I need 300 bucks.
[05:11:53.749 --> 05:11:54.389]  Boom, boom, boom.
[05:11:56.150 --> 05:11:58.991]  But when I was finally convicted, my dad called me out.
[05:11:59.611 --> 05:12:00.352]  It was the change.
[05:12:00.392 --> 05:12:02.293]  So I don't say that to make myself sound big.
[05:12:02.353 --> 05:12:02.873]  I'm bad.
[05:12:03.133 --> 05:12:04.234]  But God forgave me.
[05:12:04.274 --> 05:12:06.094]  That's what I'm trying to tell people, is you can be forgiven.
[05:12:06.395 --> 05:12:07.175]  God forgave you.
[05:12:07.255 --> 05:12:10.116]  God forgave Paul and made him one of the apostles.
[05:12:10.717 --> 05:12:11.917]  Paul killed Christians.
[05:12:12.297 --> 05:12:12.858]  He was Saul.
[05:12:13.038 --> 05:12:16.740]  And they changed his name after he went blind and then he had eyes to see.
[05:12:16.760 --> 05:12:18.440]  So, Saul of Tarsus.
[05:12:18.861 --> 05:12:19.441]  Saul of Tarsus.
[05:12:20.066 --> 05:12:20.186]  Yeah.
[05:12:20.726 --> 05:12:22.847]  I want to tell this story again because it's real.
[05:12:22.907 --> 05:12:23.968]  That was my experience.
[05:12:24.308 --> 05:12:30.031]  But it took the authority of my dad on Earth, that's what God got, to say, don't you ever kill my grandkids again.
[05:12:30.131 --> 05:12:31.412]  Get the fuck out of my house.
[05:12:32.148 --> 05:12:33.689]  And he has the authority to do that as your father.
[05:12:34.169 --> 05:12:35.370]  And so do we with our children.
[05:12:35.390 --> 05:12:36.931]  We have the authority to do that.
[05:12:37.011 --> 05:12:40.153]  But out of love, out of love is why he did that.
[05:12:40.694 --> 05:12:43.055]  Because he loved those children.
[05:12:43.595 --> 05:12:44.136]  He was crying.
[05:12:44.156 --> 05:12:44.796]  He was crying.
[05:12:45.216 --> 05:12:45.397]  Yeah.
[05:12:45.877 --> 05:12:48.579]  But you've been forgiven of that because that's what Jesus' blood is about.
[05:12:48.899 --> 05:12:49.699]  That's the atonement.
[05:12:50.000 --> 05:12:52.021]  That's the reclamation of those things.
[05:12:52.421 --> 05:12:54.141]  I agree, but you said faith without works is dead.
[05:12:54.161 --> 05:12:59.642]  I'm not the Bible scholar you are, but then when I repented of that, I got rebuilt, then God said, now here's your mission.
[05:12:59.903 --> 05:13:00.543]  Now here's your mission.
[05:13:00.723 --> 05:13:16.966]  Right, because now you are on a focus where it's not yourself, it's not InfoWars, it's the kingdom, and it's doing what's right for the kingdom, which is to protect this republic, this constitutional republic right now, so that we don't continue to destroy the human race.
[05:13:17.546 --> 05:13:20.147]  And that's what the Bible talks about, is the principalities.
[05:13:20.407 --> 05:13:22.649]  But God has His command order, so does the enemy.
[05:13:23.409 --> 05:13:23.989]  Absolutely.
[05:13:24.069 --> 05:13:27.391]  Everything we do, we think we invented, no, is a copy of what's actually going on.
[05:13:28.411 --> 05:13:32.053]  Satan has his generals and his colonels and his sergeants.
[05:13:32.073 --> 05:13:32.753]  There's a hierarchy.
[05:13:32.793 --> 05:13:33.674]  Those are principalities.
[05:13:34.274 --> 05:13:35.735]  Over Texas, there's a principality.
[05:13:36.987 --> 05:13:38.708]  Over the oil business, there's a principality.
[05:13:38.828 --> 05:13:41.209]  Over the porn business, there's a principality.
[05:13:41.309 --> 05:13:44.130]  Over the banking system, there's a principality.
[05:13:44.170 --> 05:13:46.911]  But we have the authorities to pray.
[05:13:48.371 --> 05:13:50.472]  We could send legions of angels if we wanted to.
[05:13:50.512 --> 05:13:51.112]  We could say that.
[05:13:51.152 --> 05:13:53.153]  We could all collectively pray that.
[05:13:53.313 --> 05:13:54.774]  And use that Special Forces analogy.
[05:13:54.834 --> 05:13:58.595]  We're like the Special Forces calling in the airstrikes, but we don't use the power.
[05:13:59.135 --> 05:14:01.396]  That's why they wanted to shut down the churches during COVID.
[05:14:01.636 --> 05:14:02.936]  Because we have the airstrikes.
[05:14:02.997 --> 05:14:04.137]  We can call the airstrikes in.
[05:14:05.615 --> 05:14:12.864]  I was at the Takoa, Georgia, and I'm reading this thing about General George S. Patton.
[05:14:14.246 --> 05:14:15.167]  The Battle of the Bulge.
[05:14:15.988 --> 05:14:16.669]  They were surrounded.
[05:14:16.709 --> 05:14:18.771]  That's the 101st at the Battle of the Bulge.
[05:14:19.091 --> 05:14:20.093]  The Currahee boys.
[05:14:20.717 --> 05:14:21.377]  They're surrounded.
[05:14:21.397 --> 05:14:22.698]  They have no way out.
[05:14:23.038 --> 05:14:23.959]  Patton can't get to them.
[05:14:24.159 --> 05:14:24.639]  It's snow.
[05:14:24.900 --> 05:14:26.301]  He doesn't have any logistics supply.
[05:14:26.561 --> 05:14:30.143]  He goes to the chaplain and says, I need you to give me a prayer so we can win this battle.
[05:14:30.163 --> 05:14:31.844]  And the chaplain says, I can't do that.
[05:14:32.284 --> 05:14:33.645]  I don't pray war stuff.
[05:14:33.685 --> 05:14:34.426]  He goes, you're fired.
[05:14:34.446 --> 05:14:35.246]  Give me the next chaplain.
[05:14:35.546 --> 05:14:36.887]  Next chaplain says, I'll do a prayer.
[05:14:37.267 --> 05:14:41.330]  Collectively, he gives it to the divisions and says, all of you boys pray this at the same time.
[05:14:41.750 --> 05:14:42.351]  Corporate prayer.
[05:14:42.391 --> 05:14:43.052]  He knew the power.
[05:14:43.252 --> 05:14:44.313]  He knew the power of prayer.
[05:14:44.654 --> 05:14:45.214]  And what happened?
[05:14:45.514 --> 05:14:47.016]  They busted through the bulge.
[05:14:47.076 --> 05:14:48.538]  The battling bastards of Bastogne.
[05:14:48.818 --> 05:14:52.903]  They busted through the bulge on December the 25th when they started fighting at Christmas.
[05:14:53.383 --> 05:14:54.885]  They're in there during Christmas time.
[05:14:54.905 --> 05:14:57.388]  I don't know what day specifically they broke out from that.
[05:14:57.668 --> 05:14:58.809]  December 24th, I read it, yeah.
[05:14:58.929 --> 05:15:07.554]  Right, and so then you get all the resupply comes in, the clouds open up, the planes are flying, right, so they can do sorties, close air support.
[05:15:07.654 --> 05:15:09.015]  On Christmas Day, they start killing them.
[05:15:09.035 --> 05:15:10.756]  They start strafing and they start killing them.
[05:15:10.776 --> 05:15:11.997]  To go all the way to Berlin after that.
[05:15:12.759 --> 05:15:13.720]  From a power of prayer.
[05:15:14.280 --> 05:15:15.040]  That's the important thing.
[05:15:15.060 --> 05:15:15.981]  Because Patton knew.
[05:15:16.381 --> 05:15:19.503]  So are we not in that position right now where we are completely surrounded?
[05:15:19.803 --> 05:15:21.844]  Look, me on that border, you know what I'm surrounded by?
[05:15:22.144 --> 05:15:25.126]  Cartels to the south and mainstream media to the north.
[05:15:25.906 --> 05:15:28.828]  Or the corporatocracies.
[05:15:28.968 --> 05:15:31.009]  But George Washington prayed constantly.
[05:15:31.109 --> 05:15:32.590]  What real general doesn't?
[05:15:33.391 --> 05:15:34.812]  George Washington prayed constantly.
[05:15:34.912 --> 05:15:35.432]  Ceasingly.
[05:15:36.209 --> 05:15:36.469]  He did.
[05:15:36.489 --> 05:15:46.156]  Yeah, his wife prayed for him on a rock there at Fredericksburg where the Battle of Fredericksburg took place, on a rock that was hit by a shell from the north when it was firing at the south.
[05:15:46.777 --> 05:16:05.371]  It hit, think about that, from the Revolutionary War, George Washington's wife prayed at a rock at Fredericksburg, and then at the Battle of Fredericksburg in 1864 or something, I think around that time, 1776 to 1864, a shell hits it from the north and says, now there's a crack in that rock.
[05:16:06.425 --> 05:16:08.346]  There's a significance to all these things.
[05:16:08.666 --> 05:16:09.126]  A revelation.
[05:16:09.146 --> 05:16:09.947]  God keeps showing us.
[05:16:10.127 --> 05:16:10.947]  He keeps showing us.
[05:16:11.208 --> 05:16:16.370]  Like you walk in and you go, uh, the Alamo, and they already, as you say it, it goes on screen.
[05:16:16.390 --> 05:16:17.211]  They never even play that.
[05:16:17.471 --> 05:16:23.474]  Yeah, I can't, I can't fathom, I don't understand how that works, but it's, that's because you have eyes to see.
[05:16:23.754 --> 05:16:24.135]  You saw it.
[05:16:24.815 --> 05:16:25.596]  That's what that's called.
[05:16:25.977 --> 05:16:26.778]  You see these things.
[05:16:27.039 --> 05:16:32.687]  When I'm driving down the road and I see a cross and I saw a cross like that out in where it was Alabama.
[05:16:33.068 --> 05:16:33.749]  It's exactly the same.
[05:16:33.789 --> 05:16:34.650]  Then I saw the third one.
[05:16:35.131 --> 05:16:36.994]  We start seeing these things and there's patterns.
[05:16:37.635 --> 05:16:39.798]  God is a God of order, not of chaos.
[05:16:40.714 --> 05:16:41.794]  God's order is incredible.
[05:16:41.834 --> 05:16:42.394]  It's all order.
[05:16:42.775 --> 05:16:43.135]  It's order.
[05:16:43.355 --> 05:16:44.895]  And you see these patterns and you start seeing it.
[05:16:44.915 --> 05:16:47.076]  He gives us our children, our wives, our people.
[05:16:47.136 --> 05:16:48.156]  It's all awesome.
[05:16:48.176 --> 05:16:50.297]  I mean, it's like, wow, you're really awesome.
[05:16:50.657 --> 05:16:52.377]  And the devil acts like he runs the planet.
[05:16:52.437 --> 05:16:53.237]  God gave us all this.
[05:16:53.357 --> 05:16:53.978]  Devil's chaos.
[05:16:54.238 --> 05:16:54.418]  All right.
[05:16:54.438 --> 05:16:55.518]  How will people find you online?
[05:16:55.538 --> 05:16:56.198]  I'm going to go home.
[05:16:56.938 --> 05:16:59.279]  Dr. Pete Chambers dot com.
[05:16:59.319 --> 05:17:01.340]  Dr. Pete Chambers dot com.
[05:17:01.420 --> 05:17:05.941]  There's a page there with all the lines of effort and I need help down range.
[05:17:06.061 --> 05:17:06.541]  We need your help.
[05:17:06.801 --> 05:17:10.444]  I don't know the military term for this, but some people try to spin it like, oh, it's not that bad.
[05:17:10.524 --> 05:17:15.108]  No, if you're under assault, you tell people you're under assault, you back it off, it doesn't mean there was an assault.
[05:17:15.529 --> 05:17:19.532]  They tried to shut it down Friday and Saturday, and it's going to be so proven to people, because I...
[05:17:20.404 --> 05:17:23.085]  Well, all the stuff going on, it would take an hour to extravigate.
[05:17:23.125 --> 05:17:24.125]  I think we're shutting down in a month.
[05:17:24.385 --> 05:17:25.345]  I've already told the crew this.
[05:17:25.646 --> 05:17:26.786]  We're taking stuff off the walls.
[05:17:26.826 --> 05:17:27.886]  We're getting our stuff out of here.
[05:17:28.246 --> 05:17:28.987]  We're not giving up.
[05:17:29.107 --> 05:17:30.147]  Just the court can do it.
[05:17:30.187 --> 05:17:31.507]  I'm not going to buck the federal court.
[05:17:31.987 --> 05:17:36.669]  But they did it early for whatever reason, because I could have a stalling effort.
[05:17:37.449 --> 05:17:38.010]  We're good to go.
[05:17:54.545 --> 05:18:00.690]  There's like a normalcy bias where people keep winning and we keep, like they think, oh Jones didn't go anywhere.
[05:18:00.990 --> 05:18:02.872]  Not Alex Jones has survived all this.
[05:18:03.312 --> 05:18:06.955]  It's like your grandpa that's beaten cancer three times and finally he's dead and you can't believe it.
[05:18:07.335 --> 05:18:10.218]  I need to explain, we're down to the wire, people.
[05:18:10.558 --> 05:18:12.519]  This is... I have a term for that.
[05:18:12.559 --> 05:18:12.880]  What is it?
[05:18:13.200 --> 05:18:15.382]  The term for that is we are decisively engaged.
[05:18:16.282 --> 05:18:27.946]  If you're an infantryman and you're in a foxhole and your commander tells you you are decisively engaged, that means you can't move forward, there's no reinforcements coming for you like the Battle of the Bulge, and then when you go black on ammo, you're going to be fixing bayonets.
[05:18:28.266 --> 05:18:30.047]  America, we are decisively engaged.
[05:18:30.547 --> 05:18:31.147]  Decisively.
[05:18:31.367 --> 05:18:31.748]  Exactly!
[05:18:31.788 --> 05:18:32.588]  I'm down to bayonets!
[05:18:33.288 --> 05:18:36.672]  And because I just won the last round, they're like, well, son, you're winning.
[05:18:36.692 --> 05:18:39.154]  I just got to overrun, beat this for a few hours.
[05:18:39.575 --> 05:18:41.577]  And I'm literally here with smoke around me.
[05:18:41.857 --> 05:18:45.741]  And these people that aren't engaged, like, look at me and go, oh, that's a fucking act.
[05:18:45.902 --> 05:18:47.743]  Like, man, it ain't an act, dude.
[05:18:47.784 --> 05:18:49.065]  No, there's no act about this guy.
[05:18:49.085 --> 05:18:50.326]  I've seen him offstage and on it.
[05:18:50.506 --> 05:18:50.987]  There's no act.
[05:18:51.067 --> 05:18:55.690]  But I'm not even trying to, I can't believe the enemy put that out and some people bought it.
[05:18:55.750 --> 05:18:57.231]  Like, this is happening.
[05:18:57.511 --> 05:18:58.572]  Like, it's ridiculous.
[05:18:58.832 --> 05:18:59.812]  Did they indict Trump?
[05:19:00.012 --> 05:19:00.873]  Did they convict him?
[05:19:01.193 --> 05:19:02.354]  Is the border wide open?
[05:19:02.554 --> 05:19:03.795]  Is there drag queens sporting time?
[05:19:03.975 --> 05:19:05.156]  We're about to have nuclear war with Russia?
[05:19:05.436 --> 05:19:07.177]  It's going down, people!
[05:19:07.497 --> 05:19:08.457]  It ain't about me.
[05:19:08.578 --> 05:19:09.818]  I'm not even worried about this.
[05:19:10.579 --> 05:19:12.220]  I know we're in such danger.
[05:19:12.240 --> 05:19:15.102]  I'm literally just like, God, God's in charge.
[05:19:15.162 --> 05:19:16.062]  God, tell me what to do.
[05:19:16.342 --> 05:19:17.263]  Because I have children.
[05:19:17.283 --> 05:19:18.604]  I have a seven-year-old daughter.
[05:19:19.404 --> 05:19:25.107]  And I've got older kids, it's weird when they get older they don't worry about it as much, but still, like the little ones you get really upset about.
[05:19:25.507 --> 05:19:29.048]  And I'm just like, people, you need to recognize you're in a war!
[05:19:29.408 --> 05:19:30.269]  This is real!
[05:19:30.769 --> 05:19:31.629]  It's as real as it gets.
[05:19:32.030 --> 05:19:32.470]  We are at war.
[05:19:32.510 --> 05:19:36.872]  You know, the first war started when Adam and Eve gave in to the snake.
[05:19:37.312 --> 05:19:39.273]  That was the first war, spiritual war.
[05:19:39.873 --> 05:19:40.654]  And it hasn't changed.
[05:19:41.174 --> 05:19:46.857]  We could have third, we're at the third world war or whatever right now, or the Cold War was the third world war and we're going into the fourth world war.
[05:19:46.937 --> 05:19:47.757]  The war's never ended.
[05:19:47.977 --> 05:19:48.958]  It's the extenuation of the last world war.
[05:19:48.978 --> 05:19:49.418]  It's chaos.
[05:19:49.498 --> 05:19:50.338]  That's what the devil's doing.
[05:19:50.358 --> 05:19:50.779]  It's chaos.
[05:19:50.819 --> 05:19:55.701]  And so, we have to just accept that, but we have to take a knee face out and pull security.
[05:19:55.781 --> 05:19:57.762]  I mean, that's what we say, but it's what we have to do.
[05:19:57.842 --> 05:19:59.043]  We protect each other.
[05:19:59.643 --> 05:20:06.851]  These little groups that I talk to in Texas, six now, six groups, six areas where they have parallel systems that are going to survive.
[05:20:07.511 --> 05:20:08.573]  People are getting it fast.
[05:20:08.853 --> 05:20:09.714]  Yeah, they're getting it.
[05:20:10.814 --> 05:20:10.994]  Yeah.
[05:20:11.254 --> 05:20:13.536]  And what's great is the military's listening.
[05:20:14.456 --> 05:20:16.318]  I met with federal judges, high level, others.
[05:20:16.578 --> 05:20:18.239]  I don't want to kiss the government's ass.
[05:20:18.259 --> 05:20:18.739]  I'm not doing that.
[05:20:19.119 --> 05:20:20.520]  But you think the government's all bad.
[05:20:20.560 --> 05:20:21.081]  It's not your enemy.
[05:20:21.141 --> 05:20:22.462]  It's hijacked to the top.
[05:20:22.842 --> 05:20:29.206]  But even top federal judges and all these other people are compartmentalized because they put the good guys on the side jobs.
[05:20:29.526 --> 05:20:30.527]  They are completely freaked out.
[05:20:31.263 --> 05:20:34.926]  Yeah, that's what they do to any critical thinker in my institution, the Department of Defense.
[05:20:34.966 --> 05:20:41.712]  But you've got 231 military people that stood up and signed a declaration of military accountability saying, no MAS.
[05:20:41.772 --> 05:20:46.036]  And in January the 1st of this year, at 0400 hours, it went to the Joint Chiefs.
[05:20:46.557 --> 05:20:52.302]  They started coming after us for subversion and sabotage, not sabotage, in the Navy we would call it a mutiny.
[05:20:52.762 --> 05:20:55.585]  Because you said, there's accountability to be had here.
[05:20:56.505 --> 05:20:58.066]  Exactly, I know about that.
[05:20:58.086 --> 05:21:03.009]  What I'm saying is, and now they're begging the Tribs back, like you that got hurt by shots, the others that refused.
[05:21:03.590 --> 05:21:05.131]  They're begging them back right now.
[05:21:06.512 --> 05:21:08.273]  And, you know, once bitten twice shy.
[05:21:08.293 --> 05:21:08.993]  We're not going to take it.
[05:21:09.033 --> 05:21:09.934]  We're not going to go back in.
[05:21:10.994 --> 05:21:13.196]  Worst recruiting and retention since before 1973.
[05:21:14.636 --> 05:21:19.900]  When you focus on DEI and transgender issues and not war fighting, closing with and destroying the enemy.
[05:21:20.663 --> 05:21:21.504]  Why would you join that?
[05:21:21.584 --> 05:21:26.189]  And they want to start a war with Russia with a bunch of blue-haired, pink-haired dickheads.
[05:21:26.730 --> 05:21:27.571]  Right.
[05:21:27.671 --> 05:21:29.413]  They're not going to fight their way out of a paper bag.
[05:21:30.394 --> 05:21:31.496]  But we are still here.
[05:21:32.297 --> 05:21:36.702]  We've got a trained generation that's done 20 years of war.
[05:21:37.699 --> 05:21:38.961]  And that's what they're so afraid of.
[05:21:39.041 --> 05:21:39.802]  Where do we need to be?
[05:21:39.842 --> 05:21:41.464]  We need to be continental United States.
[05:21:42.005 --> 05:21:47.933]  Because the Japanese would not attack this country in World War II because behind every bush was an American with a gun.
[05:21:48.033 --> 05:21:48.914]  Admiral Yamamoto.
[05:21:49.194 --> 05:21:49.675]  Absolutely.
[05:21:49.695 --> 05:21:51.718]  Behind every blade of glass is an American rifle.
[05:21:51.918 --> 05:21:52.218]  That's right.
[05:21:52.919 --> 05:21:56.302]  Well, we want to use the Infowar ahead of that, and I know you're clear on that.
[05:21:56.783 --> 05:22:04.130]  We're winning, no violence, but if they try to do new martial law and force injections and roundups, which is the plan, then all bets are off.
[05:22:04.690 --> 05:22:10.916]  And my biggest thing to everybody is I'm not going to sit here and try to play warfighter with people, but the FBI buildings don't bomb them.
[05:22:10.976 --> 05:22:12.097]  The local cops don't kill them.
[05:22:13.038 --> 05:22:15.560]  If civil war goes down, you know who the new world order is.
[05:22:15.620 --> 05:22:17.222]  It's the top card deck.
[05:22:17.522 --> 05:22:18.663]  It's like 50 people, folks.
[05:22:19.024 --> 05:22:19.984]  And I don't want that to happen.
[05:22:20.325 --> 05:22:25.950]  But they need to know, they've tried to line up the civil war like we're all just going to kill each other in black and white and all this bullshit.
[05:22:26.951 --> 05:22:28.352]  If it goes down, you want to speak to that?
[05:22:28.672 --> 05:22:29.413]  Yeah, absolutely.
[05:22:29.473 --> 05:22:37.740]  So, you know, those institutions that are not morally, completely morally bankrupt, the FBI, the CIA, all those, there are good people still there.
[05:22:37.780 --> 05:22:38.241]  I know them.
[05:22:38.741 --> 05:22:38.961]  Right?
[05:22:39.382 --> 05:22:40.342]  But they're not at the top.
[05:22:40.462 --> 05:22:45.885]  So when they say something, and they're just waiting to retire, that's kind of a sin of omission.
[05:22:45.945 --> 05:22:51.509]  So those people, I would reach out to you and say, hey, help do the job from the inside there to turn it back around.
[05:22:51.829 --> 05:22:52.710]  Because we pray for you.
[05:22:53.030 --> 05:22:53.330]  We do.
[05:22:53.410 --> 05:22:54.951]  I pray for you to have power.
[05:22:55.972 --> 05:22:56.892]  You have courage.
[05:22:57.212 --> 05:22:57.893]  Moral courage.
[05:22:58.093 --> 05:23:01.675]  That you are able to stand up and stand in the gap, do the right thing, when nobody's watching.
[05:23:02.375 --> 05:23:04.497]  And I use the analogy of Hitler.
[05:23:05.257 --> 05:23:07.538]  His general staff were bad guys.
[05:23:07.939 --> 05:23:10.920]  But two years before they saw Germany was going to lose, they tried to get rid of Hitler.
[05:23:11.280 --> 05:23:14.362]  Guys, can you not get... and there's not one guy to get rid of.
[05:23:14.422 --> 05:23:15.002]  It's a system.
[05:23:15.022 --> 05:23:15.863]  That's why it's so powerful.
[05:23:17.119 --> 05:23:19.360]  Can't they get this is not going somewhere well?
[05:23:19.700 --> 05:23:21.421]  They need to just politically have courage.
[05:23:21.441 --> 05:23:22.221]  We don't need a war.
[05:23:22.241 --> 05:23:24.321]  They've just got to start blowing the whistle.
[05:23:24.782 --> 05:23:25.582]  Just start standing up.
[05:23:25.782 --> 05:23:28.683]  I mean, it's what's happening in the military right now.
[05:23:28.743 --> 05:23:30.944]  It's just we still got the Obama generals in there.
[05:23:31.384 --> 05:23:32.084]  They're coming out.
[05:23:32.124 --> 05:23:34.205]  The lieutenant colonels and above are starting to move up.
[05:23:34.705 --> 05:23:35.745]  And we're starting to see.
[05:23:35.985 --> 05:23:37.106]  So Trump got some people in.
[05:23:37.646 --> 05:23:39.648]  Absolutely, yeah.
[05:23:39.988 --> 05:23:43.531]  Unfortunately, the Obama generals were the ones that were running things.
[05:23:43.992 --> 05:23:44.913]  The Millies and all those.
[05:23:45.053 --> 05:23:46.714]  We are still holding accountable.
[05:23:47.175 --> 05:23:52.960]  I don't want to keep interrupting, but what I'm trying to say is, we don't want violence.
[05:23:53.380 --> 05:23:54.581]  We're winning the info war.
[05:23:54.641 --> 05:23:55.682]  The enemy wants it.
[05:23:56.043 --> 05:23:59.366]  My main message is, no, do not be roped into something.
[05:23:59.386 --> 05:24:01.087]  Because clearly, I think false flags are what's coming.
[05:24:01.167 --> 05:24:04.030]  Yeah, they poked Bubba in the eye enough times, and he's going to do something stupid.
[05:24:04.591 --> 05:24:07.593]  You've got to measure three times, cut once, understand the battlefield.
[05:24:07.633 --> 05:24:09.835]  You've got to understand your situational awareness.
[05:24:09.875 --> 05:24:14.218]  You're not just going to go out there and start doing things against an organization or an institution.
[05:24:14.578 --> 05:24:22.184]  You need to focus on your local, your inner and outer rings of security, like our towns, neighborhood watch programs.
[05:24:22.204 --> 05:24:22.544]  Exactly.
[05:24:22.644 --> 05:24:23.485]  Stop crime.
[05:24:23.525 --> 05:24:24.346]  That's the real attack.
[05:24:24.986 --> 05:24:27.750]  Neighborhood Watch program essentially on steroids, because it's Texas.
[05:24:28.131 --> 05:24:35.081]  And then you're right, don't even call a militia, those constitutionalists will say, oh, Neighborhood Watch, have a barbecue, we're all together, in case things get bad, and now you've got everybody.
[05:24:36.454 --> 05:24:40.676]  A well-maintained militia is authorized in the Constitution, but what are they doing in the Constitution right now?
[05:24:41.236 --> 05:24:42.997]  I'm saying they even spin it.
[05:24:43.337 --> 05:24:45.738]  I'd call it neighborhood watch and then get the people in.
[05:24:45.838 --> 05:24:49.339]  Oh yeah, that's what we've been doing and they're doing a fine job of it.
[05:24:49.639 --> 05:24:54.361]  Look, we've learned how to raise bees and canned goods.
[05:24:54.581 --> 05:24:56.161]  We've learned how to do that because we have to survive.
[05:24:56.181 --> 05:24:57.842]  And you're right, bigger than bullets is food.
[05:24:58.904 --> 05:25:00.124]  Everybody wants to shoot their mouth off.
[05:25:00.184 --> 05:25:01.325]  I'm going to go out when the U.N.
[05:25:01.345 --> 05:25:01.825]  helmets come.
[05:25:02.025 --> 05:25:02.865]  They don't come as U.N.
[05:25:02.885 --> 05:25:03.085]  helmets.
[05:25:03.105 --> 05:25:04.386]  They've got your federal government.
[05:25:04.846 --> 05:25:08.487]  You've got to take care of your kids, raise food, be ready.
[05:25:08.587 --> 05:25:10.027]  Permaculture is a thing.
[05:25:10.167 --> 05:25:11.768]  Permaculture design is a thing.
[05:25:11.808 --> 05:25:19.510]  Growing your victory garden, so to speak, but using a permaculture design, there is, I mean, you can grow your own food enough to get through it.
[05:25:19.530 --> 05:25:20.250]  And that's real war.
[05:25:21.050 --> 05:25:22.391]  That's real war.
[05:25:22.411 --> 05:25:25.294]  War is being self-sufficient, and then the guns are the backup.
[05:25:25.795 --> 05:25:25.975]  Right.
[05:25:26.476 --> 05:25:31.280]  Because, as you see, the deer population, we see what's happening to chickens, we see all these things, these attacks.
[05:25:31.741 --> 05:25:33.242]  And that's all food, that's all sustenance.
[05:25:33.262 --> 05:25:34.163]  They're poisoning everything.
[05:25:34.423 --> 05:25:37.567]  They poisoned the chicken food three years ago, now they're going to poison the beef.
[05:25:38.087 --> 05:25:38.267]  Right.
[05:25:38.748 --> 05:25:43.552]  But if we see that, refuse the stuff and start with local farmers, suddenly there's a whole new industry.
[05:25:43.592 --> 05:25:44.873]  That's what they're scared of.
[05:25:44.893 --> 05:25:44.873]  100%.
[05:25:45.253 --> 05:25:45.533]  That's it.
[05:25:45.653 --> 05:25:47.175]  Because we don't want you to be self-sufficient.
[05:25:47.495 --> 05:25:52.239]  Well, Doc Chambers, you are a smart guy, and I'm so blessed you came here, and sorry I made you wait an hour.
[05:25:52.259 --> 05:25:53.080]  No, I'm here.
[05:25:53.780 --> 05:25:54.241]  Come back.
[05:25:54.361 --> 05:25:55.161]  It's so good to see you.
[05:25:55.201 --> 05:25:57.103]  The crew's been here for three days.
[05:25:57.643 --> 05:25:58.724]  I made them sleep here last night.
[05:26:00.126 --> 05:26:02.507]  And I don't even tell our enemies what we're going to do.
[05:26:02.968 --> 05:26:04.489]  I'm going to go sleep on the couch again.
[05:26:04.969 --> 05:26:06.590]  So, that's how it is.
[05:26:06.991 --> 05:26:07.931]  So thank you, brother.
[05:26:07.951 --> 05:26:09.873]  I'm going to be asleep in like two minutes.
[05:26:10.353 --> 05:26:11.254]  Thank you so much.
[05:26:11.314 --> 05:26:12.535]  I'm finally ready to hit the sack.
[05:26:12.875 --> 05:26:13.656]  God bless you, brother.
[05:26:13.676 --> 05:26:14.917]  It's so good to know great Americans like you.
[05:26:16.057 --> 05:26:17.038]  DrJonesNationals.com.
[05:26:17.078 --> 05:26:18.179]  How do they find your website?
[05:26:18.559 --> 05:26:19.960]  DrPeteChambers.com.
[05:26:20.100 --> 05:26:23.063]  P-E-T-E Chambers with an S. And DrJonesNationals.com.
[05:26:23.083 --> 05:26:24.384]  If you support us, that's where we're at.
[05:26:25.270 --> 05:26:30.133]  And I don't want us to shut down, but there's a good chance you're all going to get proven wrong that we're not being shut down.
[05:26:30.214 --> 05:26:33.776]  So, to all of you who got paid to say that, everybody needs to know who you are.
[05:26:34.056 --> 05:26:34.757]  Thank you, Doc Chambers.
[05:26:34.777 --> 05:26:35.357]  I love your dog.
[05:26:35.377 --> 05:26:36.318]  What's your dog's name again?
[05:26:36.358 --> 05:26:37.258]  His name is Joe.
[05:26:37.579 --> 05:26:39.000]  Joe!
[05:26:39.340 --> 05:26:39.780]  Good boy.
[05:26:40.881 --> 05:26:41.582]  What kind of dog is he?
[05:26:41.622 --> 05:26:42.422]  He's a Dutch Shepherd.
[05:26:42.782 --> 05:26:43.643]  Those are the best, huh?
[05:26:43.663 --> 05:26:44.063]  The Dutchie.
[05:26:45.364 --> 05:26:46.025]  You're good.
[05:26:46.745 --> 05:26:47.386]  He like me or not?
[05:26:47.586 --> 05:26:47.986]  He likes you.
[05:26:48.106 --> 05:26:48.647]  I like him too.
[05:26:49.387 --> 05:26:49.967]  I love dogs.
[05:26:49.987 --> 05:26:52.930]  If my dog died two years ago, I'd have the guts to buy another one.
[05:26:52.970 --> 05:26:54.491]  I just tell you, I love that dog so much.
[05:26:55.561 --> 05:26:56.902]  Anyways, we're going to break.
[05:26:56.962 --> 05:26:57.662]  We'll be right back.
[05:26:57.722 --> 05:26:58.422]  The show's over.
[05:26:58.442 --> 05:27:01.703]  90% chance we're back tomorrow.
[05:27:01.723 --> 05:27:03.664]  50-50 we're gone by Tuesday.
[05:27:04.144 --> 05:27:04.684]  Love y'all.
[05:27:05.425 --> 05:27:06.425]  And Vaya con Dios.
[05:27:06.805 --> 05:27:07.225]  Vaya con Dios.
[05:27:07.245 --> 05:27:08.786]  God with you.
[05:28:05.364 --> 05:28:08.546]  ...that is destroying every human being created in the image of God.
[05:28:09.167 --> 05:28:14.110]  Because they know what we're going to become.
[05:28:14.230 --> 05:28:18.833]  They are destroyers of worlds, and Earth has been selected for destruction.
