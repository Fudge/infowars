[00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:01.470]  Synthetic.
[00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.051]  Syncytin.
[00:00:03.091 --> 00:00:04.491]  Sorry, it's spelled wrong.
[00:00:04.892 --> 00:00:07.293]  Synthesize cells together.
[00:00:07.493 --> 00:00:08.253]  Cyto.
[00:00:08.734 --> 00:00:09.914]  Syncytin.
[00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:12.256]  Synthetic syncytin.
[00:00:12.736 --> 00:00:16.038]  Our body makes syncytin.
[00:00:16.418 --> 00:00:22.041]  It's a protein that... Wait a minute, so they're programming people with a synthetic thing that we already need.
[00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:23.802]  Oh, but so then it does it's so...
[00:00:24.142 --> 00:00:31.784]  And then we attack, we attack, not that we already need, it's critical for all of life, for fertilization.
[00:00:32.064 --> 00:00:39.985]  So they put a synthetic one in, our body looks at it and says, that's not me, and it can't break it down.
[00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:46.947]  We could break down the monkey, the mouse, the cow, the aborted fetal, and it took too much time to kill us.
[00:00:47.267 --> 00:00:47.767]  The latent
[00:00:47.907 --> 00:00:48.508]  Period.
[00:00:48.768 --> 00:00:53.273]  That's what Burke showed on the clip that you could play the clip tomorrow.
[00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.135]  See, they know what they're doing.
[00:00:55.456 --> 00:00:57.358]  And they're legally liable.
[00:00:57.838 --> 00:01:01.943]  It's it's it's not it's it's at it's the only
[00:01:02.824 --> 00:01:11.987]  Family of retroviruses that infects all cells of the human body and all animals.
[00:01:12.127 --> 00:01:16.288]  Cows, mammals, lizards have syncytin.
[00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:20.129]  All people who carry their young mammals.
[00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.673]  So every cell of the body, including the sperm and the egg.
[00:01:25.094 --> 00:01:33.202]  So they had to put that synthetic one in, in order to kill certain populations.
[00:01:34.423 --> 00:01:44.172]  Pastor Rob, when I was frustrated trying to explain it to him, he said, Judy, have you ever seen the bottom of Darwin's thesis?
[00:01:44.873 --> 00:01:50.174]  And I'm like, I don't know, by natural immune selection, I'm thinking, and I'm trying to explain this.
[00:01:50.774 --> 00:01:51.854]  He's doing what you're doing.
[00:01:51.914 --> 00:01:52.734]  He's interrupted me.
[00:01:52.754 --> 00:01:53.675]  You're looking at his phone.
[00:01:54.055 --> 00:02:02.876]  And he said, no, it says or preservation of favored races in the struggle for life.
[00:02:03.236 --> 00:02:06.497]  And I'm like, oh, my God, there is no struggle for life.
[00:02:06.817 --> 00:02:12.218]  This is this is the cult of scientism playing evolution games.
[00:02:12.538 --> 00:02:15.141]  We didn't become monkeys and stand up.
[00:02:15.482 --> 00:02:19.667]  They had to put synthetic in because they couldn't kill us.
[00:02:19.927 --> 00:02:21.990]  They couldn't get to the seed.
[00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.277]  They couldn't get to the fertilized embryo instead of that shot.
[00:02:27.837 --> 00:02:37.862]  And the reason I'm still go back to that last slide, because this matters for when we elect everything you're saying in the most important election.
[00:02:38.502 --> 00:02:43.005]  Okay, my pen is pointing to COVID in the bottom right.
[00:02:43.405 --> 00:02:44.345]  And that picture is 2006. 2006.
[00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:58.124]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:07.289]  InfoWars.
[00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:10.991]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:03:11.011 --> 00:03:11.372]  Today.
[00:03:27.156 --> 00:03:29.218]  Tad O'Malley has been making claims.
[00:03:29.938 --> 00:03:30.659]  Claims about what?
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.603]  You and everyone you know has a piece of DNA in your genome put there without your knowing it.
[00:03:36.723 --> 00:03:37.464]  Put there by whom?
[00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:39.225]  Well, that's the question of the day.
[00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:41.307]  This is an internet lunatic.
[00:03:41.327 --> 00:03:42.668]  You're not saying you believe him.
[00:03:42.688 --> 00:03:44.129]  Hold on, Agent Einstein.
[00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:45.230]  You're talking to a scientist.
[00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.971]  Forgive me, Assistant Director.
[00:03:47.031 --> 00:03:50.514]  It may sound insensitive, but the suggestion is pure science fiction.
[00:03:50.634 --> 00:03:55.918]  What I'm saying, Agent Einstein, is that the facts as I understand them cannot be discounted out of hand.
[00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:00.794]  No one has the right or the ability to tamper with your DNA.
[00:04:02.616 --> 00:04:03.878]  Unless we gave them that ability.
[00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:13.508]  You say they're tampering with our DNA, that they're able to shut down our immune systems by the addition of something to our DNA.
[00:04:13.728 --> 00:04:15.310]  Yes, but I don't know how exactly.
[00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:16.691]  Or how it's being triggered.
[00:04:17.252 --> 00:04:18.113]  I don't know that either.
[00:04:19.114 --> 00:04:20.135]  Or why it's happening now.
[00:04:21.972 --> 00:04:23.333]  What can we possibly do?
[00:04:23.353 --> 00:04:24.574]  We need to act quickly.
[00:04:25.035 --> 00:04:26.156]  You were right about that.
[00:04:26.236 --> 00:04:27.717]  Well, I was wrong about the science.
[00:04:28.418 --> 00:04:29.799]  I was wrong about what's causing it.
[00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:30.700]  Dead wrong, in fact.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.784]  But it's clearly a widespread failure of our immune systems.
[00:04:34.804 --> 00:04:36.025]  It's through gene tampering.
[00:04:36.245 --> 00:04:39.668]  A virus within a virus that was put there through the smallpox vaccine.
[00:04:39.728 --> 00:04:41.790]  It's what these men are calling the Spartan virus.
[00:04:43.111 --> 00:04:44.092]  We have to figure this out.
[00:04:45.193 --> 00:04:46.394]  What's wrong with the science?
[00:04:47.695 --> 00:04:47.936]  Okay.
[00:04:49.343 --> 00:04:53.084]  The Spartan virus removes the adenosine deaminase gene from your DNA.
[00:04:53.144 --> 00:04:57.106]  It removes the ADA gene and your immune system will simply vanish.
[00:04:57.486 --> 00:04:58.866]  Yeah, but I'm not getting sick.
[00:04:59.686 --> 00:05:00.827]  It's only a matter of time.
[00:05:01.827 --> 00:05:02.127]  Okay.
[00:05:02.848 --> 00:05:03.608]  So how does it work?
[00:05:04.648 --> 00:05:06.769]  How does the virus remove the ADA gene?
[00:05:07.049 --> 00:05:08.409]  A process called CRISPR-Cas9.
[00:05:08.489 --> 00:05:09.470]  CRISPR-Cas9.
[00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.691]  RNA and a protein cutting genes at exact locations.
[00:05:13.791 --> 00:05:14.271]  Exactly.
[00:05:14.592 --> 00:05:16.252]  But in this instance used as a weapon.
[00:05:17.913 --> 00:05:18.693]  The ultimate weapon.
[00:05:20.006 --> 00:05:22.008]  The ability to depopulate the planet.
[00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:24.570]  To kill everyone but the chosen.
[00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.371]  By tampering with their DNA.
[00:05:26.992 --> 00:05:27.833]  Through gene editing.
[00:05:28.033 --> 00:05:29.754]  Why do such a thing and lie about it?
[00:05:29.774 --> 00:05:30.815]  Our own government.
[00:05:30.915 --> 00:05:33.818]  Your own government lies as a matter of course, as a matter of policy.
[00:05:33.838 --> 00:05:37.381]  The Tuskegee experiments on black men in the 30s, Henrietta Lacks.
[00:05:38.662 --> 00:05:39.643]  What are they trying to do?
[00:05:40.236 --> 00:05:41.117]  That's the missing piece.
[00:05:41.517 --> 00:05:42.757]  But it's not hard to imagine.
[00:05:43.378 --> 00:05:47.240]  A government hiding, hoarding technology for 70 years.
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.182]  At the expense of human life and the future of the planet.
[00:05:51.222 --> 00:05:53.784]  Driven not only by corporate greed, but...
[00:05:54.642 --> 00:05:55.562]  A darker objective.
[00:05:56.103 --> 00:05:57.443]  The takeover of America.
[00:05:58.103 --> 00:06:04.286]  And then the world itself, by any means necessary, however violent, or cruel, or efficient.
[00:06:05.246 --> 00:06:14.410]  By severe drought, brought on by weather wars, conducted secretly using aerial contaminants and high-altitude electromagnetic waves, in a state of perpetual war.
[00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:21.174]  To create problem reaction solution scenarios to distract, enrage, and enslave American citizens at home.
[00:06:22.054 --> 00:06:28.858]  With tools like the Patriot Act and the National Defense Authorization Act, which abridge the Constitution in the name of national security.
[00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:33.101]  The militarization of police forces in cities across the U.S.
[00:06:33.421 --> 00:06:37.984]  The building of prison camps by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with no stated purpose.
[00:06:38.624 --> 00:06:49.309]  The corporate takeover of food and agriculture, pharmaceuticals and healthcare, even the military and clandestine agendas to fatten, dull, sicken and control a populace already consumed by consumerism.
[00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:51.290]  And I encourage you all to go shopping more.
[00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:56.712]  A government that taps your phone, collects your data and monitors your whereabouts with impunity.
[00:06:57.433 --> 00:07:00.574]  A government preparing to use that data against you when it strikes.
[00:07:01.574 --> 00:07:02.915]  And the final takeover begins.
[00:07:04.116 --> 00:07:05.096]  The takeover of America.
[00:07:05.697 --> 00:07:11.029]  By a well-oiled and well-armed multinational group of elites that will cull, kill, and subjugate.
[00:07:11.911 --> 00:07:13.194]  Happening as we sit here.
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.041]  It's happening all around us.
[00:07:15.622 --> 00:07:16.943]  The other shoe waiting to drop.
[00:07:17.323 --> 00:07:18.585]  It'll probably start on a Friday.
[00:07:19.185 --> 00:07:24.090]  The banks will announce a security action necessitating their computers to go offline all weekend.
[00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:25.751]  Digital money will disappear.
[00:07:25.771 --> 00:07:27.313]  They can just steal your money?
[00:07:27.593 --> 00:07:32.197]  Followed by the detonation of strategic electromagnetic pulse bombs to knock out major grids.
[00:07:32.378 --> 00:07:35.541]  What will seem like an attack on America by terrorists or Russia.
[00:07:35.561 --> 00:07:36.882]  An invasion of the U.S.
[00:07:37.442 --> 00:07:38.303]  The Russians tried it in 47.
[00:07:41.893 --> 00:07:45.255]  I'm good.
[00:07:56.383 --> 00:08:01.006]  Dr. Judy Michovitz is our guest on this commercial-free transmission today.
[00:08:01.806 --> 00:08:05.629]  It is Saturday, May 11, 2024.
[00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:08.671]  177 days, 12 hours, 54 minutes, 55 seconds.
[00:08:09.131 --> 00:08:11.152]  The most important election in world history.
[00:08:12.053 --> 00:08:12.413]  All right.
[00:08:13.293 --> 00:08:14.394]  She's only got an hour with us.
[00:08:14.534 --> 00:08:15.535]  We really appreciate her.
[00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:16.755]  We can talk to her for 10 hours.
[00:08:17.416 --> 00:08:20.558]  She is a renowned top scientist.
[00:08:21.533 --> 00:08:32.761]  Worked under Fauci, worked under the federal government, ran major projects, and she's been coming on the show since they basically released the COVID and then rolled out the poison shots.
[00:08:33.742 --> 00:08:38.065]  And she said on this show three and a half, four years ago, you can go back and find those.
[00:08:38.125 --> 00:08:39.106]  They're banned on video.
[00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:41.328]  We should repost those to X now that we're back on there.
[00:08:42.189 --> 00:08:45.331]  And everything she said is now all confirmed.
[00:08:45.951 --> 00:08:46.532]  And we have
[00:08:48.112 --> 00:09:01.776]  ABC News, CNN, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Bill Maher, all backpedaling now, saying we shouldn't have locked down the schools, we shouldn't have tried to make you take the shot, or we never tried to make you take the shot.
[00:09:03.217 --> 00:09:08.338]  And it's the same PR campaign from Australia to Germany to the United States, to Canada to the UK.
[00:09:08.818 --> 00:09:11.139]  So, this is really coming out.
[00:09:11.179 --> 00:09:13.560]  The insurance company actuaries have been out for over two years.
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.981]  They continue to show upwards of 22 million dead.
[00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:22.512]  They admit record heart attacks, myocarditis, blood clots, infertility, turbo cancer.
[00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:43.063]  Dr. Minkovits explained years ago that they were putting in the so-called shot that was secret, now they admit they changed it thousands of times, that's mainstream news, in a giant test on the public, flooding it with upwards of 200 billion pieces of DNA per injection.
[00:09:43.724 --> 00:09:45.825]  That is CBS News last week.
[00:09:46.744 --> 00:09:50.525]  So it does have DNA in it, not just the mRNA.
[00:09:51.065 --> 00:09:58.668]  And she explained that they were polluting everybody to cover up what was coming out that they'd already polluted us with, with the other so-called injections.
[00:09:59.708 --> 00:10:01.549]  So she is a expert.
[00:10:02.369 --> 00:10:12.993]  I'm not going to go over her entire background and all of her different degrees in biochemistry, molecular biology, chemistry, the list goes on and on.
[00:10:14.198 --> 00:10:22.580]  She pioneered in the fields of immunology, chemistry, epigenetics, HIV, AIDS, drug development.
[00:10:23.923 --> 00:10:26.384]  And they were able to isolate exactly what was going on.
[00:10:26.424 --> 00:10:28.164]  Then, of course, the Feds came after her.
[00:10:28.884 --> 00:10:40.528]  And she has co-authored more than 50 peer-reviewed publications and books, holds patents on combination therapy for prostate cancer using botanical compositions, and it goes on from there.
[00:10:41.128 --> 00:10:44.609]  And, of course, she's also in New York Times a number one best-selling author.
[00:10:46.169 --> 00:10:46.709]  We're good to go.
[00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:25.603]  TheRealDrJudy.com is her excellent website, but you cannot have someone out of all the amazing whistleblowers and all the amazing, she was a whistleblower 15, 20 years ago, none of them, and it's not a competition, none of them have been as on target as her from day one.
[00:11:26.244 --> 00:11:27.705]  And so now that we have so much hindsight,
