[00:00:01.121 --> 00:00:06.906]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:08.187 --> 00:00:21.017]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and support the InfoWars.
[00:00:21.137 --> 00:00:22.698]  It's Thursday, July 11, 2024.
[00:00:22.918 --> 00:00:25.661]  We got the biggest World War III news yet breaking in just minutes.
[00:00:30.103 --> 00:00:34.264]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:35.025 --> 00:00:36.745]  The president will hold a press conference.
[00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:39.526]  I guess a big boy press conference is what we're calling it.
[00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.006]  A big boy press conference.
[00:00:41.447 --> 00:00:41.907]  Watch this!
[00:00:42.087 --> 00:00:42.547]  Big boy!
[00:00:42.967 --> 00:00:47.889]  Oh I am a big boy, a big boy, a big boy.
[00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.850]  Oh I am a big boy and this is what I do.
[00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:56.511]  Joe, you did such a great job.
[00:00:56.531 --> 00:00:58.252]  You answered every question.
[00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:00.091]  Do you know all the facts?
[00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:05.091]  Oh, I am a big boy, a big boy, a big boy.
[00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:10.091]  Oh, I am a big boy and this is what I do.
[00:01:10.091 --> 00:01:15.091]   They're describing it at the White House as a big boy press conference.
[00:01:15.783 --> 00:01:21.346]  Oh, I am a big boy, a big boy, a big boy.
[00:01:21.806 --> 00:01:26.970]  Oh, I am a big boy and this is what I do.
[00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.932]  Two, ten, twelve, fifteen, folks stepping on them.
[00:01:30.292 --> 00:01:32.292]  There's a... there's black.
[00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:37.292]  Oh I am a big boy, a big boy, a big boy.
[00:01:37.292 --> 00:01:41.792]  Oh I am a big boy, and this is what I do.
[00:01:41.792 --> 00:01:45.792]   Well, one way to stop getting people to focus on him being 81
[00:01:45.792 --> 00:01:48.792]   and possibly having issues with his acuity is just to call him a big boy.
[00:01:48.792 --> 00:01:50.292]  Hmm...
[00:01:50.292 --> 00:01:51.292]  Hmm...
[00:01:51.292 --> 00:01:53.292]  Uh-oh.
[00:01:53.292 --> 00:01:55.292]  Yeah.
[00:01:55.292 --> 00:01:56.292]  [laughter]
[00:01:56.292 --> 00:01:57.292]  [squeak]
[00:01:57.292 --> 00:01:59.871]  (upbeat music)
[00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:02.451]  (upbeat music)
[00:02:02.108 --> 00:02:07.377]  It's Thursday, July 11th, 2024, and all hell's breaking loose.
[00:02:07.617 --> 00:02:10.657]   You're listening to the number one independent media transmission
[00:02:10.657 --> 00:02:14.657]  promoting freedom worldwide, the Alex Jones Show.
[00:02:14.657 --> 00:02:26.656]  [Music]
[00:02:26.656 --> 00:02:48.656]  [Music]
[00:02:48.656 --> 00:02:54.656]   While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:02:54.656 --> 00:02:57.656]  (music)
[00:02:57.656 --> 00:03:07.656]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:01.840]  Well, I thought we'd air some funny stuff at the start of the show.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.520]  We don't want to be total Debbie Downers here.
[00:03:07.321 --> 00:03:14.102]  But boy, did they go up the Threat Escalation, RAN Corporation, War Game ladder to Armageddon a couple more steps.
[00:03:16.183 --> 00:03:22.024]  Well, NATO has officially announced that they are moving long-range missiles up to the border with Russia.
[00:03:23.744 --> 00:03:25.804]  And that, of course, violates a bunch of treaties that the U.S.
[00:03:25.844 --> 00:03:27.885]  and Russia have not been following now for five years.
[00:03:29.156 --> 00:03:34.999]  And Russia has vowed, quote, military response to U.S.
[00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:38.260]  missile deployment plans.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:51.347]  That's why I put the headline out on X. Had real Alex Jones that this is a emergency transmission because this is insanely dangerous.
[00:03:51.507 --> 00:03:53.708]  We'll be going over all of that today.
[00:03:54.611 --> 00:04:02.014]  European countries like Germany have been forced to water down compulsory military draft plans after massive backlash, but they're getting ready for full war.
[00:04:02.034 --> 00:04:07.475]  NATO is saying they're bracing for Russian invasion, which is totally preposterous.
[00:04:08.896 --> 00:04:11.557]  NATO knows damn well they started this whole thing.
[00:04:13.317 --> 00:04:23.061]  But now they've had speeches at the UN where the WUF censorship czars are saying they need internet censorship because people aren't supporting the Ukraine war.
[00:04:24.195 --> 00:04:37.672]  Thousand-year-old Notre Dame, not the one in Paris but another one in France, has been lit on fire and the police are saying looks like another religious attack as the loving Islamists burn down every church they can.
[00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.471]  This is footage I sent earlier this morning.
[00:04:41.511 --> 00:04:43.872]  Now they've got footage of the fire shooting out the top.
[00:04:43.912 --> 00:04:46.533]  We'll get to that a little bit later.
[00:04:47.394 --> 00:04:55.938]  True marvels of engineering and beautiful human architecture now turn into Islamic Roman candles as they celebrate their ongoing...
[00:04:57.168 --> 00:05:02.270]  Conquest and usurpation of the once fabulous West.
[00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.151]  I'm Alex Jones, dug in in Central Texas.
[00:05:06.651 --> 00:05:09.312]  Fighting to the end, victory or death.
[00:05:09.892 --> 00:05:11.793]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:05:12.213 --> 00:05:12.793]  You found it!
[00:05:13.573 --> 00:05:17.354]  The front lines in the fight for truth and human liberty, justice and security.
[00:05:20.295 --> 00:05:22.276]  Fighting for the once great free world.
[00:05:23.616 --> 00:05:25.957]  Hold a remnant in place so we can rebuild.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:36.285]  It is Thursday, July 11th, 2024, and we're going to have open phones yet again today.
[00:05:36.325 --> 00:05:49.014]  And then Doug Mackey, famously sentenced to federal prison for making a meme about Hillary Clinton, will be joining us to talk about all things censorship in the third hour again.
[00:05:49.854 --> 00:05:55.038]  Ladies and gentlemen, let's put that back on screen, how many days out we are from the election.
[00:05:56.619 --> 00:06:00.895]   You're saying, wait, we're only 116 days out.
[00:06:01.276 --> 00:06:03.177]  Why do you have a bigger number on screen?
[00:06:04.178 --> 00:06:05.759]  Because we're technically 116 days, 12 hours, 52 minutes, 53 seconds.
[00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:12.405]  But, put the larger number up, we are 192 days, 12 hours, 52 minutes, and 44 seconds until Trump being sworn in on the south side of the U.S.
[00:06:12.225 --> 00:06:21.903]   We are 192 days, 12 hours, 52 minutes and 44 seconds until Trump being sworn in on the
[00:06:21.903 --> 00:06:30.625]  South side of the US Capitol in Washington, DC.
[00:06:30.625 --> 00:06:33.903]  Or Mordor on the Potomac as it's popularly known.
[00:06:33.903 --> 00:06:43.903]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:06:35.045 --> 00:06:37.866]  That's the real date.
[00:06:38.886 --> 00:06:44.108]  It's 192 days because they are going, if Trump's able, the American people are able to override all the fraud.
[00:06:44.128 --> 00:06:52.450]  They are going to come in with everything they've got and create massive civil unrest, financial collapse, you name it, in my view.
[00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.310]  That is what they're planning.
[00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.431]  And I predicted the last 79 days of hell.
[00:07:00.387 --> 00:07:05.748]  So once we get to the election, there will be 79 days of craziness.
[00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:09.229]  And then I would not expect it to stop after that.
[00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:17.172]  Now, we have a lot of incredibly powerful news and information today.
[00:07:17.232 --> 00:07:25.834]  They are definitely going to try, and are already in the middle of, a bird flu and new COVID scare that I've been telling you was coming, according to my federal sources, since last year.
[00:07:27.302 --> 00:07:28.483]  And it's now happening.
[00:07:29.344 --> 00:07:31.065]  Massive news on that front.
[00:07:31.165 --> 00:07:32.146]  Three large stacks.
[00:07:33.687 --> 00:07:35.949]  We have Russia vowing military response to U.S.
[00:07:36.349 --> 00:07:42.594]  missile deployment into Western Europe with long-range and medium-range missiles.
[00:07:44.156 --> 00:07:51.722]  We have the ongoing Soros plan, not just here but in Europe, to destabilize and create massive crime waves.
[00:07:54.008 --> 00:08:02.756]  We have a lot of economic news and attacks on free speech news and Ben Shapiro's testimony to Congress about censorship yesterday.
[00:08:02.796 --> 00:08:06.119]  And everybody's attacking Ben Shapiro right now, conservatives are.
[00:08:08.161 --> 00:08:10.983]  And look, we need all the help we can get getting Trump elected.
[00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:12.785]  He's come around to supporting Trump.
[00:08:14.186 --> 00:08:16.648]  He's now suddenly discovered censorship and is against it.
[00:08:17.869 --> 00:08:20.612]  He did a good job testifying about the censorship that's going on.
[00:08:21.912 --> 00:08:25.173]  But he never really told them that he was involved in it.
[00:08:26.774 --> 00:08:27.394]  But that's fine.
[00:08:27.454 --> 00:08:30.816]  If he's suddenly against it, I just see that as a sign of victory and success.
[00:08:30.976 --> 00:08:33.897]  And he did, as usual, wipe the floor.
[00:08:33.957 --> 00:08:34.778]  It's not hard to do.
[00:08:34.858 --> 00:08:35.478]  But he is smart.
[00:08:35.498 --> 00:08:36.018]  He's well-spoken.
[00:08:36.038 --> 00:08:36.919]  Let's not take that away from him.
[00:08:37.399 --> 00:08:42.401]  From Eric Swallowswell and other communist Chinese spies.
[00:08:43.462 --> 00:08:46.443]  He got questioned by multiple known communist Chinese spies.
[00:08:48.123 --> 00:08:53.147]  So we'll talk about that in the third hour with our guest dealing with this.
[00:08:54.148 --> 00:09:04.797]  And all I'm saying is, it seems to be like a free-for-all attacking Ben Shapiro and attacking Jordan Peterson right now.
[00:09:05.017 --> 00:09:11.623]  And it's not my job to defend those guys, but I think Jordan Peterson does a lot more good than he does harm.
[00:09:12.484 --> 00:09:15.766]  He's come around to our way of view on the New World Order.
[00:09:16.724 --> 00:09:18.086]  So I see it like Elon Musk.
[00:09:18.186 --> 00:09:25.094]  If they're coming around to our side, I really think that it's entertaining and interesting to attack them.
[00:09:25.915 --> 00:09:27.356]  But people ask why I don't do it.
[00:09:27.396 --> 00:09:29.999]  I've had a lot of people yesterday and today say, why aren't you attacking Ben Shapiro?
[00:09:33.001 --> 00:09:34.762]  Jordan Peterson and all the controversies with them.
[00:09:35.402 --> 00:09:37.483]  And look, I love Harrison Smith.
[00:09:37.563 --> 00:09:38.143]  I love Owen.
[00:09:38.223 --> 00:09:39.144]  I don't tell them what to say.
[00:09:39.264 --> 00:09:40.625]  I hired them because I like them.
[00:09:40.645 --> 00:09:41.325]  I think they're smart.
[00:09:41.765 --> 00:09:43.886]  I think they genuinely believe what they're saying.
[00:09:43.906 --> 00:09:45.127]  They're right about almost everything.
[00:09:45.487 --> 00:09:46.927]  And it's a difference of perspective.
[00:09:46.967 --> 00:09:56.772]  People say, well, why isn't, you know, people like Owen Schroeder and Harrison saying some things different than Alex Jones and Alex Jones is saying some different things to them.
[00:09:56.792 --> 00:10:00.514]  Because it's not a cult that they don't get in a room every day and I tell them what to say.
[00:10:01.758 --> 00:10:02.859]  I'm not saying you should stop doing it.
[00:10:02.698 --> 00:10:08.139]   In fact, I reposted Owen, let's get that clip, I forgot to send it to you,
[00:10:08.139 --> 00:10:09.877]  really going after Ben Shapiro yesterday.
[00:10:09.877 --> 00:10:12.238]  And I think that's an important perspective.
[00:10:12.238 --> 00:10:14.557]  I'm not saying you should stop doing it.
[00:10:14.557 --> 00:10:22.158]   I'm simply saying, you don't see me spending a lot of time on that because I'm just dealing
[00:10:22.158 --> 00:10:28.397]   with the totally open borders and World War III and the fentanyl deaths and the world government
[00:10:28.397 --> 00:10:30.198]  and the Satanism and the pedophilia.
[00:10:30.084 --> 00:10:31.864]  And by the way, my host all covered that too.
[00:10:33.545 --> 00:10:38.045]  I'm just explaining my perspective of where I come from on this.
[00:10:39.446 --> 00:10:45.647]  And I saw a lot of criticism, not just by my crew, but by other people of Shapiro's testimony.
[00:10:46.267 --> 00:10:49.067]  So, I got up about 4 a.m.
[00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:57.311]   this morning, and I decided to watch Over an hour and a half of the testimony, and I thought he did a good job exposing how they're censoring us.
[00:10:57.331 --> 00:11:08.219]  So, yeah, he's been on the enemy team, and he's supported censorship and the poison shots, but he's coming around, so I see that as a sign of victory.
[00:11:09.239 --> 00:11:16.845]  That he is a gatekeeper, has been unable to gatekeep conservatives, and his audience is now demanding he be a big boy.
[00:11:18.166 --> 00:11:21.068]  And so we're always excited for people to become big boys here.
[00:11:22.376 --> 00:11:26.961]  And we like to see everybody sound like Alex Jones from 20 years ago today.
[00:11:28.242 --> 00:11:31.745]  And then they'll catch up to the Alex Jones of today that knows even more next week.
[00:11:32.226 --> 00:11:37.811]  Because the growth curve of Awakening is so incredibly fast.
[00:11:37.971 --> 00:11:44.558]  Now, that said, we are the most attacked, most demonized broadcast in the world.
[00:11:47.479 --> 00:11:49.761]  Not by fellow populists or Christians or conservatives.
[00:11:49.821 --> 00:11:51.922]  We've got almost universal support there and that's great.
[00:11:51.942 --> 00:11:56.125]  People get like we're really trying to stop the new world order here.
[00:11:56.526 --> 00:11:57.506]  We really do our research.
[00:11:57.546 --> 00:11:58.787]  We have a lot of amazing guests on.
[00:11:59.888 --> 00:12:03.611]  A lot of great reporters and researchers and pundits here at Infowars.
[00:12:04.611 --> 00:12:09.555]  But I do need to remind listeners that after Trump, we're numero uno target.
[00:12:10.569 --> 00:12:11.610]  So we need your prayer.
[00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:15.833]  We need your word of mouth to spread the articles, videos, and reports without you or nothing.
[00:12:16.774 --> 00:12:21.298]  And we need your financial support and our great sponsor with amazing products you need.
[00:12:22.899 --> 00:12:28.444]  All the great nano silver and colloidal silver products and so much more at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:12:30.085 --> 00:12:39.452]  So if you want to stand with the tip of the spear and be part of the tip of the spear, spread the article, spread the videos, give us intel, give us commentary, send us news tips.
[00:12:40.489 --> 00:12:54.978]  Pray for the show, buy the products at DRJONESNATURALS.COM or 888-253-3139 is the toll free number to call InfoWars and get great products as well.
[00:12:55.018 --> 00:13:07.445]  There's a big sale going on there, upwards of 60% off at InfoWarsStore.com and at DRJONESNATURALS.COM, 57% off on the highest quality, 30 parts per million nano silver.
[00:13:08.869 --> 00:13:15.854]  As a loss leader in the store, the same stuff, private labeled by Whole Foods, sells for $30 retail, 24 discounted.
[00:13:15.874 --> 00:13:23.500]  We usually sell it for discounted down to $19.95, but usually it's about $22.23 when we, at regular price, we're selling it.
[00:13:24.381 --> 00:13:27.483]  Oh, I guess they just removed the sale from 57% off.
[00:13:27.603 --> 00:13:28.284]  Oops, sorry.
[00:13:29.805 --> 00:13:31.826]  I didn't know my dad changed that since yesterday.
[00:13:31.846 --> 00:13:33.668]  Well, the point is there's a lot of great products.
[00:13:35.473 --> 00:13:37.975]  Here's what I want to do.
[00:13:38.015 --> 00:13:40.136]  I just mentioned to you a lot of what's coming up today.
[00:13:39.955 --> 00:13:44.195]   the fact that it went to 33% off. I know they were selling out of it quick. So there you
[00:13:44.195 --> 00:13:53.835]   go. All right. Here's what I want to do. I just mentioned to you a lot of what's coming
[00:13:53.835 --> 00:14:02.395]   up today. And we've got a lot of big election news that I want to hit first. And I've done
[00:14:03.136 --> 00:14:04.196]  I've interviewed the experts.
[00:14:04.856 --> 00:14:05.657]  Anybody can check this.
[00:14:05.677 --> 00:14:07.558]  I mean, it's not like I'm telling you some big secret.
[00:14:11.079 --> 00:14:17.422]  It looks like they've waited too long and really can't even replace Biden if they follow the law.
[00:14:18.903 --> 00:14:21.044]  But they're basically saying they're not going to follow the law.
[00:14:21.064 --> 00:14:22.464]  They're still going to try to force him to leave.
[00:14:22.504 --> 00:14:23.565]  That's going to be spectacular.
[00:14:25.777 --> 00:14:28.399]  And then it truly will not be a real election.
[00:14:29.039 --> 00:14:40.507]  So if you're not having a real election, the law is publicly being violated, and you've got a selected candidate, and all the federal laws are violated, isn't that in a way canceling the election?
[00:14:41.067 --> 00:14:43.709]  I mean, it's still going to go forward, but it won't be a real election.
[00:14:43.809 --> 00:14:51.615]  Trump had to jump through all the proper constitutional hoops, all the criminal and civil cases, all the lawfare, all the debanking, all the attacks.
[00:14:52.645 --> 00:15:05.974]  And then the other side hands the nomination to Biden, doesn't have any debates, rigs the primaries, then now they're trying to remove him, even though his name will still be on the ballot, they're saying they don't care, and then they're just going to try to force that through.
[00:15:06.014 --> 00:15:09.137]  I mean, that is beyond bonkers.
[00:15:10.157 --> 00:15:12.119]  And there's a good breakdown on it at Gateway Pundit.
[00:15:12.159 --> 00:15:19.564]  Remember, it may already be too late for Democrats to replace Joe Biden as 24 candidate without surrendering several battleground states.
[00:15:22.472 --> 00:15:23.312]  Document included.
[00:15:24.833 --> 00:15:34.819]  So I want to go over some of the numbers on that, but here though is the really big, gigantic takeaway.
[00:15:35.179 --> 00:15:47.066]  And we've got eight clips, okay, of Democrats reading off the same script in Congress yesterday and today.
[00:15:48.163 --> 00:15:53.685]  And they're in opposition to the SAVE Act that would just make you show an ID that you're a citizen to vote.
[00:15:55.626 --> 00:16:01.329]  And not just stuff, you know, hundreds of ballots at midnight into a box and then they're all filled out for Joe Biden.
[00:16:02.649 --> 00:16:14.214]  So a huge stack of news on that front that we're going to be breaking down here in just a moment.
[00:16:16.974 --> 00:16:31.277]  But before I do that, I also wanted to remind listeners that we'll be doing a deep dive on the concerted attack on free speech worldwide and all the different angles to that in the third hour today.
[00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:48.525]   But I feel like before I cover this election news, and there's a lot of it, that it's very important to understand that The Democrat Party deep state is in total turmoil and is in a civil war with themselves.
[00:16:49.726 --> 00:16:52.127]  And a lot of people are celebrating that.
[00:16:54.248 --> 00:17:05.414]  But at the same time, we should be politically engaged and praying and getting ready because it is ultra, ultra dangerous to have that type of situation unfolding.
[00:17:06.674 --> 00:17:19.039]   So we'll do the deep dive on the election and play you the most incredible clips yet When the Democrats openly say, if you don't let illegal aliens vote, you're racist.
[00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:27.281]  So they've gone from no illegals are voting, which of course they are in mass, to now, yes, you've got to let them vote or you're racist.
[00:17:27.361 --> 00:17:34.023]  So, flip of a switch, a 180 back turn, they are now saying this.
[00:17:34.043 --> 00:17:36.444]  But first, I want to show why they're in such panic mode.
[00:17:38.988 --> 00:17:41.410]  Daily Show, CNN had the same thing happen last week.
[00:17:42.151 --> 00:17:46.995]  Shocked as half of black voters in a focus group are backing Trump.
[00:17:49.097 --> 00:17:50.318]  And that's what the numbers are showing.
[00:17:50.418 --> 00:17:50.798]  Almost 50%.
[00:17:51.939 --> 00:17:58.165]  And a lot of pollsters believe a lot of blacks are embarrassed they're going to vote for Trump and are afraid of community pressure.
[00:17:58.185 --> 00:18:03.269]  But as it becomes clear that the majority support Trump, he could get 60% or more.
[00:18:03.289 --> 00:18:06.492]  And that's what's coming out of New York polls right now.
[00:18:08.146 --> 00:18:19.772]  Is that New York State and New York City are now in play and New York is a battleground state.
[00:18:20.753 --> 00:18:24.114]  That's how big this political realignment is.
[00:18:24.274 --> 00:18:25.355]  Here's the Daily Show report.
[00:18:26.465 --> 00:18:27.026]  What up, world?
[00:18:27.346 --> 00:18:31.911]  It's Josh Johnson, full-time Daily Show correspondent and full-time black guy.
[00:18:32.351 --> 00:18:34.473]  But more than that, I'm also a part-time voter.
[00:18:34.914 --> 00:18:39.498]  Now, black voters have been the backbone of elected Democratic presidents since Bill Clinton went on Arsenio.
[00:18:39.899 --> 00:18:46.586]  In fact, 91% of black voters voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, and 92% voted for Joe Biden last election.
[00:18:47.547 --> 00:18:48.608]  So why does this year feel...
[00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:50.771]  Different.
[00:18:50.791 --> 00:18:55.134]  New polling shows 23% support among black voters for former President Trump.
[00:18:55.235 --> 00:18:59.098]  That's up 19 points since the 2020 election.
[00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:01.700]  Contrary to popular belief, not all black people know each other.
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:09.847]  So in order to find out how all black people felt about Trump, I got six from the tri-state area to ask, do we f*** with Trump?
[00:19:10.587 --> 00:19:14.049]  Okay, so who will you be voting for in 2024?
[00:19:14.589 --> 00:19:14.849]  Darryl?
[00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:16.710]  Do I have to say his name?
[00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:19.612]  I don't want to, but more than likely it's gonna be Trump.
[00:19:19.692 --> 00:19:21.052]  Yeah, I believe him.
[00:19:21.272 --> 00:19:22.433]  I believe him.
[00:19:22.453 --> 00:19:23.313]  Who are you gonna be voting for?
[00:19:23.353 --> 00:19:23.794]  Biden.
[00:19:24.074 --> 00:19:24.894]  And then, Victor?
[00:19:25.114 --> 00:19:25.494]  I'm with her.
[00:19:25.735 --> 00:19:26.675]  Oh, Biden, okay.
[00:19:26.775 --> 00:19:27.816]  Trump.
[00:19:27.896 --> 00:19:28.156]  Trump?
[00:19:28.216 --> 00:19:28.616]  Biden.
[00:19:28.916 --> 00:19:29.316]  Biden?
[00:19:29.596 --> 00:19:29.957]  Trump.
[00:19:30.217 --> 00:19:36.360]  Okay, we're an even split, which... Yeah, I didn't see that coming.
[00:19:38.499 --> 00:19:41.181]  So, do you think there's gonna be a big shift, any sort of change?
[00:19:41.221 --> 00:19:42.262]  I think it's gonna be a big shift.
[00:19:42.322 --> 00:19:42.802]  Me too.
[00:19:42.922 --> 00:19:43.503]  Big shift?
[00:19:43.543 --> 00:19:43.843]  Yes.
[00:19:44.283 --> 00:19:44.743]  Really?
[00:19:44.823 --> 00:19:45.184]  Okay.
[00:19:45.264 --> 00:19:47.325]  For me, I've always been a Democrat.
[00:19:47.625 --> 00:19:55.431]  And it's like, for the most part with the Democratic Party, they always make a bunch of promises that they can't deliver.
[00:19:55.711 --> 00:20:01.094]  You know, they use the issues of the African American community as a soapbox to stand on.
[00:20:01.615 --> 00:20:04.417]  And make promises, you know, just to get us to come out and vote.
[00:20:04.577 --> 00:20:08.660]   And then once we vote, and everyone's in place, It's like, well, what happened?
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:15.046]  Would you say it's anything like somebody's in your DM and they're really laying it down to take you over here.
[00:20:15.066 --> 00:20:16.948]  Girl, I'll take you to the top.
[00:20:17.529 --> 00:20:20.432]  I mean, and then you finally go on the date and it's Burger King.
[00:20:20.251 --> 00:20:30.251]   If the polls are right and Trump is going up with black voters, what changed?
[00:20:30.251 --> 00:20:32.571]  I wish I knew.
[00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:34.187]  I am not a huge fan of Trump.
[00:20:34.668 --> 00:20:36.029]  He don't respect the black person.
[00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:37.051]  And Biden does?
[00:20:37.572 --> 00:20:41.117]  Has Biden issued an apology for the things that he's been caught saying?
[00:20:41.437 --> 00:20:43.440]  He said if you don't vote for me, you're not black.
[00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:44.041]  You're not black!
[00:20:44.898 --> 00:20:45.939]  What is that?
[00:20:45.999 --> 00:20:50.003]  They have both said things that were questionable and unsavory.
[00:20:50.143 --> 00:20:55.429]  But when you start looking at facts, it's like, Biden, you done dropped the ball, brother.
[00:20:55.969 --> 00:20:58.772]  Okay, so some black voters feel let down by Democrats.
[00:20:59.032 --> 00:21:02.596]  But I wasn't sure if they knew about how Trump likened himself to black Americans.
[00:21:02.936 --> 00:21:06.580]  So I showed them some footage of Trump at the Black Conservative Federation Gala.
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:10.823]  I'm being indicted for you, the black population.
[00:21:11.283 --> 00:21:13.145]  I want to play a little game, alright?
[00:21:13.245 --> 00:21:16.948]  Now the game is gonna be either fist or finger, right?
[00:21:17.028 --> 00:21:21.091]  If you like what's happening, you're gonna put up your black fist.
[00:21:21.151 --> 00:21:23.893]  Now, if you don't like what's happening, there's a finger.
[00:21:26.735 --> 00:21:27.175]  Y'all ready?
[00:21:27.195 --> 00:21:27.936]  We're ready.
[00:21:28.036 --> 00:21:28.436]  Okay.
[00:21:28.716 --> 00:21:28.917]  Good.
[00:21:29.957 --> 00:21:34.321]  These lights are so bright in my eyes that I can't see too many people out there.
[00:21:35.444 --> 00:21:38.649]  But, uh, I can only see the black ones.
[00:21:38.709 --> 00:21:40.351]  I can't see any white ones, you see?
[00:21:40.712 --> 00:21:41.994]  That's how far I've come.
[00:21:42.975 --> 00:21:44.975]  That's how far I've come.
[00:21:44.975 --> 00:21:46.975]  [laughter]
[00:21:46.975 --> 00:21:48.975]  [applause]
[00:21:48.975 --> 00:21:50.975]  [laughter]
[00:21:50.975 --> 00:21:52.975]  [overlapping voices]
[00:21:52.975 --> 00:21:54.975]  [overlapping voices]
[00:21:54.975 --> 00:21:56.975]  [overlapping voices]
[00:21:56.975 --> 00:21:58.975]  [overlapping voices]
[00:21:58.975 --> 00:22:00.975]  [overlapping voices]
[00:22:00.975 --> 00:22:02.975]  I'll play the next clip for you real quick.
[00:22:03.197 --> 00:22:13.580]  Black conservatives understand better than most that some of the greatest evils in our nation's history have come from corrupt systems that try to target and subjugate others.
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:14.580]  You understand that?
[00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:21.222]   I think that's why The black people are so much on my side now because they see what's happening to me happens to them.
[00:22:21.242 --> 00:22:23.806]  He had me at the first question.
[00:22:23.826 --> 00:22:24.607]  I mean the first thing.
[00:22:24.647 --> 00:22:24.968]  He messed up.
[00:22:25.028 --> 00:22:26.189]  And then he messed up at the end.
[00:22:26.209 --> 00:22:26.991]  Yeah, how's that funny?
[00:22:27.131 --> 00:22:29.174]  Okay, can we get our signs up?
[00:22:30.948 --> 00:22:35.449]  Okay, let's go on to the next clip real quick.
[00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:41.291]  But I got indicted for nothing, for something that is nothing.
[00:22:41.691 --> 00:22:48.413]  And a lot of people said that that's why the black people like me, because they have been hurt so badly and discriminated against.
[00:22:48.433 --> 00:22:52.194]  And they actually viewed me as I'm being discriminated against.
[00:22:52.494 --> 00:22:54.494]  It's been quite amazing.
[00:22:54.494 --> 00:22:56.494]  [Audience awws]
[00:22:56.494 --> 00:22:58.494]  [Laughter]
[00:22:58.494 --> 00:23:03.494]  Um, alright, so kind of still along the same party lines.
[00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:06.573]  Now, do you think Trump is being discriminated against?
[00:23:07.073 --> 00:23:07.634]  Not at all.
[00:23:07.794 --> 00:23:11.137]  It's not one side, it's the legal system.
[00:23:11.357 --> 00:23:15.360]  No matter who you are, if you do these things, you get charged for it.
[00:23:15.521 --> 00:23:15.961]  That's it.
[00:23:16.181 --> 00:23:18.843]  There are two systems of justice.
[00:23:19.324 --> 00:23:23.247]  We cannot get away with the same thing white folks get away with.
[00:23:23.567 --> 00:23:31.294]  But with this different sort of accountability system, does it feel like Trump is bad at being white?
[00:23:31.314 --> 00:23:35.257]  He was 91!
[00:23:35.557 --> 00:23:47.514]   I noticed how, when I was incarcerated, right, how The white incarcerated people seem to be more angrier than the black incarcerated people.
[00:23:47.834 --> 00:23:49.715]  Trump is like the same thought pattern.
[00:23:49.735 --> 00:23:50.955]  This ain't supposed to happen to me.
[00:23:51.315 --> 00:23:52.716]  I'm not supposed to be indicted.
[00:23:53.096 --> 00:23:57.278]  People are not supposed to tell me I committed a crime because I am privileged.
[00:23:57.619 --> 00:23:57.959]  Damn.
[00:23:58.499 --> 00:24:02.182]  I had no idea the appeal process for incarcerated white people was gaslighting.
[00:24:02.602 --> 00:24:04.804]  But Trump is fighting close to 100 felony charges.
[00:24:05.304 --> 00:24:07.646]  How much of a criminal is too much of a criminal?
[00:24:08.086 --> 00:24:15.852]  If more charges get racked up, maybe things that start to become a bit more egregious, is that going to start to weigh on whether or not you're going to change your vote?
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:26.704]  You start, you pay attention, you listen to the facts, not the fluff, and then you actually have to start doing some research to make sure that what's being presented to you is actual facts.
[00:24:26.724 --> 00:24:27.004]  Bingo!
[00:24:27.284 --> 00:24:28.284]  And it takes some digging.
[00:24:28.304 --> 00:24:35.307]  Okay, so if you dug, and you did your research, and you found out what Josh just said was true, would that sway your vote?
[00:24:35.687 --> 00:24:36.287]  Probably not.
[00:24:37.507 --> 00:24:45.170]  I definitely, you know, did not sit down with this panel to change any minds, and I clearly have not.
[00:24:45.469 --> 00:24:46.390]  Okay, so let's analyze that.
[00:24:46.329 --> 00:24:52.889]   So yeah, I guess some black folks do s*** with Trump, but was there anything I could
[00:24:52.889 --> 00:24:54.409]  get this panel to agree on?
[00:24:54.409 --> 00:25:01.688]  Can we keep these instances so useful in everyday life?
[00:25:01.688 --> 00:25:03.009]  Okay so let's analyze that.
[00:25:03.009 --> 00:25:07.028]  I'm sure everybody caught what really went on there.
[00:25:07.028 --> 00:25:10.490]   So they go get a real focus group, and you can see that's who they picked out of the
[00:25:10.752 --> 00:25:16.173]  They had a whole bunch of other black folks watching the panel that had been part of the selection process.
[00:25:16.193 --> 00:25:17.253]  That's how focus groups work.
[00:25:17.273 --> 00:25:21.354]  You start with a larger group and then work down to who you're going to actually have as the panel on TV.
[00:25:24.035 --> 00:25:27.596]  They didn't show Biden saying blacks are super predators and need to all be put in jail.
[00:25:28.516 --> 00:25:32.597]  They didn't show all the outrageous stuff he said or did.
[00:25:33.712 --> 00:25:41.462]  They only cherry pick stuff that they thought some black people may not like to then turn the group against Trump.
[00:25:42.624 --> 00:25:46.509]  But the people that like Trump, half the black folks, they couldn't be turned.
[00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:49.353]  And the other people just didn't like Trump even more after that.
[00:25:49.953 --> 00:25:50.855]  And what did Trump say?
[00:25:52.711 --> 00:25:54.272]  That's what black folks have said in polls.
[00:25:54.332 --> 00:25:57.393]  We feel like we've been discriminated against by the criminal justice system.
[00:25:57.433 --> 00:26:03.535]  You can't deny in the past that they've written laws for black people, like the crack laws that Joe Biden helped write.
[00:26:04.756 --> 00:26:07.657]  Whereas crack was mainly used by blacks, on average, in the 80s.
[00:26:08.537 --> 00:26:16.521]  And whites, if you got caught with pure cocaine that could make, you know, a hundred rocks, you might get a year in jail.
[00:26:16.581 --> 00:26:19.622]  But if you got caught with one rock, you'd get five years in jail.
[00:26:20.562 --> 00:26:24.999]   So how is a hundred rocks Not as bad as One Rock.
[00:26:25.019 --> 00:26:28.563]  Well, because the white people were snorting it, they weren't smoking it.
[00:26:30.686 --> 00:26:32.809]  And who created the crack recipe?
[00:26:32.829 --> 00:26:33.650]  Who put it on the streets?
[00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:34.331]  The CIA.
[00:26:34.591 --> 00:26:35.472]  That's been declassified.
[00:26:35.492 --> 00:26:36.373]  They've had a congressional hearing.
[00:26:36.433 --> 00:26:40.398]  So, yeah, that stuff's gone on, and it's the same deep state.
[00:26:41.311 --> 00:26:46.453]  Democrats running it, Republicans have been involved, like Herbert Walker Bush is definitely involved in actually shipping it in.
[00:26:46.953 --> 00:26:56.218]  I'm not saying it's just a Democrat thing, but the Democrats are the party of the KKK, they are the party of Jim Crow, they are the party of segregation, they are the party that did all this.
[00:26:56.258 --> 00:27:08.448]   It was Charlton Heston and Richard Nixon When he was a senator and then a vice president that traveled around the country to get the Civil Rights Act passed.
[00:27:08.468 --> 00:27:09.589]  Republicans did that.
[00:27:10.229 --> 00:27:20.479]  But it has been a victory of the media that the average white person or black person, doesn't matter, actually thinks the Democrats got the civil rights stuff through.
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.142]  Martin Luther King was a Republican.
[00:27:24.952 --> 00:27:33.374]  But again, they've done a really good job of keeping that truth for people, but now black folks, and not just black folks, a lot of people are rediscovering that.
[00:27:33.594 --> 00:27:42.976]  I'm going to shift gears now into the campaign itself and the big developments there, and the incredible Democrat response to the SAVE Act saying, yeah, you've got to show an ID, you're a citizen, to vote.
[00:27:43.516 --> 00:27:47.317]  Democrats have gone from nobody's voting illegal to, hell yeah, illegals are voting, you better let them!
[00:27:48.362 --> 00:27:51.183]  We've got some of the congressional... It's been sold out for a while.
[00:27:51.443 --> 00:27:53.944]  It is pure, deep-earth crystal iodine.
[00:27:54.104 --> 00:27:55.104]  It's so hard to make.
[00:27:55.164 --> 00:27:57.085]  You've got to have DEA-approved labs that do it.
[00:27:57.205 --> 00:28:01.006]  And it takes months and months to break it down in this special patented process.
[00:28:01.546 --> 00:28:03.627]  Nobody else has true nascent iodine.
[00:28:03.947 --> 00:28:09.588]  They put it on the label, but it's still bound to other elements, and it's not fully absorbable to other cells.
[00:28:09.749 --> 00:28:10.609]  It's the missing link.
[00:28:10.729 --> 00:28:14.490]  Even the UN estimates two-plus billion people have cognitive disabilities because of iodine.
[00:28:14.629 --> 00:28:18.949]   deficiency. Up until the 30s we had major IQ reduction because of lack of iodine in
[00:28:18.949 --> 00:28:24.109]   the US food supply, especially in the US Midwest. From the 30s to the early 80s, the government
[00:28:24.109 --> 00:28:30.269]   put crappy iodine in the salt by law. And IQs went up 15 points on average. Burton effects
[00:28:30.269 --> 00:28:32.629]  went way down. And in the early 80s, they took it out again.
[00:28:32.629 --> 00:28:37.049]   This is the deep earth crystal pure, meaning atomic, on the atomic table. And it
[00:28:37.049 --> 00:28:45.395]   goes into the cells at a cellular Survival Shield X2, now available 25% off, InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:28:45.495 --> 00:28:49.396]  Five-star review, or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:28:50.196 --> 00:28:56.117]  All right, I want to cover the waterfront now and the election for the rest of the hour, then I'll get into World War III developments that are massive.
[00:28:56.797 --> 00:29:00.258]  Start of the next hour, then open the phones up, then we'll cover all the other news as well.
[00:29:01.738 --> 00:29:04.840]  Now I've been focusing in on black Americans a little bit today.
[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:07.281]  I want to finish up on that and move to the rest of the election.
[00:29:08.421 --> 00:29:12.003]  Because, look, it doesn't matter if you're black, white, brown.
[00:29:12.604 --> 00:29:21.368]  If you're an American citizen and you pay taxes and you work in the system, bringing in, it's like 50 million illegal aliens the last 15 years.
[00:29:21.808 --> 00:29:22.049]  Okay?
[00:29:22.769 --> 00:29:23.910]  It's 20-something million.
[00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:28.432]  It's not 11, 12 million since Joe Biden stole the election three and a half years ago.
[00:29:30.314 --> 00:29:32.996]  And they are fast-tracking them to social security cards.
[00:29:33.437 --> 00:29:35.438]  They are fast-tracking them to be able to vote.
[00:29:35.759 --> 00:29:38.621]  It's all admitted now, after all the denials.
[00:29:38.681 --> 00:29:53.533]  In fact, that's the compilation we should put together of the last few years of Democrats first denying the border's broken, then saying it's not a problem, then saying it's Trump's fault, then saying illegals aren't voting, and then you can just flip to them now saying, of course illegals are voting, don't be racist.
[00:29:55.114 --> 00:30:14.973]   And in blue cities all over the country, Illegal aliens are being made police officers in New Mexico, in Washington State, in California, in Illinois, and the Democrats say they're going to make them the main military force.
[00:30:15.353 --> 00:30:25.838]  And it's not that I hate people wanting to come here, predominantly Latin Americans, it's that they're coming from socialist and communist countries and they are being put on a government, deep state, Democratic Party titty.
[00:30:27.563 --> 00:30:29.404]  The minute they get here, it's shoved in their mouth.
[00:30:30.024 --> 00:30:35.265]  And they are being enrolled into the system and being told, here's your voter registration card.
[00:30:35.285 --> 00:30:35.886]  It's in the news.
[00:30:36.126 --> 00:30:36.966]  I'm going to cover it in a moment.
[00:30:38.066 --> 00:30:43.308]  So it is so seismic to have them go from denying this all these years.
[00:30:45.068 --> 00:30:46.949]  In fact, I made that compilation too complex.
[00:30:47.729 --> 00:30:49.590]  And not that McBreen can't do it.
[00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:50.270]  He's super complex.
[00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:50.890]  It'll take too long.
[00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:52.230]  I know McBreen's listening.
[00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:52.791]  Hey, McBreen.
[00:30:54.565 --> 00:30:55.245]  Because I want it today.
[00:30:56.106 --> 00:30:59.328]  Just get five clips of Democrats saying, no illegals are voting.
[00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:01.230]  Just five.
[00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:05.573]  And then, I'm about to play eight clips here, if they're on the computer list.
[00:31:05.593 --> 00:31:07.434]  You can get today's list, McBrain, Darren.
[00:31:08.215 --> 00:31:11.577]  And just add quick clips of the Democrats saying, of course illegals can vote.
[00:31:12.938 --> 00:31:17.901]  I just want Democrats saying, no illegals are voting, it's insane, you're racist, no one's doing this too.
[00:31:17.921 --> 00:31:18.522]  Of course we are!
[00:31:18.542 --> 00:31:20.063]  I mean, that is amazing.
[00:31:23.922 --> 00:31:43.316]  You got 50 million illegals in this country, and most of them don't even pay taxes, and they go out and they work, and there's all these Americans that want jobs, but as Ross Perot warned, you bring a giant third world population in, they will lower the wages, and you have inflation on top of that, that is incredibly destructive.
[00:31:43.356 --> 00:32:05.621]   So, the illegals are not making this country stronger, they're making it weaker, and black folks can specifically see they're losing their jobs, or getting their hours cut, And like take Chicago and a bunch of other examples, we can play the newscast we have, where they'll just announce, sorry, no more after school programs at the elementary, middle school and high school for kids.
[00:32:08.542 --> 00:32:11.283]  We're going to house illegal aliens in the gymnasiums now.
[00:32:12.904 --> 00:32:18.726]  And you see the black parents at the school board saying, listen, me and my husband work two jobs.
[00:32:19.106 --> 00:32:20.927]  We don't get home most nights till eight o'clock.
[00:32:21.929 --> 00:32:31.535]  My son, my daughter, are at the school playing basketball, or in track, or in wrestling, or in other events, or in a library club, and they're doing great and they're safe.
[00:32:32.275 --> 00:32:33.676]  In our neighborhoods, they're dangerous.
[00:32:33.736 --> 00:32:35.417]  We pick them up at 7 o'clock at night.
[00:32:35.797 --> 00:32:37.258]  You cannot do this.
[00:32:38.059 --> 00:32:39.760]  And Chicago is just the best example.
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:44.863]  You can type in, Chicago closes after-school programs to make room for migrants.
[00:32:44.883 --> 00:32:48.585]  And then you say, you know, go home at 3.30 and get shot in the street by a gangbanger.
[00:32:50.427 --> 00:33:10.777]  So for any disadvantaged community, particularly black folks, and poor Hispanics, and poor black folks, you take away their after-school programs, you have just devastated those families, and you have stuck their children on the way home, and before their parents get home, with the gangbangers.
[00:33:11.637 --> 00:33:23.548]   And let's make no mistake, because I've been around the block, I've been around the country, The black folks that work, and that's the majority of them, are working two, three jobs like other hard workers.
[00:33:23.908 --> 00:33:25.549]  And they're not getting home until seven or eight at night.
[00:33:25.849 --> 00:33:26.950]  And they're working on Saturday.
[00:33:28.591 --> 00:33:35.394]  And if, if, and just try to pay their bills, and you bring in all these illegals, it is devastating.
[00:33:36.434 --> 00:33:41.477]  And then you give them all of this free stuff, way more than citizens get, it bankrupts the country.
[00:33:41.877 --> 00:33:42.537]  That is the plan.
[00:33:42.557 --> 00:33:49.701]  And then you exempt the illegal aliens from shots that you try to force other Americans of every color to do.
[00:33:50.901 --> 00:33:53.843]  Think about how the illegal aliens are exempt from the pressure.
[00:33:54.003 --> 00:33:56.864]  They're still firing police in New York that don't take the shot.
[00:33:58.185 --> 00:33:58.605]  There it is.
[00:33:59.065 --> 00:34:03.007]  Chicago shelters will start evicting migrants if a 60-day rule goes into effect.
[00:34:03.307 --> 00:34:04.208]  Now where are they going to go?
[00:34:05.748 --> 00:34:14.016]  And I've got newscasts from around the country where just all of a sudden thousands of illegal aliens just show up in small towns and they don't even know how to speak English.
[00:34:14.257 --> 00:34:15.558]  There's no infrastructure for them.
[00:34:15.938 --> 00:34:17.740]  They don't know what to do.
[00:34:18.861 --> 00:34:22.865]  So let's air this clip on Charlemagne's show.
[00:34:22.885 --> 00:34:26.208]  He's got a doctor on there, a black doctor explaining it to him.
[00:34:26.249 --> 00:34:26.549]  Here it is.
[00:34:28.064 --> 00:34:37.169]  Whenever you talk about what the black activists in Chicago are going through, or whenever you talk about what black people here in New York are complaining about, they'll say, that's MAGA messaging.
[00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:38.250]  How is it MAGA messaging?
[00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:39.151]  It's not MAGA messaging.
[00:34:39.391 --> 00:34:49.277]  Listen, the bottom line is when Joe Biden got elected, he said he wanted to fast track four million undocumented residents to full citizenship.
[00:34:50.137 --> 00:34:51.639]  Black people completely ignored it.
[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:52.820]  I spoke on it.
[00:34:53.181 --> 00:34:55.323]  I said, do you know why he went to fast track for a million?
[00:34:55.704 --> 00:34:57.306]  Because he know he not going to do nothing for us.
[00:34:57.746 --> 00:34:59.669]  We ain't going to be motivated to vote for him November.
[00:35:00.029 --> 00:35:05.496]  So what he's going to do is have these migrants already set up with citizenship so they can replace the black vote that he loses.
[00:35:05.936 --> 00:35:12.080]  The migrants are being put in our communities on purpose, New York and Chicago on purpose, because they are what?
[00:35:12.281 --> 00:35:14.042]  The two blackest cities in America.
[00:35:14.382 --> 00:35:16.363]  They're the two largest cities in America.
[00:35:16.584 --> 00:35:19.686]  They're the two most politically conscious black communities in America.
[00:35:19.966 --> 00:35:27.391]  So if we can wash out the black with the brown in New York, if we can wash out the black with the brown in Chicago, Philly don't stand a chance.
[00:35:27.691 --> 00:35:28.832]  Atlanta don't stand a chance.
[00:35:29.273 --> 00:35:32.715]  LA, Houston, Dallas, Detroit, Chicago don't stand a chance.
[00:35:32.895 --> 00:35:34.196]  The migrants are here for three reasons.
[00:35:34.456 --> 00:35:40.295]   replace us at the polls, replace us at the low-end industry jobs, right?
[00:35:40.295 --> 00:35:46.016]   See, when Donald Trump said during the debate that Joe Biden is taking black jobs and giving
[00:35:46.016 --> 00:35:48.336]  them to migrants, he was correct.
[00:35:48.336 --> 00:35:50.416]   Although he didn't say it because he cared about us, but he's right.
[00:35:50.416 --> 00:35:52.376]  When people say, "What do you mean by black jobs?"
[00:35:52.376 --> 00:35:55.256]  Get out your bougie feelings and deal with the reality.
[00:35:55.256 --> 00:35:57.295]  One third of black men have a felony.
[00:35:57.295 --> 00:35:59.256]  So there's a lot of jobs they will never qualify for.
[00:35:59.466 --> 00:36:00.407]  They are mostly what?
[00:36:00.607 --> 00:36:04.669]  Essential workers, warehouse, trucking, security.
[00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:06.531]  And a lot of those jobs are going to who?
[00:36:06.871 --> 00:36:07.671]  The migrants.
[00:36:08.092 --> 00:36:09.793]  So that's what he meant by black jobs.
[00:36:09.813 --> 00:36:12.874]  We gotta stop being so sensitive and look at the reality of it.
[00:36:13.155 --> 00:36:14.435]  I was reading a report the other day.
[00:36:14.455 --> 00:36:19.458]  They said the Latinos taking over the construction jobs.
[00:36:19.838 --> 00:36:20.559]  They're taking them over.
[00:36:21.299 --> 00:36:25.342]  And the low industry work, like your gardening, your landscaping, completely taking it over.
[00:36:25.902 --> 00:36:29.265]  I love how he's got to throw in, though, Trump doesn't care about the black people.
[00:36:30.286 --> 00:36:33.929]  So he stands up for everybody, including you, and then he didn't do it because he cares.
[00:36:34.749 --> 00:36:36.751]  Trump has always cared about workers.
[00:36:36.771 --> 00:36:37.832]  He cares about prosperity.
[00:36:38.212 --> 00:36:39.854]  His businesses are hospitality.
[00:36:40.574 --> 00:36:41.275]  That's just wrong.
[00:36:41.935 --> 00:36:49.321]  Somebody stands up for you, and then you just throw a little thing in about, well, you know, I'm not really defending Trump, even though, you know, he's standing up to this.
[00:36:49.862 --> 00:36:50.322]  That's wrong.
[00:36:50.883 --> 00:36:51.483]  It needs to stop.
[00:36:52.003 --> 00:36:53.525]  Here's another clip before I get to the huge news.
[00:36:55.131 --> 00:36:57.172]  This is West African illegals.
[00:36:57.192 --> 00:36:59.793]  See, I don't care if they're white, brown, or black being brought in by the left.
[00:37:00.394 --> 00:37:01.894]  They're there to take everybody's jobs.
[00:37:02.555 --> 00:37:05.416]  So here is West African illegals invading Cincinnati.
[00:37:05.736 --> 00:37:07.517]  We don't know where they're from.
[00:37:07.657 --> 00:37:09.498]  We don't know how to communicate with them.
[00:37:09.738 --> 00:37:10.519]  This is Local Fox.
[00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:17.232]  We just had a thousand Africans show up in the community.
[00:37:17.672 --> 00:37:22.934]  Mauritanians from West Africa finding their way to Cincinnati, piling in here.
[00:37:23.094 --> 00:37:26.755]  But a hundred came to our doors last Friday and we're wiped out of food.
[00:37:28.496 --> 00:37:30.837]  It was a laborious process to help.
[00:37:31.397 --> 00:37:37.982]  We don't know where they're from, we don't know how to communicate with them, and it created quite an issue for us.
[00:37:38.542 --> 00:37:43.846]  This population is finding its way to Cincinnati from a new route posted on TikTok and WhatsApp.
[00:37:44.207 --> 00:37:55.035]  An immigration loophole in Nicaragua allows relaxed entry requirements and makes a low-cost visa available for purchase without proof of onward travel.
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.301]  And it's all paid for by the State Department and U.N.
[00:37:58.321 --> 00:37:58.421]  money.
[00:37:58.441 --> 00:38:00.523]  They give them debit cards.
[00:38:00.583 --> 00:38:01.523]  And I look at the numbers.
[00:38:01.343 --> 00:38:05.023]   southern border. They travel all the way, they go into Turkey, then Colombia, El
[00:38:05.023 --> 00:38:09.622]   Salvador, Nicaragua, you name it. Then they make their way to our southern
[00:38:09.622 --> 00:38:13.782]   border and then after crossing into the US seeking asylum, they are settling in
[00:38:13.782 --> 00:38:18.702]   Laughlin. And it's all paid for by the State Department and UN money. They give
[00:38:18.702 --> 00:38:23.423]   them debit cards and I look at the numbers. If you think black folks and
[00:38:23.423 --> 00:38:29.103]   white folks, working folks aren't having problems with illegal aliens from Latin America,
[00:38:29.159 --> 00:38:39.944]  They get along compared to the African migrants, as they call them, who show up with no education, no nothing, no American culture, and where do they go?
[00:38:40.164 --> 00:38:41.164]  Right into the black community.
[00:38:41.684 --> 00:38:46.584]   And the black people are like, sitting there, Trying to work, trying to live, trying to take care of their kids.
[00:38:46.624 --> 00:38:50.809]  They already got gangbangers and criminals defunding the police and all the rest of it.
[00:38:50.829 --> 00:38:56.114]  And now thousands of Africans just show up and people are like, what the hell is this?
[00:38:56.195 --> 00:38:57.596]  What are we supposed to do with these people?
[00:38:58.697 --> 00:38:59.979]  I don't care if you're black or white.
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:03.442]  This never really happened to me, but I know other people it's happened to.
[00:39:03.462 --> 00:39:05.505]  Your 20 year old kid won't move out, won't get a job.
[00:39:07.403 --> 00:39:09.184]  Well, just a matter of care if it's white or black.
[00:39:09.204 --> 00:39:15.427]  You're just sitting in your neighborhood and these people just get dropped in the middle of it, and you're supposed to take care of them, and like, what are we going to do with these people?
[00:39:17.488 --> 00:39:18.228]  This is crazy.
[00:39:19.469 --> 00:39:22.450]  This is absolutely crazy.
[00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:35.857]  I mean, if I lived in, you know, in some small town or even some big city, and it's nothing but white people, let's just say, and all of a sudden, a thousand white people show up from some other country, don't even speak English, don't have jobs, and are wandering around, I'm going to say, what the hell is this?
[00:39:38.607 --> 00:39:49.097]  So, and I get it, black folks get upset when all of a sudden a bunch of rich Californian white people move into their neighborhood, say in East Austin.
[00:39:49.537 --> 00:39:55.063]  Not fancy, but nice, pretty trees, nice little houses, been there forever, got good jobs, living good.
[00:39:55.703 --> 00:40:00.768]  All of a sudden all these rich whites show up, buy the property, make it three times more expensive, push the blacks out.
[00:40:00.808 --> 00:40:01.729]  That's called gentrification.
[00:40:04.309 --> 00:40:06.230]  Well, this is even worse than gentrification.
[00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:14.114]  Because at least, okay, you're getting pushed out, you got your house, you've lived in for three generations, but at least you can sell it, get some money, and move somewhere else.
[00:40:14.754 --> 00:40:20.417]  But poorer people show up in your neighborhood, and they drive it even down even more, now you're completely screwed.
[00:40:21.677 --> 00:40:25.059]  So I've been explaining this, but listeners don't need me to explain this.
[00:40:25.919 --> 00:40:29.021]  People are living this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:30.643 --> 00:40:39.750]  We're all experiencing this, and this is meant to destabilize via cloward and pivot, look up that term, cloward and pivot strategy, to destroy this country.
[00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:42.452]  And it's the same thing that's being done all over the world.
[00:40:43.972 --> 00:40:50.612]   All right, I've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[00:40:50.612 --> 00:40:54.532]  Ten of these.
[00:40:54.782 --> 00:40:55.923]  We won't be able to get to them all.
[00:40:56.823 --> 00:40:57.604]  But they are incredible.
[00:40:58.991 --> 00:41:04.933]  Now, for new listeners, or even regular listeners, even myself, I'm trying to even get this straight in my head, this level of gaslighting.
[00:41:05.553 --> 00:41:23.300]  You've heard for decades illegals aren't voting, as Democrat-controlled sanctuary cities, over a thousand cities and towns, plus, I say that because it was 800 a decade ago, it was 1,200 a year ago, I don't know, it's over 1,200 cities and towns, all the major cities, are sanctuary cities.
[00:41:24.994 --> 00:41:39.361]  Whether you're in Utah, or whether you're in New York, whether you're in Texas, or whether you're in Florida, every damn city is Democrat-run, and the illegal aliens get there, and they're above the law, and they commit rapes, and robberies, and murders, and they're let out of jail.
[00:41:39.601 --> 00:41:42.022]  I've got so many articles a day, I can't even keep track of it.
[00:41:42.502 --> 00:41:49.686]  Deported five, six times, raped, armed robbery, they murder some five-year-old kid, rape him to death.
[00:41:50.446 --> 00:41:51.947]  I mean, this is crazy!
[00:41:53.666 --> 00:41:56.808]  Because the world is dumping its criminals on us.
[00:41:57.969 --> 00:41:59.169]  That is a weapon system.
[00:41:59.189 --> 00:41:59.810]  That's an attack.
[00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:04.032]  And then suddenly the Democrats are like, we're not going to let you pass the SAVE Act.
[00:42:04.152 --> 00:42:06.574]  Even if you pass it, Biden's going to veto it.
[00:42:06.954 --> 00:42:09.596]  But you've got to show an ID when you vote?
[00:42:10.236 --> 00:42:13.038]  You're supposed to show a vaccine passport to go to the Walmart.
[00:42:13.578 --> 00:42:14.499]  That's unconstitutional.
[00:42:15.119 --> 00:42:16.960]  You're supposed to show all your ID to fly on a plane.
[00:42:17.161 --> 00:42:19.142]  The illegals are just, we've shown you hundreds of videos.
[00:42:19.342 --> 00:42:20.903]  They just load them right on, no ID needed.
[00:42:22.093 --> 00:42:24.856]  This is all an attack on citizens of this country.
[00:42:24.876 --> 00:42:31.404]  We have to stop calling ourselves black or white, but Americans, and come together and defend ourselves.
[00:42:31.484 --> 00:42:32.946]  And that's what Trump's trying to do.
[00:42:34.168 --> 00:42:37.652]  So here's Representative Summer Lee, Democrat of PA.
[00:42:38.743 --> 00:42:43.586]  Says that requiring only American citizens vote is a xenophobic attack.
[00:42:43.666 --> 00:42:44.866]  And then we'll go to the next clip.
[00:42:45.507 --> 00:42:55.592]  Representative Terry Sewell, Democrat, Alabama, says the bill requiring only citizens to vote is dangerous and a Democratic bill that has no place on the floor.
[00:42:55.792 --> 00:43:00.874]  No, letting illegals come in and illegally vote and displace citizens is dangerous.
[00:43:02.535 --> 00:43:07.698]  Representative Joseph Morrell, Democrat, New York, wait till you see what he says.
[00:43:08.971 --> 00:43:14.493]  Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat in New York, says you can't only let Americans vote.
[00:43:14.513 --> 00:43:15.894]  You gotta let the illegals vote.
[00:43:16.194 --> 00:43:21.376]  So, on a dime, Representative Danielle Ramirez, same crap.
[00:43:22.116 --> 00:43:23.397]  They're all reading the same script.
[00:43:23.497 --> 00:43:24.637]  I mean, wait, wait a minute.
[00:43:25.497 --> 00:43:33.400]  Trump got indicted in Georgia for saying he knew illegals voted, which he had the intel and was true, and they used illegals voting in the names of dead people.
[00:43:33.581 --> 00:43:34.301]  Now they just vote.
[00:43:35.697 --> 00:43:37.438]  And they indicted him for saying that.
[00:43:37.458 --> 00:43:39.179]  If he was wrong, he has a right to say it.
[00:43:39.519 --> 00:43:40.240]  But he was right.
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:46.663]  They indicted him for saying this, and now they just flipped and said, well, damn right they're going to vote, and you ain't going to stop them.
[00:43:47.644 --> 00:43:54.108]  The feds put out an announcement just yesterday saying, we're not going to charge any illegal that votes if they believe they were allowed to.
[00:43:54.328 --> 00:43:57.370]  Well, they're being told they're supposed to as part of being able to stay here.
[00:43:57.570 --> 00:44:09.194]   That's why Biden put out their Immigration hearings five to seven years, but they're watched by the Democratic handlers and these law firms.
[00:44:09.494 --> 00:44:20.741]  If they don't do what they're told, donate where they're told, let them suck off of them, because they get part of their paycheck, they don't become Democrat Party operatives, they then get deported.
[00:44:20.842 --> 00:44:22.963]  That's the power the deep state has over them.
[00:44:23.203 --> 00:44:24.124]  It's the same thing in Europe.
[00:44:24.324 --> 00:44:25.785]  So just play these clips back-to-back.
[00:44:25.825 --> 00:44:26.145]  Here it is.
[00:44:27.148 --> 00:44:27.809]  Hypotheticals.
[00:44:28.229 --> 00:44:32.473]  It is under attack right now, right here, with this very bill.
[00:44:32.933 --> 00:44:36.496]  Republicans want to throw up barriers because when people vote, they lose.
[00:44:36.916 --> 00:44:39.739]  Let me be clear, they don't want you to vote.
[00:44:40.219 --> 00:44:44.903]  They don't want to hear black voices, brown voices, LGBTQIA voices, young voices.
[00:44:45.324 --> 00:44:48.186]  Our fundamental access to our democracy is being politicized.
[00:44:48.767 --> 00:44:53.611]  And this xenophobic attack that we're debating today will make it harder for Americans to vote.
[00:44:53.791 --> 00:44:59.470]   My Republican colleagues will claim that requiring IDs is a small ask, but nearly 30 million people
[00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:04.671]   lack a valid driver's license, and about 15 to 18 million adults don't have access to documents
[00:45:04.671 --> 00:45:11.231]   proving their birth or citizenship. Americans don't need more hospitals. It's already hard enough.
[00:45:11.231 --> 00:45:17.309]   That's why I'm proud. And to advance it, John Lewis didn't give up and neither will we. Mr.
[00:45:17.309 --> 00:45:25.309]   Speaker, House Republicans' so-called SAVE Act is a dangerous, anti-democratic bill that has no place
[00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:26.751]  on this floor.
[00:45:26.903 --> 00:45:33.868]  It is for that reason that at the appropriate time I will be offering a motion to recommit this bill back to the committee.
[00:45:34.468 --> 00:45:39.492]  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the motion to recommit.
[00:45:40.052 --> 00:45:42.173]  Thank you and I yield back the balance of my time.
[00:45:43.654 --> 00:45:46.997]  Mr. Speaker, may I make an inquiry as to the amount of time we have remaining on our side?
[00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:55.394]  Republicans is for them to lay the groundwork to undermine the outcome of the presidential election just as they did four years ago.
[00:45:55.914 --> 00:46:04.299]  Just as they will again and again until they realize either the futility of this exercise or the Republic crumbles.
[00:46:04.959 --> 00:46:05.940]  I pray for the former.
[00:46:07.661 --> 00:46:09.782]  Only citizens can vote for the United States Senate.
[00:46:10.202 --> 00:46:14.805]  Only citizens can vote for the presidency of the United States.
[00:46:16.445 --> 00:46:24.630]  So this extreme Republican voter suppression bill is not designed to solve any problem on behalf of the American people.
[00:46:26.551 --> 00:46:33.876]  It is designed to jam people up and prevent Americans from voting.
[00:46:34.818 --> 00:46:45.001]  The extreme Republican voter suppression to investigate claims of voter fraud by non-citizens was disbanded without identifying one single case.
[00:46:45.781 --> 00:46:53.984]  If we believe in the power of democracy, we should reject discriminatory rules rooted in fear and division and instead increase protections and expand access.
[00:46:54.384 --> 00:46:56.024]  This bill, they call it the SAVE Act.
[00:46:56.324 --> 00:46:58.725]  It should be called the Don't Let Americans Act.
[00:46:59.585 --> 00:47:01.045]  Don't let Americans Vote Act.
[00:47:01.285 --> 00:47:05.506]  And so I rise here opposing and asking my colleagues to vote no on this bill.
[00:47:05.786 --> 00:47:06.387]  I yield.
[00:47:06.867 --> 00:47:09.007]  This bill is essentially a poll tax.
[00:47:09.827 --> 00:47:16.109]  Because I am not aware of a single proof of citizenship document that does not cost an individual money to get it.
[00:47:16.849 --> 00:47:21.710]  Unless we are requiring every state to provide one for free, and then it's an unfunded mandate.
[00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:28.272]  This is the 2024 version of the Jim Crow poll tax, and we should vote against it.
[00:47:29.793 --> 00:47:30.393]  Yeah, right.
[00:47:31.874 --> 00:47:33.135]  You can look at the news everywhere.
[00:47:33.175 --> 00:47:34.917]  Now they're like, let illegals vote.
[00:47:34.997 --> 00:47:36.418]  Hire illegals as police.
[00:47:36.678 --> 00:47:37.719]  It's happening.
[00:47:38.679 --> 00:47:39.320]  And they admit.
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:44.804]  Hell, I played the clips here of Democrats on TV.
[00:47:44.884 --> 00:47:47.646]  Hell, AOC said it a month ago.
[00:47:48.766 --> 00:47:57.552]  We have to get more illegals in because that's going to get us more congressional seats.
[00:47:58.456 --> 00:48:05.419]  Because even if they don't vote, they then do a census, and they count that for the population, so those Democrat jurisdictions get more congressional seats.
[00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:08.581]  And that's the fraud right there on its face!
[00:48:10.441 --> 00:48:22.587]  They're hiring illegal aliens as police officers, and they're hiring them, admitting that their shortfalls in recruiting, after they purge the military, will be filled with illegal aliens.
[00:48:25.083 --> 00:48:26.444]  But in New York, they know what's going on.
[00:48:26.464 --> 00:48:27.865]  AOC gets heckled everywhere.
[00:48:28.545 --> 00:48:32.968]  At town halls, people saying all you care about is illegal aliens.
[00:48:33.008 --> 00:48:35.630]  And they're using them as well.
[00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.971]  Alright.
[00:48:38.451 --> 00:48:40.693]  We're going to start the next hour, we're going to the World War 3 news.
[00:48:40.733 --> 00:48:41.473]  It's the biggest yet.
[00:48:42.374 --> 00:48:43.835]  We've got more on politics as well.
[00:48:45.096 --> 00:48:45.456]  Report.
[00:48:45.996 --> 00:48:49.098]  Convicted felon Hunter Biden is now Joe Biden's acting chief of staff.
[00:48:49.238 --> 00:48:51.560]  Even NBC News is reporting that, which he is.
[00:48:53.786 --> 00:48:59.750]  Michael Douglas pushed Biden to sharp his attack just a month ago, now says he's deeply concerned.
[00:49:01.931 --> 00:49:04.333]  Michael Douglas, what a joke, just like George Clooney.
[00:49:04.613 --> 00:49:07.155]  Who cares about what George Clooney says?
[00:49:07.935 --> 00:49:19.984]  In New Oceans 14, listen to this movie, George Clooney pulls off 30 million heists by tricking people into giving money to political politician before revealing he's demented.
[00:49:20.284 --> 00:49:23.326]  They love to rub our noses in it.
[00:49:24.744 --> 00:49:27.366]  What an incredible time to be alive.
[00:49:27.406 --> 00:49:31.928]  That's all coming up next hour.
[00:49:32.209 --> 00:49:34.430]  Oh, it's now breaking in major respected studies.
[00:49:35.271 --> 00:49:37.092]  COVID shots trigger hepatitis.
[00:49:37.112 --> 00:49:39.573]  That's what they call it when your liver gets eaten.
[00:49:39.793 --> 00:49:40.874]  Just another name for it.
[00:49:41.454 --> 00:49:43.436]  Big stack of news on that front.
[00:49:44.216 --> 00:49:48.639]  City of Sacramento threatens to fine Target stores for calling cops on shoplifters.
[00:49:49.279 --> 00:49:50.220]  That's all coming up.
[00:49:51.761 --> 00:49:58.846]  And I'm going to open the phones up next hour, ladies and gentlemen, ahead of a special guest in the third hour today.

[00:51:38.851 --> 00:51:40.192]  drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:51:40.212 --> 00:51:40.752]  Just one word.
[00:51:41.312 --> 00:51:44.274]  drjonesnaturals.com or infowarestore.com.
[00:51:44.734 --> 00:51:46.414]  Hour number two, straight ahead.
[00:51:46.655 --> 00:51:51.775]   Explain how the central bank digital currency, ESG controlled corporate governance,
[00:51:51.775 --> 00:51:55.975]   controlling what you can do and spend in corporations, governments, private individuals,
[00:51:55.975 --> 00:51:59.695]   how they use that as the next bubble with a unified ledger.
[00:51:59.695 --> 00:52:04.975]   This is key because their bridge to get out of this bubble is the next level of total control
[00:52:04.975 --> 00:52:09.135]   to take a giant slice of everybody's life, but not call it a bail-in,
[00:52:09.135 --> 00:52:13.014]  just call it a social credit score.
[00:52:13.014 --> 00:52:18.774]   Yeah, so let me, if I may, put this into the context of you
[00:52:18.774 --> 00:52:20.734]  and what you've gone through in this.
[00:52:20.734 --> 00:52:25.054]   This bankruptcy that you've had to go through and everything happening with Infowars.
[00:52:25.325 --> 00:52:30.006]  You know, they didn't like what you had to say, so they froze you from your bank accounts.
[00:52:30.106 --> 00:52:31.907]  You couldn't access your money, right?
[00:52:33.787 --> 00:52:36.468]  But that took a legal process to get to that point.
[00:52:36.969 --> 00:52:40.550]  This is that exact same scenario.
[00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:43.972]  Them separating you from your money, but without a legal process.
[00:52:44.532 --> 00:52:46.093]  They can just do it because they don't like you.
[00:52:46.513 --> 00:52:47.994]  Because they don't like your ideology.
[00:52:48.014 --> 00:52:48.494]  Now, slow down.
[00:52:48.514 --> 00:52:49.555]  That's the key, Dr. Elliott.
[00:52:49.795 --> 00:52:51.856]  This is a central bank ledger.
[00:52:51.876 --> 00:52:53.156]  It just sounds like a term people know.
[00:52:53.276 --> 00:52:54.457]  Everyone is in bankruptcy.
[00:52:54.477 --> 00:52:56.978]  Private companies, corporations, the general public.
[00:52:56.998 --> 00:52:57.418]  That's what they say.
[00:52:57.438 --> 00:52:58.339]  They'll owe nothing and like it.
[00:52:58.699 --> 00:53:00.500]  And then they unify it and take what they want.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:01.580]  Your mortgage.
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:02.681]  Everything is unified.
[00:53:03.121 --> 00:53:03.542]  Everything.
[00:53:03.882 --> 00:53:17.338]  See, every asset that you have that's in this digital form, whether it's a bank account, checking account, savings account, money market, stock bond, mutual fund, brokerage account, all of that stuff, and anything with a title like your house, right?
[00:53:17.378 --> 00:53:19.401]  You can be put into this unified ledger.
[00:53:20.121 --> 00:53:37.088]  Now, the World Economic Forum has explained this really well in the sense of this is digital money, it's programmable money, meaning they tokenize or they put all of your assets into a packet and that packet is now can be sold, right?
[00:53:37.108 --> 00:53:38.228]  This is like a derivative.
[00:53:38.608 --> 00:53:45.691]  You can flip off the ownership with a flip of a button saying, okay, Alex, you no longer own all of this stuff that you thought you had.
[00:53:45.971 --> 00:53:52.275]   We're flipping the switch and we're going to give it to Person B, or person C, or to the government, right?
[00:53:52.316 --> 00:53:53.336]  They can do whatever they want.
[00:53:53.397 --> 00:53:56.920]  This is what programmable money and a unified ledger is.
[00:53:57.060 --> 00:54:04.047]  And to make it really dangerous is that it's based on your digital social profile and your social credit score.
[00:54:04.507 --> 00:54:08.331]  Now, we, you know, we're not talking about a dystopian future, right?
[00:54:08.651 --> 00:54:11.374]  We saw this happen with the truckers in Canada.
[00:54:11.954 --> 00:54:19.050]  They, their ideology, their, what they... Oh, the British Prime Minister said if you don't accept military service, we'll just turn your bank account off.
[00:54:19.411 --> 00:54:20.213]  That, two weeks ago.
[00:54:21.331 --> 00:54:22.732]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:54:23.212 --> 00:54:27.895]  So, so all of these things seem to be a stretch in people's minds, right?
[00:54:27.935 --> 00:54:29.657]  It's like, oh, this is the mark of the beast.
[00:54:29.677 --> 00:54:30.577]  This is way down the road.
[00:54:30.917 --> 00:54:32.599]  We've seen it, you know, bank accounts.
[00:54:32.639 --> 00:54:34.640]  You're not covering things that are coming.
[00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:35.941]  This is all being rolled out now.
[00:54:36.401 --> 00:54:43.126]  They have gas station change all over Europe, the U.S., including in Oklahoma and Texas, where you've got to swipe a card to get in the building.
[00:54:43.146 --> 00:54:46.848]  You've got to swipe a card to buy gas just to prove you're even able to buy it.
[00:54:46.968 --> 00:54:48.629]  I mean, it's coming in.
[00:54:49.570 --> 00:54:52.392]   We're not just talking about Freedom here, right?
[00:54:52.452 --> 00:54:55.596]  Financial freedom, getting out of harm's way of these digital assets.
[00:54:55.616 --> 00:54:59.340]  We're also doing something that we get the best of both worlds.
[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:01.602]  Asset protection and growth.
[00:55:02.143 --> 00:55:05.927]  And that's what makes it such an amazing concept right now.
[00:55:06.187 --> 00:55:07.548]  Nothing is performed as good as silver.
[00:55:08.209 --> 00:55:13.131]  And I haven't had a silver or gold sponsor because so many of them sell numismatics, ripping people off.
[00:55:13.171 --> 00:55:17.332]  You are the number one bullion dealer in America right now because you've got the best deals.
[00:55:17.372 --> 00:55:19.132]  Look at that 12-year graph, folks.
[00:55:19.673 --> 00:55:22.814]  This is a no-brainer to protect your assets and probably have growth.
[00:55:22.934 --> 00:55:30.934]   We can't guarantee anything, but my God, you're crazy if you don't call Dr. Kirk Elliott at 720-605-3900.
[00:55:49.934 --> 00:55:53.934]   More calls and a ton of breaking news are coming up after this important promo.
[00:55:54.321 --> 00:55:56.202]  We join some stations in six minutes.
[00:55:56.603 --> 00:55:57.843]  Please stay with us and spread the word.
[00:55:57.923 --> 00:55:58.804]  You are the resistance.
[00:55:59.144 --> 00:56:00.125]  You are the info.
[00:56:00.145 --> 00:56:01.386]  Without you, we are nothing.
[00:56:01.486 --> 00:56:06.365]   When you decide to take action, nothing on earth can stop you because God is behind you.
[00:56:06.365 --> 00:56:20.086]  The answer to 1984 is 1776! 1776! 1776!
[00:56:20.107 --> 00:56:29.474]  1776!
[00:56:23.089 --> 00:56:29.474]  So this fight for America is key, not just for us, but the entire world.
[00:56:29.755 --> 00:56:42.165]   Because if this republic falls, the entire world falls to the UN and the globalists and their hellish plan to literally Take everything you've got, including your children, away from you.
[00:56:42.665 --> 00:56:53.194]  And whether it's Klaus Schwab or Bill Gates or Yuval Noah Harari, they represent the globalist ruling class of the planet who say the future is not human.
[00:56:53.554 --> 00:56:55.156]  Well, we got news for them.
[00:56:55.476 --> 00:56:57.476]  The future is not globalist!
[00:56:57.476 --> 00:57:04.476]  [Cheering]
[00:57:04.476 --> 00:57:06.476]  The future is human.
[00:57:06.847 --> 00:57:12.672]  The lies they spread about Alex, they've tried to take him out more than they've tried to take any of us out.
[00:57:13.232 --> 00:57:14.313]  But let me tell you what it is.
[00:57:14.353 --> 00:57:27.284]  What they'll never say is that Alex Jones has spent 30 years being the loudest voice for freedom, for liberty, and for anti-war that this world has seen.
[00:57:27.564 --> 00:57:31.207]  He stood against them, and that's why they're against him.
[00:57:32.729 --> 00:57:39.094]  They have tried to burn him to the ground, but he won't stop fighting!
[00:57:39.754 --> 00:57:41.416]  Let's launch Team Humanity!
[00:57:44.438 --> 00:57:45.699]  Team Humanity!
[00:57:48.962 --> 00:57:49.382]  Team Humanity!
[00:57:52.064 --> 00:57:56.108]  Are you going to let them brainwash and take your children?
[00:57:58.101 --> 00:58:08.326]  The answer to their 1984 anti-human dehumanization world is humanity coming together and celebrating freedom that God gave us and saying no!
[00:58:08.546 --> 00:58:12.267]  The answer to 1984 is 1776!
[00:58:12.468 --> 00:58:17.570]  So I have a message to the globalists.
[00:58:18.310 --> 00:58:24.493]  I don't know how all this is going to end, but if you want to fight, you better believe you've got one!
[00:58:28.018 --> 00:58:30.341]  They declared war on us.
[00:58:31.181 --> 00:58:32.243]  They're attacking us.
[00:58:32.563 --> 00:58:33.624]  They're surveilling us.
[00:58:33.964 --> 00:58:34.985]  They're censoring us.
[00:58:35.326 --> 00:58:39.030]  They're cutting off our energy, our water, our communications, our freedom.
[00:58:39.330 --> 00:58:43.775]  We're simply recognizing it and saying, we're not going to roll over and die.
[00:58:44.235 --> 00:58:54.743]   Our God is the God of the universe that created all There is a global, worldwide, political realignment against the New World Order.
[00:58:54.783 --> 00:59:05.731]  The New World Order is a couple thousand arrogant people led by King Charles, who sits around and talks about how he wants to depopulate people, and so did his father, Prince Philip.
[00:59:05.751 --> 00:59:11.935]  And I'm telling them right now, we are not rolling over and dying for you inbred globalists.
[00:59:15.589 --> 00:59:36.424]  You will not divide and conquer us any longer, and as long as we never give up, we are invincible!
[00:59:36.444 --> 00:59:37.124]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:59:37.224 --> 00:59:38.605]  Follow us at Real Alex Jones.

[01:00:47.168 --> 01:00:50.270]  Men and women of every race, color, and creed that got souls.
[01:00:51.071 --> 01:00:51.811]  Who are pro-human.
[01:00:52.712 --> 01:00:53.833]  Want to roll over to the New World Order.
[01:00:53.873 --> 01:00:54.433]  Want to fight it.
[01:00:55.774 --> 01:00:56.435]  I'm looking for you.
[01:00:58.556 --> 01:00:59.317]  I'm rooting for you.
[01:00:59.337 --> 01:01:01.178]  We're on the same team.
[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:04.701]  Team Humanity.
[01:01:08.444 --> 01:01:10.065]  Alright, I want to give out the toll-free number.
[01:01:12.446 --> 01:01:14.368]  On any subject you want to bring up.
[01:01:15.629 --> 01:01:25.555]  But we're only going to put about 10 calls to the board because I got a guest coming up next hour on the worldwide attack on free speech and how critical it is and all the big developments that we've done an okay job of covering the last few months.
[01:01:25.815 --> 01:01:26.916]  We've done a great job in the past.
[01:01:26.956 --> 01:01:30.378]  We kind of just kind of think everybody knows there's an attack on free speech, right?
[01:01:30.438 --> 01:01:34.660]  But you need to know how they're doing it and why it's so important and where it's all going.
[01:01:35.241 --> 01:01:37.402]  There's a lot of big developments that's coming up next hour.
[01:01:39.241 --> 01:01:41.681]  But I want to take your calls on any subject you want to raise.
[01:01:41.961 --> 01:01:52.823]  I would imagine callers want to call in about NATO announces they're moving long-range, low-flying cruise missiles and hypersonic missiles up to the Russian border, which is direct provocation.
[01:01:54.444 --> 01:02:01.525]  Imagine if Russia, in Mexico and Canada, rolled a bunch of cruise missiles and other missiles up to our border.
[01:02:01.645 --> 01:02:03.405]  We would be a little upset about that.
[01:02:04.465 --> 01:02:13.423]   And Russia's already sent nuclear submarines off our coast and showed them to us and said, And the old days, Kennedy almost went to war over it, but the Russians did that.
[01:02:13.463 --> 01:02:23.707]  I'm not defending the Russians, they were communists then, but the United States put nuclear missiles in Turkey, Nike missiles, medium-range missiles, and that's why the Russians did that.
[01:02:24.347 --> 01:02:27.148]  So it is the West that is provocating this again.
[01:02:27.989 --> 01:02:29.109]  Very, very dangerous.
[01:02:29.749 --> 01:02:30.990]  I'd like to get your take on that.
[01:02:31.150 --> 01:02:32.210]  The toll-free number is 877.
[01:02:32.590 --> 01:02:33.831]  We'll put it up on screen.
[01:02:34.872 --> 01:02:34.972]  789-2539.
[01:02:34.992 --> 01:02:35.192]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:02:35.212 --> 01:02:35.252]  877-789-2539.
[01:02:35.352 --> 01:02:36.594]  Taking your calls right now.
[01:02:36.414 --> 01:02:46.914]  877-789-ALEX or 877-789-2539 taking your calls right now.
[01:02:46.914 --> 01:02:49.914]  877-789-2539.
[01:02:49.914 --> 01:02:54.914]   Alright, I've mentioned this in the last hour, but let's get into it right now.
[01:02:55.162 --> 01:02:58.082]  This is a big RT article reposted in fullwars.com.
[01:02:58.822 --> 01:03:02.743]  Russia vows military response, close quote, U.S.
[01:03:02.783 --> 01:03:04.103]  missile deployment plans.
[01:03:04.943 --> 01:03:18.826]  And NATO has announced that they're going to start moving missiles, both hypersonic that are more ballistic, go up and then down, and then cruise missiles that fly at tree level, so they're hard to stop with any aircraft.
[01:03:20.228 --> 01:03:30.495]  On the Russian border a serious provocation and Russia says they will calmly and coolly now prepare for this threat with a military response.
[01:03:32.837 --> 01:03:34.938]  So a huge escalation.
[01:03:35.378 --> 01:03:40.722]  Germany explains decision to host US long-range missiles.
[01:03:42.343 --> 01:03:52.689]   The deployment of US long-range missiles to Germany will bring Berlin Time to develop similar weapons of its own, Defense Minister has said.
[01:03:53.890 --> 01:03:57.352]  And they claim because they believe Russia is about to invade Europe.
[01:03:57.733 --> 01:03:59.014]  Europe has nuclear weapons.
[01:03:59.414 --> 01:04:00.735]  They're not going to invade Europe.
[01:04:01.195 --> 01:04:02.676]  Ukraine is where Russia was founded.
[01:04:03.317 --> 01:04:05.198]  The West overthrew their government 11 years ago.
[01:04:05.238 --> 01:04:06.820]  They've been attacking the Russian border.
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:08.901]  They manipulated the Russians into this.
[01:04:10.262 --> 01:04:13.605]  Germany forced to water down compulsory military draft plans.
[01:04:15.117 --> 01:04:29.521]  The German government is being pressured by its junior coalition member, FDP, to throw out the compulsory elements of its upcoming military conscription law, which is set to be implemented sometime this year.
[01:04:30.862 --> 01:04:34.443]  So they're bringing back the draft specifically for war with Russia.
[01:04:34.743 --> 01:04:37.724]  Then you've got this big foreign policy CFR report.
[01:04:38.264 --> 01:04:45.092]   Nine thinkers, big report, on The continent's post-American future.
[01:04:45.733 --> 01:04:48.336]  So they're already saying Trump's gonna win, he'll applaud NATO.
[01:04:48.376 --> 01:04:48.837]  No he won't.
[01:04:49.117 --> 01:04:50.039]  He'll just say the U.S.
[01:04:50.079 --> 01:04:50.920]  isn't paying for it all.
[01:04:54.484 --> 01:04:58.670]  And they're saying we're facing an imminent attack by Russia.
[01:04:59.491 --> 01:05:00.172]  No you're not.
[01:05:00.312 --> 01:05:01.634]  You started a war with Russia.
[01:05:04.045 --> 01:05:05.906]  So, preposterous crap.
[01:05:06.567 --> 01:05:09.109]  Has Russia been going around starting wars the last 20 years?
[01:05:09.249 --> 01:05:10.250]  Or has the United States?
[01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:11.731]  And again, I love our country.
[01:05:12.391 --> 01:05:13.812]  But our country is hijacked.
[01:05:15.033 --> 01:05:20.057]  And that's the reality of what we are facing here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:24.420]  Alright.
[01:05:27.703 --> 01:05:30.805]  Let's talk about something disgusting.
[01:05:32.246 --> 01:05:33.087]  Like cockroaches.
[01:05:34.472 --> 01:05:37.633]  And there's no doubt there's some real weirdness going on here.
[01:05:39.553 --> 01:05:42.134]  But it just shows how revolted the public is by these people.
[01:05:42.754 --> 01:05:56.037]  You have Uma Abedin, who was Hillary's personal assistant and reported girlfriend, who was also married to the pedophile Anthony Weiner, who was reportedly the boyfriend of Chuckie Schumer.
[01:05:57.397 --> 01:06:02.798]  So this is quite a disgusting polyamory going on.
[01:06:04.275 --> 01:06:11.480]  And this is even grosser than Schumer serving raw hamburgers with cold cheese.
[01:06:13.681 --> 01:06:18.044]  I don't, listen, I don't really mind the David Icke stuff, this is all space aliens, but maybe I do.
[01:06:19.165 --> 01:06:25.630]  Who serves raw hamburgers with cheese and says I've never, I've never been in a backyard, I've never made meat before?
[01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:29.012]  I mean, whether they're real aliens or not, they act like aliens.
[01:06:31.081 --> 01:06:34.203]  That's why they think we're so weird that we know how to skin a bucket and run a trot line.
[01:06:34.603 --> 01:06:35.384]  Let me tell you something.
[01:06:36.225 --> 01:06:41.288]  You're having sex with Hillary Clinton, Anthony Weiner, and now Alexander Soros.
[01:06:41.428 --> 01:06:41.968]  You're weird.
[01:06:42.889 --> 01:06:44.850]  That's a lot grosser than eating raw hamburgers.
[01:06:45.351 --> 01:06:55.878]  I'd rather eat raw hamburger meat all day long than be anywhere near Hillary Clinton or Alexander Soros or Anthony Weiner.
[01:06:58.061 --> 01:07:02.066]  So, Uma Abedin and billionaire Alex Soros are engaged.
[01:07:04.028 --> 01:07:06.270]  So is she like a rent-a-beard?
[01:07:06.290 --> 01:07:12.257]  Because look, I'm not mad at Alexander Soros that he's reportedly homosexual.
[01:07:14.299 --> 01:07:15.841]  Or, you know, any of this.
[01:07:17.256 --> 01:07:25.541]  It's that they're raping our freedoms and defunding the police and funding crime waves and putting peaceful conservatives in prison.
[01:07:27.062 --> 01:07:28.984]  Why do they have such chips on their shoulders?
[01:07:30.805 --> 01:07:37.129]  So now Uma Abedin and billionaire Alexander Soros are engaged.
[01:07:39.127 --> 01:07:42.468]  So he's literally marrying in to the Hillary Clinton family.
[01:07:43.349 --> 01:07:47.350]  I posted a joke video, because somebody did like a month ago, AI hell.
[01:07:47.411 --> 01:07:48.371]  I want to roll it with audio.
[01:07:49.471 --> 01:07:56.034]  And AI came up with a horrible image of just like lakes of blood and all these demon human forms writhing in blood.
[01:07:56.714 --> 01:08:05.038]  So I made the joke on Real Alex Jones on X that footage of their wedding reception has leaked, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:05.118 --> 01:08:12.118]  So let's go ahead and roll this with audio, full screen.
[01:08:12.118 --> 01:08:30.118]   By the way, I made a big deal about this because it is a big deal.
[01:08:30.118 --> 01:08:40.118]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:08:31.844 --> 01:08:36.848]  Put the Chuckie Schumer ex-post tweet up from a month ago on Father's Day.
[01:08:37.589 --> 01:08:39.590]  It's so perfectly said, it's so alien.
[01:08:41.091 --> 01:08:43.373]  He says, I've never not lived in a high-rise building.
[01:08:43.433 --> 01:08:44.574]  I've never had a backyard.
[01:08:44.654 --> 01:08:45.936]  I've never been able to barbecue.
[01:08:46.823 --> 01:08:48.864]  Which shows you have no live experience in the real world.
[01:08:49.644 --> 01:08:56.987]  But my daughter's wife has a house, so we were able to cook on a grill.
[01:08:57.507 --> 01:09:06.230]  And then he's serving up in photos, you can zoom in on him, raw hamburger meat with cheese on it.
[01:09:07.591 --> 01:09:11.634]  And it just tells you how disc... And people say, oh, those look great.
[01:09:11.654 --> 01:09:13.315]  No, you zoom in, there's red cracks.
[01:09:13.395 --> 01:09:14.376]  It's just old hamburger.
[01:09:14.937 --> 01:09:16.418]  It's been in the refrigerator for two weeks.
[01:09:16.778 --> 01:09:17.799]  Zoom in on the piece of meat.
[01:09:18.759 --> 01:09:19.700]  You can see the cracks in it.
[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:22.102]  It's raw hamburger.
[01:09:23.823 --> 01:09:25.264]  You can see the grill on low.
[01:09:25.545 --> 01:09:26.645]  Zoom in more.
[01:09:26.685 --> 01:09:27.426]  The cracks in the meat.
[01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:29.307]  Or actually, click on the image itself.
[01:09:29.327 --> 01:09:29.608]  There you go.
[01:09:30.048 --> 01:09:32.450]  That's raw, gray hamburger meat.
[01:09:33.971 --> 01:09:37.893]  With a disgusting piece of American cheese that's not melted.
[01:09:38.013 --> 01:09:39.194]  That's satanic, by the way.
[01:09:39.754 --> 01:09:41.515]  That's an act of satanism right there.
[01:09:41.535 --> 01:09:42.876]  You want to know about blasphemy?
[01:09:43.536 --> 01:09:48.559]  A non-cooked piece of meat should be sizzling, brown and juicy, fat dripping off of it.
[01:09:48.599 --> 01:09:49.159]  I'm getting hungry.
[01:09:49.459 --> 01:09:51.440]  The cheese should be melting perfectly.
[01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:54.722]  A few pieces have to drip into the fire first.
[01:09:55.322 --> 01:09:58.784]  And then you know it's perfect on your sesame seed bun.
[01:09:59.124 --> 01:10:02.726]  There's some lettuce, some onion, some mustard, a little ketchup, maybe a jalapeno.
[01:10:04.923 --> 01:10:06.045]  But that is satanism.
[01:10:07.066 --> 01:10:08.929]  Now, how can he run your con?
[01:10:08.969 --> 01:10:09.630]  This is a big deal.
[01:10:09.690 --> 01:10:14.737]  I mean, if you don't know how to cook a hamburger, folks, that's like not knowing how to wipe your ass.
[01:10:15.257 --> 01:10:19.543]  By the time I was seven, eight years old, my dad would say, I'm going in the house to get some more of this.
[01:10:20.184 --> 01:10:21.947]  Take these burgers off the grill when they're ready.
[01:10:23.254 --> 01:10:24.295]  Hadn't burned meat in years.
[01:10:24.735 --> 01:10:31.939]  Couple weeks ago, I had friends over, and the grill wasn't hot enough, and I walked in the house, like, three minutes, get some iced tea, it flared up in seconds and burned into a crisp.
[01:10:32.299 --> 01:10:33.460]  So you gotta watch a grill.
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:41.144]  But the point is, is that this, ladies and gentlemen, is gray, dead, old meat.
[01:10:41.164 --> 01:10:43.265]  So they don't know how to get fresh hamburger.
[01:10:46.087 --> 01:10:46.967]  I know I'm obsessed on it.
[01:10:47.167 --> 01:10:50.990]  I just may create the properly cooked hamburger party.
[01:10:51.829 --> 01:10:54.331]  I mean, even Bob's big boy would know how to do this, right?
[01:10:55.112 --> 01:10:57.975]  But imagine, could that guy produce something good?
[01:10:58.295 --> 01:10:59.696]  Could he produce something loving?
[01:10:59.976 --> 01:11:01.538]  Could he produce something delicious?
[01:11:01.858 --> 01:11:03.339]  Could he create something wholesome?
[01:11:04.701 --> 01:11:08.944]  No, the cheeseburger, to me, is a religious artifact.
[01:11:09.004 --> 01:11:11.367]  I don't mean that blasphemous, like, God's God.
[01:11:11.407 --> 01:11:13.348]  But, I mean, God gave us the cheeseburger.
[01:11:14.609 --> 01:11:16.191]  I mean, my God, it's as good as the sunset.
[01:11:18.655 --> 01:11:21.096]  I mean, a perfectly made cheeseburger probably tops any food.
[01:11:21.496 --> 01:11:35.675]   To not be able to cook a cheeseburger, and to say, I've never been in a backyard before, shows how disconnected I mean, here's an example.
[01:11:35.955 --> 01:11:37.056]  I put it on X today.
[01:11:37.956 --> 01:11:40.497]  Sotomayor believes all guns should be banned from the general public.
[01:11:40.857 --> 01:11:41.497]  She said it on record.
[01:11:41.917 --> 01:11:44.578]  But she has armed guards 6 of them 24 hours a day.
[01:11:45.338 --> 01:11:46.718]  She's a Supreme Court Justice.
[01:11:46.798 --> 01:11:47.698]  She's important.
[01:11:47.759 --> 01:11:48.819]  She gets armed guards.
[01:11:50.259 --> 01:11:50.939]  But you don't.
[01:11:50.959 --> 01:11:54.240]  And it's the same thing.
[01:11:55.361 --> 01:11:57.321]  They think it's weird for people to own guns.
[01:11:57.341 --> 01:11:58.361]  They think it's weird.
[01:11:58.862 --> 01:12:04.083]  Like, you know how to kill a deer and haul it up and chop it up in 30 minutes and put it in the refrigerator and eat it?
[01:12:05.944 --> 01:12:07.205]  It's like, what is this?
[01:12:09.787 --> 01:12:11.168]  Again, I know I'm harping on this.
[01:12:12.109 --> 01:12:16.672]  And the reason I'm harping on it is, they're like space aliens.
[01:12:16.692 --> 01:12:23.538]  They're not... I have a buddy who has a term, for like third-generational wealthy people, he calls them space aliens.
[01:12:24.399 --> 01:12:27.641]  Because they don't have a care in the world, they don't know how the world works, never had to work a day in their life.
[01:12:27.661 --> 01:12:29.263]  And it's the same thing.
[01:12:29.403 --> 01:12:34.567]  Mick Jagger, this geriatric, got some great music, and I sent him a little good Rolling Stones song.
[01:12:36.829 --> 01:12:37.890]  Give me shelter, you name it.
[01:12:37.930 --> 01:12:40.691]  I mean, my God, Wild Horses Kid dragged me away from a good Rolling Stones song.
[01:12:41.512 --> 01:12:47.695]  But he gets up and starts promoting Justin Trudeau in Canada and gets booed and changes the subject.
[01:12:47.715 --> 01:12:48.695]  Hey, what about football?
[01:12:49.216 --> 01:12:55.519]  But again, it shows how Mick Jagger may have grown up in a regular neighborhood 60 years ago.
[01:12:57.260 --> 01:13:00.142]  But now he's not even a normal person.
[01:13:01.202 --> 01:13:03.644]  But the normal people are rejecting him.
[01:13:03.964 --> 01:13:06.245]  Trudeau has a 15% approval rating.
[01:13:07.745 --> 01:13:12.867]  But Mick Jagger is still there pushing him because he's a Knight of the Crown.
[01:13:13.187 --> 01:13:15.188]  Here he is.
[01:13:15.208 --> 01:13:16.909]  We love your Mr. Trudeau.
[01:13:16.969 --> 01:13:29.354]  I mean, his family has always been such big fans of our fans.
[01:13:29.173 --> 01:13:35.173]   By the way, congratulations on the Canadian soccer team getting to the semi-finals!
[01:13:35.173 --> 01:13:39.173]  Congratulations to the Canadian team!
[01:13:40.173 --> 01:13:45.173]   ...water out of, when we have water bottles, out of a plastic...
[01:13:45.324 --> 01:13:54.327]  I'm sorry away from plastic towards paper Like drink box water bottles sort of things by the way, I asked for this yesterday.
[01:13:54.367 --> 01:13:59.768]  Maybe you told me Can we get I sent you a low HD when I said finally HD.
[01:13:59.788 --> 01:14:04.309]  There's a crisp one I'm saying soon five-year-olds can take the shot and babies.
[01:14:06.190 --> 01:14:13.547]   I Mean this is a joke Okay, the Rolling Stones ripped off black musicians and did a high-quality British production of blues.
[01:14:13.907 --> 01:14:19.012]  Okay, there's some good songs, but they're disgusting old remnants of the New World Order.
[01:14:22.175 --> 01:14:28.974]  Give it up for me for Trudeau, he's so wonderful. Boo! Ahhhh!
[01:14:28.974 --> 01:14:35.614]   You ask me, how is he in control with 15 percent in the last election?
[01:14:35.816 --> 01:14:41.178]  Because in parliaments they got dozens of parties, they create coalitions because he's got the establishment money.
[01:14:43.758 --> 01:14:51.880]  Just like the communist with the establishment just defeated the populace in France.
[01:14:52.181 --> 01:14:53.861]  They're doing it through manipulation.
[01:14:55.532 --> 01:15:00.937]  So if you want to run down two-party systems and it's got a problem, it's much better than parliamentary.
[01:15:02.558 --> 01:15:04.640]  Here is Trudeau promoting poison shots.
[01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:05.361]  These are different clips.
[01:15:05.421 --> 01:15:09.324]  I know there's a bunch of them, but here it is.
[01:15:10.165 --> 01:15:13.188]  Our first question is from Bryn, who is nine years old.
[01:15:16.211 --> 01:15:17.312]  Is the vaccine safe?
[01:15:17.732 --> 01:15:19.514]  Is there any side effects that I should know about?
[01:15:21.628 --> 01:15:23.409]  Oh, great question, Bryn.
[01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:27.172]  What a pleasure to see you and your sister here today.
[01:15:27.192 --> 01:15:34.518]  A lot of people asking that question have been asking that question for about a year as we've been getting Canadians vaccinated.
[01:15:34.538 --> 01:15:37.260]  A lot of people want to know, is the vaccine safe?
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:42.323]  First thing we got to know is vaccines absolutely are safe.
[01:15:42.563 --> 01:15:45.766]  You're going to be able to get your vaccine as soon as you turn five.
[01:15:46.606 --> 01:15:48.787]  And I know you're excited, and I know you're eager.
[01:15:49.467 --> 01:15:56.651]  In some places across the country, you can even start making your appointment now for shortly after your birthday.
[01:15:56.771 --> 01:15:58.652]  Meanwhile, let me show you some headlines.
[01:15:58.712 --> 01:16:00.032]  I'll go to your calls.
[01:16:00.152 --> 01:16:01.213]  Overhead shot, please.
[01:16:01.533 --> 01:16:04.114]  COVID shots trigger hepatitis, the destruction of liver.
[01:16:03.954 --> 01:16:07.353]  This little girl goes on to say arrest people don't take it.
[01:16:07.353 --> 01:16:08.514]  Meanwhile, let me show you some headlines.
[01:16:08.514 --> 01:16:09.274]  I'll go to your calls.
[01:16:09.274 --> 01:16:11.194]  Overhead shot, please.
[01:16:11.194 --> 01:16:14.154]  COVID shots trigger hepatitis, the destruction of liver.
[01:16:14.154 --> 01:16:16.553]  New case study.
[01:16:16.553 --> 01:16:20.274]  COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations are rising in Austin.
[01:16:19.145 --> 01:16:20.365]  Oh, I thought the shots would work.
[01:16:20.385 --> 01:16:29.949]  Pfizer is acquiring drug companies, a problem from chronic diseases caused by their COVID vaccines, including exploding record cancer and blood clots.
[01:16:32.210 --> 01:16:34.411]  And it just goes on from there.
[01:16:34.711 --> 01:16:37.572]  Watch Ben Affleck's daughter say everyone should wear a mask again.
[01:16:38.693 --> 01:16:43.414]  Filipino government reports 290,000 excess deaths correlated to COVID shots.
[01:16:44.175 --> 01:16:44.495]  Official.
[01:16:47.102 --> 01:16:48.443]  COVID vaxxed children.
[01:16:49.244 --> 01:16:52.486]  4,423 times more likely to die than unvaxxed.
[01:16:52.586 --> 01:16:53.547]  Well, that's liberal.
[01:16:54.268 --> 01:16:55.909]  Yes, darling, you didn't get your shot.
[01:16:58.111 --> 01:16:59.892]  RSV vaccine now killing babies.
[01:17:00.313 --> 01:17:00.973]  Bears report.
[01:17:02.815 --> 01:17:07.398]  More disabled Canadians speaking out against pressure to choose just a suicide after vaccine damage.
[01:17:07.618 --> 01:17:09.940]  Well, we didn't kill you the first time, but we're willing to kill you now.
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:14.724]  26,000 signatories are calling to stop the shots from scientists and doctors around the world.
[01:17:15.004 --> 01:17:15.625]  The Hope Accord.
[01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:21.261]  Philadelphia court to hear oral arguments on Merck MMR vaccine fraud case.
[01:17:22.861 --> 01:17:24.522]  And it just goes on and on.
[01:17:25.262 --> 01:17:29.503]  Ex-White House COVID-19 response coordinator admits vaccine mandates are a mistake.
[01:17:32.304 --> 01:17:32.704]  All right.
[01:17:34.664 --> 01:17:36.945]  I'm going to start going to your phone calls right now.
[01:17:38.505 --> 01:17:41.666]  On the whole waterfront, whatever you want to cover, whatever you want to get into.
[01:17:42.286 --> 01:17:44.026]  Let's talk to folks in North Carolina.
[01:17:44.066 --> 01:17:45.027]  Let's talk to Matt.
[01:17:45.187 --> 01:17:45.987]  Matt, you're on the air.
[01:17:46.027 --> 01:17:46.347]  Welcome.
[01:17:47.352 --> 01:17:48.233]  Hey, how you doing Alex?
[01:17:48.533 --> 01:17:48.753]  Good.
[01:17:50.034 --> 01:17:55.818]  I just want to talk about pure state of our media.
[01:17:55.878 --> 01:18:04.684]  It doesn't matter what channel it is, we can't even turn on the channel anymore and watch any type of news without movies yelling like maniacs at our TVs.
[01:18:05.845 --> 01:18:13.911]  Coming from someone who's a normal guy, works a normal job, it's just crazy that our media believes that us Americans are this stupid.
[01:18:16.765 --> 01:18:17.446]  It is insane.
[01:18:17.506 --> 01:18:25.750]  In fact, I can't watch corporate media because the line, and you can switch channels, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, it's the same garbage in the same order.
[01:18:26.890 --> 01:18:34.634]  It is the same stuff, and the fact that, I'm sorry, I'm pro-Russia, I believe that Russia's done nothing wrong.
[01:18:35.314 --> 01:18:36.635]  That's just my personal opinion.
[01:18:37.675 --> 01:18:45.099]  And we, I think we're sticking our foot in our mouth, and I think we're going to walk into something in the next couple months that stops the election.
[01:18:46.658 --> 01:18:52.930]  Well, I mean, look, Biden stole the election three and a half years ago, but he then wouldn't let anybody be in the primary.
[01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:53.691]  He didn't have debates.
[01:18:54.152 --> 01:18:55.074]  So that was a fraud.
[01:18:55.194 --> 01:19:04.893]   And then now it's 100% fraud when they're saying That we'll just appoint whoever we want to replace him, that's unconstitutional, that's illegal.
[01:19:05.273 --> 01:19:08.676]  So, officially if they do that, the election has been cancelled.
[01:19:08.696 --> 01:19:15.281]  They may still put on a show, Trump's following all the rules, but you're right, they are moving towards officially cancelling a real election.
[01:19:15.721 --> 01:19:16.962]  Thank you so much, great points.
[01:19:17.342 --> 01:19:20.585]  Now Larry Pinckney, I've tried to get him on for months, he's been very busy.
[01:19:21.205 --> 01:19:26.630]  He's a real Black Panther, original member, author, researcher, great guy, super smart.
[01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:29.552]  So I hate to even just have him on as a caller.
[01:19:29.912 --> 01:19:33.275]  So while you got Larry, nail him down to come on this week or next week.
[01:19:34.305 --> 01:19:36.226]  Hell, let's get him on tomorrow for a full hour if he can do it.
[01:19:36.667 --> 01:19:38.628]  But we're going to go to break in a few minutes because I don't want to cut him off.
[01:19:38.648 --> 01:19:41.549]  I'm going to go to Larry Pinckney on his take on the situation.
[01:19:41.569 --> 01:19:43.850]  So we're going to get about five minutes, Larry.
[01:19:43.870 --> 01:19:44.911]  A couple minutes to break.
[01:19:44.931 --> 01:19:45.911]  In a few minutes we'll come to you.
[01:19:46.152 --> 01:19:46.432]  Love you.
[01:19:47.052 --> 01:19:49.033]  Let's go ahead and take another caller.
[01:19:50.054 --> 01:19:53.716]  Let's go ahead and talk to David in Wyoming.
[01:19:53.816 --> 01:19:54.836]  David in Wyoming.
[01:19:55.537 --> 01:19:57.358]  You want to talk about an October surprise.
[01:19:57.398 --> 01:19:57.678]  Go ahead.
[01:19:59.338 --> 01:20:00.538]  Yeah, the October surprise.
[01:20:00.558 --> 01:20:08.361]  The first thing I wanted to say, if I can real quick, if you'll give me a chance, is this word that you're throwing out and everybody's face, democracy.
[01:20:08.481 --> 01:20:12.163]  We'll put your heart over your hand to say a pledge of allegiance.
[01:20:12.283 --> 01:20:18.365]  No, we pledge allegiance to the Republic of the United States of America, not the democracy of the United States of America.
[01:20:19.246 --> 01:20:25.288]  The October surprise, Biden's probably going to make, they're probably going to kill him a week before we vote.
[01:20:26.869 --> 01:20:27.389]  There it is.
[01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:29.611]  All the money they don't have to give back.
[01:20:29.831 --> 01:20:33.793]  They can bring in an emergency that's never happened in the United States of America.
[01:20:34.393 --> 01:20:35.774]  Their cover-up's complete.
[01:20:36.395 --> 01:20:37.936]  And that's my two points.
[01:20:38.636 --> 01:20:40.537]  Don't hang up, because I want to respond to you.
[01:20:41.778 --> 01:20:48.622]  I have been on air 30 years, and I have harped on the fact that we're a constitutional republic, a little d, representative democracy.
[01:20:49.699 --> 01:20:52.880]  Okay, so when I use the term, it's anti-democratic.
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:58.141]  We are a democratic system, but we're a republic form of that, and people should learn that.
[01:20:58.521 --> 01:21:02.801]  In a democracy, 51% could vote to make black people slaves again.
[01:21:02.821 --> 01:21:05.242]  Not that they put up with it, but we're all slaves now.
[01:21:05.942 --> 01:21:09.883]  But, so when we talk about that, I have to use the term, people know.
[01:21:09.943 --> 01:21:17.284]  Back when we were on thousands of micro radio stations, I would use the term, we support our pirates, they're great, they're awesome.
[01:21:18.328 --> 01:21:22.530]  Then I would explain that the term pirate is really a micro and their whole argument.
[01:21:22.850 --> 01:21:26.112]  But the general audience out there didn't know what a micro was.
[01:21:26.492 --> 01:21:27.873]  They knew what a pirate was.
[01:21:28.193 --> 01:21:30.294]  So I've got to use the language people are using.
[01:21:30.314 --> 01:21:30.914]  Does that make sense?
[01:21:32.075 --> 01:21:32.655]  Yes, it does.
[01:21:32.775 --> 01:21:35.517]  But like I said, we need to get rid of it because they're two opposites.
[01:21:36.177 --> 01:21:36.657]  No, I agree.
[01:21:36.697 --> 01:21:40.659]  And my mother, my mother rarely gets in my business, but she's almost always right.
[01:21:40.679 --> 01:21:41.980]  In fact, I think she's basically always right.
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:45.622]  She's been saying for three years they're going to kill Biden and blame it on Trump supporters.
[01:21:47.858 --> 01:21:54.265]  I don't know if they'll blame it on Trump supporters, but they'll have a national emergency that's never happened in this nation, and that way they got the cover up.
[01:21:54.285 --> 01:21:55.126]  It's all complete.
[01:21:55.186 --> 01:21:57.329]  They have to have some kind of an emergency to vote in.
[01:21:57.729 --> 01:22:01.253]  Oh, you can't just vote in a Republican, because that's all we have for a candidate.
[01:22:01.794 --> 01:22:03.696]  Sure, but knowing the enemy, David.
[01:22:04.317 --> 01:22:07.881]  They love to recycle stuff, so if they kill Biden, why don't they blame us for it?
[01:22:07.901 --> 01:22:08.742]  That makes perfect sense.
[01:22:10.203 --> 01:22:11.764]  Yeah, but then they got a scandal.
[01:22:11.904 --> 01:22:20.008]  See, this way they've got the, well, I'll say they got the wake and they've got... So he just dies in his sleep and then it's all about poor Biden?
[01:22:21.128 --> 01:22:22.229]  Yep, exactly.
[01:22:22.469 --> 01:22:24.550]  And then everybody goes to the sympathy vote.
[01:22:27.191 --> 01:22:28.572]  I think it's a real possibility.
[01:22:28.612 --> 01:22:29.332]  Thank you, David.
[01:22:29.392 --> 01:22:30.312]  Maybe a probability.
[01:22:30.372 --> 01:22:31.053]  Thank you, David.
[01:22:31.533 --> 01:22:32.473]  All right, we're gonna go to break.
[01:22:32.493 --> 01:22:35.255]  The great Larry Pinckney, super smart guy, good friend of mine.
[01:22:35.275 --> 01:22:37.956]  I'm gonna fly him down here soon, get on the show with us.
[01:22:39.645 --> 01:22:43.952]  Larry Pinckney, a founding member of the Black Panther Party, not the new FBI-run one.
[01:22:44.954 --> 01:22:49.121]  By the way, grab out of yesterday's stack where the documents came out, the feds are running the white supremacist.
[01:22:49.141 --> 01:22:51.105]  I want to bring it up with Larry Pinckney, straight ahead, stay with us.
[01:22:52.284 --> 01:22:58.347]  Whether it's the World Economic Forum, whether it's the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, whether it's Open Philanthropy and Dustin Moskowitz.
[01:22:58.407 --> 01:23:04.030]  We know that all of these organizations thought that they could bamboozle all of us.
[01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:09.173]  They thought that by putting fact checkers on every post, we'd stop sharing posts.
[01:23:09.633 --> 01:23:13.555]  They thought by canceling people, that we wouldn't actually listen to people's voices.
[01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:17.096]   But the bad news is for them, We continue to do it.
[01:23:17.497 --> 01:23:19.317]  So what are the simple things that you can do?
[01:23:19.677 --> 01:23:25.699]  The simple things you can do, like I said before, support the alternative platforms that are allowing these voices to be heard.
[01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:28.501]  Make sure that you actually have these conversations.
[01:23:28.641 --> 01:23:33.502]  Without the utility of this voice and this platform, we will lose the war.
[01:23:33.922 --> 01:23:35.303]  So our job is really simple.
[01:23:35.743 --> 01:23:40.785]  Well, we should praise God and be thankful the globalists are being exposed and are in deep trouble.
[01:23:40.965 --> 01:23:45.387]  Now, we haven't won the war against their tyranny, but at least we're fighting back.
[01:23:45.207 --> 01:23:49.207]  Donate and share the videos at Band.Video.
[01:23:50.207 --> 01:23:54.066]   Well, we should praise God and be thankful the globalists are being
[01:23:54.066 --> 01:23:57.126]   exposed and are in deep trouble. Now we haven't won the war against their
[01:23:57.126 --> 01:24:01.847]   tyranny but at least we're fighting back. We're in the game and the game ain't over
[01:24:01.847 --> 01:24:06.086]  yet so thank your lucky stars and say a prayer.
[01:24:04.606 --> 01:24:05.930]  And say another one and say another one.
[01:24:06.670 --> 01:24:10.531]  Alright, I've known Larry Pinckney for 20 years, or longer he's been coming on the show.
[01:24:11.012 --> 01:24:21.415]  Great author, great researcher, a real civil rights activist, original founding member of the Black Panther Party, not the new Fed-run one, because they don't just take over the liberal groups, they take over the conservative groups.
[01:24:21.815 --> 01:24:27.097]  It came out this week, federal documents, FBI running the white supremacist groups, as if you can't look at them and tell.
[01:24:27.737 --> 01:24:31.539]  They're doing it to create division and get us to fight with each other, and that even came out in the documents.
[01:24:32.119 --> 01:24:33.740]  But Larry, I'm not sure what you called in about.
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:34.800]  I've been trying to get you on for months.
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:35.720]  I know you're a busy man.
[01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:45.483]  But I'm guessing you might have been listening last hour when I was breaking down what's happened to American workers and all the illegal aliens.
[01:24:45.663 --> 01:24:46.583]  I'm trying to speculate.
[01:24:46.603 --> 01:24:47.724]  I guess we'll find out right now.
[01:24:48.144 --> 01:24:49.264]  Larry, great to have you on with us.
[01:24:50.544 --> 01:24:58.907]  Well, my good brother, first of all, I just want to say to you, definitely, personally and publicly, I love you, bro.
[01:24:59.631 --> 01:25:06.397]  You are the Paul Revere and Crispus Attucks of our Republic, and I said Republic.
[01:25:06.978 --> 01:25:16.326]  You have fought the good fight and are continuing to do so, along with the loyal Patriot listeners, all right?
[01:25:16.667 --> 01:25:18.709]  Supporters of Infowars.
[01:25:19.269 --> 01:25:25.506]   This is a struggle not merely Not merely for InfoWars, as you've emphasized.
[01:25:25.526 --> 01:25:31.752]  It is a struggle for this entire republic, and indeed for this entire globe.
[01:25:32.112 --> 01:25:33.654]  So, you know what?
[01:25:33.974 --> 01:25:35.936]  Yes, I've been- Well Larry, I love you too.
[01:25:35.956 --> 01:25:37.318]  I love you as a co-host.
[01:25:37.338 --> 01:25:38.379]  If you do it, you're always busy.
[01:25:38.859 --> 01:25:40.001]  So, God bless you.
[01:25:40.021 --> 01:25:41.822]  You've got the floor for the next 5-10 minutes.
[01:25:41.842 --> 01:25:42.083]  Go ahead.
[01:25:43.365 --> 01:25:59.434]  All right, well, first of all, I want to point out and remind the listeners, because it's no doubt to me that InfoWars listeners are the most intelligent, well-informed, conscious listeners on the waves today.
[01:25:59.754 --> 01:26:19.281]   Now, I want to remind us, including myself, That what is going on with the so-called Democratic, and they're not Democratic, they're very undemocratic, but what's going on with the Democrats is a continuation of what they did back in the 1800s.
[01:26:19.561 --> 01:26:20.862]  Come on, let's remember.
[01:26:21.482 --> 01:26:27.245]  You said correctly that they were the ones who were pushing slavery.
[01:26:27.405 --> 01:26:28.586]  Yes, they were.
[01:26:29.358 --> 01:26:32.601]  They were the ones who were pushing the Ku Klux Klan.
[01:26:32.882 --> 01:26:34.183]  Yes, they were.
[01:26:34.503 --> 01:26:44.774]  But you see what they've done in the past 40 to 50 years is they've insidiously tried to flip the script, as it were.
[01:26:46.713 --> 01:26:57.663]  Fortunately, fortunately, an increasing amount of people, including, I'm proud to say, a number of black Americans.
[01:26:57.763 --> 01:27:00.785]  I said black Americans because I'm a black American.
[01:27:01.186 --> 01:27:02.827]  I'm not an African American.
[01:27:02.947 --> 01:27:04.949]  I'm a black American.
[01:27:05.029 --> 01:27:09.473]  My experience, the family that I come from, is what?
[01:27:10.203 --> 01:27:11.164]  American!
[01:27:11.784 --> 01:27:12.844]  American!
[01:27:13.445 --> 01:27:17.507]  I've been to Africa and one of the first things I learned in Africa was what?
[01:27:17.867 --> 01:27:19.228]  You are an American!
[01:27:19.508 --> 01:27:21.048]  You're damn right I am!
[01:27:21.849 --> 01:27:23.229]  And I'm proud of it.
[01:27:24.090 --> 01:27:26.031]  Not saying that we're perfect.
[01:27:26.291 --> 01:27:27.872]  Tell me one country that is.
[01:27:28.472 --> 01:27:34.455]  But I want to say that we're living in some incredibly perilous times.
[01:27:35.696 --> 01:27:46.825]   The Democrats The Deep State Democrats are in disarray, which means we had better be damn aware, aware, okay?
[01:27:47.025 --> 01:27:56.774]  They will do anything, my brothers and sisters, to be white, black, brown, red, yellow citizens, and I repeat, citizens of this country.
[01:27:57.495 --> 01:27:58.856]  They've committed fraud.
[01:27:59.725 --> 01:28:22.652]  Alright, in the previous so-called election, okay, to steal the election, and you bet your bottom dollar, as my father used to say, my father who was a United States military combat veteran in Korea, but as my father used to say, you can bet your bottom dollar that they, who's the they?
[01:28:23.332 --> 01:28:29.222]   The neoliberal fascist Lying, hypocritical Democrats.
[01:28:29.422 --> 01:28:33.304]  They intend to steal the election today.
[01:28:33.644 --> 01:28:47.231]  So while we should be, shall I say, very interested in what is happening within the civil war that's going on within the Democrat Party, let's be careful!
[01:28:47.916 --> 01:29:05.314]  Let's pay close attention and let's, I'm going to say this, let's intensify our struggle because these demonic pieces of scum have no boundary, personally, politically, etc.
[01:29:05.434 --> 01:29:06.515]  Larry, that's my concern.
[01:29:06.535 --> 01:29:07.055]  I agree with you.
[01:29:07.095 --> 01:29:07.956]  They're a cornered animal.
[01:29:07.976 --> 01:29:08.617]  They're going to do anything.
[01:29:09.975 --> 01:29:12.496]  That's right, and we'd better be aware.
[01:29:12.576 --> 01:29:15.898]  Now, I'm not saying that we need to cower.
[01:29:16.138 --> 01:29:18.299]  In fact, I'm saying just the opposite.
[01:29:19.779 --> 01:29:30.764]  To intensify, intensify into those neoliberal fascist Democrats and their rhino Republican surrogates, I say this.
[01:29:31.185 --> 01:29:32.225]  We've got your number.
[01:29:32.625 --> 01:29:33.686]  We know who you are.
[01:29:34.046 --> 01:29:35.186]  We know what you're about.
[01:29:35.507 --> 01:29:41.867]   And you, Alex, You have been a major target of COINTELPRO.
[01:29:42.287 --> 01:29:45.009]  C-O-I-N-T-E-L-P-R-O.
[01:29:45.069 --> 01:29:46.869]  The Counterintelligence Program.
[01:29:47.069 --> 01:29:49.771]  And you said that years ago, but they now admit it in court.
[01:29:49.811 --> 01:29:51.371]  The FBI, the CIA came after me.
[01:29:52.052 --> 01:29:52.692]  They came after you.
[01:29:52.712 --> 01:29:53.592]  They put you in prison.
[01:29:54.673 --> 01:29:55.173]  That's right.
[01:29:55.473 --> 01:30:00.735]  And, let's be blunt, they're coming after President Trump and have been for years.
[01:30:01.376 --> 01:30:02.656]  That's what they do.
[01:30:03.216 --> 01:30:05.930]   And they talk about Democracy?
[01:30:06.191 --> 01:30:07.092]  What a joke!
[01:30:07.152 --> 01:30:09.152]  We have no democracy.
[01:30:09.152 --> 01:30:12.152]   So what should we do? Give us your real assessment of Trump and what we can do.
[01:30:12.152 --> 01:30:16.152]   Because he does care about the people. He's tough, but he's not invincible.
[01:30:16.152 --> 01:30:21.152]   People need to know that he comes off as really strong, which he is, but he's in a lot of danger.
[01:30:21.152 --> 01:30:23.152]  Just like JFK or Martin Luther King.
[01:30:23.152 --> 01:30:24.152]  Exactly.
[01:30:24.552 --> 01:30:25.733]  You just said it.
[01:30:26.093 --> 01:30:29.254]  Just like JFK, Martin Luther King, even Malcolm.
[01:30:29.574 --> 01:30:41.537]  The bottom line is that these people would not hesitate, not for a New York minute, they would not hesitate to assassinate Trump.
[01:30:42.197 --> 01:30:47.939]  They would not hesitate to assassinate Biden and put it on Trump supporters.
[01:30:47.999 --> 01:30:49.079]  They would not.
[01:30:49.159 --> 01:30:54.485]   We are dealing with demonic Dangerous, insidious creatures.
[01:30:55.046 --> 01:30:59.908]  You know, Biden said, quote, you ain't black if you don't vote for me.
[01:30:59.928 --> 01:31:00.869]  All right.
[01:31:00.909 --> 01:31:03.730]  Hillary Clinton said you're deplorable.
[01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:05.591]  You know, you didn't vote for her.
[01:31:06.391 --> 01:31:07.592]  I mean, I'm a U.S.
[01:31:07.632 --> 01:31:10.574]  citizen, and millions and millions of other U.S.
[01:31:10.634 --> 01:31:12.935]  citizens, including white U.S.
[01:31:12.995 --> 01:31:20.660]  citizens, how dare you say something that no doubt Adolf Hitler would have said to the German people?
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:24.382]  You ain't German if you don't support the Third Reich.
[01:31:24.922 --> 01:31:25.242]  What?
[01:31:25.903 --> 01:31:33.792]   This should never have been tolerated by anyone, and as far as Biden's so-called finality.
[01:31:34.233 --> 01:31:37.520]  Biden has always been evil.
[01:31:38.386 --> 01:31:44.671]  Okay, he's not as proficient at hiding his evilness as he used to be.
[01:31:45.092 --> 01:31:49.015]  But the Democrat Party, the DNC, they've known this.
[01:31:49.415 --> 01:31:51.537]  They've known about his finality.
[01:31:51.597 --> 01:31:55.940]  They've known about... Understand what the game is.
[01:31:55.980 --> 01:32:05.568]  Well, remember Judge Joe Brown in the late 60s was already a black lawyer and he's in a meeting with Joe Biden literally running down black people.
[01:32:06.781 --> 01:32:07.021]  Mm-hmm.
[01:32:08.122 --> 01:32:08.742]  Openly!
[01:32:09.322 --> 01:32:09.922]  Openly!
[01:32:10.542 --> 01:32:19.886]  But somehow this all gets buried, and blacks are supposed to believe, oh, he's great, he's our slave master.
[01:32:20.406 --> 01:32:26.188]  I think that increasingly black people of all ages are saying, wait a damn minute, we've had enough.
[01:32:26.388 --> 01:32:27.369]  Well, that was my next question.
[01:32:27.409 --> 01:32:29.429]  How panicked are they in the focus groups?
[01:32:29.509 --> 01:32:32.230]  Up to half of black Americans are going to vote Trump.
[01:32:32.490 --> 01:32:33.751]  What does that tell the establishment?
[01:32:34.801 --> 01:32:44.385]  It tells the establishment that they're in trouble, which is one of the reasons that they are bringing in all of these illegal migrants or whatever one wants to call them.
[01:32:44.425 --> 01:32:45.805]  They're here illegally.
[01:32:46.625 --> 01:32:47.966]  They're here illegally.
[01:32:48.286 --> 01:32:53.708]  My father and my uncle, alright, my dad who was in a Korean War, U.S.
[01:32:53.888 --> 01:33:01.551]  Army, my uncle, my dad's older brother who was in World War II and D-Day invasion, they didn't fight for this!
[01:33:02.171 --> 01:33:11.536]  That's not what they were fighting for, to have these people, quote-unquote, coming in to take everything that we've struggled.
[01:33:12.196 --> 01:33:18.979]  I have problems, of course, with our government, no matter what so-called party is in.
[01:33:19.319 --> 01:33:22.661]  But the Democrats, oh my God!
[01:33:23.405 --> 01:33:37.111]  We cannot, we must not, allow these hypocrites, these liars, to... Well Larry, I said this this morning in a tweet, in a post, I said, the Democratic Party must steal elections or they're over.
[01:33:37.771 --> 01:33:44.233]  I think we're seeing the end of the Democratic Party, I think we'll see a new party come forward, but you're right, that's why they're so dangerous.
[01:33:44.253 --> 01:33:45.474]  They realize they're at the end.
[01:33:46.744 --> 01:33:47.164]  They do!
[01:33:47.485 --> 01:33:48.866]  Of course they do, my brother!
[01:33:49.206 --> 01:33:50.067]  Of course they do!
[01:33:50.387 --> 01:33:53.550]  That's why, as you said, they're like a cornered animal.
[01:33:53.950 --> 01:33:54.511]  Watch out!
[01:33:55.111 --> 01:34:01.657]  They will use every deception, every insidious action that they possibly can.
[01:34:01.937 --> 01:34:03.879]  But you know what we have on our side?
[01:34:04.219 --> 01:34:06.141]  First and foremost, we have God.
[01:34:06.701 --> 01:34:08.423]  Secondly, we have the truth.
[01:34:09.088 --> 01:34:13.992]  Thirdly, we have the fact that we are not giving up.
[01:34:14.172 --> 01:34:15.733]  We're going to intensify.
[01:34:15.793 --> 01:34:16.113]  I agree.
[01:34:16.133 --> 01:34:17.234]  So let me ask you this.
[01:34:17.294 --> 01:34:21.077]  If I talk to Trump, let's say in the next few days, which I will be probably, let's leave it at that.
[01:34:21.677 --> 01:34:24.539]  What should, your advice, what do you think Trump should do right now?
[01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:34.627]  I think that President Trump should stay the course as far as pushing to be our next president.
[01:34:34.707 --> 01:34:42.210]   However, I think He needs to be very watchful about the rhinos.
[01:34:42.270 --> 01:34:47.092]  I think he needs to surround himself with people who are not rhinos.
[01:34:47.172 --> 01:34:48.333]  Rhino Republicans.
[01:34:48.373 --> 01:34:49.833]  Republican in name only.
[01:34:50.154 --> 01:34:52.875]  This is deeper than the Republican Party.
[01:34:53.155 --> 01:34:55.516]  This is about the very survival.
[01:34:56.316 --> 01:35:00.058]  Of our country, of our nation, of our republic.
[01:35:00.298 --> 01:35:03.320]  And we're not just talking people say, oh, you're racist.
[01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:08.742]  You don't want brown people or black people that come in.
[01:35:08.782 --> 01:35:09.983]  That's absurd.
[01:35:10.603 --> 01:35:11.404]  I am black.
[01:35:11.904 --> 01:35:16.786]  I come from a family that's both black and indigenous native, so-called Indian.
[01:35:17.106 --> 01:35:18.107]  No, I won't.
[01:35:18.447 --> 01:35:25.126]   Our republic have sovereignty and I would urge the president to use that
[01:35:25.126 --> 01:35:30.646]  word more and more increasingly. This is about sovereignty.
[01:35:30.646 --> 01:35:35.966]   Exactly, it's not that America's perfect, we're horrible, done bad, we love, at the end of the day we're a people.
[01:35:35.966 --> 01:35:40.126]   The globalists are coming in with the central banks with a whole new system
[01:35:40.126 --> 01:35:43.286]  where we have no rights.
[01:35:41.774 --> 01:35:48.702]  So we can bitch about the old system all day long that we're part of, or we can just roll over and let a whole new technocracy take over.
[01:35:49.796 --> 01:35:50.376]  Exactly.
[01:35:50.617 --> 01:35:54.079]  And what we have to do is to be creative.
[01:35:54.399 --> 01:35:56.000]  We're not going to roll over.
[01:35:56.300 --> 01:36:01.883]  We're not going to let the technocrats or the Silicon Valley or the big corporations.
[01:36:01.923 --> 01:36:02.984]  We're not going to go there.
[01:36:03.384 --> 01:36:11.549]  This is about, as we used to say back in the real original Black Panther Party, this is about all power to the people.
[01:36:11.809 --> 01:36:19.314]   Everyday, ordinary black, white, brown, red and yellow people of this country, America, America's not perfect.
[01:36:19.414 --> 01:36:20.335]  It has flaws.
[01:36:20.636 --> 01:36:24.419]  But as I said before, every country has its flaws.
[01:36:24.579 --> 01:36:38.452]  And I say again to you, my brother, I say again to you, and I mean this, I miss you, I watch you all the time, but I really miss you, and I hope I'll be able to see you soon and give you the big hug that you deserve.
[01:36:38.952 --> 01:36:41.334]  We love you, Larry Pinckney, and I've been trying to get you on for months.
[01:36:41.374 --> 01:36:42.355]  Come on, anytime you can.
[01:36:42.375 --> 01:36:48.279]  Even if it's not during the live show, we'll tape it, we'll have it here, but in closing, what is your advice to all Americans in closing?
[01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:52.102]  My advice is unify.
[01:36:52.822 --> 01:36:53.443]  Unify.
[01:36:53.783 --> 01:37:11.462]   Do not be disunited by the insidious disinformation that, you know, so-called news, because it's not news, but so-called news media such as CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, etc.
[01:37:12.143 --> 01:37:13.243]  are putting across.
[01:37:13.724 --> 01:37:15.945]  You know, don't be misled.
[01:37:16.285 --> 01:37:18.366]  They're not going to encourage you.
[01:37:18.386 --> 01:37:23.708]  They're going to try and disinform you and disunite us.
[01:37:23.808 --> 01:37:33.216]   So my humble, respectful message to the American people God bless America and fight hard for it.
[01:37:33.416 --> 01:37:35.517]  We must get our republic back.
[01:37:35.857 --> 01:37:38.278]  Don't give a damn what your color is.
[01:37:38.639 --> 01:37:41.060]  Larry, you're an amazing speaker and you're hard to get on the show.
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:41.940]  We appreciate you calling in.
[01:37:42.079 --> 01:37:49.079]  How do people find you?
[01:37:49.363 --> 01:37:50.844]  Yeah, Larry, how do we find you?
[01:37:51.244 --> 01:37:52.865]  How do people that want to get you on or talk to you?
[01:37:52.885 --> 01:37:53.745]  Where do we find you, Larry?
[01:37:54.833 --> 01:38:02.298]  Just go to Black Activist, that's all one word, Black Activist, okay?
[01:38:02.999 --> 01:38:06.841]  WG, which stands for Writers Guild, dot org.
[01:38:07.222 --> 01:38:10.164]  Black Activist, WG, dot org.
[01:38:10.244 --> 01:38:15.567]  We'd love to hear from you, from the audience, and I love the audience.
[01:38:15.767 --> 01:38:18.329]  They are incredible, and I love you.
[01:38:18.689 --> 01:38:20.591]  So, that's how you can reach me.
[01:38:20.991 --> 01:38:22.192]  I'm doing what I can do.
[01:38:22.312 --> 01:38:23.693]  I'm fighting the good fight.
[01:38:24.233 --> 01:38:27.234]  I'm a little bit older than you, Alex, but you know what?
[01:38:27.354 --> 01:38:32.777]  As we say, la cima tu scende en velechaca, which means the struggle continues.
[01:38:33.277 --> 01:38:33.917]  And it will.
[01:38:34.338 --> 01:38:45.963]  And ultimately, if we fight, if we struggle, and I'm talking about nonviolent, so nobody will misinterpret it, if we struggle, we will win.
[01:38:46.303 --> 01:38:47.703]  Well, in closing, let me just bring that up.
[01:38:47.723 --> 01:38:49.504]  I don't know if you saw the documents I mentioned earlier.
[01:38:49.564 --> 01:38:50.545]  I should have covered it earlier today.
[01:38:51.764 --> 01:38:55.167]  All the documents just came out in court that the feds are running all the white supremacy groups.
[01:38:55.667 --> 01:38:57.669]  We already knew that, but that is so disgusting.
[01:38:59.290 --> 01:39:00.391]  That's what they do!
[01:39:01.031 --> 01:39:04.234]  I mean, that's what, how else can they control the narrative?
[01:39:04.634 --> 01:39:05.635]  They have to do that.
[01:39:05.675 --> 01:39:10.699]  This is nothing new, this is why I go back, it's only becoming very obvious today.
[01:39:10.759 --> 01:39:13.381]  Hell, they were doing that in the 60s and 70s!
[01:39:13.921 --> 01:39:21.913]   Not just for so-called white supremacist groups, but across the board, because it's all about divide, Disinformed.
[01:39:22.633 --> 01:39:23.193]  Disinformed.
[01:39:23.233 --> 01:39:25.975]  Exactly, like Black Lives Matter is openly run by Soros.
[01:39:27.075 --> 01:39:30.877]  Well, Black Lives Matter, they are a thick joke.
[01:39:31.578 --> 01:39:33.178]  A thick joke.
[01:39:33.539 --> 01:39:36.340]  They don't give a damn about black people.
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:42.283]  That's why their leadership, or former leadership, lives in these multi-million dollar homes.
[01:39:43.487 --> 01:40:04.076]   Nothing's changed for black folk and I would urge black folk in particular to come on now brookers don't ancestors don't be hoodwink don't be bamboozled stop it wake up our president and that's when I say our president I'm talking about Mr. Trump It's not perfect.
[01:40:04.416 --> 01:40:05.157]  Neither are you.
[01:40:05.477 --> 01:40:06.338]  Neither are we.
[01:40:06.818 --> 01:40:08.499]  But we know we have the choice.
[01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:16.206]  And the choice is between saving our republic, regaining our republic, or losing everything.
[01:40:16.306 --> 01:40:17.847]  So let me ask you this in closing.
[01:40:18.668 --> 01:40:21.230]  Why do they give us your honest assessment of Trump?
[01:40:21.250 --> 01:40:22.591]  Because I think he just wants prosperity.
[01:40:22.611 --> 01:40:24.332]  His companies are about...
[01:40:28.527 --> 01:40:31.169]  Well, I think that what makes Trump tick is that he has this, how can I describe it?
[01:40:31.229 --> 01:40:32.711]  He's got the warrior mentality.
[01:40:33.311 --> 01:40:33.832]  He won't quit.
[01:40:33.652 --> 01:40:36.692]   What do you think really makes Trump tick and then why do you think they hate him, they
[01:40:36.692 --> 01:40:37.692]  really hate him?
[01:40:37.692 --> 01:40:46.532]   Well, I think that what makes Trump tick is that he has this, how can I describe it?
[01:40:46.532 --> 01:40:49.490]  He's got the warrior mentality.
[01:40:49.490 --> 01:40:50.931]  He won't quit.
[01:40:50.931 --> 01:40:53.331]  He won't back down.
[01:40:53.331 --> 01:40:57.091]  And he said, "Okay, you pour this on me, I will respond."
[01:40:57.679 --> 01:40:59.720]  Not just react, but respond.
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:01.360]  It's the big difference between the two.
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:03.481]  Now, why do they hate him?
[01:41:03.901 --> 01:41:10.543]  They hate him because even by, and he's not perfect, by any means, but damn it, he's the best we have.
[01:41:10.743 --> 01:41:15.284]  The best this country has had in many, many decades, if not more.
[01:41:15.704 --> 01:41:17.945]  So why did, that's why they hate him.
[01:41:18.565 --> 01:41:23.428]  That people said, oh well Trump made this remark, or Trump made that remark.
[01:41:23.448 --> 01:41:25.289]  I'm saying, don't you get it dude?
[01:41:25.829 --> 01:41:27.129]  That's why we love him!
[01:41:28.010 --> 01:41:30.931]  Because he says what he means.
[01:41:31.192 --> 01:41:36.654]  He doesn't have to wrap it in eloquent, sophisticated, nonsensical BS.
[01:41:36.674 --> 01:41:40.236]  Well that's why you make all these deals, because they know when Trump says something, he means it.
[01:41:41.157 --> 01:41:41.657]  That's right.
[01:41:42.217 --> 01:41:42.697]  That's right.
[01:41:43.418 --> 01:41:45.519]  And that is why they hate him.
[01:41:46.115 --> 01:42:00.600]  They are scared to death of him, and more importantly, or just as importantly, they are scared to death of the everyday, ordinary black, white, brown, red, and yellow citizens of this country who support him.
[01:42:01.101 --> 01:42:04.282]  That's who ultimately... They hate our unity.
[01:42:04.342 --> 01:42:05.142]  That's who they want.
[01:42:05.182 --> 01:42:06.002]  They hate our unity.
[01:42:07.163 --> 01:42:12.025]  They hate it, but that tells us we need to intensify our unity.
[01:42:12.065 --> 01:42:20.109]   We have our differences, but as Brother Malcolm X said, Keep your differences in the closet, but you come out united.
[01:42:20.529 --> 01:42:21.350]  United.
[01:42:21.690 --> 01:42:26.153]  And I pray, I pray that that's what we will continue to do.
[01:42:27.613 --> 01:42:28.694]  Larry, powerful brother.
[01:42:28.754 --> 01:42:30.175]  You tell me when you want to come on.
[01:42:30.595 --> 01:42:31.215]  You're on the show.
[01:42:31.255 --> 01:42:31.656]  We love you.
[01:42:32.796 --> 01:42:34.057]  Hope I see you next week.
[01:42:34.097 --> 01:42:35.478]  That's what I'm looking forward to.
[01:42:35.838 --> 01:42:37.099]  I love you too, my brother.
[01:42:37.119 --> 01:42:37.919]  Stay strong.
[01:42:38.119 --> 01:42:40.320]  You are all that and then some.
[01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:41.301]  Stay strong, brother.
[01:42:41.601 --> 01:42:42.161]  I'm trying, Larry.
[01:42:42.502 --> 01:42:43.602]  God, I love Larry's voice.
[01:42:43.622 --> 01:42:44.583]  I love that guy.
[01:42:45.461 --> 01:42:45.821]  I love him.
[01:42:46.542 --> 01:42:46.842]  I love him.
[01:42:47.843 --> 01:42:55.368]  And, uh, so despite them trying to get us to fight with each other, and there's a reason to all hate each other, kill each other, I just, I like Larry Pinckney.
[01:42:55.388 --> 01:42:57.389]  I love him a lot, so I can't, you know, I just get it.
[01:42:59.211 --> 01:43:00.672]  By the way, I got something big cooking.
[01:43:02.693 --> 01:43:05.295]  And, uh, we got a lot of stuff cooking, actually.
[01:43:06.482 --> 01:43:09.606]  But I got some big stuff going on right now.
[01:43:11.108 --> 01:43:15.093]  And, uh, you know, I never tell listeners I got something big going on.
[01:43:15.133 --> 01:43:15.914]  I've got it going on.
[01:43:16.575 --> 01:43:16.856]  I got.
[01:43:18.752 --> 01:43:21.153]  I got four things going big right now.
[01:43:21.353 --> 01:43:22.634]  Big, big enchiladas.
[01:43:23.335 --> 01:43:28.458]  And I love being on air, and I love all this stuff, but I'm pissed off because these things are so big.
[01:43:28.998 --> 01:43:31.159]  If I spent all day on those, they'd be even bigger.
[01:43:31.619 --> 01:43:32.540]  That's my frustration.
[01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:46.508]  Like, it's kind of a Hobson's choice, because if I spent all day on the phone with world leaders and other big influencers, and I mean the biggest, the biggest, I'd probably have a bigger effect.
[01:43:47.423 --> 01:43:53.888]  I can do stuff on the telephone with a major talk show host that's bigger than what I do on this show.
[01:43:56.049 --> 01:43:59.552]  And so, I'm very close to quitting.
[01:44:00.672 --> 01:44:08.138]  Not because I'm quitting, but if I just disappear and no one sees Alex Jones, I'm telling you my own mind right now.
[01:44:10.479 --> 01:44:13.662]  But I love the crew, they get let go, so I'm sentimental.
[01:44:14.974 --> 01:44:25.037]  But if I just disappeared right now, I would have 10 times the gravitas with the big talk show host and the leaders.
[01:44:28.758 --> 01:44:30.179]  But then there's the other part of it.
[01:44:31.359 --> 01:44:35.520]  I wouldn't have any money to even pay my bills, and I'm down to nothing, which I don't care about.
[01:44:36.221 --> 01:44:38.401]  But it's a paradox.
[01:44:39.382 --> 01:44:57.586]   I gotta stay on air to keep the crew employed, make money to live, pay my electricity bill, But at the same time, if I disappear, it'll be even bigger, and then I can make the phone calls and see it happen on air anyways.
[01:44:59.007 --> 01:45:01.207]  And that's what I want my enemies to know, is you've already lost.
[01:45:02.627 --> 01:45:07.608]  Maybe you can blow the planet up, maybe you can have World War III, maybe you do that, but you have done nothing.
[01:45:08.609 --> 01:45:09.149]  You failed.
[01:45:09.829 --> 01:45:21.083]   And it's not about... See, my enemies aren't important enough For me to sit here and sacrifice anything for them.
[01:45:22.004 --> 01:45:22.864]  Because they don't matter.
[01:45:24.444 --> 01:45:27.545]  My real job is inspiring you.
[01:45:29.226 --> 01:45:36.127]  My real job is getting you to realize whether you're black or white or hispanic or asian or old or young or whatever.
[01:45:36.988 --> 01:45:37.868]  That's my real mission.
[01:45:39.498 --> 01:45:43.821]  And so that's why I see all the infighting and people dunking on each other and stuff.
[01:45:43.881 --> 01:45:45.022]  It doesn't matter, folks.
[01:45:45.622 --> 01:45:47.924]  We're trying to stop World War III.
[01:45:49.765 --> 01:45:54.108]  And I challenge anybody that's racist.
[01:45:54.489 --> 01:45:54.949]  And I get it.
[01:45:54.969 --> 01:45:55.970]  Your attack is you're black.
[01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.930]  Your attack is you're white.
[01:45:57.411 --> 01:45:58.432]  Your attack is you're Jewish.
[01:45:58.472 --> 01:45:59.552]  Your attack is you're Muslim.
[01:45:59.572 --> 01:46:01.113]  You know, it's fun to get in that group.
[01:46:01.594 --> 01:46:03.475]  And it all makes sense at a certain level.
[01:46:04.216 --> 01:46:06.537]  But it's being manipulated.
[01:46:07.818 --> 01:46:08.799]  It's being controlled.
[01:46:10.996 --> 01:46:15.600]  And so I'm just sitting back, believing in humanity.
[01:46:16.961 --> 01:46:32.613]  And I believe that if I just lay out the facts of what the issues are, we can skip what religion somebody is or what group they're in and just say, we oppose the World Social Credit Score.
[01:46:33.413 --> 01:46:35.655]  We oppose the vaccine mandate.
[01:46:36.235 --> 01:46:37.496]  We oppose world government.
[01:46:37.937 --> 01:46:40.579]  We oppose transgenderism for children.
[01:46:41.755 --> 01:46:44.477]  We don't hate the folks that are already in the transgender net.
[01:46:44.537 --> 01:46:45.958]  We're not attacking them.
[01:46:46.358 --> 01:46:51.602]  We're just saying we do not choose to be with you.
[01:46:53.123 --> 01:46:56.826]  We do not choose to submit to your world agenda.
[01:46:58.947 --> 01:47:02.330]  And that's really what I've tried to do is have a big tent for everybody.
[01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:05.192]  Because I like Larry Pickney.
[01:47:06.437 --> 01:47:06.977]  I love him.
[01:47:07.678 --> 01:47:11.360]  Had dinner with him 10 times, hung out with him, you know, done countless shows with him.
[01:47:11.841 --> 01:47:13.362]  I don't look at him and say, that's a black guy.
[01:47:13.942 --> 01:47:20.827]  That's a really smart, funny guy who's amazing and who is attractive to me spiritually.
[01:47:22.628 --> 01:47:23.168]  I like him.
[01:47:24.789 --> 01:47:26.531]  I like, I like him a lot.
[01:47:27.071 --> 01:47:27.811]  And he's black.
[01:47:29.533 --> 01:47:35.917]  So I'm not going to sit there when they get an army of racist black people to attack me and go, well, I'm just going to hate all the black people right now.
[01:47:37.355 --> 01:47:42.079]  I'm gonna sit back and say, what is the larger mission for humanity?
[01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:58.452]  We're on this little planet, a seed, that hasn't even sprouted yet, and there's this whole giant universe in front of us, trillions of galaxies, trillions and trillions of planets, and we're worried about what color your skin is?
[01:47:59.393 --> 01:48:06.819]  No, my friends, this is humanity's test before the next level, and we're about to go to the next level.
[01:48:07.813 --> 01:48:08.899]  Hour number four, straight ahead.
[01:48:10.981 --> 01:48:24.184]  Well, people don't know, by the way, so, you know, and I'll say this again, that many moons ago, when I was just getting started in all of this, that I remember I used to come on with Alex in 2016 is when we started doing it.
[01:48:24.504 --> 01:48:26.005]  Met you at the RNC in Cleveland.
[01:48:26.045 --> 01:48:27.625]  We did the rally by the river.
[01:48:27.645 --> 01:48:28.085]  Yeah.
[01:48:28.665 --> 01:48:29.966]  With Roger and everyone's there.
[01:48:30.526 --> 01:48:31.966]  And Diamond and Silk were there.
[01:48:32.006 --> 01:48:32.586]  That was great.
[01:48:32.606 --> 01:48:37.828]  We're out here, despite all the threats, exercising your sacred First Amendment.
[01:48:37.908 --> 01:48:38.568]  We salute you!
[01:48:39.189 --> 01:48:42.621]  InfoWars salutes you, and you are part of history.
[01:48:42.822 --> 01:48:43.705]  You are the future.
[01:48:43.645 --> 01:48:44.645]  God bless you.
[01:48:44.645 --> 01:48:46.645]  [cheers and applause]
[01:48:46.645 --> 01:48:49.645]  USA! USA!
[01:48:49.645 --> 01:48:53.645]   Back then, even before I was at One America, I used to host Hour Four.
[01:48:54.417 --> 01:48:54.917]  You remember that?
[01:48:55.097 --> 01:48:55.297]  Yeah.
[01:48:55.797 --> 01:48:58.058]  And you'd be like, I didn't even know you back then!
[01:48:58.198 --> 01:49:01.159]  And you were, I was just some guy, and you were like, hey, your microphone's not good.
[01:49:01.199 --> 01:49:14.744]  So guys, Alex Jones sends me my first microphone that I've got set up in like a, just like a spare bedroom in the house, and I'm doing it over my laptop, and he goes, oh yeah, yeah, I need someone to host Hour Four.
[01:49:14.764 --> 01:49:16.365]  So I'm like, get in there, just do it.
[01:49:16.385 --> 01:49:17.445]  He's like, what do you want me to talk about?
[01:49:17.705 --> 01:49:18.906]  As wherever you like, I gotta go.
[01:49:19.246 --> 01:49:22.208]  And I'm like, I'm just some, I'm just some guy at that point.
[01:49:22.228 --> 01:49:24.970]  You know, I had been through 2016, we had met, etc, etc.
[01:49:25.030 --> 01:49:26.111]  No, but you were a smart guy.
[01:49:26.131 --> 01:49:32.856]  But it, but it, my point though is that people don't realize how much Alex does behind the scenes to help people.
[01:49:33.136 --> 01:49:40.061]  People don't realize how much that Alex really is just, just generous with his time, generous with his resources.
[01:49:40.321 --> 01:49:43.783]  And that's a side, and, and by the way, spends time with your family.
[01:49:45.164 --> 01:49:55.047]  You know something that I've always tried to say is like there's this this media caricature of Alex Jones And I'm like that's not the guy that I've ever met.
[01:49:55.167 --> 01:49:56.168]  I've never met him.
[01:49:56.288 --> 01:49:59.469]  I've spent plenty of time with him I've never met this guy.
[01:49:59.849 --> 01:50:17.914]   He sounds crazy I don't know that I want to meet the guy that they take you out to be because that's just not you and so I I mean I just want to take the opportunity real quick to just say thank you for all the help that you gave me when I was getting started Well, thank you, Jack, but it wasn't because you were like, I was, you know, you were a talented, smart guy and making great points.
[01:50:17.934 --> 01:50:20.315]  I'm like, well, hey, you need to get on air and you need to do more.
[01:50:20.675 --> 01:50:21.395]  We're going to go to break.
[01:50:21.435 --> 01:50:22.215]  He's going to take over.
[01:50:22.235 --> 01:50:24.116]  I haven't plugged in three hours.
[01:50:24.196 --> 01:50:25.236]  If we don't do that, we'll be gone.

[01:50:41.721 --> 01:50:42.861]  He's there and he was right.

[01:51:00.488 --> 01:51:01.229]  What should I go for?
[01:51:01.289 --> 01:51:04.191]  These Seminoles are all so strong, I barely take them.
[01:51:04.211 --> 01:51:04.911]  But they'll really work well.
[01:51:04.730 --> 01:51:09.730]   Alex, when you're working hard and you've got a bunch of back-to-back flights, what's good? What should I go for?
[01:51:09.730 --> 01:51:16.951]   These Seminoles are all so strong, I rarely take them, but they'll really work well. I take them all. I haven't taken
[01:51:16.951 --> 01:51:17.730]  any today.
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:19.421]  I should have, because I was up until 2 a.m.
[01:51:19.461 --> 01:51:19.961]  last night.
[01:51:20.762 --> 01:51:22.003]  But they're all excellent.
[01:51:22.023 --> 01:51:24.005]  They're all just clones of already best-selling cars.
[01:51:24.165 --> 01:51:26.327]  I want to get some before I get back on that plane.
[01:51:26.347 --> 01:51:26.967]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:51:27.548 --> 01:51:29.409]  Okay, well, I'm going to tell you right now what you want.
[01:51:29.470 --> 01:51:31.631]  I'm going to tell you what you want right now.
[01:51:31.792 --> 01:51:32.032]  Yeah?
[01:51:32.792 --> 01:51:34.454]  You want... No, that's Rocket Rush.
[01:51:34.494 --> 01:51:35.094]  You need to sleep.
[01:51:35.234 --> 01:51:35.895]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:51:36.315 --> 01:51:37.857]  Well, I will take that later tonight.
[01:51:39.255 --> 01:51:40.476]  Next level foundational energy.
[01:51:41.056 --> 01:51:41.396]  There it is.
[01:51:41.436 --> 01:51:41.856]  Let me see.
[01:51:41.896 --> 01:51:43.217]  And there's no speed in that.
[01:51:43.477 --> 01:51:44.918]  It's a methyl folate to break down.
[01:51:44.938 --> 01:51:45.658]  Oh, wow.
[01:51:46.318 --> 01:51:46.759]  Oh, yeah.
[01:51:46.859 --> 01:51:49.940]  It's methyl folate to break down of what's in spinach.
[01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:50.941]  There's a lot in here.
[01:51:50.961 --> 01:51:53.042]  There's a ton in here.
[01:51:53.102 --> 01:51:54.322]  The point is, it's a great product.
[01:51:54.722 --> 01:51:58.284]  This isn't one of the ones where they, you know, put the cotton in on the top so you only get a little bit.
[01:51:58.304 --> 01:51:58.784]  This is full.
[01:51:58.923 --> 01:52:00.122]  You're nice to support us.
[01:52:00.122 --> 01:52:18.003]  It's all a game.
[01:52:18.230 --> 01:52:22.151]  A huge, huge, terrible, bloody game.
[01:52:22.631 --> 01:52:23.011]  Okay?
[01:52:24.292 --> 01:52:27.333]  Of course it would make white people angry.
[01:52:27.613 --> 01:52:28.273]  Of course!
[01:52:28.713 --> 01:52:29.033]  Why?
[01:52:29.314 --> 01:52:33.415]  Because the pigmentation of their skin determines their destiny?
[01:52:33.915 --> 01:52:34.915]  Excuse me?
[01:52:35.556 --> 01:52:42.134]   That is Insane on one hand, but on the other hand, it's a part of a plan!
[01:52:42.855 --> 01:52:47.019]  If you keep pounding people and pushing people, okay?
[01:52:47.299 --> 01:52:51.944]  I'm not saying that there is no racism in this country, of course!
[01:52:52.204 --> 01:52:56.489]  But it's not just in this country, and it's not just on one side!
[01:52:57.216 --> 01:53:03.120]  It is in many countries all over the world, by the way, including Communist China.
[01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:07.522]  I'm not anti-Chinese, but I am anti-tyranny.
[01:53:08.123 --> 01:53:15.947]  I am anti the propaganda that we get that passes for so-called news.
[01:53:16.468 --> 01:53:17.088]  It's not news.
[01:53:17.628 --> 01:53:18.589]  It's propaganda.
[01:53:19.129 --> 01:53:21.291]  And there's a big, big difference.
[01:53:21.551 --> 01:53:29.098]   So I think all of us need to grow the freak up Stand up and understand.
[01:53:29.438 --> 01:53:33.161]  Once we understand, there's very little they can do.
[01:53:33.421 --> 01:53:37.844]  I'll say the most effective way to control people is to what?
[01:53:38.244 --> 01:53:39.565]  Control their minds!
[01:53:40.085 --> 01:53:41.406]  Control how they think.
[01:53:41.866 --> 01:53:44.868]  Make sure that they really don't critically think.
[01:53:45.588 --> 01:53:47.590]  Make sure that they're robots.
[01:53:48.230 --> 01:53:49.311]  To be robotic.
[01:53:51.437 --> 01:53:53.158]  We can get back to normal.
[01:53:53.218 --> 01:53:53.918]  Let me inform you.
[01:53:53.757 --> 01:53:57.997]  the vaccine. We got the vaccine. We can get back the norm.
[01:53:57.997 --> 01:54:04.377]   Let me inform you. Let's all get the vaccine. It's about community immunity. I'm talking unity
[01:54:04.377 --> 01:54:10.717]   for you and me. If Doc says it's good, trust me, it's good. Now let's all get the vaccine.
[01:54:10.717 --> 01:54:18.956]   You see, this victim mentality is nothing more than a deliberate slave mentality.
[01:54:19.163 --> 01:54:20.224]  Oh, I'm a slave!
[01:54:20.905 --> 01:54:22.026]  I can't do nothing!
[01:54:22.086 --> 01:54:22.827]  I'm a slave!
[01:54:22.927 --> 01:54:24.609]  I gotta depend on Big Brother!
[01:54:24.829 --> 01:54:25.690]  That's insane!
[01:54:26.619 --> 01:54:28.080]  And it's unacceptable.
[01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:29.420]  You're not a slave.
[01:54:29.860 --> 01:54:46.866]  And as we used to say back in the day, in the original Black Panther Party, not this so-called new Black Panther nonsense, but in the original party formed in Oakland, California in 1966, we said all power to the people!
[01:54:47.166 --> 01:54:49.287]  Black, white, brown, red, yellow!
[01:54:49.747 --> 01:54:50.048]  Okay?
[01:54:50.448 --> 01:54:51.188]  Our people!
[01:54:52.908 --> 01:54:56.769]  I hear these fools on TV talking about defund the police and things like that.
[01:54:57.329 --> 01:55:00.770]  We need police reform and prison reform and things like that.
[01:55:01.211 --> 01:55:03.711]  Because you know who ain't gonna defund the cops?
[01:55:04.452 --> 01:55:07.352]  White neighborhoods and rich neighborhoods.
[01:55:07.412 --> 01:55:13.394]  So that notion they keep saying that, I'm like, wait a minute, we just gonna leave, who are black people supposed to call?
[01:55:13.434 --> 01:55:14.014]  Ghostbusters?
[01:55:14.355 --> 01:55:15.755]  And we have crime in our neighborhoods?
[01:55:16.235 --> 01:55:17.756]  We need police reform.
[01:55:18.057 --> 01:55:22.480]  Like I say, white people, especially rich white people, they're always going to have cops.
[01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:25.762]  So we need to stop that defund or abolish the cops crap.
[01:55:25.902 --> 01:55:27.884]  This country is doomed.
[01:55:27.904 --> 01:55:40.553]  It is doomed, not just because of African Americans, but because by 2040, this country is going to be minority white European.
[01:55:41.014 --> 01:55:41.354]  Hear me?
[01:55:42.115 --> 01:55:43.696]  Minority white European.
[01:55:44.733 --> 01:55:47.636]  And you guys are gonna have to start working more with Hispanics.
[01:55:48.517 --> 01:55:51.260]  Who'll make up a larger portion of the population than y'all do.
[01:55:52.120 --> 01:55:54.343]  I'm not no Black Lives Matter supporter.
[01:55:54.583 --> 01:55:55.144]  You're not?
[01:55:55.224 --> 01:55:55.964]  No.
[01:55:56.004 --> 01:55:56.245]  Why not?
[01:55:56.265 --> 01:55:57.746]  Because it's not our movement.
[01:55:58.527 --> 01:56:03.152]  This is a movement that was given to us by, you know, George Soros.
[01:56:05.086 --> 01:56:15.873]  Um, because they saw how things were going, and they didn't want to go back to the 60s, where we start having our own organic movement, that was a big problem.
[01:56:15.893 --> 01:56:20.075]  So let's give the people the movement that we can control.
[01:56:20.095 --> 01:56:24.158]  We'll provide them with leaders and all this type of stuff.
[01:56:24.178 --> 01:56:25.119]  And, um, yeah.
[01:56:25.139 --> 01:56:27.220]  That's what Black Lives Matter is.
[01:56:29.643 --> 01:56:30.223]  Are there leaders?
[01:56:30.503 --> 01:56:31.324]  Black Lives Matter?
[01:56:31.464 --> 01:56:31.644]  Who?
[01:56:32.484 --> 01:56:40.147]  These lesbian women who are trying to incorporate, you know, LG, whatever the letters are.
[01:56:40.167 --> 01:56:45.628]  Incorporate their concerns into black people's concerns.
[01:56:45.748 --> 01:56:46.749]  Go to the website, look it up.
[01:56:47.529 --> 01:56:49.990]  Google George Soros and Black Lives Matter.
[01:56:49.829 --> 01:57:09.630]  see what comes up. If by Rudyard Kipling.
[01:57:09.630 --> 01:57:12.208]  (upbeat music)
[01:57:12.913 --> 01:58:05.983]   If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you, if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for their doubting too, if you can wait and not be tired by waiting, or being lied about, don't deal in lies, or being hated, don't give way to hating, and yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise, If you can dream and not make dreams your master, if you can think and not make thoughts your aim, if you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two impostors just the same, if you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, or watch the things you gave your life to broken and stoop and build them up with worn-out tools,
[01:58:08.095 --> 01:58:56.237]   If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it on one turn of pitch and toss And booze and start again at your beginnings And never breathe a word about your loss If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone And so hold on when there is nothing in you Except the will which says to them, hold on If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, or walk with kings, nor lose the common touch, if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, if all men count with you, but a nun too much, if you can fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds worth of distance run, yours is the earth and everything that's in it.
[01:58:57.478 --> 01:59:01.540]  And, which is more, you'll be a man, my son.
[01:59:06.428 --> 01:59:07.528]  So we're told.
[01:59:09.829 --> 01:59:12.790]  If Trump's elected, he'll wage war on the deep state.
[01:59:12.830 --> 01:59:14.570]  He'll imprison his enemies.
[01:59:17.131 --> 01:59:20.712]  But for decades, people in this country have been persecuted by the deep state.
[01:59:20.872 --> 01:59:28.074]  And now President Trump and his supporters, including myself and my own co-host, have been put in prison.
[01:59:28.494 --> 01:59:31.895]  And Steve Bannon and Navarro are in prison right now.
[01:59:33.820 --> 01:59:41.703]  And they turn around as they abuse us, as they punch us in the face, slap us upside the head, stab us in our guts.
[01:59:42.443 --> 01:59:45.444]  They say, you're gonna do this to me while they do it.
[01:59:45.544 --> 01:59:46.885]  That's gaslighting.
[01:59:50.826 --> 01:59:54.087]  Well, nobody is more famous in this persecution than Doug Mackey.
[01:59:55.408 --> 02:00:00.688]  He put out overhead shot this joke meme in 2016.
[02:00:00.688 --> 02:00:10.528]  Avoid the line, vote from home, text Hillary to 59925.
[02:00:10.814 --> 02:00:11.194]  A joke.
[02:00:11.414 --> 02:00:13.215]  Vote for Hillary and be part of history.
[02:00:15.517 --> 02:00:18.919]  And because of that joke, they put him in federal prison.
[02:00:23.783 --> 02:00:34.998]   So now to speak for himself, Douglas Mackey, meme trial, Was a trial run for Biden regime's lawfare, and here's the proof.
[02:00:35.559 --> 02:00:37.180]  Excellent article breaking that down.
[02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:38.681]  Here's another one.
[02:00:39.121 --> 02:00:42.903]  Most important First Amendment case you've ever, never heard of.
[02:00:43.083 --> 02:00:48.006]  Biden regime tries to toss a young man in prison for 10 years for anti-Hillary memes.
[02:00:49.307 --> 02:00:51.208]  A political prosecution of Douglas Mackey.
[02:00:53.829 --> 02:00:55.630]  He's going to prison for Twitter trolling.
[02:00:55.690 --> 02:00:56.791]  That's not justice.
[02:00:58.852 --> 02:01:00.053]  The Ricky Von Witch Hunt.
[02:01:01.664 --> 02:01:07.646]  Insane, Senate Dems blasted for aiding women, adding women to the draft.
[02:01:08.967 --> 02:01:15.149]  Social media influencer Douglas Mackey sentenced after conviction for election interference, 2016 presidential election.
[02:01:15.509 --> 02:01:17.049]  They're the ones openly interfering.
[02:01:18.050 --> 02:01:27.633]  All right, so Douglas Mackey joins us at the 11th hour right now, witnessing all of this and watching Trump's incredible persecution to give us his take.
[02:01:28.033 --> 02:01:29.674]  Douglas Mackey, thank you so much for being with us.
[02:01:31.164 --> 02:01:32.045]  Alex, thanks for having me.
[02:01:32.445 --> 02:01:32.886]  It's an honor.
[02:01:33.827 --> 02:01:35.949]  Well, you're the person that's experienced it.
[02:01:36.009 --> 02:01:37.411]  You've been the one run over by the truck.
[02:01:37.431 --> 02:01:38.652]  You've tasted the tires.
[02:01:39.032 --> 02:01:39.653]  You're the expert.
[02:01:39.673 --> 02:01:40.274]  Where do you want to start?
[02:01:41.795 --> 02:01:44.576]  Well, let's start with Joe Biden's inauguration.
[02:01:44.876 --> 02:01:51.538]  Two days after the inauguration, the DOJ secured a warrant for my arrest.
[02:01:51.618 --> 02:02:03.022]  Seven days after the inauguration, they knocked on my door, 7 a.m., 10, you know, four FBI agents, a handful of local law enforcement, and said, we have a warrant for your arrest.
[02:02:03.062 --> 02:02:04.843]  The first words out of my mouth were, for what?
[02:02:05.523 --> 02:02:10.065]  So if we're talking about weaponization, I think my case was the canary in the coal mine.
[02:02:12.988 --> 02:02:14.488]  And brother, absolutely.
[02:02:14.508 --> 02:02:18.349]  You're the most famous, other than Trump, law firm victim.
[02:02:18.369 --> 02:02:19.890]  So just lay it out for people.
[02:02:19.910 --> 02:02:20.650]  They need to know about this.
[02:02:21.930 --> 02:02:22.330]  Exactly.
[02:02:22.350 --> 02:02:25.691]  So this goes all the way back to the 2016 election.
[02:02:26.231 --> 02:02:29.072]  And the joke meme that I didn't even create, right?
[02:02:29.172 --> 02:02:33.253]  I found a meme on 4chan.
[02:02:33.873 --> 02:02:35.733]  And here it is for people to see it.
[02:02:35.753 --> 02:02:36.733]  Here is the great evil.
[02:02:36.793 --> 02:02:37.193]  Here it is.
[02:02:38.594 --> 02:02:39.074]  Exactly.
[02:02:39.274 --> 02:02:39.634]  Exactly.
[02:02:40.704 --> 02:02:46.131]  Obviously, you look at this on his face, it's absurd, it's ridiculous, nobody could take this seriously.
[02:02:47.052 --> 02:02:52.358]  And yet, five years later, when Joe Biden was inaugurated, I was indicted.
[02:02:52.378 --> 02:02:59.507]  They took me to the federal courthouse and I had no idea what I was being indicted for until they gave me the criminal complaint.
[02:03:00.407 --> 02:03:02.948]  And it was just the most Kafkaesque thing you ever heard of.
[02:03:03.068 --> 02:03:08.309]  And it's just been now going on a four-year journey for vindication.
[02:03:08.369 --> 02:03:10.069]  Right now, my case is up on appeal.
[02:03:10.229 --> 02:03:17.430]  I was actually convicted of conspiracy against rights for sharing this meme, which is a 10-year federal felony statute.
[02:03:18.331 --> 02:03:21.051]  So we're appealing this case, needless to say.
[02:03:21.291 --> 02:03:25.292]  And right now, we're just waiting on the appeals court to come down with a decision.
[02:03:29.135 --> 02:03:31.757]  Just describe what the process has been like for you.
[02:03:33.658 --> 02:03:34.699]  Yeah, it's unbelievable.
[02:03:34.779 --> 02:03:37.781]  First of all, they didn't secure an indictment.
[02:03:37.861 --> 02:03:39.282]  They went and got a criminal complaint.
[02:03:39.822 --> 02:03:40.403]  Why is that?
[02:03:41.345 --> 02:03:49.274]  Well, that's because if they indict you, and you're not like a violent criminal or a threat to flee or whatever, they could just issue a summons for your arrest.
[02:03:49.374 --> 02:03:54.099]  And then you just go to the courthouse, you go to your arraignment, it's a civilized procedure.
[02:03:54.158 --> 02:03:59.837]   But when they write a criminal complaint, that means that they're gonna go drag you out of your house,
[02:03:59.837 --> 02:04:04.298]   which is exactly what they did to me, and dump me on the streets of West Palm Beach after.
[02:04:04.298 --> 02:04:05.837]  They said, "You won't need your wallet.
[02:04:05.837 --> 02:04:07.638]  "You won't need your cell phone.
[02:04:07.638 --> 02:04:11.158]  "That's just going to waste your time, right?
[02:04:11.158 --> 02:04:13.377]  "'Cause you have to put it in a locker and then get it out."
[02:04:13.377 --> 02:04:15.238]   What they don't tell you is that they're just gonna dump you
[02:04:15.238 --> 02:04:19.238]   on the streets and you gotta find a way to get home with no wallet, no cell phone.
[02:04:19.238 --> 02:04:23.078]  So not only that, but it was just an unbelievable thing.
[02:04:23.078 --> 02:04:31.358]   They subpoenaed basically my whole entire life, all my email accounts, all of my bank accounts,
[02:04:31.358 --> 02:04:33.719]  all my pay stubs going back years.
[02:04:34.085 --> 02:04:45.407]  I guess they wanted to see if I was being funded by Putin or something ridiculous, which just goes to show sort of the lengths that they will go to chase down these conspiracy theories that they cook up.
[02:04:47.768 --> 02:04:53.909]  Well, again, brother, you're pausing humbly here, but just describe what this has been like and now seeing it on a mass scale against Trump.
[02:04:55.717 --> 02:04:58.180]  Well, it's been extremely difficult.
[02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:00.803]  Financially, they try to break you down.
[02:05:00.823 --> 02:05:04.207]  A federal criminal trial is extremely expensive.
[02:05:04.227 --> 02:05:07.351]  I know, you know, I'm talking, I'm preaching to the choir here, Alex.
[02:05:07.391 --> 02:05:11.896]  But yeah, anybody who wants to fund this appeal can go to memedefensefund.com.
[02:05:12.873 --> 02:05:15.235]  It was extremely difficult for my family.
[02:05:15.695 --> 02:05:24.222]  And going through the trial, they dig up all the old tweets, you know, that have nothing to do with this meme and say, did you say this?
[02:05:24.262 --> 02:05:24.923]  Did you say that?
[02:05:24.963 --> 02:05:33.830]  Because I actually testified at trial and explained that, look, I didn't intend for anybody to actually fall for this meme because how could anybody fall for it?
[02:05:33.850 --> 02:05:35.010]  It's absurd on its face.
[02:05:35.811 --> 02:05:38.953]  But apparently that that doesn't get you anywhere in a federal court.
[02:05:39.954 --> 02:05:44.197]  So it was extremely taxing, extremely difficult.
[02:05:44.677 --> 02:05:51.902]  But if there's anything sort of to gain from it, it's that, you know, in this sort of time, the trials and tribulations, this is where we gather our strength.
[02:05:52.523 --> 02:05:55.365]  And this is where God comes to, you know, those who are in trial.
[02:05:56.752 --> 02:06:02.438]  Well, in my experience, every time the devil kicks me like a horse, God comes in the next day.
[02:06:02.538 --> 02:06:06.082]  So, I don't enjoy the pain, but I always enjoy the aftermath.
[02:06:08.405 --> 02:06:09.145]  Absolutely right.
[02:06:09.245 --> 02:06:10.046]  Absolutely right.
[02:06:10.527 --> 02:06:18.676]  Yeah, so this case was sort of, I really have a lot to say thank you to Tucker Carlson for covering this case from the beginning as you just saw him on there.
[02:06:19.406 --> 02:06:22.788]  But we had to raise a ton of money and we still have to raise a lot more.
[02:06:22.828 --> 02:06:25.889]  But this is not just about me and my difficulties.
[02:06:26.650 --> 02:06:29.211]  No, they can put you in jail for this meme.
[02:06:29.611 --> 02:06:30.371]  None of us are safe.
[02:06:30.431 --> 02:06:31.092]  It's real simple.
[02:06:31.252 --> 02:06:31.832]  Exactly.
[02:06:32.592 --> 02:06:33.093]  Exactly.
[02:06:33.153 --> 02:06:37.115]  And the lengths that they will go to abuse these statutes.
[02:06:37.575 --> 02:06:39.616]  They indicted me on the KKK Act.
[02:06:40.276 --> 02:06:45.839]  Which says you can't injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate anybody in their exercise of civil rights.
[02:06:46.480 --> 02:06:47.961]  Which is completely reasonable, right?
[02:06:48.001 --> 02:06:56.265]  Nobody wants a bunch of men in a hood and masked men to go and beat people up or even, God forbid, kill them for exercising their vote.
[02:06:56.305 --> 02:07:00.768]  But now they just use the name to say injure can be almost anything under the sun.
[02:07:00.848 --> 02:07:07.199]   And if they get, if this conviction is upheld, Then that's going to allow them to get very creative with these words.
[02:07:07.359 --> 02:07:09.620]  Injure, oppress, threaten, intimidate.
[02:07:09.860 --> 02:07:11.300]  Well, that's the easiest way to go.
[02:07:11.320 --> 02:07:13.941]  You hurt somebody's feelings, you go to jail.
[02:07:14.041 --> 02:07:16.522]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[02:07:16.542 --> 02:07:18.643]  We're talking about maybe mental injuries.
[02:07:18.723 --> 02:07:22.404]  Let's see what they can come up with if this conviction stands.
[02:07:23.376 --> 02:07:26.938]  That's why we're committed to go all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary.
[02:07:27.018 --> 02:07:35.042]  Right now we're in the appeals court, Second Circuit, which is New York, basically New York State and Connecticut and Vermont.
[02:07:35.163 --> 02:07:37.164]  So we're in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.
[02:07:38.089 --> 02:07:52.992]  Not only was the statue sort of tortured here, they also brought this case in the Eastern District of New York, despite the fact that I was in the Southern District of New York when I was actually posting these memes way back in 2016.
[02:07:53.792 --> 02:07:56.272]  And this gets right into the Constitution.
[02:07:56.332 --> 02:08:00.433]  We have a right to be tried in the state and district where the crime was committed.
[02:08:01.313 --> 02:08:18.468]   And they just say, well, since the tweets went over the wires, you know, over the bridge, Where the water is surrounding the Eastern District of New York, we can try you in the Eastern District of New York, where they apparently have a very highly ideological office prosecuting this case.
[02:08:18.609 --> 02:08:21.091]  And not only that, they get the jury pool that they want.
[02:08:23.300 --> 02:08:24.100]  It's incredible.
[02:08:24.641 --> 02:08:26.341]  I want to play a few clips here for you.
[02:08:27.261 --> 02:08:33.484]  This is Jacinda Arden, the puppet leader that said, don't look at the sunsets, don't talk to your neighbors.
[02:08:33.924 --> 02:08:38.286]  She's now the UNEU WEF head censor.
[02:08:38.846 --> 02:08:41.367]  And when you listen to this short clip, it's only two minutes, 17 seconds.
[02:08:43.069 --> 02:08:45.833]  She says, well they're against the war, we gotta silence them.
[02:08:46.213 --> 02:08:47.815]  They're against the shots, we gotta silence them.
[02:08:48.256 --> 02:08:49.718]  They've been proven wrong.
[02:08:49.818 --> 02:08:50.879]  NATO started the war.
[02:08:51.240 --> 02:08:52.782]  The poison shots are killing us.
[02:08:53.322 --> 02:08:58.269]  We're just here, not as Russophiles, we're just trying to survive, and they're attacking us.
[02:08:59.969 --> 02:09:01.210]  And calling us disloyal.
[02:09:01.250 --> 02:09:05.954]  And then we've got this clip of the World Jewish Congress President, Ron Lauder.
[02:09:06.134 --> 02:09:08.396]  And I love everybody, Jewish, Christian, Muslim, whatever.
[02:09:08.937 --> 02:09:14.902]  But he says, severe laws are necessary to worldwide order to quell rising anti-Semitism.
[02:09:15.823 --> 02:09:18.786]  The pretext will be used for this.
[02:09:20.153 --> 02:09:26.673]   to silence everybody. So this is so dangerous. I want to play Jacinda Ardern and the world
[02:09:26.673 --> 02:09:32.512]   Jewish congress president back to back because this is dangerous. Here it is.
[02:09:32.512 --> 02:09:36.793]   This week we launched an initiative alongside companies and non-profits to help improve
[02:09:36.793 --> 02:09:42.351]   research and understanding of how a person's online experiences are curated by automated
[02:09:42.351 --> 02:09:48.753]   processes. This will also be important in understanding more about mis- and disinformation
[02:09:48.753 --> 02:09:49.432]  online.
[02:09:49.794 --> 02:09:52.617]  A challenge that we must, as leaders, address.
[02:09:54.018 --> 02:09:57.462]  Sadly, I think it's easy to dismiss this problem as one in the margins.
[02:09:58.262 --> 02:10:01.305]  I can certainly understand the desire to leave it to someone else.
[02:10:02.466 --> 02:10:14.514]  As leaders, we're rightly concerned that even the most light-touch approaches to disinformation could be misinterpreted as being hostile to the values of free speech that we value so highly.
[02:10:15.795 --> 02:10:22.259]  But while I cannot tell you today what the answer is to this challenge, I can say with complete certainty... Well, hit pause.
[02:10:22.279 --> 02:10:23.099]  Back it up ten seconds.
[02:10:23.599 --> 02:10:25.601]  We value free speech and we want to get rid of it.
[02:10:26.485 --> 02:10:27.146]  And what are we doing?
[02:10:27.466 --> 02:10:30.870]  We're saying your shot doesn't work, COVID's not, you know.
[02:10:31.250 --> 02:10:33.913]  Again, this is their whole agenda at the UN.
[02:10:34.313 --> 02:10:37.096]  I've got stacks of articles where this is happening right now in America.
[02:10:37.516 --> 02:10:42.541]  They've got the EU, Brazil, Australia coming after Elon Musk.
[02:10:42.561 --> 02:10:44.103]  I mean, this is the war, folks.
[02:10:44.564 --> 02:10:45.885]  The fight for speech right now.
[02:10:45.905 --> 02:10:46.465]  Finish up.
[02:10:47.687 --> 02:10:48.367]  So highly.
[02:10:49.653 --> 02:10:56.856]  But while I cannot tell you today what the answer is to this challenge, I can say with complete certainty that we cannot ignore it.
[02:10:57.736 --> 02:11:01.598]  To do so poses an equal threat to the norms we all value.
[02:11:02.598 --> 02:11:11.762]  After all, how do you successfully end a war if people are led to believe the reason for its existence is not only legal but noble?
[02:11:12.882 --> 02:11:16.024]  How do you tackle climate change if people do not believe it exists?
[02:11:16.084 --> 02:11:16.604]  It's a fraud!
[02:11:17.064 --> 02:11:24.047]  How do you ensure the human rights of others are upheld when they are subjected to hateful and dangerous rhetoric and ideology?
[02:11:25.488 --> 02:11:31.051]  The weapons may be different, but the goals of those who perpetuate them is often the same.
[02:11:31.991 --> 02:11:35.673]  To cause chaos and reduce the ability of others to defend themselves.
[02:11:36.453 --> 02:11:37.754]  To disband communities.
[02:11:38.554 --> 02:11:41.796]  To collapse the collective strength of countries who work together.
[02:11:43.032 --> 02:11:50.696]  But we have an opportunity here to ensure that these particular weapons of war do not become an established part of warfare.
[02:11:50.716 --> 02:11:57.660]  In these times, I'm acutely aware of how easy it is to feel disheartened.
[02:11:58.561 --> 02:12:01.783]  We are facing many battles on many fronts.
[02:12:02.723 --> 02:12:04.484]  But there is cause for optimism.
[02:12:05.385 --> 02:12:10.188]  Because for every new weapon we face, there is a new tool to overcome it.
[02:12:11.124 --> 02:12:17.506]  For every attempt to push the world into chaos is a collective conviction to bring us back to order.
[02:12:18.407 --> 02:12:19.487]  We have the means.
[02:12:20.468 --> 02:12:23.229]  We just need the collective will.
[02:12:23.729 --> 02:12:27.710]  All world leaders, all politicians must lead in this effort.
[02:12:28.931 --> 02:12:32.012]  Words are not enough.
[02:12:33.573 --> 02:12:36.594]  Political speeches are not enough.
[02:12:38.268 --> 02:12:48.490]  Laws must be passed, severe, tough, real laws that will put these hate mongers away in prison for a long time.
[02:12:51.291 --> 02:12:52.331]  Just like Mick Jagger.
[02:12:52.451 --> 02:12:53.192]  Play the clip in a moment.
[02:12:53.212 --> 02:12:54.692]  Mick Jagger, yesterday.
[02:12:55.092 --> 02:12:55.753]  Oh, I love Trudeau.
[02:12:55.773 --> 02:12:56.513]  Everybody boo's him.
[02:12:56.613 --> 02:13:02.015]  It's all, I guess old people, but it's all a bunch of old people that want to shut everybody up.
[02:13:02.035 --> 02:13:03.155]  Hey, we want World War III.
[02:13:03.175 --> 02:13:03.935]  What's wrong with you?
[02:13:04.295 --> 02:13:06.196]  Hey, we want to put an experimental shot in you.
[02:13:06.216 --> 02:13:06.736]  What's wrong with you?
[02:13:07.036 --> 02:13:08.597]  Hey, we want to arrest a guy for a meme.
[02:13:08.637 --> 02:13:09.377]  What's wrong with you?
[02:13:09.737 --> 02:13:11.218]  And we're like, you're the threat.
[02:13:11.338 --> 02:13:12.538]  Leave us alone.
[02:13:12.578 --> 02:13:13.999]  We don't want war with you.
[02:13:15.739 --> 02:13:18.620]  But these 80-year-olds are dangerous, folks.
[02:13:19.701 --> 02:13:20.881]  Go ahead and roll Mick Jagger.
[02:13:22.088 --> 02:13:23.810]  We love your Mr. Trudeau.
[02:13:23.870 --> 02:13:29.775]  I mean, his family's always been such big fans of our fans.
[02:13:29.855 --> 02:13:31.776]  We love your Trudeau.
[02:13:31.796 --> 02:13:32.157]  100,000 people.
[02:13:32.757 --> 02:13:33.918]  Boo!
[02:13:35.820 --> 02:13:36.260]  Got it!
[02:13:36.460 --> 02:13:39.383]  By the way, congratulations on the Canadian soccer team.
[02:13:39.403 --> 02:13:41.365]  He changed the subject to the Canadian soccer team.
[02:13:42.986 --> 02:13:43.807]  So Doug Mack, he...
[02:13:46.368 --> 02:13:50.036]  Putting you in prison, trying to keep you in prison for your free speech.
[02:13:50.618 --> 02:13:51.680]  Don't the globalists get it?
[02:13:51.700 --> 02:13:52.322]  They've lost?
[02:13:52.362 --> 02:13:53.123]  They should just give up?
[02:13:54.932 --> 02:13:55.832]  Well, great question.
[02:13:55.872 --> 02:14:01.675]  This is a very reactionary sentiment that I think we're seeing, which is why so many of these people are 80 years old.
[02:14:02.536 --> 02:14:07.698]  And they're desperate to uphold a system that has brought them, you know, riches, wealth, and fame.
[02:14:07.918 --> 02:14:14.562]  And if they need to destroy the First Amendment to do so, then they're perfectly willing and able to do that.
[02:14:14.702 --> 02:14:22.506]  I mean, not to mention, not to be crass here, but a lot of these people don't have a lot of years left on Earth, and we're going to be dealing with the consequences here.
[02:14:23.630 --> 02:14:30.973]  My case represents a significant escalation because it used to be that the social media companies sort of taking their cues from the government.
[02:14:31.553 --> 02:14:36.415]  They would ban you from their platform and then the media would try to dox you.
[02:14:37.016 --> 02:14:38.116]  But that doesn't work.
[02:14:38.156 --> 02:14:41.317]  So the escalation, the next step is, well, we have to arrest people.
[02:14:41.778 --> 02:14:44.919]  And I hate to break it to you, but you know this better than anyone else.
[02:14:45.479 --> 02:14:50.322]  They're currently writing white papers right now saying here's how we get around the First Amendment.
[02:14:50.762 --> 02:14:59.347]  Here's how we crack down on so-called disinformation, misinformation, which as we all know means either satire or jokes like in my case.
[02:15:00.848 --> 02:15:12.276]   But to be honest with you, there's a kernel of truth in the meme that I spread because who can doubt that if they could get rid of all election integrity measures and just have people text their vote, I think that they would love to have that.
[02:15:12.996 --> 02:15:21.160]  Oh, Schumers, I was going to say, stay there, we've got to go to break, but I want you to go back, but spend a few minutes before we talk about what's currently happening.
[02:15:21.420 --> 02:15:28.003]  People know your name, they know about the case, but spend a few minutes, we've got five minutes to break, about start to finish, in a snapshot, your case.
[02:15:28.063 --> 02:15:31.565]  It's very important, it's historical, it's like patient zero, explain it.
[02:15:32.585 --> 02:15:33.066]  Absolutely.
[02:15:33.926 --> 02:15:35.507]  Thank you.
[02:15:35.527 --> 02:15:35.967]  Start there.
[02:15:36.027 --> 02:15:37.408]  So how did it begin, what happened?
[02:15:38.598 --> 02:15:44.530]  Yeah, so 2016 I posted the meme on Twitter and just forgot about it.
[02:15:44.790 --> 02:15:46.754]  My account was actually banned off Twitter.
[02:15:47.857 --> 02:15:57.920]  Uh, my original account, which had 62,000 followers, and the account that I posted it from was very small, let's say 14,000 followers, and nobody honestly saw this.
[02:15:57.980 --> 02:16:14.934]   A few people chuckled and said, haha, very funny, but then what happened was sort of a radical left-wing professor got a hold of it and said, oh my god, we've uncovered this plot, this plot to hack the election, and they're gonna try to, you know, Fixed the election with these memes and so he got it to
[02:16:14.934 --> 02:16:17.922]   BuzzFeed's attention after that
[02:16:17.922 --> 02:16:22.963]   They they banned my second account and we kind of forgot about it. It just moved on with life
[02:16:22.963 --> 02:16:30.083]   And a lot of things happened and then by the way, they may claim it's criminal today that I'm showing it
[02:16:30.083 --> 02:16:43.754]   Right exactly. You never know what they can do I mean, Pre-Felony of the Day, which is a book by Harvey Silverclay, which basically says if they want to come after you, most of us are committing three felonies every day without even knowing it.
[02:16:44.715 --> 02:16:46.216]  So, you never really know here.
[02:16:46.256 --> 02:16:47.016]  That's the problem.
[02:16:47.056 --> 02:16:53.880]  That's why we need clear laws and clear interpretations of laws by the courts, so that we can preserve our liberties here.
[02:16:53.920 --> 02:16:55.301]  That's what this all gets down to.
[02:16:55.321 --> 02:16:56.662]  No, I agree, and I interrupted though.
[02:16:56.722 --> 02:16:59.963]  So, you put a name out, I haven't even think about it, it's like one tweet.
[02:17:00.384 --> 02:17:01.664]  Boom, you're arrested.
[02:17:01.905 --> 02:17:02.305]  Keep going.
[02:17:03.325 --> 02:17:07.789]  Yeah, then five years later, I'm arrested, indicted, and I'm facing this trial.
[02:17:08.829 --> 02:17:17.777]  I went to trial in spring of 2023, and 30 days before trial, they say, well, we got a co-conspirator of yours, a cooperator.
[02:17:18.477 --> 02:17:25.283]  Some guy I'd never even met, never even talked to on the phone, on Twitter, never anywhere, no direct messages, nothing.
[02:17:26.417 --> 02:17:27.357]  But they don't care.
[02:17:27.397 --> 02:17:36.301]  They wanted to send a message with this case that we're cracking down on disinfo, misinfo, that they're willing to bring a case with this guy who's lying.
[02:17:36.541 --> 02:17:44.004]  And he said, yeah, you know, we totally intended that people would see this meme and not vote and, you know, waste their vote by texting it in.
[02:17:44.764 --> 02:17:49.047]  So they brought this cooperator on the stand and he totally contradicted himself.
[02:17:49.347 --> 02:17:52.769]  When the FBI first met him, he said, no, there was no grand conspiracy.
[02:17:53.290 --> 02:17:57.592]  This was just a joke on the internet, you know, and we're just trying to also rile up the media.
[02:17:57.733 --> 02:17:58.513]  It's trolling.
[02:17:58.993 --> 02:18:04.117]  It's sort of, uh, sort of insider, you know, jargon, whatever you want to call it for, uh, sort of.
[02:18:04.197 --> 02:18:07.699]  Yeah, it's like today they put out a meme saying Alex Jones covers up for Jews.
[02:18:08.139 --> 02:18:09.761]  So I said, no, I'm covering up for Jaws.
[02:18:10.141 --> 02:18:10.761]  It's a joke.
[02:18:11.682 --> 02:18:11.822]  Right.
[02:18:13.078 --> 02:18:13.558]  Exactly.
[02:18:14.058 --> 02:18:18.520]  So, I was convicted at trial after the jury deadlocked twice.
[02:18:19.480 --> 02:18:36.445]  They deliberated three days and there's something called an Allen Charge in federal law where the judge says, well listen, you know, we spent a lot of resources bringing this case, we spent a lot of time, you guys have been here for several days already, so why don't you go back one more time and try really hard to come to a verdict.
[02:18:37.305 --> 02:18:39.847]  And then you see the jury, they start shifting around their seat.
[02:18:39.927 --> 02:18:40.868]  They're looking nervous.
[02:18:40.928 --> 02:18:41.669]  They're looking like this.
[02:18:42.189 --> 02:18:45.372]  And they think that they almost like it's almost like they feel like they committed a crime.
[02:18:46.012 --> 02:18:48.614]  So Friday afternoon, right after lunch, right?
[02:18:49.195 --> 02:18:50.336]  They come back with a verdict.
[02:18:51.116 --> 02:18:54.980]  And at this point, my sentencing happened in November.
[02:18:55.640 --> 02:19:00.565]  I was sentenced to seven months in federal prison and we asked the judge for an appeal bond.
[02:19:00.605 --> 02:19:05.030]  We said, look, there are some serious legal issues with this case and we're going to appeal it.
[02:19:05.671 --> 02:19:09.815]  So let's let's get a bond here so I don't have to go to prison until this is litigated.
[02:19:10.476 --> 02:19:11.417]  And that was denied.
[02:19:11.477 --> 02:19:16.762]  However, we went immediately to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and we actually won our appeal bond.
[02:19:17.483 --> 02:19:23.808]  And the case is now with the judges right now, a panel of three judges, and they're deliberating on it.
[02:19:23.908 --> 02:19:25.009]  We already had our briefs.
[02:19:25.049 --> 02:19:26.390]  We already had our oral arguments.
[02:19:26.950 --> 02:19:34.476]  But what this boils down to is, can this statute be used to prosecute so-called disinformation, misinformation?
[02:19:34.536 --> 02:19:35.297]  Oh, they admit it.
[02:19:35.337 --> 02:19:37.538]  They set the precedent with you, nobody's safe.
[02:19:37.658 --> 02:19:39.180]  Like, literally a joke meme.
[02:19:40.921 --> 02:19:42.982]  This puts them in the position of a ministry of truth.
[02:19:43.911 --> 02:19:48.102]  Which the Supreme Court has slapped down many times, so we feel our appeal is very strong here.
[02:19:48.543 --> 02:19:51.230]  Doug Mackey, let's talk about it all when we come back.
[02:19:51.311 --> 02:19:51.812]  Stay with us.
[02:19:53.029 --> 02:19:55.611]  Your cardiovascular system is under attack.
[02:19:56.191 --> 02:19:56.932]  Everybody knows it.
[02:19:57.412 --> 02:20:04.036]  And I've got in my hands two products that are absolutely insane when it comes to what they do for your body and your overall health.
[02:20:04.657 --> 02:20:07.639]  One of them is the highest grade fish oil you can find.
[02:20:08.099 --> 02:20:09.640]  Everybody knows how good fish oil is.
[02:20:09.900 --> 02:20:10.901]  This is as good as it gets.
[02:20:11.281 --> 02:20:15.303]  And when you purchase it at InfoWarsTore.com, you support the broadcast, a 360 win.
[02:20:16.103 --> 02:20:17.823]  And then of course, Nitric Boost.
[02:20:17.823 --> 02:20:19.462]  You've heard all the rage about this.
[02:20:19.462 --> 02:20:22.862]   A whole bunch of concentrated natural compounds that clean out your blood
[02:20:22.862 --> 02:20:25.022]  and clean out your cardiovascular system.
[02:20:25.022 --> 02:20:30.503]   Everybody should be taking both of these products at infowarrestore.com.
[02:20:30.503 --> 02:20:34.384]   And both of them, by the way, are 40% off for a limited time.
[02:20:34.482 --> 02:20:39.667]  Now the sale's going to end in about two weeks because we've already sold out of more than half of these products since they came back in.
[02:20:39.927 --> 02:20:46.272]  But if you want to get Ultimate Fish Oil and Nitric Boost for 40% off, get them both today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:20:46.472 --> 02:20:48.214]  I want to thank you all for supporting the broadcast.
[02:20:48.434 --> 02:20:51.637]  I want to thank you all for spreading the word because without you, we are nothing.
[02:20:52.446 --> 02:21:02.052]  Alright, so political prisoner zero, Doug Mackey, we're trying to put in prison for seven years, held up on appeal right now for his free speech.
[02:21:02.172 --> 02:21:06.995]  Already arrested, already indicted for a meme we're showing you on the internet right now.
[02:21:07.836 --> 02:21:10.757]  This is so incredibly dangerous.
[02:21:10.778 --> 02:21:11.358]  Continue on.
[02:21:15.182 --> 02:21:30.489]  Yeah, so Alex, one of the important things that happened in this trial, incredible things that happened in this trial, is that the government did not put a single person on the witness stand who said that I saw this meme and I was fooled, I lost my vote.
[02:21:31.269 --> 02:21:39.753]  They went and actually subpoenaed all the phone numbers of people who texted this shortcode, because one of these internet companies owns the shortcode.
[02:21:40.615 --> 02:21:42.016]  First of all, that I didn't even create.
[02:21:42.076 --> 02:21:43.777]  I just found it online and posted it.
[02:21:44.298 --> 02:21:51.783]  And they went around and knocked on everybody's door in the Eastern District of New York and said, did you see this meme?
[02:21:51.883 --> 02:21:55.746]  And first of all, they could only find like 10 people in the entire district.
[02:21:56.773 --> 02:21:59.595]  And they said, well, no, of course not.
[02:22:00.455 --> 02:22:01.176]  I'm not stupid.
[02:22:01.956 --> 02:22:03.637]  And some of them didn't even remember seeing it.
[02:22:04.278 --> 02:22:05.478]  But it was complete.
[02:22:05.538 --> 02:22:06.859]  It was a complete farce.
[02:22:07.600 --> 02:22:18.746]  They had zero actual evidence that I had even entered into a conspiracy with this guy that they found across the country that I had never even spoken to.
[02:22:18.826 --> 02:22:19.987]  And they got him on the stand.
[02:22:20.047 --> 02:22:22.769]  And he just said whatever they wanted him to.
[02:22:23.644 --> 02:22:25.184]  And the guy had zero credibility.
[02:22:25.244 --> 02:22:28.705]  But ultimately, at the end of the day, that doesn't really matter.
[02:22:28.765 --> 02:22:34.947]  If they can try you in the right district where they can get the right jury, then I think you don't really even stand a chance.
[02:22:34.987 --> 02:22:37.108]  We saw this with Trump's trial in Manhattan.
[02:22:37.808 --> 02:22:39.728]  So it's just unbelievable.
[02:22:40.289 --> 02:22:44.170]  But the good news is, yeah, I haven't had to go to prison yet for seven months yet.
[02:22:44.190 --> 02:22:46.530]  And it's it's people laugh when they hear it.
[02:22:46.610 --> 02:22:47.230]  Seven months.
[02:22:47.350 --> 02:22:49.111]  They hear, oh, you know, you posted a meme.
[02:22:49.171 --> 02:22:52.212]  OK, they got seven months in federal prison.
[02:22:53.134 --> 02:22:56.736]  Fortunately, we're still on appeal, and we're still fighting the case.
[02:22:56.756 --> 02:23:05.899]  We have an excellent legal team, and we're collecting donations at MemeDefenseFund.com just because this costs hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars just to fight this case.
[02:23:06.600 --> 02:23:13.783]  So, it's unbelievable what's happening, and this is, like I said, a market assault, market escalation in the assault on the First Amendment.
[02:23:14.043 --> 02:23:19.145]  They're white-papering this kind of... Oh, and one good thing the left is good at is they stick together.
[02:23:19.625 --> 02:23:22.387]  Conservatives, we're all just rogue, we're living our life.
[02:23:22.407 --> 02:23:24.528]  I don't, I won't worry about you, don't worry about me.
[02:23:24.888 --> 02:23:26.129]  We've got to stick together.
[02:23:26.149 --> 02:23:27.670]  I mean, here's a little microcosm example.
[02:23:27.990 --> 02:23:29.431]  The media will have fun with this, I don't care.
[02:23:29.451 --> 02:23:34.494]  I, I, I literally have lost everything I have.
[02:23:34.574 --> 02:23:35.835]  I don't care about stuff.
[02:23:37.395 --> 02:23:44.584]  Except now they're literally down to repossessing my car today that they just hauled off five minutes ago, which is fine.
[02:23:44.644 --> 02:23:46.366]  I'll give me a car.
[02:23:46.386 --> 02:23:47.026]  I'll take care of it.
[02:23:47.087 --> 02:23:47.687]  It's not a problem.
[02:23:48.208 --> 02:23:51.752]  But my point is, they got up in the stand and wouldn't let me respond.
[02:23:51.792 --> 02:23:53.694]  A judge found me guilty in both cases.
[02:23:54.355 --> 02:24:00.500]  And they had HBO film cameras and the judges patted on their faces and said, he's got 400 million and he made it off these people.
[02:24:00.760 --> 02:24:04.043]  Never, barely ever talked about them, never did the things they said I did.
[02:24:04.423 --> 02:24:05.084]  They didn't care.
[02:24:05.104 --> 02:24:06.145]  And now they're in the New York Times.
[02:24:06.685 --> 02:24:08.347]  Well, Jones has meager assets.
[02:24:08.387 --> 02:24:09.628]  Turns out he has almost nothing.
[02:24:10.327 --> 02:24:11.807]  It would be okay if I had a bunch of money.
[02:24:11.867 --> 02:24:12.848]  I wish I had it to fight back.
[02:24:12.968 --> 02:24:13.848]  I never had it.
[02:24:13.888 --> 02:24:14.628]  It was a lie.
[02:24:15.388 --> 02:24:17.349]  So just the point is, they think you don't have a memory.
[02:24:17.529 --> 02:24:19.729]  Everything they said was a lie, folks.
[02:24:20.370 --> 02:24:21.950]  Everything they pushed was a fraud.
[02:24:22.610 --> 02:24:26.671]  And if they can put you in jail for a meme, they have an incredibly dangerous precedent.
[02:24:26.691 --> 02:24:28.452]  So we are all you, Mr. Mackey.
[02:24:30.212 --> 02:24:30.672]  Exactly.
[02:24:30.732 --> 02:24:32.052]  It doesn't matter if they lie.
[02:24:32.453 --> 02:24:35.393]  They can get away with it in this sort of legalistic system that we have here.
[02:24:35.413 --> 02:24:37.214]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[02:24:38.829 --> 02:24:42.033]  What they did to you, Alex, is, you know, it's exactly the same thing.
[02:24:42.073 --> 02:24:43.554]  Like you said, and I'm with you.
[02:24:43.575 --> 02:24:44.415]  I'm the same boat as you.
[02:24:44.435 --> 02:24:46.918]  I don't care about possessions, money, cars, whatever.
[02:24:47.559 --> 02:24:48.680]  I'm the same exact boat as you.
[02:24:48.740 --> 02:24:53.746]  I'm just trying to pay the lawyers here in case, you know, especially if we need to go to Supreme Court, we're going to have to raise a lot of money.
[02:24:53.766 --> 02:24:54.347]  No, exactly.
[02:24:55.108 --> 02:24:56.830]  We don't sell out for money.
[02:24:58.493 --> 02:25:00.155]  But we need money to fight, folks.
[02:25:00.195 --> 02:25:00.916]  Trump needs money.
[02:25:01.096 --> 02:25:01.616]  I need money.
[02:25:01.917 --> 02:25:02.677]  They should support you.
[02:25:02.717 --> 02:25:03.478]  They should support us.
[02:25:03.859 --> 02:25:04.619]  With word of mouth.
[02:25:04.660 --> 02:25:05.460]  Just share the articles.
[02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:06.101]  Share the videos.
[02:25:06.141 --> 02:25:06.842]  Make a donation.
[02:25:07.162 --> 02:25:07.783]  Buy a product.
[02:25:07.803 --> 02:25:09.485]  Because we're in a war, people!
[02:25:09.505 --> 02:25:13.629]  It's not like we're some theater show and it's like one other flavor of BS.
[02:25:13.769 --> 02:25:14.850]  We're in the fight.
[02:25:15.151 --> 02:25:16.512]  The enemy's coming after us.
[02:25:16.552 --> 02:25:17.913]  They've named us for death.
[02:25:18.594 --> 02:25:19.996]  It's not like we're just pretending.
[02:25:22.043 --> 02:25:22.543]  Exactly.
[02:25:22.623 --> 02:25:25.886]  And if we push back now, then they're going to have to think twice.
[02:25:25.986 --> 02:25:32.630]  I mean, we're already seeing this lawfare's backfire on them where they're sheepishly backing down from all these prosecutions.
[02:25:32.670 --> 02:25:34.692]  They already canceled Trump's sentencing hearing.
[02:25:35.572 --> 02:25:42.297]  And now they're realizing, wow, this guy's... I was about to say, the good news is most patriots have to die and never see victory.
[02:25:43.342 --> 02:25:46.847]  Like, I don't want to say Vincent Van Gogh was a patriot, but he was a great artist.
[02:25:47.227 --> 02:25:50.271]  He died homeless, no money, mentally ill.
[02:25:50.892 --> 02:25:53.255]  Biggest artist in the world was paying himself for $200 million apiece.
[02:25:53.916 --> 02:25:56.479]  We don't have to wait 100 years later to be victorious.
[02:25:57.140 --> 02:25:58.301]  We are victorious now!
[02:26:01.448 --> 02:26:01.948]  Exactly.
[02:26:02.108 --> 02:26:05.009]  And we got to be willing to pay the price and keep fighting.
[02:26:05.769 --> 02:26:07.830]  And that's one of the things I learned on this case.
[02:26:07.910 --> 02:26:09.050]  It's so scary, right?
[02:26:09.090 --> 02:26:21.393]  They drag you to the local federal courthouse and put you in the holding cell and the leg guards and they're trying to pressure you into just dealing and doing a plea deal or whatever.
[02:26:21.433 --> 02:26:25.575]  But if you are in the right, then stand up, fight back.
[02:26:25.915 --> 02:26:30.556]  And we have to push back because if we roll over, then they're just on to the next case.
[02:26:33.558 --> 02:26:35.159]  Well, I've asked a lot of questions here.
[02:26:35.459 --> 02:26:37.479]  You're political prisoner patient zero.
[02:26:37.499 --> 02:26:38.260]  What else you want to add?
[02:26:39.980 --> 02:26:43.961]  Yeah, so like I said, MemeDefenseFund.com, that's where you can find this case.
[02:26:44.021 --> 02:26:48.003]  It's a non-profit, 501c3 or 4, whatever it is.
[02:26:48.583 --> 02:26:49.923]  MemeDefenseFund.com.
[02:26:50.083 --> 02:26:57.946]  But if there's one other thing about this case I would point out, they're using the statute that they convicted me on against President Trump.
[02:26:58.346 --> 02:27:00.567]  They're saying that he injured the right to vote.
[02:27:01.542 --> 02:27:07.064]  By, you know, challenging the result of the election, that he's injuring people's right to vote.
[02:27:07.284 --> 02:27:10.606]  It's complete torture, complete abuse of the statute here.
[02:27:11.326 --> 02:27:13.607]  And it's not like this is a fool's errand either.
[02:27:13.647 --> 02:27:17.949]  We just saw these two cases that actually bode very well for my case, Fisher.
[02:27:18.749 --> 02:27:50.900]   Snyder the government said you cannot go and arrest people and convict people for these ambiguous crimes there has to be a clear-cut violation of the statute there have to be there have to be clear lines drawn on these statutes but they don't care about that they're also using the statute against pro-lifers to stack counts against them so that they Either they're pressured into pleading guilty, or if they get convicted, instead of getting, you know, getting, you know, three months, six months, or even probation, now they're actually looking at years.
[02:27:50.960 --> 02:28:05.290]  They just sentenced a pro-life protester who, I don't know what they did, blinked arms outside of a abortion clinic or whatever, and maybe disrupted the clinic for 15 minutes, to 48 months in federal prison.
[02:28:06.246 --> 02:28:08.848]  And it's using the same exact statute.
[02:28:09.388 --> 02:28:11.570]  That's why we need to fight back in this case.
[02:28:11.630 --> 02:28:20.797]  And if you if you fund my appeal, not only are we fighting my case, but we're fighting this out of precedent for these pro-lifers, for President Trump's case.
[02:28:21.277 --> 02:28:23.158]  So it's all interrelated.
[02:28:23.258 --> 02:28:24.199]  It's all linked together.
[02:28:24.399 --> 02:28:29.403]  And it's no coincidence because there's actors that are conspiring.
[02:28:29.443 --> 02:28:30.524]  They had a white paper written up.
[02:28:31.084 --> 02:28:44.052]  How are we going to ban election disinformation without the Congress going and actually passing a law, which they tried to do twice under Obama and in the most recent Congress and failed to pass the law.
[02:28:44.092 --> 02:28:45.453]  So they said, we don't need to pass the law.
[02:28:45.473 --> 02:28:46.814]  We're just get real creative with it.
[02:28:47.714 --> 02:28:48.915]  And we'll just go and arrest people.
[02:28:48.995 --> 02:28:52.477]  And you have to fight for years and years until you're actually vindicated.
[02:28:55.717 --> 02:29:05.928]  And again, for people that just joined us because we're on hundreds of radio stations, recap what happened to you and the timeline of the case and then tie it into the election with 115 days left.
[02:29:06.369 --> 02:29:10.654]  But I'm worried about the 79 days between Trump as president-elect and becoming inaugurated.
[02:29:10.674 --> 02:29:13.477]  What do you think the system's going to pull, knowing how desperate they are?
[02:29:14.673 --> 02:29:19.976]  Well, I shudder to think of what they will actually pull because right now they're using legal means.
[02:29:20.477 --> 02:29:25.360]  God forbid they decide they actually want to escalate even further to using illegal means.
[02:29:26.160 --> 02:29:38.788]  I was arrested in 2021 for posting a meme in 2016, which is hard to believe in and of itself, saying that Hillary Clinton voters could text their vote and skip the line to 55925 or whatever the number was.
[02:29:40.987 --> 02:29:43.389]  Which obviously, on its face, is absurd.
[02:29:43.489 --> 02:29:44.089]  It's a joke.
[02:29:44.930 --> 02:29:54.476]  And they said you were conspiring with 50 other people in DM chat groups on Twitter and retweeting and sharing hashtags.
[02:29:54.516 --> 02:29:59.319]  Therefore, you were conspiring to injure people in the exercise of their right to vote.
[02:30:00.039 --> 02:30:04.863]  And I was actually convicted in Brooklyn, even though the case had nothing to do with Brooklyn.
[02:30:05.914 --> 02:30:09.079]  And that's a violation of the Constitution in and of itself.
[02:30:09.800 --> 02:30:11.902]  And now we're fighting the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.
[02:30:11.962 --> 02:30:19.793]  I actually won the bond appeal to say I can get a bond to stay out of prison while this appeal is being played out.
[02:30:19.933 --> 02:30:22.157]  We have a very strong appeal, very strong case.
[02:30:22.802 --> 02:30:34.593]  And look, the other thing is, if we lose the Second Circuit, we're going to go to the Supreme Court, because if we win there, then we can set a nationwide precedent that this statute cannot be abused in this way.
[02:30:34.833 --> 02:30:35.413]  Absolutely.
[02:30:35.513 --> 02:30:42.980]  So in closing, what do you make of the EU trying to indict Australia, Brazil trying to indict Elon Musk?
[02:30:43.701 --> 02:30:45.442]  I'm not here to be Elon Musk's apologist.
[02:30:46.283 --> 02:30:49.764]  He's going way towards us, giving us one of the best bases we've got.
[02:30:49.784 --> 02:30:54.365]  I couldn't lie and say, oh, he's not perfect, you know, he wants self-driving cars or whatever.
[02:30:54.385 --> 02:30:58.746]  I'm already telling what I think, but what do you think of Elon Musk?
[02:31:00.267 --> 02:31:01.847]  It's a political punishment.
[02:31:02.407 --> 02:31:12.270]  The bottom line is, if he was just making electric cars and donating to Obama like he used to, donating to Biden, re-election, he would not be facing any of these investigations.
[02:31:13.120 --> 02:31:30.038]  And not to mention his real sin was buying Twitter and turning it into X. Because if you allow free speech, then the problem is there are certain ideas that the opposition is pushing that are so extremely popular, busting criminals out onto the street, censoring social media.
[02:31:30.911 --> 02:31:34.830]   and you can go on and on down the lines, sending all of our money overseas.
[02:31:34.830 --> 02:31:40.991]   So if they allow free speech on X, their concern is that this will create a snowball effect
[02:31:40.991 --> 02:31:45.551]   and pretty soon they're all going to be out of power. So that's the danger.
[02:31:45.551 --> 02:31:47.391]  That's why they're going to pressure Elon Musk.
[02:31:47.391 --> 02:31:53.680]   Exactly. So all these purer than thou people say, well, he's done some bad things in the past. Christ said
[02:31:53.680 --> 02:31:55.551]  you judge a tree by its fruits.
[02:31:55.748 --> 02:31:59.272]  He is irrevocably damaging their entire worldwide censor system.
[02:31:59.772 --> 02:32:03.876]  They're coming after him, and he's allowing all his people to come on and tell the truth.
[02:32:04.297 --> 02:32:05.418]  You can't argue with that.
[02:32:05.498 --> 02:32:10.103]  I mean, that is... What will we do with... Imagine the world today if Elon hadn't done this.
[02:32:12.182 --> 02:32:12.642]  Exactly.
[02:32:12.822 --> 02:32:13.563]  I'm no saint.
[02:32:14.163 --> 02:32:15.084]  I'm certainly no saint.
[02:32:15.104 --> 02:32:16.064]  You're certainly no saint.
[02:32:16.244 --> 02:32:17.565]  Elon Musk is no saint.
[02:32:18.245 --> 02:32:25.569]  But we can't get into this sort of pharisaical hair splitting here about, oh, look at this thing happened 10 years ago with this guy, whatever.
[02:32:25.709 --> 02:32:27.570]  And this is what the media wants to do.
[02:32:27.710 --> 02:32:28.970]  This is what they did when they doxed me.
[02:32:29.091 --> 02:32:30.111]  Oh, look what he said here.
[02:32:30.171 --> 02:32:30.931]  Look what he said there.
[02:32:31.412 --> 02:32:34.833]  And then people go, oh, geez, I don't want to support him.
[02:32:34.893 --> 02:32:35.854]  Look what he said there.
[02:32:36.014 --> 02:32:41.757]  And, you know, I would point out to Alex that they didn't care about you and Sandy Hook.
[02:32:42.552 --> 02:32:45.746]  Until Trump won the election, partly because you were backing him.
[02:32:46.308 --> 02:32:47.071]  They didn't care at all.
[02:32:48.058 --> 02:32:53.620]  This happened because they look for ways to punish people by any means necessary if they're influential.
[02:32:54.440 --> 02:32:56.021]  So it's sort of a rigged game, right?
[02:32:56.501 --> 02:33:01.043]  If you're low-level and no one cares, and you can basically say whatever you want, do whatever you want.
[02:33:01.083 --> 02:33:05.184]  You've got people marching in the streets doing all sorts of crazy things, but no one cares.
[02:33:05.725 --> 02:33:11.006]  But as soon as you rise up to a certain level, it doesn't actually matter what your ideology is.
[02:33:11.707 --> 02:33:16.729]   It doesn't matter exactly the fine points of your ideology.
[02:33:16.769 --> 02:33:22.493]  What matters is that you're influential and you're going against the establishment's prerogatives.
[02:33:23.754 --> 02:33:25.215]  Doug Mackey, perfectly said.
[02:33:25.255 --> 02:33:29.558]  People can find you at memedefensefund.com and gibsongo.com.
[02:33:29.578 --> 02:33:31.420]  Douglas Mackey, key case.
[02:33:31.440 --> 02:33:33.981]  I want to talk to you again and get an update in the next few weeks.
[02:33:34.021 --> 02:33:34.742]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:33:35.743 --> 02:33:36.143]  Thank you.
[02:33:36.583 --> 02:33:36.964]  God bless.
[02:33:37.624 --> 02:33:40.866]  Yeah, such an important case and he is smart and he totally nailed it.
[02:33:42.167 --> 02:33:42.948]  All right, so.
[02:33:45.037 --> 02:33:53.159]  I asked Derren McBrain, one of our great researchers, hours ago on air, you heard me, he already got it ready, to show a few clips of the media saying illegals aren't voting.
[02:33:53.599 --> 02:33:55.079]  Now they're like, of course illegals are voting.
[02:33:55.440 --> 02:33:56.260]  What's the big deal?
[02:33:56.540 --> 02:33:57.320]  What's the problem?
[02:33:58.040 --> 02:33:58.800]  Why aren't you for it?
[02:33:58.860 --> 02:34:05.402]  And then Chase Geiser put out a really funny video from the show yesterday, where I did my imitation of Biden during the debate.
[02:34:06.502 --> 02:34:07.622]  And we're going to play that too.
[02:34:07.702 --> 02:34:10.063]  Joe Biden possesses Alex Jones in shock video.
[02:34:12.023 --> 02:34:13.084]  That is coming up.
[02:34:13.104 --> 02:34:14.104]  But here's McBrain's report.
[02:34:18.852 --> 02:34:24.596]  Santa Ana could become the latest city in the country to allow non-citizens to vote at the ballot box.
[02:34:25.296 --> 02:34:28.338]  Non-citizens are prohibited from voting in federal elections.
[02:34:28.378 --> 02:34:35.203]  But municipalities in Maryland, Vermont, and here in California have allowed non-citizens to vote in local elections.
[02:34:35.243 --> 02:34:38.785]  Former President Trump says he wants to return to the White House to secure the southern U.S.
[02:34:38.845 --> 02:34:39.085]  border.
[02:34:39.365 --> 02:34:44.689]  He claims Democrats are allowing immigrants into the country and signing them up to vote.
[02:34:45.089 --> 02:34:48.152]  I believe now that that's why they're allowing these people to come in.
[02:34:48.212 --> 02:34:51.715]  People that don't speak our language, they're signing them up to vote.
[02:34:52.016 --> 02:34:52.716]  Is that right?
[02:34:52.976 --> 02:34:55.759]  No, what he suggested isn't even possible.
[02:34:55.859 --> 02:34:59.883]  If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal.
[02:35:02.095 --> 02:35:12.981]  Okay, here we are again in the unusual position of not only interrupting the President of the United States, but correcting the President of the United States.
[02:35:13.161 --> 02:35:16.802]  There are no illegal votes that we know of.
[02:35:17.203 --> 02:35:17.683]  That's right.
[02:35:17.963 --> 02:35:20.984]  Brian, we just heard the President come out pretty remarkable, as you said.
[02:35:21.044 --> 02:35:25.026]  He said, quote, according to the legal votes, he believes he wins.
[02:35:25.566 --> 02:35:26.287]  That's false.
[02:35:26.506 --> 02:35:33.306]   the supposed epidemic of undocumented immigrants voting in presidential elections,
[02:35:33.306 --> 02:35:38.265]   something they legally cannot do, and there is no evidence whatsoever that they are doing.
[02:35:38.265 --> 02:35:41.707]   How are they going to, they know that they're losing, you know how they're going to keep on to it?
[02:35:41.707 --> 02:35:45.306]   The 22 million, Michael, that are coming in here illegally, those people are going to vote.
[02:35:45.306 --> 02:35:46.746]   That's their only- People can't vote.
[02:35:46.746 --> 02:35:47.466]  Yes, they can.
[02:35:47.466 --> 02:35:52.185]   Bottom line is when Joe Biden got elected, he said he wanted to fast track
[02:35:52.185 --> 02:35:56.586]  4 million undocumented residents to full citizenship.
[02:35:56.586 --> 02:36:01.546]   I would in fact make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[02:36:01.829 --> 02:36:02.369]  They're illegals.
[02:36:02.449 --> 02:36:03.029]  Of course you are!
[02:36:03.109 --> 02:36:08.071]  Undocumented immigrants are not citizens, therefore they cannot legally attest that they are.
[02:36:07.890 --> 02:36:09.890]  He's helping us here.
[02:36:09.890 --> 02:36:11.890]  I'm a Biden majority.
[02:36:11.890 --> 02:36:13.890]  He says he's helping us for Biden.
[02:36:13.890 --> 02:36:15.890]  Of course you are!
[02:36:15.890 --> 02:36:17.890]  Of course for Biden.
[02:36:17.890 --> 02:36:21.890]   Undocumented immigrants are not citizens, therefore they cannot legally attest that they are.
[02:36:21.890 --> 02:36:24.890]  So we rate Donald Trump's claim as false.
[02:36:24.890 --> 02:36:28.890]   At the end of the day, there's just no proof to support Trump's theory.
[02:36:28.890 --> 02:36:30.890]  And that's why the Truth-O-Meter rates his claim...
[02:36:30.890 --> 02:36:35.890]  Pants on fire. Read a full fact check at WRAL.com.
[02:36:35.811 --> 02:36:39.354]  Republicans want to throw up barriers because when people vote, they lose.
[02:36:39.794 --> 02:36:42.617]  Let me be clear, they don't want you to vote.
[02:36:43.097 --> 02:36:47.781]  They don't want to hear black voices, brown voices, LGBTQIA voices, young voices.
[02:36:48.202 --> 02:36:51.064]  Our fundamental access to our democracy is being politicized.
[02:36:51.625 --> 02:36:56.489]  And this xenophobic attack that we're debating today will make it harder for Americans to vote.
[02:36:57.029 --> 02:37:02.790]  I am not aware of a single proof of citizenship document that does not cost an individual money to get it.
[02:37:03.531 --> 02:37:08.392]  Unless we are requiring every state to provide one for free and then it's an unfunded mandate.
[02:37:09.012 --> 02:37:14.973]  This is the 2024 version of the Jim Crow poll tax and we should vote against it.
[02:37:15.173 --> 02:37:23.095]  To investigate claims of voter fraud by non-citizens was disbanded without identifying one single case.
[02:37:23.895 --> 02:37:32.099]  If we believe in the power of democracy, we should reject discriminatory rules rooted in fear and division, and instead increase protections and expand access.
[02:37:32.499 --> 02:37:34.160]  This bill, they call it the SAVE Act.
[02:37:34.460 --> 02:37:36.901]  It should be called the Don't Let Americans Act.
[02:37:37.701 --> 02:37:39.182]  Don't Let Americans Vote Act.
[02:37:39.542 --> 02:37:47.265]  House Republicans' so-called SAVE Act is a dangerous, anti-democratic bill that has no place on this floor.
[02:37:47.806 --> 02:37:49.947]  Only citizens can vote for the United States Senate.
[02:37:50.346 --> 02:37:56.627]   Only citizens can vote for the presidency of the United States.
[02:37:56.627 --> 02:38:02.945]   So this extreme Republican voter suppression bill is not designed to solve any problem
[02:38:02.945 --> 02:38:05.265]  on behalf of the American people.
[02:38:05.265 --> 02:38:13.065]   It is designed to jam people up and prevent Americans from voting.
[02:38:13.065 --> 02:38:20.166]   From Brooklyn, New York, we have a diaspora that can absorb a significant number of these
[02:38:20.166 --> 02:38:21.166]  migrants.
[02:38:21.166 --> 02:38:24.826]   I need more people in my district, but just for redistricting purposes.
[02:38:24.826 --> 02:38:29.786]   My Republican colleagues will claim that requiring IDs is a small ask, but nearly 30
[02:38:29.786 --> 02:38:31.826]  million people lack a valid driver's license.
[02:38:31.826 --> 02:38:36.906]   And about 15 to 18 million adults don't have access to documents proving their birth or
[02:38:36.906 --> 02:38:38.065]  citizenship.
[02:38:38.065 --> 02:38:40.506]  Americans don't need more obstacles.
[02:38:41.090 --> 02:38:46.690]   hard enough. For Republicans is for them to lay the groundwork to undermine the outcome
[02:38:46.690 --> 02:38:52.449]   of the presidential election just as they did four years ago. Just as they will again and again
[02:38:52.449 --> 02:38:59.570]   until they realize either the futility of this exercise or the republic crumbles. I pray for the
[02:38:59.570 --> 02:39:05.650]   former. Non-citizens have not been eligible to vote in New York or for as far as I know in any
[02:39:05.650 --> 02:39:11.250]   other state since the 19th century. If you want to vote and you show up at your polling place
[02:39:11.250 --> 02:39:14.050]  they can't stop you from voting.
[02:39:14.229 --> 02:39:15.430]  They can't stop you from voting.
[02:39:15.670 --> 02:39:19.633]  If people want to know how to vote, then you can go to IWillVote.com.
[02:39:19.813 --> 02:39:28.220]  Many of the millennials, dreamers, undocumented citizens, and I call them citizens because they contribute to this country, are fearful of voting.
[02:39:28.380 --> 02:39:31.882]  So if I vote, will immigration know where I live?
[02:39:32.063 --> 02:39:33.864]  Will they come for my family and deport us?
[02:39:34.364 --> 02:39:34.785]  Not true.
[02:39:35.485 --> 02:39:48.951]   And the reason is, first of all, when you vote, You are a citizen yourself, and there is not a situation where the voting rolls somehow are transferred over and people start investigating, etc.
[02:39:49.311 --> 02:39:54.834]  The saying to the vote is strictly confidential in terms of who you voted for.
[02:39:55.113 --> 02:40:03.113]   If you have a family member who maybe is undocumented, then you have an even greater reason to vote.
[02:40:03.113 --> 02:40:12.952]  Illegals are voting everywhere.
[02:40:13.072 --> 02:40:13.852]  That's a great video.
[02:40:13.892 --> 02:40:14.812]  We should add a few more clips.
[02:40:14.832 --> 02:40:20.355]  We'll post the X with them on the news saying illegals voting, illegals of the police, illegals of the military.
[02:40:20.535 --> 02:40:23.856]  Add that, we'll put it on X. Great video, great report, great job putting it together.
[02:40:24.477 --> 02:40:35.061]   So, yesterday with Chase Geiser during the spaces on X, I channeled Joe Biden with his vacant face he makes and I hope you share it. It's a real
[02:40:35.061 --> 02:40:39.581]   Alex Jones on X Chase guys are reposted. He's called it gold. I said Joe
[02:40:39.581 --> 02:40:42.990]   Biden Possesses Alex Jones and shocks video. Here it is
[02:40:43.072 --> 02:40:49.911]   That were questionable, but I think that he's definitely slowing and he's showing his age and I don't think that his
[02:40:49.911 --> 02:40:53.672]   administration Can't perform the duties of president. I
[02:40:54.207 --> 02:40:55.887]  I think that they can do that just fine.
[02:40:56.308 --> 02:41:01.289]  But I do think that leading up to November, it's going to hurt him immensely.
[02:41:02.050 --> 02:41:08.932]  And if the Democrats really want a chance at beating Trump, I think they need to replace him, put somebody else, get somebody else.
[02:41:10.653 --> 02:41:10.953]  All right.
[02:41:14.154 --> 02:41:15.175]  Who's host of the fourth hour?
[02:41:15.215 --> 02:41:15.815]  I forget to ask.
[02:41:18.769 --> 02:41:23.753]  The great Drew Hernandez is hosting the fourth hour today.

[02:43:17.261 --> 02:43:18.402]  We're not backing down.

[02:43:48.700 --> 02:43:50.720]  The media lied and said we had hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:43:51.101 --> 02:43:53.281]  Now the New York Times says Jones is out of money.
[02:43:53.521 --> 02:43:54.361]  I never had that money.
[02:43:54.381 --> 02:43:58.363]  It was all a lie to make you think I was telling you we needed support when we needed it.
[02:43:59.623 --> 02:44:01.584]  They wanted you to believe I was a liar.
[02:44:02.044 --> 02:44:02.804]  But we've been proven right.
[02:44:04.517 --> 02:44:05.517]  I have stood in the gap.
[02:44:06.098 --> 02:44:08.619]  I am not back down, but I need your support now.
[02:44:09.279 --> 02:44:15.361]  Could be, you know, we'll be here a few more months now, the judges said, and there's a chance to keep us on air, but we're still here at least two, three months.
[02:44:15.942 --> 02:44:18.463]  But if you don't buy the products, that's the only thing that can shut us down.

[02:44:43.443 --> 02:44:47.843]   I'm doing, and the great Drew Hernandez takes over in two minutes after this break.
[02:44:47.980 --> 02:44:48.961]  But the ball's in your court.
[02:44:49.402 --> 02:44:50.042]  I'm in your hands.
[02:44:50.603 --> 02:44:51.324]  It's up to you now.
[02:44:51.684 --> 02:44:56.450]  drjonesnaturals.com, infowarestore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:44:56.770 --> 02:45:00.334]  Hour number four, straight ahead, and then Owen Schroer with the War Room, 3 p.m.
[02:45:01.943 --> 02:45:04.265]  I don't know what I'd do if I saw Fauci walking down the street or Bill Gates.
[02:45:04.345 --> 02:45:07.067]  I mean, he's so outrageously evil.
[02:45:07.507 --> 02:45:08.988]  He's such a murderer!
[02:45:09.449 --> 02:45:15.073]  And we need to have... You're a Christian, you're a father, you're a theologian, you're able to be really calm and nice about this.
[02:45:15.113 --> 02:45:18.535]  I know you're pissed off about it, but... The thing is, take action, folks.
[02:45:18.595 --> 02:45:19.256]  Resist them.
[02:45:19.576 --> 02:45:20.737]  Protect yourself from them.
[02:45:20.857 --> 02:45:21.598]  Expose them.
[02:45:22.418 --> 02:45:25.741]  What do we do biblically, do you think, to just spiritually be able to deal with this?
[02:45:26.806 --> 02:45:31.069]  Well, we can't deal with stuff like this on our own.
[02:45:31.530 --> 02:45:32.891]  You have to lean on God.
[02:45:33.631 --> 02:45:34.172]  You have to.
[02:45:34.212 --> 02:45:38.435]  Because when you look at what He is, He knows the beginning from the end.
[02:45:38.475 --> 02:45:40.417]  He knows everything that we're going through.
[02:45:41.017 --> 02:45:43.819]  In the midst of the storm, He brings peace.
[02:45:44.520 --> 02:45:47.202]  We know how this game ends.
[02:45:47.822 --> 02:45:49.063]  And we know who wins.
[02:45:49.944 --> 02:45:50.144]  Right?
[02:45:50.244 --> 02:45:52.685]  And the Bible tells us every knee must bow.
[02:45:53.026 --> 02:45:56.587]  The knee of sickness, the knee of disease, the knee of all these things that we're seeing.
[02:45:57.087 --> 02:45:59.429]  And we know what happens to the devil.
[02:45:59.849 --> 02:46:01.490]  Jesus throws him in the pit.
[02:46:02.230 --> 02:46:02.470]  Right?
[02:46:02.630 --> 02:46:04.891]  And so we know who wins this.
[02:46:04.991 --> 02:46:06.012]  But here's the thing.
[02:46:06.872 --> 02:46:09.975]  God never told us that this life was going to be easy.
[02:46:10.636 --> 02:46:11.497]  He never told us.
[02:46:11.617 --> 02:46:13.279]  In fact, He told us the opposite.
[02:46:13.899 --> 02:46:17.103]  He said, Jesus said, you know, take up your cross and follow me.
[02:46:17.563 --> 02:46:20.846]  People are going to oppose you for following me.
[02:46:21.347 --> 02:46:21.968]  But you know what?
[02:46:22.128 --> 02:46:27.033]  The end result is going to be better if you follow me than if you don't.
[02:46:27.533 --> 02:46:46.251]   Right, so look at the opposition, take the opposition, but never deviate from that path of following truth and following victory and that strength of God who created the universe, who put All of his creativity in us because we were created in his image.
[02:46:46.631 --> 02:46:55.374]  We have to realize we've got that power of God pulsating through our veins every single day because we're created in his image.
[02:46:55.934 --> 02:47:07.817]  And when we do that, we can have confidence that like what Psalms tells us, and we can rest under the shadow of his wings, that the enemy will come near our tent, but they can't come into it, right?
[02:47:08.277 --> 02:47:09.058]  Look at the enemy.
[02:47:09.078 --> 02:47:10.319]  They're all slaves.
[02:47:10.419 --> 02:47:11.600]  Satan always destroys them.
[02:47:11.660 --> 02:47:13.661]  Even before they die, we see them betrayed.
[02:47:14.001 --> 02:47:14.942]  We see them destroyed.
[02:47:14.982 --> 02:47:23.729]  And we see billions and billions of dollars spent by the federal government secretly, with just Walgreens and CVS alone, to not prescribe ivermectin.
[02:47:24.089 --> 02:47:28.812]  So all this evil, you wonder, why are they not giving people the drugs that they now admit works?
[02:47:29.173 --> 02:47:30.414]  Because they wanted to hurt people.
[02:47:30.454 --> 02:47:31.414]  They wanted people fearful.
[02:47:31.695 --> 02:47:36.979]  But it took billions to buy them off to do the evil, and the devil has the control of the purse.
[02:47:37.819 --> 02:47:39.743]  He has the power of the earth right now.
[02:47:39.783 --> 02:47:41.186]  He's the god of this world right now.
[02:47:41.427 --> 02:47:48.601]  But it shows every bit of it is mercenaries working against their own self-interest for a little bit of money.
[02:47:50.094 --> 02:47:51.355]  Our firm is just different.
[02:47:51.776 --> 02:47:55.740]  We charge 8% when you purchase, 0% when you liquidate.
[02:47:56.080 --> 02:48:02.067]  We buy directly from the depository in Shiner, Texas, the Texas Precious Metals Depository.
[02:48:02.507 --> 02:48:06.972]  So their wholesale prices, you tack on 8%, they ship it directly to you.
[02:48:07.412 --> 02:48:14.617]   When you sell it back, we take nothing Zero, and whatever the depository prices are, you get all of it.
[02:48:15.077 --> 02:48:28.521]  See, that's a huge difference from buying a rare coin, something that has a high commission, high premium, where even after the big move in silver that we've seen, you still haven't even broken even.
[02:48:28.801 --> 02:48:35.303]  KEPM.com forward slash gold, check them out, go on the site, call them, get a consultation, email them, talk to them, 720-605-3900.
[02:48:35.323 --> 02:48:42.306]   KEPM.com forward slash gold, KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[02:48:46.648 --> 02:49:06.399]  And for breaking news and updates, be sure and follow me at Real Alex Jones here on X. All righty, InfoWarriors, you are now watching the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:49:06.539 --> 02:49:09.381]  I am your guest host, Drew Hernandez.
[02:49:10.333 --> 02:49:39.558]  As we get closer and closer to this election, I think it's abundantly clear, especially after those last clips that Alex played in the last segment, where Democrats, I mean, it's pretty obvious that they rig elections, they want to rig elections, and replacement migration is part of that plan to replace American lives, American citizens, American votes, and people that are unwilling to accept that reality.
[02:49:41.133 --> 02:49:45.777]  Are still going to be thinking that these elections are free and fair.
[02:49:46.237 --> 02:49:47.498]  And I've been saying this for months.
[02:49:47.518 --> 02:49:54.143]  I've been saying this for a while that I'm not fully convinced that the too big to rig theory.
[02:49:54.163 --> 02:50:04.891]  Is solid enough to lean completely in on so that we get the Trump W in November.
[02:50:04.931 --> 02:50:07.973]  Now Trump has his problems distancing himself from project 2025.
[02:50:10.143 --> 02:50:11.083]  Doesn't make any sense.
[02:50:11.223 --> 02:50:16.245]  I think that's a, I think that's politician Trump, if you really think about it, right?
[02:50:16.265 --> 02:50:25.708]  Because when Trump makes these statements on Truth Social, when he says, I don't really know much about this, but I disagree with some of what they say, that's a politician.
[02:50:25.728 --> 02:50:27.848]  I think that's politician Trump we're getting there.
[02:50:28.748 --> 02:50:49.320]   But when you take a look at the movement and you take a look at just exactly how quickly Democrats are moving, Where everybody is focused on Joe Biden, where everybody is focused on Joe Biden's cognitive and physical decline that we've been witnessing for the past four years, maybe even beyond, right?
[02:50:49.360 --> 02:50:58.124]  We all know that Joe has been losing his mind, even before he decided to announce that he was willing to run for president in 2020.
[02:50:59.145 --> 02:51:00.665]  And we know that means to be installed.
[02:51:01.986 --> 02:51:07.809]  But we know that Democrats want to rig elections into the future.
[02:51:09.386 --> 02:51:21.155]  And when I see this movement and I see Republicans, and I'm still looking for a solid answer to this question, waiting until four to five months out to push the SAVE Act.
[02:51:22.876 --> 02:51:30.822]  Knowing damn well that the Senate's gonna shut it down and knowing damn well that Joe Biden has already vocalized, well, his handlers, right?
[02:51:30.842 --> 02:51:36.907]  Have already instructed him to veto anything of the sort.
[02:51:37.725 --> 02:51:42.189]  That makes it to his Oval Office and his desk.
[02:51:44.130 --> 02:51:50.996]  And are people really under the impression that Republicans are that stupid, that they don't know that?
[02:51:51.016 --> 02:52:00.983]  Are people really under the impression that Republicans are not aware that the Senate is gonna shoot this down?
[02:52:01.044 --> 02:52:03.986]  I mean, Marjorie Taylor Greene told Alex Jones, was it yesterday?
[02:52:04.878 --> 02:52:08.119]  That the SAVE Act is DOA, dead on arrival in the Senate.
[02:52:08.459 --> 02:52:09.139]  It means nothing.
[02:52:09.900 --> 02:52:11.980]  It's not a W. It's not something to celebrate.
[02:52:12.401 --> 02:52:16.162]  And it's not something to say, well, look, Republicans are trying to get it done.
[02:52:16.502 --> 02:52:18.803]  It's just the Democrats that are stalling this.
[02:52:18.823 --> 02:52:20.924]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:52:21.564 --> 02:52:24.825]  I think Republicans think that you're stupid to believe that.
[02:52:25.925 --> 02:52:28.706]  That they're stupid and that incompetent.
[02:52:29.667 --> 02:52:30.187]  No, no, no, no.
[02:52:30.227 --> 02:52:32.688]  These people know damn well what's going on.
[02:52:32.728 --> 02:52:33.728]  It's political theater.
[02:52:34.835 --> 02:52:36.115]  They just need another chip.
[02:52:36.375 --> 02:52:39.616]  And I've seen this all over right-wing Twitter the past 24 hours.
[02:52:40.156 --> 02:52:46.158]  All of these retards up and down right-wing Twitter coming out and saying, well, see, now it's on record.
[02:52:46.398 --> 02:52:47.518]  We have it documented.
[02:52:47.818 --> 02:52:56.940]  So when they rig it in November, we could say, see, see, you guys were the ones that wanted illegals voting, so gotcha.
[02:52:57.160 --> 02:52:57.720]  And then what?
[02:52:58.620 --> 02:52:59.161]  And then what?
[02:53:00.221 --> 02:53:00.801]  What, then what?
[02:53:02.762 --> 02:53:10.686]  Just so right wing watered down talking heads and pundits can say, see, see, gotcha!
[02:53:12.407 --> 02:53:12.928]  And then what?
[02:53:13.688 --> 02:53:21.252]  This watered down Republican Party that hasn't done anything that's actually gonna matter in this 2024 election, the past four years?
[02:53:21.412 --> 02:53:22.833]  What, then they're gonna do something?
[02:53:23.413 --> 02:53:26.615]  When the Republic is fully hijacked and fallen in November?
[02:53:27.135 --> 02:53:27.795]  I don't believe it.
[02:53:28.776 --> 02:53:29.376]  I don't believe it.
[02:53:29.396 --> 02:53:30.397]  Yes, things have been done.
[02:53:31.223 --> 02:53:32.724]  We're gonna have more eyes on this election.
[02:53:32.744 --> 02:53:35.204]  There have been little pieces of legislation here and there.
[02:53:37.165 --> 02:53:37.905]  But we shall see.
[02:53:38.526 --> 02:53:44.528]  When we come back from the break, I'm really gonna dig into this because it's necessary.
[02:53:44.568 --> 02:53:45.128]  So don't go anywhere.
[02:53:45.168 --> 02:53:45.788]  Share all the links.
[02:53:46.469 --> 02:53:47.829]  All right, InfoWarriors, we are back.
[02:53:47.849 --> 02:53:51.451]  You are now watching the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:53:51.471 --> 02:53:54.972]  I am your guest host, Drew Hernandez.
[02:53:55.972 --> 02:54:13.025]   Now, it's interesting, as I was saying before the break, It's interesting to me that Republicans wait four to five months out before pushing the SAVE Act, knowing damn well that the Senate is gonna shut it down.
[02:54:13.365 --> 02:54:17.629]  And if it somehow passes in the Senate, that Biden's gonna veto it, it's dead.
[02:54:20.171 --> 02:54:23.874]  I personally believe that it's political theater.
[02:54:25.375 --> 02:54:30.499]  Politicians just want something to get people all rallied up and unified.
[02:54:31.272 --> 02:54:40.400]  around and worked up to have a common goal and a common enemy to point at.
[02:54:40.420 --> 02:54:43.683]  And obviously, these rhinos and these retards, they know this.
[02:54:44.423 --> 02:54:45.364]  They damn well know this.
[02:54:46.105 --> 02:54:48.047]  And I'm just gonna say it publicly, it's useless.
[02:54:48.087 --> 02:54:49.748]  The SAVE Act means nothing right now.
[02:54:50.349 --> 02:54:50.829]  It means nothing.
[02:54:51.349 --> 02:54:52.370]  It's DOA in the Senate.
[02:54:53.031 --> 02:54:54.272]  MTG told you this yesterday.
[02:54:54.292 --> 02:55:09.711]   And my question is, why was this done four to five months out before One of the most important, imperative, future determining elections in America, okay?
[02:55:09.831 --> 02:55:12.653]  In American, arguably, world history.
[02:55:13.674 --> 02:55:14.275]  So there's that.
[02:55:15.236 --> 02:55:29.065]   And then you see Gretchen Whitmer and those developments yesterday, with that piece of legislation that is gonna make it extremely hard, borderline illegal, to actually Call for a recount or investigate for fraud in Michigan.
[02:55:29.706 --> 02:55:32.028]  That developed last night in Wisconsin as well.
[02:55:33.509 --> 02:55:40.195]  The Wisconsin Supreme Court just swept away like it was nothing, swept away like it was nothing.
[02:55:40.695 --> 02:55:52.525]  Legislation that made it harder to use more ballot drop boxes in this upcoming election.
[02:55:53.812 --> 02:55:58.333]  And then at the same time, obviously nothing is being done about the machines, so we gotta beat that.
[02:55:59.234 --> 02:56:01.514]  And then at the same time, we have millions.
[02:56:02.794 --> 02:56:08.136]  Okay, I think it was Greg Reese last night, right?
[02:56:08.196 --> 02:56:15.218]  I don't know when this was put out, but I saw Greg Reese's report of these illegals getting Social Security numbers.
[02:56:16.471 --> 02:56:25.095]  And the number of illegals potentially voting in this upcoming election will be around, I think it was 20 to 30 million, if I have this right?
[02:56:25.115 --> 02:56:27.156]  20 to 30 million in this 2024 election.
[02:56:27.776 --> 02:56:34.279]  So my question is, is the too big to rig theory mathematically even possible?
[02:56:36.040 --> 02:56:43.923]  With 30 million illegals, potentially, let's just be conservative about that and say 15 million, okay?
[02:56:46.539 --> 02:56:51.422]  Are gonna be added to whoever the hell Democrats go with in November.
[02:56:53.463 --> 02:56:57.985]  I mean, if you think about how these rigors work, is they do it in pockets.
[02:56:59.286 --> 02:57:02.908]  And they will do it and they'll deploy, I don't know, maybe 10,000.
[02:57:03.508 --> 02:57:10.392]  Let's say 10,000 illegals to vote in a swing state will spread them out.
[02:57:11.007 --> 02:57:15.729]  Throughout different precincts, so it doesn't look like mass voter fraud.
[02:57:16.109 --> 02:57:19.970]  This is why they run around the news saying that there is no evidence of mass voter fraud.
[02:57:20.010 --> 02:57:22.751]  They just need to very strategically.
[02:57:24.752 --> 02:57:29.373]  Calculate where they need to send pockets of, I don't know, 500 there, 200 there.
[02:57:31.790 --> 02:57:33.732]  Several different precincts in different swing states.
[02:57:33.772 --> 02:57:35.693]  Yes, there are more eyes on this election.
[02:57:36.134 --> 02:57:38.095]  Yes, we got Laura Trump in the RNC.
[02:57:38.496 --> 02:57:40.217]  Yes, we have more ballot chasers.
[02:57:40.617 --> 02:57:43.019]  Yes, we have more volunteers, as you should.
[02:57:43.079 --> 02:57:47.763]  There should be millions of Americans right now holding the line, okay?
[02:57:48.924 --> 02:57:53.648]  Volunteering at the polls to watch this upcoming election.
[02:57:54.688 --> 02:57:57.130]  The question is, is will it be enough?
[02:57:58.411 --> 02:58:00.133]  The question is, is will it be enough?
[02:58:00.729 --> 02:58:12.775]  And I, as an American, not just a Trump supporter, not just someone that is pro-America first, not just as a Christian, just as a spectator, right?
[02:58:13.135 --> 02:58:29.624]  If you remove yourself from the situation, and you are just watching this, and you're watching both sides, and you're watching the unit party fully operate, and you're watching the direction things are going in, I just conclude that they're gonna obviously attempt to rig this damn thing.
[02:58:30.239 --> 02:58:40.026]  There's anybody out there that doesn't believe that Democrats deep state in the unit party right now are plotting and preparing to steal this upcoming election.
[02:58:40.267 --> 02:58:45.250]  You're delusional, or you're just retarded and you can't comprehend reality, right?
[02:58:46.832 --> 02:58:48.933]  The question is, is will they be successful?
[02:58:48.993 --> 02:58:54.618]  And the question is, is will anything even be done when they are caught?
[02:58:54.638 --> 02:58:57.180]  Because they were caught in 2020.
[02:58:57.900 --> 02:58:58.781]  And look where that led us.
[02:59:00.157 --> 02:59:17.566]  Hack Republicans and Rhino Republicans unified with Democrats, accusing Trump and every single one of us of being threats to democracy, questioning our elections, casting doubts on the election results.
[02:59:19.167 --> 02:59:20.328]  Are we just gonna get a repeat of 2024?
[02:59:21.886 --> 02:59:25.228]  I mean, these are questions that I haven't really heard answered for the past four years.
[02:59:25.808 --> 02:59:27.229]  All I heard was the elections.
[02:59:27.590 --> 02:59:33.153]  All I heard 2021 to like half of 2022, just before Trump announced he was running.
[02:59:33.333 --> 02:59:35.874]  All I heard was 2020 was rigged.
[02:59:36.435 --> 02:59:38.056]  2020 was stolen.
[02:59:38.076 --> 02:59:39.176]  2020 was not authentic.
[02:59:39.477 --> 02:59:40.637]  Joe Biden was installed.
[02:59:40.958 --> 02:59:43.819]  And then Trump announces and then all of a sudden it's too big to rig.
[02:59:44.820 --> 02:59:45.780]  So I don't know.
[02:59:46.161 --> 02:59:47.842]  I don't know what to tell people at this point.
[02:59:48.862 --> 02:59:54.744]   Like, the only thing I could say is Yes, I agree it's going to require a miracle.
[02:59:56.005 --> 02:59:58.326]  I agree it's going to require divine intervention.
[02:59:58.346 --> 03:00:02.509]  I agree if our strategy is to beat the riggers.
[03:00:04.110 --> 03:00:23.340]   Yeah, I guess just say a prayer, cross your fingers, and hope that we can outnumber not just Democrats, But the machines and the mail-in ballots and the millions of illegals that they are activating to vote in this next election.
[03:00:24.602 --> 03:00:27.044]  Mathematically, do we outnumber that?
[03:00:28.610 --> 03:00:29.451]  I'm just asking.
[03:00:29.731 --> 03:00:31.892]  I'm just asking, man, you know.
[03:00:32.292 --> 03:00:33.313]  I'm just a dude.
[03:00:33.893 --> 03:00:40.297]  I'm just a dude with a microphone and a camera and an internet connection asking questions, man.
[03:00:40.838 --> 03:00:41.258]  All right?
[03:00:41.538 --> 03:00:45.000]  And I know millions of people out there are asking the very same questions.
[03:00:46.061 --> 03:00:48.142]  But there's a lot of people even within Khan Inc.
[03:00:48.923 --> 03:00:51.244]  that are unwilling to ask these questions.
[03:00:52.285 --> 03:00:53.025]  And you see it, too.
[03:00:53.285 --> 03:00:53.966]  You'll see it on X.
[03:00:54.517 --> 03:01:05.862]  It's interesting, a lot of these giant conning accounts all of a sudden start freaking out because Democrats start making some serious moves to rig the election in just four to five months.
[03:01:05.882 --> 03:01:07.183]  It's like, no, really, dude?
[03:01:07.503 --> 03:01:09.184]  Wow, are you surprised by that?
[03:01:11.745 --> 03:01:17.688]  And then when the news was announced yesterday, I saw all of these people, all of these retards up and down the news, man.
[03:01:17.708 --> 03:01:22.710]  Like, look, see, now we have it on record that the Democrats want illegals to vote.
[03:01:22.730 --> 03:01:23.591]  We already know that!
[03:01:24.770 --> 03:01:26.571]  We know that, it's already on record.
[03:01:26.851 --> 03:01:36.555]  Alex Jones just played you a series of clips of even Barack Obama making it very clear that illegals should be voting in our elections.
[03:01:38.636 --> 03:01:40.297]  It's just, you know what it is?
[03:01:40.577 --> 03:01:52.083]  And if I'm completely honest with you guys, I think people like that, there's gotta be people like that that are simply just delusional.
[03:01:52.203 --> 03:01:52.963]  They're just delusional.
[03:01:53.894 --> 03:01:55.615]  They're delusional because they're retarded.
[03:01:56.315 --> 03:01:57.135]  That's it, right?
[03:01:58.256 --> 03:01:59.216]  That's one group of people.
[03:02:00.297 --> 03:02:03.638]  And then there's another group of people that are cowards.
[03:02:04.799 --> 03:02:06.980]  And they're unwilling, they're passive, right?
[03:02:07.020 --> 03:02:08.100]  You got people that are delusional.
[03:02:08.120 --> 03:02:15.503]  They're just like, we're gonna win even though we're not really doing much to secure our elections.
[03:02:15.924 --> 03:02:18.085]  You got retards out there, right?
[03:02:20.966 --> 03:02:23.187]  And then you got another group of people that are just cowards.
[03:02:23.933 --> 03:02:24.493]  They're cowards.
[03:02:25.854 --> 03:02:29.617]  They're afraid of getting cancelled by right-wing media.
[03:02:29.677 --> 03:02:33.500]  They're afraid of getting cancelled by, you know, Con Ink.
[03:02:34.321 --> 03:02:36.642]  They're afraid of being shunned, right?
[03:02:36.662 --> 03:02:42.907]  You got people out there that are cowards, and you got people out there that are passive.
[03:02:43.027 --> 03:02:44.688]  I can't stand passive people.
[03:02:45.189 --> 03:02:47.070]  Passive people are the worst.
[03:02:47.931 --> 03:02:50.753]  Passive people need to get the hell out of the way, honestly.
[03:02:51.553 --> 03:02:55.116]  Passive people don't deserve an opinion on anything, okay?
[03:02:56.097 --> 03:02:57.819]  Yeah, you got free speech, but you know what, dude?
[03:02:57.859 --> 03:02:58.499]  Shut the hell up.
[03:02:58.539 --> 03:02:59.720]  We don't want to hear you, okay?
[03:03:00.221 --> 03:03:03.023]  Because you're not willing to do anything, okay?
[03:03:04.064 --> 03:03:12.621]   So what you have is you have Cowards and passive people that will just run around and say, well, too big to rig, too big to rig.
[03:03:14.822 --> 03:03:17.423]  We see the writing on the wall, but too big to rig.
[03:03:17.943 --> 03:03:26.627]  Cross your fingers and just close your eyes and say MAGA, MAGA, MAGA three times and Donald Trump will appear and be our winner.
[03:03:30.189 --> 03:03:32.630]  Listen, you know people like this, all right?
[03:03:34.252 --> 03:03:39.314]  And then I think you have people that are just controlled opposition, like these rhinos and people within Khan Inc.
[03:03:39.974 --> 03:03:48.958]  that just regurgitate these talking points and they keep MAGA and they keep the movement in like a state of hypnosis, thinking everything's going to be okay.
[03:03:52.059 --> 03:03:53.440]  And let me make myself clear.
[03:03:54.040 --> 03:03:54.981]  Let me make myself clear.
[03:03:57.422 --> 03:04:11.918]   If there's anything that I've ever been wrong about, I pray And I seriously, seriously pray and I beg God that I'm wrong about this.
[03:04:13.578 --> 03:04:16.520]  That they are going to steal this upcoming election in November.
[03:04:17.960 --> 03:04:21.161]  And they are not going to let Trump anywhere near that White House.
[03:04:22.402 --> 03:04:29.004]  Even if it's abundantly clear that he won the electoral college, popular vote, everything, right?
[03:04:30.105 --> 03:04:33.346]  I pray and I hope this is not something that I want to be right about.
[03:04:38.146 --> 03:04:40.407]  Because I think we're going to lose the Republic at this point.
[03:04:40.427 --> 03:04:50.433]  It's like if they steal this next upcoming election, expect stolen elections probably for the next 50 years.
[03:04:51.874 --> 03:04:55.637]  Conservatively, if I'm completely honest with you.
[03:04:56.717 --> 03:04:58.218]  Yes, we need divine intervention.
[03:04:58.558 --> 03:05:00.520]  Yes, we have our hope in God.
[03:05:00.820 --> 03:05:02.801]  Yes, my trust and my faith is in God.
[03:05:03.942 --> 03:05:10.444]  But that doesn't mean we just sit around, cross our fingers, and hope this thing just works itself out.
[03:05:11.084 --> 03:05:12.605]  No, we gotta hold people accountable.
[03:05:13.245 --> 03:05:14.825]  We gotta hold Republicans accountable.
[03:05:15.746 --> 03:05:16.806]  They've been sitting on their hands.
[03:05:17.066 --> 03:05:24.648]  Republicans have been more concerned with making sure that we're sending billions of dollars to Israel for the past four years, and Ukraine.
[03:05:26.489 --> 03:05:41.863]   Instead of securing our southern border and our elections, But no, we get the SAVE Act five months before one of the most critical life or death determining elections of American history.
[03:05:42.243 --> 03:05:43.124]  Yeah, I don't like that.
[03:05:44.405 --> 03:05:44.945]  I don't like that.
[03:05:44.965 --> 03:05:45.726]  I don't know about you.
[03:05:45.746 --> 03:05:46.566]  I don't like that.
[03:05:46.786 --> 03:05:47.507]  That's not enough.
[03:05:48.308 --> 03:05:48.948]  Not enough for me.
[03:05:50.049 --> 03:05:51.070]  Should have been done years ago.
[03:05:52.931 --> 03:05:54.953]  But I personally believe they know.
[03:05:55.672 --> 03:05:56.533]  It's going to get shot down.
[03:05:56.593 --> 03:06:05.439]  I think they know that they're going to rig it, and they just need something to continue to get everyone within the right wing all riled up, have a common enemy.
[03:06:05.479 --> 03:06:06.340]  It's the same thing.
[03:06:06.860 --> 03:06:07.741]  You know what the equivalent?
[03:06:08.021 --> 03:06:16.067]  The Republicans do the same thing to conservatives and their constituents and Republican voters.
[03:06:16.728 --> 03:06:18.809]  They do the same thing Democrats do to blacks.
[03:06:21.031 --> 03:06:23.313]  They're always riling all the blacks up.
[03:06:24.654 --> 03:06:26.115]  Oh, here's the problem.
[03:06:26.435 --> 03:06:31.680]  We are the solution, and part of the problem are Republicans.
[03:06:31.720 --> 03:06:36.905]  So vote for us, and we're gonna get this thing all taken care of, right?
[03:06:37.986 --> 03:06:40.988]  Republicans do the same damn thing to conservatives, dude.
[03:06:41.369 --> 03:06:41.849]  Same thing.
[03:06:42.690 --> 03:06:44.912]  Remember when Trump was running around in 2016, based 2016 Trump?
[03:06:48.379 --> 03:06:50.099]  I was pushing for Muslim bans.
[03:06:51.300 --> 03:06:52.140]  You remember those days?
[03:06:52.160 --> 03:06:52.940]  Remember those days?
[03:06:52.980 --> 03:06:55.380]  Now we got Trump disavowing Project 2025.
[03:06:55.840 --> 03:07:04.582]  Yeah, but you remember when Trump was running around saying these politicians are all talking no action?
[03:07:04.802 --> 03:07:06.542]  Yeah, Trump was right.
[03:07:06.582 --> 03:07:12.023]  Remember when Trump was exposing and unmasking the Republican Party in those primaries in 2016?
[03:07:14.624 --> 03:07:15.744]  That's still happening today.
[03:07:16.661 --> 03:07:22.526]  Why do you think, did you guys watch Trump's rally in Doral, Florida, Miami?
[03:07:23.728 --> 03:07:25.669]  See when Marco Rubio went up, did you see that?
[03:07:26.550 --> 03:07:29.052]  Did you see how inauthentic that was?
[03:07:29.573 --> 03:07:35.839]  And I saw people within MAGA, I saw cuz we stream the show on my own show on Rumble.
[03:07:35.859 --> 03:07:39.182]  And by the way, you can go follow me over there, rumble.com slash Drew Hernandez.
[03:07:40.081 --> 03:07:43.263]  I host my show Drew Hernandez Live Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[03:07:43.303 --> 03:07:44.123]  Pacific, 9 p.m.
[03:07:44.203 --> 03:07:44.544]  Eastern.
[03:07:45.004 --> 03:07:46.825]  It's like late night Info Wars.
[03:07:47.185 --> 03:07:47.665]  You'll like it.
[03:07:47.725 --> 03:07:48.086]  Check it out.
[03:07:48.226 --> 03:07:49.506]  Follow me on X2 at Drew H. Live.
[03:07:51.247 --> 03:07:56.450]  But I was seeing all kinds of people in the comments like, oh, Marco's just nervous.
[03:07:57.411 --> 03:07:58.111]  He's nervous.
[03:07:58.131 --> 03:08:01.953]  He's just not as charismatic as, you know, people we're used to.
[03:08:01.993 --> 03:08:06.196]  I'm like, I don't know, man, because I remember, I remember little Marco.
[03:08:07.236 --> 03:08:11.599]  I remember, and little Marco doesn't have the excuse to say, well, he's getting older.
[03:08:11.619 --> 03:08:12.399]  No, no, no, no.
[03:08:12.499 --> 03:08:16.502]  I remember little Marco in the 2016 Republican primaries.
[03:08:17.202 --> 03:08:17.882]  He was sharp.
[03:08:18.703 --> 03:08:22.605]  He was on it, attacking Trump.
[03:08:24.186 --> 03:08:26.567]  I remember these things, so I don't buy that.
[03:08:27.088 --> 03:08:31.230]  You want to know why Marco Rubio looks so out of place on that stage?
[03:08:31.951 --> 03:08:32.671]  He's a rhino.
[03:08:33.492 --> 03:08:34.172]  Establishment.
[03:08:35.555 --> 03:08:42.257]  They not like us, to quote the great philosopher of the 21st century, Kendrick Lamar, right?
[03:08:42.337 --> 03:08:44.338]  I mean, it's just you can identify these people.
[03:08:44.598 --> 03:08:47.319]  They stick out, so obvious.
[03:08:48.260 --> 03:08:51.201]  It was cringe, it was cringe watching Marco Rubio up there.
[03:08:51.741 --> 03:08:54.342]  I felt like I was in high school again.
[03:08:54.802 --> 03:09:00.044]  You remember high school assemblies or high school rallies?
[03:09:01.098 --> 03:09:19.067]  And like your cringe, your cringe vice-principal would come up and is like, you know, saying all of the words and using all the terminology that we're all using for that generation, trying to like cater to us and we're like, just stop, just stop, just stop!
[03:09:19.687 --> 03:09:19.967]  Right?
[03:09:20.167 --> 03:09:21.028]  That's how I felt.
[03:09:21.108 --> 03:09:21.788]  I don't know, man.
[03:09:22.128 --> 03:09:28.011]  I might be way up on that one, but when I was watching that, I'm like, nah, I'm good on that one.
[03:09:29.468 --> 03:09:55.209]  But the point is this, is I think it's very clear and abundantly clear that the Uniparty is fully operational and active and ready to push this country into a full surveillance state, globalist utopia, where every other nation is going to Israel, Ukraine, everyone, everyone.
[03:09:55.329 --> 03:09:57.531]  That's what even the CCP, the list goes on, right?
[03:09:58.550 --> 03:10:06.657]  Where every single nation is going to feast off of the carcass of the dead body of the United States of America.
[03:10:07.557 --> 03:10:09.819]  And that's the agenda of globalism.
[03:10:09.839 --> 03:10:17.366]  That's the agenda of this anti-Christ, globalist machine and spirit that the Bible speaks of.
[03:10:18.446 --> 03:10:21.549]  A republic like the United States of America can't exist.
[03:10:23.591 --> 03:10:27.294]  A republic like the USA can't be existing.
[03:10:28.940 --> 03:10:32.241]  With that type of agenda simultaneously at the same time.
[03:10:32.261 --> 03:10:34.982]  It needs to be removed because it poses a threat.
[03:10:35.963 --> 03:10:49.108]  Not simply because of the USA military power, but because of our very fundamental constitutional rights that oppose everything that they stand on and want to enact and impose on every single one of us.
[03:10:49.888 --> 03:10:50.628]  That's a fact.
[03:10:51.409 --> 03:10:52.949]  And that's happening in real time.
[03:10:53.409 --> 03:10:55.050]  Look at the globalists in NATO right now.
[03:10:55.874 --> 03:11:09.741]  Just openly, openly, you got Blinken openly on a panel in front of the whole world, just casually sitting there saying, yeah, well, as we speak, we got F-16s.
[03:11:10.941 --> 03:11:12.382]  We're sending F-16s to Ukraine.
[03:11:12.402 --> 03:11:13.222]  They'll be in the skies.
[03:11:13.823 --> 03:11:14.403]  It's gonna be great.
[03:11:14.443 --> 03:11:15.063]  It's gonna be great.
[03:11:15.323 --> 03:11:25.226]   And then you got puppet Joe Biden up there speaking in front of the NATO Summit anniversary for the 75 75th year anniversary.
[03:11:25.626 --> 03:11:29.650]  You got the puppet up there just casually talking about unifying NATO.
[03:11:29.850 --> 03:11:30.711]  Did you guys catch?
[03:11:30.731 --> 03:11:54.717]   I don't know if you guys watched it, but when I'm listening to Joe Biden, I'm just like, okay, you got this walking, speaking dead corpse, speaking, struggling to Read off of the teleprompter, but at the same time, I'm also trying to listen to what the handlers are attempting to have him to read, cuz it's important.
[03:11:55.358 --> 03:12:00.541]  I don't know if you guys caught Biden's speech the other day, but it was interesting the way that it was worded.
[03:12:01.261 --> 03:12:06.204]  As if a lot of people say, well, you're exaggerating saying World War III, World War III.
[03:12:06.264 --> 03:12:08.365]  No, no, no, no, no, these people talk this way.
[03:12:09.245 --> 03:12:26.347]   In Joe Biden's speech, He was literally taking us down the path saying, today it's like how it was where we have Europe is out of control and is about to be dominated right now.
[03:12:26.367 --> 03:12:30.549]  It's like, okay, yeah, so we saw that in World War II, right?
[03:12:30.609 --> 03:12:32.470]  Making the comparison to what now?
[03:12:33.191 --> 03:12:34.411]  World War III, right?
[03:12:35.111 --> 03:12:44.132]   And then Biden said, and Like Europe once had dictators on the rise and posing a threat.
[03:12:45.633 --> 03:12:46.674]  We have Putin today.
[03:12:46.694 --> 03:12:50.516]  Okay, so they're comparing World War II to now.
[03:12:51.016 --> 03:12:53.018]  So we're in World War III now, right?
[03:12:53.658 --> 03:12:56.780]  And so when you see this, it's not a stretch, right?
[03:12:56.820 --> 03:13:06.666]  It's not a stretch to say that these people are literally not only wanting, but leading us in to a full-scale World War III scenario.
[03:13:08.664 --> 03:13:15.868]  Similarly to what we saw the World War II and World War I. That's how they talk, right?
[03:13:15.908 --> 03:13:16.649]  That's what they want.
[03:13:16.689 --> 03:13:17.989]  And what came out of World War II?
[03:13:18.570 --> 03:13:20.051]  They're proud of this.
[03:13:20.171 --> 03:13:23.572]  NATO, the United Nations, globalism, right?
[03:13:26.734 --> 03:13:35.719]  And the State of Israel that they use to manipulate everyone in every single nation that disagrees with them by just calling them an anti-Semite and shutting them down.
[03:13:36.932 --> 03:13:39.213]  Why do you think they want another World War 3 scenario?
[03:13:39.273 --> 03:13:41.595]  Because the outcome of that will be what?
[03:13:42.235 --> 03:13:44.617]  A new world order.
[03:13:45.317 --> 03:13:46.238]  They always talk about this.
[03:13:46.338 --> 03:13:58.385]  Even when you listen to the World Economic Forum summits at Davos or the World Government Summit, any of these, they always talk about World War 2.
[03:13:59.306 --> 03:14:13.229]  Post-World War II, after the Nazis were defeated, we established the United Nations in a global unification to make sure that we will never see a dictator ever again.
[03:14:13.269 --> 03:14:16.670]  We had global unification, the United Nations.
[03:14:17.150 --> 03:14:18.090]  This is how they talk, right?
[03:14:18.110 --> 03:14:19.070]  Like it's a good thing.
[03:14:21.071 --> 03:14:23.071]  And they call it a new world order.
[03:14:23.914 --> 03:14:33.303]  The establishment of the United Nations and the establishment of NATO post-World War II, they all attribute that to a new world order.
[03:14:33.603 --> 03:14:34.824]  And they want another one.
[03:14:35.005 --> 03:14:36.866]  They want a Great Reset.
[03:14:37.767 --> 03:14:40.189]  And this is only going to happen with a World War III scenario.
[03:14:40.229 --> 03:14:41.150]  They need this.
[03:14:43.493 --> 03:14:44.153]  They need this.
[03:14:44.554 --> 03:14:54.295]   And Blinken made it very clear that They will increase Ukraine's air defense via F-16s.
[03:14:55.256 --> 03:14:56.677]  Biden's sending another today.
[03:14:56.697 --> 03:14:57.378]  Was it today?
[03:14:57.438 --> 03:14:59.260]  He was on stage with Zelensky.
[03:14:59.300 --> 03:15:03.684]  More billions of dollars continuing to increase their military power.
[03:15:04.685 --> 03:15:16.252]   Blinken made it very clear that this summer, Ukraine Is going to further and expand their military efforts, including F-16s.
[03:15:16.292 --> 03:15:18.273]  I mean, what they're doing is they're increasing.
[03:15:18.313 --> 03:15:22.535]  We might very well see possibly World War III before this election.
[03:15:22.875 --> 03:15:24.656]  That might shut down the upcoming election.
[03:15:26.637 --> 03:15:32.380]  There's a lot of scenarios that I think could potentially happen in the next few months, but there's one that really has my attention.
[03:15:33.100 --> 03:15:36.842]  And I really want to focus and zero in on this because I've been talking about this for months.
[03:15:37.282 --> 03:15:39.163]  And honestly, I thought I was kind of crazy.
[03:15:40.034 --> 03:15:41.395]  You guys listen to me on my show.
[03:15:41.435 --> 03:15:43.715]  I think I've mentioned this here on the Alex Jones Show a few times.
[03:15:45.116 --> 03:15:51.678]  But now that I'm seeing these articles pop out out of nowhere last night, I'm like, okay, well, maybe I'm not crazy.
[03:15:52.439 --> 03:15:59.882]  Because the scenario that I've been thinking about for probably the past two years seems to possibly be on the horizon.
[03:16:00.222 --> 03:16:01.182]  But we shall see.
[03:16:02.022 --> 03:16:02.563]  We shall see.
[03:16:02.583 --> 03:16:07.108]   But one thing I do know, Is that they are going to attempt to steal this damn thing.
[03:16:07.388 --> 03:16:11.850]  It is abundantly clear they are going to attempt to steal this thing.
[03:16:12.190 --> 03:16:19.313]  This is exactly why they are importing millions of illegals in this country for the past four years.
[03:16:19.673 --> 03:16:33.163]   If you cannot mathematically add that up as to why, well then you're just simply naive, not paying attention, delusional, Or just straight up in denial.
[03:16:33.283 --> 03:16:35.972]  I'll talk about this scenario when we come back from the other side.
[03:16:36.373 --> 03:16:37.195]  So meet me over there.
[03:16:37.256 --> 03:16:37.837]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:16:37.858 --> 03:16:38.459]  We'll be right back.

[03:18:25.911 --> 03:18:40.061]   So for the past maybe year and a half, a couple of years, I've been asking myself this question is, OK, if the too big to rig theory ends up being correct, Let's just say we get a miracle, because that's what it's going to require.
[03:18:40.641 --> 03:18:40.981]  All right.
[03:18:41.922 --> 03:18:49.746]  And I think Trump 100%, no matter who he's matched up against, W. Democrats are so unpopular right now.
[03:18:50.586 --> 03:18:51.987]  They have done a horrible job.
[03:18:52.187 --> 03:18:53.167]  Everybody hates them.
[03:18:54.288 --> 03:19:00.391]  Because everyone now knows they're the reason why this country is a sinking ship.
[03:19:00.971 --> 03:19:02.012]  Literally, quite literally.
[03:19:02.032 --> 03:19:06.864]   From the economy to the border, Foreign policy, the list goes on, right?
[03:19:07.245 --> 03:19:13.508]  Crime, everywhere you look, you can see just exactly who is responsible.
[03:19:14.068 --> 03:19:27.475]  And it's ridiculous how they have Joe Biden on the debate stage or anywhere and they try to blame Trump for a terrible economy while at the same time they try to take credit saying the economy is actually doing really well.
[03:19:28.596 --> 03:19:31.137]  See, people are starting to see through this, but okay.
[03:19:32.572 --> 03:19:41.839]  Regardless of who they put up against Trump in a free and fair election scenario, I think Trump destroys Democrats for obvious reasons, right?
[03:19:41.859 --> 03:19:46.622]  I think that's fair to say in a free and fair scenario.
[03:19:47.583 --> 03:19:51.906]  However, and I don't think for this to happen, it doesn't matter who's in the White House.
[03:19:52.747 --> 03:20:05.983]   Whether they stick with Joe and Kamala or they go with Big Mike and Kamala or Kamala, Newsome, whoever, they will put a psychopath that is loyal to Lucifer.
[03:20:06.344 --> 03:20:07.744]  That's like the requirement, right?
[03:20:08.885 --> 03:20:09.545]  What happens?
[03:20:10.606 --> 03:20:13.707]  November goes by and Trump wins.
[03:20:15.428 --> 03:20:17.229]  What happens if it is a red wave?
[03:20:17.309 --> 03:20:23.852]  What happens if it is just a total electoral college blowout, popular vote blowout?
[03:20:24.807 --> 03:20:31.689]  And Trump just destroys Democrats and it is abundantly clear that that's the case, right?
[03:20:32.610 --> 03:20:38.052]  No matter what they try, no matter what they say, let's say we beat the riggers, right?
[03:20:38.412 --> 03:20:40.413]  That's essentially what's happening right now.
[03:20:40.493 --> 03:20:50.016]  It's like us and Trump, not versus Democrats, it's us and Trump versus the Democrats and the illegals and the riggers, right?
[03:20:51.599 --> 03:20:52.159]  Are we enough?
[03:20:52.400 --> 03:20:52.820]  We'll see.
[03:20:52.880 --> 03:20:54.523]  But let's say we are, right?
[03:20:54.543 --> 03:20:55.344]  Let's say we are.
[03:20:55.364 --> 03:21:03.756]  Do you guys remember what Democrats were saying before the 2020 election, before they stole it?
[03:21:04.737 --> 03:21:06.139]  Remember the projection we were hearing?
[03:21:06.159 --> 03:21:11.735]   Remember they were saying that It's possible that Trump may not leave the White House.
[03:21:12.255 --> 03:21:17.016]  It's possible that we might have to deploy the military because we're going to have a constitutional crisis.
[03:21:17.276 --> 03:21:21.858]  And Trump is an authoritarian and he will refuse to leave the White House.
[03:21:21.878 --> 03:21:22.698]  You guys remember that?
[03:21:22.957 --> 03:21:28.477]   And remember, everything that they say we are, or everything that they say we will do,
[03:21:28.477 --> 03:21:36.876]   or everything that they accuse us of is, accuse us of is, is what they are.
[03:21:36.876 --> 03:21:43.037]  Is what they are doing, or is what they will do.
[03:21:43.203 --> 03:21:44.203]  Is that not clear yet?
[03:21:44.824 --> 03:21:45.824]  I think that's pretty clear.
[03:21:45.864 --> 03:21:47.444]  That's not a hot take, right?
[03:21:47.784 --> 03:21:49.205]  We know this, we know this by now.
[03:21:50.905 --> 03:22:00.948]  And we know that they are the ones that claimed that Russia colluded with Trump or Trump colluded with Russia in the 2016 election.
[03:22:03.115 --> 03:22:06.237]  And that those results were invalid and not real.
[03:22:06.257 --> 03:22:08.518]  And they were calling to abolish the Electoral College.
[03:22:09.219 --> 03:22:11.540]  They were calling for delegates to withhold their delegates.
[03:22:11.741 --> 03:22:20.906]  They were calling to put a stop because they were saying that the 2016 election results were not real or authentic.
[03:22:21.006 --> 03:22:21.987]  And that's been proven what?
[03:22:22.287 --> 03:22:22.928]  To be untrue.
[03:22:25.049 --> 03:22:31.393]  Now, one thing that I've noticed for the past, let's eight years, nearly 10 years with Trump.
[03:22:32.102 --> 03:22:34.403]  Fully activated in American politics, right?
[03:22:34.863 --> 03:22:44.168]  One thing that I've noticed is yes, that everything that they are and they are gonna do or are doing, they blame on us.
[03:22:45.568 --> 03:22:47.169]  They blame on, they say we're doing, right?
[03:22:48.029 --> 03:22:53.412]  But at the same time, they've gotten so bipolar with their lies, right?
[03:22:54.998 --> 03:23:00.423]  At first, they go with one lie, and they'll switch it up in six months.
[03:23:00.463 --> 03:23:06.349]  And then there's a new lie, and then there's a new talking point, and then they'll move on from that.
[03:23:06.409 --> 03:23:13.115]  But have you guys noticed ever since Biden was installed, they are literally just all over the place.
[03:23:13.496 --> 03:23:19.141]  They are so back and forth, but they're not even trying to hide it anymore.
[03:23:20.316 --> 03:23:26.424]  Like, one day they're saying the election is rigged, and then literally, not even a day later, hours later, they're saying, oh, well, no, it's not.
[03:23:26.464 --> 03:23:27.465]  It's actually Republicans.
[03:23:29.027 --> 03:23:29.228]  Right?
[03:23:29.248 --> 03:23:33.253]  Like, they've gotten so, I think, arrogant to where they don't give a damn.
[03:23:34.045 --> 03:23:40.048]  This is why like when you listen to a lot of like conservative content and all the content is is like, she look at their hypocrites.
[03:23:40.068 --> 03:23:40.728]  They don't care.
[03:23:40.788 --> 03:23:42.129]  They know they know they're hypocrites.
[03:23:42.149 --> 03:23:42.909]  They don't give a damn.
[03:23:43.050 --> 03:23:43.550]  They're like F you.
[03:23:43.570 --> 03:23:44.530]  What are you going to do about it?
[03:23:44.710 --> 03:23:45.671]  We know we're hypocrites.
[03:23:46.211 --> 03:23:54.375]  We know what we said yesterday, but now we're saying this and then we'll say the same thing again tomorrow and then we'll change it again because it's rules for rules for the but not for me.
[03:23:54.395 --> 03:23:56.036]  You're a peasant.
[03:23:56.656 --> 03:23:57.237]  We're the boss.
[03:23:57.537 --> 03:23:58.137]  We're the king.
[03:23:58.377 --> 03:24:00.758]  We say whatever the hell goes, right?
[03:24:01.038 --> 03:24:04.385]   They they're just it's just They don't even try to hide it anymore.
[03:24:07.927 --> 03:24:18.692]  And so what I'm getting to is, if Trump legitimately wins this thing, and this is a possible scenario, I'm not saying, thus says the Lord, God showed me this is what's going to happen.
[03:24:18.732 --> 03:24:20.793]  I'm just saying, let's think about it.
[03:24:21.273 --> 03:24:24.135]  Because I kind of want to know what happens in this scenario.
[03:24:25.416 --> 03:24:26.716]  Let's say it's too big to rig.
[03:24:26.756 --> 03:24:28.057]  Let's say Trump wins this thing.
[03:24:31.098 --> 03:24:32.899]  Are Democrats going to certify the election?
[03:24:32.939 --> 03:24:38.161]  And then already people are going to say, well, because they thought Mike Pence wasn't going to do it.
[03:24:38.661 --> 03:24:41.562]  They made it law that the Vice President, they have to do it.
[03:24:41.722 --> 03:24:43.923]  The election is set in stone.
[03:24:43.943 --> 03:24:44.683]  That's it.
[03:24:44.743 --> 03:24:47.564]  Yeah, because Democrats follow laws.
[03:24:47.584 --> 03:24:54.106]  Because Democrats, they play by the rules, right?
[03:24:54.407 --> 03:24:55.787]  Yeah, they play by the rules.
[03:24:55.827 --> 03:24:56.527]  Give me a break.
[03:24:57.388 --> 03:24:57.988]  Give me a break.
[03:24:58.658 --> 03:25:00.980]  These people have a God complex.
[03:25:01.960 --> 03:25:05.203]  In their mind, they are the authors of the universe.
[03:25:05.743 --> 03:25:08.145]  They are the authors of life.
[03:25:08.685 --> 03:25:11.867]  In their minds, they are reality.
[03:25:12.028 --> 03:25:13.409]  They're not the author of reality.
[03:25:13.609 --> 03:25:15.770]  They are reality to you in their minds.
[03:25:16.050 --> 03:25:19.073]  Own nothing, be happy, eat bugs, do whatever the hell we tell you to do.
[03:25:19.633 --> 03:25:20.794]  Eat whatever we tell you to eat.
[03:25:21.294 --> 03:25:22.715]  Believe anything we tell you to believe.
[03:25:23.236 --> 03:25:24.597]  Watch anything we tell you to watch.
[03:25:25.037 --> 03:25:26.558]  Listen to everything we tell you to listen.
[03:25:27.685 --> 03:25:30.627]  And don't you ever have another opinion unless we approved it.
[03:25:31.908 --> 03:25:36.571]  Yeah, that's who you're saying is gonna follow the rules and certify the election?
[03:25:36.651 --> 03:25:37.752]  Okay, set that aside.
[03:25:39.793 --> 03:25:41.294]  Are Democrats gonna leave the White House?
[03:25:43.635 --> 03:25:52.341]  Because Alex always talks about, what is it, the 79, 75 days of hell between Election Day and Inauguration Day, right?
[03:25:53.962 --> 03:25:56.424]  Is there gonna be a peaceful transfer of power?
[03:25:57.879 --> 03:26:00.460]  A peaceful, respectful transfer of power.
[03:26:00.640 --> 03:26:05.981]  If Trump wins this thing, are Democrats just gonna let go?
[03:26:06.001 --> 03:26:09.142]  And we know what they're gonna do.
[03:26:09.162 --> 03:26:10.022]  They'll do the same thing.
[03:26:10.142 --> 03:26:11.722]  If they actually do, they'll do the same thing.
[03:26:11.742 --> 03:26:13.263]  They're probably already spying on Trump.
[03:26:13.303 --> 03:26:16.464]  And it'll just be impeachment after impeachment after impeachment after impeachment.
[03:26:16.724 --> 03:26:23.005]  More trials, more indictments, more court cases, distracting the president from doing his job for four years.
[03:26:23.025 --> 03:26:26.566]  And then they'll blame him for a terrible job because he's in a damn courtroom.
[03:26:27.321 --> 03:26:28.642]  For most of his term, right?
[03:26:32.484 --> 03:26:33.264]  I don't see that.
[03:26:33.284 --> 03:26:37.326]  I don't know, I might be naive.
[03:26:37.346 --> 03:26:40.608]  I might be thinking too deeply.
[03:26:40.628 --> 03:26:53.955]  I don't know, but the way that this current Democrat establishment machine is, they are shouting from the rooftops.
[03:26:55.609 --> 03:27:00.210]  That Trump is literally, okay, this is what they're saying in the news, MSNBC, you see it.
[03:27:00.691 --> 03:27:09.733]  That Trump is getting ready to literally murder and kill his political opponents on the White House lawn if he so chooses to.
[03:27:09.753 --> 03:27:15.755]  And now they've even amplified that message after the Supreme Court decision.
[03:27:16.701 --> 03:27:19.363]  Giving Trump presidential immunity on official matters.
[03:27:19.703 --> 03:27:25.227]  Now they've laced that in with that, and they've said, well, Trump can now murder his political opponents.
[03:27:26.908 --> 03:27:29.350]  And he could deploy the military on all his political opponents.
[03:27:30.551 --> 03:27:40.478]  Abduct them all, enslave them all, kill them all, and just be protected by this rogue authoritarian, according to AOC, this authoritarian Supreme Court.
[03:27:40.758 --> 03:27:44.481]  He will just be protected by his presidential immunity on official matters.
[03:27:46.926 --> 03:27:50.649]  These people are claiming that this is the fall of their democracy.
[03:27:52.070 --> 03:27:56.094]  That Trump is going to be an authoritarian dictator that will destroy everybody.
[03:27:56.114 --> 03:27:57.455]  He's coming after black people.
[03:27:57.495 --> 03:27:59.476]  He's coming after brown people.
[03:27:59.516 --> 03:28:01.678]  He's coming to annihilate everybody, right?
[03:28:01.698 --> 03:28:08.324]  They are really amplifying this message of a hostile threat.
[03:28:08.364 --> 03:28:21.486]   And it kind of lines up with this propaganda for the past four years that Trump supporters And those that are a part of MAGA are MAGA Republican right-wing domestic terrorist extremists.
[03:28:23.587 --> 03:28:27.390]  I mean, January 6th gave them that official talking point.
[03:28:29.071 --> 03:28:31.973]  And to spew that and spread that across the entire world.
[03:28:32.474 --> 03:28:35.436]  And unfortunately, millions of retards out there believe it.
[03:28:36.176 --> 03:28:36.837]  Unfortunately.
[03:28:36.857 --> 03:28:42.601]  I mean, we're waking a lot of people up, but unfortunately, there's still a lot of stupid people out there that believe this stuff.
[03:28:45.137 --> 03:28:50.240]  So if Trump wins in a landslide, do Democrats leave the office?
[03:28:50.460 --> 03:28:51.580]  Do they leave the White House?
[03:28:51.840 --> 03:28:56.183]  And if they don't, then where do we go from there?
[03:28:57.803 --> 03:29:01.165]  I don't have an answer to this, because listen, and let's put that headline up.
[03:29:01.745 --> 03:29:08.309]  When I saw this last night, I had to recheck it over and over again, this Fox News article.
[03:29:08.329 --> 03:29:27.265]   And it's not just Fox, it's all over the news, where now, Intelligence agencies are now reporting that Russians are working to manipulate this upcoming election for Donald J. Trump.
[03:29:27.285 --> 03:29:30.588]  This is in the news, this is in the mainstream, this is on Fox News.
[03:29:31.449 --> 03:29:35.812]  If the team has the article, I think we have it somewhere, but I'm pretty sure you guys have seen this.
[03:29:36.755 --> 03:29:38.496]  It's going all over the news last night.
[03:29:38.536 --> 03:29:45.418]  There it is, Russia interfering in 2024 election to help Trump, US intelligence officials say.
[03:29:48.739 --> 03:29:55.041]  I think this scenario that I've been thinking about for the past couple years is possible.
[03:29:55.841 --> 03:29:58.302]  Because you want to know what catches my attention in this headline?
[03:29:58.902 --> 03:30:01.743]  Not Russia interfering in 2024 election to help Trump.
[03:30:02.364 --> 03:30:06.125]  What catches my attention is US intelligence officials say.
[03:30:07.051 --> 03:30:09.152]  Here comes the CIA.
[03:30:09.713 --> 03:30:11.674]  Here comes the FBI.
[03:30:12.174 --> 03:30:19.958]  Here they come, setting up another damn PSYOP in this upcoming 2024 election.
[03:30:21.719 --> 03:30:24.441]  Doing the groundwork, priming the nation.
[03:30:25.274 --> 03:30:32.436]  Getting everybody ready, just in case Trump gets a W. Mark my words, I've been saying this for two years.
[03:30:32.636 --> 03:30:36.817]  If Trump wins, they will resurrect the Russia collusion hoax again.
[03:30:37.577 --> 03:30:38.217]  Really, Drew?
[03:30:38.237 --> 03:30:39.357]  They're gonna go again?
[03:30:39.397 --> 03:30:40.417]  They're gonna go with that again?
[03:30:40.657 --> 03:30:43.578]  We know it's not true, but guys, they don't care.
[03:30:45.258 --> 03:30:49.279]  They've spent the last four years, they've really put their foot on the gas.
[03:30:49.779 --> 03:31:03.868]   They spent the last four years propping up Vladimir Putin as the boogeyman, Adolf Hitler 2.0 in Europe, getting ready to dominate all of Europe, like Adolf Hitler, right before World War II, right?
[03:31:05.808 --> 03:31:12.570]  They've been using Ukraine as this little pawn to get NATO together, literally poking the Russian bear.
[03:31:12.590 --> 03:31:22.393]  They've painted Vladimir Putin literally as this worldwide global threat to democracy for the past four years.
[03:31:25.780 --> 03:31:34.407]  And this is an intelligence agency psyop, I think, that they're getting ready to deploy again in the event that Trump wins in a landslide.
[03:31:34.427 --> 03:31:36.388]  I don't think they're going to leave the White House.
[03:31:36.788 --> 03:31:39.470]  They will resurrect this Russian collusion hoax.
[03:31:39.831 --> 03:31:50.699]  And it'll probably be even more effective now because millions of retards out there that believe this stuff, even more so now, are on the side of Ukraine.
[03:31:51.650 --> 03:31:57.071]  Democrats in unison will all come out and say that Donald Trump is colluding with Vladimir Putin.
[03:31:57.331 --> 03:31:59.691]  We told you that Russia is a threat.
[03:31:59.931 --> 03:32:01.672]  We told you that Putin is a threat.
[03:32:01.912 --> 03:32:06.313]  We told you that MAGA Republican extremists are a threat to our democracy.
[03:32:06.553 --> 03:32:07.413]  This is a coup.
[03:32:07.653 --> 03:32:09.513]  They're attempting to overthrow the government.
[03:32:09.713 --> 03:32:11.573]  These election results are invalid.
[03:32:11.773 --> 03:32:14.934]  The CIA, intelligence agencies said so.
[03:32:15.194 --> 03:32:16.114]  You got to believe it.
[03:32:16.334 --> 03:32:17.794]  We are not leaving the White House.
[03:32:19.035 --> 03:32:20.675]  We are not accepting these results.
[03:32:22.452 --> 03:32:26.835]  We are not going anywhere because this is a coup to overthrow our democracy.
[03:32:27.155 --> 03:32:28.616]  Trump is about to kill us all.
[03:32:28.836 --> 03:32:34.939]  He's going to literally call for the execution of all of his political opponents on the White House lawn.
[03:32:35.440 --> 03:32:44.205]  He's going to activate MAGA Republican terrorist extremists, and they're going to come after everybody and neutralize and murder all their political opponents.
[03:32:44.745 --> 03:32:46.066]  And Russia is backing them.
[03:32:47.171 --> 03:32:51.093]  Just to get Trump in the White House so he can make the call and give the order.
[03:32:51.654 --> 03:32:53.375]  We cannot stand down.
[03:32:53.595 --> 03:32:55.056]  We cannot leave the White House.
[03:32:55.536 --> 03:32:57.977]  Our democracy depends, can't you just imagine?
[03:32:58.478 --> 03:33:05.021]  Literally, I might be totally wrong and so off on this, and I hope that I am.
[03:33:05.502 --> 03:33:08.263]  Trust me, this is not something that I want to be right about.
[03:33:12.806 --> 03:33:16.188]  But they're more extreme now than they were four years ago.
[03:33:17.210 --> 03:33:21.853]  They're more extreme now than they were eight years ago, when Trump came down the escalator.
[03:33:22.214 --> 03:33:23.174]  They're worse now.
[03:33:23.735 --> 03:33:24.655]  They don't give a damn.
[03:33:25.496 --> 03:33:33.882]  They just do whatever the hell they want, because in their minds, they are literally acting like Hitler is about to take the White House.
[03:33:36.584 --> 03:33:44.490]  In their mind, and that's like this fear-mongering, this fear-porn, and they're manipulating everybody to believe this narrative.
[03:33:46.952 --> 03:33:49.174]  And in that scenario, I don't know where we go.
[03:33:49.194 --> 03:34:01.222]  And in that scenario, I think America is going to find itself in one of its most serious constitutional crisis probably since the Civil War?
[03:34:01.242 --> 03:34:05.364]  I mean, how will MAGA respond?
[03:34:06.585 --> 03:34:10.568]  Are we going to have million man MAGA marches across the entire nation?
[03:34:11.934 --> 03:34:13.715]  And then the Feds will infiltrate those.
[03:34:13.755 --> 03:34:16.195]  It'll just be like J6s everywhere.
[03:34:16.215 --> 03:34:19.816]  I am always for peaceful protest.
[03:34:19.936 --> 03:34:25.058]  But remember, Trump called on J6 to patriotically and peacefully protest.
[03:34:25.318 --> 03:34:26.338]  And look what they did with that, too.
[03:34:29.439 --> 03:34:35.140]  And then intelligence agencies will stage false flags with MAGA hats on.
[03:34:35.341 --> 03:34:40.502]  They've been talking about shutting down, attacking the power grids, attacking minorities, Jussie Smollett.
[03:34:42.071 --> 03:34:45.152]  They'll stage J6 type uprisings across the nation.
[03:34:45.192 --> 03:34:47.033]  CNN will be right there.
[03:34:47.333 --> 03:34:48.993]  See, attack on our democracy.
[03:34:49.213 --> 03:34:52.194]  The MAGA Republican right-wing extremists, they're rising.
[03:34:52.494 --> 03:34:53.935]  Look at here in Dallas.
[03:34:54.215 --> 03:34:55.755]  Look at here in Seattle.
[03:34:55.915 --> 03:34:57.276]  Look at here in Portland.
[03:34:57.456 --> 03:35:00.517]  Look here in Arizona.
[03:35:00.917 --> 03:35:03.357]  Look in Florida, across the entire nation.
[03:35:03.618 --> 03:35:07.699]  It's a worldwide MAGA Republican domestic terrorist extremist coup.
[03:35:07.759 --> 03:35:11.320]  It's a sweep, and Russia is behind it, and Trump is for it.
[03:35:11.980 --> 03:35:14.300]  He's calling for his people to take to the streets.
[03:35:15.601 --> 03:35:17.221]  Don't leave the White House, Kamala.
[03:35:17.781 --> 03:35:21.362]  Don't leave the White House, Joe, or Gavin, or Big Mike, or whoever the hell they go with.
[03:35:21.181 --> 03:35:22.181]  it doesn't matter.
[03:35:22.181 --> 03:35:29.181]  And at that point, I don't know where we go.
[03:35:29.063 --> 03:35:31.323]  I don't know.
[03:35:31.783 --> 03:35:35.264]  I've just been thinking about this for the past couple years now.
[03:35:35.344 --> 03:35:40.385]  And when I saw that headline last night, I was not shocked, but I was just like, okay.
[03:35:43.473 --> 03:35:44.774]  They may go this way.
[03:35:45.675 --> 03:35:50.379]  And listen, if Trump wins, I am convinced they will take this direction.
[03:35:50.479 --> 03:35:52.160]  I am convinced, I am convinced.
[03:35:54.022 --> 03:35:55.023]  But that's if Trump wins.
[03:35:56.244 --> 03:35:59.727]  I'm not quite too sure if he's gonna win, cuz I think they'll just steal it.
[03:36:00.828 --> 03:36:04.091]  But I think it's abundantly clear their rhetoric is on point.
[03:36:06.192 --> 03:36:07.774]  Their propaganda is on point.
[03:36:09.452 --> 03:36:11.253]  It's all in unison.
[03:36:11.333 --> 03:36:12.353]  It's all in line.
[03:36:12.753 --> 03:36:15.334]  The media is all ready for it, right?
[03:36:15.574 --> 03:36:17.034]  Cuz they're all focused on Joe right now.
[03:36:18.314 --> 03:36:23.456]  But it's for normies out there, especially if you're finding us on X and you're like, wow, this is interesting.
[03:36:23.536 --> 03:36:24.936]  I am seeing this now.
[03:36:25.416 --> 03:36:33.818]  Listen, Democrats are not throwing Joe Biden overboard because they're having some come to Jesus moment where they're like, well, we want the country to be great again.
[03:36:33.858 --> 03:36:35.499]  No, they want someone more radical.
[03:36:37.125 --> 03:36:45.693]  They want someone younger, more radical, so they don't have to worry about these blowouts every single day in the media.
[03:36:45.753 --> 03:36:48.035]  They don't have to worry every single day.
[03:36:48.135 --> 03:36:53.200]  It's not that they're scared that Joe Biden is too old and he can't run the country.
[03:36:53.220 --> 03:36:56.623]  You got to define what that means to these people.
[03:36:57.992 --> 03:36:59.653]  They're not saying Joe Biden's too old.
[03:36:59.693 --> 03:37:00.793]  He can't run the country.
[03:37:00.853 --> 03:37:05.195]  We got to go with someone else because we got to get our country back to where it needs to be.
[03:37:05.255 --> 03:37:05.835]  No, no, no, no, no.
[03:37:06.095 --> 03:37:08.696]  What they mean by that is Joe Biden's too old.
[03:37:09.597 --> 03:37:10.557]  People are now seeing it.
[03:37:11.257 --> 03:37:12.018]  We got to admit it.
[03:37:12.558 --> 03:37:13.458]  We got to get him out.
[03:37:14.078 --> 03:37:25.323]  And we need someone more radical, more younger, so we can continue with our radical agenda without these blowouts that's waking people up.
[03:37:25.911 --> 03:37:32.354]  That's where, when you're watching MSNBC and CNN and Rachel Maddow and, right?
[03:37:32.434 --> 03:37:36.937]  And all these homosexuals on CNN, I forget their names, Anderson Cooper, right?
[03:37:36.957 --> 03:37:39.918]  All these people, all calling for Joe Biden to step down.
[03:37:40.359 --> 03:37:42.179]  That's why they're calling for him to step down.
[03:37:43.700 --> 03:37:45.441]  Because they're ready for someone more radical.
[03:37:45.461 --> 03:37:47.082]  They're done with the old guard.
[03:37:48.403 --> 03:37:50.804]  These old guard Democrat boomers, they're done.
[03:37:51.522 --> 03:37:57.585]  Democrats are just like the next generation, like Millennial Democrats, Gen X Democrats.
[03:37:58.005 --> 03:38:04.008]  They're telling right now very clearly to Boomer Democrats, we are done with you.
[03:38:05.108 --> 03:38:07.489]  That's what this means with the removal of Joe Biden.
[03:38:07.870 --> 03:38:10.931]  Once Joe tips over, you're going to see a sweep.
[03:38:11.291 --> 03:38:15.093]  All of these Boomer Democrats, that's what Boomer Democrats are kind of like.
[03:38:16.857 --> 03:38:21.640]  Some of them are saying, okay, well, Joe needs to step aside because he's too old.
[03:38:21.780 --> 03:38:24.882]  But then they're like, well, I'm kind of the same age.
[03:38:24.942 --> 03:38:25.763]  Am I next?
[03:38:25.783 --> 03:38:26.903]  You see what's happening here?
[03:38:27.524 --> 03:38:33.948]  That's why when you look at Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer, they're kind of like on the fence about it because they're like, well, if I say that, I'm kind of talking about me.
[03:38:35.809 --> 03:38:39.231]  So Democrats, as always, are always getting ahead of Republicans.
[03:38:40.416 --> 03:38:45.798]  When it comes to propping up the next generation, but I think that's very clear what's happening within the Democrat Party.
[03:38:45.818 --> 03:38:49.380]  So don't fall for this like all Democrats are they're finally waking up.
[03:38:49.420 --> 03:38:49.900]  No, they're not.
[03:38:49.940 --> 03:38:56.883]  They're preparing and they are paving the way and rolling out the red carpet for someone more dangerous and more radical than Joe Biden.
[03:38:58.364 --> 03:39:01.585]  Whoever Democrats go with next, listen, mark my words.
[03:39:02.986 --> 03:39:10.349]   Whoever Democrats go with next, whether it's This year, and they actually replace them.
[03:39:12.010 --> 03:39:20.033]  Or whenever they decide to run someone again in the next cycle, right?
[03:39:20.954 --> 03:39:29.818]  Whoever the next selection will be, will make Joe Biden literally look like a conservative and a Republican.
[03:39:32.279 --> 03:39:33.179]  And I really mean that.
[03:39:34.200 --> 03:39:40.570]   Because If you've seen these developments over the past few years, they're embracing full-blown communism.
[03:39:40.610 --> 03:39:46.215]  They're embracing full-blown homosexuality and pedophilia and pushing it all over children.
[03:39:47.015 --> 03:39:52.259]  They are full-blown embracing this anti-Christ, globalist, satanic religion.
[03:39:53.320 --> 03:39:53.561]  Right?
[03:39:54.441 --> 03:40:08.804]   They are just Romans 1, totally depraved, void of morals, reprobates, these psychopaths that are ready To just pull the trigger on anyone.
[03:40:08.824 --> 03:40:10.806]  Look how radical AOC is.
[03:40:11.106 --> 03:40:13.268]  Yeah, she's a retard, but she's pretty damn radical.
[03:40:13.848 --> 03:40:16.530]  To just straight up go after Supreme Court justices.
[03:40:18.311 --> 03:40:20.553]  Just file articles of impeachment.
[03:40:20.573 --> 03:40:20.953]  We're done.
[03:40:22.154 --> 03:40:24.116]  We don't like the way that you serve us.
[03:40:24.756 --> 03:40:26.557]  We don't like your rulings.
[03:40:27.198 --> 03:40:28.459]  Okay, well you're out.
[03:40:30.200 --> 03:40:32.422]  Yeah, that's how authoritarians get down.
[03:40:33.683 --> 03:40:36.829]   And so, That's what the next generation is facing.
[03:40:38.150 --> 03:40:52.921]  And so when it comes to our principles of freedom, or our principles of America First, our principles, our Christian viewpoints, we have to get more radical as well.
[03:40:53.001 --> 03:40:54.602]  Not in terms of physical violence.
[03:40:54.622 --> 03:41:04.521]   What I mean is, stop being so cucked out And stop being so afraid to speak the absolute truth.
[03:41:05.302 --> 03:41:06.003]  THE truth!
[03:41:06.464 --> 03:41:07.465]  So help you God!
[03:41:08.220 --> 03:41:12.141]  In the face of anybody, regardless if it hurts their feelings or not.
[03:41:12.722 --> 03:41:15.103]  And who cares how rich someone may be?
[03:41:15.423 --> 03:41:17.483]  Who cares how popular someone may be?
[03:41:17.824 --> 03:41:24.106]  If they are not in line with our America First values, okay, we hold that person accountable.
[03:41:24.486 --> 03:41:29.428]  And if you are not gonna be in line with our values, get the hell out of the way.
[03:41:29.808 --> 03:41:31.769]  This is America First.
[03:41:33.229 --> 03:41:39.912]   You see, cuz your current, even con ink, The current right wing right now is just trying to appease and please everybody.
[03:41:39.932 --> 03:41:42.054]  Afraid to hurt people's feelings.
[03:41:42.755 --> 03:41:43.576]  That's gotta go.
[03:41:43.596 --> 03:41:45.998]  Owen Schroyer talks about this a lot.
[03:41:47.039 --> 03:41:49.261]  The new right that demands results.
[03:41:50.041 --> 03:41:53.264]  The old right is just like, eh, we'll run on it next year.
[03:41:53.965 --> 03:41:55.366]  No, the new right wants results.
[03:41:55.967 --> 03:41:57.208]  And wants results now.
[03:41:57.648 --> 03:41:58.509]  And that's where we're going.
[03:41:59.176 --> 03:42:01.558]  Alrighty guys, speaking of on, the War Room is up next.
[03:42:01.598 --> 03:42:02.278]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:02.319 --> 03:42:03.039]  Share all the links.
[03:42:03.099 --> 03:42:07.382]  Follow me on X at DrewHLive and Rumble.com slash Drew Hernandez.
[03:42:07.743 --> 03:42:08.844]  I'll see you guys on the next one.
[03:42:09.584 --> 03:42:15.489]  We've seen a lot of people and a lot of corporate media and a lot of pundits.
[03:42:15.989 --> 03:42:21.894]  I see a lot, thousands of articles the last month saying inflow wars will imminently be shut down.
[03:42:23.450 --> 03:42:28.660]  And they panicked with a federally appointed CRO and federally appointed U.S.
[03:42:30.243 --> 03:42:35.373]  trustee from the Justice Department and five weeks ago ordered this place shut without a court order.
[03:42:36.618 --> 03:42:40.359]  The judge excoriated them, fired them three weeks ago.
[03:42:40.379 --> 03:42:48.322]  Then two weeks ago, the Democrat Party lawyers that use the Sandy Hook parents as a front group came in and said, we want him shut down today.
[03:42:48.723 --> 03:42:49.963]  The judge shut that down.
[03:42:50.543 --> 03:42:54.285]  Then they tried to grab InfoWars a week and a half ago at the state court.
[03:42:54.345 --> 03:42:56.166]  The judge said, that's illegal and shut that down.
[03:42:56.406 --> 03:42:57.026]  This is epic.
[03:42:57.506 --> 03:42:58.907]  People say, how is this continuing on?
[03:42:58.947 --> 03:42:59.867]  Because we're fighting.
[03:43:00.427 --> 03:43:01.287]  We're not giving up.
[03:43:01.388 --> 03:43:02.028]  You're praying.
[03:43:02.748 --> 03:43:06.730]  But I love how five weeks ago, I told you this happened, and you're like, oh yeah, they came out in order to shut it down.
[03:43:07.330 --> 03:43:09.091]  You stood up to them and all this, but where's the video?
[03:43:09.291 --> 03:43:11.932]  You want on top of that video, confronting people?
[03:43:12.312 --> 03:43:13.113]  This is serious.
[03:43:13.173 --> 03:43:14.073]  I've tried to not escalate.
[03:43:15.153 --> 03:43:16.394]  Now it's all in the court record.
[03:43:16.514 --> 03:43:17.194]  Of course it's true.
[03:43:17.234 --> 03:43:18.295]  Of course I didn't make this up.
[03:43:18.355 --> 03:43:19.115]  I don't cry wolf.
[03:43:20.156 --> 03:43:26.839]  So, we are surrounded by wolves, but we've got God on our side, and we've got the people that love God supporting us.
[03:43:26.899 --> 03:43:32.001]  So, I need all of you to understand that we're still here for at least three months.
[03:43:33.168 --> 03:43:39.232]  But if people think we're not going to be here and don't support them, FullWorthStore.com, with great sales and great products, will shut down by extension.
[03:43:39.272 --> 03:43:39.893]  That's been happening.
[03:43:40.133 --> 03:43:41.154]  People aren't buying stuff.
[03:43:41.834 --> 03:43:43.735]  Even though we're selling all the products, it's gone away.
[03:43:43.755 --> 03:43:44.816]  Do they think we're about to be shut down?
[03:43:44.876 --> 03:43:45.016]  No.
