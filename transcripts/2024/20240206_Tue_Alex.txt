[00:00:04.943 --> 00:00:05.243]  InfoWars.
[00:00:05.283 --> 00:00:06.664]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:06.764 --> 00:00:07.464]  InfoWars.
[00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:35.642]  Things are getting stranger by the day.
[00:00:36.362 --> 00:00:41.245]  Just a coincidence, or is something more sinister happening right under our noses?
[00:00:42.025 --> 00:00:44.727]  We want to warn you now, this next story is disturbing.
[00:00:44.747 --> 00:00:55.192]  Namely, in earlier times, it was easier to control a million people, literally, than physically, to kill.
[00:00:57.113 --> 00:01:04.515]  Today, it is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control a million people.
[00:01:05.095 --> 00:01:07.316]  It's easier to kill than to control.
[00:01:07.336 --> 00:01:13.117]  I would like to reduce the number of people on the planet because there's too many of us.
[00:01:13.877 --> 00:01:17.078]  It's a planet of finite resources and we're using them.
[00:01:21.294 --> 00:01:22.755]  First, we've got population.
[00:01:23.255 --> 00:01:24.815]  That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[00:01:25.435 --> 00:01:34.259]  Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, healthcare, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15%.
[00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.040]  The true ruling elite are a death cult.
[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.440]  Cure evil.
[00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:42.161]  The elite are extremely wealthy.
[00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:44.762]  They have more money than you can think of.
[00:01:45.723 --> 00:01:49.464]  So why would they want even more money, even more control?
[00:01:51.556 --> 00:01:55.640]  It's because they use their wealth and power to execute their agenda.
[00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:57.502]  To live out their evil.
[00:01:58.222 --> 00:02:01.886]  If you think this is just conspiracy theory, think again.
[00:02:02.486 --> 00:02:03.367]  Look around you.
[00:02:04.268 --> 00:02:07.311]  Everything benefits them, and not humanity.
[00:02:07.671 --> 00:02:09.453]  The globalists have a religion.
[00:02:10.074 --> 00:02:14.117]  To the public it's sold as climate change or the global crisis.
[00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:17.512]  What is the basis of the climate change agenda?
[00:02:18.192 --> 00:02:19.733]  It's population control.
[00:02:20.433 --> 00:02:21.654]  It's depopulation.
[00:02:22.374 --> 00:02:26.575]  The elite look at us as parasites that need to be controlled and killed.
[00:02:27.936 --> 00:02:31.737]  There is an unelected network that controls what the public sees.
[00:02:32.898 --> 00:02:35.239]  Plausible deniability is their cover.
[00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:38.520]  They are playing dumb on every level to gaslight us.
[00:02:40.137 --> 00:02:44.741]  The same agendas throughout history are presented differently with the same goals.
[00:02:45.501 --> 00:02:50.305]  The elite are becoming restless and are now out in the open with who they really are.
[00:02:50.806 --> 00:02:54.389]  Corruption in the government is just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:58.392]  The upper echelon at the top have an anti-human agenda.
[00:03:00.615 --> 00:03:01.896]  Threats of world war.
[00:03:02.296 --> 00:03:07.881]  But behind the scene, it's more about control and backdoor dealings between world governments.
[00:03:08.542 --> 00:03:15.348]  The open border, drug trafficking, human trafficking is covered up and controlled by our own government.
[00:03:15.888 --> 00:03:16.869]  It's deeper than that.
[00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.233]  There is a reason why most of these corruption networks never get shut down.
[00:03:22.954 --> 00:03:26.037]  These anti-humanists control mostly everything.
[00:03:28.186 --> 00:03:33.627]  You'd be shocked to know what the people in most power positions really think of the general public.
[00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:40.868]  The elite's corruption network operates like prison gangs or like a mafia, but on a larger scale.
[00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:45.949]  Blackmail, controllers, handlers, money laundering.
[00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.910]  If you want to stay rich and powerful, you'll have to do their dirty work.
[00:03:51.471 --> 00:03:53.251]  They have their hands in everything.
[00:03:54.306 --> 00:03:57.187]  A lot of these players simply love the spotlight.
[00:03:57.947 --> 00:04:02.969]  Most of the celebrities, politicians, CEOs love the fame and fortune.
[00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:07.110]  But the ones at the top of these groups are completely evil.
[00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:14.912]  Many become unwillingly controlled by signing on into the club without knowing what they are actually involved with behind the scenes.
[00:04:15.773 --> 00:04:19.594]  Most of humanity is asleep and distracted by meaninglessness.
[00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:26.338]  The elite are warning us of a cyber attack, also known as a digital 9-11 event.
[00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.285]  The economy would collapse if we suffered an internet shutdown.
[00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:36.281]  The modern power grid relies on the internet to coordinate power plants.
[00:04:36.982 --> 00:04:45.329]  Without it, each country's national grid will become unbalanced, and local outages escalate into a blackout for most of the world.
[00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:52.756]  A society slipping into chaos will allow the elite to reset and rebuild a world for themselves.
[00:04:53.036 --> 00:04:55.799]  There will be events leading up to a total collapse.
[00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:59.342]  Domestic terror attacks, biological attacks,
[00:05:01.448 --> 00:05:04.010]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalist.
[00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.732]  And people can't identify who's a patriot and who isn't.
[00:05:07.052 --> 00:05:10.194]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalist.
[00:05:10.254 --> 00:05:13.156]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.
[00:05:13.416 --> 00:05:23.984]  That's why I designed this amazing 1776 red, white, and blue Gadsden flag shirt so you can support the Infowar and meet like-minded people everywhere when you wear it.
[00:05:24.104 --> 00:05:29.728]  When you wear these shirts, it creates an amazing amount of energy and it's quite the adventure.

[00:06:02.978 --> 00:06:05.140]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:05.641 --> 00:06:10.766]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:29.428 --> 00:06:35.334]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, February 6th, 2024.
[00:06:35.834 --> 00:06:42.921]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and I'm going to be hosting the full four hours today.
[00:06:44.003 --> 00:06:47.086]  We have three guests in studio.
[00:06:47.706 --> 00:06:49.188]  Before I tell you about that...
[00:06:51.093 --> 00:06:56.939]  Oh, I come into almost every broadcast and say this is the most insane show yet because everything is quickening.
[00:06:57.319 --> 00:06:58.461]  You don't need me to tell you that.
[00:06:58.521 --> 00:06:59.682]  It's not an exaggeration.
[00:07:00.863 --> 00:07:01.163]  Wow.
[00:07:01.243 --> 00:07:03.846]  Well, Tucker Carlson has gotten the Putin interview.
[00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:07.830]  And he's not done yet.
[00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:13.556]  He's going to spend two more weeks in Europe with other amazing things he's up to.
[00:07:15.245 --> 00:07:23.169]  And I'll leave it at that, but I do have some interesting things that I have to say about it.
[00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:39.616]  And I just shot a report about 30 minutes before we went live that Rob knew is finishing up with some B-roll that we'll have in about 15 minutes that I think says it succinctly, and I nailed it, and also breaks some pretty big news.
[00:07:40.417 --> 00:07:42.598]  And so we're going to table that
[00:07:44.474 --> 00:07:48.395]  Until that report is ready and it will speak for itself.
[00:07:52.136 --> 00:07:59.099]  I just posted on X seconds before I went live a headline we'll put on screen for you.
[00:07:59.819 --> 00:08:10.042]  Tucker Carlson tries to stop World War III, bravely travels to Russia to get the Vladimir Putin historic interview.
[00:08:11.897 --> 00:08:12.437]  We're good to go.
[00:08:12.457 --> 00:08:12.678]  I think?
[00:08:43.283 --> 00:08:47.605]  Said Poland is preparing for war and believes they're about to have a war with Russia.
[00:08:48.406 --> 00:08:50.707]  The Swedish defense minister a month ago said that.
[00:08:50.767 --> 00:08:52.968]  The British defense minister two weeks ago said that.
[00:08:54.149 --> 00:08:54.569]  NATO.
[00:08:56.212 --> 00:08:59.313]  I said that Russia is not going to invade any other countries.
[00:09:00.233 --> 00:09:21.958]  Russia, for nine years, said, if you keep running a proxy war against us in Ukraine and kicking the Russians out, where we've been since the founding of Russia a thousand years ago, that's where it started, with Slav the Wise, that's what his name was, or they're called the Slavs after that guy, who repelled the Islamicists and set up what is the Russian culture today.
[00:09:23.513 --> 00:09:29.057]  Putin said, we're just going to take part of the country as a demilitarized zone, and he invaded.
[00:09:31.199 --> 00:09:34.181]  Top German newspaper, Poland prepares for war with Russia.
[00:09:34.201 --> 00:09:37.363]  You can scroll down and click and see it in German for yourself.
[00:09:38.324 --> 00:09:40.585]  Now, Jack Posobiec for over a year has been saying this.
[00:09:40.625 --> 00:09:43.527]  He's one of the smartest people out there when it comes to military affairs.
[00:09:44.108 --> 00:09:45.589]  The guy's not stupid.
[00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:50.933]  And he's also Polish, speaks it in English.
[00:09:52.876 --> 00:09:53.496]  We're good to go.
[00:10:14.008 --> 00:10:14.648]  We're good to go.
[00:10:41.932 --> 00:10:43.273]  Senate Leader Schumer, U.S.
[00:10:43.293 --> 00:10:47.816]  troops could be sent to fight Russia or Iran if Congress doesn't pass border bill.
[00:10:50.377 --> 00:10:52.178]  We are being held hostage.
[00:10:52.238 --> 00:10:54.940]  And if you see my articles today, and they're bright yellow, I didn't pee on them.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.601]  We haven't had them in a birdcage.
[00:10:56.961 --> 00:11:00.823]  The printer's going out, and we put new cartridges in it.
[00:11:01.223 --> 00:11:04.465]  It's printing yellow, so that's a side issue here.
[00:11:05.866 --> 00:11:10.389]  But it's just absolute...
[00:11:12.037 --> 00:11:12.557]  Madness.
[00:11:12.998 --> 00:11:14.559]  Total and complete insanity.
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:24.265]  And all the main doctrines that kept us from having a nuclear war are being ignored.
[00:11:24.345 --> 00:11:28.388]  Remember just a year ago, Biden said, oh, we can't send Abrams tanks and F-16s.
[00:11:28.408 --> 00:11:29.468]  That's World War III.
[00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:30.789]  And now they are.
[00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:35.432]  There's a threat continuum ladder that the Rand Corporation developed.
[00:11:36.973 --> 00:11:40.015]  And they're the brain of this thing to a great extent.
[00:11:40.035 --> 00:11:40.836]  They're a large part of it.
[00:11:41.849 --> 00:11:44.030]  And they said, you can't keep going down this road.
[00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:48.111]  So did the late Henry Kissinger a year and a half ago.
[00:11:49.231 --> 00:11:55.872]  So even the establishment has a bunch of their people saying, this is crazy town.
[00:11:57.593 --> 00:12:10.716]  Now the United States and Japan are doing drills to attack
[00:12:12.068 --> 00:12:12.488]  China.
[00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:18.312]  Now, a lot of the media is like, oh, three years until there's war with Russia.
[00:12:18.832 --> 00:12:19.553]  That's a little independent.
[00:12:19.573 --> 00:12:19.813]  No, no.
[00:12:20.533 --> 00:12:25.937]  The report that leaked out of NATO a month ago says as early as February, this February.
[00:12:28.038 --> 00:12:32.481]  And they said the probability goes up substantially by early next year.
[00:12:34.431 --> 00:12:35.491]  The globalists are in trouble.
[00:12:35.571 --> 00:12:38.092]  There's demonstrations against them all over the world.
[00:12:38.152 --> 00:12:39.412]  Their policies are in trouble.
[00:12:39.452 --> 00:12:40.772]  They, quote, lost the trust.
[00:12:40.832 --> 00:12:41.652]  The people hate them.
[00:12:42.032 --> 00:12:43.353]  They are now known as the villains.
[00:12:44.753 --> 00:12:46.773]  They can't just sit up there and tell us you will eat the bugs.
[00:12:47.213 --> 00:12:49.614]  So they need a big war.
[00:12:49.634 --> 00:12:55.795]  And that's always the cherry on top of a new era they're trying to bring in.
[00:12:56.135 --> 00:12:59.315]  The cashless society, the entire New World Order system.
[00:12:59.375 --> 00:13:02.456]  And I got a bunch of news on that as well today.
[00:13:02.476 --> 00:13:03.536]  So let me tell you what we got here.
[00:13:04.841 --> 00:13:10.205]  The Tucker Carlson information that ties into the war, ties into free speech, ties into intimidation of citizens.
[00:13:10.405 --> 00:13:15.368]  It's like a Rosetta Stone that really gives you a good picture of what's happening.
[00:13:15.388 --> 00:13:16.089]  We're going to get into that.
[00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:26.717]  The corporate media completely and totally flipping out at every level against Tucker.
[00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:34.262]  I never really told this story, not because it made me sound like a coward,
[00:13:36.963 --> 00:13:39.124]  But just because it was just so over the top.
[00:13:39.664 --> 00:13:41.965]  But I went ahead and I tell it in this Tucker piece.
[00:13:43.466 --> 00:13:44.306]  But it was surreal.
[00:13:46.647 --> 00:13:49.508]  I got a Russian visa like five years ago.
[00:13:50.988 --> 00:13:53.990]  Because I was going to go over there and do some interviews and want to see Russia.
[00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:55.830]  And they were calling everybody Russian agents.
[00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:56.390]  And I was sick of it.
[00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:58.051]  And I thought it would be a good thing to do.
[00:13:58.331 --> 00:13:59.051]  Get a lot of attention.
[00:13:59.071 --> 00:13:59.712]  Do a lot of interviews.
[00:14:02.153 --> 00:14:05.014]  And then I hadn't even announced it.
[00:14:05.214 --> 00:14:05.394]  But
[00:14:07.608 --> 00:14:21.017]  The phone calls started coming in through different people in the government that high-level CIA and others were saying, if you go, you're going to be designated as a Russian agent and things are going to get really bad for you.
[00:14:22.338 --> 00:14:24.119]  And I didn't have a Putin interview secured.
[00:14:24.159 --> 00:14:27.462]  I was talking to RT and they said, we'll get you into some of the press junkets.
[00:14:27.942 --> 00:14:29.663]  You'll be able to ask him a question probably.
[00:14:29.703 --> 00:14:36.408]  And I was like, you know, no, I'm still just going to go just as a joke and I was going to wear a Russian fur hat and
[00:14:37.267 --> 00:14:38.709]  You know, say I'm there for my orders.
[00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:43.033]  Because remember, five years ago, I was still making fun of the Russia thing because I knew it was BS.
[00:14:43.634 --> 00:14:44.815]  But it was really starting to get nasty.
[00:14:44.855 --> 00:14:53.144]  They were indicting people and going up to Roger Stone and telling lies about him and that he was involved with Russia and WikiLeaks.
[00:14:53.204 --> 00:14:57.129]  And Roger worked here when that was all going on, and I knew none of it was true.
[00:14:58.906 --> 00:15:00.307]  And I was like, I'll give you a raise.
[00:15:00.327 --> 00:15:02.409]  You can get the WikiLeaks interview.
[00:15:02.429 --> 00:15:05.571]  He goes, well, I know this radio host that knows him, and I might be able to get him on.
[00:15:05.971 --> 00:15:08.113]  And if you remember, he was doing interviews everywhere at the time.
[00:15:10.315 --> 00:15:11.035]  Julian Assange.
[00:15:11.075 --> 00:15:13.377]  So I was just laughing at all this.
[00:15:14.618 --> 00:15:24.065]  But before I get really serious, I was like, you know, I'm not going to – I'm not afraid to skydive, but I'm not going to do it because I don't want to just add a risk for no reason.
[00:15:24.345 --> 00:15:26.267]  Like a lot of people go because they like the chemicals.
[00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:29.151]  The brain releases.
[00:15:30.431 --> 00:15:41.156]  When you go to Las Vegas and play craps or play blackjack or play the roulette wheel or play the slot machines, I will take risk if I think I need to, but I don't enjoy the risk.
[00:15:41.717 --> 00:15:42.857]  I don't get off on the risk.
[00:15:43.297 --> 00:15:46.599]  So I thought it was kind of gratuitous, so I didn't go to Russia.
[00:15:47.299 --> 00:15:56.504]  Well, we know that Tucker got threatened by the NSA and others, and it came out in the news later that indeed they were spying on him and did threaten him.
[00:15:58.157 --> 00:15:58.678]  Think about that.
[00:15:58.698 --> 00:15:59.699]  Because they wanted him to know.
[00:16:00.139 --> 00:16:01.000]  Well, Tucker went.
[00:16:02.522 --> 00:16:10.250]  And I've got to say that if I could get a Putin interview, locked in, I would go as well.
[00:16:11.611 --> 00:16:12.972]  Because then it wouldn't be gratuitous.
[00:16:13.373 --> 00:16:15.935]  I was going to basically troll the left and
[00:16:18.797 --> 00:16:19.217]  We're good to go.
[00:16:45.239 --> 00:16:45.880]  We're good to go.
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.541]  We're good to go.
[00:17:10.675 --> 00:17:28.510]  So it's really, really, really, really important that we stand up for Tucker because you've got the neocons, Bill Kristol and others, saying he shouldn't be allowed back in the country, behind the scenes.
[00:17:29.931 --> 00:17:31.112]  I know Tucker's security people.
[00:17:31.152 --> 00:17:31.852]  They're great guys.
[00:17:33.394 --> 00:17:37.297]  A lot of nasty stuff's been done to Tucker.
[00:17:38.669 --> 00:17:41.430]  He hasn't talked about, and he has a lot of courage.
[00:17:44.571 --> 00:17:45.551]  And he also carries a gun.
[00:17:47.512 --> 00:17:48.272]  And he's a great shot.
[00:17:49.212 --> 00:17:50.032]  And I encouraged Tucker.
[00:17:50.072 --> 00:17:51.713]  I said, man, you're a great hunter, great shot.
[00:17:51.753 --> 00:17:52.933]  You ought to do this on TV.
[00:17:52.973 --> 00:17:54.954]  People need to know what outdoorsman you are.
[00:17:55.874 --> 00:17:59.215]  And he's like, well, I've been growing up here in Maine since I was a kid, in between here and California.
[00:17:59.655 --> 00:18:00.915]  He said, no, no, no, no.
[00:18:01.355 --> 00:18:06.197]  But what he's doing is really historical.
[00:18:07.205 --> 00:18:09.750]  And opens up a dialogue and needs to be done.
[00:18:09.931 --> 00:18:16.163]  And when the Putin interview drops, it's going to be absolutely massive.
[00:18:17.165 --> 00:18:18.387]  It's going to be seismic.
[00:18:19.411 --> 00:18:19.831]  We're good to go.
[00:18:19.851 --> 00:18:20.272]  We're good to go.
[00:18:46.175 --> 00:18:51.098]  And so it's quite the job to go through all of our archives and get those out.
[00:18:51.138 --> 00:18:55.500]  But if the crew has the audio, when you're ready, let me know and I'll play this clip.
[00:18:57.061 --> 00:18:59.763]  Yeah, so this is five years ago.
[00:18:59.783 --> 00:19:02.104]  I was trolling the media.
[00:19:04.466 --> 00:19:06.767]  It's the one time I've gone down to that place that serves Russian food.
[00:19:06.787 --> 00:19:07.247]  It's pretty good.
[00:19:07.267 --> 00:19:07.667]  It's fun.
[00:19:08.448 --> 00:19:09.809]  They have vodka tastings and stuff.
[00:19:10.649 --> 00:19:12.250]  And, you know, the crew and I just went down there and...
[00:19:14.878 --> 00:19:17.340]  Right after this, I got three phone calls.
[00:19:19.481 --> 00:19:23.344]  And... Well, I got two phone calls.
[00:19:24.404 --> 00:19:38.974]  And then... Someone close to me that's got a long background in the military and law enforcement and federal agent said, man, I got a call by a high-level CIA guy that I worked with in Afghanistan.
[00:19:39.394 --> 00:19:40.114]  And he said, listen...
[00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:42.081]  Remember when Tucker...
[00:20:08.854 --> 00:20:16.920]  Came out two years ago and said, I was told by an NSA whistleblower that they're listening to everything I'm doing, they're watching me, they're reading this stuff, they're aware of it, and that I better not go to Russia.
[00:20:19.522 --> 00:20:34.912]  And what I was told was, Putin told Tucker after this, listen, for your own safety, now is not the time for this.
[00:20:36.574 --> 00:20:38.395]  So I'm not giving you the interview.
[00:20:40.529 --> 00:20:42.590]  I mean, that's... And you know why?
[00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:47.971]  The Russians got told, you better not do this interview.
[00:20:50.312 --> 00:21:04.556]  And I later learned that... When I used to go on RT a lot, I mean, I've been on Iranian TV, Mexican TV, Brazilian TV, Japanese TV, British TV, and...
[00:21:05.832 --> 00:21:08.714]  Back when I would do the interviews, which is every day, it would be other interviews.
[00:21:08.754 --> 00:21:16.779]  So I probably did RT 50 times, probably did British TV 60, 70 times or more, did Japanese TV about 15 times, Iranian TV about 20, 30 times.
[00:21:16.799 --> 00:21:17.680]  I can't even keep track of it.
[00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.122]  But I finally stopped doing those interviews because I was so busy.
[00:21:22.543 --> 00:21:31.929]  And I later learned from the RT people, from their number two person, that, oh, no, we got a State Department call
[00:21:33.018 --> 00:21:37.280]  This is like six years ago, seven years ago, and threatened them.
[00:21:38.221 --> 00:21:43.743]  And basically threatened them, if you know what's good for Alex Jones, you better stop trying to interview him.
[00:21:45.264 --> 00:21:52.267]  And only recently have they called up, and just to not be a wimp, I've gone on national, international RT, like their biggest shows.
[00:21:52.908 --> 00:21:54.068]  Because I have a right to do that.
[00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:58.010]  And I have a right to expose the globalists that have hijacked our country.
[00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:01.552]  But this attempt by the criminals that run our government...
[00:22:02.932 --> 00:22:05.653]  They're the ones doing it, folks!
[00:22:36.032 --> 00:22:36.872]  I mean, look at this headline.
[00:22:38.273 --> 00:22:38.893]  CNBC.
[00:22:38.993 --> 00:22:41.114]  Tucker Carlson reportedly seen leaving Putin's office.
[00:22:41.154 --> 00:22:43.896]  Tensions rise at Russian-held nuclear plant.
[00:22:45.156 --> 00:22:46.437]  And that's the big false flag.
[00:22:46.457 --> 00:22:47.137]  Print that for me, guys.
[00:22:47.177 --> 00:22:51.559]  That's the big false flag they've been ready for.
[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:59.883]  They've been saying the Russians are going to blow up the biggest nuclear power plant in the world right there in eastern Ukraine.
[00:23:01.524 --> 00:23:03.505]  And then they've said, oh, Russians hit it with artillery.
[00:23:03.565 --> 00:23:04.425]  Russians hit it with missiles.
[00:23:04.746 --> 00:23:05.206]  And then later...
[00:23:06.564 --> 00:23:07.124]  We're good to go.
[00:23:07.144 --> 00:23:07.504]  We're good to go.
[00:23:07.524 --> 00:23:08.064]  We're good to go.
[00:23:35.905 --> 00:23:44.049]  And then our government's in the business that's all hijacked to threaten Tucker, threaten me, do all this stuff.
[00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:49.231]  And I'm just fed up with it.
[00:23:52.773 --> 00:23:54.654]  But Tucker told me that I should go.
[00:23:55.334 --> 00:23:56.515]  And maybe I'll go with him.
[00:23:56.955 --> 00:23:59.456]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:23:59.516 --> 00:24:00.817]  I'll jump on an airplane tomorrow.
[00:24:01.997 --> 00:24:05.099]  I know I've got Tate Brothers that want me to come this month.
[00:24:05.896 --> 00:24:06.536]  We're good to go.
[00:24:35.797 --> 00:24:40.938]  I've got to go on air and just absolutely lay it out to people that we're sleepwalking into doom.
[00:24:41.619 --> 00:24:44.339]  At every level, things are unraveling and falling apart.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:48.040]  And the globalists hate us and project their own hate of themselves onto us.
[00:24:48.101 --> 00:24:54.402]  But did you know there's 450-something active nuclear power plants in the world?
[00:24:55.143 --> 00:25:00.124]  And then hundreds and hundreds of other nuke power plants for submarines, aircraft carriers.
[00:25:00.164 --> 00:25:03.345]  There's a bunch of research reactors.
[00:25:04.605 --> 00:25:06.627]  There's around a thousand reactors we know of.
[00:25:06.827 --> 00:25:07.768]  There's probably a lot more.
[00:25:09.089 --> 00:25:13.013]  And our own government and other governments' history is when they leak or explode, they cover them up.
[00:25:13.453 --> 00:25:20.920]  We had a Chernobyl event back in the 50s with a sodium nuclear reactor in California that they didn't declassify until the 80s.
[00:25:22.241 --> 00:25:23.362]  It was a Chernobyl bad.
[00:25:23.382 --> 00:25:24.283]  It was huge.
[00:25:24.843 --> 00:25:25.464]  Total meltdown.
[00:25:26.625 --> 00:25:26.965]  Look it up.
[00:25:27.706 --> 00:25:28.747]  But did you know out of the 450 plus...
[00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:32.011]  What type of establishment is that?
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:53.262]  Where the left doesn't even care about leaking nuclear reactors.
[00:25:54.083 --> 00:25:56.545]  Nuclear power works great if it's done right.
[00:25:57.646 --> 00:26:02.971]  People need to sign an agreement when they work there that they're facing the death penalty if they don't do their job properly.
[00:26:07.094 --> 00:26:16.523]  Japan building three general electric plutonium reactors on top of the biggest fault line in the world in a tsunami zone.
[00:26:18.695 --> 00:26:20.457]  I mean, why did General Electric even agree to that?
[00:26:20.997 --> 00:26:23.119]  And the Japanese are probably some of the smartest people in the world.
[00:26:23.139 --> 00:26:23.980]  What's their problem?
[00:26:24.821 --> 00:26:26.082]  Like, what is going on here?
[00:26:27.724 --> 00:26:30.406]  It's like putting cyanide in your kid's Wheaties for no reason.
[00:26:31.327 --> 00:26:32.848]  I mean, what?
[00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.889]  I mean, huh.
[00:26:35.271 --> 00:26:38.974]  And then the poison shots that have killed at least 20 million people.
[00:26:39.935 --> 00:26:40.696]  And they admit it.
[00:26:41.724 --> 00:26:43.985]  And the cancer is just exploding.
[00:26:44.886 --> 00:26:51.230]  And I'm just asking myself, why are we committing suicide as a culture, as a species?
[00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:53.951]  And the globalists have got to be smart.
[00:26:54.511 --> 00:26:55.832]  Can't they look at where this is going?
[00:26:55.872 --> 00:26:57.953]  They'll never get away with killing everybody now.
[00:26:58.134 --> 00:26:59.875]  They'll never get away with their new world order.
[00:26:59.995 --> 00:27:06.358]  They'll never get away with cutting all the resources off and hoping we'll all just kill each other while they sit off in some underground bunker.
[00:27:06.378 --> 00:27:09.020]  We're going to go to those bunkers and eat you.
[00:27:10.421 --> 00:27:10.821]  Literally.
[00:27:13.357 --> 00:27:14.057]  We're good to go.
[00:27:39.528 --> 00:27:42.489]  And I just sit back, and I see the ignorance level.
[00:27:42.889 --> 00:27:45.350]  There was hundreds of thousands of comments on X Today.
[00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:52.593]  And a couple posts I did, millions of views, tens of thousands of comments, and I was trying to read through them.
[00:27:52.613 --> 00:27:53.673]  It was just so fascinating.
[00:27:54.774 --> 00:28:00.276]  And I'm like, explaining that the ice caps are getting bigger, not smaller.
[00:28:02.877 --> 00:28:05.578]  And I'm explaining that the ice caps were getting smaller on Mars.
[00:28:06.812 --> 00:28:16.074]  Until about 2010, because there was some warming, and the solar system cooled off because the sun cooled off some, and so our ice caps got bigger, and so did Mars.
[00:28:16.654 --> 00:28:25.656]  And I see people commenting, they're like professors and stuff, and you go read their bios, and they're like, the sun has no effect on climate, that is well established.
[00:28:25.676 --> 00:28:28.377]  Well, the astrophysicists will tell you it's 99.9% of it.
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:39.582]  I've interviewed astrophysicists, but it's just absolutely frightening how ignorant people are.
[00:28:41.403 --> 00:28:42.823]  Absolute morons.
[00:28:43.864 --> 00:28:45.584]  All right, I'm loaded for bear on the news.
[00:28:46.144 --> 00:28:48.285]  I've got the Tucker Carlson breakdown when we come back.
[00:28:48.785 --> 00:28:51.286]  And I've got that little joke Russia piece all air as well.
[00:28:51.846 --> 00:28:54.027]  And then we've got three huge guests in studio.
[00:28:54.067 --> 00:28:55.607]  Michael Young's first stop straight ahead.
[00:28:55.627 --> 00:28:56.048]  Stay with us.
[00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:03.093]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[00:29:03.493 --> 00:29:10.496]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[00:29:10.676 --> 00:29:12.677]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[00:29:12.877 --> 00:29:13.918]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[00:29:13.938 --> 00:29:14.658]  He loved the idea.
[00:29:14.998 --> 00:29:18.499]  What would you call the debate and discussion about a pro-human future?
[00:29:18.539 --> 00:29:19.400]  Just Team Humanity?
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.360]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:20.960]  Absolutely.
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.681]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[00:29:22.741 --> 00:29:26.182]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[00:29:26.402 --> 00:29:33.845]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to give info on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[00:29:34.105 --> 00:29:45.828]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a revolution against the globalists and it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[00:29:46.108 --> 00:29:47.428]  We're told humans are the problem.
[00:29:47.468 --> 00:29:48.448]  We're told we're killing the Earth.
[00:29:48.728 --> 00:29:52.989]  We're told all this garbage so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:53.990]  We're not going to do that.
[00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:58.891]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[00:29:59.551 --> 00:30:01.814]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[00:30:01.994 --> 00:30:02.354]  Thank you.
[00:30:02.534 --> 00:30:05.097]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[00:30:05.157 --> 00:30:06.419]  I started taking that stuff.
[00:30:06.459 --> 00:30:09.662]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[00:30:09.762 --> 00:30:10.663]  When did you start taking it?
[00:30:10.963 --> 00:30:14.808]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[00:30:14.828 --> 00:30:15.088]  Mm-hmm.
[00:30:15.548 --> 00:30:18.251]  And I started eating a little better, but my blood pressure stayed high.
[00:30:18.271 --> 00:30:25.800]  And when I took X2 iodine after about two or four weeks, I think my body was detoxified of a bunch of metals and stuff that my body was storing.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.122]  And my blood pressure came down to perfect level.
[00:30:28.502 --> 00:30:31.446]  And I tell people the only thing I did with X2 iodine
[00:30:31.766 --> 00:30:32.406]  I think we're good.
[00:30:59.575 --> 00:31:04.178]  29 years on air, all I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalists.
[00:31:04.899 --> 00:31:10.222]  And I've done the best job I can to tell those words that have been accurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[00:31:10.602 --> 00:31:17.047]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves, unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people.
[00:31:17.287 --> 00:31:17.967]  We don't do that.
[00:31:18.447 --> 00:31:20.329]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[00:31:20.709 --> 00:31:22.730]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product.
[00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:23.351]  It's so powerful.
[00:31:24.271 --> 00:31:34.319]  This is the breakdown product after your cells process it of folic acid, methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[00:31:34.779 --> 00:31:36.020]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.261]  It's not a stimulant.
[00:31:37.381 --> 00:31:38.983]  It energizes your cells.
[00:31:39.543 --> 00:31:44.385]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the global agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[00:32:07.561 --> 00:32:20.550]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections masquerading as vaccines.
[00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:25.654]  It is so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives oblivious.
[00:32:27.015 --> 00:32:29.737]  And you realize ignorance is not bliss, it equals death.
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:51.796]  But people are starting to really understand how serious things are, and that's a hard thing to do, because to wake up to a dystopic reality and realize that we're in the middle of a giant biological weapons war against humanity, and that there's mass sterilization that's already taking place, and they're cutting off all the major energy sources, is really hard to deal with, but it's the reality.
[00:32:52.357 --> 00:32:56.540]  Facing it is our only chance to turn this around, because stuff's about to get really, really nasty.
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:57.581]  Infowars.com
[00:33:00.936 --> 00:33:04.118]  Well, I'm in the company of Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan and Elon Musk and
[00:33:33.035 --> 00:33:33.595]  David Icke.
[00:33:34.716 --> 00:33:35.857]  So many other great people.
[00:33:36.897 --> 00:33:43.381]  All the most popular people across the world, not just here, are anti-globalist, anti-New World Order.
[00:33:44.001 --> 00:33:45.902]  We have now identified the New World Order.
[00:33:46.683 --> 00:33:48.924]  That has been my goal for 30 years on air.
[00:33:48.984 --> 00:33:50.465]  Coming up in April will be 30 years.
[00:33:53.847 --> 00:33:53.967]  And...
[00:33:55.293 --> 00:33:56.013]  That was our goal.
[00:33:56.293 --> 00:34:09.777]  I believed, I knew, that if we exposed their plan while it was in the beta phase, that we might be able to stop at the beta phase, but I was sure once it went into operational, we'd have a very good chance of beating it because we would have planted so many seeds.
[00:34:11.597 --> 00:34:22.260]  And I would just marvel how the New York Times would say there's no new world order, no global government, no megabanks controlling anything, and then they would have their foreign affairs publications and CFR publications
[00:34:24.037 --> 00:34:37.647]  And they're super PhD, you know, heads of political science at Harvard, Yale, Georgetown, Princeton, University of Texas, writing 300, 400, 500, 1,100 page books.
[00:34:37.687 --> 00:34:39.128]  Tragedy and Hopes, 1,100 pages long.
[00:34:39.709 --> 00:34:40.650]  I read the whole damn thing.
[00:34:42.811 --> 00:34:43.171]  When I was 20.
[00:34:43.612 --> 00:34:47.695]  Tried to read it again a few years ago, couldn't get through 100 pages of it.
[00:34:49.386 --> 00:34:53.668]  And it's just the head of the Georgetown Political Science Department, Bill Clinton's main mentor.
[00:34:56.228 --> 00:34:59.330]  Carol Quigley taught me everything I know, except for David Rockefeller.
[00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:09.113]  When I was 16, when David came to visit me and my mama, he said I was going to be president one day, and I just couldn't believe it.
[00:35:09.153 --> 00:35:10.934]  But thank you, David Rockefeller.
[00:35:10.954 --> 00:35:13.294]  He started crying on TV his last year in the presidency.
[00:35:13.635 --> 00:35:14.675]  That video's somewhere.
[00:35:15.215 --> 00:35:16.656]  It's so searchable now, guys.
[00:35:16.796 --> 00:35:17.256]  Go find...
[00:35:19.602 --> 00:35:22.083]  Bill Clinton talks about David Rockefeller.
[00:35:22.103 --> 00:35:24.424]  There's dozens of times, but he starts crying.
[00:35:24.504 --> 00:35:25.184]  And you know why?
[00:35:25.724 --> 00:35:30.766]  The governor was his brother, whatever it was.
[00:35:30.786 --> 00:35:32.126]  It was his close relation to David.
[00:35:34.007 --> 00:35:35.187]  I forget which Rockefeller it was.
[00:35:35.207 --> 00:35:36.147]  It'll pop in my head in a minute.
[00:35:36.587 --> 00:35:37.688]  Winthrop Rockefeller.
[00:35:38.968 --> 00:35:42.549]  He was the governor, and she was a prostitute in the Capitol.
[00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:43.550]  Little Rock.
[00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:44.630]  This is on record, by the way.
[00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:47.451]  And reportedly, Bill Clinton is a Rockefeller.
[00:35:49.085 --> 00:35:51.766]  So, that's what you see there.
[00:35:53.507 --> 00:35:56.208]  And Rockefeller would come visit him when he was a kid.
[00:35:56.228 --> 00:35:57.309]  What?
[00:35:58.650 --> 00:35:59.470]  Bill Clinton said that.
[00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:15.738]  Just like in Dreams of My Father, Obama's book, he talks about how much he loved Frank Marshall Davis, the former deputy head of the Communist Party of the USA, the head of all their newspapers, who lived in Hawaii, and he would, quote, spend summers with...
[00:36:16.854 --> 00:36:19.756]  Frank Marshall Davis, who he said was like a father to him.
[00:36:21.297 --> 00:36:25.039]  And then his mother is in the black and white porn mags.
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:30.883]  It's her on the same couch, in the same house with the same pictures, at Frank Marshall Davis' house.
[00:36:30.903 --> 00:36:32.004]  He was also a pornographer.
[00:36:33.185 --> 00:36:34.166]  So it's his daddy.
[00:36:35.847 --> 00:36:36.747]  Wasn't born in Kenya.
[00:36:36.787 --> 00:36:37.848]  All that was a fake story.
[00:36:37.868 --> 00:36:40.350]  That's why I used to say I was born in Kenya when he was a senator.
[00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:42.751]  People say, you say you're born in Kenya in two speeches.
[00:36:43.832 --> 00:36:46.514]  That's the psyop because it's Frank Marshall Davis.
[00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:49.430]  Side issue.
[00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:51.131]  It's just wild.
[00:36:52.051 --> 00:37:04.654]  So, let's go ahead and air this breakdown that I've also posted on X, and I'm asking everybody to go get it and repost it off of X because it needs to be seen.
[00:37:04.695 --> 00:37:12.357]  It's a message to Tucker, and I talk to Tucker quite a bit, but this message is to all of his great crew and his people to really listen to me, and I know he listens to me.
[00:37:12.857 --> 00:37:16.738]  He's also extremely smart, so I'm not trying to say he needs me to explain how the
[00:37:17.833 --> 00:37:19.374]  Cow ate the cabbage or how the world works.
[00:37:19.414 --> 00:37:24.659]  But the headline on real Alex Jones at X is Tucker Carlson lands historic.
[00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:29.343]  Tucker Carlson lands history-changing interview with Putin.
[00:37:30.384 --> 00:37:31.585]  And I say, this is a warning.
[00:37:31.645 --> 00:37:34.347]  Please don't sit on the interview.
[00:37:35.909 --> 00:37:41.353]  Because I know his crew is awesome, and it's usually good to hype it and sit on something and polish it.
[00:37:42.594 --> 00:37:44.176]  If I was them, I don't know what they're going to do.
[00:37:45.131 --> 00:37:46.511]  But I've also texted Tucker this.
[00:37:47.892 --> 00:37:51.073]  I would sit in the hotel room until it's done, and I would release it now.
[00:37:52.593 --> 00:37:54.014]  Because these people are dangerous.
[00:37:55.014 --> 00:37:57.095]  They do not want Putin to be heard by the world.
[00:37:58.395 --> 00:38:00.215]  So, it's quite the moment.
[00:38:00.836 --> 00:38:03.937]  Let's go ahead and roll my emergency message to Tucker Carlson.
[00:38:05.217 --> 00:38:11.959]  The biggest newspaper in Germany, Bild, is now reporting that Poland is preparing to go to war with Russia.
[00:38:12.754 --> 00:38:15.575]  The UK is reporting that they're preparing to go to war with Russia.
[00:38:15.935 --> 00:38:17.115]  So is Sweden.
[00:38:17.455 --> 00:38:21.936]  This is full-on escalation to nuclear World War III.
[00:38:22.376 --> 00:38:23.277]  Armageddon stuff.
[00:38:23.877 --> 00:38:30.958]  And we should be talking to people like Vladimir Putin, just like President Kennedy did during the Cuban Missile Crisis to Khrushchev.
[00:38:31.339 --> 00:38:34.219]  But instead, the communication channels have been cut off.
[00:38:34.719 --> 00:38:41.361]  So, an emissary from America for world peace, Tucker has gone to Moscow to interview Vladimir Putin.
[00:38:41.901 --> 00:38:43.742]  And the globalists are calling him a traitor.
[00:38:44.263 --> 00:38:45.264]  No, he's a hero.
[00:38:45.564 --> 00:38:51.668]  Those of you starting World War III are treasonous against humanity and we're going to stop you.
[00:39:02.435 --> 00:39:03.857]  Massive speculation.
[00:39:03.957 --> 00:39:06.060]  You could cut the suspense with a knife.
[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:11.907]  Has Tucker Carlson gotten the big in-depth history-changing interview with Vladimir Putin?
[00:39:12.648 --> 00:39:14.470]  I know that I talked to Tucker before he went to Europe.
[00:39:15.578 --> 00:39:17.559]  He told me he was going to do something very, very exciting.
[00:39:17.579 --> 00:39:19.200]  It was going to be huge.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.061]  Wouldn't say specifically what.
[00:39:21.121 --> 00:39:22.862]  Told me he was going to first be going to Turkey.
[00:39:22.882 --> 00:39:24.683]  That he'd be gone for three weeks.
[00:39:25.904 --> 00:39:28.345]  And obviously he's in Moscow.
[00:39:28.405 --> 00:39:32.848]  And the word now being reported by Newsweek and some other publications is that he did.
[00:39:33.468 --> 00:39:34.509]  We're good to go.
[00:39:56.952 --> 00:40:01.054]  And even more stuff's coming after the Putin interview.
[00:40:01.654 --> 00:40:04.616]  And again, I haven't talked to him in the last day or so.
[00:40:04.636 --> 00:40:10.119]  I don't know if it's true that he landed the Putin interview, but you've got such an interesting person in Tucker and so smart.
[00:40:10.659 --> 00:40:17.162]  And then Vladimir Putin, at this time in the world, is probably the most important person in the world after somebody like Elon Musk.
[00:40:17.702 --> 00:40:18.103]  People like...
[00:40:19.003 --> 00:40:19.384]  We're good to go.
[00:40:39.921 --> 00:40:46.004]  A little bird told me that indeed he's gotten the interview with Putin.
[00:40:46.804 --> 00:40:54.787]  And I would just tell Tucker, and I'll tell him this when I talk to him, that they're really scared of you, Tucker, because you are a folk hero all over the world, not just here.
[00:40:54.807 --> 00:40:56.688]  In fact, he's even more popular overseas.
[00:40:56.728 --> 00:40:57.228]  It's crazy.
[00:40:58.169 --> 00:41:01.390]  And you need to be very, very careful.
[00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:05.052]  And I think you're in danger while the interview's not out.
[00:41:05.992 --> 00:41:07.793]  I know your fabulous crew has a tendency to
[00:41:08.979 --> 00:41:10.100]  We're good to go.
[00:41:34.033 --> 00:41:34.213]  I think?
[00:42:00.132 --> 00:42:04.614]  And let's not forget how much courage Tucker Carlson has to go do this interview.
[00:42:05.454 --> 00:42:10.737]  You'd think in the past that you wouldn't need any courage at all because reporters are allowed to go interview who they want.
[00:42:10.777 --> 00:42:20.681]  But in this age of tyranny, as George Orwell said, in a world of universal deceit telling the truth, a revolutionary act, in this time of men being cucked and cowards,
[00:42:21.201 --> 00:42:24.562]  He's standing up as an example for us all, and truth is contagious.
[00:42:24.982 --> 00:42:27.142]  Remember, he said he was threatened by the NSA.
[00:42:27.522 --> 00:42:32.624]  He was told by NSA whistleblowers that they were spying on him and tried to designate him as a Russian agent.
[00:42:33.064 --> 00:42:38.665]  And when he was actually going to go, he got huddled with contacts saying, look, you'll be designated as an enemy of the state.
[00:42:38.685 --> 00:42:39.685]  They'll come after you.
[00:42:40.025 --> 00:42:41.105]  He's on record saying that.
[00:42:41.806 --> 00:42:43.406]  And, you know, I never really told this story.
[00:42:43.426 --> 00:42:47.127]  But do you remember when I got my Russian visa?
[00:42:48.089 --> 00:42:51.392]  Like five years ago, and I thought the whole Russiagate thing was a joke.
[00:42:51.772 --> 00:42:53.553]  I mean, I wasn't taking it seriously because I knew it was a fraud.
[00:42:53.573 --> 00:42:57.857]  I didn't know how serious they were coming after people that are against World War III or questioning their tyranny.
[00:42:58.798 --> 00:43:04.342]  We got contacted by high-level CIA and threatened as well, three separate times.
[00:43:04.722 --> 00:43:06.984]  So I'll put on screen a shot of my Russian visa.
[00:43:07.865 --> 00:43:14.230]  And so by then I started taking it serious because they started arresting people and indicting people that were totally innocent and what they did to General Flynn and Roger Stone.
[00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:15.651]  So I said, hey, I better not go.
[00:43:16.892 --> 00:43:23.963]  Just because I was tied down here with my children and all the stuff going on, and I probably should have just said screw you and gone.
[00:43:24.423 --> 00:43:29.791]  I'm being honest about the fact that when that happened, I was like, wow, this is wild.
[00:43:30.833 --> 00:43:31.674]  And I kind of weighed...
[00:43:32.827 --> 00:43:33.287]  We're good to go.
[00:43:33.367 --> 00:43:34.068]  We're good to go.
[00:43:59.079 --> 00:44:09.202]  I understood there was a giant witch hunt going on, and I didn't want to, like, basically play into their hands, but that was wrong, ladies and gentlemen, because I had nothing to do with the Russians, and I have a right to travel and do what I want.
[00:44:09.222 --> 00:44:10.082]  This is a load of crap.
[00:44:10.743 --> 00:44:23.666]  So you made my life a lot safer, because five, six, seven years ago, the globalists decided that I was the big, you know, populist folk hero that had to be destroyed, and so they've kind of moved their attack over to you, and I think, overall, you do a much better job than I do.
[00:44:24.327 --> 00:44:24.527]  So...
[00:44:25.587 --> 00:44:29.090]  Again, you're the main target, and I'm not wishing any of this.
[00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:30.531]  I'm not hoping any of this, obviously.
[00:44:30.871 --> 00:44:34.494]  People always spin it when I warn Trump he needs to really be safe.
[00:44:35.275 --> 00:44:39.398]  I'm drawing attention to this so that we can all pray for Tucker and his amazing crew.
[00:44:40.179 --> 00:44:42.641]  I know that I'm planning at the end of the month when he gets back.
[00:44:43.422 --> 00:44:51.028]  They've got me in a slot to come interview him, but he's so busy I might just try to get him as fast as I can just to pop on my show because he's promised to do that.
[00:44:51.788 --> 00:44:52.709]  But this is just wild.
[00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:54.310]  I've also got David Icke coming on.
[00:44:55.151 --> 00:45:00.436]  Friday in the second hour and the third hour to discuss and debate Elon Musk.
[00:45:00.837 --> 00:45:03.219]  He thinks Elon Musk is a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[00:45:03.239 --> 00:45:10.546]  I think Elon Musk is a maverick who's moving more and more towards us every day very rapidly, so I'm not going to, you know...
[00:45:11.307 --> 00:45:12.007]  We're good to go.
[00:45:29.994 --> 00:45:31.234]  Because he's only been there for a week.
[00:45:31.714 --> 00:45:34.455]  So he's got two weeks left in Europe.
[00:45:34.555 --> 00:45:35.115]  I didn't pry.
[00:45:35.155 --> 00:45:35.936]  He was just giddy.
[00:45:35.976 --> 00:45:41.097]  I've never seen Tucker or never heard Tucker so excited as he is about this Europe trip.
[00:45:41.597 --> 00:45:43.018]  He was excited about this months ago.
[00:45:44.018 --> 00:45:45.438]  He told me he was going to Europe for something big.
[00:45:45.478 --> 00:45:46.999]  I went, oh, something big.
[00:45:47.459 --> 00:45:50.159]  So it is the Putin interview.
[00:45:50.179 --> 00:45:51.200]  He certainly went there to get it.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:53.400]  And I would imagine he did get it.
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:55.721]  So, ladies and gentlemen, this is historic.
[00:45:55.741 --> 00:45:58.362]  Oh, I almost forgot the big reason I cut this video.
[00:46:01.414 --> 00:46:03.095]  The reason I put this report out.
[00:46:03.115 --> 00:46:16.879]  I also have some other sources that are reporting to me what Putin is planning to come out with next, exposing the West, and that's the bioweapon labs and what their discoveries were and what their findings were.
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:29.304]  And the word is, is that even when Putin talks to Tucker, which we're told has already happened, it's going to be a lengthy interview and that he's going to basically report to the American people from the Russian side
[00:46:30.044 --> 00:46:30.684]  We're good to go.
[00:46:30.704 --> 00:46:31.004]  I think?
[00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:46.731]  Peter Jennings, they all did it.
[00:46:47.251 --> 00:46:50.573]  You're supposed to go interview these people, but I'm not going to lie to folks.
[00:46:52.314 --> 00:46:54.335]  I don't think Putin is an enemy of America.
[00:46:54.856 --> 00:46:59.198]  Xi Jinping clearly is, and has taken over much of our government and our system, and the left totally allied with him.
[00:46:59.518 --> 00:47:05.322]  The globalists that hate our guts, they're dissolving our border, that are doing all these horrible criminal things, hate the Russians.
[00:47:05.762 --> 00:47:10.865]  And they started the war nine years ago by overthrowing the Ukrainian government, and there's a whole backstory to that civil war.
[00:47:11.945 --> 00:47:12.286]  And so...
[00:47:13.206 --> 00:47:19.207]  I think it's important for people not to be bullied into being haters of Russia.
[00:47:19.487 --> 00:47:23.908]  If Russia was in our business like China or like Hollywood, I'd hate Russia.
[00:47:24.028 --> 00:47:25.368]  I'd hate Vladimir Putin.
[00:47:26.008 --> 00:47:29.869]  But it's not Vladimir Putin that's trying to put our president in jail for no reason.
[00:47:30.489 --> 00:47:32.710]  It's not Vladimir Putin that's got drag queen story time.
[00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:37.130]  It's not Vladimir Putin promoting pedophilia on the nightly news and in our elementary schools.
[00:47:38.291 --> 00:47:40.351]  It's a total distraction, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:41.738 --> 00:47:45.722]  On to Russia for what's going on here domestically.
[00:47:46.002 --> 00:47:47.964]  So what did Vladimir Putin do to you?
[00:47:49.065 --> 00:47:51.187]  And then if you don't want war with Russia, you're a Russian agent.
[00:47:51.247 --> 00:47:52.789]  No, it means you're sane.
[00:47:53.129 --> 00:47:58.034]  I don't like the Iranian mullahs, but I don't want war with them because it all leads to nuclear war.
[00:47:58.734 --> 00:48:01.717]  So some big, big news is coming out of this.
[00:48:02.728 --> 00:48:03.368]  Putin interview.
[00:48:03.468 --> 00:48:04.489]  It's going to be historic.
[00:48:05.129 --> 00:48:08.170]  And again, I think Tucker Carlson needs to get it out immediately.
[00:48:09.111 --> 00:48:11.092]  It's too tempting a target for the globalists.
[00:48:12.152 --> 00:48:15.594]  Bottom line, have dozens of copies sent to everybody you know if you're going to sit on it.
[00:48:16.254 --> 00:48:18.175]  Because I know sitting on it makes it that much bigger.
[00:48:18.195 --> 00:48:21.936]  But something like this, I just gut level, instinctive level, spiritual level.
[00:48:22.477 --> 00:48:24.177]  Get it out now, Tucker, and we love you.
[00:48:24.938 --> 00:48:30.540]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:48:31.881 --> 00:48:32.221]  InfoWars.com
[00:48:36.445 --> 00:48:38.606]  We're good to go.
[00:48:38.626 --> 00:48:39.206]  We're good to go.
[00:48:57.199 --> 00:49:00.800]  Fourteen governors came down, thousands of people, huge attention.
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.681]  The left didn't get what they wanted.
[00:49:03.381 --> 00:49:04.561]  They caught some provocateurs.
[00:49:05.402 --> 00:49:09.383]  And so Doc's going to be with us in the second part of the interview.
[00:49:10.243 --> 00:49:11.283]  He'll be in the control room.
[00:49:11.744 --> 00:49:15.325]  I built these really cool big control rooms so we can have guests in there, too.
[00:49:15.365 --> 00:49:17.605]  It really gives that ambiance, and I like it.
[00:49:17.625 --> 00:49:21.827]  So he's going to be in there talking about what happened and what's coming next.
[00:49:21.847 --> 00:49:22.527]  We're going to talk about...
[00:49:24.005 --> 00:49:24.886]  We're good to go.
[00:49:49.555 --> 00:49:50.716]  We're good to go.
[00:50:07.935 --> 00:50:08.936]  We're good to go.
[00:50:08.976 --> 00:50:09.116]  I think?
[00:50:24.624 --> 00:50:29.107]  With us to cover the waterfront in the fourth hour today.
[00:50:29.127 --> 00:50:40.334]  She's also a great media producer, so we're working with her, and it's great to have her here with us today in studio as well.
[00:50:40.934 --> 00:50:43.016]  We've got about eight minutes to break here.
[00:50:44.657 --> 00:50:52.802]  All this news ties together, but getting back to the Tucker Carlson thing, the story is, why does it scare the establishment here so much?
[00:50:53.666 --> 00:50:57.067]  That he is bigger than Joe Rogan.
[00:50:57.107 --> 00:50:58.268]  And it's not about how big you are.
[00:50:58.308 --> 00:51:06.430]  But when it comes to really reaching the most people, I have to say Tucker has eclipsed Rogan.
[00:51:07.331 --> 00:51:09.692]  And Rogan's gotten really hardcore and is really awake.
[00:51:09.712 --> 00:51:11.772]  I told you three years ago, look for Rogan to get hardcore.
[00:51:11.792 --> 00:51:12.873]  He's gotten more and more hardcore.
[00:51:13.933 --> 00:51:14.733]  Because I know Joe.
[00:51:14.853 --> 00:51:15.994]  We hang out routinely.
[00:51:16.014 --> 00:51:17.034]  We talk almost every day.
[00:51:17.674 --> 00:51:18.515]  Joe's a great guy, 100% real.
[00:51:20.317 --> 00:51:23.000]  But it's just hard for him to believe the globalists are this evil.
[00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:23.900]  But he finally gets it.
[00:51:24.701 --> 00:51:29.745]  And I'll just tell you, in private, he's 100% on board.
[00:51:30.226 --> 00:51:32.267]  And I said you'd see that on air, and you are seeing it.
[00:51:32.368 --> 00:51:33.769]  So that's good news.
[00:51:33.789 --> 00:51:35.210]  It shows how far freedom's come.
[00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:41.876]  But the reason I raise that is, without even looking for these stories today, look what's in the news, okay?
[00:51:42.716 --> 00:51:44.057]  Because if I looked for this, I'd have 500 stories.
[00:51:47.794 --> 00:51:51.456]  Amazon bowed to White House pressure to conceal COVID books.
[00:51:52.377 --> 00:51:57.840]  Now documents have come out in the House Judiciary Committee in their weaponization hearings, the third round.
[00:51:59.781 --> 00:52:13.909]  The White House gave a list of thousands of books and publications they wanted either banned or non-searchable shadow banned, exposing the lab leak, exposing that it's going to function, and exposing the shots, which...
[00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:16.471]  Everything we said turned out to be true.
[00:52:17.251 --> 00:52:18.751]  Going after Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'
[00:52:18.731 --> 00:52:19.652]  's book that was number one.
[00:52:20.092 --> 00:52:22.393]  This is high-tech book burning, folks.
[00:52:24.074 --> 00:52:36.619]  Now, when you try to give sixth graders a book about if your neighbor wants to have sex with you in a tool shed, it actually is in one of the books, go ahead, it's fun, let the man have sex with you.
[00:52:37.939 --> 00:52:39.620]  So it's priming kids to be molested.
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:41.301]  That's the stuff...
[00:52:43.052 --> 00:52:48.075]  Now, us saying that's not in a children's library is not burning that book.
[00:52:49.856 --> 00:52:50.616]  The pedophile book.
[00:52:50.857 --> 00:52:51.757]  The pro-pedophile book.
[00:52:51.957 --> 00:52:52.558]  The grooming book.
[00:52:53.178 --> 00:52:55.399]  There's dozens of them that we know of that they have in the schools.
[00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:59.542]  Our own reporter, Christy Lee, she's been out because she had a baby.
[00:52:59.582 --> 00:53:00.242]  She'll be back soon.
[00:53:00.282 --> 00:53:00.742]  Great lady.
[00:53:02.023 --> 00:53:07.386]  She's got five kids now, but one of them is in seventh grade here in Austin.
[00:53:10.074 --> 00:53:11.034]  We're good to go.
[00:53:11.094 --> 00:53:11.634]  I think?
[00:53:35.492 --> 00:53:37.553]  So they turn them into these people that are abused.
[00:53:37.613 --> 00:53:40.035]  They get turned into these monsters like a vampire bites you.
[00:53:40.375 --> 00:53:40.996]  That's the metaphor.
[00:53:41.716 --> 00:53:42.837]  Some of them turn into that.
[00:53:43.878 --> 00:53:47.940]  So they spin that Republicans want to ban books.
[00:53:48.921 --> 00:53:49.161]  No.
[00:53:50.422 --> 00:53:53.204]  As long as it's not real children getting raped, you can put your book out.
[00:53:53.824 --> 00:53:54.564]  You're disgusting.
[00:53:54.605 --> 00:53:55.105]  You're gross.
[00:53:55.125 --> 00:53:55.645]  You're evil.
[00:53:56.025 --> 00:53:57.346]  But no, you're not going to show it to kids.
[00:53:57.847 --> 00:54:00.448]  But meanwhile, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'
[00:54:00.428 --> 00:54:03.150]  's book, The Real Anthony Fauci, well, that's in the documents.
[00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:04.251]  They had it suppressed.
[00:54:05.697 --> 00:54:06.397]  Didn't really work.
[00:54:06.417 --> 00:54:07.958]  I think it sold like 3 million copies.
[00:54:08.418 --> 00:54:16.660]  Continuing, WEF panelists suggest creating exclusion lists to demonetize sources sharing disinformation.
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:20.121]  And that's directly from the World Economic Forum that ended two weeks ago.
[00:54:20.621 --> 00:54:21.621]  And we've got the videos.
[00:54:21.661 --> 00:54:28.863]  They got up in the panel and they said, we will demonetize and go after your bank accounts of anybody that disagrees with anything we say.
[00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:30.390]  We're good to go.
[00:54:50.026 --> 00:54:50.887]  We're going to censor you.
[00:54:51.347 --> 00:54:52.728]  And on the list, it's hundreds of things.
[00:54:53.048 --> 00:54:54.849]  Did you criticize the Afghan withdrawal?
[00:54:55.249 --> 00:54:56.450]  Did you criticize the border?
[00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:57.671]  Did you criticize the lockdown?
[00:54:57.931 --> 00:54:59.392]  Did you criticize the vaccine?
[00:54:59.692 --> 00:55:01.353]  Did you criticize Black Lives Matter?
[00:55:01.613 --> 00:55:03.034]  Did you criticize transgenders?
[00:55:03.314 --> 00:55:04.115]  Did you criticize?
[00:55:04.155 --> 00:55:04.895]  Did you criticize?
[00:55:04.915 --> 00:55:05.656]  Did you criticize?
[00:55:05.676 --> 00:55:06.416]  Did you criticize?
[00:55:07.337 --> 00:55:16.662]  And then they just, bloop, demonetize you, shadow ban you, outright man you, take your bank account, have the CIA rig courts against you.
[00:55:16.702 --> 00:55:17.603]  And that's what happened to me.
[00:55:17.663 --> 00:55:19.084]  We now know that happened.
[00:55:21.307 --> 00:55:22.728]  And everybody's like, well, we feel sorry for you.
[00:55:22.748 --> 00:55:25.769]  I'm like, well, you better feel sorry for yourself, because they're coming after your ass next.
[00:55:27.309 --> 00:55:28.890]  They just take out the lead elephant, folks.
[00:55:29.650 --> 00:55:31.471]  But we're still kicking because of you supporting us.
[00:55:31.951 --> 00:55:35.892]  All right, I'm going to come back, air a special report that needs to be seen.
[00:55:36.353 --> 00:55:39.934]  We're going to get Michael Young in here, and I'm glad he brought Doc Chambers with him.
[00:55:40.954 --> 00:55:43.115]  And then, by the way, guys, give me Doc's bio.
[00:55:43.135 --> 00:55:45.156]  I know a lot about him, but I need the bio, please.
[00:55:45.196 --> 00:55:45.436]  Thank you.
[00:55:46.263 --> 00:55:47.484]  So I'm glad he brought him along.
[00:55:47.504 --> 00:55:50.385]  I was excited to see him as I was already trying to get him on the show.
[00:55:50.425 --> 00:55:51.986]  Big success with the border operation.
[00:55:52.026 --> 00:55:52.986]  Blew up in the left's face.
[00:55:53.286 --> 00:55:53.747]  Beautiful.
[00:55:54.227 --> 00:55:56.068]  Got a lot of inside stuff that happened.
[00:55:56.108 --> 00:55:57.688]  Provocateurs, they were able to stop.
[00:55:57.708 --> 00:56:05.512]  Some of these provocateurs, known leftists, professors, went down there and announced that we were down there beating up migrants and attacking people.
[00:56:06.913 --> 00:56:10.695]  They were shooting videos saying that, hoping leftists would come down and attack people.
[00:56:10.835 --> 00:56:11.675]  I wasn't even there.
[00:56:12.115 --> 00:56:13.136]  My reporters were down there.
[00:56:13.576 --> 00:56:15.337]  But again, that's their tool line.
[00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:17.021]  We're going to go to break.
[00:56:17.881 --> 00:56:19.743]  But folks, we're standing up for our rights.
[00:56:19.763 --> 00:56:20.844]  We're standing up for your rights.
[00:56:20.884 --> 00:56:23.266]  We're standing up for all of our freedoms and our children.
[00:56:23.486 --> 00:56:31.133]  If you don't spread the word about the broadcast, if you don't share the links, if you don't buy products at Infowarsstore.com, then I'm not griping at you.
[00:56:31.153 --> 00:56:32.254]  I'm just saying, what are you doing?
[00:56:33.335 --> 00:56:36.637]  Less than 1% of you ever buy a product at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:56:37.529 --> 00:56:44.512]  If just a half a percent more would go buy a book or a film or a t-shirt or get some of our right supplements and then reorder them because they really work.
[00:56:44.832 --> 00:56:45.432]  Just try it.
[00:56:46.032 --> 00:56:47.973]  We would be able to do so many things.
[00:56:48.353 --> 00:56:52.115]  I'm praying to God that he'll touch your heart to decide to support us.
[00:56:52.655 --> 00:56:53.895]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:56:56.596 --> 00:56:57.197]  It's been sold out.
[00:56:57.237 --> 00:56:58.038]  It's back in stock.
[00:56:58.098 --> 00:56:59.259]  Reformulated even stronger.
[00:56:59.279 --> 00:57:01.943]  Nitric boost to clean out your blood and your whole body.
[00:57:02.403 --> 00:57:03.485]  Vasodilation.
[00:57:04.146 --> 00:57:05.868]  It's got a lot of wonderful side effects.
[00:57:05.908 --> 00:57:06.629]  And I mean good ones.
[00:57:06.989 --> 00:57:07.730]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:57:08.592 --> 00:57:09.353]  Especially for men.
[00:57:09.973 --> 00:57:11.354]  You need Nitric Boost.
[00:57:11.575 --> 00:57:16.319]  Infowarsstore.com because we got a bigger manufacturer, even higher quality.
[00:57:17.139 --> 00:57:18.080]  It's 40% off.
[00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:18.981]  We can never offer that.
[00:57:19.221 --> 00:57:20.122]  We're selling out quick.
[00:57:20.142 --> 00:57:22.023]  You can get next level foundational energy.
[00:57:22.043 --> 00:57:23.965]  I'm not going to belabor what's in it.
[00:57:24.025 --> 00:57:25.406]  You just need to go research what's in it.
[00:57:25.446 --> 00:57:26.507]  This is very special.
[00:57:27.028 --> 00:57:28.229]  Next level foundational energy.
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:31.462]  It is powerful, so be careful with it.
[00:57:31.823 --> 00:57:37.910]  Next level foundational energy, InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.

[00:59:32.745 --> 00:59:38.988]  Which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees, who used it for its relaxing qualities.

[01:00:13.388 --> 01:00:20.012]  We pledge allegiance to Comrade Putin and his great minion, Donald J. Trump, to make America great again.
[01:00:20.352 --> 01:00:26.776]  We pledge this plan to destroy the Americans, to save their economy, and their people, and their border, and their military.
[01:00:26.796 --> 01:00:27.877]  Hail Putin!
[01:00:28.077 --> 01:00:28.878]  Hail Russia!
[01:00:29.078 --> 01:00:30.218]  We will never surrender!
[01:00:30.319 --> 01:00:33.480]  Yes, that is the KGB plan!
[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:34.341]  Well done, Comrade!
[01:00:34.401 --> 01:00:36.082]  We sell the Americans!
[01:00:46.462 --> 01:00:47.443]  You do it, keep the oil.
[01:00:47.543 --> 01:00:49.404]  Would you still send aid to Israel right now?
[01:00:50.145 --> 01:00:52.666]  Look, we've always got to protect Israel, in my opinion.
[01:00:54.668 --> 01:00:56.449]  They're amazing people, what they've done.
[01:00:56.889 --> 01:00:59.771]  It's an amazing thing, and they've been loyal to us.
[01:00:59.851 --> 01:01:01.933]  Mr. President, when will you announce who your VP is?
[01:01:02.773 --> 01:01:03.434]  Not for a while.
[01:01:03.454 --> 01:01:06.856]  We have so many great people in the Republican Party, but not for a while.
[01:01:07.253 --> 01:01:10.275]  What criteria are you using to identify who your running mate is?
[01:01:10.555 --> 01:01:11.936]  Always it's got to be one thing.
[01:01:11.996 --> 01:01:13.477]  It's got to be who would be a good president.
[01:01:13.557 --> 01:01:17.539]  I mean, you always have to think that because, you know, in cases of emergency, things happen, right?
[01:01:17.659 --> 01:01:19.080]  No matter who you are, things happen.
[01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:20.441]  It's got to be number one.
[01:01:20.541 --> 01:01:21.321]  Who is your running mate?
[01:01:21.942 --> 01:01:23.102]  Well, I have a lot of good people.
[01:01:23.202 --> 01:01:24.463]  We have a lot of really good people.
[01:01:24.483 --> 01:01:25.564]  So you haven't decided who it is?
[01:01:26.411 --> 01:01:31.752]  I have a lot of good ideas, but I haven't... So you haven't told that person, you're my person?
[01:01:31.872 --> 01:01:32.753]  I speak to everybody.
[01:01:33.073 --> 01:01:33.913]  I speak to everybody.
[01:01:33.933 --> 01:01:37.554]  You know, I called Tim Scott this week, because a lot of people like Tim Scott.
[01:01:37.654 --> 01:01:42.255]  I called him and I said, you're a much better candidate for me than you are for yourself.
[01:01:42.915 --> 01:01:47.136]  When I watched him, he was fine, he was good, but he was very low-key, etc., etc.
[01:01:47.556 --> 01:01:51.697]  I watched him in the last week, defending me and sticking up for me and fighting for me.
[01:01:51.717 --> 01:01:54.738]  I said, man, you're a much better...
[01:01:55.518 --> 01:01:56.999]  Well, it could be a lot of people.
[01:01:57.019 --> 01:01:57.599]  But it was interesting.
[01:01:57.619 --> 01:01:58.459]  I was watching Tim.
[01:01:58.519 --> 01:02:00.560]  I've been watching, you know, for a while.
[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:02.900]  I watched him campaign as a candidate.
[01:02:17.515 --> 01:02:19.237]  But I watched him over the last two weeks.
[01:02:19.717 --> 01:02:22.780]  As you know, he endorsed me, fully endorsed me, gave me a beautiful endorsement.
[01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:26.723]  And he has been really strong in terms of that.
[01:02:27.124 --> 01:02:31.988]  No, but that has nothing to do, I don't want anybody to take even any inference, but it's incredible.
[01:02:32.568 --> 01:02:35.791]  Kristi Noem has been incredible fighting for me.
[01:02:35.871 --> 01:02:38.173]  She said I'd never run against him because I can't beat him.
[01:02:38.494 --> 01:02:39.875]  That was a very nice thing to say.
[01:02:40.095 --> 01:02:42.657]  What was the story that your team reached out to RFK Jr.? ?
[01:02:43.718 --> 01:02:44.498]  It's a false story, no.
[01:02:44.518 --> 01:02:45.039]  It's a false story.
[01:02:45.099 --> 01:02:46.359]  You never reached out to our officials?
[01:02:46.399 --> 01:02:46.760]  You know what?
[01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:47.380]  I like them a lot.
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:47.500]  Nope.
[01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:48.521]  Never happened.
[01:02:48.621 --> 01:02:53.623]  Is it fair to believe that you would have a number of your former officials in your new cabinet?
[01:02:53.743 --> 01:02:54.484]  I will put some back.
[01:02:54.504 --> 01:02:54.964]  I'll tell you.
[01:02:55.504 --> 01:02:55.784]  You did.
[01:02:55.924 --> 01:02:57.245]  I want to go back to immigration.
[01:02:57.725 --> 01:03:06.450]  Walk us through your plan for immigration, because is it as easy as going back to the security that you had in place, like the remain in Mexico and all these other things that Joe Biden overturned?
[01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:11.512]  There are 8 to 10 million illegals in the country right now on Joe Biden's watch.
[01:03:11.572 --> 01:03:12.653]  So what do you do with them?
[01:03:12.813 --> 01:03:13.673]  Are you going to deport them all?
[01:03:13.693 --> 01:03:14.094]  What's the plan?
[01:03:14.114 --> 01:03:15.374]  Well, you're going to have to deport a lot of them.
[01:03:15.674 --> 01:03:16.735]  It's not sustainable.
[01:03:17.475 --> 01:03:18.155]  And now you look.
[01:03:18.336 --> 01:03:19.856]  Look, these countries are very smart.
[01:03:19.896 --> 01:03:22.758]  I know every one of the leaders of the countries, for the most part.
[01:03:23.938 --> 01:03:26.219]  The presidents, the dictators, I know them all.
[01:03:26.419 --> 01:03:28.080]  I know the kings, the queens, I know them all.
[01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:29.521]  These are smart people.
[01:03:29.541 --> 01:03:30.781]  These are streetwise people.
[01:03:31.321 --> 01:03:36.024]  It makes sense that they're taking people out and sending them up in caravans to the United States.
[01:03:36.084 --> 01:03:37.444]  And it's not just South America.
[01:03:37.464 --> 01:03:39.965]  It's from Africa, from Asia, from all over the world.
[01:03:40.005 --> 01:03:40.826]  And China and Asia.
[01:03:40.846 --> 01:03:40.946]  Yeah.
[01:03:41.326 --> 01:03:42.466]  I mean, from all over the world.
[01:03:42.526 --> 01:03:46.168]  From China, they had 28,000 people in the last few months.
[01:03:46.188 --> 01:03:46.168]  28,000.
[01:03:46.488 --> 01:03:46.968]  What's he doing?
[01:03:46.988 --> 01:03:47.648]  Building an army?
[01:03:47.668 --> 01:03:51.770]  And they were mostly men, almost all men, from the age of 18 to 25.
[01:03:52.310 --> 01:03:53.170]  So what's that all about?
[01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:55.111]  But are you talking about mass deportation?
[01:03:55.211 --> 01:03:57.432]  What do you do with the 8 to 10 million people already here?
[01:03:57.492 --> 01:03:57.992]  Okay.
[01:03:58.112 --> 01:04:02.334]  Dwight Eisenhower, believe it or not, you don't think of him as being a tough president or a great president.
[01:04:02.354 --> 01:04:03.674]  He was actually a very good president.
[01:04:03.714 --> 01:04:07.936]  He was very strong on deportation because a lot of people were coming into our country illegally.
[01:04:08.857 --> 01:04:10.959]  And he started a big mass deportation.
[01:04:11.359 --> 01:04:13.901]  He dropped them very close to the border and they came back.
[01:04:14.221 --> 01:04:16.723]  Then he dropped them 2,000 miles away and they didn't come back.
[01:04:17.583 --> 01:04:27.410]  We cannot allow scenes like I saw in New York two days ago where policemen are being beat up by gangs of illegal immigrants, in that case from Venezuela, Honduras.
[01:04:28.211 --> 01:04:29.031]  We can't allow that.
[01:04:29.111 --> 01:04:30.272]  And these are kids that are fighters.
[01:04:30.312 --> 01:04:31.592]  They were not, you know, babies.
[01:04:31.652 --> 01:04:34.273]  They were knocking the hell out of our policemen.
[01:04:34.933 --> 01:04:36.113]  We can't let this happen.
[01:04:36.533 --> 01:04:37.533]  These are tough people.
[01:04:38.033 --> 01:04:40.514]  So the heads of these countries are smart.
[01:04:40.854 --> 01:04:45.075]  They're not sending the people that are doing a great job and that they love in the country.
[01:04:45.435 --> 01:04:48.276]  They're sending people, for the most part, that they don't want.
[01:04:48.356 --> 01:04:50.477]  And they're putting them into caravans.
[01:04:50.557 --> 01:04:52.097]  All right, folks, we're going to break.
[01:04:52.117 --> 01:04:53.157]  For one minute.
[01:04:53.977 --> 01:04:55.678]  And then Michael Young's studio, huge news.
[01:05:00.342 --> 01:05:02.903]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalist.
[01:05:03.263 --> 01:05:05.624]  And people can't identify who's a patriot and who isn't.
[01:05:05.944 --> 01:05:09.085]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalist.
[01:05:09.145 --> 01:05:12.066]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.
[01:05:12.306 --> 01:05:22.889]  That's why I designed this amazing 1776 red, white, and blue Gadsden flag shirt so you can support the Infowar and meet like-minded people everywhere when you wear it.
[01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:28.635]  When you wear these shirts, it creates an amazing amount of energy, and it's quite the adventure.

[01:06:05.297 --> 01:06:10.280]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:12.962 --> 01:06:20.026]  Well, Michael Yon was a Green Beret stationed around the world, also an expert on Russia, and trained to fight the war with Russia.
[01:06:21.458 --> 01:06:22.459]  We're good to go.
[01:06:39.693 --> 01:06:40.173]  We're good to go.
[01:06:40.193 --> 01:06:40.914]  We're good to go.
[01:06:41.274 --> 01:06:41.874]  We're good to go.
[01:07:09.605 --> 01:07:18.977]  Now he comes out yesterday and signs an order to sell our coal that he won't allow to be burned here to India to build factories there.
[01:07:20.097 --> 01:07:23.758]  We've got articles up on Infowars.com that deal with all of that.
[01:07:24.278 --> 01:07:25.578]  So that's strategic.
[01:07:26.099 --> 01:07:30.260]  Energy is the food of the machines and the infrastructure that feeds us.
[01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:32.100]  So it's just like cutting food off.
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.221]  They're cutting the farmers off.
[01:07:34.001 --> 01:07:40.202]  Michael Young's done a lot of reporting the last few years, in the last few months, in the Netherlands.
[01:07:40.363 --> 01:07:49.085]  Now the trucking and farming protests have spread all over Europe because they're literally saying we're cutting off your fuel,
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:54.744]  We're putting more taxes on you and we're cutting off your fertilizer.
[01:07:55.044 --> 01:07:56.325]  They are cutting the food off.
[01:07:56.706 --> 01:08:01.610]  They are cutting the energy off and saying business is only open in China and India.
[01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:03.112]  And I'm not against the Indians, folks.
[01:08:03.712 --> 01:08:04.753]  And I'm not against the Chinese people.
[01:08:04.793 --> 01:08:06.155]  But this is beyond treason.
[01:08:06.375 --> 01:08:08.817]  And the average person doesn't think, where's power come from?
[01:08:08.837 --> 01:08:10.078]  You just flip a light switch.
[01:08:10.118 --> 01:08:10.659]  No, it doesn't.
[01:08:11.937 --> 01:08:12.417]  We're good to go.
[01:08:12.437 --> 01:08:12.617]  I think?
[01:08:31.247 --> 01:08:31.647]  We're good to go.
[01:08:54.241 --> 01:08:54.802]  We're good to go.
[01:09:10.464 --> 01:09:11.084]  We're good to go.
[01:09:31.798 --> 01:09:36.341]  You've been down there for years and the people backing you have really been on the right horse.
[01:09:36.881 --> 01:09:43.386]  You have won a major strategic victory in the awakening process to cut off the funds.
[01:09:43.426 --> 01:09:46.668]  You've got to feel really some satisfaction right now.
[01:09:47.868 --> 01:09:48.429]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:09:48.449 --> 01:09:49.370]  Yeah, I just got back.
[01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:53.473]  I just took our team, Operation Burning Edge, just with Ann VanderSteel.
[01:09:53.514 --> 01:09:58.158]  We just took Brett Weinstein and Dr. Chris Martinson down to the Darien Gap.
[01:09:59.219 --> 01:10:02.802]  And then we took, well, Ann VanderSteel was there, Masako Ganaha from Japan.
[01:10:03.323 --> 01:10:05.945]  And this has now reached millions of viewers.
[01:10:06.065 --> 01:10:09.449]  Just the Tucker interview with Brett Weinstein hit at least 9 million now.
[01:10:10.009 --> 01:10:10.950]  I think we're good to go.
[01:10:34.309 --> 01:10:36.492]  Natural gas is something we've talked about quite a lot.
[01:10:53.032 --> 01:10:57.294]  The natural gas, last year in March, I was at the Dutch elections.
[01:10:57.874 --> 01:11:03.616]  In fact, I had just left Panama and went straight to Netherlands because Netherlands is another vital terrain.
[01:11:04.376 --> 01:11:09.478]  I was at Groningen gas fields, which is the biggest gas fields in Europe, actually.
[01:11:09.938 --> 01:11:14.840]  And I was warning, due to information war, they might close the Groningen gas fields.
[01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:16.580]  And now they have.
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:21.222]  Now, when I reported that last March... It sounded crazy.
[01:11:21.562 --> 01:11:24.924]  Yeah, because you've got to keep in mind... Oh, so they're turning the lights off.
[01:11:25.584 --> 01:11:27.065]  It just takes time for you to figure it out.
[01:11:27.245 --> 01:11:30.727]  The flash to bang can be quite long on, for instance, the natural gas.
[01:11:30.767 --> 01:11:33.989]  Keep in mind with the natural gas, it's more than just keeping your water warm.
[01:11:34.309 --> 01:11:35.470]  It's also fertilizer.
[01:11:35.770 --> 01:11:43.675]  In the Haber-Bosch process, in which you take the natural gas and you remove the hydrogen and you combine it with the nitrogen that we breathe, you make ammonia, right?
[01:11:44.295 --> 01:11:47.957]  Nitrogen is fertilizer, such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, and that sort of thing.
[01:11:48.998 --> 01:11:50.379]  So they've turned off...
[01:11:50.939 --> 01:11:53.701]  The second largest food-producing country in the world is the Netherlands.
[01:11:53.721 --> 01:11:54.401]  They're geniuses.
[01:11:54.421 --> 01:11:57.343]  They're the central green thumb.
[01:11:57.643 --> 01:11:59.624]  They literally are cutting off the main food.
[01:12:00.265 --> 01:12:00.805]  Absolutely.
[01:12:01.265 --> 01:12:02.346]  And Germany as well.
[01:12:02.446 --> 01:12:04.947]  And in Germany, they talk about carbon dioxide.
[01:12:05.268 --> 01:12:08.329]  In Netherlands, it's about stikstof, which is nitrogen, right?
[01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:14.693]  So they custom-make these information campaigns depending on the demographic and how it will sell.
[01:12:14.733 --> 01:12:17.775]  A lot of people don't realize they're not just cutting off farmers.
[01:12:18.035 --> 01:12:19.356]  They're cutting off fishermen as well.
[01:12:19.736 --> 01:12:23.339]  Well, when you cut off farmers, you cut yourself off.
[01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:24.400]  Absolutely.
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:28.864]  And you'll put the control in the hands of people like Bill Gates, who is openly open.
[01:12:28.884 --> 01:12:30.385]  He doesn't hide what he's doing.
[01:12:30.626 --> 01:12:33.588]  He's trying to get as much control over the food supply as possible.
[01:12:33.909 --> 01:12:34.589]  He's just one.
[01:12:34.929 --> 01:12:36.651]  Keep in mind, the World Economic Forum...
[01:12:38.032 --> 01:12:38.292]  Oh, yeah.
[01:12:38.673 --> 01:12:50.087]  Now, keep in mind, now, as they shut off the food supplies, bit by bit, keep in mind, again, there's a long flash to bang between the reduction of the nitrogenous fertilizer production, the food prices going up.
[01:12:50.107 --> 01:12:51.769]  You use the military terms, long fuse.
[01:12:52.109 --> 01:12:53.091]  Right, exactly.
[01:12:53.371 --> 01:12:53.892]  So the...
[01:12:55.312 --> 01:13:00.435]  The human osmotic pressure, the hop, the human osmotic pressure is the push and the pull of migration.
[01:13:00.835 --> 01:13:07.979]  Now as the food prices go up, food shortages increase, and other pressures, positive pressures increase, that causes people to move.
[01:13:08.359 --> 01:13:17.403]  Meanwhile, you've got the NGOs, many, more than 250, who are facilitating the invasions of Europe and the United States.
[01:13:17.423 --> 01:13:19.044]  And don't you love Elon calling for their arrest?
[01:13:19.064 --> 01:13:20.305]  Because they are human trafficking.
[01:13:21.085 --> 01:13:22.686]  And Biden can't waive a law on that.
[01:13:23.911 --> 01:13:24.271]  All right.
[01:13:24.352 --> 01:13:31.339]  You know, one of the reasons Operation Burning Edge spent so much time at SpaceX last year was to specifically to spur Elon.
[01:13:31.359 --> 01:13:32.880]  We didn't even ask to talk with him.
[01:13:33.181 --> 01:13:39.167]  We didn't ask to talk with any of the... I'm very pro-SpaceX, by the way, and I have been since the inception.
[01:13:39.547 --> 01:13:46.034]  But we went to SpaceX, spent two or three weeks down there showing how the aliens are coming across the border at Boca Chica.
[01:13:46.254 --> 01:13:46.474]  I think.
[01:14:13.232 --> 01:14:14.253]  That's what we have to do.
[01:14:14.333 --> 01:14:19.396]  Well, I was never in the military, but I did get really interested in politics and how to defeat the globalists.
[01:14:19.776 --> 01:14:28.761]  So when I was like 20, I started reading all the books about resistance movements, both from the West and communists and others, and things like total resistance.
[01:14:29.302 --> 01:14:30.062]  And it's all right there.
[01:14:30.122 --> 01:14:30.723]  That's what we need.
[01:14:31.383 --> 01:14:32.764]  We have to force multiply.
[01:14:33.084 --> 01:14:36.326]  We have to put your ego into a box.
[01:14:36.346 --> 01:14:42.611]  You have to have a strong ego to attack the way we do, to fight every day, to wake up and go to bed in the game.
[01:14:43.031 --> 01:14:46.473]  But you also... But you externalize your ego onto humanity.
[01:14:46.833 --> 01:14:47.414]  Exactly.
[01:14:47.714 --> 01:14:49.215]  You need to do exactly what you do.
[01:14:49.335 --> 01:14:51.917]  For instance, you're always giving the microphone to other people.
[01:14:52.297 --> 01:14:55.139]  You know, when I say, hey, can you have so-and-so on, you immediately do it.
[01:14:55.419 --> 01:14:56.500]  It's extremely helpful.
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:01.043]  Like, for instance, now there's some... You have a lot of Orthodox Jews watch your show, by the way.
[01:15:02.184 --> 01:15:05.768]  And the Jews are worried about all the Islamists they're bringing in.
[01:15:18.203 --> 01:15:19.184]  Oh, yeah, big time.
[01:15:19.244 --> 01:15:22.608]  The real Jews, the Orthodox Jews, they'll be watching right now.
[01:15:22.628 --> 01:15:24.590]  They'll be sending me 100 messages when I get off.
[01:15:25.090 --> 01:15:30.015]  And they really want to put a kibosh on HIAS.
[01:15:30.095 --> 01:15:35.241]  Keep in mind, there's Catholic Charities, Lutheran Immigrant, Refugee Immigrant Services, and all these others.
[01:15:35.441 --> 01:15:36.182]  That's a good question.
[01:15:36.222 --> 01:15:37.083]  What's the biggest NGO?
[01:15:37.103 --> 01:15:38.164]  You're saying it's the Jewish one.
[01:15:39.004 --> 01:15:44.889]  The biggest one would be IOM, the International Organization for Migration.
[01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:46.430]  That's the umbrella group.
[01:15:46.650 --> 01:15:49.232]  Right, that's the main engine room, you might say.
[01:15:49.252 --> 01:15:51.114]  I'm in the little front groups.
[01:15:52.074 --> 01:15:55.937]  Arguably, it might be Catholic Charities, but it's hard to figure this out.
[01:15:56.017 --> 01:16:00.721]  We work on it all the time, but HIAS is quite huge, and HIAS is quite influential.
[01:16:01.241 --> 01:16:06.524]  Keep in mind, Mayorkas, Alex Mayorkas, was a Cuban refugee himself, right?
[01:16:07.005 --> 01:16:08.906]  And he... And he brought his communism here.
[01:16:09.186 --> 01:16:09.826]  Oh, big time.
[01:16:10.247 --> 01:16:14.249]  And, you know, the other day he threw the Holocaust card during his impeachment hearings and whatnot.
[01:16:14.589 --> 01:16:19.912]  You know, the bottom line is all of us came from families who have been in pandemic, famine, wars, and genocides.
[01:16:20.052 --> 01:16:24.815]  Every single buddy watching... Everybody on Earth is now a victim of a bio-attack with COVID.
[01:16:24.915 --> 01:16:25.596]  I mean, you know...
[01:16:26.036 --> 01:16:27.857]  I'm as big a victim as you is, Mayorkas.
[01:16:27.917 --> 01:16:29.018]  I'm sticking up your ass.
[01:16:29.058 --> 01:16:29.659]  Exactly.
[01:16:29.839 --> 01:16:30.319]  Exactly.
[01:16:30.359 --> 01:16:30.899]  Thank you, sir.
[01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:41.887]  And Mayorkas, keep in mind, if you go to highest.org, Mayorkas, they congratulate, you know, Mayorkas was a board member on highest.
[01:16:42.327 --> 01:16:50.553]  And their camp down in Darien Province in Panama is about 40 yards away from the main gate of China Camp.
[01:16:50.613 --> 01:16:51.793]  I'm down there all the time.
[01:16:52.094 --> 01:16:55.636]  I was just down there three weeks ago with Brett Weinstein and Chris Martinson out
[01:16:55.936 --> 01:17:09.305]  By the way, to interrupt you, I love the national media picked up when you were in Dripping Springs a week ago before you guys went down the super successful convoy, caravan, and they spun it like you were anti-Semitic because you were telling the whole story.
[01:17:09.325 --> 01:17:15.288]  They took out a context that Orthodox Jews see massive Islamic Hezbollah Hamas being brought in.
[01:17:15.308 --> 01:17:18.230]  They're concerned about Jewish charities being used for that.
[01:17:18.570 --> 01:17:20.912]  You were saying, look out, Jews, this is happening.
[01:17:20.932 --> 01:17:22.453]  They spun that that you're anti-Jew.
[01:17:22.933 --> 01:17:31.397]  Oh, exactly, because I'm saying, like with Catholic Charities, if the Pope doesn't denounce, eventually doesn't denounce Catholic Charities, eventually he's just accepting ownership, right?
[01:17:31.918 --> 01:17:33.438]  And it's the same with HIAS.
[01:17:33.859 --> 01:17:38.901]  If you look on HIAS.org, you'll see a long list of people that are donors to HIAS, right?
[01:17:39.221 --> 01:17:40.382]  Ben Shapiro is on there.
[01:17:40.902 --> 01:17:43.423]  I'm not saying it's the Ben Shapiro of Daily Wire.
[01:17:43.483 --> 01:17:44.504]  He has denied that.
[01:17:44.924 --> 01:17:50.950]  But there are nine Shapiros on there, and you can see many different names on there, Pritzker and whatnot.
[01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:58.697]  Why are they openly donating to HIAS, who is... Hespela is coming through the border every single day, right?
[01:17:58.957 --> 01:18:05.603]  There is a huge... Listen, in 1994, there was a Hespela bombing in Panama that killed about 12 Jews.
[01:18:05.643 --> 01:18:08.966]  I just had lunch with one of the family members a couple months ago in Panama.
[01:18:09.286 --> 01:18:10.447]  Let me ask you that.
[01:18:12.877 --> 01:18:19.043]  Brett Weinstein, really smart guy, said you're right, told Tucker, this is a military invasion, Chinese military-age males.
[01:18:19.403 --> 01:18:21.085]  What are they planning with all these sleeper cells?
[01:18:21.845 --> 01:18:23.067]  Well, there's different ecosystems.
[01:18:23.127 --> 01:18:29.072]  Of course, China, you know, again, I've written three books on Chinese information where, unfortunately, they're only in Japanese.
[01:18:29.092 --> 01:18:32.515]  They're not in English because I've been working to wake up Japan for years.
[01:18:32.976 --> 01:18:35.238]  But different ecosystems have different goals.
[01:18:35.658 --> 01:18:36.138]  We're good to go.
[01:18:36.158 --> 01:18:36.519]  We're good to go.
[01:18:57.228 --> 01:18:58.970]  Oh, yeah, and they did the same with Hong Kong.
[01:18:58.990 --> 01:19:02.774]  For instance, I was in Hong Kong for seven months until they kicked me out in 2020, right?
[01:19:03.075 --> 01:19:05.257]  You can see them put me on the airplane and shutting the door.
[01:19:05.277 --> 01:19:07.199]  Google it, right?
[01:19:07.259 --> 01:19:08.601]  Or web search it, let's say.
[01:19:09.262 --> 01:19:10.523]  But what did they do to Hong Kong?
[01:19:10.723 --> 01:19:11.664]  They took Hong Kong...
[01:19:12.145 --> 01:19:14.606]  Drip, drip, drip, demographic warfare.
[01:19:14.646 --> 01:19:24.451]  They were bringing in mainland Chinese every day at a rate that nobody really got crazy about, but at a rate that they ended up taking over the professorships.
[01:19:24.811 --> 01:19:27.092]  They became school teachers teaching history.
[01:19:27.392 --> 01:19:29.373]  They became policemen and politicians.
[01:19:29.774 --> 01:19:31.554]  The normal who's who in the zoo.
[01:19:31.594 --> 01:19:32.675]  Classic infiltration.
[01:19:32.975 --> 01:19:33.255]  Yep.
[01:19:33.415 --> 01:19:34.576]  And they did it with Hong Kong.
[01:19:35.036 --> 01:19:36.777]  And they're doing it right now with Taiwan.
[01:19:37.117 --> 01:19:40.880]  And I'm telling you, just a few months ago, I was in Belize.
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:44.682]  I met with a Taiwanese ambassador there with Masako Ganaha.
[01:19:44.702 --> 01:19:45.582]  I was interviewing her.
[01:19:46.063 --> 01:19:52.546]  And you can see, bit by bit, that Taiwan is being edged out everywhere.
[01:19:52.907 --> 01:19:55.008]  For instance, in Hong Kong.
[01:19:55.448 --> 01:19:57.950]  Here's an interesting aside, or it's related.
[01:19:58.571 --> 01:20:04.956]  IOM, the International Organization for Migration, they are the huge engine of the invasion, right?
[01:20:05.336 --> 01:20:12.022]  They have taken over the number one office space in Panama, in the City of Knowledge, which used to be Fort Clayton, the U.S.
[01:20:12.102 --> 01:20:13.103]  Army South.
[01:20:13.123 --> 01:20:15.985]  So this UN-CHICOM thing has taken over our military base.
[01:20:16.045 --> 01:20:16.205]  Right.
[01:20:16.586 --> 01:20:20.789]  The three major donors of IOM are United States, that's number one.
[01:20:20.829 --> 01:20:21.710]  Number two is Germany.
[01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:23.051]  Number three is Canada.
[01:20:23.131 --> 01:20:23.251]  Right.
[01:20:23.371 --> 01:20:35.033]  Now, in Guatemala, I'm sorry, in Honduras, the IOM is now sharing the office space with the Canadian embassy, right?
[01:20:36.374 --> 01:20:39.494]  You're great at giving us all the details, but you've done your job now.
[01:20:39.554 --> 01:20:41.055]  People know there's UN camps.
[01:20:41.075 --> 01:20:42.015]  They know we're funding it.
[01:20:42.635 --> 01:20:44.595]  Now we've got to move to cut the funding.
[01:20:44.615 --> 01:20:50.336]  Like this new bill, $2.3 million to the NGOs, a lot of Republicans supporting it.
[01:20:50.637 --> 01:20:51.557]  This is so simple.
[01:20:51.657 --> 01:20:52.837]  Cut the damn funding off.
[01:20:53.257 --> 01:20:53.437]  Right.
[01:20:53.537 --> 01:20:55.940]  Cut the funding will be the first major hit.
[01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:58.882]  I mean, for instance, cutting the funding to all of you in.
[01:20:59.563 --> 01:21:02.265]  You know, years ago, people said... I said get the hell out of the whole thing.
[01:21:02.545 --> 01:21:04.027]  Yeah, totally out.
[01:21:04.607 --> 01:21:08.751]  Cut everything and start arresting people who are involved in the child trafficking.
[01:21:09.011 --> 01:21:10.992]  We know a lot of people... And the NGOs are.
[01:21:11.012 --> 01:21:11.772]  That's what I said.
[01:21:11.792 --> 01:21:13.232]  The state police and others are looking at that.
[01:21:13.632 --> 01:21:14.353]  They can get them.
[01:21:14.373 --> 01:21:16.433]  Because it doesn't matter if Biden says he can come through illegally.
[01:21:16.773 --> 01:21:21.335]  You're there with unaccompanied minors that are being trafficked to people and all sorts of crimes being committed.
[01:21:21.395 --> 01:21:24.536]  You start arresting a few of these people, they'll fold like a...
[01:21:25.356 --> 01:21:26.457]  Old barn in a tornado.
[01:21:26.777 --> 01:21:27.738]  Oh, yeah, exactly.
[01:21:28.039 --> 01:21:29.300]  And we know a lot of their names.
[01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:30.681]  We know thousands of their names.
[01:21:31.442 --> 01:21:36.907]  I mean, they should be kicking down the doors in Texas of these facilities, such as in Brownsville, the old Walmart.
[01:21:36.927 --> 01:21:39.049]  And you can get them on zoning.
[01:21:39.129 --> 01:21:40.971]  There's a thousand ways to skin this cat.
[01:21:42.537 --> 01:21:43.818]  It's not like we're hoarding it.
[01:22:09.838 --> 01:22:12.940]  And I played a video yesterday that was sent to me by Border Patrol.
[01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:17.823]  The Border Patrol starts crying because they've seen these kids before and they're begging for help.
[01:22:18.464 --> 01:22:21.386]  And they have to hand them over to the NGOs again and see them a month later.
[01:22:22.226 --> 01:22:22.687]  Exactly.
[01:22:23.767 --> 01:22:25.028]  Find that B-roll guy and show that.
[01:22:25.048 --> 01:22:25.869]  I mean, this is sick.
[01:22:27.513 --> 01:22:28.373]  I'm telling the crew, keep going.
[01:22:28.673 --> 01:22:29.294]  Okay, right.
[01:22:29.674 --> 01:22:33.157]  Yeah, and so this is happening openly, and it happens all throughout the world.
[01:22:33.517 --> 01:22:38.801]  I mean, we see people coming in through the Darien Gap with children that don't look like they're even the same race.
[01:22:38.861 --> 01:22:41.123]  I mean, where do they even get these children, right?
[01:22:41.203 --> 01:22:43.485]  They use them as a golden ticket to get in.
[01:22:44.105 --> 01:22:48.487]  Exactly, and in some cases, we know they recycle children on the Mexico-U.S.
[01:22:48.527 --> 01:22:49.287]  border, right?
[01:22:49.327 --> 01:22:52.588]  They'll literally use the child to get in and recycle the child.
[01:22:52.608 --> 01:23:01.512]  That's what the Border Patrol was telling us is why they're so freaked out, why they were giving us all this intel, is they said, no, we see some of these kids every month, and they tell us, we've been raped, help us, and they can't.
[01:23:01.892 --> 01:23:03.012]  They're ordered to hand them over.
[01:23:03.272 --> 01:23:04.693]  The Border Patrol starts crying right here.
[01:23:04.873 --> 01:23:05.453]  This is the video.
[01:23:05.873 --> 01:23:06.233]  Keep going.
[01:23:07.534 --> 01:23:08.874]  Yeah, this is just over the top.
[01:23:08.894 --> 01:23:09.875]  I mean, this is, you know...
[01:23:11.826 --> 01:23:14.708]  I was stationed in Germany when I was in the Army, in the U.S.
[01:23:14.788 --> 01:23:21.473]  Army, and we often wonder, how is it that these normal farmers and whatnot became these beasts that ran the camps and whatnot?
[01:23:21.913 --> 01:23:23.254]  And now I understand.
[01:23:23.635 --> 01:23:25.816]  It's everybody just doing their job, sir.
[01:23:25.836 --> 01:23:26.757]  Keeping their head down.
[01:23:27.978 --> 01:23:40.946]  Yeah, you know, one recently passed away Army Colonel Al Johnson told me one time, we were talking all day into the night one time, he said, Michael, organizational structure dictates outcome.
[01:23:41.346 --> 01:23:44.008]  Organizational structure dictates outcome, right?
[01:23:44.568 --> 01:23:48.330]  Bottom line, like a clock is a mechanical organizational structure.
[01:23:48.710 --> 01:23:51.832]  All these people at Border Patrol and whatnot, they're gears in the clock.
[01:23:52.032 --> 01:23:54.594]  They don't even know what time it is, but their job is to...
[01:23:55.114 --> 01:23:57.097]  Click, click, click, put people on the bus.
[01:23:57.337 --> 01:24:03.345]  The bus driver's job is click, click, click, drive them to wherever, and the next thing you know, they're on the streets of America.
[01:24:04.206 --> 01:24:06.408]  And it's our job to cut the funding off.
[01:24:06.468 --> 01:24:08.231]  It's our government, our Border Patrol.
[01:24:08.591 --> 01:24:09.512]  We're blaming them.
[01:24:09.753 --> 01:24:11.415]  It's our fault for not stopping it.
[01:24:11.695 --> 01:24:12.696]  We have to stop it!
[01:24:13.357 --> 01:24:13.817]  That's right.
[01:24:13.897 --> 01:24:15.078]  That's why we're out here doing it.
[01:24:15.118 --> 01:24:17.580]  That's why we're putting the laser on highest.
[01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:21.883]  Highest Catholic charities, Lutheran Refugee Services, IOM.
[01:24:22.063 --> 01:24:23.024]  We know who they are.
[01:24:23.104 --> 01:24:24.625]  We know where their offices are.
[01:24:24.905 --> 01:24:29.228]  For instance, at the City of Knowledge down in Panama, there's more than 62 NGOs down there.
[01:24:29.508 --> 01:24:30.889]  Norwegian Refugee Council.
[01:24:31.289 --> 01:24:31.789]  Highest.
[01:24:32.670 --> 01:24:33.931]  Doctors without morals.
[01:24:34.692 --> 01:24:43.258]  You know, of course, IOM, UNHCR, World Food Program, Office of American... And just like with the UN, you can't swing a stick in the dark and not hit a pedophile.
[01:24:43.698 --> 01:24:43.918]  No.
[01:24:44.019 --> 01:24:44.799]  They're just down there.
[01:24:44.939 --> 01:24:45.920]  You should see it down there.
[01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:47.962]  Or not just down there, but in Texas as well.
[01:24:48.102 --> 01:24:50.543]  I mean, it's straight up... It's gross.
[01:24:50.603 --> 01:24:54.626]  I mean, you have... They have males, you know... Picking up little kids.
[01:24:54.907 --> 01:24:55.227]  Oh, yeah.
[01:24:55.387 --> 01:24:57.669]  We got it on tape just a few times when we went down there.
[01:24:58.109 --> 01:24:58.329]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:24:58.589 --> 01:24:59.449]  And then the guy's still there.
[01:24:59.469 --> 01:25:02.010]  He goes, I'm here to show these children the way of the Lord.
[01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.910]  Get out of my way.
[01:25:04.511 --> 01:25:06.492]  And you want to beat their ass, you go to jail.
[01:25:06.892 --> 01:25:07.992]  But then you feel guilty.
[01:25:08.032 --> 01:25:09.152]  I know the board of professionals feels that.
[01:25:09.172 --> 01:25:11.873]  I'm like, I told the crew, I said, I feel like I'm part of this now.
[01:25:11.893 --> 01:25:13.974]  They're like, yeah, we want to kill this guy.
[01:25:14.642 --> 01:25:16.463]  I mean, it's sick.
[01:25:16.523 --> 01:25:18.103]  Yeah, yeah, I know the feeling.
[01:25:18.263 --> 01:25:19.624]  I feel the same feeling.
[01:25:19.684 --> 01:25:21.224]  Like, we know who they are.
[01:25:21.304 --> 01:25:22.165]  We know where they work.
[01:25:22.385 --> 01:25:24.265]  You know, I mean, we know who they are.
[01:25:24.366 --> 01:25:26.806]  And the bottom line is, it continues to happen.
[01:25:27.087 --> 01:25:29.187]  We had an undercover cop inside that was working with us.
[01:25:29.627 --> 01:25:31.548]  She comes out, because he chased her out.
[01:25:31.568 --> 01:25:32.548]  She was asking questions.
[01:25:32.568 --> 01:25:34.809]  And he's like, I don't want adults.
[01:25:34.909 --> 01:25:35.890]  I want children.
[01:25:36.350 --> 01:25:37.330]  Load them in my van.
[01:25:37.370 --> 01:25:38.351]  You promised me kids.
[01:25:38.371 --> 01:25:39.631]  They go, sir, we'll get them to you.
[01:25:39.651 --> 01:25:40.551]  We'll get them to you.
[01:25:40.571 --> 01:25:41.812]  And she starts asking questions.
[01:25:42.412 --> 01:25:48.319]  And he knows the Spanish, he's a big white guy, and comes out and says, he runs into us.
[01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:52.924]  He's like, I'm going to show these children the way of the Lord.
[01:25:53.485 --> 01:25:54.486]  What's wrong with me?
[01:25:54.526 --> 01:25:55.688]  I mean, it was like, whoa.
[01:25:55.708 --> 01:25:57.670]  It was like, whoa.
[01:25:57.970 --> 01:25:59.652]  And later they loaded kids up and he went off and...
[01:26:00.578 --> 01:26:01.458]  Disappeared in a black hole.
[01:26:01.718 --> 01:26:02.218]  I saw that.
[01:26:02.519 --> 01:26:03.799]  I mean, there's no telling what happened.
[01:26:03.839 --> 01:26:04.499]  You can't make this up.
[01:26:04.519 --> 01:26:05.579]  I mean, that's just one of the cases.
[01:26:05.719 --> 01:26:05.879]  Yeah.
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:10.341]  Now, keep in mind, the Chinese ecosystem is completely different than the rest of them.
[01:26:10.681 --> 01:26:14.082]  The Chinese clearly are on a path to world domination.
[01:26:14.402 --> 01:26:17.543]  And this is actually a group that can achieve a lot of their goals.
[01:26:17.603 --> 01:26:18.223]  They're squaring away.
[01:26:18.843 --> 01:26:19.624]  They are squared away.
[01:26:19.664 --> 01:26:20.184]  They're smart.
[01:26:20.684 --> 01:26:27.410]  Again, I've spent a lot of time with Chinese in and around China, Tibet, all over Beijing, Shanghai, Long, the Xi'an.
[01:26:27.690 --> 01:26:30.812]  The bottom line is they come in with a plan.
[01:26:31.052 --> 01:26:35.656]  They're taking over marijuana grows up in Maine and Oregon and Oklahoma and that sort of thing.
[01:26:35.676 --> 01:26:36.617]  What do they put in that marijuana?
[01:26:36.937 --> 01:26:40.620]  But the bottom line is they're now selling marijuana to our people.
[01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:43.142]  They're making money on our invasion.
[01:26:43.162 --> 01:26:44.523]  They reversed the opium wars.
[01:26:45.063 --> 01:26:45.343]  Oh, yeah.
[01:26:45.383 --> 01:26:49.005]  Now, it's often, you know, when I bring this up to Chinese, they're like, what about the opium wars?
[01:26:49.065 --> 01:26:50.486]  And I'm like, look, that was the British.
[01:26:50.846 --> 01:26:51.826]  I'm not British, right?
[01:26:52.066 --> 01:26:56.449]  Yeah, like, if my great-great-grandfather did something wrong to you, what the hell does that mean I'm guilty?
[01:26:56.489 --> 01:26:57.749]  Yeah, and I'm not British anyway.
[01:26:57.809 --> 01:26:58.790]  We shot the British, too.
[01:26:59.070 --> 01:27:01.771]  I had two of my grandfathers fight in the Revolutionary War.
[01:27:01.871 --> 01:27:03.312]  One was a colonel in North Carolina.
[01:27:03.592 --> 01:27:05.333]  You know, he might have been... Great-great-great-great-grandfather.
[01:27:05.453 --> 01:27:07.554]  Oh, yeah, like super-alter great-grandfather.
[01:27:07.614 --> 01:27:17.340]  He may have fought the Green Jackets, who I ended up with in Iraq and Afghanistan, and I said to one of the British soldiers one time, I hope my granddaddy shot your granddaddy in the chest with a ball, you know?
[01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:18.921]  But anyway, I love you today.
[01:27:20.802 --> 01:27:23.424]  We're over all that now, but the bottom line is...
[01:27:24.204 --> 01:27:24.924]  We're not British.
[01:27:25.124 --> 01:27:29.926]  And the British obviously did the opium wars and whatnot, but the Chinese used that as cause of spelling.
[01:27:29.966 --> 01:27:37.649]  Now, keep in mind, one of the things that the Chinese do as well is they are, for instance, in Honduras, we were just down there looking at their archaeological warfare.
[01:27:37.809 --> 01:27:41.430]  I always go to libraries, museums, archaeological digs.
[01:27:41.690 --> 01:27:50.313]  They're trying to persuade the Mayan Indians that they're actually long-lost cousins of the Chinese and that they came over the land bridge and all these bad white people came and took your land.
[01:27:50.353 --> 01:27:50.994]  So they're giving them...
[01:27:51.974 --> 01:27:52.134]  I think.
[01:28:14.764 --> 01:28:21.992]  You know, trying to persuade all the indigenous people that they can that you're long-lost cousins of Chinese, and we're coming to help take this stuff back.
[01:28:22.012 --> 01:28:26.718]  Well, I mean, it's true that they got Mongolian spots when they're born and all that, because they are of Asian derivation.
[01:28:26.738 --> 01:28:29.361]  It doesn't mean they're Chinese or the Communist Party.
[01:28:29.781 --> 01:28:30.582]  That's preposterous.
[01:28:30.862 --> 01:28:31.263]  That's right.
[01:28:31.343 --> 01:28:33.005]  Some of the Mayans have those spots as well.
[01:28:33.225 --> 01:28:35.408]  But I don't think most people don't know what you're talking about, though.
[01:28:36.469 --> 01:28:37.190]  They are Asian.
[01:28:37.711 --> 01:28:38.412]  They're really Huns.
[01:28:39.032 --> 01:28:45.621]  All right, we're going to come right back, my friend, and we're going to have Doc Chambers in the control room to talk about the big victory.
[01:28:45.661 --> 01:28:46.502]  Get that B-roll ready.
[01:28:46.543 --> 01:28:48.125]  The 14 governors at the event.
[01:28:48.685 --> 01:28:50.328]  We stopped the left doing a false flag.
[01:28:50.348 --> 01:28:51.009]  Big victory.
[01:28:51.329 --> 01:28:51.830]  Stay with us.
[01:28:52.170 --> 01:28:53.211]  Infowars.com.
[01:28:59.198 --> 01:29:01.759]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalist.
[01:29:02.119 --> 01:29:04.481]  And people can't identify who's a patriot and who isn't.
[01:29:04.801 --> 01:29:07.942]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalist.
[01:29:08.002 --> 01:29:10.924]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.
[01:29:11.164 --> 01:29:21.749]  That's why I designed this amazing 1776 red, white, and blue Gadsden flag shirt so you can support the Infowar and meet like-minded people everywhere when you wear it.
[01:29:21.869 --> 01:29:22.369]  We're good to go.
[01:29:39.378 --> 01:29:43.480]  This is antithetical, the complete opposite of what the globalists are pushing.
[01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:51.523]  So get both the Team Humanity and the 1776 Gadsden Snake Shirts Limited Edition at Infowarsstore.com right now.
[01:29:51.923 --> 01:29:55.704]  Spread the word, meet like-minded people, and fund the 1776 revolution worldwide.
[01:29:59.013 --> 01:30:02.534]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[01:30:02.914 --> 01:30:09.937]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[01:30:10.117 --> 01:30:12.117]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[01:30:12.297 --> 01:30:13.358]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[01:30:13.378 --> 01:30:14.078]  He loved the idea.
[01:30:14.418 --> 01:30:17.939]  What would you call the debate and discussion about a pro-human future?
[01:30:17.959 --> 01:30:18.839]  Just Team Humanity?
[01:30:18.919 --> 01:30:19.800]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:20.320]  Absolutely.
[01:30:38.285 --> 01:30:45.268]  This is a revolution against the globalists and it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[01:30:45.548 --> 01:30:46.868]  We're told humans are the problem.
[01:30:46.888 --> 01:30:47.889]  We're told we're killing the earth.
[01:30:48.169 --> 01:30:52.430]  We're told all this garbage so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[01:30:52.731 --> 01:30:53.431]  We're not going to do that.
[01:30:53.691 --> 01:30:58.333]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:04.982]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[01:31:05.722 --> 01:31:10.003]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[01:31:10.403 --> 01:31:14.785]  We finally have a limited run back in supply at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:16.225 --> 01:31:19.008]  So many people have serious issues.
[01:31:19.268 --> 01:31:20.409]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[01:31:20.829 --> 01:31:26.254]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[01:31:26.795 --> 01:31:32.199]  Most of the other iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:35.723]  But this is pure atomic certified iodine.
[01:31:38.407 --> 01:31:41.489]  X2 is now back in stock, discounted.
[01:31:41.829 --> 01:31:45.012]  So I'm giving Thanksgiving right now for this product being here.
[01:31:45.352 --> 01:31:50.436]  It funds the InfoWar, but I guarantee you, you take this for a few weeks, you will feel the difference.
[01:31:50.616 --> 01:31:51.396]  It is amazing.
[01:31:51.737 --> 01:31:55.760]  It's the missing link, X2, back in stock at the end of 2023 at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:31:55.780 --> 01:31:55.800]  X2.
[01:31:59.082 --> 01:32:04.385]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing, high-quality coffee has not been available.
[01:32:04.825 --> 01:32:09.228]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[01:32:09.668 --> 01:32:12.129]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[01:32:12.689 --> 01:32:22.074]  But now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.
[01:32:22.274 --> 01:32:24.856]  It's powered by the company, Minuteman Coffee.

[01:33:00.419 --> 01:33:06.363]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:11.306 --> 01:33:13.647]  The program leftists failed to silence.
[01:33:14.208 --> 01:33:15.789]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:38.078 --> 01:33:48.861]  Now, I'm not here telling Mike Leon what to do, but he has succeeded in his two-year mission to get Darian Gapp in front of Congress on Fox News, Tucker Carlson, the U.N.
[01:33:48.941 --> 01:33:49.341]  funding.
[01:33:49.482 --> 01:33:51.402]  I tried to get Congress to focus on U.N.
[01:33:51.442 --> 01:33:51.802]  funding.
[01:33:52.222 --> 01:33:53.043]  It's the Achilles heel.
[01:33:53.323 --> 01:33:54.163]  This guy did it.
[01:33:54.743 --> 01:34:01.505]  And it's not about, he doesn't want the credit, but it's about the credit of motivated people and what they've done, and we can win.
[01:34:01.545 --> 01:34:02.525]  Let's get that straight.
[01:34:02.726 --> 01:34:03.846]  Look how far we've all come.
[01:34:04.892 --> 01:34:09.177]  Now, Jack Posobiec, formerly Naval Intelligence, nobody I know is as dialed in as he is.
[01:34:09.197 --> 01:34:10.198]  Let's just leave it at that.
[01:34:10.898 --> 01:34:15.623]  He said over a year ago they're going to try to make Poland, they're going to put in this new leader they did.
[01:34:15.643 --> 01:34:19.587]  He named him a year ago, and they're going to start arresting the opposition in Poland.
[01:34:20.188 --> 01:34:20.548]  We're good to go.
[01:34:45.206 --> 01:34:47.951]  So for tomorrow's news today, popping in for just a few minutes is Jack Posobiec.
[01:34:47.971 --> 01:34:48.692]  Jack, thanks for joining us.
[01:35:01.309 --> 01:35:02.589]  Alex, thanks so much for having me on.
[01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:03.390]  Michael, how are you?
[01:35:03.410 --> 01:35:06.031]  Good to see you safe back in the United States.
[01:35:06.051 --> 01:35:07.611]  They're always trying to take you out, man.
[01:35:07.831 --> 01:35:09.632]  I've been wanting to get you down, man.
[01:35:09.792 --> 01:35:11.232]  You're a number one target.
[01:35:11.373 --> 01:35:13.093]  Come with me to Darien, please.
[01:35:13.493 --> 01:35:14.173]  I keep inviting you.
[01:35:14.193 --> 01:35:15.114]  All right, all right, all right.
[01:35:15.234 --> 01:35:16.814]  It's time for you to come.
[01:35:16.914 --> 01:35:20.096]  No, we won't break any obstacle, but we might have to put something together.
[01:35:20.116 --> 01:35:21.176]  We might have to put something together.
[01:35:21.196 --> 01:35:23.197]  All right, give us the report.
[01:35:23.237 --> 01:35:23.937]  This is serious.
[01:35:25.031 --> 01:35:26.651]  All right, Alex, so here's what's going on.
[01:35:27.151 --> 01:35:39.074]  It's very clear to me now, and the pieces of this have been coming to place for a past year now because what's happening in Poland is intrinsically linked to what's happening in Ukraine.
[01:35:39.214 --> 01:35:45.715]  And what we're seeing the globalists pursue is a Syrianization strategy with Ukraine.
[01:35:46.095 --> 01:35:47.096]  What do I mean by this?
[01:35:47.156 --> 01:35:47.896]  It's very simple.
[01:35:47.936 --> 01:35:53.057]  Remember, Russia was last involved in a conflict where the United States was a party
[01:35:53.772 --> 01:35:56.196]  Not in Ukraine, but prior to that was the what?
[01:35:56.296 --> 01:35:57.798]  The Syrian Civil War.
[01:35:58.299 --> 01:36:00.642]  Go and look at where the Syrian Civil War is now.
[01:36:00.702 --> 01:36:06.370]  And oh, by the way, this is exactly where all of these attacks are taking place on those bases where we've got U.S.
[01:36:06.430 --> 01:36:10.055]  soldiers, where people were killed just across the border in Jordan, Tower 22.
[01:36:11.331 --> 01:36:12.391]  What do we have there?
[01:36:12.411 --> 01:36:13.052]  We've got U.S.
[01:36:13.092 --> 01:36:25.696]  forces on the ground, particularly in the border region, particularly in the Kurdish regions in the northeast, providing basically this human shield against possible incursions from the Iranians, from Shia militia groups from Turkey to the north.
[01:36:26.056 --> 01:36:31.038]  And then you've, of course, got Russia propping up and really strongly with the Syrian army and Assad.
[01:36:31.558 --> 01:36:35.079]  Now you're going to see a similar situation, all right?
[01:36:35.099 --> 01:36:36.760]  You're going to see a similar situation.
[01:36:37.140 --> 01:36:39.540]  This is where they plan to move things with Ukraine.
[01:36:39.921 --> 01:36:40.901]  Because what are they going to do?
[01:36:41.658 --> 01:36:43.300]  They're going to say, okay, it's a frozen conflict.
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:45.763]  They're going to draw the line essentially at the river there.
[01:36:46.144 --> 01:36:51.271]  Putin's already talking about putting in a DMZ and people are arguing about where that DMZ is going to be.
[01:36:51.311 --> 01:36:53.133]  Is it going to include Odessa, etc., etc.?
[01:36:53.494 --> 01:36:57.419]  But then, of course, you need that force to provide the stabilization arm.
[01:36:57.799 --> 01:36:58.280]  We're good to go.
[01:36:58.300 --> 01:36:58.520]  I think?
[01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:22.283]  Because who is Zelensky talking about putting in charge of the military?
[01:37:22.543 --> 01:37:30.989]  He's talking about not just getting rid of the head of the military, he wants to replace the entire heads of every department of the military and put this guy Budanov in there.
[01:37:31.330 --> 01:37:33.091]  Budanov, what's his background?
[01:37:33.371 --> 01:37:36.814]  He's from the intelligence services of Ukraine.
[01:37:37.054 --> 01:37:40.277]  He's the CIA's top partner in Ukraine.
[01:37:40.317 --> 01:37:42.859]  This is the guy who was behind the Kerch Bridge attack.
[01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:48.204]  He's been behind a series of covert clandestine operations against Russia, against the backfield.
[01:37:48.405 --> 01:37:50.486]  Alex, this is exactly what they're planning for.
[01:37:50.867 --> 01:37:59.615]  That $60 billion that you see in that bill that's currently on the table in Congress, it's been stalled right now, but the reason they want that $60 billion in
[01:37:59.855 --> 01:38:07.740]  And that's number one, to prop up the Zelensky regime, and then number two, they're going to conduct a series, they're going to move this to a counterinsurgency phase using what?
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:12.182]  The same style as Operation Gladio-style leave-behind networks.
[01:38:12.222 --> 01:38:13.263]  That's what they're putting Putin on.
[01:38:13.283 --> 01:38:16.725]  That's why you'd put an intel agent in charge of the entire military.
[01:38:17.045 --> 01:38:20.287]  This guy is straight out of the Operation Gladio schoolbook.
[01:38:20.708 --> 01:38:26.291]  This is the guy who comes out of that system, the CIA's going to put him there, and then they're going to use him for terror attacks,
[01:38:26.736 --> 01:38:29.578]  And the final ingredient, if I can interrupt, will be...
[01:38:56.656 --> 01:39:00.478]  Provocateur events claiming Russian missiles, Russian events.
[01:39:00.678 --> 01:39:01.939]  Of course!
[01:39:02.279 --> 01:39:02.799]  All of it.
[01:39:03.039 --> 01:39:03.439]  All of it.
[01:39:03.860 --> 01:39:05.300]  And this was Operation Gladio.
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:13.064]  Operation Gladio originally was they were going to blame these attacks on communists and say communists are attacking Italy, communists are attacking Germany.
[01:39:13.304 --> 01:39:15.125]  We need to go war against the Soviet Union.
[01:39:15.245 --> 01:39:16.906]  That was the point of Operation Gladio.
[01:39:16.926 --> 01:39:18.587]  Thank God it wasn't successful.
[01:39:18.647 --> 01:39:22.649]  They're trying Operation Gladio 2.0 right before our eyes in Ukraine.
[01:39:23.129 --> 01:39:24.310]  You were on the show a year ago.
[01:39:25.885 --> 01:39:26.266]  I think.
[01:39:46.249 --> 01:39:46.610]  Yes, read in...
[01:39:58.194 --> 01:40:04.138]  Now, Sweden, of course, Sweden is one of the most anti-Russia countries in all of Europe, I would say, besides Poland.
[01:40:04.438 --> 01:40:08.441]  Poland, of course, in recent history has many reasons to be anti-Russia.
[01:40:08.721 --> 01:40:16.866]  Sweden, of course, though, is extremely anti-Russia because, remember, before Russia, before Russia controlled sort of the northern tier of Europe, who was it?
[01:40:16.906 --> 01:40:18.387]  It was the Swedish Empire.
[01:40:18.687 --> 01:40:20.829]  And it was those wars against Peter the Great.
[01:40:21.189 --> 01:40:22.809]  And people ask, why does something hundreds of years ago matter?
[01:40:22.849 --> 01:40:23.570]  It's like Crips and Blood.
[01:40:23.590 --> 01:40:26.210]  Somebody's great-granddaddy killed their granddaddy.
[01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:30.011]  And so NATO and the sociologists and the anthropologists are manipulating these old fault lines.
[01:40:48.942 --> 01:40:56.071]  Of course, they're going through and saying, oh, that's the Russians, you remember them from... We're talking, by the way, this is hundreds of years ago, the Swedish Empire.
[01:40:56.651 --> 01:41:02.659]  When you're talking Poland, it's okay, you do at least have people within living memory who remember what the Russian communists were doing.
[01:41:02.679 --> 01:41:04.120]  This was for 80 years after World War II, but...
[01:41:06.343 --> 01:41:18.267]  The issue here, Alex, is they're using these moral fault lines, these historic fault lines, these historic animuses to gin up support for a wider war and a wider conflict.
[01:41:18.287 --> 01:41:21.068]  So they'll say, okay, maybe we need some Swedish troops, right?
[01:41:21.128 --> 01:41:23.109]  Sweden, what is the point of having Sweden there?
[01:41:23.149 --> 01:41:27.391]  Because if you have Sweden there, then you have Denmark, then you have Finland.
[01:41:27.651 --> 01:41:28.371]  What does this do?
[01:41:28.751 --> 01:41:33.333]  This provides the ability to counteract Russia in the Baltic states.
[01:41:33.513 --> 01:41:37.841]  And you predicted all of this, so... Absolutely.
[01:41:37.861 --> 01:41:42.229]  I'm going to stop interrupting, but you already predicted this months ago, six months ago, a year ago.
[01:41:42.610 --> 01:41:43.632]  Tell us what's coming next.
[01:41:43.672 --> 01:41:44.673]  That's what Jack Posobiec does.
[01:41:46.129 --> 01:41:53.374]  What's coming next, I'll tell you, it's going to be, on one hand, they will claim that is the stabilization of Ukraine.
[01:41:53.394 --> 01:41:55.596]  They're going to say we're going to stabilize the conflict.
[01:41:55.856 --> 01:41:57.537]  Look, Biden knows this thing's a loser.
[01:41:57.577 --> 01:42:01.740]  He doesn't want this thing going on all the way to 2024 while he's got an election coming up.
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:03.701]  He's going to claim to want stabilization.
[01:42:03.941 --> 01:42:07.744]  What we're going to see are more of these provocations.
[01:42:07.764 --> 01:42:08.284]  Thank you.
[01:42:10.646 --> 01:42:12.707]  Provocations going on in the backfield.
[01:42:12.727 --> 01:42:16.388]  You're going to see attacks potentially on Polish troops, Polish civilians.
[01:42:16.408 --> 01:42:19.729]  You're going to see attacks on Russian civilians, Russian civilian infrastructure.
[01:42:19.749 --> 01:42:24.931]  Remember, they murdered a truck driver in cold blood to take out the Kurt Strait Bridge.
[01:42:24.971 --> 01:42:26.971]  That's exactly who these guys are.
[01:42:27.011 --> 01:42:28.532]  They're willing to take out civilians.
[01:42:28.772 --> 01:42:32.693]  They're willing to kill people who are just truck drivers or service workers.
[01:42:32.753 --> 01:42:35.214]  They're willing to cut Europe's gas off!
[01:42:35.734 --> 01:42:37.215]  They'll kill everyone.
[01:42:37.556 --> 01:42:39.517]  They don't care because you've got these people.
[01:42:39.858 --> 01:42:42.220]  And Alex, you and I have said it so many times.
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:47.084]  Victoria Nuland, you have to understand her Trotskyite background to understand.
[01:42:47.344 --> 01:42:51.227]  Yes, she is a communist, but her family was kicked out of Russia.
[01:42:51.488 --> 01:42:52.869]  They lived right near Odessa.
[01:42:53.746 --> 01:42:54.507]  We're good to go.
[01:43:15.515 --> 01:43:16.716]  Oh my God.
[01:43:16.736 --> 01:43:20.039]  This is all the same wars being fought over again.
[01:43:20.700 --> 01:43:26.105]  Jack, I know you've got your own show coming up here in about 15-20 minutes there on Human Events.
[01:43:26.185 --> 01:43:28.047]  In two minutes, what else do you want to tell us?
[01:43:29.295 --> 01:43:38.226]  Well, look, the main thing, of course, we're starting to get reports, obviously, about Tucker, the fact that he's over there speaking, potentially speaking with Putin.
[01:43:38.286 --> 01:43:40.028]  We've seen some of these vans going in.
[01:43:40.088 --> 01:43:41.470]  People say that he's had the interview.
[01:43:41.530 --> 01:43:45.014]  There's some rumors floating around about excerpts of the interview.
[01:43:45.134 --> 01:43:45.815]  All I know is...
[01:43:46.215 --> 01:43:55.261]  Everyone I know who's close to Tucker is saying that he's being very tight-lipped about it, even within his inner circle, whether or not he's had the interview at all.
[01:43:55.301 --> 01:44:01.266]  And that's probably because he knows that his phone is being spied on by everyone right now.
[01:44:01.846 --> 01:44:04.168]  Let me just say, I can confirm that.
[01:44:04.688 --> 01:44:05.469]  I can confirm that.
[01:44:06.029 --> 01:44:09.832]  He told me, you can't really talk on the phone, but I'm going to Europe.
[01:44:09.992 --> 01:44:10.852]  Wait till you see this.
[01:44:11.233 --> 01:44:12.093]  And I was like, oh, Europe.
[01:44:12.113 --> 01:44:13.054]  He's like, yeah, Europe.
[01:44:14.773 --> 01:44:16.775]  Yeah, so yeah, the Europe of Europe.
[01:44:16.795 --> 01:44:23.141]  So I think that the interview that comes out with Tucker and Putin is going to be absolutely monumental.
[01:44:23.201 --> 01:44:25.724]  And by the way, people have said, well, oh, why is he interviewing Putin?
[01:44:25.744 --> 01:44:26.985]  I said, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:44:27.305 --> 01:44:28.807]  He should interview Zelensky, too.
[01:44:29.127 --> 01:44:30.148]  He's in the neighborhood.
[01:44:30.408 --> 01:44:35.233]  Why not pop on down to Kiev and say, hey, Vladimir Zelensky, I interviewed the other Vlad.
[01:44:35.273 --> 01:44:36.514]  Let's interview you next.
[01:44:36.654 --> 01:44:37.395]  Let's have fun.
[01:44:37.735 --> 01:44:41.837]  By the way, Jack, is that your source?
[01:44:41.858 --> 01:44:43.158]  Because I was actually told that.
[01:44:43.278 --> 01:44:44.519]  Tucker's there for two more weeks.
[01:44:44.919 --> 01:44:46.660]  That's what I was told, not by Tucker, but others.
[01:44:47.941 --> 01:44:50.102]  He wants the Zelensky interview, too, and some other big ones.
[01:44:50.402 --> 01:44:53.064]  What do you predict the other interviews are going to be?
[01:44:55.209 --> 01:44:56.389]  I think Zelensky's going to shut that down.
[01:44:56.469 --> 01:44:57.590]  I just don't think it's going to happen.
[01:44:57.610 --> 01:44:58.590]  I don't think it's in the cards.
[01:44:58.670 --> 01:45:20.474]  I don't think anyone on that side is going to allow Zelensky to sit down with someone who's actually going to ask him hard questions about where the money's going, hard questions about why so many members of his inner circle are being arrested right now for corruption, and, oh, by the way, the fact that Zelensky is rapidly reaching his expiration date because the guy that he's trying to take out of the military right now, by the way,
[01:45:21.034 --> 01:45:24.958]  Well, you said that a month ago, and it's just like Hitler was jealous of Erwin Rommel.
[01:45:24.998 --> 01:45:27.100]  He's very jealous of this general.
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:30.523]  I think we'll probably end up seeing that general be the leader.
[01:45:42.233 --> 01:45:48.055]  Yeah, Ukraine is at a precipice and absolutely ripe for a military takeover right now.
[01:45:48.636 --> 01:45:53.438]  You would see the military essentially push Zelensky out and then maybe prop up somebody else.
[01:45:53.798 --> 01:45:59.700]  Take Petro Poroshenko, for example, the guy who was the previous president and, again, who was selected by Vicky Nuland to be president.
[01:45:59.980 --> 01:46:02.701]  He was the one that was propped up, an oligarch in his own right.
[01:46:02.741 --> 01:46:08.984]  They call him the chocolate oligarch, the chocolate man, because he runs this confectionery industry all throughout Ukraine.
[01:46:09.024 --> 01:46:10.865]  And isn't Vicky Nuland really the president?
[01:46:11.725 --> 01:46:13.325]  She's the one calling the shots.
[01:46:13.766 --> 01:46:15.126]  She's always the one calling the shots.
[01:46:15.186 --> 01:46:16.506]  He's not the one who's there.
[01:46:16.586 --> 01:46:29.330]  One of these excerpts from the rumored excerpts from the Putin interview with Tucker is that Tucker asks him about Zelensky and Putin supposedly.
[01:46:29.670 --> 01:46:32.030]  Again, caveat, caveat, I have no idea if this is real.
[01:46:32.310 --> 01:46:34.691]  It's probably not, but the response is something along the lines of,
[01:46:35.511 --> 01:46:41.235]  Well, you know, Zelinsky, I used to watch him on the Russian comedy shows that he used to do, and he used to make me laugh a lot.
[01:46:41.295 --> 01:46:42.596]  Maybe we can go back to that.
[01:46:42.956 --> 01:46:49.840]  So, of course, Zelinsky was very popular in Russia prior to this for these variety shows, and he was a comedian.
[01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:53.402]  I think the essential thinking is that this guy is a puppet.
[01:46:53.462 --> 01:46:56.104]  He's going to go back to playing the piano with his penis.
[01:46:56.504 --> 01:46:58.065]  All right, how do people find Jack Posobiec?
[01:46:59.164 --> 01:47:01.266]  We'll be up at human events daily.
[01:47:01.306 --> 01:47:02.126]  It's going to be coming up.
[01:47:02.166 --> 01:47:04.908]  Of course, we're live on X. We're going to be on Rumble.
[01:47:04.948 --> 01:47:05.949]  We're going to be everywhere.
[01:47:06.009 --> 01:47:12.133]  And if you're listening to InfoWars, you can check us out afterwards on the podcast because I know Alex is up at the same time.
[01:47:12.554 --> 01:47:12.834]  All right.
[01:47:12.874 --> 01:47:13.834]  Thank you so much, Jack.
[01:47:13.874 --> 01:47:14.855]  Please join us again soon.
[01:47:14.935 --> 01:47:15.316]  Dead on.
[01:47:15.336 --> 01:47:15.956]  All right.
[01:47:15.976 --> 01:47:16.757]  God bless, Alex.
[01:47:16.817 --> 01:47:17.557]  Be safe, Michael.
[01:47:17.577 --> 01:47:18.358]  All right.
[01:47:18.758 --> 01:47:19.198]  See you, Jack.
[01:47:19.218 --> 01:47:19.659]  All right.
[01:47:19.679 --> 01:47:21.040]  We're extending your interview 15 minutes.
[01:47:21.060 --> 01:47:22.020]  You guys get your time back.
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:22.941]  Thanks for listening to Jack.
[01:47:22.981 --> 01:47:24.082]  He's got you guys dead on.
[01:47:25.892 --> 01:47:31.596]  I want your comment on that, and I want to get retired Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Pete Chambers' brief take geopolitically.
[01:47:31.616 --> 01:47:32.276]  We're going to shift gears.
[01:47:32.316 --> 01:47:40.181]  The big victory was the trucker convoy, 14 governors, the provocateurs you guys stopped, and then just your overall view of what's happening in America right now.
[01:47:40.401 --> 01:47:42.082]  But you want to make some comments on what the subject just said?
[01:47:42.102 --> 01:47:43.483]  You were stationed over in Europe.
[01:47:43.803 --> 01:47:44.143]  Oh, yeah.
[01:47:44.163 --> 01:47:47.765]  You know, I lived in Poland for two years after I was in Special Forces.
[01:47:47.805 --> 01:47:54.648]  When I was in Special Forces, my two different A-teams trained to parachute into Poland near a town called Białystok.
[01:47:54.668 --> 01:47:56.069]  We trained for three years to do that.
[01:47:57.009 --> 01:47:57.989]  A great deal of training.
[01:47:58.610 --> 01:48:02.271]  And what you said earlier, Alex, is like this is a never-ending war.
[01:48:02.631 --> 01:48:05.433]  It's like a flower that keeps blooming, except it's a dark flower.
[01:48:05.773 --> 01:48:07.334]  I mean, it's Jurassic Trailer Park.
[01:48:07.374 --> 01:48:08.034]  It's like herpes.
[01:48:08.835 --> 01:48:10.156]  It just goes on and on and on.
[01:48:10.216 --> 01:48:11.178]  I love the Polish people.
[01:48:11.198 --> 01:48:14.021]  Like I said, I lived there for two years after the army.
[01:48:14.862 --> 01:48:18.327]  But at the same time, it will end up just being a forever war.
[01:48:19.047 --> 01:48:25.435]  You can just see it unfolding, whether it's the Baltics, Lithuania, of course, then Latvia and Estonia.
[01:48:26.296 --> 01:48:26.776]  We're good to go.
[01:48:43.602 --> 01:48:44.703]  Europe needs the energy.
[01:48:44.983 --> 01:48:54.412]  You know, I was at BASF, what, a year and a half ago or so, and I was warning, or I was actually asking, what's going to happen to the Nord Stream pipeline?
[01:48:54.432 --> 01:48:55.693]  I actually had an iPad.
[01:48:55.773 --> 01:48:56.153]  No, I know.
[01:48:56.173 --> 01:48:56.954]  You ought to find that clip.
[01:48:56.974 --> 01:48:57.715]  Here's what you're saying.
[01:48:57.955 --> 01:48:58.816]  The war's never end.
[01:48:58.836 --> 01:48:59.717]  They're just put on pause.
[01:49:00.561 --> 01:49:01.162]  Absolutely.
[01:49:01.502 --> 01:49:05.225]  And then, for instance, the Nord Stream, that it would be cut, was really obvious.
[01:49:05.565 --> 01:49:12.870]  I bought an iPad that I kept beside me just watching Nord Stream flows because there was a website that monitored the flows.
[01:49:13.291 --> 01:49:15.332]  And one day it went to zero, and I was like, uh-oh.
[01:49:15.492 --> 01:49:18.154]  By the way, that's who we have on as guests, as people that are right over there.
[01:49:18.374 --> 01:49:19.195]  You never toot your horn.
[01:49:19.475 --> 01:49:21.677]  You should repost on X all the things you predicted.
[01:49:22.858 --> 01:49:23.699]  You're probably right.
[01:49:24.039 --> 01:49:25.680]  No, because then that brings everybody back to what you're doing.
[01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:27.101]  It's not about what you're doing.
[01:49:27.141 --> 01:49:35.528]  Let's bring in Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Pete Chambers, Green Beret commander, great patriot, expert on the border, but down there in a lot of clandestine stuff.
[01:49:36.129 --> 01:49:40.032]  He led the great convoys or part of the Texas convoy down there, helped run security.
[01:49:40.052 --> 01:49:41.112]  It turned out it was a big victory.
[01:49:41.152 --> 01:49:43.114]  Fourteen governors showed up.
[01:49:43.254 --> 01:49:46.557]  I cannot say enough about how you guys navigated this.
[01:49:47.117 --> 01:49:50.340]  Give us your 35,000-foot view on what we've generally been talking about, sir.
[01:49:50.961 --> 01:49:55.308]  You're here in studio with us in the control room, and then let's drill into what happened at the border in the last week.
[01:49:56.272 --> 01:49:56.892]  Right, Alex.
[01:49:56.992 --> 01:49:57.993]  Yeah, it's good to be here again.
[01:49:58.033 --> 01:50:21.759]  So what we had was a provocateur attack, fifth-generation warfare style, with provocateur media, not only them, but infiltrators into the convoys, and then what I call like a World War I, which was an attack where a bulge in the lines of the superior force enemy is surrounded on all three sides by an inferior force in numbers.
[01:50:22.139 --> 01:50:23.760]  So you had Texas law enforcement,
[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:27.162]  Supported by the governor of Texas.
[01:50:27.483 --> 01:50:31.106]  You had we the people down there doing their thing, safely, peacefully assembling.
[01:50:31.506 --> 01:50:32.767]  The take our border back people.
[01:50:33.228 --> 01:50:36.370]  And then you had, where are the men from Texas, Tucker Carlson?
[01:50:36.671 --> 01:50:37.852]  We were out there in the darkness.
[01:50:37.892 --> 01:50:40.814]  And we were out there protecting this thing from those provocateurs.
[01:50:41.134 --> 01:50:50.663]  And that is a three-sided prong attack which combines all those elements of we the people and the local government to thwart off this fifth generation provocateur attack.
[01:50:51.623 --> 01:50:56.267]  Tell us about some of the stuff that happened, because I saw some of these provocateurs saying, Alex Jones is down here.
[01:50:56.327 --> 01:50:59.330]  They just beat up migrants.
[01:50:59.950 --> 01:51:00.531]  I've got the clip.
[01:51:00.551 --> 01:51:01.712]  I don't want to give the guy attention here.
[01:51:02.052 --> 01:51:06.396]  But, I mean, they were just freaking out and just putting out total disinformation.
[01:51:06.656 --> 01:51:15.880]  Well, before the convoy got there, real quick, the hailstorm hit while the provocateur protesters against Christians were down there, and they had to vacate the scene.
[01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:16.680]  That's perfect.
[01:51:16.921 --> 01:51:20.282]  Then the convoy came in safely, set up, had a wonderful time.
[01:51:20.582 --> 01:51:35.909]  But in the unseen places where we'll celebrate this with cigar and scotch about two weeks from now, things happened to prevent that, which are us giving names to the local law enforcement and to state law enforcement, the DPS, Department of Public Safety,
[01:51:36.429 --> 01:51:44.231]  That they could then use that information to make sure that those people were warned, do not try to mess with these people, because they had different agendas.
[01:51:45.372 --> 01:51:56.435]  Well, I mean, I know, tell us as much as you can about it, but then also with a great success, 14 governors, massive attention, right at the time of trying to put this bill through that gives Biden dictatorial power?
[01:51:56.635 --> 01:52:02.157]  Well, those 14 governors were operating under the fourth Article 4 Section 4 of the Constitution,
[01:52:02.617 --> 01:52:03.317]  We're good to go.
[01:52:03.337 --> 01:52:03.637]  I think?
[01:52:28.686 --> 01:52:30.427]  Just like that battle I talked about.
[01:52:30.447 --> 01:52:31.028]  Three-sided.
[01:52:31.328 --> 01:52:36.091]  Hey, you bulged in with all this massive money and Soros money and bad guy money.
[01:52:36.271 --> 01:52:36.852]  Well, guess what?
[01:52:37.092 --> 01:52:39.013]  We the people beat you with a lot less resources.
[01:52:39.494 --> 01:52:40.815]  By the way, it's a busy day here.
[01:52:40.855 --> 01:52:43.537]  Tucker just sent me this link two minutes ago.
[01:52:44.497 --> 01:52:46.199]  Why I'm interviewing Vladimir Putin.
[01:52:46.259 --> 01:52:48.640]  So we'll all take a break at the break.
[01:52:49.141 --> 01:52:50.482]  It's a five-minute little segment.
[01:52:50.502 --> 01:52:50.982]  We're going to air this.
[01:52:51.002 --> 01:52:51.522]  Tucker Carlson.
[01:52:51.562 --> 01:52:52.643]  Tucker just sent this to me.
[01:52:52.663 --> 01:52:55.926]  Because I asked him, I said, did you get the Putin interview?
[01:52:55.946 --> 01:52:57.827]  And he just sent me this link.
[01:53:00.791 --> 01:53:01.431]  We're good to go.
[01:53:21.596 --> 01:53:22.136]  We're good to go.
[01:53:22.156 --> 01:53:22.296]  I think?
[01:53:39.585 --> 01:53:40.145]  We're good to go.
[01:53:55.416 --> 01:53:55.636]  Yeah.
[01:53:55.996 --> 01:54:02.180]  As Michael, Jan, and I both know, you know, Green Berets go out downrange behind enemy lines with 12 men and their force multipliers.
[01:54:02.501 --> 01:54:06.643]  So when I had most of my team, which were retired Green Berets, we understand what to do.
[01:54:06.663 --> 01:54:08.925]  I didn't even carry a weapon that day.
[01:54:08.985 --> 01:54:21.233]  I don't need to because all of this right here and this weapon, the mind, this verbal judo, this, you know, these are not... Because you already had the relationships, the background, the respect, and you had law enforcement who had the guns.
[01:54:21.273 --> 01:54:22.854]  You were the commander working with them.
[01:54:23.214 --> 01:54:23.554]  Yes, sir.
[01:54:23.594 --> 01:54:29.519]  So I was a liaison to the law enforcement, to the truckers, and honestly, it was just amazing to watch.
[01:54:29.599 --> 01:54:36.665]  And then, of course, I took a deep breath as everybody vacated the scene and drove away, and nothing happened from the Mike side or from Mexico.
[01:54:37.025 --> 01:54:38.026]  You've got to be pleased.
[01:54:38.046 --> 01:54:42.089]  And the reason I tell these stories, folks, is explaining people are looking for leadership.
[01:54:42.129 --> 01:54:44.231]  And the left, I didn't even know these groups were.
[01:54:44.291 --> 01:54:47.573]  Anonymous attacked us last week and a bunch of stuff when I defended you.
[01:54:48.474 --> 01:54:49.674]  Well, you're not getting orders.
[01:55:15.802 --> 01:55:18.624]  But from the Constitution and God, you see the attack.
[01:55:18.864 --> 01:55:20.645]  You know the Republic's under attack.
[01:55:20.865 --> 01:55:22.246]  This is the main battlefield.
[01:55:22.506 --> 01:55:24.607]  We haven't had to do this since 1776.
[01:55:24.988 --> 01:55:26.268]  This is the ultimate battle.
[01:55:26.489 --> 01:55:29.851]  And of course our military is now joining us to win.
[01:55:30.251 --> 01:55:31.151]  This is our country.
[01:55:31.972 --> 01:55:32.392]  Amen.
[01:55:33.333 --> 01:55:34.994]  Look, I'm just proud to be on the team.
[01:55:35.274 --> 01:55:38.776]  I happen to be the guy that's the face of this, but there are so many out there you'll never know.
[01:55:39.857 --> 01:55:42.578]  And I'm telling you, the left is shitting their britches right now.
[01:55:42.839 --> 01:55:43.219]  They should.
[01:55:44.278 --> 01:55:53.646]  Tell us a few more minutes about how great this was with the governors and hundreds, billions of dollars of news time that you guys got with this huge success.
[01:55:53.866 --> 01:55:54.066]  Right.
[01:55:54.106 --> 01:55:56.208]  So with Kristi Noem, she was from South Dakota.
[01:55:56.248 --> 01:56:00.391]  She came down and actually supported us originally on Operation Lone Star with some of her troops.
[01:56:00.832 --> 01:56:02.873]  And then they continued that relationship.
[01:56:03.254 --> 01:56:09.339]  The governor of Texas, Governor Stitt, I'm sorry, of Oklahoma, Governor Stitt, he was the first one to stand up and say, yeah, I'm with y'all.
[01:56:09.799 --> 01:56:10.179]  We're good to go.
[01:56:10.199 --> 01:56:10.419]  I think?
[01:56:32.069 --> 01:56:35.533]  Airboats on that river since the beginning of Operation Lone Star.
[01:56:35.553 --> 01:56:36.774]  We appreciate the Floridians.
[01:56:37.455 --> 01:56:43.301]  There are Floridians that are still down here now, just sitting at that camp, continuing to make sure she's safe.
[01:56:43.321 --> 01:56:55.213]  And all the people that poo-pooed us, we didn't poo-poo, we just said be careful, but some did, especially on the left, they look like fools now because this brought massive attention and it brought unity and an example for the states to link up again in the future.
[01:56:55.433 --> 01:57:00.021]  Those people that poo-pooed it, look, they're good people that make mistakes on analysis.
[01:57:00.401 --> 01:57:02.365]  But understand this, and this is the book that I look at.
[01:57:02.425 --> 01:57:03.527]  My field manual is the Bible.
[01:57:03.847 --> 01:57:07.193]  In Revelation 28.8, it says, number one, what God detests.
[01:57:07.433 --> 01:57:08.214]  That's the cowardly.
[01:57:09.332 --> 01:57:10.193]  God hates cowards.
[01:57:10.553 --> 01:57:10.894]  Yes, sir.
[01:57:11.635 --> 01:57:12.756]  Well, we've got to take action.
[01:57:12.796 --> 01:57:16.480]  Just as we've been set up and defeated before, doesn't mean we give up.
[01:57:17.381 --> 01:57:19.043]  I'd say we have 90% victory.
[01:57:19.404 --> 01:57:21.106]  So we can't just sit here on our asses.
[01:57:21.586 --> 01:57:23.909]  It's just one skirmish, if you will.
[01:57:23.929 --> 01:57:27.814]  We're going to continue to sink in, and we're going to keep them on their spurs.
[01:57:28.394 --> 01:57:34.039]  All right, the Tucker Carlson exclusive, I mean, exclusive, he sent it to me, it's out on X. I asked him, I said, what's going on here?
[01:57:34.119 --> 01:57:35.500]  I asked him an hour ago, here's the video.
[01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:44.447]  So Tucker's response, we'll come back to one more segment, you great Americans, and then we will bring in another great American to be in the studio with us.
[01:57:44.467 --> 01:57:44.867]  Stay with us.
[01:57:50.799 --> 01:57:50.919]  So,
[01:58:14.039 --> 01:58:22.260]  Well, I'm glad you mentioned that because it's methylfolate, the breakdown of folic acid, and a lot of people, particularly Europeans, don't absorb all of the folic acid.
[01:58:22.521 --> 01:58:23.621]  So it's not a stimulant.
[01:58:23.821 --> 01:58:27.241]  It's a totally natural thing that boosts energy that's foundational.
[01:58:27.521 --> 01:58:30.082]  And was I lying to you or did it not work?
[01:58:30.782 --> 01:58:31.962]  No, it was top-notch.
[01:58:32.022 --> 01:58:35.643]  And I was actually taking Red Pill Plus before, and that's got a little folic acid in it.
[01:58:35.683 --> 01:58:39.484]  I think there was a little buildup from this, but the energy from this was no jitters.
[01:58:39.664 --> 01:58:40.604]  I mean, it's top-notch.
[01:58:40.664 --> 01:58:41.404]  It's a great product.
[01:58:41.823 --> 01:58:42.765]  Well, thank you so much.
[01:58:42.825 --> 01:58:43.145]  Yeah, no.
[01:58:43.246 --> 01:58:46.571]  Folic acid's great and it's in real red pill, but some can't break it down.
[01:58:46.611 --> 01:58:47.633]  This is the breakdown of it.
[01:58:47.693 --> 01:58:48.374]  That's exactly it.
[01:58:49.395 --> 01:58:59.901]  Naturally sourced from the finest hemp plants in America, RebelZen offers the absolute finest quality CBD available and at the lowest prices.
[01:59:00.962 --> 01:59:15.551]  Extracted using a cold pressed technique to retain the molecular integrity of the cannabinoids and terpenes within the plant, this full spectrum formula ensures that your nervous system gets the full benefits of CBD.
[01:59:16.751 --> 01:59:26.679]  Premium quality organic CBD, like Rebel Zen, has been shown to naturally reduce anxiety, relieve pain, and decrease inflammation.
[01:59:27.159 --> 01:59:34.785]  People have reported a reduction in symptoms of insomnia, arthritis, seizures, chronic pain, and epilepsy.
[01:59:35.265 --> 01:59:41.890]  Several studies have shown it helps to reduce cortisol, increase serotonin, and boost vitality.
[01:59:42.771 --> 01:59:56.578]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:06.212 --> 02:00:07.453]  We're in Moscow tonight.
[02:00:07.473 --> 02:00:10.454]  We're here to interview the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin.
[02:00:10.514 --> 02:00:11.615]  We'll be doing that soon.
[02:00:12.375 --> 02:00:18.459]  There are risks to conducting an interview like this, obviously, so we've thought about it carefully over many months.
[02:00:18.959 --> 02:00:19.799]  Here's why we're doing it.
[02:00:20.700 --> 02:00:22.041]  First, because it's our job.
[02:00:22.341 --> 02:00:23.181]  We're in journalism.
[02:00:23.742 --> 02:00:25.623]  Our duty is to inform people.
[02:00:26.573 --> 02:00:31.916]  Two years into a war that's reshaping the entire world, most Americans are not informed.
[02:00:32.176 --> 02:00:38.119]  They have no real idea what's happening in this region, here in Russia or 600 miles away in Ukraine.
[02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:39.640]  But they should know.
[02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:44.003]  They're paying for much of it, in ways they might not fully yet perceive.
[02:00:45.043 --> 02:00:47.204]  The war in Ukraine is a human disaster.
[02:00:47.605 --> 02:00:55.449]  It's left hundreds of thousands of people dead, an entire generation of young Ukrainians, and it's depopulated the largest country in Europe.
[02:00:56.681 --> 02:00:59.102]  But the long-term effects are even more profound.
[02:01:00.043 --> 02:01:04.406]  This war has utterly reshaped the global military and trade alliances.
[02:01:05.299 --> 02:01:07.220]  And the sanctions that followed have as well.
[02:01:07.620 --> 02:01:10.340]  And in total, they have upended the world economy.
[02:01:11.241 --> 02:01:21.003]  The post-World War II economic order, the system that guaranteed prosperity in the West for more than 80 years, is coming apart very fast, and along with it, the dominance of the U.S.
[02:01:21.043 --> 02:01:21.403]  dollar.
[02:01:22.283 --> 02:01:23.804]  These are not small changes.
[02:01:23.864 --> 02:01:26.084]  They are history-altering developments.
[02:01:26.644 --> 02:01:28.525]  They will define the lives of our grandchildren.
[02:01:29.508 --> 02:01:31.270]  Most of the world understands this perfectly well.
[02:01:31.290 --> 02:01:31.970]  They can see it.
[02:01:32.430 --> 02:01:35.733]  Ask anyone in Asia or the Middle East what the future looks like.
[02:01:36.874 --> 02:01:40.597]  And yet the populations of the English-speaking countries seem mostly unaware.
[02:01:41.218 --> 02:01:43.099]  They think that nothing has really changed.
[02:01:43.419 --> 02:01:46.662]  And they think that because no one has told them the truth.
[02:01:47.463 --> 02:01:49.244]  Their media outlets are corrupt.
[02:01:49.524 --> 02:01:51.426]  They lie to their readers and viewers.
[02:01:51.946 --> 02:01:53.648]  And they do that mostly by omission.
[02:01:54.892 --> 02:02:05.655]  For example, since the day the war in Ukraine began, American media outlets have spoken to scores of people from Ukraine, and they have done scores of interviews with Ukrainian President Zelensky.
[02:02:06.435 --> 02:02:09.796]  We ourselves have put in a request for an interview with Zelensky, and we hope he accepts.
[02:02:10.576 --> 02:02:13.897]  But the interviews he's already done in the United States are not traditional interviews.
[02:02:14.597 --> 02:02:20.078]  They are fawning pep sessions specifically designed to amplify Zelensky's demand that the U.S.
[02:02:20.158 --> 02:02:23.579]  enter more deeply into a war in Eastern Europe and pay for it.
[02:02:24.790 --> 02:02:25.791]  That is not journalism.
[02:02:26.271 --> 02:02:27.572]  It is government propaganda.
[02:02:28.293 --> 02:02:31.215]  Propaganda of the ugliest kind, the kind that kills people.
[02:02:32.236 --> 02:02:45.726]  At the same time, our politicians and media outlets have been doing this, promoting a foreign leader like he's a new consumer brand, not a single Western journalist has bothered to interview the president of the other country involved in this conflict, Vladimir Putin.
[02:02:46.847 --> 02:02:51.050]  Most Americans have no idea why Putin invaded Ukraine, or what his goals are now.
[02:02:51.170 --> 02:02:52.091]  They've never heard his voice.
[02:02:53.031 --> 02:02:53.452]  That's wrong.
[02:02:54.676 --> 02:02:58.458]  Americans have a right to know all they can about a war they're implicated in.
[02:02:58.839 --> 02:03:02.141]  And we have the right to tell them about it because we are Americans too.
[02:03:02.801 --> 02:03:04.722]  Freedom of speech is our birthright.
[02:03:04.922 --> 02:03:07.164]  We were born with the right to say what we believe.
[02:03:07.884 --> 02:03:11.206]  That right cannot be taken away no matter who is in the White House.
[02:03:12.107 --> 02:03:13.127]  But they're trying anyway.
[02:03:13.848 --> 02:03:20.892]  Almost three years ago, the Biden administration illegally spied on our text messages and then leaked the contents to their servants in the news media.
[02:03:21.432 --> 02:03:23.934]  They did this in order to stop a Putin interview that we were planning.
[02:03:25.003 --> 02:03:28.284]  Last month, we're pretty certain they did exactly the same thing once again.
[02:03:28.884 --> 02:03:31.185]  But this time, we came to Moscow anyway.
[02:03:32.445 --> 02:03:34.726]  We are not here because we love Vladimir Putin.
[02:03:35.306 --> 02:03:40.268]  We are here because we love the United States, and we want it to remain prosperous and free.
[02:03:41.482 --> 02:03:42.782]  We paid for this trip ourselves.
[02:03:42.822 --> 02:03:44.663]  We took no money from any government or group.
[02:03:45.383 --> 02:03:47.224]  Nor are we charging people to see the interview.
[02:03:47.264 --> 02:03:48.484]  It is not behind a paywall.
[02:03:49.364 --> 02:03:55.746]  Anyone can watch the entire thing, shot live to tape and unedited, on our website, TuckerCarlson.com.
[02:03:56.626 --> 02:04:04.108]  Elon Musk, to his great credit, has promised not to suppress or block this interview once we post it on his platform, X. And we're grateful for that.
[02:04:05.410 --> 02:04:13.335]  Western governments, by contrast, will certainly do their best to censor this video on other less principled platforms because that's what they do.
[02:04:13.595 --> 02:04:15.896]  They are afraid of information they can't control.
[02:04:16.757 --> 02:04:18.718]  But you have no reason to be afraid of it.
[02:04:19.438 --> 02:04:23.161]  We are not encouraging you to agree with what Putin may say in this interview.
[02:04:23.721 --> 02:04:25.402]  But we are urging you to watch it.
[02:04:25.862 --> 02:04:27.783]  You should know as much as you can.
[02:04:28.143 --> 02:04:32.646]  And then, like a free citizen and not a slave, you can decide for yourself.
[02:04:33.487 --> 02:04:33.747]  Thanks.
[02:04:47.728 --> 02:04:48.631]  We're good to go.
[02:04:48.651 --> 02:04:48.972]  I think?
[02:05:00.031 --> 02:05:01.292]  Gunther in Tennessee.
[02:05:01.332 --> 02:05:02.373]  Thanks for calling, Gunther.
[02:05:02.534 --> 02:05:02.874]  Hey, Alex.
[02:05:03.074 --> 02:05:03.815]  First time caller.
[02:05:03.915 --> 02:05:05.757]  Real quick, wanted to plug your foundational energy.
[02:05:06.297 --> 02:05:07.258]  Just started taking that.
[02:05:07.939 --> 02:05:12.243]  And, boy, three pills, recommended dose, I was bouncing off the walls.
[02:05:12.363 --> 02:05:17.989]  But I tell you, foundational is the right name for that product because I'll cut down to one.
[02:05:19.090 --> 02:05:22.814]  It's like you have a baseline of energy that you were missing before that you got back.
[02:05:23.234 --> 02:05:31.497]  Well, I'm glad you mentioned that because it's methylfolate, the breakdown of folic acid, and a lot of people, particularly Europeans, don't absorb all of the folic acid.
[02:05:31.757 --> 02:05:32.837]  So it's not a stimulant.
[02:05:33.058 --> 02:05:36.479]  It's a totally natural thing that boosts energy that's foundational.
[02:05:36.759 --> 02:05:39.320]  And was I lying to you or did it not work?
[02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:41.200]  No, it was top-notch.
[02:05:41.261 --> 02:05:44.882]  And I was actually taking Red Pill Plus before, and that's got a little folic acid in it.
[02:05:44.922 --> 02:05:48.703]  I think there was a little buildup from this, but the energy from this was no jitters.
[02:05:48.903 --> 02:05:49.824]  I mean, it's top-notch.
[02:05:49.844 --> 02:05:50.644]  It's a great product.
[02:05:51.055 --> 02:05:52.016]  Well, thank you so much.
[02:05:52.056 --> 02:05:52.336]  Yeah, no.
[02:05:52.456 --> 02:05:55.798]  Folic acid's great and it's in real red pill, but some can't break it down.
[02:05:55.838 --> 02:05:56.858]  This is the breakdown of it.
[02:05:56.918 --> 02:06:09.585]  That's exactly it.
[02:06:10.566 --> 02:06:12.727]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:13.167 --> 02:06:14.528]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:24.551 --> 02:06:25.971]  Two heavy hitters here with us.
[02:06:26.932 --> 02:06:33.293]  Colonel and medical doctor Pete Chambers, Green Beret commander and the great Michael Leon, the top wartime correspondent in the world.
[02:06:33.313 --> 02:06:36.894]  We've got ten minutes left before Dr. Selah Emanuel comes in studio.
[02:06:36.974 --> 02:06:40.555]  So I'm going to have you guys have the floor and host us and make points.
[02:06:40.595 --> 02:06:42.936]  So you go ahead and interview Doc here.
[02:06:42.956 --> 02:06:43.716]  Go ahead.
[02:06:45.165 --> 02:06:45.405]  All right.
[02:06:45.445 --> 02:06:45.865]  Hey, Doc.
[02:06:45.965 --> 02:06:51.107]  Well, it looks like we've got control here for 10 minutes, so we better make the best of it.
[02:06:51.307 --> 02:06:54.008]  Well, we came a long way from Fort Bragg, didn't we?
[02:06:54.248 --> 02:06:55.228]  Yeah, we did.
[02:06:55.668 --> 02:06:58.869]  I mean, just what Alex just said, we're here to force multiply.
[02:06:59.189 --> 02:07:02.070]  I mean, we are Americans, and we're here to take our country.
[02:07:02.570 --> 02:07:06.151]  And, you know, interesting, Alex got here sitting on the desk this morning.
[02:07:08.072 --> 02:07:10.013]  He goes over a lot of news reports every day.
[02:07:10.053 --> 02:07:10.433]  Here's one.
[02:07:10.473 --> 02:07:16.215]  The World Economic Forum orders governments to demonetize citizens who believe in conspiracy theories.
[02:07:16.495 --> 02:07:21.217]  That's quite interesting because, you know, Coinbase, by the way, has seized my account.
[02:07:21.277 --> 02:07:21.837]  Coinbase.
[02:07:22.158 --> 02:07:25.179]  A lot of people say, well, why were you in Coinbase to begin with?
[02:07:25.519 --> 02:07:27.660]  Well, I was in Coinbase because some people...
[02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:29.161]  We're good to go.
[02:07:48.058 --> 02:07:48.679]  We're good to go.
[02:08:06.519 --> 02:08:13.963]  You know, he threw the Holocaust card when he was during his impeachment hearings and whatnot.
[02:08:14.103 --> 02:08:20.166]  I've been supplying information that can help with his impeachment, and as have you and others, and it's on.
[02:08:20.486 --> 02:08:22.107]  Doc, what do you have to say about all this?
[02:08:23.749 --> 02:08:24.570]  We have the floor here.
[02:08:24.810 --> 02:08:31.095]  Let's take it up a notch from the 40,000-foot view, and let's look at the spiritual, moral injury of a nation.
[02:08:32.637 --> 02:08:36.320]  The thing that's nearest to us is our soldiers, our veterans.
[02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:42.866]  And that right there, with us now pairing up and teaming up with, not just us, but across the nation,
[02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:56.810]  The Declaration of Military Accountability that happened on January 1st of this year at 0400 hours, that was signed by 231 participants and then a bunch of people that signed on the petition.
[02:08:57.270 --> 02:09:03.015]  That reflects of where the institution, our institution that we hold dear, is at.
[02:09:03.115 --> 02:09:05.437]  It's a moral injury that's taken place at the top.
[02:09:05.937 --> 02:09:11.242]  And as you and I both know, that have been led or led men in combat or in garrison,
[02:09:12.623 --> 02:09:15.805]  The atmosphere of the leadership trickles down.
[02:09:16.246 --> 02:09:23.371]  And we've got to really take a look at this because that accountability, that declaration of military accountability, that's just one institution.
[02:09:23.391 --> 02:09:29.916]  We've got so many more as you talk about energy and food and all these institutions that have been damaged and demoralized.
[02:09:30.396 --> 02:09:39.522]  That is the second and third order effects of what Besmanoff talked about back in the 80s, 90s, when he said, we will take down America from inside.
[02:09:39.982 --> 02:09:40.923]  We're seeing that now.
[02:09:40.943 --> 02:09:42.184]  This is that time.
[02:09:42.744 --> 02:09:44.886]  Here they go, talking about Alejandro Mayorkas.
[02:09:45.166 --> 02:09:46.367]  His name's not Alejandro.
[02:09:46.587 --> 02:09:47.948]  His name is Alex, right?
[02:09:48.268 --> 02:09:51.630]  He transitioned to Alejandro after...
[02:09:52.851 --> 02:09:54.452]  By the way, I want to say it again.
[02:09:55.132 --> 02:10:04.194]  Alex Mayorkas was a board member on HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, before he took over Department of Homeland Security, right?
[02:10:04.655 --> 02:10:11.457]  So we've got Catholic charities and the Lutheran refugee groups and all these others who are using various...
[02:10:12.637 --> 02:10:13.438]  Thank you.
[02:10:31.112 --> 02:10:31.592]  We're good to go.
[02:10:31.612 --> 02:10:32.072]  We're good to go.
[02:10:53.937 --> 02:10:54.878]  I think we're good to go.
[02:11:09.395 --> 02:11:14.757]  Right, and Michael, I'd like to add to that because on the tactical level of this thing on the ground...
[02:11:38.286 --> 02:11:38.906]  We're good to go.
[02:12:04.537 --> 02:12:11.863]  So we know that that connection is there, and that business has subsequently kept the flag down after a couple locals cut it down.
[02:12:12.644 --> 02:12:12.864]  Right.
[02:12:12.904 --> 02:12:14.665]  Yeah, you and I went to that flag.
[02:12:14.706 --> 02:12:15.486]  You took me to it.
[02:12:15.546 --> 02:12:15.866]  Yes, sir.
[02:12:15.886 --> 02:12:24.313]  You know, in downtown San Salvador, in El Salvador, I was just over there, they actually have a huge Chinese Communist Party flag in El Salvador.
[02:12:24.674 --> 02:12:29.578]  I mean, it's flying at this new library that the Chinese Communist Party just built in El Salvador.
[02:12:30.419 --> 02:12:35.148]  Yeah, the deepest seawater port in the Mediterranean is Piraeus, Greece, in the port of Athens.
[02:12:35.569 --> 02:12:36.170]  And that docking
[02:12:39.392 --> 02:12:45.534]  ...area is two-thirds owned, leased for the next 100 years by China, the deepest seawater port on the Mediterranean.
[02:12:45.974 --> 02:12:49.675]  A great deal of what's going on is about routes and energy, right?
[02:12:49.835 --> 02:12:51.196]  A lot of this is what's going on.
[02:12:51.236 --> 02:13:00.198]  For instance, that's why I focus so much on Panama and Netherlands and other places like this, because there's numerous layers of the war that's going on.
[02:13:00.678 --> 02:13:03.279]  A lot of people just focus on Israel versus Hamas.
[02:13:03.559 --> 02:13:06.300]  That's a parking lot fight compared to what's going on.
[02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:08.941]  We're talking about straight-up World War III is unfolding.
[02:13:09.382 --> 02:13:15.033]  I mean, the lockdown of three years in the third world, the UN admits starved 84 million people to death.
[02:13:15.354 --> 02:13:16.536]  That's not a blip on the radar screen.
[02:13:17.523 --> 02:13:18.124]  We're good to go.
[02:13:40.606 --> 02:13:41.807]  Really coming out of the woodwork here.
[02:13:42.427 --> 02:13:45.209]  You say it all the time on your show.
[02:13:45.509 --> 02:13:47.711]  The energy is moving to our side now.
[02:13:47.851 --> 02:13:48.471]  I can feel it.
[02:13:49.231 --> 02:13:50.953]  I've been on there 30 years.
[02:13:51.013 --> 02:13:53.594]  People used to say I was negative when we were getting our ass kicked.
[02:13:53.614 --> 02:13:54.875]  Now they're like, oh, you're being too positive.
[02:13:54.915 --> 02:13:56.196]  No, I'm white-pilled, baby.
[02:13:56.716 --> 02:13:57.317]  I can feel it.
[02:13:57.377 --> 02:13:58.618]  I feel the energy coming over.
[02:13:58.638 --> 02:14:03.462]  You know, when you're doing something big, you're fighting or whatever, you can feel the energy change in the system.
[02:14:03.802 --> 02:14:05.043]  We can feel the energy now.
[02:14:05.183 --> 02:14:06.084]  Oh, yeah.
[02:14:06.224 --> 02:14:07.245]  The energy is building.
[02:14:07.505 --> 02:14:08.285]  More and more people.
[02:14:08.325 --> 02:14:09.766]  We know the names of the enemies.
[02:14:10.047 --> 02:14:13.489]  But that means the enemy is going to really pull the stops out.
[02:14:13.509 --> 02:14:15.831]  Can you guys, in closing, speak to... You know...
[02:14:16.872 --> 02:14:18.773]  Colonel, we only have a minute left here.
[02:14:19.194 --> 02:14:21.275]  Lead us in a minute-long prayer right now.
[02:14:21.375 --> 02:14:23.396]  I don't think I know everything's God.
[02:14:23.697 --> 02:14:25.258]  If we don't have God on our side, we're done.
[02:14:25.358 --> 02:14:27.539]  We do have God, but we need to put it all on God.
[02:14:27.599 --> 02:14:28.280]  We can't do this.
[02:14:28.340 --> 02:14:28.920]  Only God can.
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:30.121]  Colonel, lead us in a one-minute prayer.
[02:14:30.161 --> 02:14:31.322]  I'll lead us in a one-minute prayer.
[02:14:31.342 --> 02:14:38.266]  Gracious Heavenly Father, we come before you today only servants and broken men, but Lord, we ask that you fill us with your Holy Spirit.
[02:14:38.286 --> 02:14:39.107]  Lord, we ask that you...
[02:14:41.172 --> 02:14:44.093]  Empty us of anything that is not humble.
[02:14:44.354 --> 02:14:48.636]  Lord, you give us the strength, you give us wisdom, and you teach us how to be left to bang.
[02:14:48.916 --> 02:14:53.398]  You've traded our hands for war with your powerful sword of the Spirit.
[02:14:53.738 --> 02:14:57.640]  And Lord, we ask you that we be penetrating in our truth.
[02:14:58.140 --> 02:14:59.441]  And Lord, we give these things to you.
[02:14:59.481 --> 02:15:00.361]  In Christ's name we pray.
[02:15:00.581 --> 02:15:00.861]  Amen.
[02:15:01.182 --> 02:15:01.822]  All right, beautiful.
[02:15:02.162 --> 02:15:03.202]  How do they find you, Colonel?
[02:15:03.242 --> 02:15:04.043]  How do they find you, Jan?
[02:15:05.024 --> 02:15:06.025]  I hope they don't find me.
[02:15:06.205 --> 02:15:09.687]  But I think probably drpchambers.com.
[02:15:10.167 --> 02:15:10.467]  All right.
[02:15:10.868 --> 02:15:14.570]  And I'm on X, just Michael underscore Jan, Yankee Oscar November.
[02:15:15.571 --> 02:15:16.071]  By the way.
[02:15:17.692 --> 02:15:21.015]  I've got so much evil happening right now to us, but so much good.
[02:15:21.115 --> 02:15:24.858]  Such good stuff's happening right now behind the scenes.
[02:15:25.359 --> 02:15:29.402]  I've got these other guests coming in, but I really should just leave with the stuff that I've just learned behind the scenes.
[02:15:29.883 --> 02:15:32.185]  A lot of people calling me right now, but I'm going to do the best I can.
[02:15:32.505 --> 02:15:34.106]  Gentlemen, thank you so much for all you're doing.
[02:15:34.627 --> 02:15:35.107]  Thank you, sir.
[02:15:35.167 --> 02:15:35.588]  Love you guys.
[02:15:35.608 --> 02:15:36.188]  I really appreciate it.
[02:15:37.109 --> 02:15:38.851]  All right, Dr. Stella Emanuel's coming in here.
[02:15:39.884 --> 02:15:42.307]  And I may just have her and Whiskey host us.
[02:15:42.868 --> 02:15:45.351]  I got some big stuff behind the scenes I got to deal with right now.
[02:15:45.812 --> 02:15:46.833]  But this is important, too.
[02:15:47.334 --> 02:15:48.636]  Stay with us at Infowars.com.
[02:15:58.472 --> 02:16:02.754]  29 years on air, all I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalist.
[02:16:03.454 --> 02:16:08.777]  And I've done the best job I can to tell the truth and the inaccurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[02:16:09.177 --> 02:16:15.620]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves, unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people.
[02:16:15.860 --> 02:16:16.540]  We don't do that.
[02:16:17.001 --> 02:16:18.881]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[02:16:19.282 --> 02:16:21.282]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product.
[02:16:21.342 --> 02:16:21.903]  It's so powerful.
[02:16:22.843 --> 02:16:32.915]  This is the breakdown product after your cells process it of folic acid, methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[02:16:33.356 --> 02:16:34.577]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[02:16:34.617 --> 02:16:35.498]  It's not a stimulant.
[02:16:35.738 --> 02:16:37.621]  It energizes your cells.
[02:16:38.121 --> 02:16:40.625]  And that everything else you take just supercharges it.
[02:16:40.665 --> 02:16:41.506]  It's so insane.
[02:16:41.847 --> 02:16:43.349]  It's foundational energy.
[02:16:43.810 --> 02:16:47.956]  The strongest formula out there at infowarsstore.com.
[02:16:48.356 --> 02:16:51.200]  It doesn't just energize this operation against the tyrants.
[02:16:51.280 --> 02:16:52.402]  It energizes you.
[02:16:52.682 --> 02:16:54.084]  Get foundational energy now.
[02:16:57.972 --> 02:16:59.233]  Bodies is back.
[02:16:59.373 --> 02:17:06.419]  The ultimate turmeric product on the market has returned to InfoWarsStore.com and is now 25% off for a limited time.
[02:17:06.779 --> 02:17:11.803]  Utilized for thousands of years, turmeric is one of the most studied medicinal herbs today.
[02:17:12.163 --> 02:17:19.829]  Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles are published every year on the chemistry and therapeutic potential of turmeric and its active components.
[02:17:20.129 --> 02:17:24.152]  But our super powerful extract using bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients in turmeric.
[02:17:43.007 --> 02:17:50.109]  No other product can compare with this curcuminoid delivery system, so if you want to put the true power of turmeric to the test, then look no further.
[02:17:50.349 --> 02:17:56.671]  Grab yourself a bottle today for 25% off at InfoWarsStore.com and put your body at ease.
[02:17:57.731 --> 02:18:01.472]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[02:18:01.792 --> 02:18:06.694]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump?
[02:18:08.123 --> 02:18:09.324]  Elon Musk, everybody else.
[02:18:09.725 --> 02:18:14.210]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[02:18:14.831 --> 02:18:16.973]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[02:18:17.273 --> 02:18:25.262]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's You Will Eat the Bugs.
[02:18:25.883 --> 02:18:27.205]  This is The Great Awakening.
[02:18:27.705 --> 02:18:31.609]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[02:18:32.090 --> 02:18:35.613]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[02:18:35.873 --> 02:18:38.416]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.
[02:18:38.756 --> 02:18:43.181]  Get your copy of The Great Awakening today at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:18:59.385 --> 02:19:01.047]  The Great Awakening at InfoWars Store.
[02:19:02.253 --> 02:19:08.778]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the global agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[02:19:09.038 --> 02:19:23.007]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections, masquerading as vaccines.
[02:19:23.948 --> 02:19:28.071]  It is so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives oblivious
[02:19:29.594 --> 02:19:30.415]  We're good to go.
[02:20:00.020 --> 02:20:04.101]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:20:04.641 --> 02:20:05.962]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:12.163 --> 02:20:14.964]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[02:20:15.184 --> 02:20:15.544]  You think?
[02:20:15.584 --> 02:20:16.104]  Just let me think.
[02:20:16.124 --> 02:20:21.705]  I suspect even now orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[02:20:21.745 --> 02:20:22.586]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[02:20:23.066 --> 02:20:23.646]  Damn it!
[02:20:23.746 --> 02:20:24.066]  Why?
[02:20:24.826 --> 02:20:27.747]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation...
[02:20:31.389 --> 02:20:34.536]  Words are for the means to meaning and for those who listen.
[02:20:37.185 --> 02:20:42.168]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[02:20:42.188 --> 02:20:43.208]  You designed it, sir.
[02:20:43.228 --> 02:20:44.149]  You wanted it foolproof.
[02:20:44.169 --> 02:20:45.549]  You told me every television in London.
[02:20:45.810 --> 02:20:47.290]  Cruelty and injustice.
[02:20:47.370 --> 02:20:49.251]  Intolerance and depression.
[02:20:49.732 --> 02:20:59.697]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance, coercing your conformity and selecting your submission.
[02:20:59.717 --> 02:21:00.277]  We need cameras.
[02:21:00.577 --> 02:21:01.378]  How did this happen?
[02:21:02.038 --> 02:21:02.819]  Who's to blame?
[02:21:03.759 --> 02:21:06.401]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[02:21:06.421 --> 02:21:08.383]  They will be held accountable.
[02:21:08.783 --> 02:21:14.208]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[02:21:15.416 --> 02:21:17.177]  I know why you did it.
[02:21:17.417 --> 02:21:18.478]  I know you were afraid.
[02:21:18.918 --> 02:21:19.639]  Who wouldn't be?
[02:21:20.139 --> 02:21:20.659]  War?
[02:21:20.899 --> 02:21:21.300]  Terror?
[02:21:21.540 --> 02:21:22.200]  Disease?
[02:21:22.840 --> 02:21:28.684]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[02:21:29.284 --> 02:21:35.028]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[02:21:35.668 --> 02:21:41.832]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[02:21:48.851 --> 02:21:49.772]  It is a war.
[02:21:50.233 --> 02:21:51.214]  It's happening now.
[02:21:52.116 --> 02:21:53.918]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[02:21:54.479 --> 02:21:56.302]  The time to choose sides has come.
[02:21:57.063 --> 02:21:58.525]  We are the resistance.
[02:21:58.986 --> 02:22:00.548]  We are the Infowar.
[02:22:17.425 --> 02:22:20.540]  All right, Dr. Stella Emanuel is our guest in studio.
[02:22:21.468 --> 02:22:24.170]  We had technical issues when she was on this a few weeks ago, so I asked her to come up here.
[02:22:25.391 --> 02:22:26.612]  Houston, and she's with us.
[02:22:26.632 --> 02:22:27.672]  She's a great medical doctor.
[02:22:27.692 --> 02:22:34.417]  One of the first to come out against the shot, come out against the lie, and come out with the therapeutics that she's been vindicated.
[02:22:34.837 --> 02:22:38.320]  But I wanted to get her on here to talk about Disease X. They're saying it's imminent, it's coming.
[02:22:38.680 --> 02:22:39.861]  You're in all this gain of function.
[02:22:39.901 --> 02:22:45.985]  And then we see record deaths happening, the life expectancy dropping from the shots, from all of it.
[02:22:46.005 --> 02:22:47.666]  The people don't know how to protect themselves.
[02:22:48.046 --> 02:22:50.228]  This is all about action and how to protect yourself.
[02:22:50.788 --> 02:22:51.609]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:52.230 --> 02:22:54.193]  So, Dr. Stella Emanuel, great to have you here in studio.
[02:22:54.393 --> 02:22:56.175]  Always a pleasure, Alex.
[02:22:56.896 --> 02:22:58.498]  I think the American people need to wake up.
[02:22:58.538 --> 02:23:00.020]  Not just the American people, the world.
[02:23:00.080 --> 02:23:02.344]  Because we are in a battle, in a war.
[02:23:02.884 --> 02:23:06.068]  And like I said, you deal with info wars and we're going up the borders.
[02:23:06.109 --> 02:23:06.890]  And that's not words.
[02:23:06.970 --> 02:23:07.771]  We're in a war.
[02:23:07.811 --> 02:23:08.512]  We're in a war.
[02:23:08.732 --> 02:23:09.413]  This is real.
[02:23:09.453 --> 02:23:20.847]  We're in a serious war and they are trying to destroy humanity and humanity needs to wake up with that mindset of we are in a war and live your life with preparation that you are in a war.
[02:23:21.288 --> 02:23:23.370]  You know, you heard about disease X and um...
[02:23:24.051 --> 02:23:25.793]  This started in 2018.
[02:23:25.973 --> 02:23:29.136]  They just wanted to put a placemaker for a pandemic that will come.
[02:23:29.817 --> 02:23:31.979]  WHO is talking about that there will be a pandemic.
[02:23:32.079 --> 02:23:33.180]  Remember how she laughed?
[02:23:33.260 --> 02:23:34.722]  Oh, Trump's going to get challenged.
[02:23:34.742 --> 02:23:36.263]  Yes.
[02:23:36.504 --> 02:23:37.465]  They are not stopping.
[02:23:37.605 --> 02:23:41.028]  This is an election year, and they're going to try to bring some kind of pandemic.
[02:23:41.048 --> 02:23:44.672]  There was an article that was written.
[02:23:44.712 --> 02:23:45.232]  This was like...
[02:23:46.670 --> 02:23:48.611]  There was an article in December.
[02:23:48.851 --> 02:23:53.013]  They talked about how... By the way, you know I've got a family emergency right now, so just go ahead and notice.
[02:23:53.033 --> 02:23:53.433]  Is that okay?
[02:23:53.633 --> 02:23:53.833]  Yes.
[02:23:53.853 --> 02:23:54.394]  All right, go ahead.
[02:23:54.534 --> 02:23:55.234]  I'm not disrespecting.
[02:23:55.254 --> 02:23:55.474]  Go ahead.
[02:23:55.634 --> 02:24:04.839]  Yes, they said there was going to be an article that is going... They wrote an article about declaration of federal registrar declaration for public readiness for Ebola and Marburg.
[02:24:04.919 --> 02:24:06.259]  And that's kind of crazy.
[02:24:06.639 --> 02:24:08.940]  Why would they get up and start talking about Ebola and Marburg?
[02:24:08.981 --> 02:24:10.261]  This was November 27, 2023.
[02:24:12.242 --> 02:24:25.211]  And then, of course, December 19, there was an article in Market Watch about a Texas Biomed lab that is already at a phase two clinical trials for vaccine against Marburg and Ebola.
[02:24:25.631 --> 02:24:26.752]  And this was in San Antonio.
[02:24:27.172 --> 02:24:30.094]  And, of course, where did they do this training?
[02:24:30.114 --> 02:24:37.059]  They did volunteers from Kenya and from Uganda so that they can try and use them to talk about Marburg and Ebola.
[02:24:37.239 --> 02:24:40.181]  Why is the country talking about Marburg and Ebola?
[02:24:40.641 --> 02:24:41.882]  I would say this about,
[02:24:42.402 --> 02:24:42.903]  We're good to go.
[02:25:05.678 --> 02:25:06.539]  We're good to go.
[02:25:20.982 --> 02:25:21.222]  Thank you.
[02:25:47.077 --> 02:25:47.457]  We're good to go.
[02:26:10.166 --> 02:26:15.571]  And they are sensitive to not just zinc, but to something like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.
[02:26:15.971 --> 02:26:24.378]  That is why my cry, my scream to everybody in America listening to my voice is that make sure you have hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin in your medicine cabinet.
[02:26:24.678 --> 02:26:32.745]  Whether you go across to Mexico and get it, or you go on our website and do a telemedicine appointment and get it, or you go to your, wherever, but just make sure that you are prepared.
[02:26:33.837 --> 02:26:34.457]  We're good to go.
[02:27:03.348 --> 02:27:03.608]  I think?
[02:27:28.929 --> 02:27:35.212]  Except, of course, they do some kind of genetic modification on the thing to make it more infective.
[02:27:35.592 --> 02:27:37.672]  Most times they cannot become true pandemics.
[02:27:37.993 --> 02:27:39.153]  But they are floating it.
[02:27:39.813 --> 02:27:43.775]  The government is also talking about disease X. The WHO, everybody are talking about disease X.
[02:27:45.876 --> 02:27:47.637]  Disease X is not a particular disease.
[02:27:48.018 --> 02:27:49.759]  Disease X is whatever they plan to do.
[02:27:50.459 --> 02:27:57.643]  In fact, they said COVID was the first Disease X. It's a placeholder for some pandemic that will happen.
[02:27:57.743 --> 02:28:05.788]  And Tedros, the head of WHO, said about 20% of people are going to die from this new pandemic.
[02:28:06.208 --> 02:28:10.170]  So I don't know what they are talking about, but Disease X is not a real disease.
[02:28:10.610 --> 02:28:13.052]  It's a placeholder for whatever it is that they are going to release.
[02:28:13.632 --> 02:28:17.142]  But let me keep everybody, like I said, I'm not here to scare you.
[02:28:17.182 --> 02:28:19.107]  I'm here to get you with a preparation mindset.
[02:28:20.376 --> 02:28:28.881]  I want to tell everybody, regardless of what diseases these demons bring up, remember that they don't want their families to die, and they themselves don't want to die.
[02:28:29.161 --> 02:28:36.145]  So they will always have a solution hidden somewhere, and it is our job to find this solution and tell people before it really happens.
[02:28:36.585 --> 02:28:41.948]  So when you start hearing about disease X, don't get scared, don't get frightened, don't get all combobulated.
[02:28:42.328 --> 02:28:43.749]  Just be prepared medically.
[02:28:43.809 --> 02:28:44.610]  That's right.
[02:28:44.630 --> 02:28:45.930]  Dr. Stella Emanuel, stay there.
[02:28:47.131 --> 02:28:47.772]  We're live.

[02:34:14.272 --> 02:34:18.276]  Can stock up on ivermectin and all these other things.
[02:34:18.776 --> 02:34:19.597]  And I can't tell you.
[02:34:19.617 --> 02:34:22.059]  I bought it from you before I was working with you.
[02:34:22.119 --> 02:34:22.820]  I knew you for years.
[02:34:22.880 --> 02:34:24.361]  But I've stockpiled it.
[02:34:24.401 --> 02:34:25.162]  I just hand it out.
[02:34:25.762 --> 02:34:27.604]  This is so important to be ready.
[02:34:28.104 --> 02:34:31.907]  Record-level deaths going on from the shots and from all the things going on.
[02:34:32.408 --> 02:34:34.089]  And they just keep it on the back burner now.
[02:34:34.490 --> 02:34:35.951]  People don't know what to do.
[02:34:36.011 --> 02:34:39.294]  So, Dr. Stella, talk about the products and what you think people should do to protect themselves.
[02:34:39.918 --> 02:34:45.342]  I think every, like I always say that everybody needs to have hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin in their medicine cabinet.
[02:34:45.662 --> 02:34:48.565]  It's not something that you should wait till you get sick.
[02:34:48.825 --> 02:34:50.386]  And you explain in Africa, everybody has it.
[02:34:50.546 --> 02:34:50.826]  Yes.
[02:34:51.047 --> 02:34:52.948]  Africa had the lowest death rate from COVID.
[02:34:52.968 --> 02:34:55.550]  From COVID, yes, because they have it in the medicine cabinet.
[02:34:55.590 --> 02:34:56.711]  They have it over the counter.
[02:34:57.091 --> 02:34:58.973]  But here, you cannot get it over the counter.
[02:34:58.993 --> 02:35:06.779]  So the best thing is to, you go on our website, you make a telemedicine appointment, and then you get hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin in your medicine cabinet.
[02:35:07.299 --> 02:35:18.988]  Before, you know, there was an article that came out in the NIH that on January 7th, Zika, that hydroxychloroquine actually works to treat Zika virus.
[02:35:19.088 --> 02:35:22.451]  By the way, my doctor, I'm not going to say his name, he owns clinics all over Texas.
[02:35:22.491 --> 02:35:26.014]  He's like, you know, triple medical doctor and a scientist.
[02:35:27.686 --> 02:35:36.251]  I've been going to him for like six, seven years, and they have been pushing the last two years just to routinely take Avramectin, all the things you've been saying.
[02:35:36.371 --> 02:35:36.871]  Yes.
[02:35:36.931 --> 02:35:37.851]  The science is clear now.
[02:35:37.971 --> 02:35:38.152]  Yes.
[02:35:38.572 --> 02:35:44.115]  So what I advise, what I do, I've been taking weekly hydroxychloroquine for four years.
[02:35:44.175 --> 02:35:45.175]  I've really not gotten sick.
[02:35:45.555 --> 02:35:46.256]  That's a low dose.
[02:35:46.276 --> 02:35:47.676]  My dad used to get sick the whole time.
[02:35:47.696 --> 02:35:48.137]  Never got sick now.
[02:35:48.157 --> 02:35:48.517]  Low dose, yes.
[02:35:48.757 --> 02:35:49.877]  Just a very low dose.
[02:35:49.937 --> 02:35:52.718]  It doesn't affect your heart when you take that low dose.
[02:35:52.758 --> 02:35:53.258]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:35:53.518 --> 02:35:56.639]  People that have lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, they are taking it for years.
[02:35:57.039 --> 02:35:58.619]  Some people take weekly hydroxy.
[02:35:58.639 --> 02:36:00.039]  Some people take weekly ivermectin.
[02:36:00.279 --> 02:36:02.980]  I have hundreds of thousands of people... And my dad takes two little pills a week.
[02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:03.340]  Yes.
[02:36:03.760 --> 02:36:09.621]  You know, Medscape did an article on me that I was the highest prescriber of hydroxychloroquine ever made in the country.
[02:36:10.102 --> 02:36:11.402]  Hey, yeah, because I am...
[02:36:12.282 --> 02:36:18.444]  Telling people be safe, do not sit down and wait for what is Ebola or Zika or whatever.
[02:36:18.744 --> 02:36:23.045]  Because, like I said, these things are single-stranded RNA viruses.
[02:36:23.105 --> 02:36:24.785]  What does ivermectin do that blocks it?
[02:36:25.445 --> 02:36:27.486]  Ivermectin works in many, many ways.
[02:36:27.966 --> 02:36:32.087]  One of the things that ivermectin does is it functions as an ionophore.
[02:36:32.387 --> 02:36:34.528]  It opens channels and allows zinc in.
[02:36:34.888 --> 02:36:37.248]  It destroys, it stops replication of the virus.
[02:36:37.268 --> 02:36:38.869]  So zinc kills viruses, it opens the channel?
[02:36:38.909 --> 02:36:39.089]  Yes.
[02:36:39.469 --> 02:36:40.569]  So it opens the door.
[02:36:40.770 --> 02:36:41.390]  It opens the door.
[02:36:41.670 --> 02:36:45.611]  Hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, quercetin, they all open the door for zinc to go into the cell.
[02:36:45.952 --> 02:36:50.733]  But ivermectin also works later because it stops replication of the virus.
[02:36:51.374 --> 02:36:55.435]  It actually stops the virus from clinging to your cells and staying there.
[02:36:55.695 --> 02:36:57.616]  So it works in many, many ways.
[02:36:57.656 --> 02:37:01.637]  This little molecule called ivermectin does a whole lot of things.
[02:37:01.757 --> 02:37:05.279]  And we've known for years how great these medicines are.
[02:37:05.859 --> 02:37:10.800]  In fact, there are articles even on NIH about ivermectin and cancer.
[02:37:11.140 --> 02:37:12.160]  I mean, I don't treat cancer.
[02:37:12.240 --> 02:37:13.421]  I'm not an oncologist.
[02:37:13.721 --> 02:37:16.661]  But if you go on NIH and put ivermectin on cancer, you will see articles.
[02:37:16.681 --> 02:37:19.722]  Well, that's what hurt them three or four years ago is they would say it doesn't work.
[02:37:20.022 --> 02:37:22.963]  You could go there and there was hundreds of studies on their own website.
[02:37:23.143 --> 02:37:24.283]  On the NIH website.
[02:37:24.623 --> 02:37:26.343]  There are hundreds of studies.
[02:37:26.763 --> 02:37:28.184]  They're just hoping you don't look it up.
[02:37:28.344 --> 02:37:28.524]  Yes.
[02:37:28.904 --> 02:37:33.305]  You know, when they started talking about Ebola, of course, I'd like to go on NIH website and dig up.
[02:37:34.125 --> 02:37:41.949]  I found an article about proteases and peptides that help to break the outer shell of the Ebola virus.
[02:37:42.409 --> 02:37:44.831]  And that's why we put together what I call Viral Immune Plus.
[02:37:45.311 --> 02:37:54.776]  This thing has all these peptides and proteases that will help break the cell of the virus and build your immunity against all of the viruses.
[02:37:54.796 --> 02:37:55.296]  What's the name again?
[02:37:55.777 --> 02:37:57.558]  You know, remember you like this one, the Viral Immune Plus?
[02:37:57.578 --> 02:37:58.298]  No, it tastes good.
[02:37:58.318 --> 02:37:59.018]  Yes, it tastes good.
[02:37:59.358 --> 02:37:59.819]  So more...
[02:38:00.535 --> 02:38:07.237]  And then Covilite has vitamin C, vitamin D, has quercetin, has narc, has all this stuff in it.
[02:38:07.497 --> 02:38:14.159]  So that way, when you take them, it kind of builds your immunity and stops you from being able to get sick.
[02:38:14.639 --> 02:38:15.919]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:38:16.179 --> 02:38:18.360]  The ingredients in your products are amazing.
[02:38:18.940 --> 02:38:21.762]  Yeah, so that's why I tell people, don't wait until you get sick.
[02:38:22.302 --> 02:38:24.083]  Stop taking supplements now.
[02:38:24.103 --> 02:38:27.645]  It's not just about hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.
[02:38:27.685 --> 02:38:30.507]  It's to make sure your vitamin D levels are up.
[02:38:30.787 --> 02:38:34.009]  If you notice, Alex, that people get a lot of viruses during the winter.
[02:38:34.029 --> 02:38:34.109]  Yeah.
[02:38:34.289 --> 02:38:38.633]  Because during the winter, there's no sun, people hide in their homes, and their vitamin D levels are down.
[02:38:39.013 --> 02:38:44.578]  So when we have, if you have our product, Covivites, it has vitamins C, D, zinc, and quercetin.
[02:38:44.938 --> 02:38:47.200]  So you can have everything that you need to stay healthy.
[02:38:47.300 --> 02:38:48.802]  And this stuff works.
[02:38:48.842 --> 02:38:52.565]  This is not something that people should wait and say, no, no, no, we're going to wait until next week.
[02:38:52.625 --> 02:38:53.746]  My dad was almost dead.
[02:38:53.826 --> 02:38:54.347]  It saved him.
[02:38:54.887 --> 02:38:57.209]  Yes, so people should stop and say no.
[02:38:57.729 --> 02:39:05.354]  I've had people, I had a lady, a young lady pregnant, 30 weeks and sick, and they were just looking at her and waiting for her to die.
[02:39:05.854 --> 02:39:16.320]  And then I brought her in, gave her breathing treatment with budesonide, put her on hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, which we give to pregnant women, we give to newborn babies, we give to old people.
[02:39:16.781 --> 02:39:18.182]  These are safe drugs.
[02:39:18.202 --> 02:39:18.342]  So,
[02:39:19.002 --> 02:39:21.684]  America, don't wait till you get sick.
[02:39:21.824 --> 02:39:25.346]  Don't wait till they throw some crazy virus and you're running helter-skelter.
[02:39:25.806 --> 02:39:26.646]  Be prepared now.
[02:39:26.706 --> 02:39:30.748]  And by the way, you are totally vindicated with all the other doctors and scientists.
[02:39:31.449 --> 02:39:32.770]  All these treatments were real.
[02:39:32.810 --> 02:39:33.790]  They tried to suppress it.
[02:39:33.830 --> 02:39:34.350]  It's come out.
[02:39:34.390 --> 02:39:34.891]  They're evil.
[02:39:35.171 --> 02:39:36.051]  They're evil.
[02:39:36.191 --> 02:39:36.932]  These people are evil.
[02:39:37.512 --> 02:39:38.193]  That's the bottom line.
[02:39:38.233 --> 02:39:43.317]  They are very evil and their whole thing is they want... Look at what the wars is to kill people.
[02:39:44.197 --> 02:39:46.499]  They are trying to stop food production, right?
[02:39:46.519 --> 02:39:50.743]  You know about the farmers in Europe that are rioting right now because they want to bring famine.
[02:39:51.123 --> 02:39:52.744]  Right now, the war in Ukraine and Russia.
[02:39:52.804 --> 02:39:55.666]  Russia and Ukraine were the greatest producer of wheat and grains.
[02:39:55.727 --> 02:39:57.608]  You understand what I'm saying?
[02:39:57.888 --> 02:40:00.871]  So the war actually just pushes famine all over the world.
[02:40:01.271 --> 02:40:03.112]  If you read in the book of Revelation, chapter 6...
[02:40:04.013 --> 02:40:07.475]  The third seal is famine.
[02:40:07.856 --> 02:40:09.296]  The second seal is a sword.
[02:40:09.557 --> 02:40:11.758]  But what is the first seal in Revelation 6, Alex?
[02:40:12.378 --> 02:40:17.201]  They said it was a crown and a jab, which is actually a crown.
[02:40:17.261 --> 02:40:18.102]  A crown is corona.
[02:40:18.602 --> 02:40:24.026]  The Bible talks about it that, you know, the first horse went out and he was given a crown, which is corona.
[02:40:24.446 --> 02:40:27.990]  And it predicts the green horse of pestilence.
[02:40:41.423 --> 02:40:44.205]  The fourth horse is famine, pestilence, death, and all that stuff.
[02:40:44.265 --> 02:40:45.165]  And we are seeing it.
[02:40:45.565 --> 02:40:47.806]  We're seeing young people die of cancers.
[02:40:48.107 --> 02:40:50.628]  We are seeing young people get... They admit it's all exploding.
[02:40:50.688 --> 02:40:52.409]  It's all just coming through.
[02:40:52.909 --> 02:40:57.451]  This is what I tell people if you've been vaccinated and you took the vaccine and you made a mistake.
[02:40:58.332 --> 02:40:58.932]  Just repent.
[02:40:58.972 --> 02:41:00.793]  If you go on our website, there's a whole thing we do there.
[02:41:00.833 --> 02:41:01.794]  Repent and pray.
[02:41:02.274 --> 02:41:03.595]  This stuff is Luciferous.
[02:41:04.480 --> 02:41:09.883]  Alex, inside the COVID vaccine, the biomarker is Luciferus.
[02:41:10.083 --> 02:41:11.503]  Go look in the Moderna website.
[02:41:11.603 --> 02:41:13.004]  That's the patent.
[02:41:13.324 --> 02:41:15.905]  Yes, but I tell you what, Luciferus is Lucifer.
[02:41:16.245 --> 02:41:20.127]  And anything that is the devil, at the mention of the name of Jesus, it can be uprooted.
[02:41:20.507 --> 02:41:22.708]  So we've prayed for people... Oh, you're not just saying this.
[02:41:22.788 --> 02:41:23.589]  All the studies show that...
[02:41:24.289 --> 02:41:26.570]  People that pray beat cancer more.
[02:41:26.790 --> 02:41:33.074]  Yes, we've prayed for people that took the vaccine and we prayed for them and they got healed from heart disease.
[02:41:33.134 --> 02:41:39.897]  I mean, we had a program in front of one of these hospitals in Houston.
[02:41:41.698 --> 02:41:42.199]  We're good to go.
[02:42:08.860 --> 02:42:09.601]  We're good to go.
[02:42:24.501 --> 02:42:31.284]  1 Peter 3, verse 5 says, Salvation is by the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost.
[02:42:31.944 --> 02:42:36.406]  What happened in the Garden of Eden was a DNA corruption, a spiritual DNA corruption.
[02:42:36.666 --> 02:42:39.667]  That is why we all come down from that lineage and we're all crazy as human beings.
[02:42:40.307 --> 02:42:43.508]  But when you pray, you regenerate your DNA.
[02:42:43.528 --> 02:42:44.929]  So you deal with the spiritual part.
[02:42:45.109 --> 02:42:45.809]  You're baptized.
[02:42:46.129 --> 02:42:46.369]  Yes.
[02:42:46.909 --> 02:42:47.249]  Stay there.
[02:42:47.269 --> 02:42:49.130]  Dr. Silla Emanuel is on fire.
[02:42:50.531 --> 02:42:51.211]  Hallelujah.
[02:42:57.708 --> 02:43:01.230]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[02:43:01.631 --> 02:43:08.655]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[02:43:08.815 --> 02:43:10.817]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[02:43:11.017 --> 02:43:12.057]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[02:43:12.077 --> 02:43:12.798]  He loved the idea.
[02:43:13.138 --> 02:43:16.639]  What would you call the debate and discussion about a pro-human future?
[02:43:16.679 --> 02:43:17.540]  Team Humanity?
[02:43:17.620 --> 02:43:18.500]  Yes, Team Humanity.
[02:43:18.660 --> 02:43:19.100]  Absolutely.
[02:43:19.400 --> 02:43:20.801]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[02:43:20.861 --> 02:43:24.342]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[02:43:24.542 --> 02:43:31.965]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to give Infowars on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[02:43:32.225 --> 02:43:43.969]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a revolution against the globalists, and it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[02:43:44.249 --> 02:43:45.570]  We're told humans are the problem.
[02:43:45.590 --> 02:43:46.590]  We're told we're killing the Earth.
[02:43:46.870 --> 02:43:51.132]  We're told all this garbage so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[02:43:51.432 --> 02:43:52.132]  We're not going to do that.
[02:43:52.392 --> 02:43:57.034]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[02:43:58.638 --> 02:44:01.539]  Have you tried taking the Real Red Pill?
[02:44:01.739 --> 02:44:07.581]  A one-of-a-kind heart and brain formula designed exclusively for InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:44:07.781 --> 02:44:12.442]  One of the most powerful ingredients in Real Red Pill Plus is pregnenolone.
[02:44:12.682 --> 02:44:20.625]  Pregnenolone levels decrease with age, and low levels are associated with fatigue, low brain function, and unhealthy aging.
[02:44:20.825 --> 02:44:24.746]  The Real Red Pill Plus also provides essential trace minerals,
[02:44:25.086 --> 02:44:25.746]  We're good to go.
[02:44:58.911 --> 02:45:02.034]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:45:02.054 --> 02:45:03.575]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:45:04.356 --> 02:45:07.399]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:45:08.280 --> 02:45:16.367]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:45:17.208 --> 02:45:25.015]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:45:26.013 --> 02:45:28.894]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:45:28.914 --> 02:45:34.656]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:45:35.457 --> 02:45:36.377]  I know you spread the word.
[02:45:36.397 --> 02:45:37.878]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[02:45:37.918 --> 02:45:38.438]  Keep doing it.
[02:45:38.478 --> 02:45:46.761]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[02:45:47.421 --> 02:45:51.003]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:45:51.703 --> 02:45:56.347]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Enforcement.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:45:56.668 --> 02:45:57.509]  Please take action now.
[02:45:58.229 --> 02:45:59.030]  Winter is coming.
[02:45:59.670 --> 02:46:00.431]  Winter is coming.
[02:46:00.631 --> 02:46:01.732]  Winter is coming.
[02:46:02.113 --> 02:46:02.893]  Winter is coming.
[02:46:03.194 --> 02:46:04.255]  Winter is coming!
[02:46:05.293 --> 02:46:06.814]  Winter is coming.
[02:46:07.114 --> 02:46:08.514]  Winter isn't coming.
[02:46:09.095 --> 02:46:10.375]  Winter is here.
[02:46:10.775 --> 02:46:18.278]  And while the sun isn't helping us produce as much vitamin D, do yourself a favor and try InfoWars Life Winter Sun Plus.

[02:46:59.031 --> 02:47:03.132]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:47:03.632 --> 02:47:04.972]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:08.333 --> 02:47:13.594]  If you think gun control or something like that is going to change a terrorist's point of view, I think you're, like, out of your mind.
[02:47:14.374 --> 02:47:17.215]  You may think you've got me worried about what you're going to do.
[02:47:17.235 --> 02:47:19.955]  Dude, you're about to find out what I'm going to do.
[02:47:20.015 --> 02:47:21.696]  And that's going to worry you a lot more.
[02:47:21.716 --> 02:47:24.716]  Although, if you don't step aside, we'll tear you apart.
[02:47:27.257 --> 02:47:28.217]  You die first, kid.
[02:47:29.594 --> 02:47:33.744]  Your friends might get me in a rush, but not before I make your head into a canoe, you understand me?
[02:47:34.766 --> 02:47:35.989]  Who's bluffing with Russian?
[02:47:36.109 --> 02:47:36.209]  No!
[02:47:37.691 --> 02:47:39.972]  You're not as stupid as you look.
[02:47:40.672 --> 02:47:44.534]  Yeah, I don't understand the concepts of conversation of the gun culture.
[02:47:44.994 --> 02:47:49.657]  We've lived with guns since, what, the 7th century or something, I don't know.
[02:47:49.757 --> 02:47:55.479]  We all know that right now, guns is a code, it's a metaphor, that disenfranchised white guys need.
[02:47:55.539 --> 02:47:57.080]  It makes them feel good because they're being proud.
[02:47:57.100 --> 02:47:58.441]  You can say what you want, I don't agree with that.
[02:47:58.481 --> 02:47:59.842]  There's a big difference between fantasy land...
[02:48:01.062 --> 02:48:03.084]  In reality, Fantasyland is what we do.
[02:48:03.104 --> 02:48:06.086]  Doing a movie, doing a television show, that's Fantasyland.
[02:48:06.206 --> 02:48:07.587]  And that's where that stuff belongs.
[02:48:07.707 --> 02:48:14.752]  In reality, when we're dealing with things like terrorism and whatnot, we're all going to have different opinions on how to do it, how to deal with it.
[02:48:14.912 --> 02:48:18.154]  Mine happens to be that I think there's a very strong reason.
[02:48:18.634 --> 02:48:19.255]  Founding fathers.
[02:48:19.895 --> 02:48:27.918]  ...had for the Second Amendment, and that is that no government ever hasn't had to fight its own people, and its own people hasn't had to fight its own government.
[02:48:27.938 --> 02:48:28.678]  So what are you going to do?
[02:48:29.099 --> 02:48:29.639]  Outlaw everything?
[02:48:29.939 --> 02:48:30.699]  That isn't the answer.
[02:48:30.919 --> 02:48:34.421]  Just put some... Put some controls?
[02:48:34.681 --> 02:48:38.882]  What, so the people who want to defend themselves can't?
[02:48:39.202 --> 02:48:40.383]  No, not so you can't.
[02:48:40.423 --> 02:48:42.024]  Just so the idiots can't get home.
[02:48:42.104 --> 02:48:44.144]  Do you really believe they're not going to?
[02:48:44.264 --> 02:48:45.305]  Are you serious about that?
[02:48:45.925 --> 02:48:46.726]  Are you serious?
[02:48:47.167 --> 02:48:48.208]  What's good with that?
[02:48:48.548 --> 02:48:50.690]  Oh my God.
[02:48:50.711 --> 02:48:51.772]  We had our Civil War.
[02:48:52.272 --> 02:49:01.042]  If that Second Amendment hadn't been there, those people would not have had the opportunity to do what they considered was defending their life, their way, their job, their living.
[02:49:01.683 --> 02:49:03.525]  So I agree with that.
[02:49:03.625 --> 02:49:07.209]  I think that's an important part of our existence, and it's basically that simple.
[02:49:11.030 --> 02:49:15.438]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:49:15.858 --> 02:49:20.506]  Yeah, InfoWars.com, our ex-channel, banned out video, are on fire!
[02:49:21.499 --> 02:49:25.260]  And I had great Doc Chambers and Michael Yon in last hour.
[02:49:25.420 --> 02:49:27.000]  And you can feel the momentum shift.
[02:49:27.020 --> 02:49:27.740]  You can feel the victory.
[02:49:28.160 --> 02:49:30.681]  Doesn't mean we're winning the war yet, but we're winning the battles now.
[02:49:30.701 --> 02:49:40.822]  Dr. Selim Emanuel, before we get into protecting ourselves, the great products you've got at DrSelimEmanuel.com, the promo code Alex supports the show, supports everybody.
[02:49:41.322 --> 02:49:41.842]  360 win.
[02:49:42.303 --> 02:49:45.423]  You lead major prayer revivals out of your ranch.
[02:49:45.443 --> 02:49:46.363]  You're a woman of God.
[02:49:46.383 --> 02:49:47.843]  I can feel the Holy Spirit with you right now.
[02:49:48.384 --> 02:49:50.804]  Talk about God and the fight we're against and lead us in some prayer.
[02:49:52.361 --> 02:49:54.783]  We are doing a monthly delivery service.
[02:49:54.843 --> 02:50:00.707]  And the reason why we do that is because a lot of people are fighting a battle that is spiritual and they don't know how to fight back.
[02:50:01.187 --> 02:50:04.770]  So we have a ranch just outside Patterson.
[02:50:04.830 --> 02:50:05.731]  It's about two hours from here.
[02:50:06.351 --> 02:50:08.132]  And people come there and they stay for free.
[02:50:08.392 --> 02:50:11.755]  They come three, four, five days and they stay there and we pray with them.
[02:50:11.815 --> 02:50:17.279]  And they deal with depression, drug addiction, just a lot of spiritual stuff that people cannot handle by themselves.
[02:50:17.759 --> 02:50:18.339]  We're good to go.
[02:50:18.359 --> 02:50:18.600]  I think?
[02:50:43.112 --> 02:50:45.473]  And he calls me all the time, talking about Jesus and crying.
[02:50:45.533 --> 02:50:46.414]  I mean, it's real.
[02:50:46.914 --> 02:50:50.396]  And literally, the day he gave his life to God, everything changed the next day.
[02:50:50.616 --> 02:50:51.216]  Yes, yes.
[02:50:51.276 --> 02:50:52.337]  I speak to Roger all the time.
[02:50:52.377 --> 02:50:53.937]  He's amazing.
[02:50:53.957 --> 02:50:55.178]  So you know how he is.
[02:50:55.238 --> 02:50:55.498]  Yes.
[02:50:55.578 --> 02:51:01.501]  We've started, because the election is coming and it's going to be crazy, we started doing a space at 8 p.m.
[02:51:01.641 --> 02:51:06.644]  at night on X to actually pray for the election, pray for President Trump.
[02:51:06.684 --> 02:51:08.525]  If you go on my X handle...
[02:51:10.066 --> 02:51:11.066]  Go on my ex-handle.
[02:51:11.086 --> 02:51:13.527]  You can actually sign up to come for the speech.
[02:51:13.588 --> 02:51:14.488]  And what is your ex-handle?
[02:51:15.308 --> 02:51:17.530]  Stella underscore Emmanuel.
[02:51:18.110 --> 02:51:18.490]  Beautiful.
[02:51:18.850 --> 02:51:21.052]  So that we can pray for the election.
[02:51:21.152 --> 02:51:26.695]  Pray for these demons and pray for them to... We're supposed to pray for them, not hate them.
[02:51:28.376 --> 02:51:29.598]  They want the hate back.
[02:51:30.739 --> 02:51:33.062]  Jesus said give them love, heaps of coals on their backs.
[02:51:33.343 --> 02:51:34.864]  It depends whether they are human or not.
[02:51:35.145 --> 02:51:37.468]  If they are human, we love them and bring them to Christ.
[02:51:37.568 --> 02:51:42.294]  If they are non-human, and a lot of them are non-human, we release the fire of God to consume them.
[02:51:42.714 --> 02:51:44.677]  Explain that, and then talk about
[02:51:46.587 --> 02:51:51.229]  Talk about why they fear Trump so much.
[02:51:52.109 --> 02:51:52.729]  He's not perfect.
[02:51:52.769 --> 02:51:53.230]  I'm not either.
[02:51:53.590 --> 02:51:56.191]  They legitimately are scared of him and Tucker Carlson.
[02:51:56.471 --> 02:51:57.091]  And they're scared of me.
[02:51:57.171 --> 02:51:57.691]  They're scared of you.
[02:51:57.751 --> 02:51:58.592]  What is it they're scared of?
[02:51:59.432 --> 02:52:04.694]  They don't want people that are going to stand and bring the people to... for people's minds to open.
[02:52:05.254 --> 02:52:06.856]  I tell people there are a lot of Christians.
[02:52:06.876 --> 02:52:08.417]  So the thing is we're not afraid of what they're afraid of.
[02:52:08.557 --> 02:52:09.318]  Yes.
[02:52:09.818 --> 02:52:11.339]  I tell people about President Trump.
[02:52:11.359 --> 02:52:15.463]  They're like, well, President Trump, whether he's a Christian or not, that doesn't matter.
[02:52:15.523 --> 02:52:16.544]  We're not looking for a pastor.
[02:52:16.584 --> 02:52:17.445]  He's been risen up.
[02:52:17.796 --> 02:52:19.077]  We're not even looking for a pastor.
[02:52:19.477 --> 02:52:20.878]  We're looking for a presidency.
[02:52:21.298 --> 02:52:26.882]  God calls people in a position of leadership, like the Pharaoh in the days of Joseph.
[02:52:26.902 --> 02:52:29.303]  So many times he calls somebody that isn't even good.
[02:52:29.343 --> 02:52:34.206]  Yes, Nebuchadnezzar was... The fourth chapter of Daniel was written by Nebuchadnezzar.
[02:52:34.406 --> 02:52:38.669]  Nebuchadnezzar was a Babylonian king, and Cyrus was called a servant of God.
[02:52:38.969 --> 02:52:41.331]  So whether Trump is a Christian or not, it doesn't matter.
[02:52:41.371 --> 02:52:42.531]  And I know he is.
[02:52:42.731 --> 02:52:43.992]  At least he's Presbyterian.
[02:52:44.032 --> 02:52:46.594]  But what you're saying is if God chooses you, you don't have a choice.
[02:52:46.614 --> 02:52:46.674]  Yes.
[02:52:46.994 --> 02:52:50.056]  God chooses people all the time to work.
[02:52:50.136 --> 02:52:53.458]  And you can see that the anointing of the president... That happened to me.
[02:52:53.538 --> 02:52:56.460]  I was always a Christian, but God literally said, you're doing this.
[02:52:56.760 --> 02:53:00.162]  You know that President Trump has the anointing of the president.
[02:53:00.182 --> 02:53:00.902]  You can see it.
[02:53:02.183 --> 02:53:02.764]  You could see it.
[02:53:02.824 --> 02:53:03.766]  He's a king.
[02:53:03.846 --> 02:53:04.707]  Yes.
[02:53:04.787 --> 02:53:05.989]  The anointing is upon him.
[02:53:06.249 --> 02:53:08.873]  It's not on Biden, the bumbling fool that we have in the White House.
[02:53:08.893 --> 02:53:09.414]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:53:09.834 --> 02:53:14.241]  And we have to pray if we're going to be able to bring God's plan for the nation.
[02:53:14.521 --> 02:53:15.402]  The Lord told us yes.
[02:53:15.422 --> 02:53:17.946]  So that's why they're so scared is they can see the anointing.
[02:53:18.186 --> 02:53:25.968]  Yes, and they know that he knows what they are doing, and he has a call to actually dismantle their system.
[02:53:26.008 --> 02:53:26.968]  That's why they're scared of him.
[02:53:27.248 --> 02:53:29.709]  And that's why no weapon formed against him prospers.
[02:53:29.909 --> 02:53:31.589]  Yes, no matter what they do.
[02:53:31.889 --> 02:53:36.390]  Because when God anoints you and calls you, he protects you, and it doesn't matter.
[02:53:36.610 --> 02:53:39.971]  They tried to destroy me, but I still rise, because they didn't call me.
[02:53:40.231 --> 02:53:41.592]  They tried to silence me.
[02:53:41.752 --> 02:53:42.552]  They didn't give me my...
[02:53:43.052 --> 02:53:46.093]  I'm talking about filling the Holy Spirit together, when the brethren get together.
[02:53:46.433 --> 02:53:47.653]  I can feel God's will.
[02:53:47.713 --> 02:53:48.333]  It's not even me.
[02:53:48.393 --> 02:53:49.474]  It's like, you're doing this.
[02:53:49.694 --> 02:53:52.454]  Once you just submit to His will, then you do what He needs to do.
[02:53:52.674 --> 02:53:55.075]  There are people God is calling in this time, and guess what?
[02:53:55.495 --> 02:53:56.435]  People are coming to the Lord.
[02:53:56.455 --> 02:53:58.296]  Look at Joe Rogan, already reading the Bible.
[02:53:58.516 --> 02:53:59.356]  You all need to lead him to Christ.
[02:53:59.376 --> 02:54:02.577]  No, he's suddenly talking about... Somebody needs to lead him to Christ.
[02:54:02.837 --> 02:54:03.417]  He's coming there.
[02:54:04.417 --> 02:54:05.918]  Yeah, because he's reading the Bible and talking.
[02:54:05.938 --> 02:54:07.540]  I'm like, Jorgen, reading the Bible and cussing?
[02:54:07.780 --> 02:54:10.142]  But somebody needs to just truly lead him to Christ.
[02:54:10.403 --> 02:54:13.806]  Because there are people like him that have been called, that are waiting.
[02:54:13.826 --> 02:54:15.267]  He'll be like Saul of Tarsus.
[02:54:15.347 --> 02:54:15.848]  Yes!
[02:54:16.248 --> 02:54:18.971]  Jorgen will be on fire once they lead him to Christ.
[02:54:19.031 --> 02:54:20.292]  So, can you guys do it, please?
[02:54:21.141 --> 02:54:21.661]  I'm trying.
[02:54:21.681 --> 02:54:24.163]  Can you imagine Joe Rogan once he gets the Holy Spirit?
[02:54:24.323 --> 02:54:26.445]  I'll be praying for him that he will give his life to Christ.
[02:54:26.465 --> 02:54:28.566]  Because he's beginning to get it.
[02:54:28.846 --> 02:54:34.970]  He's talking about Gilgamesh and talking about the Tower of Babel and talking about Revelation 6 and the Mark of the Beast.
[02:54:34.990 --> 02:54:36.271]  And he has guests on about God now.
[02:54:36.311 --> 02:54:40.474]  Yes, so he needs to, once God finally just connects with him.
[02:54:40.494 --> 02:54:41.855]  It's like, come to the flame, join us.
[02:54:42.235 --> 02:54:44.517]  Yes, even, what's his name, the British guy?
[02:54:44.577 --> 02:54:45.757]  He's talking about Jesus now.
[02:54:45.777 --> 02:54:47.038]  He's talking about God.
[02:54:47.118 --> 02:54:47.599]  What's his name?
[02:54:47.939 --> 02:54:51.081]  He used to be in Hollywood and now he's a British podcaster.
[02:54:51.341 --> 02:54:51.821]  Russell Brand.
[02:54:51.841 --> 02:54:52.441]  Russell Brand.
[02:54:52.681 --> 02:54:55.382]  Russell Brand is like... I was on the show for three hours.
[02:54:55.422 --> 02:54:56.622]  He just sat there and listened to me.
[02:54:56.983 --> 02:54:58.563]  And he said, no, I believe in God now.
[02:54:58.643 --> 02:54:59.043]  Yes!
[02:54:59.263 --> 02:55:02.844]  I mean, so God... This whole battle is calling... Because you see it.
[02:55:02.884 --> 02:55:03.724]  It's all spiritual.
[02:55:03.744 --> 02:55:06.205]  People know that evil is coming.
[02:55:06.585 --> 02:55:08.726]  And what can solve evil is God.
[02:55:09.166 --> 02:55:12.247]  And if you are there and you don't know what to do... That's right.
[02:55:12.347 --> 02:55:13.947]  Evil is coming because we forgot God.
[02:55:14.187 --> 02:55:15.348]  Yes, that is why.
[02:55:15.849 --> 02:55:17.030]  Call on the name of Jesus.
[02:55:17.070 --> 02:55:21.334]  You see, whenever people turn away from God, God gave them into captivity.
[02:55:21.395 --> 02:55:23.657]  God gave them to the hands of their enemies.
[02:55:24.237 --> 02:55:28.182]  So, Father, I just want to pray for everybody listening to the sound of my voice.
[02:55:28.722 --> 02:55:33.267]  That the veil will come off your mind and you will see the glorious light of the gospel.
[02:55:33.767 --> 02:55:35.589]  I pray for the church to wake up.
[02:55:52.603 --> 02:55:53.124]  We're good to go.
[02:56:14.318 --> 02:56:15.078]  We're good to go.
[02:56:15.098 --> 02:56:16.078]  We're good to go.
[02:56:16.098 --> 02:56:16.618]  We're good to go.
[02:56:43.863 --> 02:56:46.106]  And I pray that the blood will be released on our behalf.
[02:56:46.266 --> 02:56:47.208]  In Jesus' name.
[02:56:47.388 --> 02:56:47.729]  Amen.
[02:56:48.990 --> 02:56:50.112]  That blood's unstoppable.
[02:56:50.192 --> 02:56:50.452]  Yes.
[02:56:50.713 --> 02:56:52.355]  The blood of Jesus will be released.
[02:56:53.510 --> 02:56:54.191]  Hallelujah.
[02:56:54.771 --> 02:56:57.814]  Alex, I just pray for God's hand of protection upon you.
[02:56:58.375 --> 02:57:12.768]  The Bible says that Jerusalem was a city without walls, that God would build a wall of fire, that God would build a wall of fire around you, release angels to watch over you and protect you, and just give you wisdom to do the work that you're doing.
[02:57:12.788 --> 02:57:13.829]  I can feel it.
[02:57:13.909 --> 02:57:15.771]  Yes, and his hand will be upon your life.
[02:57:15.791 --> 02:57:16.712]  I pray for you all the time.
[02:57:16.752 --> 02:57:17.473]  I'm sure you know that.
[02:57:17.933 --> 02:57:18.233]  I know.
[02:57:18.273 --> 02:57:18.753]  Thank you so much.
[02:57:18.793 --> 02:57:21.774]  When I see something going, I'm like, oh, God, protect Alex.
[02:57:22.094 --> 02:57:22.734]  Watch over him.
[02:57:23.314 --> 02:57:25.155]  And, you know, so we just have to pray.
[02:57:25.235 --> 02:57:26.655]  And that is why we start doing that.
[02:57:27.095 --> 02:57:27.415]  8 p.m.
[02:57:27.475 --> 02:57:31.416]  on Sunday nights, we're going to have, we're going to be praying till the election.
[02:57:31.777 --> 02:57:32.677]  Praying for the election.
[02:57:32.997 --> 02:57:35.477]  Praying to, you know, to set confusion.
[02:57:35.497 --> 02:57:37.298]  And that's why they try to shut down the churches.
[02:57:37.458 --> 02:57:37.738]  Yes.
[02:57:38.038 --> 02:57:39.538]  Set confusion and expose them.
[02:57:39.558 --> 02:57:40.059]  All right.
[02:57:40.079 --> 02:57:41.019]  We'll come right back.
[02:57:41.219 --> 02:57:41.519]  Wow.

[02:58:49.808 --> 02:58:50.329]  Thank you.
[02:58:50.529 --> 02:58:53.072]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[02:58:53.152 --> 02:58:54.413]  I started taking that stuff.
[02:58:54.453 --> 02:58:57.636]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[02:58:57.756 --> 02:58:58.657]  When did you start taking it?
[02:58:58.938 --> 02:59:02.962]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure, and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[02:59:03.022 --> 02:59:03.302]  Mm-hmm.
[02:59:03.542 --> 02:59:06.244]  And I started eating a little better, but my blood pressure stayed high.
[02:59:06.264 --> 02:59:13.789]  And when I took the X2 iodine after about three or four weeks, I think my body was detoxified of a bunch of metals and stuff that my body was storing.
[02:59:13.889 --> 02:59:16.111]  And my blood pressure came down to the perfect level.
[02:59:16.491 --> 02:59:19.413]  And I tell people the only thing I did was X2 iodine.
[02:59:19.793 --> 02:59:20.393]  I think we're good.
[02:59:48.982 --> 02:59:54.904]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:07.766 --> 03:00:09.707]  Dr. Stella, explain it to people right now.
[03:00:09.747 --> 03:00:11.247]  Explain what we're really facing.
[03:00:11.267 --> 03:00:11.507]  Go ahead.
[03:00:11.527 --> 03:00:13.808]  Say what you were saying during the break.
[03:00:14.348 --> 03:00:15.528]  Yeah, I'm saying that right.
[03:00:15.588 --> 03:00:18.369]  We're dealing with an invasion from an outer world.
[03:00:18.409 --> 03:00:21.530]  You know, in 2012, we had this 100-day prayer program.
[03:00:21.830 --> 03:00:23.450]  We prayed for 100 days non-stop.
[03:00:24.430 --> 03:00:34.313]  On day 99, I had a dream, and these people came, and they said they were genetically modified human beings, and it was not their time yet that when it's their time, they would manifest.
[03:00:34.853 --> 03:00:38.577]  It's just the days of Noah.
[03:00:38.617 --> 03:00:39.378]  In 2016, the world would change.
[03:00:40.019 --> 03:00:44.303]  So do you know in June 2016, that's when CERN opened that hydrocollider?
[03:00:44.764 --> 03:00:45.605]  And something came out.
[03:00:46.005 --> 03:00:48.989]  Because if you read in the book of Revelation chapter 9, it talks about...
[03:00:50.830 --> 03:00:55.211]  That there's going to be an invasion where locusts will come from the underworld.
[03:00:55.311 --> 03:00:56.251]  The gates of hell will be open.
[03:00:56.271 --> 03:00:57.231]  The gates of hell will be open.
[03:00:57.691 --> 03:01:02.292]  And on that place that they are talking about is that the king over there will be Apollo, Apollyon.
[03:01:02.712 --> 03:01:04.112]  But guess where CERN is built?
[03:01:04.452 --> 03:01:05.713]  On the temple of Apollo.
[03:01:06.393 --> 03:01:07.473]  So this stuff is real.
[03:01:07.533 --> 03:01:09.333]  And they did satanic rituals when it opened.
[03:01:09.533 --> 03:01:15.334]  Yes, and not only that, it has the image of Shriva, the god of destruction, in front of CERN.
[03:01:15.854 --> 03:01:17.755]  Guess where the internet came from?
[03:01:17.815 --> 03:01:18.475]  The World Wide Web.
[03:01:19.068 --> 03:01:19.649]  From CERN.
[03:01:20.309 --> 03:01:21.470]  www, guess what?
[03:01:22.011 --> 03:01:24.092]  www actually means 666.
[03:01:24.533 --> 03:01:35.882]  So, and, you know, in the days of Noah, you know, after Noah, when they built the Tower of Babel, they wanted to connect all human beings to have one language and do things together.
[03:01:35.922 --> 03:01:43.569]  So right now, with the www World Wide Web, they are trying to connect all of us so that we can do things together and have that hive mind and demonic mindset.
[03:01:43.929 --> 03:01:45.630]  And that is why the web started.
[03:01:45.791 --> 03:01:46.992]  And that is part of their plan.
[03:01:47.532 --> 03:01:51.995]  So in 2012, the Lord showed me that there were going to be people among us that are non-humans.
[03:01:52.375 --> 03:02:10.527]  If you read in the book of Revelation, chapter 13, verse 14, it said that the devil would deceive human beings, that they will make images onto the devil, and the devil will have power to give breath to these images, that the images will be able to speak.
[03:02:11.107 --> 03:02:13.728]  And cause those that will not take the mark to be destroyed.
[03:02:14.188 --> 03:02:15.728]  So what are images?
[03:02:15.968 --> 03:02:18.228]  Images is like clones or images.
[03:02:18.349 --> 03:02:21.569]  So they were going to make images, something that is non-human.
[03:02:21.889 --> 03:02:25.490]  And the devil will be able to give breath to this image.
[03:02:25.890 --> 03:02:31.331]  And this image will start forcing people to kill people, forcing them to take jobs and all kinds of things.
[03:02:31.711 --> 03:02:33.832]  So there are people among us that are non-human.
[03:02:33.912 --> 03:02:35.232]  And human beings need to know that.
[03:02:35.732 --> 03:02:42.498]  If you read in the book of Daniel chapter 2 verse 43, it talks about the last kingdom is going to be iron mixed with clay.
[03:02:42.818 --> 03:02:46.121]  It's going to be humans, which is clay, and iron, which is machine.
[03:02:46.501 --> 03:02:50.284]  And we hear right now about all kinds of people trying to mix iron with machine.
[03:02:50.645 --> 03:02:59.232]  Yuval Noah says that the next race, in the next few years, humans are not going to be in charge of the world, but they're going to be a different race.
[03:02:59.732 --> 03:03:01.454]  So I started saying this in 2020.
[03:03:02.975 --> 03:03:03.415]  I think?
[03:03:24.654 --> 03:03:35.462]  If they put Luciferus in you, the Bible says in Titles 3 verse 5 that salvation is by the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost.
[03:03:35.843 --> 03:03:37.344]  So we have a prayer on our website.
[03:03:37.364 --> 03:03:40.386]  If you go to drstellarmd.com, you will see there, did you take the jab?
[03:03:40.446 --> 03:03:41.347]  Do you regret it?
[03:03:41.907 --> 03:03:44.648]  All you have to do is repent and tell God, I'm sorry.
[03:03:44.668 --> 03:03:45.729]  I was deceived.
[03:03:45.789 --> 03:03:46.509]  I was fearful.
[03:03:46.549 --> 03:03:47.389]  I needed my job.
[03:03:47.689 --> 03:03:50.290]  But right now, I'm coming back to you in repentance.
[03:03:50.671 --> 03:03:56.813]  The same way we repent to be saved is the same way you repent for this job to be taken out of your system spiritually.
[03:03:57.333 --> 03:03:59.754]  So when you pray, we have the prayers.
[03:03:59.794 --> 03:04:01.956]  You pray for the blood of Jesus to flow through you.
[03:04:02.216 --> 03:04:04.337]  You pray for a regeneration of your DNA.
[03:04:04.497 --> 03:04:05.838]  And like I said, we've seen miracles.
[03:04:06.418 --> 03:04:14.923]  When you finish that prayer, then the next thing you do, we have a vax detox to help you deal with the physical effect of the vaccine, of the jab.
[03:04:14.943 --> 03:04:19.085]  So if you go on our website and you get the vax detox, it will help you to deal with the physical effect.
[03:04:19.365 --> 03:04:22.267]  But the most thing you need to do is deal with the spiritual effect.
[03:04:22.887 --> 03:04:27.869]  When the Bible says that we're in a time in the last days, it's going to be like in the days of Noah.
[03:04:28.129 --> 03:04:29.269]  What happened in the days of Noah?
[03:04:29.549 --> 03:04:31.790]  There were Nephilim, there were non-humans among us.
[03:04:32.210 --> 03:04:41.393]  Some of this evil that they are doing, when you see a grown-up man dressed with diapers and tutu and dancing in front of a two-year-old child, they cannot possibly be human.
[03:04:41.733 --> 03:04:45.014]  So if we realize that we're dealing with non-humans... And they dress up like aliens.
[03:04:45.154 --> 03:04:46.376]  Yes, they dress up like aliens.
[03:04:46.416 --> 03:04:47.558]  They look like aliens.
[03:04:47.578 --> 03:04:48.299]  I get the clown.
[03:04:48.419 --> 03:04:49.180]  I look like aliens.
[03:04:49.240 --> 03:04:49.841]  I get the clown.
[03:04:49.861 --> 03:04:52.004]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds with Ursula Emanuel.
[03:04:52.024 --> 03:04:52.465]  Stay with us.
[03:04:52.886 --> 03:04:53.607]  UrsulaEmanuelMD.com.
[03:04:58.442 --> 03:05:05.569]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large.
[03:05:06.130 --> 03:05:13.898]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep support formula, Down and Out, is just the thing.
[03:05:14.678 --> 03:05:21.045]  It's our new faster absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[03:05:21.713 --> 03:05:22.514]  We're good to go.
[03:05:40.874 --> 03:05:45.517]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will be down and out.
[03:06:02.213 --> 03:06:06.095]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:06:06.215 --> 03:06:14.120]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:16.598 --> 03:06:17.940]  Michelle Emanuel is our guest.
[03:06:17.960 --> 03:06:18.821]  We're still here in the break.
[03:06:18.881 --> 03:06:20.443]  Joe Rogan needs to give his life to Jesus.
[03:06:20.483 --> 03:06:22.907]  He's talking about God, the devil now.
[03:06:23.427 --> 03:06:30.477]  It's a bigger trip than DMT, folks, to meet Christ and the Holy Spirit and give him the discernment, the connection to infinity.
[03:06:33.200 --> 03:06:39.803]  I was going to have a great guest in here, but I've got not a bad family emergency, but a family emergency I have to deal with.
[03:06:41.144 --> 03:06:44.086]  I rarely punch out early to go deal with it, but I've got to deal with this.
[03:06:45.107 --> 03:06:47.788]  And so hopefully I'll be back tomorrow, but this is all going down.
[03:06:47.808 --> 03:06:48.789]  So I'm going to air...
[03:06:49.795 --> 03:06:52.277]  The incredible Alex Jones-Tucker Carlson interview was part of it.
[03:06:53.198 --> 03:06:54.419]  Tucker sent us a clip earlier.
[03:06:54.439 --> 03:06:55.960]  Yeah, he's got the Putin interview.
[03:06:56.601 --> 03:06:57.882]  He's building the suspense for that.
[03:06:57.902 --> 03:07:00.504]  I asked him today, I said, did you get it?
[03:07:00.524 --> 03:07:01.484]  And he sent me this clip.
[03:07:02.085 --> 03:07:02.966]  So that's coming up.
[03:07:03.066 --> 03:07:05.828]  We're going to put that on X right now, or it's already up there right now.
[03:07:06.228 --> 03:07:08.250]  But Dr. Stella, in the nine minutes we have left,
[03:07:10.345 --> 03:07:15.528]  I'm proud to have you on here exposing the evil, but also we're not just pitching something.
[03:07:15.588 --> 03:07:23.391]  We want to pitch things that empower you, that make you healthier and wiser and better, and plus you want to get it again.
[03:07:23.411 --> 03:07:30.475]  I never thought of this from an evil perspective, but if the evil sells something that doesn't work, like a Chinese product, why would you want that?
[03:07:30.495 --> 03:07:34.777]  I want to sell something that is known for quality because you want to get it again.
[03:07:34.817 --> 03:07:35.957]  I want a relationship with you.
[03:07:36.318 --> 03:07:36.578]  You've got...
[03:07:37.418 --> 03:07:41.619]  Telemedicine for stuff you can't get over the counter, but you've got also the best supplements ever.
[03:07:42.039 --> 03:07:43.379]  Talk about the products right now.
[03:07:44.500 --> 03:07:50.681]  We, over the past four years, have gone from not just being a doctor, but being a doctor that also do natural medicine.
[03:07:51.021 --> 03:08:00.883]  In fact, one of the things that we've added on our website is medicinal herbs, like moringa, curcumin, turmeric, ginger, and you can drink them in a tea and you get healthy.
[03:08:01.563 --> 03:08:03.344]  DrStellaMD.com.
[03:08:03.384 --> 03:08:05.646]  Yes, and if they use promo code Alex, they get a discount.
[03:08:06.326 --> 03:08:14.991]  When they talk about Ebola and Zika and all this stuff, you see these two supplements right here, Covilite and Varioimmune Plus?
[03:08:15.651 --> 03:08:17.833]  These two are something you mix and drink.
[03:08:18.823 --> 03:08:19.944]  We're good to go.
[03:08:45.265 --> 03:08:45.845]  We're good to go.
[03:09:11.238 --> 03:09:12.379]  We're good to go.
[03:09:12.479 --> 03:09:12.880]  I think?
[03:09:35.760 --> 03:09:36.520]  We're good to go.
[03:09:51.926 --> 03:09:55.588]  Most important, get hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin in your medicine cabinet today.
[03:09:56.128 --> 03:09:59.710]  Alex, we have something called seven antibiotics you will need in an emergency.
[03:10:00.070 --> 03:10:01.591]  What if supply chains go down?
[03:10:01.611 --> 03:10:04.752]  At least you have antibiotics for different kinds of infections.
[03:10:05.113 --> 03:10:07.454]  You need a telemedicine appointment to do that.
[03:10:07.494 --> 03:10:11.016]  You need to go on our website, make a telemedicine appointment.
[03:10:11.256 --> 03:10:16.358]  We will see you, look at your medical information, and prescribe this stuff to you.
[03:10:16.738 --> 03:10:19.520]  And our mom and pop pharmacists all over the country will ship it to you.
[03:10:20.180 --> 03:10:28.483]  Please, please, don't wait till they throw Zika or they throw Ebola or they throw some kind of different strain of COVID and then you're suffering.
[03:10:28.743 --> 03:10:30.924]  Today, today, be prepared.
[03:10:30.984 --> 03:10:32.244]  That is my cry.
[03:10:32.845 --> 03:10:36.806]  When you're prepared medically, you're not scared of whatever it is they're going to bring.
[03:10:37.306 --> 03:10:38.447]  Be prepared spiritually.
[03:10:38.487 --> 03:10:39.467]  Give your life to Jesus.
[03:10:39.967 --> 03:10:41.207]  Call on the name of Jesus.
[03:10:41.448 --> 03:10:42.368]  Read your Bible.
[03:10:42.568 --> 03:10:43.548]  Know God for yourself.
[03:10:43.948 --> 03:10:44.969]  So that way you're not...
[03:10:45.469 --> 03:10:46.029]  We're good to go.
[03:11:09.128 --> 03:11:09.949]  We're good to go.
[03:11:26.567 --> 03:11:26.908]  I think?
[03:11:41.667 --> 03:11:43.669]  We're good to go.
[03:11:43.689 --> 03:11:44.209]  I think?
[03:12:12.391 --> 03:12:14.793]  I don't want you to be fighting back and you can't breathe.
[03:12:29.568 --> 03:12:30.329]  We're good to go.
[03:12:50.447 --> 03:12:58.074]  I feel so good about this because your products are amazing, your telemedicine is amazing, your information is amazing, and it funds our operation.
[03:12:58.134 --> 03:13:00.136]  A total 360 win.
[03:13:01.217 --> 03:13:05.260]  We're at a historical point now, and God gave us compounds and things that protect us.
[03:13:05.340 --> 03:13:09.083]  We need to use them, and we need to support independent media.
[03:13:09.123 --> 03:13:10.164]  Two-minute closing comments.
[03:13:10.184 --> 03:13:10.605]  We've got a break.
[03:13:12.426 --> 03:13:20.632]  Listen, brothers and sisters, fellow Americans and the world, humanity, this battle that we're fighting is a battle for our survival.
[03:13:20.852 --> 03:13:25.736]  And I do believe that we are winning because we have managed somehow to keep them at bay.
[03:13:26.197 --> 03:13:29.899]  But when the devil starts getting desperate, they're going to do even more desperate stuff.
[03:13:30.360 --> 03:13:32.882]  One of the things you need to do is be part of the information war.
[03:13:33.682 --> 03:13:34.503]  We're good to go.
[03:13:34.523 --> 03:13:35.623]  We're good to go.
[03:14:00.374 --> 03:14:00.915]  We're good to go.
[03:14:24.711 --> 03:14:32.656]  So if you go on our website, drstellarmp.com, you click on the Better Ranch tab, you can actually register and come for one of our conferences.
[03:14:32.736 --> 03:14:33.257]  It is free.
[03:14:33.737 --> 03:14:34.938]  Staying on the ranch is free.
[03:14:35.238 --> 03:14:41.602]  When we do all this stuff and the money we make and everything, we use it to take care of people and make sure that we can take care of you for free.
[03:14:41.722 --> 03:14:42.783]  So you can come and stay there.
[03:14:42.803 --> 03:14:47.946]  People can stay for a week, sometimes three days, four days during our programs, and it's free for you to stay.
[03:14:47.986 --> 03:14:49.307]  So come and get delivered.
[03:14:49.367 --> 03:14:50.388]  Come and get prayed for.
[03:14:50.988 --> 03:14:53.129]  And join us on our prayer programs.
[03:14:53.609 --> 03:14:58.450]  Join us on Twitter when we pray for the nation, pray for the president, and pray for our survival.
[03:14:58.570 --> 03:14:59.171]  Absolutely.
[03:14:59.291 --> 03:14:59.591]  All right.
[03:14:59.731 --> 03:15:03.592]  I've got major behind-the-scenes breaking news and so much massive stuff.
[03:15:03.712 --> 03:15:06.793]  Watch him, fullwars.com and newswars.com.
[03:15:06.873 --> 03:15:08.373]  It links to it in Bandai video.
[03:15:08.874 --> 03:15:11.614]  As this all unfolds, the War of the Mill Destroyer, 3 p.m.
[03:15:12.075 --> 03:15:12.575]  today.
[03:15:12.595 --> 03:15:16.096]  I'm going to probably be back today, but I've got so much stuff behind the scenes.
[03:15:16.156 --> 03:15:17.696]  Dr. Stella Emanuel, incredible job.
[03:15:17.756 --> 03:15:18.757]  DrStellaMD.com.
[03:15:18.817 --> 03:15:18.957]  Yes.
[03:15:20.157 --> 03:15:21.218]  Use promo code Alex.

[03:15:52.287 --> 03:15:52.588]  Today.
[03:15:57.216 --> 03:16:02.521]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing, high-quality coffee has not been available.
[03:16:02.981 --> 03:16:07.345]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[03:16:07.805 --> 03:16:10.288]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[03:16:10.848 --> 03:16:20.216]  But now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.
[03:16:20.416 --> 03:16:22.999]  It's powered by the company Minute Man Coffee.
[03:16:23.659 --> 03:16:31.684]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best-tasting, best-smelling, strongest coffee that I have ever drank.
[03:16:32.164 --> 03:16:33.565]  It is game-changing.
[03:16:34.025 --> 03:16:36.206]  All you've got to do is buy a bag of it and try it.

[03:16:58.803 --> 03:17:00.064]  Gunther in Tennessee.
[03:17:00.104 --> 03:17:01.145]  Thanks for calling, Gunther.
[03:17:01.285 --> 03:17:01.645]  Hey, Alex.
[03:17:01.825 --> 03:17:02.586]  First time caller.
[03:17:02.666 --> 03:17:04.527]  Real quick, wanted to plug your foundational energy.
[03:17:05.067 --> 03:17:06.028]  Just started taking that.
[03:17:06.688 --> 03:17:11.011]  And, boy, three pills, recommended dose, I was bouncing off the walls.
[03:17:11.132 --> 03:17:16.735]  But I tell you, foundational is the right name for that product because I'll cut down to one.
[03:17:17.356 --> 03:17:21.599]  It's like you have a baseline of energy that you were missing before that you got back.
[03:17:21.619 --> 03:17:21.759]  Okay.
[03:17:22.039 --> 03:17:30.261]  Well, I'm glad you mentioned that because it's methylfolate, the breakdown of folic acid, and a lot of people, particularly Europeans, don't absorb all of the folic acid.
[03:17:30.521 --> 03:17:31.602]  So it's not a stimulant.
[03:17:31.822 --> 03:17:35.243]  It's a totally natural thing that boosts energy that's foundational.
[03:17:35.523 --> 03:17:38.084]  And was I lying to you or did it not work?
[03:17:38.764 --> 03:17:39.984]  No, it was top-notch.
[03:17:40.004 --> 03:17:43.645]  And I was actually taking Red Pill Plus before, and that's got a little folic acid in it.
[03:17:43.685 --> 03:17:47.486]  I think there was a little buildup from this, but the energy from this was no jitters.
[03:17:47.646 --> 03:17:48.727]  I mean, it's top-notch.
[03:17:48.747 --> 03:17:49.387]  It's a great product.
[03:17:49.807 --> 03:17:50.768]  Well, thank you so much.
[03:17:50.828 --> 03:17:54.571]  Yeah, no, folic acid's great and it's in real red pill, but some can't break it down.
[03:17:54.611 --> 03:17:55.631]  This is the breakdown of it.
[03:17:55.691 --> 03:17:56.452]  That's exactly it.
[03:17:57.052 --> 03:17:59.314]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[03:17:59.514 --> 03:17:59.854]  Thank you.
[03:18:00.055 --> 03:18:02.596]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[03:18:02.676 --> 03:18:03.917]  I started taking that stuff.
[03:18:03.977 --> 03:18:07.160]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[03:18:07.280 --> 03:18:08.181]  When did you start taking it?
[03:18:08.461 --> 03:18:12.444]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[03:18:12.544 --> 03:18:12.784]  Mm-hmm.
[03:18:13.064 --> 03:18:15.766]  And I started eating a little better, but my blood pressure stayed high.
[03:18:15.786 --> 03:18:23.313]  And when I took the X2 iodine after about two or four weeks, I think my body was detoxified of a bunch of metals and stuff that my body was storing.
[03:18:23.413 --> 03:18:25.615]  And my blood pressure came down to the perfect level.
[03:18:26.015 --> 03:18:28.938]  And I tell people the only thing I did was X2 iodine.
[03:18:29.398 --> 03:18:29.618]  I'm good.
[03:18:57.602 --> 03:18:59.804]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalist.
[03:19:00.184 --> 03:19:02.527]  And people can't identify who's a patriot and who isn't.
[03:19:02.847 --> 03:19:06.010]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalist.
[03:19:06.050 --> 03:19:08.973]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.
[03:19:09.213 --> 03:19:19.803]  That's why I designed this amazing 1776 red, white, and blue Gadsden flag shirt so you can support the Infowar and meet like-minded people everywhere when you wear it.
[03:19:19.923 --> 03:19:25.529]  When you wear these shirts, it creates an amazing amount of energy and it's quite the adventure.

[03:19:49.963 --> 03:19:55.784]  Spread the word, meet like-minded people, and fund the 1776 revolution worldwide.
[03:19:58.045 --> 03:20:03.926]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:14.753 --> 03:20:19.843]  We're here with the world's most dangerous man, the most censored man in the English language.
[03:20:20.604 --> 03:20:24.992]  But honestly, when you get him in front of an outhouse in the woods, he doesn't seem so dangerous.
[03:20:25.894 --> 03:20:26.776]  It's a fancy outhouse.
[03:20:29.147 --> 03:20:33.170]  We have a ruling class in the United States defined by its hatreds.
[03:20:33.831 --> 03:20:38.014]  Not its loves, not its hopes, but by its hatreds.
[03:20:38.134 --> 03:20:47.741]  They hate all kinds of people, large groups of people, the deplorables, the bitter clingers, America's entire blue-collar population, the unfashionable people.
[03:20:48.242 --> 03:20:48.642]  They're hated.
[03:20:49.488 --> 03:20:50.628]  By the people who run our country.
[03:20:51.268 --> 03:20:55.629]  But no one is hated more by them than a man called Alex Jones.
[03:20:56.230 --> 03:21:01.111]  Alex Jones is the single most censored man in all American history.
[03:21:01.611 --> 03:21:06.412]  He was the first media figure in our history to be completely erased and one day deplatformed.
[03:21:06.532 --> 03:21:09.773]  Alex Jones was deplatformed before it was a common term.
[03:21:10.593 --> 03:21:11.933]  And not just deplatformed.
[03:21:12.573 --> 03:21:12.954]  Sued.
[03:21:14.054 --> 03:21:14.574]  Attacked.
[03:21:15.194 --> 03:21:16.974]  They attempted to criminally charge him.
[03:21:17.755 --> 03:21:19.135]  What did Alex Jones do wrong?
[03:21:20.023 --> 03:21:21.624]  Alex Jones didn't rape anybody.
[03:21:22.385 --> 03:21:23.545]  He didn't loot Macy's.
[03:21:23.966 --> 03:21:25.627]  He didn't burn a police station.
[03:21:26.127 --> 03:21:29.710]  He didn't invent a fake cryptocurrency and loot pension funds.
[03:21:29.730 --> 03:21:33.933]  He didn't start a pointless war that made this country poorer and more disorganized.
[03:21:33.953 --> 03:21:35.354]  He didn't open the southern border.
[03:21:35.434 --> 03:21:41.258]  No, Alex Jones had opinions that deeply rattled the people who run America.
[03:21:41.358 --> 03:21:42.659]  In fact, rattled a lot of us.
[03:21:42.739 --> 03:21:45.841]  And I'll just confess that I first heard of Alex Jones
[03:21:47.119 --> 03:21:52.440]  When he questioned the official story behind 9-11, and I, speaking for myself, was deeply offended by this.
[03:21:53.500 --> 03:22:07.844]  I didn't take any time to find out what he was saying, but I was bothered by the idea that this defining event in American history, which changed the life of everyone who lived here then, might not actually have unfolded as we were told it did.
[03:22:08.164 --> 03:22:10.344]  And that possibility was too destabilizing.
[03:22:10.364 --> 03:22:13.265]  And I remember feeling resentment toward Alex Jones for saying that.
[03:22:14.225 --> 03:22:20.927]  But several years later, I went up in Austin, Texas, and through a chain of circumstances wound up meeting Alex Jones.
[03:22:21.728 --> 03:22:27.410]  And I learned what everyone who has met him now knows, which is Alex Jones is not a crazy person.
[03:22:27.850 --> 03:22:30.911]  Alex Jones has said pretty far out things on TV from time to time.
[03:22:31.764 --> 03:22:32.784]  Not that far out.
[03:22:32.965 --> 03:22:36.306]  He hasn't said men can become women or Ukraine is a democracy.
[03:22:36.846 --> 03:22:39.647]  But within the bounds of, say, cable news, pretty far out.
[03:22:40.488 --> 03:22:44.109]  But fundamentally, Alex Jones is right about a lot of things.
[03:22:44.309 --> 03:22:46.070]  And in fact, that's why they don't like him.
[03:22:46.910 --> 03:22:52.533]  Alex Jones has an uncanny, really an amazing ability to predict events before they happen.
[03:22:52.633 --> 03:22:57.054]  He has called it and he's done it on tape again and again to the point where it's a meme on the Internet.
[03:22:57.535 --> 03:22:58.735]  Alex Jones, profit.
[03:22:58.995 --> 03:23:00.616]  Not conspiracy nut, profit.
[03:23:01.533 --> 03:23:01.873]  Alex Jones Show!
[03:23:30.290 --> 03:23:34.091]  And so we thought it would be interesting to sit down and talk to Alex Jones, the man.
[03:23:34.531 --> 03:23:35.812]  He joins us now in our studio.
[03:23:36.312 --> 03:23:37.012]  Alex Jones, thank you.
[03:23:37.352 --> 03:23:38.852]  Wow, Tucker, it's great to be here.
[03:23:38.993 --> 03:23:42.113]  Amazing studios, amazing people.
[03:23:42.674 --> 03:23:45.734]  And this is really going to be, I think, a historic interview.
[03:23:45.755 --> 03:23:46.695]  So thanks for having me.
[03:23:46.735 --> 03:23:48.915]  Well, I'm really grateful to be able to do it.
[03:23:48.955 --> 03:23:53.997]  And it's one of the great blessings of my life and of my job is that I've been able to meet people
[03:23:54.977 --> 03:24:04.803]  That I've had preconceptions about, and sometimes find those preconceptions bolstered, and in other cases demolished, and you're definitely in the second category.
[03:24:04.823 --> 03:24:11.467]  So I want, for people who have made it this far, the people who are in the country have really succeeded in making you disreputable.
[03:24:12.259 --> 03:24:14.241]  And the whole point, of course, is people won't listen to you.
[03:24:14.842 --> 03:24:24.370]  So we thought it'd be interesting to start with a series of on-tape predictions that you made, some of which are so precise and so prescient that it makes the hair on my arms stand up.
[03:24:25.131 --> 03:24:28.114]  And I'm being sincere, and our viewers are about to see what I'm talking about.
[03:24:28.254 --> 03:24:31.077]  Here is a list of things that you called ahead of time.
[03:24:31.960 --> 03:24:40.305]  By the middle of September, with the new policies being written, you all have to wear masks again, and so will airport employees.
[03:24:40.846 --> 03:24:41.646]  It's happening.
[03:24:41.686 --> 03:24:43.968]  Mask mandates are officially back.
[03:24:44.088 --> 03:24:51.572]  We know the Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted to blow up airliners, Baltimore Sun, or if you let some terrorist group do it, like the World Trade Center, we know who to blame.
[03:24:51.592 --> 03:25:00.158]  And if there was an outside threat like a bin Laden, who was a known CIA asset in the 80s, this group and its leader, a person named Osama bin Laden, he's the boogeyman they need.
[03:25:00.478 --> 03:25:03.179]  We're looking at a giant war in February right now.
[03:25:03.219 --> 03:25:05.160]  I predict the Russians are going to roll in.
[03:25:05.480 --> 03:25:06.100]  They're already there.
[03:25:06.120 --> 03:25:06.800]  They're going to roll in.
[03:25:07.360 --> 03:25:10.662]  With attacks across Ukraine, which is the size of Texas.
[03:25:10.902 --> 03:25:12.302]  It really was the Iraqis.
[03:25:12.322 --> 03:25:14.083]  That's just because they're getting ready to invade Iraq.
[03:25:14.523 --> 03:25:15.663]  What a beautiful setup.
[03:25:16.544 --> 03:25:18.064]  Those 9-11 clips are crazy.
[03:25:18.504 --> 03:25:21.245]  I'm actually bothered by the precision of them.
[03:25:21.265 --> 03:25:22.866]  I'm not accusing you of being behind 9-11.
[03:25:23.246 --> 03:25:25.827]  But how could you, in July of 2001...
[03:25:28.877 --> 03:25:29.377]  Call that.
[03:25:29.778 --> 03:25:37.623]  You said they're going to have airliners fly into the World Trade Center and they're going to blame a guy called Osama bin Laden.
[03:25:37.903 --> 03:25:41.646]  Leaving aside what actually happened, how could you have known that?
[03:25:42.326 --> 03:25:45.588]  Well, in the longer clips, it's a multi-hour show from July 25th to 26th.
[03:25:48.546 --> 03:25:57.850]  2001.
[03:25:49.787 --> 03:25:57.850]  I specifically walked through all the reasons and I knew that they were hyping up that we were about to be hit by Osama bin Laden.
[03:25:57.890 --> 03:26:04.693]  I knew that the World Trade Center had been attacked the first time and that the feds had been involved helping cook the bomb and allowing it to go forward.
[03:26:05.133 --> 03:26:09.155]  And I just saw a lot of the pre-programming that was happening in the media
[03:26:10.195 --> 03:26:13.318]  They were on the news saying, you know, life's about to change in America.
[03:26:13.718 --> 03:26:16.881]  And I was reading what the Rand Corporation was saying and what the Pentagon was putting out.
[03:26:17.381 --> 03:26:23.406]  I read the PNAC document from a year before, Rebuilding America's Defenses, that Dick Cheney had helped write.
[03:26:23.906 --> 03:26:33.894]  And it said we need a Pearl Harbor event on the American homeland to be able to bring in this police state and this control and expand the American empire worldwide.
[03:26:33.954 --> 03:26:37.097]  So hundreds of pieces of data went into that prediction.
[03:26:39.881 --> 03:26:42.723]  But terrorists are going to hit the World Trade Center in July of 2001.
[03:26:43.363 --> 03:26:45.084]  I lived in the United States then.
[03:26:45.284 --> 03:26:47.185]  That was the last thing on my mind.
[03:26:47.806 --> 03:26:48.786]  And I lived in Washington.
[03:26:48.826 --> 03:26:51.728]  I know the guys who wrote the PNAC document because I shared an office with them.
[03:26:51.768 --> 03:26:54.070]  So I was more informed than the average person.
[03:26:54.710 --> 03:26:58.833]  And that was the last thing that crossed my mind in the summer of 2001.
[03:26:59.813 --> 03:27:01.194]  Like everyone else, I thought it was a Cessna.
[03:27:01.794 --> 03:27:04.276]  But how convinced were you that this was going to happen?
[03:27:05.433 --> 03:27:06.394]  I was completely convinced.
[03:27:06.414 --> 03:27:10.759]  In fact, in the full clip that's online, you can find it on Twitter and other places, it has been removed.
[03:27:11.419 --> 03:27:22.031]  I explained to people that they need to call the White House and tell the White House, we know if you allow these attacks that you're basically allowing it to happen.
[03:27:22.651 --> 03:27:24.273]  And it was similar to all the data we had.
[03:27:24.673 --> 03:27:26.275]  You said that on your show?
[03:27:26.635 --> 03:27:26.956]  On my show.
[03:27:27.782 --> 03:27:30.503]  And I gave the number out so people could actually call the White House.
[03:27:30.943 --> 03:27:40.325]  And then going back to October of last year, when the Russians went into Ukraine, I specifically said I think they'll go in by the end of February.
[03:27:41.025 --> 03:27:42.686]  And there was a lot of data that went into that.
[03:27:43.226 --> 03:27:46.347]  And then they specifically did go in on February 24th.
[03:27:46.387 --> 03:27:48.887]  And so I was able to make that prediction as well.
[03:27:48.907 --> 03:27:52.028]  But there was a lot of data and information that went into it.
[03:27:52.148 --> 03:27:52.388]  Sure.
[03:27:52.888 --> 03:27:54.689]  I'm just, for the record, I miscalled that completely.
[03:27:54.749 --> 03:27:55.869]  I didn't think they were going to do it.
[03:27:56.189 --> 03:27:56.589]  You were right.
[03:27:56.669 --> 03:27:57.889]  I was wrong, not for the first time.
[03:27:58.509 --> 03:28:01.330]  But the 9-11 thing, I remember that really well.
[03:28:01.510 --> 03:28:03.290]  Nobody was thinking like that.
[03:28:03.850 --> 03:28:06.431]  So you called it in public, on tape.
[03:28:06.491 --> 03:28:10.852]  Did the 9-11 Commission... So if I'm the FBI and I'm investigating 9-11, you're like the first guy I would call.
[03:28:10.872 --> 03:28:12.932]  Because you're the only person who said that out loud.
[03:28:13.252 --> 03:28:13.813]  Did they call you?
[03:28:14.813 --> 03:28:15.293]  No, they didn't.
[03:28:15.613 --> 03:28:15.733]  But...
[03:28:17.026 --> 03:28:39.727]  My most accurate prediction, going back over a decade, was when I read the Rockefeller Foundation Operation Lockstep, and they described using a virus to bring in world government, to bring in a world medical ID, that they would then build a social credit score off of, and that they would make people wear masks for fear, that they would shut down sporting events and things like that, and basically phase in this new tyranny.
[03:28:39.967 --> 03:28:41.549]  So I was also able to specifically...
[03:28:42.870 --> 03:28:43.270]  Winter is coming.
[03:28:43.290 --> 03:28:43.630]  Winter is coming.
[03:28:43.650 --> 03:28:44.270]  Winter is coming.
[03:28:44.290 --> 03:28:44.831]  Winter is coming.
[03:29:04.457 --> 03:29:05.977]  Winter is coming.
[03:29:06.278 --> 03:29:07.678]  Winter isn't coming.
[03:29:08.258 --> 03:29:09.539]  Winter is here.

[03:29:56.960 --> 03:30:00.482]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[03:30:00.862 --> 03:30:07.885]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[03:30:08.065 --> 03:30:10.066]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[03:30:10.246 --> 03:30:11.307]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[03:30:11.327 --> 03:30:12.047]  He loved the idea.
[03:30:12.367 --> 03:30:15.891]  What would you call the debate and discussion about a pro-human future?
[03:30:15.911 --> 03:30:16.792]  Just Team Humanity?
[03:30:16.852 --> 03:30:17.753]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[03:30:17.893 --> 03:30:18.354]  Absolutely.

[03:30:46.111 --> 03:30:50.372]  We're told all this garbage so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[03:30:50.693 --> 03:30:51.393]  We're not going to do that.

[03:32:58.368 --> 03:33:04.273]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:13.388 --> 03:33:21.033]  Go watch their hour-long, two-hour-long, three-hour-long meetings they have on YouTube with all the tops.
[03:33:21.093 --> 03:33:23.134]  I mean, we're talking hundreds of top scientists.
[03:33:23.795 --> 03:33:34.822]  They admit that they're building a post-human world, that soon everyone's going to be mind-controlled, that they're going to put smart dust in our food that they can electromagnetically control.
[03:33:35.522 --> 03:33:37.564]  And they just lay it all out right there.
[03:33:38.045 --> 03:33:41.468]  And I've learned what these people said in the 50s they would do were done by the 70s.
[03:33:41.848 --> 03:33:45.832]  What they said their plan was in the 70s for the 90s, they got done.
[03:33:46.373 --> 03:33:55.381]  And then when they had their Agenda 21 in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the big UN summit, they described everything they would do up until the year 2000, and they got almost all of that done.
[03:33:55.942 --> 03:33:56.682]  Now they've got Agenda 2030 done,
[03:33:57.970 --> 03:33:59.472]  And we're going to ban your gas stoves.
[03:33:59.492 --> 03:34:00.514]  We're going to ban beef.
[03:34:00.894 --> 03:34:02.557]  We're going to ban single-family dwellings.
[03:34:03.037 --> 03:34:04.840]  We're going to ban private ownership of cars.
[03:34:05.481 --> 03:34:08.124]  We're going to do all this, and now you see them rolling it all out.
[03:34:08.144 --> 03:34:14.654]  So I'm not really making predictions in these high-level World Economic Forum and other large think tanks.
[03:34:15.174 --> 03:34:15.374]  I think?
[03:34:36.516 --> 03:34:37.356]  We're good to go.
[03:34:57.725 --> 03:35:00.667]  Where they describe, we really need big terror attacks.
[03:35:01.047 --> 03:35:04.348]  We really need Pearl Harbor events to get Americans to give up their rights.
[03:35:05.009 --> 03:35:06.389]  I mean, take what just happened in Israel.
[03:35:06.429 --> 03:35:07.110]  Totally tragic.
[03:35:07.130 --> 03:35:10.651]  My heart goes out to all that have been killed or lost levels or been injured.
[03:35:11.472 --> 03:35:11.632]  But...
[03:35:12.668 --> 03:35:17.371]  There's no way that one of the best intelligence agencies in the world didn't know that was coming.
[03:35:17.411 --> 03:35:23.595]  The massive buildup, the 5,000 missiles, the paragliding attacks, all of that.
[03:35:24.155 --> 03:35:26.276]  And so there was clearly a stand down there.
[03:35:27.097 --> 03:35:29.238]  And now the West will take more of the people's rights.
[03:35:29.398 --> 03:35:34.742]  Israel will be able to crack down and take more of their people's rights, which is a big debate over there.
[03:35:36.485 --> 03:35:39.111]  Hamas is being funded by Hezbollah, which is Iran.
[03:35:39.592 --> 03:35:43.080]  We just had Biden a month ago give $6 billion to Iran.
[03:35:44.830 --> 03:35:49.472]  And now the mullahs are bragging that they were behind the attack, Hezbollah funding Hamas.
[03:35:50.012 --> 03:35:51.853]  So really, those aren't even predictions.
[03:35:52.473 --> 03:36:05.759]  It's clear that Hezbollah and Hamas have tens of thousands of men and women as sleeper cells that are, quote, other than Mexican that the Border Patrol lists every month, tens of thousands coming across the Texas and Arizona and California sectors.
[03:36:06.439 --> 03:36:10.061]  And it's an easy equation to predict that there's a wide probability
[03:36:10.801 --> 03:36:24.104]  That Hezbollah and Hamas at some point are going to attack sports stadiums, they're going to attack colleges, they're going to attack synagogues, they're going to shoot up mass gatherings if they're given the order by Iran, if we go to war with Iran.
[03:36:24.544 --> 03:36:29.846]  And then when this happens, our government won't get in trouble for dissolving the border and letting these people come in.
[03:36:30.246 --> 03:36:33.146]  Just like on 9-11, our government clearly had prior knowledge.
[03:36:33.166 --> 03:36:35.047]  There was clearly a major standout that went on.
[03:36:35.727 --> 03:36:45.835]  And the government got more power, more control, and now they're not pointing the homeland security apparatus at the Russians like they did in the Cold War or the Islamists after 9-11.
[03:36:46.876 --> 03:36:55.602]  Now they admit that their main focus is Christian conservatives and the bitter clingers and the people that live in rural America that quote white people.
[03:36:55.742 --> 03:36:58.785]  I mean, it says that in the report, are the main terror threat.
[03:36:59.245 --> 03:37:02.528]  And so this whole apparatus of the war on terror...
[03:37:03.468 --> 03:37:13.231]  It has now been turned inwardly against the people, not just here, but also in Europe, where if someone criticizes transgenderism in the UK, they come to their house and arrest them.
[03:37:14.171 --> 03:37:16.572]  If a journalist does that, they come to their house and arrest them.
[03:37:17.112 --> 03:37:22.894]  If somebody says, I think these surveillance cameras should start getting cut down, they come to their house and they arrest them for their free speech.
[03:37:22.954 --> 03:37:30.996]  And so this is a global movement by the megacorporations, by the Black Rocks and the state streets and the vanguards that control 80-plus percent of world wealth
[03:37:31.716 --> 03:37:32.476]  To control our behavior.
[03:37:32.496 --> 03:37:34.917]  And Larry Fink of BlackRock has said that.
[03:37:35.197 --> 03:37:42.740]  We're going to use our control over all this finance and this global social credit score we're rolling out to control people's behavior.
[03:37:43.120 --> 03:37:44.841]  So that's really what this is.
[03:37:44.881 --> 03:37:47.542]  And then they use the threat of global warming.
[03:37:47.582 --> 03:37:49.022]  They use the threat of a virus.
[03:37:49.062 --> 03:37:52.543]  They use the threat of radical Islam to take our rights.
[03:37:52.623 --> 03:37:54.004]  But we really are the target.
[03:37:55.399 --> 03:37:58.682]  Even if I... By the way, none of that seems implausible at this point.
[03:37:58.722 --> 03:38:00.803]  I mean, just you're a measure of how the world has changed.
[03:38:00.843 --> 03:38:06.228]  If you'd said this to me 15 years ago, I'd have been like, you know, someone's a crackpot and it's not me.
[03:38:06.888 --> 03:38:09.871]  And now after COVID, nothing you said seems crazy at all.
[03:38:09.891 --> 03:38:13.293]  I mean, you may be right, you may be wrong, but it's not out of the realm of possibility, obviously.
[03:38:14.514 --> 03:38:17.397]  But even if I disagree with what you just said, I would think that's pretty interesting.
[03:38:17.437 --> 03:38:18.538]  It's an interesting perspective.
[03:38:19.458 --> 03:38:21.640]  Why do you think... You've committed no crime.
[03:38:21.660 --> 03:38:22.521]  You'd be in jail if you had.
[03:38:23.482 --> 03:38:25.383]  Why do you think they hate you so much?
[03:38:27.883 --> 03:38:45.389]  Because I do read their documents and I do read their books and we were effectively getting a lot of people in the military and the intelligence agencies who were compartmentalized and who tuned into my show and saw my films and read my books and things and they clicked with it
[03:38:46.249 --> 03:38:49.651]  And said, wow, I see all this going on around me.
[03:38:49.691 --> 03:38:50.632]  He's not lying about it.
[03:38:51.172 --> 03:38:54.234]  And then I would give them other pieces that I discovered or my other guests discovered.
[03:38:54.474 --> 03:38:59.157]  And so it was giving them an operational awareness outside of their compartmentalization.
[03:38:59.797 --> 03:39:07.822]  And so we had massive success in the military, in the police, and in the intelligence agencies, not just here, but around the world.
[03:39:08.943 --> 03:39:12.065]  And so our penetration into those areas to...
[03:39:14.911 --> 03:39:24.099]  Help people expand their awareness that we're inside the government, inside corporations, was triggering a lot of whistleblowers, was triggering a lot of people not going along with the program.
[03:39:24.720 --> 03:39:27.722]  And so really my sin was decompartmentalization of the population.
[03:39:29.784 --> 03:39:35.929]  When you got deplatformed, to this day no one has ever been more aggressively censored, I don't think, than you.
[03:39:36.590 --> 03:39:38.692]  I've apologized to you this in person before.
[03:39:38.772 --> 03:39:41.114]  I was in Labrador on a fishing trip and missed the entire thing.
[03:39:41.889 --> 03:39:42.411]  We're good to go.
[03:39:50.865 --> 03:39:53.386]  I don't think anybody defended you when that happened.
[03:39:53.606 --> 03:39:53.966]  Anybody.
[03:39:54.646 --> 03:39:56.447]  With any kind of audience.
[03:39:56.467 --> 03:40:08.491]  When Tim Cook admitted that he met on the weekend in August of 2017 with the other big tech heads, and they made the decision to curate, like it's a museum, and take me off, it was hundreds of platforms.
[03:40:08.511 --> 03:40:10.272]  I mean, it wasn't just all the big ones.
[03:40:10.352 --> 03:40:16.234]  It was everything from LinkedIn to our bank accounts being taken away to everything ensuing that week and over the next month.
[03:40:17.254 --> 03:40:24.502]  And I knew that I was a test case, and I wasn't taken off those platforms for any demonstrable reason.
[03:40:25.022 --> 03:40:28.506]  It was the questioning the school shooting thing that came later.
[03:40:28.886 --> 03:40:36.614]  They went and kind of dredged that up for my past, just questioning it a few times, blew that up after I'd been deplatformed, and said I was deplatformed for that.
[03:40:36.694 --> 03:40:38.515]  If you check the record, I wasn't.
[03:40:39.766 --> 03:40:47.312]  And so once they deplatformed me, it made the show in ways only get bigger with people actually going to Infowars.com and finding me on local radio stations and things.
[03:40:47.712 --> 03:40:52.976]  So then they panicked and said, okay, let's look at his record and create more of a reason that he's being taken off.
[03:40:53.236 --> 03:41:04.164]  So they took things out of context from five, six years before, blew them up as a current thing out of context, and deceptively reported on what I'd said to create a straw man argument to then facilitate the reason why.
[03:41:04.384 --> 03:41:14.930]  What's so crazy is if you asked just a cross-section of Americans who's responsible for the Sandy Hook massacre of kids at the school, no one remembers the name of the murderer.
[03:41:15.191 --> 03:41:15.731]  Adam Lanza.
[03:41:16.091 --> 03:41:16.732]  Okay, thank you.
[03:41:17.332 --> 03:41:17.952]  I didn't remember.
[03:41:17.972 --> 03:41:18.873]  Alex Jones.
[03:41:19.967 --> 03:41:23.089]  They effectively blamed you for a school shooting that you were not present at.
[03:41:23.289 --> 03:41:24.871]  I have people come up to me in the parking lot.
[03:41:25.111 --> 03:41:26.232]  You can ask my security guy.
[03:41:26.492 --> 03:41:29.354]  He's been there when people walk up and go, why'd you kill those kids?
[03:41:29.934 --> 03:41:31.195]  And then you go, I didn't kill those kids.
[03:41:31.255 --> 03:41:32.856]  And they go, yeah, you did.
[03:41:33.257 --> 03:41:35.678]  And so that is what this has turned into.
[03:41:35.738 --> 03:41:36.599]  And this is bigger than me.
[03:41:36.619 --> 03:41:44.705]  I want people to understand something, that the mullahs in Iran and the Ayatollah are congratulating Hamas.
[03:41:46.161 --> 03:41:52.945]  That just killed around a thousand or more innocent Israelis, many of them women, children, disabled people, in a vicious, evil sneak attack.
[03:41:53.546 --> 03:41:54.326]  They are on there.
[03:41:54.386 --> 03:42:06.414]  Hezbollah and Hamas, mainly Hamas, but it's Hezbollah funding it out of Iran, are literally posting videos of them cutting people's heads off and killing children and massacring innocent people.
[03:42:06.874 --> 03:42:10.957]  They're allowed to have their Hezbollah accounts and their Hamas accounts.
[03:42:11.978 --> 03:42:13.919]  The Ayatollah is able to congratulate them
[03:42:14.969 --> 03:42:17.770]  But these people have done, and I am still banned.
[03:42:17.790 --> 03:42:18.791]  And I'm not mad at Elon Musk.
[03:42:18.811 --> 03:42:21.172]  I understand I've been so demonized with the general public.
[03:42:21.212 --> 03:42:24.113]  He's barely able to keep Twitter going right now.
[03:42:24.253 --> 03:42:25.334]  I really appreciate what he's done.
[03:42:25.354 --> 03:42:26.014]  I admire him.
[03:42:26.034 --> 03:42:27.455]  I think he's done a lot of great work.
[03:42:28.015 --> 03:42:29.416]  And I see him moving in the right direction.
[03:42:29.436 --> 03:42:31.417]  So a lot of people attack Musk on Twitter.
[03:42:32.337 --> 03:42:36.879]  I trend all the time, hey, if you're such an absolutist on free speech, bring back Alex Jones.
[03:42:38.490 --> 03:42:43.613]  I understand that if he did that, the ADL and others would really be able to probably shut down Twitter.
[03:42:43.653 --> 03:42:48.355]  So I understand that he needs to go through a process before he does that.
[03:42:48.615 --> 03:42:51.096]  So people get mad at Twitter for not... Why the ADL?
[03:42:51.276 --> 03:42:57.479]  I don't... I mean, I'm not the world's expert on your career, but I know you.
[03:42:57.619 --> 03:43:00.801]  I've never heard you say a single anti-Semitic thing and an anti-Israel thing.
[03:43:01.613 --> 03:43:03.234]  Why would the ADL be against you?
[03:43:03.274 --> 03:43:07.358]  I don't think anyone's even called you an anti-Semite.
[03:43:07.558 --> 03:43:08.538]  Unless I'm missing something.
[03:43:09.399 --> 03:43:17.626]  What goes on is the left forever called everybody a racist if you were just a conservative or pro-Second Amendment or pro-life or thought we ought to have a border.
[03:43:18.987 --> 03:43:21.709]  And that didn't work anymore to call people racist.
[03:43:22.369 --> 03:43:25.592]  And so the ADL gets all this big liberal donations.
[03:43:26.392 --> 03:43:26.793]  And so...
[03:43:28.311 --> 03:43:35.698]  They go out and then police and take people's sponsors and target them just by the ADL calling up sponsors.
[03:43:35.778 --> 03:43:36.939]  Sponsors get scared and drop.
[03:43:37.319 --> 03:43:38.740]  That's what they've done to Elon Musk.
[03:43:39.962 --> 03:43:44.386]  They took over 50% of Twitter's North American and European advertising
[03:43:44.966 --> 03:43:45.426]  We're good to go.
[03:43:45.446 --> 03:43:45.586]  I think?
[03:44:09.221 --> 03:44:15.367]  Whatever happened to the ACLU that used to support the KKK marching through a town or publishing their own newspaper?
[03:44:15.408 --> 03:44:16.288]  I don't support the KKK.
[03:44:16.349 --> 03:44:16.969]  I think they're a joke.
[03:44:17.350 --> 03:44:19.712]  But if you take their rights, you take everybody's.
[03:44:19.932 --> 03:44:26.039]  But they're not even taking the rights of those people to post because they create fear and they get the ADL more funding.
[03:44:26.639 --> 03:44:34.887]  But if they can target an Alex Jones or an Elon Musk or a Tucker Carlson, then they're going after the real populist leaders that are bringing America together.
[03:44:35.167 --> 03:44:46.678]  And so what the left wants is to divide us all according to race and to come out and say fundamentally with critical race theory that inherently being white is bad and teaching five-year-old white children they're inherently bad because they're white.
[03:44:47.159 --> 03:44:50.682]  That is wounding their brains and really creating racial division.
[03:44:50.722 --> 03:44:51.743]  Why do people put up with that?
[03:44:52.842 --> 03:45:08.366]  I don't understand why... I mean, that's just... If you had told me 20 years ago, and I grew up in a world where judging people on the basis of their skin color was totally immoral, and I still believe that, but if you told me 20 years ago that we were going to live in a world where people get on TV and just be like, I hate white people, they're bad, no, it's totally fine.
[03:45:08.806 --> 03:45:11.286]  Like, why do people put up with that?
[03:45:11.506 --> 03:45:13.087]  Like, there should be zero tolerance for that.
[03:45:13.307 --> 03:45:13.847]  I don't get it.
[03:45:14.167 --> 03:45:18.708]  The Democratic Party founded the KKK, and when the majority were whites...
[03:45:19.830 --> 03:45:22.571]  In the South in some areas, they played the race card for political power.
[03:45:23.191 --> 03:45:33.554]  Now that the majority in most areas are not white, they're playing the good old-fashioned race card of tell whites, you know, stand down, let people take over your society, your culture, give up your culture.
[03:45:34.034 --> 03:45:35.434]  It's embarrassing to be white.
[03:45:35.874 --> 03:45:46.777]  And then now it's flat-out bad to be white, and the left's trying to convert all these minority groups that are now the majority in most areas into race-based systems because that is a very effective system.
[03:45:46.797 --> 03:45:47.698]  But why do people put up with that?
[03:45:47.718 --> 03:45:49.198]  I mean, like, if they were doing that to militants...
[03:45:49.258 --> 03:45:50.018]  I totally agree.
[03:45:50.078 --> 03:45:52.780]  The reason they've done it is most of the enforcers of this are white people.
[03:46:08.402 --> 03:46:10.503]  Liberal women, 45 or older.
[03:46:10.563 --> 03:46:10.883]  Fair!
[03:46:10.903 --> 03:46:11.763]  It's just a fact.
[03:46:12.384 --> 03:46:13.904]  And they're cucked husbands.
[03:46:14.805 --> 03:46:18.606]  And so to them... Can I say that the phrase cucked husbands is the best?
[03:46:19.647 --> 03:46:20.387]  It really is true.
[03:46:20.847 --> 03:46:24.629]  So if you get around these white liberals, they live in the whitest areas.
[03:46:25.169 --> 03:46:26.770]  They're totally scared of anybody with brown skin.
[03:46:27.310 --> 03:46:32.132]  But they virtue signal constantly and then say, yes, the white people are bad.
[03:46:32.632 --> 03:46:50.818]  You know, the white people are evil, and, you know, these... I mean, I've even seen white people sit there and say, yeah, it's time to deal with these crackers, and they're a white person saying that, so... From Jackson Hole, or Nantucket, or Aspen, or Bethesda, the whitest places in America.
[03:46:51.158 --> 03:46:52.279]  So shouldn't there be a law?
[03:46:52.299 --> 03:46:52.899]  Super simple.
[03:46:53.319 --> 03:46:58.321]  If you've got a BLM sign in your yard, you should be required to live in Gary, Indiana, or Baltimore.
[03:46:59.041 --> 03:47:02.422]  You should not be anywhere near Jackson, Wyoming.
[03:47:02.802 --> 03:47:04.402]  You should be made to live in East St.
[03:47:04.442 --> 03:47:04.722]  Louis.
[03:47:04.942 --> 03:47:05.543]  I totally agree.
[03:47:05.563 --> 03:47:07.443]  You should be made to live in Detroit.
[03:47:07.603 --> 03:47:08.643]  Yes.
[03:47:09.043 --> 03:47:11.384]  But, of course, they've done the studies, they've looked at the statistics.
[03:47:11.664 --> 03:47:14.865]  It's not just here, it's in Europe, and it's in the UK, like in London.
[03:47:15.465 --> 03:47:17.685]  The liberal areas are like 99% white.
[03:47:18.025 --> 03:47:19.046]  Oh, I noticed.
[03:47:19.126 --> 03:47:23.007]  Okay, and there's a lot of rich people in London that aren't white, but they're not even in that area.
[03:47:23.447 --> 03:47:24.147]  They are the most...
[03:47:25.060 --> 03:47:41.698]  Insular group, and then they point at white Christian culture and society that actually outlawed slavery in most of the world, was the vanguard of stopping it, and then they don't point at China, which is the most homogeneous, racist group in the world.
[03:47:41.718 --> 03:47:42.579]  It's an ethnostate.
[03:47:42.679 --> 03:47:43.780]  It's Han Chinese, period.
[03:47:44.301 --> 03:47:48.264]  Well, they teach, as you know on their news, that we are going to have Chinese superiority.
[03:47:48.544 --> 03:47:49.925]  We are the Chinese supremacist.
[03:47:50.685 --> 03:47:52.046]  Xi Jinping admires Hitler.
[03:47:53.047 --> 03:47:58.350]  He is literally following a race-based operation that is taking the world over, that owns the majority.
[03:47:59.494 --> 03:48:01.015]  That's paid off the Democratic Party.
[03:48:01.415 --> 03:48:12.599]  And if you look at all these anti-white shows that you see funded in Hollywood, almost all of it has majority literal communist Chinese government backing that is funding this.
[03:48:12.619 --> 03:48:13.179]  So it's real simple.
[03:48:13.439 --> 03:48:19.902]  China looks in and sees this diverse culture, and they say, we're going to use that to split the country up and balkanize it.
[03:48:20.262 --> 03:48:20.942]  And that's what they've done.
[03:48:21.262 --> 03:48:22.423]  And so communist China
[03:48:23.203 --> 03:48:23.643]  We're good to go.
[03:48:41.055 --> 03:48:53.724]  Then they organize all these other groups into race-based groups to then unify them under the Democratic Party to attack who is left that tends to be more conservative, and that is some white people in this country.
[03:48:53.984 --> 03:48:58.928]  Though they're panicking because more and more blacks are voting Republican, more and more Hispanics are voting Republican.
[03:48:58.948 --> 03:49:00.149]  They're starting to figure this out.
[03:49:00.529 --> 03:49:07.494]  So now they're in panic mode to bring in totally disenfranchised third-world populations who are refugees from the multi-year lockdowns
[03:49:07.914 --> 03:49:10.976]  In Africa, Latin America, and Asia and the Middle East.
[03:49:11.496 --> 03:49:27.066]  They then bring them to UN camps, brainwash them, then bring them to our border, brainwash them more, then send them into the United States, and then literally hold them for years at facilities while they're indoctrinated to be this new political underclass that's then going to be turned loose on America.
[03:49:27.406 --> 03:49:32.689]  And that's why you see Democrats giving illegal aliens the right to vote in their cities, giving them driver's licenses.
[03:49:33.029 --> 03:49:34.470]  That's why you see them passing laws.
[03:49:34.490 --> 03:49:35.611]  They can be police officers.
[03:49:35.971 --> 03:49:37.092]  So they are importing...
[03:49:37.612 --> 03:49:38.713]  We're good to go.
[03:49:58.175 --> 03:49:59.816]  So I don't understand.
[03:49:59.876 --> 03:50:01.256]  So you're from Texas.
[03:50:01.296 --> 03:50:02.236]  You grew up in Texas.
[03:50:02.276 --> 03:50:03.457]  Your family's been there a long time.
[03:50:04.177 --> 03:50:06.758]  Texas is changing really fast.
[03:50:07.258 --> 03:50:12.539]  It's dirty, for one thing, I notice, because physically dirty, garbage on the side of the road.
[03:50:12.960 --> 03:50:14.260]  I never have seen that in Texas before.
[03:50:14.800 --> 03:50:16.901]  So your governor could have stopped that.
[03:50:17.161 --> 03:50:19.782]  He commands the Texas National Guard, and he didn't.
[03:50:20.922 --> 03:50:23.983]  And I feel like that makes him a traitor to the country, but what am I missing?
[03:50:25.370 --> 03:50:34.938]  Well, I mean, Governor Abbott is, on a scale of 1 to 10, the best kind of Republican governor is a 10, and the worst is, say, a 1.
[03:50:35.899 --> 03:50:38.942]  And like the Illinois so-called Republican, that's really a Democrat.
[03:50:39.662 --> 03:50:40.783]  I would put Greg Abbott as about a 5.
[03:50:42.788 --> 03:50:45.109]  The state is overwhelmed.
[03:50:45.129 --> 03:50:48.071]  There isn't really a state mechanism.
[03:50:48.251 --> 03:50:50.652]  It's federal to kick people back and deport them.
[03:50:51.253 --> 03:50:52.493]  So they have put up barbed wire.
[03:50:52.533 --> 03:50:53.674]  They have tried to stop people.
[03:50:53.694 --> 03:50:56.896]  They have tried, but then they have to hand them over to the feds who release them.
[03:50:57.416 --> 03:50:59.457]  Well, why don't you say the feds are committing a crime.
[03:51:00.157 --> 03:51:00.878]  They're committing a crime.
[03:51:00.898 --> 03:51:03.579]  This is not allowed under laws passed by the Congress.
[03:51:03.719 --> 03:51:04.940]  In a democracy, Congress passed laws.
[03:51:05.660 --> 03:51:08.322]  And so you've got criminals running the country.
[03:51:08.342 --> 03:51:10.303]  The Biden administration is criminal, which is true.
[03:51:11.135 --> 03:51:12.796]  And we're not playing along.
[03:51:13.237 --> 03:51:14.698]  And if you don't like it, come do something about it.
[03:51:14.718 --> 03:51:20.262]  Meanwhile, every able-bodied man with a black rifle assembled at the border, and we're just going to stop this and save the country.
[03:51:20.282 --> 03:51:20.883]  I don't understand.
[03:51:20.903 --> 03:51:21.603]  That's not hard.
[03:51:22.524 --> 03:51:23.185]  What am I missing?
[03:51:23.465 --> 03:51:24.626]  No, I think you're absolutely right.
[03:51:24.646 --> 03:51:39.118]  In fact, what the deep state fears would be a coalition of good governors, good attorney generals giving them the findings and the rulings that they can indeed do that, and then declaring emergencies in the states and having a coalition of the states come in and do this.
[03:51:39.738 --> 03:51:40.158]  We're good to go.
[03:51:56.920 --> 03:51:57.240]  We're good to go.
[03:52:15.325 --> 03:52:16.805]  Somewhat cucked, to use that word again.
[03:52:17.306 --> 03:52:19.006]  And I think the governor has been cucked.
[03:52:19.346 --> 03:52:23.027]  He certainly went along with lockdowns and masks more than really any other Republican governor.
[03:52:23.888 --> 03:52:26.508]  And so I do think Greg Abbott needs to do a better job.
[03:52:27.089 --> 03:52:30.530]  But I also wanted to list some of the things that the state is up against.
[03:52:30.810 --> 03:52:31.450]  But I'll say this.
[03:52:32.330 --> 03:52:34.634]  Austin fired a bunch of police and another third quit.
[03:52:34.714 --> 03:52:38.940]  Crime everywhere, homeless everywhere, trash everywhere, ruined the city like everywhere else they are.
[03:52:39.601 --> 03:52:40.122]  You live there?
[03:52:40.803 --> 03:52:41.244]  Absolutely.
[03:52:41.805 --> 03:52:43.387]  That's where my family's from.
[03:52:43.447 --> 03:52:44.549]  I've been there since high school.
[03:52:45.190 --> 03:52:47.072]  But I'm going to have to leave soon because it's gotten...
[03:52:48.214 --> 03:52:48.694]  We're good to go.
[03:52:48.734 --> 03:52:49.255]  We're good to go.
[03:53:15.751 --> 03:53:16.091]  We're good to go.
[03:53:37.120 --> 03:53:45.488]  Elites of the world, the black rocks, the state streets, they're on record saying they don't want our consumer society.
[03:53:45.828 --> 03:53:47.369]  They don't want our capitalist society.
[03:53:48.090 --> 03:53:48.470]  It's bad.
[03:53:48.510 --> 03:53:48.831]  It's ugly.
[03:53:48.871 --> 03:53:49.271]  It's gross.
[03:53:49.311 --> 03:53:50.832]  But they're the biggest consumers.
[03:53:51.917 --> 03:53:52.117]  I think.
[03:53:52.157 --> 03:53:52.417]  I think.
[03:54:18.817 --> 03:54:19.297]  We're good to go.
[03:54:49.551 --> 03:54:49.811]  I think?
[03:55:14.554 --> 03:55:15.655]  Is the pandemic...
[03:55:33.593 --> 03:55:34.153]  Pandemic training.
[03:55:34.353 --> 03:55:34.533]  Yeah.
[03:55:35.093 --> 03:55:39.154]  So what this is, is really a breaking of our will, a demoralization.
[03:55:39.194 --> 03:55:46.656]  That's what the transgenderism is, and too many can have a baby, and puberty blockers, and castrating little boys, and cutting little girls' breasts off.
[03:55:47.016 --> 03:55:56.698]  They've got such hellish stuff coming in this designed global collapse to bring in their world government that they've got to just have all these horrors out there hoping we just...
[03:55:57.358 --> 03:56:02.799]  Throw up our hands and run off to the countryside, which everybody's doing, and in a way that's good.
[03:56:03.219 --> 03:56:05.280]  But at the same time, then, they've got full control.
[03:56:05.300 --> 03:56:06.280]  That's totally right.
[03:56:06.340 --> 03:56:09.301]  And they're going to march out of the countryside next and dig us out.
[03:56:09.601 --> 03:56:18.383]  So that's, I mean, you look at the White House press secretary, who can barely speak English, who's one of the stupidest people I've ever seen, and a transparent liar.
[03:56:18.783 --> 03:56:21.343]  You wouldn't hire her to run your copy machine.
[03:56:21.463 --> 03:56:22.424]  She's the White House press secretary.
[03:56:22.864 --> 03:56:23.684]  Why would you do that?
[03:56:24.224 --> 03:56:26.907]  And it's not because of her race or who she sleeps with.
[03:56:27.488 --> 03:56:33.794]  I think the whole point is she's so obviously repulsive that it makes you feel bad about the country to see her.
[03:56:34.055 --> 03:56:35.016]  I mean, that's it.
[03:56:35.436 --> 03:56:36.637]  We're at a beautiful ball.
[03:56:37.058 --> 03:56:37.919]  It's prom night.
[03:56:38.199 --> 03:56:39.040]  Everybody's dressed great.
[03:56:39.060 --> 03:56:39.921]  There's wonderful food.
[03:56:40.221 --> 03:56:41.302]  Big delicious punch bowl.
[03:56:41.903 --> 03:56:43.264]  And then they say, what can we do?
[03:56:43.324 --> 03:56:43.444]  Well...
[03:56:44.125 --> 03:56:46.066]  Just have Brian Stelter go take a dump right in that.
[03:56:46.327 --> 03:56:47.007]  Yeah.
[03:56:47.087 --> 03:56:49.149]  And then he's there laughing at you.
[03:56:49.169 --> 03:56:54.192]  They're all there laughing at you to make you feel small, to make you question reality.
[03:56:54.593 --> 03:56:55.673]  Why is everything so ugly?
[03:56:55.713 --> 03:56:58.415]  I mean, that's why they tell people, hey, you can be homeless anywhere.
[03:56:58.715 --> 03:56:59.936]  You can crap on the street.
[03:57:00.317 --> 03:57:01.838]  Needles, throw your garbage everywhere.
[03:57:02.538 --> 03:57:03.879]  Drug dealers can sell you drugs.
[03:57:04.439 --> 03:57:06.461]  We're going to give the homeless all this government funding.
[03:57:06.701 --> 03:57:12.325]  Liberal groups come in and farm and milk each homeless person and skim a big cut of the money off the top.
[03:57:12.805 --> 03:57:13.286]  It's a crop.
[03:57:13.826 --> 03:57:19.615]  But then you, a cash crop, but then we see that and we think it's all over, there's nothing we can do.
[03:57:20.572 --> 03:57:21.112]  We're good to go.
[03:57:21.212 --> 03:57:21.892]  We're good to go.
[03:57:47.226 --> 03:57:51.508]  29 years on air, all I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalists.
[03:57:52.228 --> 03:57:57.550]  And I've done the best job I can to tell the truth and be accurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[03:57:57.930 --> 03:58:04.372]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves, unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people.
[03:58:04.612 --> 03:58:05.292]  We don't do that.
[03:58:05.752 --> 03:58:07.633]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[03:58:08.013 --> 03:58:10.034]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product.
[03:58:10.074 --> 03:58:10.654]  It's so powerful.
[03:58:11.614 --> 03:58:21.643]  This is the breakdown product after your cells process it of folic acid, methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[03:58:22.103 --> 03:58:23.364]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[03:58:23.384 --> 03:58:24.225]  It's not a stimulant.
[03:58:24.485 --> 03:58:29.369]  It energizes your cells and then everything else you take just supercharges it.
[03:58:29.430 --> 03:58:30.250]  It's so insane.
[03:58:30.611 --> 03:58:32.072]  It's foundational energy.
[03:58:32.552 --> 03:58:36.695]  The strongest formula out there at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:58:37.096 --> 03:58:41.138]  It doesn't just energize this operation against the tyrants, it energizes you.
[03:58:41.419 --> 03:58:42.820]  Get foundational energy now!
[03:58:47.816 --> 03:58:59.630]  We are in the middle of a crude and ugly communist revolution funded by the big banks as a battering ram into a new age digital economy and a total surveillance state.
[03:59:00.090 --> 03:59:05.596]  All branches of government are attacking we the people and they offer us only one option.
[03:59:05.897 --> 03:59:08.119]  A meaningless vote in a rigged election.
[03:59:08.980 --> 03:59:10.842]  What we can do is be prepared.
[03:59:11.322 --> 03:59:19.668]  And you can support the InfoWar by shopping at InfoWarStore.com for products to help you through good times and bad.
[03:59:20.448 --> 03:59:23.250]  And you can share the videos at Banned.Video.
[03:59:23.871 --> 03:59:29.174]  Our best hope still is and always has been a mass awakening.
[03:59:29.635 --> 03:59:30.876]  So download the videos.
[03:59:31.696 --> 03:59:35.297]  Share them, upload them, and send them everywhere.
[03:59:35.977 --> 03:59:41.899]  Let the world unite for truth, justice, and 1776 worldwide.
[03:59:42.319 --> 03:59:54.203]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
