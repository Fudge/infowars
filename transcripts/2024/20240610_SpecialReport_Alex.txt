[00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:02.051]  The globalists have now come out of the closet.
[00:00:02.111 --> 00:00:03.052]  They've taken off the mask.
[00:00:03.532 --> 00:00:08.937]  They're now in major publications admitting their goal has always been to silence InfoWars.
[00:00:09.337 --> 00:00:14.962]  And it was the FBI and the Justice Department behind all these fake lawsuits against me to get me off the air.
[00:00:15.062 --> 00:00:21.488]  And now they're desperate right before the election, 147 days out, because they've got big plans for civil unrest.
[00:00:22.048 --> 00:00:30.498]  False flag terror attacks, war with Russia, you name it, as a pretext to bring this country into civil unrest that they will call civil war.
[00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:33.282]  That's why they want Infowars off the air right now.
[00:00:33.622 --> 00:00:34.924]  That's why this is so important.
[00:00:35.364 --> 00:00:38.027]  It's a clear sign of their next move.
[00:00:38.048 --> 00:00:47.367]   You can see them getting the public ready for all this tyranny, but It was just Alex Jones and a few others that got Trump into office before in the media.
[00:00:47.807 --> 00:00:55.752]  Now shutting us down isn't going to stop anything because the general public and all these other big talk show hosts, like Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan, and others understand what's happening.
[00:00:56.532 --> 00:01:06.318]  So the so-called Sandy Hook families are being used by the Justice Department, by the FBI to be the front people for this.
[00:01:06.718 --> 00:01:20.376]   When you read articles about Sandy Hook families agree to liquidate Infowars, just put in there, William Aldenberg, General Counsel for the FBI in Connecticut, who testified two years ago in court.
[00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:23.930]  That he went and organized all this against me.
[00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.531]  We now understand how all this happened.
[00:01:27.232 --> 00:01:39.397]  And so to the Justice Department, and to the people that have hijacked it, and to the CIA, and to the Deep State, and everybody that admitted in this article that they wanted to control what I was going to say, and control what I was going to do, or they were going to shut it down.
[00:01:39.938 --> 00:01:44.460]  They literally told me, well, we want you to back off the Second Amendment and a few other things, and then we'll leave you alone.
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.960]  Years ago.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.681]  Now they're saying it publicly.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.759]   in this article and others. So to anybody that thinks threats to shut me down or threats of
[00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.039]   money is going to get me to silence myself, that's my integrity and my soul and who I am,
[00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.760]  to quote Elon Musk, go fuck yourselves.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:08.561]   While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.080]   Well, it's Monday, June 10th, 2024, and thousands of corporate publications and all the main
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.640]   Democrat party shows are just celebrating Infowars to close, hip hip hooray, just like
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.760]   they thought all these fake trials on Trump and these fake indictments and this kangaroo court
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.560]  conviction would hurt Trump.
[00:02:32.728 --> 00:02:34.429]  Just like they thought a mug shot would hurt Trump.
[00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.551]  Yeah, you're hurting my crew and I'm sentimental about this place.
[00:02:37.571 --> 00:02:47.338]  But when I welled up with tears a week and a half ago on air when this first all started happening and I found out they were gonna try to close this place without even a court order and I stopped it.
[00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:56.925]  I broke down in tears seven hours into that marathon show because I was talking about America and the open borders and World War III and the 20 plus million dead from the shots.
[00:02:57.225 --> 00:02:57.966]  And I made that clear.
[00:02:59.051 --> 00:03:10.180]  I've got tears for joy how this is going to backfire on these tyrants, because people see this now more than ever for the tyrants trying to shut down this operation, and I'm a real rebel against the tyranny.
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:17.865]  So how many videos in the last decade have you seen me shoot right here with my own personal map?
[00:03:18.046 --> 00:03:23.250]  That's why Paul Watson has the same map, because I sent him this over a similar map 15 years ago.
[00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.951]  It was a little bit smaller, but the same map.
[00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:28.770]  This map used to be me in the old studio.
[00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:30.711]  That's my personal map.
[00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:32.012]  Here's my personal art.
[00:03:32.772 --> 00:03:35.894]  My personal stuff that's getting loaded up today.
[00:03:36.694 --> 00:03:37.875]  You know, a lot of history.
[00:03:37.895 --> 00:03:40.516]  My buddy gave me this little poster for Caddyshack.
[00:03:40.576 --> 00:03:41.336]  I love Caddyshack.
[00:03:43.137 --> 00:03:45.178]  Great artist, you know, sent us a lot of things over the years.
[00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.240]  This is a fun thing that the crew gave me as a gift.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.842]  This, uh, I'll eat your ass with a Gatsby flag.
[00:03:53.792 --> 00:04:04.918]  So it's really made me sentimental because being in the same building 15 years, having him for 27 years, you love it but you also hate it because there's a lot of work, sweat, and tears that go into it.
[00:04:04.938 --> 00:04:12.282]  So it's exciting to know this is blown up in their face and just like when they shut down Tucker Carlson on Fox, made him 15, 20 times bigger.
[00:04:13.263 --> 00:04:19.406]  Well, it's the same thing here, but they've hurt the crew, so I guess they're happy about that.
[00:04:20.607 --> 00:04:22.768]  But all my personal stuff is off the walls.
[00:04:23.974 --> 00:04:24.854]  And that's just where we are.
[00:04:24.914 --> 00:04:27.875]  So I thought I would give you a little bit of a tour of this place.
[00:04:29.155 --> 00:04:31.995]  And so you can just see where we did so much amazing work.
[00:04:33.236 --> 00:04:35.936]  And again, we have three crews that come in over the day.
[00:04:36.616 --> 00:04:37.956]  So you'll see some of these studios are empty.
[00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:41.477]  I'll take you to one of the studios that's full of folks right now.
[00:04:41.717 --> 00:04:45.598]  But here's where we have bomb lunch sometimes.
[00:04:46.258 --> 00:04:47.598]  Here's where we've had some of the crew.
[00:04:48.138 --> 00:04:52.059]  Most folks knowing it was shutting down the last six months without other jobs.
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.581]  We still got a few folks that work in here, on the social media and things like that.
[00:04:57.601 --> 00:05:03.363]  And then you've got my office down here.
[00:05:03.383 --> 00:05:08.664]  It's now, now had the art taken off the walls.
[00:05:09.144 --> 00:05:17.046]  And remember, when they tried to shut this thing down without a court order, just, here's my office, stuff's off the walls here.
[00:05:17.886 --> 00:05:21.427]  They tried to claim that I'd made that up.
[00:05:23.507 --> 00:05:25.507]  Here's the affiliate relations room.
[00:05:25.347 --> 00:05:32.427]   the truth. Got a little break room in here. This is just a historic. That's a little
[00:05:32.427 --> 00:05:37.747]   Bohemian Grove poster. David Deeds. David Deeds, we've had that like 15 years. Here's the
[00:05:37.747 --> 00:05:44.186]   affiliate relations room. We've got the radio stations and all the fun stuff and
[00:05:44.186 --> 00:05:50.987]   the work we've done over the years. Those guys aren't in yet. They come in about
[00:05:50.987 --> 00:05:57.907]   20 minutes. We're shooting this about 8 30 in the morning, 9 in the morning. We've got
[00:05:57.907 --> 00:06:03.587]  radio producer room in here.
[00:06:01.574 --> 00:06:03.635]  Some of the fun stuff we got.
[00:06:04.595 --> 00:06:05.255]  Hang on the walls.
[00:06:07.156 --> 00:06:13.919]  And then we've got our room for the afternoon and evening riders in here.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.120]  Got some fun stuff from over the years.
[00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:19.121]  Petrier Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:06:19.141 --> 00:06:23.103]  You know, with the famous map and all that.
[00:06:24.281 --> 00:06:26.081]  When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.
[00:06:26.101 --> 00:06:28.782]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[00:06:28.822 --> 00:06:31.083]  So much, so much history in here.
[00:06:31.103 --> 00:06:36.704]  We probably should have turned the lights on before I decided to do this tour, but I didn't think that I'd still turn them on here.
[00:06:39.245 --> 00:06:43.786]  This is the original studio from 15 years ago.
[00:06:44.546 --> 00:06:47.947]  We turned it into a podcast studio, but the desk was here, and I looked out that way.
[00:06:48.827 --> 00:06:49.887]  So, a lot of history.
[00:06:49.907 --> 00:06:52.348]  A lot of stuff happened.
[00:06:53.814 --> 00:06:54.474]  A lot of cool stuff.
[00:06:54.514 --> 00:06:55.195]  I haven't been in here.
[00:06:55.235 --> 00:06:57.156]  Oh, this is some of my other stuff I've got to take.
[00:06:58.017 --> 00:06:59.038]  The Best of Austin.
[00:07:00.238 --> 00:07:02.840]  The Austin American Statesman about the black helicopters that didn't exist.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.761]  They now admit all exists.
[00:07:03.781 --> 00:07:04.321]  This is mine.
[00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:06.062]  Need to get that.
[00:07:06.082 --> 00:07:10.165]  A bunch of my books.
[00:07:10.185 --> 00:07:11.546]  The Great Reset and The War for the World.
[00:07:12.367 --> 00:07:13.607]  Number one New York Times bestseller.
[00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:25.484]   But they censored that and said they were going to give me that even though it was the number one in the Wall Street Journal book list and USA Today and every other But that's how the cheating system works.
[00:07:26.104 --> 00:07:26.925]  And this is a great room.
[00:07:26.965 --> 00:07:28.405]  We probably need to kick some of the lights on.
[00:07:28.946 --> 00:07:32.627]  I had these banners designed, what, about 12 years ago?
[00:07:32.647 --> 00:07:33.848]  10 years?
[00:07:33.868 --> 00:07:34.668]  11 years ago?
[00:07:35.429 --> 00:07:36.109]  This is my idea.
[00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:37.850]  George Washington.
[00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:39.731]  Don't tread on me.
[00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:41.652]  Moe Adelabe.
[00:07:42.852 --> 00:07:45.314]  And, again, this is the control room for radio, TV.
[00:07:45.894 --> 00:07:48.175]  We have the encoders here.
[00:07:48.954 --> 00:07:54.713]  We have all the systems.
[00:07:54.713 --> 00:07:59.354]  Come in here. This great classic studio where Trump won.
[00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:04.213]  We were in here and we did the champagne toast right there.
[00:08:05.273 --> 00:08:11.597]  So much history has happened here, but by the system coming in to shut this down.
[00:08:12.918 --> 00:08:16.079]  It's only going to make all the great work we did previously that much stronger.
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:25.644]  When I look at Bitcoin as a historian, I don't like it because this is a money built on distrust.
[00:08:26.524 --> 00:08:29.806]  The central idea of Bitcoin is basically electronic gold.
[00:08:30.606 --> 00:08:39.478]  That we don't trust the banks, the governments, so we don't want to give them the ability to create as much money as they like.
[00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:41.861]  So we create this Bitcoin.
[00:08:42.421 --> 00:08:44.484]  It's a currency of distrust.
[00:08:45.325 --> 00:08:48.369]  I do think that the future belongs to electronic money.
[00:08:49.290 --> 00:09:04.547]  But what we've seen over the last centuries is that it's actually a good idea to give banks and governments the ability to create more and more money for themselves in order to build more trust within society.
[00:09:05.868 --> 00:09:19.514]  So I'm not sure what kind, what money would look like in 20 years or 30 years, but I hope it will be a currency of greater trust and not a currency of distrust.
[00:09:19.834 --> 00:09:23.596]  Finishing up, you all know Harari and just how full of crap he is as an economist.
[00:09:24.176 --> 00:09:25.377]  You as an economist watching him.
[00:09:26.624 --> 00:09:29.766]  So I'm watching that and I'm thinking, is this guy absolutely nuts?
[00:09:30.026 --> 00:09:31.187]  I mean, he is a smart guy.
[00:09:31.247 --> 00:09:33.129]  He's evil, but he's a smart guy.
[00:09:33.589 --> 00:09:41.995]  How could he say that printing money is going to bring trust when so much in our society right now is people can't afford to eat.
[00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:48.239]  They can't afford to pay their mortgage or their rent or buy food or do anything, right?
[00:09:48.439 --> 00:09:51.141]  Inflation doesn't bring trust.
[00:09:51.701 --> 00:09:53.643]  He's misusing the word trust.
[00:09:54.463 --> 00:09:58.974]  Because what he's actually saying is, hey, when we print money...
[00:09:59.733 --> 00:10:04.855]  We're going to be able to give you Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, handouts, stimulus.
[00:10:05.535 --> 00:10:08.797]  We'll raise the debt ceiling to keep this game perpetuated.
[00:10:09.217 --> 00:10:10.618]  We'll do all of this stuff.
[00:10:11.238 --> 00:10:14.699]  And so then the people will say, trust?
[00:10:14.779 --> 00:10:14.959]  What?
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.541]  It's like, I'll tolerate you because you're giving me free stuff.
[00:10:19.141 --> 00:10:20.302]  That's not trust.
[00:10:20.762 --> 00:10:24.764]  That's accepting their garbage because they're giving you free stuff.
[00:10:24.824 --> 00:10:27.205]  That comes with printing of money excessively.
[00:10:28.445 --> 00:10:31.606]  Misuse of the word trust because I don't think he's a dumb guy.
[00:10:31.626 --> 00:10:37.068]  I think he's evil, beyond evil, who has no respect for human life.
[00:10:37.268 --> 00:10:40.229]  They just said that we're going to continue to print money.
[00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:47.092]  We're going to continue to make people dependent on the government for all of their needs.
[00:10:47.632 --> 00:10:52.074]  Because the government wants to take the place of God in people's lives.
[00:10:52.534 --> 00:10:56.376]  And that statement, when you dissect what he said, that's what he's saying.
[00:10:56.896 --> 00:10:58.837]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[00:10:59.117 --> 00:10:59.597]  Check them out.
[00:10:59.657 --> 00:11:00.257]  Go on the site.
[00:11:00.697 --> 00:11:01.078]  Call them.
[00:11:01.138 --> 00:11:01.998]  Get a consultation.
[00:11:02.098 --> 00:11:02.538]  Email them.
[00:11:02.558 --> 00:11:03.078]  Talk to them.
[00:11:03.098 --> 00:11:03.418]  720-605-3900.
[00:11:03.277 --> 00:11:12.077]   720-605-3900. Again, that's 720-605-3900. One of the most important calls you would
[00:11:12.077 --> 00:11:16.796]   make, obviously, and like he was saying, get silver, up 40% on the year. He says that he'll
[00:11:16.796 --> 00:11:20.877]   make such profits in silver, when the gold run starts, you use that profit to buy the gold,
[00:11:20.877 --> 00:11:26.717]   and you sell it back to Dr. Kirk Elliott with zero cost, which no big broker, no big company does.
[00:11:26.717 --> 00:11:32.087]  That's why there are 4.7 star ratings that nobody else has.
[00:11:32.087 --> 00:11:34.237]  Kepm.com/gold, Kepm.com/gold.
[00:11:34.237 --> 00:11:41.757]  [Foreign]
[00:11:41.772 --> 00:11:42.672]  What did he just say?
[00:11:44.033 --> 00:11:45.673]  He said there's a storm coming in.
[00:11:50.655 --> 00:11:51.055]  I know.
[00:11:52.796 --> 00:11:56.317]  We told you what was going to happen and it did.
[00:11:56.697 --> 00:12:02.697]  Now we're telling you what's coming at Real Alex Jones on X.
[00:12:02.697 --> 00:12:24.457]   And now here we are on the verge of World War III and these maps are just another illustration of
[00:12:24.457 --> 00:12:27.896]   how I can shoot a video in front of any one of these maps I wanted to
[00:12:27.896 --> 00:12:32.298]  about what was happening in the world at any one time.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.641]  And I designed this studio.
[00:12:35.162 --> 00:12:37.203]  Again, they got built about 12 years ago.
[00:12:37.264 --> 00:12:37.924]  So much history.
[00:12:38.004 --> 00:12:41.427]  Owen's been in here for, just in this studio for five, six years.
[00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:46.690]  And it's just amazing to be at this point.
[00:12:48.051 --> 00:12:52.731]  A lot of mixed feelings about it, but God closes one door and another door opens.
[00:12:52.771 --> 00:12:56.532]  The Democrats now admitted in Reuters or where else that they indeed did want to just shut me down.
[00:12:57.652 --> 00:12:58.512]  It was never about money.
[00:12:59.453 --> 00:13:08.634]  It was always about silencing us and then your full back loop where we were.
[00:13:10.234 --> 00:13:13.395]  And my stuff off the wall is about to be put in storage today.
[00:13:17.349 --> 00:13:24.892]  We've got this great control room, where for the last four years or so we've been doing the show.
[00:13:25.892 --> 00:13:33.514]  It was my plan to have a 24-hour network, but with all the enemy attacks and things that happened, that slowed us down so it never got done, but we've still had a great effect.
[00:13:34.255 --> 00:13:36.836]  Got a fun wall here with some cool stuff on it.
[00:13:38.776 --> 00:13:41.697]  And you've got Chase Geiser in here in his office.
[00:13:43.638 --> 00:13:45.558]  Chase, we're giving a tour here of InfoWars.
[00:13:45.578 --> 00:13:46.119]  Got any comments?
[00:13:46.139 --> 00:13:46.919]  You didn't know we were coming in here.
[00:13:47.338 --> 00:13:48.840]  No, it was awesome working here.
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.102]  This is an awesome office.
[00:13:50.462 --> 00:13:54.487]  Obviously, it's torn apart right now because all my personal stuff's at home, but next thing's gonna be even better.
[00:13:54.647 --> 00:13:55.769]  What'd you think of it?
[00:13:57.691 --> 00:14:01.814]  What'd you think of Infowars before you worked here in the last 14 months versus once you got here?
[00:14:02.455 --> 00:14:02.855]  Yeah.
[00:14:02.975 --> 00:14:05.537]  So before I worked here, I had no idea what it was going to be like.
[00:14:05.557 --> 00:14:07.879]  I was a listener since January 6th of 2021.
[00:14:07.939 --> 00:14:11.381]  That's when I really started listening to you.
[00:14:12.122 --> 00:14:18.747]  And I was really surprised when I did get here, how everybody here was like me, because there's not a lot of people like me out there.
[00:14:18.787 --> 00:14:20.288]  And so it just felt like family right away.
[00:14:20.468 --> 00:14:21.829]  It's a very special group of people here.
[00:14:21.849 --> 00:14:22.269]  Very unique.
[00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:24.591]  This is going to backfire on them.
[00:14:24.931 --> 00:14:25.952]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:27.760]  Something else, man.
[00:14:29.081 --> 00:14:30.602]  Crazy stuff, the Tucker tour coming up.
[00:14:30.802 --> 00:14:31.962]  Congratulations, that's awesome.
[00:14:32.022 --> 00:14:32.563]  I love Tucker.
[00:14:32.863 --> 00:14:33.723]  I'm gonna go on tour with Tucker.
[00:14:34.344 --> 00:14:35.004]  Thank you, Chase.
[00:14:35.024 --> 00:14:35.464]  You're welcome.
[00:14:36.865 --> 00:14:39.606]  And of course, here we are.
[00:14:39.626 --> 00:14:43.588]  This is the more modern, cool studio.
[00:14:43.648 --> 00:14:44.588]  I love them all.
[00:14:45.609 --> 00:14:48.150]  This is where I'm doing the show.
[00:14:49.371 --> 00:14:50.411]  Got yesterday's news there.
[00:14:50.431 --> 00:14:56.094]  I'll take it off the desk in a few minutes when we're done here and start going through all the new news and going over the video clips and getting ready with the crew.
[00:14:59.522 --> 00:15:01.264]  And you know, that American flag's not mine.
[00:15:01.284 --> 00:15:02.244]  That got hung up by the crew.
[00:15:03.045 --> 00:15:09.350]  But we did not leave these flags here when it shuts down, so we probably needed to fold those up properly, respect those.
[00:15:12.953 --> 00:15:13.414]  There we go.
[00:15:15.275 --> 00:15:19.078]  And then, you got the green room for guests.
[00:15:23.442 --> 00:15:24.023]  Pretty simple.
[00:15:25.964 --> 00:15:26.805]  I'm just documenting this.
[00:15:28.114 --> 00:15:28.574]  For history.
[00:15:28.855 --> 00:15:32.778]  And Rob, if you want to come back after we shoot this and get some better B-roll.
[00:15:33.439 --> 00:15:33.679]  Okay.
[00:15:33.519 --> 00:15:37.358]   put over some of the great paintings and whole stuff feel free to do that.
[00:15:37.358 --> 00:15:44.318]  Anyway some clippings here.
[00:15:44.529 --> 00:15:48.553]  Was in a little better shape then.
[00:15:48.573 --> 00:15:51.436]  Fun times.
[00:15:55.148 --> 00:16:03.756]  That's what I'm thinking, you know, when they shut this place down, I'm thinking, I'll still do interviews and stuff for a while before we launch something else with somebody else, but I want to take some time to hit the gym really hard.
[00:16:03.816 --> 00:16:04.857]  I've already lost like 15 pounds.
[00:16:04.877 --> 00:16:05.718]  I want to lose like 30.
[00:16:07.139 --> 00:16:10.682]  We're doing a live show in here.
[00:16:10.702 --> 00:16:12.924]  Harrison Smith.
[00:16:14.064 --> 00:16:21.064]  We've got on screen the smartest man in the world.
[00:16:22.064 --> 00:16:22.444]   Where it's usually a big deal, but it seems too crazy to be true, so I go to verify it, and it's like, I can't verify
[00:16:22.444 --> 00:16:29.064]  it or not. It doesn't exist outside of...
[00:16:29.914 --> 00:16:33.095]  And then here's the real rat's nest, Rob Doo's office.
[00:16:33.115 --> 00:16:34.296]  The Java Landcrawler.
[00:16:34.356 --> 00:16:37.117]  A bunch of Minecrafts back there too.
[00:16:36.936 --> 00:16:43.096]   The world awakening we're witnessing and the establishment doesn't know what to do.
[00:16:43.096 --> 00:16:47.215]  And then here's the real rat's nest, Rob Doo's office.
[00:16:47.215 --> 00:16:48.215]  The Java land crawler.
[00:16:48.215 --> 00:16:50.736]  A bunch of Minecrafts back there too.
[00:16:50.736 --> 00:16:54.135]  Most of the stuff's off the walls.
[00:16:54.135 --> 00:16:58.696]   But now even stuff I wasn't going to take with me, now I actually care about it all
[00:16:58.696 --> 00:16:59.896]  and I want to take everything.
[00:17:00.306 --> 00:17:01.346]  Like all the pictures.
[00:17:02.267 --> 00:17:07.250]  My son made this with Photoshop about 5 or 6 years ago and I guess it came true.
[00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:07.890]  The hair fell out.
[00:17:09.471 --> 00:17:10.231]  So there's Lex Luthor.
[00:17:11.872 --> 00:17:13.133]  So here we are ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:13.953 --> 00:17:14.654]  That's basically it.
[00:17:14.674 --> 00:17:16.415]  Let's go back to where we started here.
[00:17:16.775 --> 00:17:17.415]  Back to the map.
[00:17:19.617 --> 00:17:20.957]  And just kind of close this out.
[00:17:20.977 --> 00:17:23.519]  I just wanted people to get a little glimpse.
[00:17:25.405 --> 00:17:33.770]  Inside of here, you know, there's some other offices, the armored truck and all those type of things, but and Owen's offices and some offices of folks.
[00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:36.452]  We got Ben over here doing a great job writing.
[00:17:38.113 --> 00:17:40.394]  You want to say anything about what it's like to see what's happening?
[00:17:40.554 --> 00:17:46.078]  Oh, it's surreal and I'm in your corner always and God bless this crew and Alex.
[00:17:46.758 --> 00:17:48.639]  It's one of a kind, every aspect of it.
[00:17:49.039 --> 00:17:50.961]  To me, it's an honor to have the Deep State come after us.
[00:17:51.461 --> 00:17:51.621]  Oh, yeah.
[00:17:53.817 --> 00:17:55.677]  You were here when they tried to shut it down last Friday.
[00:17:56.358 --> 00:17:56.618]  Yes.
[00:17:57.318 --> 00:17:58.718]  That was a ride.
[00:17:58.738 --> 00:18:02.619]  It was breakneck, all of the developments as they were happening.
[00:18:02.699 --> 00:18:06.560]  We covered it well Friday, and you knocked it out the park Saturday with that legendary broadcast.
[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:09.821]  People didn't mean to try to deny it, but then later admitted it.
[00:18:10.501 --> 00:18:11.962]  That doesn't surprise me in the slightest.
[00:18:12.122 --> 00:18:16.283]  That was total textbook how they handled it, and we held our ground.
[00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:20.572]  We're really, uh, had good responses Monday and onward.
[00:18:20.912 --> 00:18:23.995]  I wonder why they wanted us off sooner than they were gonna get.
[00:18:25.496 --> 00:18:27.277]  Rob, let me get you to make some comments here.
[00:18:27.297 --> 00:18:28.979]  Come on over here and I'll get you to make some comments.
[00:18:32.061 --> 00:18:34.043]  Uh, well, let's see.
[00:18:34.083 --> 00:18:37.365]  When I first got here, I think, I remember my interview.
[00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:41.369]  You were, uh, you were interviewing the guy, the, the, who was it?
[00:18:41.429 --> 00:18:43.971]  The, uh, the sheriff never get busted guy.
[00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:49.734]  And I was in that office where the writers are getting interviewed by one of the producers.
[00:18:50.855 --> 00:18:55.339]  And you came in and I was pulling out DVDs of stuff I had produced throughout the years.
[00:18:55.739 --> 00:18:58.602]  And you walk in, you look at them, you're flipping through them.
[00:18:59.022 --> 00:19:04.327]  We talked about a project real quick and you go, this is the kind of thinking we need around here.
[00:19:04.347 --> 00:19:06.028]  And you walked out to go back and do the show.
[00:19:06.188 --> 00:19:06.889]  It was during a break.
[00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.292]  And the guy looks at me, his name was Mike.
[00:19:11.306 --> 00:19:14.227]  And he looks at me and goes, I guess you got the job.
[00:19:14.267 --> 00:19:14.927]  Just like that.
[00:19:14.947 --> 00:19:18.128]  And so that started... You've been here, what, 15 years?
[00:19:18.288 --> 00:19:21.569]  Yeah, February 9th, 2009 was my first day.
[00:19:22.149 --> 00:19:31.491]  So, seeing the different people come in and out of here, seeing all the guests, all the history, going out in the streets, going to the different events.
[00:19:31.652 --> 00:19:34.112]  I mean, I think one of the big highlights was that 2016...
[00:19:37.433 --> 00:19:38.834]  Is it 2015 RNC or 2016?
[00:19:39.495 --> 00:19:43.478]  2016 RNC when we confronted the Young Turks.
[00:19:44.199 --> 00:19:44.699]  That was fun.
[00:19:45.019 --> 00:19:45.880]  That was badass.
[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.502]  Oh, we gotta re-upload that to X. Yeah, we'll re-upload that.
[00:19:48.522 --> 00:19:50.324]  I like the longest version of it with all the behind the scenes.
[00:19:50.684 --> 00:19:50.844]  Yeah.
[00:19:50.864 --> 00:19:52.325]  I think it was the version where I described what happened.
[00:19:52.486 --> 00:19:54.828]  Yeah, and then there's a... Remember, they lied.
[00:19:54.848 --> 00:19:56.029]  It was all an open area.
[00:19:56.069 --> 00:19:56.249]  Right.
[00:19:56.329 --> 00:19:58.571]  Hundreds of other broadcasters, they waved to the server and said, we'll be back later.
[00:19:58.591 --> 00:19:59.151]  They don't want to break.
[00:19:59.211 --> 00:20:01.053]  I jump up and they make it up that I was attacking them.
[00:20:01.073 --> 00:20:01.293]  Right.
[00:20:01.433 --> 00:20:02.614]  When they see Roger Stone with us.
[00:20:03.014 --> 00:20:03.455]  Exactly.
[00:20:03.475 --> 00:20:04.455]  They freak out.
[00:20:04.556 --> 00:20:06.077]  Chink freaks out on Roger Stone.
[00:20:07.074 --> 00:20:12.218]  And it was just amazing to see how, what was crazy is how viral that went.
[00:20:12.478 --> 00:20:15.360]  We had 100,000 views on it in about 10 minutes on YouTube.
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.362]  And then they cut our feed.
[00:20:18.122 --> 00:20:23.046]  They wouldn't let people see it anymore until the Young Turks could get all their stuff together to put their version up.
[00:20:23.226 --> 00:20:24.527]  But we were using iPhones.
[00:20:24.627 --> 00:20:26.869]  I immediately uploaded it after we shot it.
[00:20:27.749 --> 00:20:31.052]  And you were doing another interview and that was already up.
[00:20:31.072 --> 00:20:32.713]  They did not like that at all.
[00:20:32.993 --> 00:20:37.576]  That we were able to put out our narrative of the version of what happened.
[00:20:39.057 --> 00:20:41.519]  And they couldn't do that.
[00:20:41.719 --> 00:20:47.183]  And so they killed ours, put theirs up, and then they allowed ours to come back on later on in the day.
[00:20:47.683 --> 00:20:49.124]  Total information management.
[00:20:49.284 --> 00:20:49.485]  Yeah.
[00:20:49.885 --> 00:20:50.645]  That's what they have to do.
[00:20:50.665 --> 00:20:52.807]  They have to control every bit of the message.
[00:20:53.493 --> 00:20:59.597]  That's why they don't want people talking about COVID, that's why they don't want people talking about the shot, and that's why we talked about it.
[00:20:59.657 --> 00:21:01.879]  We've always went on the subjects.
[00:21:01.899 --> 00:21:07.142]  9-11, you know, now people... Every one of these books is a story because almost all these are guests that we're on.
[00:21:07.182 --> 00:21:10.244]  Yeah, but like 9-11, now people are talking about Building 7.
[00:21:10.824 --> 00:21:13.026]  How long, how many years have you been talking about Building 7?
[00:21:13.066 --> 00:21:14.087]  We're talking about day one, when it happened.
[00:21:14.107 --> 00:21:14.487]  Exactly.
[00:21:15.087 --> 00:21:21.271]  And so, you know, now these things are safe to talk about because, you know, InfoWars pushed it forward.
[00:21:21.591 --> 00:21:33.419]  InfoWars was able to get the news out, show the behind-the-scenes stuff they didn't want to see, or the documents even, to show all this stuff, how it was going on, and then show how these people control you, how they manage the message.
[00:21:33.459 --> 00:21:34.360]  And it's all of them.
[00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.781]  All of them right there, they manage the message.
[00:21:36.321 --> 00:21:39.983]  This is the right wing of the bird, and then you got a lot of left wings over here.
[00:21:41.404 --> 00:21:42.425]  All very interesting, Rob.
[00:21:44.232 --> 00:21:46.934]  Why do you think they went ahead and shut it down even though it's going to backfire?
[00:21:46.954 --> 00:21:48.415]  They just hate us so much they can't help it?
[00:21:49.156 --> 00:21:50.837]  Or they got something planned for this summer.
[00:21:50.897 --> 00:21:53.059]  I think they got something planned for Trump.
[00:21:53.879 --> 00:21:56.482]  And they don't want me on air talking about it at the time.
[00:21:56.622 --> 00:21:57.082]  Exactly.
[00:21:57.122 --> 00:21:59.244]  That's why they're going to shut down the court order.
[00:21:59.564 --> 00:21:59.764]  Right.
[00:22:00.945 --> 00:22:02.186]  So I think something's going to happen there.
[00:22:02.746 --> 00:22:05.128]  And then I think something's going to happen at the convention.
[00:22:05.168 --> 00:22:09.311]  But I've already got delegates inside the convention that are ready to contact me if anything funny happens.
[00:22:09.331 --> 00:22:10.552]  Yeah, we've got a lot of stuff going on.
[00:22:10.753 --> 00:22:12.214]  So, folks, here's the bottom line.
[00:22:13.297 --> 00:22:14.138]  I want to thank you all.
[00:22:14.198 --> 00:22:15.279]  I want to appreciate you all.
[00:22:15.299 --> 00:22:19.284]  I don't think they're going to settle with us.
[00:22:19.304 --> 00:22:20.725]  They told Reuters it was never about money.
[00:22:20.745 --> 00:22:24.249]  They were never going to settle unless I went under their control, unless I did what they said.
[00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:25.391]  They told us that.
[00:22:26.292 --> 00:22:26.992]  That's a non-starter.
[00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:27.573]  It's not going to happen.
[00:22:30.598 --> 00:22:36.206]  If you want to support what I'm doing into the future, my dad's company drjonesnaturals.com has incredible supplements of products.
[00:22:36.667 --> 00:22:39.871]  All the products you can't get at InfoWars anymore are there and other ones you can't get will be there.
[00:22:40.392 --> 00:22:43.156]  So mark down drjonesnaturals.com, one word.
[00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:51.666]  And go there if you want to support what we're doing and want to be able to see First Amendment America continue on.
[00:22:52.166 --> 00:22:58.211]  We've got a lot of opportunities, a lot of stuff, but they want me out of the game scrambling for whatever's about to happen in the next 140, 142 days.
[00:22:58.251 --> 00:22:59.972]  How many days has it been?
[00:23:00.052 --> 00:23:00.132]  It's 140.
[00:23:00.352 --> 00:23:01.994]  No, I think it's 142.
[00:23:02.094 --> 00:23:04.513]  It's 140.
[00:23:04.513 --> 00:23:06.432]  Yeah, 149 or 150 around there.
[00:23:06.432 --> 00:23:07.594]  No, I think it's 142.
[00:23:07.594 --> 00:23:08.834]  142, okay.
[00:23:08.834 --> 00:23:09.713]  It's flying.
[00:23:09.713 --> 00:23:11.432]  No, no, it's definitely flying.
[00:23:11.432 --> 00:23:13.794]  They'll know in here.
[00:23:14.491 --> 00:23:15.192]  Sorry to stump you.
[00:23:15.232 --> 00:23:17.113]  I think we have a countdown.
[00:23:17.673 --> 00:23:22.917]  How many days is the election?
[00:23:23.237 --> 00:23:22.917]  147.
[00:23:23.318 --> 00:23:25.479]  So we're both wrong.
[00:23:25.499 --> 00:23:25.479]  147.
[00:23:25.739 --> 00:23:27.180]  Or maybe you were, what did you say, 148?
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.162]  I was a bit north of that.
[00:23:30.903 --> 00:23:31.583]  No, no, no, I was wrong.
[00:23:31.623 --> 00:23:32.204]  I said 142 or 3.
[00:23:32.404 --> 00:23:32.624]  I said 59, 41.
[00:23:34.505 --> 00:23:35.026]  It doesn't matter.
[00:23:35.146 --> 00:23:35.566]  Well, there you go.
[00:23:35.586 --> 00:23:35.666]  It's 147.
[00:23:37.051 --> 00:23:45.602]  So basically, you know, parting is such sweet sorrows, but we're going to save the republic, ladies and gentlemen, and we're going to try to turn all this around.
[00:23:46.342 --> 00:23:52.870]  I just, this has been a real education too, seeing the belly of the beast, the FBI, CIA, operation, all the admissions now all coming out.
[00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:53.471]  They just don't care.
[00:23:54.412 --> 00:23:55.253]  They think they're going to win.
[00:23:55.293 --> 00:23:56.334]  They think they're the establishment.
[00:23:56.374 --> 00:23:57.175]  They think they're insulated.
[00:23:57.195 --> 00:23:59.757]  They create these fake narratives, these things nobody didn't do.
[00:24:00.178 --> 00:24:01.359]  Trump says all Mexicans are evil.
[00:24:01.399 --> 00:24:02.380]  Never said anything close to that.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.242]  Never did the things they said I did to Sandy Hook people.
[00:24:06.043 --> 00:24:07.905]  They just had PR firms say, Alex is doing this.
[00:24:07.965 --> 00:24:08.686]  Alex is doing this.
[00:24:09.126 --> 00:24:16.113]  Taking stuff out of context from seven, eight years before, and then found me in default for no reason after they got all of our information.
[00:24:17.424 --> 00:24:18.685]  And then they had no evidence.
[00:24:18.725 --> 00:24:20.546]  So then they found me guilty at show trials.
[00:24:20.626 --> 00:24:31.033]  And now here we are just absolutely, you know, wild stuff going on from the deep state, all a bunch of former and current federal prosecutors admitting to it all and doing it.
[00:24:31.073 --> 00:24:32.433]  They really think this country's theirs.
[00:24:32.454 --> 00:24:32.954]  They really think.
[00:24:34.107 --> 00:24:42.557]  They're going to be able to destroy the free speech in this country and take all of our rights and freedoms and literally have new COVID lockdowns, new bird flu lockdowns, forced injections, UN treaties.
[00:24:42.938 --> 00:24:44.259]  Everything I told you is coming true.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.984]  Everything I warned you about is unfolding right now.
[00:24:48.064 --> 00:24:50.106]  And it's only going to get worse until people stand up and say no.
[00:24:50.346 --> 00:24:51.888]  They're shutting down farms all over the world.
[00:24:53.065 --> 00:24:57.146]  All the big companies are saying, we're going to put bug protein in your food whether you like it or not.
[00:24:57.566 --> 00:24:58.906]  I mean, this is a rape, folks.
[00:24:58.926 --> 00:25:02.727]  This is mad scientists going absolutely crazy.
[00:25:03.767 --> 00:25:06.707]  So Rob, shoot some B-roll, some cool stuff around here.
[00:25:07.228 --> 00:25:08.228]  Add any other clips you want.
[00:25:08.288 --> 00:25:11.628]  I just had this idea this morning, you know, to do this.
[00:25:11.648 --> 00:25:12.828]  I'm going to go get ready for my show.
[00:25:13.329 --> 00:25:17.689]  It starts about almost two hours from now, or I guess an hour and 30 minutes from now.
[00:25:18.129 --> 00:25:19.810]  And I love you all, and I appreciate you all.
[00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:22.817]   People are asking, Where do we find you in the future?
[00:25:23.257 --> 00:25:24.919]  I haven't set up any new plans.
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.002]  I've stayed loyal to this place until the bitter end.
[00:25:27.022 --> 00:25:28.064]  Let's talk about that.
[00:25:28.945 --> 00:25:37.257]  But you need to know that as soon as this gets shut down, like a firing gun getting shot at the start of a race, we're going to be boom.
[00:25:39.946 --> 00:25:41.688]  They can't shut me up, okay?
[00:25:41.828 --> 00:25:42.709]  They're not going to shut me up.
[00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:51.297]  And there's a lot of folks that understand the First Amendment, the law, that I'll be able to work for somebody else and be able to stay on the air and come back even bigger.
[00:25:51.657 --> 00:25:53.839]  They're, of course, going to attack that as well, but the law is clear.
[00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.862]  I haven't even begun to deal with that.
[00:25:57.883 --> 00:26:00.926]  Now I'm just trying to explain what's happening here and what's going on currently.
[00:26:01.406 --> 00:26:02.567]  People say, well, where do we find you?
[00:26:03.656 --> 00:26:08.458]  When this thing shuts down at RealAlexJones on X. I haven't set up a new website.
[00:26:08.498 --> 00:26:09.759]  I haven't set up a new operation.
[00:26:09.799 --> 00:26:11.099]  I haven't set up any of this stuff.
[00:26:11.599 --> 00:26:13.920]  I've got a little studio in my house.
[00:26:15.101 --> 00:26:16.301]  So there's that.
[00:26:17.922 --> 00:26:20.483]  I don't know whether I should just write it up when I get taken off the air.
[00:26:20.563 --> 00:26:23.244]  Just go run and set up something else under somebody else immediately.
[00:26:23.264 --> 00:26:25.305]  I don't know.
[00:26:25.385 --> 00:26:26.926]  All these great folks are offering me jobs.
[00:26:26.946 --> 00:26:27.886]  I don't know who I would go with.
[00:26:29.287 --> 00:26:35.755]   And I don't know if I should only worry about that or keep doing the show every day.
[00:26:35.775 --> 00:26:38.316]  I mean, there's a lot there.
[00:26:38.376 --> 00:26:41.258]  Just follow me on Real Alex Jones and I really appreciate you.
[00:26:41.298 --> 00:26:44.759]  But this is bigger than Alex Jones and them fours and my crew that's really getting hurt here.
[00:26:44.819 --> 00:26:45.619]  They're the real victims.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.021]  And everybody's right to see what they want to see and listen to what they want to hear.
[00:26:49.041 --> 00:26:50.141]  It's that they're coming after everybody.
[00:26:50.161 --> 00:26:52.102]  Like Trump always says, they're trying to get through me to get to you.
[00:26:53.002 --> 00:26:57.984]  And that's really the big takeaway here is they have to get through people that stand up to get to you.
[00:26:58.004 --> 00:27:01.526]  And they're standing up against the leaders who try to intimidate us so nobody else will stand up.
[00:27:03.226 --> 00:27:09.751]  It's a message to people they think are cowards, but I think people understand that the price of laying down is much worse than the price of standing up.
[00:27:10.291 --> 00:27:11.532]  And so that's why I decided to stand up.
[00:27:11.552 --> 00:27:12.693]  And I think you'll join me.
[00:27:12.913 --> 00:27:15.855]  The globalists thought you were cowards when you were asleep, when America was asleep.
[00:27:16.395 --> 00:27:18.536]  That's why they were bullying you and attacking and intimidating you.
[00:27:19.177 --> 00:27:21.919]  Most people were asleep and said they didn't know what was going on or didn't understand it or were naive.
[00:27:22.519 --> 00:27:23.980]  Now the intimidation is not working.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.782]  People are getting angry, they're getting focused, and they're standing up.
[00:27:26.842 --> 00:27:33.111]   So we're in a moment We're in a massive moment of decision for humanity and the whole world, not just America right now.
[00:27:33.132 --> 00:27:34.433]  Are we going to let tyrants rule over us?
[00:27:34.453 --> 00:27:41.119]  Or are we going to stand up and reverse this tyrannical course we're on and retake our civilization and our nations?
[00:27:41.159 --> 00:27:43.842]  Our children deserve it with the incredible medical tyranny.
[00:27:44.301 --> 00:27:46.784]  And the social tyranny and just the attack on the family.
[00:27:47.304 --> 00:27:51.870]  We have a right and a duty to stand up against this because at the end of the day, it's not the globalists that are at fault.
[00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:52.410]  They're evil.
[00:27:52.771 --> 00:27:53.331]  They're sharks.
[00:27:53.351 --> 00:27:54.072]  They're inherently bad.
[00:27:54.092 --> 00:27:54.573]  They're predators.
[00:27:54.593 --> 00:27:55.173]  They're going to attack.
[00:27:55.574 --> 00:28:00.920]  It's up to us that have laid down to stand up or we become complicit in our own destruction and God will not forgive us.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:02.021]  God bless you all.
[00:28:02.581 --> 00:28:05.301]   We're still on the air right now and in full words.com port slash show and man
[00:28:05.301 --> 00:28:08.260]   not video and real Alex Jones, the radio stations across the country.
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.661]  I want to thank all those great stations.
[00:28:09.661 --> 00:28:13.621]   And I just hope that you'll take this time to realize we're at the crossroads
[00:28:13.621 --> 00:28:15.621]  for humanity, not just America.
[00:28:15.621 --> 00:28:16.340]  God bless.
[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:17.381]  And I thank you all for your support.
[00:28:17.381 --> 00:28:17.940]  Never forget.
[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:21.701]   If you're watching this transmission or listening to it, you are the resistance.
[00:28:21.701 --> 00:28:23.661]  I don't know what I do.
[00:28:23.661 --> 00:28:25.341]  I saw Fauci walking down the street or Bill Gates.
[00:28:25.417 --> 00:28:28.139]  I mean, he's so outrageously evil.
[00:28:28.579 --> 00:28:30.060]  He's such a murderer!
[00:28:30.521 --> 00:28:36.145]  And we need to have... You're a Christian, you're a father, you're a theologian, you're able to be really calm and nice about this.
[00:28:36.185 --> 00:28:39.607]  I know you're pissed off about it, but... The thing is, take action, folks.
[00:28:39.667 --> 00:28:40.328]  Resist them.
[00:28:40.648 --> 00:28:41.809]  Protect yourself from them.
[00:28:41.929 --> 00:28:42.670]  Expose them.
[00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:46.813]  What do we do biblically, do you think, to just spiritually be able to deal with this?
[00:28:47.881 --> 00:28:50.263]  Well, we can't deal with stuff like this on our own.
[00:28:51.164 --> 00:28:53.966]  You have to lean on God.
[00:28:54.686 --> 00:28:55.227]  You have to.
[00:28:55.287 --> 00:28:59.490]  Because when you look at what He is, He knows the beginning from the end.
[00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:01.492]  He knows everything that we're going through.
[00:29:02.092 --> 00:29:04.894]  In the midst of the storm, He brings peace.
[00:29:05.595 --> 00:29:08.277]  We know how this game ends.
[00:29:08.897 --> 00:29:10.138]  And we know who wins.
[00:29:11.019 --> 00:29:11.199]  Right?
[00:29:11.319 --> 00:29:13.740]  And the Bible tells us every knee must bow.
[00:29:14.101 --> 00:29:17.662]  The knee of sickness, the knee of disease, the knee of all these things that we're seeing.
[00:29:18.162 --> 00:29:20.504]  And we know what happens to the devil.
[00:29:20.924 --> 00:29:22.565]  Jesus throws him in the pit.
[00:29:23.305 --> 00:29:23.545]  Right?
[00:29:23.705 --> 00:29:25.966]  And so we know who wins this.
[00:29:26.066 --> 00:29:27.047]  But here's the thing.
[00:29:27.947 --> 00:29:31.049]  God never told us that this life was going to be easy.
[00:29:31.689 --> 00:29:32.570]  He never told us.
[00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:34.351]  In fact, He told us the opposite.
[00:29:34.951 --> 00:29:38.153]  He said, Jesus said, you know, take up your cross and follow me.
[00:29:38.613 --> 00:29:41.915]  People are going to oppose you for following me.
[00:29:42.416 --> 00:29:43.036]  But you know what?
[00:29:43.196 --> 00:29:48.099]  The end result is going to be better if you follow me than if you don't.
[00:29:48.579 --> 00:30:07.337]   Right, so look at the opposition, take the opposition, but never deviate from that path of following truth and following victory and that strength of God who created the universe, who put All of His creativity in us because we were created in His image.
[00:30:07.717 --> 00:30:28.881]  We have to realize we've got that power of God pulsating through our veins every single day because we're created in His image and when we do that we can have confidence that like what Psalms tells us and we can rest under the shadow of His wings that the enemy will come near our tent but they can't come into it, right?
[00:30:29.341 --> 00:30:30.141]  Look at the enemy.
[00:30:30.502 --> 00:30:31.402]  They're all slaves.
[00:30:31.482 --> 00:30:32.683]  Satan always destroys them.
[00:30:32.723 --> 00:30:34.744]  Even before they die, we see them betrayed.
[00:30:35.084 --> 00:30:36.004]  We see them destroyed.
[00:30:36.044 --> 00:30:44.788]  And we see billions and billions of dollars spent by the federal government secretly, with just Walgreens and CVS alone, to not prescribe ivermectin.
[00:30:45.169 --> 00:30:49.891]  So all this evil, you wonder, why are they not giving people the drugs that they now admit works?
[00:30:50.251 --> 00:30:51.472]  Because they wanted to hurt people.
[00:30:51.512 --> 00:30:52.472]  They wanted people fearful.
[00:30:52.752 --> 00:30:58.035]  But it took billions to buy them off to do the evil, and the devil has the control of the purse.
[00:30:58.875 --> 00:31:00.818]  He has the power of the earth right now.
[00:31:00.858 --> 00:31:02.261]  He's the god of this world right now.
[00:31:02.481 --> 00:31:09.672]  But it shows every bit of it is mercenaries working against their own self-interest for a little bit of money.
[00:31:11.169 --> 00:31:12.430]  Our firm is just different.
[00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:16.793]  We charge 8% when you purchase, 0% when you liquidate.
[00:31:17.153 --> 00:31:23.137]  We buy directly from the depository in Shiner, Texas, the Texas Precious Metals Depository.
[00:31:23.557 --> 00:31:28.040]  So their wholesale prices, you tack on 8%, they ship it directly to you.
[00:31:28.481 --> 00:31:32.603]   When you sell it back, we take nothing Zero.
[00:31:33.084 --> 00:31:35.705]  And whatever the depository prices are, you get all of it.
[00:31:36.145 --> 00:31:49.611]  See, that's a huge difference from buying a rare coin, something that has a high commission, high premium, where even after the big move in silver that we've seen, you still haven't even broken even.

[00:32:12.538 --> 00:32:22.538]  [SFX]
[00:32:22.538 --> 00:32:24.538]   This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:32:25.287 --> 00:32:25.327]  U.S.
[00:32:25.688 --> 00:32:33.956]  resistance against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[00:32:34.416 --> 00:32:36.918]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[00:32:36.938 --> 00:32:38.400]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.642]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[00:32:40.902 --> 00:32:42.983]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[00:32:43.223 --> 00:32:44.303]  This is all confirmed.
[00:32:44.323 --> 00:32:45.283]  This is not a drill.
[00:32:45.423 --> 00:32:49.364]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[00:32:49.685 --> 00:32:51.105]  They've officially become state-run.
[00:32:51.225 --> 00:32:51.705]  Apple 100%.
[00:32:52.105 --> 00:32:57.727]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[00:32:58.187 --> 00:33:02.950]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:04.110]  This is happening.
[00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:12.054]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[00:33:12.154 --> 00:33:18.097]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[00:33:18.518 --> 00:33:26.482]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion, paradigm manipulation.
[00:33:27.362 --> 00:33:30.906]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[00:33:31.206 --> 00:33:34.389]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[00:33:34.709 --> 00:33:41.696]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[00:33:41.956 --> 00:33:44.619]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[00:33:44.939 --> 00:33:49.764]  Total Internet of Things integration, global social score, complete command and control system.
[00:33:50.204 --> 00:33:52.106]  It is the virtual reality A.I.
[00:33:52.146 --> 00:34:05.899]  weapon system now attacking the United States with traitors inside the major security agencies, blocking Trump's resistance of the program and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles of the Chai Com slash Big Tech banking combine emergency situation.
[00:34:06.199 --> 00:34:11.384]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[00:34:12.481 --> 00:34:21.183]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[00:34:21.223 --> 00:34:26.104]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[00:34:26.484 --> 00:34:29.585]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars.
[00:34:29.805 --> 00:34:31.405]  And so they make me a herder of children.
[00:34:31.765 --> 00:34:38.947]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[00:34:39.907 --> 00:34:46.653]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[00:34:47.093 --> 00:34:52.457]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and is being used against you.
[00:34:52.677 --> 00:34:57.401]  Only your full understanding of this TE will break you free from this paradigm.
[00:34:57.601 --> 00:34:59.503]  I have given you the transmission!
[00:34:59.643 --> 00:35:00.664]  Now break free!
[00:35:04.267 --> 00:35:12.971]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:35:13.812 --> 00:35:16.253]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:35:16.373 --> 00:35:20.315]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:35:22.496 --> 00:35:25.997]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[00:35:26.398 --> 00:35:33.361]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of, is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[00:35:33.581 --> 00:35:35.581]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[00:35:35.761 --> 00:35:36.822]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[00:35:36.862 --> 00:35:37.602]  He loved the idea.
[00:35:37.902 --> 00:35:41.403]  What would you call the debate and discussion about a pro-human future?
[00:35:41.443 --> 00:35:42.323]  Just Team Humanity?
[00:35:42.363 --> 00:35:43.263]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[00:35:43.403 --> 00:35:43.843]  Absolutely.
[00:35:44.183 --> 00:35:45.544]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[00:35:45.624 --> 00:35:49.044]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[00:35:49.305 --> 00:35:56.746]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to keep InfoWars on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[00:35:57.006 --> 00:36:00.047]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now.
[00:36:00.367 --> 00:36:08.734]  To understand that this is a revolution against the globalists and it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[00:36:09.014 --> 00:36:10.336]  We're told humans are the problem.
[00:36:10.356 --> 00:36:11.356]  We're told we're killing the earth.
[00:36:11.637 --> 00:36:15.900]  We're told all this garbage so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[00:36:16.201 --> 00:36:16.901]  We're not going to do that.
[00:36:17.162 --> 00:36:21.806]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at mfullworthstore.com and I thank you all for your support.
