[00:00:59.-200 --> 00:00:13.760]  It's Thursday, June 13th, 2024.
[00:00:13.977 --> 00:00:16.478]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from the InfoWars studios.
[00:00:17.018 --> 00:00:20.018]  We could be shut down as early as tomorrow, the 14th.
[00:00:20.078 --> 00:00:22.159]  I'm in court, federal court, in Houston.
[00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:32.482]  But today, Owen is hosting the show out of the other studio because I'm about, in just a few minutes, to be interviewing Terry Carlson for two hours and then Russell Brand today.
[00:00:32.542 --> 00:00:35.443]  Because we could be shut down any time, we're not going to wait on these interviews.
[00:00:35.463 --> 00:00:40.485]   We're going to post them both Tonight at RealAlexJones on X and at InfoWars.com.
[00:00:40.925 --> 00:00:47.128]  But InfoWars will be shut down literally within just a few days, if not hours, starting tomorrow.
[00:00:47.488 --> 00:00:52.711]  So be sure and follow me at RealAlexJones on X. But I'm about to interview Tucker in a wide-ranging, in-depth interview.
[00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:58.614]  His last interview with Joe Rogan, another fellow Austinite and good friend of mine, was explosive and incredible.
[00:00:59.074 --> 00:01:02.156]  I'm going to ask some of the same questions but elaborate on a lot of other questions that were not asked.
[00:01:02.476 --> 00:01:06.998]   I've got over 50 questions I've written right over there ready For Tucker.
[00:01:07.278 --> 00:01:13.501]  So I'm going to be sitting right here at this desk interviewing the number one media personality when it comes to Liberty in the world.
[00:01:14.301 --> 00:01:15.982]  The whole corporate media is collapsing and dying.
[00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:17.242]  This is historic what's happening.
[00:01:17.603 --> 00:01:21.784]  So be sure and join Owen today on this Thursday edition 11 a.m.
[00:01:22.164 --> 00:01:22.825]  to 3 p.m.
[00:01:22.865 --> 00:01:23.245]  Central.
[00:01:23.285 --> 00:01:24.665]  He's hosting the show, doing a great job.
[00:01:25.486 --> 00:01:30.588]  And then tomorrow we're going to air the full interviews with Tucker Carlson.
[00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:36.632]  And, of course, Russell Brand, two amazing individuals for the pro-human Team Humanity movement.
[00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:40.095]  So we'll put out about 90% of the interviews today.
[00:01:40.135 --> 00:01:44.599]  We'll have some extra stuff that is only on the show tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.080]  Central, 12 noon Eastern.
[00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.940]  So that's it.
[00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:48.442]  What a way to go out.
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.382]  I don't think the judge will shut us down right away tomorrow, but that's basically where this is going.
[00:01:53.402 --> 00:01:55.844]  He'll probably announce when we're going to be shut down tomorrow.
[00:01:55.864 --> 00:02:00.947]  So I'll have more details for you by about 3 o'clock tomorrow, right when the show ends.
[00:02:01.147 --> 00:02:03.529]  There'll be a tape show with Tucker and Russell Brand.
[00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:08.372]  I should have the details for you, and we'll be calling in to the War Room that Owen hosts, 3 p.m.
[00:02:08.412 --> 00:02:08.632]  Central.
[00:02:08.652 --> 00:02:10.593]  So be sure to follow me at RealAlexJones.
[00:02:10.893 --> 00:02:12.034]  This is going to be a huge interview.
[00:02:12.114 --> 00:02:12.915]  It's all free to air.
[00:02:12.995 --> 00:02:14.876]  Take clips, share it, do whatever you want.
[00:02:15.496 --> 00:02:20.538]  And at the same time, please support our sponsor drjonesnaturals.com that's separate from InfoWars.
[00:02:20.618 --> 00:02:22.759]  So no matter what happens here, you continue to support us.
[00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:28.302]  They're great supplements and great nano silver products and so much more at drjonesnaturals.com and follow us again at Relox Jones.
[00:02:28.322 --> 00:02:29.562]  I want to thank Tiger for coming on.
[00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:32.984]  I'm also going to be going on the road with him coming up in September and October.
[00:02:33.024 --> 00:02:41.986]   Huge events across the country that I'm very honored to be a part of and so more dates and information are going to be announced imminently, probably by tomorrow. So be sure to go to Tucker Carlson dot com and get your tickets
[00:02:41.986 --> 00:02:50.386]   now because these will sell out. It's like Trump rallies. It's going to be crazy. I'm just so honored to be part of the second American Revolution, 1776 worldwide. So God bless and
[00:02:50.386 --> 00:03:00.546]   good luck. And we'll see you. While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:03:07.106 --> 00:03:10.466]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's get my studio all ready here.
[00:03:10.466 --> 00:03:20.466]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:03:11.714 --> 00:03:16.197]  Little clunky transitioning out of the same studio that Harrison Smith was in.
[00:03:16.237 --> 00:03:26.105]  But as Alex was explaining, he's in the main studio right now doing interviews with Tucker Carlson and Russell Brand.
[00:03:26.165 --> 00:03:28.908]  So very much looking forward to that.
[00:03:29.468 --> 00:03:36.520]   And I guess in the 90 seconds that we have left here, I don't know.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.301]  Is he pointing at me?
[00:03:37.461 --> 00:03:38.662]  I don't know.
[00:03:39.362 --> 00:03:39.743]  Okay.
[00:03:41.064 --> 00:03:44.266]  I love coming out of the studio that just finishes up a broadcast.
[00:03:44.306 --> 00:03:45.387]  It's my favorite thing in media.
[00:03:45.908 --> 00:03:46.228]  All right.
[00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:49.911]  So I guess in the 60 seconds, we'll fix it in the break, guys.
[00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:50.271]  It's all right.
[00:03:50.311 --> 00:03:51.632]  I can't even see myself on the screen.
[00:03:51.752 --> 00:03:52.693]  So it's not a big deal.
[00:03:54.654 --> 00:04:02.901]  I have probably hosted the Alex Jones Show hundreds of times since I joined InfoWars in 2016.
[00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:09.634]  And today is likely the last time.
[00:04:11.054 --> 00:04:13.395]  Maybe there'll be another opportunity for me.
[00:04:14.436 --> 00:04:34.600]   But I have to say, it really is an incredible story and I would use it as an inspirational tool that when I was coming up in media, And made the switch from sports to politics, and the Alex Jones Show was my favorite show.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.322]  Hosting the Alex Jones Show was a dream of mine.
[00:04:37.342 --> 00:04:42.085]  It was something that I wanted to reach for and accomplish, and I did it.
[00:04:42.645 --> 00:04:44.247]  It was in my wildest dreams.
[00:04:44.927 --> 00:04:47.909]  But I worked hard, I focused on it, and I did it.
[00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.892]  And so you really can, you really can accomplish your dreams.
[00:04:51.912 --> 00:04:55.875]  It's not easy, it takes hard work and dedication, but you can do it.
[00:04:56.575 --> 00:04:57.616]  Nothing is impossible.
[00:05:01.164 --> 00:05:05.925]  If you don't get a high-quality gravity-fed filter from InfoWarsTore.com, please just get one.
[00:05:06.345 --> 00:05:10.066]  Now, we sell a unit, stainless steel, that is the highest rated out there.
[00:05:10.426 --> 00:05:12.387]  There's a couple of competitors that are just as good.
[00:05:12.407 --> 00:05:14.307]  There's a hundred others that aren't as good.
[00:05:14.327 --> 00:05:21.489]  It is the best system out there to take thousands of chemicals and compounds down to non-detectable levels.
[00:05:21.829 --> 00:05:24.732]  The tap water, the well water, it is a witch's brew.
[00:05:25.193 --> 00:05:32.281]  And right now at InfoWarsStore.com, we have a special on the Alexa Pure Gravity Fed Water Filtration System for 10% off.
[00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:37.327]  That's huge because there's not much markup in these because we sell them so close to cost.
[00:05:37.707 --> 00:05:45.349]   So get your Alexa Pure water filtration systems and so much more at InfoWareStore.com, but whatever you do,

[00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:26.429]   Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones and now your host Owen Troyer.
[00:06:26.429 --> 00:06:49.109]  [Music]
[00:06:49.145 --> 00:06:52.326]  Can I just soak it in here?
[00:06:52.366 --> 00:06:57.568]  Have the crew soak it in.
[00:06:57.888 --> 00:07:09.811]  We could be in the final hours of InfoWars.
[00:07:09.851 --> 00:07:17.834]  We could be in the final days of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:19.714 --> 00:07:21.255]  I'm not going to spend too much time on that.
[00:07:22.396 --> 00:07:30.860]  Alex did a bit of a briefing in the opening segment to tell you what to expect in the upcoming days.
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.741]  So I'm not going to spend a bunch of time on that.
[00:07:33.261 --> 00:07:36.943]  In fact, I'm really excited to cover the news today, to be quite frank with you.
[00:07:37.043 --> 00:07:38.364]  So that's what we're going to do.
[00:07:38.484 --> 00:07:41.365]  And I got a ton of news and I got a ton of video clips.
[00:07:41.765 --> 00:07:42.646]  That's what I want to do.
[00:07:42.866 --> 00:07:43.806]  That's what I like to do.
[00:07:44.727 --> 00:07:46.488]  And that's what we're going to do.
[00:07:49.666 --> 00:07:51.927]  It's hard to kind of ignore that elephant in the room.
[00:07:54.268 --> 00:07:58.370]  It's hard to not feel that.
[00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:59.150]  That presence.
[00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.451]  Knowing that we're basically in the final countdown.
[00:08:03.492 --> 00:08:05.932]  The future is, in a way, uncertain.
[00:08:07.773 --> 00:08:08.874]  But let's just leave it at that.
[00:08:09.154 --> 00:08:11.295]  Just big ups to the audience, big ups to the crew.
[00:08:12.655 --> 00:08:13.916]  Legendary stuff we've done.
[00:08:14.836 --> 00:08:17.297]  That's the crew, that's the audience, that's our guests.
[00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:23.021]  Legendary stuff has taken place right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:23.202 --> 00:08:26.324]  Now, let me tell you what we got coming up for you today.
[00:08:28.406 --> 00:08:36.052]  Joe Biden cannot make a public appearance without being a complete disaster.
[00:08:38.133 --> 00:08:43.197]  I don't know the last time he made a public appearance that wasn't a complete embarrassment.
[00:08:44.018 --> 00:09:12.811]   Whether it's speaking at an event, Whether it's just walking off of an airplane whether it's walking off of a stage Now he's arrived in Italy For the g7 summit and it's the same thing can't even walk after getting off an airplane doesn't even know where he is He gets confused yesterday With Chuck Schumer after he shakes his hand and then he goes back for the second handshake like he forgot He just shook his hand
[00:09:14.258 --> 00:09:20.801]  Roaming around, he's saluting members of the European Parliament, saluting them instead of shaking their hand.
[00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:24.002]  It's just one awkward thing after the other.
[00:09:25.723 --> 00:09:28.964]  And then there's also the presence of Zelensky, so we'll get into all of that.
[00:09:30.425 --> 00:09:48.772]   Now, while Biden is in Italy, the irony of Joe Biden speaking at a gun safety event the same day that Hunter Biden gets charged on three counts of gun safety violations, it gets even more ironic now.
[00:09:50.413 --> 00:10:00.757]  As Hunter Biden, and look, rightfully so, and it's funny that Donald Trump says, I'll pardon Hunter Biden essentially because he has a Second Amendment right like everybody else.
[00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:06.640]  Hunter Biden is going to be appealing these charges.
[00:10:08.956 --> 00:10:26.236]  To be a little more detailed here, Hunter Biden is going to be appealing the charges under the constitutional argument that the laws that the Democrats and Joe Biden himself have written and passed are unconstitutional.
[00:10:28.444 --> 00:10:36.249]  So Joe Biden is out here campaigning on gun safety, campaigning for these different gun laws and gun legislation that he wants to pass.
[00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:41.553]  And Hunter is appealing all of it so that he can get his charges dropped.
[00:10:44.175 --> 00:10:44.775]  That's fun.
[00:10:46.216 --> 00:10:52.780]  And then it's just, you know, more comes out about the dealings and the activities of Hunter Biden.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:58.064]  It's like, look, I don't want to know about Hunter Biden's perverted sex life.
[00:11:01.109 --> 00:11:05.171]  But I mean, is it fair to say that it's relevant?
[00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:14.035]  Is it fair to say that they want to sit here and attack the Trump family and attack Don Jr.
[00:11:14.155 --> 00:11:17.997]  and Eric and they'll do anything they can to make them look bad.
[00:11:18.197 --> 00:11:26.982]  And then here's Hunter Biden with some of the most sordid, disgusting, filthy, perverted activities that you could ever imagine.
[00:11:30.452 --> 00:11:35.315]  The gun conviction is one thing, watching him appeal it against his own dad's legislation is another thing.
[00:11:37.657 --> 00:11:55.669]  What's going to be interesting is what happens in September when Hunter Biden is going to be in court in California for tax evasion, and then in the actual government filings in the court documents, it talks about how he was a lobbyist, which of course means that he's violating FARA regulations.
[00:11:55.709 --> 00:11:57.270]  He was never a registered foreign agent.
[00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:59.231]  He was bringing in millions of dollars.
[00:12:00.933 --> 00:12:10.436]  But there's another name that kind of escapes all of this, and that name is Barack Obama.
[00:12:12.136 --> 00:12:22.459]  Because as Hunter Biden and Joe Biden are doing this illegal lobbying and pay-for-play scams, while Joe Biden is Vice President, well Barack Obama was President.
[00:12:22.799 --> 00:12:25.140]  What role was Barack Obama serving in all of this?
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:35.146]   So how are they going to try to sweep this under the rug When this gets into the court in September, how are they going to sweep this under the rug?
[00:12:36.587 --> 00:12:38.248]  Because that's the real disaster here.
[00:12:38.608 --> 00:12:55.277]  Hunter Biden being addicted to drugs and brandishing firearms on videos and tossing them into dumpsters and lying on government documents and all this other stuff is... I mean, it's really irrelevant, except it's just, you know, it's just, okay, it's the president's son and he's going against their own legislation.
[00:12:55.397 --> 00:12:59.419]  But no, what happens in the California court is going to be more important.
[00:13:00.839 --> 00:13:14.510]  The illegal, well, he was avoiding taxes, but the illegal lobbying that Hunter Biden was doing for Joe Biden, James Biden was doing for Joe Biden, what did Barack Obama know?
[00:13:15.551 --> 00:13:17.432]  And how many shell corporations were there?
[00:13:17.452 --> 00:13:21.376]  We know there were almost 200 shell corporations, but we'll kind of get back to that.
[00:13:21.416 --> 00:13:30.243]  Now, meanwhile, Joe Biden is continuing his campaign and it's just, they have nothing to go off of.
[00:13:32.176 --> 00:13:33.697]  They're campaigning on abortion.
[00:13:35.559 --> 00:13:38.101]  They're campaigning on January 6th.
[00:13:39.862 --> 00:13:49.791]  And I'm wondering if they didn't put out this ad this morning, a Biden ad, telling you how bad Trump is because of January 6th.
[00:13:50.551 --> 00:13:58.318]  I'm wondering if that wasn't in response to the Pelosi tape that just came out, where she's on this video basically saying that it's her fault.
[00:13:59.574 --> 00:14:01.115]  That January 6th happened.
[00:14:01.275 --> 00:14:08.300]  And, you know, it's an interesting phenomenon because it makes it sound like Pelosi didn't really know what was going on.
[00:14:09.701 --> 00:14:14.604]  And, of course, to some extent she knew what was going on because she had the documentary film crew there.
[00:14:16.465 --> 00:14:32.052]   But it does kind of open this new line of questioning into that day to say, well, if Pelosi was actually, let's say Pelosi was genuinely shocked That they stormed the Capitol that day.
[00:14:32.152 --> 00:14:38.154]  Let's say that that was an actual, she wasn't just playing for the cameras or had it scripted or whatever.
[00:14:38.835 --> 00:14:43.637]  Let's say that was an actual response that she was stunned that there was the storming of the Capitol that day.
[00:14:44.617 --> 00:14:45.217]  Well, okay.
[00:14:46.298 --> 00:14:51.912]   Why then, it still begs the question, Except maybe there's a different answer now.
[00:14:52.092 --> 00:14:54.353]  Why then did she and the D.C.
[00:14:54.393 --> 00:14:55.933]  Mayor stand down the D.C.
[00:14:56.053 --> 00:14:59.374]  Capitol Police and the National Guard when it was being requested?
[00:15:01.134 --> 00:15:01.435]  Why?
[00:15:04.395 --> 00:15:06.296]  So maybe there's another angle to that.
[00:15:07.476 --> 00:15:09.657]  If it wasn't just... And who knows?
[00:15:09.857 --> 00:15:11.317]  They all could have been running different things.
[00:15:11.337 --> 00:15:15.238]  You could have had Milley and the Deep State running their own thing on January 6th.
[00:15:15.538 --> 00:15:19.339]  You could have had the Democrats with Pelosi and Bowser running their own thing on January 6th.
[00:15:20.496 --> 00:15:29.900]  And they shared a common goal, which was make Trump look bad, make Trump supporters look bad, and sabotage Donald Trump.
[00:15:31.161 --> 00:15:32.121]  So that doesn't change.
[00:15:33.602 --> 00:15:42.865]  But do you think Joe Biden releases a January 6th campaign ad to kind of re-put the focus on Trump as the Pelosi tapes come out?
[00:15:42.926 --> 00:15:48.588]  Where she's like, yeah, we stood down the police that day and now it's kind of my fault.
[00:15:50.445 --> 00:15:51.626]  Because we didn't expect this.
[00:15:55.647 --> 00:15:59.949]  So then, you didn't expect it, but Trump did.
[00:16:04.671 --> 00:16:07.171]  Okay, sorry. I just got something in my ear here, guys.
[00:16:07.171 --> 00:16:14.011]  Yes, but can I get that out of my ear, please?
[00:16:14.011 --> 00:16:24.011]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:16:15.134 --> 00:16:15.414]  Thank you.
[00:16:15.714 --> 00:16:15.974]  Okay.
[00:16:16.935 --> 00:16:17.195]  Sorry.
[00:16:17.855 --> 00:16:20.095]  Just some technical snafus switching studios here.
[00:16:20.155 --> 00:16:22.116]  Anyway, we're skipping the breaks, so that's what that's all about.
[00:16:23.396 --> 00:16:26.097]  So we'll show you this new campaign ad, but it's the typical lies.
[00:16:27.258 --> 00:16:28.418]  Oh, Trump's responsible.
[00:16:28.618 --> 00:16:29.998]  Oh, they attacked the police.
[00:16:31.539 --> 00:16:37.461]  They did remove the police dying from this one, so I guess they figured that the propaganda ran out there.
[00:16:38.021 --> 00:16:46.830]   We have some news out of the Supreme Court, just some straight-up political news, and then also They have a judiciary meeting about something that doesn't exist.
[00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:50.334]  And this is all about the abortion deal, how the Democrats are running on abortion.
[00:16:52.135 --> 00:16:54.958]  And they have a hearing today on something that doesn't exist.
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:06.830]  As Senator Mike Lee puts it, and we'll play the tape, but they have a hearing today on laws that don't exist.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:11.542]  Prohibiting women from traveling from one state to another to get an abortion.
[00:17:11.863 --> 00:17:13.324]  There are no laws on the books.
[00:17:14.805 --> 00:17:17.286]  As of today, there are no proposed laws.
[00:17:17.326 --> 00:17:18.908]  There is no proposed legislation.
[00:17:19.488 --> 00:17:21.149]  It's a made-up concept.
[00:17:21.689 --> 00:17:27.093]  It's kind of like the same thing where they said Republicans want to ban abortion pills.
[00:17:27.474 --> 00:17:31.616]  Well, the Supreme Court just passed unanimously that abortion pills are legal.
[00:17:33.117 --> 00:17:39.729]   So they put all these straw men out there And it's about abortion.
[00:17:40.049 --> 00:17:45.110]  But see, this goes back to this ad that we'll show you, this other Democrat Party paid for propaganda ad.
[00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:54.152]  And they try to pretend like it's organic by hiring these young kids to speak in front of their cell phones, but it's all Democrat Party propaganda.
[00:17:56.233 --> 00:18:08.507]   And they're saying, how can you be a young man How can you be a young man and vote Republican because don't you know if you have a girlfriend or a wife that now they can't get an abortion?
[00:18:10.349 --> 00:18:10.589]  What?
[00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:18.193]  Your pitch is, your angle to young men is that don't you want your wife or girlfriend to kill your offspring?
[00:18:19.694 --> 00:18:26.218]  I mean, that's about as twisted as it gets.
[00:18:27.399 --> 00:18:43.468]  That is about as twisted of a worldview, that is about as demonic as a worldview as it gets, saying young men should vote Democrat so that your wife, your girlfriend, whatever the case is, can kill your offspring.
[00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:48.191]  Because that's what young men are thinking about.
[00:18:50.472 --> 00:18:51.693]  We want to kill our kids.
[00:18:52.393 --> 00:18:55.215]  I guess if you're a liberal maybe, but I don't even buy that.
[00:18:56.693 --> 00:19:01.516]  That is a full-on leftist, psychotic, feminoid thing.
[00:19:02.937 --> 00:19:05.478]  This weird lust and desire to kill your baby.
[00:19:06.258 --> 00:19:12.822]  But it's such a fringe thing, they just make a bigger deal out of it, hoping they can get these single-issue voters to vote Democrat is really all it's about.
[00:19:13.963 --> 00:19:17.525]  Then there was a decision in Michigan that's kind of being debated.
[00:19:17.645 --> 00:19:20.366]  The Democrats are celebrating it and the Republicans are celebrating it.
[00:19:21.447 --> 00:19:34.796]   I'll try to make sense of it, but essentially what it confirms Is that in the 2020 election there was no voter signature verification on mail-in ballots and absentee ballots.
[00:19:35.416 --> 00:19:37.117]  And so that's basically what they've confirmed.
[00:19:37.717 --> 00:19:40.058]  But we'll get into more of that coming up as well.
[00:19:41.499 --> 00:20:02.678]   And then there's a bill in Florida to ban Some of the ingredients in foods that are extremely toxic and there's been this trend where you can look at popular food products or popular restaurants, fast food restaurants, and the ingredients in America are different than the ingredients in Europe.
[00:20:04.219 --> 00:20:15.188]   And so Europeans Don't put a lot of the toxic food dyes and additives and stuff in their foods that we put here in America.
[00:20:16.249 --> 00:20:19.912]  And so this is kind of a revolutionary proposal, actually.
[00:20:20.732 --> 00:20:22.593]  So we'll talk about that as well.
[00:20:22.974 --> 00:20:24.415]  We do have some geopolitical news.
[00:20:25.415 --> 00:20:26.656]  It's almost crazy.
[00:20:26.896 --> 00:20:29.498]  I feel like I'm playing Age of Empires 2 or something.
[00:20:30.919 --> 00:20:39.789]   Israel has brought out trebuchets And are firing fireballs into Lebanon.
[00:20:42.331 --> 00:20:43.913]  And we have the footage of it.
[00:20:44.213 --> 00:20:45.975]  This is insane, but okay.
[00:20:46.735 --> 00:20:48.097]  They're going full medieval now.
[00:20:49.037 --> 00:20:49.838]  That's pretty wild.
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:21:00.747]   And then Hungary gets a victory for nationalism, but then also is being attacked because they won't Take any migrants.
[00:21:01.547 --> 00:21:04.769]  So they don't want to be involved in the Ukraine war and they don't want any migrants.
[00:21:05.169 --> 00:21:06.490]  So now they're going to be fined.
[00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:10.972]  So now they're going to be fined for that is what we're going to have happen there.
[00:21:11.612 --> 00:21:12.933]  So that's what we got coming up.
[00:21:13.113 --> 00:21:15.814]  And I got a ton of video clips here to bring it all together.
[00:21:16.995 --> 00:21:17.815]  But I'll tell you what.
[00:21:19.776 --> 00:21:26.200]  In a bit of a fun vein here, there was the congressional baseball game last night.
[00:21:27.279 --> 00:21:32.782]  And there were some extracurriculars as some pro-Palestine protesters tried to run on the field.
[00:21:32.802 --> 00:21:33.623]  Well, they did run on the field.
[00:21:34.043 --> 00:21:34.823]  They didn't get far.
[00:21:34.863 --> 00:21:37.445]  And it really just shows you the lack of energy from the left.
[00:21:38.565 --> 00:21:47.030]  Because this was probably the worst I've ever seen of somebody running on the field to make a statement or get a funny video or whatever the cause.
[00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:52.753]  This is basically the most ineffective run-on-the-field stunt that I've ever seen.
[00:21:52.773 --> 00:21:55.935]  So let's look at some of this footage.
[00:21:57.642 --> 00:22:04.644]  They basically get like two steps onto the baseball field and it's like they can't even run.
[00:22:05.004 --> 00:22:10.666]  It's really an odd thing to see this in clip 19.
[00:22:11.346 --> 00:22:12.947]  We just go ahead and put that on the screen.
[00:22:16.468 --> 00:22:20.569]  So they don't even make it about 20 feet before they get shut down.
[00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:27.251]  So I don't know if this video has all the angles.
[00:22:29.158 --> 00:22:31.799]  But there were definitely other angles and other close-ups, too.
[00:22:34.521 --> 00:22:35.261]  Yeah.
[00:22:35.321 --> 00:22:36.002]  So here's another one.
[00:22:36.022 --> 00:22:37.903]  You can really see the lack of energy.
[00:22:38.223 --> 00:22:40.985]  These people get brought down before they... Look at this guy.
[00:22:41.025 --> 00:22:42.465]  I mean, nice effort, man.
[00:22:45.087 --> 00:22:48.309]  This was the worst run on the field stunt I've ever seen.
[00:22:48.449 --> 00:22:50.890]  Oh, and they have the... Oh, it's the N-Fossil Fuels group, too.
[00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.571]  So they're pro-policy and they're N-Fossil Fuels.
[00:22:52.851 --> 00:22:54.032]  These are obviously leftists.
[00:22:55.273 --> 00:22:57.394]  And worst run on the field stunt I've ever seen.
[00:22:59.022 --> 00:23:00.563]  Absolutely horrible execution.
[00:23:01.464 --> 00:23:03.006]  They barely even made it to the grass.
[00:23:03.846 --> 00:23:13.475]  I give you an F. Well, I guess you got on the field, so maybe we'll give you a D. Maybe we'll give you a D because you did at least get onto the field.
[00:23:15.526 --> 00:23:21.812]  But after that, the lack of energy and enthusiasm, they just waved the white flag.
[00:23:22.152 --> 00:23:23.653]  They just gave up immediately.
[00:23:23.734 --> 00:23:24.754]  There was no effort there.
[00:23:24.855 --> 00:23:27.557]  So, they can't even run on the field right.
[00:23:27.617 --> 00:23:29.018]  They can't even do a protest right.
[00:23:29.239 --> 00:23:31.761]  So, what do you expect?
[00:23:32.822 --> 00:23:46.578]   But, in the last four games, the last four congressional baseball games, The Republicans, they've won four in a row, and they have outscored the Democrats 70-29.
[00:23:46.598 --> 00:23:54.420]  70-29 in the last four years, the Republicans have outscored the Democrats at the Congressional Baseball Game, and I'm not surprised.
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:24:03.664]  You look at what the left is putting up, you look at what the Democrats is putting up, I'm not surprised that there's not much of an athletic ability within the party there.
[00:24:06.124 --> 00:24:14.732]  What I see going on here is this is probably a good representation even of where the country is at politically.
[00:24:14.752 --> 00:24:21.679]  70 to 29, so it's basically 100 scores, let's say, 100 voters.
[00:24:22.259 --> 00:24:29.947]  Probably 70 people out of 100 would prefer to vote Republican than Democrat right now.
[00:24:31.311 --> 00:24:36.332]  So I'd say that's a pretty good representation of even where we're at politically right now.
[00:24:36.392 --> 00:24:38.653]  About 70 to 29 Republicans and Democrats.
[00:24:38.492 --> 00:24:42.992]  But see, but see, what's that?
[00:24:42.992 --> 00:24:52.992]  Uh, I don't really have anything to put there, so it's not a big deal.
[00:24:53.097 --> 00:24:57.098]  This would be the score of the election if things were fair.
[00:24:58.424 --> 00:25:06.150]  But see, in a baseball game, it's a lot harder to rig because you see the run scored right in front of you, you see the guys running around the base pass and touching home plate.
[00:25:07.351 --> 00:25:14.678]  But when we're running an election, they shut down the tabulation centers and they pull out boxes of ballots from under the tables.
[00:25:16.259 --> 00:25:20.462]  At 3.30 in the morning, truckloads of ballots arrive in mail cars.
[00:25:21.769 --> 00:25:26.472]  They lie about a water main break and then triple and quadruple count ballots in Fulton County.
[00:25:27.192 --> 00:25:33.556]  They send their mules out to the voter mail-in drop boxes saying people showing up 20 times.
[00:25:34.096 --> 00:25:37.979]  They block the windows so nobody can see what they're doing inside.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:44.843]  So, I think that the score of the game last night is a good reflection of where America is at right now.
[00:25:44.903 --> 00:25:51.453]   Politically, if the score was counted fairly, If the score was counted fairly.
[00:25:51.493 --> 00:25:59.620]  But of course, more people now, in fact the majority of Americans now, believe that the score was not counted fairly in 2020.
[00:26:01.201 --> 00:26:05.164]  So they try to make it a criminal offense for election denial.
[00:26:06.325 --> 00:26:10.748]  And they cite that in their sentencing memo when they put me in prison for two months.
[00:26:11.168 --> 00:26:16.593]  They said, Schroyer denies the results of 2020's election and he's not even remorseful about it.
[00:26:16.953 --> 00:26:17.974]  So lock him up!
[00:26:18.074 --> 00:26:19.515]  And the judge says, you got it!
[00:26:21.348 --> 00:26:21.949]  You got it!
[00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:40.185]  But I think the trouncing that the Republicans have handed the Democrats in the congressional baseball game is a good metaphor for where we're at politically if things are fair and transparent and counted as they should be.
[00:26:41.747 --> 00:26:44.049]  But I guess that's the big problem, isn't it?
[00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:47.192]  I guess that's the big problem.
[00:26:48.663 --> 00:26:51.025]  People don't trust the election anymore.
[00:26:51.085 --> 00:26:53.046]  And it's such a big story, it's everywhere now.
[00:26:56.469 --> 00:27:03.575]  And, I mean, Russell Brand, who Alex is interviewing with right now, comes out and says there's no way Biden can win unless they cheat.
[00:27:03.715 --> 00:27:08.739]  Joe Rogan, biggest podcast in the world, comes out and says there's no way Biden can win unless they cheat.
[00:27:09.319 --> 00:27:09.480]  Word.
[00:27:10.489 --> 00:27:13.172]  About two weeks away from the first presidential debate.
[00:27:13.513 --> 00:27:18.118]  Joe Biden hasn't had a positive public appearance in weeks, in months.
[00:27:18.339 --> 00:27:19.580]  How are they going to pull this off?
[00:27:20.842 --> 00:27:33.854]   And they have to swear him in digitally in some fake ceremony because of a clerical error and they didn't Have the Democrat convention in time enough to get him on the Ohio ballot.
[00:27:33.874 --> 00:27:42.577]  So even the convention in Chicago is basically just going to be ceremonious because they would have already had to swear Joe Biden in as the nominee before that in a virtual realm.
[00:27:43.417 --> 00:27:46.378]  So this whole thing is a complete disaster if you're the Democrats.
[00:27:47.938 --> 00:27:53.606]   But they've got their main trick up their sleeve, which is Stuff the ballots.
[00:27:54.266 --> 00:27:54.827]  Stuff them.
[00:27:55.587 --> 00:27:56.187]  Vote early.
[00:27:56.287 --> 00:27:56.987]  Vote often.
[00:27:57.047 --> 00:27:58.067]  Vote multiple times.
[00:27:58.167 --> 00:27:58.828]  Dead voters.
[00:27:58.928 --> 00:27:59.608]  Pet voters.
[00:28:01.348 --> 00:28:04.609]  But if that's their only game plan, then I think they're going to run into trouble.
[00:28:05.749 --> 00:28:09.390]  Because you can't have an election too big to rig, as long as the machines are fair.
[00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:10.430]  That's a whole other debate.
[00:28:11.751 --> 00:28:13.551]  You can't have an election that's too big to rig.
[00:28:15.134 --> 00:28:20.435]  And to say the Republicans have done nothing after 2020 is just not accurate.
[00:28:20.755 --> 00:28:23.876]  There's going to be thousands of lawyers that are going to be at the polling stations.
[00:28:24.476 --> 00:28:29.878]  The Republicans have found thousands of poll watchers that are going to volunteer, and they're going to be all over the country.
[00:28:30.218 --> 00:28:31.978]  And the Democrats are panicked about this, by the way.
[00:28:32.218 --> 00:28:39.800]  And they write stories in the New York Times, Washington Post, Newsweek, and they say, the Trump Republican Party is hiring rogue people.
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:45.361]  They're hiring people, violent people, extremist people to go out and poll watch.
[00:28:46.102 --> 00:28:46.202]  Oh.
[00:28:46.862 --> 00:28:49.583]  Why are you so afraid of people watching the polls on election day?
[00:28:49.683 --> 00:28:53.684]  Why are Democrats so afraid of Republican poll watchers?
[00:28:54.524 --> 00:28:55.905]  Why would that be?
[00:28:56.445 --> 00:28:56.565]  Hmm.
[00:29:00.657 --> 00:29:06.345]  I have to say that I don't see a big solution other than some sort of mandatory vaccination.
[00:29:06.405 --> 00:29:09.589]  I know federal officials don't like to use that term.
[00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:20.520]   Once people feel empowered and protected legally, you're going to have schools Universities and colleges are going to say, you want to come to this college, buddy?
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:21.901]  You're going to get vaccinated.
[00:29:22.121 --> 00:29:23.582]  Lady, you're going to get vaccinated.
[00:29:24.202 --> 00:29:30.805]  Big corporations like Amazon and Facebook and all of those others are going to say, you want to work for us?
[00:29:30.845 --> 00:29:31.706]  You get vaccinated.
[00:29:32.426 --> 00:29:42.871]  And it's been proven that when you make it difficult for people in their lives, they lose their ideological bullshit and they get vaccinated.
[00:29:43.152 --> 00:29:45.693]  So he's talking about making things more difficult.
[00:29:46.317 --> 00:29:49.458]  You know, if you want to get into college, if you want to do anything, right?
[00:29:49.518 --> 00:29:51.799]  You just get vaxxed and you can do whatever you want.
[00:29:52.279 --> 00:29:57.641]  Now let's apply that to the economy and what we've talked about numerous times about central bank digital currency.
[00:29:58.901 --> 00:30:04.583]  If you want social security, well, you better have their digital system with the FedNow app or whatever, right?
[00:30:04.603 --> 00:30:09.985]   It's like, how many people are going to say, I don't know about this.
[00:30:10.185 --> 00:30:11.246]  Maybe it's the mark of the beast.
[00:30:11.286 --> 00:30:13.048]  Maybe it is intrusion on my bank account.
[00:30:13.068 --> 00:30:13.708]  Maybe it's this.
[00:30:13.748 --> 00:30:14.589]  But I need my paycheck.
[00:30:14.769 --> 00:30:16.571]  But I need my paycheck.
[00:30:16.611 --> 00:30:22.776]  You make it really, really difficult to say no, and you're going to have a lot of the population that complies.
[00:30:23.096 --> 00:30:27.280]  Just like with pandemics, just like with the economy, just like with the banks.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:31.123]  And so this is the world that we're entering into.
[00:30:31.503 --> 00:30:37.888]   But if you're an investor, Your goal should be to buy low, sell high, maximize your profits, and that's what we do.
[00:30:38.369 --> 00:30:46.194]  And we'll hold your hand through the economy, we'll let you know when it's time to buy, sell, reallocate, do whatever needs to be done, so you don't have to watch those like a hawk.
[00:30:46.295 --> 00:30:53.120]  And so, because we do, and now you can do that with an IRA, you can do that with a non-IRA, you can do that with your cash accounts, brokerage accounts.
[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:57.022]  You can take delivery of it at home, or you can have it stored.
[00:30:57.482 --> 00:31:03.045]  So many options, and we can't use a cookie-cutter approach, Alex, because everybody's different.
[00:31:03.585 --> 00:31:04.925]  Everybody has a different need.
[00:31:05.006 --> 00:31:06.366]  Is it growth, or is it income?
[00:31:06.406 --> 00:31:07.627]  Are you close to retirement?
[00:31:07.687 --> 00:31:08.347]  Are you young?
[00:31:08.847 --> 00:31:13.070]  And that's why we spend so much time educating our clients on what makes the most sense.
[00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:26.965]  They get a consultation, they talk to you, and you guys want a long-term relationship, and then boom, you deliver it to them or to a repository where they want to have this stored.
[00:31:27.446 --> 00:31:28.287]  It's so simple.
[00:31:28.347 --> 00:31:29.368]  You're the place to go.
[00:31:29.748 --> 00:31:32.712]  Everybody should give you guys a call or send an email right now.

[00:33:02.056 --> 00:33:06.142]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:06.442 --> 00:33:08.242]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.242 --> 00:33:21.923]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[00:33:22.284 --> 00:33:27.186]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[00:33:30.548 --> 00:33:38.733]  So there's Joe Biden at the G7 having no clue what's going on.
[00:33:39.513 --> 00:33:48.158]  Shuffling his legs with his special shoes on, confused and disoriented, being drug around and led around by the other world leaders.
[00:33:49.275 --> 00:33:51.416]  The guy literally doesn't know what planet he's on, folks.
[00:33:52.376 --> 00:33:53.756]  It's an international embarrassment.
[00:33:56.937 --> 00:34:05.279]  And you know, by the way, and I'm going to show the rest of these Biden clips, but I'm going to mention this right now because it's extremely important.
[00:34:05.919 --> 00:34:27.778]   Until last night, nobody in the mainstream media was talking about the Russian military drills and submarines that had arrived in Cuba 60 miles off the Florida coast and last night it was only one
[00:34:27.778 --> 00:34:37.138]   network that was covering it and that was Fox News. Now this was the biggest story you've probably heard about the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[00:34:37.138 --> 00:34:43.671]   That was one of the biggest stories it's It's in all the American history textbooks.
[00:34:43.891 --> 00:34:45.631]  Everybody has to learn about that in school.
[00:34:46.592 --> 00:34:48.272]  And so how is this not a bigger story?
[00:34:48.452 --> 00:34:49.832]  How is this not a top story?
[00:34:50.313 --> 00:35:04.316]  And to kind of put it into perspective, when they made up Trump-Russia collusion, a completely fabricated fairy tale that they just made up, whole cloth, Hillary Clinton opposition research.
[00:35:05.816 --> 00:35:08.317]  You want to talk about campaign finance violations, there it is.
[00:35:10.117 --> 00:35:11.458]  So fake Russian collusion.
[00:35:11.879 --> 00:35:13.080]  Fake Russian interference.
[00:35:16.423 --> 00:35:17.925]  Or even what Russia's doing in Ukraine.
[00:35:18.485 --> 00:35:20.728]  So they build up Russia as this boogeyman.
[00:35:20.748 --> 00:35:22.710]  They build up Russia as your biggest enemy.
[00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:25.713]  They build up Russia as the most dangerous force on Earth.
[00:35:28.766 --> 00:35:42.575]  With their made-up stuff and the Ukraine war, and then Russia is 60 miles off the Florida coast doing military drills with hypersonic missiles, with submarines, and the media doesn't even report on it!
[00:35:44.116 --> 00:35:45.077]  It's not even a story!
[00:35:47.218 --> 00:35:47.938]  Now why is that?
[00:35:48.179 --> 00:35:56.384]  If Russia is this big boogeyman, if Russia is the worst thing in the world, how are they not reporting on them doing military drills 60 miles off the Florida coast?
[00:35:57.742 --> 00:35:58.942]  How is that not a bigger story?
[00:35:59.082 --> 00:36:02.543]  Only Fox News has covered it, from what I've seen, and I monitor all the mainstream news.
[00:36:03.603 --> 00:36:04.724]  How is that not a bigger story?
[00:36:04.764 --> 00:36:06.684]  Well, it makes Biden look weak.
[00:36:06.984 --> 00:36:08.405]  It makes Biden look feckless.
[00:36:08.585 --> 00:36:14.026]  It makes the Democrat Party's chances of winning in the elections in 2024 worse.
[00:36:16.687 --> 00:36:21.258]   And now, apparently, And there's all kinds of forces at play here.
[00:36:21.818 --> 00:36:26.841]  The Biden administration is now panicked about a potential terror attack, folks.
[00:36:27.761 --> 00:36:28.882]  Only for election purposes.
[00:36:29.362 --> 00:36:31.583]  Not because they care if Americans die.
[00:36:31.743 --> 00:36:32.503]  They could care less.
[00:36:34.604 --> 00:36:36.205]  I guess they couldn't care less.
[00:36:37.025 --> 00:36:40.047]  So it's not about protecting the American people and stopping a terror attack.
[00:36:40.607 --> 00:36:48.538]   Now the Biden administration is putting extra pressure on the FBI And this is why you saw that arrest, that sting operation.
[00:36:49.438 --> 00:36:52.501]  Eight suspected terrorists get arrested in three different states.
[00:36:55.363 --> 00:36:58.506]  They're panicked that it's going to hurt them in the 2024 election.
[00:37:00.106 --> 00:37:05.912]  So, the Democrat propaganda media won't cover Russia 60 miles off the coast.
[00:37:06.132 --> 00:37:07.674]  They'll cover all kinds of made-up crap.
[00:37:07.694 --> 00:37:10.016]  They'll make up crap about Russia and cover that.
[00:37:10.677 --> 00:37:18.264]  But when Russia's right off of the coast, where people swim over here from Cuba, float on rafts over here, then they don't cover it.
[00:37:18.304 --> 00:37:19.265]  Then it's not a story.
[00:37:19.726 --> 00:37:22.008]  So it's like, when it's actually a story, it's not a story.
[00:37:22.188 --> 00:37:25.409]  When it's a fake story, then it's the big story and they give themselves awards over it.
[00:37:25.649 --> 00:37:27.310]  They do whole entire shows over it.
[00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:31.752]  They dedicate their entire news networks to the fraud when it's Russia.
[00:37:31.792 --> 00:37:33.653]  But then when it's an actual story, they just totally ignore it.
[00:37:35.033 --> 00:37:40.536]  So that kind of puts it all into perspective of just how corrupt the media is.
[00:37:40.556 --> 00:37:43.257]  This was the biggest story, the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[00:37:43.397 --> 00:37:44.737]  You always learn about it in textbooks.
[00:37:45.158 --> 00:37:51.998]   But now that it's Russia over there and we're helping Ukraine, In their war with Russia and NATO getting on Russia's doorstep?
[00:37:52.499 --> 00:37:53.880]  Oh, let's just not even talk about that.
[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:56.402]  And I'm not even saying Russia wants to attack us.
[00:37:58.263 --> 00:38:08.185]   It could just be kind of this tit-for-tat like, yeah, you want to put Ukraine with missiles To fire into Russia at our doorstep.
[00:38:08.666 --> 00:38:12.548]  You want to put NATO, an anti-Russia organization, at our doorstep.
[00:38:12.848 --> 00:38:13.629]  How do you like it?
[00:38:13.789 --> 00:38:18.592]  How about we put our submarines and hypersonic missiles on your doorstep?
[00:38:18.912 --> 00:38:19.552]  How do you like it?
[00:38:19.632 --> 00:38:20.653]  And then the media ignores it.
[00:38:21.653 --> 00:38:23.615]  So this is how sick the Biden administration is.
[00:38:23.695 --> 00:38:25.416]  This is how sick the Democrat Party is.
[00:38:25.516 --> 00:38:26.636]  It's all about power.
[00:38:27.817 --> 00:38:29.398]  It's all about power.
[00:38:30.679 --> 00:38:34.501]  Do they close the border to protect you from a potential terror attack?
[00:38:35.082 --> 00:38:35.302]  No.
[00:38:36.516 --> 00:38:49.621]  But the Biden White House is putting extra pressure on DHS and FBI right now to stop any potential terror attacks because they're afraid it will hurt their chances of winning the election in 2024.
[00:38:50.581 --> 00:38:52.762]  Not because they care about protecting American lives.
[00:38:53.642 --> 00:38:56.184]  Not because they even care about a potential terror attack.
[00:38:56.224 --> 00:38:57.284]  If they did, they'd close the border.
[00:38:57.644 --> 00:39:06.729]  They only care, with 143 days till the election, they only care because it may hurt their election chances if there's a terror attack.
[00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:12.853]  And they don't cover the biggest story dealing with Russia because it makes them look bad.
[00:39:15.874 --> 00:39:17.895]  But I'm getting off base.
[00:39:18.296 --> 00:39:25.245]   By the way, Biden and Zelensky are glad-handing at The G7 Summit.
[00:39:26.585 --> 00:39:28.527]  And this Zelensky, this guy is such a twerp.
[00:39:29.908 --> 00:39:32.429]  He's running around in his fake little military garb.
[00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:34.350]  That fat little midget.
[00:39:36.692 --> 00:39:40.454]  Running around in his olive green shirts.
[00:39:42.956 --> 00:39:45.217]  The guy can't even put on a jacket.
[00:39:45.277 --> 00:39:46.898]  He can't even put on a suit and tie.
[00:39:46.918 --> 00:39:52.042]  He is just, it's just, and it's almost like he's doing it intentionally.
[00:39:52.932 --> 00:39:57.836]  To just rub it in your face that the whole thing is just a joke and he doesn't have any respect and he doesn't care.
[00:39:58.717 --> 00:39:59.658]  The whole thing is an act.
[00:39:59.698 --> 00:40:01.720]  He's pretending to be this military man.
[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:03.221]  He's pretending to be this strong man.
[00:40:03.261 --> 00:40:05.943]  He's pretending to wage this war on Russia.
[00:40:06.264 --> 00:40:17.453]  And he's nothing but a blackmailed theater gay guy who probably got put in there by the CIA.
[00:40:19.434 --> 00:40:22.817]  So he runs around in his little outfit, little Humpty Dumpty thing.
[00:40:24.458 --> 00:40:28.901]  Everybody else wearing suits and ties, big international diplomatic meetings, the G7.
[00:40:28.941 --> 00:40:32.144]  And he's running around in his little fake military gear because he's at war!
[00:40:32.204 --> 00:40:33.024]  He's a military!
[00:40:33.324 --> 00:40:37.127]  I'm surprised he's not wearing like an official military outfit like a four-star general or something.
[00:40:38.448 --> 00:40:39.349]  He's a thespian!
[00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:41.731]  He's an actor!
[00:40:44.008 --> 00:40:53.777]  So this fat little twerp that's gotten hundreds of billions of dollars from us doesn't even have the respect to dress up for the G7 conference.
[00:40:53.797 --> 00:40:55.719]  He runs around and he gives Biden the script.
[00:40:56.239 --> 00:40:57.500]  And Biden's like, oh, who are you?
[00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:59.342]  Oh, yeah, you're the guy we're giving all that money to.
[00:40:59.382 --> 00:40:59.782]  That's right.
[00:40:59.822 --> 00:41:01.023]  Yeah, keep laundering the money for us.
[00:41:01.043 --> 00:41:03.205]  I mean, he's getting off the plane.
[00:41:03.225 --> 00:41:03.726]  I think it's clip 13.
[00:41:03.766 --> 00:41:04.747]  Here he is.
[00:41:04.787 --> 00:41:05.727]  He's getting off the plane.
[00:41:06.048 --> 00:41:07.269]  Again, he doesn't even know where he is.
[00:41:08.351 --> 00:41:10.972]  He gets off the plane and then he's like, where am I?
[00:41:11.032 --> 00:41:11.493]  Who am I?
[00:41:11.553 --> 00:41:12.133]  What's going on?
[00:41:12.593 --> 00:41:19.337]  And there's always, there has to be now, there have to be multiple handlers to point Joe Biden in the right direction.
[00:41:19.397 --> 00:41:22.058]  He doesn't even know where he is.
[00:41:22.078 --> 00:41:28.262]  He gets off the airplane and okay, first, here's his first two handlers and they say, okay, you're going over here.
[00:41:28.282 --> 00:41:30.883]  And then he walks the wrong direction.
[00:41:31.844 --> 00:41:35.826]  The one handler has to follow him because he's going the wrong direction.
[00:41:36.613 --> 00:41:37.414]  I don't know where he's going.
[00:41:37.534 --> 00:41:38.815]  Going the complete wrong direction.
[00:41:39.775 --> 00:41:42.737]  So now he has to grab him and say, nope, actually you're going this way, Joe.
[00:41:42.978 --> 00:41:44.178]  Oh, oh, I'm over here now?
[00:41:44.339 --> 00:41:44.679]  Oh, okay.
[00:41:45.419 --> 00:41:47.561]  As he shuffles along, he can't even bend his knees.
[00:41:47.581 --> 00:41:53.245]  This is just a complete embarrassment.
[00:41:54.486 --> 00:41:55.266]  Everywhere he goes.
[00:41:55.487 --> 00:41:57.348]  He can't, folks, I'm telling you, it's like...
[00:41:59.179 --> 00:42:05.522]  He hasn't had a public appearance in weeks that hasn't been a complete embarrassment, that hasn't been a complete disaster.
[00:42:06.002 --> 00:42:12.064]  He can't do a public speech without slurring his words, forgetting his words, making things up, lying.
[00:42:12.085 --> 00:42:15.466]  He can't even walk without getting confused.
[00:42:15.706 --> 00:42:18.127]  He can't even walk off a stage without needing help.
[00:42:19.488 --> 00:42:25.010]  He just blanks out during the fake Juneteenth celebration, just stiff as a board.
[00:42:27.987 --> 00:42:31.649]  Here he is before exiting to go to the G7.
[00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:38.894]  He shakes Chuck Schumer's hand, and then he forgets he shook Chuck Schumer's hand, so he tries to shake it for a second time.
[00:42:39.815 --> 00:42:41.716]  Kind of awkward here in clip 11.
[00:42:44.638 --> 00:42:45.839]  So there's the handshake, and then...
[00:42:46.997 --> 00:42:51.458]  Now Joe Biden forgets, he reaches out his hand for a second handshake.
[00:42:53.259 --> 00:42:56.980]  That's what people are noticing about that video, but I want to play it again and I want you to listen to what Chuck Schumer says.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:04.762]  So we'll play it again, watch Joe Biden, forget he shook Chuck Schumer's hand, but then listen to what Chuck Schumer says at the end of that video.
[00:43:04.582 --> 00:43:18.502]   video go ahead and roll it again now our great speaker our partner who all of these bills we've met
[00:43:17.122 --> 00:43:18.263]  Our great speaker.
[00:43:18.623 --> 00:43:26.927]  There's Chuck Schumer, one of the dirtiest rats, one of the most crooked bastards in the history of the U.S.
[00:43:26.967 --> 00:43:31.089]  Congress, and he's up there thanking Speaker Mike Johnson.
[00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:33.330]  That's disgusting.
[00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:35.491]  That makes me sick.
[00:43:37.952 --> 00:43:44.035]  Now we'll look at some of the propaganda that the Democrats are putting out, but maybe first we should revisit a Kamala Harris clip.
[00:43:44.616 --> 00:43:46.337]  Well, this is a new clip, we're not revisiting it.
[00:43:47.917 --> 00:43:49.558]  This woman is such a forced act.
[00:43:51.459 --> 00:43:57.022]  This woman is such a forced act that it's the most cringeworthy thing you've ever seen in your life.
[00:43:57.543 --> 00:44:00.424]  And then she always tries to fill in the gap with her little cackle.
[00:44:03.346 --> 00:44:04.547]  But what is she even saying?
[00:44:05.546 --> 00:44:14.050]  Here's the word vomit from Kamala Harris that then fills the awkwardness in the room with her hyena cackle in clip 15.
[00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:18.592]  To aspire to create wealth is a good thing as far as I'm concerned.
[00:44:21.833 --> 00:44:23.194]  If that is what one chooses.
[00:44:23.414 --> 00:44:26.095]  I, on the other hand, have chosen to live a life of public service.
[00:44:29.176 --> 00:44:30.357]  But I am all for it.
[00:44:30.877 --> 00:44:32.558]  Get yours if that's what you want.
[00:44:33.797 --> 00:44:34.478]  We're trying.
[00:44:34.738 --> 00:44:38.041]  That's what this tour is about.
[00:44:41.324 --> 00:44:43.826]  So this is the party that raises taxes.
[00:44:44.346 --> 00:44:47.669]  This is the party that puts more regulations on small businesses.
[00:44:49.251 --> 00:44:53.574]  This is the party that hates the wealthy class and creates this class warfare.
[00:44:55.656 --> 00:44:59.520]  And she says, oh, we're here because we want you to be successful and rich.
[00:45:00.877 --> 00:45:03.118]  And the little tagline is freedom to thrive.
[00:45:03.938 --> 00:45:07.580]  This is the party that puts all the obstacles in your way.
[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:13.702]  This is the party that wants to lower the bar and have quote-unquote equity.
[00:45:13.722 --> 00:45:15.963]  It's not the freedom to thrive party.
[00:45:15.983 --> 00:45:17.704]  This isn't the get-yours party.
[00:45:17.784 --> 00:45:19.965]  This is the get-yours-and-we're-taking-it party.
[00:45:21.525 --> 00:45:24.687]  This is the try-to-get-yours-we're-gonna-put-a-bunch-of-obstacles-in-your-way.
[00:45:25.567 --> 00:45:35.410]   I mean the forced laugh, the cackle, Oh my gosh, there's never been a more embarrassing White House than this.
[00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:51.093]  Between poopy pants Joe Biden and cackling Kamala, this is, this is, I hope this is a low, at least for my life, I hope this is an all-time low when it comes to our representation in the White House with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
[00:45:51.173 --> 00:45:52.173]  It's never been this bad.
[00:45:52.853 --> 00:45:57.734]  I mean, as bad as Barack Obama was, at least he had some dignity and class and charisma.
[00:45:58.797 --> 00:46:00.258]  I mean, at least he played the role.
[00:46:01.599 --> 00:46:03.101]  These guys can't even play the role.
[00:46:05.763 --> 00:46:07.164]  Nobody would even take them seriously.
[00:46:07.184 --> 00:46:13.229]  If you were casting a movie for president and vice president, they wouldn't even finish their lines.
[00:46:13.249 --> 00:46:17.053]  They'd say, get out, sorry, nope, get out, no, no chance, bye.
[00:46:19.054 --> 00:46:19.615]  And here we are.
[00:46:19.935 --> 00:46:32.333]   By the way, Hans Manki, Points this out, and it just shows you kind of the state of the world leadership right now.
[00:46:33.194 --> 00:46:34.335]  All the world leaders at the G7.
[00:46:37.418 --> 00:46:39.820]  You have an unelected Eurocrat.
[00:46:40.581 --> 00:46:43.583]  You have a man who just lost his election.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:48.102]  You have Justin Trudeau, 50-year low poll numbers, very unpopular.
[00:46:48.643 --> 00:46:51.305]  You have Macron, whose party just lost an election.
[00:46:52.185 --> 00:46:56.088]  You have Joe Biden, who's too senile to know where he's at or face trial.
[00:46:56.928 --> 00:47:03.333]  You have a man with a 26% approval rating, only rivaling Justin Trudeau's.
[00:47:04.656 --> 00:47:10.881]  You have another man who's about to lose an election, and then on the other end you have another unelected Eurocrat.
[00:47:11.602 --> 00:47:13.343]  So these people don't represent anyone.
[00:47:13.363 --> 00:47:20.889]  I mean, maybe Maloney in the middle is the only one that represents her people, and the only one that's even popular at all.
[00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:29.917]  Everyone else is either severely unpopular or wasn't even elected, or doesn't even know where he is, in the case of Joe Biden.
[00:47:30.638 --> 00:47:31.618]  And that's your world leadership.
[00:47:31.678 --> 00:47:32.979]  That's who's representing us at the G7.
[00:47:34.312 --> 00:47:39.215]  Unelected, unpopular, corrupt rats.
[00:47:40.155 --> 00:47:42.877]  And this is who runs the planet, and that's the problem.
[00:47:44.358 --> 00:47:45.238]  And that's the problem.
[00:47:45.318 --> 00:47:48.140]  Alright, let's look at some of this other Democrat Party propaganda here.
[00:47:50.621 --> 00:47:53.122]  Joe Biden puts out this ad this morning.
[00:47:53.963 --> 00:47:59.246]  They have nothing to run on but abortion on January 6th, and so here's the latest January 6th propaganda, clip 12.
[00:48:00.188 --> 00:48:03.312]  On January 6th, Donald Trump lit a fire in this country.
[00:48:04.514 --> 00:48:05.876]  140 officers were injured.
[00:48:06.197 --> 00:48:08.159]  The siege lasted for seven hours.
[00:48:08.954 --> 00:48:11.054]  Stoking the flames of division and hate.
[00:48:11.395 --> 00:48:13.135]  Now, he's pouring gasoline.
[00:48:13.235 --> 00:48:14.855]  They were unbelievable patriots.
[00:48:14.915 --> 00:48:18.276]  Pledging to pardon the extremists who tried to overthrow our government.
[00:48:18.456 --> 00:48:19.976]  We will give them pardons.
[00:48:20.196 --> 00:48:21.837]  Inciting them to try again.
[00:48:22.217 --> 00:48:24.617]  There is nothing more sacred than our democracy.
[00:48:24.877 --> 00:48:27.158]  But Donald Trump's ready to burn it all down.
[00:48:27.558 --> 00:48:29.698]  I'm Joe Biden, and I approve this message.
[00:48:30.098 --> 00:48:31.719]  Yes, I'm sure you did, Joe.
[00:48:32.499 --> 00:48:33.519]  So, okay.
[00:48:34.403 --> 00:48:36.284]  The siege that lasted seven hours.
[00:48:36.304 --> 00:48:38.245]  140 police officers injured.
[00:48:38.926 --> 00:48:43.889]  Well, let's just take that and pretend like there's some reality there.
[00:48:43.989 --> 00:48:44.710]  And maybe there is.
[00:48:46.271 --> 00:48:48.352]  Okay, now do the Black Lives Matter protests.
[00:48:48.452 --> 00:48:50.093]  Now do the Antifa protests.
[00:48:50.193 --> 00:48:52.655]  Now do the pro-Palestinian protests.
[00:48:56.457 --> 00:48:57.898]  Yeah, now do all the leftist protests.
[00:48:57.978 --> 00:48:58.778]  Oh, seven hours.
[00:48:59.219 --> 00:49:02.401]  How about seven weeks of George Floyd riots?
[00:49:03.646 --> 00:49:05.868]  How about two billion dollars in property damage?
[00:49:06.068 --> 00:49:08.870]  How about thousands of police officers injured?
[00:49:11.112 --> 00:49:13.234]  No, that doesn't count.
[00:49:15.636 --> 00:49:18.438]  Liberal terrorism, Democrat terrorism doesn't count.
[00:49:18.578 --> 00:49:20.560]  It's justified and it's mostly peaceful.
[00:49:21.961 --> 00:49:24.303]  See?
[00:49:24.383 --> 00:49:28.647]  But now they're going back to January 6th to run cover for the Pelosi video that just came out.
[00:49:29.724 --> 00:49:31.045]  And they just have nothing else to run on.
[00:49:31.466 --> 00:49:32.687]  They can't run on the economy.
[00:49:32.727 --> 00:49:33.788]  They can't run on the border.
[00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:41.374]  They can't run on anything except January 6th and abortion.
[00:49:42.776 --> 00:49:43.156]  Abortion.
[00:49:43.496 --> 00:49:46.019]  By the way, they're getting called out about the latest jobs numbers.
[00:49:46.179 --> 00:49:46.799]  It's not good.
[00:49:47.694 --> 00:49:50.457]  They keep claiming greatest economy ever, greatest jobs numbers ever.
[00:49:50.537 --> 00:49:52.679]  Well, even the left is starting to call them out on this.
[00:49:52.959 --> 00:49:54.240]  This is a Bloomberg headline.
[00:49:54.961 --> 00:49:55.221]  U.S.
[00:49:55.261 --> 00:49:59.665]  payroll gains not as robust as reported data suggests.
[00:50:00.226 --> 00:50:11.096]  And then Jerome Powell had a press conference today and he had to admit that the numbers and the claims that the White House are making are inaccurate.
[00:50:12.079 --> 00:50:15.421]  And that the jobs reports are not as good as the White House is claiming.
[00:50:16.202 --> 00:50:21.105]  So those are their own people calling the Biden administration liars when it comes to the economy.
[00:50:21.385 --> 00:50:22.486]  But what else can they do?
[00:50:24.408 --> 00:50:26.169]  So here's more Democrat Party propaganda.
[00:50:26.209 --> 00:50:32.793]  Now, this is, I mean, this is straight up bought and paid for propaganda.
[00:50:34.755 --> 00:50:40.379]  And so they hire this, they have a couple of these young guys that they pay.
[00:50:41.445 --> 00:50:43.965]  Through these super PACs that the Democrats run.
[00:50:44.706 --> 00:50:45.466]  And then they deny it.
[00:50:45.506 --> 00:50:46.546]  It's all public information.
[00:50:46.886 --> 00:50:51.967]  It's all in the public information reports that these guys have been paid.
[00:50:53.327 --> 00:50:56.228]  But they have a type.
[00:50:56.368 --> 00:50:58.528]  It's the feminine male type.
[00:50:58.628 --> 00:50:59.948]  It's your typical liberal male.
[00:51:00.008 --> 00:51:01.689]  Probably gay.
[00:51:03.929 --> 00:51:09.270]  And has a hard time trying to convince you in this video that he's straight.
[00:51:10.686 --> 00:51:11.866]  Forget about the optics of it.
[00:51:11.946 --> 00:51:14.587]  Listen, listen, because this is all Democrat Party script.
[00:51:15.488 --> 00:51:20.849]  Listen to the argument he's making, this Democrat propaganda agent.
[00:51:22.070 --> 00:51:27.651]  Listen to the argument he's making for straight white guys between the ages of 18 and 29.
[00:51:29.412 --> 00:51:35.774]  Listen to the arguments he's making to convince them to vote for Joe Biden in clip 20.
[00:51:38.342 --> 00:51:45.804]  It's always crazy to me when I see, like, straight white guys between the ages of 18 and 29, like myself, supporting Donald Trump.
[00:51:45.824 --> 00:51:46.325]  Yeah, like you.
[00:51:46.425 --> 00:51:50.486]  Because, like, do you guys not realize how bad a Trump victory would be for you?
[00:51:50.506 --> 00:51:51.686]  Does that not click?
[00:51:51.906 --> 00:51:59.689]  Like, if you have a woman in your life, a girlfriend, a mother, a sister, Donald Trump is running on taking their reproductive rights away.
[00:51:59.709 --> 00:52:00.389]  Okay, pause it right here.
[00:52:00.409 --> 00:52:02.230]  Republicans in the Senate just voted against him.
[00:52:02.890 --> 00:52:03.730]  This is...
[00:52:07.628 --> 00:52:09.829]  Folks, I'm stunned at this.
[00:52:10.389 --> 00:52:11.590]  I mean, I'm not, but I am.
[00:52:13.391 --> 00:52:18.234]  So, if you're, because you're straight like him, yeah, sure buddy, uh-huh.
[00:52:19.234 --> 00:52:20.735]  We know you're real straight.
[00:52:24.477 --> 00:52:26.178]  Straight white guys like me?
[00:52:26.738 --> 00:52:28.039]  How can you vote Donald Trump?
[00:52:28.079 --> 00:52:32.721]  Well, I don't know, maybe we just don't want corruption in the White House, maybe we want a secure border, maybe we want a booming economy.
[00:52:32.741 --> 00:52:32.781]  No!
[00:52:35.310 --> 00:52:39.433]  No, you want your wife and your girlfriend and your mother to have an abortion!
[00:52:41.795 --> 00:52:43.456]  That's your pitch?
[00:52:44.317 --> 00:52:45.077]  That's your angle?
[00:52:47.479 --> 00:52:55.385]  Where do you think abortion is on the list of political issues for straight, white, young men?
[00:52:57.363 --> 00:53:02.587]  Do you think the average straight white young man is thinking about abortion?
[00:53:02.707 --> 00:53:09.153]  Yeah, maybe like the 5% that's a liberal cuck, but they're not impregnating women anyway.
[00:53:10.474 --> 00:53:12.456]  So who is this message catered to?
[00:53:12.536 --> 00:53:14.337]  Where are you reaching here?
[00:53:15.078 --> 00:53:23.605]  The argument is, if you're a straight white young man, you should vote Democrat so that you can kill your offspring.
[00:53:26.331 --> 00:53:31.615]  This has to be one of the most disgusting and deranged pitches I've ever heard.
[00:53:31.635 --> 00:53:36.759]  And, but... He's straight like you!
[00:53:36.779 --> 00:53:42.223]  Hey, I'm gonna go out, because I'm straight!
[00:53:43.163 --> 00:53:48.967]  And I'm gonna go out there and I'm gonna convince other straight men like me that we need to kill our kids!
[00:53:50.148 --> 00:53:50.649]  Wow!
[00:53:52.449 --> 00:53:52.950]  Wow!
[00:53:53.832 --> 00:53:54.834]  This is their big push!
[00:53:55.376 --> 00:53:56.518]  January 6th and abortion.
[00:53:56.578 --> 00:53:58.061]  Alright, play the rest of the propaganda clip.
[00:53:58.821 --> 00:54:02.442]  Donald Trump is running on taking their reproductive rights away.
[00:54:02.862 --> 00:54:08.763]  Republicans in the Senate just voted against a bill that would protect their access to contraception the other day.
[00:54:08.903 --> 00:54:09.863]  Actually, that didn't happen.
[00:54:09.903 --> 00:54:11.203]  Pause it, pause it, pause it.
[00:54:11.623 --> 00:54:12.744]  So they just lie about everything.
[00:54:13.204 --> 00:54:18.705]  Supreme Court upholds access to abortion drug and it was unanimous, actually.
[00:54:19.085 --> 00:54:29.049]   And this is the Supreme Court that the Democrats are attacking right now and the conservative justices like Alito and Thomas that they're trying to destroy their lives right now.
[00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:31.231]  So, it's just not happening.
[00:54:31.451 --> 00:54:40.418]  Now, at the state level, at the state level, there's been some rumblings and grumblings about contraceptives and access to that, but there's been no legislation passed.
[00:54:40.518 --> 00:54:41.519]  They're not banned anywhere.
[00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:43.780]  So, again, it's just made up.
[00:54:44.661 --> 00:54:45.702]  But, okay, continue.
[00:54:47.844 --> 00:54:48.024]  Obama.
[00:54:47.864 --> 00:54:50.583]  and you think that Donald Trump's gonna protect your job.
[00:54:50.583 --> 00:54:51.603]  Sorry, no.
[00:54:51.603 --> 00:54:57.144]   Donald Trump outsourced more jobs than Obama, and right now there's a manufacturing boom
[00:54:57.144 --> 00:54:58.423]  because of President Biden.
[00:54:58.423 --> 00:54:59.264]  Don't believe me?
[00:54:59.264 --> 00:55:00.103]  Look it up for yourself.
[00:55:00.103 --> 00:55:03.184]   Or maybe you're just like, "Yeah, I hate the inflation and the gas prices,
[00:55:03.184 --> 00:55:04.224]  so I like Trump."
[00:55:04.224 --> 00:55:08.023]   Well, I hate to break it to you because contrary to what Donald Trump tells you,
[00:55:08.023 --> 00:55:11.583]   Joe Biden is not responsible for the inflation or the high gas prices.
[00:55:11.589 --> 00:55:14.231]  That happened all around the world as a result of the pandemic.
[00:55:14.291 --> 00:55:17.612]  And actually, right now, we're drilling more oil than ever before.
[00:55:17.632 --> 00:55:18.713]  We're drilling more than ever!
[00:55:18.793 --> 00:55:20.093]  And inflation has fallen rapidly.
[00:55:20.133 --> 00:55:24.175]  And many economists are saying that Donald Trump's policies are far more inflationary.
[00:55:24.195 --> 00:55:24.455]  Oh my gosh!
[00:55:24.475 --> 00:55:25.656]  It can make the situation worse.
[00:55:25.956 --> 00:55:29.237]  Point is, there's nothing manly or cool about voting for Donald Trump.
[00:55:29.257 --> 00:55:34.418]  What's actually honorable is standing up for people whose voices may not be as loud as yours.
[00:55:34.999 --> 00:55:35.639]  Food for thought.
[00:55:36.219 --> 00:55:36.939]  Wow, man.
[00:55:36.979 --> 00:55:37.839]  You've convinced me.
[00:55:37.859 --> 00:55:39.540]  I want to kill my offspring.
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:41.841]  Nothing is Joe Biden's fault!
[00:55:42.861 --> 00:55:43.741]  I'm so stupid!
[00:55:44.841 --> 00:55:45.262]  Silly me.
[00:55:45.842 --> 00:55:47.542]  I should do the honorable thing and vote Joe Biden.
[00:55:48.443 --> 00:55:49.743]  Say Donald Trump one more time.
[00:55:51.607 --> 00:55:53.188]  Inflation is not Joe Biden's fault.
[00:55:53.228 --> 00:55:54.669]  Gas prices are rising around the world.
[00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:55.830]  Actually, no they're not.
[00:55:55.890 --> 00:56:08.640]  They're rising in the Western countries because they're passing bills that cut into energy production and they're isolating themselves from Russia or becoming reliant on Russian energy.
[00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:13.283]  So isolating themselves politically but becoming reliant on Russian energy and gas.
[00:56:14.044 --> 00:56:15.385]  That's why prices are going up.
[00:56:17.096 --> 00:56:18.257]  It's not Joe Biden's fault!
[00:56:18.597 --> 00:56:19.497]  Why do you have to tell me that?
[00:56:19.617 --> 00:56:20.818]  Because it is Joe Biden's fault!
[00:56:21.178 --> 00:56:22.719]  And everybody knows it's Joe Biden's fault!
[00:56:23.319 --> 00:56:26.020]  We're four years out of the pandemic and you're still blaming the pandemic.
[00:56:27.981 --> 00:56:29.422]  This is incredible propaganda.
[00:56:30.062 --> 00:56:31.743]  But hey guys, come on.
[00:56:32.283 --> 00:56:33.564]  This is, this is, you know.
[00:56:34.244 --> 00:56:38.366]  That actually, that's about 60 seconds of pure truth.
[00:56:38.826 --> 00:56:40.107]  He's a straight white male.
[00:56:41.888 --> 00:56:43.889]  And the inflation is Donald Trump's fault.
[00:56:44.873 --> 00:56:47.414]  And Joe Biden is drilling more oil than anybody else.
[00:56:49.935 --> 00:56:52.356]  And, um, killing your kids is a good thing.
[00:56:52.736 --> 00:56:54.016]  And so you should vote Democrat.
[00:56:54.416 --> 00:56:55.217]  I mean, wow.
[00:56:55.357 --> 00:56:56.417]  That's, uh, boy.
[00:56:56.897 --> 00:57:00.177]  Do you think that message is resonating with straight white males?
[00:57:00.177 --> 00:57:06.577]  That's something else right there.
[00:57:06.761 --> 00:57:08.441]  Democrat Party propaganda.
[00:57:09.482 --> 00:57:10.402]  Don't worry, there's more.
[00:57:11.638 --> 00:57:18.998]  There's plenty more where that came from, as we enter the second hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:18.998 --> 00:57:33.318]  Good evening, America.
[00:57:33.499 --> 00:57:37.083]  I thought we'd take some time out of our daily lives and sit down for a nice little chat.
[00:57:37.443 --> 00:57:39.365]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[00:57:39.685 --> 00:57:43.189]  I suspect now even calls are being placed from the White House to members of Big Tech.
[00:57:43.469 --> 00:57:47.273]  I can almost hear George Takai and Stephen King tweeting furiously on their phones.
[00:57:47.393 --> 00:57:49.795]  And very soon, federal agents will be on their way.
[00:57:50.436 --> 00:57:50.716]  Why?
[00:57:51.016 --> 00:57:55.618]  Because words lead us to the truth, and the truth is, there is something very wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:57:55.978 --> 00:58:04.360]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression, and where once you had the freedom to object, until now you have had censors and systems of surveillance, coercing your conformity and soliciting your submission.
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:05.541]  How did this happen?
[00:58:06.101 --> 00:58:07.001]  Who's to blame?
[00:58:07.281 --> 00:58:11.162]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable.
[00:58:11.522 --> 00:58:16.204]  But truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:58:17.104 --> 00:58:18.164]  Oh, I know why you did it.
[00:58:18.384 --> 00:58:19.845]  You were afraid of the Orange Man.
[00:58:20.285 --> 00:58:20.867]  Who wouldn't be?
[00:58:21.307 --> 00:58:24.113]  Mean tweets, funny jokes and fights with Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:58:24.133 --> 00:58:28.482]  They got the better of you and in your panic you turned to Joseph Robinette Biden.
[00:58:29.161 --> 00:58:37.187]  He promised you war, he promised to forgive your student debts and make reparations for slavery, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:58:37.867 --> 00:58:43.952]  So if you have seen nothing, if the crimes of this government remain unknown to you, then I would suggest you allow the 5th of November to pass unmarked.
[00:58:44.492 --> 00:58:52.412]   But if you see as I see, if you feel as I feel, if you would seek as I seek, then I ask you to stand beside me at the ballot box,
[00:58:52.412 --> 00:59:00.332]  and together we shall give them a 5th of November that shall never, ever be forgot.
[00:59:00.332 --> 00:59:07.332]  [Music]
[00:59:07.557 --> 00:59:08.539]  It's happening now.
[00:59:09.421 --> 00:59:11.264]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:59:11.805 --> 00:59:13.609]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:59:14.370 --> 00:59:15.833]  We are the resistance.
[00:59:16.094 --> 00:59:18.094]  We are the InfoWars.
[00:59:18.094 --> 00:59:22.094]  [Sounds of a plane taking off]
[00:59:22.094 --> 00:59:28.094]  [Explosions]
[00:59:28.094 --> 00:59:37.094]  [Sounds of a plane taking off]
[00:59:37.094 --> 00:59:40.094]  [Sounds of a plane taking off]
[00:59:40.094 --> 00:59:41.094]  [Sounds of a plane taking off]
[00:59:41.203 --> 00:59:43.424]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:43.524 --> 00:59:56.724]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to The Alex Jones Show. And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:59:56.724 --> 01:00:06.644]  Kevin Spacey just got caught in a massive lie on world television concerning Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:00:07.210 --> 01:00:08.351]  He's caught, dead to rights.
[01:00:08.731 --> 01:00:09.331]  He's lying.
[01:00:09.551 --> 01:00:10.432]  We're about to expose him.
[01:00:12.853 --> 01:00:21.739]  Yesterday, Kevin Spacey went on Epstein Confidant, Piers Morgan's show, and got caught in a massive lie.
[01:00:22.386 --> 01:00:30.374]  And let's be clear, I'm not accusing him of being into little girls, because you know he likes men, but he's clearly caught in a massive lie.
[01:00:31.314 --> 01:00:36.800]  He says up front, I'm on this plane, never knew Epstein, didn't know he was on the plane, didn't know he was there.
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:40.523]  I was with the Clinton Foundation, which is a huge part of the whole Epstein operation.
[01:00:40.903 --> 01:00:42.245]  But he's like, I didn't know about this.
[01:00:42.325 --> 01:00:42.865]  I didn't know about this.
[01:00:42.885 --> 01:00:44.407]  I had no understanding of this.
[01:00:45.472 --> 01:00:58.364]  But then, in the two minute clip we're about to play, at the end he says, but I was worried on the plane because there's underage girls on the plane with Epstein and the Clintons and I thought they might basically use that against the Clintons.
[01:00:59.378 --> 01:01:09.261]  So, in just a few minutes here, he thinks we're so stupid or he's out of his mind that he says, I'm on the plane, never knew him, didn't know he owned it, didn't know who he was.
[01:01:09.881 --> 01:01:17.404]  He says, didn't know he owned it, didn't know who he was, didn't know him or his girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell.
[01:01:18.544 --> 01:01:26.107]  And by the end of the clip you're about to see, he says, oh, I was on the plane, really worried about them with these girls, and really worried about them trying to set up a Clintons.
[01:01:27.088 --> 01:01:31.313]  So he has a lot of explaining to do right now.
[01:01:31.774 --> 01:01:37.561]  But regardless, he then goes on to say he doesn't know Epstein, but there he is in the throne room.
[01:01:38.677 --> 01:01:49.376]   that he talks about in the weird sycophantic pro-royal system these guys are into with Piers Morgan, how they sat in the throne room and then we have photos and newscasts of them
[01:01:49.376 --> 01:02:00.416]   in the weird throne room with him sitting there with gasoline Maxwell, the female pimp of Jeffrey Epstein, the whole Mossad, CIA, MI6, honeypot, blackmail, pedophile operations.
[01:02:00.416 --> 01:02:12.677]   So hey, big surprise Kevin Spacey's a creep, big surprise he's lying to people, but this isn't House of Cards dude, we're here in this big mastermind, we don't see you, we see you.
[01:02:12.677 --> 01:02:24.717]   So he's been caught in a massive lie, here it is for yourself, I don't know why he's lying but he's definitely a bad liar, he's no Frank Underwood.
[01:02:24.717 --> 01:02:34.717]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:02:25.779 --> 01:02:37.090]  I started seeing reports online, things on my Twitter account, that I had flown to this guy Jeffrey Epstein's island and I had abused young girls.
[01:02:37.691 --> 01:02:46.239]  And I was like, I mean if you'd asked me in 2015, maybe even if you'd asked me in 2002, did I know a guy named Jeffrey Epstein, I probably would have said no.
[01:02:48.237 --> 01:03:00.347]  Well, of course I have since learned who he is, and I have since been able to go back and find out that the airplane that we flew on for this humanitarian mission was owned by Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:03:00.547 --> 01:03:03.390]  And to then learn, oh, he was actually on some of those flights.
[01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:06.472]  And this Maxwell woman was on some of those flights.
[01:03:08.094 --> 01:03:08.754]  I didn't know him.
[01:03:10.375 --> 01:03:11.637]  I've never spent any time with him.
[01:03:11.977 --> 01:03:13.638]  I was with the Clinton Foundation people.
[01:03:13.678 --> 01:03:14.439]  That's who I was with.
[01:03:17.324 --> 01:03:23.906]  Now what I understand is that he didn't start to be investigated until 2005 by authorities in Florida.
[01:03:25.667 --> 01:03:26.868]  So here's what I can tell you.
[01:03:30.289 --> 01:03:33.770]  This Maxwell woman, she was one of many people sat down next to me in that throne room.
[01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:36.091]  I have no relationship with her.
[01:03:36.211 --> 01:03:37.471]  I had no relationship with him.
[01:03:40.586 --> 01:03:53.904]  He's not my friend, I'm not a confidant, I've never spent time with him, and interestingly, I will say this, I was very fortunate that President Clinton introduced me to a lot of business leaders in London because he knew I was coming to the Old Vic.
[01:03:55.629 --> 01:04:11.274]  And I developed relationships with Robert Earle, Puli Ljubovic, Robert Earle, a lot of wonderful people, Richard Kering, people who supported the work that we did at the Old Vic and gave money to us.
[01:04:12.114 --> 01:04:13.895]  Do you know who I never asked for anything?
[01:04:13.915 --> 01:04:14.815]  It was Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:04:14.875 --> 01:04:21.637]  I didn't want to be around this guy because I felt he put the President at risk on that trip to South Africa because there were these young girls.
[01:04:22.297 --> 01:04:24.038]  And we were like, who is this guy?
[01:04:25.078 --> 01:04:26.599]  So, I will say this.
[01:04:26.679 --> 01:04:27.739]  There were young girls on those flights.
[01:04:27.559 --> 01:04:45.839]  those flights. There were young girls on those flights.

[01:05:58.867 --> 01:06:08.867]  Inflation's coming down at the same time.
[01:06:09.312 --> 01:06:11.332]  It's down 60% since last summer.
[01:06:11.352 --> 01:06:16.414]  I am so f***ing sick of this turkey neck bastard.
[01:06:17.327 --> 01:06:18.108]  I'm sick of them.
[01:06:18.588 --> 01:06:23.072]  And the fact that we gotta deal with this bitch until January is f***ing insane.
[01:06:24.033 --> 01:06:28.757]  If y'all vote this motherf***er back in, I'm gonna lose my s***.
[01:06:29.137 --> 01:06:30.399]  I'm gonna lose my f***ing head.
[01:06:31.379 --> 01:06:32.981]  Cause we already f***ed up.
[01:06:33.461 --> 01:06:36.784]  If you vote him back in, we are f***ing done for.
[01:06:37.485 --> 01:06:39.787]  He is f***ing destroying us.
[01:06:40.467 --> 01:06:42.870]  Do not get in my comments telling my son, you've had it for him.
[01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:43.930]  I didn't vote for that bitch.
[01:06:44.730 --> 01:06:45.830]  I don't like that f***ing man.
[01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:46.991]  I did not vote for his ass.
[01:06:48.251 --> 01:06:50.492]  He need to go to a f***ing nursing home or something.
[01:06:50.512 --> 01:06:51.712]  He don't need to be in the f***ing White House.
[01:06:52.392 --> 01:06:53.432]  He do not need to be in the White House.
[01:06:53.472 --> 01:06:56.073]  He is f***ing killing us.
[01:06:56.913 --> 01:07:02.655]  Like, we are barely f***ing surviving and you want to take away another means that's helping us.
[01:07:04.075 --> 01:07:05.556]  Are you f***ing kidding me?
[01:07:09.057 --> 01:07:10.357]  Oh, I'm done.
[01:07:11.058 --> 01:07:11.478]  I'm done.
[01:07:11.498 --> 01:07:13.038]  I don't want to live here anymore.
[01:07:13.058 --> 01:07:14.899]  This is ghetto.
[01:07:14.919 --> 01:07:16.339]  This is ghetto.
[01:07:16.599 --> 01:07:21.161]  I don't know why people want to come over here, talk about I want to live the American dream.
[01:07:21.461 --> 01:07:22.581]  It's not a dream, baby.
[01:07:23.101 --> 01:07:24.762]  It's a motherfucking nightmare.
[01:07:25.922 --> 01:07:26.622]  It's a nightmare.
[01:07:26.842 --> 01:07:27.262]  I'm done.
[01:07:27.442 --> 01:07:29.103]  I don't even want to live on the planet Earth anymore.
[01:07:29.323 --> 01:07:30.463]  Beam me up somewhere.
[01:07:30.763 --> 01:07:32.584]  Mars, Uranus, I don't give a fuck.
[01:07:34.492 --> 01:07:38.773]  I could do a whole compilation show with clips like this.
[01:07:39.814 --> 01:07:48.576]  And by the way, I hate the identity politics, but the fact that Donald Trump is going to win over many black voters is obviously a death blow to the Democrat Party and they know it.
[01:07:49.616 --> 01:07:51.436]  And that's a black woman talking.
[01:07:52.637 --> 01:07:57.178]  And by the way, it is mostly black people that are putting out videos like that.
[01:07:57.558 --> 01:08:01.739]  So I could do hours and compilations of very similar videos.
[01:08:03.171 --> 01:08:18.398]  And so what the mainstream media, what the Democratic Party is trying to do is tell you to ignore your own eyes, don't believe your lion eyes, don't believe your price at the pump, don't believe the price at the grocery store, don't even believe your own real world experience.
[01:08:18.558 --> 01:08:21.459]  Trust them to tell you what's going on in the world.
[01:08:21.499 --> 01:08:23.840]  Trust them to tell you what your life is actually like.
[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:25.741]  And nobody's buying it.
[01:08:27.199 --> 01:08:37.101]  And on top of that, Joe Biden is running around confused, dazed and confused, doesn't know where he is, crapping his pants, slurring and mumbling and bumbling through speeches, total embarrassment.
[01:08:37.421 --> 01:08:39.641]  Kamala Harris is cackling her way through events.
[01:08:40.661 --> 01:08:42.022]  So nobody is buying this.
[01:08:42.282 --> 01:08:51.683]  This is, this is famed fitness instructor Jillian Michaels talking about how the Democrats have destroyed California in clip two.
[01:08:52.523 --> 01:08:53.904]  California got too crazy for me.
[01:08:54.364 --> 01:08:54.544]  Why?
[01:08:56.324 --> 01:08:56.504]  Okay.
[01:08:57.113 --> 01:08:58.214]  This is my parting line.
[01:08:59.454 --> 01:09:00.095]  I grew up here.
[01:09:01.415 --> 01:09:01.935]  I'm a woman.
[01:09:02.816 --> 01:09:03.476]  I'm a gay woman.
[01:09:04.277 --> 01:09:04.897]  My mom's a Jew.
[01:09:05.517 --> 01:09:06.358]  My dad's an Arab.
[01:09:06.838 --> 01:09:07.618]  I have a black head.
[01:09:08.199 --> 01:09:12.041]  And believe it or not, my son is half-Latin, even though he doesn't look like it.
[01:09:12.961 --> 01:09:18.544]  I hold a million cards in your game of woke victimology poker.
[01:09:18.564 --> 01:09:22.566]  And when I leave California, me is Mamie!
[01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:38.648]  When you have me running from home, maybe it's gone way too far.
[01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:40.128]  What was the line?
[01:09:40.188 --> 01:09:42.188]  Like, what was it, I guess, the end game?
[01:09:42.188 --> 01:09:44.188]  Girl, there's not enough time.
[01:09:44.188 --> 01:09:52.188]   And, you know, I actually take this line from Bill and Elon Musk,
[01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:54.188]  and I'm like, I actually haven't changed.
[01:09:54.606 --> 01:09:57.727]  Because she says something, this is the most important part.
[01:09:59.688 --> 01:10:06.091]  Put politics aside, put policy aside, just kind of, just forget about the wonk.
[01:10:08.174 --> 01:10:17.218]  The key thing that she says there, and this is what needs to be recognized and understood, because you can have debates on policies, you can have different political stances, viewpoints, whatever.
[01:10:18.179 --> 01:10:18.859]  That's normal.
[01:10:20.179 --> 01:10:31.104]  What she says here, and this is the realization, the modern day left, Democrat, progressive, liberal, they have completely lost their minds.
[01:10:31.564 --> 01:10:32.345]  That's what this is.
[01:10:33.513 --> 01:10:35.354]  This is beyond a political viewpoint.
[01:10:35.414 --> 01:10:38.335]  This is beyond political debate, policy stance, whatever.
[01:10:38.815 --> 01:10:44.717]  This is the liberal progressive Democrat has lost their mind.
[01:10:45.077 --> 01:10:47.458]  They have gone completely psychotic.
[01:10:47.498 --> 01:10:54.500]  They have filled and corrupted themselves with hatred and envy and filth and degradation.
[01:10:55.717 --> 01:10:59.842]  And yes, it has resulted in policy that's just a complete disaster.
[01:11:00.263 --> 01:11:10.035]  Whether it's the policy of wide open borders, whether it's the policy of get rid of police, whether it's the policy of chop your little boys and girls balls and breasts off.
[01:11:11.417 --> 01:11:14.501]  They have lost their minds.
[01:11:16.604 --> 01:11:20.485]  So, she might have some liberal views, she might have some conservative views.
[01:11:21.285 --> 01:11:28.566]  It's the recognition now, looking at the modern day left, that they have lost their minds.
[01:11:29.306 --> 01:11:44.069]  And that's why Tulsi Gabbard left the Democrat Party, that's why Jillian Michaels is saying this, that's why she's about to talk about Elon Musk, Bill Maher, who are, Bill Maher, classical liberal, who's calling out the left now almost every day, and so she gets into that to finish the clip.
[01:11:45.336 --> 01:11:50.017]  The world around me is shifting and I haven't moved.
[01:11:51.017 --> 01:12:10.502]  So some of these laws that are passing here in relation to crime, protecting our kids, like we're decriminalizing everything, which arguably I would probably be okay with, but we're not regulating any of it.
[01:12:10.882 --> 01:12:11.042]  Right.
[01:12:12.065 --> 01:12:19.031]  So it's like, okay, you're going to decriminalize sex work, but only so women can legally loiter on the streets.
[01:12:19.051 --> 01:12:27.298]  Like, not to keep them safe, not to have them pay taxes, not to make them, you know, regularly check for STDs, not to take away the pimps out of the equipment.
[01:12:28.258 --> 01:12:31.581]  Like, if you made that argument to me, I'd be like, well, yes, of course.
[01:12:34.478 --> 01:12:35.359]  I mean, I could be liberal!
[01:12:35.559 --> 01:12:36.541]  I could go there with you!
[01:12:36.561 --> 01:12:39.524]  But it... I grew up this way!
[01:12:39.884 --> 01:12:52.659]  But when it's like, oh, and then what we're going to do is we're going to pass a law for LGBTQ rights so that 24-year-old men can sleep with 14-year-old boys and not have to register as a sex offender because it's just not fair to the gays.
[01:12:52.699 --> 01:12:52.919]  I'm like...
[01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:54.481]  What?
[01:12:55.482 --> 01:12:56.502]  It's what?
[01:12:56.683 --> 01:12:58.044]  Like, I don't know if you saw that one.
[01:12:58.084 --> 01:13:00.666]  That was like, I think early 2020 when they passed that law.
[01:13:00.686 --> 01:13:06.471]  And it's, so I was like, if a 24 year old man touches my 14 year old son.
[01:13:06.491 --> 01:13:06.531]  Oh.
[01:13:07.672 --> 01:13:08.953]  I will get a gun.
[01:13:08.973 --> 01:13:18.961]  That a 12 year old child can be put on off-label cancer drugs.
[01:13:20.353 --> 01:13:23.615]  To irreparably change their body.
[01:13:24.536 --> 01:13:28.538]  Again, if my son came to me and said, Mom, I'm a daughter.
[01:13:28.938 --> 01:13:29.839]  I think I'm trans.
[01:13:29.879 --> 01:13:30.799]  I'd say, okay.
[01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:34.122]  You know, like, you want to dress this way?
[01:13:34.142 --> 01:13:35.362]  You want me to call you?
[01:13:35.382 --> 01:13:37.824]  Whatever the heck you want me to address?
[01:13:37.924 --> 01:13:38.304]  Fine.
[01:13:38.724 --> 01:13:39.385]  Explore it.
[01:13:39.565 --> 01:13:40.285]  I love you.
[01:13:40.305 --> 01:13:41.986]  I'm cool.
[01:13:42.086 --> 01:13:43.828]  Like, do you, as long as we're safe.
[01:13:44.388 --> 01:13:46.869]  But we're not changing your body until it's fully developed.
[01:13:47.170 --> 01:13:47.690]  Exactly.
[01:13:49.628 --> 01:13:50.849]  It's insane!
[01:13:50.869 --> 01:13:55.973]  I just can't, it's madness.
[01:13:56.934 --> 01:13:58.635]  It's madness to me.
[01:13:58.655 --> 01:14:05.200]  I can go on and on and on and it's madness.
[01:14:06.141 --> 01:14:11.004]  Now, what I see here is an opportunity.
[01:14:12.466 --> 01:14:15.328]  And this is why I'm so against political purism.
[01:14:16.810 --> 01:14:19.232]  But let's give you an example of some of this madness.
[01:14:20.393 --> 01:14:21.193]  Let's give you an example.
[01:14:21.313 --> 01:14:37.305]  This is a Venezuelan illegal entry border crosser explaining how our taxpayer dollars are going towards her trans surgery and trans drugs in clip one.
[01:14:38.168 --> 01:14:38.989]  Where are you guys from?
[01:14:39.349 --> 01:14:40.349]  Venezuela.
[01:14:40.509 --> 01:14:42.451]  Did you guys cross the border to come to the United States?
[01:14:42.551 --> 01:14:43.431]  Yes, yes.
[01:14:43.531 --> 01:14:46.633]  Did you change your process here in the United States or before?
[01:14:46.693 --> 01:14:57.980]  When I arrive here in the USA, I can find a doctor, to hormones, to plastic surgeries, all that I need to continue my process.
[01:14:58.381 --> 01:15:00.302]  So did you do all this here in the United States?
[01:15:00.322 --> 01:15:00.562]  Yes.
[01:15:01.162 --> 01:15:03.224]  And did the government pay for you to transition?
[01:15:03.264 --> 01:15:05.305]  Some plastic surgery is...
[01:15:06.908 --> 01:15:09.988]  to cover it for the government.
[01:15:09.988 --> 01:15:24.028]   If you want to go to a doctor, speak with them about whatever you want to make in your body, in your face, breast implants and other tips to practice surgery.
[01:15:24.028 --> 01:15:26.208]  And the government will pay for it?
[01:15:26.208 --> 01:15:33.108]  It's, for me, the only country that the government pays for a plastic surgery.
[01:15:33.042 --> 01:15:40.923]  In Venezuela, for example, the government don't pay absolutely nothing for you.
[01:15:41.524 --> 01:15:44.464]  And it's a benefit for the people trans.
[01:15:46.585 --> 01:15:48.645]  So that's an example of the madness.
[01:15:49.605 --> 01:15:52.586]  In addition to all the things that you heard Jillian Michaels explain.
[01:15:53.286 --> 01:16:02.323]   And so what I see here is a major opportunity and We need to think about how to win.
[01:16:03.984 --> 01:16:09.468]  And this is why I view political purism as a cancer on any political movement.
[01:16:09.688 --> 01:16:12.691]  And we have a real political movement right now behind Donald Trump.
[01:16:12.711 --> 01:16:14.232]  Doesn't mean you're going to agree with everything he says.
[01:16:15.473 --> 01:16:16.173]  Not everything he does.
[01:16:17.715 --> 01:16:25.841]  But to engage in political purism at this point will be a cancer to the Trump movement and we need to think about strategies to win.
[01:16:28.689 --> 01:16:37.513]  And so all, really, we have to do as conservatives is not be insane.
[01:16:38.373 --> 01:16:38.913]  That's really it.
[01:16:38.993 --> 01:16:41.294]  We have to not be insane and not be extreme.
[01:16:42.074 --> 01:16:47.557]  And in a way, we do have to reach to the middle and say, hey, look, we're about common sense.
[01:16:48.037 --> 01:16:49.137]  We're about free market.
[01:16:50.558 --> 01:16:53.319]  We're about prosperity.
[01:16:53.639 --> 01:16:55.020]  We're about the Constitution.
[01:16:56.085 --> 01:17:03.288]  And lay it out like that, because there are a lot of centrists and even liberals that are looking at the left saying, I want nothing to do with this.
[01:17:03.308 --> 01:17:06.350]  I don't identify with this anymore.
[01:17:08.511 --> 01:17:09.671]  Maybe I'm going to look over here.
[01:17:09.991 --> 01:17:16.114]  And if they see people that are political purists and just as nasty and extreme as the left, then we're missing an opportunity.
[01:17:18.052 --> 01:17:19.733]  To actually have political victory.
[01:17:20.913 --> 01:17:21.313]  Who knows?
[01:17:21.953 --> 01:17:34.637]  Maybe in 2024, get the Senate, get the House, and get the White House, and maybe finally get people in there that want to have victory, and want to have conservative policy, and want to have America First policy.
[01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:37.890]  And we might actually see some results.
[01:17:38.531 --> 01:17:57.284]  And even if it's just lowering energy prices, lowering gas prices, lowering your grocery bill, getting rid of regulations, getting rid of taxes, restoring common sense to the classroom, restoring a border to the southern border, why would we pass on this opportunity?
[01:17:59.385 --> 01:18:05.550]  Why would we pass on this opportunity to say, oh, you're a gay woman, I don't want anything to do with you?
[01:18:07.938 --> 01:18:08.198]  Why?
[01:18:08.718 --> 01:18:12.179]  Because the why then becomes because you want to lose.
[01:18:13.799 --> 01:18:14.659]  Because you don't want to win.
[01:18:14.699 --> 01:18:16.920]  Because you don't want to have political victories.
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:24.761]  And you'll complain about losing all day long, and here you have an opportunity to win, and instead you choose to lose.
[01:18:27.701 --> 01:18:28.762]  So that's all you have to do now.
[01:18:29.542 --> 01:18:32.242]  It's the easiest time, actually, to be a conservative politically.
[01:18:32.682 --> 01:18:33.982]  Culturally, whole different story.
[01:18:34.422 --> 01:18:36.163]  You want to be a purist culturally?
[01:18:36.503 --> 01:18:36.903]  Good for you!
[01:18:37.913 --> 01:18:38.553]  No problem there.
[01:18:38.693 --> 01:18:46.257]  That is absolutely a personal choice, and that's what this republic allows you to do, is make your own choices culturally, how you want to live your life.
[01:18:47.437 --> 01:18:58.663]  But we have to win politically, and we need to get as many people to vote with us and align with us politically so that you can preserve your own culture, however you see fit.
[01:18:59.683 --> 01:19:01.404]  So this is a major opportunity.
[01:19:01.604 --> 01:19:05.304]  I'm telling you, I picked two of these videos today.
[01:19:05.304 --> 01:19:09.564]  A woman sitting in her car, a black woman sitting in her car, ranting against Joe Biden.
[01:19:09.564 --> 01:19:14.124]  One of the top fitness influencers ever in Jillian Michaels.
[01:19:14.124 --> 01:19:15.444]  And they're saying the same thing.
[01:19:15.444 --> 01:19:17.124]  The Democrats are a joke.
[01:19:17.124 --> 01:19:18.404]  Joe Biden is a joke.
[01:19:18.404 --> 01:19:20.644]  The American left has gone insane.
[01:19:20.644 --> 01:19:32.844]   All we have to do is just stay sane, stay focused on the populist things like secure borders, the economy, free market, the Bill of Rights, and we can win politically.
[01:19:32.849 --> 01:19:34.911]  And look, if they steal another election, then fine!
[01:19:35.531 --> 01:19:38.954]  It won't be a million or two million Americans that say, hey, the election was stolen.
[01:19:39.314 --> 01:19:41.095]  It'll be 50 million, 100 million!
[01:19:43.036 --> 01:19:44.337]  And then you can see what happens then.
[01:19:47.219 --> 01:19:48.340]  But that's where we're at right now.
[01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:48.700]  Okay.
[01:19:49.381 --> 01:19:52.223]  Here's another thing that they're doing with their straw men.
[01:19:53.163 --> 01:19:53.864]  Oh, oh, oh!
[01:19:57.493 --> 01:20:02.094]  If you don't want gay men getting access to prepubescent boys, then you're a bigot.
[01:20:03.315 --> 01:20:03.835]  Interesting.
[01:20:04.315 --> 01:20:05.375]  What are you really saying?
[01:20:05.875 --> 01:20:09.496]  But it's all these straw man things they put out there to cover for what they're really trying to do.
[01:20:11.057 --> 01:20:21.649]   So they make up this hearing today about Out-of-state abortions or interstate abortions, it doesn't even exist.
[01:20:21.929 --> 01:20:24.431]  It's a made-up concept that doesn't exist.
[01:20:24.451 --> 01:20:27.673]  So they put up this straw man saying, Republicans are trying to take your birth control.
[01:20:27.954 --> 01:20:28.714]  Not happening anywhere.
[01:20:29.615 --> 01:20:32.537]  Republicans are trying to stop you from traveling interstate to get an abortion.
[01:20:32.897 --> 01:20:33.698]  Not happening anywhere.
[01:20:33.758 --> 01:20:39.062]  Here's Mike Lee breaking that down during this fictitious hearing in clip 17.
[01:20:39.303 --> 01:20:41.805]  Thanks so much, Mr. Chairman.
[01:20:45.947 --> 01:20:48.468]  I'm curious about the title of this hearing.
[01:20:49.408 --> 01:20:55.009]  The title of the hearing is, Abortion Bans and Interstate Travel for Care After Doves.
[01:20:57.010 --> 01:21:18.194]   This seems like an attempt to mislead, seriously mislead, the American people into thinking that one or more states are out there criminalizing or otherwise utilizing the coercive force of the state Uh, to prohibit travel to obtain an abortion in another state.
[01:21:19.294 --> 01:21:21.035]  I'm not aware of a single state that's doing that.
[01:21:21.095 --> 01:21:21.635]  Not one.
[01:21:21.715 --> 01:21:23.795]  I'm not aware of a single state that's planning to do it.
[01:21:23.895 --> 01:21:31.058]  Now, the only thing I can think of that it could relate to is minors.
[01:21:31.098 --> 01:21:34.859]  The transportation of minors, underage children.
[01:21:35.856 --> 01:21:37.958]  Across state lines in order to get an abortion.
[01:21:37.998 --> 01:21:54.573]  Which leads me to wonder whether this is really just about the pro-abortion activist community and lobby wanting to allow traffickers and abusers and abortion providers to transport children across state lines without their parents' knowledge or consent in order to get an abortion.
[01:21:56.388 --> 01:21:58.951]  It's a violation of basic standards of decency.
[01:21:59.011 --> 01:22:00.652]  It's a violation of parental rights.
[01:22:00.672 --> 01:22:02.634]  Basic standards of decency, that's what it is right there.
[01:22:02.694 --> 01:22:03.695]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:22:04.495 --> 01:22:05.676]  That's enough from Senator Mike Lee.
[01:22:05.756 --> 01:22:08.218]  It's just, what do they say?
[01:22:08.339 --> 01:22:12.222]  Decency is on the ballot, is what Jill Biden says, is what the Democrats say.
[01:22:12.302 --> 01:22:19.308]  Decency is on the ballot, and these are the most indecent people you've ever met in your life in the Democrat Party right now.
[01:22:21.132 --> 01:22:26.016]  Beyond indecent, just lewd, crude and despicable, even.
[01:22:27.677 --> 01:22:33.542]  I think it's the more apt way of putting it.
[01:22:37.706 --> 01:22:41.649]  And because of that, they're seeing issues with their culture, by the way.
[01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:46.113]  Support for homosexual marriage declining in the United States.
[01:22:48.328 --> 01:22:49.549]  For the first time in like a decade.
[01:22:49.909 --> 01:22:54.613]  Yeah, because at these gay pride parades, they run around naked and gyrating on children.
[01:22:55.053 --> 01:22:57.655]  So, yeah, that'll hurt your cause a little bit, probably.
[01:22:59.156 --> 01:23:01.518]  Homosexual group analyzes how gay states are.
[01:23:02.178 --> 01:23:07.062]  Homosexual organization outleadership, which advocates for the... Buckle up!
[01:23:08.823 --> 01:23:10.925]  LGBTQIAAP2S+.
[01:23:11.145 --> 01:23:24.905]   IAAP2S+ Agenda published their annual business climate index report this month which analyzed how gay each state government is.
[01:23:24.881 --> 01:23:28.204]  And so this is like the ESG, but for gay.
[01:23:28.224 --> 01:23:30.886]  So it's like the ESG is like, oh, are you green energy?
[01:23:31.847 --> 01:23:33.268]  This is like the gay SG.
[01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:36.031]  The gay standard.
[01:23:36.051 --> 01:23:38.093]  It's like, oh, how gay are you?
[01:23:38.273 --> 01:23:40.054]  Are you friendly for the gays?
[01:23:42.516 --> 01:23:43.017]  So you just...
[01:23:45.959 --> 01:23:51.241]  You force this onto people, you force your culture onto people, you force your culture onto their children, and then, oh, what do you know?
[01:23:51.301 --> 01:23:52.241]  They don't like that.
[01:23:52.941 --> 01:23:53.782]  They don't like it.
[01:23:54.562 --> 01:23:54.902]  Do they?
[01:23:56.022 --> 01:24:04.345]  And then you have these pride flag murals painted all over these roads that just continue to get vandalized.
[01:24:04.805 --> 01:24:06.446]  So this is like a common occurrence now.
[01:24:07.722 --> 01:24:13.125]  You have the kids doing it with their electric scooters, so they have to turn off the electric scooters now.
[01:24:13.886 --> 01:24:21.250]  They literally have a red zone and the electric scooters will turn off if you go near the Pride flag.
[01:24:22.110 --> 01:24:30.915]  So now you have in Huntington Beach, the Huntington Pride Street mural, more burnouts on it.
[01:24:30.755 --> 01:24:40.755]  it. Go ahead and show me clip 6 guys. So they tell you, you can't do it.
[01:24:38.843 --> 01:24:44.406]  They tell you you can't do a burnout on a Pride mural.
[01:24:44.466 --> 01:24:46.167]  And so now it just increases.
[01:24:46.227 --> 01:24:47.468]  People are throwing paint on it.
[01:24:47.508 --> 01:24:48.609]  They're doing burnouts on it.
[01:24:48.729 --> 01:24:50.090]  Kids are doing wheelies on it.
[01:24:51.251 --> 01:24:52.652]  So this is probably only going to continue.
[01:24:52.852 --> 01:24:54.172]  And then they say it's a hate crime.
[01:24:55.613 --> 01:24:59.296]  And then they tell you that that's a hate crime.
[01:25:00.597 --> 01:25:02.558]  So burn an American flag, that's free expression.
[01:25:03.953 --> 01:25:13.118]  To face a gay pride flag, a trans pride flag, a pedophile pride flag, and that is a hate crime.
[01:25:15.179 --> 01:25:15.739]  Is what it is.
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:19.081]  So there you go.
[01:25:21.242 --> 01:25:33.188]  By the way, yesterday, well I'll tell you what, we'll go to this kind of comic relief to finish the segment here.
[01:25:34.042 --> 01:25:41.444]  Now Jon Stewart does leftist Democrat propaganda all the time, but even he's making fun of the left now and their deranged Trump coverage.
[01:25:41.544 --> 01:25:43.805]  It may be funny for the first time in years in clip 14.
[01:25:44.025 --> 01:25:47.486]  The news has been pretty bleak recently.
[01:25:48.226 --> 01:25:51.267]  The past two, three hundred years.
[01:25:51.467 --> 01:25:51.727]  Listen!
[01:25:53.588 --> 01:26:01.790]  But this weekend, there was one story that was so disturbing, so dark, even the news couldn't handle it.
[01:26:02.722 --> 01:26:09.367]  In our editorial discussions this morning, we were asked not to show the image from this video because of its violent and disturbing nature.
[01:26:09.527 --> 01:26:12.689]  Video, which we are intentionally choosing not to show you.
[01:26:12.789 --> 01:26:15.711]  We're not going to show because of how disturbing it is.
[01:26:15.731 --> 01:26:18.013]  I was extremely disturbed to see this.
[01:26:18.293 --> 01:26:20.935]  Horrible, horrible, violent imagery.
[01:26:21.095 --> 01:26:22.996]  Violent and dehumanizing imagery.
[01:26:23.036 --> 01:26:25.458]  We're only going to show you a clip of this briefly.
[01:26:25.578 --> 01:26:26.158]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:26:26.178 --> 01:26:26.759]  Let's take it down.
[01:26:31.584 --> 01:26:32.884]  I didn't get to see it at all!
[01:26:34.965 --> 01:26:35.946]  This has got to be devastating.
[01:26:37.667 --> 01:26:41.729]  News channels show images from Ukraine, from Gaza, from natural disasters.
[01:26:42.129 --> 01:26:43.409]  They get through them dispassionately.
[01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:47.932]  I can't imagine how devastating this footage must be.
[01:26:48.592 --> 01:26:58.432]   former president donald trump shared a video this one on his truth social account featuring an image of president joe biden hogtied on the back of a pickup truck
[01:26:58.432 --> 01:27:17.092]   democrats that depict trump being beheaded multiple times killed multiple ways [APPLAUSE]
[01:27:16.785 --> 01:27:19.866]  That's what was so disturbing and dehumanizing.
[01:27:20.527 --> 01:27:22.247]  You wouldn't show it on television.
[01:27:23.368 --> 01:27:26.189]  An airbrushed Biden detail on the back of a truck.
[01:27:27.734 --> 01:27:31.315]  Aren't you the same networks that show reruns of 9-11 every year?
[01:27:31.335 --> 01:27:41.358]  I mean, I don't think it's great that Trump is boasting things like this, but... It's not like people really think Joe Biden was tied up in the back of the truck.
[01:27:42.278 --> 01:27:46.359]  It's a doctored image, but it's plastered on the tailgate of the pickup truck.
[01:27:46.479 --> 01:27:52.021]  So if you're driving behind it, it would appear as if Joe Biden were actually restrained on the vehicle's flatbed.
[01:27:56.918 --> 01:27:57.579]  Oh, man.
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:27:59.740]  Oh, that's funny.
[01:28:04.264 --> 01:28:15.332]  If you think that's really Joe Biden tied up on the back of the pickup truck, I don't know that you have the mental acuity to be operating a motor vehicle.
[01:28:16.883 --> 01:28:17.223]  All right.
[01:28:18.004 --> 01:28:19.585]  But if you do think that, I don't know.
[01:28:19.645 --> 01:28:22.327]  Should John Stewart going to have a change of heart?
[01:28:22.367 --> 01:28:28.292]  Maybe he decides to be funny again and actually use the true comedic value of the modern day left?
[01:28:30.974 --> 01:28:35.418]  I wouldn't bet on it, but we'll get serious again when we come back.
[01:28:35.438 --> 01:28:36.619]  We'll hear from Marjorie Taylor Greene.
[01:28:38.981 --> 01:28:43.124]  All right, I'm going to talk about something that's really central to everybody out there watching and listening.
[01:28:43.144 --> 01:28:45.466]  And when I say this, I'm not lecturing you.
[01:28:46.556 --> 01:28:51.997]  I'm lecturing myself because it's a psychological phenomenon of how tyranny works.
[01:28:52.017 --> 01:28:55.718]  You've all heard of the frog in the pot, and it's a true story.
[01:28:55.998 --> 01:28:58.799]  In Louisiana and Mississippi, they eat a lot of bullfrogs, folks.
[01:28:58.859 --> 01:28:59.219]  I've had them.
[01:28:59.239 --> 01:29:00.039]  They're pretty tasty.
[01:29:00.059 --> 01:29:00.639]  They're fresh.
[01:29:00.999 --> 01:29:04.140]  They're boiled with a little bit of Cajun seasoning.
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:07.240]  If you throw a bullfrog into boiling water, he'll jump out.
[01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:15.362]  If you put him in cold water and slowly turn the heat up, he'll just sit there, and as it gets warm, it gets hot, he passes out, he dies.
[01:29:17.028 --> 01:29:19.429]  So we all know we're in tyranny, those of us that are awake.
[01:29:19.509 --> 01:29:20.049]  Some people don't.
[01:29:20.109 --> 01:29:28.653]  But a large portion of America, I'd say a majority now, overwhelmingly knows we got a corrupt, occupied government that's absolutely at war with us.
[01:29:29.393 --> 01:29:31.073]  But that's not enough to just know it.
[01:29:31.594 --> 01:29:39.697]  And then you can't just get used to whatever the new insane excess is as the tyrants double down and then say, oh sure, we know about it.
[01:29:40.603 --> 01:29:41.604]  And then just accept it.
[01:29:42.445 --> 01:29:44.027]  You've got to speak out against it.
[01:29:44.067 --> 01:29:45.269]  You've got to get upset about it.
[01:29:45.289 --> 01:29:46.130]  You've got to pray about it.
[01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:48.593]  You've got to vote against it.
[01:29:48.633 --> 01:29:50.395]  You've got to support lawsuits against it.
[01:29:50.415 --> 01:29:57.083]  And you've got to back the people in the media and in the government and in the corporations and in the churches and in education.
[01:29:57.836 --> 01:30:00.199]  That are fighting the tyrants, and in medicine.
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:02.162]  We're not in normal times.
[01:30:02.702 --> 01:30:08.069]  And it's not normal to be under this level of oppression, and surveillance, and bullying, and tyranny.
[01:30:08.109 --> 01:30:12.715]  And our enemies, a bunch of criminals, have arrogantly hijacked this country.
[01:30:13.676 --> 01:30:16.560]  And they mistake America's history and its power for their own.
[01:30:17.745 --> 01:30:25.387]  And that's why whistleblowers in the federal government, whistleblowers in big tech, whistleblowers in private industry, in law enforcement, everywhere are so critical.
[01:30:25.807 --> 01:30:27.007]  We've got to kill their ideas.
[01:30:27.307 --> 01:30:28.348]  We've got to expose them.
[01:30:28.728 --> 01:30:30.448]  We've got to remove our support from them.
[01:30:30.468 --> 01:30:32.049]  We've got to get control of our governments.
[01:30:32.469 --> 01:30:37.470]  And then we're not going to imprison and execute these people once they've had due process because we hate them.
[01:30:38.170 --> 01:30:42.732]  We're going to do it because we love the good people of this planet, and we're not going to take it anymore.
[01:30:42.792 --> 01:30:52.695]  But when you see unbridled, psychotic evil by the technocrats and the big corporations unleashed on people, folks, if you're not pissed off, something's wrong with you.
[01:30:52.795 --> 01:30:56.597]  The most dangerous terrorist threat to our homeland is white supremacy.
[01:30:57.177 --> 01:31:00.258]  The most lethal terrorist threat in the homeland.
[01:31:00.598 --> 01:31:01.678]  White supremacists.
[01:31:01.718 --> 01:31:04.099]  The most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today.
[01:31:04.619 --> 01:31:05.960]  White supremacy is terrorism.
[01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:10.733]  We have seen a rise in white supremacy.
[01:31:10.773 --> 01:31:15.137]  The number one threat to this country, domestic terrorism-wise, is white supremacy.
[01:31:15.598 --> 01:31:19.842]  But at the end of the day, folks, the best sports players, anybody, have emotion.
[01:31:21.306 --> 01:31:23.007]  And the best artists have emotion.
[01:31:23.107 --> 01:31:25.128]  And I'm just telling you, I'm really sick of these people.
[01:31:25.528 --> 01:31:31.371]  I've got four children, and I care about humanity, and I like good, decent, wholesome fun.
[01:31:31.691 --> 01:31:35.393]  And man, the people we got running things aren't just evil pedophile jerks.
[01:31:35.733 --> 01:31:37.974]  They really want us eating poison bugs.
[01:31:38.434 --> 01:31:40.675]  They want to take away everything decent.
[01:31:40.695 --> 01:31:41.915]  A nice juicy steak.
[01:31:42.315 --> 01:31:44.116]  They want to take away a nice piece of fish.
[01:31:44.376 --> 01:31:48.077]  They told people during the fake pandemic, don't look at the sun.
[01:31:48.097 --> 01:31:49.317]  Don't look at the sunset.
[01:31:49.357 --> 01:31:50.417]  Don't talk to your neighbors.
[01:31:50.497 --> 01:31:51.217]  All over the place.
[01:31:51.538 --> 01:31:52.678]  Screw these people!
[01:31:53.478 --> 01:31:55.279]  I'm sick of them dictating everything!
[01:31:55.359 --> 01:31:56.619]  I'm tired of their cult!
[01:31:57.299 --> 01:31:58.419]  And I'm not in their cult!
[01:31:58.940 --> 01:32:00.380]  And I want to stop him!
[01:32:00.380 --> 01:32:04.380]  [Music]
[01:32:04.380 --> 01:32:10.380]  [Music]
[01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:12.380]  [Spanish]
[01:32:12.380 --> 01:32:16.380]  What did he just say?
[01:32:16.380 --> 01:32:17.200]  Bye.
[01:32:17.891 --> 01:32:24.381]  He said there's a storm coming in.
[01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:34.280]  I know.
[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:48.280]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:57.280]  [Music]
[01:32:57.755 --> 01:33:04.340]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:04.621 --> 01:33:08.541]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:08.541 --> 01:33:20.381]  Okay, we have fresh footage from Biden at the G7.
[01:33:20.354 --> 01:33:22.575]  It's bad, folks.
[01:33:22.816 --> 01:33:24.237]  He just starts wandering off.
[01:33:26.314 --> 01:33:27.255]  Just starts wandering off.
[01:33:27.495 --> 01:33:29.136]  Go ahead and play this footage.
[01:33:29.196 --> 01:33:29.736]  Just happened.
[01:33:31.357 --> 01:33:37.881]  So, uh, the leaders are there in a group, standing and applauding, and he just wanders away.
[01:33:38.442 --> 01:33:38.882]  There he goes.
[01:33:40.563 --> 01:33:42.824]  There he goes, not knowing what's going on.
[01:33:43.585 --> 01:33:45.866]  Doing hand gestures to an invisible man.
[01:33:46.947 --> 01:33:52.751]  And then Maloney has to get him back in the group, and he goes, oh, oh, oh, over here?
[01:33:54.292 --> 01:33:58.734]  And now I'm going to throw on the Aviators as he's blacking out on his feet.
[01:34:02.636 --> 01:34:04.697]  This is getting real bad.
[01:34:05.057 --> 01:34:20.904]  And you know, it hasn't gotten to the point of the Mitch McConnell moments yet, where Mitch McConnell literally blacks out on his feet, standing in front of the media and just goes completely blank for like 30 seconds and they literally have to carry him off.
[01:34:22.361 --> 01:34:36.604]  It hadn't gotten that bad for Biden yet, but you get the feeling we're nearing an event that will be irredeemable or unrecoverable when it comes to Biden.
[01:34:36.804 --> 01:34:38.824]  I mean, it's inevitable at this point.
[01:34:40.485 --> 01:34:42.685]  The only question is the timing of it.
[01:34:43.906 --> 01:34:45.766]  Will it happen before the first presidential debate?
[01:34:45.806 --> 01:34:47.186]  Will it happen at the presidential debate?
[01:34:47.206 --> 01:34:53.112]   Will it happen before or after they do the Digital nomination.
[01:34:54.792 --> 01:34:55.793]  This is just crazy.
[01:34:56.413 --> 01:34:57.754]  This is just crazy.
[01:34:57.814 --> 01:34:58.094]  All right.
[01:34:58.754 --> 01:35:05.837]  The House has voted to hold Merrick Garland in contempt of court for not releasing the Biden audio.
[01:35:06.598 --> 01:35:07.718]  And let's get something straight here.
[01:35:08.098 --> 01:35:09.439]  And this is one of our biggest problems.
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:11.340]  Congress.
[01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:17.783]  The flow of power goes from Congress to the alphabet bureaucracies, not the other way around.
[01:35:18.976 --> 01:35:23.920]  So there's this new, and this is kind of the way it's handled, and this is like the general understanding.
[01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:26.822]  Most people, if they were asked, hey, who has more power, the FBI or Congress?
[01:35:27.382 --> 01:35:28.243]  They'd probably say the FBI.
[01:35:28.583 --> 01:35:28.963]  No, no, no.
[01:35:29.804 --> 01:35:34.967]  None of these bureaucracies have any power without the consent of Congress.
[01:35:36.048 --> 01:35:45.335]  That's the flow of power in D.C., but somewhere along the way, it's been twisted and contorted, and now these alphabet bureaucracies pretend like they are at the top of the food chain.
[01:35:45.735 --> 01:35:46.396]  Not the case.
[01:35:47.364 --> 01:35:47.904]  Not the case.
[01:35:48.004 --> 01:35:56.947]  And this is a big moment to really see just how distorted the flow of power in Washington, D.C.
[01:35:57.047 --> 01:35:57.187]  is.
[01:35:58.427 --> 01:36:05.929]  So Merrick Garland, held in contempt of court, won't release the audio tapes of the Biden deposition, which Congress told him to, won't do it.
[01:36:06.089 --> 01:36:08.990]  So yep, you're basically committing a crime.
[01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:11.030]  So he's held in contempt.
[01:36:11.110 --> 01:36:13.231]  Here's Marjorie Taylor Greene talking about it in clip 16.
[01:36:16.710 --> 01:36:19.801]  I think you guys referred him to the prosecution.
[01:36:19.861 --> 01:36:22.490]  Well, he should be disputed by the Department of Justice.
[01:36:22.570 --> 01:36:23.212]  He should walk.
[01:36:24.645 --> 01:36:25.486]  Almost certainly won't happen.
[01:36:25.806 --> 01:36:34.855]  Well, if Steve Bannon has been prosecuted and is going to prison soon, if Peter Navarro was prosecuted serving time in prison, is Merrick Garland above the law?
[01:36:35.555 --> 01:36:47.447]  I mean, I thought the whole argument is that no one is above the law and now that we've held him in contempt of Congress, he should be prosecuted by the Department of Justice and he deserves to be the exact same fate as Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon.
[01:36:48.007 --> 01:36:48.407]  Okay.
[01:36:48.487 --> 01:36:55.291]  And then just on the Hunter Biden prosecution, what do you say to folks who say this doesn't show that there's a two-tier justice system?
[01:36:55.391 --> 01:36:56.111]  I'll tell you what.
[01:36:56.151 --> 01:37:02.115]  If they want to prove that there's not a two-tier justice system, then they need to prosecute all the BLM rioters from 2020.
[01:37:03.155 --> 01:37:09.860]  The Antifa rioters, the ones that burned down many cities, caused $2 billion in damages, killed people.
[01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:13.803]  They also need to release the pro-lifers.
[01:37:13.883 --> 01:37:22.809]  I think she's a 76-year-old woman sentenced to two years in prison for peacefully protesting abortion at an abortion clinic.
[01:37:23.769 --> 01:37:33.272]  They didn't put any of the, what about all the people that were threatening the lives of Supreme Court Justices when Roe vs. Wade, right before Roe vs. Wade was overturned.
[01:37:33.292 --> 01:37:38.093]  When the Department of Justice wants to prosecute those people, then we'll start to reconsider.
[01:37:38.313 --> 01:37:44.635]  When they want to actually, okay, hold Merrick Garland, take him in, prosecute him and put him in prison.
[01:37:45.055 --> 01:37:49.757]  Then the American people will start considering maybe there's not a two-tier justice system.
[01:37:49.797 --> 01:38:05.424]  But as far as Hunter Biden's concerned, until Biden's Department of Justice prosecutes him for FARA, as soon as they prosecute him for human sex trafficking, which he is absolutely guilty of, and all the problems with the IRS, then the American people will actually go, you know what?
[01:38:05.724 --> 01:38:07.705]  Maybe there's not a two-tier justice system.
[01:38:08.005 --> 01:38:10.886]  But until then, these petty gun charges are nothing.
[01:38:10.906 --> 01:38:13.308]  Do you think Carlin should be president?
[01:38:14.928 --> 01:38:16.689]  We just held him in contempt of Congress.
[01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:19.510]  They're putting Steve Bannon in prison.
[01:38:19.530 --> 01:38:21.490]  Peter Navarro is in prison.
[01:38:21.591 --> 01:38:24.131]  Merrick Garland evidently deserves to go to prison.
[01:38:26.892 --> 01:38:28.493]  How can you disagree with anything she said?
[01:38:30.494 --> 01:38:31.854]  More Marjorie Taylor Greene's.
[01:38:32.814 --> 01:38:33.995]  Less Dan Crenshaw's.
[01:38:34.215 --> 01:38:35.395]  More Thomas Massey's.
[01:38:35.956 --> 01:38:37.016]  Less Mike Johnson's.
[01:38:38.336 --> 01:38:40.057]  And maybe that's the future of the Republican Party.
[01:38:41.678 --> 01:38:42.658]  I personally think it is.
[01:38:43.885 --> 01:38:45.506]  But we have to have the victories to get there.
[01:38:45.526 --> 01:38:48.768]  We have to have the strategy and the execution to get there.
[01:38:50.770 --> 01:38:58.995]  Now, you want to talk about ironic, and I guess that's more double standard than it is ironic, but there's a level of irony to it.
[01:39:01.177 --> 01:39:11.543]  Merrick Garland thinking he's above the law and the Democrats not holding their own to the same standard that they would hold a Trump supporter to, but Hunter Biden.
[01:39:13.125 --> 01:39:13.565]  Hunter Biden.
[01:39:14.870 --> 01:39:18.091]  is expected to appeal conviction on gun charges.
[01:39:18.191 --> 01:39:28.915]  Now, most of the conservative media, let's say, or Republican-leaning media, has been pretty consistent on this issue.
[01:39:29.355 --> 01:39:35.017]  And that's because we're consistent as conservatives in our politics.
[01:39:35.257 --> 01:39:47.939]   Meaning, if you're a Second Amendment Activist, if you're a Second Amendment hardliner, then you would actually probably be in favor of Hunter Biden's defense here and his appeal here.
[01:39:48.700 --> 01:39:52.841]  But what's amazing is that Hunter Biden, there's two things amazing about this.
[01:39:53.422 --> 01:40:20.483]   Hunter Biden is using language from the NRA, taking script from the NRA in his appeal, And he's using the constitutional grounds of the Second Amendment and essentially appealing laws passed by Democrats, including his own father, Joe Biden.
[01:40:22.865 --> 01:40:25.466]  So Joe Biden is going to be running for gun control laws.
[01:40:26.927 --> 01:40:29.208]  Joe Biden is going to be passing gun legislation.
[01:40:31.377 --> 01:40:52.547]  And they're going to be calling the NRA, you know, all kinds of names, terrorists, whatever, racists, bigots, homophobes, as Hunter Biden is appealing his own father's laws and legislation and using the NRA's own script as the platform, as his strategy.
[01:40:56.128 --> 01:40:59.310]  And don't worry, Democrats will ignore all of this.
[01:41:01.038 --> 01:41:12.884]  Now, for whatever reason, the adult entertainment worker that Hunter Biden knocked up is doing these media tours.
[01:41:13.005 --> 01:41:15.486]  And so she's talking more and more about what Hunter Biden is really like.
[01:41:16.226 --> 01:41:24.811]  Hunter Biden kept drug gear at Joe's Virginia home and slept with members of Amoeba Group, some sex group.
[01:41:29.148 --> 01:41:37.634]  And this is all going on at one of the houses that I guess Joe Biden was storing the illegal classified documents at as well.
[01:41:37.554 --> 01:41:48.413]  And so all these sex workers and drug addicts are going over there.
[01:41:48.413 --> 01:41:49.654]  It's really amazing though.
[01:41:49.654 --> 01:41:51.654]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:41:51.764 --> 01:41:53.465]  Again, you just have to wonder.
[01:41:54.611 --> 01:42:03.957]  With the little Democrat propagandist kid pretending to be a straight white guy saying, you as a straight white man, you like abortion.
[01:42:04.197 --> 01:42:06.919]  You want your wife to kill your kid.
[01:42:08.140 --> 01:42:11.542]  And then Hunter Biden, whatever, you don't want to marry this girl.
[01:42:11.802 --> 01:42:13.884]  Maybe you don't want to see her anymore after you got her pregnant.
[01:42:15.165 --> 01:42:18.286]  But he doesn't even see his daughter.
[01:42:18.766 --> 01:42:20.386]  He doesn't spend time with his daughter.
[01:42:20.466 --> 01:42:21.946]  He wants nothing to do with his daughter.
[01:42:21.966 --> 01:42:23.987]  I mean, who knows?
[01:42:24.047 --> 01:42:25.127]  Maybe it'll come out eventually.
[01:42:26.327 --> 01:42:31.588]  My logic would lead me to believe that he probably told London Roberts to abort his daughter.
[01:42:32.388 --> 01:42:37.209]  Now, she hasn't said that, but it seems like that's likely the case.
[01:42:39.369 --> 01:42:43.030]  And I just... It just shows you who these people are.
[01:42:44.327 --> 01:42:46.208]  It really just shows you who these people are.
[01:42:46.948 --> 01:42:56.973]  So Hunter Biden, a drug addict, sex addict, and look, this isn't to attack people that have addiction problems, but really this wasn't Hunter Biden struggling with addiction, let's be honest.
[01:42:57.353 --> 01:42:59.014]  This was Hunter Biden's lifestyle.
[01:42:59.875 --> 01:43:01.575]  This was a lifestyle choice.
[01:43:02.135 --> 01:43:04.276]  Hunter Biden is a degenerate.
[01:43:04.476 --> 01:43:05.036]  He was.
[01:43:05.136 --> 01:43:05.976]  Maybe he's better now.
[01:43:06.096 --> 01:43:06.376]  I don't know.
[01:43:06.917 --> 01:43:08.517]  Again, I'm not here to judge anybody.
[01:43:08.917 --> 01:43:10.017]  This isn't even a judgment thing.
[01:43:10.197 --> 01:43:11.077]  Let's call it what it is.
[01:43:11.558 --> 01:43:14.138]  Hunter Biden was a degenerate piece of shit.
[01:43:17.599 --> 01:43:18.519]  Just like his father.
[01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:27.001]  And he won't even have anything to do with his own daughter.
[01:43:29.383 --> 01:43:29.703]  Fine.
[01:43:29.783 --> 01:43:32.625]  You don't want to have a relationship with the stripper you knocked up.
[01:43:33.126 --> 01:43:34.547]  You don't want to marry her.
[01:43:34.707 --> 01:43:35.107]  Whatever.
[01:43:35.988 --> 01:43:40.091]  You have your daughter and you want nothing to do with her.
[01:43:42.273 --> 01:43:43.734]  What in the hell is wrong with you?
[01:43:44.555 --> 01:43:45.635]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:43:45.655 --> 01:43:50.479]  This is sickness at a very unhuman level.
[01:43:50.559 --> 01:43:52.160]  It is really unhuman.
[01:43:52.300 --> 01:43:54.002]  That is so unhuman.
[01:43:55.404 --> 01:43:58.686]  For a Democrat propagandist to say, you want to abort your kids.
[01:43:59.287 --> 01:44:03.789]  That is so unhuman for Hunter Biden to not even want to see his own daughter.
[01:44:04.750 --> 01:44:05.831]  You don't even want to see her?
[01:44:08.172 --> 01:44:11.354]  By the way, I mean, it's a beautiful young daughter you have.
[01:44:13.075 --> 01:44:14.276]  And you want nothing to do with her?
[01:44:14.316 --> 01:44:15.397]  You're a sick person.
[01:44:15.437 --> 01:44:17.058]  You are an unhuman.
[01:44:18.699 --> 01:44:20.820]  But that's what the modern-day liberal is.
[01:44:23.922 --> 01:44:27.830]   And then there's John Fetterman, boy this guy's some kind of case.
[01:44:29.071 --> 01:44:30.832]  Look at what he was spotted wearing.
[01:44:32.352 --> 01:44:33.073]  This is a first.
[01:44:33.673 --> 01:44:35.354]  I can really, I don't think this has ever been done.
[01:44:36.034 --> 01:44:41.017]  John Fetterman, spotted wearing, I guess he's recovered from the car accident.
[01:44:41.777 --> 01:44:42.357]  So that's good.
[01:44:44.598 --> 01:44:47.059]  And, but maybe he's suffering more brain damage.
[01:44:47.660 --> 01:44:59.175]   He's wearing a white hoodie, navy blazer on top, And then he just has a tie around his bare neck.
[01:45:03.199 --> 01:45:04.460]  I've never seen this before.
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:05.761]  This is a new look.
[01:45:05.781 --> 01:45:07.423]  Do you think he's making a fashion statement?
[01:45:07.463 --> 01:45:08.904]  Do you think he's just confused?
[01:45:09.164 --> 01:45:09.985]  That's some Epstein.
[01:45:10.766 --> 01:45:13.689]  That's some Epstein throwback right there.
[01:45:14.009 --> 01:45:15.530]  He's making a reference to Epstein?
[01:45:16.031 --> 01:45:18.193]  Well, maybe if the tie was made of toilet paper.
[01:45:19.682 --> 01:45:22.845]  So, this is a look I don't think I've ever seen before.
[01:45:22.925 --> 01:45:25.447]  Who knew Jon Fetterman would be making fashion statements?
[01:45:27.008 --> 01:45:31.231]  I mean, how do you even... Whose idea was that?
[01:45:31.532 --> 01:45:32.613]  Was he confused?
[01:45:33.733 --> 01:45:36.295]  Is he saying, I'm gonna make a fashion statement today?
[01:45:36.115 --> 01:45:50.895]   I was he not choking I've John Fetterman in a white hoodie with a necktie around his bare neck
[01:45:51.581 --> 01:45:53.141]  That is some kind of luck.
[01:45:53.562 --> 01:45:54.542]  Let's see if it catches on.
[01:45:58.203 --> 01:46:05.203]  Let's see if that one catches on.
[01:46:05.203 --> 01:46:09.243]  So there's some back and forth about this decision in Michigan.
[01:46:09.626 --> 01:46:11.187]  I'm going to try to clarify this for you.
[01:46:12.329 --> 01:46:15.533]  Because Democrats and Republicans are both declaring victory.
[01:46:15.993 --> 01:46:17.455]  This is from the Democracy Docket.
[01:46:18.055 --> 01:46:24.402]  Michigan judge largely denies RNC's challenge to absentee ballot signature matching rules.
[01:46:28.207 --> 01:46:36.643]   It's kind of unclear, I mean, the RNC wanted very strict Signature verification rules.
[01:46:36.964 --> 01:46:40.765]  And I guess they're saying the judge didn't give them the strict rules that they wanted.
[01:46:40.965 --> 01:46:50.147]  But the real, I think the real takeaway from this is that in 2020, they basically operated with no signature verification.
[01:46:50.528 --> 01:46:50.828]  None.
[01:46:51.308 --> 01:46:51.868]  None at all.
[01:46:52.728 --> 01:46:54.889]  And, you know, that's probably how they stole Michigan from Trump.
[01:46:55.765 --> 01:47:00.409]  But now the judge has said, no, there does have to be signature verification.
[01:47:01.490 --> 01:47:15.842]  And more importantly, because this is how they got away with it in 2020, was, and I'll see if I can see the exact quote here, but it was basically assumed, yeah, presumption of validity, presumption of validity.
[01:47:16.323 --> 01:47:21.307]  So meaning, if there was no voter signature, they just presumed it to be valid.
[01:47:24.778 --> 01:47:35.007]  So how many presumed valid absentee ballots counted, probably all for Biden, in the 2020 Michigan election?
[01:47:35.908 --> 01:47:40.933]  So the Democrats are declaring victory on this because the RNC didn't have all of its demands met.
[01:47:41.033 --> 01:47:43.775]  But really, forget about that.
[01:47:43.835 --> 01:47:56.510]   The real story here is the Democrats basically Being exposed that they were counting ballots in Michigan that had no signature verification at all.
[01:47:57.030 --> 01:48:00.193]  And they were going with this policy of presumed valid.
[01:48:00.253 --> 01:48:02.895]  That's the actual quote, presumed valid.
[01:48:03.295 --> 01:48:15.484]  So the judge just said, OK, well, we're not going to increase the standards, but we're actually going to enforce the standards that are on the books already, meaning there has to be a voter signature and it does have to be verified.
[01:48:16.164 --> 01:48:18.165]  Which the Democrats broke all those laws in 2020.
[01:48:19.205 --> 01:48:28.268]  And this was the exact type of stuff that they wanted, we wanted, reviewed on January 6th of 2021.
[01:48:28.368 --> 01:48:35.331]  We wanted to look at Michigan and say, hey, you had all these absentee mail-in ballots, was there any signature verification?
[01:48:35.671 --> 01:48:37.431]  And the answer would have been, no!
[01:48:38.612 --> 01:48:41.713]  And then those ballots would have been tossed out!
[01:48:43.952 --> 01:48:45.313]  And think about how this all plays out.
[01:48:46.273 --> 01:48:48.375]  Folks, they're not going to be able to get away with this in 2024.
[01:48:48.935 --> 01:48:49.535]  I'm telling you.
[01:48:50.796 --> 01:48:51.296]  I'm telling you.
[01:48:51.376 --> 01:48:53.317]  They will not be able to get away with this in 2024.
[01:48:54.778 --> 01:48:56.739]  And great job by the crew, they're pulling up some examples here.
[01:48:57.720 --> 01:49:11.720]   So, at 3.30 in the morning in Detroit, Michigan, as Donald Trump is up by 300,000 votes on the morning after the election, Donald Trump up 300,000 votes in Michigan.
[01:49:11.672 --> 01:49:16.957]  At 3.30 in the morning, a truckload of ballots arrives in Detroit.
[01:49:18.219 --> 01:49:23.784]  And it just so happens to be 330,000, and they all happen to go to Joe Biden.
[01:49:26.606 --> 01:49:30.030]  Are those the ballots that weren't signature verified?
[01:49:31.468 --> 01:49:36.789]  Are those the mail-in ballots that went with the presumed valid policy?
[01:49:41.470 --> 01:49:42.710]  That's what we wanted to investigate.
[01:49:42.750 --> 01:49:44.011]  That's what needed to be investigated.
[01:49:44.051 --> 01:49:45.211]  That's what needed to be found out.
[01:49:46.671 --> 01:49:49.072]  And why did the Democrats not want you to look at that?
[01:49:49.132 --> 01:49:50.972]  Why did the Democrats want to stop that?
[01:49:54.213 --> 01:49:58.974]  Because you probably would have seen exactly what we all expect.
[01:49:59.494 --> 01:50:00.334]  Trump won Michigan.
[01:50:01.786 --> 01:50:15.875]  The Biden ballot dump of 330,000 ballots in the dead of night with presumed valid signatures would have canceled those votes and Trump would have won Michigan.
[01:50:16.836 --> 01:50:25.721]  And that same process likely may have happened in Atlanta and in Pennsylvania and in Wisconsin.
[01:50:27.482 --> 01:50:28.463]  But we didn't get that, did we?
[01:50:30.475 --> 01:50:31.528]  We didn't get that.
[01:50:33.473 --> 01:50:39.477]  Alright, this is also, uh, was Kamala Harris the most cringe video of the day, or is this?
[01:50:39.917 --> 01:51:07.024]   So this is the people saying that they want you to have cheap energy now, this is the people saying that they want you to have a free market now, but it's the same Democrats that raise your taxes, raise your regulations, say they want to cancel your gas-powered car, stop you from eating steak, and then they put out this video like they're the pro-energy party here, Cheers to a bright, clean energy future for Massachusetts.
[01:51:06.844 --> 01:51:10.463]   what's the Greenwald, Grafwald, whatever her name is in the Biden administration.
[01:51:10.463 --> 01:51:14.703]  Now they're about promoting energy.
[01:51:14.703 --> 01:51:18.644]   This is the most cringe, probably the most cringe Democrat ad.
[01:51:18.644 --> 01:51:19.484]  I don't know.
[01:51:19.484 --> 01:51:22.184]   You've got three of them today that are all just cringe as it gets.
[01:51:22.184 --> 01:51:23.543]  So, I don't know, you be the judge.
[01:51:23.543 --> 01:51:24.984]  Is this the most cringe one we've seen yet?
[01:51:24.984 --> 01:51:26.144]  Clip five.
[01:51:26.144 --> 01:51:29.743]  Cheers to a bright, clean energy future for Massachusetts.
[01:51:29.743 --> 01:51:32.144]  Cheers to lowering energy costs.
[01:51:32.144 --> 01:51:37.543]   Cheers to great new clean energy jobs for Massachusetts workers.
[01:51:37.574 --> 01:51:39.775]  Cheers to investing in America!
[01:51:40.195 --> 01:51:40.755]  And to beer.
[01:51:42.736 --> 01:51:47.037]  Remember when Elizabeth Warren was in that video?
[01:51:47.117 --> 01:51:48.258]  I'm gonna have me a beer.
[01:51:48.438 --> 01:51:49.658]  I'm gonna have me a beer.
[01:51:49.718 --> 01:51:50.559]  I'm normal like you.
[01:51:50.939 --> 01:51:51.959]  I'm just a normal American.
[01:51:52.019 --> 01:51:52.660]  I like beer.
[01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:55.421]  Give me a break.
[01:51:57.161 --> 01:51:58.082]  Give me a break.
[01:51:58.242 --> 01:51:58.922]  Elizabeth Warren.
[01:51:59.002 --> 01:51:59.922]  I'm gonna have me a beer.
[01:52:00.022 --> 01:52:00.603]  I like beer.
[01:52:00.663 --> 01:52:01.183]  Cheers to beer.
[01:52:01.949 --> 01:52:11.171]  Speaking of aliens, aliens might be living among us disguised as humans or in a base inside the moon according to a new Harvard study.
[01:52:11.231 --> 01:52:12.211]  What in the hell is this?
[01:52:14.372 --> 01:52:25.994]  The study by Harvard's Human Flourishing Program further puts forward the idea that UFOs or UAP may be spaceships visiting Earth's based alien friends that might live on the moon or in the hollow Earth.
[01:52:27.739 --> 01:52:30.040]  Aliens disguised as humans.
[01:52:30.401 --> 01:52:31.781]  I've got a couple leading candidates.
[01:52:32.742 --> 01:52:33.222]  Joe Biden.
[01:52:35.523 --> 01:52:36.324]  Elizabeth Warren.
[01:52:37.685 --> 01:52:39.285]  Rachel Levine.
[01:52:41.166 --> 01:52:42.627]  Who else could we throw on that list?
[01:52:43.868 --> 01:52:45.569]  Aliens disguised as humans.
[01:52:46.249 --> 01:52:46.930]  Hillary Clinton.
[01:52:48.050 --> 01:52:48.410]  Certainly.
[01:52:49.431 --> 01:52:50.432]  Pete Booty Juice.
[01:52:53.773 --> 01:52:54.594]  Quite a few, actually.
[01:52:56.147 --> 01:52:57.388]  Quite a few that it could be.
[01:53:02.231 --> 01:53:08.136]  Here's a human, not alien, Representative Anna Paulina Luna.
[01:53:09.116 --> 01:53:12.699]  You know, this is probably long overdue and this should be bipartisan, but who knows?
[01:53:12.779 --> 01:53:15.041]  Big Food, Big Agra, they control Congress too.
[01:53:16.673 --> 01:53:21.415]  Anna Paulina Luna says, I am introducing legislation today to make our foods less toxic.
[01:53:21.756 --> 01:53:27.118]  Millions of Americans consume poisonous food dyes and sweeteners like high fructose corn syrup daily.
[01:53:27.399 --> 01:53:28.159]  I'm putting an end to that.
[01:53:28.579 --> 01:53:47.471]   I urge my colleagues to join me in this vital legislation, the official press release At the House Government's website, Congresswoman Ana Paulina Luna introduced a legislative package that aims to make Americans' diets healthier by banning certain color additives and high fructose corn syrup.
[01:53:47.952 --> 01:53:56.278]  The Do or Die Act and the Stop Spoonfuls of Fake Sugar Act seek to restrict toxic food dyes like Red Dye No.
[01:53:56.299 --> 01:53:57.079]  40, Yellow No.
[01:53:57.419 --> 01:54:01.303]  5, and 6, and the use of high fructose corn syrup in foods produced in the United States.
[01:54:02.694 --> 01:54:09.459]  These bills amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to classify foods containing these ingredients as adulterated.
[01:54:11.180 --> 01:54:17.505]  It is time we stop allowing unaccountable corporations and the complicit Food and Drug Administration to poison our families.
[01:54:17.905 --> 01:54:30.134]  Far too many Americans are suffering needlessly from type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and mental health conditions as a result of artificial and harmful ingredients that are in nearly every refrigerator and pantry in our country, said Congresswoman Luna.
[01:54:31.263 --> 01:54:40.066]  Not only are we consuming spoonfuls of high fructose corn syrup every day, but many of the foods and snacks we consume have dyes linked to an alarming number of health conditions.
[01:54:40.686 --> 01:54:49.810]  Now, as a small government person, I'd say you need to make your own health decisions and avoid this stuff, like I do.
[01:54:50.910 --> 01:54:52.231]  But I'm certainly not against this bill.
[01:54:52.431 --> 01:55:07.071]   And I think, you know, what's really curious about this, and this is kind of the case study that should be done, On this phenomenon, why in Europe don't they put these poison and harmful ingredients in their food?
[01:55:07.471 --> 01:55:07.731]  Why?
[01:55:08.352 --> 01:55:14.213]  Why if you go to a McDonald's or a grocery store in Europe, same food products, different ingredients.
[01:55:14.573 --> 01:55:15.254]  Why is that?
[01:55:16.094 --> 01:55:22.195]  And of course the results are obvious, you look at obesity in America, diabetes, all the other health problems, there it is.
[01:55:24.884 --> 01:55:26.225]  Again, I'm for small government.
[01:55:26.245 --> 01:55:29.046]  You should make your own health decisions and not consume that stuff.
[01:55:29.626 --> 01:55:31.046]  But I'm certainly for that bill.
[01:55:32.407 --> 01:55:33.367]  And let's see what happens.
[01:55:34.608 --> 01:55:37.029]  Let's see what happens with that.
[01:55:38.297 --> 01:55:45.161]  Okay, we have gotten through most of the news here in the first two hours of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:55:45.201 --> 01:55:52.766]  We have a couple more things coming up from Alex, and as we go into the third hour, I'm going to be opening up the phone lines as well.
[01:55:52.806 --> 01:55:58.409]  We'll take calls in the third hour in what might be one of the final Alex Jones broadcasts ever.
[01:55:58.569 --> 01:55:58.869]  Who knows?
[01:55:58.930 --> 01:56:03.012]  Maybe the final one, depending on how fervent they are in trying to shut this thing down tomorrow.
[01:56:04.393 --> 01:56:07.775]  But we do have a couple more news stories, a couple more video clips, but I am going to come back and give out the phone number.

[01:56:40.266 --> 01:56:43.550]   It's a mystery We do have big discounts going on right now.
[01:56:44.050 --> 01:56:49.492]  I mean, it's not a going-out-of-business sale, but, you know, for all intents and purposes, it basically is.
[01:56:49.572 --> 01:56:52.593]  But we're calling it the Summer Kickoff Sale.
[01:56:52.613 --> 01:57:00.676]  40% off, top-selling, top-rated supplements like DNA Force Plus, like BODY's, like Brain Force Plus, like Brain Force Ultra, like Survival Field X3.
[01:57:01.456 --> 01:57:03.797]  Many of these products, there's nothing else like that on the market.

[02:00:47.854 --> 02:00:50.715]  Talk about how the Democrats want to encourage men to kill their kids.

[02:01:10.623 --> 02:01:16.028]  I'm going to think like three minutes max, but really probably closer to two minutes a caller.
[02:01:16.048 --> 02:01:17.209]  So just really be focused.
[02:01:17.709 --> 02:01:19.510]  When we put you on air, just be ready to go.
[02:01:20.251 --> 02:01:22.173]  And let's hear from as many callers today.
[02:01:24.114 --> 02:01:25.315]  This audience is amazing.
[02:01:25.435 --> 02:01:26.697]  This crew is amazing.
[02:01:26.937 --> 02:01:34.403]  And so I just really want to just lean into all of that in our final moments here, potentially the twilight even, last time you could call in.
[02:01:35.344 --> 02:01:38.867]  First, here's Alex Jones talking about the Merrick Garland contempt.
[02:01:40.222 --> 02:01:50.944]  It comes alongside false claims that a jury verdict in a state trial brought by a local district attorney was somehow controlled by the Justice Department.
[02:01:51.704 --> 02:01:56.205]  That conspiracy theory is an attack on the judicial process itself.
[02:01:56.865 --> 02:02:08.227]  Merrick Garland, the incredibly corrupt head of the Justice Department, who's used it to wage war against President Trump and populists across the country, has now been held in contempt of Congress.
[02:02:08.307 --> 02:02:16.012]   Now, Nobody's ever been charged with contempt of Congress until Steve Bannon, Navarro, and a few others.
[02:02:17.032 --> 02:02:28.639]  But now he is held in a conundrum where if he doesn't prosecute himself, if he doesn't step aside and allow the prosecution of himself as the Attorney General, he is a fraud.
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:31.681]  But he just told Congress two weeks ago, I'm above the law.
[02:02:32.261 --> 02:02:33.622]  I have executive privilege.
[02:02:33.642 --> 02:02:34.763]  I don't even have to testify to you.
[02:02:36.027 --> 02:02:37.128]  So now he's been held in contempt.
[02:02:37.468 --> 02:02:38.789]  This is incredible.
[02:02:38.829 --> 02:02:43.734]  This is them being hoisted on their own petard, as they say, falling into their own pit.
[02:02:44.114 --> 02:02:53.148]   So how does Merrick Garland, the corrupt head of the Justice Department, How does he now not allow himself to be prosecuted?
[02:02:53.148 --> 02:02:57.387]  This is a very, very important question that everybody should be asking right now.
[02:02:57.387 --> 02:03:06.208]   Again, how do you prosecute all these Trump supporters who were members of the Trump administration, who declared executive immunity, but now you declare
[02:03:06.208 --> 02:03:14.967]   executive immunity as the head of the justice department and say, you can't go to jail, as all these Trump supporters are now in prison or reporting to
[02:03:14.967 --> 02:03:16.007]  prison like Steve Bannon.
[02:03:16.273 --> 02:03:17.173]  This is a big deal.
[02:03:17.453 --> 02:03:25.076]  So the question is, will the Attorney General be arrested for contempt of Congress like his political enemies?
[02:03:25.517 --> 02:03:33.160]  Will the Attorney General be fair and step aside and recuse himself now and let one of his little adjuncts throw him in prison?
[02:03:34.110 --> 02:03:34.951]  That's the big question.
[02:03:35.391 --> 02:03:36.873]  I wouldn't hold your breath, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:03:36.893 --> 02:03:37.994]  They don't care about fraud.
[02:03:38.314 --> 02:03:39.015]  They don't care about attorney.
[02:03:39.035 --> 02:03:39.916]  They think you're stupid.
[02:03:40.316 --> 02:03:43.239]  But at least Congress is finally growing some cojones.
[02:03:43.819 --> 02:03:48.924]  We'll cover it all tomorrow live on the big Thursday edition of my show at Real Alex Jones on X.
[02:03:49.770 --> 02:03:50.671]  This is a big deal though.
[02:03:50.911 --> 02:03:51.991]  God bless and good luck.
[02:03:52.532 --> 02:03:59.917]  These repeated attacks on the Justice Department are unprecedented and they are unfounded.
[02:04:00.777 --> 02:04:06.541]  These attacks have not and they will not influence our decision making.
[02:04:07.982 --> 02:04:10.404]  I view contempt as a serious matter.
[02:04:11.254 --> 02:04:19.800]  But I will not jeopardize the ability of our prosecutors and agents to do their jobs effectively in future investigations.
[02:04:22.681 --> 02:04:28.721]   While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:04:28.721 --> 02:04:30.681]  [Explosion]
[02:04:30.681 --> 02:04:39.362]  [Music]
[02:04:39.362 --> 02:04:45.761]   Our political elite want nothing more than for you to be ignorant, deceived, censored, silenced, and rendered useless.
[02:04:45.806 --> 02:04:51.309]  But BrainForce Ultra is a great way to fight back because staying sharp is part of winning the InfoWar.

[02:05:41.702 --> 02:05:47.702]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Owen Troyer.
[02:05:47.867 --> 02:05:51.867]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:51.867 --> 02:06:15.867]  Could be the last opportunity for you to call into The Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:16.325 --> 02:06:19.547]  Lines are already filled, but if you hear somebody hang up, that's your opportunity to get in.
[02:06:20.847 --> 02:06:21.088]  877-789-2539.
[02:06:21.208 --> 02:06:27.913]  And like I said, I mean, I'm going to say probably like three minutes max.
[02:06:28.114 --> 02:06:32.738]  Try to get your call to end with two minutes because I want to take as many callers as possible.
[02:06:32.798 --> 02:06:34.799]  So we're going to be doing rapid fire sessions here.
[02:06:36.501 --> 02:06:39.583]  And let's go ahead and begin with Josh in Alabama.
[02:06:39.644 --> 02:06:41.065]  Josh, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:41.105 --> 02:06:41.505]  Go ahead.
[02:06:43.147 --> 02:06:44.227]  Hey, how you doing, Owen?
[02:06:44.267 --> 02:06:45.849]  I appreciate you taking my call.
[02:06:46.149 --> 02:06:47.050]  I've been listening.
[02:06:47.782 --> 02:06:52.404]  Since about 2015 and Alex Jones has really helped me awaken.
[02:06:53.144 --> 02:07:09.191]  But I just want to put a message out there real quick that things have been going bad and wrong and just now people just now noticing that's sad because I think it's went to a point to where we really need a revolution in this country.
[02:07:09.231 --> 02:07:12.933]  I don't think you know one party is going to be the solution to it.
[02:07:13.433 --> 02:07:21.151]   I'm still not convinced that you know Trump isn't Uh, you know, a mole, a double agent or something.
[02:07:22.072 --> 02:07:24.352]  And it's going to take a lot to convince me otherwise.
[02:07:24.492 --> 02:07:30.174]  But I just want everybody to stay strong and do your own research.
[02:07:30.675 --> 02:07:33.175]  And when the time comes, stand for what's right.
[02:07:33.836 --> 02:07:37.317]  I'd say quit paying your taxes and take your 401ks out.
[02:07:37.397 --> 02:07:39.417]  But, you know, that's just my opinion.
[02:07:41.238 --> 02:07:42.959]  All right, Josh, thank you for calling in today.
[02:07:43.399 --> 02:07:45.339]  Let's go to Kim in Arkansas.
[02:07:45.419 --> 02:07:46.400]  Kim, you're on the air.
[02:07:46.460 --> 02:07:46.780]  Go ahead.
[02:07:48.717 --> 02:07:49.117]  Thank you.
[02:07:49.177 --> 02:07:55.879]  I wanted to say farewell to one of the greatest journalists in America, and I know most of us feel that way.
[02:07:57.400 --> 02:08:00.901]  I wanted to thank you for everything you've done for this country.
[02:08:02.082 --> 02:08:03.842]  I especially want to thank your parents.
[02:08:07.243 --> 02:08:10.344]  They've done something awesome by bringing you into the world, pal.
[02:08:12.025 --> 02:08:13.285]  So we're going to miss you guys.
[02:08:15.757 --> 02:08:18.778]  America wouldn't be America without Alex Jones.
[02:08:19.438 --> 02:08:20.099]  We're still here.
[02:08:20.959 --> 02:08:23.680]  And I see some beautiful things that the Lord is doing.
[02:08:24.661 --> 02:08:27.222]  I don't agree with the fast caller.
[02:08:28.082 --> 02:08:32.083]  I think we have much, much to look forward to.
[02:08:32.884 --> 02:08:38.366]  As God is moving all the chess pieces, He sees every move.
[02:08:39.146 --> 02:08:40.587]  And He's way out in front.
[02:08:40.827 --> 02:08:42.207]  So I wanted to thank you all.
[02:08:42.728 --> 02:08:43.828]  Encourage your audience.
[02:08:45.066 --> 02:08:45.746]  We're gonna win this.
[02:08:47.748 --> 02:08:48.829]  I appreciate that, Kim.
[02:08:49.109 --> 02:08:51.450]  And, you know, let me just be clear about this.
[02:08:54.232 --> 02:08:57.354]  This is, this operation is the mothership in a way.
[02:08:57.414 --> 02:09:10.483]  This operation is like the Millennium Falcon when it comes to legendary status in the fight for truth and piercing through the deception and propaganda that is force-fed to us.
[02:09:10.803 --> 02:09:14.706]  So there's no doubt this is the decommission of essentially the Millennium Falcon.
[02:09:16.698 --> 02:09:18.339]  In that Star Wars analogy.
[02:09:20.300 --> 02:09:31.127]  The real thing that is upsetting about this is I'm not going to be with this crew every day.
[02:09:32.768 --> 02:09:37.331]  I'm not going to have these amazing studios that Alex Jones and this audience built.
[02:09:37.451 --> 02:09:38.292]  The house that you built.
[02:09:39.172 --> 02:09:40.893]  We're not going to have access to that much longer.
[02:09:42.054 --> 02:09:49.525]   No doubt when they do take down this ship This platform that there's going to be a big hit there.
[02:09:49.985 --> 02:09:50.926]  There's going to be a big hit there.
[02:09:51.467 --> 02:09:52.308]  There's no doubt about it.
[02:09:54.009 --> 02:09:54.790]  Having said that.
[02:09:56.892 --> 02:10:03.819]  I think it's very important that we emphasize this and I think it's very important that people understand this because when they first hit InfoWars with the censorship in 2018.
[02:10:06.127 --> 02:10:11.989]  It's not that we weren't properly prepared, because we did have a bunch of mechanisms in place so that we could survive that censorship.
[02:10:12.590 --> 02:10:16.611]  And so then they had to come after us with the lawfare instead, and that's ultimately what's going to take us off air.
[02:10:17.152 --> 02:10:28.116]  But if we could go back and redo it, I wish we would have been more clear saying that InfoWars might be censored off of all the big platforms.
[02:10:28.216 --> 02:10:28.976]  We're still here.
[02:10:29.337 --> 02:10:30.637]  We're still at InfoWars.com.
[02:10:30.997 --> 02:10:32.218]  We're still at Band.Video.
[02:10:32.718 --> 02:10:34.979]  So they will take these platforms.
[02:10:36.169 --> 02:10:44.832]  But you will still find Alex Jones, at the very least on his X account, at RealAlexJones.
[02:10:45.072 --> 02:10:48.394]  So maybe it's important to really emphasize this.
[02:10:50.634 --> 02:10:57.857]  You can still follow Alex Jones and see everything he's going to be doing at RealAlexJones on X. You can still follow me.
[02:10:58.217 --> 02:11:00.258]  I don't plan on stopping broadcasting every day.
[02:11:01.704 --> 02:11:04.628]  I don't know what capacity my show is going to be in, quite frankly.
[02:11:04.648 --> 02:11:07.732]  I just want to finish my duties here before I even talk about it or really think about it.
[02:11:07.772 --> 02:11:14.481]  But to see what I'm going to be doing in the future, you can follow me on X at OwenSchroyer1776 on Rumble.
[02:11:14.841 --> 02:11:16.243]  Rumble.com slash Owen.
[02:11:16.764 --> 02:11:18.005]  Harrison Smith, same thing.
[02:11:19.625 --> 02:11:29.751]  So the real tragedy is I just don't know in what capacity or if any I'm going to be with the crew, what capacity we'll be broadcasting in the future, but we're still going to be there.
[02:11:29.851 --> 02:11:30.992]  We're still going to be there.
[02:11:31.032 --> 02:11:32.773]  We're still going to do everything we normally do.
[02:11:33.193 --> 02:11:35.194]  They're just taking us off the Millennium Falcon.
[02:11:35.214 --> 02:11:39.517]  They're just decommissioning the mothership, decommissioning the Millennium Falcon because it's just been too victorious.
[02:11:39.537 --> 02:11:43.259]  It's just had too many victories against the Deep State.
[02:11:44.904 --> 02:11:46.244]  Against the corruption.
[02:11:46.304 --> 02:11:47.404]  So that's where it's at.
[02:11:47.504 --> 02:11:49.645]  But let's just really emphasize this.
[02:11:50.445 --> 02:11:54.326]  You can continue to follow Alex and what he's going to be doing at Real Alex Jones.
[02:11:54.746 --> 02:12:00.327]  You can continue to follow Owen Schroer and what I'm going to be doing at Owen Schroer 1776 or rumble.com slash Owen.
[02:12:00.707 --> 02:12:02.207]  You can still follow Harrison Smith.
[02:12:02.507 --> 02:12:04.467]  A lot of the crew has ex-accounts too.
[02:12:04.547 --> 02:12:05.488]  You probably follow them.
[02:12:06.108 --> 02:12:06.408]  So.
[02:12:08.648 --> 02:12:10.088]  We are not done.
[02:12:10.128 --> 02:12:11.069]  We're not just going to.
[02:12:11.809 --> 02:12:13.289]  We might go down with this ship.
[02:12:14.383 --> 02:12:16.224]  But we're not dead.
[02:12:17.385 --> 02:12:20.206]  So I would just really want to emphasize that.
[02:12:21.227 --> 02:12:23.568]  So if you do want to still follow Alex's work, you can.
[02:12:23.608 --> 02:12:25.249]  If you do want to still follow my work, you can.
[02:12:25.289 --> 02:12:27.230]  If you do still want to follow Harrison's work, you can.
[02:12:27.270 --> 02:12:34.534]  And hopefully somewhere along the way, maybe we can, you know, build something else with the crew or reunite with the crew.
[02:12:34.814 --> 02:12:35.435]  I don't really know.
[02:12:36.135 --> 02:12:37.756]  But we're not shutting up.
[02:12:39.217 --> 02:12:41.238]  They're taking the Millennium Falcon out of the arena.
[02:12:42.910 --> 02:12:43.811]  But we're not shutting up.
[02:12:44.011 --> 02:12:47.053]  All right, let's go to Mike in Tennessee.
[02:12:47.133 --> 02:12:47.834]  Mike, you're on the air.
[02:12:47.854 --> 02:12:48.234]  Go ahead.
[02:12:50.376 --> 02:12:50.816]  Hey, y'all.
[02:12:50.836 --> 02:12:54.119]  And I just wanted to tell you guys how much I appreciated your show.
[02:12:54.339 --> 02:12:59.043]  I've been watching you guys ever since the Robert Barnes, Nick Fuentes debate.
[02:12:59.963 --> 02:13:02.325]  And, you know, it got me studying the New World Order.
[02:13:02.425 --> 02:13:04.907]  And one time Alex said, call in.
[02:13:04.947 --> 02:13:06.288]  I want to know what's coming next.
[02:13:07.049 --> 02:13:31.683]   And six months before the Israel war, I called in and said, according to the According to the Albert Pike letter, I think that they're going to start a war between Israel and the Muslim world, and just to give you what I think is coming next, is I think, unlike that last caller, I don't think that Trump is a mole, but I do think that his weakness is his Zionism, and they will use that against him.
[02:13:31.803 --> 02:13:36.905]  They'll turn up the heat in that Israel war, and they'll force Trump to support it.
[02:13:37.558 --> 02:13:45.485]  And he's going to have to study his Bible to get his way out of that or get like around guys like Massey and that'll help him.
[02:13:46.106 --> 02:13:48.468]  I want to respond to that real quickly.
[02:13:48.848 --> 02:13:59.377]  Let me respond to that quickly because there's no doubt Donald Trump is very pro-Israel and maybe as far as policy and execution the most pro-Israel president we've had or say even Zionist.
[02:14:01.369 --> 02:14:09.653]  I think that the difference here is, notice how there was less conflicts in the Middle East when Trump was president, and then as soon as Biden got in, all of these things popped off.
[02:14:10.273 --> 02:14:18.297]  I think that's because the rest of the world looks at the leadership of Biden, or lack thereof, and knows that it's basically an empty suit.
[02:14:18.337 --> 02:14:19.297]  There is no leadership.
[02:14:19.778 --> 02:14:38.298]   So they've been doing whatever the hell they want, knowing there's no repercussions from the United States of America, and I'm thinking that Whatever their final agenda is, they're going to try to finish it all off and conclude it before Joe Biden leaves office, should that be the case.
[02:14:38.858 --> 02:14:46.306]  And then when Trump gets back in, maybe they'll stop slaughtering tens of thousands of people, but the land might already be conquered at that point.
[02:14:47.514 --> 02:14:54.034]   and the replacement and the migration of the Palestinians might already be done, but they want to do all of that, and then when Trump gets back in,
[02:14:54.034 --> 02:14:57.074]  I think you'll kind of have some semblance of normalcy and peace again.
[02:14:57.074 --> 02:15:00.934]  So that's kind of how I see that going.
[02:15:00.934 --> 02:15:05.534]  I hope so, because I know that Muslim terrorist attack is coming.
[02:15:05.613 --> 02:15:08.735]  I just don't know if it's before the election or after.
[02:15:08.775 --> 02:15:09.936]  Well, they're going to try to stop it.
[02:15:09.976 --> 02:15:14.318]  That's why they just stopped the, that's why they just arrested those eight potential terrorists.
[02:15:15.379 --> 02:15:19.802]  Uh, because the Biden administration is putting extra pressure on the FBI to make sure it doesn't happen before the election.
[02:15:21.783 --> 02:15:22.003]  All right.
[02:15:22.023 --> 02:15:23.444]  And I just got one last question.
[02:15:23.804 --> 02:15:26.365]  Um, I sent you a copy of my book when you were in prison.
[02:15:26.405 --> 02:15:29.267]  I don't know if it was one of the 15 that you got a chance to read.
[02:15:29.607 --> 02:15:30.568]  Armageddon Deception?
[02:15:32.313 --> 02:15:36.836]  No, I don't think I read that one, but I'm sure I still have it if they didn't send it back.
[02:15:38.517 --> 02:15:41.219]  All right, it covers this Muslim terror cell that's coming.
[02:15:42.179 --> 02:15:44.361]  Did you write multiple books?
[02:15:44.421 --> 02:15:46.642]  A couple authors sent me their books, and they sent me multiple books.
[02:15:46.662 --> 02:15:48.223]  Did you just send me the one or multiple books?
[02:15:50.104 --> 02:15:50.444]  Just one.
[02:15:50.504 --> 02:15:55.227]  It's called Armageddon Deception, the Eschatology of Islam and Zionism.
[02:15:55.507 --> 02:16:05.581]   And I kind of show how the Rothschilds have been funding Zionism Ever since 1830, and that's why you have so many of these conservative Christians, but they're Zionists.
[02:16:06.241 --> 02:16:10.044]  And they're allowed in the government because they push pro-Israel stuff.
[02:16:10.444 --> 02:16:14.747]  It's because they don't understand the scriptures and what modern Israel is.
[02:16:15.368 --> 02:16:19.591]  And I know you and Stu Peters came close to broaching that conversation.
[02:16:19.611 --> 02:16:27.937]  I hope maybe someday I can be a guest on your show and we can really dig deeper into that particular topic, because it's really important.
[02:16:28.615 --> 02:16:34.156]  Well, there's no doubt they're trying to sabotage America with this centuries-old holy war.
[02:16:35.036 --> 02:16:51.980]  And that's why now they're going to bring a bunch of Palestinians over here, they're going to put them in New York, and if they accomplish this goal, I mean, if you think it's bad now, folks, when you put Palestinians and Jews on the same street corner in New York City, I mean, it's all being done intentionally.
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:53.240]  Alright, thank you for the call.
[02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:57.041]  Let's go to Tara in Alabama.
[02:16:57.101 --> 02:16:58.281]  Tara, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:17:00.441 --> 02:17:01.581]  Hey Owen, how are you?
[02:17:01.601 --> 02:17:03.142]  I hope you can hear me, I'm at work.
[02:17:03.262 --> 02:17:04.022]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:17:04.362 --> 02:17:08.484]  I just wanted to give you some love, you know, because I haven't got to talk to you yet.
[02:17:09.024 --> 02:17:19.448]  I've been listening to Alex Jones for about the last 10 years now and I just, I have a lot of respect for you guys because I've noticed you have some differing opinions from Alex and I respect that.
[02:17:19.508 --> 02:17:24.569]  You're not the Daily Wire, you don't get rid of your people because you don't all walk and talk the same way.
[02:17:24.589 --> 02:17:26.310]  We don't send spies after people?
[02:17:28.058 --> 02:17:30.540]  Yes, and I love that about you guys.
[02:17:30.940 --> 02:17:37.126]  And I wanted to ask you how you feel about those Russian warships, because I actually have a baby due November 6th.
[02:17:37.186 --> 02:17:38.026]  Congratulations.
[02:17:38.066 --> 02:17:38.947]  And I'm just terrified.
[02:17:39.007 --> 02:17:45.052]  Now Russia, thank you, Russia's held restraint, and I appreciate that out of them.
[02:17:45.132 --> 02:17:52.678]  And all of these, you know, right-wing elections that we're winning in Europe brings me hope that some of them are going to back away from this war.
[02:17:53.219 --> 02:17:56.842]  So do you feel like maybe Russia will kind of hold restraint?
[02:17:57.466 --> 02:17:59.747]  Or do you think that I need to be concerned?
[02:17:59.827 --> 02:18:02.769]  Well, alright, I'm ready for this question.
[02:18:02.849 --> 02:18:12.213]  So, first of all, you recognize something that the American media and, quite frankly, our politicians want you to be fooled on, and that is Vladimir Putin's restraint.
[02:18:13.614 --> 02:18:22.718]  And, I mean, just, you know, because you have to put these little additives into everything now, but this isn't an endorsement of Putin.
[02:18:22.778 --> 02:18:24.119]  I mean, maybe I like Putin, maybe I don't.
[02:18:24.219 --> 02:18:24.979]  This is just the fact.
[02:18:27.165 --> 02:18:33.133]  Vladimir Putin's restraint and level-headedness, the American people should be grateful for.
[02:18:33.814 --> 02:18:41.645]  We should be extremely grateful that Vladimir Putin is level-headed and has remained the steady hand in all of this.
[02:18:42.086 --> 02:18:43.267]  And look, it makes sense.
[02:18:44.110 --> 02:18:53.041]  He's pulled Russia out of the remnants of communism for decades to get them to this point and so he doesn't want to throw it all away with a nuclear war.
[02:18:53.121 --> 02:18:54.703]  I don't think Russia wants a nuclear war.
[02:18:55.304 --> 02:18:58.108]  I think this is more about symbolism than anything.
[02:18:58.128 --> 02:19:02.673]  I think this is more about symbolism and saying if you're going to put...
[02:19:03.462 --> 02:19:11.169]  These missiles on our border, and if you're going to bring NATO into our territory as we see it, then how do you like it?
[02:19:11.209 --> 02:19:17.815]  How do you like us being in Cuba with hypersonic missiles and nuclear-capable submarines and running drills?
[02:19:18.195 --> 02:19:19.756]  So I think it's a little bit more than that.
[02:19:19.776 --> 02:19:22.879]  I think that's basically what it is.
[02:19:24.636 --> 02:19:25.997]  Putin wants a nuclear war.
[02:19:26.057 --> 02:19:36.062]  Now, the balancing act is the Pentagon and the State Department and the CIA and, yeah, I guess the White House, but they don't know what's going on.
[02:19:36.422 --> 02:19:47.247]  The balancing act is how much money can they launder, how many, how much weapons can they launder and not push Russia over the edge.
[02:19:47.567 --> 02:19:50.049]  And so that's kind of the balancing act.
[02:19:51.764 --> 02:20:02.535]  Again, I do believe Trump getting back into office kind of solves the worst of these problems, maybe not all the problems, but certainly the worst of them when it comes to geopolitical tensions.
[02:20:06.068 --> 02:20:14.355]  You know, this is the modern day Cuban Missile Crisis, the only difference being the American media won't report on it because it's a really bad look for Joe Biden.
[02:20:14.915 --> 02:20:20.199]  But, oh, they'll tell you Russia, boogeyman, interfering in elections, you know, meddling with Trump and all this stuff.
[02:20:20.239 --> 02:20:24.863]  And then they have missiles going in our, right in our airspace, basically, and they say nothing about it.
[02:20:24.903 --> 02:20:25.843]  Tara, thank you for the call.
[02:20:26.364 --> 02:20:27.985]  Let's go to Dave in Arizona.
[02:20:28.025 --> 02:20:28.726]  Dave, you're on the air.
[02:20:28.746 --> 02:20:29.126]  Go ahead.
[02:20:31.288 --> 02:20:31.988]  Thanks so much, sir.
[02:20:32.869 --> 02:20:35.531]  After my point, I'd like to get your suggestions on hacks.
[02:20:36.235 --> 02:20:56.133]  Yes, but my point is, with all this stuff with Garland, I think it's all performative art, and it's thrown out there as red meat for the people that watch FAUX News, Fox News, because we know that the gelded old pathetic GOP party, gelded old and pathetic, doesn't stand for We the People.
[02:20:56.873 --> 02:20:58.515]  They are complicit.
[02:20:59.236 --> 02:21:02.437]  A hundred percent in this contra-revolutionary war.
[02:21:02.757 --> 02:21:06.098]  And we know it from the J6 political prisoners, yourself included.
[02:21:06.938 --> 02:21:07.878]  Who stood up for them?
[02:21:07.898 --> 02:21:13.080]  I mean, they're standing up for Bannon now after they watched Peter Navarro sit in jail for four months?
[02:21:13.100 --> 02:21:14.340]  It's ridiculous.
[02:21:14.420 --> 02:21:15.560]  It's all performative art.
[02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:20.021]  And I just hope we, the people, wake up faster than we have been, sir.
[02:21:20.421 --> 02:21:22.662]  I appreciate all you're doing on the channel.
[02:21:23.062 --> 02:21:25.763]  I'm new to the platform, but I've followed the message for quite a while.
[02:21:25.803 --> 02:21:26.083]  Thank you.
[02:21:27.011 --> 02:21:27.671]  Thank you for the call.
[02:21:28.432 --> 02:21:32.414]  There's no reason to believe otherwise, that it's not just performative.
[02:21:33.254 --> 02:21:37.617]  I would say, give them a shot, just to see if they follow through with this.
[02:21:39.017 --> 02:21:54.406]  Now, having said that, because we can be negative about the GOP all day long, and it's not that they don't deserve that, but I also see a hostile takeover of the GOP, and I also see that the future of the GOP is a lot different than the present status of the GOP.
[02:21:55.738 --> 02:22:04.703]  And so, I mean, really, four years ago or eight years ago or ten years ago, whatever, the GOP wouldn't have done any of this.
[02:22:04.743 --> 02:22:06.504]  They wouldn't even have thrown you the red meat.
[02:22:07.345 --> 02:22:09.606]  So, I mean, we are kind of gaining ground.
[02:22:09.806 --> 02:22:19.408]   And I really do believe that there is a political takeover of the GOP and that the old guard right is Is almost gone.
[02:22:19.448 --> 02:22:20.229]  It's fading.
[02:22:20.809 --> 02:22:23.390]  And the new guard right, which expects results.
[02:22:24.110 --> 02:22:26.911]  We don't want you to just say you're going to hold him in contempt.
[02:22:27.191 --> 02:22:30.192]  We want you to do it and put him in jail if that's what you're all about.
[02:22:30.893 --> 02:22:38.375]  But that's, we might still be two years or four years away from that kind of activation in the GOP.
[02:22:38.395 --> 02:22:39.916]  But you see the candidates rising.
[02:22:41.224 --> 02:22:44.065]  You see some of the representatives like Marjorie Taylor Greene getting in there.
[02:22:44.145 --> 02:22:49.487]  I mean, even Trump to an extent is a representation of this, but he's kind of the last dying breath of the old guard GOP.
[02:22:50.107 --> 02:22:53.648]  If you look at like Trump Jr., maybe for an example, Trump Jr.
[02:22:53.728 --> 02:22:55.969]  is much more hardcore than even his father.
[02:22:56.869 --> 02:22:58.770]  So that's like, to me, like the new guard.
[02:22:58.790 --> 02:23:00.551]  And I don't know if he has any political aspirations.
[02:23:00.611 --> 02:23:01.591]  He denies he does.
[02:23:02.851 --> 02:23:04.552]  But to me, that's kind of the phenomenon we're witnessing.
[02:23:04.572 --> 02:23:09.253]  All right, let's go to George in California.
[02:23:09.314 --> 02:23:10.154]  George, you're on the air.
[02:23:10.174 --> 02:23:10.534]  Go ahead.
[02:23:13.075 --> 02:23:14.856]  My brother, how is the audio quality?
[02:23:14.876 --> 02:23:15.356]  You're good.
[02:23:17.037 --> 02:23:17.477]  All right.
[02:23:17.857 --> 02:23:20.538]  As I always start off, God bless you and the crew.
[02:23:21.398 --> 02:23:23.319]  My appreciation always to you guys, man.
[02:23:23.539 --> 02:23:26.300]  I did that video production in high school.
[02:23:26.340 --> 02:23:27.460]  That stuff is not easy.
[02:23:27.620 --> 02:23:29.461]  You guys do an amazing job every day.
[02:23:32.402 --> 02:23:42.306]  Going back to Harrison this morning, man, your resident Armenian InfoWarrior calling in from California here in the Central Valley.
[02:23:43.052 --> 02:23:45.174]  He had that clip of Candace on there.
[02:23:45.414 --> 02:23:49.358]  Candace Owens, when she mentioned Armenia three times, I clocked it, man, three times.
[02:23:49.678 --> 02:23:56.124]  She brought it up and I guarantee you every, gosh, let's say it this way.
[02:23:56.404 --> 02:24:12.916]   Every hanging weakness in Glendale and North Hollywood instantly got a hard on being someone talk about it, mentioning our tiny little country because Just like her, you folks always bring to light the things that people don't talk about.
[02:24:13.316 --> 02:24:14.117]  That's important.
[02:24:14.477 --> 02:24:23.242]  And I'm not here just bringing my country up into this, but it's the double standard, the two-sided thing.
[02:24:23.703 --> 02:24:31.547]  They always say Israel's got a right to defend itself when they're funding, you know, mass killings of Armenians by the Azeris and Turks over there.
[02:24:31.567 --> 02:24:33.168]  Stuff doesn't make sense.
[02:24:33.469 --> 02:24:35.009]  You guys have always done a great job.
[02:24:36.230 --> 02:24:37.091]  Always listen to you.
[02:24:39.733 --> 02:24:41.334]  Unfortunately, today's my birthday, brother.
[02:24:41.354 --> 02:24:50.298]  I call in, I always mention you and I are the same age, and you and my mom share a birthday, but you're the better version of me.
[02:24:50.438 --> 02:24:52.279]  Did you say today was your birthday?
[02:24:53.760 --> 02:24:54.940]  Today's my birthday, brother.
[02:24:54.960 --> 02:24:56.301]  I turned 35 today.
[02:24:56.861 --> 02:24:57.562]  Happy birthday.
[02:24:59.783 --> 02:25:00.323]  Thank you, man.
[02:25:01.083 --> 02:25:03.545]  Well, let me respond to that, and thank you for the call.
[02:25:03.585 --> 02:25:04.245]  I'm glad you got in.
[02:25:05.526 --> 02:25:06.526]  Just briefly respond.
[02:25:07.867 --> 02:25:22.011]  I mean, you pretty much laid it all out, but what bothers me is how we pick and choose which foreign conflicts or genocides or atrocities that we care about.
[02:25:22.391 --> 02:25:24.372]  And it's usually politically motivated.
[02:25:25.572 --> 02:25:27.713]  And so I'll just leave it at that.
[02:25:28.433 --> 02:25:30.954]  Let's go to Timothy Lassley calling in.
[02:25:32.332 --> 02:25:33.472]  From Seattle, I'm guessing.
[02:25:33.512 --> 02:25:33.813]  Who knows?
[02:25:33.833 --> 02:25:38.234]  He might be outside the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation right now, giving them the what for.
[02:25:38.854 --> 02:25:39.494]  Tim, go ahead.
[02:25:41.275 --> 02:25:54.219]  No, I'm not at the Gates Foundation, but I'm working and I just wanted to express my gratitude for all of your effort, all of your compassion for humanity, all the lives that you've saved, all through the course of history.
[02:25:54.860 --> 02:25:57.420]  So, just keep on.
[02:25:57.821 --> 02:25:59.101]  I mean, I love you guys.
[02:25:59.521 --> 02:26:00.942]  And I don't think you're going to be defeated.
[02:26:00.982 --> 02:26:02.899]   I think you guys are going to Thank you, Timothy.
[02:26:02.919 --> 02:26:04.661]  Lastly, let's go to Bart in Missouri.
[02:26:04.701 --> 02:26:06.182]  Bart, you're on the air.
[02:26:06.141 --> 02:26:13.262]   we're destroyed in a daily basis but then we rebuild ourselves at night and so I expect you guys to do the exact same thing we've always done is just
[02:26:13.262 --> 02:26:17.381]  kick ass for America and the rest of humanity. God bless them for worse.
[02:26:17.381 --> 02:26:26.742]   Thank you Timothy. Lastly let's go to Bart in Missouri. Bart you're on the air go ahead. Yes sir.
[02:26:25.182 --> 02:26:37.510]  For the last 11 years, I just want to say that InfoWars, your show, Alex Jones, Harrison Smith, and everybody else has made my—this has been the best part of my life, and it feels like death to me.
[02:26:37.530 --> 02:26:40.692]  And I just want to say, never give up.
[02:26:40.992 --> 02:26:41.873]  That's all I can say.
[02:26:41.893 --> 02:26:41.873]  1776.
[02:26:45.715 --> 02:26:46.536]  You have my word.
[02:26:47.116 --> 02:26:47.837]  You have my word.
[02:26:47.897 --> 02:26:49.618]  Let's go to Sue in Michigan.
[02:26:50.038 --> 02:26:50.879]  Sue, you're on the air.
[02:26:50.919 --> 02:26:51.279]  Go ahead.
[02:26:55.928 --> 02:26:56.408]  Hi, Owen.
[02:26:56.689 --> 02:27:03.333]  I just wanted to say that the left has been monopolizing women and their vote for the past 20 years.
[02:27:03.653 --> 02:27:13.580]  And notice the health care, schools, banking, retail is where the IT services are and that they want to head into.
[02:27:13.640 --> 02:27:17.163]  So I think they're really after the women and their jobs.
[02:27:17.463 --> 02:27:19.764]  And it's just a bad thing.
[02:27:19.844 --> 02:27:25.950]   And we need to pay attention to that and start pointing out to women the whole Well, how do we do that?
[02:27:26.171 --> 02:27:36.499]  I mean, you look at voting patterns and the majority of women do vote liberal, specifically single or divorced women vote liberal, mostly single women, young women.
[02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:39.441]  I mean, how do we change that?
[02:27:40.962 --> 02:27:49.009]  We have to get out there and show them, like all of them, they tried to make them out as heroes, but they made them out to look like idiots.
[02:27:49.729 --> 02:27:51.851]  They are going to take their jobs.
[02:27:52.954 --> 02:27:59.937]  All the places that IT is going, and they want to move in robots, and all those women will lose jobs.
[02:28:00.457 --> 02:28:05.278]  If they start understanding that, including the food and retail services... You think that resonates with women?
[02:28:06.839 --> 02:28:07.899]  You better believe it.
[02:28:07.939 --> 02:28:10.800]  Those women like their money, and they like their shopping.
[02:28:10.840 --> 02:28:12.241]  We control the money.
[02:28:12.421 --> 02:28:17.823]  The left believes that it's abortion that resonates with women, and they've been able to get the political results out of it.
[02:28:19.514 --> 02:28:21.476]  Right, we need to tell them don't abort.
[02:28:22.056 --> 02:28:24.339]  You don't throw the water out with the baby.
[02:28:25.139 --> 02:28:26.561]  You don't abort your job.
[02:28:26.721 --> 02:28:28.823]  Don't abort your political capital.
[02:28:29.423 --> 02:28:30.284]  You've got to get out there.
[02:28:30.304 --> 02:28:33.527]  The left has dominated the female vote and it really is over the abortion issue.
[02:28:33.547 --> 02:28:34.688]  But they get lied to about it.
[02:28:34.728 --> 02:28:36.070]  Most of them don't even have abortions anyway.
[02:28:39.226 --> 02:28:40.847]  Let's go to Nurse Keith in Oregon.
[02:28:40.887 --> 02:28:41.407]  You're on the air.
[02:28:41.447 --> 02:28:42.348]  Welcome and thanks for holding.
[02:28:42.708 --> 02:28:53.054]  About an hour ago, you were kind of explaining to people about how the micronutrients and stuff that are available and different foods actually have an effect on... Well, let's be clear.
[02:28:53.074 --> 02:28:55.556]  There isn't long-term billion-year evolution.
[02:28:55.915 --> 02:29:09.995]   there's jumps but like how you build a car. Cars have evolved or electricity or computers have changed. There is innovation and humans do get ancestral memories from their ancestors. That's
[02:29:09.995 --> 02:29:23.036]   called instincts. Yes. I'm not trying to brag but I'm a board certified wound care associate which is not an easy certification to get. It takes years and it encompasses you know cardiology,
[02:29:23.036 --> 02:29:25.036]  and the current home area.
[02:29:24.888 --> 02:29:27.808]  You name it, you've got to be good at all kinds of stuff.
[02:29:27.808 --> 02:29:31.688]   And let's face it, a lot of my doctors, they don't know anything about this stuff.
[02:29:31.688 --> 02:29:35.128]  It's my job as a nurse to figure it out and--
[02:29:35.128 --> 02:29:39.448]   The average medical doctor gets two hours of college education on nutrition.
[02:29:39.448 --> 02:29:50.068]   So one of the things that I do is I'm looking for results and by using very good nutraceuticals
[02:29:50.068 --> 02:29:54.752]   and supplements and things like that, I can fix a problem.
[02:29:54.892 --> 02:29:55.952]  Just a real quick example.
[02:29:55.992 --> 02:30:02.313]  Let's say you have a really bad wound on your leg and you have diabetes and poor circulation.
[02:30:02.413 --> 02:30:13.764]   Well, I can order you a bottle of Nitric Boost, a bottle of BezoBeat, and Get your ass up on a treadmill a little bit.
[02:30:14.225 --> 02:30:18.553]  And these things work better than any of the medication that we give.
[02:30:19.292 --> 02:30:24.416]  So I've got about 35,000 points because I gave these things away as gifts.
[02:30:24.756 --> 02:30:25.357]  Hold on, hold on.
[02:30:25.377 --> 02:30:26.177]  This is important.
[02:30:26.218 --> 02:30:27.599]  This is important, absolutely.
[02:30:28.079 --> 02:30:30.861]  Just iodine alone, it's essential.
[02:30:30.881 --> 02:30:31.682]  It means you die without it.
[02:30:31.702 --> 02:30:33.243]  They don't tell you most people are deficient.
[02:30:33.563 --> 02:30:35.645]  Two billion people have cognitive disabilities, the UN admits.
[02:30:35.885 --> 02:30:39.048]  That's what these concentrated plants and other compounds do.
[02:30:39.428 --> 02:30:44.531]   So you're saying you're taking care of people with wounds, one of the biggest Medical industry's out there, super tough job.
[02:30:44.851 --> 02:30:48.312]  You're seeing with nutrition and also they need to not be sedentary, obviously.
[02:30:48.752 --> 02:31:00.797]  You're seeing massive effects, because I've actually read about this, I'm not an expert like you, but that there's massive problems because the doctors don't even say exercise or get out of the bed or take supplements that are good for your skin.
[02:31:00.817 --> 02:31:02.198]  And it's so simple.
[02:31:02.278 --> 02:31:06.759]  I mean, my wife takes supplements to have good hair and good nails and it really works for her.
[02:31:06.879 --> 02:31:07.980]  I mean, this stuff works.
[02:31:08.060 --> 02:31:08.980]  It's the compounds.
[02:31:09.320 --> 02:31:10.761]  Tell people about some of the things you've witnessed.
[02:31:11.281 --> 02:31:17.503]  Alex, I would not have 35,000 Patriot Points if this stuff didn't work.
[02:31:17.623 --> 02:31:20.845]  I'm not into buying BS and I don't push BS.
[02:31:21.545 --> 02:31:32.894]   When I've got a complex wound and I see something that you guys sell that I know We can sell the stuff Walmart sells, synthetic stuff, and the bottle costs more than what they're selling.
[02:31:33.314 --> 02:31:37.496]  With us, these products, some of these products are costing us $30 a bottle, like DNA Force, okay?
[02:31:37.355 --> 02:31:38.495]  even in the fake game.
[02:31:38.495 --> 02:31:40.575]  The stuff that you guys sell is legit.
[02:31:40.575 --> 02:31:45.695]   We can sell the stuff Walmart sells, synthetic stuff, and the bottle costs more than what they're selling.
[02:31:45.695 --> 02:31:51.615]   With us, these products, some of these products are costing us $30 a bottle, like DNA Force, okay?
[02:31:51.615 --> 02:31:55.056]  I mean, so there's cost because it is the highest rated.
[02:31:55.056 --> 02:32:00.296]   If you're taking a nitrate, like you were talking about the nitrate boost, boom,
[02:32:00.296 --> 02:32:02.775]  that is gonna vasodilate.
[02:32:03.251 --> 02:32:07.696]  So when you're vasodilated, yeah, you're going to be pitching a proper ten.
[02:32:08.037 --> 02:32:09.679]  The vasobeat does the exact same thing.
[02:32:10.100 --> 02:32:13.304]  But it also helps if I've got a person who's got really poor perfusion.
[02:32:14.185 --> 02:32:20.350]  And I just want to get their blood flow going so that I can keep this wound from going septic and actually get some granulation going.
[02:32:20.891 --> 02:32:22.752]  Or I could throw all the medications at it.
[02:32:22.793 --> 02:32:24.274]  It's not going to do a damn thing.
[02:32:24.614 --> 02:32:29.919]  The doctors see the patient for 10 minutes, write a prescription and say, okay, come back in 45 days.
[02:32:30.259 --> 02:32:32.120]  And it's my job to actually go figure it out.
[02:32:32.341 --> 02:32:34.863]  And so I use a lot of the stuff that you guys have.
[02:32:35.163 --> 02:32:37.025]  Thank you so much and God bless you, Nurse Keith.
[02:32:37.065 --> 02:32:37.605]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:32:37.625 --> 02:32:38.206]  Give us your name and number.
[02:32:40.297 --> 02:33:01.537]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones Live from the Infowars.com studios
[02:33:01.537 --> 02:33:10.397]   You're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host Owen Troyer I got something.
[02:33:10.784 --> 02:33:18.589]  I'm not sure there will ever be anything like InfoWars ever again.
[02:33:18.609 --> 02:33:21.852]  Let's just be honest.
[02:33:22.332 --> 02:33:27.056]  The decades of work, the great crew, the audience, the guests.
[02:33:30.338 --> 02:33:32.320]  I don't know if anything like this will ever exist again.
[02:33:35.342 --> 02:33:39.265]  But in a way, in the twilight here, perhaps the closure is the final victory.
[02:33:42.423 --> 02:33:43.783]  Maybe that's the story.
[02:33:44.864 --> 02:33:46.804]  Alright, we're getting the phone lines back loaded up here.
[02:33:46.984 --> 02:33:47.924]  Couple other things to cover.
[02:33:51.425 --> 02:34:01.287]  Leticia James, Tish James they say, New York Attorney General, threatened doctors that were writing out prescriptions for ivermectin to treat COVID patients.
[02:34:02.408 --> 02:34:05.408]  And she's actually acquired one of the letters that was sent to a doctor.
[02:34:05.488 --> 02:34:08.229]  She's, Brianna Morello that is, has published it.
[02:34:09.341 --> 02:34:15.123]  On her ex-account, she was threatening people for prescribing a remedy.
[02:34:15.383 --> 02:34:15.823]  And it was.
[02:34:16.183 --> 02:34:18.284]  Ivermectin proved to work against COVID.
[02:34:18.704 --> 02:34:25.445]  And Letitia James was stopping doctors from helping people heal from COVID.
[02:34:25.465 --> 02:34:27.966]  I mean, if that's not as evil as it gets.
[02:34:28.646 --> 02:34:33.268]  And let me tell ya, I don't even know...
[02:34:34.997 --> 02:34:43.978]  I don't know if I want to talk about this, maybe Alex will talk about it, but, I mean, let's just say Letitia James has had some interest in InfoWars as well in the past.
[02:34:44.218 --> 02:34:45.180]  Let me just put it like that.
[02:34:46.737 --> 02:34:49.179]  I don't know if we've ever really talked about it or Alex talked about it.
[02:34:49.199 --> 02:34:51.960]  I mean, I guess it doesn't matter now, but in twilight, but I'll just leave it at that.
[02:34:52.421 --> 02:34:58.104]  Letitia James has showed a very high interest level in InfoWars in the past as well.
[02:34:58.144 --> 02:34:59.224]  I mean, this woman is crazed.
[02:34:59.705 --> 02:35:01.326]  This woman is absolutely crazed.
[02:35:01.946 --> 02:35:06.529]  She's stark raving when it comes to her hatred for conservatives and white people.
[02:35:07.189 --> 02:35:11.992]  And so you're just dealing with one of the most corrupt attorney generals really in the history of this country is Letitia James.
[02:35:13.413 --> 02:35:13.873]  Really something.
[02:35:16.752 --> 02:35:17.993]  Alright, we go back out of the phone lines.
[02:35:18.033 --> 02:35:22.174]  Let's go to Indivisible in Idaho.
[02:35:22.295 --> 02:35:23.815]  Indivisible in Idaho, go ahead.
[02:35:28.397 --> 02:35:28.978]  How are you doing?
[02:35:29.778 --> 02:35:30.138]  I'm good.
[02:35:32.259 --> 02:35:42.764]  Well, I got injured on 3-11-16 and you know how we have to hear Alex say that he goes by a voice in his head and that's what guides him to do everything?
[02:35:44.147 --> 02:35:45.588]  So, I got about the same thing.
[02:35:45.828 --> 02:35:53.113]  So, after my, uh, I had a dream that night, spoke to two blue eyes and it told me exactly what to do.
[02:35:53.133 --> 02:35:55.615]  I end up on the phone with an FBI agent.
[02:35:56.515 --> 02:35:58.657]  When I'm speaking to the agent, I tell them what to do.
[02:35:58.977 --> 02:36:01.358]  Word for word, exactly what's happening right now.
[02:36:02.379 --> 02:36:04.520]  And I did it because I know they're uninspired.
[02:36:05.021 --> 02:36:05.661]  They're easy.
[02:36:05.801 --> 02:36:07.682]  They're easily, uh, manipulated.
[02:36:09.223 --> 02:36:18.620]   And basically, everything that's happening right now, both to you and everybody else, And the legal department is what was told to me in a dream.
[02:36:20.681 --> 02:36:26.405]  And what's amazing is that it's happening exactly like that.
[02:36:28.086 --> 02:36:33.310]  Trump, he never would have been looked at the way he did had he not been like your average human being.
[02:36:33.950 --> 02:36:38.793]  If he was just another one of the rich, you know, rich people, he's untouchable.
[02:36:38.913 --> 02:36:41.535]  That's why most people become famous.
[02:36:42.075 --> 02:36:43.316]  They have that in the back of their head.
[02:36:43.973 --> 02:36:45.694]  They want to do it to be untouchable.
[02:36:46.594 --> 02:36:52.256]  But when somebody touches them, then they start crying, you know, on live TV and believe it's not happening to them.
[02:36:52.336 --> 02:36:53.316]  No, I can't believe it.
[02:36:54.036 --> 02:36:54.496]  Well, it is.
[02:36:54.516 --> 02:36:57.957]  Because you're just a human, no matter what your title is.
[02:36:58.398 --> 02:36:59.618]  Narcissism doesn't care.
[02:37:00.618 --> 02:37:00.878]  You know?
[02:37:00.898 --> 02:37:05.020]  So exactly like I thought.
[02:37:05.220 --> 02:37:06.320]  There's something amazing about that.
[02:37:06.360 --> 02:37:07.040]  Thank you for the call.
[02:37:07.160 --> 02:37:08.141]  What is that?
[02:37:08.361 --> 02:37:10.041]  What is a dream that comes true?
[02:37:10.081 --> 02:37:11.382]  Have you ever had a dream that's come true?
[02:37:11.522 --> 02:37:11.802]  I have.
[02:37:13.257 --> 02:37:21.683]  I've had multiple dreams that come true, or call them visions, and I mean, I'm not going to get too off into it, and most of the time it's kind of just trivial stuff.
[02:37:22.363 --> 02:37:33.610]  But like, I've had distinct dreams where something exactly, it's like what the last caller was saying, exactly how it happened in my dream, it then happened in real life.
[02:37:34.371 --> 02:37:37.353]  And I'm not talking about, again, I'm talking about like trivial stuff.
[02:37:39.189 --> 02:37:41.831]  There was one specifically when I was probably the first one ever.
[02:37:42.051 --> 02:37:43.573]  Maybe that's why I remembered it as a kid.
[02:37:44.153 --> 02:37:47.876]  It was like the first time ever where I had a dream and then the next day the exact thing came true.
[02:37:47.896 --> 02:37:50.098]  I mean, it's part of the mystery of life.
[02:37:51.119 --> 02:38:02.288]  It's part of the mystery of this consciousness, this creation, this divine creation and consciousness that we're in.
[02:38:02.508 --> 02:38:05.070]  I won't even talk about the dreams that I've had come true.
[02:38:05.751 --> 02:38:06.872]  It's mostly just trivial stuff.
[02:38:06.912 --> 02:38:09.535]   But yeah, I've had Hey Owen, great to talk to you son.
[02:38:09.555 --> 02:38:12.916]  Man, I'll tell you, I am so proud of you and I can't tell you how much I love everybody down there.
[02:38:13.016 --> 02:38:14.556]  Watching you grow has been amazing.
[02:38:14.576 --> 02:38:15.396]  Here's what I want to get to.
[02:38:15.215 --> 02:38:18.715]  this thing we call life and consciousness.
[02:38:18.715 --> 02:38:20.915]  All right, let's go to Gordon in Hawaii.
[02:38:20.915 --> 02:38:24.275]  Gordon, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:38:24.275 --> 02:38:27.255]  Hey, Owen, great to talk to you, son.
[02:38:27.255 --> 02:38:32.115]   Man, I'll tell you, I am so proud of you, and I can't tell you how much I love everybody down there.
[02:38:32.115 --> 02:38:35.655]  Watching you grow has been amazing.
[02:38:35.655 --> 02:38:37.615]  Here's what I want to get to.
[02:38:37.615 --> 02:38:43.135]   If you pound this into people's heads, this will be the one thing that'll stop people
[02:38:43.135 --> 02:38:48.395]   from voting for Democrats, and you remember James Carville saying it's the economy, stupid.
[02:38:48.395 --> 02:38:49.235]  Well, guess what?
[02:38:49.235 --> 02:38:52.715]   He's not saying that anymore because the economy has been ruined.
[02:38:52.715 --> 02:38:56.235]  Okay, here's the point you gotta get everybody to understand.
[02:38:56.235 --> 02:39:00.215]   When you have to spend twice as much for something in the store,
[02:39:00.215 --> 02:39:04.775]  that means you have lost 50% of your wealth.
[02:39:04.775 --> 02:39:08.475]   They've literally reached into your bank account and taken half.
[02:39:08.797 --> 02:39:17.863]  By the way, didn't Saudi Arabia just say they're breaking the long-term deal that they've had with America with the petrodollar?
[02:39:17.883 --> 02:39:20.365]  I think they just said they're breaking that deal.
[02:39:20.405 --> 02:39:20.705]  It's done.
[02:39:20.725 --> 02:39:21.586]  That'll be huge.
[02:39:21.405 --> 02:39:26.405]  out of the American economy and people just do not understand it.
[02:39:26.405 --> 02:39:33.545]   By the way, didn't Saudi Arabia just say they're breaking the long-term deal that they've had with America with the petrodollar?
[02:39:33.545 --> 02:39:35.265]  I think they just said they're breaking that deal.
[02:39:35.265 --> 02:39:36.265]  It's done.
[02:39:36.265 --> 02:39:37.265]  That'll be huge.
[02:39:37.265 --> 02:39:41.585]  It barely even makes the news.
[02:39:41.585 --> 02:39:43.885]  But that's just the way it goes.
[02:39:43.893 --> 02:39:53.717]  You know, the economy, this administration has been destroying everything that they possibly can, and now they want to raise taxes on every single thing.
[02:39:54.157 --> 02:40:05.161]  My property tax has doubled, every single thing that I buy has doubled, I live on less than $800 a month Social Security, and I live in Hawaii where things already half again as much.
[02:40:05.821 --> 02:40:10.523]  And I'll tell you, it's tough for people on fixed incomes, and that's how I notice it.
[02:40:11.181 --> 02:40:14.142]  I watched it in the 70s, 80s, 2000s.
[02:40:14.282 --> 02:40:16.463]  Most people vote on economy.
[02:40:16.643 --> 02:40:18.223]  Most people do vote on economy.
[02:40:18.263 --> 02:40:19.504]  It's usually the number one thing.
[02:40:20.224 --> 02:40:25.585]  And so we'll see how that plays out because they can sell Bidenomics as much as they want.
[02:40:26.066 --> 02:40:27.246]  Everybody knows it's bullcrap.
[02:40:27.326 --> 02:40:29.967]  Everybody sees their bottom line shrinking.
[02:40:30.047 --> 02:40:32.387]  Everybody sees their grocery bill, energy bill, gas bill.
[02:40:32.487 --> 02:40:37.249]  So they can lie all day long about Bidenomics, but people see what's really going on.
[02:40:37.629 --> 02:40:39.209]  Let's go to Andrew in Maryland.
[02:40:39.410 --> 02:40:40.290]  Andrew, you're on the air.
[02:40:40.310 --> 02:40:40.670]  Go ahead.
[02:40:42.475 --> 02:40:43.336]  Hi, Owen, man.
[02:40:43.416 --> 02:40:46.377]  I appreciate you guys all at InfoWars, man.
[02:40:46.557 --> 02:40:50.219]  I just, it's sad that you guys are going to be gone.
[02:40:50.259 --> 02:40:51.200]  Might not be there anymore.
[02:40:51.560 --> 02:40:54.742]  I just, I love you guys.
[02:40:54.842 --> 02:40:56.023]  I love all of you, man.
[02:40:56.043 --> 02:40:58.144]  I just want to say I support you guys.
[02:40:59.445 --> 02:41:01.386]  I've supported a lot at InfoWars, sure.
[02:41:01.406 --> 02:41:03.967]  I just want to say you guys are the greatest, man.
[02:41:05.608 --> 02:41:05.988]  Thank you.
[02:41:07.989 --> 02:41:19.622]   And also, I still think It's going to be a sad day when this happens, but we're going to rise and we're going to win this thing, man.
[02:41:20.403 --> 02:41:21.224]  That's all I've got to say, man.
[02:41:21.264 --> 02:41:23.106]  All right, Andrew.
[02:41:23.206 --> 02:41:23.907]  Appreciate that.
[02:41:24.027 --> 02:41:24.367]  Thank you.
[02:41:25.088 --> 02:41:28.791]  Let's go to Josh in Minnesota.
[02:41:28.811 --> 02:41:29.692]  Josh, you're on the air.
[02:41:29.732 --> 02:41:30.093]  Go ahead.
[02:41:32.045 --> 02:41:32.485]  Hey, Owen!
[02:41:32.705 --> 02:41:37.428]  I've been listening to you guys for several years, pretty much 8 to 5, Monday through Friday and weekends.
[02:41:37.528 --> 02:41:43.830]  I hope you can collect all once again on another platform for uninterrupted, extensive broadcasting.
[02:41:44.891 --> 02:41:45.731]  Big hole in my life.
[02:41:46.192 --> 02:41:47.352]  I don't look forward to that.
[02:41:47.532 --> 02:41:51.874]  I've been part of the conservative movement in Lac Qui Parle County, Minnesota for several years.
[02:41:52.474 --> 02:41:54.275]  I'm going to be running for City Council for Madison.
[02:41:56.246 --> 02:41:57.047]  That's going to be interesting.
[02:41:57.227 --> 02:41:58.868]  I've been raising awareness in the community.
[02:41:58.888 --> 02:42:01.670]  I'm talking with our newspaper editor at length.
[02:42:01.710 --> 02:42:02.251]  He's liberal.
[02:42:02.791 --> 02:42:06.995]  I'm making small, incremental progress informing him of the corruption in the media.
[02:42:07.015 --> 02:42:07.635]  He didn't believe me.
[02:42:07.675 --> 02:42:12.659]  But it started with a Tony and Bob Alinsky story because he had never heard of it and no one else had either.
[02:42:12.819 --> 02:42:13.900]  Oh, how about that?
[02:42:13.960 --> 02:42:15.381]  But I bet they know who George Floyd is.
[02:42:16.942 --> 02:42:17.643]  Of course they do.
[02:42:17.963 --> 02:42:18.223]  Yes.
[02:42:18.484 --> 02:42:20.025]  He's like a Trojan horse.
[02:42:20.843 --> 02:42:22.664]  I believe that we're in a spiritual war.
[02:42:23.024 --> 02:42:28.346]  A hive mind of darkness that's running through most of this nation.
[02:42:28.966 --> 02:42:47.352]  God is disciplining us, to say the least, for moving away from Him, and I just believe that as our movement continues, our movement continues toward Him, bringing His Word out into the light, and not backing down to the terrorism and the tyranny of the left.
[02:42:48.032 --> 02:42:50.679]   We just have to Lower our heads and plow forward.
[02:42:52.081 --> 02:42:54.586]  Something I talked with about the Second Amendment.
[02:42:55.086 --> 02:42:58.673]  Everyone's up in arms, figuratively, with the Second Amendment.
[02:42:59.972 --> 02:43:04.796]  People think that this nation is impervious to attack or invasion by an armed hostile force.
[02:43:04.896 --> 02:43:06.178]  They're kidding themselves.
[02:43:06.218 --> 02:43:07.198]  They're delirious.
[02:43:07.699 --> 02:43:09.601]  Well, the invasion is obviously already on.
[02:43:10.141 --> 02:43:13.864]  You know, probably 10 million people just in Biden's presidency alone.
[02:43:14.025 --> 02:43:14.945]  I mean, that's an invasion.
[02:43:15.206 --> 02:43:20.971]  Doesn't mean they're all coming here to commit acts of violence, but there's gangs coming in, terrorists coming in, all kinds of bad people coming in.
[02:43:21.011 --> 02:43:22.272]  So yeah, we've been invaded.
[02:43:24.109 --> 02:43:35.478]  They're collecting, and I believe that there will be those cells that are collecting and organizing in the shadows, and like Alex says, the UN isn't coming in with blue helmets.
[02:43:36.078 --> 02:43:38.720]  They're coming in, they'll be set up after that.
[02:43:40.117 --> 02:43:50.661]  I mean, we have Venezuelan gangs and prison gangs now operating in the United States doing smash and grabs, retail crime, home invasions, initiation rituals.
[02:43:51.381 --> 02:43:51.882]  It's crazy.
[02:43:51.922 --> 02:43:52.802]  Josh, thank you for the call.
[02:43:53.122 --> 02:43:54.703]  Let's go to Gloria in Nevada.
[02:43:54.763 --> 02:43:55.663]  Gloria, you're on the air.
[02:43:55.683 --> 02:43:56.063]  Go ahead.
[02:43:57.984 --> 02:43:58.904]  Hi, Owen.
[02:43:59.204 --> 02:44:00.825]  What a blessing to talk to you again.
[02:44:00.865 --> 02:44:02.926]  This is my third time calling in.
[02:44:04.116 --> 02:44:12.698]  My first time I called in, I called to thank you about talking about ivermectin and Senator Ron Johnson's COVID, a second opinion panel.
[02:44:13.338 --> 02:44:22.799]  The second time I've called you, it was to let you know that I'm standing up at the universities and I ended mandates for the whole state of Nevada for all universities.
[02:44:23.800 --> 02:44:30.721]  And today I'm calling you to tell you the good news that I was able to completely detox my system out from that COVID-19 shot.
[02:44:33.193 --> 02:44:54.690]  And you can go to diseaseinreverse.com forward slash Gloria and you can see the docu-series I made with Jonathan Otto, Dr. Edward Group, Dr. Rashid Boutar and I learned from them and I applied and able to detox and now many more are detoxing like Nancy Henderson, Josephine Walsh and Randy Knowles.
[02:44:55.476 --> 02:44:57.037]  And we're just so grateful.
[02:44:57.117 --> 02:44:58.718]  And so there is hope out there.
[02:44:59.038 --> 02:45:05.382]  And we all can detox our bodies of all chemicals, even the COVID-19 bioweapon.
[02:45:06.383 --> 02:45:07.964]  And I just wanted to share that with you.
[02:45:08.304 --> 02:45:11.967]  I'm on Rumble at Gloria Free For All with the number four.
[02:45:11.987 --> 02:45:15.909]  I'm on X at Sea Glorious Gloria.
[02:45:16.069 --> 02:45:18.731]  We have X spaces every Thursday night.
[02:45:18.751 --> 02:45:20.092]  Tonight we're having an X space.
[02:45:20.953 --> 02:45:23.074]  And every Sunday we do our podcast.
[02:45:24.397 --> 02:45:28.238]  Well, we've got the documentary playing on the screen right now, so I thank you for that.
[02:45:28.258 --> 02:45:31.179]  And by the way, on that note, this is in the news today.
[02:45:32.020 --> 02:45:38.642]  Dr. Francis Boyle releases affidavit confirming COVID vaccines are biological weapons of mass destruction.
[02:45:39.468 --> 02:45:44.492]  And he's doing that in an ongoing Florida lawsuit with Dr. Joseph Sansone, who's also been a guest on InfoWars.
[02:45:45.253 --> 02:45:49.036]  Both Dr. Francis Boyle and Dr. Joseph Sansone have both been a guest on InfoWars.
[02:45:49.096 --> 02:46:02.255]   And it was Dr. Francis Boyle that broke the COVID-19 Wuhan lab story on this show with me I was filling in for Alex that day.
[02:46:02.275 --> 02:46:03.716]  He just happened to be on, broke it with me.
[02:46:04.136 --> 02:46:06.056]  I believe that was either January or February 2020.
[02:46:07.516 --> 02:46:11.637]  And of course, he also broke the biological weapons story on InfoWars as well.
[02:46:12.457 --> 02:46:14.538]  And so, you know, that's the problem.
[02:46:14.718 --> 02:46:36.412]   And to go back to something a caller said earlier, just to kind of put it all in context, it has taken decades For this platform and InfoWars and everything it is today with the crew and everything and the different studios, it has taken decades to build this.
[02:46:37.072 --> 02:46:38.472]  So that's what they're ripping away.
[02:46:38.512 --> 02:46:43.733]  They're ripping away decades of work that it took to build this great platform.
[02:46:44.774 --> 02:46:55.636]  And yeah, I can go start up a livestream on X, but I don't have the crew, I don't have the studio, I don't have all the tools and everything that makes this show so great.
[02:46:57.102 --> 02:47:02.463]  And so, you know, to say, hey, let's get the InfoWars crew together and launch our new platform.
[02:47:02.783 --> 02:47:09.264]  Folks, they've taken 30 years of Alex Jones and this audience and everybody else that's contributed here.
[02:47:09.984 --> 02:47:15.425]  They're taking 30 years of hard work and blood, sweat and tears, and they're just deleting it.
[02:47:16.485 --> 02:47:21.986]  So, I mean, to say something can just pop up the next day, it just can't happen.
[02:47:23.587 --> 02:47:24.087]  But who knows?
[02:47:24.147 --> 02:47:25.067]  Maybe a miracle will happen.
[02:47:26.581 --> 02:47:37.069]  But this is the type of stuff guests like Dr. Francis Boyle coming on this show and telling millions of people the truth about COVID-19, millions of people the truth about the vaccines, this is what they're denying you.
[02:47:38.289 --> 02:47:39.951]  This is what they're taking away.
[02:47:39.971 --> 02:47:43.273]  Alright, let's take another call.
[02:47:43.373 --> 02:47:45.254]  Mike in California, you're on the air.
[02:47:45.294 --> 02:47:46.075]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:47:47.496 --> 02:47:49.818]  Hey Owen, man, this sucks.
[02:47:50.578 --> 02:48:00.636]   I've been listening to you guys for so long and just like the one caller said, man, it's like Monday through Friday and And every Sunday, and it's just going to leave a terrible hole in my life.
[02:48:02.097 --> 02:48:05.378]  Let me respond to that, too, because it's important.
[02:48:05.398 --> 02:48:14.181]  I think we emphasize this, and I've talked to Harrison Smith, too, but I will tell you right now, I will not leave a hole in your day.
[02:48:15.301 --> 02:48:17.862]  I will be live from 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:48:18.882 --> 02:48:26.444]   in whatever way, shape or form, X, rumble, whatever else, the minute that This is shut down.
[02:48:26.504 --> 02:48:32.128]  The minute the InfoWars War Room is no longer, I will be on air the next day, 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:48:32.749 --> 02:48:33.809]  I promise you that.
[02:48:34.530 --> 02:48:35.471]  I promise you that.
[02:48:35.611 --> 02:48:38.813]  I am not going to leave a hole in your 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:48:38.833 --> 02:48:39.114]  slot.
[02:48:39.234 --> 02:48:42.436]  I will be there, whether it's on X or Rumble or both or anywhere else.
[02:48:42.977 --> 02:48:45.859]  I know Alex is still going to be on X. I don't know what his plans are.
[02:48:45.919 --> 02:48:48.201]  I know Harrison is still going to be doing broadcast as well.
[02:48:48.261 --> 02:48:50.182]  He's told me he's figuring out what he's going to do.
[02:48:52.040 --> 02:48:54.441]  But I will just say, your 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:48:54.621 --> 02:48:55.821]  will be filled.
[02:48:56.021 --> 02:49:01.082]  I will fill that time space in your life if you tune in to InfoWars every day from that time.
[02:49:01.742 --> 02:49:05.103]  So let me just get that clear on my X account and my Rumble channel.
[02:49:05.543 --> 02:49:16.565]  But again, the issue here is this great crew, this great audience, this infrastructure we've built, three decades of work, blood, sweat, and tears, that's what they're deleting.
[02:49:16.605 --> 02:49:17.465]  But I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:49:21.710 --> 02:49:23.231]  I'm sorry, Mike, are you still there?
[02:49:24.091 --> 02:49:24.892]  I'm here, can you hear me?
[02:49:25.012 --> 02:49:25.472]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:49:26.133 --> 02:49:26.413]  Hello?
[02:49:26.873 --> 02:49:37.880]  Oh yeah, I just, you know, that's just coming from an everyday logger, you know, I'm a former cop, former, I'm still a Marine, you know, but I just, Rick, I just, I don't even know what to say.
[02:49:37.920 --> 02:49:49.447]  You guys are heroes to me, and keep up the fight, and if you guys ever need a good place to stay up here in Northern California for doing any of your investigations, we got one hell of a compound for you.
[02:49:50.512 --> 02:49:52.533]  You guys all take care and Godspeed.
[02:49:53.434 --> 02:49:53.974]  Right on, Mike.
[02:49:54.034 --> 02:49:54.775]  Appreciate that.
[02:49:55.535 --> 02:49:58.837]  Let's go to Concerned New Yorker in New York.
[02:49:59.137 --> 02:49:59.717]  You're on the air.
[02:49:59.737 --> 02:50:00.118]  Go ahead.
[02:50:01.459 --> 02:50:02.039]  Hey, Owen.
[02:50:02.579 --> 02:50:10.744]  I just wanted to say thank you to the crew and blessings to everyone, yourself and Alex and Harrison.
[02:50:11.364 --> 02:50:19.009]  And as far as this James goes, that Ivermectin was on the NIH website from the very beginning.
[02:50:19.494 --> 02:50:29.299]  Right underneath from Dezevere, along with all the other information that none of the healthcare professionals in my realm looked at.
[02:50:30.239 --> 02:50:33.181]  And so, that's a sore point for me.
[02:50:33.781 --> 02:50:37.443]  She's committing a lot of lawfare in this state, so we'll let that go.
[02:50:37.463 --> 02:50:39.644]  And out of state.
[02:50:39.744 --> 02:50:40.685]  And out of state.
[02:50:41.805 --> 02:50:42.846]  Yeah, she is doing that.
[02:50:43.526 --> 02:50:46.388]  But even more so, I'm still...
[02:50:47.795 --> 02:50:49.136]  Working on those elections.
[02:50:49.256 --> 02:50:52.519]  So Unite, number 4, Freedom.com across the country.
[02:50:52.579 --> 02:50:55.601]  There's quite a few states and they're always looking for volunteers.
[02:50:56.161 --> 02:50:57.742]  Are you talking about poll watching now?
[02:50:57.822 --> 02:50:58.323]  Wait, wait, wait.
[02:50:58.423 --> 02:50:59.283]  Are you talking about poll watching?
[02:51:00.924 --> 02:51:02.185]  No, let's lay it on the table.
[02:51:02.225 --> 02:51:04.387]  We're talking about Supreme Court cases.
[02:51:04.887 --> 02:51:06.188]  There's already one in Maryland.
[02:51:06.208 --> 02:51:08.109]  There's 11 more coming.
[02:51:08.790 --> 02:51:15.835]  And we're going to make sure that they are conducting elections via the law.
[02:51:16.454 --> 02:51:19.176]  Yes, we are number one, but you know what I mean.
[02:51:19.075 --> 02:51:25.515]  And so Unite4Freedom.com, as a matter of fact, the state of Texas is involved.
[02:51:25.515 --> 02:51:32.475]   The people there who are taking on their civic responsibility, because we are the fourth branch of government.
[02:51:32.475 --> 02:51:37.835]  Well, we the people are mentioned number one, actually.
[02:51:37.835 --> 02:51:42.875]   Yes, we are number one, but you know what I mean, people have forgotten their civic responsibility.
[02:51:42.875 --> 02:51:52.695]   Well, that's the problem with the free market republic is that it puts a lot of responsibility on the citizen.
[02:51:52.660 --> 02:51:56.343]  And unfortunately, a lot of our citizens have abdicated that responsibility now.
[02:51:57.724 --> 02:52:01.707]  It's not that hard to learn, quite honestly.
[02:52:01.887 --> 02:52:03.389]  If I can learn it, you can learn it.
[02:52:03.549 --> 02:52:04.469]  Anybody can learn it.
[02:52:05.690 --> 02:52:07.051]  But anyhow, thank you very much.
[02:52:07.072 --> 02:52:07.812]  Unite for Freedom.
[02:52:07.972 --> 02:52:08.753]  Unite for Freedom.
[02:52:10.220 --> 02:52:12.781]  UniteNumber4Freedom.com.
[02:52:13.201 --> 02:52:19.023]  I think there's 27 states, but not these states, the people of the states standing up.
[02:52:20.864 --> 02:52:23.145]  Alright, well we put that on the screen, people can check it out.
[02:52:23.165 --> 02:52:23.925]  Thank you for the call.
[02:52:23.945 --> 02:52:24.245]  There it is!
[02:52:24.605 --> 02:52:28.467]  Let's go to Stewie in Illinois.
[02:52:28.507 --> 02:52:29.587]  Stewie, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:52:31.928 --> 02:52:33.308]  Hey Owen, how you doing man?
[02:52:33.328 --> 02:52:37.730]  Dude, I've been listening for 14 years and I am going to miss the hell out of you guys.
[02:52:38.519 --> 02:52:39.700]  Um, I wish you all the best.
[02:52:40.521 --> 02:52:43.703]  Um, you know, I think I speak for everyone here.
[02:52:43.743 --> 02:52:49.008]  What I'm saying, everyone who's putting through this, put you guys through this, man, I hope they all choke on something, man.
[02:52:49.568 --> 02:52:50.489]  Screw these bastards.
[02:52:54.897 --> 02:52:56.378]  We have an authoritarian regime.
[02:52:57.019 --> 02:52:58.280]  We have an authoritarian regime.
[02:52:58.300 --> 02:53:01.282]  We have authoritarian leftists, Democrats, liberals, progressives.
[02:53:01.602 --> 02:53:02.883]  They are authoritarians.
[02:53:02.943 --> 02:53:03.784]  They are tyrants.
[02:53:04.284 --> 02:53:05.625]  And they're just proving it.
[02:53:05.645 --> 02:53:07.547]  They're showing the American people who and what they are.
[02:53:07.627 --> 02:53:08.868]  I hope the American people see it.
[02:53:08.888 --> 02:53:12.691]  100% bro.
[02:53:13.351 --> 02:53:18.315]  You guys, you Harris and Alex, man, you're the only reason I'm getting out of here.
[02:53:19.454 --> 02:53:20.254]  Man, I love you guys.
[02:53:20.314 --> 02:53:28.218]  I wish you guys all the best, and I'm glad I got to speak to you all, and thank you so much for everything you've taught me and everybody else, man.
[02:53:28.818 --> 02:53:32.619]  You guys, top tier gentlemen all the way.
[02:53:33.760 --> 02:53:35.080]  Glad you got in today, Stewie.
[02:53:35.120 --> 02:53:35.761]  Thank you for that.
[02:53:36.181 --> 02:53:37.982]  Let's go to Zach in California.
[02:53:38.042 --> 02:53:38.822]  Zach, you're on the air.
[02:53:38.862 --> 02:53:39.282]  Go ahead.
[02:53:41.563 --> 02:53:48.486]  Owen, I was fortunate enough and blessed enough to meet you in Las Vegas last year for Reawaken America Tour.
[02:53:49.093 --> 02:53:51.674]  And, uh, was able to pick up the tab at the Trump Tower.
[02:53:53.375 --> 02:53:58.077]  Was that the one with the, uh, you sent the smoky whiskeys over?
[02:53:58.097 --> 02:54:03.440]  I believe someone else sent the smoky whiskeys over.
[02:54:03.600 --> 02:54:07.402]  You're the gentleman, um, a farmer?
[02:54:09.483 --> 02:54:14.125]  Farmer, construction guy, owner behind Kinder's Barbecue.
[02:54:14.665 --> 02:54:15.105]  That's right.
[02:54:15.205 --> 02:54:16.526]  Okay, now I remember you.
[02:54:16.546 --> 02:54:16.746]  Yep.
[02:54:17.386 --> 02:54:18.327]  You had long hair, right?
[02:54:19.722 --> 02:54:26.126]  Long hair and let the Goldilocks just flow like America flows every day through my veins.
[02:54:26.986 --> 02:54:31.368]  The main reason I wanted to call you, man, is I'm truly blessed to meet you.
[02:54:31.388 --> 02:54:40.133]  I've been listening to Alex since 2001 when he first got on to 1530 AM radio with Coast to Coast, George Norrie.
[02:54:41.034 --> 02:54:53.857]   And it's something where you are a gentleman and a scholar, and I wish more individuals at your age just had the courage to stand up and speak out and uh i always wanted to just tell you a poem that i
[02:54:53.857 --> 02:55:03.217]   i wrote for alex that i wasn't able to meet him ever but i met you and i was gonna see if it'd be okay if i told you a poem all right go ahead make it quick i'm almost out of time i want to
[02:55:03.217 --> 02:55:18.252]   take another call at least all right they call me i look at you as johnny apple seed a modern day So, they call me Johnny Appleseed of modern day, planting seeds of knowledge to help guide the way, trying to feed the masses every day with a new cup of knowledge to help break away.
[02:55:18.732 --> 02:55:21.295]  Their minds are in chains, their emotions are in flames.
[02:55:21.775 --> 02:55:24.157]  If they can open their eyes, they can all be sane.
[02:55:24.638 --> 02:55:26.640]  Understand how easy it is to walk away.
[02:55:26.960 --> 02:55:31.004]  World Trade Center 7, WTC 7, waking the giant.
[02:55:31.553 --> 02:55:33.494]  God bless you, Owen, and everyone at InfoWars.
[02:55:33.574 --> 02:55:34.474]  Thank you guys for everything.
[02:55:34.614 --> 02:55:35.114]  Thank you, Zach.
[02:55:35.134 --> 02:55:35.975]  Good to talk to you again.
[02:55:36.055 --> 02:55:37.515]  Let's go to Lucy in California.
[02:55:37.575 --> 02:55:38.295]  Lucy, you're on the air.
[02:55:38.315 --> 02:55:38.715]  Go ahead.
[02:55:40.076 --> 02:55:40.736]  Hi, Owen.
[02:55:40.956 --> 02:55:43.957]  So, 50-50 on the warships being in Cuba.
[02:55:44.497 --> 02:55:49.199]  I'm going next month, but I'm worried that something might happen.
[02:55:50.339 --> 02:55:53.461]  And also, because of you, I didn't take the bioweapon.
[02:55:53.941 --> 02:55:56.362]  I educated my family not to take the bioweapon.
[02:55:56.622 --> 02:55:57.382]  I saved my mom.
[02:55:58.162 --> 02:55:59.103]  Sorry, I'm walking up the stairs.
[02:55:59.463 --> 02:56:00.143]  And my family.
[02:56:01.358 --> 02:56:05.639]  And thank you, and if I do get back with cigars, I'll actually send you some.
[02:56:05.739 --> 02:56:10.560]  All right, you broke up there, Lucy.
[02:56:10.600 --> 02:56:11.200]  God bless you.
[02:56:11.240 --> 02:56:13.841]  Thank you so much for calling, and thank you for sharing that good news.
[02:56:14.161 --> 02:56:15.702]  Let's go to Brandon in California.
[02:56:15.742 --> 02:56:16.542]  Brandon, you're on the air.
[02:56:16.562 --> 02:56:16.942]  Go ahead.
[02:56:16.962 --> 02:56:19.462]  How you doing, Owen?
[02:56:19.502 --> 02:56:23.923]  I just wanted to say thanks to InfoWars for saving so many lives from the COVID vaccine.
[02:56:24.164 --> 02:56:30.085]  I think it was you guys' greatest accomplishment, and we're holding down the fort here in California.
[02:56:31.636 --> 02:56:33.617]  Yeah, boy, I mean, that's a question.
[02:56:33.637 --> 02:56:35.278]  What's InfoWars' greatest accomplishment?
[02:56:35.918 --> 02:56:43.202]  I mean, certainly in the recent years, helping get Trump elected, stopping people from taking the bioweapon.
[02:56:43.222 --> 02:56:45.163]  I mean, wow.
[02:56:45.524 --> 02:56:46.864]  That's just the recent history.
[02:56:47.665 --> 02:56:48.005]  All right.
[02:56:48.265 --> 02:56:48.485]  Yep.
[02:56:48.785 --> 02:56:50.606]  I'm glad for the call, Brandon.
[02:56:50.846 --> 02:56:52.928]  I am out of time for today.
[02:56:52.988 --> 02:56:55.249]  Guys, who's our fourth hour host today?
[02:56:59.371 --> 02:56:59.651]  OK.
[02:57:00.792 --> 02:57:01.032]  All right.
[02:57:01.465 --> 02:57:02.086]  Well, you know what?
[02:57:02.206 --> 02:57:02.626]  That's fine.
[02:57:04.268 --> 02:57:05.229]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:57:06.310 --> 02:57:08.011]  Well, I don't know what to say now.
[02:57:09.012 --> 02:57:12.075]  Hopefully, we'll see you tomorrow on The War Room.
[02:57:12.175 --> 02:57:14.678]  Hopefully, you'll see Alex Jones live on air.
[02:57:15.439 --> 02:57:16.920]  Stay tuned, folks.
[02:57:16.980 --> 02:57:17.761]  Stay tuned.
[02:57:17.801 --> 02:57:19.563]  It's the legendary Alex Jones Show.
[02:57:19.922 --> 02:57:31.922]  www.infowars.com and .video. Your cardiovascular system is under attack.
[02:57:32.658 --> 02:57:33.379]  Everybody knows it.
[02:57:33.919 --> 02:57:40.522]  And I've got in my hands two products that are absolutely insane when it comes to what they do for your body and your overall health.
[02:57:41.122 --> 02:57:44.124]  One of them is the highest grade fish oil you can find.
[02:57:44.584 --> 02:57:46.125]  Everybody knows how good fish oil is.
[02:57:46.365 --> 02:57:47.385]  This is as good as it gets.
[02:57:47.785 --> 02:57:52.427]  And when you purchase it at InfoWarsStore.com, you support the broadcast, a 360 win.
[02:57:52.788 --> 02:57:54.148]  And then of course, Nitric Boost.
[02:57:54.228 --> 02:57:55.809]  You've heard all the rage about this.
[02:57:55.829 --> 02:57:57.710]  A whole bunch of concentrated natural compounds.
[02:57:57.829 --> 02:58:01.510]  that clean out your blood and clean out your cardiovascular system.
[02:58:01.510 --> 02:58:08.389]   Everybody should be taking both of these products at infowarestore.com. And both of them by the way
[02:58:08.389 --> 02:58:15.430]   are 40% off for a limited time. Now the sale is going to end in about two weeks because we've already sold out of more than half of these products since they
[02:58:15.430 --> 02:58:21.829]   came back in. But if you want to get Ultimate Fish Oil and Nitric Boost for 40% off, get them both today at
[02:58:21.829 --> 02:58:27.110]   infowarestore.com. I want to thank you all for supporting the broadcast. I want to thank you all for spreading the word because without
[02:58:27.110 --> 02:58:28.969]  Without you, we are nothing.
[02:58:28.732 --> 02:58:30.593]  And I'm sorry to people of bad news, folks.
[02:58:30.733 --> 02:58:31.494]  It's all over.
[02:58:32.074 --> 02:58:33.775]  We need to get ready now.
[02:58:34.155 --> 02:58:39.278]  People need to go to KEPM.com forward slash gold KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[02:58:39.618 --> 02:58:40.378]  You need to get ready.
[02:58:40.458 --> 02:58:41.379]  This is the place to go.
[02:58:41.399 --> 02:58:42.299]  I love them.
[02:58:42.319 --> 02:58:43.060]  They're great sponsors.
[02:58:43.080 --> 02:58:43.780]  They're great people.
[02:58:44.140 --> 02:58:44.580]  Or you can call 720-605-3900.
[02:58:47.962 --> 02:58:52.646]  In my opinion, you are insane if you don't get into silver right now and get some gold.
[02:58:53.326 --> 02:58:54.227]  And I wish I could do it.
[02:58:54.427 --> 02:58:55.468]  I'm under enemy attack.
[02:58:55.928 --> 02:58:56.468]  It's okay.
[02:58:56.528 --> 02:58:57.089]  It's fine.
[02:58:57.429 --> 02:59:07.937]  And I'm just looking at all of you wishing I was in the position you're in right now because I wish this wasn't the case, but I intellectually and spiritually know I'm 100% right.
[02:59:07.977 --> 02:59:09.098]  And I think you all know it too.
[02:59:09.498 --> 02:59:10.499]  We are screwed.
[02:59:11.405 --> 02:59:14.287]  But the good news is, humanity's waking up and we're going to turn this around.
[02:59:14.708 --> 02:59:16.289]  So, buckle up, folks!
[02:59:16.509 --> 02:59:19.231]  Buckle up and get ready now!
[02:59:19.691 --> 02:59:27.757]  Because the greatest crisis of all of our lives is happening now, and I'm just the watchman on the wall, the Paul Revere, telling you, the New World Order's coming.
[02:59:28.158 --> 02:59:28.498]  It's here.
[02:59:30.218 --> 02:59:37.218]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:59:37.218 --> 02:59:51.378]  InfoWars.com is tomorrow's news today.
[02:59:51.312 --> 02:59:54.357]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:59:57.705 --> 02:59:59.426]  It's Thursday, June 13th, 2024.
[02:59:59.466 --> 03:00:02.948]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from the InfoWars studios.
[03:00:03.488 --> 03:00:06.489]  We could be shut down as early as tomorrow, the 14th.
[03:00:06.549 --> 03:00:08.630]  I'm in court, federal court, in Houston.
[03:00:09.231 --> 03:00:18.955]  But today, Owen is hosting the show out of the other studio because I'm about, in just a few minutes, to be interviewing Terry Carlson for two hours and then Russell Brand today.
[03:00:19.015 --> 03:00:21.917]  Because we could be shut down any time, we're not going to wait on these interviews.
[03:00:21.937 --> 03:00:26.979]   We're going to post them both tonight At RealAlexJones on X and InfoWars.com.
[03:00:27.399 --> 03:00:33.601]  But InfoWars will be shut down literally within just a few days, if not hours, starting tomorrow.
[03:00:33.961 --> 03:00:39.182]  So be sure and follow me at RealAlexJones on X. But I'm about to interview Tucker in a wide-ranging, in-depth interview.
[03:00:39.242 --> 03:00:45.064]  His last interview with Joe Rogan, another fellow Austinite and good friend of mine, was explosive and incredible.
[03:00:45.544 --> 03:00:48.625]  I'm going to ask some of the same questions but elaborate on a lot of other questions that were not asked.
[03:00:48.945 --> 03:00:53.446]  I've got over 50 questions I've written right over there ready for Tucker.
[03:00:53.766 --> 03:00:59.969]  So I'm going to be sitting right here at this desk interviewing the number one media personality when it comes to Liberty in the world.
[03:01:00.789 --> 03:01:02.450]  The whole corporate media is collapsing and dying.
[03:01:02.470 --> 03:01:03.710]  This is historic what's happening.
[03:01:04.070 --> 03:01:08.252]  So be sure and join Owen today on this Thursday edition, 11 a.m.
[03:01:08.652 --> 03:01:09.313]  to 3 p.m.
[03:01:09.353 --> 03:01:09.713]  Central.
[03:01:09.753 --> 03:01:11.133]  He's hosting the show, doing a great job.
[03:01:11.974 --> 03:01:17.056]  And then tomorrow, we're going to air the full interviews with Tucker Carlson.
[03:01:17.976 --> 03:01:23.102]  And of course, Russell Brand, two amazing individuals for the pro-human Team Humanity movement.
[03:01:23.703 --> 03:01:26.566]  So we'll put out about 90% of the interviews today.
[03:01:26.606 --> 03:01:31.092]  We'll have some extra stuff that is only on the show tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[03:01:31.272 --> 03:01:32.553]  Central, 12 noon Eastern.
[03:01:32.814 --> 03:01:33.414]  So that's it.
[03:01:34.075 --> 03:01:34.916]  What a way to go out.
[03:01:35.845 --> 03:01:39.847]  I don't think the judge will shut us down right away tomorrow, but that's basically where this is going.
[03:01:39.867 --> 03:01:42.329]  He'll probably announce when we're going to be shut down tomorrow.
[03:01:42.349 --> 03:01:47.412]  And so I'll have more details for you by about 3 o'clock tomorrow, right when the show ends.
[03:01:47.612 --> 03:01:49.993]  That'll be a tape show with Tucker and Russell Brand.
[03:01:50.413 --> 03:01:54.836]  I should have the details for you, and we'll be calling in to the War Room that Owen hosts, 3 p.m.
[03:01:54.876 --> 03:01:55.096]  Central.
[03:01:55.116 --> 03:01:57.057]  So be sure to follow me at RealAlexJones.
[03:01:57.397 --> 03:01:58.498]  This is gonna be a huge interview.
[03:01:58.598 --> 03:01:59.379]  It's all free to air.
[03:01:59.459 --> 03:02:01.360]  Take clips, share it, do whatever you want.
[03:02:01.980 --> 03:02:05.763]  And at the same time, please support our sponsor, DrJonesNaturals.com.
[03:02:05.983 --> 03:02:07.024]  That's separate from InfoWars.

[03:02:14.790 --> 03:02:16.031]  I want to thank Tiger for coming on.
[03:02:16.051 --> 03:02:19.473]  I'm also going to be going on the road with him coming up in September and October.
[03:02:19.493 --> 03:02:22.275]  Huge events across the country that I'm very honored to be a part of.
[03:02:22.716 --> 03:02:24.317]  And so more dates and information are going to be announced.
[03:02:24.456 --> 03:02:32.616]   imminently, probably by tomorrow. So be sure to go to tuckercarlson.com and get your tickets down because these will sell out. It's like Trump rallies. It's going to be crazy. I'm just so
[03:02:32.616 --> 03:02:44.216]   honored to be part of the second American revolution 1776 worldwide. So God bless and good luck and we'll see you. While other networks lie to you about what's happening now,
[03:02:44.216 --> 03:02:47.016]  InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[03:02:52.216 --> 03:03:00.376]   All righty, ladies and gentlemen, InfoWarriors, make sure that you are tuning into that legendary interview that will be dropping tomorrow.
[03:03:00.544 --> 03:03:10.392]  Tucker Carlson x Alex Jones on what could potentially be the last time for the InfoWars platform.
[03:03:11.394 --> 03:03:15.037]  Which is pretty legendary, and as Alex said, what a way to go.
[03:03:15.238 --> 03:03:16.098]  What a way to go.
[03:03:16.138 --> 03:03:38.143]   But listen, what people need to understand that this is not the end, what people need to understand that this is not the full collapse, what people need to understand that the message and the mission, and the man Alex Jones, and the man Owen Troyer, and the man Harrison Smith, and everyone else in the crew, It's not over.
[03:03:38.163 --> 03:03:38.824]  It's not done.
[03:03:39.264 --> 03:03:44.106]  They are going to have to literally kill people in order to put an end to this message.
[03:03:44.126 --> 03:03:46.147]  And even then, I'm not calling for violence.
[03:03:47.307 --> 03:03:53.450]  I'm not calling for violence, but what I'm saying is that this message of freedom, it is ingrained.
[03:03:53.470 --> 03:03:57.432]  It is woven in our spiritual DNA.
[03:03:57.452 --> 03:03:58.532]  We're made in God's image.
[03:03:59.673 --> 03:04:01.414]  And that will never be put to rest.
[03:04:01.554 --> 03:04:03.809]   That will never Be silenced.
[03:04:04.630 --> 03:04:15.775]  And for anyone out there that may think that this is the end of InfoWars, as Owen Schroyer posted on X, I think it was last week, that InfoWars never dies.
[03:04:17.096 --> 03:04:17.936]  Legends never die.
[03:04:18.956 --> 03:04:19.777]  Legends never die.
[03:04:20.422 --> 03:04:21.182]  Like the Sandlot.
[03:04:21.543 --> 03:04:25.024]  Maybe we can run that clip when we come back in after this break.
[03:04:25.325 --> 03:04:31.568]  So I'm going to be breaking all this down and what I think might potentially happen in this next election in November.
[03:04:31.588 --> 03:04:33.269]  But this is not the end of InfoWars.
[03:04:33.629 --> 03:04:34.449]  This is just the beginning.
[03:04:34.810 --> 03:04:35.530]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:35.710 --> 03:04:36.290]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:04:36.330 --> 03:04:36.831]  Share the link.
[03:04:36.871 --> 03:04:37.371]  Share the links.
[03:04:40.538 --> 03:04:45.880]  Everybody knows, unless you've been hiding in a cave somewhere for 20 years, that fish oil does incredible things.
[03:04:46.381 --> 03:04:48.041]  But not all fish oil is created equal.
[03:04:48.562 --> 03:04:57.205]  Most fish oil has been pasteurized, it's been boiled, it's been heated up, and they smash the bones and guts of the fish, and it gets contaminants in it.
[03:04:57.806 --> 03:05:09.051]  We sell the highest grade fish oil there is, and it's pure fish oil, and it's not been pasteurized, and it is so good for your whole body, your cardiovascular system, your brain, energy, everything.

[03:05:55.655 --> 03:06:00.755]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:06:00.755 --> 03:06:14.475]  Alrighty, you are now watching the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:14.569 --> 03:06:16.150]  I'm your guest host Drew Hernandez.
[03:06:16.211 --> 03:06:18.172]  Shout out to the InfoWarriors worldwide.
[03:06:18.212 --> 03:06:22.576]  If you're watching on X at RealAlexJones, share the broadcast right now.
[03:06:22.657 --> 03:06:23.938]  Make sure to reshare this right now.
[03:06:23.958 --> 03:06:25.519]  You're watching on RumbleBand.Video.
[03:06:25.539 --> 03:06:27.741]  Wherever you may be sharing, share this right now.
[03:06:27.821 --> 03:06:42.270]   And one thing I want to emphasize to everyone within the InfoWar, and I've said this many times, it's always been an honor and a privilege To even be a guest on this show, whether it be actually via video or an audio transmission.
[03:06:43.131 --> 03:06:49.998]  I can literally only count on one hand how many people have contributed to my career where I am today, and I'm truly grateful for that.
[03:06:50.038 --> 03:06:51.199]  And I'm all about loyalty.
[03:06:51.679 --> 03:06:57.524]  And one thing I could tell you, without Alex Jones, without InfoWars, I definitely wouldn't be here on that front.
[03:06:57.565 --> 03:06:59.426]  That's just a professional front.
[03:07:01.334 --> 03:07:15.565]  Just as a young person growing up listening to InfoWars, I remember in elementary school after 9-11 and then obviously through middle school and high school, seeing the Truth or Movement just go viral everywhere.
[03:07:15.585 --> 03:07:28.656]  We Are Change, the collaborations with Luke and Alex Jones and just really tapping into information that wasn't mainstream as a young kid, you know, has a huge impact on you.
[03:07:29.958 --> 03:08:06.097]   And I always viewed Alex Jones as someone that was like just like wow like that's that's that's like next level somewhere you know what I mean that's like truly like next level super viral all over the world preaching his heart out outside of the mainstream being attacked on a daily basis and uh growing up watching that I mean countless video after video in the early days of the internet I'm talking ebombs world I'm I'm talking like, you know, early days of YouTube, pre-dates, YouTube.
[03:08:06.177 --> 03:08:09.499]  I'm talking like, you know, OG InfoWars.
[03:08:09.539 --> 03:08:12.561]  And there are people that have been watching Alex even before me.
[03:08:13.882 --> 03:08:28.912]  And so to watch this progression of Alex Jones and InfoWars, even as a young kid, has had a huge impact on me as a listener, as a viewer, as a friend having the opportunity to meet Alex, meet Owen Troyer.
[03:08:30.107 --> 03:08:37.249]  And the entire crew, every time I go down to the crew, and the studio to see the crew, it's always a warm welcome.
[03:08:37.309 --> 03:08:39.490]  It's like family, everybody knows what I'm talking about.
[03:08:40.450 --> 03:08:50.792]  If you've had the opportunity to even be around the InfoWars crew outside of the studio, whenever they're outside filming something, it's always a family reunion.
[03:08:50.812 --> 03:09:03.756]   And so one thing I want to emphasize is, and I've told Alex this many times, is Like if you base your niche, like your entire brand and model, right?
[03:09:04.997 --> 03:09:15.707]  If you could distill, at least for me as a Christian, what InfoWars really is and has been for decades, it is a complete opposition to the New World Order.
[03:09:16.548 --> 03:09:24.000]   And obviously there are nuances to that, there are foreign powers that have their tentacles all Globally, that's what globalism is.
[03:09:24.040 --> 03:09:26.242]  It's not bound to one race.
[03:09:26.662 --> 03:09:29.024]  It's not bound to one group of people.
[03:09:28.863 --> 03:09:42.064]  there are multiple...
[03:09:42.064 --> 03:09:45.443]  Our conversation is with Mr. Yuri Aleksandrovich Bezmenov.
[03:09:45.443 --> 03:09:47.003]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[03:09:46.997 --> 03:09:50.080]  He was the son of a high-ranking Soviet Army officer.
[03:09:50.620 --> 03:09:54.164]  He had an outstanding career with the press agency of the Soviet Union.
[03:09:54.204 --> 03:09:57.146]  It turns out that this is also a front for the KGB.
[03:09:58.147 --> 03:10:05.854]  He escaped to the West in 1970 after becoming totally disgusted with the Soviet system, and he did this at great risk to his life.
[03:10:06.515 --> 03:10:13.301]  He certainly is one of the world's outstanding experts on the subject of Soviet propaganda and disinformation and active measures.
[03:10:14.488 --> 03:10:18.690]  When the soviets use the phrase ideological subversion, what do they mean?
[03:10:19.430 --> 03:10:27.494]  Ideological subversion or active measures, in the language of the KGB, or psychological warfare.
[03:10:28.014 --> 03:10:40.960]  What it basically means is to change the perception of reality of every American to such an extent that no one... Alright guys, quick little technical difficulty obviously.
[03:10:44.890 --> 03:10:50.834]  I feel like I'm literally, you know, preaching to the Resistance while we're falling out of orbit.
[03:10:51.134 --> 03:10:51.714]  You know what I mean?
[03:10:51.734 --> 03:10:59.499]  It's like Owen Schroyer just said in the last hour that they're taking down the Millennial Falcon.
[03:11:00.399 --> 03:11:01.880]  They're taking down the Millennium Falcon.
[03:11:02.060 --> 03:11:09.535]   And one thing that I wanted to emphasize with that, like we're going down with the ship But at the same time, this is not the end.
[03:11:09.695 --> 03:11:11.736]  At the same time, this is not the end of InfoWars.
[03:11:12.076 --> 03:11:13.597]  This is not the end of Alex Jones.
[03:11:14.457 --> 03:11:34.264]   And that's what I wanted to emphasize before we lost you guys, is the impact that this has had on me as a young person, and also as a friend of Alex Jones and InfoWars, and professionally as my career, being able To be at the place where I'm at.
[03:11:34.865 --> 03:11:37.867]  There's only one way to go, and that way is forward.
[03:11:37.927 --> 03:11:41.790]  And when it comes to God's will, it doesn't matter what it looks like.
[03:11:41.830 --> 03:11:43.351]  It doesn't matter what it sounds like.
[03:11:44.392 --> 03:11:46.013]  We are called to hold the line.
[03:11:46.073 --> 03:11:49.155]  We are called to continue to resist.
[03:11:49.235 --> 03:11:51.397]  We are called to continue to endure.
[03:11:51.417 --> 03:11:55.700]  We are called to fight the good fight and move forward regardless.
[03:11:55.720 --> 03:11:58.021]  It's like the law of the universe.
[03:11:58.061 --> 03:12:01.464]  Everything is moving forward constantly and consistently.
[03:12:02.435 --> 03:12:05.439]  Everything is moving forward constantly and consistently.
[03:12:06.059 --> 03:12:12.507]  And that law will apply to InfoWars and all of the crew, all of the hosts, even myself.
[03:12:12.587 --> 03:12:15.951]  I find myself as an extension of InfoWars, a part of the InfoWars family.
[03:12:15.971 --> 03:12:18.353]  It's been a blessing to be a guest host.
[03:12:18.894 --> 03:12:20.235]  And I've talked to Owen about this.
[03:12:20.275 --> 03:12:22.438]  He was on my show, I don't know, last week.
[03:12:22.478 --> 03:12:25.180]   And by the way, Make sure to stay connected with me.

[03:12:44.949 --> 03:12:52.013]  Anyways, so to make that point, you know, when I had Owen on, I could hear his heart.
[03:12:53.163 --> 03:13:02.928]  And I received his transmission clearly when he was making the point that when InfoWars was de-platformed, was it 2017, 2018?
[03:13:04.069 --> 03:13:04.889]  Somewhere around there.
[03:13:04.989 --> 03:13:07.871]  And, you know, I had a small platform on Instagram.
[03:13:08.031 --> 03:13:10.492]  I didn't have the platform anywhere near that I had today.
[03:13:10.512 --> 03:13:13.954]  I hadn't met Alex Jones yet or pretty much anybody.
[03:13:13.974 --> 03:13:18.576]  I was just kind of doing my own thing on Instagram going viral and it was fun.
[03:13:20.217 --> 03:13:33.849]   But I, when I witnessed the takedown and the deplatforming of Alex Jones, it bothered me a lot that there was not a lot of people, uh, in, in, in the media at the time, right?
[03:13:34.289 --> 03:13:38.051]  Con Inc, Cuckservatives, all these so-called freedom fighters.
[03:13:38.211 --> 03:13:40.553]  No one wanted to touch Alex.
[03:13:40.713 --> 03:13:43.875]  No one wanted to stand by InfoWars.
[03:13:43.915 --> 03:13:45.196]  There were people here and there.
[03:13:46.536 --> 03:13:49.018]  And a lot of people have come out and admitted that at this point.
[03:13:50.442 --> 03:13:56.067]  They've come out and they admitted it and they admit, and I know people have personally apologized to Alex because of this.
[03:13:56.847 --> 03:14:00.690]  But the point is this, is I'm all about forgiveness, but we have to learn from our mistakes.
[03:14:00.750 --> 03:14:01.431]  We really do.
[03:14:02.371 --> 03:14:15.321]  And I bring up what Owen told me a couple of weeks ago on my show, is that for some reason, even though InfoWars was taken down off of all of the mainstream platforms, right?
[03:14:15.361 --> 03:14:16.302]  It was simultaneously.
[03:14:16.322 --> 03:14:17.063]  It was like a sweep.
[03:14:17.743 --> 03:14:19.925]  The last one to really hold out, I remember, was Twitter.
[03:14:21.813 --> 03:14:23.174]  Alex was still on Twitter.
[03:14:23.194 --> 03:14:24.195]  That was like the last one.
[03:14:24.256 --> 03:14:25.497]  That was the last one that held out.
[03:14:25.517 --> 03:14:27.158]  Then finally, boom, gone.
[03:14:29.020 --> 03:14:35.646]  But Owen was breaking down to me that, you know, for some reason people just believe that.
[03:14:35.666 --> 03:14:38.489]  I've heard Alex, if you're in InfoWars, you've heard Alex say this multiple times.
[03:14:38.509 --> 03:14:45.155]  When we got deplatformed, even though like a year or two went by, we still had a band on video.
[03:14:45.596 --> 03:14:46.597]  We're still on radio.
[03:14:47.446 --> 03:14:49.267]  We still have a massive platform.
[03:14:49.307 --> 03:14:50.328]  We're self-sufficient.
[03:14:50.348 --> 03:14:51.109]  We're independent.
[03:14:51.129 --> 03:14:52.029]  We have our own system.
[03:14:52.830 --> 03:14:59.675]  But people were still coming up to Alex and saying, man, it sucks that you guys, you know, lost everything and sucks that they took you off the air.
[03:14:59.695 --> 03:15:02.897]  And then Alex was like, what are you talking about?
[03:15:03.097 --> 03:15:03.978]  We're still on the air.
[03:15:03.998 --> 03:15:05.139]  We have our own platforms.
[03:15:05.339 --> 03:15:09.402]  Bandod Video, Bandod Video, InfoWars.com, Bandod Video, InfoWars.com, right?
[03:15:10.454 --> 03:15:13.955]  Even when Alex Jones is on with Joe Rogan, the 9-11 episode and beyond.
[03:15:14.055 --> 03:15:17.856]  All you hear is Alex saying, ban that video, ban that video, InfoWars.com, InfoWars.com.
[03:15:19.097 --> 03:15:19.877]  It's repetition.
[03:15:19.897 --> 03:15:20.857]  You got it.
[03:15:21.177 --> 03:15:24.098]  If you are not putting it out there, no one else is going to do it for you.
[03:15:24.518 --> 03:15:30.520]  And if there's anybody that I know knows that more than anybody else on planet Earth, it's that man right there on your screen, Alex Jones.
[03:15:31.541 --> 03:15:38.863]  If you are not going to do it, if you are not going to put it out there, if you are not going to speak up yourself, nobody will.
[03:15:39.703 --> 03:15:40.784]  Nobody will.
[03:15:40.964 --> 03:15:41.964]  Nobody's coming.
[03:15:42.404 --> 03:15:45.606]  Put your faith in God, but God gave you a mouth for a reason.
[03:15:45.966 --> 03:15:48.467]  And God gives you the downloads of truth for a reason.
[03:15:48.887 --> 03:15:53.930]  And God gives you the downloads of intel that you need to know to communicate with all of us as well, for a reason.
[03:15:53.970 --> 03:16:00.593]  And that is why the Luciferians want to silence, censor, de-platform, shadowban, and throttle, and take everybody out!
[03:16:00.613 --> 03:16:01.433]  It's for that reason!
[03:16:03.550 --> 03:16:23.721]  But, you know, and Owen has expressed this to me publicly as well, and I'm not saying anything that's talked about behind the scenes, that part of the big letdown was when this sweep and takedown of InfoWars took place 2017-2018, a lot of people failed to migrate.
[03:16:24.122 --> 03:16:25.082]  And this happens a lot.
[03:16:25.242 --> 03:16:26.503]  This happens a lot.
[03:16:26.523 --> 03:16:40.148]   A lot of people fail to migrate From these mainstream platforms which in my opinion are total government three-letter agency military psyops to centralize the internet.
[03:16:40.529 --> 03:16:43.930]  They lost control from the beginning but they need to centralize the internet.
[03:16:44.696 --> 03:16:45.737]  Launch it through Apple.
[03:16:46.277 --> 03:16:47.558]  Launch it through Microsoft.
[03:16:47.878 --> 03:16:48.559]  The big two.
[03:16:48.919 --> 03:16:54.123]  And those are the colossal store apps.
[03:16:54.143 --> 03:16:57.606]  And all you could really do nowadays is get an iPhone or get an Android.
[03:16:58.607 --> 03:17:01.889]  In terms of the masses, that's how they have centralized the internet.
[03:17:03.150 --> 03:17:09.550]   And that's why there's such a huge threat to Uh, anyone that builds their own app within these app stores.
[03:17:09.891 --> 03:17:14.854]  You know, Rumble could be taken out like that, literally like that, out of the app store, just zapped.
[03:17:15.635 --> 03:17:20.499]  I think that happened to an extent to PragerU a couple weeks ago, but they got it back up.
[03:17:20.559 --> 03:17:22.240]  You know, it's, it's, nobody's immune here.
[03:17:22.300 --> 03:17:23.081]  Nobody's immune here.
[03:17:23.101 --> 03:17:31.007]  The point is this, is for some reason people are failing to migrate and leave these mainstream platforms.
[03:17:31.067 --> 03:17:37.982]   Now, I, I also understand the benefit Of being on the platforms that pull people out of the matrix.
[03:17:39.483 --> 03:17:49.228]  But if we have both going on simultaneously, we really do have to make sure we emphasize building up independent platforms, building up independent systems.
[03:17:49.268 --> 03:17:55.492]  But the lesson now, and I want to encourage people, is this is not the end.
[03:17:57.133 --> 03:18:17.268]   This is why I'm watching Owen take the calls and I could see what's I'm not speaking for it, I'm just saying, I'll just say what I can see kind of bothers me, is I appreciate the love, we appreciate the support, but people are talking like this is the funeral of Alex Jones, and this is like the retirement of Owen Schroer, and it's not!
[03:18:18.348 --> 03:18:19.009]  And it's not!
[03:18:20.209 --> 03:18:23.011]  Alex Jones will still be preaching his heart out.
[03:18:24.632 --> 03:18:27.973]  As of right now, we know for sure he'll be on X. Okay?
[03:18:28.954 --> 03:18:30.655]  As of now, we know he'll be on X.
[03:18:31.625 --> 03:18:42.250]  Um, and as Owen already stated to you, he will be next day, you could catch him on X and on Rumble during his allotted war room time, and that is not going to stop.
[03:18:43.170 --> 03:18:50.013]  They could take down the ship, but if we gotta hit the, if we gotta get into the escape pods, you know what I mean?
[03:18:50.033 --> 03:18:55.516]  Like, if the mother ship is going down, we've done everything we can, okay?
[03:18:55.576 --> 03:18:57.757]  And I'm talking in terms of Alex Jones, right?
[03:18:58.057 --> 03:19:00.898]  And the crew and the lawyers that have stood by his side.
[03:19:02.273 --> 03:19:02.934]  And stood loyal.
[03:19:04.415 --> 03:19:15.844]  If everything's been done and the ship is going down, we go down with the ship, but if we gotta hit the escape pods, we hit the escape pods, disperse, and the transmissions will spread throughout the entire universe and throughout the entire galaxy.
[03:19:17.665 --> 03:19:21.708]  And it will be harder to hit individually than just one centralized command.
[03:19:22.349 --> 03:19:26.332]  And so I just want to encourage people of yes, it sucks.
[03:19:27.673 --> 03:19:28.754]  There is a legacy here.
[03:19:28.894 --> 03:19:29.414]  It sucks.
[03:19:29.694 --> 03:19:30.155]  There is...
[03:19:31.360 --> 03:19:32.001]  A heritage.
[03:19:33.141 --> 03:19:40.447]  Like, I'm gonna be honest with you guys, and for me, like, InfoWars is a part of my childhood, dude.
[03:19:41.247 --> 03:19:51.194]  And I know there's a lot of millennials out there that could say the same thing, like, growing up watching Alex, and then to now, it's like, this is a part of my childhood and my development, you know what I mean?
[03:19:51.795 --> 03:19:54.817]  So, yes, it sucks.
[03:19:54.877 --> 03:19:59.434]   There's something in your heart that That is getting shot.
[03:20:00.475 --> 03:20:02.136]  It's a piece of you, right?
[03:20:02.176 --> 03:20:03.597]  That's being ripped out of your heart.
[03:20:03.617 --> 03:20:05.038]  That's being ripped out of your chest.
[03:20:05.078 --> 03:20:07.140]  And if there's anyone that knows that, I can assure you it's Alex.
[03:20:08.021 --> 03:20:10.403]  This is, uh, this is his operation.
[03:20:10.463 --> 03:20:16.608]  This is, this is, because I just think of myself and, you know, doing my own thing in media, having my own show, building up my own business.
[03:20:16.668 --> 03:20:21.151]  And I'm just like, damn, you, you really put your, your blood, your sweat, your tears, and all of this.
[03:20:22.793 --> 03:20:34.315]   And all this does is it validates everything that the man It validates everything that the network, it validates that everything that the movement has ever preached.
[03:20:35.635 --> 03:20:36.515]  And it doesn't end here.
[03:20:37.015 --> 03:20:50.733]   And so I have to leave people with hope in God and we have to leave people, not a false hope, not an injection of hopium, No, you must continue to stay connected with Alex.
[03:20:51.474 --> 03:20:54.356]  If you are not following him on X right now, you must.
[03:20:54.796 --> 03:21:00.201]  You have to stay and remain continued in connection and connected with Owen Schroer.
[03:21:01.021 --> 03:21:03.503]  If you are not following him on X, you must.
[03:21:03.644 --> 03:21:06.826]  If you are not subscribed to him on Rumble, you must.
[03:21:07.927 --> 03:21:11.910]  Owen Schroer Live, you can find it on Rumble, at Harrison Smith, etc.
[03:21:12.030 --> 03:21:12.691]  Everybody else.
[03:21:12.751 --> 03:21:16.254]  Chase Geyser, Drew Hernandez, myself, and everybody else involved.
[03:21:17.947 --> 03:21:22.610]  Because I think we have to learn from the mistakes of the past, I'm telling you.
[03:21:23.251 --> 03:21:30.035]  And I saw it too, like when InfoWars was deplatformed, a lot of people were like, oh, I didn't know you guys were still on the air.
[03:21:30.115 --> 03:21:41.243]  And people weren't saying that to be disrespectful, but there's just, there's something about people being unwilling to migrate off of, and I think that's part of the psyop on humanity.
[03:21:41.303 --> 03:21:42.304]  I think that's by design.
[03:21:42.724 --> 03:21:45.386]  I don't, that's the only explanation I have.
[03:21:46.633 --> 03:21:48.716]  Like they think they're gonna find something else.
[03:21:50.579 --> 03:21:51.099]  You're not.
[03:21:52.982 --> 03:21:57.168]  Yeah, you might be able to find people on YouTube that are scratching the surface.
[03:21:57.849 --> 03:21:58.990]  They're milquetoast.
[03:22:00.174 --> 03:22:04.919]  They're not actually saying what needs to be said because they're all abiding by the TOS?
[03:22:04.999 --> 03:22:13.507]  Listen, listen, anyone on YouTube that has a massive following that claims to be America first, listen, I can promise you this is a fact.
[03:22:14.047 --> 03:22:25.992]   They are abiding by the TOS and they are capitulating To the demands of YouTube so they could remain monetized and remain having viewership and not get destroyed.
[03:22:26.332 --> 03:22:30.074]  But the second they do, they're gone and they're annihilated.
[03:22:30.674 --> 03:22:42.920]  Now the great debate is, well, is it actually a positive to have somewhat of a following and have somewhat of a message in order to somewhat red pill people?
[03:22:44.668 --> 03:22:50.291]  And have big guests that come on, like Nick Fuentes just went on the, uh... What's their name?
[03:22:50.311 --> 03:22:51.152]  The black guys.
[03:22:51.932 --> 03:22:53.213]  The Hodge Twins guys, right?
[03:22:54.174 --> 03:22:54.554]  Based!
[03:22:55.034 --> 03:22:56.215]  A lot of red pills going on in there.
[03:22:56.395 --> 03:23:03.099]  A lot of basic information that Nick has transmitted over the years, but the Hodge Twins audience needs to hear that, right?
[03:23:03.699 --> 03:23:05.200]  So I understand the argument.
[03:23:06.781 --> 03:23:08.122]  And did they even put that on YouTube?
[03:23:08.142 --> 03:23:09.983]  I don't even know.
[03:23:10.023 --> 03:23:14.069]   Did the Hodge Twins even put Nick Fuentes That interview on YouTube?
[03:23:14.089 --> 03:23:15.930]  I know they put it on X. I don't know.
[03:23:16.210 --> 03:23:18.850]  I don't really... I only really listen to Alex Jones.
[03:23:18.870 --> 03:23:20.170]  That's about it, to be honest with you guys.
[03:23:20.650 --> 03:23:34.693]  But just to use that as an example, I understand the argument of having voices within the resistance infiltrate big tech and speak out, but I think it goes beyond that.
[03:23:34.733 --> 03:23:43.175]   I think it goes way beyond, because at the same time, while we build out our own systems, We need to make sure that we are supporting those as well.
[03:23:44.195 --> 03:23:48.417]  And because, like, I've hated seeing this for the past few years where I've seen people deplatformed.
[03:23:48.938 --> 03:23:53.480]  I've seen people get annihilated and throttled and deboosted.
[03:23:53.500 --> 03:23:56.381]  This has happened to me to an extent on YouTube.
[03:23:56.462 --> 03:23:58.903]  This is why I don't really... I don't use YouTube anymore.
[03:23:58.923 --> 03:24:01.224]  I don't put my show on YouTube.
[03:24:01.364 --> 03:24:08.548]  The only platforms I stream on are Rumble and X. And however long that lasts, I'm not sure.
[03:24:09.885 --> 03:24:12.066]  They're obviously going to come for the URLs next.
[03:24:13.066 --> 03:24:18.609]  And this is why Congress, this is why our America First representatives need to take this damn thing serious.
[03:24:19.389 --> 03:24:23.751]  Because this will get to the point where you won't even be able to raise campaign funds anymore, or donations.
[03:24:24.051 --> 03:24:25.632]  You won't even be able to have a website.
[03:24:27.112 --> 03:24:28.513]  Remember, Trump has raised what?
[03:24:28.873 --> 03:24:31.334]  Over 500 million, half a billion dollars at this point?
[03:24:32.154 --> 03:24:32.575]  Through what?
[03:24:33.415 --> 03:24:34.035]  Through a website?
[03:24:34.896 --> 03:24:35.576]  Through a URL?
[03:24:35.976 --> 03:24:37.957]  I'm pretty sure some mail-in donations took place.
[03:24:39.386 --> 03:24:40.386]  But the website crashed.
[03:24:41.927 --> 03:24:42.827]  What happens when they come?
[03:24:42.867 --> 03:24:43.908]  And they've already talked about this.
[03:24:44.708 --> 03:24:51.631]  There have already been FCC conversations that have taken place where they're talking about throttling your internet.
[03:24:53.212 --> 03:24:58.674]  Seriously, they're talking about throttling your internet if they find you to be engaging and participating in hate speech.
[03:25:00.395 --> 03:25:05.757]  So if they start throttling your internet, you will not be able to even do a live stream anywhere.
[03:25:05.997 --> 03:25:08.418]  You won't even be able to post anything at this point.
[03:25:10.763 --> 03:25:14.927]  And technology will be totally hijacked, and those conversations are already taking place.
[03:25:14.967 --> 03:25:20.032]  And so my question is, what are our so-called America First?
[03:25:21.013 --> 03:25:25.337]  Because on a legislative front, that's where the fight needs to take place first.
[03:25:26.398 --> 03:25:45.638]   And, you know, I know Roger Stone over the years has claimed that he tried to warn Trump about Being deplatformed and censored and Trump didn't really listen and it took Trump to finally get literally banned off of Twitter to realize this is the real deal, man, okay?
[03:25:46.619 --> 03:25:47.239]  This is happening.
[03:25:48.540 --> 03:26:04.017]   And, you know, Owen Schreyer always talks about the New Right, which consists some of Gen X, Millennials, Gen Z, that are fully right-wing, Patriots, Crisis King, Uh, that, that, that, that, that want full results.
[03:26:04.737 --> 03:26:15.642]  And maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe that will usher in a change because legislatively we, we understand these things technologically and where these things go and what's being done to us.
[03:26:16.362 --> 03:26:21.344]  Cause these past generations are, you know, just handing us their iPhones and they figure it out.
[03:26:21.404 --> 03:26:23.385]  I can't figure this out and give it to the kids.
[03:26:23.425 --> 03:26:33.178]   Like, okay, well, there's, there's a reason why you're, uh, There's a reason why these older generations are being scammed out of billions and trillions of dollars because they don't want to take the time to learn technology.
[03:26:33.218 --> 03:26:34.638]  But hey, don't listen to us!
[03:26:38.020 --> 03:26:39.901]  Maybe it'll be too late, not sure.
[03:26:39.921 --> 03:26:44.603]  All I know is that InfoWars, as Owen has said, never dies.
[03:26:45.523 --> 03:26:48.645]  And this mission continues because the truth never dies.
[03:26:49.925 --> 03:26:58.633]   And no matter what these tyrants do, I mean, if we totally abandon the internet at some point in the future, I mean, that's where they're taking us.
[03:27:00.094 --> 03:27:00.254]  Right?
[03:27:00.595 --> 03:27:02.316]  They want to take us into the Stone Age.
[03:27:03.617 --> 03:27:06.239]  They want to go full green, full wind, full solar.
[03:27:07.840 --> 03:27:09.821]  They want to take away all fossil fuel.
[03:27:11.382 --> 03:27:15.125]  They want to take away all natural sources of energy.
[03:27:16.245 --> 03:27:18.267]  They want to plunge us into extreme poverty.
[03:27:19.398 --> 03:27:21.260]  Decimate the middle class.
[03:27:21.560 --> 03:27:23.502]  Collapse the middle class.
[03:27:24.443 --> 03:27:25.364]  Two-tier system.
[03:27:25.564 --> 03:27:25.924]  Elites.
[03:27:25.984 --> 03:27:26.385]  Peasants.
[03:27:28.046 --> 03:27:28.567]  Own nothing.
[03:27:28.607 --> 03:27:29.127]  Be happy.
[03:27:30.629 --> 03:27:31.530]  Totally controlled.
[03:27:31.550 --> 03:27:37.155]  I mean, in the direction they're leading, we need to put up a fight and a resistance.
[03:27:38.076 --> 03:27:44.382]  But at the same time, if this continues down this path, I mean, we're only going to have one option.
[03:27:46.946 --> 03:27:47.886]  The internet.
[03:27:48.246 --> 03:27:48.987]  What are they going to do?
[03:27:49.107 --> 03:27:50.528]  Ban everybody off the internet?
[03:27:51.929 --> 03:27:54.390]  Who the hell is going to be on the internet anymore at that point?
[03:27:55.231 --> 03:28:01.755]  It's like, if they just censor the entire internet, okay, well let's just take the fight in the real world.
[03:28:01.795 --> 03:28:03.296]  They want to take us into the Stone Age.
[03:28:03.336 --> 03:28:06.017]  They want to take us back 200, 400 years.
[03:28:06.558 --> 03:28:08.399]  Well, then, okay, we got to get old school.
[03:28:08.419 --> 03:28:09.759]  We're going to start preaching in the streets.
[03:28:09.940 --> 03:28:11.961]  I mean, as we are and as we should continue.
[03:28:13.368 --> 03:28:25.911]  And then they'll probably just start, you know, deploying kill squads and public executions and at that point it's going to get pretty gnarly and the rest of the world is going to watch and they will probably render the internet useless.
[03:28:26.551 --> 03:28:29.711]  But even at that point, freedom never dies.
[03:28:31.292 --> 03:28:31.652]  It won't.
[03:28:32.412 --> 03:28:33.592]  It never has and it never will.
[03:28:33.612 --> 03:28:34.792]  We'll be right back.

[03:28:38.820 --> 03:28:50.473]  As we continue to wait and hope that more and more people wake up every single day, some that took the bait are now starting to realize that we, the COVID unvaccinated, weren't all wrong.
[03:28:51.154 --> 03:28:54.498]  This is that message to you, the unvaccinated.
[03:28:58.231 --> 03:29:05.374]  Even if I were pollinated and fully vaccinated, I would admire the unvaccinated for withstanding the greatest pressure I've ever seen.
[03:29:06.114 --> 03:29:11.457]  From partners, parents, children, friends, colleagues, and even doctors.
[03:29:11.557 --> 03:29:15.578]  COVID vaccines are now available for children five years and older.
[03:29:15.658 --> 03:29:16.619]  Just get vaccinated.
[03:29:16.659 --> 03:29:17.579]  Get the vaccine.
[03:29:17.719 --> 03:29:19.060]  Just get the vaccine!
[03:29:19.120 --> 03:29:26.703]  People who are capable of such personality, courage, and critical ability are undoubtedly the best part of humanity.
[03:29:26.783 --> 03:29:34.829]  There are many thousands of physicians who have been silenced from telling the American people the good news about the situation, that we can manage the virus.
[03:29:34.949 --> 03:29:40.193]  They are everywhere, in all ages, levels of education, states, and ideas.
[03:29:40.953 --> 03:29:42.234]  They are of a special kind.
[03:29:42.294 --> 03:29:45.797]  They are the soldiers that every army of light wants to have in its ranks.
[03:29:46.197 --> 03:29:51.541]  They are the parent that every child wants to have, and the children that every parent dreams of having.
[03:29:51.861 --> 03:30:00.766]  A North Carolina teenager needs a new kidney in order to save her life, but her doctors say no COVID vaccine, no transplant.
[03:30:00.906 --> 03:30:02.647]  Vaccinated person having a heart attack?
[03:30:02.687 --> 03:30:03.547]  Yes, come right on in.
[03:30:03.567 --> 03:30:04.367]  We'll take care of you.
[03:30:04.588 --> 03:30:07.309]  Unvaccinated guy who gobbled horse goo?
[03:30:07.449 --> 03:30:08.490]  Rest in peace, Weezy.
[03:30:08.770 --> 03:30:11.511]  They are beings above the average of their societies.
[03:30:11.551 --> 03:30:15.113]  You need to evaluate the risk factor in the COVID vaccine.
[03:30:15.433 --> 03:30:21.095]  They are the essence of the people who have, well, built all cultures and conquered horizons.
[03:30:21.856 --> 03:30:23.376]  They are there, next to you.
[03:30:23.616 --> 03:30:26.397]  They look normal, but they are superheroes.
[03:30:26.978 --> 03:30:28.178]  They did what others could not.
[03:30:28.778 --> 03:30:34.221]  They were the tree that withstood the hurricane of insults, discrimination, and social exclusion.
[03:30:34.421 --> 03:30:39.743]  Now what really stands out about white anti-vaxxers in particular is that they act like their freedom has been taken!
[03:30:39.763 --> 03:30:41.203]  It has nothing to do with freedom!
[03:30:41.523 --> 03:30:42.664]  Screw your freedom!
[03:30:42.864 --> 03:30:46.866]  You don't have the freedom and the liberty to put other people in jeopardy.
[03:30:47.227 --> 03:30:49.388]  Banned from their family's tables at Christmas?
[03:30:49.888 --> 03:30:51.969]  They never saw anything so cruel.
[03:30:52.170 --> 03:30:55.352]  If someone in your family isn't vaccinated, should you ask them not to show up?
[03:30:55.972 --> 03:30:57.353]  Yes, I would do that.
[03:30:57.573 --> 03:30:59.634]  If you are not fully vaxxed, stay home.
[03:30:59.894 --> 03:31:05.718]  Everyone from police to teachers to firefighters must comply or they will face penalties.
[03:31:06.226 --> 03:31:09.709]  They lost their jobs, let their careers sink, had no more money.
[03:31:10.209 --> 03:31:16.354]  They suffered immeasurable discrimination, denunciation, betrayal, and humiliation, but they kept on going.
[03:31:16.914 --> 03:31:19.816]  Never before in humanity has there been such a casting.
[03:31:20.257 --> 03:31:23.960]  Now, we all know who are the best on the planet Earth.
[03:31:24.740 --> 03:31:34.427]  Men, women, young, old, rich, poor of all races or religions, the unvaccinated, the chosen of the invisible arc, the only ones who managed to resist when everything collapsed.
[03:31:35.228 --> 03:31:35.728]  That's you!
[03:31:36.569 --> 03:31:44.815]  You passed an unimaginable test that many of the toughest marines, commandos, green berets, astronauts, and even geniuses could not withstand.
[03:31:45.395 --> 03:31:48.237]  You are made of the stuff of the greatest who ever lived.
[03:31:48.617 --> 03:31:51.959]  Those heroes born among ordinary men who glow in the dark.
[03:31:52.420 --> 03:31:55.460]  Remember, you're the voice, and it's time to make it count.
[03:31:55.460 --> 03:32:15.059]  What did he just say?
[03:32:15.984 --> 03:32:22.245]  He said there's a storm coming in.
[03:32:22.605 --> 03:32:23.925]  I know.
[03:32:24.746 --> 03:32:28.246]  We told you what was going to happen, and it did.
[03:32:28.847 --> 03:32:31.167]  Now we're telling you what's coming.
[03:32:31.866 --> 03:32:35.066]  At Real Alex Jones on X.
[03:32:35.066 --> 03:32:46.906]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:32:46.906 --> 03:32:56.906]  [MUSIC]
[03:32:57.120 --> 03:33:04.505]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the Resistance.
[03:33:05.846 --> 03:33:14.950]   Rallying patriots worldwide, You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:18.612 --> 03:33:19.592]  You're the babe.
[03:33:19.632 --> 03:33:21.573]  The soul in the swat.
[03:33:21.593 --> 03:33:24.155]  The King of Crash.
[03:33:24.315 --> 03:33:26.856]  The King of Crash and a hundred other dopey names.
[03:33:27.476 --> 03:33:28.437]  Forget about that stuff, kid.
[03:33:28.837 --> 03:33:29.618]  We ain't got much time.
[03:33:29.638 --> 03:33:31.859]  I'm here because you're in some kind of a pickle, right?
[03:33:32.359 --> 03:33:32.559]  Yeah.
[03:33:33.500 --> 03:33:33.920]  Baseball.
[03:33:34.780 --> 03:33:37.982]  With my John Hancock on it went over a fence and you can't get it back, right?
[03:33:38.563 --> 03:33:39.323]  Yeah, right.
[03:33:42.090 --> 03:33:44.191]  Come here and get it.
[03:33:44.010 --> 03:33:45.010]  Wait, wait!
[03:33:45.010 --> 03:33:51.510]  I can't.
[03:33:51.935 --> 03:33:52.395]  Can't what?
[03:33:54.997 --> 03:33:56.077]  I can't go into that backyard.
[03:33:56.898 --> 03:33:57.258]  Why not?
[03:33:58.899 --> 03:33:59.859]  There's a beast back there.
[03:34:02.621 --> 03:34:03.181]  What kind?
[03:34:04.762 --> 03:34:08.084]  A giant gorilla dog thing that ate one kid already.
[03:34:08.363 --> 03:34:13.724]  Is that a fact? Sit down, kid. Sit down.
[03:34:13.724 --> 03:34:24.763]  Let me tell you something, kid.
[03:34:24.949 --> 03:34:27.230]  Everybody gets one chance to do something great.
[03:34:28.470 --> 03:34:33.851]  Most people never take the chance, either because they're too scared, or they don't recognize it when it spits on their shoes.
[03:34:35.071 --> 03:34:36.291]  This is your big chance.
[03:34:37.292 --> 03:34:38.292]  And you shouldn't let it go by.
[03:34:39.492 --> 03:34:42.993]  I mean, you remember when you busted the guts out of the ball the other day?
[03:34:43.913 --> 03:34:45.093]  Someone's telling you something, kid.
[03:34:46.133 --> 03:34:47.073]  And if I was you, I'd listen.
[03:34:49.054 --> 03:34:49.274]  Yeah.
[03:34:50.454 --> 03:34:50.914]  But what?
[03:34:52.688 --> 03:34:53.629]  You're the one with the rubber legs.
[03:34:54.449 --> 03:34:54.950]  Figure it out.
[03:34:58.832 --> 03:34:59.473]  Henry Aaron.
[03:34:59.513 --> 03:35:02.014]  I don't know why, but can I have this kid?
[03:35:02.915 --> 03:35:03.455]  Sure, yeah.
[03:35:03.775 --> 03:35:04.036]  Thanks.
[03:35:08.999 --> 03:35:09.219]  Wait.
[03:35:12.721 --> 03:35:16.444]  You're saying I should hop over that fence and pickle the beast?
[03:35:18.545 --> 03:35:19.326]  Think about that, kid.
[03:35:20.306 --> 03:35:21.306]  I'll see you later.
[03:35:21.306 --> 03:35:27.866]  Remember, kid.
[03:35:27.866 --> 03:35:30.386]  There's heroes and there's legends.
[03:35:30.386 --> 03:35:40.386]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[03:35:31.589 --> 03:35:34.632]  Heroes get remembered, but legends never die.
[03:35:34.652 --> 03:35:37.514]  Follow your heart, kid.
[03:35:37.554 --> 03:35:38.214]  You never go wrong.
[03:35:39.715 --> 03:35:41.036]  And InfoWars will never die.
[03:35:41.056 --> 03:35:45.640]  Heroes get remembered, but legends never die.
[03:35:46.601 --> 03:35:51.204]  And one thing I will tell you is that InfoWars is there.
[03:35:51.224 --> 03:35:53.646]  This is legendary mode now.
[03:35:54.246 --> 03:35:55.047]  This is what they've done.
[03:35:55.856 --> 03:36:02.619]  This is what happens when you make a martyr into a man, into a movement, into a message.
[03:36:03.580 --> 03:36:09.883]  It puts you into this legendary stratosphere that will never, never be forgotten.
[03:36:10.723 --> 03:36:15.106]  And this is why I agree with Owen Schreyer when he says InfoWars will never die.
[03:36:15.466 --> 03:36:23.870]  Because the spirit, the message, the momentum, the intensity, all of this continues on into the future.
[03:36:25.356 --> 03:36:28.279]  And listen, they could launch a million nukes.
[03:36:29.901 --> 03:36:31.242]  They could obliterate humanity.
[03:36:32.424 --> 03:36:41.413]  But at the end of the day, faith in Jesus Christ, faith in God, this eternal message, which is true freedom, where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
[03:36:42.634 --> 03:36:45.858]  That's what transcends us into eternity.
[03:36:46.610 --> 03:36:48.451]  And this is why Jesus made it very clear.
[03:36:48.472 --> 03:36:54.916]  Remember when he told his disciples, when he was preparing them for persecution, he told them bluntly to their face, don't fear man.
[03:36:55.317 --> 03:36:56.698]  Don't be afraid of these people out here.
[03:36:56.718 --> 03:36:58.039]  They're going to try to kill you.
[03:36:58.119 --> 03:36:59.720]  And in some cases they will kill you.
[03:37:00.140 --> 03:37:00.881]  He didn't sugarcoat it.
[03:37:00.901 --> 03:37:02.142]  He's like, these people are going to kill you.
[03:37:02.923 --> 03:37:06.545]  Because of meme, because of this message, because of the reality of being a Christian.
[03:37:07.346 --> 03:37:08.627]  Opposition towards Satan.
[03:37:09.808 --> 03:37:10.608]  They will kill you.
[03:37:10.829 --> 03:37:13.731]  Don't fear man that could only kill the body, but fear God.
[03:37:14.801 --> 03:37:16.042]  I could kill the body and the soul.
[03:37:16.082 --> 03:37:16.963]  He's saying, fear me.
[03:37:17.323 --> 03:37:19.164]  Fear of God is the beginning of all wisdom.
[03:37:22.127 --> 03:37:27.771]  Because the eternal aspect of our reality is what actually matters.
[03:37:27.831 --> 03:37:30.973]  Doesn't mean that things here temporarily don't matter.
[03:37:31.754 --> 03:37:33.295]  Because obviously we are struggling.
[03:37:33.415 --> 03:37:34.296]  We go through life.
[03:37:34.836 --> 03:37:35.717]  We go through trials.
[03:37:35.757 --> 03:37:36.818]  We go through tribulation.
[03:37:36.838 --> 03:37:42.122]  We go through a series of unfortunate events, which that's what life is.
[03:37:42.162 --> 03:37:43.483]  But life also is beautiful.
[03:37:45.034 --> 03:37:46.295]  But this life is temporary.
[03:37:46.975 --> 03:37:47.656]  It is a mist.
[03:37:48.637 --> 03:37:51.018]  It's a vapor, the Bible puts it.
[03:37:51.559 --> 03:37:52.560]  It's literally like a blank.
[03:37:53.680 --> 03:37:54.641]  Literally like a blank.
[03:37:55.942 --> 03:37:56.583]  That's our life.
[03:37:56.603 --> 03:37:57.503]  That's our existence.
[03:37:58.084 --> 03:38:05.449]  Because we are bound by this thing called time that God has created and put us to be bound by.
[03:38:05.469 --> 03:38:07.451]  Now God is not bound by time.
[03:38:07.471 --> 03:38:08.411]  He is outside of time.
[03:38:08.451 --> 03:38:09.552]  He is the author of time.
[03:38:09.812 --> 03:38:12.214]  He transcends time because God is eternal.
[03:38:12.274 --> 03:38:12.975]  God is!
[03:38:14.460 --> 03:38:25.887]  Now whatever level time is on in the universe as to its authority over the universe, God is above that because he's the creator of that.
[03:38:26.167 --> 03:38:27.568]  He's the Alpha, the Omega.
[03:38:27.588 --> 03:38:31.631]  And so this is getting into the aspects of the sovereignty of God.
[03:38:31.691 --> 03:38:42.287]   So with that fundamental understanding that our eternal destination and our eternal story It lies within Him.
[03:38:42.307 --> 03:38:44.488]  It lies within His Gospel.
[03:38:44.588 --> 03:38:45.868]  It lies within His message.
[03:38:45.928 --> 03:38:47.128]  It lies within His Son.
[03:38:47.148 --> 03:38:56.470]  For God so loved the world, He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever shall believe in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.
[03:38:56.530 --> 03:39:01.050]  This is an eternal, eternal topic that I'm on right here.
[03:39:02.991 --> 03:39:10.392]  And so with that reality, that helps us navigate our temporary life because we have an eternal perspective.
[03:39:11.337 --> 03:39:30.249]  Now, all of life on Earth and the universe can be absolutely annihilated, but this message and this gospel and this God... It's like when Paul was showing up in the book of Acts and he's speaking to the Greeks and he's saying, oh, to the unknown God, I saw you guys have a... I saw you guys have a... you have an idol out there.
[03:39:30.269 --> 03:39:32.311]  You have all these other gods.
[03:39:33.089 --> 03:39:36.271]  But there's one that really caught my attention to the unknown God.
[03:39:36.291 --> 03:39:44.616]  Let me, let me, let me, let me, let me define that for you because there's a big question mark here for your culture, for your society, for your civilization.
[03:39:44.636 --> 03:39:47.077]  And let me describe to you who this God is.
[03:39:47.958 --> 03:39:48.598]  God who loves you.
[03:39:48.638 --> 03:40:02.106]  It's a God of wrath, a God of justice, a God of judgment, a God of creation, of mercy and grace and serious everlasting eternal power.
[03:40:03.450 --> 03:40:05.091]  And he has this everlasting message.
[03:40:06.372 --> 03:40:09.853]  And this everlasting message, it carries us through absolutely everything.
[03:40:10.294 --> 03:40:16.617]  You see, to have this eternal perspective in reality, right now, is what carries you through times just like this.
[03:40:18.578 --> 03:40:45.112]   And you take a look at what's going on with InfoWars, and listen, if there's only... I know, for me personally, The only reason I have ever been invited on any platform, the only reason I have ever been elevated to any platform, the only reason I've ever been given an opportunity to be, you know, when Tucker's show is at the top of everything in 2020 to 2021 and beyond, right?
[03:40:45.132 --> 03:40:49.737]  The only reason I was ever on his show multiple times was to speak God's Word.
[03:40:50.996 --> 03:40:57.600]  And if there's one message that I know I'm here to communicate with the InfoWar and to the rest of the world on this platform, it's that.
[03:40:58.661 --> 03:40:59.302]  It's his word.
[03:40:59.342 --> 03:41:02.664]  It's his eternal word that carries us on into the future.
[03:41:02.724 --> 03:41:07.547]  And you know, I know there will be people out there that still are feeling it right now.
[03:41:07.607 --> 03:41:08.888]  You feel that rebellion.
[03:41:10.209 --> 03:41:11.370]  Drew, I don't want to hear that right now.
[03:41:11.390 --> 03:41:12.490]  Well, maybe you need to.
[03:41:13.791 --> 03:41:15.112]  Maybe you've tried everything.
[03:41:15.632 --> 03:41:16.333]  Is it working?
[03:41:17.222 --> 03:41:24.888]  And I'm not talking about solving all of your problems and making the pain go away and making the trials go away and making the tribulations go away.
[03:41:25.208 --> 03:41:31.813]  Obviously, God can do that and give you some relief because He knows what we need and He knows how much we can take.
[03:41:33.454 --> 03:41:42.141]  But one thing I will tell you is that God will literally hit you in the face with truth and allow you to hit rock bottom in order to get your attention.
[03:41:46.360 --> 03:41:49.682]  Brace for impact, America, because I don't know where we're really going.
[03:41:50.842 --> 03:41:51.583]  I'm not a prophet.
[03:41:51.683 --> 03:41:52.543]  I can't tell the future.
[03:41:52.563 --> 03:41:54.684]  I know God's Word.
[03:41:55.825 --> 03:42:14.734]  And I know the way that America is functioning right now, with the embrace and celebration of infanticide, that human sacrifice of babies and murder, and the embrace and celebration of sodomy and homosexuality that spits in the face of God's creation, traditional marriage.
[03:42:16.957 --> 03:42:19.319]  And full-blown idolatry everywhere you look?
[03:42:20.440 --> 03:42:25.004]  All I know is that God will not be mocked.
[03:42:27.166 --> 03:42:28.727]  And I've been saying this on my own show.
[03:42:29.388 --> 03:42:30.408]  Make your peace with God.
[03:42:30.869 --> 03:42:31.249]  Repent.
[03:42:31.309 --> 03:42:32.670]  The Kingdom of God is at hand.
[03:42:33.471 --> 03:42:45.261]  You confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and confess that God had raised them from the dead, and believe in your heart that God had raised them from the dead, you shall be saved.
[03:42:47.381 --> 03:42:49.063]  I don't know what else to tell people at this point.
[03:42:52.305 --> 03:42:58.671]  You've got Russia staging their armory on the coast of the United States of America.
[03:42:58.731 --> 03:43:00.933]  People could debate if that's just for show.
[03:43:01.033 --> 03:43:02.995]  Are they actually going to annihilate this country?
[03:43:03.235 --> 03:43:05.797]  If you ask me, I think America deserves to be annihilated.
[03:43:08.480 --> 03:43:09.881]  You think this country is right with God?
[03:43:11.042 --> 03:43:12.283]  We've removed God out of everything.
[03:43:13.935 --> 03:43:22.497]  School, the media, the culture, the arts, the science community, the health community.
[03:43:22.997 --> 03:43:25.517]  Why do you think everything's being taken over by the Luciferians?
[03:43:27.198 --> 03:43:30.538]  And the Dr. Fauci's and the Bill Gates, all these Satanists of the world.
[03:43:31.959 --> 03:43:43.281]  Well, if people want to keep thinking that the solution to fixing this is trying everything but submitting to God and applying his word, let's just start legislatively as Americans.
[03:43:43.985 --> 03:43:45.326]  No, Drew, that's tyrannical!
[03:43:45.506 --> 03:43:52.169]  Oh, okay, yeah, keep telling yourself that while these homosexuals and communists and globalists and luciferians continue to dominate and destroy you.
[03:43:52.189 --> 03:43:55.531]  Just go read the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.
[03:43:55.551 --> 03:43:56.451]  Just go by yourself.
[03:43:56.831 --> 03:43:59.593]  If you've never read the Bible before, go read Romans 1.
[03:43:59.893 --> 03:44:01.554]  Go read the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.
[03:44:01.594 --> 03:44:04.055]  Come back and please tell me that that is not happening today.
[03:44:06.761 --> 03:44:33.299]   But if people want to still sit here and think that this thing could be solved without God's intervention, without God's Word, without obedience to God and a return to Christ, guys, the Old Testament story after story after story, that is literally the story of the Old Testament when it comes to God's relationship with Israel, which is this constant Back and forth.
[03:44:33.719 --> 03:44:34.799]  Read the Book of Judges.
[03:44:34.979 --> 03:44:42.343]  Read how God deals with nations that run around claiming to be His people.
[03:44:45.665 --> 03:44:46.265]  That's biblical.
[03:44:49.244 --> 03:44:57.548]  It's a constant back and forth, a return, being sent into exile, the nation or the land being obliterated and invaded.
[03:44:57.628 --> 03:45:01.531]  It's this back and forth over and over and over and over and over and over.
[03:45:01.891 --> 03:45:03.512]  And listen, I'm talking about America.
[03:45:03.552 --> 03:45:09.455]  If you think for one second that the United States of America is immune from God's judgment, you are retarded.
[03:45:09.475 --> 03:45:11.216]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[03:45:11.596 --> 03:45:12.196]  You're blind.
[03:45:14.217 --> 03:45:16.979]  And your mind has probably been hijacked by Satan.
[03:45:17.019 --> 03:45:17.379]  Focus.
[03:45:18.908 --> 03:45:19.588]  Look around you.
[03:45:19.628 --> 03:45:20.728]  Everything's being taken over.
[03:45:22.629 --> 03:45:25.389]  The United States of America has been infiltrated.
[03:45:26.470 --> 03:45:27.690]  The enemies are within the gates.
[03:45:28.270 --> 03:45:29.510]  You got this Israeli lobby.
[03:45:29.530 --> 03:45:30.790]  You got the Ukraine lobby.
[03:45:31.131 --> 03:45:34.631]  You got the CCP buying up all the land, infiltrating through Southern California.
[03:45:34.651 --> 03:45:37.812]  You got Iran raping us of our tax money.
[03:45:38.352 --> 03:45:43.193]  You have a full-blown, full-scale infiltration of the West.
[03:45:43.973 --> 03:45:45.614]  The collapse is already in.
[03:45:46.594 --> 03:45:57.433]   And one thing that I've But I've been, I'll just say, thinking to myself, and I've mentioned this on my show a couple times, is what happens if Trump does win?
[03:45:58.753 --> 03:45:59.353]  Where do we go?
[03:46:01.773 --> 03:46:05.954]  And I'm talking between Election Day and Inauguration Day.
[03:46:06.935 --> 03:46:12.896]  You got that, you got that short, what, couple months window between November and January.
[03:46:13.876 --> 03:46:17.057]  Let's say the two-big-de-rig theory ends up being correct.
[03:46:18.457 --> 03:46:19.237]  Let's just go with that.
[03:46:19.841 --> 03:46:22.642]  Because they could rig this election in so many ways.
[03:46:24.163 --> 03:46:27.485]  They're letting millions of illegals vote in this election.
[03:46:27.505 --> 03:46:28.365]  You understand that, right?
[03:46:29.246 --> 03:46:30.166]  It's already happening.
[03:46:30.487 --> 03:46:31.387]  That's why they're here.
[03:46:32.808 --> 03:46:34.329]  Whether they rig it through the illegals.
[03:46:34.689 --> 03:46:36.150]  Whether they rig it through the machines.
[03:46:36.550 --> 03:46:38.051]  Or whether they stuff the ballots.
[03:46:38.791 --> 03:46:42.093]  Whether they resurrect the dead by the millions.
[03:46:43.013 --> 03:46:45.434]  Or maybe you moved out of California to Texas.
[03:46:45.915 --> 03:46:48.096]  Or maybe you moved out of California to Florida.
[03:46:48.911 --> 03:46:55.556]  Maybe you're still going to be voting in the 2024 election for Joe Biden and all the other Democrats in the state of California.
[03:46:58.679 --> 03:47:01.621]  Will the too-big-to-rig theory be correct?
[03:47:02.381 --> 03:47:03.402]  Let's just say it is.
[03:47:05.864 --> 03:47:08.146]  Will Kamala Harris certify the 2024 election?
[03:47:07.965 --> 03:47:19.348]   Oh, Drew, post-2020, Democrats came out and made it very clear that the vice president It's the law of the land.
[03:47:19.408 --> 03:47:20.188]  They must do it.
[03:47:20.228 --> 03:47:22.811]  Yeah, since when did Democrats abide by the law?
[03:47:23.812 --> 03:47:34.361]  And since when do Democrats not just switch the law literally within the hour to go along with their narrative and their operations and their agendas?
[03:47:35.082 --> 03:47:35.723]  What happens?
[03:47:35.823 --> 03:47:37.024]  Will Kamala Harris?
[03:47:37.524 --> 03:47:39.126]  Let's say that it's actually Joe.
[03:47:39.870 --> 03:47:48.797]  Let's say Joe is the declared nominee DNC convention and Kamala Harris the VP.
[03:47:49.357 --> 03:47:50.678]  Let's say they actually go with that.
[03:47:51.819 --> 03:47:52.560]  We have an election.
[03:47:54.081 --> 03:47:56.863]  Too big to rig theory is correct.
[03:47:57.743 --> 03:47:58.304]  Trump wins.
[03:48:01.166 --> 03:48:06.330]  I predict that they will, they've already painted Vladimir Putin to be the boogeyman the past eight years.
[03:48:08.187 --> 03:48:09.869]  And they've pushed him over the edge.
[03:48:09.909 --> 03:48:13.792]  They got NATO wanting World War III and they're pinning it.
[03:48:14.013 --> 03:48:25.924]  They're literally painting Trump and for the past eight years, if you've paid attention, they've painted Trump and Vladimir Putin, both simultaneously as an Adolf Hitler 2.0 threat.
[03:48:27.385 --> 03:48:28.446]  You've seen them all do this.
[03:48:29.307 --> 03:48:31.829]  The Uniparty does this in America with Vladimir Putin.
[03:48:32.610 --> 03:48:43.717]   They literally paint him As he is a Russian warlord that wants to conquer all of Europe to build some type of Russian supremacy.
[03:48:45.198 --> 03:48:45.458]  Right?
[03:48:46.638 --> 03:48:52.881]  And then now you got Russians on our coasts, which has been happening for years, by the way.
[03:48:56.303 --> 03:48:57.963]  I think, and I predict, I could be wrong.
[03:48:59.744 --> 03:49:03.286]  If the too big to rig theory is correct, I predict Trump wins.
[03:49:05.425 --> 03:49:10.467]  They will bring back the Russia collusion narrative.
[03:49:10.567 --> 03:49:16.189]  They will say that the Russians colluded with Trump or Trump colluded with the Russians to win and these are illegitimate results.
[03:49:16.389 --> 03:49:19.991]  Now, I know that sounds crazy, but that's why I think that's why they'll go with it.
[03:49:21.271 --> 03:49:29.274]  Because if you've noticed, if you haven't noticed, literally just the past six months, they have been flip-flopping back and forth.
[03:49:29.334 --> 03:49:34.158]   It's like the Matrix is just like, They don't care anymore if people see that they're hypocritical.
[03:49:34.198 --> 03:49:38.981]  They are not concerned as to whether people see their hypocrisy and their double standards.
[03:49:39.001 --> 03:49:39.842]  They don't give a damn.
[03:49:41.683 --> 03:49:44.946]  Just this past month, they got Joe Biden executive action.
[03:49:44.966 --> 03:49:47.347]  We're shutting down the border and Republicans didn't want to do it.
[03:49:47.667 --> 03:49:50.049]  Trump told Republicans he didn't want to secure the border.
[03:49:50.309 --> 03:49:51.270]  He's lying to you.
[03:49:51.490 --> 03:49:53.392]  Joe Biden's the one that's securing the border.
[03:49:53.592 --> 03:49:56.694]  And unfortunately, there are millions of retards out there that believe it.
[03:49:59.668 --> 03:50:01.969]  My point is, is they flip-flop like it's nothing.
[03:50:02.169 --> 03:50:06.610]  They interchange these narratives and these PSYOPs like they're clothes.
[03:50:06.630 --> 03:50:12.672]  It's literally like an NPC brain chip that's dropped in, taken out, dropped in, taken out, dropped in, taken out.
[03:50:15.752 --> 03:50:21.234]  You don't think that they could resurrect the Trump colluded with Russia to win the election narrative again?
[03:50:21.254 --> 03:50:23.615]  In November, if he wins?
[03:50:23.775 --> 03:50:24.495]  I think they will.
[03:50:27.367 --> 03:50:29.709]  And we are going to see all hell break loose.
[03:50:30.089 --> 03:50:33.012]  They will say that Trump colluded with Russia to rig the election.
[03:50:35.074 --> 03:50:36.515]  They will launch mass riots.
[03:50:37.356 --> 03:50:40.118]  You're going to see BLM, Antifa, everyone.
[03:50:40.258 --> 03:50:41.259]  Everyone activated.
[03:50:41.659 --> 03:50:45.362]  Just like what's happening in Paris!
[03:50:46.323 --> 03:50:50.587]  Look at the rise of populism and the right wing and the freedom movement in Europe.
[03:50:50.867 --> 03:50:51.908]  Total backlash.
[03:50:53.009 --> 03:50:57.812]   Macron has to call emergency elections to try to Literally sweep it under the rug.
[03:50:59.313 --> 03:51:01.053]  And then immediately the left wing does what?
[03:51:01.513 --> 03:51:02.633]  They're rioting in Paris.
[03:51:02.653 --> 03:51:04.854]  They're literally rioting head-to-head with the police.
[03:51:04.914 --> 03:51:06.314]  Mass instability.
[03:51:06.354 --> 03:51:07.794]  I think they will launch riots.
[03:51:09.075 --> 03:51:11.475]  And they will say these riots are justified.
[03:51:11.495 --> 03:51:15.816]  And they're taking place because this is an attack on our democracy.
[03:51:16.116 --> 03:51:20.337]  And then the MAGA Republican terrorist extremist narrative locks in.
[03:51:21.903 --> 03:51:24.865]  We told you people, these people are a threat to our democracy.
[03:51:25.165 --> 03:51:29.027]  They've been trying, they've already tried a coup to overthrow our government.
[03:51:29.767 --> 03:51:45.736]  Here's the evidence, doesn't matter, literally, literally what all these people have to do is get a damn piece of paper and have Kamala Harris with crayon write, here is our evidence, Russia collusion, believe us, and there will be millions of retards out there that believe it.
[03:51:45.996 --> 03:51:51.319]  Not you and I, the InfoWarriors, but still the retards in the matrix that will literally believe it.
[03:51:52.014 --> 03:52:16.382]   They will launch race riots, and they will launch mass riots, excuse me, at the same time, as a justification, as a response, all Soros paid and activated simultaneously, as a response to justify, this is an attack on our democracy, the MAGA Republican extremists tried to collude with Russia, To rig this election.
[03:52:16.563 --> 03:52:17.524]  They were successful.
[03:52:17.824 --> 03:52:19.507]  These results are not accurate.
[03:52:19.627 --> 03:52:22.491]  There's no way Trump can beat Joe Biden or Kamala Harris.
[03:52:23.071 --> 03:52:23.592]  We won.
[03:52:23.933 --> 03:52:25.675]  Here's our evidence written in crayon.
[03:52:25.695 --> 03:52:26.676]  Doesn't matter what it is.
[03:52:27.538 --> 03:52:29.160]  Here's our evidence written in crayon.
[03:52:30.126 --> 03:52:35.771]  So all of these riots taking place, this is a justified act of democracy.
[03:52:35.791 --> 03:52:36.631]  It will be violent.
[03:52:36.831 --> 03:52:38.293]  They'll be burning down buildings.
[03:52:38.913 --> 03:52:41.095]  And they will say, keep doing it, keep doing it.
[03:52:41.555 --> 03:52:50.002]  The only way you will see relief is if you listen to us, reject the election results, reject Trump, because that's a threat.
[03:52:50.482 --> 03:52:59.204]  To our democracy and the only way it's going to go away is if you keep the peace and you capitulate and you go with the official narrative.
[03:52:59.524 --> 03:53:00.404]  We're the experts.
[03:53:00.724 --> 03:53:01.704]  We're the ones who won.
[03:53:02.144 --> 03:53:03.405]  Trump colluded with Russia.
[03:53:03.685 --> 03:53:05.385]  These election results are not true.
[03:53:05.645 --> 03:53:07.505]  This is a coup against our government.
[03:53:07.845 --> 03:53:09.806]  Kamala Harris will not certify the election.
[03:53:13.086 --> 03:53:14.487]  They will not leave the White House.
[03:53:15.567 --> 03:53:15.907]  They won't.
[03:53:17.924 --> 03:53:20.505]  And then from there, my question is, where do we go from there?
[03:53:22.826 --> 03:53:28.409]  Because honestly, I think that's a legitimate scenario that we could end up seeing in November to January.
[03:53:30.189 --> 03:53:34.651]  And I did pose this question on X, you can follow me at DrewHLive, yesterday.
[03:53:34.671 --> 03:53:43.535]  And I saw a wave of naive, poor souls, poor souls, man, a wave of naive people.
[03:53:43.675 --> 03:53:45.556]  And it just caused me to shake my head.
[03:53:46.483 --> 03:53:47.703]  It caused me to shake my head.
[03:53:47.743 --> 03:53:52.685]  I saw a wave of people respond and say, well, it's the law.
[03:53:53.145 --> 03:54:00.107]  It's the law that they have to certify the election because Democrats were worried that Mike Pence might have not done it.
[03:54:00.427 --> 03:54:05.769]  So now they made it the law that the VP has to certify it, whether they believe in it or not.
[03:54:06.469 --> 03:54:06.909]  Ha!
[03:54:08.209 --> 03:54:08.930]  Ha!
[03:54:09.670 --> 03:54:10.110]  Yeah.
[03:54:10.865 --> 03:54:13.886]  Yeah, because Democrats abide by the law.
[03:54:13.966 --> 03:54:18.787]  No, they write and rewrite the law to fit whatever the hell their narrative is for that time.
[03:54:23.328 --> 03:54:24.209]  So I've been wondering.
[03:54:26.809 --> 03:54:29.850]  I think in that scenario, that's that in that scenario.
[03:54:30.830 --> 03:54:36.612]  And that's if we have a free and fair election, that's if the too big to rig theory is correct, which it could be.
[03:54:39.287 --> 03:54:40.428]  Brace for impact, America.
[03:54:40.568 --> 03:54:42.451]  Brace for impact.
[03:54:44.278 --> 03:54:49.400]  And because at that point they might have their excuses for full martial law emergency powers.
[03:54:49.720 --> 03:54:51.361]  This is a coup against our government.
[03:54:51.621 --> 03:54:52.961]  They're colluding with Russia.
[03:54:53.241 --> 03:54:56.222]  We told you that Vladimir Putin was an authoritarian.
[03:54:56.443 --> 03:55:02.185]  This is part of his agenda to take over the West and the United States using proxy Trump to do it.
[03:55:02.365 --> 03:55:03.745]  You guys have to understand.
[03:55:04.185 --> 03:55:06.206]  This is why we told you to support Ukraine.
[03:55:06.466 --> 03:55:09.567]  This is why we told you to give billions because now this is it.
[03:55:09.727 --> 03:55:10.048]  They're here.
[03:55:10.088 --> 03:55:10.928]  They're on the coast.
[03:55:12.896 --> 03:55:13.537]  I don't know, man.
[03:55:13.997 --> 03:55:14.277]  I don't know.
[03:55:14.317 --> 03:55:15.078]  You guys let me know.
[03:55:15.318 --> 03:55:16.379]  Am I overthinking this?
[03:55:18.800 --> 03:55:24.264]  Because I could fully see this scenario unfolding in the next few months.
[03:55:26.966 --> 03:55:30.308]  And you want to know who they want off the air if something like that happens?
[03:55:31.649 --> 03:55:32.410]  InfoWars.
[03:55:33.711 --> 03:55:34.591]  Alex Jones.
[03:55:35.732 --> 03:55:36.593]  Olin Schroer.
[03:55:38.174 --> 03:55:39.595]  Throw Steve Bannon in jail.
[03:55:41.027 --> 03:55:44.128]  Go after the Gateway Pundit, launch lawfare at them, which is happening.
[03:55:46.229 --> 03:55:47.670]  Shut down the Epoch Times.
[03:55:49.411 --> 03:55:50.571]  Shut down all dissent.
[03:55:51.872 --> 03:55:53.112]  That's preemptive, you know.
[03:55:55.273 --> 03:55:55.973]  That's preemptive.
[03:55:58.114 --> 03:55:59.255]  You know, in acts of war.
[03:56:01.656 --> 03:56:02.776]  Wartime strategy.
[03:56:05.197 --> 03:56:08.019]  Shut down all communications before we make our move.
[03:56:08.539 --> 03:56:08.699]  Why?
[03:56:09.341 --> 03:56:38.910]   So they cannot communicate to their people, they can't coordinate with their army on the grounds, and that it's total radio silence so that not only are we coordinating our attack, but we will be the ones to put out our narrative and our propaganda and our story so that the rest of the world that's listening will listen To what we want them to believe.
[03:56:39.170 --> 03:56:43.713]  And they will believe what we want them to believe about what's happening with this event.
[03:56:44.133 --> 03:56:45.173]  We can't hide the event.
[03:56:46.874 --> 03:56:50.236]  But we could dictate and we could rewrite how the event happened.
[03:56:50.256 --> 03:56:53.018]  So think about it.
[03:56:54.739 --> 03:56:55.920]  There are huge implications.
[03:56:56.000 --> 03:56:57.020]  I think they're making their move.
[03:56:57.040 --> 03:56:58.681]  I think that's why they've made their move on Trump.
[03:56:59.482 --> 03:57:01.443]  Throw Trump in prison or put him on house arrest.
[03:57:01.483 --> 03:57:02.704]  Keep him off the campaign trail.
[03:57:04.585 --> 03:57:05.485]  Shut down InfoWars.
[03:57:05.525 --> 03:57:06.506]  Shut down Alex Jones.
[03:57:07.719 --> 03:57:18.704]  Owen Schreier, Steve Bannon, Epoch, Gateway, simultaneously, preemptively, shut down their communication systems, and we will make our move.
[03:57:18.724 --> 03:57:27.928]  Alright guys, stay connected with me at DrewHLiveOnX, follow me on Rumble.com slash DrewHernandez, at RealAlexJones, the InfoWar never dies!
[03:57:30.069 --> 03:57:31.870]  Thank you for joining us here today.
[03:57:34.181 --> 03:57:40.746]  Earlier this afternoon, Donald Trump was arraigned by a Manhattan grand jury on 34 felony counts.
[03:57:41.507 --> 03:57:42.868]  This case is an abomination.
[03:57:42.988 --> 03:57:44.569]  You know, it's obviously political.
[03:57:44.649 --> 03:57:46.651]  Seven years to try to come up with this case.
[03:57:47.111 --> 03:57:48.432]  They're just wrong on the law.
[03:57:48.832 --> 03:57:53.176]  The only crime that Donald Trump is being prosecuted for is the crime of running for president.
[03:57:53.396 --> 03:57:56.840]  What's going on here is a disgusting disgrace!
[03:57:56.920 --> 03:58:00.263]  It is war on Trump, it is war on the Republican Party, and it is a war on the Republic!
