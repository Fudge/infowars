[00:00:01.121 --> 00:00:06.905]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:08.186 --> 00:00:12.510]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and support the InfoWars.
[00:00:33.384 --> 00:00:38.465]  By the way, he's doing it in the South Bronx, not to make a point, but because he's got court.
[00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:45.186]  And the man practically has the legal version of an ankle bracelet around him, and he can't leave the five boroughs because he always has to be in court.
[00:00:45.526 --> 00:00:59.509]  And so, it is truly an embarrassment to him, and I am looking forward to the response of everyday Bronxites talking about how they feel about him coming to their bench.
[00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:03.233]  Some public schools and libraries invite drag queens, some dressed like torn demons, to read to young children.
[00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.512]  Parents' rights are limited, and children's rights are put ahead.
[00:01:19.932 --> 00:01:24.714]  So the child has the right to be protected from the parents when the parents behave badly.
[00:01:24.734 --> 00:01:31.017]  Yeah, that child molester just messed with the wrong preschooler.
[00:01:32.538 --> 00:01:34.359]  What makes you think he's a child molester?
[00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:36.580]  Oh, he's a child molester, believe me.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.202]  Every child molester I've ever met looks just like that.
[00:01:49.296 --> 00:01:49.716]  What?
[00:01:49.756 --> 00:01:50.357]  That's fucked.
[00:02:08.183 --> 00:02:13.345]  And then you have talk show stars like Joe Rogan who just wing it, who make it up as they go along.
[00:02:13.665 --> 00:02:23.450]  And because figures like Rogan are trusted by people that don't trust real newsrooms, we have a tension, a problem that's much bigger than Spotify, much bigger than any single platform, Kate.
[00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.292]  But that's what's at the heart of this... Dammit, everything on TV sucks.
[00:02:29.292 --> 00:02:30.653]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:02:39.932 --> 00:02:40.855]  Fire!
[00:02:40.875 --> 00:02:41.477]  Fire!
[00:02:41.818 --> 00:02:42.119]  Fire!
[00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:01.239]  Hello?
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.520]  You piece of s***!
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.661]  You f***ing f***ing damn f***er!
[00:03:05.082 --> 00:03:06.022]  Listen, f***head!
[00:03:06.422 --> 00:03:07.843]  You have f***ing crossed the line!
[00:03:08.524 --> 00:03:11.125]  Get that through your f***ing damn f***ing head!
[00:03:11.165 --> 00:03:13.407]  Stop pushing your s***!
[00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:17.269]  We're gonna beat your ass!
[00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.031]  You just get that through your stinking traitorous heads!
[00:03:20.911 --> 00:03:25.034]  But I will stomp your head in if you start a fight with me, you thug scum!
[00:03:25.334 --> 00:03:26.815]  You think I'm a coward like you?! !
[00:03:28.843 --> 00:03:35.872]  Uh... I... We're... Uh... Whoa!
[00:03:36.592 --> 00:03:39.316]  I just got invited to give the commencement address at Harvard this year.
[00:03:39.536 --> 00:03:40.477]  That's amazing!
[00:03:41.218 --> 00:03:41.979]  I'm gay!
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.740]  Oh...
[00:03:56.238 --> 00:03:56.599]  Alright.
[00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:58.802]  So you get to wear the hat and everything?
[00:03:58.903 --> 00:03:59.203]  Nice!
[00:03:59.303 --> 00:03:59.824]  Don't worry.
[00:03:59.864 --> 00:04:00.165]  Hello?
[00:04:09.108 --> 00:04:10.309]  I see you, enemy!
[00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:11.289]  Enemy!
[00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:12.329]  Enemy!
[00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:13.930]  You are my enemy!
[00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.351]  You will pay.
[00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:17.391]  Yeah, you think I don't see your face, scum?
[00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:19.432]  You don't think I don't see you?
[00:04:19.452 --> 00:04:19.712]  I see you.
[00:04:19.732 --> 00:04:20.953]  You understand me?
[00:04:21.073 --> 00:04:23.094]  I know what you think of me and my family.
[00:04:23.274 --> 00:04:23.894]  I see you.
[00:04:24.094 --> 00:04:24.514]  Right back.
[00:04:24.574 --> 00:04:25.675]  You understand that?
[00:04:25.815 --> 00:04:26.995]  You understand that?
[00:04:33.918 --> 00:04:34.459]  Fool!
[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.082]  You will not bring humanity down!
[00:04:37.643 --> 00:04:40.486]  God is going to destroy you!
[00:05:17.791 --> 00:05:19.153]  It's Wednesday, May 22nd, 2024.
[00:05:19.213 --> 00:05:25.299]  Ladies and gentlemen, all hell's breaking loose.
[00:05:25.859 --> 00:05:28.902]  Stay with us.
[00:05:28.963 --> 00:05:33.087]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:05:37.475 --> 00:05:40.296]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[00:05:40.416 --> 00:05:41.757]  Let me think, just let me think.
[00:05:41.817 --> 00:05:47.018]  Even now, orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[00:05:47.038 --> 00:05:48.499]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:49.019]  Damn it!
[00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:49.399]  Why?
[00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:56.141]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:05:56.742 --> 00:05:59.883]  Words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen,
[00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:07.485]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:06:07.525 --> 00:06:08.486]  You designed it, sir.
[00:06:08.546 --> 00:06:09.467]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:06:09.487 --> 00:06:10.888]  You taught me every television in London!
[00:06:11.148 --> 00:06:14.591]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.
[00:06:15.052 --> 00:06:24.680]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and subverting your submission.
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.860]  Cameras.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.560]  We need cameras.
[00:06:25.901 --> 00:06:26.661]  How did this happen?
[00:06:27.342 --> 00:06:28.102]  Who's to blame?
[00:06:29.084 --> 00:06:31.728]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:06:31.748 --> 00:06:33.651]  They will be held accountable.
[00:06:33.671 --> 00:06:39.521]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:06:40.746 --> 00:06:42.287]  I know why you did it.
[00:06:42.367 --> 00:06:45.929]  I know you were afraid, cooling me.
[00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:47.509]  War, terror, disease.
[00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:54.553]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:06:54.593 --> 00:07:00.355]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:07:00.996 --> 00:07:07.159]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:07:13.885 --> 00:07:15.106]  There is a war.
[00:07:15.546 --> 00:07:16.547]  It's happening now.
[00:07:17.428 --> 00:07:19.229]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:07:19.809 --> 00:07:21.551]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:07:22.351 --> 00:07:23.832]  We are the Resistance.
[00:07:24.293 --> 00:07:25.894]  We are the Infowar.
[00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.731]  Woooo!
[00:07:38.472 --> 00:07:39.112]  Man!
[00:07:39.132 --> 00:07:40.733]  Oh-ho!
[00:07:41.574 --> 00:07:42.475]  Ha-ha!
[00:07:43.155 --> 00:07:48.680]  How could anybody say that they are not living in incredibly interesting times?
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.622]  I hear young people say, oh, things are boring.
[00:07:51.642 --> 00:07:53.703]  Well, that's because you're not paying attention, sonny boy.
[00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:59.188]  A lot of young folks are awake and they're great, but some of them and some old folks think things are boring.
[00:08:00.868 --> 00:08:03.469]  Well, that's because you're watching the crappy shows on Netflix.
[00:08:03.489 --> 00:08:10.992]  You're not out in the real world in the arena like President Trump and the spectacular things he's doing and Roger Stone and so many others.
[00:08:11.492 --> 00:08:20.475]  Roger Stone is joining us here in about five, six minutes with the inside scoop on the Mar-a-Lago raid with the plan to use deadly force against Trump and the Secret Service.
[00:08:20.855 --> 00:08:30.499]  He had the actual plan that the judge has released in Miami and they wanted the crossfire hurricane documents just like Roger said when the raid happened.
[00:08:32.125 --> 00:08:40.657]  Last year, and of course he got raided himself by 20 plus stormtrippers and helicopters and gunboats because he has no criminal record and never hurt anybody.
[00:08:41.818 --> 00:08:43.200]  Just like President Trump.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.562]  This is just insane.
[00:08:44.602 --> 00:08:46.725]  They were hoping for some type of violent confrontation.
[00:08:47.225 --> 00:08:48.267]  We'll be talking to Roger.
[00:08:49.102 --> 00:09:01.945]  In just a moment, this has really woken people up even more than all the fake indictments and all the fake civil trials and, you know, the selection at Cannes Film Festival about the young Trump raping women.
[00:09:02.005 --> 00:09:02.745]  None of it's true.
[00:09:03.445 --> 00:09:07.406]  But that's how desperate the Hollywood globalist leftist criminal W.E.F.
[00:09:07.426 --> 00:09:08.347]  crime syndicate is.
[00:09:08.387 --> 00:09:09.647]  But how's that going?
[00:09:09.667 --> 00:09:15.828]  We've got new developments on Klaus Schwab and why he left the W.E.F., both from mainstream news and my sources.
[00:09:16.468 --> 00:09:17.889]  That's coming up today.
[00:09:18.789 --> 00:09:27.855]  Also, the desperate left is like, Hitler, Trump, put out a campaign ad promising to restore Hitler to America.
[00:09:28.556 --> 00:09:47.288]  It's a popular template used of historical news articles about World War II, Pearl Harbor, Hitler, and then racing up to MLK and JFK, getting assassinated, and RFK, and just, you know, all of it.
[00:09:48.493 --> 00:09:53.818]  And a fan made a video and just showed historical headlines of the last century flipping through.
[00:09:53.838 --> 00:09:58.021]  And then just used that to then say what Trump's going to do in the future.
[00:09:58.382 --> 00:09:59.082]  And they go, look!
[00:09:59.382 --> 00:10:04.387]  There was a quote out of a US newspaper about unifying the Reich in Germany.
[00:10:04.467 --> 00:10:05.447]  That's Hitler!
[00:10:06.488 --> 00:10:08.370]  Because you flip through a bunch of newspaper articles.
[00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:09.931]  It's a very popular template.
[00:10:10.212 --> 00:10:11.553]  People instantly went and found it.
[00:10:11.813 --> 00:10:12.473]  A fan made it.
[00:10:13.632 --> 00:10:18.516]  Biden responded and said he is wanting to be Hitler and it was just hysteria.
[00:10:18.976 --> 00:10:22.899]  That's how desperate these people are.
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:24.801]  Oh look, man arrested too.
[00:10:24.861 --> 00:10:26.102]  What's that code word mean?
[00:10:26.302 --> 00:10:27.843]  Oh, World War II has begun.
[00:10:28.123 --> 00:10:29.765]  Oh, Trump wants to begin World War II.
[00:10:30.045 --> 00:10:32.507]  No, it flips through the historical
[00:10:33.997 --> 00:10:41.059]  There's so many, if you're not into TV and video editing, there are hundreds, really thousands, but hundreds of popular newspaper templates.
[00:10:41.639 --> 00:10:45.540]  And as soon as I saw that last night, I went, well that's a well-known, I've seen that newspaper template.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.221]  I tell the crew, can we use different ones, not the same ones everybody else uses?
[00:10:49.561 --> 00:11:00.764]  I mean, I'm not putting the crew down, it's just that they then superimpose Trump headlines over it with all these old headlines behind it, and they think you're so stupid now that that means Trump
[00:11:02.261 --> 00:11:05.964]  He wants to be Hitler because there was some headlines about World War II.
[00:11:06.225 --> 00:11:07.226]  Absolutely insane.
[00:11:07.426 --> 00:11:09.087]  That's coming up after Roger leaves us.
[00:11:10.228 --> 00:11:18.716]  We've got insane border news, over-the-top crazy UN World Treaty power grab news.
[00:11:20.598 --> 00:11:24.802]  We have news on central bank digital currencies at risk of failure.
[00:11:27.216 --> 00:11:30.037]  That's coming out of CNBC, New York Times, you name it.
[00:11:30.077 --> 00:11:31.417]  Wow, what's happening?
[00:11:31.437 --> 00:11:33.157]  Their whole New World Order is falling apart.
[00:11:33.497 --> 00:11:39.499]  Also, the EU is bragging about how they're censoring not just in the EU, but worldwide with their censorship control.
[00:11:39.739 --> 00:11:43.600]  It's like Australia is threatening to have, and Brazil, Elon Musk arrested.
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:44.780]  We've got all of that.
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:52.142]  Trump has rested his defense in the New York kangaroo show trial for Stormy Horseface Daniels.
[00:11:53.722 --> 00:11:56.323]  And that, of course, completely blew up, but it's a New York jury, so...
[00:11:57.253 --> 00:12:01.374]  Doesn't matter that Cohen admitted that he lied and stole money from Trump and Trump didn't know anything.
[00:12:01.754 --> 00:12:12.417]  It doesn't matter because, well, these juries are selected, but you can always cross your fingers and also know that no one with half a brain is buying it outside of a few enclaves in New York, D.C.
[00:12:13.057 --> 00:12:16.938]  and places like Austin, Texas, I'm sad to tell you, where I live has been taken over.
[00:12:17.818 --> 00:12:18.958]  So that's all coming up.
[00:12:20.078 --> 00:12:26.580]  But I wanted to get Roger on and we'll go to him in a moment to really drill in to this because people are really upset
[00:12:27.907 --> 00:12:29.591]  Learning that the FBI did this.
[00:12:29.611 --> 00:12:36.687]  For people that don't know about federal and state and local law enforcement, I've studied a bit of criminology and criminal law enforcement and how they operate.
[00:12:38.075 --> 00:12:38.275]  I don't
[00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:01.272]  I don't
[00:13:25.114 --> 00:13:31.375]  You don't need to worry about the Secret Service getting in a gunfight with the FBI, but that's what they said.
[00:13:31.415 --> 00:13:34.056]  They said, we may run into resistance from the Secret Service.
[00:13:34.716 --> 00:13:36.876]  We may have to kill other federal officers.
[00:13:38.297 --> 00:13:46.538]  So, that shows the Justice Department wanting to have a confrontation, really, really trying to make a crisis happen.
[00:13:46.558 --> 00:13:47.639]  We'll talk to Roger in a moment.
[00:13:47.739 --> 00:13:54.060]  And then, after Roger leaves us, I've mentioned what's coming up today and so much more as news breaks.
[00:13:55.421 --> 00:14:10.076]  But after Roger leaves us, just about 15-20 minutes, I could spend an hour on this, and I'm not going to today, but it's such a window into how the country really works in lawfare and the rest of it.
[00:14:10.937 --> 00:14:18.924]  I told you it was a critical hearing in federal court yesterday about the future of Infowars in Houston, and I wasn't there.
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:25.263]  But then I talked to my lawyers and others that were there after the hearing and they said they never seen anything like it.
[00:14:26.844 --> 00:14:35.310]  The Democratic Party that runs the operation to try to shut us down has literally told the judge, we don't want money.
[00:14:36.363 --> 00:14:37.684]  We just want to shut down Infowars.
[00:14:37.724 --> 00:14:40.406]  The judges, we keep telling them, well, that's not in the law.
[00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:43.188]  So whatever money's there, you get it, but then you got to move on.
[00:14:44.029 --> 00:14:45.710]  So they keep refusing to do that.
[00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:53.676]  We learned behind the scenes, we're trying to make deals to try to internally take over through the bankruptcy with the CRO and stuff that is here now.
[00:14:56.878 --> 00:14:58.659]  But that's just something they were proposing.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.301]  And the judge did something very rare.
[00:15:01.361 --> 00:15:01.881]  He just said,
[00:15:02.796 --> 00:15:04.821]  No, I'm not going to liquidate and shut down InfoWars.
[00:15:04.881 --> 00:15:09.653]  In fact, I'm going to give it back to Alex Jones if you don't settle with him by June 13th.
[00:15:13.931 --> 00:15:14.731]  I'm going to tell you all about it.
[00:15:14.931 --> 00:15:19.992]  But folks, so Judge Lopez was known as not a corrupt judge and a fair judge.
[00:15:20.012 --> 00:15:21.173]  He's a Trump appointee.
[00:15:21.993 --> 00:15:23.593]  And they were white-faced.
[00:15:23.933 --> 00:15:26.034]  They were gibbering and stuttering when they left.
[00:15:26.954 --> 00:15:28.014]  They didn't know what to do.
[00:15:29.214 --> 00:15:30.615]  And they're completely out of their minds.
[00:15:30.835 --> 00:15:33.435]  And now they're going to, this will take months and months to unfold.
[00:15:34.215 --> 00:15:40.897]  But down the road, somewhere around the election, Judge Guerra, the Democrat judge in Austin, the state judge,
[00:15:41.977 --> 00:15:42.897]  It'll go back to her.
[00:15:42.957 --> 00:15:44.238]  She doesn't follow any of the law.
[00:15:44.398 --> 00:15:46.178]  She stages events with HBO.
[00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:48.359]  You know, found me guilty and had a show trial.
[00:15:48.819 --> 00:16:03.404]  She will then probably just try to send in the local constabulary, the police, to try to just shut this place down.
[00:16:03.484 --> 00:16:06.045]  Obviously, you're not supposed to do that, but she does whatever she wants.
[00:16:06.085 --> 00:16:07.285]  That's going to be spectacular.
[00:16:08.486 --> 00:16:08.726]  So,
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.661]  Real fireworks coming.
[00:16:11.681 --> 00:16:13.022]  I don't mean we're going to resist them.
[00:16:13.042 --> 00:16:15.624]  It's just, it's going to be political fireworks.
[00:16:15.644 --> 00:16:21.547]  Can you imagine when she sends the constables in here to just shut it down because they don't want money.
[00:16:21.567 --> 00:16:26.291]  They want to shut down a successful, profitable company and they sit on the courthouse steps.
[00:16:26.311 --> 00:16:26.811]  We don't want
[00:16:27.904 --> 00:16:28.725]  Money, we want to shut him down.
[00:16:28.745 --> 00:16:37.369]  And it doesn't matter what the law says, they're going to try to use it to claim they're going to get the assets, some cameras and equipment and TV screens, instead of ever settling.
[00:16:37.429 --> 00:16:42.392]  So, naked absolute weaponization that also ties into what just happened with Trump.
[00:16:42.832 --> 00:16:44.033]  So, I'll give you the details of that.
[00:16:44.053 --> 00:16:45.214]  I'll kind of give you a little prelude.
[00:16:45.734 --> 00:16:47.857]  But I'm going to really walk through it after Roger leaves us.
[00:16:48.118 --> 00:16:49.940]  Roger, thanks for coming on on short notice.
[00:16:50.621 --> 00:16:52.764]  This is just absolutely insane.
[00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:57.071]  We'll show the FBI documents that they didn't want made public.
[00:16:57.371 --> 00:17:00.736]  This, of course, the same FBI working at the behest of Jack Smith.
[00:17:01.557 --> 00:17:09.119]  The illegally appointed special counsel who has already been excoriated for falsifying documents in the national security documents case.
[00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:13.780]  I mean, just, you talk about a Midas touch, everything you touch turns to gold.
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:18.702]  Everything the Democrats touch literally turns to shit in their face.
[00:17:18.742 --> 00:17:19.922]  So, Roger, thanks for joining us.
[00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:23.303]  Alex, thanks for having me.
[00:17:23.323 --> 00:17:25.304]  I apologize last night when you called me.
[00:17:25.364 --> 00:17:39.893]  I was a little froggy and I think we were both shocked by these revelations that Attorney General Merrick Garland authorized the use of deadly force in the raid on Mar-a-Lago, a raid over documents.
[00:17:40.713 --> 00:17:45.716]  Now, fortunately, President Trump was not in Florida, and I believe they knew that.
[00:17:45.836 --> 00:17:53.719]  So those today online claiming that this was a botched assassination attempt, I think that is a gross overstatement.
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.860]  Still completely inappropriate.
[00:17:55.901 --> 00:18:03.144]  But what this did do, Alex, was it triggered the PTSD that my wife and I both suffer from.
[00:18:03.604 --> 00:18:07.066]  Very clearly, deadly force was authorized.
[00:18:07.586 --> 00:18:24.779]  In the raid on my home on January 25th, 2019, when I answered a pounding on the door, looking down the barrel of two fully automatic M4 assault weapons.
[00:18:25.479 --> 00:18:32.965]  We know from the security tape, my home was completely surrounded by fully SWAT-clad FBI agents.
[00:18:33.745 --> 00:18:45.187]  And I remind you, Alex, that this was for an arrest for a first-time non-violent crime of allegedly lying to Congress in my voluntary testimony.
[00:18:45.607 --> 00:18:52.208]  So all they really had to do was to contact my attorneys, and of course I would have turned myself in.
[00:18:52.888 --> 00:19:01.870]  They claimed that I had to be arrested in this over-the-top way, the same way they claimed that they had to raid Mar-a-Lago.
[00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:12.418]  In my case, they claimed that I was a light risk, which is absurd because four hours later when I was arraigned, they asked for no cash bond.
[00:19:12.458 --> 00:19:16.041]  They allowed me to be released on my own recognizance.
[00:19:16.061 --> 00:19:19.404]  And of course, CNN illegally was tipped off to it and got caught lying about it.
[00:19:19.444 --> 00:19:24.688]  So absolutely, what do you make of Trump sounding the alarm over DOJ's deadly force order and Mar-a-Lago raid?
[00:19:24.728 --> 00:19:27.110]  Biden's a serious threat to our republic.
[00:19:28.371 --> 00:19:49.379]  What do you think the DOJ was thinking when they go to the former president, the real president's residence, one of the most, if not most beautiful country club in the world, and then they're in plain clothes, which could have had the Secret Service think they're being assaulted by an outside group, unannounced coming, treating the Secret Service like they're some Al-Qaeda organization.
[00:19:50.734 --> 00:19:52.935]  No, Alex, I think you're exactly right.
[00:19:53.076 --> 00:19:57.238]  You understand why the president is reacting to this the way he is.
[00:19:57.338 --> 00:20:07.285]  Look, as the judge in the Florida so-called documents case, Eileen Cannon, you know, who is a Cuban-American, who's a former prosecutor,
[00:20:07.965 --> 00:20:11.386]  Very highly respected as a prosecutor and as an attorney.
[00:20:12.267 --> 00:20:17.288]  The talking heads at MSNBC would have you believe that she's incompetent or unqualified.
[00:20:17.588 --> 00:20:18.749]  None of those things true.
[00:20:18.929 --> 00:20:20.909]  She is the thing they hate the most.
[00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:22.550]  An honest judge.
[00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:24.991]  An honest judge who goes by the law.
[00:20:25.471 --> 00:20:34.754]  And Judge Kannon has systematically worked to un-redact the vast majority of Special Counsel Jack Smith's case.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:43.548]  It's very clear that Smith does not want the American people to know exactly what documents we're talking about here.
[00:20:43.768 --> 00:20:47.672]  What documents was the government so desperate to get back?
[00:20:48.133 --> 00:20:54.860]  What documents did Donald Trump hold on to, I think consistent with law under the Presidential Records Act?
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.442]  Uh, that they wanted to get out of his hands.
[00:20:57.922 --> 00:21:09.552]  I continue to believe that they are the documents that prove the criminal conspiracy by the government in Crossfire Hurricane, and that that is what this is all about.
[00:21:10.072 --> 00:21:12.274]  But because of an honest judge,
[00:21:12.934 --> 00:21:18.138]  Who has systematically refused to allow Jack Smith to operate in secret.
[00:21:18.538 --> 00:21:26.104]  We now know that they authorized deadly force against the president and no FBI vests.
[00:21:27.351 --> 00:21:28.192]  Polo shirts.
[00:21:28.272 --> 00:21:29.153]  You're absolutely right.
[00:21:29.433 --> 00:21:37.619]  I don't have deep experience in law enforcement, but this was potentially an extraordinarily dangerous situation.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:45.705]  It's amazing how many people online tell me when they read about the raid in my home that they wish that I'd made a false move.
[00:21:46.025 --> 00:21:49.188]  They wish that I had been shot and killed.
[00:21:49.548 --> 00:21:50.829]  The worst part of this, Alex,
[00:21:51.569 --> 00:21:54.290]  And I'm sure Melania Trump can appreciate this.
[00:21:54.710 --> 00:22:08.656]  Just as the FBI rummaged through my wife's underwear draw, my wife's clothing, they rummaged through and took pictures of Melania Trump's personal effects, rummaged through her underwear draw.
[00:22:09.596 --> 00:22:36.645]  I can't think of any legitimate purpose for this, but I think it's important to recognize that as the so-called documents case in which they hope to lock Donald Trump up to convict him of a crime and lock him up prior to the election has essentially disintegrated because an honest judge wants the American people to see all the facts, which is why the special counsel then shifted his focus to D.C.
[00:22:38.928 --> 00:22:42.209]  And the authorization of deadly force.
[00:22:42.509 --> 00:22:46.070]  A lot of people online saying, oh no, this is standard protocol.
[00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:47.871]  This is normal.
[00:22:47.911 --> 00:22:50.792]  No, my sources tell me it is not normal.
[00:22:51.392 --> 00:23:02.295]  They also tell me that Attorney General Merrick Garland, I just saw a clip in which he says himself that he authorized this raid, which means he authorized every aspect of this raid.
[00:23:02.576 --> 00:23:03.736]  There you see it right there.
[00:23:04.256 --> 00:23:19.487]  By the way, the journalist Julie Kelly, who is on X, formerly known as Twitter, does an excellent job of grabbing these documents, figuring out what they mean, highlighting them as you've seen, and getting them out to the American people.
[00:23:20.228 --> 00:23:24.371]  Alex, I was shocked last night when I saw this, as I know you were.
[00:23:24.591 --> 00:23:27.292]  Well, I'm just surprised when I called you at 11 p.m.
[00:23:27.432 --> 00:23:28.873]  Central, midnight, that you answered.
[00:23:28.913 --> 00:23:34.355]  I was just leaving you a message, and you answered, and then said, sorry, I'm sleepy, but yeah, I'll come on, so I don't apologize for that.
[00:23:34.856 --> 00:23:35.896]  Thanks for picking up, Roger.
[00:23:35.936 --> 00:23:46.181]  But again, this is just like a cherry on top, whipped cream, nuts on top of this giant sundae of tyranny, and all it's doing is turning everybody against the system.
[00:23:47.335 --> 00:23:52.000]  The FBI, the Justice Department, all of them are total jokes, but they just keep doubling down.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:24:05.733]  What do you expect them to do now with the incredible fiasco that was the Stormy Daniels situation with Cohen just completely going belly up day after day on the stand?
[00:24:06.983 --> 00:24:13.146]  I'm really not surprised, Alex, because the Muller Grand Jury heard from Michael Cohen for hours.
[00:24:14.067 --> 00:24:19.549]  He, under oath before in the Senate and the House, made a number of false accusations against me.
[00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:24.812]  Yet the government never raised those in my trial, nor did they elect to call him as a witness.
[00:24:24.872 --> 00:24:30.675]  I think that's because they understood that he has severe credibility problems.
[00:24:31.695 --> 00:24:48.640]  And the bottom line of the New York trial, I think, is that former federal prosecutor Robert Costello, even though Judge Juan Merchant put substantial restrictions on the scope of his testimony, was a devastating witness.
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:55.022]  But the worst witness in terms of the impact on this case was Michael Cohen himself.
[00:24:56.022 --> 00:25:18.187]  As Jonathan Turley, the George Washington University law professor who does an online commentary, also writes for the New York Post, certainly not a conservative, not a Trump supporter, just I think an honest legal analyst, says that Cohen never connected Trump to these financial transactions, but the judge would not let
[00:25:19.148 --> 00:25:35.341]  A former chairman of the Federal Election Commission testify in Trump's defense, which is really quite extraordinary because that gentleman would have told the jury and the court that they had investigated this matter and there was no crime.
[00:25:35.381 --> 00:25:36.302]  Let's cut to the chase.
[00:25:36.642 --> 00:25:37.343]  What will happen?
[00:25:38.424 --> 00:25:43.229]  Look, I have been in this particular hot seat in a hostile jurisdiction.
[00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:59.564]  I think the chances of the President being acquitted, even though he should be acquitted, in fact the whole case should be dismissed, but I think the chances of him being acquitted with this many partisans and Trump-aters clearly on the jury is unlikely.
[00:26:00.505 --> 00:26:03.048]  But I also think that there's no slam dunk.
[00:26:03.428 --> 00:26:07.049]  For conviction because the government has not proved its case.
[00:26:07.089 --> 00:26:11.370]  In fact, I think they failed spectacularly in proving their case.
[00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:26.233]  So today, what we have to do is to pray for one or two honest, clear-headed, clear-thinking jurors who are going to be governed by the rule of law, who are actually going to
[00:26:26.873 --> 00:26:29.514]  Take into consideration... Roger, we've got to go to break.
[00:26:30.694 --> 00:26:31.374]  We've got to go to break.
[00:26:31.394 --> 00:26:39.836]  I'm going to talk about the huge attack on Infowars and the really good news and what the judge did speaking of good judges or at least decent, honest brokers coming up.
[00:26:39.936 --> 00:26:51.459]  Do ten more minutes with us, Roger, because I want to talk about the New York case you started getting into, the other cases, and they're all getting suspended or they're all getting basically defeated.
[00:26:51.479 --> 00:26:52.680]  What's going to happen in Georgia?
[00:26:55.265 --> 00:26:57.271]  Appeals Court now looking to remove her.
[00:26:57.872 --> 00:27:01.040]  That motion's been obviously, as you know, days ago, granted by the court.
[00:27:01.221 --> 00:27:02.444]  Everything is derailing.
[00:27:02.564 --> 00:27:03.727]  Everything is exploding.
[00:27:04.659 --> 00:27:05.579]  But these people don't give up.
[00:27:06.079 --> 00:27:08.160]  What do you expect them to do?
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.801]  We're going to go to break in a moment and come back with Roger Stone.
[00:27:11.861 --> 00:27:13.202]  Find him at StoneZone.com.
[00:27:13.522 --> 00:27:15.262]  Please don't forget that I'm Alex Jones.
[00:27:15.282 --> 00:27:29.387]  You can find us at InfoWars.com forward slash show and the other censored videos with a lot of other great contributors that are censored at Band.video and of course at RealAlexJones on X. It is essential for you to follow us at RealAlexJones on X.
[00:27:31.095 --> 00:27:40.104]  And to share the live show feeds every day, because we get usually about half a million views just on the live show feed after a day.
[00:27:40.144 --> 00:27:41.606]  That's a nice new group of people.
[00:27:41.906 --> 00:27:44.489]  We have, you know, four or five million that tune in just to the show here.
[00:27:45.049 --> 00:27:46.651]  And on radio stations, millions more.
[00:27:47.251 --> 00:27:49.293]  But then it gets picked up as clips everywhere.
[00:27:49.313 --> 00:27:53.757]  We're reaching tens of millions a day on X just through the clips from the show.
[00:27:53.777 --> 00:27:56.960]  So I want to keep encouraging people to share that and do that.
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.601]  And also, we'll put it on screen.
[00:27:58.881 --> 00:28:01.484]  Be sure and follow Roger Stone on X as well.
[00:28:01.764 --> 00:28:06.028]  That is so essential going into this election with what, 168 days left?
[00:28:06.528 --> 00:28:06.968]  Will be.
[00:28:07.108 --> 00:28:08.069]  Or how many days is it left?
[00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:09.250]  We'll tell you when we come back.
[00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:09.771]  Stay with us.
[00:28:10.091 --> 00:28:11.572]  Hey, I got some good news for everybody.

[00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:32.071]  This is the most incredible toothpaste ever.
[00:28:32.471 --> 00:28:33.972]  It's exclusively available

[00:28:48.058 --> 00:28:48.958]  He's produced it again.
[00:28:49.018 --> 00:28:49.758]  It's available again.
[00:28:49.778 --> 00:28:53.620]  A limited run at DrJonesNaturals.com.

[00:29:05.926 --> 00:29:16.490]  All right, I'm going to talk about something in another 10 minutes or so with Roger Stone that's really central to everybody out there watching and listening.
[00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:18.891]  And when I say this, I'm not lecturing you.
[00:29:19.952 --> 00:29:25.394]  I'm lecturing myself because it's a psychological phenomenon of how tyranny works.
[00:29:26.226 --> 00:29:29.089]  We've all heard of the frog in the pot, and it's a true story.
[00:29:29.409 --> 00:29:32.192]  In Louisiana and Mississippi, they eat a lot of bullfrogs, folks.
[00:29:32.252 --> 00:29:32.632]  I've had them.
[00:29:32.652 --> 00:29:33.293]  They're pretty tasty.
[00:29:33.313 --> 00:29:34.033]  They're fresh.
[00:29:34.394 --> 00:29:37.536]  They're boiled with a little bit of Cajun seasoning.
[00:29:38.197 --> 00:29:40.699]  If you throw a bullfrog into boiling water, he'll jump out.
[00:29:40.719 --> 00:29:48.767]  If you put him in cold water and slowly turn the heat up, he'll just sit there, and as it gets warm, it gets hot, he passes out, he dies.
[00:29:50.444 --> 00:29:52.806]  So we all know we're in tyranny, those of us that are awake.
[00:29:52.886 --> 00:29:53.447]  Some people don't.
[00:29:53.507 --> 00:30:02.034]  But a large portion of America, I'd say a majority now, overwhelmingly knows we got a corrupt, occupied government that's absolutely at war with us.
[00:30:02.795 --> 00:30:04.476]  But that's not enough to just know it.
[00:30:04.957 --> 00:30:13.164]  And then you can't just get used to whatever the new insane excess is as the tyrants double down and then say, oh sure, we know about it.
[00:30:13.971 --> 00:30:14.992]  And then just accept it.
[00:30:15.832 --> 00:30:17.413]  You've got to speak out against it.
[00:30:17.453 --> 00:30:18.654]  You've got to get upset about it.
[00:30:18.674 --> 00:30:19.514]  You've got to pray about it.
[00:30:19.855 --> 00:30:21.976]  You've got to vote against it.
[00:30:21.996 --> 00:30:23.777]  You've got to support lawsuits against it.
[00:30:23.797 --> 00:30:33.583]  And you've got to back the people in the media and in the government and in the corporations and in the churches and in education that are fighting the tyrants and in medicine.
[00:30:35.839 --> 00:30:37.080]  It's a battle of people.
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.760]  And I know I'm stating something really obvious.
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:39.941]  You're like, tell us something we don't know.
[00:30:40.561 --> 00:30:44.603]  But you've got to let it sink in, and so do I, that we're not in normal times.
[00:30:45.123 --> 00:30:50.505]  And it's not normal to be under this level of oppression and surveillance and bullying and tyranny.
[00:30:50.545 --> 00:30:51.266]  And our enemies...
[00:30:52.321 --> 00:31:07.125]  Continue to escalate, and they lose more power the tighter they squeeze, but there's not much more they can squeeze until you're in full martial law, assassinations, World War III, and they're trying to push not just Americans, but people all over the world.
[00:31:07.526 --> 00:31:15.448]  A bunch of criminals have arrogantly hijacked this country, and they mistake America's history and its power for their own.
[00:31:16.636 --> 00:31:24.310]  And that's why whistleblowers in the federal government, whistleblowers in big tech and whistleblowers in private industry and law enforcement and everywhere are so critical.
[00:31:24.972 --> 00:31:28.698]  The type of work that's being done by the different groups like James O'Keefe.
[00:31:29.864 --> 00:31:33.087]  And I'm stating the obvious, because we have millions of new listeners every day now.
[00:31:33.207 --> 00:31:36.270]  Every day, most folks tune in a few times, tune out, tune back in.
[00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:40.073]  I mean, the audience of people that we totally reach is in the billions overall.
[00:31:40.093 --> 00:31:44.577]  But every day, we're reaching tens of millions of people, and a lot of them are listening for the first time.
[00:31:44.937 --> 00:31:48.981]  So a lot of the show is not for those of you that have been listening 10 years, 20 years, 30 years.
[00:31:49.201 --> 00:31:49.561]  We love you.
[00:31:49.581 --> 00:31:50.082]  You're the best.
[00:31:50.362 --> 00:31:52.163]  You're the backers of this operation.
[00:31:52.904 --> 00:31:57.088]  But we're really here to get the prodigal sons that aren't fully aware of what's going on.
[00:31:57.108 --> 00:32:05.496]  But the level of lawfare, the level of election meddling, the level of election interference and theft is unprecedented in the annals of the world!
[00:32:06.383 --> 00:32:15.888]  I mean, and now the CIA and the Justice Department advise governments around the world, like Brazil, how to take Bolsonaro and others off the ballot and how to get Elon Musk.
[00:32:15.928 --> 00:32:22.592]  And the Feds are letting the EU go after our elections and after people that are backing speech like Musk.
[00:32:22.612 --> 00:32:23.253]  This is a big deal.
[00:32:23.473 --> 00:32:24.393]  Now, I've said my piece.
[00:32:24.874 --> 00:32:26.995]  Roger, in the time we have left, you got started before the break.
[00:32:28.001 --> 00:32:36.225]  I've asked you to kind of go around to the different civil and federal cases and where those are and the timing and how that's going to affect the election.
[00:32:36.985 --> 00:32:42.028]  Because now we're getting a pretty, pretty clear image of what's unfolding currently.
[00:32:43.809 --> 00:32:46.770]  Alex, timing is in fact the absolute key here.
[00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:50.332]  It's not lost on the American people, certainly not lost on us.
[00:32:51.098 --> 00:33:00.466]  That they waited until the fourth year of Joe Biden's presidency to try to bring these various civil and criminal prosecutions of Donald Trump.
[00:33:00.786 --> 00:33:13.577]  If Donald Trump actually was guilty of these many egregious crimes of which he is accused, none of which I think are legitimate, why would they not have done that in the first year of Joe Biden's presidency?
[00:33:14.098 --> 00:33:15.479]  The answer is, I think,
[00:33:16.059 --> 00:33:27.064]  That they believe that Trump would not be able to get re-nominated, therefore the danger of Trump, the disruptor, was no longer with us, no longer a problem.
[00:33:27.864 --> 00:33:33.307]  And to their surprise, he has staged one of the greatest political comebacks in American history.
[00:33:33.867 --> 00:33:49.607]  Originally, as I said, the so-called documents case in Florida, where they clearly, based on unredacted material, sent Trump pallets of documents he never requested, wait until they were certain they were in his possession.
[00:33:50.047 --> 00:33:52.848]  Then filed a criminal complaint that he had them.
[00:33:53.008 --> 00:33:54.228]  Just one example.
[00:33:55.148 --> 00:34:00.929]  Also informants, according to the unredacted documents on Trump's staff.
[00:34:02.129 --> 00:34:05.810]  Allegations that even one of Trump's attorneys was an informant.
[00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:10.871]  That was revealed in unredacted documents this past week.
[00:34:11.431 --> 00:34:16.492]  Unredacted government, pardon me, prosecutorial documents this past week.
[00:34:17.652 --> 00:34:23.515]  Judge Cannon, I think, is very clearly not going to schedule that trial.
[00:34:24.615 --> 00:34:31.759]  If it ever gets to trial, she's indefinitely postponed a trial date, but certainly nothing will happen this year.
[00:34:31.779 --> 00:34:41.643]  And there is still, by the way, a pending motion in that trial challenging the underlying authority of Special Counsel Jack Smith.
[00:34:42.273 --> 00:34:47.566]  Based on the fact that his appointment was never approved by the U.S.
[00:34:47.606 --> 00:34:49.251]  Senate, there was no confirmation.
[00:34:49.781 --> 00:35:04.048]  Former Attorney General Ed Meese of the Reagan administration has filed a very powerful amicus brief with two eminent law professors, neither one of whom are Trump supporters, arguing that Smith's appointment is illegal.
[00:35:04.889 --> 00:35:13.553]  If that were to happen in Florida, if that case were to be made and the judge would rule, well, it would void the charges against Trump in D.C.
[00:35:14.392 --> 00:35:30.997]  The charges against Trump in D.C., which do not include insurrection but seem to be centered around, quote-unquote, election interference, seem to have been filed as a reaction to the fact that the case in Florida was assigned to Judge Cannon.
[00:35:31.477 --> 00:35:50.429]  And therefore, finding a Clinton or Obama appointed judge like the one who previously dismissed the civil RICO case that Trump filed against all those involved in the Russian collusion hoax inside the Biden administration and the Clinton campaign had been dismissed.
[00:35:51.296 --> 00:35:54.539]  So I don't see that case going forward.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:36:00.425]  The Georgia case seems to be falling apart before our very eyes on multiple levels.
[00:36:00.485 --> 00:36:08.773]  There's an ongoing federal case pertaining to the election results before Judge Totenberg.
[00:36:09.473 --> 00:36:19.383]  Who seems to be willing to let the defendants make the case for election fraud based on machine malfunction.
[00:36:19.423 --> 00:36:21.185]  There's also a state case.
[00:36:21.966 --> 00:36:27.311]  It's becoming growingly clear that the underlying argument of the Georgia indictment
[00:36:27.791 --> 00:36:41.037]  That Trump lost Georgia, knew he lost Georgia, and plotted with others to try to hold on to Georgia's electoral votes falls apart because the underlying premise appears to be falling apart.
[00:36:41.437 --> 00:36:45.439]  Not to mention the credibility of Bonnie Wills, the prosecutor.
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.801]  Now you go to the most dangerous case in my
[00:36:50.138 --> 00:36:58.406]  Uneducated opinion from the point of view that I'm not a lawyer, but I know that you know way more than all those damn lawyers put combined come on stop it
[00:36:59.933 --> 00:37:00.674]  Look, D.C.
[00:37:00.754 --> 00:37:02.916]  is a killing field, Alex.
[00:37:03.396 --> 00:37:17.027]  No Republican, no free thinker, no non-Democrat, no independent, nobody who doesn't support the regime can get a fair trial in that jurisdiction.
[00:37:17.327 --> 00:37:19.228]  I've experienced this firsthand.
[00:37:19.609 --> 00:37:21.110]  So the question is simply this.
[00:37:22.271 --> 00:37:40.227]  The Supreme Court agreeing to hear the question about whether in fact Trump has immunity from prosecution has destroyed the timetable for those in the deep state who are desperate to convict Donald Trump of something, anything, something before the election.
[00:37:40.854 --> 00:37:44.557]  Do they know that these convictions will ultimately be overturned?
[00:37:44.597 --> 00:37:45.618]  Of course they know that.
[00:37:45.959 --> 00:37:49.802]  But as long as it happens after the election, they don't really care.
[00:37:50.242 --> 00:37:53.045]  It is election interference writ large.
[00:37:53.345 --> 00:37:55.027]  Here's the only thing we don't know, Alex.
[00:37:55.749 --> 00:37:56.389]  Will the U.S.
[00:37:56.470 --> 00:38:05.615]  Supreme Court rule in such a fashion that it would still allow them to bring Trump to trial in D.C., even in September and October?
[00:38:05.935 --> 00:38:09.097]  It would be unheard of in American political history.
[00:38:09.577 --> 00:38:16.362]  It's clearly a violation of the protocols and rules of the Justice Department, but I don't put it beyond those people.
[00:38:16.762 --> 00:38:18.383]  I pray, just as I pray,
[00:38:18.803 --> 00:38:31.351]  For one or two jurors to hang the jury in New York where the case has not been proven, I pray that the Supreme Court will do the right thing and end this national nightmare.
[00:38:38.735 --> 00:38:42.877]  Because in the court of public opinion, this is totally turning against him, plus it's the right thing to do constitutionally.
[00:38:43.258 --> 00:38:52.042]  Here's a quick clip of AOC admitting that these cases are an ankle bracelet on Trump to tie him down and keep him from being able to campaign.
[00:38:52.243 --> 00:38:54.124]  I mean, they're just out in the open.
[00:38:54.724 --> 00:39:01.568]  Biden, of course, a couple years ago said constitutionally, we're going to use law enforcement to keep Trump from being the next president.
[00:39:02.228 --> 00:39:07.891]  So, on one hand, they indict him for questioning an election legally, but on the other hand, admit they're doing it.
[00:39:07.971 --> 00:39:23.059]  Here's AOC, and I'm going to play back-to-back, one of many testimonies going on in Arizona by election workers who've sworn affidavits out of what they witnessed happening, not to mention in key Republican districts, sending two-inch-too-short
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:39.449]  Printouts so they couldn't run the ballots and then once they go and quote hand count them Miss certifying them and of course the person running for governor was in charge of that and you can't make up Conflicts of interest this bad.
[00:39:39.469 --> 00:39:42.191]  This is beyond a fox guarding the hen house.
[00:39:42.271 --> 00:39:47.374]  This is like the hen house being a fox's mouth So here are those clips back-to-back and I want your expert take on it
[00:39:47.776 --> 00:39:52.818]  By the way, he's doing it in the South Bronx, not to make a point, but because he's got court.
[00:39:53.138 --> 00:39:59.541]  And the man practically has the legal version of an ankle bracelet around him, and he can't leave the five boroughs because he always has to be in court.
[00:39:59.901 --> 00:40:14.007]  And so, it is truly an embarrassment to him, and I am looking forward to the response of everyday Bronxites talking about how they feel about him coming to their backyard.
[00:40:14.507 --> 00:40:17.388]  This is the dupli- excuse me, the duplication room.
[00:40:18.397 --> 00:40:26.904]  I observed with my Democratic partner, the preparation of a new ballot since the original one was soiled or wouldn't go through the tabulators.
[00:40:29.926 --> 00:40:32.408]  I read her a Trump Republican ballot.
[00:40:33.289 --> 00:40:42.556]  And as soon as she entered it into the system, the ballot defaulted on the screen to a Biden Democratic ballot.
[00:40:44.455 --> 00:40:50.558]  We reported this to the supervisors and others in the room commented that they had witnessed the same manipulation.
[00:40:51.518 --> 00:40:55.680]  We were never told what, if any corrective action was taken.
[00:40:56.441 --> 00:41:01.663]  All I know is the next day I was called outside the room that I was working in signature verification.
[00:41:02.856 --> 00:41:10.221]  By the supervisor saying, I understand you caused some problems this week and saying that you thought our machines were not working correctly.
[00:41:10.821 --> 00:41:12.582]  And I was being the one that was scolded.
[00:41:13.043 --> 00:41:25.010]  And I was told at that point in time, I could not discuss anything or talk about what was going on as many people were threatened because they were told that their voices would be suppressed.
[00:41:25.951 --> 00:41:29.633]  They would be either left, have to leave the room and not work there.
[00:41:32.679 --> 00:41:36.281]  Because I think this is our duty to speak the truth.
[00:41:37.342 --> 00:41:44.566]  In Pennsylvania, in Georgia, in Michigan, in Arizona, they covered the windows up so they could do their work.
[00:41:44.586 --> 00:41:53.091]  But the surveillance footage shows them taking the same groups of ballots, Democrat votes, running them over and over and over again.
[00:41:53.111 --> 00:41:55.552]  Then they have a kangaroo trial in New York against Giuliani.
[00:41:56.413 --> 00:41:58.754]  They fined massive amounts of money against him.
[00:41:59.915 --> 00:42:01.556]  And then they indict him in
[00:42:02.463 --> 00:42:06.666]  Arizona, they SWAT team him on his birthday to deliver it in Florida.
[00:42:06.726 --> 00:42:08.587]  Roger had been at the party last week, but he left.
[00:42:09.528 --> 00:42:12.870]  I mean, this is just unprecedented idiocy.
[00:42:13.591 --> 00:42:18.814]  This is just absolutely naked, and they don't seem to care.
[00:42:18.854 --> 00:42:26.319]  There's AOC betting everything on a jury where they vote 80 plus percent Democrats.
[00:42:26.719 --> 00:42:31.643]  It really is astounding to watch this unfold, Roger.
[00:42:33.416 --> 00:42:35.879]  Well, Alex, here's my message to AOC.
[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:39.223]  Hey, bartender, make me a martini.
[00:42:39.924 --> 00:42:44.409]  I mean, if there's anybody who's an embarrassment, it would be her.
[00:42:46.231 --> 00:42:50.016]  The Democrats are apoplectic that Donald Trump is going into the South Bronx.
[00:42:50.723 --> 00:42:55.625]  By the way, the last Republican presidential candidate who went into the South Bronx was Ronald Reagan.
[00:42:56.125 --> 00:42:58.386]  I was involved in that actual trip.
[00:42:58.786 --> 00:43:00.846]  That also paralyzed the Democrats.
[00:43:01.987 --> 00:43:17.032]  We are making great inroads among African Americans based on the failures of this administration and the fact that this illegal migrant invasion is taking away job opportunities, taking away affordable housing,
[00:43:17.552 --> 00:43:22.217]  From American citizens, many of them African Americans.
[00:43:22.818 --> 00:43:25.201]  This is being reflected in the polls.
[00:43:25.601 --> 00:43:32.048]  They are petrified that Trump is going right into the lion's den in the South Bronx.
[00:43:32.368 --> 00:43:35.852]  Now will there be paid demonstrators against him?
[00:43:35.912 --> 00:43:36.213]  Yes.
[00:43:36.653 --> 00:43:39.735]  But wait until you see how many supporters they are.
[00:43:39.775 --> 00:43:43.097]  I think this is going to be truly, truly historic.
[00:43:43.697 --> 00:44:01.968]  As for the broader question, Alex, anyone who will stop to look at the Supreme Court filing several weeks ago by Kerry Lake and others in Arizona, the claim that these electronic voting machines, which are computerized, cannot be penetrated through a back
[00:44:02.831 --> 00:44:03.532]  Well, that's right.
[00:44:30.914 --> 00:44:32.395]  They're losing the court of public opinion.
[00:44:32.435 --> 00:44:33.415]  Stonezone.com.
[00:44:33.876 --> 00:44:36.417]  Roger, one thing we know, Trump's the man in the arena.
[00:44:36.437 --> 00:44:37.078]  We're in the arena.
[00:44:37.118 --> 00:44:37.878]  The people are with him.
[00:44:38.278 --> 00:44:43.721]  And this is one hell of a time to be alive with, what, 168 days left until the most important election in world history.
[00:44:43.741 --> 00:44:44.442]  Thank you, Roger Stone.
[00:44:45.642 --> 00:44:46.443]  God bless you, Alex.
[00:44:47.762 --> 00:44:52.846]  All right, when we start the next hour, I got a ton of news and information and clips and so much to cover.
[00:44:52.866 --> 00:44:53.467]  Please stay with us.
[00:44:53.487 --> 00:45:01.393]  But let's talk about something really important, the First Amendment and the right of the people to be able to have their opinions and their ideas heard.
[00:45:01.973 --> 00:45:16.605]  Now, we now know the CIA and FBI and that the FBI General Counsel, the head lawyer in Connecticut, who testified to this in the show trials in Connecticut two years ago, created the lawsuits against me with Sandy Hook, had PR firms lie about me, make up stuff I never said and did,
[00:45:17.145 --> 00:45:29.656]  Then they had defaulted show trials where the judges found me guilty, put on HBO productions, the judge in Texas went to the premiere on a red carpet and was standing ovations as a movie star in the movie.
[00:45:30.777 --> 00:45:37.883]  So that's what they're doing to demonize the First Amendment and to destroy one of the main populist leaders against their system.
[00:45:39.158 --> 00:45:43.380]  Now, they also said I was hiding hundreds of millions of dollars and they were trying to shut down my companies.
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:45.762]  I declared corporate and personal bankruptcy.
[00:45:46.422 --> 00:45:53.546]  The court sent in three different investigation teams now for two years and said everything I said was true and that nothing they said was true.
[00:45:54.586 --> 00:45:57.368]  Now, Judge Chris Lopez in the Southern District
[00:45:59.144 --> 00:46:08.187]  Down in Houston, where we filed bankruptcy, is a Trump appointee, is a very fair judge, something that's very rare these days, more and more it seems.
[00:46:09.008 --> 00:46:26.614]  And the Democrats said in Connecticut, the Democratic Party, Akin Gump, the largest Democratic Party law firm that represents the Clintons, and George Soros, they said, and the plaintiff's lawyers in Texas and Connecticut said, we don't want money, we want to silence Alex Jones.
[00:46:26.654 --> 00:46:27.655]  I'll play a clip of that in a moment.
[00:46:28.615 --> 00:46:30.737]  Well, under the law, that's not what bankruptcy's for.
[00:46:30.817 --> 00:46:33.340]  It's whatever money's there, they give for their claim, that's it.
[00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:35.682]  They don't shut down successful companies.
[00:46:35.722 --> 00:46:37.444]  That's not how the code's supposed to work.
[00:46:38.376 --> 00:47:05.615]  Well, they went to the judge, and they said, we're not settling, and they also said they want to control what I say, and that's not in the law, and they thought the judge would just liquidate and shut down InfoWars at the hearing yesterday, and then he would announce a hearing on how it would be shut down on June 13th, and I told you about that, and I said, this could happen, because that's within the judge's power, if they have this fake billion and a half dollar judgment, which we have appeals going forward on, to do.
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:10.081]  The judge shocked my lawyers, their lawyers, everybody yesterday.
[00:47:10.441 --> 00:47:12.241]  I wasn't there, but my lawyers were there.
[00:47:12.301 --> 00:47:16.783]  I later listened into an audio recording that was online of the event.
[00:47:16.963 --> 00:47:19.363]  And then that's there for anybody that wants to go find it and see it.
[00:47:20.763 --> 00:47:25.965]  And the judge said, I'm not going to shut down InfoWars.
[00:47:26.005 --> 00:47:28.425]  I'm not going to shut down a successful company.
[00:47:29.486 --> 00:47:34.747]  I'm going to give it back to Alex Jones if you haven't settled with him by June 13th.
[00:47:36.826 --> 00:47:41.290]  Now normally every hearing he has within minutes is in Bloomberg, AP, Reuters, everywhere.
[00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:49.057]  Go to Google today and type in my name and there's nothing in there about the hearing yesterday.
[00:47:49.097 --> 00:47:53.121]  There's about me selling off my property and the rest of it, which I've been following the bankruptcy and done.
[00:47:53.141 --> 00:47:53.801]  It's done.
[00:47:55.022 --> 00:47:56.403]  Basically have my house, that's it.
[00:47:56.504 --> 00:47:56.724]  Fine.
[00:47:56.824 --> 00:47:57.665]  I don't care about that stuff.
[00:47:58.125 --> 00:48:00.067]  Piece of property, a little farm, whatever.
[00:48:01.735 --> 00:48:02.275]  Go to Google.
[00:48:02.515 --> 00:48:03.096]  Type in my name.
[00:48:03.436 --> 00:48:06.897]  Nothing there about the hearing yesterday because they don't know what to do.
[00:48:07.278 --> 00:48:08.438]  They don't know how to respond.
[00:48:08.478 --> 00:48:27.247]  Now, obviously, when he kicks it back out, June 13th, to the state courts in Guerra, who's just, in her own words, an actress in a show trial, and she goes to the red carpet events as the main selection at South by Southwest, I mean, any judge would be recused or even removed from the bench for that if it wasn't Travis County and the Democrats.
[00:48:27.267 --> 00:48:28.408]  This is just as bad as New York or D.C.
[00:48:31.158 --> 00:48:39.340]  And we'll do that when that happens, but I have no doubt with the corrupt courts and the Democrats and the rest of it, they may get us shut down, but not by the election.
[00:48:40.341 --> 00:48:40.721]  You see?
[00:48:40.781 --> 00:48:46.302]  And then I'll be able to go do something else, and hopefully whoever I get hired by will be able to bring the crew in.
[00:48:46.422 --> 00:48:47.383]  I haven't done any of that yet.
[00:48:47.403 --> 00:48:48.243]  I haven't made preparations.
[00:48:48.263 --> 00:48:49.563]  We're trying to save them from wars.
[00:48:49.983 --> 00:48:55.985]  So thank God for some justice in this country, and thank God for all of you and your incredible support over the years.
[00:48:56.485 --> 00:48:57.825]  But this is a big, big deal.
[00:48:58.246 --> 00:48:59.706]  So now it's more important than ever
[00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:13.260]  To support InfoWars.com, InfoWarsStore.com, to go get the great products that you need that are amazing, but that we have a war chest now to fight them and to keep InfoWars on the air, but we need the money to do that now because we've been given this reprieve.
[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:17.463]  It's like we were about to be executed next month, take another month to shut us down, we'd be gone in two months.
[00:49:17.824 --> 00:49:19.125]  Now, six months longer.
[00:49:19.585 --> 00:49:22.667]  And if we keep fighting, I believe God will give us another miracle.
[00:49:23.308 --> 00:49:25.009]  But I wanted to just have this on record.
[00:49:25.289 --> 00:49:28.152]  Here's a little short clip of Judge Guerra, the so-called little
[00:49:28.922 --> 00:49:30.824]  You know, vampire bat lady in little black robes.
[00:49:32.285 --> 00:49:37.750]  And then we'll go to a little compilation of them saying they don't want money, they want to silence us.
[00:49:37.770 --> 00:49:45.757]  They're just using the court system as a sham, as a fraud, claiming it's for these plaintiffs, claiming it's for people that were wronged, but they couldn't have a real trial.
[00:49:45.857 --> 00:49:48.359]  I couldn't put on evidence because I would defeat them.
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:53.204]  They had no evidence, nothing but talk and lies and things I never did and no one ever did to them.
[00:49:54.226 --> 00:49:59.808]  And then they raise all this money off of me and use my name for fundraising and then claim I made money off them.
[00:50:00.028 --> 00:50:01.268]  It's all the opposite.
[00:50:01.388 --> 00:50:02.349]  Run by the FBI.
[00:50:02.689 --> 00:50:03.669]  Run by the CIA.
[00:50:03.709 --> 00:50:06.090]  Not just the leaked video undercover.
[00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:07.630]  We have them admitting it in court.
[00:50:08.531 --> 00:50:12.452]  The FBI General Counsel in Connecticut initiated it.
[00:50:12.652 --> 00:50:13.492]  Went and got the suits.
[00:50:13.592 --> 00:50:14.553]  Organized the families.
[00:50:14.793 --> 00:50:15.693]  William Aldenberg.
[00:50:16.393 --> 00:50:18.174]  And so now we go forward with appeals and
[00:50:19.301 --> 00:50:22.983]  Lawsuits against the FBI and others.
[00:50:23.564 --> 00:50:24.124]  That's coming.
[00:50:25.124 --> 00:50:26.345]  So we're fighting harder than ever.
[00:50:26.365 --> 00:50:27.106]  Please stand with us.
[00:50:27.406 --> 00:50:28.767]  We're fighting just like President Trump.
[00:50:29.147 --> 00:50:30.548]  Here's the two clubs back-to-back.
[00:50:31.468 --> 00:50:43.135]  One of the things you've been talking about on your show is your allegation that government officials are aiding in pedophilia, child trafficking, and the grooming of children.
[00:50:43.415 --> 00:50:43.735]  Right?
[00:50:43.815 --> 00:50:44.215]  What do you mean?
[00:50:44.275 --> 00:50:46.537]  Like what Jeffrey Epstein did with the Clintons?
[00:51:02.838 --> 00:51:11.543]  I ask that with your verdict you not only take Alex Jones platform that he talks about away.
[00:51:12.403 --> 00:51:16.586]  I ask that you make certain he can't rebuild the platform.
[00:51:17.126 --> 00:51:18.107]  That's what matters.
[00:51:20.231 --> 00:51:30.360]  Take him out of this discourse, of this misinformation, of this peddling of lies, and make sure he can't do it again.
[00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:33.042]  That is punishment.
[00:51:34.063 --> 00:51:35.164]  That is deterrence.
[00:51:38.967 --> 00:51:41.029]  But somewhere out there right now is another thing.
[00:51:49.255 --> 00:51:50.176]  Think about the third kid.
[00:51:50.196 --> 00:51:54.579]  And there's gonna be a day when that child doesn't come home from school.
[00:51:54.839 --> 00:51:56.521]  And we know it, and it's sad, and that's the reality.
[00:51:56.541 --> 00:51:59.623]  And the question's gonna be, where is Alex Jones when that happens?
[00:52:02.085 --> 00:52:03.026]  Is he in the studio?
[00:52:03.066 --> 00:52:05.427]  Getting ready to pounce?
[00:52:07.509 --> 00:52:14.394]  Or will you stop him?
[00:52:14.454 --> 00:52:15.195]  That's gonna be your case.
[00:52:16.881 --> 00:52:22.463]  If we get it all done with all the evidence, we're going to come back here and ask the same thing.
[00:52:22.483 --> 00:52:25.504]  Because that's what justice is in this case.
[00:52:25.724 --> 00:52:30.606]  I hope that we never see someone like him again.
[00:52:32.446 --> 00:52:35.047]  I hope that with your verdict he can go away.
[00:52:35.067 --> 00:52:43.830]  Alex Jones is patient zero for our society's inability
[00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:46.838]  To speak without lies.
[00:52:48.506 --> 00:52:49.068]  I believe it.
[00:52:51.332 --> 00:52:55.896]  He is patient zero for alternative facts.
[00:52:56.476 --> 00:52:59.739]  Yeah, there's going to be a resolution made on what these claims are valued at.
[00:53:00.059 --> 00:53:05.843]  And that's also going to have to take into account what the Lafferty claims are valued at, and the Posner claims are valued at, and the Fontaine claims are valued at.
[00:53:06.384 --> 00:53:15.991]  And that is why I've been saying that what this is heading towards is there's going to be a large set of plaintiffs who are going to be dividing up the corpse of Infowars in the bankruptcy estate.
[00:53:16.311 --> 00:53:20.034]  And over the course of that process, that could get very, very dangerous for Mr. Jones.
[00:53:20.441 --> 00:53:23.644]  Because there is going to be a new level of financial scrutiny.
[00:53:24.305 --> 00:53:35.315]  And if, you know, some lawyer like me can basically find out that he's hiding the keys to the candy store, pull it out in front of him on the stand, I can only imagine what Federal Receipt is going to do.
[00:53:36.236 --> 00:53:38.038]  So yeah, it's going to get interesting from here on out.
[00:53:38.058 --> 00:53:40.100]  It's going to get really interesting, that's for sure.
[00:53:42.924 --> 00:53:43.825]  It's already super interesting.
[00:53:43.865 --> 00:53:47.027]  It's already super interesting, but like we say, it's the end of the beginning.
[00:53:47.928 --> 00:53:50.190]  And boy, are these clients happy about it.
[00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:53.553]  There was certainly a message sent out of this courthouse today, that's for sure.
[00:53:56.004 --> 00:53:58.586]  But we will be at it as long as it takes.
[00:53:59.307 --> 00:54:09.497]  And if you're out there right now and you're one of Alex Jones' audience members, and you're considering giving him money, I just want you to know that based on the jury's verdict today, it's not a very good bet.
[00:54:10.658 --> 00:54:12.920]  And to go back to what Robbie Parker said,
[00:54:14.364 --> 00:54:22.130]  All Alex Jones does is take from you, exploit you, lie to you, feed your fears and your anxieties and your mistrust.
[00:54:22.830 --> 00:54:25.713]  And the only person that benefits in that equation is him.
[00:54:26.413 --> 00:54:27.174]  Well, that stops.
[00:54:28.034 --> 00:54:30.796]  That's stopping today, thanks to the courage of these families.
[00:54:31.417 --> 00:54:32.117]  Thank you very much.
[00:54:32.558 --> 00:54:35.120]  Oh, but now the judge says that's not happening.
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:37.601]  Judge says that's not happening now.
[00:54:38.562 --> 00:54:40.343]  Oh, didn't go the way you thought it would.
[00:54:40.403 --> 00:54:41.104]  Too bad there.
[00:54:41.124 --> 00:54:41.985]  We'll be right back.
[00:54:42.005 --> 00:54:42.425]  Stay with us.
[00:55:03.459 --> 00:55:06.562]  Nitric Boost cleans out your blood, so good for your heart, your brain, everything.

[00:55:20.452 --> 00:55:21.513]  We're good to go.
[00:55:43.268 --> 00:55:45.811]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalists.
[00:55:46.191 --> 00:55:48.533]  And people can't identify who's a patron and who isn't.
[00:55:48.874 --> 00:55:52.017]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalists.
[00:55:52.077 --> 00:55:54.979]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:56:05.810]  That's why I designed this amazing 1776 red, white, and blue Gadsden flag shirt so you can support the Info War and meet like-minded people everywhere when you wear it.

[00:56:35.983 --> 00:56:39.767]  Spread the word, meet like-minded people, and fund the 1776 revolution worldwide.
[00:56:43.488 --> 00:56:46.369]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, the U.S.
[00:56:46.429 --> 00:56:54.673]  resistance against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[00:56:55.153 --> 00:56:57.634]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[00:56:57.654 --> 00:56:59.095]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[00:56:59.455 --> 00:57:01.337]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[00:57:01.617 --> 00:57:03.719]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[00:57:03.959 --> 00:57:05.020]  This is all confirmed.
[00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:06.001]  This is not a drill.
[00:57:06.161 --> 00:57:10.064]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[00:57:10.425 --> 00:57:11.846]  They've officially become state-run.
[00:57:11.966 --> 00:57:12.447]  Apple 100%.
[00:57:12.847 --> 00:57:18.452]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[00:57:18.912 --> 00:57:23.693]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[00:57:23.993 --> 00:57:24.833]  This is happening.
[00:57:24.873 --> 00:57:32.795]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[00:57:32.875 --> 00:57:38.837]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[00:57:39.237 --> 00:57:47.199]  This is a titrated dose reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation.
[00:57:48.099 --> 00:57:51.621]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[00:57:51.681 --> 00:57:55.403]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[00:57:55.423 --> 00:58:02.466]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[00:58:02.686 --> 00:58:05.347]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[00:58:05.708 --> 00:58:10.450]  Total Internet of Things, integration, global social score, complete command and control system.
[00:58:10.930 --> 00:58:12.571]  It is the virtual reality AI.
[00:58:12.771 --> 00:58:19.374]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[00:58:33.192 --> 00:58:41.920]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception, where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:46.844]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[00:58:47.224 --> 00:58:52.109]  I'm a person that cares about life and children, and is against these wars, and so they make me a herder of children.
[00:58:52.469 --> 00:59:00.131]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[00:59:00.652 --> 00:59:07.394]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they'd now use me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[00:59:07.814 --> 00:59:13.175]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you.
[00:59:13.395 --> 00:59:18.117]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[00:59:18.137 --> 00:59:20.218]  I have given you the transmission!
[00:59:20.338 --> 00:59:21.298]  Now break free!
[00:59:25.021 --> 00:59:33.724]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:59:34.304 --> 00:59:35.544]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:59:37.085 --> 00:59:40.866]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:59:40.906 --> 00:59:41.546]  We are live!
[00:59:44.047 --> 00:59:45.027]  Wednesday, May 22nd.
[00:59:45.528 --> 00:59:59.452]  All of us see the sunset, or beautiful snow-covered mountains, or shooting stars, or little fish in a pool, or beautiful jungle plants, or a cute little baby, you know, in its mother's arms, and you recognize goodness.
[00:59:59.992 --> 01:00:01.633]  You recognize wholesomeness.
[01:00:02.093 --> 01:00:08.935]  You recognize things God made that we communally share in God's creation, and we worship our Heavenly Father.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:19.205]  He's given us the system of Genesis that is our mother, but it is God, the Godhead, the male energy of will and building and striving.
[01:00:21.066 --> 01:00:24.708]  I'm just high on creation, man.
[01:00:32.452 --> 01:00:36.654]  I can't handle how alive I am right now in the fight against these tyrants.
[01:00:38.106 --> 01:00:47.234]  And how hard I'm gonna push to go after him because I'm so full of life and so full of resistance to these murdering pedophiles who want to get in the way of God's plan!
[01:00:52.539 --> 01:01:01.207]  But I tell you, anybody tries to get in the way of the incredible plan the big guy's got for us has got me pissed and I'm just begging to stay on the team, man.
[01:01:06.201 --> 01:01:07.382]  Just put me in the game, coach.
[01:01:07.582 --> 01:01:08.503]  Whatever you say, coach.
[01:01:08.723 --> 01:01:09.363]  I know I'm weak.
[01:01:09.483 --> 01:01:10.164]  I know I'm pathetic.
[01:01:10.364 --> 01:01:11.085]  Man, you're amazing.
[01:01:11.205 --> 01:01:12.125]  I'm so lucky you made me.
[01:01:12.526 --> 01:01:13.446]  What do I do, boss?
[01:01:13.646 --> 01:01:14.247]  What do I do?
[01:01:15.588 --> 01:01:16.529]  I'm like a hunting dog, man.
[01:01:16.769 --> 01:01:17.749]  Just take me out of the house.
[01:01:17.909 --> 01:01:18.670]  Just turn me on them.
[01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:19.811]  Tell me what I gotta do.
[01:01:19.991 --> 01:01:20.591]  Tell me why.
[01:01:20.611 --> 01:01:21.572]  Tell me how I serve you.
[01:01:21.732 --> 01:01:23.474]  Tell me what I can do for you right now!
[01:01:24.794 --> 01:01:25.455]  Woo!
[01:01:26.316 --> 01:01:32.540]  We're back in 60 seconds.
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:33.381]  We join stations.
[01:01:33.421 --> 01:01:33.781]  Get ready.
[01:01:33.821 --> 01:01:34.762]  Massive news straight ahead.
[01:01:36.912 --> 01:01:45.279]  So we've got a collection of powerful corporations controlled by private central banks that have been able to create unlimited fake money for themselves to buy out the planet.
[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:57.109]  And they are now all over the news and in action shutting down the infrastructure of our planet.
[01:01:57.989 --> 01:02:00.271]  Shutting off the farms, the ranches.
[01:02:02.013 --> 01:02:03.354]  Shutting off the
[01:02:05.031 --> 01:02:17.796]  Food supply and then saying we're going to ban all the traditional farming and all the traditional ranching and we're going to make you eat laboratory printed meat.
[01:02:17.856 --> 01:02:19.096]  In fact, I didn't see it in the clips.
[01:02:19.136 --> 01:02:19.736]  Maybe it's there.
[01:02:20.237 --> 01:02:22.678]  I posted it on X last night.
[01:02:22.858 --> 01:02:24.638]  It's in Israel with Benjamin Netanyahu.
[01:02:24.678 --> 01:02:25.539]  Will you guys go grab it?
[01:02:26.619 --> 01:02:28.020]  It's in Hebrew, but it's got subtitles.
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:28.980]  The two minute club.
[01:02:30.117 --> 01:02:45.421]  And they're talking about, well, you know, we're going to ban all the other meat that's bad for the earth, and we're going to give you fish and steaks, which aren't fish and steaks, printed by a machine from grown lab cells, and we're going to make you eat that because it's good for the environment.
[01:02:45.461 --> 01:02:47.081]  It's not good for the environment.
[01:02:47.761 --> 01:02:54.183]  It's them outlawing everything that's natural and good and forcing this globalist system down our throats.
[01:02:54.263 --> 01:02:55.203]  Let me know when you get that clip.
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:02:58.860]  It's insane.
[01:02:59.361 --> 01:03:01.742]  But let's tie all this together right now.
[01:03:02.462 --> 01:03:03.083]  Overhead shot.
[01:03:04.544 --> 01:03:07.465]  The globalists have suffered some big issues so far this year.
[01:03:07.525 --> 01:03:08.986]  Jacob Rothschild's dead.
[01:03:09.467 --> 01:03:10.667]  David Rockefeller died.
[01:03:10.687 --> 01:03:11.748]  Henry Kissinger died.
[01:03:12.268 --> 01:03:15.590]  Klaus Schwab steps down as Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum.
[01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:20.273]  They admit because of massive backlash against him and everybody turning against the forum.
[01:03:20.813 --> 01:03:22.974]  Mitch McConnell steps down as Senate Republican leader.
[01:03:24.035 --> 01:03:25.996]  Victoria Nuland resigns from the U.S.
[01:03:26.016 --> 01:03:27.217]  government, running the Ukraine war.
[01:03:28.311 --> 01:03:32.715]  Leo Bandeker resigns as the Irish Prime Minister.
[01:03:34.236 --> 01:03:36.918]  Humza Yousaf steps down as Scottish First Minister.
[01:03:37.058 --> 01:03:39.620]  Iranian President Rezaei dies in helicopter crash.
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:42.482]  Gert Wilders forms right-wing government in the Netherlands.
[01:03:43.603 --> 01:03:46.526]  Let's hope it keeps going this way.
[01:03:46.546 --> 01:03:50.148]  And that's a very small smattering that this poster on X put out.
[01:03:50.168 --> 01:03:55.713]  80 plus percent of elections around the world are being won by populist anti-globalists.
[01:03:56.385 --> 01:03:59.888]  And the places they're not winning is like we're Brazil, where they just ban the opposition.
[01:04:01.310 --> 01:04:02.891]  So, what else is happening?
[01:04:04.753 --> 01:04:06.054]  Just today, happening.
[01:04:06.074 --> 01:04:07.956]  I told you last week it was going to happen.
[01:04:08.937 --> 01:04:22.109]  EcoHealth Alliance, Dr. Daszak, that's the front man for Fauci and Gates, loses funding to be debarred by
[01:04:24.366 --> 01:04:29.749]  Health and Human Services remove his accreditation by being disbarred as a lawyer.
[01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:33.232]  And here's the letter from the Department of Health and Human Services.
[01:04:33.252 --> 01:04:38.975]  So they're getting ready to flush that minion down the toilet as a sacrificial lamb.
[01:04:40.516 --> 01:04:41.377]  He's certainly guilty.
[01:04:41.397 --> 01:04:44.819]  He's not a patsy, but he's finding out what's happening.
[01:04:45.259 --> 01:04:47.961]  Dr. Peter Daszak, Central and the COVID-19 Origin Research.
[01:04:47.981 --> 01:04:48.801]  I mean, it's on record.
[01:04:48.821 --> 01:04:49.222]  They had it.
[01:04:49.262 --> 01:04:49.662]  They made it.
[01:04:50.022 --> 01:04:51.063]  Suspended and facing
[01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:54.551]  Debarment by the HHS immediate funding.
[01:04:55.291 --> 01:04:55.591]  Cut!
[01:04:56.091 --> 01:04:57.991]  Eliminates his access to taxpayer money.
[01:04:58.351 --> 01:04:59.812]  Halting his dangerous experiments.
[01:04:59.832 --> 01:05:01.312]  So that's putting it lightly.
[01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:04.573]  So.
[01:05:06.453 --> 01:05:07.593]  Another one bites the dust.
[01:05:07.993 --> 01:05:08.733]  And another one.
[01:05:08.934 --> 01:05:09.614]  And another one.
[01:05:09.794 --> 01:05:11.034]  And another one bites the dust.
[01:05:11.834 --> 01:05:15.495]  Now let me get into lab-grown meat before I hit all this other huge news that ties into that.
[01:05:15.935 --> 01:05:16.735]  This huge story.
[01:05:17.355 --> 01:05:18.836]  The government, the U.S.
[01:05:18.956 --> 01:05:20.496]  government cartel
[01:05:22.625 --> 01:05:23.946]  That's the mainstream headline.
[01:05:25.568 --> 01:05:30.512]  Paid billions to Walgreens and CBS not to fill Ivermectin.
[01:05:31.313 --> 01:05:36.638]  Wow, because they knew it would help people 99% of the time if they got to you early enough.
[01:05:36.658 --> 01:05:37.859]  100% of the time.
[01:05:39.621 --> 01:05:45.346]  And so they paid them to not fill it so people would die.
[01:05:48.584 --> 01:05:49.365]  Isn't that cute?
[01:05:50.126 --> 01:05:51.107]  We'll get to that in a moment.
[01:05:51.447 --> 01:05:52.668]  But first, I mentioned this.
[01:05:53.269 --> 01:05:54.951]  I know most of us don't speak Hebrew.
[01:05:54.971 --> 01:05:55.611]  I know I don't.
[01:05:56.292 --> 01:06:02.438]  But this is on Israeli TV with a company called Stakeholder.
[01:06:02.498 --> 01:06:04.440]  That's another globalist WEF term.
[01:06:06.683 --> 01:06:08.564]  And you got Bill Gates financing this.
[01:06:08.584 --> 01:06:10.847]  The ESG's BlackRock will give you unlimited money.
[01:06:12.119 --> 01:06:14.860]  To try to make people eat lab-grown meat.
[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:16.640]  They go, oh, this is live cells.
[01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:18.201]  Oh, we're the only company with live cells.
[01:06:18.461 --> 01:06:19.181]  That's a lie, too.
[01:06:19.441 --> 01:06:26.704]  There's hundreds of these companies being financed to try to, where they grow these giant vats.
[01:06:27.004 --> 01:06:28.164]  It's a cloning operation.
[01:06:28.784 --> 01:06:33.346]  Cells of fish, of pigs, of cows, of ducks, of whatever you want.
[01:06:34.326 --> 01:06:40.488]  And then it's extruded in these pipes down into a printer.
[01:06:41.869 --> 01:06:44.771]  That then prints the meat that's not meat.
[01:06:44.951 --> 01:06:46.171]  They keep calling it chicken.
[01:06:46.211 --> 01:06:47.452]  They keep calling it beef.
[01:06:47.912 --> 01:06:48.293]  It's not.
[01:06:48.553 --> 01:06:52.195]  And Netanyahu's getting this tiny piece of grouper to eat that's not grouper.
[01:06:52.655 --> 01:06:53.756]  And he's like, ugh, eating it.
[01:06:53.776 --> 01:06:54.656]  Oh, it's so delicious.
[01:06:54.676 --> 01:06:56.657]  And he can barely force it down.
[01:06:59.299 --> 01:07:03.261]  But notice, if you read the post-captioning,
[01:07:05.083 --> 01:07:11.647]  The company head is, oh, and this isn't bad for the environment, and that's not bad, and, you know, we're going to have to get rid of this and get rid of that.
[01:07:12.468 --> 01:07:18.152]  Getting rid of everything, getting rid of the combustion engine, toxic batteries, all of it.
[01:07:19.372 --> 01:07:23.915]  And now they're announcing blackouts are going to happen this summer because there's not enough power because they cut off so many of the power plants.
[01:07:24.536 --> 01:07:25.737]  So let's go ahead and roll this.
[01:07:26.817 --> 01:07:28.478]  And I'm not going to start and stop because we don't have time.
[01:07:28.919 --> 01:07:33.302]  So I'm going to try to speed read what they're saying in Hebrew for radio listeners.
[01:07:34.287 --> 01:07:39.409]  Obviously, TV viewers should just read the closed captioning, but I'm going to try it for radio listeners.
[01:07:39.429 --> 01:07:40.629]  We're on over 300 radio stations.
[01:07:40.649 --> 01:07:41.650]  I'm going to try to read this.
[01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:42.170]  Go ahead and roll it.
[01:07:43.610 --> 01:07:46.131]  This is an industrial printer that we developed.
[01:07:47.472 --> 01:07:49.692]  It replaces slaughterhouses.
[01:07:50.893 --> 01:07:53.754]  Here, we load this printer with fat and muscle cells.
[01:07:53.794 --> 01:07:54.194]  Hit pause.
[01:07:56.101 --> 01:07:56.802]  Back it up one second.
[01:07:57.543 --> 01:07:58.664]  See, it's the PETA talk.
[01:07:58.865 --> 01:08:00.387]  Oh, we replaced slaughterhouses.
[01:08:00.407 --> 01:08:01.148]  Nothing's hurt.
[01:08:01.609 --> 01:08:03.091]  See, they're gonna use the animal rights movement.
[01:08:03.391 --> 01:08:06.856]  And then it gets into carbon, and how it's clean, how it's carbon neutral.
[01:08:06.936 --> 01:08:08.278]  All this made-up crap.
[01:08:09.505 --> 01:08:14.209]  As if energy isn't coming from a coal plant or another plant to power this giant machine.
[01:08:14.389 --> 01:08:19.172]  And imagine how dirty it gets putting these vats of synthetic cells in.
[01:08:19.192 --> 01:08:20.453]  Who knows what they're going to put into it.
[01:08:20.774 --> 01:08:23.456]  And of course the culture cells they grow it from are super toxic.
[01:08:23.636 --> 01:08:29.400]  There's been mainline studies and stuff about how toxic and full of bacteria and viruses this is.
[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:30.981]  It's almost like a vaccine factory.
[01:08:31.522 --> 01:08:31.922]  Continue.
[01:08:33.683 --> 01:08:35.124]  We load this printer with fat and muscle cells.
[01:08:39.090 --> 01:08:40.451]  Cable to print tons a day.
[01:08:42.012 --> 01:08:42.332]  Tons.
[01:08:42.392 --> 01:08:43.452]  Tons of cultivated meat per day.
[01:08:45.613 --> 01:08:53.897]  Just for the sake of illustration, you can select your steak and the printer releasing steaks at an industrial scale.
[01:08:54.157 --> 01:08:57.979]  It's just like the airport where there's no waiter, no humans, it's like robots making it.
[01:08:59.298 --> 01:09:00.519]  You type it into a computer.
[01:09:01.339 --> 01:09:03.561]  Releasing stakes at an industrial pace.
[01:09:03.661 --> 01:09:04.902]  They're not stakes!
[01:09:05.682 --> 01:09:06.243]  That's false!
[01:09:06.363 --> 01:09:07.283]  And here's the key.
[01:09:07.643 --> 01:09:09.845]  There's no regulations in Israel or the U.S.
[01:09:09.885 --> 01:09:14.748]  or anywhere about this fake meat, them calling it meat, the false advertising.
[01:09:14.928 --> 01:09:18.250]  There's all these regulations on beef and poultry and all of it.
[01:09:19.451 --> 01:09:25.255]  But no regulations when it comes to this because the globalists control the regulators and they're not creating regulations.
[01:09:26.189 --> 01:09:33.037]  Two years ago, the FDA said, oh, we're going to allow nanotech to be put in your meat and not even tell you.
[01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:38.003]  Continue.
[01:09:38.043 --> 01:09:41.106]  Sirloin, I don't know how you like your fat percentage.
[01:09:41.587 --> 01:09:43.289]  It's not sirloin.
[01:09:43.549 --> 01:09:45.151]  I'll choose the middle, middle here.
[01:09:48.271 --> 01:09:48.891]  Applied to print.
[01:09:49.672 --> 01:09:52.854]  And this is where the printer actually starts producing steaks.
[01:09:53.555 --> 01:09:54.595]  It doesn't produce steaks.
[01:09:54.735 --> 01:09:56.316]  It produces bacteria and crap.
[01:09:56.597 --> 01:09:57.537]  Stakeholder.
[01:09:57.557 --> 01:10:02.040]  The uniqueness here is that the cells remain alive after they're printed.
[01:10:02.621 --> 01:10:03.982]  A steak will be ready in about a minute.
[01:10:04.862 --> 01:10:06.143]  A minute, a minute.
[01:10:06.904 --> 01:10:09.625]  The process here is equivalent to that phase.
[01:10:09.826 --> 01:10:14.789]  Since the cow was born, it grows for two years, during which it pollutes the world.
[01:10:16.328 --> 01:10:17.409]  We make the process much shorter.
[01:10:17.549 --> 01:10:18.069]  Pause again.
[01:10:19.049 --> 01:10:22.491]  Oh, a cow living and eating grass is bad for the earth.
[01:10:22.511 --> 01:10:23.772]  See, all carbon's bad.
[01:10:23.992 --> 01:10:28.034]  But with his bacteria vats, his cell vats, they're safe, they're good.
[01:10:28.454 --> 01:10:30.235]  Listen, no land, no water.
[01:10:31.335 --> 01:10:34.797]  Really, you gotta have land, factories, you gotta bring in water, bring in the cell cultures.
[01:10:34.837 --> 01:10:35.657]  That's all lies!
[01:10:36.498 --> 01:10:39.059]  No land, no water, no carbon footprint, no emissions.
[01:10:39.079 --> 01:10:39.439]  Continue.
[01:10:42.499 --> 01:10:48.844]  This is the future McDonald's.
[01:10:49.765 --> 01:10:52.407]  Yes, this is the butcher of the slaughterhouse of the future.
[01:10:52.427 --> 01:10:53.788]  That's food.
[01:10:55.089 --> 01:10:58.052]  And the surprise is that we're launching the semi-industrial printer today.
[01:11:00.053 --> 01:11:02.755]  Let's move on to our second printer that prints a fish.
[01:11:02.936 --> 01:11:07.479]  It's not a fish.
[01:11:07.499 --> 01:11:09.481]  The printer prints a product that is ready to cook.
[01:11:10.924 --> 01:11:14.645]  Contains real cells.
[01:11:15.525 --> 01:11:16.746]  We print a grouper fillet.
[01:11:17.666 --> 01:11:20.827]  There is no other company that knows how to do something like this.
[01:11:20.847 --> 01:11:22.147]  Contains real fish cells.
[01:11:24.928 --> 01:11:28.208]  A grouper with complex texture.
[01:11:29.789 --> 01:11:31.909]  I will show you it ready, how it looks.
[01:11:37.351 --> 01:11:38.791]  You will also taste it for a moment.
[01:11:40.242 --> 01:11:43.505]  A cultured grouper fillet that is printed without using the fish itself.
[01:11:46.508 --> 01:11:46.988]  Pause.
[01:11:47.268 --> 01:11:59.619]  So they get fish cells, they clone them in a giant, basically, vaccine facility, in a giant cultured genetic, and then they feed you that, and they claim, oh, it doesn't hurt the earth, oh, it's so good, and then Netanyahu eats it.
[01:11:59.999 --> 01:12:02.061]  You know, in the real world, Netanyahu's not gonna be eating that.
[01:12:04.563 --> 01:12:05.965]  I mean, how is this kosher?
[01:12:07.932 --> 01:12:12.675]  I wonder if the rabbis go bless this as kosher.
[01:12:13.276 --> 01:12:18.760]  Continue.
[01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:20.561]  First time in the world that such a thing has happened.
[01:12:20.661 --> 01:12:22.122]  That's not true either.
[01:12:22.142 --> 01:12:24.004]  It's hundreds of companies, pure crap, all lies.
[01:12:26.185 --> 01:12:26.966]  It's delicious.
[01:12:30.308 --> 01:12:32.610]  And they surround it with a bunch of other food to make it look real.
[01:12:35.632 --> 01:12:37.033]  And they can engineer and do whatever they want.
[01:12:37.053 --> 01:12:40.015]  It's like Bill Gates releasing billions of mosquitoes in Brazil and Florida.
[01:12:40.255 --> 01:12:41.236]  Now there's all these new illnesses.
[01:12:42.697 --> 01:12:46.320]  These are total and complete absolute demonic maniacs.
[01:12:47.921 --> 01:12:51.443]  Netanyahu says Israel is a production of non-animal cow's milk.
[01:12:57.288 --> 01:12:59.089]  I guess for export here for us to eat, huh?
[01:13:02.491 --> 01:13:04.393]  This is going on all over the place.
[01:13:05.998 --> 01:13:07.658]  And it's extremely dangerous.
[01:13:08.379 --> 01:13:09.719]  But I say there's no regulations.
[01:13:09.739 --> 01:13:10.579]  Well, there is now.
[01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:16.101]  Two states have passed laws banning synthetic fake meat.
[01:13:16.921 --> 01:13:19.701]  It's a pharmacological drug.
[01:13:19.721 --> 01:13:20.922]  It's drug companies.
[01:13:22.282 --> 01:13:25.403]  Oh, we ban your, oh, we ban your regular meat.
[01:13:25.463 --> 01:13:27.203]  It bad, but this meat good.
[01:13:27.223 --> 01:13:28.864]  This meat you staking out.
[01:13:30.784 --> 01:13:31.925]  Then y'all eat delicious.
[01:13:32.785 --> 01:13:33.565]  It's so good.
[01:13:38.339 --> 01:13:39.600]  You're like, I'll never eat that.
[01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:40.020]  Oh yeah?
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:43.742]  Tyson Foods, one of the biggest meat producers in the world, announced last year.
[01:13:45.703 --> 01:13:51.187]  They've built giant ESG, BlackRock-funded facilities across the U.S.
[01:13:51.207 --> 01:13:56.109]  to now put in the breading of chicken and other things, and the breading on okra, all the stuff they make.
[01:13:58.131 --> 01:14:01.793]  Bug protein that's known to be super toxic and super carcinogenic.
[01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:03.290]  The chitin.
[01:14:03.790 --> 01:14:04.110]  Look up.
[01:14:04.350 --> 01:14:05.931]  Bug, protein, cancer.
[01:14:06.491 --> 01:14:07.331]  Chitin shells.
[01:14:07.391 --> 01:14:07.911]  Cancerous.
[01:14:08.871 --> 01:14:10.152]  Bug exoskeletons.
[01:14:11.212 --> 01:14:12.512]  Linked to massive cancer.
[01:14:13.993 --> 01:14:14.553]  Arthritis.
[01:14:16.073 --> 01:14:19.774]  There's a reason you look at a cockroach and don't want to eat it, because your brain knows that's bad.
[01:14:20.974 --> 01:14:25.335]  And moreover, people are noticing they try to get these cricket meal stuff and to get it to dogs and stuff, they won't eat it.
[01:14:25.936 --> 01:14:27.716]  Dog will eat anything that's food.
[01:14:28.576 --> 01:14:31.457]  Dog will eat crap out of the cat box if the cat's eating real food.
[01:14:33.068 --> 01:14:36.852]  A dog will eat SH-T, but it won't eat this stuff.
[01:14:37.673 --> 01:14:39.615]  It's nose is a thousand times on average.
[01:14:40.616 --> 01:14:41.917]  A bloodhound's a thousand, they say.
[01:14:41.937 --> 01:14:43.459]  A regular dog's a couple hundred times stronger.
[01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:45.601]  And they're like, woo, I'm not eating that!
[01:14:46.462 --> 01:14:48.644]  Pigs won't eat a lot of the GMO stuff they feed them.
[01:14:50.246 --> 01:14:52.248]  So, they know it's not food, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:52.268 --> 01:14:55.291]  These disgusting globalists are attacking us.
[01:14:56.693 --> 01:14:57.654]  At every level.
[01:14:57.694 --> 01:15:00.776]  This is just absolutely out of control.
[01:15:00.796 --> 01:15:02.618]  Now let's move into that big story I was telling you about.
[01:15:03.999 --> 01:15:09.804]  The government cartel paid billions to Walgreens and CBS not to fill Ivermectin.
[01:15:10.525 --> 01:15:11.686]  The question is why?
[01:15:11.706 --> 01:15:12.506]  Well you know why.
[01:15:13.007 --> 01:15:20.413]  They didn't want people to have the great effect and then they wanted to go out and take the poison shot which actually is a hundred times worse probably than the actual virus itself.
[01:15:20.613 --> 01:15:22.795]  Big, giant report on that.
[01:15:23.655 --> 01:15:28.258]  And now they've had to report it in their taxes, and it's all public information.
[01:15:28.298 --> 01:15:32.061]  Give me the poison shot, when you come and ask for Ivermectin, oh no, you're crazy.
[01:15:33.101 --> 01:15:37.624]  You know, and then when people start getting Budesonide, if they already had it really bad, oh sorry, we're not going to give you Budesonide.
[01:15:37.665 --> 01:15:38.725]  No, I don't care what your doctor said.
[01:15:38.745 --> 01:15:39.666]  Nope, just go die.
[01:15:39.986 --> 01:15:40.807]  Nope, ventilator time.
[01:15:41.927 --> 01:15:46.951]  Total weaponization, and it doesn't matter if you're in Australia, Germany, the U.S., Canada, everywhere they wouldn't give you Ivermectin.
[01:15:46.971 --> 01:15:48.272]  They paid them all over the world to do this.
[01:15:48.532 --> 01:15:49.813]  All orchestrated
[01:15:51.013 --> 01:15:51.754]  Organized crime.
[01:15:52.314 --> 01:16:02.624]  There's also a big story about this at Infowars.com, where we have written about it, and where we break it all down.
[01:16:02.684 --> 01:16:07.428]  I hope you will go to the site, and I hope you will get it, and I hope you will share the article.
[01:16:08.909 --> 01:16:09.169]  U.S.
[01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:16.956]  government cartel paid CBS Walgreens billions, b-b-b-b-b-billions to
[01:16:18.368 --> 01:16:21.752]  Reject Ivermectin prescriptions, push COVID shots.
[01:16:23.113 --> 01:16:30.922]  Social engineering writ large against you and your family.
[01:16:32.303 --> 01:16:34.726]  Now let's get into the new hype that's going on.
[01:16:37.310 --> 01:16:43.291]  What you can and can't eat amid America's bird flu outbreak, according to ex-FDA food chief.
[01:16:43.371 --> 01:16:46.912]  Avoid steak, salad, dressing, and even some favorite desserts.
[01:16:47.572 --> 01:16:48.893]  No one's gotten the bird flu.
[01:16:49.313 --> 01:16:53.294]  They're totally hyping it up, obviously getting a new version ready that does go to humans to be released.
[01:16:53.974 --> 01:16:58.815]  Probably right before the election, we're not sure, but they're certainly getting it up to full white-hot hype mode.
[01:17:00.086 --> 01:17:03.868]  And now, oh, steaks, chicken, everything, you can't eat anything, but bugs are safe!
[01:17:04.048 --> 01:17:04.588]  Bugs are safe!
[01:17:04.968 --> 01:17:12.471]  Again, you can't eat steak, it's bad for the earth, plus it's got bird flu, and you know, the Daily Mail, you can't eat it, you're gonna get bird flu.
[01:17:13.032 --> 01:17:18.914]  Now, the government comes out, ABC News, and says, well, bird flu outbreak poses no risk to the safety of America's food supply.
[01:17:19.234 --> 01:17:25.997]  But, here's NBC, bird flu's bad for poultry and cattle, but why it's not a dire threat for most of us yet.
[01:17:28.278 --> 01:17:29.279]  Oh, see how it works?
[01:17:31.087 --> 01:17:37.129]  And they're, it's all pre-programmed, it's all ready to be rolled out against the population.
[01:17:37.169 --> 01:17:44.852]  They know exactly what they're doing because they're organized criminals that set up their technocracy, set up their scam, and then move it against us.
[01:17:45.233 --> 01:17:46.233]  Now let's continue here.
[01:17:47.513 --> 01:17:50.535]  Big article up on InfoWars.com, so critical.
[01:17:51.415 --> 01:17:58.578]  On top of the thousands of studies and thousands of scientists and top cancer doctors already coming out.
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:00.961]  More scientists come out.
[01:18:01.421 --> 01:18:07.224]  Cancer researchers call a halt mRNA vaccines amid surge in turbo cancer directly linked to the shots.
[01:18:07.304 --> 01:18:11.326]  Remember the FDA document, October 2000, said it would cause all the things it's caused.
[01:18:11.606 --> 01:18:12.006]  They knew.
[01:18:12.446 --> 01:18:12.786]  They did it.
[01:18:12.846 --> 01:18:14.347]  It's a global health alert.
[01:18:14.767 --> 01:18:18.269]  Not from the bird flu, but from the shots they're giving you.
[01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:23.191]  You may think you already know about all this, but don't think others know.
[01:18:23.251 --> 01:18:24.932]  Get the article from InfoWars.com.
[01:18:25.933 --> 01:18:26.273]  Share it.
[01:18:26.813 --> 01:18:27.273]  Here's another one.
[01:18:27.974 --> 01:18:28.614]  I mentioned yesterday.
[01:18:32.731 --> 01:18:35.492]  UK government and NHS infected blood.
[01:18:35.512 --> 01:18:36.273]  This is a new article.
[01:18:37.773 --> 01:18:41.775]  They knew it had HIV and hepatitis in it and did it anyways and killed millions.
[01:18:45.056 --> 01:18:48.138]  And again, that's Bayer Pharmaceutical, the same ones that own Roundup.
[01:18:49.458 --> 01:18:54.641]  Glyphosate detected in human semen for the first time, four times higher in concentrations.
[01:18:54.981 --> 01:18:57.142]  French scientists tested
[01:18:58.243 --> 01:19:06.588]  128 men who were unable to have children but otherwise very healthy and found that their testicles have been eaten by glyphosate.
[01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.270]  Yep.
[01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:11.211]  Wonder why infertility is so high?
[01:19:11.552 --> 01:19:14.213]  They spray it on so many of the foods.
[01:19:15.554 --> 01:19:19.617]  The effect of glyphosate on human sperm mobility and sperm DNA fragmentation.
[01:19:19.857 --> 01:19:23.139]  Here's the PubMed study if you'd like to check it out.
[01:19:24.226 --> 01:19:24.806]  Here's another one.
[01:19:25.306 --> 01:19:29.107]  High levels of weed killer found in more than half of spurned sample study finds.
[01:19:29.447 --> 01:19:30.147]  London Guardian.
[01:19:34.048 --> 01:19:39.089]  UK professor that wanted deadly pathogens to cull population also praised NHS vaccine program.
[01:19:39.429 --> 01:19:40.509]  Don't forget that story.
[01:19:40.869 --> 01:19:41.789]  It all ties together.
[01:19:42.009 --> 01:19:50.210]  Oh, he wants to kill everybody and believes we should get rid of at least 8 million people, but he really wants you to take a shot and that you should be locked in your house because he wants you to live.
[01:19:51.331 --> 01:19:52.851]  What a nice person.
[01:19:54.414 --> 01:20:02.640]  Same people cutting off the coal, the gas plants, cutting off the gas pipelines, the gasoline pipelines, cutting off the fertilizer worldwide.
[01:20:04.501 --> 01:20:08.984]  They know exactly what they're doing, attacking civilization.
[01:20:09.004 --> 01:20:10.645]  You've got to realize you're under attack.
[01:20:11.146 --> 01:20:12.827]  You've got to understand you're under attack.
[01:20:13.127 --> 01:20:21.373]  You've got to deal with it and warn others and realize that once we're aware of it and don't follow their directives and whatever they say do, do the opposite.
[01:20:22.918 --> 01:20:26.700]  But if they get their cashless society and they get us under their control grid, we're in deep trouble.
[01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:29.402]  I see robots driving around all over Austin delivering things.
[01:20:30.002 --> 01:20:33.264]  Waterburgers now are shutting down and going all robot.
[01:20:33.684 --> 01:20:34.525]  McDonald's are.
[01:20:35.045 --> 01:20:37.146]  Never support any of that up front.
[01:20:37.186 --> 01:20:39.367]  And most of them are failing because people get it.
[01:20:39.407 --> 01:20:41.048]  Just like the Metaverse failed.
[01:20:41.228 --> 01:20:42.449]  24 billion invested by Zuckerberg.
[01:20:42.529 --> 01:20:46.872]  No one used it, basically, other than little kids they put it on because the parents are idiots.
[01:20:46.892 --> 01:20:47.952]  But it's still a tiny fraction.
[01:20:47.972 --> 01:20:50.954]  When you see parents doing it, warn them and tell them what's going on.
[01:20:52.898 --> 01:20:57.521]  All right, we're gonna go to break and come back with massive amounts of news on so many subjects.
[01:20:57.661 --> 01:21:12.492]  On the WEF, the latest on SWAB, why he really resigned, I've got intel on that, and mainstream admissions, the big UN power grab treaty, CBDC, headlines about CBDC set to fail, massive censorship developments.
[01:21:13.272 --> 01:21:17.455]  Oh my God, I've got a bunch of robot surgery news we're gonna definitely have to get to.
[01:21:18.856 --> 01:21:21.318]  There is so much coming up, but
[01:21:22.449 --> 01:21:25.990]  You heard the news, or at least you were tuned in 25, 30 minutes ago.
[01:21:26.970 --> 01:21:37.533]  Federal judge said, we're not going to let the left and the Democratic Party that's tried to use this court just to shut down InfoWars and Alex Jones, just shut it down.
[01:21:38.534 --> 01:21:46.276]  If you wanted to get some money that was there, but it still goes on as a company, you could have that, but you don't get to shut him down.
[01:21:47.168 --> 01:21:48.009]  At least in this court.
[01:21:48.529 --> 01:21:51.351]  Now, they'll kick it in the state court in a few months and they're going to come and try to shut it down.
[01:21:51.391 --> 01:21:52.091]  That's a whole other battle.
[01:21:52.451 --> 01:21:55.633]  But, he could have gone ahead and said, fine, liquidate it.
[01:21:55.653 --> 01:21:58.015]  He said, and they looked as white as ghosts, we're told.
[01:21:58.915 --> 01:22:01.837]  So, InfoWars is still in the fight.
[01:22:01.857 --> 01:22:03.018]  Thanks for your prayers and support.

[01:25:11.522 --> 01:25:15.705]  All right, my next guest is here for an hour and a half, and he always does a great job.
[01:25:15.866 --> 01:25:17.787]  People love him, I love him too, but listen to me.
[01:25:17.847 --> 01:25:24.733]  He's never sent me, in six, seven, eight months we've been, I've known about him for 25 years, World Net Daily, you name it.
[01:25:25.333 --> 01:25:34.441]  I have never, in all the interviews we've done, covered this much information, because the quickening's here, so much insanity's happening.
[01:25:34.881 --> 01:25:35.402]  He sent me
[01:25:36.741 --> 01:25:52.789]  Three big stacks, and some of this I was already going to be covering, and a lot of it I didn't even know about, of insanity happening right now in the world markets, the economy, and the big money running around, moving things around, telling the public one thing while they do another thing.
[01:25:53.009 --> 01:25:59.492]  So you see massive exits, not just Klaus Schwab, not just Melinda Gates, not just Peter Daszak,
[01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:02.731]  But not just Mitch McConnell.
[01:26:04.151 --> 01:26:09.393]  The rats are now stampeding to the exits off the edge of a cliff like Lemmings.
[01:26:11.174 --> 01:26:12.194]  What do they know is coming?
[01:26:12.475 --> 01:26:20.217]  Well, we know from mainstream media, they admit it, and about fights in the last year of the WF asking him to leave or step down.
[01:26:20.538 --> 01:26:21.478]  Klaus Schwab said no.
[01:26:21.518 --> 01:26:22.558]  I showed you the headline yesterday.
[01:26:23.098 --> 01:26:26.900]  But I've talked to my sources that are at the highest levels of this whole thing.
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:29.081]  I've told you this before, but they just confirmed.
[01:26:29.912 --> 01:26:30.332]  Yeah, no.
[01:26:30.372 --> 01:26:32.074]  I mean, I said, what's going on?
[01:26:32.094 --> 01:26:33.455]  They said, well, you know better than anybody.
[01:26:34.156 --> 01:26:35.276]  They're super unpopular.
[01:26:35.316 --> 01:26:36.257]  Bill Gates is hated.
[01:26:38.919 --> 01:26:39.660]  Biden's hated.
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:40.901]  Klaus Schwab's hated.
[01:26:41.081 --> 01:26:45.425]  All these front people are hated, so they think they can put new front people up and try to get their agenda through.
[01:26:45.845 --> 01:26:49.668]  Their world government, UN pandemic treaty's stalling.
[01:26:51.049 --> 01:26:54.812]  I got headlines, central bank digital currency's at risk of failure already.
[01:26:55.953 --> 01:26:57.755]  In China and other areas, they're being rolled out.
[01:26:59.053 --> 01:27:01.155]  Everything they're doing is turning to crap.
[01:27:01.395 --> 01:27:12.704]  They were supposed to destabilize things and bring their old bubble down and bring in a new bubble, but if the world's aware of them and aware of how they're the evil and how they're the bad guys, well, we have a great reset, but they all go to prison.
[01:27:13.965 --> 01:27:15.946]  They don't become even more powerful.
[01:27:17.808 --> 01:27:28.076]  So, Dr. Elliott sent me so much here that we're going to be going over, and we've got all
[01:27:29.355 --> 01:27:36.497]  Of these massive, massive, massive exits that are happening.
[01:27:37.918 --> 01:27:39.098]  Rats leaving sinking ship.
[01:27:39.138 --> 01:27:43.099]  JP Morgan, Jamie Dimon signals retirement is closer than ever.
[01:27:43.239 --> 01:27:45.200]  Davos Foreign Leader Klaus Schwab steps down.
[01:27:45.220 --> 01:27:48.801]  FDIC Chair Martin Bruttenberg to step down.
[01:27:50.157 --> 01:27:54.142]  As new bank rules loom, HSBC CEO announces surprise retirement.
[01:27:54.723 --> 01:27:56.025]  This is all just the last few days.
[01:27:56.385 --> 01:27:58.328]  And remember that clip we played last time Elliot was on?
[01:27:58.348 --> 01:28:02.854]  And we got so much here, I shouldn't play old clips, but the FDIC board meeting.
[01:28:04.855 --> 01:28:09.279]  Saying, well, we're going to have bailouts, we're going to take money out of people's bank accounts, but we can't tell them yet.
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:12.222]  And it's being recorded and put on the government website.
[01:28:13.083 --> 01:28:14.464]  So this isn't coming.
[01:28:14.564 --> 01:28:15.165]  This is here.
[01:28:15.245 --> 01:28:20.250]  As Dr. Elliott predicted six, eight months ago, regional bank closures, now they've begun again.
[01:28:21.491 --> 01:28:25.535]  So, Doc, I mean, we could talk for an hour and a half, just about five articles.
[01:28:25.975 --> 01:28:27.436]  You sent me like 40 or 50 of them.
[01:28:27.536 --> 01:28:28.257]  You sent me a whole
[01:28:31.064 --> 01:28:32.045]  List of videos.
[01:28:32.105 --> 01:28:37.489]  So you tell us where to go first here, and you tell us what videos you want, when you want to go to them.
[01:28:37.509 --> 01:28:39.930]  I'll try to give you the floor here as much as I can.
[01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:53.460]  I'll obviously love to chime in because everything you're saying is dead on, but I don't know what you call this moment, but I mean, they've been planning this collapse for a long time, and now once it's initiated, I don't think they can even stop it, even though it's not going the way they want it.
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:54.281]  I think that's fair to say.
[01:28:55.854 --> 01:28:57.175]  I think that's fair to say.
[01:28:57.295 --> 01:29:05.721]  You know, you and I were touching base this weekend when the Iranian president went down in the helicopter, right?
[01:29:06.321 --> 01:29:09.483]  And I started putting a bunch of things together.
[01:29:09.503 --> 01:29:14.446]  I'm just looking at weird stuff, Alex, that's been happening over the last couple of weeks.
[01:29:15.167 --> 01:29:17.388]  And people are dying.
[01:29:18.029 --> 01:29:19.350]  People are resigning.
[01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:23.152]  And to me, it's like, how do you explain it?
[01:29:23.172 --> 01:29:25.214]  It's like, I think something is
[01:29:25.914 --> 01:29:27.195]  Big is coming.
[01:29:27.515 --> 01:29:32.719]  Like literally, I just think something big is coming, because if we go back... By the way, let me interrupt you.
[01:29:32.759 --> 01:29:42.247]  I said I wouldn't, but I should add you're an economist, you're an economist, you're a researcher, you're an author, you've been well-known for 25 years, you made some of the most accurate predictions.
[01:29:42.267 --> 01:29:42.867]  Sorry, start over.
[01:29:44.388 --> 01:29:46.050]  No, so you look at
[01:29:47.170 --> 01:29:47.811]  What's coming?
[01:29:47.991 --> 01:29:50.933]  So, let's look at May 7th.
[01:29:51.434 --> 01:29:54.717]  There was an assassination attempt against Saudi Crown Prince.
[01:29:54.737 --> 01:29:57.960]  Okay, so May 13th.
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:04.085]  Turkish President Erdogan holds an emergency meeting following a warning of a possible military coup.
[01:30:04.145 --> 01:30:09.870]  May 15th, an assassination attempt on the Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fee.
[01:30:11.592 --> 01:30:16.837]  Let's see, May 16th, citizen arrested for threatening to assassinate Serbian President Vucic.
[01:30:17.378 --> 01:30:22.743]  May 19th, Saudi Arabia King Salman hospitalized for the second time in four weeks.
[01:30:23.544 --> 01:30:33.394]  So then you come to 19th, this weekend, when the helicopter went down with the Iranian president and their foreign minister and they died.
[01:30:33.914 --> 01:30:52.003]  Right, so to me, Alex, I'm a lot like you when a headline is just a headline, but you always have to look at what happened to cause the headline and what are the ramifications moving forward of what that headline said, right?
[01:30:52.063 --> 01:30:56.326]  So I'm looking at this helicopter crash with the Iranian president, it's like, ooh,
[01:30:57.026 --> 01:31:02.531]  A, this smells bad, and B, this is going to be create havoc all over the world.
[01:31:03.212 --> 01:31:19.906]  And sure enough, you know, a lot of the Iranian militant groups or whatever starts talking about, well, this helicopter crashed and, and the president was just in Azerbaijan meeting with these Zionist leaders there.
[01:31:19.926 --> 01:31:22.048]  It's like, okay, keyword, right?
[01:31:22.088 --> 01:31:23.690]  Because what are they thinking?
[01:31:24.170 --> 01:31:32.392]  They're thinking, Zionists, you know, the Jewish political elite, they're basically blaming the helicopter crash on Israel with that statement.
[01:31:32.412 --> 01:31:34.893]  It's like, they must have done it, right?
[01:31:34.913 --> 01:31:37.794]  He was coming back from a meeting with those Zionists, they must have done it.
[01:31:37.854 --> 01:31:44.075]  And then, there was more talking points after that of blaming America.
[01:31:44.095 --> 01:31:45.996]  It's like, okay, how could they blame America?
[01:31:46.576 --> 01:31:56.302]  Well, because Biden put economic sanctions on Iran and they couldn't get any parts, you know, replacement parts for their airplanes and for their helicopters.
[01:31:56.342 --> 01:32:04.427]  And so, therefore, the president of Iran had to fly in this helicopter that was old and doesn't have good parts, and that's why it crashed.
[01:32:05.327 --> 01:32:08.728]  You've got part of them blaming Israel.
[01:32:09.229 --> 01:32:12.090]  You've got part of them blaming the United States.
[01:32:12.490 --> 01:32:25.655]  Well, I put a couple of these statements together, and you've got these uneducated terrorist groups now who are basically coming across our open border, Alex.
[01:32:26.095 --> 01:32:30.917]  And we've got sleeper cells all over the country, and they're going to hear these talking points
[01:32:31.497 --> 01:32:38.839]  It's like man, so you look at that stuff and I think these kind of things will cause more and more unrest.
[01:32:38.939 --> 01:32:48.842]  But then you've got on the 20th, which you already referenced this one, Jamie Dimon announced that he's retiring as the CEO of Chase.
[01:32:49.870 --> 01:32:59.539]  May 20th, also, speculation, unverified, but speculation that Jerome Powell is resigning as Fed chair.
[01:33:00.279 --> 01:33:05.644]  And then it came out that the Trump administration said, oh, Trump's president, he's going to start, he's going to dump Powell.
[01:33:05.704 --> 01:33:07.066]  It's one of the first things that he does.
[01:33:07.606 --> 01:33:13.852]  And then May 21st, Klaus Schwab stepping down as the president of the World Economic Forum.
[01:33:14.392 --> 01:33:29.136]  And then those other two articles that you posted, HSBC, their CEO stepping down, and you've got all this stuff that's happening, and the FDIC leader stepping down.
[01:33:29.636 --> 01:33:36.318]  And Dr. Elliott, I want you to continue, but I just want to add something here that is so central for everybody to understand.
[01:33:37.583 --> 01:33:42.525]  Right before 2008, in that big crisis, there were a bunch of stepping down like this.
[01:33:42.605 --> 01:33:43.406]  This is even bigger.
[01:33:43.846 --> 01:33:50.409]  And right before COVID, in November and December of 2019, record.
[01:33:50.789 --> 01:33:52.150]  In fact, bigger than this so far.
[01:33:52.170 --> 01:33:52.950]  I'm sure more is coming.
[01:33:53.670 --> 01:33:55.611]  CEOs stepping down or resigning.
[01:33:56.332 --> 01:33:58.033]  You're an economist, respected guy.
[01:33:58.293 --> 01:33:59.113]  You're super smart.
[01:33:59.133 --> 01:34:00.534]  You know more than I do in many cases.
[01:34:01.595 --> 01:34:07.227]  I know you don't like to speculate, but in the past, why did they step down right before these events happened?
[01:34:07.247 --> 01:34:08.249]  Because they want to get their money.
[01:34:08.590 --> 01:34:09.471]  They don't want to be blamed.
[01:34:09.491 --> 01:34:10.013]  I mean, what is it?
[01:34:12.122 --> 01:34:21.064]  Well, they want to make sure that they don't actually get the blame and because they want to leave with their golden parachute right before things collapse.
[01:34:21.084 --> 01:34:23.864]  I mean, I would say part of it is ego.
[01:34:24.164 --> 01:34:26.144]  They don't want to get blamed for what they cause.
[01:34:26.164 --> 01:34:27.265]  So they just step aside.
[01:34:27.325 --> 01:34:30.865]  And it's always the person holding the bag gets blamed at the time.
[01:34:31.245 --> 01:34:35.486]  But they also get to walk away with their money, you know, before everything falls apart.
[01:34:35.986 --> 01:34:40.407]  So I'm I'm looking at some of these some of these big dogs like Jamie Dimon.
[01:34:41.267 --> 01:34:49.203]  I mean, those three kind of strike it weird to me.
[01:34:49.463 --> 01:34:52.649]  I mean, if Jamie Dimon and Klaus Schwab alone, it would be huge.
[01:34:53.570 --> 01:34:54.331]  It would be huge.
[01:34:54.391 --> 01:34:55.192]  It would be massive.
[01:34:55.212 --> 01:35:02.982]  And it's like, Alex, we are so close to their dream for decades coming to fruition.
[01:35:03.563 --> 01:35:10.972]  If we were that close and you put all this stuff together and that was your baby, why wouldn't you stay to see that dream fulfilled?
[01:35:11.843 --> 01:35:13.123]  I mean, why leave now?
[01:35:13.704 --> 01:35:16.565]  So, my brain is going into overload.
[01:35:16.965 --> 01:35:23.607]  It's like, I think that something so big and so bad is coming that they don't want to be blamed for it.
[01:35:23.907 --> 01:35:27.208]  And maybe that's a good thing that's coming.
[01:35:27.748 --> 01:35:34.731]  Maybe they know that Trump is going to come in and clean house and expose all this nonsense and the rats are jumping off the ship first.
[01:35:35.351 --> 01:35:50.390]  Or maybe they know what the economic collapse and mayhem that's going to come from like central bank digital currency having access to everybody's bank accounts and the unraveling that that's going to cause and they don't want to be part of it.
[01:35:50.410 --> 01:35:53.794]  Yes, they want that to happen, but they don't want to take the blame for it.
[01:35:53.814 --> 01:35:54.475]  No, exactly.
[01:35:54.535 --> 01:35:58.198]  It's like, you know, once the war starts, the General's on the front line, but he pulls back.
[01:35:58.538 --> 01:36:00.760]  They now want to try to sink off of the shadows.
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:04.263]  I think that's clearly what's happening with most of them, because we've seen this pattern before.
[01:36:04.563 --> 01:36:07.226]  With Schwab or Melinda Gates, it's different.
[01:36:07.266 --> 01:36:12.230]  Her resigning last week from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that's carrying out the Admitted Worldwide Depopulation Program.
[01:36:12.250 --> 01:36:18.015]  They give each other awards, by the way, we've played their own banquets where they give each other awards for Human Depopulation Foundation.
[01:36:18.035 --> 01:36:21.418]  That's its real name, Global Depopulation Foundation.
[01:36:22.592 --> 01:36:30.299]  They're doing it because they've become such horrible leaders that are so hated that even though they're arrogant, they've hit the panic button.
[01:36:30.619 --> 01:36:36.284]  But other than them, we're seeing this mass exodus because big stuff's already started.
[01:36:38.402 --> 01:36:40.244]  Really big stuff has already started.
[01:36:40.304 --> 01:36:48.912]  And so two of the big things that the two people on there, HSBC and JP Morgan Chase.
[01:36:49.573 --> 01:36:52.375]  So you look at what do they do?
[01:36:52.455 --> 01:36:54.837]  What are they the biggest banks in the world of?
[01:36:55.558 --> 01:37:02.085]  Those two are number one and number two largest short sellers of silver on the planet.
[01:37:02.486 --> 01:37:03.247]  Those two banks.
[01:37:03.787 --> 01:37:08.473]  And now we're starting to see a short squeeze happening in silver.
[01:37:09.073 --> 01:37:09.233]  Right.
[01:37:09.273 --> 01:37:11.916]  And so you look at it and where we are today.
[01:37:12.677 --> 01:37:24.827]  Or actually, as of Friday, I haven't seen the numbers of this week, but we had 568 million ounces of silver being shorted, naked shorts, meaning they don't own the assets.
[01:37:25.207 --> 01:37:30.231]  They just put these futures contracts on them to shorts to drive the price down.
[01:37:30.652 --> 01:37:38.058]  Well, when you have a short position and the value of the underlying thing that you're shorting goes up,
[01:37:38.898 --> 01:37:44.704]  Alex, you lose money hand over fist, in multiples, not dollar for dollar, but multiples.
[01:37:45.345 --> 01:37:55.636]  So here's where we talked about the last time that we were on the show together, how the day before Iran basically sent those drones into Israel,
[01:37:58.106 --> 01:38:13.463]  China made this announcement, said, hey, everybody in China, start buying silver, don't just buy gold, buy silver, because they knew that at that time you have all these hundreds of millions of ounces.
[01:38:13.483 --> 01:38:18.268]  You made the point that China was trying to call the naked shorts of the Western Central Banks.
[01:38:19.269 --> 01:38:27.535]  Yes, I did, and I think that's what's happening because look at what's happened to silver since that time.
[01:38:28.296 --> 01:38:30.557]  Skyrocketing, going through the roof.
[01:38:30.677 --> 01:38:33.460]  To me, that's a function of supply and demand.
[01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:37.743]  You've got low supply, you've got high demand, you've got a short squeeze starting,
[01:38:38.303 --> 01:38:53.500]  Where the manufacturers of the world, the defense contractors, the aerospace industry, the fuel cell technology people, the solar people, they all need silver and there's not much available because China, you know, they have 1.4 billion people.
[01:38:53.860 --> 01:38:57.724]  I don't know how many of them are buying silver, but they made the announcement that you should do it.
[01:38:58.405 --> 01:39:04.569]  Well, Alex, there's 800 million ounces of silver mined in a year, globally.
[01:39:05.070 --> 01:39:11.874]  And they've got 1.4 billion people, even if half of them, half of their population just bought one ounce, right?
[01:39:11.894 --> 01:39:14.396]  Well, you basically take up all of the global supply.
[01:39:14.616 --> 01:39:22.181]  They don't have to do that much because India has already committed to 66% of the world's supply this year.
[01:39:22.261 --> 01:39:24.943]  So here's where we've got this short squeeze happening.
[01:39:25.103 --> 01:39:27.925]  Physical supply coming out of inventory.
[01:39:28.385 --> 01:39:31.589]  Not available for the manufacturers to purchase.
[01:39:32.190 --> 01:39:37.396]  And what has happened to the price of silver in the last two and a half months?
[01:39:38.157 --> 01:39:45.045]  Literally, the last 75 days or so, silver's gone from 22 and a half to almost 32.
[01:39:46.767 --> 01:40:01.255]  Alex, it's up like 45% in two and a half months, and you've got those Western banks that have millions, hundreds of millions of ounces of silver short, and the price went up 45%.
[01:40:01.756 --> 01:40:03.737]  They are losing money hand over fist.
[01:40:04.137 --> 01:40:06.999]  So part of me says this kind of
[01:40:07.819 --> 01:40:19.150]  Being on the wrong side of a price move when it's leveraged could cause HSBC and JPMorgan Chase to have a really, really, really big financial problem.
[01:40:19.471 --> 01:40:22.234]  And their CEOs are jumping ship.
[01:40:22.794 --> 01:40:23.955]  They're getting out of Dodge.
[01:40:24.977 --> 01:40:28.021]  Well, I think it's clear that that's what's happening.
[01:40:28.061 --> 01:40:29.543]  Will the Chinese be successful?
[01:40:29.603 --> 01:40:31.966]  And if so, what does this do to the markets?
[01:40:32.347 --> 01:40:33.729]  I mean, not just obviously silver and gold.
[01:40:34.089 --> 01:40:37.915]  Something like this is going to be like a giant torpedo.
[01:40:37.995 --> 01:40:39.337]  So how do you see that unfolding?
[01:40:40.424 --> 01:40:46.831]  Well, those two banks, HSBC and JPMorgan Chase, aren't the only banks and hedge funds that are shorting silver.
[01:40:47.612 --> 01:40:56.702]  You know, so when the price goes up and it's gone up so rapidly, you're going to see kind of the contagion spread across the financial markets.
[01:40:57.143 --> 01:41:01.447]  But here's where inflationary pressures are going to be extreme.
[01:41:02.308 --> 01:41:04.969]  And the budgetary constraints are going to be extreme.
[01:41:05.009 --> 01:41:12.712]  So, inflationary pressures, because manufacturers need silver for just about everything that we buy in electronics.
[01:41:13.052 --> 01:41:26.136]  Well, if the price of silver has gone up 46% in the last two and a half months, what's that ultimately going to mean for prices, retail prices, when we're buying stuff, when we're buying electronics?
[01:41:26.156 --> 01:41:27.317]  Well, it's going to go through the roof.
[01:41:27.937 --> 01:41:30.058]  What about the federal budget?
[01:41:31.107 --> 01:41:43.434]  Right, so we've got our federal budget, the defense spending that we have, when they need 11,000 ounces of silver in these big missiles and these big torpedoes that they're shooting off, that they're gone.
[01:41:43.555 --> 01:41:45.636]  When they're done, when they're shooting them off, they're gone.
[01:41:45.676 --> 01:41:48.578]  You're not reclaiming any of that because it blew to smithereens.
[01:41:49.338 --> 01:41:53.302]  They have to replace it with silver that's now 46% higher than it was.
[01:41:54.403 --> 01:42:00.950]  In a government that's budgetary constrained... And to explain that, it's a strategic metal, so that's part of the excuse to keep it low.
[01:42:01.290 --> 01:42:02.772]  The other reason is to hide inflation.
[01:42:04.694 --> 01:42:06.876]  When they're unable to do that, it sends more shockwaves.
[01:42:08.106 --> 01:42:14.629]  More budgetary shockwaves, and now they're already constrained at the government level.
[01:42:14.649 --> 01:42:17.431]  They don't have enough money coming in to pay the expenditures.
[01:42:18.171 --> 01:42:27.776]  So we're going to see a budget meltdown, I think, and we're going to see inflationary pressures continue to ensue.
[01:42:28.636 --> 01:42:48.455]  But you look at the budget numbers that just came out, and our debt levels, Alex, are so extreme that the interest-only payments on our debt for fiscal year, the fiscal year is done later this year, around October, we're already at $517,000.
[01:42:51.593 --> 01:42:54.656]  Let's see, billion in interest only payments.
[01:42:54.896 --> 01:42:56.598]  That's our debt payment so far.
[01:42:57.198 --> 01:43:01.723]  We're on pace for a trillion dollars of interest payments this year.
[01:43:02.383 --> 01:43:05.266]  Now that surpasses Medicare.
[01:43:05.726 --> 01:43:10.090]  That surpasses the Defense Department.
[01:43:10.110 --> 01:43:11.271]  It's like, what?
[01:43:12.279 --> 01:43:12.799]  Defense?
[01:43:12.839 --> 01:43:14.100]  We're in a wartime economy.
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:15.581]  We're spending a lot on defense.
[01:43:15.621 --> 01:43:20.043]  And we just spent more money than the entire Marine Corps budget.
[01:43:20.063 --> 01:43:21.163]  62 billion to Ukraine.
[01:43:21.943 --> 01:43:24.405]  But Doc, is it the big elephant in the room?
[01:43:24.925 --> 01:43:26.806]  Or the trillion pound behemoth?
[01:43:27.679 --> 01:43:32.606]  The issue of inflation with Tyson Foods and all of them saying, you're going to create riots.
[01:43:32.986 --> 01:43:34.188]  People can't buy food.
[01:43:34.669 --> 01:43:38.714]  A bunch of major food producers said, we're seeing people unable to buy basic staples.
[01:43:39.796 --> 01:43:42.880]  So major producers are going to the government and say, you got to do something.
[01:43:44.158 --> 01:43:47.381]  Yeah, everybody's saying the government has to do something.
[01:43:47.841 --> 01:43:54.746]  See, if you're the government, and now you've got everybody coming to you saying, you've got to fix something, you've got to fix something.
[01:43:55.287 --> 01:44:01.492]  If I were an evil politician, I'd be thinking, sweet, I've got everybody where I want them.
[01:44:01.912 --> 01:44:06.997]  Because now I can give them a whole line of crap and they're going to want it because they're already asking for it.
[01:44:07.118 --> 01:44:08.899]  I just give them the solution that I want.
[01:44:08.919 --> 01:44:12.603]  Which is the Central Bank Digital Currency and the Unified Ledger.
[01:44:13.264 --> 01:44:14.065]  You always come on.
[01:44:14.105 --> 01:44:15.086]  You're an amazing guy.
[01:44:15.747 --> 01:44:16.548]  And I have you as a guest.
[01:44:16.728 --> 01:44:17.248]  People love you.
[01:44:17.268 --> 01:44:18.770]  But you need to plug.
[01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:19.731]  You're also a sponsor.
[01:44:19.751 --> 01:44:20.532]  You keep us on air.
[01:44:20.612 --> 01:44:21.253]  You don't brag.
[01:44:21.293 --> 01:44:22.073]  You don't toot your horn.
[01:44:23.584 --> 01:44:32.491]  You're one of the biggest gold and silver sellers, if not the biggest, in the country, and you're super respected, and you have the best prices on gold and silver bullion.
[01:44:32.511 --> 01:44:37.975]  A lot of people claim they're selling bullion, but they still sell it for 10, 20, 30 percent above what it is.
[01:44:38.155 --> 01:44:38.836]  You don't do that.
[01:44:38.876 --> 01:44:41.318]  You have a one-time purchasing fee that's free.
[01:44:41.958 --> 01:44:42.318]  We're good.
[01:44:59.732 --> 01:45:01.213]  We're good to go.
[01:45:17.799 --> 01:45:19.261]  You're saying mainly silver right now.
[01:45:19.301 --> 01:45:19.961]  You explain that.
[01:45:20.021 --> 01:45:23.005]  Spend a few minutes before we go to break and hit all this other news.
[01:45:23.045 --> 01:45:24.887]  You haven't even really gotten all the stuff you sent me.
[01:45:25.207 --> 01:45:25.767]  It's insane.
[01:45:25.787 --> 01:45:27.669]  These clips, these articles, these angles.
[01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:31.613]  But give us a pitch for gold and silver because I only promote what I know is right.
[01:45:31.633 --> 01:45:35.638]  I haven't had a gold or silver sponsor for 10 years, not because I didn't have...
[01:45:36.809 --> 01:45:38.430]  Literally a hundred offers or more.
[01:45:38.831 --> 01:45:40.512]  We took a few, did one week test.
[01:45:40.833 --> 01:45:44.136]  They swore they'd sell, you know, silver and gold bullion.
[01:45:44.196 --> 01:45:45.217]  They would not do it.
[01:45:45.897 --> 01:45:49.861]  And I would call and check and I would say, sorry, here's your check back.
[01:45:50.421 --> 01:45:51.542]  How dare you do that?
[01:45:51.962 --> 01:45:53.444]  All I get is great reviews from you.
[01:45:53.484 --> 01:45:55.145]  My family personally uses you.
[01:45:55.546 --> 01:45:58.969]  Tell us how they can call Kirk Elliott Precious Metals right now.
[01:46:00.236 --> 01:46:00.436]  Yeah.
[01:46:00.616 --> 01:46:00.877]  Okay.
[01:46:01.237 --> 01:46:03.739]  So first, but after the break, you got to come back.
[01:46:03.799 --> 01:46:06.702]  The videos that we're going to watch today, the video clips are insane.
[01:46:06.862 --> 01:46:07.883]  They are so wild.
[01:46:07.923 --> 01:46:08.744]  You got to watch them.
[01:46:08.784 --> 01:46:16.452]  But, but here's where we've already talked about how silver is up 46% in the last two and a half months.
[01:46:17.848 --> 01:46:28.684]  And if you go into high-grade, semi-rare, semi-numismatic, collectible-type junk that most of the dealers sell, you know what?
[01:46:28.884 --> 01:46:31.969]  You still wouldn't be at a break-even point, Alex.
[01:46:33.050 --> 01:46:35.072]  So, our firm is just different.
[01:46:35.472 --> 01:46:39.435]  We charge 8% when you purchase, 0% when you liquidate.
[01:46:39.775 --> 01:46:51.324]  We buy directly from the depository in Shiner, Texas, the Texas Precious Metals Depository, and so their wholesale prices, you tack on 8%, they ship it directly to you.
[01:46:51.764 --> 01:46:54.707]  When you sell it back, we take nothing
[01:46:55.407 --> 01:46:55.887]  Zero.
[01:46:56.368 --> 01:46:58.989]  And whatever the depository prices are, you get all of it.
[01:46:59.429 --> 01:47:14.876]  See, that's a huge difference from buying a rare coin, something that has a high commission, high premium, where even after the big move in silver that we've seen, you still haven't even broken even on that stuff with some of that jump.
[01:47:15.796 --> 01:47:16.616]  I do call it junk.
[01:47:16.876 --> 01:47:18.877]  Not all silver is good silver.
[01:47:19.077 --> 01:47:20.537]  Not all gold is good gold.
[01:47:21.958 --> 01:47:33.501]  We only do cheap, low cost per ounce bullion because I want you to take advantage of these trends and maximize your growth by minimizing your cost per ounce.
[01:47:33.941 --> 01:47:35.381]  The only way to do that is with bullion.
[01:47:35.421 --> 01:47:37.302]  Now, we can do it in an IRA.
[01:47:38.542 --> 01:47:43.904]  Or we can do it outside of an IRA, where you set up your own personal storage account, you take delivery of it at home.
[01:47:44.404 --> 01:47:50.527]  But a lot of people have, Alex, because of Biden's economy, a lot of people don't have money right now.
[01:47:50.567 --> 01:47:52.628]  It's just sitting around in their bank accounts, right?
[01:47:52.668 --> 01:47:57.250]  So most of people's wealth is tied up in their retirement accounts.
[01:47:57.910 --> 01:48:04.957]  And this is where a typical advisor would say, well, I can do silver for you, Mr. Klein or Mrs. Klein, but it's going to be an ETF.
[01:48:04.997 --> 01:48:06.138]  It's like, no, that's paper.
[01:48:06.658 --> 01:48:18.389]  You're only as strong as the underlying issue, whoever your brokerage house is, because if SIPC goes belly up or you have more than that limit, you lose all of it.
[01:48:18.869 --> 01:48:27.737]  Like when Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns went under, anybody that had over, you know, today's limit, $500,000 in their accounts, vanished, gone, it's done.
[01:48:28.278 --> 01:48:36.185]  See, when you have a tangible asset, physical gold, physical silver, it's not tied to a brokerage company.
[01:48:36.946 --> 01:48:43.270]  And the way that we charge 8% when you purchase, 0% when you liquidate, that is a huge deal.
[01:48:43.290 --> 01:48:44.190]  Well, absolutely.
[01:48:44.550 --> 01:48:46.952]  You're the only major person in the industry that does that.
[01:48:47.092 --> 01:48:48.313]  You're the place to get it, folks.
[01:48:49.221 --> 01:48:49.621]  All right.
[01:49:19.361 --> 01:49:21.664]  We'll take some brain force and then we'll do this commercial.
[01:49:21.684 --> 01:49:22.024]  How about that?
[01:49:33.528 --> 01:49:34.969]  Mmm, I can think again.
[01:49:35.349 --> 01:49:41.611]  This is the liquid tincture version of Brain Force, which means you can really tailor it to exactly what you need.
[01:49:41.891 --> 01:49:55.236]  I tend to take maybe a little bit more than is directed, but it's incredibly powerful stuff, and I have an incredibly demanding job, but you make it easy by going to InfoWarsStore.com, and of course, InfoWarsStore.com makes it easy by supplying me with Brain Force Ultra.
[01:49:55.316 --> 01:50:00.878]  I rely on this product to do my job on a daily basis because it's absolutely jam-packed with incredible ingredients.

[01:50:22.445 --> 01:50:24.366]  Now on sale at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:50:24.406 --> 01:50:26.847]  Brain Force Ultra is now on sale at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:50:28.982 --> 01:50:31.783]  It's more important than ever to keep independent, true media on air.
[01:50:32.223 --> 01:50:33.983]  And when you buy the products, that's what you're doing.
[01:50:34.863 --> 01:50:37.664]  And at least for the foreseeable future, we're still here.
[01:50:38.184 --> 01:50:39.404]  If things change, I'll let you know.
[01:50:39.444 --> 01:50:44.525]  But it's essential you buy products at InfoWarsTore.com because it funds the operation.
[01:50:44.545 --> 01:50:45.545]  But that's a side issue.
[01:50:45.885 --> 01:50:46.946]  They really are amazing.
[01:50:48.286 --> 01:50:49.346]  And I didn't know this.
[01:50:49.526 --> 01:50:50.166]  Somebody told me.
[01:50:50.766 --> 01:50:53.127]  Nitric Boost, I've been plugging for months, has been sold out.
[01:50:53.647 --> 01:50:54.307]  Best seller.
[01:50:55.147 --> 01:50:55.868]  Cleans out your blood.
[01:50:55.928 --> 01:50:57.128]  Cleans out your cardiovascular system.
[01:50:57.148 --> 01:50:57.888]  Does incredible things.
[01:50:59.261 --> 01:51:01.342]  Dr. Mikovits has talked about how it's one of the best formulas out there.
[01:51:01.362 --> 01:51:03.804]  Everybody should be on it, young and old, black and white.
[01:51:04.544 --> 01:51:05.805]  It is back in stock.
[01:51:05.845 --> 01:51:10.688]  Got a big shipment of it in at InfoWarStore.com for 40% off.
[01:51:11.789 --> 01:51:15.612]  So if I've been plugging it and you go there and it's not there, I apologize.
[01:51:15.692 --> 01:51:18.573]  I need to, I guess, get more briefings on what's in stock and what's not.
[01:51:19.194 --> 01:51:24.397]  But it's now back in stock at InfoWarStore.com or call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[01:51:29.227 --> 01:51:31.368]  All right, we are loaded with information.
[01:51:31.428 --> 01:51:35.029]  We have to move quick because I want to get to everything he sent me and it's going to be hard, but we're going to move quick.
[01:51:35.490 --> 01:51:39.311]  Some stations don't carry this first five, but next time we'll kick into all of it.
[01:51:39.331 --> 01:51:40.792]  Dr. Kirk Elliott finishing up.
[01:51:42.077 --> 01:51:44.419]  Because again, I know the gold and silver business.
[01:51:44.539 --> 01:51:52.567]  I've had sponsors been involved in it with great folks who are no longer in the business going back about 20, 70, 28 years.
[01:51:53.247 --> 01:51:54.949]  And there's just not that many good companies.
[01:51:55.029 --> 01:51:58.892]  It's great to be in gold and silver personally, but there's not a lot of great big companies.
[01:51:58.912 --> 01:52:02.696]  There's folks that know how to go pick gold and silver here and there, good deals on it.
[01:52:03.256 --> 01:52:05.178]  But as a one-stop shop, you guys are the place.
[01:52:05.198 --> 01:52:07.960]  But you got caught up on the break explaining to people
[01:52:08.641 --> 01:52:14.150]  That almost no one of any real size says, no fee in selling it back.
[01:52:14.731 --> 01:52:16.954]  And then you've got all these other services, so explain that.
[01:52:18.902 --> 01:52:22.043]  Yeah, so we deal directly with the depositor.
[01:52:22.083 --> 01:52:23.984]  We don't carry an inventory.
[01:52:24.464 --> 01:52:31.647]  That way, it goes right to the source, you know, right to the basically wholesaler, which is the depository.
[01:52:32.187 --> 01:52:39.250]  So when you purchase, we just take whatever their wholesale price is, we tack on 8%, it's shipped off to them, right?
[01:52:39.610 --> 01:52:43.512]  Or if it's in an IRA, it goes into storage because it's in your IRA.
[01:52:43.912 --> 01:52:46.293]  And then when you liquidate, you ship it back.
[01:52:46.573 --> 01:52:55.820]  To the depository, if you have it at home, or it's a simple, quick phone call or keystrokes, and we lock it in like seconds, and then we wire you the funds.
[01:52:56.121 --> 01:52:59.423]  Because we are not selling out of our own inventory.
[01:52:59.443 --> 01:53:01.985]  See, Alex, this is an important thing.
[01:53:02.326 --> 01:53:11.373]  When companies sell out of an inventory, they expect to, oh, they can have this big spread between buying and selling, and they can amplify their profits.
[01:53:11.953 --> 01:53:13.755]  But when they're on the wrong side,
[01:53:14.975 --> 01:53:21.978]  Of the trade, meaning they bought in a bunch of silver from a client, let's say, and then the next day silver goes down 50 cents.
[01:53:22.098 --> 01:53:23.739]  It's like, well, what are we going to do now?
[01:53:24.379 --> 01:53:26.460]  If we sell it at these prices, we're going to lose money.
[01:53:26.820 --> 01:53:34.483]  So they start to play this game of artificially having higher prices, higher spreads, higher commissions.
[01:53:35.083 --> 01:53:37.224]  This is the kind of game when I started
[01:53:38.488 --> 01:53:41.273]  Decades ago, never wanted to play that game.
[01:53:41.594 --> 01:53:42.716]  Just make it simple.
[01:53:43.036 --> 01:53:44.118]  Don't carry an inventory.
[01:53:44.459 --> 01:53:46.262]  Deal directly with the depository.
[01:53:47.119 --> 01:54:05.005]  Because, A, you can validate and verify that the gold and silver that you're getting isn't counterfeit, that it's real, that it's legitimate, and then you don't have this extra fluff that a lot of dealers might be kind of telling a story about to try to get rid of something that they're on the wrong side of.
[01:54:05.465 --> 01:54:08.646]  So we just make it really easy, really simple.
[01:54:09.127 --> 01:54:12.368]  In fact, my team, when you want to roll over an IRA,
[01:54:13.248 --> 01:54:24.956]  They'll find out what your needs are, where your funds are, what your dreams, your goals, your desires, and we'll craft a strategy, fill out a 15-minute form and an application to start a new IRA.
[01:54:24.976 --> 01:54:26.137]  It's an e-sign document.
[01:54:26.577 --> 01:54:28.018]  Then we handle the transfer.
[01:54:28.259 --> 01:54:29.760]  We call you when the funds come in.
[01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:33.182]  Get your authorization because it's not our money, it's yours.
[01:54:33.602 --> 01:54:36.825]  You know, but we'll help you aim the gun to be on target.
[01:54:37.125 --> 01:54:38.386]  You always pull the trigger.
[01:54:38.766 --> 01:54:42.689]  And this is where we operate with you as a team, as a partner.
[01:54:43.229 --> 01:54:50.494]  Moving forward to make sure that you're in the right place at the right time the majority of the time and to be clear understand every single thing about it.
[01:54:50.894 --> 01:54:56.138]  And you buy all these big respected high-quality depositories, but you also know all the good little depositories around the country.
[01:54:56.338 --> 01:54:58.019]  There's a bunch of them in Austin's and one of the best.
[01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:00.541]  Anyways, the point is is that
[01:55:01.141 --> 01:55:05.666]  You get delivered there so it's safe it's there and then you go there if you want to bury it in your backyard or whatever.
[01:55:06.026 --> 01:55:11.711]  You go or leave some at the depository and you take the rest home or you give it to family or you put it in a safe deposit box.
[01:55:11.952 --> 01:55:14.234]  The point is now it's not being delivered to your front door.
[01:55:14.574 --> 01:55:16.276]  Now it's not on a FedEx truck being robbed.
[01:55:17.867 --> 01:55:19.048]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:55:19.068 --> 01:55:23.549]  I mean, here's a strategy, like a splitting of the strategy.
[01:55:23.930 --> 01:55:25.030]  Take a little bit at home.
[01:55:25.270 --> 01:55:33.033]  So if the wheels fall off, merchants don't want our currency anymore, and you need something small for barter, well, you'll have some.
[01:55:33.433 --> 01:55:38.636]  But the lion's share should be stored at the depository where it's ultimately safe.
[01:55:39.316 --> 01:55:43.998]  The depository we use in Shiner, Texas, the Texas Precious Metals Depository,
[01:55:44.938 --> 01:55:48.181]  Unlimited insurance coverage on that through Lloyds of London.
[01:55:48.221 --> 01:55:53.226]  So there's, I don't know, 30, 40, 50 insurance companies, you know, carrying that insurance.
[01:55:53.786 --> 01:55:54.827]  But it's in Texas.
[01:55:54.887 --> 01:56:05.197]  Texas has very favorable legislation towards precious metals, where I can't say the same for California, New York, New Jersey, some of these other states, right, that just kind of might buckle.
[01:56:06.218 --> 01:56:09.140]  You've done all the legwork, all the thinking, you've got the best plan.
[01:56:09.721 --> 01:56:10.442]  People should check it out.
[01:56:11.062 --> 01:56:17.493]  You know, there's an excellent meme that says it all that I just reposted on my ex-account at Real Alex Jones for radio listeners to go check it out.
[01:56:17.513 --> 01:56:20.958]  But for TV viewers, I'm going to show it to you and I hope you go to Real Alex Jones and share it.
[01:56:21.539 --> 01:56:23.503]  And we'll actually put it HD on screen for TV viewers.
[01:56:24.258 --> 01:56:39.028]  And it shows Trump at his inauguration in 2021, what it looks like when you win an election, and then below it when Pelosi surrounded the Capitol with thousands of troops and barbed wire fences with Constantino wire, what it looks like when you steal an election.
[01:56:39.088 --> 01:56:40.589]  That says it all.
[01:56:40.669 --> 01:56:49.075]  Going back to Dr. Kirk Elliott here with us, a great economist, also a theologian, really smart guy, KEPM.com forward slash goal.
[01:56:50.421 --> 01:56:51.882]  He's also a great sponsor of ours.
[01:56:52.022 --> 01:56:55.406]  You've sent us a lot of intel, a lot of data, a lot of key clips.
[01:56:55.806 --> 01:57:03.713]  We're going to be going over here, dealing with the digital IDs already been passed in Australia, the WEF 15-Minute Cities, and what that really means.
[01:57:03.753 --> 01:57:05.175]  Let's start launching into this.
[01:57:07.523 --> 01:57:09.904]  Yeah, let's watch this first one on Australia.
[01:57:10.224 --> 01:57:14.365]  This is going to be the beginning of what I think is an ugly trend.
[01:57:14.885 --> 01:57:16.205]  Now, 15-minute cities.
[01:57:16.906 --> 01:57:18.486]  First, let's say, what are they?
[01:57:19.166 --> 01:57:30.609]  Right, so before we start watching these videos, well, it's this globalist World Economic Forum plan to have cities where you can walk or bike anywhere in 15 to 20 minutes.
[01:57:31.149 --> 01:57:32.050]  What is that goal?
[01:57:32.250 --> 01:57:36.291]  To get rid of carbon emissions, to have no cars, so you're going to have all these
[01:57:37.231 --> 01:57:43.539]  Millennials and Gen Xers and all Gen Zs and all these college kids thinking, this is utopia!
[01:57:43.579 --> 01:57:44.560]  This is amazing!
[01:57:44.981 --> 01:57:47.504]  Look, we can walk everywhere and it's going to be so cool!
[01:57:48.405 --> 01:57:53.270]  Not so much, because wait till you see some of these videos and what comes next.
[01:57:53.731 --> 01:58:05.323]  So they want to corral everybody, Alex, and then how are they going to basically do the investigation on whether you're complying or not?
[01:58:05.543 --> 01:58:07.645]  That's where central bank digital currencies come in.
[01:58:07.926 --> 01:58:10.869]  So let's watch this first video from Australia.
[01:58:12.651 --> 01:58:23.017]  Third reading, the bill for an act to provide for the accreditation of entities in relation to digital IDs and to establish the Australian Government digital ID system and for related purposes.
[01:58:36.158 --> 01:58:48.140]  I have to report that the Digital ID Transitional and Consequential Provisions Bill 2023 has been fully considered by the Federation Chamber and has been agreed to without amendment.
[01:58:48.200 --> 01:58:50.941]  I present a certified copy of the bill.
[01:58:51.541 --> 01:58:54.801]  The question is that the bill be agreed to.
[01:58:54.821 --> 01:58:55.541]  I'll put the question.
[01:58:55.921 --> 01:58:58.442]  Those opinion say aye against no.
[01:58:59.633 --> 01:59:00.394]  I think the ayes have it.
[01:59:01.575 --> 01:59:01.956]  No's have it.
[01:59:02.136 --> 01:59:02.957]  Division required?
[01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:06.861]  No division required.
[01:59:06.941 --> 01:59:08.984]  This bill has been agreed to.
[01:59:10.165 --> 01:59:13.869]  No consideration, no actual vote.
[01:59:13.929 --> 01:59:16.813]  They just had the committee decide to ram it through.
[01:59:16.833 --> 01:59:19.336]  So that's the total WF Global's agenda.
[01:59:20.919 --> 01:59:25.044]  Well, and so that's how easy our freedoms can erode.
[01:59:26.366 --> 01:59:29.931]  In one minute, we just saw what happened in Australia.
[01:59:29.951 --> 01:59:36.580]  You know, I saw this meme yesterday and it's like, what does the future of prison look like?
[01:59:36.900 --> 01:59:41.223]  And it was a space, you know, satellite view of Australia, the continent.
[01:59:41.283 --> 01:59:42.323]  It was like, that was it.
[01:59:42.704 --> 01:59:50.369]  That's what prison is going to look like, just Australia, where now digital ID, what is going to be part of those digital IDs?
[01:59:50.389 --> 02:00:04.577]  And I know, Alex, you've talked about this a bunch in the past, but your health records, your passports, your driver's license, your bank accounts, your preferences, everything that you spend money on, it's all there.
[02:00:05.598 --> 02:00:07.818]  It's all there, right?
[02:00:07.858 --> 02:00:10.699]  And so, they just passed this digital ID thing.
[02:00:10.959 --> 02:00:17.280]  Now, to me, that is the beginning of digitizing everything in your life.
[02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:33.304]  Now, the United Nations is meeting in September of this year to basically expose their UN Pact for the Future agenda, which is everything that they've been working on since about 2019.
[02:00:35.711 --> 02:00:35.871]  What?
[02:00:35.971 --> 02:00:38.415]  No, that's not on there.
[02:00:39.096 --> 02:00:40.558]  Hey, Doc, I apologize.
[02:00:40.598 --> 02:00:41.960]  I'm sitting here listening to you.
[02:00:42.761 --> 02:00:47.467]  I had the mic live and I was about to call Robin here and ask him for another video clip.
[02:00:47.507 --> 02:00:47.928]  I forgot.
[02:00:48.048 --> 02:00:48.208]  Sorry.
[02:00:48.228 --> 02:00:48.469]  Go ahead.
[02:00:50.164 --> 02:00:50.525]  No worries.
[02:00:50.925 --> 02:01:01.590]  So, you know, back to 2019, when a lot of this Executive Order 14067 started, where Biden said, hey, we're going to have central bank digital currency in America.
[02:01:01.990 --> 02:01:05.932]  Then you have all the other things that you and I have talked about on previous shows.
[02:01:06.012 --> 02:01:09.074]  And if people want to go back and look, they should watch those things.
[02:01:09.554 --> 02:01:14.637]  The Bank for International Settlements, Project Icebreaker, Project Aurora, Unified Ledgers,
[02:01:16.037 --> 02:01:17.698]  You know, programmable money.
[02:01:17.838 --> 02:01:19.258]  This is what this is all about.
[02:01:19.658 --> 02:01:25.480]  So to me, if you have a digital ID, you have to have a digital currency.
[02:01:26.240 --> 02:01:28.261]  That's what comes next, right?
[02:01:28.281 --> 02:01:34.303]  Because that digital ID that's going to be you, it's basically your financial DNA.
[02:01:35.163 --> 02:01:37.244]  It's your kind of political DNA.
[02:01:37.344 --> 02:01:44.347]  It's everything that you are is now going to be part of this big brother world where they know everything.
[02:01:44.867 --> 02:01:47.748]  And with the flip of a switch, they can cut you off.
[02:01:48.068 --> 02:01:49.609]  So this just happened in Australia.
[02:01:49.849 --> 02:01:50.309]  You know what?
[02:01:50.409 --> 02:01:52.991]  Note to self, it's coming here next.
[02:01:53.471 --> 02:01:53.771]  Why?
[02:01:53.851 --> 02:01:59.113]  Because we've got other video clips talking about some ridiculous things.
[02:01:59.533 --> 02:02:02.995]  So let's look at video number
[02:02:03.875 --> 02:02:05.796]  You want to go to the next clip?
[02:02:05.836 --> 02:02:06.696]  No, no, go ahead and talk about it.
[02:02:06.716 --> 02:02:08.297]  That's the 15-minute cities.
[02:02:08.317 --> 02:02:09.477]  That's clip three.
[02:02:34.068 --> 02:02:34.848]  What are they doing?
[02:02:34.889 --> 02:02:41.132]  They've got their first 15-minute city basically up and running and deployed, and here's what they're doing.
[02:02:41.612 --> 02:02:45.314]  And you'll see on the video when we watch it, 11 districts.
[02:02:45.354 --> 02:02:49.317]  So they've separated this 15-minute city into 11 districts.
[02:02:50.097 --> 02:02:54.398]  Now, to be able to leave the districts, you need to get a permit.
[02:02:54.418 --> 02:02:55.698]  It's like, what?
[02:02:55.718 --> 02:02:58.319]  Is this the Hunger Games?
[02:02:59.279 --> 02:03:01.240]  I mean, I'm not joking.
[02:03:01.600 --> 02:03:12.983]  You're walking around, you think this is convenient, you've got all your amenities, your gas station, or not gas stations, there's gonna be no gas, grocery stores, convenience stores, shopping offices, everything within 15 minutes.
[02:03:13.963 --> 02:03:18.846]  And then you need a permit to leave your district that you're assigned to.
[02:03:18.866 --> 02:03:31.174]  Alex, this sounds like the Gestapo, when they would put into different sections, you know, the Polish Jews and everything else, and Nazi Germany.
[02:03:31.194 --> 02:03:33.276]  It's like, this sounds just like that!
[02:03:34.176 --> 02:03:40.319]  And yet, they're viewing this as some kind of an amazing utopia to help fight carbon emissions.
[02:03:41.119 --> 02:03:42.619]  It's not about that at all.
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:45.361]  This is about complete people control.
[02:03:47.982 --> 02:03:49.362]  And let's go ahead and roll now.
[02:03:49.502 --> 02:03:50.803]  Let's go ahead and play clip three.
[02:03:50.863 --> 02:03:53.144]  This is WUF 15-Minute Cities.
[02:03:53.384 --> 02:03:53.724]  Here it is.
[02:03:55.236 --> 02:03:58.519]  This brand new rental community in Tempe has all the amenities.
[02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:03.184]  Fitness center, dog park, outdoor kitchens, but something's missing.
[02:04:03.745 --> 02:04:06.067]  So, there are no cars in this community at all.
[02:04:06.427 --> 02:04:06.828]  Isn't it great?
[02:04:07.489 --> 02:04:09.891]  Cul-de-sac is the first community in the U.S.
[02:04:09.971 --> 02:04:13.294]  designed and built specifically for car-free living.
[02:04:13.754 --> 02:04:17.097]  Co-founder Ryan Johnson says the demand is strong.
[02:04:17.397 --> 02:04:22.041]  Every generation, including 90% of Gen Z, would like to pay more to live in a walkable neighborhood.
[02:04:22.361 --> 02:04:27.786]  Retail, restaurants, and to start nearly 200 apartments all within steps of each other.
[02:04:28.206 --> 02:04:31.429]  No cars means no parking spaces, no garages.
[02:04:32.029 --> 02:04:36.972]  Because we don't have residential parking, it opens us up to have 55% landscape space.
[02:04:36.992 --> 02:04:38.873]  We get to add so much to the neighborhood.
[02:04:39.254 --> 02:04:41.475]  Like social spaces around every corner.
[02:04:42.396 --> 02:04:46.778]  The complex is strategically located right next to the area's light rail system.
[02:04:47.159 --> 02:04:48.700]  All residents get a free pass.
[02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:52.222]  The first 200 also get a free electric e-bike.
[02:04:53.484 --> 02:05:22.492]  Now, Dr. Elliott, I played a clip before you got here, and you were probably busy, but in the first, or start of the second hour, I played a clip of Israel with Netanyahu, and they're going, yeah, you know, we're going to ban beef and ban everything that's bad for the earth, but we've got this lab-grown meat and lab-grown fish that's literally cloned cells that go through all these dirty tubes, and then we're going to spray it out and make you eat it with no regulation, no control, and then we've got Bloomberg famously saying he wants to ban red meat and ban salt,
[02:05:23.052 --> 02:05:23.613]  We're good to go.
[02:05:35.933 --> 02:05:39.175]  This is total and complete big brother to ban everything.
[02:05:39.195 --> 02:05:42.117]  The Netherlands wants to ban 70% of the farms by 2030.
[02:05:42.177 --> 02:05:44.418]  They already banned 30% of them.
[02:05:44.638 --> 02:05:45.419]  Ireland's banning them.
[02:05:45.679 --> 02:05:50.422]  Sri Lanka's at a total overthrow of the government because eight years ago they started the project.
[02:05:50.482 --> 02:05:51.582]  Everybody's starving to death.
[02:05:51.903 --> 02:05:53.344]  They're cutting off the fertilizer.
[02:05:53.384 --> 02:05:56.866]  They're killing the real infrastructure while they create inflation.
[02:05:57.606 --> 02:06:05.764]  So, government and these private corporations, these globalists are acting like this is all out of control and they don't know what to do, but they're the ones engineering it.
[02:06:05.965 --> 02:06:08.290]  Can you speak to that before we play this clip of Eric Adams?
[02:06:09.389 --> 02:06:15.212]  Well, yeah, so that, I mean, meat done in a lab in dirty tubes?
[02:06:15.232 --> 02:06:16.532]  That sounds disgusting.
[02:06:16.912 --> 02:06:20.394]  But that's the new world that they want us to live in, right?
[02:06:20.454 --> 02:06:25.336]  So, because cows are so dirty and toxic to the environment, right?
[02:06:25.376 --> 02:06:31.699]  They emit gases and that hurts the greenhouse effect and all this other nonsense, right?
[02:06:32.179 --> 02:06:33.940]  They want us to eat bugs and like it.
[02:06:34.580 --> 02:06:39.464]  Right, so when Netanyahu is doing that in Israel, the same thing is happening here.
[02:06:39.824 --> 02:06:43.547]  This isn't just a European thing or a Middle Eastern thing.
[02:06:43.988 --> 02:06:45.129]  This is happening here.
[02:06:45.189 --> 02:06:51.454]  Now, when you look at those rules, people aren't going to comply 100% of the time.
[02:06:51.934 --> 02:06:59.380]  You know, this is just like the Old Testament, when you had Deuteronomy and Numbers and rule after rule after rule after rule.
[02:06:59.601 --> 02:07:00.702]  People break them!
[02:07:00.922 --> 02:07:02.063]  It's human nature!
[02:07:02.623 --> 02:07:02.843]  Right?
[02:07:03.263 --> 02:07:06.044]  But which is why in the New Testament you have Jesus.
[02:07:06.104 --> 02:07:09.245]  It's full of mercy, full of grace, and it covers all of that stuff.
[02:07:09.265 --> 02:07:18.167]  It's like living in this massive rules-based society becomes extremely hard when the rules are coming from the government and not from God.
[02:07:18.487 --> 02:07:18.967]  Right?
[02:07:19.367 --> 02:07:24.668]  So you look at this and people will not be 100% compliant all the time.
[02:07:25.068 --> 02:07:28.149]  And that's where how do they get the data?
[02:07:28.689 --> 02:07:32.010]  How are they going to be able to tell if you're not compliant?
[02:07:32.651 --> 02:07:35.345]  By what you spend your money on, right?
[02:07:35.385 --> 02:07:36.651]  So you've got your digital ID.
[02:07:37.515 --> 02:07:38.796]  That's going to be tracking you.
[02:07:38.896 --> 02:07:43.919]  Miller put it in your your forehand or forehead or wrist or wherever they're going to put it, right?
[02:07:44.519 --> 02:07:51.804]  So you've got that that's going to track you, but you've got your money, your bank account, which is going to tell you what you're spending your money on.
[02:07:52.164 --> 02:07:58.307]  So if you leave the district, if you leave that cul-de-sac community, they're going to know everything about you.
[02:07:58.648 --> 02:08:00.529]  Well, what are the what are the regulations?
[02:08:00.569 --> 02:08:02.870]  What are the ramifications that are going to come next?
[02:08:03.450 --> 02:08:05.832]  See, Alex, when they control your money,
[02:08:06.946 --> 02:08:15.313]  When they control what you buy and sell based on your digital social profile and social credit score, this is how they're going to penalize you.
[02:08:15.973 --> 02:08:17.434]  They don't have to put you in jail.
[02:08:17.895 --> 02:08:20.577]  They just flip the switch and say you can't spend any more.
[02:08:21.317 --> 02:08:22.618]  You can't spend any more on this stuff.
[02:08:23.279 --> 02:08:26.822]  And look, I know most our audience gets that, but the point is it's here.
[02:08:27.082 --> 02:08:28.543]  It ain't coming, people.
[02:08:28.743 --> 02:08:29.043]  I know.
[02:08:30.024 --> 02:08:30.625]  I know you know.
[02:08:30.705 --> 02:08:32.186]  It's pissing me off.
[02:08:35.215 --> 02:08:35.796]  It's right here.
[02:08:37.339 --> 02:08:45.011]  The mayor of New York just gave a speech about how they're going to start monitoring everybody who eats beef.
[02:08:47.631 --> 02:08:47.831]  What?
[02:08:48.191 --> 02:08:51.853]  I mean, there's a little video clip- I mean, this is just fantastical level tyranny!
[02:08:51.873 --> 02:08:53.113]  These people are a joke!
[02:08:53.334 --> 02:08:54.814]  They need to all be in prison!
[02:08:55.034 --> 02:08:57.735]  They just injected us with all this poison garbage, Doc!
[02:08:57.775 --> 02:09:05.219]  I know I've never ran to it when you're on the air with me, but... I mean, this is just outrageous level nanny state tyranny, and it's all designed to make us eat bugs!
[02:09:05.959 --> 02:09:19.127]  Yeah, let's play the clip of the horrible, evil, race-baiting, demonic mayor, who acts like he's against the open borders, but tells the illegal aliens to come there, and then gets all the money, and then when people, like, shoot cops, they let him out of jail.
[02:09:19.167 --> 02:09:20.588]  I mean, it's just crazy!
[02:09:21.108 --> 02:09:22.289]  These are the bad guys!
[02:09:22.329 --> 02:09:23.489]  These are the disruptors!
[02:09:23.850 --> 02:09:24.770]  These are the enemies!
[02:09:25.130 --> 02:09:27.352]  Here he is, he's gonna track meat-eaters!
[02:09:28.152 --> 02:09:29.974]  You know, they made the Jews wear yellow stars.
[02:09:29.994 --> 02:09:30.354]  You know that?
[02:09:30.574 --> 02:09:31.355]  Well, that was wrong.
[02:09:31.375 --> 02:09:31.855]  It was terrible.
[02:09:32.075 --> 02:09:36.599]  This is going on to American meat eaters because it'll take down the whole economy.
[02:09:37.020 --> 02:09:39.121]  They want to feed us their literal crap.
[02:09:39.201 --> 02:09:39.702]  Here it is.
[02:09:40.543 --> 02:09:50.571]  Food is the third biggest source of cities emissions right after builders and transportation.
[02:09:50.831 --> 02:09:52.493]  But all food is not created equal.
[02:09:53.806 --> 02:10:00.092]  The vast majority of food that is contributing to our emission crisis
[02:10:01.545 --> 02:10:04.687]  Lies in meat and dairy products.
[02:10:05.648 --> 02:10:07.149]  And I got the full articles right here.
[02:10:07.209 --> 02:10:09.831]  He goes on to say they're going to track it now.
[02:10:10.551 --> 02:10:12.152]  So, in fact, guys, pull the article up.
[02:10:12.192 --> 02:10:12.833]  Just type it in.
[02:10:13.513 --> 02:10:16.555]  New York City mayor proposes tracking what meat you eat.
[02:10:16.915 --> 02:10:18.456]  Again, that's the social credit score.
[02:10:18.737 --> 02:10:19.877]  That's on the debit card.
[02:10:19.917 --> 02:10:21.498]  That's on the new QR code.
[02:10:21.819 --> 02:10:23.240]  That's the central ledger.
[02:10:23.660 --> 02:10:29.424]  Eric Adams vows to reduce New York City's food-based emissions at agencies
[02:10:29.904 --> 02:10:30.044]  By 33%.
[02:10:30.184 --> 02:10:34.627]  I mean, they're literally going to track and tell you what to eat.
[02:10:34.707 --> 02:10:35.428]  My God!
[02:10:35.888 --> 02:10:40.731]  These people... I mean, prisoners in a frickin' prison have more freedom over their diet.
[02:10:41.431 --> 02:10:42.172]  If they have their way.
[02:10:43.527 --> 02:10:44.768]  Well, they do.
[02:10:44.868 --> 02:10:48.711]  See, this is all coming together, Alex, and we can see it.
[02:10:48.791 --> 02:10:50.412]  And we're putting the pieces together.
[02:10:51.112 --> 02:10:57.517]  You have the enforcement arm of these stupid politicians saying, if you do this, well, you're going to get in trouble.
[02:10:57.537 --> 02:10:58.558]  We'll cut you off from your money.
[02:10:58.578 --> 02:10:59.358]  You're going to go to jail.
[02:10:59.939 --> 02:11:02.561]  You've got the corralling of people.
[02:11:03.461 --> 02:11:07.745]  In these 15-minute cities, where you can't leave without a permit.
[02:11:08.405 --> 02:11:11.167]  So much for freedom of choice of anything.
[02:11:11.187 --> 02:11:12.008]  Right?
[02:11:12.048 --> 02:11:12.508]  Good grief.
[02:11:12.908 --> 02:11:18.813]  And then you've got the investigatory arms, which is truly now your bank account.
[02:11:18.833 --> 02:11:20.074]  It's like, what in the world?
[02:11:20.694 --> 02:11:24.357]  How can you say that your bank account is the investigatory arm?
[02:11:24.837 --> 02:11:26.318]  Because it's now digital.
[02:11:26.679 --> 02:11:28.540]  And because you can track with it.
[02:11:29.101 --> 02:11:31.923]  And so this is where all these pieces are coming together.
[02:11:32.543 --> 02:11:49.792]  Right here, right now, right underneath our nose, and yet, hmm, you've got people that put all this stuff together, like Klaus Schwab, and like Jamie Dimon, and like the CEOs of these other places that are all jumping ship right before this happens.
[02:11:49.812 --> 02:11:51.973]  It's like, Alex, do they know?
[02:11:52.853 --> 02:11:59.936]  That this is going to absolutely be a colossal cluster of a rollout, like Obamacare was.
[02:12:00.916 --> 02:12:04.277]  And there's going to be riots and protesting and looting and people are going to revolt.
[02:12:04.757 --> 02:12:08.479]  And they're going to look at the people who put it together and say, we're blaming you.
[02:12:09.219 --> 02:12:14.281]  Where if they get out of Dodge, they got all this stuff put together and now they don't get the blame for it.
[02:12:14.361 --> 02:12:16.602]  That's what I think why these people are leaving.
[02:12:16.882 --> 02:12:17.542]  Well, expand.
[02:12:17.602 --> 02:12:18.722]  I don't think you're right.
[02:12:18.762 --> 02:12:19.303]  I know you're right.
[02:12:19.323 --> 02:12:20.263]  So expanding on that.
[02:12:22.468 --> 02:12:27.871]  If you pull back and look at this, they don't just track what you do with this.
[02:12:27.991 --> 02:12:31.354]  Again, they're able to say you can't have meat right now.
[02:12:31.414 --> 02:12:32.875]  You've already gone past your allotment.
[02:12:32.895 --> 02:12:33.595]  And how do I know that?
[02:12:33.635 --> 02:12:36.737]  That's proposed by the environmentalists, anti-humans.
[02:12:36.957 --> 02:12:38.738]  That's proposed by the UN, the WF.
[02:12:39.039 --> 02:12:44.742]  That is in 12-year-old cartoons funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and the UN that
[02:12:45.703 --> 02:12:52.027]  Play to elementary school children in Canada and the UK called Plannedopolis.
[02:12:52.047 --> 02:12:57.149]  And it's a whole series and they say computers and robots run your whole life.
[02:12:57.390 --> 02:12:58.890]  You only get meat on your birthday.
[02:12:59.111 --> 02:13:01.552]  You only travel out of your city once a year.
[02:13:02.112 --> 02:13:03.333]  You live in these controlled cities.
[02:13:03.353 --> 02:13:05.754]  You have to get permission to go anywhere.
[02:13:05.874 --> 02:13:07.415]  Everything is self-driving cars.
[02:13:07.835 --> 02:13:10.097]  This is their damn plan, people!
[02:13:10.877 --> 02:13:14.322]  It's in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, made in 2007.
[02:13:14.723 --> 02:13:17.767]  That's what's so frustrating.
[02:13:17.787 --> 02:13:21.432]  People keep thinking I'm Nostradamus and I had a vision about this.
[02:13:22.113 --> 02:13:24.836]  And I have had, you know, revelations from God.
[02:13:24.856 --> 02:13:25.938]  I think we all do at some level.
[02:13:26.198 --> 02:13:38.311]  But 99% of this is their own admissions, where the UN World Food Council decides how many calories you get, and drones watch everything you do, and your house is full of cameras.
[02:13:38.471 --> 02:13:38.991]  Well guess what?
[02:13:39.051 --> 02:13:42.635]  All new cars have cameras, by law, and tracker and kill switches.
[02:13:43.116 --> 02:13:45.158]  And cars for 15 years have been putting them in.
[02:13:45.538 --> 02:13:47.220]  It's not coming, it's here.
[02:13:50.342 --> 02:13:53.284]  I mean, there's no refuting it.
[02:13:53.525 --> 02:14:01.671]  I mean, this is the problem, and this is why I want to help bring these solutions of, how do you escape a digital world?
[02:14:01.931 --> 02:14:04.753]  I mean, and- By the way, there it is, back it up.
[02:14:04.833 --> 02:14:06.855]  Calorie Car, for Radiolutions, I'm putting it on screen.
[02:14:07.215 --> 02:14:09.057]  Oh, look, you've got a calorie ration.
[02:14:11.761 --> 02:14:12.702]  I mean, seriously.
[02:14:12.722 --> 02:14:24.350]  In this world, this global utopia, you're not going to have everybody equally wealthy, you're going to have everybody equally poor, and you're going to have everybody equally dependent on the government.
[02:14:24.810 --> 02:14:29.353]  See, this is why I actually think they're letting the banks fail.
[02:14:30.194 --> 02:14:30.374]  Right?
[02:14:30.454 --> 02:14:31.795]  I think they're letting banks fail.
[02:14:31.835 --> 02:14:48.148]  So if you remove private capital and the ability for you and I to get a loan for a house or to get a home equity line or to get what a personal loan of anything, if the banks have run out of money, people will just do an end run around them and go directly to the government.
[02:14:48.188 --> 02:14:49.309]  Say, hey, we need this.
[02:14:49.349 --> 02:14:49.889]  We need that.
[02:14:50.530 --> 02:14:52.151]  And then what's the government's nature?
[02:14:52.171 --> 02:14:53.011]  It's like, OK.
[02:14:53.872 --> 02:14:56.434]  We'll give you all of this stuff, you just have to vote for us.
[02:14:56.534 --> 02:15:06.963]  And by the way, what you're saying is total nationalization, but it's fascism because a handful of select corporations will then make the money, they'll all be above the law, that is the admitted part.
[02:15:07.003 --> 02:15:08.364]  In fact, back this up ten seconds.
[02:15:08.824 --> 02:15:15.570]  This is the clip from the particular episode of Plantopolis, where you go, oh, you don't get meat, it's not your birthday.
[02:15:15.810 --> 02:15:21.074]  So the little kid's looking at the meat case, and they go, sorry, you only get meat once a year.
[02:15:21.495 --> 02:15:23.036]  Listen to this, here it is.
[02:15:25.142 --> 02:15:27.964]  Well, it won't be long until the little darlings get their career announcements.
[02:15:28.405 --> 02:15:31.887]  They've been working so hard, so I'm sure they'll get something good.
[02:15:32.407 --> 02:15:36.390]  Not that there's anything wrong with fixing carbon scrubbers for a living or anything.
[02:15:36.750 --> 02:15:37.410]  Are you hungry?
[02:15:38.491 --> 02:15:40.052]  Let's pop to the market as we're passing.
[02:15:41.333 --> 02:15:43.774]  Right, what's on the menu this month?
[02:15:44.535 --> 02:15:45.816]  No, not meat.
[02:15:45.896 --> 02:15:46.997]  It's not your birthday.
[02:15:48.157 --> 02:15:52.882]  The Global Food Council are doing a really good job of keeping food production going.
[02:15:53.462 --> 02:15:57.206]  I mean, you don't get the choice you used to, but we're better off than most.
[02:15:57.226 --> 02:16:01.631]  I think it's probably easiest to walk from here.
[02:16:02.251 --> 02:16:05.574]  You barely see a car in the city centre nowadays, unless you're rich.
[02:16:07.335 --> 02:16:09.656]  Well, the state knows they just aren't practical anymore.
[02:16:09.836 --> 02:16:11.917]  We're all trying to meet our global carbon deal.
[02:16:12.838 --> 02:16:15.979]  Electric bikes are so much better for getting around our neighborhood.
[02:16:16.279 --> 02:16:20.281]  And why waste valuable space on car parks when you can use them to grow food?
[02:16:20.941 --> 02:16:21.602]  Now, let's hit pause.
[02:16:21.642 --> 02:16:24.543]  This is 12 years ago where they acted like, oh, you'll grow food.
[02:16:24.603 --> 02:16:24.843]  No.
[02:16:25.263 --> 02:16:33.867]  You'll get bacteria-cloned meat cells sprayed out of a robot when you even get meat, which isn't meat.
[02:16:33.887 --> 02:16:35.428]  Dr. Elliott, this is pissing me off.
[02:16:36.755 --> 02:16:40.556]  Well, okay, so I've never seen that before, but here's where I'm looking at it.
[02:16:40.596 --> 02:16:46.198]  Twelve years ago, what were the talking points that that stupid cartoon lady said?
[02:16:46.839 --> 02:16:48.719]  Only the rich people have cars.
[02:16:49.180 --> 02:16:53.221]  See, already they're starting the divide, right?
[02:16:53.261 --> 02:16:58.183]  They're starting this division process of the haves versus the have-nots.
[02:16:58.823 --> 02:17:01.425]  They talked about, it's not your birthday, you don't get meat today.
[02:17:01.705 --> 02:17:07.650]  The Global Food Council, or whatever she said, has actually done a really good job about doing this.
[02:17:07.670 --> 02:17:12.533]  Well, this goes into the depopulation that they want for the whole world.
[02:17:12.913 --> 02:17:16.176]  There's not enough food to handle all the people.
[02:17:16.616 --> 02:17:21.240]  So rather than figuring out how to grow more food, they figure, oh, let's just get rid of people.
[02:17:22.438 --> 02:17:28.981]  I mean, everything that she said in there has been in this plan, in this agenda that you've exposed a long time ago.
[02:17:29.921 --> 02:17:31.902]  It's all happening right now.
[02:17:32.562 --> 02:17:44.307]  And now we've got vaccines and we've got avian flu and how it's transmitting from birds to humans and this and cows and this has never been, boy, what is this bad disease actually?
[02:17:44.327 --> 02:17:45.107]  This is really bad.
[02:17:45.548 --> 02:17:51.130]  And so they're preconditioning us to get into stupid vaccines, which may go into the population
[02:17:51.710 --> 02:17:55.575]  ...reduction plan that they had in that video from 12 years ago!
[02:17:56.196 --> 02:18:00.482]  That again is made by the UN with the Rockefeller Foundation.
[02:18:01.203 --> 02:18:03.185]  Go watch it folks, at the end it says who funds it.
[02:18:04.102 --> 02:18:05.623]  I mean, these people, and now it's here!
[02:18:06.284 --> 02:18:12.448]  In the clip from Israel, they go, you're not gonna get beef or fish anymore, we're gonna give it to you from cloned fish and cloned meat.
[02:18:12.508 --> 02:18:13.929]  It's not even a fully cloned fish.
[02:18:14.229 --> 02:18:16.410]  Okay, it's a copy of a fish, you know, a clone, whatever.
[02:18:16.751 --> 02:18:28.819]  No, it's cells they make in vats, where it's just, you get 10,000 cells of the same fish, a blob, made by these crazy people, and God knows what they're gonna put in it!
[02:18:29.019 --> 02:18:30.440]  We know what they're gonna put in it!
[02:18:30.740 --> 02:18:32.021]  Burn in hell, globalists!
[02:18:32.041 --> 02:18:33.642]  We'll never accept your tyranny!
[02:18:34.043 --> 02:18:35.149]  NEVER!
[02:18:36.035 --> 02:18:37.362]  Any boffins die.
[02:18:40.176 --> 02:18:44.438]  You can see here the Great Awakening orbiting the Great Reset.
[02:18:45.139 --> 02:18:54.884]  Although the depopulation systems of the Great Reset are not yet fully operational, the Great Reset does have a strong conspiracy network.
[02:18:55.344 --> 02:19:01.227]  It is protected by a satanic shield, which can be disabled by the Great Awakening.
[02:19:01.627 --> 02:19:07.831]  The Great Reset must be deactivated if any victory for humanity is to be accomplished.
[02:19:08.886 --> 02:19:22.920]  Once the Great Awakening deactivates the shield, InfoWars.com forward slash show will cover the truth while Info Warriors fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the Great Reset.
[02:19:23.420 --> 02:19:27.164]  Alex Jones has volunteered to lead the fighter attack.
[02:19:27.504 --> 02:19:32.929]  Get a signed copy of the Great Awakening today at InfoWarsStore.com!
[02:19:35.868 --> 02:19:39.092]  At a very instinctive level, I really want these people off our backs.
[02:19:39.112 --> 02:19:40.254]  They're such villains.
[02:19:40.274 --> 02:19:53.030]  I mean, if you knew down the street from your house, the little old lady that you've seen and talked to and helped carry groceries in, was tied up being gang-raped, you would grab your gun, you wouldn't even probably call the cops, you'd go down there and you'd kill their ass.
[02:19:53.956 --> 02:19:58.920]  Well, we can't just go do that with the globalists because they've got, like, shark teeth, row after row of replacements.
[02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:10.929]  We've got to kill their ideas, we've got to expose them, we've got to remove our support from them, we've got to get control of our governments, and then we're not going to imprison and execute these people once they've had due process because we hate them!
[02:20:11.607 --> 02:20:16.190]  We're gonna do it because we love the good people of this planet, and we're not gonna take it anymore.
[02:20:16.250 --> 02:20:26.216]  But when you see unbridled, psychotic evil by the technocrats and the big corporations unleashed on people, folks, if you're not pissed off, something's wrong with you.
[02:20:27.096 --> 02:20:32.560]  And, you know, the old Alex Jones, been on air 30 years, would blow up once a week on air, and it was never fake.
[02:20:32.600 --> 02:20:33.480]  People could tell it wasn't.
[02:20:35.241 --> 02:20:39.384]  And I've really learned to not let myself get angry and try to be
[02:20:40.916 --> 02:20:42.757]  What do the Buddhists call it, or the Zen Buddhists?
[02:20:44.138 --> 02:20:45.459]  It's not separated from it.
[02:20:45.539 --> 02:20:47.120]  It's, oh, there's a term I'm looking for.
[02:20:48.360 --> 02:20:49.021]  I'm not a Buddhist.
[02:20:49.061 --> 02:20:52.042]  I've just read the philosophy and it's, you know, detached.
[02:20:52.623 --> 02:20:55.364]  You're still against something, but you're detached from it.
[02:20:56.305 --> 02:20:57.546]  You're not emotional about it.
[02:20:57.586 --> 02:21:03.309]  Well, that's a good coping strategy if you're a trauma surgeon or you're somebody on the battlefield.
[02:21:04.249 --> 02:21:08.492]  But at the end of the day, folks, the best sports players, anybody, have emotion.
[02:21:09.484 --> 02:21:11.646]  And the best artists have emotion.
[02:21:11.746 --> 02:21:13.767]  And I'm just telling you, I'm really sick of these people.
[02:21:14.168 --> 02:21:19.992]  I've got four children, and I care about humanity, and I like good, decent, wholesome fun.
[02:21:20.332 --> 02:21:24.035]  And man, the people we got running things aren't just evil pedophile jerks.
[02:21:24.375 --> 02:21:26.637]  They really want us eating poison bugs.
[02:21:27.077 --> 02:21:30.558]  They want to take away everything decent, a nice juicy steak.
[02:21:30.938 --> 02:21:32.738]  They want to take away a nice piece of fish.
[02:21:32.999 --> 02:21:36.740]  They told people during the fake pandemic, don't look at the sun.
[02:21:36.960 --> 02:21:37.960]  Don't look at the sunset.
[02:21:37.980 --> 02:21:39.860]  Don't talk to your neighbors all over the place.
[02:21:40.180 --> 02:21:41.321]  Screw these people!
[02:21:42.081 --> 02:21:43.921]  I'm sick of them dictating everything!
[02:21:44.001 --> 02:21:45.242]  I'm tired of their cult!
[02:21:45.922 --> 02:21:47.062]  And I'm not in their cult!
[02:21:47.662 --> 02:21:48.923]  And I want to stop them!
[02:21:48.943 --> 02:21:50.483]  All right.
[02:21:51.043 --> 02:21:52.464]  Doc, you told me you didn't mind if I was ranting.
[02:21:52.524 --> 02:21:52.984]  I'm venting.
[02:21:53.024 --> 02:21:53.924]  I'm feeling a little bit better now.
[02:21:55.742 --> 02:21:59.105]  But I mean, this is me like 10 years ago right now.
[02:21:59.385 --> 02:22:03.648]  I don't know what I'd do if I saw Fauci walking down the street or Bill Gates.
[02:22:03.728 --> 02:22:06.451]  I mean, he's so outrageously evil.
[02:22:06.891 --> 02:22:08.372]  He's such a murderer!
[02:22:08.833 --> 02:22:14.457]  And we need to have, you're a Christian, you're a father, you're a theologian, you're able to be really calm and nice about this.
[02:22:14.497 --> 02:22:17.880]  I know you're pissed off about it, but the thing is, take action, folks.
[02:22:17.960 --> 02:22:20.982]  Resist them, protect yourself from them, expose them.
[02:22:21.783 --> 02:22:25.126]  What do we do biblically, do you think, to just spiritually be able to deal with this?
[02:22:27.230 --> 02:22:29.613]  Well, we can't deal with stuff like this on our own.
[02:22:30.514 --> 02:22:33.318]  You have to lean on God.
[02:22:34.059 --> 02:22:38.866]  You have to, because when you look at what He is, He knows the beginning from the end.
[02:22:38.906 --> 02:22:40.848]  He knows everything that we're going through.
[02:22:41.449 --> 02:22:44.233]  In the midst of the storm, He brings peace.
[02:22:45.120 --> 02:22:45.280]  Right?
[02:22:45.320 --> 02:22:49.322]  It's like he'll bring this calming presence because, you know what?
[02:22:49.522 --> 02:22:51.523]  We know how... Here's the thing, Alex.
[02:22:52.044 --> 02:22:54.725]  We know how this game ends.
[02:22:55.345 --> 02:22:56.626]  And we know who wins.
[02:22:57.486 --> 02:22:57.666]  Right?
[02:22:57.787 --> 02:23:00.208]  And the Bible tells us every knee must bow.
[02:23:00.568 --> 02:23:04.150]  The knee of sickness, the knee of disease, the knee of all these things that we're seeing.
[02:23:04.630 --> 02:23:06.971]  And we know what happens to the devil.
[02:23:07.391 --> 02:23:09.032]  Jesus throws him in the pit!
[02:23:09.773 --> 02:23:10.033]  Right?
[02:23:10.173 --> 02:23:12.434]  And so, we know who wins this.
[02:23:12.534 --> 02:23:13.515]  But here's the thing.
[02:23:14.395 --> 02:23:17.498]  God never told us that this life was going to be easy.
[02:23:18.159 --> 02:23:19.040]  He never told us.
[02:23:19.160 --> 02:23:20.842]  In fact, He told us the opposite.
[02:23:21.422 --> 02:23:31.072]  He said, Jesus said, when, you know, take up your cross and follow me, people are going to oppose you for following me, but you know what?
[02:23:31.192 --> 02:23:36.117]  The end result is going to be better if you follow me than if you don't.
[02:23:36.577 --> 02:23:55.306]  Right, so look at the opposition, take the opposition, but never deviate from that path of following truth and following victory, and that strength of God who created the universe, who put all of His creativity in us, because we were created in His image.
[02:23:55.706 --> 02:24:16.939]  We have to realize, we've got that power of God pulsating through our veins every single day because we're created in His image, and when we do that, we can have confidence that, like what Psalms tells us, and we can rest under the shadow of His wings, that the enemy will come near our tent, but they can't come into it, right?
[02:24:16.980 --> 02:24:22.183]  So, we're gonna be opposed, but know that the end game, the end result,
[02:24:22.804 --> 02:24:25.393]  Is good for those that are following truth.
[02:24:25.714 --> 02:24:28.243]  And I totally agree and history shows it and God's real.
[02:24:29.216 --> 02:24:29.997]  Look at the enemy.
[02:24:30.357 --> 02:24:31.258]  They're all slaves.
[02:24:31.338 --> 02:24:32.539]  Satan always destroys them.
[02:24:32.599 --> 02:24:34.600]  Even before they die, we see them betrayed.
[02:24:34.940 --> 02:24:35.881]  We see them destroyed.
[02:24:35.901 --> 02:24:44.668]  And we see billions and billions of dollars spent by the federal government secretly, with just Walgreens and CVS alone, to not prescribe ivermectin.
[02:24:45.028 --> 02:24:49.751]  So all this evil, you wonder, why are they not giving people the drugs that they now admit works?
[02:24:50.112 --> 02:24:51.333]  Because they wanted to hurt people.
[02:24:51.373 --> 02:24:52.333]  They wanted people fearful.
[02:24:52.634 --> 02:24:57.898]  But it took billions to buy them off to do the evil, and the devil has the control of the purse.
[02:24:58.738 --> 02:25:00.680]  He has the power of the earth right now.
[02:25:00.720 --> 02:25:02.122]  He's the god of this world right now.
[02:25:02.342 --> 02:25:09.530]  But it shows every bit of it is mercenaries working against their own self-interest for a little bit of money.
[02:25:13.319 --> 02:25:14.119]  It's all about money.
[02:25:14.139 --> 02:25:15.360]  It's all about greed.
[02:25:15.780 --> 02:25:18.642]  And here's where money isn't evil.
[02:25:18.962 --> 02:25:22.804]  The love of money is the root of all kinds of evil, right?
[02:25:23.204 --> 02:25:26.186]  So these people love money and they love the control.
[02:25:26.686 --> 02:25:28.607]  And you go back to the Founding Fathers.
[02:25:28.967 --> 02:25:33.089]  The Founding Fathers did not want a central bank.
[02:25:33.310 --> 02:25:34.870]  In fact, they warned against it.
[02:25:35.291 --> 02:25:37.792]  If you go back to the Constitution, sound money
[02:25:38.072 --> 02:25:39.012]  Was gold or silver.
[02:25:39.492 --> 02:25:40.793]  I mean, it just was.
[02:25:41.033 --> 02:25:41.993]  Because it was real.
[02:25:42.253 --> 02:25:43.034]  It's transparent.
[02:25:43.094 --> 02:25:44.074]  It has accountability.
[02:25:44.414 --> 02:25:50.116]  You can't manipulate something that has to be made like that where you can by printing a red button on a printing press.
[02:25:50.616 --> 02:26:03.580]  So, we're actually, all this garbage that's happening Alex, everything that we've talked about for this first hour, boy, there is things that are being changed right now, right underneath our nose.
[02:26:04.100 --> 02:26:06.741]  For example, Nebraska.
[02:26:07.620 --> 02:26:10.049]  Earlier this, well, it was the end of last week.
[02:26:10.069 --> 02:26:11.915]  Oh, I meant to erase that.
[02:26:12.477 --> 02:26:13.239]  Explain what happened.
[02:26:13.280 --> 02:26:13.661]  It's huge.
[02:26:14.656 --> 02:26:16.017]  Yeah, this is massive.
[02:26:16.117 --> 02:26:18.258]  And there's a couple of things that are starting to happen.
[02:26:18.319 --> 02:26:32.728]  So, last week, Nebraska passed a bill that said when you sell, as an owner of gold or silver, when you sell it, there's no more, basically, state income taxes on gold or silver sales.
[02:26:33.109 --> 02:26:34.950]  Explain why that's so huge.
[02:26:35.050 --> 02:26:37.051]  Explain why that's so huge.
[02:26:37.432 --> 02:26:38.852]  No capital gains tax in the state.
[02:26:38.892 --> 02:26:39.253]  Explain that.
[02:26:40.831 --> 02:26:45.595]  Yeah, so whenever you sell anything, stock bond, mutual fund, gold, silver, it doesn't matter.
[02:26:46.055 --> 02:26:51.660]  You know, when you have a gain, you pay capital gains taxes, short term or long term, you know, they're taxed differently.
[02:26:52.120 --> 02:26:56.784]  But what Nebraska just said is the CBDCs are unlawful money.
[02:26:57.264 --> 02:27:01.267]  The only thing that's actually real is gold and silver, and we're not going to tax
[02:27:02.228 --> 02:27:03.609]  Currency transactions.
[02:27:03.989 --> 02:27:16.294]  So therefore, when you sell gold or silver, and let's say you bought silver when it was $17 an ounce and you sell it at $40 an ounce, there's no tax on that gain in Nebraska anymore at the state level.
[02:27:16.694 --> 02:27:19.335]  But now, take it one step further.
[02:27:19.955 --> 02:27:30.019]  This is where in everything that we're talking about, and people have a tendency to put their head in the sands, you know, out of fear they just want to hide and forget about it and brush it under the rug.
[02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:32.762]  You've got Representative Mooney, U.S.
[02:27:32.822 --> 02:27:33.023]  Rep.
[02:27:33.083 --> 02:27:45.016]  Mooney from West Virginia, is basically proposing legislation floating a bill that makes gold and silver transactions federal tax-free, right?
[02:27:45.056 --> 02:27:49.961]  So no taxes at the federal level when you sell gold or silver.
[02:27:50.362 --> 02:27:51.123]  That's a U.S.
[02:27:51.163 --> 02:27:51.844]  Representative
[02:27:52.324 --> 02:27:53.806]  Putting this in front of Congress.
[02:27:54.046 --> 02:27:56.249]  Now, who knows if it's going to pass or not, right?
[02:27:56.309 --> 02:28:02.637]  But what we have is hope that people are starting to look in this direction of sound money.
[02:28:03.358 --> 02:28:08.525]  That what we have since 1913 with the Federal Reserve Act,
[02:28:09.505 --> 02:28:10.185]  Is that real?
[02:28:10.926 --> 02:28:15.208]  You can't say that somebody can actually charge the U.S.
[02:28:15.328 --> 02:28:23.372]  interest by printing money out of thin air, by pressing the red button on the printing press, which is what the Federal Reserve does, and count that as real.
[02:28:23.793 --> 02:28:29.776]  But when you control people's money like with central bank digital currency, this is why Nebraska said it's unlawful,
[02:28:30.636 --> 02:28:35.538]  The Founding Fathers knew that absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[02:28:35.878 --> 02:28:43.980]  They didn't want this centralized power of banking into the hands of a central bank and these cartel-owning families.
[02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:47.901]  They wanted Congress to determine what money was.
[02:28:47.941 --> 02:28:50.522]  They wanted something that was real, something that was tangible.
[02:28:50.582 --> 02:28:53.603]  Now, I was at a meeting last week
[02:28:55.123 --> 02:28:58.766]  And you can look at the website Transactionalgold.com.
[02:28:58.846 --> 02:29:16.979]  So, there's a group that's bringing, you know, in Texas, a central bank, state chartered central bank, you know, the depository that has gold, that you can attach a debit card to it to get out of the federal system, get out of the Fed now, get out of the Federal Reserve, right?
[02:29:17.019 --> 02:29:22.023]  And there's a list on their website on Transactionalgold.com that I was looking at and it's like,
[02:29:22.683 --> 02:29:29.646]  I had no idea, and I'm in this business, right, that actually this momentum was being created.
[02:29:29.806 --> 02:29:32.207]  And Dr. Cruz, great, I can't even keep track of it.
[02:29:32.227 --> 02:29:33.847]  You sent me like 50 articles and clips.
[02:29:34.608 --> 02:29:38.609]  I know you sent it to me, which... I didn't even send you this one.
[02:29:38.649 --> 02:29:45.332]  I'm just thinking of it off the top of my head, but transactionalgold.com, people can look it up, and go to active states.
[02:29:45.772 --> 02:29:47.973]  So listen to this list of states, Alex.
[02:29:48.797 --> 02:29:51.058]  Mississippi legislation filed.
[02:29:51.298 --> 02:29:57.182]  Every one of these things I'm talking about is to make gold or silver legal tender in those states.
[02:29:57.222 --> 02:29:57.622]  Beautiful.
[02:29:57.642 --> 02:29:58.062]  Okay.
[02:29:58.703 --> 02:30:00.524]  Mississippi legislation filed.
[02:30:00.704 --> 02:30:02.385]  Kansas, a hearing scheduled.
[02:30:02.805 --> 02:30:04.566]  Florida legislation filed.
[02:30:04.986 --> 02:30:06.847]  Utah, the study bill was signed.
[02:30:07.328 --> 02:30:07.908]  Arizona,
[02:30:08.348 --> 02:30:12.631]  Moved out of committee already, so now next thing you do is it goes to the floor for a vote.
[02:30:13.251 --> 02:30:14.732]  Iowa legislation filed.
[02:30:14.952 --> 02:30:16.713]  Missouri legislation filed.
[02:30:16.993 --> 02:30:18.935]  Oklahoma legislation filed.
[02:30:18.975 --> 02:30:22.137]  Wisconsin and Alaska legislation filed.
[02:30:22.157 --> 02:30:23.317]  It's like, oh my word.
[02:30:23.537 --> 02:30:29.761]  And then you've got other states where it's already legal tender like Louisiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Wyoming.
[02:30:29.781 --> 02:30:32.183]  I mean, this is amazing, Alex, that
[02:30:32.603 --> 02:30:36.828]  That this is starting to happen where states' rights are coming to the forefront.
[02:30:36.908 --> 02:30:45.237]  They're opposing the federal government overreach and central banking to actually have gold and silver sound money in these states.
[02:30:45.658 --> 02:30:48.721]  Now you've got Nebraska saying, we're not going to tax
[02:30:49.522 --> 02:30:54.165]  We're not going to tax at the state level any gains on the sale of gold or silver.
[02:30:54.646 --> 02:30:59.869]  And I pray that Representative Mooney can actually can get this bill passed.
[02:30:59.909 --> 02:31:03.872]  I mean, imagine a world where we're going back to sound money.
[02:31:04.332 --> 02:31:06.814]  And so, you know, kind of a little little side note.
[02:31:07.434 --> 02:31:10.857]  Any of you watching this, contact your U.S.
[02:31:10.937 --> 02:31:17.762]  representative and say, hey, this bill that Mooney sponsored for sound money to not tax gold and silver.
[02:31:18.747 --> 02:31:20.388]  Do you bother them?
[02:31:34.512 --> 02:31:45.905]  Is that it shows a general education about getting off the gold and silver standard back in the 1970s and the fact that it's tied to nothing and people are searching for something real.
[02:31:45.945 --> 02:31:50.190]  So looking at crypto and I think that's part of the basket of things as long as it's a, you know, one that's
[02:31:50.891 --> 02:31:52.232]  One of the few real ones out there.
[02:31:52.713 --> 02:32:04.243]  But when it gets to property, and your health, and a relationship with God, and family, and knowing how to skin a buck, run a trot line, knowing how to machine parts, knowing how to be a plumber, doctors.
[02:32:04.844 --> 02:32:06.745]  In a small town, if things collapse...
[02:32:07.796 --> 02:32:12.379]  You don't have to be a doctor, a mechanic, a farmer, a midwife, but you've got to have all those together.
[02:32:12.419 --> 02:32:18.263]  And if everybody has skills, it goes back to us having the skills together to survive.
[02:32:18.303 --> 02:32:29.431]  That's why the globalists want to ban those skills and dumb us down so that only the big corporations have those skills to have full, absolute control to then carry out the depopulation so no one can stand against them.
[02:32:29.891 --> 02:32:30.772]  But this really shows
[02:32:31.681 --> 02:32:37.427]  At the state level, all over the country, a huge understanding of that and a real hunger.
[02:32:38.792 --> 02:32:45.915]  As the central bank digital currencies roll out, as the whole New World Order comes in, there is a huge counteraction for every action.
[02:32:45.935 --> 02:32:47.295]  There's an opposite and equal reaction.
[02:32:47.556 --> 02:32:52.237]  Newtonian physics responding to that, and it's beautiful, and it's exciting.
[02:32:52.257 --> 02:32:58.940]  So what you were saying earlier, we know evil exists, but we know good exists, and the good is way more creative and way more powerful and of God.
[02:32:59.180 --> 02:33:01.121]  And so have faith, folks, myself included.
[02:33:01.141 --> 02:33:04.602]  I get really mad to understand when we see this marveling evil.
[02:33:04.903 --> 02:33:06.983]  You know, John Patmos marveled at the beast.
[02:33:07.003 --> 02:33:08.404]  It was so incredible and evil and big.
[02:33:08.744 --> 02:33:13.687]  But God is going to then stand up a standard against it when the enemy comes in like a flood.
[02:33:13.707 --> 02:33:22.212]  I mean, this is absolutely 100% true and this is so exciting that people are waking up.
[02:33:22.272 --> 02:33:27.616]  This is proof that people are waking up, that legislators are waking up at the state level.
[02:33:27.956 --> 02:33:29.317]  This is just human nature.
[02:33:30.217 --> 02:33:36.042]  Alex, we all get so frustrated when people are controlling us that shouldn't control us, right?
[02:33:36.562 --> 02:33:47.110]  So, with the fact that now state legislators are saying, this should be in our sphere of reference, not the federal government's, let's kick him out!
[02:33:47.911 --> 02:33:54.856]  If the state can do it, this is federalism, this is how it works, this is what the founding fathers envisioned.
[02:33:55.257 --> 02:33:58.679]  If a state can do it, then the federal government shouldn't.
[02:33:59.540 --> 02:34:04.842]  And if it's something the federal government needs to do, like a national defense, then the states shouldn't, right?
[02:34:04.902 --> 02:34:07.263]  So this is a separation of powers.
[02:34:07.684 --> 02:34:10.605]  So can a state have its own bank?
[02:34:11.325 --> 02:34:12.786]  Of course they can.
[02:34:12.866 --> 02:34:14.166]  Anybody can make a bank, right?
[02:34:14.226 --> 02:34:16.247]  So the feds don't need to do it.
[02:34:16.387 --> 02:34:18.048]  And again, this isn't just patriots.
[02:34:18.408 --> 02:34:20.049]  When you and I were around 30 years ago,
[02:34:20.589 --> 02:34:25.331]  Well, 50 years ago calling for this and it was like little weird meetings at hotels with 20 people.
[02:34:25.651 --> 02:34:31.833]  It's now passing legislatures and all and being introduced everywhere at the federal level and it's hot and people get it!
[02:34:32.373 --> 02:34:33.053]  Exactly!
[02:34:33.833 --> 02:34:35.334]  So positive things are happening.
[02:34:36.598 --> 02:34:45.404]  Positive things and and it's You don't even have to be very smart to actually realize that this is really good stuff, right?
[02:34:45.464 --> 02:34:47.385]  So so this is okay.
[02:34:47.846 --> 02:34:56.972]  We've got a couple more videos to watch but one of them the second one that we I want to watch is is your favorite guy in mind Harari and
[02:34:58.112 --> 02:35:00.233]  Yeah, let's play clip five first.
[02:35:00.253 --> 02:35:02.054]  You all know Harari or later.
[02:35:02.294 --> 02:35:05.255]  You want to play Dr. Michael Yeadon first, former Vice President of Pfizer?
[02:35:05.275 --> 02:35:08.556]  Let's play the doctor first and then Harari second because that'll be a good one.
[02:35:08.636 --> 02:35:08.976]  Perfect.
[02:35:08.996 --> 02:35:10.597]  Okay, let's play clip one right now.
[02:35:10.637 --> 02:35:10.917]  Here it is.
[02:35:11.567 --> 02:35:17.111]  We are living in a peri-tyrannical situation where there's only two clicks left.
[02:35:17.732 --> 02:35:27.779]  When you are required to have digital ID to move around and have a life, and when cashless central bank digital currencies are the only way you can buy and sell, at that point you've lost your freedom.
[02:35:28.299 --> 02:35:30.681]  If you follow the breadcrumbs to 2030,
[02:35:33.536 --> 02:35:38.822]  Anyone can look up the UN 2030 SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals.
[02:35:39.242 --> 02:35:45.830]  By 2030, Britain specifically will have no commercial passenger aircraft leaving the country.
[02:35:45.870 --> 02:35:46.871]  You will not be able to leave.
[02:35:47.231 --> 02:35:49.614]  There will be no ships leaving the country.
[02:35:49.634 --> 02:35:52.137]  You will not own private transport.
[02:35:52.857 --> 02:35:58.843]  You will have a digital ID to do everything, and you will only have electronic money with which to transact.
[02:35:59.163 --> 02:36:00.945]  I would say at that point you are a slave.
[02:36:01.345 --> 02:36:03.967]  And because you can see them coming, you should say no.
[02:36:04.688 --> 02:36:05.549]  Say no right now.
[02:36:05.869 --> 02:36:06.109]  Stop.
[02:36:09.956 --> 02:36:16.604]  And then you see Eric Adams of New York saying, we're going to track via your ID all the meat you eat, and we're going to start banning it.
[02:36:16.744 --> 02:36:29.700]  I mean, people can't, you know, we have this normalcy bias, Dr. Elliott, that we've lived in relative freedom so long that now that like the most hardcore, insane, satanic tyranny is here, people are like, come on, and it's here!
[02:36:31.462 --> 02:36:43.111]  Well, people are so used to, I don't know, rogue conservative podcasters talking about Agenda 2030, and it was such a big conspiracy like 15 years ago.
[02:36:43.151 --> 02:36:47.354]  It's like, you guys are just crazy tinfoil hat wearing weirdos, right?
[02:36:47.414 --> 02:36:53.499]  But now, when it's all in front of us, people don't know how to, it's like, I've heard this before.
[02:36:53.519 --> 02:36:56.401]  Was this really real this whole time?
[02:36:56.421 --> 02:36:59.043]  It's like, yes, it was real the whole time.
[02:37:00.024 --> 02:37:04.910]  Alex, when you talk about things, when I talk about things, it's not like we're making it up.
[02:37:05.070 --> 02:37:07.913]  We're just reading off of their own minutes.
[02:37:07.973 --> 02:37:17.464]  My uncle was a high-level boss in secret military operations in Iran-Contra, and he left it and got out of it because they were smuggling kidnapped kids.
[02:37:18.601 --> 02:37:21.223]  Okay, I don't even need to see it in the news today.
[02:37:21.703 --> 02:37:25.386]  I told people over a decade ago about it because he told me when he was dying.
[02:37:25.966 --> 02:37:28.809]  And the guy had like four or five silver stars in Vietnam.
[02:37:29.169 --> 02:37:33.672]  And he got, he could not, he goes, they are Satanists and they rape kids.
[02:37:34.072 --> 02:37:39.837]  And he wasn't involved, but he built airfields and communications for the CIA and the Pentagon.
[02:37:40.157 --> 02:37:45.441]  And he literally knew what was going on and was running communications and was like, tried to stop it.
[02:37:46.001 --> 02:37:46.562]  So folks,
[02:37:47.302 --> 02:37:48.503]  Again, it's everywhere!
[02:37:48.563 --> 02:37:51.426]  They are Satanists!
[02:37:51.706 --> 02:37:56.551]  You go to the restaurant and feel a little guilty, you order veal, because it's so delicious, but it's a calf!
[02:37:57.412 --> 02:38:00.795]  They don't feel any guilt when they rape children and kill them!
[02:38:01.116 --> 02:38:02.397]  Do you understand, folks?
[02:38:05.282 --> 02:38:07.964]  I mean, Alex, this has been going on for decades.
[02:38:08.264 --> 02:38:09.926]  Decades after decade after decade.
[02:38:09.966 --> 02:38:11.227]  And what was their plan?
[02:38:11.487 --> 02:38:12.828]  To have one world government?
[02:38:13.229 --> 02:38:14.770]  To have one world currency?
[02:38:14.790 --> 02:38:16.351]  To corral people?
[02:38:16.411 --> 02:38:18.873]  To have population reduction?
[02:38:19.434 --> 02:38:23.197]  To have the ability to track you wherever you go?
[02:38:23.217 --> 02:38:25.339]  To get rid of carbon emissions?
[02:38:26.059 --> 02:38:28.781]  I mean, this has been their dream.
[02:38:29.762 --> 02:38:40.365]  Which is why it is weird to me how we started the show with all these people who their dream is now about to become reality are jumping ship.
[02:38:42.146 --> 02:38:45.167]  I think it's because they realize, oh man, people are waking up.
[02:38:45.942 --> 02:38:51.106]  People are waking up and this guy Trump, he's going to win and he's going to expose all of it.
[02:38:51.526 --> 02:38:53.107]  I'm out.
[02:38:53.788 --> 02:38:58.191]  So you look at this kind of stuff, but it's not hard to be.
[02:38:58.571 --> 02:39:05.036]  You don't have to be super smart to understand this when you've got people on the other side that are saying such incredibly dumb stuff.
[02:39:05.656 --> 02:39:05.836]  Right.
[02:39:05.876 --> 02:39:07.318]  So the Harari clip.
[02:39:08.208 --> 02:39:10.829]  Okay, he's supposedly some smart scientist.
[02:39:10.869 --> 02:39:12.829]  He's like an evil scientist to me.
[02:39:13.429 --> 02:39:15.190]  But listen to what he says.
[02:39:15.570 --> 02:39:20.691]  This is... Actually, you just have to watch it, and then I've got to explain.
[02:39:20.731 --> 02:39:21.692]  Here's the thing.
[02:39:21.712 --> 02:39:22.552]  You all know Harari.
[02:39:22.572 --> 02:39:23.892]  He's the high priest at WUF.
[02:39:24.232 --> 02:39:25.493]  He says, resistance is futile.
[02:39:25.553 --> 02:39:26.953]  The human era is over.
[02:39:27.253 --> 02:39:28.393]  The future is not human.
[02:39:29.134 --> 02:39:29.794]  God isn't real.
[02:39:29.814 --> 02:39:30.974]  We're going to create a god.
[02:39:31.334 --> 02:39:32.514]  Humans will all be gotten rid of.
[02:39:32.534 --> 02:39:33.835]  These are all quotes, by the way.
[02:39:33.875 --> 02:39:34.635]  Here's the latest quote.
[02:39:35.185 --> 02:39:39.489]  I look at Bitcoin as a historian.
[02:39:39.509 --> 02:39:44.394]  I don't like it because this is a money built on distrust.
[02:39:45.274 --> 02:39:48.557]  The central idea of Bitcoin is basically electronic gold.
[02:39:49.349 --> 02:39:58.193]  That we don't trust the banks, the governments, so we don't want to give them the ability to create as much money as they like.
[02:39:58.914 --> 02:40:00.594]  So we create this Bitcoin.
[02:40:01.155 --> 02:40:03.216]  It's a currency of distrust.
[02:40:04.076 --> 02:40:07.098]  I do think that the future belongs to electronic money.
[02:40:08.038 --> 02:40:23.298]  But what we've seen over the last centuries is that it's actually a good idea to give banks and governments the ability to create more and more money for themselves in order to build more trust within society.
[02:40:24.611 --> 02:40:38.195]  So I'm not sure what money would look like in 20 years or 30 years, but I hope it will be a currency of greater trust and not a currency of distrust.
[02:40:43.561 --> 02:40:51.710]  I mean, truly, that's one of the dumb... So, the first thing that he said I actually agree with, that Bitcoin is a currency of distrust.
[02:40:52.190 --> 02:40:58.176]  Yeah, people want privacy, they want decentralized blockchain, they don't want the government snooping in on everything that they do.
[02:40:58.717 --> 02:41:03.362]  It is a currency of distrust, but it's also, you know, they want this growth, it's like,
[02:41:03.542 --> 02:41:04.883]  Boy, but it's so risky.
[02:41:05.243 --> 02:41:06.604]  But anyways, currency of distrust.
[02:41:06.885 --> 02:41:13.389]  The second thing that he said, as I first heard it, I thought, this is the dumbest thing that anyone's ever said.
[02:41:14.050 --> 02:41:21.255]  Other than Biden's chief of the Council of Economic Advisers that we heard a few weeks ago, when he was just mumbling around and saying nonsense.
[02:41:21.315 --> 02:41:23.177]  But what did Harari say?
[02:41:23.917 --> 02:41:25.018]  I'll paraphrase it.
[02:41:25.559 --> 02:41:29.222]  He said, inflation will bring trust.
[02:41:29.482 --> 02:41:30.223]  It's like, what?
[02:41:30.243 --> 02:41:34.847]  Because he said, allow the government to print money because that'll bring more trust.
[02:41:35.227 --> 02:41:36.888]  It's like, he's insane.
[02:41:37.149 --> 02:41:38.770]  That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
[02:41:38.810 --> 02:41:41.893]  He knows he's on the ultra-rich end, so they get first use of it.
[02:41:42.193 --> 02:41:44.655]  So no matter, they'll just give themselves more as it's devalued.
[02:41:44.835 --> 02:41:46.537]  For the average person, it spells curtains!
[02:41:47.659 --> 02:41:47.839]  Yeah.
[02:41:48.179 --> 02:41:49.140]  So, but here's what I think.
[02:42:17.759 --> 02:42:19.944]  KEPM.com forward slash gold 720-605-3900.
[02:42:19.964 --> 02:42:20.385]  720-605-3900.
[02:42:20.405 --> 02:42:21.287]  One-minute pitch, Doc.
[02:42:29.741 --> 02:42:31.942]  Yeah, so I'll finish my one-minute pitch.
[02:42:32.342 --> 02:42:32.862]  Call us.
[02:42:33.082 --> 02:42:35.162]  We'll help you navigate through this crisis.
[02:42:35.282 --> 02:42:43.024]  Everything that we've talked about today that's so fearful, we have a solution when you can allocate into things like gold or silver.
[02:42:43.084 --> 02:42:46.685]  Silver's up over 40% literally in the last two and a half months.
[02:42:47.005 --> 02:42:48.286]  That trend should continue.
[02:42:48.666 --> 02:42:52.847]  But what Harari said to end this was inflation brings trust.
[02:42:52.907 --> 02:42:53.507]  No, it doesn't.
[02:42:53.867 --> 02:42:57.288]  What he's using is trust is he's misplacing that.
[02:42:57.648 --> 02:42:59.909]  What he's saying is... Hold on, we'll have time next hour.
[02:42:59.949 --> 02:43:00.790]  Hold on, we'll have time.
[02:43:00.810 --> 02:43:03.531]  See, I'm trying to get you to plug as a sponsor and you won't even do it.
[02:43:03.551 --> 02:43:09.914]  I love you, but just... So, I mean, really, I don't want people to be struck with fear.
[02:43:10.394 --> 02:43:12.295]  So you can call us and we'll help you navigate.
[02:43:12.335 --> 02:43:13.736]  We'll roll over your IRAs.
[02:43:14.036 --> 02:43:18.198]  We'll do what needs to be done to get you out of the path of this hurricane.
[02:43:18.598 --> 02:43:22.220]  And my team, I know I'm biased, Alex, but my team is incredible.
[02:43:22.700 --> 02:43:23.821]  They have a heart for people.
[02:43:23.861 --> 02:43:25.482]  They will bend over backwards to help you.
[02:43:25.502 --> 02:43:26.523]  They're very empathetic.
[02:43:26.563 --> 02:43:29.805]  That's why you have 4.7, 4.7 stars everywhere.
[02:43:29.845 --> 02:43:30.466]  Nobody else does.
[02:43:30.906 --> 02:43:31.166]  All right.
[02:43:31.427 --> 02:43:32.728]  And again, my problem is not fear.
[02:43:32.748 --> 02:43:34.729]  My fear, my fear is getting too angry.
[02:43:35.149 --> 02:43:37.251]  I just, I cannot take these people, man.
[02:43:37.751 --> 02:43:39.533]  I just can't wait till God destroys them.
[02:43:39.553 --> 02:43:39.973]  Stay with us.
[02:43:40.373 --> 02:43:46.355]  Our political elite want nothing more than for you to be ignorant, deceived, censored, silenced, and rendered useless.
[02:43:46.655 --> 02:43:52.156]  But BrainForce Ultra is a great way to fight back because staying sharp is part of winning the InfoWars.

[02:44:10.319 --> 02:44:12.241]  This is so, so important.

[02:45:10.689 --> 02:45:18.674]  All right, we're going to do about 10 more minutes and then the great, he always does a superlative job with his documentation, Jason Burmas never disappoints coming up.
[02:45:19.235 --> 02:45:22.857]  And then the amazing Owen Schroer, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:45:22.957 --> 02:45:30.882]  I'm a little punch drunk from the judge yesterday telling the Democratic Party lawyers, no, I'm not going to shut down InfoWars for you.
[02:45:31.462 --> 02:45:37.026]  I'm going to give it back to Alex Jones if you don't settle with him in the next 20 something days.
[02:45:38.160 --> 02:45:39.841]  I mean, that was just wild.
[02:45:39.961 --> 02:45:42.362]  And of course, then they're going to attack with the state courts.
[02:45:44.163 --> 02:45:45.024]  It's just insane.
[02:45:45.104 --> 02:45:50.967]  I mean, it just gets wilder and wilder, and we just keep trusting in God like the widows might.
[02:45:51.688 --> 02:45:53.749]  And every day it's just back to next day.
[02:45:53.769 --> 02:45:56.070]  But just enough, and God keeps going, see, I'm in control.
[02:45:56.130 --> 02:45:56.891]  Here's more runway.
[02:45:57.171 --> 02:45:58.452]  Trust me, here's more runway.
[02:45:58.712 --> 02:46:00.033]  Trust me, here's more runway.
[02:46:00.053 --> 02:46:03.595]  But God always does that, just letting you know, see, it's me.
[02:46:04.936 --> 02:46:07.699]  Doc, I interrupted you because of the break, and I wanted you to plug what you never do.
[02:46:08.419 --> 02:46:12.404]  You're a great guest, but you're also a great sponsor, so I want you to get a great result and people to get prepared.
[02:46:12.764 --> 02:46:17.369]  My God, just since you were coming on with this, gold's up, silver's up 40%.
[02:46:19.011 --> 02:46:24.096]  It's a no-brainer here, but finishing up, you all know Harari and just how full of crap he is as an economist.
[02:46:24.656 --> 02:46:25.858]  You as an economist watching him.
[02:46:27.099 --> 02:46:30.261]  So I'm watching that and I'm thinking, is this guy absolutely nuts?
[02:46:30.521 --> 02:46:33.604]  I mean, he is a smart guy, he's evil, but he's a smart guy.
[02:46:34.084 --> 02:46:48.714]  How could he say that printing money is going to bring trust when so much in our society right now is people can't afford to eat, they can't afford to pay their mortgage or their rent or buy food or do anything, right?
[02:46:48.914 --> 02:46:52.376]  Inflation doesn't bring trust, right?
[02:46:53.357 --> 02:46:54.317]  What is he saying?
[02:46:54.737 --> 02:46:57.078]  This is where I was ending before the break.
[02:46:57.718 --> 02:46:59.718]  He's misusing the word trust.
[02:47:00.498 --> 02:47:10.900]  Because what he's actually saying is, hey, when we print money, we're going to be able to give you Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, handouts, stimulus.
[02:47:11.580 --> 02:47:14.581]  We'll raise the debt ceiling to keep this game perpetuated.
[02:47:15.261 --> 02:47:16.661]  We'll do all of this stuff.
[02:47:17.281 --> 02:47:19.382]  And so then the people will say,
[02:47:20.322 --> 02:47:20.722]  Trust?
[02:47:20.802 --> 02:47:21.002]  What?
[02:47:21.262 --> 02:47:24.604]  It's like, I'll tolerate you because you're giving me free stuff.
[02:47:25.184 --> 02:47:26.344]  That's not trust.
[02:47:26.805 --> 02:47:30.786]  That's accepting they're garbage because they're giving you free stuff.
[02:47:30.806 --> 02:47:33.267]  That comes with printing of money excessively.
[02:47:33.787 --> 02:47:37.649]  So, misuse of the word trust, because I don't think he's a dumb guy.
[02:47:37.669 --> 02:47:43.931]  I think he's evil, beyond evil, who has no respect for human life, right?
[02:47:43.991 --> 02:47:44.232]  But yet,
[02:47:46.098 --> 02:47:57.046]  He says this and it's like, man, they just said in his words from the World Economic Forum, you know, their biggest evangelist, that we're going to continue to print money.
[02:47:57.467 --> 02:48:08.896]  We're going to continue to make people dependent on the government for all of their needs because the government wants to take the place of God in people's lives.
[02:48:09.356 --> 02:48:13.219]  And that statement, when you dissect what he said, that's what he's saying.
[02:48:14.815 --> 02:48:15.856]  Amazing points.
[02:48:16.056 --> 02:48:17.977]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[02:48:18.277 --> 02:48:18.757]  Check them out.
[02:48:18.797 --> 02:48:19.418]  Go on the site.
[02:48:19.838 --> 02:48:20.278]  Call them.
[02:48:20.298 --> 02:48:21.139]  Get a consultation.
[02:48:21.239 --> 02:48:22.780]  Email them.
[02:48:22.800 --> 02:48:26.002]  Talk to them.
[02:48:26.022 --> 02:48:26.162]  720-605-3900.
[02:48:26.422 --> 02:48:28.063]  Again, that's 720-605-3900.
[02:48:28.303 --> 02:48:33.726]  One of the most important calls you would make, obviously, and like he was saying, get silver.
[02:48:33.746 --> 02:48:35.047]  It's up 40% on the year.
[02:48:35.627 --> 02:48:38.348]  He says he'll make such profits in silver when the gold run starts.
[02:48:38.368 --> 02:48:46.012]  You use that profit to buy the gold and you sell it back to Dr. Kirk Elliott with zero costs, which no big broker, no big company does.
[02:48:46.072 --> 02:48:49.033]  That's why there are 4.7 star ratings that nobody else has.
[02:48:49.713 --> 02:48:52.474]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[02:48:52.934 --> 02:48:56.676]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with that Joe Biden news he just mentioned.
[02:48:56.696 --> 02:48:57.056]  Stay with us.
[02:48:57.076 --> 02:48:58.477]  Big Joe Biden news.
[02:48:59.284 --> 02:49:03.886]  Alright, Jason Burma's getting ready to take over here in a moment, but Dr. Kirk Elliott mentioned this, and it's true.
[02:49:04.327 --> 02:49:07.808]  And this is a lot bigger than a formality, or just, okay, he'll probably get on the ballot.
[02:49:07.889 --> 02:49:09.549]  It shows the arrogance.
[02:49:10.730 --> 02:49:12.751]  Biden got rid of any Democrat debates.
[02:49:12.811 --> 02:49:15.693]  He kept all the Democrat candidate challengers off the ballot.
[02:49:16.213 --> 02:49:17.534]  Talk about election theft.
[02:49:17.574 --> 02:49:19.415]  I mean, it's never been done in U.S.
[02:49:19.435 --> 02:49:19.755]  history.
[02:49:20.675 --> 02:49:21.155]  In 240-something years.
[02:49:23.547 --> 02:49:26.589]  And now, they didn't even fill out the paperwork in Ohio!
[02:49:27.189 --> 02:49:32.792]  I've got the Yahoo News article right here, and Ohio came and said, are you gonna file the paperwork?
[02:49:32.812 --> 02:49:35.593]  They said, we don't need to file no stinking paperwork, bitch!
[02:49:37.234 --> 02:49:37.894]  Joe Biden!
[02:49:39.095 --> 02:49:41.676]  And they went, alright, well, and then they never filed it.
[02:49:43.117 --> 02:49:44.197]  So they didn't put him on the ballot.
[02:49:45.238 --> 02:49:53.142]  The Democrats came back, I just read the article, Kirk, I didn't even know about this, I just scanned over it, and they just said, well you're gonna put him on there anyways, you just violated the law!
[02:49:56.110 --> 02:50:02.652]  And again, this is, this is the, they could have just, it was a, the filing was no money.
[02:50:04.073 --> 02:50:07.074]  But they don't, we don't, we don't fill out paperwork.
[02:50:07.134 --> 02:50:08.574]  Who do you think we are?
[02:50:09.795 --> 02:50:12.096]  We are the Democratic Party, baby.
[02:50:12.116 --> 02:50:15.137]  Dr. Kirk Elliott, closing comments on this.
[02:50:15.457 --> 02:50:18.398]  An obscure provision of Ohio law could keep Joe Biden off the ballot.
[02:50:18.718 --> 02:50:19.878]  Top of Yahoo News right now.
[02:50:20.298 --> 02:50:22.139]  What is their major, it's just like,
[02:50:22.998 --> 02:50:24.098]  They're starting World War III.
[02:50:24.258 --> 02:50:28.940]  All the threat escalation ladders by the Pentagon and War Games show where they're going is going to cause World War III.
[02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:29.640]  They admit that.
[02:50:29.880 --> 02:50:31.140]  That was the Hill newspaper yesterday.
[02:50:31.460 --> 02:50:32.301]  Experts agree.
[02:50:33.301 --> 02:50:34.941]  Democrats want nuclear war.
[02:50:35.081 --> 02:50:40.723]  I mean, it's like they're doing... It's like you pour gasoline on yourself and light it, you burn up, you know.
[02:50:40.963 --> 02:50:44.104]  You drink five gallons of vodka a day, your liver fails.
[02:50:44.224 --> 02:50:47.365]  I mean, they are just... They're mad dogs, Dr. Elliott.
[02:50:49.055 --> 02:50:49.396]  They are.
[02:50:49.476 --> 02:51:00.323]  So you look at this, if this were a conservative that tried to pull this trick, I mean, they would say, but when it's a liberal that does it, what's going to happen?
[02:51:00.363 --> 02:51:06.007]  You're going to have uprisings, you're going to have riots, you're going to have looting, because that's how the left operates.
[02:51:06.428 --> 02:51:13.773]  So what they're doing is they're going to create so much civil unrest that what could the end result be?
[02:51:13.793 --> 02:51:15.554]  It's like, there's so much disarray.
[02:51:15.574 --> 02:51:16.635]  By the way, that's a good point.
[02:51:16.675 --> 02:51:18.096]  They probably did this on purpose.
[02:51:18.956 --> 02:51:19.697]  Yeah.
[02:51:20.077 --> 02:51:22.599]  How can we even have an election with all this madness?
[02:51:22.819 --> 02:51:24.960]  I mean, who knows where this goes?
[02:51:25.281 --> 02:51:27.202]  But you know how the left reacts.
[02:51:27.602 --> 02:51:31.946]  They react through protests and riots and looting and destroying people's property.
[02:51:32.386 --> 02:51:36.369]  And if their guy can't be on the ballot, well, that's what they're going to do.
[02:51:36.809 --> 02:51:40.392]  When they tried to take Trump off the ballot, you didn't see that kind of action.
[02:51:40.432 --> 02:51:41.653]  People were upset and mad.
[02:51:42.593 --> 02:51:53.698]  But this is, I think, I would bet that they want this to happen to create an outcry, right, that will actually divide society even worse.
[02:51:55.054 --> 02:51:55.834]  I totally agree.
[02:51:55.874 --> 02:51:57.495]  Well, people need to get silver.
[02:51:57.535 --> 02:51:58.355]  They need to get gold.
[02:51:58.415 --> 02:52:01.917]  Like you said, you can make even more money on gold, but you steer people away.
[02:52:01.957 --> 02:52:02.877]  You say, get silver.
[02:52:02.917 --> 02:52:05.458]  You'll be able to buy so much silver with your profit.
[02:52:05.779 --> 02:52:08.200]  When gold starts making its run, they've been suppressing it.
[02:52:08.240 --> 02:52:09.100]  Clearly, you can get into gold.
[02:52:09.140 --> 02:52:10.621]  That's what you want, but it doesn't matter.
[02:52:10.701 --> 02:52:11.961]  It's all just a motive exchange.
[02:52:12.181 --> 02:52:13.182]  It's a strategic metal.
[02:52:14.184 --> 02:52:16.305]  Explain that in two minutes when we go to Jason Burma's How.
[02:52:16.745 --> 02:52:21.507]  You predicted this when you were on the air, I guess, seven, eight months ago with us first on this, and now it's happened.
[02:52:21.527 --> 02:52:23.467]  It's gone up, you know, 40%.
[02:52:24.127 --> 02:52:31.310]  Explain where you're going with this, that you make such profit in silver, then when the gold run starts, you get into gold.
[02:52:32.725 --> 02:52:38.590]  Yeah, so for example, on Friday, silver was up 6.02%, gold was up like 1.9.
[02:52:39.051 --> 02:52:42.794]  The other day, silver was up over 3%, gold was up a little over 1.
[02:52:43.254 --> 02:52:47.358]  See, it's outpacing the growth of gold by almost a factor of 3.
[02:52:48.539 --> 02:52:51.222]  Right, so you keep playing that out in time.
[02:52:51.562 --> 02:52:54.224]  Let's say silver grows three times faster than gold.
[02:52:54.585 --> 02:53:04.413]  Well, we'll sell our silver, roll it into gold, you get almost three times as many ounces of gold then than what I could have purchased for you today, with the end result being
[02:53:05.394 --> 02:53:07.095]  Let's redefine wealth here.
[02:53:07.415 --> 02:53:11.616]  Let's stop thinking of wealth in terms of how many paper dollars do you have.
[02:53:12.076 --> 02:53:16.458]  Start to think of wealth as how many ounces do you own or control, right?
[02:53:16.498 --> 02:53:18.458]  Because they keep going up in value.
[02:53:18.838 --> 02:53:20.299]  Paper keeps being diminished.
[02:53:20.339 --> 02:53:22.399]  The more that they print, the more inflation we have.
[02:53:22.439 --> 02:53:23.860]  They devalue that currency.
[02:53:24.560 --> 02:53:27.061]  Where gold and silver maintain its purchasing power.
[02:53:27.101 --> 02:53:31.022]  So let's look at wealth is how many ounces do you own?
[02:53:31.483 --> 02:53:38.805]  This ratio trading strategy that we implement is a way for you to actually compound your ounces over time.
[02:53:40.906 --> 02:53:51.730]  And under alien in closing, that's what they get from you, not just high quality gold and silver bullion at a super low fair price with no cost to sell back, which no big company does.
[02:53:51.790 --> 02:53:53.991]  And you're the biggest out there because you're the best.
[02:53:54.915 --> 02:53:56.216]  Proof is in the pudding.
[02:53:56.936 --> 02:53:58.237]  The success is the quality.
[02:53:58.717 --> 02:54:05.420]  You're giving people real strategy, not some story about a shipwreck of gold so you're paying double for it or silver.
[02:54:06.152 --> 02:54:08.673]  No, you're giving them a real strategy for success.
[02:54:08.713 --> 02:54:12.915]  The best shot they've got out of this whole panopticon of information.
[02:54:12.975 --> 02:54:15.976]  Everybody should go to KEPM.com forward slash gold or 7206053900.
[02:54:16.237 --> 02:54:20.418]  Dr. Elliott, thank you so much.
[02:54:20.799 --> 02:54:22.199]  The interviews just get better and better.
[02:54:22.559 --> 02:54:23.660]  The last one was the best.
[02:54:23.800 --> 02:54:24.840]  The one before that was the best.
[02:54:24.880 --> 02:54:25.481]  I'm not just saying this.
[02:54:25.821 --> 02:54:28.282]  This was a spectacular interview.
[02:54:28.882 --> 02:54:30.263]  Thank you for all the research you did.
[02:54:30.323 --> 02:54:31.303]  We covered about half of it.
[02:54:31.583 --> 02:54:32.344]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:54:33.379 --> 02:54:33.859]  Sounds good.
[02:54:33.960 --> 02:54:34.440]  We'll see you.
[02:54:34.660 --> 02:54:34.860]  Wow.
[02:54:35.281 --> 02:54:38.003]  That was a grand slam, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:38.303 --> 02:54:38.584]  Whoa.
[02:54:39.905 --> 02:54:40.245]  All right.
[02:54:40.425 --> 02:54:43.608]  In 48 minutes, Owen Schroyer takes over.
[02:54:43.648 --> 02:54:46.210]  But first, we're going to skip both network breaks to get this time back.
[02:54:46.531 --> 02:54:49.073]  The mighty Jason Bermas takes over now.
[02:54:50.494 --> 02:54:50.714]  All right.
[02:54:50.734 --> 02:54:52.116]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:54:52.196 --> 02:54:57.620]  And earlier today, Alex was honing in on 3D printed meat.
[02:54:57.700 --> 02:54:59.322]  Let's talk about that for a second.
[02:54:59.958 --> 02:55:13.065]  Number one, they are projecting this to be a half a trillion dollar industry, and it's not just the biomolecular printing of your food supply.
[02:55:13.445 --> 02:55:29.394]  It's really also a transhumanist agenda, and that's why I wanted to get into xenotransplantation, the 3D printing of human organs, not only the ones we're talking about via United Therapeutics and some recent
[02:55:30.393 --> 02:55:36.925]  Surgeries that have actually taken place but also via NASA in low Earth orbit.
[02:55:36.945 --> 02:55:42.955]  A lot of people are not aware of that aspect of this but it is integral into what we're going to be talking about.
[02:55:43.892 --> 02:55:51.761]  United Therapeutics is owned by a person named Martine Rothblatt, formerly Martin Rothblatt.
[02:55:52.382 --> 02:56:00.050]  And this book, we're going to meet Martin and really you're going to see a propaganda piece based on this person promoting all this.
[02:56:00.711 --> 02:56:02.533]  It doesn't just end.
[02:56:03.602 --> 02:56:14.669]  With printing organs because hey, I'm not a Luddite technology that empowers human beings if we can 3D print organs and allow people to live longer and replace these things.
[02:56:15.270 --> 02:56:28.018]  Absolutely, but this is a pathway down this unzipped jeans taking charge of baby making in the new millennium and Martine before we play this clip.
[02:56:28.459 --> 02:56:33.262]  I want everybody to understand is also the author of this right here.
[02:56:33.860 --> 02:56:52.029]  From Transgender to Transhuman, a manifesto on the freedom of form, where right in the very beginning they advocate that putting the sex of your child, the biological sex of your child at birth on a certificate will be likened to that of apartheid South Africa.
[02:56:52.109 --> 02:56:54.610]  Now, remember Martin Rothblatt
[02:56:55.416 --> 02:57:00.640]  is in fact the CEO of the company that recently did this transplant.
[02:57:00.660 --> 02:57:06.564]  Then we're going to show you a second transplant that's also taken place, but let's hit the clip.
[02:57:07.569 --> 02:57:10.610]  Imagine a world where organ shortages are a thing of the past.
[02:57:10.790 --> 02:57:16.232]  A recent medical breakthrough has offered a glimmer of hope for thousands of people waiting for life-saving transplants.
[02:57:16.293 --> 02:57:27.317]  And we spoke to a transplant surgeon at the University of Alabama at Birmingham about the recent case of a person who received a genetically modified pig kidney and the future of xenotransplantation.
[02:57:27.937 --> 02:57:39.602]  In a recent medical milestone, 62-year-old Richard Slayman received a pig kidney in a groundbreaking xenotransplantation procedure while he sadly passed away this week.
[02:57:40.022 --> 02:57:43.144]  Experts believe... Now let me just start with something, okay?
[02:57:44.004 --> 02:57:48.566]  This is a New York hospital, and you notice the picture everybody took together.
[02:57:48.606 --> 02:57:52.248]  Now they weren't about to just go into surgery, you know, he hasn't been prepped.
[02:57:52.568 --> 02:57:54.169]  Everybody's wearing the slave mask.
[02:57:54.669 --> 02:57:56.910]  I'm just gonna say this, I'm not big.
[02:57:57.640 --> 02:58:08.393]  I'm taking medical advice or doing any medical procedures on anyone still wearing slave masks that want to promote something for me, right?
[02:58:09.074 --> 02:58:17.144]  And it's amazing after you see the result of this how they still push forward as this as though this was a positive outcome, but we'll get there.
[02:58:18.111 --> 02:58:20.993]  This marks a significant scientific breakthrough.
[02:58:21.013 --> 02:58:24.795]  UAB professor Jamie Locke with the Hirsing School of Medicine.
[02:58:24.815 --> 02:58:26.857]  It's a huge step forward.
[02:58:27.917 --> 02:58:33.681]  And I think, you know, Mr. Slaman will always be remembered as a hero and a pioneer in these efforts.
[02:58:33.821 --> 02:58:37.083]  According to reports, the pig kidney itself functioned well.
[02:58:37.563 --> 02:58:43.346]  And the cause of Slaman's death was likely complications from being on dialysis for an extended period.
[02:58:43.366 --> 02:58:44.987]  So let's talk about that.
[02:58:45.007 --> 02:58:46.168]  Again, they're still promoting it.
[02:58:46.880 --> 02:58:49.723]  The guy died about two months later.
[02:58:49.803 --> 02:58:59.213]  Now, again, I don't know whether it was the extensive dialysis, but there's still a positive spin after the FDA approval.
[02:58:59.253 --> 02:59:07.301]  Now, we're going to show you a woman who not only went through this procedure, but also an artificial heart procedure on top of it.
[02:59:09.076 --> 02:59:10.777]  She's still alive as far as I know.
[02:59:11.098 --> 02:59:21.405]  I think it's about four weeks ago that this took place, but you watch the production of this, and this is how they're selling it to people.
[02:59:21.866 --> 02:59:22.246]  It's got
[02:59:22.842 --> 02:59:27.426]  The music in the background, it's playing on your heartstrings, etc.
[02:59:27.766 --> 02:59:33.671]  There's a lot of PR, public relations, aka propaganda, behind the selling of all of this.
[02:59:34.191 --> 02:59:43.259]  So, this woman right here, again, as far as I know, still around, hasn't hit the two-month mark like the last individual, but let's play this clip.
[02:59:44.207 --> 02:59:47.469]  So Lisa had both heart and kidney failure.
[02:59:47.669 --> 02:59:52.432]  She was pretty disappointed when she found out she really didn't have any options.
[02:59:52.712 --> 02:59:56.035]  She wasn't a candidate for a heart kidney transplant.
[02:59:56.315 --> 03:00:01.278]  She was getting sicker and sicker and really, you know, her life expectancy
[03:00:02.125 --> 03:00:04.608]  Could be measured in days or weeks.
[03:00:05.288 --> 03:00:17.180]  And then when we presented this concept to her of a pig kidney transplant that would enable her to have better heart function as well.
[03:00:17.920 --> 03:00:20.422]  She was really excited to try it.
[03:00:20.582 --> 03:00:28.789]  She has been really steadfast in her desire to a xenotransplant with the hope that it could extend her life.
[03:00:28.969 --> 03:00:31.811]  I wanted to tell you we got some really good news from the FDA.
[03:00:32.692 --> 03:00:36.035]  That they've given us the green light to move forward.
[03:00:36.075 --> 03:00:37.656]  So, that's wonderful.
[03:00:37.696 --> 03:00:37.836]  Yeah.
[03:00:37.896 --> 03:00:41.859]  Well, I'm willing to take the risks because listening to what the doctors had said,
[03:00:43.281 --> 03:00:49.729]  I have a strong, strong feeling that it'll go smoothly and won't be any problems.
[03:00:49.749 --> 03:00:54.234]  We've combined two very advanced new technologies.
[03:00:54.535 --> 03:00:55.556]  LVAD placement.
[03:00:56.318 --> 03:00:59.940]  Followed by a Xeno Kidney Transplant.
[03:00:59.980 --> 03:01:02.421]  She's making really steady progress every day.
[03:01:02.441 --> 03:01:08.885]  It's still early days, but the rate of her progress has really been remarkable.
[03:01:09.005 --> 03:01:23.073]  This unique combining of these two really advanced technologies, the Left Ventricular Assist Device and a Xeno Transplant, could open up new doors for people who need
[03:01:23.613 --> 03:01:26.014]  So, you know, once again, promoting it out there and look,
[03:01:43.861 --> 03:01:54.366]  If this is going to extend life and it's going to be available to the general public, I don't necessarily have a problem with that, but it is bringing us into that realm of also biomimetics.
[03:01:54.966 --> 03:01:57.667]  All right, and very early on in the COVID-1984 nightmare, I argued
[03:02:00.368 --> 03:02:07.954]  Even before they had announced that mRNA were going to be the hate and lie shots, that this was a very transhumanist agenda.
[03:02:07.974 --> 03:02:09.755]  There were a lot of reasons to say that.
[03:02:09.795 --> 03:02:10.996]  They wanted to keep us apart.
[03:02:11.256 --> 03:02:14.598]  They wanted to keep us away from facial expressions.
[03:02:14.718 --> 03:02:19.802]  Obviously, the way that they handled it medically was atrocious.
[03:02:20.502 --> 03:02:25.346]  But at the same time, all this other futuristic technology, including what?
[03:02:25.996 --> 03:02:30.080]  Biometrics, the QR codes, etc.
[03:02:30.881 --> 03:02:33.544]  AR, VR, they were apparent.
[03:02:33.905 --> 03:02:40.071]  You know, I want to hit this clip right here and remind people how far they went down that path.
[03:02:40.091 --> 03:02:40.972]  Let's make sure I got it.
[03:02:41.012 --> 03:02:43.495]  Yes, this was sold to people in Ireland.
[03:02:44.247 --> 03:02:44.627]  Okay.
[03:02:45.128 --> 03:02:51.131]  And, you know, again, everybody's got a happy face and a smile on, can't wait to put the mask, there's threat assessment levels.
[03:02:52.152 --> 03:02:56.174]  But again, this is, it's all intertwined.
[03:02:56.954 --> 03:03:09.342]  From the transhumanism of biomolecular printing of organs, which we're going to show you, again, is not just xenotransplantation, but NASA, to the biometrics, to the control grids surrounding it.
[03:03:09.822 --> 03:03:11.623]  So let's hit this clip right here.
[03:03:14.510 --> 03:03:21.471]  Let me just hit this for a second.
[03:03:21.972 --> 03:03:23.652]  That's a risk level bar.
[03:03:23.672 --> 03:03:25.712]  Okay, I want everybody to see that.
[03:03:25.772 --> 03:03:26.893]  It says risk level.
[03:03:27.453 --> 03:03:29.153]  Alright, so you got your risk levels.
[03:03:29.933 --> 03:03:30.813]  Everybody's smiling.
[03:03:30.833 --> 03:03:31.433]  Let's bring it back.
[03:03:31.453 --> 03:03:32.594]  Oh, it's time to go in.
[03:03:33.114 --> 03:03:34.734]  Oh, we're gonna go inside now.
[03:03:34.774 --> 03:03:36.134]  We better put our masks on.
[03:03:40.275 --> 03:03:40.975]  Oh, it's okay.
[03:03:40.995 --> 03:03:42.916]  See, it wasn't okay before the mask.
[03:03:44.772 --> 03:03:46.273]  Scan the phones.
[03:03:46.373 --> 03:03:46.833]  Okay, great.
[03:03:46.853 --> 03:03:47.674]  There's your ID.
[03:03:47.974 --> 03:03:49.475]  See, it's integrated with the ID.
[03:03:49.535 --> 03:03:51.336]  Isn't that lovely?
[03:03:51.376 --> 03:03:52.517]  But you're at a friend's house.
[03:03:53.357 --> 03:03:55.278]  The threat level's a little bit lower, right?
[03:03:55.879 --> 03:03:59.481]  And it's a good thing they have something to chemically put on your hands.
[03:04:01.121 --> 03:04:02.862]  You gotta wash your hands all the time.
[03:04:03.303 --> 03:04:03.843]  Insanity.
[03:04:04.203 --> 03:04:06.585]  Gotta get the music, the mood.
[03:04:06.705 --> 03:04:08.326]  Oh, we're gonna open that window!
[03:04:13.220 --> 03:04:16.102]  Not like you're not going to breathe the same air together.
[03:04:17.422 --> 03:04:17.803]  All right?
[03:04:18.363 --> 03:04:32.571]  Now, I wanted to talk about that xeno-transplantation and just show everybody that you can go to NASA's own site, and as of December of last year, they have a whole thing on their 3D bioprinting.
[03:04:33.631 --> 03:04:35.452]  Yeah, you can see some of the processes.
[03:04:35.692 --> 03:04:39.194]  They're also into the Hydrogel experimentation.
[03:04:39.535 --> 03:04:54.743]  When I talked to Greg Autry about the 3D printing in particular, he said, basically, in low Earth orbit, you are able to do things and print in a three-dimensional realm that's not flat.
[03:04:55.742 --> 03:04:57.843]  Because of that low Earth orbit.
[03:04:58.103 --> 03:05:01.444]  There's a couple articles out there as of February that you can go check out.
[03:05:02.385 --> 03:05:10.008]  This article is dealing with a slew of different tissue that is being 3D bioprinted.
[03:05:10.048 --> 03:05:15.009]  And this is honing in right here on behalf of the World Government Summit.
[03:05:16.170 --> 03:05:17.270]  Can't make this stuff up.
[03:05:18.651 --> 03:05:20.591]  On heart tissue in particular.
[03:05:21.132 --> 03:05:21.512]  Okay?
[03:05:22.072 --> 03:05:24.413]  But various diseases on Earth experts say crucial.
[03:05:25.342 --> 03:05:26.002]  Crucial!
[03:05:27.122 --> 03:05:27.743]  With this stuff.
[03:05:28.203 --> 03:05:28.563]  All right?
[03:05:29.063 --> 03:05:43.606]  Now, as I was showing you, Martine Rothblatt, America's highest paid female CEO, that's a decade ago, talks quote-unquote transcendence, because also, this is an acolyte of Kurzweil.
[03:05:43.646 --> 03:05:45.806]  This is someone that wants to live forever.
[03:05:46.667 --> 03:05:47.007]  All right?
[03:05:47.127 --> 03:05:53.068]  And when you look at biotechnology, this person is the inventor of the Sirius XM satellite radio.
[03:05:53.820 --> 03:06:11.019]  Again, we're going to play this, you know, basically propaganda piece, in my opinion, on Ralph Blatt in a moment, but this person is speaking this year at the Maryland School of Medicine's 215th graduating class.
[03:06:11.380 --> 03:06:12.221]  Pay attention.
[03:06:12.947 --> 03:06:19.371]  In modern medicine, United Therapeutics and Rothblatt are people to know.
[03:06:19.611 --> 03:06:21.932]  Notice this just happened earlier in the month.
[03:06:22.392 --> 03:06:24.534]  Sold 1.7 million in company stock.
[03:06:24.794 --> 03:06:33.058]  Probably wanted to make some kind of a profit on the heels of not only the FDA approval, but the first human xenotransplantation out there.
[03:06:33.919 --> 03:06:39.402]  Before we get into Rothblatt themselves, I want to show this right here.
[03:06:40.215 --> 03:06:40.775]  Let's show this one.
[03:06:40.795 --> 03:06:47.877]  This is actually technology of bio-nanotech that is in Israel.
[03:06:48.017 --> 03:06:53.438]  And I noticed earlier today Alex was showing Netanyahu eating the 3D printed meat in Israel.
[03:06:53.738 --> 03:06:58.840]  Well, this is bio-nanotech to basically stop and treat paralysis.
[03:06:59.320 --> 03:07:00.340]  All right, I want to show people again.
[03:07:01.147 --> 03:07:05.349]  These technologies can be used to empower humanity, but right now, what am I seeing?
[03:07:05.389 --> 03:07:12.311]  I'm seeing the enslavement of humanity, the limitation of the types of medicines that we can have.
[03:07:12.331 --> 03:07:20.414]  For instance, when we're talking about DNAs in general, we're talking about long lists of amino acids, aka peptides, and what has the FDA recently done?
[03:07:21.015 --> 03:07:24.436]  They have taken away these peptides and said they are harmful.
[03:07:30.983 --> 03:07:42.913]  Our technology is based on taking a small tissue biopsy from the stomach of the patient and separating the extracellular matrix and the cells from this tissue.
[03:07:43.434 --> 03:07:55.343]  While the extracellular matrix, the biomaterial, is processed into a personalized hydrogel, the cells are reprogrammed to become embryonic stem cell-like cells.
[03:07:55.784 --> 03:07:58.566]  And you notice he just mentioned the word hydrogel again.
[03:07:59.201 --> 03:08:04.363]  This is why we're constantly talking about NASA, NASA working on the hydrogels.
[03:08:05.084 --> 03:08:11.827]  This is the biomimetics that we're now in because we are in the bio nano IT era.
[03:08:11.867 --> 03:08:15.449]  In fact, let's just go to this document really quickly.
[03:08:15.929 --> 03:08:20.731]  Last week when I hosted the show, I showed you clips of Dennis Bushnell.
[03:08:21.397 --> 03:08:28.260]  So Bushnell is no longer the chief scientist, but this, as far as I know, is one of his latest papers, and it is from November of 2020.
[03:08:28.520 --> 03:08:32.962]  Okay, November of 2020, right here.
[03:08:33.342 --> 03:08:37.724]  So, this is into the realm of the pandemic.
[03:08:38.584 --> 03:08:46.808]  Everything biological, I mean, he tells you we're in the IT, bio, nano, and now quantum and energetic technologies level now.
[03:08:47.426 --> 03:08:47.986]  This is now.
[03:08:48.046 --> 03:08:56.470]  He tells you that when you're looking at the DNA stuff, it's the 19, the biologics revolution, 1960s to 1970s.
[03:08:57.231 --> 03:09:08.116]  When we look at the future strategic warfare document of his from 2001, you notice you see DARPA, the CIA, the Office of Naval Intelligence.
[03:09:08.356 --> 03:09:12.738]  They tell you that none of this stuff is pixie dust.
[03:09:13.018 --> 03:09:15.679]  2025 welcomes use to the bots, borgs, and humans.
[03:09:16.380 --> 03:09:16.640]  Really?
[03:09:17.461 --> 03:09:17.781]  Really?
[03:09:18.681 --> 03:09:19.882]  And look, think about it.
[03:09:20.462 --> 03:09:28.425]  The chat GPT 4.0 hello launch, that is like the iteration of an AI bot.
[03:09:28.865 --> 03:09:33.987]  And wait till they combine that with anything that is robotic or biomimetic.
[03:09:34.787 --> 03:09:40.169]  We're already going to see it in the virtual universe much closer than people think.
[03:09:40.209 --> 03:09:40.909]  When we come back,
[03:09:42.003 --> 03:09:44.726]  We got a bunch of different videos to show you.
[03:09:44.746 --> 03:09:49.651]  We're going to also show you Google and NASA's partnership in the quantum computing arena.
[03:09:50.291 --> 03:09:54.936]  But we're going to hit this Roth Blacklip so you can again understand how all of these things.
[03:09:55.717 --> 03:10:11.636]  From biomedics to xenotransplantation to really the usurpation of our species, not only transhumanist, but unfortunately a posthumanist future has been laid out by these madmen and women
[03:10:12.276 --> 03:10:14.058]  Folks, remember to support the broadcast.
[03:10:14.158 --> 03:10:16.300]  Great news about InfoWars.
[03:10:16.360 --> 03:10:17.361]  I'm kind of taking it back.
[03:10:18.041 --> 03:10:31.534]  It shows you that good and evil exist and good can pull through and you can help them pull through by going to InfoWarsStore.com, getting the books, getting the supplements, sharing the links, telling people about Banned.Video, and supporting Alex Jones.
[03:10:31.954 --> 03:10:33.395]  Hey, I got some good news for everybody.
[03:10:33.895 --> 03:10:39.397]  A lot of products not available at InfoWarsTore.com are available at DrJonesNaturals.com.
[03:10:39.417 --> 03:10:40.018]  Just one word.
[03:10:40.358 --> 03:10:42.099]  DrJonesNaturals.com.
[03:10:42.479 --> 03:10:43.339]  We'll put that on screen.
[03:10:43.399 --> 03:10:44.800]  DrJonesNaturals.com.
[03:10:45.360 --> 03:10:47.181]  Dozens and dozens of silver products.
[03:10:47.481 --> 03:10:52.283]  That original super silver toothpaste with the iodine, the nano silver, the tea tree oil.
[03:10:52.583 --> 03:10:53.884]  This is the most incredible toothpaste ever.
[03:10:54.284 --> 03:10:55.785]  It's exclusively available
[03:10:56.704 --> 03:11:05.165]  at DrJonesNaturals.com and so many other products you can't get at MFOMoreStore.com or available at DrJonesNaturals.com.
[03:11:05.366 --> 03:11:06.526]  A lot of people.
[03:11:06.566 --> 03:11:09.546]  We've gotten so many calls and emails wanting this toothpaste.
[03:11:09.886 --> 03:11:10.786]  He's produced it again.
[03:11:10.846 --> 03:11:11.587]  It's available again.
[03:11:11.607 --> 03:11:15.447]  A limited run at DrJonesNaturals.com.
[03:11:16.747 --> 03:11:19.128]  And there's so many other great products there on the site.
[03:11:19.688 --> 03:11:21.068]  Be sure and check it out.
[03:11:21.088 --> 03:11:23.729]  There's a lot of products available there that are available at MFOMoreStore.com.
[03:11:23.949 --> 03:11:25.089]  A lot of products that aren't available
[03:11:26.408 --> 03:11:26.928]  And we are back.
[03:11:26.968 --> 03:11:29.490]  It's the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:11:29.510 --> 03:11:32.132]  I am Jason Bermas.
[03:11:37.702 --> 03:11:52.153]  So we've been talking transhumanism, we've talked xenotransplantation, we've talked NASA, and in particular we've talked somebody that's really a guru surrounding all of those movements in one, Martine Rothblatt.
[03:11:52.173 --> 03:12:01.420]  Now I'm going to play as much of this as I can stomach so you can really get a little bio on what Rothblatt is out there promoting.
[03:12:01.500 --> 03:12:04.903]  So let's do it and let's hit that click.
[03:12:08.901 --> 03:12:11.443]  What she sees, she achieves.
[03:12:12.343 --> 03:12:14.124]  An unimaginable legacy.
[03:12:16.766 --> 03:12:21.248]  Founder of Sirius XM, bringing satellite radio to the world.
[03:12:22.769 --> 03:12:25.891]  Founder of United Therapeutics, finding a cure.
[03:12:26.711 --> 03:12:30.093]  Saving her daughters and thousands of others lives.
[03:12:31.232 --> 03:12:42.957]  Martin Rothblatt may not be the world's most famous person, but she is without a doubt the most extraordinary and significant that I know.
[03:12:43.317 --> 03:12:45.998]  When Martin believes in something, nothing can stop her.
[03:12:46.438 --> 03:12:47.899]  Martín is very unique.
[03:12:48.119 --> 03:12:49.559]  Her vision is infectious.
[03:12:49.999 --> 03:12:52.981]  I first became fascinated with aviation during college.
[03:12:53.461 --> 03:13:00.203]  It's amazing that as people who are born on the ground, we can use our intelligence to figure out how to fly.
[03:13:00.584 --> 03:13:06.746]  But the first time I was able to actually pilot a plane, a Cessna 152, it was an exalting experience.
[03:13:07.066 --> 03:13:09.647]  Martín's passion for aviation in space led to
[03:13:11.729 --> 03:13:20.660]  I began to learn about the beginnings of satellite communication and that in turn led to my undergraduate thesis.
[03:13:21.241 --> 03:13:27.769]  I thought to myself, wow, with satellite communications you could create a nervous system for humanity.
[03:13:28.369 --> 03:13:33.471]  More than any other individual, Martine is responsible for creating the satellite radio industry.
[03:13:33.651 --> 03:13:38.633]  When you think about satellites and satellite communications, you think of Martine Morel-Klatt.
[03:13:38.653 --> 03:13:40.374]  Let me just stop.
[03:13:40.534 --> 03:13:50.418]  I mean, again, when you think about satellites and satellite communication, talking about this virtual communication global network, right?
[03:13:52.699 --> 03:13:59.564]  Artificial skin that NASA talks about that's really being implemented via Starlink and other programs.
[03:14:00.265 --> 03:14:03.687]  This is a person that's essential in these things.
[03:14:03.707 --> 03:14:05.889]  You just saw Ross Perot Jr.
[03:14:06.509 --> 03:14:07.650]  talking Rothblatt up.
[03:14:08.741 --> 03:14:10.782]  She did amazing work for NASA.
[03:14:10.822 --> 03:14:22.605]  She negotiated international treaties and was responsible for obtaining worldwide approval of spectrum allocations for space-based navigation services and direct-to-person satellite radio transmissions.
[03:14:22.925 --> 03:14:30.747]  As an entrepreneur, she helped launch and lead multiple satellite communication companies, including Geostar and, of course, SiriusXM.
[03:14:32.109 --> 03:14:42.576]  Satellite radio was the innovation that provided GA pilots with near real-time weather so they could make safe, tactical, and strategic weather decisions in flight.
[03:14:43.857 --> 03:14:46.239]  But nothing meant more to Martine than her family.
[03:14:46.999 --> 03:14:53.884]  So when her daughter Genesis was diagnosed with the fatal disease pulmonary arterial hypertension, her world stopped.
[03:14:54.927 --> 03:14:58.631]  Genesis was diagnosed at a young age of six years old.
[03:14:58.891 --> 03:15:05.217]  And when the doctors told us that she was going to die within three to five years, we were devastated.
[03:15:05.577 --> 03:15:11.243]  But we pulled ourselves up off the floor and said, we're not going to accept this diagnosis.
[03:15:11.443 --> 03:15:12.845]  We're going to do something about it.
[03:15:13.345 --> 03:15:18.210]  And so Martine dedicated herself to saving her daughter's life the only way she knew how.
[03:15:18.850 --> 03:15:28.395]  Martina's not a physician, she's not a research scientist, and she has no medical training, but she dedicated herself and commit herself to saving her daughter's life.
[03:15:29.415 --> 03:15:40.481]  But certainly a thought leader, you know that term, a thought leader, with things like this, again, not a scientist, none of these things, but still at the forefront of all these.
[03:15:40.521 --> 03:15:44.863]  And look, I'm not trying to degrade the fact
[03:15:45.956 --> 03:15:54.277]  That Ben Martin, and into Martin's daughter, needed some kind of treatment and that this was necessarily a bad thing.
[03:15:54.317 --> 03:15:55.638]  But look where it's going.
[03:15:56.078 --> 03:15:58.578]  And look what's being promoted by this person.
[03:15:58.818 --> 03:16:01.919]  And look how they're being promoted right now.
[03:16:02.679 --> 03:16:05.119]  This is that Bernaysian gloss.
[03:16:05.759 --> 03:16:09.960]  These propaganda methods, the PR mechanics.
[03:16:10.640 --> 03:16:14.521]  Okay, and with that being said, I want to show you something from NASA.
[03:16:15.369 --> 03:16:16.610]  That's about all I could take from it.
[03:16:16.690 --> 03:16:20.212]  You know, we were about to get... We've already covered the United Therapeutics stuff.
[03:16:21.333 --> 03:16:22.914]  You get the gist, okay?
[03:16:23.775 --> 03:16:26.876]  NASA, they're con... We're going to the moon!
[03:16:27.057 --> 03:16:27.697]  Artemis!
[03:16:28.337 --> 03:16:29.658]  We're going to Mars!
[03:16:29.718 --> 03:16:30.739]  Give me a... No, we're not.
[03:16:31.488 --> 03:16:36.634]  That's ridiculous, especially not with rocket technology or in any kind of a public mission.
[03:16:36.674 --> 03:16:37.054]  I'm sorry.
[03:16:37.074 --> 03:16:37.996]  It's just not reality.
[03:16:38.376 --> 03:16:41.279]  What we are doing is we are weaponizing space.
[03:16:41.660 --> 03:16:46.085]  We are putting that artificial skin or network around the world.
[03:16:46.105 --> 03:16:52.292]  We're doing experimentation in low Earth orbit and elsewhere, but we're also selling the public
[03:16:52.990 --> 03:16:56.473]  On that vision, right, that cartoon Hollyweird image.
[03:16:56.953 --> 03:17:03.618]  And I want to show everybody, this is like a minute and a half, and it shows how ridiculous NASA is.
[03:17:03.658 --> 03:17:08.782]  This is their gateway deep space, like, launch theme park.
[03:17:08.802 --> 03:17:10.003]  It's like Disneyland.
[03:17:10.423 --> 03:17:12.024]  This is what sells you on everything.
[03:17:12.384 --> 03:17:14.386]  And every time I look at it, I laugh.
[03:17:14.826 --> 03:17:20.050]  Then what we're going to do is we're actually going to play a video from about a decade ago.
[03:17:21.002 --> 03:17:26.545]  On Google partnering with NASA, talking about the multiverse.
[03:17:26.885 --> 03:17:27.165]  All right.
[03:17:27.205 --> 03:17:29.607]  And really, that's going to work us into the metaverse.
[03:17:29.647 --> 03:17:30.947]  It's all virtual to me.
[03:17:31.107 --> 03:17:32.088]  It's all Johnny nonsense.
[03:17:32.348 --> 03:17:35.190]  I do believe we're in base reality right here.
[03:17:35.230 --> 03:17:36.310]  So they're selling you on a lie.
[03:17:37.031 --> 03:17:45.195]  And really that intertwining of the military industrial complex, because look, it's not just, you know, people need to read this entire document.
[03:17:45.615 --> 03:17:49.237]  But when you see that, they tell you there's no pixie dust and that what?
[03:17:50.320 --> 03:17:52.762]  We've already taken over evolution.
[03:17:52.942 --> 03:17:54.022]  It's called directed evolution.
[03:17:54.082 --> 03:17:55.143]  Let me move my shoulders.
[03:17:55.403 --> 03:17:58.905]  Above that, cross-species molecular breeding, right?
[03:17:58.945 --> 03:18:03.608]  They rightfully predicted the bio-nano era all the way back in 2001, beginning in 2020.
[03:18:03.888 --> 03:18:11.632]  They started injecting billions of people with bio-nano technology via mRNA at that point.
[03:18:12.242 --> 03:18:15.904]  And if you read what the virtual universe is, okay?
[03:18:16.985 --> 03:18:18.666]  I mean, that's a wrap!
[03:18:19.106 --> 03:18:21.388]  Well, you know, let's go to some of these bio ones right here.
[03:18:21.408 --> 03:18:22.068]  If you look at this.
[03:18:22.668 --> 03:18:25.390]  Synthetic Bio Crispo Personalized Medicine.
[03:18:26.131 --> 03:18:27.932]  They always sell you on the anti-aging.
[03:18:28.312 --> 03:18:29.733]  Notice the Internet of Things is here.
[03:18:29.853 --> 03:18:30.874]  Smart Everything.
[03:18:31.694 --> 03:18:32.174]  AI.
[03:18:32.294 --> 03:18:32.955]  Writ Large.
[03:18:33.135 --> 03:18:34.296]  Autonomous Robots.
[03:18:35.056 --> 03:18:36.177]  Brain Machines.
[03:18:36.597 --> 03:18:37.598]  Virtual Presence.
[03:18:37.718 --> 03:18:38.258]  VR.
[03:18:38.398 --> 03:18:39.779]  Holographic Projection.
[03:18:40.199 --> 03:18:41.240]  Digital Reality.
[03:18:42.108 --> 03:18:42.689]  All right here.
[03:18:43.410 --> 03:18:49.541]  So again, while NASA sells you on the moon and Mars, that's the real reality.
[03:18:49.561 --> 03:18:50.603]  But we'll get into that in a second.
[03:18:50.883 --> 03:18:52.286]  This is what they're selling you on.
[03:19:08.364 --> 03:19:09.325]  Ooh, it's so exciting!
[03:19:09.345 --> 03:19:11.165]  See, they've got big screens!
[03:19:12.125 --> 03:19:13.386]  And graphics!
[03:19:13.406 --> 03:19:14.326]  Wow!
[03:19:14.466 --> 03:19:18.648]  And I can see models of stuff hanging!
[03:19:18.808 --> 03:19:21.609]  Looks like a Disney theme park.
[03:19:21.689 --> 03:19:24.050]  Like exhibit.
[03:19:24.090 --> 03:19:30.112]  Oh, you're gonna sit there like a video game!
[03:19:30.192 --> 03:19:31.752]  The Boeing Starliner, SpaceX.
[03:19:32.372 --> 03:19:33.773]  Two of the biggest contracts.
[03:19:36.780 --> 03:19:37.820]  And the D.O.D.
[03:19:38.060 --> 03:19:44.242]  And like they even show you, you're basically gonna go on a roller coaster.
[03:19:44.322 --> 03:19:44.642]  Oh boy!
[03:19:44.662 --> 03:19:45.883]  It's all like virtual.
[03:19:45.943 --> 03:19:48.503]  They didn't even have the ride built at the time.
[03:19:49.103 --> 03:19:51.904]  Not even like name one graphics.
[03:19:52.164 --> 03:19:54.945]  This is a few years old for sure.
[03:19:55.065 --> 03:19:58.386]  But again, they're selling you a fantasy world.
[03:19:58.466 --> 03:19:59.546]  Alright?
[03:19:59.786 --> 03:20:01.387]  And in this next clip...
[03:20:05.035 --> 03:20:12.242]  Not the gateway fantasy, but the kind of work they're actually doing, but how they're trying to sell you on that work, right?
[03:20:12.262 --> 03:20:15.785]  I'm almost, you know, in fact, I'm going to.
[03:20:16.165 --> 03:20:21.890]  I'm going to play this first to show people, because I talked about the virtual universe quickly.
[03:20:22.370 --> 03:20:25.213]  And to me, again, the metaverse and the multiverse are the same thing.
[03:20:25.293 --> 03:20:26.174]  I don't think they're real.
[03:20:27.057 --> 03:20:27.317]  Right?
[03:20:27.858 --> 03:20:39.104]  And they want to separate you, not only from your biological reality, but your spiritual reality here on this planet, in this realm, in this dimension.
[03:20:39.845 --> 03:20:40.225]  Okay?
[03:20:40.665 --> 03:20:46.949]  So, let's just do this, take that off, and we're going to go to this.
[03:20:47.089 --> 03:20:49.951]  This is a WEF video, actually.
[03:20:49.971 --> 03:20:50.851]  Okay?
[03:20:50.871 --> 03:20:52.232]  And I want everybody to check this out.
[03:20:52.252 --> 03:20:53.133]  I'm going to get out of the way.
[03:20:54.726 --> 03:20:55.647]  Put the volume back on.
[03:20:55.667 --> 03:20:59.169]  But what you're seeing, this is a commercially available device already.
[03:20:59.550 --> 03:21:03.472]  This VR device lets you feel the metaverse with your bare hands.
[03:21:04.033 --> 03:21:07.055]  So they already have touch, taste, and smell.
[03:21:07.475 --> 03:21:08.095]  Alright?
[03:21:08.115 --> 03:21:10.137]  They're just not telling you about a lot of this.
[03:21:11.438 --> 03:21:13.739]  And this is haptic feedback.
[03:21:13.959 --> 03:21:14.940]  Alright?
[03:21:15.520 --> 03:21:20.364]  Imagine being in a room of this with the ultrasonic force field in the air.
[03:21:21.804 --> 03:21:24.426]  Creating these waves of touch.
[03:21:25.186 --> 03:21:25.846]  Okay?
[03:21:27.147 --> 03:21:31.569]  And, you know, Alex was just playing that video of the kid using this.
[03:21:33.910 --> 03:21:36.571]  So, these are first vector haptics.
[03:21:36.671 --> 03:21:40.073]  It's not even that you have to wear the suit.
[03:21:40.653 --> 03:21:44.435]  See, it's a mid-air force field wherever your arms can reach.
[03:21:45.595 --> 03:21:47.156]  You can, it's called a merge.
[03:21:47.536 --> 03:21:49.757]  Now it's, again, already available.
[03:21:50.467 --> 03:21:52.570]  This technology's only gotten better.
[03:21:53.130 --> 03:22:03.302]  It's discussed in the documentation where, listen, they also talk about, what, cross-molecular species breeding in this Bushnell document here.
[03:22:03.923 --> 03:22:06.345]  Now, you think I'm crazy.
[03:22:06.405 --> 03:22:11.131]  I mean, first of all, let's go to the nano thing because that's everywhere in this, but
[03:22:12.249 --> 03:22:13.471]  That's the neocortex.
[03:22:13.511 --> 03:22:15.834]  He tells it how it's already in the food supplies.
[03:22:15.874 --> 03:22:18.297]  By the way, right there, that's nano implants.
[03:22:18.497 --> 03:22:20.539]  Immune boosting nano implants.
[03:22:21.300 --> 03:22:21.620]  There it is.
[03:22:22.041 --> 03:22:28.228]  Genomically altered bioproducts are common for food, fodder, and other uses.
[03:22:29.229 --> 03:22:29.550]  See that?
[03:22:30.470 --> 03:22:37.494]  As part of the evolution of humans, the biorevolution has enabled significant increases from year to year in life expectancy.
[03:22:37.574 --> 03:22:38.374]  Actually, not true.
[03:22:38.954 --> 03:22:42.756]  They're telling you they're going to be immune boosting, these nano implants.
[03:22:43.197 --> 03:22:45.378]  The complete opposite is true.
[03:22:45.398 --> 03:22:46.738]  Okay?
[03:22:46.838 --> 03:22:48.459]  It's the inverse of reality.
[03:22:49.080 --> 03:22:53.062]  As this technology is literally foisted upon us.
[03:22:53.822 --> 03:22:55.003]  So, let's play.
[03:22:55.843 --> 03:22:57.864]  This is the Google-NASA partnership.
[03:22:57.904 --> 03:22:58.244]  And you know what?
[03:22:58.264 --> 03:22:59.405]  We're going to do this one live.
[03:23:00.331 --> 03:23:06.536]  Because Google and NASA claim quantum supremacy.
[03:23:07.457 --> 03:23:14.003]  And you notice we're hearing a lot about AI and not much about quantum computing anymore.
[03:23:14.023 --> 03:23:19.747]  Do you think they gave up their quest for quantum supremacy that they announced now five years ago?
[03:23:20.868 --> 03:23:21.629]  Think that's a thing?
[03:23:22.170 --> 03:23:23.791]  Or you think they've been pushing forward
[03:23:24.767 --> 03:23:25.528]  I mean, give me a break.
[03:23:25.548 --> 03:23:32.412]  But again, let's play the clip where they sell you on this idea of a multiverse.
[03:23:33.052 --> 03:23:36.695]  And here's the problem with the multiverse, everybody.
[03:23:36.755 --> 03:23:41.218]  Once you have a quote-unquote multiverse, then
[03:23:43.351 --> 03:23:47.612]  Essentially, you don't have free will because everything is supposedly taking place.
[03:23:47.673 --> 03:23:51.594]  Somewhere, Jason Burmess would be the emperor of the world.
[03:23:52.374 --> 03:23:58.896]  Somewhere else, I would be a hobo and a bum or a serial killer or the worst of the worst, the best of the best.
[03:23:58.976 --> 03:23:59.817]  I just don't buy it.
[03:24:01.197 --> 03:24:04.058]  I buy into the belief of free will and possibility.
[03:24:05.262 --> 03:24:18.766]  I also buy into probabilities, but the ability of human beings to make those decisions and overcome the obstacles of improbabilities, all the power of thought, action, will, those are real things.
[03:24:20.046 --> 03:24:24.827]  But I think they're selling you on the complete opposite of this via this technology.
[03:24:25.427 --> 03:24:26.508]  But you decide for yourself.
[03:24:26.648 --> 03:24:31.709]  This is Google and NASA and their quantum and artificial intelligence facility.
[03:24:33.530 --> 03:24:38.954]  Who was it that said, if you think you understand quantum physics, you don't understand quantum physics?
[03:24:43.037 --> 03:24:43.718]  Consciousness.
[03:24:43.938 --> 03:24:44.578]  Intelligence.
[03:24:44.718 --> 03:24:45.319]  Free will.
[03:24:45.539 --> 03:24:46.320]  Determinism.
[03:24:46.420 --> 03:24:47.040]  Black holes.
[03:24:47.120 --> 03:24:48.841]  Protecting the planet from asteroids.
[03:24:48.962 --> 03:24:50.723]  High-Zone Viscosity Anticlinical.
[03:24:50.903 --> 03:24:51.283]  Atoms.
[03:24:51.463 --> 03:24:52.324]  Ion traps.
[03:24:52.424 --> 03:24:53.665]  Nuclear magnetic resonance.
[03:24:53.885 --> 03:24:54.886]  Superconductors.
[03:24:54.966 --> 03:24:55.687]  Photons.
[03:24:55.807 --> 03:24:56.867]  Artificial intelligence.
[03:24:56.908 --> 03:24:57.688]  Machine learning.
[03:24:57.708 --> 03:24:58.909]  Past and future.
[03:24:58.949 --> 03:25:00.090]  Classical physics.
[03:25:00.270 --> 03:25:00.951]  Time travel.
[03:25:01.071 --> 03:25:02.732]  I mean, the whole thing.
[03:25:04.255 --> 03:25:09.037]  I can tell it's gonna get very hot as I start speaking, so tell me if I start to look really shiny.
[03:25:10.777 --> 03:25:15.779]  Quantum physics puts everything into question.
[03:25:15.979 --> 03:25:19.020]  It defies every intuition you have about the natural world.
[03:25:19.660 --> 03:25:22.541]  Quantum is a very strange regime of physics.
[03:25:22.661 --> 03:25:29.563]  Things can exist in this state of superposition where they can be like ghosting on each other, where they can be this and that at the same time.
[03:25:30.123 --> 03:25:30.824]  Entanglement.
[03:25:30.944 --> 03:25:32.084]  Quantum entanglement.
[03:25:32.164 --> 03:25:35.545]  Two objects, if they're quantum mechanically entangled, are still
[03:25:37.930 --> 03:25:40.191]  Even though they can be a vast distance apart.
[03:25:40.451 --> 03:25:42.692]  The notion of the multiverse.
[03:25:43.032 --> 03:25:51.816]  There's a whole family of heart moves in different states and going through different experiences and different life trajectories.
[03:25:51.996 --> 03:25:53.696]  The famous one is quantum tunneling.
[03:25:53.876 --> 03:25:54.397]  Tunneling.
[03:25:54.517 --> 03:25:55.037]  Tunneling.
[03:25:55.137 --> 03:25:57.698]  Tunneling is the slippage between universes.
[03:25:58.418 --> 03:26:02.440]  For a long time people thought those effects only existed in the microscopic domain.
[03:26:02.680 --> 03:26:05.061]  Like atoms, electrons, photons.
[03:26:05.998 --> 03:26:09.000]  But really, it's the theory of our universe.
[03:26:09.280 --> 03:26:15.763]  So if you want to build a quantum computer, you want to incorporate those new phenomenon into information processing.
[03:26:15.803 --> 03:26:21.146]  Maybe quantum computation is one of those instruments that's going to allow us to see quantum effects at the human scale.
[03:26:22.007 --> 03:26:26.249]  Google and NASA have teamed up to share one of the world's first commercial quantum computers.
[03:26:26.609 --> 03:26:31.612]  This machine, made by Canada's D-Wave, will be installed in a NASA research center in California.
[03:26:32.199 --> 03:26:37.282]  So again, here's the music, the partnership, the public-private partnership.
[03:26:37.302 --> 03:26:41.984]  They're going to find the nature of reality with investment from Goldman Sachs!
[03:26:43.992 --> 03:26:45.893]  And all the usual suspects.
[03:26:45.913 --> 03:26:48.174]  This video is like a decade plus old.
[03:26:48.914 --> 03:26:53.716]  Quantum annealing, D-Wave systems, they're pretty antiquated at this point.
[03:26:53.736 --> 03:26:56.037]  There's a lot of other methods out there.
[03:26:56.317 --> 03:26:58.358]  In a future video, I'll probably be going over that.
[03:26:58.878 --> 03:27:00.559]  But let's get into it.
[03:27:00.599 --> 03:27:02.579]  We're going to get into the multiverse.
[03:27:12.037 --> 03:27:13.237]  The serene music.
[03:27:14.017 --> 03:27:14.878]  Ah, D-Waves.
[03:27:16.158 --> 03:27:25.740]  Built like the god in 2001 A Space Odyssey.
[03:27:25.820 --> 03:27:29.561]  This is the inside of one of our dilution refrigerators.
[03:27:30.281 --> 03:27:37.003]  All of this infrastructure is to basically operate the chip at a temperature that's two orders of magnitude colder than interstellar space.
[03:27:40.409 --> 03:27:50.496]  The processor is a quantum computer.
[03:27:50.556 --> 03:27:54.878]  It uses things called qubits as well as being either one or zero.
[03:27:55.019 --> 03:27:57.660]  Qubits can also be both at the same time.
[03:27:57.680 --> 03:28:04.505]  That will bring about a quantum leap in terms of power.
[03:28:04.645 --> 03:28:07.507]  Harnessing principles of reality that are
[03:28:08.542 --> 03:28:19.209]  Up until very recently, completely not observable by us is just fascinating in ways that I can't completely articulate.
[03:28:19.489 --> 03:28:25.774]  The overwhelmingly obvious killer app for quantum computation is optimization.
[03:28:26.014 --> 03:28:29.336]  Optimization problems are extremely difficult problems.
[03:28:29.356 --> 03:28:30.577]  Let me just stop it.
[03:28:31.118 --> 03:28:34.379]  Now, the gentleman before, the one that was talking about that, that was Geordi Rose.
[03:28:35.139 --> 03:28:37.580]  That is another transhumanist.
[03:28:37.600 --> 03:28:44.642]  That is another person that is pushing digital twins, uploading your consciousness, etc.
[03:28:44.702 --> 03:28:53.785]  And he's a large proponent, you can watch an entire lecture by him, that the multiverse not only is real, but they've tapped into it.
[03:28:54.585 --> 03:28:55.065]  I mean, again,
[03:28:55.794 --> 03:28:56.215]  I don't know.
[03:28:56.235 --> 03:28:56.835]  I'm not there.
[03:28:57.416 --> 03:28:58.937]  But I'm not buying it.
[03:28:59.718 --> 03:29:09.628]  All Google server centers together will not be capable of coming up with the best solution to these optimization problems as they get larger.
[03:29:10.288 --> 03:29:11.950]  So now what is an optimization problem?
[03:29:12.110 --> 03:29:13.211]  I'll give you an example.
[03:29:13.251 --> 03:29:17.153]  You want to do a trip through South America and you want to visit a number of cities.
[03:29:17.693 --> 03:29:22.756]  And then you ask, what is the cheapest ticket I can get to visit, let's say, 20 cities?
[03:29:22.776 --> 03:29:26.639]  And you can, of course, different routes and different airlines.
[03:29:27.239 --> 03:29:33.583]  And sort of imagine I list all the different options I have for my different routes to travel to these cities.
[03:29:33.943 --> 03:29:37.445]  We currently, as a civilization, we generate vast amounts of data.
[03:29:37.825 --> 03:29:41.728]  It could be climate data, genomic data, but it's very difficult
[03:29:42.849 --> 03:29:47.412]  Now let's just stop.
[03:29:47.452 --> 03:29:48.153]  You notice, right?
[03:29:48.233 --> 03:29:49.714]  Climate and genomics.
[03:29:50.315 --> 03:29:54.979]  And actually, if you go to that NASA document, there's a lot of climate in there.
[03:29:55.059 --> 03:29:56.460]  We've actually talked about this before.
[03:29:56.500 --> 03:29:59.182]  You notice how all these things intersect.
[03:29:59.202 --> 03:30:01.664]  In fact, on the same exact... I didn't even... I did a search.
[03:30:02.024 --> 03:30:04.066]  On the same exact...
[03:30:04.577 --> 03:30:09.898]  If you can solve optimization problems better, you have an important resource at your hand.
[03:30:09.918 --> 03:30:11.679]  I think at least it teaches us that we should be
[03:30:33.803 --> 03:30:36.705]  I can't ask it how long I'll live or the meaning of life.
[03:30:55.291 --> 03:30:59.654]  Really, we don't know what the best questions are to ask that computer.
[03:30:59.694 --> 03:31:02.296]  That's exactly what we're trying to understand now.
[03:31:02.496 --> 03:31:05.698]  To me, the most important question is, are we alone?
[03:31:06.399 --> 03:31:13.143]  And I have a feeling that quantum computers, as they mature, are going to help us answer that question.
[03:31:13.223 --> 03:31:21.048]  This is, of course, a more long-term research endeavor, and there are still tremendous obstacles and big questions.
[03:31:21.369 --> 03:31:23.290]  Some of those will be addressed in D-Wave.
[03:31:25.103 --> 03:31:30.146]  Some will be addressed at NASA and some at Google.
[03:31:30.246 --> 03:31:37.809]  I wasn't sure I would be able to experiment with a quantum computational device in my lifetime and now I'm confident that I will be able to.
[03:31:39.470 --> 03:31:50.336]  How amazing it is that we with our monkey heritage and monkey brains and monkey fingers have somehow lucked into a brain that allows us to
[03:31:51.796 --> 03:31:57.260]  Ask legitimate questions about the nature of physical reality.
[03:31:57.300 --> 03:31:58.120]  That's so cool!
[03:31:59.961 --> 03:32:03.764]  It's that human risk to go forth into that unknown frontier.
[03:32:05.004 --> 03:32:10.848]  Whether it's space exploration or quantum exploration, we do it because we must.
[03:32:13.069 --> 03:32:15.791]  We do it because that's what it means to be human.
[03:32:15.971 --> 03:32:16.952]  You notice they...
[03:32:18.323 --> 03:32:22.551]  Intersect what it means to be human with this idea that we evolved from monkeys.
[03:32:22.571 --> 03:32:27.801]  I don't think we have a monkey brain or a monkey mind and we don't think we lucked into anything.
[03:32:28.702 --> 03:32:30.366]  You know, I think that we are
[03:32:31.465 --> 03:32:34.648]  A product of intelligent design.
[03:32:34.728 --> 03:32:37.430]  I think that good and evil exist.
[03:32:37.490 --> 03:32:46.737]  I think that the science that we now know shows us that our senses can only observe so much, in fact, what we see.
[03:32:46.757 --> 03:32:54.664]  You know, I know that the Terrence Howard, Joe Rogan podcast is going super viral at this moment.
[03:32:55.104 --> 03:33:11.256]  And, you know, I watched it, and I'm not going to say that I necessarily agree with everything that Terrence Howard put out there or that I understand it, but I'll guarantee that, you know, it wasn't 100% wrong either.
[03:33:11.296 --> 03:33:13.037]  And what is the nature of reality?
[03:33:13.057 --> 03:33:14.558]  Well, that's the question, right?
[03:33:15.405 --> 03:33:28.218]  But I think the answer is that we already know as human beings what we should gravitate towards, and that is the love and respect of other human beings, because that's all we really want.
[03:33:28.839 --> 03:33:30.120]  We all want to live in peace.
[03:33:30.140 --> 03:33:31.962]  We want to be with our families.
[03:33:32.002 --> 03:33:33.223]  We want to enjoy life.
[03:33:33.243 --> 03:33:35.226]  Of course, there's going to be imperfections.
[03:33:35.606 --> 03:33:36.867]  There's going to be conflict.
[03:33:37.127 --> 03:33:37.848]  We were built that way.
[03:33:39.227 --> 03:33:54.538]  In order to have that, we have to have that free will and they're selling us really everything against and they're trying to take that free will away on a microscopic level, just about in every arena that matters.
[03:33:54.618 --> 03:33:55.799]  And I really do mean that.
[03:33:55.839 --> 03:33:57.860]  I mean, they're doing that in medicine.
[03:33:58.461 --> 03:34:00.382]  They're doing it in the food supply.
[03:34:00.402 --> 03:34:02.704]  I mean, Alex earlier today nailed it.
[03:34:03.348 --> 03:34:10.191]  You know, when you look at Bayer and Monsantin and that merger, I want people to really feel the gravity of that.
[03:34:10.731 --> 03:34:24.398]  Bayer wanted to merge with Monsanto, a company at the time that was being successfully sued across the board for the cancer relationship to round up.
[03:34:25.138 --> 03:34:31.501]  Then you saw that report earlier in the program on glyphosate and infertility in men.
[03:34:32.487 --> 03:34:34.468]  You don't think it's destroyed by design?
[03:34:34.948 --> 03:34:54.015]  You don't think that people are using this GMO genetically modified organism technology now for decades in a plan to really try to not only regiment all human beings but shape what humanity will come and
[03:34:54.699 --> 03:35:13.719]  When you see what they want to do, they want to biologically live forever while they convince the masses we can somehow upload our consciousness, disengage from our biological reality, disengage from the reality that is before us, and dive into a virtual one for the rest of eternity.
[03:35:13.819 --> 03:35:14.280]  It's a lie.
[03:35:14.844 --> 03:35:15.965]  It's a lie, Kurzweil.
[03:35:16.385 --> 03:35:17.665]  It's a lie, Rothblatt.
[03:35:18.005 --> 03:35:19.026]  We're on to your tricks.
[03:35:19.566 --> 03:35:20.587]  We're hip to your game.
[03:35:21.067 --> 03:35:23.288]  Folks, I hope you enjoyed the broadcast.
[03:35:23.308 --> 03:35:26.349]  Remember to support Alex Jones and InfoWars.com.
[03:35:26.389 --> 03:35:32.832]  Again, great news that Alex is going to be able to continue to run this operation, especially
[03:35:33.312 --> 03:35:35.374]  In such an important election year.
[03:35:35.574 --> 03:35:38.076]  I do want to let everybody know I am a documentary filmmaker.
[03:35:38.316 --> 03:35:44.300]  Loose Change, Final Cut, Fabled Enemies, Invisible Empire, A New World Order, Define, and Shade the Motion Picture all free.
[03:35:44.320 --> 03:35:46.942]  You can catch me five days and nights a week.
[03:35:47.163 --> 03:35:49.104]  Got a daytime show at Patriot.tv.
[03:35:49.364 --> 03:35:52.186]  Got a nighttime show over at TNT Radio.
[03:35:52.486 --> 03:35:54.688]  To this guy, it is not about left or right.
[03:35:54.808 --> 03:35:56.690]  It is always about right and wrong.
[03:35:56.970 --> 03:35:58.691]  I absolutely love you guys.
[03:35:58.991 --> 03:36:02.374]  Support InfoWars.com and we will see you on the flip side.
[03:36:03.120 --> 03:36:04.762]  Let's go to Nurse Keith in Oregon.
[03:36:04.782 --> 03:36:05.303]  You're on the air.
[03:36:05.343 --> 03:36:06.245]  Welcome, and thanks for holding.
[03:36:06.605 --> 03:36:16.960]  About an hour ago, you were kind of explaining to people about how the micronutrients and stuff that are available in different foods actually have an effect on... Let's be clear.
[03:36:17.000 --> 03:36:19.464]  There isn't long-term, billion-year evolution.
[03:36:19.984 --> 03:36:23.126]  Not trying to brag, but I'm a board-certified wound care
[03:36:39.051 --> 03:36:43.013]  The average medical doctor gets two hours of college education on nutrition.
[03:36:43.033 --> 03:36:45.855]  So one of the things that I do is I'm looking for results
[03:37:09.154 --> 03:37:18.620]  And by using very good nutraceuticals and supplements and things like that, I can fix a problem.
[03:37:18.780 --> 03:37:26.224]  Just a real quick example, let's say you have a really bad wound on your leg and you have diabetes and poor circulation.
[03:37:26.324 --> 03:37:34.789]  Well, I can order you a bottle of Nitric Boost, a bottle of BezoBeat, and
[03:37:35.908 --> 03:37:37.651]  Get your ass up on a treadmill a little bit.
[03:37:38.112 --> 03:37:42.459]  And these things work better than any of the medication that we give.
[03:37:43.186 --> 03:37:48.309]  So I've got about 35,000 points because I gave these things away as gifts.
[03:37:48.650 --> 03:37:49.230]  Hold on, hold on.
[03:37:49.270 --> 03:37:50.071]  This is important.
[03:37:50.111 --> 03:37:51.491]  This is important, absolutely.
[03:37:51.972 --> 03:37:54.754]  Just iodine alone, it's essential.
[03:37:54.774 --> 03:37:55.554]  It means you die without it.
[03:37:55.594 --> 03:37:57.135]  They don't tell you most people are deficient.
[03:37:57.455 --> 03:37:59.557]  Two billion people have cognitive disabilities, the UN admits.
[03:37:59.777 --> 03:38:02.919]  That's what these concentrated plants and other compounds do.
[03:38:03.319 --> 03:38:05.901]  So you're saying you're taking care of people with wounds, one of the biggest
[03:38:06.301 --> 03:38:15.586]  Medical industries out there super tough job you're seeing with nutrition and also they need to not be sedentary obviously You're seeing massive effects because I've actually read about this.
[03:38:15.626 --> 03:38:26.092]  I'm not an expert like you but that there's massive problems Because the doctors don't even say exercise or get out of the bed or take supplements that are good for your skin And it's so simple.
[03:38:26.172 --> 03:38:31.875]  I mean my wife takes supplements to have good hair and good nails and it really works for her I mean this stuff works.
[03:38:31.955 --> 03:38:34.937]  It's the compounds tell people about some of the things you've witnessed and
[03:38:35.157 --> 03:38:41.384]  Alex, I would not have 35,000 Patriot Points if this stuff didn't work.
[03:38:41.504 --> 03:38:44.808]  I'm not into buying BS and I don't push BS.
[03:38:45.429 --> 03:38:50.795]  When I've got a complex wound and I see something that you guys sell that I know
[03:38:51.781 --> 03:38:56.786]  We can sell the stuff Walmart sells, synthetic stuff, and the bottle costs more than what they're selling.
[03:38:57.206 --> 03:39:01.490]  With us, these products, some of these products are costing us $30 a bottle, like DNA Force, okay?
[03:39:01.510 --> 03:39:04.172]  I mean, so there's cost because it is the highest rated.
[03:39:18.965 --> 03:39:26.450]  If you're taking a nitrate, like you were talking about the nitrate boost, boom, that is going to vasodilate.
[03:39:27.131 --> 03:39:31.574]  So when you're vasodilated, yeah, you're going to be pitching a proper ten.
[03:39:31.934 --> 03:39:33.555]  The vasobeat does the exact same thing.
[03:39:33.976 --> 03:39:37.198]  But it also helps if I've got a person who's got really poor perfusion.
[03:39:38.075 --> 03:39:44.258]  And I just want to get their blood flow going so that I can keep this wound from going septic and actually get some granulation going.
[03:39:44.779 --> 03:39:46.760]  Or I could throw all the medications at it.
[03:39:47.060 --> 03:39:48.160]  Not going to do a damn thing.
[03:39:48.521 --> 03:39:53.783]  The doctors see the patient for 10 minutes, write a prescription, say, okay, come back in 45 days.
[03:39:54.144 --> 03:39:56.005]  And it's my job to actually go figure it out.
[03:39:56.205 --> 03:39:58.746]  And so I use a lot of the stuff that you guys have.
[03:39:59.046 --> 03:40:00.907]  Thank you so much and God bless you, Nurse Keith.
[03:40:00.947 --> 03:40:01.567]  We'll talk to you soon.
[03:40:01.587 --> 03:40:02.088]  Give us a number.
