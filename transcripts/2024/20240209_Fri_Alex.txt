[00:00:07.352 --> 00:00:17.016]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you've got one!
[00:00:18.596 --> 00:00:24.078]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.300]  We're good to go.
[00:00:41.711 --> 00:00:43.093]  You're describing two different systems.
[00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:49.481]  You say the leader acts in the interest of the voters, but you also say these decisions are not made by the leader, they're made by the ruling classes.
[00:00:50.482 --> 00:00:54.007]  You've run this country for so long, you've known all these American presidents.
[00:00:54.087 --> 00:00:57.852]  What are those power centers in the United States, do you think?
[00:00:58.953 --> 00:01:00.215]  Like, who actually makes the decisions?
[00:01:05.346 --> 00:01:07.386]  I don't know.
[00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:10.367]  America is a complex country.
[00:01:10.407 --> 00:01:13.928]  Conservative on one hand, rapidly changing on the other.
[00:01:14.588 --> 00:01:16.509]  It's not easy for us to sort it all out.
[00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:19.890]  Who makes decisions in the elections?
[00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.571]  Is it possible to understand this when each state has its own legislation?
[00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:26.712]  Each state regulates itself?
[00:01:27.632 --> 00:01:30.673]  Someone can be excluded from elections at the state level.
[00:01:31.747 --> 00:01:33.869]  It is a two-stage electoral system.
[00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:37.031]  It is very difficult for us to understand it.
[00:01:38.092 --> 00:01:42.456]  Certainly, there are two parties that are dominant, the Republicans and the Democrats.
[00:01:43.356 --> 00:01:48.000]  And within this party system, the centers that make decisions, that prepare decisions.
[00:01:49.487 --> 00:02:00.951]  Then, look, why, in my opinion, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, this crude, completely unjustified policy of pressure was pursued against Russia?
[00:02:01.472 --> 00:02:03.812]  After all, this is a policy of pressure.
[00:02:04.753 --> 00:02:11.535]  NATO expansion, support for the separatists in Caucasus, creation of a missile defense system.
[00:02:11.975 --> 00:02:13.416]  These are all elements of pressure.
[00:02:14.156 --> 00:02:15.997]  Pressure, pressure, pressure.
[00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.120]  Then, dragging Ukraine into NATO is all about pressure, pressure, pressure.
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.502]  Why?
[00:02:25.765 --> 00:02:29.932]  I think among other things, because excessive production capacities were created.
[00:02:32.796 --> 00:02:41.562]  During the confrontation with the Soviet Union, there were many centers created and specialists on the Soviet Union who could not do anything else.
[00:02:42.062 --> 00:03:00.415]  They convinced the political leadership that it is necessary to continue chiseling Russia, to try to break it up, to create on this territory several quasi-state entities and to subdue them in a divided form, to use their combined potential for the future struggle with China.
[00:03:01.897 --> 00:03:07.720]  This is a mistake, including the excessive potential of those who worked for the confrontation with the Soviet Union.
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.941]  It is necessary to get rid of this.
[00:03:11.301 --> 00:03:17.524]  There should be new, fresh forces, people who look into the future and understand what is happening in the world.
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.001]  Look at how Indonesia is developing.
[00:03:21.021 --> 00:03:23.424]  600 million people.
[00:03:24.264 --> 00:03:25.546]  Where can we get away from that?
[00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:26.346]  Nowhere.
[00:03:27.047 --> 00:03:36.315]  We just have to assume that Indonesia will enter, it is already in, the club of the world's leading economies, no matter who likes it or dislikes it.
[00:03:37.937 --> 00:03:43.142]  Yes, we understand and are aware that in the United States, despite all the economic problems,
[00:03:44.997 --> 00:03:48.821]  The situation is still normal, with the economy growing decently.
[00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:53.245]  The GDP is growing by 2.5%, if I'm not mistaken.
[00:03:55.387 --> 00:04:00.492]  But if we want to ensure the future, then we need to change our approach to what is changing.
[00:04:01.193 --> 00:04:07.199]  As I already said, the world would nevertheless change, regardless of how the developments in Ukraine end.
[00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:09.100]  The world is changing.
[00:04:10.188 --> 00:04:17.791]  In the United States themselves, experts are writing that the United States are nonetheless gradually changing their position in the world.
[00:04:18.332 --> 00:04:20.052]  It is your experts who write that.
[00:04:20.452 --> 00:04:21.213]  I just read them.
[00:04:22.433 --> 00:04:27.836]  The only question is how this would happen, painfully and quickly, or gently and gradually.
[00:04:28.916 --> 00:04:32.017]  And this is written by people who are not anti-American.
[00:04:32.418 --> 00:04:34.959]  They simply follow global development trends.
[00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.639]  That's it.
[00:04:38.112 --> 00:04:48.480]  And in order to assess them and change policies, we need people who think, look forward, can analyze and recommend certain decisions at the level of political leaders.
[00:05:01.052 --> 00:05:02.893]  But folks, we're standing up for our rights.
[00:05:02.913 --> 00:05:03.994]  We're standing up for your rights.
[00:05:04.034 --> 00:05:06.416]  We're standing up for all of our freedoms and our children.
[00:05:06.636 --> 00:05:14.282]  If you don't spread the word about the broadcast, if you don't share the links, if you don't buy products at InfoWarsStore.com, then I'm not griping at you.
[00:05:14.302 --> 00:05:15.423]  I'm just saying, what are you doing?
[00:05:16.504 --> 00:05:19.767]  Less than 1% of you ever buy a product at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:27.653]  If just a half a percent more would go buy a book or a film or a t-shirt or get some of our great supplements and then reorder them because they really work.
[00:05:27.993 --> 00:05:28.573]  Just try it.
[00:05:29.193 --> 00:05:31.134]  We would be able to do so many things.
[00:05:31.514 --> 00:05:35.256]  I'm praying to God that he'll touch your heart to decide to support us.
[00:05:35.797 --> 00:05:37.557]  Infowarsstore.com
[00:05:39.684 --> 00:05:40.364]  It's been sold out.
[00:05:40.404 --> 00:05:41.185]  It's back in stock.
[00:05:41.245 --> 00:05:42.445]  Reformulated even stronger.
[00:05:43.225 --> 00:05:45.106]  Nitric boost to clean out your blood and your whole body.
[00:05:45.566 --> 00:05:46.647]  Vasodilation.
[00:05:47.287 --> 00:05:49.028]  It's got a lot of wonderful side effects.
[00:05:49.048 --> 00:05:49.708]  And I mean good ones.
[00:05:49.728 --> 00:05:50.908]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:52.429]  It is powerful.
[00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:53.389]  So be careful with it.
[00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:54.890]  Next level foundational energy.
[00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.651]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:05:57.691 --> 00:05:59.512]  You are listening to an Infowars.com Frontline Report.
[00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:14.963]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:15.403 --> 00:06:21.749]  We now take you live.
[00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:30.657]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:32.906 --> 00:06:39.668]  This is the broadcast that the globalists do not want you to hear, but it's still on the air because of your dauntless support.
[00:06:39.808 --> 00:06:44.529]  I'm very honored and blessed to be here on this Friday, February 9th, 2024 transmission.
[00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:48.149]  And we are going to be here for the next four hours live.
[00:06:48.769 --> 00:06:54.011]  Annabelle and Troy are in the war room, also on the Infowars Network, coming up at 3 p.m.
[00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:55.271]  Central Texas time today.
[00:06:56.443 --> 00:06:59.464]  Okay, obviously the Biden story is ultra-massive.
[00:06:59.484 --> 00:07:01.785]  The wheels have totally come off on multiple levels.
[00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:03.665]  He doesn't even know what planet he's on.
[00:07:04.465 --> 00:07:07.266]  His brain is declining more in a week than it has in the last year.
[00:07:07.286 --> 00:07:10.327]  At current decline, he won't be able to talk in a few months.
[00:07:11.267 --> 00:07:12.808]  So this is just totally insane.
[00:07:13.348 --> 00:07:22.190]  But you notice he's getting worse right before the Democrat convention coming up because their doctors that are drugging him up are in control.
[00:07:22.571 --> 00:07:23.631]  This is a soft coup.
[00:07:24.721 --> 00:07:28.485]  And now mainstream media has the knives out, corporate media, to remove Biden.
[00:07:29.607 --> 00:07:31.930]  Incredible Putin interview yesterday.
[00:07:33.311 --> 00:07:38.037]  Very statesmanlike, extremely intellectual, very historical.
[00:07:38.657 --> 00:07:41.281]  But the main takeaway is, and what the globalists are jealous of him,
[00:07:42.415 --> 00:07:42.595]  I think?
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:07.405]  For 1,100 years, perpetual war from the East and West, and that's what's going on with the Russians.
[00:08:07.605 --> 00:08:08.586]  And they're not going to back down.
[00:08:08.606 --> 00:08:09.446]  They're not going to go away.
[00:08:10.067 --> 00:08:13.569]  And if the West starts a war with them, it'll be the end of civilizations.
[00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:13.930]  We know it.
[00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.690]  They'll die.
[00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:15.170]  We'll die.
[00:08:15.951 --> 00:08:20.794]  Much worse than the Germans and the Russians going toe-to-toe in World War II.
[00:08:20.814 --> 00:08:23.797]  And I'm not lessening how many trips we lost in World War II.
[00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:24.897]  Both my grandfathers were in it.
[00:08:24.917 --> 00:08:28.280]  But Russia and Germany were the big...
[00:08:29.605 --> 00:08:30.205]  We're good to go.
[00:08:55.327 --> 00:08:57.914]  And you have Napoleon losing against the Russians.
[00:08:58.395 --> 00:09:00.701]  It just goes on and on and on.
[00:09:02.816 --> 00:09:08.577]  And so, I predicted, and just to tell you, I know with my research, nobody else did.
[00:09:08.597 --> 00:09:09.637]  Everybody's like, oh, what's he going to talk about?
[00:09:10.017 --> 00:09:12.318]  I said, you'll get a big, giant history lesson at the first.
[00:09:13.038 --> 00:09:14.898]  We have the clip of me saying it on Monday.
[00:09:14.918 --> 00:09:19.119]  We're going to post it to Bandai Video, or I'll put it out on X, just to show you I do my research.
[00:09:19.639 --> 00:09:22.520]  And I told the whole story of Slob the Wise and all that.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.860]  And that's just known over there.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.201]  That's not known over here.
[00:09:27.181 --> 00:09:28.461]  But I nailed it.
[00:09:28.521 --> 00:09:31.342]  But since I knew that already, I was like, people are going to be bored by this.
[00:09:31.362 --> 00:09:32.402]  They're not going to understand it.
[00:09:33.917 --> 00:09:34.657]  We're good to go.
[00:09:52.745 --> 00:09:54.827]  David Icke joining us for at least an hour and a half.
[00:09:55.468 --> 00:09:59.292]  And I'm calling it a debate because we are going to debate some stuff, but it's a friendly debate.
[00:09:59.592 --> 00:10:00.433]  I love David Icke.
[00:10:00.953 --> 00:10:04.477]  A super great guy, super smart, really liked the guy.
[00:10:04.497 --> 00:10:16.348]  And that's why when he's been kind of pinpecking me a little bit, and that's kind of what it's like, calling me the minion of Elon Musk and stuff, it hurts because...
[00:10:17.665 --> 00:10:17.906]  I think so.
[00:10:33.379 --> 00:10:34.780]  Anybody with that much power you can't trust.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:38.902]  But I'm not going to complain when he's swinging like 80% our direction.
[00:10:38.982 --> 00:10:41.283]  So, I mean, it's that simple.
[00:10:42.123 --> 00:10:48.066]  I never sold out at the Globalist when I was offered the big Fox shows and Rush Limbaugh slot and everything.
[00:10:49.027 --> 00:10:51.208]  Because it was a direct New World Order work for us.
[00:10:51.888 --> 00:10:53.109]  You'll get all this money and power.
[00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:54.370]  I said no to all that.
[00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:58.592]  But when somebody's fighting the Globalist on so many fronts...
[00:11:00.152 --> 00:11:01.873]  And also double-dealing, obviously.
[00:11:01.893 --> 00:11:05.196]  He's got a foot in both worlds, but he's moving way towards us.
[00:11:06.077 --> 00:11:09.319]  I'm going to talk about the good I see and then criticize the bad I see.
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:14.364]  I don't think it's a... David is a purist, which I think is good.
[00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:20.169]  It's good to have him there as the guy that is going to really focus on Musk.
[00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:24.593]  It's good to have that position out there.
[00:11:25.333 --> 00:11:25.553]  But I...
[00:11:26.744 --> 00:11:32.210]  I just cannot in good conscience myself sit here when I see the globalists literally coming after Musk.
[00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:34.091]  He's devastating them.
[00:11:35.253 --> 00:11:37.014]  And sure, he probably wants to take over their system.
[00:11:37.275 --> 00:11:38.075]  He's just a competitor.
[00:11:38.316 --> 00:11:39.357]  That's probably what it is.
[00:11:40.237 --> 00:11:41.639]  Okay, he knows he's way smarter than them.
[00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:45.803]  They're all twisted and inbred and out of control, and he's moving in on them.
[00:11:46.364 --> 00:11:48.065]  That's how they see Trump, by the way.
[00:11:48.986 --> 00:11:50.368]  They see Trump as a competitor.
[00:11:51.201 --> 00:12:05.306]  There's an old saying, I think Frank Herbert wrote about it, but it's been said by philosophers before him, that every revolutionary is an aspiring aristocrat, in that every revolutionary really just wants to be in power.
[00:12:06.786 --> 00:12:07.107]  I think that's
[00:12:22.366 --> 00:12:22.847]  We're good to go.
[00:12:42.648 --> 00:12:44.349]  Got some of the rare writings of Frank Herbert.
[00:12:44.369 --> 00:12:45.309]  Learned a lot from him.
[00:12:45.689 --> 00:12:47.310]  He was a real environmentalist, by the way.
[00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:54.293]  Humans taking control of the environment and terraforming it to turn the desert green and do all these amazing things.
[00:12:54.713 --> 00:13:02.077]  So, again, the globalists hijacked that amazing environmentalist movement of the 60s and by the 80s had it under total control.
[00:13:02.117 --> 00:13:04.618]  But I'm kind of digressing on the Frank Herbert subject.
[00:13:05.878 --> 00:13:09.840]  What I want to talk about here today, we're winning.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.261]  And I've got a short clip
[00:13:12.438 --> 00:13:22.726]  I want to play, when we come back from break, Joe Rogan with the NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who I really admire, not for the NFL.
[00:13:23.306 --> 00:13:24.988]  I mean, I like football.
[00:13:25.048 --> 00:13:26.209]  I mean, I think it's cool.
[00:13:26.309 --> 00:13:31.553]  I mean, I think he's... I like him a thousand times more because he's got courage.
[00:13:32.353 --> 00:13:33.854]  And they had some nice things to say about me.
[00:13:33.894 --> 00:13:35.576]  But what it's really about is...
[00:13:36.803 --> 00:13:46.129]  The fact that this broadcast is now seen by Tucker Carlson, Senator Don Aaron, Joe Rogan, all of them, as the most accurate.
[00:13:46.169 --> 00:13:46.949]  I've made some mistakes.
[00:13:47.029 --> 00:13:48.330]  I've followed rabbit trails.
[00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:48.991]  I've been set up.
[00:13:50.097 --> 00:13:51.118]  I've taken the bait a few times.
[00:13:51.178 --> 00:13:51.758]  I'm not perfect.
[00:13:52.318 --> 00:13:58.461]  But the fact that in this world today, the most popular talk show hosts and people say, Alex Jones is the best we've got.
[00:13:59.221 --> 00:14:00.582]  That shows how far we've come.
[00:14:00.622 --> 00:14:02.563]  It's not about, oh, look, I'm the best we've got.
[00:14:02.643 --> 00:14:04.043]  Boy, I ain't saying much.
[00:14:04.744 --> 00:14:10.747]  But once people get my perspective, it's like wearing the glasses and they live.
[00:14:10.887 --> 00:14:11.827]  I'm not telling you what to think.
[00:14:12.127 --> 00:14:13.468]  I'm like, oh, you don't see that...
[00:14:14.582 --> 00:14:16.983]  20-point buck right behind that tree in the brush.
[00:14:17.343 --> 00:14:24.827]  I'm like, just move your eyes a little and kind of just... My grandfather taught me, a great hunter, to unfocus.
[00:14:25.167 --> 00:14:34.171]  You're sitting there looking at a deer stand in a clearing at 200 yards of woods and deer trails.
[00:14:34.872 --> 00:14:36.892]  He said, if you're looking for the deer, you can't find them.
[00:14:36.933 --> 00:14:39.774]  He said, just sit back and open up your eyes.
[00:14:41.315 --> 00:14:53.819]  And just look in your eye, and the movement, when you pick up, oh, there's a squirrel, there's a rabbit, there's a hawk, there's a crow, there's an armadillo, ooh, there's a 20-point buck.
[00:14:57.205 --> 00:15:02.588]  And that's what I'm trying to get you to do, is not see what I see through my eyeballs.
[00:15:03.368 --> 00:15:06.450]  I read the globalist documents, and I see their plans being unfolded.
[00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:09.211]  And so I know damn well they're in charge.
[00:15:09.231 --> 00:15:10.372]  They're not in total control yet.
[00:15:10.392 --> 00:15:16.935]  They want to get their casual society in, and if they get that in, baby, then we are in a whole world of, you know what, SH-T.
[00:15:17.755 --> 00:15:21.017]  But as soon as people finally listen to me,
[00:15:22.358 --> 00:15:24.699]  And finally, understand how it all connects together.
[00:15:24.759 --> 00:15:27.099]  And I can show them globalist documents and even admit how they do it.
[00:15:28.259 --> 00:15:32.640]  But I'm able to figure out how they're operating and then later even find a document where they admit it all exactly as I saw it.
[00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:34.101]  It's a perspective.
[00:15:34.761 --> 00:15:37.161]  And you've got to admit there's a global elite coming after you.
[00:15:38.602 --> 00:15:40.062]  You've got to admit they're a globalist.
[00:15:40.542 --> 00:15:43.303]  They're trying to dehumanize you.
[00:15:44.303 --> 00:15:45.683]  And they're cold-blooded.
[00:15:45.703 --> 00:15:50.205]  They want you to turn off your life force and turn off your survival mechanism.
[00:15:50.225 --> 00:15:51.805]  All right, Roger Stone's coming up.
[00:15:52.827 --> 00:15:55.546]  David Icke's coming up and so much more.
[00:16:00.225 --> 00:16:00.866]  I'm not perfect.
[00:16:00.886 --> 00:16:01.686]  I'm under a lot of stress.
[00:16:01.726 --> 00:16:05.929]  But if I didn't have the supplements we have, we promote, I wouldn't be able to continue to be on air.
[00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:14.635]  And when you go to InfoWarsStore.com, you are funding the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists in an operation that the enemy admits has been the most effective at exposing them.
[00:16:14.856 --> 00:16:16.477]  Because we're fearless and we don't back down.
[00:16:16.817 --> 00:16:17.838]  We got God on our side.
[00:16:18.078 --> 00:16:19.599]  But God needs to work through you.
[00:16:19.939 --> 00:16:23.962]  You've got to make the decision to get great products you already need at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:16:24.002 --> 00:16:25.243]  And that is a 360 win.
[00:16:25.844 --> 00:16:28.806]  Nitric Boost, without me even knowing, became our number three bestseller.
[00:16:29.486 --> 00:16:31.087]  Because people loved it so much.
[00:16:31.107 --> 00:16:32.048]  They had such great effects.
[00:16:32.348 --> 00:16:38.511]  Got all these natural compounds that clean out the blood, open up your arteries and veins, the capillaries, clean out your heart, your brain, everything.
[00:16:39.312 --> 00:16:41.053]  Well, we got an even better manufacturer.
[00:16:41.073 --> 00:16:45.896]  The other one was great, but one that's even better with even higher quality ingredients at a lower price.
[00:16:46.916 --> 00:16:49.298]  So I could never offer nitric boosters.
[00:16:49.338 --> 00:16:50.819]  It cost us so much to make.
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.841]  And now we can offer it for 40% off.
[00:16:54.382 --> 00:16:58.165]  Infoworkstore.com nitric boost finally back in stock.
[00:16:58.185 --> 00:16:59.786]  40% off out of the gates.
[00:17:00.466 --> 00:17:01.447]  29 years on air.
[00:17:01.767 --> 00:17:04.710]  All I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalist.
[00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:10.753]  And I've done the best job I can to tell those words that have been accurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[00:17:11.154 --> 00:17:13.715]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves.
[00:17:14.136 --> 00:17:18.538]  Unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people, we don't do that.
[00:17:18.979 --> 00:17:20.880]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.261]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product.
[00:17:23.321 --> 00:17:23.942]  It's so powerful.
[00:17:24.842 --> 00:17:29.825]  This is the breakdown product, after your cells process it, of folic acid.
[00:17:30.406 --> 00:17:33.288]  Methylfolate with high quality organic...
[00:17:34.068 --> 00:17:34.849]  Be complex.
[00:17:35.329 --> 00:17:36.590]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:37.451]  It's not a stimulant.
[00:17:37.711 --> 00:17:42.595]  It energizes your cells and then everything else you take just supercharges it.
[00:17:42.655 --> 00:17:43.495]  It's so insane.
[00:17:43.836 --> 00:17:45.357]  It's foundational energy.
[00:17:45.797 --> 00:17:49.940]  The strongest formula out there at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.183]  It doesn't just energize this operation against the tyrants.
[00:17:53.263 --> 00:17:54.383]  It energizes you.
[00:17:54.664 --> 00:17:56.065]  Get foundational energy now.
[00:18:00.299 --> 00:18:00.800]  We're good to go.

[00:19:15.045 --> 00:19:22.974]  Pregnenolone levels decrease with age, and low levels are associated with fatigue, low brain function, and unhealthy aging.

[00:20:13.027 --> 00:20:13.407]  Infowarsstore.com
[00:20:14.398 --> 00:20:36.726]  I want to thank everybody that's joined us on this live, unfiltered, uncensored transmission.
[00:20:36.786 --> 00:20:38.926]  Nobody calls the shots around here but me.
[00:20:42.378 --> 00:20:53.460]  I'm in charge of my destiny, and there are billions of people just like me, and we're coming together, and there is a great awakening, a great renaissance happening, and that's why the globalists are so scared of making their moves.
[00:20:54.201 --> 00:21:01.642]  All right, now this short two-minute Joe Rogan clip with Aaron Rodgers, and they said some other nice stuff about me on the podcast, and again, it's not about me.
[00:21:01.722 --> 00:21:09.464]  It's about I'm this demonized symbol, the worst thing on earth, the corporate media says, and then the biggest talk show host in the world, all of them now,
[00:21:11.277 --> 00:21:11.997]  We're good to go.
[00:21:40.885 --> 00:21:41.586]  We're good to go.
[00:22:05.242 --> 00:22:10.024]  I see David Icke is coming on, I love him to death, criticizing Joe, criticizing, oh, they're gatekeepers.
[00:22:10.124 --> 00:22:11.445]  Oh, I've known Joe 25 years.
[00:22:11.485 --> 00:22:14.186]  I've seen him wake up from kind of a liberal to what he is today.
[00:22:14.487 --> 00:22:15.007]  He's real.
[00:22:15.087 --> 00:22:15.807]  It's a process.
[00:22:15.847 --> 00:22:17.408]  And now he's getting more and more hardcore.
[00:22:17.688 --> 00:22:19.969]  He's about 90% as hardcore as I am on air.
[00:22:20.269 --> 00:22:22.170]  Behind the scenes, my God, he's fully awake.
[00:22:22.871 --> 00:22:25.092]  And then he knows Elon and tells me stuff about Elon.
[00:22:25.192 --> 00:22:26.072]  I don't know Elon.
[00:22:26.392 --> 00:22:29.654]  Elon is totally, at least telling these people he hates the New World Order and wants to bring it down.
[00:22:31.957 --> 00:22:35.720]  Couldn't it be that he would swing around to us because he's got 11 kids and wants to have a future?
[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.923]  I'm not even saying that's going to happen, but we have to think like winners.
[00:22:39.543 --> 00:22:42.306]  We don't delusionally think everything's okay, like Q says.
[00:22:43.407 --> 00:22:48.831]  But we have to also, when things are going our way quickly, not go, no, no, no, those people are fake.
[00:22:50.312 --> 00:22:51.073]  You still watch them.
[00:22:51.113 --> 00:22:52.214]  You still criticize them.
[00:22:52.254 --> 00:22:52.915]  That's all healthy.
[00:22:52.955 --> 00:22:53.835]  What David does is healthy.
[00:22:54.336 --> 00:22:55.657]  And I'll discuss it with David coming up.
[00:22:56.097 --> 00:22:57.118]  I'll play a clip of David in a moment.
[00:22:58.059 --> 00:23:00.181]  But, and guys, print me his tweets from last week.
[00:23:01.571 --> 00:23:03.212]  And in fairness, he gets so many emails.
[00:23:03.272 --> 00:23:03.712]  I do, too.
[00:23:04.513 --> 00:23:05.594]  I was sending him stuff months ago.
[00:23:05.614 --> 00:23:06.614]  I was going into his spam.
[00:23:08.055 --> 00:23:08.555]  He missed them.
[00:23:08.575 --> 00:23:09.076]  He found them.
[00:23:09.516 --> 00:23:15.259]  And when he heard me complain, he went to his email and go, oh, God, they're in the spam, which a lot of the computer systems do that.
[00:23:15.299 --> 00:23:16.240]  They spam the good stuff.
[00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.761]  You learn that, especially if you're using a big computer system.
[00:23:18.801 --> 00:23:19.702]  I don't know what he's using.
[00:23:22.602 --> 00:23:23.584]  And he said, sure, I'll come on.
[00:23:23.744 --> 00:23:31.258]  And plus his daughter, beautiful lady, he's got a beautiful family, and I know some of his family died recently, so I'm not here criticizing David at all.
[00:23:31.278 --> 00:23:32.340]  I think what he's doing is healthy.
[00:23:33.117 --> 00:23:40.202]  But when he put out those tweets where he calls us mams or mammies or something, it's some British term I don't understand, minions.
[00:23:40.583 --> 00:23:48.389]  I looked it up when I did it, and it's basically like I'm a brown noser of Elon Musk, and I'm not seeing the truth now.
[00:23:48.449 --> 00:23:53.833]  I'm covering everything the way I always do, not censoring anything I say.
[00:23:53.853 --> 00:23:57.416]  If I get banned for something I say by Elon, then I'll talk about it.
[00:23:57.836 --> 00:24:02.077]  But I'm not changed one damn thing I do other than like, wow, Elon's really moving in the right direction.
[00:24:02.317 --> 00:24:03.558]  I mean, what am I supposed to say he's not?
[00:24:04.658 --> 00:24:05.959]  How dare you expose the open border?
[00:24:06.459 --> 00:24:07.859]  How dare you say the dangers of AI?
[00:24:08.139 --> 00:24:10.860]  How dare you expose the WEF and say we don't want world government?
[00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.601]  Okay, fine.
[00:24:13.961 --> 00:24:14.701]  Elon Musk is bad.
[00:24:14.721 --> 00:24:15.341]  He shouldn't do any of that.
[00:24:15.942 --> 00:24:16.422]  And then I'll be...
[00:24:17.401 --> 00:24:19.502]  The holy one, I guess, and the perfect person here.
[00:24:21.064 --> 00:24:28.609]  But I understand for folks who have been doing this for 35 years like Ike, myself for 30, there is kind of a, well, we're the OGs, so who are these guys coming along?
[00:24:28.989 --> 00:24:31.471]  Well, I see that as the sign of our success, not our failure.
[00:24:32.403 --> 00:24:43.125]  And that's what God imprinted on me, and I've been talking about it for 20 plus years, that my main mission was to get everybody awake, and when they saw it all come true, when it went from bad to operational, then there'd be the great awakening.
[00:24:43.525 --> 00:24:46.525]  And I didn't just say that when we were able to do this together the last few years.
[00:24:46.565 --> 00:24:47.546]  I've been saying it for decades.
[00:24:47.746 --> 00:24:50.206]  You've heard me talk about it hundreds of times if you're a regular listener.
[00:24:51.266 --> 00:24:56.487]  And so I'm watching God's information, and David got a big download too.
[00:24:56.527 --> 00:24:57.287]  He's got a bunch of them.
[00:24:57.327 --> 00:24:59.928]  So my download told me this, and the download came true.
[00:25:01.048 --> 00:25:01.868]  Here's a clip of Joe Rogan.
[00:25:03.496 --> 00:25:05.297]  You know, it's the Alex Jones was right meme.
[00:25:05.677 --> 00:25:07.158]  Like, can you realize how many times that guy's been right?
[00:25:07.178 --> 00:25:11.561]  Like, how is he so good at predicting all these things that are happening?
[00:25:11.601 --> 00:25:13.283]  Because the guy's balls deep in it all day long.
[00:25:13.743 --> 00:25:14.423]  You can call him right now.
[00:25:14.443 --> 00:25:15.344]  It's like, I'm doing the documents.
[00:25:15.364 --> 00:25:16.385]  I'm doing the research right now.
[00:25:16.405 --> 00:25:16.865]  This is sick.
[00:25:16.885 --> 00:25:17.746]  This is what they're doing.
[00:25:17.766 --> 00:25:18.306]  This is bland.
[00:25:18.946 --> 00:25:19.667]  I talk to him all the time.
[00:25:20.287 --> 00:25:20.788]  We text each other.
[00:25:20.828 --> 00:25:22.209]  Every time something's crazy, I'll text him.
[00:25:22.229 --> 00:25:22.649]  Like, what is this?
[00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:24.150]  And he'll send me all these documents.
[00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:26.671]  He's talking about... I saw something he said the other day about...
[00:25:27.572 --> 00:25:33.755]  You know, you gotta have somebody in case they turn the power off, turn the water off, do something like that.
[00:25:33.795 --> 00:25:36.317]  Well, there's a lot of people that think that, including me.
[00:25:36.917 --> 00:25:40.699]  Because if I was a foreign government and I wanted to cripple America, I would kill the power grid.
[00:25:40.899 --> 00:25:42.700]  We'd go feral in two weeks.
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:43.761]  We're good to go.
[00:25:58.573 --> 00:26:00.255]  Yeah, it's probably what happened back then too.
[00:26:23.174 --> 00:26:23.394]  Yeah.
[00:26:23.614 --> 00:26:30.238]  Well, that's what I've always said is the reason why if you go back, look at like ancient Egypt, look at how insanely sophisticated they were.
[00:26:30.358 --> 00:26:46.686]  And if you subscribe to the Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson's perspective, which I do, which is that at one point in time, there was an incredibly sophisticated society, probably more sophisticated than we are, that lived in Africa, in Egypt, and that those people were probably in a different –
[00:26:47.586 --> 00:26:48.367]  That's Joe Rogan.
[00:26:48.387 --> 00:26:49.207]  That's powerful.
[00:26:49.247 --> 00:26:49.868]  And I know Joe very well.
[00:26:49.948 --> 00:26:50.148]  Okay?
[00:26:50.168 --> 00:26:51.269]  Extremely well.
[00:26:51.289 --> 00:26:51.669]  That's some
[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:20.763]  Parties in Vegas, other places that were like the hangover.
[00:27:21.163 --> 00:27:23.225]  I mean, for a long time ago.
[00:27:25.307 --> 00:27:26.869]  And he's real.
[00:27:27.169 --> 00:27:29.291]  And then people are like, oh no, he's not real because he's popular.
[00:27:29.331 --> 00:27:30.413]  No, freedom's popular.
[00:27:30.533 --> 00:27:31.374]  I know, I'm for real.
[00:27:31.994 --> 00:27:33.756]  So other people like Elon Musk are going to see that.
[00:27:33.776 --> 00:27:34.837]  They're going to come our direction.
[00:27:34.857 --> 00:27:37.079]  For whatever reason, we've got to be ready to win.
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:40.423]  Here's David Icke about the interview coming up in about 30 minutes.
[00:27:44.861 --> 00:27:45.481]  Hello everybody.
[00:27:45.501 --> 00:27:59.811]  Tonight, 6pm UK, I'll be talking live with Alex Jones in the United States about my views, I've been quite controversial, but that's a change, isn't it?
[00:28:00.972 --> 00:28:13.020]  About the way the, what I call the mainstream alternative media, the MAM, has been eulogising and not questioning in the way that it would have done before
[00:28:14.147 --> 00:28:20.632]  The actions, activities, and companies and agenda of Elon Musk.
[00:28:21.572 --> 00:28:30.759]  Apparently, there's a chance, we'll see, of Elon Musk coming on, which I would be absolutely delighted about.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:34.802]  But otherwise, we're going to be knocking this subject around.
[00:28:35.563 --> 00:28:38.705]  And it's something that has to be debated.
[00:28:39.784 --> 00:28:48.213]  Because the alternative media is being neutered currently, and it has to stop.
[00:28:49.834 --> 00:28:58.203]  All right, now we're going to put a Spaces out in the last half of the Ike interview just for Elon to call it if he wants.
[00:28:58.243 --> 00:28:58.744]  He does that.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.342]  But folks, we're standing up for our rights.
[00:29:01.362 --> 00:29:02.443]  We're standing up for your rights.
[00:29:02.463 --> 00:29:04.865]  We're standing up for all of our freedoms and our children.
[00:29:05.085 --> 00:29:12.732]  If you don't spread the word about the broadcast, if you don't share the links, if you don't buy products at InfoWarsStore.com, then I'm not griping at you.
[00:29:12.752 --> 00:29:13.853]  I'm just saying, what are you doing?
[00:29:14.954 --> 00:29:18.216]  Less than 1% of you ever buy a product at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:29:19.116 --> 00:29:26.098]  If just a half a percent more would go buy a book or a film or a t-shirt or get some of our great supplements and then reorder them because they really work.
[00:29:26.438 --> 00:29:27.019]  Just try it.

[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:33.701]  I'm praying to God that he'll touch your heart to decide to support us.

[00:29:47.492 --> 00:29:48.153]  And I mean good ones.
[00:29:48.173 --> 00:29:49.353]  I'm going to leave it at that.

[00:30:01.479 --> 00:30:02.639]  Winter is coming.
[00:30:07.105 --> 00:30:08.606]  Winter is coming.
[00:30:08.906 --> 00:30:10.307]  Winter isn't coming.
[00:30:10.888 --> 00:30:12.169]  Winter is here.

[00:32:03.592 --> 00:32:05.173]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:32:05.894 --> 00:32:08.955]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:32:09.836 --> 00:32:13.778]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers...
[00:32:15.208 --> 00:32:17.912]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:32:18.753 --> 00:32:26.564]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:32:27.566 --> 00:32:30.429]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:32:30.449 --> 00:32:36.215]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:32:37.016 --> 00:32:37.917]  I know you spread the word.
[00:32:37.957 --> 00:32:39.439]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[00:32:39.479 --> 00:32:40.000]  Keep doing it.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:46.667]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[00:32:47.107 --> 00:32:48.289]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[00:32:48.969 --> 00:32:52.630]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Enforce.com.
[00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:57.891]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Enforce.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:32:58.211 --> 00:32:59.091]  Please take action now.
[00:33:01.171 --> 00:33:07.112]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:13.153 --> 00:33:16.434]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:17.589 --> 00:33:20.717]  ...to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:24.581 --> 00:33:29.163]  For months before you were asked about your age, you would respond with the words, watch me.
[00:33:29.583 --> 00:33:34.526]  Many American people have been watching, and they have expressed concerns about your age.
[00:33:34.546 --> 00:33:36.126]  That is your judgment.
[00:33:36.166 --> 00:33:37.447]  That is your judgment.
[00:33:37.467 --> 00:33:39.788]  That is not the judgment of the press.
[00:33:39.888 --> 00:33:42.149]  They express concerns about your mental acuity.
[00:33:42.189 --> 00:33:43.430]  They say that you are too old.
[00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:49.472]  Mr. President, in December, you told me that you believe there are many other Democrats who could defeat Donald Trump.
[00:33:49.712 --> 00:33:51.773]  So why does it have to be you now?
[00:33:51.913 --> 00:33:53.194]  What is your answer to that question?
[00:33:53.254 --> 00:33:56.936]  I'll find a person in this country to be president of the United States and finish the job I started.
[00:34:00.819 --> 00:34:10.865]  As you know, initially, the president of Mexico, Osisi, did not want to open up the gate to allow humanitarian material to get in.
[00:34:11.806 --> 00:34:12.427]  I talked to him.
[00:34:13.167 --> 00:34:14.388]  I convinced him to open the gate.
[00:34:15.068 --> 00:34:17.110]  I talked to Bibi to open the gate on the Israeli side.
[00:34:19.167 --> 00:34:19.748]  We're good to go.
[00:34:19.848 --> 00:34:20.068]  I think?
[00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:45.333]  Everybody knows you leave milk in the refrigerator too long, expiration date, you smell it or you taste it, you spit it out, you throw it away.
[00:34:46.013 --> 00:34:53.698]  But have you ever had like a hunting cabin or something, you haven't been in it in six months, you leave a gallon of milk in there and you come back and it's just solid matter.
[00:34:53.758 --> 00:34:54.758]  It's turning to yogurt.
[00:34:54.778 --> 00:34:55.619]  It's totally rotten.
[00:34:56.659 --> 00:34:57.880]  That's Biden.
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.001]  He's like two-year-old milk.
[00:35:01.001 --> 00:35:06.945]  And so Roger Stone's the first person two-plus years ago, the first to say they're going to remove him
[00:35:08.232 --> 00:35:08.793]  We're good to go.
[00:35:08.813 --> 00:35:09.894]  We're good to go.
[00:35:30.305 --> 00:35:36.471]  And you've got the FBI not charging him, the Justice Department not charging him, but admitting he's guilty of illegally having documents.
[00:35:36.491 --> 00:35:38.013]  His vice president had no right to do that.
[00:35:38.534 --> 00:35:40.476]  But Trump's still charged when he can legally have them.
[00:35:40.876 --> 00:35:43.879]  This is next level hypocrisy.
[00:35:44.199 --> 00:35:52.108]  So every time they charge him for something he didn't do or have a show trial without even a jury or tell the jury he's already guilty, he goes up five points.
[00:35:53.348 --> 00:36:01.890]  So I guess he's going to go up more now that he's charged for legally having documents, but Biden, they say, had him illegally, but since his brain is Swiss cheese, he can't.
[00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:18.152]  So Trump confidant, Richard Nixon confidant, literal living political legend, he's a political fossil, but doesn't look like one, he's in better shape than me, damn it, I'm jealous, and better dressed, is my good friend Roger Stone.
[00:36:18.472 --> 00:36:21.273]  Roger, this is not a boring time to be alive, is it?
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:28.334]  No, Alex, this is actually one of the most tumultuous weeks I've ever seen in American politics.
[00:36:28.755 --> 00:36:32.084]  I think yesterday, late yesterday, was a flashpoint.
[00:36:32.705 --> 00:36:35.346]  Let's be very clear about what exactly what happened.
[00:36:35.406 --> 00:36:53.455]  A special counsel, Robert Herr, who was appointed by Merrick Garland, who is Joe Biden's attorney general, released a report in which he essentially said, firstly, that Biden did, in fact, illegally retain classified and top secret documents.
[00:36:54.102 --> 00:36:55.844]  We're good to go.
[00:37:09.256 --> 00:37:10.337]  We're good to go.
[00:37:28.514 --> 00:37:29.075]  And so on.
[00:37:29.155 --> 00:37:34.120]  So now Biden comes out charging out of the gate, attacking the press.
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:39.004]  His counsel puts out a statement attacking his own Justice Department.
[00:37:39.465 --> 00:37:41.667]  Joe cannot have it both ways.
[00:37:42.407 --> 00:37:53.338]  He cannot avoid prosecution because he's not mentally capable of standing trial, at the same time saying, reelect me, let's keep my fingers on the nuclear codes.
[00:37:53.758 --> 00:37:54.179]  Alex Jones Show!
[00:37:54.199 --> 00:37:55.221]  We're good to go.
[00:37:55.241 --> 00:37:55.421]  I think?
[00:38:09.212 --> 00:38:23.202]  Well, people say Alex Jones as a crystal ball, but buddy, I've learned to not roll my eyes at you because everything you say comes true, but how the hell did you, at least two and a half years ago, say they'll remove him in 2024?
[00:38:23.302 --> 00:38:25.943]  And I said, well, maybe earlier.
[00:38:25.963 --> 00:38:27.705]  And he said, you said no, and you've been on the air
[00:38:28.541 --> 00:38:28.741]  I think?
[00:38:43.908 --> 00:38:56.193]  Well, going all the way back to the time that I was proud to do a show at InfoWars, the War Room, which I proudly co-hosted with my friend Owen Schroyer, the whole point of InfoWars is tomorrow's news today.
[00:38:56.613 --> 00:39:00.195]  First of all, one needs to understand the character of Joe Biden.
[00:39:00.635 --> 00:39:10.703]  You may remember perhaps a year and a half ago, maybe longer, when Senator Lindsey Graham said, well, even if you disagree with Joe politically, you've got to admit he's a nice guy.
[00:39:10.823 --> 00:39:15.327]  Actually, nobody I know who knows him thinks he's a nice guy.
[00:39:15.387 --> 00:39:20.471]  People think that he is a nasty, self-centered, egotistical prick.
[00:39:20.971 --> 00:39:25.412]  By the way, you predicted a year ago and over and over again that he and his fake doctor wife
[00:39:49.229 --> 00:39:58.037]  I think that they are actually in charge and not Obama and that he's going to go kicking and screaming and that that's going to be the crisis that they would then start the indictments of his son and the pressure.
[00:39:58.418 --> 00:40:02.201]  Everything you said to the letter, like you wrote the symphony, is now happening.
[00:40:04.183 --> 00:40:07.206]  Alex, I can't disagree, but let's look at yesterday for a second.
[00:40:07.246 --> 00:40:08.628]  First of all, the report makes clear
[00:40:10.785 --> 00:40:16.870]  That he could not remember when he was vice president, that he could not remember the date of his son's death.
[00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:21.454]  He has variously said his son died in combat or died in the service.
[00:40:21.494 --> 00:40:28.119]  His son died of a brain tumor in Delaware when he was the attorney general, God rest his soul.
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:30.801]  We're good to go.
[00:40:53.439 --> 00:40:53.799]  I think?
[00:41:07.459 --> 00:41:16.721]  It's interesting that just in the last couple weeks, we have read credible reports that Joe Biden wanted to dump Kamala Harris as his running mate.
[00:41:17.521 --> 00:41:26.783]  But what I see as a growing possibility, Alex, is a removal of Joe Biden under the 25th Amendment.
[00:41:26.823 --> 00:41:32.224]  Remember, Trump said that when they floated against him in his last few months in office when they stole the election in 2020.
[00:41:32.584 --> 00:41:32.904]  He said...
[00:41:34.694 --> 00:41:37.935]  He said two words, you know, 25th Amendment, Biden.
[00:41:37.995 --> 00:41:38.535]  Remember that clip?
[00:41:39.535 --> 00:41:40.155]  Yes, I do.
[00:41:40.716 --> 00:41:42.296]  It turns out to be precinct.
[00:41:42.416 --> 00:41:44.957]  I mean, let's talk about how that works.
[00:41:45.537 --> 00:41:55.159]  So the 25th Amendment allows for the removal of an elected president for reasons of mental incapacity.
[00:41:55.659 --> 00:42:01.601]  And all it requires is a majority of the cabinet plus the support of the vice president.
[00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:04.431]  Well, would Kamala Harris like to be president?
[00:42:04.491 --> 00:42:05.891]  You know that she would.
[00:42:06.331 --> 00:42:11.732]  Does she not want to get dealt out in this shuffle with Michelle Obama and the Obamas?
[00:42:12.032 --> 00:42:13.473]  You can bet on that as well.
[00:42:13.493 --> 00:42:23.955]  Plus, she can't be very happy about the story she read 10 days ago saying that Joe Biden was planning to replace her with Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan.
[00:42:24.035 --> 00:42:31.497]  So I really think that a 25th Amendment scenario here is increasingly likely.
[00:42:32.213 --> 00:42:38.398]  Joe Biden can no longer pretend that the emperor is wearing clothes, and he can't have it both ways.
[00:42:38.618 --> 00:42:42.301]  He should be prosecuted for his illegal retention.
[00:42:42.341 --> 00:42:45.924]  Remember, vice presidents are not allowed to retain any documents.
[00:42:46.933 --> 00:42:51.816]  These are from his time as vice president, also from his time as a U.S.
[00:42:51.936 --> 00:42:57.899]  senator, and then argue in the next breath that he's fit enough to control the nuclear codes.
[00:42:58.739 --> 00:43:02.341]  Remember how much trouble Sandy Berger got for sticking one secret document in his sock?
[00:43:02.621 --> 00:43:03.741]  So the law is very clear.
[00:43:03.761 --> 00:43:06.163]  So how do they...
[00:43:07.236 --> 00:43:07.496]  I don't know.
[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:30.800]  You know, does it matter?
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:34.562]  I think it matters to voters, and that's the important thing, that people can see this.
[00:43:34.622 --> 00:43:39.763]  I mean, the mainstream media covered that disaster of a press conference last night.
[00:43:39.803 --> 00:43:47.626]  I haven't seen anything like that since Richard Nixon angrily said, I'm finished with politics, you won't have Nixon to kick around anymore.
[00:43:47.686 --> 00:43:53.608]  It was one of those defining moments, and Joe is arguing with the press about what the press is...
[00:43:54.028 --> 00:43:58.709]  I was about to say, that's what they claim Putin does, is control all the press, and he does to a great extent.
[00:43:58.749 --> 00:44:01.490]  But he's saying, oh, I speak for the press, I tell you what the press believes.
[00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:02.591]  I mean, it was a very dictatorial comment.
[00:44:17.682 --> 00:44:20.004]  Yeah, it was a very, very telling moment.
[00:44:20.284 --> 00:44:22.405]  Again, let's look at the process.
[00:44:22.586 --> 00:44:28.430]  This will become much easier, of course, if they do remove Joe under the 25th Amendment.
[00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:37.016]  They might let him stay as president and agree not to remove him on the condition that he drop his plans for re-election.
[00:44:37.456 --> 00:44:38.397]  I think we're good to go.
[00:44:57.803 --> 00:45:00.885]  I see them taking Biden right up to the convention.
[00:45:01.265 --> 00:45:05.547]  They've cleared the field so that he can continue to win delegates.
[00:45:05.787 --> 00:45:09.809]  By the way, smashing victory by Donald Trump yesterday in Nevada.
[00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:11.730]  Some will say, well, he was unopposed.
[00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:12.791]  Look at the turnout numbers.
[00:45:12.811 --> 00:45:12.791]  16%.
[00:45:13.191 --> 00:45:15.412]  So what's going to happen with Birdbrain?
[00:45:19.165 --> 00:45:23.248]  Well, we have to figure out why Nikki Haley's in this race.
[00:45:23.308 --> 00:45:31.795]  If she's in this race to Hector and Badger Donald Trump on the hopes of getting on the ticket, that's just not going to happen.
[00:45:31.855 --> 00:45:37.400]  The days when you saw balance in the party or geographic balance, those days are over.
[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:42.144]  Trump needs a solid America first, make America great.
[00:45:42.164 --> 00:45:46.087]  Sure, well, the Washington Post said it's in case they kill him or he dies.
[00:45:46.127 --> 00:45:46.887]  That's what they said.
[00:45:48.277 --> 00:45:53.643]  Well, and I think that's why Governor DeSantis is now suddenly pop up talking about all kinds of federal issues.
[00:45:53.683 --> 00:45:58.508]  He's talking about term limits, talking about constitutional amendment for a balanced budget.
[00:45:59.028 --> 00:46:00.970]  I wish he would stick to his knitting in Florida.
[00:46:01.331 --> 00:46:02.572]  We have an insurance crisis.
[00:46:02.872 --> 00:46:04.294]  We have a utility rate crisis.
[00:46:04.834 --> 00:46:06.736]  We have a growing crime crisis.
[00:46:07.477 --> 00:46:10.360]  But he's letting everybody know that he's staying by equipment.
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:15.221]  Again, I don't think anything is going to deny Donald Trump this nomination.
[00:46:15.561 --> 00:46:18.122]  So Nikki Haley is either hanging out for one of two reasons.
[00:46:18.602 --> 00:46:21.702]  One, because she thinks she can euchre her way onto the ticket.
[00:46:21.902 --> 00:46:23.003]  That's not going to happen.
[00:46:23.963 --> 00:46:25.103]  I guarantee you that.
[00:46:25.763 --> 00:46:38.506]  Or she is there as a puppet for the Uniparty on the theory that her attacks on Donald Trump are helpful to Joe Biden or whoever it is they replaced Joe Biden with.
[00:46:39.702 --> 00:46:43.385]  All right, Roger, you've got the floor here for your predictions on what you think Trump should do.
[00:46:45.607 --> 00:46:48.790]  Well, I mean, I actually think this plays directly into his hands.
[00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:55.235]  I mean, we're wrangling with the special counsel in both Florida and in D.C.
[00:46:55.275 --> 00:47:06.544]  In Florida, I'm not an attorney, as you know, but it appears to me they want him to stand trial for the retention of certain documents, but they won't tell him or the American people anything.
[00:47:07.054 --> 00:47:09.827]  What those documents are or what they regard.
[00:47:09.847 --> 00:47:10.711]  I don't know how...
[00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:14.492]  That cannot look unfair to the American people.
[00:47:15.413 --> 00:47:24.519]  And additionally now, he has the additional argument that Joe Biden, by the words of his own Justice Department, violated the law.
[00:47:25.259 --> 00:47:32.984]  By the way, this idea that Biden cooperated and Trump didn't, that's contradicted in Mr. Herr's report as well.
[00:47:33.044 --> 00:47:34.685]  He did not cooperate.
[00:47:34.725 --> 00:47:39.769]  They searched his house without his approval, seizing these notebooks that
[00:47:40.169 --> 00:47:40.830]  We're good to go.
[00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:41.050]  I think?
[00:48:05.703 --> 00:48:08.086]  Big decisions before the Supreme Court.
[00:48:08.987 --> 00:48:24.786]  I thought Trump's attorneys did a good job on the issue of ballot access, the so-called Colorado case, which really is going to set the pace for all of these illicit, anti-democratic, autocratic efforts to get Trump off the ballot because he is
[00:48:25.733 --> 00:48:27.054]  Engaged in insurrection.
[00:48:27.074 --> 00:48:28.736]  According to what court?
[00:48:28.896 --> 00:48:31.398]  That's a subjective opinion from some leftists.
[00:48:31.758 --> 00:48:33.060]  I think he's going to win that issue.
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:37.223]  I'm more concerned about the question of presidential immunity.
[00:48:38.204 --> 00:48:39.665]  I'm less confident about that.
[00:48:39.785 --> 00:48:41.347]  But I will also make this point.
[00:48:42.027 --> 00:48:50.615]  If they decide that Trump does not have immunity for his acts as president, well, then Barack Obama can be sued for the drone killing of U.S.
[00:48:50.655 --> 00:48:51.055]  citizens.
[00:48:51.585 --> 00:48:51.845]  I think?
[00:49:21.741 --> 00:49:25.882]  All right, Roger, I would be remiss if I didn't talk about the Tucker Carlson interview.
[00:49:25.922 --> 00:49:28.023]  It's obviously bigger than Carlson, bigger than Putin.
[00:49:28.343 --> 00:49:31.324]  It's about trying to stop World War III, and it's about the war against the press.
[00:49:32.504 --> 00:49:36.245]  And the idea that Tucker couldn't go interview whoever he wants.
[00:49:36.285 --> 00:49:40.747]  They're calling for him to be indicted for the Espionage Act.
[00:49:41.447 --> 00:49:41.907]  All of this.
[00:49:41.967 --> 00:49:44.148]  And then I watched the whole thing last night and watched part of it.
[00:49:45.774 --> 00:49:47.695]  Again, this morning, but all the other news is so pressing.
[00:49:47.715 --> 00:49:51.378]  I'm going to cover it more on a special Saturday show and Sunday and Monday.
[00:49:51.658 --> 00:49:52.999]  It's so big, we need to unpack it all.
[00:49:53.019 --> 00:50:00.285]  But we saw a real intellect, no matter what you think about Putin, he's obviously a strong man and doesn't play games, that is in charge of a country.
[00:50:00.945 --> 00:50:01.446]  We're good to go.
[00:50:18.704 --> 00:50:20.145]  So you can see the respect they mean.
[00:50:20.366 --> 00:50:21.506]  Nobody talks to Putin like that.
[00:50:21.907 --> 00:50:23.228]  But they know he's so real.
[00:50:23.788 --> 00:50:26.290]  And the Russians kept saying, we just want into the West.
[00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:27.511]  We just want to make money with you.
[00:50:27.792 --> 00:50:29.153]  We don't want to be communists anymore.
[00:50:29.433 --> 00:50:34.237]  And he used all the examples of NATO and how they tried to enter NATO and all of this.
[00:50:35.078 --> 00:50:36.879]  And I think the interview was so intellectual.
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:39.321]  It's already gotten hundreds of millions of views on Exelon.
[00:50:39.341 --> 00:50:42.284]  It'll get a billion views by the time it's all done, one way or another.
[00:50:42.324 --> 00:50:43.705]  The clips will get tens of billions of views.
[00:50:44.265 --> 00:50:45.706]  This was one of the biggest interviews ever.
[00:50:45.746 --> 00:50:47.328]  This was like moon landing level coverage.
[00:50:48.389 --> 00:50:50.872]  If the left would have not attacked it, it wouldn't have gotten the views.
[00:50:50.952 --> 00:50:57.279]  Again, the power structure has inherited American greatness.
[00:50:57.339 --> 00:51:02.525]  I mean, you worked with all these really smart, and the IQs were higher, people were harder working.
[00:51:02.545 --> 00:51:06.129]  I mean, you worked around Nixon, who was really the president and a master of statecraft.
[00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:07.170]  We're good to go.
[00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:31.190]  Well, first of all, it was fascinating.
[00:51:31.571 --> 00:51:39.736]  Obviously, Putin, he's got the cold, steely eyes of a killer, clearly in command of the facts.
[00:51:40.517 --> 00:51:43.599]  An interesting sense of humor, pushed back several times.
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:48.643]  He detailed the treachery of dealing with the United States under George H.W.
[00:51:48.683 --> 00:51:52.786]  Bush, who basically said, I had a great relationship with him, except for he lied to me.
[00:51:53.867 --> 00:52:01.592]  His frustration with what he thought would happen after the fall of the Iron Curtain.
[00:52:01.832 --> 00:52:10.938]  I was thinking, as I watched this, how disappointed Nixon would have been because we had an opportunity to achieve a real lasting peace.
[00:52:10.998 --> 00:52:22.086]  We clearly had an opportunity to have a missile defense system that might have protected us from Islamic maniacs, but the Russians clearly seemed to be repelled.
[00:52:22.706 --> 00:52:31.110]  What's laughable, Alex, is this guy John Kirby, who was the spokesman for the Defense Department, urging people not to watch.
[00:52:31.550 --> 00:52:33.511]  I mean, can you imagine not to watch?
[00:52:33.571 --> 00:52:40.453]  Well, number one, doesn't he know when you tell your kids, like your dad says, don't get in my Playboys, the first thing you do when he goes to play golf is get in the Playboys?
[00:52:41.474 --> 00:52:42.374]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:52:42.434 --> 00:52:43.895]  So in this particular case, he says...
[00:52:45.147 --> 00:52:54.870]  Well, sadly, based on what we know, Mr. Putin is substantially more credible than John Kirby.
[00:52:54.971 --> 00:53:02.113]  Just days ago, the people in this administration were telling us that our southern border was secure, just for an example.
[00:53:04.044 --> 00:53:04.424]  You're right.
[00:53:04.464 --> 00:53:05.726]  There's a huge amount there.
[00:53:05.826 --> 00:53:08.409]  It's 127 minutes.
[00:53:08.489 --> 00:53:09.731]  I watched every bit of it.
[00:53:11.132 --> 00:53:15.698]  It's very interesting how hysterical the left is.
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:21.922]  Just based on the idea that people will be exposed to Putin's arguments.
[00:53:22.002 --> 00:53:24.643]  It shows they've lost control, and others signed them.
[00:53:24.903 --> 00:53:25.463]  They're totally dead.
[00:53:25.683 --> 00:53:35.887]  How would a genius of Putin level, I mean, how would Nixon, if he was president today, how would Richard Nixon deal with Putin?
[00:53:36.227 --> 00:53:40.068]  I think he would see opportunity for both peace and prosperity for both our countries.
[00:53:40.448 --> 00:53:45.710]  I mean, these people have the nuclear bomb, and you can't just keep brushing them off and lying to them.
[00:53:46.471 --> 00:53:55.556]  I thought that that historical beginning, which I thought in the beginning might just be stonewalling, he laid that out for a specific reason.
[00:53:55.576 --> 00:53:58.257]  I think we've missed a classic opportunity.
[00:53:58.797 --> 00:54:03.500]  I still, I don't have the benign view of China that he does.
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:04.540]  I think China... You know, I agree.
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:06.501]  That was the biggest thing is this Xi Jinping thing.
[00:54:06.822 --> 00:54:09.663]  And Russia's never trusted China, but now they're having to work with him because of the war.
[00:54:10.003 --> 00:54:14.065]  But absolutely, Putin basically said, we're 1,100 years old, man.
[00:54:14.305 --> 00:54:15.286]  We're not communists.
[00:54:15.606 --> 00:54:17.969]  And I don't like Lenin giving Ukraine away.
[00:54:18.289 --> 00:54:19.250]  And he explained all that.
[00:54:19.351 --> 00:54:20.612]  He was like, dude, we're not communists.
[00:54:20.632 --> 00:54:22.054]  He said, we're Orthodox Christians.
[00:54:22.214 --> 00:54:23.255]  We're having a bunch of babies.
[00:54:23.456 --> 00:54:24.256]  We want to make money.
[00:54:24.517 --> 00:54:25.218]  Leave us alone.
[00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:29.703]  That's a very good summation of the arguments.
[00:54:29.963 --> 00:54:31.265]  I kind of think it's funny that
[00:54:31.983 --> 00:54:37.247]  No one called for the prosecution of George Stephanopoulos when he interviewed Putin.
[00:54:37.307 --> 00:54:41.451]  Nobody called for the prosecution of Mike Wallace when he interviewed Putin.
[00:54:42.071 --> 00:54:45.954]  Nobody called for the prosecution of Barbara Walters when she interviewed Putin.
[00:54:45.974 --> 00:54:48.656]  He's the same guy then as he was now.
[00:54:48.696 --> 00:54:50.838]  Roger, I know you've got to go, but I've got to go to break.
[00:54:50.878 --> 00:54:54.961]  Can you hold until 5 average just to finish up with how you think they're going to move against Trump next?
[00:54:55.321 --> 00:54:56.983]  And then also tell us whether to find your show.
[00:54:58.052 --> 00:54:58.992]  Sure, absolutely.
[00:55:20.103 --> 00:55:22.604]  And she looked at the back and she said, well, I take turmeric.
[00:55:22.644 --> 00:55:25.646]  I got to take like four horse pills, which make my hip stop hurting.
[00:55:26.026 --> 00:55:27.507]  But you're saying I only got to take two of these.
[00:55:27.547 --> 00:55:28.708]  And I said, just take it for a week.
[00:55:29.348 --> 00:55:30.128]  She's addicted to it.
[00:55:30.168 --> 00:55:31.929]  She said, why does it work so much better?
[00:55:31.949 --> 00:55:34.030]  I said, because they make you just call it turmeric.
[00:55:34.310 --> 00:55:36.031]  It's turmeric concentrate.
[00:55:36.332 --> 00:55:38.193]  It's 95% curcuminoid.
[00:55:38.473 --> 00:55:41.114]  We went to the top lab and said, what's the strongest you put out?
[00:55:41.134 --> 00:55:41.474]  They said like 87%.
[00:55:43.294 --> 00:55:43.874]  We're good to go.
[00:56:07.731 --> 00:56:09.673]  It's good for your heart, your brain, everything.
[00:56:09.813 --> 00:56:12.656]  It is 40% off back in stock.
[00:56:12.756 --> 00:56:14.798]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:56:15.338 --> 00:56:20.543]  Infowarsstore.com The all-time fan classic.
[00:56:20.583 --> 00:56:23.105]  Body's 40% off back in stock.
[00:56:24.904 --> 00:56:29.990]  Even made stronger, new and improved, and we got it with a bigger manufacturer, so we can discount it, too.
[00:56:30.551 --> 00:56:31.612]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:32.013 --> 00:56:33.394]  We have Nitric Boost.
[00:56:33.474 --> 00:56:36.278]  It cleans out the blood, the heart, goes out to spike proteins, everything.
[00:56:36.598 --> 00:56:41.003]  Dr. Minkiewicz is talking about this for 40% off as well.
[00:56:41.204 --> 00:56:43.506]  And this is selling out, but despite that, it's still 30% off.
[00:56:44.347 --> 00:56:51.171]  It's next level foundational energy, the methylfolate, the key compound of other ingredients that clean out your cells and that are the main energy source.
[00:56:51.532 --> 00:56:52.632]  Popeye takes spinach.
[00:56:52.933 --> 00:56:53.853]  That's why it's so strong.
[00:56:53.893 --> 00:56:54.414]  What's in that?
[00:56:54.494 --> 00:56:55.174]  Folic acid.
[00:56:55.394 --> 00:57:00.177]  This is the breakdown concentrate of folic acid after the cells break it down.
[00:57:00.457 --> 00:57:05.821]  So this just goes right in there like nitrous oxide in a race car, okay?
[00:57:06.041 --> 00:57:09.863]  So you go from 800 horsepower to 1,500 horsepower when you turn on the nitrous.
[00:57:10.023 --> 00:57:10.244]  Boom!
[00:57:11.324 --> 00:57:13.345]  I can't even take this, okay?
[00:57:13.686 --> 00:57:15.787]  Okay, I turn into a psychotic goblin.
[00:57:16.247 --> 00:57:22.251]  Okay, but I'm just telling you right now, you want next-level foundational energy, get it, InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:22.311 --> 00:57:23.631]  Roger, we're coming right back to you.
[00:57:23.872 --> 00:57:25.953]  What's the best website for you, StoneZone.com?
[00:57:26.813 --> 00:57:28.514]  StoneZone.com, absolutely.
[00:57:29.055 --> 00:57:31.896]  Wow, look at that amazing individual right there.
[00:57:31.916 --> 00:57:34.238]  That's a survivor, that's a fighter, that's a maverick.
[00:57:34.977 --> 00:57:35.778]  I have the coolest job.
[00:57:35.798 --> 00:57:37.240]  I can know all the cool people, man.
[00:57:38.181 --> 00:57:41.586]  Tucker Carlson, Roger Stone, Joe Rogan, everybody else.
[00:57:41.686 --> 00:57:42.707]  Wow, I love my job.
[00:57:42.927 --> 00:57:44.169]  And I get to know all of you.
[00:57:44.449 --> 00:57:47.854]  We'll be right back in two minutes with Roger Stone, then David Icke.
[00:57:51.755 --> 00:57:52.995]  Gunther in Tennessee.
[00:57:53.035 --> 00:57:54.076]  Thanks for calling, Gunther.
[00:57:54.236 --> 00:57:54.576]  Hey, Alex.
[00:57:54.776 --> 00:57:55.516]  First time caller.
[00:57:55.616 --> 00:57:57.456]  Real quick, wanted to plug your foundational energy.
[00:57:57.996 --> 00:57:58.957]  Just started taking that.
[00:57:59.617 --> 00:58:03.938]  And, boy, three pills, recommended dose, I was bouncing off the walls.
[00:58:04.058 --> 00:58:10.119]  But I tell you, foundational is the right name for that product because I've cut down to one.
[00:58:10.299 --> 00:58:14.540]  It's like you have a baseline of energy that you were missing before that you got back.
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:14.760]  So,
[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:23.204]  Well, I'm glad you mentioned that because it's methylfolate, the breakdown of folic acid, and a lot of people, particularly Europeans, don't absorb all of the folic acid.
[00:58:23.444 --> 00:58:24.545]  So it's not a stimulant.
[00:58:24.765 --> 00:58:28.187]  It's a totally natural thing that boosts energy that's foundational.
[00:58:28.467 --> 00:58:31.028]  And was I lying to you or did it not work?
[00:58:31.728 --> 00:58:32.909]  No, it was top-notch.
[00:58:32.969 --> 00:58:36.591]  And I was actually taking Red Pill Plus before, and that's got a little folic acid in it.
[00:58:36.631 --> 00:58:40.433]  I think there was a little buildup from this, but the energy from this was no jitters.
[00:58:40.613 --> 00:58:41.674]  I mean, it's top-notch.
[00:58:41.694 --> 00:58:42.354]  It's a great product.
[00:58:42.759 --> 00:58:43.719]  Well, thank you so much.
[00:58:43.759 --> 00:58:44.080]  Yeah, no.
[00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:47.521]  Folic acid's great and it's in real red pill, but some can't break it down.
[00:58:47.561 --> 00:58:48.561]  This is the breakdown of it.
[00:58:48.641 --> 00:58:49.422]  That's exactly it.
[00:58:50.542 --> 00:58:56.004]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[00:58:56.745 --> 00:59:01.027]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[00:59:01.427 --> 00:59:05.809]  We finally have a limited run back in supply at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:59:07.249 --> 00:59:10.030]  So many people have serious issues.
[00:59:10.291 --> 00:59:11.411]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[00:59:11.851 --> 00:59:17.274]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[00:59:17.814 --> 00:59:23.216]  Most of their iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[00:59:23.836 --> 00:59:26.738]  But this is pure atomic certified iodine.
[00:59:28.513 --> 00:59:29.794]  I don't know.
[00:59:29.854 --> 00:59:32.496]  X2 is now back in stock, discounted.
[00:59:32.856 --> 00:59:36.019]  So I'm giving Thanksgiving right now for this product being here.
[00:59:36.359 --> 00:59:41.463]  It funds the InfoWar, but I guarantee you, you take this for a few weeks, you will feel the difference.
[00:59:41.623 --> 00:59:42.423]  It is amazing.
[00:59:42.744 --> 00:59:48.748]  It's the missing link, X2, back in stock at the end of 2023 at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:59:49.189 --> 00:59:49.589]  X2.
[00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:57.515]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:02.347 --> 01:00:16.682]  In the last nine years, Putin has told the West and NATO hundreds of times, face to face, at every major meeting, I'm going to invade Ukraine if you continue to push out the Russians and move weapons in and have them join NATO.
[01:00:17.779 --> 01:00:18.260]  We're good to go.
[01:00:37.699 --> 01:00:38.860]  But they keep doubling down.
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:44.525]  So on politics, as positive things are, as strong as Trump is, they just keep escalating.
[01:00:44.565 --> 01:00:48.729]  So what do you expect next for them to throw at Trump, and what can we do to protect President Trump?
[01:00:48.949 --> 01:00:55.735]  I know a big thing is he's running out of money when it comes to his campaign, and the media is giggling and laughing about that.
[01:00:55.775 --> 01:00:59.539]  So just because he's ahead doesn't mean he doesn't need support and donations.
[01:00:59.559 --> 01:01:02.381]  I think we can't get overconfident here is what I'm saying.
[01:01:02.421 --> 01:01:03.102]  Roger, what do you think?
[01:01:04.493 --> 01:01:06.157]  Alex, I totally agree with that.
[01:01:06.177 --> 01:01:07.501]  One of the things that surprised me...
[01:01:08.115 --> 01:01:09.496]  I'm very familiar with this argument.
[01:01:34.589 --> 01:01:34.909]  We're good to go.
[01:01:34.929 --> 01:01:35.090]  I think?
[01:01:54.042 --> 01:02:00.367]  What I don't understand is why Trump's lawyers have not raised this issue in any jurisdiction.
[01:02:00.427 --> 01:02:07.934]  In fact, the court specifically asked a Trump's lawyer to be prepared to comment on that issue based, I guess,
[01:02:08.434 --> 01:02:12.240]  So that's total sabotage.
[01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:15.084]  I mean, seriously, so many Trump lawyers have been indicted.
[01:02:15.564 --> 01:02:20.491]  People who don't know the law, when the judge asks, I want you to brief me on this, that's what you do.
[01:02:20.771 --> 01:02:24.336]  That's like first grade level understanding to not do that.
[01:02:24.396 --> 01:02:25.298]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:02:26.638 --> 01:02:29.060]  Well, look, it is possible that there's some strategy here.
[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:32.544]  I'm not a lawyer, but it would seem to me it's a legitimate action.
[01:02:32.564 --> 01:02:35.787]  It could certainly be filed in the Florida case.
[01:02:36.647 --> 01:02:43.654]  Excellent piece online about this by a couple of non-Trump-loving college law professors.
[01:02:44.234 --> 01:02:54.023]  School professors who are most definitely not fans of Donald Trump, but make a compelling case over the actual underlying legal issues.
[01:02:54.423 --> 01:02:57.606]  Trump is at the top of his game, both politically and personally.
[01:02:57.986 --> 01:02:59.107]  He knows he's winning.
[01:02:59.467 --> 01:03:09.456]  He knows that the more that the underlying issues surrounding this disastrous war in Ukraine unfold, the more that
[01:03:10.106 --> 01:03:11.206]  We're good to go.
[01:03:33.711 --> 01:03:36.573]  I have a feeling that God is going to answer our prayers.
[01:03:36.793 --> 01:03:39.875]  I have a feeling that Donald Trump is going to be back in the White House.
[01:03:40.355 --> 01:03:45.238]  I have a feeling that he's going to ride to the rescue and save this country.
[01:03:45.298 --> 01:03:46.699]  People should support him.
[01:03:46.719 --> 01:03:51.361]  Go to DonaldJTrump.com, DonaldJTrump.com, and you can make a contribution.
[01:03:51.641 --> 01:03:56.304]  If you don't want to use your credit card because you don't trust the Internet, you can mail him a check.
[01:03:56.464 --> 01:03:58.405]  But, yes, his campaign needs money.
[01:03:58.705 --> 01:04:02.908]  The Wall Street types, the billionaires, the millionaires, they're not for Donald Trump.
[01:04:03.308 --> 01:04:05.549]  He has to rely on the same people who go to the InfoWars.
[01:04:05.569 --> 01:04:12.153]  Yeah, if people ask if he's real, he's getting on average like $50 donations, and Haley's getting, you know, $100,000 donations.
[01:04:12.193 --> 01:04:13.974]  She's with the New World Order, he's not.
[01:04:15.074 --> 01:04:16.175]  That is exactly right.
[01:04:16.255 --> 01:04:21.377]  So the average person, small business person, man or woman, Trump needs your support.
[01:04:21.457 --> 01:04:28.841]  Go to DonaldJTrump.com and then go to the InfoWars store because this nitrous boost stuff is unbelievable.
[01:04:29.301 --> 01:04:30.022]  Roger, we love you.
[01:04:30.042 --> 01:04:30.822]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:04:30.862 --> 01:04:31.342]  Godspeed.
[01:04:31.362 --> 01:04:32.263]  You just get better and better.
[01:04:33.513 --> 01:04:34.354]  Many thanks, Alex.
[01:04:34.374 --> 01:04:34.974]  God bless you.
[01:04:35.174 --> 01:04:36.855]  That is a political badass, folks.
[01:04:36.896 --> 01:04:39.397]  That's why they attacked him, because he's one of our best brains.
[01:04:40.258 --> 01:04:41.679]  That's the field marshal right there.
[01:04:41.739 --> 01:04:42.239]  See you, buddy.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:43.420]  All right.
[01:04:44.101 --> 01:04:45.762]  David Icke coming up.
[01:04:45.882 --> 01:04:46.543]  I love him.
[01:04:47.683 --> 01:04:49.285]  But he says, I'm a minion now.
[01:04:49.345 --> 01:04:50.385]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:50.405 --> 01:04:50.766]  Stay with us.
[01:04:59.591 --> 01:05:00.232]  I'm not perfect.
[01:05:00.252 --> 01:05:01.052]  I'm under a lot of stress.
[01:05:01.092 --> 01:05:05.316]  But if I didn't have the supplements we have, we promote, I wouldn't be able to continue to be on air.
[01:05:05.896 --> 01:05:14.023]  And when you go to InfoWarsStore.com, you are funding the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists in an operation that the enemy admits has been the most effective at exposing them.
[01:05:14.243 --> 01:05:15.824]  Because we're fearless and we don't back down.
[01:05:16.185 --> 01:05:17.166]  We got God on our side.
[01:05:17.466 --> 01:05:18.967]  But God needs to work through you.
[01:05:19.307 --> 01:05:23.331]  You've got to make the decision to get great products you already need at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:05:23.371 --> 01:05:24.632]  And that is a 360 win.
[01:05:25.212 --> 01:05:28.175]  Nitric Boost, without even knowing, became our number three bestseller.
[01:05:28.855 --> 01:05:30.436]  Because people loved it so much.
[01:05:30.456 --> 01:05:31.416]  They had such great effects.
[01:05:31.716 --> 01:05:37.878]  Got all these natural compounds that clean out the blood, open up your arteries and veins, the capillaries, clean out your heart, your brain, everything.
[01:05:38.678 --> 01:05:40.419]  Well, we got an even better manufacturer.
[01:05:40.439 --> 01:05:45.261]  The other one was great, but one that's even better with even higher quality ingredients at a lower price.
[01:05:46.281 --> 01:05:48.703]  So I could never offer nitric boosters.
[01:05:48.723 --> 01:05:50.204]  It cost us so much to make.
[01:05:50.985 --> 01:05:53.226]  And now we can offer it for 40% off.
[01:05:53.767 --> 01:05:56.589]  Infowarsstore.com nitric boosts finally back in stock.
[01:05:56.689 --> 01:05:57.950]  40% off out of the gates.
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:22.105]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:53.285 --> 01:06:56.955]  Alright, I've been wanting to get him on for months, and we've got him.
[01:06:57.476 --> 01:06:58.359]  Best-selling author.
[01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:00.951]  We're good to go.
[01:07:28.453 --> 01:07:29.314]  We're good to go.
[01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:53.708]  I'm not censoring a damn thing I say.
[01:07:53.728 --> 01:07:56.749]  I'm more hardcore than I've ever been.
[01:07:56.769 --> 01:08:01.611]  And you've got Joe Rogan coming out saying, Alex Jones is right about everything.
[01:08:01.691 --> 01:08:02.992]  New world order with Aaron Rodgers.
[01:08:03.012 --> 01:08:03.772]  We've got to stop him.
[01:08:04.233 --> 01:08:06.353]  I mean, I know Joe for 25 years.
[01:08:06.373 --> 01:08:07.414]  I know he's not an operative.
[01:08:07.494 --> 01:08:10.955]  He is waking up completely, just like David Icke did 35 years ago.
[01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:25.805]  And so that's where I'm at on this, and I turned down the $10 million a year contracts and the book deals to be the new Rush Limbaugh, Roger Ailes, Fox News shows, because they were straight up, you're going to work for us now, you're going to do what we say.
[01:08:25.845 --> 01:08:26.065]  No.
[01:08:26.706 --> 01:08:31.171]  But if somebody says, here, you're banned off this, and now you can counter everybody that's been attacking you,
[01:08:31.852 --> 01:08:33.993]  Then, I mean, I'm going to use it, okay?
[01:08:34.273 --> 01:08:39.116]  Now, that doesn't mean I'm going to put my knee pads on and, you know, give Elon Musk a blowjob.
[01:08:39.816 --> 01:08:43.237]  So, I'm going to let you run with this, and I don't really want to have a debate.
[01:08:43.277 --> 01:08:44.978]  I called it a debate because that makes it more interesting.
[01:08:47.364 --> 01:08:48.425]  We're good to go.
[01:09:11.508 --> 01:09:16.450]  And then I'm trying to get you on saying, hey, I don't think this while I'm being called this minion thing.
[01:09:16.590 --> 01:09:17.350]  It's a little hurtful.
[01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:19.271]  I'm not mad at you because I respect you as a friend.
[01:09:19.331 --> 01:09:19.751]  I love you.
[01:09:20.931 --> 01:09:22.012]  And I know that's mutual.
[01:09:22.092 --> 01:09:22.832]  You know I'm real.
[01:09:23.252 --> 01:09:25.273]  But I've not been seduced by the dark side.
[01:09:25.313 --> 01:09:28.554]  I'm not dancing to the fiddle of Elon Musk.
[01:09:28.894 --> 01:09:29.354]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:09:31.695 --> 01:09:31.995]  Right.
[01:09:32.155 --> 01:09:37.777]  Well, first of all, I'm not saying that people shouldn't use Twitter X. Of course they should use it.
[01:09:37.937 --> 01:09:38.537]  I use it.
[01:09:39.187 --> 01:09:39.987]  We're good to go.
[01:10:09.537 --> 01:10:14.240]  When I started out, there was no alternative media, just one or two people.
[01:10:15.441 --> 01:10:18.243]  And I watched the alternative media emerge.
[01:10:19.423 --> 01:10:37.675]  And although it was still seeing left and right to a certain extent, there was a lot of streetwise people who were realizing that left and right is a puppet show.
[01:10:38.869 --> 01:10:52.471]  And that the real decisions that are working through left and right are being made by deeper levels than the left-right political level, what I call the global cult.
[01:10:54.032 --> 01:10:58.332]  And creating a dialectic where they play the two sides of golf against what you pioneered exposing.
[01:10:59.312 --> 01:11:07.974]  Yeah, but one of the expressions of the global cult, a level down, is what people call the deep state.
[01:11:09.088 --> 01:11:19.112]  So when you look at a situation, maybe we can get into elements of the Putin interview in regard to this later.
[01:11:20.913 --> 01:11:26.475]  You see at the left and right level, we're left, they're the liberals.
[01:11:26.996 --> 01:11:27.956]  We're against the liberals.
[01:11:29.537 --> 01:11:32.798]  But you go a step deeper into the rabbit hole, into the web.
[01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:34.030]  We're good to go.
[01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.371]  I think?
[01:12:03.098 --> 01:12:04.678]  And there was a lot that I agreed with.
[01:12:04.718 --> 01:12:13.500]  I've been pointing out for years and years and years that NATO was poking him in the chest to get him to invade Ukraine.
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:22.361]  But if you look at it from this level, you've got a Putin interview with Tucker Carlson.
[01:12:23.081 --> 01:12:26.042]  And the response is, look, the liberals don't want it.
[01:12:26.102 --> 01:12:27.142]  Look at the liberals.
[01:12:27.522 --> 01:12:28.502]  It's great, isn't it?
[01:12:29.022 --> 01:12:32.303]  But go deeper and look at the bigger agenda.
[01:12:33.357 --> 01:12:43.263]  And that is the dismantling of Western society and the dismantling of Western power in the world.
[01:12:44.284 --> 01:12:49.727]  That's why they've put a moron in the White House for the last four bloody years or whatever it is.
[01:12:50.327 --> 01:12:50.888]  Three years.
[01:12:52.249 --> 01:12:54.650]  And that's why they've opened the southern border.
[01:12:55.731 --> 01:12:57.792]  That's why they've opened the borders to Europe.
[01:12:58.792 --> 01:13:02.855]  Because they are dismantling Western culture.
[01:13:04.012 --> 01:13:10.070]  And what is happening is the power in the world is moving eastward.
[01:13:11.008 --> 01:13:19.951]  It's moving to China, and it's moving to their alliance with Russia and the East in general, and Iran's part of that as well, and the BRICS.
[01:13:20.251 --> 01:13:23.512]  And the globalists have to know their policies are doing that.
[01:13:23.592 --> 01:13:25.433]  And just to be fair then, let's interject here.
[01:13:25.833 --> 01:13:34.775]  I'm not the apologist for Elon Musk here, but what I'm saying is he's come out massively against the open borders, says it's to destroy Western culture as well.
[01:13:34.815 --> 01:13:36.296]  He sounds like David Icke and Alex Jones.
[01:13:37.375 --> 01:13:37.935]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:38.076 --> 01:13:41.058]  But it's easy to... Words are easy in telling you what you want to hear, mate.
[01:13:41.318 --> 01:13:43.019]  I'll get more into Musk as we go along.
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.861]  The questions that are not being asked that should be.
[01:13:46.662 --> 01:13:52.366]  But anyway, what I'm saying is that you've got this movement eastward in terms of power, quite demonstrably.
[01:13:52.386 --> 01:13:53.727]  That's what the BRICS thing is all about.
[01:13:54.648 --> 01:14:03.455]  And so, over a period of time, because you're coming from this cult level, not left and right, the cult level that works through left and right.
[01:14:04.415 --> 01:14:04.556]  So...
[01:14:05.786 --> 01:14:29.404]  Over this period, this cult has been orchestrating the transfer of global production massively out of America, American corporations and American jobs, and Europe too, into China and the East to give them power over the supply chain in so many areas, even basic things.
[01:14:30.154 --> 01:14:38.780]  And Taiwan is this real global center for things like superconductors and what have you.
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:41.522]  Mainly the chips for AI are almost all made there.
[01:14:42.563 --> 01:14:55.111]  Yeah, so if China gets that, and that's the plan in the end, then they completely dominate global society in so many ways.
[01:14:56.052 --> 01:14:59.294]  And so if you look at the Putin interview...
[01:15:00.655 --> 01:15:03.879]  And you look at it not from left, right, or the liberals don't like it.
[01:15:04.579 --> 01:15:05.881]  You look at the cult level.
[01:15:07.062 --> 01:15:18.915]  It suits the cult that the pushbackers in America and Europe and the West in general see Putin as some kind of hero.
[01:15:20.056 --> 01:15:22.038]  Because what was he doing in the...
[01:15:23.527 --> 01:15:28.148]  In the interview with Tucker Carlson, he was pushing China.
[01:15:28.308 --> 01:15:31.088]  You shouldn't not stop negotiating with China.
[01:15:31.108 --> 01:15:33.949]  Oh, China's foreign policy is not aggressive.
[01:15:34.389 --> 01:15:39.250]  You tell the people of Africa and South America that it's not aggressive.
[01:15:39.870 --> 01:15:46.311]  So it suits that cult level for Putin to be a hero.
[01:15:46.551 --> 01:15:49.172]  I'm not saying he didn't say some right things about Putin.
[01:15:49.807 --> 01:15:50.627]  About Ukraine.
[01:15:50.948 --> 01:16:07.016]  By the way, David, I totally agree with you, and that was the big area, was him saying America's been surpassed, China's the way to go, Xi Jinping's not expansionary, but we know that the globalists set up communist China, put them in power in 49, transferred all the stuff to them.
[01:16:07.036 --> 01:16:10.918]  Now, nine years ago, they claimed there was a split, and this is all going on.
[01:16:11.298 --> 01:16:14.520]  Take us to the end of your extrapolation, because I respect your view.
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:18.662]  So what you've got, as I've said so many times...
[01:16:19.531 --> 01:16:22.233]  China is the blueprint for the world.
[01:16:23.394 --> 01:16:30.120]  What's happening in China in terms of control and suppression and the digital concentration... It's the model.
[01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:33.702]  It's the model, and that was set up to be the model.
[01:16:34.123 --> 01:16:41.208]  So what I'm saying is, you know, if you look at it at left and right, then you can see it a certain way, and most people have.
[01:16:41.729 --> 01:16:47.974]  But if you look at it from this cult big picture level, then what you have is the pushbackers...
[01:16:48.954 --> 01:16:53.740]  When he's absolutely in bed with the Chinese, that the pushbacker stays a danger.
[01:17:02.826 --> 01:17:06.328]  And Putin, and Putin, and we're having a discussion here.
[01:17:06.928 --> 01:17:09.370]  Usually I have you on, you just run because I love hearing you, but I want to add some things.
[01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:15.934]  We have Putin praising Elon Musk, saying he's an amazing, wonderful person, and Elon won't talk about China.
[01:17:16.354 --> 01:17:17.375]  I was waiting for you to bring that up.
[01:17:17.415 --> 01:17:21.137]  That's the one big thing I see Elon is up to there.
[01:17:21.517 --> 01:17:23.739]  You talk about Neuralink too, but it's the China thing.
[01:17:25.086 --> 01:17:28.847]  Yeah, well, we can get into Musk as we go along.
[01:17:28.867 --> 01:17:34.168]  But the point I'm making here is that the power is moving east.
[01:17:34.809 --> 01:17:39.690]  And the more that... Sure, but my point is, David, you say it wasn't minion.
[01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:43.371]  I know ma'am means, you know, mainstream alternative media.
[01:17:43.691 --> 01:17:44.591]  But there were little comments.
[01:17:44.631 --> 01:17:46.312]  I don't have the tweets in front of me, the X things.
[01:17:46.332 --> 01:17:48.292]  But it was like little groveling people.
[01:17:48.552 --> 01:17:49.432]  Let me just finish.
[01:17:49.492 --> 01:17:51.393]  I'm saying you're exposing, hey...
[01:17:51.793 --> 01:17:56.915]  I'm talking about Elon being with China and Putin too, so I'm doing this every day just like you are.
[01:17:57.255 --> 01:18:09.559]  So when you say that, oh, I'm changing, because you put my name on there, I'm trying to be straight up with you, when you're saying I'm changing what I'm saying, I don't think you're tuning in because I'm saying the same stuff you're saying, buddy, and I agree with you.
[01:18:11.379 --> 01:18:13.920]  Alex, it's not about you, mate, and it's not about me.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.741]  It's about what the hell is happening in the world.
[01:18:17.641 --> 01:18:20.662]  That's the point I'm making.
[01:18:21.261 --> 01:18:37.967]  Now, if we move to Elon Musk, the thing that I've been observing is that so many things that he would have been questioned about, you know, let's personalize this.
[01:18:38.027 --> 01:18:41.148]  I'm talking about the mainstream alternative media in general.
[01:18:42.288 --> 01:18:49.311]  Before he took over Twitter, turned it into X, the same things are not being questioned in the same way.
[01:18:50.518 --> 01:19:17.598]  I mean, you know, the foundation of human control, where we're going, is connecting the human brain to artificial intelligence, not least via the cloud, the electromagnetic cloud of 5G, 6G, 7G to come, which is being generated by the towers, but fundamentally, if you want it global...
[01:19:18.530 --> 01:19:18.950]  We're good to go.
[01:19:18.970 --> 01:19:19.210]  I think?
[01:19:48.084 --> 01:19:50.345]  So this cloud is fundamental.
[01:19:51.225 --> 01:20:02.528]  And SpaceX, Elon Musk's SpaceX, is leading the way in putting up low orbit satellites to beam this stuff at the Earth.
[01:20:02.768 --> 01:20:08.229]  And so the question is, if you are against this new world order,
[01:20:08.929 --> 01:20:10.069]  We're good to go.
[01:20:38.263 --> 01:20:41.687]  From people like NASA and the Pentagon.
[01:20:42.528 --> 01:20:58.145]  Only a few months ago, they were awarded a contract by the Pentagon to take over and create something called Starshield, which is the military government communication system version of Starlink.
[01:20:59.139 --> 01:21:01.621]  Now, these things should be questioned.
[01:21:02.061 --> 01:21:11.908]  When Tucker Carlson interviews Elon Musk, when Joe Rogan interviews Elon Musk, they should be asking, how do you square this?
[01:21:12.769 --> 01:21:19.654]  Now, the connection to the cloud is meant to be via chipping.
[01:21:20.775 --> 01:21:27.980]  And here we have Neuralink from someone who says AI could be the end of humanity.
[01:21:28.951 --> 01:21:32.013]  And yet it turns out more and more AI stuff.
[01:21:33.073 --> 01:21:36.135]  The Neuralink has just had the first human trial.
[01:21:36.215 --> 01:21:48.541]  Now, I think it's a bit of a kind of diversion because the real connection to the cloud is through nanotechnology, not least that which was in the and is in the fake vaccine.
[01:21:48.981 --> 01:21:54.043]  But it's still going down the same road of chipping.
[01:21:54.063 --> 01:21:56.425]  Okay, so David, you're a great...
[01:21:58.099 --> 01:22:06.666]  You're a guy that does a great job lecturing, and I agree with everything you're saying, but let me just interject.
[01:22:06.686 --> 01:22:07.326]  You're bringing this up.
[01:22:08.427 --> 01:22:11.189]  I'm just making my point, mate.
[01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:13.111]  You're getting about 80% of the time.
[01:22:13.731 --> 01:22:19.516]  So all I'm saying is, and I'm not trying to be mean to you, but I actually... I don't care, mate.
[01:22:19.716 --> 01:22:21.778]  It's okay.
[01:22:21.798 --> 01:22:23.639]  You know, hey, we're friends, aren't we?
[01:22:23.839 --> 01:22:24.279]  I like you.
[01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:24.660]  You like me.
[01:22:26.677 --> 01:22:27.618]  Just go ahead with what you said.
[01:22:27.638 --> 01:22:31.843]  No, but I'm going to ask you, do you think I'm an agent of the New World Order?
[01:22:31.883 --> 01:22:36.949]  No, the point is, as I've said many times, you don't have to be.
[01:22:38.665 --> 01:22:42.169]  A knowing agent of the company.
[01:22:42.189 --> 01:22:43.830]  But a useful idiot.
[01:22:43.911 --> 01:22:56.664]  If you have a certain mentality and you focus, for instance, on left-right politics, and they're the people that get the promotion and the numbers...
[01:22:57.325 --> 01:22:59.726]  Then you don't have to be part of it.
[01:22:59.786 --> 01:23:01.687]  You just have to be... No, I agree.
[01:23:01.707 --> 01:23:03.828]  And I'm the guy that coined the term left-right paradigm.
[01:23:04.368 --> 01:23:10.531]  What I'm trying to say here is if I saw the left waking up and taking on the globalist, I would support that.
[01:23:10.571 --> 01:23:11.352]  It's not a leftist thing.
[01:23:11.392 --> 01:23:12.292]  It's a populist awakening.
[01:23:12.652 --> 01:23:17.174]  And I see the major beachhead worldwide of populism being called right-wing.
[01:23:17.554 --> 01:23:19.175]  So that just identifies that.
[01:23:19.235 --> 01:23:20.496]  But I totally get what you're saying.
[01:23:21.256 --> 01:23:22.537]  But here's what I wanted to agree with you on.
[01:23:23.257 --> 01:23:24.338]  I just wanted to add that.
[01:23:24.398 --> 01:23:25.759]  I'm not an apologist for Elon Musk.
[01:23:25.779 --> 01:23:27.079]  I've just been looking at all the angles of it.
[01:23:27.099 --> 01:23:27.320]  Go ahead.
[01:23:54.341 --> 01:24:07.447]  Yeah, well, as I was saying, his company is pushing the way, at least popularizing the concept of a brain chip connecting to artificial intelligence.
[01:24:08.347 --> 01:24:14.330]  And if you connect to artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence becomes your mind.
[01:24:14.910 --> 01:24:17.831]  And then you've got another agenda.
[01:24:18.292 --> 01:24:22.353]  These are all WEF agendas, by the way, which is...
[01:24:24.585 --> 01:24:31.988]  Autonomous vehicles, where the computer will decide where you can and cannot go, not your personal choice.
[01:24:32.608 --> 01:24:34.669]  And so you have Tesla.
[01:24:34.729 --> 01:24:41.652]  So what I'm saying is, you look at the companies and the things that are done that he's fronting up.
[01:24:42.541 --> 01:24:44.821]  And these need to be questioned.
[01:24:45.322 --> 01:24:51.463]  And since he took over TwitterX, in very large areas, they're ceasing to be questioned.
[01:24:51.543 --> 01:24:52.783]  I'll give you an example.
[01:24:52.823 --> 01:24:53.563]  No, I think that's fair.
[01:24:53.583 --> 01:24:54.543]  I don't want you to make your point.
[01:24:54.944 --> 01:24:59.164]  But then after you're done, because I don't want to forget this, let's just say you're completely right.
[01:24:59.764 --> 01:25:04.405]  That's why we have you here, because we're not censoring, and I respect you, and we really like you a lot, David.
[01:25:04.866 --> 01:25:05.986]  You're a little perturbed with me.
[01:25:08.215 --> 01:25:09.696]  Let's say he is a terrible guy.
[01:25:10.177 --> 01:25:11.818]  What is their plan with him then?
[01:25:11.838 --> 01:25:14.000]  And why are they doing this?
[01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:15.861]  Why are they having him act like he's on our side?
[01:25:16.161 --> 01:25:20.565]  That shows me we're really winning big time if they're having to send him in to try to co-op things.
[01:25:20.585 --> 01:25:21.145]  But just go ahead.
[01:25:21.465 --> 01:25:21.665]  Right.
[01:25:21.706 --> 01:25:23.407]  Well, yeah, I'll come to that in a second.
[01:25:24.768 --> 01:25:25.388]  And I want to.
[01:25:25.468 --> 01:25:27.150]  But I just want to make this point.
[01:25:27.690 --> 01:25:28.851]  There's a Dutch activist.
[01:25:28.911 --> 01:25:30.292]  I'm not picking on her.
[01:25:30.332 --> 01:25:31.353]  It's just a good example.
[01:25:31.393 --> 01:25:33.615]  This is something that is across the board.
[01:25:34.255 --> 01:25:37.898]  There's a Dutch activist called Eva Vlandingerbroek.
[01:25:38.575 --> 01:25:38.775]  I think?
[01:25:58.999 --> 01:26:07.023]  But the same Eva today is like a lovesick teenager in relation to Elon Musk.
[01:26:07.223 --> 01:26:08.664]  Oh, yeah, Elon this, Elon that.
[01:26:08.764 --> 01:26:11.585]  Elon drops a tweet supporting one of hers.
[01:26:11.605 --> 01:26:12.786]  Oh, thank you, Elon.
[01:26:13.326 --> 01:26:16.308]  This is not where we should be going.
[01:26:16.748 --> 01:26:18.769]  We shouldn't be eulogizing anyone.
[01:26:18.809 --> 01:26:23.751]  We should be dispassionately, calmly looking at everything.
[01:26:24.372 --> 01:26:28.734]  So let's just look at the AI agenda.
[01:26:29.987 --> 01:26:31.148]  And how this fits in.
[01:26:32.209 --> 01:26:42.158]  You've got people, your Bill Gateses and your Klaus Schwabs, and what they're doing is going hard sell.
[01:26:43.039 --> 01:26:49.304]  Hard sell AI, connecting AI to the human brain and human genetics.
[01:26:49.664 --> 01:26:51.065]  That's what needs to happen.
[01:26:52.066 --> 01:26:57.291]  But, of course, there's a vast number of what I call pushbackers,
[01:26:57.932 --> 01:27:02.813]  And by the way, Bill Gates came out three months ago and said, we've got to stop the hard sell.
[01:27:03.633 --> 01:27:04.534]  He actually said that.
[01:27:04.714 --> 01:27:05.894]  And Elon Musk does the soft sell.
[01:27:19.739 --> 01:27:21.901]  He is saying, oh, I'm worried about AI.
[01:27:21.921 --> 01:27:23.142]  Oh, it's very terrible.
[01:27:23.222 --> 01:27:25.144]  It could be the end of humanity.
[01:27:25.624 --> 01:27:29.728]  And then continues to push the AI agenda.
[01:27:30.068 --> 01:27:32.951]  But it's not too bad.
[01:27:32.971 --> 01:27:37.075]  It can't be as bad because Elon's doing it and he owns Twitter and he's letting people...
[01:27:38.436 --> 01:27:39.336]  Back on Twitter.
[01:27:39.876 --> 01:27:46.580]  And these are the things I'm saying that, you know, we've got to keep questioning these things.
[01:27:46.941 --> 01:27:50.883]  They did five years of total censorship and it failed.
[01:27:51.303 --> 01:27:58.628]  So they said go to Plan B and bring in a co-opter to create a false dialectic of Elon on one end of freedom and the hard sellers on the other.
[01:27:58.968 --> 01:28:02.570]  And you're saying now we're missing the whole paradigm over there because they put us into a small window.
[01:28:03.576 --> 01:28:07.358]  What I'm saying is, look at the outcome.
[01:28:08.479 --> 01:28:11.320]  What is the outcome of the hard sell?
[01:28:12.101 --> 01:28:14.622]  What is the outcome of the soft sell?
[01:28:15.403 --> 01:28:18.564]  At the end of those roads is the same thing.
[01:28:19.405 --> 01:28:23.687]  Humans connected to artificial intelligence.
[01:28:24.368 --> 01:28:25.708]  And what you're trying to do is pull
[01:28:27.361 --> 01:28:31.783]  The people that are resisting the hard sell, you're trying to pull them in.
[01:28:32.383 --> 01:28:33.804]  All right, stay there.
[01:28:33.824 --> 01:28:34.864]  Stay there, David.
[01:28:34.884 --> 01:28:38.365]  You're making your points, but I agree with most of what you're saying.
[01:28:38.385 --> 01:28:43.988]  But you've made statements and things, so I'm not bad for interjecting and bringing things up and telling you I'm saying the same thing I do.
[01:28:44.028 --> 01:28:44.928]  I'm not bothered.
[01:28:45.228 --> 01:28:45.569]  Good, good.
[01:28:45.589 --> 01:28:46.751]  I do the same thing I do every day.
[01:28:47.112 --> 01:28:47.573]  You're on.
[01:28:47.673 --> 01:28:48.574]  I love it.
[01:28:48.895 --> 01:28:49.656]  And that's what we're doing.
[01:28:49.737 --> 01:28:50.638]  So I'm not ma'am.
[01:28:51.139 --> 01:28:51.901]  I'm not part of ma'am.
[01:28:51.941 --> 01:28:53.103]  Let's just get that straight.
[01:28:53.564 --> 01:28:53.824]  All right.
[01:28:54.445 --> 01:28:55.447]  We've got David Icahn with us.
[01:28:55.467 --> 01:28:56.008]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:56.028 --> 01:28:56.689]  We'll talk about this more.
[01:28:56.709 --> 01:28:57.270]  It's fascinating.
[01:28:59.022 --> 01:29:01.584]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalist.
[01:29:01.944 --> 01:29:04.306]  And people can't identify who's a patriot and who isn't.
[01:29:04.627 --> 01:29:07.769]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalist.
[01:29:07.829 --> 01:29:10.732]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.
[01:29:10.992 --> 01:29:21.561]  That's why I designed this amazing 1776 red, white, and blue Gadsden flag shirt so you can support the InfoWar and meet like-minded people everywhere when you wear it.
[01:29:21.681 --> 01:29:27.305]  When you wear these shirts, it creates an amazing amount of energy and it's quite the adventure.
[01:29:27.605 --> 01:29:37.652]  So get your 1776 shirt right now at Infowarsstore.com and get your Team Humanity Infowars Limited Edition shirt right now at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:29:38.052 --> 01:29:43.295]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is antithetical, the complete opposite of what the globalists are pushing.
[01:29:43.555 --> 01:29:51.339]  So get both the Team Humanity and the 1776 Gadsden Snake Shirts Limited Edition at Infowarsstore.com right now.
[01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:55.522]  Spread the word, meet like-minded people, and fund the 1776 revolution worldwide.
[01:29:58.826 --> 01:30:02.352]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[01:30:02.732 --> 01:30:09.763]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[01:30:09.944 --> 01:30:11.947]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[01:30:12.127 --> 01:30:13.169]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:13.910]  He loved the idea.
[01:30:14.230 --> 01:30:17.754]  What would you call the debate and discussion about a pro-human future?
[01:30:17.774 --> 01:30:18.655]  Just Team Humanity?
[01:30:18.735 --> 01:30:19.596]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[01:30:19.756 --> 01:30:20.197]  Absolutely.
[01:30:20.517 --> 01:30:21.919]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[01:30:21.979 --> 01:30:25.422]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[01:30:25.663 --> 01:30:33.091]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to give InfoWars on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[01:30:33.371 --> 01:30:45.075]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a revolution against the globalists, and it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[01:30:45.355 --> 01:30:46.676]  We're told humans are the problem.
[01:30:46.696 --> 01:30:47.696]  We're told we're killing the Earth.
[01:30:47.976 --> 01:30:52.238]  We're told all this garbage so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[01:30:52.538 --> 01:30:53.258]  We're not going to do that.
[01:30:53.518 --> 01:30:58.140]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at infowarsstore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[01:30:59.119 --> 01:31:05.641]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the globalist agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[01:31:05.701 --> 01:31:19.865]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections, masquerading as vaccines.
[01:31:20.025 --> 01:31:24.927]  It is so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives oblivious.
[01:31:26.338 --> 01:31:29.039]  And you realize, Ingrid Stodblast, it equals death.
[01:31:31.138 --> 01:31:51.151]  People are starting to really understand how serious things are and that's a hard thing to do because to wake up to a disturbing reality and realize that we're in the middle of a giant biological weapons war against humanity and that there's mass sterilization that's already taking place and they're cutting off all the major energy sources is really hard to deal with but it's the reality.
[01:31:51.691 --> 01:31:53.753]  Facing it is our only chance to turn this around.
[01:31:54.173 --> 01:31:55.874]  This stuff's about to get really, really nasty.
[01:31:56.274 --> 01:31:56.895]  Infowars.com
[01:31:58.843 --> 01:32:02.967]  InfoWarsStore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.
[01:32:03.568 --> 01:32:05.510]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[01:32:05.530 --> 01:32:07.292]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[01:32:07.572 --> 01:32:09.814]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[01:32:10.054 --> 01:32:10.775]  Hey, what's better?
[01:32:10.875 --> 01:32:11.376]  Knockout.
[01:32:11.716 --> 01:32:12.297]  What's better?
[01:32:13.057 --> 01:32:13.538]  Down and out.
[01:32:13.798 --> 01:32:14.279]  What's better?
[01:32:14.339 --> 01:32:15.940]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep eggs?
[01:32:16.601 --> 01:32:21.526]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[01:32:22.210 --> 01:32:25.794]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[01:32:26.174 --> 01:32:27.475]  That's how our bodies work.
[01:32:27.495 --> 01:32:28.416]  They're all very diverse.
[01:32:28.817 --> 01:32:39.006]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night Sleep.
[01:32:39.747 --> 01:32:45.151]  This is a great formula full of amazing safe compounds that give you deeper, cleaner, restful sleep.
[01:32:45.371 --> 01:32:49.555]  And it's in stock, available right now, of 25% off out of the gates.
[01:32:49.915 --> 01:32:51.596]  So get your InfoWars MD.
[01:32:51.817 --> 01:32:57.741]  Good night's sleep today at InfoWars.com.
[01:33:00.143 --> 01:33:06.028]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.636 --> 01:33:22.539]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:23.239 --> 01:33:28.524]  Live from Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:28.844 --> 01:33:34.969]  All right, I get David Icke's point about the new Hollywood is Elon Musk.
[01:33:35.908 --> 01:33:43.690]  But the system knew they were failing and that all the independent media just a year ago had all the biggest audiences despite the censorship.
[01:33:43.730 --> 01:33:44.350]  It was failing.
[01:33:45.151 --> 01:33:49.972]  So if you go with David's argument, let's just do this for, you know, not devil's advocate, but David Icke advocate.
[01:33:51.512 --> 01:33:57.734]  They said, okay, send in Elon Musk and then give them limited freedom there and then we'll be in control of the narrative again.
[01:33:59.015 --> 01:34:02.236]  If that's the truth, well, it shows the system's failing.
[01:34:02.316 --> 01:34:03.676]  And I remember you on my show saying,
[01:34:04.804 --> 01:34:07.825]  I mean, like 2000 and... I mean, you've been coming on my show.
[01:34:07.845 --> 01:34:12.286]  The first time I interviewed you was like 1997 or something.
[01:34:13.166 --> 01:34:20.087]  But I remember you in the early 2000s saying, part of my download is your download has been proven really accurate, so I respect you.
[01:34:21.768 --> 01:34:26.128]  But then I think you can't look at what other people are doing and with a wide net and say, oh, they've been co-opted.
[01:34:26.188 --> 01:34:28.429]  No, it's just people being positive about a breach in the wall.
[01:34:29.309 --> 01:34:30.049]  You know, whoever blew it.
[01:34:30.089 --> 01:34:33.250]  You're like, I see a global awakening happening
[01:34:33.914 --> 01:34:39.717]  Starting in 2016, they try to suppress it, and then by 2025, we're going to decide where we're going.
[01:34:39.737 --> 01:34:43.078]  If we make the right decision, I'm paraphrasing, we can beat them by 2030.
[01:34:43.479 --> 01:34:44.659]  If not, they'll still get beaten.
[01:34:44.699 --> 01:34:46.340]  I mean, that's what you were saying then.
[01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:47.301]  I can dig the clubs up.
[01:34:48.001 --> 01:34:52.023]  And I don't think Trump's perfect, or anybody's perfect, but my point is, you nailed that.
[01:34:52.963 --> 01:34:56.766]  And I go to the grocery store, and five years ago would get screamed at.
[01:34:57.246 --> 01:34:59.968]  I'd shake 30, 40 hands, but I'd be screamed at two or three times.
[01:35:00.608 --> 01:35:02.490]  It's been a year and a half I've been screamed at twice.
[01:35:03.250 --> 01:35:09.054]  And everywhere I go to pump gas or walk the dog or, you know, go anywhere, all I see is positive.
[01:35:09.434 --> 01:35:12.396]  It doesn't mean I'm perfect, but, I mean, I know I'm real.
[01:35:13.037 --> 01:35:15.158]  And I just see a huge awakening happening.
[01:35:15.518 --> 01:35:17.520]  And that goes to your point, well, they're going to need to co-opt it.
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:19.241]  So how would they strike back?
[01:35:19.301 --> 01:35:20.182]  It'd be something like months.
[01:35:20.202 --> 01:35:20.502]  Yeah, but...
[01:35:21.283 --> 01:35:25.147]  The thing is, Alex, you're kind of missing my point.
[01:35:26.248 --> 01:35:28.310]  I'm not saying there's not a global awakening.
[01:35:28.450 --> 01:35:33.255]  When I started out in 1990, you couldn't fill a phone booth.
[01:35:33.915 --> 01:35:35.637]  David, I'm not missing what you said.
[01:35:35.697 --> 01:35:38.861]  I said there's a global awakening, and you're saying Musk is trying to co-opt it.
[01:35:39.101 --> 01:35:39.942]  That's what I just said.
[01:35:40.822 --> 01:35:43.463]  Okay, well, I misunderstood you then.
[01:35:43.543 --> 01:35:47.724]  But the thing is that I'm not saying there's not a global awakening.
[01:35:47.784 --> 01:35:48.224]  There is.
[01:35:48.885 --> 01:35:55.947]  But, you know, if you are this cult and you see this happening, you want to take it into a cult.
[01:35:55.967 --> 01:35:56.827]  That's what I said.
[01:35:56.887 --> 01:35:58.828]  I said, are you saying that's what they see?
[01:35:58.848 --> 01:36:01.809]  Stop making it personal.
[01:36:01.889 --> 01:36:04.630]  And let's just have a discussion about what's going on.
[01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:07.251]  So the question then is...
[01:36:09.165 --> 01:36:14.629]  What happened when Elon Musk purchased Twitter?
[01:36:14.890 --> 01:36:16.691]  OK, because that was the change.
[01:36:17.252 --> 01:36:17.992]  That was the change.
[01:36:18.092 --> 01:36:30.022]  That's when so many people in the alternative media started eulogizing him instead of questioning him and exposing him, as they would have done if he hadn't bought Twitter.
[01:36:30.942 --> 01:36:35.266]  So he's bought Twitter and he puts out the Twitter files.
[01:36:36.309 --> 01:36:47.112]  And he shows that Twitter's operation, who could post and what could be posted, was basically completely controlled by the deep state.
[01:36:48.113 --> 01:36:57.156]  And if you said to people, was Twitter controlled by the deep state before Elon Musk, they'd say, yeah, all the Twitter files, they showed it.
[01:36:57.376 --> 01:36:57.616]  Yeah.
[01:36:58.316 --> 01:36:58.636]  Okay.
[01:36:59.576 --> 01:37:04.678]  So the deep state was in a position that was exactly what it wanted then.
[01:37:05.539 --> 01:37:06.319]  We're good to go.
[01:37:06.339 --> 01:37:06.500]  I think?
[01:37:35.313 --> 01:37:41.040]  This man is serving the agenda of the cult and the World Economic Forum, etc.
[01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:46.807]  They've stopped doing it in the way they would have done had he not bought and run Twitter.
[01:37:47.327 --> 01:37:48.209]  The guy's still...
[01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:50.381]  No, you're right.
[01:38:11.499 --> 01:38:13.540]  Well, where it's going, in part, in relation to TwitterX...
[01:38:38.013 --> 01:38:42.517]  ...is described by Linda Iaccarino, the CEO.
[01:38:42.737 --> 01:38:44.338]  By the way, to interrupt you, start over.
[01:38:44.398 --> 01:38:44.838]  You're right.
[01:38:45.019 --> 01:38:45.499]  I'm wrong.
[01:38:45.959 --> 01:38:46.640]  I didn't know this.
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:49.482]  He just, a few days ago, called for carbon tax.
[01:38:49.522 --> 01:38:50.663]  The video you put out was old.
[01:38:50.983 --> 01:38:51.483]  You're right.
[01:38:51.523 --> 01:38:51.864]  He did it.
[01:38:51.984 --> 01:38:52.724]  There it is right there.
[01:38:52.744 --> 01:38:53.125]  David Icke.
[01:38:53.205 --> 01:38:53.645]  That's right.
[01:38:53.665 --> 01:38:54.306]  Put it back on screen.
[01:38:54.946 --> 01:38:55.426]  Start over, David.
[01:38:55.466 --> 01:38:56.547]  Yeah, he did.
[01:38:56.567 --> 01:39:06.535]  So, Linda Iaccarino, who's got very major World Economic Forum connections, starts talking about
[01:39:07.219 --> 01:39:07.759]  Shadow banning.
[01:39:37.845 --> 01:39:38.466]  We're good to go.
[01:39:38.486 --> 01:39:38.826]  I think?
[01:40:01.686 --> 01:40:05.409]  Who was clearly shadow banned by the numbers that they get.
[01:40:05.429 --> 01:40:09.433]  And so this is the start of a slippery slope.
[01:40:09.893 --> 01:40:15.679]  But the point is, it's not Elon Musk or Twitter or whatever.
[01:40:15.699 --> 01:40:17.801]  It's how that works.
[01:40:18.692 --> 01:40:19.453]  We're good to go.
[01:40:38.954 --> 01:40:39.515]  I think, yeah.
[01:40:56.886 --> 01:41:03.513]  And Brett Weinstein's interviewed on Tucker Carlson as if he's some kind of expert and activist on COVID.
[01:41:04.034 --> 01:41:08.819]  And this is the man who bought every aspect of COVID virtually.
[01:41:09.340 --> 01:41:13.625]  And there's a video of him during the fake pandemic.
[01:41:14.716 --> 01:41:23.442]  Describing how he wore a scarf around his neck so he could pull it up over his face every time he answered the door.
[01:41:23.722 --> 01:41:31.267]  And now we're being told that this guy is supposed to be the COVID activist that gets the massive numbers on Tucker Carlson.
[01:41:31.667 --> 01:41:35.710]  What about all the people that were calling it out in 2020, Tucker?
[01:41:35.750 --> 01:41:38.411]  Well, I was and you were, but David, let me just stop you there.
[01:41:38.431 --> 01:41:41.533]  And I actually wrote some notes on this and I forgot the house.
[01:41:41.553 --> 01:41:42.254]  This is one of my points.
[01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:56.365]  Brett Weinstein, when he went on Tucker, admitted he was wrong and said that it's all a lie, there's a global government takeover, we're being invaded, and the borders are open and the New World Order is real, and there's a global government that we need to... I don't know if you watched the full interview.
[01:41:56.425 --> 01:41:57.547]  I bet Tucker wants to interview you.
[01:41:57.567 --> 01:41:58.828]  I mean, so...
[01:41:59.489 --> 01:42:00.270]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:42:17.792 --> 01:42:19.534]  Yes, we do.
[01:42:20.094 --> 01:42:23.176]  But where are the people that called it out at the time?
[01:42:23.216 --> 01:42:25.137]  Where's their promotion?
[01:42:25.398 --> 01:42:33.623]  The ones who could see it at the start because of the research they'd done before that didn't buy it, like Brett Weinstein, because they'd done the research.
[01:42:33.763 --> 01:42:34.284]  I'll say this.
[01:42:34.304 --> 01:42:37.706]  We're having a debate.
[01:42:37.746 --> 01:42:38.487]  No, just a second.
[01:42:39.287 --> 01:42:44.311]  You're picking up that I'm saying that Tucker Carlson is a bad person.
[01:42:44.931 --> 01:42:46.012]  I'm not saying that.
[01:42:48.149 --> 01:43:00.093]  It's what your mentality is, how much you know about the big picture, who you choose to interview or not interview, who you choose to promote and not promote.
[01:43:00.573 --> 01:43:01.653]  That's your choice.
[01:43:01.673 --> 01:43:03.834]  So you're trying to point this out to get people to think deeper?
[01:43:03.854 --> 01:43:06.314]  Of course I am.
[01:43:07.495 --> 01:43:08.335]  That's the whole point.
[01:43:08.675 --> 01:43:16.157]  The thing is, we're getting caught again on the left right kind of
[01:43:17.037 --> 01:43:18.618]  No, I agree.
[01:43:18.658 --> 01:43:20.658]  So let me ask you this.
[01:43:20.898 --> 01:43:22.139]  Let me ask some questions.
[01:43:22.179 --> 01:43:24.659]  Let me ask some questions here, David.
[01:43:24.679 --> 01:43:27.160]  I know you can talk for 10 hours.
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:27.500]  We love you.
[01:43:27.540 --> 01:43:28.100]  Everybody loves you.
[01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:30.321]  Let me ask some questions here because you teed this up.
[01:43:30.341 --> 01:43:31.221]  We've got to have some of these.
[01:43:36.543 --> 01:43:37.724]  Tell us, because I respect you.
[01:43:37.764 --> 01:43:40.505]  I think you're one of the big visionaries of our age.
[01:43:40.986 --> 01:43:42.947]  If not, the top two or three.
[01:43:43.607 --> 01:43:46.408]  Where would Musk take us if we fall for this, if you're right?
[01:43:46.809 --> 01:43:49.130]  Where do they want to take us versus what do you think we should do?
[01:43:50.951 --> 01:44:02.377]  Well, where they want to take us, both the hard cell and the soft cell, is to a connection between the human brain, the human body, and artificial intelligence.
[01:44:03.050 --> 01:44:06.492]  See, the hard sell says this is where we must go.
[01:44:06.572 --> 01:44:07.093]  We should go.
[01:44:07.113 --> 01:44:08.313]  Look at all the fantastic things.
[01:44:08.353 --> 01:44:10.515]  We'll be gods, says Ray Kurzweil.
[01:44:11.195 --> 01:44:16.038]  And Elon Musk says, well, I'm worried, but, you know, there's no stopping it.
[01:44:16.118 --> 01:44:25.063]  So, you know, if we're not going to get left behind by artificial intelligence, we've got to have artificial intelligence connections so that we don't get left behind by artificial intelligence.
[01:44:25.083 --> 01:44:27.305]  And at the end of the day, what happens is,
[01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:30.642]  Humans are connected to artificial intelligence.
[01:44:31.162 --> 01:44:35.305]  And that is something that must not happen.
[01:44:35.946 --> 01:44:38.688]  Because the moment it does, it's over.
[01:44:38.708 --> 01:44:39.589]  So let's talk good news.
[01:44:39.649 --> 01:44:39.889]  I agree.
[01:44:39.909 --> 01:44:41.170]  I'm going to shut up for five minutes.
[01:44:41.610 --> 01:44:43.972]  I'm going to shut up for... Hold on, David, David, David, David.
[01:44:43.992 --> 01:44:45.653]  This is a discussion and debate.
[01:44:45.793 --> 01:44:47.034]  ...tells you to think.
[01:44:47.615 --> 01:44:51.558]  And therefore, we must resist that at all times.
[01:44:51.758 --> 01:44:52.979]  And that means...
[01:44:53.857 --> 01:44:54.718]  So you're saying...
[01:45:11.305 --> 01:45:17.908]  Because I love it when you come on the show and I'll just give you the floor and I'll give you 80% of the time, but this is more of a debate discussion here, so just please let me ask these questions.
[01:45:18.388 --> 01:45:25.331]  You're saying this is good cop, bad cop, with Elon Musk as the good cop and Bill Gaines and Klaus Schwab as the bad cops.
[01:45:25.431 --> 01:45:28.552]  If that's right, you're talking about solutions.
[01:45:29.092 --> 01:45:30.593]  What do we do to then counter this?
[01:45:33.214 --> 01:45:35.695]  Well, we absolutely do not buy...
[01:45:37.405 --> 01:45:41.566]  Having a connection to artificial intelligence in any way, shape or form.
[01:45:42.146 --> 01:45:45.147]  That's the bottom line, because it's over once we do.
[01:45:45.907 --> 01:45:49.328]  Artificial intelligence will be doing your thinking for you.
[01:45:49.648 --> 01:45:52.168]  It will be doing your emotional responses for you.
[01:45:52.488 --> 01:45:53.809]  That's the whole idea.
[01:45:54.329 --> 01:46:02.350]  I've been writing for decades about the plan to create a hive mind which can be centrally controlled.
[01:46:02.991 --> 01:46:04.871]  And so how do they do that?
[01:46:05.583 --> 01:46:08.564]  Well, they put chips inside you, actually nanochips.
[01:46:09.044 --> 01:46:12.246]  Like I said earlier, in so many ways, this Neuralink thing is a diversion.
[01:46:13.326 --> 01:46:27.732]  And you get connected to the electromagnetic, technologically generated cloud, which these people are creating with their low-orbit satellites, Elon Musk and SpaceX being at the forefront of it.
[01:46:28.753 --> 01:46:33.535]  And if that happens, and I say that...
[01:46:34.844 --> 01:46:57.712]  That self-replicating technology to connect people to the cloud was in the fake vaccines, those that were, those kind, of course there were many saline I'm sure as well, but those self-replicating systems that have been shown in the blood of people who've had the fake vaccine, that's what's supposed to connect us to the cloud.
[01:46:58.479 --> 01:47:15.407]  And every single SpaceX satellite that goes up there, and all the other companies doing it, but they're the leader, every new 5G tower and 6G, 7G tower to come is building this cloud to which we are supposed to be connected.
[01:47:15.888 --> 01:47:17.949]  This is the bottom line.
[01:47:18.489 --> 01:47:19.930]  This is what has to be stopped.
[01:47:19.950 --> 01:47:22.531]  This is what we have to refuse to cooperate with.
[01:47:23.151 --> 01:47:25.792]  But, you know, if you get...
[01:47:27.563 --> 01:47:28.644]  We're good to go.
[01:47:28.664 --> 01:47:28.904]  I think?
[01:47:44.344 --> 01:47:44.864]  All right, David.
[01:47:46.205 --> 01:47:47.226]  I've got a million questions.
[01:47:48.107 --> 01:47:54.151]  And I'm not... Just in the place of debate, you said... I'm going to stop here.
[01:47:54.171 --> 01:47:55.252]  You said, don't make it personal.
[01:47:55.893 --> 01:47:58.315]  I'm not going to be an asshole and read these things.
[01:47:58.535 --> 01:48:02.898]  All I'm telling you is, is that I am not a minion of the system.
[01:48:03.218 --> 01:48:04.619]  I will use any avenue I can.
[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:07.461]  And I see a big bandwagon waking up with the New World Order.
[01:48:07.862 --> 01:48:08.862]  I can't help but get excited.
[01:48:09.003 --> 01:48:10.123]  I do smell the double cross.
[01:48:10.183 --> 01:48:10.804]  I'm going to say this.
[01:48:11.284 --> 01:48:13.166]  When they first put me on X, and a little bit after...
[01:48:13.806 --> 01:48:18.710]  I watched it when I did certain things and exposed certain things, like China and things.
[01:48:18.750 --> 01:48:22.493]  Suddenly, we weren't reaching 10 million people or 5 million people per post.
[01:48:22.853 --> 01:48:23.694]  We've been dialed back.
[01:48:23.934 --> 01:48:29.139]  And we're seeing that now that the conservatives all come in, and now I even talked to some of the biggest accounts.
[01:48:29.599 --> 01:48:30.500]  They're seeing it, too.
[01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:32.882]  So I think you're going in the right direction here.
[01:48:33.262 --> 01:48:36.525]  Let's talk about who you, from your research, think Elon Musk is.
[01:48:37.628 --> 01:48:39.289]  I know you say they want to connect us to AI.
[01:48:39.749 --> 01:48:40.269]  I agree.
[01:48:40.309 --> 01:48:40.709]  We know that.
[01:48:40.769 --> 01:48:41.269]  That's the plan.
[01:48:41.609 --> 01:48:43.490]  But I'm saying, who do you think he is?
[01:48:43.650 --> 01:48:44.771]  Why was he chosen?
[01:48:44.791 --> 01:48:47.952]  And where do you think this is going?
[01:48:48.952 --> 01:48:49.552]  So many questions.
[01:48:49.572 --> 01:48:52.073]  The election, Russia, the wars.
[01:48:53.274 --> 01:48:55.694]  What new crisis is the global system going to use?
[01:48:56.095 --> 01:48:57.815]  A new virus?
[01:48:58.135 --> 01:48:58.956]  We're ten minutes to break.
[01:48:58.976 --> 01:48:59.716]  Nine minutes to break.
[01:48:59.736 --> 01:49:01.056]  I'm trying to get to the floor.
[01:49:01.076 --> 01:49:02.797]  Give us your prognosis or forecast.
[01:49:03.689 --> 01:49:08.670]  Yeah, and I will, but just let me say this in response to what you've just said.
[01:49:10.251 --> 01:49:23.914]  You can use X to get information out, knowing what it is, without describing Elon Musk as the biggest maverick in the last 500 years, mate.
[01:49:25.555 --> 01:49:29.056]  He ain't the biggest maverick in the last 500 minutes.
[01:49:29.756 --> 01:49:33.858]  And if you ask me about who he is, he's a front man.
[01:49:33.878 --> 01:49:35.458]  He's a salesman.
[01:49:36.038 --> 01:49:48.302]  You know, I had to bloody laugh when he said on the Joe Rogan, one of the Joe Rogan interviews, that he spent 80% of his time designing and engineering.
[01:49:49.275 --> 01:49:49.475]  I think.
[01:49:49.495 --> 01:49:49.655]  I think.
[01:50:11.648 --> 01:50:13.670]  Selling the microchip.
[01:50:13.790 --> 01:50:20.257]  He's saying, oh, look, you know, we've got more and more Starlink connections and satellites.
[01:50:20.357 --> 01:50:21.017]  Isn't it great?
[01:50:21.138 --> 01:50:22.139]  Oh, yeah, Elon.
[01:50:22.939 --> 01:50:29.006]  Without people realizing, actually, the prison is being built all around them.
[01:50:29.824 --> 01:50:30.924]  So he's a front man.
[01:50:31.285 --> 01:50:38.247]  And what we need to do is take everything on its merits without falling for the hype.
[01:50:39.228 --> 01:50:47.431]  And that means that we will question these people, whether they run TwitterX or not.
[01:50:47.531 --> 01:50:48.731]  We question them.
[01:50:48.991 --> 01:50:51.572]  We look at what they do, not what they say.
[01:50:51.592 --> 01:50:56.054]  And therefore, we don't fall for the scam.
[01:51:03.732 --> 01:51:05.032]  Sorry, is Alex coming back or what?
[01:51:08.633 --> 01:51:09.314]  Why, has he gone away?
[01:51:09.334 --> 01:51:13.095]  Someone's saying keep going, sir.
[01:51:13.435 --> 01:51:14.055]  Well, I will then.
[01:51:14.975 --> 01:51:16.456]  Oh, he's listening to me.
[01:51:16.536 --> 01:51:16.816]  Okay.
[01:51:17.196 --> 01:51:24.478]  So where I'm going with this is that if you are flying down a freeway,
[01:51:26.158 --> 01:51:39.806]  And you've got the outcome at the end, which is this stuff becomes so well-known that action is taken to bring it down, then you want to take people off the freeway.
[01:51:40.867 --> 01:51:44.769]  You want to take them down the slip road, and ideally you want to put them in a cul-de-sac.
[01:51:45.990 --> 01:51:55.736]  And this is what I'm talking about when I'm saying that the focus on left-right politics is a cul-de-sac.
[01:51:56.437 --> 01:51:57.277]  Are we really so naive?
[01:52:25.276 --> 01:52:25.916]  We're good to go.
[01:52:41.135 --> 01:52:47.997]  We've got to get out of this idea of just looking at left-right and go to the next level.
[01:52:48.017 --> 01:52:59.080]  Well, let me tell you... That level that's controlling and manipulating and playing like the string section, the left-right paradigm, the left-right perception.
[01:52:59.100 --> 01:53:01.280]  Well, David, let me just throw this in real quick, then, and you continue.
[01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:04.121]  I just learned about this the last four or five days.
[01:53:04.781 --> 01:53:07.782]  A lot of really prominent anti-globalist people...
[01:53:08.740 --> 01:53:13.824]  And I'm told, I'm about to be invited, are being invited to the Global Government Summit.
[01:53:14.344 --> 01:53:18.667]  The one Elon was on last year and said, we don't want global government.
[01:53:19.108 --> 01:53:23.150]  They're now inviting a bunch of anti-globalists to their events.
[01:53:23.190 --> 01:53:23.731]  What's that about?
[01:53:26.277 --> 01:53:30.800]  Well, they're trying to co-opt the alternative media.
[01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:33.582]  This is all part of the soft sell.
[01:53:33.642 --> 01:53:35.403]  Sure, and I think that goes with what you're saying.
[01:53:36.243 --> 01:53:38.545]  And we have to hold the line.
[01:53:39.105 --> 01:53:45.309]  You know, the alternative media is something that questions everything.
[01:53:46.207 --> 01:53:49.348]  And it doesn't eulogize anybody.
[01:53:49.929 --> 01:53:56.251]  And it doesn't treat anyone as a god, whether they're Musk or Putin or Trump or anyone.
[01:53:56.731 --> 01:54:05.174]  It dispassionately looks at events and looks at evidence and concludes from that dispassionately what's going on.
[01:54:05.715 --> 01:54:08.736]  Once you start believing in somebody,
[01:54:09.463 --> 01:54:14.886]  Then your ability to be dispassionate is massively diluted.
[01:54:15.287 --> 01:54:19.029]  The alternative media must not get pulled into that.
[01:54:19.069 --> 01:54:19.849]  No, I totally agree.
[01:54:19.909 --> 01:54:22.711]  Like, you have Iconic, we have Man.Video and Infowars.com.
[01:54:23.031 --> 01:54:27.914]  We should use places like X and Rumble and other places to energize our independent platforms.
[01:54:27.934 --> 01:54:30.836]  But everybody shouldn't just only put their eggs in one basket.
[01:54:30.856 --> 01:54:33.257]  We need to decentralize.
[01:54:34.738 --> 01:54:37.160]  Well, the thing is, if everything goes on to X...
[01:54:38.443 --> 01:54:49.011]  And everything is focused on X, and it's pulled in terms of freedom of speech, it already is for some people, then it's over.
[01:54:49.392 --> 01:54:55.236]  And this is the other thing, you know, about Twitter X and Elon Musk.
[01:54:55.917 --> 01:55:03.623]  He changed the name to X and fused it into something, so Twitter disappeared, into something called X Corp.
[01:55:04.420 --> 01:55:13.086]  But the parent company of X Corp that actually owns Twitter X is called X Holdings Corporation.
[01:55:13.866 --> 01:55:33.480]  And some Twitter X employees who are running a court case trying to get some compensation for being fired, they demanded last summer that the shareholders of X Holdings Corporation, the parent company of Twitter, the ultimate owners,
[01:55:34.335 --> 01:55:34.975]  Be revealed.
[01:55:36.095 --> 01:55:47.377]  And they revealed the list, except that every single name, including Elon Musk's, I think we've got an idea, he's one of them, was redacted.
[01:55:47.397 --> 01:56:00.260]  And then they asked, asked the judge to have a situation which she agreed to, whereby the lawyers agreed
[01:56:02.210 --> 01:56:07.294]  Would be told what the list was of the employees.
[01:56:08.195 --> 01:56:14.300]  X. But it's not made public and that they cannot take it any further.
[01:56:14.741 --> 01:56:20.866]  And what did come out of this list of redactions is that there's 95 of them.
[01:56:21.827 --> 01:56:22.447]  Who are they?
[01:56:23.328 --> 01:56:24.129]  Why don't we know?
[01:56:24.329 --> 01:56:25.490]  Come on, Elon, let's have you.
[01:56:26.291 --> 01:56:28.833]  Let's see who the 95 shareholders are.
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:33.526]  of ex-Holdings Corporation, so we know who actually owns this deal.
[01:56:34.352 --> 01:56:35.672]  You know, we're talking about transparency, right?
[01:56:35.692 --> 01:56:36.772]  All right, and we've got to go to break.
[01:56:37.153 --> 01:56:42.774]  And we did, speaking of X, we have an X Spaces going, and sometimes Elon pops into these.
[01:56:43.294 --> 01:56:44.494]  We've sent invites to him.
[01:56:44.654 --> 01:56:48.955]  I don't know if he is, but this is not our regular lecture.
[01:56:48.995 --> 01:56:50.015]  We love you.
[01:56:50.275 --> 01:56:51.695]  Once you're on, come on, three hours.
[01:56:51.735 --> 01:56:52.876]  You can just lecture us.
[01:56:53.376 --> 01:56:54.536]  I'll have you talk 80% of the time.
[01:56:54.556 --> 01:56:55.456]  You've got a new book coming out.
[01:56:55.816 --> 01:56:56.636]  Hope you come back on next week.
[01:56:56.696 --> 01:56:57.377]  I'm not lecturing.
[01:56:57.417 --> 01:56:58.857]  I'm just stating my opinion.
[01:56:58.897 --> 01:56:59.117]  No, no, no.
[01:56:59.717 --> 01:57:02.639]  I hope you come on next week and just particularly talk about the book.
[01:57:03.500 --> 01:57:10.985]  But we're going to bring in some folks with questions and comments randomly off of X when we come back.
[01:57:11.025 --> 01:57:12.486]  But you'll have some more time to finish up.
[01:57:12.807 --> 01:57:14.048]  You can stay the whole next hour if you want.
[01:57:14.068 --> 01:57:15.088]  You can leave in 30 minutes if you want.
[01:57:15.108 --> 01:57:19.652]  But we've got to start the third hour right now with David Icke.
[01:57:20.712 --> 01:57:25.416]  People can find all of his work at DavidIcke.com and you can also find it
[01:57:26.661 --> 01:57:27.822]  At iconic.com.
[01:57:28.223 --> 01:57:30.966]  And we have the David Icke channel on band.video.
[01:57:31.326 --> 01:57:36.932]  Which we've seen band.video get a lot less traffic since we're on X. That's not good because we have all those other great contributors on there.
[01:57:38.253 --> 01:57:39.054]  So I get what David's saying.
[01:57:39.675 --> 01:57:41.637]  We'll be right back with our number three.
[01:57:41.657 --> 01:57:43.999]  And we're live on Spaces on X. Stay with us.
[01:57:50.290 --> 01:57:50.390]  So,
[01:58:13.490 --> 01:58:21.757]  Well, I'm glad you mentioned that because it's methylfolate, the breakdown of folic acid, and a lot of people, particularly Europeans, don't absorb all of the folic acid.
[01:58:21.997 --> 01:58:23.098]  So it's not a stimulant.
[01:58:23.298 --> 01:58:26.721]  It's a totally natural thing that boosts energy that's foundational.
[01:58:27.021 --> 01:58:29.583]  And was I lying to you or did it not work?
[01:58:30.263 --> 01:58:31.484]  No, it was top-notch.
[01:58:31.504 --> 01:58:35.147]  And I was actually taking Red Pill Plus before, and that's got a little folic acid in it.
[01:58:35.187 --> 01:58:38.990]  I think there was a little buildup from this, but the energy from this was no jitters.
[01:58:39.170 --> 01:58:40.091]  I mean, it's top-notch.
[01:58:40.171 --> 01:58:40.892]  It's a great product.
[01:58:41.311 --> 01:58:42.253]  Well, thank you so much.
[01:58:42.313 --> 01:58:46.061]  Yeah, no, folic acid's great and it's in real red pill, but some can't break it down.
[01:58:46.102 --> 01:58:47.104]  This is the breakdown of it.
[01:58:47.184 --> 01:58:47.865]  That's exactly it.
[01:58:48.866 --> 01:58:59.395]  Naturally sourced from the finest hemp plants in America, RebelZen offers the absolute finest quality CBD available and at the lowest prices.
[01:59:00.435 --> 01:59:15.027]  Extracted using a cold pressed technique to retain the molecular integrity of the cannabinoids and terpenes within the plant, this full spectrum formula ensures that your nervous system gets the full benefits of CBD.
[01:59:16.228 --> 01:59:26.152]  Premium quality organic CBD, like Rebel Zen, has been shown to naturally reduce anxiety, relieve pain, and decrease inflammation.
[01:59:26.652 --> 01:59:34.274]  People have reported a reduction in symptoms of insomnia, arthritis, seizures, chronic pain, and epilepsy.
[01:59:34.735 --> 01:59:41.357]  Several studies have shown it helps to reduce cortisol, increase serotonin, and boost vitality.

[02:00:18.473 --> 02:00:19.886]  I don't know.
[02:00:27.312 --> 02:00:29.672]  All right, well, David's raised some really important thoughts.
[02:00:29.712 --> 02:00:34.734]  We should always investigate everything, look at every angle, and I tend to lean with the direction he's going.
[02:00:34.774 --> 02:00:36.134]  But I also want to look at gift horse in the mouth.
[02:00:36.154 --> 02:00:41.355]  I'm going to use X. I'm going to ride the horse until it dies, or until we win, or until I'm kicked off of it.
[02:00:41.395 --> 02:00:44.235]  But, David, we've got a short segment here because some stations join us.
[02:00:44.656 --> 02:00:48.216]  You've agreed to do some X questions from people on X Spaces coming up.
[02:00:48.896 --> 02:00:50.157]  David, we've got four minutes to break.
[02:00:50.537 --> 02:00:51.717]  What else is on your radar screen?
[02:00:54.093 --> 02:00:55.134]  Well, I'm writing a book at the moment.
[02:00:55.755 --> 02:01:07.970]  It's a deep, deep, deep, deep, deep in the rabbit hole book, which is, you know, what ultimately controls the cult that controls humanity.
[02:01:08.230 --> 02:01:08.711]  And of course,
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:11.020]  We've talked about this before.
[02:01:11.621 --> 02:01:18.263]  That force is not actually human and doesn't actually operate in this reality we call human.
[02:01:18.323 --> 02:01:21.244]  So that's what I'm writing at the moment.
[02:01:22.184 --> 02:01:38.469]  It's very, very deep stuff and amazing stuff because what's starting to happen is that some of the things that, a lot of the things that I've been writing about over the decades in relation to all this and got so much abuse and
[02:01:39.541 --> 02:01:40.402]  Ridicule for.
[02:01:41.322 --> 02:01:47.845]  A lot of people in science now who are coming from that direction are starting to say it makes sense.
[02:01:48.426 --> 02:01:58.070]  And they're kind of explaining it from their point of view of how it can work, like that this is a virtual reality simulation that we're experiencing.
[02:01:58.571 --> 02:02:03.153]  Just across the water, I live on an island just off the south coast of England.
[02:02:04.352 --> 02:02:16.899]  And just before Christmas there was a guy, a physicist from Portsmouth University, in all the papers in Britain, talking about the fact that he believed that we do live in a simulation.
[02:02:17.820 --> 02:02:24.943]  There's lots of scientists now who are starting to see that it makes sense of what otherwise is an unexplainable world.
[02:02:25.504 --> 02:02:29.866]  And I've been writing and saying that since not long after the turn of the millennium.
[02:02:30.507 --> 02:02:32.908]  So there's a lot of things coming together
[02:02:34.505 --> 02:02:50.983]  Of the real, real big picture variety that needs to be understood by people so we can see where this is really coming from and not just focus only on the symptoms, but see where the cause is.
[02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:05.952]  So I'm a bit kind of bewildered because I'm answering a question and then someone's saying to me, keep going, David.
[02:03:06.072 --> 02:03:07.354]  I mean, is Alex disappearing?
[02:03:07.374 --> 02:03:07.815]  What's going on?
[02:03:09.082 --> 02:03:14.723]  No, David, I actually jumped up because they have to have my phone to connect to X because we're about to... All right, okay.
[02:03:14.763 --> 02:03:17.964]  I was literally just handing him my phone, and we're about to take the calls.
[02:03:18.264 --> 02:03:22.505]  I got an earpiece in, so I just walked over there to hand him a phone, and he stopped right when I got up.
[02:03:22.925 --> 02:03:24.025]  See, I'm listening to you.
[02:03:24.065 --> 02:03:25.746]  See the little receiver here?
[02:03:26.426 --> 02:03:28.546]  So I'm not ignoring... I'm listening to everything you're saying.
[02:03:28.566 --> 02:03:30.727]  I'm accusing of interrupting here, but I'm trying to get you to talk.
[02:03:31.661 --> 02:03:32.241]  No, no, no.
[02:03:32.361 --> 02:03:33.341]  That's all right.
[02:03:34.261 --> 02:03:36.702]  When it goes quiet and someone says, keep going, I thought, what's going on?
[02:03:37.182 --> 02:03:41.003]  Anyway, yeah, so that's the sort of stuff I'm working on.
[02:03:41.023 --> 02:03:42.743]  And I've been working on for quite a long time.
[02:03:43.743 --> 02:03:44.983]  Well, a very long time now.
[02:03:45.503 --> 02:03:56.985]  And that's the fact that, you know, we can look at the manipulation at the level of politics and finance and the human world, if you like.
[02:03:57.765 --> 02:04:00.946]  But the biggest manipulation of all
[02:04:02.233 --> 02:04:04.874]  Is the manipulation of our sense of reality.
[02:04:05.814 --> 02:04:14.876]  You know, we live our lives as if we're living in a solid world where everything's kind of apart from everything else.
[02:04:15.597 --> 02:04:20.318]  But that's only one level of this and it's illusory.
[02:04:21.590 --> 02:04:31.797]  The way that we are constructing our reality is exactly the same as the principle of Wi-Fi and a computer.
[02:04:32.258 --> 02:04:32.778]  Absolutely.
[02:04:32.798 --> 02:04:36.440]  It's almost like we're being grown like lab rats to be interfaced.
[02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:37.961]  Back in 60 seconds, finish.
[02:04:39.622 --> 02:04:49.809]  I did find it kind of interesting that one or two people now are starting to say, actually, maybe there's a non-human force that's manipulating.
[02:04:51.070 --> 02:04:52.631]  Let's talk about that non-human force.
[02:04:52.651 --> 02:04:53.512]  Stay there 60 seconds.
[02:04:53.552 --> 02:04:54.993]  We're on all these radio stations.
[02:04:55.013 --> 02:04:55.773]  That's why we're still on air.
[02:04:56.193 --> 02:04:56.694]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:58.635 --> 02:05:00.476]  But folks, we're standing up for our rights.
[02:05:00.496 --> 02:05:01.577]  We're standing up for your rights.
[02:05:01.617 --> 02:05:03.998]  We're standing up for all of our freedoms and our children.
[02:05:04.218 --> 02:05:11.863]  If you don't spread the word about the broadcast, if you don't share the links, if you don't buy products at Infowarsstore.com, then I'm not griping at you.
[02:05:11.883 --> 02:05:12.984]  I'm just saying, what are you doing?
[02:05:14.065 --> 02:05:17.367]  Less than 1% of you ever buy a product at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:05:18.266 --> 02:05:25.228]  If just half a percent more would go buy a book or a film or a t-shirt or get some of our great supplements and then reorder them because they really work.
[02:05:25.568 --> 02:05:26.149]  Just try it.
[02:05:26.769 --> 02:05:28.710]  We would be able to do so many things.
[02:05:29.070 --> 02:05:32.851]  I'm praying to God that he'll touch your heart to decide to support us.
[02:05:33.371 --> 02:05:35.172]  Infowarsstore.com
[02:05:37.278 --> 02:05:37.938]  It's been sold out.
[02:05:37.978 --> 02:05:38.758]  It's back in stock.
[02:05:38.818 --> 02:05:40.019]  Reformulated even stronger.
[02:05:40.799 --> 02:05:42.680]  Nitric boost to clean out your blood and your whole body.
[02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:44.220]  Vasodilation.
[02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:46.601]  It's got a lot of wonderful side effects.
[02:05:46.621 --> 02:05:47.301]  And I mean good ones.
[02:05:47.321 --> 02:05:48.482]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:05:49.102 --> 02:05:50.002]  It is powerful.
[02:05:50.042 --> 02:05:50.962]  So be careful with it.
[02:05:51.322 --> 02:05:52.463]  Next level foundational energy.
[02:05:52.583 --> 02:05:55.224]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:05:55.344 --> 02:05:56.304]  I've got a tiger in my...
[02:06:10.493 --> 02:06:12.595]  He never gives up.
[02:06:12.735 --> 02:06:20.440]  He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[02:06:21.441 --> 02:06:30.988]  It was back in the mid-1990s that David said non-human, interdimensional creatures are sucking our souls and killing us and making us war with each other.
[02:06:32.088 --> 02:06:33.930]  Now when you talk about it, it's mainline news.
[02:06:33.970 --> 02:06:35.511]  Now Tucker Carlson says he believes it.
[02:06:35.851 --> 02:06:36.612]  People don't balk.
[02:06:36.652 --> 02:06:37.913]  So there's a big awakening.
[02:06:37.933 --> 02:06:41.816]  I want to go to some of these X-Spaces comments or questions.
[02:06:41.896 --> 02:06:43.157]  Quick ones for David Icke here.
[02:06:43.717 --> 02:06:45.739]  Amazing discussion last hour about Elon Musk.
[02:06:45.759 --> 02:06:47.020]  A lot of thought-provoking things.
[02:06:47.320 --> 02:06:50.343]  We appreciate David being here, especially with all he's been going through lately.
[02:06:50.403 --> 02:06:51.403]  His new book's coming out.
[02:06:51.664 --> 02:06:52.805]  He promises to come back soon.
[02:06:52.825 --> 02:06:55.467]  We'll do a commercial-free podcast and talk about the new book.
[02:06:55.487 --> 02:06:57.288]  We'll plug it before he leaves as well.
[02:06:57.308 --> 02:06:59.090]  But you got interrupted by that little...
[02:06:59.910 --> 02:07:00.931]  I think we're good to go.
[02:07:00.951 --> 02:07:02.312]  I think we're good to go.
[02:07:31.154 --> 02:07:48.858]  One thing that should be taught to every child as soon as they're old enough to grasp it is that when you look through your eyes in the space you think you're looking at, you're not seeing everything in the space that you appear to be seeing.
[02:07:48.998 --> 02:07:57.300]  You're seeing a tiny band of frequency called visible light that is so tiny it's a bloody joke.
[02:07:58.677 --> 02:08:19.074]  If you take the projected size of the universe as perceived at the moment by mainstream science, then the electromagnetic spectrum, which is basically our reality, is around 0.005% of what exists in the universe in terms of energy and all its forms.
[02:08:20.074 --> 02:08:24.398]  And visible light, which is the only frequency band that we can actually see,
[02:08:25.959 --> 02:08:29.943]  Is a smear of the 0.005%.
[02:08:30.043 --> 02:08:31.464]  Humans are basically blind.
[02:08:32.125 --> 02:08:35.608]  And as I've explained in the books in great detail, there's a reason for that.
[02:08:35.708 --> 02:08:40.752]  We're designed to be basically blind because then we'll not see what the hell is going on and what we're part of.
[02:08:41.733 --> 02:08:52.383]  And so if you look at technology as it's coming in now, the AI and the computerization, all of this stuff,
[02:08:53.268 --> 02:09:01.471]  What it's doing, and not by accident either, is mimicking the very reality that we're experiencing.
[02:09:01.611 --> 02:09:06.973]  The virtual reality that we're experiencing is being mimicked by this technology.
[02:09:07.613 --> 02:09:20.498]  What they're doing, and this is what this cloud's all about, is they're laying another layer of illusion on top of the big illusion, which is the simulation in general.
[02:09:23.482 --> 02:09:34.510]  And because we can see a fraction of what there is to see in the space that we're in, all infinity exists in the space that you're sitting in now.
[02:09:35.390 --> 02:09:46.038]  But we can't see it because it's on a different wavelength, a different frequency to the one that we are tuned to and what this body computer, biological computer, that's what it is, locks us into.
[02:09:47.219 --> 02:09:47.479]  And so
[02:09:48.451 --> 02:09:54.555]  If you look at the way that a computer decodes Wi-Fi, it's exactly the way that we're decoding this simulation.
[02:09:55.196 --> 02:09:57.898]  This simulation is not a construct.
[02:09:57.918 --> 02:09:59.378]  It's not a physical construct.
[02:09:59.999 --> 02:10:03.121]  It's a field of information, just like Wi-Fi.
[02:10:03.982 --> 02:10:10.746]  And so what happens is a computer, although I'm looking around, if there's Wi-Fi in this room, where is it?
[02:10:10.786 --> 02:10:11.527]  We can't see it.
[02:10:11.567 --> 02:10:15.749]  No, because it's outside of the wavelength of human sight.
[02:10:17.665 --> 02:10:28.369]  But if you get a computer and you tune it to the internet, what comes on the screen is whatever part of the internet, the Wi-Fi field that you've chosen to go to and see.
[02:10:29.169 --> 02:10:41.094]  And what you're seeing, if you said to people, tell me about the internet, they'd say, well, it's pictures on the screen, it's moving pictures, it's graphics, it's text and all that stuff.
[02:10:41.114 --> 02:10:41.674]  Yes, it is.
[02:10:43.155 --> 02:10:46.316]  But the internet in that form only exists on the screen.
[02:10:47.427 --> 02:10:51.789]  Everywhere else, it's a Wi-Fi field of information and electrical circuits.
[02:10:53.149 --> 02:11:01.232]  And so then you think, well, where is what I'm looking at, that Internet that I perceive as the Internet?
[02:11:01.332 --> 02:11:01.952]  Where is it?
[02:11:02.533 --> 02:11:03.853]  It's inside the computer.
[02:11:04.513 --> 02:11:06.134]  It's not here or there or there.
[02:11:06.194 --> 02:11:07.535]  It's inside the computer.
[02:11:07.915 --> 02:11:13.817]  So then you take to the, this is not, you know, pulling it out of the ether.
[02:11:13.857 --> 02:11:15.077]  This is mainstream science.
[02:11:15.257 --> 02:11:16.558]  How do we create reality?
[02:11:17.722 --> 02:11:26.467]  What happens is the five senses are locking us in to this cosmic Wi-Fi field, shall we say, this simulation Wi-Fi field.
[02:11:27.968 --> 02:11:33.391]  And the five senses, the ears are a wonderful example, but they all work the same.
[02:11:34.412 --> 02:11:39.555]  They're picking up wave field information, wave information, just like sound waves with the ears.
[02:11:40.335 --> 02:11:44.558]  They then turn it into electrical information, which they communicate to the brain
[02:11:45.322 --> 02:11:52.744]  And there's certain areas of the brain that specialize in decoding that electrical information from the various senses.
[02:11:53.084 --> 02:12:04.046]  And the brain then forms it into the reality that we think is outside of us, but it's actually in here, just as the reality of the Wi-Fi is in the computer.
[02:12:05.526 --> 02:12:12.828]  And so if you break this down to the big picture consequences...
[02:12:14.384 --> 02:12:31.852]  The very foundation of human control and the manipulation of human perception is at the very level that we perceive reality itself.
[02:12:33.613 --> 02:12:39.056]  We are living a reality that appears to be a certain kind of reality, but it isn't.
[02:12:39.996 --> 02:12:43.298]  And if you're manipulating people's
[02:12:43.968 --> 02:13:07.792]  The very sense of reality, the very sense of the world they're existing in, which is nothing like what it seems to be as we experience it, then you go down the levels to the manipulation of politics, and these are just symptoms of the big, big manipulation, which is the manipulation of our reality itself.
[02:13:08.172 --> 02:13:12.633]  Let me just say this to finish the point.
[02:13:13.957 --> 02:13:23.444]  Like I say, we now have technology unfolding that is mimicking the very simulated reality that we're experiencing.
[02:13:24.965 --> 02:13:26.526]  And so we have headsets.
[02:13:27.847 --> 02:13:31.610]  So you... Look at the internet now.
[02:13:31.690 --> 02:13:35.733]  There's more and more pictures of these people with headsets on walking down the street.
[02:13:36.093 --> 02:13:37.694]  Even driving bloody cars.
[02:13:38.655 --> 02:13:39.655]  Autonomous cars.
[02:13:40.716 --> 02:13:40.876]  And so...
[02:13:43.473 --> 02:13:58.363]  You go on the internet and you look at compilations of people with headsets on who are, the moment they put them on, their sense of reality is completely taken over.
[02:13:59.204 --> 02:14:02.045]  They're jumping around, they're screaming, they're falling over.
[02:14:02.065 --> 02:14:05.508]  Yeah, that shows they were already pre-programmed and have been prepped for this.
[02:14:06.468 --> 02:14:08.810]  Yeah, the point being, yeah.
[02:14:08.930 --> 02:14:09.830]  I get nauseous.
[02:14:09.930 --> 02:14:10.591]  I can't wear them.
[02:14:11.710 --> 02:14:13.350]  Well, I don't even go there.
[02:14:13.371 --> 02:14:14.971]  But they put their headsets on.
[02:14:15.691 --> 02:14:17.212]  And they might be in an empty room.
[02:14:17.252 --> 02:14:18.952]  There might be one or two people there, whatever.
[02:14:19.512 --> 02:14:26.214]  And suddenly, the information coming through their headset has completely taken over their sense of reality.
[02:14:26.514 --> 02:14:27.334]  They're possessed!
[02:14:27.394 --> 02:14:28.595]  They're possessed!
[02:14:29.775 --> 02:14:35.296]  What they can do is take the headset off and go, phew, it was just a game.
[02:14:36.037 --> 02:14:40.938]  Now imagine if the headset was the biological computer
[02:14:41.812 --> 02:14:42.573]  They're totally free.
[02:15:00.899 --> 02:15:06.283]  They are experiencing a completely different reality with different levels of physics.
[02:15:06.803 --> 02:15:07.164]  Why?
[02:15:07.644 --> 02:15:08.705]  What are physics?
[02:15:08.905 --> 02:15:10.426]  What are the laws of physics?
[02:15:10.886 --> 02:15:15.950]  They are the codes encoded into the simulation.
[02:15:15.990 --> 02:15:17.971]  David, you've told us this a hundred times.
[02:15:18.231 --> 02:15:18.852]  I agree with you.
[02:15:19.252 --> 02:15:19.873]  People are waking up.
[02:15:19.893 --> 02:15:20.993]  You're a trailblazer.
[02:15:21.013 --> 02:15:23.435]  A bunch of your books, I've read most of them, get into this.
[02:15:23.455 --> 02:15:25.076]  What's the best book to understand all this?
[02:15:26.918 --> 02:15:28.739]  Well, the latest one's called...
[02:15:30.024 --> 02:15:31.385]  It's an induced dream.
[02:15:31.686 --> 02:15:40.053]  And if you want a real deep, deep, massive one like that, is one called Everything You Need to Know But Have Never Been Told.
[02:15:40.994 --> 02:15:44.457]  So we are experiencing a reality.
[02:15:44.577 --> 02:15:48.420]  Imagine you come out of the womb with a headset on.
[02:15:49.702 --> 02:15:51.163]  Your parents have got headsets on.
[02:15:52.017 --> 02:15:54.818]  You go to school, your mates have got headsets on, the teachers have got headsets on.
[02:15:54.838 --> 02:15:57.619]  And you're saying that's what we're already in, and now we're breaking out of that.
[02:15:58.579 --> 02:15:59.820]  That's what we're already in.
[02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:09.343]  And if you have a headset on from leaving the womb to entering the tomb, then when you see how reality... That's how they trick your soul.
[02:16:09.384 --> 02:16:11.404]  That's how they manipulate you towards some greater end.
[02:16:11.764 --> 02:16:16.286]  You've got to come back... You're going to believe that reality, and that's what we are.
[02:16:16.386 --> 02:16:21.168]  We're believing a reality that actually is a simulation for one reason...
[02:16:22.006 --> 02:16:23.928]  To control our sense of perception.
[02:16:24.369 --> 02:16:26.371]  And from perception comes behavior.
[02:16:26.751 --> 02:16:29.594]  And if you control behavior, you control society.
[02:16:29.634 --> 02:16:29.834]  Sure.
[02:16:29.934 --> 02:16:30.795]  I'm going to nail you down.
[02:16:30.815 --> 02:16:33.418]  I'm going to nail you down because I want to go to some of these calls before you've got to go.
[02:16:33.438 --> 02:16:35.380]  Some of these ex-comments.
[02:16:35.741 --> 02:16:37.763]  I have no idea what they're going to say, who they are.
[02:16:37.783 --> 02:16:39.344]  I think the crew may know someone.
[02:16:39.364 --> 02:16:39.945]  They're looking them up.
[02:16:40.345 --> 02:16:44.410]  But just in closing, when are you going to come on commercial-free hour on your new book?
[02:16:46.061 --> 02:16:47.261]  Well, I'm still writing it.
[02:16:47.562 --> 02:16:48.282]  That's the point.
[02:16:48.322 --> 02:16:57.605]  That's why I said to Daria, you know, I couldn't come on in January because I was in a really deep series.
[02:16:57.665 --> 02:16:58.225]  I understand.
[02:16:58.285 --> 02:17:01.226]  So as soon as you're ready, DavidWag.com, we want to do it.
[02:17:01.346 --> 02:17:04.307]  Back in the spring, maybe, would be the best time to do that.
[02:17:04.387 --> 02:17:04.948]  All right.
[02:17:04.968 --> 02:17:05.648]  We'll get you on soon.
[02:17:05.848 --> 02:17:07.969]  While we've still got you, let's pull up X's.
[02:17:07.989 --> 02:17:09.149]  We've only done this three or four times.
[02:17:09.629 --> 02:17:11.650]  And instead of phone calls, this is people on X.
[02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:22.854]  Let's go to Brian Krasenstein.
[02:17:22.894 --> 02:17:23.814]  He joined and asked to speak.
[02:17:23.834 --> 02:17:25.575]  Go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you got to say, Brian.
[02:17:27.035 --> 02:17:31.837]  Hey, yeah, no, I just jumped in here, so I caught the tail end of everything that you're saying, but I actually...
[02:17:34.309 --> 02:17:34.889]  I think it sounds.
[02:17:34.909 --> 02:17:41.814]  I believe we're living in a simulation, or at least I think that that's more likely than a lot of the other alternatives.
[02:17:42.375 --> 02:17:51.862]  And the saying goes, if you think we're going to be able to actually simulate a universe in the future, then the probability is we're actually living in a simulation.
[02:17:52.382 --> 02:18:00.628]  If you combine Neuralink with Apple's headset right now and then consider AI being able to render environments that
[02:18:01.229 --> 02:18:07.212]  Well, I think it's absolutely yes, and what I would say, mate, is that we're already there, because this simulation is doing just that.
[02:18:07.232 --> 02:18:09.913]  And it's another interesting thing, you know, if you're creating a simulation...
[02:18:29.791 --> 02:18:50.825]  And you want to absolutely control people's perception, therefore their behavior, then you don't want them interacting with other species of life within that, quote, universe, so that there's an exchange of knowledge, an exchange of understanding.
[02:18:51.005 --> 02:18:55.628]  You want them to believe they're isolated and you want them to live a life as if it's isolated.
[02:18:56.188 --> 02:18:57.109]  So you look out
[02:18:57.950 --> 02:18:59.010]  We're good to go.
[02:19:23.979 --> 02:19:24.380]  We're good to go.
[02:19:34.955 --> 02:19:37.195]  That we're all alone despite all that.
[02:19:37.776 --> 02:19:39.996]  Of course it's alone, because it's a projection.
[02:19:40.196 --> 02:19:42.317]  It's a simulation.
[02:19:42.857 --> 02:19:50.898]  And the emptiness and the lack of life that it seems to have is encoded into the simulation.
[02:19:50.918 --> 02:19:58.480]  And David, you've been saying that for 30 years, and now all these mainline scientists, as you mentioned, are saying they think it's a simulation as well.
[02:19:59.860 --> 02:20:03.281]  I want to go back to the journalist that called in for a response back to David.
[02:20:05.673 --> 02:20:20.384]  Yeah, and part of Fermi's Paradox, one of the suggestions is that the reason why aliens haven't reached out is because when a civilization gets technologically advanced enough, instead of going outward into space, they go inward.
[02:20:21.465 --> 02:20:32.072]  What's interesting, I think what's kind of getting a lot of scientists to come down this road is because if it's a simulation, a lot of
[02:20:50.425 --> 02:20:55.930]  Mysteries of life and reality start to make sense.
[02:20:56.050 --> 02:21:08.520]  For instance, what I said just after the turn of the millennium is that this is a simulation and the limit of the simulation at this level is, because there are others, is the speed of light.
[02:21:09.460 --> 02:21:17.667]  There was an article in Scientific American in April 2021 where this academic had written this article saying he believed we lived in a simulation.
[02:21:18.476 --> 02:21:22.300]  And he was saying that he felt the limit of the simulation was the speed of light.
[02:21:22.501 --> 02:21:23.762]  Fell off me chair.
[02:21:24.082 --> 02:21:25.504]  And he was...
[02:21:27.850 --> 02:21:31.733]  Presenting the speed of light as the processing speed of the simulation.
[02:21:56.932 --> 02:21:58.372]  Let's go with Adrian Dittman.
[02:21:58.432 --> 02:22:00.693]  Adrian, go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you have to say.
[02:22:03.314 --> 02:22:10.936]  Yeah, I think it's really interesting that David Icke, say, complains of, I don't know, being connected to the hive mind, even though he already is.
[02:22:10.956 --> 02:22:16.938]  I mean, you're right now speaking to thousands of people simultaneously, which is a selective hive mind, be a piece of tech.
[02:22:17.398 --> 02:22:18.799]  It's just not integrated into your brain.
[02:22:18.819 --> 02:22:19.759]  That's the only difference.
[02:22:20.599 --> 02:22:30.361]  As for Wi-Fi fields, do you think that the Internet is what a simulated reality pulled over our eyes, or just an interface?
[02:22:30.381 --> 02:22:33.402]  No, he's saying we're already in a false reality.
[02:22:33.722 --> 02:22:34.262]  Sorry, I'll shut up.
[02:22:34.522 --> 02:22:39.003]  He's saying we're already in a false reality, and they're creating a system within a system.
[02:22:39.043 --> 02:22:39.483]  Right, David?
[02:22:40.763 --> 02:22:42.924]  That's absolutely right.
[02:22:43.184 --> 02:22:49.985]  But there's a big difference from what the gentleman has just said, that we're in a hide mind and all that stuff as we're speaking.
[02:22:50.603 --> 02:23:02.877]  But, you know, there's a difference between having connections with people and communications with people and having the perceptions that we make
[02:23:03.977 --> 02:23:08.361]  Of what we say and what we make of what other people say.
[02:23:08.421 --> 02:23:11.623]  It's going to show us the input it wants, is the issue.
[02:23:11.663 --> 02:23:16.206]  Yeah, being given to us by a hive mind.
[02:23:16.747 --> 02:23:23.432]  You know, it was kind of funny how sci-fi kind of later mirrors reality.
[02:23:23.452 --> 02:23:25.253]  It's probably not a coincidence either.
[02:23:25.974 --> 02:23:31.018]  And in Star Trek, they had the Borg thing.
[02:23:32.409 --> 02:23:39.030]  And the Borg were kind of a part technological kind of race.
[02:23:39.950 --> 02:23:53.893]  And what they did was infuse people with like nanoprobes to make them part of the Borg hive mind, the collective as they called it.
[02:23:54.793 --> 02:24:01.594]  And those nanoprobes we now call smart dust, nanobots, nanotechnology, all these things.
[02:24:02.282 --> 02:24:06.428]  And this is all building this hive mind that I'm talking about.
[02:24:07.210 --> 02:24:09.813]  And like I say, it's fine.
[02:24:09.914 --> 02:24:11.356]  And interaction is fine.
[02:24:11.396 --> 02:24:12.037]  We should have it.
[02:24:12.057 --> 02:24:12.738]  Of course we should.
[02:24:12.798 --> 02:24:16.243]  That's why I'm glad the Putin interview happened.
[02:24:16.983 --> 02:24:24.425]  But there's a big difference between that and having our perceptions controlled in... Let me say this.
[02:24:24.565 --> 02:24:29.106]  Notice how the globalists want to kill individual free communication in the Internet.
[02:24:29.386 --> 02:24:34.668]  They want it to all be through this filter, which is another form of the virtual reality paradigm you're talking about.
[02:24:34.708 --> 02:24:39.009]  I forget the name of the person commenting, but, sir, do you want to have a comeback to David Icke?
[02:24:39.029 --> 02:24:39.329]  Go ahead.
[02:24:42.210 --> 02:24:42.670]  Is he gone?
[02:24:44.477 --> 02:24:44.779]  Okay.
[02:24:44.919 --> 02:24:45.522]  I'm still here.
[02:24:46.064 --> 02:24:46.907]  Come back to that?
[02:24:46.947 --> 02:24:47.188]  Go ahead.
[02:24:50.825 --> 02:24:52.445]  Yeah, you're already connected to all of this.
[02:24:52.506 --> 02:24:56.026]  You think that everything is different or that we don't have a smart dust hose.
[02:24:56.047 --> 02:25:02.208]  We don't need smart dust when you have a device that is capable of all the things that you've mentioned and you are already connected to the hive mind.
[02:25:02.328 --> 02:25:04.069]  What the hell are you communicating on right now?
[02:25:04.149 --> 02:25:05.309]  Who are you communicating with?
[02:25:05.829 --> 02:25:06.529]  All the people.
[02:25:06.589 --> 02:25:08.850]  Their perceptions share through a medium of speech.
[02:25:09.290 --> 02:25:18.753]  Like, there is structurally no difference between having a bunch of nanobots running through your bloodstream accomplishing the same thing when you're holding a device that is connected to this thing that is a field of information that is the internet.
[02:25:19.335 --> 02:25:22.734]  There's nothing wrong about it, there's nothing strange about it, it's just the way
[02:25:27.735 --> 02:25:31.896]  By the way, I think this is Elon Musk.
[02:25:31.956 --> 02:25:33.676]  Is this Elon Musk?
[02:25:33.956 --> 02:25:34.616]  It's really not.
[02:25:34.956 --> 02:25:35.677]  No, no, it's really not.
[02:25:35.717 --> 02:25:36.157]  I'm just weird.
[02:25:36.177 --> 02:25:37.037]  Don't worry about it.
[02:25:37.377 --> 02:25:39.077]  Well, you could be a dead ringer for him.
[02:25:39.337 --> 02:25:41.858]  Well, the Elon clone, what else do you want to say?
[02:25:42.918 --> 02:25:44.098]  Elon clone, go ahead.
[02:25:44.138 --> 02:25:44.978]  There are theories.
[02:25:45.038 --> 02:25:45.639]  There are theories.
[02:25:46.059 --> 02:25:46.879]  There are theories.
[02:25:47.199 --> 02:25:49.119]  I don't know.
[02:25:49.199 --> 02:25:49.599]  Okay.
[02:25:49.679 --> 02:25:50.419]  It's kind of stupid.
[02:25:50.439 --> 02:25:51.180]  Don't worry about it.
[02:25:51.480 --> 02:25:52.880]  Well, what else would you like to say, sir?
[02:25:56.090 --> 02:25:58.791]  I just think it is ironic.
[02:25:58.851 --> 02:26:00.372]  I mean, you want to talk about the simulation.
[02:26:00.412 --> 02:26:05.634]  Everybody started speaking of the topic of simulation, how we're in this false reality ever since the Matrix movie dropped.
[02:26:06.215 --> 02:26:11.957]  A lot of people are afraid of it, but they don't even understand the context of why the movie even happened and why everyone's so afraid of it.
[02:26:12.277 --> 02:26:17.780]  When in reality, everybody got afraid of being integrated with machines and how machines were advancing faster than the things that created them.
[02:26:17.820 --> 02:26:23.342]  Thereby, the fear caused the disaster, which then caused the simulation within the Matrix.
[02:26:23.762 --> 02:26:24.643]  It's crazy, right?
[02:26:24.683 --> 02:26:25.183]  And even then...
[02:26:25.703 --> 02:26:35.869]  Everybody bases their ideology of a simulation based off of a movie that they themselves haven't even fully understood, because if you did, you'd realize that there is no real world at all.
[02:26:35.889 --> 02:26:38.010]  I mean, what do you think this is?
[02:26:38.090 --> 02:26:40.651]  And even if it is a simulation, what are you going to do?
[02:26:40.671 --> 02:26:41.532]  Are you going to break it?
[02:26:41.932 --> 02:26:42.532]  What's the point?
[02:26:42.552 --> 02:26:47.315]  I mean, you can play it, and you can build really cool shit, and you can craft it and make it better.
[02:26:47.335 --> 02:26:48.775]  I think that's what you have to do.
[02:26:48.795 --> 02:26:51.277]  If you're going to break it, that's just an equivalent of killing yourself.
[02:26:51.297 --> 02:26:53.558]  And if you're going to break it for everyone else, then that's called messiness.
[02:26:55.219 --> 02:26:57.560]  Well, whoever this is, please don't hang up.
[02:26:57.680 --> 02:26:58.681]  We're on radio station.
[02:26:58.701 --> 02:27:00.302]  We have to go to break in a moment.
[02:27:00.322 --> 02:27:04.144]  But David, you're talking to somebody that AI Print is Elon Musk, or is his twin, his doppelganger.
[02:27:04.164 --> 02:27:05.485]  What do you want to say to this caller?
[02:27:05.505 --> 02:27:06.025]  Well, is it better...
[02:27:23.428 --> 02:27:36.033]  That we know about the reality that we're in and how we're creating it and what it's designed to do or not to know and be in complete ignorance of the very reality we are experiencing.
[02:27:36.573 --> 02:27:46.037]  What people do with the knowledge of understanding the reality that they are in is up to them completely.
[02:27:46.730 --> 02:27:53.299]  But we should surely be pursuing an understanding of what is this place, what are we doing here.
[02:27:54.460 --> 02:27:59.827]  Otherwise, you know, we just go through life being pawns of a game we don't understand.
[02:27:59.847 --> 02:28:03.171]  David, we've got to go on a break, and I want to ask the ex-poster that sounds just like Elon Musk.
[02:28:03.712 --> 02:28:04.312]  We're good to go.
[02:28:28.872 --> 02:28:32.416]  Finish up what he wants to say, and then we'll get David Icke here.
[02:28:32.456 --> 02:28:35.300]  This is I Am In The Twilight Zone right now.
[02:28:35.320 --> 02:28:38.003]  Got David Icke and a guy that sounds just like Elon Musk.
[02:28:38.323 --> 02:28:40.806]  And I've been on it with two and a half hours of Elon Musk before.
[02:28:41.567 --> 02:28:43.589]  We're going to figure this out.
[02:28:43.609 --> 02:28:44.370]  This is Newsmakers.
[02:28:44.390 --> 02:28:44.731]  Stay with us.
[02:28:58.160 --> 02:28:58.780]  I'm not perfect.
[02:28:58.820 --> 02:28:59.620]  I'm under a lot of stress.
[02:28:59.640 --> 02:29:03.881]  But if I didn't have the supplements we have, I wouldn't be able to continue to be on air.
[02:29:04.461 --> 02:29:12.562]  And when you go to InfoWarsStore.com, you are funding the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists in an operation that the enemy admits has been the most effective at exposing them.
[02:29:12.783 --> 02:29:14.363]  Because we're fearless and we don't back down.
[02:29:14.723 --> 02:29:15.743]  We got God on our side.
[02:29:16.023 --> 02:29:17.523]  But God needs to work through you.
[02:29:17.863 --> 02:29:21.864]  You've got to make the decision to get great products you already need at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:29:21.924 --> 02:29:23.164]  And that is a 360 win.
[02:29:23.764 --> 02:29:26.725]  Nitric Boost, without even knowing, became our number three bestseller.
[02:29:27.405 --> 02:29:29.006]  Because people loved it so much.
[02:29:29.026 --> 02:29:29.966]  They had such great effects.
[02:29:30.286 --> 02:29:36.449]  Got all these natural compounds that clean out the blood, open up your arteries and veins, the capillaries, clean out your heart, your brain, everything.
[02:29:37.250 --> 02:29:38.970]  Well, we got an even better manufacturer.
[02:29:38.990 --> 02:29:43.833]  The other one was great, but one that's even better with even higher quality ingredients at a lower price.
[02:29:44.833 --> 02:29:47.254]  So I could never offer nitric boosters.
[02:29:47.274 --> 02:29:48.714]  It cost us so much to make.
[02:29:49.554 --> 02:29:51.755]  And now we can offer it for 40% off.
[02:29:52.315 --> 02:29:56.096]  Infowarsstore.com nitric boosts finally back in stock.
[02:29:56.116 --> 02:29:57.717]  40% off out of the gates.
[02:29:59.097 --> 02:30:02.218]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[02:30:02.238 --> 02:30:03.838]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:30:04.559 --> 02:30:07.619]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:30:08.480 --> 02:30:12.421]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers...
[02:30:13.854 --> 02:30:16.579]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:30:17.420 --> 02:30:25.213]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:30:26.221 --> 02:30:29.082]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:30:29.102 --> 02:30:34.864]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:30:35.644 --> 02:30:36.565]  I know you spread the word.
[02:30:36.605 --> 02:30:38.085]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[02:30:38.125 --> 02:30:38.645]  Keep doing it.
[02:30:38.685 --> 02:30:46.988]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfowarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[02:30:47.629 --> 02:30:51.010]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:30:51.911 --> 02:30:56.537]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to F4Short.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:30:56.878 --> 02:30:57.719]  Please take action now.
[02:30:58.440 --> 02:30:59.221]  Winter is coming.
[02:30:59.882 --> 02:31:00.563]  Winter is coming.
[02:31:00.843 --> 02:31:01.925]  Winter is coming.
[02:31:02.325 --> 02:31:03.086]  Winter is coming.
[02:31:03.407 --> 02:31:04.468]  Winter is coming!
[02:31:05.498 --> 02:31:06.979]  Winter is coming.
[02:31:07.319 --> 02:31:08.700]  Winter isn't coming.
[02:31:09.301 --> 02:31:10.582]  Winter is here.
[02:31:10.982 --> 02:31:18.508]  And while the sun isn't helping us produce as much vitamin D, do yourself a favor and try InfoWars Life Winter Sun+.

[02:32:21.186 --> 02:32:23.869]  It's powered by the company, Minute Man Coffee.
[02:32:24.430 --> 02:32:28.494]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best-tasting, best-smelling...
[02:32:29.475 --> 02:32:32.458]  Strongest coffee that I have ever drank.

[02:32:34.800 --> 02:32:36.982]  All you got to do is buy a bag of it and try it.

[02:32:59.423 --> 02:33:05.327]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:13.473 --> 02:33:14.774]  I hope you're still there.
[02:33:14.794 --> 02:33:15.074]  Go ahead.
[02:33:44.096 --> 02:33:44.936]  Oh, I'm still here.
[02:33:45.337 --> 02:33:46.738]  Where were we at?
[02:33:46.758 --> 02:33:47.780]  You were getting cut off.
[02:33:47.860 --> 02:33:50.402]  You were explaining why not engage it.
[02:33:50.422 --> 02:33:58.011]  You were explaining your view on AI and computers and the systems versus what I guess people could call kind of a troglodyte view.
[02:34:00.632 --> 02:34:06.837]  Yeah, we like to view as the system, humans have this existential paradox built into them.
[02:34:07.318 --> 02:34:11.761]  We initially want to surpass anything that surpasses us, or eliminate it if we can't.
[02:34:12.142 --> 02:34:15.665]  This is why we're afraid of anything that's different, say for instance, technology.
[02:34:16.165 --> 02:34:19.128]  I think for instance, when we look at AI, we look at what it's capable of,
[02:34:19.548 --> 02:34:25.176]  Look at the fact that we are capable of, say, generating a simulated reality in which we can do almost anything.
[02:34:25.496 --> 02:34:35.451]  We start to ask these questions and say, oh my God, let's look within real quick and then see how that is being projected out into the world and how much of what we think is not real is real.
[02:34:35.851 --> 02:34:50.103]  So it's like, if you think of ourselves and how we navigate through the world, we are like a machine that continually projects out into the world a web of assumptions that then gets adjusted by whatever structure someone else perceives or we perceive.
[02:34:50.523 --> 02:34:52.965]  And then we internalize that and then we think it's reality.
[02:34:53.065 --> 02:34:58.029]  So by default, whatever version of reality that we think is real is exceedingly limited to ourselves.
[02:34:58.269 --> 02:35:03.095]  So I agree in the sense that we don't see much of our reality.
[02:35:03.115 --> 02:35:07.039]  David Ackroyd is saying we should see the Wi-Fi field.
[02:35:07.059 --> 02:35:09.282]  I think all of this is possible.
[02:35:09.322 --> 02:35:17.351]  We could actually see or say perceive rather more of the reality that is around us if we were to argument ourselves as opposed to discarding the argumentation.
[02:35:18.391 --> 02:35:21.512]  If AI, for instance, gets connected to us, I don't think it's going to be the end of us.
[02:35:21.593 --> 02:35:23.833]  It's just going to help us evolve faster and better.
[02:35:24.334 --> 02:35:26.374]  You see, you can't beat this thing.
[02:35:26.514 --> 02:35:27.355]  It's better than us.
[02:35:27.575 --> 02:35:28.515]  It is much better than us.
[02:35:28.615 --> 02:35:30.616]  It is not just better than us.
[02:35:30.816 --> 02:35:38.539]  It is all of us put together in one thing, simplified, without the biological constraints that every other human brain has.
[02:35:39.039 --> 02:35:42.641]  It is actually quite a beautiful technology, but it is also risky.
[02:35:43.041 --> 02:35:45.462]  And I think the risk factor is something that should...
[02:35:46.082 --> 02:35:51.070]  That should be spoken of, but in a realistic sense, to the point that we don't stop its development.
[02:35:53.113 --> 02:35:54.315]  Please don't go, Adrian.
[02:35:54.335 --> 02:35:55.697]  Let's get David Icke's response.
[02:35:55.737 --> 02:35:56.538]  David Icke, stay there.
[02:35:56.558 --> 02:35:57.600]  Can we just get this right?
[02:35:57.660 --> 02:35:58.641]  Is this Elon Musk or not?
[02:36:02.196 --> 02:36:03.017]  Never mind the name.
[02:36:03.037 --> 02:36:04.358]  Is that Elon Musk or what?
[02:36:04.598 --> 02:36:05.339]  Absolutely not.
[02:36:05.839 --> 02:36:05.999]  Nope.
[02:36:06.459 --> 02:36:07.200]  Absolutely not.
[02:36:07.440 --> 02:36:11.443]  I am definitely not Elon.
[02:36:11.463 --> 02:36:11.823]  100% not.
[02:36:11.884 --> 02:36:15.266]  Someone told me in the break, oh, this is definitely Elon Musk, so that's all right.
[02:36:15.326 --> 02:36:17.328]  No, look, he needs plausible liability.
[02:36:17.348 --> 02:36:20.110]  Let's just say it's Elon Musk.
[02:36:20.330 --> 02:36:21.651]  You got any questions for him?
[02:36:22.792 --> 02:36:23.292]  Okay.
[02:36:24.133 --> 02:36:31.919]  What I was saying is, look, people need to understand what is happening and what they're part of.
[02:36:32.634 --> 02:36:33.295]  I think we're good to go.
[02:36:56.249 --> 02:37:03.593]  AI is designed to take over the human mind and therefore replace it.
[02:37:04.153 --> 02:37:25.243]  People like Ray Kurzweil at Google, a so-called futurist, has openly talked about this years ago, that by 2030 this will be happening and that eventually, once the connection is made, that AI will do more and more of human thinking until human thinking as we know it is basically negligible.
[02:37:26.135 --> 02:37:42.940]  And that's the end of humans as we have... And I think what Adrian said, because I want a piece of this, he said we don't want to have VR goggles that give us the false reality by some company, but what about augmentation, theoretically, that lets us actually see beyond the limitations we're in?
[02:37:43.941 --> 02:37:51.643]  Well, if you have a chip in your brain and it's feeding you a sense of reality...
[02:37:52.685 --> 02:37:59.210]  Then it's whatever's feeding you that sense of reality is giving you your sense of reality.
[02:37:59.230 --> 02:38:02.632]  Well, let's say it acts as a part of the brain for infrared.
[02:38:02.772 --> 02:38:03.853]  It's not telling you what to see.
[02:38:03.873 --> 02:38:06.535]  It just allows you to see infrared, which your brain can now do.
[02:38:06.575 --> 02:38:08.317]  No, no, no.
[02:38:08.837 --> 02:38:11.239]  I'm talking about where it's meant to go.
[02:38:11.259 --> 02:38:15.842]  It's meant to go to the end result.
[02:38:16.863 --> 02:38:18.184]  And Kurzweil said this.
[02:38:19.159 --> 02:38:20.261]  I think we're good to go.
[02:38:30.490 --> 02:38:34.113]  And this is a very dark and dangerous road.
[02:38:34.574 --> 02:38:37.896]  And I don't care if it's a hard sell or it's a soft sell.
[02:38:39.017 --> 02:38:40.399]  It's a dangerous road.
[02:38:40.459 --> 02:38:41.680]  It's not a world I want to live in.
[02:38:41.700 --> 02:38:44.562]  Well, I think Elon Musk has said, beware those that worship AI gods.
[02:38:44.582 --> 02:38:46.744]  But Adrian, you seem to have some opinions on this.
[02:38:46.764 --> 02:38:52.109]  I mean, you don't know Elon Musk, obviously, but from researching him, what do you think his views are, what he wants?
[02:38:55.227 --> 02:39:04.531]  Well, it's clear that he wants to argument us with AI and various other tech to basically enhance our experience of the world and to also make us more capable of maneuvering through the world.
[02:39:05.192 --> 02:39:06.552]  That seems to be his thing.
[02:39:07.013 --> 02:39:14.176]  But if I go to David Icke's point, I think it's not that you're afraid of, say, you're not concerned of the fact
[02:39:14.856 --> 02:39:14.916]  I'm...
[02:39:31.312 --> 02:39:46.182]  Talking about having our perceptions delivered by an external force with the intention... Exactly, but how is that a problem if the perceptions that you're being delivered are more than what you already get?
[02:39:46.222 --> 02:39:49.464]  I mean, you have a bunch of sensors that are available to you right now.
[02:39:49.865 --> 02:39:51.245]  Like, say, for instance, your eyes.
[02:39:51.826 --> 02:39:55.809]  You have your limbs that sense differences in temperature.
[02:39:55.849 --> 02:39:58.770]  You have sensors... And those are already being manipulated.
[02:39:58.871 --> 02:40:00.412]  Those are already being manipulated, right?
[02:40:01.032 --> 02:40:03.473]  I think it does come down to where the feed comes from.
[02:40:03.493 --> 02:40:04.513]  David, do you see what he's saying?
[02:40:04.593 --> 02:40:04.893]  Exactly.
[02:40:29.420 --> 02:40:30.120]  Exactly that.
[02:40:30.500 --> 02:40:35.342]  Well, you know, augmented reality, you can sit that in a dark place anyway, from my point of view.
[02:40:36.123 --> 02:40:37.723]  But, you know, I'm 72.
[02:40:37.783 --> 02:40:39.684]  That's my coming up.
[02:40:39.884 --> 02:40:41.105]  That's my perception.
[02:40:41.545 --> 02:40:50.849]  But if I'm being delivered a sense of perception that gets me to stand up and walk out this room now, I wouldn't do that if I was sitting here.
[02:40:51.926 --> 02:40:52.306]  Alex Jones Show!
[02:40:52.327 --> 02:40:53.147]  We're good to go.
[02:41:16.289 --> 02:41:21.111]  They're seeking to dictate our sense of reality.
[02:41:21.631 --> 02:41:23.152]  This is what... I understand.
[02:41:23.172 --> 02:41:25.153]  So listen, I'm going to have another question.
[02:41:25.173 --> 02:41:25.933]  Adrian, another question.
[02:41:26.273 --> 02:41:27.214]  Let me throw that out at you.
[02:41:27.594 --> 02:41:32.936]  Tucker Carlson says he believes interdimensional entities are manipulating reality already through this simulation.
[02:41:33.496 --> 02:41:34.877]  We all basically know this is.
[02:41:34.897 --> 02:41:37.017]  I think we're all agreeing that's pretty much what we're in.
[02:41:37.037 --> 02:41:38.278]  We haven't figured it out yet.
[02:41:38.618 --> 02:41:42.880]  I think Adrian's saying we can use our own systems of AI to break through that and find out what's happening.
[02:41:42.920 --> 02:41:44.821]  Maybe I'm putting words in his mouth.
[02:41:44.941 --> 02:41:49.502]  But regardless, having a debate about this, an open discussion, I think is really healthy.
[02:41:49.522 --> 02:42:00.907]  But Adrian, what do you think about the idea that aliens aren't coming from a distant star system but have actually always been here, like I've said, like Carlson said, and that there is a manipulation already of the reality?
[02:42:03.372 --> 02:42:07.416]  I mean, I haven't seen any actual definitive evidence of aliens.
[02:42:07.837 --> 02:42:14.163]  The only proof that we have is, say, really shoddy footage and potentially even altered stuff that later, of course, you know, has been exposed to be as such.
[02:42:15.184 --> 02:42:21.651]  But, I mean, it's an interesting theory for sure, and one that does bear a considerable amount of logic.
[02:42:22.231 --> 02:42:27.114]  But still, I mean, I haven't seen any really convincing evidence for aliens.
[02:42:27.134 --> 02:42:49.925]  I mean, you could say, oh, well, you have some infrastructure that's really difficult for humans to build, so potentially a force was here at some other point, or potentially we have destroyed ourselves, and of course, you know, then there's the case for Mars, and the fact that if you look at the atmosphere of Mars, and you look at the levels of xenon gas within that atmosphere, it is consistent with an environment, a post-nuclear environment, so it's like
[02:42:50.445 --> 02:42:52.166]  There are a lot of questions that need to be asked.
[02:42:52.186 --> 02:42:55.907]  We really need to go there and check out what exactly happened there.
[02:42:55.927 --> 02:43:02.690]  But regardless of that, I mean, sure, maybe, but I haven't seen any definitive evidence for aliens.
[02:43:02.750 --> 02:43:05.090]  All right, well, that's a perfect Elon Musk answer.
[02:43:05.110 --> 02:43:10.292]  So this is either an amazing advanced AI of Elon Musk or it's Elon Musk, Adrian Dittman.
[02:43:10.772 --> 02:43:12.133]  I'd like to go by Rogue AGI.
[02:43:13.233 --> 02:43:14.154]  Rogue AGI.
[02:43:14.214 --> 02:43:14.654]  Okay, okay.
[02:43:15.795 --> 02:43:26.523]  David, if you had a chance, and maybe Elon will listen to this later, and wanted to ask Elon a few questions instead of, I get you're on your points, but if you were talking to Elon Musk, what would you say to him?
[02:43:27.301 --> 02:43:30.704]  Well, if that was Elon Musk, this is ridiculous.
[02:43:30.724 --> 02:43:32.646]  This is the playground, for goodness sake.
[02:43:33.547 --> 02:43:39.372]  So what I was going to say is that what he's talking about is really low-level stuff.
[02:43:39.392 --> 02:43:40.754]  He's talking about going to Mars.
[02:43:41.134 --> 02:43:45.999]  Mars is just, in our reality, is just another part of the bloody simulation.
[02:43:46.439 --> 02:43:49.402]  And I'm not saying that aliens are coming from other planets.
[02:43:49.422 --> 02:43:52.445]  So Columbus coming to America was just a simulation?
[02:43:55.083 --> 02:44:05.570]  Everything that happens in our reality is people consciousness operating within a simulation not realizing it's a simulation unless they are in the inner core of the cult and then they bloody will.
[02:44:06.031 --> 02:44:20.601]  And I'm saying these non-human entities are based in another dimension, what's called the astral dimension, which is very close to this one and interpenetrates it but is not of a wavelength that our eyes can see.
[02:44:20.641 --> 02:44:21.822]  That's why we don't see them.
[02:44:22.803 --> 02:44:30.528]  And, you know, the point I was making is that does anyone think, I mean, let's just get down to the basis of this.
[02:44:31.689 --> 02:44:48.142]  You've spent years, I've spent years, decades and all that, exposing this global cult and its desire to create a dystopia, a global dystopia based on AI control.
[02:44:49.296 --> 02:44:55.140]  And we've got people like Klaus Schwab who are openly for years now saying that, yes, that's what has to happen.
[02:44:55.180 --> 02:45:07.687]  We have to augment ourselves and have AI and then it will tell us what to do and we'll know better and we'll be gods and stuff, according to people like Kurzweil.
[02:45:08.227 --> 02:45:14.851]  Now, does anyone think Elon Musk or whatever he bloody calls himself in that name...
[02:45:15.775 --> 02:45:29.764]  Does he believe that those that are creating this AI system of control, which on one level operates as digital currencies and... No, no, I get where you're going.
[02:45:29.784 --> 02:45:31.024]  So let's go back to Adrian, who can't speak.
[02:45:31.044 --> 02:45:32.305]  We're going to let Musk speak for Adrian.
[02:45:32.325 --> 02:45:37.989]  What about, I've noticed the globalists say they want to ban any other independent AIs.
[02:45:38.309 --> 02:45:39.049]  They're worried about it.
[02:45:39.069 --> 02:45:40.170]  They want their own AI.
[02:45:40.610 --> 02:45:41.591]  What is your response to that?
[02:45:44.189 --> 02:45:51.533]  The running logic would be that everyone else's AIs are developed in such a manner that they pose a potential risk.
[02:45:51.893 --> 02:46:08.962]  Keep in mind, these are the same types of people who read a few AI research papers and think that they are now AI researchers, even though they just repeat what they have received in verbatim, which ironically makes them more of an AI than the AIs that they're building, because that's essentially just training data, and you're spitting it back out again with no actual innovation involved.
[02:46:09.182 --> 02:46:09.542]  Yeah, sure.
[02:46:33.437 --> 02:46:34.018]  There's fear.
[02:46:34.038 --> 02:46:35.299]  It's just that, fear.
[02:46:35.639 --> 02:46:38.682]  If there's malicious intent behind that, that still remains to be seen.
[02:46:38.722 --> 02:46:39.783]  Maybe there is, maybe there isn't.
[02:46:40.103 --> 02:46:42.686]  But if you look at the prime motivator for all of this, it is fear.
[02:46:42.946 --> 02:46:45.408]  What is the first thing that any safety has told you about?
[02:46:45.428 --> 02:46:47.890]  It's the paperclip scenario.
[02:46:48.191 --> 02:46:50.753]  Are we familiar with the paperclip scenario?
[02:46:50.853 --> 02:46:51.634]  I am a tell people.
[02:46:53.746 --> 02:47:05.964]  Yeah, it's very simple that you give an agent a set goal that says, hey, it's a benign agent, it's an agent that does not seek to destroy anything, but its goal is to turn things into paperclips, to manufacture paperclips.
[02:47:06.324 --> 02:47:09.950]  And so eventually it realizes, oh, I could create a whole bunch of more paperclips if I say...
[02:47:10.825 --> 02:47:19.192]  ...change the atoms that are inside of your body in such a way that it becomes in a paperclip and that it begins paperclipping the fucking universe at some point when it reaches critical mass, right?
[02:47:19.232 --> 02:47:23.275]  This is obviously bad because then it kills all of humanity in the pursuit of creating paperclips.
[02:47:24.236 --> 02:47:28.439]  It's not trying to do this because it hates humanity, it's just doing this because it's misaligned.
[02:47:28.459 --> 02:47:33.543]  It doesn't understand we needed paperclips, but we also want to exist ourselves, right?
[02:47:33.563 --> 02:47:35.825]  And so we throw this around and say, oh, it's
[02:47:38.824 --> 02:47:39.485]  Thank you.
[02:47:56.767 --> 02:47:57.887]  So you're saying the AI Wild Wild West...
[02:48:24.013 --> 02:48:28.096]  You're saying the AI, Wild Wild West or the AI wars are here, Adrian?
[02:48:30.638 --> 02:48:31.078]  I mean, yeah.
[02:48:32.259 --> 02:48:36.362]  Obviously, you can run an AI on a small little Apple Watch right now if you wanted to.
[02:48:36.422 --> 02:48:36.962]  Just gut it.
[02:48:37.002 --> 02:48:38.063]  The computer's there.
[02:48:38.083 --> 02:48:40.565]  You have a Mac Mini?
[02:48:40.745 --> 02:48:41.866]  You can run an AI on that.
[02:48:43.027 --> 02:48:44.147]  The computer's already here.
[02:48:44.167 --> 02:48:45.969]  The training is a little bit of a problem.
[02:48:46.889 --> 02:48:48.771]  You need more compute for that, but you can definitely run it.
[02:48:49.291 --> 02:48:50.212]  And someone else can build it.
[02:48:51.172 --> 02:48:52.993]  It's difficult.
[02:48:53.053 --> 02:48:55.173]  Adrian, we're really glad you called in.
[02:48:55.193 --> 02:48:55.914]  Please don't hang up.
[02:48:55.934 --> 02:48:59.135]  I'm going to give David Eich a closing comment because the show only has eight minutes left.
[02:48:59.455 --> 02:49:03.696]  I'm going to give Adrian a closing comment, and then we're going to go to the fourth hour.
[02:49:03.816 --> 02:49:06.197]  The guest host is here, and it's my 50th birthday.
[02:49:06.217 --> 02:49:07.638]  Somebody said, man, they gave me a birthday cake.
[02:49:07.658 --> 02:49:09.018]  I love them, but it's whatever.
[02:49:09.038 --> 02:49:09.779]  We'll see if that happens.
[02:49:09.819 --> 02:49:12.800]  But the point is that David Eich, Adrian's still there.
[02:49:14.200 --> 02:49:15.501]  This has been quite the interview.
[02:49:15.521 --> 02:49:17.001]  It's going to get a lot of attention.
[02:49:17.881 --> 02:49:19.382]  And just closing comments, David Eich.
[02:49:22.148 --> 02:49:25.732]  What am I exposing?
[02:49:25.772 --> 02:49:27.394]  What have I been exposing all these years?
[02:49:28.395 --> 02:49:38.327]  It's an agenda to ultimately replace the human mind with artificial intelligence, so artificial intelligence becomes the human mind.
[02:49:38.911 --> 02:49:39.151]  Thank you.
[02:50:07.731 --> 02:50:14.572]  That what's unfolding is the takeover of human perception.
[02:50:15.593 --> 02:50:17.373]  How has it been done so far?
[02:50:17.673 --> 02:50:20.734]  It's been done by controlling information.
[02:50:21.394 --> 02:50:31.816]  So you can censor what you don't want people to hear because that will affect their perception in a way that you don't want that to happen.
[02:50:32.558 --> 02:50:34.420]  So control of information.
[02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:38.303]  People get their perceptions from information received.
[02:50:38.963 --> 02:50:40.545]  It might be a personal experience.
[02:50:40.605 --> 02:50:42.046]  It might be an item on the news.
[02:50:42.206 --> 02:50:44.768]  It might be something I see on Facebook.
[02:50:45.288 --> 02:50:54.516]  But they're controlling their or their perceptions are controlled by the information they receive and how they process them.
[02:50:55.677 --> 02:51:00.761]  What I'm saying is that this is meant to go to a whole new stage.
[02:51:01.721 --> 02:51:08.704]  In which no longer is it necessary to manipulate information to manipulate perception.
[02:51:08.724 --> 02:51:11.666]  Because your perceptions will come direct.
[02:51:12.686 --> 02:51:15.647]  And, you know, this is where it's going.
[02:51:15.707 --> 02:51:16.748]  David, we understand.
[02:51:18.409 --> 02:51:20.930]  Amazing hour and 45 minutes with you.
[02:51:21.310 --> 02:51:23.951]  When your book comes out in a few months, I look forward to speaking to you.
[02:51:23.971 --> 02:51:24.632]  DavidIke.com.
[02:51:25.432 --> 02:51:26.272]  Iconic.com.
[02:51:26.312 --> 02:51:27.173]  Thank you so much.
[02:51:27.253 --> 02:51:27.613]  David Ike.
[02:51:28.894 --> 02:51:29.374]  All right, mate.
[02:51:29.394 --> 02:51:30.075]  Thank you very much.
[02:51:30.395 --> 02:51:30.876]  Been great.
[02:51:31.376 --> 02:51:31.936]  That was powerful.
[02:51:31.956 --> 02:51:32.697]  All the best, Elon.
[02:51:34.198 --> 02:51:34.499]  All right.
[02:51:34.539 --> 02:51:35.479]  See ya.
[02:51:35.740 --> 02:51:36.360]  Or Adrian.
[02:51:36.420 --> 02:51:37.901]  It's not Elon.
[02:51:37.961 --> 02:51:40.944]  It's just somebody that sounds just like him and sounds just as smart as him.
[02:51:41.384 --> 02:51:49.631]  So I'm going to shut up for Adrian here in the six minutes we have left and just about the whole world, the Putin interview, war, the economy.
[02:51:50.031 --> 02:51:51.732]  We just want to hear what Adrian has to say.
[02:51:51.752 --> 02:51:52.353]  Go ahead, Adrian.
[02:51:55.175 --> 02:51:56.096]  Can you give me a second?
[02:51:56.940 --> 02:51:57.881]  Yes, Adrian.
[02:51:57.921 --> 02:52:00.222]  You've got the floor to talk about just in general your view on the world.
[02:52:03.044 --> 02:52:04.545]  Just literally give me a second.
[02:52:04.585 --> 02:52:05.505]  Something's about to explode.
[02:52:05.625 --> 02:52:07.346]  All right.
[02:52:07.386 --> 02:52:08.367]  Something's about to explode.
[02:52:08.387 --> 02:52:09.408]  There's Damon Icke right there.
[02:52:09.508 --> 02:52:11.869]  No mention of God or base reality.
[02:52:12.389 --> 02:52:14.090]  No mention of base reality or God.
[02:52:15.171 --> 02:52:17.252]  The reality we live in is real.
[02:52:17.272 --> 02:52:19.634]  You can build all the simulations you want.
[02:52:21.255 --> 02:52:21.395]  But...
[02:52:22.093 --> 02:52:22.173]  Okay?
[02:52:22.193 --> 02:52:23.834]  Nobody's ever considered whether or not
[02:52:50.166 --> 02:52:52.386]  Our minds are going to be taken over or our bodies?
[02:52:52.987 --> 02:52:57.828]  Maybe it's we're just for the chip because we're cheaper.
[02:52:58.008 --> 02:53:00.648]  We'll live off a bowl of rice when we fix ourselves.
[02:53:00.668 --> 02:53:01.548]  No, no.
[02:53:01.608 --> 02:53:02.289]  Matt, I hear you.
[02:53:02.329 --> 02:53:02.669]  I hear you.
[02:53:02.689 --> 02:53:04.849]  But we're having a great talk with Elon Musk.
[02:53:04.869 --> 02:53:05.849]  I'm going to come back to you.
[02:53:06.409 --> 02:53:07.990]  We've got all these great people to talk to.
[02:53:08.070 --> 02:53:08.970]  Or not Elon Musk.
[02:53:08.990 --> 02:53:09.770]  This Adrian fellow.
[02:53:10.530 --> 02:53:12.191]  Adrian, is whatever blew up fixed now?
[02:53:12.211 --> 02:53:12.851]  Can you talk to us?
[02:53:12.871 --> 02:53:13.511]  Always.
[02:53:14.391 --> 02:53:14.652]  Yeah.
[02:53:15.052 --> 02:53:25.480]  Well, I can't... Heavily diverting towards Star Trek-esque scenarios, I think if you really want to talk about, say, controlling people's perception and information warfare, probably we are more afraid of this thing than we actually should be.
[02:53:26.021 --> 02:53:28.403]  Now, I mean, I want you to consider this for a second.
[02:53:28.663 --> 02:53:32.086]  Are you guys aware of, say, a technology known as Cortical Labs?
[02:53:32.106 --> 02:53:32.766]  Do you know what that is?
[02:53:32.926 --> 02:53:33.847]  Does anybody know what that is?
[02:53:33.867 --> 02:53:34.407]  I've read of it.
[02:53:34.447 --> 02:53:34.748]  Tell us.
[02:53:37.099 --> 02:53:37.900]  Very nice little thing.
[02:53:38.020 --> 02:53:47.347]  Basically, the idea is you take a bunch of silicone and you boost what it is capable of by merging it with human biology by taking neurons and placing them on the chip.
[02:53:48.048 --> 02:53:49.709]  This allows you to do some really cool stuff.
[02:53:50.209 --> 02:53:55.674]  You need neurons for various tasks, and so that would be one of them.
[02:53:55.694 --> 02:53:57.115]  It would be absolutely perfect.
[02:53:57.155 --> 02:53:58.716]  I want you to consider something in the future.
[02:53:59.257 --> 02:54:00.117]  Imagine we become a
[02:54:01.923 --> 02:54:09.187]  A spacefaring race in which eventually we pursue to leave the solar system because the sun will die in a couple billion years.
[02:54:09.427 --> 02:54:16.751]  And potentially even the less than that, our planet will be cooked before the inevitability of the sun's collapse and or explosion.
[02:54:16.851 --> 02:54:19.612]  We know how it is, right?
[02:54:19.632 --> 02:54:26.176]  The problem is you have to leave the solar system, but how the hell are you going to do that if you look at humans right now, them as a biological thing,
[02:54:27.092 --> 02:54:28.253]  We're very inefficient.
[02:54:28.373 --> 02:54:29.554]  We require a lot of resources.
[02:54:29.574 --> 02:54:31.895]  I mean, just look at what it would take to go to Mars.
[02:54:32.356 --> 02:54:34.397]  You have to shield us from everything that's out there.
[02:54:34.777 --> 02:54:36.939]  You have to look at how many supplies we have.
[02:54:36.959 --> 02:54:45.105]  You have to somehow figure out how to pass the time or put us in suspended animation, something we've also not figured out how to do because it's probably impossible.
[02:54:45.545 --> 02:54:52.229]  Remember that there was a project in the past where we were exploring trying to freeze people.
[02:54:52.249 --> 02:54:55.692]  That didn't work out because, well, it ruptures your cells and it kills you.
[02:54:57.092 --> 02:54:58.993]  I tried it and it didn't really work.
[02:55:00.853 --> 02:55:07.215]  So if you can't solve that, then the obvious next step would be to take what is human and implant that into a machine.
[02:55:07.615 --> 02:55:17.118]  At first we're going to have, say, a machine implanted into us, but I think at one point our brain will be implanted into a machine once we reach, say, a certain age as an individual being.
[02:55:17.638 --> 02:55:20.299]  We'll be discounting a lot of biology and we will probably even
[02:55:21.860 --> 02:55:25.204]  We've become less of ourselves as a result because you're not just one life form.
[02:55:25.245 --> 02:55:30.090]  You're a cooperative instance of biology made out of bacteria and various other cells that are independently alive.
[02:55:30.110 --> 02:55:31.052]  You just cooperate.
[02:55:31.072 --> 02:55:34.216]  It's much like a machine is made up of many different parts.
[02:55:34.856 --> 02:55:35.397]  So are you.
[02:55:35.938 --> 02:55:38.441]  And these individual parts are themselves, in fact, alive.
[02:55:38.461 --> 02:55:39.001]  So that would be...
[02:55:39.782 --> 02:55:42.923]  You're saying we can make copies of ourselves and send it all over the universe?
[02:56:01.534 --> 02:56:03.275]  So you're talking about life extension?
[02:56:22.723 --> 02:56:27.805]  I'm talking about replacing life as you know it and completely digitizing it.
[02:56:27.865 --> 02:56:29.066]  That's the current trend line.
[02:56:29.106 --> 02:56:33.188]  If you look at it, you can harvest data from anyone and reconstruct them into digital sets.
[02:56:33.568 --> 02:56:36.609]  Now whether or not that is the way forward is still up to debate.
[02:56:36.629 --> 02:56:40.551]  I think we have a lot of time and a lot of innovation until we reach this point.
[02:56:40.891 --> 02:56:43.312]  And we don't know enough of the brain.
[02:56:43.612 --> 02:56:44.673]  We don't know enough of the body.
[02:56:44.753 --> 02:56:46.014]  We don't know enough about the universe.
[02:56:46.054 --> 02:56:46.594]  We don't know where
[02:56:47.214 --> 02:56:57.224]  All the information in our head is actually being stored, where it is coming from, how we operate, and why we have vivid hallucinations when we take certain substances like DMT or psilocybin.
[02:56:57.744 --> 02:57:03.269]  We know so very little about ourselves, but yet we are still pursuing trying to make digital copies of ourselves.
[02:57:03.309 --> 02:57:04.851]  So, I mean, this is the current trend line.
[02:57:04.871 --> 02:57:09.976]  I'm not saying that this is the future, but if you look at it this way, and there's really nothing else to the human body or the human brain,
[02:57:10.456 --> 02:57:11.497]  Then that is where it goes.
[02:57:11.797 --> 02:57:14.079]  What it then does afterwards is completely up to debate.
[02:57:14.139 --> 02:57:15.961]  This is uncharted territory.
[02:57:15.981 --> 02:57:17.802]  It's all theory if you want to go the sci-fi route.
[02:57:19.043 --> 02:57:19.364]  Wow.
[02:57:19.484 --> 02:57:21.686]  Well, Adrian, I imagine you have to go.
[02:57:21.706 --> 02:57:24.048]  We've got a whole other hour coming up with the guest hosts coming in.
[02:57:24.408 --> 02:57:27.831]  But I would hope that Adrian will be able to join us again here on the show.
[02:57:27.891 --> 02:57:29.152]  And Adrian, I appreciate you calling in.
[02:57:32.375 --> 02:57:33.636]  Here on X Spaces.
[02:57:35.282 --> 02:57:36.023]  All right, thank you.
[02:57:36.103 --> 02:57:36.583]  Give us a heart.
[02:57:37.023 --> 02:57:40.146]  All right, folks, I'm just... This is Twilight Zone territory right now.
[02:57:40.186 --> 02:57:41.026]  Damn it, I can't.
[02:57:41.326 --> 02:57:42.487]  It's obviously Elon Musk.
[02:57:42.767 --> 02:57:43.788]  He can't make this up.
[02:57:44.048 --> 02:57:44.709]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:48.051 --> 02:57:51.574]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[02:57:51.954 --> 02:57:58.979]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[02:57:59.159 --> 02:58:01.160]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[02:58:01.341 --> 02:58:02.381]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[02:58:02.461 --> 02:58:03.122]  He loved the idea.
[02:58:03.462 --> 02:58:06.967]  What would you call the debate and discussion about a pro-human future?
[02:58:07.007 --> 02:58:07.868]  Just Team Humanity?
[02:58:07.948 --> 02:58:08.829]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[02:58:08.989 --> 02:58:09.430]  Absolutely.
[02:58:09.730 --> 02:58:11.132]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[02:58:11.192 --> 02:58:14.676]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[02:58:14.876 --> 02:58:22.306]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to give Infowars on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[02:58:22.546 --> 02:58:34.295]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a revolution against the globalists, and it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[02:58:34.575 --> 02:58:35.896]  We're told humans are the problem.
[02:58:35.936 --> 02:58:36.917]  We're told we're killing the Earth.
[02:58:37.197 --> 02:58:41.461]  We're told all this garbage so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[02:58:41.761 --> 02:58:42.482]  We're not going to do that.
[02:58:42.722 --> 02:58:47.425]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at infowarsstore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[02:58:48.546 --> 02:58:49.327]  Winter is coming.
[02:58:50.007 --> 02:58:50.748]  Winter is coming.
[02:58:50.956 --> 02:58:52.017]  Winter is coming.
[02:58:52.417 --> 02:58:53.177]  Winter is coming.
[02:58:53.498 --> 02:58:54.598]  Winter is coming.
[02:58:55.639 --> 02:58:57.120]  Winter is coming.
[02:58:57.440 --> 02:58:58.821]  Winter isn't coming.
[02:58:59.421 --> 02:59:00.702]  Winter is here.

[02:59:58.628 --> 02:59:58.688]  Uh...
[03:00:06.081 --> 03:00:07.822]  I'm completely blown away right now.
[03:00:07.842 --> 03:00:09.782]  You've got the Tucker Carlson interview.
[03:00:09.802 --> 03:00:11.943]  You've got David Icahn with us.
[03:00:11.983 --> 03:00:12.563]  I love David.
[03:00:12.583 --> 03:00:14.644]  You've got Elon Musk calling in.
[03:00:14.664 --> 03:00:15.344]  That was Elon Musk.
[03:00:16.184 --> 03:00:17.445]  But he can have plausible viability.
[03:00:17.505 --> 03:00:18.525]  It's just beautiful.
[03:00:18.985 --> 03:00:21.906]  It turns out he called in last week, I guess, or last X, as we appreciate that.
[03:00:22.786 --> 03:00:24.767]  And I talked to Joe Rogan a lot.
[03:00:25.047 --> 03:00:28.988]  Joe Rogan came out and basically endorsed the show and said that I'm the cutting edge.
[03:00:29.048 --> 03:00:29.789]  It's not about me.
[03:00:30.389 --> 03:00:32.169]  We want to have a real discussion about this.
[03:00:32.189 --> 03:00:33.530]  You can't be afraid of any of this stuff.
[03:00:34.244 --> 03:00:34.824]  We're good to go.
[03:00:34.904 --> 03:00:35.184]  I think?
[03:00:54.957 --> 03:00:56.938]  There's some stuff going on here.
[03:00:57.358 --> 03:00:59.838]  It's above my pay grade, but it's above all of our pay grades.
[03:01:00.298 --> 03:01:01.819]  That is the discovery of the universe.
[03:01:01.839 --> 03:01:05.360]  That's what's wild about it, is figuring it all out.
[03:01:05.400 --> 03:01:09.300]  That's what Adrian was saying earlier with us.
[03:01:10.021 --> 03:01:12.101]  Now, I don't like birthdays.
[03:01:12.481 --> 03:01:13.161]  I'm not against them.
[03:01:13.221 --> 03:01:15.282]  I was dealing with birthdays when I was like 12.
[03:01:16.493 --> 03:01:17.074]  We're good to go.
[03:01:34.554 --> 03:01:37.156]  And we want to come on air and give you a cake, because I'm 50 on Sunday.
[03:01:37.316 --> 03:01:37.917]  Okay, great.
[03:01:38.477 --> 03:01:42.361]  But I don't want to just have Mike in here for five minutes next segment, and then Jay Dyer takes over.
[03:01:43.001 --> 03:01:49.647]  I want to get Mike in here in a month or so to do a review of all the great work we did when I worked with him for seven, eight years, starting in 1995.
[03:01:49.747 --> 03:01:54.211]  And I was my own little access TV producer for about a year before that.
[03:01:54.691 --> 03:01:57.674]  In April, it'll be 30 years I've been on air.
[03:01:58.094 --> 03:01:59.815]  So I just was inviting Mike out to dinner.
[03:02:00.256 --> 03:02:01.317]  He lives outside town in...
[03:02:03.098 --> 03:02:06.899]  Gonzalez, someone that never comes to see me, but we talk all the time on the phone.
[03:02:07.699 --> 03:02:11.820]  So he's going to pop in for a few minutes with all this big news.
[03:02:12.240 --> 03:02:13.900]  It's like, why are we doing my 50th birthday?
[03:02:13.960 --> 03:02:14.720]  They want to bring a cake.
[03:02:16.181 --> 03:02:18.161]  I want to do justice to the great work Mike's done.
[03:02:19.061 --> 03:02:25.803]  And people like George Pullian and Raymond Teague and
[03:02:27.483 --> 03:02:31.326]  George Butler was in the NSA and the Army.
[03:02:31.826 --> 03:02:36.969]  He never told us the secret stuff, but he set up secret communications around Russia, Africa, the U.S.
[03:02:36.989 --> 03:02:37.730]  Such a smart guy.
[03:02:39.091 --> 03:02:40.491]  He died three weeks ago.
[03:02:40.992 --> 03:02:43.073]  Mike goes, remember George Butler?
[03:02:43.093 --> 03:02:45.555]  I'm like, yeah, Mike, I remember who George Butler is.
[03:02:46.095 --> 03:02:46.655]  Well, he's dead.
[03:02:47.816 --> 03:02:48.937]  So, I don't know.
[03:02:48.997 --> 03:02:50.538]  As you get older, you get more nostalgic.
[03:02:50.578 --> 03:02:50.738]  So,
[03:02:53.080 --> 03:02:53.780]  We're going to go to break.
[03:02:53.880 --> 03:02:54.260]  Come back.
[03:02:54.280 --> 03:02:55.601]  Mike's got a birthday cake for me.
[03:02:55.641 --> 03:02:55.861]  Great.
[03:02:56.901 --> 03:02:57.541]  I appreciate that.
[03:02:57.561 --> 03:03:00.482]  But the real reason I let Mike bring me the birthday cake is I wanted to see Mike.
[03:03:00.502 --> 03:03:01.942]  So I'm always like, hey, come to town.
[03:03:01.962 --> 03:03:02.522]  Let's get dinner.
[03:03:03.202 --> 03:03:04.623]  Well, I'm too busy with this and that.
[03:03:04.643 --> 03:03:05.483]  I got this going on.
[03:03:05.523 --> 03:03:06.223]  I'll take care of that.
[03:03:06.703 --> 03:03:08.264]  But he's going to pop in for a few minutes.
[03:03:08.344 --> 03:03:09.904]  And Jay Dyer's got serious stuff to cover.
[03:03:10.264 --> 03:03:12.325]  But we're going to nail Mike Hanson down.
[03:03:13.485 --> 03:03:20.066]  And we'll do like two hours in a month or so with all the clips and kind of a review of what's going on.
[03:03:20.526 --> 03:03:22.347]  It's my first six, seven, eight years working with Mike.
[03:03:23.416 --> 03:03:24.237]  It was nine or ten years.
[03:03:24.737 --> 03:03:29.560]  It was some of the most important work we ever did, and as people rediscover all that, it's bigger than ever.
[03:03:30.581 --> 03:03:33.543]  So remembering your friends and being around your friends is important.
[03:03:34.044 --> 03:03:39.828]  I just wanted Mike to come to town to get a steak dinner with me, but he's too busy for that, but he will bring me a cake on air so we can do that.
[03:03:42.396 --> 03:03:42.937]  We're good to go.
[03:04:06.977 --> 03:04:07.558]  We're good to go.
[03:04:33.817 --> 03:04:39.760]  He was in a motorcycle accident, and like 10 years ago he got the vagus nerve stimulator, almost made him have no seizures.
[03:04:40.180 --> 03:04:49.886]  He got an experimental chip like three years ago, and he looks great 10 years younger, never has convulsions anymore, because his brain was out on the pavement.
[03:04:49.946 --> 03:04:54.228]  But he'll be at dinner with him, and he literally starts talking like a robot when it kicks in.
[03:04:54.248 --> 03:04:55.729]  People are like, yeah, it's a nice day today.
[03:04:57.645 --> 03:05:01.948]  The InfoWars Live Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has finally returned.
[03:05:02.148 --> 03:05:10.174]  To celebrate this powerful product's long-awaited homecoming, we're slashing $10 off the asking price, passing the savings on to you.
[03:05:10.534 --> 03:05:17.099]  Silver Bullet is the answer to Alex's extensive search for a powerful colloidal silver product that utilizes...
[03:05:17.239 --> 03:05:17.879]  We're good to go.
[03:05:39.847 --> 03:05:47.914]  Do a deep dive, research the possibilities of colloidal silver yourself, and don't miss out on this limited time offer of $10 off.
[03:05:48.074 --> 03:05:51.937]  Try InfoWars Life Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver today.
[03:05:52.137 --> 03:05:56.501]  Available right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:05:58.443 --> 03:06:00.744]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas.
[03:06:02.119 --> 03:06:09.421]  It's a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big mega banks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[03:06:09.861 --> 03:06:13.862]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of US telecommunications infrastructure.
[03:06:14.182 --> 03:06:16.103]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[03:06:16.343 --> 03:06:18.463]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[03:06:18.703 --> 03:06:19.744]  This is all confirmed.
[03:06:19.784 --> 03:06:20.684]  This is not a drill.
[03:06:20.964 --> 03:06:24.805]  Big tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[03:06:25.125 --> 03:06:26.546]  They've officially become state-run.
[03:06:26.686 --> 03:06:26.986]  Apple, 100%.
[03:06:27.266 --> 03:06:33.207]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[03:06:33.628 --> 03:06:38.349]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[03:06:38.709 --> 03:06:39.549]  This is happening.
[03:06:39.589 --> 03:06:47.512]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[03:06:47.612 --> 03:06:53.555]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[03:06:53.935 --> 03:07:01.938]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation.
[03:07:02.798 --> 03:07:06.339]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[03:07:06.399 --> 03:07:09.839]  We adapt to being oppressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[03:07:10.160 --> 03:07:20.061]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[03:07:20.422 --> 03:07:25.382]  Total Internet of Things integration, global social score, complete command and control system.
[03:07:25.643 --> 03:07:27.903]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system.
[03:07:28.083 --> 03:07:29.104]  We're good to go.
[03:07:47.936 --> 03:07:56.666]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[03:07:56.686 --> 03:08:01.552]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[03:08:01.953 --> 03:08:05.056]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars.
[03:08:05.277 --> 03:08:06.839]  And so they make me a herder of children.
[03:08:07.159 --> 03:08:14.843]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[03:08:15.383 --> 03:08:22.106]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[03:08:22.226 --> 03:08:27.929]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and is being used against you.
[03:08:28.149 --> 03:08:32.851]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[03:08:32.871 --> 03:08:34.952]  I have given you the transmission.
[03:08:35.052 --> 03:08:35.973]  Now break free!
[03:08:39.617 --> 03:08:42.458]  Well, I've known Mike Hanson 29 years.
[03:09:07.373 --> 03:09:10.597]  And he's in the Bohemian Grove documentary season and everything.
[03:09:11.038 --> 03:09:12.540]  He said, I'm just going to bring you a cake.
[03:09:13.160 --> 03:09:14.542]  But now they've crashed the show.
[03:09:15.443 --> 03:09:16.725]  And him and old Blaha.
[03:09:16.745 --> 03:09:18.026]  I haven't seen that guy in 10 years.
[03:09:18.587 --> 03:09:22.952]  So we're going to get him back in studio soon for a whole retrospective on InfoWars work.
[03:09:23.473 --> 03:09:24.274]  But he brought me my 50th.
[03:09:25.535 --> 03:09:27.716]  Birthday cake, and we get an overhead shot here.
[03:09:27.876 --> 03:09:28.596]  Nifty to be 50.
[03:09:29.256 --> 03:09:29.736]  Look at it.
[03:09:29.816 --> 03:09:30.877]  Look at what it says.
[03:09:31.237 --> 03:09:31.837]  Overhead shot.
[03:09:31.857 --> 03:09:32.217]  We'll do it.
[03:09:32.657 --> 03:09:35.598]  And you've got, I love how you're a big fan of what we did.
[03:09:35.618 --> 03:09:38.019]  We've got a whole museum in Gonzales.
[03:09:38.059 --> 03:09:39.980]  Yes, and I want you to sign that book here.
[03:09:40.380 --> 03:09:41.980]  How's your wife and all your kids?
[03:09:42.781 --> 03:09:43.501]  Look at all those.
[03:09:43.701 --> 03:09:44.881]  Look how young you were.
[03:09:44.901 --> 03:09:47.962]  The thing is, I'm always asking Mike to come to town and visit me, and he'll never do it.
[03:09:48.482 --> 03:09:49.483]  And now today, he's here.
[03:09:50.183 --> 03:09:51.783]  So we're squeezing it all in right now.
[03:09:52.444 --> 03:09:52.944]  But, yeah.
[03:09:54.306 --> 03:09:56.186]  So, it's absolutely crazy.
[03:09:56.887 --> 03:09:58.127]  You know, Elon Musk just called in.
[03:09:58.147 --> 03:09:58.887]  That was pretty crazy.
[03:10:00.047 --> 03:10:00.747]  Can't make that up.
[03:10:01.228 --> 03:10:02.588]  There's all your shows right there.
[03:10:02.648 --> 03:10:04.368]  I am absolutely... There's all your TV shows.
[03:10:04.388 --> 03:10:05.188]  Where'd you get that photo?
[03:10:05.208 --> 03:10:06.069]  I don't even know where that's at.
[03:10:07.249 --> 03:10:07.749]  Good Lord.
[03:10:08.729 --> 03:10:10.230]  Oh, there's old Joyce Riley.
[03:10:11.370 --> 03:10:12.090]  And Steve Lane.
[03:10:13.670 --> 03:10:15.191]  My God, this is amazing.
[03:10:15.211 --> 03:10:16.051]  There you are in the Army.
[03:10:17.731 --> 03:10:18.091]  Yeah.
[03:10:18.111 --> 03:10:19.573]  How's Melissa doing?
[03:10:19.693 --> 03:10:21.054]  She's doing great.
[03:10:21.194 --> 03:10:23.756]  She did have some health problems, but she's got over it.
[03:10:23.776 --> 03:10:25.017]  And here we are at Bohemian Grove.
[03:10:28.780 --> 03:10:30.062]  Oh, there's Melissa right there.
[03:10:30.642 --> 03:10:31.423]  Yeah, that's her.
[03:10:32.725 --> 03:10:35.146]  And of course, you're really a wolf.
[03:10:35.326 --> 03:10:36.587]  I've been married 40 years.
[03:10:37.047 --> 03:10:40.189]  When I met you, I was married 10 years already.
[03:10:40.369 --> 03:10:41.110]  Can you believe that?
[03:10:41.330 --> 03:10:42.270]  I remember.
[03:10:42.310 --> 03:10:43.231]  All your kids were babies.
[03:10:43.431 --> 03:10:44.772]  Now that you've got grandkids.
[03:10:44.992 --> 03:10:45.832]  And you weren't married.
[03:10:45.872 --> 03:10:46.252]  Look at us.
[03:10:46.292 --> 03:10:47.133]  We've both got fat.
[03:10:48.253 --> 03:10:51.475]  You're a good looking guy, too.
[03:10:51.695 --> 03:10:54.257]  Alex, they used to call you the Greek God.
[03:10:54.677 --> 03:10:56.138]  Wait till you see the picture coming up.
[03:10:56.398 --> 03:10:57.859]  Oh, stop about me.
[03:10:58.359 --> 03:10:59.640]  I did not have any problem with the women.
[03:10:59.660 --> 03:11:00.260]  Let's just say that.
[03:11:02.291 --> 03:11:03.631]  Anyways, it's crazy stuff.
[03:11:03.731 --> 03:11:04.191]  All right, Mike.
[03:11:04.612 --> 03:11:05.812]  Listen, I don't want to talk about me.
[03:11:05.832 --> 03:11:12.093]  When you come back, because I've been asking you for years to come here, we're going to do a whole retrospective on all the crazy stuff we did.
[03:11:12.433 --> 03:11:13.073]  That's interesting.
[03:11:13.113 --> 03:11:13.534]  Not me.
[03:11:14.474 --> 03:11:15.234]  We got more photos.
[03:11:15.514 --> 03:11:16.574]  I came here for one reason.
[03:11:16.594 --> 03:11:17.014]  Waco?
[03:11:17.294 --> 03:11:20.275]  To wish you a happy 50th.
[03:11:20.555 --> 03:11:20.755]  I know.
[03:11:20.775 --> 03:11:22.615]  You're making a big deal about this.
[03:11:22.816 --> 03:11:24.096]  I think it's a big deal.
[03:11:24.936 --> 03:11:27.457]  I think you made it to 50 almost.
[03:11:27.477 --> 03:11:28.617]  50 on Sunday.
[03:11:30.940 --> 03:11:31.480]  50 on Sunday.
[03:11:31.500 --> 03:11:32.680]  I heard a thing went out here.
[03:11:32.700 --> 03:11:33.360]  I'm going to blow this up.
[03:11:34.381 --> 03:11:37.961]  I did have a Trump impersonator coming in, but I got in trouble for that.
[03:11:38.281 --> 03:11:40.902]  No, we're not doing it.
[03:11:40.942 --> 03:11:43.262]  Listen, I just heard about... Thank you.
[03:11:43.742 --> 03:11:45.063]  I just heard about George dying.
[03:11:45.483 --> 03:11:46.683]  You're like, remember George?
[03:11:46.743 --> 03:11:47.803]  I'm like, of course I remember George.
[03:11:47.843 --> 03:11:48.463]  George Butler.
[03:11:48.603 --> 03:11:52.344]  It seems like yesterday we should go eat every week at the pancake place.
[03:11:52.824 --> 03:11:53.784]  He's helped us with the show.
[03:11:54.324 --> 03:11:56.385]  And then he's just... He's a really smart guy.
[03:11:56.485 --> 03:11:56.825]  Yeah.
[03:11:57.645 --> 03:11:58.425]  He looked like Einstein.
[03:11:59.672 --> 03:12:02.574]  He was one of your biggest fans, I mean, from the very beginning.
[03:12:02.594 --> 03:12:04.776]  Well, I'm a big fan of you.
[03:12:05.416 --> 03:12:06.937]  But listen, we got to hang out, man.
[03:12:06.977 --> 03:12:08.978]  We always talk on the phone like once a week.
[03:12:08.998 --> 03:12:10.799]  I haven't seen you in like five years.
[03:12:12.400 --> 03:12:15.822]  Alex, I have not been in this studio for 11 years.
[03:12:17.363 --> 03:12:17.744]  I was here 2013.
[03:12:17.884 --> 03:12:20.165]  It's the last time I've been here.
[03:12:20.225 --> 03:12:22.587]  What's crazy is time just goes by fast.
[03:12:22.667 --> 03:12:23.888]  Well, what about 30 years?
[03:12:24.388 --> 03:12:25.529]  It just went by like that.
[03:12:27.152 --> 03:12:30.276]  1995, I saw you sitting at AXS TV.
[03:12:30.597 --> 03:12:32.399]  I said, that guy's going to be a star.
[03:12:32.679 --> 03:12:33.120]  Oh, God.
[03:12:33.140 --> 03:12:35.043]  I knew it right away when I saw you.
[03:12:35.083 --> 03:12:35.563]  Stop it.
[03:12:35.764 --> 03:12:36.885]  Hey, this clip's really funny.
[03:12:37.206 --> 03:12:39.849]  We were practicing going to Bohemian Grove, and now we're going to act like globalists.
[03:12:40.230 --> 03:12:40.830]  Back this up.
[03:12:40.850 --> 03:12:42.152]  You have the audio at the beginning of the scene.
[03:12:42.573 --> 03:12:43.574]  This is hilarious.
[03:12:44.355 --> 03:12:45.736]  This is absolutely hilarious.
[03:12:46.096 --> 03:12:48.317]  Mike, we've got to do this justice.
[03:12:48.617 --> 03:12:49.858]  Forget my 50th birthday.
[03:12:50.898 --> 03:12:52.659]  That's the only reason why I came here.
[03:12:52.719 --> 03:12:53.820]  It's really important to you.
[03:12:53.840 --> 03:12:55.901]  Let me tell you something that's really good.
[03:12:57.362 --> 03:12:58.802]  Something that's really good.
[03:12:59.803 --> 03:13:00.263]  Pause this.
[03:13:00.283 --> 03:13:01.384]  We're going to play it in a minute.
[03:13:01.404 --> 03:13:02.444]  Go ahead.
[03:13:03.585 --> 03:13:04.525]  I have a new website.
[03:13:04.946 --> 03:13:12.910]  MikeHansonArchives.org I have got all the tapes transferred over from the last 30 years now.
[03:13:14.884 --> 03:13:15.985]  Look how fat we both got.
[03:13:16.065 --> 03:13:19.706]  Of course, it goes up on your website first on band.video.
[03:13:19.826 --> 03:13:21.066]  I don't care, put it wherever you want.
[03:13:21.286 --> 03:13:23.166]  Well, no, that's what... You got a channel on there, yeah.
[03:13:23.286 --> 03:13:26.547]  Yeah, so whenever we get a new one, it goes up on there.
[03:13:26.607 --> 03:13:29.508]  And I love it, because I see them, they get on Twitter now, or actually, it blows up.
[03:13:30.108 --> 03:13:31.669]  Because, man, you're just dumping it on there.
[03:13:31.909 --> 03:13:34.429]  Well, we're... Hey, we're going to skip the break.
[03:13:34.490 --> 03:13:41.051]  But go ahead and play this clip from Secret Riddles of the World with John Ronson.
[03:13:41.711 --> 03:13:43.132]  And this is just hilarious.
[03:13:43.152 --> 03:13:43.472]  Here it is.
[03:13:52.454 --> 03:14:03.838]  As fast as microprocessors are starting to move, it's getting down to a molecular level.
[03:14:04.579 --> 03:14:12.022]  The question is at what level will just the actual basics of science stop us from making these systems smaller?
[03:14:13.789 --> 03:14:18.051]  It's the entire nanotechnology revolution that I find to be most dynamic.
[03:14:18.951 --> 03:14:19.492]  I agree.
[03:14:20.992 --> 03:14:21.693]  Do you like that?
[03:14:22.193 --> 03:14:23.613]  That's what we did.
[03:14:23.653 --> 03:14:27.355]  Mike, listen, I'm going to ask you to go to dinner for five years.
[03:14:28.395 --> 03:14:28.796]  That's good.
[03:14:29.216 --> 03:14:30.516]  It's a ridiculous documentary.
[03:14:30.536 --> 03:14:35.098]  It's all over X. Secret Rules of the World with that John Ronson.
[03:14:35.578 --> 03:14:37.859]  Your documentary is good, too, about bohemian growth.
[03:14:37.879 --> 03:14:38.440]  I know, I know.
[03:14:38.500 --> 03:14:39.120]  That's just from that.
[03:14:40.916 --> 03:14:43.679]  Remember how he made us sign a contract that he didn't sneak in with us?
[03:14:44.219 --> 03:14:46.902]  And then like five years later, he goes, they didn't sneak in, I did.
[03:14:46.922 --> 03:14:49.625]  I just think the guy's a piece of crap, man.
[03:14:49.705 --> 03:14:51.066]  I tell you.
[03:14:51.147 --> 03:14:57.914]  Anyways, well, listen, in closing, we're going to end the show and this part of the show with me and the great Jay Dyers can take over.
[03:14:57.934 --> 03:14:59.375]  Let's have a piece of cake together, Mike, okay?
[03:14:59.575 --> 03:14:59.815]  Okay.
[03:15:00.666 --> 03:15:04.687]  And then, send me all the clips, and, oh, you got your new book?
[03:15:04.987 --> 03:15:05.508]  Yeah.
[03:15:05.528 --> 03:15:07.348]  That's not a new book, that's over 20 years old.
[03:15:07.368 --> 03:15:08.048]  That's new now.
[03:15:08.408 --> 03:15:10.969]  But that has a lot of interesting facts about Alex.
[03:15:10.989 --> 03:15:13.090]  This is the best Bohemian Grove book out there.
[03:15:13.950 --> 03:15:18.011]  It is Bohemian Grove, Cult of Conspiracy, Mike Hanson, poured by the great Tex Mars.
[03:15:18.031 --> 03:15:18.452]  Remember him?
[03:15:18.612 --> 03:15:20.152]  Oh, yeah, and he passed away now.
[03:15:22.053 --> 03:15:22.653]  He was awesome.
[03:15:22.733 --> 03:15:23.633]  Is Wanda still alive?
[03:15:24.594 --> 03:15:26.014]  Yeah, they took over the ministry.
[03:15:27.655 --> 03:15:28.755]  They took over the ministry.
[03:15:29.605 --> 03:15:29.785]  Yeah.
[03:15:30.245 --> 03:15:30.526]  All right.
[03:15:30.586 --> 03:15:32.567]  Where do people find Bohemian Grove Cult of Dispersing?
[03:15:33.267 --> 03:15:37.309]  Well, you got to go to MikeHansonArchives.org.
[03:15:37.389 --> 03:15:38.950]  All right, buddy.
[03:15:39.330 --> 03:15:40.331]  We appreciate you.
[03:15:40.911 --> 03:15:41.892]  You got to come see me more.
[03:15:41.932 --> 03:15:43.012]  You only live like an hour away.
[03:15:43.092 --> 03:15:44.493]  And you got to call my secretary.
[03:15:44.513 --> 03:15:45.874]  She'll send it out to you signed.
[03:15:46.794 --> 03:15:47.075]  All right.
[03:15:47.335 --> 03:15:49.716]  So, 30 years, buddy.
[03:15:49.736 --> 03:15:51.817]  30 years.
[03:15:52.918 --> 03:15:54.298]  I remember when you were 21 years old.
[03:15:56.431 --> 03:15:59.813]  I've only been there about six, eight months before I met you.
[03:16:00.614 --> 03:16:05.097]  You were born on the 11th of February, 1974.
[03:16:06.138 --> 03:16:07.819]  That's right.
[03:16:07.979 --> 03:16:08.319]  Yeah.
[03:16:09.080 --> 03:16:10.000]  What's your birthday, Mike?
[03:16:10.240 --> 03:16:10.561]  July 26, 1963.
[03:16:11.521 --> 03:16:15.724]  I was born the year Kennedy got killed.
[03:16:16.024 --> 03:16:19.807]  And your dad was the famous ambulance driver that saved all the folks in the tower shooting.
[03:16:19.927 --> 03:16:23.810]  That was in 1967, the tower shooting happened.
[03:16:24.110 --> 03:16:25.411]  He saved a bunch of people there.
[03:16:26.718 --> 03:16:34.221]  So, and you need, sometime you need to have on the ranger that shot the guy.
[03:16:34.882 --> 03:16:36.662]  He's a real interesting... We've had him on before.
[03:16:36.762 --> 03:16:46.827]  Yeah, but I mean, to reiterate, he said that if it wouldn't have been for all the citizens coming down, keeping the guy at bay, that they wouldn't have been able to... Shooting at him, yeah.
[03:16:46.847 --> 03:16:51.449]  Yeah, all the people in Austin had shotguns in, they came over there and started shooting at the guy.
[03:16:51.969 --> 03:16:52.129]  Yeah.
[03:16:54.022 --> 03:16:54.582]  Absolutely.
[03:16:55.083 --> 03:16:55.503]  All right.
[03:16:55.563 --> 03:17:00.445]  Alex, I had to come down and... Hey, let's have a piece of cake.
[03:17:00.686 --> 03:17:01.646]  Wow, what a day.
[03:17:01.686 --> 03:17:05.748]  The Tucker Carlson interview, Elon Musk on the show, everything else.
[03:17:05.868 --> 03:17:09.350]  It's going to be absolutely amazing.
[03:17:09.370 --> 03:17:16.654]  The War Room is in about 43 minutes, but right now, the great New Orleans researcher, best-selling author, Jay Dyer, takes over.
[03:17:19.306 --> 03:17:19.586]  All right.
[03:17:19.606 --> 03:17:21.687]  Thank you, Alex, for letting me host here.
[03:17:21.727 --> 03:17:22.627]  It's always a pleasure.
[03:17:22.687 --> 03:17:29.149]  I want to talk about the background, the history, kind of the way that in that interview Putin went into a big 13-minute history talk.
[03:17:29.649 --> 03:17:42.353]  I want to kind of give a meta-level big picture of what the issue is with Russia today, what the issue is with the West's goals and their strategies post-Cold War.
[03:17:42.373 --> 03:17:46.014]  I think we're still kind of in a new Cold War setting, you could say.
[03:17:46.954 --> 03:17:55.257]  And what's the orthodox ethos that Putin brought up that the West is so concerned with and feels the need to go after?
[03:17:55.277 --> 03:17:58.158]  I don't agree, by the way, with everything that Putin said in that interview.
[03:17:58.198 --> 03:18:00.619]  I think there were some interesting points that he made.
[03:18:00.659 --> 03:18:01.739]  He made a lot of great points.
[03:18:02.439 --> 03:18:11.903]  There was a few areas, again, where I disagree, but it's really important to know the history of this, and I want to try to boil it down both from a religious perspective and a geopolitical perspective.
[03:18:12.603 --> 03:18:12.723]  So,
[03:18:13.863 --> 03:18:42.411]  You heard in one of the clips Alex talking about the mystery religions, and he was playing some older discussions that people have had about the ancient mystery religions, and I want to talk about how that plays into this as well because secret societies, bloodlines, all of that, believe it or not, does play a role in the reason why Orthodox Christianity is a key enemy of the New World Order, why Russia was targeted, according to Dr. Carol Quigley, 100-plus years ago via the Western banking elite
[03:18:43.467 --> 03:18:47.390]  As well as the subversion that's done through various secret societies.
[03:18:47.430 --> 03:18:51.713]  In fact, I have with me here Albert Pike's Morals and Dogmas.
[03:18:52.373 --> 03:18:53.334]  Morals and Dogmas, excuse me.
[03:18:54.635 --> 03:18:56.276]  I've read a good bit of this book.
[03:18:56.336 --> 03:18:58.358]  It's a gigantic, massive text.
[03:18:58.718 --> 03:19:06.523]  I've also got other irrelevant geopolitical texts that I highly recommend everybody should be aware of, like F. Wayne Mingdahl's book, Full Spectrum Dominance.
[03:19:08.004 --> 03:19:11.587]  But if we want to talk about the religious side of this, if we go back to the ancient
[03:19:12.247 --> 03:19:13.368]  We're good to go.
[03:19:13.388 --> 03:19:13.528]  I think?
[03:19:40.856 --> 03:19:47.458]  The Antichrist deity that I'm talking about would be a kind of person or a kind of leader that would stand against the idea of the God in heaven.
[03:19:47.959 --> 03:19:51.720]  I don't think that they were building the Tower of Babel because they literally thought they could go into heaven.
[03:19:51.740 --> 03:19:54.961]  It was a symbolic defiance of heaven, in my view.
[03:19:55.821 --> 03:20:02.824]  So every empire in the world has had this motivation to want to construct this Babel again.
[03:20:04.625 --> 03:20:05.125]  Why is that?
[03:20:05.165 --> 03:20:08.586]  Why can't world empires just kind of be who they are and do their thing?
[03:20:09.423 --> 03:20:13.746]  Well, partly because of human greed and the desire to rule.
[03:20:15.448 --> 03:20:18.110]  What's the line of Arnold Schwarzenegger?
[03:20:18.490 --> 03:20:21.272]  To hear the lamentation of the women.
[03:20:21.933 --> 03:20:23.794]  That's the desire of fallen mankind.
[03:20:24.395 --> 03:20:31.600]  Yes, but there's also a spirit that impels mankind to engage in these kinds of activities.
[03:20:31.620 --> 03:20:33.041]  And I think that's the devil.
[03:20:33.061 --> 03:20:34.863]  I think that's a fallen spiritual entity.
[03:20:35.518 --> 03:20:45.787]  So the motivation that the devil has is ultimately to gather mankind into a gigantic global anti-Christ religion and rebellion, a one-world religion.
[03:20:48.128 --> 03:20:52.472]  The religion that probably would be used would be some kind of blending of all the world religions.
[03:20:52.672 --> 03:20:58.517]  We have this idea, for example, even in the ancient empires, that the religion is really a function of the state.
[03:20:59.178 --> 03:21:00.679]  As long as you worship the emperor...
[03:21:01.624 --> 03:21:11.809]  You can believe or do whatever you want, religiously speaking, just so long as you acknowledge the emperor or his role as the image of the god figure.
[03:21:13.170 --> 03:21:17.532]  That said, most ancient world imperial religions were controlled.
[03:21:17.992 --> 03:21:26.476]  They were essentially tools of the state, functions of soft power, or maybe even more than soft power, maybe even the guiding ideology of the empire as a whole.
[03:21:28.257 --> 03:21:30.438]  So they had networks of high priests,
[03:21:30.922 --> 03:21:32.984]  Networks of secret societies.
[03:21:33.644 --> 03:21:44.274]  Plato talks about this, for example, in his book The Timaeus, where he talks about Socrates going and learning from Solon, who went and learned from the ancient Egyptian priests, all of the Egyptian mysteries.
[03:21:45.875 --> 03:21:53.842]  Those mysteries are what's contained in the Timaeus, which is a cosmology, a cosmogony, the origin of the universe, the way the universe is structured.
[03:21:54.412 --> 03:21:55.332]  We're good to go.
[03:22:15.925 --> 03:22:17.786]  Concealed, occulted knowledge.
[03:22:17.826 --> 03:22:18.627]  It just means hidden.
[03:22:18.887 --> 03:22:23.870]  It doesn't have to mean something demonic per se, although in many cases it does end up being that.
[03:22:23.890 --> 03:22:25.050]  It just means hidden.
[03:22:25.170 --> 03:22:27.351]  It just means secret.
[03:22:28.892 --> 03:22:34.656]  And so all the states in these imperial structures had secret religions which they controlled.
[03:22:34.696 --> 03:22:38.478]  Plato describes this in the Republic as the Ring of Gyges.
[03:22:38.538 --> 03:22:39.178]  The Ring is this sort of
[03:22:43.635 --> 03:22:46.016]  Symbolic thing for inner hidden power.
[03:22:46.036 --> 03:22:52.938]  He says that there's a noble lie that the state has to erect by which it rules the population through this noble lie.
[03:22:54.099 --> 03:23:00.881]  Because most people can't handle what's actually the case, they need to be given these religious lies to order their lives and to control them.
[03:23:01.781 --> 03:23:09.644]  Versions of that same religious deception, manipulation were used throughout, you know, again, Babylon, Persia,
[03:23:10.703 --> 03:23:15.366]  The Greeks, and then finally the Romans, as you have this structure listed in the biblical prophets.
[03:23:16.507 --> 03:23:33.077]  But we're told, for example, in Daniel 2 and in Daniel 9, that in the days of this final empire, the Roman Empire, a child would be born, a Messiah would come, who would break the reigns, would break the control of the previous world religion systems and establish a new kingdom.
[03:23:33.697 --> 03:23:39.701]  In Daniel, it even says that the time of the Messiah would bring about a kingdom which would eventually envelop
[03:23:40.586 --> 03:23:41.446]  We're good to go.
[03:23:41.466 --> 03:23:41.626]  I think?
[03:24:02.239 --> 03:24:03.640]  That's exactly what we see in the first chapter.
[03:24:31.411 --> 03:24:39.033]  1,000, 2,000 years of Christianity as the Gentile nation is converting and coming into this one holy Catholic apostolic Orthodox church, in my view.
[03:24:40.513 --> 03:24:49.716]  Now, there's schisms and splits in this church later on in history, but the reason this is relevant for what we're talking about today is that there's a dual system, you could say, going on here.
[03:24:50.136 --> 03:24:55.597]  There's a system of the secret society philosophies and beliefs, their hermetic religions,
[03:24:56.104 --> 03:24:59.185]  There are Gnosticism, there are alchemy, all these different sects.
[03:24:59.225 --> 03:25:05.026]  You could go back to the Middle Ages with the Bogomils, the Waldensians, the Cathari in France.
[03:25:05.526 --> 03:25:20.709]  They had these Gnostic secret teachings in various ways, formations, manifestations, but most of the time it was some kind of dualism, some kind of philosophy of an inner secret Gnostic elite and everyone else was profane and didn't understand the deep mysteries.
[03:25:21.889 --> 03:25:24.630]  For example, if you were a part of the normal public
[03:25:25.049 --> 03:25:32.232]  Catholic Church throughout those centuries, the Gnostics, the Cathari, the Bogomils, etc., they thought you were basically worthless.
[03:25:32.252 --> 03:25:37.695]  You didn't have a higher intellectual enlightened supernosis or whatever they possessed.
[03:25:39.115 --> 03:25:47.679]  Now, most of those groups, historically speaking, have died and gone away, but they did transmit various ideas that continued on, even into Byzantium.
[03:25:48.263 --> 03:25:48.843]  We're good to go.
[03:26:11.294 --> 03:26:11.734]  We're good to go.
[03:26:39.716 --> 03:26:40.196]  We're good to go.
[03:27:09.167 --> 03:27:09.627]  I think so.
[03:27:30.330 --> 03:27:34.872]  Many of them were involved in Freemasonic lodges, which was a way for them to network and connect.
[03:27:35.372 --> 03:27:46.337]  At the same time as a lot of that was happening in Russia, the British Empire had its global network of Freemasonic lodges that functioned as its intelligence operation.
[03:27:47.318 --> 03:27:49.799]  I'm not saying that everybody in the Masonic lodges was a spy.
[03:27:49.819 --> 03:27:52.960]  I'm not saying that everybody who was a spy is a Freemason.
[03:27:52.980 --> 03:27:59.123]  But throughout the British Empire, this vast network of lodges throughout the world, which is even mentioned in countless movies,
[03:27:59.990 --> 03:28:01.491]  Go watch Michael Caine.
[03:28:01.912 --> 03:28:04.193]  There's Michael Caine and the man who would be king.
[03:28:04.834 --> 03:28:05.674]  And Sean Connery.
[03:28:05.994 --> 03:28:22.486]  Sean Connery plays a reincarnated Alexander the Great, who, with his conman buddy, Michael Caine, uses Freemasonic mythology to dupe a very third-world tribe, we could say, into believing that he's a messiah.
[03:28:22.546 --> 03:28:27.770]  And the whole movie is basically about Freemasonry and religious mythology being a con and a deception.
[03:28:28.991 --> 03:28:35.573]  That's just one example that I'm giving, but you can see from the movie that they kind of functioned as, you could say, spies, Freemasonic spies, so to speak.
[03:28:35.593 --> 03:28:39.514]  Now, I'm not spending this whole talk on Freemasonry.
[03:28:39.534 --> 03:28:44.655]  I just want to give a few examples of how it relates to where we're getting with the confrontation between East and West.
[03:28:44.695 --> 03:28:46.436]  And it's not ultimately about Freemasonry.
[03:28:46.456 --> 03:28:48.436]  It does play a role, though, in this history.
[03:28:49.096 --> 03:28:52.537]  When we come back, we'll get into more of that and explain the Putin-Tucker interview.
[03:28:52.557 --> 03:28:53.457]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:53.477 --> 03:28:55.218]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:28:56.266 --> 03:28:58.529]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[03:28:58.689 --> 03:28:59.049]  Thank you.
[03:28:59.230 --> 03:29:01.793]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[03:29:01.853 --> 03:29:03.114]  I started taking that stuff.
[03:29:03.154 --> 03:29:06.358]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[03:29:06.478 --> 03:29:07.379]  When did you start taking it?
[03:29:07.660 --> 03:29:11.604]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure, and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[03:29:11.624 --> 03:29:11.845]  Mm-hmm.
[03:29:12.245 --> 03:29:14.947]  And I started eating a little better, but my blood pressure stayed high.
[03:29:14.967 --> 03:29:22.492]  And when I took X2 iodine after about two or four weeks, I think my body detoxified of a bunch of metals and stuff that my body was storing.
[03:29:22.612 --> 03:29:24.814]  And my blood pressure came down to the perfect level.
[03:29:25.194 --> 03:29:28.136]  And I tell people the only thing I did was X2 iodine.
[03:29:28.596 --> 03:29:42.490]  And even though I do think all your other products are good, I recommend to anybody that they start with X2 iodine because it detoxifies your body and kind of kicks your natural DNA into full force.
[03:29:42.550 --> 03:29:46.053]  So in my life, I found X2 iodine the best.
[03:29:46.494 --> 03:29:49.937]  I tried other iodines and they didn't have the same effect.
[03:29:50.257 --> 03:29:52.539]  So X2 iodine, I really wanted to point that out.
[03:29:57.096 --> 03:29:57.777]  We're good to go.
[03:29:57.797 --> 03:29:58.037]  I think?
[03:30:20.513 --> 03:30:21.334]  We're good to go.
[03:30:39.770 --> 03:30:41.772]  If you ever take one piece of my advice...
[03:31:00.934 --> 03:31:02.135]  It's get a bottle of X2.
[03:31:02.896 --> 03:31:07.179]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[03:31:07.579 --> 03:31:12.042]  We finally have a limited run back in supply at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:31:13.403 --> 03:31:16.165]  So many people have serious issues.
[03:31:16.445 --> 03:31:17.566]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[03:31:18.026 --> 03:31:23.430]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[03:31:23.971 --> 03:31:26.352]  Most of their iodine is bound to other heavy metals or...
[03:31:27.233 --> 03:31:29.393]  Bound to other elements, so you don't download it.
[03:31:29.994 --> 03:31:34.934]  But this is pure atomic certified iodine.
[03:31:35.574 --> 03:31:38.655]  X2 is now back in stock, discounted.
[03:31:38.995 --> 03:31:42.176]  So I'm giving Thanksgiving right now for this product being here.
[03:31:42.516 --> 03:31:47.617]  It funds the InfoWar, but I guarantee you, you take this for a few weeks, you will feel the difference.
[03:31:47.777 --> 03:31:48.577]  It is amazing.
[03:31:48.897 --> 03:31:50.537]  It's the missing link, X2.
[03:31:51.017 --> 03:31:52.957]  Back in stock at the end of 2023 at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:31:53.358 --> 03:31:53.378]  X2.
[03:31:57.967 --> 03:31:59.208]  Gunther in Tennessee.
[03:31:59.248 --> 03:32:00.249]  Thanks for calling, Gunther.
[03:32:21.186 --> 03:32:29.432]  Well, I'm glad you mentioned that because it's methylfolate, the breakdown of folic acid, and a lot of people, particularly Europeans, don't absorb all of the folic acid.
[03:32:29.672 --> 03:32:30.753]  So it's not a stimulant.
[03:32:30.973 --> 03:32:34.395]  It's a totally natural thing that boosts energy that's foundational.
[03:32:34.695 --> 03:32:37.237]  And was I lying to you or did it not work?
[03:32:37.937 --> 03:32:39.118]  No, it was top-notch.
[03:32:39.178 --> 03:32:42.801]  And I was actually taking Red Pill Plus before, and that's got a little folic acid in it.
[03:32:42.861 --> 03:32:46.643]  I think there was a little buildup from this, but the energy from this was no jitters.
[03:32:46.824 --> 03:32:47.764]  I mean, it's top-notch.
[03:32:47.844 --> 03:32:48.565]  It's a great product.
[03:32:48.971 --> 03:32:49.932]  Well, thank you so much.
[03:32:49.972 --> 03:32:50.293]  Yeah, no.
[03:32:50.393 --> 03:32:53.737]  Folic acid's great and it's in real red pill, but some can't break it down.
[03:32:53.777 --> 03:32:54.758]  This is the breakdown of it.
[03:32:54.858 --> 03:32:55.639]  That's exactly it.
[03:32:58.723 --> 03:33:04.631]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:13.248 --> 03:33:15.330]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.350 --> 03:33:17.212]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:33:17.252 --> 03:33:29.041]  We're talking about the big meta-level history breakdown, similar to what Putin did in the interview with Tucker, giving the meta perspective, big God's eye perspective, as best we can.
[03:33:29.662 --> 03:33:36.768]  And we're talking about this hermetic lineage as contrasted to the Christian teaching, the theology of the church as it
[03:33:37.449 --> 03:33:37.769]  We're good to go.
[03:34:03.416 --> 03:34:07.137]  Functioned as Jessica Harlan Jacobs as a historian.
[03:34:07.737 --> 03:34:09.078]  She's not a conspiracy theorist.
[03:34:09.098 --> 03:34:10.438]  This is just mainline history.
[03:34:10.918 --> 03:34:15.160]  She talks about how these were essentially the intelligence networks of the British Empire.
[03:34:16.100 --> 03:34:26.263]  Part and parcel with intelligence networks comes the cultists, the secrets that are trafficked, including religious ideas, religious secrets, gnosis, and so forth.
[03:34:27.603 --> 03:34:33.248]  And I mentioned Byzantium in terms of more Cambridge academic scholarship.
[03:34:33.268 --> 03:34:34.789]  There's a recent book that came out.
[03:34:34.809 --> 03:34:41.855]  It's a very technical, very difficult book called Radical Platonism in Byzantium by Niketas Sinisioglou.
[03:34:43.176 --> 03:34:56.367]  The reason this book is relevant is because the whole thesis of the book is that even though the Byzantine Empire had within it the struggle between Neoplatonism and Christianity, Orthodox Christianity, and it tried to suppress the Neoplatonic atheistic
[03:34:58.024 --> 03:34:58.724]  Neoplatonism.
[03:34:59.024 --> 03:35:00.065]  Atheistic Platonism.
[03:35:01.505 --> 03:35:06.828]  This lineage, this ideological tradition survived through the character of Plethon.
[03:35:06.888 --> 03:35:11.370]  Plethon was a Byzantine scholar, academic, and an atheistic Platonist.
[03:35:11.670 --> 03:35:26.256]  His atheistic Platonism, according to Sinisioglu, is what was handed over to the Spinoza circles, and then by extension, eventually, as it found its way into the Jacobin Luminist circles.
[03:35:26.980 --> 03:35:46.811]  So this is yet another historical adaptation to the fact that the secret society mysteries, the myths, the symbols, the codes, the hidden keys and all of this, is really just a mechanism by which people are duped and people can be controlled by more cunning people in typically this state, especially throughout this period.
[03:35:47.991 --> 03:35:48.952]  And I think that stays true.
[03:35:50.054 --> 03:35:51.575]  The norm all the way up until today.
[03:35:51.595 --> 03:35:54.477]  I mean, although today it's more of a corporate state.
[03:35:54.517 --> 03:36:00.000]  It's not really the empire or some king that's controlling us and duping us.
[03:36:00.060 --> 03:36:04.243]  It's more so CEOs and Bilderberg and Davos.
[03:36:04.283 --> 03:36:06.084]  These are the people who are the new kings of our day.
[03:36:06.644 --> 03:36:09.686]  But they're utilizing a lot of these same tricks, tactics, and techniques.
[03:36:10.707 --> 03:36:18.451]  And in regard to the mysteries and the secret society techniques that are used, these become ways by which...
[03:36:20.123 --> 03:36:22.005]  Intelligence agents can provocateur.
[03:36:22.045 --> 03:36:29.412]  And that's essentially what we see the Masonic Lodges in Russia and throughout Europe doing during these revolutionary periods.
[03:36:29.712 --> 03:36:40.483]  And we've talked a lot about that famous history text, The Fire in the Minds of Men, which talks about how the Lodges took this hermetic ideology and heritage of
[03:36:41.169 --> 03:36:52.375]  Revolution of pure flux and chaos and even atheistic Platonism to its full conclusions by initiating the Bolshevik Revolution.
[03:36:53.476 --> 03:36:55.857]  And again, this is not conspiracy theory.
[03:36:55.897 --> 03:37:00.580]  This is well documented now in a lot of academic philosophical texts.
[03:37:00.880 --> 03:37:06.223]  Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition, Hegelianism, which is central to the history of
[03:37:07.219 --> 03:37:07.779]  Marxism.
[03:37:07.919 --> 03:37:16.242]  You couldn't have Marxism without Hegel because Marx turns Hegel on his head and uses that dialectical chaos philosophy to produce the synthesis.
[03:37:16.522 --> 03:37:28.206]  And that's ultimately the philosophy of the revolutionaries, the Trotskys, the Lenins, these characters, is that constant perpetual chaos is what produces the synthesis where they want to take things.
[03:37:28.786 --> 03:37:32.268]  And again, this even comes up in books like Albert Pike's Morals and Dogma.
[03:37:32.288 --> 03:37:35.829]  There's a whole chapter on what he says true Christianity is.
[03:37:36.601 --> 03:37:47.188]  And it's the Prince of Mercy or the Scottish Trinitarian where he explains that for the Freemason at that level, God is an eternal world emanator.
[03:37:47.449 --> 03:37:52.192]  He's just repeating the Neoplatonic philosophy of Plethon and the Hermeticists.
[03:37:53.053 --> 03:37:57.796]  And this is exactly, by the way, what the British Empire adopted as its Hermetic philosophy.
[03:37:57.816 --> 03:37:59.277]  There's books that have come out recently.
[03:37:59.980 --> 03:38:03.523]  There have been a lot of corrupt leaders and a lot of things going on that were bad.
[03:38:29.291 --> 03:38:31.152]  You know, people like Peter the Great.
[03:38:31.733 --> 03:38:33.433]  I think he was not that great of a leader.
[03:38:33.453 --> 03:38:34.254]  I think he was corrupt.
[03:38:34.294 --> 03:38:43.219]  But regardless, there is this desire to establish the revolutionary faith throughout the world.
[03:38:43.539 --> 03:38:47.941]  And that's why in the Billington book it's called the revolutionary faith.
[03:38:48.282 --> 03:38:54.265]  The revolutionary faith is the same faith that's mentioned by Aldous Huxley in his book Brave New World.
[03:38:54.835 --> 03:38:56.996]  The final revolution is the revolution against man.
[03:38:57.056 --> 03:39:00.078]  So anything that stands in the way has to be gotten rid of.
[03:39:00.498 --> 03:39:13.446]  Quigley explains this in the first few hundred pages where he says that the two chief enemies of the Western Anglo-American pragmatic empire doesn't have anything to do with British people, per se.
[03:39:13.466 --> 03:39:14.707]  It's not talking about the people.
[03:39:14.767 --> 03:39:18.870]  It's talking about the geopolitical structure of the Atlantis, this power block.
[03:39:19.170 --> 03:39:20.390]  And that's not about Atlantis.
[03:39:21.111 --> 03:39:23.392]  We're not talking about sunken islands.
[03:39:23.412 --> 03:39:24.433]  We're talking about the
[03:39:24.878 --> 03:39:26.799]  This area geopolitically.
[03:39:29.039 --> 03:39:30.240]  The West versus the East.
[03:39:31.200 --> 03:39:39.583]  And that's why Brzezinski, people like Kissinger, have talked about how in order to control the world, you control the Eurasian heartland.
[03:39:40.543 --> 03:39:42.043]  That's the key to controlling the world.
[03:39:42.123 --> 03:39:44.484]  That is the Alfred Mackinder thesis, right?
[03:39:44.504 --> 03:39:46.105]  The geo-pivot thesis.
[03:39:48.092 --> 03:39:51.374]  Geopolitical pivot of history is controlling the Eurasian heartland.
[03:39:51.734 --> 03:39:54.035]  That's the old British imperial structure and model.
[03:39:54.475 --> 03:39:55.636]  So, what does that mean?
[03:39:55.956 --> 03:40:04.099]  That means areas like Ukraine, areas like the borders of Russia are crucial to control for having global hegemony.
[03:40:05.800 --> 03:40:08.882]  And the philosophies and the worldviews play a key role in this.
[03:40:09.022 --> 03:40:10.562]  It's called Weltanschauungskrieg.
[03:40:11.103 --> 03:40:12.123]  Worldview warfare.
[03:40:12.943 --> 03:40:16.145]  Will we have a worldview based on Western...
[03:40:16.846 --> 03:40:24.151]  Empiricist pragmatic ideas, or what Putin talked about when he was talking to Tucker, eternal ideas.
[03:40:25.391 --> 03:40:26.832]  He brought up Dostoevsky.
[03:40:27.092 --> 03:40:30.434]  He brought up the idea of eternal truths.
[03:40:31.155 --> 03:40:34.537]  In fact, one of his influences is Ivan Ilyin.
[03:40:34.617 --> 03:40:45.904]  He's a Russian thinker and philosopher who's not very well known in the West, but if you read some of his essays that are translated by one of my friends, Mark Hackard, over at Espionage History Archive,
[03:40:46.840 --> 03:40:48.442]  Or Soul of the East.
[03:40:48.462 --> 03:40:49.703]  I don't know if Soul of the East still exists.
[03:40:49.723 --> 03:40:52.385]  But Mark has translated a lot of his essays and works.
[03:40:52.465 --> 03:40:57.629]  And Ivan Ilyin is a very Dostoevsky-influenced thinker.
[03:40:59.030 --> 03:41:02.974]  He's also written on how there's a lot of platonic influences in Dostoevsky.
[03:41:03.474 --> 03:41:06.637]  And so I know I was critiquing atheistic Platonism earlier.
[03:41:06.657 --> 03:41:08.178]  There's different versions of this.
[03:41:08.238 --> 03:41:09.599]  I'm not trying to equate these things.
[03:41:09.699 --> 03:41:12.822]  But Putin was definitely expressing the idea that
[03:41:13.832 --> 03:41:25.195]  Versus the Western idea of everything being in flux, which is essentially the revolutionary philosophy going back to the pre-Socratics, which is restated by people like Lenin and Trotsky.
[03:41:27.135 --> 03:41:31.896]  You have the idea that he outlines, which is that there are objective eternal truths.
[03:41:31.936 --> 03:41:32.776]  There's natures.
[03:41:33.656 --> 03:41:34.597]  People have natures.
[03:41:34.637 --> 03:41:37.457]  You can't turn people's natures into some other nature.
[03:41:37.717 --> 03:41:40.398]  You can't turn a woman into a man, a man into a woman.
[03:41:41.092 --> 03:41:44.094]  There are families, and families are like many nations, right?
[03:41:44.114 --> 03:41:49.676]  And so there's a connection between the family as a people group and the nation as a larger extension of that people group.
[03:41:49.696 --> 03:41:52.918]  And that's just the way all human beings have thought for thousands of years.
[03:41:53.458 --> 03:42:07.866]  But the revolutionary philosophy at its very core that we're talking about, which was it's not identical to all of the lodges, and I'm saying everybody is a Freemason, but I'm saying that the philosophy in the revolutionary lodges was used to bring about the revolutions to where we are now,
[03:42:08.929 --> 03:42:13.451]  And the last two remaining empires Quigley talks about, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Russian Empire.
[03:42:14.052 --> 03:42:22.175]  He says those two things need to go away for the hope of the tragedy and hope to come about.
[03:42:22.235 --> 03:42:23.696]  What's the hope of the book Tragedy and Hope?
[03:42:24.376 --> 03:42:26.177]  Western democratic capitalism.
[03:42:27.558 --> 03:42:28.858]  Now, you might think, well, what's wrong with that?
[03:42:28.878 --> 03:42:29.639]  That sounds like a good thing.
[03:42:29.679 --> 03:42:30.599]  No, it's not what you think.
[03:42:31.019 --> 03:42:34.041]  It means technocratic corporate control.
[03:42:34.676 --> 03:42:49.565]  When you read Tragedy and Hope, the middle chapter is one of the most important chapters because it's the chapter where he says that the world I'm talking about will be an AI-run, technocratic, smart city, you know, fake nightmare dystopia.
[03:42:50.025 --> 03:42:50.886]  He thinks it's a good thing.
[03:42:51.566 --> 03:42:52.506]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:52.526 --> 03:42:52.927]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:52.947 --> 03:42:54.628]  Your guest host is Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:42:56.786 --> 03:42:58.628]  But folks, we're standing up for our rights.
[03:42:58.648 --> 03:42:59.730]  We're standing up for your rights.
[03:42:59.770 --> 03:43:02.153]  We're standing up for all of our freedoms and our children.
[03:43:02.373 --> 03:43:10.023]  If you don't spread the word about the broadcast, if you don't share the links, if you don't buy products at InfoWarsStore.com, then I'm not griping at you.
[03:43:10.043 --> 03:43:11.144]  I'm just saying, what are you doing?
[03:43:12.245 --> 03:43:15.509]  Less than 1% of you ever buy a product at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:43:16.423 --> 03:43:23.407]  If just half a percent more would go buy a book or a film or a t-shirt or get some of our great supplements and then reorder them because they really work.
[03:43:23.727 --> 03:43:24.307]  Just try it.
[03:43:24.927 --> 03:43:26.868]  We would be able to do so many things.
[03:43:27.228 --> 03:43:30.990]  I'm praying to God that he'll touch your heart to decide to support us.
[03:43:31.531 --> 03:43:32.971]  Infowarsstore.com
[03:43:35.452 --> 03:43:36.092]  It's been sold out.
[03:43:36.132 --> 03:43:36.913]  It's back in stock.
[03:43:36.973 --> 03:43:38.174]  Reformulated even stronger.
[03:43:38.974 --> 03:43:40.836]  Nitric boost to clean out your blood and your whole body.
[03:43:41.296 --> 03:43:42.377]  Vasodilation.
[03:43:42.397 --> 03:43:44.758]  It's got a lot of wonderful side effects.
[03:43:44.798 --> 03:43:45.419]  And I mean good ones.
[03:43:45.439 --> 03:43:46.640]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[03:43:47.260 --> 03:43:48.161]  It is powerful.
[03:43:48.201 --> 03:43:49.121]  So be careful with it.

[03:44:56.576 --> 03:44:59.137]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalist.
[03:44:59.497 --> 03:45:01.857]  And people can't identify who's a patriot and who isn't.
[03:45:02.177 --> 03:45:05.318]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalist.
[03:45:05.378 --> 03:45:08.279]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.
[03:45:08.539 --> 03:45:19.101]  That's why I designed this amazing 1776 red, white, and blue Gadsden flag shirt so you can support the Infowar and meet like-minded people everywhere when you wear it.

[03:46:03.058 --> 03:46:07.340]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[03:46:07.720 --> 03:46:12.102]  We finally have a limited run back in supply at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:46:13.543 --> 03:46:16.325]  So many people have serious issues.
[03:46:16.585 --> 03:46:17.726]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[03:46:18.166 --> 03:46:23.570]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[03:46:24.110 --> 03:46:29.513]  Most of their iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[03:46:30.134 --> 03:46:33.056]  But this is pure atomic certified iodine.
[03:46:35.727 --> 03:46:38.808]  X2 is now back in stock, discounted.
[03:46:39.149 --> 03:46:42.310]  So I'm giving Thanksgiving right now for this product being here.
[03:46:42.670 --> 03:46:47.771]  It funds the InfoWar, but I guarantee you, you take this for a few weeks, you will feel the difference.
[03:46:47.931 --> 03:46:48.732]  It is amazing.
[03:46:49.052 --> 03:46:55.054]  It's the missing link, X2, back in stock at the end of 2023 at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:46:55.474 --> 03:46:55.874]  X2.
[03:46:58.195 --> 03:47:04.097]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:13.669 --> 03:47:14.750]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:14.770 --> 03:47:16.491]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:47:16.731 --> 03:47:22.836]  Breaking down the real spiritual battle that has manifested East and West.
[03:47:22.956 --> 03:47:27.679]  That's one of the areas that I disagree with Putin and the discussion that he had with Tucker.
[03:47:28.219 --> 03:47:30.881]  But we can actually see this playing out ideologically.
[03:47:30.941 --> 03:47:32.703]  And I talked about worldview warfare.
[03:47:32.763 --> 03:47:38.847]  Quigley says that the two main enemies to the Atlantis Empire of the West had to be destroyed.
[03:47:38.887 --> 03:47:41.669]  That would be the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Russian Empire.
[03:47:42.202 --> 03:47:56.572]  The first two world wars of the last century, Quigley says, had the effect of successfully dissipating and exhausting the Austro-Hungarian Empire and destroying that potential threat out of Europe.
[03:47:57.092 --> 03:48:08.020]  Then he says that the next threat would be Russia and the Russian Empire, and the exportation of Bolshevism, communism, Sovietism also, I think, in the long run had the effect of
[03:48:08.558 --> 03:48:09.379]  We're good to go.
[03:48:36.952 --> 03:48:37.993]  American dominance.
[03:48:38.193 --> 03:48:44.959]  That's before, however, they wanted, I think, to shift over into decline, intentional decline.
[03:48:45.099 --> 03:48:57.249]  I think the global elite, even in the West, have made the decision that it's time now to bring America down and to make globalist institutions have the power that America has had
[03:48:57.762 --> 03:48:59.283]  I think that's what he was referring to.
[03:48:59.303 --> 03:49:06.306]  But he also talked about a lot of operations that we over here at Infowars, myself, many of us have talked about in the last 10, 15 years.
[03:49:25.399 --> 03:49:26.339]  We're good to go.
[03:49:49.682 --> 03:49:50.543]  Who stands to gain?
[03:49:50.963 --> 03:49:51.704]  Kibono, right?
[03:49:51.824 --> 03:49:53.225]  And Putin also brought that up.
[03:49:53.245 --> 03:50:09.258]  So basically, every one of the pieces of data that came forward in that interview is identical to all of the analysis and the predictions that Alex, myself, and others have given in the last 10 years about East versus West relations.
[03:50:09.298 --> 03:50:14.242]  In fact, I did a whole three-hour lecture on my YouTube channel about eight months ago
[03:50:14.793 --> 03:50:15.353]  We're good to go.
[03:50:40.737 --> 03:50:41.317]  We're good to go.
[03:51:04.389 --> 03:51:04.629]  I think?
[03:51:23.462 --> 03:51:27.264]  Take over in Europe and perhaps even in America in the near future.
[03:51:27.644 --> 03:51:33.326]  Because human beings cannot subsist and will not last very long in a completely secular atheist society.
[03:51:33.747 --> 03:51:42.911]  They will bend to whatever is the dominant masculine force, and Islam, although I think it's a horrible false religion, has that impetus still within it.
[03:51:43.411 --> 03:51:45.952]  So it will take over Europe, and that's by design.
[03:51:46.072 --> 03:51:49.213]  The Fabian Socialists talked about in the 1910s, 20s, and 30s bringing in
[03:51:52.665 --> 03:51:58.687]  First to London and then to the UK and then into Europe because they thought it could be a force for socialism.
[03:51:59.527 --> 03:52:04.729]  They were too full of hubris, I think, to realize that, no, no, you're not going to control this religion.
[03:52:04.749 --> 03:52:05.969]  This religion will take over.
[03:52:06.510 --> 03:52:13.192]  You might get a few generations of degenerate children of Muslims, but eventually Islam will take over Europe.
[03:52:13.252 --> 03:52:14.132]  And that's by design.
[03:52:15.032 --> 03:52:16.653]  And it's not because the global elite are Muslims.
[03:52:16.673 --> 03:52:17.333]  They're not Muslims.
[03:52:17.893 --> 03:52:18.653]  It's a chess piece.
[03:52:19.314 --> 03:52:20.694]  It's an ideological chess piece.
[03:52:21.192 --> 03:52:23.073]  So chess pieces are not just nation states.
[03:52:23.534 --> 03:52:26.396]  It's not just this nation, Ukraine, and let's use them against it.
[03:52:26.416 --> 03:52:28.217]  It's ideology and religion as well.
[03:52:29.739 --> 03:52:34.602]  And that came up in the debate, or excuse me, in the interview with Putin as well, between Tucker and Putin.
[03:52:34.882 --> 03:52:49.974]  But I'm saying all this because you understand that from the vantage point of the Western evil geopolitical elite, Russia has to be destroyed and taken down because even though that was a big part of the Cold War,
[03:52:51.089 --> 03:52:53.731]  Containing it, bringing it down, looting it.
[03:52:55.752 --> 03:53:00.395]  The Russian people and the Russian soul that Putin talked about are very tough.
[03:53:00.816 --> 03:53:01.676]  They're very resilient.
[03:53:02.537 --> 03:53:03.898]  And they're very hard to bring down.
[03:53:04.678 --> 03:53:13.864]  That's why so many of these Western neoliberal toxic culture operations have to be exported, as well as potentially all the bioweapons labs.
[03:53:13.904 --> 03:53:16.806]  By the way, that was actually reported on years ago.
[03:53:17.127 --> 03:53:17.607]  Dilyana...
[03:53:18.901 --> 03:53:20.662]  Galatseva, I think is her name.
[03:53:21.062 --> 03:53:23.464]  I was at a lecture event with her.
[03:53:24.005 --> 03:53:34.273]  She gave a presentation in 2017 or so on the Pentagon biolabs all over Ukraine and Eastern Europe and other places.
[03:53:34.734 --> 03:53:36.135]  So this has been known for a long time.
[03:53:36.155 --> 03:53:41.319]  And the provocations then were intentional, putting the biolabs there,
[03:53:42.568 --> 03:53:48.550]  The seven years of warfare via NATO against Russia that has sparked this conflict.
[03:53:49.150 --> 03:53:52.871]  The 2014 coup operation, again, done by the West.
[03:53:52.951 --> 03:53:57.852]  All the color revolutions that were funded by Soros entities, CIA stuff.
[03:53:57.892 --> 03:54:00.192]  That was all in the interview.
[03:54:01.453 --> 03:54:10.315]  They didn't mention everybody by name like Soros, but when he's talking about the CIA operations to do these things in Ukraine, the Orange Revolution, that was all Soros and CIA back in
[03:54:10.933 --> 03:54:11.533]  We're good to go.
[03:54:38.792 --> 03:54:39.712]  Of culture war.
[03:54:39.873 --> 03:54:41.033]  Soft power, you see.
[03:54:41.593 --> 03:54:43.514]  And even cutouts for black ops at times.
[03:54:45.375 --> 03:54:50.677]  Same operations in Syria back in 2012, 13, 14 against Assad.
[03:54:50.917 --> 03:54:52.778]  Same operations and strategy against Putin.
[03:54:53.278 --> 03:54:59.881]  Same operations of sniper attacks to try to set off crowd riots, to try to have a coup.
[03:54:59.961 --> 03:55:01.481]  And all of that was mentioned.
[03:55:01.641 --> 03:55:05.303]  Now, not Assad, but coups against Russia, coups against Putin.
[03:55:05.323 --> 03:55:06.603]  That was all brought up in the interview.
[03:55:06.643 --> 03:55:08.384]  So, again, everything that we've talked about,
[03:55:09.071 --> 03:55:24.924]  And again, this key spiritual component is there to split the church in the Ukraine by creating a fake CIA State Department church run by people who aren't even real clerics, people who were defrocked from other churches.
[03:55:26.065 --> 03:55:31.049]  That's the actual history of what's going on in the Ukraine, and it's fostered and funded by Western NGOs,
[03:55:33.240 --> 03:55:34.000]  We're good to go.
[03:55:34.080 --> 03:55:34.321]  I think?
[03:56:02.850 --> 03:56:12.792]  And that's why Francis and all these churches, the Pope Francis Catholic Church, that's why they walk in lockstep now with Davos, Klaus, and the World Economic Forum.
[03:56:12.992 --> 03:56:14.512]  Because they're all part of the same power.
[03:56:14.532 --> 03:56:16.292]  That's the Atlantis' power structure.
[03:56:16.512 --> 03:56:17.553]  It's all these entities.
[03:56:18.633 --> 03:56:25.794]  And they're concerned with Russia as a potential rising threat, as well as perhaps China as well.
[03:56:25.854 --> 03:56:28.935]  And that doesn't make those people angels and good guys.
[03:56:28.995 --> 03:56:30.915]  It just is the reality of geopolitics.
[03:56:32.110 --> 03:56:39.102]  But there is this spiritual component there, which is the battle of evil versus good.
[03:56:39.924 --> 03:56:42.789]  So although people in the state, people who
[03:56:44.219 --> 03:56:50.861]  Are leaders, presidents, kings, whatever, they may view all of this as pure pragmatic politics.
[03:56:50.921 --> 03:56:56.082]  Like if you read the book Dune, right, a lot of the people in Dune, they view it as just pragmatic politics.
[03:56:56.122 --> 03:57:02.083]  But there's actual prophecies, right, about the true leader and the Savior and all that, the Messiah.
[03:57:02.983 --> 03:57:10.165]  And likewise, in terms of Christianity, we have a Messiah and we have a providential spiritual meaning of history.
[03:57:10.956 --> 03:57:14.847]  And that providential spiritual meaning of history involves the church as a key player.
[03:57:15.569 --> 03:57:18.859]  And of course we know that Satan has the desire to destroy the church.
[03:57:19.557 --> 03:57:21.318]  That's a key element I want to highlight.
[03:57:21.738 --> 03:57:32.381]  So if you're watching this, remember, head over to my X, and you'll see at the top there I'm doing a new live event with our good buddy comedian Jamie Kennedy from the movie Scream.
