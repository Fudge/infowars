[00:00:01.553 --> 00:00:06.765]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:07.046 --> 00:00:12.045]  Visit Infowars.com/show and share the link today.
[00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:19.045]   Coming to you live from the Infowars in Battle Studios in Central Texas.
[00:00:19.045 --> 00:00:24.045]  It's June 27th on this live Thursday night transmission.
[00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:28.045]  7.05 Central Standard Time.
[00:00:28.634 --> 00:00:36.033]   And coming up in 55 minutes, we're going to be simulcasting this CNN rigged debate with
[00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:40.914]   all the manipulations and things they've got admittedly baked into this.
[00:00:40.914 --> 00:00:44.514]   Trump is walking into a trap, but President Trump knows that.
[00:00:44.514 --> 00:00:51.033]   And I just can't believe that the crip keeper, Joe Biden, the Chinese communist spy, the
[00:00:51.033 --> 00:00:57.073]   Russian spy, the Ukrainian spy, the father of the crackhead, the guy that his daughter
[00:00:57.073 --> 00:01:02.954]   said molested her in the shower, that he's got the nerve to get up there on stage.
[00:01:03.423 --> 00:01:08.386]  Now they're going to have him lit up like a Christmas tree on methamphetamine and a lot more.
[00:01:09.908 --> 00:01:11.329]  This is going to be historical.
[00:01:12.478 --> 00:01:14.359]  I want to thank you all for joining us tonight.
[00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:38.119]   CNN three days ago sent out letters to X and everybody else and said you're not allowed to cover this or carry this or show clips of this but under fair use under the law political events especially presidential ones are totally protected as long as you're giving commentary and analysis and that's the same thing that Elon Musk said, he said, you can pound sand.
[00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.999]  We're going to air it.
[00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:46.621]  It's going to be on X. Well, we're going to be here simulcasting it tonight, and then we'll have commentary after it as well.
[00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:54.303]  We'll also be simulcasting on X spaces and taking comments from speakers before and after.
[00:01:54.323 --> 00:02:02.265]  We'll also have commentary and analysis from constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes, former top Trump advisor and current confidant.
[00:02:03.945 --> 00:02:12.463]  Roger Stone, we're gonna have the great Owen Schroyer and the amazing Harrison Smith also chiming in from the studio right next door to us all tonight.
[00:02:12.504 --> 00:02:13.325]  I'm gonna try to limit...
[00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.281]  The comments and things during this debate, but I'm going to give some analysis so it's covered by fair use.
[00:02:20.841 --> 00:02:25.122]  If you want a clean feed of it, tune in to CNN, you'll get that there.
[00:02:25.162 --> 00:02:26.623]  But we're going to be giving commentary.
[00:02:26.963 --> 00:02:28.583]  I'll be pointing out obvious scams.
[00:02:29.023 --> 00:02:32.145]  They've got mute buttons they're going to be using predominantly obviously on Trump.
[00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:36.946]  They're going to try to cut him off and have him talking with the sound turned off to make him look like a fool.
[00:02:37.906 --> 00:02:39.227]  That'll be a big takeaway they're going to push.
[00:02:40.607 --> 00:02:44.248]  Also, Trump has a gag order on him still from the New York conviction.
[00:02:44.808 --> 00:02:51.450]  So watch Biden bring up the trial and then hoping that Trump violates the gag order so they can throw him in jail that way.
[00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:01.952]  Robert Barnes, who is accurate about 95% of the time, predicts that there is a very good chance that tonight Trump will announce his VP to steal the show.
[00:03:02.613 --> 00:03:11.683]   But as long as they can't piss Trump off, as long as they can't get him off balance, as long as he just fires the truth, Biden and how he's raped this country and how he told the
[00:03:11.683 --> 00:03:14.822]   illegals when he quotes when the election immediately surged the border and
[00:03:14.822 --> 00:03:17.952]   as long as Trump is in all the dead people and the record crime wave from
[00:03:17.952 --> 00:03:22.913]   the illegal aliens if Trump uses terms like illegal alien he will absolutely
[00:03:22.913 --> 00:03:27.273]   crush Biden. Trump's already way ahead of Biden. The reason they have accepted
[00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:31.803]   this debate but still put a lot of guardrails for themselves in try to rig it
[00:03:31.803 --> 00:03:36.083]   kind of like loading a you know brass knuckles in your boxing glove is because
[00:03:36.083 --> 00:03:42.373]   Biden is so behind they're hoping he can grab victory from the jaws of defeat
[00:03:42.373 --> 00:03:44.602]  tonight.
[00:03:43.482 --> 00:03:45.244]  I do intend to go to some spaces now.
[00:03:46.024 --> 00:03:49.248]  Obviously, we're not going to go to any during the debate other than a few breaks they're going to take.
[00:03:49.848 --> 00:03:51.971]  We'll go right to Spacer's comments during that.
[00:03:52.051 --> 00:03:53.773]  Roger Stone's coming up in a few minutes, popping in.
[00:03:53.993 --> 00:03:55.334]  He'll be on afterwards with us as well.
[00:03:55.655 --> 00:03:56.335]  So has Robert Barnes.
[00:03:56.355 --> 00:03:57.777]  But Chase, you've been in here doing a great job.
[00:03:57.797 --> 00:03:59.739]  I was watching the last hour of live coverage.
[00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:02.762]  The team's done an amazing job throughout the day with the War Room and the other shows.
[00:04:02.782 --> 00:04:04.184]  Appreciate everybody working so hard.
[00:04:04.204 --> 00:04:05.465]  A lot of the crew's been here since 6 a.m.
[00:04:06.686 --> 00:04:10.348]  This morning, we're very thankful to the InfoWars crew and everything they're doing.

[00:04:45.384 --> 00:04:48.948]  Not just the studio and the crew and the reporters and all of it, but the lawfare attacking us.
[00:04:49.269 --> 00:04:52.552]  But we're still hanging in and going down swinging.
[00:04:53.473 --> 00:04:56.517]  God's on our sides, and who knows what's going to happen here in the next few weeks and months.
[00:04:56.817 --> 00:04:57.898]  So certainly pray for us.
[00:04:58.239 --> 00:05:01.122]  And don't forget our other great sponsor, drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:05:01.563 --> 00:05:02.604]  That's my dad's company.
[00:05:02.644 --> 00:05:04.206]  He developed most of the supplements we sell.
[00:05:04.246 --> 00:05:04.706]  He's a doctor.
[00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:18.784]  You can find a lot of the supplements that are available at InfoWareStore.com now, available at drjonesandaggles.com, like TurboForce, 10-hour clean energy, next-level foundational energy that's not a stimulant, but cleans out the cells and has a huge stimulant effect with no letdown.
[00:05:19.184 --> 00:05:32.490]  Also, concentrated sprouts, that's the green caps, all the nano silver products, 57% off of the highest quality, 30 parts per million, little silver, silver bullet product, the immune support.
[00:05:33.993 --> 00:05:39.219]  All these products are absolutely A+, grade A, and they're available at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:43.084]  All right, while we're getting Roger on the line, give me your take on how epic this is.
[00:05:43.164 --> 00:05:45.306]  I mean, most of these other debates are lightweight stuff.
[00:05:45.867 --> 00:05:48.190]  There's not even been a Republican that could even challenge Trump in a debate.
[00:05:49.211 --> 00:05:51.414]  Biden shut down any other Democrat debate.
[00:05:52.194 --> 00:05:54.335]  Uh, and it just like he stole the election three and a half years ago.
[00:05:54.395 --> 00:05:57.616]  He's, he's, he's basically shut this down and locked out all his competition.
[00:05:57.656 --> 00:06:01.878]  So this is the first time he's got to get out of the basement or get off the beach and actually face somebody.
[00:06:01.898 --> 00:06:04.199]  This is a pissed off, born again, hard Donald Trump.
[00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:04.939]  What do you expect tonight?
[00:06:05.336 --> 00:06:09.759]  Well, there are so many things about this that are unprecedented, Alex, that it's hard to even know where to begin.
[00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:15.163]  First thing that comes to mind is we've got CNN privately hosting this debate.
[00:06:15.203 --> 00:06:20.426]  We know CNN in the last cycle cheated, actually two cycles ago with Hillary, cheated and gave her questions.
[00:06:20.446 --> 00:06:24.569]  I don't think there's been any major internal changes at CNN to make them suddenly not corrupt.
[00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:25.610]  That's the first aspect of this.
[00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:30.032]  Second thing is it's the earliest debate I believe in the history of presidential debates.
[00:06:30.073 --> 00:06:32.074]  I mean, none of the conventions have happened yet.
[00:06:32.374 --> 00:06:35.116]  We've got this bizarre, really late DNC convention.
[00:06:35.115 --> 00:06:36.836]  convention coming up in the fall.
[00:06:36.836 --> 00:06:38.755]  What you're saying is gonna be basically virtual as well.
[00:06:38.755 --> 00:06:42.156]   It's gonna be virtual, and so I honestly think that this is Joe Biden auditioning for
[00:06:42.156 --> 00:06:43.156]  his own job, Alex.
[00:06:43.156 --> 00:06:46.954]   I think you nailed it, though the Democrats have said, if he doesn't do well here, he
[00:06:46.954 --> 00:06:48.836]  will be replaced at the convention.
[00:06:48.836 --> 00:06:52.675]   Absolutely, and I mean, I think a lot of their strategies too as far as this debate
[00:06:52.675 --> 00:06:54.555]  being rigged are gonna backfire.
[00:06:54.931 --> 00:06:57.292]  Harrison, Owen and myself were talking about this during the first hour.
[00:06:57.692 --> 00:07:03.835]  Things like muting Donald Trump and allowing Joe Biden to speak is not like a major gotcha against Donald Trump.
[00:07:03.875 --> 00:07:10.578]  The more Joe Biden speaks, the more likely he is to have terrible gaffes and say something or do something incredibly embarrassing.
[00:07:11.098 --> 00:07:12.139]  I really think this is a win-win.
[00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:15.740]  I know it's 3-1 in terms of adding up the moderators and Joe Biden versus Donald Trump.
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.141]  He knows he's walking into a trap.
[00:07:17.901 --> 00:07:18.921]  He's not stupid.
[00:07:19.182 --> 00:07:21.343]  He's got some tricks up his sleeve that are going to revert this.
[00:07:21.363 --> 00:07:22.643]  It's going to blow back in their face, Alex.
[00:07:23.083 --> 00:07:25.684]  Well, this is also a dead cat bounce.
[00:07:25.784 --> 00:07:27.905]  I mean, CNN has 100,000 viewers on their average show.
[00:07:27.925 --> 00:07:28.886]  Their top show, a million.
[00:07:29.904 --> 00:07:33.625]  I mean, when Elon Musk puts out a video, it gets 200 million views on average.
[00:07:34.266 --> 00:07:35.446]  Joe Rogan, 50 million.
[00:07:35.566 --> 00:07:37.307]  Tucker Carlson, 50 million on average.
[00:07:37.327 --> 00:07:38.727]  Our show, 20 million a day.
[00:07:38.747 --> 00:07:41.608]  You know, we're right under the top shows, which I'm not in competition.
[00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:44.429]  I love the fact that there's people more prominent than me now talking about this.
[00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:47.550]  We were just, you know, the lone mavericks here, first up doing it.
[00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:48.890]  That's why we got targeted by the deep state.
[00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:55.333]   It's very refreshing to now see our worldview, which is the real worldview, Being the dominant force right now.
[00:07:55.633 --> 00:07:56.974]  So the whole world's Alex Jones now.
[00:07:57.014 --> 00:07:58.095]  It's not just Alex Jones is right.
[00:07:58.456 --> 00:07:59.877]  Everybody sounds like Alex Jones.
[00:07:59.977 --> 00:08:04.800]  And the more they try to demonize people, the more it backfires.
[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:12.306]  I want to play a short one minute clip from CNN this morning, where they're teaching you what a mute button is, like you're an idiot.
[00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:15.448]  But since when do they mute people's mics in a debate?
[00:08:15.508 --> 00:08:16.929]  Part of it is them going back and forth.
[00:08:17.289 --> 00:08:20.652]  And again, they're going to be able to try to give Biden more time, try to give him more questions.
[00:08:21.492 --> 00:08:25.133]  But I agree, that's going to backfire on him because the more he talks, the more he bumbles around.
[00:08:25.193 --> 00:08:30.714]  The big thing is they're trying to get Trump to be muted, to cut to him when you can't hear him to say, oh look, Trump looks like a fool.
[00:08:30.974 --> 00:08:31.695]  That's not going to work.
[00:08:31.915 --> 00:08:33.775]  People get he's targeted, it's going to backfire.
[00:08:33.795 --> 00:08:39.736]  They've got big TV trucks with, you know, jumbotrons on the sides driving around saying felon, criminal, you know.
[00:08:40.277 --> 00:08:41.657]  People get he's Robin Hood.
[00:08:42.842 --> 00:08:44.283]  Okay, the Yeti is Jesse James.
[00:08:44.703 --> 00:08:48.226]  He's got that folk hero mystique 2.0.
[00:08:48.506 --> 00:08:49.146]  It's not working.
[00:08:49.607 --> 00:08:51.228]  Now, we got Roger Stone coming on in a few minutes.
[00:08:51.248 --> 00:08:52.329]  Let me know when he's on the line, guys.
[00:08:52.769 --> 00:08:54.850]  But let's go ahead and go to some speakers on X. Sure.
[00:08:55.031 --> 00:08:56.452]  Well, let's start out with Kristen Megan.
[00:08:56.472 --> 00:08:59.734]  Kristen Megan, if you're still there, go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you have to say.
[00:09:01.693 --> 00:09:04.175]  Yeah, I'm so glad that you're doing this space.
[00:09:04.596 --> 00:09:09.761]  And I was just listening to the commentary, and what I'm thinking about this debate is first off, multiple things.
[00:09:10.581 --> 00:09:19.310]  One, all the lies that are shared through the ads and any gaffes or speeches that Biden gives, he's not ever instantly fact-checked.
[00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:26.697]  So although they're doing the muting of the microphone, hopefully Trump is able to, on the spot, be basically a community notes fact-checker.
[00:09:27.378 --> 00:09:32.601]  But also, we all know a history that Biden gets very irate and angry when things don't go his way.
[00:09:32.621 --> 00:09:34.722]  I have a father who has dementia.
[00:09:34.802 --> 00:09:36.804]  I've seen it myself, the lashes out of anger.
[00:09:36.824 --> 00:09:44.928]  And I would not be surprised to see him basically lose his shit on Trump and really show that he's not some just old, frail man.
[00:09:44.968 --> 00:09:48.470]  But I think his true colors show, and it's not just because of the dementia.
[00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:50.171]  So this is going to be very interesting.
[00:09:51.664 --> 00:10:01.570]  As a libertarian, it's just really funny because many of us have issues with Trump, but all these attacks are just bringing us closer and closer to just wanting to support and donate toward him.
[00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:09.935]  Because when we share the same common enemy, which is, you know, these globalists and these sociopaths, you know, we have to collectively work together.
[00:10:09.995 --> 00:10:12.957]  And I feel like it's going to be on full display tonight what's really going on.
[00:10:14.062 --> 00:10:16.723]  That's a great point, and I haven't checked in a few days.
[00:10:16.843 --> 00:10:17.643]  What's the latest?
[00:10:17.723 --> 00:10:23.065]  Trump since his show trial conviction less than a month ago had raised like $600, almost $700 million.
[00:10:23.325 --> 00:10:24.405]  What's the number now, Chase?
[00:10:24.645 --> 00:10:32.327]  I don't know what the number is off the top of my head, but the funny thing about that, Alex, is weren't they just bragging to the Biden administration about getting like $20 million from Bloomberg?
[00:10:32.347 --> 00:10:35.828]  So they have to get $20 million from one guy, or however many tens of millions it was.
[00:10:36.128 --> 00:10:38.909]  But Trump is literally raising hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:10:38.929 --> 00:10:40.929]  His average contribution, when I saw it last week, is $43.
[00:10:40.989 --> 00:10:41.090]  Yes.
[00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:43.550]  That's grassroots.
[00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:47.172]  I mean, it's four times any previous record for small donations.
[00:10:47.212 --> 00:10:47.432]  Yes.
[00:10:47.552 --> 00:10:49.873]  The last guy to get those donations was Donald Trump in 2016.
[00:10:50.494 --> 00:10:51.994]  Yep, when you put America first as a candidate.
[00:10:52.014 --> 00:10:52.395]  It's four times.
[00:10:52.955 --> 00:10:53.855]  America put you first.
[00:10:54.255 --> 00:10:55.356]  Yeah, that's an old number.
[00:10:56.096 --> 00:10:57.017]  It was 600 plus million.
[00:11:00.123 --> 00:11:00.883]  So that's not right.
[00:11:01.464 --> 00:11:04.465]  It was $600 million less than three weeks in.
[00:11:04.885 --> 00:11:05.105]  Right.
[00:11:05.125 --> 00:11:06.986]  $170 million at the end of May that they had.
[00:11:07.226 --> 00:11:08.306]  They've raised a lot of money.
[00:11:08.326 --> 00:11:09.487]  I'll just look it up, no problem.
[00:11:10.127 --> 00:11:13.289]  But yeah, I mean, how much has Trump raised since his conviction?
[00:11:13.489 --> 00:11:14.589]  That's the number we need.
[00:11:14.889 --> 00:11:16.110]  Notice that's like crickets now.
[00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:22.312]  At first it was like $100 million in one day, $200 million in four days, $300 million in a week and a half, $400 million in two weeks, $500 million in two and a half weeks.
[00:11:22.131 --> 00:11:25.691]   400 million in two weeks, 500 million in two and a half weeks.
[00:11:25.691 --> 00:11:28.171]  It was up to 600 million when I saw it.
[00:11:28.171 --> 00:11:34.011]   Just type this in, type in Trump raises 600 million since conviction.
[00:11:34.112 --> 00:11:35.073]  I saw that last Friday.
[00:11:35.453 --> 00:11:42.960]  So it's over $600 million, four times any previous record in that amount of time.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.421]  It's absolutely unbelievable.
[00:11:44.441 --> 00:11:45.782]  From record small donations.
[00:11:46.242 --> 00:11:46.462]  Yes.
[00:11:46.863 --> 00:11:48.924]  And you know, there's obviously more to it than just money.
[00:11:50.086 --> 00:11:53.309]  If money won elections by itself, Bloomberg would be the President of the United States.
[00:11:53.349 --> 00:11:54.370]  He spent an astronomical sum.
[00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:58.235]  But it's the symbol of raising that much in such a short period of time that's the indicator.
[00:11:58.255 --> 00:11:59.837]  It's not even the volume of money.
[00:12:00.057 --> 00:12:02.339]  It's the amount of people after these 34 convictions.
[00:12:02.379 --> 00:12:03.220]  It's the small donations.
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:03.601]  Yes.
[00:12:03.621 --> 00:12:04.302]  $43 at a time.
[00:12:06.615 --> 00:12:07.056]  43 on average.
[00:12:07.396 --> 00:12:07.776]  Wow.
[00:12:08.096 --> 00:12:08.717]  That's incredible.
[00:12:09.137 --> 00:12:10.878]  And that's the number, and I should have thought of that.
[00:12:11.579 --> 00:12:13.260]  But it was a lot of news for the first two weeks.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.020]  I noticed you didn't hear about it.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.421]  I had to dig for that last week.
[00:12:15.441 --> 00:12:18.803]  It was like, I think it was 620-something million dollars last Friday.
[00:12:18.823 --> 00:12:22.846]  In fact, my memory serves people that watch know I'm not.
[00:12:22.866 --> 00:12:23.907]  600 million in three weeks.
[00:12:24.247 --> 00:12:24.967]  That's absolutely insane.
[00:12:24.987 --> 00:12:26.128]  I've never heard anything like that before.
[00:12:26.148 --> 00:12:27.269]  I wonder what the record was before.
[00:12:29.198 --> 00:12:32.740]  Hey guys, I'm just glad to be on the air with you and be watching this debate tonight, man.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:33.300]  It's gonna be wild.
[00:12:33.159 --> 00:12:38.078]   donations in less than three weeks. So guys put do on it or put somebody on it
[00:12:38.078 --> 00:12:41.879]   because I want that number that's something they don't want discussed. Okay
[00:12:41.879 --> 00:12:45.159]   let's go to another speaker. Okay let's go to Wars of the Info. Wars of the Info
[00:12:45.159 --> 00:12:51.718]   go ahead and speak. Hey guys I'm just glad to be on the air with you and be
[00:12:51.718 --> 00:12:58.999]   watching this debate tonight man it's gonna be wild. What's that? No I'm here brother.
[00:12:59.032 --> 00:13:03.331]   I'm listening to you. Oh, yeah, no, no, so I'm just you know, I just can't believe it
[00:13:03.331 --> 00:13:08.412]   I mean the whole setup. I mean we can all easily see how they are
[00:13:08.412 --> 00:13:15.292]   I mean, it's the arrangement is insane. This has never gone on in American history, and it's just totally you know
[00:13:15.292 --> 00:13:18.891]   Everything is rigged. I mean we're living in a in a Hollywood
[00:13:18.919 --> 00:13:21.061]  We appreciate you joining us.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.600]  of just nonsense, that's what it is, and we all know it.
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.599]   And I've been listening to you so long, and thanks for the things you do,
[00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:31.160]  because it's taught me a lot of things, man.
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:38.680]   I just really respect you guys and this show a lot, and I don't really, that's about it, man, you know?
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.599]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[00:13:39.599 --> 00:13:41.279]  We appreciate you joining us.
[00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:42.259]  Next up, Chase.
[00:13:42.259 --> 00:13:45.599]  Yourself.
[00:13:45.599 --> 00:13:46.420]  I just lost your audio.
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:47.259]  That's okay.
[00:13:47.259 --> 00:13:48.080]  Let's start over.
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:48.920]  Let's start over.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:49.759]  Go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you gotta say.
[00:13:49.759 --> 00:13:52.099]  Chase.
[00:13:52.099 --> 00:13:57.520]   I just wanted to come in and say hi, and I appreciate that all of you are hosting
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:03.800]   the debate for this evening, as I'm certain that it will be quite comical.
[00:14:03.952 --> 00:14:06.674]  I'm sorry, that was my father speaking in the background.
[00:14:06.995 --> 00:14:11.779]  And anyways, my point is that stolen elections have consequences.
[00:14:12.535 --> 00:14:22.263]  And we're going to see Joe Biden, who is severely compromised by the Chinese Communist Party and virtually every NGO in existence on this planet.
[00:14:23.024 --> 00:14:27.287]  And I really, truly believe that it's going to be a national embarrassment for him.
[00:14:28.448 --> 00:14:33.572]  And again, this is round three, that he's up against President Trump.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:51.252]  I think that it's obvious that CNN has rigged the debate for Joe Biden because they have a track record of passing on the debate questions and they have not fixed this situation they have at CNN.
[00:14:51.452 --> 00:14:52.593]  They will do it again.
[00:14:53.434 --> 00:14:56.937]  So with saying that, I think that it will be a great night of comedy.
[00:14:58.198 --> 00:15:02.962]  So I appreciate that you're all hosting and I'll just stay on to listen.
[00:15:03.583 --> 00:15:04.364]  Thanks so much, guys.
[00:15:05.143 --> 00:15:06.204]  Thank you, Liz Churchill.
[00:15:06.264 --> 00:15:06.924]  Great points.
[00:15:06.964 --> 00:15:11.267]  We're going to have Robert Barnes and Roger Stone coming up before we go to the live debate here.
[00:15:11.287 --> 00:15:12.928]  Again, we're going to have live coverage right here.
[00:15:12.968 --> 00:15:14.529]  You will see it right here.
[00:15:14.569 --> 00:15:20.152]  You will hear the audio at Spaces on X and you will see the video at Real Alex Jones.
[00:15:20.172 --> 00:15:20.673]  Just go there.
[00:15:20.713 --> 00:15:21.673]  It's at the top of the page.
[00:15:22.134 --> 00:15:23.094]  Live coverage of the debate.
[00:15:23.234 --> 00:15:23.895]  Watch it here.
[00:15:24.495 --> 00:15:27.246]   And if you want to be Let's go to Colonel Gannon.
[00:15:27.266 --> 00:15:29.387]  Colonel, go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you have to say.
[00:15:29.407 --> 00:15:29.587]  Hey, yep.
[00:15:29.607 --> 00:15:31.368]  Chase, Alex, thank you guys so much for covering everything.
[00:15:31.388 --> 00:15:32.709]  Great job waking everybody up.
[00:15:32.528 --> 00:15:36.447]   you know and say watch the debate here with commentary by the most banned man in the world,
[00:15:36.447 --> 00:15:39.969]  Alex Jones and his crew. Chase Geiser, who's up next?
[00:15:39.969 --> 00:15:43.489]   Let's go to Colonel Gannon. Colonel, go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you have to say.
[00:15:43.489 --> 00:15:50.367]   Hey, yep. Chase, Alex, thank you guys so much for covering everything. Great job waking everybody
[00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:56.048]   up. I just want to say if I could give Trump one piece of advice, I would ask him to give
[00:15:56.048 --> 00:16:01.088]   Joe Biden the first 30 minutes and just say, look over him and go, it depends, but you know what,
[00:16:01.366 --> 00:16:11.576]  Why don't you just tell people why you should be reelected as president and I'm going to give you 30 minutes while the entire world is watching to speak and explain it to folks.
[00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:11.896]  You're right.
[00:16:11.936 --> 00:16:14.258]  He wouldn't totally, because all he's going to have is one-liners.
[00:16:14.278 --> 00:16:15.039]  He would disintegrate.
[00:16:16.954 --> 00:16:17.154]  Right.
[00:16:17.915 --> 00:16:30.385]  Just let him be exposed for the first 30 minutes and then the last hour is Trump actually being a human being, who was elected last time, by the way, and it would be over.
[00:16:30.405 --> 00:16:38.512]  I don't think it's going to happen that way, but man, if Trump would just let that man speak for 30 minutes while the entire world is watching, that's the end of Joe Biden.
[00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:42.850]   And Colonel Ganim, you're an amazing guy. I've been in a lot of spaces with you.
[00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:48.410]   You've also been a guest. You were the deputy commander of the forces there under Trump in South Korea for those huge
[00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:48.850]  events.
[00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:50.850]  You really know what you're talking about.
[00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:54.850]   What do you make of the documented whistleblowers and the new documents coming out
[00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:59.850]   that under Biden they're accelerating the building of internment camps for Americans?
[00:16:59.712 --> 00:17:05.335]  And then we have the Democrats all over the news saying, martial law is coming, civil war, we're going to arrest all the Trump supporters.
[00:17:05.715 --> 00:17:10.677]  This is ominous totalitarian desperateness from their side, but I'm very concerned.
[00:17:10.957 --> 00:17:12.398]  I'm sure you're aware of these developments.
[00:17:13.118 --> 00:17:16.500]  If you're not, you can pass on that, but I wanted to get your take on it as a military man.
[00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:23.793]  Yeah, so, I've been following your updates and the other updates on this.
[00:17:24.713 --> 00:17:33.317]  What I'm most terrified about is my fellow, the people that I served with, that are still in the service, those general officers now, not having the courage to stand up against it right now.
[00:17:33.337 --> 00:17:43.001]  Because I'm worried about the wokeness and the people who stuck around, or the people who didn't fight back, or the people who aren't fighting back in the military, that they would actually be willing to enforce these things.
[00:17:43.081 --> 00:17:44.162]  So, I don't know.
[00:17:44.182 --> 00:17:45.722]  We're on the precipice of that.
[00:17:46.322 --> 00:17:52.068]   I don't believe That we have, you know, good people at the DHS that have our best interests in mind.
[00:17:52.088 --> 00:17:54.190]  They're obviously spending money building these things.
[00:17:55.371 --> 00:18:01.257]  Now, the question is, are there enough collaborators in the machine to do it?
[00:18:01.377 --> 00:18:02.738]  I don't think there are right now, Alex.
[00:18:02.778 --> 00:18:04.980]  I think we've woken enough people up, but I don't know that.
[00:18:07.182 --> 00:18:13.744]  The horrifying thing to me is that there's no one in the military, not one general officer has come up and said, you know what, I'm putting my stars on the line.
[00:18:14.104 --> 00:18:16.805]  You poison the entire United States military with a vaccine.
[00:18:16.825 --> 00:18:23.107]  And because they won't come forward with that, I'm worried that those same type folks would be the kind of folks that would run us into those internment camps.
[00:18:24.349 --> 00:18:52.601]  Well I totally agree with you and it shows complete desperation that they're pre-programming this in the news both in news and in fiction with all these movies and it just shows the desperation that the establishment should just pull back like a moray eel into their hole and come back later but instead they want the confrontation now that's why we've all got to be completely peaceful and not be lured into any confrontations because we're winning hearts and minds right now they're failing on every front and all they're hoping for is some type of violent confrontation.
[00:18:55.194 --> 00:18:55.895]  Amen, Alex.
[00:18:55.915 --> 00:19:09.123]  There's no doubt that what they would like to see, what the elites would like to see more than ever, is for us to try to destroy ourselves or get into something that gave them the precursor they needed to bring on totalitarian control.
[00:19:09.163 --> 00:19:19.490]  But more than that, to convince enough general officers and lower-level people down to the colonel level to take actions that they wouldn't normally undertake, kind of like 9-11, maybe even like October 7th, like you saw in Israel.
[00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:24.789]  You made some good points on the civilian camps that are setting up on record.
[00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:28.632]  Getting back to any other points, the point you made about Trump was excellent.
[00:19:29.252 --> 00:19:38.639]  I'm really concerned about all the rigging we've seen here, and how they've got the mute on, and we know the past debates, they give hard questions to Trump, softballs to Biden, now they cut Trump off.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:44.584]  I'm really concerned, and I know Trump's a lion, but he is literally marching into a den of criminals right now.
[00:19:46.482 --> 00:19:52.126]  Yeah, my guess is he's going to go in there very calm and just kind of the expectable.
[00:19:52.626 --> 00:20:04.454]  The kind of thing that makes me concerned about President Trump is that he's going to go in there and he's used to having an audience where he basically gets energy off of the people around him and those people won't be there and all he's going to have is a couple demons in the room.
[00:20:04.574 --> 00:20:10.138]  It sounds to me like the press is not even being allowed to be in there other than the two CNN moderators.
[00:20:10.258 --> 00:20:17.473]   One of them, who's I think her husband, Actually signed the thing saying Hunter Biden's laptop wasn't real.
[00:20:17.513 --> 00:20:22.457]  He was the leader of the 51 intelligence agents and chiefs that were caught lying.
[00:20:22.958 --> 00:20:26.501]  NSA heads, CIA heads, he's a real ringleader.
[00:20:26.541 --> 00:20:28.042]  So yeah, well you're a smart guy.
[00:20:28.062 --> 00:20:28.763]  Let me ask you this.
[00:20:28.783 --> 00:20:30.104]  I want to get Chase's take.
[00:20:30.564 --> 00:20:35.228]  Why would they want no one in there but the moderators Trump and Biden?
[00:20:35.288 --> 00:20:35.989]  That is creepy.
[00:20:37.265 --> 00:20:38.445]  It is, and it's beyond creepy.
[00:20:38.565 --> 00:20:44.967]  And so a couple things kind of ran through my head as that kind of came out today, especially with the, I'm hearing there's a one to two minute delay, right?
[00:20:45.387 --> 00:20:49.508]  So if that's the case, there's, I'm worried about Trump's physical safety in there, right?
[00:20:49.588 --> 00:20:52.109]  He's isolated in that room with people.
[00:20:52.169 --> 00:20:57.351]  I hope the Secret Service are, his, his detail are within arm's reach of him at all time.
[00:20:57.391 --> 00:21:02.172]  And frankly, they probably should have their guns trained on anyone, any live human being in that place.
[00:21:02.332 --> 00:21:05.574]  And Colonel, let me just stop because you're so dead on and I forgot to mention that.
[00:21:06.014 --> 00:21:09.676]  They announced this morning, normally for TV there's a 10 second delay.
[00:21:09.756 --> 00:21:11.516]  We have a 10 second, it's FCC.
[00:21:11.997 --> 00:21:15.038]  People that are just internet go, why can't you cuss or why is there a delay?
[00:21:15.098 --> 00:21:15.678]  It's the law.
[00:21:16.119 --> 00:21:17.139]  We have a 10 second delay.
[00:21:17.539 --> 00:21:19.540]  Nobody runs more than a 15 second.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.501]  The NFL does that.
[00:21:21.001 --> 00:21:22.063]  For whatever weird reasons.
[00:21:22.543 --> 00:21:25.047]  Nobody runs a 30 second or 1 minute or 2 minute.
[00:21:25.107 --> 00:21:25.708]  I saw that.
[00:21:26.108 --> 00:21:27.490]  A 2 minute delay?
[00:21:27.951 --> 00:21:28.912]  That is weird.
[00:21:29.112 --> 00:21:30.474]  That is unprecedented.
[00:21:30.494 --> 00:21:30.775]  Why?
[00:21:31.055 --> 00:21:35.662]  What are they scared is going to be said that they may want to just shut everything down, Colonel?
[00:21:37.057 --> 00:21:43.442]  I think one would be basic risk mitigation, which is Joe Biden collapses on stage, right?
[00:21:43.462 --> 00:21:44.983]  Because he can't stand up for 90 minutes.
[00:21:45.003 --> 00:21:48.726]  He poops his pants because he did in front of the Pope and other folks, right?
[00:21:48.746 --> 00:21:51.889]  So we know he's got all those issues going on.
[00:21:52.069 --> 00:22:10.792]   Or Biden goes completely spacey and they just need to stop the production for a minute to try to There's no coming back from that anyway, but what I what I am concerned about because Exactly other cameras are allowed in it gives them total control which shows how they're gambling With this hopped up dementia patient.
[00:22:10.972 --> 00:22:11.692]  This guy's smart.
[00:22:12.032 --> 00:22:13.253]  See I wouldn't even have thought of that.
[00:22:13.273 --> 00:22:36.751]   Keep going, Colonel So, you know there so that's the the Joe Biden portion of it, right he could collapse or whatever But I what I truly worry about is the safety the physical safety of President Trump because if they have two minutes and if his his And by the way, I saw articles on CNN and the Washington Post saying they're predicting one of them will have a medical emergency.
[00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:41.730]   I would not put it past the demons that poisoned everyone in the entire United States military
[00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:44.130]  to hit him with a direct energy weapon.
[00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:49.089]   And by the way, I saw articles on CNN and the Washington Post saying they're predicting
[00:22:49.089 --> 00:22:54.170]   one of them will have a medic, guys type in, experts believe one of the two candidates
[00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:55.370]  will have a medical emergency.
[00:22:55.370 --> 00:23:00.890]  That's a ridiculous, so what do you make of that?
[00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:05.170]  Well, in normal times, Alex, I couldn't even believe it.
[00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:09.289]   But we're at a point where the leadership of the United States military, the entire
[00:23:09.289 --> 00:23:14.410]   United States military leadership poisoned the entire United States military with a poison
[00:23:14.769 --> 00:23:17.070]  So, everything is on the table, you know?
[00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:22.673]  I mean, we're literally at this spiritual battle, and the question is, do we have enough good people around him?
[00:23:22.693 --> 00:23:24.394]  And I pray, I mean, I really pray.
[00:23:25.327 --> 00:23:30.812]  Smart people around him that have looked at these things, because I don't put... I mean, think about it.
[00:23:31.332 --> 00:23:32.813]  The woman, is it Dana Bash?
[00:23:32.873 --> 00:23:33.674]  Is it her husband?
[00:23:33.694 --> 00:23:35.976]  That was the... Spooks, yes.
[00:23:36.036 --> 00:23:37.737]  Okay, so Dana Bash is there.
[00:23:38.057 --> 00:23:44.102]  Her husband said the Hunter laptop wasn't true, and it's got child pornography on it that Hunter is engaged in.
[00:23:44.122 --> 00:23:45.643]  Well, let's be clear.
[00:23:45.684 --> 00:23:52.089]  He was a ringleader creating the plan for the 51 intelligence people, but you hit the nail on the head here.
[00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:57.333]  That they are completely desperate, God knows what they're going to do, and why would they have a two-minute delay?
[00:23:57.433 --> 00:24:02.856]  Wow, this is... Man, I'm glad you called in because I was thinking about that, but I didn't think to bring it up.
[00:24:02.936 --> 00:24:03.796]  That is crazy.
[00:24:04.157 --> 00:24:05.097]  Chase, what do you think is happening?
[00:24:05.117 --> 00:24:06.398]  We've got a final comment from the Colonel.
[00:24:06.598 --> 00:24:22.147]  Well, the Biden administration has come out and said, the campaign has come out and said, or CNN has come out and said that they don't want an audience there because they don't want Donald Trump to be able to feed off of the audience, which is a bizarre thing to say because you're sort of admitting that the audience... Well, they usually pack it with donors anyway!
[00:24:22.327 --> 00:24:23.007]  Right.
[00:24:23.067 --> 00:24:25.928]  Are you admitting that the audience would be more likely to be supportive of Trump?
[00:24:25.968 --> 00:24:26.688]  Is he more popular?
[00:24:26.708 --> 00:24:27.268]  That's the first thing.
[00:24:27.288 --> 00:24:37.090]  So I think the real reason, I think we're hitting it on the head here, is that they don't want anybody in there with their phones capturing videos and they don't want any witnesses in the event that something embarrassing happens, that they have to take off of the live stream.
[00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:38.830]  They don't want people doing viral videos.
[00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:44.371]  And that's why they're saying in a press release, don't even play clips, don't even have commentary.
[00:24:44.591 --> 00:24:44.812]  Right.
[00:24:45.192 --> 00:24:46.932]  Which we're going to violate that right now.
[00:24:47.512 --> 00:24:54.442]  Yeah, well, I mean, they say that it's an intellectual property argument, they want to monetize the content, but the fact of the matter is they just want to control the narrative.
[00:24:54.462 --> 00:24:59.369]  Well, must check with his lawyers, and I've said this days ago, the DMCA takedowns do not apply here.
[00:24:59.409 --> 00:25:01.091]  This is public, fair use, 100%.
[00:25:01.452 --> 00:25:03.435]  This is the classic thing of presidential debate.
[00:25:03.968 --> 00:25:04.388]  Absolutely.
[00:25:04.428 --> 00:25:13.814]  Well, even if you want to do commentary on YouTube on movies, you can show clips from Hollywood movies and talk about them as long as you're talking about them and not just rebroadcasting the intellectual property.
[00:25:13.854 --> 00:25:14.975]  It's not pirating or illegal.
[00:25:15.355 --> 00:25:18.717]  And fiction productions are the most protected because they really don't matter.
[00:25:18.837 --> 00:25:19.037]  Right.
[00:25:19.277 --> 00:25:20.318]  So they're the least protected.
[00:25:20.338 --> 00:25:20.778]  You can do it.
[00:25:20.858 --> 00:25:21.258]  Exactly.
[00:25:21.298 --> 00:25:23.860]  But a live presidential or political event is fair use.
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.521]  Absolutely ridiculous that they want to control.
[00:25:25.541 --> 00:25:27.162]  Colonel, you've made a lot of excellent points.
[00:25:27.202 --> 00:25:28.883]  I keep interrupting because you're so on target.
[00:25:28.923 --> 00:25:29.943]  Give us more of your knowledge.
[00:25:29.983 --> 00:25:30.884]  What else are you worried about?
[00:25:34.931 --> 00:25:35.853]  I'm worried about my granddaughter.
[00:25:35.874 --> 00:25:38.360]  I'm worried about, you know, my family just like you are Alex.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.047]  And thank God you guys are just telling the truth every single day.
[00:25:43.643 --> 00:25:47.805]  I wish I was listening to you and more people were listening to you before 9-11.
[00:25:47.825 --> 00:25:49.826]  Because if it was happening, maybe they wouldn't have done it, right?
[00:25:49.745 --> 00:25:53.825]   Like you guys all have, I think we're going to get through this.
[00:25:53.825 --> 00:25:57.265]   I think it's good to talk about these things in front of hand because if there's bad ideas
[00:25:57.265 --> 00:26:01.664]   and places out there, I wish I was listening to you and more people were listening to you
[00:26:01.664 --> 00:26:06.225]   before 9/11 because if it was happening, maybe they wouldn't have done it.
[00:26:06.225 --> 00:26:07.225]  God bless you, Alex.
[00:26:07.225 --> 00:26:08.225]  God bless you.
[00:26:08.225 --> 00:26:10.545]   And Colonel, by the way, I wasn't kissing your ass saying you brought up some great
[00:26:10.951 --> 00:26:12.212]  You just knocked it out of the park.
[00:26:12.312 --> 00:26:14.354]  I mean, that was powerful.
[00:26:14.494 --> 00:26:15.335]  Yeah, sharp as a whip.
[00:26:15.355 --> 00:26:15.835]  Great cast.
[00:26:16.035 --> 00:26:16.216]  Yeah.
[00:26:16.716 --> 00:26:17.237]  Who's up next?
[00:26:17.357 --> 00:26:18.838]  All right, let's go next to Free the World.
[00:26:18.878 --> 00:26:21.620]  Free the World, go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you have to say if you're still with us.
[00:26:24.323 --> 00:26:26.185]  Yeah, I'm still here if you guys can hear me.
[00:26:26.245 --> 00:26:28.947]  I don't have the best device or equipment here.
[00:26:33.834 --> 00:26:34.854]  Looks like we might have lost you.
[00:26:35.174 --> 00:26:37.475]  Hold on, I'll go back to you but I want to say something.
[00:26:38.535 --> 00:26:39.016]  Hold for a minute.
[00:26:39.516 --> 00:26:43.117]  Liz Churchill said she's sorry her dad's talking in the background and she's taken care of.
[00:26:43.497 --> 00:26:44.197]  We love that.
[00:26:44.557 --> 00:26:45.818]  This lady's got a bad connection.
[00:26:46.118 --> 00:26:46.638]  It's okay.
[00:26:46.698 --> 00:26:47.898]  We love regular people.
[00:26:48.198 --> 00:26:49.519]  We're all about regular people.
[00:26:49.539 --> 00:26:50.439]  We're about people power.
[00:26:50.959 --> 00:26:51.680]  We love this.
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.622]  This show is about the regular common folk.
[00:26:54.722 --> 00:26:55.463]  I'm common folk.
[00:26:55.983 --> 00:26:56.864]  About saying no.
[00:26:56.944 --> 00:26:59.046]  So don't ever thank us for having you on.
[00:26:59.106 --> 00:27:02.609]  Don't ever get sad that you stumbled.
[00:27:02.949 --> 00:27:04.491]  We want real people engaged.
[00:27:04.531 --> 00:27:05.071]  Thank you, ma'am.
[00:27:05.251 --> 00:27:05.832]  Please continue.
[00:27:08.192 --> 00:27:09.373]  Oh yeah, you're good.
[00:27:09.413 --> 00:27:09.653]  Thank you.
[00:27:09.673 --> 00:27:10.654]  Go ahead.
[00:27:10.854 --> 00:27:11.934]  Yeah, no, I'm here.
[00:27:11.954 --> 00:27:13.375]  I'm still late a little bit.
[00:27:13.415 --> 00:27:18.058]  But yeah, so I think President Trump, he needs to do exactly what you were saying for the general public.
[00:27:18.098 --> 00:27:19.319]  He needs to stay calm tonight.
[00:27:19.699 --> 00:27:22.060]  He needs to hit on the real points.
[00:27:22.161 --> 00:27:24.462]  And I know he's kind of an attack dog, which is good.
[00:27:24.502 --> 00:27:25.443]  We love that about him.
[00:27:25.903 --> 00:27:28.765]  But I think anything that he does, they're going to use against him this time.
[00:27:28.805 --> 00:27:30.946]  That's why they have the ability to mute his mic.
[00:27:31.146 --> 00:27:34.208]  And they are really twisting everything with the medical emergency.
[00:27:34.748 --> 00:27:36.250]  You know, it's a risk for President Trump.
[00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:39.434]  It's also an excuse for President Biden to bow out if things get bad.
[00:27:39.494 --> 00:27:41.616]  They can say, you know, his health has been bad.
[00:27:41.676 --> 00:27:42.557]  We saw this coming.
[00:27:42.597 --> 00:27:46.642]  They can use that as an excuse so that he doesn't look bad in the media.
[00:27:46.662 --> 00:27:48.304]  Well, that's right.
[00:27:48.344 --> 00:27:51.207]  I saw this afternoon the new change of a two-minute delay.
[00:27:51.248 --> 00:27:52.109]  That's unprecedented.
[00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:53.150]  That creeps me out.
[00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:57.952]  Yeah, well CNN did come out and backpedal and say that they weren't really doing that, but I think they're lying.
[00:27:57.992 --> 00:27:58.792]  I mean, they lie all the time.
[00:27:58.832 --> 00:28:02.914]  So this morning it was rumored they were going to do two minutes, then they said it's not true, it's just a conspiracy theory.
[00:28:03.214 --> 00:28:04.495]  I doubt that they're not going to do it.
[00:28:04.955 --> 00:28:06.376]  It seems like exactly in their playbook.
[00:28:07.671 --> 00:28:08.872]  Yeah, I think they are too.
[00:28:08.892 --> 00:28:11.493]  I think it's an excuse for them to try to cut things out.
[00:28:11.594 --> 00:28:17.017]  Anything where Biden looks bad, anything where Trump looks good, I think they're gonna do their best to manipulate that however they can.
[00:28:17.597 --> 00:28:27.422]   And I forget who touched on it earlier, it might have been before Alex got here, but someone had mentioned the whole VP debacle, you know, was he gonna to mention his VP tonight.
[00:28:27.422 --> 00:28:30.081]   And I just quickly wanted to throw that in and say I think that he
[00:28:30.081 --> 00:28:30.902]  should.
[00:28:30.902 --> 00:28:35.102]   And it is partially because I think if he mentions his VP now,
[00:28:35.102 --> 00:28:38.641]   there's less of a chance that they're going to try to do
[00:28:38.641 --> 00:28:42.681]   something to him if he picks someone who is like a real bulldog,
[00:28:42.681 --> 00:28:45.800]   someone who they are afraid to put in that seat.
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:49.261]   Because we want someone as VP where they don't want to get rid of
[00:28:49.261 --> 00:28:52.500]   Trump because he's just as bad or just as good in our view.
[00:28:52.778 --> 00:28:56.141]  So somebody like, they mentioned Vivek, I think it would be a great choice.
[00:28:56.601 --> 00:29:00.203]  Somebody very outspoken and very tough that they just can't shut up.
[00:29:00.223 --> 00:29:06.888]  Well the word is, the word is, the word is, it's JD Vance or Carson.
[00:29:08.277 --> 00:29:08.477]  Yeah.
[00:29:08.938 --> 00:29:09.799]  He put out that list.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.302]  People are hoping for Vivek, though.
[00:29:11.622 --> 00:29:13.605]  You just don't think it's going to happen, Alex?
[00:29:14.707 --> 00:29:15.909]  Let her have her final comment.
[00:29:15.929 --> 00:29:17.151]  What were you going to say?
[00:29:19.733 --> 00:29:22.435]  Yeah, so I honestly, I'm not entirely sure.
[00:29:22.515 --> 00:29:23.616]  I'm hoping it's Vivek.
[00:29:23.736 --> 00:29:25.737]  I'm going to just keep my hope alive for now.
[00:29:25.817 --> 00:29:28.199]  But if it was Carson, I think he's trustworthy.
[00:29:28.219 --> 00:29:30.781]  He's just a kind of a quiet, softer spoken guy.
[00:29:30.821 --> 00:29:32.282]  So that makes me a little anxious.
[00:29:32.842 --> 00:29:39.367]  And as for JD Vance, my only worries there are he used to be a very strong Never Trumper and you never know anymore.
[00:29:39.447 --> 00:29:42.429]  Like it just makes me really a little bit anxious there.
[00:29:42.449 --> 00:29:43.210]  But thank you, Alex.
[00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:43.790]  I appreciate you.
[00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:44.250]  You're awesome.
[00:29:45.815 --> 00:29:46.715]  I ran into J.D.
[00:29:46.735 --> 00:29:51.196]  Vance and had a conversation with him at the TPUSA action event in Detroit.
[00:29:51.216 --> 00:29:56.257]  We had an interesting behind-the-scenes conversation, I'll leave it at that.
[00:29:56.757 --> 00:29:59.858]  But the word is, it's down to Carson and him.
[00:30:01.858 --> 00:30:05.599]  What was your impression of them, just man-to-man meeting them?
[00:30:05.639 --> 00:30:06.139]  You were there.
[00:30:06.159 --> 00:30:07.959]  Yeah, I saw it, but I wasn't in on the conversation.
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:10.740]  Just vibes.
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.782]  You know, I don't want to hurt the campaign, because they'll use it.
[00:30:14.842 --> 00:30:16.123]  I'm not going to talk about it until later.
[00:30:16.423 --> 00:30:16.964]  Makes sense.
[00:30:17.044 --> 00:30:20.947]  But, I mean, he defended me when he was running for Senate.
[00:30:21.007 --> 00:30:21.827]  He defended me since.
[00:30:22.668 --> 00:30:24.289]  And so that takes a lot of guts.
[00:30:24.309 --> 00:30:27.211]  He's also been against the Ukraine war and a bunch of other stuff.
[00:30:27.271 --> 00:30:29.933]  So I know he wasn't perfect, you know, seven, eight years ago.
[00:30:29.953 --> 00:30:31.714]  And I get that.
[00:30:31.774 --> 00:30:32.335]  Trump likes him.
[00:30:32.775 --> 00:30:32.955]  Yeah.
[00:30:33.215 --> 00:30:36.918]  So I had a very interesting discussion with him and his chief of staff.
[00:30:36.938 --> 00:30:37.678]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:39.840]  They're big listeners.
[00:30:40.341 --> 00:30:40.521]  Yeah.
[00:30:40.821 --> 00:30:42.683]  I mean, why does Vance DeFennemy out of the blue?
[00:30:42.743 --> 00:30:48.388]  I mean, I think he gets, you see, instead of running from people attacked by the corporate media, we should run towards it.
[00:30:48.808 --> 00:30:53.856]   And they're now getting, being an outlaw, When you have a tyranny, then the patriots are outlaws.
[00:30:54.577 --> 00:30:55.377]  And that's what they get.
[00:30:55.457 --> 00:30:57.399]  Oh, God, Trump's been indicted, now convicted.
[00:30:57.419 --> 00:30:58.000]  He's more popular.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.361]  Like, well, we should have Alex Jones here.
[00:30:59.761 --> 00:31:02.683]  And, of course, I was, you know, they admitted, like, the biggest thing they've had in years.
[00:31:03.144 --> 00:31:04.165]  I'm trying to, like, say I'm great.
[00:31:04.585 --> 00:31:05.746]  That's why I'm going on tour with Tucker.
[00:31:06.427 --> 00:31:08.528]  And that's a whole other story right there.
[00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:12.392]  The stuff behind the scenes, trying to stop that, which only makes Tucker want me to be on the tour with him more.
[00:31:12.812 --> 00:31:13.773]  That'll be announced soon.
[00:31:14.133 --> 00:31:14.553]  Absolutely.
[00:31:14.593 --> 00:31:16.114]  Who do we got next?
[00:31:16.134 --> 00:31:16.895]  Let's go to Harry Fisher.
[00:31:16.915 --> 00:31:19.317]  Harry Fisher, go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you have to say if you're with us.
[00:31:19.337 --> 00:31:19.877]  Hey, how's it going?
[00:31:20.096 --> 00:31:21.737]  A lot of exciting things happening.
[00:31:21.737 --> 00:31:25.257]   Again, it's not about me, but it's about I've been so demonized because they're scared of
[00:31:25.257 --> 00:31:26.257]  what I actually say.
[00:31:26.257 --> 00:31:29.257]   It's not the straw man they built, it's actually what we're covering.
[00:31:29.257 --> 00:31:30.257]  Absolutely.
[00:31:30.257 --> 00:31:31.257]  Who do we got next?
[00:31:31.257 --> 00:31:32.257]  Let's go to Harry Fisher.
[00:31:32.257 --> 00:31:35.257]   Harry Fisher, go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you have to say if you're with
[00:31:35.257 --> 00:31:36.257]  us.
[00:31:36.257 --> 00:31:37.257]  Hey, how's it going?
[00:31:37.257 --> 00:31:43.737]   I'm curious to see if CNN tries to utilize the shots since Trump hasn't seemed to really
[00:31:43.737 --> 00:31:44.896]  demonize the shots.
[00:31:44.896 --> 00:31:46.656]  He has talked about not mandating it.
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:51.903]  I'm wondering if they're going to try to make him lose a little bit of his base by having him glorify it.
[00:31:52.063 --> 00:31:57.106]  You know, if I was them, I would use that against him, but because they're so in the pocket of Pfizer, I don't think they'd touch it.
[00:31:57.126 --> 00:32:00.368]  I don't want to get criticized.
[00:32:00.428 --> 00:32:03.249]  No, but that's a great angle.
[00:32:03.289 --> 00:32:04.510]  What else do you think is going to happen, Harry?
[00:32:07.324 --> 00:32:11.826]  That for sure, and then I've been wondering if they're going to actually even let him talk.
[00:32:12.006 --> 00:32:15.167]  If I was Donald Trump right now, I would be learning sign language.
[00:32:15.327 --> 00:32:24.250]  I mean, if they're going to shut your mic off, it'd be nice if we could just have someone just interpreting the stuff he's trying to say to Joe Biden while Joe Biden's just mumbling on stage.
[00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:29.412]  Well, you know, if I had time, because I haven't thought about this, if I want to get a message to Trump, I can talk to him.
[00:32:29.872 --> 00:32:31.773]  But I don't know if Trump knows about acoustics.
[00:32:31.793 --> 00:32:32.753]  But Harry, let me put you on hold.
[00:32:32.773 --> 00:32:33.694]  Let me show you something right now.
[00:32:34.494 --> 00:32:35.515]  Guys, can you do this?
[00:32:35.535 --> 00:32:42.960]  I don't know if you... Turn my microphone off, which is similar to the lavs they're going to be wearing, or the desk mics they're going to have.
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:48.303]  And I'm going to show you how it doesn't stop you if they turn your mic off.
[00:32:48.663 --> 00:32:50.663]  So go ahead and turn my mic off.
[00:32:50.663 --> 00:32:55.163]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:32:55.163 --> 00:32:56.163]  Maybe wire to the same system.
[00:32:56.429 --> 00:32:58.110]  We're not really set up to do that.
[00:32:58.910 --> 00:32:59.771]  Just tell me if we can't.
[00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:15.789]  We can't, it's okay.
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:20.122]  Free Studios Active is a special circumstance, so everybody's just running around.
[00:33:22.804 --> 00:33:37.572]  Okay, so... So, I want to show people that if you turn this microphone off, which is not turned off, or is turned off now, they're not talking to me, so I'm just going to stop.
[00:33:40.174 --> 00:33:40.434]  Wow.
[00:33:40.614 --> 00:33:42.095]  Okay, so my mic is off.
[00:33:43.365 --> 00:33:43.726]  Is it off?
[00:33:44.346 --> 00:33:45.228]  Is it off?
[00:33:45.048 --> 00:33:46.247]  So my mic is off right now.
[00:33:46.247 --> 00:33:52.367]  Maybe we can try again later.
[00:33:52.367 --> 00:33:53.528]  No, I like it.
[00:33:54.249 --> 00:33:56.249]   I don't even know cats got their tongues or what, they got mics.
[00:33:56.249 --> 00:33:57.249]  It's up to me.
[00:33:57.249 --> 00:34:00.249]  I'm not worried about you guys, you can turn off the mic.
[00:34:00.249 --> 00:34:01.249]  My mic is off, 100%.
[00:34:01.249 --> 00:34:02.249]  My mic is off, 100%, thank you.
[00:34:02.249 --> 00:34:03.249]  Okay, so my mic's off.
[00:34:03.249 --> 00:34:04.249]  You can hear me right now, Chase.
[00:34:04.249 --> 00:34:05.249]  I want to just show people this.
[00:34:05.249 --> 00:34:06.249]   So all Trump's got to do is look right where Biden is, 10 feet away, you're like 8 feet
[00:34:06.249 --> 00:34:07.249]  away, and say, "You know what?
[00:34:07.249 --> 00:34:08.248]  You're full of crap.
[00:34:08.248 --> 00:34:09.248]  Don't sit there getting all the attention."
[00:34:09.248 --> 00:34:10.248]  And I'm not worried about you guys.
[00:34:10.248 --> 00:34:11.248]  I'm not worried about you guys.
[00:34:11.248 --> 00:34:12.248]  I'm not worried about you guys.
[00:34:12.248 --> 00:34:13.248]  I'm not worried about you guys.
[00:34:13.248 --> 00:34:14.248]  I'm not worried about you guys.
[00:34:14.248 --> 00:34:15.248]  I'm not worried about you guys.
[00:34:15.248 --> 00:34:16.248]  Don't sit there.
[00:34:16.428 --> 00:34:17.749]  You can't turn my mic off!
[00:34:17.789 --> 00:34:19.329]  They can't turn his mic off!
[00:34:19.749 --> 00:34:21.330]  And I wanted to illustrate this to everybody.
[00:34:21.930 --> 00:34:32.354]  So, whenever Trump sees them cutting him off, he's stuck 30 seconds, Biden is 3 minutes, he's a turn and say, Biden, your son's a crackhead, you're a communist Chinese agent, inflation's doubled under you, you're a fraud.
[00:34:33.075 --> 00:34:33.775]  Now, you see that?
[00:34:33.795 --> 00:34:34.915]  Yeah.
[00:34:34.935 --> 00:34:35.996]  That's the point I wanted to make.
[00:34:36.196 --> 00:34:36.416]  Yeah.
[00:34:36.836 --> 00:34:38.237]  Well... Can you turn my mic back on?
[00:34:38.277 --> 00:34:38.537]  Go ahead.
[00:34:38.837 --> 00:34:40.938]  It'll be interesting to see if they mute both mics in that event.
[00:34:41.318 --> 00:34:43.959]  Just so... Well, I think that's why they want total control.
[00:34:44.079 --> 00:34:44.259]  Yes.
[00:34:45.871 --> 00:34:46.571]  All right, who's up next?
[00:34:46.972 --> 00:34:49.213]  Okay, let's go next to Health Uncensored.
[00:34:49.233 --> 00:34:51.253]  Health Uncensored, go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you got to say.
[00:34:52.914 --> 00:34:55.275]  I'm just curious to ask a question.
[00:34:55.655 --> 00:34:57.676]  You know, I voted for Trump in 2016.
[00:34:57.816 --> 00:34:58.477]  I had high hopes.
[00:34:58.997 --> 00:35:03.199]  I thought it was going to be the change our country needed, you know, and bring changes to our government.
[00:35:04.339 --> 00:35:12.183]  I think a big problem nowadays with what's going on in our country, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, is something known as regulatory capture.
[00:35:12.922 --> 00:35:15.784]  And during Trump's presidency, I was disappointed.
[00:35:16.844 --> 00:35:19.685]  He had a big pharma executive running the human health services.
[00:35:20.166 --> 00:35:24.008]  He had a lobbyist for the coal industry running the EPA.
[00:35:24.048 --> 00:35:32.652]  The man he appointed to run the FDA, Scott Gottlieb, went on to join the board of directors at Pfizer when he was done with his tenure in the FDA.
[00:35:32.972 --> 00:35:36.354]  He had a lawyer for telecom company Verizon running the FCC.
[00:35:36.834 --> 00:35:42.297]  So another one of those classic cases of the fox guarding the hen house across the board.
[00:35:43.058 --> 00:35:45.741]  Yeah, let me respond to that.
[00:35:45.561 --> 00:35:48.861]   know there isn't much talk of them but I was curious to hear Alex or Chase or
[00:35:48.861 --> 00:35:53.240]   any of the other speakers what's your opinion on Bobby Kennedy jr. Thanks for
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:57.681]   letting me ask a question. Yeah let me respond to that I think your criticism
[00:35:57.681 --> 00:36:03.798]   and your concerns about Trump is very well grounded And I think it's very responsible.
[00:36:04.479 --> 00:36:05.799]  And I've been a big critic of Trump.
[00:36:06.299 --> 00:36:07.840]  And I'm not a lesser of two evils, guys.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:15.463]  But the power structure in control now hates his guts because he really tried to be the president and did what he thought was best.
[00:36:15.503 --> 00:36:16.264]  He made a lot of mistakes.
[00:36:16.884 --> 00:36:18.564]  And I know Trump well and people that know him well.
[00:36:18.945 --> 00:36:19.805]  He is his own man.
[00:36:19.845 --> 00:36:20.645]  You don't tell him what to do.
[00:36:20.985 --> 00:36:29.370]   But he has some weird understandings, almost autistic, has incredible energy, super smart in ways, but also You know, it would take two hours to explain it.
[00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:31.091]  He said hydroxychloroquine.
[00:36:31.131 --> 00:36:32.131]  He said ivermectin.
[00:36:32.992 --> 00:36:35.294]  They told him we can't open the country forever.
[00:36:35.314 --> 00:36:37.055]  And he said, well, that's going to cause a depression.
[00:36:37.075 --> 00:36:38.456]  So he said, speed everything up.
[00:36:38.736 --> 00:36:40.177]  And they went, well, here's this thing, sir.
[00:36:40.237 --> 00:36:42.078]  We can't speed it up when they already had it ready.
[00:36:42.398 --> 00:36:43.379]  So they set him up.
[00:36:43.759 --> 00:36:44.900]  I wish he would expose that.
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.842]  I don't need him to say that because that's my theory.
[00:36:48.002 --> 00:36:48.843]  I know that happened.
[00:36:49.183 --> 00:36:50.084]  And Trump's pigheaded.
[00:36:50.124 --> 00:36:50.804]  That's why they hate him.
[00:36:50.864 --> 00:36:52.245]  He won't do what they say.
[00:36:52.325 --> 00:36:53.186]  He won't do what I say.
[00:36:53.886 --> 00:36:55.608]  So, on Warped Speed, you're totally right.
[00:36:56.348 --> 00:37:01.673]  All the time, Roger Stone pulls his hair out because Trump will be told by people, this is a good person who will endorse a bad person.
[00:37:02.294 --> 00:37:03.255]  Because it's complex.
[00:37:03.295 --> 00:37:04.055]  I mean, I do this.
[00:37:05.253 --> 00:37:07.635]  I mean, I work 15, 16 hours a day.
[00:37:07.675 --> 00:37:10.158]  I spend a couple hours with my children, and I love telling my children.
[00:37:10.478 --> 00:37:12.840]  But I'm trying to know all this constantly, and I'm 50.
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:15.683]  This is all I do, and I miss a lot of stuff.
[00:37:16.303 --> 00:37:16.584]  Okay?
[00:37:17.505 --> 00:37:19.446]  And so, imagine being the president.
[00:37:19.486 --> 00:37:20.948]  I've got, you know, 50-something employees.
[00:37:20.988 --> 00:37:28.935]  If they all weren't on my team, putting up with me, and kicking ass, and just really focusing on my vision, we couldn't do any of this.
[00:37:29.824 --> 00:37:32.907]  Well, imagine having hundreds of thousands of people under you.
[00:37:33.247 --> 00:37:37.892]  And so even if they all want to pull in one direction, the government's full of all this scum.
[00:37:38.333 --> 00:37:39.774]  Now let's take Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:37:39.814 --> 00:37:41.055]  He reportedly wants to come on the show now.
[00:37:41.115 --> 00:37:41.516]  That's great.
[00:37:41.556 --> 00:37:41.856]  Come on.
[00:37:43.258 --> 00:37:46.060]  Great on vaccines, great on the CIA, great on the New World Order.
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.742]  He's a very well-spoken guy.
[00:37:47.762 --> 00:37:49.444]  They killed his father, they killed his uncle.
[00:37:49.484 --> 00:37:50.445]  You'd think he's on our side.
[00:37:51.271 --> 00:37:55.031]   But then he wants to arrest people that criticize climate change.
[00:37:55.031 --> 00:38:00.431]   And, you know, he's been for gun control and late term abortion in the past.
[00:38:00.431 --> 00:38:02.751]  So I like him as a person.
[00:38:02.751 --> 00:38:03.789]  I don't judge him.
[00:38:03.789 --> 00:38:05.870]  I just see Trump as way better.
[00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:08.150]  And I see RFK Jr.
[00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:10.431]  pulling more from Trump than Biden.
[00:38:10.431 --> 00:38:13.110]  And I think RFK Jr.
[00:38:13.029 --> 00:38:13.370]  Jr.
[00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:16.552]  wants on the show now because he knows he's not getting the attention.
[00:38:16.592 --> 00:38:17.673]  He wants that controversy.
[00:38:17.713 --> 00:38:17.933]  Great.
[00:38:17.973 --> 00:38:18.573]  Come on the show.
[00:38:18.854 --> 00:38:19.854]  But I'll be honest about that.
[00:38:19.914 --> 00:38:21.355]  Now, would R.K.
[00:38:21.395 --> 00:38:21.776]  Jr.
[00:38:21.836 --> 00:38:25.458]  be way better than Biden a trillion times?
[00:38:25.919 --> 00:38:27.500]  And maybe he'd prove himself.
[00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:31.203]  And maybe if he got elected president, he'd be better than Trump.
[00:38:31.363 --> 00:38:32.324]  But that's not going to happen.
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:43.747]  So he doesn't really count in the equation, so I've got Trump or Biden, and I can't morally, even though I have to hold my nose, and I've told Trump, I don't sit there and talk to Trump and kiss his ass.
[00:38:44.108 --> 00:38:45.989]  Literally, I've told Trump, hey, will you stop telling me how great I am?
[00:38:46.009 --> 00:38:47.010]  That's what he does to his buddies.
[00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:49.612]  Will you get rid of these people in your administration?
[00:38:49.632 --> 00:38:50.232]  Will you do this?
[00:38:50.252 --> 00:38:51.453]  Will you do that?
[00:38:51.473 --> 00:38:54.235]  Alex, come on now, okay, well, just a moment, just a moment.
[00:38:54.575 --> 00:38:55.135]  And I'll say, hey!
[00:38:56.058 --> 00:38:57.920]  You got the CIA and your administration to bring you down.
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:38:59.060]  Of course, it all came out.
[00:38:59.121 --> 00:39:00.301]  That's why they're all listening.
[00:39:00.582 --> 00:39:02.083]  When I'm on the phone with him, you saw headlines.
[00:39:02.323 --> 00:39:05.526]  The number one mission, Washington Post, is to keep Alex Jones away from Trump.
[00:39:06.046 --> 00:39:09.349]  Because I was having law firms write memos to him.
[00:39:09.749 --> 00:39:10.910]  I was advising him.
[00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:12.151]  I was doing that.
[00:39:12.251 --> 00:39:15.674]  That's when they came after me, not just what I do on air, but I did behind the scenes.
[00:39:15.694 --> 00:39:16.895]  So that's how real Trump is.
[00:39:16.915 --> 00:39:17.755]  He would listen to it.
[00:39:18.056 --> 00:39:18.916]  He'd say, send me that.
[00:39:19.437 --> 00:39:20.237]  And I'd send it to him.
[00:39:20.278 --> 00:39:21.058]  He would act on it.
[00:39:21.498 --> 00:39:23.200]  So I know he's for real.
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:24.461]  He would write executive orders.
[00:39:24.481 --> 00:39:25.342]  They throw them in the trash can.
[00:39:26.002 --> 00:39:35.208]  So, would you have somebody that means well, and overall is a good guy, who the system hates, or a Crypt Keeper dementia patient?
[00:39:35.228 --> 00:39:41.112]  So, I get your issues about Trump, but would you rather have, I mean, I don't think we're going to get Kennedy.
[00:39:41.132 --> 00:39:42.052]  I don't think there's any way.
[00:39:42.072 --> 00:39:45.615]  I think Kennedy basically delivers it to Biden.
[00:39:45.695 --> 00:39:52.441]   So, yeah, you could, in a purist, I mean, if I had to roll the dice, I'd probably go, okay, put Kennedy in, let's see what he does.
[00:39:53.041 --> 00:39:55.563]  Because, you know, you killed my dad, I don't think you can buy me off.
[00:39:55.823 --> 00:39:58.644]  I think, you know, I mean, yeah, okay, I think Kennedy's for real.
[00:39:59.144 --> 00:40:03.806]  But he kind of comes out of that leftist thing, you kind of can't help where the apple fell from the tree.
[00:40:04.507 --> 00:40:08.549]  Still, though, liberals used to be better in many ways, not this modern corporate blackrock version.
[00:40:08.989 --> 00:40:10.750]  So, yeah, it's a toying cost.
[00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:17.113]  If I could pick Trump or Biden, I don't, Trump or RFK Jr., I would maybe flip a coin.
[00:40:17.873 --> 00:40:20.075]  But he doesn't do that, he's not going to win.
[00:40:20.095 --> 00:40:20.655]  Does that make sense?
[00:40:23.057 --> 00:40:23.917]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:40:23.937 --> 00:40:24.718]  I agree with you.
[00:40:24.738 --> 00:40:25.919]  I agree with everything you said.
[00:40:26.559 --> 00:40:29.301]  The question is, is RFK a viable candidate?
[00:40:29.501 --> 00:40:30.662]  Can he get up there and get the votes?
[00:40:31.422 --> 00:40:31.783]  I don't know.
[00:40:31.843 --> 00:40:32.663]  I kind of doubt that.
[00:40:32.823 --> 00:40:34.825]  And then it comes down to Trump or Biden.
[00:40:34.865 --> 00:40:37.246]  And obviously Trump's the obvious choice, you know.
[00:40:37.787 --> 00:40:41.672]   It's just, other things you know as far as trump didn't pardon his saints
[00:40:41.672 --> 00:40:46.592]   he didn't pardon edward snowden you know the issues with his administration and regulatory
[00:40:46.592 --> 00:40:53.641]   capture um he talks a good game but when it came down to when the rubber met the road he
[00:40:53.641 --> 00:40:58.072]   really didn't pull through he didn't drain the swell that's because they distracted him they cut out
[00:40:58.072 --> 00:41:02.873]   his best people bannon and flynn and then kept him destabilized
[00:41:03.095 --> 00:41:09.176]  But that's why they're so scared now, because he will be not perfect, but 90% better than he was before.
[00:41:09.616 --> 00:41:10.376]  That's why they're so scared.
[00:41:10.396 --> 00:41:11.497]  Thank you so much.
[00:41:12.277 --> 00:41:14.337]  And I can make jokes all day about RFK Jr.
[00:41:14.377 --> 00:41:18.698]  and the brain worm that ate part of his brain, but at least he has a brain.
[00:41:18.718 --> 00:41:22.739]  Oh my goodness.
[00:41:23.019 --> 00:41:24.840]  Chase, who's up next?
[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:26.800]  Let's go next to Chaz.
[00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:27.861]  Chaz, you've been waiting patiently.
[00:41:27.881 --> 00:41:29.561]  Go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you have to say, sir.
[00:41:33.379 --> 00:41:35.661]  Go ahead, Chaz, are you there?
[00:41:35.741 --> 00:41:37.143]  Hey, is this working right now?
[00:41:37.383 --> 00:41:38.424]  Yeah, it's just a little echoey.
[00:41:38.704 --> 00:41:39.985]  Go on.
[00:41:40.806 --> 00:41:43.148]  Alright, uh, I'm sorry.
[00:41:43.208 --> 00:41:46.031]  Hold on, we'll put you on hold.
[00:41:46.371 --> 00:41:47.492]  We're not going to send out bad audio.
[00:41:47.512 --> 00:41:49.034]  We want to talk to you, but you've got your speakers on.
[00:41:49.074 --> 00:41:49.654]  It's not going to work.
[00:41:50.135 --> 00:41:50.795]  Let me just say this.
[00:41:51.969 --> 00:41:53.971]  I've been up since 4 a.m.
[00:41:53.991 --> 00:41:54.551]  today.
[00:41:54.591 --> 00:42:11.925]  I went to bed at midnight last night, I slept four hours, and normally at 746 I'm at home in the pool with my, you know, two daughters that still live with me and my wife, or we're inside watching, you know, a show or listening to music or doing art or, you know, literally reading books, the Bible, you name it, okay?
[00:42:11.965 --> 00:42:18.210]  My seven-year-old reads at like a college freshman level, and so she sits back and reads us books every night.
[00:42:19.151 --> 00:42:21.812]  I would be there right now and be ready, you know, go to bed three or four hours.
[00:42:21.832 --> 00:42:26.915]  I am on the edge of my seat about this in 13 minutes.
[00:42:27.595 --> 00:42:29.556]  I am on the edge of my seat.
[00:42:29.676 --> 00:42:42.692]   I hope that instead of folks tuning into the CNN, God knows what they'll do, we're going to have the live CNN feed here on SpacesX with, you know, Audio and at Real Alex Jones.
[00:42:42.932 --> 00:42:49.334]  And if they cut the feed there, we're at InfoWars.com forward slash show and the live show feed at Mandot Video.
[00:42:49.374 --> 00:42:52.876]  So both the feeds are on the front page of InfoWars.com.
[00:42:53.176 --> 00:43:01.119]  So for any reason CNN files some fake takedown and they kill our feed coming up with us, you can go to InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:43:02.392 --> 00:43:11.181]  And you can find it right there on the front page, both the X feed and our feed at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:43:12.102 --> 00:43:13.744]  So I don't want to just have the X feed up there.
[00:43:13.764 --> 00:43:15.165]  I want to have our feed up there under it.
[00:43:15.225 --> 00:43:18.249]  And we've got that so people can find it because this is a big deal.
[00:43:18.289 --> 00:43:18.909]  Watch the Trump.
[00:43:19.698 --> 00:43:25.658]   Biden debate here with commentary and analysis from Alex Jones a special guest and now let's see if that fella
[00:43:25.658 --> 00:43:31.258]   That feller has fixed his audio. Well, we we lost him. So we're gonna have to move on to another speaker
[00:43:31.258 --> 00:43:35.578]   Let's go to Robert the builder for now Robert go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you got to say, sir
[00:43:35.578 --> 00:43:39.818]   Good afternoon. Thank you gentlemen. Thank you Alex and Chase
[00:43:39.818 --> 00:43:47.258]   Welcome. Yes, I think I think Concerning the debate. I think it's really CNN versus Trump
[00:43:47.258 --> 00:43:51.326]   and I I like to talk about tactics.
[00:43:51.586 --> 00:43:54.689]  It seems like to me what I've seen, because I like to analyze things.
[00:43:57.037 --> 00:44:09.146]  Yeah, sometimes you have to, you can't say, you know, I think you're just a great person all the time, so I'm like, yeah, I try to look at what I'm doing wrong and stuff, but I think on the right, some of the problem we have is we telegraph our tactics.
[00:44:09.186 --> 00:44:11.928]  We're like an open book, and the left isn't.
[00:44:12.028 --> 00:44:20.755]  They're very secretive, and just like we didn't know that they were going to use the mute, they start muting it, you know, all these little tricks that are coming out at the end.
[00:44:21.255 --> 00:44:22.076]  We didn't know about.
[00:44:22.316 --> 00:44:23.817]  They're going to mute people.
[00:44:23.837 --> 00:44:24.858]  They're going to mute the press.
[00:44:24.878 --> 00:44:26.259]  Excuse me, I get nervous sometimes.
[00:44:26.599 --> 00:44:31.682]  They're going to mute the President and Biden or whatever.
[00:44:31.722 --> 00:44:33.543]  I call Trump the President and Biden whatever.
[00:44:33.664 --> 00:44:39.868]  Yes sir, we're going to go back to you in a moment, but we're only nine or ten minutes away from the debate that you will see right here.
[00:44:39.928 --> 00:44:40.388]  Stay with us.
[00:44:40.408 --> 00:44:41.289]  Share the link right now.
[00:44:41.309 --> 00:44:42.650]  It's a revolutionary act.
[00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:47.413]  You've got the power to overpower AI, but Roger Stone is in West Virginia on the Tim Pool Show.
[00:44:47.993 --> 00:44:51.137]  He has ducked out to join us to give us a quick snapshot.
[00:44:51.558 --> 00:44:55.502]  He'll be joining us right after the debate ends at 930 Central.
[00:44:55.803 --> 00:44:57.144]  So will Robert Barnes of Analysis.
[00:44:58.186 --> 00:45:01.069]  Roger, I don't think I've ever been on the edge of my seat like this.
[00:45:01.129 --> 00:45:02.351]  What are you expecting tonight?
[00:45:03.976 --> 00:45:05.597]  Well, Alex, I'm right there with you.
[00:45:05.697 --> 00:45:08.198]  I mean, I don't think we know exactly what to expect.
[00:45:08.238 --> 00:45:09.158]  Look, here's what I know.
[00:45:09.198 --> 00:45:10.879]  Donald Trump is a natural.
[00:45:11.179 --> 00:45:13.660]  He has not spent days cramming for this.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.662]  He doesn't do stage things with somebody playing Joe Biden in role play.
[00:45:18.802 --> 00:45:21.282]  That's not him. He knows what he wants to say.
[00:45:21.282 --> 00:45:28.161]   We've seen him vanquish 16 far more experienced politicians for the 2016 nomination.
[00:45:28.161 --> 00:45:31.481]  I say he stayed sharp by doing these town halls.
[00:45:31.481 --> 00:45:35.161]  Remember the way he decimated that woman, Caitlin Collins?
[00:45:35.161 --> 00:45:36.762]  I think she's a woman anyway.
[00:45:37.534 --> 00:45:40.136]  He decimated her in that New Hampshire town hall.
[00:45:40.276 --> 00:45:41.196]  It was brutal.
[00:45:41.476 --> 00:45:43.938]  And she tried to challenge him and he took her apart.
[00:45:44.058 --> 00:45:45.558]  So I think he's ready.
[00:45:45.618 --> 00:45:47.399]  I spoke to him about an hour and a half ago.
[00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:49.441]  Guy is cool as a cucumber.
[00:45:49.461 --> 00:45:56.044]  I mean, it's just amazing the way he handles stress, the way he handles this, this high pressure atmosphere.
[00:45:56.084 --> 00:45:57.705]  So I'm optimistic.
[00:45:57.825 --> 00:46:05.353]   Now, I've got to tell you, Alex, in the 45 years I've been in American politics, I've never known a worse piece of crap than Jake Tapper.
[00:46:05.393 --> 00:46:08.235]  He literally is the lowest life form known to man.
[00:46:08.255 --> 00:46:11.978]  This is a guy who laughed online when he thought I was going to prison.
[00:46:12.218 --> 00:46:12.918]  Here's the good news.
[00:46:13.078 --> 00:46:14.259]  I'm still here and I'm free.
[00:46:14.619 --> 00:46:17.942]  And he's in a failing network that is only being seen in airports.
[00:46:17.982 --> 00:46:18.482]  That's right.
[00:46:18.522 --> 00:46:19.823]  So you just talked to Trump.
[00:46:19.883 --> 00:46:21.504]  Talk more about how the big guy's doing.
[00:46:22.717 --> 00:46:28.962]  Well, I mean, look, I don't want to get into too many specifics, but I just called to wish him good luck and he said... Oh, I bet you gave him some advice.
[00:46:30.163 --> 00:46:32.104]  Well, if I did, I wouldn't say it here.
[00:46:32.745 --> 00:46:38.249]  Look, I'm just amazed at the way he compartmentalizes stress.
[00:46:38.289 --> 00:46:41.211]  This guy, you know, he's going to a high pressure atmosphere.
[00:46:41.552 --> 00:46:46.175]  This debate could completely and totally change the entire presidential race.
[00:46:47.036 --> 00:46:48.998]  And he just acts like it's another day.
[00:46:49.198 --> 00:46:50.599]  So I'm feeling pretty good.
[00:46:51.541 --> 00:46:58.766]  I thought in the beginning it was, you know, three on one, because you had Dana Bash, then you had Jake Tapper, and you got Joe Biden.
[00:46:58.807 --> 00:47:05.031]  But then I thought about it, it's really only two and a half on one, because Joe's not all there.
[00:47:06.952 --> 00:47:08.734]  But he is walking into a trap.
[00:47:08.774 --> 00:47:10.375]  Why do you think they're putting a big delay on it?
[00:47:10.855 --> 00:47:12.436]  Why do you think they've got mute buttons?
[00:47:12.496 --> 00:47:14.558]  I mean, that shows Biden's gonna be sitting down.
[00:47:17.188 --> 00:47:24.054]  Yeah, I mean, look, I think they're doing all that stuff because they know the guy that they've got to try to get across here is feeble.
[00:47:24.194 --> 00:47:25.795]  I mean, he can't take it.
[00:47:25.855 --> 00:47:28.257]  So they have to push Trump back.
[00:47:28.297 --> 00:47:31.120]  They're going to prop Joe up, which may be impossible.
[00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:40.107]  There is a strategy, and I'm not sure I disagree with this, of just letting Joe talk because he will fall back on fake stories that never really happened.
[00:47:40.708 --> 00:47:45.211]   Like the other day when he said, you know, when I came in, Inflation was 9%, now it's 1.4.
[00:47:45.351 --> 00:47:47.713]  No, it's the other way around, dummy.
[00:47:48.013 --> 00:47:51.096]  When Trump left, inflation was 1.4.
[00:47:51.276 --> 00:47:52.217]  It's at 9% today.
[00:47:52.757 --> 00:47:54.458]  This guy doesn't know which day of the week it is.
[00:47:54.498 --> 00:47:55.019]  Let me ask you this.
[00:47:55.119 --> 00:47:56.440]  Why do you think Biden agreed?
[00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:57.821]  I think it's total desperation.
[00:47:57.841 --> 00:48:03.025]  They're even admitting he's auditioning to not be removed at the DNC in Chicago.
[00:48:04.472 --> 00:48:06.413]  Actually, here's what I think the strategy was.
[00:48:07.014 --> 00:48:08.255]  They don't want Joe to debate.
[00:48:08.735 --> 00:48:18.702]  So they figured they would challenge Trump in a debate that he would never, ever, under any circumstance, agree to, because it's a hostile network, it's a controlled situation.
[00:48:19.042 --> 00:48:24.706]  That would allow them to say, for the rest of this campaign, look, we gave Trump his chance to debate and he wouldn't do it.
[00:48:25.066 --> 00:48:29.589]  He said anytime, anyplace, but then when we offered to do the CNN debate, he wouldn't do it.
[00:48:30.189 --> 00:48:33.330]  So I think Trump surprised them by agreeing.
[00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:35.231]  And the guy's a total brawler.
[00:48:35.291 --> 00:48:36.331]  I mean, he's fearless.
[00:48:36.371 --> 00:48:41.453]  So the rigged situation doesn't seem to bother him in the slightest.
[00:48:41.873 --> 00:48:43.534]  I think he called their bluff.
[00:48:43.834 --> 00:48:45.195]  They didn't really want this debate.
[00:48:45.495 --> 00:48:47.515]  They were certain he was going to turn this debate down.
[00:48:47.795 --> 00:48:49.136]  And of course, he didn't do that.
[00:48:49.436 --> 00:48:51.117]  Well, as usual, you're right on target.
[00:48:51.157 --> 00:48:56.118]  You said three years ago they would replace him at the DNC long before they announced Chicago.
[00:48:56.158 --> 00:48:57.439]  Now they're saying they're planning to do it.
[00:48:59.941 --> 00:49:02.303]  Yeah, I stick to my prediction, by the way.
[00:49:02.623 --> 00:49:03.884]  Just a small correction.
[00:49:04.545 --> 00:49:10.249]  I'm with our good friend Luke Rutkowski doing his show tonight rather than with Tim Pool, another good man.
[00:49:10.609 --> 00:49:15.413]  I got a pending invitation from Tim, but Luke sends his best regards.
[00:49:15.533 --> 00:49:15.973]  Absolutely.
[00:49:16.013 --> 00:49:16.774]  Luke's a co-host.
[00:49:16.794 --> 00:49:19.576]  They told me you're with Tim Pool, so the crew told me that, but they're great, too.
[00:49:19.876 --> 00:49:20.777]  It doesn't matter where you are.
[00:49:20.817 --> 00:49:22.678]  The point is, so where are you physically?
[00:49:22.698 --> 00:49:23.078]  In Florida?
[00:49:23.939 --> 00:49:24.920]  I'm in South Florida.
[00:49:26.883 --> 00:49:28.585]  How'd you tune into the InfoWars?
[00:49:28.625 --> 00:49:32.791]  Come on, it's, uh, because we are, in case you didn't know this, we're the tip of the spear.
[00:49:33.091 --> 00:49:35.555]  Well, join us after the debate tonight, okay?
[00:49:35.575 --> 00:49:36.316]  And bring Luke with you.
[00:49:37.377 --> 00:49:38.659]  All right, we will swing back in.
[00:49:38.799 --> 00:49:39.880]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:40.381]  60 seconds.
[00:49:40.782 --> 00:49:41.783]  StoneZone.com.
[00:49:41.843 --> 00:49:44.587]  What else do you want to say about what we're about to see in five minutes?
[00:49:45.911 --> 00:49:49.093]  This is as historic as the Nixon-Kennedy debate.
[00:49:49.393 --> 00:49:51.875]  This is as historic as the Reagan-Carter debate.
[00:49:52.195 --> 00:49:57.838]  What we see tonight could change the entire course of American, and therefore, world history.
[00:49:58.199 --> 00:50:00.520]  So, like you, Alex, I'm on the edge of my seat.
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:04.082]  Anybody who tells you they know exactly what's going to happen tonight is full of crap.
[00:50:04.122 --> 00:50:08.805]  We won't know until it actually happens, but my money is on Donald J. Trump.
[00:50:09.065 --> 00:50:11.466]  All right, Roger, join us 30 minutes after it ends.
[00:50:11.526 --> 00:50:13.527]  I'll be with Stephen Crowder as well tonight.
[00:50:13.867 --> 00:50:14.807]  More space is coming up.
[00:50:14.847 --> 00:50:15.628]  Thank you, Roger Stone.
[00:50:16.628 --> 00:50:17.128]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:50:17.148 --> 00:50:21.590]  All right, they always start these about three to five minutes late, but we got exactly five minutes till it starts.
[00:50:22.110 --> 00:50:29.373]  Here's a quick little clip of myself a week and a half ago in Detroit, and we'll come right back with live coverage and a live stream of the debate.
[00:50:29.452 --> 00:50:31.452]  Stay with us and share the links now.
[00:50:31.452 --> 00:50:54.452]  [Music]
[00:50:54.452 --> 00:51:08.452]  The answer to 1984 is 1776! 1776! 1776! 1776!
[00:51:08.452 --> 00:51:13.452]   So this fight for America is key, not just for us, but the entire world.
[00:51:14.209 --> 00:51:25.297]   Because if this republic falls, the entire world falls to the UN and the globalists and their hellish plan to literally take everything you We've got news for them.
[00:51:25.137 --> 00:51:30.137]   away from you. And whether it's Klaus Schwab or Bill Gates or Yuval Noah Harari,
[00:51:30.137 --> 00:51:36.137]   they represent the globalist ruling class of the planet who say the future
[00:51:36.137 --> 00:51:42.137]   is not human. Well we got news for them. The future is not globalist!
[00:51:42.137 --> 00:51:48.137]  [Cheers]
[00:51:48.137 --> 00:51:51.137]  The future is human.
[00:51:51.283 --> 00:51:57.106]  The lies they spread about Alex, they've tried to take him out more than they've tried to take any of us out.
[00:51:57.666 --> 00:51:58.727]  But let me tell you what it is.
[00:51:58.787 --> 00:52:11.693]  What they'll never say is that Alex Jones has spent 30 years being the loudest voice for freedom, for liberty, and for anti-war that this world has seen.
[00:52:11.993 --> 00:52:15.655]  He stood against them, and that's why they're against him.
[00:52:16.883 --> 00:52:23.547]  Well, they have tried to burn him to the ground, but he won't stop fighting!
[00:52:24.188 --> 00:52:25.869]  Let's launch Team Humanity!
[00:52:28.871 --> 00:52:30.212]  Team Humanity!
[00:52:33.394 --> 00:52:34.595]  Team Humanity!
[00:52:38.177 --> 00:52:40.539]  Are you gonna let them brainwash and take your children?
[00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:52.788]  The answer to their 1984 anti-human, dehumanization world is humanity coming together and celebrating freedom that God gave us and saying no!
[00:52:52.968 --> 00:52:57.852]  The answer to 1984 is 1776!
[00:53:00.594 --> 00:53:02.015]  So I have a message to the globalists.
[00:53:02.736 --> 00:53:08.921]  I don't know how all this is going to end, but if you want to fight, you better believe you've got one!
[00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:14.261]  They declared war on us!
[00:53:15.638 --> 00:53:16.658]  They're attacking us.
[00:53:17.019 --> 00:53:18.059]  They're surveilling us.
[00:53:18.399 --> 00:53:19.420]  They're censoring us.
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:23.461]  They're cutting off our energy, our water, our communications, our freedom.
[00:53:23.761 --> 00:53:28.223]  We're simply recognizing it and saying, we're not going to roll over and die.
[00:53:28.643 --> 00:53:31.344]  Our God is the God of the universe that created it all.
[00:53:31.584 --> 00:53:34.606]  And your little God, Satan, is a loser!
[00:53:34.626 --> 00:53:39.908]  There is a global, worldwide, political realignment against the New World Order.
[00:53:40.108 --> 00:53:50.254]   The New World Order is a couple thousand arrogant people People led by King Charles, who sits around and talks about how he wants to depopulate people, and so did his father, Prince Philip.
[00:53:50.274 --> 00:53:56.378]  And I'm telling them right now, we are not rolling over and dying for you inbred globalists!
[00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:03.179]  He will not divide and conquer us any longer.
[00:54:03.179 --> 00:54:07.019]  And as long as we never give up, we are invincible.
[00:54:07.019 --> 00:54:26.220]  [Music]
[00:54:26.057 --> 00:54:29.057]  [Music]
[00:54:29.057 --> 00:54:35.057]  [Music]
[00:54:35.057 --> 00:54:41.057]  [Music]
[00:54:41.057 --> 00:54:48.057]  [Music]
[00:54:48.057 --> 00:54:51.057]  [Music]
[00:54:54.057 --> 00:54:57.057]  [Music]
[00:54:57.057 --> 00:55:02.057]  [Music]
[00:55:02.057 --> 00:55:11.057]   While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:55:11.719 --> 00:55:15.938]   Visit info wars.com forward slash show and share the link today
[00:55:15.938 --> 00:55:42.577]   Well the CIA is working overtime To an info wars dot com front line report
[00:55:42.577 --> 00:55:47.577]   If you are receiving this transmission You are the resistance
[00:55:47.577 --> 00:55:48.898]  (upbeat music)
[00:55:49.041 --> 00:55:51.161]  Well, it's 8 central and 20 seconds.
[00:55:51.402 --> 00:55:54.762]  And as I predicted, they're going to probably start the debate about five minutes late.
[00:55:54.842 --> 00:56:05.125]  Let's go ahead and pump the Communist News Network feed in and see what these enemies of the people are talking about as Trump marches into a trap and a lion's den.
[00:56:05.165 --> 00:56:05.545]  Here it is.
[00:56:07.005 --> 00:56:08.226]  A race for the White House.
[00:56:08.346 --> 00:56:10.166]  In just moments, the current U.S.
[00:56:10.226 --> 00:56:12.828]  President will debate the former U.S.
[00:56:12.868 --> 00:56:18.430]  President as their party's presumptive nominees, a first in American history.
[00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:24.313]  We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world to our studios in Atlanta.
[00:56:24.793 --> 00:56:27.434]  This is the CNN Presidential Debate.
[00:56:28.607 --> 00:56:36.954]  This debate is being produced by CNN and is coming to you live on CNN, CNN International, CNN.com, CNN Max.
[00:56:37.154 --> 00:56:39.516]  Yeah, it must be nice for them to actually have viewers again.
[00:56:39.536 --> 00:56:42.099]  This is going to have probably more viewers than the Super Bowl.
[00:56:42.879 --> 00:56:49.345]  Let's go back to these two kleptocrats, these two teleprompter raiders who have this lion marching into their den of hyenas.
[00:56:49.365 --> 00:56:49.865]  Go back to them.
[00:56:49.885 --> 00:56:53.228]  Four months until election day.
[00:56:54.249 --> 00:56:59.591]  Good evening, I'm Dana Bash, anchor of CNN's Inside Politics and co-anchor of State of the Union.
[00:56:59.831 --> 00:57:03.552]  I'm Jake Tapper, anchor of CNN's The Lead and co-anchor of State of the Union.
[00:57:03.952 --> 00:57:06.153]  Dana and I will co-moderate this evening.
[00:57:06.213 --> 00:57:11.194]  Our job is to facilitate a debate between the two candidates tonight.
[00:57:11.655 --> 00:57:15.456]  Before we introduce them, we want to share the rules of the debate with the audience at home.
[00:57:15.996 --> 00:57:18.659]  Former President Trump will be on the left side of the screen.
[00:57:18.979 --> 00:57:21.121]  President Biden will be appearing on the right.
[00:57:21.261 --> 00:57:23.764]  A coin toss determines their positions.
[00:57:24.385 --> 00:57:30.591]  Each candidate will have two minutes to answer a question and one minute each for responses and rebuttals.
[00:57:31.111 --> 00:57:36.537]  An additional minute for follow-up clarification or response is at the moderator's discretion.
[00:57:37.401 --> 00:57:44.323]  When it's time for a candidate to speak, his microphone will be turned on, and his opponent's microphone will be turned off.
[00:57:45.003 --> 00:57:51.244]  Should a candidate interrupt when his microphone is muted, he will be difficult to understand for viewers at home.
[00:57:52.084 --> 00:57:56.085]  At the end of the debate, each candidate will get two minutes for closing statements.
[00:57:56.585 --> 00:57:58.546]  There is no studio audience tonight.
[00:57:59.026 --> 00:58:04.087]  Pre-written notes, props, or contact with campaign staff are not permitted during the debate.
[00:58:04.747 --> 00:58:11.411]  By accepting our invitation to debate, both candidates and their campaigns agreed to accept these rules.
[00:58:12.111 --> 00:58:16.173]  Now, please welcome the 46th President of the United States, Joe Biden.
[00:58:16.233 --> 00:58:17.494]  Who stole the election!
[00:58:18.434 --> 00:58:19.034]  Folks, how are you?
[00:58:19.815 --> 00:58:20.755]  Folks, how are you?
[00:58:21.596 --> 00:58:22.356]  Like, where do I go?
[00:58:22.376 --> 00:58:23.037]  I don't even know.
[00:58:24.317 --> 00:58:26.779]  He's jacked up on probably 10 Adderalls right now.
[00:58:28.439 --> 00:58:29.220]  Look at that joke!
[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:33.202]  Please welcome the 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump.
[00:58:36.457 --> 00:58:38.604]  Notice you can hear Biden say, thank you, thank you.
[00:58:38.644 --> 00:58:40.169]  His mic, Trump's mic's turned off.
[00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.852]  Notice the key.
[00:58:41.293 --> 00:58:42.537]  Biden walks out, his mic's turned on.
[00:58:44.641 --> 00:58:46.122]  Gentlemen, thanks so much for being here.
[00:58:46.162 --> 00:58:53.004]  Let's begin the debate, and let's start with the issue that voters consistently say is their top concern, the economy.
[00:58:53.544 --> 00:58:57.605]  President Biden, inflation has slowed, but prices remain high.
[00:58:58.126 --> 00:59:01.107]  Since you took office, the price of essentials has increased.
[00:59:01.547 --> 00:59:06.308]  For example, a basket of groceries that cost $100 then now costs more than $120.
[00:59:06.428 --> 00:59:10.070]  And typical home prices have jumped more than 30%.
[00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:16.853]  What do you say to voters who feel they are worse off under your presidency than they were under President Trump?
[00:59:17.233 --> 00:59:19.715]  We gotta take a look at what I was left when I became president.
[00:59:20.335 --> 00:59:21.596]  What Mr. Trump left me.
[00:59:22.176 --> 00:59:23.957]  We had an economy that was in freefall.
[00:59:24.438 --> 00:59:26.259]  The pandemic was so badly handled.
[00:59:26.879 --> 00:59:27.880]  Many people were dying.
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:29.621]  All he said was it's not that serious.
[00:59:30.121 --> 00:59:32.923]  I guarantee you Biden has had the Lance Armstrong treatment.
[00:59:35.067 --> 00:59:42.067]   jobs. Unemployment rate rose to 15%. It was terrible. So what we had to do was put things
[00:59:42.067 --> 00:59:47.067]   back together again. We created 15,000 new jobs. We created 15,000 new jobs. We created
[00:59:47.067 --> 00:59:53.626]   10,000 new jobs. We created 100,000 new jobs. But there's more to be done. There's more
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:56.400]  Who's got five bags of 10-year-old blood?
[00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:57.900]  I come from Scranton, Pennsylvania.
[00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:01.920]   I come from a household where the kitchen table, if things weren't able to be met during
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:02.918]  the month, it was a problem.
[01:00:02.918 --> 01:00:07.119]   The price of eggs, the price of gas, the price of housing, the price of a whole range of
[01:00:07.119 --> 01:00:08.119]  things.
[01:00:08.119 --> 01:00:11.680]   That's why I'm working so hard to make sure I deal with those problems.
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:14.759]  And we're going to make sure we reduce the price of housing.
[01:00:14.759 --> 01:00:17.400]  We're going to make sure we build 2 million new units.
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:20.960]   We're going to make sure we cap rents so corporate greed can't take over.
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:21.960]  I'm bringing 50 million illegals.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:25.360]   What I was left with in corporate greed is the reason why we're in this problem right
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:26.360]  now.
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:30.000]   In addition to that, we're in a situation where if you had to take a look at all that
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.400]  was done in his administration.
[01:00:32.057 --> 01:00:33.478]  He didn't do much at all.
[01:00:33.879 --> 01:00:35.981]  By the time he left, things were in chaos.
[01:00:36.741 --> 01:00:37.602]  Literally chaos.
[01:00:38.183 --> 01:00:41.606]  And so we put things back together, we created, I said... Oh, you put them together.
[01:00:41.626 --> 01:00:43.808]  When I win the election, immediately surge the border.
[01:00:44.328 --> 01:00:46.330]  We brought down the price of prescription drugs.
[01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:47.611]  Oh yeah, all the wars.
[01:00:49.913 --> 01:00:54.072]  for a insulin shot as opposed to $400.
[01:00:54.072 --> 01:01:00.952]   No senior has to pay more than $200 for any drug, all the drugs they conclude beginning next year.
[01:01:00.952 --> 01:01:04.152]   And the situation is making, and we're gonna make that available to everybody,
[01:01:04.152 --> 01:01:05.233]  to all Americans.
[01:01:05.233 --> 01:01:08.313]   So we're working to bring down the price of around the kitchen table,
[01:01:08.313 --> 01:01:10.393]  and that's what we're gonna get done.
[01:01:10.393 --> 01:01:12.032]  Thank you, President Trump.
[01:01:12.032 --> 01:01:14.992]  We're the greatest economy in the history of our country.
[01:01:15.565 --> 01:01:17.467]  We have never done so well.
[01:01:18.748 --> 01:01:20.410]  Everybody was amazed by it.
[01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:21.811]  Other countries were copying us.
[01:01:21.872 --> 01:01:23.593]  We got hit with COVID.
[01:01:24.414 --> 01:01:30.280]  And when we did, we spent the money necessary so we wouldn't end up in a Great Depression, the likes of which we had in 1929.
[01:01:31.921 --> 01:01:33.863]  By the time we finish, so we did a great job.
[01:01:33.883 --> 01:01:39.388]  We got a lot of credit for the economy, a lot of credit for the military, and no wars, and so many other things.
[01:01:39.569 --> 01:01:40.810]  Everything was rocking good.
[01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:45.794]  But the thing we never got the credit for, and we should have, is getting us out of that COVID mess.
[01:01:46.635 --> 01:01:56.440]   He created mandates that was a disaster for our country, but other than that, we had given them back a a country where the stock market actually was higher than
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:57.240]  pre-COVID.
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:59.441]  And nobody thought that was even possible.
[01:01:59.441 --> 01:02:03.881]   The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounce-back jobs,
[01:02:03.881 --> 01:02:05.481]  the bounce-back from the COVID.
[01:02:05.481 --> 01:02:07.881]  He has not done a good job. He's done a poor job.
[01:02:07.881 --> 01:02:11.481]   And inflation's killing our country. It is absolutely killing us.
[01:02:11.481 --> 01:02:13.481]  Thank you. President Biden?
[01:02:13.481 --> 01:02:15.481]  Well, look, the greatest economy in the world.
[01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:17.010]  He's the only one who thinks that, I think.
[01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:19.891]  I don't know anybody else who thinks he has the greatest economy in the world.
[01:02:20.571 --> 01:02:31.035]  And, you know, the fact of the matter is that we find ourselves in a situation where his economy... Went from the number three energy producer to number one overnight.
[01:02:31.075 --> 01:02:33.056]  ...American history, two trillion dollars.
[01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:36.377]  He raised a deficit larger than any president has in any one term.
[01:02:36.697 --> 01:02:37.077]  That's not true.
[01:02:37.097 --> 01:02:41.859]  He's the only president other than Herbert Hoover who's lost more jobs than he has... That's a total lie!
[01:02:41.899 --> 01:02:42.559]  ...since Herbert Hoover.
[01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:45.560]  The deficit's been the biggest ever under Biden.
[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:46.641]  ...and the military.
[01:02:47.141 --> 01:02:50.883]  You know, when he was president, they were still killing people in Afghanistan.
[01:02:51.323 --> 01:02:52.423]  He didn't do anything about that.
[01:02:52.683 --> 01:02:54.564]  He did the horrible withdrawal!
[01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:55.445]  Biden did that!
[01:02:56.045 --> 01:02:56.485]  Wow!
[01:02:56.845 --> 01:02:59.786]  ...a notion that we were this safe country.
[01:02:59.927 --> 01:03:00.887]  I'm so full of crap.
[01:03:01.287 --> 01:03:08.950]  I'm the only president this century that doesn't have any, this decade, that doesn't have any troops dying anywhere in the world.
[01:03:09.111 --> 01:03:09.311]  What?
[01:03:09.331 --> 01:03:09.851]  Like he did.
[01:03:11.139 --> 01:03:13.621]  President Trump, I want to follow up if I can.
[01:03:13.641 --> 01:03:15.062]  Am I allowed to respond to him?
[01:03:15.383 --> 01:03:16.343]  Well, I'm going to ask you a follow-up.
[01:03:16.363 --> 01:03:18.105]  You can do whatever you want with the minute that we give you.
[01:03:18.845 --> 01:03:19.566]  I want to follow up.
[01:03:19.806 --> 01:03:23.389]  You want to impose a 10% tariff on all goods coming into the U.S.
[01:03:23.970 --> 01:03:26.712]  How will you ensure that that doesn't drive prices even higher?
[01:03:26.752 --> 01:03:29.752]   Not going to drive them higher, it's just going to cost countries that have been ripping
[01:03:29.752 --> 01:03:34.112]   us off for years like China and many others in all fairness to China.
[01:03:34.112 --> 01:03:38.392]   It's going to just force them to pay us a lot of money, reduce our deficit tremendously.
[01:03:38.392 --> 01:03:39.392]  You see the cheating though?
[01:03:39.392 --> 01:03:40.392]  They didn't give him the follow up.
[01:03:40.392 --> 01:03:41.392]  See, they're doing it.
[01:03:41.392 --> 01:03:42.392]  He made a statement.
[01:03:42.392 --> 01:03:46.072]   The only thing he was right about is I gave you the largest tax cut in history.
[01:03:46.072 --> 01:03:48.712]  I also gave you the largest regulation cut in history.
[01:03:48.712 --> 01:03:50.332]  That's why we had all the jobs.
[01:03:50.332 --> 01:03:54.032]   And the jobs went down and then they bounced back and he's taking credit for bounce back
[01:03:54.032 --> 01:03:55.032]  jobs.
[01:03:55.032 --> 01:03:56.032]  You can't do that.
[01:03:56.032 --> 01:03:58.271]  He inherited nine percent inflation.
[01:03:58.271 --> 01:04:02.752]   Now he inherited almost no inflation and it stayed that way for 14 months.
[01:04:02.597 --> 01:04:07.457]   And then it blew up under his leadership because they spent money like a bunch of people that
[01:04:07.457 --> 01:04:09.877]   didn't know what they were doing and they don't know what they were doing.
[01:04:09.877 --> 01:04:13.217]   It was the worst, probably the worst administration in history.
[01:04:13.217 --> 01:04:14.217]  There's never been.
[01:04:14.217 --> 01:04:18.336]   And as far as Afghanistan is concerned, I was getting out of Afghanistan, but we're
[01:04:18.336 --> 01:04:22.377]  getting out with dignity, with strength, with power.
[01:04:22.377 --> 01:04:23.377]  He got out.
[01:04:23.377 --> 01:04:27.296]  It was the most embarrassing day in the history of his life.
[01:04:27.296 --> 01:04:31.417]   President Trump over the last eight years under both of your administrations, the national
[01:04:31.417 --> 01:04:33.097]  debt soared to record highs.
[01:04:33.422 --> 01:04:42.593]  And according to a new non-partisan analysis, President Trump, your administration approved $8.4 trillion in new debt, while so far, President Biden, you've approved $4.3 trillion in new debt.
[01:04:44.255 --> 01:04:49.337]  So, former President Trump, many of the tax cuts that you signed into law are set to expire next year.
[01:04:49.737 --> 01:04:52.077]  You want to extend them and go even further, you say.
[01:04:52.537 --> 01:04:53.258]  With the U.S.
[01:04:53.318 --> 01:05:01.120]  facing trillion-dollar deficits and record debt, why should top earners and corporations pay even less in taxes than they do now?
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:05.641]  Because the tax cuts spurred the greatest economy that we've ever seen, just prior to COVID.
[01:05:05.661 --> 01:05:06.042]  Just like Reagan.
[01:05:06.062 --> 01:05:06.762]  Right after COVID.
[01:05:06.842 --> 01:05:11.323]  It was so strong that we were able to get through COVID much better than just about any other country.
[01:05:11.764 --> 01:05:13.564]  But we spurred, that tax spurred.
[01:05:13.624 --> 01:05:19.186]  Now, when we cut the taxes, as an example, the corporate tax was cut down to 21% from 39%, plus beyond that.
[01:05:21.647 --> 01:05:21.987]  That's right.
[01:05:22.007 --> 01:05:22.288]  That's right.
[01:05:22.308 --> 01:05:22.848]  China had a 5% tax.
[01:05:22.668 --> 01:05:27.628]   more revenue with much less tax and companies were bringing back trillions of dollars back
[01:05:27.628 --> 01:05:28.948]  into our country.
[01:05:28.948 --> 01:05:33.907]   The country was going like never before and we were ready to start paying down debt.
[01:05:33.907 --> 01:05:37.988]   We're ready to start using the liquid gold right under our feet, the oil and gas right
[01:05:37.988 --> 01:05:38.988]  under our feet.
[01:05:38.988 --> 01:05:42.168]  If China had a 5% tax, we had a 30 plus.
[01:05:42.168 --> 01:05:43.307]  We got hit with COVID.
[01:05:43.590 --> 01:05:44.791]  We did a lot to fix it.
[01:05:44.831 --> 01:05:51.138]  I gave him an unbelievable situation with all of the therapeutics and all of the things that we came up with.
[01:05:51.899 --> 01:05:53.280]  We gave him something great.
[01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:56.564]  Remember, more people died under his administration.
[01:05:56.584 --> 01:05:57.645]  Trump isn't pushing the shot.
[01:05:57.665 --> 01:05:58.546]  He's pushing therapeutics.
[01:05:58.566 --> 01:05:58.906]  That's good.
[01:05:59.807 --> 01:06:04.790]  More people died under his administration than our administration, and we were right in the middle of it.
[01:06:05.070 --> 01:06:07.311]  Something which a lot of people don't like to talk about.
[01:06:07.651 --> 01:06:10.673]  But he had far more people dying in his administration.
[01:06:11.013 --> 01:06:15.335]  He did the mandate, which is a disaster, mandating- Biden is massively plumbed.
[01:06:15.555 --> 01:06:16.315]  Five maximums at least.
[01:06:16.355 --> 01:06:16.836]  Each budget.
[01:06:16.856 --> 01:06:17.376]  Bet your dollar.
[01:06:17.196 --> 01:06:20.196]  that people most objected to about the vaccine.
[01:06:20.196 --> 01:06:21.196]  He's blood dumping.
[01:06:21.196 --> 01:06:22.196]  Bet your dollar.
[01:06:22.196 --> 01:06:23.196]  Bet your dollar.
[01:06:23.196 --> 01:06:24.196]  Just a very poor job.
[01:06:24.196 --> 01:06:27.635]   And I will tell you, not only poor there, but throughout the entire world, we're no
[01:06:27.635 --> 01:06:29.635]  longer respected as a country.
[01:06:29.635 --> 01:06:31.316]  They don't respect our leadership.
[01:06:31.316 --> 01:06:33.676]  They don't respect the United States anymore.
[01:06:33.676 --> 01:06:39.316]   We're like a third world nation between weaponization of his election, trying to go after his political
[01:06:39.316 --> 01:06:40.316]  opponent.
[01:06:40.316 --> 01:06:43.875]   All of the things he's done, we've become like a third world nation.
[01:06:43.875 --> 01:06:44.636]  And it's a shame.
[01:06:45.030 --> 01:06:57.000]  The damage he's done to our country, and I'd love to ask him, and will, why he allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons, jails, and mental institutions to come into our country and destroy our country.
[01:06:57.621 --> 01:07:00.803]  President Trump, we will get to immigration later in this block.
[01:07:00.883 --> 01:07:04.987]  President Biden, I want to give you an opportunity to respond to this question about the national debt.
[01:07:05.808 --> 01:07:09.152]  He had the largest national debt of any president in a four year period, number one.
[01:07:09.813 --> 01:07:14.218]  Number two, he got a two trillion dollar tax cut and benefited the very wealthy.
[01:07:15.319 --> 01:07:16.781]  What I'm going to do is fix the tax system.
[01:07:16.821 --> 01:07:19.865]  For example, we have a thousand trillionaires in America.
[01:07:20.546 --> 01:07:21.607]  I mean billionaires in America.
[01:07:23.228 --> 01:07:27.232]  They're in a situation where they in fact pay 8.2 percent in taxes.
[01:07:27.712 --> 01:07:36.900]  If they just paid 24 percent, 25 percent, either one of those numbers, they've raised 500 million dollars, billion dollars I should say, in a 10 year period.
[01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:41.984]  We'd be able to wipe out his debt, we'd be able to help make sure that all those... No, he's moved to another country.
[01:07:42.185 --> 01:07:42.465]  Childcare.
[01:07:42.505 --> 01:07:43.085]  Which is the plan.
[01:07:43.145 --> 01:07:43.646]  Eldercare.
[01:07:43.926 --> 01:07:47.169]  Making sure that we continue to strengthen our healthcare system.
[01:07:47.529 --> 01:07:48.169]  Thank you, President Biden.
[01:07:48.009 --> 01:07:53.847]   that we're able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I've been able to
[01:07:53.847 --> 01:07:54.847]  do with the COVID.
[01:07:54.847 --> 01:07:55.847]  Biden is falling apart.
[01:07:55.847 --> 01:07:58.608]  Excuse me, with 10 minutes in.
[01:07:58.608 --> 01:08:01.128]  Dealing with everything we have to do with.
[01:08:01.128 --> 01:08:02.367]  It's actually like eight minutes in.
[01:08:02.367 --> 01:08:05.048]  They started at five after.
[01:08:05.048 --> 01:08:06.048]  If we finally beat Medicare.
[01:08:06.048 --> 01:08:08.489]  Oh my God, he is disintegrating right now.
[01:08:08.489 --> 01:08:09.847]  Thank you, President Biden.
[01:08:09.847 --> 01:08:10.847]  President Trump?
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:12.741]  He did beat Medicare.
[01:08:12.781 --> 01:08:13.621]  He beat it to death.
[01:08:13.721 --> 01:08:14.981]  And he's destroying Medicare.
[01:08:15.482 --> 01:08:17.682]  Because all of these people are coming in.
[01:08:17.982 --> 01:08:19.323]  They're putting them on Medicare.
[01:08:19.363 --> 01:08:21.384]  They're putting them on Social Security.
[01:08:21.404 --> 01:08:23.164]  They're going to destroy Social Security.
[01:08:23.204 --> 01:08:26.606]  This man is going to single-handedly destroy Social Security.
[01:08:26.626 --> 01:08:28.846]  And remember, Biden runs the Justice Department.
[01:08:29.307 --> 01:08:32.128]  They're trying to put Trump in jail right now and take him out of the ballot.
[01:08:32.388 --> 01:08:34.448]  They are getting their ass kicked right now.
[01:08:34.468 --> 01:08:35.749]  I'm sorry, I'm going to stop talking, but here it is.
[01:08:36.305 --> 01:08:38.806]  He's right in the way he finished that sentence and it's a shame.
[01:08:39.106 --> 01:08:43.667]  What's happened to our country in the last four years is not to be believed.
[01:08:44.067 --> 01:08:49.889]  Foreign countries, I'm friends with a lot of people, they cannot believe what happened to the United States of America.
[01:08:49.969 --> 01:08:51.170]  We're no longer respected.
[01:08:51.970 --> 01:08:53.751]  Biden's probably pooping himself right now.
[01:08:53.771 --> 01:08:55.671]  I'm serious, he craps himself.
[01:08:55.991 --> 01:08:57.772]  I believe he'll shit himself tonight.
[01:08:57.812 --> 01:09:08.033]   When Biden leaves the stage, he will be Thank you, President Trump.
[01:09:08.473 --> 01:09:13.416]  This is the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.
[01:09:14.076 --> 01:09:24.461]  This morning, the court ruled on yet another abortion case, temporarily allowing emergency abortions to continue in Idaho, despite that state's restrictive ban.
[01:09:25.002 --> 01:09:30.184]  Former President Trump, you take credit for the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.
[01:09:30.264 --> 01:09:33.046]  President Trump has Biden's butt been wiped.
[01:09:33.086 --> 01:09:33.386]  Correct.
[01:09:33.806 --> 01:09:40.676]  However, the federal government still plays a role in whether or not women have access to abortion pills.
[01:09:41.938 --> 01:09:45.162]  They're used in about two-thirds of all abortions.
[01:09:46.003 --> 01:09:49.108]  As president, would you block abortion medication?
[01:09:49.735 --> 01:09:57.222]  First of all, the Supreme Court just approved the abortion bill, and I agree with their decision to have done that, and I will not block it.
[01:09:57.923 --> 01:10:08.931]   And if you look at this whole question that you're asking, complex but not really complex, 51 years ago, You had Roe v. Wade, and everybody wanted to get it back to the states.
[01:10:09.071 --> 01:10:09.431]  Everybody.
[01:10:09.471 --> 01:10:10.291]  Without exception.
[01:10:10.352 --> 01:10:12.752]  Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives.
[01:10:13.392 --> 01:10:14.413]  Everybody wanted it back.
[01:10:14.473 --> 01:10:15.413]  Religious leaders.
[01:10:16.153 --> 01:10:23.595]  And what I did is I put three great Supreme Court justices on the court, and they happened to vote in favor of killing Roe v. Wade.
[01:10:23.655 --> 01:10:24.956]  Biden's not supposed to have notes.
[01:10:25.016 --> 01:10:26.136]  He's got a phone or something.
[01:10:26.156 --> 01:10:26.876]  He's reading notes.
[01:10:26.896 --> 01:10:28.297]  Or he's got an earpiece.
[01:10:28.797 --> 01:10:33.778]  Now, 10 years ago or so, they started talking about how many weeks and how many this and getting into other things.
[01:10:33.858 --> 01:10:40.079]  But every legal scholar throughout the world, the most respected, wanted it brought back to the states.
[01:10:40.199 --> 01:10:40.680]  I did that.
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.860]  Now the states are working it out.
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:46.501]  If you look at Ohio, it was a decision that was, it was an end result.
[01:10:46.601 --> 01:10:48.681]  It was a little bit more liberal than you would have thought.
[01:10:49.281 --> 01:10:50.942]  Kansas, I would say the same thing.
[01:10:51.522 --> 01:10:52.622]  Texas is different.
[01:10:52.662 --> 01:10:53.562]  Florida is different.
[01:10:53.882 --> 01:10:56.143]  But they're all making their own decisions right now.
[01:10:56.543 --> 01:11:00.582]   And right now, The states control it. That's the vote of the people.
[01:11:00.582 --> 01:11:05.382]   Like Ronald Reagan, I believe in the exceptions. I am a person that believes.
[01:11:05.382 --> 01:11:08.342]   And frankly, I think it's important to believe in the exceptions.
[01:11:08.342 --> 01:11:11.462]   Some people, you have to follow your heart. Some people don't believe in that.
[01:11:11.462 --> 01:11:16.421]   But I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.
[01:11:16.574 --> 01:11:17.594]  I think it's very important.
[01:11:18.074 --> 01:11:21.415]  Some people don't follow your heart, but you have to get elected also.
[01:11:21.715 --> 01:11:23.956]  And because that has to do with other things.
[01:11:23.976 --> 01:11:24.776]  You got to get elected.
[01:11:25.277 --> 01:11:32.419]  The problem they have is they're radical because they will take the life of a child in the eighth month, the ninth month, and even after birth.
[01:11:32.659 --> 01:11:37.200]  After birth, if you look at the former governor of Virginia, he was willing to do this.
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:41.362]  He said, we'll put the baby aside and we'll determine what we do with the baby.
[01:11:41.422 --> 01:11:42.442]  Meaning we'll keep him comfortable.
[01:11:43.649 --> 01:11:48.978]  What happened is we brought it back to the states and the country is now going to get better on this issue.
[01:11:49.038 --> 01:11:50.139]  It's been a great thing.
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:51.922]  Thank you, President Biden.
[01:11:52.103 --> 01:11:53.946]  It's been a terrible thing what you've done.
[01:11:54.485 --> 01:11:58.769]  The fact is that the vast majority of constitutional scholars supported Roe when it was decided.
[01:11:59.370 --> 01:12:00.051]  Supported Roe.
[01:12:00.831 --> 01:12:04.595]  And this idea that they were all against it is just ridiculous.
[01:12:05.136 --> 01:12:07.418]  And this is the guy who says the state should be able to have it.
[01:12:07.638 --> 01:12:18.369]  We're in a state where in six weeks, you don't even know whether you're pregnant or not, but you cannot see a doctor and have him decide on what your circumstances are, whether you need help.
[01:12:18.869 --> 01:12:24.071]  The idea that states are able to do this is a little like saying, we're going to turn civil rights back to the states.
[01:12:24.392 --> 01:12:25.852]  Let each state have a different role.
[01:12:26.472 --> 01:12:30.774]  Look, there's so many young women who have been, including a young woman who just was murdered.
[01:12:31.415 --> 01:12:40.259]  And the idea that she was murdered by an immigrant coming in, they talk about that.
[01:12:40.539 --> 01:12:41.279]  But here's the deal.
[01:12:41.619 --> 01:12:47.102]  There's a lot of young women who were raped by their in-laws, by their spouses.
[01:12:48.023 --> 01:12:48.904]  Brothers and sisters.
[01:12:49.626 --> 01:12:51.209]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:12:51.269 --> 01:12:52.090]  Unlike you raped your daughter?
[01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:53.253]  They could do nothing about it.
[01:12:53.593 --> 01:12:54.876]  And they tried to arrest him on the cross.
[01:12:54.896 --> 01:12:55.557]  Which now admits true?
[01:12:56.718 --> 01:12:57.739]  Yeah, you raped your daughter?
[01:12:57.559 --> 01:13:03.418]   How many young women murdered by the same people he allows to come across our border?
[01:13:03.418 --> 01:13:06.738]   We have a border that's the most dangerous place anywhere in the world.
[01:13:06.738 --> 01:13:09.418]  Consider the most dangerous place anywhere in the world.
[01:13:09.418 --> 01:13:12.139]   And he opened it up and these killers are coming into our country.
[01:13:12.139 --> 01:13:13.139]  No, we have no border.
[01:13:13.139 --> 01:13:15.659]  And they are raping and killing women.
[01:13:15.659 --> 01:13:16.778]  And it's a terrible thing.
[01:13:16.778 --> 01:13:21.458]   As far as the abortion is concerned, it is now back with the states, the states are voting.
[01:13:21.458 --> 01:13:24.738]  In many cases, it's frankly a very liberal decision.
[01:13:24.738 --> 01:13:26.859]  In many cases, it's the opposite.
[01:13:26.859 --> 01:13:30.858]   But they're voting and it's bringing it back to the vote of the people, which is what everybody
[01:13:30.858 --> 01:13:34.177]   wanted, including the founders if they knew about this issue.
[01:13:34.322 --> 01:13:34.522]  Bingo!
[01:13:34.542 --> 01:13:35.523]  Which, frankly, they didn't.
[01:13:36.103 --> 01:13:38.724]  But they would have... Everybody wanted it brought back.
[01:13:38.865 --> 01:13:40.505]  Ronald Reagan wanted it brought back.
[01:13:40.545 --> 01:13:41.586]  He wasn't able to get it.
[01:13:42.126 --> 01:13:46.469]  Everybody wanted it brought back, and many presidents had tried to get it back.
[01:13:47.069 --> 01:13:48.049]  I was the one to do it.
[01:13:48.150 --> 01:13:51.952]  And again, this gives it the vote of the people, and that's where they wanted it.
[01:13:51.972 --> 01:13:52.552]  That was Trump's promise.
[01:13:52.572 --> 01:13:54.373]  Every legal scholar wanted it that way.
[01:13:55.370 --> 01:13:56.751]  So they're gaming this by the questions.
[01:13:56.771 --> 01:13:57.651]  They're keeping it on abortion.
[01:13:57.771 --> 01:13:59.852]  See, the control is abortion.
[01:13:59.672 --> 01:14:05.632]   do that this is the same topic seven states have no legal restrictions on how
[01:14:05.632 --> 01:14:08.752]   far into a... So they're gaming this by the questions they're keeping on
[01:14:08.752 --> 01:14:13.632]   abortion. Do you support any legal limits on... See the control is abortion they're
[01:14:13.632 --> 01:14:16.391]  keeping it in that debate.
[01:14:16.391 --> 01:14:18.391]  which had three trimesters.
[01:14:17.541 --> 01:14:21.541]  First time, not World War III, not open borders.
[01:14:21.541 --> 01:14:24.541]  Second time is between a doctor and an extreme situation.
[01:14:24.541 --> 01:14:28.541]  A third time is between the doctor, I mean between the...
[01:14:28.541 --> 01:14:31.541]  And what about the Justice Department, the censorship?
[01:14:31.541 --> 01:14:32.541]  Where's that?
[01:14:33.049 --> 01:14:33.510]  Where's that?
[01:14:33.530 --> 01:14:35.332]  Trump's just bringing it up.
[01:14:35.412 --> 01:14:37.154]  They're controlling it by the questions.
[01:14:37.174 --> 01:14:37.855]  It's ridiculous.
[01:14:38.175 --> 01:14:38.716]  That's the last.
[01:14:39.056 --> 01:14:40.638]  No politician should be making that decision.
[01:14:41.019 --> 01:14:42.581]  A doctor should be making those decisions.
[01:14:42.901 --> 01:14:43.802]  That's how it should be run.
[01:14:43.822 --> 01:14:47.407]  Oh, like the Virginia governor said, we kill nine-month-old babies, keep them comfortable.
[01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:57.464]  So that means he can take the life of the baby in the ninth month and even after birth, because some states, Democrat run, take it after birth.
[01:14:57.484 --> 01:14:57.724]  New York.
[01:14:57.844 --> 01:15:02.746]  Again, the governor, former governor of Virginia, put the baby down, then we decide what to do with it.
[01:15:03.066 --> 01:15:09.109]  So he's willing to, as we say, rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month and kill the baby.
[01:15:09.769 --> 01:15:13.751]  Nobody wants that to happen, Democrat or Republican, nobody wants it to happen.
[01:15:15.168 --> 01:15:16.610]  That is simply not true.
[01:15:17.371 --> 01:15:19.515]  The Roe v. Wade does not provide for that.
[01:15:19.855 --> 01:15:21.017]  That's not the circumstance.
[01:15:21.398 --> 01:15:23.261]  By the way, CNN just broke their rule.
[01:15:23.281 --> 01:15:27.006]  They're supposed to have a minute, a minute, two minute, two minute.
[01:15:27.087 --> 01:15:29.671]  They just broke their rule right there for him.
[01:15:30.615 --> 01:15:33.058]  Roe v. Wade, you have late-term abortion.
[01:15:33.458 --> 01:15:35.561]  You can do whatever you want, depending on the state.
[01:15:35.581 --> 01:15:36.642]  You can do whatever you want.
[01:15:37.102 --> 01:15:38.384]  We don't think that's a good thing.
[01:15:38.444 --> 01:15:39.745]  We think it's a radical thing.
[01:15:40.025 --> 01:15:42.909]  We think the Democrats are the radicals, not the Republicans.
[01:15:43.209 --> 01:15:45.311]  For 51 years, that was the law.
[01:15:45.571 --> 01:15:47.974]  51 years, Constitutional Scholarship said it was the right way to go.
[01:15:47.994 --> 01:15:49.536]  Yeah, before that, we didn't kill babies.
[01:15:51.117 --> 01:15:53.518]  5,000 years ago we sacrificed kids to Moloch.
[01:15:53.598 --> 01:15:54.198]  It's okay.
[01:15:54.218 --> 01:15:56.739]  So now CNN don't know what to do.
[01:15:58.260 --> 01:15:59.300]  They've un-muted both mics.
[01:16:00.361 --> 01:16:01.801]  They've left their platform.
[01:16:01.941 --> 01:16:03.402]  They've left their rules right now.
[01:16:03.221 --> 01:16:08.100]   right now and they pass a universal ban on abortion period across the board.
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:09.541]  Seen in just a ban on the rules.
[01:16:09.541 --> 01:16:10.822]  Six weeks or seven or eight or ten weeks.
[01:16:10.822 --> 01:16:12.581]  Something very very conservative.
[01:16:12.581 --> 01:16:14.021]  But you're going to sign that bill?
[01:16:14.021 --> 01:16:15.060]  I'll veto it.
[01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:16.261]  He'll sign it.
[01:16:16.261 --> 01:16:17.140]  Thank you.
[01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:19.621]   Let's turn now to the issue of immigration and border security.
[01:16:19.621 --> 01:16:21.780]  They just turned Trump's mic off.
[01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:23.060]  They just gave Biden more time.
[01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:25.461]  They just did it.
[01:16:25.461 --> 01:16:26.181]  Overwhelming border station.
[01:16:26.181 --> 01:16:27.141]  They just did it.
[01:16:27.141 --> 01:16:31.381]   An overburdening city such as New York and Chicago and in some cases causing real safety
[01:16:31.381 --> 01:16:32.420]  and security concerns.
[01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:32.981]  They just did it.
[01:16:32.981 --> 01:16:34.981]  Given that, why should voters trust you?
[01:16:34.981 --> 01:16:36.980]  Biden got a full minute extra right there.
[01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:40.822]   Because we worked very hard to get a bipartisan agreement that not only...
[01:16:40.991 --> 01:16:42.292]  Oh, he always uses this.
[01:16:42.312 --> 01:16:43.552]  Oh, bipartisan, that's total amnesty.
[01:16:43.592 --> 01:16:43.793]  Wow.
[01:16:43.833 --> 01:16:45.233]  So, they just cheated Trump out of his response.
[01:16:45.313 --> 01:16:46.474]  Just caught him.
[01:16:46.614 --> 01:16:47.514]  At 8.21, they just cheated Trump.
[01:16:47.534 --> 01:16:48.715]  Right there they rigged it.
[01:16:48.755 --> 01:16:49.735]  They let him have a full minute extra.
[01:16:49.835 --> 01:16:51.196]  Boom, they just did it.
[01:16:51.016 --> 01:16:53.016]  Trump out of his response.
[01:16:53.016 --> 01:16:55.016]  They just caught him.
[01:16:55.016 --> 01:16:59.016]  At 821, they just cheated Trump.
[01:16:59.016 --> 01:17:01.016]  Right there they rigged it.
[01:17:01.016 --> 01:17:03.016]  They let him have a full minute extra.
[01:17:03.016 --> 01:17:05.016]  Boom, they just did it.
[01:17:05.016 --> 01:17:07.016]  Now it's about to get worse.
[01:17:07.016 --> 01:17:11.176]   sure the families were separated. That's not the right way to go.
[01:17:11.467 --> 01:17:20.033]  What I've done since I've changed the law, what's happened, I've changed it in a way that now you're in a situation where- And anything he does tonight, Bannon, they'll call a cheap fake.
[01:17:20.074 --> 01:17:23.276]  People coming across the border illegally, that's better than what he left off.
[01:17:23.356 --> 01:17:25.458]  Guys, get the clip of him saying immediately surge the border.
[01:17:25.478 --> 01:17:26.639]  Until we get the total ban.
[01:17:27.039 --> 01:17:28.460]  I'm going to cut into this debate and play that.
[01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:30.022]  When you're ready.
[01:17:30.422 --> 01:17:35.286]  Relative to what we're going to do with more border patrol and more asylum officers.
[01:17:35.831 --> 01:17:36.332]  President Trump?
[01:17:36.932 --> 01:17:39.035]  I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence.
[01:17:39.335 --> 01:17:40.696]  I don't think he knows what he said either.
[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:44.041]  We have the safest border in the history of our country.
[01:17:45.101 --> 01:17:46.102]  All he had to do was leave it.
[01:17:46.262 --> 01:17:47.222]  All he had to do was leave it.
[01:17:47.823 --> 01:17:53.885]  He decided to open up our border, open up our country to people that are from prisons.
[01:17:54.625 --> 01:17:57.787]  People that are from mental institutions, insane asylum.
[01:17:58.267 --> 01:17:58.667]  Terrorists.
[01:17:58.767 --> 01:18:01.769]  We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now.
[01:18:01.949 --> 01:18:02.589]  All terrorists.
[01:18:02.849 --> 01:18:03.649]  All over the world.
[01:18:03.689 --> 01:18:04.970]  Not just in South America.
[01:18:05.090 --> 01:18:05.770]  All over the world.
[01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:07.131]  They come from the Middle East.
[01:18:07.271 --> 01:18:07.651]  Everywhere.
[01:18:07.851 --> 01:18:09.092]  All over the world they're pouring in.
[01:18:09.952 --> 01:18:11.874]  And this guy just left it open.
[01:18:12.154 --> 01:18:15.117]  And he didn't need legislation, because I didn't have legislation.
[01:18:15.177 --> 01:18:16.158]  I said, close the border.
[01:18:16.178 --> 01:18:17.799]  We had the safest border in history.
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:28.449]  In that final couple of months of my presidency, we had, according to Border Patrol, who is great, and by the way, who endorsed me for president, but I won't say that, but they endorsed me for president.
[01:18:29.210 --> 01:18:30.552]  Brandon, just speak to him.
[01:18:31.032 --> 01:18:33.676]  But, look, we had the safest border in history.
[01:18:33.936 --> 01:18:35.218]  Now we have the worst border in history.
[01:18:35.378 --> 01:18:36.780]  There's never been anything like it.
[01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:41.225]  And people are dying all over the place, including the people that are coming up in caravans.
[01:18:41.265 --> 01:18:41.986]  Thank you, President Trump.
[01:18:42.006 --> 01:18:42.647]  President Biden?
[01:18:43.108 --> 01:18:45.771]  The only terrorist who's done anything crossing the border.
[01:18:46.604 --> 01:18:50.407]  In fact, make sure that there is- we immediately surge to the border.
[01:18:50.707 --> 01:18:52.148]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[01:18:52.368 --> 01:18:53.228]  They deserve to be heard.
[01:18:53.248 --> 01:18:54.009]  That's who we are.
[01:18:54.269 --> 01:18:57.651]  We're a nation that says if you want to flee, and you're fleeing oppression, you should come.
[01:18:57.671 --> 01:18:59.652]  In fact, make sure- Terrorists.
[01:18:59.993 --> 01:19:03.855]  I'm not saying no terrorist ever got through with the idea that they're emptying their prisons.
[01:19:03.895 --> 01:19:05.316]  We're welcoming these people.
[01:19:05.616 --> 01:19:06.657]  That's simply not true.
[01:19:06.677 --> 01:19:08.778]  There's no data to support what he said.
[01:19:09.159 --> 01:19:10.439]  Once again, he's exaggerating.
[01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:11.040]  He's lying.
[01:19:12.148 --> 01:19:14.150]  They're reporting thousands of Al-Qaeda coming at us.
[01:19:14.190 --> 01:19:14.870]  Just one second.
[01:19:14.710 --> 01:19:15.710]  of al-qaeda coming to us.
[01:19:15.710 --> 01:19:19.349]   You've been carrying out, quote, "the largest domestic deportation operation in American
[01:19:19.349 --> 01:19:20.670]  history," unquote.
[01:19:20.670 --> 01:19:24.949]   Does that mean that you will deport every undocumented immigrant in America, including
[01:19:24.949 --> 01:19:29.548]   those who have jobs, including those whose spouses are citizens, and including those
[01:19:29.548 --> 01:19:30.869]  who have lived here for decades?
[01:19:30.869 --> 01:19:33.389]  And if so, how will you do it?
[01:19:33.389 --> 01:19:34.389]  Just one second.
[01:19:34.389 --> 01:19:36.189]  He said we killed three people.
[01:19:36.189 --> 01:19:42.149]   The people we killed are al-Baghdadi and Salamani, the two greatest terrorists, biggest terrorists
[01:19:42.149 --> 01:19:47.069]   anywhere in the world, and it had a huge impact on everything, not just border, on everything.
[01:19:47.803 --> 01:19:56.315]   He's the one that killed people with the bad water, including Hundreds of thousands of people dying and also killing our citizens when they come in.
[01:19:56.795 --> 01:19:59.596]  We are living right now in a rat's nest.
[01:19:59.917 --> 01:20:06.500]  They're killing our people in New York, in California, in every state in the Union because we don't have borders anymore.
[01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:08.061]  Every state is now a border.
[01:20:08.601 --> 01:20:17.711]  And because of his ridiculous, insane and very stupid policies, people are coming in and they're killing our citizens at a level that we've never seen.
[01:20:17.731 --> 01:20:19.172]  We call it migrant crime.
[01:20:19.673 --> 01:20:21.615]  I call it Biden migrant crime.
[01:20:21.975 --> 01:20:25.158]  They're killing our citizens at a level that we've never seen before.
[01:20:25.459 --> 01:20:29.703]  And you're reading it like these three incredible young girls over the last few days.
[01:20:30.638 --> 01:20:36.160]  One of them, I just spoke to the mother, and he just had the funeral for this girl, 12 years old.
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:40.322]  This is horrible what's taken place, what's taken place in our country.
[01:20:40.922 --> 01:20:43.963]  We're literally an uncivilized country now.
[01:20:44.443 --> 01:20:46.264]  He doesn't want it to be, he just doesn't know.
[01:20:46.564 --> 01:20:54.687]  He opened the borders, nobody's ever seen anything like, and we have to get a lot of these people out, and we have to get them out fast, because they're going to destroy our country.
[01:20:54.947 --> 01:20:56.268]  Just take a look at where they're living.
[01:20:56.668 --> 01:21:00.750]   They're living in luxury hotels, In New York City and other places.
[01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:02.731]  Our veterans are on the street.
[01:21:02.751 --> 01:21:04.852]  They're dying because he doesn't care about our veterans.
[01:21:04.872 --> 01:21:05.372]  He doesn't care.
[01:21:05.412 --> 01:21:07.033]  He doesn't like the military at all.
[01:21:07.614 --> 01:21:08.914]  And he doesn't care about our veterans.
[01:21:09.014 --> 01:21:09.855]  Nobody been worse.
[01:21:10.295 --> 01:21:13.797]  I had the highest approval rating for veterans taking care of the VA.
[01:21:14.337 --> 01:21:14.957]  He has the worst.
[01:21:14.997 --> 01:21:17.039]  He's gotten rid of all the things that I approved.
[01:21:17.139 --> 01:21:18.800]  Choice that I got through Congress.
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:21.121]  All of the different things I approved.
[01:21:21.641 --> 01:21:22.402]  They abandoned.
[01:21:22.822 --> 01:21:28.666]  We had by far the highest and now it's down in less than half because he's done all these great things that we did.
[01:21:29.127 --> 01:21:32.069]  And I think he did it just because I approved it, which is crazy.
[01:21:32.569 --> 01:21:36.773]  But he has killed so many people at our border by allowing all of these people to come in.
[01:21:37.153 --> 01:21:38.994]  And it's a very sad day in America.
[01:21:39.955 --> 01:21:41.475]  Every single thing he said is a lie.
[01:21:42.096 --> 01:21:42.856]  Every single one.
[01:21:43.196 --> 01:21:47.137]  For example, veterans are a hell of a lot better off since I passed the PACT Act.
[01:21:47.837 --> 01:21:50.958]  One million of them now have insurance and their families have it.
[01:21:51.478 --> 01:21:57.480]  Their families have it because what happened, whether it was Agent Orange or burn pits, they're all being covered now.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.160]  And his group opposed that.
[01:22:00.521 --> 01:22:04.001]  We're also in a situation where we have great respect for veterans.
[01:22:04.042 --> 01:22:05.302]  My son spent a year in Iraq.
[01:22:05.721 --> 01:22:11.100]   Maybe when the next one of those burn pits came back with stage four glioblastoma. I was recently in
[01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:17.320]   France for a D-Day and I spoke all about those heroes that died
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:21.881]   I went to the World War two cemetery World War one cemetery refused to go to
[01:22:21.881 --> 01:22:27.112]   He was standing with his four-star general and he told me said I don't want to go in there because they're a bunch of
[01:22:27.112 --> 01:22:30.862]   losers I'm suckers. My son was not a loser was not a sucker. You're
[01:22:30.862 --> 01:22:36.362]   the sucker. You're the loser another lie President Trump First of all, that was a made-up quote.
[01:22:36.115 --> 01:22:37.055]  Suckers and losers.
[01:22:37.115 --> 01:22:37.755]  They made it up.
[01:22:37.835 --> 01:22:41.416]  It was in a third-rate magazine that's failing, like many of these magazines.
[01:22:42.017 --> 01:22:42.657]  He made that up.
[01:22:43.057 --> 01:22:44.217]  He put it in commercials.
[01:22:44.317 --> 01:22:45.218]  We've notified him.
[01:22:45.598 --> 01:22:47.739]  We had 19 people that said, I didn't say it.
[01:22:47.799 --> 01:22:48.359]  And think of this.
[01:22:48.739 --> 01:22:52.440]  Who would say, I'm at a cemetery or I'm talking about our veterans?
[01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:54.321]  Because nobody's taking better care.
[01:22:54.341 --> 01:22:55.521]  I'm so glad this came up.
[01:22:55.882 --> 01:22:56.642]  And he brought it up.
[01:22:57.639 --> 01:23:00.641]  There's nobody that's taken better care of our soldiers than I have.
[01:23:01.261 --> 01:23:05.684]  To think that I would, in front of generals and others, say, suckers and losers.
[01:23:05.704 --> 01:23:09.607]  We have 19 people that said, it was never said by me.
[01:23:10.127 --> 01:23:11.188]  It was made up by him.
[01:23:11.268 --> 01:23:13.329]  Just like Russia, Russia, Russia was made up.
[01:23:13.670 --> 01:23:16.251]  Just like the 51 intelligence agents.
[01:23:16.271 --> 01:23:17.072]  Trump's dominating.
[01:23:17.532 --> 01:23:18.073]  This is slaughter.
[01:23:18.113 --> 01:23:20.135]  Despite the fact they put all that new blood in Biden.
[01:23:19.954 --> 01:23:21.634]  are talking, it's the same thing.
[01:23:21.634 --> 01:23:26.914]   51 intelligence agents said that the flap top was Russia disinformation.
[01:23:26.914 --> 01:23:27.914]  It wasn't.
[01:23:27.914 --> 01:23:29.873]  That came from his son, Hunter.
[01:23:29.873 --> 01:23:31.835]  It wasn't Russia disinformation.
[01:23:31.835 --> 01:23:40.555]   He made up the suckers and losers, so he should apologize to me right now.
[01:23:40.976 --> 01:23:41.376]  Period.
[01:23:41.757 --> 01:23:42.498]  That's number one.
[01:23:43.038 --> 01:23:48.545]  And number two, the idea that I have to apologize to you for anything along the line.
[01:23:48.966 --> 01:23:51.790]  We've done more for such a general in American history.
[01:23:52.350 --> 01:23:52.690]  All right.
[01:23:52.510 --> 01:23:56.710]   history and they now are in their family. The only sacred obligation we have as a
[01:23:56.710 --> 01:24:00.510]   country is to care for our veterans when they come home and their families and
[01:24:00.510 --> 01:24:03.769]  equip them when they go to war. That's what we're doing.
[01:24:03.769 --> 01:24:07.519]   That's what the VA is doing now. They're doing more for veterans than ever before
[01:24:07.519 --> 01:24:08.109]  in our history.
[01:24:08.109 --> 01:24:11.349]  All right, thank you so much.
[01:24:11.909 --> 01:24:17.989]   I want to begin with Russia's war against Ukraine, which is now in its third year.
[01:24:17.989 --> 01:24:23.909]   Former President Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin says he'll only end this war
[01:24:23.909 --> 01:24:28.209]   if Russia keeps the Ukrainian territory it has already claimed.
[01:24:28.209 --> 01:24:32.549]  And Ukraine abandoned to join NATO.
[01:24:32.549 --> 01:24:34.909]  Are Putin's terms acceptable to you?
[01:24:34.909 --> 01:24:39.268]   First of all, our veterans and our soldiers can't stand this guy.
[01:24:39.831 --> 01:24:40.851]  They can't stand him.
[01:24:41.111 --> 01:24:42.872]  They think he's the worst commander in chief.
[01:24:42.912 --> 01:24:43.212]  Beautiful.
[01:24:43.252 --> 01:24:44.053]  That's what you call him.
[01:24:44.753 --> 01:24:45.653]  Trump's on fire.
[01:24:45.774 --> 01:24:46.614]  They can't stand him.
[01:24:46.874 --> 01:24:47.875]  So let's get that straight.
[01:24:48.515 --> 01:24:50.616]  And they like me more than just about any of them.
[01:24:51.336 --> 01:24:54.037]  And that's based on every single bit of information.
[01:24:54.518 --> 01:25:01.001]  As far as Russia and Ukraine, if we had a real president, the president that knew that was respected by Putin.
[01:25:01.821 --> 01:25:02.421]  He would have never.
[01:25:02.461 --> 01:25:04.303]  He would have never invaded Ukraine.
[01:25:04.943 --> 01:25:07.825]  A lot of people are dead right now, much more than people know.
[01:25:07.865 --> 01:25:09.065]  You know, they talk about numbers.
[01:25:09.085 --> 01:25:11.367]  You can double those numbers, maybe triple those numbers.
[01:25:12.267 --> 01:25:13.448]  He did nothing to stop it.
[01:25:13.468 --> 01:25:15.749]  In fact, I think he encouraged Russia from going in.
[01:25:16.249 --> 01:25:17.010]  I'll tell you what happened.
[01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:18.711]  He was so bad with Afghanistan.
[01:25:18.791 --> 01:25:30.758]  It was such a horrible embarrassment, most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, that when Putin watched that and he saw the incompetence that he should, he should have fired those generals like I fired the one that you mentioned.
[01:25:31.158 --> 01:25:32.519]  And so he's got no love lost.
[01:25:32.879 --> 01:25:34.279]  But he should have fired those generals.
[01:25:34.419 --> 01:25:43.642]  No general got fired for the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, Afghanistan, where we left billions of dollars of equipment behind.
[01:25:43.922 --> 01:25:48.304]  We lost 13 beautiful soldiers and 38 soldiers were obliterated.
[01:25:48.404 --> 01:25:50.124]  And by the way, we left people behind, too.
[01:25:50.144 --> 01:25:51.785]  We left American citizens behind.
[01:25:52.225 --> 01:25:54.667]  When Putin saw that, he said, you know what?
[01:25:54.987 --> 01:25:58.710]  I think we're going to go in and maybe take my... This was his dream.
[01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:59.931]  I talked to him about it.
[01:25:59.971 --> 01:26:00.352]  His dream.
[01:26:00.652 --> 01:26:04.275]  The difference is he never would have invaded Ukraine.
[01:26:04.455 --> 01:26:04.795]  Never.
[01:26:05.476 --> 01:26:08.198]  Just like Israel would have never been invaded.
[01:26:09.306 --> 01:26:10.947]  In a million years by Hamas.
[01:26:11.628 --> 01:26:12.149]  You know why?
[01:26:12.729 --> 01:26:14.591]  Because Iran was broke with me.
[01:26:14.831 --> 01:26:16.632]  I wouldn't let anybody do business with them.
[01:26:16.712 --> 01:26:17.673]  They ran out of money.
[01:26:17.713 --> 01:26:18.274]  They were broke.
[01:26:18.294 --> 01:26:19.495]  They had no money for Hamas.
[01:26:19.815 --> 01:26:21.236]  They had no money for anything.
[01:26:21.537 --> 01:26:22.317]  No money for terror.
[01:26:22.537 --> 01:26:26.121]  That's why you had no terror at all during my administration.
[01:26:26.621 --> 01:26:29.023]  This place, the whole world is blowing up under him.
[01:26:30.664 --> 01:26:31.165]  President Biden.
[01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:34.052]  Never heard so much malarkey in my whole life.
[01:26:34.112 --> 01:26:37.252]   Look, the fact of the matter is that we're in a situation where, let's take the last
[01:26:37.252 --> 01:26:44.551]   point first, Iran attacked American troops, killed, caused brain damage for a number of
[01:26:44.551 --> 01:26:46.951]  these troops, and he did nothing about it.
[01:26:46.951 --> 01:26:48.752]  Not when he was president.
[01:26:48.752 --> 01:26:49.832]  Here they attacked.
[01:26:49.832 --> 01:26:51.551]  He said they're just having headaches.
[01:26:51.551 --> 01:26:52.551]  That's all it is.
[01:26:52.551 --> 01:26:56.310]  He didn't do a thing when the attack took place, number one.
[01:26:56.310 --> 01:27:03.551]   Number two, we got over 100,000 Americans and others out of Afghanistan during that
[01:27:03.551 --> 01:27:04.631]  airlift.
[01:27:04.631 --> 01:27:09.431]   Number three, we found ourselves in a situation where, if you take a look at what Trump did
[01:27:09.431 --> 01:27:15.431]  in Ukraine, this guy told Trump, "Do whatever you want.
[01:27:15.431 --> 01:27:16.511]  Do whatever you want."
[01:27:17.112 --> 01:27:20.294]  And that's exactly what Trump did to Putin.
[01:27:20.314 --> 01:27:21.855]  Encourage him, do whatever you want.
[01:27:22.196 --> 01:27:22.816]  And he went in.
[01:27:22.916 --> 01:27:24.177]  Listen to what he said when he went in.
[01:27:24.197 --> 01:27:26.298]  He was going to take Kiev in five days.
[01:27:26.358 --> 01:27:26.699]  Remember?
[01:27:27.019 --> 01:27:28.680]  Because it's part of the old Soviet Union.
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:30.481]  That's what he wanted to reestablish.
[01:27:31.082 --> 01:27:31.442]  Kiev.
[01:27:31.822 --> 01:27:33.523]  And he, in fact, didn't do it at all.
[01:27:33.583 --> 01:27:35.084]  He wasn't able to get it done.
[01:27:35.504 --> 01:27:38.566]  And they've lost thousands and thousands of troops.
[01:27:38.587 --> 01:27:38.887]  500,000 troops.
[01:27:41.228 --> 01:27:41.648]  I never said that.
[01:27:41.668 --> 01:27:42.209]  No, they're not acceptable.
[01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:43.749]  But look, this is a war that never should have started.
[01:27:43.569 --> 01:27:50.368]   I just want to go back to my original question, which is are Putin's terms acceptable to you keeping the territory?
[01:27:50.368 --> 01:27:55.649]   No, they're not acceptable But look, this is a war that never should have started if
[01:27:55.649 --> 01:28:02.248]   we had a leader in this war. He led everybody along He's given two hundred billion dollars now or more
[01:28:02.248 --> 01:28:06.569]   To Ukraine he's given two hundred billion dollars. That's a lot of money
[01:28:06.569 --> 01:28:09.189]   I don't think there's ever been anything like it every time that
[01:28:09.849 --> 01:28:14.809]   Zelensky comes to this country. He walks away with sixty billion dollars. He's the greatest salesman ever and I'm
[01:28:14.809 --> 01:28:18.919]   not knocking him I'm not knocking anything. I'm only saying he's the money
[01:28:18.919 --> 01:28:23.241]   that was spending on this war And we shouldn't be spending.
[01:28:23.601 --> 01:28:24.742]  It should have never happened.
[01:28:25.163 --> 01:28:28.706]  I will have that war settled between Putin and Zelensky.
[01:28:28.726 --> 01:28:29.646]  This will cut the money off.
[01:28:29.666 --> 01:28:32.869]  As president-elect before I take office on January 20th.
[01:28:32.929 --> 01:28:33.910]  I'll have that war settled.
[01:28:34.290 --> 01:28:38.734]  Alright, Trump is completely dominating despite CNN giving extra time to Biden.
[01:28:39.694 --> 01:28:40.875]  Trump's gonna win a landslide.
[01:28:40.915 --> 01:28:41.916]  I'm just gonna say this right now.
[01:28:42.657 --> 01:28:43.537]  Total domination.
[01:28:43.577 --> 01:28:44.058]  Go back to it.
[01:28:45.882 --> 01:28:48.044]  The fact is that Putin is a war criminal.
[01:28:48.584 --> 01:28:51.286]  He's killed thousands and thousands of people.
[01:28:52.007 --> 01:28:53.668]  And he has made one thing clear.
[01:28:54.168 --> 01:28:57.511]  He wants to re-establish what was part of the Soviet Empire.
[01:28:57.911 --> 01:28:59.952]  Not just a peace, he wants all of Ukraine.
[01:29:00.333 --> 01:29:01.073]  That's what he wants.
[01:29:01.373 --> 01:29:02.654]  And then do you think he'll stop there?
[01:29:02.674 --> 01:29:06.377]  Do you think he'll stop when he, if he takes Ukraine?
[01:29:06.757 --> 01:29:07.938]  What do you think happens to Poland?
[01:29:07.978 --> 01:29:09.179]  What do you think of Belarus?
[01:29:09.219 --> 01:29:11.121]  What do you think happens to those NATO countries?
[01:29:11.141 --> 01:29:13.983]  That's like saying we gotta attack the Middle East or the Muslims will come here.
[01:29:14.603 --> 01:29:15.984]  And then they bring all the Muslims here.
[01:29:16.084 --> 01:29:25.292]  I mean, no, the West admits they overthrew the Ukrainian government ten years ago, they started the war, they did it all to lure Russia into World War III.
[01:29:25.952 --> 01:29:27.233]  Which I told Russia they shouldn't do.
[01:29:27.974 --> 01:29:28.794]  But now it's on.
[01:29:29.155 --> 01:29:32.237]  And the dollars die because of this guy's bad management.
[01:29:35.250 --> 01:29:35.570]  Thank you.
[01:29:35.610 --> 01:29:36.831]  Moving on to the Middle East.
[01:29:37.472 --> 01:29:41.576]  In October, Hamas attacked Israel, killing more than 1,000 people.
[01:29:41.636 --> 01:29:44.058]  And Biden gave $6 billion about the war to Iran.
[01:29:44.498 --> 01:29:48.241]  Among those held and thought to still be alive are five Americans.
[01:29:49.042 --> 01:29:54.146]  Israel's response has killed thousands of Palestinians and created a humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
[01:29:54.867 --> 01:30:00.171]  President Biden, you've put forward a proposal to resolve this conflict.
[01:30:00.671 --> 01:30:08.036]  But so far, Hamas has not released the remaining hostages and Israel is continuing its military offensive in Gaza.
[01:30:08.596 --> 01:30:14.360]  So what additional leverage will you use to get Hamas and Israel to end the war?
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:15.181]  You have two minutes.
[01:30:15.663 --> 01:30:22.585]  Number one, everyone from the United Nations Security Council straight through to the G7.
[01:30:22.625 --> 01:30:24.046]  He's disintegrating.
[01:30:24.126 --> 01:30:26.466]  Netanyahu himself has endorsed the plan I put forward.
[01:30:26.986 --> 01:30:28.347]  Endorsed the plan I put forward.
[01:30:28.767 --> 01:30:30.267]  Which has three stages to it.
[01:30:30.347 --> 01:30:31.528]  The first stage is...
[01:30:36.254 --> 01:30:37.835]  No, Netanyahu wants to continue to stay in power.
[01:30:37.855 --> 01:30:38.155]  Moralize.
[01:30:38.175 --> 01:30:39.336]  I'm not for the Muslims.
[01:30:39.155 --> 01:30:44.756]   is no, the end of the war. The only one who wants the war to continue is Hamas, number
[01:30:44.756 --> 01:30:49.956]   one. They're the only ones standing out. We're still pushing hard to get them to accept.
[01:30:49.956 --> 01:30:54.155]  No, Netanyahu wants to continue to stay in power. More lies.
[01:30:54.155 --> 01:30:55.756]  I'm not for the Muslims.
[01:30:55.756 --> 01:30:59.756]   Get that straight. Two thousand pound bombs. They don't work very well in populated areas.
[01:30:59.756 --> 01:31:03.155]   They kill a lot of innocent people. We're providing Israel with all the weapons they
[01:31:03.155 --> 01:31:04.354]  need and when they need them.
[01:31:04.354 --> 01:31:06.354]  That's another lie.
[01:31:05.497 --> 01:31:06.798]  They blocked Israel getting the weapons.
[01:31:06.958 --> 01:31:10.362]  By the way, I'm not even for them getting the weapons, but everything he says is a lie!
[01:31:11.763 --> 01:31:14.085]  God Almighty!
[01:31:14.346 --> 01:31:22.794]  By the way, Harrison, Owen, in case you guys are willing, a little quick pop-ins if you want to say anything, but right now Biden's getting his ass kicked.
[01:31:22.834 --> 01:31:24.296]  I mean, Trump is leveling his ass.
[01:31:26.249 --> 01:31:26.809]  Owen, you agree?
[01:31:26.949 --> 01:31:28.550]  Turn Owen up.
[01:31:28.930 --> 01:31:32.091]  This is undeniably an absolute slaughter.
[01:31:32.731 --> 01:31:36.432]  And look, I actually gotta give CNN credit.
[01:31:36.452 --> 01:31:39.293]  They're conducting a pretty square debate so far, I would say.
[01:31:39.333 --> 01:31:42.254]  Well, they're cheating a little for Biden, but you're right, because they know the world.
[01:31:42.374 --> 01:31:42.914]  I agree.
[01:31:43.774 --> 01:31:49.536]  I mean, but look, Biden, right out of the gates, lost his voice, and he's quickly deteriorating with 60 minutes left.
[01:31:49.556 --> 01:31:53.017]  I agree.
[01:31:53.397 --> 01:31:54.177]  Chase, you want to say something?
[01:31:54.833 --> 01:31:57.355]  Yeah, well... Back to Trump, back to Trump, and back to you, go ahead.
[01:31:57.716 --> 01:31:57.956]  Sure.
[01:32:00.738 --> 01:32:04.702]  I've spent a hundred billion, or maybe more than that, less than us.
[01:32:05.763 --> 01:32:09.125]  Why doesn't he call them and say, you gotta put up your money like I did with NATO?
[01:32:09.185 --> 01:32:11.648]  I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars.
[01:32:11.668 --> 01:32:15.771]  The Secretary General of NATO said Trump did the most incredible job I've ever seen.
[01:32:16.192 --> 01:32:18.293]  You wouldn't, they wouldn't have any, they were going out of business.
[01:32:18.313 --> 01:32:22.097]  We were spending almost a hundred percent of the money was paid by us.
[01:32:23.237 --> 01:32:23.917]  He didn't do that.
[01:32:24.537 --> 01:32:27.458]  He's getting all you got to ask these people to put up the money.
[01:32:27.738 --> 01:32:35.041]  We're over a hundred billion dollars more spent and it has a bigger impact on them because of location because we have an ocean in between.
[01:32:35.401 --> 01:32:37.782]  You got to ask him as far as Israel.
[01:32:38.542 --> 01:32:39.803]  And Hamas.
[01:32:40.503 --> 01:32:41.584]  Israel's the one that wants to go.
[01:32:41.624 --> 01:32:43.925]  He said the only one who wants to keep going is Hamas.
[01:32:44.265 --> 01:32:45.506]  Actually, Israel is the one.
[01:32:45.726 --> 01:32:47.868]  And you should let him go and let him finish the job.
[01:32:48.108 --> 01:32:48.848]  He doesn't want to do it.
[01:32:48.888 --> 01:32:50.429]  He's become like a Palestinian.
[01:32:50.969 --> 01:32:53.451]  But they don't like him because he's a very bad Palestinian.
[01:32:53.491 --> 01:32:54.211]  He's a weak one.
[01:32:55.572 --> 01:32:56.733]  President Biden, you have a minute.
[01:32:57.153 --> 01:32:58.554]  I've never heard so much foolishness.
[01:32:58.954 --> 01:33:00.695]  That's all three wants to get out of NATO.
[01:33:00.715 --> 01:33:01.656]  You're going to stay in NATO.
[01:33:02.335 --> 01:33:03.396]  He's going to pull out of NATO.
[01:33:03.936 --> 01:33:05.277]  He made NATO pony up.
[01:33:06.038 --> 01:33:08.280]  Trump is transactional.
[01:33:08.300 --> 01:33:09.020]  Fade down Biden.
[01:33:09.341 --> 01:33:11.182]  Let's go to Chase Geiser and Harrison Smith.
[01:33:11.202 --> 01:33:11.723]  You want to comment?
[01:33:11.743 --> 01:33:12.283]  We don't need to hear.
[01:33:12.603 --> 01:33:14.445]  People that want Biden, you can tune into that.
[01:33:14.485 --> 01:33:15.285]  We're giving commentary.
[01:33:15.305 --> 01:33:17.047]  Go ahead, Chase.
[01:33:17.067 --> 01:33:17.687]  Sure, sure.
[01:33:17.727 --> 01:33:20.690]  Well, the thing I noticed was right out of the gate, he didn't even have his voice.
[01:33:20.710 --> 01:33:22.531]  It's not even that he lost his voice during the debate.
[01:33:22.591 --> 01:33:25.273]   He didn't have it to begin with, which shows That's right.
[01:33:25.113 --> 01:33:29.792]   He has been speaking and practicing this week, speaking more than he normally speaks, right?
[01:33:29.792 --> 01:33:34.193]   And you'd think the President of the United States would speak all day, every day in meetings,
[01:33:34.193 --> 01:33:36.073]  phone calls with international leaders.
[01:33:36.073 --> 01:33:39.913]  This proves to me that Biden is doing very little speaking.
[01:33:39.913 --> 01:33:40.913]  That's right.
[01:33:40.913 --> 01:33:42.713]  Real quick, Harrison Smith.
[01:33:42.713 --> 01:33:48.233]   Well, what I've noticed so far is that they've given basically every last word has gone to
[01:33:48.592 --> 01:33:51.835]  Biden's gotten a chance to close out the conversation on every single topic so far.
[01:33:51.895 --> 01:33:55.277]  So they are still rigging it quite blatantly in front of everybody.
[01:33:55.297 --> 01:33:58.740]  I want to listen to Biden, though, because I'm afraid we're going to miss a big blunder here.
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:33:59.801]  We don't want to miss that, do we?
[01:33:59.861 --> 01:34:00.341]  No, you're right.
[01:34:00.461 --> 01:34:00.781]  Go back.
[01:34:01.922 --> 01:34:04.464]  The problem we have is that we spend all the money.
[01:34:05.025 --> 01:34:06.125]  So they kill us on trade.
[01:34:06.165 --> 01:34:08.867]  I made great trade deals with the European nations.
[01:34:09.775 --> 01:34:12.778]  Because if you add them up, they're about the same size economically.
[01:34:13.299 --> 01:34:16.022]  Their economy is about the same size as the United States.
[01:34:16.462 --> 01:34:23.630]  And they were written, no cars, no... They don't want anything that we have, but we're supposed to take their cars, their food, their everything, their agriculture.
[01:34:23.670 --> 01:34:24.131]  Exactly.
[01:34:24.411 --> 01:34:25.112]  I changed that.
[01:34:25.232 --> 01:34:26.133]  This is why they hate Trump.
[01:34:26.153 --> 01:34:29.257]  The big thing I changed is... Because the globalists are middlemen selling it to us.
[01:34:29.777 --> 01:34:30.958]  This is why they hate Trump.
[01:34:31.699 --> 01:34:32.860]  He's at least going to get us the money.
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:40.387]  ...got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars, I said, and he's right about this, I said, no, I'm not going to support NATO if you don't pay.
[01:34:40.987 --> 01:34:49.635]  They asked me that question, would you guard us against Russia at a very secret meeting of the 28 states at that time, nations at that time.
[01:34:49.935 --> 01:34:52.457]  And I said, no, if you don't pay, I won't do that.
[01:34:52.537 --> 01:34:53.298]  And you know what happened?
[01:34:53.918 --> 01:34:57.982]  Billions and billions of dollars came flowing in the next day and the next months.
[01:34:58.968 --> 01:35:00.409]  But now we're in the same position.
[01:35:00.449 --> 01:35:00.930]  Exactly.
[01:35:00.970 --> 01:35:02.331]  We're paying everybody's bills.
[01:35:02.891 --> 01:35:04.513]  Let's turn to the issue of democracy.
[01:35:04.553 --> 01:35:06.675]  Let me just say, you're right.
[01:35:07.095 --> 01:35:13.861]  I get, Owen, it's not as bad as we thought it would be, but I think Trump is getting like, I think Biden's getting 20% more time here.
[01:35:15.082 --> 01:35:16.603]  Maybe, but that's not helping him.
[01:35:16.743 --> 01:35:18.685]  I mean, unintentionally, it's hurting him.
[01:35:18.845 --> 01:35:20.246]  No, I agree with you, Owen.
[01:35:20.287 --> 01:35:21.347]  There's definitely shaving here.
[01:35:21.387 --> 01:35:21.788]  Let's go back.
[01:35:22.830 --> 01:35:29.552]  What do you say to voters who believe that you violated that oath through your actions and inaction on January 6th and worry that you'll do it again?
[01:35:29.572 --> 01:35:31.193]  Well, I don't think too many believe that.
[01:35:31.273 --> 01:35:32.874]  And let me tell you about January 6th.
[01:35:33.654 --> 01:35:36.175]  On January 6th, we had a great border.
[01:35:36.874 --> 01:35:37.655]  Nobody coming through.
[01:35:37.675 --> 01:35:38.916]  See, now it's all anti-Trump crap.
[01:35:38.936 --> 01:35:40.958]  On January 6th, we were energy independent.
[01:35:41.038 --> 01:35:41.839]  Oh God, five cops got beat up.
[01:35:41.879 --> 01:35:43.000]  On January 6th, we had the lowest tax ever.
[01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:44.081]  Five citizens got killed.
[01:35:44.141 --> 01:35:45.603]  On January 6th, we were the lowest regulation ever.
[01:35:45.763 --> 01:35:46.764]  This is where the ringing comes in.
[01:35:46.784 --> 01:35:47.104]  Get ready, folks.
[01:35:47.124 --> 01:35:48.545]  On January 6th, we were respected all over the world.
[01:35:48.565 --> 01:35:49.847]  Now the real ringing's about to happen.
[01:35:49.867 --> 01:35:51.048]  All over the world, we were respected.
[01:35:51.428 --> 01:35:53.911]  And then he comes in, and we're now left at.
[01:35:54.011 --> 01:35:55.812]  We're like a bunch of stupid people.
[01:35:56.793 --> 01:36:02.578]   What happened to the United States' reputation under this man's leadership is horrible.
[01:36:02.578 --> 01:36:04.578]  I love how Trump ignored the question, that's good.
[01:36:04.578 --> 01:36:08.497]   Which I'm sure at some point you'll be talking about, where he goes after his political opponent
[01:36:08.497 --> 01:36:11.057]  because he can't beat him fair and square.
[01:36:11.057 --> 01:36:12.497]  You have 80 seconds left.
[01:36:12.507 --> 01:36:22.549]  My question was, what do you say to those voters who believe that you violated your constitutional oath through your actions in an action on January 6th, 2001, and worry that you'll do it again?
[01:36:22.689 --> 01:36:24.470]  Well, I didn't say that to anybody.
[01:36:24.930 --> 01:36:27.250]  I said, peacefully and patriotically.
[01:36:27.450 --> 01:36:39.234]   And Nancy Pelosi, if you just watched the news from two days ago, on tape to her daughter, who's a documentary filmmaker, they say, But she's saying, oh, no, it's my responsibility.
[01:36:39.294 --> 01:36:45.437]  I was responsible for this because I offered her 10,000 soldiers or National Guard and she turned them down.
[01:36:45.477 --> 01:36:49.819]  And the mayor of in writing, by the way, the mayor in writing turned it down.
[01:36:49.859 --> 01:36:51.000]  The mayor of D.C.
[01:36:52.020 --> 01:36:52.781]  They turned it down.
[01:36:53.101 --> 01:36:57.726]  I offered $10,000 because I could see I had virtually nothing to do.
[01:36:57.766 --> 01:36:59.007]  They asked me to go make a speech.
[01:36:59.628 --> 01:37:00.629]  I could see what was happening.
[01:37:00.689 --> 01:37:02.811]  Everybody was saying they're going to be there on January 6th.
[01:37:02.851 --> 01:37:03.512]  They're going to be there.
[01:37:03.912 --> 01:37:04.813]  And I said, you know what?
[01:37:04.913 --> 01:37:06.075]  There's a lot of people coming.
[01:37:06.135 --> 01:37:06.815]  You could feel it.
[01:37:06.956 --> 01:37:07.816]  You could feel it, too.
[01:37:07.937 --> 01:37:08.797]  And you could feel it.
[01:37:09.298 --> 01:37:10.780]  And I said, they ought to have some.
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:12.481]  National Guard or whatever.
[01:37:12.501 --> 01:37:13.441]  Totally honest response.
[01:37:13.481 --> 01:37:17.043]  And I offered it to her, and she now admits that she turned it down.
[01:37:17.463 --> 01:37:23.006]  And it was the same day she was, I don't know, he can't be very happy with her daughter because it made her into a liar.
[01:37:23.406 --> 01:37:26.988]  She said, I take full responsibility for January 6th.
[01:37:28.109 --> 01:37:28.629]  President Biden?
[01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:33.852]  Look, he encouraged those folks from up in Capitol Hill, number one.
[01:37:34.634 --> 01:37:35.715]  I sat in that dining room.
[01:37:35.755 --> 01:37:36.995]  He was going to give a speech there.
[01:37:37.335 --> 01:37:38.116]  Liar!
[01:37:38.236 --> 01:37:38.756]  I was there.
[01:37:38.776 --> 01:37:48.680]  Three hours watching, begging, being begged by his vice president and a number of his colleagues on the Republican side as well to do something, to call for a stop, to end it.
[01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:50.781]  Instead he talked about these people being patriots.
[01:37:50.821 --> 01:37:52.522]  No, Trump immediately said be peaceful.
[01:37:52.542 --> 01:37:54.082]  He said it during his speech.
[01:37:54.102 --> 01:37:54.182]  Liar!
[01:37:55.623 --> 01:37:58.487]  He says he'll now put our co-host Owen in jail.
[01:37:58.908 --> 01:38:00.530]  Owen, come in here and respond to this.
[01:38:00.550 --> 01:38:01.771]  I want to hear his crap.
[01:38:01.892 --> 01:38:04.575]  You were put in jail for months for peacefully with me.
[01:38:04.615 --> 01:38:05.977]  The Fed said you didn't work here.
[01:38:06.318 --> 01:38:08.360]  Told a judge to put you in jail longer for lying about it.
[01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:09.562]  You've been here seven years.
[01:38:09.902 --> 01:38:10.784]  What do you say to this crap?
[01:38:11.886 --> 01:38:17.650]  Well let me just say, Donald Trump's response to that rigged setup question was just about perfect.
[01:38:17.910 --> 01:38:19.992]  I don't know if he could have answered that question better.
[01:38:20.812 --> 01:38:23.514]  But more importantly, this just doesn't resonate with voters.
[01:38:23.754 --> 01:38:26.516]  Voters do not care about January 6th.
[01:38:26.616 --> 01:38:27.577]  It just doesn't matter.
[01:38:28.397 --> 01:38:35.564]  I don't think the undecided voter is sitting here biting their nails over January 6th or, you know, what Trump did or didn't do on that day.
[01:38:35.844 --> 01:38:37.146]  I just don't think it registers.
[01:38:37.886 --> 01:38:40.029]  But generally speaking, I think most people now... I totally agree.
[01:38:40.069 --> 01:38:40.629]  Let's go back to Trump.
[01:38:40.649 --> 01:38:41.170]  We'll go back to you.
[01:38:41.190 --> 01:38:41.550]  Here's Trump.
[01:38:43.712 --> 01:38:57.330]  When they rip down Portland, when they rip down many other cities, you go to Minnesota, Minneapolis, what they've done there with the fires all over the city, if I didn't bring in the National Guard that city would have been destroyed.
[01:38:57.951 --> 01:39:02.096]   When you look at all of the They took over big chunks of Seattle.
[01:39:02.136 --> 01:39:03.998]  I was all set to bring in the National Guard.
[01:39:04.038 --> 01:39:07.081]  They heard that, they saw them coming, and they left immediately.
[01:39:07.882 --> 01:39:11.586]  What he said about this whole subject is so off.
[01:39:12.046 --> 01:39:13.027]  Peacefully patriotic.
[01:39:13.207 --> 01:39:13.708]  One other thing.
[01:39:15.066 --> 01:39:21.528]  The unselect committee, which is basically two horrible Republicans that are all gone now out of office.
[01:39:21.548 --> 01:39:22.388]  Appointed by Democrats.
[01:39:22.688 --> 01:39:24.089]  And Democrats, all Democrats.
[01:39:24.549 --> 01:39:29.630]  They destroyed and deleted all of the information they found because they found out we were right.
[01:39:29.650 --> 01:39:30.350]  Including my testimony.
[01:39:30.370 --> 01:39:30.830]  We were right.
[01:39:31.271 --> 01:39:33.711]  And they deleted and destroyed all of the information.
[01:39:33.751 --> 01:39:35.272]  They should go to jail for that.
[01:39:35.572 --> 01:39:37.192]  If a Republican did that, they'd go to jail.
[01:39:37.212 --> 01:39:37.993]  Thank you, President Trump.
[01:39:38.033 --> 01:39:39.373]  President Biden will be here in a minute.
[01:39:39.906 --> 01:39:44.070]  The only person on this stage is a convicted felon is the man I'm looking at.
[01:39:44.411 --> 01:39:48.675]  And the fact of the matter is... And if Trump defends himself, it breaks the gag order.
[01:39:49.195 --> 01:39:56.022]  The fact is that there was no effort on his part to stop what was going on up in Capitol Hill.
[01:39:56.062 --> 01:39:59.586]  So Biden directed his Soros people to do this, and now he just called him a criminal.
[01:39:59.986 --> 01:40:01.747]  The idea that Trump's going to tear him a new asshole.
[01:40:01.787 --> 01:40:02.147]  Get ready.
[01:40:02.187 --> 01:40:03.467]  This went in and broke down doors.
[01:40:03.487 --> 01:40:04.228]  It's happening right now.
[01:40:04.248 --> 01:40:04.588]  Get ready.
[01:40:04.608 --> 01:40:05.108]  Trump's ready.
[01:40:05.628 --> 01:40:06.649]  I called offices.
[01:40:07.049 --> 01:40:08.069]  Turned over decks.
[01:40:08.089 --> 01:40:08.069]  10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[01:40:11.370 --> 01:40:12.711]  Those people are patriots?
[01:40:13.531 --> 01:40:13.911]  Come on.
[01:40:14.051 --> 01:40:15.212]  This is it.
[01:40:15.252 --> 01:40:18.733]  This is the key, right here.
[01:40:19.313 --> 01:40:21.374]  I said, will you denounce the Proud Boys?
[01:40:21.894 --> 01:40:23.215]  He said, no, I'll tell them to stand by.
[01:40:24.376 --> 01:40:34.298]  The idea he's refusing, we denounce these guys, we denounce the people we're talking about now, we denounce the people... Owen is right, no one cares about January 6th and Roblox.
[01:40:36.161 --> 01:40:40.724]  I'm going to give you a minute, President Trump, for a follow-up question I have.
[01:40:40.744 --> 01:40:41.024]  Boom!
[01:40:41.044 --> 01:40:42.625]  Didn't want Trump responding.
[01:40:42.665 --> 01:40:43.045]  There's the rigging.
[01:40:43.105 --> 01:40:43.286]  Boom!
[01:40:43.306 --> 01:40:45.127]  So Trump didn't just get to respond to that crap by Biden.
[01:40:45.147 --> 01:40:45.367]  I told you.
[01:40:45.387 --> 01:40:46.047]  That's the rigging.
[01:40:45.867 --> 01:40:50.487]   You would quote have every right to go after unquote your political opponents
[01:40:50.487 --> 01:40:53.806]   You know about so Trump didn't just get to respond to that crap
[01:40:53.806 --> 01:41:00.706]   I told you that's the rigging this is totally rigged Exactly what it means about you feeling you have every
[01:41:00.706 --> 01:41:05.846]   right to go after your political opponents Well, I said my retribution is going to be success
[01:41:05.981 --> 01:41:07.923]  We're going to make this country successful again.
[01:41:07.943 --> 01:41:09.164]  Trump shouldn't let him do that.
[01:41:09.224 --> 01:41:10.285]  He's done a great job until now.
[01:41:10.305 --> 01:41:11.766]  My retribution is going to be success.
[01:41:12.287 --> 01:41:15.570]  But when he talks about a convicted felon, his son is a convicted felon.
[01:41:16.231 --> 01:41:17.131]  At a very high level.
[01:41:17.312 --> 01:41:18.212]  His son is convicted.
[01:41:18.252 --> 01:41:20.475]  Going to be convicted probably numerous other times.
[01:41:20.955 --> 01:41:25.940]  Should have been convicted before, but his justice department let the statute of limitations lapse.
[01:41:27.381 --> 01:41:27.581]  Yes.
[01:41:27.601 --> 01:41:30.402]  But he could be a convicted felon as soon as he gets out of office.
[01:41:30.462 --> 01:41:33.583]  Joe could be a convicted felon with all of the things that he's done.
[01:41:33.883 --> 01:41:34.923]  He's done horrible things.
[01:41:35.363 --> 01:41:43.225]  All of the death cause at the border, telling the Ukrainian people that we're going to want a billion dollars or you change the prosecutor.
[01:41:43.686 --> 01:41:45.246]  Otherwise, you're not getting a billion dollars.
[01:41:45.326 --> 01:41:47.807]  If I ever said that, that's quid pro quo.
[01:41:47.827 --> 01:41:48.247]  Great job.
[01:41:49.227 --> 01:41:50.327]  We're not going to do anything.
[01:41:50.347 --> 01:41:51.008]  Trump pulled it back.
[01:41:51.048 --> 01:41:51.348]  Good, good.
[01:41:52.868 --> 01:41:53.389]  Bravo!
[01:41:53.489 --> 01:41:53.850]  Yeah!
[01:41:53.670 --> 01:41:54.670]  Bravo.
[01:41:54.670 --> 01:41:56.670]  This man is a criminal.
[01:41:56.670 --> 01:41:57.989]  This man, you're lucky.
[01:41:57.989 --> 01:41:58.989]  You're lucky.
[01:41:58.989 --> 01:41:59.989]  I did nothing wrong.
[01:41:59.989 --> 01:42:02.630]  We'd have a system that was rigged and disgusting.
[01:42:02.630 --> 01:42:03.789]  I did nothing wrong.
[01:42:03.789 --> 01:42:04.789]  Thank you, President Trump.
[01:42:04.789 --> 01:42:06.550]  President Biden, you have said...
[01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:07.550]  Hell is ass.
[01:42:07.550 --> 01:42:08.550]  Well, you want to respond?
[01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:09.550]  Go ahead.
[01:42:09.550 --> 01:42:10.949]  I'll give you a minute to respond.
[01:42:10.949 --> 01:42:16.708]   The idea that I did anything wrong relative to what you're talking about is outrageous.
[01:42:16.728 --> 01:42:17.289]  It's simply wrong.
[01:42:17.309 --> 01:42:18.210]  I'm marking it down.
[01:42:18.350 --> 01:42:24.656]  They've given Biden, so far, 40 minutes into this, five extra minutes.
[01:42:24.756 --> 01:42:25.317]  That's game.
[01:42:26.098 --> 01:42:26.738]  It's simply wrong.
[01:42:26.798 --> 01:42:28.340]  No president's ever spoken like that before.
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:29.301]  Is Trump going to respond back?
[01:42:29.321 --> 01:42:31.263]  No president in our history has spoken like that before.
[01:42:31.283 --> 01:42:33.445]  Disgusting pedophile.
[01:42:35.814 --> 01:42:39.934]   degenerate scumbag. How many billions of dollars do you owe in civil penalties for
[01:42:39.934 --> 01:42:43.733]   pedophile molesting a woman in public for doing all kinds of things. You're a pedophile.
[01:42:43.733 --> 01:42:50.454]   of having sex with a crossbar on the night your wife was pregnant. You're a pedophile.
[01:42:50.454 --> 01:42:56.134]   What are you talking about? You have the morals of an alley cat.
[01:42:56.528 --> 01:42:58.849]  I didn't have sex with a porn star, number one.
[01:42:59.330 --> 01:43:02.531]  Number two, that was a case that was started and moved.
[01:43:02.611 --> 01:43:08.374]  They moved a high-ranking official, a DOJ, into the Manhattan DA's office to start that case.
[01:43:08.814 --> 01:43:10.555]  That case is going to be appealed and won.
[01:43:11.135 --> 01:43:15.217]  We had a very terrible judge, a horrible judge, Democrat.
[01:43:15.817 --> 01:43:18.678]  The prosecutor were all high-ranking Democrats.
[01:43:18.698 --> 01:43:20.639]  Now they're going to say you violated the gag order.
[01:43:20.719 --> 01:43:22.480]  Both the civil and the criminal.
[01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:27.739]   He basically went after his political opponent because he thought it was going to damage me.
[01:43:27.739 --> 01:43:31.100]   But when the public found out about these cases, because they understand a better,
[01:43:31.100 --> 01:43:33.420]  he has no idea what these cases are.
[01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:36.619]   But what he did when they found out about these cases, you know what they did?
[01:43:36.619 --> 01:43:38.220]  My poll numbers went up way up.
[01:43:38.220 --> 01:43:40.380]  You know that because you're reporting 600 million months.
[01:43:40.396 --> 01:43:45.356]   We've taken more money in the last two weeks than we've ever taken in the history of any
[01:43:45.356 --> 01:43:46.356]  campaign.
[01:43:46.356 --> 01:43:51.235]   I don't think any campaign has ever taken hundreds of millions of dollars to get here
[01:43:51.235 --> 01:43:55.957]   because the public knows it's a scam and it's a guy that's after his political opponent
[01:43:55.957 --> 01:43:58.836]  because he can't win fair and square.
[01:43:58.853 --> 01:44:05.880]  President Biden, you have said, quote, Donald Trump and his MAGA Republicans are determined to destroy American democracy.
[01:44:06.341 --> 01:44:13.929]  Do you believe that the tens of millions of Americans who are likely to vote for President Trump will be voting against American democracy?
[01:44:14.733 --> 01:44:17.494]  More they know about what he's done, yes.
[01:44:17.534 --> 01:44:19.455]  More they know about what he's done.
[01:44:19.495 --> 01:44:20.615]  He's got a lot more coming.
[01:44:20.635 --> 01:44:22.716]  He's got a lot of cases down the road coming around.
[01:44:23.196 --> 01:44:25.357]  He's got a whole range of cases.
[01:44:25.497 --> 01:44:28.158]  I don't know what the juries will do.
[01:44:28.638 --> 01:44:30.619]  But I do know he has a real problem.
[01:44:31.099 --> 01:44:36.461]  And so the fact that he gave us the QA in front of the state, that has some retribution.
[01:44:37.041 --> 01:44:38.041]  Never said that, you liar.
[01:44:37.862 --> 01:44:42.862]   say that I thought Hitler had some good ideas. What got me involved in the first place is
[01:44:42.862 --> 01:44:48.021]   my son had died. I decided in Iraq, because of Iraq, I said I wasn't going to run again
[01:44:48.021 --> 01:44:50.902]  until I saw what happened in Charlottesville, Virginia.
[01:44:50.902 --> 01:44:56.462]   People coming out of the woods carrying swastikas on torches, torches, and singing the same anti-Semitic
[01:44:56.462 --> 01:45:01.622]   ballad they sang when the American government...
[01:45:01.652 --> 01:45:02.713]  And a young woman got killed.
[01:45:02.773 --> 01:45:03.634]  I spoke to the mother.
[01:45:04.174 --> 01:45:07.917]  And they asked him, they said, what do you think of those people?
[01:45:08.278 --> 01:45:10.920]  When no one's right, nobody's buying this lie.
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:13.362]  And the ones he said, I think they're fine people.
[01:45:13.462 --> 01:45:16.425]  No, he said, more lies.
[01:45:16.926 --> 01:45:24.612]  Whatever say, Nazis coming out of fields, carrying torches, singing the same anti-Semitic bile, carrying swastikas.
[01:45:25.273 --> 01:45:26.073]  We're fine people.
[01:45:26.814 --> 01:45:29.035]  This is a guy who says Hitler's done some good things.
[01:45:29.415 --> 01:45:30.415]  I'd like to know what they are.
[01:45:30.435 --> 01:45:32.636]  The good things Hitler's done, that's what he said.
[01:45:33.096 --> 01:45:35.357]  This guy has no sense of American democracy.
[01:45:37.526 --> 01:45:41.009]  Jake, both of you know that sir has been totally wiped out.
[01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:46.114]  Because when you see the sentence, it said 100% exoneration on this.
[01:45:46.134 --> 01:45:48.657]  So he just- Even Stokes says Trump didn't say that.
[01:45:48.837 --> 01:45:50.399]  He didn't run because of Charlottesville.
[01:45:50.859 --> 01:45:52.661]  He ran because it was his last chance.
[01:45:53.682 --> 01:45:55.083]  He's not equipped to be president.
[01:45:55.183 --> 01:45:56.144]  You know it and I know it.
[01:45:56.204 --> 01:45:56.825]  It's ridiculous.
[01:45:56.865 --> 01:45:57.445]  We have a debate.
[01:45:57.846 --> 01:45:59.948]  We're trying to justify his presidency.
[01:46:00.388 --> 01:46:07.214]   His presidency, he's- Without question, the worst president, the worst presidency in the history of our country.
[01:46:07.654 --> 01:46:09.315]  We shouldn't be having a debate about it.
[01:46:09.355 --> 01:46:10.416]  There's nothing to debate.
[01:46:10.796 --> 01:46:12.477]  He made up the Charlottesville story.
[01:46:12.797 --> 01:46:15.039]  And you'll see it's debunked all over the place.
[01:46:15.499 --> 01:46:19.202]  Every anchor, every reasonable anchor has debunked it.
[01:46:19.642 --> 01:46:22.704]  And just the other day it came out where it was fully debunked.
[01:46:23.245 --> 01:46:25.006]  It's a nonsense story.
[01:46:26.167 --> 01:46:27.648]  He didn't run because of Charlottesville.
[01:46:27.668 --> 01:46:29.089]  He used that as an excuse to run.
[01:46:30.299 --> 01:46:30.740]  President Biden.
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:31.501]  And debunked.
[01:46:31.521 --> 01:46:33.643]  And now that Biden's gonna talk, let's play Ludacris right now.
[01:46:33.663 --> 01:46:35.165]  He was listening to what we said at the time.
[01:46:35.906 --> 01:46:38.950]  And the idea that somehow that's... Move, bitch!
[01:46:39.972 --> 01:46:40.993]  Get out the way!
[01:46:41.394 --> 01:46:46.200]  He thought there were people coming out of that office... Move, bitch!
[01:46:46.039 --> 01:46:55.039]   Get out the way, get out the way, bitch, get out the way Move, bitch, get out the way, bitch, get out the way
[01:46:55.039 --> 01:47:00.039]   Move, bitch, get out the way, get out the way, bitch, get out the way
[01:47:00.039 --> 01:47:06.039]   Move, bitch, get out the way, get out the way, bitch, get out the way
[01:47:06.039 --> 01:47:16.149]   Oh no, the fight's out, I'm 'bout to punch your lights out Get the fuck back, guard your grill, it's somethin' wrong,
[01:47:16.149 --> 01:47:21.130]   we can't stay still I've been drinkin' and fussin' too, and I've been thinkin'
[01:47:21.130 --> 01:47:25.609]   of fussin' you Upside the motherfuckin' bowhead, and if your friend's a
[01:47:25.609 --> 01:47:32.039]   bitch, I'll burn I've been drinkin' and fussin' too, and I've been thinkin'
[01:47:32.039 --> 01:47:37.759]   of fussin' you Trump just did 45 minutes and knocked the living hell out of Biden.
[01:47:38.619 --> 01:47:39.940]  All the questions are anti-Trump.
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:41.841]  They shaved six, seven minutes off Trump.
[01:47:42.441 --> 01:47:47.064]  But despite all the rigging, let's not watch their ad.
[01:47:47.104 --> 01:47:48.425]  Let's go back to the Ludacris song.
[01:47:48.404 --> 01:47:51.404]  Go keep rolling. (laughing)
[01:47:51.404 --> 01:47:54.425]   ♪ Get out the way, get out the way bitch ♪ ♪ Get out the way ♪
[01:47:54.425 --> 01:47:56.123]  You hear them headlights?
[01:47:56.123 --> 01:47:57.923]  I'm DUI, I never pull over.
[01:47:58.198 --> 01:48:00.198]  Better move the fuck over!
[01:48:01.198 --> 01:48:02.198]  Ha ha ha!

[01:49:14.572 --> 01:49:15.733]  Get out the way.
[01:49:15.813 --> 01:49:17.273]  You know I'm on the right track.
[01:49:17.313 --> 01:49:18.614]  B got the white Mack.
[01:49:18.694 --> 01:49:20.275]  Hit the trunk, grab the pom-pom.
[01:49:20.415 --> 01:49:21.296]  I'll be right back.
[01:49:21.356 --> 01:49:24.038]  We buyin' bars out, showin' stars out.
[01:49:24.078 --> 01:49:26.399]  We heard it's hoes out, so we brought the cars out.
[01:49:26.439 --> 01:49:27.039]  Come on, Tick.
[01:49:27.099 --> 01:49:28.840]  Grab the pills, cause we poppin' tonight.
[01:49:29.121 --> 01:49:31.562]  Beat the shit out of security for stoppin' the fight.
[01:49:31.761 --> 01:49:36.961]   I got a fifth of that Remy, fuck a Belgian Chris I'm selling shit up in the club like I'm working at bitch
[01:49:36.961 --> 01:49:39.761]   Fuck the dress code In street clothes, we on street niggas
[01:49:39.761 --> 01:49:43.161]   We on the dance floor, throwing bowls Beating up niggas, I'm from the deck
[01:49:43.161 --> 01:49:47.761]   Try to disrespect DTP And watch the bottle start flying from the VIP
[01:49:47.761 --> 01:49:50.561]   Fuck this rap shit We clap bitch, you on your bike
[01:49:50.561 --> 01:49:53.161]   Grab your folks, start a fight Don't ruin the party
[01:49:53.161 --> 01:49:56.761]   So move bitch, get out your way Hoes, all you faggots
[01:49:56.761 --> 01:50:01.561]   Motherfuckers, they wait for too old So move bitch, get out the way
[01:50:01.561 --> 01:50:06.961]   Get out the way bitch, get out the way Move bitch, get out the way
[01:50:06.961 --> 01:50:11.362]   Get out the way bitch, get out the way We played that before we beat Hillary
[01:50:11.362 --> 01:50:13.362]  Get out the way.
[01:50:12.620 --> 01:50:13.661]  So many years ago.
[01:50:14.842 --> 01:50:16.424]  Almost eight years ago, folks.
[01:50:17.425 --> 01:50:18.807]  And we're just saying, get out the way.
[01:50:18.907 --> 01:50:19.428]  We're done.
[01:50:19.748 --> 01:50:23.272]  Let's go back to their stupid mattress commercials on CNN.
[01:50:23.332 --> 01:50:25.215]  I mean, CNN has no viewers until now.
[01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:27.360]  Let's go back.
[01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:28.160]  Whoever wants to jump on.
[01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:30.521]  Harrison, Owen, Chase.
[01:50:30.561 --> 01:50:31.621]  Fade down the mattress commercial.
[01:50:31.661 --> 01:50:32.661]  You guys want to comment on this?
[01:50:32.981 --> 01:50:34.362]  Yeah, well, it's Biden nap time.
[01:50:35.082 --> 01:50:38.082]  This mattress commercial is brought to you by a good Biden nap.
[01:50:38.623 --> 01:50:40.623]  So they had to make sure to squeeze in a Biden nap time.
[01:50:41.363 --> 01:50:42.643]  Ludacris is from Atlanta.
[01:50:42.863 --> 01:50:43.884]  The debate is in Atlanta.
[01:50:43.924 --> 01:50:47.484]  So that's very, that's some local color there, Alex.
[01:50:51.966 --> 01:50:53.368]  No, keep going.
[01:50:54.269 --> 01:50:59.574]  Well, I would just say that, you know, there's no doubt Biden has gotten more time.
[01:50:59.594 --> 01:51:03.638]  I think I mean, I don't have the I'm not with a clicker, but I think Alex is probably right.
[01:51:03.658 --> 01:51:05.701]  I think he's probably gotten about five extra minutes.
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.403]  I think though Trump has kind of allowed that to happen strategically.
[01:51:11.324 --> 01:51:19.931]  I think that Trump has allowed that strategically where he's just putting out concise responses and then just saying, go ahead Joe, go ahead and talk more.
[01:51:19.951 --> 01:51:21.813]  Because it's just not working.
[01:51:22.013 --> 01:51:25.216]  It's just, I don't think Biden is winning any voters tonight.
[01:51:25.256 --> 01:51:27.418]  So I think strategically that's going on.
[01:51:27.458 --> 01:51:28.499]  Is this them back live guys?
[01:51:29.159 --> 01:51:29.379]  Yeah.
[01:51:29.199 --> 01:51:30.199]  Yeah.
[01:51:30.199 --> 01:51:31.199]  All right, we're about to go back to your live.
[01:51:31.199 --> 01:51:36.519]   Black voters are still three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes, and
[01:51:36.519 --> 01:51:42.038]   black Americans are imprisoned at five times the rate of white Americans.
[01:51:42.038 --> 01:51:44.919]   What do you say to black voters who are disappointed that you have a...
[01:51:44.919 --> 01:51:46.439]  Yeah, these questions are all rigged.
[01:51:46.455 --> 01:51:48.297]  It's all leftist talking points.
[01:51:48.417 --> 01:51:54.063]  That's how they're rigging us with questions.
[01:51:54.423 --> 01:52:03.992]  By the way, I sent you the clip this morning again of him saying, if you are black, can I catch you with one little piece of crack 20 years in prison next to a sun-smoking crack?
[01:52:04.933 --> 01:52:05.754]  Can we get that footage?
[01:52:05.774 --> 01:52:12.962]  Just type in, Biden talks about crack smoking on X. I said to you this morning again, I said to you yesterday, chew that up.
[01:52:13.002 --> 01:52:17.687]  Because if you want to just get Biden folks, them giving him more time, all the cheating, go see the feed with them.
[01:52:17.747 --> 01:52:18.789]  We're here giving commentary.
[01:52:19.841 --> 01:52:21.182]  We're like, move, bitch!
[01:52:21.522 --> 01:52:22.543]  Get out the way!
[01:52:22.823 --> 01:52:23.964]  Get out the way, bitch!
[01:52:24.024 --> 01:52:24.964]  Move out the way!
[01:52:25.304 --> 01:52:26.265]  Move, bitch!
[01:52:26.565 --> 01:52:27.506]  Get out the way!
[01:52:27.766 --> 01:52:28.867]  Get out the way, bitch!
[01:52:28.907 --> 01:52:29.827]  Get out the way!
[01:52:30.508 --> 01:52:33.410]  We don't want your World War III.
[01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:35.951]  We don't want your triple the prices.
[01:52:36.011 --> 01:52:37.632]  We don't want your New World Order.
[01:52:37.852 --> 01:52:39.493]  We don't want your drag queen story time.
[01:52:39.734 --> 01:52:40.754]  We don't want your Royal Garment.
[01:52:40.774 --> 01:52:42.615]  We don't want the military wearing red high heels.
[01:52:42.896 --> 01:52:43.856]  We reject it all.
[01:52:44.216 --> 01:52:44.877]  Move, bitch!
[01:52:45.197 --> 01:52:46.017]  Get out the way!
[01:52:46.398 --> 01:52:47.378]  Get out the way, bitch!
[01:52:47.438 --> 01:52:48.099]  Move out the way!
[01:52:49.431 --> 01:52:52.494]  Find that clip of him saying blacks are predators, put them all in prison.
[01:52:52.714 --> 01:52:53.655]  I mean, just fuck him.
[01:52:54.075 --> 01:52:55.476]  I mean, Trump never said that shit.
[01:52:55.496 --> 01:52:59.760]  I'm not going to listen to this KKK leader run his mouth anymore.
[01:52:59.820 --> 01:53:01.922]  Go back to this crackhead pedophile.
[01:53:01.982 --> 01:53:05.445]  Go back to that crackhead pedophile and the CIA whore talking to him.
[01:53:06.345 --> 01:53:10.747]  Let's give the son of a bitch like three minutes.
[01:53:11.308 --> 01:53:12.468]  Goes on and on and on.
[01:53:12.508 --> 01:53:13.489]  I've been marking it down.
[01:53:13.849 --> 01:53:15.390]  He's got like seven minutes extra.
[01:53:15.410 --> 01:53:16.430]  Oh yeah, he loves black people, folks.
[01:53:16.450 --> 01:53:17.070]  Loves killing them.
[01:53:16.930 --> 01:53:22.210]   credit to be able to... He loves black people folks, loves killing them. I made sure that we're in a
[01:53:22.210 --> 01:53:27.570]   situation where all those black families and those black individuals who provided to have to take out
[01:53:27.570 --> 01:53:34.050]   student loans that were... That's sitting in the pool with the black cockroaches and they...
[01:53:34.219 --> 01:53:35.339]  We're going to let Trump respond.
[01:53:35.179 --> 01:53:39.978]   having to do with volunteerism. If they paid their bills for 10 years and their
[01:53:39.978 --> 01:53:43.658]   student debt all the rest is forgiven. You know what, we're gonna let Trump respond.
[01:53:43.658 --> 01:53:50.458]   I'm gonna play one of his crack cocaine comments. Shut up pedophile!
[01:53:49.255 --> 01:53:51.476]  Shut up, you degenerate pedophile!
[01:53:51.736 --> 01:53:54.957]  He's blaming inflation, and he's right, it's been very bad.
[01:53:55.638 --> 01:54:00.440]  He caused the inflation, and it's killing black families, and Hispanic families, and just about everybody.
[01:54:00.460 --> 01:54:03.001]  He's the one cutting the energy off, that's what causes inflation.
[01:54:03.061 --> 01:54:08.224]  When you cut the goddamn energy off, that causes the inflation, that's the number one thing.
[01:54:09.364 --> 01:54:10.125]  They can't live.
[01:54:10.385 --> 01:54:11.546]  They're not living anymore.
[01:54:11.846 --> 01:54:18.050]  That's how Trump can increase spending but have lower taxes because the energy was cheaper.
[01:54:18.370 --> 01:54:19.050]  Dumbass.
[01:54:19.371 --> 01:54:20.591]  That's what everything is.
[01:54:20.652 --> 01:54:23.313]  The fuel and the electricity and the fertilizer.
[01:54:23.673 --> 01:54:25.074]  It's energy, dumbass.
[01:54:25.154 --> 01:54:26.736]  Money that's being thrown out the window.
[01:54:27.196 --> 01:54:28.317]  He caused inflation.
[01:54:28.717 --> 01:54:38.503]   As sure as you're sitting there, The fact is that his big kill on the black people is the millions of people that he's allowed to come in through the border.
[01:54:38.523 --> 01:54:52.552]  They're taking black jobs now, and it could be 18, it could be 19, and even 20 million people are taking black jobs, and they're taking Hispanic jobs, and you haven't seen it yet, but you're going to see something that's going to be the worst in our history.
[01:54:52.632 --> 01:54:53.833]  Thank you, President Biden.
[01:54:54.841 --> 01:54:56.122]  There was no inflation.
[01:54:56.503 --> 01:55:00.947]  By the way, you just saw Biden get 3 minutes, Trump just got 60 seconds.
[01:55:00.967 --> 01:55:04.971]  So now Biden's 10 minutes ahead of Trump, or 9 minutes.
[01:55:05.231 --> 01:55:07.053]  I mean, I'm watching this.
[01:55:07.093 --> 01:55:08.114]  You're watching it too, right?
[01:55:08.134 --> 01:55:10.597]  That's why I'm talking over him.
[01:55:10.556 --> 01:55:12.556]  The son of a bitch is talking the whole time!
[01:55:12.556 --> 01:55:15.556]   ...individuals who are involved communities including minority communities.
[01:55:15.556 --> 01:55:17.556]  We made sure that they have health insurance.
[01:55:17.556 --> 01:55:19.556]  Move bitch!
[01:55:20.045 --> 01:55:22.025]  Oh, blacks need to take the shot.
[01:55:22.246 --> 01:55:23.086]  We shouldn't take it.
[01:55:23.106 --> 01:55:24.006]  Let the blacks take it.
[01:55:24.046 --> 01:55:24.646]  I love you.
[01:55:24.666 --> 01:55:29.268]  If you don't vote for me, you ain't black.
[01:55:29.868 --> 01:55:31.829]  Move, bitch.
[01:55:32.129 --> 01:55:33.109]  Get out the way.
[01:55:33.430 --> 01:55:34.490]  Get out the way, bitch.
[01:55:34.530 --> 01:55:34.950]  Get out the way.
[01:55:35.150 --> 01:55:36.851]  Does he ever shut the fuck up?
[01:55:37.691 --> 01:55:41.592]  He's been going on for fucking, I mean, that's like 15 minutes more now.
[01:55:41.992 --> 01:55:42.653]  Shut up!
[01:55:42.673 --> 01:55:46.254]  I mean, serious folks, I'm keeping score right here.
[01:55:47.134 --> 01:55:49.935]  It's over 10 minutes extra of this guy in less than an hour.
[01:55:50.195 --> 01:55:51.715]  Trump, you now get 10 seconds.
[01:55:51.735 --> 01:55:53.036]  Biden, you get 3 minutes.
[01:55:57.877 --> 01:55:59.258]  Trump, you get one minute.
[01:55:59.378 --> 01:56:02.000]  Biden, you get four minutes.
[01:56:02.020 --> 01:56:03.241]  Oh, the climate crisis.
[01:56:03.441 --> 01:56:04.682]  Yeah, cut off the power.
[01:56:04.742 --> 01:56:07.364]  It is not the hottest year in recorded history.
[01:56:07.424 --> 01:56:08.444]  You're lying.
[01:56:08.484 --> 01:56:08.865]  Draw it.
[01:56:08.704 --> 01:56:12.484]  hottest year in recorded history you lying fraud.
[01:56:12.484 --> 01:56:17.024]  Intensifying wildfires stronger hurricanes.
[01:56:17.024 --> 01:56:20.984]  Former President Trump.
[01:56:19.004 --> 01:56:19.905]  This debate is rigged as hell.
[01:56:19.925 --> 01:56:21.806]  Just because Trump's doing good.
[01:56:21.645 --> 01:56:23.645]  But this debate is rigged as hell.
[01:56:23.645 --> 01:56:25.645]  As president to slow the climate crisis.
[01:56:25.645 --> 01:56:26.645]  Justice Trump's doing good.
[01:56:26.645 --> 01:56:29.645]  Let me just go back to what he said about the police.
[01:56:29.645 --> 01:56:31.645]  How close the police are to him.
[01:56:31.645 --> 01:56:33.645]  Almost every police group in the nation...
[01:56:33.645 --> 01:56:35.645]  I noticed they never let him respond to the last question.
[01:56:35.645 --> 01:56:38.645]  ...is supporting Donald J. Trump.
[01:56:38.997 --> 01:56:40.298]  Almost every police group.
[01:56:40.999 --> 01:56:47.184]  And what he's done to the black population is horrible, including the fact that for 10 years he called them super predators.
[01:56:47.224 --> 01:56:49.226]  We can't, in the 1990s, we can't forget that.
[01:56:49.606 --> 01:56:55.411]  Super predators was his name, and he called it to them for 10, and they've taken great offense at it, and now they see it happening.
[01:56:56.072 --> 01:57:05.018]  But when they see what I did for criminal justice reform, and for the historically black colleges and universities, where I funded them and got them all funded.
[01:57:05.038 --> 01:57:05.699]  Double funded?
[01:57:05.719 --> 01:57:08.841]  The Opportunity Zones with Tim, as you know.
[01:57:08.881 --> 01:57:10.442]  Tim Scott was incredible.
[01:57:10.462 --> 01:57:11.303]  He did a great job.
[01:57:11.643 --> 01:57:13.404]  Great senator from South Carolina.
[01:57:13.845 --> 01:57:15.946]  He came to me with the idea and it was a great idea.
[01:57:15.966 --> 01:57:19.969]  It's one of the most successful economic development acts ever in the country.
[01:57:20.089 --> 01:57:20.990]  Opportunity Zones.
[01:57:21.630 --> 01:57:23.651]  And the biggest beneficiary are blacks.
[01:57:23.751 --> 01:57:28.772]  And that's why we have the best numbers with them in maybe ever.
[01:57:28.892 --> 01:57:29.632]  They're saying ever.
[01:57:29.672 --> 01:57:38.435]  I read this morning where ever the best numbers he's lost much of the black population because he's done a horrible job for black people.
[01:57:38.695 --> 01:57:41.495]  He's also done a horrible job for Hispanics.
[01:57:41.735 --> 01:57:50.158]  But when you see these millions of people pouring into our country and they're going to take the jobs and it's already started and you haven't seen anything yet, it's a disaster.
[01:57:51.379 --> 01:57:53.226]  38 seconds left, President Trump.
[01:57:53.306 --> 01:57:57.521]  Will you take any action as president to slow the climate crisis?
[01:57:58.392 --> 01:58:04.818]  I want absolutely immaculate, clean water, and I want absolutely clean air, and we had it.
[01:58:05.298 --> 01:58:14.046]  We had H2O, we had the best numbers ever, and we did, we were using... All the plants put out is CO2 and water.
[01:58:14.466 --> 01:58:24.715]  And yet, during my four years, I had the best environmental numbers ever, and my top environmental people gave me that statistic just before I walked on the stage, actually.
[01:58:26.693 --> 01:58:27.954]  I don't know where the hell he's been.
[01:58:28.754 --> 01:58:31.396]  The idea that Andy he said is true.
[01:58:31.936 --> 01:58:33.877]  He's a fuckin' pedophile.
[01:58:33.957 --> 01:58:34.437]  Fuck you.
[01:58:34.537 --> 01:58:37.539]  Most extensive climate change legislation in history.
[01:58:37.759 --> 01:58:39.640]  You gotta cut off all our energy and kill us?
[01:58:40.061 --> 01:58:42.602]  While China makes no cuts in Mexico and India?
[01:58:42.842 --> 01:58:46.044]  And all our jobs go to you lying sack of crap?
[01:58:46.084 --> 01:58:47.985]  Here, let's hear him on crack.
[01:58:48.285 --> 01:58:49.046]  Play the crack clip.
[01:58:49.086 --> 01:58:50.747]  Here it is.
[01:58:51.487 --> 01:58:56.924]   If you have a piece of Crack cocaine.
[01:58:58.167 --> 01:59:01.292]  No bigger than this quarter that I'm holding in my hand.
[01:59:01.874 --> 01:59:03.076]  One quarter of one dollar.
[01:59:04.013 --> 01:59:07.796]  We passed a law through the leadership of Senator Thurman and myself and others.
[01:59:08.457 --> 01:59:15.383]  A law that says, if you're caught with that, you go to jail for five years.
[01:59:16.083 --> 01:59:17.705]  You get no probation.
[01:59:18.505 --> 01:59:23.269]  You get nothing other than five years in jail.
[01:59:23.850 --> 01:59:25.231]  Judge doesn't have a choice.
[01:59:25.651 --> 01:59:31.856]  Under our forfeiture statutes, you can, the government can, take everything you own.
[01:59:32.737 --> 01:59:44.746]  Everything from your car to your house, your bank account, not merely what they confiscate in terms of the dollars from the transaction that you just got caught engaging in.
[01:59:44.766 --> 01:59:46.147]  They can take everything.
[01:59:46.387 --> 01:59:48.769]  I don't care why they've become a sociopath.
[01:59:49.429 --> 01:59:53.853]  We have an obligation to cordon them off from the rest of society.
[01:59:54.173 --> 01:59:55.434]  They are in jail.
[01:59:57.395 --> 02:00:01.239]  Away from my mother, your husband, our families.
[02:00:01.379 --> 02:00:05.623]  So I don't want to ask, what made them do this?
[02:00:06.303 --> 02:00:08.946]  They must be taken off the street.
[02:00:08.966 --> 02:00:13.230]  We'll get you to the Super Frontier Club, but back to Trump.
[02:00:14.491 --> 02:00:18.354]  ...over our schools, our hospitals, and they're going to be taking over Social Security.
[02:00:18.715 --> 02:00:22.198]  He is destroying Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
[02:00:25.521 --> 02:00:27.922]  Back to the pedophile.
[02:00:28.243 --> 02:00:30.704]  The fact is, I raped my daughter in the shower.
[02:00:30.744 --> 02:00:33.766]  The fact is, I'm a Russian-Chinese agent.
[02:00:34.306 --> 02:00:36.107]  The fact is, I shit my pants every day.
[02:00:36.127 --> 02:00:37.688]  The fact is, I surveil the American people.
[02:00:37.707 --> 02:00:40.397]  United States. Fact is I surveilled the American people.
[02:00:40.397 --> 02:00:45.976]   One of the largest polluters in the world, number one. We're making significant progress. By 2035 we
[02:00:45.976 --> 02:00:48.027]  will have cut pollution in half.
[02:00:48.027 --> 02:00:52.587]   We have made, we have made significant. They call carbon that you breathe, that you exhale.
[02:00:52.587 --> 02:00:57.226]   We set up a climate corps for thousands of young people will learn how to deal with climate, just
[02:00:57.226 --> 02:01:02.027]   like the Peace Corps. And we're going to, we're moving in directions that are going to significantly
[02:01:02.027 --> 02:01:08.827]   change the elements of cause of pollution. But the idea that he claims that he has the biggest
[02:01:08.827 --> 02:01:14.426]   heart up here and he's really concerned about, about pollution and about climate.
[02:01:14.624 --> 02:01:30.894]  I've not seen any indication of that and by the way with regard to Prescription drugs getting rid of cows doesn't save the earth that they would reduce the price to $35 which I was calling for one voluntarily I made sure every company in the world every pleasure.
[02:01:30.934 --> 02:01:39.351]   We've got away And by the way So every day, millions of Americans struggle just to make ends meet.
[02:01:39.431 --> 02:01:43.353]  For many older Americans, Social Security provides a critical lifeline.
[02:01:43.373 --> 02:01:44.634]  So these questions are all rigged.
[02:01:44.674 --> 02:01:46.636]  Nothing is done to Social Security.
[02:01:46.716 --> 02:01:51.019]  Seniors will see their benefits cut in just over 10 years.
[02:01:51.499 --> 02:01:56.703]  Will you name tonight one specific step that you're willing to take to keep Social Security solvent?
[02:01:56.863 --> 02:01:59.424]  Yes, make the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share.
[02:02:00.045 --> 02:02:01.005]  They never do.
[02:02:01.045 --> 02:02:01.966]  They all run him.
[02:02:02.386 --> 02:02:04.127]  Biden's been giving all the billionaire money.
[02:02:04.187 --> 02:02:05.048]  Trump got none of that.
[02:02:05.368 --> 02:02:06.168]  They're all exempt.
[02:02:06.188 --> 02:02:06.909]  It's all a lie.
[02:02:07.249 --> 02:02:16.254]  Every single time they get a paycheck from the time, the first one they get when they're 18 years old, the idea that they're going to... Let's hear a racial jungle clip from Biden.
[02:02:16.294 --> 02:02:17.014]  We'll go back to Trump.
[02:02:18.235 --> 02:02:18.915]  Millionaires pay 1%.
[02:02:19.796 --> 02:02:22.357]  We keep talking about this thing as being North versus South.
[02:02:22.397 --> 02:02:23.198]  That's not the issue.
[02:02:23.838 --> 02:02:25.019]  It is rural versus urban.
[02:02:25.692 --> 02:02:31.658]  And most of the busing that's taken place to date has taken place in rural areas, whether it be administratively ordered or court ordered.
[02:02:32.318 --> 02:02:36.122]  Now we're moving into applying the same standards to urban areas.
[02:02:36.562 --> 02:02:38.524]  And it is a standard that doesn't make sense.
[02:02:38.724 --> 02:02:39.665]  It doesn't apply.
[02:02:39.685 --> 02:02:40.626]  It doesn't hold.
[02:02:41.006 --> 02:02:48.193]  We're moving from trying to, in urban areas we've had integrated facilities, but segregated neighborhoods.
[02:02:48.897 --> 02:02:53.398]  And in rural areas, we've traditionally had integrated neighborhoods, but segregated facilities.
[02:02:53.919 --> 02:02:55.959]  And they've applied the same standard and the same test.
[02:02:56.319 --> 02:02:58.580]  So this North-South thing is not really the issue.
[02:02:58.940 --> 02:03:10.704]  As Professor Nathan Glazer at Harvard has indicated, as Dr. Armour of the RAND Corporation, as James Coleman, as... I just held three days of hearings, two days of hearings in the Judiciary Committee on another bill I have.
[02:03:10.744 --> 02:03:12.044]  Beyond this, it deals with busing.
[02:03:12.704 --> 02:03:23.776]  No matter what your intent, there are going to be those who say it's a segregated thing, it's a question of race, and that you have set back the movement of desegregation of schools.
[02:03:23.615 --> 02:03:31.375]   who say it's a segregated thing, it's a question of race, and that you have set back the movement
[02:03:31.375 --> 02:03:33.295]  of desegregation of schools.
[02:03:33.295 --> 02:03:34.295]  How would you answer that?
[02:03:34.295 --> 02:03:39.975]   The way I answer that is I predict that the young black leadership of America will overwhelmingly
[02:03:39.975 --> 02:03:41.135]  decide with me.
[02:03:41.090 --> 02:03:49.153]  I predict that in 1980 and 84 my position will be totally vindicated by the sociologists and by civil rights activists.
[02:03:49.173 --> 02:03:51.374]  He's gonna come back and call blacks jungle people.
[02:03:51.775 --> 02:03:52.675]  We'll get to that clip in a minute.
[02:03:52.695 --> 02:03:54.356]  Look at what a little slimy lawyer he is.
[02:03:54.396 --> 02:03:58.497]  But let's go back to Trump's about to... Notice Biden just gets endless times while I'm interrupting him.
[02:03:58.758 --> 02:03:59.658]  Here's Trump now responding.
[02:03:59.718 --> 02:04:04.260]  In my life, I've been on this side of the equation for the last eight years.
[02:04:05.721 --> 02:04:07.582]  I've never seen anybody lie like this guy.
[02:04:08.062 --> 02:04:08.542]  He lies.
[02:04:08.622 --> 02:04:12.664]  I've never seen if he could look you in the face, but so many other things, too.
[02:04:13.465 --> 02:04:14.725]  And we mentioned the laptop.
[02:04:14.765 --> 02:04:17.747]  We mentioned Russia, Russia, Russia, Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine.
[02:04:17.927 --> 02:04:19.507]  Everything he does is a lie.
[02:04:19.908 --> 02:04:22.269]  It's misinformation and disinformation.
[02:04:23.409 --> 02:04:27.391]  The losers and suckers story that he made up is a total lie on the military.
[02:04:27.891 --> 02:04:28.632]  It's a disgrace.
[02:04:29.212 --> 02:04:42.517]  But Social Security, he's destroying it, because millions of people are pouring into our country, and they're putting them onto Social Security, they're putting them onto Medicare, Medicaid, they're putting them in our hospitals, they're taking the place of our citizens.
[02:04:42.537 --> 02:04:43.257]  He's bankrupting everything.
[02:04:43.357 --> 02:04:46.539]  What they're doing to the VA, to our veterans, is unbelievable.
[02:04:46.559 --> 02:04:50.440]  Our veterans are living on the street, and these people are living in luxury hotels.
[02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:54.642]  He doesn't know what he's doing, and it's really coming back.
[02:04:54.822 --> 02:04:57.683]  I've never seen such anger in our country before.
[02:04:58.541 --> 02:04:59.021]  President Biden?
[02:04:59.561 --> 02:05:01.062]  God, Biden just talked for three minutes!
[02:05:01.082 --> 02:05:01.622]  He's talking again!
[02:05:01.642 --> 02:05:03.223]  Alright, back to the racial jungle video.
[02:05:03.103 --> 02:05:08.942]   By the way, when I said "suck my dick" he said he acknowledged after that he fired that general.
[02:05:08.942 --> 02:05:13.422]   That general got fired because he's the one that acknowledged that that's what he said.
[02:05:13.422 --> 02:05:14.462]  He was the one standing with Trump.
[02:05:14.462 --> 02:05:15.983]  Alright, back to the racial jungle video.
[02:05:15.983 --> 02:05:17.422]  Number one. Number two.
[02:05:17.422 --> 02:05:17.903]  Another Biden.
[02:05:17.903 --> 02:05:19.822]  The idea that we're going to be in a situation where...
[02:05:19.822 --> 02:05:22.703]  I come from that side of the track. That's where I'm from.
[02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:24.441]  I was a defense lawyer.
[02:05:24.581 --> 02:05:25.841]  I handle civil rights cases.
[02:05:25.921 --> 02:05:27.102]  I sat in on Route 40.
[02:05:27.162 --> 02:05:29.583]  I mean, you know, I'm not from the other side of this.
[02:05:30.643 --> 02:05:37.585]  And I happen to think that the one way to ensure that you set the civil rights movement in America further back is to continue to push busing.
[02:05:38.245 --> 02:05:39.726]  Because it's a bankrupt policy.
[02:05:41.720 --> 02:05:43.721]  And that's why I think I'll be vindicated.
[02:05:43.961 --> 02:05:46.583]  I don't include myself with pro or anti-busing force.
[02:05:46.643 --> 02:05:53.127]  I think the only group that can determine whether or not a constitutional violation exists is the Federal Courts of the United States of America.
[02:05:53.507 --> 02:05:54.708]  No one else has that right.
[02:05:54.808 --> 02:06:06.114]   Secondly, a Federal Court of the United States of America determining a violation of the Constitution with regard to school desegregation cases must find that there is a specific intent to segregate before they
[02:06:06.114 --> 02:06:06.473]  can...
[02:06:06.473 --> 02:06:12.154]   All right, we're going to go back to the urban jungle point about blacks, but let's go back to CNN.
[02:06:12.154 --> 02:06:15.114]  $5,000 a year per child for many families.
[02:06:15.114 --> 02:06:19.274]   The cost of child care for two children is more than their rent.
[02:06:19.274 --> 02:06:22.874]   In your second term, what would you do to make child care more affordable?
[02:06:22.874 --> 02:06:28.554]   Just to go back, the general got fired because he was no good.
[02:06:28.765 --> 02:06:30.547]  And if he said that, that's why he made it up.
[02:06:30.587 --> 02:06:35.213]  But we have 19 people that said I didn't say it, and they're very highly respected, much more so than him.
[02:06:35.954 --> 02:06:39.097]  The other thing is, he doesn't fire people.
[02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:41.040]  He never fired people.
[02:06:41.260 --> 02:06:42.461]  I've never seen him fire anybody.
[02:06:42.521 --> 02:06:43.221]  I did fire a lot.
[02:06:43.261 --> 02:06:44.782]  I fired Comey because he was no good.
[02:06:44.822 --> 02:06:47.843]  I fired a lot of the top people at the FBI, drained the swamp.
[02:06:48.123 --> 02:06:48.803]  They were no good.
[02:06:49.203 --> 02:06:50.304]  Not easy to fire people.
[02:06:50.384 --> 02:06:52.424]  You'd pay a price for it, but they were no good.
[02:06:52.484 --> 02:06:53.485]  I inherited these people.
[02:06:53.505 --> 02:06:54.085]  I didn't put him there.
[02:06:54.105 --> 02:06:54.945]  I didn't put Comey there.
[02:06:55.005 --> 02:06:55.605]  He was no good.
[02:06:56.066 --> 02:06:56.886]  I fired him.
[02:06:57.326 --> 02:06:58.646]  This guy hasn't fired anybody.
[02:06:59.027 --> 02:06:59.607]  He never fires.
[02:07:00.327 --> 02:07:10.310]  He should have fired every military man that was involved with that Afghan, the Afghanistan horror show, the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.
[02:07:11.230 --> 02:07:11.751]  He didn't fire.
[02:07:11.791 --> 02:07:12.751]  Did you fire anybody?
[02:07:13.111 --> 02:07:17.832]  Did you fire anybody that's on the border that's allowed us to have the worst border in the history of Europe?
[02:07:17.873 --> 02:07:25.295]  Did anybody get fired for allowing 18 million people, many from prisons, many from from mental institutions?
[02:07:25.355 --> 02:07:28.396]  Did you fire anybody that allowed our country to be destroyed?
[02:07:28.975 --> 02:07:31.234]  Joe, our country is being destroyed.
[02:07:31.234 --> 02:07:34.314]   As you and I sit up here and waste a lot of time on this debate.
[02:07:34.314 --> 02:07:35.595]  This shouldn't be a debate.
[02:07:35.595 --> 02:07:37.295]  He's the worst president.
[02:07:37.295 --> 02:07:39.675]   He just said it about me because I said it.
[02:07:39.675 --> 02:07:42.956]   But look, he's the worst president in the history of our country.
[02:07:42.956 --> 02:07:44.515]  He's destroyed our country.
[02:07:44.515 --> 02:07:47.055]   Now all of a sudden, he's trying to get tough on the border.
[02:07:47.055 --> 02:07:50.315]   You come out, came out with a nothing nothing deal
[02:07:50.315 --> 02:07:53.774]   and it reduced it a little bit, a little bit, like this much.
[02:07:53.774 --> 02:07:55.234]  It's insignificant.
[02:07:55.234 --> 02:07:56.855]  He wants open borders.
[02:07:57.114 --> 02:08:00.414]   He wants our country to either be destroyed or he wants to pick up
[02:08:00.414 --> 02:08:02.036]  those people as voters.
[02:08:02.036 --> 02:08:05.416]   And I don't think we just can't let it happen.
[02:08:05.416 --> 02:08:09.956]   If he wins this election, our country doesn't have a chance,
[02:08:09.956 --> 02:08:11.095]  not even a chance.
[02:08:11.852 --> 02:08:13.193]  Of coming out of this rut.
[02:08:13.613 --> 02:08:15.874]  We probably won't have a country left anymore.
[02:08:15.914 --> 02:08:16.755]  That's how bad it is.
[02:08:16.815 --> 02:08:17.295]  Totally true.
[02:08:17.315 --> 02:08:18.916]  It's the worst in history by far.
[02:08:19.556 --> 02:08:20.237]  Thank you, President Trump.
[02:08:20.257 --> 02:08:20.777]  President Biden?
[02:08:20.977 --> 02:08:23.138]  We are the most admired country in the world.
[02:08:23.619 --> 02:08:25.339]  We're the United States of America.
[02:08:25.780 --> 02:08:27.000]  There's nothing beyond our country.
[02:08:27.020 --> 02:08:32.704]  He left bad-mouthed America all day, says it's racist, says it's bad, and then he plays the good cop.
[02:08:33.934 --> 02:08:35.695]  No one wants to screw around with us.
[02:08:35.835 --> 02:08:37.196]  Number one.
[02:08:37.596 --> 02:08:41.098]  Number two, the idea that we're talking about worst presidents.
[02:08:41.438 --> 02:08:42.199]  I wasn't joking.
[02:08:42.539 --> 02:08:43.779]  Look it up or go online.
[02:08:43.799 --> 02:08:49.403]  159 or 58, don't hold me to the exact number, presidential historians.
[02:08:49.683 --> 02:08:51.084]  They've had meetings and they voted.
[02:08:51.384 --> 02:08:54.445]  Oh, political whores that tell us the North Pole melted?
[02:08:54.625 --> 02:08:55.286]  Best to worst.
[02:08:55.686 --> 02:08:58.788]  They said he was the worst father in all of American history.
[02:08:59.089 --> 02:08:59.749]  That's a fact.
[02:09:02.131 --> 02:09:03.372]  Trump was bad.
[02:09:03.432 --> 02:09:04.012]  It's a fact.
[02:09:04.232 --> 02:09:06.134]  Joe Biden had sex with his daughter in the shower.
[02:09:06.154 --> 02:09:06.694]  It's a fact.
[02:09:06.714 --> 02:09:08.115]  John Podesta's a pedophile.
[02:09:11.718 --> 02:09:14.279]  We should significantly increase the child care tax credit.
[02:09:14.639 --> 02:09:18.340]  We should significantly increase the availability of women and men.
[02:09:19.180 --> 02:09:20.521]  They hate the fact we're on air.
[02:09:20.701 --> 02:09:22.501]  They hate the fact we're exposing them.
[02:09:22.521 --> 02:09:23.502]  We're just starting to fight.
[02:09:23.882 --> 02:09:24.462]  We're winning.
[02:09:24.642 --> 02:09:25.182]  He's losing.
[02:09:25.202 --> 02:09:26.222]  He's a pedophile.
[02:09:26.242 --> 02:09:36.242]  He's a degenerate.
[02:09:36.528 --> 02:09:37.889]  Because what he's done is so bad.
[02:09:38.449 --> 02:09:40.830]  And they rate me, I'll show you, I will show you.
[02:09:40.910 --> 02:09:42.491]  And they rate me one of the best.
[02:09:43.111 --> 02:09:46.433]  And if I'm given another four years, I will be the best.
[02:09:46.513 --> 02:09:47.453]  I think I'll be the best.
[02:09:48.053 --> 02:09:48.714]  Nobody's ever...
[02:09:49.614 --> 02:09:51.015]  Created an economy like us.
[02:09:51.095 --> 02:09:52.716]  Nobody ever cut taxes like us.
[02:09:53.256 --> 02:09:54.097]  He's the only one I know.
[02:09:54.117 --> 02:09:56.279]  He wants to raise your taxes by four times.
[02:09:56.299 --> 02:09:57.359]  He has sex with his daughter in the shower.
[02:09:57.379 --> 02:09:59.841]  He wants to raise everybody's taxes by four times.
[02:09:59.861 --> 02:10:01.162]  He has sex with his daughter in the shower.
[02:10:01.242 --> 02:10:01.982]  It's a good firm.
[02:10:02.022 --> 02:10:03.363]  They admit it's real.
[02:10:03.403 --> 02:10:05.084]  He rapes his daughter in the shower.
[02:10:05.124 --> 02:10:06.025]  He's a pedophile.
[02:10:06.345 --> 02:10:07.406]  He rapes his daughter.
[02:10:10.868 --> 02:10:13.430]  He rapes America.
[02:10:13.810 --> 02:10:14.891]  We did more business.
[02:10:15.091 --> 02:10:19.214]  Apple and all these companies, they were bringing money back into our country.
[02:10:20.056 --> 02:10:23.129]  The worst president in history by far, and everybody knows it.
[02:10:23.857 --> 02:10:24.818]  And now for the pedophile.
[02:10:24.838 --> 02:10:27.219]  The truth of the matter is I rate my daughter every day in the shower.
[02:10:27.259 --> 02:10:27.979]  And I rate my daughter.
[02:10:27.999 --> 02:10:28.500]  I rate my daughter.
[02:10:29.119 --> 02:10:33.878]   He's increased, he will increase the taxes on middle class people.
[02:10:33.878 --> 02:10:38.038]   I said I'd never raise a tax on anybody unless they make less than $20,000.
[02:10:38.038 --> 02:10:39.038]  I didn't.
[02:10:39.038 --> 02:10:40.038]  But this tariff is 10% tax.
[02:10:40.038 --> 02:10:41.038]  And I rape my daughter.
[02:10:41.038 --> 02:10:43.559]   Everything coming into the country, you know what the economists say?
[02:10:43.559 --> 02:10:44.559]  I rape my daughter.
[02:10:44.559 --> 02:10:48.720]   That's going to cost the average American $2,500 a year more.
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:49.720]  I rape my daughter.
[02:10:49.720 --> 02:10:50.720]  Because you're going to have to pay the difference.
[02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:51.720]  I ship kids in for sex slavery.
[02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:52.720]  I'm a pedophile.
[02:10:53.414 --> 02:10:53.814]  I'm Joe Biden.
[02:10:53.834 --> 02:10:55.095]  And my son's a crackhead.
[02:10:55.135 --> 02:10:56.675]  Let's hear the racial jungle comment about blacks.
[02:10:56.494 --> 02:11:02.913]   He talks about how he is not raised He's he somehow helped the middle class
[02:11:02.913 --> 02:11:08.545]   Little class have been devastated by you now You want a new tax cut of five trillion dollars over the
[02:11:08.545 --> 02:11:12.305]   next ten years Which is going to fundamentally bankrupt the country you
[02:11:12.305 --> 02:11:16.833]   have the largest any president American history number one number two
[02:11:16.833 --> 02:11:22.474]   You have not in fact let's hear the racial jungle comment about black service any any progress
[02:11:23.154 --> 02:11:30.113]   Unless we do something about that cadre of young people tens of thousands of
[02:11:30.113 --> 02:11:37.875]   Born out of wedlock without parents without supervision without any structure without any
[02:11:37.875 --> 02:11:42.494]   Conscience developing it did contribute to mass incarceration in our country
[02:11:42.971 --> 02:11:48.857]  There's about 100,000 of them, if you want to be rhetorically extreme about it, who are the predators.
[02:11:49.017 --> 02:11:51.279]  They are beyond the pale, many of those people.
[02:11:51.359 --> 02:11:55.042]  We have no choice but to take them out of society.
[02:11:55.723 --> 02:12:01.608]  It's awful hard, as well, to get Latinx vaccinated, as well.
[02:12:01.708 --> 02:12:01.989]  Why?
[02:12:02.879 --> 02:12:05.322]  They're worried that they'll be vaccinated and deported.
[02:12:05.623 --> 02:12:06.204]  Because I was 29.
[02:12:06.364 --> 02:12:08.847]  I'm like the token black or the token woman.
[02:12:08.887 --> 02:12:09.969]  I was the token young person.
[02:12:10.329 --> 02:12:14.374]  Even call centers was rushed overseas in the hundreds of thousands.
[02:12:15.251 --> 02:12:16.491]  How many times do you get the call?
[02:12:16.772 --> 02:12:19.313]  I'd like to talk to you about your credit card.
[02:12:19.493 --> 02:12:26.855]  If you were, you know, the emperor right now, you're running the show, what are the things that you would do?
[02:12:27.075 --> 02:12:31.357]  Lee Kuan Yew, who most foreign policy experts around the world say is the... Let's go back to Trump.
[02:12:31.377 --> 02:12:32.017]  Go back to Trump.
[02:12:32.417 --> 02:12:33.318]  But he hasn't done that.
[02:12:33.838 --> 02:12:37.359]  But he hasn't cut the tariffs because he can't, because it's too much money.
[02:12:37.699 --> 02:12:44.901]   But he's got the largest deficit in the history of our country, and he's got the worst The worst situation with China.
[02:12:45.222 --> 02:12:49.963]  China's going to own us if you keep allowing them to do what they're doing to us as a country.
[02:12:50.243 --> 02:12:53.843]  They are killing us as a country, Joe, and you can't let that happen.
[02:12:53.964 --> 02:12:55.204]  You're destroying our country.
[02:12:56.244 --> 02:12:58.645]  So, President Trump, you have 67 seconds left.
[02:12:58.665 --> 02:13:04.666]  The question was, what are you going to do to help Americans in the throes of addiction right now who are struggling to get the treatment they need?
[02:13:05.002 --> 02:13:08.361]   take we're doing very well in addiction until the COVID came along.
[02:13:08.361 --> 02:13:14.361]   We had the two and a half, almost three years of like nobody's ever had before any country in every way.
[02:13:14.361 --> 02:13:21.721]   And then we had to get tough. And it was the drugs pouring across the border where it started to increase.
[02:13:21.882 --> 02:13:23.063]  We got great equipment.
[02:13:23.123 --> 02:13:27.964]  We bought the certain dog that's the most incredible thing that you've ever seen, the way they can spot it.
[02:13:28.324 --> 02:13:33.025]  We did a lot, and we were getting very low numbers, very, very low numbers.
[02:13:33.365 --> 02:13:34.245]  Then he came along.
[02:13:34.605 --> 02:13:36.686]  The numbers, have you seen the numbers now?
[02:13:37.146 --> 02:13:43.108]  It's not only the 18 million people that I believe is even low, because the gotaways, they don't even talk about gotaways.
[02:13:43.988 --> 02:13:48.629]  But the numbers of the amount of drugs and human trafficking in women.
[02:13:49.311 --> 02:13:55.070]   coming across our border. The worst thing I've ever seen, at numbers that nobody's ever seen
[02:13:55.070 --> 02:14:02.591]   under him, but the number of drugs coming across our border now is the largest we've ever had by
[02:14:02.591 --> 02:14:05.870]  far. President Trump, thank you. President Biden.
[02:14:06.013 --> 02:14:06.734]  Roll over everything.
[02:14:06.754 --> 02:14:07.494]  More fentanyl machines.
[02:14:07.333 --> 02:14:11.773]   down for a while. That's a lie. And I wanted to make sure we use the machinery
[02:14:11.773 --> 02:14:15.132]   that can detect fentanyl. These big machines that roll over everything that
[02:14:15.132 --> 02:14:21.134]   comes across the border and it costs a lot of money. Roll over everything. That's a bipartisan deal.
[02:14:21.134 --> 02:14:28.134]   More fentanyl machines. More fentanyl machines. More numbers of agents.
[02:14:28.104 --> 02:14:31.104]  more numbers of all the people at the border.
[02:14:31.104 --> 02:14:38.104]   And when we had that deal done, he called his Republican colleagues and said, "Don't do it. It's going to hurt me."
[02:14:38.104 --> 02:14:39.104]  No, it was an amnesty plan.
[02:14:39.104 --> 02:14:40.104]  He never argued it's not a good bill.
[02:14:40.104 --> 02:14:41.104]  You liar.
[02:14:41.104 --> 02:14:44.104]  It's a really good bill. We need those machines.
[02:14:44.446 --> 02:14:45.527]  We need those machines.
[02:14:45.928 --> 02:14:50.851]  And we're coming down very hard in every country in Asia in terms of precursors for fentanyl.
[02:14:51.232 --> 02:14:55.495]  And Mexico is working with us to make sure they don't have the technology to be able to put it together.
[02:14:56.035 --> 02:14:57.056]  That's what we have to do.
[02:14:57.156 --> 02:14:58.577]  We need those machines.
[02:14:59.078 --> 02:15:00.098]  Thank you, President Biden.
[02:15:00.138 --> 02:15:06.283]  President Trump, and again, the question is about Americans in the throes of addiction right now struggling to get the treatment they need.
[02:15:06.683 --> 02:15:08.645]  Well, this, because this does pertain to it.
[02:15:09.345 --> 02:15:10.806]  He ended Remain in Mexico.
[02:15:11.775 --> 02:15:13.056]  He ended catch-and-release.
[02:15:13.156 --> 02:15:15.958]  I made a catch-and-release in Mexico, not catch-and-release here.
[02:15:15.978 --> 02:15:17.039]  He totally opened the border!
[02:15:17.059 --> 02:15:18.700]  We had so many things that we had done.
[02:15:18.880 --> 02:15:20.622]  He said, if I win, I'm immediately surged.
[02:15:20.702 --> 02:15:21.802]  I got it all for nothing.
[02:15:22.383 --> 02:15:23.764]  It's just like when you have a hostage.
[02:15:23.804 --> 02:15:25.886]  We always pay $6 billion for a hostage.
[02:15:25.946 --> 02:15:27.227]  Every time we say there's a hostage.
[02:15:27.767 --> 02:15:30.109]  Now we have a hostage, a Wall Street Journal reporter.
[02:15:31.041 --> 02:15:36.760]   I think a good guy and he's over there because Putin is laughing at this guy probably asking
[02:15:36.760 --> 02:15:40.041]  for billions of dollars for the reporter.
[02:15:40.041 --> 02:15:44.681]  I will have him out very quickly as soon as I take office.
[02:15:44.681 --> 02:15:49.961]   Before I take office, I said by literally as soon as I win the election, I will have
[02:15:49.961 --> 02:15:51.239]  that reporter out.
[02:15:51.239 --> 02:15:53.320]  He should have had him out a long time ago.
[02:15:53.320 --> 02:15:57.121]   But Putin's probably asking for billions and billions of dollars because this guy pays
[02:15:57.121 --> 02:15:58.201]  it every time.
[02:15:58.201 --> 02:15:59.201]  We had two cases.
[02:15:59.201 --> 02:16:01.801]  I paid six billion dollars for five people.
[02:16:01.801 --> 02:16:05.240]  I got 58 people out and I paid essentially nothing.
[02:16:06.083 --> 02:16:06.863]  Thank you, President Trump.
[02:16:06.883 --> 02:16:07.083]  Dana?
[02:16:07.503 --> 02:16:10.444]  Let's turn to concerns that voters have about each of you.
[02:16:11.204 --> 02:16:15.506]  President Biden, you would be 86 at the end of your second term.
[02:16:15.526 --> 02:16:18.607]  Drugs now reporting, they're gonna replace Biden as we told you three years ago.
[02:16:18.627 --> 02:16:22.868]  About your capability to handle the toughest job in the world well into your 80s.
[02:16:22.888 --> 02:16:31.467]   Well, first of all, I I'm being criticized for being the youngest person in politics.
[02:16:31.527 --> 02:16:36.109]  I was the second youngest person ever elected to the United States Senate, and now I'm the oldest.
[02:16:36.489 --> 02:16:38.830]  This guy's three years younger and a lot less competent.
[02:16:39.551 --> 02:16:40.911]  I think that just look at the record.
[02:16:41.031 --> 02:16:41.751]  Look at what I've done.
[02:16:41.812 --> 02:16:44.393]  Look how I've turned around the horrible situation he left me.
[02:16:44.993 --> 02:16:50.235]  As I said, 15 million new jobs, 800,000 manufacturing jobs, more investment in America.
[02:16:50.915 --> 02:16:56.819]  Over millions, billions of dollars in private investment in enterprises that we are growing.
[02:16:57.739 --> 02:17:02.722]  By the way, we brought off a lot of people, the whole idea of computer chips.
[02:17:02.762 --> 02:17:04.183]  We used to have 40% of the market.
[02:17:04.564 --> 02:17:12.889]  We invented those chips and we lost it because he was sending people to find the cheapest jobs overseas and to bring home a product.
[02:17:13.369 --> 02:17:15.390]  So I went to South Korea.
[02:17:15.830 --> 02:17:19.713]  I convinced Samsung to invest billions of dollars here in the United States.
[02:17:20.333 --> 02:17:21.574]  And guess what?
[02:17:22.014 --> 02:17:27.479]  Those fabs they call to build these ships, those fabs pay over $100,000.
[02:17:27.559 --> 02:17:30.301]  You don't need a college degree for them.
[02:17:30.721 --> 02:17:40.869]  And there's billions, about $40 billion already being invested and being built right now in the United States, creating significant jobs for Americans from all over the world.
[02:17:41.561 --> 02:17:43.544]  President Biden, you have 40 seconds left.
[02:17:43.644 --> 02:17:44.545]  Would you like to add anything?
[02:17:44.765 --> 02:17:45.346]  Yeah, I would.
[02:17:45.907 --> 02:17:50.132]  The idea that somehow we are this failing country.
[02:17:50.153 --> 02:17:52.616]  I've never heard a president talk like this before.
[02:17:54.084 --> 02:17:55.145]  We're the envy of the world.
[02:17:55.325 --> 02:18:03.268]  Name me a single major country president who wouldn't trade places with the United States of America for all our problems and all our opportunities.
[02:18:03.869 --> 02:18:06.410]  We're the most progressive country in the world in getting things done.
[02:18:06.910 --> 02:18:08.371]  We're the strongest country in the world.
[02:18:08.751 --> 02:18:12.232]  We're a country in the world who keeps our word and everybody trusts us.
[02:18:12.633 --> 02:18:17.735]  All of our allies and those who he coddles up to.
[02:18:18.135 --> 02:18:20.836]  All the left does is tell you America's bad.
[02:18:21.196 --> 02:18:21.977]  All day long.
[02:18:23.077 --> 02:18:24.058]  Then he plays good cop.
[02:18:24.078 --> 02:18:27.781]  They've given Biden 20 minutes longer.
[02:18:27.841 --> 02:18:34.105]  They're literally giving Biden all the time.
[02:18:34.225 --> 02:18:36.206]  I took two tests, cognitive tests.
[02:18:36.286 --> 02:18:36.767]  I aced them.
[02:18:37.227 --> 02:18:38.248]  Both of them, as you know.
[02:18:38.728 --> 02:18:39.569]  We made it public.
[02:18:39.709 --> 02:18:40.289]  He took none.
[02:18:40.309 --> 02:18:41.410]  I'd like to see him take one.
[02:18:41.450 --> 02:18:41.910]  Just one.
[02:18:42.190 --> 02:18:42.891]  A real easy one.
[02:18:43.291 --> 02:18:44.792]  Like, go through the first five questions.
[02:18:44.812 --> 02:18:45.393]  He couldn't do it.
[02:18:46.073 --> 02:18:47.494]  But I took two cognitive tests.
[02:18:47.574 --> 02:18:49.596]  I took physical exams every year.
[02:18:50.476 --> 02:18:55.099]  And you know, we knock on wood, wherever we may have wood, that I'm in very good health.
[02:18:55.199 --> 02:18:58.060]  I just won two club championships, not even senior.
[02:18:58.360 --> 02:18:59.701]  Two regular club championships.
[02:18:59.741 --> 02:19:04.523]  To do that, you have to be quite smart and you have to be able to hit the ball a long way.
[02:19:04.944 --> 02:19:05.444]  And I do it.
[02:19:05.624 --> 02:19:06.224]  He doesn't do it.
[02:19:06.244 --> 02:19:07.445]  He can't hit a ball 50 yards.
[02:19:07.485 --> 02:19:08.766]  He challenged me to a golf match.
[02:19:09.206 --> 02:19:10.447]  He can't hit a ball 50 yards.
[02:19:11.467 --> 02:19:12.668]  I think I'm in very good shape.
[02:19:12.768 --> 02:19:16.690]  I feel that I'm in as good a shape as I was 25, 30 years ago.
[02:19:16.770 --> 02:19:18.351]  Actually, I'm probably a little bit lighter.
[02:19:19.031 --> 02:19:22.754]  But I'm in as good a shape as I was years ago.
[02:19:22.815 --> 02:19:24.556]  I feel very good.
[02:19:24.576 --> 02:19:26.898]  I was willing to take a cognitive test.
[02:19:26.958 --> 02:19:27.419]  And you know what?
[02:19:27.459 --> 02:19:28.800]  If I didn't do well, I aced him.
[02:19:29.701 --> 02:19:35.506]  Dr. Ronny Jackson, who's a great guy when he was White House doctor.
[02:19:35.887 --> 02:19:38.649]  And both, one of them said they've never seen anybody ace him.
[02:19:39.029 --> 02:19:40.551]  Thank you, President Biden.
[02:19:41.377 --> 02:19:44.939]  You can see he is 6'5 and only 223 pounds.
[02:19:45.299 --> 02:19:46.560]  Or 235 pounds.
[02:19:47.921 --> 02:19:49.082]  Well, you said 6'4, 200.
[02:19:49.242 --> 02:19:51.683]  That is Jerry Trump's mic off.
[02:19:52.103 --> 02:19:55.846]  Anyway, just take a look at what he says he is and take a look at what he is.
[02:19:56.366 --> 02:19:59.388]  Look, I'd be happy to have a driving contest with him.
[02:19:59.408 --> 02:20:02.289]  I got my handicap, which when I was vice president.
[02:20:02.469 --> 02:20:03.610]  Good, let's see it.
[02:20:03.930 --> 02:20:05.411]  Play golf with Trump next week.
[02:20:05.671 --> 02:20:06.652]  You will, you will.
[02:20:07.112 --> 02:20:09.794]  God, oh my God, this is so sick.
[02:20:10.879 --> 02:20:11.619]  I think you can do it.
[02:20:12.520 --> 02:20:13.581]  That's the biggest lie that he's ever told.
[02:20:13.601 --> 02:20:15.222]  He's a six handicapped of all.
[02:20:15.782 --> 02:20:17.223]  I was an eight handicapped.
[02:20:17.824 --> 02:20:19.645]  Eight?
[02:20:19.685 --> 02:20:21.726]  I've seen you swing.
[02:20:21.766 --> 02:20:22.407]  I know you swing.
[02:20:22.987 --> 02:20:24.248]  Let's not act like children.
[02:20:27.739 --> 02:20:28.540]  You are a child.
[02:20:28.399 --> 02:20:34.719]   concern that voters have about you. Will you pledge tonight that once all legal
[02:20:34.719 --> 02:20:39.679]   challenges have been exhausted that you will accept the results of this election?
[02:20:39.679 --> 02:20:44.500]   Will you let us steal the election again? And you will say right now that political
[02:20:44.500 --> 02:20:48.680]  violence in any form is unacceptable.
[02:20:46.781 --> 02:20:48.282]  Oh, the left pushed Sport Alliance, hold on!
[02:20:48.302 --> 02:20:50.343]  I have to say that, but of course I believe that.
[02:20:50.704 --> 02:20:52.064]  It's totally unacceptable.
[02:20:52.785 --> 02:21:00.709]  And if you would see my statements that I made on Twitter at the time, and also my statement that I made in the Rose Garden, you would say it's one of the strongest statements you've ever seen.
[02:21:00.789 --> 02:21:07.794]  In addition to the speech I made, in front of, I believe, the largest crowd I've ever spoken to, and I will tell you, nobody ever talks about that.
[02:21:07.834 --> 02:21:11.576]  They talk about a relatively small number of people that went to the Capitol.
[02:21:11.895 --> 02:21:14.495]  and in many cases were ushered in by the police.
[02:21:14.495 --> 02:21:18.295]   And as Nancy Pelosi said, it was her responsibility, not mine.
[02:21:18.295 --> 02:21:20.094]  She said that loud and clear.
[02:21:20.094 --> 02:21:25.395]   But the answer is, if the election is fair, free, and I want that more than anybody.
[02:21:25.395 --> 02:21:27.494]  And I'll tell you something.
[02:21:27.494 --> 02:21:30.695]   I wish he was a great president because I wouldn't be here right now.
[02:21:30.860 --> 02:21:34.421]  I'd be at one of my many places enjoying myself.
[02:21:34.701 --> 02:21:42.443]  I wouldn't be under indictment because I wouldn't have been his political opponent, you know, opponent because he indicted me because I was his opponent.
[02:21:42.623 --> 02:21:42.963]  Beautiful.
[02:21:43.003 --> 02:21:44.503]  I wish he was a great president.
[02:21:44.563 --> 02:21:44.963]  So strong.
[02:21:44.983 --> 02:21:46.044]  I would rather have that.
[02:21:46.244 --> 02:21:46.484]  Yes.
[02:21:46.704 --> 02:21:47.464]  I wouldn't be here.
[02:21:47.844 --> 02:21:48.724]  I don't mind being here.
[02:21:49.004 --> 02:21:51.505]  The only reason I'm here is he's so bad as a president.
[02:21:52.185 --> 02:21:53.826]  That I'm going to make America great again.
[02:21:53.846 --> 02:21:55.828]  We're going to make America great again.
[02:21:56.328 --> 02:21:57.810]  We're a failing nation right now.
[02:21:57.850 --> 02:21:59.531]  We're a seriously failing nation.
[02:22:00.051 --> 02:22:01.993]  And we're a failing nation because of him.
[02:22:02.393 --> 02:22:04.095]  His policies are so bad.
[02:22:05.075 --> 02:22:08.538]  His military policies are insane.
[02:22:08.799 --> 02:22:12.181]  Trump was winning before he just destroyed it right now.
[02:22:12.301 --> 02:22:13.783]  He will drive us into World War III.
[02:22:13.803 --> 02:22:14.443]  This is a rout.
[02:22:14.523 --> 02:22:17.886]  And closer to World War III than anybody can imagine.
[02:22:18.126 --> 02:22:21.848]  We are very, very close to World War III, and he's driving us there.
[02:22:22.208 --> 02:22:28.512]  And Kim Jong-un and President Xi of China, Kim Jong-un of North Korea, all of these are Putin.
[02:22:28.832 --> 02:22:29.873]  They don't respect him.
[02:22:30.193 --> 02:22:31.194]  They don't fear him.
[02:22:31.554 --> 02:22:36.117]  They have nothing going with this gentleman, and he's going to drive us into World War III.
[02:22:37.137 --> 02:22:37.458]  Boom!
[02:22:37.878 --> 02:22:43.684]  You want a World War III, let him follow and win and let Putin say, do what you want, NATO.
[02:22:44.165 --> 02:22:44.986]  Just do what you want.
[02:22:45.626 --> 02:22:46.648]  There's a thing called Article 5.
[02:22:46.908 --> 02:22:49.390]  An attack on one is an attack on all.
[02:22:49.410 --> 02:22:50.892]  A required response.
[02:22:50.992 --> 02:22:52.254]  What's your starting idea?
[02:22:52.634 --> 02:22:53.295]  The idea.
[02:22:53.735 --> 02:22:59.001]  I can't think of a single major leader in the world who wouldn't trade places with the job I've done.
[02:22:59.381 --> 02:23:00.782]  Oh, you're a piece of filth.
[02:23:00.862 --> 02:23:01.342]  You're a pedophile.
[02:23:01.362 --> 02:23:02.222]  Alright, Biden just got destroyed.
[02:23:02.242 --> 02:23:02.742]  Oh, yeah, right.
[02:23:02.762 --> 02:23:03.843]  The West will attack Putin for 10 years.
[02:23:03.863 --> 02:23:04.743]  It's all on video.
[02:23:04.563 --> 02:23:07.503]   means because of the American people they're capable of anything and they
[02:23:07.503 --> 02:23:13.502]   step up when they're needed and right now... Biden just got destroyed...
[02:23:13.502 --> 02:23:18.742]   and again you want to have a war just let Putin go ahead and take...
[02:23:18.742 --> 02:23:23.222]  Oh yeah right. The West will attack Putin for 10 years.
[02:23:23.222 --> 02:23:29.143]   It's all on video. Soros bragging. President Trump as I come back to you for a follow-up
[02:23:29.143 --> 02:23:34.983]   the question was will you accept the results of this election regardless of
[02:23:34.983 --> 02:23:37.343]  who wins?
[02:23:36.330 --> 02:23:37.612]  Just to finish what he said.
[02:23:37.632 --> 02:23:39.493]  The Democrats challenge every election.
[02:23:39.614 --> 02:23:39.974]  Russia.
[02:23:40.214 --> 02:23:40.935]  See, they're going to steal it.
[02:23:40.955 --> 02:23:42.216]  They took a lot of land from Bush.
[02:23:42.957 --> 02:23:45.720]  They took a lot of land from Obama and Biden.
[02:23:46.761 --> 02:23:49.343]  They took no land, nothing, from Trump.
[02:23:49.463 --> 02:23:49.804]  Nothing.
[02:23:49.844 --> 02:23:50.845]  He knew not to do it.
[02:23:51.681 --> 02:23:52.861]  He's not going to play games with me.
[02:23:52.901 --> 02:23:53.381]  He knew that.
[02:23:53.501 --> 02:23:55.902]  I got along with him very well, but he knew not to play games.
[02:23:56.342 --> 02:23:57.562]  He took nothing from me.
[02:23:58.942 --> 02:24:02.343]  But now he's going to take the whole thing from this man right here.
[02:24:03.203 --> 02:24:04.983]  That's a war that should have never started.
[02:24:05.023 --> 02:24:07.784]  It would have never started ever with me.
[02:24:08.704 --> 02:24:10.164]  And he's going to take Ukraine.
[02:24:11.145 --> 02:24:12.745]  And, you know, you asked me a question before.
[02:24:12.785 --> 02:24:13.445]  Would you do this?
[02:24:13.925 --> 02:24:18.006]  He's got us in such a bad position right now with with Ukraine and Russia.
[02:24:18.866 --> 02:24:20.467]  Because Ukraine's not winning that war.
[02:24:20.988 --> 02:24:23.089]  He said, I will never settle until such time.
[02:24:23.510 --> 02:24:26.652]  They're running out of people, they're running out of soldiers, they've lost so many people.
[02:24:26.772 --> 02:24:27.573]  It's so sad.
[02:24:28.273 --> 02:24:36.860]  They've lost so many people, and they've lost those gorgeous cities with the golden domes that are a thousand years old, all because of him and stupid decisions.
[02:24:37.360 --> 02:24:39.682]  Russia would have never attacked if I were president.
[02:24:39.702 --> 02:24:44.626]  President Trump, the question was, will you accept the results of the election, regardless of who wins?
[02:24:44.666 --> 02:24:45.387]  Yes or no, please.
[02:24:46.334 --> 02:24:50.296]  If it's a fair and legal and good election, absolutely.
[02:24:50.697 --> 02:24:53.899]  I would have much rather... The answer is Democrats challenge every election.
[02:24:53.919 --> 02:24:57.501]  The fraud and everything else was ridiculous.
[02:24:57.581 --> 02:24:59.942]  And if you want, we'll have a news conference on it in a week.
[02:25:00.062 --> 02:25:02.524]  Oh, they tried to censor all this before.
[02:25:02.844 --> 02:25:03.965]  They cannot stand this.
[02:25:04.005 --> 02:25:05.165]  Trump is dominating.
[02:25:05.185 --> 02:25:06.926]  There's nothing I'd rather do.
[02:25:06.947 --> 02:25:08.968]  It would be easier for me to do that.
[02:25:09.892 --> 02:25:11.573]  Then I'm running again.
[02:25:11.913 --> 02:25:15.635]  I wasn't really going to run until I saw the horrible job he did.
[02:25:15.655 --> 02:25:15.975]  He wasn't.
[02:25:15.995 --> 02:25:16.395]  He wasn't.
[02:25:16.455 --> 02:25:17.696]  He's destroying our country.
[02:25:18.036 --> 02:25:22.258]  I would be very happy to be someplace else in a nice... And they had to mess with Trump.
[02:25:22.678 --> 02:25:28.461]  And again, no indictments, no political opponent stuff, because it's the only way he thinks he can win.
[02:25:28.761 --> 02:25:34.524]  But unfortunately, it's driven up my numbers and driven them up to a very high level, because the people understand it.
[02:25:34.824 --> 02:25:35.044]  Yes.
[02:25:35.484 --> 02:25:38.085]  Well, let's see what your numbers are when this election is over.
[02:25:38.325 --> 02:25:38.865]  But you steal it.
[02:25:38.885 --> 02:25:39.405]  Let's see.
[02:25:39.885 --> 02:25:40.545]  You're a whiner.
[02:25:40.965 --> 02:25:46.267]  When you lost the first time, you continued, you appealed and appealed to courts all across the country.
[02:25:46.667 --> 02:25:50.908]  Not one single court in America- Never looked at any evidence.
[02:25:51.368 --> 02:25:52.748]  Never looked at any evidence.
[02:25:52.768 --> 02:25:53.448]  State or local.
[02:25:53.848 --> 02:25:54.129]  None.
[02:25:54.689 --> 02:26:00.790]  But you continue to provoke this lie about- Trump's 20 points ahead in real numbers.
[02:26:01.130 --> 02:26:01.890]  All this stealing.
[02:26:02.210 --> 02:26:03.991]  There is no evidence of that at all.
[02:26:04.651 --> 02:26:07.132]  And I tell you what, I doubt whether you'll accept it.
[02:26:07.212 --> 02:26:09.293]  There's no evidence you had sex with your daughter in the shower?
[02:26:09.333 --> 02:26:12.695]  If you lose again, you accepting anything, you can't stand the loss.
[02:26:12.755 --> 02:26:14.776]  Something snapped in you when you lost the last time.
[02:26:16.316 --> 02:26:22.239]  We'll be right back with more from the CNN presidential debate live from Georgia.
[02:26:23.139 --> 02:26:25.941]  OK, so they said this was going an hour and a half, right?
[02:26:27.141 --> 02:26:31.163]  So they yeah, yeah, they've done an hour and 25 minutes.
[02:26:31.223 --> 02:26:32.864]  So they've they've done.
[02:26:34.644 --> 02:26:34.945]  85 minutes.
[02:26:34.965 --> 02:26:39.747]  This is supposedly about to end right now, but they're going to continue on.
[02:26:39.767 --> 02:26:42.089]  They've got a giant audience, something Siena never has.
[02:26:42.949 --> 02:26:49.353]  Let's go to Harrison Smith, Owen Schroer, and Chase Geiser with responses from both of them, all three of them.
[02:26:49.393 --> 02:26:50.274]  Let's go to Owen first.
[02:26:50.334 --> 02:26:50.494]  Owen.
[02:26:51.914 --> 02:26:55.980]  I'm anticipating CNN at least comes back for closing statements.
[02:26:56.640 --> 02:26:57.902]  I'm anticipating that.
[02:26:58.042 --> 02:26:59.905]  If they didn't, that would be a little strange.
[02:27:01.126 --> 02:27:01.807]  I mean, wow.
[02:27:02.468 --> 02:27:05.332]  I don't know what Biden did that would have helped him at all.
[02:27:06.753 --> 02:27:11.993]   election. I really don't know anything he's done to strengthen his campaign or
[02:27:11.993 --> 02:27:17.592]   gain any undecided voters. I think this has been an outright slaughter by Trump.
[02:27:17.592 --> 02:27:24.233]   In fact, the top of Drudge Report right now says Biden debate disaster, Democrats
[02:27:24.233 --> 02:27:27.792]  looking to replace Joe Biden.
[02:27:26.305 --> 02:27:33.950]  Gavin Newsom was asked in the little waiting press room that they have there because they don't let anyone into the studio because it will confuse Joe Biden.
[02:27:34.190 --> 02:27:37.272]  Newsom was asked if he's ready to step in and replace Joe Biden.
[02:27:37.672 --> 02:27:38.853]  This has been an unmitigated disaster.
[02:27:38.873 --> 02:27:40.454]  They're calling it debate catastrophe.
[02:27:41.787 --> 02:27:44.408]  This has been an unmitigated disaster for Joe Biden.
[02:27:44.708 --> 02:27:49.169]  And so now the story, the story for Joe Biden has been, will he make it?
[02:27:49.589 --> 02:27:52.730]  Not his successes, not his accomplishments.
[02:27:53.570 --> 02:27:54.450]  It's will he make it?
[02:27:54.730 --> 02:28:00.471]  When that's the number one story of your campaign for presidency, I think you're in a bad spot.
[02:28:00.851 --> 02:28:03.672]  And this only, this only adds fuel to that.
[02:28:03.972 --> 02:28:04.772]  I totally agree.
[02:28:04.832 --> 02:28:07.673]  Trump totally dominated this despite them trying to rig it.
[02:28:09.074 --> 02:28:09.834]  This is insane.
[02:28:09.854 --> 02:28:11.515]  It's why Infowars is more important than ever.
[02:28:11.535 --> 02:28:13.397]  Why they're trying to shut us down right now.
[02:28:13.957 --> 02:28:14.918]  Let's go to Harrison Smith.
[02:28:15.598 --> 02:28:17.740]  Yeah, I mean clearly he's totally dominating.
[02:28:18.741 --> 02:28:21.723]  Biden totally fumbled his strongest points.
[02:28:21.983 --> 02:28:25.886]  Things like abortion, you know, whether you like it or not, that's like his strongest point right now.
[02:28:25.926 --> 02:28:30.229]  That's what all the polls say is, you know, a lot of single-issue voters rely on that.
[02:28:30.510 --> 02:28:32.691]  He totally fumbled, didn't make any good points there.
[02:28:33.692 --> 02:28:37.355]  The question about the black population, he completely fumbled, didn't make any good points there.
[02:28:37.875 --> 02:28:42.438]  After his strongest points, he totally failed on those.
[02:28:43.018 --> 02:28:47.641]  The quibbling about the golf was kind of hilarious, but Biden's basically gotten every last word.
[02:28:47.661 --> 02:28:49.121]  By the way, Biden doesn't even play golf.
[02:28:49.162 --> 02:28:52.804]  Trump routinely beats professional golfers at 78.
[02:28:53.344 --> 02:28:54.625]  It's just a fact.
[02:28:55.245 --> 02:28:56.586]  No, it's crazy.
[02:28:56.726 --> 02:28:58.947]  Biden's face hypnotizes me.
[02:28:59.287 --> 02:29:01.248]  There's something wrong with that huge face.
[02:29:01.709 --> 02:29:03.390]  It is truly wild.
[02:29:03.590 --> 02:29:05.231]  I've been monitoring Twitter.
[02:29:05.271 --> 02:29:06.732]  Yeah, look at Drudge with that face.
[02:29:07.452 --> 02:29:09.514]  Well, look, it's not just Drudge saying this.
[02:29:09.714 --> 02:29:15.899]  People are posting screenshots from places like Reddit, other places that are leftist-dominated, and frankly, they're on suicide watch right now.
[02:29:15.919 --> 02:29:18.261]  I mean, literally, they're going, I need to re-up my passport.
[02:29:18.301 --> 02:29:18.841]  I might have to leave.
[02:29:18.881 --> 02:29:22.324]  I mean, everybody recognizes that Biden totally fumbled this.
[02:29:22.424 --> 02:29:28.469]  It's been a complete failure, and even people on the left are lamenting his performance today.
[02:29:28.529 --> 02:29:29.990]  So, a total blowout by Trump.
[02:29:30.030 --> 02:29:30.751]  Incredible stuff.
[02:29:30.871 --> 02:29:31.131]  I agree.
[02:29:31.151 --> 02:29:31.692]  Chase Geiser.
[02:29:32.432 --> 02:29:33.132]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:29:33.172 --> 02:29:39.154]  One of the things, Alex, that I totally agree with you on is that it's very obvious that CNN is giving Biden more time.
[02:29:39.194 --> 02:29:43.976]  But one thing that I did notice is that very rarely are they actually cutting off Trump.
[02:29:44.276 --> 02:29:53.279]  Trump is intentionally yielding time at the end of his responses because I think his strategy was to have Biden speak as much as possible.
[02:29:53.700 --> 02:30:02.625]   And when Biden recites his memorized response, He's asked a follow-up question in struggles or grasps at straws in order to fill the rest of his time.
[02:30:02.665 --> 02:30:04.946]  So while Biden can't fill his time... Chase, great points.
[02:30:04.966 --> 02:30:05.707]  They're back live.
[02:30:05.727 --> 02:30:06.628]  We'll come back to you in a moment.
[02:30:06.648 --> 02:30:07.408]  Here we go.
[02:30:07.428 --> 02:30:09.690]  We're going to begin with you, President Biden.
[02:30:09.730 --> 02:30:10.491]  You have two minutes.
[02:30:14.099 --> 02:30:21.605]  We've made significant progress from the debacle that was left by President Trump in his last term.
[02:30:21.745 --> 02:30:22.926]  Oh my God, he's running out of steam.
[02:30:22.946 --> 02:30:26.328]  We find ourselves in a situation where, number one... It's happening!
[02:30:26.388 --> 02:30:27.369]  I've got an old engine running out.
[02:30:27.389 --> 02:30:28.890]  Clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack.
[02:30:29.190 --> 02:30:31.732]  I ask anyone out there in the audience... Black smoke's coming out.
[02:30:32.032 --> 02:30:34.714]  ...watching this debate, do you think the tax system is fair?
[02:30:35.669 --> 02:30:37.091]  Fact is... Move, bitch!
[02:30:37.271 --> 02:30:38.393]  Get out the way!
[02:30:38.433 --> 02:30:39.475]  Get out the way, bitch!
[02:30:39.515 --> 02:30:40.616]  Move out the way!
[02:30:41.137 --> 02:30:45.263]  ...increase in their taxes... Move out the way, you goddamn KKK heads!
[02:30:45.724 --> 02:30:50.130]  ...but this guy has increased your taxes because of the deficit... He did not.
[02:30:50.151 --> 02:30:50.791]  ...number one.
[02:30:51.232 --> 02:30:53.873]  He's increased inflation because of the debacle More lies!
[02:30:54.313 --> 02:30:56.234]  after the way he handled the pandemic.
[02:30:56.794 --> 02:31:04.036]  And he finds himself in a position where he now wants to tax you more by putting a 10% tariff on everything that comes into the United States of America.
[02:31:04.656 --> 02:31:10.598]  What I did, when for example, he wants to get away with Well, it makes people buy American to do that.
[02:31:11.938 --> 02:31:13.759]  China has internal tariffs against us.
[02:31:14.859 --> 02:31:18.020]  The idea that tariffs are a tax on us?
[02:31:19.260 --> 02:31:19.921]  Well, guess what?
[02:31:21.854 --> 02:31:25.937]  We got it down to $35 for insulin instead of $400.
[02:31:26.277 --> 02:31:27.859]  No more than $2,000.
[02:31:27.919 --> 02:31:30.561]  All he talks about is insulin.
[02:31:30.801 --> 02:31:33.683]  No matter how much prescription they need.
[02:31:33.763 --> 02:31:35.424]  Insulin, insulin, insulin, insulin.
[02:31:35.444 --> 02:31:37.246]  That reduced the federal deficit.
[02:31:37.706 --> 02:31:38.847]  The fentanyl death?
[02:31:38.867 --> 02:31:39.507]  Babbling moron!
[02:31:39.527 --> 02:31:39.928]  Let's go!
[02:31:39.747 --> 02:31:44.627]   billion dollars over 10 years because the government doesn't have to pay them. I'm going
[02:31:44.627 --> 02:31:50.907]   to make that available to every citizen. All along, and it's happening now. And everybody
[02:31:50.907 --> 02:31:55.426]   in America, he wants to get rid of that. I'm going to make sure that we have child care.
[02:31:55.426 --> 02:31:59.707]   We're going to significantly increase the credit people have for child care. I'm going
[02:31:59.707 --> 02:32:04.028]   to make sure we do something about what we're doing on lead pipes and all.
[02:32:03.784 --> 02:32:06.784]  all the things that are causing health problems.
[02:32:06.784 --> 02:32:08.703]  Let's go, Brandon.
[02:32:08.703 --> 02:32:11.024]  We're going to continue to fight to bring down inflation.
[02:32:11.024 --> 02:32:12.905]  Let's go, Brandon.
[02:32:13.792 --> 02:32:16.153]  President Trump, you now have two minutes for your closing statement.
[02:32:16.193 --> 02:32:17.093]  Thank you, President.
[02:32:17.213 --> 02:32:20.034]  Like so many politicians, this man is just a complainer.
[02:32:20.414 --> 02:32:21.654]  He said, we want to do this.
[02:32:21.714 --> 02:32:22.494]  We want to do that.
[02:32:22.554 --> 02:32:24.275]  We want to get rid of this tax, that tax.
[02:32:25.155 --> 02:32:26.155]  But he doesn't do anything.
[02:32:26.695 --> 02:32:32.277]  He doesn't do all he does is make our country unsafe by allowing millions and millions of people to pour in.
[02:32:32.817 --> 02:32:34.357]  Our military doesn't respect him.
[02:32:34.397 --> 02:32:36.258]  We look like fools in Afghanistan.
[02:32:36.938 --> 02:32:37.578]  We didn't stop.
[02:32:38.178 --> 02:32:40.840]  Israel, it was such a horrible thing that would have never happened.
[02:32:40.880 --> 02:32:41.860]  It should have never happened.
[02:32:41.940 --> 02:32:42.941]  Iran was broke.
[02:32:43.381 --> 02:32:48.144]  Anybody that did business with Iran, including China, they couldn't do business with the United States.
[02:32:48.164 --> 02:32:48.945]  They all passed.
[02:32:49.145 --> 02:32:49.945]  Iran was broke.
[02:32:50.146 --> 02:32:53.047]  They had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah, for terror.
[02:32:53.087 --> 02:32:54.048]  No money whatsoever.
[02:32:54.608 --> 02:32:56.750]  Again, Ukraine should have never happened.
[02:32:57.290 --> 02:32:58.990]  He talks about all this stuff, but he didn't do it.
[02:32:59.030 --> 02:33:00.971]  For three and a half years, we're living in hell.
[02:33:01.431 --> 02:33:05.672]  We have the Palestinians, and we have everybody else rioting all over the place.
[02:33:06.012 --> 02:33:07.332]  You talk about Charlottesville.
[02:33:07.752 --> 02:33:10.813]  This is a hundred times Charlottesville, a thousand times Charlottesville.
[02:33:10.833 --> 02:33:12.894]  The whole country is exploding because of you.
[02:33:13.334 --> 02:33:14.574]  Because they don't respect you.
[02:33:14.834 --> 02:33:16.514]  And they have to respect their president.
[02:33:16.775 --> 02:33:18.395]  And they don't respect you throughout the world.
[02:33:19.387 --> 02:33:22.667]  What we did was incredible. We rebuilt the military.
[02:33:22.667 --> 02:33:26.667]   We got the largest tax cut in history, the largest regulation cut in history.
[02:33:26.667 --> 02:33:30.587]   The reason he's got jobs is because I cut the regulations and gave jobs.
[02:33:30.587 --> 02:33:33.547]  But he's putting a lot of those regulations back on.
[02:33:33.547 --> 02:33:37.627]   All of the things that we've done, nobody's ever seen anything like it.
[02:33:37.767 --> 02:33:40.009]  Even from a medical standpoint, right to try.
[02:33:40.049 --> 02:33:47.016]  Well, we can try space age materials instead of going to Asia or going to Europe and trying to get when you're terminally ill.
[02:33:47.417 --> 02:33:49.178]  Now you can go and you can get something.
[02:33:49.219 --> 02:33:50.260]  You sign a document.
[02:33:50.300 --> 02:33:52.822]  They've been trying to get it for 42 years.
[02:33:53.323 --> 02:34:04.695]   But you know what we did for the military was incredible choice for our soldiers, where our soldiers Instead of waiting for three months to see a doctor, can go out and get themselves fixed up and readied up.
[02:34:04.715 --> 02:34:05.156]  That's right.
[02:34:05.176 --> 02:34:05.356]  Beautiful.
[02:34:05.376 --> 02:34:06.417]  And take care of themselves.
[02:34:06.738 --> 02:34:07.358]  And they're living.
[02:34:07.378 --> 02:34:10.322]  And that's why I had the highest approval rating in the history of the VA.
[02:34:10.342 --> 02:34:10.762]  That's right.
[02:34:10.782 --> 02:34:11.723]  The VA will give you service.
[02:34:12.024 --> 02:34:13.125]  We're a failing nation.
[02:34:13.145 --> 02:34:13.485]  Beautiful.
[02:34:13.706 --> 02:34:15.327]  But it's not going to be failing anymore.
[02:34:15.347 --> 02:34:16.469]  We're going to make it great again.
[02:34:17.500 --> 02:34:20.543]  Thank you, former President Trump, President Biden.
[02:34:21.324 --> 02:34:24.948]  Stay with us because we have full analysis of this debate.
[02:34:25.329 --> 02:34:28.352]  Anderson Cooper and Aaron Burnett starts now on CNN.
[02:34:29.858 --> 02:34:36.545]  All right, so Trump just totally dominated, despite them giving Biden at least 12, 14 minutes.
[02:34:36.565 --> 02:34:37.606]  I was trying to write the numbers down.
[02:34:37.987 --> 02:34:39.268]  Over 10 minutes of extra time.
[02:34:40.409 --> 02:34:43.933]  As soon as Steven Crowder gets to the chair, I'm going to talk to him on his show.
[02:34:43.953 --> 02:34:45.395]  I'm looking at that right now.
[02:34:45.475 --> 02:34:48.759]  But let's go back to Chase Geiser got caught off by Trump coming back.
[02:34:49.379 --> 02:34:50.701]  Wow, that was domination.
[02:34:51.141 --> 02:34:51.701]  Absolutely, yeah.
[02:34:51.961 --> 02:34:59.544]  My last point before we went to the closing arguments was simply that Trump was intentionally yielding his time in many cases because he wanted Biden to speak more.
[02:34:59.564 --> 02:35:00.804]  It seems like that was his strategy.
[02:35:01.164 --> 02:35:05.125]  Biden failed to fill his time and was constantly asked follow-up questions.
[02:35:05.445 --> 02:35:08.306]  At one point, Dana Bash even said, is there anything more you would like to add?
[02:35:08.326 --> 02:35:10.267]  You have like 89 seconds left or something like that.
[02:35:10.287 --> 02:35:11.987]  And then he went on and grasped at straws.
[02:35:12.367 --> 02:35:14.908]  This was a disaster for Joe Biden, Alex.
[02:35:15.208 --> 02:35:17.729]  And I'm not just saying that because I'm a Trump supporter or I'm a right winger or whatever.
[02:35:17.749 --> 02:35:18.369]  No, it was clearly.
[02:35:18.929 --> 02:35:20.370]  If Trump lost, I'd say it.
[02:35:21.030 --> 02:35:22.211]  This was a disaster.
[02:35:22.991 --> 02:35:23.552]  Disaster.
[02:35:25.473 --> 02:35:26.814]  Even Drudge says it's a disaster.
[02:35:26.834 --> 02:35:28.195]  He's a Democrat operative now.
[02:35:29.196 --> 02:35:29.836]  Harrison Owen?
[02:35:30.336 --> 02:35:34.920]  Yeah, well, I'm just, again, just checking out what some of the leftists on Twitter are saying.
[02:35:35.060 --> 02:35:39.843]  Andrew Yang posts, guys, the Democrats should nominate someone else before it's too late.
[02:35:40.023 --> 02:35:42.545]  And the hashtag Swap Joe out is now trending.
[02:35:42.845 --> 02:35:44.706]  He also said, look, I debated Joe seven times in 2020.
[02:35:44.966 --> 02:35:45.847]  He's a different guy in 2024.
[02:35:45.887 --> 02:35:48.549]  So they're in full panic mode.
[02:35:48.909 --> 02:35:51.070]  Full on panic across the board.
[02:35:51.210 --> 02:35:51.931]  Or it was the plan.
[02:35:51.951 --> 02:35:52.491]  It might have been the plan.
[02:35:52.511 --> 02:36:04.238]  It might have been the plan, but yeah, they are, uh, everybody's recognizing it now and more people on Twitter are posting, you know, screenshots of people saying, you know, ooh, prominent leftists sending out texts saying, hey Gavin, we need you now.
[02:36:04.918 --> 02:36:06.899]  So they're ready to replace Joe after this.
[02:36:07.900 --> 02:36:12.303]  And Gavin Newsom, Biden's horrible, but Gavin Newsom is super unpopular.
[02:36:12.923 --> 02:36:13.323]  He's a creep.
[02:36:15.540 --> 02:36:17.301]  Well, the Democrats are in a real pinch.
[02:36:17.721 --> 02:36:22.863]  They have to nominate somebody before the end of July to get on the Ohio ballot.
[02:36:22.943 --> 02:36:29.066]  And right now, the plan was to do a virtual nomination to make sure that their candidate would be on the Ohio ballot.
[02:36:29.106 --> 02:36:39.570]  So, they either have to get the Ohio State Legislature to change their rules to get on the ballot, or they're going to have to make a move before their own convention.
[02:36:40.090 --> 02:36:43.372]  So, I mean, this is just totally topsy-turvy if you're the Democrats.
[02:36:43.812 --> 02:36:46.457]  Look, I've got a whole sheet of notes here.
[02:36:46.537 --> 02:36:49.182]  I'm not going to spend too much time getting into all of it right now.
[02:36:49.442 --> 02:36:51.146]  I think we just lay out the basics here.
[02:36:51.166 --> 02:36:52.368]  No, go through some of your notes here.
[02:36:52.588 --> 02:36:54.512]  As soon as Crowder comes in, I'll go live with it.
[02:36:54.552 --> 02:36:54.912]  Back to you.
[02:36:56.291 --> 02:37:09.396]  Well millions of people, who knows what the final TV ratings will be, this was streamed everywhere, just on X alone there were at least 10 million people watching this debate on all the different platforms on just X alone.
[02:37:09.656 --> 02:37:15.117]  So I can't even imagine the numbers on YouTube and Rumble and everywhere else where this was being streamed.
[02:37:16.818 --> 02:37:20.160]  Right out of the gates, Biden comes out and his voice is shot.
[02:37:20.981 --> 02:37:26.444]  It didn't take long for him to deteriorate in trying to get statements out of his mouth.
[02:37:26.784 --> 02:37:27.604]  He couldn't even talk.
[02:37:28.145 --> 02:37:29.786]  Trump was stable the whole time.
[02:37:29.806 --> 02:37:34.128]  I mean, look, I can sit here and I think I would say Trump was very sly.
[02:37:34.748 --> 02:37:41.592]  Yeah, I would say through through the entire 90 minutes or whatever it ended up being, Trump made maybe four mistakes the whole time.
[02:37:42.153 --> 02:37:45.555]  The entire Biden, every time he spoke, he made a mistake.
[02:37:46.158 --> 02:37:53.284]  He didn't have anything to offer the American people the entire time up there except a weak, quivering leader.
[02:37:53.604 --> 02:37:57.628]  And I would say Trump came off as the president in this debate.
[02:37:57.768 --> 02:38:00.110]  Biden came off as the quote-unquote contender.
[02:38:00.530 --> 02:38:03.633]  Biden came off as the guy who had to prove something.
[02:38:03.953 --> 02:38:05.895]  Trump came off like he was already the president.
[02:38:05.935 --> 02:38:07.476]  That was the aura that Trump had.
[02:38:07.816 --> 02:38:10.199]  Biden came off like he was trying to be the contender.
[02:38:11.420 --> 02:38:16.825]  I do agree that, and I said this earlier, I think Trump strategically let Biden have more time.
[02:38:16.865 --> 02:38:24.232]  Now that may have been an agenda from Democrat operatives Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, but I think Trump gladly went along with it.
[02:38:24.712 --> 02:38:26.614]  He figured, hey, look, let Biden talk more.
[02:38:26.634 --> 02:38:27.815]  That's only going to hurt him and help me.
[02:38:27.835 --> 02:38:28.476]  So what happens now?
[02:38:29.056 --> 02:38:31.699]  I mean, they're going to try to bring in Big Mike or Gavin Newsom.
[02:38:32.950 --> 02:38:37.995]  Well, and that's why I'm saying they're in a pinch right now, because they have very little time to make a decision.
[02:38:38.035 --> 02:38:41.158]  They basically have a month to decide what they're going to do.
[02:38:41.238 --> 02:38:44.481]  And now the calls for Biden to be replaced are just going to be amplified.
[02:38:45.182 --> 02:38:54.831]  And to go into an election with 130 days left and the number one story about your candidate, about your presumptive nominee, is he needs to be replaced?
[02:38:55.572 --> 02:38:56.873]  I don't know how they move forward with that.
[02:38:57.173 --> 02:39:01.116]  But even if they replace Joe Biden, here's the thing, this is a lose-lose situation.
[02:39:01.496 --> 02:39:03.137]  This is a total catastrophe.
[02:39:03.518 --> 02:39:05.839]  Replacing Joe Biden, it doesn't matter who they replace him with.
[02:39:06.260 --> 02:39:07.601]  That's a negative story.
[02:39:07.741 --> 02:39:14.265]  And again, he was already totally desperate and had to do this, thinking they hopped him up, blood doping, everything.
[02:39:14.726 --> 02:39:15.426]  It didn't work.
[02:39:15.446 --> 02:39:17.688]  I mean, they are in full panic mode.
[02:39:18.468 --> 02:39:19.909]  Look, look, look, look, sources.
[02:39:19.949 --> 02:39:21.831]  Dems saying we have a problem.
[02:39:22.191 --> 02:39:23.892]  That's Axelrod right now.
[02:39:23.932 --> 02:39:24.993]  Go to CNN, go to CNN.
[02:39:25.845 --> 02:39:28.487]  There are going to be discussions about whether he should continue.
[02:39:28.927 --> 02:39:33.390]  And I think part of it is Donald Trump did not meet his mission either.
[02:39:33.410 --> 02:39:49.481]  He could not resist the temptation to be nasty, to prevaricate about a whole bunch of things, about his own record, about Biden's record, and to seem petty and small at times.
[02:39:49.541 --> 02:39:55.845]  So what you saw was a candidate who's deeply vulnerable and a president who may not be able to take advantage of it.
[02:39:56.545 --> 02:40:05.947]  Listen, if anybody in America thinks that that was even close to being an okay debate by Joe Biden, I'm living in a parallel universe.
[02:40:06.807 --> 02:40:12.408]  That was an unmitigated disaster for President Biden from the second he walked out to the closing statement.
[02:40:12.728 --> 02:40:15.248]  The biggest issue for Democrats is abortion.
[02:40:15.688 --> 02:40:16.809]  And he couldn't give an answer.
[02:40:17.349 --> 02:40:18.029]  He gave an answer.
[02:40:19.129 --> 02:40:20.909]  He couldn't even give a coherent answer.
[02:40:20.929 --> 02:40:22.910]  Let's go back to Chase Geiser.
[02:40:23.030 --> 02:40:24.470]  They're totally turning on him right now.
[02:40:24.730 --> 02:40:37.377]  Yes, so what's interesting to me about this is if the Democrats really universally supported Joe Biden, every talking head, every pundit would be very careful and cautious and wary about how they respond to this.
[02:40:37.417 --> 02:40:42.940]  But since there's unilateral criticism of Biden implies to me that this was a setup for Biden.
[02:40:42.960 --> 02:40:46.462]  This was the plan the whole time to make Biden look like a disaster.
[02:40:47.041 --> 02:40:51.441]   that Roger Stone thinks it's gonna be Big Mike and he's a brilliant man, he's right so many times.
[02:40:51.441 --> 02:40:56.912]   And I know that Owen earlier today made some very reasonable remarks as to why he doesn't think it's gonna be
[02:40:56.912 --> 02:40:57.640]  Hillary Clinton.
[02:40:57.640 --> 02:41:01.341]   But I really think Hillary Clinton is gonna replace Joe Biden here for a couple of reasons.
[02:41:01.341 --> 02:41:03.940]  By the way, they're even hyping that in the Washington Post.
[02:41:03.940 --> 02:41:05.941]  It's a comeback story.
[02:41:05.282 --> 02:41:07.743]  So it's a comeback story versus a public comeback story.
[02:41:08.064 --> 02:41:13.105]  Despite the fact that she's unpopular, she's done things like restart the Clinton Foundation in the name of rebuilding Ukraine.
[02:41:13.145 --> 02:41:14.946]  It's just weird that she's appearing out of nowhere.
[02:41:14.966 --> 02:41:16.587]  She's got a book that came out this week.
[02:41:16.967 --> 02:41:18.327]  I think it's going to be Hillary, guys.
[02:41:18.507 --> 02:41:19.328]  I could be nuts.
[02:41:19.428 --> 02:41:25.110]  No, no, I think they're definitely it's like in Where's the Lost Ark where he's put in the back of the scene with the idol.
[02:41:25.530 --> 02:41:27.551]  They're trying to move Biden out, put Hillary in.
[02:41:27.631 --> 02:41:28.671]  I agree with you, Chase.
[02:41:29.592 --> 02:41:30.152]  Harrison Smith.
[02:41:31.487 --> 02:41:33.609]  I'm seeing Gavin Newsom being floated right now.
[02:41:33.629 --> 02:41:40.473]  Again, I'm just, you know, watching Twitter, watching the leftist feeds, and it's everybody throwing up the bat signal for Gavin Newsom.
[02:41:40.713 --> 02:41:44.015]  Whoever it is, the takeaway is, it ain't gonna be Joe Biden.
[02:41:44.055 --> 02:41:45.796]  I think he really blew it on this one.
[02:41:45.876 --> 02:41:49.038]  I mean, the man looked gray just from that alone.
[02:41:49.058 --> 02:41:51.039]  He looks old the whole time.
[02:41:51.079 --> 02:41:53.081]  He's making these faces like he doesn't know where the hell he is.
[02:41:53.121 --> 02:41:58.444]  I mean, there wasn't any major gaffe to point to, but he hardly got through an answer without stumbling.
[02:41:59.224 --> 02:42:02.847]  I again say this is just an unmitigated success for Donald Trump.
[02:42:04.047 --> 02:42:09.490]  He smashed it across the board and he especially did a good job tying things together like immigration and black unemployment.
[02:42:09.791 --> 02:42:23.719]  Pointing out like hey, immigration is the root of a lot of these issues that we're talking about and Joe Biden can pander all he wants but you know when you look at 10 million, 18 million people crossing the border and taking jobs that would have probably gone mostly to black people.
[02:42:24.479 --> 02:42:25.780]  Trump just did a fantastic job.
[02:42:25.900 --> 02:42:33.183]  I really, you know, I think the Democrats are just, they lose their own credibility by backing up Joe Biden at this point.
[02:42:33.243 --> 02:42:35.624]  And so they're all looking to a savior.
[02:42:35.644 --> 02:42:39.806]  And it looks like Gavin Newsom is the top choice that I'm seeing on social media.
[02:42:40.967 --> 02:42:41.707]  That's what I was saying.
[02:42:41.727 --> 02:42:42.788]  They are floating Hillary.
[02:42:43.308 --> 02:42:43.508]  Yeah.
[02:42:44.108 --> 02:42:45.589]  And they definitely want big Mike Owen.
[02:42:46.707 --> 02:42:52.188]  I think the problem they have with bringing Hillary Clinton to the front is the narrative.
[02:42:52.469 --> 02:42:53.509]  How do you explain it?
[02:42:53.969 --> 02:42:56.650]  How do you explain leapfrogging Kamala Harris?
[02:42:57.130 --> 02:43:00.611]  And they might say, oh, well, it was stolen from Hillary.
[02:43:00.671 --> 02:43:01.811]  She legitimately won.
[02:43:01.911 --> 02:43:04.632]  Well, OK, so now you're an election denier?
[02:43:05.112 --> 02:43:08.873]  So I just see too many traps in the narrative for them to bring Hillary forward.
[02:43:08.913 --> 02:43:16.992]   Now, that doesn't mean they might not use Hillary as kind of a a leaping platform for whoever it is or say, "Oh, we'll
[02:43:16.992 --> 02:43:23.592]   bring in the great Hillary as a vice or maybe we bring her in as the State Department again."
[02:43:23.592 --> 02:43:28.773]   But I would say this, if they do put Clinton on there as the vice president, whoever the
[02:43:28.773 --> 02:43:34.452]   president is should have double secret service, double private protection, quadruple check
[02:43:34.452 --> 02:43:41.013]   their food for poisoning, because you're really flirting with danger if you bring that up.
[02:43:41.042 --> 02:43:43.025]  I agree, but we're witnessing the death...
[02:43:43.766 --> 02:43:45.207]  Of the political establishment.
[02:43:45.787 --> 02:43:49.068]  Like, with the general public, who's only half awake, they're already done.
[02:43:49.108 --> 02:43:51.649]  With us, those of us that are awake, they're already completely done.
[02:43:52.210 --> 02:43:54.110]  This is an incredible moment.
[02:43:54.451 --> 02:43:57.812]  Trump, like a sly cat, was better than any other debate.
[02:43:57.872 --> 02:44:02.274]  He just sat there and was relaxed and destroyed Joe Biden.
[02:44:02.314 --> 02:44:03.494]  This was incredible.
[02:44:03.514 --> 02:44:04.515]  You know, I wrote that down.
[02:44:04.835 --> 02:44:06.976]  It looked like Donald Trump was preparing for a week.
[02:44:07.336 --> 02:44:08.957]  Joe Biden looked dazed and confused.
[02:44:09.517 --> 02:44:17.486]  Trump looks like he was the one that was prepared for a week, and he just did his normal routine, campaigning, legal issues, fundraising, and just showed up to the debate and knocked it out of the park.
[02:44:18.968 --> 02:44:21.831]  Well, Trump didn't know what he was up against eight years ago.
[02:44:22.231 --> 02:44:25.155]  He does now, and it's a totally different ballgame now.
[02:44:26.218 --> 02:44:30.802]  And he pointed out, you know, how successful he's been post the conviction.
[02:44:31.182 --> 02:44:34.064]  Just, you know, just shattering all of their narratives one after the other.
[02:44:34.085 --> 02:44:38.528]  And it's funny you call him a sly cat, Alex, because that was the insult Joe Biden used.
[02:44:38.628 --> 02:44:41.511]  It was like one of the only insults flung during this thing.
[02:44:41.551 --> 02:44:44.333]  And he said you have the attitude of an alley cat.
[02:44:44.433 --> 02:44:45.714]  It's like, that's cool.
[02:44:46.495 --> 02:44:48.316]  I can't help but make Trump sound cool.
[02:44:48.817 --> 02:44:52.680]  Again, I just I mean, this this really fulfilled all my expectations coming into this.
[02:44:53.160 --> 02:44:54.401]  Yeah, there's the dredge headline.
[02:44:54.841 --> 02:44:57.283]  White House spends worst performance in history.
[02:44:57.823 --> 02:44:59.124]  Joe has a cold.
[02:44:59.664 --> 02:45:00.705]  Oh, my God.
[02:45:00.865 --> 02:45:02.166]  We thought they would have said that earlier.
[02:45:02.186 --> 02:45:03.967]  Yeah, I'm sure he does have a cold.
[02:45:04.527 --> 02:45:04.928]  I'm sure.
[02:45:04.948 --> 02:45:06.348]  The vaccine didn't work.
[02:45:06.549 --> 02:45:07.629]  It's the middle of summer, guys.
[02:45:07.789 --> 02:45:10.491]  So, you know, he left the shower on too long with his daughter.
[02:45:12.301 --> 02:45:13.562]  Ran out of hot water in the hot water game.
[02:45:13.582 --> 02:45:14.683]  His daughter's a little old for this.
[02:45:14.703 --> 02:45:18.946]  But notice how CNN thought, no one can carry this as if they could control it.
[02:45:19.066 --> 02:45:23.930]  I mean, they have no power anymore, folks, other than starting World War III.
[02:45:24.330 --> 02:45:25.632]  And that's why we gotta be serious.
[02:45:25.652 --> 02:45:26.732]  They're building FEMA camps.
[02:45:27.073 --> 02:45:28.274]  They're planning a race war.
[02:45:28.954 --> 02:45:33.758]  We can sit here and sit back and go, oh, we're winning, but the enemy's still got some tricks up their sleeves.
[02:45:34.138 --> 02:45:36.560]  Don't just think they've got a puppet Biden and we've already won this.
[02:45:37.381 --> 02:45:38.782]  Guys, talk about what you're worried about.
[02:45:43.453 --> 02:45:48.757]  I'm worried about political violence.
[02:45:48.977 --> 02:45:50.338]  I'm worried about a cyber attack.
[02:45:50.438 --> 02:45:52.040]  I'm worried about a false flag.
[02:45:52.060 --> 02:46:00.106]  I think these are the top three cards they have to try to distract from whatever's going on with Joe and then maybe use that to replace Joe.
[02:46:00.226 --> 02:46:01.707]  I think those are their top three cards.
[02:46:02.127 --> 02:46:05.029]   Some form of political violence, a false No, I agree.
[02:46:05.109 --> 02:46:09.170]  Couldn't they assassinate Biden to make them victims and then they bring it?
[02:46:09.270 --> 02:46:10.810]  Only way they win is assassinating Biden.
[02:46:11.210 --> 02:46:11.891]  And I don't want that.
[02:46:11.951 --> 02:46:12.671]  I'm totally against it.
[02:46:12.691 --> 02:46:14.631]  I'm saying that is in the calculus.
[02:46:16.151 --> 02:46:23.533]  Yeah, that would probably fall in the false flag category should that happen, which would be god-awful for America to have a presidential assassination.
[02:46:23.553 --> 02:46:27.254]  Well, you know, I'm good at predicting stuff, and I'm just saying if I was the enemy, that's what I'd do.
[02:46:28.494 --> 02:46:32.455]  Yeah, if I was Joe, I'd stay in hiding maybe for another 130 days.
[02:46:35.740 --> 02:46:43.204]  I think if I wanted to cause the most chaos, I would let Trump win and then pull something off, an assassination of some sort.
[02:46:43.224 --> 02:46:53.950]  You know, if you're going from the most chaos possible, I think that's the way you get both the Trump supporters and the, you know, Antifa squadrons both riled up and going after each other.
[02:46:54.630 --> 02:46:56.131]  And that's been my prediction for a little while.
[02:46:56.151 --> 02:46:57.012]  No, I agree.
[02:46:57.032 --> 02:47:00.454]  It's the 79 days of hell like we had four years ago.
[02:47:00.834 --> 02:47:02.675]  When Trump is president-elect, what will they pull?
[02:47:04.079 --> 02:47:08.362]  Well, like I said, I think assassination is not off the table.
[02:47:08.402 --> 02:47:11.163]  I don't think they do it before the presidential race.
[02:47:11.203 --> 02:47:18.288]  But, you know, if you just think about these people who their job is to manipulate the consciousness of masses of people.
[02:47:18.588 --> 02:47:20.189]  You want to build up, build up, build up.
[02:47:20.268 --> 02:47:26.048]   Have the Trump victory everybody celebrating the left goes crazy because you know they're they've got their riot squads
[02:47:26.048 --> 02:47:30.308]   And they'll activate them and then at the height of that madness if you assassinate Trump
[02:47:30.308 --> 02:47:36.627]   Then all of the people who thought they'd won are suddenly you know feeling like or they'll buy the victim
[02:47:36.627 --> 02:47:43.918]   Sorry, or they killed by to make him the victim Yeah, well that's the other possibility is you know they've
[02:47:43.918 --> 02:47:47.708]   been building up the the straw man of white supremacist terror for a very long time
[02:47:47.870 --> 02:47:48.711]  Yeah, I think they killed Biden.
[02:47:49.191 --> 02:47:51.172]  I'm going to get on record, I'm going to say it's going to happen.
[02:47:51.872 --> 02:47:53.573]  I think that's definitely in their playbook.
[02:47:54.934 --> 02:47:56.635]  Yeah, I don't disagree.
[02:47:56.655 --> 02:47:57.775]  The problem is nobody would miss him.
[02:47:58.176 --> 02:48:04.359]  And I'm not trying to say that, you know, cruelly, but he's not loved like a Julius Caesar was loved or Donald Trump or JFK.
[02:48:04.198 --> 02:48:06.198]   If they assassinate him, everyone will be like, "Oh, thank God."
[02:48:06.198 --> 02:48:07.198]  Yeah.
[02:48:07.198 --> 02:48:10.957]  Yeah, they'll still hide his shit out of it, though.
[02:48:10.957 --> 02:48:17.078]   I'm receiving messages from people that are monitoring the CNN post game, and they're
[02:48:17.078 --> 02:48:18.438]  just ripping Biden out.
[02:48:18.407 --> 02:48:23.590]  I mean, let's go to the live feed or CNN.
[02:48:23.690 --> 02:48:27.332]  They will wake up in the morning and they will do something else because this is not sustainable.
[02:48:27.372 --> 02:48:40.385]   That's another point about There are Democrats who are panicking, and then there are a lot of Republicans who did not want to vote for Donald Trump, who do not want to vote for Donald Trump, who are also panicking tonight.
[02:48:40.405 --> 02:48:44.329]  I heard from one who said, this is scary.
[02:48:44.769 --> 02:48:45.911]  That's how it was described.
[02:48:46.371 --> 02:48:46.671]  To me.
[02:48:46.892 --> 02:48:49.174]  I'd second that.
[02:48:49.214 --> 02:48:58.564]  There were a lot of those feelings, not just from the base of the party, but other people who really think that there should be an alternative to Trump who they think is dangerous.
[02:48:59.244 --> 02:49:03.829]  And that's the other part of what is unfolding tonight in terms of the panic that is out there.
[02:49:03.949 --> 02:49:09.506]   You already have, coming into this debate, Support for third-party candidates.
[02:49:09.886 --> 02:49:11.508]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., highest.
[02:49:11.988 --> 02:49:14.369]  And then Jill Stein and Cornel West, nowhere near as close.
[02:49:14.389 --> 02:49:17.472]  But if you add it all up, you get into the teens in most states when you do that.
[02:49:17.932 --> 02:49:21.514]  I think one byproduct out of this is watch and see if those numbers go up a little bit.
[02:49:21.734 --> 02:49:33.222]  I'm not saying they're going to go up anywhere like a Perot standard, but you get to third-party candidates getting into double digits, then that really starts to twist your electoral math, depending on who they're drawing from state by state.
[02:49:33.482 --> 02:49:35.023]  This was already a very complicated race.
[02:49:35.984 --> 02:49:39.605]  With it, number one, the biggest complication right now is the conversation with the Democratic Party.
[02:49:39.886 --> 02:49:44.627]  But the other complication is going to be if Joe Biden stays put, and Kate's right, maybe there'll be another debate.
[02:49:44.747 --> 02:49:46.788]  I'm not sure Donald Trump's going to agree to a second debate.
[02:49:47.329 --> 02:49:48.289]  Biden's going to need it now.
[02:49:48.589 --> 02:49:51.350]  I'm not sure Trump's going to agree to it if the dynamics of the race change.
[02:49:51.590 --> 02:49:52.971]  And I would also watch the third party.
[02:49:53.251 --> 02:49:54.912]  I just want to say one thing.
[02:49:55.972 --> 02:49:57.212]  Especially to you two guys.
[02:49:58.413 --> 02:50:13.895]   If, for whatever reason, there's a change at the top of the ticket, You guys are in trouble with Donald Trump because the guy who was up there tonight is not a guy who's going to inspire people.
[02:50:14.896 --> 02:50:23.598]  He did not show in any way that he has changed from the guy who people have a very positive opinion of for a lot of good reason.
[02:50:23.818 --> 02:50:27.439]  I think Donald Trump won several policy exchanges tonight.
[02:50:27.679 --> 02:50:29.080]  I think he did well on immigration.
[02:50:29.240 --> 02:50:30.740]  I think he did well on the economy.
[02:50:30.820 --> 02:50:32.741]  I think he did well on inflation.
[02:50:32.761 --> 02:50:34.962]  I think he went back to Afghanistan as he should have.
[02:50:35.462 --> 02:50:48.367]  The thing he did not do was after he realized that he had Biden beaten on policy and on image, he should have turned the page and sounded an optimistic note about what we can become as a people and as a country.
[02:50:48.407 --> 02:50:49.127]  He did not do that.
[02:50:49.167 --> 02:50:51.328]  He continued to pummel Joe Biden all night.
[02:50:51.408 --> 02:50:52.949]  I understand what you're saying.
[02:50:53.922 --> 02:50:59.105]  But at the end of the night, very few things about the policy exchanges is going to be remembered.
[02:50:59.485 --> 02:51:02.406]  People are going to remember Joe Biden shuffling out.
[02:51:02.666 --> 02:51:04.287]  They're going to remember him shuffling out.
[02:51:05.568 --> 02:51:07.989]  They're going to remember him staring blankly into the camera.
[02:51:08.449 --> 02:51:11.330]  They're going to remember him looking down, losing his train of thought.
[02:51:11.751 --> 02:51:17.994]  And they're going to remember that everything I thought I knew, but the White House told me don't believe my own eyes, is actually true.
[02:51:18.014 --> 02:51:19.114]  But that's not what I'm saying.
[02:51:19.134 --> 02:51:29.703]   What I said, Scott, was If Joe Biden were not the candidate, if there was another candidate, I think Donald Trump would be in deep trouble.
[02:51:30.283 --> 02:51:31.984]  That is such a sad state of affairs.
[02:51:32.004 --> 02:51:37.249]  Something I was consistently hearing is what a bad debate in the sense that Donald Trump lied throughout.
[02:51:37.289 --> 02:51:38.210]  He misrepresented.
[02:51:38.310 --> 02:51:39.251]  He tried to turn away.
[02:51:39.611 --> 02:51:42.994]  From key points that he should have given answers on and kept and kept deflecting.
[02:51:43.294 --> 02:51:47.617]  With any normal generic Democrat next to him, I don't think he would have won the night.
[02:51:47.938 --> 02:51:52.421]  But you put somebody who was suffering from the moment that they got out, it was hard to watch.
[02:51:52.501 --> 02:51:55.263]  I had to occasionally look away because it was so uncomfortable.
[02:51:55.704 --> 02:51:58.406]  I think America deserves better than the options that are in front of them.
[02:51:58.506 --> 02:51:59.547]  It's really devastating.
[02:51:59.567 --> 02:52:01.248]  And by the way, our allies are watching.
[02:52:01.448 --> 02:52:09.383]  Yeah, look, I mean, the way that I would try to phrase it if I were less emotional is Biden stuttered, but he told the truth.
[02:52:10.485 --> 02:52:11.247]  He looked terrible.
[02:52:11.648 --> 02:52:12.409]  Those policies were good.
[02:52:13.206 --> 02:52:15.489]  Trump spoke plainly, but he lied the whole time.
[02:52:16.289 --> 02:52:18.212]  And he looked good, but his policies were terrible.
[02:52:18.552 --> 02:52:20.734]  I mean, he's going to do nothing on climate change.
[02:52:20.774 --> 02:52:22.516]  He was hugging the cactus on abortion.
[02:52:22.577 --> 02:52:24.258]  I mean, his policies are terrible.
[02:52:24.559 --> 02:52:32.187]  So you have somebody who probably shouldn't be president, and you have somebody who cannot be president, in terms of what Donald Trump represents.
[02:52:32.468 --> 02:52:34.370]  So we have a problem as a country now.
[02:52:34.710 --> 02:52:45.615]  And this might be an opportunity for people to come together and figure this out, because neither one of those people right now are inspiring the confidence that they should inspire, that they can do the job in a way that would be good for the country.
[02:52:45.875 --> 02:52:55.659]  But young voters are up for grabs in this election, and I don't know a voter under 30 who would have watched tonight and could say, I have confidence in Joe Biden and casting my vote for four more years of Biden.
[02:52:56.131 --> 02:52:58.851]  And this opens the door, by the way, to the conversation.
[02:52:58.851 --> 02:53:00.050]  Live coverage here.
[02:53:00.050 --> 02:53:05.050]   We're about to cut in with a great broadcaster, Stephen Crowder, and their amazing operation
[02:53:05.050 --> 02:53:06.890]  in North Texas.
[02:53:06.890 --> 02:53:09.931]  Total bloodbath system, totally turning against Biden.
[02:53:09.931 --> 02:53:12.931]  Roger Stone vindicated they're about to remove Biden.
[02:53:12.931 --> 02:53:15.331]  This is totally insane.
[02:53:15.331 --> 02:53:16.690]  They're totally turning against him.
[02:53:16.690 --> 02:53:18.412]  I have no words to describe it.
[02:53:18.412 --> 02:53:19.412]  This was wild.
[02:53:19.412 --> 02:53:21.291]  Stephen Crowder, thanks for having me on.
[02:53:21.291 --> 02:53:22.291]  Good to have you here with us.
[02:53:22.291 --> 02:53:23.291]  Stephen Crowder.
[02:53:23.291 --> 02:53:24.291]  Absolutely.
[02:53:24.363 --> 02:53:29.624]  Mr. Jones, I know we're crossing the stream, so it got a little complicated, but I'm glad to have you on, sir.
[02:53:29.884 --> 02:53:31.385]  We're watching CNN right now.
[02:53:32.125 --> 02:53:35.445]  Look, I was not quite there, but I am now 70-30.
[02:53:35.866 --> 02:53:39.566]  After tonight, they swapped Biden because even CNN is saying this was a bloodbath.
[02:53:40.206 --> 02:53:41.087]  What was your read?
[02:53:41.247 --> 02:53:47.508]  I'm sure you're having fun, but I also think people need to be careful because they are going to get dirtier and darker between now and election because of the loss.
[02:53:48.368 --> 02:53:49.349]  No, I totally agree.
[02:53:49.509 --> 02:53:52.350]  I mean, they gave at least 12 minutes more to Biden.
[02:53:52.910 --> 02:53:54.631]  They rigged all the questions for Biden.
[02:53:55.232 --> 02:53:58.973]  But like Gladiator, where they stab Maximus, he still wins the fight.
[02:53:59.073 --> 02:54:03.436]  I mean, Trump literally dominated, just being cool cat.
[02:54:04.216 --> 02:54:07.937]  And now they're bloodbathing on CNN and every other channel saying get rid of him.
[02:54:08.257 --> 02:54:08.857]  But I agree.
[02:54:08.937 --> 02:54:11.557]  What are they going to pull next and who is it that they're about to bring in?
[02:54:11.897 --> 02:54:12.818]  Is it Gavin Newsom?
[02:54:13.498 --> 02:54:16.258]  Is it Hillary Clinton, which Washington Post says they should bring in?
[02:54:16.678 --> 02:54:17.438]  Is it Big Mike?
[02:54:17.859 --> 02:54:19.579]  I mean this is about to get a lot crazier.
[02:54:19.619 --> 02:54:24.360]  Will the deep state assassinate Biden and say that Trump supporters did it?
[02:54:25.140 --> 02:54:28.140]  I'm wargaming this in my own mind and that's what Alex Jones does.
[02:54:28.620 --> 02:54:31.441]  I'm saying I think they might kill Biden and blame Trump.
[02:54:33.195 --> 02:54:33.716]  Uh, okay.
[02:54:34.096 --> 02:54:39.082]  I'll give that a- I'll give that a- I know, you and Nick are just- Oh my god!
[02:54:39.182 --> 02:54:46.010]  I give it a 2% chance because here's the thing, I just think it's easier to make him go away without- they want to avoid the theatrics, they want this to be as quiet as possible.
[02:54:46.030 --> 02:54:49.695]  But it makes him a victim, they wanna- they gotta- okay, maybe you're right, but what do they do then, Steven?
[02:54:51.095 --> 02:54:53.818]  Well, I think they just point him south and hope for the best.
[02:54:53.898 --> 02:54:55.219]  This guy doesn't know where he is.
[02:54:55.239 --> 02:55:04.609]  I think that they want to do it quietly because, here's the thing, I think they want to parlay this, which is why they want to do it quietly, into their shenanigans that go into the election.
[02:55:04.649 --> 02:55:06.231]  They want it to take place in darkness.
[02:55:06.251 --> 02:55:09.875]  That's why CNN was threatening to remove any stream that fact-checked on tonight.
[02:55:10.375 --> 02:55:18.202]   Information is their enemy, and so I really do think If they have their choice, they want to do it quietly first, without drawing attention.
[02:55:18.222 --> 02:55:21.604]  Because they just made a big stink about taking democracy away from the American people.
[02:55:22.124 --> 02:55:23.565]  It's going to be really hard to have a leg to stand on.
[02:55:23.585 --> 02:55:23.845]  No, I agree.
[02:55:23.865 --> 02:55:25.126]  So they're going to remove him.
[02:55:25.186 --> 02:55:26.307]  Even Drudge says remove him.
[02:55:26.627 --> 02:55:27.408]  So who is it?
[02:55:27.468 --> 02:55:28.929]  The big question is, who is it?
[02:55:30.253 --> 02:55:39.579]  Gosh, I don't, you know, the one that I fear most, I will say this, is Gretchen Whitmer, because she's evil, and because, obviously, I'm from the state of Michigan.
[02:55:39.980 --> 02:55:41.881]  I think Gavin Newsom has too much baggage.
[02:55:42.361 --> 02:55:43.462]  I know I've heard Hillary Clinton.
[02:55:43.602 --> 02:55:47.825]  Obviously, she's the only person who's more unlikable than Kamala Harris.
[02:55:47.865 --> 02:55:50.767]  The one thing we can all agree on is it will not be Kamala Harris, right?
[02:55:50.787 --> 02:55:51.347]  There's no way.
[02:55:51.547 --> 02:55:52.048]  No, you're right.
[02:55:52.088 --> 02:55:53.028]  I forgot about Whitmer.
[02:55:53.068 --> 02:55:53.909]  They've been floating her.
[02:55:55.242 --> 02:55:57.424]  Yeah, and she checks that box as a woman.
[02:55:57.464 --> 02:55:58.805]  Gavin Newsom kind of screwed the pooch.
[02:55:58.845 --> 02:56:01.867]  I think they sort of feel like that's spent and maybe trot him out next time.
[02:56:02.348 --> 02:56:04.529]  Who do you think they're going to replace him with?
[02:56:04.549 --> 02:56:06.911]  Because I think we all agree it's very likely that they do.
[02:56:07.331 --> 02:56:10.274]  They're floating Newsom, but California's a disaster, you're right.
[02:56:10.294 --> 02:56:15.498]  They've been slowly under the radar floating Whitmer of Michigan.
[02:56:16.318 --> 02:56:18.260]  So I think that's, I forgot about that.
[02:56:18.280 --> 02:56:19.301]  I think that's actually a good point.
[02:56:20.081 --> 02:56:20.921]  Uh, but they're crazy.
[02:56:21.041 --> 02:56:21.501]  I don't know.
[02:56:21.621 --> 02:56:23.182]  I mean, as if people are going to buy that.
[02:56:23.682 --> 02:56:24.842]  What are they going to do?
[02:56:24.862 --> 02:56:27.883]  Like, they kept saying, will you question the election this time, Trump?
[02:56:28.203 --> 02:56:31.624]  That seemed like four times because, well, everybody questions elections.
[02:56:31.664 --> 02:56:37.285]  The State Department says in election monitoring worldwide that if you can't question an election, it's not a free election.
[02:56:37.645 --> 02:56:39.766]  So since when can we not question an election?
[02:56:41.191 --> 02:56:49.800]  Well, here's the funny thing to me is Joe Biden was using, you know, last year's talking points, and so is CNN, because YouTube has changed their policy, right?
[02:56:50.060 --> 02:56:52.202]  Where you are now allowed to question election results.
[02:56:52.282 --> 02:57:00.149]  And I believe the reason for that is the same reason we had an election commission, election integrity commission, headed by Carter, Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, right?
[02:57:00.450 --> 02:57:04.694]  Because they're planning on questioning the election because they know that they can't win it honestly.
[02:57:04.734 --> 02:57:05.875]  So that's an actual change.
[02:57:06.796 --> 02:57:11.246]  Exactly, they're having to back off from saying you can't question it because they're about to question it when Trump wins.
[02:57:12.441 --> 02:57:13.402]  Exactly.
[02:57:13.422 --> 02:57:18.286]  I think CNN was wrong to throw that out because pretty soon you're going to see them questioning the election.
[02:57:19.727 --> 02:57:22.689]  It's a bizarre, it really is a bizarre time.
[02:57:22.709 --> 02:57:29.275]  I think that he lost in those first three questions when he had that freeze and it was so nonsensical.
[02:57:29.295 --> 02:57:39.483]   And where I think that he also lost was, I always say this, I know that you did theater back in the day, acting away from the puck, right, your face, your reactions, it was so It was so genuine.
[02:57:39.804 --> 02:57:43.508]  Joe Biden was terrified, and Donald Trump looked like, I got him.
[02:57:43.749 --> 02:57:47.653]  You could tell that he felt like he was about to nail it, and that's something you can't just fake.
[02:57:47.693 --> 02:57:49.075]  You can't prep for that in a debate.
[02:57:49.415 --> 02:57:53.681]  The feeling that Trump seemed to display was that he was confident.
[02:57:53.701 --> 02:57:57.625]  Yeah, I don't think there's any doubt they've been routed, so we should all be asking, how do they strike back?
[02:57:58.426 --> 02:57:59.186]  That's the only question.
[02:57:59.226 --> 02:57:59.507]  You're right.
[02:57:59.807 --> 02:58:00.447]  What do they do now?
[02:58:00.687 --> 02:58:01.507]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[02:58:01.527 --> 02:58:02.828]  And I think it's a multi-pronged approach.
[02:58:02.848 --> 02:58:04.209]  I think they first try and swap him out.
[02:58:04.709 --> 02:58:07.010]  And then I think that they pull every trick they can.
[02:58:07.050 --> 02:58:10.271]  I think we're going to see media suppression big time of stories.
[02:58:12.672 --> 02:58:18.115]  They're going to be running, they're going to be doing this in overdrive to make it seem as though it was something that couldn't be prevented.
[02:58:18.555 --> 02:58:21.716]  Because I think that it looks really bad for them if they swap him out.
[02:58:21.736 --> 02:58:23.857]  And that is still a problem that they're going to have to deal with.
[02:58:24.317 --> 02:58:27.659]  And I think they can only do that through spin and through information suppression.
[02:58:27.839 --> 02:58:29.641]  No, I agree, but I don't think there's any doubt now.
[02:58:29.661 --> 02:58:31.103]  We can bring your co-host in on his take.
[02:58:31.123 --> 02:58:36.249]  I don't think there's any doubt they gotta get rid of him now, but then that itself is changing horses in the middle of the stream.
[02:58:36.629 --> 02:58:40.774]  This is an unmitigated train wreck, which makes it even more dangerous.
[02:58:40.934 --> 02:58:47.142]  So, all I can say is, anybody that claims we're not in exciting times, or anybody that claims things are boring, they're...
[02:58:48.383 --> 02:58:49.204]  They must be dead.
[02:58:49.244 --> 02:58:59.552]  Here's something else I will say, you know, Donald Trump is winning the vote under 30, I believe, by like 60%.
[02:58:59.812 --> 02:59:04.536]  He's winning Latinos right now, 46 to 40, and he's gained a significant portion of the black vote.
[02:59:04.816 --> 02:59:16.706]  And people will say as a white guy, this is racist, but as someone who spends a lot of time around these folks, whether it's in comedy or friends and family, Hispanic Americans and black Americans, they do have an inherent respect for strength.
[02:59:17.146 --> 02:59:21.027]  And they do feel uncomfortable around incompetence and someone who isn't in control.
[02:59:21.387 --> 02:59:26.948]  And I actually expect, think about Arizona, think about Michigan, think about the states where Donald Trump is already winning.
[02:59:27.268 --> 02:59:28.989]  And these little margins make a huge difference.
[02:59:29.109 --> 02:59:33.110]  I expect Donald Trump to make big gains with the black community and Hispanic community.
[02:59:33.210 --> 02:59:34.590]  I have a dirty guinea next to me.
[02:59:34.610 --> 02:59:35.110]  What do you think?
[02:59:35.130 --> 02:59:35.830]  You're half Sicilian.
[02:59:37.131 --> 02:59:42.132]  Is there like a liberal, maybe CEO, a billionaire that we don't know about?
[02:59:42.752 --> 02:59:43.733]  That's their only chance.
[02:59:43.753 --> 02:59:45.014]  They could pull out of nowhere.
[02:59:45.214 --> 02:59:45.875]  Like Bezos?
[02:59:45.935 --> 02:59:46.556]  There's somebody.
[02:59:46.956 --> 02:59:47.717]  There's gotta be somebody.
[02:59:47.737 --> 02:59:51.420]  Like a Bezos or somebody on that high profile.
[02:59:51.480 --> 02:59:52.321]  That's the only thing.
[02:59:52.861 --> 02:59:54.022]  That's their only shot.
[02:59:54.062 --> 02:59:55.183]  Mark Cuban or somebody like that?
[02:59:55.243 --> 02:59:55.984]  Mark Cuban.
[02:59:56.024 --> 02:59:57.045]  Yeah, somebody like that.
[02:59:57.205 --> 02:59:59.347]  Alex, I have a question for you on the timing.
[02:59:59.367 --> 03:00:02.730]  So I've been calling for a long time that Joe Biden wasn't going to...
[03:00:04.674 --> 03:00:06.016]  Back to you, Bob.
[03:00:06.156 --> 03:00:07.377]  I had a question on the timing.
[03:00:07.578 --> 03:00:11.102]  I've been saying this for a long time and Nick agrees that Joe Biden's not going to be the guy.
[03:00:11.262 --> 03:00:14.125]  Do you think they wait until after the convention to do that?
[03:00:14.586 --> 03:00:16.028]  Or do you think they do it before?
[03:00:16.818 --> 03:00:19.459]  I am not the master politico like Roger Stone.
[03:00:19.499 --> 03:00:20.579]  He's been saying it for three years.
[03:00:21.059 --> 03:00:22.619]  They'll replace him in Chicago.
[03:00:23.580 --> 03:00:25.100]  And so I think that's clear.
[03:00:25.220 --> 03:00:26.940]  You watch the bloodbath on CNN.
[03:00:27.260 --> 03:00:28.421]  They're all attacking him.
[03:00:28.461 --> 03:00:30.141]  The knives are out like he's Julius Caesar.
[03:00:31.061 --> 03:00:34.342]  So no, I mean, I think they replace him and say Joe's got an illness.
[03:00:34.602 --> 03:00:35.943]  Remember, Joe said he was running.
[03:00:36.243 --> 03:00:38.323]  If I don't do a good job, I'll have an illness and disappear.
[03:00:38.763 --> 03:00:40.144]  So I think that was always kind of the plan.
[03:00:40.184 --> 03:00:41.884]  He's the third administration of Obama.
[03:00:42.525 --> 03:00:49.398]  And so I think, I think, I'm predicting you will see him step down at the VNC of Chicago in July.
[03:00:51.067 --> 03:00:52.749]  Let me make a statement here, okay?
[03:00:53.129 --> 03:00:53.530]  Let's all hear it.
[03:00:53.570 --> 03:00:58.174]  If that happens, I've said this before in the past, Mr. Jones, I've said, you know what?
[03:00:58.655 --> 03:01:12.749]  I feel like Alex and I have come closer together because Alex has really sort of espoused Christian conservatism more now, and I actually go, oh geez, Alex was right about a lot, you know, whereas if you were to ask me ten years ago, like, that's conspiratorial!
[03:01:13.409 --> 03:01:18.610]   If they replace him, the last vestiges of my faith in the American political
[03:01:18.610 --> 03:01:24.320]   system as it relates to certainly the left, where I think there at least is some sense of decorum, will
[03:01:24.320 --> 03:01:25.050]  be gone.
[03:01:25.050 --> 03:01:31.850]   Honestly, I will probably be further to the right than you, because I maintain like, "Hey, you know what? I still think
[03:01:31.850 --> 03:01:32.750]  he's going to be the guy."
[03:01:32.750 --> 03:01:36.250]   And I will be eating some crow. I'll be eating some humble pie,
[03:01:36.250 --> 03:01:40.750]   because I thought they had to stick with Biden, because they still had to maintain the appearance of it.
[03:01:40.841 --> 03:01:46.706]  If they swap him out, that means they genuinely do not care about the will of the American people, and I will admit it.
[03:01:46.986 --> 03:01:49.529]  Well, Steven, I don't think you're wrong, probably.
[03:01:49.549 --> 03:01:53.833]  I mean, when Roger three years ago said they will replace him, I was like, yeah, right.
[03:01:54.393 --> 03:01:56.475]  It's just I saw them totally turn against him tonight.
[03:01:58.277 --> 03:01:59.919]  But it is crazy to replace him.
[03:02:00.299 --> 03:02:01.120]  It's even more desperate.
[03:02:01.140 --> 03:02:02.182]  So I'd say 50-50.
[03:02:02.202 --> 03:02:03.964]  I'm not trying to hedge my bets.
[03:02:04.364 --> 03:02:05.706]  I literally don't know what's going to happen.
[03:02:06.146 --> 03:02:07.688]  I just know they are bleeding out.
[03:02:08.108 --> 03:02:09.330]  They are exploding.
[03:02:10.251 --> 03:02:11.252]  It's like a race car.
[03:02:11.312 --> 03:02:13.955]  Its engine blows up and fire shoots out and it blows up.
[03:02:14.035 --> 03:02:15.657]  I mean, they just blew up.
[03:02:16.198 --> 03:02:17.419]  So I don't know what they're going to do.
[03:02:17.519 --> 03:02:19.061]  So the question is, what are they going to do?
[03:02:21.089 --> 03:02:23.191]  I don't know what they will do as far as how they replace him.
[03:02:23.351 --> 03:02:31.177]  I do know that it's going to get dirtier, it's going to get worse, it's going to get really rough between now and election, because they are not going to give this one up.
[03:02:31.337 --> 03:02:35.581]  They've taken every legal avenue and illegal avenue to try and prevent the use of the elected people.
[03:02:35.621 --> 03:02:40.144]  Oh, Maxine Waters is on the news every day saying Trump supporters are training the woods to kill black people.
[03:02:40.564 --> 03:02:41.105]  Now, look.
[03:02:42.643 --> 03:02:45.464]  What conservatives are really trading in the woods to kill black people?
[03:02:45.804 --> 03:02:54.627]  No, I believe from just what they're saying, they're trying to provocateur lunatics, like with the Whitmer kidnapping, but much worse, to stage something.
[03:02:54.687 --> 03:03:02.289]  I think that's very clear, that's their saving grace, that's their due sex, that's their secret plan, that's their October surprise.
[03:03:02.809 --> 03:03:08.691]  I'm saying right now, from what I've seen, they're planning to provocateur lunatics to go shoot up black churches.
[03:03:09.946 --> 03:03:10.566]  Yeah, but you know what?
[03:03:10.926 --> 03:03:17.349]  Even the lunatics right now, if anyone was thinking about assassinating Joe Biden after tonight, the lunatics are saying, HOLD!
[03:03:17.849 --> 03:03:18.389]  WAIT!
[03:03:18.629 --> 03:03:19.389]  They know.
[03:03:19.669 --> 03:03:20.089]  I agree.
[03:03:20.910 --> 03:03:27.432]  Because people are aware of false flags, and aware of being provocative from Jan 6, and the Whitmer kidnapping plan, I agree.
[03:03:27.832 --> 03:03:41.539]   Like the Whitmer, people don't know, there was three trials that were found guilty in the third trial, but the two trials they weren't, and it turned out the majority were FBI leaders Getting potheads giving them money to just say you're gonna go kidnap the governor.
[03:03:42.119 --> 03:03:49.525]  And so yeah, people now know when they're like a pothead, some guy offers them $10,000 to say they're gonna kill Biden, they're like, you're a fed.
[03:03:50.205 --> 03:03:54.789]  So I think because there's that awareness, they're losing that power because we're not as naive as we were.
[03:03:56.095 --> 03:03:56.595]  I think you're right.
[03:03:56.616 --> 03:04:00.078]  And so everyone here, including you Alex, everyone here, let's all make a pact on air.
[03:04:00.799 --> 03:04:02.320]  No more kidnapping governors.
[03:04:02.400 --> 03:04:03.141]  That's right.
[03:04:03.181 --> 03:04:03.782]  Back to my question.
[03:04:03.802 --> 03:04:04.903]  Hold on, it just depends.
[03:04:05.123 --> 03:04:06.184]  That was ignored.
[03:04:06.264 --> 03:04:06.744]  I'm sorry.
[03:04:06.804 --> 03:04:08.526]  It wasn't ignored, it was overshadowed.
[03:04:09.186 --> 03:04:10.127]  Okay, it was overshadowed.
[03:04:12.219 --> 03:04:19.522]  Don't you think, Alex, how about a Bezos or a Mark Cuban, kind of a high-profile business guy who leans left?
[03:04:19.742 --> 03:04:21.542]  Isn't that their only legitimate shot?
[03:04:21.962 --> 03:04:23.343]  I think that's really a smart point.
[03:04:23.383 --> 03:04:28.865]  I hadn't thought of that, but now that you say it, I think, yeah, they might bring in a Bloomberg or a Mark Cuban.
[03:04:28.985 --> 03:04:29.545]  Absolutely.
[03:04:29.585 --> 03:04:31.266]  I mean, they're going to pull something.
[03:04:31.286 --> 03:04:33.106]  I don't think any of it's going to work.
[03:04:33.186 --> 03:04:37.988]  So we are about the next 130 days to be the most exciting time of life.
[03:04:38.088 --> 03:04:40.289]  So it's an amazing time to be alive.
[03:04:41.311 --> 03:04:41.511]  Yeah.
[03:04:41.651 --> 03:04:42.812]  No, I agree with you there.
[03:04:43.032 --> 03:04:49.437]  And I think it's also, as people who do what we do, one of the most dangerous times to do what we do.
[03:04:49.497 --> 03:04:53.900]  Because tonight, CNN started saying they're going to remove any live facts.
[03:04:54.020 --> 03:04:56.502]  I bet you they're going to stop that because they know it's a disaster.
[03:04:56.802 --> 03:04:57.963]  They want to keep their powder dry.
[03:04:58.644 --> 03:05:01.106]  By the way, just to interrupt you, that shows how desperate they are.
[03:05:01.146 --> 03:05:01.286]  Yeah.
[03:05:01.626 --> 03:05:05.529]  Three days ago, they sent notices out to everybody saying, you can't cover it.
[03:05:05.809 --> 03:05:06.890]  You can't show clips.
[03:05:07.390 --> 03:05:07.971]  Fair use.
[03:05:07.991 --> 03:05:09.192]  Elon Musk said, screw you.
[03:05:10.112 --> 03:05:10.673]  Exactly.
[03:05:10.853 --> 03:05:11.973]  It's fair use, folks.
[03:05:12.073 --> 03:05:15.596]  Political speech is the most open speech for commentary.
[03:05:15.956 --> 03:05:16.637]  It's a hundred percent.
[03:05:16.757 --> 03:05:17.317]  Exactly.
[03:05:17.797 --> 03:05:26.043]  So I interrupt you, Stephen, but yeah, what are they going to do with their attempt to try to tell us we can't respond to that train wreck?
[03:05:27.403 --> 03:05:28.043]  Well, here's what they do.
[03:05:28.063 --> 03:05:31.184]  They make it really clear, Alex, is that first they demonetize you.
[03:05:31.204 --> 03:05:33.185]  That's what happened with us, where they say, you can't make any money.
[03:05:33.265 --> 03:05:34.626]  And we say, OK, we'll take that on the chin.
[03:05:34.946 --> 03:05:36.226]  Then they say, we're going to shadow ban you.
[03:05:36.246 --> 03:05:37.067]  We're going to throttle you.
[03:05:37.447 --> 03:05:46.030]  And then when you create an alternative platform, for example, what we've done with Mug Club and Rumble, they say, well, we're just going to sue you and go after you legally, as they've done with you, by the way.
[03:05:46.050 --> 03:05:51.973]   And I do mean a political persecution to prevent, to try and prevent you from making a living At all.
[03:05:52.153 --> 03:05:52.853]  That's the order.
[03:05:52.933 --> 03:05:53.734]  Demonetize.
[03:05:53.834 --> 03:05:55.555]  If it's not enough, de-platform.
[03:05:55.675 --> 03:05:56.695]  You have another platform?
[03:05:56.956 --> 03:06:02.099]  Remove that platform through legal avenues to ensure you can't make a living ever again.
[03:06:02.119 --> 03:06:05.901]  Just imagine if someone came into your farm and said, I'm taking your crops away from you.
[03:06:06.221 --> 03:06:07.402]  That's what's really happening.
[03:06:07.422 --> 03:06:08.563]  It's just a digital version of that.
[03:06:09.702 --> 03:06:11.423]  I agree, but it's a sign of their weakness.
[03:06:11.443 --> 03:06:13.624]  As long as we don't bow down or back down, we're going to win.
[03:06:14.124 --> 03:06:15.165]  Which is another question.
[03:06:15.245 --> 03:06:18.887]  Trump gets in, we've got to make sure he doesn't put a bunch of jerks in.
[03:06:18.907 --> 03:06:19.667]  He's not perfect.
[03:06:20.448 --> 03:06:23.029]  He believes in politicos.
[03:06:23.329 --> 03:06:24.430]  Let's war game this real quick.
[03:06:25.130 --> 03:06:26.611]  Trump wins in 130 days.
[03:06:26.831 --> 03:06:31.634]  What does the deep state do in that 79 days before he's inaugurated January 20th?
[03:06:31.954 --> 03:06:35.056]  And then once Trump gets in, how do we then hold his feet to the fire?
[03:06:37.257 --> 03:06:39.274]  Well, you know, like you said, you're not a politico.
[03:06:40.933 --> 03:06:42.254]  I'm really concerned about the media.
[03:06:42.334 --> 03:06:46.758]  I'm really concerned about the entertainment industry, where they're going to try and change public opinion and warp everything he says.
[03:06:46.818 --> 03:06:53.823]  So, we're going to see a lot more of him saying, you know, I'm not talking about neo-Nazis, white supremacists who I condemn totally, and them say fine people on both sides.
[03:06:54.123 --> 03:06:59.587]  When he says, make your voices heard peacefully and patriotically, then they say he called people to violence on January 6th.
[03:06:59.687 --> 03:07:09.374]  And the reason that I focus on that is because those are the talk, people don't realize this, it was the media's false talking points that Kinzinger and Cheney knew were wrong.
[03:07:09.694 --> 03:07:12.937]  That allowed them to withhold evidence and imprison Americans.
[03:07:13.337 --> 03:07:15.059]  So if we... No, they're gonna lie if it works.
[03:07:15.219 --> 03:07:15.579]  Exactly.
[03:07:15.599 --> 03:07:23.226]  Like a week ago, MSNBC puts out an undercover Roger Stone video at Mar-a-Lago, where he goes, if they steal the election, we're gonna challenge it.
[03:07:23.506 --> 03:07:26.489]  And the headline is, Roger Stone launches plan to steal election.
[03:07:26.909 --> 03:07:30.793]  They even, they show the truth, but the headline is totally different.
[03:07:32.338 --> 03:07:35.883]  Yeah, I think the only difference this time is the people are aware.
[03:07:35.923 --> 03:07:37.165]  Trump has his record now.
[03:07:37.546 --> 03:07:43.174]  The people are especially after what Alvin Bragg tried to pull and it backfired in their face.
[03:07:43.555 --> 03:07:48.222]  So I think any more shenanigans on their part is just going to backfire even more.
[03:07:48.302 --> 03:07:51.164]  But that's why they need the media and the entertainment industry.
[03:07:51.204 --> 03:07:55.947]  The deep state is testicle-less without the media.
[03:07:56.067 --> 03:07:57.829]  But I'm saying people see through the media now.
[03:07:58.629 --> 03:08:00.691]  Well, they do, but then you see CNN.
[03:08:00.751 --> 03:08:01.331]  Here's what happens.
[03:08:01.371 --> 03:08:02.092]  Here's the problem, right?
[03:08:02.132 --> 03:08:02.872]  And Alex, you know this.
[03:08:03.933 --> 03:08:12.459]  CNN, News Corp, whoever it is, Turner, they go ABC, when you talk about NBC, Universal, ABC, Disney, they spend a bunch of money.
[03:08:12.739 --> 03:08:14.220]  Yeah, that's the issue.
[03:08:14.280 --> 03:08:16.622]  Yeah, we're dominating news, but only 10% of people watch news.
[03:08:16.541 --> 03:08:20.621]   anymore to then dictate policy and say we don't have a stranglehold so we're simply
[03:08:20.621 --> 03:08:23.981]  going to silence everyone else.
[03:08:23.981 --> 03:08:27.662]  We're dominating news, but only 10% of people watch news.
[03:08:27.662 --> 03:08:34.100]   You're right, Steven, it's the movies, entertainment, where they're going to put the lies out.
[03:08:34.100 --> 03:08:36.181]  And they have to, and then you'll have political...
[03:08:36.181 --> 03:08:37.181]  You know this, right?
[03:08:37.319 --> 03:08:39.622]  I've had to be in depositions, right?
[03:08:39.882 --> 03:08:46.449]  There are trials that take place where the evidence listed is a quote from a news article, and it's taken as though it's authoritative.
[03:08:46.469 --> 03:08:47.971]  These people work hand-in-hand.
[03:08:48.311 --> 03:08:49.593]  It's what they did with Donald Trump.
[03:08:49.613 --> 03:08:50.173]  Oh, they do it to me.
[03:08:50.193 --> 03:08:52.656]  They go, here's a news quote that you admit you're an actor.
[03:08:52.676 --> 03:08:54.238]  I'm like, where's the video?
[03:08:54.258 --> 03:08:54.959]  It never said it.
[03:08:55.419 --> 03:08:57.560]  I've been an actor in movies, but I'm not an actor on air.
[03:08:57.800 --> 03:09:00.181]  They go, oh, you're fake.
[03:09:00.321 --> 03:09:01.221]  You're an actor.
[03:09:01.581 --> 03:09:02.241]  I never said it.
[03:09:02.681 --> 03:09:03.602]  But they just say that.
[03:09:03.682 --> 03:09:03.842]  Right.
[03:09:05.102 --> 03:09:05.262]  Right.
[03:09:05.502 --> 03:09:10.644]  Just like Joe Biden today, his whole defense was, I know a bunch of people who say, worst president ever.
[03:09:10.924 --> 03:09:11.224]  Really?
[03:09:11.464 --> 03:09:14.585]  Who gives a... I won't say what I was going to say.
[03:09:14.805 --> 03:09:15.705]  Who gives a rat's ass?
[03:09:15.785 --> 03:09:16.206]  Who gives a fuck?
[03:09:20.845 --> 03:09:24.046]  Who gives a shit what some guy said to Biden?
[03:09:24.506 --> 03:09:25.106]  No one cares.
[03:09:25.347 --> 03:09:26.527]  The results speak for themselves.
[03:09:26.567 --> 03:09:28.108]  So everything has to be anecdotal.
[03:09:28.468 --> 03:09:29.748]  Everything has to be someone else said it.
[03:09:29.788 --> 03:10:02.029]   But I'm telling you, if you strip the media and the entertainment industry of their power, the deep state doesn't have as much of it because That's their reference point.
[03:10:02.379 --> 03:10:04.380]  Because CNN's had no viewers for years.
[03:10:04.780 --> 03:10:06.720]  Tonight, yeah, they probably get Super Bowl numbers.
[03:10:07.120 --> 03:10:08.600]  But why were they giving it?
[03:10:08.700 --> 03:10:09.781]  I don't understand it.
[03:10:11.081 --> 03:10:12.841]  I don't either, Alex, but a couple of points.
[03:10:13.001 --> 03:10:16.522]  One, it's shows like ours and yours that are going to hold people's feet to the fire.
[03:10:16.542 --> 03:10:23.363]  It's going to hold Trump's feet to the fire when he says he's going to do certain things when he gets into office and making sure that those things actually happen.
[03:10:23.403 --> 03:10:26.344]  And number two, speaking of stuff in the media, man, we got your back.
[03:10:26.744 --> 03:10:28.505]  Anything that's going on that we can help with, man.
[03:10:28.525 --> 03:10:29.045]  We love you.
[03:10:29.105 --> 03:10:29.925]  We support you.
[03:10:29.945 --> 03:10:32.446]  We want to make sure that you have a voice in this election.
[03:10:32.946 --> 03:10:35.967]  So anything that we can do, we will make sure that we do it.
[03:10:36.007 --> 03:10:37.508]  Mug Club has your back 100%.
[03:10:37.588 --> 03:10:40.309]  We've got your back, Gerald Morgan, Captain Morgan.
[03:10:40.329 --> 03:10:40.989]  But I want to say this.
[03:10:41.729 --> 03:10:45.491]  In the ecosystem, there's only like 10 people.
[03:10:45.971 --> 03:10:47.832]  And I'm not trying to... I want more competition.
[03:10:48.052 --> 03:10:49.352]  I'm not saying this to put people down.
[03:10:49.632 --> 03:10:51.053]  There's a lot of other sub-hosts of people.
[03:10:51.971 --> 03:11:01.076]  But there's only so many Joe Rogans and Steven Crowders and Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson's out there.
[03:11:01.417 --> 03:11:02.377]  There's like 10 of them.
[03:11:02.677 --> 03:11:04.759]  And we have almost the entire audience, which is great.
[03:11:05.259 --> 03:11:08.661]  If you look at us compared to corporate media, we have 50 times the viewers.
[03:11:09.001 --> 03:11:09.982]  That's why they're so scared.
[03:11:10.002 --> 03:11:11.382]  They want to keep acting like it's not happening.
[03:11:11.843 --> 03:11:19.967]  But I see our victory as when there's 100 hosts that know what we know, because we're trying to like transmit that knowledge to them.
[03:11:20.928 --> 03:11:24.730]  To me, it's about educating other people to transcend this.
[03:11:25.050 --> 03:11:30.812]  And I've got your back too, but people need to understand, there's not many people reaching 5 million people a day or 10 million like you are.
[03:11:31.172 --> 03:11:32.693]  It's not about an ass-kissing contest.
[03:11:32.793 --> 03:11:33.593]  It's real, folks.
[03:11:34.194 --> 03:11:35.074]  I reached 10 million.
[03:11:35.154 --> 03:11:35.994]  You reached 10 million.
[03:11:36.414 --> 03:11:38.395]  That's why the system is so scared.
[03:11:38.735 --> 03:11:49.820]  But the good news is, Elon's not perfect, but the fact that he's moving to us so fast shows, whether he's opportunistic or not, he sees where the wind is blowing.
[03:11:51.288 --> 03:11:52.169]  Yeah, no, I think you're right.
[03:11:52.189 --> 03:11:55.931]  And you do reach those people, and that's why, like I've said, they've gone through the sequence, right?
[03:11:56.011 --> 03:11:59.673]  And right now they're at the final phase to try and silence you by any means necessary.
[03:12:00.073 --> 03:12:02.615]  And everyone watching right now, you can hold our feet to the fire.
[03:12:02.655 --> 03:12:03.275]  Hey, guess what?
[03:12:03.375 --> 03:12:07.778]  We'll take a removal from YouTube if that means that we... They haven't struck us yet.
[03:12:07.978 --> 03:12:09.819]  They haven't struck us yet, but we will host Alex.
[03:12:09.859 --> 03:12:14.441]  In other words, I don't know what happens here in these next couple of weeks, if you guys haven't been following what's been going on with Alex Jones.
[03:12:14.822 --> 03:12:19.164]  Whatever happens, we'll take the strikes, we'll have you on, because they just want us.
[03:12:19.324 --> 03:12:23.186]  And Alex, I know they're coming for us next, because they already are.
[03:12:23.686 --> 03:12:25.527]  So believe me, it's not loss on us.
[03:12:25.547 --> 03:12:28.869]  No, we're all in this together, and I can't give the inside baseball, but that's exactly what it is.
[03:12:29.429 --> 03:12:30.830]  I swore to be loyal to my crew.
[03:12:31.370 --> 03:12:32.691]  I thought we'd be shut down months ago.
[03:12:33.111 --> 03:12:36.393]  And now this federal judge keeps blocking them, so I'm like, uh-oh.
[03:12:37.427 --> 03:12:41.528]  And I don't want to go away, I don't want to give up, but it keeps, I mean, this is insane.
[03:12:41.608 --> 03:12:45.370]  And the rollercoaster to me and my family and the crew, I feel so sorry for them.
[03:12:45.690 --> 03:12:50.031]  Every week, they tried to send the county to shut us down two weeks ago.
[03:12:50.251 --> 03:12:51.972]  They tried to lock the doors three weeks ago.
[03:12:52.412 --> 03:12:56.033]  And it's all, and the fact is we're fighting back.
[03:12:56.053 --> 03:13:01.035]  So listeners go, well, wait, the news says you're shut down today, but you're not because we're fighting back.
[03:13:01.335 --> 03:13:03.576]  But I don't expect this attack to be here much longer.
[03:13:04.116 --> 03:13:05.117]  So I'm glad you guys there.
[03:13:05.137 --> 03:13:06.398]  I'll be a guest on your show and stuff.
[03:13:06.718 --> 03:13:07.398]  I'm not a pussy.
[03:13:07.438 --> 03:13:08.079]  I'm not giving up.
[03:13:08.499 --> 03:13:10.380]  I don't think of myself as that powerful.
[03:13:10.861 --> 03:13:16.725]  I am getting my ass literally attacked by King Kong because our message is powerful, folks.
[03:13:17.085 --> 03:13:24.069]  And that's why you've got to support the Mug Club and support everybody else telling the truth, because they wouldn't be attacking us if this didn't threaten them.
[03:13:24.350 --> 03:13:26.251]  But at the same time, I'm like the Alamo here, man.
[03:13:26.531 --> 03:13:29.253]  I'm getting overrun right now, but I feel good about it.
[03:13:30.033 --> 03:13:30.634]  I'm a man.
[03:13:30.914 --> 03:13:33.656]  But at the same time, it is it is crazy.
[03:13:34.956 --> 03:13:37.117]  Well, look, anything you need, place a call.
[03:13:37.177 --> 03:13:38.958]  Right now, we're still actually on YouTube.
[03:13:38.978 --> 03:13:43.279]  Funny enough, tonight Rumble servers crashed because we had a quarter million concurrent live viewers.
[03:13:43.299 --> 03:13:43.600]  Amazing.
[03:13:44.020 --> 03:13:52.803]  It came back, but where's the best place right now just to stick it to the homos in Palo Alto where people can go and watch and support you?
[03:13:53.935 --> 03:13:59.296]   Real Alex Jones on X, Infowars.com/show. That's a great point you make. I remember I've been on Joe's show many
[03:13:59.296 --> 03:14:00.175]  times, Joe Rogan.
[03:14:00.175 --> 03:14:06.175]   I remember seven years ago on his show, he never hit 100,000 live at one time.
[03:14:06.175 --> 03:14:10.415]   And he got like 50 million views that week on that one interview.
[03:14:10.436 --> 03:14:13.500]  And he goes, oh my god, at the end of the show, we just had 100,000.
[03:14:13.860 --> 03:14:17.505]  You had a quarter million people on just that stream.
[03:14:17.925 --> 03:14:20.989]  That is holy grail stuff, folks, on Rumble.
[03:14:21.029 --> 03:14:22.511]  So we're not mad at Rumble.
[03:14:22.571 --> 03:14:23.572]  We're glad they're building up.
[03:14:23.612 --> 03:14:25.054]  We're glad they're doing good.
[03:14:25.154 --> 03:14:25.674]  It's awesome.
[03:14:26.475 --> 03:14:28.397]  And so yeah, I mean that's it folks.
[03:14:28.878 --> 03:14:30.900]  Just support the shows that are under attack.
[03:14:31.280 --> 03:14:33.543]  And the shows that are the lead elephants because we're under attack.
[03:14:33.843 --> 03:14:34.844]  Support the Mug Club.
[03:14:35.144 --> 03:14:37.327]  Support Steven Crowder and his great crew.
[03:14:37.387 --> 03:14:38.648]  Support us at InfoWars.
[03:14:39.108 --> 03:14:40.470]  InfoWars.com is still here.
[03:14:40.490 --> 03:14:42.792]  And I tell the crew every week they still stay here.
[03:14:43.693 --> 03:14:45.694]  I'm just like, well, I swore I wouldn't leave.
[03:14:45.734 --> 03:14:48.216]  I thought we'd be shut down a month ago, and then we're not.
[03:14:48.236 --> 03:15:00.363]  So I kind of have this promise to the crew, and I'm not like wishing we're going to get shut down, but I'm kind of like, you know, it just it's become such a roller coaster soap opera that my eyes are crossed at this point.
[03:15:00.423 --> 03:15:02.084]  So it's an epic moment.
[03:15:02.425 --> 03:15:05.366]  But Infowars is hard to kill, but we're right there at the edge.
[03:15:05.887 --> 03:15:06.887]  And so that's where we are.
[03:15:06.927 --> 03:15:07.848]  Thank you so much, guys.
[03:15:09.332 --> 03:15:09.773]  Absolutely.
[03:15:09.833 --> 03:15:15.779]  Brave people are difficult to kill and more useful in general, and we appreciate it, Alex.
[03:15:15.819 --> 03:15:17.400]  I know you have your own show to go back to.
[03:15:17.761 --> 03:15:18.922]  We'll be back in touch soon, Alex.
[03:15:18.942 --> 03:15:19.262]  I'm gonna end it.
[03:15:19.282 --> 03:15:19.783]  We love you, Alex Seaman.
[03:15:19.803 --> 03:15:20.083]  Thank you.
[03:15:21.444 --> 03:15:21.765]  Absolutely.
[03:15:21.845 --> 03:15:22.806]  Alex Jones, everybody!
[03:15:24.693 --> 03:15:25.694]  Alright, there goes Steven Crowder.
[03:15:26.255 --> 03:15:29.278]  Yeah, I mean, look, I haven't even talked about this today, folks.
[03:15:29.338 --> 03:15:33.042]  There was an incredible court hearing this morning, and it was so insane.
[03:15:33.082 --> 03:15:36.787]  The judge said, to the other side, you've committed crimes, you tried to seize the company again.
[03:15:36.807 --> 03:15:40.210]  And I'm like, I feel like I'm like the boy crying wolf.
[03:15:40.851 --> 03:15:42.893]  I have like 17 werewolves attacking me.
[03:15:43.414 --> 03:15:46.817]  I mean, you know, because God keeps keeping us going.
[03:15:47.237 --> 03:15:49.139]  And I'm on air like, they're trying to lock the doors.
[03:15:49.159 --> 03:15:49.880]  And then we stop them.
[03:15:49.900 --> 03:15:52.703]  And then you see the filing, shut us down, shut us down.
[03:15:52.723 --> 03:15:54.485]  And the marshals are coming.
[03:15:54.625 --> 03:15:55.566]  And then it doesn't happen.
[03:15:56.227 --> 03:15:58.969]  And then like the judge today said, no, you're not shutting it down.
[03:15:59.009 --> 03:16:00.110]  I've got the articles right here.
[03:16:01.075 --> 03:16:02.876]  And I don't want to sit here and talk about me all day.
[03:16:02.916 --> 03:16:03.777]  You know, they brought it up.
[03:16:04.037 --> 03:16:07.619]  I mean, like, you know, I mean, the one thing I've got is my integrity, folks.
[03:16:07.699 --> 03:16:08.579]  I've got integrity.
[03:16:09.040 --> 03:16:10.200]  Like, I'm a straight shooter.
[03:16:10.520 --> 03:16:11.261]  I love everybody.
[03:16:11.281 --> 03:16:16.304]  And I'm sitting here, like, I love God.
[03:16:17.645 --> 03:16:18.385]  I love God a lot.
[03:16:19.185 --> 03:16:20.226]  And God is all-powerful.
[03:16:20.306 --> 03:16:21.307]  I try to understand God.
[03:16:21.387 --> 03:16:24.709]  I'm like, God, what is this yo-yo thing?
[03:16:25.189 --> 03:16:26.109]  And then I kind of get it.
[03:16:26.149 --> 03:16:28.411]  God's like, we're making a huge spectacle out of you, boy.
[03:16:29.107 --> 03:16:30.007]  Wanna fight New World Order?
[03:16:30.027 --> 03:16:31.568]  I'm gonna give them what they want.
[03:16:31.708 --> 03:16:37.370]  And I'm like, when I finally realize God's in control, I sit back and I go, holy hell, God is real.
[03:16:37.730 --> 03:16:44.213]  They are literally yo-yoing us in front of the world like God ain't gonna let us get blown up easily.
[03:16:44.233 --> 03:16:45.233]  Maybe he keeps us going.
[03:16:45.974 --> 03:16:46.394]  I don't know.
[03:16:47.358 --> 03:16:47.758]  I don't know.
[03:16:48.219 --> 03:16:48.979]  But enough about me.
[03:16:49.239 --> 03:16:55.804]  But I've got New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, AP, Reuters, with them saying, we don't want money, we want Alex Jones shut down.
[03:16:56.125 --> 03:17:00.028]  And the judge said, you don't destroy value just because you hate somebody.
[03:17:00.288 --> 03:17:01.188]  You've committed crimes.
[03:17:01.509 --> 03:17:02.590]  That was today.
[03:17:03.030 --> 03:17:04.871]  I have the transcript.
[03:17:06.292 --> 03:17:09.395]  I mean, this is cuckoo level.
[03:17:10.219 --> 03:17:12.040]  And I'm a Machiavellian if I have to be.
[03:17:12.720 --> 03:17:14.081]  Shut us down, we even bigger.
[03:17:14.541 --> 03:17:15.641]  But God won't let that happen.
[03:17:15.721 --> 03:17:17.202]  And I've not ever backed down.
[03:17:17.242 --> 03:17:20.423]  I've never backed down just lost to like be a pussy.
[03:17:20.443 --> 03:17:27.446]  But at the same time, I'm like... They tried to shut us down in five filings in four weeks.
[03:17:28.046 --> 03:17:29.127]  They tried to close the doors.
[03:17:30.047 --> 03:17:30.807]  It's all over the news.
[03:17:30.847 --> 03:17:31.808]  We're shut down tomorrow.
[03:17:32.228 --> 03:17:32.988]  And it doesn't happen.
[03:17:33.028 --> 03:17:36.850]  I'm like... This is crazy.
[03:17:38.217 --> 03:17:39.738]  I don't want to talk about myself anymore.
[03:17:39.798 --> 03:17:44.561]  Tomorrow, if we're still on air, God knows what will happen, I will try to cover this.
[03:17:44.581 --> 03:17:51.685]  But I want to go to Robert Barnes, one of my best friends, really admire him, constitutional lawyer, great mind on this.
[03:17:51.705 --> 03:17:53.967]  Do not talk about me, even though it's very interesting.
[03:17:55.408 --> 03:17:59.170]  Let's talk about Trump because we need to unpack what happened tonight.
[03:17:59.230 --> 03:18:02.472]  This was a devastating round.
[03:18:03.933 --> 03:18:04.833]  This was historical.
[03:18:05.194 --> 03:18:07.055]  The whole system, we showed you some of it.
[03:18:08.851 --> 03:18:12.314]  From CNN to MSNBC to Drudge Report, totally turning against Biden.
[03:18:14.235 --> 03:18:15.176]  What is really going on?
[03:18:15.657 --> 03:18:17.538]  Robert Barnes, you've got your ear to the ground.
[03:18:17.718 --> 03:18:19.279]  What the hell did we just watch?
[03:18:20.721 --> 03:18:30.048]  Well, I think we saw Trump, the most focused he has been in a debate since that very first Republican debate, where Megyn Kelly was subscribed to take him out.
[03:18:30.529 --> 03:18:35.773]  And he took her out and took Rupert Murdoch out with the very first answer to the very first question.
[03:18:36.625 --> 03:18:38.927]  And tonight he was very much on his game.
[03:18:38.987 --> 03:18:39.808]  He stayed disciplined.
[03:18:39.828 --> 03:18:40.588]  He stayed focused.
[03:18:40.969 --> 03:18:47.374]  He kept bringing the points back to illegal immigration, to the economy, to the war overseas.
[03:18:48.215 --> 03:18:49.976]  With Biden, what you get is disaster.
[03:18:50.056 --> 03:18:50.717]  You get war.
[03:18:50.757 --> 03:18:51.517]  You get poverty.
[03:18:51.537 --> 03:18:52.578]  You get crime.
[03:18:52.598 --> 03:18:54.560]  You get immigration everywhere.
[03:18:54.620 --> 03:18:55.641]  And that impacts everybody.
[03:18:55.981 --> 03:18:58.403]  It impacts white jobs, black jobs, Hispanic jobs.
[03:18:58.443 --> 03:18:59.684]  It impacts Social Security.
[03:18:59.704 --> 03:19:01.005]  It impacts Medicare.
[03:19:01.205 --> 03:19:02.246]  It impacts Medicaid.
[03:19:02.286 --> 03:19:03.307]  It impacts health care.
[03:19:03.507 --> 03:19:04.528]  It impacts child care.
[03:19:04.828 --> 03:19:05.769]  It impacts housing.
[03:19:06.069 --> 03:19:11.771]  He's like, the vets are on the street homeless while illegal immigrants are being put up in luxury hotels in New York City.
[03:19:12.352 --> 03:19:20.095]  So and then, you know, I mean, that great point is you pointed out right at the time where the where Biden thought, you know, Social Security, Medicare be the big winners.
[03:19:20.135 --> 03:19:24.377]  They usually are for the Democrats because Republicans usually have dumb ideas about them.
[03:19:24.958 --> 03:19:28.339]  And Biden says, you know, I beat, beat Medicare.
[03:19:28.659 --> 03:19:29.920]  And he's like, yeah, you beat it to death.
[03:19:30.367 --> 03:19:31.767]  He looked younger than four years ago.
[03:19:31.586 --> 03:19:35.906]   really brilliantly handled by Trump. He was on his game. He was ready to take it apart.
[03:19:35.906 --> 03:19:38.947]  He looked younger than four years ago.
[03:19:38.947 --> 03:19:44.787]   Absolutely. I mean, whatever. I mean, he has high, high energy. It's right there. But you've
[03:19:44.787 --> 03:19:49.186]   seen it in person. You see it with his signature. If you're ever around.
[03:19:49.186 --> 03:19:52.305]  He's a warrior. He's a warrior. Yeah, completely.
[03:19:52.537 --> 03:20:00.028]  And he pointed out, you know, I thought it was good when he came back to the, he didn't take the bait on many of the distractions, the bogus scandals, the fake stories.
[03:20:00.148 --> 03:20:03.233]  Oh, I love how he ignored the questions, because the questions were where it was rigged.
[03:20:04.671 --> 03:20:05.112]  Absolutely.
[03:20:05.652 --> 03:20:06.613]  And at multiple levels.
[03:20:06.834 --> 03:20:12.761]  Because, I mean, that was sort of the goal and the objective of the debate was to recast 2020 and throw in the lawfare.
[03:20:13.141 --> 03:20:18.928]  And they thought we could do the bogus scandals for 2020 and Joe Biden will be... You know who Joe Biden is?
[03:20:19.228 --> 03:20:21.971]  Do you remember that Mumbles character from Dick Tracy?
[03:20:22.171 --> 03:20:22.292]  I do.
[03:20:23.412 --> 03:20:28.372]   The Warren Beatty movie, he is that guy. He's literally the Mumbles character. I think it was
[03:20:28.372 --> 03:20:34.612]   played by Dustin Hoffman. All that stuff, I mean, that's who he is for life. And even with all the
[03:20:34.612 --> 03:20:41.332]   drugs, even with a week of preparation, he could barely get through 90 minutes. So it just shows
[03:20:41.332 --> 03:20:45.572]   that whatever they thought was going to happen, didn't happen. That they didn't try to-
[03:20:45.572 --> 03:20:49.572]  Biden would just look down and you know. Oh, absolutely.
[03:20:49.853 --> 03:20:51.036]  I mean, it was just embarrassing.
[03:20:51.076 --> 03:20:57.452]  Although, I mean, even as you were pointing out, CNN, MSNBC, Twitter... Oh, they turned on him like a pack of sharks.
[03:20:58.680 --> 03:20:59.200]  Completely!
[03:20:59.660 --> 03:21:08.263]  Because I think they thought they would get a redo of 2020, where they're able to distract Trump at times, and Biden... I mean, you were the first person to point this out early 2020, remember?
[03:21:08.544 --> 03:21:16.386]  It was the original excuse to take you off Instagram, was you're saying something's going wrong with Joe Biden's mental health, his mental acuity.
[03:21:16.766 --> 03:21:18.187]  It's going to go on the decline.
[03:21:18.527 --> 03:21:21.748]  And they were so scared of that story that they banned you from Instagram.
[03:21:21.768 --> 03:21:26.370]  Well, clearly, because he was okay, and suddenly couldn't talk, I said he's had a stroke again.
[03:21:27.640 --> 03:21:28.101]  Exactly!
[03:21:28.301 --> 03:21:28.882]  And it's clear!
[03:21:29.022 --> 03:21:38.174]  I mean, everybody, I was asking people what drugs explain, like, the whole eyes thing, the no blinking thing, and the most common response was, this is early signs of Parkinson's.
[03:21:38.634 --> 03:21:42.920]  That that, you know, the, that this isn't, that no drug can compensate for.
[03:21:43.500 --> 03:21:53.124]  And so this was supposed to prove that he could get by in the debate, that they could trap Trump again, that he could survive and sustain, and that there would be a game changer.
[03:21:53.144 --> 03:21:54.745]  Because Trump doesn't need a game changer.
[03:21:54.785 --> 03:21:55.645]  He's up in the polls.
[03:21:55.705 --> 03:21:56.646]  He's winning everywhere.
[03:21:56.986 --> 03:21:58.466]  Biden needs the game changer.
[03:21:58.607 --> 03:21:59.587]  Biden is behind.
[03:22:00.271 --> 03:22:08.495]  And Trump agreed, you know, somewhat risky to these terms and conditions of the debate because his gamble paid off.
[03:22:09.115 --> 03:22:12.457]  His gamble was that Biden is not the same Biden of even four years ago.
[03:22:12.717 --> 03:22:13.857]  So let me ask you this.
[03:22:15.198 --> 03:22:17.639]  People that just tuned in, we played some of CNN.
[03:22:18.159 --> 03:22:20.120]  It was all bloodbath replaced Biden.
[03:22:20.140 --> 03:22:23.281]  They're now officially saying it, but Roger Stone said three years ago.
[03:22:23.321 --> 03:22:24.162]  What do you think comes next?
[03:22:25.543 --> 03:22:27.565]  Well, I mean, they have a practical problem.
[03:22:27.925 --> 03:22:36.071]  So they have a legal problem with removing him from, there's issues with the Ohio ballot, of him even having ballot access, of the Democratic Party having ballot access if they replace him.
[03:22:36.091 --> 03:22:37.732]  Because they were too lazy to even file it.
[03:22:38.733 --> 03:22:39.253]  That's correct.
[03:22:39.974 --> 03:22:43.356]  Then, in the other ballots, they gotta get that in by early August.
[03:22:43.977 --> 03:22:46.999]  And if they don't get it in by early August, it creates all these problems.
[03:22:47.119 --> 03:22:49.641]  Because they start printing the ballots in August.
[03:22:50.248 --> 03:22:56.032]  Uh, they've established all these, I think bogus deadlines for independent and third party candidates, but now they're kind of stuck with them.
[03:22:56.592 --> 03:22:58.614]  So they would have to move very, very fast.
[03:22:59.074 --> 03:22:59.794]  And how do you move?
[03:22:59.935 --> 03:23:05.818]  And you can't move Biden out without also moving Kamala Harris out because Kamala Harris is more unpopular than Biden.
[03:23:06.159 --> 03:23:09.681]  She's universally despised in DC and across America.
[03:23:10.161 --> 03:23:12.143]  So how do you get her out of the way?
[03:23:12.183 --> 03:23:18.407]  Black people, uh, she was got 1% with the general, 2% with general voters, 1% with blacks.
[03:23:18.447 --> 03:23:19.027]  Blacks hate her.
[03:23:19.087 --> 03:23:19.988]  She's not a black woman.
[03:23:21.323 --> 03:23:21.723]  Exactly.
[03:23:21.743 --> 03:23:25.547]  Then the next problem is Gavin Newsom is extremely unpopular in the Midwest.
[03:23:25.987 --> 03:23:28.830]  Working class, uh, you know, I mean, we know some of these people.
[03:23:29.110 --> 03:23:38.118]  The kind of people that are holding on to Biden are your older blue-collar Democrat from the Midwest that doesn't mind corrupt Uncle Joe because corrupt Uncle Joe helped Junior get a job.
[03:23:38.238 --> 03:23:39.459]  You know, that kind of, right?
[03:23:40.097 --> 03:23:42.538]  Gavin Newsom says blow-dried San Francisco.
[03:23:42.898 --> 03:23:46.299]  Says the guy, you know, probably bats both ways.
[03:23:46.699 --> 03:23:49.759]  You know, he's not somebody who plays well in blue-collar middle America.
[03:23:50.240 --> 03:23:51.580]  And so, he's not an option.
[03:23:52.240 --> 03:23:54.881]  And so, nor is Big Mike an option.
[03:23:55.221 --> 03:23:58.282]  Because she hates the American people more than anybody.
[03:23:58.682 --> 03:24:02.003]  So, you know who's going to want to usurp this opportunity?
[03:24:02.243 --> 03:24:09.985]   Wait to see if you don't start seeing leaks that the person who's willing to come to the rescue of the Democratic Party Is one Hillary Rodham.
[03:24:10.566 --> 03:24:11.066]  No, I agree.
[03:24:11.106 --> 03:24:12.607]  I've seen articles pushing her now.
[03:24:14.168 --> 03:24:16.169]  Yeah, and I think that's a substantial risk.
[03:24:17.050 --> 03:24:19.872]  I mean, I think that if you're Biden, that's what you're worried about.
[03:24:19.932 --> 03:24:21.753]  But how do they take Kamala Harris out?
[03:24:22.193 --> 03:24:23.174]  That's what I've always said.
[03:24:23.214 --> 03:24:28.998]  As I said, if you want to figure out how they replace Biden, figure out first how they replace Kamala Harris.
[03:24:29.238 --> 03:24:30.799]  But let's go back to that.
[03:24:30.879 --> 03:24:33.201]  But Biden is an Obama property.
[03:24:33.221 --> 03:24:34.481]  They don't like the Clems.
[03:24:34.501 --> 03:24:35.102]  How does that play?
[03:24:36.246 --> 03:24:38.047]  Yeah, that's another problem, right?
[03:24:38.087 --> 03:24:41.009]  There's so many internal divides.
[03:24:41.190 --> 03:24:48.174]  I mean, the Clintons effectively erased the Democratic bench, except for the Obama crew.
[03:24:48.595 --> 03:24:54.839]  And the Obama crew is a bunch of professional managerial class people from the coast who are utterly hated in middle America.
[03:24:55.360 --> 03:25:01.584]  Obama could get by because he was the first black president who was personally likable to most Americans.
[03:25:02.299 --> 03:25:04.302]  Uh, and his policies never were popular.
[03:25:04.682 --> 03:25:09.007]  He skated by because Americans really wanted the first black president to succeed.
[03:25:09.027 --> 03:25:11.390]  Yeah, we wanted to end racism instead he made it ten times worse.
[03:25:12.452 --> 03:25:13.532]  Exactly, exactly.
[03:25:13.612 --> 03:25:18.013]  And because of that experience, now they thought they could recreate that with Kamala Harris.
[03:25:18.293 --> 03:25:33.276]  You know, another person born of immigrants, another person biracial, another person not really raised in America, another person who's related, like Obama, to... I mean, what's unique about Obama and Kamala Harris, first black president, first black vice president, neither one of them have ancestors that were slaves.
[03:25:33.616 --> 03:25:35.437]  But they do have ancestors that were slave owners.
[03:25:35.877 --> 03:25:38.097]  I mean, that's what that tells you what the Democratic Party really is.
[03:25:38.177 --> 03:25:40.878]  And meanwhile, in the genealogy, Trump is the only president that didn't.
[03:25:41.983 --> 03:25:43.225]  That's exactly right.
[03:25:43.305 --> 03:25:44.206]  Trump and John Kennedy.
[03:25:44.506 --> 03:25:48.190]  They're also the only two presidents that were poorer while they were in the White House.
[03:25:50.112 --> 03:25:53.276]  And they impeached and indicted one and they assassinated the other.
[03:25:53.296 --> 03:25:57.281]  I think the concern we have to have is if the D.C.
[03:25:57.481 --> 03:26:02.887]  state gets into a dark mood, that there are bad events that could be forthcoming.
[03:26:03.027 --> 03:26:05.568]  I mean, there is a way to remove... Well, that's what I was about to say.
[03:26:05.628 --> 03:26:07.409]  We're all really positive right now.
[03:26:07.529 --> 03:26:11.471]  Like the wolf says in Pulp Fiction, let's start sucking each other's dicks right now.
[03:26:12.012 --> 03:26:13.392]  They're gonna pull something big.
[03:26:13.653 --> 03:26:16.034]  I mean, let's not get that sideways here.
[03:26:17.304 --> 03:26:22.246]  Yeah, to be honest with you, I would have preferred if their takeaway had been, oh, this was okay.
[03:26:22.586 --> 03:26:23.806]  Biden is still reasonable.
[03:26:23.886 --> 03:26:25.187]  Trump is still crazy.
[03:26:25.507 --> 03:26:30.648]  If that had been the CNN, MSNBC, New York Times, Twitter take tonight from the Twitter left.
[03:26:30.888 --> 03:26:35.590]  I mean, even like black Twitter was just saying it was just ragging on Biden the entire debate.
[03:26:36.332 --> 03:26:40.095]  Uh, so, I mean, I think they thought that they bought their own fake news stories.
[03:26:40.455 --> 03:26:47.400]  That, hey, all these examples of Biden having problems are made up, and they're fake videos, and it's like, no they're not!
[03:26:47.841 --> 03:26:51.003]  And so the, I think they bought into their own fake news stories about Trump.
[03:26:51.363 --> 03:26:55.106]  That, you know, Trump won't be able to control himself, that Trump will go off, that Trump will make a gap.
[03:26:55.126 --> 03:27:00.730]  And by the way, it's now in the New York Times, Sacramento Bee, you name it, they're openly saying replace Biden officially.
[03:27:01.892 --> 03:27:02.493]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:27:02.593 --> 03:27:13.924]  Roger Stone is completely, not just vindicated, he literally said this in January of 2021 when Biden was inaugurated.
[03:27:13.944 --> 03:27:16.366]  He said, watch, they'll replace him at the inauguration.
[03:27:16.426 --> 03:27:17.227]  It's happening now.
[03:27:17.267 --> 03:27:19.950]  And by the way, Roger Stone with Look What House is coming up.
[03:27:20.030 --> 03:27:20.630]  I mean, wow.
[03:27:20.971 --> 03:27:23.133]  Roger Stone gets an extra gold star for this.
[03:27:24.264 --> 03:27:26.485]  Well, their original plan was to use Kamala Harris.
[03:27:26.765 --> 03:27:31.108]  They just didn't realize she was as dumb as she is and would be as unpopular as she is.
[03:27:31.548 --> 03:27:35.711]  They thought she was like, you look at this, Justin Trudeau in Canada, Macron in France.
[03:27:36.311 --> 03:27:41.374]  I mean, you can get up the old videos of Macron dancing the way Zelensky danced at, you know, various places.
[03:27:41.394 --> 03:27:42.735]  I mean, these people are totally fake.
[03:27:43.335 --> 03:27:54.140]  And the belief was if we could have this manufactured candidate who fits the identity checklist, then we can recreate the Obama phenomenon the way we did with Macron, the way we did with Trudeau.
[03:27:54.420 --> 03:27:55.681]  We can do it with Kamala Harris.
[03:27:56.041 --> 03:28:00.783]  And the goal was, you know, within a year or two, push Uncle Joe out and bring Kamala in.
[03:28:01.263 --> 03:28:02.504]  But not only... But it worked.
[03:28:02.524 --> 03:28:04.405]  So in closing, we appreciate your time.
[03:28:04.445 --> 03:28:05.445]  Join me tomorrow if you will.
[03:28:07.046 --> 03:28:08.807]  Robert Barnes, what does the Deep State do now?
[03:28:10.376 --> 03:28:13.437]  That's what we should all be scared and concerned about.
[03:28:14.017 --> 03:28:24.920]  Is that if they recognize the disaster this was, that mumbling, bumbling Biden is the debacle that he was on live TV, what bad game plan will they come up with next?
[03:28:26.020 --> 03:28:26.601]  And what is that?
[03:28:29.021 --> 03:28:29.662]  I'm concerned.
[03:28:29.862 --> 03:28:31.502]  Well, they already said it.
[03:28:31.542 --> 03:28:33.243]  They said he's done, he's horrible.
[03:28:34.503 --> 03:28:37.524]  Unanimously on CNN, the panel said dump him.
[03:28:37.564 --> 03:28:38.124]  So what happens?
[03:28:39.646 --> 03:28:48.430]  Well, I mean, if you're in their planning room, you would want someone you could blame on Trump assassinating both Biden and Kamala Harris.
[03:28:48.890 --> 03:28:54.233]  I mean, that's what you would... So they assassinate Biden to turn defeat into victory?
[03:28:55.393 --> 03:28:56.634]  Yeah, I mean, exactly.
[03:28:57.134 --> 03:28:57.754]  Exactly.
[03:28:57.914 --> 03:29:00.955]  And you probably need to take Harris out at the same time.
[03:29:01.056 --> 03:29:02.976]  It solves your problem of Biden and Harris.
[03:29:03.917 --> 03:29:06.538]  It makes him a martyr, a sacrificial lamb.
[03:29:07.823 --> 03:29:16.195]  And it greenlights bringing somebody else in, but doing so not on the sign of weakness, but a rally around the country kind of effect.
[03:29:16.675 --> 03:29:19.379]  And you say, see how dangerous the Trump supporters are.
[03:29:19.519 --> 03:29:21.142]  See how dangerous Trump's speech is.
[03:29:22.170 --> 03:29:27.955]  They're already planning that in the gag order that they're seeking to trump in the Florida case.
[03:29:27.995 --> 03:29:32.279]  They're saying, look at how everybody gets secret signals from Trump to do violent acts.
[03:29:32.980 --> 03:29:38.244]  They prosecuted someone that supposedly made threats against the president related to that.
[03:29:38.604 --> 03:29:44.489]  So I would be concerned that they escalate in a very, very deep state kind of way.
[03:29:45.190 --> 03:29:46.731]  That would be my greatest concern.
[03:29:46.891 --> 03:29:47.612]  I hope they don't.
[03:29:48.132 --> 03:29:59.555]  I hope they say, well, we can survive this, that we can continue to use the lawfare against Trump like they, I mean, it's clear tonight, but the Biden's entire campaign plan is not Trump.
[03:29:59.795 --> 03:30:02.215]  And the whole basis of not Trump is the lawfare.
[03:30:02.655 --> 03:30:05.356]  Look at the criminal cases, look at the civil cases.
[03:30:05.436 --> 03:30:07.696]  But it's a day late, it's a day late, a dollar short.
[03:30:07.716 --> 03:30:09.457]  So Barnes, you're hard to get on.
[03:30:10.037 --> 03:30:11.538]  We're going to have a huge audience tomorrow.
[03:30:12.138 --> 03:30:16.720]  Tell the producers when you'll come on with 30 Minutes tomorrow, in the aftermath, to give your take 10.
[03:30:17.160 --> 03:30:17.920]  Promise you'll come on.
[03:30:18.140 --> 03:30:19.101]  Are you busy in court?
[03:30:19.141 --> 03:30:19.601]  Come on tomorrow.
[03:30:19.841 --> 03:30:20.001]  Yeah.
[03:30:20.741 --> 03:30:22.262]  Oh no, tomorrow, no court, nothing.
[03:30:22.302 --> 03:30:23.142]  I'm free all day tomorrow.
[03:30:23.183 --> 03:30:25.123]  So happy to be on whenever you need me.
[03:30:25.143 --> 03:30:25.844]  Join me tomorrow.
[03:30:26.084 --> 03:30:27.264]  How do people find your podcast?
[03:30:28.805 --> 03:30:31.266]  VivaBarnesLaw.Locals.com.
[03:30:31.826 --> 03:30:40.774]   But bottom line, 30 second closing comment, disaster, total rout, I mean, I mean, why would CNN?
[03:30:40.894 --> 03:30:43.395]  I mean, they were literally saying, we gotta get rid of Biden.
[03:30:43.435 --> 03:30:44.795]  This is historic.
[03:30:44.815 --> 03:30:45.776]  I don't even have words for it.
[03:30:47.136 --> 03:30:57.261]  Yeah, it's the biggest debate debacle I can remember since Michael Dukakis couldn't know whether he should use the death penalty if someone raped and murdered his wife, in terms of Joe Biden's disastrous performance.
[03:30:57.381 --> 03:31:04.604]  And Trump, one of the great debaters of all time, it was the best debate performance he's ever had of all the debates he's ever done.
[03:31:05.217 --> 03:31:11.102]  And the combination is great, as long as the deep state doesn't escalate in a dangerous and dark way in the coming days.
[03:31:11.423 --> 03:31:12.984]  Yeah, that's the real issue, folks.
[03:31:13.004 --> 03:31:19.370]  So, to quote the Wolf again, from Pulp Fiction, let's not start sucking each other's dicks yet.
[03:31:19.790 --> 03:31:20.951]  Alright, Robert Barnes, thank you.
[03:31:23.733 --> 03:31:23.954]  It's 10-39.
[03:31:26.312 --> 03:31:27.893]  Central Standard Time.
[03:31:28.553 --> 03:31:34.576]  Donald Trump just mopped the floor with the pedophile Muppet that is Joe Biden.
[03:31:34.876 --> 03:31:42.680]  And now, to cover the rest of the story is the great Roger Stone and Luke Hradowski.
[03:31:42.800 --> 03:31:44.961]  Gentlemen, so honored to have you.
[03:31:44.981 --> 03:31:46.042]  What an epic moment.
[03:31:46.362 --> 03:31:50.784]  We should talk about what we saw tonight, but also how the empire will strike back, gentlemen.
[03:31:52.646 --> 03:31:58.328]  Alex, this played out, as you pointed out, exactly as I said it would almost three years ago.
[03:31:59.269 --> 03:32:06.892]  There's a lot of people celebrating tonight, Barack Obama and his wife, Hillary Clinton, who's trying to figure out how to maneuver in here herself.
[03:32:07.652 --> 03:32:10.753]  This was the unmitigated disaster that I think it was set up to be.
[03:32:10.793 --> 03:32:14.094]  In other words, I think this was orchestrated from the beginning.
[03:32:14.955 --> 03:32:16.975]  That's why we have a debate so early.
[03:32:17.056 --> 03:32:23.565]   Why would Joe Biden a debate months before he's even going to be the official
[03:32:23.565 --> 03:32:28.854]   illegal nominee of the Democratic Party. And why would his handlers let this
[03:32:28.854 --> 03:32:33.745]   go forward knowing what a cataclysmic disaster it could be?
[03:32:33.745 --> 03:32:35.745]  And then we saw CNN like piranhas attack him immediately.
[03:32:35.745 --> 03:32:40.245]   CNN, Politico, the corporate media right now is reading from the same script.
[03:32:40.587 --> 03:32:41.828]  Biden is done.
[03:32:41.848 --> 03:32:43.489]  The puppet has been ditched.
[03:32:43.849 --> 03:32:47.031]  This is a controlled demolition of the Biden administration.
[03:32:47.371 --> 03:32:50.093]  And we're seeing it unfold right in front of our eyes.
[03:32:50.153 --> 03:32:51.974]  And Roger has been saying this.
[03:32:52.194 --> 03:32:53.715]  He said this on our show a couple months ago.
[03:32:53.795 --> 03:32:56.937]  He said this many, many months ago, even before then.
[03:32:57.257 --> 03:32:58.098]  He has called it.
[03:32:58.138 --> 03:33:02.298]   We just finished an incredible four hour live broadcast going through this entire debate.
[03:33:02.298 --> 03:33:06.057]   And we're kind of scratching our heads, but we thought about the same thing cuz Roger
[03:33:06.057 --> 03:33:07.057]  brought it up.
[03:33:07.057 --> 03:33:08.538]  Roger was calling it from the very beginning.
[03:33:08.538 --> 03:33:12.817]   There was significant pressures that they were testing the waters with against Joe Biden.
[03:33:12.817 --> 03:33:15.017]  They were kind of attacking him, not really attacking him.
[03:33:15.017 --> 03:33:16.497]  They put pressure on Hunter.
[03:33:16.497 --> 03:33:18.778]  But now I think the end game is clear.
[03:33:18.778 --> 03:33:19.778]  He is out.
[03:33:19.778 --> 03:33:21.378]  He's not going to be the nominee.
[03:33:21.378 --> 03:33:25.977]   There's going to be a lot of surprises this upcoming election cycle.
[03:33:25.977 --> 03:33:28.298]  up. People better strap in because it's going to get wild.
[03:33:28.362 --> 03:33:29.103]  It's going to get crazy.
[03:33:29.143 --> 03:33:32.405]  And Roger Stone here predicted it from the very beginning.
[03:33:32.706 --> 03:33:37.109]  And his analysis, especially when it comes to Obama's involvement here, is key.
[03:33:37.449 --> 03:33:39.411]  Michelle Obama, she's calling.
[03:33:39.871 --> 03:33:43.074]  And there's people who's going to be picking up that phone right now.
[03:33:43.194 --> 03:33:44.935]  And she's going to be calling the shots here.
[03:33:45.356 --> 03:33:46.536]  You definitely called it, Roger.
[03:33:46.556 --> 03:33:49.118]  I want to go into the bad news of their counterstrike, bud.
[03:33:50.359 --> 03:33:54.683]  Trump did a great job, though, regardless of this being Trump's performance.
[03:33:55.857 --> 03:33:58.149]  Extraordinarily disciplined, never took the bait.
[03:33:58.940 --> 03:34:01.682]  Never, not even once did he seem to lose his temper.
[03:34:02.643 --> 03:34:04.925]  He had Joe, I think, on the ropes.
[03:34:05.766 --> 03:34:09.509]  Joe just, I mean, the guy's ability to lie is really amazing.
[03:34:09.569 --> 03:34:12.651]  I mean, the Charlottesville lie, recycled.
[03:34:12.731 --> 03:34:16.495]  The loser, losers and suckers lie, recycled.
[03:34:17.716 --> 03:34:18.716]  He can't help himself.
[03:34:19.777 --> 03:34:24.001]  And it looks to me like if this guy did preparation, he appeared to me like he'd done no preparation.
[03:34:24.361 --> 03:34:26.763]  Then they try to put out the word, oh, well, Joe had a cold.
[03:34:27.584 --> 03:34:30.677]  There was something, some weird quality in his voice.
[03:34:30.737 --> 03:34:32.444]  I thought that was kind of strange, but.
[03:34:33.710 --> 03:34:38.513]  No, there's no question about this, that as Luke said, the talking points have gone out.
[03:34:38.593 --> 03:34:44.796]  They went out immediately, and all the corporate media monkeys just jump on the talking points.
[03:34:45.257 --> 03:34:47.538]  What was the switch in CNN's headline?
[03:34:47.578 --> 03:34:51.480]  It went from- Aggressive sources say damage control.
[03:34:51.940 --> 03:34:53.321]  We're freaking out, we're losing.
[03:34:53.661 --> 03:35:01.346]   And this is, again, a major realization, and as you mentioned, Biden lied from the very Well, here's the most immediate danger, and I think we can see this.
[03:35:01.206 --> 03:35:04.865]   inject bleach into their veins. That never happened. Trump was very smart. He
[03:35:04.865 --> 03:35:08.226]   never fell for a lot of the traps, for a lot of the insults that Biden...
[03:35:08.226 --> 03:35:13.625]   Sure, so here's the issue. Conservatives can't get too excited about this win because now the next
[03:35:13.625 --> 03:35:14.665]  phase is beginning.
[03:35:14.665 --> 03:35:19.385]   Well, and that, here's the most immediate danger, and I think we can see this.
[03:35:19.385 --> 03:35:25.585]  On July 11th, they're going to put Donald Trump in jail.
[03:35:23.931 --> 03:35:25.171]  They're going to put him in jail.
[03:35:25.532 --> 03:35:33.397]  People say to me, lawyers particularly, oh well, given the non-violent nature of his offense, given the fact that he's a one time... No, forget all of that.
[03:35:33.718 --> 03:35:35.459]  There are different rules for Donald Trump.
[03:35:35.899 --> 03:35:42.504]  They're going to incarcerate him, which I think actually is once again overplaying their hand enormously.
[03:35:42.784 --> 03:35:52.171]   It will backfire But they are so demented, they're so deranged, they are so driven insane by Donald Trump that they're going to do it.
[03:35:52.251 --> 03:35:55.914]  And I think it will backfire, and I think it will move a step further.
[03:35:55.934 --> 03:36:04.901]  Yeah, not to bring myself into this, but in federal court this morning, the Democrat party representing the San Diego people said, we don't want money, we want him shut down now.
[03:36:04.961 --> 03:36:06.122]  The judge said no again.
[03:36:06.823 --> 03:36:08.104]  Jones is trying to give you money.
[03:36:08.764 --> 03:36:10.926]  They don't, it's deranged.
[03:36:12.168 --> 03:36:12.949]  Yeah, they don't want money.
[03:36:12.969 --> 03:36:13.969]  They want to silence us.
[03:36:14.270 --> 03:36:15.370]  And that's what they did.
[03:36:15.391 --> 03:36:16.391]  They silenced Rumble.
[03:36:16.431 --> 03:36:22.796]  They shut down Rumble right before everyone was going to that particular platform to watch these particular debates.
[03:36:23.156 --> 03:36:26.479]  They made sure that the comments were turned off at the CNN live.
[03:36:26.659 --> 03:36:27.380]  Okay, I missed that.
[03:36:27.400 --> 03:36:28.521]  So they shut down Rumble?
[03:36:28.541 --> 03:36:30.722]  Because Elon Musk said he wouldn't let it shut down.
[03:36:31.102 --> 03:36:31.803]  They shut down Rumble?
[03:36:31.843 --> 03:36:32.343]  I didn't know that.
[03:36:33.204 --> 03:36:33.725]  Yeah, no, no.
[03:36:33.765 --> 03:36:35.106]  Rumble was down.
[03:36:35.126 --> 03:36:36.607]  We were about to make the transition.
[03:36:36.647 --> 03:36:38.868]  The debate started and then we were looking at our Rumble numbers.
[03:36:38.888 --> 03:36:39.669]  Oh yeah, that's what Steven said.
[03:36:39.689 --> 03:36:40.750]  Rumble went down tonight.
[03:36:41.641 --> 03:36:44.985]  Yeah, exactly, which was a major attack against free speech.
[03:36:45.025 --> 03:36:46.747]  There was major individuals on there.
[03:36:46.787 --> 03:36:47.488]  We were on there.
[03:36:47.548 --> 03:36:49.571]  Tim Poole did his first broadcast on there.
[03:36:49.611 --> 03:36:50.772]  Steven Crowder was on there.
[03:36:50.792 --> 03:36:53.816]  As soon as it went back up, they started to get significant numbers.
[03:36:53.856 --> 03:36:57.821]  But, of course, they're not the same numbers as if they were able to be there from the very beginning.
[03:36:58.041 --> 03:37:00.984]  So there's a full-on attack against free speech.
[03:37:01.204 --> 03:37:16.918]  There's a full-on attack against the counter-narratives here because they have their script, they have their roles that they're playing right now, and they're very terrified about people questioning it and seeing the next step ahead of this, which is going to be more crazy, tumultuous actions moving forward.
[03:37:17.358 --> 03:37:21.722]  And I agree with Roger, they're kind of acting like a scared animal in a corner.
[03:37:21.921 --> 03:37:27.421]   Those animals freak out. They're panicking. That's what they want us to kind of perceive here.
[03:37:27.421 --> 03:37:33.381]   And I do think the next big upcoming political thing that is going to be happening is going to be the sentencing of
[03:37:33.381 --> 03:37:35.721]  Donald Trump in just a few days from now.
[03:37:35.721 --> 03:37:38.521]   Where I think they're going to take the gloves off because they're in full on panic.
[03:37:38.521 --> 03:37:40.521]  And they said they're going to put him in Rikers. I agree.
[03:37:40.345 --> 03:37:44.188]  But look at that.
[03:37:45.228 --> 03:37:46.970]  813,000, 814,000 live viewers.
[03:37:47.390 --> 03:37:53.515]  We have millions on our own channel, all just on X. So people want to put down, you know, Musk.
[03:37:53.936 --> 03:37:55.217]  It didn't go down like Rumble.
[03:37:55.257 --> 03:37:55.957]  We love Rumble.
[03:37:56.257 --> 03:37:57.899]  But look at that.
[03:37:57.919 --> 03:38:00.881]  814,000 viewers right now, Roger.
[03:38:01.442 --> 03:38:02.883]  Right now, Luke Grodowski.
[03:38:03.243 --> 03:38:04.964]  They are, what do you think of Musk?
[03:38:05.105 --> 03:38:06.586]  That is big right there.
[03:38:07.441 --> 03:38:08.282]  No, this is incredible.
[03:38:08.322 --> 03:38:12.545]  This is one of the few things standing in the way of this kind of controlled narrative.
[03:38:12.585 --> 03:38:16.888]  This is one of the reasons why they have to do so many of these tricks, why they have to be so underhanded.
[03:38:17.249 --> 03:38:21.972]  They are terrified of people just being able to speak to each other, and we have that.
[03:38:21.992 --> 03:38:26.376]  And Mustand, when CNN told him two days ago, you can't carry this, he goes, it's fair use.
[03:38:26.716 --> 03:38:35.743]  I mean, look, we have four feeds going, all combined, two million viewers right now watching, separate from everything, just on X. I mean, that is huge.
[03:38:35.782 --> 03:38:37.823]  CNN was threatening to sue independent media.
[03:38:37.823 --> 03:38:41.501]   They were sending out legal letters to all the heads of independent media saying we're
[03:38:41.501 --> 03:38:43.302]  going to take you guys down.
[03:38:43.302 --> 03:38:44.301]  We tested the waters.
[03:38:44.301 --> 03:38:46.541]  I was on Glenn Beck show three days ago.
[03:38:46.541 --> 03:38:47.541]  He just got the letter.
[03:38:47.541 --> 03:38:51.262]  They said we'll sue you if you even play a clip.
[03:38:51.262 --> 03:38:54.382]  Yeah, it's not working.
[03:38:54.401 --> 03:38:56.523]  The whole censorship thing is not working.
[03:38:56.563 --> 03:38:58.925]  But it does not mean that they won't ratchet it down.
[03:38:58.985 --> 03:39:02.188]  By the way, if you look at your numbers at X Jones, they're going down.
[03:39:02.349 --> 03:39:03.810]  Everybody's numbers are going down.
[03:39:04.611 --> 03:39:07.113]  So the algorithms are starting to kick in.
[03:39:07.133 --> 03:39:09.175]  No, Roger, you're right.
[03:39:10.856 --> 03:39:13.657]  They're flagging us, but today it's not working.
[03:39:13.917 --> 03:39:14.317]  Put it up!
[03:39:15.338 --> 03:39:21.260]  Listen, Roger, 814,000 people are watching you right now on Exelon.
[03:39:21.800 --> 03:39:24.221]  So, yeah, I get they're dialing it down, but it ain't working.
[03:39:24.241 --> 03:39:24.881]  What do you say to that?
[03:39:25.622 --> 03:39:27.162]  What do you say?
[03:39:27.422 --> 03:39:33.284]  We got five feeds up, two million viewers, one feed, 818,000 right now.
[03:39:33.364 --> 03:39:34.065]  What do you say to them?
[03:39:34.985 --> 03:39:37.686]  What I say to them is go to StoneZone.com right now.
[03:39:38.579 --> 03:39:54.262]  No, that's beautiful, they should do it, but I mean... And we are Change.org, StoneZone.com... No, but you're right, we're seeing a major dial-back on conservatives on X, but I talk to insiders, they have an army of bots, false flagging, and doing reports to suppress those numbers.
[03:39:55.629 --> 03:40:08.476]  Yeah, there's something definitely going on because this assault on me last week because I had the audacity to call for every legal and technical tool by the Republicans to ensure an honest election.
[03:40:08.836 --> 03:40:09.777]  That's what I actually said.
[03:40:10.157 --> 03:40:13.498]  The number of bots pumping that out on X really blew my mind.
[03:40:13.819 --> 03:40:20.002]  Oh yeah, saying that you said you'll steal the election and in the audio you say, if they try to steal it, we're going to block it.
[03:40:20.905 --> 03:40:25.307]  Yeah, it's crazy, but it's part of the same strategy, as you know.
[03:40:25.668 --> 03:40:29.109]  The same reason they're going after you, the same reason they're going after me.
[03:40:29.690 --> 03:40:31.591]  They thought they would take Tucker Carlson down.
[03:40:31.631 --> 03:40:32.771]  That didn't work out so well.
[03:40:33.072 --> 03:40:36.273]  They made him five times, ten times stronger than he was before.
[03:40:36.613 --> 03:40:37.954]  Because people want the truth.
[03:40:38.194 --> 03:40:39.395]  They have a hunger for the truth.
[03:40:39.615 --> 03:40:42.216]  They will find the truth if the truth is out there.
[03:40:42.276 --> 03:40:42.617]  Now it's 821,000.
[03:40:42.657 --> 03:40:43.937]  So let's talk about this right now.
[03:40:47.199 --> 03:40:48.220]  What is Trump gonna do?
[03:40:48.260 --> 03:40:49.060]  You're his confidant.
[03:40:49.080 --> 03:40:49.821]  You never brag about it.
[03:40:49.841 --> 03:40:50.661]  You don't kiss and tell.
[03:40:51.102 --> 03:40:53.583]  But they are in full panic mode with 130 days left.
[03:40:53.923 --> 03:40:54.684]  What's gonna happen next?
[03:40:54.744 --> 03:40:55.784]  Roger Stone, look, we're gonna ask you.
[03:40:58.026 --> 03:41:02.469]  Well, clearly the next big event is this sentencing.
[03:41:03.229 --> 03:41:05.150]  I think they're gonna overplay their hands.
[03:41:05.210 --> 03:41:16.137]  So if they send him to Rikers Island, which I think would be an enormous mistake, that really will, I think, hamper his ability to even appear virally at the convention to accept the nomination.
[03:41:16.770 --> 03:41:28.638]  If they lock him up in Trump Tower and say they put an ankle bracelet on him, the campaign will be out selling Donald Trump 2024 ankle bracelets within 48 hours and they will sell out of them.
[03:41:28.978 --> 03:41:32.760]  I mean, this is a political realignment that is coming.
[03:41:33.601 --> 03:41:36.322]  My greater concern is the A-word.
[03:41:36.583 --> 03:41:40.025]  Tucker Carlson, probably the first major figure in the country.
[03:41:40.385 --> 03:41:44.968]  Look, one of the earliest things I did in politics was to write a book on the assassination of John F. Kennedy.
[03:41:45.448 --> 03:41:49.909]  If they killed Kennedy, and they did, there's no question about that when I say they.
[03:41:49.929 --> 03:41:51.849]  Yeah, but we're not 1963.
[03:41:51.909 --> 03:41:53.050]  This ain't gonna fly.
[03:41:54.270 --> 03:41:55.830]  Well, it doesn't mean they won't try, though.
[03:41:56.590 --> 03:41:58.371]  Do you agree that they're crazy enough to try?
[03:41:58.411 --> 03:41:59.371]  No, no, I agree with you.
[03:41:59.411 --> 03:42:01.391]  I'm just saying we ain't 1963.
[03:42:02.972 --> 03:42:14.734]  No, but I guess what I'm saying here is they understand, and it's not about revenge, but when people were involved in treasonous activity, for example, John Brennan is shitting his pants right now.
[03:42:15.402 --> 03:42:18.223]  I mean, he is worse than Joe Biden.
[03:42:18.343 --> 03:42:20.324]  I'm going to start over.
[03:42:20.344 --> 03:42:21.225]  I want you on the floor.
[03:42:21.805 --> 03:42:23.085]  This is bigger than Trump.
[03:42:23.385 --> 03:42:25.867]  Don't they get, no matter what they do with Trump, we're awake now?
[03:42:25.887 --> 03:42:30.869]  There's no putting the genie back in the bottle, or as you like to say, toothpaste back in the tube.
[03:42:30.969 --> 03:42:38.252]  They don't understand that, because they don't understand, they think this populist, this nationalist revolution is all about one man.
[03:42:38.312 --> 03:42:39.432]  It's not about one man.
[03:42:39.933 --> 03:42:41.153]  I mean, one man is leading it.
[03:42:41.233 --> 03:42:41.953]  He's a focal point.
[03:42:44.102 --> 03:42:52.846]  Yeah, and he made it possible without any question, without his name identification, without his courage, without his bravado, this never would have happened.
[03:42:53.127 --> 03:42:56.388]  But the movement will go on past him at some point.
[03:42:56.508 --> 03:42:57.469]  They do not understand.
[03:42:57.509 --> 03:42:59.610]  Even bigger if they put him in jail or kill him.
[03:43:00.618 --> 03:43:04.519]  Well, but that's why they waited until the fourth year of Biden's presidency.
[03:43:04.779 --> 03:43:11.181]  You see, they thought that their stooge, Ron DeSantis, or their stooge, Nikki Haley, would beat him for the nomination.
[03:43:11.201 --> 03:43:16.262]  Then everything would go back to the way it was when we had the Bush-Clinton, you know, divide.
[03:43:16.702 --> 03:43:18.142]  Heads I win, tails you lose.
[03:43:18.982 --> 03:43:21.163]  It's never going to go back that way again, ever.
[03:43:21.323 --> 03:43:22.383]  They don't understand that.
[03:43:22.423 --> 03:43:23.103]  That's right.
[03:43:23.143 --> 03:43:24.324]  Their system's over.
[03:43:24.464 --> 03:43:25.564]  So what comes next?
[03:43:26.505 --> 03:43:31.349]  I still think they're going to be very desperate to try to take control of the narrative of the conversation.
[03:43:31.429 --> 03:43:37.733]  And they could do that through, I think, deliberate attempts to try to provoke people to be angry, to be violent.
[03:43:37.793 --> 03:43:39.014]  I think they're going to keep pushing.
[03:43:39.054 --> 03:43:40.775]  I think they're going to keep pressuring.
[03:43:41.116 --> 03:43:45.999]  And they're going to try to get the American people to overreact or to act violently.
[03:43:46.680 --> 03:43:51.143]  I think there's larger possibilities of things like Operation Gladio kind of playing up.
[03:43:51.583 --> 03:44:03.589]  As well as this administration, the Biden administration, ratcheting up tensions all over the world, especially when it comes to a lot of these foreign conflicts that are unfolding in Ukraine, potentially soon also in Lebanon.
[03:44:03.609 --> 03:44:09.532]  We just got very troubling news from the US State Department that's trying to get American citizens out of Lebanon just a couple hours ago.
[03:44:09.932 --> 03:44:11.152]  That's right, Luke, you're right.
[03:44:11.172 --> 03:44:15.654]  The answer, when Terrence are in trouble, as Gero Salente says, they take you to war.
[03:44:15.694 --> 03:44:16.414]  Let's speak to that.
[03:44:16.794 --> 03:44:23.697]  So instead of, as the Wolf said, I said this five times, we can't start celebrating yet because the enemy's going to come down with both feet.
[03:44:23.717 --> 03:44:27.618]  Luke Rodowski, Roger Stone, what does the Deep State do now?
[03:44:29.483 --> 03:44:32.346]  Assassination or World War, probably in the other order.
[03:44:32.566 --> 03:44:40.472]  So they have the demented idea that if we go to war, that perhaps the in party, that they will rally around Biden.
[03:44:40.532 --> 03:44:41.513]  I think Biden's cooked.
[03:44:42.374 --> 03:44:46.918]  I think now what happens backstage here is Barack Obama goes to him.
[03:44:47.338 --> 03:44:50.541]  He has a letter co-signed by a majority of the cabinet members.
[03:44:50.901 --> 03:44:52.682]  He's got Kamala Harris.
[03:44:52.783 --> 03:44:53.643]  25th Amendment.
[03:44:53.723 --> 03:45:03.928]   Yeah, and they say, Joe, We're going to take you out right now, in which case you will lose your ability to pardon your son, your brother, other members of the Biden crime family.
[03:45:04.188 --> 03:45:07.851]  Or you can go quietly and just announce that you're not running for re-election.
[03:45:08.211 --> 03:45:10.473]  We'll let you stay there through the end of your term.
[03:45:10.753 --> 03:45:14.676]  We'll make sure your son doesn't go to prison and they'll replace him.
[03:45:15.116 --> 03:45:17.238]  Then he releases his delegates.
[03:45:17.979 --> 03:45:23.163]  We have a runaway Democratic National Convention, which nominates Michelle Obama.
[03:45:23.223 --> 03:45:25.985]  Yes, I've been saying it for three plus years.
[03:45:26.647 --> 03:45:27.731]  Let's elaborate on that.
[03:45:27.832 --> 03:45:29.640]  You have been calling that and now it's happening.
[03:45:31.495 --> 03:45:33.416]  Look, it's kind of obvious.
[03:45:33.557 --> 03:45:34.797]  She carries no baggage.
[03:45:35.458 --> 03:45:38.540]  She's the most popular Democrat in the country who's eligible.
[03:45:38.900 --> 03:45:44.303]  Her husband cannot run again because he served two terms, although this would technically be his fourth term.
[03:45:44.643 --> 03:45:46.365]  They can put together the money quickly.
[03:45:46.445 --> 03:45:54.430]  They can certainly galvanize the majority of the cabinet members in order to enact the 25th Amendment, which is what it requires.
[03:45:55.050 --> 03:46:02.254]   And if that doesn't work, then yes, I pray every single day For the physical safety of Donald Trump and his family.
[03:46:02.414 --> 03:46:04.195]  Well, we were just talking about this before.
[03:46:04.275 --> 03:46:12.079]  There was a very interesting article by Axios just released today, specifically talking about how Michelle Obama really isn't happy with Joe Biden.
[03:46:12.439 --> 03:46:21.724]  So that is, again, planting the seeds, planting these larger stories that, of course, haven't in people's minds as they've been kind of suggesting this for a while.
[03:46:21.784 --> 03:46:24.325]  And again, they've been testing the waters, the corporate media.
[03:46:25.225 --> 03:46:27.106]  They're not any kind of news organizations.
[03:46:27.146 --> 03:46:34.069]  They're a vessel for the intelligentsia, for the deep state, for the sociopathic pedophiles out there that truly do call the shots.
[03:46:34.329 --> 03:46:41.433]  They are their PR management firm, and they're the ones implanting a lot of these ideas, and I think I agree with Roger.
[03:46:41.573 --> 03:46:44.754]  A lot of people right now are talking about Newsom potentially replacing him.
[03:46:45.014 --> 03:46:46.375]  He's at the debates right now.
[03:46:46.435 --> 03:46:47.855]  He's talking to a lot of the media.
[03:46:47.895 --> 03:46:50.637]  He's talking about potentially even stepping up if he needs to.
[03:46:51.237 --> 03:46:54.381]  But clearly there is going to be a major shift here.
[03:46:54.862 --> 03:46:58.386]  And I think Joe Biden was trying to hold on as much as he could.
[03:46:58.446 --> 03:47:03.873]  And I think it's not a coincidence that this debate is as late as it is in the political cycle as it is now.
[03:47:04.294 --> 03:47:06.757]  Usually they're kind of right before the elections.
[03:47:07.077 --> 03:47:09.318]  This one's 130 days out.
[03:47:09.598 --> 03:47:11.339]  That's not a coincidence there, in my opinion.
[03:47:11.639 --> 03:47:24.483]  And I think this, along with the coordinated kind of CNN-controlled demolition of the Biden administration, highlights this shift, which is pretty clear, pretty apparent, and it's going to be playing in the kind of playbook where they want it to go.
[03:47:24.503 --> 03:47:28.807]   The other thing, Alex, is kind of obvious, and that is, Keep an eye on Hilda Beast.
[03:47:29.168 --> 03:47:30.351]  She's gonna make her move now.
[03:47:30.772 --> 03:47:31.774]  She has a new book out.
[03:47:32.195 --> 03:47:33.818]  Great picture of her on the cover.
[03:47:33.838 --> 03:47:34.941]  Yeah, so wait a minute.
[03:47:35.001 --> 03:47:37.226]  You're saying it's Big Mike, but people are saying Hillary.
[03:47:38.004 --> 03:47:43.247]  Well, because I think Hillary says she maneuvers her way into the vice presidency.
[03:47:43.467 --> 03:47:45.629]  You see, she replaces Kamala.
[03:47:45.689 --> 03:47:50.472]  So if they take Michelle as the nominee, can't have two women of color on the ticket.
[03:47:50.812 --> 03:47:52.973]  So they have to have somebody who's white.
[03:47:53.493 --> 03:48:00.157]  That would be Gavin Newsom, but Hillary Clinton, who's still smarting over the beating that she took from Donald Trump.
[03:48:00.177 --> 03:48:00.418]  So I get it.
[03:48:00.438 --> 03:48:04.220]  You're saying it's going to be Big Mike with Hillary.
[03:48:05.129 --> 03:48:05.349]  Right.
[03:48:05.829 --> 03:48:08.670]  And then, who knows, does she get Arkansas-ed?
[03:48:08.730 --> 03:48:10.231]  I mean, I think it's entirely possible.
[03:48:10.331 --> 03:48:15.373]  And the Wall Street Journal... I don't care who you are, no one person knows 56 people who committed suicide.
[03:48:15.573 --> 03:48:16.393]  No one person.
[03:48:16.433 --> 03:48:16.853]  Absolutely.
[03:48:16.913 --> 03:48:25.236]  And then the Wall Street Journal had a very interesting article in an op-ed piece suggesting that Biden should replace Kamala with Hillary Clinton.
[03:48:25.256 --> 03:48:25.716]  There you go.
[03:48:25.796 --> 03:48:30.858]  They openly wrote about this stuff as, of course... Oh yeah, they're openly saying it.
[03:48:32.199 --> 03:48:38.808]  So do you think the Democrats on CNN calling for the end of Biden even were given the script before or given it right when he lost the debate?
[03:48:40.650 --> 03:48:42.813]  My guess is that it was a contingent move.
[03:48:42.853 --> 03:48:46.819]  In other words, it was kind of, if Joe is as bad as we think he's going to be, jump on this.
[03:48:47.552 --> 03:48:51.578]  Uh, and, uh, I suspects that he, that he, uh, that he performed below their expectations.
[03:48:51.598 --> 03:48:53.161]  Yeah, because we know they're totally bottom fed for it.
[03:48:53.181 --> 03:48:53.882]  They do what they're told.
[03:48:54.182 --> 03:49:01.654]  They literally, like, piranhas or flies on shit, attacked within seconds, like, viciously.
[03:49:02.967 --> 03:49:08.129]  Well, because they understand that if Trump gets back into power, it's not about revenge.
[03:49:08.609 --> 03:49:12.450]  But there was a treasonous coup that was attempted in this country.
[03:49:13.450 --> 03:49:14.071]  They failed.
[03:49:14.391 --> 03:49:16.251]  But those people are going to have to face justice.
[03:49:16.291 --> 03:49:20.553]  And that's why they've been out there with this whole revenge.
[03:49:20.693 --> 03:49:21.933]  Are you going to take revenge?
[03:49:22.513 --> 03:49:24.734]  No, what we're going to have is equal protection of the law.
[03:49:24.754 --> 03:49:26.175]  Well, we've got to remove the coup.
[03:49:26.195 --> 03:49:27.115]  We've got to remove the coup.
[03:49:28.340 --> 03:49:37.725]  Yes, but those who staged the coup, John Brennan, James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Barack Obama.
[03:49:37.765 --> 03:49:43.429]  Remember, this plot was born in the Oval Office under Barack Obama.
[03:49:43.449 --> 03:49:50.933]  It's kind of funny that when the judge in Florida does an honest job, she's attacked because she was a Trump appointee.
[03:49:50.973 --> 03:50:05.818]   Well, I went before a judge, General Flynn went before a judge, Paul Manafort went before a judge, George Papadopoulos went before a judge, Carter Page went before a judge, all a judge appointed by Barack Obama, but the left had no problem with that whatsoever.
[03:50:05.878 --> 03:50:06.438]  It's interesting.
[03:50:06.919 --> 03:50:07.459]  Great point.
[03:50:07.499 --> 03:50:15.647]  Closing comments from Roger Stone and Luke Hradowski before Owen Schroyer and Chase Geyser take over.
[03:50:15.667 --> 03:50:18.690]  We have a huge audience, millions extra.
[03:50:18.730 --> 03:50:19.311]  Tune in right now.
[03:50:21.098 --> 03:50:23.140]  This was a historic night.
[03:50:23.720 --> 03:50:25.401]  Again, people shouldn't be celebrating.
[03:50:25.461 --> 03:50:32.286]  People should be absolutely concerned, especially when the corporate media keeps regurgitating the same talking points all at once, all at the same time.
[03:50:32.687 --> 03:50:33.768]  Something is afoot here.
[03:50:33.908 --> 03:50:34.628]  Something is up.
[03:50:34.868 --> 03:50:35.529]  Be prepared.
[03:50:35.629 --> 03:50:38.111]  Strap in because it's going to be a wild ride.
[03:50:38.391 --> 03:50:39.332]  We had an incredible show.
[03:50:39.352 --> 03:50:42.154]  We literally watched the entire presidential debates.
[03:50:42.214 --> 03:50:44.255]  Roger Stone was giving us his commentary during it.
[03:50:44.596 --> 03:50:48.138]  Check it out right now on rumble.com forward slash we are change.
[03:50:48.198 --> 03:50:50.280]  We are change.org is the website.
[03:50:50.900 --> 03:50:54.484]  And, of course, we do live streams and podcasts now.
[03:50:54.524 --> 03:50:55.845]  We got another show 4 p.m.
[03:50:55.985 --> 03:50:56.946]  Eastern tomorrow.
[03:50:56.966 --> 03:51:00.008]  Tune in for that on Rumble.com forward slash WeAreChanged.
[03:51:00.069 --> 03:51:01.230]  Roger, again, pleasure.
[03:51:01.250 --> 03:51:05.033]  I'm very lucky to have you here in studio.
[03:51:05.133 --> 03:51:06.895]  And again, prophetic stuff.
[03:51:07.035 --> 03:51:07.996]  You've called it.
[03:51:08.336 --> 03:51:08.896]  It's happening.
[03:51:09.597 --> 03:51:13.120]  And you truly have your pulse on what's really happening here in America.
[03:51:13.220 --> 03:51:15.042]  And it's shocking how much you do.
[03:51:15.582 --> 03:51:16.463]  Alex, let me thank you.
[03:51:17.084 --> 03:51:18.705]  Alex, let me thank you for having us on.
[03:51:18.745 --> 03:51:22.148]  Give us an opportunity to take a little victory lap at least.
[03:51:22.768 --> 03:51:23.729]  But you're absolutely right.
[03:51:23.849 --> 03:51:28.413]  Now, like a cornered animal, the deep state is more dangerous than it has ever been.
[03:51:28.433 --> 03:51:34.258]  And we will not let Donald Trump ascend to the presidency peacefully.
[03:51:34.878 --> 03:51:36.600]  They are the ones who will use violence.
[03:51:36.963 --> 03:51:39.305]  They are the ones who are capable of a false flag.
[03:51:39.665 --> 03:51:41.787]  They are the ones who will violate the Constitution.
[03:51:42.168 --> 03:51:44.490]  They are the ones who are a danger to democracy.
[03:51:44.770 --> 03:51:45.891]  These are very dangerous times.
[03:51:45.911 --> 03:51:46.251]  Well, that's right.
[03:51:46.271 --> 03:51:47.372]  And in closing, I'll say this.
[03:51:47.913 --> 03:51:48.834]  We're all very humble.
[03:51:49.514 --> 03:51:50.515]  I'm on a power trip.
[03:51:50.795 --> 03:51:51.816]  I'm very blessed to be here.
[03:51:52.597 --> 03:52:02.301]   We probably have, no exaggeration, regular show, four or five million a day, at night, On a Thursday at 11 p.m.
[03:52:02.381 --> 03:52:08.504]  Central, we have millions on InfoWars, millions on X, millions everywhere of new listeners.
[03:52:08.985 --> 03:52:12.847]  The corporate media doesn't even have that, so we have to realize they're done.
[03:52:13.327 --> 03:52:25.094]   And so the good news is, humanity has awakened, and if all these viewers and listeners just take this show, watch this archive at Real Alex Jones, Or they just take it once it's a banned video or infowarriors.com, where it's on the show.
[03:52:25.414 --> 03:52:27.916]  Or they go to stonezone.com or to Luke's site.
[03:52:28.216 --> 03:52:31.718]  If they just promote, people tell them the truth, it's game over.
[03:52:31.738 --> 03:52:34.120]  So both of you, tell folks how people find you.

[03:53:12.663 --> 03:53:14.204]  This is a great night for democracy.
[03:53:14.224 --> 03:53:16.144]  It's a great night for the Constitution.
[03:53:16.405 --> 03:53:17.465]  It's a great night for freedom.
[03:53:17.885 --> 03:53:20.046]  I can't wait to call the big guy and congratulate him.
[03:53:20.346 --> 03:53:21.787]  Yeah, please come on tomorrow.
[03:53:21.807 --> 03:53:23.267]  In fact, both of you tomorrow.
[03:53:24.428 --> 03:53:25.068]  We call you.
[03:53:25.128 --> 03:53:25.769]  Come on tomorrow.
[03:53:25.829 --> 03:53:26.449]  Big show.
[03:53:26.969 --> 03:53:28.610]  Just a few hours from now, tomorrow.
[03:53:28.790 --> 03:53:29.830]  Both of you come on tomorrow.
[03:53:29.850 --> 03:53:31.351]  In fact, crew, talk to them.
[03:53:31.411 --> 03:53:32.131]  Get them on tomorrow.
[03:53:32.872 --> 03:53:33.472]  Look, guys.
[03:53:34.973 --> 03:53:36.473]  This is a war against tyranny.
[03:53:37.754 --> 03:53:42.856]  And I see God come through over and over and over again in these fights.
[03:53:44.377 --> 03:53:46.118]  Evil isn't the only power in the universe.
[03:53:46.991 --> 03:53:48.131]  There is good as well.
[03:53:49.772 --> 03:53:55.573]  And so, I'm just asking all of you to realize the amazing things we're doing together.
[03:53:56.613 --> 03:54:00.054]  And to see the fact that we don't have to roll over and be slaves.
[03:54:01.194 --> 03:54:07.696]  And to just support us, to take the articles, the videos, the clips, and share them, which a lot of you are doing, but others aren't.
[03:54:09.536 --> 03:54:16.278]  I know that less than 1% of our viewers and listeners ever buy a product at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:54:18.160 --> 03:54:19.661]  Or at drjonesandactuals.com.
[03:54:20.582 --> 03:54:21.563]  And I'm not mad at you.
[03:54:21.903 --> 03:54:27.468]  I'm like, why are you missing this opportunity to get a great product and fund people that are dedicated to death?
[03:54:28.269 --> 03:54:29.630]  Like, you can put a gun to my head.
[03:54:29.910 --> 03:54:37.577]  The new order can walk in here today and they can put a gun to my head and say, Jones, you better back off.
[03:54:37.977 --> 03:54:39.118]  You better shut up.
[03:54:39.459 --> 03:54:41.340]  You better go away or we're going to kill your ass.
[03:54:41.681 --> 03:54:44.043]  And I tell them, pull that trigger.
[03:54:45.196 --> 03:54:46.036]  Because I'm not for sale.
[03:54:46.877 --> 03:54:49.458]  But I can't fight the tyrants without you.
[03:54:50.518 --> 03:54:54.619]  So go to DonaldJonesNationals.com right now and support the broadcast.
[03:54:55.120 --> 03:54:57.360]  Because we cannot do this.
[03:54:57.380 --> 03:54:59.061]  Am I centering the camera?
[03:54:59.081 --> 03:55:00.682]  I was thinking about centering the camera.
[03:55:01.422 --> 03:55:02.022]  Where do I center?
[03:55:02.062 --> 03:55:02.382]  Over here?
[03:55:02.402 --> 03:55:04.183]  Am I centered yet?
[03:55:04.283 --> 03:55:04.623]  There we go.
[03:55:06.844 --> 03:55:08.404]  So, that's where we are.
[03:55:08.604 --> 03:55:09.865]  I mean, I hate tyrants.
[03:55:10.005 --> 03:55:10.925]  I hate pedophiles.
[03:55:10.985 --> 03:55:11.846]  I hate satanists.
[03:55:11.906 --> 03:55:12.666]  I hate globalists.
[03:55:13.595 --> 03:55:15.657]  But I can't do this without you.
[03:55:15.677 --> 03:55:17.960]  And I'm just saying, I will fight to the death.
[03:55:18.560 --> 03:55:19.481]  I won't back down.
[03:55:19.581 --> 03:55:20.382]  I'll never stop.
[03:55:20.542 --> 03:55:21.443]  I'll interview everybody.
[03:55:21.563 --> 03:55:24.947]  I'll go 110 miles an hour through traffic.
[03:55:25.387 --> 03:55:27.309]  But I need you to back me.
[03:55:28.260 --> 03:55:28.840]  It's that simple.
[03:55:29.440 --> 03:55:38.143]  Go to drjonesnaturals.com right now and buy products that support you and your family, that do amazing things, and support the broadcast.

[03:55:50.827 --> 03:55:51.947]  We haven't taken the comments yet.
[03:55:51.967 --> 03:55:58.356]   We did some in the first hour, are about to host, and we have millions Of precious people.
[03:55:58.616 --> 03:56:04.138]  If I had a crowd of 50 people right now, I was talking to, I would just spend hours talking to them.
[03:56:05.318 --> 03:56:06.778]  We have millions of people.
[03:56:07.758 --> 03:56:08.899]  CNN doesn't have that.
[03:56:09.299 --> 03:56:10.479]  ABC doesn't have that.
[03:56:10.939 --> 03:56:12.039]  NBC doesn't have that.
[03:56:12.399 --> 03:56:13.580]  CBS doesn't have that.
[03:56:14.040 --> 03:56:15.100]  NPR doesn't have that.
[03:56:15.500 --> 03:56:19.341]  We, I don't take that as like, oh I'm this big badass, I got billions of viewers.
[03:56:20.305 --> 03:56:22.646]  We are reaching millions of new people.
[03:56:22.706 --> 03:56:35.012]  And if you just decide to take the feed from InfoWars.com forward slash show and band up video, if you decide to go get a vitamin or a mineral product or something at DrJonesNaturals.com, you change the world.
[03:56:35.092 --> 03:56:38.073]  It's your decisions that change the world.
[03:56:39.974 --> 03:56:42.655]  So I'm going to go home.
[03:56:44.035 --> 03:56:44.836]  I'm going to get up at 5 a.m.
[03:56:44.856 --> 03:56:47.137]  I'm going to cook breakfast for my family.
[03:56:47.496 --> 03:56:55.816]   I'll be back here at like 9 a.m. tomorrow. I'll be on air at 11 a.m. God willing, but
[03:56:55.816 --> 03:56:58.775]   everybody's gonna freak out if they're successful shutting us down. They may be
[03:56:58.775 --> 03:57:04.855]   like, "God, he wasn't making that up. You think all this big, long, drawn-out fight's some act?"
[03:57:05.052 --> 03:57:06.313]  This is a fight, man!
[03:57:07.093 --> 03:57:08.614]  This is what a fight looks like.
[03:57:08.935 --> 03:57:09.855]  We're hard to kill.
[03:57:09.875 --> 03:57:10.996]  We're hard to shut down.
[03:57:11.036 --> 03:57:12.116]  We got God on our side.
[03:57:13.137 --> 03:57:14.958]  But we're so close to being shut down.
[03:57:14.998 --> 03:57:19.121]  We need your prayer and your support right now at drjonesnaturals.com.
[03:57:20.276 --> 03:57:20.957]  I thank you all.
[03:57:21.497 --> 03:57:25.901]  All right, Owen Schroer and Chase Geiser take over now.

[03:57:36.089 --> 03:57:36.889]  Twelve products.

[03:57:41.493 --> 03:57:42.414]  These are game-changing.
[03:57:42.454 --> 03:57:42.994]  They're amazing.
[03:57:43.214 --> 03:57:44.776]  All of them are of the highest quality.
[03:57:45.116 --> 03:57:48.719]  The Nano Silver Toothpaste and Wound Gel and Immune Gargle.

[03:58:30.290 --> 03:58:31.470]  It's been sold out for a while.
[03:58:31.710 --> 03:58:34.211]  It is pure deep-earth crystal iodine.
[03:58:34.371 --> 03:58:35.371]  It's so hard to make.
[03:58:35.451 --> 03:58:41.273]  You've got to have DEA-approved labs to do it, and it takes months and months to break it down in this special patented process.
[03:58:41.833 --> 03:58:43.894]  Nobody else has true nascent iodine.
[03:58:44.234 --> 03:58:49.876]  They put it on the label, but it's still bound to other elements, and it's not fully absorbable by the cells.
[03:58:50.016 --> 03:58:50.896]  It's the missing link.
[03:58:51.016 --> 03:58:54.777]  Even the UN estimates two-plus billion people have cognitive disabilities because of iodine.
[03:58:54.976 --> 03:58:59.296]   efficiency up until the 30s we had major IQ reduction because of lack of iodine in the
[03:58:59.296 --> 03:59:01.536]  US food supply, especially in the US Midwest.
[03:59:01.536 --> 03:59:06.895]   From the 30s to the early 80s, the government put crappy iodine in the salt by law.
[03:59:06.895 --> 03:59:11.056]   And IQs went up 15 points on average, Burton effects went way down.
[03:59:11.056 --> 03:59:12.936]  And in the early 80s they took it out again.
[03:59:12.936 --> 03:59:17.056]   This is the deep earth crystal pure, meaning atomic, on the atomic table.
[03:59:17.056 --> 03:59:19.495]  And it goes into the cells at a cellular level.
[03:59:19.497 --> 03:59:25.685]  Survival Shield X2, now available 25% off, InfoWarsStore.com.
