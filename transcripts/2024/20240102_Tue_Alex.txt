[00:00:07.338 --> 00:00:15.106]  In trauma-based mind control, trauma is used to hack into the mind and body's defense systems in order to train a person's behavior.
[00:00:15.626 --> 00:00:17.588]  This is accomplished in three steps.
[00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:21.332]  In step one, the victim's identity is destroyed.
[00:00:21.832 --> 00:00:30.821]  This is achieved by depriving the victim of their basic needs and inflicting pain upon them until they become exhausted, confused, and disoriented.
[00:00:31.361 --> 00:00:37.544]  In this state, they no longer trust themselves and become receptive to guidance from an outside authority.
[00:00:38.284 --> 00:00:44.907]  Step 2, through a strict system of rewards and punishments, the victim is imprinted with a new identity.
[00:00:45.387 --> 00:00:52.150]  The new identity is trained to self-isolate by having it denounce everything associated with the previous identity.
[00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:03.313]  And finally, with step three, through the continued use of trauma, the rebuilding of the victim's new self is crafted and maintained however the mind controller chooses.
[00:01:04.213 --> 00:01:09.354]  For this to work, the subject must remain oblivious to the fact that they are being trained.
[00:01:09.775 --> 00:01:14.996]  This is accomplished by keeping them in a helpless victim state of mind with the use of trauma.
[00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.816]  The entire method requires regular ritualistic abuse to keep the target in the victim state.
[00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:29.163]  Declassified documents show how drugs and sensory overload are used to inflict trauma upon the public.
[00:01:29.744 --> 00:01:36.230]  But high-level slaves are often procured from families with an established history of child abuse.
[00:01:37.191 --> 00:01:49.518]  Intergenerational or multi-generational trauma abuse is when a person abuses their child, and that child grows up to abuse their child, and that person grows up to abuse their child, and so on.
[00:01:49.998 --> 00:01:54.521]  This increases a person's susceptibility to trauma-based mind control.
[00:01:55.425 --> 00:02:03.551]  Experiments with mice have shown that the offspring of a traumatized pregnant mother are born depressed and exhibit problems socializing with others.
[00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:13.558]  A nurturing upbringing by a healthy surrogate mother did not reverse the abnormal behaviors, indicating an in-utero transformation of the brain.
[00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.282]  And bioinformatic analysis revealed long-lasting alterations in the DNA.
[00:02:20.303 --> 00:02:25.867]  This is why the CIA is known for targeting children from families of multi-generational child abuse.
[00:02:26.247 --> 00:02:27.908]  They are easier to mind control.
[00:02:28.428 --> 00:02:31.430]  This is why world leaders are all from the same bloodlines.
[00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.613]  This brutal technique has been used and understood for centuries.
[00:02:36.093 --> 00:02:42.937]  And if a group of people vying for power wanted a loyal army of soldiers, the easiest way would be by breeding them.
[00:02:43.417 --> 00:02:46.920]  And the evidence shows that this is how our society was created.
[00:02:48.044 --> 00:02:58.148]  From the middle of the 19th century and well into the next, hundreds of thousands of orphans were distributed and sold in the United States, and millions worldwide.
[00:02:58.628 --> 00:03:02.770]  They were advertised, delivered by train, and sold at fairs.
[00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:14.075]  In America, these orphans were being managed and distributed by a private organization from Britain known as the Odd Fellows, many of whom were orphans themselves.
[00:03:14.815 --> 00:03:22.239]  The Ancient Order of Odd Fellows is an international fraternity whose members, such as Albert Pike and several U.S.
[00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.822]  presidents during the Orphan Train years, were often members of Freemasonic lodges as well.
[00:03:28.522 --> 00:03:37.108]  With their first official lodge in the United States established in 1819, the Oddfellows are officially committed to educating orphans.
[00:03:37.568 --> 00:03:40.851]  But they seem to have been procuring them and breeding them as well.
[00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:47.976]  The Oddfellows' first female chapter, The Daughters of Rebecca, was founded right before the orphan trains began.
[00:03:48.556 --> 00:03:53.441]  And a depiction of their work shows hints of mass breeding and surrogate motherhood.
[00:03:53.841 --> 00:04:03.750]  They worked closely with the Oddfellows at large institutions known as Orphan Asylums and Foundling Asylums, where many members themselves were born.
[00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:09.760]  The Rothschild banking dynasty provided funding for several of these orphan asylums.
[00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:18.654]  According to Philip Eugene de Rothschild, the family has privately bred over 100,000 offspring, including Adolf Hitler.
[00:04:19.437 --> 00:04:24.060]  This is why pedophilia is so prevalent among the families of world leaders.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.743]  While it is used for extortion, its primary function is for trauma-based mind control.
[00:04:30.223 --> 00:04:34.646]  Because to the mind controller, trauma equals transformation.
[00:04:35.086 --> 00:04:38.328]  And there is nothing more traumatizing to a person than pedophilia.
[00:04:39.168 --> 00:04:45.351]  If you had a million mind-control slaves placed in positions of power, then you could control entire nations.
[00:04:45.792 --> 00:04:49.874]  But only if the masses were also kept in a relative state of trauma.
[00:04:50.694 --> 00:04:51.835]  Greg Reese reporting.
[00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:55.857]  We're live.
[00:04:55.937 --> 00:04:56.978]  First live show of the year.

[00:06:15.991 --> 00:06:20.132]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:06:23.353 --> 00:06:26.474]  It's the first live Alex Jones broadcast of 2024.

[00:06:31.495 --> 00:06:40.057]  To the most contentious, dangerous... If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:40.077 --> 00:06:40.657]  ...election ever.
[00:06:41.915 --> 00:06:46.660]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:48.722 --> 00:06:50.224]  And yes it is, my friends.
[00:06:50.284 --> 00:06:53.407]  We made it into 2024 without a nuclear war.
[00:06:53.507 --> 00:06:54.148]  Praise God.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:13.597]  All right, I've cleared the decks of guests today because I want to cover masses of news and developments and information and take your phone calls on this live Tuesday, January 2nd, worldwide transmission.
[00:07:13.617 --> 00:07:17.981]  I want to invite all the new listeners tuning in.
[00:07:18.001 --> 00:07:19.563]  The show is exploding.
[00:07:21.365 --> 00:07:23.906]  Thanks to all of your hard work and our hard work here together.
[00:07:24.746 --> 00:07:25.886]  We have other great broadcasts.
[00:07:25.986 --> 00:07:28.267]  Harrison Smith, Weekday Mornings, American Journal, 8 a.m.
[00:07:28.287 --> 00:07:30.867]  Central, Owen Troyer, The War Room, 3 p.m.
[00:07:31.087 --> 00:07:33.248]  Central, and a lot of other special transmissions.
[00:07:33.288 --> 00:07:36.709]  Just watch that space at InfoWars.com and Band.Video.
[00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:45.011]  And, of course, on The Real Alex Jones on X, formerly Twitter, and, of course, the InfoWars Twitter as well, or X. Okay, wow!
[00:07:45.931 --> 00:07:55.118]  We've got so much big news here on the military and the economy and the border that's now nothing but a UN-controlled invasion zone.
[00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:58.061]  There's just so much incredible news today.
[00:07:58.281 --> 00:08:05.787]  Sandra Bullock talking about using the tissue of children to stay young, and that ties into the whole underground of what's happening there that's now emerging.
[00:08:06.327 --> 00:08:13.093]  You've got the Jeffrey Epstein, not flight logs, those have already been released, to a certain extent, not all of them.
[00:08:14.397 --> 00:08:18.660]  But we're talking about the client list, The Little Black Book.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:25.424]  Now, supposedly going to be released on January 1st, 2024, but that's a holiday, federal holiday, New Year's Day.
[00:08:26.124 --> 00:08:29.086]  And so we're sitting here at 12.08 Eastern, 11.08 Central, 10.08 Mountain, 9.08 Pacific.
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:44.701]  Waiting, waiting, waiting, but this is just going to be the tip of the iceberg, ladies and gentlemen, but we're going to be tracking that.
[00:08:44.761 --> 00:08:49.663]  The good news is it's trending number one everywhere, not just on X, but on Facebook, you name it.
[00:08:49.883 --> 00:08:55.984]  This entire evil group that's been using blackmail and pedophilia for control is being exposed.
[00:08:56.004 --> 00:08:57.144]  We're going to be drilling into that.
[00:08:58.085 --> 00:09:01.725]  Big developments on the whole COVID power grab front.
[00:09:02.486 --> 00:09:04.426]  I told you this back in August, they were going to try it.
[00:09:05.446 --> 00:09:07.807]  And now blue cities everywhere have reinstituted the mask.
[00:09:08.792 --> 00:09:12.916]  And now they're saying it's about to start in the airport, so we backed them off three months, four months.
[00:09:14.097 --> 00:09:18.260]  Supposedly going to start in September, and they tried to bring it back, but now they are really bringing it back.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:29.110]  They've got leftist cult members going around protesting, demanding it all over the place, and they're fear-mongering that when you get sick it's unnatural, and you've got to have shots, and you've got to be put on a ventilator.
[00:09:30.467 --> 00:09:38.389]  We've got some other big developments on that front as well that are just insane that we're going to be getting into.
[00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:42.611]  Experts say new COVID strain will cause global heart failure pandemic.
[00:09:43.131 --> 00:09:46.232]  Funny, we've already seen a heart failure pandemic in the old and young.
[00:09:47.668 --> 00:09:48.289]  Unprecedented.
[00:09:48.849 --> 00:09:50.650]  Insurance companies admit and never see anything like it.
[00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:56.095]  I have a Fox News piece admitting the insurance companies and others admit record numbers of deaths since the shots began.
[00:09:56.515 --> 00:09:58.497]  Didn't happen in 2000 in the peak of COVID.
[00:09:58.537 --> 00:10:02.980]  Happened once the shots were introduced because they create the spike protein that attacks the heart.
[00:10:03.421 --> 00:10:05.082]  We've got all of that information.
[00:10:05.963 --> 00:10:10.106]  There is just so much we're going to be getting into here today.
[00:10:10.146 --> 00:10:15.711]  But remember, while all this craziness is happening, and while all the New World Order stuff's taking place,
[00:10:16.601 --> 00:10:26.929]  Joe Biden says the number one threat to America, the number one threat to life is right-wing extremism since June of 2021 with this report that's now been fully put into place.
[00:10:27.549 --> 00:10:40.219]  And they're saying brace for white people and evil conservatives to engage in terror attacks and infrastructure attacks on the power grid and more, and on the election systems in the next 10 months.
[00:10:41.295 --> 00:10:43.136]  Absolute balderdash.
[00:10:43.176 --> 00:10:48.659]  Like saying you found a leprechaun riding a unicorn and jumping over rainbows in your backyard.
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.360]  Right-wing extremism.
[00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:51.281]  Give me a break.
[00:10:51.501 --> 00:10:52.381]  Almost done.
[00:10:53.042 --> 00:10:53.882]  Almost non-existent.
[00:10:55.063 --> 00:10:57.304]  But what type of terrorism is there really?
[00:10:57.865 --> 00:10:58.985]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:10:59.886 --> 00:11:03.928]  Balloons flew over JFK Airport during anti-Israel protest.
[00:11:04.008 --> 00:11:05.189]  Possible threat to aviation.
[00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:06.970]  Possible threat.
[00:11:08.419 --> 00:11:15.945]  If you or I rig up a bunch of big balloons, and they were big, with things hanging off the bottom, hard devices, that's what it is, it's a weapon.
[00:11:16.686 --> 00:11:25.072]  One bird going in the engine of an aircraft could knock the engine out and it brought down thousands of aircraft since aviation began over a hundred years ago.
[00:11:27.734 --> 00:11:32.358]  One goose, one duck, in some cases just one crow,
[00:11:35.103 --> 00:11:46.689]  goes into the engine, there's hundreds of these videos, and the plane or even the helicopter, if it hits the controller on the back, the rudder, can make you go down.
[00:11:46.729 --> 00:11:51.551]  There's many foot shots of a plane taking off, bird goes into the engine, plane goes down.
[00:11:53.032 --> 00:12:03.557]  Well, they launched, they're reporting a whole bunch of big helium balloons, you know, by big, we're talking about eight feet across or so, carrying, on the end of a rope,
[00:12:05.481 --> 00:12:08.422]  Some type of large device or weight.
[00:12:08.742 --> 00:12:10.842]  Now, if that goes in your engine, bye-bye.
[00:12:10.922 --> 00:12:13.043]  And so, they did shut down the airport for hours there.
[00:12:13.083 --> 00:12:14.483]  They shut it down across the country, as you know.
[00:12:16.044 --> 00:12:21.505]  And they couldn't take off because they launched them right over the runways.
[00:12:21.585 --> 00:12:22.845]  Now, that's terrorism.
[00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:25.246]  And I guarantee, and I wouldn't do this.
[00:12:25.266 --> 00:12:26.066]  I don't want to kill anybody.
[00:12:27.406 --> 00:12:29.487]  If I went to the Austin-Berkshire Airport this afternoon,
[00:12:30.979 --> 00:12:36.442]  And I launched some of these out in the way of the winds blowing over the runway.
[00:12:37.362 --> 00:12:42.844]  Within minutes, the police would be kicking my teeth in and dragging me in the back of a squad car.
[00:12:43.265 --> 00:12:43.985]  And I would deserve it.
[00:12:46.026 --> 00:12:53.809]  But no, ladies and gentlemen, the left blocks trains and blocks subways and blocks roads while people are having heart attacks and babies.
[00:12:53.869 --> 00:12:57.111]  I mean, some of these things have blocked traffic for like five hours in L.A.
[00:12:59.292 --> 00:13:03.715]  And literally shut down airports and now they're launching balloons.
[00:13:05.336 --> 00:13:06.617]  And they're attacking fine art.
[00:13:08.358 --> 00:13:09.179]  Famous pieces of art.
[00:13:09.199 --> 00:13:10.060]  I mean, you've seen it all.
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:15.103]  You've got all these food production plants being blown up and so much more.
[00:13:15.504 --> 00:13:17.905]  But what else happened?
[00:13:19.566 --> 00:13:27.072]  NYPD Transportation Chief mercilessly slammed after tone-deaf pro-Hamas protest warning.
[00:13:28.273 --> 00:13:28.593]  And so
[00:13:30.011 --> 00:13:32.112]  They're defending them and saying how great they are.
[00:13:32.672 --> 00:13:33.272]  Here's another one.
[00:13:33.353 --> 00:13:41.336]  Massive NYPD mobilization at JFK airport to protect travelers from pro-Palestinian, pro-Hamas mob.
[00:13:43.157 --> 00:13:43.757]  Here's another one.
[00:13:44.137 --> 00:13:48.479]  Car filled with gas canisters slams in a crowd, killing two police investigators.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:49.900]  Possible terrorism.
[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.982]  That's in New York as well.
[00:13:54.502 --> 00:13:54.862]  Right here.
[00:13:54.882 --> 00:13:55.783]  I'll put the documents, guys.
[00:13:55.803 --> 00:13:56.163]  Just shoot.
[00:13:56.263 --> 00:13:57.604]  Right here and I'll move them to that place.
[00:13:57.644 --> 00:13:57.924]  Thank you.
[00:13:58.826 --> 00:14:03.689]  So, car filled with gas canisters slammed into crowd, killing two, police investigate as possible terrorism.
[00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:05.931]  That's the type of stuff we've got.
[00:14:05.991 --> 00:14:07.352]  Oh, and there was more, not just that.
[00:14:07.372 --> 00:14:17.238]  New York firefighters respond to a series of explosions in Manhattan that knocked out power to block areas in New York.
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.661]  Are you starting to figure out what's happening?
[00:14:21.801 --> 00:14:27.004]  Meanwhile in Japan, at least five dead as passenger plane smashes into jet and explodes as 379 rescued.
[00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:33.738]  So it's no game to do this.
[00:14:33.758 --> 00:14:35.560]  That's why they've got these fireworks.
[00:14:36.841 --> 00:14:37.962]  They're like the old-fashioned ones.
[00:14:38.022 --> 00:14:40.184]  It's not like a little cherry bomb that doesn't even do anything.
[00:14:40.604 --> 00:14:43.166]  It's like the old-fashioned cherry bomb.
[00:14:43.787 --> 00:14:56.278]  And if you've got livestock you've got to take care of, or cornfields that crows are in or whatever, or if you have an airport, you just go out with a little pistol and it fires about a tenth of a stick of dynamite out.
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.761]  A little bit less and it explodes and runs the birds off.
[00:14:59.841 --> 00:15:04.343]  Or they put owls up, plastic owls or eagles up to scare the birds away.
[00:15:04.963 --> 00:15:05.603]  Predator birds.
[00:15:08.084 --> 00:15:09.104]  But now it's okay.
[00:15:09.565 --> 00:15:14.867]  Where are the arrests of the individuals that did this?
[00:15:16.927 --> 00:15:23.790]  Launching balloons with ropes on the end, with large heavy material.
[00:15:25.319 --> 00:15:31.401]  That if it got sucked into the engine, which is what those engines do, they suck things in, then you've got a bunch of dead people.
[00:15:33.882 --> 00:15:37.684]  What do you want to bet if they'd have killed somebody with us yesterday, they'd have been covered up?
[00:15:38.244 --> 00:15:49.728]  Because remember, the main terror threats, the evil right-wingers, they're everywhere, shutting down highways, driving trucks into people, screaming Allah Akbar, and, oh, I'm sorry, that's not them, that's the Islamicist ally with the left.
[00:15:50.609 --> 00:15:52.930]  Stay with us, we've got a big broadcast lined up.
[00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:53.650]  We'll be right back.

[00:17:00.029 --> 00:17:03.751]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[00:17:04.091 --> 00:17:07.252]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[00:17:07.653 --> 00:17:12.115]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[00:17:12.755 --> 00:17:14.876]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[00:17:15.196 --> 00:17:23.180]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.101]  This is the Great Awakening.
[00:17:25.621 --> 00:17:29.526]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[00:17:30.006 --> 00:17:36.333]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller and this book is even thicker and even more powerful.

[00:18:04.062 --> 00:18:06.945]  Change in critical information.
[00:18:07.546 --> 00:18:19.500]  The globalists are bombarding us with toxic chemicals hitting us in the air, the water, the food, the 5G, the poison shots, the shedding, GMO, all of it.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:24.183]  But God's given us compounds through nature that do incredible things in our body.
[00:18:24.563 --> 00:18:28.225]  And one of the most important, if not the most important, is vitamin B12.
[00:18:28.305 --> 00:18:36.810]  We've got the best organic vitamin B12, Ultra 12, a bestseller finally back in stock after close to a year being sold out.

[00:18:54.623 --> 00:18:57.085]  The only way you lose is not taking action.
[00:18:57.125 --> 00:18:59.327]  I thank you all for your support, being part of this fight.
[00:18:59.567 --> 00:19:01.569]  Now go to MFULWARESTORE.COM right now.
[00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:07.815]  A lot of people have asked me, why is MFULWARESTORE and MFULWARESLIFE not in a probiotic for more than three years?
[00:19:08.255 --> 00:19:08.996]  The answer is simple.

[00:19:16.903 --> 00:19:21.967]  They got bought by a libtard company and said, we're not doing business with you Mr. Jones anymore.
[00:19:22.728 --> 00:19:27.913]  Finally, we got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.

[00:20:01.559 --> 00:20:05.640]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:06.141 --> 00:20:07.481]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:25.247 --> 00:20:28.988]  Alright, I want to get into the latest on the border that doesn't exist and has now become a
[00:20:30.501 --> 00:20:33.924]  Supercharger to pump illegal aliens into the country and destroy the republic.
[00:20:34.645 --> 00:20:35.966]  And a lot more here in a moment.
[00:20:36.747 --> 00:20:38.889]  But first, I want to go back to what we were talking about last segment.
[00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:40.670]  Look at this headline.
[00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:44.634]  Balloons flew over JFK airport during anti-Israel protest.
[00:20:44.674 --> 00:20:45.915]  Possible threat to aviation.
[00:20:45.975 --> 00:20:46.396]  Red state.
[00:20:47.036 --> 00:20:50.559]  That's a conservative publication with a whitewash headline.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.001]  It's a whitewash.
[00:20:53.339 --> 00:21:00.923]  They shot, they launched a bunch of these, they launched a bunch of these balloons while they had the whole airport shut down and thousands of people couldn't get on their planes.
[00:21:02.824 --> 00:21:07.467]  And massive numbers of flights got cancelled for like the sixth time in two weeks.
[00:21:08.307 --> 00:21:09.628]  It happened also all over the country.
[00:21:10.108 --> 00:21:19.194]  And then large balloons hauling objects, heavy objects under them were put into the air.
[00:21:19.534 --> 00:21:21.415]  That's a weapon, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:23.246 --> 00:21:28.708]  A three-pound bird can knock out the engine and have caused thousands of crashes since aviation began.
[00:21:28.748 --> 00:21:29.328]  That's on record.
[00:21:31.488 --> 00:21:34.789]  Bird strikes are one of the top causes, if not the number one cause.
[00:21:35.149 --> 00:21:40.971]  They debate whether it's bird strikes or collisions with other aircraft, or wind shear.
[00:21:41.071 --> 00:21:43.952]  But those are the top things, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:44.352 --> 00:21:47.773]  High winds, bird strikes, and hitting other aircraft.
[00:21:48.513 --> 00:21:49.573]  That just happened in Japan.
[00:21:49.953 --> 00:21:51.534]  They took off in an
[00:21:53.171 --> 00:22:01.498]  Coast Guard aircraft was in the wrong place and the large passenger jet with 400 people slammed into it, exploding in fire.
[00:22:01.538 --> 00:22:08.023]  It's a miracle almost everybody got out except for the pilots because they were in the front where the small aircraft collided with them.
[00:22:08.984 --> 00:22:10.385]  So this is terrorism!
[00:22:13.968 --> 00:22:20.914]  Blocking highways so you can't get to the doctor when you're having a heart attack or a baby or police.
[00:22:22.481 --> 00:22:24.361]  And fire departments can't get to emergencies.
[00:22:27.002 --> 00:22:28.002]  Blocking trains.
[00:22:28.042 --> 00:22:28.822]  The list goes on and on.
[00:22:28.862 --> 00:22:35.704]  We know the left's attacking trains and derailing them and burning up and blowing up food processing plants.
[00:22:35.744 --> 00:22:39.765]  It's all part of the Extinction Rebellion slash PETA cult.
[00:22:41.085 --> 00:22:43.125]  All funded by the depopulationist globalists.
[00:22:45.006 --> 00:22:50.087]  And then they launched these balloons and it did shut down the flights that were able to take off taking off.
[00:22:52.048 --> 00:22:55.150]  And it's called a possible threat to aviation.
[00:22:55.230 --> 00:23:04.757]  You go launch balloons with the purpose of keeping planes from taking off, that is an act of sabotage and terror.
[00:23:05.237 --> 00:23:15.464]  You tie a rope to it with a big heavy, looks like sandbag to me, the shape of it, but it's heavy, you can see it, a bag, probably weighs 15, 20 pounds, we don't know,
[00:23:16.584 --> 00:23:17.325]  That's a weapon.
[00:23:17.345 --> 00:23:25.271]  When an aircraft's coming in going 300 miles an hour, or taking off going 80 to 100 miles an hour, they're going that speed.
[00:23:26.031 --> 00:23:31.576]  So if you're going 80 miles an hour, and you run into a bag of sand, what's it do?
[00:23:31.636 --> 00:23:35.239]  It breaks every bone in your chest, if it hits you in the chest.
[00:23:35.259 --> 00:23:37.300]  If it hits you in the head, it kills you.
[00:23:39.282 --> 00:23:41.463]  So yeah, the balloon's only going a couple miles an hour.
[00:23:44.426 --> 00:23:45.386]  But hanging off of it,
[00:23:46.383 --> 00:23:47.804]  Is a bag of something.
[00:23:50.285 --> 00:23:55.888]  Plane comes in at 300 miles an hour, it's going to cut that wing right off, or it's going to smash that fuselage.
[00:23:56.549 --> 00:24:10.056]  So, if I went to the Berkshire Airport, and I'm not, this is hypothetical, I have no desire to do this, and I have no desire to kill people or go to prison, probably get the death penalty, be premeditated murder, and if I launch some of these over the Berkshire Airport,
[00:24:11.653 --> 00:24:13.975]  I would go to jail for the rest of my life, and I should.
[00:24:13.995 --> 00:24:16.537]  Nothing's probably going to happen to them, folks.
[00:24:19.039 --> 00:24:20.761]  Imagine if your family was on those planes.
[00:24:21.741 --> 00:24:23.343]  But that just shows the entitlement.
[00:24:23.663 --> 00:24:26.005]  And the transportation head in New York is defending it.
[00:24:26.065 --> 00:24:29.288]  Now, we know you've got a legitimate protest, but please be nice.
[00:24:31.169 --> 00:24:32.190]  It's beyond disgusting.
[00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:33.091]  This is terrorism.
[00:24:33.992 --> 00:24:38.215]  These are weapons systems deployed into the air to crash airplanes.
[00:24:38.716 --> 00:24:39.016]  Period.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.601]  And I, for one, am disgusted.
[00:24:46.182 --> 00:24:49.484]  Helium balloons may have caused 1993 crash, a plane report says.
[00:24:50.044 --> 00:24:52.885]  And that's just a regular balloon.
[00:24:53.205 --> 00:24:57.387]  If a balloon normally gets sucked in an engine, it's going to get chewed up, probably not going to cause a problem.
[00:24:57.507 --> 00:25:03.110]  But if there's a big bag of sand and a rope, what happens when the aircraft hits that rope?
[00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:10.974]  It swings the bag like a mace, like a wrecking ball, into the aircraft.
[00:25:12.193 --> 00:25:12.673]  You see that?
[00:25:13.014 --> 00:25:16.196]  Those are big professional grade weather balloon type systems.
[00:25:16.236 --> 00:25:17.597]  Those aren't stuff you buy at the store.
[00:25:18.517 --> 00:25:19.878]  They reportedly launched a bunch of these.
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.921]  In the direction of the wind over the airport.
[00:25:29.485 --> 00:25:30.005]  Unbelievable.
[00:25:31.846 --> 00:25:34.128]  Thousands of flights cancelled in the last few weeks around the country.
[00:25:35.008 --> 00:25:35.909]  LAX has been a nightmare.
[00:25:38.953 --> 00:25:40.354]  But see, America's the target.
[00:25:40.474 --> 00:25:41.795]  America's the bad guy.
[00:25:41.895 --> 00:25:47.559]  Every single person in America, unless they hoist a Hamas flag, is bad.
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.001]  And we've all got to pay.
[00:25:50.382 --> 00:25:54.545]  We've got to bring the refugees here, says Benjamin Netanyahu.
[00:25:55.966 --> 00:25:56.966]  But isn't it interesting?
[00:25:58.007 --> 00:25:58.948]  And these numbers are accurate.
[00:25:58.968 --> 00:25:59.588]  I've looked them up.
[00:26:00.129 --> 00:26:02.170]  That's how Trudeau stays in power with 27% of the support.
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:09.202]  Because they have a parliament, and they're connessants of parliament just like Canada, just like the UK.
[00:26:10.062 --> 00:26:18.245]  And so you can win with only 10, 15, 20% of the points because you can then cobble together a coalition of the other dozens of parties.
[00:26:19.165 --> 00:26:23.787]  Only 15% of Israelis want Netanyahu to keep job after Gaza war, polls find.
[00:26:24.347 --> 00:26:27.548]  The majority of major polls believe Netanyahu knew it was going to happen and let it happen.
[00:26:27.948 --> 00:26:28.448]  Think so?
[00:26:30.049 --> 00:26:33.130]  Either that or he's totally incompetent and his military chief knew.
[00:26:34.755 --> 00:26:35.956]  But whoever was in command knew.
[00:26:40.558 --> 00:26:44.660]  We're going to be looking at more of that coming up here today.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:58.326]  And I've got more reports dealing with what's happening in the Middle East and what's happening in the situation in Ukraine.
[00:27:00.127 --> 00:27:03.689]  But when I come back, I'm going to get into... We did it, Joe!
[00:27:05.293 --> 00:27:06.494]  That's the Zero Hedge headline.
[00:27:07.354 --> 00:27:13.216]  Monthly migrant encounters, you mean illegal alien encounters run by the UN, exceeds 300,000 for first time in history.
[00:27:13.436 --> 00:27:25.821]  And that's just to turn themselves into them to be given more debit cards and more money and more concierge butler treatment with their baggage taken to wherever they want to go.
[00:27:27.842 --> 00:27:29.523]  Here's some footage of one of the biggest caravans yet.
[00:27:30.831 --> 00:27:34.038]  That's set to slam into Texas in the next 48 hours.
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:35.862]  Let's roll the audio from this.
[00:27:59.201 --> 00:28:02.443]  We're the international workers staying with our blood.
[00:28:02.483 --> 00:28:03.464]  We're not criminals.
[00:28:03.504 --> 00:28:04.524]  This land is ours.
[00:28:07.006 --> 00:28:11.028]  Classic communist slogans.
[00:28:17.953 --> 00:28:19.213]  Nevada did an invasion.
[00:28:19.874 --> 00:28:20.614]  I don't know what it is.
[00:28:21.095 --> 00:28:27.839]  Run by the UN, facilitated and greenlit by the criminal O'Biden in the White House right now.
[00:28:28.626 --> 00:28:29.827]  We're going to come back and get more into this.
[00:28:29.847 --> 00:28:30.647]  The latest on Epstein.
[00:28:30.667 --> 00:28:33.208]  The latest on them trying to bring the mandates back.
[00:28:33.248 --> 00:28:33.869]  It's now official.
[00:28:33.969 --> 00:28:34.889]  Told you we're right again.
[00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:36.070]  Of course we're right.
[00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:36.850]  We don't make stuff up.
[00:28:37.831 --> 00:28:40.352]  Sometimes we can force them to change course and they're like, oh, it didn't happen.
[00:28:40.932 --> 00:28:43.054]  That's the point of us learning about it is to stop it.
[00:28:45.275 --> 00:28:52.619]  InfoWars.com forward slash show is the coordinates to find my show and the other great InfoWars broadcast with the live uncensored feeds.

[00:29:03.148 --> 00:29:04.129]  I'm not on Team Olympics.
[00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:07.831]  I'm not on Team Globalist or Wokism in the New World Order.
[00:29:08.072 --> 00:29:18.320]  I'm on Team Humanity, ladies and gentlemen, that loves God and loves our families and loves humanity and knows that we're destined to do even more incredible things than we've already done together.
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:22.163]  And so, inspired by my conversation with Elon Musk recently,
[00:29:22.483 --> 00:29:22.723]  I think so.
[00:29:39.614 --> 00:29:48.540]  Wear it, it's a great conversation starter, and you know it's supporting the InfoWar that is at the very tip of the spear in the fight for Team Humanity.

[00:30:09.618 --> 00:30:12.561]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?

[00:31:08.905 --> 00:31:10.306]  Winter isn't coming.
[00:31:10.886 --> 00:31:12.186]  Winter is here.

[00:33:55.939 --> 00:33:57.220]  Ten months out from the election,
[00:33:59.184 --> 00:34:00.304]  All hell's breaking loose.
[00:34:01.205 --> 00:34:05.546]  Elon Musk came out and said he thinks 2024 is going to be a lot crazier than 2023.
[00:34:05.606 --> 00:34:08.287]  I think that's an understatement, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:08.787 --> 00:34:17.090]  I want to finish up with what's happening on the non-border, the enemy invasion port.
[00:34:18.891 --> 00:34:26.214]  Here in just a moment, breaking GOP seeks congressional change, constitutional change to offset state

[00:35:45.215 --> 00:35:45.975]  Nobody else has it.
[00:35:46.315 --> 00:35:47.015]  Some claim they do.
[00:35:47.055 --> 00:35:47.435]  They don't.
[00:35:47.475 --> 00:35:48.616]  This is from 12,000 feet.
[00:35:48.996 --> 00:35:50.836]  This is not from iodine salts.
[00:35:51.657 --> 00:35:52.517]  One of our ads says that.
[00:35:52.557 --> 00:35:53.977]  It's pure iodine crystals.
[00:35:53.997 --> 00:35:56.018]  In fact, pull the B-roll of that if you can.
[00:35:56.038 --> 00:35:59.419]  I mean, it's bright, shining, looks like metallic purple.
[00:36:00.099 --> 00:36:04.061]  You throw a piece of it on the ground, it shoots up purple smoke.
[00:36:04.081 --> 00:36:04.841]  It catches on fire.

[00:36:25.982 --> 00:36:28.684]  Pull the top off, purple smoke like I dream of Jeannie shoots out.
[00:36:29.767 --> 00:36:32.471]  You want x2 it is selling out right now.
[00:36:32.892 --> 00:36:44.650]  We should get more in three to four months info or store.com and then it takes up to last batch almost a year to actually produce it and break it down.

[00:38:35.621 --> 00:38:37.062]  They didn't even know I was about to plug iodine.
[00:38:37.102 --> 00:38:39.382]  I did it, and they found that B-roll super fast.
[00:38:39.402 --> 00:38:40.102]  Great job, crew.
[00:38:40.362 --> 00:38:40.662]  All right.
[00:38:41.703 --> 00:38:47.884]  Let's finish up with the border situation, then give the number out, and come back and take your calls interspersed with key news.
[00:38:48.464 --> 00:38:53.285]  And we're also waiting for the Epstein client list, not the Epstein-Lolita Express flight logs.
[00:38:53.905 --> 00:38:54.706]  We have those.
[00:38:54.726 --> 00:39:00.767]  We know Bill Gates and Bill Clinton and Tony Blair and all of them are going there, and Bloomberg.
[00:39:02.813 --> 00:39:04.394]  Little shoes as Trump calls him.
[00:39:04.414 --> 00:39:11.241]  That's a nickname that I didn't know until I talked with some people very close to Bloomberg and they said he has four inch deformed feet.
[00:39:11.261 --> 00:39:13.002]  I'm not being mean it's just to show you out of the intel.
[00:39:14.203 --> 00:39:15.524]  Four inch little deformed feet.
[00:39:16.519 --> 00:39:19.240]  He wears a pair of quote, lucky socks that have holes all in them.
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:26.282]  And he has to stuff size eight tennis shoes with newspapers to stick his feet into.
[00:39:27.142 --> 00:39:29.023]  And that's why Trump calls him little shoes.
[00:39:29.043 --> 00:39:31.583]  Just to show you, we have a lot more intel than just that.
[00:39:32.324 --> 00:39:34.304]  What's going on with old, old Bloomberg.
[00:39:35.085 --> 00:39:39.386]  But so when I tell you Biden's crapping his pants or Bloomberg's got tiny deformed feet.
[00:39:40.126 --> 00:39:42.128]  I'm just letting everybody know that we've got the scoop here.
[00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:45.652]  Especially those on the inside know that we're not playing around with them.
[00:39:46.392 --> 00:39:47.133]  Show breaking!
[00:39:47.193 --> 00:39:48.895]  GOP seeks constitutional
[00:39:50.791 --> 00:39:54.915]  Change to Offset State Electoral Advantage from Illegal Aliens.
[00:39:54.955 --> 00:39:56.977]  This is a Infowars.com article.
[00:39:57.738 --> 00:40:02.482]  Congressman Warren Davidson of Ohio and Thomas Massey of Kentucky proposed an amendment to the U.S.
[00:40:02.522 --> 00:40:09.088]  Constitution this week that would prevent states with large numbers of illegal aliens from being represented more in Congress and the Electoral College.
[00:40:09.108 --> 00:40:11.991]  Because they already are, even though the illegals can only vote in the blue cities.
[00:40:12.452 --> 00:40:14.053]  They passed those laws, they're unconstitutional.
[00:40:15.134 --> 00:40:17.135]  They are not voting in the state elections.
[00:40:17.355 --> 00:40:21.116]  They still do get caught under Democrat command and direction.
[00:40:21.756 --> 00:40:32.318]  But the proportionment in the census of the number of people does go to give those blue cities and blue states more congressional districts.
[00:40:33.439 --> 00:40:34.959]  So you see, they get election fraud.
[00:40:34.979 --> 00:40:40.100]  They get still elections, though the illegals are years away from being able to vote unless they join the military.
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:43.181]  So this is a very fast-moving plan.
[00:40:44.844 --> 00:40:50.485]  Davidson posted on X today saying congressional districts should be drawn based on the population of U.S.
[00:40:50.505 --> 00:40:51.145]  citizens only.
[00:40:51.565 --> 00:40:53.206]  The census should specifically count U.S.
[00:40:53.246 --> 00:40:56.586]  citizens for apportionment of representation.
[00:40:56.646 --> 00:40:57.026]  Only U.S.
[00:40:57.066 --> 00:40:58.607]  citizens represented by the U.S.
[00:40:58.667 --> 00:40:59.067]  Congress.
[00:40:59.107 --> 00:41:04.348]  California has five or seven extra members of Congress because the census used the total population.
[00:41:05.588 --> 00:41:07.748]  I have legislation that would end that practice.
[00:41:09.509 --> 00:41:10.089]  And he goes on.
[00:41:11.991 --> 00:41:16.415]  From there, Massey also issued a message on X, writing,
[00:41:35.509 --> 00:41:38.451]  Co-sponsored this proposed amendment to the Constitution.
[00:41:39.212 --> 00:41:40.492]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:41:40.532 --> 00:41:42.214]  Let's make it go viral and let's point out people.
[00:41:42.594 --> 00:41:44.655]  They don't have to wait until the illegals can vote.
[00:41:45.376 --> 00:41:51.600]  They're voting in the names of dead people and they're already voting because they get new Democrat districts in those areas.
[00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:53.601]  And then it's checkmate.
[00:41:54.242 --> 00:41:55.543]  They've got us in check, folks.
[00:41:55.563 --> 00:41:59.946]  We've got to put them into check and then checkmate right now.
[00:42:00.686 --> 00:42:02.667]  Now, I mentioned this earlier, but just let this sink in.
[00:42:03.027 --> 00:42:04.968]  We did it, Joe!
[00:42:05.008 --> 00:42:14.193]  Monthly migrant encounters exceeds 300,000 for the first time in history, and they estimate that they're not even making contact with the majority of them.
[00:42:14.753 --> 00:42:15.854]  So, we're talking 600,000 a month?
[00:42:19.165 --> 00:42:19.806]  Incredible.
[00:42:19.826 --> 00:42:21.808]  Yeah, look at the size of the caravans.
[00:42:22.389 --> 00:42:23.330]  We were showing you that earlier.
[00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:26.653]  They are just absolutely gargantuan.
[00:42:27.154 --> 00:42:33.400]  Would fill sports stadiums, and they're slamming across the border every single day.
[00:42:35.162 --> 00:42:35.603]  Wow.
[00:42:36.864 --> 00:42:37.385]  Amazing.
[00:42:38.806 --> 00:42:42.268]  All right, when we come back, Biden just did something big with our energy supply.
[00:42:42.308 --> 00:42:43.129]  We'll tell you about that.
[00:42:43.689 --> 00:42:45.170]  We'll get into the latest on the poison shots.
[00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:48.372]  We're here waiting for the Epstein client list to drop any minute now.
[00:42:49.012 --> 00:42:50.253]  And so much more.
[00:42:50.753 --> 00:42:52.994]  Oh, and wait to hear what Illinois is doing, coming after your kids.
[00:42:53.495 --> 00:42:54.575]  Yeah, they're pervs, all right.
[00:42:55.036 --> 00:42:55.436]  Stay with us.
[00:42:59.534 --> 00:43:01.135]  I'm not on Team NFL.
[00:43:01.415 --> 00:43:02.916]  I'm not on Team NBA.
[00:43:03.097 --> 00:43:04.077]  I'm not on Team Olympics.
[00:43:04.358 --> 00:43:07.780]  I'm not on Team Globalist or Wokism in the New World Order.
[00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:18.268]  I'm on Team Humanity, ladies and gentlemen, that loves God and loves our families and loves humanity and knows that we're destined to do even more incredible things than we've already done together.
[00:43:18.428 --> 00:43:24.252]  And so, inspired by my conversation with Elon Musk recently, where he agreed with my idea to call it Team
[00:43:24.932 --> 00:43:25.533]  We're good to go.
[00:44:00.615 --> 00:44:12.421]  We are in the middle of a crude and ugly communist revolution, funded by the big banks as a battering ram into a new age digital economy and a total surveillance state.
[00:44:12.881 --> 00:44:20.885]  All branches of government are attacking we the people and they offer us only one option, a meaningless vote in a rigged election.
[00:44:21.785 --> 00:44:23.626]  What we can do is be prepared.
[00:44:24.106 --> 00:44:32.469]  And you can support the InfoWar by shopping at InfoWarStore.com for products to help you through good times and bad.

[00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:02.951]  Last year we put this book out.
[00:46:03.791 --> 00:46:05.212]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[00:46:05.232 --> 00:46:07.013]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[00:46:07.593 --> 00:46:10.835]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[00:46:11.376 --> 00:46:12.276]  The Great Awakening.
[00:46:12.356 --> 00:46:16.198]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[00:46:16.619 --> 00:46:18.259]  This is such a powerful book.
[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:20.341]  It covers all the globalist plans.
[00:46:20.981 --> 00:46:27.264]  The latest developments, how to stop them, and then gives an alternate plan of a society we could build together.
[00:46:27.584 --> 00:46:28.725]  That's why it's The Great Awakening.
[00:46:29.145 --> 00:46:31.246]  The Great Awakening is happening right now.
[00:46:31.507 --> 00:46:36.329]  You can get signed or unsigned copies of the book at infowarestore.com.

[00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:58.020]  It's a powerful book.

[00:47:01.322 --> 00:47:07.245]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:45.978 --> 00:47:53.805]  2024.
[00:47:46.179 --> 00:47:53.805]  If you're not on the edge of your seat or not in the arena fighting for freedom, you're asleep.
[00:47:55.946 --> 00:47:58.688]  All right, let's go to this next really important group of articles.
[00:47:58.829 --> 00:47:59.889]  Look at this headline.
[00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:05.454]  The Biden administration ramps up domestic oil production, hopes no one notices.
[00:48:07.332 --> 00:48:08.894]  We were the third largest energy producer under Biden.
[00:48:30.063 --> 00:48:38.129]  Before that, we were back and forth number one every year competing with Saudi Arabia and or Russia, but that was always the top three.
[00:48:39.671 --> 00:48:48.838]  Under Trump, we became number one and then became the world's largest exporter, not just producer, and just dominated, broke records.
[00:48:50.404 --> 00:48:55.969]  And of course we had a booming economy, cheap energy and low taxes is the key to that.
[00:48:56.070 --> 00:48:59.233]  Also a informed, hard-working population.
[00:48:59.273 --> 00:49:00.053]  We had all of those.
[00:49:00.854 --> 00:49:11.545]  But the first thing O'Biden did when Obama got back into office through his puppet Biden, first thing Obama did, let's just start addressing him as Obama, and his controllers did,
[00:49:12.799 --> 00:49:29.154]  Was cut off the Keystone Pipeline, pull most of the oil drilling permits, kill drilling in Alaska, and cut off thousands and thousands, over 2,000 spurs and smaller pipelines where they have to be upgraded every 30, 40 years, they have to be repaired.
[00:49:30.592 --> 00:49:34.435]  They pulled the permits so that that couldn't be done.
[00:49:34.615 --> 00:49:43.322]  Then Biden drained, almost completely drained, there's a graph on screen, the strategic oil reserve of its 800 million barrels.
[00:49:44.423 --> 00:49:54.892]  He drained over 360 million barrels or more out of that, down to a little over 300 million barrels.
[00:49:56.293 --> 00:49:59.575]  Now, he then
[00:50:00.831 --> 00:50:08.072]  Lifted sanctions on Venezuela allowed them to become our second largest importer.
[00:50:08.372 --> 00:50:13.593]  So we could import it in and that didn't work because the prices were so expensive.
[00:50:15.133 --> 00:50:17.234]  So he's having to have a communist dictatorship get some money.
[00:50:17.774 --> 00:50:20.254]  He begged Saudi Arabia to increase output.
[00:50:20.314 --> 00:50:20.974]  They didn't do it.
[00:50:22.595 --> 00:50:24.015]  They thought they could cut off Russian oil.
[00:50:24.035 --> 00:50:24.795]  That didn't work.
[00:50:24.995 --> 00:50:26.455]  They just sell it through India and others.
[00:50:29.156 --> 00:50:29.876]  And so now
[00:50:32.028 --> 00:50:34.950]  Biden is quietly taking the controls off.
[00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:45.617]  Remember two years ago when the power was out for a couple of weeks in Texas, and it was in the fine print that Texas, when the Blue Northern was coming in, said, hey, we have to be able to upgrade.
[00:50:46.317 --> 00:50:49.779]  They can flip a switch and turn up the generation on gas and coal plants.
[00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:52.301]  Most of them have already been shut down, most of the coal plants.
[00:50:52.801 --> 00:50:54.982]  And the Fed said, no, we will not give you the permit.
[00:50:55.323 --> 00:50:58.365]  And it's not just multi-million dollar a day fines per facility that does it.
[00:50:58.665 --> 00:51:00.306]  It's also potential jail time.
[00:51:01.383 --> 00:51:06.466]  So the producers weren't able to get the federal authorization until a few days into the blackout.
[00:51:08.067 --> 00:51:11.189]  And by then it took weeks to get it back up to capacity.
[00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:21.115]  And I talked about it, they had national news say I was a conspiracy theorist, even though it was a fact, and I had the state letters and ERCOT and all the rest of it, asking to have the power turned up.
[00:51:21.735 --> 00:51:24.657]  But ERCOT's private and under global control, so they didn't complain too much.
[00:51:26.107 --> 00:51:41.591]  So it was the government turning off the power during the blizzard, and it's been the government the whole time cutting off the permits to drill for oil, drill for gas, and the permits to create new or repair or upgrade old infrastructure.
[00:51:42.051 --> 00:51:43.291]  That's sabotage.
[00:51:43.331 --> 00:51:46.512]  And the average leftist just thinks food just shows up in the grocery store.
[00:51:46.532 --> 00:51:47.932]  They don't know where electricity comes from.
[00:51:47.952 --> 00:51:49.833]  They don't know where their electric cars charge.
[00:51:51.243 --> 00:51:53.985]  They turn their nose up at somebody that's got a gasoline or diesel engine.
[00:51:54.005 --> 00:51:59.510]  They have no idea that it takes more carbon to build that car and to burn the coal to get them the power.
[00:52:01.072 --> 00:52:08.078]  The amount of carbon that a gallon of gas uses for the amount of energy that it takes for electricity to generate power for the car.
[00:52:09.659 --> 00:52:10.480]  And these are facts.
[00:52:13.422 --> 00:52:14.784]  But the system doesn't want us knowing that.
[00:52:14.804 --> 00:52:15.985]  I'm going to give the number out here in a moment.
[00:52:17.537 --> 00:52:26.602]  Here's another headline, Fox News, CCP-tied group is quietly fueling U.S.-based climate initiatives, tax-filing show.
[00:52:26.622 --> 00:52:35.868]  Yeah, because they want us to have to buy the batteries and electric cars and solar panels from them where 92% of that crap is produced worldwide.
[00:52:36.648 --> 00:52:43.112]  Here's another interesting headline, UN predicts disaster if global warming not checked, 1989.
[00:52:43.532 --> 00:52:46.214]  By the year 2000, major cities will be underwater.
[00:52:47.165 --> 00:52:51.086]  Billions will be displaced, entire nations wiped off the face of the earth.
[00:52:51.106 --> 00:52:54.948]  You say, oh that's a fake screenshot, that's not real.
[00:52:55.148 --> 00:52:55.648]  Aha!
[00:52:55.708 --> 00:52:57.589]  The AP has their full archive online!
[00:52:57.609 --> 00:53:00.309]  AP News!
[00:53:00.329 --> 00:53:01.030]  1989, here's the article.
[00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:10.013]  A senior UN environmental official says entire nations could be wiped off the face of the earth and rising sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000.
[00:53:12.568 --> 00:53:13.289]  And they're doing the same thing.
[00:53:13.369 --> 00:53:15.972]  Oh, by the year 2030, we'll all be underwater.
[00:53:16.012 --> 00:53:16.752]  We'll all be dead.
[00:53:17.413 --> 00:53:24.480]  While Obama and Al Gore and the Rothschilds buy more and more oceanfront property at one foot above sea level.
[00:53:25.281 --> 00:53:27.864]  All complete, absolute crap.
[00:53:27.884 --> 00:53:32.289]  So here's the actual shot of it back in 89, of the actual newspaper.
[00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:35.292]  And then here is the AP article.
[00:53:37.495 --> 00:53:39.737]  Digitally for you!
[00:53:40.638 --> 00:53:41.598]  Wow!
[00:53:41.859 --> 00:53:43.000]  What a scam!
[00:53:44.661 --> 00:53:45.562]  What a fraud!
[00:53:46.442 --> 00:53:51.847]  I got some more news I'm gonna hit before we got a break, before we start the second hour, but I want to open the phones up on a huge subject.
[00:53:54.149 --> 00:53:59.173]  With 10 months left to the most important election in world history, what are the globalists gonna pull?
[00:53:59.593 --> 00:54:00.574]  What can we do to stop them?
[00:54:02.295 --> 00:54:04.137]  They're hyping civil war, power outages.
[00:54:05.356 --> 00:54:19.662]  They've already collapsed the border, now they use it as a turbocharging system to pump the UN brainwashed invaders into the country, so they can tip the scales in Electoral College by apportionment, the number of congressional districts as we already covered.
[00:54:22.023 --> 00:54:22.883]  What do you see happening in 2024?
[00:54:22.963 --> 00:54:27.325]  And then we're also going to be talking about the Epstein client list, not the
[00:54:29.232 --> 00:54:29.932]  Flight logs.
[00:54:30.773 --> 00:54:34.815]  Some people that flew on the plane didn't fly to Epstein Island and stuff like that.
[00:54:34.855 --> 00:54:36.796]  They just flew from New York to Florida.
[00:54:37.937 --> 00:54:38.957]  Trump flew on it once.
[00:54:39.998 --> 00:54:42.600]  If I found any evidence of him going after kids, I would hate his guts.
[00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:42.880]  Come at him.
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:43.440]  There is no evidence.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.921]  But if you go to the island, that's kids.
[00:54:46.582 --> 00:54:48.623]  But this is the black book of clients.
[00:54:48.683 --> 00:54:50.644]  This is more important, more powerful.
[00:54:51.044 --> 00:54:52.245]  It's set to be released any moment.
[00:54:52.265 --> 00:54:53.966]  We're checking every two minutes.
[00:54:54.706 --> 00:54:57.348]  Soon as it comes out, we'll be covering it live on air here today.
[00:54:59.039 --> 00:55:00.480]  Toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:00.640]  877-789-Alex.
[00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:00.820]  877-789-2539er.
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:02.981]  And we will get you up and on the air today.
[00:55:03.001 --> 00:55:03.041]  877-789-2539.
[00:55:19.805 --> 00:55:45.034]  789-2539 and really this subject is so big with them trying to steal the 2024 election and all the evidence of it and it's just such a giant, such a giant topic and area to get into and how they're going to try to shut down highways and roads and defund the police and they'll use Black Lives Matter as an excuse, they'll use the Palestinians as an excuse.
[00:55:46.246 --> 00:55:52.851]  And Biden's running around saying that the right-wingers working with Russia are going to knock the power out or have a cyber attack on the Internet.
[00:55:53.511 --> 00:55:54.973]  So a lot of the Internet won't be available.
[00:55:55.013 --> 00:55:56.274]  You'll just get government websites.
[00:55:56.374 --> 00:55:57.234]  Oh, isn't that terrible?
[00:55:58.395 --> 00:55:59.256]  That's exactly what they want.
[00:56:00.076 --> 00:56:01.037]  And now this from RedState.
[00:56:01.417 --> 00:56:01.758]  Yikes!
[00:56:02.478 --> 00:56:05.981]  Ex-CIA analyst warns about Intel agencies being involved in the November election.
[00:56:06.681 --> 00:56:12.586]  They've already been involved censoring and surveilling and blocking the Hunter Biden laptop and thousands of other stories.
[00:56:14.187 --> 00:56:17.349]  They got rid of the law under Obama where the CIA can operate domestically.
[00:56:17.369 --> 00:56:26.874]  According to CIA analyst, now professor at Georgetown University, Dr. John Gentry, he believes the alphabet agencies will try to interfere in the 2024 election.
[00:56:27.515 --> 00:56:29.176]  Yeah, does a bear live in the woods?
[00:56:29.856 --> 00:56:30.837]  Do fish swim in the sea?
[00:56:33.635 --> 00:56:45.587]  My guess is the proverbial deep state within the intelligence community will reemerge because presumably a Republican candidate will again be seen as a threat to the internal policies that many intelligence people like.
[00:56:45.767 --> 00:56:46.908]  Yes, they think it's their country.
[00:56:47.508 --> 00:56:48.850]  It's an oligarchical coup.
[00:56:49.470 --> 00:56:49.831]  Gentry
[00:56:51.994 --> 00:57:00.877]  Turn the effort to downplay the Hunter Biden laptop is clearly political and that in no uncertain terms it was done explicitly for the attempt to help the Biden campaign.
[00:57:01.197 --> 00:57:02.777]  He said he was already seeing signs.
[00:57:03.477 --> 00:57:10.760]  I long have thought we are likely to again see former intelligence officers be politically active against Trump or whomever the Republican president is next year.
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:14.481]  I'm expecting the leaking to resume.
[00:57:14.501 --> 00:57:21.443]  Gentry said the activities of former have resumed already a bit before I expected.
[00:57:22.585 --> 00:57:27.268]  We'll read more of this coming up next hour.
[00:57:27.488 --> 00:57:31.790]  And your phone calls at 877-789-2539.

[00:58:43.799 --> 00:58:45.239]  God bless and we're going into 2024 together.
[00:58:50.435 --> 00:58:56.921]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the global agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[00:58:57.001 --> 00:59:11.134]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections, masqueradings, vaccines.
[00:59:11.977 --> 00:59:16.265]  I mean, it's so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives oblivious.
[00:59:17.627 --> 00:59:20.352]  And you realize ignorance is not bliss, it equals death.
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:42.396]  But people are starting to really understand how serious things are, and that's a hard thing to do, because to wake up to a dystopian reality and realize that we're in the middle of a giant biological weapons war against humanity, and that there's mass sterilization that's already taking place and cutting off all the major energy sources, is really hard to deal with, but it's the reality.
[00:59:42.977 --> 00:59:47.160]  Facing it is our only chance to turn this around, because stuff's about to get really, really nasty.
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:48.181]  InfoWars.com.
[00:59:53.248 --> 00:59:57.159]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:08.209 --> 01:00:09.251]  Well, mine's a little dark.
[01:00:09.431 --> 01:00:13.937]  I just feel a lot of concern that 2024 may be the year of a Black Swan event.
[01:00:14.097 --> 01:00:14.958]  Black Swan.
[01:00:15.559 --> 01:00:17.922]  It is the favorite New World Order term.
[01:00:18.062 --> 01:00:24.371]  The New World Order would have us believe that a Black Swan event is an unfortunate event.
[01:00:24.531 --> 01:00:28.712]  The scenario you will be presented with this morning could easily become one
[01:00:53.161 --> 01:00:55.184]  A shared reality one day.
[01:00:55.905 --> 01:01:02.075]  I fully expect that we will be confronted by a fast-moving, highly lethal pandemic of a respiratory pathogen.
[01:01:02.395 --> 01:01:07.583]  Covid-19 mRNA genetic injections have killed 17 million people.
[01:01:08.797 --> 01:01:09.477]  Absolutely stunning.
[01:01:09.497 --> 01:01:11.277]  Can you please tell us more about the paper?
[01:01:11.798 --> 01:01:12.998]  That's the global number.
[01:01:13.738 --> 01:01:22.520]  We studied many countries in Latin America and in the equatorial region, so we have a representative sample of the world, we believe.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:23.960]  Many injections.
[01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:24.240]  It's what?
[01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:27.040]  It's 10% of the world population?
[01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:28.761]  9% of injections or the other way around.
[01:01:29.201 --> 01:01:35.322]  So the number we extract from our analysis allows us, we calculate the toxicity of the vaccine.
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:37.101]  For all ages.
[01:01:37.521 --> 01:01:45.447]  And the number allows us, given the number of doses that have been given worldwide, to conclude that 17 million people would have been killed by this vaccine.
[01:01:46.007 --> 01:01:58.757]  And having it by time, like by week or by month, and by age group, means that you can actually see when there's a rollout of a booster, for example, which happens very quickly in time for a given age group, you can actually see immediately following it.
[01:01:59.537 --> 01:02:01.178]  Consistently across all countries?
[01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:26.374]  There's a little company called Seegan that no one's ever heard of and they are developing a new type of cancer drug called an ADC.
[01:02:26.675 --> 01:02:33.543]  It's like a chemotherapy drug that's designed to specifically target cancer cells while sparing healthy cells.
[01:02:34.364 --> 01:02:54.288]  Well, this company's been losing a lot of money, and Pfizer just bought them for $43 billion and admitted that they expect over $10 billion in revenue due to a massive rise in cancer over the next coming years.
[01:02:54.788 --> 01:02:58.449]  Now, gee, I wonder what possibly could be
[01:02:59.309 --> 01:03:02.751]  That Pfizer knows is going to increase the cancer rate.
[01:03:03.111 --> 01:03:15.878]  It couldn't be the Pfizer vaccine for COVID that had so many cancer-causing agents, including the SV40 simian virus that was found in the old polio vaccine that gave over 100 million people cancer.
[01:03:16.118 --> 01:03:21.982]  The globalists have already clearly telegraphed that they are behind an inevitable black swan event.
[01:03:22.322 --> 01:03:23.883]  And the rabbit hole is deep.
[01:03:24.343 --> 01:03:25.664]  But we also have to look ahead.
[01:03:26.806 --> 01:03:27.646]  Because you know what?
[01:03:28.147 --> 01:03:29.487]  Our opponents certainly are.
[01:03:30.707 --> 01:03:37.890]  Right-wing extremists already have a plan to literally steal the next presidential election.
[01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:39.851]  And they're not making a secret of it.
[01:03:40.370 --> 01:03:53.055]  Larry Fink of BlackRock sent a letter out to the world saying that ESG is a priority for the asset manager and really was looking to encourage companies to embrace ESG.
[01:03:53.535 --> 01:03:59.357]  I believe there will be a future, Eric, that all investments are going to be looked through sustainability.
[01:03:59.497 --> 01:04:09.685]  The concept of providing Canadians with a universal basic income has sparked significant debate on if UBI is a viable solution for ensuring financial security.
[01:04:09.705 --> 01:04:26.259]  The EU is investigating Elon Musk's ex, formerly known as Twitter, while the bloc's regulator is probing the social media platform for its suspected failure to counter illicit content and disinformation, a lack of advertising transparency, and what it calls a suspected deceptive design of the user interface.
[01:04:26.759 --> 01:04:31.261]  All right.
[01:04:31.681 --> 01:04:33.902]  John Bowne reports are usually five minutes long.
[01:04:33.922 --> 01:04:35.062]  This one's almost 10 minutes.
[01:04:35.082 --> 01:04:35.842]  It's very important.
[01:04:35.862 --> 01:04:38.023]  I'm going to put it out on X in the next hour.
[01:04:38.063 --> 01:04:39.263]  It's also a Bandai video.
[01:04:39.323 --> 01:04:40.084]  Save some lives.
[01:04:40.784 --> 01:04:41.444]  Get it out, folks.
[01:04:41.464 --> 01:04:42.664]  They're getting ready to hit us again.
[01:04:42.684 --> 01:04:44.405]  I've got some breaking news on that.
[01:04:44.425 --> 01:04:44.845]  We come back.
[01:04:44.885 --> 01:04:46.106]  We're going right to your phone calls.
[01:04:46.846 --> 01:04:47.466]  Please stay with us.
[01:04:47.486 --> 01:04:49.727]  The New World Order 2024 Black Swan Tell-All.
[01:04:50.548 --> 01:04:51.530]  Very important.
[01:04:52.031 --> 01:04:52.813]  Lengthy report.
[01:04:52.974 --> 01:04:53.675]  For John, it's lengthy.
[01:04:53.695 --> 01:04:54.698]  It's only about nine and a half minutes.
[01:04:55.159 --> 01:04:56.462]  This is so important to share.
[01:05:00.077 --> 01:05:01.657]  I'm not on Team NFL.
[01:05:01.958 --> 01:05:03.438]  I'm not on Team NBA.
[01:05:03.638 --> 01:05:04.598]  I'm not on Team Olympics.
[01:05:04.898 --> 01:05:08.299]  I'm not on Team Globalist, or wokeism in the New World Order.
[01:05:08.559 --> 01:05:18.782]  I'm on Team Humanity, ladies and gentlemen, that loves God, and loves our families, and loves humanity, and knows that we're destined to do even more incredible things than we've already done together.
[01:05:18.962 --> 01:05:25.184]  And so, inspired by my conversation with Elon Musk recently, where he agreed with my idea to call it Team Humanity,
[01:05:25.464 --> 01:05:29.965]  We've launched two limited edition t-shirts at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:30.245 --> 01:05:34.225]  Let people know that, hey, it isn't about the football games or it isn't even about the UFC.
[01:05:34.686 --> 01:05:38.726]  It's about Team Humanity being under globalist attack.
[01:05:39.046 --> 01:05:49.028]  You can wear it, it's a great conversation starter, and you know it's supporting the InfoWar that is at the very tip of the spear in the fight for Team Humanity.
[01:05:49.368 --> 01:05:54.029]  Get your limited edition Team Humanity t-shirts right now at InfoWarsTore.com and I thank you.
[01:06:01.394 --> 01:06:03.576]  Program leftists failed to silence.
[01:06:04.136 --> 01:06:05.837]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:17.787 --> 01:06:19.768]  It's Tuesday, January 2nd, 2024.
[01:06:20.149 --> 01:06:26.033]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and I'm going to be broadcasting right through Sunday, every day.
[01:06:26.053 --> 01:06:28.775]  I always do a Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:06:30.532 --> 01:06:31.913]  I'll be live this Sunday, Lord willing.
[01:06:32.533 --> 01:06:36.595]  But Saturday, I haven't decided, we haven't decided the exact time yet.
[01:06:36.615 --> 01:06:38.276]  I think it's about six o'clock at night.
[01:06:39.137 --> 01:06:45.701]  We're gonna have a very special live, commercial-free transmission with some very special guests.
[01:06:45.781 --> 01:06:46.961]  And believe me, you'll want to tune in.
[01:06:48.102 --> 01:06:49.183]  And I'm gonna leave it at that.
[01:06:49.243 --> 01:06:50.924]  It'll be a very interesting surprise.
[01:06:52.544 --> 01:06:53.865]  Some big, big guests.
[01:06:54.165 --> 01:06:55.966]  As big as, basically as big as you can get.
[01:06:56.747 --> 01:06:58.568]  So, look for that.
[01:07:00.046 --> 01:07:05.609]  Coming up this Saturday, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:07:06.349 --> 01:07:08.130]  And I'll tell you more about it very, very soon.
[01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:10.471]  All right.
[01:07:11.311 --> 01:07:13.672]  Some stations don't carry that first five, but a lot of stations do.
[01:07:13.732 --> 01:07:15.833]  So we aired a John Bowne report.
[01:07:15.973 --> 01:07:17.434]  It's more lengthy than most of his reports.
[01:07:17.494 --> 01:07:18.594]  It's nine and a half minutes long.
[01:07:19.275 --> 01:07:20.535]  We'll put it on screen for folks.
[01:07:21.336 --> 01:07:23.837]  And that is the Black Swan event.
[01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:31.035]  And how the globalists are basically in a tell-all concerning the Black Swan event.
[01:07:31.676 --> 01:07:33.477]  And it's posted at Band.Video.
[01:07:34.778 --> 01:07:36.920]  It's posted on the front page of Infowars.com.
[01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:39.762]  The New World Order 2024 Black Swan Tell.
[01:07:39.782 --> 01:07:44.366]  And for those that don't play poker, they basically tipped their hand.
[01:07:45.247 --> 01:07:46.568]  Very important report.
[01:07:46.628 --> 01:07:50.211]  I'm going to have it posted as soon as we can in the next hour on X.
[01:07:52.685 --> 01:07:54.405]  And we can only get to half of it during that short segment.
[01:07:54.425 --> 01:07:58.446]  I'm tempted to air the whole thing here to millions because you need to see it, you need to understand it.
[01:07:58.566 --> 01:08:05.348]  We have top scientists with the nations that have reporting data, so it's higher than that.
[01:08:05.368 --> 01:08:06.988]  17 million conservatively killed by the shots.
[01:08:08.348 --> 01:08:14.869]  The rest infected with prion crystals that basically create cancer and cut the DNA strand right at the key spot.
[01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:17.370]  I mean, they have hit us and hit us hard.
[01:08:18.479 --> 01:08:21.280]  With a soft kill, delayed reaction weapon.
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:23.040]  I'm sorry to have to announce that to you.
[01:08:24.641 --> 01:08:26.161]  That's why the illegal aliens are exempt.
[01:08:26.181 --> 01:08:27.922]  They want them as the new replacement population.
[01:08:29.222 --> 01:08:31.203]  But it's just the reality.
[01:08:31.843 --> 01:08:32.463]  It's horrifying.
[01:08:32.503 --> 01:08:33.864]  Here's some more of the news on that front.
[01:08:35.925 --> 01:08:37.105]  And then we're going to your phone calls.
[01:08:37.625 --> 01:08:40.666]  Mass mandates return to healthcare facilities across the U.S.
[01:08:40.726 --> 01:08:41.926]  and blue cities and blue states.
[01:08:42.007 --> 01:08:43.087]  Liberals celebrate.
[01:08:44.144 --> 01:08:45.905]  And now they're saying they're going to bring it back to the airports.
[01:08:46.025 --> 01:08:47.086]  I told you this back in August.
[01:08:47.106 --> 01:08:48.447]  They plan to bring it in the fall and winter.
[01:08:49.467 --> 01:08:53.389]  And we've held it back partially, but here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:53.890 --> 01:08:55.231]  Pandemic forever.
[01:08:55.451 --> 01:08:55.611]  L.A.
[01:08:55.651 --> 01:08:58.993]  County reinstates health care facility mask mandate.
[01:09:00.153 --> 01:09:02.335]  And now the businesses and everything else are following suit.
[01:09:02.415 --> 01:09:03.575]  Told you they were going to try that.
[01:09:03.596 --> 01:09:04.996]  We have all these bizarre videos.
[01:09:06.257 --> 01:09:10.820]  Mike Cernovich retweeted, reposted people out protesting, demanding the mask come back.
[01:09:12.355 --> 01:09:13.876]  Very, very sad, mindless people.
[01:09:15.416 --> 01:09:16.637]  Now here's the really big report.
[01:09:16.977 --> 01:09:17.557]  Zero heads.
[01:09:17.597 --> 01:09:19.618]  It's also AP Reuters everywhere over the weekend.
[01:09:20.338 --> 01:09:25.440]  Experts say new COVID strain will cause global heart failure pandemic.
[01:09:26.801 --> 01:09:29.762]  Global heart failure pandemic.
[01:09:31.482 --> 01:09:34.684]  And they go in and say, oh, scientists around the world and in Japan,
[01:09:35.748 --> 01:09:45.255]  They've looked at the new variant, it has a spike protein on it, they all do, the HIV spike protein, and it attacks the heart and causes viral myocarditis.
[01:09:48.457 --> 01:09:59.345]  Well wait, if it's just the new strain causing it, why have we seen record heart failure, myocarditis, blood clots, strokes since the shot started in January of 2021?
[01:09:59.585 --> 01:10:04.648]  Why does the EPA's own fact sheet in October 2020?
[01:10:06.826 --> 01:10:14.691]  Months before the shot started, predict a list of probable side effects or adverse reactions.
[01:10:15.671 --> 01:10:18.853]  Heart attacks, myocarditis, blood clots, strokes.
[01:10:20.654 --> 01:10:26.998]  And that's just the side effect of these babies going and attacking all your DNA and your testicles and your ovaries.
[01:10:28.019 --> 01:10:31.501]  Big report up on InfoWars.com.
[01:10:36.394 --> 01:10:39.416]  Experts say new COVID strain will cause global heart failure pandemic.
[01:10:40.296 --> 01:10:41.217]  Oh, that's what did it.
[01:10:41.917 --> 01:10:50.241]  231 current former US military service members demand military leaders be court-martialed over forced COVID vaccine, which was experimental and illegal by law.
[01:10:50.901 --> 01:10:53.383]  Service members were significantly harmed by these actions.
[01:10:53.423 --> 01:10:55.204]  That's what the letter first was put out.
[01:10:55.244 --> 01:10:56.824]  Now tens of thousands have signed on.
[01:10:58.225 --> 01:10:59.206]  It's making a big splash.
[01:10:59.226 --> 01:10:59.506]  That's good.
[01:10:59.526 --> 01:11:02.127]  We're gonna have some guests on Thursday dealing with that.
[01:11:02.607 --> 01:11:03.428]  Here's a Fox
[01:11:05.043 --> 01:11:08.546]  News report, Dr. Mark Siegel on what's behind the decline in U.S.
[01:11:08.586 --> 01:11:10.887]  life expectancy for the first time ever.
[01:11:12.348 --> 01:11:17.012]  Up 25% among 35 to 44 year olds and up 90% among 25 to 34 year olds.
[01:11:17.872 --> 01:11:24.237]  But the vaccine which supposedly saved lives, nobody is studying what the long term effects of the vaccine here are.
[01:11:24.877 --> 01:11:27.439]  That's also an elephant in the room.
[01:11:31.282 --> 01:11:32.883]  Didn't save any lives, it was all lies.
[01:11:34.813 --> 01:11:39.556]  Congressman Matt Gaetz supports anti-vax mandate, declaration of military accountability.
[01:11:43.439 --> 01:11:44.139]  That's important.
[01:11:46.281 --> 01:11:48.182]  One month after receiving COVID jab.
[01:11:50.564 --> 01:11:54.426]  Injection woman develops arthritis.
[01:11:54.907 --> 01:11:55.087]  Yep.
[01:11:56.207 --> 01:11:56.708]  New study.
[01:11:59.073 --> 01:12:01.814]  With safety concerns about the COVID shots arise.
[01:12:02.574 --> 01:12:05.376]  New safety concerns about the COVID shots arise.
[01:12:06.616 --> 01:12:10.318]  That's quite a stack of news on that front, isn't it?
[01:12:13.459 --> 01:12:14.639]  I've got more border news.
[01:12:14.799 --> 01:12:19.701]  I've got articles and videos, mainstream news about the globalists consuming baby flesh.
[01:12:21.242 --> 01:12:23.083]  We've got Sandra Bullock talking about it.
[01:12:26.324 --> 01:12:28.425]  We're also going to get into more of that report.
[01:12:29.414 --> 01:12:42.122]  from Boston Georgetown University professor, former CIA about the intel agencies already involved in stealing the next election ten months out and so much more today.
[01:12:42.843 --> 01:12:44.484]  But now I want to go to your phone calls.
[01:12:44.504 --> 01:12:45.425]  We're going to skip this break.
[01:12:46.265 --> 01:12:48.507]  Let's go ahead and talk to Paul in New Jersey.
[01:12:48.567 --> 01:12:49.307]  Paul, you're on the air.
[01:12:49.327 --> 01:12:49.668]  Welcome.
[01:12:50.828 --> 01:12:51.389]  Hello, Alex.
[01:12:51.809 --> 01:12:53.930]  Alex, I want to discuss Vivek Ramaswamy.
[01:12:55.812 --> 01:12:59.174]  For one, Alex, in the Bible, in the Book of Deuteronomy, it says
[01:13:00.034 --> 01:13:03.175]  Thou mayest not set a stranger over thee.
[01:13:04.135 --> 01:13:07.256]  From your own people you shall choose your king.
[01:13:08.616 --> 01:13:17.779]  Now the fact is, Napoleon was born in Corsica of Italian heritage, and he went on to lead the French to disaster.
[01:13:19.119 --> 01:13:25.521]  Hitler, he was an Austrian, he wasn't a German, and he went on to lead Germany to disaster.
[01:13:26.541 --> 01:13:29.382]  And likewise, Stalin was a Georgian,
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:30.841]  It wasn't Russian.
[01:13:31.781 --> 01:13:35.104]  And I would argue he led Russia to disaster.
[01:13:36.505 --> 01:13:47.733]  Now, the fact is, ever since Andrew Jackson, every president of the United States had at least one American-born parent.
[01:13:47.813 --> 01:13:51.455]  And to me, that is the meaning of a natural-born citizen.
[01:13:53.056 --> 01:13:59.601]  And yet, here we have Kamala Harris, the Vice President of the United States, without any American-born president.
[01:14:00.307 --> 01:14:06.248]  We have Nikki Haley, a presidential candidate, without any American-born president.
[01:14:06.368 --> 01:14:09.129]  And we have Obama, who's questionable, and all the rest of it.
[01:14:09.209 --> 01:14:12.410]  So, what is your point about Vivek Ramaswamy?
[01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:19.811]  Well, he likewise has no American-born parents, so I would consider him not a natural-born citizen.
[01:14:19.831 --> 01:14:26.433]  Now, the court might have, and you know, the courts are filled with hacks, and court cases get overturned all the time.
[01:14:27.202 --> 01:14:38.211]  But the fact of the matter is, how do we know either of these people were brought up there from their foreign-born parents to be agents for their home country?
[01:14:38.251 --> 01:14:42.055]  And I notice Vivek Varman Swamy is very bellicose towards China.
[01:14:42.515 --> 01:14:46.959]  Alex, how do we know this guy isn't going to want to use America?
[01:14:47.799 --> 01:14:51.721]  To wage war against China to benefit his real country.
[01:14:52.201 --> 01:14:53.042]  I appreciate your call.
[01:14:53.062 --> 01:14:53.822]  You made your points.
[01:14:54.362 --> 01:14:57.384]  Look, Vivek Ramaswamy is not going to win this election.
[01:14:58.044 --> 01:15:01.285]  Trump gets the vast majority of the Republican votes in the primary.
[01:15:01.906 --> 01:15:03.807]  He gets 70% in national polls.
[01:15:03.827 --> 01:15:05.708]  They're trying to prop up Nikki Haley.
[01:15:05.928 --> 01:15:07.668]  Trump, I know, would never.
[01:15:08.489 --> 01:15:09.429]  That's directly from Trump.
[01:15:10.130 --> 01:15:12.591]  No way in hell he's going to bring her in as his vice president.
[01:15:12.631 --> 01:15:13.271]  That's a rumor.
[01:15:14.112 --> 01:15:16.112]  Trump laughed about it when it was brought up to him directly.
[01:15:16.132 --> 01:15:16.893]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:15:18.499 --> 01:15:26.142]  Ramaswamy is doing serious damage to the globalists when he goes on these debates and when he travels the country and does dozens of interviews a day.
[01:15:26.163 --> 01:15:29.464]  I said I'm gonna skip the break guys.
[01:15:35.487 --> 01:15:36.567]  Let me get back to where I was, okay?
[01:15:46.047 --> 01:15:48.891]  I don't know enough about him because he hasn't been around that long.
[01:15:49.992 --> 01:15:52.616]  And people have the ability to change as well.
[01:15:52.856 --> 01:15:53.797]  Look at Elon Musk.
[01:15:54.598 --> 01:15:55.319]  He wasn't born here.
[01:15:56.841 --> 01:15:58.023]  Elon Musk isn't running for president.
[01:15:59.935 --> 01:16:03.217]  And Elon Musk is devastating the globalists on every front.
[01:16:03.717 --> 01:16:07.519]  I don't like his Neuralink the way he first pitched it, like you just go to the mall kiosk and get a brain chip.
[01:16:07.999 --> 01:16:08.799]  That's a terrible idea.
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:15.022]  Now for blind people and people that need it, for paralyzed, there's going to be thousands of companies and chips.
[01:16:15.543 --> 01:16:18.404]  My uncle was in a motorcycle accident and would be dead right now if he didn't have a chip.
[01:16:19.425 --> 01:16:22.186]  And it's not controlling him, it just simply keeps him from having seizures.
[01:16:24.187 --> 01:16:28.669]  So this whole thing of focusing on Ramaswamy, and you're welcome.
[01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:29.389]  I didn't screen your call.
[01:16:29.409 --> 01:16:29.849]  You called in.
[01:16:29.889 --> 01:16:30.570]  I'm not mad at you.
[01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:31.930]  I think you raised some interesting points.
[01:16:32.190 --> 01:16:33.011]  It's food for thought.
[01:16:33.391 --> 01:16:34.131]  It should be discussed.
[01:16:35.052 --> 01:16:42.935]  But under the Constitution, if you're born here, and we have the law that if you're born here, you're a U.S.
[01:16:42.955 --> 01:16:46.156]  citizen, and we can change that law with the anchor babies.
[01:16:47.957 --> 01:16:52.479]  But Ramaswamy is not going to be president this round.
[01:16:54.614 --> 01:16:57.895]  And certainly down the road, I think he's presidential material.
[01:16:58.896 --> 01:17:07.499]  And I don't have a problem with somebody whose parents came here, became Americans, whose son is born here, being the president someday.
[01:17:08.319 --> 01:17:10.960]  But it's all academic right now.
[01:17:11.841 --> 01:17:12.601]  Trump's the guy.
[01:17:12.621 --> 01:17:14.722]  He's going to get the majority of the votes.
[01:17:15.462 --> 01:17:16.803]  He's going to win the general election.
[01:17:17.323 --> 01:17:18.363]  They're going to try to steal it.
[01:17:19.263 --> 01:17:21.264]  And so that's like the big football games going on.
[01:17:21.844 --> 01:17:22.685]  And instead, we've got
[01:17:23.638 --> 01:17:26.501]  A junior high game going 10 miles away and we're going to go focus on that.
[01:17:27.501 --> 01:17:28.883]  Ramaswamy is extremely smart.
[01:17:29.923 --> 01:17:38.211]  I've asked him all sorts of complex historical questions that someone wouldn't know if they were just being given a globalist script.
[01:17:39.091 --> 01:17:41.754]  I've talked to him on the phone quite a bit.
[01:17:42.294 --> 01:17:43.355]  I've been interviewed by him.
[01:17:43.855 --> 01:17:44.476]  I've interviewed him.
[01:17:44.816 --> 01:17:49.560]  I've watched him and I've watched the questions he's given and I've sat there and asked him questions.
[01:17:49.961 --> 01:17:51.182]  He has a deep
[01:17:52.859 --> 01:17:56.311]  understanding of history and a deep understanding of systems.
[01:17:57.839 --> 01:18:00.020]  And technology, and I think he's super smart.
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:03.560]  Could he be some super deep sleeper cell guy?
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:04.220]  Absolutely.
[01:18:04.601 --> 01:18:05.461]  People say that about me.
[01:18:05.581 --> 01:18:06.461]  I mean, I know I'm not.
[01:18:07.441 --> 01:18:14.763]  But hey, I'm here fighting the open borders, the AI takeover, the pedophilia with the kids, the wars.
[01:18:14.883 --> 01:18:16.523]  I mean, that's real issues.
[01:18:17.183 --> 01:18:22.245]  That's why I don't want to wade into things and make it about who runs the New World Order and who's in control.
[01:18:22.285 --> 01:18:23.565]  We know financially it's BlackRock.
[01:18:24.454 --> 01:18:26.356]  And it's the Rothschilds are the biggest owner of that.
[01:18:26.576 --> 01:18:27.997]  I mean, name names, okay?
[01:18:29.118 --> 01:18:31.940]  They're married to the royal family and the royals hide their wealth.
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:33.962]  I mean, the Dutch royal family's worth trillions.
[01:18:34.602 --> 01:18:36.144]  Elon Musk is not the richest man in the world.
[01:18:37.765 --> 01:18:40.307]  But we just get off it.
[01:18:40.347 --> 01:18:41.208]  And look, I took your call.
[01:18:41.888 --> 01:18:43.549]  I'm not saying you're wrong to call in with that.
[01:18:43.670 --> 01:18:51.276]  I'm giving you my response back that I just don't think that that's something that's even in the cards.
[01:18:53.339 --> 01:18:54.039]  Happy New Year, Alex.
[01:18:54.059 --> 01:18:58.242]  I just wondered if the next president is going to be able to handle the current American military weakness.
[01:18:58.262 --> 01:19:02.625]  Apparently the Martian weapons that we had to deploy against Russia haven't worked.
[01:19:22.088 --> 01:19:36.666]  If you've got Trump in videos that you've showed on your show suggesting, intimating, that nuclear weapons might be used if China did something he didn't like, or North Korea didn't do something he liked, how's he going to handle the fact that we're not
[01:19:37.099 --> 01:19:41.281]  Conventionally ready to handle those peer adversaries.
[01:19:42.041 --> 01:19:44.062]  Well, I want to be 100% clear.
[01:19:44.142 --> 01:19:45.843]  We're never ready to have a nuclear war.
[01:19:46.383 --> 01:19:49.304]  I don't care how good the munitions work.
[01:19:49.324 --> 01:19:51.485]  And our nuclear missiles and bombs work just fine.
[01:19:51.965 --> 01:19:53.145]  They've not been used in Russia.
[01:19:53.185 --> 01:19:53.886]  They've not failed.
[01:19:55.566 --> 01:19:58.768]  And 95% of the Russian missiles have been shot down.
[01:19:59.708 --> 01:20:02.449]  But the fact is, is that we shouldn't be there and I'm against that war.
[01:20:02.469 --> 01:20:05.490]  And look, I gave the topic out of what's going to happen in 2024.
[01:20:07.348 --> 01:20:09.250]  And what is it the deep state's going to pull?
[01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:15.995]  And so I guess these topics of Ramaswani and of Trump and nukes, you know...
[01:20:18.142 --> 01:20:22.825]  I've heard Trump say we'd have peace overnight through strength because the U.S.
[01:20:22.845 --> 01:20:24.866]  funds 80% of what's happening over there.
[01:20:25.006 --> 01:20:25.987]  I agree with Trump's statement.
[01:20:26.407 --> 01:20:28.008]  I didn't see any big wars under Trump.
[01:20:28.688 --> 01:20:36.434]  I saw a major de-escalation and the Abraham Accords and the deal with North Korea and peace with Russia.
[01:20:37.254 --> 01:20:38.875]  I did see Trump stand up to China on the
[01:20:40.316 --> 01:20:41.137]  Economic front.
[01:20:41.617 --> 01:20:42.477]  I thought that was good.
[01:20:42.497 --> 01:20:46.460]  I mean, we have Biden again last Friday saying, you better get ready for war.
[01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:49.802]  If I don't get this $106 billion, we're going to be fighting the Russians.
[01:20:50.602 --> 01:20:54.764]  And they're trying to bring Ukraine to NATO and then say they're attacking a NATO country.
[01:20:56.205 --> 01:21:02.249]  And so do you think Biden or maybe Gavin Newsom would be better?
[01:21:02.289 --> 01:21:04.850]  I mean, just go ahead and elaborate.
[01:21:05.010 --> 01:21:07.632]  So you think you think Trump's not fit to be the commander in chief?
[01:21:08.769 --> 01:21:16.453]  No, I think that he has an old-school view of the military, he has an old-school view of Big Pharma, and he has an old-school view of American power.
[01:21:16.853 --> 01:21:25.117]  And we're entering a phase where America's going to need to accommodate and get along a little bit, rather than just say, we're going to lock you down financially.
[01:21:25.137 --> 01:21:29.800]  A bunch of new countries joins the Monetary Alliance of the BRICS today.
[01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:32.261]  Tremendous impact.
[01:21:32.561 --> 01:21:34.342]  I just think the key is
[01:21:34.915 --> 01:21:36.835]  That the COVID shot weakened the military.
[01:21:37.235 --> 01:21:47.277]  General Flynn just retweeted the letter from all the service members saying that we believe that this was designed to bring down the American military.
[01:21:47.637 --> 01:21:53.698]  If you've got a commander-in-chief that won't accept that the shot was used to bring down our military, how's that problem going to get right?
[01:21:53.718 --> 01:21:54.459]  No, I hear you.
[01:21:54.499 --> 01:22:01.280]  The big elephant in the room is Trump wanted to get the economy going and they lied to him and said it was safe and effective and it wasn't.
[01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:04.161]  And then he won't admit he's wrong.
[01:22:04.181 --> 01:22:05.682]  I mean, that's just something that's there.
[01:22:06.162 --> 01:22:08.203]  What we know is the deep state doesn't want him re-elected.
[01:22:08.243 --> 01:22:09.043]  He's awake now.
[01:22:09.483 --> 01:22:10.944]  Behind the scenes, he knows what's going on.
[01:22:10.964 --> 01:22:17.267]  And so it's a decision the voters are going to have to make, except the deep state's trying to take him off the ballot saying you don't have the right.
[01:22:17.527 --> 01:22:18.507]  Let me ask you this, Peter.
[01:22:18.827 --> 01:22:22.109]  You believe the American people have a right to vote for who they want to, right?
[01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:23.880]  Absolutely.
[01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:33.785]  I believe, just like if a parent told a child, though, there's a thing called psychological reactance, where the fact that somebody's telling you you can't do something increases your desire to do that thing.
[01:22:34.126 --> 01:22:39.348]  And for someone like a rebellious teen, your parent says, stay away from illegal drugs, they might have fentanyl mixed in.
[01:22:39.388 --> 01:22:41.749]  Sure, sure, but it's bigger than that, and I appreciate your call.
[01:22:42.230 --> 01:22:44.631]  The economy was a lot better under Trump, and we all know it.
[01:22:45.869 --> 01:22:50.850]  And people are sick of the corrupt judicial and criminal justice system, so they know a railroad job when they see it.
[01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:55.931]  I mean, it's a lot more than just, you know, dad tells you don't smoke marijuana, so you go smoke it.
[01:22:57.551 --> 01:23:00.372]  And you know, I'll say this for black people, because I've seen the statistics.
[01:23:01.532 --> 01:23:07.273]  Guess what group of people, except for George Floyd, are the lowest group consuming fentanyl?
[01:23:07.333 --> 01:23:08.033]  It's black people.
[01:23:08.834 --> 01:23:10.714]  They hear, this will kill you.
[01:23:11.738 --> 01:23:16.423]  The first time you take it and then they'll make damn sure they're not, you know, smoking dope that's got it or whatever.
[01:23:17.506 --> 01:23:22.611]  A lot of these marijuana pens that are made on the black market have it in it, and it's killed a bunch of people I know, family members.
[01:23:22.671 --> 01:23:23.151]  I'm pissed.
[01:23:24.272 --> 01:23:32.499]  So we all need to get like the black people and worry about something that's killed 120,000 plus people last year alone that we know of.
[01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:35.942]  That's the ones that were diagnosed by a pathologist, a coroner.
[01:23:36.603 --> 01:23:40.006]  A lot of people never got tested right, so it's probably way higher.
[01:23:40.046 --> 01:23:41.668]  I mean, this is a plague, folks.
[01:23:42.602 --> 01:23:48.064]  You know, it's terrible that 1,500 Jews died in the sneak attack on southern Israel.
[01:23:48.964 --> 01:23:49.464]  Okay, great.
[01:23:50.325 --> 01:23:51.465]  Go kill the leaders of Hamas.
[01:23:51.485 --> 01:23:53.166]  Don't just carpet bomb the whole area.
[01:23:54.346 --> 01:23:55.907]  They did finally kill one of the leaders, finally.
[01:23:56.447 --> 01:24:00.188]  But that's the biggest thing in world history and bigger than Pearl Harbor.
[01:24:00.788 --> 01:24:03.169]  It's like saying January 6th is bigger than Pearl Harbor and 9-11.
[01:24:03.209 --> 01:24:04.069]  That's insulting.
[01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:05.350]  Okay?
[01:24:06.705 --> 01:24:12.048]  And so, what about the hundreds of thousands of Americans dying from these shots and from the fentanyl?
[01:24:12.088 --> 01:24:13.668]  That's hitting everybody.
[01:24:13.748 --> 01:24:17.710]  Jews, Gentiles, Asian, white, black, Hispanic.
[01:24:18.250 --> 01:24:21.532]  I mean, you know, to me, I look at the big statistics and I talk about what's really going on.
[01:24:21.892 --> 01:24:22.992]  We shared a report earlier.
[01:24:24.133 --> 01:24:25.533]  The Globalist Black Swantel.
[01:24:25.714 --> 01:24:26.794]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:24:27.074 --> 01:24:33.437]  With top scientists, national graphs, from the insurance companies, from the governments, 17 million people dead from the shot conservatively.
[01:24:35.168 --> 01:24:36.429]  Most numbers are 23 million.
[01:24:36.829 --> 01:24:39.751]  I mean, folks, that's not just some number.
[01:24:40.091 --> 01:24:40.772]  That's real.
[01:24:42.313 --> 01:24:43.894]  That means the globalists are going for broke.
[01:24:44.114 --> 01:24:45.615]  They're getting ready to release some new virus.
[01:24:47.216 --> 01:24:48.877]  And that's what I'm focused on, okay?
[01:24:50.038 --> 01:24:51.398]  Remember, the illegal aliens are exempt.
[01:24:51.699 --> 01:24:52.739]  They don't try to push it on them.
[01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:54.420]  Nathan in Virginia.
[01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:55.501]  Thanks for calling here on the air.
[01:24:55.541 --> 01:24:55.901]  Go ahead.
[01:24:57.422 --> 01:24:57.962]  Hello, Alex.
[01:24:58.443 --> 01:24:59.143]  Thanks for having me, too.
[01:24:59.183 --> 01:25:00.004]  Great to talk to you.
[01:25:00.024 --> 01:25:01.064]  Appreciate everything you're doing.
[01:25:01.084 --> 01:25:01.565]  Appreciate you.
[01:25:02.785 --> 01:25:15.317]  Hey I called to talk about Epstein's client list because I got a feeling that it's going to be the RFK, Trump, all the people they don't like is going to show up on that and they're throwing Bill Clinton under the bus just so it looks fair.
[01:25:16.358 --> 01:25:18.140]  Well I will say this, I will say this.
[01:25:19.481 --> 01:25:23.564]  If it turns out Trump ever went to Epstein Island, I will remove any support from him.
[01:25:24.005 --> 01:25:29.209]  But I know Roger Stone very well, and I know people that know Trump well, a lot of people, I'll leave it at that.
[01:25:29.769 --> 01:25:32.511]  I know women that have dated Trump, prominent women.
[01:25:32.671 --> 01:25:35.994]  I know friends of his, people that stay at his house when they go there.
[01:25:36.614 --> 01:25:43.320]  Roger was his wingman in between divorces, and so Roger knows all about Trump's proclivity.
[01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:45.781]  He gets devoted to one woman at a time.
[01:25:46.582 --> 01:25:47.783]  It's totally obsessed with him.
[01:25:48.023 --> 01:25:48.943]  Totally nice to him.
[01:25:49.263 --> 01:25:50.144]  He's a neat freak.
[01:25:50.204 --> 01:25:51.204]  He wants testing.
[01:25:51.224 --> 01:25:54.026]  He puts Purell on his hands constantly.
[01:25:54.766 --> 01:25:57.968]  And everybody that knows him, he's super cool, playing golf, everything.
[01:25:58.348 --> 01:25:59.728]  He always thought Epstein was creepy.
[01:26:00.809 --> 01:26:08.073]  Something like 15 years ago, he'd been on his plane once when they offered a flight from New York down to Palm Beach where they both live in that general area with Trump's
[01:26:09.252 --> 01:26:14.413]  Mar-a-Lago, and he told Roger he got invited to a pool party or a party.
[01:26:14.433 --> 01:26:17.194]  He gets there, there's all these teenagers, and he goes, oh, that's nice.
[01:26:17.234 --> 01:26:18.374]  Let's the neighborhood kids in there.
[01:26:18.794 --> 01:26:19.535]  They go, no, no, no.
[01:26:19.575 --> 01:26:20.455]  These are the entertainment.
[01:26:20.815 --> 01:26:22.475]  And Trump left immediately.
[01:26:23.476 --> 01:26:24.896]  So that's speculation.
[01:26:25.976 --> 01:26:31.858]  But if they put out a client list in here, that's possible that it could be fake because Epstein's dead.
[01:26:32.884 --> 01:26:34.644]  And that's something very possible.
[01:26:34.704 --> 01:26:37.605]  So we'll have to decide, is it a fake list they put in?
[01:26:37.625 --> 01:26:40.866]  Because the CIA was in charge of that with Mossad and MI6.
[01:26:40.906 --> 01:26:42.546]  All three of those groups that's come out were running it.
[01:26:42.966 --> 01:26:47.267]  Would they put out a fake flight log list to get Trump, or did he really go there?
[01:26:47.627 --> 01:26:49.228]  I think that's really an important question.
[01:26:49.248 --> 01:26:52.528]  I mean, are you going to believe them if they put it out?
[01:26:52.768 --> 01:26:56.089]  I personally am not, just from my past research and experience.
[01:26:56.469 --> 01:26:59.230]  See, I've studied not really sociology or psychology, but I
[01:27:00.666 --> 01:27:01.507]  I don't have the terms.
[01:27:01.587 --> 01:27:02.329]  Use the terms they do.
[01:27:02.369 --> 01:27:03.370]  I just see how it works.
[01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:09.900]  And so Trump's type is bombshell imposing supermodels, which a lot of guys are intimidated by.
[01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:15.287]  I'm not intimidated by a big, powerful, inner prime woman that just comes and jumps on top of you.
[01:27:16.269 --> 01:27:21.316]  But these creepy old globalists, they're into kids because they like the evil of it, the power of it.
[01:27:21.817 --> 01:27:25.022]  And they show pictures of, you know, Trump's daughter sitting in his lap.
[01:27:25.502 --> 01:27:27.085]  And they go, oh look, he's a pervert.
[01:27:27.105 --> 01:27:28.867]  I can show you pictures of my daughter sitting in my lap.
[01:27:29.188 --> 01:27:30.810]  So it's just ridiculous.
[01:27:31.571 --> 01:27:37.713]  Uh, and, you know, my 20-year-old daughter, almost 20, 19, I was just hunting with her and hanging out at my dad's property.
[01:27:37.993 --> 01:27:40.114]  She was constantly sitting in my lap and kissing on me.
[01:27:40.274 --> 01:27:40.994]  That's my daughter.
[01:27:41.014 --> 01:27:42.074]  There's nothing sick about that.
[01:27:42.294 --> 01:27:44.555]  People have sick things in their head that think that.
[01:27:44.955 --> 01:27:46.256]  So my daughters love me.
[01:27:46.576 --> 01:27:48.736]  They're constantly kissing me and hugging me because I'm their daddy.
[01:27:49.416 --> 01:27:52.477]  Uh, but, uh, elaborate on what, you know what, stay there.
[01:27:52.978 --> 01:27:53.538]  Did he hang up?
[01:27:55.858 --> 01:27:56.499]  Which caller is he?
[01:27:57.239 --> 01:27:57.639]  It's Nathan.
[01:27:58.019 --> 01:27:58.759]  Nathan, don't hang up.
[01:27:58.779 --> 01:28:00.060]  I'm going to give you the floor when we come back.
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:00.880]  I don't want to cut you short.
[01:28:02.554 --> 01:28:03.895]  But I think that's why I take calls.
[01:28:04.195 --> 01:28:05.135]  I don't think that's why I take calls.
[01:28:05.155 --> 01:28:06.096]  That's why I like to take calls.
[01:28:06.156 --> 01:28:11.018]  Because I think what he brought up is something I didn't even think about.
[01:28:11.078 --> 01:28:15.600]  And now that he says it, now that Nathan says it, we're all going, oh yeah.
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:17.181]  I know this.
[01:28:17.221 --> 01:28:18.761]  They filed fake stuff on me in court.
[01:28:19.482 --> 01:28:21.202]  They got up there and said, we've examined his books.
[01:28:21.763 --> 01:28:22.343]  Certified.
[01:28:22.543 --> 01:28:23.343]  Never examined the books.
[01:28:24.344 --> 01:28:25.124]  Didn't put it in evidence.
[01:28:25.444 --> 01:28:26.065]  He's got $400 million.
[01:28:28.072 --> 01:28:31.354]  I had a couple million bucks in the bank and had bills of over that amount.
[01:28:31.374 --> 01:28:32.674]  So I was upside down at the trial.
[01:28:33.314 --> 01:28:34.115]  Hadn't paid the bills yet.
[01:28:34.835 --> 01:28:38.037]  And I said, here's my certified bankruptcy, here's my certified tax returns.
[01:28:38.737 --> 01:28:41.578]  And she said, nope, you've got a lot of money, you're not speaking.
[01:28:41.898 --> 01:28:43.439]  They put that fake guy up there on the stand.
[01:28:44.319 --> 01:28:51.023]  So, I'll tell you, unless I see forensically studied photos and witnesses seeing Trump there, I don't believe it.
[01:28:52.143 --> 01:28:53.624]  And I think that's really what it comes down to.
[01:28:53.644 --> 01:28:56.165]  I want to see witnesses he was there, I want to see photos.
[01:28:58.387 --> 01:28:59.908]  I'm not on team NFL.
[01:29:00.208 --> 01:29:01.709]  I'm not on team NBA.
[01:29:01.889 --> 01:29:02.870]  I'm not on team Olympics.
[01:29:03.150 --> 01:29:06.592]  I'm not on team globalist or wokeism in the new world order.
[01:29:06.812 --> 01:29:17.038]  I'm on team humanity, ladies and gentlemen, that loves God and loves our families and loves humanity and knows that we're destined to do even more incredible things than we've already done together.
[01:29:17.218 --> 01:29:20.900]  And so, inspired by my conversation with Elon Musk recently,
[01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:28.245]  Before he agreed with my idea to call it Team Humanity, we've launched two limited edition t-shirts at infowarestore.com.
[01:29:28.505 --> 01:29:32.447]  Let people know that, hey, it isn't about the football games, or is it even about the UFC?
[01:29:32.948 --> 01:29:36.990]  It's about Team Humanity being under globalist attack.
[01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.631]  You kid.

[01:31:03.986 --> 01:31:13.830]  The globalists are bombarding us with toxic chemicals hitting us in the air, the water, the food, the 5G, the poison shots, the shedding.
[01:31:14.830 --> 01:31:15.350]  We're good.
[01:31:38.437 --> 01:31:38.797]  I think so.

[01:33:25.684 --> 01:33:27.265]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:31.006 --> 01:33:35.987]  Well, Harvard, race war, New World Order, CIA, plant.
[01:33:37.508 --> 01:33:39.868]  I'm not saying it's the CIA, but the whole race war thing is.
[01:33:39.928 --> 01:33:42.789]  Admittedly, Carnegie Foundation, CIA run it about the country.
[01:33:43.249 --> 01:33:43.989]  She's resigned.
[01:33:44.049 --> 01:33:46.510]  Harvard President Gay resigns.
[01:33:46.750 --> 01:33:49.071]  Harvard Crimson Student Newspaper reports.
[01:33:51.209 --> 01:33:55.570]  What a horrible, plagiarizing, racist piece of crap.
[01:33:56.590 --> 01:33:57.850]  But they're all like that, folks.
[01:33:57.910 --> 01:34:01.111]  Weaponized against the country to make you hate yourselves.
[01:34:02.511 --> 01:34:03.952]  More Jeffrey Epstein news.
[01:34:04.072 --> 01:34:04.392]  Watch.
[01:34:04.472 --> 01:34:08.313]  Jeffrey Epstein's brother told medical records don't exist on day of mysterious death.
[01:34:08.353 --> 01:34:11.233]  Yeah, because they broke his neck in three places.
[01:34:13.014 --> 01:34:19.515]  Meanwhile, Hezbollah is threatening to target Tel Aviv in light of the assassination of Salah al
[01:34:21.056 --> 01:34:24.679]  Arari, one of the top heads of Hezbollah.
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:28.401]  IDF in the north of the country ramp up on high alert.
[01:34:28.461 --> 01:34:32.784]  Anticipated of escalated hostilities with Hezbollah in the southern Lebanon is high.
[01:34:33.545 --> 01:34:37.507]  Concerns include potential long-range rocket missiles attacks following the Beirut airstrike.
[01:34:40.309 --> 01:34:45.012]  Hamas leader Abu Amir was allegedly among six killed in Beirut.
[01:34:45.072 --> 01:34:47.274]  Suburb drone attack along with
[01:34:49.022 --> 01:34:55.732]  Sala, S-A-L-E, Sala, I don't know how you say that.
[01:34:56.653 --> 01:35:03.342]  Breaking Net, Yahoo's party members, congratulates IDF for Beirut strike, West Bank mobilization,
[01:35:05.137 --> 01:35:12.084]  An attack announced against Israel, so things are escalating very, very, very quickly on that front.
[01:35:12.124 --> 01:35:16.488]  We'll continue to track all of that as it unfolds.
[01:35:17.449 --> 01:35:18.670]  But let's get into some of these articles.
[01:35:18.730 --> 01:35:20.952]  I'm going to go to Nathan in Virginia on his point about Trump.
[01:35:21.513 --> 01:35:28.739]  Bill Clinton soon unmasked as John Doe 36, has identified over 50 names on Jeffrey Epstein's client list.
[01:35:29.585 --> 01:35:34.590]  Nearly 200 names of Jeffrey Epstein's clients expected to be made public today.
[01:35:35.071 --> 01:35:35.851]  But you know the courts.
[01:35:36.492 --> 01:35:37.333]  Might be a month from now.
[01:35:37.713 --> 01:35:40.937]  Bill Clinton to be identified as previously redacted Jeffrey Epstein documents.
[01:35:41.357 --> 01:35:41.978]  Fox News.
[01:35:43.459 --> 01:35:44.540]  Here's some of the flight logs.
[01:35:44.861 --> 01:35:45.561]  Tony Blair.
[01:35:46.222 --> 01:35:47.083]  Mike Bloomberg.
[01:35:49.906 --> 01:35:50.587]  Going to Epstein.
[01:35:50.627 --> 01:35:51.708]  I mean, look at Tony Blair.
[01:35:53.001 --> 01:35:53.721]  Think he's evil?
[01:35:54.742 --> 01:35:57.824]  I mean, these guys are absolutely evil.
[01:35:59.524 --> 01:36:00.245]  Evil incarnate.
[01:36:01.185 --> 01:36:04.247]  Bill Gates' wife, distancing herself more from him, his ex-wife now.
[01:36:05.387 --> 01:36:06.248]  That's just some of the news.
[01:36:06.268 --> 01:36:18.975]  But I wanted to go back, we just joined us, to Nathan, who got cut short by me interrupting in the break, bringing up what, this is a really important question, I should have thought of this, what if
[01:36:20.054 --> 01:36:22.975]  Trump did go to Epstein Island, and I'm not saying he did.
[01:36:22.995 --> 01:36:24.136]  The media is going to run with that.
[01:36:24.196 --> 01:36:25.136]  Jones asked, did he go?
[01:36:25.156 --> 01:36:25.716]  I'm not saying that.
[01:36:25.736 --> 01:36:26.277]  I don't believe he did.
[01:36:27.257 --> 01:36:30.038]  But it's been years they've had this.
[01:36:30.078 --> 01:36:48.306]  The CIA went in and cleaned up his Zorro Ranch in New Mexico, and his pervert sex dungeon in Paris, and his pervert sex dungeon in New York, and his pervert sex temple, child molestation, satanic temple in the Caribbean.
[01:36:49.818 --> 01:36:55.620]  What makes you think they wouldn't put Trump's name on the list as a surprise?
[01:36:57.020 --> 01:36:59.081]  But no witnesses ever said Trump went there.
[01:36:59.121 --> 01:37:01.202]  They saw Bill Clinton, all of them.
[01:37:05.823 --> 01:37:08.444]  Bill Clinton says, well, there are no witnesses that I did anything.
[01:37:08.484 --> 01:37:09.564]  Nobody says anything.
[01:37:09.604 --> 01:37:11.025]  Yeah, because they're all dead or paid off.
[01:37:11.045 --> 01:37:14.986]  Of course, they're going to say King Charles's brother was there because he was.
[01:37:16.297 --> 01:37:26.856]  But I'm not just going to defend Trump, but I'll tell you this, if they bring out some document now, they've had years and years and now Epstein's dead, they could put Santa Claus's name on there.
[01:37:27.317 --> 01:37:28.680]  Hell, they could put my name on there.
[01:37:32.352 --> 01:37:33.513]  That's how these people operate.
[01:37:33.533 --> 01:37:37.596]  Remember, when I was getting sued, they got all the discovery on us, including unopened emails.
[01:37:37.616 --> 01:37:38.336]  They wanted all of them.
[01:37:38.356 --> 01:37:39.517]  The court said give it to them.
[01:37:39.897 --> 01:37:41.078]  They later said I didn't give them anything.
[01:37:41.458 --> 01:37:44.901]  And then, lo and behold, hidden links, invisible links to child porn were found.
[01:37:45.201 --> 01:37:45.821]  We didn't find it.
[01:37:45.841 --> 01:37:46.642]  We never opened the email.
[01:37:46.662 --> 01:37:49.384]  There was somebody attacking me for questioning the shooting.
[01:37:50.765 --> 01:37:53.307]  And the FBI put a letter out saying Jones is the victim of this.
[01:37:53.867 --> 01:38:02.033]  He had never opened or sent child porn, but because the court ordered us to hand over the raw email, they scanned it, found the hidden links and national headlines.
[01:38:02.393 --> 01:38:05.275]  Jones sent child porn to shooting victims' parents.
[01:38:06.596 --> 01:38:08.857]  Not true, not real, but they'll do it.
[01:38:10.198 --> 01:38:10.399]  Nope.
[01:38:11.359 --> 01:38:12.200]  I don't believe Trump.
[01:38:13.459 --> 01:38:14.039]  Was ever there.
[01:38:14.079 --> 01:38:15.320]  There's no evidence he was ever there.
[01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:18.141]  But what do we do if they put him on the list?
[01:38:18.401 --> 01:38:22.523]  Or are you actually saying you believe them over Trump?
[01:38:24.244 --> 01:38:25.624]  Like, oh, there's photos of Trump.
[01:38:25.864 --> 01:38:28.025]  There's photos of Trump with hundreds of thousands of people.
[01:38:30.466 --> 01:38:32.347]  There's photos of me and Trump and video.
[01:38:32.767 --> 01:38:34.288]  Does that mean Trump agrees with me on everything?
[01:38:35.088 --> 01:38:36.029]  Or I with he?
[01:38:36.089 --> 01:38:36.309]  No.
[01:38:37.109 --> 01:38:37.849]  He's a celebrity.
[01:38:39.530 --> 01:38:40.611]  So that's all they got.
[01:38:40.691 --> 01:38:41.071]  And we have
[01:38:44.062 --> 01:38:47.124]  The left funding transgenderism and funding sexualization of children.
[01:38:49.526 --> 01:38:52.608]  We have them coming after our children in the schools, sexualizing them.
[01:38:53.188 --> 01:38:57.311]  We have them trying to break up the families and put children on the fast track to be castrated.
[01:38:59.012 --> 01:39:02.095]  We have the Democrats battling to put all this pedophilic stuff on school shelves.
[01:39:02.955 --> 01:39:06.518]  We have Bill Gates wanting to rape our bodies with his shots, hanging out with Epstein all the time.
[01:39:07.218 --> 01:39:09.480]  We have the real evidence of who's doing this.
[01:39:10.652 --> 01:39:16.793]  And so this red herring I always see of Trump photographed a few times with Epstein at these big socialite parties, of course.
[01:39:19.594 --> 01:39:23.995]  And so, I've been photographed with movie stars.
[01:39:24.815 --> 01:39:29.936]  Hell, I'm in movies with Keanu Reeves and Robert Downey Jr.
[01:39:29.996 --> 01:39:32.617]  and Winona Ryder and Woody Harrelson.
[01:39:33.817 --> 01:39:36.398]  And I'm not saying that they did anything wrong, no, I mean,
[01:39:38.032 --> 01:39:39.013]  Keanu's really nice.
[01:39:39.093 --> 01:39:39.833]  Winona's nice.
[01:39:39.913 --> 01:39:40.453]  Woody's great.
[01:39:40.473 --> 01:39:40.934]  We're friends.
[01:39:41.394 --> 01:39:42.174]  Been friends with Keanu.
[01:39:42.194 --> 01:39:44.116]  Haven't been in contact with him in a long time.
[01:39:44.696 --> 01:39:45.476]  He's a fan of the show.
[01:39:46.177 --> 01:39:46.997]  Had dinner a few times.
[01:39:48.398 --> 01:39:51.580]  But... He asked for more of my films.
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:52.180]  Brought them to him.
[01:39:52.981 --> 01:39:56.363]  Got to know him good when I was an advisor on the set and also in the movie.
[01:39:56.623 --> 01:40:01.346]  But if something comes out randomly about Rick Linklater, been good friends with him for like 23 years, 24 years.
[01:40:03.777 --> 01:40:12.418]  Yeah, I think the timing is just too perfect for, you know, all of a sudden, all these years later, after keeping it hidden so long, they've had time to doctor it up and put
[01:40:34.318 --> 01:40:35.439]  And now they're going to throw it out.
[01:40:35.459 --> 01:40:42.502]  And I think it's going to take RFK is probably going to be on it because I think he was on some of the flight logs at some point.
[01:40:42.642 --> 01:40:46.324]  They're going to get rid of two of one or they think they're going to.
[01:40:47.004 --> 01:40:59.871]  But what I really think we need to be extremely careful of what I'm more scared of than anything is that, you know, Trump was easily influenced by his advisers before that were dead wrong.
[01:41:00.151 --> 01:41:01.792]  And, you know, his ties with
[01:41:02.355 --> 01:41:04.555]  Bill Gates and stuff, he admits to that.
[01:41:05.356 --> 01:41:07.736]  We really got to watch him hold his feet to the fire.
[01:41:08.776 --> 01:41:14.937]  If he's going to be the next president, he needs to know what the deep state really is and what the swamp really is.
[01:41:15.057 --> 01:41:19.818]  It's not just a catchphrase, but he needs to not help those people.
[01:41:20.418 --> 01:41:23.479]  Not, you know, the stuff he did with the vaccines was bad.
[01:41:23.539 --> 01:41:24.979]  The stuff he did with the bump stocks.
[01:41:25.479 --> 01:41:29.720]  That's the whole reason we're fighting the pistol brace ban stuff now.
[01:41:30.478 --> 01:41:34.699]  Well, he's got a better understanding now, but I hear you.
[01:41:34.739 --> 01:41:36.640]  I mean, I'm not a Lester 2 Ables guy, but
[01:41:58.643 --> 01:42:02.626]  We're not voting for Gavin Newsom and for Obama again.
[01:42:02.646 --> 01:42:06.368]  Well, Lord, no, but that's what I'm saying.
[01:42:06.408 --> 01:42:10.611]  That's why we need to be the ones to clean our own house, hold it to the fire station.
[01:42:10.751 --> 01:42:12.653]  I agree with you.
[01:42:12.753 --> 01:42:13.693]  And I appreciate your call.
[01:42:14.194 --> 01:42:15.134]  That's a really good point.
[01:42:15.835 --> 01:42:18.517]  And we really should be thinking about that.
[01:42:18.557 --> 01:42:20.358]  I hadn't thought, what if they forge his name on there?
[01:42:20.378 --> 01:42:21.959]  There's nobody to stop him.
[01:42:24.108 --> 01:42:24.488]  Wow!
[01:42:25.069 --> 01:42:29.152]  Because it was the feds that have had that this whole time and kept it sealed.
[01:42:29.272 --> 01:42:30.113]  Wow!
[01:42:31.113 --> 01:42:34.216]  And all they got to do is blackmail the judge or maybe the judge never got the real list.
[01:42:35.537 --> 01:42:37.278]  They say there's a couple names that are redacted.
[01:42:37.778 --> 01:42:40.320]  Who are the two names they're taking off the list?
[01:42:42.682 --> 01:42:44.604]  People say, oh, why is he, why do you fly?
[01:42:44.624 --> 01:42:48.547]  I think it was twice from New York to Florida because they live in the same place.
[01:42:48.587 --> 01:42:49.587]  That's what rich people do.
[01:42:50.188 --> 01:42:51.389]  They all fly on each other's jets.
[01:42:52.734 --> 01:42:55.535]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Wylde in Wisconsin.
[01:42:55.575 --> 01:42:56.316]  Wylde, you're on the air.
[01:42:56.336 --> 01:42:56.616]  Welcome.
[01:42:57.917 --> 01:42:59.257]  Hey, Mr. Crystal Vision.
[01:42:59.317 --> 01:43:01.598]  Actually, I think it was New Jersey to Palm Beach.
[01:43:02.279 --> 01:43:10.443]  But in 2024 here, I think what we're observing is, you know, kind of like in The Wizard of Oz, the curtain being pulled back.
[01:43:11.235 --> 01:43:14.257]  And people like you and I have been ahead of the curve and beyond.
[01:43:14.277 --> 01:43:15.117]  That's a great point!
[01:43:15.177 --> 01:43:20.460]  If you think 2023 was the year the curtain got pulled back, 2023 has nothing on 2024.
[01:43:20.660 --> 01:43:23.362]  We're going to see that sucker pulled all the way back.
[01:43:24.783 --> 01:43:29.885]  Yeah, and the normies are going to recoil when they see what's behind the curtain.
[01:43:30.546 --> 01:43:40.031]  And it's like how we spoke about before many times, a movable object and the unstoppable force then turns into the immovable force and unstoppable object.
[01:43:40.632 --> 01:43:48.017]  Like a quantum fusion fission reaction, you know, and with Epstein, I think, you know, there's a couple of possibilities.
[01:43:48.257 --> 01:44:01.866]  What's in the cards could be a move to frame Trump, a slow drip control between hidden hands or victims forcing the judicial system, you know, but it's all part of this, like, you know, it's not built back better by Biden.
[01:44:01.926 --> 01:44:06.830]  It's like Biden's border blitzkrieg and, you know, it's.
[01:44:07.990 --> 01:44:10.592]  Like, have you ever heard that song Crystal by Fleetwood Mac?
[01:44:11.653 --> 01:44:11.893]  Yes.
[01:44:13.274 --> 01:44:20.500]  Yeah, it's like that, it's like that song, you know, and 2024 is like, we're going into a trap, but it's a trap known.
[01:44:21.140 --> 01:44:24.443]  So then when it's a known trap, it's more of a showdown.
[01:44:25.464 --> 01:44:26.925]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:44:26.965 --> 01:44:29.166]  Before it was always a trap, it was covert.
[01:44:29.247 --> 01:44:32.709]  Now it's a showdown because the enemy's up and got the mask almost completely off.
[01:44:33.370 --> 01:44:34.290]  Excellent points, Wild.
[01:44:34.330 --> 01:44:34.711]  Anything else?
[01:44:36.144 --> 01:44:37.265]  No, you have a Happy New Year.
[01:44:37.725 --> 01:44:38.586]  Happy New Year to you, brother.
[01:44:38.606 --> 01:44:39.767]  Appreciate you.
[01:44:39.787 --> 01:44:40.348]  Thanks for calling.
[01:44:40.908 --> 01:44:42.730]  Bill in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[01:44:42.770 --> 01:44:43.070]  Welcome.
[01:44:44.471 --> 01:44:45.412]  Yes, Mr. Jones.
[01:44:45.452 --> 01:44:46.353]  Good to talk with you.
[01:44:48.035 --> 01:44:53.880]  There are a couple of callers that discussed Donald Trump and also our military.
[01:44:55.221 --> 01:44:58.944]  Our civilian population has been bombarded with so much propaganda.
[01:44:58.964 --> 01:45:01.226]  These people don't even understand what's going on.
[01:45:01.246 --> 01:45:03.008]  OK, we're at war.
[01:45:04.722 --> 01:45:11.247]  I started following this guy by the name of Michael Yon when he was on your show and you interviewed him.
[01:45:12.248 --> 01:45:18.072]  And he's covering the Darien Gap and all these people that are coming up into our southern border.
[01:45:18.092 --> 01:45:20.915]  And the giant Chinese UN bases they built.
[01:45:20.975 --> 01:45:22.116]  I talk to Michael every day.
[01:45:22.136 --> 01:45:23.377]  He'll be on the show soon.
[01:45:23.437 --> 01:45:24.397]  It's just insane.
[01:45:25.718 --> 01:45:26.119]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:26.875 --> 01:45:29.276]  And people don't realize it, but we are at war.
[01:45:29.556 --> 01:45:32.376]  With the drugs, it was like a shot across the bowels.
[01:45:32.596 --> 01:45:32.856]  Okay?
[01:45:32.896 --> 01:45:34.377]  It's all asymmetrical.
[01:45:34.557 --> 01:45:35.977]  It's all asymmetrical warfare.
[01:45:36.897 --> 01:45:37.338]  Yes, sir.
[01:45:37.698 --> 01:45:40.418]  People need to organize in their respective areas.
[01:45:41.098 --> 01:45:43.299]  They need to check and recheck their supplies.
[01:45:43.939 --> 01:45:46.000]  They need to do a weapons and ammo check.
[01:45:47.020 --> 01:45:48.420]  And you ain't buggin' out anywhere.
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:49.360]  This is our country.
[01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:52.321]  They need to stand strong.
[01:45:53.221 --> 01:45:55.422]  They need to prepare to do battle.
[01:45:56.022 --> 01:45:56.262]  Okay?
[01:45:57.284 --> 01:46:00.208]  That's what we need to do as Americans right now.
[01:46:00.228 --> 01:46:00.989]  Okay?
[01:46:01.029 --> 01:46:03.231]  We're so far into this and people don't even know it.
[01:46:07.437 --> 01:46:09.319]  Sir, I couldn't say it any better than you.
[01:46:09.399 --> 01:46:11.021]  I mean, I'm not even afraid.
[01:46:11.041 --> 01:46:12.743]  I'm more sad and disgusted.
[01:46:13.686 --> 01:46:15.467]  Because people are starting to wake up a little bit.
[01:46:15.547 --> 01:46:18.530]  I mean, they know they're being screwed now, but they don't know how bad.
[01:46:18.590 --> 01:46:25.715]  I mean, you understand, sir, they hit 17 million people conservatively are dead from the shots in major insurance actuaries.
[01:46:25.755 --> 01:46:29.017]  The standard of living, the life expectancy is plunging.
[01:46:29.077 --> 01:46:30.298]  Infertility is off the chart.
[01:46:30.658 --> 01:46:31.819]  Cancer is turboed.
[01:46:31.979 --> 01:46:35.702]  I mean, this is horrifying and we're living it.
[01:46:35.822 --> 01:46:37.063]  And I knew this was coming.
[01:46:37.143 --> 01:46:37.984]  I knew their plans.
[01:46:38.504 --> 01:46:42.407]  But it's completely different to know a plan and to be living in the plan.
[01:46:43.371 --> 01:46:48.433]  And we just got to get with God, we got to pray, we got to get serious.
[01:46:49.593 --> 01:46:51.593]  And I mean I used to pray twice a day usually.
[01:46:52.134 --> 01:46:54.274]  Some days two or three times, you know, four times.
[01:46:54.714 --> 01:46:55.375]  Some days none.
[01:46:56.795 --> 01:46:58.816]  I am praying ten times a day now at least.
[01:46:58.876 --> 01:47:01.056]  I mean I am praying all the time.
[01:47:02.577 --> 01:47:10.499]  And it's a feeling of like you're tied up on the side of a highway.
[01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:27.771]  And then somebody pulls up with a group of 23-year-olds that are wearing blindfolds and turn loose in the middle of a highway with cars coming down the road at 100 miles an hour and the people driving the cars have blacked out windshields.
[01:47:28.391 --> 01:47:40.719]  And you're sitting there watching the school bus pull up, they're leading the children out and they're just walking them one at a time out and these cars are just smashing them and driving over them and it's just, it's so wild to then
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:47.324]  Say on X, get into the liberal areas and see their posting, and it's so delusional.
[01:47:48.405 --> 01:47:51.147]  It's just that they are so mind-controlled.
[01:47:51.727 --> 01:47:52.368]  It's really sad.
[01:47:52.388 --> 01:47:53.248]  I appreciate your call.
[01:47:55.690 --> 01:47:57.612]  I mean, I can't think of any other analogies.
[01:47:57.652 --> 01:48:01.755]  It's like an asteroid's coming, and they know 10 years out that it's going to hit the Earth.
[01:48:02.659 --> 01:48:08.621]  With a trajectory and they've got plenty of time to launch some spacecraft with hydrogen bombs on it.
[01:48:08.661 --> 01:48:09.541]  And they've done all the math.
[01:48:09.561 --> 01:48:11.322]  They know they hit it with this many megatons.
[01:48:11.842 --> 01:48:15.263]  It'll blow the asteroid into so many pieces or redirect it off its course.
[01:48:16.843 --> 01:48:18.164]  And they just decide to not stop it.
[01:48:20.765 --> 01:48:21.945]  And then now it's a year away.
[01:48:23.905 --> 01:48:25.366]  And they got photos of it.
[01:48:25.546 --> 01:48:26.946]  Crisp, clean photos of it.
[01:48:27.066 --> 01:48:28.547]  And they know the day it's going to hit.
[01:48:30.187 --> 01:48:31.868]  And they just sit there and giggle and laugh.
[01:48:33.595 --> 01:48:35.175]  They tell you you're a traitor if you want to stop it.
[01:48:39.296 --> 01:48:40.936]  Total death cult insanity.
[01:48:43.357 --> 01:48:58.640]  But as negative as that is, I talk on air and off air to the most influential people in the media on earth, and they're on board.
[01:49:03.422 --> 01:49:05.603]  They call me, they say, well Jones, what about this?
[01:49:05.623 --> 01:49:06.064]  What about that?
[01:49:06.104 --> 01:49:06.844]  What's going to happen next?
[01:49:07.785 --> 01:49:10.507]  And I send them information and then I see them talk about it the next day.
[01:49:12.108 --> 01:49:13.989]  And it's not just some of the most prominent people.
[01:49:16.331 --> 01:49:20.814]  I mean, I get a lot of stuff from Trump, I'll leave it at that.
[01:49:21.534 --> 01:49:25.897]  I get a lot of stuff from Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, you name it.
[01:49:25.917 --> 01:49:26.898]  I mean, I can go down the line here.
[01:49:27.904 --> 01:49:29.384]  And I'm not going to, you know, like Fight Club.
[01:49:29.424 --> 01:49:30.085]  There's two rules.
[01:49:30.125 --> 01:49:30.625]  Fight Club.
[01:49:30.665 --> 01:49:31.705]  Don't talk about Fight Club.
[01:49:31.725 --> 01:49:32.625]  The other rules don't talk about Fight Club.
[01:49:32.966 --> 01:49:34.306]  I'm not going to talk about other stuff going on.
[01:49:35.026 --> 01:49:50.911]  But there are a lot of really serious people that want a pro-human future and are saying we need to not destroy civilization because if the globalists turn it off and try to kill the majority of people, that'll cause mass war and the globalists themselves will be destroyed.
[01:49:50.971 --> 01:49:52.151]  I mean, that's just common sense.
[01:49:52.431 --> 01:49:54.892]  But people like Elon Musk don't have a death wish.
[01:49:56.173 --> 01:49:57.493]  Bill Gates and other people are crazy.
[01:49:59.309 --> 01:50:02.070]  But they just got away with killing 17 to 23 million people.
[01:50:02.110 --> 01:50:03.291]  The low number is 17.
[01:50:04.671 --> 01:50:05.612]  And that's just the beginning.
[01:50:07.053 --> 01:50:10.894]  So of course he's on an airplane going to an island where they rape kids.
[01:50:11.395 --> 01:50:12.595]  They're all about raping.
[01:50:13.015 --> 01:50:14.096]  They don't just rape children.
[01:50:14.116 --> 01:50:15.516]  They rape your medical freedom.
[01:50:15.717 --> 01:50:16.617]  They rape your body.
[01:50:16.637 --> 01:50:17.457]  They rape your life.
[01:50:17.477 --> 01:50:18.498]  They rape your soul.
[01:50:18.518 --> 01:50:24.961]  These are sick, committed to evil people that are dialed into a satanic force.
[01:50:27.230 --> 01:50:28.711]  Tucker Carlson last week was giving a speech.
[01:50:28.751 --> 01:50:29.512]  I meant to send it to the crew.
[01:50:29.532 --> 01:50:30.112]  I don't think I did.
[01:50:30.132 --> 01:50:31.854]  It was when I was on Jimmy Dore.
[01:50:31.894 --> 01:50:33.095]  They played a clip.
[01:50:33.115 --> 01:50:33.755]  Will you guys find that?
[01:50:34.976 --> 01:50:36.037]  Tucker Carlson clipped Jimmy Dore.
[01:50:36.057 --> 01:50:37.098]  I think it's like an hour and a half in.
[01:50:38.058 --> 01:50:38.759]  Maybe two hours in.
[01:50:38.779 --> 01:50:39.580]  It was a three-hour interview.
[01:50:40.380 --> 01:50:42.362]  Tucker says, you know, I grew up around Washington.
[01:50:42.382 --> 01:50:43.182]  I grew up around the elites.
[01:50:43.763 --> 01:50:44.203]  Yeah, I used to.
[01:50:44.223 --> 01:50:45.144]  They were greedy and bad.
[01:50:45.424 --> 01:50:48.587]  But, you know, they were doing something because a political group paid them to do it.
[01:50:48.887 --> 01:50:49.828]  It was about money and power.
[01:50:50.488 --> 01:50:55.212]  The globalists are going out of their way to destroy civilization, even themselves, because they're a death cult.
[01:50:57.182 --> 01:50:59.203]  And that's the term we've all really come to.
[01:50:59.343 --> 01:51:06.265]  I'm not saying who coined it, because it's been used before to talk about Jim Jones and people, but this is a real death cult.
[01:51:07.465 --> 01:51:09.266]  You know, you see these headlines about Giuliani.
[01:51:11.747 --> 01:51:14.808]  You see these women in there and what they were doing in Georgia that night in the footage.
[01:51:16.468 --> 01:51:28.630]  And then the judge says, I default you, the women are innocent, tells the jury, you can't put any evidence on Giuliani, you can't talk, you're guilty, now we're going to see the damages, 147, 146 million, I forget what it was.
[01:51:28.890 --> 01:51:32.511]  Guys, look up the number out of that situation.
[01:51:33.971 --> 01:51:40.913]  It's the same thing where they default you, and then they attack him and said, and he's selling un-FDA approved supplements, he's a fraud.
[01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:43.481]  Ladies and gentlemen, they tried to ban supplements in 1996.
[01:51:44.862 --> 01:51:46.042]  They passed a federal law.
[01:51:47.503 --> 01:51:57.668]  It's like Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or the right of the press, or to peaceably assemble, or petition the government for redress of grievances.
[01:51:58.128 --> 01:51:59.049]  That's the First Amendment.
[01:51:59.129 --> 01:52:00.910]  Congress shall make no law.
[01:52:02.971 --> 01:52:04.932]  Well, $148 million more.
[01:52:04.952 --> 01:52:05.152]  $148 million.
[01:52:05.172 --> 01:52:06.933]  I thought $147 is what my memory told me.
[01:52:11.559 --> 01:52:12.599]  Sit back for a minute.
[01:52:12.619 --> 01:52:13.760]  He doesn't have two million dollars.
[01:52:14.700 --> 01:52:15.100]  He's broke.
[01:52:17.301 --> 01:52:24.083]  But the point is, is that you can buy those same supplements at Whole Foods.
[01:52:24.123 --> 01:52:24.944]  You can buy them from me.
[01:52:26.584 --> 01:52:37.708]  Nobody says Whole Foods or H-E-B or Piggly Wiggly or Publix or Safeway is running a scam when they sell vitamins or herbal teas.
[01:52:39.261 --> 01:52:41.162]  But when we do, they, oh, unauthorized.
[01:52:41.182 --> 01:52:46.203]  There is no jurisdiction of the FDA over supplements, so they're not approved.
[01:52:46.823 --> 01:52:50.004]  They have a law, though, if you call it a drug, then they can come after you.
[01:52:51.864 --> 01:52:55.605]  They don't want you knowing that almost all viral infections caused by vitamin D3 deficiency.
[01:52:55.845 --> 01:52:58.986]  They don't want you to know that almost all cognitive disability is from lack of iodine.
[01:52:59.006 --> 01:52:59.446]  That's a fact.
[01:52:59.486 --> 01:53:00.467]  Government used to put it in salt.
[01:53:00.507 --> 01:53:01.687]  Now they don't, since the late 70s.
[01:53:03.405 --> 01:53:04.666]  IQs went up 15 points.
[01:53:05.106 --> 01:53:09.590]  They sort of put it in the salt by law in the 1920s.
[01:53:11.391 --> 01:53:12.552]  Deformities went way down.
[01:53:12.592 --> 01:53:14.254]  And yeah, this is a plug mixed in with news.
[01:53:15.354 --> 01:53:18.617]  Giuliani sold unapproved supplements, like an unapproved drug.
[01:53:18.817 --> 01:53:20.018]  There is no jurisdiction.
[01:53:20.038 --> 01:53:22.560]  Like, IRS shuts down unapproved church.
[01:53:22.780 --> 01:53:24.501]  IRS has no jurisdiction over churches.
[01:53:26.583 --> 01:53:27.724]  What do you think drugs are?
[01:53:27.784 --> 01:53:31.347]  They're pharmaceutical copies of what was already there naturally.
[01:53:32.503 --> 01:53:33.904]  You know, aspirin works really good.
[01:53:34.084 --> 01:53:34.805]  That's just a plant.
[01:53:35.726 --> 01:53:37.968]  You know, tea, coffee gets you stimulated.
[01:53:38.248 --> 01:53:38.809]  It's a plant.
[01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:44.273]  And they just sit there like we're morons, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:44.654 --> 01:53:46.595]  You know, eucalyptus opens up your sinuses.
[01:53:46.655 --> 01:53:47.196]  It's a plant.
[01:53:49.138 --> 01:53:52.821]  But they can't patent a plant, so they'll find something in a plant, or fish oil.
[01:53:52.981 --> 01:53:54.722]  They're now patenting a version of that.
[01:53:55.003 --> 01:53:57.385]  They'll change the molecule, and then they say they own it.
[01:53:58.973 --> 01:54:02.035]  So this is an example of how Jones sells unapproved supplements.
[01:54:02.196 --> 01:54:04.257]  Because there's no jurisdiction!
[01:54:06.519 --> 01:54:13.204]  So... Please support the broadcast and get these evil supplements they don't want you to have.
[01:54:13.344 --> 01:54:14.505]  Ours are the very best out there.
[01:54:14.525 --> 01:54:15.266]  The cleanest, best.
[01:54:15.746 --> 01:54:16.147]  Iodine.
[01:54:17.389 --> 01:54:18.229]  In atomic form.
[01:54:18.289 --> 01:54:19.110]  Nobody else has it.
[01:54:19.150 --> 01:54:19.810]  Others claim they do.
[01:54:19.830 --> 01:54:20.250]  They don't.
[01:54:21.191 --> 01:54:21.671]  X2.
[01:54:22.431 --> 01:54:22.932]  X2.
[01:54:23.572 --> 01:54:24.172]  Selling out.
[01:54:24.533 --> 01:54:25.033]  Discounted.
[01:54:25.093 --> 01:54:26.293]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:54:27.134 --> 01:54:27.814]  Back in stock.
[01:54:27.874 --> 01:54:28.494]  TurboForce.
[01:54:28.675 --> 01:54:29.315]  10 hours of energy.
[01:54:29.495 --> 01:54:37.619]  All the best known amino acids and other key compounds with wide spectrum natural stimulants that are time released.
[01:54:37.659 --> 01:54:40.260]  So it's 10 hours on average of clean energy.
[01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:43.702]  Unlike, their stuff will keep you up for 10 hours, but you'll feel like you were hit by a truck the next day.
[01:54:44.488 --> 01:54:45.749]  We have other nootropics as well.
[01:54:45.889 --> 01:54:46.489]  They're all different.
[01:54:47.010 --> 01:54:49.972]  RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, but TurboForce is back in stock.
[01:54:50.052 --> 01:54:50.992]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:54:52.013 --> 01:54:52.813]  Storewide free shipping.
[01:54:54.234 --> 01:54:55.155]  Double Patriot Points.
[01:54:57.016 --> 01:55:05.982]  It's all happening right now, but we're going to have to end the sale early next week, because a bunch of stuff is starting to sell out or is already sold out, like the fish oil.
[01:55:06.902 --> 01:55:11.926]  So if you want to get Winter Sun, highest quality D3 to boost your immune system, you're crazy if you don't take it.
[01:55:11.986 --> 01:55:12.686]  Ours is the best.
[01:55:13.106 --> 01:55:13.787]  Take it out of the tongue.

[01:55:35.419 --> 01:55:40.541]  All at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:55:40.782 --> 01:55:48.225]  But that's a government globalist deception, not wanting you to know the power of organic vitamin C, or D3, or B12.
[01:55:48.965 --> 01:55:52.367]  Oh, they're selling that unauthorized stuff!
[01:55:53.948 --> 01:55:56.349]  The FDA doesn't approve of that!
[01:55:58.413 --> 01:56:01.196]  See how they manipulate the word like they don't approve like you were bad to mommy.
[01:56:01.616 --> 01:56:02.237]  You just don't know.
[01:56:02.457 --> 01:56:05.120]  They don't approve because they're not in the department to approve.
[01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:06.401]  It's not their business.
[01:56:08.663 --> 01:56:09.824]  Thank God cars are the right thing.
[01:56:09.845 --> 01:56:10.485]  They tried to ban it.
[01:56:10.765 --> 01:56:12.067]  Europe's basically banned supplements.
[01:56:12.807 --> 01:56:15.931]  They're like on average one-tenth as strong as what can be sold here.
[01:56:16.431 --> 01:56:17.032]  It's baloney!
[01:56:19.798 --> 01:56:23.739]  One time I was watching like one of these doctor shows on ABC or Lister sent me a clip and I watched the whole thing.
[01:56:24.179 --> 01:56:25.860]  And later I said, I bet Bill Gates funded that.
[01:56:25.880 --> 01:56:27.461]  I looked it up, Bill Gates paid for the whole production.
[01:56:27.841 --> 01:56:31.702]  And then there's an Alex Jones character that sells evil supplements, who's a talk show host.
[01:56:32.262 --> 01:56:38.184]  Why don't they want you taking these, but they want you taking the COVID deadly shots that have killed 70 million people at least.
[01:56:38.824 --> 01:56:41.945]  Infowarsstore.com or AAA2533139.

[01:57:03.479 --> 01:57:04.760]  And that's what makes this show possible.
[01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:06.943]  Those of you that have bought the book, you're the reason we're still on air.
[01:57:06.983 --> 01:57:16.032]  And look how we persevered and fought together, and now we're reaching tens of millions a day, conservatively on X. And the establishment's pulling their hair out, and I've painted a bigger target on my ass, but I don't care.
[01:57:16.052 --> 01:57:18.654]  I didn't come to do this to play games.
[01:57:19.659 --> 01:57:27.401]  So, get the book, The Great Awakening, InfoWarsTore.com, and get The Great Reset if you haven't read it.
[01:57:27.421 --> 01:57:29.781]  Or call toll free, 888-253-3139.

[01:57:49.266 --> 01:57:50.847]  I'm not on Team NFL.
[01:57:51.147 --> 01:57:52.648]  I'm not on Team NBA.
[01:57:52.828 --> 01:57:53.789]  I'm not on Team Olympics.
[01:57:54.089 --> 01:57:57.531]  I'm not on Team Globalist or Wokism in the New World Order.
[01:57:57.751 --> 01:58:07.997]  I'm on Team Humanity, ladies and gentlemen, that loves God and loves our families and loves humanity and knows that we're destined to do even more incredible things than we've already done together.
[01:58:08.157 --> 01:58:11.839]  And so, inspired by my conversation with Elon Musk recently,
[01:58:12.159 --> 01:58:14.402]  I already agreed with my idea to call it Team Humanity.
[01:58:14.662 --> 01:58:19.187]  We've launched two limited edition t-shirts at infowarestore.com.
[01:58:19.447 --> 01:58:23.412]  Let people know that, hey, it isn't about the football games or is it even about the UFC?
[01:58:23.892 --> 01:58:27.957]  It's about Team Humanity being under globalist attack.
[01:58:28.257 --> 01:58:28.597]  You kid.
[01:58:29.278 --> 01:58:38.244]  Wear it, it's a great conversation starter, and you know it's supporting the InfoWar that is at the very tip of the spear in the fight for Team Humanity.

[02:00:00.953 --> 02:00:07.197]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:11.246 --> 02:00:12.747]  Now into hour number three.
[02:00:12.767 --> 02:00:13.888]  We're taking your phone calls.
[02:00:14.808 --> 02:00:16.269]  I hope the phone's up over an hour ago.
[02:00:17.650 --> 02:00:25.495]  I threw out the point that I think they're going to try to really cancel the 2024 election.
[02:00:26.316 --> 02:00:28.658]  What are the different false flags or scams you think they're going to pull?
[02:00:29.818 --> 02:00:31.800]  And the callers really haven't called in about that.
[02:00:32.500 --> 02:00:35.262]  They've called in about other topics that kind of fit into that larger discussion.
[02:00:35.282 --> 02:00:35.902]  That's fine with me.
[02:00:36.623 --> 02:00:38.224]  But I really am focused on that.
[02:00:39.622 --> 02:00:41.983]  And on the $17 million debt, at least, from the poison shots.
[02:00:42.484 --> 02:00:44.245]  Daryl in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[02:00:44.285 --> 02:00:44.685]  Go ahead.
[02:00:46.366 --> 02:00:46.666]  All right.
[02:00:46.686 --> 02:00:47.587]  Hey, Alex.
[02:00:47.847 --> 02:00:51.769]  So what I think they're going to do this year is what we've already seen.
[02:00:51.789 --> 02:00:57.733]  You've got some single communist in, I think it's Maine, who just decided she didn't want Trump on the ballot.
[02:00:58.453 --> 02:01:00.334]  I think we're going to see more things like that.
[02:01:00.454 --> 02:01:08.579]  We've got just these individual communist bomb throwers that are trying to harangue us into this civil war.
[02:01:09.218 --> 02:01:18.601]  All this other stuff, and I think the smart thing we can do is just hold on, not overreact, and get Trump and the group behind him in.
[02:01:19.201 --> 02:01:22.262]  In less than a year, you've got your countdown going, which I love.
[02:01:22.802 --> 02:01:24.403]  And I mean, think about our group we've got.
[02:01:24.443 --> 02:01:25.123]  We've got Musk.
[02:01:25.343 --> 02:01:26.163]  We've got Trump.
[02:01:26.544 --> 02:01:27.664]  We've got Carlson.
[02:01:27.704 --> 02:01:29.324]  We've got Brogan, Jones.
[02:01:29.565 --> 02:01:30.705]  I could go on and on.
[02:01:30.745 --> 02:01:31.605]  We've got Flynn.
[02:01:31.645 --> 02:01:37.107]  I mean, we have got a great group of people who want America to stay sovereign.
[02:01:37.634 --> 02:01:39.195]  I agree with you, but they're going to not
[02:02:00.982 --> 02:02:02.582]  Stand by and just let Trump in.
[02:02:02.602 --> 02:02:14.145]  Did you hear me read that article where a top former CIA operative that's a political science professor at Georgetown University, Dr. John Gentry, is saying he already sees the deep state trying to steal the election right now?
[02:02:15.405 --> 02:02:15.845]  Yes, sir.
[02:02:15.945 --> 02:02:17.906]  And that's why we have InfoWars.
[02:02:18.406 --> 02:02:24.167]  With you and the crew up, we will call out every time they try to do something down to the hour.
[02:02:24.567 --> 02:02:25.327]  We'll call it out.
[02:02:25.827 --> 02:02:28.028]  Everybody else, the independent media picks it up.
[02:02:28.413 --> 02:02:31.736]  They are going to have such a hard time trying to pull off these false flags.
[02:02:31.836 --> 02:02:44.268]  We have got an army of Sherlock Holmeses out there who are all online, so unless they try to... No, you're right, you're right, and that's key that we have X, because they had total control except for Rumble, InfoWars...
[02:02:44.989 --> 02:02:45.169]  Sit well.
[02:03:05.367 --> 02:03:06.047]  Absolutely.
[02:03:06.107 --> 02:03:12.611]  We got so many eyes and telephones out there, and as soon as something happens, it gets reported, people start picking it apart.
[02:03:12.952 --> 02:03:17.314]  And these guys running the show right now, let's face it, they're not the brightest tools in the shed.
[02:03:17.714 --> 02:03:19.496]  And pulling off a false flag ain't easy.
[02:03:19.976 --> 02:03:21.317]  I've seen them trying to do it.
[02:03:21.357 --> 02:03:30.042]  We had explosions in New York last night, and we're having little things go off, but they're not getting big, because I think these guys are incompetent, and also because we're onto them.
[02:03:31.496 --> 02:03:34.639]  Can you believe they launched balloons with big bags that looks like a sand?
[02:03:34.659 --> 02:03:39.043]  I mean, those are weapons to knock airplanes out of the sky and the media just spun it like it was no big deal?
[02:03:40.325 --> 02:03:45.349]  Yeah, and people are on to that too, seeing that the media, that they lie by omission.
[02:03:45.810 --> 02:03:49.754]  You know, we see all these incredible events happening and they just act like, no big deal.
[02:03:50.114 --> 02:03:54.698]  Oh, let's look at, you know, Trump's maids, brothers, cousins, friends, tax returns.
[02:03:55.199 --> 02:03:56.280]  People are on to them.
[02:03:56.824 --> 02:03:58.465]  They're not able to fool us anymore.
[02:03:58.485 --> 02:03:59.846]  Well, let's expand on that, though.
[02:04:00.246 --> 02:04:05.690]  Blocking all these highways and airports all over Europe and the US is probing to destabilize things.
[02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:12.314]  And if the West strikes Iran, they're going to activate Hezbollah inside this country, and all hell's going to break loose.
[02:04:13.855 --> 02:04:16.236]  I mean, they may do that, but what do they have to gain?
[02:04:16.296 --> 02:04:20.099]  I mean, I'm just feeling like all the governments, whether it's Iran, Israel,
[02:04:20.735 --> 02:04:20.995]  I think
[02:04:38.839 --> 02:04:44.642]  I hear you, but that's even more dangerous in a way.
[02:04:44.663 --> 02:04:45.563]  I agree with you.
[02:04:45.583 --> 02:04:48.345]  They're getting very incompetent because now they've been exposed.
[02:04:48.365 --> 02:04:49.765]  They're not operating in darkness.
[02:04:50.366 --> 02:04:51.446]  It's now a confrontation.
[02:04:51.466 --> 02:04:52.047]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:52.067 --> 02:04:52.447]  Stay with us.

[02:06:03.254 --> 02:06:18.885]  The Globalist's worst nightmare and the Patriot's best friend, Alex Jones.
[02:06:19.706 --> 02:06:28.412]  We're taking your calls in the order that they are received.
[02:06:28.432 --> 02:06:31.915]  I love the listeners taking us in a lot of different directions and angles.
[02:06:33.163 --> 02:06:37.686]  I've got a bunch of other news I haven't hit yet that I'm going to be getting into as well.
[02:06:37.766 --> 02:06:41.349]  We're sitting here waiting for the Jeffrey Epstein client list to drop.
[02:06:42.510 --> 02:06:47.453]  It might drop during Owen's show, The War Room, 3 p.m., or it might be tomorrow, it might be next week.
[02:06:47.913 --> 02:06:49.294]  But we already know who flew to the island.
[02:06:49.314 --> 02:06:50.475]  We already know what was going on.
[02:06:50.495 --> 02:06:54.598]  A Mossad, MI6, CIA blackmail operation.
[02:06:56.739 --> 02:06:58.200]  Kevin in Indiana, you're on the air.
[02:06:58.240 --> 02:06:58.801]  Thanks for holding.
[02:06:59.141 --> 02:07:00.082]  Or Bevin, I'm sorry.
[02:07:00.602 --> 02:07:01.643]  Bevin in Indiana, go ahead.
[02:07:02.677 --> 02:07:07.640]  Hey Alex, grateful to be speaking with you right now.
[02:07:07.880 --> 02:07:08.140]  Thank you.
[02:07:08.261 --> 02:07:14.545]  I'm 25 years old and I'm in Gen Z. And the way I see things is I believe my generation currently is completely gone.
[02:07:15.345 --> 02:07:29.414]  And where I'm at right now is I'm at a point to where I see it's our job and it's our duty to stand up and come together as the people to truly save the next generation of children because of all the propaganda that they have being pushed on them.
[02:07:29.494 --> 02:07:30.935]  I believe it's our job to protect them.
[02:07:31.505 --> 02:07:41.253]  But with the election, I also think they're going to try and pull something with the illegal immigrants to maybe do something crazy and have them fight against this.
[02:07:41.313 --> 02:07:46.117]  I don't know where you stand on that, but I'm just, they're going to weaponize the election some way, somehow.
[02:07:46.137 --> 02:07:52.703]  Well, they're already doing it with Black Lives Matter again, with all these cities giving them money, claiming they were abused with no evidence.
[02:07:53.143 --> 02:07:56.286]  They were actually given a red carpet to rampage and burn and kill and loot.
[02:07:57.382 --> 02:08:04.944]  Right, and I just think people need to actually wake up and realize that nothing's going to happen if we don't come together and stand up and do something about it.
[02:08:28.295 --> 02:08:30.518]  It's like impossible for me to live on my own.
[02:08:30.558 --> 02:08:31.720]  I cannot live on my own.
[02:08:31.900 --> 02:08:33.442]  It's physically impossible.
[02:08:45.233 --> 02:08:50.334]  Well, I'm on a bankruptcy budget and it's still more than what most people are paying because I have a lot of functions that have to be paid.
[02:08:50.354 --> 02:08:51.114]  The court knows that.
[02:08:51.454 --> 02:08:54.355]  I mean, I have to like say, hey, let's stop eating out.
[02:08:54.695 --> 02:08:57.655]  And then I do a lot of the shopping and I'm, I mean, it's exploded.
[02:08:57.755 --> 02:08:59.636]  It's, it's absolutely insane.
[02:09:00.456 --> 02:09:03.856]  I go to the grocery store and get like two bags of groceries and it's 150 bucks.
[02:09:04.797 --> 02:09:05.357]  Exactly.
[02:09:06.457 --> 02:09:06.877]  Exactly.
[02:09:06.917 --> 02:09:08.637]  And rent and everything else going into it.
[02:09:08.677 --> 02:09:09.717]  There's just no way to live.
[02:09:09.757 --> 02:09:12.598]  Like I have to be living with four people at least just to get by.
[02:09:13.595 --> 02:09:15.135]  Brother, God bless you, thanks for the call.
[02:09:15.155 --> 02:09:17.136]  Let's talk to Allen in North Carolina.
[02:09:17.236 --> 02:09:17.796]  Allen, welcome.
[02:09:19.276 --> 02:09:26.018]  Hey Alex, I'm going to bring up the point that mass mail-in ballots are the key to this whole thing.
[02:09:26.698 --> 02:09:31.959]  And I've been telling people that... And that's why they want to bring the COVID scare with the new virus back in.
[02:09:32.099 --> 02:09:35.540]  Have you noticed the blue cities and states are putting all the controls back in?
[02:09:36.601 --> 02:09:39.041]  Right, but I don't think they're dumb enough to pull that again so soon.
[02:09:39.661 --> 02:09:42.562]  And I've been telling people that I think that there's going to be like a black swan
[02:09:43.268 --> 02:09:44.690]  All right.
[02:09:54.426 --> 02:09:55.367]  I totally agree.
[02:10:14.042 --> 02:10:15.523]  I think they're definitely setting the stage.
[02:10:15.583 --> 02:10:16.203]  That's for sure.
[02:10:16.223 --> 02:10:17.903]  It's going to be hard to do.
[02:10:17.963 --> 02:10:19.104]  It's going to be very hard to do.
[02:10:46.075 --> 02:10:46.515]  Good points.
[02:10:46.575 --> 02:10:48.316]  I'm glad you raised the point about oil.
[02:10:48.376 --> 02:10:50.496]  That would be a way to totally shut things down as well.
[02:10:52.037 --> 02:10:53.017]  Thank you for your time, Alex.
[02:10:53.137 --> 02:10:53.617]  Yeah, girl.
[02:10:54.138 --> 02:10:54.558]  Thank you.
[02:10:55.198 --> 02:10:55.558]  All right.
[02:10:55.578 --> 02:10:56.418]  Appreciate you calling.
[02:10:56.959 --> 02:10:58.359]  Let's talk to Robert in Florida.
[02:10:58.379 --> 02:10:59.099]  Robert, you're on the air.
[02:10:59.119 --> 02:11:01.640]  Can you hear me okay, Alex?
[02:11:01.700 --> 02:11:02.000]  I can.
[02:11:03.621 --> 02:11:05.421]  Lord give us and the Lord take it away.
[02:11:05.501 --> 02:11:06.842]  Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[02:11:08.182 --> 02:11:09.002]  Two quick points.
[02:11:09.082 --> 02:11:14.024]  First one, what do you recommend for anxiety and depression based off stuff that you guys have, your supplements?
[02:11:16.069 --> 02:11:23.414]  Well, I'm not a doctor, and so I don't sit there and make diagnoses, plus I don't do it over the air.
[02:11:24.234 --> 02:11:31.099]  I know that if you have deficiencies of anything, that can lead to low energy and lethargy.
[02:11:31.159 --> 02:11:34.101]  And so there are a bunch of vitamins and a bunch of minerals and a bunch of trace things
[02:11:34.741 --> 02:11:35.061]  Thank you.
[02:12:02.938 --> 02:12:04.360]  Thanks for watching!
[02:12:18.784 --> 02:12:18.964]  And I
[02:12:49.825 --> 02:12:51.546]  Your gut doesn't absorb as much.
[02:12:51.646 --> 02:12:53.547]  So you may be getting a bunch of sugar and stuff.
[02:12:53.607 --> 02:12:54.567]  That just gives you fat.
[02:12:54.908 --> 02:12:57.249]  Just because you're fat doesn't mean you're getting all the vitamins and minerals you need.
[02:12:57.449 --> 02:12:58.810]  My dad's not fat, by the way.
[02:12:58.870 --> 02:13:00.051]  He's a lot lighter weight than I am.
[02:13:00.611 --> 02:13:06.955]  But just because somebody has weight on their bones doesn't mean they're getting all the nutrients they need because, you know, crap, you know, cotton candy will make you fat.
[02:13:08.015 --> 02:13:10.156]  But it won't give you vitamins and nutrients.
[02:13:10.196 --> 02:13:15.720]  And so they put him also on some prescription souped-up vitamins.
[02:13:16.995 --> 02:13:17.656]  I don't know.
[02:13:34.375 --> 02:13:35.596]  I mean, I think it's mental.
[02:13:35.896 --> 02:13:41.418]  I would pray, I would ask God to energize you, but again, are you hiking in the woods?
[02:13:42.018 --> 02:13:42.619]  Are you hunting?
[02:13:43.479 --> 02:13:46.640]  Are you going for a walk at night under the stars?
[02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:47.801]  How much are you exercising?
[02:13:49.721 --> 02:13:52.123]  Well, not for me generally, for my wife.
[02:13:52.243 --> 02:14:01.827]  I think with a lot of what's going on in the world, my wife has anxiety issues, but she allows things to get to her so easily, and I've noticed magnesium
[02:14:03.191 --> 02:14:05.552]  Like there's some gummies you can buy at Sam's or Costco.
[02:14:06.052 --> 02:14:07.452]  Oh, magnesium powder.
[02:14:08.152 --> 02:14:10.573]  Won't make you sleepy during the day, but at night makes you sleep so good.
[02:14:10.973 --> 02:14:13.073]  Yeah, a lot of people are deficient in magnesium.
[02:14:13.213 --> 02:14:14.114]  You're absolutely right.
[02:14:14.134 --> 02:14:14.714]  That works great.
[02:14:16.454 --> 02:14:19.555]  So my next question, what is your favorite caliber?
[02:14:21.495 --> 02:14:23.256]  You know, that's a really good question.
[02:14:23.276 --> 02:14:27.317]  I like .301 mag.
[02:14:29.656 --> 02:14:51.015]  I mean, if I could only have one gun, like for survival or whatever, and only had so much ammunition, there's a lot of those good survival guns, over-unders, where you've got like a 12-gauge shotgun on the bottom, and then something like a Creedmoor round or a .243 or .308 on the top.
[02:14:54.849 --> 02:15:03.587]  Because then if you were in the bush and all you had was like two boxes of ammo for let's say six months you could survive with
[02:15:05.450 --> 02:15:05.810]  Easily.
[02:15:06.311 --> 02:15:12.355]  With 40 cartridges of .308 and, you know, 20 12-gauge shotgun rounds.
[02:15:13.096 --> 02:15:14.957]  Both for protection and for game and everything.
[02:15:15.658 --> 02:15:18.520]  And so, I had one of those.
[02:15:18.540 --> 02:15:24.204]  It was a .410 on the bottom and a .223 on the top.
[02:15:24.885 --> 02:15:28.287]  And man, I could, like, shoot a Tweety Bird at 100 yards right in the head with it.
[02:15:29.028 --> 02:15:30.109]  With the little .223 on it.
[02:15:31.950 --> 02:15:32.291]  I like 308.
[02:15:32.331 --> 02:15:34.632]  I have a 6.5 Creedmoor, but I just purchased a Ruger Precision 308.
[02:15:34.692 --> 02:15:38.295]  I'm going to go out and reach and touch something here this weekend, so we'll see what we can do.
[02:15:38.355 --> 02:15:42.799]  My next point is there's a new vaccine that they're promoting on TV now called
[02:16:01.688 --> 02:16:03.190]  We're good to go.
[02:16:18.447 --> 02:16:23.692]  Well, I mean, I can tell you what's causing the depression.
[02:16:24.293 --> 02:16:31.439]  When you get on an iPhone or a screen, your brain only has so many decisions you can make in a day before it kind of goes into hibernation mode or daydreaming mode.
[02:16:31.960 --> 02:16:38.206]  And people are, endless text messages, endless, you know, I have friends and family that will have like 20 text messages about meeting in a movie theater.
[02:16:38.706 --> 02:16:43.289]  Just call them up on the phone and say, hey yeah, it starts at 5.30, I bought you tickets, here's where it's at, and be done.
[02:16:43.309 --> 02:16:44.810]  If they're not there, don't be there.
[02:16:44.830 --> 02:17:00.342]  Just constant communication, constantly this and that, and then by the time three or four rolls around, your brain is totally exhausted, and your brain's trained that things are so easy on a phone, it likes those quick, easy decisions, and then starts hating everything else around it that's more complex and real.
[02:17:01.122 --> 02:17:01.842]  But yes, you're right.
[02:17:02.083 --> 02:17:08.665]  On the sides of buses and on billboards for three years, oh, heart attacks are now completely normal.
[02:17:08.685 --> 02:17:09.366]  Strokes are normal.
[02:17:09.406 --> 02:17:10.286]  Blood clots are normal.
[02:17:10.746 --> 02:17:13.067]  They knew right when they rolled the shot out they were going to do it.
[02:17:13.107 --> 02:17:14.648]  Now they have TV ads all over the world.
[02:17:15.068 --> 02:17:16.409]  Oh, now little kids have heart attacks.
[02:17:16.489 --> 02:17:17.269]  It's totally normal.
[02:17:17.729 --> 02:17:20.290]  And now they admit all this is happening.
[02:17:20.330 --> 02:17:21.031]  Now they're spinning it.
[02:17:21.171 --> 02:17:23.852]  Oh, the new variant's going to cause the heart attacks.
[02:17:24.332 --> 02:17:26.473]  There's an epidemic of heart attacks by a new variant.
[02:17:26.533 --> 02:17:34.938]  No, there's been an epidemic from the damn shots that make your body create a spike protein that infects the heart and causes an artificial form of myocarditis.
[02:17:35.218 --> 02:17:36.358]  Viral infection in the heart.
[02:17:36.639 --> 02:17:36.939]  Go ahead.
[02:17:37.959 --> 02:17:39.820]  Well said, well said.
[02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:43.462]  The last thing I'd like to see, if you can play it, I don't know if you can.
[02:17:44.123 --> 02:17:46.424]  Creed, are you ready?
[02:17:46.684 --> 02:17:48.005]  Play it at 2 minutes and 14 seconds.
[02:17:49.358 --> 02:17:53.241]  It's no longer Happy New Year, it's Prepare for the New Year.
[02:17:53.581 --> 02:17:55.703]  So the song is Creed what?
[02:17:56.804 --> 02:17:58.005]  We are Are You Ready?
[02:17:58.025 --> 02:18:01.127]  And then you want us to play it from 2 minutes what?
[02:18:01.147 --> 02:18:04.570]  2 minutes and 14 seconds around there.
[02:18:04.590 --> 02:18:07.372]  Goes into it, you don't have to play the whole thing, it's just a brief.
[02:18:07.492 --> 02:18:10.495]  Alright, we'll see if we can pull that up.
[02:18:10.815 --> 02:18:13.757]  But hey, God bless your father and your family, I'm glad that they're doing better.
[02:18:13.957 --> 02:18:15.679]  God bless everybody, you guys, your crew.
[02:18:16.348 --> 02:18:17.548]  Thank you for all you do, man.
[02:18:17.588 --> 02:18:24.031]  I don't know how you do it every day, but I'm thankful that you are there to spread the message, because you won't be up in 2013.
[02:18:24.091 --> 02:18:25.771]  Well, brother, I appreciate you.
[02:18:25.791 --> 02:18:26.392]  Thank you, Robert.
[02:18:27.492 --> 02:18:28.512]  I want to explain something here.
[02:18:29.313 --> 02:18:30.173]  I'm under attack.
[02:18:31.013 --> 02:18:37.195]  It's like a... I'm driving a tractor and it comes over on me like the thing that killed the traffic camp, the congressman.
[02:18:38.156 --> 02:18:40.256]  And I can't get it off of me.
[02:18:40.296 --> 02:18:42.757]  I need your help for us to collectively get it off each other.
[02:18:43.097 --> 02:18:44.298]  We're all under a tractor.
[02:18:45.143 --> 02:18:46.684]  And we have to work together to get it off of us.
[02:18:46.764 --> 02:18:48.146]  I mean, it's really that simple.
[02:18:48.786 --> 02:18:52.189]  Or it's like a child's pinned under a weight and one man can't pick it up, but five or six could.
[02:18:52.209 --> 02:18:54.371]  I mean, they are attacking us.
[02:18:54.791 --> 02:18:55.531]  They are attacking me.
[02:18:55.571 --> 02:18:57.253]  People ask, where's the energy come from?
[02:18:57.553 --> 02:18:58.274]  How do you do it?
[02:18:58.334 --> 02:18:59.495]  Why are you so focused?
[02:18:59.535 --> 02:19:00.556]  Why are you so upset?
[02:19:00.576 --> 02:19:05.800]  Well, I mean, they've killed conservatively 17 million people.
[02:19:08.042 --> 02:19:10.343]  Any minute now, it'll be up on X. I asked them to post it.
[02:19:11.840 --> 02:19:15.081]  John Bowne's latest report on the Globalist Black Swantel.
[02:19:16.802 --> 02:19:18.843]  The Globalist 2024 Black Swantel.
[02:19:20.243 --> 02:19:22.884]  Or the Globalist tell you what they're going to do in 2024 and it's not nice.
[02:19:23.784 --> 02:19:24.385]  Watch it!
[02:19:24.585 --> 02:19:26.205]  It's 9 minutes and 50 seconds long.
[02:19:27.786 --> 02:19:28.306]  Watch it!
[02:19:29.387 --> 02:19:31.087]  Share it!
[02:19:32.548 --> 02:19:34.208]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, there it is.
[02:19:34.248 --> 02:19:36.829]  The New World Order's 2024 Black Swantel.
[02:19:37.390 --> 02:19:38.130]  Exclusive report.
[02:19:39.451 --> 02:19:41.552]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's such an important report.
[02:19:41.792 --> 02:19:43.793]  When I saw it this morning, I was stunned how good it was.
[02:19:43.853 --> 02:19:45.554]  Jon Bowden's a great researcher, great editor.
[02:19:45.914 --> 02:19:47.114]  So are the rest of the crew.
[02:19:47.934 --> 02:19:57.558]  And again, if I lived in the forest, let's say in Washington State, there were 50 mile an hour winds, there'd been a drought.
[02:19:58.439 --> 02:20:02.741]  And I hear on the radio, the Forest Service says in these neighborhoods, evacuate.
[02:20:03.281 --> 02:20:05.922]  The fire will be in your area within two hours.
[02:20:05.982 --> 02:20:08.383]  I'm going to load up my family and the animals.
[02:20:11.286 --> 02:20:17.069]  And the heirlooms, and the guns, and I'm going to throw them in the car.
[02:20:17.129 --> 02:20:23.192]  And if that didn't get it done in time, and the smoke starts hitting us, and the flames are a half mile away, I'm going to leave all the stuff behind.
[02:20:25.773 --> 02:20:30.536]  And if people then said, oh, you're a hero, I'm a hero?
[02:20:32.861 --> 02:20:34.262]  They just killed 17 million people.
[02:20:34.462 --> 02:20:37.724]  People email me and call me, thank you for saving so many lives and exposing the shot.
[02:20:38.244 --> 02:20:39.544]  Thank you for caring so much.
[02:20:39.624 --> 02:20:40.605]  Caring so much?
[02:20:41.065 --> 02:20:43.206]  They just sabotaged our whole military with the damn thing.
[02:20:43.506 --> 02:20:45.347]  Recruiting's down to 30% of what it used to be.
[02:20:45.708 --> 02:20:46.468]  It's down 70%.
[02:20:48.849 --> 02:20:51.851]  I have empathy, folks, because they want to get me too.
[02:20:53.011 --> 02:20:55.853]  So, it's like, you hear about your neighbor getting robbed.
[02:20:56.053 --> 02:20:57.654]  You have empathy because you like your neighbor.
[02:20:58.803 --> 02:21:02.226]  But you also hear the thieves broke in, you know, at 2 p.m.
[02:21:02.246 --> 02:21:04.428]  when they're at work and stole everything.
[02:21:05.308 --> 02:21:07.290]  You get pissed because that means you're next.
[02:21:11.253 --> 02:21:19.140]  And so many people in this modern sociopathic society, when you're nice to them, and when you try to do good things for them, they think, what's going on?
[02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:20.081]  Why do you need me?
[02:21:20.141 --> 02:21:21.142]  Why are you being nice to me?
[02:21:22.517 --> 02:21:24.038]  Well, I need you for civilization.
[02:21:24.139 --> 02:21:25.500]  I need you for my children to live with.
[02:21:25.820 --> 02:21:28.483]  I need your children to do well, because I want my children to do well.
[02:21:28.783 --> 02:21:31.466]  But these globalists think if they hurt people, they're insulated from it.
[02:21:31.826 --> 02:21:34.429]  And they've been somewhat with their money and their power, but they're not insulated.
[02:21:34.749 --> 02:21:35.570]  I look at the globalists.
[02:21:35.650 --> 02:21:38.753]  I look at these different globalist families.
[02:21:39.193 --> 02:21:41.475]  They have the highest transgenderism in their families.
[02:21:42.677 --> 02:21:46.540]  They have the highest levels of suicide in their families.
[02:21:47.575 --> 02:21:56.140]  Uh, they are the most unhappy people you have ever seen, ladies and gentlemen, and they are in a hell.
[02:21:58.301 --> 02:22:02.604]  And then they project their own self-loathing and their own hatred
[02:22:05.734 --> 02:22:07.055]  of themselves onto us.
[02:22:07.196 --> 02:22:12.381]  So, yeah, I don't like the UN having a world treaty that's going to force control over our bodies.
[02:22:12.561 --> 02:22:16.005]  I don't like them defunding police and then telling the criminal gangs to run wild.
[02:22:16.585 --> 02:22:17.486]  Because I know where it leads.
[02:22:17.506 --> 02:22:18.447]  They're destabilizing things.
[02:22:18.727 --> 02:22:20.549]  I don't like 100 plus thousand fentanyl deaths.
[02:22:20.609 --> 02:22:21.330]  I want it shut down.
[02:22:21.570 --> 02:22:22.111]  And I'm sad.
[02:22:22.131 --> 02:22:25.755]  People I know's kids have died and families have died, but I'm worried about my children.
[02:22:28.902 --> 02:22:36.368]  Because I know that, hey, El Salvador, most dangerous country in the world until two and a half years ago, the government turned off a crime like that.
[02:22:37.489 --> 02:22:38.510]  These governments can do this.
[02:22:38.530 --> 02:22:45.596]  You can tell people to be straight and be strong and be competitive and stand together, and almost any culture can get... But if you've got... I mean, look at North Korea.
[02:22:46.036 --> 02:22:48.578]  Worst country in the world for oppression and tyranny.
[02:22:49.539 --> 02:22:50.419]  Poorest country in the world.
[02:22:50.740 --> 02:22:55.824]  Just south of it, per capita, the richest, most productive country in the world.
[02:22:57.110 --> 02:22:59.291]  Because one's communist and one's quasi-free.
[02:22:59.832 --> 02:23:04.174]  Now the Koreans follow orders, on average, like the Germans do.
[02:23:04.875 --> 02:23:06.235]  Great people, but they do it.
[02:23:06.416 --> 02:23:07.916]  They have the highest level of autism.
[02:23:07.936 --> 02:23:09.257]  It's like 1 in 5 now.
[02:23:10.618 --> 02:23:13.320]  It's like 1 in 34 in the U.S.
[02:23:13.820 --> 02:23:16.682]  Because they line up and take every damn shot they're told to take.
[02:23:17.462 --> 02:23:18.262]  And they are poisoned.
[02:23:18.943 --> 02:23:21.304]  So, you know, there's issues.
[02:23:21.344 --> 02:23:22.125]  Now take the Japanese.
[02:23:22.165 --> 02:23:23.946]  They usually follow government orders, except
[02:23:25.270 --> 02:23:29.337]  When they do their own research and they have the lowest intake of shots, period.
[02:23:29.377 --> 02:23:31.941]  Because the Japanese know, you take a shot, you get sick.
[02:23:32.803 --> 02:23:35.527]  The Japanese family gives their kid a shot and they get sick, they never take them again.
[02:23:35.708 --> 02:23:36.549]  Because they know.
[02:23:36.850 --> 02:23:39.174]  Like you eat a fish and get sick, don't eat that kind of fish again.
[02:23:40.779 --> 02:23:43.322]  They don't need a medical degree to know and see the damn cause and effect.
[02:23:43.342 --> 02:23:49.628]  It's like, I don't need to be a pathologist, again, if I see somebody shove a shotgun in their mouth and blow the back of their head off, that they're dead.
[02:23:50.249 --> 02:23:55.134]  They fall over, they flop around, they bleed out, blood stops coming out of their head, they're dead.
[02:23:55.494 --> 02:24:00.559]  I don't need to have a medical degree, I don't need to be a coroner, or a medical examiner, or a pathologist.
[02:24:02.561 --> 02:24:04.043]  It's like if I got pissed at somebody,
[02:24:05.390 --> 02:24:08.752]  And grabbed their head, and turned it all the way around.
[02:24:09.592 --> 02:24:10.513]  That's not just in movies.
[02:24:10.533 --> 02:24:15.755]  You get pissed at somebody, it's easy to grab them by the head, and... You know what?
[02:24:15.835 --> 02:24:18.257]  I don't need to be a doctor to know I just broke your neck.
[02:24:21.699 --> 02:24:22.179]  You understand?
[02:24:24.640 --> 02:24:26.541]  So, I know what they're doing.
[02:24:26.761 --> 02:24:28.002]  I know what's going down.
[02:24:29.823 --> 02:24:33.645]  And I knowingly have taken on these people, because it's much worse not to.
[02:24:35.629 --> 02:24:37.850]  So now they've tried to assassinate my name.
[02:24:38.791 --> 02:24:40.151]  They've tried to destroy me financially.
[02:24:40.492 --> 02:24:48.656]  And they thought their own caricature, that they created the show Homeland, that was based on me, that all I cared about was money, and I'd turn and run when they took money away.
[02:24:49.076 --> 02:24:58.241]  No, I'd turn and fought, fought, fought, fought, fought, because I don't give a damn about money, except it puts gas in the car and pays for medical care and gets us good food to eat.
[02:24:58.441 --> 02:25:00.142]  But once I got my hierarchy and ease,
[02:25:01.417 --> 02:25:07.979]  Taking care of, you can't get me to sell out just so I can go on a red carpet or hang out with Hollywood.
[02:25:08.019 --> 02:25:08.899]  That's all collapse.
[02:25:08.939 --> 02:25:09.719]  That's all a joke.
[02:25:10.480 --> 02:25:15.021]  And you notice those of us fighting the tyranny are now the most popular, biggest thing there is.
[02:25:15.381 --> 02:25:17.481]  Elon Musk, Joe Rogan, Alex Jones.
[02:25:18.342 --> 02:25:22.503]  I didn't start doing this 29 years ago, 30 years in April to be famous.
[02:25:23.563 --> 02:25:29.905]  I did it because I read the globalist documents from 30, 40 years before and saw they'd gotten done almost all of it.
[02:25:31.653 --> 02:25:33.554]  And then I said, well now they're going to try the next leg.
[02:25:33.594 --> 02:25:36.515]  And I warned people for 29 years, and they've gotten all of that done.
[02:25:37.035 --> 02:25:38.576]  And now they're compressing it.
[02:25:38.616 --> 02:25:39.517]  Now we're in the endgame.
[02:25:39.557 --> 02:25:40.477]  Now it's accelerating.
[02:25:40.697 --> 02:25:42.518]  And do you really want the rest of it to go down?
[02:25:42.538 --> 02:25:44.199]  Because they just beta tested.
[02:25:44.399 --> 02:25:45.379]  They tested the perch.
[02:25:45.579 --> 02:25:48.561]  Like a parrot will check a branch to see if it's heavy enough for it to sit on.
[02:25:50.221 --> 02:25:51.282]  This was just a beta test.
[02:25:51.522 --> 02:25:52.062]  20 million dead.
[02:25:52.763 --> 02:25:53.503]  17 million conservatively.
[02:25:55.103 --> 02:25:59.304]  You think they just killed 17 plus million people and you think you're safe?
[02:25:59.724 --> 02:26:15.949]  I don't care if you're the FBI, or a government lawyer, or a federal judge, or a barber, or a firefighter, or a school teacher, or a psychologist, or a farmer, or a rancher, or a pipe fitter, or an auto mechanic, or an 18-wheeler driver.
[02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:19.790]  I don't care if you're a topless dancer.
[02:26:20.690 --> 02:26:22.151]  I don't care if you run a mini mart.
[02:26:23.314 --> 02:26:24.815]  I don't care if you run a shoe store!
[02:26:25.695 --> 02:26:27.816]  I don't care if you work at an old folks home!
[02:26:28.317 --> 02:26:29.317]  Nobody's safe!
[02:26:29.557 --> 02:26:33.720]  I don't care if you're David Rockefeller, or Zbigniew Brzezinski, they're already dead, or Henry Kissinger.
[02:26:34.520 --> 02:26:38.902]  None of you are safe from God and the expiration date he put on all of us to face judgment.
[02:26:40.283 --> 02:26:42.184]  Obama's not above his crimes.
[02:26:43.245 --> 02:26:44.585]  Bill Clinton's not above his crimes.
[02:26:44.685 --> 02:26:46.586]  King Charles isn't above his crimes.
[02:26:46.606 --> 02:26:49.148]  They're not above anything!
[02:26:51.510 --> 02:26:54.114]  Alright, I'm going to rampage through calls and cover news when we come back.
[02:26:54.154 --> 02:26:55.215]  We're a few minutes out from break.
[02:26:55.236 --> 02:26:55.896]  Please remember...
[02:26:58.430 --> 02:27:00.192]  Has our information not changed the world?
[02:27:00.232 --> 02:27:01.133]  Has it not delivered?
[02:27:01.453 --> 02:27:07.198]  I'm talking to the majority of you that never ordered a t-shirt or a book or a film or a supplement in your life.
[02:27:07.699 --> 02:27:10.901]  I'm on with Elon Musk a few weeks ago for two and a half hours where we interviewed each other.
[02:27:11.562 --> 02:27:14.965]  And he said, I don't know what you call it when you're anti-destroy humanity and depopulation.
[02:27:16.246 --> 02:27:17.908]  And I said, we should call it team humanity.
[02:27:17.928 --> 02:27:18.749]  He said, I like that.
[02:27:18.789 --> 02:27:19.770]  Let's call it team humanity.
[02:27:19.930 --> 02:27:22.892]  I just got Elon Musk and he's now starting to use that term.
[02:27:23.763 --> 02:27:24.744]  It's not about the sports team.
[02:27:24.764 --> 02:27:26.024]  It's not about all those distractions.
[02:27:26.045 --> 02:27:27.706]  It's about, are you Team Humanity?
[02:27:28.526 --> 02:27:31.228]  Pro-life, pro-human future, or are you pro-death?
[02:27:31.708 --> 02:27:33.189]  It's an image of the nuclear family.
[02:27:33.209 --> 02:27:35.611]  A father, a mother, a little girl, a little boy.
[02:27:36.251 --> 02:27:36.972]  Team Humanity.
[02:27:37.552 --> 02:27:39.593]  InfoWars.com on the front, Team Humanity on the back.
[02:27:39.954 --> 02:27:40.834]  There's two different variants of it.
[02:27:40.854 --> 02:27:42.255]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[02:27:43.816 --> 02:27:45.918]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:27:46.278 --> 02:27:46.758]  Go there.
[02:27:46.898 --> 02:27:48.920]  Get the Team Humanity shirt.
[02:27:49.020 --> 02:27:52.342]  I want this to be a bestseller, and we need it, the funding.
[02:27:53.712 --> 02:27:54.472]  I mean, here's an example.
[02:27:54.532 --> 02:28:00.075]  Super high quality t-shirts that were, you know, soft and nice and good, just two years ago were $10 a piece.
[02:28:01.335 --> 02:28:05.237]  Crappy, real quick ones, you know, I'm like, hey, this shirt we're selling, it costs like six bucks.
[02:28:07.458 --> 02:28:09.018]  Now a quality shirt costs us $15, $16.
[02:28:11.434 --> 02:28:12.674]  And the cheap ones cost us eight.
[02:28:13.135 --> 02:28:15.275]  And you gotta print it costs another dollar or so or more.
[02:28:16.175 --> 02:28:18.976]  So these shirts are costing us like $16 a print because they're quality.
[02:28:19.276 --> 02:28:20.317]  We're selling for $29.
[02:28:20.597 --> 02:28:26.359]  Should we get $15 a year to fund the operation to hold off all their lawsuits and all their garbage?
[02:28:26.479 --> 02:28:27.159]  And we're winning!
[02:28:27.779 --> 02:28:29.159]  But we need funds to win a war.
[02:28:29.320 --> 02:28:31.060]  Get a Team Humanity shirt.
[02:28:31.360 --> 02:28:33.221]  This is the shirt I want to see everybody wear.
[02:28:33.521 --> 02:28:34.281]  Go get it now.
[02:28:36.302 --> 02:28:37.482]  InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:28:37.542 --> 02:28:38.362]  It says Team Humanity.
[02:28:38.382 --> 02:28:38.802]  7076InfoWars.com.
[02:28:42.028 --> 02:28:42.708]  And I designed it.
[02:28:43.029 --> 02:28:43.869]  There's two different variants.
[02:28:43.889 --> 02:28:44.590]  That's the one I designed.
[02:28:44.610 --> 02:28:45.130]  I like it the best.
[02:28:45.150 --> 02:28:45.910]  The other one's great, too.
[02:28:46.151 --> 02:28:47.371]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:28:47.431 --> 02:28:50.693]  Get it and get Turbo Force and get X2 and get Winter Son.
[02:28:51.053 --> 02:28:52.674]  All discounted with free shipping right now.

[02:29:12.319 --> 02:29:16.520]  ...and knows that we're destined to do even more incredible things than we've already done together.
[02:29:16.680 --> 02:29:27.703]  And so, inspired by my conversation with Elon Musk recently, where he agreed with my idea to call it Team Humanity, we've launched two limited edition t-shirts at infowarestore.com.
[02:29:27.963 --> 02:29:31.904]  Let people know that, hey, it isn't about the football games, or it isn't even about the UFC.
[02:29:32.404 --> 02:29:36.465]  It's about Team Humanity being under globalist attack.
[02:29:36.785 --> 02:29:37.105]  You kid.
[02:29:37.825 --> 02:29:46.812]  Wear it, it's a great conversation starter, and you know it's supporting the InfoWar that is at the very tip of the spear in the fight for Team Humanity.
[02:29:47.072 --> 02:29:51.736]  Get your limited edition Team Humanity t-shirts right now at InfoWarStore.com, and I thank you.
[02:29:58.985 --> 02:30:06.128]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large.
[02:30:06.648 --> 02:30:14.430]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep support formula, Down-N-Out, is just the thing.
[02:30:15.211 --> 02:30:21.573]  It's our new, faster-absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[02:30:22.233 --> 02:30:32.146]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling product, Knockout, with Down and Out, now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[02:30:32.666 --> 02:30:37.052]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[02:30:37.492 --> 02:30:41.197]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the Passionflower.
[02:30:41.397 --> 02:30:44.339]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[02:31:02.677 --> 02:31:07.220]  Where were you when the globalists were caught trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[02:31:07.860 --> 02:31:10.782]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?
[02:31:11.322 --> 02:31:12.003]  Well, I know where you are.
[02:31:12.383 --> 02:31:16.366]  You're watching and listening to Infowars.com right now, and I salute you and thank you.
[02:31:16.866 --> 02:31:22.730]  And I want to encourage all of you who've been in this fight so long to realize we've reached the critical juncture in the battle now.
[02:31:23.470 --> 02:31:30.059]  And a key tool in that fight is the Great Awakening, defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[02:31:30.480 --> 02:31:33.684]  This is my second book, part two of The Great Reset and War for the World.
[02:31:34.125 --> 02:31:38.671]  It's a longer book, quite frankly a more powerful book, and just like the last book,
[02:31:38.951 --> 02:31:39.211]  We're good.
[02:31:57.642 --> 02:31:59.063]  Your products have changed my life.
[02:31:59.383 --> 02:32:01.504]  Your brain force and all that make me better.
[02:32:01.544 --> 02:32:02.665]  They make me more focused.
[02:32:02.745 --> 02:32:03.806]  They make me feel better.
[02:32:03.826 --> 02:32:08.128]  A lot of lingering effects from when I was getting sober have now relieved me.
[02:32:08.288 --> 02:32:10.149]  My girlfriend goes to the gym and goes hard.
[02:32:10.209 --> 02:32:10.890]  She's an American.
[02:32:11.050 --> 02:32:11.530]  The same stuff.
[02:32:11.990 --> 02:32:13.511]  These products will change your life.
[02:32:13.991 --> 02:32:18.814]  They find one of the greatest things out there right now for us as free Americans.
[02:32:18.974 --> 02:32:20.335]  Please do these people a favor.
[02:32:20.855 --> 02:32:27.960]  Go to their store, support them, do what you need to do, because if we lose InfoWars, we lose a lot more than what people are willing to believe.
[02:32:52.316 --> 02:32:56.257]  Have a great day.
[02:32:59.118 --> 02:33:05.079]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:11.561 --> 02:33:18.424]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:41.312 --> 02:33:43.776]  You'll fire musket, but I'll run you through!
[02:33:45.659 --> 02:33:48.663]  You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too!
[02:33:48.703 --> 02:33:51.768]  You'll fire musket, but I'll run you through!
[02:33:51.808 --> 02:33:55.734]  So when you're waiting for the next attack, you better stand by!
[02:34:11.647 --> 02:34:13.688]  As we plunge into certain death.
[02:34:14.328 --> 02:34:17.450]  They're already slaughtering our women and children all around us.
[02:34:18.110 --> 02:34:20.511]  They've already killed at least 17 million of us.
[02:34:21.291 --> 02:34:23.692]  That wasn't a mere first bite.
[02:34:27.454 --> 02:34:29.075]  They plan on feasting on us.
[02:34:30.435 --> 02:34:32.096]  Their journey to becoming God.
[02:34:33.517 --> 02:34:36.258]  All they'll do is conjure their own destruction.
[02:34:38.019 --> 02:34:40.180]  Welcome to the end of the New World Order.
[02:34:41.104 --> 02:34:44.948]  It will live but for a short time and then collapse.
[02:35:10.347 --> 02:35:12.408]  Thanks for keeping me on air to fight another day, folks.
[02:35:12.508 --> 02:35:13.848]  All the credit goes to God and you.
[02:35:14.428 --> 02:35:15.048]  None of it to me.
[02:35:15.068 --> 02:35:18.009]  It's all about you.
[02:35:18.509 --> 02:35:19.309]  And never forget it.
[02:35:19.329 --> 02:35:27.232]  Man, I'm 50 next month.
[02:35:28.372 --> 02:35:30.493]  And I got glasses two years ago and that gave me a headache.
[02:35:30.533 --> 02:35:31.433]  But I don't know what I'm gonna do.
[02:35:31.473 --> 02:35:32.753]  I used to have 2015 vision.
[02:35:33.053 --> 02:35:34.874]  I can see ants crawling around the ground at like 20 feet.
[02:35:36.776 --> 02:35:39.037]  And now, I can't read that name.
[02:35:39.097 --> 02:35:39.677]  Is it Rhett?
[02:35:40.437 --> 02:35:41.757]  Alright, man, I gotta get glasses.
[02:35:41.797 --> 02:35:45.878]  I mean, it's like... I gotta wear the damn things, I guess.
[02:35:46.278 --> 02:35:47.658]  Or contacts or something, man.
[02:35:48.179 --> 02:35:50.179]  Alright, let's go ahead.
[02:35:50.199 --> 02:35:51.879]  Rhett and Tennessee are on the air.
[02:35:51.899 --> 02:35:52.359]  Go ahead.
[02:35:52.880 --> 02:35:54.240]  Yeah, what's going on, Alex?
[02:35:54.280 --> 02:35:56.020]  Hey, man, 2024 is the most important year.
[02:35:56.940 --> 02:35:59.701]  Not only for Team Humanity and for the spiritual war we have against
[02:36:00.495 --> 02:36:01.456]  Yeah, I'm fired up.
[02:36:01.476 --> 02:36:01.756]  I'm fired up.
[02:36:01.776 --> 02:36:05.638]  I want to tell you about the utility systems and the vulnerability that we have right here in Tennessee.
[02:36:05.658 --> 02:36:10.400]  I don't need to tell you that Kinder Morgan is one of the largest energy infrastructure companies in the United States.
[02:36:10.420 --> 02:36:14.323]  There was an explosion on August 18, 2023 that wasn't really covered.
[02:36:26.918 --> 02:36:31.160]  On mainstream media, you know, they had a one-mile radius where they had to evacuate.
[02:36:32.681 --> 02:36:36.222]  And so just, you know, things like that are just going to keep on going on this year, I think.
[02:36:36.262 --> 02:36:36.742]  Yeah, I know.
[02:36:36.782 --> 02:36:39.763]  They caught a bunch of leftists doing it, and they spin it that they're right-wingers.
[02:36:40.124 --> 02:36:48.567]  Then the left openly says they're going to attack the power infrastructure, like they're trying to bring down airplanes in New York, launching balloons with big ropes on them with big bags of sand under it.
[02:36:48.587 --> 02:36:49.007]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:36:49.207 --> 02:36:50.088]  Total weapons system.
[02:36:50.128 --> 02:36:51.128]  They're the ones attacking.
[02:36:51.628 --> 02:36:53.629]  They're the ones publicly cutting off the infrastructure.
[02:36:53.649 --> 02:36:55.050]  They're the ones behind the scenes doing it.
[02:36:56.448 --> 02:36:58.691]  Yeah, but they also are blaming it on equipment failure.
[02:36:58.751 --> 02:37:04.017]  So, for example, on August 18th of 2023, like I mentioned, they said it was equipment failure.
[02:37:04.037 --> 02:37:07.661]  It really comes down to people just out of culpability.
[02:37:10.236 --> 02:37:10.816]  Well, that's true.
[02:37:10.896 --> 02:37:15.780]  Civilization is very hard to build, and these companies cut back on staff.
[02:37:16.780 --> 02:37:18.802]  They're nepotistic.
[02:37:19.162 --> 02:37:20.563]  There's a lot of nepotism going on.
[02:37:22.064 --> 02:37:26.747]  Look, nuclear power is great if it's done just right, but almost every reactor is leaking.
[02:37:26.787 --> 02:37:32.231]  They admit there's 460-something worldwide that aren't in submarines or ships.
[02:37:32.772 --> 02:37:36.054]  There's well over another couple hundred after that, but there's less than 1,000 reactors
[02:37:37.995 --> 02:37:42.618]  Power generating reactors, there's a bunch of test ones, small ones, another hundred or so that I know of.
[02:37:42.938 --> 02:37:47.581]  So there's around a thousand reactors worldwide, and these things are managed horribly.
[02:37:48.121 --> 02:37:54.164]  And again, why would the globalists with all the money and control be not managing the nuclear reactors?
[02:37:54.905 --> 02:37:56.486]  Because they're a bunch of inbred scum.
[02:38:01.260 --> 02:38:02.722]  You know, the FDA is not on our team.
[02:38:02.962 --> 02:38:05.745]  The FDA is not on team's mission.
[02:38:05.985 --> 02:38:06.846]  It's not zero.
[02:38:06.866 --> 02:38:08.408]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:38:08.428 --> 02:38:12.773]  The FDA will try to tell you, don't take your vitamin C or vitamin D, but eat the chitin bugs.
[02:38:13.273 --> 02:38:14.275]  On record, it gives you cancer.
[02:38:14.315 --> 02:38:14.915]  Thanks for the call.
[02:38:16.177 --> 02:38:17.218]  Bart in Georgia.
[02:38:17.238 --> 02:38:17.718]  You're on the air.
[02:38:17.738 --> 02:38:18.079]  Go ahead.
[02:38:19.614 --> 02:38:23.955]  Yeah, I want to talk about the broken border, bioweapons, and martial law.
[02:38:24.015 --> 02:38:28.676]  This caravan of illegal aliens is here to steal, kill, and destroy.
[02:38:28.696 --> 02:38:41.879]  I believe that they're going to slip in a bioweapon, something really scary sounding like mousepox or weaponized smallpox, release it in this group, put us into martial law, August, September, October, cancel the election.
[02:38:43.191 --> 02:38:47.195]  Yeah, I mean that's what they've been pre-programming so they don't want to blame their little precious illegal aliens.
[02:38:48.096 --> 02:38:49.557]  So they'll probably say it's some other group.
[02:38:49.577 --> 02:38:51.579]  But no, I've seen countless videos.
[02:38:51.779 --> 02:38:53.120]  Our crews even shot some of them.
[02:38:53.440 --> 02:38:55.202]  I've had the reporters in here that shot the video.
[02:38:55.602 --> 02:38:58.905]  They're literally chanting in Spanish famous communist slogans.
[02:39:00.027 --> 02:39:02.509]  So they've been brainwashing camps for months and months.
[02:39:03.129 --> 02:39:09.035]  They're organizing the caravans as like artillery rounds and fired into the United States with chips on their shoulder.
[02:39:11.425 --> 02:39:14.806]  Yeah, this must be stopped before the election.
[02:39:14.826 --> 02:39:15.886]  We can't wait on Trump.
[02:39:15.906 --> 02:39:16.946]  We've got to do something now.
[02:39:18.547 --> 02:39:21.607]  Well, I've got to say Abbott's done not a very good job of it until now.
[02:39:21.647 --> 02:39:26.348]  He doesn't have a lot of power because it is in the Constitution that the Feds control the border, but in an emergency a governor can do something.
[02:39:26.788 --> 02:39:31.809]  He is starting to arrest them, and they've got laws in the books to do it.
[02:39:31.929 --> 02:39:34.590]  The problem is when they give them to the Feds, they just turn them loose.
[02:39:35.546 --> 02:39:41.590]  And I've talked to off-record federal judges, FBI, Border Patrol, ICE, federal marshals.
[02:39:42.210 --> 02:39:43.851]  And again, that's why I don't say the feds are enemy.
[02:39:44.151 --> 02:39:45.072]  It's an infrastructure.
[02:39:45.092 --> 02:39:46.152]  There's some good, some bad.
[02:39:46.172 --> 02:39:49.534]  It's like an airplane, or a tractor, or a car, or a gun.
[02:39:49.594 --> 02:39:50.015]  It's a tool.
[02:39:50.695 --> 02:39:52.676]  And it's these offices are being misused.
[02:39:52.736 --> 02:39:55.977]  But let me tell you, you've seen the whistleblowers, you've seen the congressional reports.
[02:39:56.537 --> 02:40:00.379]  The vast majority of the Border Patrol is just sick to their stomach.
[02:40:00.499 --> 02:40:06.981]  But more and more you're seeing young ones, because the old ones are retiring, and they're laughing and saying, yeah, it's our job, open border.
[02:40:07.401 --> 02:40:12.443]  So they're more and more converting the Border Patrol to a woke institution, just like our military.
[02:40:12.483 --> 02:40:17.145]  So it's not that the police are bad, it's who controls them and who picks them.
[02:40:17.425 --> 02:40:18.946]  And they're putting bad people in.
[02:40:21.289 --> 02:40:31.572]  Yeah, the final thing I have to say is I put up Alex Jones and everything from Infowars on Rumble and Bitchute and everywhere else, so go to Bart Fine on Rumble and Bitchute and watch the Alex Jones Show, please.
[02:40:32.232 --> 02:40:32.772]  God bless you.
[02:40:33.533 --> 02:40:35.973]  Yeah, can we pull up my ex-account real Alex Jones?
[02:40:36.294 --> 02:40:41.855]  When I said we're getting 10 million views a day, we're getting 10 million views a day on that channel.
[02:40:44.576 --> 02:40:44.976]  Pull it up.
[02:40:46.877 --> 02:40:50.778]  And what's even crazier is people then grab the videos we post
[02:40:51.817 --> 02:40:56.862]  Because people are still trained to not want to share info or they think it's being censored on Twitter or X. It's not.
[02:40:58.163 --> 02:40:59.004]  So start scrolling down.
[02:40:59.044 --> 02:40:59.785]  Show me some of these numbers.
[02:41:00.886 --> 02:41:02.067]  And of course the day's young.
[02:41:02.448 --> 02:41:05.671]  We've still got like 10 hours plus left here.
[02:41:06.011 --> 02:41:06.952]  10 hours 20 minutes left.
[02:41:08.074 --> 02:41:10.736]  And there's multiple videos we put up with millions of views.
[02:41:11.057 --> 02:41:12.938]  But what's crazier is I just checked during the break.
[02:41:13.854 --> 02:41:16.476]  The Epstein video we posted two hours ago has a million views.
[02:41:17.376 --> 02:41:19.978]  A bunch of people copied it, and some of those have over a million.
[02:41:20.398 --> 02:41:20.918]  So I love it.
[02:41:21.659 --> 02:41:23.020]  Take our stuff, repost it.
[02:41:23.800 --> 02:41:25.801]  That is what we are looking for.
[02:41:26.642 --> 02:41:28.163]  And so yeah, look at that.
[02:41:28.183 --> 02:41:28.883]  983,000 on that Epstein video.
[02:41:28.903 --> 02:41:30.464]  And then look at this one.
[02:41:30.484 --> 02:41:31.365]  This one right here is like 800,000.
[02:41:31.405 --> 02:41:31.365]  700,000.
[02:41:34.247 --> 02:41:34.707]  Now click on that.
[02:41:34.727 --> 02:41:35.387]  Scroll back up.
[02:41:36.468 --> 02:41:36.848]  Click on that.
[02:41:43.649 --> 02:41:45.710]  And then go to the actual page for the guy, scroll down.
[02:41:46.110 --> 02:41:51.491]  Notice how it's over a million on his, and then I looked and there's a bunch of new copies with millions of views.
[02:41:51.671 --> 02:41:51.951]  1.3 million.
[02:41:53.232 --> 02:41:55.392]  Which is the same video, it just has more views on that channel.
[02:41:55.952 --> 02:41:57.873]  So, and he keeps scrolling down.
[02:41:58.373 --> 02:42:05.175]  Just since I started posting at 7am this morning, or 6am, we've already got, I counted up during the break, 8 million views.
[02:42:06.479 --> 02:42:07.019]  Conservative one.
[02:42:07.720 --> 02:42:18.304]  And then everybody else is posting it, so I would take hours to figure it out, but today we'll probably hit 30 million people on X. That's pretty good!
[02:42:20.845 --> 02:42:22.466]  Think the New World Order is happy about that?
[02:42:24.206 --> 02:42:26.327]  I don't think they're very, very happy about that.
[02:42:35.325 --> 02:42:40.687]  All right, we're going to come right back, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side of this transmission break.
[02:42:41.848 --> 02:42:44.049]  And we are going to go right back to your phone calls.
[02:42:44.089 --> 02:42:44.969]  I'm going to get to everybody.
[02:42:45.710 --> 02:42:46.210]  Stay with us.
[02:42:46.470 --> 02:42:48.571]  And then Jason Burmas is coming up.
[02:42:48.591 --> 02:42:52.092]  By the way, that mug shot we just showed looks a lot like a skinny Burmas.
[02:42:53.433 --> 02:42:54.353]  He's having some fun.

[02:47:47.691 --> 02:47:49.652]  Tyranny has risen many times.
[02:47:50.993 --> 02:47:52.675]  It always uses the same tactics.
[02:47:54.096 --> 02:47:55.236]  And it will be defeated again.
[02:47:55.256 --> 02:48:00.240]  I'm taking your phone calls right now.
[02:48:01.733 --> 02:48:02.654]  Michael in Kentucky.
[02:48:02.674 --> 02:48:03.775]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:48:05.216 --> 02:48:06.297]  Much love for you, Alex.
[02:48:07.298 --> 02:48:07.778]  Back at you.
[02:48:07.798 --> 02:48:09.660]  Can you hear me?
[02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:10.320]  I can.
[02:48:11.101 --> 02:48:11.541]  All right.
[02:48:11.641 --> 02:48:14.924]  So I want to talk about Epstein a little bit.
[02:48:15.985 --> 02:48:20.169]  However, it's a moot point right now because we're under attack, right?
[02:48:20.229 --> 02:48:24.712]  So the distractions need to fall away and the veil is lifted, like you said.
[02:48:26.094 --> 02:48:28.716]  So I just wanted to, like, throw a little bit of
[02:48:29.651 --> 02:48:31.512]  Kind of a testimony out there and keep it short.
[02:48:33.574 --> 02:48:42.360]  Back in the day, lived in Hollywood, California, went through a bunch of stuff, negative stuff, discovered what that place was all about, born and raised in Southern California.
[02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:49.845]  And it was clear and apparent to see the kind of elements that were there, sucking in children and all of that.
[02:48:50.325 --> 02:48:53.347]  And it almost, it almost sucked in me and my family.
[02:48:54.208 --> 02:49:02.872]  And I mean, I witnessed straight up just Satanism happening, you know, a lot of a lot of spiritual attacks on me personally.
[02:49:03.892 --> 02:49:06.393]  And yeah, I mean, I don't feel weak anywhere.
[02:49:06.413 --> 02:49:09.494]  And I've been a lot of places in the world that have demonic influence.
[02:49:09.534 --> 02:49:18.178]  But I feel as I'm landing in LA as the planes coming in, I feel that like, like there's a satanic force field that's blocking the Holy Spirit.
[02:49:19.156 --> 02:49:26.709]  So at one point, the spirit compelled me while I was living there to map out the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
[02:49:27.592 --> 02:49:32.413]  And in a period of 11 hours, I mean, I was on one without being on drugs.
[02:49:33.253 --> 02:49:38.734]  And I took a picture of every single star on the Walk of Fame in an 11 hour period.
[02:49:39.234 --> 02:49:43.055]  And I noticed that it's a giant open ended cross.
[02:49:43.495 --> 02:49:45.295]  It's kind of like a ley line thing there.
[02:49:45.375 --> 02:49:52.216]  And they got all these like metallurgy and stone elements and all this stuff that concentrates, you know, I guess power.
[02:49:52.936 --> 02:49:55.937]  You know, it's it's a pretty it's a giant ritual.
[02:49:56.744 --> 02:49:57.864]  Yeah, straight up, you know.
[02:49:57.944 --> 02:50:02.726]  So, that, we faced all of that, and, you know, I tried not to turn my back on there.
[02:50:03.106 --> 02:50:05.707]  Jesus Christ pulled me and my family out of that.
[02:50:05.727 --> 02:50:06.867]  No BS about it.
[02:50:06.947 --> 02:50:08.448]  And now it's a complete joke.
[02:50:09.048 --> 02:50:10.028]  The spell is lifted.
[02:50:10.088 --> 02:50:11.288]  The spell is broken.
[02:50:11.749 --> 02:50:13.169]  People know Hollywood's a joke now.
[02:50:14.089 --> 02:50:14.649]  Yeah, man.
[02:50:14.970 --> 02:50:18.311]  And the propaganda machine, you know, it's super easy to see.
[02:50:18.771 --> 02:50:22.312]  So, I guess I'll just leave you with a small prayer, if I may.
[02:50:25.307 --> 02:50:28.550]  Heavenly Father, please continue to protect us during this.
[02:50:29.110 --> 02:50:33.834]  Show us the truth that's being unveiled here and just keep the revelation on full force.
[02:50:34.274 --> 02:50:40.599]  I pray for the spiritual sight and hearing of everybody that's listening and trying to follow a good path to be on fire.
[02:50:40.999 --> 02:50:43.841]  On fire and higher up more than we've ever been before.
[02:50:44.281 --> 02:50:49.385]  The enemy is now backed into a corner and the power that they worship, the Luciferian light,
[02:50:50.106 --> 02:50:52.207]  It's the same as the power of Jesus Christ.
[02:50:52.327 --> 02:50:56.728]  But the thing is, they don't worship the sentience and love of the Lord.
[02:50:57.208 --> 02:50:57.968]  And we know that.
[02:50:58.008 --> 02:50:59.248]  We know you're alive, Lord.
[02:50:59.588 --> 02:51:03.629]  And we're going to break down all strongholds and legal bonds that that enemy has set up.
[02:51:04.150 --> 02:51:05.470]  God's going to break those down.
[02:51:05.490 --> 02:51:05.910]  Amen.
[02:51:06.190 --> 02:51:07.951]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:51:08.451 --> 02:51:09.251]  It's all about God.
[02:51:09.271 --> 02:51:10.431]  God's going to do it, not us.
[02:51:10.871 --> 02:51:11.751]  But we're going to do it.
[02:51:12.732 --> 02:51:13.752]  Christ is going to work through us.
[02:51:13.772 --> 02:51:16.653]  All right, let's talk to Dylan in California.
[02:51:16.673 --> 02:51:17.453]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[02:51:19.144 --> 02:51:19.885]  Hey Alex, can you hear me?
[02:51:20.085 --> 02:51:22.186]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[02:51:22.246 --> 02:51:24.328]  Hey, so let's talk about waking people up in 2024.
[02:51:24.428 --> 02:51:33.154]  And also spiritually, there seems to be a lot of worry that people have, even people who are in Christ.
[02:51:33.174 --> 02:51:37.096]  And I just want to say that those who are in Christ are protected.
[02:51:37.116 --> 02:51:38.317]  We have nothing to worry about.
[02:51:38.738 --> 02:51:40.719]  Our focus should be on waking other people up.
[02:51:41.229 --> 02:51:45.690]  You know, the Bible teaches that if God will even feed the fowl of the air, he will also feed you.
[02:51:45.810 --> 02:51:46.230]  Well, that's right.
[02:51:46.250 --> 02:51:49.711]  When you're in God's plan, if God decides to let something bad happen, it's for the greater good.
[02:51:50.151 --> 02:51:51.671]  Trust God and be at peace.
[02:51:52.472 --> 02:51:56.053]  Don't be in fear of the enemy, but you should also have a drive to oppose the enemy.
[02:51:56.433 --> 02:51:59.513]  But it's not a spirit of fear, but a spirit of overcoming and victory.
[02:52:00.554 --> 02:52:00.954]  Exactly.
[02:52:00.994 --> 02:52:02.474]  Now, let's talk about some truths of next year.
[02:52:02.514 --> 02:52:10.576]  So there's some naivety, too, on the right as well as obviously the left, but they will kill Trump before he's
[02:52:11.235 --> 02:52:11.536]  All right.
[02:52:24.588 --> 02:52:28.951]  They're going to use a civil war, in my opinion, as plan B under the pretext of... No, I agree with you.
[02:52:29.091 --> 02:52:29.972]  All bets are off.
[02:52:30.412 --> 02:52:34.055]  Cyber attacks, massive false flag, race war.
[02:52:34.195 --> 02:52:35.956]  I mean, they got it all heated up and ready.
[02:52:36.557 --> 02:52:38.058]  You can smell it cooking in the kitchen.
[02:52:38.078 --> 02:52:43.682]  You can look, open the door in the kitchen and see they got the whole thing set up and they got waiters about to bring it out.
[02:52:44.763 --> 02:52:45.143]  Exactly.
[02:52:45.183 --> 02:52:51.688]  We have to also understand that the people who disagree with us are not our enemy, but we have to continue waking them up.
[02:52:52.287 --> 02:52:57.191]  Politically, our biggest difference is not even doctrine, it's not policy, it's naivety.
[02:52:57.211 --> 02:52:59.213]  I think you hit it first.
[02:52:59.253 --> 02:53:02.616]  They're actually scared, subconsciously, in the spirit.
[02:53:02.656 --> 02:53:03.357]  They know the truth.
[02:53:03.397 --> 02:53:05.419]  They don't want to admit it because it's too horrifying.
[02:53:05.779 --> 02:53:06.500]  I appreciate your call.
[02:53:06.540 --> 02:53:07.000]  Great points.
[02:53:07.180 --> 02:53:08.421]  We're going to move quick because everybody is here.
[02:53:08.782 --> 02:53:10.323]  Dylan in Colorado, you're on the air.
[02:53:10.343 --> 02:53:10.643]  Welcome.
[02:53:11.804 --> 02:53:12.865]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:53:13.206 --> 02:53:13.446]  Thank you.
[02:53:14.566 --> 02:53:18.148]  Hey, the synchronicity on this show is just unbelievable.
[02:53:18.888 --> 02:53:23.030]  I just wanted to talk about, you know, some of the things that the last people have been saying, too.
[02:53:23.930 --> 02:53:25.851]  You know, I think they're scared.
[02:53:25.891 --> 02:53:26.991]  They're freaked out.
[02:53:27.171 --> 02:53:31.113]  But, you know, what does a child do when it's losing a game?
[02:53:31.933 --> 02:53:34.094]  It flips the game board over.
[02:53:35.074 --> 02:53:36.695]  And I think that's what they're going to do, you know?
[02:53:36.775 --> 02:53:41.777]  I mean, the predictive programming has reached a crescendo.
[02:53:42.338 --> 02:53:46.640]  Between, you know, the Obama's new movie and all the television shows.
[02:53:47.360 --> 02:53:57.003]  And, you know, once a week at least, I see a, you know, a news article come across my news feed about, you know, an X-Class flare or something like that.
[02:53:57.663 --> 02:53:59.544]  And, you know, I think they're going to flip the switch.
[02:53:59.564 --> 02:54:00.504]  They're going to turn off the power.
[02:54:01.745 --> 02:54:03.065]  And say that a solar flare did it.
[02:54:03.125 --> 02:54:04.266]  Yeah, they may not even make it political.
[02:54:04.606 --> 02:54:07.447]  No, they're definitely hyping power outages and cyber outages.
[02:54:08.167 --> 02:54:10.488]  That's their main thing that I see them pre-programming.
[02:54:11.539 --> 02:54:12.379]  Yeah.
[02:54:12.420 --> 02:54:14.200]  And you say, well, why would they tell you the next move?
[02:54:14.481 --> 02:54:16.121]  Because they've always acted like we're asleep.
[02:54:16.622 --> 02:54:18.863]  So they're pre-programming their subconscious to get us ready for it.
[02:54:20.224 --> 02:54:23.425]  And to answer your question about the nuclear power plants, why aren't they taking care of them?
[02:54:23.926 --> 02:54:25.386]  The power goes out for three weeks.
[02:54:25.947 --> 02:54:31.570]  Those power plants have three weeks worth of diesel fuel to run their cooling plants.
[02:54:31.630 --> 02:54:31.990]  That's right.
[02:54:32.170 --> 02:54:33.311]  They melt down.
[02:54:33.551 --> 02:54:35.952]  You think those truckers are going to come and deliver extra?
[02:54:36.704 --> 02:54:38.145]  You know, diesel?
[02:54:38.585 --> 02:54:39.866]  When their families are starving?
[02:54:39.986 --> 02:54:40.386]  I doubt it.
[02:54:40.886 --> 02:54:42.267]  And that's another modernization then.
[02:54:42.287 --> 02:54:44.908]  They've talked about stockpiling diesel for at least six months there.
[02:54:44.928 --> 02:54:45.428]  They don't do it.
[02:54:45.889 --> 02:54:49.771]  Everything is just enough to keep operating, which makes us incredibly weak.
[02:54:50.291 --> 02:54:56.154]  Instead of having more, you scale up economies by having more, by taking care of people, by having new economies.
[02:54:56.434 --> 02:54:59.035]  But no, they're like, oh, no, no, the less humans, the less jobs, the better.
[02:54:59.055 --> 02:54:59.336]  No, no.
[02:54:59.616 --> 02:55:00.416]  That creates crime.
[02:55:00.456 --> 02:55:01.297]  It creates depression.
[02:55:01.637 --> 02:55:03.198]  We need to build a world for humans.
[02:55:03.618 --> 02:55:04.338]  Team humanity.
[02:55:04.438 --> 02:55:04.939]  Great points.
[02:55:04.979 --> 02:55:05.259]  Thank you.
[02:55:06.127 --> 02:55:07.568]  Daniel in Texas, go ahead.
[02:55:09.308 --> 02:55:09.688]  Yeah.
[02:55:11.349 --> 02:55:11.649]  Welcome.
[02:55:12.770 --> 02:55:15.871]  Hey, I can't hear myself, so I didn't know I was on.
[02:55:15.991 --> 02:55:16.491]  It's okay.
[02:55:16.531 --> 02:55:17.191]  Go ahead.
[02:55:18.072 --> 02:55:18.412]  Yeah.
[02:55:18.472 --> 02:55:20.853]  Hey, I've been following you since you started.
[02:55:21.573 --> 02:55:23.654]  I've been with you all along.
[02:55:23.814 --> 02:55:25.595]  I got a lot to ask you to tell you about.
[02:55:25.695 --> 02:55:27.336]  First off, Prostagard.
[02:55:27.936 --> 02:55:29.396]  Best product you got.
[02:55:30.057 --> 02:55:31.777]  I'm 64 years old.
[02:55:31.937 --> 02:55:33.498]  Nothing works for the prostate.
[02:55:34.062 --> 02:55:36.244]  That stuff worked the day I took it.
[02:55:36.564 --> 02:55:39.546]  When I ran out, two days later, I could feel it wear off.
[02:55:39.726 --> 02:55:41.868]  I used your other product, it worked.
[02:55:42.548 --> 02:55:51.775]  But the Prostagard, if man, all these dudes that are getting poisoned with this estrogen stuff would take Prostagard, man, that's the best product you've got.
[02:55:51.835 --> 02:55:54.317]  Hold on, because you mentioned something, let me say something.
[02:55:54.717 --> 02:55:59.160]  There are three things the FDA admits work, even though they hate supplements, actually four.
[02:55:59.881 --> 02:56:02.402]  Fish oil, saw palmetto,
[02:56:03.650 --> 02:56:04.250]  I don't know.
[02:56:30.100 --> 02:56:31.801]  But I've taken all of them, Alex.
[02:56:31.901 --> 02:56:35.023]  Nothing works like Frostigard, and you're out of it.
[02:56:35.063 --> 02:56:35.683]  You've been out.
[02:56:35.923 --> 02:56:38.905]  I usually have about six bottles, and so I've
[02:56:39.500 --> 02:56:42.842]  Screwed around, waited till I run out, now you've been out for months!
[02:56:42.862 --> 02:56:44.563]  Well, that, that, listen, that's what I keep telling the listeners.
[02:56:44.603 --> 02:56:45.684]  I'm gonna hold you over, stay there.
[02:56:46.344 --> 02:56:47.665]  I told listeners, that's where we're at.
[02:56:48.245 --> 02:56:55.409]  We got in this ketchup game with supply chain breakdowns, the bankruptcy and everything, where if we had all the products in, we'd have plenty of money, but we never have enough.
[02:56:55.449 --> 02:56:58.811]  So, we barely have enough money to only order a few things.
[02:56:59.771 --> 02:57:01.132]  And I'm trying to get us out of this.
[02:57:01.212 --> 02:57:02.213]  It's driving me crazy.
[02:57:04.154 --> 02:57:04.954]  Oh, it makes me mad.
[02:57:05.315 --> 02:57:07.076]  Anyways, we will get Prostagard back.
[02:57:07.967 --> 02:57:09.188]  We will get Prostagard back.
[02:57:10.228 --> 02:57:13.090]  But yeah, I need people to go to infowarestore.com.
[02:57:13.370 --> 02:57:15.911]  The problem is, you only buy when we discount, and there's so little profit.
[02:57:16.171 --> 02:57:19.933]  I mean, some of these things at 60% off store and free shipping, we're losing money.
[02:57:20.913 --> 02:57:23.555]  So, you know who's kept us there?
[02:57:23.595 --> 02:57:27.677]  People buying the books, signed, that's a fundraiser, and t-shirts that are fundraisers.
[02:57:28.550 --> 02:57:29.931]  We get a good margin on that.
[02:57:30.411 --> 02:57:31.731]  That's why it's, you know, $99.
[02:57:31.771 --> 02:57:33.412]  You know, the book costs $10.
[02:57:33.472 --> 02:57:34.112]  We need the money.
[02:57:34.533 --> 02:57:35.593]  Get an unsigned copy.
[02:57:36.513 --> 02:57:38.234]  Get a signed copy, mfullworkshore.com.
[02:57:38.254 --> 02:57:41.816]  And yeah, I want to bring all the products back, sir.
[02:57:42.356 --> 02:57:43.516]  We just don't have the money.
[02:57:43.776 --> 02:57:44.797]  Hold on, I'll come right back to you.
[02:57:47.967 --> 02:57:49.568]  I'm not on Team NFL.
[02:57:49.868 --> 02:57:51.349]  I'm not on Team NBA.
[02:57:51.529 --> 02:57:52.509]  I'm not on Team Olympics.
[02:57:52.790 --> 02:57:56.211]  I'm not on Team Globalist or Wokism in the New World Order.
[02:57:56.471 --> 02:58:06.697]  I'm on Team Humanity, ladies and gentlemen, that loves God and loves our families and loves humanity and knows that we're destined to do even more incredible things than we've already done together.
[02:58:06.857 --> 02:58:10.559]  And so, inspired by my conversation with Elon Musk recently,
[02:58:10.879 --> 02:58:11.640]  I think we're good to go.
[02:58:27.992 --> 02:58:36.942]  Wear it, it's a great conversation starter, and you know it's supporting the InfoWar that is at the very tip of the spear in the fight for Team Humanity.

[03:00:08.097 --> 03:00:12.879]  Alright, I was... From the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:13.799 --> 03:00:16.561]  I was about to go back to that last caller, but he hung up.
[03:00:17.821 --> 03:00:19.422]  Says he's been listening for 29 years.
[03:00:20.402 --> 03:00:21.943]  Let's talk to Mark in New York.
[03:00:22.023 --> 03:00:22.703]  Mark, you're on the air.
[03:00:22.743 --> 03:00:23.064]  Welcome.
[03:00:23.784 --> 03:00:27.425]  Hi, Alex.
[03:00:28.286 --> 03:00:28.626]  Welcome.
[03:00:29.746 --> 03:00:30.427]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:00:30.507 --> 03:00:35.389]  I just wanted to know, with the Pentagon, how do we
[03:00:36.044 --> 03:00:39.547]  How do we get the Pentagon to stop doing what they're doing?
[03:00:39.767 --> 03:00:40.768]  How do we go about that?
[03:00:57.781 --> 03:01:03.603]  They have been vetting globalists that literally hate America and are part of the New World Order for at least 30, 40 years.
[03:01:03.663 --> 03:01:06.704]  So, they've got almost all their people in the military at the top.
[03:01:07.144 --> 03:01:09.565]  The Justice Department, they attack our troops with poison shots.
[03:01:10.045 --> 03:01:12.446]  Yeah, it seems like the logical things have the military on our side.
[03:01:12.826 --> 03:01:14.687]  The military is captured by the enemy.
[03:01:15.587 --> 03:01:17.328]  Everybody says it's the military on the border.
[03:01:17.668 --> 03:01:19.789]  They're there bringing the illegals across.
[03:01:21.309 --> 03:01:21.610]  Wow.
[03:01:22.170 --> 03:01:22.750]  Incredible.
[03:01:23.482 --> 03:01:27.765]  My thing is, like, even with the troops, like, you know, they have families.
[03:01:28.425 --> 03:01:30.827]  I mean, you think they're going to go against you?
[03:01:30.847 --> 03:01:32.308]  Yeah, but what do you do when you're in the military?
[03:01:32.348 --> 03:01:33.829]  What's the number one rule in the military?
[03:01:39.072 --> 03:01:39.873]  Follow orders.
[03:01:41.574 --> 03:01:41.734]  Right.
[03:01:42.219 --> 03:01:43.700]  Following orders, that's what they're going to do.
[03:01:43.860 --> 03:01:47.183]  So we're going to have to conjure up and become our own military.
[03:01:47.343 --> 03:01:48.424]  That's what you're saying.
[03:01:48.444 --> 03:01:51.406]  They're going to get rid of the police, everything, to bring the country down, yeah.
[03:01:51.426 --> 03:01:55.389]  Everybody keeps looking at the military, like the Q-Thing, oh, the military's secretly on our side.
[03:01:55.710 --> 03:01:58.272]  Yeah, the average man or woman in the military are great people on average.
[03:01:58.292 --> 03:01:58.692]  They're good.
[03:01:58.712 --> 03:02:05.057]  Most of them aren't family or veterans, but at the top, they're New World Order, Blue Bloods, Ivy League.
[03:02:05.798 --> 03:02:08.560]  They see America as their enemy.
[03:02:09.380 --> 03:02:10.121]  They are sick.
[03:02:10.322 --> 03:02:13.006]  They are sick people and we need to get them out of there.
[03:02:13.327 --> 03:02:14.469]  I do videos, Alex.
[03:02:14.569 --> 03:02:15.711]  I put things online.
[03:02:16.071 --> 03:02:17.514]  I do everything that I can to help.
[03:02:17.614 --> 03:02:18.756]  I shop.
[03:02:18.856 --> 03:02:22.963]  I just bought the new shirt that you put out there.
[03:02:24.309 --> 03:02:28.572]  Well, let me say, with all the censorship, you're the people that make this show count.
[03:02:28.612 --> 03:02:34.915]  You're more important than I am, because if you don't share the clips still on Facebook and YouTube, where they still get out, we're going to lose this.
[03:02:34.955 --> 03:02:36.056]  But because of you, we're going to win.
[03:02:36.396 --> 03:02:37.917]  Mark, thank you so much, and God bless you.
[03:02:37.937 --> 03:02:38.518]  Happy New Year.
[03:02:39.158 --> 03:02:41.980]  Let's talk to Brighton in Florida.
[03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:42.640]  Brighton, go ahead.
[03:02:44.741 --> 03:02:45.242]  Hey, Alex.
[03:02:45.562 --> 03:02:46.242]  Good afternoon, man.
[03:02:46.282 --> 03:02:47.803]  Thank you so much for all you do.
[03:02:47.843 --> 03:02:48.163]  Thank you.
[03:02:49.184 --> 03:02:50.225]  I have a couple questions.
[03:02:50.825 --> 03:02:52.306]  I just kind of wanted your thoughts on
[03:02:52.915 --> 03:02:54.676]  First of all, Team Human, all the way.
[03:02:54.876 --> 03:02:55.496]  Love the shirts.
[03:02:55.636 --> 03:02:58.357]  Just bought one for myself and my best friend, Breein Foxx.
[03:02:59.817 --> 03:03:06.519]  My first question, we see obviously the shenanigans, the BS that happened in the 2020 election.
[03:03:07.359 --> 03:03:17.602]  What actions do you know of that are being taken or maybe will be taken that we haven't really heard about to try and prevent the amount of fraud that occurred?
[03:03:17.742 --> 03:03:21.163]  Because you see how long, I mean, you already see how long it took for
[03:03:21.721 --> 03:03:27.945]  You know, it's actually get litigated and even be viewed at, you know, the state judge level or the federal level.
[03:03:28.506 --> 03:03:31.067]  Yeah, I mean, you've got the states doing stuff about mail-in ballots.
[03:03:31.087 --> 03:03:33.329]  You've got people with verification going on.
[03:03:34.109 --> 03:03:37.912]  The big thing is they get more congressional seats, Democrat areas, with the illegals.
[03:03:37.952 --> 03:03:39.533]  That's how they kind of win right up front.
[03:03:40.274 --> 03:03:41.735]  We have to raise the awareness about it.
[03:03:42.642 --> 03:04:05.535]  We have such a landslide that the fraud can't overpower and that's why they're actually scared right now is a landslide that's so big people voting in dead people's names or people that have moved out of district voting for them they just don't have the numbers that's why they're in panic mode right now I want to remove Trump from the ballot is because right now if they had the election today he'd win by 20 points 30 points and then but because of fraud he would win by five
[03:04:06.335 --> 03:04:06.916]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:04:06.936 --> 03:04:12.880]  The thing that's a little scary to me, and I think, like somebody said earlier, man, we just gotta lift it up to God, but
[03:04:31.673 --> 03:04:33.794]  You know, I really think that it was a landslide.
[03:04:33.934 --> 03:04:41.019]  You know, I've traveled across the country, and you've probably, you know, done tenfold what I even could imagine, you know, as far as traveling.
[03:04:41.039 --> 03:04:45.302]  I've just never seen any type of real support for anybody.
[03:04:45.342 --> 03:04:45.882]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[03:04:45.902 --> 03:04:46.823]  He didn't have it.
[03:04:46.843 --> 03:04:48.864]  Trump won big time, but not big enough to stop the fraud.
[03:04:49.184 --> 03:04:50.385]  This time he's going to win in a landslide.
[03:04:50.405 --> 03:04:50.965]  Thanks for the call.
[03:04:51.386 --> 03:04:51.766]  Stay there.
[03:04:51.786 --> 03:04:53.227]  I'm going to introduce Jason Berman straight ahead.
[03:04:58.473 --> 03:05:03.937]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[03:05:04.677 --> 03:05:08.960]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners, and because it's so hard to produce.
[03:05:09.360 --> 03:05:13.743]  We finally have a limited run, back in supply, at infowarestore.com.
[03:05:15.184 --> 03:05:17.927]  So many people have serious issues.
[03:05:18.228 --> 03:05:19.349]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[03:05:19.809 --> 03:05:25.215]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[03:05:25.756 --> 03:05:31.182]  Most of the other iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements, so you don't download it.
[03:05:31.782 --> 03:05:34.545]  But this is pure atomic certified
[03:05:36.445 --> 03:05:37.646]  I don't know.
[03:06:02.731 --> 03:06:04.912]  Breaking through the lies of the New World Order.
[03:06:05.612 --> 03:06:06.513]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:08.273 --> 03:06:10.054]  Well, I gotta say this.
[03:06:11.575 --> 03:06:13.755]  Being a brainwasher is only evil of the universe.
[03:06:15.216 --> 03:06:16.176]  No, there's a lot of good.
[03:06:17.657 --> 03:06:19.158]  But Thomas Jefferson said it best.
[03:06:20.238 --> 03:06:24.139]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men do nothing.
[03:06:25.220 --> 03:06:27.701]  Well, we're doing something here today, good men and women.
[03:06:29.525 --> 03:06:32.891]  In the old days, you were seen as a coward if you wanted the women to do your fighting for you.
[03:06:32.912 --> 03:06:37.600]  But now, they're announcing they're going to conscript millions of women to fight in Ukraine!
[03:06:38.894 --> 03:06:41.395]  Even the former head of the European Forces and the U.S.
[03:06:41.435 --> 03:06:43.475]  General proposed that last week.
[03:06:43.535 --> 03:06:45.676]  That is just so disgusting.
[03:06:46.536 --> 03:06:53.598]  Jason Burmess, great filmmaker and talk show host, is about to take over here in the first live show in InfoWars.
[03:06:53.618 --> 03:06:55.539]  I mean, I guess Harrison Smith it is this morning.
[03:06:55.839 --> 03:06:57.859]  That was the first live InfoWars show.
[03:06:57.899 --> 03:07:00.300]  This is the first live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:07:00.340 --> 03:07:05.401]  And then the War Room with the great Owen Schroeder is coming up in about 54 minutes or 53 minutes.
[03:07:08.331 --> 03:07:11.513]  Infowars.com forward slash show, but I promise to go to all the callers.
[03:07:11.533 --> 03:07:13.434]  We got one more left in Massachusetts.
[03:07:13.474 --> 03:07:13.995]  That's Frank.
[03:07:14.355 --> 03:07:15.115]  Frank, you're on the air.
[03:07:15.135 --> 03:07:15.536]  Go ahead.
[03:07:18.578 --> 03:07:18.878]  Hello.
[03:07:19.378 --> 03:07:20.018]  Yes, Frank.
[03:07:20.439 --> 03:07:20.639]  Hello.
[03:07:20.679 --> 03:07:24.641]  Hey, I just, I want to say I renounced Satan in his direction.
[03:07:26.983 --> 03:07:28.024]  That's like on the Godfather.
[03:07:28.064 --> 03:07:30.605]  Do you renounce Satan and all his pumps?
[03:07:30.705 --> 03:07:31.246]  Yes, I do.
[03:07:32.086 --> 03:07:32.286]  Yes.
[03:07:32.386 --> 03:07:32.626]  Good.
[03:07:32.686 --> 03:07:33.067]  Excellent.
[03:07:33.647 --> 03:07:34.988]  I just want to say here on the East,
[03:07:35.461 --> 03:07:38.422]  That people, they are already immunocompromised.
[03:07:39.062 --> 03:07:44.744]  They're going like through two rounds of antibiotics, and they can't shake a cold for nothing.
[03:07:47.304 --> 03:07:48.925]  Yep, that's what the shot does, brothers.
[03:07:48.965 --> 03:07:54.326]  You see me read where they now say, oh, record heart attacks and stuff are caused by the new COVID.
[03:07:54.546 --> 03:07:56.267]  But why has it been happening for three years?
[03:07:57.372 --> 03:08:04.279]  Yes I have, and I didn't know if they had already released the new virus, or just, they're just immunocompromised.
[03:08:04.319 --> 03:08:05.941]  No, they're totally immunocompromised.
[03:08:06.521 --> 03:08:08.363]  They're totally, cancer's exploding.
[03:08:08.784 --> 03:08:10.365]  Did you see the insurance actuaries?
[03:08:10.425 --> 03:08:11.967]  At least 17 million dead from the shot.
[03:08:13.522 --> 03:08:16.803]  I heard about it but I did not see the, I didn't see the report.
[03:08:16.983 --> 03:08:22.165]  Well the report, we'll put it on screen for you, we've also put it out on X at Real Alex Jones, everybody should get it.
[03:08:22.765 --> 03:08:25.526]  It's a new world order and they're black swan tell.
[03:08:26.187 --> 03:08:32.609]  And they basically tell you what they're doing, it's very important.
[03:08:32.809 --> 03:08:40.712]  Two questions really quick, you know my belief on the election is that presidents are selected and not elected.
[03:08:42.509 --> 03:08:54.559]  You know, really, you know, one of his last accomplishments, so to speak, was that, you know, he put Jerusalem as the base in Israel, like their main, you know, headquarters, so to speak.
[03:08:55.260 --> 03:08:56.040]  He put the U.S.
[03:08:56.141 --> 03:08:56.641]  Embassy there.
[03:08:57.722 --> 03:08:57.982]  Right.
[03:08:58.783 --> 03:09:10.753]  You know, and, you know, Obama and Biden there, so to speak, are very, you know, anti-Israel and, you know, I don't want to say anti-Semitic, but, you know, he's... So what's your question?
[03:09:11.892 --> 03:09:21.356]  Well, the question is, you know, it seems like the New World Order is anti-Trump, but it seems to me like he's next in line to be selected to be president.
[03:09:22.357 --> 03:09:29.980]  They hate his guts, but they want him to be president because if he's elected, he will be the cherry on top of the Civil War.
[03:09:31.480 --> 03:09:35.042]  Well, he certainly balkanizes things and polarizes them, but the media did that.
[03:09:35.882 --> 03:09:39.404]  There's different power structures in the world, and so
[03:09:40.982 --> 03:09:41.742]  Moving the U.S.
[03:09:41.822 --> 03:09:46.044]  Embassy to Jerusalem, I mean, Israel's not going anywhere.
[03:09:46.064 --> 03:09:46.884]  They have nuclear weapons.
[03:09:47.084 --> 03:09:48.144]  I'm not obsessed with Israel.
[03:09:48.704 --> 03:09:50.045]  In fact, I have an allergy to it.
[03:09:50.065 --> 03:09:51.385]  I'm just really sick of hearing about it.
[03:09:51.665 --> 03:09:52.565]  It's a tiny country.
[03:09:52.606 --> 03:09:53.486]  It's a big distraction.
[03:09:53.506 --> 03:09:57.127]  I'm not against it, but I also don't worship it and think about it all day and all the rest of the stuff.
[03:09:57.147 --> 03:10:01.668]  I got my own life, my own things I'm trying to do, my own Second Amendment, my own free market, my own Constitution.
[03:10:02.148 --> 03:10:02.829]  I appreciate your call.
[03:10:02.869 --> 03:10:03.889]  I really didn't hear a question there.
[03:10:05.169 --> 03:10:08.073]  Um, people that just woodpecker Israel all day.
[03:10:08.093 --> 03:10:09.334]  It just, okay, great.
[03:10:09.955 --> 03:10:11.077]  It's like every subject.
[03:10:11.217 --> 03:10:12.358]  Oh, what about Israel?
[03:10:12.699 --> 03:10:13.600]  I don't want to eat bugs.
[03:10:13.720 --> 03:10:14.821]  Oh, you're coming up for Israel.
[03:10:15.682 --> 03:10:17.144]  I think gas prices are too high.
[03:10:17.184 --> 03:10:18.346]  Why are you coming up for Israel?
[03:10:18.766 --> 03:10:22.090]  It's like an intellectual, I'm not saying the caller did this, but it's like an intellectual
[03:10:23.516 --> 03:10:26.418]  Way to just turn the chessboard over and say, I'm not debating all this.
[03:10:27.299 --> 03:10:29.421]  They gave the Israelis all the poison shots too.
[03:10:29.461 --> 03:10:30.561]  They're under the same New World Order.
[03:10:30.902 --> 03:10:33.063]  Netanyahu in a poll is 15% support.
[03:10:33.564 --> 03:10:34.484]  And the left wants him out.
[03:10:34.725 --> 03:10:38.167]  That's an inner battle, you know, over who controls Israel.
[03:10:38.207 --> 03:10:43.571]  I'm not in the middle of that Jewish Civil War, or the Islamic Jewish Civil War, and just all of it.
[03:10:43.591 --> 03:10:45.673]  I'm just like, I'm like Senator Rand Paul.
[03:10:45.973 --> 03:10:47.414]  Cut off all the foreign aid to all of them.
[03:10:47.574 --> 03:10:50.296]  Egypt, Israel, all of them.
[03:10:50.357 --> 03:10:51.497]  And to hell with
[03:10:52.915 --> 03:10:54.877]  You know, Hamas and with AIPAC.
[03:10:54.937 --> 03:10:57.821]  It's just, it's not... It's like I'm done.
[03:10:59.022 --> 03:11:01.425]  It's like some, you know, ugly woman wants you to date her.
[03:11:01.445 --> 03:11:03.027]  She tells everybody you asked her out and you didn't.
[03:11:03.047 --> 03:11:04.229]  It's like, get out of my life!
[03:11:05.070 --> 03:11:05.931]  I don't want to be around you.
[03:11:07.133 --> 03:11:09.974]  All right, we're going to skip this break so Jason Bermans gets his time back.
[03:11:10.074 --> 03:11:12.295]  Great documentary filmmaker, producer of his films.
[03:11:12.655 --> 03:11:16.156]  Got a lot to cover here today in the first live Alex Jones edition.
[03:11:16.596 --> 03:11:18.116]  Please remember, I need funds.
[03:11:18.937 --> 03:11:22.698]  I've been so excited about being back on X. We're reaching tens of millions of people there today.
[03:11:22.978 --> 03:11:24.079]  It's not really bringing funds in.
[03:11:24.139 --> 03:11:25.280]  We need funds to operate.
[03:11:25.300 --> 03:11:26.601]  We've got great products you need.

[03:12:30.615 --> 03:12:30.895]  I think
[03:12:53.719 --> 03:12:54.581]  Reckon order things.

[03:12:56.104 --> 03:12:56.685]  Spread the word.
[03:12:56.705 --> 03:12:57.467]  God bless you all.
[03:12:57.787 --> 03:13:00.312]  Follow us on X at RealAlexJones.
[03:13:00.433 --> 03:13:01.755]  Jason Bermas takes over now.
[03:13:03.345 --> 03:13:08.008]  Happy New Year Alex Jones and Happy New Year fellow InfoWarriors!
[03:13:08.528 --> 03:13:11.670]  We gotta start with the Epstein Info.
[03:13:11.730 --> 03:13:15.013]  What are we actually going to get?
[03:13:15.073 --> 03:13:32.564]  Now, I've got to admit my journey into Jeffrey Epstein actually began with InfoWars.com well over a decade, closer to a decade and a half ago when the Florida story started to break and people realized
[03:13:33.024 --> 03:13:41.085]  That this quote-unquote billionaire had been trafficking in young girls, women, and maybe even beyond.
[03:13:41.105 --> 03:13:57.168]  But we're not going to get there yet because I've really done mega research on the documentation that is out there and I don't think that there's anything brand new coming out in the sense that we're going to see new documentation.
[03:13:57.208 --> 03:13:58.769]  I'll go over why.
[03:13:58.789 --> 03:14:00.229]  What we are going to see
[03:14:01.411 --> 03:14:02.172]  Yes, we are.
[03:14:18.471 --> 03:14:23.974]  X is there now, it's not as censored as it was, so now we're like, we already know all this, but the general public doesn't.
[03:14:24.354 --> 03:14:27.995]  So it's kind of like a kid not knowing Santa Claus is real, and the adults know.
[03:14:28.015 --> 03:14:29.796]  We're about to find out Santa Claus isn't real.
[03:14:30.176 --> 03:14:32.137]  What's big is that it's all Breaking Bad.
[03:14:32.157 --> 03:14:32.617]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:14:33.598 --> 03:14:34.258]  No, absolutely.
[03:14:34.298 --> 03:14:41.502]  You know, Alex, I'm glad you're here, because there's so much that's already publicly available that I think that people really have to understand.
[03:14:41.602 --> 03:14:42.322]  For instance,
[03:14:43.024 --> 03:14:50.386]  In the Ghislaine Maxwell case itself, let's take a look at this, guys, because this is so important.
[03:14:51.266 --> 03:15:06.330]  What we really got was confirmation that Jeffrey Epstein literally had hard drives full of videos that were never entered into evidence other than their... That's right, that's the sex videos, that's the real blackmail the FBI got.
[03:15:07.561 --> 03:15:08.101]  Absolutely.
[03:15:08.181 --> 03:15:12.144]  And look, here we have burned DVDs and CDs that are labeled.
[03:15:12.204 --> 03:15:14.005]  Again, we didn't get to see what was on them.
[03:15:14.225 --> 03:15:19.849]  They were even blacking out, in what was publicly available, paintings that were there.
[03:15:20.509 --> 03:15:22.270]  However, here's really the coup de grace.
[03:15:22.290 --> 03:15:24.151]  You want a quote-unquote client list.
[03:15:24.512 --> 03:15:25.692]  Well, it goes well beyond that.
[03:15:25.952 --> 03:15:34.538]  What you're looking at are binders that are blacked out that more than likely have compromised individuals and photographs
[03:15:35.178 --> 03:15:50.713]  Of those individuals and that's just scraping the surface inside the safe that they found we had Jeffrey Epstein with a passport under a different name and a Saudi Arabian address this is somebody
[03:15:51.693 --> 03:15:59.079]  That has really been involved in the quote-unquote deep state network for decades upon decades.
[03:15:59.620 --> 03:16:15.093]  So when we're talking about a quote-unquote client list, what we really are talking about are associates, individuals that are indeed compromised, video evidence we will probably never get, and now a bunch of different names will be redacted.
[03:16:15.133 --> 03:16:19.797]  Well, I'd also like to remind people that when a lot of these documents were coming out,
[03:16:20.729 --> 03:16:23.973]  There were names that were indeed named.
[03:16:24.393 --> 03:16:39.891]  So three and a half years ago I did a video over 70 witnesses named in documents and on the air we read those names and there are certainly already people of interest that need to be discussed such as Leslie Groff and Sarah Kalin
[03:16:40.291 --> 03:16:53.043]  Who by all means were hardcore associates and perhaps minions of, I want to be very careful here, of Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein when it came to regards of what?
[03:16:54.048 --> 03:16:56.689]  The individuals that were actually being trafficked.
[03:16:56.709 --> 03:16:58.710]  No charges have ever been brought against those.
[03:16:58.990 --> 03:17:04.732]  In those documents, separate people that worked within the house were also named.
[03:17:05.552 --> 03:17:16.596]  So, you know, I think that a lot of the names that are already out there, whether they be George Mitchell, Glenn Dubin, Bill Richardson... And by the way, Jason, I'm going to punch you out listening while I eat lunch, but...
[03:17:17.256 --> 03:17:19.217]  You're on target here, and I'm glad you bring this up.
[03:17:19.617 --> 03:17:23.600]  The videotapes, the safes, the FBI, you should go through that.
[03:17:23.620 --> 03:17:24.300]  I know you were.
[03:17:24.320 --> 03:17:28.022]  That is, well, we're chasing lists and flight logs.
[03:17:28.742 --> 03:17:33.105]  That's a distraction from what, the FBI needs to release the videotapes.
[03:17:33.125 --> 03:17:34.866]  They need to release the blackmail footage.
[03:17:35.266 --> 03:17:36.467]  That's really what was going on here.
[03:17:36.487 --> 03:17:44.391]  These people knew they were coming to do this as a ritual to be part of the club, whereas other mafias make you kill somebody so they can trust you and control you and have dirt on you.
[03:17:44.591 --> 03:17:45.952]  These people make you have sex with children.
[03:17:47.219 --> 03:17:48.040]  Well, absolutely.
[03:17:48.080 --> 03:18:01.138]  And you know, Alex, there's another story that kind of coincides with this because we know that the FBI has been sitting on this information since the 90s when we had people come forward to them and the NYPD on Jeffrey Epstein.
[03:18:01.378 --> 03:18:04.322]  But think about the Wiener laptop for a second.
[03:18:04.722 --> 03:18:09.049]  A lot of people think that when Wiener went to jail, it was because of that laptop.
[03:18:09.250 --> 03:18:17.743]  That laptop has never been looked at or disclosed to the public, to my knowledge, via the FBI, the NSA, the CIA, or anybody else.
[03:18:17.803 --> 03:18:18.765]  And in fact, when you look
[03:18:19.372 --> 03:18:26.574]  And what actually happened to Anthony Weiner, what happened was the fact that you had one of his victims blow the whistle.
[03:18:27.094 --> 03:18:31.476]  And she is the one who provided the Skype and the Snapchats.
[03:18:31.516 --> 03:18:32.556]  And there she is right there.
[03:18:32.996 --> 03:18:37.317]  They never went into that laptop in which Huma Abedin had access.
[03:18:37.638 --> 03:18:43.179]  And of course, her relationship with Hillary Clinton would have been revealed even further.
[03:18:43.359 --> 03:18:46.440]  Yeah, she's like the right hand lady of Hillary.
[03:18:46.520 --> 03:18:49.001]  And then Weiner is the protege of Chuckie Schumer.
[03:18:50.251 --> 03:18:51.251]  Absolutely, and what does he do?
[03:18:51.551 --> 03:19:07.256]  He spends less than two years in a country club prison, and then he's put out in the media once again, even tried to give him a podcast with Curtis Silva, or Sliva, of the Guardian Angels in New York City.
[03:19:07.496 --> 03:19:10.137]  That's how this really works, folks.
[03:19:10.417 --> 03:19:15.218]  And let's talk about Trump for a minute, because I know that you were concerned, for instance, that he would be on the list.
[03:19:15.778 --> 03:19:22.581]  These documents that we're actually talking about, first of all, I don't believe in a list, but the documents out there already named Trump.
[03:19:22.942 --> 03:19:24.803]  So I don't think you're going to see him come up.
[03:19:24.843 --> 03:19:25.963]  And what do I mean by that?
[03:19:26.003 --> 03:19:29.225]  Well, they named him in a way that the media has downplayed.
[03:19:29.245 --> 03:19:31.646]  And I'll show you these articles right here, folks.
[03:19:32.728 --> 03:19:37.430]  Is that the unsealed documents detail Epstein's victim's recruitment at Mar-a-Lago?
[03:19:37.450 --> 03:19:40.151]  Well, that victim was Virginia Gaffrey Roberts.
[03:19:40.771 --> 03:19:43.632]  And in fact, right here, you can read it.
[03:19:43.692 --> 03:19:46.213]  Donald Trump was also a good friend of Jeffrey's.
[03:19:46.273 --> 03:19:46.993]  That part is true.
[03:19:47.333 --> 03:19:52.575]  He did not partake in any of any sex with any of us, but he flirted with me.
[03:19:52.915 --> 03:19:57.317]  It's true that he didn't partake in any sex with us, but it's not true that he flirted with me.
[03:19:57.357 --> 03:19:58.037]  So she's saying that
[03:19:58.518 --> 03:20:01.162]  He didn't flirt with her and he didn't partake in any sex.
[03:20:01.222 --> 03:20:02.645]  Donald Trump never flirted with me.
[03:20:02.985 --> 03:20:06.030]  Then the next sentence he'd laugh and tell Jeffrey, you've got the life.
[03:20:06.171 --> 03:20:07.232]  I never said that to her.
[03:20:07.773 --> 03:20:09.717]  So we already know.
[03:20:10.572 --> 03:20:19.535]  That his name is out there, but it's via the fact that he kicked Epstein out after this incident at Mar-a-Lago, where what?
[03:20:19.715 --> 03:20:23.176]  He was trying to recruit Gaffrey Roberts and possibly others.
[03:20:23.556 --> 03:20:25.537]  So I don't think that he's going to be in there.
[03:20:25.677 --> 03:20:29.018]  RFK Jr., however, we already know he's on the flight logs.
[03:20:29.058 --> 03:20:30.938]  He's recently addressed Dwayne Maxwell.
[03:20:30.958 --> 03:20:31.778]  Jason, this is so huge.
[03:20:31.838 --> 03:20:36.160]  I'm going to keep listening, but on the show, what hour do we have open tomorrow, guys?
[03:20:38.143 --> 03:20:41.625]  On the main broadcast, the fourth hour is the main broadcast too.
[03:20:41.645 --> 03:20:42.265]  Find out right now.
[03:20:43.365 --> 03:20:44.846]  I want you to come on and do this.
[03:20:45.307 --> 03:20:46.988]  Again, we know about the videotapes.
[03:20:47.448 --> 03:20:48.428]  I need to talk about these more.
[03:20:48.448 --> 03:20:49.049]  I talk about them some.
[03:20:49.069 --> 03:20:49.629]  You're absolutely right.
[03:20:49.989 --> 03:20:51.210]  The FBI got those.
[03:20:51.270 --> 03:20:52.571]  We have the records when they raided it.
[03:20:53.071 --> 03:20:54.872]  It shouldn't be, where's the client list?
[03:20:55.252 --> 03:20:56.233]  That's what they just put together.
[03:20:56.373 --> 03:20:59.294]  It needs to be, where are all the videotapes?
[03:20:59.395 --> 03:21:00.415]  What was in the houses?
[03:21:00.755 --> 03:21:01.476]  What was in the...
[03:21:03.058 --> 03:21:03.599]  I don't think so.
[03:21:20.506 --> 03:21:20.886]  Yes sir.
[03:21:21.086 --> 03:21:22.147]  Alright, I want to start over.
[03:21:22.167 --> 03:21:23.387]  Everybody's watching now anyways.
[03:21:23.408 --> 03:21:25.228]  I'm going to put this out on X today.
[03:21:25.268 --> 03:21:27.390]  When you're done, I'm going to take this and put this whole thing out.
[03:21:27.670 --> 03:21:30.231]  But I want you on tomorrow.
[03:21:30.751 --> 03:21:33.713]  That's on Wednesday, January 3rd at noon to talk about this.
[03:21:34.945 --> 03:21:40.070]  And you know, Alex, even beyond what you said, there seems to be more than one island, okay?
[03:21:40.110 --> 03:21:43.513]  So, he actually talks about on tape before he was arrested.
[03:21:43.553 --> 03:21:45.595]  No, no, everything you're saying is true, because I've done the research too.
[03:21:45.615 --> 03:21:47.416]  You're just so good at organizing it, so I can't wait.
[03:21:47.816 --> 03:21:49.298]  You should put a new film out about this.
[03:21:49.318 --> 03:21:50.539]  The definitive Jeffrey Epstein.
[03:21:52.541 --> 03:21:55.184]  Jones, if I had the time, you want to do it, we'll talk about it.
[03:21:55.204 --> 03:22:02.211]  Because obviously, InfoWars is back in a big way this year on X. I think it's extremely important, especially in this election year.
[03:22:02.851 --> 03:22:05.434]  And this is like an election year of no other.
[03:22:05.474 --> 03:22:12.741]  There are so many moving parts to this whole thing and what's going on in the globe post-COVID-1984 nightmare.
[03:22:12.761 --> 03:22:13.842]  But this is a big part of it.
[03:22:14.222 --> 03:22:23.625]  Because, you know, I really believe that when you dig down deep enough into that Epstein network, what you really get to is the click from the Iran-Contra network.
[03:22:23.685 --> 03:22:24.305]  Because why?
[03:22:24.325 --> 03:22:33.249]  Epstein was close friends with Prince Andrew, and what nobody discusses about Prince Andrew is he was their number one arms dealer.
[03:22:33.549 --> 03:22:35.889]  That's what he did for the royal family.
[03:22:36.210 --> 03:22:37.830]  He cut a bunch of arms deals.
[03:22:38.070 --> 03:22:43.432]  And then why would Epstein have a Saudi Arabian address and a passport, really, to go there?
[03:22:44.236 --> 03:22:56.583]  Israel was a major component in the Iran-Contra affair and again there are these moving components you were talking about it prior where they would actually get the weapons that were smuggled via Czechoslovakia
[03:22:57.429 --> 03:22:59.110]  And then you've got Peter Nygaard
[03:23:27.833 --> 03:23:28.293]  So big!
[03:23:28.494 --> 03:23:32.457]  And Peter Nygaard, you know, getting into the eugenics aspects.
[03:23:32.537 --> 03:23:47.088]  In fact, on that tape I was discussing prior, it was recorded by Steve Bannon, Bannon sitting on maybe 18 hours of interviews with him, put out a short trailer that I was going to show called The Monsters, where he calls them islands of Dr. Moreau.
[03:23:47.568 --> 03:23:53.193]  And then you find out that the New Mexico ranch that was never investigated, one that
[03:23:53.860 --> 03:23:58.890]  Bill Richardson apparently was visiting, according to these documents that we've been discussing today.
[03:23:58.930 --> 03:24:04.240]  That's the former governor of New York, a close Clinton associate, a CFR member.
[03:24:05.566 --> 03:24:17.591]  That was a quote-unquote baby-making ranch where you can see the mainline reports that what he was trying to have an island of Epstein clones or super Epsteins.
[03:24:17.611 --> 03:24:19.131]  You can't make this stuff up.
[03:24:19.451 --> 03:24:24.773]  So getting to Nygaard, Nygaard was just recently convicted of one of the many crimes.
[03:24:24.793 --> 03:24:29.995]  He was having women bring babies to term to suck all their juices and inject them into himself.
[03:24:30.015 --> 03:24:31.496]  So we're gonna, you're gonna cover it all now.
[03:24:31.516 --> 03:24:34.577]  We're gonna cover it in depth tomorrow, 12 noon, Jason.
[03:24:35.572 --> 03:24:36.915]  Twelve noon sounds great, Alex.
[03:24:44.990 --> 03:24:46.571]  So many different aspects of it.
[03:24:46.591 --> 03:24:49.532]  I mean, think about what just happened to Ghislaine Maxwell.
[03:24:49.572 --> 03:24:51.813]  She should be serving a life sentence.
[03:24:52.013 --> 03:24:55.675]  And the truth of the matter is what there's an appeals process.
[03:24:56.455 --> 03:24:59.617]  I don't think that she's going to spend the rest of her life in prison.
[03:25:00.057 --> 03:25:09.562]  If unfortunately we keep the same type of infrastructure or system we currently have, because our constitutional Republic has completely and totally fallen apart.
[03:25:09.602 --> 03:25:11.843]  This is just a highlight of that.
[03:25:11.943 --> 03:25:12.143]  And look,
[03:25:12.990 --> 03:25:23.953]  To Alex's credit, he was at the forefront of this in the late 1990s, making documentaries called, what, America Destroyed by Design, and that is what's currently happening.
[03:25:24.093 --> 03:25:28.814]  And that's why we have to get the correct narrative about Epstein out there.
[03:25:28.834 --> 03:25:30.094]  You know, he mentioned Nygaard.
[03:25:30.734 --> 03:25:39.577]  Alex was actually being really nice when he said women, because the accusations are that he was impregnating girls as young as 14.
[03:25:41.928 --> 03:25:53.815]  Forcibly having them have abortions, then taking that aborted fetal tissue, converting it into stem cells, and having it injected into him, in what?
[03:25:54.475 --> 03:25:56.917]  His quest to live forever.
[03:25:57.317 --> 03:25:59.418]  The ultimate transhumanist goal.
[03:25:59.618 --> 03:26:03.400]  And really, a goal of the elites throughout history.
[03:26:03.440 --> 03:26:08.543]  If you think about it, the fables of the tree or fountains of youth.
[03:26:09.102 --> 03:26:09.962]  To live forever.
[03:26:10.682 --> 03:26:22.406]  And right now, we have a class of people, a predator class of people that truly believe not only that this is possible, but we are on the cusp of this technology.
[03:26:22.806 --> 03:26:26.447]  And that's why transhumanism has been something that
[03:26:27.512 --> 03:26:33.256]  It's been at the focal point of my work for some time and will continue to be in the future.
[03:26:33.316 --> 03:26:45.724]  In fact, one of the clips that we're going to be showing today in this very important fourth hour is my question to Vivek Ramaswamy at a local town hall here in Iowa just a couple weeks ago.
[03:26:46.404 --> 03:27:01.714]  In which I asked him about his background in biotech, in the field of xenotransplantation, which is the chimeric process of having organs, human organs, grow in other organisms such as pigs.
[03:27:01.834 --> 03:27:06.917]  Yes, this is not only a reality, but it's actually FDA approved through United Therapeutics.
[03:27:07.277 --> 03:27:10.019]  Asking him about that, and how far is too far,
[03:27:10.499 --> 03:27:21.073]  And whether he believes the transgender movement is a pathway into the transhuman one, as I not only believe, but I think I have demonstrated time and time again.
[03:27:21.093 --> 03:27:26.139]  So you'll get his response to that, then you'll get my response after the fact to that.
[03:27:26.159 --> 03:27:29.303]  We've got to take a break in about 90 seconds.
[03:27:30.405 --> 03:27:40.128]  But when we come back before we get to Vivek Ramaswamy and that town hall question, I'm going to show you this clip from Steve Bannon.
[03:27:40.308 --> 03:27:47.550]  I want to see this documentary, The Monsters, in which he sat down with Jeffrey Epstein on several occasions.
[03:27:48.110 --> 03:27:53.996]  And really, I can't speculate what they talked about, other than what is in this tape.
[03:27:54.536 --> 03:28:03.345]  And what is in this tape is startling, because he talks about not only one island, but two islands, and them being islands of Dr. Moreau.
[03:28:04.045 --> 03:28:06.768]  Well, that is an open reference.
[03:28:07.202 --> 03:28:10.005]  To not only eugenics, but chimeric eugenics.
[03:28:10.065 --> 03:28:16.372]  In other words, the merging of human beings with animals and other types of biologies.
[03:28:16.392 --> 03:28:21.979]  If you haven't read the books or seen the film, I would have you do so.
[03:28:22.319 --> 03:28:27.385]  I mean, just to use that term is kind of horrific and frightening unto itself.
[03:28:28.373 --> 03:28:32.634]  Before we take that break, I do want to say, it's time to support InfoWars.com.
[03:28:32.854 --> 03:28:43.796]  Obviously, they, and I mean they, have been through a lot in the past, not only year, but several years, hanging on by the skin, I'll not only say of his teeth, but by their nuts.
[03:28:44.316 --> 03:28:46.897]  And I hope they're coming back stronger than ever.
[03:28:47.037 --> 03:28:50.817]  So InfoWarsStore.com, get the books, get the supplements.
[03:28:51.077 --> 03:28:54.538]  We'll be back with this Bannon trailer after this.
[03:28:56.997 --> 03:29:00.240]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[03:29:01.521 --> 03:29:06.064]  Where were you when the globals were caught trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[03:29:06.705 --> 03:29:09.627]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?
[03:29:10.148 --> 03:29:10.848]  Well, I know where you are.
[03:29:11.228 --> 03:29:15.192]  You're watching and listening to Infowars.com right now, and I salute you and thank you.
[03:29:15.712 --> 03:29:21.637]  And I want to encourage all of you who've been in this fight so long to realize we've reached the critical juncture in the battle now.
[03:29:22.337 --> 03:29:25.140]  And a key tool in that fight is the Great Awakening
[03:29:25.760 --> 03:29:28.881]  Defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[03:29:29.301 --> 03:29:32.521]  This is my second book, part two of The Great Recent War for the World.
[03:29:32.942 --> 03:29:35.822]  It's a longer book, a quite frankly more powerful book.
[03:29:36.582 --> 03:29:40.643]  And just like the last book went to number one, it is up to you to send us a number one right now.
[03:29:40.963 --> 03:29:44.884]  This is a cultural fight against the globalists and it funds the Info War.

[03:30:44.313 --> 03:30:50.059]  And tell everybody you know, and those you don't know, tune into the live show at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:30:50.340 --> 03:30:51.801]  God bless and we're going into 2024 together.
[03:30:56.969 --> 03:31:03.671]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the globalist agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[03:31:03.691 --> 03:31:17.694]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections masquerading as vaccines.
[03:31:17.854 --> 03:31:22.735]  It is so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives oblivious
[03:31:24.241 --> 03:31:26.883]  If you realize ignorance is not bliss, it equals death.
[03:31:28.510 --> 03:31:48.942]  But people are starting to really understand how serious things are, and that's a hard thing to do, because to wake up to a dystopic reality and realize that we're in the middle of a giant biological weapons war against humanity, and that there's mass sterilization that's already taking place, cutting off all the major energy sources, is really hard to deal with, but it's the reality.
[03:31:49.502 --> 03:31:53.704]  Facing it is our only chance of turning this around, because stuff's about to get really, really nasty.
[03:31:54.084 --> 03:31:54.725]  InfoWars.com.
[03:31:58.521 --> 03:32:00.022]  I'm not on Team NBA.
[03:32:00.202 --> 03:32:01.183]  I'm not on Team Olympics.
[03:32:01.463 --> 03:32:04.905]  I'm not on Team Globalist or Wokism in the New World Order.
[03:32:05.125 --> 03:32:15.370]  I'm on Team Humanity, ladies and gentlemen, that loves God and loves our families and loves humanity and knows that we're destined to do even more incredible things than we've already done together.
[03:32:15.531 --> 03:32:21.754]  And so, inspired by my conversation with Elon Musk recently, where he agreed with my idea to call it Team Humanity,
[03:32:22.054 --> 03:32:26.535]  We've launched two limited edition t-shirts at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:32:26.815 --> 03:32:30.777]  Let people know that, hey, it isn't about the football games, or it isn't even about the UFC.
[03:32:31.257 --> 03:32:35.338]  It's about Team Humanity being under globalist attack.
[03:32:35.618 --> 03:32:45.621]  You can wear it, it's a great conversation starter, and you know it's supporting the InfoWar that is at the very tip of the spear in the fight for Team Humanity.
[03:32:45.921 --> 03:32:50.583]  Get your limited edition Team Humanity t-shirts right now at InfoWarsTore.com, and I thank you.
[03:32:58.979 --> 03:33:04.923]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[03:33:17.012 --> 03:33:18.153]  And we are back!
[03:33:18.634 --> 03:33:20.095]  It is the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:21.300 --> 03:33:33.791]  Folks, I know that we've been focusing on Virginia Gaffrey Roberts, those documents, but there's other documents out there and other eyewitness testimony as the victims with Jeffrey Epstein.
[03:33:33.891 --> 03:33:38.395]  I mean, when you look at just the public ones, you literally are talking about
[03:33:39.095 --> 03:33:41.355]  In the hundreds, publicly.
[03:33:41.615 --> 03:33:51.517]  I mean, even when they quote-unquote arrested the guy and he was spending time in jail, he was leaving on almost a daily basis.
[03:33:51.577 --> 03:33:54.098]  In fact, a private investigator would follow him.
[03:33:54.638 --> 03:34:02.059]  He was able to go into other private residences and he was visited by young women, possibly even girls.
[03:34:03.119 --> 03:34:07.460]  Was not able to confirm what their ages are.
[03:34:07.500 --> 03:34:08.440]  Again, all this stuff
[03:34:09.168 --> 03:34:10.469]  In the public arena.
[03:34:10.569 --> 03:34:15.734]  Now, on top of that, when you look at another victim, Sarah Ronesome.
[03:34:16.154 --> 03:34:30.006]  Now, she claims to not only have watched some of the videotapes of his wealthy friends having sex with female victims for blackmail, but says that she actually has copies stashed.
[03:34:30.066 --> 03:34:35.531]  And she is another one of the more named, aka more prominent victims
[03:34:36.238 --> 03:34:40.364]  In this case, so look, I'm waiting for all this stuff.
[03:34:40.384 --> 03:34:43.389]  I think it's extremely important that we get it.
[03:34:44.318 --> 03:34:54.245]  But let's go to this trailer of Jeffrey Epstein and let him tell you for himself that he had quote-unquote islands of what?
[03:34:54.585 --> 03:34:56.867]  Islands of Dr. Moreau.
[03:34:56.887 --> 03:35:03.591]  The month marks two years since the death of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein inside a New York City jail.
[03:35:03.611 --> 03:35:05.152]  We were underage.
[03:35:05.592 --> 03:35:06.493]  We were little girls.
[03:35:06.513 --> 03:35:09.235]  By the time I was 16, I brought him up to 75 girls.
[03:35:12.057 --> 03:35:14.058]  We live essentially like he was Gatsby.
[03:35:14.438 --> 03:35:17.559]  He was an absolutely terrifying person to encounter.
[03:35:18.740 --> 03:35:19.801]  You own an island.
[03:35:20.081 --> 03:35:20.361]  Two islands.
[03:35:20.461 --> 03:35:21.141]  The islands of Dr. Moreau?
[03:35:21.161 --> 03:35:21.361]  Correct.
[03:35:25.234 --> 03:35:32.682]  Jeffrey Epstein was a billionaire New York businessman whose vast wealth bought an arrogance that knew no limits.
[03:35:33.002 --> 03:35:36.265]  He acted as if he could have anything he craved.
[03:35:36.505 --> 03:35:43.312]  Reporting, the FBI is now looking into how it can interview Britain's Prince Andrew over his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.
[03:35:44.173 --> 03:35:48.077]  I may be living from old thinking, but the future is for the way women think.
[03:35:49.013 --> 03:35:49.734]  The way women think.
[03:35:49.974 --> 03:35:50.374]  That's correct.
[03:35:50.554 --> 03:35:56.099]  Is that not a SOP because of all the depravity you've done against young women?
[03:35:56.499 --> 03:36:00.282]  Your new SOP is that women's thinking is the future?
[03:36:00.603 --> 03:36:04.166]  No, I've always believed that women have to be able to take over.
[03:36:04.446 --> 03:36:06.908]  I'm a firm believer and supporter of Time's Up.
[03:36:07.408 --> 03:36:14.334]  Federal prosecutors said yesterday video of Epstein's jail cell when he made his first suicide attempt no longer exists.
[03:36:14.634 --> 03:36:16.396]  I'm Jeffrey Edward Epstein.
[03:36:17.515 --> 03:36:19.057]  Have you ever been convicted of a crime?
[03:36:20.258 --> 03:36:20.498]  Yes.
[03:36:21.098 --> 03:36:26.343]  Epstein got away with his crimes because nearly every element of society allowed him to get away with them.
[03:36:26.563 --> 03:36:33.530]  This morning we're learning new details of the exact cause of death of former registered sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein.
[03:36:33.730 --> 03:36:37.373]  The greatest threat to people put in solitary confinement is they try to kill themselves.
[03:36:37.654 --> 03:36:38.214]  Imagine that.
[03:36:38.875 --> 03:36:41.818]  You're only in a room for 24 hours and you start to go crazy.
[03:36:46.531 --> 03:36:47.351]  So there it is.
[03:36:47.912 --> 03:36:50.493]  That is the trailer for The Monsters.
[03:36:52.013 --> 03:36:53.033]  I'm going to shift gears.
[03:36:53.314 --> 03:37:00.976]  Although I don't think that we're shifting gears far because again, the baby making ranch, the islands of Dr. Moreau.
[03:37:01.116 --> 03:37:02.777]  At the end of the day, what are we talking about?
[03:37:02.797 --> 03:37:04.298]  We're talking about eugenics.
[03:37:05.058 --> 03:37:05.178]  And
[03:37:05.891 --> 03:37:07.472]  There's a book that we're going to get back to.
[03:37:07.832 --> 03:37:12.174]  This is by Martine Rothblatt, formerly Martin Rothblatt.
[03:37:12.234 --> 03:37:12.674]  This is from 1997.
[03:37:14.515 --> 03:37:20.078]  Unzipped Jeans Taking Charge of Baby-Making in the New Millennium.
[03:37:20.598 --> 03:37:24.820]  And this person is going to come into play after we play this
[03:37:25.260 --> 03:37:32.166]  Rather long clip of Vivek Ramaswamy giving his answer to my question at a town hall.
[03:37:32.206 --> 03:37:39.451]  And look, I like a lot of what Vivek is doing and I'm very encouraged that he has brought many of these issues to the forefront.
[03:37:40.052 --> 03:37:48.038]  But as always, we should ask relevant questions of everybody out there, especially those that are seeking power.
[03:37:48.898 --> 03:37:50.200]  Thank you for coming out today, guys.
[03:37:50.240 --> 03:37:50.960]  God bless you.
[03:37:52.021 --> 03:37:53.242]  God bless your families.
[03:37:54.125 --> 03:37:57.326]  And may God bless our United States of America.
[03:37:57.346 --> 03:37:58.406]  We're just getting warmed up.
[03:37:58.446 --> 03:38:00.986]  We're going to practice what we preach a little bit.
[03:38:01.026 --> 03:38:03.667]  We're not going to stop in this race till we get this job done.
[03:38:04.047 --> 03:38:04.927]  I want to open this up.
[03:38:05.927 --> 03:38:07.167]  I want to have a conversation.
[03:38:07.207 --> 03:38:08.187]  Take the filters off.
[03:38:09.688 --> 03:38:12.408]  I'm going to sit across the table from Xi Jinping, and I will.
[03:38:13.508 --> 03:38:18.669]  I better be willing to sit across the table from our own fellow citizens in this country.
[03:38:18.729 --> 03:38:20.810]  And so I don't know if we have a microphone.
[03:38:20.830 --> 03:38:21.870]  We got a couple of them.
[03:38:22.490 --> 03:38:23.350]  Let's open this up.
[03:38:24.409 --> 03:38:25.890]  Should I wait for the mic?
[03:38:25.910 --> 03:38:26.830]  I don't necessarily need a mic.
[03:38:26.850 --> 03:38:36.875]  You come from a background in biotech and basically right now we're at a point where United Therapeutics, for instance, has gotten the FDA approval on xenotransplantation.
[03:38:49.673 --> 03:38:52.095]  How far is too far with transhumanism?
[03:38:52.195 --> 03:38:56.558]  And then the head of that company is a person by the name of Martin Rothblatt.
[03:38:56.678 --> 03:38:58.039]  Used to be Martin Rothblatt.
[03:38:58.519 --> 03:39:02.082]  Also the most powerful transgender person on the planet.
[03:39:02.462 --> 03:39:07.666]  They're the author of Virtually Human, Unzipped Genes, and From Transgender to Transhuman.
[03:39:08.026 --> 03:39:12.249]  Now, I see transgenderism as a pathway to transhumanism.
[03:39:12.309 --> 03:39:13.490]  I'd love to get your take on that.
[03:39:13.890 --> 03:39:16.392]  Yeah, I mean, this is, I gotta say, this is the first on the campaign trail.
[03:39:16.512 --> 03:39:17.092]  I like this.
[03:39:17.292 --> 03:39:18.693]  I like going into new territory.
[03:39:19.738 --> 03:39:21.559]  You're right, my background was in developing medicines.
[03:39:21.720 --> 03:39:26.323]  I oversaw the development of a number of medicines, five of which are FDA approved today.
[03:39:27.224 --> 03:39:32.448]  The one I'm most proud of is life-saving therapy in kids, actually.
[03:39:32.468 --> 03:39:37.571]  20 kids a year are born with a genetic disease where 100% of those kids die by the age of three.
[03:39:38.732 --> 03:39:44.957]  I worked on a therapy, I had the honor of working on a therapy where a majority of those kids now live lives of a normal duration.
[03:39:45.538 --> 03:39:53.321]  Another one for prostate cancer, another for endometriosis, and uterine fibroids, women's health conditions that were ignored by much of Big Pharma.
[03:39:53.341 --> 03:39:54.261]  So that was my background.
[03:39:54.801 --> 03:39:59.943]  But I'll actually take you back to the question about the chimera, which is part animal, part human.
[03:40:01.744 --> 03:40:08.947]  My senior thesis in college, actually, in 2007, was about the ethics of creating human-animal chimeras.
[03:40:09.627 --> 03:40:12.008]  And the core conclusion I came to is
[03:40:13.186 --> 03:40:14.607]  And that was at the embryonic stage.
[03:40:14.847 --> 03:40:23.733]  Whenever something assumes the qualities of humanity, that's when it creates fundamental ethical quandaries we don't necessarily want to cross.
[03:40:24.554 --> 03:40:30.898]  And so I think sometimes what's happened is we're pushing the boundaries, not because that's necessary, but for the sake of pushing those boundaries.
[03:40:30.918 --> 03:40:32.559]  And I don't think that that's pro-human.
[03:40:33.480 --> 03:40:40.645]  And whether you're talking about this issue or whether you're talking about even very different issues, like the anti-fossil fuel agenda as it relates to the climate agenda,
[03:40:42.165 --> 03:40:49.310]  I think the question we should be asking isn't, are you measuring carbon dioxide emissions, are you measuring some quality, what percentage of human cells or not?
[03:40:49.350 --> 03:40:53.454]  The question we should be asking is, what advances human prosperity?
[03:40:54.394 --> 03:40:58.037]  What advances American prosperity as an American, but what advances human prosperity?
[03:40:59.349 --> 03:41:03.850]  That's the question we should be asking, and I think that that's what's going to guide us going forward as well.
[03:41:03.870 --> 03:41:12.273]  As it relates to the transgender point, and I think these are, I know the word trans is in both, but I think they're basically two different subjects, but since you brought about it, I think it's worth touching on.
[03:41:12.293 --> 03:41:17.514]  I know this is a little controversial for me to say, but I'm going to share with you my view.
[03:41:17.574 --> 03:41:22.116]  I think that transgenderism, especially in young people, it's a mental health disorder.
[03:41:22.136 --> 03:41:26.877]  It's been treated that way for most of our national history, and I don't think it is compassionate.
[03:41:27.779 --> 03:41:29.720]  To affirm that kid's confusion.
[03:41:30.781 --> 03:41:39.667]  Usually when a young person is saying that, hey, my biological sex doesn't match my gender, what they're really saying is, I need, I need some help.
[03:41:40.268 --> 03:41:41.649]  I'm going through a difficult time.
[03:41:42.149 --> 03:41:44.651]  Figure out, you're allowed to ask what's going wrong.
[03:41:44.751 --> 03:41:47.813]  But today, in today's culture, you're transphobic if you ask that question.
[03:41:48.874 --> 03:41:53.137]  I met two young women in this, I can't speak to the individual you mentioned, but I met
[03:41:53.991 --> 03:41:58.593]  About what the circumstances were or gender conversion or anything else, but I met two young women this race.
[03:41:59.974 --> 03:42:01.015]  They're in their 20s now.
[03:42:01.355 --> 03:42:03.056]  Both of them had double mastectomies.
[03:42:03.836 --> 03:42:04.796]  Both their breasts cut off.
[03:42:04.956 --> 03:42:07.338]  Another one of them had a hysterectomy when they were teenagers.
[03:42:08.118 --> 03:42:09.419]  Now in their 20s they regret it.
[03:42:11.540 --> 03:42:13.461]  I think it's barbaric that we allowed that to happen.
[03:42:14.161 --> 03:42:17.883]  That's not compassion, that is cruelty to affirm a kid's confusion.
[03:42:18.860 --> 03:42:22.383]  And so I think sometimes you have to speak the truth, not just when it's easy, but when it's hard.
[03:42:22.443 --> 03:42:23.944]  There is such a thing as objective truth.
[03:42:23.964 --> 03:42:33.270]  And I think the more we start wavering from our commitment to truth, the more lost we are in that wilderness.
[03:42:34.491 --> 03:42:42.697]  So you see, I think, I mean, as many of you know, I'm Hindu, but I went to a Catholic high school, I can tell you from, and I'm proud of my faith, and I'm happy to talk about that.
[03:42:46.138 --> 03:42:52.820]  But I think that our shared foundational values actually overlap heavily with the Judeo-Christian values this nation was founded on.
[03:42:52.860 --> 03:43:08.943]  But the thing I was going to bring up was actually a reference from the book of Exodus, where when the Israelites are lost in the desert, yet to find the promised land, that's when they say, we want to go back and be ruled by the Pharaoh.
[03:43:10.344 --> 03:43:15.505]  So in some sense, that's what I see in America right now, is we're lost in that wilderness, yet to find a promised land.
[03:43:16.684 --> 03:43:24.746]  When you have a hole the size of God in your heart, another scientist said this actually, Blaise Pascal, if you have a hole the size of God in your heart and God doesn't fill it, something else will instead.
[03:43:25.586 --> 03:43:25.706]  Right?
[03:43:25.726 --> 03:43:28.326]  You don't pledge allegiance to that flag.
[03:43:29.107 --> 03:43:32.007]  You're going to quite literally pledge allegiance to a different flag instead.
[03:43:32.047 --> 03:43:33.528]  That's where the trans flag came from.
[03:43:33.668 --> 03:43:36.308]  It's out of a human need to believe in something bigger than ourselves.
[03:43:36.788 --> 03:43:42.209]  And I think the right way we win is we dilute a lot of that to irrelevance by reviving the real thing.
[03:43:42.409 --> 03:43:44.570]  Individual, family, nation, God.
[03:43:44.997 --> 03:43:45.558]  And as the U.S.
[03:43:45.638 --> 03:43:47.920]  President, my job is to revive our national identity.
[03:43:49.000 --> 03:43:50.442]  I believe that's half the job of the U.S.
[03:43:50.482 --> 03:43:50.902]  President.
[03:43:50.922 --> 03:43:53.785]  Not just policy, but to stand for our national character.
[03:43:54.465 --> 03:43:58.068]  And I think that dilutes a lot of these other temptations to irrelevance.
[03:43:58.128 --> 03:43:59.069]  And so that's where I stand.
[03:43:59.109 --> 03:43:59.950]  Great question, man.
[03:43:59.990 --> 03:44:00.911]  I appreciate you being here.
[03:44:02.153 --> 03:44:04.013]  Well, let's just talk about that for a second.
[03:44:04.434 --> 03:44:10.055]  Now, number one, I'm six years older than Vivek Ramaswamy, but I appreciate the young man comment.
[03:44:10.295 --> 03:44:22.118]  I totally and completely agree that when you do have a hole in your heart, whether it be for God or really humanity in general, when you're looking for something, when you're not
[03:44:22.674 --> 03:44:23.715]  We're good to go!
[03:44:42.446 --> 03:44:47.270]  Let's take it all the way back to xenotransplantation for a moment.
[03:44:47.370 --> 03:44:57.619]  For those that are unfamiliar, United Therapeutics has now gotten the FDA approval, now for some time, maybe close to two years, in which what?
[03:44:59.361 --> 03:45:07.128]  Organs are being developed for different types of failures, whether they be your pancreas, kidney, or even skin.
[03:45:07.188 --> 03:45:07.388]  Now,
[03:45:08.564 --> 03:45:17.634]  I'm all for that which what empowers humanity, in the sense that yes, technology is a double-edged sword.
[03:45:17.654 --> 03:45:18.976]  Now we have to agree on that.
[03:45:19.036 --> 03:45:27.405]  Now, I have not yet read his thesis on chimeras, but the question is, when is it too far?
[03:45:27.545 --> 03:45:28.526]  I would already argue
[03:45:29.315 --> 03:45:37.360]  That this country and many others through black programs have gone much farther than we can now imagine.
[03:45:38.041 --> 03:45:46.967]  I often reference, for instance, Annie Jacobson's book, Area 51, in which her explanation for the Roswell crash
[03:45:47.627 --> 03:45:58.272]  Is that Stalin was able to get a hold of a team of brothers, the quote-unquote Horton Brothers, the people that really brought us the stealth type technology.
[03:45:58.312 --> 03:46:04.095]  They're the ones that invented the flying wing all the way back in the 40s.
[03:46:04.576 --> 03:46:07.357]  And they were able to create quote-unquote UFOs.
[03:46:08.237 --> 03:46:14.479]  She then goes on from her source to say that Stalin was also able to get Mengele.
[03:46:14.499 --> 03:46:30.822]  Well, a lot of these Nazi scientists, you know, the ones that didn't get absorbed into paperclip, absolutely did escape to South America and absolutely even Russia was divvying up who they could get in their own type of paperclip programs.
[03:46:31.343 --> 03:46:32.823]  And she says that
[03:46:33.604 --> 03:46:43.009]  Basically the quote-unquote aliens that we saw were genetically modified humans, ones that were taking that appearance.
[03:46:43.429 --> 03:46:53.254]  Now you can dismiss that, but the response to why we didn't blow the whistle on that and explain it is because quote-unquote we were doing it too.
[03:46:53.354 --> 03:47:00.458]  Now if this has been taking place now for the better part of almost a century, how far are they?
[03:47:00.518 --> 03:47:03.079]  How far have they gone?
[03:47:04.105 --> 03:47:10.650]  And why hasn't the vast majority of humanity benefited from these programs?
[03:47:10.690 --> 03:47:24.701]  Now let's take a look at Martine Rothblai, who owns that company, United Therapeutics, and here's where we're going to make that link a little bit more prevalent and a little bit stronger.
[03:47:25.082 --> 03:47:25.802]  Martine, in 2012,
[03:47:27.802 --> 03:47:31.324]  actually authored this book that we're going to go to right here.
[03:47:31.925 --> 03:47:39.929]  It is From Transgender to Transhuman, A Manifesto on the Freedom of Form.
[03:47:40.830 --> 03:47:45.673]  Now, to Martine Rothblatt, this indeed is a pathway and before
[03:47:46.391 --> 03:47:54.076]  We let Martine talk about transgenderism into transhumanism themselves.
[03:47:54.497 --> 03:47:58.319]  I'd like to point out just some of the outright similarities.
[03:47:58.359 --> 03:48:01.302]  Number one, you are to reject your biology.
[03:48:01.342 --> 03:48:06.165]  That's the biggest thing with this gender movement, is that you are fluid.
[03:48:06.798 --> 03:48:14.201]  And therefore, your identity is no longer based in reality, let alone your biological reality.
[03:48:14.461 --> 03:48:22.664]  They continue, when I say they, I mean the mainstream media, politicians, popular culture, to push a quote-unquote metaverse
[03:48:23.470 --> 03:48:28.355]  Billions upon billions upon billions have been thrust into this system that is being what?
[03:48:28.395 --> 03:48:31.559]  Promoted by the WEF and other globalist organizations.
[03:48:31.839 --> 03:48:34.522]  It has not turned any type of a profit.
[03:48:34.762 --> 03:48:36.424]  People are being fired left and right.
[03:48:36.444 --> 03:48:36.904]  And guess what?
[03:48:37.284 --> 03:48:38.626]  The stock continues to go up.
[03:48:39.212 --> 03:48:40.874]  Because this is part of the plan.
[03:48:40.914 --> 03:48:55.454]  They want you to identify as a leprechaun riding on a unicorn over a rainbow of sunshine and gold, folks, and believing that's closer to reality because they want you to disassociate from what?
[03:48:55.994 --> 03:48:58.656]  Your humanity in general.
[03:48:59.096 --> 03:49:22.248]  And that is why this is so important, because once we no longer have actual biological roles in society, and they tell you you can create your own biology, and you can merge with machines on top of that, and identify as anything in these virtual wonderverses, well, they'll also try to convince you to euthanize yourself and upload your consciousness.
[03:49:22.508 --> 03:49:23.249]  While they
[03:49:24.153 --> 03:49:27.595]  Experiment on us and try to attain what?
[03:49:28.335 --> 03:49:33.278]  Biological, that's biological immortality.
[03:49:33.918 --> 03:49:35.259]  But let's start here.
[03:49:35.479 --> 03:49:48.205]  Let's go to the Transformers Conference with Martine Rothblatt, kind of joking about their role in this LGBTQ movement and community.
[03:49:48.826 --> 03:50:08.996]  ...but is also the recipient of this year's Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative Award, which is devoted to LBGT issues, and puts her in an interesting issue because she has a company, or part of the company is based in North Carolina, which, as you know right now, she might get arrested for going to the bathroom if the governor had anything to do about it.
[03:50:10.196 --> 03:50:11.817]  Ladies and gentlemen, Martine Rothblatt.
[03:50:19.040 --> 03:50:25.227]  Martin, one of the basic concepts that you're interested in, it's not just improving life, but it's actually immortality.
[03:50:25.687 --> 03:50:27.028]  That we're all going to live forever.
[03:50:27.189 --> 03:50:31.253]  And Martin, I might mention, has founded a religion, as one does.
[03:50:34.346 --> 03:50:35.106]  I think so.
[03:50:51.172 --> 03:50:52.793]  Well, think about what was just said there.
[03:50:53.053 --> 03:51:15.861]  Terrasim is a real thing, and it is also predicated on Martine Rothblatt digitally duplicating, creating a digital doppelganger, which Martine will get into, of their wife, which they stayed with, and creating a automated robot that hopefully one day, in their vision, will pass the Turing test called BINA48.
[03:51:16.041 --> 03:51:16.861]  But let's continue.
[03:51:16.881 --> 03:51:16.961]  Idea.
[03:51:19.062 --> 03:51:22.083]  That we're not just going to live a long time, but we're all going to live forever.
[03:51:22.583 --> 03:51:25.643]  Tell us your concept of immortality and how that actually would work.
[03:51:26.503 --> 03:51:27.424]  Thanks, Nealey.
[03:51:27.564 --> 03:51:29.324]  It's a great pleasure to be here.
[03:51:30.484 --> 03:51:38.106]  The idea is one that has been percolating up from lots of people in the information technology industry for a while.
[03:51:39.106 --> 03:51:45.667]  Perhaps Ray Kurzweil, who is a prolific inventor, is best known for the idea.
[03:51:46.641 --> 03:52:11.208]  That as our abilities in the information processing industry, computer software, storage of more and more of our thoughts and our ideas outside of our body becomes easier, more automatic, less expensive, that ultimately we're going to have sort of digital doppelgangers of ourselves.
[03:52:11.809 --> 03:52:12.129]  Thank you.
[03:52:28.217 --> 03:52:35.665]  Work to make the software that runs these digital doppelgangers ever more lifelike, ever more human-like.
[03:52:36.125 --> 03:52:48.958]  They'll come sort of a tipping point when people begin to claim that these digital doppelgangers have achieved what we call consciousness, an ability to have a sense of themselves, hopes, fears, and feelings.
[03:52:49.931 --> 03:53:02.006]  And at that point, I think the activity will move to the legal arena as to whether or not these digital doppelgangers really are conscious, really do have an independent legal identity.
[03:53:02.947 --> 03:53:08.955]  And kind of the trend of progressive thinking is once there's a scientific consensus,
[03:53:09.745 --> 03:53:20.193]  And in this case, it would be the science of psychology, that being the science of the mind, that these digital doppelgangers are in fact cyber conscious.
[03:53:21.334 --> 03:53:36.105]  Then they'll begin to acquire the sorts of rights and protections that we assign to even our pets, laboratory animals, and to quite a high extent to primates like chimpanzees.
[03:53:36.852 --> 03:53:44.989]  And so in this way, ourselves will kind of morph into a sort of digital consciousness that is recognized by the law.
[03:53:46.244 --> 03:53:52.148]  A digital consciousness that is recognized by the law, but don't think that they're going to stop there.
[03:53:52.188 --> 03:54:12.442]  At this same conference, again, this is all the way back in 2016, an individual who has already gone through some of the most bizarre transhumanist surgery that I've ever seen, Neil Harbison, talks about how, well, you can become trans species and just like
[03:54:13.770 --> 03:54:20.937]  Uh, these transgender operations were going on in the forties and fifties and sixties underground and became more mainstream.
[03:54:21.237 --> 03:54:22.058]  This will as well.
[03:54:22.757 --> 03:54:24.157]  Have but that humans don't have.
[03:54:24.217 --> 03:54:28.619]  So we are in a stage in history that we can actually design what species we want to be.
[03:54:28.999 --> 03:54:33.920]  I consider myself a trans species because I'm adding senses and organs that other species have.
[03:54:34.380 --> 03:54:38.622]  And you can add many many more senses that other species have and organs that other species have.
[03:54:39.002 --> 03:54:41.482]  And we'll start seeing this in the 20s because it's now growing.
[03:54:41.502 --> 03:54:42.743]  It's happening underground.
[03:54:42.763 --> 03:54:43.403]  There's already
[03:54:43.903 --> 03:54:45.304]  In the end, we will just all accept it.
[03:55:09.013 --> 03:55:12.880]  That's what is absolutely going on right now.
[03:55:12.960 --> 03:55:15.224]  And it's not a slow crawl anymore.
[03:55:15.902 --> 03:55:23.084]  All right, the movement into digital currency into block chain slavery.
[03:55:23.304 --> 03:55:25.045]  Look, I'm not against Bitcoin.
[03:55:25.105 --> 03:55:27.526]  I saw Max Keiser on here earlier in the week.
[03:55:27.626 --> 03:55:29.746]  I'm interested in El Salvador.
[03:55:29.826 --> 03:55:32.367]  I'm interested in decentralization.
[03:55:32.427 --> 03:55:33.307]  But guess what?
[03:55:33.827 --> 03:55:41.470]  The block chain has already been utilized by what the IMF and the World Bank to create block chain people.
[03:55:41.490 --> 03:55:45.491]  We got just just enough time to show you this video as well.
[03:55:47.862 --> 03:55:51.705]  So this is a refugee camp that's running on the blockchain, everybody.
[03:55:52.485 --> 03:55:57.109]  And, uh, basically, uh, you have your biometrics scanned into cameras.
[03:55:57.129 --> 03:55:59.590]  This was beta tested during the War of Terror.
[03:55:59.811 --> 03:56:02.553]  And now you're in the World Food Program account.
[03:56:02.613 --> 03:56:05.795]  And don't worry, they're gonna find you all work while you what?
[03:56:06.551 --> 03:56:10.075]  Sleep on the ground and have your identity confirmed.
[03:56:10.115 --> 03:56:12.437]  It has all your different types of records.
[03:56:12.477 --> 03:56:15.901]  Your passports, your exam certificates, and your financial history.
[03:56:15.941 --> 03:56:18.224]  Not to mention your biological information.
[03:56:18.284 --> 03:56:20.906]  And more areas than ever are being destroyed.
[03:56:21.187 --> 03:56:23.429]  So hey, this will go on right now.
[03:56:23.669 --> 03:56:27.073]  And don't worry, it's going to cut out a lot of those banking transaction fees.
[03:56:27.673 --> 03:56:33.638]  So blockchain people are a reality right now.
[03:56:33.698 --> 03:56:35.460]  And that's what blockchain people look like.
[03:56:35.540 --> 03:56:36.341]  Take a hard look.
[03:56:36.641 --> 03:56:41.024]  No need for cash or a bank account or owning anything.
[03:56:41.064 --> 03:56:41.665]  You'll own.
[03:56:41.845 --> 03:56:46.809]  This is literally from the same people that told you you will own nothing and be happy.
[03:56:47.209 --> 03:56:56.017]  See how happy you're going to be on the ground in a refugee camp with your biometrics being scanned and the promise of digital immortality?
[03:56:56.597 --> 03:56:58.299]  Give me a break, folks.
[03:56:58.379 --> 03:57:00.540]  It's Team Humanity over here.
[03:57:00.560 --> 03:57:05.224]  I want to thank you and I want to thank Alex Jones for giving me the opportunity to do the fourth hour.
[03:57:05.244 --> 03:57:10.348]  I will be back, I guess, tomorrow to discuss the Epstein case in much more depth.
[03:57:10.428 --> 03:57:17.734]  And folks, I promise you, I'm going to have a lot more articles, a lot more slides, a lot more information than we even went over today.
[03:57:17.774 --> 03:57:20.356]  That's why InfoWars.com is
[03:57:21.036 --> 03:57:28.961]  The most, if not one of the most, probably the most important media outlet out there, at least of my generation.
[03:57:29.001 --> 03:57:33.183]  So please consider supporting it over at InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:57:37.806 --> 03:57:39.167]  It's always about right and wrong.
[03:57:39.267 --> 03:57:40.828]  I absolutely love you guys.
[03:57:40.848 --> 03:57:44.770]  You can check me out on the flip side over at AntNews.us.
[03:57:44.830 --> 03:57:45.511]  Thanks for having me.
[03:57:47.093 --> 03:57:50.814]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[03:57:51.155 --> 03:57:54.316]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[03:57:54.716 --> 03:57:59.177]  Because they can't get through this giant megamaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[03:57:59.798 --> 03:58:01.938]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[03:58:02.239 --> 03:58:02.959]  In my new book,
[03:58:03.499 --> 03:58:06.681]  We give you the solutions to build a new, better world.
[03:58:07.161 --> 03:58:10.222]  An alternative to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs.
[03:58:10.843 --> 03:58:12.183]  This is The Great Awakening.
[03:58:12.684 --> 03:58:16.586]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[03:58:17.066 --> 03:58:18.547]  It's a companion to my last book.
[03:58:18.847 --> 03:58:20.608]  It was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[03:58:20.868 --> 03:58:23.329]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.

[03:58:51.443 --> 03:58:56.145]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at mfullmorestore.com.
[03:58:56.685 --> 03:59:08.609]  They are both clones of national best-selling products from a major pharmaceutical slash supplement maker that are listeners and patriots that are allowing us to private label it at a lower price you'll find in stores.
[03:59:09.029 --> 03:59:12.210]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[03:59:13.010 --> 03:59:25.594]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain and also make your nerves healthier, which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more inductive to pain.
[03:59:26.054 --> 03:59:28.055]  There's major research behind this all.
[03:59:28.335 --> 03:59:32.416]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from InfoWarsMD and Nerve
[03:59:32.896 --> 03:59:33.577]  We're good to go.
