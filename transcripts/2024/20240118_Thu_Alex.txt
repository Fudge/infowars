[00:00:07.082 --> 00:00:17.464]  In December of 2020, federal agents Lindsey and Ura approached Mr. Jeremy Brown at his home and asked him if he would be a paid informant for the government.
[00:00:17.844 --> 00:00:25.006]  They asked him to infiltrate some groups they were looking at involving concerns they had about an event in January.
[00:00:25.346 --> 00:00:30.607]  Mr. Brown recorded this conversation and instead of working for the government on January 6th.
[00:00:31.347 --> 00:00:39.011]  He went on as many media outlets that would have him starting in March of 2021 and played the recording.
[00:00:39.431 --> 00:00:43.113]  He named the agents and exposed what they wanted him to do.
[00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:45.334]  So it's no big deal.
[00:00:45.455 --> 00:00:46.495]  We decided to come out.
[00:00:46.675 --> 00:00:48.576]  I've worked with JTF before.
[00:00:48.656 --> 00:00:50.757]  I'm not in the future.
[00:00:51.578 --> 00:00:52.418]  So see there you have it.
[00:00:52.878 --> 00:00:54.059]  Well, you might in the future.
[00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:55.840]  So we don't care between me.
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.240]  Right.
[00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.661]  I just want to make here that
[00:00:58.323 --> 00:01:22.327]  You're not hard you need buddy and nobody get hurt over the out to hear from you and again I'm not I can't you promises but you provide information that something government we think that we can help this side less aggregation your one of 19 people I will I will I will I will I will I will I will I will I will I will I will I will I will I will I will I will
[00:01:26.705 --> 00:01:34.487]  Not the 58 other agents that he's about to explain that there's 60 of them in Tampa, but I'm just one of 19.
[00:01:35.748 --> 00:01:43.070]  As a result of his righteous actions, the government had arrested after an illegal search of his home on September of 2021.
[00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.236]  And after nearly two and a half years in federal prison, Jeremy is filed for an appeal.
[00:01:50.777 --> 00:02:02.891]  Jeremy's legal team is presenting forensic evidence that show the unregistered explosive grenades and the national defense documents that Jeremy was said to have illegally been in possession of.
[00:02:03.451 --> 00:02:07.912]  We're planted in his home by government agents during an illegal search.
[00:02:08.693 --> 00:02:16.015]  The first thing the agents did when they entered Mr. Brown's home for their search was turn off all 14 recording devices.
[00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:19.676]  And none of these agents had any functioning body cameras.
[00:02:20.076 --> 00:02:29.759]  The only person recording was Jeremy's girlfriend who recorded the arrest by agent Lindsay and Ura who instructed her to stop recording which she did.
[00:02:30.563 --> 00:02:34.767]  They were very deliberate in making sure nothing was recorded during their search.
[00:02:35.548 --> 00:02:43.035]  During this search, they allegedly found two explosive grenades and a CD containing national defense documents.
[00:02:43.576 --> 00:02:46.638]  Items that Mr. Brown denied knowing anything about.
[00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:57.641]  The grenades were tested for DNA, and the FBI's own experts found two male specimen DNAs on the grenades, none of which were from Jeremy Brown.
[00:02:58.442 --> 00:03:01.222]  They found a dog hair underneath one of the grenades.
[00:03:01.582 --> 00:03:11.925]  Mr. Brown has two dogs, so the FBI got a search warrant, took over 50 samples from his dogs, and determined that the hair on the grenade was not from his dogs.
[00:03:12.785 --> 00:03:17.029]  They found a carpet fiber on the tape around one of the grenades.
[00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.011]  So they get another search warrant.
[00:03:19.291 --> 00:03:24.416]  Cut out pieces of Jeremy's carpet and compare the fibers to the one that was found with the grenade.
[00:03:25.097 --> 00:03:27.219]  And they determine it was not a match.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:41.887]  Criminal counts 6, 7, 8, and 9 were allegedly found on a compact disc that they claim Mr. Brown carried with him through the deserts of Kuwait and Afghanistan for 17 years.
[00:03:42.568 --> 00:03:46.230]  And yet, there isn't a scratch or a hint of discoloration on it.
[00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.695]  In August of 2022, there was a trace done on that CD to see when it was uploaded.
[00:03:53.116 --> 00:03:59.661]  And the evidence shows that Mr. Brown did not have the CD or the two grenades in his possession.
[00:04:00.162 --> 00:04:14.554]  They were planted by crooked agents working for a criminal state that has locked up and tortured scores of innocent men and women for a planned false flag event that they orchestrated with so many federal assets that they lost count.
[00:04:15.114 --> 00:04:20.456]  This criminal state is now threatening to go after everyone who was in Washington D.C.
[00:04:20.716 --> 00:04:21.877]  on January 6th.
[00:04:22.337 --> 00:04:25.778]  No matter if they were in the Capitol or on Capitol grounds.
[00:04:26.619 --> 00:04:36.743]  While we are still somewhat free, let us support Jeremy Brown in his legal efforts so that he can free himself and continue to fight for American freedom.
[00:04:37.663 --> 00:04:38.884]  Greg Reese reporting.
[00:04:41.926 --> 00:04:46.056]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we're live Thursday, January 18th, 2024.
[00:04:46.417 --> 00:04:47.941]  Huge transmission lined up for you.
[00:04:48.001 --> 00:04:49.164]  Please stay with us.
[00:05:00.188 --> 00:05:02.431]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[00:05:02.451 --> 00:05:02.971]  Thank you.
[00:05:03.172 --> 00:05:05.735]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[00:05:05.795 --> 00:05:07.056]  I started taking that stuff.
[00:05:07.096 --> 00:05:10.280]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.301]  When did you start taking it?
[00:05:11.582 --> 00:05:15.546]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[00:05:16.187 --> 00:05:18.889]  And I started eating a little better, but my blood pressure stayed high.
[00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:26.434]  And when I took X2 iodine, after about two or four weeks, I think my body was detoxified of a bunch of metals and stuff that my body was storing.
[00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:28.736]  And my blood pressure came down to perfect level.
[00:05:29.136 --> 00:05:32.078]  And I tell people the only thing I did was X2 iodine.
[00:05:32.518 --> 00:05:46.404]  And even though I do think all your other products are good, I recommend to anybody that they start with X2 iodine because it detoxifies your body and kind of kicks your natural DNA into full force.
[00:05:46.484 --> 00:05:49.945]  So, in my life, I found X2 iodine to be best.
[00:05:50.425 --> 00:05:53.867]  I tried other iodines and they didn't have the same effect.
[00:05:54.167 --> 00:05:56.468]  So, X2 iodine, I really wanted to point that out.
[00:06:11.064 --> 00:06:11.705]  Big Brother.
[00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:13.465]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:14.025 --> 00:06:15.146]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:15.906 --> 00:06:17.367]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:17.607 --> 00:06:18.747]  Well so does he.
[00:06:19.267 --> 00:06:22.228]  Live from the Infowars.com Studios.
[00:06:22.608 --> 00:06:23.969]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:34.985 --> 00:06:39.651]  Wow, we have got an incredible transmission lined up for you today.
[00:06:40.051 --> 00:06:42.975]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown on World Events joins us in about 25 minutes.
[00:06:44.667 --> 00:06:44.907]  I think?
[00:06:44.947 --> 00:06:45.087]  I think?
[00:06:45.187 --> 00:06:45.388]  I think?
[00:06:45.408 --> 00:06:45.668]  I think?
[00:06:45.688 --> 00:06:46.448]  I think?
[00:06:46.568 --> 00:06:46.889]  I think?
[00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:47.129]  I think?
[00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:47.529]  I think?
[00:06:47.549 --> 00:06:47.709]  I think?
[00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:47.889]  I think?
[00:07:14.465 --> 00:07:24.608]  We've seen Sweden, we've seen the UK, we've seen all the documents and statements come out that they think war, full war with Russia is imminent with no evidence of that.
[00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:35.031]  Now NATO prepares for Putin, 90,000 troops are called up to the agency's largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War.
[00:07:36.652 --> 00:07:41.153]  The French government officially says war is good, it will benefit the people and the economy.
[00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:55.173]  Ukraine on break of coups, Zelensky's country to ruin, former speaker of the House, throws cold water on Ukraine funding, prioritizing border security.
[00:07:55.913 --> 00:08:00.554]  So that's something good that the House speaker is doing.
[00:08:02.655 --> 00:08:05.616]  And so much more on that front.
[00:08:07.267 --> 00:08:10.971]  Globus panic as Trump vows to block central bank digital currencies.
[00:08:11.031 --> 00:08:14.395]  Refused to give government absolute control over your money and tyranny.
[00:08:15.536 --> 00:08:16.217]  Huge news.
[00:08:17.678 --> 00:08:18.379]  DHS.
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.261]  Secretly paid.
[00:08:20.802 --> 00:08:24.566]  Massive amounts of money to create counter propaganda against Trump and conservatives.
[00:08:25.106 --> 00:08:26.128]  Totally illegal.
[00:08:26.168 --> 00:08:27.069]  We're gonna be getting to that.
[00:08:27.981 --> 00:08:40.630]  We've got all the big WEF developments, with Argentina's new president Javier Mili slamming globalist on stage to their faces, even more hardcore than what Elon Musk did last year.
[00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:49.456]  Elon Musk attacked the WEF quote overlords, says how dare them try to take control of our society.
[00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:56.921]  US News & World Report reports cancer exploding since the advent of the so-called COVID vaccine.
[00:08:58.527 --> 00:08:59.568]  There is so much more.
[00:08:59.908 --> 00:09:06.092]  California moves to ban football, youth football, total nanny state.
[00:09:07.513 --> 00:09:15.598]  Feds are now moving in as we speak supposedly to displace state militia, the state national guard from Eagle Pass.
[00:09:15.618 --> 00:09:16.538]  We'll be tracking that.
[00:09:17.119 --> 00:09:23.603]  Also it's beginning Texas troopers beginning to arrest smugglers right in front of the Feds.
[00:09:24.163 --> 00:09:27.225]  So it's happening with state charges.
[00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:30.972]  So at least a little bit of defense is starting to be put up.
[00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:32.493]  There is so much more.
[00:09:34.695 --> 00:09:36.956]  We're going to be breaking down here today.
[00:09:38.117 --> 00:09:46.864]  But the first thing I wanted to hit just illustrates the panic, the raw hysteria out of the Democratic Party.
[00:09:47.764 --> 00:09:49.766]  This morning, the top of drudge report
[00:09:51.092 --> 00:09:53.453]  It's just been taken off because it obviously blew up in their face.
[00:09:54.093 --> 00:09:57.035]  Was Trump has syphus, or does Trump have syphus?
[00:09:57.735 --> 00:09:59.156]  We'll show you a screenshot of that in a moment.
[00:09:59.216 --> 00:10:13.642]  I shot a special report this morning that just went live on X. And the instant I looked at it, it's his right hand, it's his index finger, his thumb, and some of the pads on his, you know, the top of the pad of his hand, the palm.
[00:10:15.071 --> 00:10:19.134]  I didn't play a lot of golf, but I've probably played 200, 300 rounds in my life.
[00:10:19.194 --> 00:10:21.456]  I was pretty good at it, but I never really had time to do it.
[00:10:21.496 --> 00:10:22.717]  I grew up on a golf course.
[00:10:23.598 --> 00:10:24.539]  And so I played from the time.
[00:10:24.559 --> 00:10:26.040]  I was about 8 to about 16.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.541]  It's got too busy with life.
[00:10:28.142 --> 00:10:30.284]  Too busy chasing girls quite frankly want to play golf.
[00:10:30.324 --> 00:10:30.944]  It's a great sport.
[00:10:30.984 --> 00:10:31.244]  Love it.
[00:10:32.205 --> 00:10:33.626]  I think it's really good for people.
[00:10:33.686 --> 00:10:34.347]  It's enjoyable.
[00:10:34.367 --> 00:10:37.790]  And it's just about individuals going out there and just enjoying nature.
[00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:42.393]  It's a way to forest bathe and be out God's creation and kind of zone out.
[00:10:43.254 --> 00:10:46.775]  But Trump is a top scratch player, in many ways they say he's a professional.
[00:10:47.335 --> 00:10:49.076]  When he was a young man, he could have been a professional.
[00:10:49.996 --> 00:10:55.257]  And so what the Democrats did, I found the actual photo is, they posterized it to make his hand look even whiter.
[00:10:56.578 --> 00:11:02.559]  So that the bloody calluses on his hand, clearly from golfer's rash, would look like syphus.
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:03.960]  And
[00:11:05.359 --> 00:11:18.726]  If you go to any golf course and just walk up, a lot of the golfers are going to have tape on their hands, they're going to have body marks on their hands, especially of their big golfers, like Trump who is known to play two 18 rounds a day sometimes, but almost every day 18 holes.
[00:11:19.607 --> 00:11:32.174]  So that's a classic golfers rash, and they're trying to make that the big story because they have nothing, because rig court saying rape women with no evidence.
[00:11:33.609 --> 00:11:35.570]  And then he's found guilty for saying he's innocent.
[00:11:36.291 --> 00:11:39.473]  And the other kangaroo courts with no juries in New York and the rest of it.
[00:11:40.214 --> 00:11:46.518]  And Fanny Willis and what's happening in George's it's discovered that she's a complete in total criminals we broke months ago.
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.222]  None of it's working so now they're moving to total desperation.
[00:11:53.523 --> 00:11:57.326]  Few weeks ago is that Trump was pooping his pants know that's Joe Biden.
[00:11:57.986 --> 00:12:02.049]  Now it's that he's got syphos just incredible desperation here it is.
[00:12:03.886 --> 00:12:10.696]  If you go to the Drudge Report, and I think it'll still be up, there's a story that talks about Trump having hand cuts.
[00:12:11.257 --> 00:12:12.179]  And you can link to it.
[00:12:12.359 --> 00:12:14.202]  They don't look like cuts to me.
[00:12:15.143 --> 00:12:16.084]  They look like sores.
[00:12:17.177 --> 00:12:23.460]  And I've asked a number of MDs what medical condition manifests itself through hand sores.
[00:12:24.101 --> 00:12:26.662]  And the answer is immediate and unanimous.
[00:12:27.202 --> 00:12:28.383]  Secondary syphilis.
[00:12:29.223 --> 00:12:32.305]  All right, I think there's a good chance this man has the clap.
[00:12:32.905 --> 00:12:35.407]  And I'm not being particularly secretive about it.
[00:12:36.107 --> 00:12:38.248]  I am texting the photo.
[00:12:38.528 --> 00:12:45.112]  You can link to it in some operation called a daily mail or some British thing, probably a Fleet Street ride.
[00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:57.138]  You know, maybe the picture's doctored or whatever, but maybe this story goes somewhere, maybe it won't, but I'm telling you at 1 o'clock Eastern, I'm humping this thing like a young doll on old furniture.
[00:12:57.779 --> 00:12:59.480]  Golfers Vasculitis.
[00:13:00.101 --> 00:13:01.442]  That's what Trump has.
[00:13:02.542 --> 00:13:09.728]  And we see desperate Democrat Party operative, James Carvel, putting out videos in Drudge Report and others picking it up.
[00:13:09.988 --> 00:13:11.469]  Does Trump have syphus?
[00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:13.791]  The instant I saw his hand,
[00:13:14.557 --> 00:13:15.157]  We're good to go.
[00:13:29.861 --> 00:13:56.800]  If you're around off course walker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker talker
[00:13:57.443 --> 00:13:58.044]  Do that twice.
[00:13:58.444 --> 00:14:01.367]  He is a top scratch golfer, almost professional.
[00:14:01.728 --> 00:14:03.169]  And this isn't about even defending Trump.
[00:14:03.209 --> 00:14:05.452]  It's about defending reality.
[00:14:05.472 --> 00:14:06.473]  And I am sick of it.
[00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:08.455]  These people are so desperate.
[00:14:09.136 --> 00:14:15.923]  They've got all these kangaroo courts, rigged events, trials without juries, all the indictments.
[00:14:16.524 --> 00:14:17.505]  He's a Russian spy.
[00:14:17.585 --> 00:14:18.526]  Women are peeing on him.
[00:14:19.227 --> 00:14:20.628]  None of it's true, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:20.648 --> 00:14:22.448]  And none of the things they've said about me are true either.
[00:14:22.748 --> 00:14:25.129]  They're a lying pack of scum.
[00:14:25.169 --> 00:14:26.930]  And Carvel has no shame.
[00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.291]  President Trump is a golfer.
[00:14:29.671 --> 00:14:31.292]  It's his golfing hand.
[00:14:31.772 --> 00:14:33.933]  The one that grips down the furthest is the right hand.
[00:14:34.333 --> 00:14:35.694]  That's where you tend to get it.
[00:14:36.094 --> 00:14:36.974]  Everybody knows it.
[00:14:37.214 --> 00:14:39.055]  He doesn't have syphilis.
[00:14:40.416 --> 00:14:44.237]  All right, I'll be covering this live today at 11 AM Central Infowars.com 4 Slash Show!
[00:14:44.257 --> 00:14:46.238]  And follow me at Real Alex Jones here on X.
[00:14:49.011 --> 00:15:01.983]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:15:02.464 --> 00:15:06.668]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[00:15:09.284 --> 00:15:14.147]  And a lot of viewers watching on TV, we're on a lot of talk radio stations as well, so we have a lot of links and URLs up there.
[00:15:14.787 --> 00:15:19.490]  That's because for the last five years we've been banned everywhere but Infowars.com and radio and TV stations.
[00:15:20.331 --> 00:15:21.331]  And through your word of mouth.
[00:15:21.371 --> 00:15:35.760]  But now that we're back on X and so many other places are now being flooded with our information, people watching to know, hey, come to the source and see the full live show and the other great broadcast of Owen Schroyer and Harrison Smith and Chase Geyser and the rest of the crew.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.342]  At Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:15:38.863 --> 00:15:43.568]  But Democrats, there's the tweet on X. Democrats are beyond desperate.
[00:15:44.249 --> 00:15:45.911]  Cause of Trump's hand rash discovered.
[00:15:45.991 --> 00:15:47.333]  It's not syphilis.
[00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:51.017]  And you can say, well, why are we even fighting back against these lies?
[00:15:51.137 --> 00:15:54.361]  Because it shows that they are a pack of liars.
[00:15:54.401 --> 00:15:56.904]  Now, let's talk about why they're so angry at Trump.
[00:15:58.939 --> 00:16:03.482]  He cares about sovereignty and independence and doesn't want the global state control of our country.
[00:16:03.842 --> 00:16:26.138]  Whether it's the UN trees or the central banking currencies and he has said that he will stop in central banking currency being deployed in the United States well that's good because the Federal Reserve is rolling in out in June here in the United States the you has already rolled about communist China has had it for 5 years.
[00:16:28.012 --> 00:16:38.642]  Also, since everybody's obsessed with scratches or cuts on political figures, I was cleaning out the garage yesterday and getting down some of the BB guns that are all dusty and dirty and some of the little metal targets.
[00:16:39.083 --> 00:16:43.507]  My daughter wants to shoot some BB guns again and forgot that a rock hammer was up on the top shelf.
[00:16:43.827 --> 00:16:44.988]  So when I pulled the BB guns down,
[00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:56.697]  Boom, got hit in the head with a rock hammer, didn't do much of a bruise, turned my head quickly into some boxes and got a paper cut there on the edge of a box on my face.
[00:16:56.757 --> 00:16:59.479]  Not a cat scratch, not a vampire bite.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:07.504]  That is what happens when you hurriedly throw a rock hammer, which my six and a half year old daughter and other children also love.
[00:17:07.865 --> 00:17:09.846]  We like to go into the creek beds and things.
[00:17:09.866 --> 00:17:13.589]  She's got a little rock hammer, I've got a big one and we find these amazing fossils.
[00:17:14.509 --> 00:17:16.830]  And, uh, that's what happened, but that's a side issue.
[00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:19.011]  It's, uh, not syphus either, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:19.031 --> 00:17:21.172]  It's a rock hammer hitting me in the head.
[00:17:21.812 --> 00:17:24.093]  Uh, I was like, what the hell's that?
[00:17:24.113 --> 00:17:24.753]  It's like a cartoon.
[00:17:24.773 --> 00:17:25.714]  It's like, oh, it's a hammer.
[00:17:26.234 --> 00:17:31.156]  All the things that stick up on top of shelf and then pull down the, uh, BB guns that were inside cases.
[00:17:31.976 --> 00:17:32.297]  Crazy.
[00:17:33.197 --> 00:17:34.377]  But I am digressing.
[00:17:34.397 --> 00:17:40.240]  Uh, here is Trump yesterday talking about how he will stand against the central bank digital currency.
[00:17:42.463 --> 00:17:48.166]  And tonight I'm also making another promise to protect Americans from government tyranny as your president.
[00:17:48.607 --> 00:17:52.709]  I will never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency.
[00:17:56.911 --> 00:18:02.935]  Here's another club from the same speech where he talks about how to engage in disinformation and misinformation.
[00:18:02.955 --> 00:18:03.295]  Here it is.
[00:18:04.602 --> 00:18:11.144]  The Radical Left Democrats are supporting Nikki Haley because they know she's much easier to beat than Trump.
[00:18:11.404 --> 00:18:11.984]  And you know what?
[00:18:12.124 --> 00:18:13.804]  If she weren't, they wouldn't be doing it.
[00:18:14.144 --> 00:18:16.165]  But you know, they're great disinformation people.
[00:18:16.265 --> 00:18:18.546]  Misinformation, disinformation.
[00:18:18.566 --> 00:18:20.366]  You know, they're almost the same, but not quite.
[00:18:20.926 --> 00:18:22.947]  But let's not go into definitions right now.
[00:18:23.507 --> 00:18:24.647]  They're very close, actually.
[00:18:24.667 --> 00:18:28.208]  A lot of people still don't understand it, but I give them credit for both.
[00:18:28.808 --> 00:18:31.969]  But they are, they are literally, what they're doing is they're...
[00:18:32.569 --> 00:18:36.150]  They will say we want to run against Trump so bad.
[00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:38.851]  In the meantime, they're sending all their people to vote for Nikki Haley.
[00:18:38.891 --> 00:18:42.091]  The reason they do that is they want to run against Nikki Haley.
[00:18:42.591 --> 00:18:45.312]  Usually, when they say something, it's the opposite, okay?
[00:18:45.952 --> 00:18:47.113]  And they're very good attitude.
[00:18:47.153 --> 00:18:49.353]  They're good at cheating and elections and disinformation.
[00:18:50.413 --> 00:18:51.274]  Absolutely, they are.
[00:18:51.414 --> 00:18:53.374]  And they're caught and people know the scam now.
[00:18:53.874 --> 00:18:56.355]  Now, before I get into the other news, there's a lot today.
[00:18:56.375 --> 00:18:57.495]  We're going to talk over there.
[00:18:58.315 --> 00:19:00.556]  I want to talk about our enemy.
[00:19:02.071 --> 00:19:06.613]  And I think what I should do next is, in fact, I'm going to probably do this today, and I'll air it tomorrow.
[00:19:07.293 --> 00:19:14.575]  I'm going to put a compilation together of world leaders calling for bringing the world population down to 500 million, or even lower.
[00:19:15.496 --> 00:19:23.158]  I mean, I've got King Charles saying, and I've got Gene Goodall saying, and I've got Klaus Schwab saying, and I've got Bill Gates saying, and I've got them all saying it.
[00:19:24.439 --> 00:19:27.880]  But there's a new one here that I thought we would play.
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:29.440]  That's from Rebel News.
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:30.401]  This is going on at Davos.
[00:19:30.421 --> 00:19:31.161]  This happened yesterday.
[00:19:32.557 --> 00:19:37.941]  Watch the most ridiculous 75 seconds of BS from a Davos yet on Echo side.
[00:19:39.242 --> 00:19:43.686]  And this lady we're about to play, looks like she's never missed a meal.
[00:19:44.747 --> 00:19:54.614]  And her life explains with no sense of irony or shame, well she's in a luxury compound, pulling in a private jet, that's farming the land, fishing for food, and worse, still making money.
[00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:57.569]  It's now a part with mass murder and genocide.
[00:19:57.609 --> 00:19:59.490]  I want to put the farmers in jail.
[00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:09.032]  That's Jojo method founder stop ecocide now explains in our upper class English accent to our ultra rich peers at the Debo script.
[00:20:09.592 --> 00:20:10.332]  It's war.
[00:20:10.473 --> 00:20:11.253]  It's feudalism.
[00:20:11.373 --> 00:20:12.093]  It's siege.
[00:20:12.653 --> 00:20:13.913]  Cutting off your resources.
[00:20:13.993 --> 00:20:16.214]  Cutting off the fertilizer of the plants that we then eat.
[00:20:17.017 --> 00:20:17.497]  We're good to go.
[00:20:47.598 --> 00:20:49.362]  They're literally cutting off the resources.
[00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:50.063]  Here she is.
[00:20:51.118 --> 00:20:59.363]  I mean, ecocide as a word is becoming more, it's becoming better known around the world and the concept is generally mass damage and destruction of nature.
[00:21:00.143 --> 00:21:08.428]  But legally speaking, what our organization and other collaborators aim to do is to have this recognized legally as a serious crime.
[00:21:08.448 --> 00:21:20.736]  Because one of the issues that sort of pervades all of this discussion is that we have a kind of cultural very grained habit of not taking damage to nature as seriously as we take damage to people and property.
[00:21:21.536 --> 00:21:27.597]  And that's, I mean, if you're campaigning for human rights, at least you know mass murder, torture, all of these things are serious crimes.
[00:21:28.137 --> 00:21:30.498]  But there's no equivalent in the environmental space.
[00:21:31.538 --> 00:21:46.281]  And so, and, you know, unlike an international crime like genocide that involves a specific intent, with ecocide what we see is actually what people are trying to do, what businesses are trying to do, is make money, is, you know, is farm, is
[00:21:46.681 --> 00:21:47.963]  We need to eat less meat.
[00:21:47.983 --> 00:21:48.203]  We need to
[00:22:04.224 --> 00:22:05.425]  Which was 450 million people.
[00:22:05.465 --> 00:22:05.505]  So...
[00:22:35.774 --> 00:22:43.779]  The most dirty technologies are the electric cars, the lithium mines, the cobalt mines, where you see literal slaves, mining it for the big UN control companies.
[00:22:44.179 --> 00:22:45.300]  But that's all okay.
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.821]  But an evil farmer, you can type in the headline.
[00:22:48.662 --> 00:22:51.504]  WEF says organic farming needs to be outlawed.
[00:22:51.584 --> 00:22:52.584]  Organic farming is the worst.
[00:22:53.545 --> 00:22:54.806]  Total crap.
[00:22:54.886 --> 00:22:59.328]  They want to shut everything down and have giant factory farms and slave labor.
[00:22:59.368 --> 00:23:03.351]  These people are beyond monsters and they're out in the open.
[00:23:04.375 --> 00:23:05.035]  I think?
[00:23:05.055 --> 00:23:05.336]  I think?
[00:23:05.476 --> 00:23:05.856]  I think?
[00:23:05.876 --> 00:23:06.536]  I think?
[00:23:06.556 --> 00:23:06.716]  I think?
[00:23:31.556 --> 00:23:34.157]  And are the main danger to the planet.
[00:23:35.497 --> 00:23:46.601]  And in that danger because those who are supposed to have to defend the values of the West are co-opted by a vision of the world that is inexorably leads to socialism and thereby poverty.
[00:23:47.581 --> 00:23:49.182]  And he goes on to indict them.
[00:23:50.509 --> 00:23:52.230]  The pro Trump populist leader.
[00:23:52.951 --> 00:23:54.392]  People say, oh, he's one of them, he's there.
[00:23:54.732 --> 00:23:58.776]  He's there laughing at them, laughing at Klaus Schwab when he introduced him.
[00:23:59.376 --> 00:24:07.223]  Klaus Schwab is deathly afraid of all this and is simply trying to co-op everybody into their globalist order that is dead on arrival.
[00:24:07.723 --> 00:24:19.613]  And coming up, Pastor Rodney Howard Brown, one of the greatest pastors out there that 25 years ago envisioned that there would be a great reset and a great awakening and that we would be in this time.
[00:24:20.782 --> 00:24:45.059]  Has traveled over 100 countries and has missions in dozens of countries and he can tell you what's really happening in the world we're going to get his insights coming up and then Jack Pasobek one of the best military political analyst out there this guy is dead on join just in the second hour in the third hour Avi Amini great rebel news reporter on the mountain top with more confrontations come in as we speak

[00:24:56.567 --> 00:25:05.516]  We've got all these leaked documents, other German government and others saying they've been war is imminent absolute total and complete insanity.
[00:25:05.676 --> 00:25:06.016]  All right.
[00:25:07.317 --> 00:25:10.300]  It'll break here in a few minutes and come back with a great Rodney Howard Brown.
[00:25:11.365 --> 00:25:17.571]  And his wonderful river church there in Tampa, Florida, and his international TV and radio programs.

[00:26:09.341 --> 00:26:09.721]  These two...
[00:26:10.561 --> 00:26:10.881]  I think?
[00:26:10.901 --> 00:26:11.061]  I think?
[00:26:11.101 --> 00:26:11.321]  I think?
[00:26:11.341 --> 00:26:11.522]  I think?
[00:26:11.542 --> 00:26:12.102]  I think?
[00:26:38.919 --> 00:26:43.065]  But I have to pay half the bills of free speech system and I don't have the money.
[00:26:43.505 --> 00:26:44.887]  And he's not reverse his ruling.
[00:26:45.328 --> 00:26:46.489]  So that's the chicken armor.
[00:26:46.529 --> 00:26:48.812]  So, get the book The Great Awakening.
[00:26:48.832 --> 00:26:49.774]  I want to thank those of you.
[00:26:51.052 --> 00:26:51.753]  That did get it.
[00:26:52.413 --> 00:26:54.054]  The signed copy is a fundraiser.
[00:26:54.175 --> 00:26:56.176]  It also funds us to get the unsigned copy.
[00:26:56.356 --> 00:26:58.718]  If you're on the fence, please keep us on the air.
[00:26:59.059 --> 00:27:00.680]  There's not any operation with it.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:05.724]  You can find that is more in the face of the globus is having a bigger effect on air and off air.
[00:27:05.984 --> 00:27:11.449]  We've got the ear of Trump, the ear of Joe Rogan, the ear of Elon Musk, the ear of Tucker Carlson.
[00:27:11.829 --> 00:27:13.210]  And quite frankly, I'll speak honestly.
[00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:14.111]  It all goes to God.
[00:27:14.571 --> 00:27:17.754]  I'm as effective behind the scenes as I am on air.
[00:27:17.894 --> 00:27:19.596]  I spend probably an hour a day.
[00:27:20.529 --> 00:27:27.891]  Shending those gentlemen and other people and other prominent folks information documents and reports.
[00:27:28.972 --> 00:27:29.292]  Okay.
[00:27:31.072 --> 00:27:33.613]  And that's what this is all about.
[00:27:33.773 --> 00:27:35.974]  So we're bad at the grassroots.
[00:27:35.994 --> 00:27:38.094]  We're battling at the very heights of the political order.
[00:27:38.494 --> 00:27:42.115]  We have a good chance of really backing down the new era.
[00:27:42.135 --> 00:27:47.177]  I think getting a Nineveh type reprieve like Jonah got for Nineveh for a hundred years.
[00:27:47.517 --> 00:27:48.158]  We're good to go.
[00:27:48.178 --> 00:27:48.318]  I think?

[00:28:52.369 --> 00:28:54.752]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown on the other side.
[00:28:59.761 --> 00:29:03.984]  The second American revolution is happening now right in front of you.
[00:29:04.304 --> 00:29:08.648]  And you're tuned in for wars because you're either looking for the truth or you're already a patriot.

[00:29:40.053 --> 00:29:41.954]  I know there's millions of forms of media out there.
[00:29:41.974 --> 00:29:42.815]  And all this BS.
[00:29:43.055 --> 00:29:44.836]  And the globalists hope you get lost in all of it.
[00:29:45.196 --> 00:29:47.778]  But notice the globalists, the New World Order, are coming after us.
[00:29:48.098 --> 00:29:49.859]  Because they realize we've got their number.
[00:29:50.739 --> 00:29:51.540]  Think about it.
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:52.941]  Infowars is the tip of the spear.
[00:29:53.581 --> 00:29:54.782]  You want to support the tip of the spear?

[00:32:19.256 --> 00:32:20.376]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[00:32:20.816 --> 00:32:26.219]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[00:32:26.759 --> 00:32:32.182]  Most of the other iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[00:32:32.802 --> 00:32:35.544]  But this is pure atomic certified
[00:32:37.469 --> 00:32:38.670]  I don't know.
[00:33:01.917 --> 00:33:05.980]  Leading a front assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:06.521 --> 00:33:07.842]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:22.213 --> 00:33:26.176]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[00:33:26.677 --> 00:33:28.058]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:29.051 --> 00:33:52.600]  Well, he was the first major preacher who's on hundreds of countries around the world as a mega church there in Tampa Florida ministries all over the plant he was the first preacher to get arrested in the Covid lockdowns and he caused a chain reaction of other pastors around the world he's right about the death shot going back way first started pushing it
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.803]  Four years ago, I really want to say he's my pastor.
[00:33:56.304 --> 00:33:59.827]  Rodney Howard Brown at Revival.com.
[00:33:59.948 --> 00:34:02.590]  Revival, just like it sounds, dot com.
[00:34:03.311 --> 00:34:05.313]  And I wanted to get him to pop in today.
[00:34:05.334 --> 00:34:08.897]  I've only got 30 minutes with him, Jack Posobic, coming up after that.
[00:34:09.178 --> 00:34:10.679]  And obviously I wanted to get him on about Trump.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:11.900]  We're good to go.
[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:12.281]  I think?
[00:34:12.301 --> 00:34:12.821]  I think?
[00:34:12.841 --> 00:34:13.001]  I think?
[00:34:13.021 --> 00:34:13.221]  I think?
[00:34:13.241 --> 00:34:13.481]  I think?
[00:34:13.541 --> 00:34:13.861]  I think?
[00:34:13.881 --> 00:34:14.042]  I think?
[00:34:14.082 --> 00:34:14.242]  I think?
[00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:29.771]  I think?
[00:34:29.791 --> 00:34:30.011]  I think?
[00:34:30.031 --> 00:34:30.591]  I think?
[00:34:30.611 --> 00:34:30.772]  I think?
[00:34:49.824 --> 00:34:54.627]  Hey Alex, I love your opening, that's the theme from Airwolf, I believe it is.
[00:34:54.647 --> 00:34:54.887]  Yes.
[00:34:55.087 --> 00:34:58.509]  I always feel like we're coming in on a tech on the globalists right now.
[00:34:58.909 --> 00:35:02.451]  I could just see us flying in and taking out the WEF.
[00:35:02.951 --> 00:35:07.093]  Anyway, good to see you.
[00:35:07.694 --> 00:35:08.314]  Good to see you.
[00:35:08.354 --> 00:35:13.257]  Well, let's plunge into, you were telling me great stuff and the break, I said hold on, repeat that for the audience.
[00:35:13.537 --> 00:35:15.158]  Trump, the moment we're in history right now.
[00:35:16.656 --> 00:35:27.809]  All right, so obviously the landslide that took place up in New Hampshire, Iowa, sorry, the landslide.
[00:35:27.929 --> 00:35:35.418]  And I mean, I see they flipped stuff right at the last minute for Haley, and these were all counties that were for Biden at the last minute.
[00:35:36.036 --> 00:35:59.282]  I was actually watching, and I actually tuned into CNN, just because I wanted to see their reaction, and it was, they were such liars, so you could see they're filming, they were filming a county, which Trump actually won, they were filming one of the caucuses, which Trump lost that one, but the other two balanced out, he won that whole county.
[00:35:59.921 --> 00:36:02.943]  And they were saying, look how honest the election is.
[00:36:03.263 --> 00:36:04.544]  Each ballot is counted.
[00:36:04.804 --> 00:36:06.866]  This is what happened in Philadelphia.
[00:36:06.886 --> 00:36:08.927]  This is what happened in Pennsylvania and Arizona.
[00:36:09.267 --> 00:36:10.909]  And I'm just sitting there shaking my head.
[00:36:11.389 --> 00:36:14.151]  No, this is not what happened there.
[00:36:14.531 --> 00:36:16.032]  But anyway, so here he is.
[00:36:16.112 --> 00:36:17.393]  He wins every county.
[00:36:17.533 --> 00:36:18.774]  I know they flipped the lottery.
[00:36:18.854 --> 00:36:19.875]  I don't count that.
[00:36:19.975 --> 00:36:22.737]  I count what was announced on the night.
[00:36:23.737 --> 00:36:28.040]  I mean, even the fact that CNN called it after 30 minutes, they knew it was going to be a landslide.
[00:36:30.023 --> 00:36:32.365]  So, here he is, he's back.
[00:36:32.485 --> 00:36:33.587]  People are mad.
[00:36:33.647 --> 00:36:39.312]  The Lifters are very upset because they've thrown everything at him, including the kitchen sink.
[00:36:39.893 --> 00:36:41.915]  And he just keeps going up in popularity.
[00:36:42.475 --> 00:36:44.177]  And, uh, I know everybody's watching.
[00:36:44.217 --> 00:36:47.020]  Well, how can you even vote for somebody like that?
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.501]  He's a this, he's a this.
[00:36:48.881 --> 00:36:50.183]  None of that stuff is proven.
[00:36:50.423 --> 00:36:51.524]  All of that stuff's lies.
[00:36:52.084 --> 00:36:54.487]  All of these court cases are just banana.
[00:36:55.211 --> 00:36:56.652]  We're good to go.
[00:37:12.405 --> 00:37:35.789]  First he believes in America as as as a country which we you can see our obviously you know better than most people the open borders of what they're doing right now military age people better flooding our borders and basically trying to dilute America set up new redistricting with a new voting and everybody voting for
[00:37:36.429 --> 00:37:44.836]  The money that's coming, I was talking to a pastor in Germany and she was telling me they have several companies and she said it's very hard to hire people right now.
[00:37:44.896 --> 00:37:48.659]  She said because they just called a doctor saying we don't feel as well.
[00:37:49.259 --> 00:37:52.562]  And so when they do that, the doctor said, well, how many days do you want off?
[00:37:52.582 --> 00:37:54.663]  They said, well, we think we'll take 10 days off.
[00:37:55.284 --> 00:38:00.668]  And so they take 10 days off and she said it's hard to find anybody doing any work.
[00:38:01.372 --> 00:38:10.896]  And, um, she said they also did a census now on the houses to see how many people are living in your house so they can make you take in, um, illegals.
[00:38:11.316 --> 00:38:13.777]  So, obviously, you see they're happening up in Massachusetts.
[00:38:13.817 --> 00:38:15.278]  They're doing the exact same thing there.
[00:38:16.098 --> 00:38:18.879]  And, um, this ridiculous stuff that's going on.
[00:38:18.939 --> 00:38:23.661]  So Trump is the only one out of everybody that can actually bring a stop to this.
[00:38:23.741 --> 00:38:27.163]  And now I'm just concerned about something that, um,
[00:38:27.919 --> 00:38:33.461]  Maybe he hasn't learned his lesson because he was surrounded by Deep State.
[00:38:34.161 --> 00:38:40.563]  We found out now that Mike Pence was the leaker to the press of everything happening inside the Oval Office.
[00:38:40.923 --> 00:38:45.444]  So when everybody said Trump's doing this, Trump's mad about this, it was Mike Pence that was spilling the beans.
[00:38:45.964 --> 00:38:52.166]  So I see the same kind of people surrounding him right now, which I'm very concerned about, very concerned about.
[00:38:53.889 --> 00:38:54.570]  I think?
[00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:55.170]  I think?
[00:39:17.342 --> 00:39:45.588]  You know with the the X virus now the new X virus try to get everything back to man in balance but still then I can't see them carrying this next election I don't care what they do I think even even some of the most liberal people have done now that done with Biden they done with all the nonsense and the lies and the gas lighting basically all everything is great the economy is great whatever and people say no it's not
[00:39:46.221 --> 00:39:49.044]  So they're not buying the Emperor's new clothes.
[00:39:49.224 --> 00:39:50.645]  They've seen through all of this stuff.
[00:39:50.665 --> 00:39:52.347]  So, I think Trump's gonna win.
[00:39:52.787 --> 00:39:54.348]  That's the way I'm looking at it right now.
[00:39:54.749 --> 00:40:00.174]  I'm concerned that even if he does win, that once again he's surrounded by a bunch of clowns.
[00:40:00.754 --> 00:40:02.296]  I'm very concerned about that.
[00:40:02.396 --> 00:40:03.977]  That's like a thing that irritates me.
[00:40:04.458 --> 00:40:09.262]  If I was him, I would pick Dr. Ben Carson to be
[00:40:09.775 --> 00:40:12.819]  The vice president, the reason I would, he's a medical doctor number one.
[00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:17.285]  He's been loyal to Trump from right throughout his tenure.
[00:40:17.846 --> 00:40:22.593]  And then also the fact that if Trump wins, they're going to go to race rides.
[00:40:22.913 --> 00:40:24.155]  So we need someone.
[00:40:24.622 --> 00:40:27.103]  Like Dr. Carson, who can stand in the gap.
[00:40:27.123 --> 00:40:28.463]  So this is my take on it.
[00:40:28.883 --> 00:40:33.584]  I'm not saying it's 100%, but I just feel I'm concerned about it.
[00:40:33.624 --> 00:40:40.526]  I think we need to pray the whole of America is dependent upon really what takes place now in November.
[00:40:41.967 --> 00:40:45.828]  Not that we can turn everything around, but it'll be a stay of execution.
[00:40:46.288 --> 00:40:50.429]  Ultimately, we have to see the stuff that's coming out of Davos this week.
[00:40:51.198 --> 00:41:15.117]  Put to, uh, put to an end as far as all of their plans for population reduction, uh, eugenics, uh, and just everything, the wars, they want this war so bad with Iran because it'll keep Netanyahu in power, it'll keep the Mullahs in power, it'll keep all, all the criminals will stay in power based on this war, so Trump's the only one that will be able to say no, we're not doing it.
[00:41:16.496 --> 00:41:17.617]  They don't like his rhetoric.
[00:41:17.697 --> 00:41:19.218]  They don't like the way that he talks.
[00:41:19.559 --> 00:41:23.422]  I love the way he talks, because somebody needs to say, I was laughing.
[00:41:23.882 --> 00:41:25.744]  I was laughing at the Iowa election.
[00:41:26.124 --> 00:41:31.569]  So he tells everybody, everybody needs to vote, even if you're sick, to say, honey, we gotta go.
[00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:37.894]  Even if I die, me going out right now, at least I'm dying for the cause of America.
[00:41:38.334 --> 00:41:39.175]  And that's just Trump.
[00:41:39.435 --> 00:41:40.576]  You know, he says it like it is.
[00:41:41.097 --> 00:41:41.977]  People didn't like it.
[00:41:42.658 --> 00:41:43.639]  Obviously, he and I,
[00:41:44.566 --> 00:41:51.210]  We're not in agreement with what happened with COVID and Dr. Fauci and Berks and all that kind of stuff.
[00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:54.872]  But look, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt on all of that stuff.
[00:41:55.272 --> 00:41:59.434]  The bottom line is in the lineup of everybody running.
[00:41:59.554 --> 00:42:01.255]  I mean, I could tell you about Vivek.
[00:42:01.795 --> 00:42:02.376]  He's a star.
[00:42:03.271 --> 00:42:04.232]  We're good to go.
[00:42:04.252 --> 00:42:04.392]  I think?
[00:42:04.412 --> 00:42:05.232]  We're good to go.
[00:42:34.553 --> 00:42:36.914]  It's like Hillary and Biden using the exact same speech.
[00:42:36.954 --> 00:42:37.455]  Absolutely.
[00:42:37.475 --> 00:42:39.075]  He's definitely got his homework, all those things.
[00:42:39.255 --> 00:42:41.796]  So, but shifting out of that, you mentioned race riots.
[00:42:42.637 --> 00:42:47.398]  The Democrat Party, the CIA, the former defense heads have all said Trump is going to be a dictator.
[00:42:47.418 --> 00:42:52.880]  We've got to have Congress strip the power of the military preemptively away from Trump if he wins.
[00:42:53.361 --> 00:42:54.981]  And Senator Blumenthal is introducing a bill.
[00:42:55.221 --> 00:42:58.983]  They say if black lives matters protesting, he's not allowed to stop it.
[00:42:59.243 --> 00:43:01.824]  So they're trying to legalize a communist revolution.
[00:43:02.464 --> 00:43:02.724]  I think?
[00:43:02.824 --> 00:43:03.144]  I think?
[00:43:26.204 --> 00:43:37.843]  Well, first of all, he must stop talking, because I think the two people that are pushing him, and I know you're friends with him, I think Roger Stone and, um, um, uh, the, who's the, who's the general?
[00:43:39.125 --> 00:43:39.666]  Um... Flynn!
[00:43:41.016 --> 00:43:44.498]  Yeah, they're both, you know, pushing nationalism.
[00:43:44.999 --> 00:43:53.104]  He, he, they're both of them are pushing nationalism, which we have to be very careful about because Trump is saying I'll be a dictator for a day.
[00:43:53.304 --> 00:43:55.005]  You cannot talk that rhetoric.
[00:43:55.145 --> 00:43:57.006]  You can't be, you can't be a dictator.
[00:43:57.026 --> 00:43:57.967]  He has to be president.
[00:43:58.427 --> 00:44:02.650]  So if we got to stop him from speaking that rhetoric, even though it's a joke,
[00:44:03.684 --> 00:44:05.886]  He cannot be saying, I'll be a dictator for a day.
[00:44:05.966 --> 00:44:11.630]  We, because then people say, if you're going to be a dictator for a day, you might be for a month or, or, or a year.
[00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:13.651]  And then that'll push them guys to strip.
[00:44:14.011 --> 00:44:16.233]  They'll try to strip the power away from the president.
[00:44:16.593 --> 00:44:19.015]  And the fact is that the president is command and chief.
[00:44:21.036 --> 00:44:26.338]  And they want to try to remove that ability from the President to have power over the military.
[00:44:26.358 --> 00:44:37.001]  That's right, they're trying to define his normal duties and his office and his responsibility as martial law, as a dictator, while they themselves are establishing a totalitarian system.
[00:44:38.703 --> 00:44:40.103]  Yeah, but he shouldn't have joked about it.
[00:44:40.123 --> 00:44:42.024]  He shouldn't even just say I'll be a dictator for a day.
[00:44:42.044 --> 00:44:42.184]  I agree.
[00:44:42.524 --> 00:44:47.066]  Because that falls into the whole rhetoric of what they want to do so they can remove his power.
[00:44:47.426 --> 00:44:49.146]  I mean, that's what a commander chief is.
[00:44:49.226 --> 00:44:51.187]  He's the guy in charge of the military.
[00:44:51.627 --> 00:44:58.049]  So I think, obviously, we have to pray, number one, that the clowns don't get around him and take him in the wrong direction.
[00:44:58.649 --> 00:45:05.872]  And a lot of the people that are funded, there's even people funded by China, which I don't want to go public right now on this stuff.
[00:45:05.892 --> 00:45:07.032]  I'll talk to you privately about it.
[00:45:07.492 --> 00:45:13.580]  That I actually come around him that have billions and billions of dollars right now because they saw what just took place in Iowa.
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:16.423]  I think New Hampshire is going to be a whitewash again.
[00:45:16.924 --> 00:45:26.176]  So I think they realize is going to get in and there's nothing they can do to stop it so they want to come in control the whole thing and you know he had.
[00:45:26.656 --> 00:45:31.661]  According to what I'd heard from the inside that he'd had 27 attempts on his life.
[00:45:31.701 --> 00:45:36.446]  I mean, that's how much they can't stand the guy because they know that he was putting a stop.
[00:45:36.507 --> 00:45:37.448]  We had no wars.
[00:45:38.088 --> 00:45:39.870]  Everything was turning around in America.
[00:45:40.391 --> 00:45:41.412]  Everything was coming.
[00:45:41.872 --> 00:45:42.833]  We're good to go.
[00:45:42.853 --> 00:45:43.113]  I think?
[00:45:43.133 --> 00:45:43.834]  I think?
[00:45:43.854 --> 00:45:44.134]  I think?
[00:45:44.154 --> 00:45:44.855]  I think?
[00:46:00.109 --> 00:46:01.650]  You said doner estimating on.
[00:46:02.131 --> 00:46:04.493]  He's a South African you know he's got stuff of a sleep.
[00:46:04.533 --> 00:46:05.994]  I think he's probably good.
[00:46:06.314 --> 00:46:08.056]  Well I see him coming way over to us.
[00:46:08.476 --> 00:46:11.518]  The globers are coming after him with criminal investigations the EU.
[00:46:11.538 --> 00:46:14.821]  I mean he definitely is definitely going after.
[00:46:14.841 --> 00:46:16.582]  I don't know him well here in Austin.
[00:46:16.983 --> 00:46:18.884]  They say behind the scenes he sounds just like us.
[00:46:18.944 --> 00:46:19.845]  He's really pissed off.
[00:46:21.366 --> 00:46:23.348]  He because he can's taking place.
[00:46:23.408 --> 00:46:24.489]  I mean he's got everything.
[00:46:24.649 --> 00:46:25.730]  He doesn't need anything.
[00:46:26.354 --> 00:46:31.516]  But obviously, as a concern, like we do, he sees things maybe from a different perspective.
[00:46:31.556 --> 00:46:33.496]  So I think he's a wrecking ball.
[00:46:33.837 --> 00:46:37.998]  And I just wish Trump would come back on X and be mouthing off.
[00:46:38.598 --> 00:46:40.399]  Yeah, that's really foolish that Trump won't.
[00:46:40.459 --> 00:46:43.580]  He could use X to promote truth social and make him bigger.
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:44.120]  It's dumb.
[00:46:45.307 --> 00:47:13.045]  You know but true social is going no way there's no I mean I get no I agree but his argument is he's true social yeah use your you know 80 whatever man follows and then push that it's so exactly it's having your right hand time on your back that is Trump is doing expost every day they have a hundred damn views effect effect I agree I know Roger talk to every day everybody to call Trump and tell him stop it because that is a blunder
[00:47:16.572 --> 00:47:17.314]  It needs to go on.
[00:47:17.917 --> 00:47:18.298]  Every day.
[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:22.854]  You'll be dropping truth bombs on a daily basis and still have truth on the side.
[00:47:23.504 --> 00:47:26.265]  But just dropping so anyway, I'm just praying.
[00:47:26.766 --> 00:47:38.831]  I think I'm concerned about the wrong people in his ear, you know, and I've been invited tomorrow on many times, but I'm so busy focused on ministry Alex and nations and the things that we're doing.
[00:47:39.251 --> 00:47:40.392]  So I don't want to get sidetracked.
[00:47:40.452 --> 00:47:52.357]  I love coming on your show and then I do a weekly news program and then I got panned on YouTube a week a week ago for seven days because I've made an announcement on Christmas Eve about vaccines, you know,
[00:47:53.283 --> 00:47:56.525]  Um, anyway, let's talk quickly about this, uh, chemtrail thing.
[00:47:56.565 --> 00:48:08.651]  So, um, I was talking to this doctor, and, uh, they were doing tests on people, and, um, they said, uh, they kept finding people with, uh, deuterium, deuterium in it, in their blood.
[00:48:09.371 --> 00:48:12.433]  And they said this, this will drop the population by 25%.
[00:48:13.793 --> 00:48:34.064]  Of course, as you know, all the spike protein, there was another doctor that I posted on my news program, that this 28-year-old German kid died, and they did, they bisected his testicles, his testes, and they found every, every sperm was replaced with a, with
[00:48:36.348 --> 00:48:37.050]  Uh, the metal.
[00:48:37.511 --> 00:48:38.153]  Um, please.
[00:48:38.614 --> 00:48:40.018]  Sorry, I forgot it now.
[00:48:40.038 --> 00:48:41.241]  We're putting it on screen right now.
[00:48:41.281 --> 00:48:41.642]  Keep going.
[00:48:43.576 --> 00:48:44.716]  No, no, it was area.
[00:48:44.736 --> 00:48:45.717]  Yeah, it was area.
[00:48:46.237 --> 00:48:48.217]  No, it was replaced with the spike protein.
[00:48:48.297 --> 00:48:48.998]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:48:49.338 --> 00:48:54.999]  So every, every, every sperm was converted with the spike protein.
[00:48:55.039 --> 00:48:56.900]  So they've got it on screen theorem.
[00:48:57.300 --> 00:49:05.422]  This thing is going to drop population by 25%, which as you know, is the end go in human depopulation of the planet.
[00:49:05.823 --> 00:49:06.963]  So they'll do it by war.
[00:49:07.543 --> 00:49:08.624]  They'll do it by the chemtrails.
[00:49:08.904 --> 00:49:10.185]  Oh, yes, something else, Alex.
[00:49:10.405 --> 00:49:11.146]  Are you ready for this?
[00:49:11.546 --> 00:49:15.589]  Now, I don't have the source on this, but somebody, I'm gonna get, I'm gonna get it and get it to you.
[00:49:16.149 --> 00:49:34.421]  But, um, I was told that Disney, Disney Company paid somebody to go into every Disney movie and to put chemtrails in every scene so that everybody can just think chemtrails have been around for 50 years.
[00:49:34.441 --> 00:49:34.861]  $60 million.
[00:49:38.413 --> 00:49:39.315]  Alex, can you imagine that?
[00:49:40.097 --> 00:49:40.638]  Absolutely.
[00:49:40.679 --> 00:49:42.623]  Look, I want to explain something.
[00:49:44.329 --> 00:49:45.250]  We're good to go.
[00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:45.510]  I think?
[00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:45.830]  I think?
[00:50:09.693 --> 00:50:09.933]  I think?
[00:50:09.953 --> 00:50:10.214]  I think?
[00:50:10.314 --> 00:50:10.574]  I think?
[00:50:10.594 --> 00:50:10.814]  I think?
[00:50:10.834 --> 00:50:11.094]  I think?
[00:50:11.114 --> 00:50:11.275]  I think?
[00:50:11.295 --> 00:50:11.855]  I think?
[00:50:30.974 --> 00:50:31.995]  And, uh, you bury him.
[00:50:32.355 --> 00:50:38.439]  And again, usually when we talk about geoengineering, we'll show smaller companies that do it just to make it rain for a ski resort.
[00:50:38.819 --> 00:50:41.641]  Everybody diverts off onto that, and that's what we always show as a religion.
[00:50:42.262 --> 00:50:44.783]  But, the, the, the, the issue is this is not.
[00:50:44.823 --> 00:50:46.905]  This is, this is low level geoengineering.
[00:50:47.285 --> 00:50:52.769]  The real geoengineering goes on not from small drones, not from small aircraft.
[00:50:53.369 --> 00:50:57.552]  It goes on with electromagnetic towers on the ground.
[00:50:57.592 --> 00:51:00.354]  I'm gonna do a definitive report on this soon, okay?
[00:51:01.214 --> 00:51:20.266]  Towerss on Zoldi classified towers on ground eyes the atmosphere then jets don't even know they're doing the companies don't even know it's all the big major kerosin makers that's jet fuel then it blows all this nuclei out the cover stories for geo engineering but really it goes into the soil and that's what you were talking about the deterium
[00:51:22.423 --> 00:51:35.938]  Yep, so I mean, so what I found was quite amusing was that the Disney company paid a guy $60 million to go into every Disney movie and whatever scene that they saw of a blue skull was to put Kemp Trails in there.
[00:51:35.958 --> 00:51:40.223]  So obviously I don't have verification on there, but that's what I heard yesterday.
[00:51:40.803 --> 00:51:44.084]  So, um, I mean, they're hell-bent on destroying people.
[00:51:44.324 --> 00:51:45.044]  They hate people.
[00:51:45.204 --> 00:51:46.145]  These people are scum.
[00:51:46.565 --> 00:51:53.427]  They want us to eat bugs, crickets, and every kind of insect while they're feasting on the finest of food.
[00:51:53.887 --> 00:51:58.228]  And I don't know about you, Alex, I'm not swapping a steak for crickets.
[00:51:58.928 --> 00:51:59.428]  I'm not doing it.
[00:51:59.468 --> 00:52:00.629]  It's not gonna happen.
[00:52:01.289 --> 00:52:01.749]  So, um,
[00:52:02.771 --> 00:52:04.392]  Anyway, everybody's going to stand up.
[00:52:04.432 --> 00:52:07.313]  We're going to pray and believe God that God will intervene.
[00:52:07.453 --> 00:52:14.577]  And of course, obviously, we're preaching gospel, getting people safe, telling Jesus is coming very soon and they need to surrender their life.
[00:52:15.057 --> 00:52:16.798]  I mean, we are living in the final hour.
[00:52:16.838 --> 00:52:17.938]  There's no question about it.
[00:52:18.819 --> 00:52:19.779]  But we're not done yet.
[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:24.722]  And Jesus even said, when I come back, will I find faith on the earth and
[00:52:26.124 --> 00:52:27.124]  I know you've been through it.
[00:52:28.625 --> 00:52:45.692]  Even when you came and you were here with me for the weekend, I just realized, I mean, the burden that you've carried and everything that you've spoken out in truth, basically from facts that you've had over the years, how people have taken and twisted and lied about you.
[00:52:47.173 --> 00:52:50.454]  As before I came on the air, you talk about Trump, they talk about
[00:52:50.934 --> 00:53:17.814]  stuff on his hands trying to signify that this is that whatever the stuff people make up today believe it is the truth is horrendous and so you have to ignore all of that and just keep moving on I've been line about on every front head books written about me I'm according to the critics I'm some hypnotist trained by some India in India and Swami and this the stuff is so ludicous that
[00:53:19.066 --> 00:53:28.934]  I can still remember when I got back in the 90s, somebody had written a book, a whole book about me, and I said to my wife, I was reading the book, I said, I can't believe I've done all these things.
[00:53:29.374 --> 00:53:31.216]  This is unbelievable, honey, listen to this.
[00:53:31.696 --> 00:53:33.077]  Apparently, we're supposed to have done this.
[00:53:33.458 --> 00:53:44.106]  So, in the end, you just have to totally ignore and not pay any attention to the rubbish and stay focused on what God's telling you to do, which I think
[00:53:44.739 --> 00:53:51.484]  I mean, I'm so happy when Elon put you back, I was so, yes, I said, that's it.
[00:53:52.044 --> 00:53:52.485]  There it is.
[00:53:52.785 --> 00:53:54.386]  And I saw everything explode for you.
[00:53:54.646 --> 00:53:56.107]  Millions and millions of views and everything.
[00:53:56.547 --> 00:53:59.589]  I'm so happy, as I told you in September, don't give up.
[00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:04.233]  Not that you were, but you're about to have a breakthrough and you did actually have a breakthrough.
[00:54:05.453 --> 00:54:34.709]  Anyway, we just explain that since you literally because I've known you for years but you had me out to your church and you had me for dinner and hung out your family and the great crew and all the ministries coming through and how busy were I'd be going like 9 o'clock at night you were still meet with pastors from all the world and you said listen God told me about to have a break through and God told me he on must is going to put you back on X do you remember saying that I was going I don't think so pastor I maybe maybe I don't remember
[00:54:35.629 --> 00:54:35.869]  I think?
[00:55:05.953 --> 00:55:23.946]  Sorry, I know, I know, I know that the Lord rubs dung on the faces of our enemies, you know, when we serve him, when our hearts are pure, and I mean, Alex, I've known you, I've been listening to you for a long time, so, I know that your total motive has got nothing to do with it, and nobody chooses to do what you do with another motive.
[00:55:24.526 --> 00:55:31.251]  Because, I mean, all you did was paint a target on yourself, where people came after you, came after your family, came after your children, came after everything.
[00:55:31.778 --> 00:55:33.439]  So it's the same as Trump.
[00:55:33.819 --> 00:55:41.404]  When you're worth billions, why would you put yourself at risk trying to save America and turn things around, you know?
[00:55:41.884 --> 00:55:43.966]  So, but I'm sorry, I'm so excited.
[00:55:44.006 --> 00:55:48.589]  I was so happy when I saw you come on live and I watched all the, um, everything explode for you.
[00:55:48.649 --> 00:55:50.190]  And I think it's going to get big and bigger.
[00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:52.531]  Well, I know I can feel a whole spirit really stronger.
[00:55:52.551 --> 00:55:52.731]  I felt
[00:56:21.852 --> 00:56:36.261]  I felt, I was like really upset how the lies can keep coming against somebody, pounding, pounding, and everybody just, because you had been totally deplatformed on every side, and I kept saying, surely there has to be a breakthrough.
[00:56:36.301 --> 00:56:42.385]  You cannot, the wicked cannot prevail over the righteous like what it's doing right now.
[00:56:43.169 --> 00:56:48.411]  And so, and I understand you, you're up around the hedges for some people in the religious world.
[00:56:48.811 --> 00:56:51.812]  I am as well because I say things just like they are.
[00:56:51.973 --> 00:56:53.113]  I don't hold anything back.
[00:56:53.893 --> 00:56:59.996]  So, but the bottom line is I felt in my spirit that there was going to be a total breakthrough for you.
[00:57:00.576 --> 00:57:03.537]  And I felt that it's come and I don't feel it's going to stop.
[00:57:03.637 --> 00:57:08.099]  I think it's going to be breakthrough upon breakthrough because everything they do from now on out.
[00:57:08.812 --> 00:57:09.352]  We're good to go.
[00:57:09.372 --> 00:57:09.753]  I think?
[00:57:30.006 --> 00:57:31.228]  Or in a little side room by it.
[00:57:31.449 --> 00:57:34.634]  And he was just like, bam, it's going to be broken.
[00:57:34.694 --> 00:57:35.355]  It's going to happen.
[00:57:35.615 --> 00:57:38.380]  It was just like, and it wasn't that I believed it.
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:39.862]  I knew it was true.
[00:57:39.882 --> 00:57:41.966]  And it's happening, folks.
[00:57:42.266 --> 00:57:43.388]  We'll be right back in two minutes.
[00:57:43.708 --> 00:57:44.089]  Stay with us.
[00:57:49.731 --> 00:57:51.874]  Let me start by saying you do a great show.
[00:57:52.034 --> 00:57:52.374]  Thank you.
[00:57:52.594 --> 00:57:55.137]  And let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[00:57:55.197 --> 00:57:56.459]  I started taking that stuff.
[00:57:56.499 --> 00:57:59.562]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[00:57:59.582 --> 00:58:00.724]  When did you start taking it?
[00:58:00.984 --> 00:58:04.948]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[00:58:05.589 --> 00:58:08.311]  And I started eating a little better, but my blood pressure stayed high.
[00:58:08.331 --> 00:58:15.836]  And when I took X2 iodine, after about two or four weeks, I think my body was detoxified of a bunch of metals and stuff that my body was storing.
[00:58:15.956 --> 00:58:18.158]  And my blood pressure came down to perfect level.
[00:58:18.538 --> 00:58:21.480]  And I tell people the only thing I did was X2 iodine.
[00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:35.809]  And even though I do think all your other products are good, I recommend to anybody that they start with X2 iodine because it detoxifies your body and kind of kicks your natural DNA into full force.
[00:58:35.889 --> 00:58:39.391]  So, in my life, I found X2 iodine the best.
[00:58:39.832 --> 00:58:43.294]  I tried other iodines and they didn't have the same effect.
[00:58:43.574 --> 00:58:45.876]  So, X2 iodine, I really wanted to point that out.
[00:58:51.738 --> 00:58:53.139]  Last year we put this book out.
[00:58:53.979 --> 00:58:55.380]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:57.180]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:59.181]  Now we've put part two out.
[00:58:59.241 --> 00:59:00.982]  It's even thicker and more powerful.
[00:59:01.542 --> 00:59:02.442]  The Great Awakening.
[00:59:02.522 --> 00:59:06.384]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[00:59:06.784 --> 00:59:08.445]  This is such a powerful book.
[00:59:08.845 --> 00:59:10.526]  It covers all the globalist plans.
[00:59:11.186 --> 00:59:11.626]  We're good to go.
[00:59:30.345 --> 00:59:37.788]  This is next level information and it's a great way to not just support the broadcast but inform yourself the next level and share the book with friends and family.
[00:59:37.808 --> 00:59:44.471]  So whether you want one copy or multiple copies, go now to info or store.com and get the great awakening.
[00:59:44.671 --> 00:59:45.871]  This is going to go to number one.
[00:59:45.891 --> 00:59:47.212]  I want to thank you for support.
[00:59:47.392 --> 00:59:48.192]  It's a powerful book.
[00:59:48.432 --> 00:59:49.013]  Get yours now.
[00:59:51.493 --> 00:59:55.575]  Leading up front assault on the lies of the new world order.
[00:59:56.095 --> 00:59:57.396]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:07.145 --> 01:00:07.768]  We're good to go.
[01:00:14.076 --> 01:00:14.356]  I think?
[01:00:14.396 --> 01:00:14.656]  I think?
[01:00:14.716 --> 01:00:14.956]  I think?
[01:00:14.976 --> 01:00:15.156]  I think?
[01:00:38.143 --> 01:00:44.946]  Finish up with what God was telling and then larger picture for everybody here because evil just doesn't always win.
[01:00:45.286 --> 01:00:46.607]  God in the interns around.
[01:00:47.968 --> 01:00:49.488]  Yeah, and that was a thing for me.
[01:00:49.809 --> 01:00:53.130]  I was watching everything was trying to just said my wife.
[01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:56.332]  I said, how can one person take all of this?
[01:00:56.772 --> 01:00:57.752]  I mean, it's impossible.
[01:00:57.812 --> 01:00:59.573]  I mean, these people are liars.
[01:00:59.933 --> 01:01:00.654]  They are liars.
[01:01:01.334 --> 01:01:02.575]  What do you say is the truth?
[01:01:03.075 --> 01:01:05.396]  So because he is exposing everything.
[01:01:05.416 --> 01:01:06.296]  They're coming often.
[01:01:06.316 --> 01:01:07.377]  They're trying to take him out.
[01:01:08.044 --> 01:01:15.390]  So I mean, I just prayed, I said, Lord, we have to have a victory, and that's when I felt, if you could just come here for a week, and as a matter of fact, you need to come back.
[01:01:15.671 --> 01:01:19.074]  I've got a lot of stuff happening, and you'll enjoy doing what we're doing here.
[01:01:19.094 --> 01:01:24.038]  But anyway, bottom line is, no, and of course, the breakthrough has come.
[01:01:24.959 --> 01:01:29.823]  Nobody was happier when I saw you go live on X, and I don't believe this is
[01:01:30.463 --> 01:01:34.207]  This is only the beginning, Alex, and you're going to see a pick-up the next couple of months.
[01:01:34.487 --> 01:01:55.186]  This year is going to be a very strong year for him for wars and for everybody and my encouragement to everybody here watching today don't give up keep speaking the truth keep talking exactly God puts on your heart and obviously for the Christians we got a priest in hospital get people safe tell him that there's a heaven again and a health is shown and
[01:01:55.786 --> 01:02:01.047]  All they have to do is invite Jesus to come into their heart, repent of their sin, and say, Lord, come into my heart.
[01:02:01.167 --> 01:02:03.168]  You know, maybe you're watching right now.
[01:02:03.208 --> 01:02:04.368]  You're Catholic or whatever.
[01:02:04.388 --> 01:02:05.028]  It doesn't matter.
[01:02:05.308 --> 01:02:08.629]  You need Jesus to come into your heart and just surrender your life.
[01:02:08.669 --> 01:02:09.809]  Just pray this loud.
[01:02:10.129 --> 01:02:12.590]  Say, Dear Lord Jesus, come into my heart.
[01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:15.630]  Forgive me of my sin and I'll serve you.
[01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:16.110]  That's it.
[01:02:16.431 --> 01:02:17.531]  It's very simple.
[01:02:17.591 --> 01:02:19.271]  It's not a long drawn out thing.
[01:02:19.551 --> 01:02:22.892]  You don't have to go through seven circumcisions and a bunch of
[01:02:23.232 --> 01:02:27.314]  Rigmarole, if you genuinely mean business with God, God means business with you.
[01:02:27.394 --> 01:02:32.696]  So, Alex, from now on, I see that this is going to be a year for the Church of Victory.
[01:02:32.796 --> 01:02:34.117]  I think they want nuclear war.
[01:02:34.137 --> 01:02:37.258]  I think they want a lot of disaster stuff to take place.
[01:02:37.698 --> 01:02:39.279]  I don't see them getting away.
[01:02:39.599 --> 01:02:42.501]  In my spirit, I don't see them getting away with what they want to do.
[01:02:42.961 --> 01:02:43.241]  I think
[01:02:43.881 --> 01:02:46.903]  They realize it's too far gone right now.
[01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:54.347]  I think they're going to have to wait maybe another 15, 20 years for this thing to cycle and for it to come around again.
[01:02:54.407 --> 01:03:06.973]  I think they played the best shots they had mainly because a lot of the guys saw us and all these guys are like nearly 100 years old and the Rothschild I know you know whatever and they just want to see it all happen before they die.
[01:03:07.253 --> 01:03:10.655]  Well many of them are dropping dead like flies and they're not going to see it there.
[01:03:12.359 --> 01:03:14.302]  Kissinger and Charlie Munger died the same week.
[01:03:15.649 --> 01:03:15.989]  Correct.
[01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.609]  Correct.
[01:03:16.649 --> 01:03:19.030]  So, basically, they're not going to get to see.
[01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:23.731]  And now they begin to realize, in a lost eternity, how wrong they were.
[01:03:24.251 --> 01:03:25.651]  Because they're not in purgatory.
[01:03:25.711 --> 01:03:27.952]  They actually, you know, went to hell.
[01:03:28.312 --> 01:03:30.312]  I mean, there's no... Can God save them?
[01:03:30.352 --> 01:03:31.432]  I'm not saying He can't.
[01:03:31.792 --> 01:03:34.453]  But the likelihood of them being saved very remote.
[01:03:34.773 --> 01:03:37.134]  Because for most of their life, they denied God.
[01:03:37.534 --> 01:03:39.114]  And didn't even allow Him in their life.
[01:03:39.174 --> 01:03:42.675]  And so, the Bible says a point a man wants to die off to get the judgment.
[01:03:42.915 --> 01:03:44.035]  The fact of the matter is this.
[01:03:44.476 --> 01:03:46.044]  That righteousness will prevail.
[01:03:46.781 --> 01:03:47.522]  We're good to go.
[01:03:47.542 --> 01:03:47.802]  I think?
[01:04:15.005 --> 01:04:19.026]  Uh, lady from North Dakota or South Dakota.
[01:04:19.527 --> 01:04:22.828]  Uh, he just needs to pick somebody who's straight down the line.
[01:04:23.568 --> 01:04:24.988]  My pick would be Ben Carson.
[01:04:25.008 --> 01:04:27.989]  Maybe people would disagree with me on it, but that's what, that's my pick.
[01:04:28.009 --> 01:04:28.750]  Well, I love Ben.
[01:04:28.770 --> 01:04:30.710]  Well, Pastor, I will come see you soon.
[01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:32.851]  And I love you and your great congregation.
[01:04:32.991 --> 01:04:35.132]  The Spirit of the Lord is so strong in your church.
[01:04:35.172 --> 01:04:37.672]  Everybody can get to that area in Florida.
[01:04:37.712 --> 01:04:40.693]  Should be going to your amazing river church.
[01:04:41.033 --> 01:04:41.814]  Revival.com.
[01:04:41.854 --> 01:04:42.434]  Thank you, Pastor.
[01:04:43.806 --> 01:04:44.506]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:04:44.566 --> 01:04:48.728]  Our conference starts this Sunday and runs for eight days, so it's a very big conference.
[01:04:48.748 --> 01:04:50.869]  It's called the Winter Camp Meeting, so people come.
[01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:52.450]  God bless you, sir.
[01:04:53.711 --> 01:04:54.151]  Bless you, too.
[01:04:54.371 --> 01:04:55.191]  Thank you so much.
[01:04:55.211 --> 01:04:56.432]  We'll be right back with Jack Massato.
[01:04:59.818 --> 01:05:04.040]  The Second American Revolution is happening now right in front of you.
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:08.702]  And you're tuned in for wars because you're either looking for the truth or you're already a patriot.
[01:05:09.182 --> 01:05:17.025]  I'm asking you now to realize we are at the fulcrum, the crossroads in the fight for human destiny and human future.
[01:05:17.685 --> 01:05:19.426]  Please spread the word about the broadcast.
[01:05:19.867 --> 01:05:21.888]  Please buy great products at ForWardStore.com.
[01:05:22.189 --> 01:05:25.131]  And please pray for the transmission.
[01:05:25.411 --> 01:05:26.592]  Without you, we're going to fail.
[01:05:27.033 --> 01:05:36.100]  But if you simply take action and spread the word and pray for the broadcast and buy the products, you will continue to aid us together.
[01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:37.701]  In our victory against these tyrants.
[01:05:37.982 --> 01:05:39.563]  But now is the time to make the decision.
[01:05:40.124 --> 01:05:42.005]  I know there's millions of forms of media out there.
[01:05:42.025 --> 01:05:42.906]  And all this BS.
[01:05:43.126 --> 01:05:44.888]  And the globalists hope you get lost in all of it.
[01:05:45.268 --> 01:05:47.851]  But notice the globalists, the New World Order, are coming after us.
[01:05:48.171 --> 01:05:49.953]  Because they realize we've got their number.
[01:05:50.814 --> 01:05:51.594]  Think about it.
[01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:52.916]  Infowars is the tip of the spear.
[01:05:52.936 --> 01:05:56.399]  If you want to support the tip of the spear, that decision is up to you.
[01:05:56.699 --> 01:05:58.321]  Please support us now in a full story.
[01:06:09.916 --> 01:06:12.885]  Crash through the lies and disinformation.
[01:06:13.507 --> 01:06:14.852]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:35.185 --> 01:06:39.207]  Alright, folks, we've just got him for about 20 minutes.
[01:06:39.927 --> 01:06:52.252]  Jack Masobyk is one of the best analysts out there, great patriot, reporter, journalist, and, of course, former Naval Intelligence, big part of the last two, and now the third Trump campaign to restore our republic.
[01:06:53.112 --> 01:06:53.372]  I think?
[01:06:53.392 --> 01:06:54.113]  I think?
[01:06:54.133 --> 01:06:54.313]  I think?
[01:06:54.333 --> 01:06:54.593]  I think?
[01:07:22.054 --> 01:07:23.195]  I'm a new puppet.
[01:07:23.775 --> 01:07:26.016]  There's the Prime Minister in Poland.
[01:07:26.676 --> 01:07:32.439]  Meanwhile, Jack has said watch for Pakistan, India and Iran to be a potential fair point.
[01:07:32.479 --> 01:07:34.660]  Now they're firing missiles at each other.
[01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:42.244]  We also have some big pipe bomb news that's come out revealed a plain close police officer discovered the DNC pipe bomb.
[01:07:42.664 --> 01:07:44.725]  And now Jack is of course posted on X.
[01:07:45.225 --> 01:07:49.735]  That it's basically identical to the FBI training pipe bombs they use.
[01:07:50.096 --> 01:07:51.599]  So I'm going to try to give Jack the floor.
[01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:55.869]  We've got 22 minutes of airtime with Jack Posobiec.
[01:07:57.566 --> 01:08:19.590]  Alex, thanks again so much for having me on and of course were still the prep work for human and stay it would come up later but I really wanted to get on with you because when I saw this NATO news drop and the 90 thousand troops this massive largest exercise since the cold war where they will be deploying 90,000 troops including what we're told this is out a stars and stripes
[01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:20.070]  I think?
[01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:20.291]  I think?
[01:08:20.311 --> 01:08:20.731]  I think?
[01:08:20.831 --> 01:08:21.012]  I think?
[01:08:39.955 --> 01:09:09.092]  Of course because it's proximity to Ukraine and that of course because the new globalist comms are that have taken over the country there locking up there there are official left and right the opposition officials locking up before foreign minister just yesterday the reprisals continue what but Alex a few weeks ago you and I were getting fact checked and corrected and were getting really slapped down because what did we say we said that Poland would be used for troops
[01:09:09.492 --> 01:09:09.712]  I think?
[01:09:09.732 --> 01:09:10.312]  I think?
[01:09:39.346 --> 01:09:43.130]  We're going to be simulating conflict with a near-peer competitor.
[01:09:43.170 --> 01:09:48.757]  Okay, that's military speak, that's inter-agency speak for it's going to be a war game with Russia.
[01:09:49.297 --> 01:09:52.741]  They're going to be war game fighting Russia on Ukrainian territory.
[01:09:52.781 --> 01:09:56.506]  Look, you know, I've been to Poland, I've been to Ukraine, I've been very familiar with this region.
[01:09:57.166 --> 01:09:58.706]  I'm good
[01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:22.071]  We're good to go.
[01:10:22.091 --> 01:10:22.331]  I think?
[01:10:22.391 --> 01:10:22.571]  I think?
[01:10:48.036 --> 01:10:48.377]  I think?
[01:10:48.417 --> 01:10:48.597]  I think?
[01:10:48.617 --> 01:10:48.797]  I think?
[01:10:48.817 --> 01:10:48.977]  I think?
[01:10:48.997 --> 01:10:49.197]  I think?
[01:11:03.476 --> 01:11:33.176]  Look, I think Zelinsky is going to come back from this World Economic Forum empty handed and it's very simple because people know inside and outside that Zelinsky isn't the guy calling the shots member the Chinese delegation to the World Economic Forum refused to even meet with Zelinsky he said he said please come and this is like one of their junior diplomats it wasn't even the foreign minister and even that guy said no we're not interested we don't have any room on our schedule for you that shows how far his status has fallen
[01:11:33.610 --> 01:11:34.070]  We're good to go.
[01:11:34.090 --> 01:11:34.630]  I think?
[01:11:34.650 --> 01:11:35.330]  I think?
[01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:35.671]  I think?
[01:11:35.691 --> 01:11:35.911]  I think?
[01:11:35.931 --> 01:11:36.191]  I think?
[01:11:36.211 --> 01:11:36.431]  I think?
[01:11:58.383 --> 01:12:01.785]  Nato does not want a peace deal with Russia.
[01:12:02.226 --> 01:12:05.628]  Nato wants you to go down with the ship.
[01:12:05.948 --> 01:12:06.989]  Do you understand?
[01:12:07.369 --> 01:12:09.531]  You and your country are being used.
[01:12:09.551 --> 01:12:11.292]  You're like the end of the pencil.
[01:12:11.552 --> 01:12:14.894]  They're going to use you down until there's nothing but a nub left.
[01:12:15.254 --> 01:12:23.340]  And then, maybe then, they'll continue on because they've been seeking this wider war with Russia for over a decade now.
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:24.981]  These people are hell bent on it.
[01:12:25.261 --> 01:12:27.222]  People like Victoria Newland, people like...
[01:12:28.063 --> 01:12:29.064]  This is what they want.
[01:12:43.359 --> 01:13:04.484]  Look I said before you know Zalinski's role as a hero there's no juice left there's many water left and that well but there's one card left the play and that's Zalinski as the martyr Zalinski as the victorious martyr who wouldn't leave his country and said don't send me a play and send me I'm own you have these ridiculous people selling tits of him
[01:13:05.425 --> 01:13:05.885]  We're good to go.
[01:13:20.644 --> 01:13:42.527]  This was the exact CIA playbook of South Vietnam with the South Vietnamese Prime Minister Noh Dinh Diem, they used him, he was a hero, he was this great man who was standing up against communism, he was standing up in the fight for freedom, and then all the way to the point where the Tet Offensive happens and then things aren't going well and then whoop, he gets taken out and now he's a martyr and now we gotta send people back over because that's
[01:13:43.107 --> 01:13:44.148]  We've got to do it for him.
[01:13:44.408 --> 01:13:46.889]  So they'll say we have to do it for Zelinsky.
[01:13:46.929 --> 01:13:48.330]  That's why we've got to get involved.
[01:13:48.370 --> 01:13:49.691]  That's why NATO's got to get involved.
[01:13:49.731 --> 01:13:53.413]  That's why Poland has to send its peacekeeping forces in.
[01:13:53.493 --> 01:13:58.296]  Look, all of this, unfortunately, looks like it's unfolding before our eyes, which I was wrong.
[01:13:58.416 --> 01:14:03.899]  I would love to be proven wrong on this stuff, but when I see the headlines every day, it seems like this is the direction we're marching.
[01:14:03.939 --> 01:14:08.161]  You said that three months ago, two months ago, a month ago, you've been 100% dead on, which is frightening.
[01:14:08.902 --> 01:14:10.703]  So looking at this, is there, is there,
[01:14:11.523 --> 01:14:31.762]  Any hope to a peace deal because we hear about peace deals Nelson's he's desperate talking about a peace deal but NATO doesn't want a peace deal we have that as you know build report of four days ago that the top of the German defense ministry was Russia is imminent now we see the call of troops just as we said three weeks ago we have the
[01:14:32.623 --> 01:14:37.348]  Defense Minister of Sweden publicly saying, go buy food and water and gasoline, get ready for war.
[01:14:37.408 --> 01:14:39.830]  You have the British Defense Ministry saying the same thing.
[01:14:40.671 --> 01:14:42.373]  But again, it's not even getting big attention.
[01:14:42.393 --> 01:14:46.457]  They're saying, we're on a war path with Russia, and it should be the top story.
[01:14:46.497 --> 01:14:46.757]  It's not.
[01:14:46.797 --> 01:14:48.138]  So what does all that signify?
[01:14:48.158 --> 01:14:49.760]  And do you think there's a Germany?
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:15:15.079]  This this is a Germany right now is in dire well the German government I should say is in dire straight Olof Scholtz is at the lowest popularity he's ever had in tire change dealership Angle Merkel never got to this point during her entire decade plus in that same role he's basically her air over there you could see the farmers in the streets you could see the tractors we could see the truckers get all into some Polish truckers
[01:15:15.299 --> 01:15:15.720]  We're good to go.
[01:15:31.275 --> 01:15:53.375]  They are rising so much that they're trying to ban them as a party that's your right way your pro your pro national is kind of kind of party over there and so Olaf Shold is in danger of losing his chance or ship when people get desperate like that Alex it pushes them to do desperate things and make desperate moves he'll Mary please
[01:15:53.775 --> 01:15:59.120]  This is the reason that we're starting to see now Germany talk more about getting involved more now.
[01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:01.802]  I appreciate the fact and I'll add this to the analysis.
[01:16:02.648 --> 01:16:29.999]  That the German Budenstag just voted against giving cruise missiles long range cruise missiles to Ukraine and of course that's not coming from Schultz that's coming from the Budenstag because you know what Alex here's the thing the dirty little secret is all of this is happening because Germany cut off their access to low cost energy that they were getting through those pipelines that Nord Stream 2 pipeline which by the way was not blown up by Russia it was blown up look
[01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:31.522]  Obviously with U.S.
[01:16:31.642 --> 01:16:32.043]  assets.
[01:16:32.203 --> 01:16:33.145]  Obviously with U.S.
[01:16:33.185 --> 01:16:33.425]  help.
[01:16:33.706 --> 01:16:35.710]  Probably some Ukrainian forces were involved.
[01:16:36.391 --> 01:16:38.014]  Looks like the operation came out of Poland.
[01:16:38.235 --> 01:16:39.237]  But at the end of the day, look...
[01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:41.922]  You take the industrial espionage out of it.
[01:16:42.202 --> 01:16:42.923]  What was the point?
[01:16:42.963 --> 01:16:46.487]  The goal was the destruction of the industrial core of Germany, right?
[01:16:46.567 --> 01:16:51.532]  All those great German cars that we see around the Volkswagen's, the BMW's, the luxury models, the Audi's.
[01:16:52.093 --> 01:16:58.039]  Well, that's what Newland famously said, as you know, like eight years ago in the tape I record about the Russians, they admit as real.
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:00.302]  They said, hey, a war in Ukraine is going to hurt Europe.
[01:17:00.542 --> 01:17:02.044]  And she said, fuck Europe.
[01:17:03.171 --> 01:17:05.512]  Yeah, look, remember what Lord Ismay said?
[01:17:05.572 --> 01:17:10.695]  The first commander of NATO, Lord Ismay, laid out the policies for NATO.
[01:17:10.715 --> 01:17:12.235]  He said it's very clear, right?
[01:17:12.255 --> 01:17:13.796]  He's a British, uh, British general.
[01:17:14.557 --> 01:17:23.701]  He said the purpose of NATO is to keep Russia out, to keep the US in, and to keep Germany down.
[01:17:24.201 --> 01:17:30.864]  And you look at the way these moves have been playing out for the last two years, it's exactly as he said.
[01:17:32.005 --> 01:17:32.526]  We're good to go.
[01:17:54.895 --> 01:18:11.320]  Well I'd give it maybe a 25% chance but I would say in terms of an actual peace deal but what's actually going to happen is look Ukraine is going to be turned into a rump state and then the real question is will NATO be used as the world police force of the globalist
[01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:12.560]  We're good to go.
[01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:12.800]  I think?
[01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:13.040]  I think?
[01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:13.240]  I think?
[01:18:38.907 --> 01:18:44.130]  They said 20 years ago, we'll use a crisis with Russia to elevate NATO to the world police force.
[01:18:45.411 --> 01:18:46.431]  It's exactly right.
[01:18:46.471 --> 01:18:47.692]  And this is what they've always done.
[01:18:47.732 --> 01:19:03.441]  And this is why when Trump came around and Trump said, look, if the Soviet Union is not around anymore, why don't we turn NATO into a, you know, a counter terrorism organization, a counter trafficking, narco trafficking, sex trafficking, child trafficking, wouldn't that be great if we could all work together, make them sort of like a, you know, an interpol police force.
[01:19:03.741 --> 01:19:04.421]  We're good to go.
[01:19:04.461 --> 01:19:04.701]  I think?
[01:19:30.367 --> 01:19:30.908]  We're good to go.
[01:19:45.544 --> 01:19:46.685]  We're good to go.
[01:19:46.745 --> 01:19:47.085]  I think?
[01:19:47.105 --> 01:19:47.386]  I think?
[01:20:07.341 --> 01:20:30.955]  That's when you potentially see major major pushes and by the way the Russians are massing on their side as well because they know about this look best I would say best case scenario at this point is a Ukraine the split into where you got sort of an East West scenario I'm kind of like Germany at the end of World War II where you get you know East West Germany I think that's probably the best case scenario and then a frozen conflict
[01:20:31.355 --> 01:20:32.036]  We're good to go.
[01:20:43.632 --> 01:20:47.433]  Yeah, the absolute worst case scenario is the invocation of Article 5 and it always has been.
[01:20:47.473 --> 01:20:50.514]  And this is why you see people constantly attempting.
[01:20:50.694 --> 01:20:57.935]  Look, you create Zelinsky went to the World Economic Forum and went up there and said your troops need to come over here and fight our war.
[01:20:58.176 --> 01:21:04.957]  He said that on the stage in Switzerland in Davos standing extra clash swab your troops need to fight our war.
[01:21:04.977 --> 01:21:07.978]  And now you are true that mean he's talking about Article 5.
[01:21:08.618 --> 01:21:33.041]  That's right and now US troops being mobilized part of this NATO up working show in the 7 minutes we have left for 6 minutes let's hit the credible balance you said months ago a few like a week after October said this is an Iranian Chinese trap were being learned in look from the attack to Red Sea close trade or most now it's all I ran as it Pakistan Pakistan I ran I mean this is the stuff of World War 3.
[01:21:34.264 --> 01:21:39.869]  Well Alex, it is the stuff of World War 3, but I want to remind people to go play that game of the map again, right?
[01:21:40.049 --> 01:21:41.450]  It's all about the maps.
[01:21:41.531 --> 01:21:42.872]  It's all about the maps, right?
[01:21:42.892 --> 01:21:44.894]  The maps will cut through the rhetoric.
[01:21:45.174 --> 01:21:46.995]  So where is Balochistan?
[01:21:47.015 --> 01:21:53.381]  So Balochistan is the separatist group that operates on both sides of the border between Pakistan and Iran.
[01:21:53.601 --> 01:21:56.584]  But what, and so they attack Iranians, they attack the Pakistanis.
[01:21:56.824 --> 01:22:06.158]  But at the same time, you've got Pakistan's ISI military over there, their military intelligence, which are directly tied to the CIA, constantly used to provocate against Iran.
[01:22:06.458 --> 01:22:09.864]  Iran provocates back, and then they blame it on the Balochistan separatists.
[01:22:09.904 --> 01:22:12.007]  These are intel operations going against each other.
[01:22:12.447 --> 01:22:17.229]  And so, when you're looking at this, what is it directly across from, Alex?
[01:22:17.369 --> 01:22:20.169]  It's directly across from the Strait of Hormuz.
[01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:22.790]  This is why this area is so key.
[01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:31.313]  Because if they are able to send missiles back and forth on that side of the border, now you're at the mouth of the Persian Gulf.
[01:22:31.693 --> 01:22:47.377]  The mouth of the oil flow of the entire world if they're able to shut that down on either side whether it's whether it's Pakistan so you know that CIA sending a message and then Iran sending their message right back saying we are willing to fight back whatever you do
[01:22:48.271 --> 01:22:51.214]  Okay, now you've got all of the competing interests again.
[01:22:51.754 --> 01:22:56.318]  This is the friction point like like two tectonic plates.
[01:22:56.459 --> 01:23:00.482]  This is the tectonic friction line between the empires.
[01:23:00.742 --> 01:23:07.849]  So you've got Persia and then you've got Pakistan which is still aligned with the globalist American empire on something but at the same time.
[01:23:08.249 --> 01:23:11.990]  Pakistan is kind of a wild card because they've also got direct ties.
[01:23:12.191 --> 01:23:15.092]  It was right across their border in China.
[01:23:15.132 --> 01:23:16.992]  So this is a very, very dangerous.
[01:23:17.032 --> 01:23:18.653]  And this is how world wars break out.
[01:23:18.673 --> 01:23:21.474]  I know that I, this is exactly how world wars break out.
[01:23:21.494 --> 01:23:25.315]  It's exactly how world war one broke out because you had secret alliances.
[01:23:25.335 --> 01:23:31.318]  You had national security agencies all playing games with each other while the people were kept in the middle.
[01:23:31.538 --> 01:23:32.418]  Incredibly dangerous.
[01:23:32.658 --> 01:23:33.258]  All right.
[01:23:33.298 --> 01:23:37.180]  Let's let's let's hit the pipe bomb news because you've been all over this being a federal drift.
[01:23:38.371 --> 01:24:03.787]  Draw resources away right this photo that that human events received from a source very late last night who you know I'll just say it's a federal source that sent this in and look you know anybody who's been in military intelligence or federal law enforcement I ran with you be a couple times in a different parts of the world where I was deployed as an Intel officer attached to you the unit
[01:24:04.667 --> 01:24:05.628]  I think?
[01:24:05.648 --> 01:24:05.948]  I think?
[01:24:05.968 --> 01:24:06.128]  I think?
[01:24:31.741 --> 01:24:34.442]  To take it seriously and you have to call it in as it is.
[01:24:34.502 --> 01:24:50.789]  Of course, the other big news that we get and so the photo that I posted, which does come from a federal facility, is the exact same end caps, the exact same pipes, the exact same timers that you see on the pipe bomb, which is recovered on January 6th, planted, of course, January 5th.
[01:24:51.189 --> 01:24:57.312]  The real question now, the biggest question, I know Darren Beattie, we're going to have him on the show on Human Events later today, is the timing.
[01:24:58.582 --> 01:25:07.590]  Alex, the timing of this was exactly, the timing of the finding of the pipe bomb was exactly as people were first, those first early waves were penetrating.
[01:25:08.485 --> 01:25:09.065]  We're good to go.
[01:25:34.171 --> 01:25:35.092]  We're good to go.
[01:25:57.332 --> 01:25:58.613]  From your own research, Jack.
[01:25:58.633 --> 01:26:05.856]  Oh, and I haven't said it yet, I haven't said it yet, but the very thing on this is that we've always been told it was a passerby who made that phone call in.
[01:26:06.176 --> 01:26:09.297]  Now we know that it was a plain-clothed law enforcement officer.
[01:26:09.337 --> 01:26:10.778]  And why do they try to cover that up, Jack?
[01:26:12.182 --> 01:26:13.443]  That's a great question, Alex.
[01:26:13.803 --> 01:26:17.985]  That's a great question, because I'd love to know, were you really just walking by there?
[01:26:18.225 --> 01:26:22.006]  Were you really just walking by, deciding to take a look at the back of that fence?
[01:26:22.427 --> 01:26:26.168]  Or did someone tell you to go look behind the... Hey, man.
[01:26:26.508 --> 01:26:27.989]  Hey, go check behind the bench.
[01:26:28.029 --> 01:26:29.210]  Did you get a text message?
[01:26:29.470 --> 01:26:31.151]  Did you get an anonymous tip?
[01:26:31.491 --> 01:26:36.393]  Boy, I'd really love if the house GOP were able to find this guy and haul him in
[01:26:36.673 --> 01:26:37.754]  I was even planning on talking about it!
[01:26:57.868 --> 01:27:27.402]  I wasn't even plan and bring it up I said I said yeah will get to it was if we get something I get this photo and then we find out about the police officer I said this this is real okay this is all happening this is all happening it's breaking real time I know talker and Darren B are going to drop in later tonight around 6pm Eastern I don't know what they're going to talk about I have been told they've been really big analysis piece coming out that isn even involved with the plain close officer or this pipe on for that we had but I did talk to another EOD officer
[01:27:28.206 --> 01:27:31.267]  Guy who I served with, and he said to me, look, he said, Jack, here's what it is.
[01:27:31.687 --> 01:27:46.211]  The fact that it's a training aid is meant so that if another law enforcement trained guy, like a bomb disposal guy, EOD guy, explosive ordnance disposal guy finds this, then they would readily identify, snap their fingers, they would know that's not a real pipe bomb.
[01:27:46.471 --> 01:27:52.372]  So it's almost like a signal to other federal law enforcement that hey, this was planted by one of ours.
[01:27:52.792 --> 01:27:53.913]  We got 30 seconds, 40 seconds left.
[01:27:55.598 --> 01:27:56.419]  Trump's dominating.
[01:27:56.439 --> 01:27:58.180]  30 seconds on the campaign.
[01:28:14.324 --> 01:28:43.981]  Of course Trump had an absolute domineering presence in Iowa they said I was going to be close it wasn't close at all as a 30 point blow out New Hampshire they are trying a lot of tricks up there this is what and then Jamie Diamond all right Jamie Diamond coming out by the way yesterday over Davos this little Ukraine flag pin saying all I'm very interested in you know Maga movement hey let me be your secretary the treasury and then he turns around and he starts saying how bad crypto is in Satoshi's laughing to you and all this stuff
[01:28:44.241 --> 01:28:45.743]  Look, we know what's going on.
[01:28:45.983 --> 01:28:51.109]  Alex, the next threat of all of this is that the snakes are going to try to get back in.
[01:28:51.169 --> 01:28:55.154]  People like Jamie Dimon, who by the way, was Jeffrey Epstein's banker.
[01:28:55.174 --> 01:28:56.075]  That's right.
[01:28:56.115 --> 01:28:57.217]  Great job, Jack Posobiec.
[01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:00.180]  29 years on air.
[01:29:00.501 --> 01:29:03.482]  All I've wanted to do is warn the people about the globalist.
[01:29:04.202 --> 01:29:09.524]  And I've done the best job I can to tell them inaccurate and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[01:29:09.904 --> 01:29:12.464]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves.
[01:29:12.885 --> 01:29:16.346]  I'm like other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people.
[01:29:16.586 --> 01:29:17.266]  We don't do that.
[01:29:17.746 --> 01:29:19.627]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[01:29:20.007 --> 01:29:22.648]  And ladies and gentlemen I'm scared of this product it's so powerful.
[01:29:23.568 --> 01:29:28.574]  This is the breakdown product, after your cells process it, of folic acid.
[01:29:29.155 --> 01:29:33.620]  Methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[01:29:34.081 --> 01:29:35.322]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[01:29:35.362 --> 01:29:36.544]  It's not a stimulant.
[01:29:36.684 --> 01:29:38.286]  It energizes your cells.
[01:29:38.786 --> 01:29:39.227]  We're good to go.
[01:29:39.267 --> 01:29:39.487]  I think?
[01:29:39.547 --> 01:29:39.867]  I think?
[01:29:39.887 --> 01:29:40.067]  I think?
[01:29:59.315 --> 01:30:08.650]  You know, I sit up here and I yell and scream about the New World Order and the Globus, they're planning to get rid of the borders and release a virus and have a global power grab and you saw it all come true.
[01:30:09.771 --> 01:30:10.513]  But there's a...
[01:30:11.647 --> 01:30:12.428]  inverse of that.
[01:30:13.168 --> 01:30:15.850]  There's not just the bad stuff I'm telling you about.
[01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:18.151]  There's the good stuff I'm telling you about.
[01:30:18.912 --> 01:30:21.794]  And just like our information is the best you're going to find out there.
[01:30:22.314 --> 01:30:23.555]  Our supplements are amazing.
[01:30:24.195 --> 01:30:27.958]  So our new special the last half of January 2024 is here.
[01:30:28.478 --> 01:30:32.821]  It's a real bill plus and DNA force plus both 50% off.
[01:30:32.981 --> 01:30:36.063]  We're calling it the supercharged special.
[01:30:36.723 --> 01:30:41.989]  You can get either one of these great items at 40% off individually or together for 50% off.
[01:30:42.289 --> 01:30:46.753]  Now, the time we have left, I can't tell you why they're so great and what they do to your body.

[01:30:59.022 --> 01:31:02.765]  Why do you think the globalist are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[01:31:03.085 --> 01:31:06.247]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[01:31:06.647 --> 01:31:11.131]  Because they can get through this giant Meglin Michael power grab and we're exposing him.
[01:31:11.751 --> 01:31:22.178]  But we're not just exposing their operation in my new book we give you the solutions to build a new better world an alternative to Klaus Schwab's you will eat the bugs.
[01:31:22.799 --> 01:31:24.120]  This is the great awakening.
[01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:28.525]  The plan to defeat the Globist and launch the second great renaissance.
[01:31:29.005 --> 01:31:30.487]  It's a companion to my last book.
[01:31:30.767 --> 01:31:32.529]  It was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[01:31:32.789 --> 01:31:35.312]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.
[01:31:35.653 --> 01:31:39.497]  Get your copy of The Great Awakening today at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:39.497 --> 01:31:39.957]  We're good to go.
[01:31:59.881 --> 01:32:11.690]  We're in the middle of a crude and ugly communist revolution, funded by the big banks as a battering ram into a new age digital economy and a total surveillance state.
[01:32:12.130 --> 01:32:20.157]  All branches of government are attacking we the people and they offer us only one option, a meaningless vote in a rigged election.
[01:32:21.037 --> 01:32:22.898]  What we can do is be prepared.
[01:32:23.378 --> 01:32:31.720]  And you can support the Infowar by shopping at infowarstore.com for products to help you through good times and bad.
[01:32:32.501 --> 01:32:35.301]  And you can share the videos at band.video.
[01:32:35.922 --> 01:32:41.223]  Our best hope still is and always has been a mass awakening.
[01:32:41.683 --> 01:32:42.924]  So download the videos.
[01:32:43.744 --> 01:32:47.365]  Share them, upload them, and send them everywhere.
[01:32:48.045 --> 01:32:51.666]  Let the world unite for truth, justice, and 1776 worldwide.
[01:33:15.942 --> 01:33:34.496]  If you go to the Drudge Report, and I think it'll still be up, there's a story that talks about Trump having hand cuts, and you can link to it.
[01:33:34.696 --> 01:33:38.399]  They don't look like cuts to me, they look like sores.
[01:33:39.498 --> 01:33:48.984]  And I've asked a number of MDs what medical condition manifests itself through hand sores, and the answer is immediate and unanimous.
[01:33:49.524 --> 01:33:50.705]  Secondary syphilis.
[01:33:51.546 --> 01:33:54.628]  All right, I think there's a good chance this man has the clap.
[01:33:55.228 --> 01:33:57.730]  And I'm not being particularly secretive about it.
[01:33:58.430 --> 01:34:00.571]  I am texting the photo.
[01:34:00.852 --> 01:34:07.416]  You can link to it in some operation called a daily mail or some British thing, probably a fleet street ride.
[01:34:08.351 --> 01:34:19.478]  You know, maybe the picture was doctored, or whatever, but maybe this story goes somewhere, maybe it won't, but I'm telling you at one o'clock east, and I'm humping this thing like a young dog on old furniture.
[01:34:20.098 --> 01:34:21.799]  Golfers Vasculitis.
[01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:23.740]  That's what Trump has.
[01:34:24.881 --> 01:34:32.045]  And we see desperate Democrat party operative, James Carvel, putting out videos, and drugs report, and others picking it up.
[01:34:32.306 --> 01:34:33.766]  This Trump have syphus.
[01:34:34.327 --> 01:34:36.108]  The instant I saw his hand.
[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:37.461]  We're good to go.
[01:34:52.216 --> 01:35:01.683]  If you're around of course, walk up and talk to golfers out of 10 of them, 2 or 3 will have tape on their fingers on their thumbs and you'll ask what's wrong I'll say I've got golfers rash.
[01:35:02.443 --> 01:35:18.915]  So you can see it's perfect golfers rash the way you hold it and the stroke when you come in puts a lot of pressure on the index finger and on the thumb and right here he has golfers rash the man plays up to two complete 18 rounds a day.
[01:35:19.798 --> 01:35:20.399]  Do that twice.
[01:35:20.799 --> 01:35:23.722]  He is a top scratch golfer, almost professional.
[01:35:24.083 --> 01:35:25.524]  And this isn't about even defending Trump.
[01:35:25.564 --> 01:35:27.807]  It's about defending reality.
[01:35:27.827 --> 01:35:28.828]  And I am sick of it.
[01:35:28.848 --> 01:35:30.810]  These people are so desperate.
[01:35:31.491 --> 01:35:38.258]  They've got all these kangaroo courts, rigged events, trials without juries, all the indictments.
[01:35:38.879 --> 01:35:39.860]  He's a Russian spy.
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:40.560]  Women are a pawn.
[01:35:41.582 --> 01:35:44.803]  None of it's true, ladies and gentlemen, and none of the things they've said about me are true either.
[01:35:45.103 --> 01:35:49.284]  They're a lying pack of scum, and Carvel has no shame.
[01:35:49.744 --> 01:35:51.644]  President Trump is a golfer.
[01:35:52.024 --> 01:35:53.645]  It's his golfing hand.
[01:35:54.125 --> 01:35:56.285]  The one that grips down the furthest is the right hand.
[01:35:56.685 --> 01:35:58.046]  That's where you tend to get it.
[01:35:58.446 --> 01:35:59.186]  Everybody knows it.
[01:35:59.426 --> 01:36:01.246]  He doesn't have syphilis.
[01:36:02.627 --> 01:36:08.448]  All right, I'll be covering this live today at 11 AM Central Infowars.com 4 Slash Show, and follow me at Real Alex Jones here on X.
[01:36:18.953 --> 01:36:24.178]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[01:36:24.658 --> 01:36:29.002]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[01:36:30.884 --> 01:36:37.731]  Avi Yemeni joins us in T-minus 23 and a half minutes from Davos on a mountaintop in Switzerland.
[01:36:38.511 --> 01:36:40.033]  He's got a bunch of new clips he sent us.
[01:36:40.794 --> 01:36:43.196]  More confrontations just happened.
[01:36:49.025 --> 01:36:52.927]  You don't normally play a report twice in a show, but I shot that before it went live today at 11 a.m.
[01:36:52.967 --> 01:36:54.107]  Central an hour and a half ago.
[01:36:55.288 --> 01:37:01.171]  They're saying Trump has syphilis when he's clearly got a golfer rash, right where you get it on your hand for playing golf.
[01:37:02.511 --> 01:37:08.554]  And we know they're liars, but it just shows there's no desperate level they won't go to.
[01:37:10.575 --> 01:37:17.999]  Now I've got all this other news I want to hit, but we have the murder of our judicial system.
[01:37:19.471 --> 01:37:25.334]  And the weaponization of it, the murder of justice, and the full capture of our judicial system in many areas.
[01:37:25.814 --> 01:37:28.175]  They don't control the Supreme Court totally, that's why they're in panic mode.
[01:37:29.116 --> 01:37:42.222]  But they've got so many of these other courts, federal and state around the country, and you have this Carol lady, who decades later, never followed police reports, says Trump grabbed her at a shopping mall closet.
[01:37:43.963 --> 01:37:46.284]  And Trump says, I'm innocent, which is everybody's right to say.
[01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:58.164]  So she sues him not for rape, because there's no evidence of that, but for defaming her when she attacked him and she's a Democratic Party operative.
[01:38:01.526 --> 01:38:07.308]  And then she sues him again for saying he's innocent again, but he's out in state and says he's innocent again.
[01:38:10.424 --> 01:38:12.986]  And then you've got Mitt Romney saying Republicans are evil.
[01:38:13.326 --> 01:38:14.186]  He's always been a Democrat.
[01:38:14.206 --> 01:38:15.507]  Mitt Romney's the worst.
[01:38:16.288 --> 01:38:19.129]  Because they'll vote for a rapist who's been found guilty of rape.
[01:38:19.449 --> 01:38:19.990]  He hasn't.
[01:38:20.590 --> 01:38:24.092]  A jury in New York where the judge wouldn't let Trump put on a defense.
[01:38:24.513 --> 01:38:26.474]  He's now asking again at the second trial to talk.
[01:38:26.614 --> 01:38:27.394]  Judge is saying no.
[01:38:27.774 --> 01:38:29.375]  Just like in New York with the real estate.
[01:38:30.256 --> 01:38:31.577]  It's insane ladies and gentlemen.
[01:38:32.597 --> 01:38:35.519]  And then the media says oh he's so bad he's mad in the court.
[01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:40.002]  Trump has warned he may be ejected from current trial.
[01:38:41.052 --> 01:38:42.553]  Because he's moving around too much.
[01:38:44.095 --> 01:38:48.478]  Mitt Romney rips out of touch with reality Trump voters.
[01:38:48.878 --> 01:38:54.923]  Mitt Romney rips out of touch with reality voters who don't care a jury found Trump raped a woman.
[01:38:54.963 --> 01:38:57.786]  Now they found he defamed her by saying he was innocent.
[01:38:59.527 --> 01:39:10.016]  So Mitt Romney says you can't say you're innocent as if he fools us that he's a Republican when we all know
[01:39:12.418 --> 01:39:17.280]  What he is, is an establishment globalist.
[01:39:17.300 --> 01:39:17.280]  100%.
[01:39:18.761 --> 01:39:20.541]  Through and through, shame on Mitt Romney.
[01:39:22.562 --> 01:39:24.143]  Here's Trump on True Social.
[01:39:24.223 --> 01:39:25.883]  I've said it once and I'll say it again.
[01:39:25.943 --> 01:39:31.026]  A thousand times until this ridiculous hoax was revealed to me by Fox News Media.
[01:39:31.166 --> 01:39:34.047]  I never heard of Jean, of E. Jean Curl.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:35.901]  Never had anything with her.
[01:39:36.421 --> 01:39:38.503]  Never would want to have anything to do with her.
[01:39:38.923 --> 01:39:44.007]  Never brought her into a locked changing room at a crowded New York City department store.
[01:39:44.627 --> 01:39:46.128]  Directly opposed the check out booth.
[01:39:46.389 --> 01:39:47.329]  I never touched her.
[01:39:48.130 --> 01:39:50.532]  Or anyway would want to touch her.
[01:39:51.252 --> 01:39:53.734]  The whole story is made up and disgusting hoax.
[01:39:54.295 --> 01:39:56.836]  Like a now fully discredited rusher rusher rusher hoax.
[01:39:57.237 --> 01:39:59.819]  And all the others this one is also
[01:40:01.288 --> 01:40:01.628]  I think?
[01:40:01.688 --> 01:40:02.089]  I think?
[01:40:02.109 --> 01:40:02.289]  I think?
[01:40:32.125 --> 01:40:32.946]  Now that E.G.
[01:40:33.006 --> 01:40:59.687]  Carol is admitted to illegal deleting and destroying mountains as well as it seems unoffly only gone in my admission if judge list cap and does the right thing a patriotic thing he will immediately dismissed the current election interference which on trial which the reverse was unfair based on result the first sham trial which was forced upon a very popular successful president United States of America me the crooked job I
[01:41:01.001 --> 01:41:06.323]  This credit conspiracy of hoaxes and scams is falling apart, like a rotten house of cards, make America great again.
[01:41:10.224 --> 01:41:12.444]  Have you watched this woman's videos online?
[01:41:12.565 --> 01:41:15.545]  I mean we're talking a full-on cuckoo bird.
[01:41:19.367 --> 01:41:21.687]  No witnesses he ever met her, no witnesses any other.
[01:41:22.427 --> 01:41:23.128]  Does it matter?
[01:41:23.648 --> 01:41:27.029]  Jury say you're not allowed to say you're innocent.
[01:41:28.018 --> 01:41:29.018]  Since when are you not allowed?
[01:41:29.058 --> 01:41:30.539]  Since when saying I'm innocent?
[01:41:30.639 --> 01:41:31.439]  I don't know you?
[01:41:32.059 --> 01:41:33.179]  Since when is that?
[01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:37.500]  Defamation.
[01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:41.761]  Well it's these jurisdictions where they control the juries.
[01:41:42.701 --> 01:41:44.021]  And I've been through this myself.
[01:41:45.582 --> 01:41:47.382]  They had daily mail articles 5 years ago.
[01:41:49.823 --> 01:41:52.263]  Saying I did things and said things that I never did 1% of.
[01:41:52.563 --> 01:41:53.743]  It was all 100% made up.
[01:42:01.496 --> 01:42:05.538]  They claim I grabbed a woman's ass in my break room and said I want to have a baby with you.
[01:42:05.558 --> 01:42:09.601]  100% not true.
[01:42:11.022 --> 01:42:15.584]  They said that there was a fish tank in the office and I was a bad employee so I grabbed their fish and ate it.
[01:42:16.165 --> 01:42:17.085]  Never had a fish tank here.
[01:42:17.506 --> 01:42:19.107]  That's from Wolf of Wall Street, folks.
[01:42:20.362 --> 01:42:24.483]  And I have all these witnesses that I've been able to work to since this office was opened 15 years ago.
[01:42:24.503 --> 01:42:25.843]  In these studios.
[01:42:26.363 --> 01:42:28.024]  There's never been a pet here.
[01:42:28.664 --> 01:42:29.904]  A few times we've brought their dogs.
[01:42:30.144 --> 01:42:31.285]  There's never been a fish tank.
[01:42:32.985 --> 01:42:33.705]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:42:34.465 --> 01:42:36.106]  It just sounds evil, doesn't it?
[01:42:37.946 --> 01:42:40.327]  So I'm gonna play a clip of her when we come back, I'll rape a sexy.
[01:42:41.747 --> 01:42:43.088]  Then she starts hitting on Anderson Cooper.
[01:42:43.108 --> 01:42:46.108]  These people are sick.
[01:42:48.269 --> 01:42:48.869]  Extremely sick.
[01:42:50.618 --> 01:42:52.779]  But they're discredent and people know they're full of crap.
[01:42:53.799 --> 01:42:55.460]  We have a right to say we think you're full of crap.
[01:43:05.282 --> 01:43:05.362]  FB.
[01:43:05.382 --> 01:43:05.502]  FG.
[01:43:05.522 --> 01:43:05.562]  FG.
[01:43:05.582 --> 01:43:05.622]  FG.
[01:43:33.678 --> 01:43:33.938]  I think?
[01:43:34.018 --> 01:43:34.419]  I think?
[01:43:34.439 --> 01:43:34.919]  I think?
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:35.320]  I think?
[01:43:35.340 --> 01:43:35.740]  I think?
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:36.000]  I think?
[01:43:58.533 --> 01:44:03.856]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing high quality coffee has not been available.
[01:44:04.297 --> 01:44:08.680]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:11.602]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[01:44:12.162 --> 01:44:21.548]  But now we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran owned and veteran operated.
[01:44:21.748 --> 01:44:24.370]  It's powered by the company Minute Man Coffee.
[01:44:24.990 --> 01:44:33.018]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best-tasting, best-smelling, strongest coffee that I have ever drank.
[01:44:33.498 --> 01:44:34.899]  It is game-changing.

[01:45:59.522 --> 01:46:02.644]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[01:46:02.664 --> 01:46:04.185]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:46:04.966 --> 01:46:07.988]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:46:08.008 --> 01:46:16.994]  But when we talk about the crew Infowars, people behind the seats, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVP's in this fight.
[01:46:17.834 --> 01:46:23.798]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Shroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, 5, 6, 7 days a week.
[01:46:24.719 --> 01:46:25.620]  It's really just incredible.
[01:46:26.630 --> 01:46:29.491]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:46:29.511 --> 01:46:35.274]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:46:36.054 --> 01:46:39.055]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[01:46:39.095 --> 01:46:47.339]  But most viewers and listeners never go to Infowarsstore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time, just on air.
[01:46:47.959 --> 01:46:48.119]  I think?
[01:46:48.139 --> 01:46:48.359]  I think?
[01:46:48.439 --> 01:46:48.760]  I think?
[01:47:19.224 --> 01:47:25.787]  Oh, we're back in the New World Order.
[01:47:27.568 --> 01:47:29.229]  Oh, Father!
[01:47:29.389 --> 01:47:32.011]  I will never see the light of Lucifer.
[01:47:32.031 --> 01:47:36.073]  I only see the light of God.
[01:47:36.433 --> 01:47:38.654]  I don't see the false light.
[01:47:39.314 --> 01:47:40.295]  I see the real light.
[01:47:47.836 --> 01:47:54.642]  But if you wanna find help me, I'm gonna show you what it's like.
[01:47:55.883 --> 01:47:59.386]  Till you're bleeding, New World Order.
[01:48:00.007 --> 01:48:01.668]  The battle is now.
[01:48:02.389 --> 01:48:04.291]  Stop bowing to their propaganda.
[01:48:04.331 --> 01:48:06.372]  Stop bowing to their intimidation.
[01:48:06.412 --> 01:48:08.855]  Stop bowing to their lies.
[01:48:09.095 --> 01:48:13.479]  We all know President Trump didn't assault that woman.
[01:48:14.935 --> 01:48:17.397]  We all know it worked for the Russians.
[01:48:18.097 --> 01:48:20.679]  We all know I'm not any of America.
[01:48:21.940 --> 01:48:26.382]  And we all know you out there listening and watching want freedom.
[01:48:30.065 --> 01:48:32.026]  We've got to stop bowing and he's scum.
[01:48:33.007 --> 01:48:35.188]  Let's play a clip of this kook.
[01:48:37.049 --> 01:48:38.991]  Where Trump can't say he's innocent.
[01:48:39.551 --> 01:48:40.411]  Here's Carol.
[01:48:41.412 --> 01:48:43.634]  Literally having a psychotic meltdown on CNN.
[01:48:46.340 --> 01:48:47.001]  I don't feel like a victim.
[01:48:47.421 --> 01:48:49.202]  I was not thrown on the ground and ravished.
[01:48:49.763 --> 01:48:53.706]  Which, the word rape carries so many sexual connotations.
[01:48:53.986 --> 01:48:56.649]  This was not, this was not sexual.
[01:48:57.449 --> 01:48:58.830]  It just, it, it hurt.
[01:48:59.030 --> 01:49:00.652]  It just, what, it just, you know.
[01:49:00.672 --> 01:49:05.256]  But I think most people think of rape as a, I mean it is a violent assault.
[01:49:05.336 --> 01:49:05.716]  It is not.
[01:49:05.756 --> 01:49:08.018]  I think most people think of rape as being sexy.
[01:49:08.058 --> 01:49:10.600]  Let's take a short break.
[01:49:10.620 --> 01:49:11.561]  Think of the fantasies.
[01:49:16.058 --> 01:49:17.618]  No one's allowed to say they don't believe you.
[01:49:17.679 --> 01:49:18.919]  No one's allowed to say they're innocent.
[01:49:19.799 --> 01:49:24.401]  Or you'll have some clerk jury with some Democrat judge charge you $10,000,000.
[01:49:31.923 --> 01:49:33.543]  She saw that her book wasn't selling.
[01:49:34.564 --> 01:49:35.764]  So she made the accusation.
[01:49:35.804 --> 01:49:36.904]  Put that headline back up there.
[01:49:37.725 --> 01:49:39.925]  And look, I know you already know this folks.
[01:49:39.965 --> 01:49:41.526]  You gotta really get down to brass tacks.
[01:49:43.168 --> 01:49:46.270]  You know, I'm not a big fan of the UFC.
[01:49:46.290 --> 01:49:47.551]  I'm not against people fighting.
[01:49:47.691 --> 01:49:48.892]  I'm not against combat sports.
[01:49:48.952 --> 01:49:49.733]  I'm not against sports.
[01:49:49.793 --> 01:49:53.456]  I just don't spend my time because I'm in the big battle against the New Order.
[01:49:53.496 --> 01:49:59.720]  But I get California trying to ban contact football for little kids is the nanny state of control.
[01:50:00.001 --> 01:50:01.522]  I think sports is great for kids.
[01:50:01.542 --> 01:50:02.463]  I think football's great.
[01:50:02.763 --> 01:50:03.764]  I think tracks great.
[01:50:03.784 --> 01:50:04.664]  I think basketball's great.
[01:50:04.684 --> 01:50:05.465]  I think baseball's great.
[01:50:05.485 --> 01:50:06.245]  I think golf's great.
[01:50:06.466 --> 01:50:07.246]  I think wrestling's great.
[01:50:07.266 --> 01:50:08.107]  I think boxing's great.
[01:50:09.252 --> 01:50:23.364]  It just can't be the only thing you focus on, but now California, I'll cover this coming up, has a bill and the majority of votes, the governor's gonna have to veto it, because it's just so obvious how evil it is, to ban football in California.
[01:50:24.885 --> 01:50:29.529]  Well, I like what Sean Strickland, the middleweight, heavyweight champion, and I want to get him on the show, by the way.
[01:50:30.270 --> 01:50:31.351]  I want him on the show.
[01:50:31.391 --> 01:50:34.753]  I'd probably call Joe Rogan and get his number, but that's who I want on.
[01:50:37.076 --> 01:50:37.556]  Producers?
[01:50:38.197 --> 01:50:39.417]  Alright, you heard that?
[01:50:40.298 --> 01:50:44.520]  I know we've got to organize everything else out there, but I want him on the show.
[01:50:45.581 --> 01:50:48.302]  And you can say he's brash, you can say he's mean, but here's the deal.
[01:50:48.382 --> 01:50:53.685]  I don't hate an adult that's transgender, but I don't endorse it being push in society and culture against children.
[01:50:55.029 --> 01:51:20.567]  But also then support what he's saying and that it's his free speech and this is the attitude when you get up there's a fighter who's the middle way heavyweight champion and he's left us bring up him about all your stance on the family our families are under attack it about gay marriage they want to control our lives it's a fact it's a cult we're going to recruit your children we're going to your children this is a sick cult
[01:51:21.937 --> 01:51:29.539]  So I think President Trump should pick Sean Strickland, UFC middleweight champion, as his VP.
[01:51:32.092 --> 01:51:34.734]  Uh, we've got a pretty supportive gay and lesbian community in this city.
[01:51:34.834 --> 01:51:36.875]  I did want to ask you about something you wrote a couple of years ago.
[01:51:36.935 --> 01:51:43.019]  You said if I had a gay son, I would think I'd... Oh, look, another, another... I'm saying he's a swamp, you guys, a swamp.
[01:51:43.099 --> 01:51:46.181]  You've become a champion, you've become a star, and some would say... Let me ask you something.
[01:51:46.201 --> 01:51:47.782]  Are you, are you, are you gay?
[01:51:48.363 --> 01:51:51.405]  No, are you, are you, let me know, are you gay?
[01:51:51.425 --> 01:51:52.285]  Can I get an answer?
[01:51:52.305 --> 01:51:54.887]  Well, now I'm asking, this is a part of, are you, are you a gay man?
[01:51:54.947 --> 01:51:56.128]  I'm an ally of the community.
[01:51:56.428 --> 01:52:02.173]  Okay, if you had a son and he was like, you know, he had a son, he was gay, you'd be like, oh man, you don't, you don't want a grandkid?
[01:52:02.213 --> 01:52:02.754]  No problem with it.
[01:52:03.174 --> 01:52:05.556]  Oh man, well, you're a weak f**king man, dude.
[01:52:05.576 --> 01:52:07.678]  You're like, you're part of the f**king problem.
[01:52:07.718 --> 01:52:13.844]  You elected Justin Trudeau, like, when you f**king, when he seized the bank accounts, like, you're just f**king pathetic.
[01:52:14.524 --> 01:52:37.422]  And and the fact that the fact that you have no fucking backbone and and as he shut down your fucking country and sees bank accounts you ask me some stupid shit like that go fuck yourself move the fuck on man I don't have a question but I didn't want to sell you said about the trans community said this past over when they have the Bud Light sponsorship that you go so hard on Bud Light your next fight they'll have to accept me or to announce me
[01:52:38.482 --> 01:52:43.385]  When they know what they stand for... This guy's like, this Canadian's not that Canadian.
[01:52:43.485 --> 01:52:45.386]  Are you still going to use your fight time to kind of speak on that?
[01:52:45.506 --> 01:52:46.707]  Here's the thing about Bud Light.
[01:52:46.727 --> 01:52:50.469]  Here's the thing about Bud Light.
[01:52:53.090 --> 01:52:55.111]  Ten years ago, to be trans was a what?
[01:52:55.251 --> 01:52:56.572]  A mental f***ing illness.
[01:52:56.792 --> 01:53:00.894]  And now all of a sudden, people like you have f***ing weasled your way in the world.
[01:53:03.035 --> 01:53:05.016]  You are... You are an infection.
[01:53:06.022 --> 01:53:09.025]  You are the definition of weakness.
[01:53:09.245 --> 01:53:12.828]  Everything that is wrong with the world is because of f**king you.
[01:53:13.569 --> 01:53:16.271]  And the best thing is, is the world's not buying it.
[01:53:16.431 --> 01:53:19.474]  The world's not buying your f**king bulls**t, your f**king peddling.
[01:53:20.055 --> 01:53:21.496]  The world is not saying, you know what?
[01:53:21.996 --> 01:53:24.098]  You're right, f**king chicks have dicks.
[01:53:24.138 --> 01:53:25.019]  The world's not saying that.
[01:53:25.039 --> 01:53:26.921]  The world's saying, no, there are two genders.
[01:53:27.814 --> 01:53:31.657]  I don't want my kids being taught about, you know, who they could f**king school.
[01:53:31.717 --> 01:53:35.660]  I don't want my kids being taught about, you know, their sexual preference.
[01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:38.342]  Like, dude, this guy is a f**king enemy.
[01:53:38.902 --> 01:53:41.364]  You want to look at the f**king enemy to our world?
[01:53:41.864 --> 01:53:43.245]  It's that motherf**ker right there.
[01:53:45.227 --> 01:53:50.390]  Well, I'm officially endorsing Sean Strickland for the Vice President of the United States.
[01:53:55.256 --> 01:54:17.591]  But if you wanna find help me I'm gonna show you what it's like Till you're bleedin' Till you're bleedin' I'm not about to see your light But if you wanna find help me I'm gonna show you what it's like
[01:54:22.817 --> 01:54:26.800]  Everything they've done to crush us has only made us stronger.
[01:54:27.220 --> 01:54:36.967]  As Nietzsche said, that which does not kill us only makes us stronger.
[01:54:40.049 --> 01:54:41.190]  They fear our spirit.
[01:54:42.631 --> 01:54:43.692]  They are scum.
[01:54:45.473 --> 01:54:47.595]  And we will win.
[01:54:53.513 --> 01:54:59.536]  Alright, we got loaded news, loaded information, loaded intel on the New World Order.
[01:54:59.616 --> 01:55:00.796]  We know how to beat them.
[01:55:01.397 --> 01:55:05.979]  When I tell you I got their number, when I tell you I got the cut of their jib...
[01:55:06.969 --> 01:55:08.850]  I know how to beat these people and so to you.
[01:55:09.270 --> 01:55:28.060]  And the number one thing is getting informed and independent and not submitting to this tyranny and breaking their will and just laughing at him and saying screw you and your control screw your WF screw your new or screw your Satan burn in hell.
[01:55:31.702 --> 01:55:31.942]  All right.
[01:55:34.875 --> 01:55:40.559]  We got Avi Emanet joining us, an incredible reporter on the ground at Davos coming up next second.
[01:55:40.579 --> 01:55:41.460]  But I mentioned this.
[01:55:43.221 --> 01:55:54.749]  What the Democrats do is they have their people support race ward communism and collapse borders and then they'll have their governors or their presidents come out call for unity and say they're against it.
[01:55:54.769 --> 01:55:55.889]  Here's a perfect example.
[01:55:56.270 --> 01:55:58.251]  The American psycho I know behind the scenes.
[01:55:59.552 --> 01:56:02.554]  I'm not at liberty to say is a pathetic coward.
[01:56:04.727 --> 01:56:08.270]  He calls up these big talk show hosts and begs them not to be mean.
[01:56:08.611 --> 01:56:13.415]  One time I was there at dinner just like 3-4 months ago with a major talk show host.
[01:56:13.835 --> 01:56:14.656]  As big as they get.
[01:56:15.597 --> 01:56:17.078]  Not many to choose from is there.
[01:56:18.279 --> 01:56:19.520]  And the son of a bitch called up.
[01:56:20.441 --> 01:56:21.342]  And he's on the phone with him.
[01:56:21.842 --> 01:56:27.568]  And he hangs up and he goes don't tell anybody my name don't say who did this but he was just begging me to be nice to him.
[01:56:27.888 --> 01:56:30.871]  That's how pathetic this maggot is.
[01:56:32.799 --> 01:56:38.229]  I'm talking about American Psycho 2.0, Patrick Batten 2.0, Gavin Newsom.
[01:56:39.872 --> 01:56:45.162]  And Gavin Newsom said, oh well they got the votes in the legislature to ban football.
[01:56:46.209 --> 01:56:47.330]  Because somebody might get hurt.
[01:56:47.851 --> 01:56:50.093]  If you don't get hurt, you'll get hurt way worse.
[01:56:50.934 --> 01:56:52.817]  Best thing I ever did was play football.
[01:56:53.237 --> 01:56:55.380]  Best thing I ever did was get attacked by bullies.
[01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:56.341]  Made me a man.
[01:56:57.061 --> 01:56:57.942]  Yeah, the world's rough.
[01:56:58.243 --> 01:56:59.504]  That's why I want self-driving cars.
[01:56:59.544 --> 01:57:00.245]  Somebody might get hurt.
[01:57:00.525 --> 01:57:02.448]  You're gonna get really hurt if you don't earn your life.
[01:57:04.770 --> 01:57:06.953]  That which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[01:57:08.260 --> 01:57:09.021]  It's totally true.
[01:57:09.741 --> 01:57:24.191]  Anybody telling you they want to take the danger out of your life, and get rid of the slides, and the pool, and you know, get rid of everything fun, because it might hurt you, because they want you a degenerate, weak, domesticated piece of crap.
[01:57:24.852 --> 01:57:27.313]  Newsome blocks attempt by a far left legislator.
[01:57:27.333 --> 01:57:30.596]  Why do you have to veto it then?
[01:57:30.636 --> 01:57:31.276]  It's a majority.
[01:57:31.436 --> 01:57:33.758]  That got the votes to ban youth football.
[01:57:35.484 --> 01:57:37.505]  I'm all against obsessing on NFL.
[01:57:38.345 --> 01:57:40.266]  I'm all for putting your kids in football.
[01:57:41.327 --> 01:57:42.127]  Yeah, they can get hurt.
[01:57:42.627 --> 01:57:45.329]  They can get a hurt a lot worse not getting in the game.
[01:57:48.830 --> 01:57:58.155]  You know I said up here and I yelled scream about the new old order and the globus their plan here in the borders and release a virus and have a global power grab you saw come true.
[01:57:59.295 --> 01:58:00.016]  But there's a
[01:58:01.172 --> 01:58:01.952]  inverse of that.
[01:58:02.693 --> 01:58:05.374]  There's not just the bad stuff I'm telling you about.
[01:58:05.394 --> 01:58:07.675]  There's the good stuff I'm telling you about.
[01:58:08.436 --> 01:58:11.317]  And just like information is the best you're going to find out there.
[01:58:11.838 --> 01:58:13.078]  Our supplements are amazing.
[01:58:13.719 --> 01:58:17.481]  So our new special the last half of January 2024 is here.
[01:58:17.981 --> 01:58:22.343]  It's a real red pill plus and DNA force plus both 50% off.
[01:58:22.503 --> 01:58:25.585]  We're calling it the supercharged special.
[01:58:26.245 --> 01:58:32.070]  You can get either one of these great items at 40% off individually or together for 50% off.
[01:58:32.390 --> 01:58:36.273]  Now the time we have left, I can't tell you why they're so great and what they do for your body.
[01:58:36.694 --> 01:58:41.418]  Go to Infowarsstore.com, look at the ingredients and investigate it and then get them.
[01:58:41.718 --> 01:58:44.220]  It supports the Infowar and it'll change your life.
[01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:46.502]  Take advantage now, Infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:48.317 --> 01:59:10.920]  I'm not on team NFL, I'm not on team NBA, I'm not on team globalist, or wokeism in the new world, I'm on team humanity, that loves God and loves our families and loves humanity and knows that we're destined to do even more incredible things that we've already done together and so inspired by my conversation with Elon Musk recently
[01:59:11.220 --> 01:59:18.225]  Before he agreed with my idea to call it Team Humanity, we've launched two limited edition t-shirts at infowarestore.com.
[01:59:18.505 --> 01:59:22.447]  Let people know that, hey, it isn't about the football games or it isn't even about the UFC.
[01:59:22.948 --> 01:59:27.651]  It's about Team Humanity being under globalist attack, you kid.
[01:59:28.351 --> 01:59:29.171]  We're good to go.
[01:59:29.191 --> 01:59:29.491]  I think?
[01:59:29.511 --> 01:59:29.752]  I think?
[01:59:29.852 --> 01:59:30.192]  I think?
[01:59:30.212 --> 01:59:30.512]  I think?
[02:00:01.527 --> 02:00:29.012]  I don't know what their internal numbers are but as we can pull together the Psychos at Davos 2024 are gleefully celebrating their Victori's genocide of 17 million people from their poison is jab with far more in their sites the un elected so called health experts at Davos 2024 are now prioritized disease X the final solution to solidify new world domination
[02:00:29.292 --> 02:00:30.293]  How did we get here?
[02:00:30.513 --> 02:00:33.135]  It began with utilizing COVID hysteria.
[02:00:33.275 --> 02:00:42.341]  Dr. Fauci blew up the age old regulatory process for testing new vaccines in order to bring in a host of DNA altering technology.
[02:00:42.542 --> 02:00:45.984]  COVID has since been proven to have been created in a lab.
[02:00:46.224 --> 02:00:49.326]  Disease X is lab driven from the outset.
[02:00:49.507 --> 02:00:55.631]  Decades of researching human genes and mice and other animals and the discovery of ancient diseases
[02:00:55.871 --> 02:01:09.416]  Have resulted in the World Economic Forum nonchalantly predicting that disease X with a 100% kill rate could spread across the world in as little as 36 hours killing upwards of 80 million people.
[02:01:09.716 --> 02:01:15.438]  Research has been ongoing at the UK's high security state of the art facility in Porton Down.
[02:01:15.618 --> 02:01:20.080]  We're a threat list grows of animal viruses capable of infecting humans.
[02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:35.067]  Meanwhile, the United States Congress is pushing the bio research bill HR 3832 to further US labs research of disease X. Disease X represents far more than a pandemic of untold mass death.
[02:01:35.147 --> 02:01:40.069]  Disease X allows the pharma billionaires behind it to become trillionaires.
[02:01:40.589 --> 02:01:46.250]  Now, disease X. I've been teaching this sort of thing pretty well full-time since 1990.
[02:01:46.930 --> 02:01:53.151]  And I'd never heard of this disease X. So I looked at some of my books.
[02:01:54.012 --> 02:01:57.292]  Because when I wrote my book, I couldn't remember putting it in.
[02:01:57.492 --> 02:01:58.713]  So it wasn't in there.
[02:01:59.173 --> 02:02:02.093]  So it must be a new disease.
[02:02:02.873 --> 02:02:06.054]  It's a virus we don't know yet, but we do know it's out there.
[02:02:06.849 --> 02:02:22.963]  But the video I was doing yesterday was examining a particular virus that was experimentally used to infect mice, caused a disease of the brain, and at the end of the study, none of the mice, at the end of the study, were alive anymore.
[02:02:23.524 --> 02:02:24.364]  And that virus...
[02:02:25.307 --> 02:02:32.836]  My understanding from reading of the paper was it had been, it evolved in cell cultures in a laboratory.
[02:02:33.336 --> 02:02:40.725]  So as a result of going through cell cultures in a laboratory, the function of the virus had been increased.
[02:02:41.526 --> 02:02:44.029]  So is the next pandemic really preventable?
[02:02:45.583 --> 02:03:07.764]  Funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation supported CEPI to invest 1.2 million in a startup to create under-the-tongue vaccine wafers for needle-free vaccines against Disease X. While simultaneously allowing the World Health Organization's pandemic treaty to reach into sovereign nations and bypass their governments.
[02:03:08.044 --> 02:03:17.528]  A policy-shifting Trojan horse that was rehearsed at the Clade X tabletop exercise by the Johns Hopkins Center in Washington, D.C.
[02:03:17.608 --> 02:03:18.029]  in 2018.
[02:03:18.889 --> 02:03:23.571]  The World Health Organization estimates that 150 million people have died.
[02:03:24.071 --> 02:03:26.973]  That's approximately 2% of the global population.
[02:03:27.313 --> 02:03:33.296]  In the U.S., there have been an estimated 82 million severe cases and 15 million deaths.
[02:03:34.056 --> 02:03:39.279]  At least 5 million Clade X deaths happened because adequate medical care wasn't available.
[02:03:39.719 --> 02:03:42.880]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 90%.
[02:03:43.340 --> 02:03:44.621]  The GDP down 50%.
[02:03:44.921 --> 02:03:50.624]  It was only by nationalizing the healthcare system that basic medical care is still available.
[02:03:51.184 --> 02:03:55.568]  The government now pays for, controls, and rations all medical care.
[02:03:55.708 --> 02:03:57.690]  The President remains in critical condition.
[02:03:58.250 --> 02:04:04.415]  And, while the Vice President is out of intensive care, he remains unable to assume his constitutional duties.
[02:04:04.956 --> 02:04:05.757]  One third of the U.S.
[02:04:05.817 --> 02:04:08.059]  Congress is dead or incapacitated.
[02:04:08.439 --> 02:04:10.421]  What if years go by without a vaccine?
[02:04:11.041 --> 02:04:22.110]  Then, experts tell us that we could eventually see 30 to 40 million deaths in the US, and more than 900 million around the world, 12% of the global population.
[02:04:22.390 --> 02:04:34.260]  As the Expose reported, Playdex is said to have illustrated high level strategic decisions and policies needed to prevent a severe pandemic or diminished consequences should prevention fail.
[02:04:34.620 --> 02:04:35.441]  We're good to go.
[02:04:35.461 --> 02:04:35.861]  I think?
[02:04:35.882 --> 02:04:36.082]  I think?
[02:04:36.102 --> 02:04:36.282]  I think?
[02:04:58.533 --> 02:05:00.795]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[02:05:00.955 --> 02:05:01.315]  Thank you.
[02:05:01.495 --> 02:05:04.077]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[02:05:04.137 --> 02:05:05.398]  I started taking that stuff.
[02:05:05.438 --> 02:05:08.620]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[02:05:08.740 --> 02:05:09.641]  When did you start taking it?
[02:05:09.921 --> 02:05:13.844]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[02:05:14.525 --> 02:05:17.228]  And I started eating a little better, but my blood pressure stayed high.
[02:05:17.248 --> 02:05:24.777]  And when I took X2 iodine, after about three or four weeks, I think my body was detoxified of a bunch of metals and stuff that my body was storing.
[02:05:24.898 --> 02:05:27.100]  And my blood pressure came down to perfect level.
[02:05:27.481 --> 02:05:30.425]  And I tell people the only thing I did was X2 iodine.
[02:05:30.865 --> 02:05:44.732]  And even though I do think all your other products are good, I recommend to anybody that they start with X2 iodine because it detoxifies your body and kind of kicks your natural DNA into full force.
[02:05:44.832 --> 02:05:48.294]  So, in my life, I found X2 iodine the best.
[02:05:48.775 --> 02:05:52.216]  I tried other iodines and they didn't have the same effect.
[02:05:52.516 --> 02:05:54.818]  So, X2 iodine, I really wanted to point that out.
[02:06:06.567 --> 02:06:11.509]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:35.185 --> 02:06:42.472]  Because of God working through us and all of you, all we do is deliver victory, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:07:10.076 --> 02:07:11.617]  X2 is almost sold out, still discounting.
[02:07:12.137 --> 02:07:13.478]  This is the purest iodine there is.

[02:07:37.994 --> 02:07:40.356]  The expensive one's signed.
[02:07:40.376 --> 02:07:42.218]  We're up against the deep state.
[02:07:46.986 --> 02:07:50.369]  So here we are, in the fight, having massive effect.
[02:07:50.830 --> 02:07:52.451]  Will you support Rebel Media?
[02:07:52.631 --> 02:07:53.132]  Rebel News?
[02:07:53.152 --> 02:07:54.393]  Will you support Infowars?
[02:07:56.075 --> 02:07:58.056]  Because we are having victory.
[02:07:58.917 --> 02:08:04.623]  And the globalists are coming to shut off your power, your resources, to create racial division, total war.
[02:08:05.540 --> 02:08:09.281]  But we're fighting against it, and we're so close to defeating this group.
[02:08:09.322 --> 02:08:15.424]  And just like we beat Hitler, or the Soviet Union, it doesn't mean I'm offering some utopia, once we've beaten this group of evil.
[02:08:15.464 --> 02:08:19.906]  But this is the big evil, our generation's evil, coming down on us now.

[02:08:50.683 --> 02:08:52.724]  It's less than one half of one percent that ever buy anything.
[02:08:52.844 --> 02:08:57.706]  And if just one percent would buy the products, we could expand and do incredible things.
[02:08:57.786 --> 02:08:59.847]  I had Ezra Levant, the head of Rebel Media on Air State.
[02:09:00.207 --> 02:09:01.127]  He said, why aren't you here?
[02:09:01.628 --> 02:09:02.268]  Don't have the funds.
[02:09:03.028 --> 02:09:04.149]  Don't have the funds to be at the border.
[02:09:05.369 --> 02:09:06.610]  But that's what it's all about.
[02:09:06.730 --> 02:09:07.610]  Please support us.
[02:09:07.970 --> 02:09:10.732]  Please take action now at infowarestore.com.
[02:09:11.312 --> 02:09:11.592]  All right.
[02:09:13.423 --> 02:09:25.944]  I mean he's a former soldier, reporter, he's a hard guy to get on, he's so busy, he does such a great job exposing tyranny, not just here, but around the world.
[02:09:28.627 --> 02:09:36.309]  Avi Shalom, Yamini is an Australian right-wing political activist, commentator, internet personality from the Australian Jewish Community.
[02:09:37.029 --> 02:09:52.233]  On the 4th of March 2018, Yamini was announced as the member, the Australian Liberty Alliance to run as Victorian Canada for the upper house, he's written for the times of Israel appeared on numerous Australian television shows, including the projects, sunrise and today,
[02:09:53.133 --> 02:09:58.757]  2019 Yemini founded the line of Israel Defense Force IDF training gyms in Melbourne, Victoria.
[02:09:59.158 --> 02:10:09.285]  He's also the founder of J-Safe, a Jewish community group, established in 2016, and responds to the growing number of home invasions of Califed and surrounding areas.
[02:10:09.645 --> 02:10:14.589]  Yemini works independently and creates video content online, wefreports.com.
[02:10:15.009 --> 02:10:40.744]  And I'm so proud to stand with a god loving conservative anti-globous Jew and I'm so proud to stand with him against all the anti-semites that attack us for not wanting to kill all the Jews and he did a great job also exposing the head of the ADL that litter is there to create any some it is to get more money just amazing work but you have been knocking out apart with Ezra Levin another great human another great Jew who are proud to work with
[02:10:41.524 --> 02:10:43.426]  And just incredible work there at Davos.
[02:10:43.507 --> 02:10:44.528]  So many confrontations.
[02:10:44.928 --> 02:10:46.009]  Avi, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:10:48.412 --> 02:10:49.453]  Thanks for having me, mate.
[02:10:50.213 --> 02:10:56.120]  Well, I'm going to try to give you the floor in the next 15-20 minutes to break, because we've got a bunch of clips of your confrontations, but you're right outside Davos.
[02:10:56.140 --> 02:10:56.760]  You've been there.
[02:10:56.780 --> 02:10:58.922]  It's like shooting fish in a barrel.
[02:10:59.223 --> 02:11:00.284]  All the craziness happening.
[02:11:00.504 --> 02:11:01.165]  Where do you want to start?
[02:11:04.585 --> 02:11:05.686]  Um, there's a lot happened.
[02:11:05.706 --> 02:11:08.807]  It's been three, three and a half days already.
[02:11:08.827 --> 02:11:11.248]  So it started on, uh, what day are we already?
[02:11:11.328 --> 02:11:13.609]  I'm, I'm, I've lost track.
[02:11:13.749 --> 02:11:15.890]  We're on Thursday, aren't we?
[02:11:16.230 --> 02:11:16.650]  Thursday.
[02:11:16.670 --> 02:11:21.252]  So we had a full day, Thursday, Wednesday, Tuesday and Monday night.
[02:11:21.712 --> 02:11:28.495]  Um, just tracking down these people that have never faced any real questions from John Kerry.
[02:11:28.515 --> 02:11:29.556]  Let's start with John Kerry.
[02:11:29.576 --> 02:11:30.876]  That's making the rounds.
[02:11:31.456 --> 02:11:32.797]  I can see you bring it up on the screen.
[02:11:34.309 --> 02:11:34.909]  Do you want to apply it?
[02:11:35.470 --> 02:11:38.411]  We will in a moment and we get to all we played Kerry yesterday.
[02:11:38.491 --> 02:12:00.022]  I just want to talk to you about your experience fighting the globalist what you're witnessing and then you also bring it up to the ADL head because you know Jews are like anybody's conservatives liberals you know people don't care but but the whole big picture with all the university heads and the CIA and the media all anti-June now what do you think the larger plan is without
[02:12:03.018 --> 02:12:11.123]  Yeah, it's pretty crazy, and I'll tell you a little secret to just keep it between you and me, Alex, is that you saw the first interaction I had with the ADL.
[02:12:11.704 --> 02:12:13.565]  We've since had another two.
[02:12:14.906 --> 02:12:25.033]  So we've got a very long, and I'll add to that, but as long as you promise to keep it between me and you, is that he even got physical.
[02:12:25.053 --> 02:12:26.294]  He grabbed our cameraman.
[02:12:26.334 --> 02:12:32.838]  He wasn't too happy when I confronted him about exactly what you're saying, and that was my point, is that
[02:12:33.607 --> 02:12:37.208]  He's made anti-Semitism into a business.
[02:12:37.368 --> 02:12:39.428]  Are we saying that anti-Semitism doesn't exist?
[02:12:39.668 --> 02:12:40.869]  Absolutely it exists.
[02:12:40.889 --> 02:12:43.249]  In fact, you can see it now more than ever.
[02:12:44.069 --> 02:12:48.470]  But I actually lay a lot of that blame at the ADL.
[02:12:48.490 --> 02:12:55.912]  I don't think they're the ones... They're not the ones putting the words in people's mouths, but what they've done is
[02:12:56.627 --> 02:12:59.408]  To the Jewish community, a massive disservice over years.
[02:12:59.989 --> 02:13:02.029]  They've alienated all our friends.
[02:13:02.770 --> 02:13:23.579]  Um, you know, a great example is something like when they defamed and, you know, they created these lists of people that they claimed were Islamophobes for warning about, um, ideologies and beliefs and communities and exactly what we're seeing unfold since October 7th.
[02:13:24.617 --> 02:13:49.472]  So they put all these people who were our friends, who were defending us, and some of those, even after being maligned and defamed, character assassinated, and made it impossible to get employed after being labelled by the ADL, even after all that, they're still standing strong because they actually have a moral compass and they actually stand for what is right, even when it's difficult.
[02:13:51.194 --> 02:13:53.235]  But what it proved is they were right the whole time,
[02:13:53.896 --> 02:14:06.117]  And the ADL who pretended to fight anti-Semitism, and they do fight anti-Semitism, but they're not fighting it to fight anti-Semitism, they're fighting it because it's a business for them.
[02:14:06.861 --> 02:14:17.528]  And the thing, the sad fact is that now after October 7th, there is that massive spike in antisemitism and nobody really wants to hear that.
[02:14:18.008 --> 02:14:21.410]  In fact, I've always hated, you know, they made me hate the word.
[02:14:22.451 --> 02:14:30.796]  So I can only imagine somebody that's not personal, somebody that doesn't feel it, somebody that's... And we're going to show that green black clip in a moment, our computer crashed, but it's coming back up.
[02:14:31.156 --> 02:14:32.537]  But the reason I raise that is...
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:37.522]  I sit there and watch every university head attacking Israel.
[02:14:38.123 --> 02:14:41.645]  All the CIA deputy director, and I'm not saying Israel is perfect.
[02:14:41.805 --> 02:14:43.045]  All these governments have got big problems.
[02:14:43.065 --> 02:14:44.146]  Absolutely not.
[02:14:45.027 --> 02:14:46.848]  Alex, I love Israel.
[02:14:47.328 --> 02:14:49.649]  I criticize the government, especially in COVID.
[02:14:50.150 --> 02:14:51.230]  They were outrageous.
[02:14:52.311 --> 02:14:53.371]  I love Australia.
[02:14:53.792 --> 02:14:55.993]  I criticize the government just as much.
[02:14:56.553 --> 02:14:59.795]  You can legitimately criticize policies of a government.
[02:14:59.915 --> 02:15:00.495]  No, I agree.
[02:15:00.516 --> 02:15:02.437]  So let me ask you a big question, because you're a smart guy and I respect you.
[02:15:03.602 --> 02:15:10.266]  It's super in vogue, viral everywhere to say Jews run everything under the devil, and the very same liberal media is running that.
[02:15:10.326 --> 02:15:11.727]  What do you think the big picture is?
[02:15:12.047 --> 02:15:12.888]  Why are they doing that?
[02:15:12.908 --> 02:15:14.529]  Because it's outrageous.
[02:15:16.482 --> 02:15:19.623]  Look, I think there's different forces at play here.
[02:15:19.683 --> 02:15:23.145]  You've got everyone for their own, their own reasons.
[02:15:23.205 --> 02:15:27.726]  I think if you've got your far left, then you've got your, you know, the extreme fringe right.
[02:15:27.906 --> 02:15:31.828]  And then you've got, which has kind of grown sadly over the last few months.
[02:15:31.948 --> 02:15:33.588]  And then you've got obviously your Islamists.
[02:15:33.688 --> 02:15:37.850]  What you've got to remember is Jews make up what, 12, 14, I don't even know the numbers.
[02:15:37.910 --> 02:15:39.711]  It's tiny in the comparison.
[02:15:40.431 --> 02:15:42.772]  12 million in the world, 14 million somewhere along there.
[02:15:43.292 --> 02:15:49.138]  In the world, there's probably 70 religions in India that have more people than Jews.
[02:15:50.840 --> 02:16:05.975]  So I think what's happened since October 7, you've seen this kind of unholy alliance between, you know, that fringe right, fringe left, and a big part of the Muslim world.
[02:16:06.684 --> 02:16:09.245]  And they're all saying the same thing, kind of much.
[02:16:09.305 --> 02:16:12.147]  It's a very bizarre situation we're in.
[02:16:12.607 --> 02:16:14.588]  And it's sad.
[02:16:15.509 --> 02:16:19.911]  But... Why do you think the head of the ADL is at Davos?
[02:16:21.772 --> 02:16:26.014]  Why do I think the head of the ADL is at Davos?
[02:16:26.294 --> 02:16:27.535]  Probably not just one reason.
[02:16:27.595 --> 02:16:31.737]  I think looking for funding, looking for connections.
[02:16:34.190 --> 02:16:35.831]  Make some orders, give some orders.
[02:16:35.851 --> 02:16:37.813]  I don't know Alex.
[02:16:37.873 --> 02:16:44.897]  I tried to get to the bottom of it, but he got super defensive and tried to somehow turn it on me.
[02:16:44.937 --> 02:16:54.424]  And what I found interesting is one of his points that you'll see in the later videos is that, you know, I made the point to him that you've always targeted
[02:16:56.066 --> 02:17:01.230]  The right wing, the conservatives, anybody that basically didn't share your world view.
[02:17:01.691 --> 02:17:06.475]  You labelled them a racist, an Islamophobe, an anti-Semite, whatever.
[02:17:07.416 --> 02:17:13.521]  And the problem is now, we fast forward to now, and that's turned against us.
[02:17:13.581 --> 02:17:21.328]  And his defence was, well, haven't you seen that I actually have criticised the left, but I only criticise the left when it comes to Israel.
[02:17:21.815 --> 02:17:34.022]  Which is the massive, the biggest disservice to us because it only proves our detractors point is that all he cares about is Jews and all that matters is Jews when it doesn't.
[02:17:34.503 --> 02:17:41.267]  In fact, anti-Semitism was always wrong and was always wrong from the left or the right prior to October 7th.
[02:17:42.170 --> 02:17:49.474]  Just some of us are brave enough to always call it out, and I'm not talking about just Jews, I'm talking about, you know, my good friend Tommy Robinson.
[02:17:49.534 --> 02:18:01.521]  I've seen him over the years, always standing up against, you know, I'm talking about the early days when one of his assault charges was literally hitting a Nazi that wouldn't leave his protest.
[02:18:02.316 --> 02:18:11.101]  And these are the people that got absolutely character assassinated by this ADL that pretended to fight for our community.
[02:18:11.201 --> 02:18:23.769]  And you talk about people that are just pro-peace and not anti-Israel, and by extension pro, going after Trump saying he's an anti-Semite ADL, going after me, preposterous, going after Elon Musk.
[02:18:24.649 --> 02:18:30.591]  I mean, literally, they don't spend any of their time on real people that literally say, kill all the Jews.
[02:18:30.751 --> 02:18:33.252]  He denies he really went after Elon Musk.
[02:18:33.372 --> 02:18:34.913]  I challenged him on Elon Musk.
[02:18:34.953 --> 02:18:35.213]  You did?
[02:18:35.233 --> 02:18:37.113]  I didn't get a chance to challenge him about you.
[02:18:37.433 --> 02:18:38.734]  But Elon, he denies it.
[02:18:38.814 --> 02:18:39.614]  He rewrites history.
[02:18:39.634 --> 02:18:44.816]  But this is the same guy that you will see in the video that we're keeping between us for now.
[02:18:45.136 --> 02:18:46.496]  Yeah, tell us, when is that coming out?
[02:18:46.516 --> 02:18:47.077]  When did this happen?
[02:18:48.911 --> 02:18:56.716]  It just happened but it's because there was two interactions and we've got so much, so many videos and so many interactions.
[02:18:56.736 --> 02:18:57.876]  You don't have to tell me about it.
[02:18:57.917 --> 02:19:01.939]  You work all day, you work all day and you've got five hours of footage and you've got a... I get it.
[02:19:02.279 --> 02:19:03.220]  But it's coming out soon.
[02:19:03.959 --> 02:19:04.179]  Yeah.
[02:19:04.879 --> 02:19:12.421]  It's coming out soon and I want to get it out right because I think I want to explain to the audience what they're actually seeing.
[02:19:12.521 --> 02:19:19.103]  But to my point, he grabs the camera and then a second later he denies he grabbed it even though we've got three cameras on it.
[02:19:19.123 --> 02:19:23.104]  This is the guy who wants to define what is true and not.
[02:19:24.125 --> 02:19:25.945]  So yeah, that's where we're at.
[02:19:25.965 --> 02:19:28.926]  We've had a really good time here exposing these people.
[02:19:30.453 --> 02:19:57.583]  Since you bring it up, I want to play this one first, because I told listeners this last few years, I said look, the ADL and Sarsberg Cohen, literally saying Trump's Hitler and all this, obviously people love Trump, and they know that's not true, so let's give them this credit, and the ADL saying we represent Jews, well I would hate any group up there, there was some weird group saying I represent Christians, and then they're saying by the way, we don't like all these other groups, they're clearly trying to start a fight,
[02:19:58.263 --> 02:20:00.989]  To create pressure and then they get more donations.
[02:20:01.009 --> 02:20:03.894]  I mean, do you think that's kind of the baseline of what's happening here?
[02:20:04.904 --> 02:20:06.205]  It is his business.
[02:20:06.505 --> 02:20:07.445]  It is his business.
[02:20:07.485 --> 02:20:16.388]  You know, sometimes there are people within my community, sadly, that have monetized anti-Semitism.
[02:20:16.568 --> 02:20:31.054]  And it's scary because, you know, they wake up every morning and if there isn't an anti-Semitic incident, they find something that's like, you know, I feel like they go around, back in Australia at least, I feel like they were going around
[02:20:31.574 --> 02:20:57.668]  Spring Swastik is at one point because there was just nothing and I want to show but it's worse than that aren't they mainly left us though getting money to do it so they're just absolutely yeah so they're loved this demonizing opposition is Nazis and then meanwhile ally with Hezbo and Hamas and saying these giant violent protest attack the White House are good I mean I tell I tell conservatives as I say they're getting roped into this anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-anti-a-
[02:20:57.828 --> 02:20:58.188]  I think?
[02:20:58.249 --> 02:20:58.849]  I think?
[02:20:59.350 --> 02:20:59.890]  I think?
[02:21:00.150 --> 02:21:00.531]  I think?
[02:21:24.439 --> 02:21:25.739]  It is wild.
[02:21:25.980 --> 02:21:27.020]  And it's not only the left.
[02:21:27.341 --> 02:21:28.742]  You look on the right as well.
[02:21:28.782 --> 02:21:48.875]  You look at... I know your friends and you look at Andrew Tate and you look at that whole new group that have kind of... I don't think they know the first thing about what they've joined but they've joined it and now they're suddenly experts in the Middle East and they don't understand that really it's a war on our entire
[02:21:50.737 --> 02:21:52.441]  Free and democratic way of life.
[02:21:52.502 --> 02:21:53.183]  That's the thing.
[02:21:53.324 --> 02:21:58.837]  If Israel falls, what people need to understand is, if Israel falls, America's next.
[02:21:59.702 --> 02:22:03.786]  Israel is the front line of that war of ideas.
[02:22:03.886 --> 02:22:04.767]  But let's go further.
[02:22:05.348 --> 02:22:07.530]  Israel has hundreds of nuclear weapons conservatively.
[02:22:07.630 --> 02:22:08.591]  Israel's not gonna fall.
[02:22:09.072 --> 02:22:11.995]  So all these people saying to the mountain of the sea.
[02:22:12.595 --> 02:22:13.837]  It's a pipe dream.
[02:22:14.117 --> 02:22:14.878]  It's a delusion.
[02:22:14.998 --> 02:22:15.638]  And it becomes this.
[02:22:15.999 --> 02:22:17.080]  I cover any other issue.
[02:22:17.140 --> 02:22:17.821]  Russia, China.
[02:22:17.861 --> 02:22:18.942]  Why are you attacking Jews?
[02:22:19.282 --> 02:22:22.045]  It's a mental illness to just own focus on Israel.
[02:22:22.065 --> 02:22:22.846]  I'll be quite frank with you.
[02:22:24.318 --> 02:22:53.196]  No, I agree with you, and today I bumped into the head of the Human Rights Watch, and I put the question to him, why is there a disproportionate, because from both sides, from everywhere, there is this obsession with Israel, when you look at the numbers, it should be insignificant, when you look at Yemen, and some of the other wars, Syria, the conflict in Israel between Israel and Hamas, should be insignificant, but somehow,
[02:22:54.153 --> 02:23:00.739]  Everybody, even people who don't have political opinions about anything else, suddenly are experts.
[02:23:13.823 --> 02:23:17.184]  All we're hearing from Harvard and the corporate press is Israel's bad.
[02:23:17.524 --> 02:23:20.105]  The establishment is attacking Israel, folks.
[02:23:20.465 --> 02:23:22.066]  That, to me, is a no-brainer.
[02:23:22.086 --> 02:23:23.106]  There's a set-up here.
[02:23:23.126 --> 02:23:24.586]  A, do you agree with me?
[02:23:24.626 --> 02:23:25.467]  B, what is the set-up?
[02:23:27.747 --> 02:23:29.068]  I absolutely agree with you.
[02:23:29.108 --> 02:23:29.948]  And what's the set-up?
[02:23:30.629 --> 02:23:41.632]  Again, I think it's just different opportunists that have joined together for a common purpose, and the purpose is to destroy Israel for their own specific interests.
[02:23:41.812 --> 02:23:43.012]  And it's not going to work.
[02:23:43.252 --> 02:23:44.533]  And they want that conflict.
[02:23:44.573 --> 02:23:46.173]  You know, some people just want World War III.
[02:23:46.673 --> 02:23:47.253]  That's the thing.
[02:23:47.714 --> 02:23:48.654]  And that's where it could lead.
[02:23:48.674 --> 02:23:50.554]  By the way, Israel gets attacked.
[02:23:50.694 --> 02:23:52.355]  Israel gets attacked with the Samson option.
[02:23:52.975 --> 02:23:55.697]  But it's following the US thing of mutually assured destruction.
[02:23:56.077 --> 02:23:58.239]  If you nuke us or destroy us, we destroy you.
[02:23:58.659 --> 02:24:04.964]  So again, everybody that hates Israel for the Samson option, they learned it from the United States with mutually assured destruction.
[02:24:05.224 --> 02:24:07.145]  So let's explain to all the anti-Israel people.
[02:24:07.426 --> 02:24:08.927]  You don't get to do that.
[02:24:09.227 --> 02:24:10.208]  That's nuclear war.
[02:24:13.090 --> 02:24:13.490]  Agreed.
[02:24:13.550 --> 02:24:14.531]  And look, I think...
[02:24:15.442 --> 02:24:20.704]  If people are genuinely sympathetic to the Palestinian people, I'm with you.
[02:24:21.184 --> 02:24:36.370]  And what you've got to understand is I think the majority of Israelis, the vast majority of Israelis and Jews around the world, left and right, prior to October 7th, were very, very sympathetic to the Palestinian people.
[02:24:37.051 --> 02:24:44.556]  The problem is when you are governed on the leaders, you know, you chose a government that was in there.
[02:24:44.636 --> 02:24:47.258]  Well, I love how Amasis leaders don't live in the country.
[02:24:47.599 --> 02:24:49.320]  Don't live in the country.
[02:24:49.840 --> 02:24:53.663]  They're in Qatar and we're seeing a bunch of the Qataris here in the WEF.
[02:24:54.203 --> 02:25:01.909]  And that was another thing that stood out to me in the WEF and it goes to your point, Alex, is that in the last three, I've attended the last three, um,
[02:25:02.828 --> 02:25:03.668]  We're good to go.
[02:25:31.224 --> 02:25:34.445]  And it's kind of this thing like you 100% have to support Ukraine.
[02:25:35.226 --> 02:25:55.053]  This year, after the attack on Israel, on Israeli civilians and Israel's retaliation, suddenly most of the talks in the WEF, they had the Israeli president today trying to defend himself, but most of the talks that you've seen around the conflict have been anti-Israel, have been pro-Palestinian, have been...
[02:25:56.747 --> 02:26:03.256]  What I don't understand is, so when the conflict broke out in Ukraine, the WEF
[02:26:04.591 --> 02:26:11.075]  Which is it goes to what you were saying before the establishment just supported the Ukrainian cause to a fault.
[02:26:11.175 --> 02:26:14.297]  Yeah, nobody can get around the establishment.
[02:26:14.538 --> 02:26:17.359]  Nobody can get around the establishment support of Ukraine.
[02:26:17.399 --> 02:26:18.220]  I'm not a Russophile.
[02:26:18.260 --> 02:26:19.241]  I'm not with Russia.
[02:26:19.581 --> 02:26:22.763]  But when I 100% is pro-Russia now it's 100% anti-Israel.
[02:26:23.103 --> 02:26:23.503]  Come on.
[02:26:23.724 --> 02:26:25.645]  I mean like there's something's going on here.
[02:26:25.985 --> 02:26:27.126]  That's all I'm telling people like.
[02:26:28.147 --> 02:26:33.591]  All the universities, the corporate media, it's all against Israel, it's all against Russia, what does that tell you?
[02:26:33.892 --> 02:26:35.053]  There's a larger plan here.
[02:26:37.395 --> 02:26:53.909]  And I knew it was going to happen on October 7th, so as I watched in horror, like most of the world, I knew that we, I knew we had a really short win, and I spoke to Ezra as you know, Ezra's the head of Rebel News, and I remember on the day speaking to him and saying,
[02:26:55.217 --> 02:27:10.982]  I think we have a window of two to three days where nobody in the world can look at the images we're seeing and not be sympathetic to the civilians that are being butchered, raped, you know, the horrific scenes that we saw.
[02:27:11.342 --> 02:27:11.642]  Nobody.
[02:27:11.842 --> 02:27:18.204]  So I knew we had a short window and I said, but after that window closes with Israel, it's going to be a really short window.
[02:27:18.824 --> 02:27:30.630]  After that window closes, the establishment is going to go into overdrive, and the narrative is going to shift to Israel being the aggressor here in this situation.
[02:27:30.790 --> 02:27:41.556]  And as soon as they start defending themselves, because everybody loves, you know, everybody's okay with, everybody's sympathetic to dying Jews, but they don't support the Jews fighting back.
[02:27:41.576 --> 02:27:43.437]  You saw that in World War II, same thing.
[02:27:44.558 --> 02:27:46.719]  You know, everybody's sympathetic after the fact.
[02:27:47.439 --> 02:27:58.507]  And the establishment, they are only, so Jews, the Jewish state can only be losing and we're sad for them, or they're the oppressors.
[02:27:58.907 --> 02:28:02.569]  And we need to, we need to wipe these colonizers off the map.
[02:28:02.609 --> 02:28:08.473]  Well, it's just like Obama back to Arab, it's just like Obama back to Arab Spring to overthrow pro-Western governments.
[02:28:08.493 --> 02:28:15.118]  There's a larger plan with Davos and Globos working with Islam, because it is the biggest group in the world to take over.
[02:28:15.658 --> 02:28:17.720]  I want to come back with the ADL confrontation.
[02:28:17.740 --> 02:28:18.521]  Can't wait to see the new ones.
[02:28:18.541 --> 02:28:25.468]  I want to shift gears out of that RV into what you're seeing at Davos, where you think Trump's going, the awakening, all these other issues.
[02:28:25.488 --> 02:28:31.874]  But absolutely, the establishment is pro-Palestine, pro-Muslim, and
[02:28:32.595 --> 02:28:40.819]  And then they're bringing them all over here, you got Hezbollah and Hamas, and they got the borders wide open, there's a bigger plan here, and anybody not telling you that is an idiot.
[02:28:41.359 --> 02:28:50.763]  Alright, you can find it all on Rebel News, ladies and gentlemen, you can find it all on their Twitter account, they also have the WFReports.com, stay with us, we'll be right back.

[02:29:38.560 --> 02:29:41.342]  I know there's millions of forms of media out there and all this BS.
[02:29:41.562 --> 02:29:43.363]  And the globalists hope you get lost in all of it.
[02:29:43.723 --> 02:29:48.406]  But notice the globalists, the New World Order, are coming after us because they realize we've got their numbers.
[02:29:49.266 --> 02:29:49.707]  Think about it.

[02:30:57.808 --> 02:30:59.590]  Real death is shutting off the economy.
[02:30:59.790 --> 02:31:02.092]  The bureaucrats and the corporations control economy.
[02:31:02.413 --> 02:31:04.575]  As they vertically economy consolidate power.
[02:31:04.815 --> 02:31:05.916]  They murder people in mass.
[02:31:06.537 --> 02:31:07.578]  Anyone must is warned them.
[02:31:07.918 --> 02:31:09.580]  That if you destroy civilization.
[02:31:10.080 --> 02:31:14.545]  You will have certain redouts of certain city states still have the hunger games model.
[02:31:14.865 --> 02:31:16.166]  It will destroy the elite as well.
[02:31:16.427 --> 02:31:19.209]  Anybody that studies history and as common sense knows that.
[02:31:19.870 --> 02:31:41.209]  The wars are gonna come out the starvation and inflation are being blamed on global warming the viruses that come out the labs are being blamed on global warming the third world hoards being organized by the UN invade are being blamed on global warming the mass starvations blame on the virus and everywhere told it's gonna get worse bills are coming Al Gore and Clinton and Hillary Clinton
[02:31:42.116 --> 02:31:52.708]  And the Rothschilds and the Deimos Group and Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and Yvonne Harari say billions are coming to Europe, a billion are coming to the US because of climate change.
[02:31:53.228 --> 02:31:57.653]  No, because you cut their economy off because the IMF and World Bank controls the loans and ordered lockdowns.

[02:32:39.887 --> 02:32:40.067]  I think?
[02:32:40.147 --> 02:32:40.407]  I think?
[02:32:40.427 --> 02:32:40.627]  I think?
[02:32:40.647 --> 02:32:40.907]  I think?
[02:32:40.927 --> 02:32:41.367]  I think?
[02:32:41.867 --> 02:32:42.107]  I think?
[02:32:42.127 --> 02:32:42.307]  I think?
[02:33:09.400 --> 02:33:14.407]  From the front line of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[02:33:36.532 --> 02:34:02.537]  I want to move out of the whole Israel to get back to WF but look anybody that's really looking at reality will understand the establishment is being anti-Israel right now and Israel's purpose governments are but what's going on here the left sees giant third world populations and two billion Muslims and they have a clarity plan for Europe or us that they say we're allied with that
[02:34:03.300 --> 02:34:08.443]  So there's big powerful interests that want to use the third world against the first world.
[02:34:09.263 --> 02:34:14.146]  And as Avi said earlier, if Israel goes down, the US is the next target.
[02:34:14.406 --> 02:34:19.589]  And I see all these right wingers allied with orthodox expansionary Islam right now.
[02:34:20.090 --> 02:34:21.951]  And it's disgusting and it's insane.
[02:34:22.211 --> 02:34:23.652]  And they don't want to have a discussion about that.
[02:34:24.492 --> 02:34:39.070]  They see themselves promoting corporate media, they see themselves doing all this, and they think, oh my god, the world's going to be fixed, you know, we're going to finally get rid of the Jews, and it's just bizarre, and there's this larger evil force behind it, manipulating it.
[02:34:39.150 --> 02:34:39.991]  Avi, do you agree with that?
[02:34:40.011 --> 02:34:40.932]  You want to comment to that?
[02:34:44.219 --> 02:34:45.000]  100% mate.
[02:34:45.320 --> 02:34:47.421]  You've articulated it perfectly.
[02:34:47.881 --> 02:34:49.482]  I'm following it.
[02:34:49.582 --> 02:34:50.563]  And you know what?
[02:34:50.583 --> 02:34:53.445]  I'm grateful to hear somebody making sense on this issue finally.
[02:34:53.945 --> 02:35:01.470]  Because it's been since October 7 watching some of the people that I did have a lot of respect for suddenly lose their minds as well.
[02:35:01.670 --> 02:35:05.212]  And for me, how that's happening is the bigger question.
[02:35:06.715 --> 02:35:11.162]  Well, since we mentioned it earlier, let's play the clip, and you've got new ones coming out, can't wait to see them.
[02:35:11.562 --> 02:35:14.487]  Of the head of the EEO, you politely talk to him, and he's so arrogant.
[02:35:14.787 --> 02:35:17.111]  He doesn't know what the boy cried wolf story is.
[02:35:17.451 --> 02:35:19.154]  No, that's a classic global response.
[02:35:19.194 --> 02:35:20.456]  He won't treat you like a human.
[02:35:20.916 --> 02:35:22.038]  He won't even respond to you.
[02:35:22.078 --> 02:35:22.398]  Here it is.
[02:35:23.567 --> 02:35:24.447]  How you doing, Jonathan?
[02:35:24.467 --> 02:35:25.188]  I'm good.
[02:35:25.288 --> 02:35:26.348]  Can I ask you something?
[02:35:26.368 --> 02:35:27.128]  I'm meeting somebody, I'm sorry.
[02:35:27.228 --> 02:35:27.888]  I'll walk with you.
[02:35:28.008 --> 02:35:30.489]  Are you, are you like that, the boy who cried wolf?
[02:35:30.869 --> 02:35:31.089]  Are you?
[02:35:31.109 --> 02:35:40.653]  For so many years you, you, you cried anti-Semitism and you found hatred everywhere and then, and then, and then finally, and then, I'll be meeting you from Rebel News.
[02:35:40.693 --> 02:35:41.393]  What's Rebel News?
[02:35:41.433 --> 02:35:42.033]  Rebel News.
[02:35:42.713 --> 02:35:51.296]  It doesn't matter, but finally now that when the world, when the world has turned so anti-Semitic, no one believes us because of people like you and the work that you do.
[02:35:52.361 --> 02:35:56.383]  Destroying our allies, making lists about our allies, people that actually defend us.
[02:35:57.143 --> 02:35:59.324]  You've been a big part of that problem, haven't you?
[02:35:59.344 --> 02:36:03.066]  Do you know the boy that cried wolf?
[02:36:03.406 --> 02:36:04.487]  I'm not familiar with this story.
[02:36:04.527 --> 02:36:05.887]  Why don't you explain it to me?
[02:36:05.927 --> 02:36:12.791]  Jonathan, like it's not a joke because the Jews around the world, we are feeling the pain and you've alienated so many of our allies.
[02:36:13.151 --> 02:36:14.111]  What about Elon Musk?
[02:36:14.471 --> 02:36:15.552]  Somebody that's been so good?
[02:36:16.252 --> 02:36:17.293]  No, you got a message for Elon?
[02:36:18.973 --> 02:36:19.634]  Thank you, Jonathan.
[02:36:20.404 --> 02:36:20.785]  There you go.
[02:36:21.407 --> 02:36:22.028]  Nothing to say.
[02:36:22.991 --> 02:36:24.134]  Censorship in real life.
[02:36:24.154 --> 02:36:26.561]  I bet you I'm going to be on a list tomorrow.
[02:36:27.779 --> 02:36:32.422]  Jonathan Grimblatt is a man that has cried anti-Semitism for years.
[02:36:32.602 --> 02:36:33.663]  He has found hate.
[02:36:33.683 --> 02:36:39.606]  He's made it his job to find hate and anti-Semitism and Jew hatred where it hasn't been.
[02:36:40.366 --> 02:36:55.976]  Now, the problem with that is fast forward to October 7th where many of us Jews are finally seeing real anti-Semitism but so much of the world is numb to it and don't believe it because he's cried it for so many years.
[02:36:56.516 --> 02:37:09.341]  The Jonathan Grimblats of the world who label anyone with an opposing view as a racist and as anti-Semite and now suddenly in our darkest days we have no one left to support us.
[02:37:09.801 --> 02:37:10.701]  That is why we're here.
[02:37:11.142 --> 02:37:12.602]  WFReports.com.
[02:37:12.922 --> 02:37:14.663]  Bookmark and support our work.
[02:37:17.495 --> 02:37:18.595]  So I mean, that's really it.
[02:37:18.655 --> 02:37:19.316]  It's real simple.
[02:37:19.376 --> 02:37:20.276]  Big corporations.
[02:37:20.316 --> 02:37:20.876]  Black rock.
[02:37:21.196 --> 02:37:30.340]  They just go hire a so called Jewish organization to then demonize Eon Musk and Alex Jones and Donald Trump who's like Trump's super friend of Israel.
[02:37:30.460 --> 02:37:35.342]  It just it's insane but it's a powerful political attack.
[02:37:35.422 --> 02:37:37.823]  How do we counter that and then shift gears and other topics?
[02:37:40.416 --> 02:37:59.272]  I just keep... Look, I think the truth comes out at the end, and I think if we keep speaking the truth, then people argue with, you know, who... It's more important for people like you to speak out about it and to point to the truth than people like me, because people like me feel like maybe he's just a Jew.
[02:37:59.472 --> 02:38:01.594]  It's a bit like the Grimblats of this world.
[02:38:01.994 --> 02:38:03.215]  So I appreciate it, Alex.
[02:38:03.295 --> 02:38:09.120]  It's good on you for standing up for what's right, even in such a time where it's become so unpopular.
[02:38:09.793 --> 02:38:14.215]  Well, Avi, it's clearly a globalist operation against us all, so I'm standing up for everybody.
[02:38:14.555 --> 02:38:18.918]  I mean, I care about Jews and everybody else, but I mean, when the whole establishment's behind something, I'm against it.
[02:38:18.978 --> 02:38:20.639]  I mean, that's not rocket science.
[02:38:20.699 --> 02:38:24.521]  And I'm watching this happen, and it's really concerning.
[02:38:24.901 --> 02:38:25.981]  You confronted a lot of other people.
[02:38:26.041 --> 02:38:27.722]  I'll come back on when we have the full length.
[02:38:31.324 --> 02:38:36.407]  I can promise you now, I think you'll enjoy that one a lot more than the short film.
[02:38:45.231 --> 02:39:12.647]  So I caught him, so basically the promenade here is about, I don't know, a kilometre, and maybe even more, and I caught him at the end of it, so right outside Black Rock, which is at the bottom end of the promenade, and I basically said to him, listen, you have a chance to finally apologise to the Jewish community, I didn't give you the chance here today, and he ignored me for about a minute, and then he snapped, and it became, it was on.
[02:39:13.619 --> 02:39:19.403]  Um, and, and, you know, he tried to, he tried to defend himself and, and crashed me out a little bit, and you'll get to see it.
[02:39:20.164 --> 02:39:24.527]  And I think it's very telling, um, the, the, the, the video coming up.
[02:39:24.567 --> 02:39:29.750]  But I, I promise once we release it, I'll, I'll send it to you and, and, um, and I'll come back on it and we can discuss it.
[02:39:29.770 --> 02:39:30.351]  Well, please do.
[02:39:30.371 --> 02:39:33.553]  You've got a few days left of this, and I'm glad we covered this because...
[02:39:34.506 --> 02:39:39.212]  Uh, like you said, when the whole media supports Ukraine, I'm not even for Russia, I'm just like, what's going on?
[02:39:39.512 --> 02:39:44.358]  The whole media is anti-Israel, and then everybody's like, acting like they're anti-establishment, being anti-Israel.
[02:39:45.018 --> 02:39:46.921]  Plus, it's not going anywhere, Israel is doing well.
[02:39:46.941 --> 02:39:48.002]  Most insane!
[02:39:48.723 --> 02:39:50.244]  Most insane part!
[02:39:50.325 --> 02:39:53.688]  Everybody that's anti-establishment is just doing the establishment.
[02:39:55.117 --> 02:39:55.777]  We're good to go.
[02:39:55.797 --> 02:39:56.078]  I think?
[02:39:56.138 --> 02:39:56.398]  I think?
[02:39:56.418 --> 02:39:56.558]  I think?
[02:39:56.578 --> 02:39:56.738]  I think?
[02:40:18.090 --> 02:40:18.730]  I think?
[02:40:18.750 --> 02:40:19.271]  I think?
[02:40:19.311 --> 02:40:19.571]  I think?
[02:40:19.591 --> 02:40:19.771]  I think?
[02:40:45.058 --> 02:40:45.479]  That was great.
[02:40:45.519 --> 02:40:49.822]  No, I was going to say we're going to be put on an ADL list again if we talk about the Jews for too much longer.
[02:40:50.383 --> 02:40:50.883]  That's right.
[02:40:52.144 --> 02:40:56.448]  So, Ami, what about your talk with Richard Quest?
[02:40:59.531 --> 02:41:05.536]  It was, you know what, it was fun because you just watch him.
[02:41:05.617 --> 02:41:09.160]  He's certainly a character and
[02:41:10.054 --> 02:41:29.583]  He tried to, he tried to argue that he, you know, when we made the point, well, especially Ezra, Ezra was on fire on this one, making the point that how can you be, how can you be here as a critical, you know, the report on the WDF, which is the point that we've been trying to make over the last few years.
[02:41:29.603 --> 02:41:32.485]  You've got all the corporate media here, but they're not here.
[02:41:33.208 --> 02:41:40.753]  Who hold them accountable or ask, you know, the tough questions or even the simple questions that the average person has around the world.
[02:41:41.093 --> 02:41:46.257]  They're here to be part of the event and they spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to be a part of it.
[02:41:47.017 --> 02:41:50.559]  And they get at which gives them access and they don't want to lose that access.
[02:41:50.660 --> 02:41:54.722]  And we basically put that to him in the walk line and tried to get away and couldn't get away.
[02:41:54.822 --> 02:41:58.625]  And, um, and I think he essentially admits to
[02:41:59.955 --> 02:42:29.407]  To the fact that you know yeah he said he argued that he didn't buy the access they buy everything else and the access comes the bonus which I don't know if it's any different well the bottom line is people say identify the ruling elite Black Rock State Street and a few others probably 80% of things so this is who runs things you're there actually confronted early class here's a minion paying me there trying back like he's you know the fair but but but but it is this from
[02:42:32.714 --> 02:42:34.935]  Absolutely, yep.
[02:42:34.995 --> 02:42:37.536]  Our computers are crashing so much that it drives me crazy.
[02:42:37.936 --> 02:42:40.498]  Can we play the clip, guys, of a CNN anchor request?
[02:42:40.858 --> 02:42:42.179]  Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.
[02:42:42.259 --> 02:42:42.879]  Pleasant.
[02:42:43.899 --> 02:42:50.282]  Half past nine in the morning to be ambushed by one, two, three, four, five people.
[02:42:50.923 --> 02:42:51.203]  Five!
[02:42:51.583 --> 02:42:54.985]  I don't even deploy that many people when I'm going to interview a president.
[02:42:55.005 --> 02:42:57.366]  You've got that many people in the makeup room alone!
[02:43:01.894 --> 02:43:03.235]  I'd recognize that voice anywhere.
[02:43:03.275 --> 02:43:03.755]  How you doing?
[02:43:03.935 --> 02:43:04.216]  I'm sorry.
[02:43:04.236 --> 02:43:04.856]  Not this morning.
[02:43:04.876 --> 02:43:05.617]  What are you sorry about?
[02:43:05.897 --> 02:43:07.578]  Well, I'm sorry that I can't stop to talk to you.
[02:43:07.698 --> 02:43:08.238]  Let's not stop.
[02:43:08.258 --> 02:43:08.979]  Let's talk and walk.
[02:43:09.019 --> 02:43:10.240]  We got 60 seconds.
[02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:11.601]  I gotta have one question for you.
[02:43:11.821 --> 02:43:14.543]  I've been thinking about CNN and yourself especially.
[02:43:14.563 --> 02:43:15.403]  A lot of credibility.
[02:43:15.423 --> 02:43:16.324]  A lot of reputation.
[02:43:16.884 --> 02:43:21.007]  But how can you ask critical questions here if you're paying to be here?
[02:43:21.407 --> 02:43:22.808]  Like CNN pays to be here.
[02:43:22.848 --> 02:43:25.070]  So how can you critically ask questions about the WEF?
[02:43:25.470 --> 02:43:35.437]  I always find it's best to be very careful when walking, talking, and doing interviews, particularly in snowy conditions, because I think... Now you're avoiding the question.
[02:43:35.477 --> 02:43:36.678]  I think it's because you're embarrassed.
[02:43:37.359 --> 02:43:42.602]  I think it's always very important to understand... Now we have two against one.
[02:43:43.243 --> 02:43:44.224]  I'm not against you, mate.
[02:43:44.264 --> 02:43:45.665]  We're all on the side of the truth.
[02:43:45.705 --> 02:43:46.285]  At least I am.
[02:43:46.325 --> 02:43:47.066]  I know you are too.
[02:43:47.086 --> 02:43:48.407]  Now let me ask you, do you ski?
[02:43:49.289 --> 02:43:50.210]  I have a better question.
[02:43:50.290 --> 02:43:51.592]  It's more in the public interest.
[02:43:51.952 --> 02:43:58.979]  How can CNN report neutrally or objectively on the World Economic Forum if you're paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to be here?
[02:43:59.019 --> 02:44:00.081]  You're part of the insiders.
[02:44:00.941 --> 02:44:01.782]  When you say
[02:44:02.915 --> 02:44:06.199]  We are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to be here.
[02:44:06.500 --> 02:44:07.721]  Precisely what do you mean?
[02:44:08.102 --> 02:44:15.772]  Well, to get access to the inside, CNN and the other regime media pay hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[02:44:15.792 --> 02:44:16.453]  The other, sorry?
[02:44:16.473 --> 02:44:17.434]  Regime media.
[02:44:17.534 --> 02:44:18.055]  Excuse me?
[02:44:18.575 --> 02:44:20.137]  Regime, R-E-G-I-M-E.
[02:44:20.157 --> 02:44:20.898]  Excuse me?
[02:44:20.978 --> 02:44:21.139]  Yes.
[02:44:22.341 --> 02:44:23.442]  My God, you know!
[02:44:23.943 --> 02:44:25.545]  You are... This is fascinating.
[02:44:25.805 --> 02:44:27.407]  You're not doing very well as an answerer.
[02:44:27.447 --> 02:44:29.570]  You're good as an asker, but not as an answerer.
[02:44:29.590 --> 02:44:33.454]  You are employing more cameras to try and get me.
[02:44:33.534 --> 02:44:34.496]  I'm not trying to get your mates.
[02:44:34.536 --> 02:44:35.817]  I'm trying to get an answer from you.
[02:44:35.857 --> 02:44:36.298]  It's different.
[02:44:37.554 --> 02:44:38.154]  Lovely weather.
[02:44:38.574 --> 02:44:40.095]  Tell me, you've been here every single year.
[02:44:40.135 --> 02:44:41.215]  We bumped into you last year.
[02:44:42.155 --> 02:44:44.536]  This year, the theme is regaining trust.
[02:44:44.656 --> 02:44:48.818]  Why do you think your lords here at WEF have lost so much trust?
[02:44:48.838 --> 02:44:49.058]  Stop it!
[02:44:49.178 --> 02:44:49.458]  Stop it!
[02:44:49.938 --> 02:44:55.580]  Rephrase the question in a neutral fashion and you might stand a chance of getting an answer.
[02:44:55.600 --> 02:44:56.480]  Like CNN does?
[02:44:58.356 --> 02:45:01.458]  You don't like it when it's, uh... Listen, I think you're a great question asker.
[02:45:01.498 --> 02:45:02.018]  I watch you.
[02:45:02.058 --> 02:45:02.699]  I love your voice.
[02:45:02.719 --> 02:45:03.459]  So answer my questions.
[02:45:03.559 --> 02:45:04.260]  Answer my questions.
[02:45:04.300 --> 02:45:05.000]  What's your purpose?
[02:45:05.321 --> 02:45:10.504]  My purpose is to find out how you can be an objective journalist but also pay to be part of the team.
[02:45:10.524 --> 02:45:12.265]  But you're assuming we pay to be part of the team.
[02:45:12.285 --> 02:45:12.906]  I know you do.
[02:45:13.186 --> 02:45:13.466]  What?
[02:45:13.606 --> 02:45:13.866]  Show me.
[02:45:13.946 --> 02:45:17.889]  All of these organizations along here pay an enormous amount of money to Klaus Schwab.
[02:45:17.909 --> 02:45:19.710]  And do you see us along here?
[02:45:19.910 --> 02:45:21.271]  No, you're in the inner sanctum.
[02:45:21.852 --> 02:45:26.115]  Uh, for which we pay for the facilities of studios and broadcast... Sure.
[02:45:26.335 --> 02:45:27.676]  If that lets you sleep at night, mate...
[02:45:28.496 --> 02:45:30.218]  We pay for that in all sorts of venues.
[02:45:30.658 --> 02:45:30.998]  You know what?
[02:45:31.018 --> 02:45:31.839]  We pay for the facilities.
[02:45:31.919 --> 02:45:39.526]  And I assure you, sir, I assure you, the numbers you have for what we might pay for facilities, i.e.
[02:45:39.946 --> 02:45:42.088]  electricity, tables... And access.
[02:45:42.408 --> 02:45:42.568]  No.
[02:45:42.708 --> 02:45:44.430]  Hundreds of thousands of dollars for tables, sir.
[02:45:44.450 --> 02:45:45.471]  They're golden tables.
[02:45:45.691 --> 02:45:46.311]  Yes, yes.
[02:45:46.572 --> 02:45:48.053]  There is no payment for access.
[02:45:48.233 --> 02:45:51.416]  Let me just say this again, to be absolutely clear.
[02:45:51.596 --> 02:45:52.537]  The access is a bonus.
[02:45:53.157 --> 02:45:54.899]  The access is part of my job.
[02:45:56.112 --> 02:45:56.452]  And you would.
[02:46:25.382 --> 02:46:27.604]  How do we get that back?
[02:46:28.584 --> 02:46:31.006]  Looks of all this also full of opportunities.
[02:46:31.486 --> 02:46:41.894]  My questioning of Klaus Schwab has been over the years some of the more difficult and, if you will, uncomfortable for Wes.
[02:46:42.074 --> 02:46:42.694]  I don't believe that.
[02:46:42.714 --> 02:46:49.579]  World Economic Forum's theme this year, rebuilding trust, where it aims to hit the target.
[02:46:50.279 --> 02:46:53.662]  That's also the philosophy of the Davos Curling Club.
[02:46:54.560 --> 02:46:59.467]  So when the skip says, here, you make the curl like that.
[02:46:59.988 --> 02:47:01.611]  So that's why it's called curling.
[02:47:01.631 --> 02:47:02.492]  Because you curl.
[02:47:02.572 --> 02:47:03.433]  It's curls.
[02:47:04.054 --> 02:47:04.675]  It's curls.
[02:47:04.755 --> 02:47:05.136]  Yes.
[02:47:05.877 --> 02:47:06.939]  Look at what I say about it.
[02:47:06.959 --> 02:47:08.421]  Look at the articles I've written about it.
[02:47:08.721 --> 02:47:09.663]  I say basically...
[02:47:10.353 --> 02:47:11.494]  My fundamental view on wealth?
[02:47:12.135 --> 02:47:12.355]  Yes.
[02:47:12.415 --> 02:47:14.156]  A lot of what happens here is a waste of time.
[02:47:14.436 --> 02:47:15.878]  A lot of it is far too expensive.
[02:47:16.078 --> 02:47:22.243]  But there is real value in people coming together at the beginning of the year to see where they stand on controversial or political issues.
[02:47:22.263 --> 02:47:27.487]  With no democratic oversight, no opposition party, and no independent journalists.
[02:47:27.868 --> 02:47:29.429]  It is a crypto government.
[02:47:29.929 --> 02:47:31.911]  It's a lobbyist festival.
[02:47:32.271 --> 02:47:33.792]  It's unregistered lobbyists.
[02:47:34.253 --> 02:47:35.234]  You get away with things.
[02:47:35.314 --> 02:47:35.514]  Right.
[02:47:35.774 --> 02:47:36.995]  You have now transgressed.
[02:47:37.375 --> 02:47:39.716]  You have followed me for the last however many minutes.
[02:47:39.996 --> 02:47:42.377]  I've made it clear I didn't particularly want to be interviewed.
[02:47:42.417 --> 02:47:43.377]  I've given you some answers.
[02:47:43.677 --> 02:47:44.598]  Now will you let me proceed?
[02:47:44.618 --> 02:47:44.978]  Go ahead.
[02:47:44.998 --> 02:47:46.078]  I've never been in your safe space.
[02:47:46.098 --> 02:47:50.100]  You're about to go past the gate, but... Oh, I love it.
[02:47:50.140 --> 02:47:52.681]  Why do you think we don't get access, but you do?
[02:47:52.901 --> 02:47:54.722]  I really love the fact.
[02:47:55.262 --> 02:47:55.903]  Really love it!
[02:47:56.443 --> 02:48:03.949]  That you will take whatever I say, in however I say it, and manage to turn it either... We've learned from the master!
[02:48:03.969 --> 02:48:06.572]  We've learned from the master!
[02:48:06.592 --> 02:48:07.332]  You're doing it now!
[02:48:07.552 --> 02:48:09.694]  And either turn it against me...
[02:48:10.945 --> 02:48:18.870]  Or against CNN, or against anybody else that you deem to be unworthy of your approval.
[02:48:19.050 --> 02:48:19.691]  Well done, sir.
[02:48:19.731 --> 02:48:21.152]  Go with the masters of the universe.
[02:48:21.232 --> 02:48:22.112]  Go with your people.
[02:48:22.513 --> 02:48:23.713]  Go to your people.
[02:48:23.933 --> 02:48:24.554]  Those are your people.
[02:48:24.574 --> 02:48:25.995]  I'm looking forward to seeing how you edit this.
[02:48:26.615 --> 02:48:27.636]  It'll be raw, my friend.
[02:48:27.656 --> 02:48:28.156]  Uncut.
[02:48:28.456 --> 02:48:28.837]  Excellent.
[02:48:29.057 --> 02:48:40.064]  In which case, you will fully understand it's not particularly pleasant at half past nine in the morning to be ambushed by one, two, three, four, five people.
[02:48:41.915 --> 02:48:45.276]  I don't even deploy that many people when I'm going to interview a president.
[02:48:45.296 --> 02:48:47.376]  You've got that many people in the makeup room alone.
[02:48:47.396 --> 02:48:50.757]  There's many criminals here we would love to hold accountable.
[02:48:51.397 --> 02:48:53.058]  And I think CNN often... VIP alert!
[02:48:53.078 --> 02:48:54.318]  VIP coming through!
[02:48:54.398 --> 02:48:55.118]  Clear the way!
[02:48:55.238 --> 02:48:56.079]  ...supports it.
[02:48:56.259 --> 02:48:59.620]  CNN often is the one that props these criminals up.
[02:48:59.660 --> 02:49:00.500]  I wouldn't call them criminals.
[02:49:00.520 --> 02:49:01.340]  I'm not going to call them criminals.
[02:49:02.407 --> 02:49:05.850]  Not him, I'm saying who's a prop up you?
[02:49:06.190 --> 02:49:09.533]  He's a journalist, so when he has questions to ask, you know it.
[02:49:09.833 --> 02:49:11.674]  He'll ask tough questions when he wants to.
[02:49:12.195 --> 02:49:15.517]  But he won't ask tough questions in there because you have to be part of the club.
[02:49:15.838 --> 02:49:18.620]  And if you stink up the joints, you won't be allowed back in.
[02:49:18.660 --> 02:49:22.002]  We know that because one of our colleagues was accredited last year.
[02:49:22.363 --> 02:49:24.124]  He was blackballed this year.
[02:49:24.524 --> 02:49:27.146]  And I think that, I think we cut him to the quick.
[02:49:27.166 --> 02:49:30.209]  I think he was very thin skin, which is unusual for him.
[02:49:30.849 --> 02:49:32.970]  Because I think we were getting a little too close to the truth.
[02:49:33.610 --> 02:49:36.231]  So, Richard Quest, at least talk to you.
[02:49:36.331 --> 02:49:42.473]  Usually they say nothing, but I know Everett predicted you guys were running to him, uh, in the next 24 hours.
[02:49:42.493 --> 02:49:43.213]  You guys did.
[02:49:43.593 --> 02:49:45.533]  Who else have you guys confronted that isn't out yet?
[02:49:48.394 --> 02:49:54.996]  There is a massive list and it's about, uh, it's 10 to 9 and I, my, my mind's gone blank.
[02:49:55.036 --> 02:49:56.397]  Well, who have we got on our list?
[02:49:56.877 --> 02:49:57.637]  Give me some names.
[02:49:57.657 --> 02:50:00.318]  We've got human rights watch, we've got, um,
[02:50:01.607 --> 02:50:04.749]  I had a quick one with Carmela Harris's husband.
[02:50:05.049 --> 02:50:05.910]  That's about to come out.
[02:50:06.690 --> 02:50:08.031]  Nice, quick, juicy, fun one.
[02:50:09.051 --> 02:50:10.392]  Um, who else was it?
[02:50:10.432 --> 02:50:12.453]  There was that useless senator.
[02:50:13.114 --> 02:50:14.855]  There's a whole... You've done a great job.
[02:50:14.915 --> 02:50:16.856]  Join us again tomorrow as more unfolds.
[02:50:17.196 --> 02:50:18.577]  We've got a few minutes to break here.
[02:50:18.597 --> 02:50:20.378]  Uh, what else do you want to talk about?
[02:50:20.478 --> 02:50:21.639]  Witnessing the love of us.
[02:50:21.659 --> 02:50:24.060]  You know, they talk about wanting to gain trust back.
[02:50:24.100 --> 02:50:26.582]  The biggest thing is they know the world knows their
[02:50:27.222 --> 02:50:29.303]  Penetrating the cabinets, as Klaus Schwab said.
[02:50:29.603 --> 02:50:31.223]  They're trying to set up their world government.
[02:50:31.523 --> 02:50:33.264]  They seem to be on the defense at some level.
[02:50:33.284 --> 02:50:33.744]  What do you think?
[02:50:35.004 --> 02:50:35.744]  Absolutely.
[02:50:35.804 --> 02:50:36.664]  They are on the defense.
[02:50:36.704 --> 02:50:43.126]  And that's why, you know, a few years ago you would have never... Most people didn't know what the WF was.
[02:50:43.606 --> 02:50:45.487]  And now they're talking about regaining trust.
[02:50:45.547 --> 02:50:47.407]  Because they know they've lost that trust.
[02:50:47.927 --> 02:50:48.887]  I don't think it's going to work.
[02:50:49.287 --> 02:50:55.269]  I think people are finally waking up to this dangerous, dangerous organization.
[02:50:55.851 --> 02:50:58.491]  Well, they've said, I played the clips yesterday, the head of the EU, all of them.
[02:50:58.772 --> 02:51:01.012]  The number one threat's disinfo, silencing us.
[02:51:01.372 --> 02:51:02.592]  All you're doing is asking questions.
[02:51:02.632 --> 02:51:03.372]  Why are they so scared?
[02:51:05.873 --> 02:51:09.133]  Because they don't, they don't want people knowing the truth.
[02:51:09.794 --> 02:51:10.194]  That's it.
[02:51:12.174 --> 02:51:14.194]  Well, I can't wait to see what else comes.
[02:51:14.234 --> 02:51:21.176]  We already played it yesterday, but you confronted John Kerry, Tedros, the head of the WHO, the Blackstone Group.
[02:51:21.196 --> 02:51:22.476]  I mean, you guys are knocking it out of the park.
[02:51:25.137 --> 02:51:27.378]  Yeah, there is a lot more to it.
[02:51:27.739 --> 02:51:34.663]  The viewers head to WFReports.com I think every hour, probably in the next few hours, we're going to have a new video up.
[02:51:34.683 --> 02:51:36.564]  So, worth checking them out.
[02:51:36.844 --> 02:51:38.545]  Alright, well thank you for all the time.
[02:51:38.565 --> 02:51:40.666]  I didn't mean to spend too much time on the ADL.
[02:51:40.786 --> 02:51:43.428]  It's just that, yeah, it's so obvious what they're doing.
[02:51:43.728 --> 02:51:44.868]  A minute closing comment.
[02:51:45.169 --> 02:51:46.790]  We had to get it off our chest, Alex.
[02:51:47.310 --> 02:51:48.511]  We had to get that off our chest.
[02:51:48.531 --> 02:51:50.532]  But I know, I wasn't expecting to go on about that.
[02:51:52.211 --> 02:51:58.105]  But I'll make time and we'll spend some more time talking about the West in general over the next few days.
[02:51:58.767 --> 02:51:59.629]  Alright, talk to you soon.
[02:51:59.649 --> 02:52:00.170]  Thanks for the time.
[02:52:01.212 --> 02:52:01.653]  Thanks, mate.
[02:52:02.833 --> 02:52:24.173]  Alright folks, we are back live here with our guest leaders, we're just live them, we're back live with just good old Jones here, and I mean I gotta tell you, it's so obvious the global survive Ukraine, it's so obvious they're behind the Santa Israel stuff, and it doesn't mean I support Israel and we're doing, I am sitting back and saying what is the larger plan, why is this
[02:52:25.114 --> 02:52:32.764]  When you couldn't ever talk about the 7th of the past, I mean, I agree, if you criticize Israel in any way, you've censored her before, that was wrong, the Israel lobby's wrong, I talk about that.
[02:52:33.105 --> 02:52:39.734]  But now it's super cool to attack Israel, and people think, oh, we're winning, we're gonna get the head of the snake, that's not the head of the snake, folks.
[02:52:41.420 --> 02:52:45.081]  It's these big central banks that are taking over.
[02:52:45.482 --> 02:52:52.784]  It's the policies of cutting off the carbon, shutting down the farmers, shutting down the infrastructure, destroying the fertilizer.
[02:52:53.004 --> 02:52:54.305]  I mean, that's real.
[02:52:55.025 --> 02:52:56.066]  You know who owns it?
[02:52:56.146 --> 02:52:56.746]  Who runs it?
[02:52:56.786 --> 02:52:57.566]  Who's in control of it?
[02:52:58.026 --> 02:52:59.287]  This is all in down.
[02:53:00.603 --> 02:53:03.264]  It's extremely dangerous time to be alive.
[02:53:04.085 --> 02:53:05.565]  I've got some other news I want to hit.
[02:53:06.246 --> 02:53:13.189]  I mentioned this earlier, but we don't normally have computer crashes with our systems, but we've had a lot of crashes today for whatever reason.
[02:53:13.229 --> 02:53:15.530]  But guys, we have the clip of Don Junior.
[02:53:17.651 --> 02:53:18.071]  We have it.
[02:53:18.351 --> 02:53:18.631]  Okay.
[02:53:18.711 --> 02:53:23.673]  Don Junior says Tucker Carlson is on the table to be dad's VP.
[02:53:24.314 --> 02:53:24.574]  Okay.
[02:53:25.569 --> 02:53:27.310]  I love Don Jr.
[02:53:27.450 --> 02:53:29.511]  I love his joke about making the Press Secretary.
[02:53:29.551 --> 02:53:30.651]  I think he's a great guy.
[02:53:31.032 --> 02:53:33.393]  He's teasing a 2028 run.
[02:53:33.553 --> 02:53:34.433]  I love Don Jr.
[02:53:34.453 --> 02:53:35.994]  I think he's a great guy.
[02:53:36.634 --> 02:53:39.035]  But I've talked to Tucker and everybody else has talked to Tucker.
[02:53:39.435 --> 02:53:43.037]  He is not running for Trump's VP.
[02:53:43.077 --> 02:53:44.178]  He doesn't want power.
[02:53:44.638 --> 02:53:46.939]  He wants to fish and hunt all day and do his shows.
[02:53:47.479 --> 02:53:48.680]  And he's not going to be Trump's VP.
[02:53:49.884 --> 02:53:52.305]  So it's hype to sit there and say he's on the table.
[02:53:52.625 --> 02:53:57.807]  Well, maybe he's on the table because Malani and Trump have asked him, and by the way they have.
[02:53:59.708 --> 02:54:02.529]  And Tucker said on air, and I've talked to him off air.
[02:54:03.889 --> 02:54:08.991]  And said God would have to, because I read this in the news, I talked to Tucker.
[02:54:09.471 --> 02:54:14.633]  He said God would have to appear before me and tell me to run as VP.
[02:54:17.375 --> 02:54:18.176]  It's not happening.
[02:54:18.857 --> 02:54:21.540]  We need to talk about who Trump's real VP will be.
[02:54:22.080 --> 02:54:23.142]  Somebody he can trust.
[02:54:23.722 --> 02:54:27.206]  And so, um, this is just hype from Don Jr.
[02:54:27.246 --> 02:54:27.547]  Here it is.
[02:54:28.749 --> 02:54:31.010]  Could you see your father running with Ron DeSantis?
[02:54:31.090 --> 02:54:34.131]  I asked him that question over the summer, and he didn't rule it out.
[02:54:34.411 --> 02:54:36.292]  Could you see Ron DeSantis?
[02:54:36.732 --> 02:54:49.156]  It's hard, you know, people do that, you know, I would do whatever I could to make sure it wasn't Nikki Haley, but, you know, Ron DeSantis, you're never going to rule out someone that is, you know, a leading contender.
[02:54:49.176 --> 02:54:50.436]  It doesn't mean that's who you go with.
[02:54:50.476 --> 02:54:51.377]  I could see other people.
[02:54:51.417 --> 02:54:51.937]  That would be great.
[02:54:52.817 --> 02:54:53.398]  We're good to go.
[02:55:13.601 --> 02:55:41.745]  I would admit you know that's clearly it would be on the table right I mean there they're very friendly I think they agree on virtually all these things they certainly agree on stopping the never ending wars and so you know I would love to see that happen you know that was certainly being tender Ben Carson those rumors legit that Ben's great I mean what a what a great what a great American someone who was just steadfast and all that's enough all of the insanity of the last year so the news headline is deceptive I mean
[02:55:43.755 --> 02:55:44.536]  Always on the table.
[02:55:45.096 --> 02:55:45.316]  Yeah.
[02:55:45.697 --> 02:55:47.178]  It's fair to say they love Tucker.
[02:55:47.579 --> 02:55:48.599]  Not happening.
[02:55:49.200 --> 02:55:50.201]  Put the money in the bank.
[02:55:50.721 --> 02:55:51.402]  Guarantee it.
[02:55:51.842 --> 02:55:52.483]  Not happening.
[02:55:52.963 --> 02:55:53.824]  You heard it here first.
[02:55:54.565 --> 02:55:54.845]  Alright.
[02:55:55.726 --> 02:55:57.828]  We got Drew Hernandez who always knocks it out of the park.
[02:55:58.749 --> 02:56:00.110]  On the whole new allure system.
[02:56:00.750 --> 02:56:02.572]  About to come up and host the 4th hour.
[02:56:03.213 --> 02:56:07.797]  And then the mighty Owen Schroer 3pm central standard time.
[02:56:09.298 --> 02:56:13.122]  We'll be hosting The War Room, the former political prisoner, Owen Schroer.
[02:56:13.802 --> 02:56:20.489]  Before I end this transmission, we really need Sean Strickland as Trump's VP.
[02:56:20.949 --> 02:56:24.012]  I'm trolling a little bit, but I covered that last hour.
[02:56:24.373 --> 02:56:25.494]  We're going to put that out.
[02:56:26.835 --> 02:56:49.555]  On X very very soon the left is going to go crazy and it'll make Sean Strickland's comments get 10 more million views so we're going to have some fun but we need somebody with that no compromise attitude and not always giving the left the authority bowing down to them like they're the social bosses they're the high priest they have all the answers no you don't
[02:56:50.629 --> 02:56:51.570]  I want to ask listeners again.

[02:57:09.839 --> 02:57:10.640]  You keep putting them out.
[02:57:11.060 --> 02:57:12.240]  I'll repost them.
[02:57:12.521 --> 02:57:13.481]  You're having a great effect.

[02:58:24.846 --> 02:58:25.047]  I think?
[02:58:25.067 --> 02:58:25.207]  I think?

[02:59:14.105 --> 02:59:14.305]  I think?

[02:59:50.978 --> 02:59:54.900]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:07.446 --> 03:00:12.349]  What is going on Info Warriors Info Wars dot com band dot video.
[03:00:12.369 --> 03:00:14.470]  I'm your guest host Drew Hernandez.
[03:00:14.490 --> 03:00:19.954]  You are now watching the fourth hour of the most band and sensor transmission in the universe.
[03:00:19.994 --> 03:00:21.254]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:21.715 --> 03:00:26.497]  Welcome to every single one of you guys and to continue on with what's going on with Davos in 2024.
[03:00:26.818 --> 03:00:33.862]  Yes, it is absolutely very interesting that our theme for this year is regain trust.
[03:00:34.634 --> 03:00:57.018]  Now if you really think about who these people are and how satanic and deceptive they really are, they're not genuinely trying to wipe up their ways and clean up their satanic and globalist new world order authoritarian ways attempting to weaponize the future of technology and weaponize information and weaponize the governments of the world in order to
[03:00:58.061 --> 03:00:59.883]  Control the minds of millions of people.
[03:00:59.903 --> 03:01:03.566]  They're not backtracking on the climate change death coal operation.
[03:01:03.606 --> 03:01:06.289]  They're not backtracking on the death jab.
[03:01:06.309 --> 03:01:08.471]  The future technologies of that, by the way.
[03:01:08.992 --> 03:01:14.297]  It looks like Bill Gates made this very clear with his little stop in Davos in an interview with Bloomberg.
[03:01:15.778 --> 03:01:17.541]  That there's a new technology on the way.
[03:01:17.681 --> 03:01:21.305]  They're on out new patches where they won't even really need the jabs anymore.
[03:01:21.545 --> 03:01:34.741]  You're still gonna get the death vaccine, but you're gonna get it distributed differently via a patch with micro needs and Bill Gates has made that very clear that that's where they are going next and they're spending tens of millions of dollars.
[03:01:35.783 --> 03:01:38.685]  To bring this technology to the entire world.
[03:01:39.226 --> 03:01:41.989]  And so we know that's the future with disease X on the horizon.
[03:01:42.029 --> 03:01:46.173]  We know the future with their pathogens that they will launch on mankind.
[03:01:46.213 --> 03:01:55.542]  We've seen all of the massive corporations and vaccine distribution distributor companies and CEOs all on the same wavelength even the
[03:01:56.102 --> 03:02:19.743]  CDC talking heads and all the proxies with the World Health Organization all just happened to know that there is something coming in the future there's gonna be some kind of pathogen that's gonna be worse than COVID-19 that mankind is gonna have to deal with and the governments of the world are gonna have to deal with and that's why the UN is pushing very aggressively in the United States of America to seize legally legislatively
[03:02:20.646 --> 03:02:29.085]  Emergency powers, basically martial law, top head, globalist, emergency powers from the CDC and the World Health Organization, where they get to declare...
[03:02:29.995 --> 03:02:30.175]  I think?
[03:02:30.195 --> 03:02:30.355]  I think?
[03:02:30.375 --> 03:02:30.695]  I think?
[03:02:30.715 --> 03:02:30.955]  I think?
[03:02:30.975 --> 03:02:31.396]  I think?
[03:02:31.456 --> 03:02:31.696]  I think?
[03:02:31.716 --> 03:02:31.856]  I think?
[03:02:31.876 --> 03:02:32.056]  I think?
[03:02:32.096 --> 03:02:32.316]  I think?
[03:02:32.356 --> 03:02:32.756]  I think?
[03:02:32.816 --> 03:02:32.956]  I think?
[03:02:32.976 --> 03:02:33.196]  I think?
[03:02:33.216 --> 03:02:33.516]  I think?
[03:02:33.536 --> 03:02:33.936]  I think?
[03:02:33.956 --> 03:02:34.236]  I think?
[03:02:55.194 --> 03:03:12.286]  And the rollout of COVID and the mass lockdowns and the death jab vaccine mandates and the mask mandates and testing how the children respond to the mask mandates and testing how mankind responds to the lockdown and just how far they could really take it.
[03:03:12.326 --> 03:03:14.127]  That's where the future is going to go.
[03:03:14.167 --> 03:03:17.970]  And yes, Bill Gates made it official the next generation of vaccines.
[03:03:18.490 --> 03:03:20.672]  They will be micro needle patches.
[03:03:21.694 --> 03:03:21.934]  I think?
[03:03:21.954 --> 03:03:22.215]  I think?
[03:03:22.235 --> 03:03:22.675]  I think?
[03:03:22.695 --> 03:03:22.855]  I think?
[03:03:49.420 --> 03:04:18.892]  And this is what Infowars role always be is being ahead of the times tomorrow's news today putting out what's not popular but what's essential putting out the truth but way will literally come with persecution because you're ahead of the time that's truly what an info warrior is it's an individual that's ahead of their time it's an individual that's willing to speak the truth way ahead of what the establishment whether left or right has pre approved not only in the media but in the culture for people to talk about
[03:04:20.087 --> 03:04:23.912]  And if you could understand that, then you understand what this information word truly is.
[03:04:23.952 --> 03:04:24.672]  You want to know why?
[03:04:25.053 --> 03:04:26.895]  Because the other side understands that.
[03:04:27.436 --> 03:04:41.071]  Because the other side, when you have these CIA operations, and you have these NSA ops, and all these intelligence agents, carrying out their psychological operations on both sides, Republican, Democrat, the general public, worldwide.
[03:04:42.003 --> 03:04:42.864]  They understand that.
[03:04:43.345 --> 03:04:45.989]  And they understand that they have to get ahead of the population.
[03:04:46.029 --> 03:04:47.391]  They have to get ahead of the times.
[03:04:47.912 --> 03:04:50.375]  They have to get their narrative out front.
[03:04:51.016 --> 03:04:52.178]  10, 15, 20 years ahead.
[03:04:52.659 --> 03:04:55.343]  Because that's how they control generations of individuals.
[03:04:55.683 --> 03:04:56.244]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:56.284 --> 03:04:56.825]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:04:59.520 --> 03:05:00.921]  Last year we put this book out.
[03:05:01.761 --> 03:05:04.982]  The Great Reset and the Wolf of the World became a number one national bestseller.
[03:05:05.562 --> 03:05:08.824]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[03:05:09.324 --> 03:05:14.166]  The Great Awakening, The Plan to Defeat the Globos, and Launch the Second Great Renaissance.
[03:05:14.566 --> 03:05:16.227]  This is such a powerful book.
[03:05:16.627 --> 03:05:18.308]  It covers all the Globos plans.
[03:05:18.968 --> 03:05:25.235]  The latest developments, how to stop them, and then gives an alternate plan of a society we could build together.
[03:05:25.555 --> 03:05:27.097]  That's why it's the Great Awakening.
[03:05:27.117 --> 03:05:29.219]  The Great Awakening is happening right now.
[03:05:29.460 --> 03:05:34.305]  You can get signed or unsigned copies of the book at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:05:34.585 --> 03:05:35.907]  This is a historic book.

[03:05:55.173 --> 03:05:55.993]  It's a powerful book.
[03:05:56.213 --> 03:05:56.813]  Get yours now.
[03:06:02.555 --> 03:06:05.636]  Now why are they seeking to regain the trust?
[03:06:06.872 --> 03:06:11.477]  The New World Order Super Conference that they have at the beginning of every single year, which is interesting.
[03:06:12.358 --> 03:06:14.180]  Because, uh, Rebel News is killing it.
[03:06:14.240 --> 03:06:14.901]  And you saw that.
[03:06:15.582 --> 03:06:18.144]  You saw that in one of these, uh, New World Order hacks.
[03:06:19.105 --> 03:06:22.249]  That, uh, Avi was really pinning down and questioning.
[03:06:22.978 --> 03:06:23.879]  And he said it himself.
[03:06:24.139 --> 03:06:24.859]  He said it himself.
[03:06:24.899 --> 03:06:25.800]  He said, oh, we gay.
[03:06:26.180 --> 03:06:28.582]  We come together at the beginning of every single year.
[03:06:28.662 --> 03:06:36.148]  We come together at the beginning of every single year to talk about the hardships that we have to face at the head of every single year.
[03:06:36.168 --> 03:06:38.429]  These people want to be ahead of their time.
[03:06:38.449 --> 03:06:40.711]  These people want to be ahead of your generation.
[03:06:41.211 --> 03:06:44.734]  These people want to be ahead of everyone's
[03:06:45.914 --> 03:06:46.494]  Reality.
[03:06:47.015 --> 03:06:54.059]  Now what I mean by that is, this is why you'll hear Klaus Schwab say, we need to be masters of the technology of today and the future in order to be what?
[03:06:54.119 --> 03:06:55.340]  Masters of the future.
[03:06:55.961 --> 03:07:01.644]  Because these people are on the same wavelength of this anti-Christ spirit and agenda and system.
[03:07:02.305 --> 03:07:06.628]  And so with that God complex within their mind, they adopt that.
[03:07:06.808 --> 03:07:14.473]  They adopt the anti-Christ mindset, which is not just an individual that's in opposition to Jesus Christ, the Bible and everything that God stands for.
[03:07:15.624 --> 03:07:18.068]  Antichrist is a pseudochrist in the position.
[03:07:18.088 --> 03:07:24.937]  A false actor, a counterfeit, an individual that has usurped the authority or attempting to look like they are.
[03:07:25.618 --> 03:07:29.303]  So these people will adopt the mindset where they have a god-like complex.
[03:07:30.177 --> 03:07:32.178]  They believe they're the saviors of the universe.
[03:07:32.618 --> 03:07:34.899]  They believe that they're the masters of the future.
[03:07:35.439 --> 03:07:38.221]  They believe that they're the masters and the architect of time.
[03:07:38.661 --> 03:07:41.142]  This is why they want to rewrite the narrative of the future.
[03:07:41.182 --> 03:07:43.763]  This is why they have an Agenda 2020, Agenda 2021, Agenda 2025, Agenda 2030, and Agenda 2050.
[03:07:43.803 --> 03:07:46.564]  Because these people, they believe that they are the overseers of time.
[03:07:55.254 --> 03:08:05.256]  Okay, when it comes to the globalist mindset, you have to understand from this biblical, serious, spiritual perspective, this anti-Christ mindset, it is a messianic complex.
[03:08:06.084 --> 03:08:09.045]  And they believe in their own minds that they're the saviors of humanity.
[03:08:09.365 --> 03:08:11.866]  And they view you as a weak, pathetic peasant.
[03:08:12.366 --> 03:08:13.907]  That cannot do anything for themselves.
[03:08:13.947 --> 03:08:15.127]  That's why they look down on you.
[03:08:15.167 --> 03:08:16.227]  They won't answer questions.
[03:08:16.267 --> 03:08:17.548]  If you actually go to Switzerland.
[03:08:17.928 --> 03:08:19.288]  Just like what Rebel News is doing.
[03:08:19.668 --> 03:08:20.589]  Question these people.
[03:08:20.649 --> 03:08:21.849]  You'll get an answer here and there.
[03:08:22.309 --> 03:08:23.810]  But they will not speak to you.
[03:08:23.850 --> 03:08:25.050]  Not because they're afraid.
[03:08:25.130 --> 03:08:26.591]  They will not speak to you.
[03:08:26.631 --> 03:08:27.751]  Not because they're afraid.
[03:08:28.251 --> 03:08:29.992]  You're going to take their words out of context.
[03:08:30.032 --> 03:08:32.573]  No, they won't speak to you because you are a piece of trash.
[03:08:34.617 --> 03:08:39.125]  You are a pathetic peasant that lives directly under their boot.
[03:08:39.666 --> 03:08:42.190]  Okay, they view you as a nuisance.
[03:08:42.811 --> 03:08:45.216]  They view you as something that needs to be exterminated.
[03:08:45.236 --> 03:08:46.358]  These are the same people!
[03:08:47.071 --> 03:09:08.645]  That are on the same wavelength with Bill Gates that are totally okay with depopulating the Earth, whether it's via pushing homosexuality, STDs and AIDS, or whether it's via pushing the death jabs and depopulating humanity through the mRNA, or whether it's pushing abortion, which is literally dismembering, slaughtering human sacrifice and fenticide of baby.
[03:09:09.265 --> 03:09:32.926]  It doesn't matter whichever deep population agenda you wanna go with these people are totally for it they support it and they champion it and they celebrate it and that is how they normalize it within cultures not only in the United States of America but worldwide no matter what country you go to they all sound the same they may speak a different language but they all sound the same they may be speaking a totally different tongue
[03:09:33.406 --> 03:09:35.548]  But the agenda and the spirit is the same.
[03:09:35.728 --> 03:09:40.132]  Because you really have to tie this all the way back to the origin of what it really is.
[03:09:40.172 --> 03:09:41.754]  And the origin is the father of lies.
[03:09:41.954 --> 03:09:44.116]  This goes back to the Garden of Eden.
[03:09:44.136 --> 03:09:45.257]  This goes to the serpent.
[03:09:45.738 --> 03:09:46.959]  The ultimate globalist.
[03:09:47.019 --> 03:09:48.900]  That's where the globalism originates.
[03:09:48.960 --> 03:09:50.622]  It's the heart of Lucifer itself.
[03:09:51.002 --> 03:09:52.364]  It's carried out throughout the scripture.
[03:09:52.384 --> 03:09:53.645]  You see this with the Tower of Babel.
[03:09:54.258 --> 03:10:09.595]  You see this throughout the entire scriptures, all the way to the end time scenario, before the second coming of Jesus Christ and the rise of the Antichrist and the New World Order, the One World Militarized System, the One World Economic System, the One World Satanic Religion, the One World Establishment.
[03:10:10.259 --> 03:10:14.581]  And the frontman will be the Antichrist, all empowered by Satan and Lucifer himself.
[03:10:14.601 --> 03:10:21.505]  Say, Drew, why are you really bringing it to that level when you're talking about Davos and the World Economic Forum?
[03:10:22.065 --> 03:10:23.666]  Because all of these people are pushing.
[03:10:23.686 --> 03:10:28.849]  You see, the problem is the devil masquerades as an angel of light.
[03:10:29.787 --> 03:10:40.035]  And so Satan will propose and present himself for these demonic legions, especially in a political environment, especially in a government or a cultural environment.
[03:10:40.916 --> 03:10:46.160]  The art of deception is presenting your something that is safe, wholesome, acceptable.
[03:10:46.600 --> 03:10:47.821]  That's there to protect you.
[03:10:47.841 --> 03:10:58.950]  The ultimate deception is convincing the target that you're there to protect them from a threat outside that is trying to destroy them, hurt them or their family.
[03:10:59.864 --> 03:11:13.710]  And this is essentially the direction that the WEF, Davos, Klaus Schwab, guys like Bill Gates, BlackRock, CDC, World Health Organization, Fauci, you name it, right?
[03:11:14.130 --> 03:11:16.692]  All of the usual suspects.
[03:11:17.232 --> 03:11:18.132]  ADL, you name it.
[03:11:19.113 --> 03:11:20.153]  Fill in the blank, okay?
[03:11:20.193 --> 03:11:20.753]  Fill in the blank.
[03:11:20.773 --> 03:11:21.274]  Doesn't matter.
[03:11:21.314 --> 03:11:21.854]  Fill in the blank.
[03:11:22.617 --> 03:11:25.259]  They all go with that same tactic.
[03:11:25.680 --> 03:11:28.742]  We are here to protect you from misinformation.
[03:11:29.103 --> 03:11:31.565]  We're here to protect you from disinformation.
[03:11:31.765 --> 03:11:34.828]  We're here to protect you from those scary MAG Republicans.
[03:11:35.088 --> 03:11:42.514]  We're here to protect you from a second administration of Donald Trump, which is going to be accompanied with a dictatorial authoritarian regime.
[03:11:42.774 --> 03:11:44.556]  We're here to protect you and prevent.
[03:11:44.756 --> 03:11:46.057]  We're the prevention squad.
[03:11:46.097 --> 03:11:49.200]  We are the globalist kumbaya utopian
[03:11:50.422 --> 03:12:11.633]  Prevention squad of authoritarianism so they paint a picture very beautifully by the way if you really if you really take a look at it they paint this picture and very convincing of some kind of threat and this is where you know people get into you know Project Blue Beam in the future where they believe that they will stage alien invasions with their advanced aerospace technology that goes beyond
[03:12:12.805 --> 03:12:15.846]  Uh, what we know to be the laws of physics and gravity.
[03:12:15.906 --> 03:12:23.568]  This is when you really start getting into how powerful and capable the Deep State and New World Order governments of the world truly are.
[03:12:24.369 --> 03:12:26.049]  Well, they will prop up a threat.
[03:12:26.809 --> 03:12:32.311]  And as they prop up the threat, they convince the target that a solution is needed to protect themselves.
[03:12:33.078 --> 03:12:39.443]  And the solution isn't necessarily to, well, you have the Second Amendment, go strap up and buy tons of ammunition and let's hold down the fort.
[03:12:39.483 --> 03:12:41.185]  It's the Alamo, the United States of America.
[03:12:41.205 --> 03:12:42.186]  No, no, no, no.
[03:12:42.226 --> 03:12:44.027]  What they do is they strip you of your rights.
[03:12:44.688 --> 03:12:47.050]  What they do is they strip you of all of your autonomy.
[03:12:47.650 --> 03:12:49.692]  And what they do is they strip you of even education.
[03:12:50.327 --> 03:13:03.633]  And what they do is they strip you of every source, outside source, that is not pre-approved, and that is not coming down the lane, or is that not coming down from the stream, that has all been vetted, pre-approved and allowed.
[03:13:03.653 --> 03:13:04.994]  This is the flow of information.
[03:13:05.014 --> 03:13:07.875]  What I'm explaining to you guys is literally how this information war works.
[03:13:08.315 --> 03:13:15.559]  This is done through the media, through education, through every influential institution you could possibly think of, not in America, but worldwide.
[03:13:15.939 --> 03:13:16.079]  I think?
[03:13:16.099 --> 03:13:16.420]  I think?
[03:13:16.500 --> 03:13:16.840]  I think?
[03:13:16.860 --> 03:13:17.000]  I think?
[03:13:17.020 --> 03:13:17.321]  I think?
[03:13:34.381 --> 03:13:42.045]  They will harness and weaponize to propagate to mankind their pre-approved satanic message of global unification and utopia.
[03:13:42.265 --> 03:13:44.567]  See the problem is that they prop themselves up.
[03:13:44.947 --> 03:13:55.393]  They are the abuser and they are also the protector and they prop themselves up in the media and the culture as such through a humanitarian effort.
[03:13:55.453 --> 03:14:00.055]  And see this is what the world economic forum these globus powers are really good at.
[03:14:00.195 --> 03:14:01.176]  They're really good at.
[03:14:01.636 --> 03:14:30.116]  Because anyone could take a look at a Lil Nas X and he's blaspheming Christ, he's simulating getting satized by Satan and he's writing down a homosexual stripple pull down to hell and he's you know having a one on one game with Lucifer and heaven in his new music video and he's blaspheming the table of communion and his promotions for his music video all kinds of Satanic imagery see that's obvious that's obvious and that's obvious to pick up on
[03:14:31.101 --> 03:14:38.066]  And people can see that and line that up with what the Bible has to say, and that's, that's, that's, that's not that advanced.
[03:14:38.707 --> 03:14:45.291]  That's just a, that kid Lil Nas X is just some homosexual Hollywood music industry plant prostitute.
[03:14:45.792 --> 03:14:48.614]  Literally getting pimped out by Satan, it's just, it's interesting.
[03:14:48.654 --> 03:14:58.301]  But the way the World Economic Forum goes about this, and the way that these globalist entities go about this, and they've been doing it really good for the past few decades.
[03:14:59.247 --> 03:15:06.215]  Is that they prop themselves up as this humanitarian machine that wants to bring humanity together.
[03:15:07.076 --> 03:15:11.221]  And it's a message of unity that sounds convincing and sounds safe.
[03:15:11.822 --> 03:15:16.787]  But they prop up their message of unity and they prop up the problems.
[03:15:16.867 --> 03:15:19.651]  This is why they have their yearly gatherings.
[03:15:20.402 --> 03:15:36.022]  They prop up the problems, they prop up the threats, they prop up the imminent threats to civilization and humanity, climate change, or whether it be MAGA Republicans, or disinformation, misinformation, or some kind of looming health threat that's going to come by the year 2035.
[03:15:36.063 --> 03:15:36.864]  This is why they do this.
[03:15:39.545 --> 03:15:46.830]  And at the same time, they have all of their proxies throughout world governments that have already stripped freedoms from free mankind.
[03:15:47.250 --> 03:15:53.694]  So when they hit that button, and it's time to punch in whatever that operation is, you don't even have the freedoms to defend yourself.
[03:15:53.734 --> 03:15:54.395]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:57.005 --> 03:16:00.667]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[03:16:01.407 --> 03:16:06.090]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:16:06.650 --> 03:16:18.576]  They are both clones of national best-selling products from a major pharmaceutical-slash-supplement maker that are listeners and patriots that are allowing us to private label it at a lower price you'll find in stores.
[03:16:18.996 --> 03:16:22.158]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[03:16:22.978 --> 03:16:35.566]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain and also make your nerves healthier, which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more inductive to paint.

[03:16:56.772 --> 03:17:04.857]  Real death is shutting off the economy, the bureaucrats and the corporations control economy, as they vertically economy consolidate power, they murder people in mass.
[03:17:05.498 --> 03:17:18.166]  Anyone must is warned them, that if you destroyed some nation, you will have certain redouts of it, certain city states still have it, the hunger games model, it will destroy the elite as well, anybody that studies history, as common sense knows that.
[03:17:18.806 --> 03:17:21.349]  I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think
[03:17:41.032 --> 03:17:41.512]  We're good to go.
[03:17:41.532 --> 03:17:41.793]  I think?
[03:17:41.813 --> 03:17:42.273]  We're good to go.
[03:17:42.293 --> 03:17:42.533]  I think?
[03:18:04.872 --> 03:18:17.841]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections, masqueradings, vaccines.
[03:18:18.761 --> 03:18:27.027]  It's so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives, oblivious, and you realize ignorance is not bliss, it equals death.
[03:18:29.080 --> 03:18:30.001]  We're good to go.
[03:18:30.021 --> 03:18:30.201]  I think?
[03:18:30.241 --> 03:18:30.582]  I think?
[03:18:56.991 --> 03:19:00.714]  Why do you think the globalist are desperately trying to censor everybody.
[03:19:01.034 --> 03:19:22.072]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else because they can get through this giant mega Michael power grab and we're exposing him but we're not just exposing their operation in my new book we give you the solutions to build a new better world an alternative to close swabs you will eat the bugs this is the great awakening
[03:19:22.592 --> 03:19:26.497]  The plan to defeat the Globist and launch the Second Great Renaissance.
[03:19:26.957 --> 03:19:28.439]  It's a companion in my last book.
[03:19:28.739 --> 03:19:30.481]  It was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[03:19:30.761 --> 03:19:33.284]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.
[03:19:33.625 --> 03:19:37.449]  Get your copy of The Great Awakening today at Infowars.com.
[03:19:37.469 --> 03:19:37.709]  I think?
[03:19:37.729 --> 03:19:37.989]  I think?
[03:20:08.598 --> 03:20:10.039]  We're good to go.
[03:20:10.299 --> 03:20:11.020]  I think?
[03:20:11.180 --> 03:20:11.580]  I think?
[03:20:11.680 --> 03:20:12.300]  I think?
[03:20:12.401 --> 03:20:12.801]  I think?
[03:20:12.921 --> 03:20:13.581]  I think?
[03:20:13.641 --> 03:20:14.062]  I think?
[03:20:32.994 --> 03:20:36.395]  Um, a lot of new people are flooding in, and it's good.
[03:20:36.855 --> 03:20:38.655]  And this is why they didn't want Alex on.
[03:20:38.675 --> 03:20:41.616]  Twitter 1.0, and the old regime, and the old guard.
[03:20:42.596 --> 03:20:45.657]  Because there's a lot of people that are getting exposed to this information.
[03:20:46.037 --> 03:20:47.317]  And we're fully aware of that.
[03:20:47.337 --> 03:20:59.760]  And we're fully aware of people that are maybe tuning in for the very first time, and they're like, let me see what's going on with this guy Alex Jones, or Infowars, or anybody else that might pop up on the show.
[03:21:00.914 --> 03:21:21.337]  And so breaking down this information, uh, for people that may be curious or people that have heard of the World Economic Forum and people that have heard of Klaus Schwab and are starting to view them in negative light, um, you gotta come with the receipts and the facts and you gotta come with just exactly why these people should not be trusted.
[03:21:21.357 --> 03:21:26.978]  Because we're not like the left where we just slander individuals and we sit there and we say, well, they're bad, don't listen to them.
[03:21:27.018 --> 03:21:28.619]  No, that's commie, that's, that's cult.
[03:21:29.559 --> 03:21:30.379]  And we're not a cult.
[03:21:31.284 --> 03:21:34.267]  We deal with truth the way the truth in the live Jesus Christ.
[03:21:35.168 --> 03:21:42.415]  And so when you're dealing with an entity like the World Economic Forum and all these globalist organizations that have been getting exposed for decades.
[03:21:43.616 --> 03:21:45.338]  They're really not that hard to expose.
[03:21:45.658 --> 03:21:46.779]  I think that's the point.
[03:21:47.139 --> 03:21:51.523]  I think that's really the point and when people they get red pills.
[03:21:51.583 --> 03:21:56.248]  They get seriously red pills when they discover wow a lot of these decisions being made around the globe.
[03:21:56.866 --> 03:21:57.166]  I think?
[03:21:57.186 --> 03:21:57.386]  I think?
[03:21:57.406 --> 03:21:57.706]  I think?
[03:21:57.726 --> 03:21:57.866]  I think?
[03:22:25.518 --> 03:22:29.321]  And these people believe in a global identity.
[03:22:29.381 --> 03:22:31.943]  These people believe in a cashless society.
[03:22:31.983 --> 03:22:37.047]  These people believe in a centralized hub for all of humanity to be identified in.
[03:22:37.267 --> 03:22:41.410]  They believe in the hive mind because they believe that that's going to bring us unified.
[03:22:41.951 --> 03:22:50.337]  And the mind of a globalist may or may not believe that what they're believing in is the right thing to believe in.
[03:22:50.718 --> 03:22:53.560]  A lot of these globalists have serious satanic intentions.
[03:22:54.495 --> 03:22:59.338]  Some of them may just believe that, well, what's so wrong with being unified?
[03:22:59.358 --> 03:23:01.039]  Well, I'll tell you what's the problem with that.
[03:23:01.559 --> 03:23:04.801]  Because their definition of unification is ultimate tyranny.
[03:23:04.901 --> 03:23:06.842]  Bow down to the surveillance state.
[03:23:07.162 --> 03:23:09.544]  Sacrifice, especially if you're an American.
[03:23:09.584 --> 03:23:11.245]  Throw away your constitutional rights.
[03:23:11.645 --> 03:23:13.526]  Throw away your God-given and inalienable rights.
[03:23:13.586 --> 03:23:16.968]  Because that's what separates you from their global unification.
[03:23:18.251 --> 03:23:19.933]  They don't want governors of states.
[03:23:20.573 --> 03:23:23.676]  They don't want, especially particularly United States of America.
[03:23:23.736 --> 03:23:29.662]  They don't want the states of the union to have any form of autonomy, even outside of the federal government.
[03:23:29.802 --> 03:23:31.263]  They don't even want a federal government.
[03:23:32.204 --> 03:23:42.994]  They want an over arching, okay, technocracy mixed with technology, a globalist, scientific slash
[03:23:44.326 --> 03:23:47.991]  Health, and when I say health, they just guise themselves like a Fauci.
[03:23:48.011 --> 03:23:49.033]  They throw a disguise.
[03:23:49.794 --> 03:23:51.617]  Okay, it's this, it's this satanic...
[03:23:52.325 --> 03:24:13.599]  Scientific slash medical health industry technocracy globalist over arching world government surveillance state that they want to impose on humanity and that's what they've been going with the past couple decades and they fully in my opinion launch that in 2020 I mean really look around you they lock down the entire world in 2020.
[03:24:15.484 --> 03:24:21.207]  Dude, they literally told you that you needed to mask... At first, Fauci told you you don't need to mask up.
[03:24:21.787 --> 03:24:22.468]  That's absurd.
[03:24:22.528 --> 03:24:24.249]  Well, actually, you do need to mask up.
[03:24:24.449 --> 03:24:25.830]  Well, actually, you need to wear two.
[03:24:26.230 --> 03:24:27.530]  Actually, you need to wear three.
[03:24:27.751 --> 03:24:30.212]  And by the way, when the vaccines come, you need that too.
[03:24:31.198 --> 03:24:33.160]  Oh, by the way, the vaccine isn't enough.
[03:24:33.400 --> 03:24:35.823]  You're gonna need like six boosters after that.
[03:24:36.023 --> 03:24:44.191]  And here we are fast forward to 2024 Bill Gates straight up telling people that those vaccines are not sufficient.
[03:24:44.551 --> 03:24:48.195]  We need a new technology that will make the vaccines last longer.
[03:24:48.255 --> 03:24:53.821]  So we're doing away with the actual syringes and we're gonna go with the patches with the micro needles.
[03:24:54.884 --> 03:24:56.786]  See, this is what people are waking up to, man.
[03:24:56.846 --> 03:25:12.982]  And people have to wake up that all of this, these are not well-intended people that are trying to give you medical advice, or these are not well-intended people behind meta that are the fact-checkers that are trying to protect you from lies and misinformation and disinformation.
[03:25:13.542 --> 03:25:27.809]  These are not well-intentioned people within the intelligence agencies, the FBI, which has now come out, that apparently that the Feds are surveilling and monitoring anyone that makes a financial transaction with the word Trump or MAGA in it.
[03:25:28.049 --> 03:25:29.910]  These are not well-intentioned people.
[03:25:30.491 --> 03:25:33.272]  These are not people that are believing the wrong thing.
[03:25:33.292 --> 03:25:41.456]  These are not people that are sitting there saying to themselves, well, we believe that this is actually a threat, so we're doing everything possible.
[03:25:42.228 --> 03:25:54.376]  It's not like we're living in World War II and these people view Adolf Hitler as a threat and the Allies want to get together and take down that threat because it's a global threat.
[03:25:54.436 --> 03:26:02.382]  These people are viewing you, you, you, they're viewing you as an identified threat because you are.
[03:26:02.402 --> 03:26:06.705]  They view you as an identified threat because you are a threat.
[03:26:08.012 --> 03:26:29.282]  And see, this is where the psychological operation really warps people's minds, because when you and I hear that, what, agri-publicans, domestic terrorists, agri-publicans, a threat to democracy, we're calling for voter ID, and all these globalists and deep state entities, they all come down on us and call us racists and bigots and white supremacists, even if you're brown like me, or if you're black, doesn't matter!
[03:26:30.140 --> 03:26:32.222]  You see, that's the psychological operation.
[03:26:32.763 --> 03:26:35.045]  You do pose a threat to the New World Order.
[03:26:35.586 --> 03:26:38.168]  You do pose a threat to the surveillance state.
[03:26:38.729 --> 03:26:41.071]  You do pose a threat to the World Economic Forum.
[03:26:41.512 --> 03:26:42.473]  Because you're educated.
[03:26:42.753 --> 03:26:43.494]  You're articulate.
[03:26:44.094 --> 03:26:45.456]  You know exactly what's going on.
[03:26:45.516 --> 03:26:46.797]  You know the laws of the land.
[03:26:46.817 --> 03:26:49.300]  You understand your civil rights as an American.
[03:26:50.151 --> 03:26:56.654]  Okay, you understand what's going on, you see these people's plans for what they truly are, and they are originated in tyranny.
[03:26:57.034 --> 03:27:00.276]  So yes, of course you're going to be called a domestic terrorist.
[03:27:00.556 --> 03:27:03.757]  Of course you're going to be called a threat to their democracy.
[03:27:03.777 --> 03:27:07.339]  And what that means is you're a threat to our regime because you will speak out.
[03:27:08.479 --> 03:27:14.202]  That's why Infowars and anyone that's speaking the truth is always going to be a threat.
[03:27:15.222 --> 03:27:18.984]  Because if we have a platform and if we have mouths and we have
[03:27:19.799 --> 03:27:29.092]  Life in our bodies and if we have air in our lungs and we have the truth in our hearts, that is the greatest threat to this New World Order regime.
[03:27:29.784 --> 03:27:31.164]  Because the truth shall set you free.
[03:27:31.184 --> 03:27:49.970]  And the problem that they have, and the biggest thing that these entities fear, are millions of people receiving the truth, accepting the truth, waking up as a result, and clearly being breached and pulled out of the matrix to identify who truly are the enemies to humanity.
[03:27:50.790 --> 03:27:52.931]  And they truly are the minority in this scenario.
[03:27:54.551 --> 03:27:58.232]  They truly are the minority in this scenario, and the majority of Americans.
[03:27:58.272 --> 03:27:59.933]  This is why they want to depopulate the Earth.
[03:27:59.953 --> 03:28:01.113]  Does it start to make sense now?
[03:28:01.913 --> 03:28:10.436]  Because they don't want this populace truly waking up to the reality that there are these minority, these very specific families, organizations.
[03:28:11.076 --> 03:28:14.837]  It's like a handful of them on two hands that control the entire world.
[03:28:15.397 --> 03:28:16.617]  They control the world wars.
[03:28:16.657 --> 03:28:18.678]  They control everything and all the destinations.
[03:28:19.038 --> 03:28:21.859]  This is why they want to be masters of the future and masters of humanity.
[03:28:23.075 --> 03:28:28.761]  When billions of people start waking up to that, that's the information war, my friend.
[03:28:28.902 --> 03:28:30.804]  Like, that's what they fear.
[03:28:31.488 --> 03:28:33.210]  That puts a fear in their hearts.
[03:28:33.770 --> 03:28:42.258]  When billions of people, especially when they wake up to the reality of the gospel and Jesus Christ and they become born again, now they have a problem and they have a huge problem on their hands.
[03:28:42.859 --> 03:28:47.703]  Not for the purposes of violence, but for the purposes of people just not listening to their garbage anymore.
[03:28:47.743 --> 03:28:51.326]  That's why their theme this year in Davos 2024 is what?
[03:28:51.687 --> 03:28:52.888]  Regaining your trust.
[03:28:53.428 --> 03:28:54.429]  Don't fall for this crap.
[03:28:54.449 --> 03:28:56.131]  They're just a bunch of lying Satanists.
[03:28:56.986 --> 03:29:00.848]  Naturally sourced from the finest hemp plants in America.
[03:29:01.288 --> 03:29:07.491]  Rebel Zen offers the absolute finest quality CBD available and at the lowest prices.
[03:29:08.552 --> 03:29:16.836]  Extracted using a cold pressed technique to retain the molecular integrity of the cannabinoids and terpenes within the plant.

[03:29:24.339 --> 03:29:34.269]  Premium quality organic CBD, like Rebel Zen, has been shown to naturally reduce anxiety, relieve pain, and decrease inflammation.
[03:29:34.769 --> 03:29:42.376]  People have reported a reduction in symptoms of insomnia, arthritis, seizures, chronic pain, and epilepsy.
[03:29:42.856 --> 03:29:49.482]  Several studies have shown it helps to reduce cortisol, increase serotonin, and boost vitality.

[03:29:58.649 --> 03:30:00.070]  Last year we put this book out.
[03:30:00.911 --> 03:30:02.312]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[03:30:02.332 --> 03:30:04.113]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[03:30:04.693 --> 03:30:06.114]  Now we've put part two out.
[03:30:06.175 --> 03:30:07.936]  It's even thicker and more powerful.
[03:30:08.476 --> 03:30:09.377]  The Great Awakening.
[03:30:09.477 --> 03:30:13.320]  The Plan to Defeat the Globos and launch the Second Great Renaissance.
[03:30:13.720 --> 03:30:15.381]  This is such a powerful book.
[03:30:15.781 --> 03:30:17.463]  It covers all the Globos plans.
[03:30:18.063 --> 03:30:24.385]  The latest developments, how to stop them, and then gives an alternate plan of a society we could build together.
[03:30:24.685 --> 03:30:25.846]  That's why it's the Great Awakening.
[03:30:26.226 --> 03:30:28.347]  The Great Awakening is happening right now.
[03:30:28.587 --> 03:30:33.429]  You can get signed or unsigned copies of the book at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:30:33.709 --> 03:30:35.069]  This is a historic book.
[03:30:35.409 --> 03:30:36.710]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:30:37.270 --> 03:30:44.753]  This is next level information and it's a great way to not just support the podcast, but inform yourself for the next level and share the book with friends and family.
[03:30:45.013 --> 03:30:51.396]  So whether you want one copy or multiple copies, go now to info or store.com and get the great awakening.
[03:30:51.596 --> 03:30:52.837]  This is going to go to number one.
[03:30:53.097 --> 03:30:54.138]  I want to thank you for support.
[03:30:54.318 --> 03:30:55.118]  It's a powerful book.
[03:30:55.358 --> 03:30:55.938]  Get yours now.
[03:30:57.459 --> 03:31:00.560]  I talk a lot about the great successes and full wars has had.
[03:31:00.580 --> 03:31:02.161]  I don't think anyone can deny it.
[03:31:02.922 --> 03:31:05.923]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:31:06.832 --> 03:31:14.920]  When we talk about the crew in full force, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:31:15.780 --> 03:31:23.568]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroeder and the hard work they engage in every day, 5, 6, 7 days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:31:24.580 --> 03:31:27.442]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:31:27.462 --> 03:31:33.207]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:31:34.008 --> 03:31:37.010]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[03:31:37.050 --> 03:31:45.297]  But most viewers and listeners never go to Infowarsstore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time, just on air.
[03:31:45.977 --> 03:31:49.640]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at M4store.com.
[03:31:50.280 --> 03:31:54.923]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to M4store.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:31:55.223 --> 03:31:56.064]  Please take action now.
[03:31:56.264 --> 03:31:58.525]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[03:31:58.705 --> 03:31:59.046]  Thank you.
[03:31:59.226 --> 03:32:01.807]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[03:32:01.868 --> 03:32:03.128]  I started taking that stuff.
[03:32:03.168 --> 03:32:06.370]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[03:32:06.471 --> 03:32:07.371]  When did you start taking it?
[03:32:07.651 --> 03:32:11.594]  About 4 years ago, I had high blood pressure and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[03:32:12.255 --> 03:32:14.958]  And I started eating a little better, but my blood pressure stayed high.
[03:32:14.978 --> 03:32:22.508]  And when I took X2 iodine, after about three or four weeks, I think my body was detoxified of a bunch of metals and stuff that my body was storing.
[03:32:22.608 --> 03:32:24.831]  And my blood pressure came down to perfect level.
[03:32:25.212 --> 03:32:28.136]  And I tell people the only thing I did was X2 iodine.
[03:32:28.596 --> 03:32:42.466]  And even though I do think all your other products are good, I recommend to anybody that they start with X2 iodine because it detoxifies your body and kind of kicks your natural DNA into full force.
[03:32:42.566 --> 03:32:46.009]  So, in my life, I found X2 iodine to be best.
[03:32:46.509 --> 03:32:49.932]  I tried other iodines and they didn't have the same effect.
[03:32:50.132 --> 03:32:52.554]  So, X2 iodine, I really wanted to point that out.
[03:32:58.112 --> 03:33:02.206]  Lead up front assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:33:02.728 --> 03:33:04.033]  It's Alex Jones!

[03:33:37.828 --> 03:33:38.008]  I think?
[03:33:38.028 --> 03:33:38.768]  I think?
[03:33:38.788 --> 03:33:38.928]  I think?
[03:33:38.968 --> 03:33:39.348]  I think?
[03:33:39.368 --> 03:33:39.908]  I think?
[03:33:39.948 --> 03:33:40.289]  I think?
[03:33:40.329 --> 03:33:40.489]  I think?
[03:33:40.569 --> 03:33:40.929]  I think?
[03:33:40.949 --> 03:33:41.109]  I think?
[03:33:41.149 --> 03:33:41.369]  I think?
[03:34:07.139 --> 03:34:20.067]  I think we saw a little bit of a preview of what this, uh, what this power vacuum is going to look like, uh, with Trump no longer in the world of politics, uh, in a position of running for elected office.
[03:34:20.768 --> 03:34:31.134]  I think we all saw a little bit of that power struggle with, um, DeSantis turning his back on Trump and getting obliterated and Vivek trying to tell MAGA that we need him to save Trump.
[03:34:32.108 --> 03:34:32.448]  We're good to go.
[03:34:32.468 --> 03:34:33.148]  We're good to go.
[03:34:33.468 --> 03:34:34.309]  We're good to go.
[03:34:34.329 --> 03:34:34.829]  We're good to go.
[03:34:56.885 --> 03:35:09.811]  Uh, I mean look at Nikki Haley, she's getting protected by CNN, MSN, BC, literally have joy read up there defending Nikki Haley saying that she lost, she lost the Iowa caucus because of white evangelical Christians.
[03:35:10.649 --> 03:35:11.749]  Yeah, give me a break.
[03:35:12.309 --> 03:35:13.990]  Isn't it crazy how Joy Reid says that?
[03:35:14.010 --> 03:35:15.650]  This like woke black supremacist.
[03:35:15.890 --> 03:35:19.351]  She literally has a blonde wig on, just crapping on white people.
[03:35:19.391 --> 03:35:20.892]  Like what the hell is the matter with you?
[03:35:21.372 --> 03:35:24.133]  It's just like, it's like total mental retardation.
[03:35:24.613 --> 03:35:25.233]  Absolutely.
[03:35:25.273 --> 03:35:29.534]  But that's why, that's why people like Joy Reid are propped up on MSNBC to attack white people.
[03:35:29.754 --> 03:35:30.635]  Attack white people.
[03:35:30.875 --> 03:35:33.175]  Attack white people with a blonde wig on.
[03:35:33.435 --> 03:35:35.276]  Attack white people with a blonde wig on.
[03:35:35.296 --> 03:35:37.116]  Honor.
[03:35:37.296 --> 03:35:37.717]  Anyways.
[03:35:38.197 --> 03:35:38.657]  Anyways.
[03:35:38.937 --> 03:35:39.137]  But.
[03:35:40.111 --> 03:35:42.554]  Like I said, I think the real power vacuum is going to come in 2028.
[03:35:43.275 --> 03:35:44.157]  Things are going to get wild.
[03:35:44.197 --> 03:35:47.361]  So, all that to say, supportinfowarsstore.com.
[03:35:47.401 --> 03:35:52.808]  Make sure that you guys are getting into the fight at some capacity by supporting the tip of the spear.
[03:35:54.371 --> 03:35:55.212]  Continuing on...
[03:35:56.201 --> 03:35:56.861]  With Davos.
[03:35:57.061 --> 03:36:01.943]  Let me show you guys some examples of what's been going on these past few days.
[03:36:02.624 --> 03:36:07.605]  And the European Commission President claims disinformation the world's gravest threat of 2024.
[03:36:09.426 --> 03:36:11.307]  She made herself very clear in her speech.
[03:36:12.247 --> 03:36:18.212]  For the global business community the top concern for the next two years is not conflict or climate.
[03:36:18.652 --> 03:36:26.177]  She said in her Davos speech it is disinformation and misinformation followed closely by polarization within our societies.
[03:36:26.677 --> 03:36:35.884]  She said many of the solutions lie not only in countries working together but crucially on businesses and governments businesses and democracies working together and she said while many governments
[03:36:36.664 --> 03:37:02.661]  Hold many of the levers of to deal with the great challenges of our time business have the innovation the technology the talents to deliver the solutions we need to fight threats like climate change or industrial scale disinformation and she said there will always be those who try to exploit our openness both from inside and out there will always be attempts to put us off track for example with disinformation and misinformation she also said in this statement that
[03:37:03.860 --> 03:37:11.123]  These globalists will play a role in instructing governments of the world just exactly how they need to combat misinformation and disinformation.
[03:37:11.903 --> 03:37:21.347]  And see, this is where people start to take an issue with these entities like the World Economic Forum because they get to dis... they literally get to dictate, okay?
[03:37:21.367 --> 03:37:25.289]  They get to define just exactly what disinformation and misinformation
[03:37:25.942 --> 03:37:43.923]  Means so this is why I'm sounding the alarm especially here on Infowars.com and maybe those that are maybe finding Alex on X and they've never really listened to Alex before and they've been listening to Alex ever since he's come back on X and I'm like whoa man like there might be something to do not fall
[03:37:44.523 --> 03:37:49.008]  For their fake fraudulent attempts at regaining your trust.
[03:37:49.589 --> 03:37:49.969]  Okay?
[03:37:50.350 --> 03:37:56.837]  They're not attempting to regain your trust by curing their ways and righting their wrongs of the past.
[03:37:57.158 --> 03:37:59.160]  Because they're not openly saying anything like that!
[03:37:59.520 --> 03:38:03.564]  What they're attempting to do is fine tune their message of propaganda.
[03:38:03.864 --> 03:38:06.886]  What they're attempting to do is take it to the next level.
[03:38:07.187 --> 03:38:20.718]  What they're attempting to do is clearly take their psychological manipulations through all of their proxies and their speakers on their panels throughout Davos 2024 to make it sound more appealing, more humanitarian and more welcoming.
[03:38:21.298 --> 03:38:22.680]  This is the art of deception.
[03:38:23.200 --> 03:38:26.303]  This is the devil masquerading as an angel of light.
[03:38:27.163 --> 03:38:27.644]  Further
[03:38:28.470 --> 03:38:41.276]  Diving deeper into levels of deception that are higher in advancement and that are more convincible by appearing to be something safe and appearing to be something that you could trust your own child with.
[03:38:41.937 --> 03:38:45.378]  Appearing to be something that has your best intentions in mind.
[03:38:46.899 --> 03:38:48.480]  Like those famous words that were said.
[03:38:48.500 --> 03:38:51.341]  You need to run away and I'm paraphrasing.
[03:38:51.661 --> 03:38:54.843]  When you hear the words I am the government and I am here to help you.
[03:38:56.306 --> 03:38:59.948]  People need to really understand what that means, and it's not just government anymore.
[03:38:59.988 --> 03:39:02.649]  I am the World Economic Forum, and I am here to help you.
[03:39:02.669 --> 03:39:06.812]  I am... I am Nicholas Schwab, and I am here to help you.
[03:39:06.832 --> 03:39:10.754]  Okay, like, I... I am Bill Gates, and I am here to help you.
[03:39:10.854 --> 03:39:11.034]  Like...
[03:39:12.890 --> 03:39:14.551]  You David, fill in the blank, dude.
[03:39:15.071 --> 03:39:17.632]  Alright, I'm the CDC and I'm here to help you.
[03:39:17.652 --> 03:39:20.953]  I am the World Health Organization and I am here to help you.
[03:39:20.993 --> 03:39:22.314]  No, they are not here to help you.
[03:39:22.334 --> 03:39:27.776]  They are here to exploit you, manipulate you, and monetize you, and depopulate you.
[03:39:27.856 --> 03:39:28.877]  That's what they're here for.
[03:39:29.817 --> 03:39:35.159]  Okay, those levels of monetization will come with... They're already doing it with mass sterilization.
[03:39:35.520 --> 03:39:36.080]  They're already doing it.
[03:39:36.576 --> 03:39:38.418]  They're already doing it with mass sterilization.
[03:39:38.658 --> 03:39:44.224]  They've convinced Gen Z, a majority of Gen Z, not all of Gen Z, that hacking their genitals is fine.
[03:39:44.284 --> 03:39:48.748]  If you're a little boy and you feel like you're a girl, well just chop your penis off and you'll feel fine.
[03:39:49.028 --> 03:39:50.370]  And vice versa for a female.
[03:39:51.110 --> 03:39:51.791]  Sterilization.
[03:39:51.951 --> 03:39:52.692]  Depopulation.
[03:39:53.763 --> 03:40:06.181]  It convinced millennials that homosexuality is totally fun and great, but they refuse to actually acknowledge that the spread of STDs and AIDS and HIV is gonna shorten your lifespan and they don't have the ability to repopulate.
[03:40:06.201 --> 03:40:06.902]  That's just a fact.
[03:40:09.401 --> 03:40:30.789]  And then they have also gone with other generations to convince them that you don't need to be involved with technology just let the kids do it for you you don't need to learn how to use any piece of the technology to learn so you could survive into the future just get a young kid to come in and do it for you you don't understand that the world economic form even praise on that with some older generations
[03:40:31.658 --> 03:40:35.041]  Yes, when they talk about technology, Klaus Schwab has talked about this many times.
[03:40:35.621 --> 03:40:39.624]  They believe if they're going to be masters of the future, they need to be masters of technology.
[03:40:40.044 --> 03:40:57.838]  They've talked about this many times on their panels that they will be the ones to facilitate older generations to assist them to learn how to use the technologies of the future so they could be the ones to transition them and teach them and disciple them
[03:40:58.769 --> 03:41:06.014]  How to take those next generations, Gen X or Boomers, into the future to teach them how these technologies are meant to be used.
[03:41:06.034 --> 03:41:07.715]  No, how about you think for yourself?
[03:41:08.433 --> 03:41:09.814]  How about you learn for yourself?
[03:41:10.014 --> 03:41:19.321]  Why the hell do you need Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum and all these globalist entities to teach you how to use an iPhone or to teach you how to use a piece of technology?
[03:41:19.621 --> 03:41:25.526]  Never, never intellectually end up in a place where you are no longer learning or thinking for yourself.
[03:41:25.746 --> 03:41:26.987]  I don't care how old you are.
[03:41:27.227 --> 03:41:28.668]  I don't care how young you are.
[03:41:30.770 --> 03:41:36.734]  All of these people do is pontificate on how to control the entire world and they declare it.
[03:41:37.751 --> 03:41:40.772]  They declare at the World Economic Forum present right there you see on your screen.
[03:41:41.372 --> 03:41:43.233]  Davos 2024, it never fails guys.
[03:41:43.353 --> 03:41:46.934]  Every single year one of them will declare a new world order.
[03:41:47.715 --> 03:41:50.796]  And he said we are on the way to a new order.
[03:41:50.836 --> 03:41:55.037]  And he was actually asking a question to the panelist.
[03:41:55.698 --> 03:41:59.819]  He asked them how do we, and I'm paraphrasing, how do we transition?
[03:41:59.859 --> 03:42:04.221]  If we're going to transition out of the world order from World War II,
[03:42:05.365 --> 03:42:09.348]  How do we transition safely into the new world order into the future?
[03:42:09.368 --> 03:42:34.649]  I see this is what people need to see and this is what people need to experience I challenge every single one of you and I challenge people every single year since I've been on the air and I've had a platform and I've been blessed by God to be able to communicate to thousands of people every single day which I'm thankful for I challenge any single one of you listen to Davos every single year listen to all their panels listen to all of their speakers
[03:42:35.367 --> 03:42:37.648]  Listen to everything they have to say in context.
[03:42:37.988 --> 03:42:39.528]  Listen to their own words.
[03:42:39.548 --> 03:42:40.268]  Don't listen to me.
[03:42:40.288 --> 03:42:44.569]  Don't listen to Alex Jones or Owen Schroer or Harrison Smith.
[03:42:44.749 --> 03:42:46.370]  You don't have to listen to any one of us.
[03:42:46.870 --> 03:42:49.110]  Go listen to these people for yourself.
[03:42:49.911 --> 03:42:54.632]  And you'll hear how psychotic they truly are with their globalist plans.
[03:42:54.672 --> 03:42:55.312]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:57.386 --> 03:43:08.579]  You know I said up here and I yell and scream about the new world order and the globus they're planning to run the borders and release a virus and have a global power grab and you saw it all come true but there's a
[03:43:09.719 --> 03:43:10.520]  inverse of that.
[03:43:11.240 --> 03:43:13.942]  There's not just the bad stuff I'm telling you about.
[03:43:14.282 --> 03:43:16.224]  There's the good stuff I'm telling you about.
[03:43:16.984 --> 03:43:19.886]  And just like our information is the best you're going to find out there.
[03:43:20.407 --> 03:43:21.648]  Our supplements are amazing.

[03:44:46.111 --> 03:44:50.261]  I'll live until the day I die or equal or fair, but I'll do my part to make sure you don't have a great day.
[03:44:57.234 --> 03:44:58.215]  29 years on air.
[03:44:58.535 --> 03:45:01.518]  All I wanted to do is warn the people about the globalist.
[03:45:02.238 --> 03:45:07.544]  And I've done the best job I can to tell them inaccurate and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[03:45:07.944 --> 03:45:10.487]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves.
[03:45:10.907 --> 03:45:14.390]  I'm like other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people.
[03:45:14.631 --> 03:45:15.311]  We don't do that.
[03:45:15.772 --> 03:45:17.674]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[03:45:18.034 --> 03:45:20.696]  And ladies and gentlemen I'm scared of this product is so powerful.
[03:45:21.597 --> 03:45:26.604]  This is the breakdown product, after your cells process it, of folic acid.
[03:45:27.185 --> 03:45:31.671]  Methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[03:45:32.132 --> 03:45:33.353]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[03:45:33.394 --> 03:45:34.255]  It's not a stimulant.
[03:45:34.515 --> 03:45:36.317]  It energizes your cells.
[03:45:36.878 --> 03:45:39.360]  And then everything else you take just supercharges it.
[03:45:39.420 --> 03:45:40.260]  It's so insane.
[03:45:40.600 --> 03:45:42.121]  It's foundational energy.
[03:45:42.582 --> 03:45:44.143]  The strongest formula out there.
[03:45:44.523 --> 03:45:46.724]  At Infowarsstore.com.
[03:45:47.104 --> 03:45:49.946]  It doesn't just energize this operation against the tyrants.
[03:45:50.026 --> 03:45:51.147]  It energizes you.
[03:45:51.427 --> 03:45:52.908]  Get foundational energy now!
[03:45:57.231 --> 03:46:03.535]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake in the global agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[03:46:04.921 --> 03:46:17.893]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections, masquerading as vaccines.
[03:46:18.773 --> 03:46:27.061]  He's so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives, oblivious, and he realized ignorance is not bliss, it equals death.
[03:46:28.695 --> 03:46:29.915]  We're good to go.
[03:46:29.955 --> 03:46:30.236]  I think?
[03:46:30.276 --> 03:46:30.696]  I think?
[03:46:30.736 --> 03:46:30.976]  I think?
[03:46:58.129 --> 03:47:02.213]  Leading up front assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:47:02.733 --> 03:47:04.014]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:22.073 --> 03:47:31.577]  I want to invite you guys to follow me on X at Drew H live also follow me I host my own show Drew Hernandez live Monday through Friday at 8 p.m.
[03:47:31.617 --> 03:47:32.597]  Pacific 11 p.m.
[03:47:32.698 --> 03:47:47.584]  Eastern Standard Time just go to rumble.com slash Drew Hernandez or just search Drew Hernandez I'm the only verified one on rumble so please make sure to go subscribe over there and follow me over there and I'll see you guys tonight so on with exposing
[03:47:48.513 --> 03:47:53.795]  The New World Order, Davos, and the globalist Luciferian agenda.
[03:47:54.475 --> 03:47:55.356]  Here's another example.
[03:47:55.976 --> 03:47:57.677]  They've coined a new term, by the way, in 2024.
[03:47:58.357 --> 03:47:58.997]  Ecoside.
[03:47:59.557 --> 03:48:03.199]  So this falls in line with the climate change death cult agenda.
[03:48:03.846 --> 03:48:25.761]  Because everything about the climate change their false profits they try to prophesy the end of the world every 12 years it seems that they have entire lifestyle you can drive a certain car you can have a certain refrigerator you can have a certain air conditioner everything has to be green and eco friendly absolutely everything even what you eat
[03:48:26.428 --> 03:48:27.509]  Eat your food, okay?
[03:48:27.549 --> 03:48:29.470]  They're going to ban everything at some point.
[03:48:29.870 --> 03:48:35.012]  Because everything creates too high of a carbon footprint so we have to be zero emissions.
[03:48:35.873 --> 03:48:36.893]  Here's an example of that.
[03:48:36.933 --> 03:48:39.014]  This is info wars.com obviously.
[03:48:39.034 --> 03:48:46.638]  The most ridiculous 75 seconds of BS from Davos yet on ego side.
[03:48:47.018 --> 03:48:52.101]  So it's interesting about this is a new coin has been termed.
[03:48:53.537 --> 03:49:12.474]  Uh, a new term has been coined, excuse me, from Jojo Mehta, founder of Stop Ecoside Now, explains in her upper class English accent to her ultra rich peers in Davos that quote, we have this cultural very ingrained habit of not taking damage to nature as seriously as we take damage to people or property.
[03:49:13.061 --> 03:49:14.242]  Definitely a tree hugger.
[03:49:14.402 --> 03:49:17.103]  This woman probably has sex with trees, not gonna lie.
[03:49:17.404 --> 03:49:24.568]  With human rights, mass murder and genocide are serious crimes, but there is no equivalent in the environmental space.
[03:49:25.168 --> 03:49:25.888]  Let me repeat that.
[03:49:25.948 --> 03:49:34.633]  She said, quote, with human rights, mass murder and genocide are serious crimes, but there is no equivalent in the environmental space.
[03:49:35.114 --> 03:49:42.578]  She went on to say, unlike an international crime like genocide that involves a specific intent with ecocide,
[03:49:43.248 --> 03:49:45.970]  That we see is that people are trying to do this.
[03:49:46.750 --> 03:49:48.671]  What people are trying to do is make money.
[03:49:49.912 --> 03:50:00.258]  Farm and fish and what's missing is an awareness of the side effects and collateral damage that happens and quote these are their own words ladies and gentlemen.
[03:50:00.298 --> 03:50:00.638]  Okay.
[03:50:01.298 --> 03:50:05.901]  So now these proxies and talking heads at the World Economic Forum.
[03:50:06.790 --> 03:50:17.816]  Are now attempting to coin the new term and this is what they do just like the CIA coins conspiracy theory and pushes that on all the targets to shame and chastise and humiliate them and discredit them.
[03:50:18.336 --> 03:50:22.718]  They do the same thing with their psychological operations and now they've coined the term ecocide.
[03:50:23.795 --> 03:50:30.098]  And this psycho on the World Economic Forum stage is attempting now think with her fear.
[03:50:30.218 --> 03:50:43.224]  Okay, like really think how insane these people are attempting to equate and make equivalent homicide and genocide to whatever she declares is a crime against the environment.
[03:50:44.865 --> 03:50:49.747]  So whatever, like I said, they're very vague about their ideas and they're very vague about their operations.
[03:50:49.787 --> 03:50:51.928]  They don't detail them
[03:50:53.346 --> 03:50:59.770]  Um, in a full scale, like vivid 4K, 8K, just you see every single detail.
[03:50:59.790 --> 03:51:01.771]  They're very vague about their operations.
[03:51:01.791 --> 03:51:03.472]  They're very vague about their agendas.
[03:51:03.773 --> 03:51:04.693]  And this is just another one.
[03:51:04.713 --> 03:51:07.355]  Like I said, they get to determine down in the future.
[03:51:07.375 --> 03:51:12.278]  And these people, they influence legislation, not just in America, but worldwide.
[03:51:12.318 --> 03:51:16.901]  That's why all these globalist politicians will show up to this so they can carry their ideas.
[03:51:17.797 --> 03:51:24.840]  Okay, and spread them across the globe and influence legislation in their own local or federal governments, whatever you name it.
[03:51:25.761 --> 03:51:30.363]  It's not eco side has now become a thing and I think this is this is not a surprise to anybody.
[03:51:30.983 --> 03:51:33.384]  We're in the new world order in the climate change death cult.
[03:51:33.724 --> 03:51:35.665]  You commit crimes against the environment.
[03:51:36.025 --> 03:51:38.086]  You have too high of a carbon footprint.
[03:51:38.446 --> 03:51:42.528]  And ultimately you always have some kind of a carbon footprint because you are a carbon base.
[03:51:43.168 --> 03:51:43.989]  So at some point,
[03:51:44.995 --> 03:51:46.717]  You will be neutralized.
[03:51:46.877 --> 03:51:48.439]  And it's like what John Kerry said as well.
[03:51:48.479 --> 03:51:51.623]  John Kerry made it very clear that, oh, we'll reach zero emissions.
[03:51:51.883 --> 03:51:57.049]  And no politician, no elected official is going to help you, is going to get us to those zero emissions.
[03:51:57.469 --> 03:51:58.150]  That's going to happen.
[03:51:58.190 --> 03:51:59.651]  The marketplace is going to do that.
[03:51:59.712 --> 03:52:06.179]  And they use these terms like marketplace and they use these terms like investors and shareholders when they're talking about
[03:52:06.699 --> 03:52:15.505]  They're globalists, and they're talking about the members of the World Economic Forum, and those that believe in the World Economic Forum's climate change, Green New Deal agenda.
[03:52:15.525 --> 03:52:18.947]  They call themselves shareholders, and they call themselves the marketplace.
[03:52:18.987 --> 03:52:20.589]  It's very globalist and cultish.
[03:52:22.069 --> 03:52:23.831]  But John Kerry made that very clear as well.
[03:52:23.871 --> 03:52:33.177]  He declared that no democratically elected politician can stop the climate change agenda or enforce it or bring them down to zero emissions.
[03:52:33.397 --> 03:52:34.538]  So put those two together.
[03:52:35.140 --> 03:52:42.307]  You have one globalist satanic climate change death cult advocate saying, well, we need to enforce eco side.
[03:52:42.627 --> 03:52:51.475]  And if anyone commits a crime against the environment, well, that's just as bad as committing genocide or homicide or you're just as bad as a serial killer.
[03:52:52.256 --> 03:52:53.116]  So what does that mean?
[03:52:53.256 --> 03:52:55.178]  I just have too high of a carbon footprint.
[03:52:55.198 --> 03:52:57.921]  I don't want to get a retarded EV.
[03:52:57.941 --> 03:53:01.404]  I don't want, I don't want a smart house that's
[03:53:02.370 --> 03:53:04.271]  Climate are economically friendly.
[03:53:04.371 --> 03:53:06.933]  I don't want to I don't want a home that's attached to the grid.
[03:53:07.273 --> 03:53:08.353]  I really don't like that stuff.
[03:53:08.393 --> 03:53:09.634]  I don't like any of that stuff.
[03:53:10.615 --> 03:53:12.456]  Because the government could have full access.
[03:53:12.716 --> 03:53:14.577]  Your home is connected directly.
[03:53:15.597 --> 03:53:18.579]  Your AC unit is connected directly to the internet.
[03:53:18.999 --> 03:53:21.280]  Your toaster, your refrigerator, everything.
[03:53:21.320 --> 03:53:24.462]  That's why they're pushing for full smart house technology.
[03:53:24.722 --> 03:53:26.343]  So it's on an internet grid.
[03:53:26.663 --> 03:53:31.646]  So when the government decides to flip that switch, they'll control your entire existence including your bank account.
[03:53:32.406 --> 03:53:38.671]  That's why they're on up the CBDCs, because they absolutely need that overarching again, how did I start the broadcast?
[03:53:38.872 --> 03:53:40.353]  They have a God like complex.
[03:53:40.393 --> 03:53:47.359]  They want to be all powerful, omnipotent over your entire life, and they'll use technology against you to in order to accomplish that.
[03:53:48.360 --> 03:53:51.643]  And so eco side is definitely the future in their agenda.
[03:53:51.983 --> 03:53:56.327]  Well, they will enforce their climate change death cult laws on humanity.
[03:53:57.268 --> 03:53:58.429]  You violate a tree.
[03:53:58.810 --> 03:54:00.191]  You violate the environment.
[03:54:00.612 --> 03:54:02.754]  Your carbon footprint is not low enough here.
[03:54:03.074 --> 03:54:04.976]  You are emitting way too emissions here.
[03:54:05.376 --> 03:54:07.799]  Well, it looks like that you're not going to be able to live.
[03:54:07.819 --> 03:54:10.862]  John Kerry comes along and says, we'll reach those zero emissions.
[03:54:11.162 --> 03:54:11.643]  Trust us.
[03:54:11.903 --> 03:54:12.383]  We will.
[03:54:12.423 --> 03:54:13.004]  It's impossible.
[03:54:13.024 --> 03:54:13.865]  You're never going to get that.
[03:54:14.935 --> 03:54:16.096]  You're never gonna get that.
[03:54:16.456 --> 03:54:22.500]  Mankind will have to absolutely, the globe, planet, earth will have to be erased entirely.
[03:54:22.881 --> 03:54:23.781]  That's the agenda.
[03:54:23.821 --> 03:54:25.623]  Depopulate, destroy humanity.
[03:54:25.823 --> 03:54:27.704]  Depopulate, destroy humanity.
[03:54:28.245 --> 03:54:36.891]  When John Kerry comes out, in my opinion, and says, we'll reach those zero emissions, oh, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna depopulate the earth.
[03:54:37.491 --> 03:54:38.932]  Oh, we will lower those emissions.
[03:54:39.412 --> 03:54:42.795]  Why do you think they have assisted suicides and programs in Canada?
[03:54:44.136 --> 03:54:46.179]  I think they've been building FEMA camps.
[03:54:46.559 --> 03:54:48.421]  Alex Jones has been exposing us for decades.
[03:54:48.441 --> 03:54:52.526]  Why do you think they've been building FEMA camps for decades across the United States of America?
[03:54:52.826 --> 03:54:59.514]  Oh, it's, it's, it's, well those FEMA camps are only in case we have some kind of crisis or natural disaster.
[03:54:59.695 --> 03:55:01.236]  Exactly, exactly, right.
[03:55:01.437 --> 03:55:03.199]  And who's pontificating the next?
[03:55:04.651 --> 03:55:23.336]  The next financial crisis due to AI or due to some kind of cybernetic attacker who's who's pontificating or projecting the next pathogen that will be released and we have another worldwide pandemic where everything has to be locked down who are all pontificating the next future crisis is crisis to happen within the next two decades.
[03:55:24.057 --> 03:55:29.018]  It's this satanic luciferian globalist organization that believes that they are God.
[03:55:29.952 --> 03:55:31.552]  Who gets to play God?
[03:55:31.612 --> 03:55:35.513]  Who gets to fill the shoes of God and the universe?
[03:55:35.573 --> 03:55:36.734]  Who gets that position?
[03:55:37.734 --> 03:55:38.134]  None of us.
[03:55:39.214 --> 03:55:40.435]  But that's Satan's heart.
[03:55:41.435 --> 03:55:42.435]  He wants to be God.
[03:55:42.495 --> 03:55:44.356]  He wants to ascend above the heavens.
[03:55:44.456 --> 03:55:46.376]  Ascend above the throne of God.
[03:55:46.416 --> 03:55:48.197]  He wants to act in the position of God.
[03:55:48.217 --> 03:55:51.157]  That's what got him thrown out of heaven and cast out.
[03:55:52.338 --> 03:55:53.978]  And that's why they all have the same heartbeat.
[03:55:54.645 --> 03:55:56.486]  That's why they all have the same veins.
[03:55:56.626 --> 03:56:00.029]  That's why they all have the same spirit, the same agenda, same mindset.
[03:56:00.229 --> 03:56:01.229]  They're all in unison.
[03:56:02.090 --> 03:56:07.994]  They're all in unison worldwide in their conferences, in their news conferences, in the media, in the culture.
[03:56:09.244 --> 03:56:26.174]  You name it, no matter where you look, education spaces, all these influential institutions, they all sound the same, they all sound the same, they have the same message, it's robotic, it's NPC, no matter what you want to call it, it is demonic, it is satanic, it is anti-Christ, that's why they're all in the same wavelength when it comes to these agendas.
[03:56:28.915 --> 03:56:34.999]  And the way that it's done, it's done they claim in your best interest in mind.
[03:56:36.337 --> 03:56:38.238]  They claim that they're here to protect you.
[03:56:38.638 --> 03:56:43.221]  We're here to protect you from disinformation and misinformation.
[03:56:43.601 --> 03:56:45.262]  We're here to enforce the law.
[03:56:45.782 --> 03:56:47.122]  Because it's being neglected.
[03:56:47.142 --> 03:56:50.244]  And if we enforce laws like eco side.
[03:56:50.584 --> 03:56:57.988]  Well then the population is going to fall in line and actually they probably actually believe it will give them an excuse to commit actual mass genocide.
[03:56:59.409 --> 03:57:01.071]  That's where the thing is going to get warped, man.
[03:57:01.111 --> 03:57:04.154]  You're good... You're... You commit... You commit ecocide.
[03:57:04.314 --> 03:57:09.920]  Well, that gives us an excuse to genocide humanity because your existence, you're not lowering your carbon footprint.
[03:57:10.060 --> 03:57:11.181]  Well, we're going to take you out.
[03:57:11.481 --> 03:57:12.563]  Off to the camp you go.
[03:57:12.923 --> 03:57:14.885]  Off to the assisted suicide center you go.
[03:57:15.285 --> 03:57:15.906]  Off you go.
[03:57:16.086 --> 03:57:18.589]  Off you go because we have to save the planet.
[03:57:19.490 --> 03:57:20.471]  Totally antichrist.
[03:57:21.091 --> 03:57:21.772]  It's satanic.
[03:57:22.509 --> 03:57:23.910]  I'll tell you that for damn sure.
[03:57:24.210 --> 03:57:25.351]  And you know what the good thing is?
[03:57:25.891 --> 03:57:27.012]  People are waking up to it.
[03:57:27.072 --> 03:57:31.615]  And people are realizing just exactly what this truly is.
[03:57:31.995 --> 03:57:32.995]  And it's deceptive.
[03:57:33.496 --> 03:57:34.636]  Well my name is Drew Hernandez.
[03:57:34.656 --> 03:57:36.978]  Thank you guys for tuning in to the 4th hour of the Alex Jones Show.
