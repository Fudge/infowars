[00:00:12.647 --> 00:00:20.568]  [MUSIC]
[00:00:20.568 --> 00:00:27.567]   In December of 2020, federal agents Lindsey and Ura approached Mr. Jeremy Brown at his home and
[00:00:27.567 --> 00:00:31.928]   asked him if he would be a paid informant for the government.
[00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:38.629]  They asked him to infiltrate some groups they were looking at involving concerns they had about an event in January.
[00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:52.638]   Mr. Brown recorded this conversation and instead of working for the government on January 6th, He went on as many media outlets that would have him, starting in March of 2021, and played the recording.
[00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.742]  He named the agents and exposed what they wanted him to do.
[00:00:56.762 --> 00:00:58.843]  So, it's no big deal.
[00:00:58.863 --> 00:01:00.144]  We decided to come out.
[00:01:00.164 --> 00:01:02.306]  I've worked with JTTF before.
[00:01:02.486 --> 00:01:04.328]  It's not in the future.
[00:01:05.174 --> 00:01:06.035]  So see, there you have it.
[00:01:06.295 --> 00:01:07.734]  Well, you might in the future.
[00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:09.535]  We don't care which way you lean.
[00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:12.974]   We just want to make sure that you're not targeting anybody and
[00:01:12.974 --> 00:01:16.054]  nobody's gonna get hurt over the outcome in January.
[00:01:16.054 --> 00:01:17.775]  We'd love to hear from you.
[00:01:17.775 --> 00:01:21.495]   And again, I can't make any promises, but you provide information.
[00:01:21.496 --> 00:01:28.496]   We think that we can help you, you can help us, and we can definitely on this side
[00:01:28.496 --> 00:01:29.496]  of things, less aggravation.
[00:01:29.496 --> 00:01:34.496]   You're one of 19 people that we're gonna knock on the door and say they're not home, or they
[00:01:34.496 --> 00:01:36.496]  are home, and we're like, can we go home?
[00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:44.496]   One of 19 people, these two guys, not the 58 other agents that he's about to explain
[00:01:44.496 --> 00:01:46.496]  that there's 60 of them in Tampa.
[00:01:47.306 --> 00:01:48.107]  I'm just one of 19.
[00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:56.690]  As a result of his righteous actions, the government had him arrested after an illegal search of his home on September of 2021.
[00:01:58.611 --> 00:02:03.858]  And after nearly two and a half years in federal prison, Jeremy has filed for an appeal.
[00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:16.514]  Jeremy's legal team is presenting forensic evidence that show the unregistered explosive grenades and the national defense documents that Jeremy was said to have illegally been in possession of.
[00:02:17.054 --> 00:02:21.538]  We're planted in his home by government agents during an illegal search.
[00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:29.645]  The first thing the agents did when they entered Mr. Brown's home for their search was turn off all 14 recording devices.
[00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:33.288]  And none of these agents had any functioning body cameras.
[00:02:33.708 --> 00:02:43.377]  The only person recording was Jeremy's girlfriend, who recorded the arrest by Agent Lindsay and Ura, who instructed her to stop recording, which she did.
[00:02:44.184 --> 00:02:48.387]  They were very deliberate in making sure nothing was recorded during their search.
[00:02:49.167 --> 00:03:00.235]  During this search, they allegedly found two explosive grenades and a CD containing National Defense documents, items that Mr. Brown denied knowing anything about.
[00:03:00.928 --> 00:03:11.254]  The grenades were tested for DNA, and the FBI's own experts found two male specimen DNAs on the grenades, none of which were from Jeremy Brown.
[00:03:12.075 --> 00:03:14.836]  They found a dog hair underneath one of the grenades.
[00:03:15.216 --> 00:03:25.543]  Mr. Brown has two dogs, so the FBI got a search warrant, took over 50 samples from his dogs, and determined that the hair on the grenade was not from his dogs.
[00:03:26.403 --> 00:03:30.647]  They found a carpet fiber on the tape around one of the grenades.
[00:03:31.148 --> 00:03:38.034]  So they get another search warrant, cut out pieces of Jeremy's carpet, and compare the fibers to the one that was found with the grenade.
[00:03:38.695 --> 00:03:40.837]  And they determine it was not a match.
[00:03:41.818 --> 00:03:55.516]  Criminal counts 6, 7, 8, and 9 were allegedly found on a compact disc that they claim Mr. Brown carried with him through the deserts of Kuwait and Afghanistan for 17 years.
[00:03:56.197 --> 00:03:59.862]  And yet, there isn't a scratch or a hint of discoloration on it.
[00:04:00.442 --> 00:04:06.307]  In August of 2022, there was a trace done on that CD to see when it was uploaded.
[00:04:06.727 --> 00:04:13.272]  And the evidence shows that Mr. Brown did not have the CD or the two grenades in his possession.
[00:04:13.793 --> 00:04:28.164]  They were planted by crooked agents working for a criminal state that has locked up and tortured scores of innocent men and women for a planned false flag event that they orchestrated with so many federal assets that they lost count.
[00:04:28.724 --> 00:04:39.415]  This criminal state is now threatening to go after everyone who was in Washington DC on January 6th, no matter if they were in the Capitol or on Capitol grounds.
[00:04:40.256 --> 00:04:50.366]  While we are still somewhat free, let us support Jeremy Brown in his legal efforts so that he can free himself and continue to fight for American freedom.
[00:04:51.287 --> 00:04:52.508]  Greg Reese reporting.
[00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:57.430]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're live.
[00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.670]  Thursday, January 18, 2024.
[00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.551]  Huge transmission lined up for you.
[00:05:01.591 --> 00:05:03.091]  Please stay with us.
[00:05:04.231 --> 00:05:04.692]  Wow!
[00:05:04.952 --> 00:05:08.873]  We have got an incredible transmission lined up for you today.
[00:05:09.293 --> 00:05:12.214]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown on World Events joins us in about 25 minutes.
[00:05:13.993 --> 00:05:22.638]  Jack Posobiec on giant military developments with NATO and as well as domestic political events will join us coming up the start of the next hour.
[00:05:22.658 --> 00:05:25.820]  Avi Yemini on top of the mountaintop there at Davos.
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.081]  We're getting incredible confrontations with the globalists.
[00:05:28.101 --> 00:05:28.861]  He'll be joining us.
[00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:31.243]  And then of course the great Drew Hernandez as well.
[00:05:31.583 --> 00:05:39.647]  There's going to be a jam-packed four hours on this live January 18, 2024 Thursday transmission.
[00:05:40.087 --> 00:05:40.448]  Okay.
[00:05:41.648 --> 00:05:42.549]  We've seen Germany.
[00:05:43.735 --> 00:05:53.862]  We've seen Sweden, we've seen the UK, we've seen all the documents and statements come out that they think war, full war with Russia is imminent, with no evidence of that.
[00:05:54.783 --> 00:05:57.225]  Now NATO prepares for Putin.
[00:05:57.605 --> 00:06:04.290]  90,000 troops are called up to the allegiance's largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War.
[00:06:05.911 --> 00:06:10.414]  The French government officially says war is good and will benefit the people and the economy.
[00:06:12.367 --> 00:06:15.370]  Ukraine on brink of a coup as Zelensky leads country to ruin.
[00:06:17.792 --> 00:06:24.438]  Speaker of the House throws cold water on Ukraine funding, prioritizing border security.
[00:06:25.179 --> 00:06:29.823]  So that's something good that the House Speaker is doing.
[00:06:31.905 --> 00:06:34.868]  And so much more on that front.
[00:06:36.516 --> 00:06:43.643]  Globalist panic as Trump vows to block central bank digital currencies, refused to give government absolute control over your money, and tyranny.
[00:06:44.784 --> 00:06:45.465]  Huge news.
[00:06:46.926 --> 00:06:53.813]  DHS secretly paid massive amounts of money to create counter propaganda against Trump and conservatives.
[00:06:54.354 --> 00:06:55.375]  Totally illegal.
[00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:56.316]  We're going to be getting to that.
[00:06:57.233 --> 00:07:09.880]  We've got all the big WEF developments with Argentina's new president Javier Mele slamming globalists on stage to their faces even more hardcore than what Elon Musk did last year.
[00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:14.403]  Elon Musk attacks the WEF quote overlords.
[00:07:15.344 --> 00:07:18.705]  Says how dare them try to take control of our society.
[00:07:20.426 --> 00:07:20.707]  U.S.
[00:07:20.767 --> 00:07:26.170]  News and World Report reports cancer exploding since the advent of the so-called COVID vaccine.
[00:07:27.776 --> 00:07:28.817]  There is so much more.
[00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:31.498]  California moves to ban football.
[00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:33.519]  Youth football.
[00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:35.320]  Total nanny state.
[00:07:36.761 --> 00:07:44.845]  Feds are now moving in as we speak, supposedly to displace state militia, the State National Guard, from Eagle Pass.
[00:07:44.865 --> 00:07:45.766]  We'll be tracking that.
[00:07:46.386 --> 00:07:47.247]  Also, it's beginning.
[00:07:47.307 --> 00:07:52.850]  Texas troopers beginning to arrest smugglers right in front of the feds.
[00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.492]  So, it's happening with state charges.
[00:07:57.779 --> 00:08:00.221]  So at least a little bit of a defense is starting to be put up.
[00:08:00.361 --> 00:08:06.205]  There is so much more we're going to be breaking down here today.
[00:08:07.366 --> 00:08:16.113]  But the first thing I wanted to hit just illustrates the panic, the raw hysteria out of the Democratic Party.
[00:08:17.013 --> 00:08:22.703]   This morning, the top of Drudge Report, It's just been taken off because it obviously blew up in their face.
[00:08:23.343 --> 00:08:26.284]  Was Trump has syphilis or does Trump have syphilis?
[00:08:26.985 --> 00:08:28.405]  We'll show you a screenshot of that in a moment.
[00:08:28.465 --> 00:08:42.891]  I shot a special report this morning that just went live on X. And the instant I looked at it, it's his right hand, it's his index finger, his thumb, and some of the pads on his, the top of the pad of his hand, the palm.
[00:08:44.321 --> 00:08:48.382]  I didn't play a lot of golf, but I've probably played 200, 300 rounds in my life.
[00:08:48.422 --> 00:08:50.702]  I was pretty good at it, but I never really had time to do it.
[00:08:50.742 --> 00:08:55.263]  I grew up on a golf course, and so I played from the time I was about 8 till I was about 16.
[00:08:55.343 --> 00:08:56.784]  Just got too busy with life.
[00:08:57.364 --> 00:08:59.504]  Too busy chasing girls, quite frankly, to want to play golf.
[00:08:59.544 --> 00:09:00.184]  It's a great sport.
[00:09:00.224 --> 00:09:01.385]  Love it.
[00:09:01.445 --> 00:09:02.845]  I think it's really good for people.
[00:09:02.925 --> 00:09:03.605]  It's enjoyable.
[00:09:04.405 --> 00:09:07.026]  It's just about individuals going out there and just enjoying nature.
[00:09:07.066 --> 00:09:11.627]  It's a way to forest bathe and be out in God's creation and kind of zone out.
[00:09:12.489 --> 00:09:14.391]  But Trump is a top scratch player.
[00:09:14.431 --> 00:09:16.013]  In many ways they say he's a professional.
[00:09:16.573 --> 00:09:18.335]  When he was a young man he could have been a professional.
[00:09:19.236 --> 00:09:31.790]  And so what the Democrats did, I found the actual photo, is they posturized it to make his hand look even whiter so that the bloody calluses on his hand, clearly from golfer's rash, would look like syphilis.
[00:09:34.608 --> 00:09:41.451]  If you go to any golf course and just walk up, a lot of the golfers are going to have tape on their hands, they're going to have body marks on their hands, especially if they're big golfers.
[00:09:42.051 --> 00:09:47.954]  Like Trump, who is known to play two 18 rounds a day sometimes, but almost every day, 18 holes.
[00:09:48.854 --> 00:09:56.258]  So that's a classic golfer's rash, and they're trying to make that the big story because they have nothing.
[00:09:56.558 --> 00:10:01.400]  Because, rigged court saying he raped women with no evidence.
[00:10:02.861 --> 00:10:04.803]  And then he's found guilty for saying he's innocent.
[00:10:05.543 --> 00:10:08.706]  And the other kangaroo courts with no juries in New York and the rest of it.
[00:10:09.446 --> 00:10:15.751]  And Fannie Willis and what's happening in Georgia, it's discovered that she's a complete and total criminal as we broke months ago.
[00:10:18.494 --> 00:10:19.254]  None of it's working.
[00:10:19.374 --> 00:10:21.456]  So now they're moving to total desperation.
[00:10:21.476 --> 00:10:25.199]  A few weeks ago, it was that Trump was pooping his pants.
[00:10:25.299 --> 00:10:26.560]  Now that's Joe Biden.
[00:10:27.221 --> 00:10:29.122]  Now it's that he's got syphilis.
[00:10:29.162 --> 00:10:31.304]  Just incredible desperation here it is.
[00:10:33.132 --> 00:10:39.940]  If you go to the Drudge Report, and I think it'll still be up, there's a story that talks about Trump having hand cuts.
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.421]  And you can link to it.
[00:10:41.602 --> 00:10:43.444]  They don't look like cuts to me.
[00:10:43.464 --> 00:10:45.326]  They look like sores.
[00:10:46.429 --> 00:10:55.914]  And I've asked a number of MDs what medical condition manifests itself through hand sores, and the answer is immediate and unanimous.
[00:10:56.434 --> 00:10:57.615]  Secondary syphilis.
[00:10:58.315 --> 00:10:58.616]  All right?
[00:10:58.716 --> 00:11:01.537]  I think there's a good chance this man has the clap.
[00:11:02.137 --> 00:11:04.639]  And I'm not being particularly secretive about it.
[00:11:05.339 --> 00:11:07.480]  I am texting the photo.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.601]  You can link to it.
[00:11:08.641 --> 00:11:11.162]  It's in some operation called the Daily Mail.
[00:11:11.242 --> 00:11:11.983]  It's some British thing.
[00:11:12.023 --> 00:11:14.284]  It's probably a Fleet Street rag.
[00:11:15.262 --> 00:11:21.026]  You know, maybe the picture was doctored or whatever, but maybe this story will go somewhere and maybe it won't.
[00:11:21.106 --> 00:11:26.389]  But I'm telling you at one o'clock Eastern, I'm humping this thing like a young dog on old furniture.
[00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:28.711]  Golfers vasculitis.
[00:11:29.331 --> 00:11:30.672]  That's what Trump has.
[00:11:31.793 --> 00:11:38.957]  And we see desperate Democrat Party operative James Carville putting out videos and Drudge Report and others picking it up.
[00:11:39.237 --> 00:11:40.698]  Does Trump have syphilis?
[00:11:41.239 --> 00:11:47.559]   The instant I saw his hand, where it's worn, where you hold the club, and where the index
[00:11:47.559 --> 00:11:53.519]   finger grips it, and the thumb, is what I grew up witnessing when I played golf.
[00:11:53.519 --> 00:11:55.598]  I quit playing golf by the time I was 16.
[00:11:55.598 --> 00:11:57.158]  I had other stuff to do.
[00:11:57.158 --> 00:11:59.118]  But I would routinely get it.
[00:11:59.118 --> 00:12:02.038]   If you were around a golf course, walk up there and talk to golfers.
[00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:06.578]  Out of 10 of them, 2 or 3 will have tape on their fingers, on their thumbs, and you'll ask, what's wrong?
[00:12:06.598 --> 00:12:08.580]  They'll say, I've got golfer's rash.
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:19.007]  So you can see it's perfect golfer's rash, the way you hold it, and the stroke when you come in puts a lot of pressure on the index finger, and on the thumb, and right here.
[00:12:19.427 --> 00:12:20.788]  He has golfer's rash.
[00:12:20.828 --> 00:12:25.792]  The man plays up to 2 complete 18 rounds a day.
[00:12:26.676 --> 00:12:27.297]  Do that twice.
[00:12:27.677 --> 00:12:30.620]  He is a top scratch golfer, almost professional.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.422]  And this isn't about even defending Trump.
[00:12:32.442 --> 00:12:34.704]  It's about defending reality.
[00:12:34.724 --> 00:12:35.705]  And I am sick of it.
[00:12:35.745 --> 00:12:37.707]  These people are so desperate.
[00:12:38.388 --> 00:12:45.155]  They've got all these kangaroo courts, rigged events, trials without juries, all the indictments.
[00:12:45.756 --> 00:12:46.737]  He's a Russian spy.
[00:12:46.817 --> 00:12:47.778]  Women are peeing on him.
[00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:51.678]  None of it's true, ladies and gentlemen, and none of the things they've said about me are true, either.
[00:12:51.998 --> 00:12:56.161]  They're a lying pack of scum, and Carville has no shame.
[00:12:56.641 --> 00:12:58.522]  President Trump is a golfer.
[00:12:58.922 --> 00:13:00.523]  It's his golfing hand.
[00:13:01.003 --> 00:13:03.165]  The one that grips down the furthest is the right hand.
[00:13:03.585 --> 00:13:04.926]  That's where you tend to get it.
[00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:06.207]  Everybody knows it.
[00:13:06.447 --> 00:13:08.288]  He doesn't have syphilis.
[00:13:09.629 --> 00:13:11.770]  All right, I'll be covering this live today at 11 a.m.
[00:13:11.589 --> 00:13:31.389]   I am centralinfowars.com/show and follow me @realalexjones here on X.
[00:13:31.701 --> 00:13:35.886]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[00:13:38.516 --> 00:13:43.379]  And a lot of viewers watching on TV, we're on a lot of talk radio stations as well, so we have a lot of links and URLs up there.
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:48.723]  That's because for the last five years we've been banned everywhere but Infowars.com and radio and TV stations.
[00:13:49.564 --> 00:13:50.585]  And through your word of mouth.
[00:13:50.625 --> 00:14:04.995]  But now that we're back on X and so many other places are now being flooded with our information, people watching need to know, hey, come to The Source and see the full live show and the other great broadcast of Owen Schroyer and Harrison Smith and Chase Geyser and the rest of the crew.
[00:14:05.635 --> 00:14:07.577]  That info wars.com forward slash show.
[00:14:08.078 --> 00:14:12.782]  But Democrats, there's the tweet on X. Democrats are beyond desperate.
[00:14:13.483 --> 00:14:15.145]  Cause of Trump's hand rash discovered.
[00:14:15.225 --> 00:14:16.546]  It's not syphilis.
[00:14:17.327 --> 00:14:20.250]  And you can say, well, why are we even fighting back against these lies?
[00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:23.593]  Because it shows that they are a pack of liars.
[00:14:23.633 --> 00:14:26.136]  Now, let's talk about why they're so angry at Trump.
[00:14:28.171 --> 00:14:36.655]  He cares about sovereignty and independence and doesn't want the globalists taking control of our country, whether it's the UN treaties or the central bank digital currencies.
[00:14:37.215 --> 00:14:43.778]  And he has said that he will stop any central bank digital currency being deployed in the United States.
[00:14:43.798 --> 00:14:50.700]  Well, that's good because the Federal Reserve is rolling it out in June here in the United States.
[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:52.481]  The EU has already rolled it out.
[00:14:52.921 --> 00:14:56.083]  Communist China has had it for five years.
[00:14:57.245 --> 00:15:07.875]  Also, since everybody's obsessed with scratches or cuts on political figures, I was cleaning out the garage yesterday and getting down some of the BB guns that are all dusty and dirty and some of the little metal targets.
[00:15:08.295 --> 00:15:12.739]  My daughter wants to shoot some BB guns again and forgot that a rock hammer was up on the top shelf.
[00:15:13.039 --> 00:15:14.220]  So when I pulled the BB guns down...
[00:15:15.202 --> 00:15:25.929]  Boom, got hit in the head with a rock hammer, didn't do much of a bruise, turned my head quickly into some boxes, and got a paper cut there on the edge of a box on my face.
[00:15:25.989 --> 00:15:28.711]  Not a cat scratch, not a vampire bite.
[00:15:29.552 --> 00:15:36.736]  That is what happens when you hurriedly throw a rock hammer, which my six and a half year old daughter and other children also love.
[00:15:37.097 --> 00:15:39.078]  We like to go into the creek beds and things.
[00:15:39.218 --> 00:15:42.821]  She's got a little rock hammer, I've got a big one, and we find these amazing fossils.
[00:15:43.741 --> 00:15:46.062]  And that's what happened, but that's a side issue.
[00:15:46.122 --> 00:15:48.242]  It's not syphilis either, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:48.282 --> 00:15:50.383]  It's a rock hammer hitting me in the head.
[00:15:50.403 --> 00:15:53.323]  I was like, what the hell is that?
[00:15:53.343 --> 00:15:53.963]  It's like a cartoon.
[00:15:53.983 --> 00:15:54.944]  It's like, oh, it's a hammer.
[00:15:55.424 --> 00:16:00.385]  All the things that stick up on top of a shelf and then pull down the BB guns that were inside cases.
[00:16:01.205 --> 00:16:01.525]  Crazy.
[00:16:02.425 --> 00:16:03.606]  But I am digressing.
[00:16:04.406 --> 00:16:09.467]  Here is Trump yesterday talking about how he will stand against the central bank digital currency.
[00:16:11.698 --> 00:16:16.302]  And tonight I'm also making another promise to protect Americans from government tyranny.
[00:16:16.403 --> 00:16:21.848]  As your president, I will never allow the creation of a central bank digital currency.
[00:16:21.868 --> 00:16:22.528]  You know about that?
[00:16:26.132 --> 00:16:32.177]  Here's another clip from the same speech where he talks about how they're engaged in disinformation and misinformation.
[00:16:32.197 --> 00:16:32.538]  Here it is.
[00:16:33.814 --> 00:16:40.359]  The radical left Democrats are supporting Nikki Haley because they know she's much easier to beat than Trump.
[00:16:40.639 --> 00:16:41.220]  And you know what?
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.041]  If she weren't, they wouldn't be doing it.
[00:16:43.381 --> 00:16:45.403]  But, you know, they're great disinformation people.
[00:16:45.483 --> 00:16:47.764]  Misinformation, disinformation.
[00:16:47.805 --> 00:16:49.606]  You know, they're almost the same, but not quite.
[00:16:50.166 --> 00:16:52.188]  But let's not go into definitions right now.
[00:16:52.748 --> 00:16:53.869]  They're very close, actually.
[00:16:53.889 --> 00:16:57.452]  A lot of people still don't understand it, but I give them credit for both.
[00:16:58.032 --> 00:16:58.593]  But they are.
[00:16:58.673 --> 00:17:01.215]  They are literally what they're doing is they're.
[00:17:01.795 --> 00:17:05.377]  They will say, we want to run against Trump so bad.
[00:17:05.417 --> 00:17:08.079]  In the meantime, they're sending all their people to vote for Nikki Haley.
[00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:11.321]  The reason they do that is they want to run against Nikki Haley.
[00:17:11.822 --> 00:17:14.544]  Usually, when they say something, it's the opposite, okay?
[00:17:15.184 --> 00:17:16.345]  And they're very good at it, too.
[00:17:16.385 --> 00:17:18.586]  They're good at cheating in elections and disinformation.
[00:17:19.647 --> 00:17:20.508]  Absolutely, they are.
[00:17:20.648 --> 00:17:22.609]  And they're getting caught, and people know the scam now.
[00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:25.591]  Now, before I get into all the other news, there's a lot today.
[00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:26.732]  We're going to get to all of it here.
[00:17:27.552 --> 00:17:29.794]  I want to talk about our enemy.
[00:17:31.306 --> 00:17:35.849]  And I think what I should do next is, in fact, I'm going to probably do this today, and I'll air it tomorrow.
[00:17:36.509 --> 00:17:43.814]  I'm going to put a compilation together of world leaders calling for bringing the world population down to 500 million, or even lower.
[00:17:44.715 --> 00:17:52.380]  I mean, I've got King Charles saying, and I've got Gene Goodall saying, and I've got Klaus Schwab saying, and I've got Bill Gates saying, and I've got them all saying it.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:58.684]  But there's a new one here that I thought we would play that's from Rebel News.
[00:17:58.704 --> 00:17:59.644]  This is going on at Davos.
[00:17:59.664 --> 00:18:00.385]  This happened yesterday.
[00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:07.153]  Watch the most ridiculous 75 seconds of BS from a Davos, yet on Echo's side.
[00:18:08.453 --> 00:18:26.045]   And this lady we're about to play, looks like she's never missed a meal in her life, explains with no sense of irony or shame, while she's in a luxury compound pulling in a private jet, that farming the land, fishing for food, and worse, still making money, It's war, it's feudalism, it's siege.
[00:18:25.884 --> 00:18:29.504]  murder and genocide we want to put the farmers in jail.
[00:18:29.504 --> 00:18:34.733]   That's Jojo Mehta, founder of Stop Echocide Now, explains in her upper-class English
[00:18:34.733 --> 00:18:40.345]   accent to her ultra-rich peers at the Dabos Group. It's war, it's feudalism,
[00:18:40.345 --> 00:18:44.354]   it's siege, cutting off your resources, cutting off the fertilizer of the
[00:18:44.354 --> 00:18:49.564]   plants that we then eat, and that the animals that we eat eat.
[00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:49.371]  Cutting off the pipelines.
[00:18:49.411 --> 00:18:50.412]  Cutting it all off, folks.
[00:18:50.432 --> 00:18:51.392]  They're at war.
[00:18:51.853 --> 00:18:56.136]  So just play her back-to-back, and then let's just throw one rich globalist in.
[00:18:56.476 --> 00:18:59.638]  Jane Goodall saying, reduce the population to below 500 million.
[00:19:00.018 --> 00:19:02.620]  That's 7.5 million people they want to say go bye-bye.
[00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.382]  And with a straight face, they're saying, arrest the farmers.
[00:19:05.722 --> 00:19:10.485]  And they already cut off like, what, 20-30% of the farming in just the last year in the Netherlands.
[00:19:11.226 --> 00:19:14.268]  Sri Lanka's gone into martial law because of it after a decade of doing it.
[00:19:14.608 --> 00:19:15.809]  I mean, these people are sick.
[00:19:16.813 --> 00:19:18.586]  They're literally cutting off the resources.
[00:19:18.807 --> 00:19:19.291]  Here she is.
[00:19:20.333 --> 00:19:28.578]  I mean, ecocide, as a word, is becoming better known around the world, and the concept is generally mass damage and destruction of nature.
[00:19:29.379 --> 00:19:37.665]  But legally speaking, what our organization and other collaborators aim to do is to have this recognized legally as a serious crime.
[00:19:37.685 --> 00:19:49.973]  Because one of the issues that sort of pervades all of this discussion is that we have a kind of cultural, very ingrained habit of not taking damage to nature as seriously as we take damage to people and property.
[00:19:50.773 --> 00:19:56.819]  I mean, if you're campaigning for human rights, at least you know mass murder, torture, all of these things are serious crimes.
[00:19:57.359 --> 00:19:59.741]  But there's no equivalent in the environmental space.
[00:20:00.782 --> 00:20:15.750]   And so, unlike an international crime like genocide that involves a specific intent, with ecocide what we see is actually what people are trying to do, what businesses are trying to do is make money, is farm, is
[00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:22.821]   fish, is do all of these things that are producing energy and so on as well. But what's
[00:20:22.821 --> 00:20:28.701]   missing is the awareness and the conscience around the side effects, around the collateral
[00:20:28.701 --> 00:20:30.431]  damage that happens with that.
[00:20:30.431 --> 00:20:36.790]   We need to eat less meat. We need to stop land being used for cattle and growing grain
[00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:41.191]   for the billions of animals that we keep in our intensive farms.
[00:20:41.388 --> 00:20:47.213]  And then finally, we cannot hide away from human population growth.
[00:20:47.934 --> 00:20:51.216]  Because, you know, it underlies so many of the other problems.
[00:20:51.256 --> 00:20:59.043]  All these things we talk about wouldn't be a problem if there was the size of population that there was 500 years ago.
[00:20:59.063 --> 00:21:01.685]  Which was 450 million people.
[00:21:02.485 --> 00:21:09.191]   So, The most dirty technologies are the electric cars, the lithium mines, the cobalt mines.
[00:21:09.511 --> 00:21:12.393]  There you see literal slaves mining it for the big U.N.
[00:21:12.413 --> 00:21:12.993]  controlled companies.
[00:21:13.413 --> 00:21:14.514]  But that's all okay.
[00:21:14.894 --> 00:21:18.436]  But an evil farmer, you can type in the headline, W.E.F.
[00:21:18.476 --> 00:21:20.717]  says organic farming needs to be outlawed.
[00:21:20.797 --> 00:21:21.817]  Organic farming is the worst.
[00:21:22.758 --> 00:21:24.039]  Total crap!
[00:21:24.099 --> 00:21:25.279]  They want to shut everything down.
[00:21:25.299 --> 00:21:28.561]  They have giant factory farms and slave labor.
[00:21:28.581 --> 00:21:32.563]  These people are beyond monsters and they're out in the open.
[00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:36.833]  And Javier Mele, people said, what's he doing at Davos?
[00:21:36.853 --> 00:21:39.515]  Well, Trump went there to laugh in their face and destroy them.
[00:21:39.555 --> 00:21:40.036]  So did he.
[00:21:40.917 --> 00:21:49.224]  He came out and said, we're here to tell you that collectivist experiments are never the solution to the problems that affect the citizens of the world.
[00:21:49.284 --> 00:21:50.825]  Rather, they are the root cause.
[00:21:51.386 --> 00:21:59.493]  He went on to say that the left is in destroying the world and that collectivists are destroying the world and that elites funding it are the enemy.
[00:22:00.771 --> 00:22:03.374]  And are the main danger to the planet.
[00:22:04.716 --> 00:22:15.849]  And in that danger, because those who are supposed to have to defend the values of the West are co-opted by a vision of the world that inexorably leads to socialism and thereby poverty.
[00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:18.412]  And he goes on to indict them.
[00:22:19.724 --> 00:22:21.444]  The pro-Trump populist leader.
[00:22:22.165 --> 00:22:23.205]  People say, oh, he's one of them.
[00:22:23.245 --> 00:22:23.605]  He's there.
[00:22:23.945 --> 00:22:27.986]  He's there laughing at them, laughing at Klaus Schwab when he introduced him.
[00:22:28.586 --> 00:22:36.428]  Klaus Schwab is deathly afraid of all this and is simply trying to co-opt everybody into their globalist order that is dead on arrival.
[00:22:36.928 --> 00:22:48.811]  And coming up, Pastor Rodney Howard Brown, one of the greatest pastors out there that 25 years ago envisioned that there would be a great reset and a great awakening and that we would be in this time.
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:53.803]  Has traveled over 100 countries and has missions in dozens of countries.
[00:22:53.843 --> 00:22:56.224]  He can tell you what's really happening in the world.
[00:22:56.244 --> 00:22:58.586]  We're going to get his insights coming up.
[00:22:59.086 --> 00:23:04.470]  And then, Jack Posobiec, one of the best military political analysts out there.
[00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:05.430]  This guy's dead on.
[00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:06.891]  Joins us in the second hour.
[00:23:07.832 --> 00:23:16.278]  In the third hour, Avi Amini, great rebel news reporter on the mountaintop with more confrontations with globalists coming in as we speak.
[00:23:17.574 --> 00:23:19.316]  Coming up with Jack Posobiec, breaking.
[00:23:19.376 --> 00:23:25.241]  NATO to launch largest drills in decades with some 90,000 troops preparing for war with Russia.
[00:23:25.782 --> 00:23:31.307]  We've got all these leaked documents of the German government and others saying they believe war is imminent.
[00:23:31.508 --> 00:23:34.711]  Absolute, total and complete insanity.
[00:23:34.891 --> 00:23:35.231]  All right.
[00:23:36.212 --> 00:23:39.555]  We're going to go to break here in a few minutes and come back with the great Rodney Howard Brown.
[00:23:40.598 --> 00:23:46.803]  And his wonderful River Church there in Tampa, Florida, and his international TV and radio programs.
[00:23:47.644 --> 00:23:48.744]  Before we do, go to break.
[00:23:48.905 --> 00:23:52.147]  Remember, I'm not funded by George Soros or The Globalist.
[00:23:52.187 --> 00:23:52.988]  I'm funded by you.

[00:25:08.151 --> 00:25:12.278]  But I have to pay half the bills of free speech system and I don't have the money.
[00:25:12.738 --> 00:25:14.121]  And he's not reversed his ruling.
[00:25:14.561 --> 00:25:15.723]  So that's the cheek in our armor.

[00:25:25.568 --> 00:25:27.949]  If you're on the fence, please keep us on the air.
[00:25:28.289 --> 00:25:34.953]  There's not any operation that you can fund that is more in the face of the globe, unless it's having a bigger effect on air and off air.
[00:25:35.213 --> 00:25:46.959]  We've got the ear of Trump, the ear of Joe Rogan, the ear of Elon Musk, the ear of Tucker Carlson, and quite frankly, I'll just be honest with you, all glory goes to God, I'm as effective behind the scenes as I am on air.
[00:25:47.099 --> 00:25:57.089]   I spend probably an hour a day Sending those gentlemen and other people and other prominent folks information, documents, and reports.
[00:25:58.150 --> 00:25:58.490]  Okay?
[00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:02.831]  And that's what this is all about.
[00:26:02.971 --> 00:26:05.172]  So we are battling at the grassroots.
[00:26:05.192 --> 00:26:07.292]  We're battling at the very heights of the political order.
[00:26:07.692 --> 00:26:16.355]  We have a good chance of really backing down the New World Order and I think getting a Nineveh-type reprieve like Jonah got for Nineveh for a hundred years.
[00:26:16.735 --> 00:26:20.119]  If God's going to let the Antichrist come in soon and all that happens, then that's God's will.
[00:26:20.379 --> 00:26:26.125]  But it's our job to occupy the land and to warn the people, and I can't do it without your support.
[00:26:26.145 --> 00:26:28.348]  So please, go to InfoWarshaw.com.

[00:26:32.272 --> 00:26:33.473]  That's what the judge ruled.
[00:26:33.893 --> 00:26:34.094]  Show!

[00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:22.633]  You know, I stood up here and I yell and scream about the New World Order and the globalists.
[00:27:22.653 --> 00:27:26.757]  They're planning to get rid of the borders and release a virus and have a global power grab.
[00:27:26.797 --> 00:27:27.838]  And you saw it all come true.
[00:27:28.959 --> 00:27:31.589]   But there's a Inverse of that.

[00:28:17.661 --> 00:28:25.008]   Well, he was the first major preacher who's on in hundreds of Countries around the world.
[00:28:25.028 --> 00:28:27.690]  Has a mega church there in Tampa, Florida.
[00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:28.930]  Ministries all over the planet.
[00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:32.591]  He was the first preacher to get arrested during the COVID lockdowns.
[00:28:33.152 --> 00:28:37.813]  And he caused a chain reaction of other pastors around the world.
[00:28:37.853 --> 00:28:41.215]  He was right about the death shot going back when they first started pushing it.
[00:28:41.855 --> 00:28:42.796]  Four years ago.
[00:28:42.856 --> 00:28:44.418]  I really, I want to say he's my pastor.
[00:28:44.919 --> 00:28:48.462]  Rodney Howard Brown at Revival.com.
[00:28:48.482 --> 00:28:51.205]  Revival, just like it sounds, dot com.
[00:28:51.926 --> 00:28:53.948]  And I wanted to get him to pop in today.
[00:28:54.289 --> 00:28:55.430]  Only got 30 minutes with him.
[00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:57.512]  Jack Posobiec coming up after that.
[00:28:57.792 --> 00:29:01.332]   And obviously I wanted to get him on about Trump, what he sees happening.
[00:29:01.332 --> 00:29:03.752]  He predicted Trump would win back when nobody else was.
[00:29:03.752 --> 00:29:06.311]  Of course we were, but most people weren't.
[00:29:06.311 --> 00:29:09.592]   And so I want to get his view on the persecution of Trump and what we as Christians should
[00:29:09.592 --> 00:29:10.592]  be doing.
[00:29:10.592 --> 00:29:14.432]   And then he's always got other great research and things that need to be talked about.
[00:29:14.432 --> 00:29:19.752]   He brought up one of the additives they're putting into geoengineering, deuterium, very
[00:29:19.752 --> 00:29:21.952]  poisonous, very deadly.
[00:29:21.952 --> 00:29:25.712]   And what this large depopulation plan is, is they attack the farming and more.
[00:29:25.712 --> 00:29:27.072]  So we'll talk about deuterium.
[00:29:27.072 --> 00:29:31.272]   So he got back recently from visiting a whole bunch of countries in Africa.
[00:29:31.272 --> 00:29:34.592]   I'll give you a report about the mass awakening happening there.
[00:29:34.592 --> 00:29:35.592]  So revival.com.
[00:29:35.592 --> 00:29:36.992]  Pastor Brown, great to see you.
[00:29:36.992 --> 00:29:46.992]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:29:38.069 --> 00:29:39.810]  Hey Alex, I love your opening.
[00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:42.851]  That's the theme from Airwolf, I believe it is.
[00:29:42.891 --> 00:29:43.112]  Yes.
[00:29:43.312 --> 00:29:46.733]  I always feel like we're coming in on a tech on The Globalist right now.
[00:29:47.134 --> 00:29:50.675]  I could just see us flying in and taking out the W-E-F.
[00:29:50.955 --> 00:29:55.318]  Anyway, good to see you.
[00:29:56.318 --> 00:29:56.938]  Good to see you.
[00:29:57.119 --> 00:30:01.861]  Well, let's plunge into, because you were telling me great stuff during the break, but I said, hold on, repeat that for the audience.
[00:30:02.161 --> 00:30:03.762]  Trump, the moment we're in in history right now.
[00:30:04.884 --> 00:30:16.009]  All right, so obviously the landslide that took place up in New Hampshire, Iowa, sorry, the landslide.
[00:30:16.109 --> 00:30:19.630]  And I mean, I see they flipped stuff right at the last minute for Haley.
[00:30:20.291 --> 00:30:23.612]  These were all counties that were for Biden at the last minute.
[00:30:24.224 --> 00:30:29.506]  I was actually watching, and I actually tuned into CNN, just because I wanted to see their reaction.
[00:30:30.107 --> 00:30:32.388]  And it was, they were such liars.
[00:30:32.488 --> 00:30:39.130]  So, you could see they were filming a county, which Trump actually won.
[00:30:39.431 --> 00:30:47.474]  They were filming one of the caucuses, which Trump lost that one, but the other two balanced out and he won that whole county.
[00:30:48.112 --> 00:30:51.134]  And they were saying, look how honest the election is.
[00:30:51.454 --> 00:30:52.735]  Each ballot is counted.
[00:30:52.995 --> 00:30:55.057]  This is what happened in Philadelphia.
[00:30:55.097 --> 00:30:57.118]  This is what happened in Pennsylvania and Arizona.
[00:30:57.458 --> 00:30:59.100]  And I'm just sitting there shaking my head.
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.342]  No, this is not what happened there.
[00:31:02.722 --> 00:31:04.223]  But anyway, so here he is.
[00:31:04.303 --> 00:31:05.584]  He wins every county.
[00:31:05.724 --> 00:31:06.945]  I know they flipped the last three.
[00:31:07.045 --> 00:31:08.066]  I don't even count that.
[00:31:08.166 --> 00:31:10.928]  I count what was announced on the night.
[00:31:11.928 --> 00:31:16.231]  I mean, even the fact that CNN called it after 30 minutes, they knew it was going to be a landslide.
[00:31:18.214 --> 00:31:20.576]  So, here he is, he's back.
[00:31:20.676 --> 00:31:21.798]  People are mad.
[00:31:21.838 --> 00:31:30.106]  The leftists are very upset because they've thrown everything at him, including the kitchen sink, and he just keeps going up in popularity.
[00:31:30.646 --> 00:31:35.211]  And I know everybody's watching, well, how can you even vote for somebody like that?
[00:31:35.271 --> 00:31:36.692]  He's a this, he's a this.
[00:31:37.092 --> 00:31:38.374]  None of that stuff is proven.
[00:31:38.614 --> 00:31:39.715]  All of that stuff's lies.
[00:31:40.275 --> 00:31:45.182]   All of these court cases are just banana courts run by a bunch of
[00:31:45.182 --> 00:31:51.961]   Sovereign paid operatives and they just don't want him in and you can see already in the UK
[00:31:51.961 --> 00:31:56.471]   They're saying this is gonna be national security Other places are saying the same thing because they know
[00:31:56.471 --> 00:32:00.781]   Trump's gonna come after them And of course he is for America first
[00:32:00.781 --> 00:32:06.861]   He believes in America as as as a country which we you could see
[00:32:06.861 --> 00:32:11.582]   I'm obviously, you know better than most people the open borders of what they're doing right now
[00:32:12.182 --> 00:32:19.581]   military age people that are flooding our borders and Basically trying to dilute America set up new redistricting
[00:32:19.581 --> 00:32:25.458]   with a new voting and everybody voting for The money that's coming.
[00:32:25.498 --> 00:32:36.848]  I was talking to a pastor in Germany and she was telling me they have several companies and she said it's very hard to hire people right now, she said, because they just called a doctor saying we don't feel this well.
[00:32:37.449 --> 00:32:40.752]  And so when they do that, the doctor said, well, how many days do you want off?
[00:32:40.792 --> 00:32:42.853]  They said, well, we think we'll take 10 days off.
[00:32:43.474 --> 00:32:48.879]  And so they take 10 days off and she said it's hard to find anybody doing any work.
[00:32:49.563 --> 00:32:59.069]  And she said they also did a census now on the houses to see how many people are living in your house so they can make you take in illegals.
[00:32:59.509 --> 00:33:01.971]  So obviously you see that happening up in Massachusetts.
[00:33:01.991 --> 00:33:03.412]  They're doing the exact same thing there.
[00:33:04.089 --> 00:33:07.049]  and this ridiculous stuff that's going on.
[00:33:07.049 --> 00:33:11.848]   So Trump is the only one out of everybody that can actually bring a stop to this.
[00:33:11.848 --> 00:33:19.649]   And I'm just concerned about something that maybe he hasn't learned his lesson
[00:33:19.649 --> 00:33:22.288]  because he was surrounded by deep state.
[00:33:22.288 --> 00:33:28.928]   We found out now that Mike Pence was the leaker to the press of everything happening inside the Oval Office.
[00:33:29.129 --> 00:33:33.632]  So when everybody said Trump's doing this, Trump's mad about this, it was Mike Pence that was spilling the beans.
[00:33:34.152 --> 00:33:40.376]  So I see the same kind of people surrounding him right now, which I'm very concerned about, very concerned about.
[00:33:40.917 --> 00:33:41.077]  So...
[00:33:43.201 --> 00:33:45.062]  That he's going to win, there's no doubt.
[00:33:45.503 --> 00:33:51.787]  For them to take him out, obviously they're going to have to try to arrest him, put him in prison, but even then he's going to get stronger.
[00:33:52.127 --> 00:33:53.088]  So I believe he's going to win.
[00:33:53.348 --> 00:33:54.849]  I don't think there's a question about it.
[00:33:55.129 --> 00:34:12.782]   There's nobody voting for Biden unless they bring Michelle Obama and try to flip everything at the last minute and create a problem and cause You know, with the X-virus now, the new X-virus, trying to get everything back to manly ballots.
[00:34:13.222 --> 00:34:17.826]  But still then, I can't see them carrying this next election.
[00:34:17.886 --> 00:34:18.847]  I don't care what they do.
[00:34:19.247 --> 00:34:22.750]  I think even some of the most liberal people are done now.
[00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:24.111]  They're done with Biden.
[00:34:24.131 --> 00:34:29.996]  They're done with all the nonsense and the lies and the gaslighting, basically.
[00:34:30.156 --> 00:34:32.058]  Oh, everything's great, the economy's great, whatever.
[00:34:32.338 --> 00:34:33.779]  And people are saying, no, it's not.
[00:34:34.392 --> 00:34:37.235]  So they're not buying the Emperor's new clothes.
[00:34:37.415 --> 00:34:38.837]  They've seen through all of this stuff.
[00:34:38.857 --> 00:34:40.518]  So I think Trump's gonna win.
[00:34:40.979 --> 00:34:42.540]  That's the way I'm looking at it right now.
[00:34:42.921 --> 00:34:48.366]  I'm concerned that even if he does win, that once again he's surrounded by a bunch of clowns.
[00:34:48.927 --> 00:34:50.468]  I'm very concerned about that.
[00:34:50.588 --> 00:34:52.170]  That's like a thing that irritates me.
[00:34:52.650 --> 00:35:10.754]   If I was him, I would pick Dr. Ben Carson to be the vice president the reason I would he's a medical doctor number one He's been loyal to Trump from from right throughout his tenure And then also the fact that if if Trump wins, they're gonna go to race rights.
[00:35:11.094 --> 00:35:15.297]  So we need someone like dr Carson who can stand in the gap.
[00:35:15.317 --> 00:35:21.781]  So this is my take on it I'm not saying it's a hundred percent, but I just feel I'm concerned about him.
[00:35:21.821 --> 00:35:28.705]   I think we need to pray The whole of America is dependent upon Really, what takes place now in November.
[00:35:30.145 --> 00:35:34.006]  Not that we can turn everything around, but it'll be a stay of execution.
[00:35:34.466 --> 00:35:48.130]  Ultimately, we have to see the stuff that's coming out of Davos this week put to an end as far as all of their plans for population reduction, eugenics, and just everything.
[00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:48.730]  The wars.
[00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:51.111]  They want this war so bad with Iran.
[00:35:51.815 --> 00:35:59.261]  Because it'll keep Netanyahu in power, it'll keep the Mueller's in power, it'll keep all the criminals will stay in power based on this war.
[00:35:59.301 --> 00:36:03.284]  So Trump's the only one that will be able to say, no, we're not doing it.
[00:36:04.685 --> 00:36:05.806]  They don't like his rhetoric.
[00:36:05.886 --> 00:36:07.387]  They don't like the way that he talks.
[00:36:07.747 --> 00:36:11.610]  I love the way he talks, because somebody needs to say, I was laughing.
[00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:13.932]  I was laughing at the Iowa election.
[00:36:14.312 --> 00:36:19.756]  So he tells everybody, everybody needs to vote, even if you're sick, to say, honey, we gotta go.
[00:36:20.256 --> 00:36:26.069]   Even if I die, In me going out right now, at least I'm dying for the cause of America.
[00:36:26.509 --> 00:36:27.350]  And that's just Trump.
[00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:28.731]  You know, he says it like it is.
[00:36:29.271 --> 00:36:30.132]  People didn't like it.
[00:36:30.833 --> 00:36:39.399]  Obviously, he and I, we're not in agreement with what happened with COVID and Dr. Fauci and Berks and all that kind of stuff.
[00:36:39.439 --> 00:36:43.081]  But, look, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt on all of that stuff.
[00:36:43.462 --> 00:36:49.446]  The bottom line is, in the lineup of everybody running, I mean, I can tell you about Vivek.
[00:36:49.986 --> 00:36:50.707]  He's a saurus.
[00:36:51.502 --> 00:36:54.844]  Created a guy coming out of the World Economic Forum.
[00:36:55.024 --> 00:36:56.345]  He has companies in China.
[00:36:57.245 --> 00:36:58.546]  He's done a deal with Pfizer.
[00:36:58.826 --> 00:37:01.007]  Listen, I mean, you just have to dig a little bit.
[00:37:01.127 --> 00:37:02.408]  He's a Goldman Sachs guy.
[00:37:02.908 --> 00:37:06.250]  I like his talk, but I don't trust him at all.
[00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:07.171]  I don't.
[00:37:07.591 --> 00:37:08.111]  I just don't.
[00:37:08.731 --> 00:37:10.412]  Sorry, Vivek, if you do get to see this.
[00:37:10.832 --> 00:37:11.913]  I just don't trust you.
[00:37:12.854 --> 00:37:15.175]  I saw your lines with the same lines as Obama.
[00:37:15.295 --> 00:37:20.858]  Obama's talking about, you know, when he was running and you used the exact same speech.
[00:37:22.765 --> 00:37:25.527]  It's like Hillary and Biden using the exact same speech.
[00:37:25.567 --> 00:37:26.067]  Absolutely.
[00:37:26.087 --> 00:37:27.689]  He's definitely got his homework, all those things.
[00:37:27.869 --> 00:37:30.411]  So shifting out of that, you mentioned race riots.
[00:37:31.252 --> 00:37:36.015]  The Democrat Party, the CIA, the former defense heads have all said Trump is going to be a dictator.
[00:37:36.035 --> 00:37:41.520]  We've got to have Congress strip the power of the military preemptively away from Trump if he wins.
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:43.601]  And Senator Blumenthal is introducing a bill.
[00:37:43.861 --> 00:37:47.604]  They say if Black Lives Matter is protesting, he's not allowed to stop it.
[00:37:47.885 --> 00:37:50.447]  So they're trying to legalize a communist revolution.
[00:37:51.087 --> 00:37:53.168]  And guarantee it can't be opposed.
[00:37:53.209 --> 00:38:02.335]  It's like all these cities, dozens of them, that gave 10, 20, 30, 40 million dollars apiece to Black Lives Matter and apologized that a few police tried to stop them burning cities down.
[00:38:02.795 --> 00:38:03.976]  Clearly that's their go-to.
[00:38:04.016 --> 00:38:05.957]  So how do you see the election playing out?
[00:38:05.977 --> 00:38:06.998]  A dead reckoning?
[00:38:07.578 --> 00:38:08.619]  What's the Holy Spirit tell you?
[00:38:08.659 --> 00:38:12.421]  And if Trump gets in, which I think he will, then they've told us what they're about to do.
[00:38:12.441 --> 00:38:13.242]  How do we counter that?
[00:38:14.395 --> 00:38:26.054]  Well, first of all, he must stop talking, because I think the two people that are pushing him, and I know you're friends with them, I think Roger Stone and, um, um, uh, the, who's the general?
[00:38:27.576 --> 00:38:27.857]  Flynn!
[00:38:29.181 --> 00:38:29.682]  Clinton, yeah.
[00:38:29.962 --> 00:38:32.704]  They're both, you know, pushing nationalism.
[00:38:34.286 --> 00:38:41.312]  Both of them are pushing nationalism, which we have to be very careful about because Trump is saying, I'll be a dictator for a day.
[00:38:41.512 --> 00:38:43.754]  You cannot talk that rhetoric.
[00:38:43.814 --> 00:38:45.216]  He can't be a dictator.
[00:38:45.236 --> 00:38:46.177]  He has to be president.
[00:38:46.617 --> 00:38:50.861]  So we've got to stop him from speaking that rhetoric, even though it's a joke.
[00:38:51.875 --> 00:38:54.096]  He cannot be saying, I'll be a dictator for a day.
[00:38:54.596 --> 00:38:59.819]  Because then people say, if you're going to be a dictator for a day, you might be for a month or a year.
[00:39:00.159 --> 00:39:04.421]  And then that'll push some guys to try to strip the power away from the president.
[00:39:04.802 --> 00:39:25.622]   And the fact is that the president is commanding chief, and they want to try to remove that ability from the president to have power Well that's right, they're trying to define his normal duties and his office and his responsibility as martial law, as a dictator, while they themselves are establishing a totalitarian system.
[00:39:26.892 --> 00:39:28.272]  Yeah, but he shouldn't have joked about it.
[00:39:28.292 --> 00:39:30.373]  He shouldn't even just say, I'll be a dictator for a day.
[00:39:30.713 --> 00:39:35.254]  Because that falls into the whole rhetoric of what they want to do so they can remove his power.
[00:39:35.614 --> 00:39:37.355]  I mean, that's what a commander-in-chief is.
[00:39:37.415 --> 00:39:39.375]  He's the guy in charge of the military.
[00:39:39.816 --> 00:39:46.237]  So I think, obviously, we have to pray, number one, that the clowns don't get around him and take him in the wrong direction.
[00:39:46.838 --> 00:39:54.060]  And a lot of the people that are funded, there's even people funded by China, which I don't want to go public right now on this stuff.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.240]  I'll talk to you privately about it.
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:59.720]   that are actually coming around him that have billions and billions of dollars right now
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:04.999]   because they saw what just took place in Iowa. I think New Hampshire is going to be a whitewash again.
[00:40:04.999 --> 00:40:10.360]   So I think they realize he's going to get in and there's nothing they can do to stop it.
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:16.520]   So they want to come in and control the whole thing. And he had, according to what I'd heard
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.720]  from the inside, that he'd had 27 attempts on his life.
[00:40:19.892 --> 00:40:24.634]  I mean, that's how much they can't stand the guy because they know that he was putting a stop.
[00:40:24.674 --> 00:40:25.635]  We had no wars.
[00:40:26.255 --> 00:40:28.056]  Everything was turning around in America.
[00:40:28.576 --> 00:40:31.357]  Everything was coming the way that it was supposed to be.
[00:40:31.897 --> 00:40:38.380]  And so I'm glad Elon is at least giving a platform on X for us to speak all of these things.
[00:40:39.099 --> 00:40:43.280]  Well, that was one of my other questions at the time we have, and we'll get into geoengineering here in a moment.
[00:40:44.241 --> 00:40:50.263]  You told me when I was, years ago, and also when I was there with you last year at your church for a week, you said, don't underestimate Elon.
[00:40:50.743 --> 00:40:53.124]  He's a South African, you know, he's got stuff up his sleeve.
[00:40:53.144 --> 00:40:54.604]  I think he's probably good.
[00:40:54.924 --> 00:40:56.665]  Well, I see him coming way over to us.
[00:40:57.085 --> 00:41:00.126]  The globalists are coming after him with criminal investigations, the EU.
[00:41:00.146 --> 00:41:03.467]  I mean, he definitely is definitely going after him.
[00:41:03.487 --> 00:41:05.188]  I know people that know him well here in Austin.
[00:41:05.588 --> 00:41:07.489]  They say behind the scenes, he sounds just like us.
[00:41:07.529 --> 00:41:08.409]  He's really pissed off.
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:11.501]  Yeah, because he can see what's taking place.
[00:41:11.581 --> 00:41:12.661]  I mean, he's got everything.
[00:41:12.821 --> 00:41:13.941]  He doesn't need anything.
[00:41:14.542 --> 00:41:17.362]  But obviously he has a concern like we do.
[00:41:17.542 --> 00:41:19.703]  He sees things maybe from a different perspective.
[00:41:19.763 --> 00:41:21.684]  So I think he's a wrecking ball.
[00:41:22.024 --> 00:41:26.185]  And I just wish Trump would come back on X and be mouthing off.
[00:41:27.045 --> 00:41:29.006]  Yeah, that's really foolish that Trump won't.
[00:41:29.066 --> 00:41:32.187]  He could use X to promote truth social and make it even bigger.
[00:41:32.227 --> 00:41:32.727]  It's dumb.
[00:41:33.911 --> 00:41:35.912]  Yeah, but Truth Social is going nowhere.
[00:41:35.972 --> 00:41:38.793]  There's no, I mean, I get no response.
[00:41:38.973 --> 00:41:41.534]  No, I agree, but his argument is he's Truth Social.
[00:41:41.594 --> 00:41:45.616]  Yeah, use your, you know, 80-whatever-million followers and then push that.
[00:41:45.656 --> 00:41:49.278]  It's so, exactly, it's like having your right hand tied behind your back.
[00:41:49.598 --> 00:41:53.720]  That is, if Trump was doing X posts every day, they'd have a hundred million damn views.
[00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:55.260]  In fact, I agree.
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.121]  I know Roger talks to him every day.
[00:41:57.561 --> 00:42:01.643]  Everybody needs to call Trump and tell him, stop it, because that is a blunder.
[00:42:04.682 --> 00:42:05.483]  He needs to go on.
[00:42:06.083 --> 00:42:06.484]  Every day.
[00:42:07.104 --> 00:42:12.749]  He'll be dropping truth bombs on a daily basis, and still have truth on the side, but just dropping them.
[00:42:12.769 --> 00:42:14.471]  So, anyway, I'm just praying.
[00:42:14.951 --> 00:42:19.351]  I think I'm concerned about the wrong people in his ear.
[00:42:19.351 --> 00:42:24.911]   You know, and I've been invited to Mar-a-Lago many times, but I'm so busy focused on ministry, Alex,
[00:42:24.911 --> 00:42:27.490]  and nations and the things that we're doing.
[00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:28.670]  So I don't wanna get sidetracked.
[00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:30.309]  I love coming on your show.
[00:42:30.309 --> 00:42:32.070]  And then I do a weekly news program.
[00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:39.070]   And then I got banned on YouTube a week ago for seven days 'cause I'd made an announcement on Christmas Eve
[00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:40.809]  about vaccines, you know.
[00:42:40.809 --> 00:42:44.751]  Anyway, let's talk quickly about this chemtrail thing.
[00:42:44.758 --> 00:43:00.334]  So, I was talking to this doctor, and they were doing tests on people, and they said they kept finding people with deuterium, deuterium in their blood, and they said this will drop the population by 25%.
[00:43:01.975 --> 00:43:26.354]  Of course, as you know, all the spike protein, there was another doctor that I posted on my news program, that this 28-year-old German kid died, and they did, uh, uh, they bisected his testicles, his testes, and they found every, every sperm was replaced with a, um, with, um, uh, the metal, um, piece.
[00:43:26.814 --> 00:43:28.196]  Sorry, I forgot it now.
[00:43:28.216 --> 00:43:29.837]  We're putting it on screen right now, keep going.
[00:43:31.921 --> 00:43:37.186]  No, no, it was replaced with the spike protein, that's what I'm saying.
[00:43:37.526 --> 00:43:43.192]  So every sperm was converted with the spike protein.
[00:43:43.232 --> 00:43:45.093]  So there you've got it on the screen, deuterium.
[00:43:45.494 --> 00:43:53.621]  This thing is going to drop the population by 25%, which as you know is the end goal in human depopulation of the planet.
[00:43:54.022 --> 00:43:55.163]  So they'll do it by war.
[00:43:55.723 --> 00:43:56.804]  They'll do it by the chemtrails.
[00:43:57.084 --> 00:43:58.545]  Oh, yes, something else, Alex.
[00:43:58.605 --> 00:43:59.345]  Are you ready for this?
[00:43:59.726 --> 00:44:03.788]  Now, I don't have the source on this, but I'm going to get it and get it to you.
[00:44:04.348 --> 00:44:18.877]  But I was told that Disney Company paid somebody to go into every Disney movie and to put chemtrails in every scene so that everybody can just think chemtrails have been around for 50 years.
[00:44:20.838 --> 00:44:22.379]  They paid the person $60 million.
[00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:27.490]  Alex, can you imagine that?
[00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:28.811]  Absolutely.
[00:44:28.851 --> 00:44:30.811]  Look, I want to explain something.
[00:44:32.911 --> 00:44:34.612]  We had blue skies until the mid-90s.
[00:44:34.932 --> 00:44:36.212]  They won a Nobel Prize for this.
[00:44:37.172 --> 00:44:51.676]  At the adult level, the UN, the globalists, the WF admit that they're adding barium salts, alum dioxide, and deuterium into the jet fuel that then aerosolizes out, then causes clouds to form, but also gets into the ground and groundwater and soil.
[00:44:52.356 --> 00:44:56.659]  And it is absolutely destroying fertility of plants and all other animals and insects.
[00:44:57.119 --> 00:45:01.201]  So they are pesticiding the planet to cause a collapse.
[00:45:01.261 --> 00:45:09.566]  It's like they're shutting down the farms, just like they're saying all farming is a criminal act, the WEF, while they sit there, you know, eating these fine dinners.
[00:45:10.067 --> 00:45:14.509]  They are trying to collapse the carrying capacity of the world for depopulation.
[00:45:14.529 --> 00:45:20.573]   And I'm glad you bring up deuterium because I usually talk about aluminum salts And you'll bury them.
[00:45:20.953 --> 00:45:27.037]  And again, usually when we talk about geoengineering, we'll show smaller companies that do it just to make it rain for a ski resort.
[00:45:27.417 --> 00:45:28.638]  Everybody diverts off onto that.
[00:45:28.678 --> 00:45:30.219]  That's what we always show as a religion.
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:33.361]  But the issue is, this is not.
[00:45:33.401 --> 00:45:35.503]  This is low-level geoengineering.
[00:45:35.863 --> 00:45:41.347]  The real geoengineering goes on, not from small drones, not from small aircraft.
[00:45:41.947 --> 00:45:46.130]  It goes on with electromagnetic towers on the ground.
[00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:48.251]  I'm going to do a definitive report on this soon.
[00:45:49.812 --> 00:45:51.394]  This is all declassified.
[00:45:51.774 --> 00:45:53.916]  Towers on the ground that ionize the atmosphere.
[00:45:54.316 --> 00:45:56.037]  Then jets don't even know what they're doing.
[00:45:56.057 --> 00:45:56.958]  The companies don't even know.
[00:45:56.998 --> 00:45:58.679]  It's all the big major kerosene makers.
[00:45:58.899 --> 00:45:59.620]  That's jet fuel.
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:02.462]  Then it blows all this nuclei out.
[00:46:02.702 --> 00:46:08.847]  The cover story is for geoengineering, but really it goes into the soil, and that's what you were talking about with the deuterium.
[00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:24.113]  Yeah, so I mean, so what I found was quite amusing was that the Disney company paid a guy 60 million dollars to go into every Disney movie and whatever scene that they saw of a blue sky was to put chemtrails in there.
[00:46:24.133 --> 00:46:28.377]  So obviously I don't have verification on there, but that's what I heard yesterday.
[00:46:28.957 --> 00:46:32.239]  So, um, I mean, they're hell-bent on destroying people.
[00:46:32.479 --> 00:46:33.199]  They hate people.
[00:46:33.359 --> 00:46:34.299]  These people are scum.
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:41.582]  They want us to eat bugs, crickets, and every kind of insect while they're feasting on the finest of food.
[00:46:42.063 --> 00:46:46.384]  And I don't know about you, Alex, I'm not swapping a steak for crickets.
[00:46:47.085 --> 00:46:47.625]  I'm not doing it.
[00:46:47.645 --> 00:46:48.805]  It's not gonna happen.
[00:46:49.466 --> 00:46:52.549]   So, um, Anyway, everybody's got to stand up.
[00:46:52.609 --> 00:46:55.470]  We've got to pray and believe God that God will intervene.
[00:46:55.610 --> 00:47:02.754]  And of course, obviously, we're preaching the gospel, getting people saved, telling them Jesus is coming very soon and they need to surrender their life.
[00:47:03.214 --> 00:47:04.955]  I mean, we are living in the final hour.
[00:47:04.995 --> 00:47:06.115]  There's no question about it.
[00:47:06.976 --> 00:47:07.936]  But we're not done yet.
[00:47:08.937 --> 00:47:12.419]  And Jesus even said, when I come back, will I find faith on the earth?
[00:47:14.281 --> 00:47:15.281]  I know you've been through it.
[00:47:16.782 --> 00:47:33.849]  Even when you came and you were here with me for the week, you know, I just realized, I mean, the burden that you've carried and everything that you've spoken out in truth, basically from facts that you've had over the years, how people have taken it and twisted and lied about you.
[00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:42.733]   As before I came on the air, you were talking about Trump, they're talking about Stuff on his hands trying to signify that this is that and whatever.
[00:47:43.274 --> 00:47:47.336]  Um, the stuff people make up today and believe it is the truth is horrendous.
[00:47:47.917 --> 00:47:51.399]  And so, um, you have to ignore all of that and just keep moving on.
[00:47:51.999 --> 00:47:55.401]  Um, I've been lied about on every front, had books written about me.
[00:47:55.942 --> 00:48:02.526]  Um, according to the critics, I'm some hypnotist trained by some Indian, Indian Swami.
[00:48:02.946 --> 00:48:17.095]   And this, this stuff is so ludicrous that, uh, I can still remember when I got back in the 90s, somebody had written a book, a whole book about me, and I said to my wife, I was reading the book, I said, I can't believe I've done all these things.
[00:48:17.535 --> 00:48:19.377]  This is unbelievable, honey, listen to this.
[00:48:19.878 --> 00:48:21.239]  Apparently, we're supposed to have done this.
[00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:39.643]   So, in the end, you just have to totally ignore And not pay any attention to the rubbish and stay focused on what God's telling you to do, which I think, I mean, I'm so happy when Elon put you back, I was so, yes, I said, that's it.
[00:48:40.203 --> 00:48:40.643]  There it is.
[00:48:40.943 --> 00:48:42.544]  And I saw everything explode for you.
[00:48:42.804 --> 00:48:44.264]  Millions and millions of views and everything.
[00:48:44.705 --> 00:48:45.385]  I'm so happy.
[00:48:45.945 --> 00:48:47.745]  As I told you in September, don't give up.
[00:48:48.386 --> 00:48:52.407]  Not that you were, but you're about to have a breakthrough and you did actually have a breakthrough.
[00:48:54.022 --> 00:48:56.384]  Anyway, we just... By the way, I meant to mention that.
[00:48:57.085 --> 00:49:06.613]  You literally, because I've known you for years, but you had me out to your church and you had me for dinner and hung out with your family and the great crew and all the ministries coming through and how busy you were.
[00:49:06.693 --> 00:49:17.703]  I'd be going like nine o'clock at night and you were still meeting with pastors from all over the world and you said, listen, God told me you're about to have a breakthrough and God told me Elon Musk is going to put you back on X. Do you remember saying that?
[00:49:17.743 --> 00:49:19.305]  I was kind of like, I don't think so, Pastor.
[00:49:20.752 --> 00:49:26.662]  I, I, maybe, maybe I don't remember saying Elon's going to put you back, but I do remember saying you were going to have a breakthrough.
[00:49:26.742 --> 00:49:27.704]  I felt it so strong.
[00:49:27.784 --> 00:49:29.006]  I felt that, that you were going to...
[00:49:30.276 --> 00:49:31.817]  Well, listen, I'm not putting words in your mouth.
[00:49:31.877 --> 00:49:37.639]  You might have forgotten, but I think you were, if I remember correctly, we've been praying or we were walking out of the prayer area.
[00:49:37.659 --> 00:49:39.340]  We were praying for like at least an hour.
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.821]  You said, you know, I just believe you're going to have a breakthrough.
[00:49:41.841 --> 00:49:43.061]  God is telling me I'm going to have a breakthrough.
[00:49:43.081 --> 00:49:50.505]  And I believe, I think you said, I believe Musk is going to put you back on X. And then, and then all your enemies are just going to be, I remember exactly what you said.
[00:49:50.545 --> 00:49:51.125]  You can't remember?
[00:49:51.145 --> 00:49:52.245]  It was, it was something like that.
[00:49:53.506 --> 00:49:53.646]  Yeah.
[00:49:54.144 --> 00:49:54.484]  Sorry.
[00:49:54.885 --> 00:50:01.951]  I know, I know, I know that the Lord rubs dung on the faces of our enemies, you know, when we serve him, when our hearts are pure.
[00:50:02.372 --> 00:50:12.141]  And I mean, Alex, I've known you, I've been listening to you for a long time, so I know that your total motive has got nothing to do with, and nobody chooses to do what you do with another motive.
[00:50:12.722 --> 00:50:19.448]  Because, I mean, all you did was paint a target on yourself where people came after you, came after your family, came after your children, came after everything.
[00:50:19.969 --> 00:50:21.610]  So it's the same as Trump.
[00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:29.592]  When you're worth billions, why would you put yourself at risk trying to save America and turn things around, you know?
[00:50:30.752 --> 00:50:32.153]  But I'm so excited.
[00:50:32.193 --> 00:50:36.774]  I was so happy when I saw you come on live and I watched everything explode for you.
[00:50:36.834 --> 00:50:38.335]  And I think it's going to get bigger and bigger.
[00:50:38.775 --> 00:50:43.638]  Well, I know I can feel the Holy Spirit really strong around you and that's one of those that have it.
[00:50:43.658 --> 00:50:45.019]  We feel it really strong around you.
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:48.522]  What was God telling you when you said, you're about to have a breakthrough?
[00:50:48.582 --> 00:50:49.522]  It's about to reverse.
[00:50:49.802 --> 00:50:50.823]  It's about to turn around.
[00:50:51.143 --> 00:50:53.805]  And when you invited me out there, I guess you've been praying for me.
[00:50:54.025 --> 00:50:55.006]  I don't want to say I was depressed.
[00:50:55.046 --> 00:50:59.229]  I wasn't going to give up, but I was just kind of like totally exhausted and didn't know what to do.
[00:50:59.649 --> 00:51:00.570]  And it was an answer to prayer.
[00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:01.290]  We're almost out of time.
[00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:03.552]  But what did God tell you when you told me that?
[00:51:03.572 --> 00:51:06.133]  Because you did specifically tell me it's imminent.
[00:51:06.173 --> 00:51:06.934]  It's about to happen.
[00:51:07.134 --> 00:51:07.995]  That was just a few months ago.
[00:51:08.835 --> 00:51:20.987]  I felt, I felt, I was like really upset how the lies can keep coming against somebody, pounding, pounding, and everybody just, because you had been totally deplatformed on every side.
[00:51:21.027 --> 00:51:24.450]  And I kept saying, surely there has to be a breakthrough.
[00:51:24.490 --> 00:51:30.576]  You cannot, the wicked cannot prevail over the righteous like what it's doing right now.
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:36.584]  And so, and I understand you you you wrap around the hedges for some people in the religious world.
[00:51:36.984 --> 00:51:40.007]  I am as well because I say things just like they are.
[00:51:40.167 --> 00:51:41.308]  I don't hold anything back.
[00:51:42.068 --> 00:51:51.735]  So, um, but the bottom line is I felt in my spirit that there was going to be a total breakthrough for you and I felt that it's come and I don't feel it's going to stop.
[00:51:51.816 --> 00:51:58.544]   I think it's going to be breakthrough upon breakthrough because everything they do from now on out Is already totally exposed.
[00:51:58.584 --> 00:52:00.405]  If you go... Pastor, stay there.
[00:52:00.445 --> 00:52:05.787]  Do five more minutes with us ahead of Jack Pasobic, because I want to hear about what God's telling me, because we're going to see breakthroughs for everybody, though.
[00:52:06.207 --> 00:52:07.168]  I'm just one example.
[00:52:07.508 --> 00:52:08.288]  And lead us in a prayer.
[00:52:08.508 --> 00:52:09.449]  We're back in two minutes.
[00:52:09.789 --> 00:52:10.749]  Revival.com.
[00:52:10.769 --> 00:52:11.650]  Pastor Rodney Harbrown.
[00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:17.853]  And he doesn't want to brag and toot his horn, but he specifically, we prayed for about an hour in his office.
[00:52:18.573 --> 00:52:19.795]  Or in the little side room by it.
[00:52:20.015 --> 00:52:23.220]  And, uh, he was just like, bam, it's going to be broken.
[00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:23.921]  It's going to happen.
[00:52:23.981 --> 00:52:26.965]  I was just like, and, and I, it wasn't that I believed it.
[00:52:26.985 --> 00:52:30.551]  I knew it was true and it's happening folks.
[00:52:30.831 --> 00:52:31.973]  We'll be right back in two minutes.
[00:52:32.273 --> 00:52:32.654]  Stay with us.
[00:52:37.615 --> 00:52:41.856]  You can see here the Great Awakening orbiting the Great Reset.
[00:52:42.576 --> 00:52:52.318]  Although the depopulation systems of the Great Reset are not yet fully operational, the Great Reset does have a strong conspiracy network.
[00:52:52.778 --> 00:52:58.679]  It is protected by a satanic shield, which can be disabled by the Great Awakening.
[00:52:59.059 --> 00:53:05.260]  The Great Reset must be deactivated if any victory for humanity is to be accomplished.
[00:53:06.306 --> 00:53:20.355]  Once the Great Awakening deactivates the shield, InfoWars.com forward slash show will cover the truth while Info Warriors fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the Great Reset.
[00:53:20.855 --> 00:53:24.597]  Alex Jones has volunteered to lead the fighter attack.
[00:53:24.937 --> 00:53:43.985]   Get a signed copy of the Great Awakening today at InfoWarsStore.com Jack Masovic is on with us in six minutes, but Pastor Rodney Howard Brown called me last year and he said, God has laid it on my heart to take you here and bless you and pray with you and you're going to have a breakthrough.
[00:53:44.005 --> 00:53:45.086]  And he remembers that.
[00:53:45.106 --> 00:53:45.866]  I was talking to him during the break.
[00:53:45.886 --> 00:53:46.507]  I said, okay, I'll come.
[00:53:47.128 --> 00:53:50.431]  And then the whole time it was like a pep talk and praying and intensely.
[00:53:50.811 --> 00:53:51.632]  And I received it.
[00:53:52.112 --> 00:53:54.194]  But man, he said, you watch, it's about to happen.
[00:53:54.275 --> 00:53:55.596]  And it did happen.
[00:53:55.636 --> 00:53:56.236]  It is happening.
[00:53:57.375 --> 00:54:02.279]  Finish up with what God was telling you, and then larger picture for everybody here.
[00:54:02.299 --> 00:54:04.160]  Because evil just doesn't always win.
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:05.821]  God, in the end, turns it around.
[00:54:06.802 --> 00:54:08.323]  Yeah, and that was the thing for me.
[00:54:08.644 --> 00:54:10.845]  I was watching everything that was thrown at you.
[00:54:10.865 --> 00:54:15.169]  I said, my wife, I said, how can one person take all of this?
[00:54:15.609 --> 00:54:16.590]  I mean, it's impossible.
[00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:18.411]  I mean, these people are liars.
[00:54:18.791 --> 00:54:19.492]  They're liars.
[00:54:20.172 --> 00:54:21.413]  What he's saying is the truth.
[00:54:21.934 --> 00:54:25.136]  So because he's exposing everything, they're coming after him.
[00:54:25.156 --> 00:54:26.217]  They're trying to take him out.
[00:54:26.883 --> 00:54:28.064]  So, I mean, I just prayed.
[00:54:28.124 --> 00:54:29.686]  I said, Lord, we have to have a victory.
[00:54:29.726 --> 00:54:34.210]  And that's when I felt, if you could just come here for a week, in actual fact, you need to come back.
[00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:37.914]  I've got a lot of stuff happening, and you'll enjoy doing what we're doing here.
[00:54:37.934 --> 00:54:42.879]  But anyway, bottom line is, no, and of course, the breakthrough has come.
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:53.027]   Nobody was happier when I saw you go live on X. And I don't believe this is This is only the beginning, Alex, and you're going to see it pick up the next couple of months.
[00:54:53.307 --> 00:54:56.989]  This year's going to be a very strong year for InfoWars and for everybody.
[00:54:57.049 --> 00:55:06.674]  And my encouragement to everybody here watching today, don't give up, keep speaking the truth, keep talking exactly what God puts on your heart.
[00:55:07.134 --> 00:55:13.838]  Obviously, for the Christians, we've got to preach the gospel, get people saved, tell them that there's a heaven to gain and a hell to shun.
[00:55:14.598 --> 00:55:19.880]  All they have to do is invite Jesus to come in their heart, repent of their sin, and to say, Lord, come into my heart.
[00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:23.862]  You know, maybe you're watching right now, you're Catholic or whatever, it doesn't matter.
[00:55:24.142 --> 00:55:27.483]  You need Jesus to come into your heart and just surrender your life.
[00:55:27.503 --> 00:55:28.644]  Just pray this loud.
[00:55:28.984 --> 00:55:34.466]  Say, dear Lord Jesus, come into my heart, forgive me of my sin, and I'll serve you.
[00:55:34.526 --> 00:55:34.946]  That's it.
[00:55:35.266 --> 00:55:36.367]  It's very simple.
[00:55:36.427 --> 00:55:38.108]  It's not a long, drawn-out thing.
[00:55:38.387 --> 00:55:42.867]   You don't have to go through seven circumcisions and a bunch of rigamarole.
[00:55:42.867 --> 00:55:46.106]   If you genuinely mean business with God, God means business with you.
[00:55:46.106 --> 00:55:50.387]   So Alex, from now on out, I see that this is gonna be a year
[00:55:50.387 --> 00:55:51.547]  for the church of victory.
[00:55:51.547 --> 00:55:52.906]  I think they want nuclear war.
[00:55:52.906 --> 00:55:56.387]  I think they want a lot of disaster stuff to take place.
[00:55:56.387 --> 00:55:58.307]  I don't see them getting away.
[00:55:58.307 --> 00:56:01.708]   In my spirit, I don't see them getting away with what they wanna do.
[00:56:01.708 --> 00:56:05.746]  I think they realize it's too far gone right now.
[00:56:05.791 --> 00:56:13.175]  I think they're going to have to wait maybe another 15, 20 years for this thing to cycle and for it to come around again.
[00:56:13.235 --> 00:56:25.802]  I think they played their best shots they had mainly because a lot of the guys, Soros and all these guys are like nearly 100 years old and the Rothschilds, I know, you know, whatever, and they just want to see it all happen before they die.
[00:56:26.102 --> 00:56:29.444]  Well, many of them are dropping dead like flies now and they're not going to see it then.
[00:56:31.575 --> 00:56:33.528]  Kissinger and Charlie Munger died the same week.
[00:56:34.488 --> 00:56:35.428]  Correct, correct.
[00:56:35.488 --> 00:56:46.792]  So, basically they're not going to get to see, and now they begin to realize in a lost eternity how wrong they were, because they're not in purgatory, they actually, you know, went to hell.
[00:56:47.132 --> 00:56:49.133]  I mean, there's no... Can God save them?
[00:56:49.193 --> 00:56:57.935]  I'm not saying He can't, but the likelihood of them being saved very remote, because for most of their life they denied God and didn't even allow Him in their life.
[00:56:58.015 --> 00:57:01.496]  And so, the Bible says the point a man wants to die after death, the judgment.
[00:57:01.757 --> 00:57:02.857]  The fact of the matter is this.
[00:57:03.297 --> 00:57:04.881]  That righteousness will prevail.
[00:57:06.483 --> 00:57:15.185]  Wickedness cannot prevail, and when the righteous stand, there'll be many lies that go out, but the lies will fade into nothingness, and truth will stand.
[00:57:15.505 --> 00:57:17.045]  So I think, let's pray for Trump.
[00:57:17.425 --> 00:57:25.967]  Let's pray that the dogs don't get close to him, and that the wrong people are not influencing him, and trying to put a whole industrial military complex around him.
[00:57:26.407 --> 00:57:35.430]   Pray that he picks the right person for VP, and not somebody like Nikki Haley, or the other one, Gabby, or the other Well, I love Ben.
[00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:40.193]  Well, Pastor, I will come see you soon, and I love you and your great congregation.
[00:57:40.593 --> 00:57:44.056]  The Spirit of the Lord is so strong in your church.
[00:57:44.096 --> 00:57:47.218]  Everybody can get to that area in Florida, should be going to your amazing River Church.
[00:57:47.238 --> 00:57:47.699]  Revival.com.
[00:57:47.539 --> 00:57:52.378]   love Ben. Well, Pastor, I will come see you soon and I love you and your great congregation.
[00:57:52.378 --> 00:57:54.699]  The Spirit of the Lord is so strong in your church.
[00:57:54.699 --> 00:58:01.179]   Everybody can get to that area in Florida should be going to your amazing River Church, Revival.com.
[00:58:01.179 --> 00:58:03.218]  Thank you, Pastor.
[00:58:03.801 --> 00:58:07.942]  Our conference starts this Sunday and runs for eight days, so it's a very big conference.
[00:58:08.022 --> 00:58:10.102]  It's called the Winter Camp Meeting, so people come.
[00:58:10.962 --> 00:58:11.642]  God bless you, sir.
[00:58:12.903 --> 00:58:13.403]  Bless you, too.
[00:58:13.583 --> 00:58:14.403]  Thank you so much.
[00:58:14.523 --> 00:58:15.703]  We'll be right back with Jack Posobiec.
[00:58:16.023 --> 00:58:18.624]  All right, folks, we've just got him for about 20 minutes.
[00:58:19.404 --> 00:58:31.706]  Jack Posobiec is one of the best analysts out there, great patriot, reporter, journalist, and, of course, former naval intelligence, big part of the last two and now the third Trump campaign to restore our republic.
[00:58:32.566 --> 00:58:35.388]  And he joins us now, of course, he's with HumanEvents.com.
[00:58:35.408 --> 00:58:38.631]  You can find him and Jack Posobiec on X and everywhere else.
[00:58:38.671 --> 00:58:40.372]  Hard to miss Jack Posobiec.
[00:58:40.752 --> 00:58:46.897]  I asked Jack this morning to come on despite his busy schedule because we have NATO mobilizing 90,000 troops.
[00:58:47.618 --> 00:58:50.800]  We have the German government top document leaking that they believe war is imminent.
[00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:53.602]  We have the Swedish defense minister saying prepare for war last week.
[00:58:53.622 --> 00:58:57.465]  We have the British Ministry of Defense saying this is the march to larger wars.
[00:58:58.206 --> 00:58:59.627]  This is a big development.
[00:58:59.647 --> 00:59:05.648]   We have them putting in this EU puppet there is the Prime Minister in Poland.
[00:59:05.648 --> 00:59:11.927]   Meanwhile, Jack has said watch for Pakistan, India and Iran to be a potential flare point.
[00:59:11.927 --> 00:59:15.007]  Now they're firing missiles at each other.
[00:59:15.007 --> 00:59:19.648]   We also have some big pipe bomb news that's come out revealed a plainclothes police officer
[00:59:19.648 --> 00:59:25.407]   discovered the DNC pipe bomb and now Jack has of course posted on X that it's basically
[00:59:25.407 --> 00:59:29.248]  identical to the FBI training pipe bombs they use.
[00:59:29.568 --> 00:59:31.050]  So I'm going to try to give Jack the floor.
[00:59:31.391 --> 00:59:34.396]  We've got 22 minutes of airtime with him.
[00:59:34.556 --> 00:59:35.318]  Jack Posobiec.
[00:59:36.579 --> 01:00:02.168]  Alex, thanks again so much for having me on, and of course we're still in the prep work for Human Events Daily, which comes up later, but I really wanted to get on with you because when I saw this NATO news drop and the 90,000 troops, this massive, largest exercise since the Cold War, where they will be deploying 90,000 troops, including what we're told, and this is out of Stars and Stripes, they say, reinforcements from North America.
[01:00:02.648 --> 01:00:04.189]  Guess what, boys and girls?
[01:00:04.509 --> 01:00:05.290]  That means us.
[01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:10.414]  That means American men and American women are going to be there in Poland, in the Baltics.
[01:00:10.454 --> 01:00:13.577]  Of course, most of this will be taking place on the territory of Poland.
[01:00:13.937 --> 01:00:16.139]  Everybody knows that I've been talking about Poland lately.
[01:00:16.159 --> 01:00:21.303]  I've been specifically highlighting Poland, of course, because of its proximity to Ukraine.
[01:00:21.543 --> 01:00:25.487]  And then, of course, because of the new globalist commissars that have taken over the country.
[01:00:25.527 --> 01:00:31.492]  They're locking up their officials left and right, the opposition officials, locking up a former foreign minister.
[01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:35.292]  Just yesterday, the reprisals continue.
[01:00:35.872 --> 01:00:44.378]  But Alex, a few weeks ago, you and I were getting fact-checked and corrected, and we're getting really slapped down, because what did we say?
[01:00:44.697 --> 01:00:51.018]   We said that Poland would be used for troops to agitate or something would happen, potentially
[01:00:51.018 --> 01:00:58.737]   a flashbang, a false flag to be used to incite a wider war with Russia.
[01:00:58.737 --> 01:01:02.817]   And we came on this program and we've been talking about it and they said it's not possible,
[01:01:02.817 --> 01:01:04.896]  that's crazy, they're never going to do this.
[01:01:04.896 --> 01:01:06.617]  And then all of a sudden, what does NATO do?
[01:01:06.617 --> 01:01:12.737]   They turn around and they announce the largest war games in Poland, in of course Poland and
[01:01:12.737 --> 01:01:15.216]  the Baltic region since the Cold War.
[01:01:15.216 --> 01:01:20.538]   And they say we're going to be simulating, we're going to be simulating conflict with
[01:01:20.538 --> 01:01:22.136]  a near peer competitor.
[01:01:22.163 --> 01:01:27.744]  Okay, that's military-speak, that's interagency-speak for it's going to be a war game with Russia.
[01:01:28.284 --> 01:01:31.725]  They're going to be war-gaming, fighting Russia on Ukrainian territory.
[01:01:31.765 --> 01:01:35.546]  Look, you know, I've been to Poland, I've been to Ukraine, I've been very familiar with this region.
[01:01:37.706 --> 01:01:42.067]  The territory, the terrain, it's almost identical from Poland into Ukraine.
[01:01:42.087 --> 01:01:44.848]  This is lowlands, this is flat, this is farmland.
[01:01:45.328 --> 01:01:50.814]  They're going to have potentially mock-ups of Russian tanks, the T-90s, T-70s, that'll be going up against it.
[01:01:50.854 --> 01:02:00.625]  And we're already, by the way, seeing some of this in action because there's already NATO armor and NATO equipment being used in the war in Ukraine just next door.
[01:02:01.145 --> 01:02:03.849]  We can have archivists go and find it, but people were tuned in.
[01:02:03.869 --> 01:02:05.331]  A lot of millions saw you say it.
[01:02:05.371 --> 01:02:17.208]  It went viral on X. You said two months ago, I'm worried they're going to put a NATO-EU puppet in control of Poland to mobilize it for wartime economy as a direct contour into Ukraine to continue the war.
[01:02:17.908 --> 01:02:19.829]  And now, indeed, all that's happened.
[01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:23.571]  You warned, I think they'll fire some more missiles into Poland, blame it on Russia.
[01:02:23.872 --> 01:02:26.333]  They did that three days after you predicted it.
[01:02:26.353 --> 01:02:29.355]  So you've been absolutely on the zeitgeist, dead on.
[01:02:29.695 --> 01:02:31.096]  Tell us what you think's coming next.
[01:02:31.936 --> 01:02:33.897]  Is Ukraine serious about a peace deal?
[01:02:34.117 --> 01:02:39.020]  There's all this big talk in the mainstream news about a coup against Zelensky, putting the defense minister in.
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:41.642]  What are the pieces here, and how do we get peace?
[01:02:42.486 --> 01:02:46.528]  Look, I think Zelensky is going to come back from this World Economic Forum empty-handed.
[01:02:46.548 --> 01:02:52.910]  And it's very simple, because people know inside and outside that Zelensky isn't the guy calling the shots.
[01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:59.573]  Remember, the Chinese delegation to the World Economic Forum refused to even meet with Zelensky.
[01:02:59.913 --> 01:03:01.314]  He said, he said, please come.
[01:03:01.334 --> 01:03:03.354]  And this is like one of their junior diplomats.
[01:03:03.394 --> 01:03:04.695]  It wasn't even the foreign minister.
[01:03:04.975 --> 01:03:06.976]  And even that guy said, no, we're not interested.
[01:03:07.016 --> 01:03:09.057]  We don't have any room on our schedule for you.
[01:03:09.417 --> 01:03:12.178]  That shows how far his status has fallen.
[01:03:12.638 --> 01:03:18.922]  Really, since the eye of everything has turned to the Middle East over the past couple of weeks.
[01:03:18.942 --> 01:03:21.944]  We'll talk about that in a minute here since October 7th.
[01:03:22.364 --> 01:03:26.206]  But what Zelensky has realized is that he's living on borrowed time.
[01:03:26.306 --> 01:03:27.147]  He's not the guy.
[01:03:27.407 --> 01:03:30.068]  He's not interested in making a peace deal with Russia.
[01:03:30.128 --> 01:03:33.651]  But at this point, right, at this point, he needs to understand.
[01:03:33.671 --> 01:03:40.774]   And what I would say to Zelensky, and I've been saying this for over a year now, NATO does not want a peace deal with Russia.
[01:03:41.214 --> 01:03:44.615]  NATO wants you to go down with the ship.
[01:03:44.935 --> 01:03:45.975]  Do you understand?
[01:03:46.375 --> 01:03:48.535]  You and your country are being used.
[01:03:48.555 --> 01:03:50.276]  You're like the end of the pencil.
[01:03:50.536 --> 01:03:53.897]  They're going to use you down until there's nothing but a nub left.
[01:03:54.237 --> 01:04:02.318]  And then, maybe then, they'll continue on because they've been seeking this wider war with Russia for over a decade now.
[01:04:02.378 --> 01:04:03.959]  These people are hell-bent on it.
[01:04:04.259 --> 01:04:05.539]  People like Victoria Nuland.
[01:04:07.790 --> 01:04:18.240]  And they'll use Zelensky as a reset to blame all the failures on him, and then try to have a new military reset with a provocation with Moldovia or with Poland.
[01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:20.682]  I mean, clearly that's how this playbook works.
[01:04:20.722 --> 01:04:21.803]  What do you expect to happen next?
[01:04:22.463 --> 01:04:27.428]  Look, I said before, you know, Zelensky's role as a hero is pretty much tapped out.
[01:04:27.448 --> 01:04:28.409]  There's no juice left.
[01:04:28.429 --> 01:04:30.030]  There isn't any water left in that well.
[01:04:30.050 --> 01:04:33.273]  But there's one card left to play, and that's Zelensky as the martyr.
[01:04:33.429 --> 01:04:39.028]   Zelensky as the victorious martyr who wouldn't leave his country and said,
[01:04:39.028 --> 01:04:43.509]   "Don't send me a plane, send me ammo," and you have these ridiculous people selling t-shirts of him
[01:04:43.509 --> 01:04:50.148]   and calling themselves America first at the same time. And no, they will try to take whatever
[01:04:50.148 --> 01:04:55.429]   legacy he has built into his brand and then translate that into... And by the way, when I'm
[01:04:55.429 --> 01:04:57.447]  laying all this up, you say, "Oh, you're just speculating."
[01:04:57.447 --> 01:05:01.849]   This is exactly what we did in South Vietnam. This was the exact CIA playbook of South
[01:05:01.849 --> 01:05:05.268]   Vietnam with the South Vietnamese Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem.
[01:05:05.485 --> 01:05:06.106]  They used him.
[01:05:06.246 --> 01:05:07.087]  He was a hero.
[01:05:07.387 --> 01:05:09.989]  He was this great man who was standing up against communism.
[01:05:10.049 --> 01:05:23.241]   He was standing up in the fight for freedom and then all the way to the point where the Tet Offensive happens and then things aren't going well and then, whoop, he gets taken out and now he's a martyr and now we got to send people back over because that's We've got to do it for him.
[01:05:23.501 --> 01:05:25.983]  So they'll say, we have to do it for Zelensky.
[01:05:26.023 --> 01:05:27.424]  That's why we've got to get involved.
[01:05:27.464 --> 01:05:28.805]  That's why NATO's got to get involved.
[01:05:28.825 --> 01:05:32.508]  That's why Poland has to send its peacekeeping forces in.
[01:05:32.588 --> 01:05:37.392]  Look, all of this, unfortunately, looks like it's unfolding before our eyes, which I was wrong.
[01:05:37.512 --> 01:05:43.336]  I would love to be proven wrong on this stuff, but when I see the headlines every day, it seems like this is the direction we're marching.
[01:05:43.396 --> 01:05:47.600]  You said that three months ago, two months ago, a month ago, you've been 100% on, which is frightening.
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:52.783]   So looking at this, is there, is there, Any hope to a peace deal?
[01:05:53.444 --> 01:05:54.645]  Because we hear about peace deals.
[01:05:55.165 --> 01:05:56.146]  Now Zelensky's desperate.
[01:05:56.166 --> 01:05:57.207]  He's talking about a peace deal.
[01:05:57.507 --> 01:05:58.788]  But NATO doesn't want a peace deal.
[01:05:58.808 --> 01:06:06.673]  We have the, as you know, build reporting of four days ago that the top of the German Defense Ministry believes war with Russia is imminent.
[01:06:07.354 --> 01:06:09.956]  Now we see the call of troops, just as we said three weeks ago.
[01:06:10.656 --> 01:06:16.861]   We have the Defense Minister of Sweden publicly saying, go buy food and water and gasoline, get ready for war.
[01:06:16.881 --> 01:06:19.284]  You have the British Defense Ministry saying the same thing.
[01:06:20.104 --> 01:06:21.666]  But again, it's not even getting big attention.
[01:06:21.686 --> 01:06:25.910]  They're saying, we're on a war path with Russia, and it should be the top story.
[01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:26.190]  It's not.
[01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:27.531]  So what does all that signify?
[01:06:30.634 --> 01:06:34.737]  Germany right now is in dire... well, the German government, I should say, is in dire straits.
[01:06:34.877 --> 01:06:40.061]  Olaf Scholz is at the lowest popularity he's ever had in his entire chancellorship.
[01:06:40.682 --> 01:06:46.066]  Angela Merkel never got to this point during her entire decade plus in that same role.
[01:06:46.106 --> 01:06:47.687]  He's basically her heir over there.
[01:06:47.887 --> 01:06:49.588]  You could see the farmers in the streets.
[01:06:49.809 --> 01:06:50.949]  You could see the tractors.
[01:06:50.989 --> 01:06:52.511]  We could see the truckers getting involved.
[01:06:52.651 --> 01:06:56.173]   In fact, even some Polish truckers We're getting involved in the German protests.
[01:06:56.213 --> 01:07:00.256]  When the Poles and the Germans are on the same side against you, you know you messed up.
[01:07:01.236 --> 01:07:04.018]  And so Olaf Scholz is getting completely desperate.
[01:07:04.418 --> 01:07:05.859]  He's in a desperation play.
[01:07:05.919 --> 01:07:08.720]  He might, and then AFD completely on the rise over there.
[01:07:08.761 --> 01:07:14.104]  If you go and look what AFD is doing, they are rising so much that they're trying to ban them even as a party.
[01:07:14.144 --> 01:07:18.886]  That's your right wing, your pro nationalist kind of party over there.
[01:07:19.987 --> 01:07:31.132]  And so, Olaf Scholz is in danger of losing his chancellorship, and when people get desperate like that, Alex, it pushes them to do desperate things and make desperate moves.
[01:07:31.412 --> 01:07:32.473]  Hail Mary, please.
[01:07:32.873 --> 01:07:38.076]  This is the reason that we're starting to see now Germany talk more about getting involved more.
[01:07:38.116 --> 01:07:46.046]   Now, I do appreciate the fact, and I'll add this to the analysis, that the German Budenstag just voted against giving cruise
[01:07:46.046 --> 01:07:50.445]   missiles, long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine. And of course, that's not coming from
[01:07:50.445 --> 01:07:53.644]   Scholes, that's coming from the Budenstag. Because you know what, Alex, here's the
[01:07:53.644 --> 01:07:59.885]   thing, the dirty little secret is all of this is happening because Germany cut off their
[01:07:59.885 --> 01:08:04.936]   access to low-cost energy that they were getting through those pipelines, that Nord Stream 2
[01:08:04.936 --> 01:08:11.166]   pipeline, which by the way, was not blown up by Russia, it was blown up, look, obviously with US assets,
[01:08:11.166 --> 01:08:16.164]   obviously with US help, probably some Ukrainian forces were involved, looks like the operation
[01:08:16.164 --> 01:08:19.326]   came out of Poland, but at the end of the day, look, you'd...
[01:08:19.541 --> 01:08:21.182]  You take the industrial espionage out of it.
[01:08:21.482 --> 01:08:22.203]  What was the point?
[01:08:22.223 --> 01:08:25.765]  The goal was the destruction of the industrial core of Germany, right?
[01:08:25.845 --> 01:08:30.808]  All those great German cars that we see around, the Volkswagens, the BMWs, the luxury models, the Audis.
[01:08:31.708 --> 01:08:36.951]  Well, that's what Newland famously said, as you know, like eight years ago in the tape that got recorded by the Russians.
[01:08:36.971 --> 01:08:37.652]  They admit it was real.
[01:08:37.992 --> 01:08:39.913]  They said, hey, a war in Ukraine is going to hurt Europe.
[01:08:40.173 --> 01:08:41.654]  And she said, fuck Europe.
[01:08:42.435 --> 01:08:44.777]  Yeah, look, remember what Lord Ismay said.
[01:08:44.837 --> 01:08:49.960]  The first commander of NATO, Lord Ismay, laid out the policies for NATO.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.501]  He said it's very clear, right?
[01:08:51.521 --> 01:08:53.062]  And he's a British general.
[01:08:53.823 --> 01:09:00.067]  He said the purpose of NATO is to keep Russia out, to keep the U.S.
[01:09:00.407 --> 01:09:02.969]  in, and to keep Germany down.
[01:09:03.489 --> 01:09:10.514]  And you look at the way these moves have been playing out for the last two years, it's exactly as he said.
[01:09:10.894 --> 01:09:11.894]  Germany's the real target.
[01:09:11.894 --> 01:09:13.733]  So we're talking next level here.
[01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:16.854]   You have devastated, and I'm not kissing your ass, it's true folks, nobody's done analysis
[01:09:16.854 --> 01:09:18.134]  like this the last three months.
[01:09:18.134 --> 01:09:19.733]  Jack has been scarily on target.
[01:09:19.733 --> 01:09:21.333]  Now you wish you weren't right.
[01:09:21.333 --> 01:09:23.894]  Give us bad case scenarios and good case scenarios.
[01:09:23.894 --> 01:09:25.293]  Can we get peace?
[01:09:25.293 --> 01:09:26.293]  What's that scenario?
[01:09:26.293 --> 01:09:27.932]  What's the percentage in your mind?
[01:09:27.932 --> 01:09:31.293]   Guestimation, dead reckoning, and then what's the bad scenario?
[01:09:31.293 --> 01:09:34.253]   Tell us what you don't want to happen but you think's going to happen.
[01:09:34.253 --> 01:09:39.253]   Well I'd give it maybe a 25% chance, but I would say in terms of an actual peace deal,
[01:09:39.253 --> 01:09:43.094]   what's actually going to happen is look, Ukraine is going to be turned into a rump state, and
[01:09:43.094 --> 01:09:50.573]   then the real question is, will NATO be used as the world police force of the globalist
[01:09:51.287 --> 01:09:55.311]  The American Order, the New World Order, whatever you want to call it, the globalists in Brussels.
[01:09:55.451 --> 01:10:02.358]  Look, they even are talking publicly now about the Atlanticist access that exists at the World Economic Forum.
[01:10:02.378 --> 01:10:03.459]  They're saying this from the stage.
[01:10:03.479 --> 01:10:06.682]  30 years ago, 20 years ago, they were calling you Timberland.
[01:10:06.722 --> 01:10:09.204]  You, Alex, were saying that NATO would be used as this.
[01:10:09.885 --> 01:10:11.847]  You were derided as a conspiracy theorist.
[01:10:12.467 --> 01:10:14.810]  Now they're up there at the World Economic Forum.
[01:10:14.850 --> 01:10:17.734]  Well, that was in their documents that they would use a world crisis.
[01:10:18.535 --> 01:10:23.722]  They said 20 years ago, we'll use a crisis with Russia to elevate NATO to the world police force.
[01:10:24.899 --> 01:10:26.962]  It's exactly right, and this is what they've always done.
[01:10:27.002 --> 01:10:42.721]  And this is why when Trump came around and Trump said, look, if the Soviet Union's not around anymore, why don't we turn NATO into a, you know, a counter-terrorism organization, a counter-trafficking, narco-trafficking, sex-trafficking, child-trafficking, wouldn't that be great if we could all work together, make them sort of like a, you know, an Interpol police force?
[01:10:43.041 --> 01:10:46.242]  And now they're arresting the political opposition, which you predicted months ago, in Poland.
[01:10:46.262 --> 01:10:47.522]  So what's the timeline of wider war?
[01:10:47.542 --> 01:10:49.663]  Why are these documents coming out that NATO believes they're war?
[01:10:49.483 --> 01:10:52.802]   running all those networks and they've been running those networks from the
[01:10:52.802 --> 01:10:57.842]   very start. And now they're arresting the political opposition. Now they're
[01:10:57.842 --> 01:11:01.182]   arresting the political opposition which you predicted months ago in Poland. So
[01:11:01.182 --> 01:11:05.082]   what's the timeline of wider war? Why are these documents coming out that NATO
[01:11:05.082 --> 01:11:08.762]   believes they're war? Why would anyone do this? And we got to, you got to go, you
[01:11:08.762 --> 01:11:12.521]   got to prepare your own show in like 35 minutes. Let's get in to the Middle East
[01:11:12.521 --> 01:11:16.882]   because again we can pull the clips up folks. You said months ago, right after
[01:11:16.882 --> 01:11:19.382]  October 7th you were on like the week after you said...
[01:11:19.382 --> 01:11:21.382]  I'll put it this way Alex, I'll put it this way...
[01:11:21.272 --> 01:11:24.213]  The chess pieces are being moved around right now because it's winter.
[01:11:24.253 --> 01:11:32.916]  So as we're in winter, as those fighting fields are non-operable for these big pushes, these big moves, they are going to be unoperable.
[01:11:32.976 --> 01:11:39.478]   And then you're still not going to be able to see that in the spring because as the ice thaws in this area, then you're gonna get to the muddy season.
[01:11:39.478 --> 01:11:43.177]   So there'll still be a bit of time, but when summer rolls around,
[01:11:43.177 --> 01:11:45.617]   so we're talking about six months time, for example, - Look for provocations.
[01:11:45.617 --> 01:11:50.018]   five months time, that's when you potentially see major, major pushes.
[01:11:50.018 --> 01:11:54.097]   And by the way, the Russians are massing on their side as well because they know about this.
[01:11:54.097 --> 01:11:58.837]   Like best, I would say best case scenario at this point is a Ukraine that's split in two,
[01:11:58.837 --> 01:12:04.578]   where you've got sort of an East-West scenario, kind of like Germany at the end of World War II,
[01:12:04.578 --> 01:12:06.738]  where you get, you know, East-West Germany.
[01:12:06.726 --> 01:12:08.486]  I think that's probably the best case scenario.
[01:12:08.546 --> 01:12:14.848]  And then a frozen conflict, where, you know, there won't be peace, but there'll be a ceasefire and armistice.
[01:12:14.888 --> 01:12:21.950]  But worst case, Poland is pushed into full war as a proxy, then the NATO claims, oh, there's an attack on a NATO country, we go to full war.
[01:12:22.898 --> 01:12:26.701]  Yeah, the absolute worst case scenario is the invocation of Article 5, and it always has been.
[01:12:26.721 --> 01:12:37.209]  And this is why you see people constantly attempting... Look, Zelensky went to the World Economic Forum and went up there and said, your troops need to come over here and fight our war.
[01:12:37.450 --> 01:12:42.193]  He said that on the stage in Switzerland, in Davos, standing next to Klaus Schwab.
[01:12:42.414 --> 01:12:44.235]  Your troops need to fight our war.
[01:12:44.255 --> 01:12:44.595]  And now U.S.
[01:12:44.615 --> 01:12:45.456]  troops... What does that mean?
[01:12:45.676 --> 01:12:47.237]  He's talking about Article 5.
[01:12:48.237 --> 01:12:49.038]  That's right, and now U.S.
[01:12:49.058 --> 01:12:51.519]  troops are being mobilized for part of this NATO op war game.
[01:12:51.859 --> 01:12:56.162]  So, in the seven minutes we have left, or six minutes, let's hit the incredible developments in the Middle East.
[01:12:56.202 --> 01:13:02.066]  You said months ago, like a week after October 7th, you said, this is an Iranian-Chinese trap.
[01:13:02.106 --> 01:13:03.087]  We're being lured in.
[01:13:03.387 --> 01:13:06.389]  Look for them to try to attack the Red Sea, close Strait of Hormuz.
[01:13:06.429 --> 01:13:07.250]  Now it's all happening.
[01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:09.491]  Now Iran has hit Pakistan.
[01:13:09.531 --> 01:13:10.472]  Pakistan has hit Iran.
[01:13:10.552 --> 01:13:12.814]  I mean, this is the stuff of World War III.
[01:13:13.527 --> 01:13:19.113]  Well, Alex, it is the stuff of World War III, but I want to remind people to go play that game of the map again, right?
[01:13:19.313 --> 01:13:20.714]  It's all about the maps.
[01:13:20.794 --> 01:13:22.116]  It's all about the maps, right?
[01:13:22.156 --> 01:13:24.158]  The maps will cut through the rhetoric.
[01:13:24.438 --> 01:13:26.260]  So where is Balochistan?
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:32.647]  So Balochistan is the separatist group that operates on both sides of the border between Pakistan and Iran.
[01:13:32.867 --> 01:13:35.870]  But what, and so they attack the Iranians, they attack the Pakistanis.
[01:13:36.090 --> 01:13:45.416]  But at the same time, you've got Pakistan's ISI military over there, their military intelligence, which are directly tied to the CIA, constantly used to provocate against Iran.
[01:13:45.717 --> 01:13:49.119]  Iran provocates back, and then they blame it on the Balochistan separatists.
[01:13:49.159 --> 01:13:51.280]  These are intel operations going against each other.
[01:13:51.721 --> 01:13:56.504]  And so, when you're looking at this, what is it directly across from, Alex?
[01:13:56.644 --> 01:13:59.446]  It's directly across from the Strait of Hormuz.
[01:13:59.566 --> 01:14:02.047]  This is why this area is so key.
[01:14:02.348 --> 01:14:10.614]   Because if they are able to send missiles back and forth, On that side of the border, now you're at the mouth of the Persian Gulf.
[01:14:10.954 --> 01:14:14.497]  The mouth of the oil flow of the entire world.
[01:14:14.577 --> 01:14:26.708]  If they're able to shut that down on either side, whether it's Pakistan, so you know that's the CIA sending a message, and then Iran sending their message right back saying, we are willing to fight back whatever you do.
[01:14:26.728 --> 01:14:30.491]  Okay, now you've got all of these competing interests again.
[01:14:31.031 --> 01:14:35.745]   This is the friction point like two Tectonic plates.
[01:14:35.905 --> 01:14:39.908]  This is the tectonic friction line between the empires.
[01:14:40.168 --> 01:14:46.393]  So you've got Persia and then you've got Pakistan, which is still aligned with the globalist American empire on some things.
[01:14:46.413 --> 01:14:54.539]  But at the same time, Pakistan is kind of a wild card because they've also got direct ties to who's right across their border in China.
[01:14:54.579 --> 01:14:56.441]  So this is a very, very dangerous.
[01:14:56.481 --> 01:14:58.102]  And this is how world wars break out.
[01:14:58.122 --> 01:15:00.964]  I know that I, this is exactly how world wars break out.
[01:15:00.984 --> 01:15:02.946]  It's exactly how world war one broke out.
[01:15:03.206 --> 01:15:10.748]  Because you had secret alliances, you had national security agencies all playing games with each other while the people were kept in the middle.
[01:15:11.128 --> 01:15:12.028]  Incredibly dangerous.
[01:15:12.248 --> 01:15:19.570]  Alright, let's hit the pipe bomb news because you've been all over this being a federal drill and to draw resources away.
[01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:27.981]   This photo that Human Events received from a source very late last night uh... who you know it uh... i'll just say it's a federal
[01:15:27.981 --> 01:15:30.171]   source uh... that sent this in
[01:15:30.171 --> 01:15:35.011]   and and look you know anybody who's been in uh... military intelligence or
[01:15:35.011 --> 01:15:38.711]   federal law enforcement i ran with you the a couple of times
[01:15:38.711 --> 01:15:41.671]   in our different parts of the world where i was deployed as an intel officer
[01:15:41.671 --> 01:15:55.365]   attached to you the units Um, and I said, look, these, these training material, that bomb that came out looks exactly like the training materials that we would use every single day in, in the military, in the field.
[01:15:55.405 --> 01:15:57.206]  And so people are saying, well, wait, wait, wait, that looks fake.
[01:15:57.226 --> 01:16:00.667]  I said, that's my point is it's, you're supposed to know that it looks fake.
[01:16:00.887 --> 01:16:03.629]  So anyone who's had any training before I say, yeah, it's a training aid.
[01:16:03.909 --> 01:16:05.189]  That's not a real pipe bomb.
[01:16:05.269 --> 01:16:08.728]   But at the same time, of course, when you're running capital security,
[01:16:08.728 --> 01:16:12.248]   when you know it's January 6th, you have to take it seriously
[01:16:12.248 --> 01:16:13.769]  and you have to call it in as it is.
[01:16:13.769 --> 01:16:17.569]   Of course, the other big news that we got, and so the photo that I posted,
[01:16:17.569 --> 01:16:22.689]   which does come from a federal facility, is the exact same end caps, the exact same pipes,
[01:16:22.689 --> 01:16:28.548]   the exact same timers that you see on the pipe bomb, which is recovered on January 6th,
[01:16:28.548 --> 01:16:30.429]  planted, of course, January 5th.
[01:16:30.429 --> 01:16:34.329]   The real question now, the biggest question, I know Darren Beattie, we're gonna have him on the show
[01:16:34.329 --> 01:16:36.849]  on human events later today, is the timing.
[01:16:36.849 --> 01:16:42.208]   Alex, the timing of this was exactly, the timing of the finding of the pipe bomb
[01:16:42.208 --> 01:16:47.208]   was exactly as people were first, those first early waves were penetrating.
[01:16:47.631 --> 01:16:50.490]  areas of the lawn and knocking down barricades.
[01:16:50.490 --> 01:16:52.871]   Because when a lot of the Trump supporters got there, they said, what barricades, what
[01:16:52.871 --> 01:16:53.871]  barricades on the lawn?
[01:16:53.871 --> 01:16:54.871]  What are you talking about?
[01:16:54.871 --> 01:16:55.871]  There's no barricades, they're right across the barricade.
[01:16:55.871 --> 01:16:58.191]  I just walked on the lawn like I would any other day.
[01:16:58.191 --> 01:17:00.470]  I take my kids on that lawn for years.
[01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:02.931]  No one's ever seen barricades there before.
[01:17:02.931 --> 01:17:11.591]   And so the finding of this pipe bomb creates a chain reaction whereby in the House offices
[01:17:11.591 --> 01:17:14.791]  on that side of the Capitol are evacuated.
[01:17:14.791 --> 01:17:17.310]  This is what leads AOC to scream, they're coming for me.
[01:17:17.310 --> 01:17:22.551]   They're coming for me, which of course, remember, AOC, this is very, very suspicious because
[01:17:22.551 --> 01:17:27.931]   AOC said they're coming for me before anyone had even arrived at the Capitol.
[01:17:27.931 --> 01:17:29.710]  No one was even there yet.
[01:17:29.710 --> 01:17:31.390]  So why did she think people were coming in?
[01:17:31.406 --> 01:17:34.107]  And we got Pelosi with the TV crews and all of it.
[01:17:34.127 --> 01:17:34.867]  A big production.
[01:17:34.887 --> 01:17:36.248]  They hoped it would have gone through.
[01:17:36.968 --> 01:17:38.249]  From your own research, Jack.
[01:17:38.309 --> 01:17:39.389]  Oh, and I haven't said it yet.
[01:17:39.409 --> 01:17:45.472]  I haven't said it yet, but the very lead on this is that we've always been told it was a passerby who made that phone call in.
[01:17:45.792 --> 01:17:48.913]  Now we know that it was a plainclothes law enforcement officer.
[01:17:48.953 --> 01:17:50.394]  And why did they try to cover that up, Jack?
[01:17:51.448 --> 01:17:52.728]  That's a great question, Alex.
[01:17:53.068 --> 01:17:57.249]  That's a great question, because I'd love to know, were you really just walking by there?
[01:17:57.510 --> 01:18:01.270]  Were you really just walking by, deciding to take a look at the back of that fence?
[01:18:01.711 --> 01:18:04.831]  Or did someone tell you to go look behind?
[01:18:04.991 --> 01:18:07.252]  Hey man, hey, go check behind the bench.
[01:18:07.292 --> 01:18:08.472]  Did you get a text message?
[01:18:08.732 --> 01:18:10.413]  Did you get an anonymous tip?
[01:18:10.753 --> 01:18:15.654]  Boy, I'd really love if the House GOP were able to find this guy and haul him in.
[01:18:15.814 --> 01:18:21.094]   subpoena him and everyone else that's involved with this thing because the more we find out about it,
[01:18:21.094 --> 01:18:23.334]  the darker and more sinister it appears.
[01:18:23.334 --> 01:18:25.333]  Well, that's probably--
[01:18:24.672 --> 01:18:26.432]  A lot of people say, move on to January 6th.
[01:18:26.893 --> 01:18:32.414]  All Trump supporters know it was a provocative action, but it's like the string on the sweater that unravels the whole thing.
[01:18:32.814 --> 01:18:34.994]  This can show how they engineered the whole thing.
[01:18:35.014 --> 01:18:37.095]  I wasn't even planning on talking about it.
[01:18:37.135 --> 01:18:38.235]  I wasn't even planning on bringing it up.
[01:18:38.275 --> 01:18:39.555]  I said, I said, yeah, we'll get to it.
[01:18:39.575 --> 01:18:40.335]  We'll see if we get something.
[01:18:40.355 --> 01:18:43.336]  And then I get this photo and then we find out about the police officer.
[01:18:43.376 --> 01:18:44.596]  I said, this, this is real.
[01:18:44.856 --> 01:18:45.056]  Okay.
[01:18:45.076 --> 01:18:45.976]  This is all happening.
[01:18:46.256 --> 01:18:47.357]  This is all happening.
[01:18:47.477 --> 01:18:48.677]  It's breaking in real time.
[01:18:49.297 --> 01:18:53.619]  I know Tucker and Darren Beattie are going to be dropping something later tonight around 6 p.m.
[01:18:53.799 --> 01:18:54.180]  Eastern.
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:19:04.505]  I don't know what they're going to be talking about, but I have been told that they've got a big, a really, really big analysis piece coming out that isn't even involved with the plainclothes officer or this pipe bomb fraud that we've had.
[01:19:04.765 --> 01:19:06.666]  But I did talk to another EOD officer.
[01:19:07.168 --> 01:19:10.929]   guy who I served with, and he said to me, look, he said, Jack, here's what it is.
[01:19:10.929 --> 01:19:16.208]   The fact that it's a training aid is meant so that if another law enforcement trained
[01:19:16.208 --> 01:19:20.729]   guy, like a bomb disposal guy, EOD guy, explosive ordnance disposal guy, finds this, then they
[01:19:20.729 --> 01:19:25.769]   would readily identify, snap their fingers, they would know that's not a real pipe bomb.
[01:19:25.769 --> 01:19:30.969]   So it's almost like a signal to other federal law enforcement that, hey, this was planted
[01:19:30.969 --> 01:19:31.969]  by one of ours.
[01:19:31.969 --> 01:19:35.367]  We got 30 seconds, 40 seconds left.
[01:19:35.367 --> 01:19:36.367]  Trump's dominating.
[01:19:36.864 --> 01:19:37.845]  30 seconds on the campaign.
[01:19:39.306 --> 01:19:52.160]  Look, this campaign is actually getting into a very dangerous place because what we're going to see now is that Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, they are going to continue to push this divide in the party.
[01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:56.872]  Of course, Trump had an absolute domineering presence in Iowa.
[01:19:56.892 --> 01:19:58.252]  They said he wasn't even going to win Iowa.
[01:19:58.272 --> 01:19:59.473]  They said Iowa was going to be close.
[01:19:59.513 --> 01:20:00.213]  It wasn't close at all.
[01:20:00.253 --> 01:20:02.034]  It was a 30 point blowout.
[01:20:02.614 --> 01:20:04.655]  New Hampshire, they're trying a lot of tricks up there.
[01:20:04.675 --> 01:20:06.176]  This is and then Jamie Dimon.
[01:20:06.476 --> 01:20:06.756]  All right.
[01:20:06.816 --> 01:20:14.900]  Jamie Dimon coming out, by the way, yesterday over at Davos, this little Ukraine flag pin saying, oh, I'm very interested in, you know, MAGA movement.
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:17.421]  Hey, let me be your secretary of the Treasury.
[01:20:17.441 --> 01:20:21.143]  And then he turns around and he starts saying how bad crypto is and how evil crypto is.
[01:20:21.223 --> 01:20:23.204]  And Satoshi's laughing at you and all this stuff.
[01:20:23.504 --> 01:20:25.505]  Look, we know what's going on, Alex.
[01:20:25.805 --> 01:20:30.388]  The next threat of all of this is that the snakes are going to try to get back in.
[01:20:30.428 --> 01:20:34.411]  People like Jamie Dimon, who, by the way, was Jeffrey Epstein's banker.
[01:20:34.731 --> 01:20:35.331]  That's right.
[01:20:35.371 --> 01:20:36.952]  Great job, Jack Posobiec.
[01:20:37.292 --> 01:20:38.253]  29 years on air.
[01:20:38.573 --> 01:20:41.555]  All I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalists.
[01:20:42.259 --> 01:20:47.582]  And I've done the best job I can to tell the truth and be accurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[01:20:47.982 --> 01:20:54.406]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves, unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people.
[01:20:54.666 --> 01:20:55.346]  We don't do that.
[01:20:55.807 --> 01:20:57.728]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[01:20:58.088 --> 01:21:00.089]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product.
[01:21:00.129 --> 01:21:00.770]  It's so powerful.
[01:21:01.650 --> 01:21:06.653]  This is the breakdown product, after your cells process it, of folic acid.
[01:21:07.233 --> 01:21:11.677]   Methylfolate with high-quality organic Be complex.
[01:21:12.157 --> 01:21:13.378]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[01:21:13.438 --> 01:21:14.279]  It's not a stimulant.
[01:21:14.539 --> 01:21:19.423]  It energizes your cells and then everything else you take just supercharges it.
[01:21:19.463 --> 01:21:20.303]  It's so insane.
[01:21:20.643 --> 01:21:22.145]  It's foundational energy.
[01:21:22.625 --> 01:21:26.748]  The strongest formula out there at InfoWarstore.com.
[01:21:27.148 --> 01:21:31.191]  It doesn't just energize this operation against the tyrants, it energizes you.
[01:21:31.472 --> 01:21:32.873]  Get foundational energy now!
[01:21:36.872 --> 01:21:43.696]  If you go to the Drudge Report, and I think it'll still be up, there's a story that talks about Trump having hand cuts.
[01:21:44.237 --> 01:21:45.157]  And you can link to it.
[01:21:45.337 --> 01:21:47.199]  They don't look like cuts to me.
[01:21:48.119 --> 01:21:49.060]  They look like sores.
[01:21:50.163 --> 01:21:59.648]  And I've asked a number of MDs what medical condition manifests itself through hand sores, and the answer is immediate and unanimous.
[01:22:00.169 --> 01:22:01.369]  Secondary syphilis.
[01:22:02.110 --> 01:22:02.870]  All right?
[01:22:03.010 --> 01:22:05.292]  I think there's a good chance this man has the clap.
[01:22:05.892 --> 01:22:08.393]  And I'm not being particularly secretive about it.
[01:22:09.094 --> 01:22:11.235]  I am texting the photo.
[01:22:11.515 --> 01:22:12.336]  You can link to it.
[01:22:12.376 --> 01:22:14.917]  It's in some operation called the Daily Mail.
[01:22:14.977 --> 01:22:15.717]  It's some British thing.
[01:22:15.778 --> 01:22:18.039]  It's probably a Fleet Street rag.
[01:22:18.979 --> 01:22:24.182]  You know, maybe the picture was doctored or whatever, but maybe this story will go somewhere.
[01:22:24.222 --> 01:22:24.763]  Maybe it won't.
[01:22:24.843 --> 01:22:30.126]  But I'm telling you at one o'clock Eastern, I'm humping this thing like a young dog on old furniture.
[01:22:30.767 --> 01:22:32.448]  Golfers vasculitis.
[01:22:33.088 --> 01:22:34.409]  That's what Trump has.
[01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:42.714]  And we see desperate Democrat Party operative James Carville putting out videos and Drudge Report and others picking it up.
[01:22:42.974 --> 01:22:44.435]  Does Trump have syphilis?
[01:22:44.975 --> 01:22:51.295]   The instant I saw his hand, where it's worn, where you hold the club, and where the index
[01:22:51.295 --> 01:22:57.135]   finger grips it, and the thumb, is what I grew up witnessing when I played golf.
[01:22:57.135 --> 01:22:59.335]  Now I quit playing golf by the time I was 16.
[01:22:59.335 --> 01:23:00.894]  I had other stuff to do.
[01:23:00.894 --> 01:23:02.735]  But I would routinely get it.
[01:23:02.735 --> 01:23:05.775]   If you were around a golf course, walk up there and talk to golfers.
[01:23:05.793 --> 01:23:10.316]  Out of ten of them, two or three will have tape on their fingers, on their thumbs, and you'll ask, what's wrong?
[01:23:10.336 --> 01:23:12.318]  They'll say, I've got golfer's rash.
[01:23:13.078 --> 01:23:22.745]  So you can see it's perfect golfer's rash, the way you hold it, and the stroke when you come in puts a lot of pressure on the index finger, and on the thumb, and right here.
[01:23:23.165 --> 01:23:24.526]  He has golfer's rash.
[01:23:24.566 --> 01:23:29.550]  The man plays up to two complete 18 rounds a day.
[01:23:30.430 --> 01:23:31.030]  Do that twice.
[01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:34.351]  He is a top scratch golfer, almost professional.
[01:23:34.711 --> 01:23:36.151]  And this isn't about even defending Trump.
[01:23:36.171 --> 01:23:38.432]  It's about defending reality.
[01:23:38.452 --> 01:23:39.452]  And I am sick of it.
[01:23:39.472 --> 01:23:41.433]  These people are so desperate.
[01:23:42.113 --> 01:23:48.874]  They've got all these kangaroo courts, rigged events, trials without juries, all the indictments.
[01:23:49.494 --> 01:23:50.475]  He's a Russian spy.
[01:23:50.535 --> 01:23:51.495]  Women are peeing on him.
[01:23:52.210 --> 01:23:55.411]  None of it's true, ladies and gentlemen, and none of the things they've said about me are true either.
[01:23:55.731 --> 01:23:59.912]  They're a lying pack of scum, and Carville has no shame.
[01:24:00.372 --> 01:24:02.272]  President Trump is a golfer.
[01:24:02.652 --> 01:24:04.273]  It's his golfing hand.
[01:24:04.753 --> 01:24:06.913]  The one that grips down the furthest is the right hand.
[01:24:07.313 --> 01:24:08.674]  That's where you tend to get it.
[01:24:09.054 --> 01:24:09.954]  Everybody knows it.
[01:24:10.194 --> 01:24:12.014]  He doesn't have syphilis.
[01:24:13.355 --> 01:24:15.515]  All right, I'll be covering this live today at 11 a.m.
[01:24:15.335 --> 01:24:21.173]   centralinfowars.com/show and follow me @realalexjones here on X.
[01:24:21.173 --> 01:24:33.335]   While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you
[01:24:33.335 --> 01:24:36.774]  the truth about what's happening next.
[01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:39.693]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[01:24:41.634 --> 01:24:48.518]  Avi Yamini joins us in T-minus 23 and a half minutes from Davos on a mountaintop in Switzerland.
[01:24:49.278 --> 01:24:50.799]  He's got a bunch of new clips he sent us.
[01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:54.340]  More confrontations just happened.
[01:24:54.340 --> 01:25:03.340]   You know, I normally play a report twice in a show, but I shot that right before I went live today at 11 a.m.
[01:25:03.736 --> 01:25:04.877]  Central an hour and a half ago.
[01:25:06.057 --> 01:25:11.959]  They're saying Trump has syphilis when he's clearly got golfer rash, right where you get it on your hand from playing golf.
[01:25:13.279 --> 01:25:19.321]  And we know they're liars, but it just shows there's no desperate level they won't go to.
[01:25:21.342 --> 01:25:28.764]  Now, I've got all this other news I want to hit, but we have the murder of our judicial system.
[01:25:30.239 --> 01:25:36.101]  And the weaponization of it, the murder of justice, and the full capture of our judicial system in many areas.
[01:25:36.581 --> 01:25:38.942]  They don't control the Supreme Court totally, that's why they're in panic mode.
[01:25:39.883 --> 01:25:42.744]  But they've got so many of these other courts, federal and state, around the country.
[01:25:42.804 --> 01:25:52.987]  And you have this Carol lady, who decades later, never followed police reports, says Trump grabbed her at a shopping mall closet.
[01:25:54.728 --> 01:25:57.049]  And Trump says, I'm innocent, which everybody's right to say.
[01:25:58.871 --> 01:26:08.939]  So she sues him not for rape, because there's no evidence of that, but for defaming her when she attacked him and she's a Democratic Party operative.
[01:26:12.282 --> 01:26:18.087]  And then she sues him again for saying he's innocent again, but he's out in statements saying he's innocent again.
[01:26:21.192 --> 01:26:23.753]  And then you've got Mitt Romney saying Republicans are evil.
[01:26:24.074 --> 01:26:24.954]  He's always been a Democrat.
[01:26:24.974 --> 01:26:26.275]  Mitt Romney's the worst.
[01:26:27.055 --> 01:26:29.897]  Because they'll vote for a rapist who's been found guilty of rape.
[01:26:30.217 --> 01:26:30.737]  He hasn't.
[01:26:31.358 --> 01:26:37.161]  A jury in New York, where the judge wouldn't let Trump put on a defense, he's now asking to get the second trial bill to talk.
[01:26:37.181 --> 01:26:38.162]  The judge is saying no.
[01:26:38.522 --> 01:26:40.143]  Just like in New York with the real estate.
[01:26:41.023 --> 01:26:42.344]  It's insane, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:43.365 --> 01:26:46.286]  And then the media says, oh, he's so bad, he's mad in the court.
[01:26:48.147 --> 01:26:50.769]  Trump has warned he may be ejected from Carroll trial.
[01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:53.301]  Because he's moving around too much.
[01:26:54.863 --> 01:26:59.246]  Mitt Romney rips out of touch with reality Trump voters.
[01:26:59.646 --> 01:27:05.691]  Mitt Romney rips out of touch with reality voters who don't care a jury found Trump raped a woman.
[01:27:05.711 --> 01:27:08.574]  No, they found he defamed her by saying he was innocent.
[01:27:10.295 --> 01:27:27.287]   So Mitt Romney says you can't say you're innocent as if he fools us that he's a Republican when we all know What he is, is an establishment globalist.
[01:27:28.047 --> 01:27:27.287]  100%.
[01:27:29.528 --> 01:27:30.148]  Through and through.
[01:27:30.248 --> 01:27:31.308]  Shame on Mitt Romney.
[01:27:33.329 --> 01:27:34.909]  Here's Trump on True Social.
[01:27:34.989 --> 01:27:41.811]  I've said it once and I'll say it again a thousand times until this ridiculous hoax was revealed to me by Fox News Media.
[01:27:41.911 --> 01:27:44.812]  I never heard of Jane, of E. Jean Carroll.
[01:27:45.774 --> 01:27:46.655]  Never had anything to do with her.
[01:27:47.175 --> 01:27:49.257]  Never would want to have anything to do with her.
[01:27:49.698 --> 01:27:54.763]  Never brought her into a locked changing room at a crowded New York City department store.
[01:27:55.383 --> 01:27:56.885]  Directly opposed the checkout booth.
[01:27:57.165 --> 01:28:01.289]  I never touched her or in any way would want to touch her.
[01:28:02.030 --> 01:28:04.512]  The whole story is made up and disgusting hoax.
[01:28:05.052 --> 01:28:07.595]  Like the now fully discredited Russia, Russia, Russia hoax.
[01:28:08.015 --> 01:28:08.936]  And all the others.
[01:28:09.016 --> 01:28:14.189]   This one is also Conceived funded and carried out the Democratic political
[01:28:14.189 --> 01:28:18.637]   operatives like her lawyer who I just beat in another scam case
[01:28:18.637 --> 01:28:25.509]   Roberts Caplan Piglet Reed Hoffman and major Democrat donors who is
[01:28:25.509 --> 01:28:31.229]   funding his wife to another and it's gone completely nuts judge Kaplan knows
[01:28:31.229 --> 01:28:35.378]   this and All about the fake dress, but won't let it be
[01:28:35.378 --> 01:28:42.118]   released broken justice Wow
[01:28:42.118 --> 01:28:48.557]   Now that E. Jean Carroll is admitted to illegally deleting and destroying mountains of evidence as well as it seems unlawfully
[01:28:48.557 --> 01:28:52.858]   owning a gun and buying Ammunition if judge Lewis Kaplan does the right thing a
[01:28:52.858 --> 01:28:57.439]   patriotic thing he will immediately dismiss the current election interference which on trial
[01:28:57.439 --> 01:29:00.338]  Which the reverse was unfair?
[01:29:00.338 --> 01:29:08.009]   Based on the result of the first sham trial which was forced upon a very popular successful president the United
[01:29:08.009 --> 01:29:11.219]   States of America me The crooked Joe Biden.
[01:29:11.772 --> 01:29:16.053]  Discredited conspiracy of hoaxes and scams is falling apart like a rotten house of cards.
[01:29:16.193 --> 01:29:17.073]  Make America great again.
[01:29:20.994 --> 01:29:23.194]  Have you watched this woman's videos online?
[01:29:23.334 --> 01:29:26.295]  I mean, we're talking a full-on cuckoo bird.
[01:29:30.115 --> 01:29:31.336]  No witnesses he ever met her.
[01:29:31.396 --> 01:29:32.436]  No witnesses to any of it.
[01:29:33.176 --> 01:29:33.896]  Doesn't matter.
[01:29:34.416 --> 01:29:37.797]  Juries say you're not allowed to say you're innocent.
[01:29:38.786 --> 01:29:48.269]  Since when are you not allowed, since when saying I'm innocent, I don't know you, since when is that defamation?
[01:29:50.430 --> 01:29:52.530]  Well, it's these jurisdictions where they control the juries.
[01:29:53.451 --> 01:29:54.791]  And I've been through this myself.
[01:29:56.332 --> 01:30:03.034]  They had Daily Mail articles five years ago saying I did things and said things that I never did 1% of.
[01:30:03.134 --> 01:30:07.293]  1% of it was all 100% made up.
[01:30:07.293 --> 01:30:15.293]   They claim I grabbed a woman's ass in my break room and said,
[01:30:15.293 --> 01:30:16.293]  I want to have a baby with you.
[01:30:16.309 --> 01:30:20.371]  100% not true.
[01:30:21.791 --> 01:30:26.353]  They said that there was a fish tank in the office and I was mad at employees so I grabbed their fish and ate it.
[01:30:26.933 --> 01:30:27.834]  Never had a fish tank here.
[01:30:28.274 --> 01:30:29.875]  That's from Wolf of Wall Street, folks.
[01:30:31.129 --> 01:30:36.590]  And I have all these witnesses, the other people that have worked here since this office was opened 15 years ago, in these studios.
[01:30:37.110 --> 01:30:38.790]  There's never been a pet here.
[01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:40.671]  A few times people brought their dogs.
[01:30:40.891 --> 01:30:42.051]  There's never been a fish tank.
[01:30:43.751 --> 01:30:44.471]  But does it matter?
[01:30:45.211 --> 01:30:46.852]  It just sounds evil, doesn't it?
[01:30:48.692 --> 01:30:51.092]  So I'm gonna play a clip of her when we come back, how rape is sexy.
[01:30:52.493 --> 01:30:53.913]  Then she starts hitting on Anderson Cooper.
[01:30:56.113 --> 01:30:56.833]  These people are sick.
[01:30:59.014 --> 01:30:59.634]  Extremely sick.
[01:31:01.365 --> 01:31:03.547]  But they're discredited and people know they're full of crap.
[01:31:04.628 --> 01:31:06.310]  We have a right to say we think you're full of crap.
[01:31:07.611 --> 01:31:18.042]  Oh, we're banging heads now with the New World Order.
[01:31:21.405 --> 01:31:22.226]  Oh, Father!
[01:31:24.589 --> 01:31:28.992]  I will never see the light of Lucifer.
[01:31:29.032 --> 01:31:33.994]  I only see the light of God.
[01:31:34.114 --> 01:31:36.036]  I don't see the false light.
[01:31:36.096 --> 01:31:38.096]  I see the real light.
[01:31:38.096 --> 01:31:54.096]  [Music]
[01:31:54.096 --> 01:31:56.096]  Till you're bleeding, New World Order.
[01:31:56.096 --> 01:31:58.096]  The battle is now.
[01:31:58.096 --> 01:32:00.096]  Now!
[01:31:59.385 --> 01:32:01.266]  Stop bowing to their propaganda.
[01:32:01.326 --> 01:32:03.347]  Stop bowing to their intimidation.
[01:32:03.387 --> 01:32:05.848]  Stop bowing to their lies.
[01:32:06.048 --> 01:32:10.511]  We all know President Trump didn't assault that woman.
[01:32:11.931 --> 01:32:14.372]  We all know he didn't work for the Russians.
[01:32:15.073 --> 01:32:17.694]  We all know I'm not in any of America.
[01:32:18.955 --> 01:32:23.257]  And we all know you out there listening and watching want freedom!
[01:32:27.051 --> 01:32:28.993]  We've gotta stop bowing to these scum.
[01:32:29.013 --> 01:32:32.077]  Let's play a clip of this kook.
[01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:35.962]  Where Trump can't even say he's innocent.
[01:32:36.563 --> 01:32:37.404]  Here's Carol.
[01:32:38.385 --> 01:32:41.148]  Literally having a psychotic meltdown on CNN.
[01:32:43.311 --> 01:32:44.032]  Don't feel like a victim.
[01:32:44.409 --> 01:32:46.191]  I was not thrown on the ground and ravished.
[01:32:46.751 --> 01:32:50.714]  Which, the word rape carries so many sexual connotations.
[01:32:50.974 --> 01:32:53.637]  This was not, this was not sexual.
[01:32:54.457 --> 01:32:55.818]  It just, it hurt.
[01:32:56.039 --> 01:32:57.740]  It just, what, it just, you know.
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:02.244]  I think most people think of raping as a, I mean it is a violent assault.
[01:33:02.324 --> 01:33:02.704]  It is not.
[01:33:02.744 --> 01:33:05.206]  I think most people think of rape as being sexy.
[01:33:06.888 --> 01:33:07.568]  Let's take a short break.
[01:33:07.608 --> 01:33:08.849]  Think of the fantasies.
[01:33:08.869 --> 01:33:11.792]  Yeah, think of the fantasies.
[01:33:13.055 --> 01:33:14.615]  No one's allowed to say they don't believe you.
[01:33:14.655 --> 01:33:15.916]  No one's allowed to say they're innocent.
[01:33:16.576 --> 01:33:21.695]   or you'll have some cook jury with some democrat judge charge you 10 million dollars.
[01:33:21.695 --> 01:33:32.576]  She saw that her book wasn't selling so she made the accusation.
[01:33:32.799 --> 01:33:33.899]  Put that headline back up there.
[01:33:34.719 --> 01:33:36.920]  And look, I know you already know this, folks.
[01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:39.080]  You've got to really get down to brass tacks, how evil they are.
[01:33:40.165 --> 01:33:43.147]  You know, I'm not a big fan of the UFC.
[01:33:43.167 --> 01:33:45.889]  I'm not against people fighting and I'm not against combat sports.
[01:33:45.949 --> 01:33:46.729]  I'm not against sports.
[01:33:46.789 --> 01:33:50.452]  I just don't spend my time because I'm in the big battle against the New World Order.
[01:33:50.472 --> 01:33:56.715]  But I get California trying to ban contact football for little kids is the nanny state, is the control.
[01:33:56.996 --> 01:33:58.517]  I think sports is great for kids.
[01:33:58.537 --> 01:33:59.457]  I think football's great.
[01:33:59.737 --> 01:34:00.738]  I think track's great.
[01:34:00.758 --> 01:34:01.659]  I think basketball's great.
[01:34:01.679 --> 01:34:02.459]  I think baseball's great.
[01:34:02.479 --> 01:34:03.220]  I think golf's great.
[01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:04.240]  I think wrestling's great.
[01:34:04.260 --> 01:34:05.101]  I think boxing's great.
[01:34:06.249 --> 01:34:20.352]  It just can't be the only thing you focus on, but now California, I'll cover this coming up, has a bill and the majority of votes, the governor's going to have to veto it, because it's just so obvious how evil it is, to ban football in California.
[01:34:21.872 --> 01:34:26.513]  Well, I like what Sean Strickland, the middleweight heavyweight champion, and I want to get him on the show, by the way.
[01:34:27.254 --> 01:34:28.354]  I want him on the show.
[01:34:28.374 --> 01:34:31.795]  I'd probably call Joe Rogan and get his number, but that's who I want on.
[01:34:31.835 --> 01:34:33.115]  Caprende crew?
[01:34:34.053 --> 01:34:34.533]  Producers?
[01:34:34.553 --> 01:34:36.395]  Alright, you heard that?
[01:34:37.275 --> 01:34:41.518]  I know we gotta organize everything else out there, but I want him on the show.
[01:34:42.579 --> 01:34:45.280]  And you can say he's brash, you can say he's mean, but here's the deal.
[01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:50.684]  I don't hate an adult that's transgender, but I don't endorse it being pushed in society and culture against children.
[01:34:52.025 --> 01:34:56.229]  But also then support what he's saying, and that it's his free speech.
[01:34:56.869 --> 01:35:05.557]  And this is the attitude when you get up there as a fighter, who's the middleweight heavyweight champion, and these leftists bring up to him about, oh, your stance on the family.
[01:35:05.897 --> 01:35:07.278]  Our families are under attack.
[01:35:07.778 --> 01:35:08.939]  It isn't about gay marriage.
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:10.621]  They want to control our lives.
[01:35:11.141 --> 01:35:11.782]  It's a fact.
[01:35:12.242 --> 01:35:12.863]  It's a cult.
[01:35:13.563 --> 01:35:14.864]  We're going to recruit your children.
[01:35:15.105 --> 01:35:16.105]  We're going to get your children.
[01:35:16.145 --> 01:35:17.567]  This is a sick cult.
[01:35:18.936 --> 01:35:26.515]  So I think President Trump should pick Sean Strickland, UFC middleweight champion, as his VP.
[01:35:29.091 --> 01:35:31.713]  Uh, we've got a pretty supportive gay and lesbian community in this city.
[01:35:31.833 --> 01:35:33.855]  I did want to ask you about something you wrote a couple of years ago.
[01:35:33.915 --> 01:35:40.000]  You said, if I had a gay son, I would think I'd... Oh, look, another, another... I'm standing in a swamp, you guys, a swamp!
[01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:43.183]  You've become a champion, you've become a star, and someone's... Let me ask you something.
[01:35:43.203 --> 01:35:44.624]  Are you, are you, are you gay?
[01:35:44.644 --> 01:35:48.387]  I've never had the chance to come back with a more diverse... Are you, let me know, are you gay?
[01:35:48.407 --> 01:35:49.268]  Can I hear, can I get an answer?
[01:35:49.288 --> 01:35:51.870]  Well, no, I'm asking, this is a part of, are you, are you a gay man?
[01:35:52.010 --> 01:35:53.111]  I'm an ally of the community.
[01:35:53.411 --> 01:35:53.711]  Okay.
[01:35:54.151 --> 01:35:59.173]  If you had a son and he was like, you know, you had a son, he was gay, you'd be like, oh man, you don't, you don't want a grandkid?
[01:35:59.193 --> 01:35:59.714]  No problem with it.
[01:36:00.134 --> 01:36:02.515]  Oh man, well you, dude, you're a weak f***ing man, dude.
[01:36:02.555 --> 01:36:04.655]  You're like, you're part of the f***ing problem.
[01:36:04.696 --> 01:36:10.818]  You elected Justin Trudeau, like, when you f***ing, when he seized the bank accounts, like, you're just f***ing pathetic.
[01:36:11.829 --> 01:36:19.818]  And the fact that you have no f***ing backbone, and has he shut down your f***ing country and seized bank accounts?
[01:36:20.098 --> 01:36:21.720]  You ask me some stupid s*** like that?
[01:36:21.740 --> 01:36:22.841]  Go f*** yourself.
[01:36:22.901 --> 01:36:24.142]  Move the f*** on, man.
[01:36:23.962 --> 01:36:27.462]   that doesn't f*cking answer the question, but I did want to ask also things you said about the trans community.
[01:36:27.462 --> 01:36:30.662]   You said, uh, this past October when they announced the Bud Light sponsorship that
[01:36:30.662 --> 01:36:34.462]   you'd go so hard on Bud Light in your next fight, they'll have to accept me or denounce me
[01:36:34.462 --> 01:36:37.462]   when, uh, when they know what, and will know what they stand for.
[01:36:37.513 --> 01:36:40.374]  This guy's like, this Canadian's not that Canadian.
[01:36:40.474 --> 01:36:42.375]  Are you still going to use your fight time to kind of speak on that?
[01:36:42.495 --> 01:36:43.675]  Here's the thing about Bud Light.
[01:36:43.695 --> 01:36:47.437]  Here's the thing about Bud Light.
[01:36:50.078 --> 01:36:52.079]  Ten years ago, to be trans was a what?
[01:36:52.239 --> 01:36:53.539]  A mental f***ing illness.
[01:36:53.759 --> 01:37:02.067]   And now all of a sudden, people like you have f***ing weaseled your way into the world You are, you are an infection.
[01:37:03.008 --> 01:37:06.010]  You are the definition of weakness.
[01:37:06.231 --> 01:37:09.834]  Everything that is wrong with the world is because of f**king you.
[01:37:10.554 --> 01:37:13.237]  And the best thing is, is the world's not buying it.
[01:37:13.417 --> 01:37:16.459]  The world's not buying your f**king bulls**t, your f**king peddling.
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:18.481]  The world is not saying, you know what?
[01:37:18.982 --> 01:37:21.083]  You're right, f**king chicks have dicks.
[01:37:21.123 --> 01:37:22.084]  The world's not saying that.
[01:37:22.104 --> 01:37:23.906]  The world's saying, no, there are two genders.
[01:37:24.810 --> 01:37:28.612]  I don't want my kids being taught about, you know, who they can f***ing school.
[01:37:28.712 --> 01:37:32.635]  I don't want my kids being taught about, you know, their sexual preference.
[01:37:33.175 --> 01:37:35.316]  Like, dude, this guy is the f***ing enemy.
[01:37:35.877 --> 01:37:38.338]  You want to look at the f***ing enemy to our world?
[01:37:38.839 --> 01:37:41.460]  It's that motherf***er right there.
[01:37:42.221 --> 01:37:47.364]  Well, I'm officially endorsing Sean Strickland for the Vice President of the United States.
[01:37:52.239 --> 01:37:59.422]  But if you wanna find hell with me, I'm gonna show you what it's like.
[01:37:59.482 --> 01:38:01.022]  Till you're bleeding.
[01:38:01.062 --> 01:38:02.823]  Till you're bleeding.
[01:38:02.943 --> 01:38:08.145]  I'm not about to see your life.
[01:38:08.125 --> 01:38:19.125]   But if you wanna find hell with me, I'm gonna show you what it's like
[01:38:19.125 --> 01:38:24.125]   Everything they've done to crush us has only made us stronger
[01:38:24.199 --> 01:38:33.968]  As Nietzsche said, that which does not kill us only makes us stronger!
[01:38:35.229 --> 01:38:38.152]  They fear our spirit.
[01:38:39.613 --> 01:38:40.674]  They are scum.
[01:38:42.256 --> 01:38:56.576]  And we will win.
[01:38:56.609 --> 01:38:57.770]  We know how to beat them.
[01:38:58.371 --> 01:39:02.974]  When I tell you I got their number, when I tell you I got the cut of their jib.
[01:39:03.948 --> 01:39:05.829]  I know how to beat these people and so do you.
[01:39:06.250 --> 01:39:07.991]  And the number one thing is getting close to God.
[01:39:07.811 --> 01:39:14.081]   The number one number two thing is getting informed and independent and not submitting to this tyranny and breaking
[01:39:14.081 --> 01:39:19.391]   their will and just Laughing at him and saying screw you and your control screw
[01:39:19.391 --> 01:39:24.771]   your WF screw your New World Order Screw your Satan burn in hell
[01:39:24.771 --> 01:39:34.141]   All right We got Avi you many joining us an incredible reporter on
[01:39:34.141 --> 01:39:38.371]   the ground at Davos Coming up next segment
[01:39:37.557 --> 01:39:38.438]  But I mentioned this.
[01:39:40.199 --> 01:39:51.725]  What the Democrats do is they have their people support race war and communism and collapse borders, and then they'll have their governors or their presidents come out and call for unity and say they're against it.
[01:39:51.765 --> 01:39:52.846]  Here's a perfect example.
[01:39:53.246 --> 01:39:59.530]  The American psycho, who I know behind the scenes, I'm not at liberty to say, is a pathetic coward.
[01:40:01.707 --> 01:40:05.228]  He calls up these big talk show hosts and begs them not to be mean.
[01:40:05.588 --> 01:40:11.650]  One time I was there at dinner, just like three, four months ago, with a major talk show host, as big as they get.
[01:40:12.570 --> 01:40:14.050]  Not many to choose from, is there?
[01:40:15.251 --> 01:40:24.513]  And the son of a bitch called up, and he's on the phone with him, and he hangs up and he goes, don't tell anybody my name, don't say who did this, but he was just begging me to be nice to him.
[01:40:24.853 --> 01:40:27.834]  That's how pathetic this maggot is.
[01:40:29.758 --> 01:40:35.187]  I'm talking about American Psycho 2.0, Patrick Bateman 2.0, Gavin Newsom.
[01:40:36.850 --> 01:40:42.138]  And Gavin Newsom said, oh well they got the votes in the legislature to ban football.
[01:40:43.188 --> 01:40:44.309]  Because somebody might get hurt.
[01:40:44.830 --> 01:40:47.052]  If you don't get hurt, you'll get hurt way worse.
[01:40:47.913 --> 01:40:49.796]  Best thing I ever did was play football.
[01:40:50.216 --> 01:40:52.379]  Best thing I ever did was get attacked by bullies.
[01:40:52.659 --> 01:40:53.300]  Made me a man.
[01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:54.921]  Yeah, the world's rough.
[01:40:55.202 --> 01:40:56.483]  That's why I want self-driving cars.
[01:40:56.523 --> 01:40:57.224]  Somebody might get hurt.
[01:40:57.504 --> 01:40:59.427]  You're gonna get really hurt if you don't run your life.
[01:41:01.749 --> 01:41:03.932]  That which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[01:41:05.239 --> 01:41:06.000]  It's totally true.
[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:21.169]  Anybody telling you they want to take the danger out of your life and get rid of the slides at the pool and, you know, get rid of everything fun because it might hurt you because they want you a degenerate, weak, domesticated piece of crap.
[01:41:21.810 --> 01:41:24.331]  Newsome blocks attempt by far-left legislator.
[01:41:26.593 --> 01:41:27.553]  Why do you have to veto it then?
[01:41:27.613 --> 01:41:30.755]  It was the majority that got the votes to ban youth football.
[01:41:32.456 --> 01:41:34.378]  I'm all against obsessing on the NFL.
[01:41:35.330 --> 01:41:37.254]  I'm all for putting your kids in football.
[01:41:38.275 --> 01:41:39.097]  Yeah, they can get hurt.
[01:41:39.598 --> 01:41:42.282]  They can get hurt a lot worse not getting in the game.
[01:41:42.823 --> 01:41:44.867]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's happening.
[01:41:45.328 --> 01:41:48.554]  Two years in the making and we didn't plan it like this because we didn't know.
[01:41:49.358 --> 01:41:57.523]  To release Alex Jones New World Order Wars that's all about fighting Epstein and Clinton and Hillary and the Deep State and the pedo-rigs.
[01:41:57.643 --> 01:42:01.805]  Whole levels just dealing with that because that's the truth of how they operate.
[01:42:02.085 --> 01:42:06.988]  And now the game went on Steam, the biggest online platform of video games in the world.
[01:42:07.008 --> 01:42:11.310]  150 million users a week and it already shot to number one.
[01:42:11.571 --> 01:42:20.216]   So find the link to Steam at AlexJonesGame.com or search Alex Jones New World Order Wars Get it at Steam and get it for yourself.
[01:42:20.416 --> 01:42:24.859]  It's got an incredible 97% reviews.
[01:42:25.079 --> 01:42:29.162]  We'll put the link to Steam on screen and to AlexJonesGame.com.
[01:42:29.542 --> 01:42:29.862]  Get it.
[01:42:30.643 --> 01:42:32.004]  We are taking back the culture.
[01:42:32.044 --> 01:42:33.064]  We are taking things back.
[01:42:33.385 --> 01:42:36.166]  This will fund the Info War going into the election in the next 10 months.
[01:42:36.607 --> 01:42:38.308]  The only way we fail is if we don't take action.
[01:42:38.368 --> 01:42:41.090]  Get New World Order Wars by Alex Jones now!
[01:42:42.401 --> 01:42:57.944]  Who knows what their internal numbers are, but as far as we can pull together, the psychos at Davos 2024 are gleefully celebrating their victorious genocide of 17 million people from their poisonous jabs with far more in their sights.
[01:42:58.144 --> 01:43:09.846]  The unelected so-called health experts at Davos 2024 are now prioritizing Disease X, the final solution to solidify New World Order domination.
[01:43:10.146 --> 01:43:11.127]  How did we get here?
[01:43:11.367 --> 01:43:13.968]  It began with utilizing COVID hysteria.
[01:43:14.108 --> 01:43:23.194]  Dr. Fauci blew up the age-old regulatory process for testing new vaccines in order to bring in a host of DNA altering technology.
[01:43:23.394 --> 01:43:26.816]  COVID has since been proven to have been created in a lab.
[01:43:27.056 --> 01:43:30.158]  Disease X is lab driven from the outset.
[01:43:30.337 --> 01:43:37.016]   Decades of researching human genes and mice and other animals and the discovery of ancient diseases have resulted
[01:43:37.016 --> 01:43:41.867]   in the world economic forum nonchalantly predicting that disease X with
[01:43:41.867 --> 01:43:45.957]   a 100% kill rate could spread across the world in as little
[01:43:45.957 --> 01:43:54.577]   as 36 hours killing upwards of 80 million people Research has been ongoing at the UK's high security state-of-the-art
[01:43:54.577 --> 01:44:01.176]   facility in Porton down where a threat list grows of animal viruses capable of infecting humans.
[01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:07.163]  Meanwhile, the United States Congress is pushing the bio-research bill H.R.
[01:44:07.183 --> 01:44:08.503]  3832 to further U.S.
[01:44:08.624 --> 01:44:15.887]  labs' research of disease X. Disease X represents far more than a pandemic of untold mass death.
[01:44:15.987 --> 01:44:20.909]  Disease X allows the pharma billionaires behind it to become trillionaires.
[01:44:21.429 --> 01:44:27.071]  Now, Disease X, I've been teaching this sort of thing pretty well full-time since 1990.
[01:44:30.012 --> 01:44:42.948]  And, um, I'd never heard of this disease, X, so I looked at some of my books, because when I wrote my book, I couldn't remember putting it in, so it wasn't in there, but so it must be a new disease.
[01:44:43.709 --> 01:44:46.893]  It's a virus we don't know yet, but we do know it's out there.
[01:44:47.682 --> 01:45:03.768]  But the video I was doing yesterday was examining a particular virus that was experimentally used to infect mice, caused a disease of the brain, and at the end of the study, none of the mice at the end of the study were alive anymore.
[01:45:04.348 --> 01:45:12.836]   And that virus, my understanding from reading of the paper, was it had been, it evolved in cell cultures in a
[01:45:12.836 --> 01:45:13.657]  laboratory.
[01:45:13.657 --> 01:45:19.737]   So as a result of going through cell cultures in a laboratory, the function of the virus
[01:45:19.737 --> 01:45:22.176]  had been increased.
[01:45:22.176 --> 01:45:25.016]  So is the next pandemic really preventable?
[01:45:25.016 --> 01:45:33.457]   Funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation supported CEPI to invest 1.2 million in a startup
[01:45:33.457 --> 01:45:40.257]   to create under the tongue vaccine wafers for needle free vaccines against disease X,
[01:45:40.257 --> 01:45:46.936]   while simultaneously allowing the World Health Organization's pandemic treaty to reach into sovereign nations
[01:45:46.936 --> 01:45:48.695]  and bypass their governments.
[01:45:48.883 --> 01:45:58.350]  A policy-shifting Trojan horse that was rehearsed at the Clade X tabletop exercise by the Johns Hopkins Center in Washington, D.C.
[01:45:58.450 --> 01:45:58.850]  in 2018.
[01:45:59.110 --> 01:46:04.414]  The World Health Organization estimates that 150 million people have died.
[01:46:04.914 --> 01:46:07.796]  That's approximately 2% of the global population.
[01:46:08.156 --> 01:46:14.141]  In the U.S., there have been an estimated 82 million severe cases and 15 million deaths.
[01:46:14.881 --> 01:46:20.106]  At least 5 million Cladex deaths happened because adequate medical care wasn't available.
[01:46:20.566 --> 01:46:23.209]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 90%.
[01:46:24.190 --> 01:46:25.972]  The GDP down 50%.
[01:46:26.792 --> 01:46:31.457]  It was only by nationalizing the healthcare system that basic medical care is still available.
[01:46:32.017 --> 01:46:36.382]  The government now pays for, controls, and rations all medical care.
[01:46:36.542 --> 01:46:38.544]  The president remains in critical condition.
[01:46:39.084 --> 01:46:45.250]  And, while the vice president is out of intensive care, he remains unable to assume his constitutional duties.
[01:46:45.791 --> 01:46:46.612]  One-third of the U.S.
[01:46:46.652 --> 01:46:48.894]  Congress is dead or incapacitated.
[01:46:49.274 --> 01:46:51.256]  What if years go by without a vaccine?
[01:46:51.877 --> 01:46:57.422]  Then, experts tell us that we could eventually see 30 to 40 million deaths in the U.S.
[01:46:57.923 --> 01:47:02.947]  and more than 900 million around the world, 12% of the global population.
[01:47:03.228 --> 01:47:15.099]  As the Exposé reported, Playdex is said to have illustrated high-level strategic decisions and policies needed to prevent a severe pandemic or diminish its consequences should prevention fail.
[01:47:15.299 --> 01:47:18.341]  Rebel News reporter Avi Yamini is on the line from Davos, but he's trying to fix his audio.
[01:47:18.161 --> 01:47:24.161]   levels of US government as well as members of the global policy and preparedness community
[01:47:24.161 --> 01:47:25.960]  and the general public.
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:30.840]   Disease X is coming, but it isn't some chaotic pandemic we must manage.
[01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:36.039]   It is a genocidal kill weapon agreed upon by the worst members of humanity.
[01:47:36.039 --> 01:47:39.320]  John Bowne reporting.
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:43.680]   Rebel News reporter Avi Yamini is on the line from Davos, but he's trying to fix his audio.
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:46.240]  We'll get to him in a moment.
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:50.320]   Please remember ladies and gentlemen as we start hour three here that it's not like we're
[01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:54.360]   up here asking for your support promising you deliberate victory.

[01:48:30.141 --> 01:48:31.082]  X2 is almost sold out.
[01:48:31.122 --> 01:48:31.682]  Still discounting.

[01:48:52.929 --> 01:48:54.329]  InfoWarStore.com.

[01:49:00.610 --> 01:49:02.451]  We're up against the deep state.
[01:49:07.054 --> 01:49:10.436]  So here we are, in the fight, having massive effect.

[01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:24.683]  And the globalists are coming to shut off your power, your resources, to create racial division, total war.
[01:49:25.606 --> 01:49:29.348]  But we're fighting against it and we're so close to defeating this group.
[01:49:29.388 --> 01:49:35.491]  And just like we beat Hitler or the Soviet Union, it doesn't mean I'm offering some utopia once we've beaten this group of evil.
[01:49:35.531 --> 01:49:39.993]  But this is the big evil, our generation's evil, coming down on us now.
[01:49:40.033 --> 01:49:52.659]  So please, go to infowarestore.com right now, get a copy of The Great Awakening, get Winter Sun, the highest quality D3, organic out of the dung, to boost your immune system, the number one cause of viral spread.

[01:50:12.912 --> 01:50:17.774]  And if just 1% would buy the products, we could expand and do incredible things.
[01:50:17.854 --> 01:50:19.895]  I had Ezra Levant, the head of Rebel Media on here yesterday.
[01:50:20.275 --> 01:50:21.195]  He said, why aren't you here?
[01:50:21.696 --> 01:50:22.316]  Don't have the funds.
[01:50:22.336 --> 01:50:24.217]  Don't have the funds to be at the border.
[01:50:25.437 --> 01:50:26.678]  But that's what it's all about.
[01:50:26.818 --> 01:50:27.678]  Please support us.
[01:50:28.038 --> 01:50:30.800]  Please take action now at infowarestore.com.
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:31.660]  All right.
[01:50:33.471 --> 01:50:36.915]  I mean, he's a former soldier, reporter.
[01:50:37.215 --> 01:50:38.336]  He's a hard guy to get on.
[01:50:38.396 --> 01:50:39.237]  He's so busy.
[01:50:39.698 --> 01:50:46.005]  He does such a great job exposing tyranny, not just here, but around the world.
[01:50:48.695 --> 01:50:56.359]  Avi Shalom Yamini is an Australian right-wing political activist, commentator, internet personality from the Australian Jewish community.
[01:50:57.080 --> 01:51:04.804]  On the 4th of March 2018, Yamini was announced as a member of the Australian Liberty Alliance to run as a Victorian candidate for the Upper House.
[01:51:05.243 --> 01:51:09.323]   He's written for the Times of Israel, appeared on numerous Australian television shows,
[01:51:09.323 --> 01:51:11.683]  including the Project Sunrise.
[01:51:11.683 --> 01:51:17.903]   And today, 2019, Yamini founded the line of Israel Defense Force IDF training gyms
[01:51:17.903 --> 01:51:19.203]  in Melbourne, Victoria.
[01:51:19.203 --> 01:51:23.762]   He's also the founder of JSAFE, a Jewish community group established in 2016,
[01:51:23.762 --> 01:51:29.723]   and responds to the growing number of home invasions of caliphate and surrounding areas.
[01:51:29.723 --> 01:51:35.243]   Yamini works independently and creates video content online, wefreports.com.
[01:51:35.243 --> 01:51:40.523]   And I'm so proud to stand with a God-loving, conservative, anti-globalist Jew,
[01:51:40.523 --> 01:51:44.743]   and I'm so proud to stand with him against all the anti-Semites that attack us
[01:51:44.743 --> 01:51:46.543]  for not wanting to kill all the Jews.
[01:51:46.770 --> 01:51:53.253]  And he did a great job also exposing the head of the ADL that literally is there to create anti-Semitism to get more money.
[01:51:53.894 --> 01:51:54.874]  Just amazing work.
[01:51:54.894 --> 01:52:00.837]  But you have been knocking out of the park with Ezra O'Neill, another great human, another great Jew who we're proud to work with.
[01:52:00.857 --> 01:52:03.519]  And just incredible work there at Davos.
[01:52:03.579 --> 01:52:04.599]  So many confrontations.
[01:52:04.999 --> 01:52:06.040]  Avi, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:52:08.279 --> 01:52:10.279]  Thanks for having me, mate.
[01:52:10.279 --> 01:52:14.038]   Well, I'm going to try to give you the floor the next 15-20 minutes to break, because we've got a bunch of Klipscher
[01:52:14.038 --> 01:52:16.679]   confrontations, but you're right outside Davos. You've been there.
[01:52:16.679 --> 01:52:21.179]   It's like shooting fish in a barrel. All the craziness happening. Where do you want to start?
[01:52:21.179 --> 01:52:25.779]  Um, there's a lot happening.
[01:52:25.775 --> 01:52:28.856]  It's been three and a half days already.
[01:52:28.896 --> 01:52:31.497]  So, it started on – what day are we already?
[01:52:31.898 --> 01:52:33.678]  I've lost track.
[01:52:33.819 --> 01:52:35.920]  We're on Thursday, aren't we?
[01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:36.700]  Thursday.
[01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:48.546]  So, we had a full day Thursday, Wednesday, Tuesday and Monday night, just tracking down these people that have never faced any real questions from John Kerry.
[01:52:48.586 --> 01:52:49.606]  Let's start with John Kerry.
[01:52:49.646 --> 01:52:50.947]  That's making the rounds.
[01:52:51.527 --> 01:52:52.848]  I can see you bringing it up on the screen.
[01:52:54.343 --> 01:52:54.963]  Do you want to play it?
[01:52:55.523 --> 01:52:57.484]  We will in a moment.
[01:52:57.504 --> 01:52:58.485]  We played Kerry yesterday.
[01:52:58.525 --> 01:53:07.388]  I just want to talk to you about your experience fighting the globalists, what you're witnessing, and then you also bring it up to the ADL head because, you know, Jews are like anybody.
[01:53:07.428 --> 01:53:09.729]  There's conservatives, liberals, you know, people that don't care.
[01:53:10.369 --> 01:53:20.093]  But the whole big picture with all the university heads and the CIA and the media all anti-Jew now, what do you think the larger plan is with that?
[01:53:23.072 --> 01:53:23.732]  Yeah, it's pretty crazy.
[01:53:23.772 --> 01:53:31.197]  And I'll tell you a little secret to just keep it between you and me, Alex, is that you saw the first interaction I had with the ADL.
[01:53:31.777 --> 01:53:33.618]  We've since had another two.
[01:53:34.959 --> 01:53:45.085]  So we've got a very long, and I'll add to that, but as long as you promise to keep it between me and you, is that he even got physical.
[01:53:45.105 --> 01:53:46.345]  He grabbed our cameraman.
[01:53:46.385 --> 01:53:47.266]  He wasn't too happy.
[01:53:48.384 --> 01:53:57.270]  When I confronted him about exactly what you're saying, and that was my point, is that he's made anti-Semitism into a business.
[01:53:57.430 --> 01:53:59.492]  Are we saying that anti-Semitism doesn't exist?
[01:53:59.732 --> 01:54:08.538]  Absolutely it exists, in fact you can see it now more than ever, but I actually lay a lot of that blame at the ADL.
[01:54:08.558 --> 01:54:19.458]   I don't think they're the ones, they're not the ones putting the words in people's mouths, but what they've done is To the Jewish community, a massive disservice over years.
[01:54:20.058 --> 01:54:22.099]  They've alienated all our friends.
[01:54:23.300 --> 01:54:43.653]  You know, a great example is something like when they defamed and, you know, they created these lists of people that they claimed were Islamophobes for warning about ideologies and beliefs and communities and exactly what we're seeing unfold since October 7th.
[01:54:44.671 --> 01:55:05.933]  So they put all these people who were our friends, who were defending us, and some of those, even after being maligned and defamed and character assassinated and made it impossible to get employed after being labelled by the ADL, even after all that, they're still standing strong because they actually have a moral compass and they actually stand for what is right.
[01:55:07.234 --> 01:55:09.515]  Even when it's difficult.
[01:55:11.236 --> 01:55:26.143]  But what it proved is they were right the whole time, and the ADLs who pretended to fight anti-Semitism, and they do fight anti-Semitism, but they're not fighting it to fight anti-Semitism, they're fighting it because it's a business for them.
[01:55:26.896 --> 01:55:37.586]  And the thing, the sad fact is that now after October 7th, there is that massive spike in antisemitism and nobody really wants to hear that.
[01:55:38.066 --> 01:55:41.449]  In fact, I've always hated, you know, they made me hate the word.
[01:55:41.469 --> 01:55:50.858]  So I can only imagine somebody that's not personal, somebody that doesn't feel it, somebody that's... And we're going to show that green-black clip in a moment, our computer crash, but it's coming back up.
[01:55:50.898 --> 01:56:03.116]   But the reason I raise that is I sit there and watch every university head attacking Israel, all the CIA Deputy Director, and I'm not saying Israel is perfect, all these governments have got big problems.
[01:56:03.437 --> 01:56:04.197]  Absolutely not.
[01:56:05.077 --> 01:56:06.878]  Alex, I love Israel.
[01:56:07.378 --> 01:56:09.700]  I criticise the government, especially in COVID.
[01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:11.280]  They were outrageous.
[01:56:12.361 --> 01:56:13.361]  I love Australia.
[01:56:13.842 --> 01:56:16.043]  I criticise the government just as much.
[01:56:16.603 --> 01:56:19.844]  You can legitimately criticise policies of a government.
[01:56:19.964 --> 01:56:20.265]  No, I agree.
[01:56:20.285 --> 01:56:22.486]  So let me ask you the big question, because you're a smart guy and I respect you.
[01:56:23.473 --> 01:56:30.319]  Well, it's super in vogue, viral everywhere to say Jews run everything and they're the devil, and the very same liberal media is running that.
[01:56:30.379 --> 01:56:31.780]  What do you think the big picture is?
[01:56:32.101 --> 01:56:32.941]  Why are they doing that?
[01:56:32.961 --> 01:56:34.583]  Because it's outrageous.
[01:56:36.533 --> 01:56:39.694]  Look, I think there's different forces at play here.
[01:56:39.734 --> 01:56:43.196]  You've got everyone for their own reasons.
[01:56:43.236 --> 01:56:51.879]  I think you've got your far left, then you've got your, you know, the extreme fringe right, which has kind of grown sadly over the last few months.
[01:56:51.999 --> 01:56:53.639]  And then you've got obviously your Islamists.
[01:56:53.739 --> 01:56:59.762]  What you've got to remember is Jews make up what, 12, 14, I don't even know the numbers, it's tiny in the comparison.
[01:57:00.482 --> 01:57:02.823]  12 million in the world, 14 million somewhere along there.
[01:57:03.343 --> 01:57:09.188]  In the world, there's probably 70 religions in India that have more people than Jews.
[01:57:10.890 --> 01:57:26.003]  So I think what's happened since October 7th, you've seen this kind of unholy alliance between, you know, that fringe right, fringe left, and a big part of the Muslim world.
[01:57:26.716 --> 01:57:29.297]  And they're all saying the same thing kind of much.
[01:57:29.357 --> 01:57:34.639]  It's a very bizarre situation we're in and it's sad.
[01:57:36.340 --> 01:57:39.941]  Why do you think the head of the ADL is at Davos?
[01:57:41.822 --> 01:57:46.064]  Why do I think the head of the ADL is at Davos?
[01:57:46.344 --> 01:57:47.585]  Probably not just one reason.
[01:57:47.645 --> 01:57:51.766]  I think looking for funding, looking for connections.
[01:57:54.224 --> 01:57:55.885]  Take some orders, give some orders.
[01:57:55.905 --> 01:57:57.867]  I don't know, Alex.
[01:57:57.927 --> 01:58:04.953]  I tried to get to the bottom of it, but he got super defensive and tried to somehow turn it on me.
[01:58:04.993 --> 01:58:21.288]   And what I found interesting is one of his points that you'll see in the later videos is that, you know, I made the point to him that you've always targeted The right wing, the conservatives, anybody that basically didn't share your worldview.
[01:58:21.748 --> 01:58:26.512]  You labelled them a racist, an Islamophobic, an anti-Semite, whatever.
[01:58:27.472 --> 01:58:33.557]  And the problem is now, we fast forward to now and that's turned against us.
[01:58:33.617 --> 01:58:38.760]  And his defence was, well, haven't you seen that I actually have criticised the left?
[01:58:38.820 --> 01:58:41.362]  But he's only criticised the left when it comes to Israel.
[01:58:41.866 --> 01:58:54.075]  Which is the massive, the biggest disservice to us because it only proves our detractors point is that all he cares about is Jews and all that matters is Jews when it doesn't.
[01:58:54.556 --> 01:59:01.321]  In fact, anti-Semitism was always wrong and was always wrong from the left or the right prior to October 7th.
[01:59:02.222 --> 01:59:06.544]  Just some of us are brave enough to always call it out and I'm not talking about just Jews.
[01:59:06.564 --> 01:59:09.505]  I'm talking about, you know, my good friend Tommy Robinson.
[01:59:09.565 --> 01:59:21.571]  I've seen him over the years always standing up against, you know, I'm talking about the early days when one of his assault charges was literally hitting a Nazi that wouldn't leave his protest.
[01:59:22.351 --> 01:59:31.155]  And these are the people that got absolutely character assassinated by this ADL that pretended to fight for our community.
[01:59:31.235 --> 01:59:43.881]  And you talk about people that are just pro-peace and not anti-Israel, and by extension pro, going after Trump saying he's an anti-Semite ADL, going after me, preposterous, going after Elon Musk.
[01:59:44.701 --> 01:59:47.723]  I mean, literally, they don't spend any of their time on real people.
[01:59:48.163 --> 01:59:50.645]  They're literally saying kill all the Jews.
[01:59:50.805 --> 01:59:53.307]  He denies he really went after Elon Musk.
[01:59:53.407 --> 01:59:54.848]  I challenged him on Elon Musk.
[01:59:54.888 --> 01:59:57.169]  I didn't get a chance to challenge him about you.
[01:59:57.470 --> 01:59:58.790]  But Elon Musk, he denies it.
[01:59:58.850 --> 01:59:59.651]  He rewrites history.
[01:59:59.671 --> 02:00:04.855]  But this is the same guy that you will see in the video that we're keeping between us for now.
[02:00:05.175 --> 02:00:06.556]  Yeah, tell us, when is that coming out?
[02:00:06.576 --> 02:00:07.136]  When did this happen?
[02:00:08.962 --> 02:00:16.667]  It just happened, but it's because there was two interactions and we've got so much, so many videos and so many interactions.
[02:00:16.687 --> 02:00:17.928]  You don't have to tell me about it.
[02:00:17.948 --> 02:00:23.272]  You work all day, you work all day and you've got five hours of footage and you gotta, I get it, but it's coming out soon.
[02:00:23.993 --> 02:00:24.233]  Yeah.
[02:00:24.913 --> 02:00:32.136]  It's coming out soon and I want to get it out right because I think I want to explain to the audience what they're actually seeing.
[02:00:32.556 --> 02:00:39.118]  But to my point, he grabs the camera and then a second later he denies he grabbed it, even though we've got three cameras on it.
[02:00:39.178 --> 02:00:43.139]  This is the guy who wants to define what is true and not.
[02:00:44.159 --> 02:00:46.000]  So, yeah, that's where we're at.
[02:00:46.020 --> 02:00:48.881]  We've had a really good time here exposing these people.
[02:00:50.487 --> 02:01:00.371]  Since you bring it up, I want to play this one first, because I told listeners this last few years, I said, look, the ADL and Sasper Cohen literally saying Trump's Hitler and all this.
[02:01:01.331 --> 02:01:03.932]  Obviously, people love Trump, and they know that's not true.
[02:01:03.992 --> 02:01:07.633]  So it's going to discredit and the ADL saying we represent Jews.
[02:01:07.953 --> 02:01:09.354]  Well, I would hate any group up there.
[02:01:09.374 --> 02:01:11.595]  There was some weird group saying I represent Christians.
[02:01:12.055 --> 02:01:15.516]  And then they're saying, by the way, we don't like all these other groups.
[02:01:15.796 --> 02:01:17.617]  They're clearly trying to start a fight.
[02:01:18.297 --> 02:01:21.020]  To create pressure and then they get more donations.
[02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:23.923]  I mean, do you think that's kind of the baseline of what's happening here?
[02:01:24.958 --> 02:01:26.238]  It is his business.
[02:01:26.558 --> 02:01:27.499]  It is his business.
[02:01:27.599 --> 02:01:55.968]   You know, sometimes there are people within my community, sadly, that have monetised anti-Semitism and it's scary because, you know, they wake up every morning and if there isn't an anti-Semitic incident, they find something that's like... I feel like they go around, back in Australia at least, I feel like they were going around Sure, sure, but it's worse than that.
[02:01:56.449 --> 02:01:59.291]  Aren't they mainly leftists, though, getting money to do it?
[02:01:59.331 --> 02:02:00.352]  Absolutely.
[02:02:00.792 --> 02:02:09.739]  Yeah, so they're leftists demonizing their opposition as Nazis, and then meanwhile, allying with Hezbollah and Hamas and saying these giant violent protests attacking the White House are good.
[02:02:09.759 --> 02:02:16.884]  I mean, and I tell conservatives, as I say, that are getting roped into this anti-Israel thing, I go, wait a minute, you're now allied with Islamists?
[02:02:17.870 --> 02:02:20.291]  I mean that is... It's bizarre.
[02:02:20.311 --> 02:02:30.656]  It is the craziest thing watching so-called conservatives and libertarians and people who fight for freedom over COVID fighting for freedom and aligning themselves suddenly with Hamas and Hezbollah.
[02:02:31.476 --> 02:02:32.397]  Let me ask you this.
[02:02:32.417 --> 02:02:37.879]  Why do you think the Islamists, as we know they're good at conning people to be with them, why are they embracing the left?
[02:02:37.919 --> 02:02:39.060]  Why is the left embracing them?
[02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:41.381]  Because doesn't the left get Islam is using them?
[02:02:44.472 --> 02:02:47.053]  It is wild, and it's not only the left.
[02:02:47.393 --> 02:03:13.194]   You look on the right as well, you look at, I know you're friends with them, you look at Andrew Tate and you look at that whole new group that have kind of, I don't think they know the first thing about what they've joined, but they've joined it and now they're suddenly experts in the Middle East and they don't understand that really it's a war on our entire Free and democratic way of life, that's the thing.
[02:03:13.214 --> 02:03:18.786]  If Israel falls, what people need to understand is if Israel falls, America's next.
[02:03:19.756 --> 02:03:23.817]  Israel is the front line of that war of ideas.
[02:03:23.917 --> 02:03:24.818]  But let's go further.
[02:03:25.378 --> 02:03:27.558]  Israel has hundreds of nuclear weapons conservatively.
[02:03:27.658 --> 02:03:28.619]  Israel's not going to fall.
[02:03:29.099 --> 02:03:33.860]  So all these people saying to the mountain to the sea, it's a pipe dream.
[02:03:34.140 --> 02:03:34.901]  It's a delusion.
[02:03:35.021 --> 02:03:38.962]  And it becomes this, I cover any other issue, Russia, China, why are you attacking the Jews?
[02:03:39.302 --> 02:03:42.063]  It's a mental illness to just only focus on Israel.
[02:03:42.083 --> 02:03:42.863]  I'll be quite frank with you.
[02:03:44.549 --> 02:04:02.022]  I agree with you, and today I bumped into the head of Human Rights Watch, and I put the question to him, why is there a disproportionate, because from both sides, from everywhere, there is this obsession with Israel, when you look at the numbers, it should be insignificant.
[02:04:02.042 --> 02:04:23.056]   When you look at Yemen and some of the other wars in Syria, the conflict in Israel, between Israel and Hamas, should be insignificant, but somehow Everybody, even people who don't have political opinions about anything else, suddenly are experts.
[02:04:23.136 --> 02:04:24.497]  Israel's this tiny country.
[02:04:24.937 --> 02:04:26.719]  This isn't in defense of Israel, which I'd be proud to do.
[02:04:26.739 --> 02:04:27.820]  I think Israel would be destroyed.
[02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:32.484]  I have problems with Israel, but I have problems with my own government, as Avi said about his own, you know, Australia.
[02:04:33.837 --> 02:04:37.222]  All we're hearing from Harvard and the corporate press is Israel's bad.
[02:04:37.562 --> 02:04:40.146]  The establishment is attacking Israel, folks.
[02:04:40.486 --> 02:04:42.088]  That, to me, is a no-brainer.
[02:04:42.128 --> 02:04:43.130]  There's a set-up here.
[02:04:43.150 --> 02:04:44.652]  A. Do you agree with me?
[02:04:44.692 --> 02:04:45.513]  B. What is the set-up?
[02:04:47.776 --> 02:04:49.078]  I absolutely agree with you.
[02:04:49.158 --> 02:04:49.999]  And what's the set-up?
[02:04:50.663 --> 02:05:00.431]  Again, I think it's just different opportunists that have joined together for a common purpose and the purpose is to destroy Israel for their own specific interests.
[02:05:01.132 --> 02:05:03.033]  And it's not going to work.
[02:05:03.273 --> 02:05:04.574]  And they want that conflict.
[02:05:04.614 --> 02:05:06.096]  You know, some people just want World War Three.
[02:05:06.696 --> 02:05:08.836]  That's the thing, and that's where it could lead.
[02:05:09.076 --> 02:05:14.317]  By the way, Israel gets attacked for the Samson option, but it's following the U.S.
[02:05:14.337 --> 02:05:15.738]  thing of mutually assured destruction.
[02:05:16.098 --> 02:05:18.278]  If you nuke us or destroy us, we destroy you.
[02:05:18.698 --> 02:05:24.999]  So again, everybody that hates Israel for the Samson option, they learned it from the United States with mutually assured destruction.
[02:05:25.259 --> 02:05:30.240]  So let's explain to all the anti-Israel people, you don't get to do that, that's nuclear war.
[02:05:31.880 --> 02:05:33.481]  Yeah, agreed.
[02:05:35.456 --> 02:05:40.740]  If people are genuinely sympathetic to the Palestinian people, I'm with you.
[02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:56.410]  And what you've got to understand is I think the majority of Israelis, the vast majority of Israelis and Jews around the world, left and right, prior to October 7, were very, very sympathetic to the Palestinian people.
[02:05:57.062 --> 02:06:00.205]  The problem is, when you are governed on... The leaders!
[02:06:00.485 --> 02:06:07.291]  You know, you chose a government that was in the... Well, I love how Hamas's leaders don't live in the country.
[02:06:07.611 --> 02:06:40.630]   Don't live in the... No, they're in Qatar, and we're seeing a bunch of the Qataris here in the WEF, and that was another thing that stood out to me in the WEF, and it goes to your point, Alex, is that in the last three... I've attended the last three What we've seen over the last three forums is that Ukraine, you know, everything's been about Ukraine, supporting Ukraine.
[02:06:40.670 --> 02:06:42.930]  There's a Ukraine House and all these talks.
[02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:44.711]  In fact, Russia was banned.
[02:06:45.391 --> 02:06:46.031]  Russia's not here.
[02:06:46.071 --> 02:06:50.272]  Russia used to come to the West prior to the war.
[02:06:51.258 --> 02:06:54.480]  And it's kind of this thing, like you 100% have to support Ukraine.
[02:06:55.240 --> 02:07:29.837]   This year, after the attack on Israel, on Israeli civilians and Israel's retaliation, suddenly most of the talks in the WEF, they had the Israeli President today trying to defend himself, but most of the talks that you've seen around the conflict have been anti-Israel, have been pro-Palestinian, and What I don't understand is, so when the conflict broke out in Ukraine, the WEF, which it goes to what you were saying before, the establishment just supported the Ukrainian cause.
[02:07:31.187 --> 02:07:37.390]  Yeah, nobody can get around the establishment support of Ukraine.
[02:07:37.410 --> 02:07:42.771]  I'm not a Russophile, I'm not with Russia, but 100% it's pro-Russia, now it's 100% anti-Israel.
[02:07:43.112 --> 02:07:43.512]  Come on!
[02:07:43.732 --> 02:07:45.653]  I mean, like, something's going on here.
[02:07:46.013 --> 02:07:46.973]  That's all I'm telling people.
[02:07:47.013 --> 02:07:52.695]  Like, all the universities, the corporate media, it's all against Israel, it's all against Russia.
[02:07:52.775 --> 02:07:53.635]  What does that tell you?
[02:07:53.915 --> 02:07:55.036]  There's a larger plan here.
[02:07:57.392 --> 02:08:06.940]  And I knew it was going to happen on October 7th, so as I watched in horror, like most of the world, I knew we had a really short window.
[02:08:06.960 --> 02:08:31.017]   And I spoke to Ezra, the head of Rebel News, and I remember on the day speaking to him and saying, I think we have a window of two to three days where nobody in the world Can look at the images we're seeing and not be sympathetic to the civilians that have been butchered, raped, you know, the horrific scenes that we saw.
[02:08:31.878 --> 02:08:38.247]  So I knew we had a short window and I said, but after that window closes with Israel, it's going to be a really short window.
[02:08:38.847 --> 02:08:50.216]  After that window closes, the establishment's going to go into overdrive and the narrative is going to shift to Israel being the aggressor here in this situation.
[02:08:50.296 --> 02:09:01.564]  And as soon as they start defending themselves, because everybody loves, you know, everybody's okay with, everybody's sympathetic to dying Jews, but they don't support the Jews fighting back.
[02:09:01.604 --> 02:09:03.465]  You saw that in World War II, same thing.
[02:09:04.586 --> 02:09:06.728]  You know, everybody's sympathetic after the fact.
[02:09:07.468 --> 02:09:18.538]  And the establishment, they are only, so the Jewish state can only be losing and we're sad for them, or they're the oppressors.
[02:09:18.918 --> 02:09:22.601]  And we need to wipe these colonizers off the map.
[02:09:22.641 --> 02:09:28.486]  Well, it's just like Obama back to Arab Spring to overthrow pro-Western governments.
[02:09:28.506 --> 02:09:35.132]  There's a larger plan with Davos and the globalists working with Islam, because it is the biggest group in the world to take over.
[02:09:35.492 --> 02:09:37.492]  I want to come back with the ADL confrontation.
[02:09:37.492 --> 02:09:38.492]  I can't wait to see the new ones.
[02:09:38.492 --> 02:09:43.192]   I want to shift gears out of that Avi into what you're seeing at Davos, where you think
[02:09:43.192 --> 02:09:45.692]  Trump's going, the awakening, all these other issues.
[02:09:45.692 --> 02:09:53.331]   But absolutely, the establishment is pro-Palestine, pro-Muslim, and then they're bringing them
[02:09:54.036 --> 02:09:55.896]  You got Hezbollah and Hamas.
[02:09:56.376 --> 02:09:57.517]  And they got the borders wide open.
[02:09:57.537 --> 02:09:58.697]  There's a bigger plan here.
[02:09:59.017 --> 02:10:00.858]  And anybody not telling you that is an idiot.
[02:10:01.378 --> 02:10:01.698]  All right.
[02:10:01.978 --> 02:10:04.839]  You can find it all on Rebel News, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:04.859 --> 02:10:06.920]  You can find it all on their Twitter account.
[02:10:07.280 --> 02:10:09.240]  They also have the wefreports.com.
[02:10:09.780 --> 02:10:10.241]  Stay with us.
[02:10:10.261 --> 02:10:10.861]  We'll be right back.
[02:10:11.481 --> 02:10:15.602]  You know, I sit up here and I yell and scream about the New World Order and the globalists.
[02:10:15.622 --> 02:10:19.724]  They're planning to get rid of the borders and release a virus and have a global power grab.
[02:10:19.784 --> 02:10:20.764]  And you saw it all come true.
[02:10:21.943 --> 02:10:24.584]  But there's a inverse of that.
[02:10:25.324 --> 02:10:30.325]  There's not just the bad stuff I'm telling you about, there's the good stuff I'm telling you about.
[02:10:31.085 --> 02:10:35.707]  And just like our information is the best you're gonna find out there, our supplements are amazing.

[02:10:54.452 --> 02:10:58.914]  Now, in the time we have left, I can't tell you why they're so great and what they do for your body.
[02:10:59.335 --> 02:11:04.057]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com, look at the ingredients and investigate it, and then get them.
[02:11:04.357 --> 02:11:06.858]  It supports the InfoWar and it'll change your life.
[02:11:07.438 --> 02:11:09.199]  Take advantage now, InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:11:09.279 --> 02:11:23.169]   All right, I want to move out of the whole Israel discussion, get back to WF, but look, anybody that's really Looking at reality, we'll understand the establishment is being anti-Israel right now.
[02:11:23.189 --> 02:11:27.051]  And it doesn't mean Israel's perfect, none of these governments are, but what's going on here?
[02:11:28.632 --> 02:11:37.236]  The left sees giant third world populations and two billion Muslims, and they have the clergy plan for Europe and all the rest of it, and they say, we're allied with that.
[02:11:37.992 --> 02:11:43.155]  So there's big, powerful interests that want to use the third world against the first world.
[02:11:43.956 --> 02:11:48.018]  And as Avi said earlier, if Israel goes down, the U.S.
[02:11:48.078 --> 02:11:48.839]  is the next target.
[02:11:49.099 --> 02:11:56.644]  And I see all these right-wingers allied with orthodox, expansionary Islam right now, and it's disgusting and it's insane.
[02:11:56.924 --> 02:11:58.345]  And they don't want to have a discussion about that.
[02:11:59.185 --> 02:12:13.783]  They see themselves promoting corporate media, they see themselves doing all this, and they think, oh my god, the world's going to be fixed, you know, we're going to finally get rid of the Jews, and it's just bizarre that there's this larger evil force behind it manipulating it.
[02:12:13.843 --> 02:12:14.684]  Avi, do you agree with that?
[02:12:14.704 --> 02:12:15.645]  You want to comment to that?
[02:12:18.869 --> 02:12:20.570]  A hundred percent, mate.
[02:12:20.610 --> 02:12:22.131]  You've articulated it perfectly.
[02:12:22.571 --> 02:12:24.172]  I'm following it.
[02:12:24.272 --> 02:12:36.157]  And you know what, I'm grateful to hear somebody making sense on this issue finally, because it's been, since October 7th, watching some of the people that I did have a lot of respect for suddenly lose their minds as well.
[02:12:36.377 --> 02:12:39.919]  And for me, how that's happening is the bigger question.
[02:12:41.408 --> 02:12:51.804]  Well, since we mentioned it earlier, let's play the clip, and you've got new ones coming out, can't wait to see them, of the head of the ADL, where you politely talk to him, and he's so arrogant, he doesn't know what the boy-cried-wolf story is.
[02:12:52.144 --> 02:12:57.112]  No, that's a classic Globals response, he won't treat you like a human, he won't even respond to you, here it is.
[02:12:58.257 --> 02:12:59.178]  How you doing Jonathan?
[02:12:59.198 --> 02:12:59.879]  I'm good.
[02:12:59.979 --> 02:13:01.060]  Can I ask you something?
[02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:01.821]  I'm meeting somebody, I'm sorry.
[02:13:01.921 --> 02:13:02.581]  I'll walk with you.
[02:13:02.702 --> 02:13:05.184]  Are you, are you like that, the boy who cried wolf?
[02:13:05.564 --> 02:13:05.785]  Are you?
[02:13:05.805 --> 02:13:15.374]  For so many years you, you, you cried anti-Semitism and you found hatred everywhere and then, and then, and then finally, and then, I'll give you a minute from Rebel News.
[02:13:15.414 --> 02:13:16.075]  What's Rebel News?
[02:13:16.135 --> 02:13:16.515]  Rebel News.
[02:13:17.407 --> 02:13:26.119]  It doesn't matter, but finally now, when the world has turned so anti-semitic, no one believes us because of people like you and the work you've done over so many years.
[02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:31.085]  Destroying our allies, making lists about our allies, people that actually defend us.
[02:13:31.846 --> 02:13:34.009]  You've been a big part of that problem, haven't you?
[02:13:36.428 --> 02:13:37.728]  Do you know the boy that cried wolf?
[02:13:38.049 --> 02:13:39.149]  I'm not familiar with this story.
[02:13:39.189 --> 02:13:40.569]  Why don't you explain it to me?
[02:13:40.609 --> 02:13:47.472]  Jonathan, it's not a joke because the Jews around the world, we are feeling the pain and you've alienated so many of our allies.
[02:13:47.812 --> 02:13:48.772]  What about Elon Musk?
[02:13:49.132 --> 02:13:50.232]  Somebody that's been so good?
[02:13:50.933 --> 02:13:51.033]  No?
[02:13:51.053 --> 02:13:51.973]  You got a message for Elon?
[02:13:53.633 --> 02:13:54.354]  Thank you, Jonathan.
[02:13:55.094 --> 02:13:55.474]  There you go.
[02:13:56.094 --> 02:13:56.714]  Nothing to say.
[02:13:57.655 --> 02:13:58.815]  Censorship in real life.
[02:13:58.835 --> 02:14:01.236]  I bet you I'm going to be on a list tomorrow.
[02:14:02.452 --> 02:14:07.095]  Jonathan Grimblatt is a man that has cried anti-Semitism for years.
[02:14:07.275 --> 02:14:14.280]  He has found hate, he has made it his job to find hate and anti-Semitism and Jew hatred where it hasn't been.
[02:14:15.041 --> 02:14:30.632]  Now, the problem with that is, fast forward to October 7, where many of us Jews are finally seeing real anti-Semitism, but so much of the world is numb to it and don't believe it because he's cried it for so many years.
[02:14:31.192 --> 02:14:44.017]  The Jonathan Grimblatt of the world who label anyone with an opposing view as a racist and as anti-Semite and now suddenly in our darkest days we have no one left to support us.
[02:14:44.477 --> 02:14:45.397]  That is why we're here.
[02:14:45.818 --> 02:14:47.278]  WFReports.com.
[02:14:47.598 --> 02:14:49.339]  Bookmark and support our work.
[02:14:52.170 --> 02:14:53.271]  So I mean, that's really it.
[02:14:53.331 --> 02:14:53.971]  It's real simple.
[02:14:54.051 --> 02:15:05.016]  Big corporations, BlackRock, they just go hire a so-called Jewish organization to then demonize Elon Musk and Alex Jones and Donald Trump, who's like Trump's super friend of Israel.
[02:15:05.296 --> 02:15:10.018]  It's insane, but it's a powerful political attack.
[02:15:10.098 --> 02:15:12.499]  How do we counter that and then shift gears to other topics?
[02:15:16.751 --> 02:15:33.916]  Look, I think the truth comes out at the end and I think if we keep speaking the truth and people like you, you know, it's more important for people like you to speak out about it and to point to the truth than people like me, because people like me, it feels like maybe he's just a Jew.
[02:15:34.676 --> 02:15:36.257]  It's a bit like the Grimblats of this world.
[02:15:36.637 --> 02:15:37.897]  So I appreciate it, Alex.
[02:15:37.957 --> 02:15:43.759]  It's good on you for standing up for what's right, even in such a time where it's become so unpopular.
[02:15:44.457 --> 02:15:48.681]  Well, Avi, it's clearly a globalist operation against us all, so I'm standing up for everybody.
[02:15:48.701 --> 02:15:53.505]  I mean, I care about Jews and everybody else, but I mean, when the whole establishment's behind something, I'm against it.
[02:15:53.525 --> 02:15:55.307]  I mean, that's not rocket science.
[02:15:55.367 --> 02:15:59.210]  And I'm watching this happen, and it's really concerning.
[02:15:59.570 --> 02:16:00.651]  You confronted a lot of other people.
[02:16:00.732 --> 02:16:02.693]  I'll come back on when we have the full thing.
[02:16:05.796 --> 02:16:11.155]   I can promise you now, I think you'll enjoy that one a lot more than the short film.
[02:16:11.155 --> 02:16:15.155]   Give us a little, give us a prelude and I'll put it up front, we'll put this out on X.
[02:16:15.155 --> 02:16:18.195]  What, he just flipped out? Green, black, has the ADL?
[02:16:18.195 --> 02:16:24.916]   So I caught him, so basically the promenade here is about, I don't know, a kilometer and
[02:16:24.916 --> 02:16:26.756]  maybe even more.
[02:16:27.033 --> 02:16:32.176]  And I caught him at the end of it, so right outside Black Rock, which is at the bottom end of the promenade.
[02:16:32.696 --> 02:16:39.539]  And I basically said to him, listen, you have a chance to finally apologise to the Jewish community.
[02:16:39.639 --> 02:16:40.900]  I didn't give you the chance here today.
[02:16:41.480 --> 02:16:47.323]  And he ignored me for about a minute and then he snapped and it became, it was on.
[02:16:48.959 --> 02:16:52.861]  And, you know, he tried to defend himself and crash me out a little bit.
[02:16:53.401 --> 02:16:54.081]  You'll get to see it.
[02:16:54.842 --> 02:16:59.184]  And I think it's very telling, the video coming up.
[02:16:59.244 --> 02:17:04.427]  But I promise once we release it, I'll send it to you and I'll come back on and we can discuss it.
[02:17:04.447 --> 02:17:04.967]  Well, please do.
[02:17:04.987 --> 02:17:08.209]  You've got a few days left of this and I'm glad we covered this because...
[02:17:09.182 --> 02:17:13.883]  Uh, like you said, when the whole media supports Ukraine, I'm not even for Russia, I'm just like, what's going on?
[02:17:14.184 --> 02:17:21.886]  The whole media is anti-Israel, and then everybody's like acting like they're anti-establishment, being anti-Israel, plus it's not going anywhere, Israel has nuclear weapons.
[02:17:21.906 --> 02:17:24.867]  That's the most insane, most insane part.
[02:17:24.987 --> 02:17:28.348]  Everybody that's anti-establishment has just joined the establishment.
[02:17:29.795 --> 02:17:32.716]  Because there's 2 million Muslims and the establishment wants to team up with them.
[02:17:32.736 --> 02:17:33.737]  They think that's the winning hand.
[02:17:33.757 --> 02:17:35.197]  I mean, it's not rocket science, folks.
[02:17:35.757 --> 02:17:37.478]  America's 300 and something million people.
[02:17:37.878 --> 02:17:38.959]  Well, the Muslims are 2 billion.
[02:17:38.999 --> 02:17:41.380]  Israel's only like, you know, 20 million people or whatever it is.
[02:17:41.940 --> 02:17:43.681]  It's very easy.
[02:17:43.801 --> 02:17:44.881]  It's about 8 million.
[02:17:45.041 --> 02:17:45.702]  It's tiny.
[02:17:45.742 --> 02:17:46.702]  That's what people don't understand.
[02:17:47.022 --> 02:17:48.683]  You're talking about 8 million, not 20 million.
[02:17:48.703 --> 02:17:48.923]  8 million.
[02:17:49.103 --> 02:17:50.724]  I just meant pro-Israel outside.
[02:17:53.086 --> 02:17:54.126]  Sorry, what do you mean?
[02:17:54.166 --> 02:17:54.807]  I'm just guessing.
[02:17:54.827 --> 02:17:55.808]  I'm sure you know better numbers.
[02:17:56.048 --> 02:18:02.592]  When I said 20 million, I meant... Israel's 8 million, and even of that, only 20% of that's not even Jewish.
[02:18:03.313 --> 02:18:06.815]  So you're looking at about 6 million in Israel.
[02:18:07.396 --> 02:18:07.976]  Incredible.
[02:18:08.076 --> 02:18:09.677]  Well, what a dangerous moment in society.
[02:18:10.098 --> 02:18:11.579]  Other subjects, other topics.
[02:18:11.679 --> 02:18:15.962]  I mean, we've got... Are you guys confronting the CNN anchor?
[02:18:18.513 --> 02:18:20.154]  Yeah, that was great.
[02:18:20.194 --> 02:18:24.476]  No, I was going to say we're going to be put on an ADL list again if we talk about the Jews for too much longer.
[02:18:25.036 --> 02:18:25.556]  That's right.
[02:18:26.797 --> 02:18:34.420]  So, Ami, what about your talk with Richard Quest?
[02:18:34.680 --> 02:18:35.180]  You know what?
[02:18:35.480 --> 02:18:40.182]  It was fun because you just watch him.
[02:18:40.262 --> 02:18:42.303]  He's certainly a character.
[02:18:44.716 --> 02:19:04.258]  He tried to argue that he, you know, when we made the point, especially as Ezra was on fire on this one, making the point that how can you be, how can you be here as a critical, you know, to report on the WEF, which is the point that we've been trying to make over the last few years.
[02:19:04.278 --> 02:19:15.412]   You've got all the corporate media here, but they're not here To hold them accountable or ask, you know, the tough questions or even the simple questions that the average person has around the world.
[02:19:15.752 --> 02:19:25.178]  They're here to be part of the event and they spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to be a part of it and they get, which gives them access and they don't want to lose that access.
[02:19:25.318 --> 02:19:29.380]  And we basically put that to him in the walk-on and he tried to get away and he couldn't get away.
[02:19:29.480 --> 02:19:40.216]   And, um, and, and, and I think he essentially admits to, To the fact that, you know, yeah, he said he argues that he didn't, they don't buy the access.
[02:19:40.816 --> 02:19:46.238]  They buy everything else and the access comes as a bonus, which I don't know if it's any different.
[02:19:46.418 --> 02:19:49.198]  Well, the bottom line is people say identify the ruling elite.
[02:19:49.859 --> 02:19:53.320]  Black Rock, State Street and a few others control 88% of things.
[02:19:53.380 --> 02:19:55.200]  So this is who runs things.
[02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:57.041]  You're there actually confronting the ruling class.
[02:19:57.421 --> 02:20:04.063]  Here's a minion paying to be there, trying to act like he's, you know, fair, but here's the scrum.
[02:20:07.352 --> 02:20:09.614]  Absolutely, yep.
[02:20:09.654 --> 02:20:12.196]  Our computers are crashing so much, it drives me crazy.
[02:20:12.437 --> 02:20:15.159]  Can we play the clip, guys, of CNN anchor Richard Quest?
[02:20:15.519 --> 02:20:16.821]  Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.
[02:20:16.921 --> 02:20:25.729]  Pleasant at half past nine in the morning to be ambushed by one, two, three, four, five people.
[02:20:25.749 --> 02:20:25.909]  Five!
[02:20:26.249 --> 02:20:29.452]  I don't even deploy that many people when I'm going to interview a president.
[02:20:29.472 --> 02:20:32.034]  You've got that many people in the makeup room alone!
[02:20:36.553 --> 02:20:37.894]  I'd recognize that voice anywhere.
[02:20:37.934 --> 02:20:38.414]  How you doing?
[02:20:38.595 --> 02:20:38.875]  I'm sorry.
[02:20:38.895 --> 02:20:39.535]  Not this morning.
[02:20:39.575 --> 02:20:40.276]  What are you sorry about?
[02:20:40.556 --> 02:20:42.237]  Well, I'm sorry that I can't stop to talk to you.
[02:20:42.357 --> 02:20:42.898]  Let's not stop.
[02:20:42.918 --> 02:20:43.638]  Let's talk and walk.
[02:20:43.679 --> 02:20:44.899]  We've got 60 seconds.
[02:20:44.919 --> 02:20:47.281]  I've got one question for you I've been thinking about.
[02:20:47.842 --> 02:20:49.203]  CNN and yourself especially.
[02:20:49.223 --> 02:20:50.063]  A lot of credibility.
[02:20:50.083 --> 02:20:50.964]  A lot of reputation.
[02:20:51.545 --> 02:20:55.668]  But how can you ask critical questions here if you're paying to be here?
[02:20:56.068 --> 02:20:57.469]  Like, CNN pays to be here.
[02:20:57.509 --> 02:20:59.731]  So how can you critically ask questions about the WEF?
[02:21:00.111 --> 02:21:10.097]  I always find it's best to be very careful when walking, talking and doing interviews, particularly in snowy conditions, because I think... Now you're avoiding the question.
[02:21:10.117 --> 02:21:11.337]  I think it's because you're embarrassed.
[02:21:12.018 --> 02:21:17.241]  I think it's always very important to understand... Now we have two against one!
[02:21:17.901 --> 02:21:19.102]  I'm not against you, mate.
[02:21:19.142 --> 02:21:20.322]  We're all on the side of the truth.
[02:21:20.382 --> 02:21:20.943]  At least I am.
[02:21:20.983 --> 02:21:21.703]  I know you are too.
[02:21:21.743 --> 02:21:23.064]  Now let me ask you, do you ski?
[02:21:23.945 --> 02:21:26.247]  I have a better question that's more in the public interest.
[02:21:26.607 --> 02:21:33.632]  How can CNN report neutrally or objectively on the World Economic Forum if you're paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to be here?
[02:21:33.652 --> 02:21:34.712]  You're part of the insiders.
[02:21:37.554 --> 02:21:40.856]  We are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to be here.
[02:21:41.156 --> 02:21:42.377]  Precisely what do you mean?
[02:21:42.757 --> 02:21:50.441]  Well, to get access to the inside, CNN and the other regime media pay hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[02:21:50.461 --> 02:21:51.081]  The other, sorry?
[02:21:51.101 --> 02:21:52.102]  Regime media.
[02:21:52.182 --> 02:21:52.682]  Excuse me?
[02:21:53.222 --> 02:21:53.743]  Regime.
[02:21:53.843 --> 02:21:54.763]  R-E-G-I-M-E.
[02:21:54.783 --> 02:21:55.504]  Excuse me?
[02:21:55.524 --> 02:21:55.784]  Yes.
[02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:58.101]  My God, do you know?
[02:21:58.602 --> 02:22:00.203]  You are... This is fascinating.
[02:22:00.444 --> 02:22:02.065]  You're not doing very well as an answerer.
[02:22:02.085 --> 02:22:04.227]  You're good as an asker, but not as an answerer.
[02:22:04.247 --> 02:22:07.691]  You are buying more cameras to try and get me.
[02:22:07.711 --> 02:22:09.132]  I'm not trying to get your mates.
[02:22:09.192 --> 02:22:10.473]  I'm trying to get an answer from you.
[02:22:10.513 --> 02:22:10.954]  It's different.
[02:22:12.210 --> 02:22:12.790]  Lovely weather.
[02:22:13.230 --> 02:22:14.751]  Tell me, you've been here every single year.
[02:22:14.791 --> 02:22:15.872]  We bumped into you last year.
[02:22:16.812 --> 02:22:19.193]  This year the theme is regaining trust.
[02:22:19.313 --> 02:22:23.475]  Why do you think your lords here at WEF have lost so much trust?
[02:22:23.495 --> 02:22:23.695]  Stop it!
[02:22:23.855 --> 02:22:24.096]  Stop it!
[02:22:24.596 --> 02:22:30.238]  Rephrase the question in a neutral fashion and you might stand a chance of getting an answer.
[02:22:30.258 --> 02:22:31.139]  Like CNN does?
[02:22:33.015 --> 02:22:36.117]  You don't like it when it's... Listen, I think you're a great question asker.
[02:22:36.157 --> 02:22:36.677]  I watch you.
[02:22:36.717 --> 02:22:38.118]  I love your voice.
[02:22:38.218 --> 02:22:38.918]  Answer my questions.
[02:22:38.958 --> 02:22:39.659]  What's your purpose?
[02:22:39.979 --> 02:22:45.162]  My purpose is to find out how you can be an objective journalist but also pay to be part of the team.
[02:22:45.182 --> 02:22:46.903]  But you're assuming we pay to be part of the team.
[02:22:46.923 --> 02:22:48.084]  I know you do.
[02:22:48.604 --> 02:22:52.526]  All of these organizations along here pay an enormous amount of money to Klaus Schwab.
[02:22:52.546 --> 02:22:54.347]  And do you see us along here?
[02:22:54.547 --> 02:22:55.928]  No, you're in the inner sanctum.
[02:22:56.688 --> 02:23:00.331]  For which we pay for the facilities of studios... Sure.
[02:23:00.671 --> 02:23:02.332]  If that lets you sleep at night, mate...
[02:23:03.154 --> 02:23:04.876]  We pay for that in all sorts of venues.
[02:23:05.296 --> 02:23:05.656]  You know what?
[02:23:05.676 --> 02:23:06.477]  We pay for the facilities.
[02:23:06.577 --> 02:23:14.184]  And I assure you, sir, I assure you, the numbers you have for what we might pay for facilities, i.e.
[02:23:14.584 --> 02:23:16.746]  electricity, tables... And access.
[02:23:17.047 --> 02:23:17.227]  No.
[02:23:17.367 --> 02:23:19.088]  Hundreds of thousands of dollars for tables, sir.
[02:23:19.108 --> 02:23:20.109]  They're golden tables.
[02:23:20.349 --> 02:23:20.970]  Yes, yes.
[02:23:21.230 --> 02:23:22.692]  There is no payment for access.
[02:23:22.872 --> 02:23:26.055]  Let me just say this again, to be absolutely clear.
[02:23:26.255 --> 02:23:27.216]  The access is a bonus.
[02:23:27.816 --> 02:23:29.538]  The access is part of my job.
[02:23:30.771 --> 02:23:33.852]  And you would never jeopardize that by asking questions that are too prickly.
[02:23:34.032 --> 02:23:36.033]  Oh, you are clearly erroneous, sir.
[02:23:36.053 --> 02:23:38.414]  Show me a prickly question you've asked here at this place.
[02:23:38.934 --> 02:23:39.815]  You'd get booted out.
[02:23:40.235 --> 02:23:42.556]  Look at interviews with Klaus Schwab over the years.
[02:23:42.996 --> 02:23:44.957]  We have become too much pessimists.
[02:23:45.437 --> 02:23:55.861]  Look, humankind was driven, so was the paradigm, the narrative, to take care of the next generations, to take care of the neighbors.
[02:23:56.582 --> 02:23:59.803]  And we have lost this capability to a certain extent.
[02:24:00.043 --> 02:24:02.265]  How do we get that back?
[02:24:03.245 --> 02:24:05.647]  Looks the world is also full of opportunities.
[02:24:06.128 --> 02:24:16.515]  My questioning of Klaus Schwab has been over the years some of the more difficult and, if you will, uncomfortable for Wes.
[02:24:16.715 --> 02:24:17.336]  I don't believe that.
[02:24:17.356 --> 02:24:24.241]  World Economic Forum's theme this year, Rebuilding Trust, where it aims to hit the target.
[02:24:24.921 --> 02:24:28.304]  That's also the philosophy of the Davos Curling Club.
[02:24:29.218 --> 02:24:34.104]  So when the skip says, here, you make the curl like that.
[02:24:34.625 --> 02:24:36.267]  So that's why it's called curling.
[02:24:36.287 --> 02:24:37.128]  Because you curl.
[02:24:37.188 --> 02:24:38.069]  It curls.
[02:24:38.690 --> 02:24:39.311]  It curls.
[02:24:39.411 --> 02:24:39.611]  Yes.
[02:24:40.513 --> 02:24:41.574]  Look at what I say about Ref.
[02:24:41.594 --> 02:24:43.076]  Look at the articles I've written about Ref.
[02:24:43.356 --> 02:24:46.040]  I say basically, my fundamental view on Ref...
[02:24:46.778 --> 02:24:46.998]  Yes.
[02:24:47.078 --> 02:24:48.799]  A lot of what happens here is a waste of time.
[02:24:49.080 --> 02:24:50.520]  A lot of it is far too expensive.
[02:24:50.721 --> 02:24:56.884]  But there is real value in people coming together at the beginning of the year to see where they stand on controversial or political issues.
[02:24:56.904 --> 02:25:02.128]  With no democratic oversight, no opposition party, and no independent journalists.
[02:25:02.508 --> 02:25:04.009]  It is a crypto government.
[02:25:04.029 --> 02:25:06.551]  It's a lobbyist festival.
[02:25:06.911 --> 02:25:08.432]  It's unregistered lobbyists.
[02:25:08.912 --> 02:25:09.873]  You get away with things.
[02:25:09.973 --> 02:25:10.153]  Right.
[02:25:10.413 --> 02:25:11.654]  You have now transgressed.
[02:25:12.014 --> 02:25:14.375]  You have followed me for the last however many minutes.
[02:25:14.655 --> 02:25:17.016]  I've made it clear I didn't particularly want to be interviewed.
[02:25:17.056 --> 02:25:18.016]  I've given you some answers.
[02:25:18.336 --> 02:25:19.277]  Now will you let me proceed?
[02:25:19.297 --> 02:25:20.757]  You have to be in your safe space.
[02:25:20.777 --> 02:25:23.959]  You're about to go past the gate.
[02:25:24.099 --> 02:25:27.320]  Why do you think we don't get access but you do?
[02:25:27.540 --> 02:25:29.361]  I really love the fact.
[02:25:29.901 --> 02:25:30.541]  Really love it!
[02:25:31.102 --> 02:25:38.566]  That you will take whatever I say, in however I say it, and manage to turn it either... We've learned from the master!
[02:25:38.586 --> 02:25:41.207]  We've learned from the master!
[02:25:41.247 --> 02:25:41.967]  You're doing it now!
[02:25:42.208 --> 02:25:44.349]  And either turn it against me...
[02:25:45.587 --> 02:25:53.509]  Or against CNN, or against anybody else that you deem to be unworthy of your approval.
[02:25:53.689 --> 02:25:54.349]  Well done, sir.
[02:25:54.369 --> 02:25:55.790]  Go with the masters of the universe.
[02:25:55.890 --> 02:25:56.770]  Go with your people.
[02:25:57.150 --> 02:25:58.350]  Go to your people.
[02:25:58.370 --> 02:25:59.210]  Those are your people.
[02:25:59.230 --> 02:26:00.631]  I'm looking forward to seeing how you edit this.
[02:26:01.251 --> 02:26:02.271]  It'll be raw, my friend.
[02:26:02.291 --> 02:26:02.791]  Uncut.
[02:26:03.111 --> 02:26:03.471]  Excellent.
[02:26:03.691 --> 02:26:14.474]  In which case, you will fully understand it's not particularly pleasant at half past nine in the morning to be ambushed by one, two, three, four, five...
[02:26:16.565 --> 02:26:19.947]  I don't even deploy that many people when I'm going to interview a president!
[02:26:19.987 --> 02:26:22.349]  You've got that many people in the makeup room alone!
[02:26:22.369 --> 02:26:25.390]  There's many criminals here we would love to hold accountable.
[02:26:26.031 --> 02:26:27.672]  And I think CNN often... VIP alert!
[02:26:27.872 --> 02:26:28.973]  VIP coming through!
[02:26:29.033 --> 02:26:29.773]  Clear the way!
[02:26:29.873 --> 02:26:30.714]  ...supports it.
[02:26:30.734 --> 02:26:34.256]  CNN often is the one that props these criminals up.
[02:26:34.296 --> 02:26:35.176]  I wouldn't call him a criminal.
[02:26:35.196 --> 02:26:36.037]  I'm not going to call him a criminal.
[02:26:36.057 --> 02:26:36.817]  Listen, he's... Not him!
[02:26:36.857 --> 02:26:37.077]  Not him!
[02:26:37.158 --> 02:26:37.418]  I'm saying...
[02:26:38.158 --> 02:26:40.480]  Who's a prop up here?
[02:26:40.840 --> 02:26:44.162]  He's a journalist, so when he has questions to ask, you know it.
[02:26:44.482 --> 02:26:46.304]  He'll ask tough questions when he wants to.
[02:26:46.824 --> 02:26:50.146]  But he won't ask tough questions in there, because you have to be part of the club.
[02:26:50.466 --> 02:26:53.248]  And if you stink up the joint, you won't be allowed back in.
[02:26:53.288 --> 02:26:56.650]  We know that, because one of our colleagues was accredited last year.
[02:26:56.991 --> 02:26:58.752]  He was blackballed this year.
[02:26:59.152 --> 02:27:01.774]  And I think we cut him to the quick.
[02:27:01.794 --> 02:27:07.618]  I think he was very thin-skinned, which is unusual for him, because I think we were getting a little too close to the truth.
[02:27:08.232 --> 02:27:10.873]  So, Richard Quest at least talked to you.
[02:27:10.973 --> 02:27:17.095]  Usually they say nothing, but I know Ezra predicted you guys were running him in the next 24 hours.
[02:27:17.135 --> 02:27:17.856]  You guys did.
[02:27:18.236 --> 02:27:20.196]  Who else have you guys confronted that isn't out yet?
[02:27:23.038 --> 02:27:29.620]  There is a massive list and it's about 10 to 9 and my mind's gone blank.
[02:27:29.660 --> 02:27:31.040]  Who have we got on our list?
[02:27:31.521 --> 02:27:32.281]  Give me some names.
[02:27:32.301 --> 02:27:33.461]  We've got Human Rights Watch.
[02:27:36.249 --> 02:27:39.391]  I had a quick one with Carmella Harris' husband.
[02:27:39.691 --> 02:27:40.832]  That's about to come out, eh?
[02:27:41.332 --> 02:27:42.653]  Nice, quick, juicy, fun one.
[02:27:42.673 --> 02:27:45.034]  Who else was there?
[02:27:45.054 --> 02:27:47.095]  There was that useless senator.
[02:27:47.755 --> 02:27:49.496]  There's a whole... Well, Abhi, you've done a great job.
[02:27:49.556 --> 02:27:51.497]  Join us again tomorrow as more unfolds.
[02:27:51.838 --> 02:27:53.238]  We've got a few minutes to break here.
[02:27:53.919 --> 02:27:56.280]  What else do you want to talk about witnessing the Globalists?
[02:27:56.300 --> 02:27:58.521]  You know, they talk about wanting to gain trust back.
[02:27:58.541 --> 02:28:00.943]  I think the biggest thing is they know the world knows.
[02:28:01.863 --> 02:28:07.884]  Penetrating the cabinets as Klaus Schwab said they're they're trying to set up their world government They seem to be on the defense at some level.
[02:28:07.904 --> 02:28:08.384]  What do you think?
[02:28:09.645 --> 02:28:23.527]  Absolutely, they are on the defense and that's why the you know a few years ago You would would have never most people didn't know what the WF was and now they're talking about regaining trust because they know they've lost that trust I don't think it's gonna work.
[02:28:23.928 --> 02:28:29.925]   I think people are finally waking up to the This dangerous, dangerous organization.
[02:28:30.485 --> 02:28:31.685]  Because they don't want people knowing the truth.
[02:28:31.504 --> 02:28:34.704]   clips yesterday, the head of the EU, all of them. The number one threat is this info
[02:28:34.704 --> 02:28:39.744]   silencing us. All you're doing is asking questions. Why are they so scared?
[02:28:39.744 --> 02:28:45.943]  Because they don't want people knowing the truth. That's it.
[02:28:45.943 --> 02:28:50.744]  Well I can't wait to see what else comes.
[02:28:48.796 --> 02:28:55.779]  We already had plenty yesterday, but you confronted John Kerry, Tedros, the head of the WHO, the Blackstone Group.
[02:28:55.799 --> 02:29:00.320]  I mean, you guys are knocking it out of the park.
[02:29:00.680 --> 02:29:02.041]  Yeah, there is a lot more to it.
[02:29:02.361 --> 02:29:04.562]  The viewers, head to WEFReports.com.
[02:29:04.582 --> 02:29:09.264]  I think every hour, or probably in the next few hours, we're going to have a new video up.
[02:29:10.393 --> 02:29:11.193]  Worth checking them out.
[02:29:11.493 --> 02:29:13.154]  Alright, well thank you for all the time.
[02:29:13.174 --> 02:29:15.295]  I didn't mean to spend too much time on the ADL.
[02:29:15.415 --> 02:29:18.055]  It's just that, yeah, it's so obvious what they're doing.
[02:29:18.355 --> 02:29:19.496]  A minute closing comment.
[02:29:19.776 --> 02:29:21.396]  We had to get it off our chest, Alex.
[02:29:21.937 --> 02:29:23.137]  We had to get that off our chest.
[02:29:23.157 --> 02:29:25.478]  But I know, I wasn't expecting to go on about that.
[02:29:26.838 --> 02:29:32.740]  But I'll make time and we'll spend some more time talking about the WEF in general over the next few days.
[02:29:33.380 --> 02:29:34.220]  Alright, talk to you soon.
[02:29:34.260 --> 02:29:34.780]  Thanks for the time.
[02:29:35.821 --> 02:29:36.261]  Thanks, mate.
[02:29:37.455 --> 02:29:40.918]  All right, folks, we are back live here with our guests leaving us.
[02:29:40.958 --> 02:29:43.980]  We were just live with them, but we're back live with just good old Alex Jones here.
[02:29:44.721 --> 02:29:47.944]  And I mean, I got to tell you, it's so obvious the globals are behind Ukraine.
[02:29:48.484 --> 02:29:51.326]  It's so obvious they're behind the Santa Israel stuff.
[02:29:51.647 --> 02:29:53.588]  And it doesn't mean I support Israel and everything they're doing.
[02:29:54.489 --> 02:29:57.591]  I am sitting back and saying, what is the larger plan?
[02:29:58.132 --> 02:29:58.792]  Why is this?
[02:29:59.753 --> 02:30:07.385]  When you could never talk about this stuff in the past, I mean, I agree, if you criticize Israel in any way, you'd get censored before, and that was wrong, the Israel lobby's wrong, and I talk about that.
[02:30:07.725 --> 02:30:13.174]  But now it's super cool to attack Israel, and people think, oh, we're winning, we're gonna get the head of the snake.
[02:30:13.214 --> 02:30:14.356]  That's not the head of the snake, folks.
[02:30:16.044 --> 02:30:19.705]  It's these big central banks that are taking over.
[02:30:20.105 --> 02:30:27.407]  It's the policies of cutting off the carbon, shutting down the farmers, shutting down the infrastructure, destroying the fertilizer.
[02:30:27.627 --> 02:30:28.928]  I mean, that's real.
[02:30:29.648 --> 02:30:32.208]  You can talk about who owns it, who runs it, who's in control of it.
[02:30:32.649 --> 02:30:33.909]  This is all going down.
[02:30:35.225 --> 02:30:37.887]  It's an extremely dangerous time to be alive.
[02:30:38.748 --> 02:30:40.169]  I've got some other news I want to hit.
[02:30:40.189 --> 02:30:47.835]  I mentioned this earlier, but we don't normally have computer crashes with our systems, but we've had a lot of crashes today for whatever reason.
[02:30:47.855 --> 02:30:50.177]  But guys, do we have the clip of Don Jr.?
[02:30:52.278 --> 02:30:52.719]  We have it.
[02:30:52.979 --> 02:30:54.080]  Okay, Don Jr.
[02:30:54.140 --> 02:30:58.303]  says Tucker Carlson is on the table to be dad's VP.
[02:30:58.943 --> 02:30:59.204]  Okay.
[02:31:00.197 --> 02:31:01.919]  I love Don Jr.
[02:31:01.939 --> 02:31:04.141]  and I love his joke about making me the press secretary.
[02:31:04.181 --> 02:31:07.984]  I think he's a great guy and he's teasing a 2028 run.
[02:31:08.004 --> 02:31:09.065]  I love Don Jr.
[02:31:09.085 --> 02:31:10.626]  I think he's a great guy.
[02:31:11.267 --> 02:31:13.669]  But I've talked to Tucker and everybody else has talked to Tucker.
[02:31:14.069 --> 02:31:17.672]  He is not running for Trump's VP.
[02:31:17.712 --> 02:31:18.813]  He doesn't want power.
[02:31:19.274 --> 02:31:21.576]  He wants to fish and hunt all day and do his shows.
[02:31:22.096 --> 02:31:23.477]  And he's not going to be Trump's VP.
[02:31:24.508 --> 02:31:26.928]  So it's hype to sit there and say he's on the table.
[02:31:27.249 --> 02:31:49.253]  Well maybe he's on the table because Melania and Trump have asked him, and by the way they have, and Tucker has said on air, and I've talked to him off air, and said God would have to, because I read this in the news, I've talked to Tucker, he said God would have to appear before me and tell me to run as VP.
[02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:52.781]  It's not happening.
[02:31:53.482 --> 02:31:56.184]  We need to talk about who Trump's real VP will be.
[02:31:56.705 --> 02:31:57.766]  Somebody he can trust.
[02:31:58.347 --> 02:32:01.830]  And so, this is just hype from Don Jr.
[02:32:01.870 --> 02:32:02.191]  Here it is.
[02:32:03.404 --> 02:32:05.625]  Could you see your father running with Ron DeSantis?
[02:32:05.725 --> 02:32:08.747]  I asked him that question over the summer, and he didn't rule it out.
[02:32:09.028 --> 02:32:10.909]  Could you see Ron DeSantis?
[02:32:11.349 --> 02:32:12.029]  It's hard.
[02:32:12.069 --> 02:32:14.071]  People do that.
[02:32:14.331 --> 02:32:19.494]  I would do whatever I could to make sure it wasn't Nikki Haley, but Ron DeSantis?
[02:32:19.514 --> 02:32:23.777]  You're never going to rule out someone that is a leading contender.
[02:32:23.817 --> 02:32:25.038]  It doesn't mean that's who you go with.
[02:32:25.058 --> 02:32:26.599]  If I could see other people, that would be great.
[02:32:26.639 --> 02:32:27.679]  I'd love to see J.D.
[02:32:27.699 --> 02:32:28.460]  Vance.
[02:32:28.540 --> 02:32:30.121]  I'd love to see Tucker Carlson.
[02:32:30.161 --> 02:32:36.804]   I'd love to see people who are just Principally, in alignment, as well as aggressive.
[02:32:36.844 --> 02:32:38.205]  You actually need a fighter.
[02:32:38.565 --> 02:32:40.446]  The Republicans in Washington, D.C.
[02:32:40.506 --> 02:32:40.987]  are weak.
[02:32:41.267 --> 02:32:43.768]  You can have the House, the Senate, and they'll still roll over.
[02:32:43.808 --> 02:32:44.188]  It doesn't matter.
[02:32:44.208 --> 02:32:46.209]  Don, is your dad serious about Tucker Carlson?
[02:32:46.249 --> 02:32:47.470]  Are those rumors serious?
[02:32:48.223 --> 02:32:48.804]  I would imagine.
[02:32:48.824 --> 02:32:50.865]  Listen, that clearly would be on the table, right?
[02:32:50.925 --> 02:32:52.246]  I mean, they're very friendly.
[02:32:52.286 --> 02:32:54.548]  I think they agree on virtually all of these things.
[02:32:54.588 --> 02:32:57.611]  They certainly agree on stopping the never-ending wars.
[02:32:58.532 --> 02:33:00.974]  And so, you know, I would love to see that happen.
[02:33:01.054 --> 02:33:02.755]  And, you know, that would certainly be a contender.
[02:33:03.596 --> 02:33:05.077]  Ben Carson, those rumors legit?
[02:33:06.298 --> 02:33:06.939]  Ben's great.
[02:33:06.979 --> 02:33:11.683]  I mean, what a great, what a great American, someone who was just steadfast.
[02:33:11.783 --> 02:33:12.644]  All right, that's enough.
[02:33:12.664 --> 02:33:14.105]  So the news headline is deceptive, I mean.
[02:33:18.382 --> 02:33:19.163]  Oh, he's on the table.
[02:33:19.723 --> 02:33:19.923]  Yeah.
[02:33:20.283 --> 02:33:21.784]  It's fair to say they love Tucker.
[02:33:22.205 --> 02:33:23.205]  Not happening.
[02:33:23.826 --> 02:33:24.827]  Put the money in the bank.
[02:33:25.327 --> 02:33:26.027]  Guarantee it.
[02:33:26.468 --> 02:33:27.088]  Not happening.
[02:33:27.108 --> 02:33:28.449]  And you heard it here first.
[02:33:29.190 --> 02:33:29.470]  All right.
[02:33:30.330 --> 02:33:37.195]  We got Drew Hernandez, who always knocks us out of the park, on the whole New World Order system, about to come up and host the fourth hour.
[02:33:37.836 --> 02:33:40.337]  And then the mighty Owen Schroer, 3 p.m.
[02:33:40.858 --> 02:33:42.399]  Central Standard Time.
[02:33:43.902 --> 02:33:47.744]  We'll be hosting the War Room, the former political prisoner, Owen Schroeder.
[02:33:48.424 --> 02:33:55.107]  Before I end this transmission, we really need Sean Strickland as Trump's VP.
[02:33:55.567 --> 02:33:58.628]  I'm trolling a little bit, but I covered that last hour.
[02:33:58.988 --> 02:34:00.089]  We're going to put that out.
[02:34:01.460 --> 02:34:02.941]  On X very, very soon.
[02:34:03.941 --> 02:34:08.823]  The left is going to go crazy and it'll make Sean Strickland's comments get 10 more million views.
[02:34:08.843 --> 02:34:10.223]  So we're going to have some fun.
[02:34:10.243 --> 02:34:20.347]  But we need somebody with that no compromise attitude and not always giving the left the authority, bowing down to them like they're the social bosses.
[02:34:20.787 --> 02:34:21.827]  They're the high priest.
[02:34:22.167 --> 02:34:23.228]  They have all the answers.
[02:34:23.528 --> 02:34:24.168]  No, you don't.
[02:34:25.256 --> 02:34:33.420]  I want to ask listeners again, please take the clips from Band.Video and InfoWars.com forward slash show and share them everywhere.

[02:35:30.137 --> 02:35:31.438]  Winter is here.

[02:36:21.288 --> 02:36:23.629]  InfoWars.com, Band.Video.
[02:36:23.649 --> 02:36:25.751]  I am your guest host, Drew Hernandez.
[02:36:25.771 --> 02:36:32.535]  You are now watching the fourth hour of the most banned and censored transmission in the universe, the Alex Jones Show.
[02:36:32.995 --> 02:36:37.778]  Welcome to every single one of you guys, and to continue on with what's going on with Davos in 2024.
[02:36:38.098 --> 02:37:08.397]   Yes, it is absolutely very interesting that their theme for this year is regaining trust Now, if you really think about who these people are and how satanic and deceptive they really are, they're not genuinely trying to wipe up their ways and clean up their satanic and globalist New World Order authoritarian ways, attempting to weaponize the future of technology and weaponize information and weaponize the governments of the world in order to
[02:37:09.480 --> 02:37:11.301]  Control the minds of millions of people.
[02:37:11.321 --> 02:37:14.963]  They're not backtracking on the climate change death cult operation.
[02:37:15.003 --> 02:37:19.866]  They're not backtracking on the death jab and the future technologies of that, by the way.
[02:37:20.407 --> 02:37:28.952]  It looks like Bill Gates made this very clear with his little stop in Davos in an interview, I believe with Bloomberg, that there's a new technology on the way.
[02:37:29.092 --> 02:37:32.714]  They're rolling out new patches where they won't even really need the jabs anymore.
[02:37:32.974 --> 02:37:39.058]  You're still gonna get the death vaccine, but you're gonna get it distributed differently via a patch with microneedles.
[02:37:39.398 --> 02:37:43.400]  And Bill Gates has made that very clear that that's where they are going next.
[02:37:43.440 --> 02:37:50.083]  And they're spending tens of millions of dollars to bring this technology to the entire world.
[02:37:50.623 --> 02:37:53.384]  And so we know that's the future with disease X on the horizon.
[02:37:53.424 --> 02:37:57.566]  We know the future with their pathogens that they will launch on mankind.
[02:37:57.606 --> 02:38:15.453]   We've seen all of the massive Corporations and vaccine distributor companies and CEOs all on the same wavelength, even the CDC talking heads and all the proxies with the World Health Organization, all just happening to know that there's something coming in the future.
[02:38:15.853 --> 02:38:24.737]  There's going to be some kind of pathogen that's going to be worse than COVID-19 that mankind is going to have to deal with and the governments of the world are going to have to deal with.
[02:38:25.157 --> 02:38:51.817]   And that's why the UN is pushing very aggressively in the United States of America to seize, legally, legislatively, emergency powers, basically martial law, top-head globalist emergency powers from the CDC and the World Health Organization, where they get to declare A health emergency nationally and they get to establish their own governors essentially in different states in the United States of America and they get to decide how bad the pandemic is.
[02:38:52.098 --> 02:39:23.684]   They get to decide how bad and how really extensive and detrimental and how long this pandemic in the future will last because 2020 was a test run ladies and gentlemen and 2020 definitely was a test run And the rolling out of COVID and the mass lockdowns and the death jab vaccine mandates and the mask mandates and testing how the children respond to the mask mandates and testing how mankind responds to the lockdowns and just how far they could really take it.
[02:39:23.724 --> 02:39:25.525]  That's where the future is going to go.
[02:39:25.565 --> 02:39:27.606]  And yes, Bill Gates made it official.
[02:39:27.706 --> 02:39:32.069]  The next generation of vaccines, they will be micro needle patches.
[02:39:33.250 --> 02:39:35.612]  And people are starting to really pay attention.
[02:39:35.692 --> 02:39:36.853]  It's like, who's Bill Gates?
[02:39:37.153 --> 02:39:39.775]  This guy that came in with Microsoft.
[02:39:39.815 --> 02:39:49.782]  He's got a family history of Planned Parenthood and eugenics and everything, you know, that InfoWars has been so aggressively and boldly exposing for the past few decades.
[02:39:50.983 --> 02:39:58.008]  I really enjoy seeing becoming part of the conversation in the general public.
[02:39:58.469 --> 02:40:00.030]  And this is InfoWars' role.
[02:40:00.822 --> 02:40:02.783]  And this is what Infowars' role will always be.
[02:40:03.323 --> 02:40:08.745]  Is being ahead of the times, tomorrow's news today, putting out what's not popular, but what's essential.
[02:40:09.385 --> 02:40:15.187]  Putting out the truth, but way, will literally come with persecution, because you're ahead of the time.
[02:40:15.727 --> 02:40:17.388]  That's truly what an Infowarrior is.
[02:40:17.448 --> 02:40:19.228]  It's an individual that's ahead of their time.
[02:40:19.708 --> 02:40:30.292]  It's an individual that's willing to speak the truth, way ahead of what the establishment, whether left or right, has pre-approved, not only in the media, but in the culture, for people to talk about.
[02:40:31.486 --> 02:40:35.310]  And if you could understand that, then you understand what this information war truly is.
[02:40:35.350 --> 02:40:36.051]  You want to know why?
[02:40:36.451 --> 02:40:38.293]  Because the other side understands that.
[02:40:38.814 --> 02:40:54.282]   Because the other side, when you have these CIA operations, and you have these NSA ops, and all these intelligence agents carrying out their psychological operations on both sides, Republican, Democrat, the general public, worldwide, They understand that.
[02:40:54.723 --> 02:40:57.404]  And they understand that they have to get ahead of the population.
[02:40:57.424 --> 02:40:58.785]  They have to get ahead of the times.
[02:40:59.305 --> 02:41:03.567]  They have to get their narrative out front, 10, 15, 20 years ahead.
[02:41:04.027 --> 02:41:06.728]  Because that's how they control generations of individuals.
[02:41:07.048 --> 02:41:08.229]  We'll be right back, don't go anywhere.
[02:41:08.689 --> 02:41:17.653]  Now why are they seeking to regain the trust in the New World Order super conference that they have at the beginning of every single year, which is interesting?
[02:41:18.514 --> 02:41:21.035]  Because Rebel News is killing it, and you saw that.
[02:41:21.710 --> 02:41:28.412]  You saw that in one of these New World Order hacks that Avi was really pinning down and questioning.
[02:41:29.132 --> 02:41:30.032]  And he said it himself.
[02:41:30.292 --> 02:41:30.992]  He said it himself.
[02:41:31.032 --> 02:41:34.733]  He said, oh, we come together at the beginning of every single year.
[02:41:34.793 --> 02:41:42.295]  We come together at the beginning of every single year to talk about the hardships that we have to face at the head of every single year.
[02:41:42.315 --> 02:41:44.575]  These people want to be ahead of their time.
[02:41:45.116 --> 02:41:46.856]  These people want to be ahead of your generation.
[02:41:47.356 --> 02:41:52.635]   These people want to be ahead of everyone's Reality.
[02:41:53.155 --> 02:42:00.200]  Now what I mean by that is, this is why you'll hear Klaus Schwab say, we need to be masters of the technology of today and the future in order to be what?
[02:42:00.260 --> 02:42:01.481]  Masters of the future.
[02:42:02.102 --> 02:42:07.786]  Because these people are on the same wavelength of this Antichrist spirit and agenda and system.
[02:42:08.447 --> 02:42:12.810]  And so with that God complex within their mind, they adopt that.
[02:42:12.950 --> 02:42:20.636]  They adopt the Antichrist mindset, which is not just an individual that's in opposition to Jesus Christ, the Bible, and everything that God stands for.
[02:42:21.767 --> 02:42:31.083]  Antichrist is a pseudochrist in the position, a false actor, a counterfeit, an individual that has usurped the authority or attempting to look like they are.
[02:42:31.764 --> 02:42:35.450]  So these people will adopt the mindset where they have a god-like complex.
[02:42:36.320 --> 02:42:38.321]  They believe they're the saviors of the universe.
[02:42:38.761 --> 02:42:41.042]  They believe that they're the masters of the future.
[02:42:41.582 --> 02:42:44.364]  They believe that they're the masters and the architect of time.
[02:42:44.804 --> 02:42:47.285]  This is why they want to rewrite the narrative of the future.
[02:42:47.325 --> 02:42:49.886]  This is why they have Agenda 2020, Agenda 2021, Agenda 2025, Agenda 2030, and Agenda 2050.
[02:42:49.745 --> 02:42:58.786]   2021, agenda 2025, agenda 2030, and agenda 2050. Because these people, they believe that they are
[02:42:58.786 --> 02:43:04.465]   the overseers of time. Okay, when it comes to the globalist mindset, you have to understand from
[02:43:04.465 --> 02:43:11.985]   this biblical, serious, spiritual perspective, this anti-Christ mindset, it is a messianic complex.
[02:43:12.228 --> 02:43:15.189]  And they believe in their own minds that they're the saviors of humanity.
[02:43:15.509 --> 02:43:20.050]  And they view you as a weak, pathetic peasant that cannot do anything for themselves.
[02:43:20.070 --> 02:43:21.271]  That's why they look down on you.
[02:43:21.311 --> 02:43:22.351]  They won't answer questions.
[02:43:22.391 --> 02:43:27.993]  If you actually go to Switzerland, just like what Rebel News is doing, and question these people, you'll get an answer here and there.
[02:43:28.453 --> 02:43:31.193]  But they will not speak to you, not because they're afraid.
[02:43:31.273 --> 02:43:36.135]  They will not speak to you, not because they're afraid you're going to take their words out of context.
[02:43:36.175 --> 02:43:38.716]  No, they won't speak to you because you are a piece of trash.
[02:43:40.760 --> 02:43:45.262]  You are a pathetic peasant that lives directly under their boot.
[02:43:45.782 --> 02:43:48.323]  Okay, they view you as a nuisance.
[02:43:48.943 --> 02:43:51.344]  They view you as something that needs to be exterminated.
[02:43:51.364 --> 02:43:52.465]  These are the same people.
[02:43:53.214 --> 02:44:14.828]  That are on the same wavelength with Bill Gates that are totally okay with depopulating the Earth, whether it's via pushing homosexuality, STDs, and AIDS, or whether it's via pushing the death jabs and depopulating humanity through the mRNA, or whether it's pushing abortion, which is literally dismembering, slaughtering, human sacrifice, and fencicide of babies.
[02:44:15.408 --> 02:44:24.695]  It doesn't matter, whichever depopulation agenda you want to go with, these people are totally for it, they support it, and they champion it, and they celebrate it.
[02:44:25.396 --> 02:44:32.981]  And that is how they normalize it within cultures, not only in the United States of America, but worldwide, no matter what country you go to, they all sound the same.
[02:44:33.342 --> 02:44:36.204]  They may speak a different language, but they all sound the same.
[02:44:36.604 --> 02:44:39.066]  They may be speaking a totally different tongue!
[02:44:39.546 --> 02:44:41.687]  But the agenda and the spirit is the same.
[02:44:41.867 --> 02:44:46.269]  Because you really have to tie this all the way back to the origin of what it really is.
[02:44:46.309 --> 02:44:47.889]  And the origin is the father of lies.
[02:44:48.089 --> 02:44:50.250]  This goes back to the Garden of Eden.
[02:44:50.270 --> 02:44:53.091]  This goes to the serpent, the ultimate globalist.
[02:44:53.151 --> 02:44:55.052]  That's where the globalism originates.
[02:44:55.092 --> 02:44:56.753]  It's the heart of Lucifer itself.
[02:44:57.133 --> 02:44:58.493]  It's carried out throughout the scripture.
[02:44:58.513 --> 02:44:59.774]  You see this with the Tower of Babel.
[02:45:00.385 --> 02:45:15.741]  You see this throughout the entire scriptures, all the way to the end time scenario, before the second coming of Jesus Christ and the rise of the Antichrist and the New World Order, the One World Militarized System, the One World Economic System, the One World Satanic Religion, the One World Establishment.
[02:45:16.405 --> 02:45:20.707]  And the frontman will be the Antichrist, all empowered by Satan and Lucifer himself.
[02:45:20.927 --> 02:45:27.650]  Drew, why are you really bringing it to that level when you're talking about Davos and the World Economic Forum?
[02:45:28.190 --> 02:45:29.791]  Because all of these people are pushing.
[02:45:29.831 --> 02:45:34.993]  You see, the problem is, is the devil masquerades as an angel of light.
[02:45:35.931 --> 02:45:46.179]  And so Satan will propose and present himself or these demonic legions, especially in a political environment, especially in a government or a cultural environment.
[02:45:47.059 --> 02:45:53.965]  The art of deception is presenting you something that is safe, wholesome, acceptable, that's there to protect you.
[02:45:54.825 --> 02:46:05.093]  The ultimate deception is convincing the target that you're there to protect them from a threat outside that is trying to destroy them, hurt them, or their family.
[02:46:06.008 --> 02:46:19.856]  And this is essentially the direction that the WEF, Davos, Klaus Schwab, guys like Bill Gates, BlackRock, CDC, World Health Organization, Fauci, you name it, right?
[02:46:19.996 --> 02:46:22.837]  All of the usual suspects.
[02:46:23.357 --> 02:46:24.278]  ADL, you name it.
[02:46:25.258 --> 02:46:26.299]  Fill in the blank, okay?
[02:46:26.339 --> 02:46:26.879]  Fill in the blank.
[02:46:26.919 --> 02:46:27.400]  Doesn't matter.
[02:46:27.440 --> 02:46:28.000]  Fill in the blank.
[02:46:28.743 --> 02:46:31.405]  They all go with that same tactic.
[02:46:31.826 --> 02:46:34.848]  We are here to protect you from misinformation.
[02:46:35.229 --> 02:46:37.711]  We're here to protect you from disinformation.
[02:46:37.891 --> 02:46:40.974]  We're here to protect you from those scary MAGA Republicans.
[02:46:41.234 --> 02:46:48.640]  We're here to protect you from a second administration of Donald Trump, which is going to be accompanied with a dictatorial authoritarian regime.
[02:46:48.900 --> 02:46:50.682]  We're here to protect you and prevent.
[02:46:50.882 --> 02:46:52.183]  We're the prevention squad.
[02:46:52.223 --> 02:46:58.847]   We are the globalist kumbaya utopian Prevention squad of authoritarianism.
[02:46:58.907 --> 02:47:07.533]  So they paint a picture very beautifully, by the way, if you really, if you really take a look at it, they paint this picture and very convincing of some kind of threat.
[02:47:07.553 --> 02:47:21.976]   And this is where, you know, people get into, you know, Project Blue Beam in the future, where they believe that they will stage alien invasions with their advanced aerospace technology that goes beyond What we know to be the laws of physics and gravity.
[02:47:22.036 --> 02:47:29.765]  This is when you really start getting into how powerful and capable the Deep State and New World Order governments of the world truly are.
[02:47:30.526 --> 02:47:32.188]  Well, they will prop up a threat.
[02:47:32.948 --> 02:47:38.455]  And as they prop up the threat, they convince the target that a solution is needed to protect themselves.
[02:47:39.204 --> 02:47:45.591]  And the solution isn't necessarily to, well, you have the Second Amendment, go strap up and buy tons of ammunition and let's hold down the fort.
[02:47:45.631 --> 02:47:47.332]  It's the Alamo, the United States of America.
[02:47:47.352 --> 02:47:48.313]  No, no, no, no.
[02:47:48.353 --> 02:47:50.155]  What they do is they strip you of your rights.
[02:47:50.836 --> 02:47:53.178]  What they do is they strip you of all of your autonomy.
[02:47:53.779 --> 02:47:55.841]  And what they do is they strip you of even education.
[02:47:56.474 --> 02:48:09.761]  And what they do is they strip you of every source, outside source, that is not pre-approved and that is not coming down the lane, or is that not coming down from the stream, that has all been vetted, pre-approved, and allowed.
[02:48:09.781 --> 02:48:11.122]  This is the flow of information.
[02:48:11.162 --> 02:48:14.024]  What I'm explaining to you guys is literally how this information war works.
[02:48:14.444 --> 02:48:21.708]  This is done through the media, through education, through every influential institution you could possibly think of, not in America, but worldwide.
[02:48:22.628 --> 02:48:23.689]  Across the entire board.
[02:48:23.889 --> 02:48:26.970]  Health, science, the music industry, Hollywood, you name it.
[02:48:26.990 --> 02:48:27.950]  Predictive programming.
[02:48:28.551 --> 02:48:34.153]  Okay, even back in the day it was just like newspaper when people were really reading newspapers and that was their source of news.
[02:48:34.533 --> 02:48:48.139]  As the technology advances, these deep state actors and antichrist proxies, they will harness and weaponize to propagate to mankind their pre-approved satanic message of global unification and utopia.
[02:48:48.399 --> 02:48:50.721]  See, the problem is that they prop themselves up.
[02:48:51.082 --> 02:49:01.513]  They are the abuser, and they are also the protector, and they prop themselves up in the media and in the culture as such through a humanitarian effort.
[02:49:01.593 --> 02:49:06.198]  And see, this is what the World Economic Forum and these globalist powers are really good at.
[02:49:06.338 --> 02:49:07.299]  They're really good at.
[02:49:07.719 --> 02:49:29.256]  Because anyone could take a look at a Lil Nas X and he's blaspheming Christ, he's simulating getting sodomized by Satan, and he's writing down a homosexual strippled pole down to hell, and he's, you know, having a one-on-one game with Lucifer and Heaven in his new music video, and he's blaspheming the table of communion and his promotions for his music video.
[02:49:30.077 --> 02:49:31.918]  All kinds of satanic imagery.
[02:49:31.998 --> 02:49:33.019]  See, that's obvious.
[02:49:33.840 --> 02:49:36.262]  That's obvious, and that's obvious to pick up on.
[02:49:37.228 --> 02:49:44.193]  And people can see that and line that up with what the Bible has to say and that's, that's, that's, that's, uh, that's not that advanced.
[02:49:44.853 --> 02:49:53.519]  That's just a, that kid Lil Nas X is just some homosexual Hollywood music industry plant prostitute, literally getting pimped out by Satan.
[02:49:53.539 --> 02:49:54.740]  It's just, it's, it's interesting.
[02:49:54.780 --> 02:50:04.427]  But, uh, the way the World Economic Forum goes about this and the way that these globalist entities go about this, and they've been doing it really good for the past few decades.
[02:50:05.373 --> 02:50:12.356]  Is that they prop themselves up as this humanitarian machine that wants to bring humanity together.
[02:50:13.196 --> 02:50:17.338]  And it's a message of unity that sounds convincing and it sounds safe.
[02:50:17.958 --> 02:50:22.920]  But they prop up their message of unity and they prop up the problems.
[02:50:22.980 --> 02:50:25.761]  This is why they have their yearly gatherings.
[02:50:26.525 --> 02:50:42.136]  They prop up the problems, they prop up the threats, they prop up the imminent threats to civilization and humanity, climate change, or whether it be MAGA Republicans, or disinformation, misinformation, or some kind of looming health threat that's going to come by the year 2035.
[02:50:42.176 --> 02:50:42.977]  This is why they do this.
[02:50:45.672 --> 02:50:52.955]  And while at the same time, they have all of their proxies throughout world governments that have already stripped freedoms from free mankind.
[02:50:53.375 --> 02:50:59.817]  So when they hit that button, and it's time to punch in whatever that operation is, you don't even have the freedoms to defend yourself.
[02:50:59.857 --> 02:51:00.578]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:01.018 --> 02:51:02.618]  So understand, Infowarriors.
[02:51:03.138 --> 02:51:16.173]   And by the way, since Alex Jones' Infowarriors has returned back to X, and the shows are livestreaming on a daily basis, And if you're watching on X, make sure to share the rebroadcast right now.
[02:51:16.193 --> 02:51:17.554]  We appreciate you.
[02:51:17.574 --> 02:51:21.036]  A lot of new people are flooding in.
[02:51:21.056 --> 02:51:22.017]  And it's good.
[02:51:22.478 --> 02:51:24.259]  And this is why they didn't want Alex on.
[02:51:24.279 --> 02:51:27.241]  Twitter 1.0 and the old regime and the old guard.
[02:51:28.202 --> 02:51:31.284]  Because there's a lot of people that are getting exposed to this information.
[02:51:31.665 --> 02:51:32.946]  And we're fully aware of that.
[02:51:33.566 --> 02:51:45.482]   We're fully aware of people that are maybe tuning in for the very first time and They're like, let me see what's going on with this guy Alex Jones or InfoWars or anybody else that might pop up on the show.
[02:51:46.522 --> 02:51:58.746]  And so breaking down this information for people that may be curious or people that have heard of the World Economic Forum and people that have heard of Klaus Schwab and are starting to view them in negative light.
[02:52:00.886 --> 02:52:06.948]  You got to come with the receipts and the facts and you got to come with just exactly why these people should not be trusted.
[02:52:07.432 --> 02:52:11.815]  Because we're not like the left where we just slander individuals and we sit there and we say, well, they're bad.
[02:52:11.855 --> 02:52:12.575]  Don't listen to them.
[02:52:12.615 --> 02:52:13.396]  No, that's commie.
[02:52:13.416 --> 02:52:14.216]  That's that's cult.
[02:52:15.157 --> 02:52:16.057]  And we're not a cult.
[02:52:16.898 --> 02:52:19.880]  We deal with truth the way the truth and the live Jesus Christ.
[02:52:20.780 --> 02:52:30.946]  And so when you're dealing with an entity like the World Economic Forum and all of these globalist organizations that have been getting exposed for decades, they're really not that hard to expose.
[02:52:31.266 --> 02:52:32.367]  I think that's the point.
[02:52:32.747 --> 02:52:34.008]  I think that's really the point.
[02:52:34.048 --> 02:52:37.109]   And when people They get red-pilled.
[02:52:37.169 --> 02:52:41.891]  They get seriously red-pilled when they discover, wow, a lot of these decisions being made around the globe.
[02:52:42.911 --> 02:52:48.894]  In terms of health, in terms of the media, in terms of the world of politics and government.
[02:52:49.314 --> 02:52:53.155]  Not only just the United States of America, but these people influence policy.
[02:52:53.175 --> 02:52:54.135]  You gotta understand that.
[02:52:54.155 --> 02:52:55.156]  And that's the big issue.
[02:52:55.696 --> 02:53:10.410]   The big issue is that you have these conferences with these billionaires and these multi-millionaires and these Lobbyists and these very wealthy individuals that do not believe in sovereignty of nations, that do not believe in sovereignty of states.
[02:53:11.130 --> 02:53:14.931]  And these people believe in a global identity.
[02:53:14.972 --> 02:53:17.552]  These people believe in a cashless society.
[02:53:17.592 --> 02:53:22.634]  These people believe in a centralized hub for all of humanity to be identified in.
[02:53:22.874 --> 02:53:26.995]  They believe in the hive mind because they believe that that's going to bring us unified.
[02:53:27.535 --> 02:53:35.930]   And the mind of a globalist may or may not Believe that what they're believing in is the right thing to believe in?
[02:53:36.290 --> 02:53:39.174]  A lot of these globalists have serious satanic intentions.
[02:53:40.095 --> 02:53:44.947]   Some of them may just believe that Well, what's so wrong with being unified?
[02:53:44.967 --> 02:53:46.649]  Well, I'll tell you what's the problem with that.
[02:53:47.149 --> 02:53:50.413]  Because their definition of unification is ultimate tyranny.
[02:53:50.513 --> 02:53:52.455]  Bow down to the surveillance state.
[02:53:52.755 --> 02:53:55.157]  Sacrifice, especially if you're an American.
[02:53:55.177 --> 02:53:56.839]  Throw away your constitutional rights.
[02:53:57.260 --> 02:53:59.141]  Throw away your God-given inalienable rights.
[02:53:59.181 --> 02:54:02.565]  Because that's what separates you from their global unification.
[02:54:03.849 --> 02:54:05.530]  They don't want governors of states.
[02:54:06.171 --> 02:54:15.238]  They don't want, especially particularly the United States of America, they don't want the states of the Union to have any form of autonomy, even outside of the federal government.
[02:54:15.398 --> 02:54:16.859]  They don't even want a federal government.
[02:54:17.820 --> 02:54:30.285]   They want an overarching, okay, technocracy mixed with technology, a globalist, scientific slash Health.
[02:54:30.365 --> 02:54:33.608]  And when I say health, they just guise themselves like a Fauci.
[02:54:33.628 --> 02:54:34.629]  They throw a disguise.
[02:54:35.390 --> 02:54:49.765]  Okay, it's this it's this satanic, scientific slash medical health industry, technocracy, globalist, overarching world government surveillance state that they want to impose on humanity.
[02:54:49.845 --> 02:54:51.387]  And that's what they've been going with.
[02:54:51.934 --> 02:54:53.095]  The past couple decades.
[02:54:53.395 --> 02:54:55.337]  And they fully, in my opinion, launched that in 2020.
[02:54:55.517 --> 02:54:57.418]  I mean, really look around you.
[02:54:57.438 --> 02:54:59.920]  They locked down the entire world in 2020.
[02:55:01.081 --> 02:55:04.103]  Dude, they literally told you that you needed to mask.
[02:55:04.263 --> 02:55:06.825]  At first, Fauci told you you don't need to mask up.
[02:55:07.386 --> 02:55:08.066]  That's absurd.
[02:55:08.146 --> 02:55:09.847]  Well, actually, you do need to mask up.
[02:55:10.068 --> 02:55:11.449]  Well, actually, you need to wear two.
[02:55:11.829 --> 02:55:13.150]  Actually, you need to wear three.
[02:55:13.370 --> 02:55:15.812]  And by the way, when the vaccines come, you need that too.
[02:55:16.776 --> 02:55:18.756]  Oh, and by the way, the vaccine isn't enough.
[02:55:19.017 --> 02:55:21.417]  You're gonna need like six boosters after that.
[02:55:21.617 --> 02:55:29.779]  And here we are, fast forward to 2024 and Bill Gates straight up telling people that those vaccines are not sufficient.
[02:55:30.139 --> 02:55:33.780]  We need a new technology that'll make the vaccines last longer.
[02:55:33.840 --> 02:55:39.401]  So we're doing away with the actual syringes and we're gonna go with the patches with the microneedles.
[02:55:40.481 --> 02:55:42.364]  See, this is what people are waking up to, man.
[02:55:42.444 --> 02:55:58.585]  And people have to wake up that all of this, these are not well-intended people that are trying to give you medical advice, or these are not well-intended people behind meta that are the fact-checkers that are trying to protect you from lies and misinformation and disinformation.
[02:55:59.145 --> 02:56:13.389]  These are not well-intentioned people within the intelligence agencies, the FBI, which has now come out, that apparently that the Feds are surveilling and monitoring anyone that makes a financial transaction with the word Trump or MAGA in it.
[02:56:13.649 --> 02:56:15.510]  These are not well-intentioned people.
[02:56:16.070 --> 02:56:18.871]  These are not people that are believing the wrong thing.
[02:56:18.891 --> 02:56:27.053]  These are not people that are sitting there saying to themselves, well, we believe that this is actually a threat, so we're doing everything possible.
[02:56:27.828 --> 02:56:39.375]  It's not like we're living in World War II and these people view Adolf Hitler as a threat and the Allies want to get together and take down that threat because it's a global threat.
[02:56:39.795 --> 02:56:47.959]  These people are viewing you, you, you, they're viewing you as an identified threat because you are.
[02:56:47.979 --> 02:56:52.302]  They view you as an identified threat because you are a threat.
[02:56:53.610 --> 02:56:57.412]  And see, this is where the psychological operation really warps people's minds.
[02:56:57.472 --> 02:56:58.832]  Because when you and I hear that, what?
[02:56:59.153 --> 02:57:01.054]  Agri-Republicans, domestic terrorists?
[02:57:01.414 --> 02:57:03.375]  Agri-Republicans a threat to democracy?
[02:57:03.695 --> 02:57:05.335]  We're calling for voter ID?
[02:57:05.696 --> 02:57:12.959]  And all these globalists and deep state entities, they all come down on us and call us racists and bigots and white supremacists, even if you're brown like me.
[02:57:13.319 --> 02:57:14.100]  Or if you're black!
[02:57:14.360 --> 02:57:14.880]  Doesn't matter!
[02:57:15.737 --> 02:57:17.819]  You see, that's the psychological operation.
[02:57:18.360 --> 02:57:20.642]  You do pose a threat to the New World Order.
[02:57:21.183 --> 02:57:23.765]  You do pose a threat to the surveillance state.
[02:57:24.326 --> 02:57:26.668]  You do pose a threat to the World Economic Forum.
[02:57:27.109 --> 02:57:28.070]  Because you're educated.
[02:57:28.350 --> 02:57:29.091]  You're articulate.
[02:57:29.691 --> 02:57:31.053]  You know exactly what's going on.
[02:57:31.113 --> 02:57:32.394]  You know the laws of the land.
[02:57:32.414 --> 02:57:34.897]  You understand your civil rights as an American.
[02:57:35.749 --> 02:57:37.470]  Okay, you understand what's going on.
[02:57:37.490 --> 02:57:42.232]  You see these people's plans for what they truly are and they are originated in tyranny.
[02:57:42.632 --> 02:57:45.873]  So yes, of course you're going to be called a domestic terrorist.
[02:57:46.133 --> 02:57:49.355]  Of course you're going to be called a threat to their democracy.
[02:57:49.375 --> 02:57:52.936]  And what that means is you're a threat to our regime because you will speak out.
[02:57:54.077 --> 02:57:59.779]  That's why Infowars and anyone that's speaking the truth is always going to be a threat.
[02:58:00.799 --> 02:58:14.692]   Because if we have a platform and if we have mouths and we have Life in our bodies, and if we have air in our lungs, and we have the truth in our hearts, that is the greatest threat to this New World Order regime.
[02:58:15.382 --> 02:58:16.743]  Because the truth shall set you free.
[02:58:16.763 --> 02:58:35.571]  And the problem that they have, and the biggest thing that these entities fear, are millions of people receiving the truth, accepting the truth, waking up as a result, and clearly being breached and pulled out of the matrix to identify who truly are the enemies to humanity.
[02:58:36.371 --> 02:58:38.512]  And they truly are the minority in this scenario.
[02:58:40.149 --> 02:58:43.830]  They truly are the minority in this scenario, and the majority of Americans.
[02:58:43.850 --> 02:58:45.531]  This is why they want to depopulate the Earth.
[02:58:45.571 --> 02:58:46.711]  Does it start to make sense now?
[02:58:47.512 --> 02:59:00.436]  Because they don't want this populace truly waking up to the reality that there are these minority, these very specific families, organizations, it's like a handful of them on two hands, that control the entire world.
[02:59:00.997 --> 02:59:04.258]  They control the world wars, they control everything and all the destinations.
[02:59:04.638 --> 02:59:07.459]  This is why they want to be masters of the future, masters of humanity.
[02:59:08.675 --> 02:59:14.351]  When billions of people start waking up to that, that's the information war, my friend.
[02:59:14.371 --> 02:59:15.214]  That's what they fear.
[02:59:17.068 --> 02:59:27.898]  That puts a fear in their hearts when billions of people, especially when they wake up to the reality of the gospel and Jesus Christ and they become born again, now they have a problem and they have a huge problem on their hands.
[02:59:28.458 --> 02:59:33.283]  Not for the purposes of violence, but for the purposes of people just not listening to their garbage anymore.
[02:59:33.323 --> 02:59:35.945]  That's why their theme this year in Davos 2024 is what?
[02:59:35.965 --> 02:59:36.626]  Regaining your trust!
[02:59:39.013 --> 02:59:39.993]  Don't fall for this crap.
[02:59:40.013 --> 02:59:41.734]  They're just a bunch of lying Satanists.
[02:59:41.914 --> 02:59:43.414]  Hey, I got some good news for everybody.

[03:01:16.504 --> 03:01:22.845]  Keep this machine going, especially as we go beyond 2024, where I'm just going to be honest with you guys.
[03:01:23.105 --> 03:01:48.819]   I think the real power struggle, if Trump gets in by some miracle this year, if Trump gets in and gets another four years, I think we saw a little bit of a preview I think we saw a little bit of a preview of what this power vacuum is going to look like with Trump no longer in the world of politics, in a position of running for elected office.
[03:01:49.499 --> 03:01:59.883]  I think we all saw a little bit of that power struggle with DeSantis turning his back on Trump and getting obliterated and Vivek trying to tell MAGA that we need him to save Trump.
[03:02:00.848 --> 03:02:01.868]  Whoever the hell that was.
[03:02:01.888 --> 03:02:10.951]  Especially Nikki Haley now being revealed for the deep state establishment shill being backed by Democrat billionaires.
[03:02:11.712 --> 03:02:15.493]  We saw a little bit of that power vacuum.
[03:02:15.713 --> 03:02:18.634]  And obviously, I think we all knew that was going to get wrapped up quickly.
[03:02:18.714 --> 03:02:24.356]  These Republican primaries are such an absolute waste of time.
[03:02:25.829 --> 03:02:27.090]  I mean, look at Nikki Haley.
[03:02:27.130 --> 03:02:29.411]  She's getting protected by CNN, MSNBC.
[03:02:29.471 --> 03:02:38.579]  You literally have Joy Reid up there defending Nikki Haley, saying that she lost the Iowa caucus because of white evangelical Christians.
[03:02:39.389 --> 03:02:40.509]  Yeah, give me a break.
[03:02:41.049 --> 03:02:42.750]  Isn't it crazy how Joy Reid says that?
[03:02:42.770 --> 03:02:44.390]  This woke black supremacist.
[03:02:44.630 --> 03:02:48.091]  She literally has a blonde wig on, just crapping on white people.
[03:02:48.312 --> 03:02:49.632]  What the hell's the matter with you?
[03:02:50.332 --> 03:02:52.873]  It's like total mental retardation.
[03:02:53.373 --> 03:02:53.973]  Absolutely.
[03:02:54.013 --> 03:02:58.274]  But that's why people like Joy Reid are propped up on MSNBC to attack white people.
[03:02:58.494 --> 03:02:59.375]  Attack white people!
[03:02:59.635 --> 03:03:01.895]  Attack white people with a blonde wig on!
[03:03:02.175 --> 03:03:04.056]  Attack white people with a blonde wig on!
[03:03:05.396 --> 03:03:05.876]  Unreal.
[03:03:06.036 --> 03:03:06.457]  Anyways.
[03:03:06.937 --> 03:03:07.357]  Anyways.
[03:03:08.866 --> 03:03:11.309]  Like I said, I think the real power vacuum is going to come in 2028.
[03:03:12.010 --> 03:03:12.891]  Things are going to get wild.
[03:03:12.951 --> 03:03:16.116]  So all that to say, support InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:03:16.136 --> 03:03:21.563]  Make sure that you guys are getting into the fight at some capacity by supporting the tip of the spear.
[03:03:23.105 --> 03:03:23.946]  Continuing on...
[03:03:24.935 --> 03:03:25.595]  With Davos.
[03:03:25.816 --> 03:03:30.678]  Let me show you guys some examples of what's been going on these past few days.
[03:03:31.379 --> 03:03:36.362]  And the European Commission president claims disinformation the world's gravest threat of 2024.
[03:03:38.183 --> 03:03:40.044]  She made herself very clear in her speech.
[03:03:40.984 --> 03:03:48.590]  For the global business community, the top concern for the next two years is not conflict or climate, she said in her Davos speech.
[03:03:49.090 --> 03:03:54.914]  It is disinformation and misinformation followed closely by polarization within our societies.
[03:03:55.414 --> 03:04:03.300]  She said many of the solutions lie not only in countries working together, but crucially on businesses and governments, businesses and democracies working together.
[03:04:03.320 --> 03:04:09.102]   And she said while many governments Hold many of the levers to deal with the great challenges of our time.
[03:04:09.162 --> 03:04:18.549]  Businesses have the innovation, the technology, the talents to deliver the solutions we need to fight threats like climate change or industrial scale disinformation.
[03:04:18.589 --> 03:04:23.492]  And she said there will always be those who try to exploit our openness, both from inside and out.
[03:04:23.752 --> 03:04:29.577]  There will always be attempts to put us off track, for example, with disinformation and misinformation.
[03:04:29.857 --> 03:04:39.860]   She also said in this statement that These globalists will play a role in instructing governments of the world just exactly how they need to combat misinformation and disinformation.
[03:04:40.640 --> 03:04:55.009]   And see, this is where people start to take an issue with these entities like the World Economic Forum, because they literally get to dictate Okay, they get to define just exactly what disinformation and misinformation means.
[03:04:55.269 --> 03:05:10.896]  So this is why I'm sounding the alarm, especially here on InfoWars.com and maybe those that are maybe finding Alex on X and they've never really listened to Alex before and they've been listening to Alex ever since he's come back on X and they're like, whoa man, like there might be something to this.
[03:05:11.476 --> 03:05:12.657]  Do not fall.
[03:05:13.357 --> 03:05:17.742]  Or their fake fraudulent attempts at regaining your trust.
[03:05:18.343 --> 03:05:18.723]  Okay?
[03:05:19.104 --> 03:05:25.591]  They're not attempting to regain your trust by curing their ways and righting their wrongs of the past.
[03:05:25.912 --> 03:05:27.894]  Because they're not openly saying anything like that!
[03:05:28.254 --> 03:05:32.295]  What they're attempting to do is fine tune their message of propaganda.
[03:05:32.595 --> 03:05:35.636]  What they're attempting to do is take it to the next level.
[03:05:35.916 --> 03:05:49.459]  What they're attempting to do is clearly take their psychological manipulations through all of their proxies and their speakers on their panels throughout Davos 2024 to make it sound more appealing, more humanitarian, and more welcoming.
[03:05:50.039 --> 03:05:51.400]  This is the art of deception.
[03:05:51.940 --> 03:05:55.021]  This is the devil masquerading as an angel of light.
[03:05:55.881 --> 03:06:10.012]   Further Diving deeper into levels of deception that are higher in advancement and that are more convincible by appearing to be something safe and appearing to be something that you could trust your own child with.
[03:06:10.673 --> 03:06:14.114]  Appearing to be something that has your best intentions in mind.
[03:06:15.634 --> 03:06:23.577]  Like those famous words that were said, you need to run away and I'm paraphrasing, when you hear the words, I am the government and I am here to help you.
[03:06:25.040 --> 03:06:28.702]  People need to really understand what that means, and it's not just government anymore.
[03:06:28.722 --> 03:06:31.384]  I am the World Economic Forum, and I am here to help you.
[03:06:31.404 --> 03:06:35.566]  I am- I am Mikhail Shuaib, and I am here to help you.
[03:06:35.586 --> 03:06:36.267]  Okay?
[03:06:36.287 --> 03:06:39.329]  Like, I- I am Bill Gates, and I am here to help you.
[03:06:39.429 --> 03:06:43.290]   It's like- Dude, David, fill in the blank, dude.
[03:06:43.810 --> 03:06:44.171]  Alright?
[03:06:44.391 --> 03:06:46.374]  I'm the CDC and I'm here to help you.
[03:06:46.394 --> 03:06:49.699]  I am the World Health Organization and I am here to help you.
[03:06:49.739 --> 03:06:51.081]  No, they are not here to help you.
[03:06:51.542 --> 03:06:54.887]  They are here to exploit you, manipulate you, and monetize you.
[03:06:55.307 --> 03:06:56.509]  And depopulate you.
[03:06:56.609 --> 03:06:57.551]  That's what they're here for.
[03:06:58.567 --> 03:07:03.892]  Okay, those levels of monetization will come with... They're already doing it with mass sterilization.
[03:07:04.253 --> 03:07:04.813]  They're already doing it.
[03:07:05.334 --> 03:07:07.156]  They're already doing it with mass sterilization.
[03:07:07.416 --> 03:07:12.981]  They've convinced Gen Z, a majority of Gen Z, not all of Gen Z, that hacking their genitals is fine.
[03:07:13.042 --> 03:07:17.486]  If you're a little boy and you feel like you're a girl, well just chop your penis off and you'll feel fine.
[03:07:17.786 --> 03:07:19.128]  And vice versa for a female.
[03:07:19.848 --> 03:07:20.549]  Sterilization.
[03:07:20.689 --> 03:07:21.430]  Depopulation.
[03:07:22.501 --> 03:07:34.915]  It convinced millennials that homosexuality is totally fun and great, but they refuse to actually acknowledge that the spread of STDs and AIDS and HIV is gonna shorten your lifespan and they don't have the ability to repopulate.
[03:07:34.935 --> 03:07:35.636]  That's just a fact!
[03:07:38.132 --> 03:07:42.953]  And then they've also gone with other generations to convince them that you don't need to be involved with technology.
[03:07:42.993 --> 03:07:44.874]  Just let the kids do it for you.
[03:07:44.894 --> 03:07:51.596]  You don't need to learn how to use any piece of technology to learn so you could survive into the future.
[03:07:51.636 --> 03:07:53.956]  Just get a young kid to come in and do it for you.
[03:07:54.777 --> 03:07:59.558]  You do understand that the World Economic Forum even preys on that with some older generations?
[03:08:00.398 --> 03:08:03.739]  Yes, when they talk about technology, Klaus Schwab has talked about this many times.
[03:08:04.361 --> 03:08:08.342]  They believe if they're going to be masters of the future they need to be masters of technology.
[03:08:08.782 --> 03:08:34.749]   They've talked about this many times in their panels that they will be the ones to facilitate older generations to assist them to learn how to use the technologies of the future so they could be the ones to transition them and teach them and disciple them How to take those next generations, Gen X or Boomers, into the future to teach them how these technologies are meant to be used.
[03:08:34.789 --> 03:08:36.453]  No, how about you think for yourself?
[03:08:37.170 --> 03:08:38.551]  How about you learn for yourself?
[03:08:38.731 --> 03:08:48.057]  Why the hell do you need Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum and all these globalist entities to teach you how to use an iPhone or to teach you how to use a piece of technology?
[03:08:48.358 --> 03:08:54.261]  Never, never intellectually end up in a place where you are no longer learning or thinking for yourself.
[03:08:54.482 --> 03:08:55.722]  I don't care how old you are.
[03:08:55.963 --> 03:08:57.404]  I don't care how young you are.
[03:08:59.505 --> 03:09:05.469]  All of these people do is pontificate on how to control the entire world and they declare it.
[03:09:06.488 --> 03:09:10.489]  They declare it, the World Economic Forum president right there you see on your screen, Davos 2024.
[03:09:10.849 --> 03:09:11.970]  It never fails, guys.
[03:09:12.090 --> 03:09:15.671]  Every single year, one of them will declare a new world order.
[03:09:16.451 --> 03:09:19.532]  And he said, we are on the way to a new order.
[03:09:19.572 --> 03:09:23.773]  And he was actually asking a question to the panelists.
[03:09:24.413 --> 03:09:28.555]  He asked them, how do we, and I'm paraphrasing, how do we transition?
[03:09:28.595 --> 03:09:36.886]   If we're going to transition out of the world order from World War II, How do we transition safely into the new world order?
[03:09:37.406 --> 03:09:38.106]  Into the future?
[03:09:39.586 --> 03:09:42.707]  And see, this is what people need to see, and this is what people need to experience.
[03:09:42.887 --> 03:09:59.991]  I challenge every single one of you, and I challenge people every single year, since I've been on the air, and I've had a platform, and I've been blessed by God to be able to communicate to thousands of people every single day, which I'm thankful for, I challenge any single one of you, listen to Davos every single year.
[03:10:00.051 --> 03:10:06.365]   Listen to all their panels, listen to all of their speakers, Listen to everything they have to say in context.
[03:10:06.726 --> 03:10:08.266]  Listen to their own words.
[03:10:08.286 --> 03:10:09.046]  Don't listen to me.
[03:10:09.386 --> 03:10:13.307]  Don't listen to Alex Jones, or Owen Schroer, or Harrison Smith.
[03:10:13.487 --> 03:10:15.107]  You don't have to listen to any one of us.
[03:10:15.607 --> 03:10:23.089]  Go listen to these people for yourself, and you'll hear how psychotic they truly are with their globalist plans.
[03:10:23.409 --> 03:10:24.089]  We'll be right back.
[03:10:24.749 --> 03:10:25.950]  All right, InfoWarriors.
[03:10:26.250 --> 03:10:28.950]  If you're just tuning in, I'm your guest host, Drew Hernandez.
[03:10:28.990 --> 03:10:32.411]  You are now watching the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.

[03:11:05.623 --> 03:11:06.504]  Here's another example.
[03:11:07.125 --> 03:11:10.170]  They've coined a new term, by the way, in 2024, Ecoside.
[03:11:10.730 --> 03:11:14.356]  So this falls in line with the climate change death cult agenda.
[03:11:14.992 --> 03:11:17.755]  Because everything about the climate change, they're false prophets.
[03:11:17.835 --> 03:11:21.159]  They try to prophesy the end of the world every 12 years.
[03:11:21.179 --> 03:11:24.202]  It seems that they have an entire lifestyle.
[03:11:24.322 --> 03:11:25.724]  You can't drive a certain car.
[03:11:25.764 --> 03:11:27.185]  You can't have a certain toaster.
[03:11:27.225 --> 03:11:28.827]  You can't have a certain refrigerator.
[03:11:29.167 --> 03:11:31.370]  You can't have a certain air conditioner unit.
[03:11:31.970 --> 03:11:34.833]  Everything has to be green and eco-friendly.
[03:11:35.074 --> 03:11:36.015]  Absolutely everything.
[03:11:36.175 --> 03:11:36.936]  Even what you eat!
[03:11:37.572 --> 03:11:38.852]  Eating your food, okay?
[03:11:38.892 --> 03:11:40.613]  They're gonna ban everything at some point.
[03:11:41.013 --> 03:11:46.154]  Because everything creates too high of a carbon footprint, so we have to be zero emissions.
[03:11:47.035 --> 03:11:48.055]  Here's an example of that.
[03:11:48.075 --> 03:11:50.155]  This is Infowars.com, obviously.
[03:11:50.175 --> 03:11:57.757]  The most ridiculous 75 seconds of BS from Davos yet on Eco's side.
[03:11:57.777 --> 03:12:03.239]  So what's interesting about this is a new coin has been termed.
[03:12:04.683 --> 03:12:23.617]  A new term has been coined, excuse me, from Jojo Mehta, founder of Stop Ecoside Now, explains in her upper class English accent to her ultra rich peers in Davos that, quote, we have this cultural very ingrained habit of not taking damage to nature as seriously as we take damage to people or property.
[03:12:24.204 --> 03:12:25.385]  Definitely a tree hugger.
[03:12:25.545 --> 03:12:28.246]  This woman probably has sex with trees, not gonna lie.
[03:12:28.546 --> 03:12:35.710]  With human rights, mass murder and genocide are serious crimes, but there is no equivalent in the environmental space.
[03:12:36.310 --> 03:12:37.030]  Let me repeat that.
[03:12:37.091 --> 03:12:45.755]  She said, quote, with human rights, mass murder and genocide are serious crimes, but there is no equivalent in the environmental space.
[03:12:46.275 --> 03:12:57.116]   She went on to say, unlike an international crime like genocide that involves a specific intent with ecocide, That we see is that people are trying to do this.
[03:12:57.876 --> 03:13:02.458]  What people are trying to do is make money, farm and fish.
[03:13:03.158 --> 03:13:08.421]  And what's missing is an awareness of the side effects and collateral damage that happens.
[03:13:08.441 --> 03:13:09.421]  End quote.
[03:13:09.441 --> 03:13:11.402]  These are their own words, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:13:11.462 --> 03:13:28.957]   OK, so now these proxies and talking heads at the World Economic Forum Are now attempting to coin the new term and this is what they do just like the CIA coins conspiracy theory and pushes that on all the targets to shame and chastise and humiliate them and discredit them.
[03:13:29.477 --> 03:13:33.859]  They do the same thing with their psychological operations and now they've coined the term ecocide.
[03:13:34.921 --> 03:13:41.767]  And this psycho on the World Economic Forum stage is attempting, now think with her here, okay?
[03:13:41.787 --> 03:13:43.729]  Like really think how insane these people are.
[03:13:44.069 --> 03:13:54.377]  Attempting to equate and make equivalent homicide and genocide to whatever she declares is a crime against the environment.
[03:13:56.019 --> 03:14:00.903]  So whatever, like I said, they're very vague about their ideas and they're very vague about their operations.
[03:14:00.943 --> 03:14:10.915]   They don't detail them Um, in a full scale, like vivid 4K, 8K, just you see every single detail.
[03:14:10.935 --> 03:14:12.916]  They're very vague about their operations.
[03:14:12.936 --> 03:14:14.597]  They're very vague about their agendas.
[03:14:14.897 --> 03:14:15.838]  And this is just another one.
[03:14:15.858 --> 03:14:18.499]  Like I said, they get to determine down in the future.
[03:14:18.519 --> 03:14:23.422]  And these people, they influence legislation, not just in America, but worldwide.
[03:14:23.442 --> 03:14:28.044]  That's why all these globalist politicians will show up to this so they can carry their ideas.
[03:14:28.940 --> 03:14:35.984]  Okay, and spread them across the globe, and influence legislation in their own local or federal governments, whatever you name it.
[03:14:36.885 --> 03:14:41.507]  And so now ecocide has now become a thing, and I think this is, this is not a surprise to anybody.
[03:14:42.128 --> 03:14:53.674]  Where in the New World Order, in the climate change death cult, you commit crimes against the environment, you have too high of a carbon footprint, and ultimately you will always have some kind of a carbon footprint, because you are carbon-based.
[03:14:54.314 --> 03:14:57.859]   So at some point, You will be neutralized.
[03:14:58.019 --> 03:14:59.579]  And it's like what John Kerry said as well.
[03:14:59.619 --> 03:15:08.182]  John Kerry made it very clear that we'll reach zero emissions and no politician, no elected official is going to help you, is going to get us to those zero emissions.
[03:15:08.602 --> 03:15:09.283]  That's going to happen.
[03:15:09.303 --> 03:15:10.783]  The marketplace is going to do that.
[03:15:10.843 --> 03:15:26.650]   And they use these terms like marketplace and they use these terms like investors and shareholders when they're talking about their globalists and they're talking about the members of the World Economic Forum and Those that believe in the World Economic Forum's climate change, Green New Deal agenda.
[03:15:26.670 --> 03:15:30.073]  They call themselves shareholders and they call themselves the marketplace.
[03:15:30.133 --> 03:15:31.714]  It's very globalist and cultish.
[03:15:33.195 --> 03:15:34.957]  But John Kerry made that very clear as well.
[03:15:34.997 --> 03:15:44.324]  He declared that no democratically elected politician can stop the climate change agenda or enforce it or bring them down to zero emissions.
[03:15:44.524 --> 03:15:45.685]  So put those two together.
[03:15:46.283 --> 03:15:53.425]  You have one globalist satanic climate change death cult advocate saying, well we need to enforce ecocide.
[03:15:53.765 --> 03:16:00.127]  And if anyone commits a crime against the environment, well that's just as bad as committing genocide or homicide.
[03:16:00.547 --> 03:16:02.587]  Or you're just as bad as a serial killer.
[03:16:03.388 --> 03:16:04.248]  So what does that mean?
[03:16:04.388 --> 03:16:06.328]  I just have too high of a carbon footprint?
[03:16:07.149 --> 03:16:09.049]  I don't want to get a retarded EV?
[03:16:09.069 --> 03:16:15.414]   I don't want a smart house that's Climate or economically friendly.
[03:16:15.514 --> 03:16:18.076]  I don't want a home that's attached to the grid.
[03:16:18.396 --> 03:16:19.497]  I really don't like that stuff.
[03:16:19.537 --> 03:16:20.757]  I don't like any of that stuff.
[03:16:21.758 --> 03:16:23.579]  Because the government could have full access.
[03:16:23.859 --> 03:16:25.720]  Your home is connected directly.
[03:16:26.741 --> 03:16:29.722]  Your AC unit is connected directly to the internet.
[03:16:30.123 --> 03:16:32.424]  Your toaster, your refrigerator, everything.
[03:16:32.464 --> 03:16:35.586]  That's why they're pushing for full smart house technology.
[03:16:35.866 --> 03:16:37.487]  So it's on an internet grid.
[03:16:37.787 --> 03:16:42.790]  So when the government decides to flip that switch, they'll control your entire existence, including your bank account.
[03:16:43.553 --> 03:16:45.094]  That's why they're rolling out the CBDCs.
[03:16:45.515 --> 03:16:49.798]  Because they absolutely need that overarching, again, how did I start the broadcast?
[03:16:50.018 --> 03:16:51.479]  They have a god-like complex.
[03:16:51.519 --> 03:16:58.484]  They want to be all-powerful, omnipotent, over your entire life, and they'll use technology against you in order to accomplish that.
[03:16:59.485 --> 03:17:02.767]  And so Ecoside is definitely the future in their agenda.
[03:17:03.108 --> 03:17:07.471]  Well, they will enforce their climate change death cult laws on humanity.
[03:17:08.391 --> 03:17:09.572]  You violate a tree.
[03:17:09.953 --> 03:17:11.334]  You violate the environment.
[03:17:11.735 --> 03:17:13.877]  Your carbon footprint is not low enough here.
[03:17:14.217 --> 03:17:16.119]  You are emitting way too many emissions here.
[03:17:16.499 --> 03:17:18.822]  Well, it looks like that you're not going to be able to live.
[03:17:18.862 --> 03:17:22.005]  And John Kerry comes along and says, we'll reach those zero emissions.
[03:17:22.305 --> 03:17:22.786]  Trust us.
[03:17:23.046 --> 03:17:23.506]  We will.
[03:17:23.546 --> 03:17:24.147]  It's impossible.
[03:17:24.167 --> 03:17:24.988]  You're never going to get that.
[03:17:26.078 --> 03:17:27.239]  You're never going to get that.
[03:17:27.599 --> 03:17:33.624]  Mankind will have to absolutely, the globe, planet Earth will have to be erased entirely.
[03:17:34.025 --> 03:17:34.925]  That's the agenda.
[03:17:34.945 --> 03:17:36.767]  Depopulate, destroy humanity.
[03:17:36.947 --> 03:17:38.828]  Depopulate, destroy humanity.
[03:17:39.389 --> 03:17:43.773]  When John Kerry comes out, in my opinion, and says, we'll reach those zero emissions.
[03:17:44.793 --> 03:17:48.016]  Oh, we're going to, we're going to, we're going to depopulate the Earth.
[03:17:48.637 --> 03:17:50.078]  Oh, we will lower those emissions.
[03:17:50.558 --> 03:17:53.921]  Why do you think they have assisted suicides and programs in Canada?
[03:17:55.222 --> 03:17:57.305]  Why do you think they've been building FEMA camps?
[03:17:57.685 --> 03:17:59.547]  Alex Jones has been exposing this for decades.
[03:17:59.587 --> 03:18:03.652]  Why do you think they've been building FEMA camps for decades across the United States of America?
[03:18:03.972 --> 03:18:10.660]  Oh, it's, it's, it's, well, those FEMA camps are only in case we have some kind of crisis or natural disaster.
[03:18:10.841 --> 03:18:11.381]  Exactly.
[03:18:11.501 --> 03:18:12.062]  Exactly.
[03:18:12.142 --> 03:18:12.382]  Right.
[03:18:12.563 --> 03:18:14.325]  And who's pontificating the next?
[03:18:15.777 --> 03:18:24.945]  The next financial crisis due to AI or due to some kind of cybernetic attack, or who's pontificating or projecting the next pathogen that will be released?
[03:18:24.985 --> 03:18:27.987]  And we have another worldwide pandemic where everything has to be locked down.
[03:18:28.048 --> 03:18:34.493]  Who are all pontificating the next future crisis to happen within the next two decades?
[03:18:35.194 --> 03:18:40.158]  It's this satanic, Luciferian, globalist organization that believes that they are God.
[03:18:41.098 --> 03:18:42.678]  Who gets to play God?
[03:18:42.759 --> 03:18:46.660]  Who gets to fill the shoes of God and the universe?
[03:18:46.720 --> 03:18:47.880]  Who gets that position?
[03:18:48.860 --> 03:18:49.280]  None of us.
[03:18:50.341 --> 03:18:51.581]  But that's Satan's heart.
[03:18:52.561 --> 03:18:53.582]  He wants to be God.
[03:18:53.622 --> 03:18:57.523]  He wants to ascend above the heavens, ascend above the throne of God.
[03:18:57.563 --> 03:18:59.323]  He wants to act in the position of God.
[03:18:59.343 --> 03:19:02.284]  That's what got him thrown out of heaven and cast out.
[03:19:03.484 --> 03:19:05.105]  And that's why they all have the same heartbeat.
[03:19:05.771 --> 03:19:07.633]  That's why they all have the same veins.
[03:19:07.753 --> 03:19:11.357]  That's why they all have the same spirit, the same agenda, same mindset.
[03:19:11.557 --> 03:19:12.558]  They're all in unison.
[03:19:13.419 --> 03:19:19.325]  They're all in unison worldwide in their conferences, in their news conferences, in the media, in the culture.
[03:19:20.575 --> 03:19:27.920]  You name it, no matter where you look, education spaces, all these influential institutions, they all sound the same, they all sound the same, they have the same message.
[03:19:28.220 --> 03:19:31.022]  It's robotic, it's NPC, no matter what you want to call it.
[03:19:31.322 --> 03:19:34.345]  It is demonic, it is satanic, it is anti-Christ.
[03:19:34.625 --> 03:19:37.507]  That's why they're all on the same wavelength when it comes to these agendas.
[03:19:40.249 --> 03:19:46.333]  And, uh, the way that it's done, it's done, they claim, in your best interest in mind.
[03:19:47.668 --> 03:19:49.569]  They claim that they're here to protect you.
[03:19:49.949 --> 03:19:51.210]  We're here to save the world.
[03:19:51.550 --> 03:19:54.552]  We're here to protect you from disinformation and misinformation.
[03:19:54.932 --> 03:19:58.454]  We're here to enforce the law, because it's being neglected.
[03:19:58.474 --> 03:20:04.417]  And if we enforce laws like ecocide, well then the population is gonna fall in line.
[03:20:04.457 --> 03:20:09.320]  And actually, they probably actually believe it'll give them an excuse to commit actual mass genocide.
[03:20:10.740 --> 03:20:13.143]  That's where the thing is going to get warped, man.
[03:20:13.303 --> 03:20:15.485]  You commit ecocide?
[03:20:15.625 --> 03:20:21.251]  Well, that gives us an excuse to genocide humanity because your existence, you're not lowering your carbon footprint.
[03:20:21.391 --> 03:20:22.512]  Well, we're going to take you out.
[03:20:22.812 --> 03:20:23.894]  Off to the camp you go.
[03:20:24.254 --> 03:20:26.216]  Off to the assisted suicide center you go.
[03:20:26.616 --> 03:20:27.217]  Off you go.
[03:20:27.417 --> 03:20:27.978]  Off you go.
[03:20:27.998 --> 03:20:29.920]  Because we have to save the planet.
[03:20:30.821 --> 03:20:31.802]  Totally antichrist.
[03:20:32.422 --> 03:20:33.103]  It's satanic.
[03:20:33.843 --> 03:20:35.244]  I'll tell you that for damn sure.
[03:20:35.544 --> 03:20:36.685]  And you know what the good thing is?
[03:20:37.225 --> 03:20:42.928]  People are waking up to it, and people are realizing just exactly what this truly is.
[03:20:43.309 --> 03:20:44.309]  And it's deceptive.
[03:20:44.829 --> 03:20:45.970]  Well, my name is Drew Hernandez.
[03:20:45.990 --> 03:20:48.291]  Thank you guys for tuning in to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.

[03:20:52.294 --> 03:20:54.775]  The War Room is up next, so do not go anywhere.
[03:20:54.895 --> 03:20:56.616]  Share the broadcast everywhere.
[03:20:57.157 --> 03:20:59.398]  I actually feel sorry for the establishment.
[03:21:00.384 --> 03:21:03.947]  They're inbred, they were given the power they have, they're incompetent scum.
[03:21:04.407 --> 03:21:05.168]  Look at Lloyd Austin.
[03:21:06.088 --> 03:21:11.333]  And I remember when they stole the election in 2020.
[03:21:11.513 --> 03:21:16.016]  They told us we should never question another election again.
[03:21:16.677 --> 03:21:19.339]  But isn't that all Democrats have ever done?
[03:21:21.220 --> 03:21:24.523]  And isn't that what Hillary Clinton claimed Trump was going to do in 2020?
[03:21:25.644 --> 03:21:28.326]  She did that because she was butthurt.
[03:21:29.502 --> 03:21:35.423]  She did that because they printed up hundreds of thousands of copies of this Newsweek edition.
[03:21:35.884 --> 03:21:37.364]  It's an actual magazine framed in here.
[03:21:39.084 --> 03:21:44.306]  With her, the supposed 45th President of the United States.
[03:21:44.806 --> 03:21:46.606]  These people are a joke.
[03:21:47.706 --> 03:21:51.227]  They still think corporate media is important.
[03:21:51.267 --> 03:21:52.548]  Let's show folks an overhead shot of that.
[03:21:55.083 --> 03:21:58.505]  They still think being in the New York Times or on CNN is important.
[03:21:59.225 --> 03:22:01.386]  CNN has an average of 100,000 viewers.
[03:22:02.087 --> 03:22:03.347]  Their top show has 100,000.
[03:22:03.668 --> 03:22:08.210]  Joe Rogan has 30, 40, 50 million viewers a week conservatively.
[03:22:08.530 --> 03:22:09.050]  So do we.
[03:22:11.151 --> 03:22:17.795]  But why do we still see them, even myself, at some levels as the establishment?
[03:22:19.059 --> 03:22:20.320]  As the top of the game.
[03:22:20.540 --> 03:22:20.960]  They're not.
[03:22:21.060 --> 03:22:21.801]  They're a joke.
[03:22:22.341 --> 03:22:23.001]  They're a fraud.
[03:22:23.642 --> 03:22:28.905]  Before I shot this report, I saw this Time Magazine article.
[03:22:28.965 --> 03:22:30.086]  Who reads Time Magazine?
[03:22:30.386 --> 03:22:31.086]  Who looks at this?
[03:22:31.106 --> 03:22:31.687]  Who believes this?
[03:22:32.107 --> 03:22:37.270]  I bet the Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, will show a close shot of that.
[03:22:37.750 --> 03:22:40.232]  I bet he has this framed on his wall.
[03:22:41.553 --> 03:22:44.595]  The last place I'd want to be is on the cover of Time Magazine.
[03:22:44.935 --> 03:22:47.997]  It means you're an establishment loser or worse.
[03:22:48.956 --> 03:22:51.258]  The last place I want to be is in a Hollywood movie.
[03:22:51.578 --> 03:22:53.259]  The power structure is a joke.
[03:22:53.419 --> 03:22:53.959]  It's over.
[03:22:54.299 --> 03:22:54.880]  It's a fraud.
[03:22:54.900 --> 03:22:55.440]  So look at this.
[03:22:56.381 --> 03:23:02.125]  Just like they're trying to hold up Blinken, they tried to hold up Hillary Clinton.
[03:23:03.085 --> 03:23:07.588]  So I remind myself and I remind you of what a joke and what a fraud they are.
[03:23:08.289 --> 03:23:11.591]  And the fact that all their attempts to silence us and to silence you have failed.
[03:23:11.931 --> 03:23:15.449]   And now the whole world Is listening to what we're doing.
[03:23:16.069 --> 03:23:20.291]  And that credit goes to God and God through you, the viewers and listeners.
[03:23:20.732 --> 03:23:22.653]  You deserve the credit for this broadcast.
[03:23:23.133 --> 03:23:25.234]  You deserve the credit for what we've been able to do.
[03:23:25.734 --> 03:23:31.637]  But I want to encourage you to remember how important you are and that we're starting to win.
[03:23:31.837 --> 03:23:35.019]  But if you don't support the broadcast, we can fail.
[03:23:36.340 --> 03:23:37.241]  I need your support.
[03:23:37.421 --> 03:23:39.384]  I've got so many great plans we can execute.
[03:23:39.464 --> 03:23:41.146]  I've proven I'm in the game.
[03:23:41.186 --> 03:23:41.927]  I don't back down.
[03:23:42.147 --> 03:23:43.529]  We have victory in a bottle.
[03:23:43.809 --> 03:23:44.390]  Thanks to God.
[03:23:44.470 --> 03:23:45.211]  Thanks to your support.
[03:23:46.372 --> 03:23:48.214]  But I need you to make the decision.
