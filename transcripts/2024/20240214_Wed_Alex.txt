[00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:21.970]  What we want is a system that liberates individuals as meaningfully and as broadly as possible.
[00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.990]  That should be our guide.
[00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.051]  That's classically liberal!
[00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:34.332]  It is classically liberal and I believe it is also actually liberal and it is a perfect match for what I find my many conservative friends believe as well.
[00:00:34.532 --> 00:00:39.173]  That this is the metric that we can use to test any system that we put in place.
[00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:41.773]  Does it liberate people or does it constrain them?
[00:00:41.873 --> 00:00:45.854]   If it liberates them meaningfully over the long term, It's a good thing.
[00:00:47.755 --> 00:01:01.159]  What they have recognized is that they have no use for us, and I wish that was an exaggeration, but you can see this so clearly in what they did to the public over COVID.
[00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:04.380]  I don't think we really have any choice but to rescue Western civilization.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.821]  It is the best tool we've got, always has been.
[00:01:07.221 --> 00:01:19.570]   It's not to say that it can't use upgrading here and there, but We have to save it because your children, my children, and all of the grandchildren that we might ultimately have are depending on us to do it.
[00:01:20.626 --> 00:01:37.673]  And the idea of hyper-novelty is that although human beings are the fastest evolving animal species that has ever existed, and that is largely the result of the fact that we evolve in a different way, we are actually able to evolve culturally, which is much more rapid than genetic evolution.
[00:01:37.693 --> 00:01:48.420]   But even though we are the fastest evolving animal species that has existed, The rate of technological change is so fast that even our evolutionary capacity... We can't catch up.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:02:08.456]  We cannot keep up, and that is resulting in us being sick, physically, psychologically, socially, and what you're detecting as the collapse of civilization is really a manifestation of many different kinds of hyper-novelty that is making it difficult for us to see what's in our interest.
[00:02:08.996 --> 00:02:20.867]   They are gambling with A planet that isn't theirs to destroy, that is actually, it is the birthright of every living person and it is the entitlement of all the people who will eventually live here.
[00:02:20.948 --> 00:02:24.151]  They are gambling with it and they obviously don't know what they're doing.
[00:02:24.591 --> 00:02:35.025]   It is likely that many of the deaths that occur as a result of these shots It's the result of the mRNA platform itself.
[00:02:35.626 --> 00:02:41.066]   that anything you loaded onto that platform would produce many of these pathologies,
[00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:43.384]  because the platform itself is deeply flawed.
[00:02:43.384 --> 00:02:52.906]  [Music]
[00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:57.706]   Former professor Brett Weinstein is in studio with us for an in-depth interview.
[00:02:58.014 --> 00:03:02.677]  We're taping this on Sunday while everybody else is watching the Super Bowl.
[00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:04.919]  I'm really excited about this interview.
[00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.961]  I've been trying to get him on the show for a couple of years.
[00:03:07.981 --> 00:03:08.722]  He's a very busy guy.
[00:03:08.742 --> 00:03:15.666]  He was just in town for the Joe Rogan number one podcast in the world, which I'm sure will have already aired by the time this interview goes out.
[00:03:15.806 --> 00:03:17.548]  But I just want to point out, I love football.
[00:03:17.588 --> 00:03:17.928]  It's great.
[00:03:18.468 --> 00:03:24.290]  But our society is in so much trouble because of all the bread and circuses that people make their main focus sports and entertainment.
[00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.971]  That'd be fine if society and civilization wasn't in such a crisis.
[00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:36.453]  So I'm honored that he would spend Super Bowl Sunday that's a religion to so many, including my family that's all watching it right now and wondering why I'm not there.
[00:03:36.793 --> 00:03:40.034]  Well, it's because this, quite frankly, is way more important.
[00:03:40.054 --> 00:03:41.715]  A game comes, a game goes.
[00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:50.093]  But this affects the entire future of our species on this planet that has never been in greater crisis in my view.
[00:03:50.694 --> 00:04:03.038]  And when I first learned about the doctor and former professor at Evergreen University in 2017, he was standing up against really horrible racism against white people, saying they couldn't be on campus on certain days.
[00:04:03.598 --> 00:04:10.903]  I just want to remind folks of where we really started seeing this guy explode out there, and since then he's obviously been everywhere.
[00:04:10.923 --> 00:04:15.966]  One of the top guests on Joe Rogan has his own hit podcast as well that everybody should search out.
[00:04:16.306 --> 00:04:17.767]  It's the Dark Horse Podcast.
[00:04:17.787 --> 00:04:23.391]  We'll put all that on screen for folks, darkhorse.locals.com and also on Rumble.
[00:04:23.791 --> 00:04:30.416]   And it's a show that I routinely watch because I do a lot of research, but I I certainly don't know a lot of what's going on in the world.
[00:04:30.476 --> 00:04:33.899]  It was a famous Greek philosopher said, I know nothing.
[00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.223]  Anybody that tells you that they know everything is either a fool or a liar.
[00:04:38.263 --> 00:04:40.064]  The more you learn, the more you don't know.
[00:04:40.384 --> 00:04:45.528]  But I learned a lot from Dr. Brett Weinstein, and it's great to have him here with us.
[00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:48.711]  Now, I've literally got dozens of topics I want to hit.
[00:04:48.771 --> 00:04:52.714]  Everybody knows half the time I do an interview, it's me doing half the talking.
[00:04:53.095 --> 00:04:56.718]  I really want to give you, doctor, a chance to start wherever you want.
[00:04:57.158 --> 00:05:02.758]   to cover the borders. You were just out at the Darien Gap with investigative journalist
[00:05:02.758 --> 00:05:07.478]   and war correspondent Michael Yon. You just did an amazing podcast with Tucker Carlson.
[00:05:07.478 --> 00:05:12.278]   I watched the whole thing once and then watched the clips again. We played them on the show.
[00:05:12.278 --> 00:05:16.677]   You really nailed what's happening. And we were just talking before we started taping.
[00:05:16.677 --> 00:05:19.237]  You said, "Listen, we have to save Western civilization."
[00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.111]  We're in a crisis.
[00:05:20.151 --> 00:05:23.375]  We've got to transcend these labels of left and right.
[00:05:23.755 --> 00:05:24.777]  I totally agree with you.
[00:05:24.797 --> 00:05:26.919]  So we're going to cover the waterfront here today.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.664]  And I really appreciate you taking the time to make yourself available.
[00:05:31.105 --> 00:05:32.346]  So let's start.
[00:05:33.524 --> 00:05:34.205]  Well, thanks.
[00:05:34.245 --> 00:05:37.007]  I'm really glad to be here and to meet you, finally.
[00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:41.130]  I've long been a fan of yours, if a bit cryptically.
[00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.392]  And in fact, maybe that is a place to start.
[00:05:46.654 --> 00:05:53.439]  Many years ago, I guess it would have been something like 2011, I was part of the Occupy Movement.
[00:05:53.539 --> 00:06:01.528]   And although the Occupy Movement got ridiculous quickly, And I wish I had realized where it was headed earlier.
[00:06:01.548 --> 00:06:19.159]  I was paying attention actually to your coverage of it and something that impressed and surprised me was that as the Occupy movement was being targeted by the federal government, you covered that targeting and you were incensed by it.
[00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:40.313]   And I was heartened to see you defending people who obviously ideologically were not closely aligned Uh, with you, and I felt, I felt at the time, and I feel even more strongly now, that you're a patriot, and I really appreciate that you see, uh, all Americans as worth defending.
[00:06:40.593 --> 00:06:41.554]  So, thank you for that.
[00:06:41.674 --> 00:06:46.117]  Well, thank you, but look, if, if I don't defend everybody, I'm not going to get defended.
[00:06:46.137 --> 00:06:55.743]  It was that famous, you know, quote by the pastor in Nazi Germany that he didn't stand up for this group when they came after him, then he'd stand up for that group, and finally, when they came for him, there was nobody left to stand up for him.
[00:06:56.423 --> 00:07:01.165]  I exactly agree with this, and I think that really is the team that needs to assemble.
[00:07:01.386 --> 00:07:04.867]  All of the patriots who respect the principles on which the U.S.
[00:07:04.927 --> 00:07:15.293]  was founded, and indeed the Western civilization is founded, need to put aside ideological differences so that we can fend off what threatens Western civilization.
[00:07:15.813 --> 00:07:21.156]  And at the point that we've succeeded in doing that, we can go back to fighting over ideological issues.
[00:07:21.256 --> 00:07:23.237]  But for the moment, they're beside the point.
[00:07:23.991 --> 00:07:44.629]  Now, I didn't really go into your bio, and most people know who you are and they know a lot about you, but maybe we should just real quick talk about your background, what you've done, your best-selling book, The Hunter-Gatherer's Guide, The 21st Century, and then kind of your political process and what you would call yourself today, and then let's talk about that big attack on Western civilization and then launch into wherever you want to go.
[00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:46.319]  Sure.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.022]  You want me to tell people my background?
[00:07:49.383 --> 00:07:50.263]  Just about yourself, yeah.
[00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:50.484]  Sure.
[00:07:51.184 --> 00:07:53.487]  I'm an evolutionary biologist.
[00:07:53.887 --> 00:08:01.475]  I studied bats as part of my dissertation work, but that work led me quickly to the study of biological trade-offs.
[00:08:01.935 --> 00:08:08.220]   That is to say, Oftentimes anybody who's managed a system knows that you can't have everything.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.322]  You have to borrow from one thing in order to accomplish something else.
[00:08:11.782 --> 00:08:14.384]  And it turns out that that's the way biology functions too.
[00:08:14.944 --> 00:08:25.411]  So anyway, that became my focus and it has an important implication to this day in terms of how I see civilization and other complex systems functioning.
[00:08:26.525 --> 00:08:33.292]  I taught for 14 years at the Evergreen State College, which was a very strange place.
[00:08:33.632 --> 00:08:37.977]  It was the most liberal college in the country, I believe, by almost any measure.
[00:08:38.996 --> 00:08:44.079]  And there was a lot to it that was crazy, but there was also a lot to it that was quite brilliant.
[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:52.765]  The founders of the college had thrown out every single structure that would exist in a normal college or university and replaced it with something else.
[00:08:53.346 --> 00:09:04.473]  And half of what they built didn't really work, but half of it actually allowed for professors who were very serious about teaching to innovate entirely new ways of doing that.
[00:09:04.693 --> 00:09:08.256]  We had total freedom to teach anything we wanted in any way we wanted.
[00:09:08.954 --> 00:09:11.615]  Students took one class at a time, full-time.
[00:09:11.795 --> 00:09:14.357]  Professors taught one class at a time, full-time.
[00:09:14.677 --> 00:09:20.560]  And that meant that we knew every student, not just by name, but we knew who they were and how they thought.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:28.363]  And that allowed us to teach right to each individual, which is a very powerful way of doing it.
[00:09:28.663 --> 00:09:42.289]   That strong connection with students is why When I was confronted May 23rd of 2017 by 50 students that I had never met accusing me of racism, I wasn't concerned.
[00:09:43.035 --> 00:09:48.177]  There were too many people who knew that that accusation had no reality to it.
[00:09:49.018 --> 00:09:50.779]  And so I knew it wasn't going to stick.
[00:09:50.999 --> 00:09:52.720]  So that allowed me to stand up to them.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:59.723]  And the protesters who came after me made the mistake of proudly filming everything they did.
[00:10:00.023 --> 00:10:13.827]   And when they released that footage to the internet, people looked at me being confronted by students who weren't willing to even have a conversation with me and they knew something was wrong in this uh... diversity equity and inclusion
[00:10:13.827 --> 00:10:18.626]   movement just interrupt it felt like a malice struggle section
[00:10:18.626 --> 00:10:22.747]   i think it it was in every way except that the students who were confronting
[00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:27.146]   me i don't think you very much about now but and every other way yes
[00:10:27.146 --> 00:10:31.932]   did go in search So, anyway, I was teaching evolutionary biology.
[00:10:32.813 --> 00:10:41.179]  The college had hired a new president who was interested in remaking the college according to very different rules.
[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:47.824]  But he had a problem, because at Evergreen, the faculty had the power to stop him.
[00:10:48.465 --> 00:11:07.348]   And so he Effectively used racism to eliminate his opponents and I became public enemy number one not because there was anything wrong with my teaching but because I was going to be an obstacle to his plans and that resulted in the dramatic
[00:11:10.118 --> 00:11:16.445]  Dialectic means you are using disagreement to discover what is true.
[00:11:16.805 --> 00:11:18.026]  I am not interested in debate.
[00:11:18.206 --> 00:11:23.131]  I am interested only in dialectic, which does mean I listen to you and you listen to me.
[00:11:24.933 --> 00:11:28.474]  You don't care what terms you want to speak on.
[00:11:28.494 --> 00:11:29.715]  This is not about you.
[00:11:29.735 --> 00:11:34.257]  We are not speaking on terms of white privilege.
[00:11:34.917 --> 00:11:36.218]  This is not a discussion.
[00:11:36.238 --> 00:11:37.498]  You have lost that one.
[00:11:37.779 --> 00:11:40.280]  I am talking about terms that serve the truth.
[00:11:40.419 --> 00:11:42.419]  Those are the top five.
[00:11:42.419 --> 00:11:44.419]  Can I tell you where it's from?
[00:11:44.419 --> 00:11:48.419]   House of Donna Lickner, you said some racist sh*t. Can you apologize?
[00:11:48.824 --> 00:11:49.164]  I did not.
[00:11:49.184 --> 00:11:52.446]  Do I think that black students in sciences are targeted here?
[00:11:52.466 --> 00:11:54.467]  Do I think they're targeted anywhere?
[00:11:54.286 --> 00:11:58.286]  [inaudible]
[00:11:58.286 --> 00:12:02.286]   Do I think that black students in sciences are targeted here?
[00:12:02.286 --> 00:12:04.286]  Do I think they're targeted anywhere?
[00:12:04.286 --> 00:12:07.286]  [inaudible]
[00:12:07.286 --> 00:12:12.286]   Okay, I do not believe that students of color are targeted in the sciences here.
[00:12:12.286 --> 00:12:13.286]  Why?
[00:12:13.341 --> 00:12:16.700]  But maybe I misunderstand what you mean by targeted.
[00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:17.821]  Targeted by racism.
[00:12:17.821 --> 00:12:18.860]  Oh my God.
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.860]  What the f*** is wrong with you?
[00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.860]  Use your back and go to the police.
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.860]  Wait a second.
[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:29.980]   To me, targeted means something different than what I just heard you define it as.
[00:12:30.059 --> 00:12:37.202]  I do not believe that anybody on our faculty with intent specially targets people of color.
[00:12:37.262 --> 00:12:41.564]  That's exactly what you got to say!
[00:12:41.383 --> 00:12:49.182]  I didn't hear you at the beginning.
[00:12:49.261 --> 00:12:53.923]  Your protest of Day of Absence, you're prepping to take it as a protest, if you will?
[00:12:54.383 --> 00:12:58.244]  That's what you said in your email?
[00:12:58.304 --> 00:12:59.384]  May I answer that question?
[00:13:00.284 --> 00:13:08.227]  Wait a second, first of all, first of all, Day of Absence has been here longer than I have.
[00:13:08.146 --> 00:13:22.585]   I have never protested it until the idea No
[00:13:22.585 --> 00:13:30.586]   So this sounds like almost like also like a French Revolution
[00:13:30.586 --> 00:13:36.775]   Purge going on that once they killed the royalty and the rest of it, then it was just inner factions battling for
[00:13:36.775 --> 00:13:48.026]   control [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:13:39.062 --> 00:13:43.124]  Yes, all of these things have historical echoes.
[00:13:43.364 --> 00:13:51.247]  There were elements of what happened at Evergreen that were new, but of course most of it was just a refresh of historical chapters.
[00:13:52.167 --> 00:13:55.608]  And, you know, it was about something else.
[00:13:55.689 --> 00:14:06.893]  Race became an excuse for a battle that was desired by powerful forces that weren't interested in sharing their plan with the faculty, students, or anybody else.
[00:14:07.393 --> 00:14:17.195]  It seemed like Evergreen wetted the mouth too, or the taste buds, because then it seemed to be like the bellwether and then it spread across academia everywhere and was defended by the media.
[00:14:17.595 --> 00:14:26.677]  Now here we are, six, seven years later, now everybody who's got to have a brain, the vast majority say, no, academia, major colleges have turned into nut houses.
[00:14:27.678 --> 00:14:29.438]  Well, the fact is they were.
[00:14:30.287 --> 00:14:33.929]  They were already, and indeed that wasn't new either.
[00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:49.800]  When Heather, my wife, also a biologist, also actually she was Evergreen's most popular professor, but when we were in college ourselves, we faced the first iteration of what would later go on to be called diversity, equity, and inclusion.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.042]  At the time it was political correctness.
[00:14:52.662 --> 00:14:55.083]  And it had taken over anthropology.
[00:14:55.364 --> 00:15:02.388]  And when Heather and I took an anthropology course, we found an evolutionary perspective unwelcome.
[00:15:02.708 --> 00:15:04.129]  And so we fought back against that.
[00:15:04.149 --> 00:15:09.932]  I actually failed the course because the professor was not interested in having any pushback.
[00:15:10.433 --> 00:15:13.495]  But in any case, this has been going on for decades.
[00:15:13.655 --> 00:15:22.179]   And it finally completely took over the universities and has left them In a state that's actually totally upside down.
[00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:25.820]  I mean, it used to be that universities made students smarter.
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.201]  Now they're actually making them fools.
[00:15:29.301 --> 00:15:36.143]  They're teaching them things that just simply aren't true and enforcing their acceptance of those things.
[00:15:36.243 --> 00:15:40.484]  Like trying to make biologists tell their class that two men can have a baby?
[00:15:41.496 --> 00:15:41.976]  Precisely.
[00:15:42.076 --> 00:15:52.799]  I mean, this is just so biologically nonsensical that you would imagine every university in the country would have a group of biologists saying, I don't know how you reached that conclusion, but it just isn't right.
[00:15:52.939 --> 00:15:58.240]  And yet, one struggles to find any university in which anybody is standing up against such claims.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.321]  And that's really because the ones who would stand up have been forced out.
[00:16:02.742 --> 00:16:03.402]  Two words.
[00:16:04.442 --> 00:16:05.142]  Nitric boost.

[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:29.723]  What it does with the vasodilation alone, not to mention the immune system, exercise performance, you name it.
[00:16:30.743 --> 00:16:31.383]  It's incredible.

[00:17:01.451 --> 00:17:04.371]  Wow, so thanks for spending some time on that.
[00:17:04.371 --> 00:17:07.391]  There's so many places to segue, so many places.
[00:17:07.391 --> 00:17:14.091]   Walk us through then in the present world and how you would describe just in a larger,
[00:17:14.091 --> 00:17:18.132]   just stalled, the world today, and why you're so concerned about,
[00:17:18.132 --> 00:17:20.512]  really, the collapse of civilization.
[00:17:20.591 --> 00:17:20.891]  Sure.
[00:17:22.052 --> 00:17:27.863]   There's a feature of complex systems that I think people don't really appreciate.
[00:17:28.464 --> 00:17:36.550]  There are many systems that are incredibly powerful, like Western civilization, but they are also in their own way fragile.
[00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:42.114]  The fact is, certain conditions have to be present in order for Western civilization to function.
[00:17:42.494 --> 00:17:45.236]  The consent of the governed being key among them.
[00:17:45.396 --> 00:17:48.939]  We have to be able to throw people out when they don't do the job correctly.
[00:17:49.419 --> 00:18:01.028]   And to the extent that That control of the citizenry over governance is considered threatening by people who wish to use governance for their own objectives.
[00:18:01.508 --> 00:18:14.498]  They subvert democracy and they leave us with something in which, yes, elections take place, but our ability to control in which direction policy moves is ever less obvious.
[00:18:15.138 --> 00:18:16.119]  So that's where we are.
[00:18:16.159 --> 00:18:25.462]  We've got a system with no rudder or if there is a rudder it's under the control of something that we can't see headed in some direction we don't know.
[00:18:26.863 --> 00:18:33.239]   And there's thousands of parallels to this but The globalists can't win this fight against humanity if the people have a voice.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.762]  And Band-Odd Video is one of the most important voices out there.
[00:18:37.022 --> 00:18:44.308]  So share this report you're watching and also financially support its sponsor that has great products at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:18:44.648 --> 00:18:46.029]  Again, thanks for keeping us on air.
[00:18:46.309 --> 00:18:49.251]  Please share the video and please visit InfoWareStore.com.
[00:18:51.403 --> 00:19:01.968]  The insanity that's been incubating or chastening inside of the colleges and funded by the big corporations, I guess is a mode of control, has spilt out.
[00:19:02.008 --> 00:19:09.512]  The FAA is going to try to put schizophrenics flying jumbo jets and they're literally going to hire mentally handicapped people.
[00:19:09.792 --> 00:19:12.053]  When I first saw that news a few months ago, I didn't believe it.
[00:19:12.093 --> 00:19:12.853]  I went and looked it up.
[00:19:13.193 --> 00:19:20.538]   Now they have What do you think are some of the key points that we need to remember as we embark on this challenge going forward?
[00:19:20.357 --> 00:19:24.137]   make everybody uncomfortable but we're not gonna go for who the best pilots are
[00:19:24.137 --> 00:19:28.537]   and you're watching this just thinking I don't care if they're black or white or
[00:19:28.537 --> 00:19:32.417]   older young or gay or straight or male or female but you better damn well pass
[00:19:32.417 --> 00:19:33.897]  the highest test scores.
[00:19:33.897 --> 00:19:40.196]   What do you think are some of the key points that we need to remember as we embark on this challenge going forward?
[00:19:40.196 --> 00:19:46.617]   Your whole program is very heavily male dominated. It just is.
[00:19:45.023 --> 00:19:47.185]  And really it is white male dominated.
[00:19:47.305 --> 00:19:49.387]  I mean, let's just say what it is.
[00:19:49.807 --> 00:19:50.768]  And so let's be willing.
[00:19:51.529 --> 00:19:54.291]  That is today what it is.
[00:19:54.751 --> 00:20:06.790]   And then let's talk about what could the future look like if you really had this program that was representative of the whole country, right, of the whole world.
[00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:12.350]   And sometimes those are challenging or difficult, or I would say people get a little bit uncomfortable
[00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:18.309]   talking about that and like, hey, we're not gonna make change
[00:20:18.309 --> 00:20:20.750]  unless we get a little bit uncomfortable.
[00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:24.310]   And let's be uncomfortable together and let's do the right things
[00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:26.510]  and support each other moving forward.
[00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:27.870]  This is insane.
[00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:33.471]   Well, when I was driven out of Evergreen in the early days after that,
[00:20:33.471 --> 00:20:39.269]   I was asked to speak in numerous places about the free speech crisis on college campuses.
[00:20:39.557 --> 00:20:50.885]  And at some point, I ended up testifying to Congress on this, and I told them the same thing I had said each other time I'd been asked, which is, it's not a free speech crisis, and it's not about college campuses.
[00:20:51.245 --> 00:20:53.006]  That's simply the first place you're seeing it.
[00:20:54.008 --> 00:21:25.612]   This is somehow an attack on Western civilization and the wrong-headed ideas that are alarming when you see them in a classroom become dangerous when they migrate out into civilization and they take over engineering firms, they take over literally everything because almost all of the important jobs in civilization are done by people who passed through these colleges and were ideologically captured as they went through.
[00:21:25.912 --> 00:21:35.441]   There is no question That those wrong-headed ideas are going to destroy everything that functions if we don't get our wits about us quickly.
[00:21:35.461 --> 00:21:35.781]  And even then...
[00:21:38.883 --> 00:21:43.387]  Even then, you're talking about a problem that is going to take a couple of generations to correct.
[00:21:43.668 --> 00:21:57.500]  Even if we started doing everything right today, we have to clear the people who are so confused about the way mathematics and biology work, and we have to put people in important positions who know what's going on.
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:04.327]  But given the complete collapse of the university system, there isn't an obvious source for those clear-headed people.
[00:22:05.103 --> 00:22:12.908]  And Doctor, that's one kind of level I'd say down at the grassroots, 1,000-foot level, 500-foot level, 100-foot level.
[00:22:13.528 --> 00:22:19.812]  But I saw you on Tucker Carlson's podcast, I think he went further, I've never seen you, saying, no, this is very dark, this is very planned.
[00:22:20.673 --> 00:22:29.372]   If you go up to the million-foot level and look down, And you listen to Klaus Schwab and the globalists, they say, we're building a post-industrial world.
[00:22:29.532 --> 00:22:31.475]  We have to have an angrier world to blow it up.
[00:22:31.495 --> 00:22:33.698]  And we're going to do this for depopulation.
[00:22:33.718 --> 00:22:44.779]   And then somehow they're going to try to like secret away the knowledge in some Alexandrian vault and then roll it out later.
[00:22:44.779 --> 00:22:48.459]   And I'm a lay historian, just a common sense guy that researches and I've talked to a lot
[00:22:48.459 --> 00:22:54.259]   of other experts in every field, military, finance, you name it.
[00:22:54.259 --> 00:22:55.259]  They say no.
[00:22:55.259 --> 00:22:59.658]   If they keep cutting off fertilizer and food and if they continue to be stabilizing Western
[00:22:59.658 --> 00:23:04.658]   countries and collapse those, the war games go from horrible to Armageddon into the world.
[00:23:04.658 --> 00:23:09.759]   So I mean we're talking about cataclysms and then you've got all these big billionaires
[00:23:09.759 --> 00:23:16.379]   like Zuckerberg and others building huge underground bunkers and then all the locals built it and
[00:23:16.379 --> 00:23:19.979]   hate them and say as soon as things go to hell, and I'm literally in Hawaii.
[00:23:20.704 --> 00:23:24.704]   and ran into the main contractor and then the workers and all of them saying we're going to
[00:23:24.704 --> 00:23:28.784]   go get that son of a bitch. And they're telling me this and I'm like, you know, I'm a, can I say
[00:23:28.784 --> 00:23:34.463]   that? Well, don't say our names. And I'm just sitting there watching them building this Bastille
[00:23:34.463 --> 00:23:39.824]   that's about to be raided in a new French revolution. And these globalists think everything
[00:23:39.824 --> 00:23:46.625]   stolen all the wealth, consolidated power created a oligarchical fascist, you know, system with their
[00:23:46.625 --> 00:23:50.865]   computers and their flash trading and you know, this vertical integration and they're going to
[00:23:50.865 --> 00:23:56.625]   use some leftist ideology, try to control people when what they're doing is just scientific.
[00:23:57.578 --> 00:24:08.185]  Insanity, scientific consolidation for the consolidation, and then they think their plan of imploding civilization, that somehow they're not going to have blowback from that?
[00:24:08.505 --> 00:24:13.209]  They are going, and again, they thought they could do all this and never be the target.
[00:24:13.609 --> 00:24:27.118]  They thought we would all kill each other, but now that we've identified the globalists, and most thinking people now know about them, and there's a huge mass accelerated awakening happening that no one can deny, they should know your plan would never have worked before.
[00:24:27.778 --> 00:24:29.219]  One chance out of a thousand in my view.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:40.527]  Now there's no way it works, but as you said, if we tried to put the brakes on this and the globalists and the elites suddenly realized how insane they were, it'll take generations to turn it around.
[00:24:40.828 --> 00:24:44.330]  They've already set in motion a countdown to doomsday.
[00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:46.311]  I mean, I don't, I've got four children.
[00:24:46.632 --> 00:24:49.574]  I want to fix this, but I am mightily freaked out.
[00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:51.191]  Yeah, I agree.
[00:24:51.832 --> 00:25:01.020]  My impression is that they are clever enough to wreck the systems that work, and they are far from clever enough to rebuild something in their wake.
[00:25:01.441 --> 00:25:05.204]  So yeah, I think they are heading us for disaster.
[00:25:06.125 --> 00:25:13.368]  And that they are going to discover how much hubris has been driving them when it's too late for them.
[00:25:13.708 --> 00:25:17.169]  But I don't think we really have any choice but to rescue Western civilization.
[00:25:17.449 --> 00:25:19.610]  It is the best tool we've got, always has been.
[00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:32.374]  It's not to say that it can't use upgrading here and there, but we have to save it because your children, my children, and all of the grandchildren that we might ultimately have are depending on us to do it.
[00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:43.558]  The way you just took my three-minute rant and crystallized it in 30 seconds, that's why I'm a fan.
[00:25:44.719 --> 00:25:48.242]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[00:25:48.642 --> 00:25:55.668]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of, is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[00:25:55.848 --> 00:25:57.849]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[00:25:58.009 --> 00:25:59.070]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[00:25:59.090 --> 00:25:59.811]  He loved the idea.
[00:26:00.131 --> 00:26:03.652]  What would you call the debates and discussions about a pro-human future?
[00:26:03.672 --> 00:26:04.553]  Just Team Humanity?
[00:26:04.613 --> 00:26:05.493]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[00:26:05.653 --> 00:26:06.113]  Absolutely.
[00:26:06.413 --> 00:26:07.794]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[00:26:07.874 --> 00:26:11.295]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[00:26:11.555 --> 00:26:18.978]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to keep InfoWars on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[00:26:19.238 --> 00:26:30.969]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a revolution against the globalists, and it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:32.591]  We're told humans are the problem.
[00:26:32.611 --> 00:26:33.612]  We're told we're killing the Earth.
[00:26:33.872 --> 00:26:38.156]  We're told all this garbage, so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[00:26:38.456 --> 00:26:39.157]  We're not going to do that.
[00:26:39.417 --> 00:26:44.042]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at mfulworestore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[00:26:44.922 --> 00:26:45.963]  In fact, I'm going to shut up now.
[00:26:46.043 --> 00:26:46.723]  So let's just go.
[00:26:46.743 --> 00:26:47.344]  Where do you want to go?
[00:26:47.384 --> 00:26:52.267]  Darien Gap, The Collapse of the Borders, The Great Microcosm, The Wars, Tucker Carlson and Putin.
[00:26:52.307 --> 00:26:54.148]  I mean, there's just, go wherever you want, Doctor.
[00:26:54.509 --> 00:27:01.073]  Well, let's cover something you asked up front, which is how do I see myself politically?
[00:27:01.293 --> 00:27:07.117]  Because I think this is going to be an important potential sticking point for your audience, and it shouldn't be.
[00:27:07.797 --> 00:27:13.279]  So, let's say the worst part up front, which is that I regard myself not just as a liberal, but as a radical.
[00:27:13.719 --> 00:27:24.362]  Now, I describe myself as a reluctant radical because I've studied complex systems and I know that any attempt to improve things invites the danger of unintended consequences.
[00:27:24.642 --> 00:27:30.364]  This is the problem for liberal thought, is that when you try to fix things, you create phenomena you don't see coming.
[00:27:31.204 --> 00:27:38.490]  So I'm aware of that and I would not be enthusiastic about changing a system that works if I didn't think that we had to do it.
[00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:47.096]  That the system that we have built is not capable of managing the scale of the processes that we are utilizing today.
[00:27:47.517 --> 00:27:49.198]  So we have no choice but to change.
[00:27:49.378 --> 00:27:52.320]  But we should be very careful about the unintended consequences.
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:28:00.667]  We should go in with our eyes open and we should monitor the consequences of what we're doing so that we know when we're making an error and we can stop as quickly as possible.
[00:28:01.724 --> 00:28:03.005]  It's not that I want to fix the prior system.
[00:28:02.845 --> 00:28:10.204]   to change the previous system and fix problems, but this new Klaus Schwab fix is not the fix,
[00:28:10.204 --> 00:28:11.203]  it's death.
[00:28:11.203 --> 00:28:12.203]  It's death.
[00:28:12.203 --> 00:28:13.203]  It is death.
[00:28:13.203 --> 00:28:15.284]  And it's not that I want to fix the prior system.
[00:28:15.284 --> 00:28:21.884]   Frankly, I think the prior system was pretty amazing and that what I ideally would like
[00:28:21.884 --> 00:28:28.444]   is for that system to go through a process of upgrading slightly so that we could detect
[00:28:28.444 --> 00:28:30.085]  the consequences of what we're changing.
[00:28:30.449 --> 00:28:34.915]  I just think at this point, civilization has technologically changed.
[00:28:35.734 --> 00:28:42.296]  to an extent that many of our governance principles are inadequate for dealing with the risks.
[00:28:42.496 --> 00:28:46.136]  And you know, you can see this in the COVID crisis, for example.
[00:28:47.277 --> 00:28:59.582]   The biology involved in understanding the risks of the mRNA shots, for example, is pretty deep and protecting Informed consent.
[00:28:59.722 --> 00:29:09.035]  Informed consent, in fact, needs to be, in some sense, upgraded and enhanced because of the types of risks involved in a novel technology like that.
[00:29:10.218 --> 00:29:13.620]  So, in any case, I'm not enthusiastic about changing civilization.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:19.563]  I'm a huge fan of what we had going, but technology is going to force our hand and we need to be careful.
[00:29:19.583 --> 00:29:20.283]  I understand that.
[00:29:20.403 --> 00:29:22.385]  You're not trying to fix problems with the old system.
[00:29:22.405 --> 00:29:29.748]  You're saying it's colliding with all these great new changes in automation, robotics, and super computing, and quantum computing, and all the rest of it.
[00:29:29.788 --> 00:29:31.289]  So, we have to be honest.
[00:29:31.309 --> 00:29:34.591]  And instead, Klaus Schwab and those guys literally go, it's magic!
[00:29:35.151 --> 00:29:46.931]  Once the AI is in control, we'll fix it, but we've got to bulldoze everything that was already there, because we're going to imagine this big beautiful palace we're going to build, and then it's creating a perfect storm, like a black hole of destruction.
[00:29:47.506 --> 00:29:57.375]  Yes, and I would say the way to think of the problem is to separate the values from the structures and mechanisms that bring them about.
[00:29:57.636 --> 00:30:06.284]  And this is a place where I believe that there is no distinction between properly thinking liberals and properly thinking conservatives.
[00:30:06.784 --> 00:30:13.188]  What we want is a system that liberates individuals as meaningfully and as broadly as possible.
[00:30:13.548 --> 00:30:15.189]  That should be our guide.
[00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:16.310]  That's classically liberal!
[00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:25.535]  It is classically liberal and I believe it is also actually liberal and it is a perfect match for what I find my many conservative friends believe as well.
[00:30:25.735 --> 00:30:30.318]  That this is the metric that we can use to test any system that we put in place.
[00:30:30.758 --> 00:30:32.980]  Does it liberate people or does it constrain them?
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:37.043]  If it liberates them meaningfully over the long term, it's a good thing.
[00:30:37.603 --> 00:30:38.724]  And I do mean meaningfully.
[00:30:38.784 --> 00:30:44.989]  I'm not talking about people being liberated to frivolously engage nonsense.
[00:30:45.529 --> 00:30:52.835]  I'm talking about people who actually have enough power over their lives that they can pursue meaning or beauty and compassion.
[00:30:52.895 --> 00:30:53.956]  All of the best things about you.
[00:30:53.976 --> 00:30:54.576]  Human empowerment.
[00:30:54.756 --> 00:30:55.637]  Yep, exactly.
[00:30:56.177 --> 00:30:57.779]  So just my little thought on this.
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:06.284]  Only because I've read the writings of the think tanks, the Gates Funds, and the UN, the people that are running it, and Klaus Schwab, the Club of Rome.
[00:31:06.604 --> 00:31:07.965]  They just say humans are done.
[00:31:08.286 --> 00:31:09.126]  There's too many of them.
[00:31:10.447 --> 00:31:12.628]  When you get a bunch of freedom, you become decadent trash.
[00:31:12.988 --> 00:31:21.594]  We want to bring feudalism back for whoever we let live, and then we're going to sit up here like Mount Olympus and direct... I mean, it's the Hunger Games, but in the real world.
[00:31:22.274 --> 00:31:26.017]  And so that's why they want to destabilize the human system so that we're so...
[00:31:27.168 --> 00:31:34.847]   Inept that we've got to have machines come in to basically run our lives as a process of them phasing out the human
[00:31:34.847 --> 00:31:37.177]   era As you've all know her already talks about you know the
[00:31:37.177 --> 00:31:43.078]   post human world the world's the future is not human And again you look at that. It's it's not working that that
[00:31:43.078 --> 00:31:48.038]   plan would never work in my view And it's incredibly risky plus billions of people aren't
[00:31:48.038 --> 00:31:52.768]   gonna go along with that's called war. Please welcome you Val Noah Harari
[00:31:52.768 --> 00:32:04.018]   *Applause* Covid is critical because this is what convinces people to
[00:32:04.018 --> 00:32:11.459]   accept to legitimize total biometric surveillance We want to stop this epidemic.
[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:17.584]  We need not just to monitor people, we need to monitor what's happening under their skin.
[00:32:19.349 --> 00:32:27.480]  What we've seen so far is corporations and governments collecting data about where we go, who we meet, what movies we watch.
[00:32:28.261 --> 00:32:32.727]  The next phase is the surveillance going under our skin.
[00:32:34.073 --> 00:32:41.140]  We're now seeing mass surveillance systems established even in democratic countries, which previously rejected them.
[00:32:41.801 --> 00:32:45.505]  And we also see a change in the nature of surveillance.
[00:32:46.186 --> 00:32:49.729]  Previously, surveillance was mainly above the skin.
[00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:52.152]  Now it's going under the skin.
[00:32:53.388 --> 00:32:59.311]  Embedded in his hand is a microchip that serves as his keys, his ID, and his wallet.
[00:32:59.491 --> 00:33:03.353]  Governments want to know not just where we go or who we meet.
[00:33:03.693 --> 00:33:07.174]  Above all, they want to know what is happening under our skin.
[00:33:07.775 --> 00:33:08.995]  What's our body temperature?
[00:33:09.355 --> 00:33:10.716]  What's our blood pressure?
[00:33:10.756 --> 00:33:11.837]  What is our medical condition?
[00:33:12.117 --> 00:33:14.698]  In a matter of seconds, the chip is inserted.
[00:33:15.218 --> 00:33:16.799]  Transformation is complete.
[00:33:17.099 --> 00:33:23.362]  When scanned, all of a person's information about their vaccination status is shown on a reader or phone.
[00:33:23.843 --> 00:33:29.466]  Now humans are developing even bigger powers than ever before.
[00:33:29.806 --> 00:33:34.688]  We are really acquiring divine powers of creation and destruction.
[00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:39.591]  We are really upgrading humans into gods.
[00:33:39.691 --> 00:33:43.049]   We are requiring, for instance, the power to re-engineer life.
[00:33:43.049 --> 00:33:53.770]  Humans are now hackable animals.
[00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:55.772]  You will own nothing.
[00:33:56.813 --> 00:33:59.195]  And you will be happy.
[00:34:01.777 --> 00:34:05.641]  I think that fake news have been with us for thousands of years.
[00:34:06.262 --> 00:34:07.183]  Just think of the Bible.
[00:34:08.266 --> 00:34:17.495]  You know, the whole idea that humans have, you know, they have this soul or spirit and they have free will and nobody knows what's happening inside me.
[00:34:17.956 --> 00:34:23.561]  So whatever I choose, whether in the election or whether in the supermarket, this is my free will.
[00:34:23.521 --> 00:34:24.481]  That's all.
[00:34:24.481 --> 00:34:26.481]  [Explosion]
[00:34:26.481 --> 00:34:42.560]  To me, this is the central issue of it all.
[00:34:42.625 --> 00:34:49.687]  When you were on Tucker, you explained, you said, listen, there's not words to describe, I'm paraphrasing, how dark this is.
[00:34:50.487 --> 00:34:55.909]  The open borders, the devaluation of currencies, the destabilization.
[00:34:56.529 --> 00:35:01.031]  When you look at it, there is organization by the administrators, as you said.
[00:35:02.307 --> 00:35:09.275]  It's easy to dynamite and destroy things when you're the administrator and have all this BlackRock money, but notice they can't ever actually build anything.
[00:35:09.576 --> 00:35:18.406]  So they're sitting there going, look what a great artist I am, smashing things, and then society looks like a Jackson Pollock, but how are they ever going to paint a Rembrandt?
[00:35:19.643 --> 00:35:20.104]  They're not.
[00:35:21.787 --> 00:35:26.173]  What they have recognized is that they have no use for us.
[00:35:26.794 --> 00:35:35.207]  And I wish that was an exaggeration, but you can see this so clearly in what they did to the public over COVID.
[00:35:36.055 --> 00:35:48.339]  They were unconcerned about delivering novel, they're not vaccines, but novel so-called vaccines into people who stood no chance for benefiting from them.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:54.742]  Healthy young people, there was never an argument that made any sense for delivering those shots to healthy young people.
[00:35:54.822 --> 00:36:02.739]   About the best you could say was that you might do that in order to protect vulnerable, infirm people?
[00:36:02.739 --> 00:36:07.539]   That's not something a rational civilization would do, but at least that's a logical argument.
[00:36:07.539 --> 00:36:12.498]   But at the point that we discovered that these things did not in any way control the disease,
[00:36:12.498 --> 00:36:16.499]   they didn't control people contracting it, they didn't control people transmitting it,
[00:36:16.499 --> 00:36:23.938]   the logic for inflicting them on healthy young people who were not threatened by COVID and
[00:36:23.938 --> 00:36:26.019]  stood to gain nothing evaporated.
[00:36:26.193 --> 00:36:27.654]  And yet we're doing it to this day.
[00:36:28.374 --> 00:36:36.378]  Harvard apparently just re-initiated their policy of requiring those shots for their own students.
[00:36:36.539 --> 00:36:50.789]   So what that's telling you is that Whatever is driving doesn't care that it is going to kill people who have long potentially important contribute long lives of potentially important contributions to make.
[00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:59.904]   That's that's powerfully said and Well, I've got a hundred angles I want to go with, but Dr., where should we go next?
[00:37:00.244 --> 00:37:02.967]  People can find all your work at darkhorse.locals.com.
[00:37:03.267 --> 00:37:05.810]  They can also find you at Dark Horse on Rumble.
[00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:13.677]  They can find your book, which was amazing right years ago, The Hunter-Gatherer's Guide to the 21st Century from a former professor at Evergreen State College.
[00:37:14.781 --> 00:37:15.602]  Where should we go next?
[00:37:15.622 --> 00:37:17.583]  Because, I mean, I'm happy to direct this.
[00:37:17.603 --> 00:37:22.466]  You want to get into Tucker and Russia and the war, the borders, what's going to happen with the election, Biden?
[00:37:22.486 --> 00:37:24.207]  I mean, you can see it everywhere.
[00:37:24.267 --> 00:37:25.228]  Things are unraveling.
[00:37:25.568 --> 00:37:31.672]  Well, let's briefly just talk about the central concept of the book that Heather and I wrote.
[00:37:31.892 --> 00:37:32.132]  Yes.
[00:37:32.792 --> 00:37:39.817]  The central concept of that book, and in fact, it would also have been a good title, is Hyper-Novelty.
[00:37:40.583 --> 00:37:57.639]  And the idea of hyper-novelty is that although human beings are the fastest evolving animal species that has ever existed, and that is largely the result of the fact that we evolve in a different way, we are actually able to evolve culturally, which is much more rapid than genetic evolution.
[00:37:57.659 --> 00:38:08.346]   But even though we are the fastest evolving animal species that has existed, The rate of technological change is so fast that even our evolutionary capacity... We can't catch up.
[00:38:08.566 --> 00:38:09.366]  We cannot keep up.
[00:38:09.426 --> 00:38:15.328]  And that is resulting in us being sick, physically, psychologically, socially.
[00:38:16.008 --> 00:38:30.092]  And what you're detecting as the collapse of civilization is really a manifestation of many different kinds of hyper-novelty that is making it difficult for us to see what's in our interest, to figure out what to put in our mouths.
[00:38:30.912 --> 00:38:33.214]  To figure out what we should think about various issues.
[00:38:33.615 --> 00:38:45.152]   We are we are like a fish out of water That that's the analogy I use or also even our best men and women trying to go to Mars They're going to lose a lot of their muscle mass, heart mass.
[00:38:45.212 --> 00:38:46.693]  They're going to have serious health problems.
[00:38:47.374 --> 00:38:51.858]  Once they get there, they're going to be very lucky that it has a lower gravity because they're going to be a lot weaker.
[00:38:52.939 --> 00:38:55.862]  And so what we're all going through is such a change.
[00:38:55.882 --> 00:39:00.906]  Whether people believe in classical evolution or not, it's clear humans are evolving.
[00:39:01.206 --> 00:39:02.568]  We do control our environment.
[00:39:04.531 --> 00:39:08.334]  Any other animal out there, we're able to do amazing things.
[00:39:08.774 --> 00:39:11.697]  But with something this accelerated, we can't do it.
[00:39:11.737 --> 00:39:13.078]  But I read a lot of globalist writings.
[00:39:13.418 --> 00:39:14.559]  They're very nihilistic.
[00:39:14.599 --> 00:39:16.100]  They sit back and say, screw it.
[00:39:17.001 --> 00:39:19.443]  It won't matter if billions die on this evolution.
[00:39:20.024 --> 00:39:23.006]  Some humans will accelerate evolution.
[00:39:23.046 --> 00:39:27.429]  We'll get the uber mention out of this battle of the gods, good or dama wrong.
[00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:29.791]  And I'm like, boy, I heard this from Hitler before.
[00:39:30.152 --> 00:39:32.814]  I mean, this is real megalomaniac crap.
[00:39:33.499 --> 00:39:41.404]  Yes, and in fact I heard you recently talking about the fact that there are more than 400 civilian nuclear reactors on planet Earth.
[00:39:42.344 --> 00:39:49.128]  What people may or may not realize is that those reactors require constant vigilance to keep them from melting down.
[00:39:49.449 --> 00:39:53.711]  Their design requires that heat be removed from them constantly.
[00:39:54.011 --> 00:40:01.356]  And so a civilizational breakdown threatens to take all of the material in these reactors and expel it into the world.
[00:40:02.196 --> 00:40:18.183]  Somehow, I don't think the people who are recklessly steering us into such danger have considered the fact that they are living on a planet that is rigged so that they need people to maintain the integrity of those reactors, even for them to have a planet worth living on.
[00:40:19.543 --> 00:40:24.830]  It looks purely reckless to me, and I don't think that there is a super clever secret plan that we are not in on.
[00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:28.876]  I think they think there is, but I think they're wrong that it actually makes sense.
[00:40:29.096 --> 00:40:29.857]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[00:40:29.877 --> 00:40:32.861]  I mean, I know folks that have gone to Davos and been around behind the scenes.
[00:40:32.881 --> 00:40:33.442]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:40:33.502 --> 00:40:35.244]  It's literally prostitutes, drugs.
[00:40:35.685 --> 00:40:36.666]  They're delusional.
[00:40:37.307 --> 00:40:44.017]  They think they're all powerful, they believe this, and they have no plan, even 30 years from now, to have robots running these reactors.
[00:40:44.477 --> 00:40:54.909]   And it's crazy, if you look at the designs of these General Electric systems and others, they'll use outside power to then run the cooling and dump it into a cooling pond
[00:40:54.909 --> 00:40:59.669]   instead of the reactor's own power to run the system to use it in the cooling pond.
[00:40:59.669 --> 00:41:02.710]   And I'm not a nuclear physicist or any of this, but I read what they say.
[00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:06.110]   They're literally built the cheapest and the worst you could
[00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:09.029]   and the minute the power goes off and the minute there's a crisis,
[00:41:09.029 --> 00:41:14.989]   folks, nuclear reactors are not like a 100 megaton bomb going off over Dallas or Austin
[00:41:14.989 --> 00:41:19.669]   and there's a flash at 5,000 feet and it vaporizes and destroys most of the city.
[00:41:19.669 --> 00:41:21.950]  But there's very little radiation after that.
[00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:30.030]   When a reactor goes off like Chernobyl or like Fukushima, it's much worse and those were partially contained.
[00:41:30.359 --> 00:41:43.490]  We're talking about hundreds and hundreds of reactors blowing up, and even if you are half a mile underground, it's going to end up getting to you, and the surface of the Earth will be unlivable for eons.
[00:41:44.511 --> 00:41:52.778]  As you said, I've looked at every angle, there's no way the so-called globalists that pretend they're masters of the universe have even looked at this one problem.
[00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:53.670]  Right.
[00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:57.632]  This one problem already tells you that these are effectively madmen.
[00:41:57.932 --> 00:42:16.481]  Because if they weren't, they would at the very least have arranged to put all of the material that had been out of the reactors long enough, and I believe it's five years, into dry cask storage so that it did not have to be actively cooled in order to... Instead they store it in the open tanks!
[00:42:16.802 --> 00:42:18.482]  The worst possible place you could put it.
[00:42:19.043 --> 00:42:25.096]   And, you know, Fukushima taught us every if you knew how to pay attention to the Fukushima
[00:42:25.096 --> 00:42:27.576]   story, it should have taught us everything we needed to know
[00:42:27.576 --> 00:42:31.346]   because in fact, as bad as Fukushima was, and it's far worse in my opinion
[00:42:31.346 --> 00:42:36.737]   than most people realize, it was a fraction of as bad as it might have been.
[00:42:36.737 --> 00:42:40.456]   And the thing that separated what happened from what might've happened was luck,
[00:42:40.456 --> 00:42:41.336]  right?
[00:42:41.336 --> 00:42:46.177]   They just barely managed to keep it together and it is not hard to imagine
[00:42:46.177 --> 00:42:52.346]   scenarios in which, for example, a fuel pool had cracked and drained causing a fire that
[00:42:52.346 --> 00:42:54.297]   would have made the site unmanageable.
[00:42:54.297 --> 00:43:07.732]   So they are gambling with a A planet that isn't theirs to destroy, that is actually, it is the birthright of every living person and it is the entitlement of all the people who will eventually live here.
[00:43:07.752 --> 00:43:11.016]  They're gambling with it and they obviously don't know what they're doing.
[00:43:11.276 --> 00:43:13.199]  Everybody knows I'm not f***ing around.
[00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:15.002]  I'm taking on the New World Order.
[00:43:15.542 --> 00:43:18.225]  And by the way, I'm not the huge environmentalist in that I follow that cult.
[00:43:18.245 --> 00:43:20.828]  I actually care about the Earth as a conservationist.
[00:43:20.908 --> 00:43:22.509]  It's also all the other creatures on this planet.
[00:43:22.549 --> 00:43:22.690]  Yep.
[00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:40.910]   mother load. Get it now, foundational energy at infowarestore.com or go f*ck yourself.
[00:43:40.948 --> 00:43:41.849]  That's the most evil thing.
[00:43:41.889 --> 00:43:45.312]  I'm like, you won't even get control of the nuclear reactors, assholes.
[00:43:45.852 --> 00:43:46.513]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:43:46.553 --> 00:43:47.273]  It makes me mad.
[00:43:48.194 --> 00:43:58.203]  Well, I must tell you, this is one of the things I like about you best is that you're looking at this logically speaking, not ideologically.
[00:43:58.322 --> 00:44:04.161]   And I find, in fact, many conservatives are not aware of the hazard of the nuclear reactors,
[00:44:04.161 --> 00:44:10.841]   and they are frankly deaf to environmental concerns because environmental concerns have
[00:44:10.841 --> 00:44:15.603]   been abused by those selling climate change as the biggest threat to humanity.
[00:44:15.603 --> 00:44:23.822]   And what I'm hoping will emerge from a partnership across ideology is a recognition that irrespective
[00:44:23.822 --> 00:44:31.261]   of where you think the diversity of the earth came from, that we have an obligation to steward
[00:44:31.261 --> 00:44:34.282]  it well, and we are doing a terrible job of that.
[00:44:34.282 --> 00:44:39.123]   That we have an obligation to, if we're going to have nuclear power, it has to be built
[00:44:39.123 --> 00:44:44.643]   on a different basis than the reactors that we are currently continuing to run, right?
[00:44:44.698 --> 00:44:46.799]  And that this is just common sense.
[00:44:46.859 --> 00:45:03.866]   It's not liberal, it's not conservative, it is common sense, and I don't know Well, I made the point, and I guess you saw part of what I said last week, because it did get picked up and got a lot of views, a couple million views.
[00:45:04.826 --> 00:45:10.906]   I just said, if you sign up with the executive over a nuclear power plant, Well, they made euthanasia legal.
[00:45:11.006 --> 00:45:15.508]  Well, just say then you agree that if it melts down and there's a big problem, you agree to be executed.
[00:45:16.088 --> 00:45:16.909]  No court, no nothing.
[00:45:16.949 --> 00:45:17.689]  You signed on.
[00:45:18.109 --> 00:45:18.770]  You're the steward.
[00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:20.010]  You agreed to run this right.
[00:45:20.891 --> 00:45:22.391]  And the shareholders are sitting out there.
[00:45:22.571 --> 00:45:23.792]  They need to be held responsible.
[00:45:24.012 --> 00:45:25.333]  And I don't want to run around killing people.
[00:45:25.353 --> 00:45:26.493]  I'm not salivating.
[00:45:26.513 --> 00:45:35.218]  I'm just making the point that these people are running things that just a few of these completely melting down will kill hundreds of millions of people of horrible cancers and stuff.
[00:45:35.618 --> 00:45:37.239]  And they should be held accountable.
[00:45:37.947 --> 00:45:50.371]  Well, at the very least, if you want the system to evolve in the direction of producing benefits for humanity, there has to be accountability for people when they make avoidable errors.
[00:45:50.651 --> 00:45:52.852]  Well, how do we have accountability for the nuclear power industry?
[00:45:52.872 --> 00:45:55.333]  Because I get it's a real science, it can be done right.
[00:45:55.353 --> 00:45:57.813]  I've read a lot of books to see what experts have said.
[00:45:58.153 --> 00:46:01.755]  But when I look how they run it, they run it like it's a pig farm or something.
[00:46:01.775 --> 00:46:02.415]  I mean, it's just like...
[00:46:02.975 --> 00:46:05.836]  Just like you said, Fukushima is what I was thinking about.
[00:46:06.677 --> 00:46:11.579]  They've got like all the nuclear waste stored inside the building and inside the water when you're supposed to remove it?
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:17.622]  Yeah, I mean the design was preposterous and you know it was preposterous at many levels.
[00:46:20.082 --> 00:46:32.446]  Below the known level of tsunamis meant that the flooding of the generators that were supposed to keep the cooling water flowing was perfectly predictable, and yet nobody cared about it.
[00:46:32.506 --> 00:46:39.447]  And, you know, as you point out, I don't think anybody who was responsible for that design was held accountable.
[00:46:39.507 --> 00:46:45.829]  In fact, we've obscured the harm that did come from it, and we certainly haven't talked about the harm that might have come from it.
[00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:48.870]  And don't forget the Japanese built it on the worst fault line in the country.
[00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.671]  Absolutely.
[00:46:50.011 --> 00:46:52.634]  This is a completely predictable catastrophe.
[00:46:54.096 --> 00:47:06.170]  So, on a fault line, in a tsunami zone... Right, with reactors, with generators that were unprotected from a flood that would, you know, wasn't a matter of if, it was a matter of when.
[00:47:06.943 --> 00:47:10.665]  Well, I used to talk to a lot of people in Congress, still do, and like military generals and people.
[00:47:11.145 --> 00:47:15.188]  I still do, but they would say, Jones, you don't understand how incompetent the elites are.
[00:47:15.528 --> 00:47:17.249]  You think they've got all the power and control.
[00:47:17.269 --> 00:47:17.549]  They don't.
[00:47:17.569 --> 00:47:19.390]  They've got all the money, so they're in charge.
[00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:23.333]  But they, let me tell you something, they are not paying attention.
[00:47:23.633 --> 00:47:25.214]  And I think that's more frightening.
[00:47:26.328 --> 00:47:30.189]  There's some actual super genius, because at least a super genius wouldn't want to destroy themselves.
[00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.650]  Right.
[00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:43.154]  No, this is my exact concern, is that even the elites, what I call the rent-seeking elites, who we are clearly fighting, even they are depending on us winning, because they don't know enough to run the system.
[00:47:43.174 --> 00:47:45.575]  They don't have the proper caution in their model.
[00:47:45.875 --> 00:47:48.076]  They don't understand the systems that they're playing with.
[00:47:48.156 --> 00:47:54.659]  Frankly, they can't distinguish between a complicated system and a complex system, and they keep upending themselves.
[00:47:54.699 --> 00:47:55.019]  Explain that.
[00:47:55.519 --> 00:48:16.186]  So, a complex system is impossible to predict at a high level of precision, which means that it requires a whole different level of caution than something that is just simply complicated, like a computer, where it may be beyond your ability to understand what's going on in there, but it is all understandable, right?
[00:48:16.226 --> 00:48:20.207]  You can say what a computer is going to do when you alter this, that, or the other thing.
[00:48:20.527 --> 00:48:23.008]  A complex system is a special entity.
[00:48:23.628 --> 00:48:32.537]  And, you know, in the case of COVID, you had multiple nested complex systems, right?
[00:48:32.657 --> 00:48:42.467]  You had a disease interacting with the immune system, which is a complex system, inside a human body, which is a complex system, inside of civilization, which is a complex system.
[00:48:42.828 --> 00:48:43.849]  No wonder they screwed it up.
[00:48:44.369 --> 00:49:06.720]  They just simply didn't know enough about that system to manage it and of course it got out of control and frankly those of us who did appreciate the complexity of the system were able to reveal their foolishness publicly just simply by treating the systems in question with the proper level of analytical respect.
[00:49:07.316 --> 00:49:10.759]  And I get up front because you didn't know exactly what was going on at the time.
[00:49:10.799 --> 00:49:11.560]  You wanted more data.
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:15.763]  You were going along with it at first, but then once you saw what was happening, you changed course.
[00:49:15.803 --> 00:49:20.628]  That takes more courage than people that are partly wrong and they never admit they're wrong.
[00:49:21.168 --> 00:49:25.991]   But if we pull back from this, How did they think cooking this up in a lab?
[00:49:26.531 --> 00:49:30.592]  How did they think when all the scientists scanned it and said, yeah, it's obviously man-made?
[00:49:31.252 --> 00:49:36.354]  And then they bring out a shot, which even their own internal people go public saying, this isn't going to work.
[00:49:36.734 --> 00:49:41.716]  Even the FDA had a memo out in October 2000 saying, we think it'll have all these problems.
[00:49:42.336 --> 00:49:45.717]  And then the big money people just said, we don't care, bring it out there, do it.
[00:49:46.037 --> 00:49:48.938]  And now I watch the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation events.
[00:49:49.378 --> 00:49:50.559]  I watch the congressional hearings.
[00:49:50.619 --> 00:49:51.419]  I watch the hearings.
[00:49:52.842 --> 00:49:56.745]  With all the other big think tanks, like the Clinton Global Initiative.
[00:49:57.305 --> 00:50:01.929]  And there's Chelsea Clinton going, it's true, everyone hates us now and doesn't believe us.
[00:50:02.009 --> 00:50:03.610]  And now no one's taking any of the shots.
[00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:06.172]  It's like 3% uptake on the new boosters.
[00:50:07.033 --> 00:50:19.002]  And like, I was telling him, I'm like, whether they did it on purpose or not, regardless, it shows that they didn't know that this would absolutely screw the pooch.
[00:50:19.562 --> 00:50:20.823]  I mean, because they are hated now.
[00:50:22.742 --> 00:50:24.443]  Well, and rightly so.
[00:50:24.763 --> 00:50:34.728]  You know, it would be one thing if they had made all of these errors, and then upon the revelation that these things were wrong, had changed course.
[00:50:35.348 --> 00:50:40.051]  But the fact that they don't change course tells us they didn't care in the first place whether what they were saying was true.
[00:50:40.071 --> 00:50:42.512]  Maybe they didn't believe any of it to begin with.
[00:50:42.912 --> 00:50:50.016]  So whether they did it on purpose or not, which you can debate all day, they certainly now know and have bought into keeping it going, so now they are behind it.
[00:50:50.836 --> 00:50:51.056]  Right.
[00:50:51.337 --> 00:50:56.465]  I mean, the fact is, those shots should never have been injected into a human being.
[00:50:57.266 --> 00:51:02.935]  It was absolutely clear that we didn't know what their long-term consequences were going to be.
[00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:13.556]  The evidence that they had benefits was misrepresented so that people would accept them with, you know, simple accounting tricks and the like.
[00:51:14.657 --> 00:51:20.281]  But yes, the fact that they are still inflicting new shots tells us that they didn't care about the public in the first place.
[00:51:20.801 --> 00:51:22.402]  And we ought to take that lesson to heart.
[00:51:23.063 --> 00:51:25.985]  Now, to your point about having bought it at first.
[00:51:26.857 --> 00:51:34.441]  There is no question that I, along with most other people, bought something about this story at the beginning.
[00:51:34.561 --> 00:51:37.943]  And to the extent that people have woken up, that's something that happens over time.
[00:51:38.621 --> 00:51:45.384]  But I know very well how my process of awakening began.
[00:51:45.884 --> 00:51:50.206]  It literally took one hour, almost to the minute.
[00:51:50.586 --> 00:51:51.586]  Hello Americans!
[00:51:52.347 --> 00:51:53.947]  I want to share with you a story.
[00:51:54.607 --> 00:52:00.850]  A story about inflammation, the silent menace that lurks within our bodies, affecting our health and well-being.
[00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:07.713]  Inflammation, the root cause of countless ailments, quietly wreaking havoc over time.
[00:52:08.795 --> 00:52:12.678]  Long-term exposure to inflammation has been linked to a myriad of health issues.
[00:52:13.318 --> 00:52:16.461]  From heart disease to arthritis, even cognitive decline.
[00:52:17.501 --> 00:52:21.464]  But fear not, for there's a beacon of hope found in the wisdom of nature.
[00:52:22.185 --> 00:52:25.107]  A remedy that has stood the test of time, turmeric.
[00:52:26.208 --> 00:52:32.973]  Recent studies have uncovered the extraordinary health benefits of curcuminoids, the active compounds in turmeric.
[00:52:33.982 --> 00:52:47.306]  And now I present to you Baudis from InfoWarStore.com, a powerful blend crafted with precision, boasting 95% curcuminoids extracted from turmeric.
[00:52:48.206 --> 00:52:49.367]  But it doesn't stop there.
[00:52:50.007 --> 00:52:59.210]  Baudis incorporates a symphony of ingredients meticulously chosen to enhance the absorption of curcuminoids, ensuring your body reaps the full benefit.
[00:53:00.211 --> 00:53:05.694]  First on the stage, organic black pepper extract, nature's enhancer.
[00:53:06.715 --> 00:53:11.918]  It contains piperine, which studies suggest can boost curcumin absorption by up to 2,000%.
[00:53:13.839 --> 00:53:19.043]  A remarkable duo, working hand-in-hand to maximize the benefits of turmeric.
[00:53:19.963 --> 00:53:25.647]  The final crescendo, body's core, 95% curcuminoids extracted from turmeric.
[00:53:26.747 --> 00:53:34.430]   Once absorbed, Curcuminoids unleash their anti-inflammatory magic, targeting the very pathways that fuel chronic inflammation.
[00:53:35.231 --> 00:53:36.391]  It's not just a supplement.
[00:53:37.032 --> 00:53:40.234]  It's a natural force working with your body to restore balance.
[00:53:41.255 --> 00:53:43.756]  You see, it's not just about what you take.
[00:53:44.256 --> 00:53:46.258]  It's about what your body can absorb.
[00:53:47.409 --> 00:53:50.230]  Now let me throw it over to a man who needs no introduction.
[00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:51.570]  Alex Jones.
[00:53:52.070 --> 00:53:54.871]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula is back in stock.
[00:53:54.891 --> 00:53:55.491]  I want to explain something.
[00:53:55.671 --> 00:53:57.391]  It's turmeric concentrate.
[00:53:57.692 --> 00:53:59.552]  It's 95% curcuminoid.
[00:53:59.832 --> 00:54:02.653]  We went to the top lab and said, what's the strongest you put out?
[00:54:02.673 --> 00:54:03.733]  They said like 87%.
[00:54:04.653 --> 00:54:06.654]  Most companies put out raw turmeric.
[00:54:06.894 --> 00:54:07.114]  It's 5%, 4%.
[00:54:07.714 --> 00:54:10.375]  This is 95% curcuminoid.
[00:54:10.955 --> 00:54:11.255]  Okay?
[00:54:11.495 --> 00:54:20.634]   So this is like, I guess the example's like, instead of eating, you have to eat like, You have 10 of those other pills just to get what is in one of these.
[00:54:21.395 --> 00:54:23.336]  It's good for your heart, your brain, everything.
[00:54:23.476 --> 00:54:26.318]  It is 40% off, back in stock.

[00:54:32.202 --> 00:54:35.944]  BODY'S, an ally in the battle against inflammation.
[00:54:37.350 --> 00:54:42.232]  Visit Infowarsstore.com now and seize the opportunity to take control of your health.
[00:54:42.812 --> 00:54:44.393]  Now you know the rest of the story.
[00:54:45.013 --> 00:54:47.314]  Until next time, good day!
[00:54:47.134 --> 00:54:51.213]  Good day, good day, good day, good day, good day, good day.
[00:54:51.213 --> 00:54:58.052]   And what happened to me was Heather and I were actually working on our book in a remote
[00:54:58.052 --> 00:55:00.293]  location in the Amazon, in Ecuador.
[00:55:00.293 --> 00:55:01.293]  and...
[00:55:01.445 --> 00:55:07.108]  And so we weren't connected to the world because our phones didn't reach anywhere.
[00:55:07.448 --> 00:55:11.594]   And when we emerged from The Amazon, and our phones came awake.
[00:55:12.315 --> 00:55:20.079]  We saw for the first time that there was some novel coronavirus circulating, that the claim was that it was from bats.
[00:55:21.059 --> 00:55:22.860]  And you're a bat scientist?
[00:55:23.001 --> 00:55:25.942]  I'm a bat biologist, so I looked at it and I thought... You're Batman!
[00:55:26.503 --> 00:55:26.883]  I guess.
[00:55:27.663 --> 00:55:47.817]   But I looked at this and I looked at the paper in question, and I thought it would be good, it would be reassuring to tell my Twitter followers that I'd looked at this, that I knew the bat family in question, That it made sense to me that this virus would have emerged in a contact between people and these bats, etc.
[00:55:49.138 --> 00:55:50.099]  And so I put out a tweet.
[00:55:51.027 --> 00:56:02.261]  And one of my followers came back and said, are you saying it's a coincidence that this virus emerged on the doorstep of a biosafety level 4 research lab studying bat coronaviruses in Wuhan?
[00:56:02.301 --> 00:56:03.843]  And I said, what the hell don't I know?
[00:56:04.484 --> 00:56:07.488]  That's shocking, that level of coincidence.
[00:56:07.528 --> 00:56:08.609]  And I retracted my tweet.
[00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:11.952]  And the point is, that's where my awakening started.
[00:56:12.272 --> 00:56:28.102]  Now, I did believe that masks had a potential value, and in fact, that's not such a crazy belief, because we didn't know at first whether this virus transmitted by what's called fomite transmission on surfaces, and if it did, then not coughing droplets onto surfaces would have been useful.
[00:56:28.522 --> 00:56:29.903]  Turns out it doesn't transmit that way.
[00:56:30.303 --> 00:56:35.106]  Turns out the evidence is that masks don't play an important role, and so I got that wrong.
[00:56:35.126 --> 00:56:39.169]   Well, let's make this clear, because people attacking with us Because they're jealous.
[00:56:39.329 --> 00:56:40.130]  You're really smart.
[00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:40.890]  You're entertaining.
[00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:41.631]  You're informative.
[00:56:42.071 --> 00:56:42.892]  I like your show.
[00:56:42.952 --> 00:56:44.213]  Everybody I know likes your show.
[00:56:44.233 --> 00:56:45.914]  I told family you were coming on.
[00:56:45.934 --> 00:56:46.875]  They were really excited about it.
[00:56:47.315 --> 00:56:47.996]  You're popular.
[00:56:48.176 --> 00:56:48.697]  People love you.
[00:56:49.257 --> 00:56:50.558]  And you're a good guy and you're smart.
[00:56:50.958 --> 00:57:01.247]  The fact that you got some things wrong early on out of trying to be cautious and then reversed yourself and become a prominent person fighting it gives you more credibility, not less.
[00:57:01.727 --> 00:57:13.581]  Well, frankly, if I'm looking to figure out who I should be paying attention to, the ability for somebody to improve their model as evidence emerges is the key question.
[00:57:13.641 --> 00:57:14.221]  That's science!
[00:57:14.562 --> 00:57:15.603]  That's how it's done.
[00:57:15.903 --> 00:57:22.651]   And so, yeah, I would love not to have gotten anything wrong, but that's, I think, Inconceivable.
[00:57:22.871 --> 00:57:25.213]  I assumed that something we were being told was true.
[00:57:25.413 --> 00:57:32.519]  I now think, at least at the level of the advice we were given, that essentially you wanted to do exactly the opposite of what you were told to do.
[00:57:32.599 --> 00:57:34.120]  That would have been the best possible thing.
[00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:35.521]  They told you to go home.
[00:57:35.802 --> 00:57:36.242]  Don't go home.
[00:57:36.362 --> 00:57:36.982]  Go outside.
[00:57:37.303 --> 00:57:39.925]  Make vitamin D. But see, you're in the Amazon writing a book.
[00:57:40.245 --> 00:57:42.647]  I'm reading Rockefeller Foundation documents.
[00:57:43.748 --> 00:57:45.049]  I'm interviewing the guy that wrote the U.S.
[00:57:45.089 --> 00:57:46.110]  Biological Weapons Law.
[00:57:46.450 --> 00:57:48.432]  So that's why we were just like, do the opposite.
[00:57:49.335 --> 00:57:49.876]  Do the opposite.
[00:57:49.896 --> 00:57:51.117]  Well, actually, you know, it's funny.
[00:57:51.217 --> 00:58:00.086]   I'm reading Robert Kennedy Jr.' 's new book on bioweapons and the connection to Wuhan.
[00:58:00.886 --> 00:58:09.515]  And it is absolutely frightening history that most of us do not know about our own biological weapons program.
[00:58:09.815 --> 00:58:11.437]  And if you had known... Talk some about that!
[00:58:11.957 --> 00:58:19.399]  Well, I'm learning from Bobby Kennedy, so I would recommend people read this book, just like his last one, The Real Anthony Fauci.
[00:58:20.359 --> 00:58:23.339]  I read the last one, incredible.
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:38.763]  Frankly, it's a book that throws everybody who reads it, and I think through Bobby, when he wrote it, that even just compiling the evidence of what was going on with Anthony Fauci is shocking, almost no matter how awake you are.
[00:58:38.823 --> 00:58:39.723]  It's staggering.
[00:58:39.983 --> 00:58:40.864]  Yeah, it's staggering.
[00:58:40.904 --> 00:58:48.448]  And so the same thing I would say is true with his new book about bioweapons and Wuhan.
[00:58:48.509 --> 00:58:54.192]  But I just highly recommend people look at it and they come to understand, for example... Then you learn they're all over the place.
[00:58:54.632 --> 00:58:55.793]  You learn they're all over the place.
[00:58:55.813 --> 00:59:05.539]  You learn that there is a direct connection from the Japanese bioweapons program during World War II.
[00:59:06.807 --> 00:59:09.531]  And the program that was then built in the U.S.
[00:59:09.651 --> 00:59:11.973]  It's really a strange story.
[00:59:12.374 --> 00:59:32.079]   And then the maybe the most important aspect is that what we see as a pharmaceutical industry and a campaign to generate vaccines that control disease has a very close relationship Just in terms of the people involved has a very close relationship with that bioweapons program.
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:36.886]  That is something every citizen needs to be aware of, that these two things are not distinct.
[00:59:37.665 --> 00:59:39.025]  I remember reading about it.
[00:59:39.225 --> 00:59:40.126]  It's very well documented.
[00:59:40.146 --> 00:59:52.449]  At the end of World War II, they led a bunch of the Japanese war criminals that did the baton death marches and all the biological testing on British, Australian, Canadians, because a lot of them were over there, and U.S.
[00:59:52.509 --> 00:59:53.390]  sailors and people.
[00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:57.271]  But it was mainly British Empire troops.
[00:59:58.131 --> 01:00:00.312]  And they led most of them off.
[01:00:00.492 --> 01:00:01.552]  I guess they hung a few of them.
[01:00:02.092 --> 01:00:04.133]  And they brought them over here, just like the Nazis.
[01:00:05.033 --> 01:00:06.174]  And got all the technology.
[01:00:06.494 --> 01:00:06.714]  Right.
[01:00:06.814 --> 01:00:22.342]  And if you think that the Nazis were the height of diabolical in terms of their medical experiments, the Japanese were involved in literally infecting people or having people infect other people and then dissecting them live without anesthetic.
[01:00:22.382 --> 01:00:28.963]   I mean, this is this is atrocity at a level that stretches the capacity of the mind.
[01:00:28.963 --> 01:00:33.043]   Well, the Japanese are really cool people, very interesting, but if you go back to Japanese
[01:00:33.043 --> 01:00:36.443]   imperial brainwashing and how they worked, if you were rude to your boss,
[01:00:36.443 --> 01:00:38.583]  you would, he'd say, "Kill yourself," and you would.
[01:00:38.583 --> 01:00:41.943]   Their thing was, these troops surrendered, even though they were all shot up and stuff.
[01:00:41.943 --> 01:00:44.123]  You're not a human anymore, you surrendered.
[01:00:44.123 --> 01:00:49.344]   That's why they were flying their planes into our aircraft carriers and committing suicide
[01:00:49.344 --> 01:00:52.724]   before they'd give up or when they were wounded, because that's like, to them, like,
[01:00:52.724 --> 01:00:56.044]   oh, you surrendered, even though you got three bullet holes, You're subhuman.
[01:00:56.044 --> 01:00:57.044]  It goes back to that.
[01:00:57.044 --> 01:00:58.044]  Well, that's one lesson.
[01:00:58.661 --> 01:01:08.225]  The other lesson I would take is that this is actually a set of circuits in the human animal that can be triggered.
[01:01:08.585 --> 01:01:42.061]   And when we look at something like the response to COVID of the official governmental apparatus and the International community and we look at the evidence and it suggests that actually these people did not care about the suffering and death of citizens of any country then what prevents us from making the connection is that it seems impossible for anyone to be so callous but the evidence that that kind of callousness exists that we have well documented
[01:01:43.021 --> 01:01:47.485]  Historical evidence that that not only exists, but that it recurs through history.
[01:01:47.565 --> 01:01:49.166]  The question is, is that where we are now?
[01:01:51.227 --> 01:02:09.561]   I want you to expand on that because one of the biggest mistakes of the Canadian military, the US military, and I'm not blaming the average troops, but the higher-ups and the European Union military, as I'm sure you saw it, in about 2021, by the end, they came out during the dancing nurses and all of it, They do.
[01:02:09.601 --> 01:02:12.343]  What I don't know yet is what the purpose of this was.
[01:02:12.182 --> 01:02:17.222]   psychological warfare systems to scare everybody to submission so they do the right thing and
[01:02:17.222 --> 01:02:18.222]  take the shots.
[01:02:18.222 --> 01:02:23.021]   And actually, our militaries ran this, and we know now the Pentagon was involved in developing
[01:02:23.021 --> 01:02:25.382]  the vaccine, and we're so proud of it.
[01:02:25.382 --> 01:02:28.182]  So they admit they were running a sign-off.
[01:02:28.182 --> 01:02:29.182]  They do.
[01:02:29.182 --> 01:02:33.201]  What I don't know yet is what the purpose of this was.
[01:02:33.201 --> 01:02:41.922]   They seemed absolutely dedicated to getting a shot in every arm that, in principle, I
[01:02:41.922 --> 01:02:48.842]   suppose could be driven by greed, but it does not feel like a satisfying explanation.
[01:02:48.885 --> 01:02:57.111]  There was something driving them to want to vaccinate everybody, even children, who stood no chance of getting any benefit from this.
[01:02:57.451 --> 01:02:58.512]  What was that about?
[01:02:58.912 --> 01:03:00.613]  That's the question that keeps me up at night.
[01:03:01.114 --> 01:03:06.178]  Alright, so do this, Doctor, and I'm going to try to, because you're so polite, I'm going to try to give you the floor here.
[01:03:07.176 --> 01:03:12.522]  I saw you do a great job on Tucker, but even more has come out since you were on a month or so ago.
[01:03:12.683 --> 01:03:29.962]   You break down and do a great job explaining that We're talking about 17 million dead, not from the COVID virus, but from the so-called shots, and then now more information's coming out, and there's an active cover-up going on.
[01:03:30.162 --> 01:03:32.184]  Can you kind of repeat that, but also expand on it?
[01:03:32.544 --> 01:03:32.864]  Sure.
[01:03:32.944 --> 01:03:33.865]  Now, I want to be careful.
[01:03:33.885 --> 01:03:38.087]  People have taken me to task for saying that 17 million people died, which I didn't say.
[01:03:38.107 --> 01:03:40.729]  The statistics show that number's gone up.
[01:03:41.229 --> 01:03:46.834]  Well, Dennis Rancourt did what I think is a credible estimate.
[01:03:46.854 --> 01:03:47.915]  It's well published.
[01:03:47.935 --> 01:03:48.976]  I think you had him on.
[01:03:50.457 --> 01:03:56.483]  And so it suggests that something like this magnitude of death has occurred.
[01:03:56.803 --> 01:03:59.506]  Now, of course, let's say that his estimate is accurate.
[01:04:00.106 --> 01:04:09.054]  That's still a number in the midst of the development of whatever the pathologies will be.
[01:04:09.515 --> 01:04:17.282]  We're still dealing with a wave of excess death that has not ended, so we don't know ultimately what the number would be.
[01:04:18.483 --> 01:04:27.767]  My point would be what we need is an active conversation about how much excess death happened and what were its causes.
[01:04:28.027 --> 01:04:34.510]  Clearly some of it was caused by things like lockdowns which prevented people from getting regular medical care.
[01:04:35.650 --> 01:04:42.253]  But what we need to know is what is the right order of magnitude for that effect?
[01:04:43.253 --> 01:04:44.373]  And what is the nature?
[01:04:46.731 --> 01:04:57.138]  This is, forgive me, this is a little complex, but I want people to think about it carefully, because a lot has been put on the spike protein.
[01:04:58.039 --> 01:05:12.448]  People imagine that the spike protein is the cause of the pathologies, and while I think the spike protein was a very poor choice for these shots, that it does create pathologies of its own, I don't think it's the majority of what's going on.
[01:05:12.669 --> 01:05:27.696]   And in fact, what I believe is It is likely that many of the deaths that occur as a result of these shots, it's the result of the mRNA platform itself.
[01:05:28.496 --> 01:05:36.140]  That anything you loaded onto that platform would produce many of these pathologies, because the platform itself is deeply flawed.
[01:05:37.915 --> 01:06:10.434]   That matters a great deal because one of the things, and I don't know what level in the explanation it serves, but one of the things that is true is that the COVID pandemic, whatever its nature was, from complete PSYOP to entirely biological, allowed the normalization of The mRNA platform being brought and used on the public with minimal testing, which made the flaws in the platform disappear.
[01:06:11.415 --> 01:06:13.357]  It's good for your heart, your brain, everything.

[01:06:32.829 --> 01:06:34.410]  Now you know the rest of the story.
[01:06:35.030 --> 01:06:37.371]  Until next time, good day!
[01:06:41.032 --> 01:06:59.241]   The fact that we were in a hurry to get out of COVID allowed them to normalize the mRNA platform and that that platform, from the business perspective, Allows you to reformulate virtually any vaccine that you wanted and... In a lifetime.
[01:06:59.601 --> 01:06:59.801]  Right.
[01:06:59.961 --> 01:07:08.006]  Presumably to repatent it, to create vaccines very quickly for new pathogens, whatever their origin might be.
[01:07:08.907 --> 01:07:15.330]  And what we in the public need to be aware of is that they haven't figured out how to solve the problem with it.
[01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:19.153]  So anytime they deploy it, we need to say no.
[01:07:20.893 --> 01:07:24.635]  So, let me just describe a little bit about why that flaw exists.
[01:07:26.516 --> 01:07:34.640]  The mRNA message, this is a genetic message loaded into this platform, is surrounded by something called lipid nanoparticle.
[01:07:36.361 --> 01:07:44.125]  If those lipid nanoparticles stayed in your deltoid muscle, then their consequence would be localized.
[01:07:44.205 --> 01:07:48.627]  And although this consequence would be negative in your deltoid, it wouldn't be devastating to your health.
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:53.303]  But they, of course, don't stay in your deltoid, which we learned very early.
[01:07:53.483 --> 01:07:54.885]  They circulate around the body.
[01:07:55.065 --> 01:08:11.799]  And the problem is that that lipid nanoparticle, lipid just means fat, and because like dissolves like, the fat on these tiny particles causes the mRNA to be absorbed into any cell they encounter.
[01:08:12.159 --> 01:08:13.961]  All of your cells are covered in a fat layer.
[01:08:14.281 --> 01:08:17.464]  So wherever these things circulate around the body, they get absorbed.
[01:08:18.407 --> 01:08:24.190]  And when they get absorbed, they trigger the cells that have taken them up to produce this protein.
[01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:26.811]  Now, this is the important part.
[01:08:27.491 --> 01:08:37.256]  Your immune system is built so that it recognizes any cell of yours that is producing a protein that you do not ordinarily make.
[01:08:37.836 --> 01:08:40.017]  And it targets that cell and destroys it.
[01:08:40.137 --> 01:08:40.858]  Like it's cancer?
[01:08:41.558 --> 01:08:43.179]  Like it's virally infected.
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:47.562]  So basically, their mRNA shots are a pseudovirus.
[01:08:47.982 --> 01:08:54.786]  They infect cells, cause those cells to make this protein, and then the immune system treats them like they are virally infected cells and destroys them.
[01:08:55.167 --> 01:08:58.309]  Which, if that happens in your liver, maybe it's not that serious.
[01:08:58.329 --> 01:08:59.009]  You can afford it.
[01:08:59.369 --> 01:09:05.233]   If it happens in your heart, it's potentially devastating, because it creates a wound Which is then a vulnerability.
[01:09:05.653 --> 01:09:16.878]  If you're a soccer player and you're running particularly hard, you know, you can get a blood vessel that bursts in your heart, causing a devastating pathology, causing your death, for example.
[01:09:17.238 --> 01:09:17.398]  Right?
[01:09:17.418 --> 01:09:32.004]  This is a predictable consequence of a shot that has no ability to target which cells take it up, and therefore no ability to protect you from your own immune system destroying the cells that have taken it up and giving you a lethal wound.
[01:09:33.271 --> 01:09:45.282]  We're taping this now, but that gives me the luxury to go back and add these clips in, but there were three or four C-SPAN programs with Fauci and others in 2017, 18, 19, with all the different federal heads up there.
[01:09:45.302 --> 01:09:49.305]  They're like, we're going to use a novel virus out of China, and I'll play the clip.
[01:09:49.903 --> 01:09:54.622]   to blow up the old FDA system and we're just gonna bring in mRNA.
[01:09:54.622 --> 01:09:59.822]   Well, I'm not a scientist, I'm not a doctor, I'm not a biologist like you,
[01:09:59.822 --> 01:10:04.382]   but I sit here every day and I read Scientific American and I read studies and I read it.
[01:10:04.382 --> 01:10:09.663]   I remember, I've been on there 30 years, I remember reading 20 years ago about,
[01:10:09.663 --> 01:10:15.663]   "Hey, mRNA cancer trial or mRNA this." And like one kid was a study in New York died.
[01:10:15.817 --> 01:10:21.401]  And they're like, well, we think it's promising, but it kills so many people, we can't do it.
[01:10:21.461 --> 01:10:26.545]  And so in lay terms, that's the platform itself is so dangerous.
[01:10:26.605 --> 01:10:28.507]  Yeah, maybe you can do something.
[01:10:29.502 --> 01:10:40.742]  But we can't use the whole public as guinea pigs and I just see them trying to pollute the whole system with so much death and illness that now we don't know what hit us and they can then use all of us.
[01:10:42.114 --> 01:10:54.598]  The big corporate system as guinea pigs because they themselves want life extension and they themselves want the cure to cancer, but they're saying we've got to do this and now Tony Blair has got a company and so does Bill Gates.
[01:10:55.078 --> 01:10:58.319]  Oh, they've got a new mRNA vaccine cures cancer.
[01:10:58.919 --> 01:11:00.580]  Oh, didn't know cancer was communicable.
[01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:12.123]   No folks, they've changed the definition of vaccines to where it just means something that we put into your Body that lessens the disease.
[01:11:12.504 --> 01:11:15.044]  But just five years ago, it was totally different.
[01:11:15.064 --> 01:11:21.186]  So I even had my 15-year-old daughter this morning at breakfast, and she's arguing with me about vaccines.
[01:11:21.366 --> 01:11:33.369]  And she's reading stuff online, and she goes to school, and I try to explain things to her, and she says, dad, a vaccine is just something that lessens the disease.
[01:11:33.409 --> 01:11:39.391]   And I said, no, honey, before that, if you've got a real vaccine, it's a real technology, Your body learns how to beat it.
[01:11:39.892 --> 01:11:42.955]  They give you a broken version of it or a weakened version, and you beat it.
[01:11:43.015 --> 01:11:44.056]  Mesa loves side effects.
[01:11:44.636 --> 01:11:49.000]  Sometimes you might have an allergic response, but if they had good, clean stuff, I'd take the risk.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.742]  I'd be taking it all like it was pumpkin pie.
[01:11:51.262 --> 01:11:52.684]  She's like, Dad, how do you know all this?
[01:11:52.804 --> 01:11:54.585]  And I said, well, fine, I got a scientist coming on.
[01:11:54.926 --> 01:11:56.727]  I'm going to make you watch it in a couple of days.
[01:11:57.028 --> 01:11:58.149]  She said, fine, I'll watch it.
[01:11:58.489 --> 01:12:00.711]  So this is the level we're dealing with here.
[01:12:01.452 --> 01:12:02.373]  But am I right in what I said?
[01:12:03.032 --> 01:12:04.433]  Yeah, you're right in what you said.
[01:12:04.473 --> 01:12:18.240]  They changed the definition and they utilized an emergency in order to speed it past the tests that I believe would never have allowed it to be used on humans or frankly even farm animals.
[01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:26.964]  They used the panic that was in the public, panic which they themselves induced in order to sneak it past the controls.
[01:12:27.224 --> 01:12:32.305]   And I do have to wonder how much They saw this coming.
[01:12:32.806 --> 01:12:36.949]  Either they waited for an emergency, or it's possible they created the emergency.
[01:12:36.989 --> 01:12:39.011]  Those are two distinct hypotheses.
[01:12:39.091 --> 01:12:49.541]  But nonetheless, they used the fact that people urgently wanted to have their fear of the virus lessened to sell a lie.
[01:12:49.601 --> 01:13:04.722]   And in fact, this is where, you know, I talked a little bit about how I Woke up at the point that my Twitter follower told me that there was a biosafety level 4 lab studying these viruses in Wuhan.
[01:13:05.162 --> 01:13:17.149]  The place where that process really kicked into high gear was at the point that they said these so-called vaccines were safe.
[01:13:18.888 --> 01:13:23.774]  Heather and I knew for certain that that could not possibly be the case.
[01:13:23.994 --> 01:13:30.462]  And the reason it can't possibly be the case is because safe does not mean without harm.
[01:13:30.663 --> 01:13:32.225]  It means without risk.
[01:13:33.277 --> 01:13:38.701]  If a person gets in their car drunk and drives home and they don't hit anything, it was still not safe.
[01:13:39.201 --> 01:13:40.902]  The fact that they did no harm doesn't mean anything.
[01:13:40.942 --> 01:13:41.663]  It was dangerous.
[01:13:41.983 --> 01:13:49.148]  So when they told us that these so-called vaccines were safe, they had to be lying and they had to know it.
[01:13:49.268 --> 01:13:52.330]  And yet they looked right into the camera and they told us that.
[01:13:52.690 --> 01:13:53.591]  Safe and effective.
[01:13:53.951 --> 01:13:54.672]  Safe and effective.
[01:13:54.712 --> 01:13:58.598]  Effective turned out to be equally nonsensical.
[01:13:59.018 --> 01:14:00.701]  But safe had to be a lie.
[01:14:00.901 --> 01:14:06.829]  And at the point that they were lying over that, then it raised questions of informed consent.
[01:14:07.230 --> 01:14:15.717]   Because, of course, at the end of World War II, the Allied Powers tried Nazi doctors and we literally hung seven doctors.
[01:14:15.777 --> 01:14:24.681]  We killed them because they had violated informed consent of their patients, even though informed consent had not been formally codified yet.
[01:14:25.381 --> 01:14:35.193]   So for public health authorities in 2021, to be telling us that these shots were safe when they knew
[01:14:35.193 --> 01:14:39.783]   better meant they weren't interested in informed consent. They had somehow given up on that
[01:14:39.783 --> 01:14:47.673]   principle and that was effectively a declaration of war on the public. And then you add all the
[01:14:47.673 --> 01:14:51.103]   pressuring and all the intimidation and all the mandates.
[01:14:51.298 --> 01:14:56.080]  Now I notice in Australia, and Germany, and the UK, and Canada, they're like, we never told you you had to.
[01:14:56.100 --> 01:15:00.182]  Well, they fired hundreds of thousands of nurses worldwide, and persecuted people.
[01:15:00.242 --> 01:15:07.685]  No, you guys just, Joseph Minglet, you literally just violated the Nuremberg Code, correct?
[01:15:08.585 --> 01:15:13.587]  Absolutely, and in fact, I was, I had not read the Nuremberg Code.
[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:22.646]  Until I started looking into this question, and there are 10 provisions in it, and not only did they violate the Nuremberg Code twice, right?
[01:15:22.806 --> 01:15:27.369]  It wasn't consent, it was coerced, and it wasn't informed, they lied to us.
[01:15:27.649 --> 01:15:31.292]  But they violated every provision in it, right?
[01:15:31.352 --> 01:15:37.096]  This was, they torched the Nuremberg Code, and we still haven't had that conversation publicly.
[01:15:37.256 --> 01:15:45.761]  And notice how smart, because I read that on air like three years ago, how good those lawyers were back then, because they covered every angle a tyrant would try.
[01:15:45.781 --> 01:15:46.662]  Absolutely.
[01:15:46.722 --> 01:15:48.683]  And you read it, you go, oh my God, that's what they just did.
[01:15:48.703 --> 01:15:49.144]  Yep.
[01:15:49.604 --> 01:15:52.786]  It's like, instead of saying, don't file it, they went, this is how we do it.
[01:15:55.215 --> 01:16:03.685]  It is possible they used it as an instruction set, and that tells you what kind of contempt they must hold us in.
[01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:14.680]   For them to have looked at a pillar of Western civilization, an achievement that was All right, Dr. Bret Weinstein, stay right there.
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:18.522]  I want to come back in the time we have and hit a whole bunch of issues.
[01:16:18.542 --> 01:16:20.703]  Tucker, Russia, the wars, the border, all of it with you.
[01:16:20.723 --> 01:16:20.903]  Amazing.
[01:16:20.923 --> 01:16:21.884]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:21.704 --> 01:16:25.344]  that so willingly really tells us what we're up against.
[01:16:25.344 --> 01:16:27.264]  Alright, Dr. Brett Weinstein, stay right there.
[01:16:27.264 --> 01:16:30.463]   I want to come back in the time we have and hit a whole bunch of issues.
[01:16:30.463 --> 01:16:33.824]  Tucker, Russia, the wars, the border, all of it with you.
[01:16:33.824 --> 01:16:35.904]  Amazing. We'll be right back, folks.
[01:16:35.904 --> 01:16:36.504]  Stay with us.
[01:16:36.504 --> 01:16:43.704]   Two years ago, we began developing this game that came out so much better than we thought it would.
[01:16:43.689 --> 01:16:44.949]  It is now a number one hit.
[01:16:45.410 --> 01:16:48.851]  I imagined the control freak left attacking it.
[01:16:49.372 --> 01:17:02.459]  But I didn't know that right when the game came out, with perfect timing, Elon Musk would release me on X. And the whole world will be waking up and the Davos Group will be confronted at their own events by world leaders calling out their tyranny.
[01:17:02.839 --> 01:17:04.280]  This is the planets aligning.
[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:11.444]  And now, MSNBC, the corporate press, Media Matters, George Soros, they're all calling for it to be banned.
[01:17:11.704 --> 01:17:20.729]  Is there a way to counter the types of hate that people like Alex Jones promote and now they do in video games?
[01:17:20.789 --> 01:17:26.231]  I mean, this is a party that talks about video games being dangerous for our kids.
[01:17:26.492 --> 01:17:30.734]  And yet here he is with a video game that promotes violence.
[01:17:31.314 --> 01:17:32.195]  You will be silenced.
[01:17:33.656 --> 01:17:35.797]  And celebrates that kind of violence.
[01:17:37.018 --> 01:17:39.259]  You suck, big tech lizard nerd!
[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:47.645]  Because, let's be honest here, when he is talking about killing globalists, we know what globalists now means for the Republican Party and what that is code for.
[01:17:47.986 --> 01:17:53.489]  Because they understand they're reaching a bunch of young guys who are getting this sort of message beaten into them right now.
[01:17:53.770 --> 01:17:56.532]  Today, I'm playing the Unhinged Alex Jones video game.
[01:17:56.832 --> 01:18:00.695]  I saw it was released on Steam, so I'm like, well, that kind of opens the floodgates.
[01:18:00.895 --> 01:18:02.376]  This game is actually really good fun.
[01:18:04.890 --> 01:18:07.751]  Look at all the blood!
[01:18:08.472 --> 01:18:11.093]  Look at all these zombies!
[01:18:11.193 --> 01:18:11.773]  Okay.
[01:18:12.594 --> 01:18:14.015]  I'll eat your ass!
[01:18:14.495 --> 01:18:15.695]  Okay, so that is what he said.
[01:18:17.016 --> 01:18:18.056]  I'll eat your ass!
[01:18:18.377 --> 01:18:24.460]  I don't know what the characteristics of the game are beyond that he's involved and that it's killing globalists.
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:32.044]   This is the kind of thing that will become a normalization lever In teaching people, I mean, it's okay to kill.
[01:18:32.304 --> 01:18:34.125]  It's okay to kill the globalists.
[01:18:34.145 --> 01:18:35.186]  This is pretty amazing.
[01:18:37.147 --> 01:18:39.289]  Jump around, jump around.
[01:18:39.349 --> 01:18:42.991]  Alex Jones, you are a hero!
[01:18:43.011 --> 01:18:46.534]  This is supposed to be Justin Trudeau, I think.
[01:18:47.854 --> 01:18:48.675]  Come on, Mark!
[01:18:49.416 --> 01:18:50.456]  Oh, sh**!
[01:18:51.297 --> 01:18:52.878]  Mark Zuckerberg, kill me!
[01:18:53.018 --> 01:18:53.979]  Look at him crawling away!
[01:18:54.539 --> 01:18:54.819]  Wait!
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:56.821]  What them dolls gonna do?
[01:18:56.841 --> 01:18:57.101]  They gonna...
[01:18:58.708 --> 01:18:59.907]  Oh, they ate his ass.
[01:18:59.907 --> 01:19:03.028]  Find out what they're scared of at alexjonesgame.com.
[01:19:03.028 --> 01:19:06.427]   Follow the link from there to Steam and download it and share it.
[01:19:06.427 --> 01:19:11.467]   It's 1776. It funds the Info War. It is key in the Culture War.
[01:19:11.467 --> 01:19:18.427]   We need to be engaged and involved in books and films and universities and Hollywood and everywhere.
[01:19:18.427 --> 01:19:24.628]   And we are. So get Alex Jones' New World Order Wars right now before they ban it.
[01:19:24.628 --> 01:19:29.427]   Make it such a big hit, they continue to s*** their f***ing pants.
[01:19:29.427 --> 01:19:33.827]   And all the control freaks, I want to echo what Elon Musk said to your censorship.
[01:19:33.827 --> 01:19:35.827]  Go f*** yourselves.
[01:19:36.628 --> 01:19:36.378]   Before we go any further in the time, because now I want to run through a whole bunch of topics, get your take on them,
[01:19:36.378 --> 01:19:42.628]  because I really...
[01:19:42.978 --> 01:19:44.138]  I want to hear your view on things.
[01:19:44.618 --> 01:19:50.720]  How do people, not that most folks don't know about or don't listen, find your podcast, find your show, find your book.
[01:19:50.740 --> 01:19:51.720]  We're going to put it on screen.
[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:56.621]  Dark Horse is the name of your podcast, darkhorse.locals.com.
[01:19:56.721 --> 01:19:59.081]  You also have Dark Horse on Rumble.
[01:19:59.301 --> 01:20:03.782]  We're putting that on screen right now, but what else would you like to tell the viewers and listeners about where they can find you?
[01:20:04.402 --> 01:20:08.483]  It'd be great if you would sign up for my Twitter feed.
[01:20:08.763 --> 01:20:10.764]  I'm at Brett Weinstein.
[01:20:11.584 --> 01:20:12.504]  Brett has one T.
[01:20:14.446 --> 01:20:19.448]  And yes, do sign up for our Locals Community and on our Rumble channel.
[01:20:19.488 --> 01:20:20.108]  That helps us.
[01:20:20.188 --> 01:20:22.589]  It's free to you and we really appreciate it.
[01:20:23.229 --> 01:20:33.892]  And I'm glad you raised that because I know your Twitter, I know your ex has been following it for years, but even when I was kicked off Twitter before Elon brought me back, and I still sometimes run onto the fake accounts.
[01:20:35.086 --> 01:20:44.078]  There are fake accounts and there is something algorithmically going on inside of Twitter which is also very strange when you see it from my side of the screen.
[01:20:44.358 --> 01:20:45.260]  I don't know what it is.
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:47.723]  I suspect it's not Elon doing it.
[01:20:50.206 --> 01:20:50.966]  Let's put it this way.
[01:20:51.006 --> 01:20:57.029]  He said that he had in fact purchased a crime scene and I think that is a very apt description.
[01:20:57.069 --> 01:20:59.390]  There's a lot about Twitter that is not straightforward.
[01:20:59.650 --> 01:21:06.133]  When I was able to speak to him for over two and a half hours, like six weeks ago, he said, listen, it was set up to run these shenanigans.
[01:21:06.554 --> 01:21:08.494]  The very fabric of it is a fraud.
[01:21:08.534 --> 01:21:09.475]  We're trying to fix it.
[01:21:09.915 --> 01:21:10.075]  Yeah.
[01:21:10.095 --> 01:21:11.238]  It's like a ghost in the machine.
[01:21:11.599 --> 01:21:17.010]  That's in fact exactly the phrase that I used to try to convey this to him.
[01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:20.016]  There are things that I can see from my side that I think he's unaware of.
[01:21:21.474 --> 01:21:22.935]  So, anyway, I hope he does fix it.
[01:21:23.055 --> 01:21:30.857]  At one point he was talking about having to rebuild it in order to get all of the ghosts out of the machine, and I don't know where he is with that thought process.
[01:21:31.057 --> 01:21:37.558]  Because I have contacts, not as good as yours, but I'm able to call some of his top people when they block us or won't let me put my website up.
[01:21:37.578 --> 01:21:38.439]  He goes, yeah, we'll fix it.
[01:21:38.459 --> 01:21:41.719]  It's fixing an hour, and then somebody turns it back on.
[01:21:42.340 --> 01:21:43.400]  They built a lot of back doors.
[01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:43.880]  Right.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.521]  There's a lot going on in there that is not about the front end of Twitter.
[01:21:48.081 --> 01:21:50.242]  All right, we got 40 minutes left.
[01:21:50.282 --> 01:21:51.002]  Let's run through it all.
[01:21:51.282 --> 01:21:52.682]  You just went to the Darien Gap.
[01:21:53.462 --> 01:21:57.103]  Again, that's where North America ends or Central America ends.
[01:21:57.143 --> 01:21:58.244]  It goes into South America.
[01:21:58.564 --> 01:22:01.785]  They're officially building this giant UN operation.
[01:22:02.325 --> 01:22:06.946]  You did a great summation when you were on Tucker, but can you expand on that for viewers?
[01:22:07.782 --> 01:22:11.463]  Sure, so the Darien Gap is a gap in the Pan-American Highway.
[01:22:11.503 --> 01:22:15.665]  It's about 60 miles in length, where the highway has never been completed.
[01:22:15.705 --> 01:22:20.606]  This is a highway that goes from Prudhoe Bay, Alaska to the southern tip of South America, and there's a jungle.
[01:22:20.746 --> 01:22:39.554]   In fact, there's a national park in the Darien Province of Panama, and what has happened is that For various reasons, largely encouraged by the international community, various NGOs, there is a massive migration of people coming through
[01:22:40.484 --> 01:22:41.324]  The Darien Gap.
[01:22:41.785 --> 01:22:45.106]  And this is a disaster at an environmental level.
[01:22:45.126 --> 01:22:51.488]  This is extremely destructive of this unique forest, and it really is a unique forest.
[01:22:52.369 --> 01:22:55.850]  It is a humanitarian catastrophe as well.
[01:22:56.290 --> 01:23:05.113]  People are dying in the jungle because almost all of them enter it unprepared, and it's an extremely difficult habitat to cross.
[01:23:05.514 --> 01:23:20.618]   And it's also I'm not even sure what the word would be, but politically, the implications of the huge number of migrants, almost all of whom are coming north to the U.S., are going to cross our southern border, the implications are utterly profound.
[01:23:21.438 --> 01:23:51.520]   Now, what I told Tucker was that I wasn't exactly sure why I went to look at this in person, because there's plenty of documentation from Michael Yan, about what's taking place but something told me that I needed to see it in person in order to understand it and that turned out to be true that actually looking at it in person changed what I understood and I came to the conclusion that there is a massive migration but there is also something
[01:23:52.529 --> 01:24:03.558]  My hypothesis is that it's actually an invasion of Chinese migrants who are motivated by something entirely distinct from the people migrating from elsewhere in the world.
[01:24:04.299 --> 01:24:22.599]   The migrants from elsewhere, a lot of them are from South America, some of them are from the Middle East, but those migrants All tell the same story about being motivated by the economic collapses in their home countries and what they perceive as economic opportunity in the US.
[01:24:23.079 --> 01:24:25.680]  The Chinese migrants aren't interested in talking at all.
[01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:27.441]  In fact, they're extremely cagey.
[01:24:28.001 --> 01:24:31.743]  To the extent that one gets anything from them, it is a kind of hostility.
[01:24:32.323 --> 01:24:37.766]  There is a distinct male bias in the population of Chinese migrants.
[01:24:37.806 --> 01:24:51.434]  So we're talking about young military, military-age males, most of them very fit, unwilling to talk about what they're doing, and oddly enough, housed separately in Panama.
[01:24:52.034 --> 01:24:53.815]  We know there's some Chinese government sponsorship.
[01:24:54.859 --> 01:24:59.162]  It certainly looks like the Chinese government would have to be aware of these migrants.
[01:24:59.302 --> 01:25:02.645]  Presumably, it would have had to let them leave China.
[01:25:02.665 --> 01:25:04.246]  And they've got complex apps?
[01:25:04.946 --> 01:25:05.947]  They have, yes.
[01:25:06.007 --> 01:25:09.409]  This is a strange combination of low-tech and high-tech.
[01:25:09.509 --> 01:25:16.014]  There are apps that appear to tell them where to go and how to make the migration.
[01:25:16.995 --> 01:25:26.001]  They're using things like Western Union in order to bring money from home so that they can buy bus tickets that allow them to travel through Central America.
[01:25:26.361 --> 01:25:35.427]  It's a very odd circumstance and the international community has its fingerprints all over it.
[01:25:35.827 --> 01:25:50.595]   You can see American flags, you can see the IOM, that's a UN body that If you read their website, they clearly believe that migration is inherently a good thing and it is their job to bring it about.
[01:25:50.936 --> 01:25:58.959]  So this organization is inviting people to try to cross the Darien Gap, some of whom don't make it.
[01:25:59.279 --> 01:26:04.722]  Mothers are leaving the jungle having lost children, children are leaving the jungle orphaned.
[01:26:05.042 --> 01:26:22.512]   It's a catastrophe and why the international community And no media coverage other than you and Tucker Carlson and Michael Yawn, and you said a humanitarian disaster.
[01:26:23.893 --> 01:26:26.695]  You made a point on Tucker, I forget the exact quote, but it was powerful.
[01:26:26.735 --> 01:26:32.519]  You said, it's almost impossible to overstate how dark and organized this is.
[01:26:33.379 --> 01:26:38.343]  Yes, it's visible on the ground, but nobody goes to look at it.
[01:26:38.503 --> 01:26:43.987]  And I must say, I'm grateful to Michael Jan for having invited me and having given me effectively a guided tour.
[01:26:44.267 --> 01:26:45.889]  He brought, in fact, me and my son.
[01:26:45.909 --> 01:26:47.190]  We traveled.
[01:26:48.174 --> 01:26:52.557]  To Darien, and he knew exactly where to take us so that we could look at it for ourselves.
[01:26:53.137 --> 01:26:58.201]  Maybe it's also you going home, because I think Jon told me you actually, for part of your bat research, lived down there for a while, right?
[01:26:58.661 --> 01:27:06.367]  I lived in the Panama Canal in Lake Gatun on Barrow, Colorado Island for 18 months while I was studying bats.
[01:27:06.427 --> 01:27:28.231]   So I know Panama reasonably well, and what is taking place in In the Darien Gap, and moving north, is in its own way an inversion of what was true in Panama when I was there in the late 90s.
[01:27:28.271 --> 01:27:31.693]  Meaning the US military was still in control?
[01:27:32.366 --> 01:27:35.510]  Well, the handover was in process, but the U.S.
[01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:41.538]  had not officially handed the canal over and its military presence was still there, and these things were well understood.
[01:27:41.558 --> 01:27:55.896]   The canal was an American achievement, the military's presence there Uh, was both symbolic and important to the protection of the canal, which was understood to be vital to the interests of the United States.
[01:27:56.396 --> 01:28:06.804]   And now, in Fort Clayton, which was the Army South headquarters, when I was there, that has now been taken over by the
[01:28:06.804 --> 01:28:12.465]   international community and turned to the purpose of encouraging this migration,
[01:28:12.465 --> 01:28:15.425]  thereby jeopardizing the security of the United States.
[01:28:15.425 --> 01:28:18.425]  So it's a UN globalist invasion port?
[01:28:18.425 --> 01:28:20.425]  You know, it seems to be.
[01:28:20.566 --> 01:28:22.187]  It's very hard for me to imagine.
[01:28:22.207 --> 01:28:36.894]  I don't know what story these people tell themselves about what they are doing, but yes, it appears to be that what was once, what was built to protect American interests and to facilitate our well-being is now being turned to its exact opposite purpose.
[01:28:37.515 --> 01:28:52.265]   Like everything else, I don't see how the powerful financial interests of the world are using American power to continue their corporate empire, but at the same time, schizophrenically, Paradoxically, moronically attacking it.
[01:28:54.246 --> 01:28:54.566]  Yes.
[01:28:54.586 --> 01:29:00.349]  I mean, I think we're always left to struggle for what they could possibly be thinking.
[01:29:00.409 --> 01:29:03.151]  And I think where you began this discussion is exactly right.
[01:29:03.831 --> 01:29:08.867]   We have to take into account that Diabolical, yes.
[01:29:09.247 --> 01:29:10.729]  Geniuses, I don't think so.
[01:29:11.150 --> 01:29:20.262]  I think these people are reckless and they do not understand that they are having a much easier time breaking these systems than they will have rebuilding them.
[01:29:20.642 --> 01:29:22.505]  I think they're looking only first order.
[01:29:22.945 --> 01:29:24.948]  They're not looking second, third, fourth order.
[01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:44.064]  Well, it's almost like they have the mentality that they can, you know, rebuilding the system isn't high on their priority list because they know that they have to break the systems that allow citizens some control over their own well-being and their own future.
[01:29:44.084 --> 01:29:45.145]  That's the crazy gamble.
[01:29:45.185 --> 01:29:46.825]  They think they can wreck it and then rebuild it.
[01:29:47.625 --> 01:29:56.689]   Yes, and in fact it's not unlike What the diversity and equity inclusion diversity equity and inclusion folks are thinking, right?
[01:29:56.769 --> 01:30:05.913]  They are very focused on tearing down a system the evils of which they believe themselves to be thoroughly familiar with.
[01:30:05.933 --> 01:30:07.394]  Even though they're in control of it.
[01:30:07.794 --> 01:30:10.516]  That's the mental illness is they're in control of it.
[01:30:11.716 --> 01:30:18.322]   Like it's kind of like when the Fall of Rome finally happened at 410 with Alaric, and they burned down almost everything.
[01:30:18.342 --> 01:30:20.263]  They were so shocked by one building, they left it alone.
[01:30:20.744 --> 01:30:26.249]  But it never came back, basically, because they just said, well, we'll just burn it, instead of saying, well, we run this now.
[01:30:27.062 --> 01:30:37.887]  Right, and the fact is, Heather frequently points out that this is really a mistake that could only be made by people who have not traveled the world.
[01:30:38.467 --> 01:30:45.710]  Because once you've seen how successful our system actually is, yeah, there's unfairness in it, no question about that.
[01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:54.974]  But you would address the unfairness at the level that it actually exists, rather than imagine that if you tear it apart, that something better will replace it.
[01:30:55.094 --> 01:30:56.354]  Let me use a silly analogy.
[01:30:56.654 --> 01:31:03.356]  Here's American Western success for GDP and human freedom and medicine and mobility and human empowerment.
[01:31:03.436 --> 01:31:03.876]  It's up here.
[01:31:04.196 --> 01:31:07.997]  And then it's got a lot of unfairness to it, so it's got unfairness down here.
[01:31:08.317 --> 01:31:12.678]  The game-changing Nootropic is now back in stock at InfoWarstore.com.
[01:31:12.698 --> 01:31:15.819]  You need to experience Brain Force Ultra for yourself.
[01:31:16.199 --> 01:31:16.780]  It's special.
[01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:18.440]  It's available at InfoWarstore.com.
[01:31:18.985 --> 01:31:25.520]  But the system they're going to create has a ceiling way down here, way worse than even what people live in in the unfairness.
[01:31:26.374 --> 01:31:26.874]  Absolutely.
[01:31:27.194 --> 01:31:37.220]  There's almost no way that they could exceed what Western civilization has already done to bring about fairness, which doesn't mean that it has arrived at fairness.
[01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:39.381]  But we don't blow up the best thing we got.
[01:31:39.681 --> 01:31:39.941]  Right.
[01:31:40.181 --> 01:31:50.867]  It's like you're on a ship at sea and you decide that you don't like something about its construction, so you're going to sink it in hopes that something better comes along.
[01:31:51.427 --> 01:31:52.468]  Instead, you just drown.
[01:31:52.568 --> 01:31:52.748]  Right.
[01:31:52.908 --> 01:31:53.649]  That's what you're gonna do.
[01:31:53.689 --> 01:31:56.210]  You take it into port, you buy the ship, you change it.
[01:31:56.631 --> 01:31:56.791]  Right.
[01:31:57.491 --> 01:31:59.672]  You upgrade the ship, or you trade it for something.
[01:31:59.712 --> 01:32:03.655]  You don't destroy it in the hopes that a better one is gonna arrive, because that's not gonna happen.
[01:32:03.715 --> 01:32:05.896]  You're gonna drown as a result of that folly.
[01:32:06.297 --> 01:32:07.297]  This is an incredible interview.
[01:32:07.317 --> 01:32:09.599]  We've only got 30 minutes left, but you're hitting on all cylinders.
[01:32:10.159 --> 01:32:11.860]  We're all seeing the same reality.
[01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:15.763]  It's not like we're following some script of music or some directive we got.
[01:32:16.503 --> 01:32:17.104]  It's right there.
[01:32:17.987 --> 01:32:18.147]  Right.
[01:32:18.187 --> 01:32:25.116]  I mean, in fact, that's the best indication that you have that a story is true, is that people happen on it from multiple different starting points.
[01:32:25.316 --> 01:32:27.319]  That's how you know that you're really on to something.
[01:32:27.359 --> 01:32:32.986]  And so, I love the fact that you and I have arrived at a similar place from very different starting points.
[01:32:33.066 --> 01:32:35.449]  That's confirmation that it's real.
[01:32:36.325 --> 01:32:40.771]  Alright, shifting gears out of that then, what do you make of the hysteria over Tucker?
[01:32:41.172 --> 01:32:54.547]   Hundreds of millions of views on X, billions have seen clips of it, one of the biggest interviews ever, it's like moon landing level coverage, and then you've got him calling him a traitor, Boris Johnson, Democrats want The espionage act to be used.
[01:32:54.967 --> 01:32:56.168]  I mean, this is shameful.
[01:32:56.208 --> 01:32:57.288]  This is hysterical.
[01:32:57.348 --> 01:33:04.432]  This is, what is your view as someone that's researched what freedom is about, academia, all of this.
[01:33:04.472 --> 01:33:14.036]  I mean, this is, this is, and then the Putin interview was really, I mean, I thought him just kind of giving up saying, we'll never be friends.
[01:33:14.076 --> 01:33:14.896]  You never want to stop.
[01:33:15.416 --> 01:33:18.118]  And basically we're never, you're never going to dominate us.
[01:33:18.178 --> 01:33:18.958]  So that's the way it is.
[01:33:19.653 --> 01:33:23.957]  Yeah, I find the reaction to Tucker revealing.
[01:33:24.638 --> 01:33:26.179]  For one thing, I know Tucker.
[01:33:27.225 --> 01:33:28.565]  And I quite like him.
[01:33:28.805 --> 01:33:34.046]  He's a very decent guy, and I know... Oh, when you're in person, you pick up 10 Times Stronger than we see on TV.
[01:33:34.086 --> 01:33:36.307]  This is a real Santa Claus type.
[01:33:36.327 --> 01:33:37.307]  This is a sweetheart.
[01:33:37.487 --> 01:33:46.088]  Well, like you, he is a conservative who loves other Americans, even who don't share his ideology.
[01:33:46.188 --> 01:33:49.389]  He very much appreciates nature and wants to see it protected.
[01:33:49.409 --> 01:33:54.870]  So, you know, as far as I can tell, this is the real deal.
[01:33:55.470 --> 01:34:05.358]   And, of course, The fact of a journalist going to interview a foreign leader who is in many ways hostile to the U.S.
[01:34:05.398 --> 01:34:11.002]  and to the West, that is perfectly in keeping with the principles that make the West work.
[01:34:11.423 --> 01:34:12.564]  Kennedy talked to Khrushchev.
[01:34:12.584 --> 01:34:13.625]  We didn't blow ourselves up.
[01:34:13.785 --> 01:34:13.985]  Right.
[01:34:14.445 --> 01:34:20.271]  So this is just simply a matter of holding somebody to a different standard because it allows you to tear them down.
[01:34:21.264 --> 01:34:25.067]  Um, you know, I don't know what to make of what Putin said.
[01:34:25.087 --> 01:34:33.655]  I did find it, uh, there was something interesting about how different culturally his approach to this interview was.
[01:34:33.835 --> 01:34:47.967]  You know, it was obviously mired in, you know, historical questions of, in my opinion, limited relevance to... He was arguing his legal right, you know, because this is ours, instead of using the opportunity.
[01:34:48.507 --> 01:34:48.747]  Right.
[01:34:49.188 --> 01:35:01.881]  But nonetheless, in terms of whether there's anything questionable about Carlson going there to interview him, no, I'm glad he did go there to interview him because we need to know, even just need to know what Putin sounds like to himself.
[01:35:02.061 --> 01:35:06.546]  That's useful information from the perspective of protecting ourselves from Putin.
[01:35:06.666 --> 01:35:07.246]  Exactly.
[01:35:07.266 --> 01:35:12.338]   And boy, wasn't he paradox to see Joe Biden, who can't even string a sentence
[01:35:12.338 --> 01:35:13.748]  together, versus Putin.
[01:35:13.748 --> 01:35:19.648]   You got, whether you love Putin, hate him, or neutral, this guy runs a nuclear power,
[01:35:19.648 --> 01:35:21.148]  this guy's in charge.
[01:35:21.148 --> 01:35:23.949]   You're talking to the leader, and this guy knows what he's talking about.
[01:35:23.949 --> 01:35:26.788]  Whether you agree or not, this guy's not an idiot.
[01:35:26.788 --> 01:35:27.788]  Right.
[01:35:27.788 --> 01:35:31.708]   I mean, you know, it's a fact-finding mission, and he was doing the job of a journalist,
[01:35:31.708 --> 01:35:33.949]  and it was refreshing to see it.
[01:35:33.933 --> 01:35:40.580]  So I think the controversy over it is entirely synthetic and just designed to tear somebody down.
[01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:45.845]  But it also goes to the incompetence, because the Streisand effect... I'm not a rocket scientist, folks.
[01:35:45.905 --> 01:35:47.366]  I'm like, hey, Tucker, it's great you're being attacked.
[01:35:47.406 --> 01:35:50.269]  If we'd done this bigger, if they'd have just shut up, it would have had 20 million views.
[01:35:51.124 --> 01:35:53.545]  Right, they did turn it into a phenomenon.
[01:35:54.205 --> 01:36:01.406]  So why aren't they smart enough to see, first order, you demonize Tucker, you're discredited, it only makes him bigger, and the interview is 20 times bigger?
[01:36:02.146 --> 01:36:03.227]  Like, a fool would know that!
[01:36:03.447 --> 01:36:07.748]  Well, so I actually think this goes to another set of questions.
[01:36:08.368 --> 01:36:21.969]   So I, as a COVID dissident who watched us outfox the official narratives and those who were spreading it, I think a lot about the force that we're up against.
[01:36:22.569 --> 01:36:32.013]  And my model, which I did talk about on my first interview with Tucker a couple months ago, is that we're up against something that I call Goliath.
[01:36:32.273 --> 01:36:40.136]  And Goliath is partly built of a cabal or several cabals, and it's partly an emergent phenomenon.
[01:36:42.436 --> 01:36:46.478]  It is ferociously powerful, but it's also stupid.
[01:36:47.697 --> 01:36:52.661]  It is relatively easy to beat if it is not on territory where it is dominant.
[01:36:52.841 --> 01:36:54.903]  And so this means a couple things.
[01:36:55.143 --> 01:37:05.032]  One, it means those of us who are fighting that force should always keep in mind that getting Goliath on our territory, not its territory, is the way to beat it.
[01:37:05.192 --> 01:37:07.914]  You can beat it easily if it's off its footing.
[01:37:09.576 --> 01:37:11.497]  That's why we marched into a trap on January 6th.
[01:37:11.858 --> 01:37:13.019]  We went into Goliath's territory.
[01:37:13.619 --> 01:37:15.940]  Right, exactly, and it was scripted.
[01:37:16.361 --> 01:37:33.170]  So the fact that Carlson, like you, like Joe Rogan, has established an outpost that is not supposed to exist, right, an unsanctioned kind of media, that's not Goliath's territory.
[01:37:33.190 --> 01:37:54.505]   And in fact, Goliath made the terrible error during COVID of imagining that Off-brand media didn't matter when in fact it mattered ever more as people Detected that what they were getting on the mainstream channels was not true and in fact was capable of harming them They started listening to other people who were making sense and piecing it together.
[01:37:54.585 --> 01:38:12.260]   And so in any case I think what's going on is is that Carlson powerfully demonstrated that you could actually take the off-brand media and you could start doing the job that a newspaper might once have done with a newsroom full of reporters traveling the world, that sort of thing.
[01:38:12.802 --> 01:38:14.263]  Wow, I'm so impressed, man.
[01:38:14.463 --> 01:38:18.287]  That's why I love your podcast, because you say things in a really slick way.
[01:38:18.707 --> 01:38:19.808]  I'm sitting at home thinking this.
[01:38:19.868 --> 01:38:27.755]  I'm like, Tucker is taking real journalism for the first time and bringing it to the new space.
[01:38:28.195 --> 01:38:31.758]  No one trusts the old system, but that was an old thing for real journalists and real reports.
[01:38:31.998 --> 01:38:33.820]  But they've so wrecked themselves, no one believes it.
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:36.943]  Even though they said the sky was blue or the oceans, you know, wet.
[01:38:37.583 --> 01:38:44.346]  And so Tucker's actually going into the new independent media that is the new dominant force and restarting real journalism.
[01:38:44.926 --> 01:38:45.706]  Right.
[01:38:45.746 --> 01:38:47.587]  Well, nitric oxide is a key.
[01:38:47.647 --> 01:38:49.708]  It's made by our own bodies again.
[01:38:50.108 --> 01:38:54.310]  It's made by L-citrulline and L-arginine, the amino acids.
[01:38:54.630 --> 01:38:55.550]  So we're fed.
[01:38:55.930 --> 01:38:57.911]  You can get it from beet powder and other things.
[01:38:58.051 --> 01:39:03.971]   The nitric oxide relaxes the endothelium, the vasculature, it relaxes the vein.
[01:39:03.971 --> 01:39:05.971]  It's a natural blood pressure.
[01:39:05.971 --> 01:39:11.631]   In fact, I use the two, Your Info Wars, I keep that on my shelf, and I feed myself
[01:39:11.631 --> 01:39:14.891]  the Cardio Miracle, which is just for straight food.
[01:39:14.891 --> 01:39:19.391]   It's a different formulation than that one, and the two together are a one-two punch.

[01:40:09.358 --> 01:40:11.917]  You've looked at our formula, you like it?
[01:40:11.917 --> 01:40:13.078]  I did and I do.
[01:40:13.204 --> 01:40:13.504]  Yes.
[01:40:14.505 --> 01:40:15.485]  I'm not a scientist like you.
[01:40:15.525 --> 01:40:18.027]  What do these compounds do creating nitrous oxide?
[01:40:18.047 --> 01:40:18.607]  What does it do?
[01:40:19.068 --> 01:40:23.731]  It relaxes the vasculature, so the clot will go through and not restrict.
[01:40:24.091 --> 01:40:25.672]  It allows it to relax.
[01:40:25.732 --> 01:40:34.274]   It lowers the blood pressure, has the toxic synthetic lipid nanoparticles similar to the one in the
[01:40:34.274 --> 01:40:39.644]   COVID shot. Prior to the COVID shot, the deadliest vaccine, we saw athletes dropping dead on the
[01:40:39.644 --> 01:40:44.904]   field, passing out, falling down, all the things. Why is it particularly the athletes?
[01:40:44.904 --> 01:40:49.715]   Because they operate at oxygen max, capacity max.
[01:40:49.885 --> 01:40:54.051]  They're, they're operating at such a high level in their mitochondria.
[01:40:54.091 --> 01:40:58.637]  This is an energy production, oxygen, um, necessary disease.
[01:40:59.177 --> 01:41:01.060]  So they create, that's what they're finding.
[01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:02.402]  They turbocharge the blood clots.
[01:41:02.622 --> 01:41:05.342]  and an ectheme, a lack of oxygen.
[01:41:05.342 --> 01:41:10.222]   So constricted blood vessels too, because athletes are running, they're constricted,
[01:41:10.222 --> 01:41:16.922]   they're working so that the blood flows and it doesn't flow, which is why your nitric oxide product,
[01:41:16.922 --> 01:41:21.542]   that new product, I hope you'll show it 'cause that's a very important thing to have

[01:41:42.204 --> 01:41:42.464]  It's a 360 win.
[01:41:45.345 --> 01:42:16.112]   Interestingly, I think that is creating a, it is taking a kind of institution that came about in the podcast space that got kicked into high gear over COVID, and it's moving it to the next level, which actually reflects, I was recently in the Czech Republic, and I was thrilled to find That the values that I consider values of Western civilization are alive and well in the Czech Republic in a way I wasn't expecting to see.
[01:42:16.813 --> 01:42:31.225]   And anyway, I was trying to piece together why this was, did the Iron Curtain protect this spirit in the Czech Republic from Forces in the market that have taken it apart here at home.
[01:42:31.245 --> 01:42:50.863]   In any case, I was thinking about Václav Havel, the leader of the Czech Republic, and I was alerted that there was another Václav Benda, who I hadn't heard of, who actually makes this argument that the way To win this battle is to build parallel institutions.
[01:42:50.943 --> 01:42:58.725]  So I wonder if that's not in effect what we're watching is, okay, if the media is going to refuse to report the news, then we're going to build it outside.
[01:42:59.125 --> 01:43:06.406]  If the universities are going to refuse to educate inside those structures, then we're going to do it outside on the internet, right?
[01:43:06.466 --> 01:43:13.668]  That's what's happening is the parallel institutions are rising to displace the feeble, broken, corrupted institutions that refuse to function.
[01:43:14.502 --> 01:43:15.564]  That's perfectly said.
[01:43:15.624 --> 01:43:16.786]  That's absolutely true.
[01:43:18.530 --> 01:43:18.990]  Exactly.
[01:43:19.010 --> 01:43:21.816]  Nietzsche said, that which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.
[01:43:23.118 --> 01:43:25.102]  And if you look at segregation, it was a horrible crime.
[01:43:25.142 --> 01:43:26.063]  Jim Crow, terrible.
[01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:35.901]  My dad grew up in East Texas and he said, no, that when I was a kid, the black people had better hotels or better as good a restaurants, everything because they were suppressed.
[01:43:36.702 --> 01:43:38.705]  They then had built their own thing.
[01:43:39.326 --> 01:43:41.349]  And so we're not defending those institutions.
[01:43:41.369 --> 01:43:44.453]  We're simply saying that because they were under communism suppression.
[01:43:45.869 --> 01:44:01.142]  They'd already kind of been at the bottom, then they come out of it, but they're still not Western, so they weren't infected by the neoliberal corporate, you know, mind control, and so they still had kind of that suppressed instinct of freedom left, and that was soil for it to sprout from.
[01:44:01.670 --> 01:44:02.251]  Absolutely.
[01:44:02.491 --> 01:44:12.622]  And it also means that they are in a position, potentially, to save the world from what's taking place in the World Health Organization.
[01:44:13.242 --> 01:44:21.972]  The World Health Organization is involved in effectively rewriting the rules in preparation for some sort of pandemic rematch.
[01:44:22.772 --> 01:44:24.273]  That was my next question for you.
[01:44:25.053 --> 01:44:28.494]  Right here, Bill Gates planning, overhead shot guys, real quick, that was my next question.
[01:44:28.514 --> 01:44:29.354]  You read my mind here.
[01:44:29.655 --> 01:44:30.355]  We're simpatico.
[01:44:30.815 --> 01:44:35.957]  Bill Gates planning for Pandemic 2, complete with new vaccines administered from a little patch.
[01:44:35.997 --> 01:44:38.998]  So they're saying, Ted Rose is saying it's imminent, so speak to that.
[01:44:39.618 --> 01:44:56.729]   So the World Health Organization is cryptically Writing the rule set that would have allowed Goliath to win the COVID battle, where Goliath ended up embarrassed by those of us on the outside exposing the lies that were being told.
[01:44:56.749 --> 01:44:58.610]  So they see the last four years as a war game?
[01:44:59.171 --> 01:45:04.634]  Well, I always say that Goliath has to be dragged onto territory that it doesn't know.
[01:45:05.075 --> 01:45:06.196]  But it now knows.
[01:45:06.436 --> 01:45:08.837]  COVID taught it what podcast space was.
[01:45:08.897 --> 01:45:11.179]  It taught us what the alternative media could do.
[01:45:11.639 --> 01:45:13.921]  And so Goliath is now learning that lesson.
[01:45:14.481 --> 01:45:20.326]  And Goliath is trying to build the rules that would allow it to win COVID if it had it to do over.
[01:45:20.846 --> 01:45:24.308]  So that's flowing through the World Health Organization.
[01:45:24.449 --> 01:45:26.470]  It will be voted on in May.
[01:45:26.530 --> 01:45:27.531]  There are two things.
[01:45:27.591 --> 01:45:36.177]  There is a pandemic preparedness treaty and international health regulations, and they are absolutely diabolical if you read the content of them.
[01:45:36.478 --> 01:45:37.038]  Oh, I've read it.
[01:45:37.098 --> 01:45:37.718]  It's scary.
[01:45:38.539 --> 01:45:51.942]  It's terrifying and I mean it includes insane things like the right of the World Health Organization to mandate not only vaccines but gene therapy to redistribute medical technology.
[01:45:51.982 --> 01:46:00.963]  So imagine that you know instead of the battle over ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine that we saw that the WHO could just dictate that those things be moved somewhere else and you would have no access to them.
[01:46:01.223 --> 01:46:06.385]   So all of those... So it's a biomedical corporate It is.
[01:46:06.985 --> 01:46:10.567]  And it really looks like they're looking for a rematch.
[01:46:11.047 --> 01:46:13.488]  So we have to derail that thing.
[01:46:13.929 --> 01:46:18.211]  By the way, you convinced Tucker of this, and I'm not saying I'm smarter than Tucker, he's smarter than me in most ways.
[01:46:18.611 --> 01:46:20.732]  He's like, come on, Alex, we were talking on the phone like six months ago.
[01:46:21.492 --> 01:46:25.414]  And when I saw him like four months, three months ago, he goes, they're not going to try it again, we just beat their ass.
[01:46:25.434 --> 01:46:26.775]  And I said, they want a rematch.
[01:46:27.155 --> 01:46:28.776]  Everything I see is it was a war game.
[01:46:29.276 --> 01:46:31.757]  And he now says you convinced him.
[01:46:33.118 --> 01:46:37.919]  They are looking for a rematch, but the fact is they are now faltering.
[01:46:38.459 --> 01:46:40.340]  Because we're on the offense exposing it.
[01:46:40.500 --> 01:46:48.101]  We're on the offense exposing it, and folks in Eastern Europe, in fact, are recognizing that they are actually in a unique position.
[01:46:48.121 --> 01:46:50.422]  Yeah, they've got prime ministers and stuff calling them all out.
[01:46:50.622 --> 01:46:55.243]  Right, in Romania there is a very live resistance movement.
[01:46:55.363 --> 01:46:56.523]  Stop interrupting, continue.
[01:46:56.703 --> 01:46:58.804]  Well, all I'm saying is... Start over, start over.
[01:46:59.304 --> 01:47:13.962]   Look, to me, Western civilization is fundamentally about an agreement to put aside our lineages, our races, and to collaborate with each other on the basis that there are things to be accomplished.
[01:47:14.423 --> 01:47:18.165]  And that is the magic that made America as powerful as it was.
[01:47:18.185 --> 01:47:20.026]  Goals, not race, religion.
[01:47:20.086 --> 01:47:20.266]  Goals.
[01:47:20.286 --> 01:47:21.147]  Right, exactly.
[01:47:21.707 --> 01:47:22.068]  Outcome.
[01:47:22.828 --> 01:47:23.668]  Well, let's put it this way.
[01:47:24.289 --> 01:47:34.433]  How successful are you going to be if you have to collaborate only with people who look like you versus how successful will you be if you can collaborate with whoever has the most useful tools to bring to the table?
[01:47:34.453 --> 01:47:35.834]  But you've got to have shared goals.
[01:47:36.034 --> 01:47:36.194]  Right.
[01:47:36.334 --> 01:47:38.795]  If they take the goals away now, it makes it a weakness.
[01:47:39.115 --> 01:47:40.196]  With goals, it makes it a strength.
[01:47:40.356 --> 01:47:42.818]  Well, I would say those goals are values, right?
[01:47:42.838 --> 01:47:53.148]  If we share values and then we collaborate on how to accomplish them, that's powerful and it made America truly great and tremendously powerful.
[01:47:53.608 --> 01:48:12.935]   So, America is now compromised by whatever has taken over our political structures, but Folks in Eastern Europe are now beginning to recognize that they hold the values that we once held so dear, and that they're in a position to protect us from things like what's taking place in the World Health Organization.
[01:48:13.236 --> 01:48:23.179]  So that's what I'm hoping will happen, is that they will shine, that they will rise to this challenge, and they will derail this diabolical proposal to the good of all of humanity.
[01:48:24.679 --> 01:48:31.485]  Wow, well that sounds optimistic and I think it is optimistic, but what do you make just of the cut-and-dry situation in Ukraine?
[01:48:32.145 --> 01:48:36.509]  NATO's been defeated, they're doubling down, Putin's not perfect, but clearly they started the war.
[01:48:36.529 --> 01:48:40.333]  NATO started it, from my perspective, if you disagree, tell me, nine years ago.
[01:48:41.113 --> 01:48:45.877]  And it's one thing to go blow up the Iraqis, and I'm not saying Saddam was perfect, but lie about WMDs.
[01:48:46.237 --> 01:48:53.864]  Now you're starting a war with a highly sophisticated civilization that has a thousand year history of being invaded over and over again and doesn't give up.
[01:48:54.204 --> 01:48:57.807]  I mean, it's like starting a fight with Mike Tyson in his prime.
[01:48:57.847 --> 01:48:58.647]  It's just dumb.
[01:48:59.108 --> 01:48:59.968]  So what are they thinking?
[01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:02.150]  Well, that's always the question.
[01:49:03.612 --> 01:49:08.796]  You have to ask yourself the question, are they just being foolish?
[01:49:09.136 --> 01:49:11.198]  Or do they know something we don't know?
[01:49:11.218 --> 01:49:19.030]   And I also wonder about How to categorize the force that makes these decisions, right?
[01:49:19.151 --> 01:49:27.215]  I see the United States leadership making decision after decision that is obviously terrible for the citizenry.
[01:49:27.495 --> 01:49:28.996]  And undermines the establishment.
[01:49:29.236 --> 01:49:29.456]  Right.
[01:49:29.776 --> 01:49:35.299]  So is that that something has gotten into our system and is inducing us to hurt ourselves?
[01:49:35.660 --> 01:49:36.380]  That's possible.
[01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:38.221]  Is it just stupidity?
[01:49:38.261 --> 01:49:39.322]  That's also possible.
[01:49:39.902 --> 01:49:52.310]   So when we pick a fight, You have to ask the question about whether there is an objective we don't know, or whether this is just insanity that has taken over the system.
[01:49:53.271 --> 01:50:03.229]   And I really don't know the answer to that question, but I do know that the emergent part of Goliath There are lots of things that can cause people to sign on to bad policy.
[01:50:03.449 --> 01:50:11.698]  So, for example, the fact that we had warehouses full of weaponry that meant that we didn't need to buy more.
[01:50:12.158 --> 01:50:17.044]  If you can unload that weaponry onto a foreign battlefield, then suddenly the order's flowing.
[01:50:17.064 --> 01:50:17.624]  Well, that's what it is.
[01:50:17.684 --> 01:50:25.284]   It's a council of different factions who will come and all just agree with each other.
[01:50:25.284 --> 01:50:29.603]   Okay, you want to sell more weapons and get rid of your cash, you can start World War
[01:50:29.603 --> 01:50:32.484]  III and not think, well, wait.
[01:50:32.484 --> 01:50:33.923]  And then blowing up Nord Stream.
[01:50:34.039 --> 01:50:35.439]  Now Europe's collapsing.
[01:50:35.699 --> 01:50:37.159]  Everybody knows the CIA did it.
[01:50:37.179 --> 01:50:40.760]  It is scary.
[01:50:41.181 --> 01:50:55.965]  Yes, and I think it's the kind of thing that is very difficult to accomplish if people have a normal relationship with their own mortality and their own progeny.
[01:50:56.741 --> 01:51:03.388]  If you love your children, you don't start World War III, even if it makes sense on a balance sheet somewhere to do it.
[01:51:03.948 --> 01:51:09.073]  Yes, maybe if you're in an elite position, you'll earn some money that your kids will inherit.
[01:51:09.634 --> 01:51:11.956]  On the other hand, you're wrecking their planet.
[01:51:12.316 --> 01:51:13.838]  And so that would give people pause.
[01:51:14.418 --> 01:51:16.660]  I think you answered the question, Doctor.
[01:51:17.381 --> 01:51:45.331]  For 50, 60, 70, 80 years, 100 years with the robber barons, they've been hiring yes men and yes women that'll just do what they're told, but then they've graduated up to the command positions and they're yes men who aren't even war gaming things and it's a runaway train and all they're doing is be engaged in predator activity of just accumulating wealth, not understanding they're undermining the very civilization that would let them spend that wealth.
[01:51:47.847 --> 01:51:53.192]  There's something at the core of this dysfunction that is about incompetence.
[01:51:53.892 --> 01:52:10.967]  And if you've lived inside a system, if you've been inside the university system, let's say as a scientist as I was, and you've watched that the majority of every department is composed of people who, although they are fully convinced they are engaged in behaving scientifically, are just simply not.
[01:52:11.307 --> 01:52:12.168]  They're not good at it.
[01:52:14.233 --> 01:52:22.189]  What is it that took something as important as science and hijacked it for purposes presumably mostly economic?
[01:52:23.149 --> 01:52:30.073]  What is it that caused us... I mean, look at what we did with the mandates to our own military, right?
[01:52:30.393 --> 01:52:37.918]  We inflicted something on the military that drove out all of the people who are likely to stand up... And they turned around and say, sorry, come back!
[01:52:38.458 --> 01:52:40.239]  Right, but... We weren't even thinking!
[01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:49.605]  We don't know whether what they did was the result of massive stupidity or whether they were trying to create a compliant force.
[01:52:49.725 --> 01:52:50.766]  But we know it didn't work.
[01:52:50.806 --> 01:52:52.527]  They came back and reversed it.
[01:52:53.308 --> 01:52:54.129]  Well, they tried to.
[01:52:54.309 --> 01:52:57.491]  You're right, it hasn't reversed the problem.
[01:52:57.811 --> 01:52:58.892]  I'm saying they reversed the policy.
[01:52:58.932 --> 01:53:08.019]  They reversed the policy, but now people are loathe to join the military because they know that such a policy can come down the pike and it can put them in a terrible...
[01:53:08.599 --> 01:53:23.665]  All right, the 10 minutes we have left, I'm a big fan, love you on the show, love seeing you on other shows, and people have been attacking you, we kind of started with this, but maybe we should end with it, about, well, this guy, you know, didn't have a perfect pedigree fighting the New World Order.
[01:53:24.065 --> 01:53:27.726]  There's not many people out there that have been doing this 30 years like I am.
[01:53:28.066 --> 01:53:30.587]  There's some other great people out there that have done it as well, and we love them to death.
[01:53:32.888 --> 01:53:38.492]  Is to learn from other people, and then they learn from me, and then we have a consensus and we fix things.
[01:53:38.932 --> 01:53:39.953]  I want to win this.
[01:53:40.413 --> 01:53:48.059]  I don't want to sit around and say, this is the most holy of all our people, and then this person was always perfect, and this person, no, no.
[01:53:48.479 --> 01:53:55.284]  We need people like the doctor here who is smart, entertaining, popular, who's joined us.
[01:53:55.664 --> 01:53:58.586]  When Joe Rogan, known 25 years, he just wanted to have fun.
[01:53:59.027 --> 01:54:01.909]  He's been awake a few years, now he's more hardcore than I am.

[01:54:31.721 --> 01:54:34.283]  Tucker came here 11 years ago and said, man, I thought you were cooking wrong.
[01:54:34.643 --> 01:54:35.503]  I woke up, you're right.
[01:54:35.523 --> 01:54:38.385]  I've influenced him, he's influenced me.
[01:54:38.565 --> 01:54:42.468]  I've learned my own personal power of persuasion.
[01:54:42.508 --> 01:54:46.750]  Not that I'm the grand poobah or the best guy around, but I've seen the power of debate.
[01:54:47.251 --> 01:54:48.271]  I've seen we can win.
[01:54:48.411 --> 01:54:50.172]  I've seen we can come together.
[01:54:50.513 --> 01:54:56.857]  I know humans are overall good, but this holier-than-thou stuff, folks, is a disease.
[01:54:57.799 --> 01:55:10.211]  And it's in the left, where you've got to prescribe to every leftist ideology that's put out by some think tank, and then when that's all agreed to, now there's a new group wanting power over it that makes it even more radical.
[01:55:11.141 --> 01:55:12.062]  That is a disease.
[01:55:12.102 --> 01:55:12.682]  Can you speak to that?
[01:55:13.103 --> 01:55:13.443]  Sure.
[01:55:13.943 --> 01:55:23.471]  Yes, I've been watching this and I'm horrified by it because I have the sense that people are fighting over credit at halftime and that they're going to screw up the game.
[01:55:23.531 --> 01:55:25.493]  We're going to lose it because we're fighting.
[01:55:25.513 --> 01:55:27.094]  They're watching the scoreboard during the game.
[01:55:27.314 --> 01:55:27.555]  Right.
[01:55:27.855 --> 01:55:29.396]  But they don't get that it's halftime.
[01:55:29.696 --> 01:55:37.002]   And the fact is, We all have everything to gain by leveling up together.
[01:55:37.282 --> 01:55:38.283]  That's what we should be doing.
[01:55:39.044 --> 01:55:52.974]  And, you know, for people to look at Joe Rogan or Tucker Carlson or me or you and say, oh, they're controlled opposition because they were taken in by, you know, the COVID narrative or something.
[01:55:53.074 --> 01:55:54.395]  Or X. Right.
[01:55:54.635 --> 01:56:09.531]   The fact is, A, you know, you can start with a cynical position that says nothing anybody ever tells you is right, and yeah, you will not buy any bullshit if that's where you start from, but you also won't be able to detect anything useful.
[01:56:09.551 --> 01:56:10.672]  You're not going to leave your house.
[01:56:10.972 --> 01:56:11.172]  Right.
[01:56:11.472 --> 01:56:14.214]  You're literally, if you just think everything is controlled, it's not.
[01:56:14.274 --> 01:56:15.335]  Folks, I'm real.
[01:56:15.796 --> 01:56:16.476]  Okay, I'm real.
[01:56:16.616 --> 01:56:18.278]  I know I've changed the world with working with you.
[01:56:18.678 --> 01:56:19.619]  I know there's good people.
[01:56:19.999 --> 01:56:20.880]  I know we can fix this.
[01:56:20.900 --> 01:56:21.480]  We've got to.
[01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:23.122]  Dammit, there's not just evil.
[01:56:23.562 --> 01:56:24.703]  There's not just evil.
[01:56:24.983 --> 01:56:32.829]  No, in fact, there are great people who are interested, who share values, and are putting aside ideology, and that is an incredibly powerful thing.
[01:56:33.249 --> 01:56:38.673]  So, look, in my case, what I want is I want people to judge my whole record.
[01:56:39.505 --> 01:56:42.107]  Was I advocating for people to wear masks?
[01:56:42.467 --> 01:56:43.248]  Yeah, I was.
[01:56:43.428 --> 01:56:48.753]  I thought that stood a chance of actually reducing the spread of a disease that I thought was more serious than it turns out to be.
[01:56:48.773 --> 01:56:51.315]  Out of abundance of caution and when you learned you were wrong, you went public.
[01:56:51.455 --> 01:56:52.436]  I changed it.
[01:56:52.456 --> 01:56:53.016]  So who cares?
[01:56:53.196 --> 01:56:55.278]  And now you're a huge advocate for truth, so who cares?
[01:56:55.478 --> 01:57:00.702]  Well, look, there was a little bit of harm done by people wearing masks as a result of my advocating for them.
[01:57:00.982 --> 01:57:07.807]  But there was a lot of good done by, A, people watching me wake up to the foolishness of the mask.
[01:57:07.887 --> 01:57:10.889]  But doctor, that's what the globalists fear, whistleblowers.
[01:57:11.710 --> 01:57:14.332]  They fear people that at first were a little wrong.
[01:57:15.072 --> 01:57:21.237]  And if we don't embrace powerful, smart people like you when they join the awakening, no one else is going to do it.
[01:57:21.477 --> 01:57:21.617]  Right.
[01:57:22.057 --> 01:57:22.558]  Exactly.
[01:57:22.638 --> 01:57:29.023]  And so just all I would say is for all of us, just, just judge us based on the net impact we have had.
[01:57:30.094 --> 01:57:35.838]  There's no way that this is a limited hangout when we are doing damage to Goliath's narrative.
[01:57:35.878 --> 01:57:38.901]  We are revealing what he wants people to believe.
[01:57:38.921 --> 01:57:47.467]  I go to the grocery store, I go to church, I see family, and they go, oh, we love that professor, that doctor, that Dr. Brett Weinstein, and he's really great.
[01:57:47.888 --> 01:57:48.989]  People, you're a smart guy.
[01:57:49.029 --> 01:57:49.649]  You're entertaining.
[01:57:49.689 --> 01:57:51.330]  You're great.
[01:57:51.711 --> 01:57:52.611]  You can talk about any subject.
[01:57:52.892 --> 01:57:53.832]  You're a great guy.
[01:57:53.852 --> 01:57:54.773]  And this is something I want to say.
[01:57:55.314 --> 01:57:57.775]  I always sat back on air for 30 years in April.
[01:57:58.636 --> 01:58:00.297]  And said, I don't think I myself was the best.
[01:58:01.238 --> 01:58:02.358]  And I'm doing this, trying to do this.
[01:58:02.378 --> 01:58:05.560]  I said, where are all these professional men and women I know?
[01:58:05.580 --> 01:58:08.782]  And then I see that I know are smart and know what's going on.
[01:58:09.543 --> 01:58:17.367]  Because they were asleep or they were only focused with blinders on, you know, kind of a wormhole, a tunnel vision on what they were doing.
[01:58:17.708 --> 01:58:26.636]   But I believe, and I've said this for 25 years, that once things got bad, we would get The professors and the scientists and the researchers on our side.
[01:58:26.997 --> 01:58:32.304]  And when it starts to happen and the avalanche is to us, we just literally beat the hell out of Big Pharma.
[01:58:32.605 --> 01:58:34.147]  Their stock's going straight down.
[01:58:34.508 --> 01:58:35.469]  No one's taking their crap.
[01:58:35.509 --> 01:58:36.050]  We're winning.
[01:58:36.350 --> 01:58:38.333]  And then we turn into this, this, this.
[01:58:38.974 --> 01:58:45.156]  Like Spanish Inquisition or something going around to find out if somebody's a heretic or were they perfect.
[01:58:45.456 --> 01:58:47.296]  Folks, the big win is here.
[01:58:47.797 --> 01:58:50.357]  We have got to stop because they're ready for a rematch.
[01:58:50.677 --> 01:58:52.198]  They're coming in for another attack.
[01:58:52.458 --> 01:58:54.919]  We better get together and we better stop it.
[01:58:55.699 --> 01:59:09.712]   Yeah, and it is the result in part of this very unfortunate fact, which is the people who are independent minded The Lone Wolves, who actually do see through things early, are often not very good at teaming up.
[01:59:09.932 --> 01:59:21.614]  It's a paradox, because collectivists are very good at teaming up, but then a central system can pay them and do it, whereas independent people are some of the best thinkers, but they'll never want to team up.
[01:59:21.954 --> 01:59:22.174]  Right.
[01:59:22.234 --> 01:59:23.414]  So how do you deal with that paradox?
[01:59:23.774 --> 01:59:34.697]   Well, I mean, look, I think a lot of this is solved metaphorically, and what I do is I think in terms of the stories in which We all appreciate this.
[01:59:34.998 --> 01:59:41.222]  You know, the Lord of the Rings, or the ragtag fugitive fleet from Battlestar Galactica.
[01:59:41.582 --> 01:59:58.655]  And the point is, look, maybe you don't start out with that skill set, but you can develop that skill set, and if you think about it, just quietly to yourself for a moment, you'll realize that the only way we're going to win is if we figure out who to team up with and how to do it.
[01:59:59.315 --> 02:00:17.989]  So anyway, that's a skill we can develop and we should be working on it every day because, as Alex just said, the victory is there to be had, but we are going to end up going out of the frying pan and into the fire if we don't figure out how to overcome our tendency to attack each other.
[02:00:19.470 --> 02:00:21.912]  Let's talk about the paradox of Elon Musk.
[02:00:22.625 --> 02:00:27.889]  Look, I've got Elon's number, I don't mean literally, I mean I've got, I can see the cut of his jib.
[02:00:28.490 --> 02:00:36.456]  He's a scientist, he's a promoter, he's a salesman, he's a really smart guy, has incredible energy, and he wants to dominate every scientific development that's out there.
[02:00:37.717 --> 02:00:43.141]  He wants to be, you know, the Spradley Sprockets of George Jetson world.
[02:00:45.528 --> 02:00:46.528]  He's all over the place.
[02:00:47.028 --> 02:00:50.528]   The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[02:00:50.528 --> 02:00:55.927]   But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of "is it pro-human
[02:00:55.927 --> 02:00:58.168]  or is it anti-human?" we start to win.
[02:00:58.168 --> 02:01:00.168]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[02:01:00.168 --> 02:01:01.367]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[02:01:01.367 --> 02:01:02.528]  He loved the idea.
[02:01:02.528 --> 02:01:05.927]   What would you call the debate and discussions about a pro-human future?
[02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:06.820]  Just Team Humanity?
[02:01:06.900 --> 02:01:07.781]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[02:01:07.941 --> 02:01:08.381]  Absolutely.
[02:01:08.701 --> 02:01:10.062]  And so, we have the t-shirt.
[02:01:10.162 --> 02:01:13.564]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family, standing against the globalists.
[02:01:13.824 --> 02:01:21.268]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to keep InfoWars on the air, so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[02:01:21.508 --> 02:01:33.254]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a revolution against the globalists, and it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[02:01:33.534 --> 02:01:34.854]  We're told humans are the problem.
[02:01:34.874 --> 02:01:35.875]  We're told we're killing the Earth.
[02:01:36.155 --> 02:01:40.417]  We're told all this garbage, so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[02:01:40.717 --> 02:01:41.417]  We're not going to do that.
[02:01:41.678 --> 02:01:46.300]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at mfullworthstore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[02:01:47.145 --> 02:01:53.605]  But as they mess with him and go after him and try to shut down his companies and make him bend and be their minion.
[02:01:54.827 --> 02:02:03.870]  He's come out against him and has done a lot to free up X, has done a lot with his own account, reaching hundreds of millions a day to do good work.
[02:02:03.930 --> 02:02:05.710]  So I can sit there and say, that's good work.
[02:02:06.150 --> 02:02:07.551]  Now, do I know all his motives?
[02:02:08.011 --> 02:02:08.271]  You know?
[02:02:08.751 --> 02:02:08.911]  No.
[02:02:09.031 --> 02:02:12.252]  I mean, I know myself, I'm a good person, but I have an evil side too.
[02:02:12.292 --> 02:02:14.632]  And I sometimes go, are you really being a good person?
[02:02:14.913 --> 02:02:19.814]  So I can't judge Elon Musk when I even have problems judging myself sometimes because I'm like 90% good.
[02:02:19.834 --> 02:02:35.042]   But also, you know, you have a subconscious that goes on there, but This idea that Elon Musk is working for the establishment when, as you point out, there's a lot of different factions that are like battling over the levers of control.
[02:02:35.623 --> 02:02:36.924]  I just don't see as fair.
[02:02:37.864 --> 02:02:40.006]  And then, OK, say we don't trust Elon.
[02:02:40.026 --> 02:02:41.426]  We've got to see what he does long term.
[02:02:42.067 --> 02:02:43.128]  Judge a tree by its fruits.
[02:02:44.505 --> 02:02:49.729]  Then don't spend 90% of your time saying Elon's a shill, Elon's a fraud.
[02:02:50.489 --> 02:02:56.033]  Say, okay, we don't totally trust you, Proviso, read the fine print, but boost all the great stuff he's doing.
[02:02:56.293 --> 02:02:59.736]  Because I look at what he's doing and it's enraging the EU.
[02:02:59.976 --> 02:03:01.337]  They're trying to indict him.
[02:03:01.357 --> 02:03:04.359]  He's got all these drug stories and all these attacks.
[02:03:04.459 --> 02:03:06.701]  I've been through this, but on a smaller scale.
[02:03:07.061 --> 02:03:09.142]  He's getting Trumpian level hate now.
[02:03:10.383 --> 02:03:16.147]   The globalists, the corrupt, illegitimate, Yeah, and I would add two things to it.
[02:03:16.047 --> 02:03:20.426]   Okay, you can't fake that and so I see a huge opportunity here
[02:03:20.426 --> 02:03:27.167]   We could lose Musk when he's trying to jump to our camp if we don't embrace him now if he does something wrong later
[02:03:27.167 --> 02:03:32.226]   We go hey wait, but if we don't He's trying to jump to us is what I see and if we don't
[02:03:32.226 --> 02:03:36.766]   grab him. He's not ours does that make sense yeah And I would add two things to it
[02:03:36.766 --> 02:03:43.386]   one Assuming that his story is accurate that he was injured by
[02:03:43.386 --> 02:03:45.855]   the mRNA shot And a family member.
[02:03:46.755 --> 02:03:46.955]  Right.
[02:03:47.816 --> 02:03:49.437]  Two of Joe Rogan's crew.
[02:03:49.477 --> 02:03:50.077]  He told me who.
[02:03:50.918 --> 02:03:52.378]  That's an old story.
[02:03:53.759 --> 02:03:57.101]  Two of the people close to Joe, I mean close, had strokes after it.
[02:03:57.301 --> 02:03:57.501]  Right.
[02:03:57.521 --> 02:03:59.182]  I'm sorry I'm interrupting.
[02:03:59.202 --> 02:03:59.422]  Go ahead.
[02:03:59.442 --> 02:03:59.702]  No, no.
[02:04:00.223 --> 02:04:01.183]  But my point would be this.
[02:04:03.024 --> 02:04:11.553]   If Elon got the shot and was hurt, Then he's not on the list of people who was in the know about the danger of that shot.
[02:04:11.714 --> 02:04:13.114]  He said that happened, I believe him.
[02:04:13.334 --> 02:04:14.295]  Right, I believe him too.
[02:04:14.615 --> 02:04:21.779]  So my point is, this is incompatible with him being some 4-D chess shill.
[02:04:22.279 --> 02:04:26.141]  If that story is true, then the point is, he's not on their team.
[02:04:26.641 --> 02:04:29.103]  He's, at least sometimes, on our team.
[02:04:29.123 --> 02:04:29.883]  He was victimized.
[02:04:31.584 --> 02:04:34.965]  Yeah, he was on their team earlier because he was buying the chili.
[02:04:35.525 --> 02:04:36.965]  Now he's like, what the hell?
[02:04:37.485 --> 02:04:41.186]  His brother got super sick, he got sick.
[02:04:41.226 --> 02:04:42.367]  That'll wake you up!
[02:04:43.787 --> 02:04:45.127]  Like nothing else, right?
[02:04:45.367 --> 02:04:48.428]  They literally injected something into you that makes you ill.
[02:04:48.968 --> 02:04:55.814]   But the other thing is what he's done with Twitter And believe me, there's plenty of fault left in Twitter.
[02:04:55.914 --> 02:05:01.995]  But what he's done is he has created an outpost of at least much freer speech.
[02:05:02.656 --> 02:05:06.377]  And we say on our podcast, zero is a special number.
[02:05:06.937 --> 02:05:14.679]  What we mean by that is that you can change these games by simply creating a single entity that departs from the rule.
[02:05:15.279 --> 02:05:26.564]  If you have one platform on which you can say what needs to be said, then every other platform has to follow suit because nobody's going to want to be on a platform where they treat you like a child if there's a platform where you can be an adult.
[02:05:26.984 --> 02:05:28.344]  Same thing goes for universities.
[02:05:28.385 --> 02:05:33.907]  If you have one university that's actually teaching you to think more clearly, then nobody wants to go to any other.
[02:05:33.967 --> 02:05:34.847]  It'll change the whole paradigm.
[02:05:34.867 --> 02:05:36.188]  It changes the whole game.
[02:05:36.308 --> 02:05:37.588]  Same thing goes for newspapers.
[02:05:37.628 --> 02:05:42.987]   And so anyway, my point is, Twitter X is better than it was.
[02:05:43.007 --> 02:05:45.649]  It is a maverick and it's got infiltrators.
[02:05:45.869 --> 02:05:46.990]  He bought this mess.
[02:05:47.210 --> 02:05:48.190]  He's done better than I thought he would.
[02:05:48.631 --> 02:05:51.012]  He's done better than you would think he would.
[02:05:51.432 --> 02:06:04.421]  And what that tells you is he's not, I don't know how complex the chess board that he's looking at is, but he can't be totally on their team because he's created a space where Tucker Carlson can say what needs to be said.
[02:06:04.481 --> 02:06:09.606]   I'm not a rocket scientist or a biologist like you, but The hate's legitimate.
[02:06:10.026 --> 02:06:16.114]  He's creating waves that even if they kill him tomorrow, God forbid, or shut it down, it's already devastated him.
[02:06:16.935 --> 02:06:18.316]  Folks, listen to me.
[02:06:18.356 --> 02:06:19.978]  I've been on air 30 years if I've heard you wrong.
[02:06:20.479 --> 02:06:23.122]  He's creating irrevocable harm to them.
[02:06:23.403 --> 02:06:24.824]  Like you said, this is real.
[02:06:26.006 --> 02:06:35.273]  Yeah, I think it is real, and I think we don't know who's working for whom, so the best we can do is say who is actually doing things.
[02:06:35.293 --> 02:06:35.894]  And he doesn't!
[02:06:35.914 --> 02:06:36.595]  Imagine his job!
[02:06:36.635 --> 02:06:38.376]  Double, triple agents, the betrayals.
[02:06:38.696 --> 02:06:42.039]  I can't imagine the complexity of what he has to look at, right?
[02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:53.049]  It's mind-boggling, and all of us who have never been in his shoes, which is frankly all of us, can't appreciate that level of complexity, so we owe it to him to at least give him the benefit of the doubt.
[02:06:53.769 --> 02:06:54.809]  Let's just see what happens.
[02:06:55.249 --> 02:06:55.730]  Absolutely.
[02:06:55.750 --> 02:06:56.910]  All right.
[02:06:56.970 --> 02:06:58.250]  Thank you so much for the time.
[02:06:58.270 --> 02:07:00.051]  Amazing doctor.
[02:07:00.631 --> 02:07:01.991]  Is there anything else you want to add to people?
[02:07:02.311 --> 02:07:07.433]  Yeah, there's one other thing, which is obviously I take a risk by coming here.
[02:07:07.693 --> 02:07:08.873]  I appreciate what you do.
[02:07:08.933 --> 02:07:09.993]  Oh, I recognize that.
[02:07:10.033 --> 02:07:10.794]  You got a lot of courage.
[02:07:10.874 --> 02:07:12.554]  You're playing a big ass target on you.
[02:07:12.794 --> 02:07:22.963]  Right, but I want to make the point that my ability to be here is something that was carved out by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson, who took that risk first.
[02:07:23.464 --> 02:07:33.813]  And I appreciate their carving out the ability to have this discussion, because at the end of the day, I believe you are a patriot and a very important force in this battle.
[02:07:33.833 --> 02:07:34.734]  Well, thank you.
[02:07:34.814 --> 02:07:36.655]  Elaborate for people that don't know the specifics.
[02:07:36.735 --> 02:07:38.337]  Explain what you mean, they carved it out.
[02:07:38.857 --> 02:07:47.259]  Well, they were willing, at the point that it was treated as unforgivable to talk to you, they did it anyway.
[02:07:47.540 --> 02:07:48.300]  What was heresy?
[02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:49.360]  Heresy.
[02:07:49.560 --> 02:07:50.460]  That's a good way of putting it.
[02:07:50.620 --> 02:07:56.362]  And so, in any case, I appreciate their courage and their willingness to risk their operations.
[02:07:56.402 --> 02:08:03.284]  They didn't have to do that, but they did it because it was the right thing, and it did make it possible for us smaller fish to follow suit.
[02:08:03.424 --> 02:08:04.304]  And let's explain that.
[02:08:04.464 --> 02:08:08.705]  In this paradox where they created this artificial Alex Jones, 10% of it was my fault.
[02:08:08.806 --> 02:08:12.647]  I did do some things that were wrong, but most of it was blown up, exaggerated, all controlled.
[02:08:13.267 --> 02:08:19.509]  But if Alex Jones is put up there as the symbol of evil, if he's allowed speech, everybody else is safe.
[02:08:20.269 --> 02:08:27.371]  And they, speaking of NATO, I don't know if you saw the document, but NATO said six years ago, we're going to ban Jones and we're going to ban WikiLeaks.
[02:08:27.451 --> 02:08:29.591]  And once we do that, well, everybody will follow suit.
[02:08:29.951 --> 02:08:30.572]  We'll ban it all.
[02:08:30.612 --> 02:08:35.083]   So they admitted that I'm not that important, but I became important when they
[02:08:35.083 --> 02:08:39.404]   picked me as the symbol of demonization and thought no one would stand with me.
[02:08:39.404 --> 02:08:44.004]   And now that Joe did and Elon and you came here knowing full well what you're doing,
[02:08:44.004 --> 02:08:48.284]   it's not that we agree on everything or any of that, unless you get the proviso out, even
[02:08:48.284 --> 02:08:52.604]   though we agree on most stuff, they'll lie about something I said and say, "Do you agree
[02:08:53.429 --> 02:08:58.112]  It's about agreeing to have a conversation and rediscovering what makes us great.
[02:08:58.392 --> 02:09:00.033]  So one more time, tell us about your book.
[02:09:00.333 --> 02:09:02.674]  Tell us how we follow you on Rumble and on Locals.
[02:09:04.051 --> 02:09:07.353]  The book is A Hunter-Gatherer's Guide to the 21st Century.
[02:09:08.154 --> 02:09:08.954]  You can get it anywhere.
[02:09:08.974 --> 02:09:11.556]  The podcast is Dark Horse.
[02:09:11.696 --> 02:09:12.496]  That's one word.
[02:09:12.777 --> 02:09:14.197]  Dark and horse are capitalized.
[02:09:14.438 --> 02:09:16.979]  Find us on Rumble, and please sign up.
[02:09:17.019 --> 02:09:21.222]  That helps us find our Locals community, Dark Horse Locals community.
[02:09:21.502 --> 02:09:24.764]  And please follow me on Twitter, at Brett Weinstein.
[02:09:24.984 --> 02:09:25.645]  Brett has one T.
[02:09:26.625 --> 02:09:31.926]  I bet the folks at the university jealous of you and your very successful wife that was the most successful professor there.
[02:09:32.646 --> 02:09:34.967]  If they weren't thinking one-dimensionally, they'd have kept you around.
[02:09:35.667 --> 02:09:38.228]  I bet they're not happy they drove you off the reservation.
[02:09:38.448 --> 02:09:40.968]  Well, they drove almost all the students away, too.
[02:09:40.988 --> 02:09:42.769]  They are struggling to keep the college open.
[02:09:42.789 --> 02:09:43.649]  They might shut down, I heard.
[02:09:45.570 --> 02:09:47.290]  I was expecting it to shut down earlier.
[02:09:47.370 --> 02:09:54.152]  The state infused the college with a lot of cash to keep it running, but they just simply don't have enough students to justify it.
[02:09:54.472 --> 02:09:55.952]  So what happened to the guy that was gunning for you?
[02:09:57.194 --> 02:09:58.996]  Uh, he stepped down.
[02:09:59.456 --> 02:10:01.658]  They literally... So see, he didn't think of that.
[02:10:01.678 --> 02:10:02.759]  It's a Pyrrhic victory.
[02:10:03.139 --> 02:10:04.420]  He got you, but he's gone.
[02:10:04.520 --> 02:10:05.020]  He's gone.
[02:10:05.381 --> 02:10:08.483]  But they, interestingly, they couldn't hire a replacement.
[02:10:08.503 --> 02:10:13.246]  They had to hire somebody from inside the college because literally nobody would take the job after he wrecked the place.
[02:10:14.688 --> 02:10:16.349]  Which is why war isn't good.
[02:10:16.389 --> 02:10:17.990]  People think of war as just military.
[02:10:18.410 --> 02:10:18.611]  No.
[02:10:18.851 --> 02:10:22.494]  War is messing with people for no reason just because he gives you power.
[02:10:22.774 --> 02:10:22.914]  Yeah.
[02:10:24.116 --> 02:10:25.958]  Instead of another university, right?
[02:10:25.998 --> 02:10:26.758]  It'd be even bigger now.
[02:10:27.359 --> 02:10:27.579]  Right.
[02:10:28.380 --> 02:10:41.831]  The degree to which they had a college that was special, and it could have been turned into something amazing and very popular, and instead they destroyed it, it is actually a cautionary tale.
[02:10:41.891 --> 02:10:43.452]  A metaphor for Earth today.
[02:10:43.652 --> 02:10:44.133]  Exactly.
[02:10:44.293 --> 02:11:00.721]   We're going to end this with the video, or the footage, of the great Rod Serling's Planner of the Apes ending scene with the late, great Charlton Heston when he learns he's actually back on Earth and they blew it all up.
[02:11:01.501 --> 02:11:02.802]  Let's not go there.
[02:11:03.262 --> 02:11:04.802]  Doctor, very impressive.
[02:11:05.302 --> 02:11:07.663]  I'm a big fan and I love meeting you in person.
[02:11:07.683 --> 02:11:08.283]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:11:08.583 --> 02:11:08.923]  Thank you.
[02:11:09.683 --> 02:11:10.244]  All right, folks.
[02:11:10.284 --> 02:11:12.504]  Great job of the crew coming in on Super Bowl Sunday.
[02:11:12.524 --> 02:11:15.085]  And wow, more impressed in person.
[02:11:15.385 --> 02:11:16.265]  This guy's awesome.
[02:11:16.325 --> 02:11:18.366]  Anybody saying he's a bad guy, you're just jealous.
[02:11:20.011 --> 02:11:20.491]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:11:20.731 --> 02:11:21.151]  That's true.
[02:11:21.431 --> 02:11:24.272]  Ladies and gentlemen, New Year's 2024 is here.
[02:11:24.512 --> 02:11:32.634]  We've just got six days left for storewide free shipping, double Patriot points and new products and like foundational energy and InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:11:36.055 --> 02:11:41.277]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:11:41.757 --> 02:11:45.978]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[02:11:46.741 --> 02:11:49.424]  Economist, PhD, Kirk Elliott is in studio with us.
[02:11:49.444 --> 02:11:54.911]  Dr. Elliott is a great guy, just does a great job, and our listeners love him.
[02:11:54.931 --> 02:11:55.512]  I love him too.
[02:11:56.011 --> 02:12:01.451]   And so I asked him, he lives in Colorado, to come here when he was on a few weeks ago,
[02:12:01.451 --> 02:12:11.331]   when we can do a Saturday commercial-free broadcast and be able to really, really drill into the deep dive
[02:12:11.331 --> 02:12:15.131]   on what the real economic numbers are versus what Biden's telling us
[02:12:15.131 --> 02:12:18.390]   and what he and other experts believe the trends are and where we're going.
[02:12:18.390 --> 02:12:22.331]   We'll then intersperse it and tie it into all the news and other breaking information
[02:12:22.331 --> 02:12:24.671]  as we go for the next few hours or so.
[02:12:24.671 --> 02:12:32.572]   And then, former Green Beret commander and lawyer and Defense Intelligence Agency operative,
[02:12:32.572 --> 02:12:35.690]  Ivan Reiklin was on yesterday, live in studio.
[02:12:35.833 --> 02:12:38.396]  He was in a toboggan accident with his kids and blew his leg out.
[02:12:38.416 --> 02:12:39.077]  He was in a wheelchair.
[02:12:39.898 --> 02:12:40.699]  He traded punches with me.
[02:12:44.980 --> 02:12:47.161]  We were wargaming, what if they killed Trump?
[02:12:47.661 --> 02:12:48.862]  And that's what you do in the military.
[02:12:48.922 --> 02:12:53.383]  I'm not in the military, but I studied this for 30 years, so I'm in the same, you know, bailiwick.
[02:12:53.403 --> 02:12:54.524]  That's why I come up with info wars.
[02:12:55.464 --> 02:12:57.465]  We were wargaming, what if they killed Trump?
[02:12:58.025 --> 02:13:01.707]  And how it would blow up in their face and how horrible it would be, which will make them not kill him.
[02:13:02.413 --> 02:13:04.213]  And it got picked up out of context.
[02:13:04.213 --> 02:13:07.573]   And I mean, I think this morning I looked around like 5 million views,
[02:13:07.573 --> 02:13:10.212]  different versions of it's probably 10 million now.
[02:13:10.212 --> 02:13:12.733]  Alex Jones wants Trump dead.
[02:13:12.733 --> 02:13:18.612]   And then even some conservatives bought into that because they saw a 30 second clip.
[02:13:19.078 --> 02:13:21.841]  Folks, that is... Okay, Secret Service, come get me.
[02:13:21.901 --> 02:13:22.081]  No.
[02:13:22.341 --> 02:13:28.067]  We were saying you kill Trump like Obi-Wan Kenobi, he gets more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
[02:13:28.348 --> 02:13:29.589]  They shouldn't do that.
[02:13:29.609 --> 02:13:31.551]  And that's been war game.
[02:13:31.591 --> 02:13:35.114]  Just like I could tell them, don't indict Trump a bunch for stuff he didn't do.
[02:13:35.415 --> 02:13:36.496]  It'll make you more popular.
[02:13:36.836 --> 02:13:38.478]  I mean, that's not rocket science, folks.
[02:13:40.888 --> 02:13:42.589]  In the 1970s, they had total control.
[02:13:42.609 --> 02:13:46.112]  This is just culture in Nashville over country music.
[02:13:47.013 --> 02:13:55.419]  And then four or five people, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, a few others, Chris Christopherson, moved to Austin, Texas, and they said, screw you, we're doing our own music.
[02:13:55.859 --> 02:13:57.700]  And it totally changed that whole industry.
[02:13:58.001 --> 02:14:05.026]  And by the mid-1980s, five or six outlaw country artists had a bigger market than all of Nashville.
[02:14:05.306 --> 02:14:06.307]  You're like, well, who cares about that?
[02:14:06.787 --> 02:14:09.229]  Well, it's the same for culture and politics and freedom.
[02:14:09.509 --> 02:14:16.474]  Joe Rogan's the most popular, and Tucker Carlson, and everybody sounds like Alex Jones now because it's the truth.
[02:14:17.174 --> 02:14:21.677]  And Elon Musk sounds like Alex Jones now because it's the truth and it's popular.
[02:14:22.057 --> 02:14:31.964]  So we were explaining that Trump is seen as the outlaw to the system, you know, the Dukes of Hazzard, just some good old boys, doing no harm, but in trouble with the laws since the day they were born.
[02:14:33.320 --> 02:14:37.115]  This isn't some point about, okay, Willie Nelson is a great guy, I've been friends with him for decades.
[02:14:37.898 --> 02:14:38.761]  This is about...
[02:14:40.154 --> 02:14:43.375]  Culturally on something that matters, we're breaking through and we're winning.
[02:14:43.415 --> 02:14:53.437]  It's like something like half the main hit movies now, like 48% I was seeing in a big variety or Hollywood Reporter article a few months ago, is Christian movies.
[02:14:53.937 --> 02:14:56.397]  Hollywood's dying, but Christian movies are exploding.
[02:14:56.437 --> 02:14:59.378]  So we're here saying we're winning the culture war.
[02:14:59.398 --> 02:15:02.358]  It doesn't look like that if you just tune into MSNBC.
[02:15:02.398 --> 02:15:05.059]  So we've got a lot of potential to rebuild things.
[02:15:05.099 --> 02:15:05.999]  We're very close.
[02:15:06.479 --> 02:15:11.361]  So when I give you all this negative information and scary information, it's like a roadmap.
[02:15:12.041 --> 02:15:17.383]  Kind of like you go to the beach one day and it's 50 mile an hour winds, they got red flags up and say, rip tide, don't get in the water.
[02:15:17.623 --> 02:15:19.024]  It's not a negative, scary thing.
[02:15:19.064 --> 02:15:20.685]  It's saying, it's not safe.
[02:15:21.345 --> 02:15:24.206]  People need to know what we're navigating.
[02:15:24.446 --> 02:15:27.327]  So Dr. Kirk Elliott, thank you so much for flying down here.
[02:15:27.847 --> 02:15:29.668]  I'm glad you're only a few hours away by planes.
[02:15:29.688 --> 02:15:30.348]  You can be here.
[02:15:30.849 --> 02:15:31.569]  The listeners love you.
[02:15:32.549 --> 02:15:35.271]  I've just had like a 30 minute prelude to all of this.
[02:15:35.371 --> 02:15:36.211]  Where do you want to start?
[02:15:36.231 --> 02:15:38.152]  Because you've got a lot of preparation.
[02:15:38.192 --> 02:15:40.053]  You sent us a lot of documents.
[02:15:40.914 --> 02:15:43.715]  I love guests like you that really get your preparation together.
[02:15:44.656 --> 02:15:55.883]   Well, there's so much, Alex, and just since the last time that I was here, We talked about bank failures coming and I said, I think we're going to have bank failures 2.0.
[02:15:57.264 --> 02:16:00.066]  So with bank failures 2.0, what did I mean about that?
[02:16:00.426 --> 02:16:06.491]  Well, we're seeing regional bank stocks just getting crushed, absolutely crushed.
[02:16:06.952 --> 02:16:12.436]  So I was doing some research and Zero Hedge did a great article, Alex, about this.
[02:16:12.497 --> 02:16:20.976]   And so if you look at the bank stocks, Azora Bank cratering, falling off a cliff.
[02:16:20.976 --> 02:16:26.697]   Western Alliance Bank Corp, the article says being clubbed like a baby seal.
[02:16:26.697 --> 02:16:27.657]  Oh, my word.
[02:16:27.657 --> 02:16:32.416]   Shares of Zions Bank Corp, Comerica, Webster Financial, they're tumbling.
[02:16:32.416 --> 02:16:38.297]   Citizens Financial, Regions Financial, South State Prosperity Banksters, Schwab.
[02:16:38.297 --> 02:16:39.855]  Schwab.
[02:16:39.532 --> 02:16:41.254]  This is not a regional bank.
[02:16:41.674 --> 02:16:42.115]  Good grief.
[02:16:42.455 --> 02:16:45.338]  So their shares are just crushing.
[02:16:45.778 --> 02:16:47.059]  They're falling off a cliff.
[02:16:47.559 --> 02:16:49.841]  So when you look at that, now what?
[02:16:50.342 --> 02:17:07.435]   So I think what we saw in What we saw with Silicon Valley Bank, Alex, what we saw with Credit Suisse, what we saw with all of those bank failures that we saw last spring, we're starting to see this again.
[02:17:07.715 --> 02:17:11.538]  Now, the reason that this is important is why are they crumbling?
[02:17:11.658 --> 02:17:13.940]  It was in response to the Fed.
[02:17:14.600 --> 02:17:21.264]  So, the Fed has promised, like we talked about on previous shows here, that 2024 was going to be different.
[02:17:21.564 --> 02:17:28.128]  We've had all these rate increases over the last year and a half on interest rates to slow down inflation, and what did they say?
[02:17:28.148 --> 02:17:32.751]  They said 2024, we've basically tackled the inflation problem.
[02:17:33.131 --> 02:17:33.291]  Right?
[02:17:33.311 --> 02:17:36.893]  We're winning this battle, and so we're going to start doing rate reductions.
[02:17:37.113 --> 02:17:40.715]  And that was my, I'm going to get to that later, but I want you to drill the numbers.
[02:17:40.815 --> 02:17:41.856]  Inflation is not conquered.
[02:17:42.739 --> 02:17:53.110]  No, so there's two ways, it's important for the viewer to understand this, there's two reasons why you want to look at inflation.
[02:17:53.551 --> 02:18:03.602]  Inflation can go up because the economy is growing and it can sustain higher prices and people's wages are going up and so therefore retailers can charge more and blah blah blah.
[02:18:04.182 --> 02:18:08.788]  Or, inflation can go up simply because they're printing money like there's no tomorrow.
[02:18:09.248 --> 02:18:15.695]  So, what the Fed and the Biden administration is saying, inflation is good, it means the economy is growing.
[02:18:16.156 --> 02:18:22.063]  I just saw a video of Jerome Powell a couple days ago stating, look, the economy has never been better.
[02:18:22.603 --> 02:18:27.927]  Inflation means that the economy is growing, and you've got jobs that are increasing.
[02:18:28.367 --> 02:18:34.532]  I've got so much... And then Yellen separately went, Americans need to know that prices aren't going down.
[02:18:34.552 --> 02:18:35.573]  So they're kind of double talking.
[02:18:35.873 --> 02:18:48.062]  They're completely double talking, but they're using the definition of inflation that talks about a growing economy, not looking at the definition of inflation that just is simply an increase in the money supply to provide stimulus to everything.
[02:18:48.342 --> 02:18:52.806]   There is no growth in that, and I've got Documents here that prove that.
[02:18:53.306 --> 02:18:54.628]  So what happened?
[02:18:55.208 --> 02:19:05.338]  So last week they decided, hey, we're going to actually just pause interest rates for the fourth time in a row rather than starting to reduce them, which tells us what?
[02:19:05.698 --> 02:19:08.921]  It tells us they know they haven't won this battle against inflation.
[02:19:08.941 --> 02:19:12.265]  And just a month ago they said they were going to lower them to kind of create a stock market run.
[02:19:12.745 --> 02:19:13.085]  Correct.
[02:19:13.725 --> 02:19:17.047]  Because in an election year, they want the stock market to boom.
[02:19:17.387 --> 02:19:25.230]  Now, I still think that they're going to lower interest rates probably once so they can try to save face, Alex, and say, look, we told you we're going to lower them, so we did.
[02:19:25.710 --> 02:19:35.334]  But there's no possible way that I think that we're going to go throughout this year without rate increases because there's problems that they haven't tackled.
[02:19:35.433 --> 02:19:39.433]  Number one is there's more stimulus, more spending.
[02:19:39.433 --> 02:19:43.872]   They're spending like drunken sailors, and we're going to address that.
[02:19:43.872 --> 02:19:49.513]   Number two, the BRICS nations rising up, taking away demand for the US dollar
[02:19:49.513 --> 02:19:56.152]   by trading in their own currencies with 70% of the world's population, part of the BRICS nations now.
[02:19:56.152 --> 02:20:02.673]   So the demand for the petrol dollar is gone, which means there's no capital inflow into America,
[02:20:03.675 --> 02:20:18.427]  When we have debt ceiling, when we have entitlements, when we have Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, Women, Infant, Children programs, food stamps, infrastructure, Department of Defense, everything, there's no inflow of capital, which means they're going to have to print money like there's no tomorrow.
[02:20:18.767 --> 02:20:19.588]  So here's the problem.
[02:20:20.390 --> 02:20:26.375]  We've got they didn't lower rates because they can't because they haven't tackled inflation.
[02:20:26.675 --> 02:20:28.816]  Their policies tell us that that's the case.
[02:20:29.357 --> 02:20:32.119]  So what happened to these regional bank shares?
[02:20:32.539 --> 02:20:33.680]  They start collapsing.
[02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:34.321]  Why?
[02:20:34.781 --> 02:20:39.825]  Because they needed interest rates to come down because they're facing delinquencies.
[02:20:40.245 --> 02:20:43.687]  When you have a series of delinquencies, you go into default.
[02:20:44.027 --> 02:20:46.068]  So people aren't paying off their loans.
[02:20:46.528 --> 02:20:47.688]  This is a problem.
[02:20:47.768 --> 02:20:54.171]  And so what I see coming, and this article was great because there isn't all just regional banks in this.
[02:20:54.732 --> 02:20:56.692]  Schwab, Alex, that's huge.
[02:20:57.213 --> 02:21:00.394]  One of the largest investment firms in the world.
[02:21:00.894 --> 02:21:04.156]  They're on this list of their shares just being clubbed.
[02:21:04.696 --> 02:21:08.557]  Right, and so what's this going to mean to the U.S.
[02:21:08.637 --> 02:21:09.277]  population?
[02:21:09.737 --> 02:21:19.080]  When they see that what should be the safest asset in the world, their bank account, is no longer safe because banks are undercapitalized and possibly going to have another bank run.
[02:21:19.680 --> 02:21:25.461]  What happens to society, the fabric of society, when you start to have bank runs?
[02:21:26.502 --> 02:21:30.343]  And people don't think that... There's major stress, bigger than we had in 2008.
[02:21:31.846 --> 02:21:33.867]  Way more stressed because we have way more debt.
[02:21:34.488 --> 02:21:37.049]  Banks are way more undercapitalized now than they were.
[02:21:37.089 --> 02:21:39.510]  And I know you're going to walk through all this, but just humor me here.
[02:21:40.091 --> 02:21:41.852]  I'm not a rocket scientist, but I've studied history.
[02:21:42.412 --> 02:21:45.494]  When you get the type of inflation, where do you think inflation really is?
[02:21:46.394 --> 02:21:49.676]  And then they're trying to deny it, but it wrecks Americans.
[02:21:49.716 --> 02:21:52.057]  But for poor people in the third world, it's a death sentence.
[02:21:52.077 --> 02:21:52.758]  I mean, what's that going to do?
[02:21:53.595 --> 02:21:58.537]  Well, inflation really impacts people living at the margin.
[02:21:59.158 --> 02:22:09.803]  So when people are living hand-to-mouth, paycheck-to-paycheck, if you lose or miss one to two paychecks and you probably have to file for bankruptcy, these are the people that inflation hits the most.
[02:22:10.203 --> 02:22:14.005]  Most of America is living in that at-the-margin threshold.
[02:22:14.045 --> 02:22:15.825]  I've seen the USA Today article.
[02:22:15.865 --> 02:22:18.747]  67% of Americans are in debt and living paycheck-to-paycheck.
[02:22:19.147 --> 02:22:20.168]  Yeah, two-thirds.
[02:22:20.768 --> 02:22:21.508]  Two-thirds of America.
[02:22:21.548 --> 02:22:32.174]  So when you have this quagmire, you've got rising prices, you've got rising taxes, you've got rising cost of borrowing, that's the kiss of death.
[02:22:32.314 --> 02:22:33.895]  That's a recipe for disaster.
[02:22:34.255 --> 02:22:37.157]  And this is exactly what's happening under Bidenomics.
[02:22:37.557 --> 02:22:51.026]   Now, you also have recession is looming, Alex, because If you hear what Biden is saying, he's saying, we're having a renaissance in manufacturing in America.
[02:22:52.227 --> 02:22:52.907]  A renaissance.
[02:22:53.287 --> 02:22:54.507]  We're creating jobs.
[02:22:54.827 --> 02:22:57.008]  We're booming the economy.
[02:22:57.028 --> 02:22:58.508]  And all I see is homeless people everywhere.
[02:22:59.068 --> 02:22:59.628]  Everywhere.
[02:23:00.069 --> 02:23:01.029]  Absolutely everywhere.
[02:23:01.369 --> 02:23:04.330]  But the numbers don't add up to that.
[02:23:04.690 --> 02:23:05.910]  The reality is not true.
[02:23:05.950 --> 02:23:11.311]   So there's a manufacturing index that talks about Jobs.
[02:23:12.592 --> 02:23:13.613]  I'm going to find it here.
[02:23:13.873 --> 02:23:15.554]  I've got a bunch of stuff.
[02:23:16.174 --> 02:23:18.616]  So what does that index say?
[02:23:19.176 --> 02:23:28.502]  This index says, and it was reported by Peter Schiff, and I love a lot of his stuff, dark ages for the US housing and manufacturing.
[02:23:29.062 --> 02:23:39.496]   So the manufacturing index shows that 18 out of the past 20 months, the index has been negative, meaning manufacturing jobs
[02:23:39.496 --> 02:23:40.456]  have been going away.
[02:23:40.456 --> 02:23:43.415]  18 out of the last 20 months, Alex.
[02:23:43.415 --> 02:23:46.456]   So the real number is they're going straight down. He says they're doing great.
[02:23:46.456 --> 02:23:49.576]   He says they're doing good. And that's a lot of jobs that are being lost.
[02:23:49.576 --> 02:23:53.816]   Manufacturing jobs are the bread and butter to the US economy.
[02:23:54.048 --> 02:23:56.029]  So what happens when people aren't working?
[02:23:56.429 --> 02:23:58.530]  People aren't going to be able to afford to buy houses.
[02:23:58.850 --> 02:24:25.141]   So what we're seeing here is a precursor to recession in the manufacturing jobs, meaning recession in the housing market, and that's going to be amplified, literally an amplified recession, which basically means depression coming, economic depression, When the housing market is going to collapse because rising interest rates means people can't afford to buy their houses and you've got lowering wages.
[02:24:25.282 --> 02:24:42.236]   So do this for me, in the next hour we're going to roll through all the technicals, all the facts, all the graphs you sent me, all the documents, but just as an American citizen, as an economist, somebody that does this for a living, I know we don't know perfectly where it's going to go or what to predict, but This doesn't look well.
[02:24:42.476 --> 02:24:44.097]  I mean, hopefully we get Trump in.
[02:24:44.117 --> 02:24:45.398]  He can do some things to try to turn it around.
[02:24:45.899 --> 02:24:48.220]  But the black rock of the globalists say we're not open for business.
[02:24:48.961 --> 02:24:56.446]  Biden last week just killed liquid natural gas sales from the US, which was our only main export.
[02:24:56.667 --> 02:25:00.610]  I mean, it's like holding our head underwater is what it looks like to me.
[02:25:01.130 --> 02:25:01.730]  Am I wrong?
[02:25:02.051 --> 02:25:04.733]  No, you're 100% right.
[02:25:04.833 --> 02:25:07.635]  I mean, so this... Our one main export he's killing.
[02:25:08.973 --> 02:25:14.638]  Yeah, and to me this reeks of punitive damages on Texas, right?
[02:25:15.058 --> 02:25:16.259]  Well that leaked out of the White House!
[02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:22.024]  Yeah, so WhiteHouse.gov, if you go to the White House you can see their fact sheet.
[02:25:23.626 --> 02:25:24.346]  I've got it right here.
[02:25:25.067 --> 02:25:32.033]  The Biden-Harris administration announced temporary pause on pending approvals of liquefied natural gas exports.
[02:25:32.753 --> 02:25:34.155]  So what does that mean in layman's terms?
[02:25:35.017 --> 02:25:39.180]  He just put economic sanctions on Americans and U.S.
[02:25:39.240 --> 02:25:43.323]  companies to basically harass them.
[02:25:43.343 --> 02:25:45.205]  I don't want to just glaze over this.
[02:25:45.225 --> 02:25:46.465]  I didn't even know that was in your stack.
[02:25:46.505 --> 02:25:47.446]  You gave me a whole other stack here.
[02:25:48.247 --> 02:25:49.868]  The magnitude, folks, let's just dig in.
[02:25:50.388 --> 02:25:53.851]  The lifeblood is fertilizer, food, and energy.
[02:25:54.191 --> 02:25:55.532]  Machines eat energy.
[02:25:55.852 --> 02:25:57.874]  Machines eat gas and oil and coal.
[02:25:58.314 --> 02:26:00.276]  Okay, the windmills are like 10 percent, they're nothing.
[02:26:01.156 --> 02:26:03.878]  And when you do that, that's directly the real economy.
[02:26:04.339 --> 02:26:16.949]  So when you cut off energy sales and you say you can't increase generation at your coal plants in the hot summer or the winter, which they've done, and you were going to ban all your gas ranges, and we're going to, I mean, they're literally, if you want to strike people, that's what you do.
[02:26:16.969 --> 02:26:18.430]  Because that's the real money, right?
[02:26:18.470 --> 02:26:19.491]  That's the real currency.
[02:26:20.191 --> 02:26:33.682]  Yeah, so they basically said in this fact sheet from the White House, it's like, because we want to tackle climate change, we're going to put a temporary pause on pending approvals of liquefied natural gas.
[02:26:34.002 --> 02:26:37.721]  So like you said Alex, what are we good at in America?
[02:26:37.721 --> 02:26:40.921]   We're good at a lot of things, but what we're really, really good at is oil and gas.
[02:26:41.569 --> 02:26:42.230]  We're number one.
[02:26:42.690 --> 02:26:44.052]  And especially in Texas.
[02:26:44.112 --> 02:26:48.998]  It's like you're in a football game with Brady, you know, three, four years ago, he's won the Super Bowl.
[02:26:49.218 --> 02:26:52.021]  And they say, you know, we're going to pull Brady out here at the Super Bowl.
[02:26:52.222 --> 02:26:53.003]  We're going to pull him out.
[02:26:54.344 --> 02:26:56.046]  I mean, that's basically what they're saying.
[02:26:56.427 --> 02:26:57.047]  But here's where...
[02:26:58.149 --> 02:27:01.171]  This is, the timing of this seems really bizarre to me.
[02:27:01.852 --> 02:27:04.894]  Because they've been talking about climate change forever, right?
[02:27:04.914 --> 02:27:13.861]  But so why bring it out a few days after the big border crisis when Texas is going after the feds, and they're all fighting with each other at the border, and so what does Biden say?
[02:27:13.881 --> 02:27:20.266]  He said, hey, we're going to pause exports of LNG, liquefied natural gas, to Asia, to Europe.
[02:27:20.466 --> 02:27:21.927]  So you can't export it anywhere.
[02:27:21.947 --> 02:27:23.649]  So this is an elite fighting itself.
[02:27:24.609 --> 02:27:25.871]  It's absolutely that.
[02:27:26.011 --> 02:27:27.672]  And so what is this going to mean?
[02:27:28.033 --> 02:27:33.938]  To me, what he just did is economic sanctions on Americans for really the first time that I can think of.
[02:27:33.978 --> 02:27:34.859]  That should be the headline.
[02:27:35.199 --> 02:27:43.287]  Instead of sanctions on Iran or Russia or China, they put natural gas sanctions on Putin two years ago.
[02:27:43.547 --> 02:27:46.450]  They literally put the same sanctions on Texas they put on Putin.
[02:27:46.590 --> 02:27:49.451]  Yeah, I mean, you've been following this stuff for decades, Alex.
[02:27:50.272 --> 02:28:00.557]  Usually economic sanctions are basically reserved for political stuff against a rogue terrorist nation, like Iran, like Russia, or whatever.
[02:28:01.097 --> 02:28:02.438]  But on our own people?
[02:28:02.778 --> 02:28:05.039]  Well, this shows where they're going with the social credit scores.
[02:28:05.599 --> 02:28:06.820]  BlackRock's saying we'll control behavior.
[02:28:06.840 --> 02:28:08.621]  They're like, oh, you're not doing what we say?
[02:28:08.701 --> 02:28:10.142]  We'll just cut your main export off.
[02:28:12.010 --> 02:28:13.991]  It's so criminal, it's so ridiculous.
[02:28:14.051 --> 02:28:14.271]  It is.
[02:28:14.311 --> 02:28:19.294]  So imagine, okay, so everything we're talking about is inflation, they're going to have to print more money.
[02:28:19.754 --> 02:28:24.437]  Do you think jobs being lost are going to help matters?
[02:28:24.657 --> 02:28:24.817]  No.
[02:28:25.177 --> 02:28:25.978]  No, of course not.
[02:28:26.018 --> 02:28:27.979]  They can't buy the electric cars now because they have no money.
[02:28:28.439 --> 02:28:29.419]  Correct.
[02:28:29.700 --> 02:28:32.621]  So look at this possible scenario.
[02:28:33.021 --> 02:28:35.923]  So these are millions of jobs that could be lost.
[02:28:36.423 --> 02:28:39.804]  According to a Texas oil and gas consultancy group.
[02:28:40.324 --> 02:28:41.384]  Millions of jobs.
[02:28:41.845 --> 02:28:51.307]  So you have all these people... Because we've cut Russia off, which is like, okay, that'll let the US market... No, he's killed the Russian market, blown up the pipeline to Europe, and is cutting our gas off.
[02:28:51.727 --> 02:28:52.027]  Correct.
[02:28:52.247 --> 02:28:52.567]  Wow!
[02:28:52.728 --> 02:28:55.608]  I mean, that is like, I come to your house and you go, why is the power off?
[02:28:55.628 --> 02:29:03.831]   You walk out in the backyard and some dude's taking a hatchet or a club or a jackhammer To the power input to your house.
[02:29:03.851 --> 02:29:04.791]  You'd kick their ass.
[02:29:05.251 --> 02:29:06.011]  Or you'd call the police.
[02:29:06.051 --> 02:29:06.211]  Right.
[02:29:06.911 --> 02:29:07.091]  Yeah.
[02:29:07.432 --> 02:29:09.112]  So get a load of this.
[02:29:09.172 --> 02:29:12.433]  So if people aren't working, what are they going to do?
[02:29:12.873 --> 02:29:16.994]  First response is they're going to go to the government and say, I need unemployment benefits of some sort.
[02:29:17.514 --> 02:29:18.114]  I need Medicare.
[02:29:18.154 --> 02:29:18.794]  I need Medicaid.
[02:29:18.814 --> 02:29:19.595]  I need food stamps.
[02:29:19.615 --> 02:29:20.495]  So it's cloud and pivot.
[02:29:20.535 --> 02:29:21.235]  Collapse the system.
[02:29:21.415 --> 02:29:22.035]  Yeah.
[02:29:22.395 --> 02:29:24.176]  So they go to the government for help.
[02:29:24.536 --> 02:29:28.397]  And what happens when you have all these manufactured layoffs?
[02:29:28.797 --> 02:29:40.283]  Right, whether it's in manufacturing like we're seeing, oil and gas, tech stocks, tech companies are laying people off hand over fist for a different reason, but yet same result, people aren't working.
[02:29:40.664 --> 02:29:42.345]  So what happens when people don't work?
[02:29:42.645 --> 02:29:45.486]  There's no income tax revenues for the government.
[02:29:45.787 --> 02:29:50.909]  When people don't work, they're not spending money, which means sales tax revenues come down.
[02:29:50.929 --> 02:29:51.810]  So what are they really doing?
[02:29:52.967 --> 02:30:05.380]  Well, they're actually creating a Pandora's box, where people aren't working, they're going to the government for benefits, and the government is losing its revenue streams because people aren't working.
[02:30:05.761 --> 02:30:10.626]  Just like us pushing Russia into war made people join the BRICS, our government is even destroying themselves.
[02:30:11.086 --> 02:30:13.128]  They're destroying themselves, and to what end?
[02:30:14.122 --> 02:30:20.868]  I think if you start connecting the dots, Alex, like you're really, really good at, you start to see what is their endgame.
[02:30:21.529 --> 02:30:29.535]  I think their endgame is to collapse the financial system because then people will look to them and say, hey, this is so broken.
[02:30:30.836 --> 02:30:34.479]  People aren't necessarily going to look at them as the reason why it collapsed.
[02:30:34.499 --> 02:30:36.800]  They're just going to look at something collapse and say, fix it.
[02:30:37.260 --> 02:30:38.161]  We'll give you anything.
[02:30:38.181 --> 02:30:39.061]  We'll give up our freedoms.
[02:30:39.081 --> 02:30:39.642]  We'll give you this.
[02:30:39.662 --> 02:30:40.222]  We'll give you that.
[02:30:40.342 --> 02:30:42.804]  And Klaus Schwab has said, they'll never know we did it.
[02:30:43.264 --> 02:30:43.984]  Build back better.
[02:30:44.024 --> 02:30:44.665]  Great reset.
[02:30:45.005 --> 02:30:46.986]  And then they want to make it so bad, we then go to them.
[02:30:47.646 --> 02:30:47.847]  Yes.
[02:30:48.907 --> 02:30:50.388]  And what's their solution?
[02:30:51.109 --> 02:30:53.050]  What are they going to bring to the table?
[02:30:54.161 --> 02:31:09.171]  This is the biggest thing, I think, of this generation because it's a change in the monetary system globally that has been in place since 1944 in Bretton Woods when the US dollar was the world's reserve currency.
[02:31:09.731 --> 02:31:12.053]  That power has shifted to the East.
[02:31:12.673 --> 02:31:17.917]  World's reserve currency, I believe now, is going to be the BRICS nations.
[02:31:18.337 --> 02:31:19.599]  By the way, this isn't your opinion.
[02:31:20.060 --> 02:31:32.918]  When you read the EU Central Bank, the British Central Bank, the Russian Central Bank, the Chinese Central Bank, the US Central Bank, they all admit the old system's coming to an end and they're positioning for the new and then our own government's doing the perfect thing you do to kill the dollar.
[02:31:33.519 --> 02:31:34.120]  Exactly.
[02:31:35.001 --> 02:31:36.742]  So what are they bringing in?
[02:31:37.142 --> 02:31:38.563]  Central bank digital currency.
[02:31:38.984 --> 02:31:40.425]  Is that going to fix a system?
[02:31:40.465 --> 02:31:41.605]  Does it fix inflation?
[02:31:41.685 --> 02:31:41.845]  No.
[02:31:42.226 --> 02:31:47.389]  It's actually easier to create digital money than it is to create paper money.
[02:31:47.409 --> 02:31:48.149]  But it brings control.
[02:31:48.289 --> 02:31:49.730]  But it brings absolutely control.
[02:31:49.750 --> 02:31:51.491]  This is all about people control.
[02:31:51.852 --> 02:32:06.621]   And if you create a system where everybody is scared, where everybody is fearful, where they can't make their payments, and say, hey, government, we will give up our financial freedom, we'll give up our financial privacy for this, And in result, what do you get?
[02:32:07.281 --> 02:32:09.522]  Spyware in your bank account, literally.
[02:32:10.043 --> 02:32:18.828]  You get ideological-based spending behaviors where they will cut you off from buying or selling if your ideology doesn't match up.
[02:32:18.848 --> 02:32:20.409]  And BlackRock says they're going to do that!
[02:32:20.649 --> 02:32:30.276]  They said, not just BlackRock, World Economic Forum, Bank for International Settlements, the IMF, the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank.
[02:32:30.376 --> 02:32:37.321]  I always wonder why are they so, like they'll lie on the news and say none of this is happening, but if you tune into the UN or the WF, they admit it all.
[02:32:37.341 --> 02:32:42.004]  You'll eat bugs, we're taking your kids, we're going to bankrupt everybody, you're going to limit a 200 square foot of coffin apartment.
[02:32:42.425 --> 02:32:50.291]   Why do they at one level say it's not happening for the general public, but at their meetings, Well, I think so, and why would they actually say these extraordinary things and people not fight back?
[02:32:50.311 --> 02:32:52.512]  Maybe it's because people don't realize that it actually is that bad.
[02:32:52.331 --> 02:32:55.891]   leaders and act confidence game but then for the general public they get well
[02:32:55.891 --> 02:33:01.491]   they're just plebs don't tell them well and I think so and and why would they
[02:33:01.491 --> 02:33:07.850]   actually say these extraordinary things and people not fight back maybe it's
[02:33:07.850 --> 02:33:12.411]   because people don't realize that it actually is that bad maybe they think
[02:33:12.411 --> 02:33:17.170]   ah this could never happen right we're weren't they oh they said five years ago
[02:33:18.012 --> 02:33:26.637]  Now, something like five companies own 80% of the food, and whether it's Tyson chicken or anything, the breading on your chicken now, folks, is cricket protein.
[02:33:26.657 --> 02:33:27.157]  They did it.
[02:33:27.638 --> 02:33:28.678]  You say, oh, y'all never did that?
[02:33:28.778 --> 02:33:29.759]  Oh yeah, you are.
[02:33:31.300 --> 02:33:36.163]  I've caught myself buying stuff, because I shopped some of the groceries, and I'm like, holy crap, that's got bug protein.
[02:33:36.183 --> 02:33:37.184]  It's got little codes on it.
[02:33:37.884 --> 02:33:39.145]  Oh my God, it's just sick.
[02:33:39.991 --> 02:33:40.572]  Do you like bugs?
[02:33:41.893 --> 02:33:44.136]  No, I mean, chitin's very toxic.
[02:33:44.676 --> 02:33:45.738]  Bug protein's not good for you.
[02:33:45.918 --> 02:33:48.100]  Not that I'm a health dev, but I can read.
[02:33:48.160 --> 02:33:48.721]  I mean, it's bad.
[02:33:48.741 --> 02:33:51.324]  My point is, you're absolutely right.
[02:33:51.364 --> 02:33:52.005]  They're doing it.
[02:33:52.425 --> 02:33:53.246]  They are doing it.
[02:33:53.667 --> 02:34:00.574]  And see, sometimes normalcy bias will kill people's portfolios because they... Explain what normalcy bias is.
[02:34:01.135 --> 02:34:06.641]  It means if something hasn't happened to you in the past, it's not going to happen to you in the present or in the future.
[02:34:07.122 --> 02:34:08.323]  People get used to things.
[02:34:08.383 --> 02:34:10.326]  It's like, oh, we've had financial crisis before.
[02:34:10.366 --> 02:34:10.626]  Look at 2000.
[02:34:11.527 --> 02:34:11.787]  Look at 2009.
[02:34:11.867 --> 02:34:13.509]  We recovered.
[02:34:14.611 --> 02:34:19.676]  Look at our loss of freedoms like we had during Patriot Act, for example.
[02:34:21.158 --> 02:34:22.339]  Well, what did that mean?
[02:34:22.379 --> 02:34:24.420]  Well, we're still here, we're still okay.
[02:34:24.720 --> 02:34:28.942]  Some people say, ah, things happen and it's all going to be just fine in the end.
[02:34:29.122 --> 02:34:34.726]  Like, in investing, it's kind of like, you know, buy and hold forever, right?
[02:34:34.786 --> 02:34:36.066]  Things are always going to go up forever.
[02:34:36.146 --> 02:34:37.147]  No, they don't.
[02:34:37.407 --> 02:34:39.168]  In the long haul, sure.
[02:34:39.608 --> 02:34:42.170]  Is the stock market, for example, greater than it was in 2009?
[02:34:43.030 --> 02:34:43.250]  Yep.
[02:34:43.390 --> 02:34:44.451]  Is it bigger than it was in 2007?
[02:34:44.491 --> 02:34:45.832]  But it's following inflation.
[02:34:46.352 --> 02:34:58.517]  It's following inflation and there's a better way to do things because if you have an 80% correction like we saw in 2000 when the tech stocks blew, it took like nine years to recover from that.
[02:34:58.978 --> 02:35:07.061]  Do you think it would be smarter to kind of watch those intermediate trends, buy low, sell high, lock in those profits and then not wait nine years to recover?
[02:35:07.081 --> 02:35:10.223]  Well we know in 2000 and 2008 the globalists got out before too.
[02:35:10.483 --> 02:35:10.663]  Yes.
[02:35:11.263 --> 02:35:11.703]  They did!
[02:35:12.884 --> 02:35:14.684]  So that happened in 2009.
[02:35:15.205 --> 02:35:18.986]  This time, I think it's significantly, fundamentally different.
[02:35:19.386 --> 02:35:21.567]  Because if you look at 2000... You can feel it's the big one.
[02:35:22.427 --> 02:35:24.848]  You just can, because 2000, what was it?
[02:35:24.988 --> 02:35:25.649]  Tech stocks.
[02:35:26.389 --> 02:35:29.890]  It was a sector-based... No, now they're attacking food, energy.
[02:35:29.910 --> 02:35:31.891]  They're deliberately suppressing every sector.
[02:35:32.612 --> 02:35:34.012]  Every, every sector.
[02:35:34.072 --> 02:35:35.453]  And security, defunding police.
[02:35:35.513 --> 02:35:37.393]  I mean, they are really... Borders, wars...
[02:35:39.347 --> 02:35:44.347]  political warfare. All of it. And in 2009 what was that?
[02:35:44.347 --> 02:35:50.347]   That was subprime lending. That was a sector of the total stock market, right?
[02:35:50.347 --> 02:35:57.347]   This time what is this one? This big bubble is a debt-based bubble, which what in our society is funded by debt?
[02:35:57.347 --> 02:36:00.347]  Everything. Alex, the stock market...
[02:36:00.652 --> 02:36:01.193]  I'm going to shut up.
[02:36:01.313 --> 02:36:02.074]  You're making so many great points.
[02:36:02.094 --> 02:36:02.754]  I'm just backing you up.
[02:36:03.215 --> 02:36:04.436]  Doc, speak to this then.
[02:36:04.456 --> 02:36:09.300]  The bubble we're at, why it's the mega bubble, and then also, you're a great sponsor, right?
[02:36:09.340 --> 02:36:10.180]  Youngs and listeners love you.
[02:36:10.200 --> 02:36:10.701]  You're really smart.
[02:36:10.721 --> 02:36:15.985]  I should also say, you've got great gold and silver bullion at great prices, ready to ship to people.
[02:36:16.425 --> 02:36:17.546]  We're so blessed to get you.
[02:36:17.886 --> 02:36:19.528]  And then I'm like, wow, you're a great talk show.
[02:36:19.568 --> 02:36:20.669]  I already knew who you were for years.
[02:36:21.029 --> 02:36:21.910]  Please come in here with us.
[02:36:21.950 --> 02:36:25.473]  But we also need to also get people prepared and support the broadcast, support what you're doing.
[02:36:26.033 --> 02:36:32.256]  Well, thanks for that, but you know, here's... I just love how you've got to be made to plug your company, so... Yeah.
[02:36:32.836 --> 02:36:36.558]  Let's just stop now for a minute and plug your company, and then let's get back into the mega bubble we've hit.
[02:36:36.578 --> 02:36:42.061]  Okay, so before we get to the big bubble, there is a solution for everybody that's watching.
[02:36:42.481 --> 02:36:43.002]  To me, it's...
[02:36:43.922 --> 02:36:45.984]  How do you get away from central bank digital currency?
[02:36:46.304 --> 02:36:49.086]  You don't want to be a digital slave in their digital world.
[02:36:49.286 --> 02:36:51.748]  Tangible assets like gold and silver are perfect for that.
[02:36:52.208 --> 02:36:58.453]  How do you get away from a banking crisis that I believe Banking Crisis 2.0 is coming where banks are going to fail?
[02:36:59.013 --> 02:36:59.814]  Get out of the banks!
[02:36:59.854 --> 02:37:01.075]  Don't have too much money in the banks.
[02:37:01.335 --> 02:37:06.179]  But what do you go into if the stock market's overvalued, if the bonds are getting crushed because interest rates are going up?
[02:37:06.579 --> 02:37:08.521]  Tangible assets like gold and silver.
[02:37:09.282 --> 02:37:17.949]  When you have something that's real, when you have something that's tangible, that you can take delivery of, Alex, this is where safety comes in.
[02:37:18.469 --> 02:37:22.433]  This is actually right now at this time in history where growth comes in.
[02:37:22.853 --> 02:37:25.975]  And when you can have safety and growth at the same time, it's incredible.
[02:37:27.543 --> 02:37:29.124]  Here's a big problem.
[02:37:29.604 --> 02:37:32.825]  Not all gold and silver are created equal.
[02:37:33.005 --> 02:37:39.367]  If you're watching and you say, I've heard gold and silver ads everywhere.
[02:37:39.908 --> 02:37:43.329]  On every single podcast in the Patriot world I've seen gold and silver ads.
[02:37:43.628 --> 02:37:46.308]  Okay, there's only a few things that you should buy.
[02:37:46.308 --> 02:37:47.308]  It's bullion.
[02:37:47.308 --> 02:37:52.508]   So in silver, 100 ounce bars, 10 ounce bars, one ounce silver rounds from the refineries.
[02:37:52.508 --> 02:37:54.828]  In gold, one ounce gold bars or kilo bars.
[02:37:54.828 --> 02:37:55.828]  That's it.
[02:37:55.828 --> 02:38:01.147]   When you have coins, rare stuff, collectible stuff, things with a story, they're always
[02:38:01.147 --> 02:38:02.147]  high premiums.
[02:38:02.147 --> 02:38:09.788]   I mean, I just saw an invoice from another company from a client who showed it to us,
[02:38:09.788 --> 02:38:12.987]  over $900 an ounce for silver.
[02:38:12.987 --> 02:38:16.908]  It should be $28 an ounce for crying out loud.
[02:38:16.908 --> 02:38:20.908]   That's why people ask why I've not had a gold or silver sponsor in a decade.
[02:38:20.908 --> 02:38:26.628]   When Minus Resources got out of the business, who I've been with since 1996.
[02:38:26.642 --> 02:38:27.483]  1996, they were a good company.
[02:38:28.123 --> 02:38:29.264]  I couldn't find any.
[02:38:29.284 --> 02:38:32.405]  They would promise me and say, we're going to sell gold and silver bullion.
[02:38:32.825 --> 02:38:34.526]  We've got a few numismatics people that want those.
[02:38:34.566 --> 02:38:35.927]  That's a secondary pitch.
[02:38:35.987 --> 02:38:41.149]  And then soon as I saw it, I would call and have, and they were pitching me numismatics over price right away.
[02:38:41.169 --> 02:38:41.769]  And I'd say, that's it.
[02:38:42.170 --> 02:38:42.810]  We're not doing this.
[02:38:42.850 --> 02:38:43.510]  That's why it has.
[02:38:43.590 --> 02:38:44.851]  And now the market's exploding.
[02:38:45.411 --> 02:38:52.575]  I literally prayed about a year ago, God, give me a real gold and silver sponsor that just gives them a decent fee to pay your bills.
[02:38:52.615 --> 02:38:53.295]  It gives them a great deal.
[02:38:53.795 --> 02:38:57.077]  And so that's why I love your company, and we're getting great reviews from listeners.
[02:38:57.458 --> 02:39:01.260]  Well, there's two keys to investing, right?
[02:39:01.320 --> 02:39:04.983]  Number one is being in the right place at the right time, and number two, never overpay for your stuff!
[02:39:05.663 --> 02:39:05.763]  Ever!
[02:39:05.844 --> 02:39:09.246]  And then as a seller, you want to do a thousand transactions.
[02:39:09.406 --> 02:39:10.327]  It's like marrying a woman.
[02:39:10.367 --> 02:39:12.428]  You want to love her and take care of her and have a relationship.
[02:39:12.688 --> 02:39:13.649]  That's how I am with my customers.
[02:39:13.729 --> 02:39:15.770]  I don't want to rape them one time, you know?
[02:39:15.850 --> 02:39:17.412]  I mean, it's bullcrap.
[02:39:18.812 --> 02:39:20.493]  Yeah, it is.
[02:39:20.733 --> 02:39:27.537]  Our philosophy as a company is to have a lifetime relationship with our clients, because I'm a relationship kind of guy.
[02:39:27.977 --> 02:39:36.682]  So when we can hold a client's hand through the economy, let them know when it's time to buy, sell, reallocate, get out of dodge, do whatever needs to be done, you have to have something that's liquid.
[02:39:37.322 --> 02:39:40.364]  This is an important key in gold and silver.
[02:39:40.704 --> 02:39:55.600]   Most companies out there, when you look, When you look at their invoices, and if you're out there and you've purchased from them, a lot of them that I'm seeing, $60, $70 an ounce for silver, over $3,000 an ounce for gold.
[02:39:55.920 --> 02:39:57.062]  It's like, are you kidding me?
[02:39:57.803 --> 02:40:01.447]  See, those kind of things, you have to make a market for them.
[02:40:02.068 --> 02:40:02.988]  So what does that mean?
[02:40:03.328 --> 02:40:14.531]  When it's time to buy or sell, and we've all seen this, we've all experienced it, so you'll get a call from a gold and silver dealer and they'll say, hey Jane Doe, have I got a deal for you.
[02:40:14.831 --> 02:40:24.174]  We just found this like old carriage that tipped over in Nevada way back in the day and there's these gold coins from it and boy they're rare and they're amazing and we can get them to you.
[02:40:24.594 --> 02:40:26.295]  But they're not going to last long.
[02:40:26.355 --> 02:40:30.719]  They're going to be gone in 72 hours, so you have to act now and we'll give you 5% off, right?
[02:40:31.159 --> 02:40:32.260]  Something silly like that.
[02:40:32.820 --> 02:40:39.825]  I mean, that means also when you need to liquidate them and lock in profits, the same thing.
[02:40:40.125 --> 02:40:41.787]  They have to make a market for it.
[02:40:41.827 --> 02:40:46.710]  They have to find somebody else that wants to buy those things because there's not a ready-made market for those.
[02:40:47.151 --> 02:40:49.933]  See, when we at our firm, we deal in bullion.
[02:40:50.393 --> 02:40:51.894]  Which is a global commodity.
[02:40:51.934 --> 02:40:53.235]  It's used for manufacturing.
[02:40:53.616 --> 02:41:04.044]  So when we want to lock in a price, we simply call the depository, we lock in the price, and then in a very short period of time, we wire the funds into your account.
[02:41:04.364 --> 02:41:06.886]  But the key is, the transaction is done immediately.
[02:41:07.247 --> 02:41:08.207]  It's automatic.
[02:41:08.968 --> 02:41:09.108]  Right?
[02:41:09.148 --> 02:41:10.449]  Because it's a global commodity.
[02:41:10.489 --> 02:41:11.870]  There's always demand for it.
[02:41:12.250 --> 02:41:27.058]  Whether it's India or China or something where their currencies are out of favor and they need gold or silver or for manufacturing like Sony, Samsung, Tesla, LG, wanting to buy silver for manufacturing, there's always a market for it.
[02:41:27.138 --> 02:41:33.101]  So, key to investing, never buy something you have to make a market for because it could be illiquid.
[02:41:33.621 --> 02:41:36.163]  Always buy something where there's a ready-made market for it.
[02:41:36.223 --> 02:41:41.607]   This is what we focused on For the beginning of our company, I've been doing this since 2002.
[02:41:41.707 --> 02:41:44.470]  That's a long time, Alex.
[02:41:44.490 --> 02:41:47.793]  I've been doing this since 2002.
[02:41:48.234 --> 02:41:55.181]  And I've never seen a client that's actually overcome those high premiums and those things, like ever.
[02:41:55.201 --> 02:41:56.743]  I've been doing this for a long time.
[02:41:57.483 --> 02:41:59.405]  But in bullion, it's more of a...
[02:42:00.366 --> 02:42:09.217]  An immediate answer to when you want to lock in profits, boom, it's done because the market is there globally because it's a manufacturing metal.
[02:42:10.034 --> 02:42:20.081]  Now, if any of you out there watching feel like, oh my word, Dr. Kirk, I think I've been ripped off, send us your invoice.
[02:42:20.621 --> 02:42:22.602]  We'll look at it, and we'll let you know.
[02:42:22.942 --> 02:42:27.766]  Just send it to Ashley at K-E-P-M dot com.
[02:42:27.966 --> 02:42:29.607]  That's Ashley at K-E-P-M.
[02:42:29.627 --> 02:42:31.068]  That's KirkElliottPreciousMetals.com.
[02:42:32.389 --> 02:42:45.415]  And she'll look at it and somebody from my team will call you back and say, we think you were in the wrong place at the wrong time, overcharged, overpriced, and we'll help you kind of try to unwind out of what you think might be a situation where you got ripped off.
[02:42:45.635 --> 02:42:46.635]  I mean, we'll look at it for you.
[02:42:46.655 --> 02:42:47.436]  This is what we do.
[02:42:47.876 --> 02:42:48.656]  Our goal is to help.
[02:42:48.776 --> 02:42:48.996]  Why?
[02:42:49.056 --> 02:43:07.206]   Because we want a lifetime relationship with our clients And so we'll help you take advantage of that situation to get you in the right place at the right time, grow, thrive, and hopefully have your position be something that you envisioned it was going to be from the jump, right?
[02:43:07.246 --> 02:43:07.927]  From the get-go.
[02:43:07.967 --> 02:43:09.508]  You invested in gold and silver.
[02:43:09.568 --> 02:43:09.848]  Why?
[02:43:10.268 --> 02:43:18.813]  Because you wanted to take advantage of the market to go into something that's going to grow, go into something... And just to interrupt you, I'm not an expert like you, but I've been in this almost 30 years.
[02:43:20.146 --> 02:43:30.789]  It's always, oh, a sunken ship was found, and they're selling you the gold for $100, $300, $400 more than it's worth.
[02:43:31.349 --> 02:43:34.170]  Why not just say, hey, we make a percent here to do this for you.
[02:43:34.590 --> 02:43:41.252]  And the key, you said, was because you're selling at the real market price, you can actually get it to them immediately.
[02:43:41.632 --> 02:43:44.593]  And it's more liquid because it's not in the numismatic realm.
[02:43:44.873 --> 02:43:45.553]  It's a commodity.
[02:43:45.933 --> 02:43:46.133]  Right.
[02:43:46.454 --> 02:43:47.674]  And so that's why it's so important.
[02:43:48.194 --> 02:43:54.677]  Well, that's why you can't just go sell some numismatic you got, and why you almost never get the money you paid for it, because it's a scam, folks.
[02:43:55.217 --> 02:44:04.841]  Sure, there are some collector coins that are great, and the ones I would promote would be where, oh, there's a 10% markup because this is rare and numismatic, and I checked the market and knew people really could go sell it for that.
[02:44:05.341 --> 02:44:05.601]  Okay?
[02:44:05.961 --> 02:44:08.282]  And then I'm like, and by the way, folks, we're making 5% to fund ourselves.
[02:44:08.522 --> 02:44:09.142]  Just be honest.
[02:44:09.302 --> 02:44:13.564]  People know we got to run this place, do all this stuff, but at the same time, we want to get them a good deal.
[02:44:14.204 --> 02:44:17.526]  I want to buy, I want to sell gold and silver to people from where I buy it.
[02:44:18.146 --> 02:44:18.726]  It's real simple.
[02:44:19.246 --> 02:44:19.806]  That's what I do.
[02:44:19.846 --> 02:44:24.047]  And I've not, the industry, I'll be honest, is so freaking corrupt like everything else.
[02:44:24.728 --> 02:44:28.088]  I have not even been able to have a sponsor for 10 years, people.
[02:44:28.708 --> 02:44:35.370]  We've had five different ones we did deals with and I would promote them for one week and then you would hear the brakes slam on because I don't need that in my life.
[02:44:35.390 --> 02:44:36.310]  It's like Tony Montana.
[02:44:36.530 --> 02:44:46.176]   It's a fictional movie based on a composite for stories written by a Great Oliver Stone, and it was a real case of something similar happening, where the guy would kill women and men.
[02:44:46.196 --> 02:44:47.096]  He wouldn't kill women and children.
[02:44:47.397 --> 02:44:51.520]  And at the end, they wanted to blow up a car full of little kids, and he says, I don't need that in my life.
[02:44:51.720 --> 02:44:53.241]  I am not going to have that in my life.
[02:44:53.622 --> 02:44:56.444]  I want you to get a great deal, and everybody should get gold and silver.
[02:44:56.824 --> 02:44:59.226]  It's one of the surest bets out there, and you guys have a great company.
[02:45:00.547 --> 02:45:01.748]  How does it work if somebody calls you guys?
[02:45:01.768 --> 02:45:05.831]  I don't want to get back into the news, the economy, and I know, I digress, but I'm making you plug your company.
[02:45:06.251 --> 02:45:07.933]  If you get in here and you're a sponsor, you don't even do it.
[02:45:09.328 --> 02:45:12.129]  You did a damn good job once I made you do it!
[02:45:12.149 --> 02:45:13.570]  My goal is to help people, right?
[02:45:13.590 --> 02:45:15.511]  And so news is part of that.
[02:45:15.592 --> 02:45:17.493]  But it's simple.
[02:45:17.893 --> 02:45:24.297]  You just go to KEPM.com forward slash gold, fill out a little form and say, I heard Kirk and Alex talking.
[02:45:24.337 --> 02:45:25.798]  It's like, that made a lot of sense.
[02:45:26.478 --> 02:45:28.120]  And you just put in some of your information.
[02:45:28.260 --> 02:45:34.224]   One of my team, I've got a bajillion schedulers, not a bajillion, like 20, I don't
[02:45:34.224 --> 02:45:34.744]  know.
[02:45:34.744 --> 02:45:38.343]  We have a lot of staff to make sure that your needs are met.
[02:45:38.343 --> 02:45:42.343]   So you'll answer some questions like, "What was it that caused you to want to reach out?
[02:45:42.343 --> 02:45:44.144]  What are you trying to accomplish?
[02:45:44.144 --> 02:45:45.144]  What are your goals?
[02:45:45.144 --> 02:45:46.144]  What are your dreams?
[02:45:46.144 --> 02:45:47.143]  What are your fears?"
[02:45:47.143 --> 02:45:51.664]   We listen to you and then we will get you scheduled with one of our consultants where
[02:45:51.664 --> 02:45:57.024]   we'll map out a strategy for success moving forward using precious metals, bullion, gold
[02:45:57.024 --> 02:45:58.783]  and silver, none of this high-grade stuff.
[02:45:58.894 --> 02:46:10.821]  And like I talked about, if you have some of those high-grade collectible pieces of junk, which they are, well then we can help you unwind that most of the time and get you into a place of prosperity.
[02:46:12.742 --> 02:46:15.584]  The best deal, and sometimes the damage is done.
[02:46:15.964 --> 02:46:24.247]  I mean, I talked to an 80-year-old lady once who, she's way too old, unsuitable transaction, paid over $70,000 an ounce for a piece of gold.
[02:46:24.367 --> 02:46:25.128]  It's like, what?
[02:46:26.128 --> 02:46:28.909]  How in the world are you ever going to get out of this, right?
[02:46:29.310 --> 02:46:31.170]  But most people aren't to that extreme.
[02:46:31.691 --> 02:46:32.571]  They aren't to that extreme.
[02:46:33.031 --> 02:46:34.192]  But with you, it's simple.
[02:46:34.232 --> 02:46:36.773]  They can look at the spot gold and call you up, and wow, it's that.
[02:46:37.293 --> 02:46:38.573]  Yeah, and this is what we do.
[02:46:38.593 --> 02:46:45.395]  Whether you have an IRA, a non-IRA, you want to take delivery of it at home or have it stored because you don't feel safe with it at home.
[02:46:45.736 --> 02:46:51.317]  What we're talking about is a physical asset, though, not paper, not a paper proxy, not an ETF, not any of that.
[02:46:51.577 --> 02:46:53.158]  And by the way, the work is all on your side.
[02:46:53.178 --> 02:46:55.258]  That's why these other companies, too, want to make the quick buck.
[02:46:55.298 --> 02:46:55.999]  They're also lazy.
[02:46:56.019 --> 02:46:57.139]  There's a lot of work that goes into what you do.
[02:46:57.779 --> 02:47:01.340]  A lot, but the client isn't going to see.
[02:47:01.540 --> 02:47:02.801]  They're not going to see any of that.
[02:47:03.201 --> 02:47:06.342]  We want to make the transition easy and the burden light.
[02:47:06.702 --> 02:47:10.623]  Now you have to fill out a couple forms, right, to move the assets from one IRA to another.
[02:47:10.983 --> 02:47:14.984]  But my team will do all of the heavy lifting, the light lifting, and the lifting in between.
[02:47:15.385 --> 02:47:19.746]  But when it's done, when that's done and the funds are moved... Then it gets way easier.
[02:47:20.206 --> 02:47:22.107]  Well, this is where our relationship begins.
[02:47:22.548 --> 02:47:23.888]  That's not the end of the story.
[02:47:23.908 --> 02:47:29.752]  From that point, we want to hold your hand through the economy, and we'll let you know when it's time to buy, sell, reallocate.
[02:47:29.792 --> 02:47:31.113]  Get out of silver, go into gold.
[02:47:31.153 --> 02:47:32.213]  Get out of gold, go into silver.
[02:47:32.233 --> 02:47:33.374]  Right now, you're saying silver.
[02:47:33.834 --> 02:47:34.715]  Right now, it's silver.
[02:47:35.375 --> 02:47:38.457]  Massively, 100% pointed into silver.
[02:47:38.937 --> 02:47:39.838]  I'm not in gold yet.
[02:47:39.858 --> 02:47:41.178]  It's not that I dislike gold.
[02:47:41.479 --> 02:47:41.999]  I love it.
[02:47:42.479 --> 02:47:43.680]  But silver's outperforming.
[02:47:43.700 --> 02:47:44.661]  It's just so much more bullish.
[02:47:45.141 --> 02:47:47.902]  It is because it's manufacturing again.
[02:47:48.063 --> 02:47:50.204]  It's used way more in construction, right, or manufacturing?
[02:47:50.264 --> 02:47:52.905]  In manufacturing, I mean, it's used in electronics.
[02:47:53.506 --> 02:47:55.447]  It's used in fuel cell technology.
[02:47:55.507 --> 02:47:56.468]  It's used in solar.
[02:47:57.188 --> 02:48:05.058]  You know, this is where we can take some of the globalist green agenda and say, all right, what do they need for their EV and their solar stuff?
[02:48:05.078 --> 02:48:06.720]  And let's be honest, that is what we're doing.
[02:48:06.760 --> 02:48:08.802]  Like, I don't go by defense stocks, that'll be part of the murder.
[02:48:09.163 --> 02:48:12.487]  But when it comes to silver, this is being put into everything, so why not follow the trend?
[02:48:13.387 --> 02:48:13.928]  We might as well.
[02:48:13.948 --> 02:48:16.430]  I mean, we want to be wise stewards of what God's given us.
[02:48:16.470 --> 02:48:24.477]  We want to buy low, sell high, be wise, have discernment, and sometimes it just means thinking outside the box.
[02:48:24.597 --> 02:48:35.526]  What I like about you is you never say, oh, gold could go to 10,000 ounces or silver to, you know, 500, but gut level, just as a private person, man to man, with this inflation, it's not going, it's going to get worse.
[02:48:35.866 --> 02:48:37.728]  How high do you think gold and silver are in like two years?
[02:48:38.829 --> 02:48:39.830]  Well, it's pure speculation.
[02:48:40.407 --> 02:48:52.238]  Yeah, I mean I'm not God and I don't control the markets, but when you look at what silver did in 2011, 2010-2011, it went from $12 an ounce to $48 an ounce in like a summer and a fall.
[02:48:52.318 --> 02:48:55.521]  I mean it was, that's like what, 400% growth during that time?
[02:48:56.121 --> 02:48:59.122]  So, similar fundamentals to what we're seeing today.
[02:48:59.562 --> 02:49:05.323]  Unsustainable debt, inflationary pressures, political chaos, geopolitical conflict, low inventory at the COMEX.
[02:49:05.924 --> 02:49:07.484]  So, similar things.
[02:49:07.844 --> 02:49:10.225]  You follow that historical trend.
[02:49:10.245 --> 02:49:11.345]  The same climate.
[02:49:11.405 --> 02:49:13.866]  The same climate and we're starting at 20, let's call it 25.
[02:49:13.946 --> 02:49:16.787]  Well that should bring it to 75 to 100 in pretty short order.
[02:49:18.607 --> 02:49:28.134]  Now, there's economists out there who are saying, well, with absence of manipulation, you should see silver at $600 to $2,500 an ounce.
[02:49:28.234 --> 02:49:31.937]  It's like, okay, how do they come up with that number?
[02:49:32.697 --> 02:49:36.100]  So, when you look at demand, this is just how the markets work.
[02:49:36.140 --> 02:49:37.341]  This is how business works.
[02:49:38.141 --> 02:49:46.343]  So let's say that silver is extinguished at the COMEX depositories and you're Sony, Samsung, Tesla, one of the big manufacturers that need it.
[02:49:46.964 --> 02:49:54.466]  And you have a small amount of silver in every LCD TV, every electric vehicle, whatever you're selling that has electronics in it.
[02:49:54.905 --> 02:49:58.905]   Do you care what the price of silver is if you need it to finish the car?
[02:49:58.905 --> 02:49:59.905]  No, you'll pay whatever you need.
[02:49:59.905 --> 02:50:00.905]  You'll pay whatever you need.
[02:50:00.905 --> 02:50:03.705]   And this is where I'm not concerned about silver running out.
[02:50:03.705 --> 02:50:06.025]   People say, "Kirk, if silver runs out, is this going to be bad for us?"
[02:50:06.025 --> 02:50:08.905]  It's like, no, this is going to be great for us.
[02:50:08.905 --> 02:50:09.905]  Obviously.
[02:50:09.905 --> 02:50:12.905]   Because when silver runs out, which is running desperately low.
[02:50:12.928 --> 02:50:13.909]  People are worried it's going to run out.
[02:50:13.949 --> 02:50:14.930]  That's going to make it explode.
[02:50:15.150 --> 02:50:15.930]  It'll make it explode.
[02:50:15.950 --> 02:50:17.191]  Not hard of supply and demand, folks.
[02:50:17.231 --> 02:50:21.673]  Because, yeah, let's say that you're Tesla and you say, well, silver is $25 an ounce.
[02:50:21.693 --> 02:50:22.054]  We need it.
[02:50:22.094 --> 02:50:22.674]  We can't get it.
[02:50:22.714 --> 02:50:23.154]  We'll offer $40.
[02:50:23.314 --> 02:50:24.475]  Or we'll offer $80.
[02:50:25.235 --> 02:50:25.636]  Or we'll offer $120.
[02:50:26.076 --> 02:50:29.098]  They don't care because they're going to pass that on to the consumer.
[02:50:29.838 --> 02:50:36.721]  Right, so this is where when you own what they need, and it starts to run out, which it is starting to run out.
[02:50:36.741 --> 02:50:38.182]  I can also read the news myself.
[02:50:38.622 --> 02:50:43.365]  Universities, institutions, investors, governments are hoarding the living hell out of it.
[02:50:43.845 --> 02:50:47.587]  They're buying it up as fast as they can, and gold too, so they're also going crazy for gold.
[02:50:47.867 --> 02:50:51.489]  The central banks are going after gold like there's no tomorrow.
[02:50:51.889 --> 02:51:05.177]  So they may poo-poo gold and silver and say, oh, you want central bank digital currency, you want our paper version, we can use interest rates, we can use money creation monetary policy to stimulate the economy, slow it down, do this and that, and we're really good at it.
[02:51:05.258 --> 02:51:14.364]   No, you've proven over the decades that you're horrible at it and you create boom and bust cycles and you have these inflationary pressures and And what are the big central banks doing?
[02:51:14.183 --> 02:51:15.183]  They're riding it up and down.
[02:51:15.183 --> 02:51:16.183]  Yeah.
[02:51:16.183 --> 02:51:17.183]  And so, so what are...
[02:51:17.183 --> 02:51:18.463]  They don't want prosperity for their own people.
[02:51:18.463 --> 02:51:19.463]  No, they don't.
[02:51:19.463 --> 02:51:21.304]  And what are the big central banks doing?
[02:51:21.304 --> 02:51:25.583]   They're buying gold not by the ounce or by the pound or by the ton, but literally, Alex,
[02:51:25.583 --> 02:51:28.942]  by the hundreds or thousands of tons at a time.
[02:51:28.942 --> 02:51:31.063]   Yeah, they're running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
[02:51:31.481 --> 02:51:35.564]  The Chinese Central Bank has over 5,000 tons of gold.
[02:51:36.344 --> 02:51:39.786]  The European Central Bank has over 10,500 tons of gold.
[02:51:40.126 --> 02:51:42.788]  The Fed has over 8,500 tons of gold.
[02:51:42.888 --> 02:51:44.830]  Russia has over 1,000 tons of gold.
[02:51:45.330 --> 02:51:47.391]  India has over 600 tons of gold.
[02:51:47.471 --> 02:51:50.053]  But even universities like UT are secretly buying it.
[02:51:50.093 --> 02:51:50.453]  It's come out.
[02:51:51.994 --> 02:51:59.004]  Most, if not all, of their endowment fund is in gold, stored at the vault that the state of Texas built near Dallas.
[02:51:59.024 --> 02:51:59.805]  It's like, wow!
[02:52:00.145 --> 02:52:02.108]  So what does that tell us?
[02:52:02.168 --> 02:52:08.276]  Why is UT, one of the most powerful universities in the world, if not probably the biggest, what are they completely in gold for?
[02:52:09.104 --> 02:52:10.505]  Well, they're probably not stupid, folks.
[02:52:11.066 --> 02:52:12.907]  No, they've got a bunch of professors there, right?
[02:52:12.967 --> 02:52:19.372]  And a bunch of wealthy people who understand that our global economic system is failing.
[02:52:19.392 --> 02:52:20.734]  Well, the Chinese are doing it, right?
[02:52:20.754 --> 02:52:21.154]  I interrupted.
[02:52:21.194 --> 02:52:21.394]  Go ahead.
[02:52:21.574 --> 02:52:22.835]  No, the Chinese are doing it, too.
[02:52:22.875 --> 02:52:25.137]  So you said global financial system failing.
[02:52:25.257 --> 02:52:25.638]  I interrupted.
[02:52:25.658 --> 02:52:25.878]  Go ahead.
[02:52:25.998 --> 02:52:27.679]  No, global financial system failing.
[02:52:28.860 --> 02:52:31.323]  So here's where, what are they saying?
[02:52:31.443 --> 02:52:32.944]  Don't listen to what they say.
[02:52:33.565 --> 02:52:34.546]  Watch what they do.
[02:52:34.606 --> 02:52:38.991]  I mean, you are so good at that, Alex, of telling all this news that you've got on your desk.
[02:52:39.011 --> 02:52:40.532]  It's like, don't listen to what they say.
[02:52:40.672 --> 02:52:41.453]  Watch what they do.
[02:52:41.553 --> 02:52:43.235]  Because actions speak louder than words.
[02:52:43.615 --> 02:52:48.355]   So when they're buying gold by the thousands of tons, What does that tell us?
[02:52:48.375 --> 02:52:49.437]  They think it's going to go up.
[02:52:49.457 --> 02:52:53.002]  But you're pitching me silver, which I get is the one that's going to have the biggest growth rate.
[02:52:53.263 --> 02:52:54.945]  Why are the elites obsessed with gold?
[02:52:54.965 --> 02:53:03.238]  They're getting silver too, but why are they just... Because you can't really back a currency with silver because it's not high enough cost per ounce.
[02:53:03.678 --> 02:53:04.359]  Gold, gold.
[02:53:04.739 --> 02:53:07.002]  So they're betting on a new system that's going to be gold.
[02:53:07.282 --> 02:53:07.442]  Yeah.
[02:53:07.762 --> 02:53:10.345]  But here's where I want more gold down the road.
[02:53:10.385 --> 02:53:14.249]  So if we leverage silver right now because it's outperforming.
[02:53:14.269 --> 02:53:15.030]  You get the money for gold.
[02:53:15.791 --> 02:53:16.531]  So here's the thing.
[02:53:16.571 --> 02:53:19.835]  Let's say here's our strategy that we implement with all of our clients.
[02:53:20.315 --> 02:53:22.417]  We go into silver now because it's outperforming.
[02:53:22.477 --> 02:53:28.377]   Let's say that over the next 18 to 24 months, silver triples the rate of growth of gold.
[02:53:28.377 --> 02:53:29.377]  What would I do?
[02:53:29.377 --> 02:53:32.857]   I would sell my silver and if it tripled the rate of growth of gold and we go into gold,
[02:53:32.857 --> 02:53:37.177]   I just got you three times as many ounces of gold then as what I could afford.
[02:53:37.177 --> 02:53:41.417]   And then we ride up gold and then once gold peaks we could go back into silver, go into
[02:53:41.417 --> 02:53:42.577]  something different.
[02:53:42.577 --> 02:53:44.137]  Our goal is to make sure you're in the right spot.
[02:53:44.137 --> 02:53:45.137]  Exactly.
[02:53:45.137 --> 02:53:46.816]  Are there any other metals you think are really important?
[02:53:47.721 --> 02:53:48.682]  Those two big guys.
[02:53:48.862 --> 02:53:49.602]  Yeah, just those two.
[02:53:49.622 --> 02:53:51.762]  They're the bread and butter because they have high volume.
[02:53:51.782 --> 02:53:52.783]  There's a lot of trading.
[02:53:53.023 --> 02:53:54.063]  They're the meat and potatoes.
[02:53:54.323 --> 02:53:55.784]  Now people say, well, what about platinum?
[02:53:55.804 --> 02:53:56.624]  What about palladium?
[02:53:56.644 --> 02:53:57.384]  What about rhodium?
[02:53:57.404 --> 02:54:02.625]  It's like, eh, too much thinly traded markets controlled by Russia and South Africa.
[02:54:02.665 --> 02:54:03.126]  Too rigged.
[02:54:03.186 --> 02:54:03.726]  Too risky.
[02:54:03.986 --> 02:54:04.766]  Way too risky.
[02:54:05.086 --> 02:54:09.347]  Well, China, how did China get positioned for 97% control of rare earth minerals?
[02:54:09.507 --> 02:54:11.428]  Because I would say that'd be a great investment, but it's all control.
[02:54:12.338 --> 02:54:23.584]  You never want to invest in anything that's controlled, because you are out of the equation at that point, and logic gets kicked out the window, which is why I like those markets of gold and silver.
[02:54:23.624 --> 02:54:26.245]  Now, here's something really cool, Alex, about silver.
[02:54:26.064 --> 02:54:29.064]   I'm going to shut up now. Go through the rest of your documents.
[02:54:29.064 --> 02:54:34.064]   Yeah, about silver. So we talked about this briefly yesterday.
[02:54:34.064 --> 02:54:38.064]   But there was this article from Dystopia to Utopia and Gold and Silver.
[02:54:38.911 --> 02:54:42.973]  So this is why one of the reasons why we're in silver right now.
[02:54:43.053 --> 02:54:45.193]  So there's been massive manipulation.
[02:54:45.813 --> 02:54:48.534]  All of your viewers are saying the banks are manipulating everything.
[02:54:48.614 --> 02:54:50.815]  BlackRock is, you know, the big hedge funds.
[02:54:50.855 --> 02:54:51.815]  Yes, they have been.
[02:54:52.416 --> 02:54:53.616]  I'm not discounting that.
[02:54:54.016 --> 02:54:56.277]  But you look at where silver has been.
[02:54:56.997 --> 02:54:57.478]  Since the year 2000.
[02:54:57.518 --> 02:54:59.079]  2000 it was like $4.60 an ounce, give or take.
[02:54:59.099 --> 02:55:00.060]  Three and a half years ago it was $11.91.
[02:55:00.181 --> 02:55:01.061]  Fifteen months ago it was $17.97.
[02:55:01.122 --> 02:55:01.542]  Today it's over $23.
[02:55:02.023 --> 02:55:03.704]  So $17.97 to $23, that's up over 30% in the last year, year and a half.
[02:55:03.543 --> 02:55:09.584]  it was 1191, 15 months ago it was 1797, today it's over 23.
[02:55:09.584 --> 02:55:15.863]   So 1797 to 23, that's up over 30% in the last year, year and a half.
[02:55:15.863 --> 02:55:17.143]  What else is performing like that?
[02:55:17.920 --> 02:55:24.989]  You look at what it's done since the last three and a half years, from 1191 to 23, that's almost doubling, up like 100%.
[02:55:26.151 --> 02:55:27.793]  That's averaging over 30% a year.
[02:55:28.173 --> 02:55:32.759]  But it's up over 500% from the year 2000, and people say, well, it's over.
[02:55:32.779 --> 02:55:33.380]  It's risky.
[02:55:33.721 --> 02:55:34.962]  The numbers don't prove that.
[02:55:35.002 --> 02:55:35.543]  That's gaslighting.
[02:55:35.643 --> 02:55:39.328]  Yeah, so here's where those numbers are amazing.
[02:55:39.628 --> 02:55:41.371]  People would like those numbers, right?
[02:55:41.491 --> 02:55:47.639]  So you look at what these charts are doing and silver being manipulated.
[02:55:47.760 --> 02:55:50.644]  These prices reflect manipulated silver.
[02:55:51.044 --> 02:55:52.525]  So this is even a suppressed market?
[02:55:52.665 --> 02:55:53.546]  This is a suppressed market.
[02:55:53.566 --> 02:55:54.627]  Explain how to use negative shorting.
[02:55:54.907 --> 02:56:19.805]  Okay, so manipulation comes when BlackRock, for example, who owns the SLV, which is the silver ETF, they'll go to JPMorgan Chase, which is the custodian of the physical silver that's supposedly backing the ETF, and they say, hey Chase, we just sold 10 million shares of our ETF, we need you to buy 10 million ounces, or whatever, however the mechanics work.
[02:56:20.365 --> 02:56:22.886]  So what is JPMorgan Chase going to do?
[02:56:23.306 --> 02:56:28.588]  They're going to say, let's drive the price down if we have to buy all these ounces, because we want to buy low.
[02:56:28.608 --> 02:56:29.388]  We don't want to buy high.
[02:56:29.428 --> 02:56:32.649]  And they have the ability to do it by shorting the market.
[02:56:32.709 --> 02:56:36.610]  So you issue naked shorts, which means you can short something that you don't own.
[02:56:36.910 --> 02:56:39.571]  Illegal for you and I to do that, but not for big banks.
[02:56:39.951 --> 02:56:41.071]  So they drive the price down.
[02:56:41.211 --> 02:56:42.492]  They gobble up physical silver.
[02:56:42.952 --> 02:56:47.675]  That demand causes the price to go up, and they say, oh, the price is too high, let's issue more short contracts.
[02:56:47.935 --> 02:56:49.256]  They buy up more physical silver.
[02:56:49.276 --> 02:56:51.097]  The demand causes the price to go up.
[02:56:51.457 --> 02:56:53.478]  This has been going on and on and on and on for a long time.
[02:56:53.498 --> 02:56:55.499]  Because of inflation, they're losing their control.
[02:56:55.519 --> 02:56:57.581]  They're losing their control.
[02:56:57.621 --> 02:56:59.602]  They're absolutely losing their control.
[02:57:00.122 --> 02:57:02.784]  And so now, what did they do two weeks ago?
[02:57:03.264 --> 02:57:07.166]   This is, I think, the most important story in silver Ever!
[02:57:07.386 --> 02:57:08.928]  I mean, I've been doing this for decades, Alex.
[02:57:08.948 --> 02:57:11.009]  This is the most important thing for silver.
[02:57:11.510 --> 02:57:12.670]  Bullish activity ever.
[02:57:12.750 --> 02:57:22.718]  So, in one week, in seven days, 50% of all the net short positions globally were unraveled.
[02:57:23.018 --> 02:57:23.939]  They went away.
[02:57:24.059 --> 02:57:25.020]  They're extinguished, right?
[02:57:25.320 --> 02:57:27.641]  This is according to the report by Sprott Money.
[02:57:28.142 --> 02:57:29.483]  So, what does that mean?
[02:57:29.663 --> 02:57:30.003]  Why?
[02:57:30.183 --> 02:57:30.844]  What happened?
[02:57:30.864 --> 02:57:31.504]  Slow down here.
[02:57:31.644 --> 02:57:32.605]  I'm going to stop.
[02:57:33.206 --> 02:57:35.507]  You said this briefly yesterday, but let's just slow down.
[02:57:36.590 --> 02:57:38.272]  I do this too, it's so big we just throw it out there.
[02:57:39.273 --> 02:57:42.297]  Record levels of them killing their shorts.
[02:57:43.538 --> 02:57:46.441]  Explain that slowly because we're not all economists like you.
[02:57:47.042 --> 02:57:48.744]  Doc, explain this, how big this is.
[02:57:49.104 --> 02:57:57.314]  Okay, so if you have a short position active, you make money and a lot of money if the price continues to go down.
[02:57:58.402 --> 02:58:03.686]  If the price of whatever you have a short position on goes up, you lose money hand over fist.
[02:58:04.066 --> 02:58:06.448]  And it's not just a dollar for dollar loss.
[02:58:07.273 --> 02:58:08.234]  It's leveraged.
[02:58:08.634 --> 02:58:18.862]  So when you have a leveraged loss and you've got all of these, I mean literally, a global market with all these short positions, what are they expecting?
[02:58:19.322 --> 02:58:21.443]  They're expecting silver to go through the roof.
[02:58:21.864 --> 02:58:22.564]  How do I know?
[02:58:22.905 --> 02:58:31.551]  Because 50%, 5-0% of all short positions were unwound in a one week span, just a couple weeks ago.
[02:58:32.191 --> 02:58:35.294]  So that tells me they think that silver is going to go through the roof.
[02:58:35.874 --> 02:58:41.996]  Because they have to get rid of their short positions because if they don't, they're going to lose so much money that you couldn't even comprehend it.
[02:58:42.537 --> 02:58:46.518]  So this to me is the biggest news in the silver market ever!
[02:58:46.958 --> 02:58:47.719]  Literally ever!
[02:58:48.159 --> 02:58:49.640]  And what happened last week?
[02:58:50.040 --> 02:58:50.980]  So silver was like at $22.13.
[02:58:51.100 --> 02:58:51.860]  Today it's up over $23.20-ish.
[02:58:51.880 --> 02:58:53.441]  It went up over a dollar in one week.
[02:58:53.260 --> 02:58:56.179]  Today it's up over 2320-ish.
[02:58:56.179 --> 02:58:57.820]  It went up over a dollar in one week.
[02:58:57.820 --> 02:59:01.420]  That's almost a 5% move in one week.
[02:59:01.420 --> 02:59:04.140]  So multiply that out for a year.
[02:59:04.140 --> 02:59:06.460]  That's over a 200% gain for a year.
[02:59:06.460 --> 02:59:10.540]  This is the trend, the pace that we are on.
[02:59:10.540 --> 02:59:13.260]  So what do they know that we don't know?
[02:59:13.260 --> 02:59:17.779]   Why did they unravel their short positions to such a large amount so quickly?
[02:59:18.476 --> 02:59:28.741]  It's because everything that we're adding up here, the inflationary pressures, the Fed basically saying that we can't lower interest rates yet.
[02:59:28.781 --> 02:59:37.745]  We're going to have to pause because coming down the road, we know that inflation is coming and we're going to have to keep raising interest rates to keep slowing down inflation.
[02:59:38.066 --> 02:59:39.826]  But they know that they haven't tackled inflation.
[02:59:39.846 --> 02:59:41.467]  They couldn't lower interest rates yet.
[02:59:41.807 --> 02:59:46.930]  They had to pause them and keep them the same, which is what they've done the last four policy meetings.
[02:59:47.250 --> 02:59:48.351]  They've kept them the same.
[02:59:48.731 --> 02:59:53.135]  So interest rates are going to have to climb to slow down inflation, right?
[02:59:53.435 --> 02:59:54.476]  So what does that tell us?
[02:59:54.616 --> 02:59:55.937]  Inflation is coming.
[02:59:56.277 --> 02:59:59.960]  What happens to tangible assets like gold and silver during inflation?
[03:00:00.281 --> 03:00:02.382]  They go up because they're things.
[03:00:02.763 --> 03:00:04.084]  Things go up with inflation.
[03:00:04.144 --> 03:00:05.164]  I don't care if it's a car.
[03:00:05.445 --> 03:00:06.606]  I don't care if it's oil and gas.
[03:00:06.746 --> 03:00:07.967]  I don't care if it's groceries.
[03:00:08.487 --> 03:00:11.670]  Everybody watching this, you're going to know it's like, yeah, groceries are going through the roof.
[03:00:12.150 --> 03:00:13.813]  We're not making ends meet.
[03:00:14.053 --> 03:00:16.176]  It's hard to even maintain a budget in our house.
[03:00:16.597 --> 03:00:17.478]  Prices are going up.
[03:00:17.899 --> 03:00:19.301]  Inflation is there.
[03:00:19.681 --> 03:00:26.131]  Now, Alex, inflation has been understated for years, since 1996 actually.
[03:00:28.234 --> 03:00:37.044]  So everybody watching this, back after Carter was president, if you're old enough to remember that, he destroyed the economy.
[03:00:37.525 --> 03:00:40.027]  One of the worst financial presidents ever.
[03:00:41.649 --> 03:00:44.092]  Massive recession, dollar was collapsing.
[03:00:44.412 --> 03:00:46.574]  Inflation was at 14.3 percent.
[03:00:46.634 --> 03:00:47.475]  Nobody was working.
[03:00:47.515 --> 03:00:49.297]  They were rationing at the gas pumps.
[03:00:49.337 --> 03:00:50.818]  You had OPEC going crazy.
[03:00:50.878 --> 03:00:53.080]  And it's like, oh my word, this is bad.
[03:00:53.480 --> 03:00:58.525]  So Reagan came in with Paul Volcker, who was chairman of the Fed at the time, and said, hey, we can fix this runaway inflation.
[03:00:58.865 --> 03:01:01.287]  We've got to jack up interest rates to 18 percent.
[03:01:01.768 --> 03:01:01.908]  Right?
[03:01:01.928 --> 03:01:04.250]  So in 1983, interest rates were 18 percent.
[03:01:04.610 --> 03:01:09.275]  If you bought a house back then, 30-year mortgage was 18 percent interest rate.
[03:01:09.915 --> 03:01:10.195]  Why?
[03:01:11.016 --> 03:01:14.400]  This is, as an economist, as a PhD economist, I always have to ask why.
[03:01:14.821 --> 03:01:16.162]  It was because inflation was 14.3.
[03:01:17.063 --> 03:01:24.252]  The only way to slow down inflation with interest rates is to actually have the interest rates be higher than the inflation rate.
[03:01:24.792 --> 03:01:25.653]  And that's what they did.
[03:01:26.034 --> 03:01:27.175]  So, fast forward to 1996.
[03:01:28.877 --> 03:01:36.599]  President Clinton at the time commissioned the Boskin Commission in Congress to say, hey, we've got way too many cost of living adjustments going out.
[03:01:36.999 --> 03:01:38.380]  We have to understate inflation.
[03:01:38.400 --> 03:01:39.700]  We have to artificially lower it.
[03:01:40.180 --> 03:01:42.921]  So this is not their words, but this is what the actions did.
[03:01:42.941 --> 03:01:45.802]  It's like, we've got to stick it to the American public.
[03:01:45.902 --> 03:01:52.424]  Everyone that voted for us, we've got to lower the money that we're paying to them so the government can make more money.
[03:01:53.004 --> 03:01:55.546]  So they artificially lowered inflation.
[03:01:55.586 --> 03:01:58.990]  This is very important because it applies to what we're doing today.
[03:01:59.610 --> 03:02:05.676]  So with substitution bias, with all these different price adjustments, they figured out how they can lower inflation.
[03:02:06.416 --> 03:02:15.305]  So when I was doing my first dissertation, I developed a new methodology for measuring inflation because the way that the BLS does it, it's broken.
[03:02:16.746 --> 03:02:18.387]  So, substitution bias.
[03:02:18.748 --> 03:02:23.111]  Let's say the CPI, the Consumer Price Index, is a basket of goods, 30 goods.
[03:02:23.612 --> 03:02:29.317]  Let's say steak is one of those goods, like, you know, filet, prime rib, whatever, steak.
[03:02:29.877 --> 03:02:35.542]  So, if the price of steak goes up 30%, they say, nuts, we don't want this in there anymore.
[03:02:35.842 --> 03:02:38.324]  Let's substitute steak with hamburger.
[03:02:38.685 --> 03:02:40.827]  Hamburger is 40% less than steak.
[03:02:41.127 --> 03:02:43.069]  So, what did they say happened to the price of steak?
[03:02:43.669 --> 03:02:45.030]  They didn't say it went up 30%.
[03:02:45.070 --> 03:02:50.414]  They said the price of steak came down 40% because they substituted it with hamburger.
[03:02:50.674 --> 03:03:19.850]   That means that the inflation numbers that we're seeing are completely bogus, completely manufactured, but if you apply the same metrics that we had in 1983 to today without Clinton's substitution bias, we're hovering at around 15% inflation, which means I don't believe for a second, Alex, that they're going to stop lowering interest rates because they have to get interest rates higher than... Sure, so they know this is coming, and they know silver is going to go up, so they've stopped shorting it.
[03:03:20.430 --> 03:03:21.411]  That's just my layman's term.
[03:03:21.471 --> 03:03:22.691]  This is so powerful.
[03:03:22.971 --> 03:03:27.873]  When you laid that out the last 20 minutes, I'm going to take this and post it tomorrow on xinfowars.com.
[03:03:27.893 --> 03:03:29.113]  This is a no-brainer, it looks like.
[03:03:29.414 --> 03:03:35.885]   People are getting into silver, but they don't want to pay over, they want to pay A little fee to get a good deal with you.
[03:03:35.965 --> 03:03:37.806]  They need to get silver right now and you're ready to ship it to them.
[03:03:38.086 --> 03:03:38.787]  Ready to ship it to them.
[03:03:38.807 --> 03:03:41.028]  We drop ship from the depositories.
[03:03:41.388 --> 03:03:42.789]  We don't maintain an inventory.
[03:03:42.829 --> 03:03:43.989]  We don't carry an inventory.
[03:03:44.710 --> 03:03:46.151]  That's how companies go out of business.
[03:03:46.171 --> 03:03:50.953]  And that's the only way you're, people that know the business, if you're doing a bunch of numismatic scams, you couldn't do that.
[03:03:51.013 --> 03:03:53.474]  You have direct deals as a commodity.
[03:03:53.855 --> 03:03:54.935]  You're doing this as a commodity.
[03:03:55.175 --> 03:03:56.616]  As physical silver.
[03:03:56.636 --> 03:03:58.397]  100 ounce bars, 10 ounce bars, 1 ounce round.
[03:03:58.437 --> 03:03:59.718]  That's how you know it's set, folks.
[03:03:59.758 --> 03:04:00.358]  It's not a scam.
[03:04:00.618 --> 03:04:06.562]  Yeah, drop shipped from the depository directly to your house, directly into your IRA account.
[03:04:06.622 --> 03:04:08.804]  People calling you with a little fee, it's for the advice.
[03:04:09.755 --> 03:04:11.136]  Yes, it's the cost of ownership.
[03:04:11.156 --> 03:04:11.857]  And handling it all.
[03:04:12.137 --> 03:04:18.341]  But this is one where, you know, this is one area where we're different than every other firm in the industry, really.
[03:04:18.922 --> 03:04:21.063]  When you liquidate, you want to lock in profits.
[03:04:21.243 --> 03:04:23.685]  Yeah, but also you're different because nobody's as articulate as you.
[03:04:23.945 --> 03:04:37.755]  I think, I literally, I told this a year ago, I said, God, I want to help people with silver and gold, we can't get a real company, give me, and literally, then you, I was like, asking you on as a guest, and somebody else goes, hey, this guy wants to be a sponsor, literally an answer prayer.
[03:04:39.224 --> 03:04:40.427]  You're also a theologian, I know.
[03:04:41.109 --> 03:04:44.758]  Yeah, it's one of my PhDs in theology, but... Well, that's a whole other subject.
[03:04:44.778 --> 03:04:45.259]  We'll hit the minute.
[03:04:45.279 --> 03:04:46.602]  Where do you think we are on the timeline?
[03:04:46.622 --> 03:04:47.845]  Because it's all being fulfilled, I mean...
[03:04:48.689 --> 03:04:49.529]  Okay.
[03:04:49.549 --> 03:04:50.669]  That's a whole other subject.
[03:04:50.689 --> 03:04:51.530]  A whole other subject?
[03:04:51.610 --> 03:04:53.030]  I can answer what I think.
[03:04:53.110 --> 03:04:54.870]  We'll do a whole other show on that.
[03:04:54.930 --> 03:04:58.751]  But when you liquidate your assets, we don't charge a commission when you liquidate.
[03:04:59.111 --> 03:05:04.313]  So whatever the depository pays for metals on the day you want out, you get all of it, 100% of it, because we don't take anything.
[03:05:04.733 --> 03:05:07.613]  So operationally, we're different than other firms.
[03:05:07.914 --> 03:05:09.434]  Most firms are transactionally based.
[03:05:09.454 --> 03:05:12.415]  You make a commission when you buy, a commission when you sell, they forget about you in between.
[03:05:12.895 --> 03:05:15.895]  We love the relationship on the in-between.
[03:05:16.195 --> 03:05:18.016]  To me, those transactions are the bookends.
[03:05:18.416 --> 03:05:22.220]  But there's an 8% cost of ownership when you buy, zero when you liquidate.
[03:05:22.240 --> 03:05:23.361]  So what does that tell you?
[03:05:23.721 --> 03:05:28.425]  You know exactly what silver has to do to ask for you to break even.
[03:05:28.505 --> 03:05:29.506]  It's an 8% growth.
[03:05:29.526 --> 03:05:31.768]  And you said in the last month it's already gone up that amount.
[03:05:32.854 --> 03:05:35.037]  In the last week, it's gone up almost 5%.
[03:05:36.199 --> 03:05:42.066]  Because when we saw that short news, how 50% of them were liquidated, literally.
[03:05:42.366 --> 03:05:46.351]  Silver went from 2213 to like 2330 in a week.
[03:05:46.872 --> 03:05:48.194]  And you predicted then it would happen?
[03:05:48.454 --> 03:05:48.654]  Yes.
[03:05:49.738 --> 03:05:51.139]  I mean, it's not rocket science.
[03:05:51.239 --> 03:05:57.064]  So, spell it out to me, because I'm a little smart, but spell it out to me like I'm five years old.
[03:05:57.804 --> 03:06:02.448]  They are killing their shorts at a level never before seen because they're getting out of the way.
[03:06:02.868 --> 03:06:04.569]  Yeah, because they think that silver is going to go up.
[03:06:04.969 --> 03:06:06.951]  Why do they think that silver is going to go up?
[03:06:07.371 --> 03:06:18.957]   So, if you're a hedge fund, if you're a big bank and you look at numbers that most people don't look at, The problem is the inflationary pressures, the unsustainable debt, the political chaos, the geopolitical conflict.
[03:06:19.077 --> 03:06:21.798]  Those are the fundamental forces that cause markets to move.
[03:06:22.458 --> 03:06:24.859]  So here's an interesting thing.
[03:06:25.179 --> 03:06:41.387]   The GDP, Gross Domestic Product, which is a reflection, Alex, of everything that you and I buy at stores, everything that everybody watching this is going to stores, paying retail prices, A gross domestic product is that with everything that's manufactured and created in the country.
[03:06:41.607 --> 03:06:42.908]  It's an index of the economy.
[03:06:43.068 --> 03:06:53.796]  Yeah, so if inflation is at 15%, and follow me on this, if inflation is at 15%, GDP is a reflection of everything that we're buying stuff on.
[03:06:54.296 --> 03:06:55.357]  GDP should be growing at 15%.
[03:06:56.838 --> 03:06:59.741]  If inflation's at 15% and it's a reflection of everything... That's what Biden says!
[03:06:59.801 --> 03:07:01.763]  Oh, inflation, because we're making... No, no, it's not.
[03:07:02.324 --> 03:07:03.945]  GDP's not, what, at 3%?
[03:07:03.985 --> 03:07:13.675]  Yeah, well, yeah, GDP, so they were bragging about this, they wanted to beat the market consensus of 2% growth in the GDP, and they were bragging about it.
[03:07:13.695 --> 03:07:15.337]  It's like, why are you bragging about 2%?
[03:07:16.678 --> 03:07:17.518]  That's not good.
[03:07:17.538 --> 03:07:20.619]  15% is just keeping up with inflation.
[03:07:20.719 --> 03:07:21.220]  Wow.
[03:07:21.280 --> 03:07:24.221]  So at 2% that tells me the economy is actually shrinking.
[03:07:24.481 --> 03:07:26.961]  I'm letting one of the two, because I know Biden predicted three.
[03:07:27.001 --> 03:07:27.722]  I guess it's only two.
[03:07:28.122 --> 03:07:28.282]  Yeah.
[03:07:28.302 --> 03:07:29.502]  I mean, even they call that a win.
[03:07:29.942 --> 03:07:32.283]  They call that a win because they're going to call everything a win.
[03:07:32.623 --> 03:07:37.865]  But here's where it gets really, really bizarre and really, really scary, Alex.
[03:07:38.385 --> 03:07:46.943]   So with this, to create $1 of GDP, They have to spend $2.50 in debt.
[03:07:47.443 --> 03:07:49.664]  By the way, you showed this a month ago when you were on.
[03:07:50.324 --> 03:07:50.825]  It's my fault.
[03:07:50.905 --> 03:07:51.465]  I should tell the crew.
[03:07:52.045 --> 03:07:59.049]  What graph do they pull up from Zero Hedge or Dow Jones that shows how Biden's created more money when he's been in office than it was ever created before?
[03:07:59.089 --> 03:07:59.909]  It's going straight up.
[03:08:00.290 --> 03:08:00.650]  Straight up.
[03:08:00.690 --> 03:08:02.951]  I mean, that's money supply creation.
[03:08:02.991 --> 03:08:05.152]  Guys, pull up a graph, U.S.
[03:08:05.192 --> 03:08:06.113]  money supply creation.
[03:08:06.633 --> 03:08:11.134]  Yeah, and so there's, you've got a couple of graphs you could look at.
[03:08:11.154 --> 03:08:21.717]  You could look at the debt, you could look at money supply, but money supply is starting to trick people because a few years ago they stopped measuring total money supply.
[03:08:21.737 --> 03:08:22.457]  It was called MZM.
[03:08:22.477 --> 03:08:22.977]  That's right.
[03:08:23.357 --> 03:08:26.558]  So they stopped, because that's everything that's created for stimulus.
[03:08:26.658 --> 03:08:28.339]  So when I see the graph going straight up, what is that?
[03:08:30.109 --> 03:08:35.092]  So, going straight up is actually the debt that we're creating.
[03:08:35.713 --> 03:08:36.173]  Like $37 trillion?
[03:08:36.193 --> 03:08:36.473]  $37 trillion.
[03:08:36.493 --> 03:08:39.315]  So, from 1776 until 1980 when Reagan became president, you know, that's 204 years.
[03:08:39.134 --> 03:08:47.614]   1776 until 1980 when Reagan became president You know that's two hundred and four years. We went there's
[03:08:47.614 --> 03:08:52.674]   the graph. Yeah, we went from zero to okay, this
[03:08:52.182 --> 03:08:55.541]  This is very important.
[03:08:55.541 --> 03:09:00.101]   We went from zero to almost a trillion dollars worth of debt in 204 years.
[03:09:00.101 --> 03:09:08.381]   The budget, Biden's stinking budget for 2024 has over 2.5 trillion dollars of deficit.
[03:09:08.381 --> 03:09:09.982]  2.5 trillion dollars.
[03:09:09.982 --> 03:09:15.142]   Well, it took us 204 years to accumulate almost a trillion and he's adding 2.5 plus trillion
[03:09:15.142 --> 03:09:16.142]  in just one year.
[03:09:16.422 --> 03:09:17.863]  They're spending like drunken sailors.
[03:09:18.204 --> 03:09:19.104]  So how do you do that?
[03:09:19.245 --> 03:09:24.269]  Now that chart that you're looking at there, that's actually money supply.
[03:09:24.309 --> 03:09:26.570]  That's money that's being printed, right?
[03:09:26.671 --> 03:09:33.356]  So the M2 money supply going through the roof, that's money in your checking account, savings account, money markets.
[03:09:33.676 --> 03:09:36.479]  Now you see at the tail end of that that it's starting to come down.
[03:09:37.239 --> 03:09:38.919]  What does that show me?
[03:09:39.420 --> 03:09:44.961]  Because they're printing money like there's no tomorrow, but that's a different money supply that they stopped creating.
[03:09:45.061 --> 03:09:55.543]  This money is money that's in the bank, which tells me banks are under-capitalized, they're starting to pull money out of the system in exchange and preparing for central bank digital currency.
[03:09:55.903 --> 03:10:03.585]  Because you can't have digital money parallel with paper money, because one is private, and the big boys are pulling back to protect themselves.
[03:10:03.945 --> 03:10:04.586]  They're pulling back.
[03:10:04.606 --> 03:10:06.127]  They're pulling out of the system.
[03:10:06.568 --> 03:10:08.170]  And that's what that number tells us.
[03:10:08.190 --> 03:10:09.451]  So we can't just glaze over that.
[03:10:09.491 --> 03:10:10.672]  I mean, I get chills.
[03:10:11.133 --> 03:10:13.075]  Because I'm not an economist like you, but I've been following this.
[03:10:13.115 --> 03:10:14.256]  I can get it, the signs.
[03:10:14.937 --> 03:10:16.218]  This is unprecedented.
[03:10:17.139 --> 03:10:20.102]  They're getting in the live boats while they have us rearranging deck chairs at the Titanic.
[03:10:20.483 --> 03:10:25.769]  The last time we saw this kind of M2 money supply shrinking was the Great Depression.
[03:10:26.904 --> 03:10:29.066]  But that was something different.
[03:10:29.626 --> 03:10:37.933]  So what we have this time is money is leaving the system, Alex, because they're preparing us for a digital currency.
[03:10:38.333 --> 03:10:49.001]  You can't have a digital currency that they want to control every aspect of your buying, selling, all of your ideology, everything, and still have paper money at the same time, because paper money is private.
[03:10:49.301 --> 03:10:51.863]  When you spend a $20 bill, nobody knows it was you.
[03:10:52.284 --> 03:10:53.785]  That's what they're trying to get away from.
[03:10:54.105 --> 03:11:06.233]  But here's where the unsustainability of the system that we're in, which is why I think we are so close to collapse, $2.50 of debt spending to get $1 of GDP growth.
[03:11:06.333 --> 03:11:08.174]  So let me put it into story context.
[03:11:10.379 --> 03:11:14.741]  Straight up, a hundred plus years of debt to just get a tiny response.
[03:11:14.981 --> 03:11:15.602]  They're out of bullets.
[03:11:15.822 --> 03:11:16.522]  They're out of bullets.
[03:11:16.822 --> 03:11:22.305]  So let's say you're sitting at the dinner table with your wife and you say, hey honey, I've got a great business idea.
[03:11:22.685 --> 03:11:24.326]  I'm going to spend $250,000 to generate $100,000 worth of income.
[03:11:24.346 --> 03:11:24.927]  She'd divorce you.
[03:11:27.828 --> 03:11:31.469]  She would slap you upside the head and say, Alex, you are the dumbest person that I've ever seen in my life.
[03:11:31.489 --> 03:11:32.790]  You're going to bankrupt our family.
[03:11:32.890 --> 03:11:34.030]  What is wrong with you?
[03:11:34.450 --> 03:11:34.650]  Right?
[03:11:35.351 --> 03:11:37.511]  But this is exactly what the government's doing.
[03:11:38.012 --> 03:11:40.952]  Spending $2.50 to generate $1 of growth?
[03:11:41.073 --> 03:11:42.173]  That's unsustainable.
[03:11:42.553 --> 03:11:44.614]  That's how, as an economist, I can tell.
[03:11:44.634 --> 03:11:46.234]  Let's pull back.
[03:11:46.254 --> 03:11:48.755]  Just put on your American citizen hat, doctor.
[03:11:50.156 --> 03:11:50.576]  Speculate.
[03:11:50.636 --> 03:11:51.996]  How do you see this unfolding?
[03:11:52.016 --> 03:11:53.017]  What are the different scenarios?
[03:11:53.357 --> 03:11:54.097]  People want to know that.
[03:11:56.269 --> 03:12:03.515]  So as 2024 rolls into an election, what do I think is going to happen?
[03:12:03.595 --> 03:12:05.716]  I think we're going to see a crisis.
[03:12:06.653 --> 03:12:08.074]  Probably like nothing we've ever seen.
[03:12:08.094 --> 03:12:09.635]  I think we're going to see banking crisis.
[03:12:10.235 --> 03:12:17.099]  I think we're going to see interest rates continue to climb, which means people are not going to be able to pay their bills.
[03:12:17.119 --> 03:12:18.740]  They're not going to be able to sustain their debt.
[03:12:19.121 --> 03:12:21.042]  They're not going to be able to feed their family, right?
[03:12:21.062 --> 03:12:30.928]  I'm painting a picture that looks grim because it really is, but here's where, this is where they want the picture, what they want the picture to look like.
[03:12:31.488 --> 03:12:34.236]  Because in an election year, politicians do what, Alex?
[03:12:34.276 --> 03:12:35.760]  They promise the moon.
[03:12:36.222 --> 03:12:38.949]  And they promise other people's money to get votes.
[03:12:39.670 --> 03:12:49.072]  You know, you and I have talked about this before and I know that you're a massive student of history and you love the Roman Republic and the fall of Rome and talking about that, but this started back then, right?
[03:12:49.172 --> 03:12:56.814]  Rome fell when the encumbrances, when the weight of the entitlement system buried them.
[03:12:56.834 --> 03:13:03.015]  They couldn't keep up with it and that was one-third of Rome was on government assistance at that time when Rome fell.
[03:13:03.515 --> 03:13:10.257]   We are now at over eighty percent Of everything that we bring in as a nation goes towards entitlement.
[03:13:10.317 --> 03:13:14.678]  Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Women, Infant, Children, Programs, Food Stamps, all those handouts, right?
[03:13:15.178 --> 03:13:16.878]  Social Security is a mandatory payment.
[03:13:16.938 --> 03:13:17.838]  It's not an entitlement.
[03:13:18.298 --> 03:13:22.099]  If you're paying into it your whole life, you should expect to get something out of it.
[03:13:22.539 --> 03:13:30.361]  But you can't take it away because it's really easy in today's society to give, really hard to take away, right?
[03:13:30.421 --> 03:13:35.583]   So in an election year, You're going to see promises of other people's money.
[03:13:35.603 --> 03:13:38.504]  You're going to see promises of everything to get votes.
[03:13:39.205 --> 03:13:42.667]  And I think this is where we start to see the unraveling.
[03:13:43.147 --> 03:13:48.129]  Because as interest rates continue to climb, that starts with delinquencies.
[03:13:48.230 --> 03:13:49.810]  People being late on their payments.
[03:13:50.171 --> 03:13:52.692]  Delinquencies over time end up in default.
[03:13:53.032 --> 03:13:56.414]  When you have too many defaults at banks, they start to go under.
[03:13:56.654 --> 03:14:04.573]   This is why I think we're going to see, number one this year, another systemic bank failure.
[03:14:04.573 --> 03:14:06.293]  And it's going to be a lot of them this time.
[03:14:06.293 --> 03:14:08.213]  I think it's going to be something bigger.
[03:14:08.213 --> 03:14:13.173]   I think people are going to start giving away their freedoms in exchange for perceived security
[03:14:13.173 --> 03:14:14.654]  and risk because of it.
[03:14:14.654 --> 03:14:22.094]   I think that the BRICS nations are going to really start to flex and pull away petrodollar
[03:14:22.094 --> 03:14:26.254]   status because they're trading in 70% of the world's trading block.
[03:14:26.291 --> 03:14:31.873]  I mean, it's a huge trading block, 70% of the world's population, not using the US dollar, but using their currency.
[03:14:32.193 --> 03:14:37.514]  That means demand for the dollar goes away, which means they're going to print like no tomorrow, right?
[03:14:37.534 --> 03:14:42.736]  When we lose reserve currency status, the end result is simple.
[03:14:43.436 --> 03:14:55.744]  We end up like Argentina, Venezuela, Cyprus, Greece, Zimbabwe, you name a country that's gone through a massive inflationary spiral, we are going to be no different than them.
[03:14:56.665 --> 03:15:01.168]  It's impossible to be different from them when you don't have built-in demand from your currency.
[03:15:01.188 --> 03:15:03.490]  And I hate to say this, because I'm an American.
[03:15:03.630 --> 03:15:04.570]  I love this country.
[03:15:04.690 --> 03:15:05.391]  I'm a patriot.
[03:15:05.831 --> 03:15:10.156]  I want the dollar to be strong, but there's no way that it can be under current policies.
[03:15:10.557 --> 03:15:12.098]  And this is where we're headed this year.
[03:15:12.138 --> 03:15:17.204]  So I think under that, you know, it was Rahm Emanuel that said, never let a good crisis go to waste, right?
[03:15:17.244 --> 03:15:20.047]  They're going to let this crisis work in their favor.
[03:15:20.848 --> 03:15:23.950]  So they can actually start to strip away freedoms.
[03:15:23.991 --> 03:15:37.561]  This is where I see America headed and I don't want anybody watching this to actually operate in fear, have your head in the sand thinking like an ostrich in a windstorm saying, hopefully if I just hide this and I don't think about it, it's going to go away.
[03:15:38.141 --> 03:15:41.824]  No, if you do that, you probably should be scared because I think that you'll fail.
[03:15:42.265 --> 03:15:56.230]   But if you take action See, if you take action, allocate into tangible assets like gold and silver to get out of the paper, get out of the digital assets that make you a digital slave in their digital world.
[03:15:56.691 --> 03:16:02.012]  This is where you can actually start to just thrive and have a smile on your face.
[03:16:02.352 --> 03:16:03.693]  So this is gold and silver.
[03:16:03.773 --> 03:16:13.416]  One of the weird things, Alex, where not only is it a good investment, but I think it's the ultimate protector against loss of financial privacy, against loss of financial freedom.
[03:16:14.116 --> 03:16:16.907]  And that's why I'm shouting it from the rooftops.
[03:16:17.523 --> 03:16:31.546]  To anybody that will listen because I believe, you know, being a PhD economist and putting these puzzle pieces together of the economy, of politics, of personal freedoms, of religious freedoms, all being stripped away from us, right?
[03:16:32.066 --> 03:16:45.649]  If you put all those together, it paints a good picture of where we are in our society and political consequences are having economic implications which are going to basically result in societal change.
[03:16:46.289 --> 03:16:48.050]  This is where I think that we're headed.
[03:16:49.250 --> 03:16:51.792]  Massive societal disruption this year.
[03:16:51.812 --> 03:16:53.292]  We're already seeing it in Texas.
[03:16:54.113 --> 03:16:58.234]  We're already seeing that in Denver, for example, where I live.
[03:16:58.775 --> 03:17:04.257]  This migrant crisis, Alex, is creating a fiscal cliff that we're about to fall off of.
[03:17:04.877 --> 03:17:08.879]  So Denver, you know, there are just illegal aliens everywhere.
[03:17:08.959 --> 03:17:10.400]  I mean, we showed footage this week.
[03:17:10.460 --> 03:17:12.461]  It's right here in Austin, driving to work today.
[03:17:13.832 --> 03:17:15.234]  Pulled off and got gas on the side road.
[03:17:15.254 --> 03:17:17.156]  It's just homeless everywhere and illegal aliens everywhere.
[03:17:17.477 --> 03:17:17.797]  Everywhere.
[03:17:17.817 --> 03:17:24.024]  I mean, we look out, we're right downtown where our office is, and we look out the window and there's migrants everywhere.
[03:17:24.325 --> 03:17:25.767]  I'm telling you, it's everywhere.
[03:17:26.087 --> 03:17:32.635]  By the way, you hit something five minutes ago, because I'm running around behind the scenes here while you're talking, saying that clip's amazing, get that out, do this.
[03:17:33.885 --> 03:17:38.990]  But you explain, they admit they're crashing the system to bring in social control to the central major currencies.
[03:17:39.010 --> 03:17:40.872]  This is not speculation, they're doing this.
[03:17:41.313 --> 03:17:42.794]  This is making us poor to control us.
[03:17:43.235 --> 03:17:48.320]  So the answer is people need to be prosperous, at least positioned to protect themselves for their own autonomy.
[03:17:48.721 --> 03:17:53.546]  Well, yeah, so, and I can show people... Yeah, go through all the rest of your stuff here.
[03:17:53.846 --> 03:17:57.168]  So I can show people where they're actually talking about this.
[03:17:57.248 --> 03:18:02.371]  So you go to Uniform Commercial Code Article 8, for example.
[03:18:02.811 --> 03:18:06.673]  This was, oh man, this was done like in 2008, 2009 after that crisis.
[03:18:06.693 --> 03:18:07.674]  Let me get this ready for a while.
[03:18:10.077 --> 03:18:11.378]  Yeah, this isn't anything new.
[03:18:11.718 --> 03:18:12.399]  This has been planned.
[03:18:12.419 --> 03:18:13.659]  They've been pre-positioning a while.
[03:18:13.679 --> 03:18:15.300]  The thing is, it's coming though.
[03:18:16.001 --> 03:18:17.302]  Bank robbers planned a bank robbery.
[03:18:17.322 --> 03:18:18.382]  They're hitting the bank now.
[03:18:18.983 --> 03:18:24.066]  Yeah, so this basically talks about, this is key, this was in 2008.
[03:18:24.987 --> 03:18:28.189]  If you put money into the bank, Alex, you assume that that's your money.
[03:18:28.772 --> 03:18:29.472]  No, it's not.
[03:18:29.693 --> 03:18:30.873]  They have bail-in stuff.
[03:18:31.153 --> 03:18:43.500]  They have bail-in stuff, but this Uniform Commercial Code Article 8 basically changed ownership so during that crisis they needed your assets to be collateral so they could pay off all their derivatives debt.
[03:18:43.860 --> 03:18:45.800]  So on this, what happened?
[03:18:46.260 --> 03:18:54.462]  You changed ownership from you to the bank of your assets, and you became a beneficial owner, which sounds kind of sweet and kind of nice, but it's not.
[03:18:55.142 --> 03:18:55.802]  I love it!
[03:18:55.842 --> 03:18:57.642]  Like, they take your rights away and they call it beneficial.
[03:18:57.882 --> 03:19:01.883]  Yeah, you're a beneficiary of the ownership of your assets.
[03:19:02.223 --> 03:19:04.844]  If you knock me out and say that's beneficial, no it's not.
[03:19:04.864 --> 03:19:07.584]  I don't care what they call it.
[03:19:07.964 --> 03:19:10.284]  So it's a security, right?
[03:19:10.345 --> 03:19:14.431]   Because when you put money in the bank, this is where people think, Money in the bank is safe.
[03:19:14.491 --> 03:19:14.931]  No, it's not.
[03:19:15.392 --> 03:19:22.278]  When you deposit a hundred bucks, basically you're giving it to them, they become the owner, you're a beneficial owner, and they will let you use it if you want to.
[03:19:22.298 --> 03:19:25.941]  But you're just hoping that your money is there when you want to withdraw it.
[03:19:26.341 --> 03:19:30.965]  The banks are hoping that not everybody wants to withdraw it at the same time, because they have a zero-profit service provider.
[03:19:30.985 --> 03:19:33.407]  Well, the globalists are quietly withdrawing buying gold and silver.
[03:19:33.807 --> 03:19:34.648]  Massive amounts!
[03:19:34.668 --> 03:19:35.449]  That's the bottom line.
[03:19:35.549 --> 03:19:37.630]  They're withdrawing buying hard assets.
[03:19:38.571 --> 03:19:45.198]  And farmland, mines, gold, silver, but then they're telling us to stay in the stock market.
[03:19:45.558 --> 03:19:52.165]  Yeah, so your assets in the bank have become a security instrument for the bank, that you are no longer an owner of.
[03:19:52.185 --> 03:19:55.248]  So that's an expansion of kind of the derivatives and the sell and the mortgages a hundred times.
[03:19:55.408 --> 03:19:55.648]  Yes.
[03:19:56.409 --> 03:19:58.391]  Then go fast forward to one more time.
[03:19:59.125 --> 03:20:10.172]  August 9th of 2019, Federal Reserve Docket OP1670, basically this actually paved the way for central bank digital currency under that.
[03:20:10.252 --> 03:20:15.415]  Because in this document, they changed the definition of money.
[03:20:15.935 --> 03:20:21.739]  The Federal Reserve, this is their own words, they said there is a fourth function of money as a means of social control.
[03:20:22.299 --> 03:20:24.461]  By the way, this was a big deal when you did this a month ago.
[03:20:24.842 --> 03:20:27.604]  You only did two minutes and I got a lot of complaints that you didn't go deeper.
[03:20:27.624 --> 03:20:28.825]  So, I'm not going to interrupt.
[03:20:28.885 --> 03:20:29.606]  Ten minutes on this.
[03:20:29.866 --> 03:20:30.087]  Okay.
[03:20:30.747 --> 03:20:31.428]  Start over.
[03:20:32.008 --> 03:20:35.332]  So, fourth function of money, instead of... New definition.
[03:20:35.352 --> 03:20:35.712]  Explain it.
[03:20:35.972 --> 03:20:36.132]  Yeah.
[03:20:36.813 --> 03:20:37.894]  Instead, what is money?
[03:20:37.934 --> 03:20:39.035]  It's a medium of exchange.
[03:20:39.095 --> 03:20:40.316]  It's a hold of value.
[03:20:41.197 --> 03:20:42.278]  You know, that's what money is.
[03:20:42.739 --> 03:20:45.841]  You use 20 bucks to go to the store and buy... Is it agreed upon?
[03:20:47.262 --> 03:20:53.342]   Exchange thing yep, and it still is but now they added this fourth function as a means of social control
[03:20:53.342 --> 03:20:56.642]   Which is like social control? What does money have to do with that?
[03:20:56.642 --> 03:21:03.961]   I find it they say social control yeah, so social control means if they want to get a policy of like climate change
[03:21:03.961 --> 03:21:09.141]   in and You're you have a big gas guzzling truck like I do
[03:21:09.860 --> 03:21:11.301]  Doesn't get very good gas mileage.
[03:21:11.681 --> 03:21:11.821]  Right?
[03:21:11.861 --> 03:21:16.523]  And they say, Alex, uh, we're not going to let you under digital currency system.
[03:21:16.723 --> 03:21:19.124]  They can say, you're going to the gas station way too much.
[03:21:19.204 --> 03:21:20.925]  We'll just flip the switch, shut it off.
[03:21:20.985 --> 03:21:22.185]  So you can't buy that.
[03:21:22.325 --> 03:21:23.506]  Or charge you a surcharge.
[03:21:23.686 --> 03:21:23.886]  Yeah.
[03:21:24.006 --> 03:21:25.787]  Or we want you to buy an electric vehicle.
[03:21:26.107 --> 03:21:27.727]  So this is social control.
[03:21:28.208 --> 03:21:30.509]  By the way, they're saying they're going to do that.
[03:21:30.549 --> 03:21:31.729]  It's not like you're speculating.
[03:21:31.829 --> 03:21:34.370]  No, this is Federal Reserve Docket OP1670.
[03:21:34.410 --> 03:21:36.451]  I mean, it's not my opinion, it's their words.
[03:21:36.952 --> 03:21:41.794]  So, let's say you give to a church, because you're tithing, and they say, what?
[03:21:42.214 --> 03:21:43.135]  We don't like that church.
[03:21:43.175 --> 03:21:44.495]  They speak hate speech, right?
[03:21:44.535 --> 03:21:45.776]  And so we're going to cut you off.
[03:21:45.796 --> 03:21:46.817]  And they said they don't want that.
[03:21:47.157 --> 03:21:47.317]  Yeah.
[03:21:47.737 --> 03:21:48.799]  We're going to cut you off from being able to go.
[03:21:48.819 --> 03:21:51.903]  And where are the charges if they're sitting there having no idea they're about to have the rug pulled out from under them?
[03:21:52.644 --> 03:21:53.285]  No idea.
[03:21:53.385 --> 03:21:55.929]  So then you go to 11-8-2019 U.S.
[03:21:55.748 --> 03:22:06.308]   11/8/2019 US patent 62/758430. Visa applied for this patent, the credit card company.
[03:22:07.142 --> 03:22:07.222]  Yes.
[03:22:07.242 --> 03:22:07.302]  323 of 2020.
[03:22:07.141 --> 03:22:08.461]  What did the patent say?
[03:22:08.461 --> 03:22:13.980]   It says we are actually applying for a patent to create digital money, a digital wallet,
[03:22:13.980 --> 03:22:19.661]   and every unit of digital money that's placed, we're going to take away one unit of paper
[03:22:19.661 --> 03:22:20.661]  currency.
[03:22:20.661 --> 03:22:24.582]  Elimination of paper currency to go to digital money.
[03:22:24.582 --> 03:22:28.141]   So this is their plan to get out of their Ponzi scheme as a new one.
[03:22:28.141 --> 03:22:29.141]  Yes.
[03:22:29.141 --> 03:22:31.141]  3/23 of 2020.
[03:22:31.141 --> 03:22:33.902]  HR 6321.
[03:22:33.902 --> 03:22:37.141]  The great Maxine Waters sponsored this one.
[03:22:37.147 --> 03:22:37.867]  So what is that?
[03:22:38.287 --> 03:22:43.367]   She said during the crisis, during the pandemic, right, that they manufactured,
[03:22:43.367 --> 03:22:48.666]   if anybody wanted government stimulus money, what did they say?
[03:22:48.666 --> 03:22:52.966]   It said they have to have a digital dollar, they have to have a digital dollar wallet
[03:22:52.966 --> 03:22:54.567]  issued by a member bank.
[03:22:54.567 --> 03:22:59.646]   So if you want to receive government money, you're gonna have to go into a digital system.
[03:22:59.646 --> 03:23:01.207]  There is no other option.
[03:23:01.207 --> 03:23:02.447]  So extrapolate out--
[03:23:02.447 --> 03:23:03.926]  They're in the old system.
[03:23:03.926 --> 03:23:05.966]  Yeah, extrapolate that out into the future.
[03:23:05.966 --> 03:23:08.966]   And this is where I'm gonna start to bring in some theology stuff, Alex,
[03:23:08.966 --> 03:23:13.567]   because what if you want social security or a government pension?
[03:23:13.447 --> 03:23:18.031]  You've been working for the federal government, the military, whatever, your whole life and say, OK, you want to keep that coming?
[03:23:18.372 --> 03:23:20.073]  You have to have this FedNow app.
[03:23:20.113 --> 03:23:23.877]  You have to have this Mark of the Beast system or you're not going to be able to get it.
[03:23:23.897 --> 03:23:24.618]  It's like, what?
[03:23:24.878 --> 03:23:25.459]  I don't want that.
[03:23:25.519 --> 03:23:26.019]  Well, too bad.
[03:23:26.419 --> 03:23:28.361]  Either you take it or you don't get your money.
[03:23:28.421 --> 03:23:28.622]  Right.
[03:23:28.742 --> 03:23:28.922]  So.
[03:23:29.322 --> 03:23:29.643]  So then.
[03:23:30.203 --> 03:23:38.027]  March 9th of 2022, Executive Order 14067, Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets.
[03:23:38.047 --> 03:23:40.749]  This was penned by Biden, and what did he say?
[03:23:40.929 --> 03:23:44.591]  He authorized the move to central bank digital currency in America.
[03:23:44.771 --> 03:23:49.514]  That's where this all starts to come home at the Federal Reserve level.
[03:23:50.114 --> 03:24:00.860]  March 29th of 2022, Dr. Pippa Malmgren actually explained for the first time at the World Economic Forum, what is central bank digital currency?
[03:24:00.880 --> 03:24:02.040]  It's programmable money!
[03:24:03.001 --> 03:24:08.904]  Meaning, they can change who owns it, if your digital social profile... And say where you can spend it!
[03:24:10.140 --> 03:24:11.061]  They've admitted all this now.
[03:24:11.321 --> 03:24:13.462]  I mean, this is all their words.
[03:24:13.503 --> 03:24:14.303]  This is not mine.
[03:24:14.343 --> 03:24:16.325]  I don't want anybody to think this is my opinion.
[03:24:16.705 --> 03:24:19.046]  I'm just reporting what they said, right?
[03:24:19.207 --> 03:24:23.289]  The ability to cut you off your ability to buy or sell based on your social credit score.
[03:24:23.309 --> 03:24:28.514]   Well, they had the head of the European Central Bank, they had the head of the Yeah, and here's where it starts to now gain momentum.
[03:24:28.534 --> 03:24:30.736]  It's like a snowball rolling downhill, right?
[03:24:30.555 --> 03:24:33.434]   thing you do, we will control your behavior, we will do everything."
[03:24:33.434 --> 03:24:34.434]  They said it.
[03:24:34.434 --> 03:24:35.434]  Yeah.
[03:24:35.434 --> 03:24:39.035]  And here's where it starts to now gain momentum.
[03:24:39.035 --> 03:24:41.275]  It's like a snowball rolling downhill, right?
[03:24:41.275 --> 03:24:46.754]   So March of 2023, the United Nations, our Common Agenda Policy Brief.
[03:24:46.754 --> 03:24:49.394]  So the Secretary General of the UN.
[03:24:49.795 --> 03:24:59.540]  basically said they're convening to operationalize automatically an emergency platform in the event of a future complex global shock of sufficient scale, severity, and reach.
[03:24:59.580 --> 03:25:04.422]  So they tell you, we're going to use a virus for control, we're going to use a banking collapse for control, they're telling you.
[03:25:04.882 --> 03:25:07.324]  They tell us, and they tell us... And they artificially put the U.S.
[03:25:07.344 --> 03:25:10.966]  with the BRICS into policies to kill the dollar to create the crisis.
[03:25:11.166 --> 03:25:11.446]  Correct.
[03:25:11.826 --> 03:25:12.106]  Wow!
[03:25:12.186 --> 03:25:15.468]  So get a load of this... I think they're going to double-cross BRICS though when it comes time.
[03:25:16.248 --> 03:25:16.828]  I think so.
[03:25:17.408 --> 03:25:18.749]  Nobody can be trusted anywhere.
[03:25:19.049 --> 03:25:21.609]  Everyone's going to double-cross everybody, right?
[03:25:21.669 --> 03:25:31.451]  But here's where they tell us in the next paragraph, we don't have to think or speculate about what a global shock of sufficient scale, severity, and reach could be because they say, what is that?
[03:25:31.911 --> 03:25:44.553]  The emergency authority can be convened including a major climatic event, a future pandemic risk, a global digital connectivity disruption, a major event in outer space, and generic unforeseen risks like Black Swan.
[03:25:44.853 --> 03:25:47.218]  So they're talking about solar flares, asteroids.
[03:25:47.719 --> 03:25:49.403]  Yes, and a future pandemic risk.
[03:25:49.483 --> 03:25:51.167]  And what did you talk about last week?
[03:25:51.487 --> 03:25:52.750]  Stinking Ebola virus?
[03:25:54.109 --> 03:25:54.989]  They're cooking up in Colorado.
[03:25:55.009 --> 03:25:57.450]  They're cooking up in Colorado, in my backyard.
[03:25:57.830 --> 03:26:05.113]  Denver Health, all the employees taking the live Ebola vaccine, and the lab that's creating that is in Colorado Springs.
[03:26:05.153 --> 03:26:07.794]  It's like Wuhan in Colorado.
[03:26:08.334 --> 03:26:09.575]  Colorado Springs is the real U.S.
[03:26:09.595 --> 03:26:09.935]  Capitol.
[03:26:10.455 --> 03:26:13.896]  Yeah, I mean, what in the world is... For those that don't know, that's the real Capitol.
[03:26:14.116 --> 03:26:15.337]  They even have an alternate Congress.
[03:26:15.377 --> 03:26:16.117]  Everything's set up there.
[03:26:18.514 --> 03:26:18.794]  Geez.
[03:26:18.814 --> 03:26:19.474]  That's NORAD.
[03:26:19.975 --> 03:26:22.436]  Okay, so I'm basically living at ground zero.
[03:26:22.696 --> 03:26:22.916]  Thanks.
[03:26:23.377 --> 03:26:24.557]  Well, you're probably the most protected.
[03:26:24.577 --> 03:26:27.639]  I mean, that's the real capital is the Colorado Springs, yeah?
[03:26:27.859 --> 03:26:31.541]  Yeah, so keep... I mean, this... They got a whole underground capital.
[03:26:31.661 --> 03:26:32.122]  It's admitted.
[03:26:32.162 --> 03:26:33.142]  They got a whole thing there.
[03:26:33.403 --> 03:26:34.723]  And there is stuff under Denver.
[03:26:34.743 --> 03:26:35.684]  They call it a conspiracy.
[03:26:35.964 --> 03:26:37.445]  They've got underground bases everywhere.
[03:26:37.465 --> 03:26:38.285]  That's the real deal.
[03:26:38.505 --> 03:26:40.667]  When was the last time you were at Denver International Airport?
[03:26:41.247 --> 03:26:43.650]  It's... I know now they're countering the conspiracy theories.
[03:26:43.931 --> 03:26:49.098]  They got bathumet, they got gargoyles, they got murals of kids being slaughtered by Nazis.
[03:26:49.158 --> 03:26:49.718]  It's wild.
[03:26:49.838 --> 03:26:50.660]  Oh, it's wild.
[03:26:50.740 --> 03:26:52.943]  And now, they're doing all kinds of construction.
[03:26:53.123 --> 03:26:55.085]  You know, they put up the fake walls to hide the construction.
[03:26:55.105 --> 03:26:56.067]  Oh, I know the guys that built it.
[03:26:56.287 --> 03:26:56.808]  There are...
[03:26:58.652 --> 03:27:01.054]  It's an alternate B-52 base at Denver.
[03:27:01.314 --> 03:27:07.980]  That was the excuse to build it, but it goes all the way out to Colorado Springs, which is the alternate government in a nuclear war and COG.
[03:27:08.500 --> 03:27:09.121]  Continental government.
[03:27:09.141 --> 03:27:10.262]  So this is all declassified.
[03:27:10.702 --> 03:27:12.063]  That's the real capital now.
[03:27:12.403 --> 03:27:14.425]  The alternate capital is Colorado Springs.
[03:27:14.845 --> 03:27:15.466]  Oh my goodness.
[03:27:15.526 --> 03:27:17.988]  It's like an hour or half an hour, whatever it is, from Denver.
[03:27:18.208 --> 03:27:19.490]  That's like 60 miles.
[03:27:19.530 --> 03:27:20.992]  I mean, it takes an hour to get there.
[03:27:21.433 --> 03:27:21.974]  It's not far.
[03:27:22.334 --> 03:27:24.818]  But they're putting up signs on these walls.
[03:27:24.878 --> 03:27:25.940]  It's like, what are we doing here?
[03:27:26.320 --> 03:27:28.704]  We're making Denver a better airport for everybody.
[03:27:29.084 --> 03:27:32.009]  We've got a secret underground government base.
[03:27:35.110 --> 03:27:36.611]  Guys, pull up the headlines as he mentions it.
[03:27:36.631 --> 03:27:40.553]  It was, uh, Denver Airport Counters Conspiracy Theorists.
[03:27:40.773 --> 03:27:41.354]  Yeah.
[03:27:41.374 --> 03:27:42.214]  What does that even mean?
[03:27:42.494 --> 03:27:46.596]  See, they don't have to say that they lied about it because it's on the walls there.
[03:27:46.636 --> 03:27:52.279]  It's like, underground government base, or they're, you know, hiding the lizard people in the tunnels.
[03:27:52.320 --> 03:27:55.121]  I mean, they're making fun of it, but one of those things... Yeah, why are they doing that?
[03:27:55.301 --> 03:27:56.362]  One of those things is true.
[03:27:56.642 --> 03:28:00.724]  So they can say, we told everybody what we were doing and nobody believes it, right?
[03:28:00.784 --> 03:28:03.726]  So anyways, wild stuff happening there, but then...
[03:28:04.486 --> 03:28:10.167]  March 6th of 2023, to continue on with this timeline, Bank for International Settlements Project Icebreaker.
[03:28:10.747 --> 03:28:11.807]  What's that all about?
[03:28:11.848 --> 03:28:19.889]  That says, the ability to not authorize bank wires if the use of funds does not match up with their ideology.
[03:28:19.949 --> 03:28:27.611]  Meaning, if you wanted to send me money... So the Federal Reserve is saying, and the WF is saying, if we don't agree with you, we don't let you transfer money.
[03:28:27.871 --> 03:28:28.131]  Correct.
[03:28:28.151 --> 03:28:29.371]  It's all in the documents.
[03:28:29.591 --> 03:28:33.732]  In the documents, and there's a link here that you people... all you have to do is go for it.
[03:28:34.312 --> 03:28:39.473]  Go to the Bank for International Settlements, BIS.org, type in Project Icebreaker, you'll find it.
[03:28:40.173 --> 03:28:47.094]  May 31st of 2023, Bank for International Settlements Project Aurora took it one step further.
[03:28:47.114 --> 03:28:48.315]  And what is Project Aurora?
[03:28:48.735 --> 03:28:55.296]  That's real-time transaction monitoring of all transactions of all people in all banks of every country.
[03:28:55.336 --> 03:28:56.476]  That's everybody, Alex.
[03:28:56.856 --> 03:28:59.537]  And why do they need to monitor every transaction in real-time?
[03:28:59.877 --> 03:29:01.737]  Oh, to see if their ideology matches up.
[03:29:02.037 --> 03:29:02.978]  Why do they want to do that?
[03:29:03.038 --> 03:29:04.599]  So they can cut you off from buying or selling?
[03:29:04.639 --> 03:29:05.619]  In their own words!
[03:29:05.719 --> 03:29:09.021]  In their own words, this is all about people control, right?
[03:29:09.081 --> 03:29:11.443]  So then, you go to June 20th of 2023.
[03:29:11.983 --> 03:29:25.552]  Now it starts to get to, well, if we don't like you, in the blueprint of the financial monetary system, improving the old, enabling the new, unified ledger, this is the UN's blueprint, what do they say?
[03:29:25.572 --> 03:29:30.235]  A unified ledger means they can tokenize all of your assets into a packet.
[03:29:30.675 --> 03:29:32.076]  And to one like chunk.
[03:29:32.696 --> 03:29:39.400]  And in that, you can have your house, you can have your stock, your bonds, your mutual funds, your bank account, your savings accounts.
[03:29:40.121 --> 03:29:42.962]  No, and they can change it with the flip of a switch.
[03:29:43.022 --> 03:29:44.423]  They can change ownership.
[03:29:44.783 --> 03:29:45.644]  Well, good grief.
[03:29:45.904 --> 03:29:51.547]  This goes back to that law after the 2009 crisis where you become a beneficial owner.
[03:29:51.987 --> 03:29:53.368]  Now it's all making sense.
[03:29:53.708 --> 03:29:56.170]  So they're applying these laws, putting them together.
[03:29:56.730 --> 03:29:57.631]  Unified ledger.
[03:29:58.311 --> 03:30:04.615]  Applies to beneficial ownership where you don't own anything and you're gonna like it in their words, right?
[03:30:04.695 --> 03:30:29.028]   So so there's where we are there now, June 27th through 29th of 2023 During the 14th annual meeting of the new champions in Tianjin, China Cornell University professor Aswar Prasad shared his thoughts on the impending disappearance of physical currency they're bragging about all of this right so now What are future dates coming up?
[03:30:29.589 --> 03:30:42.117]  Future dates, September 15th of 2024, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres' vision for the future, global biometric ID tied to all bank accounts.
[03:30:42.737 --> 03:30:51.339]  So now all bank accounts are going to be digital, tied up to you, your biometric, whether it's a fingerprint, whether it's whatever, eye, retinal scan, we don't know.
[03:30:51.959 --> 03:31:02.462]  And then you go to September 22nd through 24th of 2024, that's this year, UN pact for the future, this is the date the globalists want to share their commenced plan to the world.
[03:31:02.882 --> 03:31:05.223]  So their timeline is established.
[03:31:05.763 --> 03:31:08.085]  We are just repeating it, right?
[03:31:08.105 --> 03:31:10.267]  We're just repeating and sharing that news.
[03:31:10.307 --> 03:31:15.151]  So, as a theologian, you know, as a, you know, having my PhD in theology, Alex, I look at this.
[03:31:15.671 --> 03:31:23.277]  Revelation 13, 17 says, in those days, you know, no man, woman, or child will be able to buy or sell unless they have the mark, you know.
[03:31:23.658 --> 03:31:24.579]  So, what is that?
[03:31:25.259 --> 03:31:28.921]  It's like theologians throughout time are saying, what is the Mark of the Beast?
[03:31:29.061 --> 03:31:29.341]  The 666?
[03:31:29.701 --> 03:31:30.141]  What is it?
[03:31:30.561 --> 03:31:35.223]  Well, to me, as I read this, they're saying that this is probably the Mark of the Beast.
[03:31:35.283 --> 03:31:41.246]  If you can't buy or sell without matching up with their ideology, then they can cut you off.
[03:31:41.626 --> 03:31:42.807]  Doesn't that sound like...
[03:31:43.527 --> 03:31:49.331]  Revelation 13, 17, Alex, where it's like... Well, the Bible says you've got to worship the beast to get the mark.
[03:31:49.351 --> 03:31:51.612]  It's not like you just accept it, you've got to worship it.
[03:31:51.912 --> 03:31:52.092]  Right.
[03:31:52.232 --> 03:31:54.214]  Which means it's tracking everything you do, you've got to merge with it.
[03:31:54.454 --> 03:31:54.634]  Yes.
[03:31:55.054 --> 03:32:02.899]  So here's where I have a message of hope in this, because people freak out and say, Kirk, Central Bank Digital Currency, it's the mark of the beast, this is the end of time, this is terrible.
[03:32:02.919 --> 03:32:07.502]  It's like, does that verse actually say that it's the only game in town?
[03:32:07.742 --> 03:32:08.322]  No, it doesn't.
[03:32:08.342 --> 03:32:09.883]  It just says, don't take the mark.
[03:32:10.184 --> 03:32:10.424]  Right?
[03:32:10.804 --> 03:32:12.445]  So... It says, run to the hills, the country.
[03:32:12.625 --> 03:32:22.653]  Yeah, so here's where I think, knowing how God is, how he's a God of love, he's a God of grace, he's a God of mercy, he's a God of choice, right?
[03:32:22.693 --> 03:32:23.934]  He always gives us cheat sheets.
[03:32:24.194 --> 03:32:26.536]  He always gives us a plan for success.
[03:32:26.576 --> 03:32:33.582]  You know, Jeremiah 29 says, you know, my plan for you is to have a successful future, not to harm you, right?
[03:32:33.642 --> 03:32:37.705]  So here's where he would not put in his word anything where we could...
[03:32:37.705 --> 03:32:39.546]  But we better find out the plan and follow it.
[03:32:39.566 --> 03:32:42.687]  We better figure it out, because... How powerful is it?
[03:32:42.707 --> 03:32:47.770]  Because I already know God, I already know the Holy Spirit, I already... God's given me psychic dreams and things that come true.
[03:32:48.090 --> 03:32:49.791]  Like, hey, I'm, like, literally, like, I'm real.
[03:32:49.811 --> 03:32:50.731]  I already know that.
[03:32:51.051 --> 03:32:52.752]  But it's all being fulfilled!
[03:32:52.852 --> 03:32:54.013]  I mean, it's wild!
[03:32:54.833 --> 03:32:55.553]  It is!
[03:32:55.934 --> 03:33:02.877]  So, knowing God the way that you and I do, and your viewers out there, it's like, He gives us a choice, always.
[03:33:03.477 --> 03:33:06.579]  As a Christian, you can accept Jesus or reject Him.
[03:33:07.247 --> 03:33:11.710]  You know, benefits for accepting curses, you know, or problems.
[03:33:12.511 --> 03:33:14.632]  You can sin or you cannot sin.
[03:33:15.193 --> 03:33:15.393]  Right?
[03:33:15.573 --> 03:33:19.296]  Or, in this Mark of the Beast thing, you can either take it or you don't.
[03:33:19.736 --> 03:33:22.718]  See, what is the plan if you don't take it?
[03:33:22.738 --> 03:33:25.620]  Well, this is where I think states' rights are coming in.
[03:33:25.660 --> 03:33:27.001]  You know, you go down to the grass patch.
[03:33:27.021 --> 03:33:28.262]  Oh, there's going to be major remnants everywhere.
[03:33:28.562 --> 03:33:34.433]  Major remnants everywhere, like Texas, like Oklahoma, state chartered central banks backed by gold.
[03:33:34.473 --> 03:33:37.839]  And that's why the globalists admit Christians are their main threat, because they're going to reject it.
[03:33:38.179 --> 03:33:39.521]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:33:39.602 --> 03:33:40.423]  And what did...
[03:33:41.786 --> 03:33:44.648]  What did Christine Lagarde say last week?
[03:33:45.028 --> 03:33:55.696]  She was spouting off about Trump saying Trump is the biggest fear of the globalists because if he gets back in and the globalists... That's out of the EU.
[03:33:55.756 --> 03:33:56.836]  Yes.
[03:33:57.016 --> 03:33:59.118]  So they're afraid of Trump because why?
[03:33:59.458 --> 03:34:00.959]  He's not part of the globalist system.
[03:34:01.500 --> 03:34:05.722]  He's not just going to... He said I'll shut down central bank digital currencies.
[03:34:06.003 --> 03:34:07.564]  He said that exactly.
[03:34:07.664 --> 03:34:09.265]  So my first act is I'm killing it.
[03:34:09.505 --> 03:34:10.426]  Yep.
[03:34:10.587 --> 03:34:12.489]  So here's why they are so afraid.
[03:34:12.789 --> 03:34:14.151]  They want the system to come in.
[03:34:14.231 --> 03:34:14.812]  And you know what?
[03:34:15.373 --> 03:34:17.336]  I think that they will get it, Alex.
[03:34:17.436 --> 03:34:18.377]  I think this is going to come in.
[03:34:18.417 --> 03:34:18.777]  At some point.
[03:34:19.258 --> 03:34:19.759]  At some point.
[03:34:19.799 --> 03:34:24.785]  But what's going to run... Well, you're a Bible, you're a theologian, I'm not, but there's many Antichrist spirits.
[03:34:24.805 --> 03:34:25.667]  There's finally the one.
[03:34:25.707 --> 03:34:25.947]  Yes.
[03:34:26.007 --> 03:34:26.868]  It keeps trying.
[03:34:27.649 --> 03:34:33.852]  It looks like we lose for a while, but no, we're pre-positioned that once people finally see it all happen, then the greatest revival ever happens.
[03:34:34.172 --> 03:34:35.512]  Greatest revival ever.
[03:34:35.852 --> 03:34:41.535]  And here's where I think there's going to be parallel systems, gold-backed currency, using silver as barter.
[03:34:41.615 --> 03:34:44.256]  And I agree, gold, silver, but also farming, friends, family.
[03:34:44.416 --> 03:34:44.956]  All of that.
[03:34:45.276 --> 03:34:46.357]  That's going to be pure gold.
[03:34:46.917 --> 03:34:53.443]  So I do think that they are going to get their way in part, but there's going to be parallel systems for us to thrive and succeed.
[03:34:53.824 --> 03:34:55.525]  And this is why I... Well that's the great evil.
[03:34:55.565 --> 03:34:56.246]  You're a theologian.
[03:34:56.266 --> 03:34:59.409]  I don't attack Christians that believe in a pre-tribulation.
[03:34:59.689 --> 03:35:00.470]  I hope that's the case.
[03:35:00.530 --> 03:35:02.051]  So I'm not judging them.
[03:35:02.071 --> 03:35:02.952]  They get so mad when I do this.
[03:35:02.972 --> 03:35:04.433]  But I can read Revelation.
[03:35:04.454 --> 03:35:08.717]  It says the beast wages war against the saints and overcomes them for a very short time.
[03:35:09.518 --> 03:35:13.120]  And so, it's like you're getting your ass kicked in the fifth round, you win in the twelfth.
[03:35:14.241 --> 03:35:19.363]  Regardless, we're here to challenge this, but the average Christian says, I don't care, I'll be taken care of.
[03:35:19.724 --> 03:35:26.647]  Well, when in history would Jesus or the prophets before him, did God not put his people in the way to decide who they were?
[03:35:26.667 --> 03:35:29.789]  I mean, I just don't see us perfectly not having to confront evil.
[03:35:31.172 --> 03:35:38.835]  Well, he never said it was going to be easy, and I believe that God cares more about our eternity than he does our comfort level, right?
[03:35:39.215 --> 03:35:41.756]  And we have to ask ourselves this very critical question.
[03:35:41.776 --> 03:35:45.038]  Well, it's a test before we get boosted up to the f***ing heaven with God.
[03:35:45.078 --> 03:35:46.198]  We better prove ourselves.
[03:35:46.218 --> 03:35:52.341]  We better prove ourselves, and we have to ask ourselves every day, like I know you do, it's like, why am I here?
[03:35:53.061 --> 03:35:53.241]  Right?
[03:35:53.441 --> 03:35:57.102]  We are called to be light in this world and cast out the darkness, right?
[03:35:57.222 --> 03:36:04.364]  And using that Holy Spirit empowerment and the courage and the creativity and the boldness and the wisdom that comes from that.
[03:36:04.884 --> 03:36:06.085]  But we are here for a reason.
[03:36:06.125 --> 03:36:10.106]  We weren't created 400 years ago or 400 years from now.
[03:36:10.326 --> 03:36:13.607]  We're right here, right now, and we've got all this garbage happening.
[03:36:13.647 --> 03:36:14.027]  No, I agree.
[03:36:14.047 --> 03:36:15.327]  So what is the average Christian?
[03:36:15.347 --> 03:36:19.028]  Well, there's world government, Antichrist, and they're not raptured out.
[03:36:19.108 --> 03:36:22.169]  What are they going to think and do when they're like sitting there in the middle of this?
[03:36:23.117 --> 03:36:25.598]  They're going to say the devil's the Christ and bow down to him.
[03:36:25.858 --> 03:36:27.619]  Yeah, I mean, that's probably what they're going to do.
[03:36:27.679 --> 03:36:33.262]  But what we have to do is spread this message far and wide, like what you're doing every single day.
[03:36:33.722 --> 03:36:34.783]  I mean, this is your calling.
[03:36:34.823 --> 03:36:35.483]  It's your anointing.
[03:36:35.523 --> 03:36:36.464]  It's your gifting, Alex.
[03:36:37.444 --> 03:36:38.705]  Ours is on the financial side.
[03:36:38.745 --> 03:36:42.507]  And I want to bring peace in the midst of the storm to people's financial lives.
[03:36:43.027 --> 03:36:49.832]  Right, so there's a story in the Gospels where there's this raging sea, this storm on the Sea of Galilee, right?
[03:36:49.872 --> 03:37:00.439]  And Jesus is out there walking on water, and so for all of you people who read the Bible, you know the story, but Peter wakes up in the midst of the storm and he's out there and says, Jesus, you're walking on water, what are you doing out there?
[03:37:00.839 --> 03:37:01.960]  And Jesus says, come to me.
[03:37:02.820 --> 03:37:03.821]  So what did he do?
[03:37:04.061 --> 03:37:05.642]  He starts walking on water, too.
[03:37:05.702 --> 03:37:05.902]  Why?
[03:37:05.942 --> 03:37:08.523]  Because he was focused on the solution, not the storm.
[03:37:08.883 --> 03:37:10.844]  But human nature, he starts to get scared.
[03:37:11.084 --> 03:37:13.905]  He looks at the waves around him, and he starts to sink.
[03:37:14.046 --> 03:37:14.266]  Why?
[03:37:14.326 --> 03:37:16.447]  Because he took his eyes off the solution.
[03:37:16.867 --> 03:37:23.370]  I think that story is a story for all of us today where we can say, regardless, God's real, just trust in God, and it's going to be incredible.
[03:37:23.510 --> 03:37:28.656]  Most of America and every client that calls me is basically gripped and paralyzed with fear, Alex.
[03:37:29.137 --> 03:37:30.659]  And fear does one of two things.
[03:37:30.739 --> 03:37:33.382]  It causes you to not act or it causes you to make a wrong decision.
[03:37:33.762 --> 03:37:33.923]  Right?
[03:37:33.963 --> 03:37:37.347]  So let that spirit of fear sink to the pit where it belongs.
[03:37:37.767 --> 03:37:41.431]  Well, God doesn't give us a spirit of fear, but a spirit of overcoming and victory.
[03:37:41.451 --> 03:37:41.712]  Sound mind.
[03:37:42.813 --> 03:37:45.813]  and judgment and sound mind.
[03:37:45.813 --> 03:37:50.173]   And with that comes creativity and wisdom and discernment and boldness and all of that.
[03:37:50.173 --> 03:37:53.692]  So most of America right now is focused on the storm.
[03:37:53.692 --> 03:37:55.093]  Don't focus on the storm.
[03:37:55.093 --> 03:37:57.292]  I want to encourage you, focus on the solution.
[03:37:57.292 --> 03:38:02.612]   Financially, I believe the solution rests in precious metals because you're out of that mark
[03:38:02.612 --> 03:38:03.492]  of the beast system.
[03:38:03.492 --> 03:38:06.012]  You're not a digital slave in their digital world.
[03:38:06.012 --> 03:38:07.012]  God created it.
[03:38:07.012 --> 03:38:09.052]  Families of farming, gold, silver.
[03:38:09.052 --> 03:38:09.893]  All of it.
[03:38:09.893 --> 03:38:14.852]  In closing, Dr. Elliott, it's really great to have you here.
[03:38:14.622 --> 03:38:15.323]  You need to pitch it.
[03:38:15.343 --> 03:38:15.763]  You don't do it.
[03:38:15.783 --> 03:38:23.386]  You've got great gold and silver bullion, great advice, five-star ratings everywhere, and a system where it's like nobody has even one star.
[03:38:23.686 --> 03:38:24.246]  We love you.
[03:38:24.486 --> 03:38:27.908]  Closing five-minute statement on the economy, the world, and whatever else people need to know.
[03:38:29.431 --> 03:38:30.951]  You know, don't operate out of fear.
[03:38:31.332 --> 03:38:31.932]  Do not.
[03:38:32.112 --> 03:38:33.952]  And so that means, what is fear going to do?
[03:38:33.992 --> 03:38:34.973]  It's going to cause you not to act.
[03:38:35.013 --> 03:38:35.893]  I've never done gold before.
[03:38:35.913 --> 03:38:36.533]  I've never done silver.
[03:38:36.553 --> 03:38:37.353]  I don't know what's going on.
[03:38:37.893 --> 03:38:40.974]  But the stuff that we talked about today, Alex, is real.
[03:38:41.294 --> 03:38:42.075]  It's happening.
[03:38:42.495 --> 03:38:46.836]  And you have to act to take advantage of it so it doesn't take advantage of you.
[03:38:47.336 --> 03:38:54.238]  So I encourage you to call us or go to kepm.com forward slash gold.
[03:38:54.818 --> 03:39:01.845]  Or call our office at 720-605-3900 and just say, Alex sent me, right?
[03:39:01.905 --> 03:39:04.188]  And so, and what do we do?
[03:39:04.328 --> 03:39:06.910]  We are going to hold your hand through the economy.
[03:39:07.231 --> 03:39:10.814]  We're going to get you into tangible assets, bullion.
[03:39:10.874 --> 03:39:15.159]  Remember what I said earlier, not all gold, not all silver are created equal.
[03:39:15.539 --> 03:39:17.021]  People are being overcharged.
[03:39:17.561 --> 03:39:22.624]  They're being abused, literally abused, going into something that's unsuitable for them.
[03:39:23.084 --> 03:39:30.149]  And so if you think that that's you, simply email us at Ashley at KEPM.com.
[03:39:30.209 --> 03:39:31.029]  She's our CEO.
[03:39:31.349 --> 03:39:35.292]  And send us a copy of your invoice so we can possibly help.
[03:39:35.312 --> 03:39:36.312]  People are insane.
[03:39:36.773 --> 03:39:37.893]  They're insane if they don't go with you.
[03:39:38.274 --> 03:39:40.815]  Ten years not a gold sponsor, folks, because I couldn't find a good one.
[03:39:41.616 --> 03:39:45.658]  Because I'm not going to sit there and sell you numismatics with a 100% markup.
[03:39:45.698 --> 03:39:46.218]  I'm not doing it.
[03:39:47.557 --> 03:39:51.278]  Yeah, I mean, there's really, you never want to go into that stuff, ever.
[03:39:52.298 --> 03:40:02.741]  Low cost, and we're in silver right now, because it's outperforming gold, and we can take advantage... You were on months ago saying silver's about to go up, and it did!
[03:40:03.041 --> 03:40:03.362]  It did!
[03:40:04.362 --> 03:40:07.943]  And we're going to see even more because of the manufacturing demand.
[03:40:08.223 --> 03:40:09.843]  Alex, this is what's wild to me.
[03:40:10.424 --> 03:40:25.499]   In the worst global economy we've seen in over 40 years, maybe ever, The demand for silver is through the roof because it's used in electronics, it's used in EVs, electric vehicles, solar, fuel cell technology, all of it.
[03:40:25.659 --> 03:40:27.122]  Everything that we're hearing on a daily basis.
[03:40:27.142 --> 03:40:27.923]  Industrial metal.
[03:40:28.343 --> 03:40:30.807]  Industrial metal used for manufacturing, needed.
[03:40:31.227 --> 03:40:32.929]  Manufacturing jobs are in decline.
[03:40:33.229 --> 03:40:34.530]  Bank failures are coming.
[03:40:34.871 --> 03:40:41.397]  What we didn't even get into, which we can talk about next time we do a show, state pensions are running out of money.
[03:40:41.677 --> 03:40:50.245]  So if you've got a retirement and a state pension, it's like, oh my word, call us because we can possibly roll that out into an IRA denominated in gold and silver.
[03:40:50.365 --> 03:40:50.845]  Let's do this.
[03:40:50.925 --> 03:40:53.588]  I'm going to edit this down to an hour for my weekday show.
[03:40:54.108 --> 03:40:56.831]  Come on the 15 minutes before it and we'll talk about the state pension funds.
[03:40:57.011 --> 03:41:03.679]  Because that's a question, without you bringing it up, our bankruptcy of some US states in the future, that's being talked about in the Wall Street Journal.
[03:41:04.080 --> 03:41:04.240]  Yeah.
[03:41:05.542 --> 03:41:09.206]  I mean, states are going bankrupt, pensions are going bankrupt.
[03:41:09.547 --> 03:41:14.393]  See, to me, a state pension is like a legalized Ponzi scheme.
[03:41:15.365 --> 03:41:15.786]  Literally.
[03:41:15.806 --> 03:41:18.568]  It goes back to Jimmy Hoffa and the Teamsters and all that.
[03:41:18.969 --> 03:41:20.670]  Because we've got the graying of America.
[03:41:20.710 --> 03:41:26.236]  More people are going into retirement that are going to receive benefits than people that are paying into the system.
[03:41:26.276 --> 03:41:28.198]  That's what COVID's about, to get rid of the old folks.
[03:41:28.218 --> 03:41:30.300]  Dr. Kirk Elliott, thank you so much for the time.
[03:41:30.360 --> 03:41:31.581]  Thanks for coming down from Denver.
[03:41:32.301 --> 03:41:35.822]   Your city's as overrun as mine is, so we're both in the same hell pit here.
[03:41:35.822 --> 03:41:37.101]  But God bless you.
[03:41:37.101 --> 03:41:38.140]  Thank you so much.
[03:41:38.140 --> 03:41:39.902]  K.E.P.M. dot com.
[03:41:39.902 --> 03:41:44.101]  Forced by Skoll or call 720-605-3900.
[03:41:44.101 --> 03:41:44.980]  Thank you so much, sir.
[03:41:44.980 --> 03:41:45.461]  Great job.
[03:41:45.461 --> 03:41:46.582]  Thank you so much.
[03:41:46.582 --> 03:41:47.140]  Thank you.
[03:41:47.140 --> 03:41:47.701]  Bye bye.
[03:41:47.701 --> 03:41:53.582]   All I do is research, research trends, and I see what is having the best effects,
[03:41:53.582 --> 03:41:55.422]  what is having the best reviews.
[03:41:55.422 --> 03:42:00.181]   So a couple of years ago, I saw different formulas out there that are known to
[03:42:00.181 --> 03:42:05.502]   create compounds in the blood that flush out the body and that create what they
[03:42:05.502 --> 03:42:09.740]   call vasodilation, opening up the arteries, opening up the veins, which is
[03:42:09.740 --> 03:42:13.380]   so important, not just for young people, but especially older people.
[03:42:13.380 --> 03:42:16.661]   And so then I had Dr. Judy Mickiewicz, who's such a renowned scientist and a
[03:42:17.521 --> 03:42:18.681]  She said, I love your formula.
[03:42:18.701 --> 03:42:19.582]  It's one of the best out there.
[03:42:20.142 --> 03:42:23.043]  And so this product, Nitric Boost, became a bestseller.
[03:42:23.503 --> 03:42:27.105]  Well, we decided to soup it up and make it even stronger.
[03:42:27.785 --> 03:42:29.946]  So it's the original formula, just a little bit stronger.
[03:42:30.526 --> 03:42:34.408]  Now Nitric Boost is available at InfoWardStore.com.
[03:42:34.808 --> 03:42:38.448]   Because the problem was the supplier we had couldn't supply enough.
[03:42:38.448 --> 03:42:42.948]   We were selling out very, very quickly, but now we've got a big supply of nitric
[03:42:42.948 --> 03:42:46.368]  boost in stock, ready to ship at info war store.com.
[03:42:46.368 --> 03:42:52.568]   And when I talk about vasodilation and the nitric oxide is a potent vasco
[03:42:52.568 --> 03:42:56.128]  dilator, many can help relax and widen blood vessels.
[03:42:56.128 --> 03:42:59.288]   This can lead to increased blood flow and improve circulation, which is
[03:42:59.288 --> 03:43:01.208]  critical to various body functions.
[03:43:01.208 --> 03:43:03.728]  So ladies and gentlemen, it funds the info war.
[03:43:04.088 --> 03:43:05.687]  It's an amazing product.
[03:43:05.745 --> 03:43:15.907]  So we have the new and improved, super powerful Nitric Boost back in stock, ready to ship for 40% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:43:16.227 --> 03:43:17.227]  This is a true win-win.
[03:43:17.627 --> 03:43:22.628]  This has the very same effect as some of the male enhancement things out there, but totally naturally.
[03:43:23.088 --> 03:43:27.609]  This does it in a natural way, and not that I need those products, but I've tried them.
[03:43:27.629 --> 03:43:28.469]  I've been to the doctor.
[03:43:28.769 --> 03:43:32.910]  They give you a prescription of it, and I've tried the top brands, the two top brands.
[03:43:33.810 --> 03:43:35.631]  And I'm not even trying to say that's what this is.
[03:43:35.971 --> 03:43:36.812]  That's off-label.
[03:43:36.852 --> 03:43:38.033]  That's not what this is even for.
[03:43:38.333 --> 03:43:39.153]  This is a supplement.
[03:43:39.553 --> 03:43:43.115]  But it is incredible what it does for your body.
[03:43:43.436 --> 03:43:47.778]  So get this amazing product now in stock, ready to ship.

[03:43:52.801 --> 03:43:54.041]  You fund the InfoWar.
[03:43:54.322 --> 03:43:55.442]  It's so good for your body.
[03:43:55.862 --> 03:43:56.643]  Get it while you can.
[03:43:57.183 --> 03:43:59.005]  Well, nitric oxide is a key.
[03:43:59.085 --> 03:44:01.146]  It's made by our own bodies again.
[03:44:01.546 --> 03:44:05.750]  It's made by L-citrulline and L-arginine, the amino acids.
[03:44:06.070 --> 03:44:06.990]  So we're fed.
[03:44:07.391 --> 03:44:09.352]  You can get it from beet powder and other things.
[03:44:09.472 --> 03:44:11.734]  The nitric oxide relaxes.
[03:44:12.094 --> 03:44:15.256]  The endothelium, the vasculature, it relaxes the vein.
[03:44:15.577 --> 03:44:17.358]  It's a natural blood pressure.
[03:44:17.398 --> 03:44:18.899]  In fact, I use the two.
[03:44:18.999 --> 03:44:21.521]  Your Info Wars, I keep that on my shelf.
[03:44:21.882 --> 03:44:26.065]  And I feed myself the Cardio Miracle, which is straight food.
[03:44:26.425 --> 03:44:28.306]  It's a different formulation than that one.
[03:44:28.326 --> 03:44:30.768]  And the two together are a one-two punch.
[03:44:30.808 --> 03:44:35.212]  So you get in your food the ability to make what you need and no more.
[03:44:35.392 --> 03:44:36.413]  You've looked at our formula.
[03:44:36.473 --> 03:44:36.913]  You like it?
[03:44:38.015 --> 03:44:38.836]  I did, and I do.
[03:44:39.157 --> 03:44:39.417]  Yes.
[03:44:40.478 --> 03:44:41.599]  I'm not a scientist like you.
[03:44:41.619 --> 03:44:44.002]  What do these compounds do, creating nitrous oxide?
[03:44:44.022 --> 03:44:44.583]  What does it do?
[03:44:45.083 --> 03:44:49.709]  It relaxes the vasculature, so the clot will go through and not restrict.
[03:44:50.049 --> 03:44:51.631]  It allows it to relax.
[03:44:51.711 --> 03:45:00.957]   It lowers the blood pressure, has the toxic Um, synthetic lipid nanoparticles similar to the one in the COVID shot.
[03:45:01.097 --> 03:45:06.199]  We saw athletes dropping dead on the field, um, passing out, falling down, all the things.
[03:45:06.239 --> 03:45:07.959]  Why is it particularly the athletes?
[03:45:08.399 --> 03:45:12.020]  They're operating at such a high level in their mitochondria.
[03:45:12.060 --> 03:45:19.303]   This is an energy production, oxygen, um, necessary disease because athletes are running They're constricted.
[03:45:19.343 --> 03:45:32.213]  They're working so that the blood flows and it doesn't flow, which is why your nitric oxide product, that new product, I hope you'll show it because that's a very important thing to have for acute events.
[03:45:32.293 --> 03:45:38.739]  It dissolves under the tongue, gives you an instant relaxing of your endothelium, your vasculature.
[03:45:38.799 --> 03:45:43.923]  So get Nitric Boost today at infowarestore.com for 40% off.
[03:45:44.323 --> 03:45:45.024]  Get it while you can.
