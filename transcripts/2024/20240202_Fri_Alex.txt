[00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.367]  InfoWars.
[00:00:05.427 --> 00:00:07.728]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:07.748 --> 00:00:09.268]  It's Friday, February 2nd, 2024.
[00:00:33.337 --> 00:00:40.323]  And we're about to break one of the biggest stories in the 29-plus year history of this operation.
[00:00:41.604 --> 00:00:42.085]  Folks, no.
[00:00:42.105 --> 00:00:43.626]  We're not about hype.
[00:00:44.287 --> 00:00:46.769]  When I tell you something's big, it's big.
[00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.210]  We deliver.
[00:00:48.911 --> 00:00:49.351]  We are.
[00:00:50.052 --> 00:00:51.413]  Tomorrow's next day.
[00:00:51.513 --> 00:00:52.013]  Ha, ha, ha!
[00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:52.974]  The universe is big.
[00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.380]  Globalists want to pose like they're God.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:12.501]  But they're not even connected to God.
[00:01:12.521 --> 00:01:16.742]  276 days, 12 hours, 58 minutes, 55 seconds.
[00:01:17.242 --> 00:01:19.423]  The most important election in world history.
[00:01:19.883 --> 00:01:27.344]  And the corrupt, dying establishment is running around like a chicken with its head cut off that just took five gallons of PCP.
[00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:37.377]  Well, you talk about the Great Awakening, and it's not just in the talk show hosts, and all the most popular talk show hosts in the world now are anti-New World Order.
[00:01:38.635 --> 00:01:39.376]  Everybody's joining us.
[00:01:40.376 --> 00:01:41.297]  It's in government.
[00:01:41.417 --> 00:01:42.497]  It's in corporations.
[00:01:42.718 --> 00:01:43.518]  It's everywhere.
[00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.902]  All right, so we've been pinned down because of financial issues, as you know, the last few years.
[00:01:49.402 --> 00:01:51.303]  You know, the border like two or three times a year.
[00:01:51.663 --> 00:01:58.207]  And I want to have people at the border full time because the Border Patrol, the National Guard, the State Guard, they're all on our side.
[00:01:58.528 --> 00:02:00.949]  The feds down there that are rank and file are on our side.
[00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.210]  I'd say 95% of them.
[00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.192]  It is a target-rich environment, to tell the truth.
[00:02:06.221 --> 00:02:15.644]  So, I finally, in the bankruptcy, and moving forward, we're doing better here, got funding to send a couple security guys, a couple reporters, camera people down to the border.
[00:02:16.685 --> 00:02:25.308]  But it's our security people, particularly Tim Enloe, that has... This guy, he never talks about his military service, but the Army, the Marines...
[00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:34.852]  Blackwater, Austin police officers, SWAT team, three-letter agencies, federal marshal, air marshal.
[00:02:35.393 --> 00:02:35.893]  He's done it all.
[00:02:35.913 --> 00:02:37.133]  He wants to know everything.
[00:02:37.654 --> 00:02:41.696]  He trains state police and local police, SWAT team training.
[00:02:41.736 --> 00:02:43.736]  He's like the guy that they can send in for that.
[00:02:44.057 --> 00:02:45.417]  He's like a really amazing guy.
[00:02:45.437 --> 00:02:46.478]  He's a good friend of mine.
[00:02:46.838 --> 00:02:47.898]  Head of security from Fort Worth.
[00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:50.700]  Enloe has all these contacts.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.522]  And he went down there and...
[00:02:56.877 --> 00:02:59.199]  The Border Patrol, all of them, just said, here's everything.
[00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:00.760]  The documents, everything.
[00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:04.163]  And they said, we're really concerned about a false flag right now.
[00:03:04.863 --> 00:03:07.445]  We think Biden's about to stage a terror attack down here.
[00:03:07.465 --> 00:03:09.106]  I mean, this is us.
[00:03:09.346 --> 00:03:10.627]  This is our guys in meetings.
[00:03:10.707 --> 00:03:14.010]  And let me tell you, the meetings I have with NLO is like with high-level federal judges.
[00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.613]  I'm not going to say how high-level, because it's as high as you can go, other than like the Supreme Court.
[00:03:19.814 --> 00:03:21.436]  We're talking the people.
[00:03:22.336 --> 00:03:24.057]  And so they're like, when are you coming?
[00:03:24.097 --> 00:03:24.717]  When are you coming?
[00:03:25.037 --> 00:03:26.898]  And we need to be down there permanently.
[00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:34.241]  And Drew Hernandez relieves our team with his team on Saturday, and then I'm going to go, and Owen's going to go.
[00:03:35.202 --> 00:03:39.344]  Owen, because of his probation from January 6th, can't go until like the 23rd of February.
[00:03:39.364 --> 00:03:40.084]  But I'm going.
[00:03:40.124 --> 00:03:40.844]  We're all going.
[00:03:41.244 --> 00:03:41.965]  It's all going down.
[00:03:43.044 --> 00:03:47.506]  And so we're going to break some massive, massive news.
[00:03:47.566 --> 00:03:48.806]  I talk about a Rosetta Stone.
[00:03:49.446 --> 00:03:50.427]  I talk about a keyhole.
[00:03:50.767 --> 00:03:56.609]  You know, they couldn't decipher the Egyptian hieroglyphics until 150 years ago or whatever it was.
[00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:58.389]  You can look it up, maybe 200 years ago.
[00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.171]  They found the Rosetta Stone that was the decoder.
[00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:07.913]  It was like the stone for a classroom for kids how to read a hieroglyph.
[00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:14.790]  And then once you have the Rosetta Stone, that's what they call that big computer program that teaches you any language, the Rosetta program.
[00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.031]  Once you've got that, you've got it all.
[00:04:17.431 --> 00:04:20.812]  This is ultra-massive news.
[00:04:22.232 --> 00:04:24.052]  How is Biden planning a civil war?
[00:04:24.492 --> 00:04:26.813]  How is he planning to stick the NSA on the American people?
[00:04:27.733 --> 00:04:29.353]  How are they planning to roll all this out?
[00:04:29.413 --> 00:04:31.374]  We now know from the feds
[00:04:32.657 --> 00:04:34.438]  Who have been briefed on all of it.
[00:04:34.658 --> 00:04:42.262]  Folks, we don't just have whistleblowers in the Border Patrol or the FBI or the State Police or the Guard.
[00:04:42.362 --> 00:04:45.103]  We have them at Fort Meade at the NSA.
[00:04:45.123 --> 00:04:46.444]  Alright?
[00:04:47.304 --> 00:04:48.525]  Yeah, the NSA.
[00:04:48.545 --> 00:04:52.747]  I mean, I'll be lucky to be alive at the end of this day.
[00:04:53.087 --> 00:04:55.408]  But we're about to drop all the data.
[00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:57.529]  Tomorrow's news today, bitches.
[00:05:02.301 --> 00:05:03.542]  Gunther in Tennessee.
[00:05:03.582 --> 00:05:04.643]  Thanks for calling, Gunther.
[00:05:04.783 --> 00:05:05.123]  Hey, Alex.
[00:05:05.323 --> 00:05:06.084]  First time caller.
[00:05:06.164 --> 00:05:08.005]  Real quick, wanted to plug your foundational energy.
[00:05:08.566 --> 00:05:09.526]  Just started taking that.
[00:05:10.187 --> 00:05:14.490]  And, boy, three pills, recommended dose, I was bouncing off the walls.
[00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.234]  But I tell you, foundational is the right name for that product because I'll cut down to one.
[00:05:20.855 --> 00:05:25.118]  It's like you have a baseline of energy that you were missing before that you got back.
[00:05:25.238 --> 00:05:25.358]  Cool.
[00:05:25.538 --> 00:05:33.760]  Well, I'm glad you mentioned that because it's methylfolate, the breakdown of folic acid, and a lot of people, particularly Europeans, don't absorb all of the folic acid.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.101]  So it's not a stimulant.
[00:05:35.321 --> 00:05:38.722]  It's a totally natural thing that boosts energy that's foundational.
[00:05:39.022 --> 00:05:41.583]  And was I lying to you or did it not work?
[00:05:42.263 --> 00:05:43.463]  No, it was top-notch.
[00:05:43.503 --> 00:05:47.144]  And I was actually taking Red Pill Plus before, and that's got a little folic acid in it.
[00:05:47.184 --> 00:05:50.965]  I think there was a little buildup from this, but the energy from this was no jitters.
[00:05:51.145 --> 00:05:52.086]  I mean, it's top-notch.
[00:05:52.106 --> 00:05:52.886]  It's a great product.
[00:05:53.305 --> 00:05:54.266]  Well, thank you so much.
[00:05:54.306 --> 00:05:58.072]  Yeah, no, folic acid's great and it's in real red pill, but some can't break it down.
[00:05:58.112 --> 00:05:59.133]  This is the breakdown of it.
[00:05:59.193 --> 00:05:59.974]  That's exactly it.
[00:06:06.323 --> 00:06:07.064]  From Farmers.
[00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:21.298]  To school teachers, to bus drivers, police officers and auto mechanics, to FBI agents and people at the NSA, America is tired of seeing this country being brought down as to be whistleblowers that bring down the New World Order.
[00:06:21.658 --> 00:06:23.640]  We have NSA whistleblowers.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.941]  We have Border Patrol whistleblowers.
[00:06:25.981 --> 00:06:27.342]  We have FBI whistleblowers.
[00:06:27.422 --> 00:06:28.743]  We've got it all.
[00:06:29.594 --> 00:06:30.175]  Today.
[00:06:31.115 --> 00:06:32.296]  That's why you kept us on air.
[00:06:32.696 --> 00:06:34.178]  That's why we stayed in attack formation.
[00:06:34.858 --> 00:06:38.881]  Now, here's my earlier report I just put out 15 minutes ago on X, Alex Jones.
[00:06:39.562 --> 00:06:46.507]  I'll give you all the latest details after this and Tim Inlow, who's been down there on the ground at the border with Chase Geyser.
[00:06:46.928 --> 00:06:49.910]  He doesn't even want to be on air, but this is so technical.
[00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:50.731]  He's going to come on air.
[00:06:51.191 --> 00:06:54.253]  And Tim has worked for most of the federal agencies.
[00:06:54.273 --> 00:06:54.874]  He's done it all.
[00:06:55.354 --> 00:06:57.576]  He's a really smart guy, and that's why he has these contacts.
[00:06:58.156 --> 00:06:58.577]  Stay with us.
[00:07:03.405 --> 00:07:04.206]  InfoWars.
[00:07:04.266 --> 00:07:06.367]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:07:06.387 --> 00:07:08.809]  It's Friday, February 2nd, 2024.
[00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:15.473]  We have two huge breaking stories right now that are exclusive to InfoWars.
[00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.990]  We're good to go.
[00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:29.330]  I think?
[00:07:57.173 --> 00:07:59.354]  He's one of those people that has extensive background in the government.
[00:07:59.854 --> 00:08:00.435]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:08:01.235 --> 00:08:05.297]  And he has the sources down there known to him who he met with.
[00:08:06.058 --> 00:08:19.324]  And he was shown the Homeland Security FBI memo that came through yesterday morning to the main Border Patrol facility there in Eagle Pass on the Texas-Mexico border.
[00:08:19.905 --> 00:08:25.588]  And they told them imminent threat of a white supremacist attack
[00:08:26.696 --> 00:08:27.217]  We're good to go.
[00:08:27.237 --> 00:08:27.557]  I think?
[00:08:56.004 --> 00:08:56.905]  We're good to go.
[00:09:12.993 --> 00:09:25.856]  And here is the debate going on within the Border Patrol and within Fort Meade.
[00:09:25.896 --> 00:09:28.857]  This information is directly from the NSA.
[00:09:30.777 --> 00:09:36.899]  The NSA is already very, very upset that their software was used against American citizens on January 6th.
[00:09:38.123 --> 00:09:38.803]  We're good to go.
[00:09:38.823 --> 00:09:39.484]  We're good to go.
[00:09:59.028 --> 00:09:59.668]  We're good to go.
[00:10:22.073 --> 00:10:22.493]  We're good to go.
[00:10:51.451 --> 00:10:52.672]  We're good to go.
[00:10:52.752 --> 00:10:53.433]  We're good to go.
[00:11:19.032 --> 00:11:19.933]  We're good to go.
[00:11:32.864 --> 00:11:33.585]  We're good to go.
[00:11:54.825 --> 00:12:02.852]  Obviously, again, as a chilling effect as well, so that people don't want to go out and protest and demonstrate because, quote, you're going to be put in a database.
[00:12:03.493 --> 00:12:06.335]  I totally support the convoys going down there that arrived tonight.
[00:12:06.816 --> 00:12:08.917]  I think it's great to have citizen journalists drawing attention.
[00:12:09.298 --> 00:12:12.280]  Nobody's going down there to be mean to the illegal aliens or the, quote, migrants.
[00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:16.444]  We're there to draw attention to the fact that we have human smuggling, human trafficking of children.
[00:12:17.245 --> 00:12:17.846]  We're good to go.
[00:12:32.847 --> 00:12:33.447]  We're good to go.
[00:12:33.467 --> 00:12:33.667]  I think?
[00:12:53.136 --> 00:12:55.657]  This information, this is a big, big deal.
[00:12:56.037 --> 00:13:04.620]  And the Border Patrol and other federal agents are seriously concerned that the Biden administration is attempting to set up the American people and Trump supporters right now.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.221]  But we can't just never go cover something or never have a demonstration because of that.
[00:13:08.701 --> 00:13:17.524]  This is a great awakening that our own government and our own military and our own NSA is very upset about what's going on and is giving us this information.
[00:13:17.965 --> 00:13:19.405]  So this is extremely important.
[00:13:19.565 --> 00:13:20.086]  Historical.
[00:13:20.526 --> 00:13:23.268]  Local news is now reporting on what we broke yesterday.
[00:13:23.669 --> 00:13:29.734]  They're talking to Border Patrol and saying, indeed, there has been this memo of imminent white supremacist attack.
[00:13:30.154 --> 00:13:32.056]  So this is tomorrow's news today.
[00:13:32.416 --> 00:13:36.080]  Again, if you're watching this on X right now, by the time you're watching it, we'll be live.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:41.565]  And you can go to InfoWars.com forward slash show or right on the front page of Real Alex Jones on X. And we're going to have...
[00:13:42.185 --> 00:13:48.129]  Tim Inlow and others on the broadcast giving you real-time information.
[00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:55.174]  This is about not letting the huge apparatus of foreign intelligence be used against the American people.
[00:13:55.234 --> 00:13:57.396]  This is critical to the future of our republic.
[00:13:57.616 --> 00:14:01.099]  So please share this report and please join us live today at 11 a.m.
[00:14:01.119 --> 00:14:03.540]  Central at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:14:03.741 --> 00:14:05.442]  And again, right here on X at Real Alex Jones.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.060]  We're good to go.
[00:14:36.982 --> 00:14:42.669]  To give them hundreds of millions of people that had liked or followed or supported President Trump's channel.
[00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:50.299]  That's all about a database in the NSA to link it to your face and create a chilling effect you're being watched in live time.
[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.483]  That's why they're expanding the Capitol Police all over the country.
[00:14:54.554 --> 00:14:56.115]  You say, well, we better just shut up and go away.
[00:14:56.196 --> 00:14:56.536]  No, no, no.
[00:14:56.576 --> 00:15:07.006]  This is all being done, again, to take the whole apparatus of national security, supposedly for the Chinese and the Russians and Fang Fang and Swallowswell, and turn it against us.
[00:15:09.355 --> 00:15:10.316]  We're good to go.
[00:15:38.797 --> 00:15:39.517]  We're good to go.
[00:15:58.152 --> 00:15:59.153]  We're good to go.
[00:15:59.173 --> 00:16:00.154]  We're good to go.
[00:16:23.382 --> 00:16:28.688]  We were shown the documents as well a year ago with tens of thousands of Haitians piled up in Eagle Pass.
[00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:31.391]  They put out a fake terror alert.
[00:16:31.992 --> 00:16:32.933]  The feds believe it's fake.
[00:16:33.453 --> 00:16:34.595]  We talked to them.
[00:16:34.635 --> 00:16:38.799]  It was an imminent white supremacist attack so they could use facial recognition then on the border.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.240]  We're good to go.
[00:17:10.031 --> 00:17:13.214]  And people that walked in the velvet ropes for six months to five years.
[00:17:15.095 --> 00:17:20.480]  And so they want to take this model of January 6th and expand it to everybody.
[00:17:22.281 --> 00:17:30.348]  And the feds, the rank and file, FBI, NSA, all of them are saying, Border Patrol are saying, we see what you're doing.
[00:17:31.369 --> 00:17:35.512]  And we've talked to a lot of our sources on the border.
[00:17:35.532 --> 00:17:36.273]  This is coming up.
[00:17:38.206 --> 00:17:39.907]  The police know how to spot a leftist.
[00:17:40.767 --> 00:17:41.947]  They're running their license plates.
[00:17:41.987 --> 00:17:43.668]  They're finding out who works for the NGOs.
[00:17:44.188 --> 00:17:48.589]  They've already caught at least a dozen people that are known members of NGOs.
[00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:51.690]  The police just run their plate when they look suspicious.
[00:17:52.351 --> 00:17:54.911]  And, oh, this guy is on LinkedIn.
[00:17:54.951 --> 00:17:56.132]  This guy worked for the UN.
[00:17:56.452 --> 00:17:57.672]  This guy works for Biden.
[00:17:57.692 --> 00:17:58.753]  This guy worked for Obama.
[00:17:59.073 --> 00:18:01.954]  And they're all dressed up in Trump outfits with a gun down there.
[00:18:02.774 --> 00:18:04.916]  And the cops just swarm them and start following them.
[00:18:05.436 --> 00:18:06.337]  They're not stupid.
[00:18:06.577 --> 00:18:09.119]  See, once you're aware of a false flag, it loses its power.
[00:18:10.801 --> 00:18:23.952]  So over a dozen who reported this four days ago have been identified by law enforcement who are NGO leftists posing as militias down there.
[00:18:24.747 --> 00:18:26.989]  So this isn't our Waterloo.
[00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:28.670]  This isn't us getting our ass kicked.
[00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:30.671]  Now this is our terrain.
[00:18:30.691 --> 00:18:33.673]  This isn't the capital where they can rig everything and control it.
[00:18:33.954 --> 00:18:34.974]  And we walk into a trap.
[00:18:35.074 --> 00:18:35.895]  Now we're smarter.
[00:18:36.896 --> 00:18:39.077]  And now we're identifying who they are.
[00:18:39.998 --> 00:18:41.519]  We're now running their license plates.
[00:18:41.639 --> 00:18:43.820]  We're now going, oh, that's an NGO.
[00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:44.301]  That's an NGO.
[00:18:44.321 --> 00:18:50.185]  You got a bunch of weird chicken neck pedophile looking meth head people in a restaurant.
[00:18:51.806 --> 00:18:52.647]  The cops aren't dumb.
[00:18:52.667 --> 00:18:54.188]  They look and they go, boy, that doesn't look like
[00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:58.853]  Trump supporters, I mean, you know, a group of Trump supporters looks like nice, friendly people.
[00:18:58.873 --> 00:19:01.835]  The men look like, you know, veterans, badasses.
[00:19:01.855 --> 00:19:04.597]  I mean, you just know what a Trump supporter looks like at the Texas border.
[00:19:06.879 --> 00:19:19.349]  The cops see a bunch of people pull up in Priuses and electric cars and they get out in Trump gear with their machine guns and are spouting racist crap at a Mexican food restaurant and the cops are like, we got your ass.
[00:19:19.849 --> 00:19:20.630]  Let's run that plate.
[00:19:22.702 --> 00:19:24.984]  So, we got NGOs down here.
[00:19:25.304 --> 00:19:26.645]  Good luck, dickheads.
[00:19:27.526 --> 00:19:32.629]  Because see, now we know your operation, and now your operation's blown.
[00:19:34.491 --> 00:19:39.114]  So instead of being afraid to go down there, everybody should go down there and just point cameras everywhere.
[00:19:39.855 --> 00:19:43.157]  Because this isn't one little capital a few square miles they can control.
[00:19:44.818 --> 00:19:45.699]  Or maybe a square mile.
[00:19:48.430 --> 00:20:12.189]  This is Sarah Palin and Ted Nugent and everybody in Dripping Springs last night and all these other people, thousands of trucks going down there to just peacefully sit around and barbecue and talk about America and freedom and point cameras everywhere and get everybody else to not be scared.
[00:20:12.889 --> 00:20:17.473]  I remember on the morning of January 6th, I'm going to be completely honest with you,
[00:20:19.089 --> 00:20:19.930]  Honesty is all that matters.
[00:20:21.311 --> 00:20:23.332]  I get up about 6.45, reading news.
[00:20:25.513 --> 00:20:26.254]  It was a big day.
[00:20:26.274 --> 00:20:27.995]  I don't normally drink in the morning.
[00:20:29.636 --> 00:20:35.040]  And I looked at my wife, and I said, baby, let's get a big breakfast and a couple shots of Jack Daniels.
[00:20:36.401 --> 00:20:45.587]  So I ate breakfast by 7.30, hung out with my wife a little bit, went out there, took us an hour and a half to get through the crowd just to where Trump was at, and
[00:20:48.959 --> 00:20:49.620]  But we're not...
[00:21:15.063 --> 00:21:15.844]  We're good to go.
[00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:26.518]  We're good to go.
[00:21:26.558 --> 00:21:27.218]  We're good to go.
[00:21:56.431 --> 00:22:01.433]  But once I got out of there and all the text came through, my crew's like, hey, we're down here at the Capitol.
[00:22:01.473 --> 00:22:03.054]  Looks like a setup for you to get down here.
[00:22:03.314 --> 00:22:04.315]  Looks like they're going to do something.
[00:22:04.335 --> 00:22:05.115]  Get down here and stop it.
[00:22:06.376 --> 00:22:10.638]  So as soon as I get out on Pennsylvania Avenue and run that way, it was already too late.
[00:22:11.118 --> 00:22:13.659]  We're not behind the eight ball now.
[00:22:14.059 --> 00:22:17.081]  We're watching everything they do.
[00:22:19.422 --> 00:22:21.503]  So if I was ever on a march on D.C.
[00:22:21.543 --> 00:22:24.724]  again, I sure as hell won't be eating omelets and drinking Jack Gaines.
[00:22:25.224 --> 00:22:26.125]  I apologize for that.
[00:22:27.796 --> 00:22:28.976]  I only had like one shot or something.
[00:22:28.996 --> 00:22:34.218]  The point is that I'm just having fun with my wife, enjoying myself, and just thinking, oh, the government will handle it.
[00:22:34.278 --> 00:22:40.800]  I'm going to go out and watch Trump's speech, and they claim I'm going to do some rally with him at another stage.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:46.041]  They had the permit by the Supreme Court building right there on the corner of the Capitol.
[00:22:47.662 --> 00:22:48.802]  But we walked right into that.
[00:22:49.282 --> 00:22:52.103]  But just because we walked right into that
[00:22:53.339 --> 00:22:55.981]  Doesn't mean we've got to do it over and over and over again.
[00:22:56.301 --> 00:23:06.750]  And that doesn't mean we don't then go to the border and show the illegal aliens and show the open border and show the human trafficking and show the NGOs.
[00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:08.591]  They want to intimidate you.
[00:23:08.651 --> 00:23:09.932]  No, this is our victory.
[00:23:10.513 --> 00:23:13.675]  We go down there and the Border Patrol and all of them are on our side.
[00:23:15.417 --> 00:23:19.120]  So it's a beautiful moment to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.683]  But it's also a real opportunity and also a great danger because
[00:23:24.265 --> 00:23:25.047]  Here's the big takeaway.
[00:23:27.294 --> 00:23:30.424]  Biden has put out a terror alert that we've seen
[00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:39.052]  Two days ago saying imminent terror attack on the Border Patrol and on the illegal aliens at those migrant centers.
[00:23:39.352 --> 00:23:44.313]  So they secretly shipped them all out the last few days or day and a half on buses somewhere else.
[00:23:44.953 --> 00:23:47.674]  But the Border Patrol, everybody else is like, this is crap.
[00:23:48.234 --> 00:23:49.454]  No one's even here yet.
[00:23:49.874 --> 00:23:50.575]  They all know.
[00:23:50.655 --> 00:23:54.176]  Maybe they got some meth head white supremacist who actually believes in Patriot Front.
[00:23:54.216 --> 00:23:54.616]  Who knows?
[00:23:55.516 --> 00:23:57.956]  But it's not real, folks.
[00:23:58.217 --> 00:23:59.777]  We know that intuitively.
[00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:01.399]  We're good to go.
[00:24:20.752 --> 00:24:21.293]  We're good to go.
[00:24:44.329 --> 00:24:53.795]  That comes there and run it through a database and then say if you're there protesting, you're in a database as a terrorist as an intimidation tactic down the road.
[00:24:53.976 --> 00:24:56.037]  But they didn't want it known they're doing this.
[00:24:56.077 --> 00:24:59.059]  This is a scandal beyond the Hunter Biden laptop.
[00:24:59.299 --> 00:25:02.521]  It's a scandal beyond Internet censorship and big tech control.
[00:25:03.362 --> 00:25:03.942]  Do you hear me?
[00:25:04.603 --> 00:25:05.643]  This is a Rosetta Stone.
[00:25:05.683 --> 00:25:07.284]  This is a keyhole in their operation.
[00:25:07.585 --> 00:25:10.767]  This is Biden issuing fake terror alerts...
[00:25:13.735 --> 00:25:15.676]  That they did a year ago as well, we now learn.
[00:25:16.237 --> 00:25:18.998]  Telling the Border Patrol right-wingers are coming to kill you.
[00:25:19.278 --> 00:25:22.960]  And the feds are just like, the rank and file are just like, oh my God.
[00:25:24.141 --> 00:25:26.922]  We've already seen this rodeo before with the Haitians.
[00:25:27.523 --> 00:25:28.924]  And this is a load of crap.
[00:25:29.384 --> 00:25:36.347]  And then the NSA that the Border Patrol is heavily interfaced with says, we're refusing right now to turn this on.
[00:25:36.728 --> 00:25:38.529]  We're not, plus imagine the work.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:43.242]  Now they don't just want the cameras scanning all the faces coming across the border.
[00:25:43.482 --> 00:25:50.846]  Now all these cameras everywhere are grabbing everybody's face and putting them in databases.
[00:25:51.006 --> 00:25:54.828]  It's the government waging war against the American people.
[00:25:54.848 --> 00:26:03.032]  All right, we're going to go to break, come back with Tim Enlub, head of InfoWars security and all of his breaking news.
[00:26:03.072 --> 00:26:06.474]  He's getting even more information, I'm told, since I talked to him about an hour and a half ago.
[00:26:08.004 --> 00:26:09.329]  I'm going to talk about this right now.
[00:26:10.414 --> 00:26:12.140]  Infowars, this isn't hype.
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:12.803]  This is real.
[00:26:12.843 --> 00:26:13.325]  We've done it.
[00:26:14.696 --> 00:26:15.096]  We're good to go.
[00:26:38.993 --> 00:26:42.357]  So none of the credit goes to me, but we are doing very important work.
[00:26:42.697 --> 00:26:45.099]  So I need all of you listening to make a decision.
[00:26:45.139 --> 00:26:45.780]  It's up to you.
[00:26:47.282 --> 00:26:48.643]  Just say, I'm going to go to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:26:48.663 --> 00:26:49.484]  I'm going to get a t-shirt.
[00:26:49.524 --> 00:26:50.145]  I'm going to get a book.
[00:26:50.185 --> 00:26:50.745]  I'm going to get a film.
[00:26:50.765 --> 00:26:53.548]  I'm going to sign up for auto ship on Great Subway so you get 10% off.
[00:26:54.349 --> 00:26:55.290]  On top of all the other specials.
[00:26:56.251 --> 00:26:59.975]  I'm going to go there and I'm going to back Americans in this important time.
[00:27:00.035 --> 00:27:01.797]  And if just more people would do it.
[00:27:03.504 --> 00:27:10.988]  If more people would share the articles and the videos, what you're doing, I'm saying a lot of you aren't, we would change the world at an even greater clip.
[00:27:11.369 --> 00:27:14.410]  So, nitric boost was our sleeper product.
[00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:15.031]  We put it out.
[00:27:15.051 --> 00:27:16.232]  It cleans out your blood.
[00:27:16.932 --> 00:27:21.575]  Vasodilation, all these great known compounds that are natural, so good for you.
[00:27:22.095 --> 00:27:25.037]  You want to counter the strokes, the heart attacks, all the spike proteins.
[00:27:25.977 --> 00:27:26.898]  You need nitric boost.
[00:27:28.032 --> 00:27:32.235]  Well, we went to an even bigger manufacturer to get even higher quality ingredients.
[00:27:32.295 --> 00:27:33.375]  The other one was great.
[00:27:33.636 --> 00:27:36.898]  This is reformulated, the exact same formula, but different supplier.
[00:27:38.032 --> 00:27:38.852]  And we even got a better deal.
[00:27:39.453 --> 00:27:44.095]  So instead of offering 25% off on Nitric Boost, we never went past that because the product was so expensive.
[00:27:44.295 --> 00:27:44.915]  We got a better deal.
[00:27:44.935 --> 00:27:50.357]  40% off on Nitric Boost.
[00:27:50.377 --> 00:27:52.738]  40% off right now on Nitric Boost.
[00:27:53.279 --> 00:27:56.520]  Everybody should be on this, but particularly middle-aged people and older folks.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.300]  It is incredible.
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.021]  Clean out your blood.
[00:27:58.401 --> 00:27:59.121]  Counter the globalists.
[00:28:00.122 --> 00:28:02.723]  Get Nitric Boost right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:28:02.763 --> 00:28:05.044]  And this is selling out, but we've got another order in.
[00:28:05.304 --> 00:28:07.145]  Dr. Jones Naturals, InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:28:08.888 --> 00:28:10.331]  Next level foundational energy.
[00:28:10.872 --> 00:28:12.034]  Methylfolate.
[00:28:12.615 --> 00:28:14.659]  The breakdown the cells make of...
[00:28:16.004 --> 00:28:17.946]  What is in the spinach that Popeye eats?
[00:28:18.386 --> 00:28:20.328]  I'm strong to the finish because I eat my spinach.
[00:28:20.348 --> 00:28:21.809]  I'm Popeye the Sailor.
[00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:23.271]  That's folic acid.
[00:28:23.311 --> 00:28:27.054]  But most people, particularly white people, don't absorb a lot of folic acid.
[00:28:27.334 --> 00:28:28.255]  This is the breakdown of it.
[00:28:28.275 --> 00:28:31.558]  You absorb it all with a key complex of vitamins that supercharge it.
[00:28:31.858 --> 00:28:36.442]  Get Next Level Foundational Energy at InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139 and get a...
[00:28:41.787 --> 00:28:43.089]  See a Humanity t-shirt.
[00:28:43.149 --> 00:28:45.071]  Get a 1776 Gadsden shirt.
[00:28:45.452 --> 00:28:46.333]  Just support us.
[00:28:46.793 --> 00:28:47.955]  We're asking for your help.
[00:28:47.975 --> 00:28:48.976]  We're fighting together.
[00:28:49.376 --> 00:28:50.638]  Please take action now.
[00:28:51.179 --> 00:28:52.881]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:28:52.961 --> 00:28:53.862]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:59.775 --> 00:29:03.298]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[00:29:03.678 --> 00:29:10.703]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[00:29:10.883 --> 00:29:12.884]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[00:29:13.065 --> 00:29:14.125]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[00:29:14.185 --> 00:29:14.846]  He loved the idea.
[00:29:15.186 --> 00:29:18.710]  What would you call the debate and discussion about a pro-human future?
[00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:19.591]  Just Team Humanity?
[00:29:19.671 --> 00:29:20.552]  Yes, Team Humanity.
[00:29:20.712 --> 00:29:21.152]  Absolutely.
[00:29:21.473 --> 00:29:22.854]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[00:29:22.934 --> 00:29:26.378]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[00:29:26.598 --> 00:29:34.046]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to give InfoWars on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[00:29:34.306 --> 00:29:46.035]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a revolution against the globalists and it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.

[00:33:27.605 --> 00:33:36.350]  Global exclusive, Biden administration using secret fake terror alerts to target conservative Americans with NSA technology illegally, warns whistleblowers.
[00:33:37.612 --> 00:33:42.235]  And Tim Inlow, head of enforced security down there with the crew, has all these sources.
[00:33:42.255 --> 00:33:42.996]  He's done a great job.
[00:33:43.036 --> 00:33:43.956]  He's seen the documents.
[00:33:44.777 --> 00:33:45.477]  This is going on.
[00:33:45.497 --> 00:33:50.060]  But this is how Biden wants to roll out January 6th against the American people.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.801]  They're planning something big down there.
[00:33:52.081 --> 00:34:06.431]  The answer is more people, more cameras, spotlighting what's going on, issuing terror alerts to then turn NSA facial recognition on against the American people, taking what they did on January 6th at the Capitol and expanding it.
[00:34:07.182 --> 00:34:07.703]  We're good to go.
[00:34:23.703 --> 00:34:24.523]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:34:24.724 --> 00:34:25.684]  Tell us what's happening.
[00:34:54.003 --> 00:34:54.824]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:34:54.865 --> 00:34:55.645]  Good to be on.
[00:34:56.066 --> 00:35:03.415]  So we've been here in Eagle Pass, Texas since Tuesday, covering the situation down here and what's going on on the border.
[00:35:04.416 --> 00:35:05.357]  It's really incredible.
[00:35:05.438 --> 00:35:12.046]  And during that time, we've developed some incredible sources that work for the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:35:12.887 --> 00:35:18.973]  And one source in particular has been spot on about all the information that they've given us.
[00:35:19.033 --> 00:35:22.336]  We'll call him Elias is the source.
[00:35:22.376 --> 00:35:25.079]  That's the name we'll use for the source is Elias.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:29.303]  And so it kind of all started really rolling fast yesterday.
[00:35:29.403 --> 00:35:31.205]  So around 3.48 p.m.
[00:35:31.225 --> 00:35:33.347]  yesterday afternoon on February 1st,
[00:35:34.939 --> 00:35:51.615]  I got a call from my source, Elias, basically saying, hey, don't know what's going on, but suddenly they're evacuating the main Border Patrol processing, migrant processing center that's located on Firefly Lane here in Eagle Path.
[00:35:52.487 --> 00:35:52.747]  Yes, we are.
[00:36:26.783 --> 00:36:28.964]  Alright, we had a little Skype problem there from the border.
[00:36:28.984 --> 00:36:30.165]  We're going to reconnect with Tim.
[00:36:30.385 --> 00:36:30.966]  Tim, hold on.
[00:36:32.046 --> 00:36:32.947]  Just tell him back up.
[00:36:33.087 --> 00:36:36.989]  You immediately proceeded to the Border Patrol Station, Eagle Pass.
[00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:38.310]  That's when you cut out.
[00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:39.351]  Let's see if we got Tim back.
[00:36:43.713 --> 00:36:46.415]  Tim, you immediately proceeded to the Eagle Pass Border Patrol Station.
[00:36:46.755 --> 00:36:47.456]  That's when you cut out.
[00:36:47.476 --> 00:36:47.796]  Go ahead.
[00:36:48.877 --> 00:36:49.297]  That's correct.
[00:36:50.095 --> 00:36:50.495]  Yes, sir.
[00:36:50.776 --> 00:36:54.939]  We proceeded to the South Eagle Border Patrol Station.
[00:36:55.299 --> 00:37:00.823]  We saw five large buses coming in, which basically confirmed our sources' information.
[00:37:01.563 --> 00:37:07.248]  Those buses were filled to the brim with migrants, and they took them into that South Station.
[00:37:08.388 --> 00:37:10.950]  Then around 5.30 p.m.
[00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:14.353]  yesterday evening, I met in person...
[00:37:14.993 --> 00:37:42.106]  With this source, with Elias, who showed me the FBI memo that had been sent to all the Border Patrol stations, basically saying that the FBI had identified two white supremacists who were planning an attack on the Border Patrol Processing Center on Firefly Lane sometime between today, Friday, February 2nd, and Monday, February 5th.
[00:37:42.967 --> 00:37:50.233]  And out of an abundance of caution, the Border Patrol decided to immediately move those migrants to more secure facilities.
[00:37:50.594 --> 00:37:52.055]  That was at 5.30pm yesterday evening.
[00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:57.961]  At 7.40 a.m.
[00:37:58.001 --> 00:38:16.472]  this morning, I get a call from an additional source who then informed me that there are heated, and this was a quote, heated discussions going on at Fort Bede, Virginia, obviously where the NSA is located, about using facial recognition against
[00:38:17.012 --> 00:38:18.192]  We're good to go.
[00:38:18.212 --> 00:38:18.833]  I think?
[00:38:49.352 --> 00:38:51.954]  I mean, this is just sensational information.
[00:38:52.074 --> 00:38:54.596]  And then we learned a year ago they did it with the Haitians as well.
[00:38:54.636 --> 00:38:56.957]  So obviously, I know you talked to your sources.
[00:38:57.017 --> 00:38:57.578]  They concurred.
[00:38:57.858 --> 00:39:06.424]  This is an attempt to roll out the entire international defense system against the American people, which Biden has said the main enemy is the American people.
[00:39:06.524 --> 00:39:10.807]  It's great to see this pushback from federal intelligence and law enforcement.
[00:39:12.159 --> 00:39:12.359]  Right.
[00:39:12.879 --> 00:39:14.060]  And that's one thing I can tell you.
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:28.904]  Since we've been here on Tuesday, the agents on the ground here, whether it's Border Patrol, the National Guard units that are here, all of them are 100%, the ones we've talked to, are 100% on the side of the American people, right?
[00:39:29.584 --> 00:39:31.185]  They don't like what's going on.
[00:39:31.825 --> 00:39:32.946]  They want to make a difference.
[00:39:32.986 --> 00:39:34.648]  They want to stop this invasion.
[00:39:34.968 --> 00:39:41.693]  But they are somewhat hamstrung, obviously, by their leadership and by the orders that are coming out of Washington.
[00:39:41.713 --> 00:39:44.976]  Yeah, they're not in charge of the money or the policy, so they're stuck in a rock and a hard place.
[00:39:46.142 --> 00:39:47.102]  That's exactly right.
[00:39:47.342 --> 00:39:59.864]  But the ones that are actually boots on ground here have been nothing but cooperative with us, have been willing to share a lot of inside information with us because they want the word to get out on what's going on down here on this southern border, right?
[00:40:00.184 --> 00:40:05.605]  With the terrorists coming across, child rapists coming across, murderers coming across.
[00:40:05.765 --> 00:40:14.667]  And for people to watch the show, you can literally pull the government...
[00:40:15.831 --> 00:40:16.471]  Hold on, Tim.
[00:40:16.692 --> 00:40:17.372]  Tim, stay there.
[00:40:18.053 --> 00:40:18.773]  Tim, hold on a minute.
[00:40:19.414 --> 00:40:20.434]  Yeah, start over.
[00:40:20.735 --> 00:40:22.856]  You were getting into the rapists coming across the border.
[00:40:23.337 --> 00:40:25.518]  Your Skype broke up again, but it's going to reconnect.
[00:40:25.638 --> 00:40:26.319]  Okay, it's back.
[00:40:26.359 --> 00:40:26.699]  Go ahead.
[00:40:28.881 --> 00:40:30.622]  Yeah, my apologies to Wi-Fi out here.
[00:40:30.662 --> 00:40:31.463]  That's not your fault.
[00:40:31.483 --> 00:40:31.863]  We get it.
[00:40:31.883 --> 00:40:32.944]  Hey, it's great technology.
[00:40:32.964 --> 00:40:33.624]  We're lucky to have you.
[00:40:33.644 --> 00:40:33.884]  Go ahead.
[00:40:33.905 --> 00:40:34.225]  Keep going.
[00:40:34.884 --> 00:40:35.104]  Right.
[00:40:36.024 --> 00:40:47.187]  So, again, you know, viewers can pull up these documents, right, that show just how many child rapists have been contacted by Border Patrol, how many murderers have been stopped by Border Patrol.
[00:40:47.747 --> 00:40:54.409]  I mean, but the problem is those are the ones that either surrendered or were caught by Border Patrol, right?
[00:40:54.629 --> 00:40:59.410]  So when we look at those numbers, which are in the thousands, thousands, right,
[00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:10.154]  Then you've got to think about the gotaways, what the Border Patrol calls gotaways, which are the ones who didn't want to be caught and who definitely wanted to get into the country without contact by law enforcement.
[00:41:10.474 --> 00:41:14.395]  And those number in the hundreds and hundreds of thousands.
[00:41:14.696 --> 00:41:26.660]  And if we just look at the percentages of criminals that the Border Patrol has caught, then you have to assume the percentages apply to gotaways as well, if not more, because those...
[00:41:28.032 --> 00:41:36.977]  All right, Tim, stay there again.
[00:41:37.017 --> 00:41:39.398]  You're having some... There's a lot of people down there now.
[00:41:39.418 --> 00:41:42.000]  There's not a lot of cell phone reception here on the border.
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:44.401]  We probably maybe can do this at the hotel next time.
[00:41:45.982 --> 00:41:55.428]  Look, you've been there with me with the high-level federal judges and the federal agents who are really concerned about this and how they're told that we are ordered...
[00:41:56.488 --> 00:42:04.494]  Under law to release known criminals, all we can do is keep them for a few weeks under statutes of misdemeanors for being an illegal crosser.
[00:42:05.014 --> 00:42:08.696]  So I'm not trying to lionize the feds, but we're in meetings with high-level feds.
[00:42:08.716 --> 00:42:10.157]  We're not just saying that here on air.
[00:42:11.058 --> 00:42:12.019]  So this is crazy.
[00:42:12.339 --> 00:42:19.324]  The top is doing all this crime with Mayorkas, but whether it's high-level federal judges or FBI agents or federal marshals,
[00:42:20.404 --> 00:42:21.246]  We're Border Patrol.
[00:42:21.767 --> 00:42:24.111]  They are all super upset and don't know what to do.
[00:42:24.232 --> 00:42:25.053]  We don't know what to do.
[00:42:25.073 --> 00:42:30.685]  I mean, can you speak to those without getting into details, the meetings we've had, so people know the level of concern we're dealing with?
[00:42:37.967 --> 00:42:38.967]  Let's do this.
[00:42:38.987 --> 00:42:39.828]  Let's reconnect with Tim.
[00:42:40.568 --> 00:42:40.948]  Reconnect.
[00:42:41.368 --> 00:42:43.429]  Because his feet is cutting out.
[00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:46.171]  And again, they only got so many cell towers down there.
[00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:48.372]  And now the caravan's getting there.
[00:42:48.752 --> 00:42:49.833]  The convoy's getting there.
[00:42:49.893 --> 00:42:50.733]  There's people everywhere.
[00:42:51.273 --> 00:42:53.775]  And so I wanted them to be on the border for this.
[00:42:54.315 --> 00:42:58.920]  I almost said do it at the hotel, but I wanted them to be at the border so people could see this.
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.161]  That's my decision to do that.
[00:43:00.602 --> 00:43:02.364]  My earlier decision was just stay at the hotel.
[00:43:02.384 --> 00:43:03.245]  We've got better internet.
[00:43:03.705 --> 00:43:05.808]  People need to know we're at the damn Texas border.
[00:43:06.708 --> 00:43:07.670]  This is all going down.
[00:43:08.871 --> 00:43:09.992]  This is all happening, folks.
[00:43:10.152 --> 00:43:11.273]  This is just totally insane.
[00:43:12.364 --> 00:43:17.048]  And, I mean, I'm in meetings with, like, I don't want to say who, because it gives it away.
[00:43:17.088 --> 00:43:17.629]  It's already known.
[00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:22.273]  The head judges, the head FBI people, they're like, what do we do?
[00:43:22.873 --> 00:43:24.695]  I don't, I mean, I'm like them, like, what do we do?
[00:43:25.155 --> 00:43:28.838]  I mean, this is mass criminal activity taking place.
[00:43:30.179 --> 00:43:33.102]  This is human trafficking, kidnapped children.
[00:43:34.192 --> 00:43:40.373]  This is so unbelievable that you're like, we're all asking each other, what do we do?
[00:43:40.813 --> 00:43:42.473]  Because we're not administrative control.
[00:43:42.534 --> 00:43:48.275]  We don't try to pay our bills and put gas in the car and keep the lights on.
[00:43:48.295 --> 00:44:01.357]  And we're sitting here watching this mass criminal activity and illegal aliens beating up police in New York City and a day later released out of jail telling the media, F you, and laughing.
[00:44:02.037 --> 00:44:04.580]  I mean, George Soros runs this country.
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:06.062]  I don't say that to empower him.
[00:44:06.582 --> 00:44:09.425]  Let's admit where we are.
[00:44:10.306 --> 00:44:13.290]  Let's admit how much we're getting our ass kicked.
[00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:18.896]  Because in my life, I didn't start the fights, I finished them, and I won almost all of them.
[00:44:18.916 --> 00:44:19.456]  I lost a few.
[00:44:20.353 --> 00:44:25.717]  But when I finally realized I'm getting my ass handed to me, I'm going to open a can of a whoop-ass.
[00:44:25.757 --> 00:44:26.417]  That's when I'd win.
[00:44:27.278 --> 00:44:28.639]  And that's where we are politically.
[00:44:29.079 --> 00:44:33.142]  If they can't reconnect via Skype or Zoom, do it over the phone, okay?
[00:44:33.762 --> 00:44:34.023]  Boom.
[00:44:34.103 --> 00:44:34.623]  Call Stone.
[00:44:34.643 --> 00:44:35.243]  Get him on right now.
[00:44:36.805 --> 00:44:39.587]  So that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:40.387 --> 00:44:41.847]  We'll get Chase Geiser on as well.
[00:44:42.628 --> 00:44:48.670]  But this is such a massive, massive, massive development.
[00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:50.090]  We basically already got it out.
[00:44:50.770 --> 00:44:52.851]  But you just heard that.
[00:44:52.871 --> 00:44:55.492]  We're not up here like, oh, we met with federal judges.
[00:44:55.652 --> 00:44:56.852]  Oh, we met with the FBI.
[00:44:57.072 --> 00:44:58.993]  Oh, we met with the state police.
[00:44:59.033 --> 00:45:01.174]  We met with the Border Patrol.
[00:45:01.734 --> 00:45:03.514]  We have seen the documents.
[00:45:05.335 --> 00:45:08.116]  We have released the information.
[00:45:09.446 --> 00:45:26.399]  So they're planning something big down there, but the good news is we've got so many cameras and so many people and the Border Patrol and the state police and the National Guard and the State Guard and everybody is so dialed in, they're like, we're worried about a false flag right now.
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:30.282]  Oh yeah, white supremacists are going to attack the Border Patrol.
[00:45:31.062 --> 00:45:33.044]  White supremacists are about to kill the illegal aliens.
[00:45:33.925 --> 00:45:34.546]  We're good to go.
[00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.789]  Doing this.
[00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:56.611]  I'm going to find out what's going on.
[00:45:56.631 --> 00:45:59.273]  I'm going to play a clip and come right back here.
[00:45:59.293 --> 00:46:03.697]  We got some new, really powerful special reports that have got to be seen.
[00:46:04.678 --> 00:46:05.458]  So I want to play...
[00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:07.411]  Democide.
[00:46:07.751 --> 00:46:14.235]  Democrat congressmen and state reps and others, just like Swallowswell and Biden, are calling for the U.S.
[00:46:14.275 --> 00:46:18.098]  military to bomb anybody that goes to the border and expose what's happening.
[00:46:18.438 --> 00:46:26.064]  That's how disconnected and unaware of military affairs, if the feds bomb the border and us, that wouldn't be good for us.
[00:46:26.104 --> 00:46:26.884]  It's like the Alamo.
[00:46:26.944 --> 00:46:28.065]  That's bad for them.
[00:46:28.505 --> 00:46:29.446]  But they don't even know.
[00:46:29.486 --> 00:46:31.227]  They say nuke Republican cities.
[00:46:31.587 --> 00:46:33.029]  Democrats control all the cities.
[00:46:33.269 --> 00:46:33.549]  All of them.
[00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:35.991]  But that's where they are.
[00:46:36.011 --> 00:46:36.511]  Here's the report.
[00:46:56.599 --> 00:46:59.501]  This is a document that was found in Jacumba, California.
[00:46:59.521 --> 00:47:01.143]  It's written in Chinese.
[00:47:01.363 --> 00:47:03.685]  If you go on the back, though, this is what really gets me.
[00:47:03.705 --> 00:47:10.770]  It actually has the organization that created this document, directly from Ultralado and the American Bar Association.
[00:47:11.031 --> 00:47:12.812]  These guys are directly aiding and abetting.
[00:47:12.892 --> 00:47:24.660]  Tensions are high as a wide-open border floods Texas cities with military-aged males, criminals, and potential terrorists that has citizens on edge.
[00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:32.306]  Courtney Hacking keeps a shrine in her Nevada home to her husband Peter, her four-year-old daughter Ellie, and her two-year-old son Grayson.
[00:47:32.706 --> 00:47:35.268]  Their car was struck head-on, killing all three.
[00:47:35.288 --> 00:47:40.792]  He was here illegally, he drove illegally, he was working illegally, and he killed three innocent people.
[00:47:41.312 --> 00:47:49.396]  Francisco Oropesa, 38-year-old Mexican national who has allegedly killed five of his former Texas neighbors.
[00:47:49.436 --> 00:47:54.539]  He apparently was out shooting a weapon, being very loud and belligerent, apparently drinking.
[00:47:54.599 --> 00:47:58.460]  The neighbors went outside and asked him to stop shooting that weapon.
[00:47:58.741 --> 00:48:04.243]  He then, in turn, took his AR-15 and allegedly slaughtered a family of five, including a nine-year-old boy.
[00:48:04.303 --> 00:48:04.903]  My newly...
[00:48:06.224 --> 00:48:12.349]  20-year-old daughter Kayla Hamilton was murdered in her own room and left on the floor like trash.
[00:48:12.549 --> 00:48:18.013]  Kayla's murderer was apprehended by border patrol crossing illegally into the U.S.
[00:48:18.113 --> 00:48:21.055]  at the southwest border in Rio Grande City, Texas.
[00:48:21.155 --> 00:48:26.179]  He was a 16-year-old known gang member affiliated with MS-13 in El Salvador.
[00:48:26.719 --> 00:48:35.444]  As the Biden administration demands, the United Nations NGO Soros Engineered Invasion continue at all costs.
[00:48:35.464 --> 00:48:45.109]  500 million investment, he says, to invest in startups, establish companies, social impact initiatives, and businesses started by migrants and refugees.
[00:48:45.129 --> 00:48:49.432]  What about all the people in this country that could really use that help themselves to get a leg up?
[00:48:49.492 --> 00:48:50.993]  You know, charity begins at home.
[00:49:00.246 --> 00:49:02.487]  He immediately halted construction of the border wall.
[00:49:03.107 --> 00:49:06.528]  He reinstated the disastrous policy of catch and release.
[00:49:07.269 --> 00:49:10.971]  And he ended the incredibly successful Remain in Mexico agreement.
[00:49:10.991 --> 00:49:13.732]  And that took the lowest rate of illegal immigration.
[00:49:14.432 --> 00:49:16.233]  And it caused it to explode.
[00:49:16.573 --> 00:49:19.234]  We now have the highest rate in history.
[00:49:20.775 --> 00:49:23.156]  9.6 million illegal immigrants have come into this country.
[00:49:23.476 --> 00:49:24.936]  And Joe Biden wants it.
[00:49:25.336 --> 00:49:26.137]  It's deliberate.
[00:49:26.177 --> 00:49:27.537]  He could fix it tomorrow.
[00:49:27.857 --> 00:49:29.558]  Okay, we've had a problem here.
[00:49:29.738 --> 00:49:41.583]  Responding to a tweet spotlighting the heavily armed states backing Texas in its standoff with the Biden administration, rather than at the very least calm the fears of his constituents...
[00:49:41.883 --> 00:49:51.151]  Texas Democrat State Representative Gene Wu suggested the proper response to those backing Texas would be for the U.S.
[00:49:51.271 --> 00:49:57.757]  military to drop bombs on these Americans with drone-fired Hellfire missiles.
[00:49:58.177 --> 00:49:58.437]  Never, ever.
[00:50:17.808 --> 00:50:26.452]  In my three-plus decades, ever heard anyone accuse parents of murdered children of being partisan one way or the other.
[00:50:26.712 --> 00:50:36.917]  State Representative Gene Wu has been accusing Crimestoppers of being partisan for calling out judges who grant multiple felony bonds to repeat violent offenders.
[00:50:37.397 --> 00:50:40.999]  In a tweet, Kahn invited Wu to a POMC meeting.
[00:50:41.059 --> 00:50:44.981]  Mr. Wu declined, said, I don't go to Republican organization events.
[00:50:45.801 --> 00:50:52.126]  And when I woke up on Saturday and I saw that, that hurt me because this is not a partisan group.
[00:50:52.326 --> 00:51:02.593]  For the life of me, I cannot figure out why a state representative would come to the ill-advised conclusion that POMC meetings at Crimestoppers are partisan.
[00:51:02.913 --> 00:51:05.055]  That's about as far-fetched as you can get.
[00:51:05.175 --> 00:51:11.219]  The madness to destroy the United States from within is completely off the rails in 2024.
[00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:22.482]  As disturbing video from Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport shows a group of migrants tucked away in a hidden room guarded by a U.S.
[00:51:23.082 --> 00:51:23.863]  service member.
[00:51:24.063 --> 00:51:31.484]  Yeah, so these are just recently documented travelers getting away from ICE, getting to where they need to be.
[00:51:31.644 --> 00:51:33.285]  Apparently, the U.S.
[00:51:33.545 --> 00:51:38.466]  military is aiding and abetting the collapse of the United States.
[00:51:38.866 --> 00:51:43.591]  I love my right-wing friends who talk about the tree of liberty is water of the blood of patriots.
[00:51:43.831 --> 00:51:47.335]  If you need to work about taking on the federal government, you need some F-15s.
[00:51:47.935 --> 00:51:51.739]  America is in free fall, and no one is manning the controls.
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:56.504]  The point of no return may already be long behind us.
[00:51:56.845 --> 00:51:58.106]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:52:03.672 --> 00:52:07.694]  All right, our crew had their internet cut.
[00:52:07.714 --> 00:52:11.495]  They're going to move to another location and join us coming up at the start of the next hour.
[00:52:12.756 --> 00:52:22.359]  The former Defense Intelligence Agency Green Beret and lawyer Ivan Ranklin is going to join us in studio to talk about all the things that are happening in the world and more.
[00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:26.041]  We're going to get a pop-in on the economy at the bottom of the next hour by Kirk Elliott.
[00:52:26.821 --> 00:52:28.622]  And we're also going to have Jay Dyer.
[00:52:30.718 --> 00:52:34.021]  Joining us coming up in the fourth hour today.
[00:52:34.481 --> 00:52:40.466]  But again, everybody in media, almost everybody, follows somebody else's story.
[00:52:41.787 --> 00:52:56.719]  We are breaking that they are saying that white supremacists are going to attack the Border Patrol and the illegal aliens down there that they call migrants with no evidence as a pretext to have the NSA turn on its systems against the American people.
[00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:57.960]  This is a big deal.
[00:52:58.901 --> 00:52:59.822]  And I don't even care about
[00:53:00.794 --> 00:53:02.175]  We're good to go.
[00:53:30.418 --> 00:53:31.619]  You're like, well, we better not go down there.
[00:53:31.679 --> 00:53:33.740]  No, no, you go down there to expose it.
[00:53:34.181 --> 00:53:35.682]  Imagine we said, we're not going down there.
[00:53:35.702 --> 00:53:36.282]  We'll get set up.
[00:53:36.602 --> 00:53:39.524]  It's not one capital, one event where they can set us up.
[00:53:39.544 --> 00:53:40.245]  It's a huge border.
[00:53:40.905 --> 00:53:46.329]  They fear us there exposing the entire operation.
[00:53:47.810 --> 00:53:53.274]  So this is a big, big, big, big, big, big deal.
[00:53:54.575 --> 00:53:57.197]  And we cannot do this without you.
[00:53:58.021 --> 00:53:58.641]  And that's why.
[00:53:59.161 --> 00:54:02.243]  You go down there and you'll see them smuggling drugs right across in front of you.
[00:54:02.823 --> 00:54:06.364]  You'll see all sorts of just insane stuff all around you.
[00:54:06.384 --> 00:54:09.785]  It's like shooting fish in a barrel.
[00:54:11.586 --> 00:54:13.287]  It is ridiculous.
[00:54:14.047 --> 00:54:25.251]  But what did Thomas Jefferson, he got asked famously, walking out of the legislature during the war, a woman asked him, what is the limit that tyrants will go to?
[00:54:25.271 --> 00:54:27.152]  And he said, the limit good men and women allow.
[00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:30.923]  All right.
[00:54:30.943 --> 00:54:32.086]  They got moved to another location.
[00:54:32.106 --> 00:54:34.091]  We're going to break here in just a few minutes.
[00:54:34.131 --> 00:54:35.194]  But Tim...
[00:54:36.482 --> 00:54:45.566]  This is very encouraging that we've got such great intel from the Border Patrol and the NSA and the feds.
[00:54:46.046 --> 00:54:49.227]  I was asking about the feds we've met with, the judges, the names.
[00:54:49.627 --> 00:54:58.110]  I'm not trying to lionize the feds, but having top-level federal judges meet with us and people, this shows they're really upset.
[00:54:58.350 --> 00:55:00.611]  The whole government's not the problem, it's who's running at the top.
[00:55:01.111 --> 00:55:01.672]  That's my view.
[00:55:01.692 --> 00:55:02.112]  What's your view?
[00:55:03.571 --> 00:55:04.152]  I agree with that 100%.
[00:55:04.192 --> 00:55:11.119]  The worm is turning, even within the federal government, which is really encouraging for us to see.
[00:55:11.139 --> 00:55:16.785]  I mean, we've had, like you said, we had a well-known federal judge meet with us, U.S.
[00:55:16.845 --> 00:55:20.389]  Marshals meet with us, Department of Homeland Security.
[00:55:20.409 --> 00:55:25.795]  A lot of people are upset because I think for the first time,
[00:55:26.916 --> 00:55:47.096]  Even the ones who wanted to be kind of concerned about their careers and kind of go along to get along, that kind of mentality, I think this 10 million influx, and again, of which we previously discussed, a high percentage are going to be criminals, are going to be terrorists, are going to be just bad actors for this country.
[00:55:47.456 --> 00:55:50.199]  I think for the first time it has even shook
[00:55:50.771 --> 00:55:51.591]  We're good to go.
[00:56:11.325 --> 00:56:13.386]  They still want to hold on to that ideology.
[00:56:13.686 --> 00:56:22.248]  But I think just one or two levels down, I think this invasion has shook Americans across the board to their core.
[00:56:28.976 --> 00:56:30.197]  That's how evil always works.
[00:56:30.237 --> 00:56:34.699]  It looks like it's winning until it gets so ridiculous, good people finally wake up.
[00:56:35.719 --> 00:56:37.000]  You've been there many times with me.
[00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:38.441]  You've been there many times I'm not there.
[00:56:38.461 --> 00:56:42.343]  It's not like you're looking for kids being smuggled.
[00:56:42.383 --> 00:56:43.763]  It's just everywhere.
[00:56:44.244 --> 00:56:46.685]  When you go there, it's like Disney World for pedophiles.
[00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.889]  That's exactly right.
[00:56:49.209 --> 00:56:49.449]  Yes.
[00:56:50.089 --> 00:56:51.150]  And that's one of the things.
[00:56:51.210 --> 00:56:57.551]  Some of the agents have described to us the difficulty that they have had dealing with that.
[00:56:57.831 --> 00:57:01.832]  And that's one of the interesting points that was brought up to us just two days ago.
[00:57:01.852 --> 00:57:07.633]  And that was this, that for the first time now, they are seeing recycled kids, Alex.
[00:57:07.913 --> 00:57:11.654]  They are seeing kids that are coming completely bombed out on drugs.
[00:57:12.034 --> 00:57:13.195]  They're putting them on buses.
[00:57:13.255 --> 00:57:15.277]  They're sending them to the processing stations.
[00:57:15.597 --> 00:57:19.140]  The processing stations are sending them to other areas in the U.S.
[00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:27.226]  And within two weeks, within two weeks, Alex, the same kids are coming back across the Mexican border into Texas.
[00:57:27.566 --> 00:57:31.870]  And these same Border Patrol agents are processing these same kids.
[00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:38.635]  And they're saying this is the first time that they have seen these kids be recycled in the numbers that they currently are.
[00:57:38.755 --> 00:57:40.055]  This is so huge.
[00:57:40.356 --> 00:57:41.276]  Obama first did it.
[00:57:41.296 --> 00:57:42.536]  He said, you got a kid, you get a cross.
[00:57:42.856 --> 00:57:44.457]  They're literally a ticket they're using.
[00:57:44.737 --> 00:57:47.018]  Let's come back in two minutes and talk more about that.
[00:57:47.298 --> 00:57:48.098]  This is so important.
[00:57:50.139 --> 00:57:53.920]  It doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman, old or young.
[00:57:54.560 --> 00:58:01.383]  Nitric Boost does incredible things for your entire cardiovascular system, your immune system, your blood, everything.

[00:58:54.064 --> 00:58:55.585]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:58:56.365 --> 00:58:59.407]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:59:00.308 --> 00:59:08.393]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:59:09.233 --> 00:59:17.018]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:59:18.047 --> 00:59:20.890]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:59:20.910 --> 00:59:26.675]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.

[00:59:28.416 --> 00:59:29.898]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[00:59:29.938 --> 00:59:30.478]  Keep doing it.
[00:59:30.518 --> 00:59:37.124]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[00:59:37.565 --> 00:59:38.746]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[00:59:39.366 --> 00:59:43.090]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:43.730 --> 00:59:48.355]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsTore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:59:48.695 --> 00:59:49.536]  Please take action now.
[00:59:51.077 --> 00:59:56.983]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:22.863]  Well, we're living in epic times, so finish up the point you were making about how the lower 90% of the feds are totally upset.
[01:00:23.183 --> 01:00:24.183]  They see what's happening.
[01:00:24.223 --> 01:00:26.923]  They know they're part of a crime and they don't do something.
[01:00:26.943 --> 01:00:29.024]  And then they see the media covering it up.
[01:00:29.044 --> 01:00:29.644]  They see all this.
[01:00:29.744 --> 01:00:31.344]  It's creating a crisis of conscience.
[01:00:31.825 --> 01:00:33.625]  And then shifting gears to the next segment, Tim.
[01:00:35.285 --> 01:00:42.731]  They're saying imminent white supremacist attack with no evidence against these border facilities, obviously to trigger the NSA system against the American people.
[01:00:42.771 --> 01:00:43.351]  That's come out.
[01:00:43.371 --> 01:00:52.238]  I want to elaborate on that, but just get back to what you were saying before the break about the crisis of conscience with the feds being given these illegal orders.
[01:00:53.719 --> 01:00:53.939]  Right.
[01:00:54.239 --> 01:01:03.727]  And to give you an idea of just how serious it is, the source that I spoke with told me that some of the National Guard members have actually...
[01:01:04.865 --> 01:01:13.252]  ...asked to be taken off this assignment, and I'm talking about specifically the ones who were dealing with the children in the detention centers.
[01:01:13.532 --> 01:01:23.821]  They literally asked to be taken off this assignment because it was traumatizing them, seeing these kids coming through their facilities, drugged up, watching them go through withdrawals,
[01:01:24.361 --> 01:01:32.424]  Putting them on buses only to see them come back two weeks later, back across the border again, drugged up again, going through withdrawals again.
[01:01:32.784 --> 01:01:34.505]  This is something that they said.
[01:01:34.525 --> 01:01:40.147]  And by the way, we're going to pull those videos up since you mentioned it, but there's hundreds of videos of just kids bombed out of their brains.
[01:01:40.687 --> 01:01:41.607]  You and I went down there.
[01:01:41.627 --> 01:01:42.467]  We're not being pussies.
[01:01:42.487 --> 01:01:43.528]  You've been in a bunch of wars.
[01:01:43.988 --> 01:01:48.309]  You've said to me, I've said, I don't want to go down there because it's so depressing a few days.
[01:01:48.449 --> 01:01:49.970]  Imagine being the Border Patrol.
[01:01:51.187 --> 01:01:51.387]  Right.
[01:01:51.768 --> 01:01:51.948]  No.
[01:01:52.228 --> 01:01:53.709]  Border Patrol and National Guard.
[01:01:54.310 --> 01:02:06.460]  The source that I spoke with, that was a National Guard source about the kids, and they were literally telling me that some of their co-workers have asked to be taken off the assignment of working with those children because it was so traumatizing to them.
[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:08.762]  I mean, that's the level it's got to be.
[01:02:08.782 --> 01:02:11.044]  And you were saying they're seeing them again and again.
[01:02:11.064 --> 01:02:12.745]  I mean, what's going on there?
[01:02:12.785 --> 01:02:13.946]  Again and again.
[01:02:13.986 --> 01:02:18.590]  They said literally within two to three weeks, they're cycling back through them again.
[01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:19.611]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:02:20.233 --> 01:02:20.959]  Speak more to that.
[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:21.605]  That's huge.
[01:02:22.808 --> 01:02:23.008]  Right.
[01:02:23.348 --> 01:02:30.052]  So the way they described it was, right, the kids come across, and these were mostly unaccompanied minors that we're speaking of, right?
[01:02:30.932 --> 01:02:32.433]  Some weren't even being used.
[01:02:32.473 --> 01:02:34.494]  These were just literally unaccompanied minors.
[01:02:34.855 --> 01:02:42.499]  And one of the things that they were thinking of, the theory was, that some of these kids are being used as drug smugglers, right?
[01:02:42.799 --> 01:02:52.244]  And so they bring them across, they give them drugs, they come across, and then as soon as they're released, they meet up with the cartels and then transport
[01:02:52.264 --> 01:02:53.544]  So they think they're mulling these kids?
[01:02:53.564 --> 01:02:53.544]  100%.
[01:02:53.604 --> 01:02:57.965]  That's the exact word that they describe, that they're using them as mules.
[01:02:57.985 --> 01:02:58.065]  Yes.
[01:03:22.045 --> 01:03:23.066]  You can't make this up.
[01:03:23.086 --> 01:03:24.748]  We know the Democratic Party's getting a big cut.
[01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:28.671]  Somebody's making a lot of money of it, for sure.
[01:03:28.792 --> 01:03:33.396]  And obviously, this whole immigration bit is big business.
[01:03:34.898 --> 01:03:42.345]  And it's a little bit... When we went down to Mission Border Hope here yesterday in El Paso, in Eagle Pass, right?
[01:03:43.125 --> 01:03:47.309]  They immediately sent security guards out to confront us and said, you have to leave this property.
[01:03:47.329 --> 01:03:49.671]  They didn't want to show the migrants being processed in there.
[01:03:49.931 --> 01:03:56.177]  So we went to a check cashing place and a money exchange place that was next door, separate property.
[01:03:56.577 --> 01:04:03.904]  And the security guards still followed us and told us, no, you can't stand there either because we own that check cashing facility as well.
[01:04:04.344 --> 01:04:04.664]  Wow.
[01:04:04.684 --> 01:04:13.412]  So a Christian charity claims to own a money exchange and check cashing place as well as processing migrants.
[01:04:13.472 --> 01:04:16.795]  They're farming these people.
[01:04:16.815 --> 01:04:16.795]  100%.
[01:04:17.415 --> 01:04:22.259]  This is a huge billions of dollar a year operation.
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:32.568]  And it's probably at this point, my guess would be it's actually surpassing narcotics as far as the amount of money that's involved around the globe with human trafficking.
[01:04:32.568 --> 01:04:33.449]  All right, we're going to break.
[01:04:33.469 --> 01:04:39.012]  I want to come back and talk about big picture and all the different angles that I haven't raised that you want to raise here, Tim.
[01:04:39.633 --> 01:04:41.314]  We're blessed to have you and the crew down there.
[01:04:41.334 --> 01:04:43.035]  Chase Geiser has filed reports as well.
[01:04:43.395 --> 01:04:45.757]  We're going to get him on to respond.
[01:04:45.897 --> 01:04:47.438]  We're also looking at the economy coming up.
[01:04:48.198 --> 01:04:49.659]  But this is God's work, folks.
[01:04:49.679 --> 01:04:50.660]  This is so important.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.361]  I'm so blessed to be here, so honored to work with a crew like this.
[01:04:53.742 --> 01:04:55.403]  Thank you, listeners, for having us on air.
[01:04:55.783 --> 01:04:56.924]  All this work is because of you.
[01:05:01.089 --> 01:05:02.330]  Gunther in Tennessee.
[01:05:02.370 --> 01:05:03.371]  Thanks for calling, Gunther.
[01:05:03.391 --> 01:05:03.931]  Hey, Alex.
[01:05:04.112 --> 01:05:04.872]  First time caller.
[01:05:04.952 --> 01:05:06.794]  Real quick, wanted to plug your foundational energy.
[01:05:07.354 --> 01:05:08.295]  Just started taking that.
[01:05:08.956 --> 01:05:13.280]  And, boy, three pills, recommended dose, I was bouncing off the walls.
[01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:19.024]  But I tell you, foundational is the right name for that product because I'll cut down to one.
[01:05:20.145 --> 01:05:23.909]  It's like you have a baseline of energy that you were missing before that you got back.
[01:05:24.029 --> 01:05:24.109]  So...
[01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:32.551]  Well, I'm glad you mentioned that because it's methylfolate, the breakdown of folic acid, and a lot of people, particularly Europeans, don't absorb all of the folic acid.
[01:05:32.791 --> 01:05:33.892]  So it's not a stimulant.
[01:05:34.092 --> 01:05:37.513]  It's a totally natural thing that boosts energy that's foundational.
[01:05:37.813 --> 01:05:40.354]  And was I lying to you or did it not work?
[01:05:41.054 --> 01:05:42.234]  No, it was top-notch.
[01:05:42.294 --> 01:05:45.915]  And I was actually taking Red Pill Plus before, and that's got a little folic acid in it.
[01:05:45.975 --> 01:05:49.756]  I think there was a little buildup from this, but the energy from this was no jitters.
[01:05:49.956 --> 01:05:50.857]  I mean, it's top-notch.
[01:05:50.877 --> 01:05:51.677]  It's a great product.
[01:05:52.093 --> 01:05:53.053]  Well, thank you so much.
[01:05:53.093 --> 01:05:56.855]  Yeah, no, folic acid's great and it's in real red pill, but some can't break it down.
[01:05:56.895 --> 01:05:57.915]  This is the breakdown of it.
[01:05:57.955 --> 01:05:58.755]  That's exactly it.
[01:06:00.876 --> 01:06:03.257]  Lines of the Information War.
[01:06:03.817 --> 01:06:05.218]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:24.617 --> 01:06:30.320]  We're good to go.
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.901]  We're good to go.
[01:06:52.170 --> 01:06:52.951]  We're good to go.
[01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:08.131]  Outside of January 6th, with this, there's a major fight at the NSA.
[01:07:08.151 --> 01:07:09.892]  That is directly from high-level sources.
[01:07:10.532 --> 01:07:12.253]  And we have the huge human trafficking.
[01:07:12.653 --> 01:07:14.214]  We have it all coming out.
[01:07:14.314 --> 01:07:16.216]  And children being taken.
[01:07:16.296 --> 01:07:17.456]  I saw this in the news years ago.
[01:07:17.476 --> 01:07:18.117]  Now it's confirmed.
[01:07:18.637 --> 01:07:20.958]  Over and over again is a free ticket as mules.
[01:07:21.539 --> 01:07:23.360]  And the Border Patrol ordered not to investigate.
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:26.141]  Biden, six months ago, ended the DNA testing.
[01:07:26.201 --> 01:07:26.922]  It's like $100.
[01:07:27.242 --> 01:07:27.862]  Takes a day.
[01:07:28.202 --> 01:07:31.965]  This kid doesn't look like your... They can tell it's your mother, father, cousin.
[01:07:32.785 --> 01:07:33.365]  We're good to go.
[01:07:57.543 --> 01:07:58.624]  We're good to go.
[01:08:22.387 --> 01:08:23.993]  You work for State Department.
[01:08:24.334 --> 01:08:25.216]  You've seen it all.
[01:08:25.477 --> 01:08:26.380]  You've been around the world.
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:28.527]  Have you ever seen anything like this?
[01:08:29.933 --> 01:08:30.233]  Nothing.
[01:08:30.853 --> 01:08:42.898]  I mean, even in countries where we were at war at, we did a better job patrolling and securing the borders of those countries than we are doing here in the United States on our southern border.
[01:08:43.978 --> 01:08:45.478]  It's just incredible, right?
[01:08:45.839 --> 01:08:55.522]  And, you know, speaking with the PIO, the press information officer from the Texas National Guard, Shelby Park, just a couple days ago, you know, he admitted, he said, listen,
[01:08:56.643 --> 01:08:59.484]  We're glad that Governor Abbott is utilizing us down here.
[01:08:59.544 --> 01:09:00.725]  We want to make a difference.
[01:09:01.025 --> 01:09:02.886]  We want to help secure our country.
[01:09:03.207 --> 01:09:09.911]  He's like, but at the end of the day, because I asked him, I said, you know, I'm glad that you guys secured Shelby Park so well.
[01:09:10.191 --> 01:09:15.234]  I said, but I've been just three miles outside of Eagle Pass, and there's no barriers at all.
[01:09:15.274 --> 01:09:15.975]  There's no wall.
[01:09:16.015 --> 01:09:16.815]  There's no bar.
[01:09:16.835 --> 01:09:17.536]  There's no troops.
[01:09:17.576 --> 01:09:18.136]  There's nothing.
[01:09:18.676 --> 01:09:25.579]  And he said, well, listen, despite the size of the Texas National Guard, he said, we do have limited resources.
[01:09:25.979 --> 01:09:28.680]  And so we're forced because the federal government's not helping.
[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:31.942]  Yeah, so that said, at least, Abbott, give us your real assessment then.
[01:09:32.342 --> 01:09:33.382]  Is this just a show?
[01:09:33.803 --> 01:09:35.263]  You've got 25 states behind us?
[01:09:35.643 --> 01:09:36.944]  Or is Abbott doing the best he can?
[01:09:38.626 --> 01:09:39.807]  I think it's a combination.
[01:09:39.988 --> 01:09:47.874]  Obviously, I do think that Governor Abbott wants to make a political statement with this, but the National Guard Major was very clear with me.
[01:09:47.934 --> 01:10:01.105]  He said, listen, you can look at the numbers of my deployed troops, and unfortunately, there's only so many of us, and we have a budget, and there's only so much Texas by itself can do financially to support this whole operation.
[01:10:01.465 --> 01:10:02.006]  I think so.
[01:10:18.724 --> 01:10:21.187]  It's an extremely low water crossing most of the year.
[01:10:21.207 --> 01:10:38.006]  Now, one of the interesting things that happened, Alex, is that the day that we were there, just one day previous, on Monday, somebody, and nobody has gotten to the point of who gave this authorization, someone opened a dams.
[01:10:38.593 --> 01:10:44.139]  To sit there and flood the Rio Grande and make the current as swift as possible.
[01:10:44.259 --> 01:10:46.542]  And now people have drowned, they've saved children.
[01:10:46.842 --> 01:10:48.284]  That shows the technocracy.
[01:10:48.344 --> 01:10:49.365]  Who's in control of it?
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:53.841]  Three bodies, three bodies, and just in time we were here, Alex.
[01:10:53.901 --> 01:11:01.565]  So that morning when we were there, an unconscious, a toddler had gotten fallen out into the river, separated from her parents, the National Guard.
[01:11:01.605 --> 01:11:04.446]  By the time they got to her, she was hypothermic and unconscious.
[01:11:04.886 --> 01:11:07.907]  Luckily, they were able to save her and get her to a hospital.
[01:11:08.147 --> 01:11:14.650]  But two more bodies that day and the next day that they weren't able to save that were already drowned.
[01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:15.611]  We're good to go.
[01:11:35.234 --> 01:11:36.316]  We're good to go.
[01:11:36.336 --> 01:11:36.556]  I think?
[01:11:52.618 --> 01:11:54.519]  So it shows, oh, Biden doesn't want attention on this.
[01:12:09.589 --> 01:12:14.934]  100%.
[01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:14.934]  He is still trying to play the game that there's not that many migrants coming across.
[01:12:15.435 --> 01:12:16.816]  And it's obviously a lie.
[01:12:17.216 --> 01:12:19.378]  That's why I love the convoy.
[01:12:19.418 --> 01:12:19.799]  They're great.
[01:12:19.819 --> 01:12:22.421]  I hope they don't just sit out at some ranch and barbecue.
[01:12:22.882 --> 01:12:26.665]  If they just spread out and get video, the illegals are coming through different points.
[01:12:26.705 --> 01:12:27.366]  We've seen that.
[01:12:27.826 --> 01:12:29.067]  We need eyes and ears.
[01:12:29.127 --> 01:12:31.389]  And again, it's not like January 6th where it's one capital.
[01:12:31.690 --> 01:12:32.530]  They're setting us up.
[01:12:32.911 --> 01:12:34.152]  This is our territory.
[01:12:34.192 --> 01:12:35.073]  We're in control here.
[01:12:36.047 --> 01:12:36.247]  Right.
[01:12:36.688 --> 01:12:39.249]  And like you said, you know, the funding for all this, right?
[01:12:39.529 --> 01:12:40.530]  Who is funding?
[01:12:40.730 --> 01:12:46.815]  This is a multi, multi-billion dollar operation to smuggle this many millions of people into this country.
[01:12:47.115 --> 01:12:55.861]  You know, just in the five minutes that we moved locations and came to this new location, we found this debit card, right, from Banco del Pacifico.
[01:12:56.301 --> 01:12:58.563]  With a Hispanic female's name on it, right?
[01:12:59.003 --> 01:12:59.884]  And they're everywhere.
[01:12:59.904 --> 01:13:01.745]  They're littered along the border everywhere.
[01:13:02.005 --> 01:13:03.946]  Somebody's providing them these debit cards.
[01:13:04.006 --> 01:13:05.447]  Somebody's providing them the clothing.
[01:13:05.507 --> 01:13:09.330]  Somebody's providing them the hygiene items, the phones, everything.
[01:13:09.630 --> 01:13:12.432]  This is billions and billions of dollars, right?
[01:13:13.032 --> 01:13:19.837]  And it's not going to stop until there's a political will to turn that financial spigot off.
[01:13:21.897 --> 01:13:26.143]  All right, let's get Chase Geiser in here, InfoWars reporter.
[01:13:26.423 --> 01:13:27.324]  I appreciate you.
[01:13:27.344 --> 01:13:31.109]  I don't want to even keep you on air because you've got all these other sources.
[01:13:31.610 --> 01:13:33.172]  We're waiting for an imminent attack.
[01:13:33.252 --> 01:13:35.415]  The feds say, let's talk about this briefly.
[01:13:35.835 --> 01:13:39.019]  You were shown by the Border Patrol the memo.
[01:13:40.061 --> 01:13:49.730]  I mean, so this is not speculation that the feds are saying imminent white supremacist attack against the Border Patrol and quote migrants, so they evacuated the migrants God knows where.
[01:13:50.031 --> 01:13:55.036]  That is a big piece of intel as the pretext to bring in the NSA spying if the NSA is bucking.
[01:13:57.654 --> 01:13:57.834]  Right.
[01:13:58.074 --> 01:14:00.796]  Yeah, I mean, literally showed me the actual FBI memo.
[01:14:01.456 --> 01:14:06.460]  He didn't feel comfortable giving me a copy of it, but he did let me view it and read it, and that's exactly what it said.
[01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:18.347]  Two white supremacists, sometime between February 2nd and February 5th, we're going to attack the main Border Patrol processing, migrant processing facility on Firefly Lane.
[01:14:21.409 --> 01:14:24.171]  Tim, in closing, what's your assessment of the situation down there?
[01:14:25.495 --> 01:14:28.678]  Well, I do think that there is people in D.C.
[01:14:28.718 --> 01:14:36.304]  that are hoping or either hoping for or actively instigating a spark to happen down here.
[01:14:36.424 --> 01:14:41.908]  And that's why I know you said you don't want people to sit there and just hang out and barbecue.
[01:14:41.948 --> 01:14:45.311]  And we do need as many cameras on this situation as possible.
[01:14:45.571 --> 01:14:54.578]  But what I'm hearing from the people in the convoy is that the location where they're going to hold their rally is going to be a number of miles away from
[01:14:54.938 --> 01:14:58.681]  But the good news is the Border Patrol and others are worried about a false flag.
[01:14:58.701 --> 01:15:00.502]  They know what to look for.
[01:15:18.261 --> 01:15:39.831]  And my source, Elias, that's exactly the word he used, false flag, because he said this isn't the first time they've gotten this from the FBI, that when the Haitians were here two years ago, that the same type of FBI memo was released then when a lot of Americans and a lot of press started making its way to the border to document what the Haitians were up to there under the bridge.
[01:15:40.387 --> 01:15:40.587]  Yes, sir.
[01:15:40.607 --> 01:15:41.187]  I just mumbled that number.
[01:15:41.207 --> 01:15:41.807]  That's a real number.
[01:15:41.827 --> 01:15:43.608]  We just say it like it's no big deal.
[01:16:09.013 --> 01:16:14.495]  Globalists will use carbon controls to stop you from growing your own food.
[01:16:14.835 --> 01:16:20.757]  They're announcing that farms and private gardens are evil and plants are bad.
[01:16:21.217 --> 01:16:24.378]  This is on Infowars.com, official UNWF.
[01:16:24.878 --> 01:16:27.179]  This is actually happening.
[01:16:28.839 --> 01:16:29.119]  All right?
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:32.721]  So the Epoch Times has put out a report.
[01:16:34.735 --> 01:16:38.938]  With Alex Newman on, no farmers, no food, you will eat the bugs.
[01:16:39.358 --> 01:16:41.199]  This is how evil these people are.
[01:16:41.599 --> 01:16:52.125]  Fentanyl's fine, pedophilia's fine, but cabbage and tomatoes and zucchini and everything is evil.
[01:16:52.366 --> 01:16:52.726]  Here it is.
[01:16:53.993 --> 01:16:58.036]  At some point down the line, the narrative changed to be around climate.
[01:16:58.396 --> 01:17:00.157]  What was the narrative prior to that?
[01:17:00.197 --> 01:17:05.401]  What was the justification they were giving in order to push this kind of more control from the top down?
[01:17:06.081 --> 01:17:14.066]  Immediately preceding climate and environment, actually the Cold War was the pretext for having this incredibly large, incredibly powerful federal government.
[01:17:14.347 --> 01:17:23.152]  In fact, you see a very clear break when the Club of Rome met in 1991 as the Soviet state and the Eastern European communist states
[01:17:23.953 --> 01:17:24.413]  Wait, what?
[01:17:49.321 --> 01:17:50.582]  I could not believe what I just heard.
[01:17:51.343 --> 01:17:57.268]  Did world leaders really lay out this globalist plan in plain English, in a physical book, way back in 1991?
[01:17:57.308 --> 01:18:00.832]  I went on Amazon, and there it was.
[01:18:01.452 --> 01:18:15.024]  The first global revolution, which states, and I quote, "...in searching for a common enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine, and the like, would fit the bill."
[01:18:15.825 --> 01:18:19.047]  And therefore, the real enemy is humanity itself.
[01:18:20.508 --> 01:18:21.649]  The science is clear.
[01:18:22.409 --> 01:18:25.852]  We are getting dangerously close to the point of no return.
[01:18:27.199 --> 01:18:28.480]  The science is very clear.
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:32.082]  This natural world is severely endangered.
[01:18:32.142 --> 01:18:35.625]  Code Red for Humanity is not a group of political officials, elected officials.
[01:18:35.945 --> 01:18:36.905]  These are the scientists.
[01:18:37.226 --> 01:18:42.689]  There is a top-down quality to this policy, which is extremely forceful.
[01:18:42.949 --> 01:18:48.413]  And the forcefulness comes from scientism, which is the ideology that we understand the world for.
[01:18:48.473 --> 01:18:49.754]  Fully because of science.
[01:18:49.875 --> 01:18:53.679]  We have to listen to the science so that we have a better future for tomorrow.
[01:18:53.699 --> 01:18:56.462]  This is just ideological BS.
[01:18:56.962 --> 01:18:58.324]  And it's also quite dangerous.
[01:18:58.484 --> 01:19:04.470]  It's a dangerous way of looking at the world because then it means nothing matters apart from science.
[01:19:05.251 --> 01:19:06.172]  Culture doesn't matter.
[01:19:06.332 --> 01:19:07.312]  History doesn't matter.
[01:19:07.392 --> 01:19:08.553]  Religion doesn't matter.
[01:19:08.613 --> 01:19:10.014]  Social interaction doesn't matter.
[01:19:10.134 --> 01:19:12.195]  Nothing matters but science.
[01:19:12.736 --> 01:19:19.640]  You don't need to be a theologian or philosopher to understand that that's complete nonsense, but also dangerous nonsense.
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:25.384]  If nothing matters than just science, then what kind of a world do we actually live in?
[01:19:26.226 --> 01:19:30.167]  History is truly at a turning point.
[01:19:31.207 --> 01:19:38.490]  In times of crisis, the role of governments is more important and more relevant than ever.
[01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:43.051]  The World Economic Forum was actually a critical part of implementing this UN agenda.
[01:19:43.331 --> 01:19:48.893]  Some years ago, they became a strategic partner of the UN in the implementation of Agenda 2030.
[01:19:49.973 --> 01:19:53.016]  And then you start looking at the connections between the World Economic Forum and China.
[01:19:53.316 --> 01:19:55.578]  Klaus Schwab and Xi Jinping, they're like old buddies.
[01:19:55.618 --> 01:19:57.839]  They put out press releases about how much they love each other.
[01:19:57.859 --> 01:20:04.505]  So you've got the super capitalists represented by the World Economic Forum, and then on the government side you have communists.
[01:20:04.565 --> 01:20:12.811]  After Agenda 2030 was adopted, the Communist Party in China put out, through all their propaganda organs, they said, we played a critical role in this Agenda 2030.
[01:20:12.871 --> 01:20:17.255]  You had Javier Solana, the head of NATO, saying this was going to be the next great leap forward.
[01:20:17.757 --> 01:20:19.884]  The last Great Leap Forward in China killed millions of people.
[01:20:19.964 --> 01:20:21.308]  Why would we want another one of those?
[01:20:21.328 --> 01:20:21.810]  That's crazy.
[01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:36.252]  So you have communists and super capitalists all coming together and working on this one sustainable development agenda.
[01:20:36.752 --> 01:20:40.993]  And that should make us all pause and say, wait a minute, that doesn't make sense on the surface.
[01:20:41.013 --> 01:20:41.794]  What's going on here?
[01:20:42.094 --> 01:20:52.136]  China is a powerful example of what can be achieved when national governments make environmental protection a top priority.
[01:20:52.437 --> 01:20:57.678]  The motivations of those who are pushing this agenda, many of them tend to emulate countries like China.
[01:20:57.918 --> 01:20:58.639]  We're good to go.
[01:21:05.490 --> 01:21:08.333]  Lakes and streams, there's all sorts of toxins pouring into them.
[01:21:08.893 --> 01:21:20.102]  In actuality, I would say their envy of China is more to do with their control over their population and control over politics than it has to do with the environment.
[01:21:20.122 --> 01:21:28.229]  In looking at this, it looks like the environment's a tool to achieve power more than it is an end goal of itself to actually protect nature.
[01:21:30.171 --> 01:21:33.554]  We're doing incredibly important work, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:35.256 --> 01:21:36.236]  We believe in humanity.
[01:21:36.256 --> 01:21:37.477]  We're not out to screw people over.
[01:21:37.497 --> 01:21:40.718]  We believe in prosperity and free market and the Christian ethos.
[01:21:41.278 --> 01:21:43.759]  Chase Geiser's been there for three, four days at the border.
[01:21:44.419 --> 01:21:45.619]  He's seen incredible things.
[01:21:45.719 --> 01:21:52.322]  Wow, he's right in the middle of such a giant story that if listeners get excited about this at Real Alex Jones and Infowars.com.
[01:21:53.829 --> 01:21:55.670]  It's absolutely crazy, Alex, and overwhelming.
[01:21:55.710 --> 01:21:57.871]  You know, it's really interesting.
[01:21:57.891 --> 01:22:00.212]  You just mentioned the sort of schism happening between
[01:22:20.996 --> 01:22:21.717]  We're good to go.
[01:22:41.494 --> 01:22:44.075]  To me, it strikes me as indicative of a schism.
[01:22:44.095 --> 01:22:50.297]  There's black hats and white hats within these intelligence communities, whether it's the NSA, whether it's the CIA or the FBI.
[01:22:50.577 --> 01:23:00.281]  I think they're constantly at war with one another on whether or not they're going to take this Machiavellian approach to leadership or they're going to try to do the right thing always by the American people.
[01:23:00.301 --> 01:23:05.303]  And so to hear that there's this schism happening right now, this controversy, this conflict at Fort Meade,
[01:23:05.723 --> 01:23:06.223]  Well, let's be clear.
[01:23:06.283 --> 01:23:08.484]  It's about targeting the American people as terrorists.
[01:23:08.504 --> 01:23:10.304]  It's about legitimizing that whole rollout.
[01:23:10.324 --> 01:23:14.065]  The fact the NSA's fighting it, the Border Patrol's fighting it, is a beautiful thing.
[01:23:14.085 --> 01:23:15.326]  What are you guys going to be covering next?
[01:23:33.564 --> 01:23:45.269]  Well, today we are doing everything we can to get notifications or news or insight as to what's developing specifically with this FBI warning at the facility on Firefly Lane here.
[01:23:45.529 --> 01:23:50.371]  We're also going to be exploring whether or not there's any migrant crossings that we're going to be able to capture or follow as well.
[01:23:50.671 --> 01:23:59.055]  Shelby Park has been restricted by Major Mike Perry, which is the first time we've seen the park restricted both to the public and the media.
[01:23:59.075 --> 01:24:01.156]  And they're using that, what I think is a false...
[01:24:01.656 --> 01:24:06.497]  They're using that false, I believe false, FBI report of white supremacist imminent attack.
[01:24:06.877 --> 01:24:08.518]  And by the way, why is that in the news?
[01:24:08.758 --> 01:24:10.078]  Because they want to do it behind the scenes.
[01:24:11.559 --> 01:24:12.259]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:24:12.279 --> 01:24:13.379]  You know, it is interesting, though.
[01:24:13.419 --> 01:24:22.761]  They mentioned specifically militiamen, and we have noticed several militias that are coming into the community here from all over the United States, too, specifically.
[01:24:22.781 --> 01:24:24.522]  And again, we're not against the militia.
[01:24:24.542 --> 01:24:25.462]  It's constitutional.
[01:24:25.502 --> 01:24:26.662]  But is it like Whitmer?
[01:24:27.342 --> 01:24:29.063]  Are these really feds posing as militia?
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:39.104]  Well, I find it hard to believe, Alex, that there's a single militia in the United States that hasn't been infiltrated, at least in some way, by a federal agent from one of the three-letter agencies.
[01:24:39.364 --> 01:24:44.986]  Just as a matter of national security, I would find it incredibly hard to believe they wouldn't be involved in each of these organizations.
[01:24:45.286 --> 01:24:55.411]  And in the event that this FBI warning is true, which it could very well be a false flag, like you mentioned, but in the event that it's true, I imagine that the intel that they have would be because they have somebody on the inside of the militia.
[01:24:56.731 --> 01:24:57.152]  Absolutely.
[01:24:57.172 --> 01:24:59.953]  The few minutes we have left, what else is on your radar down there at the border?
[01:25:01.721 --> 01:25:08.885]  Well, today we're going to be scouring every location and following up with some leads that we've gotten about where certain crossings are happening.
[01:25:08.905 --> 01:25:17.490]  It seems that the actual crossings, Alex, are happening further and further away from Eagle Pass specifically since all this attention has come on this specific community here.
[01:25:17.790 --> 01:25:25.114]  So we're going to be going further and further out in the surrounding area up against the river to try to see if we can capture any of these migrants who are crossing.
[01:25:25.374 --> 01:25:28.176]  And we'll be following up with leads that we have from several of the locals as well.
[01:25:28.871 --> 01:25:31.413]  Well, I don't think O'Biden is very happy right now.
[01:25:32.293 --> 01:25:34.375]  Because their whole operation is being blown wide open.
[01:25:35.856 --> 01:25:37.898]  Their whole operation is being blown wide open.
[01:25:38.278 --> 01:25:49.866]  It's amazing the level of incompetence that we see from the Biden administration, not only in terms of their actual leadership and their actual policies that they advocate, but in terms of their inability to sort of cover up their own screw-up.
[01:25:49.906 --> 01:25:52.508]  They're constantly screwing up, constantly lying about it.
[01:25:52.848 --> 01:25:55.010]  And it would be funny if it wasn't so terrible, Alex.
[01:25:56.013 --> 01:25:58.796]  All right, I've got a lot of questions, but what else is on your radar?
[01:26:00.517 --> 01:26:07.603]  Well, today we're going to really focus on keeping an eye on this story as it develops on Firefly Lane.
[01:26:07.923 --> 01:26:20.094]  Our prayer here is that nothing actually happens in this facility, that there is no attack, because in the event that there is an attack, whether it's a legitimate attack or a false flag attack, Alex, it's only going to make the MAGA movement look bad, the America movement.
[01:26:20.254 --> 01:26:24.916]  Right-wing extremists, white supremacists, and this only serves that narrative when there are these attacks.
[01:26:24.956 --> 01:26:26.756]  And so any sort of militia that would desire to do something,
[01:26:40.401 --> 01:26:40.821]  Alex Jones Show!
[01:26:40.841 --> 01:26:41.342]  We're good to go.
[01:26:41.362 --> 01:26:41.502]  I think?
[01:27:04.275 --> 01:27:16.689]  Peaceful, civil disobedience only when necessary, no violence, only self-defense, and just getting our country back through legal means, through righteous means, and through those means that are protected by the Bill of Rights in our Constitution, Alex.
[01:27:17.677 --> 01:27:18.177]  Well, that's right.
[01:27:18.258 --> 01:27:23.902]  I put an ex-post out, formerly Twitter, about some silly, funny thing against 5 million views.
[01:27:23.962 --> 01:27:28.306]  But this has got only a few million views today on ex-Eril Alex Jones.
[01:27:28.726 --> 01:27:29.867]  This is a big deal.
[01:27:29.927 --> 01:27:38.794]  This is the feds saying white supremacists with no evidence are about to attack, evacuating people, doing all this to cover up Biden's open border.
[01:27:39.195 --> 01:27:41.457]  This story needs to be number one.
[01:27:41.937 --> 01:27:45.300]  How would you, in a 60-second summation, describe the story you're covering?
[01:27:46.866 --> 01:27:51.788]  I would say that what we have captured is a false flag operation before it happened.
[01:27:51.988 --> 01:27:58.711]  We say on this network a lot of times, while other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[01:27:59.211 --> 01:28:02.793]  And this is an example of something that's about to happen, that has yet to happen.
[01:28:03.093 --> 01:28:10.496]  Hopefully we can get the word out enough, prevent it from happening, similar to what happened in September with the mask mandate warning that we were able to send out about
[01:28:10.936 --> 01:28:13.258]  If everybody can reshare that, that'll make all the difference in the world, I think.
[01:28:37.555 --> 01:28:38.115]  Absolutely.
[01:28:38.175 --> 01:28:49.381]  We're down there in real time with good patriots in our government exposing the fact that the Border Patrol believes they're trying to stage a false flag and it's got to be shaken up the establishment that hopefully we can stop them from doing it.
[01:28:49.461 --> 01:28:50.361]  That's our main mission.
[01:28:50.661 --> 01:28:51.762]  Chase Geiser, Godspeed.

[01:29:58.266 --> 01:30:01.790]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[01:30:02.191 --> 01:30:09.199]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[01:30:09.379 --> 01:30:11.381]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[01:30:11.562 --> 01:30:12.623]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[01:30:12.643 --> 01:30:13.364]  He loved the idea.
[01:30:13.684 --> 01:30:17.207]  What would you call the debate and discussion about a pro-human future?
[01:30:17.227 --> 01:30:18.108]  Team Humanity?
[01:30:18.168 --> 01:30:19.049]  Yes, Team Humanity.
[01:30:19.209 --> 01:30:19.650]  Absolutely.
[01:30:19.970 --> 01:30:21.351]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[01:30:21.431 --> 01:30:24.875]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[01:30:25.095 --> 01:30:32.542]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser you've enforced on the air so you can promote and support Team Humanity.
[01:30:32.802 --> 01:30:44.532]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a revolution against the globalists, and it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[01:30:44.812 --> 01:30:46.133]  We're told humans are the problem.
[01:30:46.153 --> 01:30:47.154]  We're told we're killing the Earth.
[01:30:47.434 --> 01:30:51.698]  We're told all this garbage so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[01:30:51.998 --> 01:30:52.699]  We're not going to do that.
[01:30:52.959 --> 01:30:57.583]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[01:30:58.539 --> 01:31:05.082]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the globalist agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[01:31:05.162 --> 01:31:19.290]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections masquerading as vaccines.
[01:31:20.208 --> 01:31:24.460]  It is so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives oblivious.
[01:31:25.764 --> 01:31:28.531]  And you realize ignorance is not bliss, it equals death.
[01:31:30.131 --> 01:31:50.562]  But people are starting to really understand how serious things are, and that's a hard thing to do, because to wake up to a disturbing reality and realize that we're in the middle of a giant biological weapons war against humanity, and that there's mass sterilization that's already taking place, cutting off all the major energy sources, is really hard to deal with, but it's the reality.
[01:31:51.122 --> 01:31:55.304]  Facing it is our only chance to turn this around, because stuff's about to get really, really nasty.
[01:31:55.704 --> 01:31:56.345]  Infowars.com
[01:31:58.331 --> 01:32:03.634]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing, high-quality coffee has not been available.
[01:32:04.074 --> 01:32:08.456]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[01:32:08.897 --> 01:32:11.378]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[01:32:11.938 --> 01:32:21.323]  But now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.
[01:32:21.523 --> 01:32:24.105]  It's powered by the company Minuteman Coffee.
[01:32:24.745 --> 01:32:32.787]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best-tasting, best-smelling, strongest coffee that I have ever drank.
[01:32:33.267 --> 01:32:34.667]  It is game-changing.
[01:32:35.127 --> 01:32:37.308]  All you've got to do is buy a bag of it and try it.
[01:32:37.368 --> 01:32:40.468]  I know you're going to be hooked, which will then fund your Operation A360 win.

[01:32:44.749 --> 01:32:45.529]  That's the strongest.
[01:32:45.789 --> 01:32:48.190]  The amazing medium roast wig of America.
[01:32:48.650 --> 01:32:55.899]  And finally, the best tasting dark roast tip of the spear, now exclusively available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:32:56.159 --> 01:32:56.980]  Get your coffee now.
[01:33:00.925 --> 01:33:06.813]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:15.203 --> 01:33:20.174]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:21.630 --> 01:33:30.654]  So the criminals that hijacked the federal government are saying white supremacists are imminently about to attack illegal aliens at the border and the Border Patrol.
[01:33:30.694 --> 01:33:34.115]  The Border Patrol is meeting with us saying it's all a giant lie.
[01:33:34.455 --> 01:33:35.595]  They believe it's a false flag.
[01:33:35.655 --> 01:33:38.337]  The NSA is refusing to turn on face-scanning cameras.
[01:33:38.417 --> 01:33:38.937]  It's illegal.
[01:33:39.357 --> 01:33:41.798]  This is like huge stories within huge stories.
[01:33:42.398 --> 01:33:44.399]  And we'll have more on this as it unfolds.
[01:33:44.539 --> 01:33:49.321]  Our guys are dialed in, have the trust of the state and the feds.
[01:33:50.498 --> 01:33:51.019]  It's incredible.
[01:34:06.363 --> 01:34:06.543]  No BS.
[01:34:06.563 --> 01:34:07.264]  This is the place to go.
[01:34:23.374 --> 01:34:24.875]  K-E-P-M.
[01:34:24.915 --> 01:34:28.796]  That's K-E-P-M dot com forward slash gold or 720-605-3900.
[01:34:28.917 --> 01:34:31.238]  But listeners love him.
[01:34:31.538 --> 01:34:38.201]  So I was going to have him on like once a month and do some basic sponsorship stuff, but the listeners love him.
[01:34:38.621 --> 01:34:39.781]  And he's a great analyst.
[01:34:39.841 --> 01:34:40.762]  I think he's dead on.
[01:34:41.162 --> 01:34:46.544]  So K-E-P-M dot com forward slash gold or 720-605-3900.
[01:34:46.564 --> 01:34:47.685]  So important to get prepared as best you can.
[01:34:53.137 --> 01:34:58.803]  Giving us a prelude, you sent me a giant analysis of talking points and key points and PowerPoints.
[01:34:58.823 --> 01:35:15.380]  We'll be covering tomorrow, noon central, at InfoWars.com forward slash show and relax Jones on X. But this article you sent me a week ago, from dystopia to utopia and gold and silver, the claims that inflation's beat, what's really going on, give us a prelude of what's coming up tomorrow at noon central.
[01:35:16.815 --> 01:35:22.079]  So, there is so much, Alex, since we talked last when I was on the show.
[01:35:22.619 --> 01:35:33.908]  So, the biggest news for silver, and everybody who's watching this show who's invested in gold, silver over the last couple of years is going to be really happy about this.
[01:35:33.968 --> 01:35:34.108]  So...
[01:35:34.688 --> 01:35:37.433]  We all know that there's been manipulation in the markets.
[01:35:37.493 --> 01:35:43.625]  You know, when you've got corporations like BlackRock that own the silver ETF, SLV.
[01:35:44.006 --> 01:35:44.927]  Explain that, JP.
[01:35:45.168 --> 01:35:47.192]  Naked shorting to keep it artificially low.
[01:35:48.004 --> 01:35:48.324]  Yeah.
[01:35:48.584 --> 01:35:49.485]  I mean, this is why.
[01:35:50.025 --> 01:35:51.566]  But you look at this naked short.
[01:35:51.606 --> 01:35:52.587]  So how does that work?
[01:35:53.067 --> 01:36:00.132]  So BlackRock will give Chase, JPMorgan Chase, who's basically the custodian of physical metals behind the silver ETF.
[01:36:00.692 --> 01:36:04.495]  They'll say, hey, Chase, you've got to buy 10 million ounces of silver, whatever.
[01:36:04.715 --> 01:36:05.676]  So what does Chase do?
[01:36:05.756 --> 01:36:07.037]  They issue naked shorts.
[01:36:07.117 --> 01:36:08.157]  It drives the price down.
[01:36:08.198 --> 01:36:09.799]  They gobble up a bunch of physical silver.
[01:36:10.199 --> 01:36:11.179]  That creates demand.
[01:36:11.220 --> 01:36:12.120]  The price goes up.
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:13.901]  They don't like it that it gets so high.
[01:36:13.941 --> 01:36:15.262]  They issue more naked shorts.
[01:36:15.342 --> 01:36:16.683]  They buy more physical silver.
[01:36:17.183 --> 01:36:17.764]  So here's the thing.
[01:36:18.964 --> 01:36:23.365]  They're using naked shorts not because they hate silver, but because they love it, right?
[01:36:23.405 --> 01:36:24.706]  And they want to buy it at low prices.
[01:36:24.746 --> 01:36:27.706]  Chinese, all the governments, they're hoarding it.
[01:36:27.726 --> 01:36:29.827]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:36:30.107 --> 01:36:41.330]  I mean, central banks around the world, Alex, are buying gold by not the pound or ounce or by the ton, but literally by the hundreds or thousands of tons.
[01:36:41.710 --> 01:36:42.970]  That's a lot of gold.
[01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:47.231]  So they tell the public don't touch it while they're gobbling it up.
[01:36:48.035 --> 01:36:51.097]  Yeah, and you expose these kind of things all the time.
[01:36:51.137 --> 01:36:53.459]  It's like, don't listen to what they say.
[01:36:53.659 --> 01:36:56.901]  Watch what they do because actions speak louder than words, right?
[01:36:57.401 --> 01:37:01.384]  And they are buying gold like there's nobody's business, right?
[01:37:01.484 --> 01:37:07.268]  So you look at, though, even with manipulation, silver in the year 2000 was like $4.58 an ounce.
[01:37:07.308 --> 01:37:08.709]  Three and a half years ago, it was $11.91.
[01:37:08.769 --> 01:37:09.410]  15, 16 months ago, it was $17.97.
[01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:10.230]  Today, it's over $23.00.
[01:37:17.395 --> 01:37:19.015]  So even... All-time high.
[01:37:19.115 --> 01:37:19.715]  All-time high.
[01:37:20.956 --> 01:37:23.836]  Well, not on silver, but on gold, we're near an all-time high.
[01:37:24.216 --> 01:37:24.956]  But here's the thing.
[01:37:25.376 --> 01:37:31.018]  Even with manipulation, silver's gone from $4.58 an ounce to over $23 in the last 20 years.
[01:37:31.378 --> 01:37:34.478]  Last three and a half years, it's doubled.
[01:37:34.498 --> 01:37:35.458]  $11.91 to over $23.
[01:37:35.898 --> 01:37:36.459]  Good grief.
[01:37:36.859 --> 01:37:38.199]  That's with manipulation.
[01:37:38.239 --> 01:37:41.039]  That's almost 100% return over the last three and a half years.
[01:37:41.059 --> 01:37:42.520]  So what happens when the manipulation ends?
[01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:43.940]  Or how long can they manipulate?
[01:37:44.835 --> 01:37:46.816]  It's through the roof, Alex.
[01:37:46.976 --> 01:37:47.916]  It's through the roof.
[01:37:47.996 --> 01:37:52.719]  Because without manipulation, the price has no check on it, right?
[01:37:53.599 --> 01:37:55.380]  So it's based on supply and demand.
[01:37:55.780 --> 01:38:04.584]  Well, with all of the energy policies that we're seeing, you know, green energy, solar power, EVs, you know, with fuel cell technology, that all requires silver.
[01:38:04.864 --> 01:38:06.405]  Electronics requires silver.
[01:38:06.745 --> 01:38:08.626]  So there's tons of manufacturing demand.
[01:38:08.646 --> 01:38:10.567]  So they can no longer suppress it as good as they could.
[01:38:11.642 --> 01:38:13.843]  Yes, and so here's what's interesting.
[01:38:14.223 --> 01:38:21.004]  This is why this story about the shorts, from Dystopia to Utopia, you have that article.
[01:38:21.965 --> 01:38:28.666]  Biggest news for silver, I think, since I've been in the business since the early 2000s, like it's been 20-something years.
[01:38:29.186 --> 01:38:38.669]  So what happens when you have a short position open and the price of silver goes up, you lose money hand over fist.
[01:38:39.329 --> 01:38:39.749]  I think.
[01:38:59.323 --> 01:39:06.286]  50% of all net short positions in the world were eliminated in one seven-day period.
[01:39:06.326 --> 01:39:09.168]  So for folks that don't do this professionally, what does that signify?
[01:39:10.208 --> 01:39:16.911]  That signifies if you've got these short positions and you think the price is going up, you're going to unravel them fast.
[01:39:17.491 --> 01:39:23.594]  I've never seen 50% of any net short position in any market go away that quickly.
[01:39:23.674 --> 01:39:25.375]  So they're moving way back from shorting.
[01:39:26.806 --> 01:39:28.086]  They've been shortened for a long time.
[01:39:28.486 --> 01:39:29.527]  I mean, really a long time.
[01:39:29.887 --> 01:39:32.387]  So we're talking decades, right?
[01:39:32.807 --> 01:39:45.150]  So when you've got 50% of all open short positions are dismantled and eliminated in one week, that signifies to me that behind the scenes, they're expecting prices to go through the roof.
[01:39:45.210 --> 01:39:49.631]  I was about to say, I'm not a rocket scientist, but if they're getting off shorting silver, that's pretty obvious.
[01:39:50.251 --> 01:39:52.192]  Yeah, because short positions are leveraged.
[01:39:52.653 --> 01:39:54.694]  So it's not just dollar for dollar.
[01:39:55.154 --> 01:39:57.296]  It's highly leveraged.
[01:39:57.616 --> 01:39:59.797]  So they would lose money hand over fist.
[01:39:59.857 --> 01:40:04.260]  So when they get rid of it that quick, that tells me that they think prices are going up.
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:12.726]  So just last week then, silver went from $22.13 to over $23.30 an ounce in about a week.
[01:40:13.126 --> 01:40:16.849]  So this is after these short positions were eliminated.
[01:40:17.309 --> 01:40:19.010]  Silver goes up, what, about 5% in a week?
[01:40:20.391 --> 01:40:25.473]  I mean, you multiply that out by a year, that's, well, 52 weeks in a year.
[01:40:25.553 --> 01:40:29.975]  I mean, we're on pace for like a couple hundred percent growth in silver at that rate, right?
[01:40:29.995 --> 01:40:36.197]  But this tells me that whatever they were expecting to cause silver to go up is starting to happen.
[01:40:36.617 --> 01:40:37.918]  And this is really exciting.
[01:40:37.958 --> 01:40:38.858]  So let's talk about that.
[01:40:38.918 --> 01:40:39.599]  What does that mean?
[01:40:39.619 --> 01:40:40.439]  What do they think is going to happen?
[01:40:41.755 --> 01:40:44.177]  Well, why does silver go up?
[01:40:44.457 --> 01:40:46.138]  Because of inflationary pressures?
[01:40:46.999 --> 01:40:47.779]  Silver is a thing.
[01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:48.560]  Gold is a thing.
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:49.461]  Cars are a thing.
[01:40:49.901 --> 01:40:51.262]  Things go up with inflation.
[01:40:51.302 --> 01:40:54.064]  So they're expecting the inflationary pressures to persist.
[01:40:54.645 --> 01:40:58.768]  So they're lying about inflation, and none of us need to even read a newspaper.
[01:40:59.128 --> 01:41:00.769]  Everybody knows inflation is out of control.
[01:41:00.789 --> 01:41:01.550]  It's not been fixed.
[01:41:02.766 --> 01:41:09.052]  So tomorrow, I want to watch a video of Jerome Powell saying, this economy is good.
[01:41:09.373 --> 01:41:11.335]  We've got inflation in check.
[01:41:11.715 --> 01:41:14.278]  But then Yellen came out two days ago.
[01:41:14.298 --> 01:41:15.138]  We'll skip that clip.
[01:41:15.158 --> 01:41:20.724]  I went to play yesterday, and she said, oh, Americans need to get used to high prices and used to inflation.
[01:41:20.744 --> 01:41:22.846]  So wait, one side's telling us it's all fixed.
[01:41:22.866 --> 01:41:23.887]  The other side's get used to it.
[01:41:25.011 --> 01:41:25.151]  Yeah.
[01:41:25.491 --> 01:41:26.992]  So here's what's interesting, Alex.
[01:41:27.932 --> 01:41:45.096]  A few weeks ago when I was on your show, I said that even though they're promising that interest rates are going to come down over in 2024, I said there's no way that they're going to have prolonged interest rate reductions because they haven't killed the inflationary monster yet.
[01:41:45.376 --> 01:41:46.036]  They have not.
[01:41:46.457 --> 01:41:47.797]  And sure enough, what happened?
[01:41:48.197 --> 01:41:48.617]  We're good to go.
[01:41:48.637 --> 01:41:48.797]  I think?
[01:42:06.167 --> 01:42:09.668]  Because of the BRICS nation taking away demand for the U.S.
[01:42:09.688 --> 01:42:20.831]  dollar globally, what Biden just did, which I want to do a deeper dive on this tomorrow, Biden just put economic sanctions on American companies for the first time I've ever seen.
[01:42:20.891 --> 01:42:22.771]  And now he's going to sanction Israel.
[01:42:23.292 --> 01:42:23.972]  Did you see that?
[01:42:24.532 --> 01:42:25.172]  What is that?
[01:42:25.192 --> 01:42:25.712]  Yes, I did.
[01:42:26.232 --> 01:42:27.633]  So what did he sanction?
[01:42:28.713 --> 01:42:32.857]  Producers of liquefied natural gas in America.
[01:42:32.897 --> 01:42:37.421]  He's basically pausing all applications for exports to the rest of the world.
[01:42:37.541 --> 01:42:38.162]  And that's huge.
[01:42:38.222 --> 01:42:39.723]  People don't know energy is everything.
[01:42:39.783 --> 01:42:41.424]  It's like fertilizer for plants.
[01:42:41.865 --> 01:42:46.289]  Why would he kill mainly Texas industry and say no more liquefied gas export?
[01:42:46.309 --> 01:42:47.109]  I mean, that is huge.
[01:42:47.470 --> 01:42:48.210]  Barely made the news.
[01:42:49.051 --> 01:42:51.232]  Well, he claims it's for climate change, right?
[01:42:51.712 --> 01:43:00.154]  But I think the timing is weird because it's going on during the Texas mayhem that's happening between the feds and the state of Texas, right?
[01:43:00.594 --> 01:43:03.135]  So to me, it looks and smells punitive.
[01:43:03.355 --> 01:43:04.595]  To me, it's like, you know what?
[01:43:04.895 --> 01:43:05.596]  We're going to pause this.
[01:43:05.636 --> 01:43:06.856]  What's going to happen with that?
[01:43:07.316 --> 01:43:10.117]  We are really good in America at oil and gas.
[01:43:10.337 --> 01:43:12.058]  It's one of our specialty areas.
[01:43:12.378 --> 01:43:15.799]  And if he's saying you guys can't do this anymore, you know what?
[01:43:15.959 --> 01:43:21.442]  Economic sanctions, Alex, are usually held as policies against a rogue terrorist nation.
[01:43:21.462 --> 01:43:21.822]  That's right.
[01:43:21.882 --> 01:43:22.202]  War.
[01:43:22.242 --> 01:43:22.722]  It's war.
[01:43:22.782 --> 01:43:23.022]  It's war.
[01:43:23.042 --> 01:43:24.383]  Or Russia or something like that.
[01:43:24.663 --> 01:43:27.084]  He did it on our own people, on our own country.
[01:43:27.104 --> 01:43:28.224]  That's what I said yesterday.
[01:43:28.244 --> 01:43:29.785]  So this is a sanction against America.
[01:43:30.598 --> 01:43:31.358]  Yeah.
[01:43:31.458 --> 01:43:35.520]  And I can't remember a time when this has been done to this extreme, right?
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:36.700]  Because what's that going to do?
[01:43:37.121 --> 01:43:38.401]  It's going to hamper jobs.
[01:43:38.481 --> 01:43:39.742]  It's going to hamper job growth.
[01:43:40.522 --> 01:43:46.384]  And now you're going to have so much unemployment that their government tax revenues are going to come down.
[01:43:46.424 --> 01:43:47.125]  Remember what he did.
[01:43:47.165 --> 01:43:50.966]  A year ago, he lived in Texas on Venezuela to get their oil.
[01:43:51.166 --> 01:43:52.687]  Why doesn't he want us to produce it?
[01:43:55.528 --> 01:43:57.150]  I think this is all political.
[01:43:57.770 --> 01:44:01.673]  This is economic ramifications of political consequences.
[01:44:02.073 --> 01:44:04.315]  And they're not even thinking second, third, fourth order.
[01:44:04.335 --> 01:44:04.936]  They're just doing it.
[01:44:05.856 --> 01:44:06.917]  They're just doing it.
[01:44:06.977 --> 01:44:09.880]  They're not looking at the consequences of their action.
[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:13.983]  The unintended consequences of what's going to happen is job losses.
[01:44:14.243 --> 01:44:17.205]  People now go into the government for unemployment insurance.
[01:44:17.526 --> 01:44:19.127]  You look at the tech stock.
[01:44:19.167 --> 01:44:21.689]  Our number one export, the only thing we have left is energy.
[01:44:22.951 --> 01:44:24.172]  And they're cutting that off.
[01:44:24.212 --> 01:44:26.514]  That is so criminal.
[01:44:26.574 --> 01:44:28.096]  I mean, it's so hard to believe they did it.
[01:44:29.477 --> 01:44:37.979]  It's counterintuitive, and it makes no sense, other than they hate, they hate petroleum-based products.
[01:44:38.019 --> 01:44:50.643]  They want this green world, and so now is their time, and with Texas going on, everything going on in Texas, they now figure this is their chance to strike, and they're going to basically say this is because of climate change and all that kind of garbage.
[01:44:50.663 --> 01:44:55.264]  And now Texas is going to sit on top of all this gas for the world that they load on those ships.
[01:44:56.164 --> 01:44:56.964]  It's incredible.
[01:44:57.244 --> 01:45:01.945]  It's so, for people that don't know, folks, it's like cutting your paycheck off.
[01:45:01.985 --> 01:45:03.486]  I mean, that's what we have is energy.
[01:45:04.586 --> 01:45:04.746]  Yeah.
[01:45:05.126 --> 01:45:11.368]  How is Putin, whether you love Putin or hate him, Putin, Russia's more powerful now than ever because they're selling oil and gas to everybody.
[01:45:11.908 --> 01:45:12.988]  That's why they blow up the pipeline.
[01:45:13.288 --> 01:45:17.109]  So Biden's not just blowing up Russian pipelines, he's cutting our pipelines off.
[01:45:19.615 --> 01:45:22.716]  He's basically slitting our own throat.
[01:45:23.356 --> 01:45:37.901]  I mean, there's not much better in America that we're good at other than oil and gas, and he's taking the most productive thing that we have, and this is going to impact people in Texas and Louisiana and Pennsylvania and North Dakota, Arizona, Colorado, right?
[01:45:37.941 --> 01:45:42.962]  I mean, we do a lot of natural gas really well in this country.
[01:45:42.982 --> 01:45:47.544]  Oh, if you go down to Houston, there's 50 ships loading liquid natural gas right now.
[01:45:47.564 --> 01:45:48.864]  Now they're just like, sorry, can't sell.
[01:45:50.316 --> 01:45:51.219]  Well, they're just going to sit there.
[01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:52.243]  What are they going to do?
[01:45:52.263 --> 01:45:52.564]  Wow!
[01:45:52.765 --> 01:45:55.535]  And those are paychecks to all those people that have gas bills on their property.
[01:45:56.269 --> 01:45:58.070]  And all the engineers that drill the wells.
[01:45:59.490 --> 01:46:00.290]  Gosh.
[01:46:00.971 --> 01:46:03.211]  Consider the implications of this, Alex.
[01:46:03.671 --> 01:46:05.652]  Income tax revenues are going to come down.
[01:46:06.112 --> 01:46:07.853]  Sales tax revenues are going to come down.
[01:46:07.913 --> 01:46:10.214]  As people lose their jobs, they're not going to spend money.
[01:46:10.234 --> 01:46:14.115]  We're the biggest natural gas exporter in the world.
[01:46:14.155 --> 01:46:14.915]  He's cutting it off.
[01:46:14.975 --> 01:46:16.355]  I mean, it's sensational.
[01:46:17.356 --> 01:46:19.977]  But the average person is like, oh, a little factoid.
[01:46:20.337 --> 01:46:21.477]  Why do I care about natural gas?
[01:46:21.697 --> 01:46:23.838]  Because it freaking runs the economy, people.
[01:46:25.506 --> 01:46:27.768]  Yeah, so ramifications of this.
[01:46:28.308 --> 01:46:29.709]  Inflation is coming.
[01:46:29.909 --> 01:46:33.051]  Tax revenues are going to come down, income streams for the government.
[01:46:33.372 --> 01:46:41.317]  They're going to be forced to print money, which is why I believe that Jerome Powell at the Fed did not lower interest rates.
[01:46:41.858 --> 01:46:42.998]  He kept them steady.
[01:46:43.078 --> 01:46:46.201]  He just paused on it, promising that they're going to lower them.
[01:46:46.501 --> 01:46:49.103]  That promise is a lie, just like everything else that they do.
[01:46:49.363 --> 01:46:50.544]  Now, they might do it once.
[01:46:51.084 --> 01:47:02.329]  So they can say that, yeah, we told you we're going to lower rates, but I think as inflation persists, the only policy outcome is to stop printing money, which they're not going to do, or raise interest rates to slow down that inflation.
[01:47:02.789 --> 01:47:03.710]  That's what's coming.
[01:47:04.150 --> 01:47:08.392]  That's what's going to impact Americans living at the margin more than anything.
[01:47:08.472 --> 01:47:11.033]  And if you wanted to help people, you'd have a cheap energy policy.
[01:47:11.433 --> 01:47:11.774]  But that's...
[01:47:14.924 --> 01:47:15.184]  Yes.
[01:47:16.125 --> 01:47:18.067]  So this is the world that we're living in.
[01:47:18.087 --> 01:47:20.008]  By the way, you come on, though.
[01:47:20.048 --> 01:47:20.569]  Talk about it.
[01:47:20.589 --> 01:47:24.012]  We'll do a deep dive tomorrow, noon tomorrow, Saturday, tomorrow.
[01:47:24.032 --> 01:47:25.053]  Just 24 hours away.
[01:47:25.073 --> 01:47:26.694]  But you never plug your company.
[01:47:26.714 --> 01:47:27.755]  We're getting great reviews.
[01:47:27.775 --> 01:47:29.136]  You already have five stars online.
[01:47:29.596 --> 01:47:34.541]  You've got gold and silver bullion ready to ship right now.
[01:47:34.581 --> 01:47:38.023]  You don't even get in the games, the numismatic, all that.
[01:47:38.104 --> 01:47:38.924]  You're a great sponsor.
[01:47:38.964 --> 01:47:40.385]  People should get gold and silver from you.
[01:47:40.686 --> 01:47:41.466]  You're ready to ship it.
[01:47:41.486 --> 01:47:41.947]  How do they do it?
[01:47:43.151 --> 01:47:54.255]  Yeah, just go to kepm.com forward slash gold, and there's a little form that they can fill out and say, hey, I want to talk to Kirk or his team and get this all squared away, right?
[01:47:54.295 --> 01:48:04.679]  We want to listen to you, hear your dreams, hear your fears, hear what concerns you, and map out a strategy for success moving forward using tangible assets to protect, preserve, grow, and thrive.
[01:48:05.119 --> 01:48:08.261]  Or you can call 720-605-3900 and just say, Alex sent you, right?
[01:48:08.301 --> 01:48:08.561]  Because...
[01:48:12.042 --> 01:48:12.222]  I think?
[01:48:28.806 --> 01:48:29.267]  We're good to go.
[01:48:46.286 --> 01:48:53.669]  Well, the time is, grow a garden, get gold, get silver, learn how to shoot a gun, because this son of a bitch is going down.
[01:48:54.069 --> 01:48:56.310]  And I look at the craziness of the left.
[01:48:56.890 --> 01:49:00.852]  In Europe, the farmers are tearing up the roads, burning stuff down because they've outlawed them.
[01:49:01.052 --> 01:49:02.172]  They're saying you're shut down.
[01:49:02.493 --> 01:49:03.793]  They're cutting the food off.
[01:49:04.153 --> 01:49:09.055]  They believe we'll be so dumb, Klaus Schwab said, when everybody gets angry, they'll accept the new communist model.
[01:49:09.175 --> 01:49:10.576]  No, no, we're not.
[01:49:10.816 --> 01:49:13.477]  We know they're doing it, but they're still going ahead with it.
[01:49:16.011 --> 01:49:19.015]  These globalist policies, Alex, are insane.
[01:49:19.035 --> 01:49:22.418]  It has nothing to do with fixing the system.
[01:49:22.459 --> 01:49:24.521]  It has everything to do with people control.
[01:49:24.881 --> 01:49:32.209]  When you can stop what people are earning, what they spend their money on based on your ideology, what you eat, where you travel, what kind of health you have,
[01:49:32.890 --> 01:49:38.811]  Which is why the supplements that you have are so important, because they're pushing vaccines down our throat.
[01:49:38.891 --> 01:49:43.252]  I mean, this is all about people control, which your listeners know that.
[01:49:43.272 --> 01:49:44.653]  You talk about this all the time.
[01:49:44.993 --> 01:49:50.434]  But all of those policies have severe economic ramifications, which is the one that I... Well, let me ask you this.
[01:49:50.454 --> 01:49:53.255]  I'm going to give you the floor here, because you're going to fly out tonight from Denver.
[01:49:53.275 --> 01:49:53.915]  You'll be here tomorrow.
[01:49:53.935 --> 01:49:56.235]  We're going to do a two-hour at least live show.
[01:49:56.275 --> 01:49:58.736]  Then I've got Gavin McGinnis here for an interview we're doing and a bunch of stuff.
[01:49:59.096 --> 01:49:59.657]  We're good to go.
[01:50:17.403 --> 01:50:24.527]  Well, I expect chaos, mayhem, economic fallout from all of these policies.
[01:50:24.988 --> 01:50:34.454]  But see, during times of economic fallout, when people can't feed their kids, when they can't afford to pay their rent or their mortgage, when food prices are going through the roof, gas prices are going through the roof.
[01:50:35.054 --> 01:50:37.275]  Here's the nature, human nature.
[01:50:37.795 --> 01:50:44.478]  People tend to give up their freedoms in time of crisis in exchange for perceived security or peace.
[01:50:45.838 --> 01:50:52.741]  So I expect that, because look, the people in charge right now can't win on their own merits.
[01:50:52.781 --> 01:50:54.481]  They've destroyed the economy.
[01:50:54.521 --> 01:50:56.262]  They've destroyed society in America.
[01:50:56.362 --> 01:51:00.664]  But if you destroy it bad enough, you might get votes.
[01:51:00.704 --> 01:51:02.464]  Because people will want you to try to fix it.
[01:51:02.504 --> 01:51:03.845]  They're going to try to trick us
[01:51:04.465 --> 01:51:05.125]  We're good to go.
[01:51:29.011 --> 01:51:29.852]  You know, I'm not God.
[01:51:29.872 --> 01:51:31.294]  I don't control the markets.
[01:51:31.815 --> 01:51:46.614]  My expectation is this does play itself out before the election this year because you have to have some kind of a crisis to get momentum to get people to try to vote for you because you come up with a proposed solution.
[01:51:52.887 --> 01:51:55.988]  Okay, so with that, what do we do?
[01:51:56.008 --> 01:52:02.830]  I mean, if you have a bank account that's... I've got this.
[01:52:03.250 --> 01:52:04.290]  So I just read this article.
[01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:05.411]  We're going to talk about this tomorrow.
[01:52:05.751 --> 01:52:08.672]  Regional banks are starting to crash again.
[01:52:08.692 --> 01:52:11.473]  I think we're going to have regional bank failures 2.0.
[01:52:12.853 --> 01:52:14.113]  Banks are undercapitalized.
[01:52:14.153 --> 01:52:19.395]  I mean, listen to this list of bank stocks that just got shellacked yesterday alone.
[01:52:19.875 --> 01:52:23.479]  So regional banks like, here, let me read this.
[01:52:23.839 --> 01:52:34.830]  Western Alliance Bank Corp., Zions Bank, Comerica, Webster Financial, Citizens Financial, Regions, South State, Prosperity Bank, Schwab, of all things.
[01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:41.036]  PacWest, Huntington Bank shares, all their stocks are just being trashed, just going to the pit.
[01:52:41.376 --> 01:52:44.399]  That's the first sign of bank failures coming.
[01:52:44.900 --> 01:52:53.528]  Look what happened to the markets when Silicon Valley, Signature Bank, Silvergate, Credit Suisse, and Western, I mean, we're in grief.
[01:52:54.109 --> 01:52:56.731]  I mean, I think what we're going to see are bank failures.
[01:52:57.092 --> 01:52:58.733]  What's going to impact people's
[01:52:59.494 --> 01:53:01.937]  Fear of the markets more than anything.
[01:53:02.417 --> 01:53:07.202]  They're banks running out of money, which is supposed to be the safest asset that they have.
[01:53:07.703 --> 01:53:11.326]  So I think you're going to see a lot of upheaval and people starting to operate out of fear.
[01:53:11.366 --> 01:53:17.633]  How is that going to go for the New World Order, though, when they want to create the crisis and pose the savior?
[01:53:18.053 --> 01:53:20.596]  If they are exposed as the bad guys, how does that go for them?
[01:53:21.786 --> 01:53:24.988]  Well, they're pretending that they're not the bad guys, Alex.
[01:53:25.028 --> 01:53:27.149]  So what are they going to do when banks fail?
[01:53:27.169 --> 01:53:35.814]  They'll say, we've got a new solution to bring in to actually replace all these failing banks based on fiat-based money creation.
[01:53:35.854 --> 01:53:38.876]  We've got digital money creation, 365 days a year, 24-7 instant money transfer.
[01:53:41.778 --> 01:53:43.359]  We can find the money launderers.
[01:53:43.399 --> 01:53:46.920]  We can find the drug traffickers, the human traffickers, all of this stuff.
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:49.581]  And people are going to buy into that baloney.
[01:53:49.661 --> 01:53:52.362]  I mean, I would love for all of that stuff to go away.
[01:53:52.522 --> 01:53:53.182]  All of us would.
[01:53:53.522 --> 01:53:56.784]  But the flip side of that coin is they can also monitor you.
[01:53:57.124 --> 01:54:01.205]  What church you give to, what church you donate to, what political party, right?
[01:54:01.565 --> 01:54:02.786]  How you spend your money.
[01:54:02.826 --> 01:54:06.968]  Do you spend money on gas or on meat or whatever, right?
[01:54:07.088 --> 01:54:08.048]  Everything that they don't want.
[01:54:08.388 --> 01:54:08.868]  We're good to go.
[01:54:35.026 --> 01:54:36.447]  And don't take my word for it.
[01:54:36.827 --> 01:54:50.659]  Listen to the words and the policies of the World Economic Forum, the Bank for International Settlements, the International Monetary Fund, the Fed, the European Central Bank, all of them in concert saying central bank digital currency is coming.
[01:54:50.999 --> 01:54:52.221]  And you know what they're afraid of?
[01:54:52.761 --> 01:54:53.702]  They're afraid of Trump.
[01:54:54.563 --> 01:54:56.945]  You know, Christine Lagarde at the European Union.
[01:54:57.145 --> 01:54:59.727]  Because he doesn't want to loot the American people.
[01:54:59.767 --> 01:55:00.228]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:55:01.038 --> 01:55:07.860]  Yeah, they don't want Trump in because he's going to expose the globalist plan and they think that it's going to be lights out, right?
[01:55:08.341 --> 01:55:12.502]  So what they want is elimination of paper currency.
[01:55:12.542 --> 01:55:13.982]  They want the elimination of their own system.
[01:55:14.002 --> 01:55:14.723]  They want that digital control.
[01:55:14.763 --> 01:55:19.985]  Kirk Elliott, literally, I knew who you were years ago and I was looking for a good gold sponsor.
[01:55:20.005 --> 01:55:20.845]  You never plug yourself.
[01:55:21.565 --> 01:55:23.207]  And then I'm like, hey, reach out.
[01:55:23.227 --> 01:55:24.228]  Yeah, I want to be a sponsor.
[01:55:24.248 --> 01:55:24.489]  Great.
[01:55:24.749 --> 01:55:25.650]  And the listeners love you.
[01:55:25.670 --> 01:55:26.431]  You're so smart.
[01:55:26.752 --> 01:55:27.533]  You're so dead on.
[01:55:27.553 --> 01:55:29.915]  But people do need to get basic gold and silver.
[01:55:30.216 --> 01:55:32.979]  They need to at least stick their toe in the ocean and do it.
[01:55:33.019 --> 01:55:35.322]  They need to go to your website, kepm.com.
[01:55:40.328 --> 01:55:42.370]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:55:42.410 --> 01:55:47.835]  That's KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:55:47.855 --> 01:55:49.116]  Or call 720-605-3900.
[01:55:49.136 --> 01:55:53.360]  And I need to talk to you folks and start getting gold and silver bullion now.
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:54.561]  But regardless...
[01:55:55.618 --> 01:55:56.599]  I think you're saying.
[01:56:22.657 --> 01:56:37.549]  They do need to get ready because some of the stuff we're going to be talking about tomorrow, state pensions are facing insolvency, people's retirements facing insolvency, not all gold and silver created equal, right?
[01:56:37.589 --> 01:56:39.431]  You're hearing ads everywhere saying,
[01:56:39.571 --> 01:56:40.752]  Don't go into rare stuff.
[01:56:40.772 --> 01:56:43.653]  Don't go into those coins that you're never going to recover from those premiums.
[01:56:43.693 --> 01:56:44.394]  I've been doing this for decades.
[01:56:44.414 --> 01:56:49.057]  Well, that's why when I was looking for somebody that has good ratings and just sells bullion, that's the sure bet.
[01:56:49.457 --> 01:56:51.718]  And you give them a little charge to pay for it and run your operation.
[01:56:52.419 --> 01:56:52.999]  I love you, man.
[01:56:53.059 --> 01:56:58.382]  I'm telling you, people, if you want gold and silver, go to kepm.com forward slash gold.
[01:56:58.722 --> 01:57:02.044]  They keep us on air and they're straight up and they've got it and they're ready to ship it.
[01:57:03.745 --> 01:57:04.566]  Well, thanks for that.
[01:57:04.666 --> 01:57:06.567]  I mean, we love doing what we do.
[01:57:06.667 --> 01:57:07.948]  We love helping people.
[01:57:09.143 --> 01:57:11.564]  The philosophy of our firm is people over profit.
[01:57:11.624 --> 01:57:14.686]  I wish that were the case for every firm in the industry, right?
[01:57:14.726 --> 01:57:17.567]  But most companies are profit over people.
[01:57:17.667 --> 01:57:18.748]  They make as much as you can.
[01:57:18.768 --> 01:57:22.930]  Oh, I've had them as sponsors, and I drop them because I go, I want you to only sell them bullion.
[01:57:23.010 --> 01:57:24.871]  And day one, they sell them some numismatic.
[01:57:25.411 --> 01:57:26.131]  And I'm just like, done.
[01:57:26.151 --> 01:57:26.792]  Yeah, when you focus on...
[01:57:27.392 --> 01:57:30.115]  Yeah, when you focus on people, Alex, profit will come.
[01:57:30.155 --> 01:57:32.597]  If you ever start focusing on profit, people will leave.
[01:57:32.717 --> 01:57:34.960]  Well, it's like Tony Montana at the end of Scarface.
[01:57:34.980 --> 01:57:36.221]  Don't want to blow the kids up in the car.
[01:57:36.241 --> 01:57:38.303]  He goes, hey, man, I don't need that in my life.
[01:57:38.723 --> 01:57:39.764]  I need a straight shoot.
[01:57:39.965 --> 01:57:40.906]  I need the good mojo.
[01:57:41.186 --> 01:57:42.547]  Kirk Elliott, see you tomorrow.
[01:57:42.567 --> 01:57:43.048]  Love you, brother.
[01:57:43.869 --> 01:57:44.029]  See you.
[01:57:44.069 --> 01:57:44.509]  Love you, too.
[01:57:44.529 --> 01:57:44.589]  Bye.
[01:57:44.950 --> 01:57:45.450]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:45.470 --> 01:57:45.791]  Stay with us.
[01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:51.820]  Gunther in Tennessee.
[01:57:51.860 --> 01:57:52.901]  Thanks for calling, Gunther.
[01:57:53.061 --> 01:57:53.401]  Hey, Alex.
[01:57:53.581 --> 01:57:54.361]  First time caller.
[01:57:54.441 --> 01:57:56.281]  Real quick, wanted to plug your foundational energy.
[01:57:56.822 --> 01:57:57.782]  Just started taking that.
[01:57:58.442 --> 01:58:02.763]  And boy, three pills, the recommended dose, I was bouncing off the walls.
[01:58:02.883 --> 01:58:08.505]  But I tell you, foundational is the right name for that product because I'll cut down to one.
[01:58:09.125 --> 01:58:13.386]  It's like you have a baseline of energy that you were missing before that you got back.
[01:58:13.486 --> 01:58:13.586]  So,
[01:58:13.746 --> 01:58:22.030]  Well, I'm glad you mentioned that because it's methylfolate, the breakdown of folic acid, and a lot of people, particularly Europeans, don't absorb all of the folic acid.
[01:58:22.270 --> 01:58:23.371]  So it's not a stimulant.
[01:58:23.591 --> 01:58:26.992]  It's a totally natural thing that boosts energy that's foundational.
[01:58:27.292 --> 01:58:29.854]  And was I lying to you or did it not work?
[01:58:30.534 --> 01:58:31.714]  No, it was top-notch.
[01:58:31.774 --> 01:58:35.396]  And I was actually taking Red Pill Plus before, and that's got a little folic acid in it.
[01:58:35.456 --> 01:58:39.238]  I think there was a little buildup from this, but the energy from this was no jitters.
[01:58:39.438 --> 01:58:40.358]  I mean, it's top-notch.
[01:58:40.378 --> 01:58:41.159]  It's a great product.
[01:58:41.584 --> 01:58:42.527]  Well, thank you so much.
[01:58:42.587 --> 01:58:46.337]  Yeah, no, folic acid's great and it's in real red pill, but some can't break it down.
[01:58:46.377 --> 01:58:47.379]  This is the breakdown of it.
[01:58:47.459 --> 01:58:48.141]  That's exactly it.
[01:58:49.156 --> 01:58:59.665]  Naturally sourced from the finest hemp plants in America, RebelZen offers the absolute finest quality CBD available and at the lowest prices.
[01:59:00.725 --> 01:59:15.317]  Extracted using a cold pressed technique to retain the molecular integrity of the cannabinoids and terpenes within the plant, this full spectrum formula ensures that your nervous system gets the full benefits of CBD.
[01:59:16.518 --> 01:59:26.442]  Premium quality organic CBD, like Rebel Zen, has been shown to naturally reduce anxiety, relieve pain, and decrease inflammation.
[01:59:26.922 --> 01:59:34.524]  People have reported a reduction in symptoms of insomnia, arthritis, seizures, chronic pain, and epilepsy.
[01:59:35.025 --> 01:59:41.647]  Several studies have shown it helps to reduce cortisol, increase serotonin, and boost vitality.

[01:59:52.537 --> 01:59:56.461]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:00.834 --> 02:00:05.917]  I both talked to Tucker Carlson and Russell Brand privately about the nature of Satan.
[02:00:07.238 --> 02:00:11.220]  Once you admit Satan's real, and that God's real, you have power over the enemy.
[02:00:11.740 --> 02:00:18.725]  Here's a short clip from Tucker Carlson's latest interview, and then we'll go to break, come back with breaking news, and then Ivan Ranklin's in studio.
[02:00:18.745 --> 02:00:19.145]  Stay with us.
[02:00:20.669 --> 02:00:23.412]  So the things that the people in charge hate include nature.
[02:00:23.432 --> 02:00:24.093]  Yes.
[02:00:24.633 --> 02:00:28.577]  And the class of people who are most useful to your nation.
[02:00:28.617 --> 02:00:29.318]  You described them.
[02:00:29.918 --> 02:00:32.461]  Cops, firemen, teachers, nurses.
[02:00:32.641 --> 02:00:34.263]  All of them are crushing COVID, by the way.
[02:00:34.523 --> 02:00:35.084]  Yes.
[02:00:35.304 --> 02:00:35.744]  And farmers.
[02:00:36.605 --> 02:00:39.708]  And it's indisputable that if you don't have those people, you don't have a society.
[02:00:40.229 --> 02:00:44.934]  You could get rid of every think tank and every sociology department and every liberal arts university and you'd probably be okay.
[02:00:45.234 --> 02:00:46.555]  You get rid of your farmers, you starve to death.
[02:00:47.116 --> 02:00:55.244]  So it's not obvious why the leadership of a country would hate the very people they need most and hate the most beautiful and valuable thing they have, which is nature.
[02:00:55.705 --> 02:00:56.666]  Why do they hate those things?
[02:00:59.361 --> 02:01:28.464]  It terrifies me to contemplate, Tucker, that people like Alex Jones and in our country, David Icke, who, aside from some views that are impossible to corroborate around quite occultist and shall we call them marginal ideas, difficult to corroborate ideas, when it comes to the subject of globalisation and the increasing authoritarianisation of our planet, appear to have been ahead of the curve.
[02:01:29.304 --> 02:01:36.148]  You can see them 20, 30 years ago saying the empowerment of NATO, the empowerment of World Banks and the WHO.
[02:01:36.268 --> 02:01:37.949]  It's extraordinary.
[02:01:38.812 --> 02:01:59.429]  And it seems to me that the disempowerment of ordinary people, the condemnation, the demoralisation of the public, to create people that just are weary and broken, and if not enslaved, then so dependent it amounts to a form of slavery, cannot be inadvertent.
[02:02:00.110 --> 02:02:05.855]  It seems to be a denial of something fundamental that I, in my language, I would call spirit.
[02:02:06.335 --> 02:02:06.515]  Yeah.
[02:02:22.595 --> 02:02:47.277]  It seems to me that, yes, that if you start to attack those pivotal infrastructural roles, I was struck when speaking to some of the people that you work with, man, you know, there's been a cop for 26 years in New Jersey, 35 years in the security services, but these people that give their lives for a country, so to tell those people that your country doesn't mean anything or to alter the meaning of what a nation is or alter what your contribution has been,
[02:02:47.697 --> 02:02:50.180]  It seems to be about a kind of disorientation.
[02:02:50.300 --> 02:02:51.582]  And it's difficult, actually, sometimes.
[02:02:51.602 --> 02:02:59.932]  The reason I mentioned at the beginning of this rather corroming answer figures that are broadly condemned as conspiracy theorists, but then aren't we all these days?
[02:03:00.773 --> 02:03:04.077]  The reason I mention them is because they talk specifically about ideas...
[02:03:04.437 --> 02:03:08.661]  It's difficult to think that there isn't something dark at its core.
[02:03:29.318 --> 02:03:31.499]  Because there's no rational explanation for that.
[02:03:45.408 --> 02:03:47.629]  What we're watching are the fruits of spiritual war.
[02:03:47.849 --> 02:03:49.890]  If you're going to give a better explanation, let me know.
[02:03:50.030 --> 02:03:52.351]  Certainly the solution seems to me to be spiritual.
[02:03:52.391 --> 02:04:00.033]  And even when they're talking about ecology and evoking words like Gaia, like the spirit of the planet, it seems oddly utilitarian.
[02:04:00.373 --> 02:04:01.794]  The Earth is a resource.
[02:04:02.014 --> 02:04:12.398]  Even when claiming to care about the types of energy industry that might be most beneficial and those which might not be as beneficial, I don't see reverence.
[02:04:12.918 --> 02:04:13.398]  We're good to go.
[02:04:28.087 --> 02:04:34.471]  Who among us ought not love our planet and behave respectfully and reverentially and lovingly to our planet?
[02:04:34.692 --> 02:04:37.073]  And how is that going to happen if no one has a relationship with it?
[02:04:37.093 --> 02:04:42.337]  I think like 90% of, in my country, 90% of the land is inaccessible to most people.
[02:04:42.357 --> 02:04:44.458]  90% of the land is privately owned.
[02:04:44.778 --> 02:04:48.281]  Land that used to be commonly held is now all privately owned.
[02:04:48.501 --> 02:04:55.846]  There has been successive law after successive law that has moved power and control and the land and nature herself into the hands of an elite.
[02:04:57.947 --> 02:04:58.407]  We're good to go.
[02:05:17.498 --> 02:05:19.240]  Folks, there's a giant list of things it does.
[02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:21.222]  Go to Infowarsstore.com and read about it.

[02:06:00.172 --> 02:06:09.601]  When I was a child, they told me the new war was coming.
[02:06:09.641 --> 02:06:13.084]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:06:13.365 --> 02:06:14.405]  They told me to be there.
[02:06:14.526 --> 02:06:18.689]  Alex Jones told me to get the people ready.
[02:06:20.651 --> 02:06:24.555]  And I did.
[02:06:24.655 --> 02:06:25.616]  And now... In the year 2054...
[02:06:26.997 --> 02:06:28.717]  We face the globalist onslaught.
[02:06:29.438 --> 02:06:31.498]  We're not hypothetical anymore.
[02:06:31.898 --> 02:06:33.719]  We're not in the enemy's beta test.
[02:06:34.399 --> 02:06:37.760]  We are in the fulcrum.
[02:06:37.780 --> 02:06:38.520]  We are in the battle.
[02:06:39.560 --> 02:06:41.761]  We are fighting for our lives.
[02:06:44.181 --> 02:06:49.743]  And I know that if you'll simply admit that to yourself, we will win.
[02:06:50.823 --> 02:06:52.744]  You are so smart.
[02:06:53.784 --> 02:06:54.424]  So powerful.
[02:06:55.899 --> 02:07:04.061]  Waiting for you to join us.
[02:07:12.303 --> 02:07:18.245]  All right, so that said, I've got all these articles about Pito Pesta.
[02:07:20.526 --> 02:07:22.986]  Because their whole program, their ESGs are falling apart.
[02:07:23.446 --> 02:07:24.927]  Their whole new order is going down.
[02:07:26.363 --> 02:07:27.864]  We are wrecking the living hell out of them.
[02:07:28.264 --> 02:07:29.724]  But the enemy's going to hit back.
[02:07:29.824 --> 02:07:33.846]  So just because we're having some victories, let's not start celebrating yet.
[02:07:34.726 --> 02:07:39.008]  John Pito Esca to replace Kerry as top climate diplomat.
[02:07:39.328 --> 02:07:45.390]  So Kerry's running around trying to cut our gas-powered stoves off and our cars off and start the living hell out of us.
[02:07:46.351 --> 02:07:47.211]  And now they're going to put this...
[02:07:48.786 --> 02:07:49.986]  Man, read the WikiLeaks, man.
[02:07:50.507 --> 02:07:54.488]  We're going to have kids ready for you in upstate New York in a hot tub.
[02:07:54.548 --> 02:07:55.649]  They're 7, 9, and 10.
[02:07:55.869 --> 02:07:57.149]  They're going to service you, sir.
[02:07:57.169 --> 02:07:59.710]  I mean, that's screwing kids, folks.
[02:08:00.370 --> 02:08:01.811]  That son of a bitch screws kids.
[02:08:02.971 --> 02:08:03.952]  He's caught red-handed.
[02:08:05.984 --> 02:08:09.409]  Julian Assange is in solitary confinement being tortured to death to bring us this information.
[02:08:09.689 --> 02:08:14.115]  It's like in Star Wars when she says, many Bothans have died to bring us this information.
[02:08:14.416 --> 02:08:15.217]  That's a movie.
[02:08:15.698 --> 02:08:16.719]  This is a real world.
[02:08:17.140 --> 02:08:21.606]  Many people have been put in prison and killed to bring us this information.
[02:08:21.846 --> 02:08:32.734]  And we just sit there kind of like, oh, the NSA talked to our people last night and said they're turning on the NSA spy grid and they're about to have white supremacist attack the Border Patrol.
[02:08:33.095 --> 02:08:34.636]  Oh, that's just Alex over there.
[02:08:34.656 --> 02:08:36.777]  You know, he's just saying that stuff.
[02:08:37.198 --> 02:08:38.078]  I didn't say that.
[02:08:38.158 --> 02:08:38.679]  It's true.
[02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:43.903]  You're being given the keys to their destruction.
[02:08:44.423 --> 02:08:45.044]  That's what we do.
[02:08:46.892 --> 02:08:48.713]  Because we're willing to do it, folks.
[02:08:49.153 --> 02:08:50.574]  And people go, why are you so alive?
[02:08:50.874 --> 02:08:52.895]  Because the devil ain't in charge, folks.
[02:08:53.335 --> 02:08:56.216]  We give him all the power he's got.
[02:08:58.117 --> 02:08:59.497]  How about we stop giving him the power?
[02:09:01.418 --> 02:09:08.201]  The New World Order pulled me over today and stood me up against the wall and said, reject Jesus Christ or I'm going to shoot you in the back of the head.
[02:09:08.521 --> 02:09:10.822]  I'd say, thank God I'm about to get the hell out of this.
[02:09:11.202 --> 02:09:12.183]  And I'm not suicidal.
[02:09:12.223 --> 02:09:12.763]  I'm just saying...
[02:09:14.457 --> 02:09:15.158]  We're good to go.
[02:09:42.542 --> 02:09:49.592]  That's the ecstasy of it, is they've hurt me so bad, there's not much more they can do.
[02:09:54.959 --> 02:09:58.023]  The last thing I'm going to do is get my hands around their neck.
[02:10:03.882 --> 02:10:05.263]  Because my full will is against them.
[02:10:05.303 --> 02:10:07.144]  They can feel it like a knife in their guts.
[02:10:07.785 --> 02:10:12.968]  My will is like a double-edged, foot-long dagger shoved right up their ass.
[02:10:13.589 --> 02:10:17.352]  And they can feel it, and they know it, and I'm going to get them.
[02:10:21.454 --> 02:10:25.197]  I'm going to get your ass if it's the last thing I do.
[02:10:26.998 --> 02:10:31.682]  You know, Captain Ahab got his leg cut off and broken up in that fictional book.
[02:10:32.509 --> 02:10:34.370]  And he hated that white whale and went after it.
[02:10:34.770 --> 02:10:37.671]  Well, all that white whale did was take your leg off, man.
[02:10:38.011 --> 02:10:38.471]  I get it.
[02:10:38.531 --> 02:10:39.072]  You're pissed.
[02:10:40.112 --> 02:10:41.453]  But you took a lot more of my leg.
[02:10:42.693 --> 02:10:43.573]  You took a lot more.
[02:10:45.534 --> 02:10:47.535]  And I know you're going down.
[02:10:47.975 --> 02:10:49.236]  I can smell your death.
[02:10:49.816 --> 02:10:51.077]  I can feel it right now.
[02:10:52.157 --> 02:10:54.098]  And sure, I'd love to be around at the end of this.
[02:10:55.216 --> 02:10:56.196]  We're good to go.
[02:11:27.065 --> 02:11:29.426]  And we will never submit to them.
[02:11:29.766 --> 02:11:31.607]  We will never bow.
[02:11:35.228 --> 02:11:36.549]  I got hundreds of articles right here.
[02:11:37.089 --> 02:11:37.409]  Hundreds.
[02:11:37.890 --> 02:11:39.630]  I got clips that are so horrible.
[02:11:41.651 --> 02:11:45.213]  My only failure is I watch this stuff and I don't even want to put it on air.
[02:11:48.474 --> 02:11:49.154]  But you know what?
[02:11:50.275 --> 02:11:50.915]  It is what it is.
[02:11:52.115 --> 02:11:53.296]  Just look at this headline right here.
[02:11:58.993 --> 02:12:00.014]  Look at this headline around here.
[02:12:01.695 --> 02:12:02.636]  Because it says it all.
[02:12:06.639 --> 02:12:07.240]  Look at this meme.
[02:12:10.042 --> 02:12:11.343]  If you're ready to listen, I'll describe it.
[02:12:11.523 --> 02:12:12.524]  It's a little sweet girl.
[02:12:13.164 --> 02:12:14.185]  Probably a four-year-old girl.
[02:12:15.266 --> 02:12:16.507]  You'd die for her, wouldn't you?
[02:12:16.527 --> 02:12:17.908]  There's no question you would.
[02:12:18.169 --> 02:12:19.349]  Because you got God on your side.
[02:12:19.610 --> 02:12:22.132]  If you don't look at her and are ready to die for her, you're dead already.
[02:12:23.133 --> 02:12:23.773]  Drive a car?
[02:12:24.253 --> 02:12:24.514]  No.
[02:12:25.374 --> 02:12:26.295]  She can't drive a car.
[02:12:26.315 --> 02:12:26.896]  She doesn't know how.
[02:12:26.916 --> 02:12:28.517]  We're going to protect her.
[02:12:30.011 --> 02:12:31.974]  Pick your bedtime, little four-year-old boy.
[02:12:32.315 --> 02:12:32.535]  No.
[02:12:33.837 --> 02:12:36.160]  Drink a beer for a little six-year-old girl.
[02:12:36.441 --> 02:12:36.681]  No.
[02:12:38.244 --> 02:12:38.504]  Vote?
[02:12:38.804 --> 02:12:39.085]  No.
[02:12:39.966 --> 02:12:43.011]  Cut off your sexual organs and take hormones?
[02:12:43.031 --> 02:12:43.091]  Yes.
[02:12:45.385 --> 02:12:47.306]  Look how far we've slid.
[02:12:47.947 --> 02:12:49.328]  Look what we've become.
[02:12:49.368 --> 02:13:02.016]  And God's literally looking down on us, watching us, giving us the energy and the program to stop this and saying, I want you on my side, but if you don't resist this, I'm going to cut you off.
[02:13:03.497 --> 02:13:03.997]  It's that simple.
[02:13:06.339 --> 02:13:13.883]  Can't drive a car, can't pick your own bedtime, can't drink a beer, can't vote, but you can sure as hell
[02:13:14.949 --> 02:13:15.950]  Cut your penis off!
[02:13:37.705 --> 02:13:38.925]  I was like, well, that's the zeitgeist.
[02:13:39.266 --> 02:13:39.866]  I never got to it.
[02:13:40.206 --> 02:13:41.286]  It's this mother.
[02:13:41.666 --> 02:13:42.107]  Look at her.
[02:13:42.427 --> 02:13:52.050]  It's this trendy mother with her 10-year-old daughter, and she cries and begs and doesn't want it, and they inject her with pellets that are going to sterilize her for life and ruin her power.
[02:13:53.551 --> 02:13:56.372]  And this person does it because she wants to be trendy.
[02:13:59.513 --> 02:14:01.714]  Lady, you got God to deal with.
[02:14:06.394 --> 02:14:07.295]  But just look at them.
[02:14:07.735 --> 02:14:08.916]  It's their sacrament.
[02:14:09.417 --> 02:14:11.258]  I will bring to you Moloch, my daughter.
[02:14:11.278 --> 02:14:13.440]  I will destroy her fertility.
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:14.521]  I will bow to you.
[02:14:14.541 --> 02:14:16.623]  I will give you everything you want.
[02:14:17.163 --> 02:14:19.665]  Just give me your certification of approval.
[02:14:20.125 --> 02:14:21.567]  And that is the mark of the beast.
[02:14:22.327 --> 02:14:23.488]  Look at the face of that mother.
[02:14:25.450 --> 02:14:26.871]  Look at the face of that mother right here.
[02:14:27.692 --> 02:14:29.573]  Her begging mommy, don't do it.
[02:14:29.934 --> 02:14:31.075]  We're taking your fertility.
[02:14:31.495 --> 02:14:32.716]  You're never going to have children again.
[02:14:34.454 --> 02:14:35.135]  Beyond rape.
[02:14:36.115 --> 02:14:37.076]  And there's the mother right there.
[02:14:37.116 --> 02:14:37.676]  Look at the face.
[02:14:38.897 --> 02:14:39.998]  The satisfaction.
[02:14:40.018 --> 02:14:40.799]  Look at the overhead shot.
[02:14:41.819 --> 02:14:42.360]  Look at the shot.
[02:14:44.641 --> 02:14:44.942]  Right here.
[02:14:47.183 --> 02:14:47.944]  Look at that mother.
[02:14:48.044 --> 02:14:48.304]  Right here.
[02:14:48.324 --> 02:14:49.465]  That's the overhead shot.
[02:14:51.838 --> 02:14:52.419]  Pleasure.
[02:14:53.279 --> 02:14:55.221]  The pressing on the nerve of God.
[02:14:55.861 --> 02:14:57.102]  I've got my daughter here.
[02:14:57.442 --> 02:14:59.084]  We're about to sterilize her.
[02:14:59.424 --> 02:15:01.746]  And there ain't nothing you can do to stop it.
[02:15:07.010 --> 02:15:08.351]  Yeah!
[02:15:10.072 --> 02:15:10.412]  And look.
[02:15:10.993 --> 02:15:11.613]  Look at this map.
[02:15:12.134 --> 02:15:16.037]  Before Obama, 2007, no gender transition clinics.
[02:15:16.797 --> 02:15:18.178]  And look at it after Obama.
[02:15:19.079 --> 02:15:20.580]  And the Pritzkers and all of them.
[02:15:21.877 --> 02:15:23.527]  Modern human sacrifice.
[02:15:24.492 --> 02:15:25.277]  Alright, I'm out of time.
[02:15:26.459 --> 02:15:27.199]  I'm going to go to break.
[02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:29.100]  Ivan Raiklin's about to take over.
[02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:35.383]  He'll be joining me in studio to talk about what's happening in Congress, what's happening with the border and the New World Order.
[02:15:35.403 --> 02:15:40.265]  Formerly the US Intelligence Agency, Green Beret, Patriot, straight ahead.
[02:15:40.905 --> 02:15:43.547]  Ivan Raiklin, straight ahead.
[02:15:43.587 --> 02:15:45.928]  We'll be back in four short minutes.
[02:15:46.408 --> 02:15:48.009]  But whatever you do, don't share the links.
[02:15:48.029 --> 02:15:49.029]  Don't tell people to tune in.
[02:15:49.429 --> 02:15:50.890]  We might actually win if you did that.
[02:15:51.310 --> 02:15:52.951]  No, just sit there and be murdered.
[02:15:57.799 --> 02:16:00.042]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[02:16:00.242 --> 02:16:00.582]  Thank you.
[02:16:00.762 --> 02:16:03.345]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[02:16:03.405 --> 02:16:04.647]  I started taking that stuff.
[02:16:04.687 --> 02:16:07.890]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[02:16:08.011 --> 02:16:08.912]  When did you start taking it?
[02:16:09.192 --> 02:16:13.156]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[02:16:13.337 --> 02:16:13.537]  Mm-hmm.
[02:16:13.797 --> 02:16:16.499]  And I started eating a little better, but my blood pressure stayed high.
[02:16:16.519 --> 02:16:24.025]  And when I took X2 iodine after about two or four weeks, I think my body was detoxified of a bunch of metals and stuff that my body was storing.
[02:16:24.145 --> 02:16:26.346]  And my blood pressure came down to the perfect level.
[02:16:26.747 --> 02:16:29.669]  And I tell people the only thing I did with X2 iodine
[02:16:30.129 --> 02:16:44.002]  And even though I do think all your other products are good, I recommend to anybody that they start with X2 iodine because it detoxifies your body and kind of kicks your natural DNA into full force.
[02:16:44.102 --> 02:16:47.545]  So in my life, I found X2 iodine the best.
[02:16:48.025 --> 02:16:51.468]  I tried other iodines and they didn't have the same effect.
[02:16:51.668 --> 02:16:54.091]  So X2 iodine, I really wanted to point that out.
[02:16:57.699 --> 02:17:01.823]  InfoWarsStore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.
[02:17:02.424 --> 02:17:04.346]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[02:17:04.386 --> 02:17:06.148]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[02:17:06.448 --> 02:17:08.671]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[02:17:08.911 --> 02:17:09.632]  Hey, what's better?
[02:17:09.732 --> 02:17:10.232]  Knockout.
[02:17:10.573 --> 02:17:11.153]  What's better?
[02:17:11.914 --> 02:17:12.394]  Down and out.
[02:17:12.675 --> 02:17:13.135]  What's better?
[02:17:13.195 --> 02:17:14.797]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[02:17:15.458 --> 02:17:20.383]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[02:17:21.064 --> 02:17:24.688]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[02:17:25.049 --> 02:17:26.330]  That's how our bodies work.
[02:17:26.350 --> 02:17:27.351]  They're all very diverse.
[02:17:27.672 --> 02:17:37.883]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night Sleep.

[02:17:59.893 --> 02:18:01.294]  Last year we put this book out.
[02:18:02.148 --> 02:18:03.549]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[02:18:03.569 --> 02:18:05.350]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[02:18:05.931 --> 02:18:09.173]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[02:18:09.713 --> 02:18:10.614]  The Great Awakening.
[02:18:10.714 --> 02:18:14.557]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[02:18:14.957 --> 02:18:16.618]  This is such a powerful book.
[02:18:17.018 --> 02:18:18.700]  It covers all the globalist plans.
[02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:19.800]  We're good to go.
[02:18:38.519 --> 02:18:46.007]  This is next-level information, and it's a great way to not just support the broadcast, but inform yourself of the next level and share the book with friends and family.
[02:18:46.268 --> 02:18:52.655]  So whether you want one copy or multiple copies, go now to InfoWarsStore.com and get The Great Awakening.
[02:18:52.855 --> 02:18:54.076]  This is going to go to number one.
[02:18:54.357 --> 02:18:55.398]  I want to thank you for your support.
[02:18:55.578 --> 02:18:56.379]  It's a powerful book.
[02:18:56.619 --> 02:18:57.140]  Get yours now.
[02:18:57.742 --> 02:19:01.466]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[02:19:01.806 --> 02:19:04.969]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[02:19:05.369 --> 02:19:09.833]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[02:19:10.474 --> 02:19:12.596]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[02:19:12.916 --> 02:19:20.904]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's You Will Eat the Bugs.
[02:19:21.524 --> 02:19:22.826]  This is The Great Awakening.
[02:19:23.346 --> 02:19:24.047]  We're good to go.
[02:19:38.183 --> 02:19:39.183]  We're good to go.
[02:19:39.203 --> 02:19:39.924]  We're good to go.
[02:19:39.964 --> 02:19:41.004]  We're good to go.
[02:20:21.022 --> 02:20:30.335]  All right, Ivan Ranklin's a great former Green Beret lawyer, worked for the Defense Intelligence Agency, about what's happened at the border, the New World Order, Trump, he's been heavily involved in Congress.
[02:20:31.522 --> 02:20:34.383]  Doing great work there, getting them to go after the real targets.
[02:20:34.783 --> 02:20:35.923]  Ivan, great to have you in the studio.
[02:20:36.243 --> 02:20:37.344]  And I guess you broke your leg.
[02:20:37.524 --> 02:20:39.344]  Yeah, fantastic to be here, Alex, as always.
[02:20:39.384 --> 02:20:39.825]  Yeah, I did.
[02:20:40.225 --> 02:20:41.245]  But that's not going to slow me down.
[02:20:41.565 --> 02:20:42.225]  You know what?
[02:20:42.305 --> 02:20:43.786]  I'm faster now that I'm in a wheelchair.
[02:20:43.806 --> 02:20:51.008]  Because when I'm squeaking through the halls of Congress, they're not going to be able to run from me, these octogenarian, just poisonous humans.
[02:20:52.248 --> 02:20:53.169]  So you weren't tobogganing.
[02:20:53.189 --> 02:20:54.149]  You were going on a sled.
[02:20:55.389 --> 02:20:56.010]  So here's the story.
[02:20:56.030 --> 02:20:56.650]  Here's the story.
[02:20:57.708 --> 02:21:04.152]  After I went and confronted Hunter Biden in the hallway for asking him what kind of crack do you smoke, Mr. Biden, he sent his goons after me.
[02:21:04.232 --> 02:21:05.693]  Six of them are still in the hospital.
[02:21:05.813 --> 02:21:09.815]  One I let go to let them know that, guess what, I'm coming for all of you.
[02:21:10.176 --> 02:21:13.618]  And I got that, remember that deep state target list that I introduced you to last time I was on the show?
[02:21:14.118 --> 02:21:17.240]  I got a quick video that goes into a little bit more detail if you want to play that.
[02:21:17.260 --> 02:21:17.820]  Do they have that?
[02:21:18.020 --> 02:21:18.421]  Yeah, they do.
[02:21:18.941 --> 02:21:19.821]  Guys, you have this video?
[02:21:20.322 --> 02:21:21.923]  It's two minutes and 31 seconds.
[02:21:22.263 --> 02:21:22.783]  Well, let's roll it.
[02:21:22.823 --> 02:21:23.203]  Here it is.
[02:21:23.283 --> 02:21:23.644]  Ha ha!
[02:21:37.197 --> 02:21:41.338]  Smelly for video.
[02:21:41.598 --> 02:21:46.600]  There are a lot of radio stations, too.
[02:21:46.620 --> 02:21:48.201]  All right, so I'll talk it through, then, for the radio.
[02:21:48.221 --> 02:21:49.401]  Yeah, you got the receipts.
[02:21:50.101 --> 02:22:03.686]  All right, right now, basically what we're looking at here is a list of video with the snapshots of the Twitter accounts of our deep state target list, where we're going to go after every single digital piece of evidence and residue that they left on the Internet.
[02:22:03.706 --> 02:22:04.706]  This is like one of those card decks.
[02:22:05.126 --> 02:22:07.469]  Yep, to showcase their seditious conspiracy.
[02:22:07.889 --> 02:22:09.190]  There's the treason category.
[02:22:09.210 --> 02:22:10.632]  There's the sedition category.
[02:22:11.052 --> 02:22:14.216]  Again, those that unmask Flynn, the 39 of them that have Twitter accounts.
[02:22:14.556 --> 02:22:19.001]  The 51 that provided cover for the Biden criminal syndicate laptop, their Twitter accounts.
[02:22:21.127 --> 02:22:22.148]  I'm listening to your ass.
[02:22:39.250 --> 02:22:39.611]  Right.
[02:22:40.411 --> 02:22:42.253]  By the way, people say, oh, what does this do?
[02:22:42.654 --> 02:22:49.662]  When I was talking to Trump a lot and just saying, hey, Fiona Hill, hey, General McMaster, they were flipping out in the news.
[02:22:50.102 --> 02:22:52.124]  The CIA literally followed me around harassing me.
[02:22:52.445 --> 02:22:53.966]  They were so scared of intel.
[02:22:54.347 --> 02:22:54.487]  Yeah.
[02:22:55.319 --> 02:22:58.341]  I mean, all this is is publicly available, well, not publicly available information.
[02:22:58.661 --> 02:22:59.742]  You don't need to FOIA this.
[02:23:00.343 --> 02:23:15.834]  All you need to do is say, hey, Elon Musk, change your rules of service, right, terms of service, to say, you know, in the public interest, in the interest of transparency, why don't we just take a look and see whether or not, remember what they did with, he looked at the logs, right, for you?
[02:23:15.854 --> 02:23:16.294]  Yeah.
[02:23:16.455 --> 02:23:22.059]  And it was clear that, what's that, Oliver Darcy was the one that basically... It was all, it was the Democratic Party.
[02:23:22.459 --> 02:23:23.120]  Twitter, from X.
[02:23:23.880 --> 02:23:25.661]  Well, let's take a look at their direct messages.
[02:23:25.821 --> 02:23:27.783]  All the people that I have listed here in this video.
[02:23:28.543 --> 02:23:29.984]  And we're going to find out for sure.
[02:23:30.064 --> 02:23:31.966]  I would say beyond any shadow of a doubt.
[02:23:31.986 --> 02:23:32.946]  Your mouth and God's ears.
[02:23:33.006 --> 02:23:35.448]  Explain why this is so important.
[02:23:36.088 --> 02:23:42.413]  If Michael Schellenberger and Matt Taibbi join forces with us to go ahead and look at the direct messages of all these actors right now.
[02:23:42.913 --> 02:23:58.982]  We're going to be able to showcase beyond any doubt that they conducted a seditious conspiratorial coup starting in 2016 as soon as Mike Pence was foisted on Donald Trump to be his VP pick and Crossfire Hurricane started illegally by defrauding the FISA court by spying on Carter.
[02:23:59.022 --> 02:24:00.883]  He was the main agent the whole time.
[02:24:01.063 --> 02:24:01.384]  What's that?
[02:24:01.764 --> 02:24:03.084]  Mike Pence was the agent the whole time.
[02:24:03.625 --> 02:24:04.205]  I think so.
[02:24:04.926 --> 02:24:10.409]  We'll get back to that, but just looking at the American battle space right now, what do you make of it?
[02:24:11.149 --> 02:24:15.850]  So right now, I mean, like you said in the previous segment, we got them on the ropes, right?
[02:24:15.990 --> 02:24:17.090]  They're obviously going to fight back.
[02:24:17.110 --> 02:24:18.430]  They're going to escalate against us.
[02:24:18.491 --> 02:24:19.071]  But guess what?
[02:24:19.411 --> 02:24:22.551]  We're going to be able to escalate in a... We're not going to stop.
[02:24:22.891 --> 02:24:23.051]  Right.
[02:24:23.091 --> 02:24:23.632]  We're not going to stop.
[02:24:23.652 --> 02:24:25.292]  Because now we know the game.
[02:24:25.312 --> 02:24:35.454]  We have a massively more powerful First Amendment now that you're back on X. Now that Tucker is... The view count on his content is 10X anything coming...
[02:24:35.754 --> 02:24:36.995]  He's bigger than Joe Rogan now.
[02:24:37.035 --> 02:24:37.675]  Yeah, 50 million a day.
[02:24:38.035 --> 02:24:40.137]  He's easily bigger than Joe Rogan at this point.
[02:24:40.477 --> 02:24:41.617]  So now we have a First Amendment.
[02:24:41.637 --> 02:24:43.458]  We have all these other infrastructures in play.
[02:24:44.079 --> 02:24:45.880]  Every top person is anti-globalist.
[02:24:46.620 --> 02:24:47.041]  Absolutely.
[02:24:47.461 --> 02:24:48.041]  Yeah.
[02:24:48.281 --> 02:24:50.923]  Well, top people, Elon Musk, you, Joe Rogan.
[02:24:51.023 --> 02:24:53.624]  Well, Joe Rogan's kind of slow rolling, I think, to our side.
[02:24:53.644 --> 02:24:54.345]  He's joining us, yeah.
[02:24:54.825 --> 02:24:56.646]  And then we have all the other players, right?
[02:24:57.246 --> 02:24:57.967]  Owen's back.
[02:24:58.607 --> 02:24:59.648]  He's out of jail.
[02:24:59.668 --> 02:25:00.468]  So what are they going to do, though?
[02:25:00.488 --> 02:25:01.249]  They're not going to give up.
[02:25:02.469 --> 02:25:02.590]  So...
[02:25:03.996 --> 02:25:09.978]  The easiest thing for them to do, I think, is to shut down the Internet and then move forward from there, right?
[02:25:10.278 --> 02:25:11.239]  So a cyber attack.
[02:25:11.479 --> 02:25:11.679]  Yeah.
[02:25:12.219 --> 02:25:13.379]  And they've been kind of preempting that.
[02:25:13.399 --> 02:25:15.480]  They're talking about, like you talked about, the Civil War.
[02:25:15.900 --> 02:25:19.001]  But the problem is that we've already realized what they're willing to do.
[02:25:19.061 --> 02:25:20.702]  They're willing to go violent against us.
[02:25:20.722 --> 02:25:22.462]  They're willing to... I got a shirt on today.
[02:25:23.043 --> 02:25:26.604]  They're willing to go ahead and murder folks like Air Force veteran...
[02:25:27.384 --> 02:25:28.105]  We're good to go.
[02:25:43.263 --> 02:25:46.305]  I call them at this point the domestic terrorist organization known as the Democrat Party.
[02:25:46.785 --> 02:25:56.551]  The county GOP in Maverick County, Texas, is about to deploy personnel to conduct a, they call it a protest, but who knows how out of hand it's going to get.
[02:25:56.891 --> 02:26:00.353]  And they're there to confront the National Guard to obstruct justice.
[02:26:00.473 --> 02:26:02.775]  The National Guard there is to protect our border.
[02:26:03.135 --> 02:26:04.836]  Explain that to the manipulating groups.
[02:26:05.416 --> 02:26:05.596]  Right.
[02:26:05.836 --> 02:26:22.520]  So I don't know how many people are going to show up, but I'm reading here in a report just 19 hours ago, Eagle Pass, and it says here that the leader of the Maverick County Democrat Party is going to try to stage a protest and it's going to get in the way of the National Guard.
[02:26:22.680 --> 02:26:28.402]  And that's from not only this, but also a good source within the National Guard that we received earlier today.
[02:26:29.202 --> 02:26:29.822]  And again...
[02:26:30.482 --> 02:26:38.884]  We, the convoy that I was a part of, I was there at the kickoff in Virginia Beach earlier this week on Monday, and because of my bum leg, I wasn't able to travel with them the entire period.
[02:26:38.904 --> 02:26:44.205]  I flew down yesterday, linked up with them yesterday at the rally last night.
[02:26:44.225 --> 02:26:46.065]  Ted Nugent, everybody there.
[02:26:46.445 --> 02:26:47.846]  Why weren't you there, Alex?
[02:26:48.246 --> 02:26:48.906]  I was on air.
[02:26:49.346 --> 02:26:50.466]  Okay, you're always on air.
[02:26:50.486 --> 02:26:51.466]  Appreciate millions of people.
[02:26:51.486 --> 02:26:52.166]  Ted Nugent.
[02:26:52.446 --> 02:26:54.367]  We had Sarah Palin show up.
[02:26:54.727 --> 02:26:58.508]  We had, obviously, the local crew, Doc Chambers and Vader Steele.
[02:26:58.848 --> 02:26:59.268]  I know, I know.
[02:27:01.733 --> 02:27:03.037]  Soar on stage in the tower.
[02:27:03.057 --> 02:27:05.284]  I don't know, maybe you were up there.
[02:27:05.304 --> 02:27:06.648]  No, I need to go more.
[02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:10.081]  No, we had quite a few people up there.
[02:27:10.942 --> 02:27:12.002]  Michael Yan was there.
[02:27:12.203 --> 02:27:16.866]  Some of the big players that now... Yesterday, Tucker just had with... What's his name?
[02:27:17.186 --> 02:27:18.647]  Brett Weinstein.
[02:27:19.047 --> 02:27:22.650]  Where they were talking about Michael Yan's work and exposing what's going on in the Darien Gap.
[02:27:22.690 --> 02:27:28.794]  And I think at this point, the mainstream GOP lemmings are now receiving information that we've already known for years.
[02:27:28.994 --> 02:27:29.915]  You've known for decades.
[02:27:29.975 --> 02:27:30.756]  I've known for years.
[02:27:31.216 --> 02:27:36.300]  And now it's actually being received by the lemming establishment Republicans via...
[02:27:36.920 --> 02:27:43.745]  What do you make of the intel we got that they're using NSA face recognition and saying white supremacists are going to attack?
[02:28:03.698 --> 02:28:04.959]  That's a way to try to discredit things.
[02:28:04.999 --> 02:28:05.679]  It's so pathetic.
[02:28:05.959 --> 02:28:07.881]  The Border Patrol itself says it's a false flag.
[02:28:08.461 --> 02:28:09.502]  They're not buying any of it.
[02:28:10.302 --> 02:28:12.003]  So out of the gates, the Border Patrol's not buying it.
[02:28:12.303 --> 02:28:15.105]  It's not going to work because they're not on their home turf.
[02:28:15.285 --> 02:28:27.332]  In Washington, D.C., they can do all the false flags they want and need and strive for because they have the judiciary on lock, they have the Capitol Police Board on lock because it's controlled still by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer's U.S.
[02:28:27.372 --> 02:28:28.233]  Capitol Police chief.
[02:28:28.513 --> 02:28:29.534]  But in Texas, guess what?
[02:28:30.174 --> 02:28:34.518]  I mean, at the end of the day, don't mess with Texas, and then 25 other states support Texas sovereignty.
[02:28:34.859 --> 02:28:37.061]  It's a different dynamic, and we have the advantage.
[02:28:37.141 --> 02:28:40.984]  I'm not the one saying false flag, and the feds are telling us this.
[02:28:41.164 --> 02:28:42.686]  They're like, we're going to stop the false flag.
[02:28:43.186 --> 02:28:45.709]  No, they're trying to inject themselves in order to push their agenda.
[02:28:45.829 --> 02:28:51.074]  Well, how screwed is the globalists that we're going to the feds, and they're like, we're going to stop the false flag, Jones.
[02:28:52.035 --> 02:28:53.756]  The Biden criminal... Stay there.
[02:28:53.776 --> 02:28:55.078]  We'll come right back.
[02:28:57.796 --> 02:29:01.318]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[02:29:01.719 --> 02:29:08.743]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[02:29:08.903 --> 02:29:10.905]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[02:29:11.105 --> 02:29:12.145]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[02:29:12.165 --> 02:29:12.886]  He loved the idea.
[02:29:13.226 --> 02:29:16.727]  What would you call the debate and discussion about a pro-human future?
[02:29:16.767 --> 02:29:17.628]  Just Team Humanity?
[02:29:17.708 --> 02:29:18.588]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[02:29:18.728 --> 02:29:19.168]  Absolutely.
[02:29:19.488 --> 02:29:20.889]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[02:29:20.949 --> 02:29:24.410]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[02:29:24.630 --> 02:29:32.053]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to give InfoWars on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[02:29:32.353 --> 02:29:44.060]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a revolution against the globalists, and it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[02:29:44.340 --> 02:29:45.661]  We're told humans are the problem.
[02:29:45.701 --> 02:29:46.661]  We're told we're killing the Earth.
[02:29:46.961 --> 02:29:51.224]  We're told all this garbage so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[02:29:51.524 --> 02:29:52.224]  We're not going to do that.
[02:29:52.485 --> 02:29:57.227]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[02:30:00.049 --> 02:30:01.430]  Last year we put this book out.
[02:30:02.287 --> 02:30:03.688]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[02:30:03.708 --> 02:30:05.489]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[02:30:06.069 --> 02:30:09.311]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[02:30:09.851 --> 02:30:10.752]  The Great Awakening.
[02:30:10.832 --> 02:30:14.674]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[02:30:15.094 --> 02:30:16.735]  This is such a powerful book.
[02:30:17.136 --> 02:30:18.837]  It covers all the globalist plans.
[02:30:19.497 --> 02:30:19.957]  We're good to go.
[02:30:38.652 --> 02:30:46.116]  This is next-level information, and it's a great way to not just support the broadcast, but inform yourself of the next level and share the book with friends and family.
[02:30:46.396 --> 02:30:52.759]  So whether you want one copy or multiple copies, go now to InfoWarsStore.com and get The Great Awakening.

[02:31:57.475 --> 02:32:02.779]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing, high-quality coffee has not been available.
[02:32:03.219 --> 02:32:07.603]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[02:32:08.063 --> 02:32:10.525]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[02:32:11.085 --> 02:32:20.473]  But now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.
[02:32:20.673 --> 02:32:23.295]  It's powered by the company Minute Man Coffee.
[02:32:23.895 --> 02:32:31.942]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best-tasting, best-smelling, strongest coffee that I have ever drank.

[02:33:09.631 --> 02:33:15.456]  All right, Ivan Raiklin, former Defense Intelligence Agency lawyer at Ring Beret, is our guest.
[02:33:17.924 --> 02:33:18.544]  Expand that.
[02:33:19.164 --> 02:33:22.065]  The Deep State Marauder is here in studio.
[02:33:22.145 --> 02:33:24.366]  Frontline Report.
[02:33:24.486 --> 02:33:28.447]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:28.527 --> 02:33:32.268]  So you've been a little busy beaver in Congress.
[02:33:32.288 --> 02:33:33.768]  There's quite a fight for the republic.
[02:33:34.328 --> 02:33:37.049]  We got 30 minutes left before the next guest takes over.
[02:33:37.069 --> 02:33:37.649]  What do you want to cover?
[02:33:38.570 --> 02:33:41.431]  No, let's talk about, I think, like we talked about before.
[02:33:41.471 --> 02:33:41.911]  We're winning.
[02:33:41.931 --> 02:33:43.152]  We're incrementally winning.
[02:33:43.292 --> 02:33:45.312]  One line of effort that... I wouldn't lie to listeners.
[02:33:45.352 --> 02:33:45.933]  We are winning.
[02:33:46.073 --> 02:33:46.713]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:33:47.073 --> 02:33:50.074]  One line of effort is that... Remember the Declaration of Military Accountability?
[02:33:50.174 --> 02:33:51.095]  I'm one of the signers of the 231.
[02:33:52.015 --> 02:33:54.816]  Six of us actually were together at that rally yesterday.
[02:33:55.496 --> 02:33:59.380]  And for those that don't remember, take a look at it, militaryaccountability.com.
[02:33:59.420 --> 02:34:04.524]  And the main focus here is we're here to admonish the lawless, encourage the faint-hearted, and strengthen the weak.
[02:34:04.864 --> 02:34:11.170]  And the way we do that is we're going to clean our own house, our own institution, first and foremost, which is the Department of Defense.
[02:34:11.510 --> 02:34:19.637]  So majority, almost all except for one of the 230 are either current service members or former service members.
[02:34:19.818 --> 02:34:21.139]  And it blew up.
[02:34:21.179 --> 02:34:22.300]  Tens of thousands signed on.
[02:34:22.560 --> 02:34:25.843]  Yeah, so I think we're at 30,000, 40,000 that have signed on.
[02:34:26.823 --> 02:34:30.486]  And at this point, it's reached maybe 50 million.
[02:34:30.506 --> 02:34:33.609]  And we're at the border, and the Border Patrol is giving us everything.
[02:34:34.409 --> 02:34:36.371]  Like, here's our secret documents.
[02:34:36.411 --> 02:34:37.452]  Here's their operations.
[02:34:37.792 --> 02:34:38.973]  We're trying to stop a false flag.
[02:34:38.993 --> 02:34:40.374]  That's going to really upset the globalists.
[02:34:40.754 --> 02:34:43.857]  Yeah, so we're trying to basically claw back our institutions with patriots.
[02:34:44.377 --> 02:34:51.523]  So now we're in a position where, with the information you're putting out on X, with Tucker, with X in general, with Elon Musk, we're now in a position...
[02:34:51.983 --> 02:35:08.210]  To showcase that what happened in 2020, not only with the illegal election, but then the subsequent cover-ups, but then in addition to that, the illegal DOD clot-shot mandate, and the book that outlines every single aspect of... You told me to read this page, but you read it.
[02:35:08.371 --> 02:35:08.991]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:35:10.731 --> 02:35:11.211]  We're good to go.
[02:35:39.956 --> 02:35:40.457]  We're good to go.
[02:35:49.605 --> 02:35:50.045]  I'm going to read it.
[02:36:16.510 --> 02:36:16.670]  I think.
[02:36:45.112 --> 02:36:56.398]  The JAG that signed off on that general was a guy by the name of Army Colonel Yevgeny Vindman, who was the brother of the fake whistleblower Alexander Vindman.
[02:36:56.818 --> 02:36:58.919]  Does that make sense?
[02:36:58.939 --> 02:37:07.664]  This incestuous relationship between these seditious co-conspirators that when you go back and watch the video that we posted at the beginning of this segment,
[02:37:08.416 --> 02:37:09.197]  They're all in there.
[02:37:09.477 --> 02:37:15.161]  And when we open up all of their direct messages, I'm already getting hate on all the trolls coming out.
[02:37:15.181 --> 02:37:20.104]  Oh, they're tagging the domestic terrorist organization known as the FBI that they need to stop me from looking in.
[02:37:20.124 --> 02:37:24.167]  They're hitting us with a billion requests an hour trying to shut down M4s for a week straight.
[02:37:24.607 --> 02:37:26.929]  We're talking tens of millions of dollars to attack right now.
[02:37:27.189 --> 02:37:27.649]  It's failed.
[02:37:27.669 --> 02:37:28.210]  We're still up.
[02:37:28.230 --> 02:37:29.250]  But they're panicking right now.
[02:37:30.131 --> 02:37:30.791]  Yeah, they're panicking.
[02:37:30.972 --> 02:37:31.552]  Because guess what?
[02:37:31.952 --> 02:37:37.896]  Just like Jack Smith used Twitter to go ahead and look into Donald Trump's Twitter account.
[02:37:38.096 --> 02:37:40.478]  He said, give me every person that would like Trump.
[02:37:41.199 --> 02:37:47.203]  I want to see every single person that has communicated with Jamie Raskin, with Adam Schiff on Twitter.
[02:37:47.223 --> 02:37:47.643]  Sue them.
[02:37:48.323 --> 02:37:48.884]  All of their staffers.
[02:37:48.924 --> 02:37:50.465]  The thing is, we should be intimidated.
[02:37:50.485 --> 02:37:52.006]  We should be honored they're coming after us.
[02:37:52.326 --> 02:37:54.047]  Because we're a lot more of us than them.
[02:37:54.227 --> 02:37:55.048]  Let's go on offense.
[02:37:55.328 --> 02:37:56.529]  How do we motivate Elon Musk to do this?
[02:38:00.389 --> 02:38:00.930]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:38:01.411 --> 02:38:03.756]  I think Elon's already got all the data in his hands.
[02:38:03.857 --> 02:38:04.899]  He's already got all the cylinders.
[02:38:04.959 --> 02:38:05.861]  I don't know what he's going to do.
[02:38:07.365 --> 02:38:07.886]  So there you go.
[02:38:08.086 --> 02:38:08.547]  That's the book.
[02:38:09.827 --> 02:38:12.428]  Now, declaration of military accountability, right?
[02:38:13.009 --> 02:38:20.953]  We promise to exhaust all moral, ethical, and legal means to restore the rule of law, and we'll begin by attempting to hold senior military leaders accountable.
[02:38:21.373 --> 02:38:28.377]  This should be the template for, if you're a whistleblower in DHS or sick of what's going on there, you need to come out and do something similar to this.
[02:38:28.557 --> 02:38:29.277]  People don't get it.
[02:38:29.557 --> 02:38:31.378]  More and more military leaders saying no.
[02:38:31.398 --> 02:38:32.319]  Other people hear about it.
[02:38:32.839 --> 02:38:33.699]  That's a chain reaction.
[02:38:33.979 --> 02:38:43.382]  Now, Brad Miller, who's kind of our de facto spokesperson for this declaration, did a recording with Tucker Carlson, and I think that should be airing next week.
[02:38:43.662 --> 02:38:56.146]  I think once that's out there in the broader public, the lemming Republicans are going to start to take notice, and those that were not complicit in what I call the COVID coercion and the mandate molestation, they're going to basically see it for what it was.
[02:38:56.526 --> 02:38:57.947]  They were all duped, and guess what?
[02:38:57.967 --> 02:39:00.968]  I think all of them were duped by the same individuals
[02:39:01.488 --> 02:39:02.269]  I think we're good to go.
[02:39:02.289 --> 02:39:03.110]  I think we're good to go.
[02:39:20.526 --> 02:39:21.447]  We're good to go.
[02:39:21.467 --> 02:39:22.567]  We're good to go.
[02:39:40.819 --> 02:39:41.279]  We're good to go.
[02:39:41.319 --> 02:39:41.520]  I think?
[02:40:01.334 --> 02:40:07.738]  He's the number three guy at the San Francisco field office of the FBI coordinating still the censorship regime.
[02:40:08.078 --> 02:40:12.380]  And guess who was the supervisory intelligence analyst on Crossfire Hurricane?
[02:40:12.740 --> 02:40:14.221]  Guess where he is now?
[02:40:14.882 --> 02:40:25.988]  He's over at the Foreign Influence Task Force at FBI headquarters coordinating with Joseph Pienka and Elvis Chan, who we found out about in the Missouri v. Biden lawsuit of the First Amendment.
[02:40:26.568 --> 02:40:29.270]  Kind of destruction scheme of the Biden criminal syndicate.
[02:40:29.710 --> 02:40:39.336]  All these individuals are still in place, and Christopher, what I like to call Christopher Ray Epps, the FBI director, is the one providing top cover for all of them.
[02:40:39.656 --> 02:40:40.297]  But guess what?
[02:40:40.697 --> 02:40:50.723]  When we start to go into those DMs, Elon Musk, wink, wink, if you allow the public to see all this, everything will be proven beyond any doubt.
[02:40:51.083 --> 02:40:52.464]  And then we go after them.
[02:40:54.560 --> 02:40:55.201]  They had to have.
[02:40:55.561 --> 02:40:58.863]  If they did, because that's the easiest mechanism to obtain evidence.
[02:40:58.883 --> 02:41:00.985]  Because if we do a FOIA, what are they going to do?
[02:41:01.005 --> 02:41:01.926]  They're going to block it.
[02:41:02.206 --> 02:41:03.627]  They're going to totally block everything.
[02:41:03.927 --> 02:41:07.590]  We're going to use the same precedent of good old Jackie Boy Smith.
[02:41:08.571 --> 02:41:12.594]  What do you make of a lawyer as a former lawyer?
[02:41:13.494 --> 02:41:18.699]  On Fannie Willis in Georgia and the New York... She's on my list, too.
[02:41:19.379 --> 02:41:24.183]  The New York real estate trial with no jury and then the E. Jean Carroll.
[02:41:24.203 --> 02:41:27.426]  I mean, that has, like, really backfired on them, but they keep doubling down.
[02:41:28.227 --> 02:41:33.631]  They think that if they apply enough pressure, Trump and us are going to back down.
[02:41:33.972 --> 02:41:34.732]  No, it doesn't work.
[02:41:35.093 --> 02:41:37.855]  So they got most of the lemmings, right?
[02:41:37.875 --> 02:41:38.435]  They duped them.
[02:41:39.176 --> 02:41:42.257]  They got those that were kind of hesitated.
[02:41:42.778 --> 02:41:50.601]  What they didn't get were those that were not going to bend a knee at all costs, meaning you, me, and the people that are propping up.
[02:41:50.621 --> 02:41:51.281]  Well, they've done it.
[02:41:51.301 --> 02:41:52.702]  Separated things made it very clear.
[02:41:52.982 --> 02:41:56.624]  Right, and now we're going to expose every single component of them.
[02:41:56.704 --> 02:41:59.705]  If there's any level of corruption, and we're seeing it, Fannie Willard.
[02:41:59.725 --> 02:42:00.465]  Well, that's what they don't get.
[02:42:00.505 --> 02:42:01.506]  I'm not the toughest guy around.
[02:42:01.526 --> 02:42:02.666]  We're going to do the same thing to them.
[02:42:02.686 --> 02:42:03.587]  Well, I'm under attack.
[02:42:04.582 --> 02:42:05.082]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:42:05.122 --> 02:42:05.862]  How does that end?
[02:42:35.441 --> 02:42:39.024]  Well, I think you mentioned it earlier in one of your shows a few weeks ago.
[02:42:39.625 --> 02:42:41.606]  It's either mutually assured destruction or we win.
[02:42:42.067 --> 02:42:44.349]  It's up to them on how they want it to end.
[02:42:45.530 --> 02:42:46.891]  Do you think they know they're losing?
[02:42:46.911 --> 02:42:47.792]  Because they are losing.
[02:42:49.898 --> 02:42:52.400]  I think they do, and that's why they're maneuvering.
[02:42:52.861 --> 02:42:56.484]  Remember Vijaya Gade, the general counsel at Twitter?
[02:42:56.504 --> 02:42:56.764]  Yeah.
[02:42:56.824 --> 02:42:58.025]  She had a nervous breakdown.
[02:42:58.105 --> 02:43:02.409]  She was crying when we saw reports of it when Elon Musk was going to buy X on Twitter.
[02:43:03.289 --> 02:43:05.751]  He hasn't leveraged everything that he has.
[02:43:05.771 --> 02:43:08.073]  He has dirt on everything.
[02:43:08.113 --> 02:43:11.076]  Imagine if you were sitting on everyone's direct message.
[02:43:11.096 --> 02:43:11.937]  I think you should attack.
[02:43:12.097 --> 02:43:12.998]  I think you should release all.
[02:43:13.871 --> 02:43:16.192]  So, I mean, what's the calculus as a business guy?
[02:43:16.212 --> 02:43:17.092]  I think he's in more danger now.
[02:43:17.132 --> 02:43:18.433]  He's released every damn bit of it.
[02:43:18.713 --> 02:43:21.494]  If he releases it all, I mean, that's it.
[02:43:21.854 --> 02:43:22.774]  The entire regime collapses.
[02:43:22.794 --> 02:43:26.396]  The Democrats are literally arrogantly talking about they're going to suppress an election.
[02:43:26.756 --> 02:43:27.716]  It's the coup.
[02:43:27.956 --> 02:43:29.637]  It's a coup d'etat.
[02:43:29.837 --> 02:43:30.997]  I think they're waiting on him.
[02:43:32.098 --> 02:43:36.219]  I think Elon is probably waiting on them to take a more bolder, aggressive move on him.
[02:43:36.440 --> 02:43:37.980]  That's Elon's M.O.
[02:43:38.060 --> 02:43:38.820]  He waits till the end.
[02:43:38.840 --> 02:43:40.021]  And then he'll just smash them.
[02:43:41.141 --> 02:43:42.441]  And this is one easy way to smash it.
[02:43:42.461 --> 02:43:43.562]  That's a smart algorithm.
[02:43:44.682 --> 02:43:47.682]  If you think you control the attack, he always waits for the attack.
[02:43:48.643 --> 02:43:49.283]  And then he attacks.
[02:43:49.323 --> 02:43:51.783]  Because then the court of public opinion is on his side when he does it.
[02:43:51.903 --> 02:43:56.404]  Because right now, they might not be as aggressive as what they could be.
[02:43:57.064 --> 02:43:58.765]  And they have no other option.
[02:43:58.825 --> 02:43:59.625]  Let's face it, Alex.
[02:44:00.585 --> 02:44:05.146]  If they allow the election to be run free and fair...
[02:44:06.414 --> 02:44:07.555]  Trump decimates them, right?
[02:44:08.256 --> 02:44:09.517]  It's not even close.
[02:44:09.937 --> 02:44:10.558]  And what happens?
[02:44:10.578 --> 02:44:11.478]  What's the subsequent move?
[02:44:11.799 --> 02:44:13.360]  I become the Secretary of Retribution.
[02:44:14.962 --> 02:44:19.405]  And you're in Congress running around really setting brush fires.
[02:44:19.586 --> 02:44:22.748]  I mean, Congress used to be super ignorant.
[02:44:22.768 --> 02:44:24.430]  They seem to be more smart now about what's happening.
[02:44:25.785 --> 02:44:26.445]  I don't know about that.
[02:44:26.485 --> 02:44:29.606]  I mean, there's pockets of capacity.
[02:44:29.967 --> 02:44:33.628]  Yeah, I mean, people like us, we're forcing their hand.
[02:44:33.968 --> 02:44:35.789]  I'm communicating with Congress early on.
[02:44:35.969 --> 02:44:39.990]  So I started communicating once we won the Congress on the 118th Congress started January 3rd of 2023.
[02:44:41.751 --> 02:44:43.632]  And back then, they were clueless.
[02:44:44.012 --> 02:44:50.594]  And then as things developed, I started working and talking to the different committees, or at least attending the different hearings.
[02:44:50.834 --> 02:44:54.435]  And as I attended the different hearings, I obviously had access to people and started communicating with them.
[02:44:54.755 --> 02:44:55.356]  Well, guess what?
[02:44:55.836 --> 02:45:10.561]  Now that the committee that has responsibility for exposing and analyzing and researching what actually happened on January 6th, the Fed-surrection parliamentary coup, the guy that runs that subcommittee is a guy by the name of Congressman Barry Loudermilk from Georgia.
[02:45:11.221 --> 02:45:16.384]  And just yesterday I saw that he posted something on Instagarbage, right?
[02:45:17.044 --> 02:45:23.808]  And they censored it because he's starting to get to almost the point where we already know that it was a Fed's direction set up.
[02:45:24.349 --> 02:45:25.409]  He's laying out the case.
[02:45:25.429 --> 02:45:25.930]  Which is great.
[02:45:25.950 --> 02:45:27.331]  Go ahead and censor members of Congress.
[02:45:27.371 --> 02:45:27.971]  Now they double down.
[02:45:28.231 --> 02:45:30.672]  Yeah, so now they're doubling down, which means what?
[02:45:31.172 --> 02:45:33.033]  Now they're going to start publishing on Rumble.
[02:45:33.573 --> 02:45:46.157]  If I were an analyst, which I am, I would expect that more and more J6 video evidence to support what's been identified by that particular committee is going to start rolling out pretty soon.
[02:45:46.177 --> 02:45:51.038]  How big is the new stuff that a Fed planted the bomb and a Fed found the bomb?
[02:45:54.792 --> 02:45:55.472]  It's hard to say.
[02:45:55.792 --> 02:45:58.333]  A lot of people don't understand the component of what happened on January 6th.
[02:45:58.373 --> 02:46:00.973]  Can we pull up this one slide that I sent to... Wherever you want.
[02:46:00.993 --> 02:46:01.854]  Tell them to play it.
[02:46:01.914 --> 02:46:02.614]  Play the clip you want.
[02:46:02.634 --> 02:46:03.034]  Wherever you want.
[02:46:03.314 --> 02:46:07.155]  Bring up the Capitol Police Board slide from January 6th of 2021.
[02:46:07.555 --> 02:46:11.156]  This is the insider's insider baseball game, Alex, which no one understands.
[02:46:11.216 --> 02:46:13.896]  Everybody goes after the FBI, which, yeah, they were in on it.
[02:46:13.996 --> 02:46:14.356]  I get it.
[02:46:14.856 --> 02:46:15.877]  Everyone goes after the FBI.
[02:46:15.897 --> 02:46:17.097]  They're just more like a cover-up.
[02:46:17.117 --> 02:46:17.597]  They're the bias.
[02:46:18.177 --> 02:46:20.058]  So it's an onion scheme.
[02:46:20.118 --> 02:46:37.906]  So when you look at this slide here, the very first part, if you were Owen Schroyer and you were, I guess, charged with something, whatever it was, a transgression on January 6th, or if you committed a crime on January 6th, or not January 6th, but on the Capitol grounds and weren't charged,
[02:46:38.346 --> 02:46:42.487]  It was because it was the decision-making process of the people that you're looking at right here.
[02:46:42.527 --> 02:46:47.628]  Those in that circle or that whatever polygon shape are the three members of the Capitol Police Board.
[02:46:47.989 --> 02:46:53.130]  And they're the ones that decide the law enforcement component of what happens on the Capitol Police Grounds.
[02:46:53.430 --> 02:47:04.953]  So if Nancy Pelosi is appointing the House Sergeant-at-Arms, if the Senate Majority Leader, it was McConnell back then on January 6th, is appointing the Senate Sergeant-at-Arms, and then you control the Capitol Police Chief...
[02:47:05.768 --> 02:47:06.088]  The next slide.
[02:47:24.582 --> 02:47:32.873]  You're going to see that the only person that remains from January 6th in this entire construct, which is found in Title II of the U.S.
[02:47:32.913 --> 02:47:37.419]  Code, Chapter 29, this whole construct, is the General Counsel of the Capitol Police.
[02:47:38.755 --> 02:47:42.957]  And guess who the Capitol Police Chief is now since July 23rd of 2021?
[02:47:43.557 --> 02:47:45.858]  It's Thomas Manger, who's married to a woman.
[02:47:46.558 --> 02:47:50.340]  They live in Jamie Raskin's congressional district and they're pretty close.
[02:47:50.960 --> 02:47:56.203]  So when you start to do the link analysis of all these people and you start to try to figure things out,
[02:47:56.883 --> 02:48:11.409]  The reason why, in October, the insurrection in the Cannon Building, no one was arrested, it's because it was a Democrat op and the Capitol Police chief who was appointed by Pelosi and Schumer's sergeants at arms back in July of 21 is not going to prosecute them.
[02:48:11.809 --> 02:48:14.630]  But if you're somebody that they need to politically persecute,
[02:48:15.330 --> 02:48:18.073]  What's going to happen now is the general public knows it was staged.
[02:48:33.690 --> 02:48:35.031]  I mean, we're down there at the border.
[02:48:35.051 --> 02:48:37.272]  The feds all go, oh, they're about to stay January 6th.
[02:48:37.572 --> 02:48:39.913]  The feds, the NSA's blowing the whistle.
[02:48:39.933 --> 02:48:42.915]  The feds, I mean, the feds are telling us, we don't want a new January 6th.
[02:48:43.295 --> 02:48:44.075]  Biden's doing it.
[02:48:44.155 --> 02:48:45.656]  I mean, they've screwed themselves.
[02:48:45.776 --> 02:48:47.697]  Everyone now knows about false flags.
[02:48:47.737 --> 02:48:48.837]  Years ago, nobody knew about that.
[02:48:49.778 --> 02:48:52.379]  Agreed, but the point here is that we have to identify.
[02:48:52.399 --> 02:48:52.919]  I get it.
[02:48:53.140 --> 02:48:58.662]  You can say feds, but we need to be more meticulous on identifying who they are.
[02:48:58.702 --> 02:49:00.543]  So what do you make of the pipe bomb info coming out?
[02:49:00.923 --> 02:49:01.824]  So the pipe bomb info.
[02:49:03.137 --> 02:49:11.363]  So the RNC, the lady that identified the pipe bomb at the RNC, handed that information over to one of the security guards at the RNC.
[02:49:11.423 --> 02:49:14.846]  I've talked to him numerous times, and I'm hoping that the committee is going to start talking to this guy.
[02:49:15.526 --> 02:49:16.907]  He called it in to the U.S.
[02:49:16.948 --> 02:49:17.588]  Capitol Police.
[02:49:17.808 --> 02:49:20.210]  So the RNC response was done by the U.S.
[02:49:20.230 --> 02:49:22.452]  Capitol Police because that guy was a former U.S.
[02:49:22.472 --> 02:49:23.352]  Capitol Police officer.
[02:49:23.653 --> 02:49:27.215]  The response over at the DNC was done by the D.C.
[02:49:27.255 --> 02:49:30.238]  Metro because that area has concurrent jurisdiction between U.S.
[02:49:30.258 --> 02:49:31.479]  Capitol and D.C.
[02:49:31.519 --> 02:49:31.819]  Metro.
[02:49:32.119 --> 02:49:32.680]  We're good to go.
[02:49:50.839 --> 02:49:51.259]  We're good to go.
[02:49:51.279 --> 02:49:51.419]  I think?
[02:50:11.283 --> 02:50:12.444]  ...testimony before the J.C.
[02:50:12.484 --> 02:50:13.345]  And you know they did it.
[02:50:13.405 --> 02:50:18.188]  I want to see Akinilo Gunnell, who has a Twitter account, and his communications with that guy.
[02:50:18.508 --> 02:50:21.310]  I want to see his communications between him and Jamie Raskin.
[02:50:21.710 --> 02:50:29.336]  And not only that, I demand that Barry Loudermilk subpoena all of the internal communications of the General Counsel of the U.S.
[02:50:29.356 --> 02:50:39.863]  Capitol Police, the Capitol Police Chief, current, former, and all the leadership to include Julie Farnham and Yogananda Pittman, who were head of the Intel and Interagency Coordination Division.
[02:50:39.943 --> 02:50:40.664]  Well, that said...
[02:50:41.504 --> 02:50:43.585]  That said, they're trying to say... That will show everything, Alex.
[02:50:43.966 --> 02:50:47.048]  Everything about the Fed's direction coup, in my opinion.
[02:50:48.388 --> 02:50:50.590]  What do you think Trump's biggest obstacles are right now?
[02:50:52.351 --> 02:50:52.831]  That right there.
[02:50:53.291 --> 02:50:54.972]  I know I'm like a beaten and dead horse.
[02:50:55.593 --> 02:50:58.714]  If he wants to dispense with his D.C.
[02:50:58.774 --> 02:51:03.998]  trial with Jack Smith, he has to shine the light on every single act of the Capitol Police.
[02:51:04.038 --> 02:51:04.358]  I saw that.
[02:51:04.818 --> 02:51:05.238]  Talk about that.
[02:51:05.639 --> 02:51:07.500]  Yeah, I think if they took it off the docket, I...
[02:51:08.881 --> 02:51:10.022]  I haven't really thought through this.
[02:51:10.082 --> 02:51:15.569]  My initial reaction is that they see the writing is on the wall.
[02:51:16.010 --> 02:51:16.731]  It backfired.
[02:51:16.831 --> 02:51:18.252]  I could tell them.
[02:51:18.673 --> 02:51:20.355]  I don't have some computer program.
[02:51:21.076 --> 02:51:22.137]  Trump, people love him.
[02:51:22.257 --> 02:51:23.739]  Prosecuting makes him more popular.
[02:51:24.580 --> 02:51:25.321]  And they didn't expect it.
[02:51:25.341 --> 02:51:31.706]  I think Paul Ryan... I think I saw Paul Ryan making a statement that, ooh, I didn't think that he was going to be so much more popular.
[02:51:31.726 --> 02:51:37.331]  So they're going back to the drawing board trying to figure out... Oh, even Axelrod went on Meet the Press and said, oh, he shouldn't have done this.
[02:51:37.591 --> 02:51:37.771]  Yeah.
[02:51:37.971 --> 02:51:38.352]  Stop!
[02:51:38.752 --> 02:51:39.853]  It only made him more popular.
[02:51:39.873 --> 02:51:40.493]  But at this point, it's...
[02:51:41.434 --> 02:51:42.174]  It's off the rails.
[02:51:42.334 --> 02:51:43.475]  They're not going to be able to stop it.
[02:51:43.515 --> 02:51:45.936]  I think the only... So what do they do?
[02:51:46.196 --> 02:51:47.256]  Stage a terror attack?
[02:51:47.356 --> 02:51:54.639]  Most probable course of action, in my opinion, of the enemy, meaning the unit party, both are the China First Republicans... The hijackers of America.
[02:51:54.659 --> 02:51:55.819]  ...and the China First Democrats.
[02:51:56.500 --> 02:52:11.085]  They're going to continue to try to keep him off the ballot where they can, try to make it so that he is not able to secure the necessary delegates going into the RNC convention, and if he does... Which they charged him for doing himself, trying...
[02:52:11.445 --> 02:52:11.665]  Right.
[02:52:12.065 --> 02:52:14.706]  And so, remember, the RNC convention is going to be in Milwaukee.
[02:52:15.127 --> 02:52:16.247]  So we're looking at July.
[02:52:16.987 --> 02:52:30.253]  If he ends up securing, if they're not able to block him from getting the majority and securing the nomination in July, I suspect that the Uniparty is going to go ahead and put Michelle Obama as president for the Democrats and Gavin Newsom as the VP.
[02:52:30.873 --> 02:52:32.074]  So let's answer this question.
[02:52:32.174 --> 02:52:33.194]  No one has said this.
[02:52:34.035 --> 02:52:35.235]  And we want to get Trump in.
[02:52:35.315 --> 02:52:36.376]  He's the real president.
[02:52:36.396 --> 02:52:36.776]  We know that.
[02:52:38.675 --> 02:52:39.356]  I mean, what does that do?
[02:52:59.389 --> 02:53:02.191]  I will say... They've turned him into literally Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[02:53:02.671 --> 02:53:03.652]  Yeah, one point.
[02:53:03.992 --> 02:53:10.457]  So they either try to foist... If he's going to basically win, they're going to try to foist a Nikki Haley or another handler like they did in the first term.
[02:53:10.757 --> 02:53:13.058]  But that's still too dangerous for them, right?
[02:53:13.078 --> 02:53:14.139]  Because we're coming for them, right?
[02:53:14.419 --> 02:53:15.240]  We're going to clean house.
[02:53:15.700 --> 02:53:16.521]  So then what do they do?
[02:53:16.561 --> 02:53:22.465]  They're going to potentially go to the 1960s model where they do an MLK, JFK, or an RFK on him.
[02:53:22.505 --> 02:53:23.505]  Kill a bunch of people.
[02:53:23.986 --> 02:53:24.826]  On Trump, right?
[02:53:25.767 --> 02:53:27.468]  Once they start killing, I think they'll stop at Trump.
[02:53:28.148 --> 02:53:28.809]  Here's what I'll say.
[02:53:29.829 --> 02:53:34.632]  This is a message directly to every single person on the deep state target list.
[02:53:35.073 --> 02:53:43.758]  My assessment, Ivan Raiklin's assessment, that if you assassinate any political presidential candidate, whether it's RFK, whether it's Trump,
[02:53:44.318 --> 02:53:44.798]  Guess what?
[02:53:45.219 --> 02:53:47.640]  America will do the following.
[02:53:48.200 --> 02:53:48.881]  Immediately.
[02:53:49.361 --> 02:53:51.182]  They will respond in kind.
[02:53:51.602 --> 02:53:54.584]  And they know who you are because we've created the list.
[02:53:54.884 --> 02:53:56.605]  And that's a major Rubicon.
[02:53:56.646 --> 02:53:57.326]  They should know that.
[02:53:57.506 --> 02:53:58.146]  Immediately.
[02:53:58.527 --> 02:54:00.348]  You're going to see immediate response.
[02:54:00.668 --> 02:54:03.310]  And there are only a few buildings in Washington, D.C.
[02:54:03.570 --> 02:54:05.451]  that they will probably do that.
[02:54:06.311 --> 02:54:08.273]  Well, I hope that's not the case, but these people are crazy.
[02:54:09.033 --> 02:54:12.035]  And having said that, if they do that...
[02:54:14.224 --> 02:54:20.249]  Option two behind Trump is going to be so much better for us and so much worse for them.
[02:54:20.269 --> 02:54:23.112]  I was about to say, if they kill him, that's best case scenario.
[02:54:23.352 --> 02:54:24.353]  From a sick level.
[02:54:24.713 --> 02:54:26.014]  From a sick level beating him.
[02:54:26.375 --> 02:54:28.116]  Oh, please kill him.
[02:54:28.917 --> 02:54:30.198]  It's so good after that.
[02:54:31.519 --> 02:54:37.564]  It's going to be the best cleansing and the fastest cleansing that we've ever seen in my lifetime.
[02:54:38.565 --> 02:54:40.266]  I assess...
[02:54:41.215 --> 02:54:43.438]  I'm actually scared of that, though.
[02:54:43.458 --> 02:54:44.059]  It's so explosive.
[02:54:44.079 --> 02:54:44.199]  It is.
[02:54:56.274 --> 02:54:58.837]  That's why, I mean, it's basically, it's a warning to them, right?
[02:54:59.438 --> 02:55:04.745]  If they cross the Rubicon, you saw how popular he was by just prosecuting.
[02:55:04.765 --> 02:55:06.927]  When I get close to the side guys, it's not a pussy thing.
[02:55:07.428 --> 02:55:10.031]  I start getting tears because my brain goes in overdrive.
[02:55:10.432 --> 02:55:14.016]  And when I start hearing about Trump being sassy, I start, like, literally, because my brain is like...
[02:55:14.777 --> 02:55:15.478]  So I've thought through this.
[02:55:15.518 --> 02:55:16.740]  I mean, you think through this.
[02:55:16.980 --> 02:55:17.801]  It's a chess game, right?
[02:55:17.922 --> 02:55:19.984]  Second, third, fourth move, fifth move.
[02:55:20.445 --> 02:55:23.609]  And if they do that, it's... Well, I pray for Trump not to be killed.
[02:55:23.629 --> 02:55:24.931]  It's going to accelerate.
[02:55:25.171 --> 02:55:28.676]  If they're dumb enough to kill him, though, they have literally ended us total victory.
[02:55:29.097 --> 02:55:29.237]  Yeah.
[02:55:31.036 --> 02:55:31.677]  So here's my assessment.
[02:55:31.697 --> 02:55:32.777]  I think they're dumb enough to do it, though.
[02:55:33.138 --> 02:55:40.742]  Then it begs the question, well, who within the deep state or the globalist unit party is going to be the one behind that potential assassination?
[02:55:41.322 --> 02:55:43.363]  I say there's two main options that I've thought through.
[02:55:43.723 --> 02:55:49.526]  Number one, they call on John Kerry to coordinate with his Iranian buddy, Mullahs, right?
[02:55:49.566 --> 02:55:50.247]  Oh, yeah.
[02:55:50.287 --> 02:55:51.668]  They're going to activate super cells.
[02:55:51.688 --> 02:55:53.769]  They're going to make it look like the Iranians...
[02:55:54.568 --> 02:55:54.888]  I agree.
[02:55:54.908 --> 02:55:56.210]  You're genius.
[02:55:56.370 --> 02:55:56.690]  I agree.
[02:55:56.870 --> 02:55:57.751]  They're going to use Iranians.
[02:55:57.811 --> 02:55:58.612]  That's what's being set up.
[02:55:58.632 --> 02:56:00.033]  And that's what you're seeing, right?
[02:56:00.053 --> 02:56:01.295]  Some of the skirmishes going on with Iran?
[02:56:01.315 --> 02:56:02.536]  They're going to claim Iran did it.
[02:56:03.590 --> 02:56:04.751]  Oh my God, that's it.
[02:56:05.132 --> 02:56:10.017]  You already had that set up with the Iranians a couple years ago.
[02:56:10.197 --> 02:56:11.178]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:56:11.439 --> 02:56:13.140]  Just like the FBI did in the 60s.
[02:56:13.160 --> 02:56:15.223]  But no one's going to buy it.
[02:56:15.303 --> 02:56:17.705]  If you kill Trump, folks, we know it's not the Iranians.
[02:56:18.106 --> 02:56:18.286]  Right.
[02:56:18.807 --> 02:56:24.513]  John Kerry, if you're listening in, we are watching all your communications, maybe or maybe not.
[02:56:27.179 --> 02:56:27.659]  You're dead on.
[02:56:27.679 --> 02:56:29.861]  They're going to use the Iranians as a cover.
[02:56:30.381 --> 02:56:32.803]  Because I did that at Mar-a-Lago story a few years ago.
[02:56:32.823 --> 02:56:33.483]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:56:33.503 --> 02:56:39.547]  Remember they did the little video trying to make it look like... Because at the end of the day, Iran has a vested interest, right?
[02:56:39.707 --> 02:56:41.108]  Because they want payback from Iran.
[02:56:41.128 --> 02:56:42.589]  And Iran is definitely in bed with the left.
[02:56:43.710 --> 02:56:43.850]  Yeah.
[02:56:45.091 --> 02:56:45.491]  Absolutely.
[02:56:45.952 --> 02:56:46.772]  Jesus Christ.
[02:56:47.953 --> 02:56:50.535]  And so, which begs the question, I'm going to ask you this question, Alex.
[02:56:51.435 --> 02:56:55.338]  Who then takes the reign if they do that to Trump?
[02:56:59.528 --> 02:57:01.290]  I don't know.
[02:57:01.310 --> 02:57:01.751]  You do know.
[02:57:03.172 --> 02:57:03.453]  Who?
[02:57:04.754 --> 02:57:05.395]  Patrick Carlson?
[02:57:06.276 --> 02:57:06.856]  Let me think about it.
[02:57:07.257 --> 02:57:10.821]  Who's in the best position to completely castrate the deep state and crush the commies?
[02:57:11.181 --> 02:57:16.888]  That has the understanding of the national security order to go ahead and just clean house.
[02:57:17.108 --> 02:57:17.989]  He can't be president.
[02:57:18.189 --> 02:57:18.630]  Elon Musk.
[02:57:19.827 --> 02:57:21.308]  He's basically already the president.
[02:57:21.488 --> 02:57:22.930]  No, he's going to be vital in the conversation.
[02:57:23.030 --> 02:57:26.393]  I just think that General Flynn becomes the inevitable leader.
[02:57:26.413 --> 02:57:27.714]  Oh, General Flynn, obviously, yeah, yeah.
[02:57:28.254 --> 02:57:29.936]  It's inevitable if they do that.
[02:57:30.376 --> 02:57:30.917]  So think about it.
[02:57:30.937 --> 02:57:33.419]  Trump's probably going to be better for them.
[02:57:33.439 --> 02:57:37.842]  Because if General Flynn... I mean, think about it.
[02:57:38.443 --> 02:57:44.688]  The people that General Flynn would bring in to the administration... The globalists are all going to be president.
[02:57:46.230 --> 02:57:46.630]  We'll see about that.
[02:57:49.386 --> 02:57:50.627]  Gunther in Tennessee.
[02:57:50.667 --> 02:57:51.648]  Thanks for calling, Gunther.
[02:57:51.668 --> 02:57:52.208]  Hey, Alex.
[02:57:52.409 --> 02:57:53.169]  First time caller.
[02:57:53.249 --> 02:57:55.091]  Real quick, wanted to plug your foundational energy.
[02:57:55.631 --> 02:57:56.612]  Just started taking that.
[02:57:57.272 --> 02:58:01.576]  And, boy, three pills, recommended dose, I was bouncing off the walls.
[02:58:01.696 --> 02:58:07.321]  But I tell you, foundational is the right name for that product because I'll cut down to one.
[02:58:07.341 --> 02:58:12.205]  It's like you have a baseline of energy that you were missing before that you got back.
[02:58:12.325 --> 02:58:12.405]  So,
[02:58:12.585 --> 02:58:20.846]  Well, I'm glad you mentioned that because it's methylfolate, the breakdown of folic acid, and a lot of people, particularly Europeans, don't absorb all of the folic acid.
[02:58:21.087 --> 02:58:22.187]  So it's not a stimulant.
[02:58:22.387 --> 02:58:25.807]  It's a totally natural thing that boosts energy that's foundational.
[02:58:26.087 --> 02:58:28.648]  And was I lying to you or did it not work?
[02:58:29.348 --> 02:58:30.548]  No, it was top-notch.
[02:58:30.588 --> 02:58:34.209]  And I was actually taking Red Pill Plus before, and that's got a little folic acid in it.
[02:58:34.269 --> 02:58:38.050]  I think there was a little buildup from this, but the energy from this was no jitters.
[02:58:38.230 --> 02:58:39.150]  I mean, it's top-notch.
[02:58:39.170 --> 02:58:39.970]  It's a great product.
[02:58:40.387 --> 02:58:41.348]  Well, thank you so much.
[02:58:41.388 --> 02:58:45.153]  Yeah, no, folic acid's great and it's in real red pill, but some can't break it down.
[02:58:45.193 --> 02:58:46.194]  This is the breakdown of it.
[02:58:46.274 --> 02:58:47.035]  That's exactly it.
[02:58:48.156 --> 02:58:48.957]  Winter is coming.
[02:58:49.618 --> 02:58:50.359]  Winter is coming.
[02:58:50.579 --> 02:58:51.700]  Winter is coming.
[02:58:52.061 --> 02:58:52.802]  Winter is coming.
[02:58:53.122 --> 02:58:54.203]  Winter is coming!
[02:58:55.245 --> 02:58:56.686]  Winter is coming.
[02:58:57.046 --> 02:58:58.447]  Winter isn't coming.
[02:58:59.028 --> 02:59:00.309]  Winter is here.

[02:59:49.616 --> 02:59:55.525]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:10.066 --> 03:00:12.868]  Welcome to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:12.888 --> 03:00:15.269]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:00:15.910 --> 03:00:23.074]  We've had a lot of coverage of the breaking events relating to Texas and all that, so I'm going to do something a little different.
[03:00:23.094 --> 03:00:34.061]  The last two Fridays, I covered the topic of how to destroy a nation, what the various psyops, subversion techniques and tricks there are to bring down countries.
[03:00:34.941 --> 03:00:39.104]  And one element that we haven't touched on in a good while is, once again, entertainment.
[03:00:39.827 --> 03:00:42.048]  I think we're good to go.
[03:01:01.061 --> 03:01:05.487]  But there was a huge interview that dropped also a couple weeks ago that went mega viral.
[03:01:06.007 --> 03:01:10.673]  And it's the Cat Williams, the stand-up comedian, his interview that he did on a podcast on YouTube.
[03:01:12.663 --> 03:01:13.163]  We're good to go.
[03:01:42.549 --> 03:01:43.170]  We're good to go.
[03:02:01.584 --> 03:02:02.004]  We're good to go.
[03:02:32.279 --> 03:02:40.783]  Williams noted, for example, in his interview that he had been invited to big Hollywood, quote, Illuminati parties and that certain deals were offered in May.
[03:02:40.843 --> 03:02:50.688]  Particularly, he mentions the case of Ludacris, the rapper, that he was invited to the same event and there was a $200 million deal offered and he decided that he would go his own way.
[03:02:50.768 --> 03:02:52.049]  This is his story.
[03:02:52.769 --> 03:02:53.790]  I think we're good to go.
[03:03:16.210 --> 03:03:16.330]  Yeah.
[03:03:42.271 --> 03:03:46.772]  This is going to tie into what we've seen in the last few weeks with the Taylor Swift drama.
[03:03:47.212 --> 03:03:50.633]  And again, it's not that Taylor Swift and football and all that nonsense even matters.
[03:03:51.133 --> 03:04:00.916]  What matters is the fact that it displays the propaganda and the mind control that the whole of entertainment, including things like professional sports, is a part of.
[03:04:01.756 --> 03:04:07.738]  If you think about the NFL, if you think about NBA, all the other leagues, they pretty much have gone woke
[03:04:08.519 --> 03:04:10.621]  Across the board, especially since 2016-2017.
[03:04:11.021 --> 03:04:28.915]  And it's only ramped up with, for example, the NFL, I think a couple years ago, putting out entirely pro-gay, and now it's moving even beyond that into other areas, pushing then that women and men's sports are not different, that men and women aren't different, that we can have this overlap.
[03:04:29.236 --> 03:04:33.379]  It's all going insane by design, and the ratings have tanked.
[03:04:33.985 --> 03:04:44.573]  And so this story, this big drama, this soap opera of Taylor Swift and her football player husband or boyfriend or whatever he is, that is all partially to bring ratings back.
[03:04:44.893 --> 03:04:46.735]  But there's a much more sinister agenda at work.
[03:04:47.195 --> 03:04:51.198]  It might even tie into psyops and intelligence operations.
[03:04:51.218 --> 03:04:52.299]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:04:52.319 --> 03:04:53.160]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[03:04:53.180 --> 03:04:54.541]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:04:58.354 --> 03:05:03.799]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[03:05:04.560 --> 03:05:08.844]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[03:05:09.245 --> 03:05:13.629]  We finally have a limited run back in supply at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:05:15.050 --> 03:05:17.791]  So many people have serious issues.
[03:05:18.091 --> 03:05:19.232]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[03:05:19.672 --> 03:05:25.074]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[03:05:25.614 --> 03:05:31.056]  Most of their iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[03:05:31.656 --> 03:05:34.957]  But this is pure atomic certified iodine.
[03:05:36.226 --> 03:05:36.626]  We're good to go.
[03:05:37.087 --> 03:05:38.027]  We're good to go.
[03:06:06.915 --> 03:06:25.783]  Yes, in this interview, Cat Williams breaks down his crazy experience of being invited to various Hollywood shindigs that included some sort of high-level deal that he wasn't willing to go along with.
[03:06:26.403 --> 03:06:35.607]  In that long interview that's had 60 or more million views, if you count all the other clips and whatnot, he goes into great detail about other...
[03:06:36.283 --> 03:06:37.103]  We're good to go.
[03:07:03.045 --> 03:07:07.768]  And to, you know, if need be, to destroy them, to leak the information when it's needed.
[03:07:07.808 --> 03:07:11.690]  So this is really a lot more common than we think.
[03:07:12.391 --> 03:07:17.634]  We think of this, again, as like a high-level political scandal, but it seems to be a lot more common.
[03:07:17.654 --> 03:07:30.042]  It's maybe not as efficient and sophisticated as the kinds of operations that Maxwell and Epstein and Henry Vinson and other people were running to blackmail people in other famous cases.
[03:07:30.682 --> 03:07:32.303]  Now, in the case of
[03:07:32.990 --> 03:07:33.390]  We're good to go.
[03:08:00.512 --> 03:08:00.872]  We're good to go.
[03:08:30.117 --> 03:08:33.339]  They put a lot of money and effort into helping her become a pop star.
[03:08:33.359 --> 03:08:36.422]  I'm not saying that she's not at all talented.
[03:08:37.242 --> 03:08:40.245]  I know maybe two Taylor Swift songs that I've even heard of.
[03:08:40.285 --> 03:08:42.186]  So I don't really know what her music is like.
[03:08:42.826 --> 03:08:43.987]  I'm not a huge fan of it.
[03:08:44.428 --> 03:08:48.230]  I'm not a 16-year-old girl, contrary to what I'm sure many of you thought.
[03:08:49.671 --> 03:08:52.734]  But her music does seem to tap into...
[03:08:53.601 --> 03:08:53.821]  I think?
[03:09:16.275 --> 03:09:39.126]  And so the Democrats have always done this, where they bring in the pop stars, and they're really just trying to coax the lowest IQ, lowest low-information voters out there to jump on board the cool party of, I guess, the trans-oppressed Olympics people known as the Democratic Party now.
[03:09:40.907 --> 03:09:45.369]  Basically, the demonic, satanic weapon that's now bringing down the entire country.
[03:09:46.147 --> 03:09:48.572]  Of course, the rhinos participate in that, for sure.
[03:09:49.374 --> 03:09:52.800]  But the Democratic Party just seems to be really just wild.
[03:09:53.461 --> 03:09:54.083]  They've just gone...
[03:09:54.887 --> 03:09:55.447]  Crazy.
[03:09:56.167 --> 03:10:00.469]  And obviously that's going to reflect when it comes to Hollywood and entertainment.
[03:10:00.889 --> 03:10:11.532]  And so I think that there's a ratings element to this with her helping the NFL and their tanking ratings post-woke coming back up, getting new generation of people into football.
[03:10:11.552 --> 03:10:12.832]  But it's no longer just football.
[03:10:12.932 --> 03:10:19.154]  It's also the drama of will Taylor Swift make it from her Japan concert flying back to the U.S.
[03:10:19.454 --> 03:10:20.394]  in time to have –
[03:10:21.354 --> 03:10:25.737]  You know, sex with him after the football party or whatever.
[03:10:26.017 --> 03:10:28.538]  I don't even know what's going on at the Super Bowl.
[03:10:28.858 --> 03:10:34.601]  Used to be, you know, the traditional conservative Illuminati Super Bowl party that we used to have, right?
[03:10:34.621 --> 03:10:40.064]  We used to have the traditional rite of all-seeing eyes and Lady Gaga.
[03:10:40.184 --> 03:10:42.625]  And now we've gone off into soap opera land.
[03:10:42.925 --> 03:10:46.247]  So I guess it's no longer good enough to have, you know,
[03:10:47.403 --> 03:10:49.305]  Masonic rituals at the Super Bowl.
[03:10:49.345 --> 03:10:58.378]  Now we've got to have a full-on soap opera with the biggest pop star in the world and her football player boyfriend or whatever he is.
[03:10:59.787 --> 03:11:00.467]  We're good to go.
[03:11:00.487 --> 03:11:00.648]  I think?
[03:11:27.942 --> 03:11:33.707]  Batting around the idea of what pop stars to recruit for disinformation operations.
[03:11:33.967 --> 03:11:40.892]  Now, they called it combating misinformation, but I'm going to translate that for you, which is disseminating misinformation.
[03:11:41.392 --> 03:11:45.776]  In other words, to bring in pop stars to control and steer the agenda.
[03:11:45.796 --> 03:11:49.238]  Now, there's nothing new for this idea.
[03:11:49.438 --> 03:11:51.620]  This is an old tactic.
[03:11:51.740 --> 03:11:52.701]  Elvis was used.
[03:11:53.524 --> 03:11:53.824]  I think so.
[03:12:09.628 --> 03:12:10.468]  For certain things.
[03:12:11.028 --> 03:12:14.210]  And again, there's a long history of government utilizing pop stars.
[03:12:14.270 --> 03:12:19.731]  Nixon deputized Elvis to fight the war on drugs, this kind of stuff.
[03:12:19.751 --> 03:12:22.892]  By the way, that was way more wholesome than what we see now, right?
[03:12:23.533 --> 03:12:26.654]  Now it's like, let's bring in Taylor Swift to promote the trans agenda, right?
[03:12:27.174 --> 03:12:30.675]  I mean, that's essentially what you have with the promotion of the Democratic Party.
[03:12:31.996 --> 03:12:33.156]  So this is all very...
[03:12:34.179 --> 03:12:37.241]  Intensely studied from a psychological warfare perspective.
[03:12:37.261 --> 03:12:40.683]  It doesn't mean that Taylor Swift is an asset or an agent.
[03:12:41.343 --> 03:12:43.244]  This was all over Twitter in the past few days.
[03:12:43.704 --> 03:12:47.886]  And of course, all the normies and all the libs are on Twitter saying, you're ridiculous.
[03:12:48.167 --> 03:12:51.268]  There's no way Taylor Swift is a CIA operative.
[03:12:51.348 --> 03:12:53.029]  Nobody said she was a CIA operative.
[03:12:54.430 --> 03:12:56.071]  So that's a straw man fallacy.
[03:12:56.903 --> 03:13:06.767]  What was said was that pop stars are often cajoled, used, manipulated, or even brainwashed into supporting these kinds of agendas.
[03:13:07.388 --> 03:13:09.248]  And it shouldn't seem far-fetched.
[03:13:09.308 --> 03:13:15.631]  I mean, think back to how many pop stars at various times have promoted things like the jab.
[03:13:16.252 --> 03:13:19.313]  There was a giant concert of multiple pop stars.
[03:13:19.353 --> 03:13:24.055]  I think J-Lo was there, Foo Fighters, pushing that you need to get the vaccine.
[03:13:24.747 --> 03:13:25.207]  We're good to go.
[03:13:44.031 --> 03:13:44.171]  Right.
[03:13:44.191 --> 03:13:44.331]  Right.
[03:14:12.942 --> 03:14:14.743]  And that's actually in the academic literature.
[03:14:14.763 --> 03:14:23.425]  You can read the, I think it's the Donald Baines book on Operation Hollywood where there's a whole section on the promotion of feminism through certain Hollywood movies.
[03:14:23.885 --> 03:14:30.067]  Not just feminism, obviously that's been there for a long time, but the idea that the women need to be on the front lines, which is ridiculous.
[03:14:31.454 --> 03:14:32.455]  It's not that women don't have
[03:14:50.391 --> 03:14:53.814]  You know, their own set of skills and techniques and capabilities.
[03:14:53.834 --> 03:14:57.916]  It's just that that's typically what men are better fitted to, obviously, right?
[03:14:58.497 --> 03:15:00.918]  Like having babies or something like that, right?
[03:15:03.040 --> 03:15:09.584]  Although I guess Arnold Schwarzenegger is also pretty good at having babies, if you ever watched Junior with him and Danny DeVito.
[03:15:10.064 --> 03:15:13.907]  Interesting way ahead of its time propaganda there, too, by the way.
[03:15:16.088 --> 03:15:19.811]  But back to the issue of psyops and pop stars.
[03:15:20.393 --> 03:15:22.796]  This has a long, long history.
[03:15:24.659 --> 03:15:28.762]  It doesn't require that every pop star be a trained agent of the CIA.
[03:15:29.023 --> 03:15:31.384]  It just means that they can be used by powerful forces.
[03:15:31.885 --> 03:15:45.296]  And in the next segment, we're going to go into the history of this, because a lot of people don't even know the history of sexpionage and pop stars and powerful people, entertainers being used in precisely this way, going back a long time.
[03:15:45.356 --> 03:15:49.219]  But we're going to focus on the last 100 or so, 120 years of this happening.
[03:15:50.200 --> 03:15:51.160]  This is the Alex Jones Show!
[03:15:51.180 --> 03:15:51.901]  We're good to go.
[03:15:54.850 --> 03:15:55.290]  Stay tuned.
[03:15:57.632 --> 03:16:00.535]  Have you tried taking the real red pill?

[03:16:11.684 --> 03:16:19.610]  Pregnenolone levels decrease with age, and low levels are associated with fatigue, low brain function, and unhealthy aging.
[03:16:19.830 --> 03:16:27.795]  The Real Red Pill Plus also provides essential trace minerals such as vitamin B12, calcium, copper, and zinc.

[03:17:24.402 --> 03:17:34.328]  Premium quality organic CBD, like Rebel Zen, has been shown to naturally reduce anxiety, relieve pain, and decrease inflammation.
[03:17:34.808 --> 03:17:42.433]  People have reported a reduction in symptoms of insomnia, arthritis, seizures, chronic pain, and epilepsy.
[03:17:42.913 --> 03:17:49.537]  Several studies have shown it helps to reduce cortisol, increase serotonin, and boost vitality.
[03:17:50.417 --> 03:18:00.762]  Order yours today at InfoWarsStore.com I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:18:00.782 --> 03:18:02.323]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:18:03.083 --> 03:18:06.144]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:18:07.025 --> 03:18:10.967]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers...
[03:18:12.386 --> 03:18:15.088]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:18:15.949 --> 03:18:23.774]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:18:24.755 --> 03:18:27.637]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:18:27.657 --> 03:18:33.342]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:18:34.182 --> 03:18:35.123]  I know you spread the word.
[03:18:35.143 --> 03:18:36.623]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[03:18:36.643 --> 03:18:37.184]  Keep doing it.
[03:18:37.224 --> 03:18:45.508]  But most viewers and listeners never go to Infowarsstore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[03:18:46.168 --> 03:18:49.810]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:18:50.470 --> 03:18:55.092]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowarsstore.com, our funding problems would be over.
[03:18:55.412 --> 03:18:56.193]  Please take action now.
[03:18:56.653 --> 03:19:00.375]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[03:19:00.715 --> 03:19:03.877]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[03:19:04.278 --> 03:19:08.740]  Because they can't get through this giant megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[03:19:09.381 --> 03:19:11.502]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[03:19:11.822 --> 03:19:19.787]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's You Will Eat the Bugs.
[03:19:20.427 --> 03:19:21.728]  This is The Great Awakening.
[03:19:22.248 --> 03:19:26.153]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second Great Renaissance.
[03:19:26.633 --> 03:19:30.157]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[03:19:30.418 --> 03:19:32.940]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.
[03:19:33.301 --> 03:19:37.005]  Get your copy of The Great Awakening today at InfoWars.com.
[03:19:37.025 --> 03:19:40.146]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:12.559 --> 03:20:13.479]  I'm back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:13.499 --> 03:20:15.540]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:20:15.560 --> 03:20:21.822]  We were talking about the history of sexpionage, hollow operations, honey traps, and so forth.
[03:20:21.902 --> 03:20:28.625]  At least that's what it's called when you get into the background of how these operations work to blackmail people.
[03:20:29.225 --> 03:20:30.525]  And there's nothing new here.
[03:20:30.585 --> 03:20:34.407]  In fact, there's a long history of actors, entertainers...
[03:20:35.248 --> 03:20:55.774]  Musicians, cabaret dancers, etc., who were cajoled into or perhaps recruited into, or maybe they even signed up out of patriotism or some other motivation that they thought was legitimate, to work for their government or some foreign government to engage in these kinds of operations.
[03:20:55.914 --> 03:21:02.256]  If you go back to, for example, the character at the time of World War I,
[03:21:03.620 --> 03:21:05.223]  You may have heard of the Mata Hari, right?
[03:21:05.263 --> 03:21:13.522]  She was a famous cabaret dancer, a Dutch exotic dancer, a courtesan convicted of being a spy for Germany during World War I.
[03:21:14.207 --> 03:21:19.712]  She was executed by a farming squad in France, and she was known kind of as the first femme fatale.
[03:21:20.032 --> 03:21:26.457]  Her job was to supposedly entrap and get dirt on powerful, famous people.
[03:21:26.977 --> 03:21:34.644]  It's debated as to how successful or prominent she really was in doing these operations, but she's one example amongst many.
[03:21:34.704 --> 03:21:39.768]  There is the case of the figure, if you may have heard of her, named Sonia Wiegert.
[03:21:40.048 --> 03:21:40.869]  She was basically...
[03:21:41.722 --> 03:21:43.702]  I think we're good to go.
[03:22:06.980 --> 03:22:07.220]  I think?
[03:22:23.917 --> 03:22:24.798]  It's a great movie.
[03:22:24.838 --> 03:22:28.881]  I recommend it because you'll notice that she was cajoled into this.
[03:22:28.921 --> 03:22:30.903]  They basically said, we have your father.
[03:22:31.403 --> 03:22:32.224]  He's under arrest.
[03:22:32.804 --> 03:22:37.028]  And unless you sleep with Nazi high command, we're not going to release your father.
[03:22:37.788 --> 03:22:39.149]  This ended up ruining her career.
[03:22:39.710 --> 03:22:46.295]  People thought that she was a traitor to her country and that she was just going to be sleeping around to get ahead or something like that.
[03:22:47.956 --> 03:22:52.500]  But in fact, no, she was actually cajoled into being a sex operative.
[03:22:56.034 --> 03:22:58.956]  There's also the case of Olga Chekova.
[03:22:59.317 --> 03:23:06.424]  She was the most famous actress from Russia in the circles of Hitler during the 1930s and 40s.
[03:23:06.464 --> 03:23:08.606]  She starred in about 100 different movies.
[03:23:09.907 --> 03:23:17.274]  And Olga Chekova was famously also spying, at least many people think, many historians think, spying for
[03:23:19.217 --> 03:23:21.458]  Stalin as an NKVD operative.
[03:23:21.478 --> 03:23:23.559]  But she was in some hundred films.
[03:23:23.599 --> 03:23:26.161]  She was in even films that Hitchcock made.
[03:23:26.201 --> 03:23:31.924]  So she was known, as many speculated, that she was kind of a Mata Hari of her day.
[03:23:34.085 --> 03:23:45.611]  Now in the case of other famous figures you might have heard of, there's the character of John Ford, one of the most famous directors back in the days of Westerns and John Wayne movies.
[03:23:46.818 --> 03:23:49.363]  I think John Ford won at least three.
[03:23:50.999 --> 03:23:51.739]  Academy Awards.
[03:23:51.839 --> 03:23:59.382]  One of those, I think, was for the Battle of Midway, which was actually an OSS-produced wartime production documentary.
[03:23:59.402 --> 03:24:01.723]  It was kind of propaganda at that time.
[03:24:01.783 --> 03:24:14.968]  So declassified documents from the CIA actually illuminate the really close relationship that John Ford had with the first director of the predecessor to the CIA, the OSS, namely Wild Bill Donovan.
[03:24:15.569 --> 03:24:16.349]  They were very close.
[03:24:16.369 --> 03:24:18.990]  They exchanged a lot of letters and information, a lot of contacts.
[03:24:20.931 --> 03:24:25.520]  As a lot of historians have now noted, it seems like the OSS actually helped.
[03:24:26.058 --> 03:24:29.879]  John Ford get quite a few of those awards that he got.
[03:24:30.299 --> 03:24:31.819]  I'm not saying he wasn't talented.
[03:24:32.340 --> 03:24:35.540]  Not saying that any of the stars and entertainers had no talent.
[03:24:35.920 --> 03:24:38.701]  Some of them have no talent and they're propelled to the top.
[03:24:38.741 --> 03:24:42.622]  At least that's one of the allegations that Cat Williams makes.
[03:24:43.262 --> 03:24:53.705]  And he argues that because they've gone along with certain compromise, with certain sexual actions and so forth, because they've allowed themselves to be filmed and compromised, they are propelled.
[03:24:55.161 --> 03:24:57.263]  Beyond their actual merit.
[03:24:58.284 --> 03:25:13.919]  But in the case of John Ford, I'm not saying he wasn't a good filmmaker or director, but it's interesting that he basically created this project called the Field Photographic Project, which was used by the OSS to film and to photograph people.
[03:25:14.918 --> 03:25:15.338]  I think so.
[03:25:30.979 --> 03:25:31.099]  Yeah.
[03:25:47.421 --> 03:25:50.302]  But he was also a film writer.
[03:25:50.642 --> 03:25:58.585]  In fact, he produced and I think he wrote the screenplay for a very famous Roman Catholic film, Flowers of St.
[03:25:58.645 --> 03:26:01.486]  Francis, which was very popular back, I think, in the 50s.
[03:26:02.046 --> 03:26:04.407]  So again, this is nothing new.
[03:26:04.467 --> 03:26:05.727]  This is pretty common.
[03:26:06.828 --> 03:26:09.429]  People who were in the OSS, I think there's a guy named Wierlert.
[03:26:09.889 --> 03:26:14.710]  He also worked with Donovan and then went back to Hollywood and worked with people like...
[03:26:17.151 --> 03:26:17.952]  Like John Ford.
[03:26:37.885 --> 03:26:38.606]  We're good to go.
[03:27:04.682 --> 03:27:05.223]  I think we're good to go.
[03:27:22.453 --> 03:27:23.294]  Those kinds of operations.
[03:27:23.334 --> 03:27:29.016]  But in the recent interviews, Copeland talks about his history in the music industry.
[03:27:29.417 --> 03:27:35.259]  And he pioneered certain genres that kind of popped up in the 80s.
[03:27:36.120 --> 03:27:40.482]  He was, of course, related to Stuart Copeland from the police.
[03:27:41.282 --> 03:27:45.684]  I think Miles was the manager for the police for some time.
[03:27:46.405 --> 03:27:50.667]  And then other famous acts that he was involved with, like Fine Young Cannibals and
[03:27:51.447 --> 03:27:52.567]  We're good to go.
[03:27:52.727 --> 03:27:53.007]  I think?
[03:28:20.223 --> 03:28:21.925]  In the punk scene, too.
[03:28:21.945 --> 03:28:23.346]  Yeah, I forgot about the punk scene.
[03:28:23.566 --> 03:28:26.609]  Miles was closely involved in the punk scene.
[03:28:27.870 --> 03:28:37.619]  If you read Miles' book, he says that if you really want to understand the long-term goal of all these CIA operations in all these other countries, he says just read Bertrand Russell and the Council on Foreign Relations.
[03:28:39.221 --> 03:28:42.163]  And he says you'll understand that the long-term goal is to depopulate.
[03:28:42.183 --> 03:28:44.726]  So that's the whole thing.
[03:28:46.354 --> 03:28:50.061]  So, there's all these operations, but the long-term goal is really to just populate.
[03:28:50.101 --> 03:28:53.507]  Now, when we come back, we're going to talk more about FEMA, the guards, and the spies.
[03:28:53.527 --> 03:28:54.650]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:54.670 --> 03:28:56.273]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Nozzles.
[03:28:56.946 --> 03:29:01.570]  29 years on air, all I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalists.
[03:29:02.271 --> 03:29:07.595]  And I've done the best job I can to tell those words that have been accurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[03:29:07.995 --> 03:29:14.420]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves, unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people.
[03:29:14.661 --> 03:29:15.341]  We don't do that.
[03:29:15.822 --> 03:29:17.703]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[03:29:18.083 --> 03:29:20.105]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product.
[03:29:20.145 --> 03:29:20.726]  It's so powerful.
[03:29:21.646 --> 03:29:31.694]  This is the breakdown product after your cells process it of folic acid, methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[03:29:32.154 --> 03:29:33.415]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[03:29:33.435 --> 03:29:34.276]  It's not a stimulant.
[03:29:34.536 --> 03:29:36.358]  It energizes your cells.
[03:29:36.918 --> 03:29:41.761]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the globalist agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[03:30:04.967 --> 03:30:17.932]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections, masquerading as vaccines.
[03:30:18.832 --> 03:30:23.013]  It is so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives oblivious.
[03:30:23.254 --> 03:30:27.095]  And you realize ignorance is not bliss, it equals death.
[03:30:28.732 --> 03:30:49.157]  But people are starting to really understand how serious things are, and that's a hard thing to do, because to wake up to a disturbing reality and realize that we're in the middle of a giant biological weapons war against humanity, and that there's mass sterilization that's already taking place, cutting off all the major energy sources, is really hard to deal with, but it's the reality.
[03:30:49.717 --> 03:30:53.898]  Facing it is our only chance to turn this around, because stuff's about to get really, really nasty.
[03:30:54.298 --> 03:30:54.938]  Infowars.com.
[03:30:57.139 --> 03:31:01.420]  The InfoWars Live Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has finally returned.

[03:32:58.283 --> 03:33:04.188]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:17.356 --> 03:33:26.566]  We're talking about the history of sexual blackmail, sexpionage, as it's called, in the entertainment industry.
[03:33:26.586 --> 03:33:27.967]  It has a long track record.
[03:33:28.588 --> 03:33:39.820]  And part of the reason for that is that it overlaps with the history of many famous celebrities and entertainers who were recruited into espionage and spy work.
[03:33:40.504 --> 03:33:41.565]  I think that this is very well known.
[03:34:00.402 --> 03:34:14.529]  In fact, as time goes by, more and more biographies are written, more and more things are declassified, and we learn more about the close relationship between various government agencies in Hollywood, which is a lot closer than people think.
[03:34:14.549 --> 03:34:22.753]  In fact, if you go to my Twitter, I have the clip up from the old Ben Affleck interview from a few years ago at either the Telegraph or the Guardian.
[03:34:22.773 --> 03:34:29.737]  I don't remember which entity it was, but he's talking about the movie Argo, which of course he won an Academy Award for.
[03:34:30.763 --> 03:34:43.733]  And if you remember, the plot of Argo is that the CIA is using a cutout Hollywood studio and a movie as a cover for one of their operations to extract people during the Iran hostage situation.
[03:34:44.374 --> 03:34:56.563]  And so, at least as far as we are told, there's some truth, basically, loosely speaking, to this Argo event where they created a fake science fiction movie for a CIA operation.
[03:34:57.184 --> 03:34:58.865]  And in the course of many interviews,
[03:34:59.451 --> 03:34:59.871]  I think so.
[03:35:22.953 --> 03:35:26.878]  Went from the show Alias to then working for doing PR.
[03:35:27.038 --> 03:35:27.899]  There's the interview right there.
[03:35:27.919 --> 03:35:28.720]  I don't know if you guys have it.
[03:35:28.740 --> 03:35:33.425]  If you want to play that section where he talks about it, if you have it ready there.
[03:35:35.988 --> 03:35:38.831]  If not, you can go find it on my Twitter.
[03:35:38.851 --> 03:35:39.752]  Go ahead.
[03:35:43.840 --> 03:35:48.781]  Yeah, you'll notice on my Twitter, I've got it set right there to where he talks about it.
[03:35:49.441 --> 03:36:04.465]  In that video, he says that he almost sounds like he was a little surprised, but then we find out, wait a minute, Jennifer Garner goes from the show Alias, which was directly consulted on by the CIA for many years, the J.J.
[03:36:04.505 --> 03:36:13.227]  Abrams spy show, and then she does basically PR work for the CIA, where she pushed a lot of recruitment stuff and did a lot of videos and
[03:36:13.907 --> 03:36:17.370]  And at least at a PR level was doing that kind of stuff.
[03:36:17.410 --> 03:36:23.275]  Now, in my view, though, actually some people have been working for agencies.
[03:36:23.355 --> 03:36:28.620]  We know people like Arnon Milcon worked, I think, for Massad Connections in Hollywood.
[03:36:29.300 --> 03:36:30.261]  We know that people like
[03:36:31.429 --> 03:36:35.972]  George Clooney has worked very closely with CIA-connected things.
[03:36:36.012 --> 03:36:41.635]  And then we have people like Angelina Jolie, who didn't just train under a CIA handler for many years.
[03:36:41.976 --> 03:36:45.778]  Melissa Maley, she actually became a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[03:36:46.318 --> 03:36:49.140]  And some Hollywood people actually seem to do that as well.
[03:36:49.947 --> 03:36:50.467]  We're good to go.
[03:37:11.520 --> 03:37:24.408]  In fact, if you don't know, Wonderland Studios, which was the famous Air Force cutting-edge studio in the 1950s and 60s, that studio was actually used by Walt Disney.
[03:37:24.828 --> 03:37:26.989]  It was used by Marilyn Monroe, Jimmy Stewart.
[03:37:27.029 --> 03:37:33.493]  All the top Hollywood people had access to this famous studio up in Wonderland.
[03:37:33.533 --> 03:37:35.654]  It's up in the Hollywood Hills.
[03:37:37.697 --> 03:37:41.420]  You have to drive up Mulholland Drive to get there, which is an interesting road in history there.
[03:37:41.480 --> 03:37:46.563]  But again, this is the most famous cutting-edge studio.
[03:37:46.583 --> 03:38:00.993]  In fact, you can go on YouTube and watch Jimmy Stewart being filmed at Wonderland Studios, the Air Force studio there, doing a lot of promos, doing a lot of FBI stuff, because he was actually working with the FBI.
[03:38:01.493 --> 03:38:05.616]  So maybe we can play this clip here, and you'll get an idea of what Ben Affleck's talking about.
[03:38:09.568 --> 03:38:12.169]  Actors in Hollywood who also moonlight as agents, do you think?
[03:38:12.189 --> 03:38:13.830]  I think there are probably quite a few, yes.
[03:38:13.910 --> 03:38:17.672]  I think probably Hollywood is full of CIA agents, and we just don't know it.
[03:38:18.492 --> 03:38:21.973]  And I wouldn't be surprised at all to discover that, you know, this was extremely common.
[03:38:22.474 --> 03:38:23.354]  Are you a CIA agent?
[03:38:23.594 --> 03:38:24.214]  I am, yes.
[03:38:24.475 --> 03:38:27.416]  And now you've blown my cover, so there goes my career.
[03:38:28.096 --> 03:38:30.037]  I just hope the directing thing better work out.
[03:38:32.498 --> 03:38:38.981]  Now, of course, he says all he's joking, but again, there's a long history to famous actors and actresses
[03:38:40.169 --> 03:38:49.615]  Being in the CIA, we mentioned a couple lesser-known foreign people, but people don't know that, for example, Houdini worked for a time doing spy work.
[03:38:50.136 --> 03:38:51.917]  Jimmy Stewart worked directly with the FBI.
[03:38:52.137 --> 03:38:55.899]  In fact, he's part of a movie promoting the FBI called The FBI Story.
[03:38:56.440 --> 03:39:05.746]  If you watch the Wonderland Studios videos you can find on YouTube, you can see him filming a lot of the propaganda pieces for the FBI.
[03:39:06.146 --> 03:39:07.767]  Julia Child, the famous TV cook,
[03:39:08.445 --> 03:39:09.506]  I think we're good to go.
[03:39:09.526 --> 03:39:11.327]  I think we're good to go.
[03:39:11.347 --> 03:39:12.887]  I think we're good to go.
[03:39:36.324 --> 03:39:38.485]  Director Billy Wilder worked closely with C.D.
[03:39:38.525 --> 03:39:43.588]  Jackson, who also worked in a lot of Hollywood productions.
[03:39:44.028 --> 03:39:44.248]  C.D.
[03:39:44.288 --> 03:39:50.031]  Jackson, of course, is the father of the doctrinal warfare program, the CIA's plan to utilize religion.
[03:39:50.431 --> 03:39:51.712]  We all know about Ian Fleming.
[03:39:51.772 --> 03:39:53.213]  I've talked about that for many years.
[03:39:53.313 --> 03:40:00.136]  I did grad work on the history of Ian Fleming and using James Bond as an icon on a property.
[03:40:00.909 --> 03:40:01.729]  During the Cold War.
[03:40:01.829 --> 03:40:03.390]  I wrote two books that cover this.
[03:40:03.450 --> 03:40:08.651]  If you want, you can go to my website and get signed copies of Esoteric Hollywood 1 and 2 in the shop.
[03:40:08.711 --> 03:40:12.632]  If you find this topic interesting, you can see the shop there at the top left.
[03:40:13.252 --> 03:40:15.753]  And if you get my books, you do get signed copies.
[03:40:16.373 --> 03:40:29.976]  Noel Coward, the famous, again, in the circles of Ian Fleming, he was very close to Walt Disney, a British intelligence operative who helped set up the OSS with people like William Stevenson and Ian Fleming.
[03:40:30.771 --> 03:40:32.033]  The predecessor of the CIA.
[03:40:32.474 --> 03:40:35.037]  Walt Disney worked very closely with the CIA and the FBI.
[03:40:35.057 --> 03:40:41.247]  In fact, the CIA is who procured the land for the Florida Disney operation.
[03:40:42.273 --> 03:40:45.574]  Frank Sinatra worked closely with the FBI and organized crime.
[03:40:46.315 --> 03:40:54.538]  Audrey Hepburn helped out to inform for the UN and for anti-fascist operations.
[03:40:54.778 --> 03:40:58.100]  Marlene Dietrich offered to spy for the OSS.
[03:40:58.120 --> 03:41:05.043]  She was also suspected of being a Nazi spy for many years by the FBI, but actually it turns out she was trying to spy for the OSS.
[03:41:07.027 --> 03:41:09.188]  Again, there are many, many, many instances of this.
[03:41:09.268 --> 03:41:10.069]  It's a long history.
[03:41:10.109 --> 03:41:11.189]  It's a fascinating tale.
[03:41:12.390 --> 03:41:17.912]  Few people know about this, but I can't forget Christopher Lee.
[03:41:17.952 --> 03:41:22.895]  Christopher Lee was a royal, I think RAF, RAF assassin.
[03:41:23.215 --> 03:41:28.817]  So he actually has quite a bit of history, not just in espionage, but actually in assassinating people.
[03:41:29.077 --> 03:41:30.838]  And he talked about this in interviews.
[03:41:30.898 --> 03:41:34.900]  It eventually came out that he was involved in this kind of stuff, but
[03:41:36.551 --> 03:41:36.831]  The OSS.
[03:42:06.699 --> 03:42:12.865]  And Cary Grant plays an allied spy who is tasked with seducing Ingrid Bergman.
[03:42:14.006 --> 03:42:21.114]  And the belief is that Ingrid Bergman then could inform on James Mason, who is a Nazi sympathizer.
[03:42:21.514 --> 03:42:30.423]  But Cary Grant uses his seduction techniques as a male seducer to basically bring Ingrid Bergman under his thumb
[03:42:32.144 --> 03:42:36.207]  And so this stuff is even in the movies, which is ironic, right?
[03:42:36.227 --> 03:42:44.272]  We think about all kinds of cases of Chuck Berris and people who are rumored to have worked for the CIA as well.
[03:42:44.292 --> 03:42:46.473]  Of course, he claims that that wasn't the case.
[03:42:47.073 --> 03:42:50.776]  But isn't it interesting that George Clooney made the movie about Chuck Berris?
[03:42:50.816 --> 03:42:54.418]  This is the Alex Jones Show, and I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:42:57.560 --> 03:43:00.101]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalist.
[03:43:00.482 --> 03:43:02.843]  And people can't identify who's a patriot and who isn't.
[03:43:03.163 --> 03:43:06.305]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalist.
[03:43:06.365 --> 03:43:09.267]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.
[03:43:09.527 --> 03:43:20.093]  That's why I designed this amazing 1776 red, white, and blue Gadsden flag shirt so you can support the InfoWar and meet like-minded people everywhere when you wear it.
[03:43:20.213 --> 03:43:25.836]  When you wear these shirts, it creates an amazing amount of energy and it's quite the adventure.

[03:43:58.639 --> 03:44:05.681]  The ultimate turmeric product on the market has returned to InfoWarsStore.com and is now 25% off for a limited time.
[03:44:06.041 --> 03:44:11.042]  Utilized for thousands of years, turmeric is one of the most studied medicinal herbs today.
[03:44:11.422 --> 03:44:19.064]  Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles are published every year on the chemistry and therapeutic potential of turmeric and its active components.
[03:44:19.384 --> 03:44:29.910]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body, help boost and support flexibility, increase mobility, assist in joint function, bolster your immune system, and so much more.
[03:44:30.270 --> 03:44:42.036]  Regular turmeric from the store contains about 1-5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids, but our super powerful extract using bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients in turmeric.
[03:44:42.276 --> 03:44:45.498]  No other product can compare with this cumanoid delivery system.
[03:44:45.758 --> 03:44:49.380]  So if you want to put the true power of turmeric to the test, then look no further.
[03:44:49.601 --> 03:44:55.925]  Grab yourself a bottle today for 25% off at InfoWarsStore.com and put your body at ease.
[03:44:56.845 --> 03:45:00.367]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[03:45:00.748 --> 03:45:07.732]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[03:45:07.952 --> 03:45:09.954]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[03:45:10.114 --> 03:45:11.175]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[03:45:11.215 --> 03:45:11.956]  He loved the idea.
[03:45:12.256 --> 03:45:15.779]  What would you call the debate and discussion about a pro-human future?
[03:45:15.799 --> 03:45:16.680]  Just Team Humanity?

[03:45:44.722 --> 03:45:45.703]  We're told we're killing the Earth.
[03:45:46.003 --> 03:45:50.265]  We're told all this garbage so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[03:45:50.565 --> 03:45:51.266]  We're not going to do that.
[03:45:51.526 --> 03:45:56.169]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you all for your support.

[03:46:58.691 --> 03:47:04.574]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:13.001 --> 03:47:14.086]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:14.106 --> 03:47:15.854]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:47:16.155 --> 03:47:16.758]  We're talking about
[03:47:18.137 --> 03:47:18.917]  We're good to go.
[03:47:46.742 --> 03:47:55.404]  People all over Twitter in the past couple weeks have just been losing their mind over this idea that pop stars might be functioning in that role.
[03:47:56.184 --> 03:48:09.007]  Well, if you think about, for example, famous dancer and singer Josephine Baker, did you know that she was involved in spying and espionage work to inform on Nazis?
[03:48:09.888 --> 03:48:16.029]  They recruited Moe Berg, the famous catcher, to work for the OSS and do spy work
[03:48:16.803 --> 03:48:17.003]  I think?
[03:48:35.908 --> 03:48:36.008]  Yeah.
[03:48:55.763 --> 03:48:57.304]  Is it A Dangerous Mind?
[03:48:57.384 --> 03:49:00.766]  I think the Clooney movie about Chuck Beres.
[03:49:00.786 --> 03:49:09.190]  And again, the story of Chuck Beres, the TV host, the gong show guy, being recruited to work for the CIA and to even do assassin work.
[03:49:09.230 --> 03:49:12.812]  I mean, that's kind of a far-fetched tale if you watch the movie.
[03:49:12.872 --> 03:49:16.574]  And of course, it's still disputed and debated as to whether it was the case.
[03:49:16.654 --> 03:49:19.856]  But, you know, it's actually insightful in this regard because
[03:49:20.758 --> 03:49:30.599]  When George Clooney, I think he plays the handler, the recruiter, when he tries to recruit Chuck Beres in the story, he propositions him with things like patriotism.
[03:49:31.432 --> 03:49:32.753]  Don't you want to support your country?
[03:49:33.174 --> 03:49:44.582]  And I think in a lot of cases, at the time of World War II or during the Cold War, people like Jimmy Stewart, who seems, as Hollywood goes, to have basically hardly any scandals.
[03:49:45.483 --> 03:49:52.829]  In fact, they tried to force him to go to prostitution houses because he was so famously not scandalous.
[03:49:53.349 --> 03:49:55.471]  And in fact, Jimmy Stewart was...
[03:49:56.885 --> 03:50:02.750]  Yeah, there's the scene right there where George Clooney is recruiting Sam Rockwell, who's doing the Chuck Beres story, right?
[03:50:25.462 --> 03:50:40.190]  And if you don't know, that story is about how Chuck Beres was a TV host and he was doing a lot of TV work, but under the cover of his travels and so forth, he was actually doing CIA work and was supposedly even assassinating people.
[03:50:40.230 --> 03:50:42.331]  Now, again, that's not super far-fetched.
[03:50:43.071 --> 03:50:55.997]  If we think about somebody like Christopher Lee, and I'm not alleging that Christopher Lee was assassinating people while he was an actor, but he talks about being an assassin, or it's at least come out that he most likely was doing that.
[03:50:56.057 --> 03:51:00.038]  We know he was in the Royal RAS, I think.
[03:51:01.559 --> 03:51:02.760]  Oh, the RAF, excuse me.
[03:51:04.500 --> 03:51:08.304]  So, again, a lot of this is, as we said, mainline history.
[03:51:08.364 --> 03:51:09.626]  So it's not speculation.
[03:51:10.006 --> 03:51:18.475]  The Washington Post has a pretty long, extensive write-up on the famous people that I've mentioned and their spy work.
[03:51:18.835 --> 03:51:21.918]  So even mainstream media and news can report about this.
[03:51:22.099 --> 03:51:23.480]  CBSAS, thank you very much.
[03:51:23.520 --> 03:51:25.062]  I got it backwards as to which.
[03:51:26.104 --> 03:51:26.764]  We're good to go.
[03:51:55.780 --> 03:52:00.262]  And the director and everybody would say, oh, you need to scream when this happens.
[03:52:00.963 --> 03:52:04.864]  And Christopher Lee says, well, of course you don't scream when you're stabbed.
[03:52:05.425 --> 03:52:07.926]  And everybody says, what do you mean you don't scream when you're stabbed?
[03:52:08.646 --> 03:52:10.487]  And he says, no, trust me, I know.
[03:52:10.547 --> 03:52:14.129]  When you're stabbed in the back, you gasp for air because it pierces your lung.
[03:52:15.009 --> 03:52:16.470]  And everybody says, well, how do you know that?
[03:52:17.023 --> 03:52:17.804]  Yeah, that's it right there.
[03:52:17.844 --> 03:52:19.425]  Peter Jackson is talking about it.
[03:52:20.106 --> 03:52:24.671]  And Christopher Lee basically implies, well, I know because I've done this before.
[03:52:25.872 --> 03:52:27.914]  I know what happens when you stab somebody in the back because
[03:52:28.914 --> 03:52:30.855]  I was a British assassin, right?
[03:52:30.895 --> 03:52:34.036]  So he was like legit James Bond stuff, right?
[03:52:35.177 --> 03:52:36.818]  I think that seems to be the case.
[03:52:36.898 --> 03:52:42.420]  And multiple mainstream publications have reported on this in regard to Christopher Lee.
[03:52:42.860 --> 03:52:44.041]  But again, this is nothing new.
[03:52:44.401 --> 03:52:50.784]  This is long history in Hollywood of these close connections and these close operations.
[03:52:51.620 --> 03:52:52.761]  I think we're good to go.
[03:53:15.209 --> 03:53:16.189]  And the book is great.
[03:53:16.209 --> 03:53:16.789]  It's fascinating.
[03:53:16.809 --> 03:53:25.691]  But it also makes a lot of connections with other actors and TV people that you might not know about or haven't heard about or they were forgotten TV stars in the 1970s.
[03:53:26.171 --> 03:53:27.552]  Many of them worked with the CIA.
[03:53:27.612 --> 03:53:40.135]  And, of course, if you think about the music industry, the music scene, Dave McGowan has a book, Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon, about the whole history of the Laurel Canyon movement, the scene.
[03:53:40.175 --> 03:53:42.095]  That was actually the – yeah, there's the chaos book.
[03:53:42.705 --> 03:53:44.506]  Manson, the CIA and the Secret History of the 60s.
[03:53:44.546 --> 03:53:48.989]  And he goes through a lot of TV stars, connected organized crime into the CIA.
[03:53:49.049 --> 03:53:52.270]  And some of the TV stars even worked for the CIA in the first few chapters, for example.
[03:53:52.971 --> 03:54:02.336]  But McGowan's book goes into the history of the music scene in Laurel Canyon, which is really, again, this is where Wonderland Studios is, the Air Force studio that I mentioned earlier.
[03:54:02.996 --> 03:54:08.019]  By the 1960s, Laurel Canyon becomes kind of the hotbed of the burgeoning hippie scene.
[03:54:08.640 --> 03:54:10.881]  And so prior to the Haight-Ashbury district of
[03:54:11.841 --> 03:54:11.961]  Yeah.
[03:54:31.328 --> 03:54:31.888]  The Laurel Canyon Scene
[03:54:59.594 --> 03:55:07.944]  And we find out about the Mamas and the Papas, we find out about the Doors, we find out about all these people who have really high-level military and deep state connections.
[03:55:08.725 --> 03:55:13.490]  This goes pretty much throughout all the characters that you've heard about, the famous people from the 1960s.
[03:55:13.590 --> 03:55:20.218]  I'm not saying that everybody in the 1960s counterculture movement was an agent, but we do know that bands like the Grateful Dead...
[03:55:21.010 --> 03:55:21.551]  We're good to go.
[03:55:41.710 --> 03:55:46.131]  That means that not the whole thing or that all the counterculture is false or bad.
[03:55:46.231 --> 03:55:58.114]  It means that when you have a counterculture movement that perhaps is organic, that is anti-war against the Vietnam War, etc., what happens is that this establishment, the system says, okay, how can we co-opt that?
[03:55:58.974 --> 03:56:07.376]  And then you get basically the drug culture, the hedonistic element of it, it becomes the focus rather than the legitimate activism.
[03:56:07.416 --> 03:56:09.397]  Because even at that time you have people questioning the
[03:56:10.146 --> 03:56:11.588]  We're good to go.
[03:56:23.078 --> 03:56:24.680]  Then how do you get rid of that opposition?
[03:56:24.720 --> 03:56:36.170]  Oh, let's take that whole counterculture and let's turn it into being about sex, drugs, and rock and roll, turn it into a hedonistic thing, and that really dispels the legitimate opposition and activism in those groups.
[03:56:36.190 --> 03:56:49.322]  And that's the thesis of the book, is that really the 1960s counterculture really becomes a culture-toxifying thing to get all the boomers basically addicted to various drugs and ruining people's lives.
[03:56:50.203 --> 03:56:50.783]  We're good to go.
[03:57:17.060 --> 03:57:26.405]  Of the Fortune 100, Fortune 500, that there's no legitimate counterculture, because the arts and counterculture could be really powerful and really legitimate.
[03:57:26.745 --> 03:57:30.608]  That's why it has to be so tightly controlled, managed, and steered.
[03:57:31.148 --> 03:57:38.312]  And of course, the CIA, their Congress for Cultural Freedom out of the Cold War, was one of the key means by which they controlled this movement.
