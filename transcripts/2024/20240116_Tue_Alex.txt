[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.101]  It's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:16.002]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:00:16.062 --> 00:00:23.483]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.478 --> 00:00:47.763]  You're about to see one of the most viral reports I've ever released in 30 years on air.
[00:00:48.223 --> 00:00:50.145]  But more importantly, one of the most censored.
[00:00:51.147 --> 00:00:56.850]  Going back a few years ago, before Elon Musk bought Twitter, it would get 10 million views on a routine basis, but be pulled down.
[00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.893]  Not because it was disinformation, but because it was so accurate from the globalist-owned documents.
[00:01:03.534 --> 00:01:09.116]  That's how I was able to make these predictions that then came true exactly as I said they would.
[00:01:09.557 --> 00:01:13.599]  Not because I had a crystal ball, but because I had their own battle plan.
[00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.721]  So watch the clip and then realize every day at 11 a.m.
[00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:23.104]  Central at InfoWars.com forward slash show and right here on X, I'm telling you what's coming next.
[00:01:23.964 --> 00:01:25.084]  InfoWars.com.
[00:01:25.465 --> 00:01:26.765]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:33.429]  So from the InfoWars vault, here's what's been previously censored now available because of Elon Musk freeing X.
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.181]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:38.163]  There is a war on for your mind.
[00:01:38.703 --> 00:01:41.825]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful.
[00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:45.888]  And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute.
[00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:50.112]  Because I've had chills since last night.
[00:01:51.593 --> 00:01:54.355]  This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:07.525]  A Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family, everything that's in the other documents.
[00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:13.649]  But this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you and force vaccines.
[00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:20.233]  The hell we're already living in that's just going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[00:02:20.393 --> 00:02:22.975]  But that story is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:02:23.135 --> 00:02:26.417]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[00:02:26.477 --> 00:02:29.679]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:39.826]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers, so many of them, that they're producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast.
[00:02:40.266 --> 00:02:41.887]  That you could never read them all.
[00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:45.187]  It is an open conspiracy against you and your family.
[00:02:45.688 --> 00:03:02.633]  I pray to God, I pray to my Heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength and the will to be able to face this horror and to give me the strength to carry on because I know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information and just want to comment on the YouTube videos or on message boards that I'm a liar.
[00:03:04.573 --> 00:03:04.973]  I know why.
[00:03:05.553 --> 00:03:06.594]  Because it's scary.
[00:03:11.127 --> 00:03:13.049]  You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:17.834]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[00:03:17.854 --> 00:03:22.358]  You're not going to be able to just, you know, go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:33.189]  The only chance we've got of beating this scientific dictatorship, this creeping death that takes its time to incrementally enslave you,
[00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.671]  Mentally, psychologically, physically, spiritually.
[00:03:37.491 --> 00:03:46.793]  The only way to defeat it is for the rank and file of this planet to realize that you have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be.
[00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:53.434]  Once you face this information, once you've consciously admitted it to yourself, it will take over your life.
[00:03:53.854 --> 00:03:55.194]  It should take over your life.
[00:03:55.674 --> 00:03:56.735]  I mean, what else?
[00:03:57.375 --> 00:03:58.215]  What else could it do?
[00:04:00.632 --> 00:04:11.019]  We've got to get past the artificial stigma that the controlled corporate media has been putting out for decades, ahead of their opening of unveiling of planetary dictatorship.
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.042]  They all talk about how we need a police state to carry this out.
[00:04:16.102 --> 00:04:23.747]  Canada and the United States are going to work in lockstep to display the seriousness of our commitment at both home and abroad.
[00:04:23.827 --> 00:04:27.109]  Win, lose, or draw, you need to choose a side.
[00:04:28.991 --> 00:04:29.732]  InfoWars.
[00:04:30.112 --> 00:04:31.693]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:04:31.713 --> 00:04:37.996]  All other networks lie to you about what's happening now.
[00:04:38.357 --> 00:04:40.958]  InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:04:41.438 --> 00:04:45.761]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[00:04:51.264 --> 00:04:52.885]  It's Tuesday, January 16, 2024.
[00:04:53.445 --> 00:04:55.767]  We're back in 60 seconds.
[00:04:55.807 --> 00:04:56.227]  Get ready.
[00:04:57.027 --> 00:04:58.068]  This is the biggest news ever.
[00:05:01.584 --> 00:05:05.707]  You know, I stood up here and I yelled and screamed about the New World Order and the globalists.
[00:05:05.727 --> 00:05:10.910]  They're planning to get rid of the borders and release a virus and have a global power grab and you saw it all come true.
[00:05:12.031 --> 00:05:12.751]  But there's a...
[00:05:13.917 --> 00:05:14.698]  Inverse of that.
[00:05:15.438 --> 00:05:20.422]  There's not just the bad stuff I'm telling you about, there's the good stuff I'm telling you about.
[00:05:21.182 --> 00:05:25.826]  And just like our information is the best you're going to find out there, our supplements are amazing.
[00:05:26.466 --> 00:05:30.229]  So our new special in the last half of January 2024 is here.
[00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:35.092]  It's Real Red Pill Plus and DNA Force Plus, both 50% off.
[00:05:35.253 --> 00:05:38.335]  We're calling it the Supercharged Special.
[00:05:38.995 --> 00:05:44.818]  You can get either one of these great items at 40% off individually or together for 50% off.
[00:05:45.118 --> 00:05:49.020]  Now, in the time we have left, I can't tell you why they're so great and what they do for your body.
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.162]  Go to InfoWarstore.com, look at the ingredients and investigate it, and then get them.
[00:05:54.443 --> 00:05:56.964]  It supports the InfoWar and it'll change your life.
[00:05:57.544 --> 00:05:58.304]  Take advantage now.
[00:05:58.484 --> 00:05:59.245]  InfoWarstore.com.
[00:06:07.248 --> 00:06:21.672]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:22.092 --> 00:06:33.456]  I am sitting here at 1106 and 16 seconds, staring into these cameras in a studio in Central Texas, and looking at an image from a satellite of our planet.
[00:06:34.997 --> 00:06:39.361]  We're 293 days, 12 hours, 53 minutes from the most important election in world history.
[00:06:39.801 --> 00:06:50.129]  An election that's about peace and prosperity and justice and sovereignty versus world war, bio-attacks, nuclear Armageddon.
[00:06:52.031 --> 00:06:58.976]  And I was just in there at a computer terminal about seven, eight minutes ago writing the headline for the show.
[00:07:01.058 --> 00:07:02.419]  And I can usually do it pretty quick.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.901]  Because every day we put a new headline out and then a link to the live show at Infowars.com for its live show.
[00:07:06.921 --> 00:07:18.265]  And I sat there for about three or four minutes and I couldn't come up with a headline alarmist enough for what's going on.
[00:07:19.666 --> 00:07:28.929]  Obviously people are tuning in to hear about the Iowa sweep and Trump getting all the counties and the whole state being red and what that means.
[00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:31.830]  And of course,
[00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:41.625]  The race war response from the Democratic Party and their talking point by Joy Reid and Mr. Matt Allen, all the rest of them.
[00:07:43.667 --> 00:07:46.669]  And it shows how they're trying to set up a race war and civil war.
[00:07:46.689 --> 00:07:51.833]  And they even say that on their newscast to claim that Trump has to have his military power taken away.
[00:07:51.853 --> 00:07:58.239]  So they're already moving on to that point, behaving like they think he really will defeat their attempts at fraud again.
[00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:07.573]  But in the news, in the Russian news, the Chinese news, the British news, and the U.S.
[00:08:07.593 --> 00:08:13.477]  defense news, there are all these documents and articles.
[00:08:18.941 --> 00:08:23.564]  Remember last week the Swedish government that hadn't been in a war in over 200 years?
[00:08:25.985 --> 00:08:27.206]  Has never had Russia attack them.
[00:08:29.417 --> 00:08:38.184]  Their defense minister came out at a public forum and said we are going to have war with Russia, it's a foregone conclusion, and Russia is going to attack us.
[00:08:40.026 --> 00:08:47.692]  Now Russia for nine years said we will invade Ukraine if we keep putting NATO troops in there and if we keep attacking Russians that live there, which is the majority.
[00:08:48.593 --> 00:08:49.534]  Russia has started.
[00:08:50.435 --> 00:08:53.377]  Russia has said 100% we are not going to attack anybody.
[00:08:54.398 --> 00:08:55.219]  We are defensive.
[00:08:56.289 --> 00:08:57.330]  We don't want a nuclear war.
[00:08:58.091 --> 00:08:59.732]  And that's been their defense policy.
[00:09:00.833 --> 00:09:01.373]  That didn't matter.
[00:09:02.714 --> 00:09:15.485]  The Swedish defense minister said, I've been meeting with the other ministers in NATO and the US and Canada, Australia, and war is going to happen.
[00:09:16.106 --> 00:09:24.353]  Well, now the British defense ministry has officially come out and said that the path to war is here and that full scale global war
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.721]  is going to happen in the next year.
[00:09:32.683 --> 00:09:41.726]  And they predict full war with Russia as early as next month.
[00:09:43.306 --> 00:09:46.848]  And then they push it out to February of next year, a year from now, 13 months.
[00:09:47.768 --> 00:09:48.608]  I have it all right here.
[00:09:48.869 --> 00:09:49.789]  I read all the reports.
[00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:52.530]  But it gets worse.
[00:09:54.306 --> 00:10:05.412]  Leaked German military document that tells countdown to World War III and Germany's official defense policy is that they will be at full war, including nuclear, with the Russians imminently.
[00:10:07.393 --> 00:10:10.154]  You might want to go read the Jamie White article.
[00:10:10.214 --> 00:10:11.415]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:10:11.435 --> 00:10:12.195]  You might want to share it.
[00:10:13.816 --> 00:10:15.376]  We're going to post it on X right now.
[00:10:18.038 --> 00:10:21.980]  We're also streaming there at X, reaching millions a day, so please repost, retweet.
[00:10:23.226 --> 00:10:40.877]  The live show from Real Alex Jones and Infowars.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.
[00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:56.550]  With this Business Insider Report because I've been following what they're doing.
[00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:02.472]  He's been purging the top generals because they're refusing to invade Taiwan.
[00:11:02.532 --> 00:11:03.932]  He's basically already told them to.
[00:11:04.832 --> 00:11:06.533]  And they said, but that'll lead to nuclear war.
[00:11:06.553 --> 00:11:07.573]  And he said, so what?
[00:11:11.394 --> 00:11:13.735]  And China's the big enemy other than the globalists because
[00:11:14.704 --> 00:11:16.105]  They've set up the Castle Society.
[00:11:16.145 --> 00:11:17.366]  They have the Uyghurs in the camps.
[00:11:17.426 --> 00:11:18.947]  They sell the political dissidence organs.
[00:11:19.727 --> 00:11:21.849]  They were set up by the New World Order to dominate us.
[00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:24.150]  Now, they broke in with the Anglo-American establishment.
[00:11:24.731 --> 00:11:29.034]  And every time I say that, I see on X, fools go, he's attacking the white people again.
[00:11:29.414 --> 00:11:30.575]  No, I'm not, Joy Reid.
[00:11:31.155 --> 00:11:34.457]  That's the name of what King Charles calls himself.
[00:11:34.998 --> 00:11:42.863]  That's the old official name of the British Empire merged with the Dutch Empire, the European continental system, and the United States.
[00:11:42.883 --> 00:11:44.204]  That's what they call themselves.
[00:11:45.124 --> 00:11:47.407]  In their own documents, that's their official title.
[00:11:47.447 --> 00:11:50.710]  So when Putin addresses them, he says, the Anglo-Americans.
[00:11:55.795 --> 00:11:58.257]  Sometimes the ignorance level is just stunning, you know.
[00:11:58.557 --> 00:12:01.080]  Oh, there goes Jones blaming the white people again.
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.522]  He's like, Joy Reid.
[00:12:05.884 --> 00:12:06.485]  God help us.
[00:12:06.645 --> 00:12:08.347]  I just actually know the political names.
[00:12:13.615 --> 00:12:15.876]  That the different systems call themselves by.
[00:12:17.457 --> 00:12:34.645]  So, the Communist Chinese, led by their dictator, Xi Jinping, is officially removed almost all the top leadership in the military and has now got hardliners in that are begging for war.
[00:12:34.905 --> 00:12:35.546]  And they're getting ready.
[00:12:37.247 --> 00:12:40.148]  The British Ministry of Defense says they believe China will move the next year.
[00:12:40.948 --> 00:12:41.929]  Full war in
[00:12:43.615 --> 00:12:46.316]  The Asian-Pacific area in the South China Sea.
[00:12:49.677 --> 00:12:49.957]  Okay?
[00:12:51.318 --> 00:12:53.138]  Times of India and others are also reporting on it.
[00:12:53.759 --> 00:12:56.820]  So, leaked German military document that tells countdown to World War III.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.120]  I'm going to read this in a moment.
[00:12:59.121 --> 00:12:59.461]  G.G.
[00:12:59.481 --> 00:13:01.942]  Ping, purging the military ahead of total war.
[00:13:03.362 --> 00:13:08.124]  British Ministry of Defense spokesman, Britain facing wars in Russia, China, Iran, North Korea.
[00:13:09.318 --> 00:13:13.421]  Full war, we're in the pre-war phase, warns Grant Chaps.
[00:13:18.526 --> 00:13:20.087]  Here's another big RT headline.
[00:13:20.227 --> 00:13:24.290]  Globalists lack supporters, but they have the nukes, says Alex Jones.
[00:13:24.851 --> 00:13:26.612]  Really powerful 23-minute interview.
[00:13:27.553 --> 00:13:28.854]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:13:30.495 --> 00:13:31.136]  With yours truly.
[00:13:32.477 --> 00:13:36.881]  All right, so I'm going to read these articles on air.
[00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:40.171]  We're coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:13:40.312 --> 00:13:49.935]  I'm going to give everybody a chance to email and text their friends and family and neighbors and strangers or acquaintances and tell them, tune into Infowars.com forward slash show in the forbidden feed.
[00:13:50.315 --> 00:13:52.436]  You need to hear about total war and how we stop it.
[00:13:53.137 --> 00:13:55.798]  So you got about 16, 17 minutes till we're back from that segment.
[00:13:56.198 --> 00:14:01.900]  I'm going to hit other news that ties into it now, but please ask everybody to tune in because that's how we overpower the system.
[00:14:03.541 --> 00:14:04.441]  It's an information war.
[00:14:06.121 --> 00:14:10.984]  Now, how are these insane globalists going to get this done?
[00:14:12.485 --> 00:14:20.890]  Well, they have to first secure the country with the weapons and the resources for all of this, because you're not going to like the national draft.
[00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:23.071]  The Democrats are openly saying they're getting ready to bring back.
[00:14:23.091 --> 00:14:26.994]  You're not going to like your daughters, because we have equity now.
[00:14:27.074 --> 00:14:28.195]  We have equality now.
[00:14:28.315 --> 00:14:34.999]  So, women are going to get drafted for the robot wars that are already started.
[00:14:37.984 --> 00:14:42.987]  But to make sure the country is divided so we can't come together and say no to all these wars and open borders and the rest of it.
[00:14:44.448 --> 00:14:52.493]  It's an old talking point, but now it's gone from a drumbeat to a cacophonous finale.
[00:14:58.516 --> 00:14:59.137]  A crescendo.
[00:15:02.143 --> 00:15:04.504]  Of white people are the problem.
[00:15:04.564 --> 00:15:06.065]  White people are inherently evil.
[00:15:06.525 --> 00:15:08.046]  Every problem is white people.
[00:15:08.086 --> 00:15:10.047]  Being white is inherently a crime.
[00:15:10.107 --> 00:15:11.628]  That's taught in all the major universities.
[00:15:12.368 --> 00:15:13.769]  You see the university heads defending it.
[00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:15.029]  That's just what they're doing.
[00:15:15.049 --> 00:15:18.291]  It's all CIA, globalist run for total divide and conquer.
[00:15:19.512 --> 00:15:23.914]  Now, Rachel Maddow and Joy Reid and all the usual suspects came out last night when Trump won Iowa.
[00:15:24.874 --> 00:15:25.835]  We'll play those clips in a moment.
[00:15:25.855 --> 00:15:26.275]  Skip the break.
[00:15:30.157 --> 00:15:35.279]  They said, well you'll hear what they said, but they said Iowa is white.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.081]  That's why they voted Trump.
[00:15:39.921 --> 00:15:46.524]  And Trump is a fascist and going to be a dictator, so we got to remove him off the ballot and or remove the control of the military from him.
[00:15:46.824 --> 00:15:54.047]  We've already been talking a lot about that, all these former Secretary of Defense heads and CIA heads and all the usual suspects are saying.
[00:15:55.123 --> 00:15:56.384]  Trump is going to censor you.
[00:15:56.424 --> 00:15:57.584]  Trump is going to surveil you.
[00:15:57.644 --> 00:15:58.845]  Trump is going to enslave you.
[00:15:59.465 --> 00:16:00.866]  Trump is going to persecute you.
[00:16:00.906 --> 00:16:02.107]  Trump is going to take you to war.
[00:16:03.167 --> 00:16:05.909]  Everything they're doing, total inversion.
[00:16:06.449 --> 00:16:09.271]  It's not projection because they know they're lying.
[00:16:09.751 --> 00:16:14.774]  Projection is when you subconsciously think about yourself and push it off onto somebody else.
[00:16:15.114 --> 00:16:15.774]  Maybe you're a thief.
[00:16:15.794 --> 00:16:17.535]  You think everybody else around you is a thief.
[00:16:18.476 --> 00:16:19.036]  Stuff like that.
[00:16:19.056 --> 00:16:22.378]  Or you hate yourself deep down so you hate everybody else around you.
[00:16:23.188 --> 00:16:26.869]  Or you're nervous about your own life and losing control, so you try to control everybody else's life.
[00:16:27.489 --> 00:16:29.210]  You know, loser behavior.
[00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:34.411]  You don't control people, you lead people.
[00:16:34.731 --> 00:16:36.311]  But they never figure that out.
[00:16:36.732 --> 00:16:40.092]  So this is inversion when they consciously flip it on its head.
[00:16:43.413 --> 00:16:49.355]  But the biggest thing you gotta come away with, and I look these numbers up, Jack Pacific's dead on, this is the official federal numbers.
[00:16:51.449 --> 00:16:52.930]  I've got them right here out of Iowa.
[00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:55.952]  Trump spent $340 per vote in Iowa.
[00:16:55.992 --> 00:16:56.712]  The Santa spent $1,697.96.
[00:16:56.892 --> 00:16:58.614]  And Nikki Haley spent $1,797.84.
[00:16:59.274 --> 00:17:04.277]  So, five, six, seven, eight times more money.
[00:17:18.851 --> 00:17:20.112]  Who's got the grassroots support?
[00:17:20.192 --> 00:17:20.472]  Trump.
[00:17:21.073 --> 00:17:29.099]  All that money, and DeSantis came in a pathetic second, way behind Trump.
[00:17:29.359 --> 00:17:30.721]  Trump 51 plus percent of the vote.
[00:17:31.501 --> 00:17:36.645]  Mickey Haley came in a distant third, but then she declared victory and said, it's now a two-person race.
[00:17:36.846 --> 00:17:37.306]  I won.
[00:17:40.609 --> 00:17:41.990]  And you're like, wow, that doesn't make sense.
[00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:48.035]  Well, you're not young enough to be the last 25 years where we have fuzzy math where two plus two can equal
[00:17:49.892 --> 00:17:53.555]  Whatever you want it to equal.
[00:17:55.457 --> 00:17:57.819]  So these videos are all on Infowars.com.
[00:17:57.999 --> 00:18:10.450]  I've also reposted them on RealAlexJones on X. Joy Reid has a meltdown over Trump and Iowa caucuses smears white Christians as racist in two different videos and says whiteness is the problem.
[00:18:11.871 --> 00:18:16.074]  Meanwhile, this woman's like a clown demon and then she's got her
[00:18:17.359 --> 00:18:22.630]  Blonde hair, her cultural appropriation, which I think is fine for her to have blonde hair.
[00:18:25.225 --> 00:18:25.966]  That's hilarious.
[00:18:27.307 --> 00:18:30.749]  It's like people saying cornrows are black since home appropriation.
[00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:34.092]  White people have been braiding their hair since white people existed.
[00:18:34.192 --> 00:18:34.992]  Same thing with black people.
[00:18:35.312 --> 00:18:37.174]  It's just all mental illness.
[00:18:37.194 --> 00:18:38.475]  They came out yesterday, I never got to it.
[00:18:38.875 --> 00:18:40.496]  Guys, re-pull it out of the stack and reprint it, I forgot.
[00:18:40.997 --> 00:18:47.521]  Major leftist organizations, universities come out and say, watch the government has come out and said breastfeeding is bad and racist.
[00:18:50.196 --> 00:18:52.637]  Yeah, that's why mammals have breasts and breastfeed.
[00:18:52.657 --> 00:18:53.978]  That's what you know a mammal by.
[00:18:53.998 --> 00:18:54.898]  A mammal has hair.
[00:18:54.918 --> 00:18:57.159]  A mammal is warm-blooded.
[00:18:58.059 --> 00:19:00.340]  And a mammal breastfeeds its young.
[00:19:03.762 --> 00:19:08.684]  But again, they're just assailing logic, science, common sense, while saying they're the science.
[00:19:08.704 --> 00:19:11.185]  Like, there's no X and Y chromosomes now.
[00:19:11.565 --> 00:19:14.226]  Bill Guy, the science guy, says they don't teach that now.
[00:19:15.806 --> 00:19:19.228]  Because if you know about science, you won't want Bayer Pharmaceutical
[00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:36.237]  That knowingly put out tens of millions of doses of Factor VIII blood clotting compound in the 80s and 90s, and when their own documents came out in court, they sat around and bragged and said, well, there are too many hemophiliacs.
[00:19:36.337 --> 00:19:37.297]  Let's just kill them.
[00:19:40.919 --> 00:19:41.359]  There it is.
[00:19:41.479 --> 00:19:42.699]  Slavery and racism.
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:44.780]  That's the Washington Post.
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.721]  Drive a toxic double standard about breastfeeding.
[00:19:47.761 --> 00:19:48.161]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:19:51.792 --> 00:19:52.472]  One from a few years ago.
[00:19:52.492 --> 00:19:54.013]  Another's a federal government.
[00:19:54.033 --> 00:19:55.454]  It was in my stack yesterday.
[00:19:55.794 --> 00:19:58.235]  A federal agency's come out and said they've got to stop it.
[00:19:58.295 --> 00:19:58.675]  It's bad.
[00:19:59.976 --> 00:20:02.217]  And said they need to basically outlaw it after six months.
[00:20:02.237 --> 00:20:03.618]  I'm not kidding.
[00:20:04.158 --> 00:20:07.840]  Because it's racist saying it's good because it keeps women out of the workforce.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.101]  How dare you stay with your baby?
[00:20:09.961 --> 00:20:10.882]  But I'm digressing.
[00:20:12.742 --> 00:20:16.424]  It's like when the Daily Beast came out a few years ago and said milk is racist.
[00:20:19.306 --> 00:20:19.466]  So,
[00:20:21.035 --> 00:20:25.276]  They're teaching everyone not to see the mega banks, the black rocks, taking over our lives.
[00:20:25.836 --> 00:20:27.577]  Poisoning us with 5G and GMO.
[00:20:27.597 --> 00:20:35.979]  No, they just want to all look at each other, what we look like, and then all fight with each other so they can easily rule over us.
[00:20:36.019 --> 00:20:37.479]  But I didn't get into Bayer, I'm sorry.
[00:20:37.499 --> 00:20:40.780]  The same people that brought you the deadly Factor A products.
[00:20:43.421 --> 00:20:45.681]  They're modifying, and so is Bill Gates, they're all doing it.
[00:20:46.301 --> 00:20:49.082]  Soil microbes, they say, will take over the world's soil.
[00:20:50.752 --> 00:20:56.495]  Get this, so plants don't need nitrogen anymore, so it's a way to bomb and destroy the soil of the planet.
[00:20:57.335 --> 00:21:04.098]  And then scientists warn it will probably cause giant dust bowls like we see in the Andromeda Strain and in Interstellar, but for real.
[00:21:04.698 --> 00:21:05.819]  And they say that's okay.
[00:21:06.959 --> 00:21:11.461]  They're going ahead and spreading it everywhere to change how the soil operates completely.
[00:21:12.916 --> 00:21:14.817]  I don't know.
[00:21:34.262 --> 00:21:38.506]  And so they are a weapon system activated by El Diablo.
[00:21:39.306 --> 00:21:44.551]  When you study them, they even believe they're channeling off-world entities that give them all these great ideas.
[00:21:45.291 --> 00:21:46.913]  None of them are atheists, they are Satanists.
[00:21:48.109 --> 00:21:49.930]  And they're being promised to become gods.
[00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:55.953]  If they kill everything on the planet, they will be uploaded to a Megamind machine and travel the universe forever.
[00:21:56.353 --> 00:21:57.814]  You go, wait, that's Childhood's End.
[00:21:58.534 --> 00:22:03.437]  Well, you've all know Harari and a bunch of them came out the WF and said, actually, humans are just bad.
[00:22:03.477 --> 00:22:06.638]  We're going to end war by getting rid of your bodies and uploading you to machines.
[00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:07.539]  You're like, that's crazy.
[00:22:08.059 --> 00:22:08.700]  Uh, yeah.
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.341]  But it's the same transmission.
[00:22:13.288 --> 00:22:16.331]  You know, since he wrote Childhood's End back in the 60s, or was it the 50s?
[00:22:16.391 --> 00:22:17.812]  It was his first big novel.
[00:22:18.513 --> 00:22:20.195]  Arthur C. Clarke was a big occultist.
[00:22:22.016 --> 00:22:27.622]  He had the Jeffrey Epstein type proclivities for underage boys.
[00:22:28.863 --> 00:22:34.208]  And he was MI6, OSS before that, the inventor of the telecommunications satellite.
[00:22:36.138 --> 00:22:52.982]  The Russians first launched one, Sputnik, but he was the inventor of it, and he just, he just, he was channeling this message of loving ten-foot tall red devils that come to Earth and dissolve our children's souls up into a big pyramid spaceship.
[00:22:58.284 --> 00:23:00.164]  Very nice people.
[00:23:01.104 --> 00:23:02.325]  And you're like, well that's just a movie.
[00:23:02.485 --> 00:23:02.765]  Uh-huh.
[00:23:03.852 --> 00:23:11.934]  And now, they're actually setting it all up, and if they can just get us straight to nuclear war, that's probably the best thing they want.
[00:23:12.934 --> 00:23:15.255]  See, the aliens get us to kill ourselves.
[00:23:15.755 --> 00:23:18.235]  And notice, when I talk about this, the media never makes jokes about this.
[00:23:18.255 --> 00:23:19.575]  They don't even talk about it, like, oh, do-do-do.
[00:23:19.615 --> 00:23:24.597]  Because, you know, I talk to top generals and all the people, and they're like, oh, yes, that's what the Pentagon believes as well, yes.
[00:23:25.517 --> 00:23:29.498]  Everybody knows this is, that there's interdimensional forces, we're being influenced.
[00:23:29.518 --> 00:23:30.798]  Now, Tucker Carlson talks about it.
[00:23:32.128 --> 00:23:38.774]  The invasion comes through sub-space interdimensional communication systems.
[00:23:39.355 --> 00:23:47.583]  And of course you know dark matter is five times more powerful in its gravity and its energy than what we call our own dimension.
[00:23:47.983 --> 00:23:51.326]  And that is the higher dimensions bleeding in.
[00:23:51.366 --> 00:23:55.710]  There's a force five times stronger holding all of this in place artificially.
[00:23:55.991 --> 00:23:57.072]  The entire universe
[00:24:01.067 --> 00:24:03.809]  You see, it's more real than this.
[00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:06.211]  It's more dense than this.
[00:24:06.891 --> 00:24:08.432]  It's more complex than this.
[00:24:11.895 --> 00:24:13.116]  This is the third dimension.
[00:24:14.217 --> 00:24:16.178]  This is the first dimension of matter.
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:26.626]  This is the lowest level other than the chaos gods that the Greeks first wrote about.
[00:24:30.768 --> 00:24:32.309]  So you see that in culture everywhere.
[00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:36.073]  People say, well, Jones must be a Warhammer fan.
[00:24:36.093 --> 00:24:37.154]  Nope, never even knew what it was.
[00:24:37.334 --> 00:24:38.195]  That's everything he says.
[00:24:38.595 --> 00:24:42.099]  Because that's what it is, folks.
[00:24:42.419 --> 00:24:45.462]  And you're going to figure it out real fast.
[00:24:46.411 --> 00:24:49.113]  That there is a spirit attacking us.
[00:24:49.153 --> 00:24:53.056]  There is a transmission blasting through into our universe.
[00:24:53.917 --> 00:25:03.384]  And its message is, when you take the DMT and the government facilities, it's all come out, is they talk to these aliens and all the aliens do is say, you'll live forever, join us, upload yourself to the machine.
[00:25:03.644 --> 00:25:05.145]  But first, you've got to kill everybody.
[00:25:05.566 --> 00:25:06.286]  You've got to kill everybody.
[00:25:06.306 --> 00:25:07.347]  You've got to kill everybody.
[00:25:07.367 --> 00:25:08.348]  You've got to depopulate everybody.
[00:25:08.368 --> 00:25:08.988]  You've got to kill.
[00:25:09.008 --> 00:25:09.989]  You've got to kill.
[00:25:10.269 --> 00:25:10.910]  You've got to kill.
[00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:11.831]  You've got to kill.
[00:25:11.851 --> 00:25:12.751]  You've got to kill.
[00:25:12.771 --> 00:25:13.592]  You've got to kill.
[00:25:18.578 --> 00:25:20.279]  So you sit back and go, none of this is logical.
[00:25:20.319 --> 00:25:21.140]  This is insane.
[00:25:23.101 --> 00:25:27.524]  And it's because they are evil spirits.
[00:25:27.564 --> 00:25:28.684]  They are demon possessed.
[00:25:28.724 --> 00:25:29.945]  They are resonating.
[00:25:29.965 --> 00:25:32.687]  When you look at a Bill Gates or a Fauci, they have that evil look.
[00:25:32.787 --> 00:25:35.429]  Or Joy Reid or Rachel Maddow.
[00:25:35.469 --> 00:25:37.450]  They're on the bad guy's team.
[00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:39.291]  The Bible's real, folks.
[00:25:40.792 --> 00:25:41.833]  It's just your preachers.
[00:25:44.031 --> 00:25:48.313]  Our priests that get in your way between you and God and the reality.
[00:25:48.713 --> 00:25:54.075]  So you look at the system and the corrupt churches and you think, well that's not God, I'm rejecting this.
[00:25:54.456 --> 00:26:00.838]  That's because most of those churches are people seeking power to get between you and God.
[00:26:01.019 --> 00:26:03.920]  But God's 100% all around you at all times.
[00:26:05.489 --> 00:26:08.391]  God isn't even one electron away.
[00:26:08.471 --> 00:26:12.994]  God is all in you, around you, but you've got to connect to it.
[00:26:13.014 --> 00:26:14.095]  I'm not saying we're God.
[00:26:14.456 --> 00:26:15.897]  God made all of this.
[00:26:16.537 --> 00:26:19.299]  God is in everything, everywhere, at all times.
[00:26:22.581 --> 00:26:25.684]  Except destruction of innocence and free will.
[00:26:26.843 --> 00:26:41.448]  And consciously going against God and murdering children, God removes himself from those spaces and that's why evil does the rituals and does the bad things because it's like chemistry or like mathematics or like it is quantum mechanics.
[00:26:41.908 --> 00:26:53.572]  God removes his energy field from those areas where that's happening and that's why everything is cursed when you allow evil to be carried out because God starts withdrawing his energy field.
[00:26:56.365 --> 00:27:01.688]  And then the evil can operate in those areas with a freer hand.
[00:27:02.828 --> 00:27:19.797]  So it's all about, just like you go into a military attack and the enemy's got jammers that jam your radar and jam your missiles, all the rest of it, the devil gets you to commit all this evil and to refuse God and reject the Holy Spirit so that he can set up his jamming operation and get full control.
[00:27:21.781 --> 00:27:36.389]  And if Satan gets full control of our governments, the second that God's holding it back, instantly they'll fire the missiles from the satellites, they'll fire the missiles from the submarines, they'll fire the missiles from their bases.
[00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:43.474]  I mean, the minute Satan gets control control of one government that has nuclear weapons, instantly they're fired.
[00:27:44.694 --> 00:27:49.037]  That's what the Bible says, if God didn't intervene, no flesh would be spared on the earth.
[00:27:50.239 --> 00:27:55.262]  Now you learn Xi Jinping has fired hundreds and hundreds of generals, sometimes 8, 9, 10 a day.
[00:27:56.984 --> 00:27:59.765]  Because he's ordered them to do psychotic stuff and they said no.
[00:28:01.106 --> 00:28:02.087]  You're relieved of command.
[00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:10.513]  So, the minute Satan gets full control,
[00:28:14.847 --> 00:28:25.949]  I mean, first he wants to seduce the planet and get your soul and have you bow down to him, but once he's got enough people to claw with him into his own dimension, his own artificial dimension, that's what they're telling you.
[00:28:25.989 --> 00:28:26.789]  Oh, the computers!
[00:28:26.849 --> 00:28:27.549]  Oh, the machines!
[00:28:27.569 --> 00:28:29.870]  We're going to make a whole other universe in cyberspace!
[00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:33.990]  They're all keep attempting to build the same thing, the metaverse, a hellscape.
[00:28:34.991 --> 00:28:37.971]  All right, I'm going to stop preaching and get technical.
[00:28:38.451 --> 00:28:41.672]  When we come back, I'm going to get into the incredible race war they're drumming up.
[00:28:43.823 --> 00:28:49.155]  Then I'm going to get into World War III that's already here.
[00:28:50.257 --> 00:28:51.099]  It's a big broadcast.
[00:28:51.119 --> 00:28:53.023]  We've got a bunch of key financial news coming up as well.
[00:28:53.123 --> 00:28:53.624]  Please stay with us.
[00:28:59.977 --> 00:29:04.259]  79 years on air, all I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalists.
[00:29:04.979 --> 00:29:10.282]  And I've done the best job I can to tell the truth and be accurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[00:29:10.682 --> 00:29:18.045]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves, unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people, we don't do that.
[00:29:18.506 --> 00:29:20.406]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[00:29:20.787 --> 00:29:23.428]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product, it's so powerful.
[00:29:24.349 --> 00:29:29.356]  This is the breakdown product, after your cells process it, of folic acid.
[00:29:29.917 --> 00:29:34.404]  Methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[00:29:34.864 --> 00:29:36.106]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[00:29:36.146 --> 00:29:37.007]  It's not a stimulant.
[00:29:37.248 --> 00:29:39.070]  It energizes your cells.
[00:29:39.631 --> 00:29:42.114]  And that everything else you take just supercharges it.
[00:29:42.154 --> 00:29:42.994]  It's so insane.
[00:29:43.355 --> 00:29:44.856]  It's foundational energy.
[00:29:45.317 --> 00:29:49.461]  The strongest formula out there at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:29:49.861 --> 00:29:53.905]  It doesn't just energize this operation against the tyrants, it energizes you.
[00:29:54.185 --> 00:29:55.587]  Get foundational energy now!
[00:29:59.528 --> 00:30:01.150]  I'm not on Team NFL.
[00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:02.931]  I'm not on Team NBA.
[00:30:03.111 --> 00:30:04.072]  I'm not on Team Olympics.
[00:30:04.373 --> 00:30:07.796]  I'm not on Team Globalist or Wokism in the New World Order.
[00:30:08.036 --> 00:30:18.285]  I'm on Team Humanity, ladies and gentlemen, that loves God and loves our families and loves humanity and knows that we're destined to do even more incredible things than we've already done together.
[00:30:18.445 --> 00:30:22.129]  And so, inspired by my conversation with Elon Musk recently,
[00:30:22.849 --> 00:30:29.456]  We've launched two limited edition t-shirts at Infowarstore.com.
[00:30:29.716 --> 00:30:33.680]  Let people know that, hey, it isn't about the football games, or is it even about the UFC?
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:38.264]  It's about team humanity being under globalist attack.
[00:30:38.544 --> 00:30:38.864]  You kid.
[00:30:39.565 --> 00:30:48.508]  Wear it, it's a great conversation starter, and you know it's supporting the InfoWar that is at the very tip of the spear in the fight for Team Humanity.
[00:30:48.828 --> 00:30:53.510]  Get your limited edition Team Humanity t-shirts right now at InfoWarStore.com, and I thank you.
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.281]  Real death is shutting off the economy.
[00:31:01.481 --> 00:31:03.803]  The bureaucrats and the corporations control the economy.
[00:31:04.123 --> 00:31:07.606]  As they vertically integrate the economy and consolidate power, they murder people en masse.
[00:31:08.246 --> 00:31:16.252]  And Elon Musk has warned them that if you destroy civilization, you won't be able to have certain redoubts of it, and certain city-states still have it, the Hunger Games model.
[00:31:16.572 --> 00:31:20.896]  It will destroy the elite as well, and anybody that studies history and has common sense knows that.
[00:31:21.576 --> 00:31:26.561]  The wars that are going to come out of the starvation and the inflation are being blamed on global warming.
[00:31:26.782 --> 00:31:29.504]  The viruses that come out of the labs are being blamed on global warming.
[00:31:29.725 --> 00:31:33.168]  The third world hordes being organized by the UN to invade are being blamed on global warming.
[00:31:34.009 --> 00:31:35.711]  The mass starvation is blamed on the virus.
[00:31:37.152 --> 00:31:39.375]  And everywhere we're told it's going to get worse.
[00:31:39.475 --> 00:31:40.436]  Billions are coming.
[00:31:40.596 --> 00:31:42.918]  Al Gore and Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton.
[00:31:43.823 --> 00:31:50.968]  And the Rothschilds and the Davos Group and Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and Yuval Noah Harari say billions are coming to Europe.
[00:31:51.188 --> 00:31:52.649]  A billion are coming to the U.S.
[00:31:53.129 --> 00:31:54.410]  because of climate change.
[00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:59.333]  No, because you cut their economy off because the IMF and World Bank controls the loans and ordered lockdowns.
[00:31:59.853 --> 00:32:06.337]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the globalist agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[00:32:06.377 --> 00:32:20.565]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections, masquerading as vaccines.
[00:32:20.745 --> 00:32:25.648]  It is so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives oblivious.
[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:29.730]  He realized, if it's not bliss, it equals death.
[00:32:31.394 --> 00:32:51.832]  But people are starting to really understand how serious things are, and that's a hard thing to do, because to wake up to a dystopic reality and realize that we're in the middle of a giant biological weapons war against humanity, and that there's mass sterilization that's already taking place, and they're cutting off all the major energy sources, is really hard to deal with, but it's the reality.
[00:32:52.393 --> 00:32:56.577]  Facing it is our only chance to turn this around, because stuff's about to get really, really nasty.
[00:32:56.977 --> 00:32:57.618]  InfoWars.com.
[00:33:01.846 --> 00:33:05.928]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:06.448 --> 00:33:07.789]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:13.111 --> 00:33:13.832]  Big Brother.
[00:33:14.812 --> 00:33:16.073]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:17.133 --> 00:33:18.294]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:18.914 --> 00:33:20.375]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:20.995 --> 00:33:22.355]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:23.156 --> 00:33:27.778]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:46.500]  All right, my friends, let's dive into the home front and Trump's magnificent win in Iowa, 50 plus percent of the vote against four other candidates.
[00:33:47.381 --> 00:33:53.666]  Vivek Ramaswamy wisely has ended his campaign to join forces and support Trump.
[00:33:55.488 --> 00:33:57.610]  But of course, the operatives have not.
[00:33:58.931 --> 00:34:01.654]  The worst among them, of course, being Birdbrain.
[00:34:03.897 --> 00:34:07.983]  Nikki Haley and her married band of neocon warmongers.
[00:34:10.165 --> 00:34:12.729]  So, what did Joy Reid and Rachel Maddow and all of them do?
[00:34:12.749 --> 00:34:14.912]  And they did this on CNN too, not as MSNBC.
[00:34:16.173 --> 00:34:19.498]  They came out and said, the problem is the white people.
[00:34:19.558 --> 00:34:19.959]  Here it is.
[00:34:22.042 --> 00:34:32.426]  But you know, I feel like the important sort of data point, and you know, Steve talks about it a lot, he's going to probably talk about it a little more tonight, is that these are white Christians.
[00:34:33.126 --> 00:34:40.189]  That this is a state that is over-represented by white Christians that are going to participate in these caucuses, especially tonight.
[00:34:41.009 --> 00:34:48.313]  I today, earlier today, reached out to Robert Jones, Robbie Jones, from the Public Religion Research Institute, knowing that we were going to talk about Iowa.
[00:34:48.393 --> 00:34:51.094]  And this is a hyper-evangelical white state.
[00:34:51.614 --> 00:34:52.755]  And he said the following to me.
[00:34:52.975 --> 00:34:55.556]  Iowa is about 61% white Christian.
[00:34:55.817 --> 00:34:59.338]  The country as a whole is approximately 41% white Christian.
[00:34:59.738 --> 00:35:02.200]  And in Iowa, we're talking about evangelical white Christians.
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.080]  And he said the following.
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:06.982]  Because I asked him, what do they get out of supporting Donald Trump?
[00:35:07.042 --> 00:35:11.572]  Because he keeps losing, he keeps delivering losses and losses and losses, and he said the following...
[00:35:12.463 --> 00:35:19.487]  They see themselves as the rightful inheritors of this country, and Trump has promised to give it back to them.
[00:35:20.548 --> 00:35:38.339]  All the things that we think about, about electability, about what are people gaming out, none of that matters when you believe that God has given you this country, that it is yours, and that everyone who is not a white conservative Christian is a fraudulent American, is a less
[00:35:39.622 --> 00:35:41.083]  A less real American.
[00:35:41.443 --> 00:35:42.724]  Then you don't care about electability.
[00:35:43.044 --> 00:35:46.546]  And I think to the point that you made, Steph, I mean, it's the elephant in the room.
[00:35:47.646 --> 00:35:48.727]  She's still a brown lady.
[00:35:49.901 --> 00:35:58.784]  That's gotta try to win in a party that is deeply anti-immigrant and which accepts the notion that you can say immigrants are poisoning the blood of our country.
[00:35:59.264 --> 00:36:02.445]  She's getting, you know, birthered by Donald Trump.
[00:36:03.465 --> 00:36:08.027]  And I don't care how much the Democrats elect her, which will ramp up a lot, the better she does in New Hampshire.
[00:36:08.347 --> 00:36:09.607]  So it's still a challenge.
[00:36:09.767 --> 00:36:15.089]  I don't see how she becomes the nominee of that party with Donald Trump still around.
[00:36:15.269 --> 00:36:16.770]  I can't picture it happening.
[00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:17.530]  Maybe it could happen.
[00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:23.515]  Ron DeSantis' only argument for staying in it is he's the white guy, that he can still make the appeal to white Americans.
[00:36:23.535 --> 00:36:42.670]  While we have the big picture takeaway from that, and I don't mean to be, again, too dark as you said on this, but it is not, if we are worried about the rise of authoritarianism in this country, we are worried about potential rise of fascism in this country, we're worried about our democracy falling to an authoritarian and potentially fascist form of government.
[00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:46.433]  The leader who is trying to do that is part of that equation.
[00:36:46.713 --> 00:36:46.893]  Mm-hmm.
[00:36:47.053 --> 00:36:48.295]  But people wanting that.
[00:36:48.315 --> 00:36:48.775]  Correct.
[00:36:48.795 --> 00:36:50.377]  Is a much bigger part of that expression.
[00:36:50.878 --> 00:36:54.181]  And the American electorate is made up of two major parties.
[00:36:54.802 --> 00:37:00.328]  One of those parties has been flirting with extremism on the ultra-right for a very long time.
[00:37:00.408 --> 00:37:05.854]  They've brought them in in a way that they haven't been central to Republican electoral politics ever before.
[00:37:05.894 --> 00:37:07.275]  And I know because I've been studying this.
[00:37:07.996 --> 00:37:15.344]  But once you have radicalized one major party so that those are the preferences of the people who adhere to your party, the leader is interchangeable.
[00:37:15.765 --> 00:37:17.987]  And yes, Trumpism is sometimes what we call it.
[00:37:18.427 --> 00:37:20.289]  MAGA movement is probably a better way to do it.
[00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:26.496]  But there is an authoritarian movement inside Republican politics that isn't being bamboozled by Trump.
[00:37:26.696 --> 00:37:28.397]  Alright, so I'm sorry to subject you to those people's voices, but
[00:37:55.579 --> 00:37:56.220]  It's got to be done.
[00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:58.361]  Everything they say is them.
[00:37:58.561 --> 00:38:19.152]  They are racially basing everything and they are making everything about race and they're bringing people in and saying we're going to outnumber the white people and we're going to have them identify racially and they're destroying the melting pot and trying to get people to not accept and adopt American values, which is what made this country so great.
[00:38:20.913 --> 00:38:22.334]  And so yes, every county
[00:38:24.395 --> 00:38:32.040]  Is now reporting, except one, but it goes back and forth, that Trump won every county in Iowa.
[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:33.801]  So here are some of these headlines.
[00:38:34.322 --> 00:38:38.865]  Joy Reed has a meltdown over Trump and Iowa Congress smears white Christians.
[00:38:40.386 --> 00:38:41.587]  See, they hate Christians, period.
[00:38:42.427 --> 00:38:44.749]  Watch, Maddow melts down over rise of fascism.
[00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:48.711]  Trump wants to use military against his domestic enemies.
[00:38:49.072 --> 00:38:52.294]  Congress must act now to remove the war powers from the President.
[00:38:54.592 --> 00:38:59.816]  That's a coup, folks.
[00:38:59.836 --> 00:39:11.045]  They're introducing legislation, Senator Blumenthal, to remove the power of military control from the President when that's in the Constitution.
[00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:25.351]  Congress then has to declare an official war and fund it, but the President has police powers, emergency powers, since the law was passed with Thomas Jefferson, the Insurrection Act, and Trump's not discussed the Insurrection Act.
[00:39:25.371 --> 00:39:27.854]  They've been talking about using it against Trump supporters.
[00:39:29.264 --> 00:39:36.352]  They've never convicted anybody of their fake insurrection act, though they've taken him off the ballot in multiple states saying he's guilty of insurrection.
[00:39:36.692 --> 00:39:42.618]  So they turn around and say he's going to use the insurrection act when they're already using it, though he's not been found guilty of it.
[00:39:42.679 --> 00:39:45.462]  See, everything they say is what they're doing on its face.
[00:39:47.336 --> 00:39:48.377]  But here's one out of Politico.
[00:39:48.817 --> 00:39:51.420]  Why the world's betting against American democracy.
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:54.262]  Oh, MI6, the British government.
[00:39:54.342 --> 00:39:56.344]  Other governments say Trump must be stopped.
[00:39:56.764 --> 00:39:59.606]  Oh, foreign governments saying stop us voting for who we want.
[00:40:01.027 --> 00:40:03.530]  So why not just Democrats saying they want to take control of the military against us.
[00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:04.590]  Martial law.
[00:40:05.892 --> 00:40:10.375]  A coup is when the rightfully elected president has the military used against him.
[00:40:10.395 --> 00:40:12.277]  That's the perfect definition of a coup.
[00:40:14.155 --> 00:40:17.519]  They had a soft coup in 2020, still in the election.
[00:40:18.059 --> 00:40:19.020]  Now they want to go hot.
[00:40:21.423 --> 00:40:24.025]  Incredibly dangerous.
[00:40:24.066 --> 00:40:24.366]  Here it is.
[00:40:24.386 --> 00:40:26.008]  Trump is a political threat.
[00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:29.672]  And so I mentioned this earlier.
[00:40:29.692 --> 00:40:31.233]  We're going to go through it now.
[00:40:57.463 --> 00:41:01.747]  So let's go ahead and get started on the World War III fight.
[00:41:06.371 --> 00:41:08.693]  But before I do that, I want to talk to listeners for a minute.
[00:41:10.635 --> 00:41:11.415]  I trust in God.
[00:41:11.675 --> 00:41:12.776]  God has always come through.
[00:41:15.038 --> 00:41:20.944]  When the worst things happen to me, I've always learned that if I'm just steadfast and thank God that God makes it way better.
[00:41:21.644 --> 00:41:23.206]  For not just me, but it helps other people.
[00:41:24.178 --> 00:41:26.620]  So I really have beyond faith.
[00:41:27.161 --> 00:41:29.002]  People hear the word faith, it means, oh, you believe something.
[00:41:29.042 --> 00:41:29.543]  No, I know it.
[00:41:30.884 --> 00:41:38.711]  And so if I got killed today or grabbed and tortured and I'm in a jail cell somewhere and my teeth are knocked out, I'm going to be saying, thank you, Jesus.
[00:41:38.771 --> 00:41:42.033]  This boy, we're about to see some big victories.
[00:41:42.674 --> 00:41:47.158]  Every time we get persecuted, every time we go through the fire, we get stronger.
[00:41:49.246 --> 00:41:50.806]  And Christ is the ultimate example of that.
[00:41:50.846 --> 00:41:51.967]  I knew exactly what he was doing.
[00:41:52.247 --> 00:41:57.408]  And even though he was God in the flesh, he still had all the desires and all the human weaknesses.
[00:41:58.568 --> 00:42:02.850]  And he cried in the Garden of Gethsemane hours before they came and arrested him.
[00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:04.150]  Because he was omnipresent.
[00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:04.990]  He knew what they were going to do.
[00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:07.711]  He knew they were going to rip the flesh completely off his back.
[00:42:08.717 --> 00:42:13.880]  And torture him and put a crown of thorns on him and hang him up on a cross and make him suffocate in incredible pain.
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:14.821]  He saw it all.
[00:42:14.861 --> 00:42:22.465]  But more importantly, that all the sins of the world, something God doesn't want to be associated with or around, as I said, God pulls back.
[00:42:24.266 --> 00:42:26.708]  God doesn't like to touch evil.
[00:42:26.788 --> 00:42:30.650]  But in Christ, God said, I'm not going to ask you to do something I can't do.
[00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:36.694]  I am going to take on all the sins previously, the current sins and the future sins as a sacrifice.
[00:42:37.782 --> 00:42:42.645]  And I am going to be there, and I am going to judge myself.
[00:42:42.785 --> 00:42:51.051]  I am going to witness every rape and murder of a child, every war, every person being starved to death, every person being tortured, everybody being abandoned.
[00:42:53.132 --> 00:42:56.014]  All the pain of the universe, I'm going to take it.
[00:42:58.275 --> 00:43:05.460]  Because God's perfect and pure, and only by God transmuting all that evil could God then give us a chance at
[00:43:07.324 --> 00:43:07.764]  Infinity.
[00:43:10.667 --> 00:43:11.828]  And by chance, we have to choose it.
[00:43:11.908 --> 00:43:12.669]  I'm going back to preaching.
[00:43:12.709 --> 00:43:15.471]  I'm going to stop in a moment, but World War III will always make you preach.
[00:43:17.753 --> 00:43:18.774]  And that's really it, folks.
[00:43:18.814 --> 00:43:19.415]  That's it.
[00:43:19.996 --> 00:43:24.860]  God cannot allow evil things into his system, but he has to get you through free will to do it.
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:28.763]  But you're fallen, so God says, all right, I'll take it on.
[00:43:29.604 --> 00:43:33.568]  And then I will transmute it, like lead to gold.
[00:43:35.546 --> 00:43:37.127]  I can't ask you to do things I won't do.
[00:43:37.467 --> 00:43:38.247]  I will do it.
[00:43:39.067 --> 00:43:39.448]  Wow.
[00:43:41.068 --> 00:43:42.449]  That's a big God.
[00:43:43.389 --> 00:43:47.290]  Created the whole universe, everything in it, knows everything, but God doesn't want robots.
[00:43:49.031 --> 00:43:57.154]  God wants free creatures that can see the universe and commune with Him and worship Him and interface with God.
[00:44:00.035 --> 00:44:00.516]  Think about that.
[00:44:01.836 --> 00:44:02.516]  But I'm digressing.
[00:44:03.157 --> 00:44:04.217]  Let me get to the World War III news.
[00:44:08.699 --> 00:44:09.960]  See, I don't script this show.
[00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:12.122]  I mean, I have stuff I want to cover, but I don't script what I'm about to say.
[00:44:12.142 --> 00:44:14.044]  I just go with the knowledge and the information.
[00:44:14.764 --> 00:44:19.608]  And so I was about to tell you that I need your support, but I was thinking, I'm not going to sit here and yell and scream.
[00:44:19.628 --> 00:44:20.649]  I'm not going to sit here and beg you.
[00:44:20.689 --> 00:44:24.952]  I'm not going to sit here and explain to you how important it is, plus they're great products that will enrich your life that you really need.
[00:44:25.353 --> 00:44:26.474]  I'm just going to tell you straight up.
[00:44:27.759 --> 00:44:40.284]  I can't keep this operation going that's having such spectacular success, all praise to God, and then working through you, all the praise to you, after God, all the earthly praise to you, the listeners and viewers.
[00:44:40.564 --> 00:44:41.764]  We were worth it for you to support us.
[00:44:43.865 --> 00:44:45.345]  We do a lot of pretty good work here.
[00:44:45.365 --> 00:44:48.346]  Even when we were being censored massively, we were having a massive effect.
[00:44:49.207 --> 00:44:53.268]  Now, it's ten times what we were having just a few months ago.
[00:44:53.728 --> 00:44:55.209]  It's devastating to the enemy.
[00:44:56.661 --> 00:45:13.991]  So, for me, it's such an easy decision to make for all these new listeners and all these people to just go to mfullmorestore.com and get a t-shirt, get a book, get a film, get a water filtration system, super high-rated, lowest cost for a high-rated system you're going to find.
[00:45:14.491 --> 00:45:18.373]  There's a lot of amazing things at mfullmorestore.com, in stock, ready to ship.
[00:45:19.714 --> 00:45:23.256]  And we can continue this operation.
[00:45:24.909 --> 00:45:27.430]  I know most listeners already know this, but some of you don't.
[00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:28.790]  We have a lot of listeners.
[00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:29.450]  I'm going to explain it.
[00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:33.011]  Everybody's probably heard I'm in bankruptcy, personal and corporate.
[00:45:33.811 --> 00:45:35.411]  And the media said I'd be shut down a year ago.
[00:45:35.451 --> 00:45:36.531]  And I told you it's not true.
[00:45:36.571 --> 00:45:37.372]  We don't have hidden money.
[00:45:37.392 --> 00:45:39.052]  We're not going to jail once they set us up.
[00:45:39.132 --> 00:45:42.072]  And the truth will all come out that I don't have anything.
[00:45:43.873 --> 00:45:51.234]  But the judge up front bought them saying I had $400 million and let them put three outside investigative groups on us.
[00:45:51.714 --> 00:45:54.015]  And they spent over a million bucks investigating his court order.
[00:45:55.868 --> 00:46:00.129]  And of course it came out that I was telling the whole truth, the absolute truth, so help me God.
[00:46:00.729 --> 00:46:05.010]  And so now they've run headlines saying Jones has no money, ha ha ha, well where'd all the hidden money go?
[00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:07.170]  Why aren't, you know, again.
[00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:14.612]  But the judge said I've got to pay half the legal bills, which this thing's coming to an end in the next few months.
[00:46:15.352 --> 00:46:17.192]  It's going through, free speech will stay on air.
[00:46:17.572 --> 00:46:22.373]  Free speech has enough money to operate, not really to expand, so it's great to buy the products at Inflowrestore.com.
[00:46:23.594 --> 00:46:24.234]  But I,
[00:46:25.222 --> 00:46:29.546]  Have been saddled by the judge's decision over a year ago to pay half the legal bills.
[00:46:29.966 --> 00:46:32.429]  I am now $4 million in the hole.
[00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:40.776]  Fighting the establishment that's now spent, last year, $26 million trying to shut us down.
[00:46:41.016 --> 00:46:41.337]  $26 million.
[00:46:41.357 --> 00:46:50.425]  So we have the biggest legal bills ever, but all the experts agree, once this bankruptcy goes through, they'll go down to very, very low, or nothing compared to this couple hundred thousand dollars a year.
[00:46:52.213 --> 00:46:55.816]  So by the grace of God, we're winning the race, but only by a few inches.
[00:46:56.776 --> 00:46:57.777]  So it's very simple.
[00:46:58.277 --> 00:47:09.645]  Here are the products that when you buy them, the court allows me, because I paid for them up front, and because it's my book, I'm allowed to have some of the money to pay the bills.
[00:47:11.486 --> 00:47:16.690]  So you see this headline, Jones spending millions of dollars, yeah, to pay lawyers.
[00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:18.391]  And so,
[00:47:20.448 --> 00:47:25.309]  I don't know what's going to happen if I lose my legal representation because they haven't been paid in almost a year.
[00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:39.232]  But they believe that the court's going to come to it, you know, the understanding, I don't want to say senses, but understanding, and because they've been given the affidavits, the bank accounts, the tax returns, the judge knows I don't have anything.
[00:47:40.572 --> 00:47:44.233]  So I don't think it's a cruel joke that the judge is making me pay the bills around here when I don't have any money.
[00:47:45.313 --> 00:47:47.814]  So that's where we're at.
[00:47:48.874 --> 00:48:00.306]  So I need people to go to Infowarsstore.com and I need folks to get my book, the signed copy of The Great Awakening, because I get a large percentage of that money.
[00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:06.053]  I get half the money from the book sales on the unsigned and on the signed.
[00:48:07.014 --> 00:48:08.716]  And then it goes right into this.
[00:48:08.756 --> 00:48:10.137]  And we're right here at the finish line.
[00:48:10.157 --> 00:48:10.638]  We're winning.
[00:48:12.352 --> 00:48:15.773]  And it's $100 to get the signed book because it's a fundraiser.
[00:48:15.833 --> 00:48:18.153]  It's like on NPR where they sell a coffee mug for $100.
[00:48:18.653 --> 00:48:26.734]  Well, it didn't cost them $100, it cost them $5 or $6, but it's a pledge and it lets you know, hey, you helped keep, you know, their communist garbage on air along with taxpayer money.
[00:48:27.095 --> 00:48:29.295]  Well, we don't get taxpayer money like NPR or PBS.
[00:48:29.495 --> 00:48:30.295]  We're funded by you.
[00:48:31.875 --> 00:48:39.917]  So I simply need you to go to Infowarsstore.com and get the signed or unsigned book if you want to keep me on the air.
[00:48:40.557 --> 00:48:40.837]  Okay?
[00:48:40.977 --> 00:48:41.497]  It's that simple.
[00:48:42.959 --> 00:48:55.845]  And I'm not a quitter, you know, I'm really at this point, I've not even been pushing this a lot and asking you to support me a lot because I'm kind of like, hey God, you know, if you want to keep me on air, have a donor give me the money or just something so I don't have, because I don't want to just spend the whole show begging here.
[00:48:56.525 --> 00:49:01.727]  But then I start thinking, well, that's kind of quitting if you don't do it, so I guess I'll, you know, go to the audience.
[00:49:01.787 --> 00:49:03.068]  I'm not going to second guess God.
[00:49:03.888 --> 00:49:05.289]  But it's real simple.
[00:49:06.769 --> 00:49:11.311]  You can also go to www.DefendJones.com, make a straight donation for my legal bills and other expenses.
[00:49:11.331 --> 00:49:12.612]  www.DefendJones.com.

[00:49:15.373 --> 00:49:17.154]  www.DefendJones.com.

[00:49:41.906 --> 00:49:49.510]  I want to get into the big world war news here, but I just want to remind listeners that that's what's going on at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:57.394]  Get the book, get the InfoWars Platinum products, and those are the things that support what I'm doing here.
[00:49:58.095 --> 00:50:02.057]  Also, a great sponsor of the show and the fight here is my dad.
[00:50:03.172 --> 00:50:08.094]  And they've sued him and he spent over a million dollars and of course everything he said was true.
[00:50:08.114 --> 00:50:10.295]  There wasn't any hidden money and they've got egg on their face.
[00:50:10.395 --> 00:50:19.119]  My dad has basically been run to ground and is basically out of money and they're still coming after him and the harassment.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.460]  Well he has DrJonesNaturals.com.
[00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:23.081]  DrJonesNaturals.com.

[00:51:04.996 --> 00:51:07.398]  It really is a great site, and he's also a sponsor.

[00:51:09.535 --> 00:51:16.941]  He supports us and you get great products at the same time at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:51:16.981 --> 00:51:29.171]  We are going to now segue into the war news.
[00:51:38.976 --> 00:51:40.818]  Man, I really don't even know what to say at this point.
[00:51:41.459 --> 00:51:56.996]  I, uh... Look, I want to explain something to people, okay?
[00:51:58.958 --> 00:52:00.480]  The party's over, alright?
[00:52:06.670 --> 00:52:24.524]  If you go to my ex-account, Real Alex Jones, we can pull up the video that I posted there today of people already going days before, I guess, into the football stadium where some of these NFL teams are about to play.
[00:52:25.404 --> 00:52:32.630]  And there's such a blizzard that they say, you're not even going to have assigned seats, just sit wherever you can.
[00:52:34.515 --> 00:52:36.396]  And you say, what does this have to do with World War III?
[00:52:38.156 --> 00:52:53.340]  Well, there you got a father, and he thinks the most manly thing he can do and the most American thing he can do is dress his sons up in a football jersey, in a tribal outfit, and then go watch the game.
[00:52:56.621 --> 00:52:58.202]  And I'm not saying he's a bad dad.
[00:52:58.702 --> 00:53:02.303]  My dad took me to football games when it was snowing, and I liked them.
[00:53:03.942 --> 00:53:08.224]  And he'd get me a hot dog and Coca-Cola and nachos.
[00:53:08.284 --> 00:53:11.846]  And by the time I was about 10, you know, he'd slip me a beer.
[00:53:14.027 --> 00:53:14.568]  That was fun.
[00:53:15.608 --> 00:53:17.169]  Drink a couple beers with dad.
[00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:35.433]  But the point is, is that if you were driving to the football game and you heard, grandma just had a heart attack and is in the hospital and she lives in your town, would you still go to the game?
[00:53:36.373 --> 00:53:42.495]  Or how about you're driving home and you hear your 15 year old daughter was just in a car wreck five miles away.
[00:53:42.795 --> 00:53:44.176]  Would you still go to the game?
[00:53:46.136 --> 00:53:52.138]  You see, we're not going to turn this stuff around until we have priorities.
[00:53:55.615 --> 00:53:59.416]  And people don't have the priorities anymore.
[00:53:59.437 --> 00:54:03.678]  Oh, there's massive human trapping and hundreds of thousands of fentanyl deaths and all these wars.
[00:54:04.659 --> 00:54:11.561]  Still, if you go to that football game, most of those guys are probably conservative and hardworking and, you know, vote good and everything.
[00:54:11.621 --> 00:54:13.862]  But they'll say, hey, man, I work hard.
[00:54:13.942 --> 00:54:16.523]  I deserve to have some fun and see a football game.
[00:54:16.723 --> 00:54:17.664]  And I'm not saying you don't.
[00:54:19.684 --> 00:54:20.945]  But what I'm telling you is,
[00:54:23.843 --> 00:54:50.130]  That at what point do you realize that if you're not spending a large part of your time supporting political resistance to the globalists, going to church with your children, talking to your neighbors, calling into talk shows, filing lawsuits, running for school board, going to the border as a citizen journalist to show what's happening, all of us together are going to have to prioritize the fact that
[00:54:54.605 --> 00:55:18.017]  We're in a lot of trouble and our freedoms are being taken fast now and we're headlong going into a shibble war race war and I get calls all the time by really cool people and say hey go out to dinner with us tonight or go jump on an airplane with us and you know we're flying picking up the private jet let's go have a couple days and have some fun together and you'll play poker or hey man come out to my comedy club tonight
[00:55:19.861 --> 00:55:28.807]  And I just say to him now, and maybe I'm wrong, maybe something's wrong with me, I just say, you know, I gotta get to bed early, because I gotta get up real early and study about what's going on.
[00:55:29.167 --> 00:55:39.594]  I just, and I'm not saying it's bad to have some R&R, I'm not saying it's bad, and maybe I'm the extreme, where I fight the New World Order 95% of the time, even when I sleep, I have dreams about it.
[00:55:40.554 --> 00:55:48.840]  I still have some pleasure, I still watch an occasional movie, and I sure like sex with my wife, that's, I'm certainly not skipping out on that.
[00:55:50.092 --> 00:55:51.653]  That's something God gave us that's enjoyable.
[00:55:52.114 --> 00:55:56.017]  I like food, but it's all I do.
[00:55:56.917 --> 00:56:03.242]  So you can say I'm on one end of the spectrum, but no, man, I'm not going to stand in line at Disney World.
[00:56:03.663 --> 00:56:05.504]  I'm not going to stand in line at a rock concert.
[00:56:05.764 --> 00:56:18.214]  I'm not going to some football game and having them pat me down and go sit there and buy $10 beers and $20 nachos and then watch a bunch of spoiled, brat, rotten football players run around on the field.
[00:56:18.634 --> 00:56:19.455]  And I'm just not doing it.
[00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:26.714]  So, everybody, you just go ahead and go to the Roman Colosseum while the barbarians are 10 miles away about to burn the city.
[00:56:28.395 --> 00:56:35.320]  Me, I'm trying to raise a defense of the city, and at the last minute I see, I guess, you're not going to stand up with me.
[00:56:37.462 --> 00:56:41.905]  Well, I won't be able to flee the city because I didn't make any preparations for that, because I'm going to go down with a ship.
[00:56:42.585 --> 00:56:43.986]  And that means my family and everybody else.
[00:56:46.172 --> 00:56:50.533]  You got people like me that work on this all the time, because it's all I can do knowing this.
[00:56:50.593 --> 00:56:51.533]  It's not like it's even work.
[00:56:52.373 --> 00:56:53.594]  Wild horses can't drag me away.
[00:56:53.834 --> 00:56:58.275]  You got people in the middle that are like, yeah, they know something's going on, but they're a little too busy to really do much.
[00:56:58.295 --> 00:57:00.915]  Maybe they say something occasionally online about freedom.
[00:57:02.756 --> 00:57:09.057]  And then you got people on the other side that love all the evil and just absolutely can't wait to run your life completely.
[00:57:09.077 --> 00:57:15.579]  Because if you think they're running your life now, if you think you're getting controlled now, if you think things are screwed up now, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:57:17.267 --> 00:57:21.130]  So as for me, when somebody's on top of me, beating the living hell out of me, I'm going to try to get them off of me.
[00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:25.933]  I'm not going to like, well, while you're beating me and stabbing me, I'm going to get on my phone and watch a football game.
[00:57:26.454 --> 00:57:27.815]  No, I'm going to get you off my ass.
[00:57:28.315 --> 00:57:29.716]  Then once everything's fixed, I might go.
[00:57:31.197 --> 00:57:36.641]  Once we arrest the globalists and turn things around and stop World War III, maybe I'll go get season tickets to the Cowboys.
[00:57:37.802 --> 00:57:39.283]  But I'm not doing it until we save things.
[00:57:39.303 --> 00:57:39.783]  You understand that?
[00:57:40.484 --> 00:57:41.224]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:41.264 --> 00:57:42.365]  I'll get into the World War III news.
[00:57:42.385 --> 00:57:43.506]  Special guest in studio, stay with us.
[00:57:49.997 --> 00:57:55.902]  We started producing over two years ago with a top independent video game maker, New World Wars.
[00:57:56.762 --> 00:58:03.007]  And it got behind, we added a lot of stuff to it, we up-edited it, it's already a hit game, people love it, we put it out on AlexJonesGame.com.
[00:58:03.548 --> 00:58:16.458]  Then, Steam waited months, the number one online video game platform, to approve it, and they approved it a week ago, and it went live yesterday, right when the Jeffrey Epstein list broke, and it was the top story in the world.
[00:58:16.978 --> 00:58:18.780]  That is God's hand on this.
[00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:22.444]  So as Garth Brooks says, some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers.
[00:58:22.744 --> 00:58:26.448]  I wanted this out a year ago, but it came out with perfect timing.
[00:58:26.709 --> 00:58:27.670]  It's an incredible game.
[00:58:27.970 --> 00:58:28.591]  People love it.
[00:58:28.651 --> 00:58:30.232]  It's got a voiceover I did for it.
[00:58:30.673 --> 00:58:31.334]  It's amazing.
[00:58:31.394 --> 00:58:32.895]  Get it at AlexJonesGame.com.
[00:58:33.176 --> 00:58:36.099]  You play it there on the site, but click on the link to Steam.
[00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:40.567]  So you can go to their site and get it and download it to all your devices.
[00:58:40.667 --> 00:58:42.931]  Get it at Steam right now.
[00:58:42.971 --> 00:58:46.918]  We'll put links on the screen and under it below right here at mfulworths.com.
[00:58:47.199 --> 00:58:48.080]  Get the video game.
[00:58:48.241 --> 00:58:48.802]  Change the world.
[00:58:49.790 --> 00:58:53.512]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[00:58:53.833 --> 00:58:56.995]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[00:58:57.395 --> 00:59:01.878]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[00:59:02.498 --> 00:59:04.620]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:12.925]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs.
[00:59:13.546 --> 00:59:14.867]  This is the Great Awakening.
[00:59:15.367 --> 00:59:19.292]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[00:59:19.752 --> 00:59:21.234]  It's a companion to my last book.
[00:59:21.535 --> 00:59:26.080]  It was a number one worldwide bestseller and this book is even thicker and even more powerful.
[00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:30.265]  Get your copy of The Great Awakening today at InfoWarstore.com.
[00:59:30.265 --> 00:59:30.805]  We're good to go.
[01:00:01.257 --> 01:00:03.518]  The program leftists failed to silence.
[01:00:04.098 --> 01:00:05.799]  It's the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:13.321]  What's the carbon footprint of these events every single year that you come here?
[01:00:13.341 --> 01:00:15.622]  Do you think it's worth it?
[01:00:15.642 --> 01:00:17.823]  Do peasants pay for your crimes?
[01:00:20.243 --> 01:00:21.324]  That's a stupid question.
[01:00:21.484 --> 01:00:22.804]  Is it really?
[01:00:22.824 --> 01:00:26.405]  Is it more stupid than you travelling here to tell us?
[01:00:26.425 --> 01:00:29.927]  Sorry?
[01:00:32.034 --> 01:00:32.635]  We're done.
[01:00:32.655 --> 01:00:34.016]  We are done now.
[01:00:34.997 --> 01:00:35.777]  Don't grab me.
[01:00:36.578 --> 01:00:37.359]  You can't grab us.
[01:00:37.379 --> 01:00:39.240]  This is a free society, mate.
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.361]  We have freedom of the press.
[01:00:41.582 --> 01:00:43.104]  Why do you think you're more important?
[01:00:43.424 --> 01:00:48.148]  Your carbon footprint doesn't matter, but everybody else around the world... Nobody ever suggested that.
[01:00:48.769 --> 01:00:50.270]  Nobody ever suggested that.
[01:00:50.310 --> 01:00:51.871]  Don't make up stupid questions.
[01:00:52.232 --> 01:00:53.793]  You being here suggests that.
[01:00:54.234 --> 01:00:57.857]  You being here every single year and doing this suggests that.
[01:00:58.909 --> 01:01:02.672]  And I have done a huge amount to reduce emissions.
[01:01:02.752 --> 01:01:04.112]  Why can't I ask him questions?
[01:01:04.673 --> 01:01:05.153]  Who are you?
[01:01:06.154 --> 01:01:07.775]  Why are you trying to bully me out of asking?
[01:01:09.216 --> 01:01:13.118]  A lot of people say no to a lot of the policies and agendas he pushes.
[01:01:14.339 --> 01:01:17.961]  They don't get a choice, so why can't we ask him a question in a public space?
[01:01:18.361 --> 01:01:19.162]  Can you not touch me?
[01:01:19.182 --> 01:01:21.143]  Can you not touch me?
[01:01:24.425 --> 01:01:25.365]  No, I'm happy.
[01:01:30.318 --> 01:01:32.020]  Wait.
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:32.801]  Sir, answer.
[01:01:32.861 --> 01:01:33.741]  We can walk nicely.
[01:01:33.781 --> 01:01:34.802]  I answered your question.
[01:01:35.383 --> 01:01:36.083]  What did you answer?
[01:01:36.103 --> 01:01:38.125]  Please, sir, I said I didn't know.
[01:01:39.746 --> 01:01:40.267]  I don't know.
[01:01:40.907 --> 01:01:41.568]  Sir, sir.
[01:01:42.208 --> 01:01:44.670]  Listen, I... That's alright.
[01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:46.151]  We're walking to the meeting.
[01:01:47.032 --> 01:01:47.893]  Okay, thanks.
[01:01:47.913 --> 01:01:51.336]  Why are you working so hard to protect such a criminal?
[01:01:52.957 --> 01:01:53.517]  That's right.
[01:01:53.618 --> 01:01:54.058]  Criminals.
[01:01:54.098 --> 01:01:55.639]  Why are you protecting criminals?
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:57.461]  There you go.
[01:02:02.056 --> 01:02:02.797]  Well there you have it.
[01:02:03.037 --> 01:02:11.946]  When they can't answer the questions, the simple questions that most people around the world, the average Joe is asking, they get their goons in to end the interview.
[01:02:11.986 --> 01:02:16.310]  Because they're not used to independent journalists here in their safe space.
[01:02:17.625 --> 01:02:18.545]  How are you doing Jonathan?
[01:02:18.565 --> 01:02:19.246]  I'm good.
[01:02:19.366 --> 01:02:20.426]  Can I ask you something?
[01:02:20.446 --> 01:02:21.227]  I'm meeting somebody, I'm sorry.
[01:02:21.307 --> 01:02:21.967]  I'll walk with you.
[01:02:22.087 --> 01:02:24.568]  Are you like the boy who cried wolf?
[01:02:24.948 --> 01:02:25.168]  Are you?
[01:02:25.188 --> 01:02:34.732]  For so many years you cried anti-semitism and you found hatred everywhere and then finally... I'll be meeting you from Rebel News.
[01:02:34.772 --> 01:02:35.472]  What's Rebel News?
[01:02:35.532 --> 01:02:36.853]  Rebel News.
[01:02:36.873 --> 01:02:45.457]  It doesn't matter, but finally now when the world has turned so anti-semitic, no one believes us because of people like you and the work you've done over so many years.
[01:02:46.621 --> 01:02:50.642]  Destroying our allies, making lists about our allies, people that actually defend us.
[01:02:51.402 --> 01:02:53.582]  You've been a big part of that problem, haven't you?
[01:02:53.602 --> 01:02:57.323]  Do you know the boy that cried wolf?
[01:02:57.663 --> 01:03:00.524]  I'm not familiar with this story, why don't you explain it to me?
[01:03:00.544 --> 01:03:07.045]  Jonathan, it's not a joke because the Jews around the world, we are feeling the pain and you've alienated so many of our allies.
[01:03:07.405 --> 01:03:08.365]  What about Elon Musk?
[01:03:08.725 --> 01:03:09.806]  Somebody that's been so good?
[01:03:10.506 --> 01:03:11.506]  No, you got a message for Elon?
[01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:13.922]  Thank you Jonathan.
[01:03:13.942 --> 01:03:15.044]  There you go.
[01:03:15.685 --> 01:03:16.307]  Nothing to say.
[01:03:17.249 --> 01:03:18.391]  Censorship in real life.
[01:03:18.411 --> 01:03:20.816]  I bet you I'm going to be on a list tomorrow.
[01:03:22.025 --> 01:03:26.688]  Jonathan Grimblatt is a man that has cried anti-semitism for years.
[01:03:26.868 --> 01:03:33.852]  He has found hate, he has made it his job to find hate and anti-semitism and Jew hatred where it hasn't been.
[01:03:34.632 --> 01:03:50.222]  Now, the problem with that is, fast forward to October 7, where many of us Jews are finally seeing real anti-semitism, but so much of the world is numb to it and don't believe it because he's cried it for so many years.
[01:03:50.782 --> 01:04:03.605]  The Jonathan Grimblatt of the world who label anyone with an opposing view as a racist and as anti-Semite and now suddenly in our darkest days we have no one left to support us.
[01:04:04.066 --> 01:04:04.966]  That is why we're here.
[01:04:05.406 --> 01:04:06.886]  WEFReports.com.
[01:04:07.186 --> 01:04:08.967]  Bookmark and support our work.
[01:04:10.807 --> 01:04:12.208]  Yavi Amini has been on the show before.
[01:04:12.228 --> 01:04:12.988]  I want to get him back on.
[01:04:13.028 --> 01:04:19.770]  He's at Debo's doing an incredible job at the Rebel News which is a lot of great people but also has some really great smart
[01:04:20.768 --> 01:04:24.251]  Jews working there that get what's going on and understand.
[01:04:24.831 --> 01:04:31.016]  Greenblatt's job for the left is to go out and create anti-Semitism so that they get more funds.
[01:04:31.817 --> 01:04:35.400]  Meanwhile, he supports the whole Islamic invasion and the rest of it.
[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:40.804]  Of course, Antifa was also there supporting the WAF because they support the establishment.
[01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:44.267]  This is disgusting and it's sick.
[01:04:45.928 --> 01:04:46.929]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:53.811]  We'll be right back with the World War Three news and a lot more.
[01:05:00.232 --> 01:05:04.373]  You know, I sit up here and I yell and scream about the new world order and the globalists.
[01:05:04.393 --> 01:05:08.514]  They're planning to get rid of the borders and release a virus and have a global power grab.
[01:05:08.554 --> 01:05:09.574]  And you saw it all come true.
[01:05:10.695 --> 01:05:11.475]  But there's a
[01:05:12.586 --> 01:05:13.367]  Inverse of that.
[01:05:14.107 --> 01:05:19.091]  There's not just the bad stuff I'm telling you about, there's the good stuff I'm telling you about.
[01:05:19.851 --> 01:05:24.495]  And just like our information is the best you're going to find out there, our supplements are amazing.
[01:05:25.135 --> 01:05:28.898]  So our new special in the last half of January 2024 is here.
[01:05:29.418 --> 01:05:33.761]  It's Real Red Pill Plus and DNA Force Plus, both 50% off.
[01:05:33.922 --> 01:05:37.004]  We're calling it the Supercharged Special.
[01:05:37.664 --> 01:05:42.929]  You can get either one of these great items at 40% off individually or together for 50% off.
[01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:47.694]  Now, in the time we have left, I can't tell you why they're so great and what they do for your body.
[01:05:48.114 --> 01:05:52.839]  Go to InfoWarstore.com, look at the ingredients and investigate it, and then get them.
[01:05:53.139 --> 01:05:55.641]  It supports the InfoWar and it'll change your life.
[01:05:56.222 --> 01:05:57.023]  Take advantage now.
[01:05:57.183 --> 01:05:57.924]  InfoWarstore.com.
[01:06:03.015 --> 01:06:07.017]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:06:07.377 --> 01:06:21.324]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:21.344 --> 01:06:23.645]  We cannot have a major nuclear war.
[01:06:23.825 --> 01:06:25.006]  Every expert agrees.
[01:06:25.146 --> 01:06:27.187]  Every analysis concurs.
[01:06:27.327 --> 01:06:28.508]  Every war game proves.
[01:06:30.512 --> 01:06:35.215]  That it will quickly descend into nuclear, chemical, biological, cyber attacks.
[01:06:37.957 --> 01:06:40.239]  And there are no winners in this situation.
[01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:46.062]  And all the policies that were clear-headed by the U.S.
[01:06:46.102 --> 01:06:51.206]  government and others are now being disregarded on the RAND Corporation's threat continuum ladder.
[01:06:51.966 --> 01:06:54.248]  And we are quickly marching towards Armageddon.
[01:06:55.229 --> 01:06:56.369]  And now this has happened.
[01:06:57.610 --> 01:06:58.511]  Overhead shot, please.
[01:06:59.946 --> 01:07:03.267]  Big article on Infowars.com linking to the biggest newspapers in Germany.
[01:07:03.307 --> 01:07:09.109]  Now reporting on this leaked German military document that tells countdown to World War III.
[01:07:10.349 --> 01:07:19.812]  The German military is apparently preparing for an attack by Russians following the 2024 election that may escalate into a wider global conflict.
[01:07:20.717 --> 01:07:35.067]  A classified Berlin Ministry of Defense document obtained by Build newspaper called the Alliance Defense 2025 details a timeline of us cutting conflict with Russia following a hybrid attack on NATO's eastern flank.
[01:07:35.627 --> 01:07:40.911]  So just like Sweden with no evidence of predicting Russia will invade and attack Western Europe.
[01:07:42.005 --> 01:07:52.322]  According to the training scenario documents, the Bundeswehr, German armed forces, are preparing for a Russian attack on Eastern Europe this February.
[01:07:53.144 --> 01:07:53.564]  Next month.
[01:07:54.670 --> 01:08:07.616]  The document claims the United States, financially for Ukraine, drying up, will embolden Russia to modernize and mobilize 200,000 troops and launch a spring offensive against Ukraine forces in tandem with severe cyber attacks.
[01:08:07.696 --> 01:08:08.577]  Perfect false flag.
[01:08:08.817 --> 01:08:10.097]  They've been pre-programming that's coming.
[01:08:10.557 --> 01:08:12.418]  And claiming Trump supporters will be involved with Russia.
[01:08:12.698 --> 01:08:13.259]  Total crap.
[01:08:14.008 --> 01:08:14.848]  We tell you this is coming.
[01:08:15.448 --> 01:08:24.491]  From there, the document lays out how the conflict will escalate month by month, culminating in a direct confrontation between Western systems and Russian forces.
[01:08:26.471 --> 01:08:28.252]  And it goes on from there.
[01:08:28.312 --> 01:08:31.653]  You might want to read the report for yourself.
[01:08:32.433 --> 01:08:38.855]  And then you add that to Sweden's defense minister last week publicly saying, go out, get fuel, get water, get canned goods.
[01:08:39.535 --> 01:08:40.915]  War with Russia is imminent.
[01:08:40.975 --> 01:08:42.376]  Sweden's not been in a war in over 200 years.
[01:08:44.224 --> 01:08:46.906]  But let me tell you who you can expect to launch offensive war.
[01:08:47.287 --> 01:08:52.571]  They're already doing it all over the South China Sea, as far south as southern Vietnam.
[01:08:52.952 --> 01:09:03.481]  I know it's one country now, but the southern areas of Vietnam, and out into the areas around the Philippines, and then up to the north around Japan.
[01:09:04.562 --> 01:09:07.885]  Xi Jinping is purging the military massively, and admitting he is.
[01:09:09.059 --> 01:09:14.501]  And putting in generals who then say prepare for war and that war is literally imminent.
[01:09:14.841 --> 01:09:20.443]  Ladies and gentlemen, Xi Jinping fighting with China's own military could lead to war.
[01:09:20.483 --> 01:09:27.506]  Business Insider, the Times of India, the Chinese newspapers are all reporting this.
[01:09:27.646 --> 01:09:33.469]  Xi is purging the military and putting people in that are ready for total war.
[01:09:33.529 --> 01:09:36.730]  Now you've seen the announcements of total war.
[01:09:38.823 --> 01:09:48.245]  The British Defense Department spokesperson, Ministry of Defense, says Britain facing wars in Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and says we're already on a pre-war phase.
[01:09:52.406 --> 01:09:55.467]  Another report that I'm going to air that's, I think, really good.
[01:09:55.507 --> 01:09:57.848]  I let it all out very calmly, very succinctly.
[01:09:59.108 --> 01:10:03.469]  In 23 minutes, I'm going to air it at the end of the third hour coming up.
[01:10:03.569 --> 01:10:06.070]  Globalists lack supporters, but they have nukes.
[01:10:07.597 --> 01:10:09.198]  Alex Jones tells RT.
[01:10:10.379 --> 01:10:14.923]  So that is all coming up.
[01:10:15.603 --> 01:10:18.685]  And then you dovetail that with the left saying race war is imminent.
[01:10:19.206 --> 01:10:22.348]  Trump is going to be a dictator, so we've got to take control of the military.
[01:10:22.929 --> 01:10:33.717]  If he's elected and already have legislation prepared, they want to pass in the next 10 months before they say Trump will win, in the next 12 months before he goes into office on January 20th, 2025.
[01:10:35.874 --> 01:10:41.799]  So, they need a military coup, that's grabbing control of the military, to stop Trump from a coup.
[01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:46.403]  Absolute gaslighting, total inversion, upside down land.
[01:10:49.185 --> 01:10:50.186]  Extremely dangerous.
[01:10:52.207 --> 01:10:53.048]  They are not giving up.
[01:10:54.329 --> 01:10:55.410]  They are not going away.
[01:10:56.951 --> 01:11:00.334]  They intend for all of this to happen because I played this clip yesterday and I want to play it again.
[01:11:01.475 --> 01:11:03.437]  It's Yuval Noah Harari saying,
[01:11:05.563 --> 01:11:10.788]  That a Trump win will be a death blow to global order.
[01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:19.255]  And he means the quote, rules-based system, they call it, where they have no rules and can human traffic, launch wars, whoever they want.
[01:11:20.436 --> 01:11:22.538]  So yes, Trump is a realist.
[01:11:22.618 --> 01:11:26.361]  He wants prosperity.
[01:11:27.282 --> 01:11:27.923]  He wants freedom.
[01:11:29.775 --> 01:11:33.817]  He doesn't want to be in a war economy, but the German government and the British government, the U.S.
[01:11:33.857 --> 01:11:39.819]  government, their internal and external reports are all saying we're going into a full war economy.
[01:11:39.859 --> 01:11:53.744]  In fact, NATO officially said two weeks ago, it was in late December, so more like three weeks ago, they said you're not going to be able to go on vacation, you're not going to have energy, you're not going to be able to do any of that.
[01:11:55.265 --> 01:12:14.728]  From now on, you'll be able to take a shower once a week, you can only wash your clothes once a week, and now we have all the smart meters, they said we're going to control you, so Germany's going further than China with the smart grid, the social credit score control, because we are going to be in a full permanent war economy.
[01:12:15.909 --> 01:12:23.470]  You know, you read 1984, that was George Orwell's prediction, he'd been high level, OSS, Ministry of Truth, BBC,
[01:12:25.353 --> 01:12:25.913]  We're good to go.
[01:12:47.938 --> 01:12:54.184]  What he believed would happen if the left continued to be in charge, and he'd been the highest level Fabian Socialist you could be.
[01:12:54.604 --> 01:12:55.345]  He was on their board.
[01:12:55.365 --> 01:12:58.508]  And the British Fabian Socialists are behind communism and everything.
[01:12:58.768 --> 01:13:02.091]  And he got in the inner grouping of it, and they told him the secret.
[01:13:02.992 --> 01:13:06.335]  So he wrote 1984 and died a year later, in 1949.
[01:13:08.797 --> 01:13:10.538]  So this is their plan, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:10.899 --> 01:13:12.901]  Absolute domination, absolute enslavement.
[01:13:13.201 --> 01:13:14.182]  Here's Giovanno Arari.
[01:13:15.691 --> 01:13:18.553]  Are you concerned that Trump might be elected again shortly?
[01:13:18.653 --> 01:13:19.613]  I think it's very likely.
[01:13:20.253 --> 01:13:27.837]  And if it happens, it is likely to be the kind of like the death blow to what remains of the global order.
[01:13:29.078 --> 01:13:30.699]  And he says it openly.
[01:13:31.539 --> 01:13:34.401]  It should be clear that many of these politicians
[01:13:36.303 --> 01:13:57.136]  They present a false dichotomy, a false binary vision of the world, as if you have to choose between patriotism and globalism, between being loyal to your nation and being loyal to some kind of, I don't know, global government or whatever.
[01:13:59.177 --> 01:13:59.318]  Oh!
[01:14:00.058 --> 01:14:02.119]  We don't want to be loyal to the global government!
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.361]  The global government will fail
[01:14:06.112 --> 01:14:07.693]  If we don't stop Trump.
[01:14:09.174 --> 01:14:11.296]  And you notice, it's the final nail in the coffin.
[01:14:11.316 --> 01:14:12.917]  He admits they're losing, and they are losing.
[01:14:13.337 --> 01:14:14.878]  And I don't tell this story to impress you.
[01:14:15.259 --> 01:14:16.820]  You're not a public figure, most of you.
[01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:17.781]  That's a good thing.
[01:14:17.841 --> 01:14:18.461]  You're in anonymity.
[01:14:18.481 --> 01:14:19.062]  You're private.
[01:14:19.522 --> 01:14:19.922]  It's great.
[01:14:20.403 --> 01:14:20.763]  I'm not.
[01:14:22.284 --> 01:14:27.988]  And so, I do my own grocery store shopping, my own everything, my own gas pumping.
[01:14:28.048 --> 01:14:28.769]  I'm out there everywhere.
[01:14:29.409 --> 01:14:30.650]  I go around the country, around the world.
[01:14:32.131 --> 01:14:34.373]  I've had like two people in a year and a half confront me.
[01:14:36.098 --> 01:14:37.299]  In the past, it happened every day.
[01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:42.624]  I got mainly love, 20 to 1 love, but I would get attacked every restaurant, almost always.
[01:14:43.985 --> 01:14:45.927]  Coming up, yelling at me at my table, you've seen the videos.
[01:14:46.627 --> 01:14:49.990]  Dumpings, drinks on my head, coffee on my head.
[01:14:53.473 --> 01:14:56.856]  If I'd shake 15, 20, 30 hands, then somebody would take a swing at me.
[01:14:59.218 --> 01:15:00.059]  Year and a half, nothing.
[01:15:02.349 --> 01:15:04.110]  Because people know they're being screwed.
[01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:05.171]  They know they're being enslaved.
[01:15:05.191 --> 01:15:06.491]  And I mentioned the power being cut off.
[01:15:06.831 --> 01:15:07.592]  Germany's announcements.
[01:15:07.932 --> 01:15:10.994]  Look at this headline that we're going to place some important reports to bring our guest in.
[01:15:11.834 --> 01:15:12.514]  Really great guest.
[01:15:13.055 --> 01:15:13.675]  Surprise guest.
[01:15:14.856 --> 01:15:15.716]  This is out of Newsweek.
[01:15:15.776 --> 01:15:20.739]  Texans asked to not use their washing machines as weather tests the grid.
[01:15:24.081 --> 01:15:28.923]  Car ownership unaffordable for majority in new big national study.
[01:15:29.504 --> 01:15:30.724]  The American dream's over, they say.
[01:15:34.059 --> 01:15:34.900]  What's important there?
[01:15:38.244 --> 01:15:40.146]  The last two years, the power went off a bunch.
[01:15:40.166 --> 01:15:41.648]  We had to put a big generator in because of it.
[01:15:43.089 --> 01:15:45.312]  For weeks on end, many people dying.
[01:15:46.373 --> 01:15:55.203]  And it was in the federal and state documents that the Fed said, you cannot up the power output at your coal power and gas power plants because of the carbon.
[01:15:57.076 --> 01:15:58.678]  And the state asked them, let us increase power.
[01:15:58.938 --> 01:16:00.540]  The Feds are in control under U.N.
[01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:01.481]  treaties we never ratified.
[01:16:01.881 --> 01:16:02.962]  Not letting us boost energy.
[01:16:02.982 --> 01:16:05.805]  So they're telling you, don't use your appliances just like Germany is.
[01:16:06.226 --> 01:16:07.066]  It's austerity.
[01:16:07.347 --> 01:16:08.448]  It's climate lockdowns.
[01:16:08.468 --> 01:16:10.410]  And they have these big headlines.
[01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:13.693]  Oh, the Feds didn't order Texas not to up its power.
[01:16:13.934 --> 01:16:14.614]  The hell they didn't.
[01:16:14.654 --> 01:16:15.115]  Look it up.
[01:16:17.517 --> 01:16:19.620]  Oh, because of greenhouse gases.
[01:16:20.882 --> 01:16:24.583]  And then they put electric cars on the grid that use more power than a house uses in a week.
[01:16:24.943 --> 01:16:32.285]  Notice they don't say don't charge your electric cars when they use one charging electric car on average a thousand times what your washing machine.
[01:16:32.425 --> 01:16:32.765]  Look it up.
[01:16:32.985 --> 01:16:36.445]  I mean it's more than a whole house in a week uses to charge a small electric car.
[01:16:36.505 --> 01:16:37.066]  It's a joke.
[01:16:37.946 --> 01:16:45.688]  So they put them on to strain the grid and then tell you that you can't take a hot shower.
[01:16:46.368 --> 01:16:46.948]  And they're banning
[01:16:48.035 --> 01:16:50.796]  Gas-powered water heaters and stoves and everything else.
[01:16:51.576 --> 01:16:53.936]  Remember just a year and a half ago, it was a conspiracy theory?
[01:16:54.116 --> 01:16:55.817]  It was in the federal documents, now it's here.
[01:16:58.657 --> 01:16:59.958]  They're coming for everything, folks.
[01:16:59.978 --> 01:17:01.478]  They're attacking civilization.
[01:17:02.158 --> 01:17:04.079]  They're creating destabilization.
[01:17:04.099 --> 01:17:06.779]  All right, we've got our special guest coming in.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.640]  But World War III is the main threat.
[01:17:10.899 --> 01:17:22.126]  They've decided to go with it because out of this world crisis, they'll get their cash flow society, they'll get their chips under the skin, they'll get their forced injections, they'll get their UN treaties, they'll get their social credit scores, they'll get their carbon taxes.
[01:17:22.507 --> 01:17:26.970]  They need this crisis to bring in their world government and make you go out of their control.
[01:17:27.270 --> 01:17:31.953]  But I warn the globalists, and they admit they're losing, this will only make you lose bigger, don't do it.
[01:17:32.233 --> 01:17:37.597]  And if they see a big enough understanding of this in the public, and enough of an ongoing crescendo, a buzz,
[01:17:39.577 --> 01:17:42.439]  Of people being aware of this, they will have to back down.
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:45.461]  So our lives are in our hands.
[01:17:45.921 --> 01:17:47.922]  And that's why this broadcast is so special.
[01:17:47.942 --> 01:17:55.487]  We're going to talk about the economy in an in-depth dive, talk about runs on banks, talk about so much more coming up with a special guest who's really smart in studio.
[01:17:55.988 --> 01:17:57.729]  But first, here is a warning.
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:05.704]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[01:18:06.184 --> 01:18:13.828]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[01:18:14.108 --> 01:18:16.209]  As president, I will make it clear.
[01:18:17.069 --> 01:18:21.792]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[01:18:22.392 --> 01:18:27.755]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[01:18:27.815 --> 01:18:31.156]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[01:18:31.196 --> 01:18:34.178]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[01:18:34.218 --> 01:18:36.779]  We came, we saw, he died.
[01:18:39.187 --> 01:18:41.190]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[01:18:41.570 --> 01:18:45.055]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[01:18:45.236 --> 01:18:53.147]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[01:18:55.051 --> 01:18:55.531]  The U.S.
[01:18:55.571 --> 01:18:59.172]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[01:18:59.533 --> 01:19:07.135]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action, following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[01:19:07.515 --> 01:19:09.856]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[01:19:09.876 --> 01:19:13.077]  Of course not, because she's... Look, there's a really loud noise.
[01:19:13.857 --> 01:19:18.599]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[01:19:18.619 --> 01:19:20.840]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[01:19:24.699 --> 01:19:29.043]  When the President gives the order, it must be followed.
[01:19:56.465 --> 01:19:57.866]  SAC, this is Crystal Palace.
[01:19:57.986 --> 01:19:58.106]  Inc.
[01:19:58.146 --> 01:19:59.668]  NORAD has declared DEFCON 3.
[01:20:00.128 --> 01:20:01.429]  Scramble all alert aircraft.
[01:20:01.950 --> 01:20:03.811]  I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.
[01:20:05.452 --> 01:20:08.995]  The Epocha spends all its time thinking about World War 3.
[01:20:09.035 --> 01:20:11.377]  Target selection complete.
[01:20:11.437 --> 01:20:13.319]  Time on target sequence complete.
[01:20:13.339 --> 01:20:20.224]  22 Typhoon-class submarines departing Petropavlovsk, turning southbound at North Cap, bearing 095 degrees.
[01:20:20.404 --> 01:20:24.988]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan Air Defense...
[01:20:26.548 --> 01:20:29.651]  From the front lines of the Information War.
[01:20:30.531 --> 01:20:32.873]  Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode.
[01:20:32.953 --> 01:20:34.334]  We are at DEFCON 1.
[01:20:34.574 --> 01:20:39.018]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[01:20:39.038 --> 01:20:39.758]  You bet!
[01:20:40.139 --> 01:20:44.302]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:20:44.462 --> 01:20:47.404]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[01:20:47.424 --> 01:20:48.565]  3... 2... 1... Impact!
[01:20:48.946 --> 01:20:53.229]  Shall we play a game?
[01:20:53.309 --> 01:20:53.849]  How about...
[01:21:00.845 --> 01:21:05.367]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:21:05.707 --> 01:21:07.708]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready.
[01:21:08.008 --> 01:21:08.848]  Awaiting launch codes.
[01:21:09.569 --> 01:21:10.749]  We are in launch mode.
[01:21:11.209 --> 01:21:14.851]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation?
[01:21:15.131 --> 01:21:19.032]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:21:19.513 --> 01:21:19.813]  We're in!
[01:21:20.999 --> 01:21:22.321]  Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[01:21:22.762 --> 01:21:24.765]  We have a Soviet submarine launch detection.
[01:21:25.326 --> 01:21:26.968]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[01:21:27.369 --> 01:21:28.831]  I wish I was like everybody else.
[01:21:29.312 --> 01:21:31.415]  Things began.
[01:21:31.515 --> 01:21:33.719]  The only way is not to die.
[01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:43.281]  When you have U.S.
[01:21:43.321 --> 01:21:52.985]  Senators in both parties saying, we may need to go ahead and nuke Russia first, and the Russians are aware that's almost happened before, what do you think that makes the Russians do?
[01:21:53.265 --> 01:21:54.746]  Well, it makes them go into war mode.
[01:21:57.667 --> 01:21:59.187]  So I don't like them invading Ukraine.
[01:21:59.248 --> 01:22:02.609]  I don't like him putting his nuclear forces on maximum alert.
[01:22:03.009 --> 01:22:07.231]  Only one level above that on their DEFCON, just like our system, and that's fire the weapons.
[01:22:08.227 --> 01:22:14.890]  And so now we have Democrats all over the news saying, let's just use nuclear weapons on Russia.
[01:22:15.310 --> 01:22:16.691]  Think of their ignorance.
[01:22:17.331 --> 01:22:26.595]  Russia has hundreds of submarines off our coast with sea-launched missiles that would vaporize our cities within five minutes on average of being launched.
[01:22:27.136 --> 01:22:30.657]  Sea-launched cruise missiles that fly at Mach 5.
[01:22:31.398 --> 01:22:36.600]  Land-launched systems they can also launch from ships that are at Mach 9 and cannot be shot down.
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:38.941]  And yes, the United States has those too.
[01:22:40.222 --> 01:22:43.383]  That's a Pentagon lie that tries to develop systems that we don't have.
[01:22:43.803 --> 01:22:44.884]  It's on record the U.S.
[01:22:44.944 --> 01:22:45.604]  has those systems.
[01:22:46.164 --> 01:22:51.207]  The point is it's called mutually assured destruction or MAD for a reason.
[01:22:52.047 --> 01:22:55.269]  Because anyone that would violate the MAD doctrine is insane.
[01:22:56.326 --> 01:23:07.298]  And you know, I'm on the side of not having a nuclear war, especially when Russia's not starting a fight with us, and especially after we just heard for years that everything happening in this country is run by Russia, when that was all a giant lie.
[01:23:07.478 --> 01:23:09.160]  The globalists are the outside evil force.
[01:23:22.769 --> 01:23:25.135]  Well, I've known who Kirk Elliott is for a while.
[01:23:25.275 --> 01:23:27.020]  His research is just spot on.
[01:23:27.842 --> 01:23:31.150]  And so, I've invited him to be in studio.
[01:23:32.378 --> 01:23:39.143]  With us, he sent me a giant synopsis and a breakdown of the economy and predictions and what's happening in the world.
[01:23:39.844 --> 01:23:44.988]  We really appreciate him being in studio with us here today.
[01:23:45.808 --> 01:23:50.312]  Dr. Elliott has been safeguarding clients' assets with precious metals for over 21 years.
[01:23:50.772 --> 01:23:59.699]  His firm, Kirk Elliott Precious Metals, serves over 18,000 clients all over the world and in every state and has also reallocated billions of client assets into precious metals.
[01:24:00.399 --> 01:24:01.980]  And boy, was that a good move in the last few years.
[01:24:02.701 --> 01:24:19.672]  He follows the personal and business philosophy of people over profit by focusing 100% liquid on low-cost bullion gold over silver and educating investors as why and how they invest to minimize risk and maximize return safely in a world where our political, economic, and personal religious freedoms are eroded.
[01:24:19.792 --> 01:24:26.857]  Dr. Elliott has earned two PhDs, one in public policy administration focusing on monetary economics and the second PhD in theology.
[01:24:27.277 --> 01:24:29.899]  Dr. Elliott lives in Denver with his wife and children.
[01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:32.161]  KEPM.
[01:24:32.621 --> 01:24:35.804]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:24:36.305 --> 01:24:39.448]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:24:39.548 --> 01:24:40.108]  Or call 720-605-3900.
[01:24:40.148 --> 01:24:47.775]  And, you know, he approached us about six months ago, wanting to be a sponsor.
[01:24:48.436 --> 01:24:54.020]  And I said, wow, I've actually seen his videos before, and I've actually told my crew I wanted to get him on as a guest.
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:25:00.445]  So I said, sure, be a sponsor, but we want to get you on the show as just a guy breaking down what's happening in the world.
[01:25:00.765 --> 01:25:05.048]  I think he's dead on and knows a lot of stuff I don't even know and a lot of things people don't know out there.
[01:25:05.949 --> 01:25:11.293]  So last time he was on for like over an hour and a half, he never even really talked about his company or what he's doing.
[01:25:11.493 --> 01:25:17.358]  But I do want to tell people it is an extremely smart move to get into Precious Metals and
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:22.183]  The thing to do is the bullion, gold and silver.
[01:25:22.624 --> 01:25:26.887]  That is where you are getting a great deal and he is the place to go.
[01:25:26.907 --> 01:25:31.311]  He didn't even want to plug that up front, but I'm doing it because he's a great sponsor.
[01:25:39.437 --> 01:25:40.258]  We're good to go.
[01:25:58.163 --> 01:25:58.963]  We're on the same page.
[01:25:59.023 --> 01:26:00.884]  I just got your list of topics this morning.
[01:26:01.344 --> 01:26:03.585]  I was already planning to talk about the fall of Rome.
[01:26:04.145 --> 01:26:07.006]  We're simpatico, because that's exactly where you wanted to go first.
[01:26:07.026 --> 01:26:09.347]  So, give us a little snapshot of what's coming up in your presentation.
[01:26:10.227 --> 01:26:15.128]  Well, I heard you talking earlier on in the show, kind of how this is the endgame, right?
[01:26:15.348 --> 01:26:16.709]  The things that are happening politically.
[01:26:17.189 --> 01:26:21.370]  Well, economically, politically, socially, spiritually, America's in this downfall.
[01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:26.452]  We have amazingly shocking parallels with the fall of Rome in America today.
[01:26:27.052 --> 01:26:28.653]  We're going to go over the budget.
[01:26:28.713 --> 01:26:29.754]  I want to go over the U.S.
[01:26:29.814 --> 01:26:35.857]  budget that Biden put together and just show you how we're way worse than Rome was.
[01:26:36.317 --> 01:26:37.698]  We've got bank failures.
[01:26:37.838 --> 01:26:40.719]  If you look at the graph of debt since he got in, it's going straight up.
[01:26:41.039 --> 01:26:42.080]  Oh, straight up.
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:42.960]  It's through the roof.
[01:26:44.521 --> 01:26:49.164]  The viewers will be shocked as to how much we've actually accumulated in just this year.
[01:26:49.884 --> 01:26:58.370]  Just in 2023, it was so bad that we did triple the amount of what took 204 years prior to accumulate.
[01:26:58.390 --> 01:26:59.491]  I mean, this is just bad.
[01:27:00.011 --> 01:27:01.853]  So we're going to go over that.
[01:27:01.913 --> 01:27:06.836]  We're going to go over central bank digital currency, which I believe is their endgame.
[01:27:06.856 --> 01:27:17.324]  The timeline, not just what I think, but taking it out of the words for the Bank for International Settlements, the World Economic Forum, like what you were going over, they're meeting right now to
[01:27:18.064 --> 01:27:19.084]  Learn how to destroy us.
[01:27:19.405 --> 01:27:20.505]  Let's be clear.
[01:27:21.285 --> 01:27:29.489]  The Chai Com government, the German government, the Swiss government, University of Texas, they're all very quietly hoarding gold.
[01:27:30.009 --> 01:27:34.131]  Because they know that when we go into this hyperinflation, that's going to be king.
[01:27:35.575 --> 01:27:37.316]  They've already got their plan B established.
[01:27:37.476 --> 01:27:45.219]  It's possibly their plan A. So all the listeners know, and I should have pulled this up, and I know it's in your report here, anybody can type in U.S.
[01:27:45.259 --> 01:27:46.559]  monetization of debt, U.S.
[01:27:46.599 --> 01:27:53.562]  debt, and as he said, Biden gets in, it's more money created than ever existed before in just the last three years.
[01:27:53.862 --> 01:27:55.403]  There's no way to hide that inflation.
[01:27:55.743 --> 01:27:58.964]  So their statement that inflation isn't a problem, we all know that's a lie.
[01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:00.501]  It's a lie.
[01:28:00.961 --> 01:28:02.383]  I don't know how they're going to get out of it.
[01:28:02.844 --> 01:28:12.557]  And even their own cooked numbers, their own cooked inflationary numbers, they said, oh, we can pause interest rates and then we're going to lower them next year because we've won this war against inflation.
[01:28:13.098 --> 01:28:13.859]  No, they haven't.
[01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:14.880]  They haven't.
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:16.382]  Our wallets will tell us that.
[01:28:16.402 --> 01:28:17.343]  And this is their problem.
[01:28:17.864 --> 01:28:19.245]  This is their problem.
[01:28:19.325 --> 01:28:23.708]  There's really no escaping this, and this is why this is an endgame moment.
[01:28:24.209 --> 01:28:29.392]  But, like any endgame moment, the battle is at the city gates right now, right?
[01:28:29.412 --> 01:28:32.395]  Somebody's going to win, somebody's going to lose, and this is why it's so intense.
[01:28:33.635 --> 01:28:34.796]  That's why it's so intense.
[01:28:35.497 --> 01:28:40.300]  As Lennon said, Ibo Gabi was right, there are decades where nothing happens, there are weeks where decades happen.
[01:28:41.121 --> 01:28:42.302]  And we are now in that point.
[01:28:42.322 --> 01:28:45.224]  Alright, you do a great presentation, I'm going to try to shut up.
[01:28:46.064 --> 01:28:48.530]  And just let you roll when we come back.
[01:28:48.731 --> 01:28:50.575]  Everybody, tune in.
[01:28:50.615 --> 01:28:52.099]  Tell your friends and family, tune in now.
[01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:53.923]  This is going to be life-saving information.
[01:28:53.943 --> 01:28:54.324]  Stay with us.
[01:28:58.384 --> 01:29:02.666]  29 years on air, all I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalists.
[01:29:03.366 --> 01:29:08.689]  And I've done the best job I can to tell the truth and be accurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[01:29:09.089 --> 01:29:11.630]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves.
[01:29:12.050 --> 01:29:16.452]  Unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people, we don't do that.
[01:29:16.913 --> 01:29:18.813]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[01:29:19.174 --> 01:29:21.195]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product.
[01:29:21.235 --> 01:29:21.835]  It's so powerful.
[01:29:22.755 --> 01:29:27.740]  This is the breakdown product, after your cells process it, of folic acid.
[01:29:28.321 --> 01:29:32.805]  Methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[01:29:33.266 --> 01:29:34.487]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[01:29:34.527 --> 01:29:35.728]  It's not a stimulant.
[01:29:35.848 --> 01:29:37.450]  It energizes your cells.
[01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:40.512]  And then everything else you take just supercharges it.
[01:29:40.572 --> 01:29:41.393]  It's so insane.
[01:29:41.753 --> 01:29:43.254]  It's foundational energy.
[01:29:43.715 --> 01:29:47.858]  The strongest formula out there at infowarstore.com.
[01:29:48.258 --> 01:29:52.301]  It doesn't just energize this operation against the tyrants, it energizes you.
[01:29:52.582 --> 01:29:53.983]  Get foundational energy now!
[01:29:58.243 --> 01:30:04.145]  We started producing over two years ago with a top independent video game maker, New World or Worse.
[01:30:05.026 --> 01:30:11.248]  And it got behind, we added a lot of stuff to it, we up-edited it, it's already a hit game, people love it, we put it out on AlexJonesGame.com.
[01:30:11.789 --> 01:30:24.694]  Then, Steam waited months, the number one online video game platform, to approve it, and they approved it a week ago, and it went live yesterday, right when the Jeffrey Epstein list broke, and it was the top story in the world.
[01:30:25.234 --> 01:30:27.037]  That is God's hand on this.
[01:30:27.117 --> 01:30:30.701]  So as Garth Brooks says, some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers.
[01:30:31.001 --> 01:30:34.706]  I wanted this out a year ago, but it came out with perfect timing.
[01:30:34.966 --> 01:30:35.947]  It's an incredible game.
[01:30:36.228 --> 01:30:36.848]  People love it.
[01:30:36.909 --> 01:30:38.490]  It's got a voiceover I did for it.
[01:30:38.931 --> 01:30:39.592]  It's amazing.
[01:30:39.652 --> 01:30:41.154]  Get it at alexjonesgame.com.
[01:30:41.434 --> 01:30:44.358]  You play it there on the site, but click on the link to Steam.
[01:30:45.038 --> 01:30:48.841]  So you can go to their site and get it and download it to all your devices.
[01:30:48.921 --> 01:30:51.183]  Get it at Steam right now.
[01:30:51.203 --> 01:30:55.186]  We'll put links on the screen and under it below right here at InfoWars.com.
[01:30:55.446 --> 01:30:56.347]  Get the video game.
[01:30:56.487 --> 01:30:57.067]  Change the world.
[01:30:58.368 --> 01:31:03.833]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[01:31:04.573 --> 01:31:08.857]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[01:31:09.257 --> 01:31:13.640]  We finally have a limited run back in supply at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:31:15.041 --> 01:31:17.804]  So many people have serious issues.
[01:31:18.105 --> 01:31:19.226]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[01:31:19.666 --> 01:31:25.092]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[01:31:25.613 --> 01:31:31.059]  Most other iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements, so you don't download it.
[01:31:31.659 --> 01:31:34.422]  But this is pure atomic certified
[01:31:36.309 --> 01:31:36.629]  I don't.
[01:31:37.249 --> 01:31:40.310]  X2 is now back in stock, discounted.
[01:31:40.650 --> 01:31:42.330]  So I'm giving Thanksgiving right now.
[01:31:42.711 --> 01:31:45.231]  This product being here, it funds the InfoWar.
[01:31:45.271 --> 01:31:49.272]  But I guarantee you, you take this for a few weeks, you will feel the difference.
[01:31:49.432 --> 01:31:50.232]  It is amazing.
[01:31:50.552 --> 01:31:52.193]  It's the Missing Link X2.
[01:31:52.673 --> 01:31:54.613]  Back in stock at the end of 2023 at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:31:54.913 --> 01:31:54.933]  X2.
[01:31:57.978 --> 01:32:01.659]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:07.122]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at mfullmorestore.com.
[01:32:07.622 --> 01:32:19.546]  They are both clones of national best-selling products from a major pharmaceutical slash supplement maker that are listeners and patriots that are allowing us to private label it at a lower price you'll find in stores.
[01:32:19.966 --> 01:32:23.148]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[01:32:24.148 --> 01:32:24.609]  Thanks for watching!
[01:32:43.843 --> 01:32:49.146]  Renew from InfoWarsMD exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[01:32:49.546 --> 01:32:51.087]  Introducing them both, 25% off.
[01:32:51.247 --> 01:32:55.730]  You'll find them exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com and they fund their operation.
[01:33:00.332 --> 01:33:06.236]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:10.541 --> 01:33:14.403]  First came Pac-Man, and Donkey Kong, and Super Mario Brothers.
[01:33:14.964 --> 01:33:18.265]  And now, the ultimate retro nostalgia throwback game.
[01:33:18.866 --> 01:33:23.108]  I present to the world, Alex Jones's New World Order Wars!
[01:33:23.969 --> 01:33:25.730]  They're turning the friggin' frogs gay!
[01:33:26.350 --> 01:33:27.110]  I'll eat your ass!
[01:33:28.351 --> 01:33:29.392]  You Nazi scum!
[01:33:31.153 --> 01:33:33.654]  Let's free the patriots and defeat the globalist techies.
[01:33:35.222 --> 01:33:38.886]  We are going to defeat the globalists very bigly.
[01:33:39.787 --> 01:33:41.549]  This game is mostly peaceful.
[01:33:49.984 --> 01:33:52.805]  I'm going to lower the world's population.
[01:33:53.745 --> 01:33:54.686]  Oh, big deal.
[01:33:54.966 --> 01:33:56.466]  I'm taking you down, rapist.
[01:33:56.746 --> 01:34:00.288]  I did not have sexual relations with that saxophone.
[01:34:00.548 --> 01:34:07.610]  Download it now at alexjonesgame.com, because as we all know, anything badass gets censored!
[01:34:09.891 --> 01:34:21.474]  New Order Wars, now available at Steam, despite the censors.
[01:34:22.035 --> 01:34:27.296]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:34:37.599 --> 01:34:43.081]  All right, the British government, the Swedish government, the German government, all the documents are public, in public statements.
[01:34:43.501 --> 01:34:45.182]  They prepare for war.
[01:34:45.562 --> 01:34:49.344]  That's their plan to get us to accept all of these huge changes.
[01:34:49.364 --> 01:34:55.026]  The end of the old monetary system and the new central bank digital currencies, the market to be system.
[01:34:55.686 --> 01:34:56.928]  That's the only way to describe it.
[01:34:56.968 --> 01:34:58.349]  It's the only thing you can call it.
[01:34:58.810 --> 01:35:00.211]  That's what it is.
[01:35:00.231 --> 01:35:04.036]  All right, Kirk Elliott, multiple PhD expert on what's happening.
[01:35:04.096 --> 01:35:08.321]  I totally think your analysis is dead on, but you brought the receipts.
[01:35:08.361 --> 01:35:09.603]  You've got the numbers here.
[01:35:10.363 --> 01:35:12.126]  Let's start with your presentation now.
[01:35:16.132 --> 01:35:18.553]  What's happening to America has been seen before in history.
[01:35:18.613 --> 01:35:19.293]  It's the fall of Rome.
[01:35:19.313 --> 01:35:21.254]  I mean, truly, it has.
[01:35:21.334 --> 01:35:28.137]  And so, as I was doing some research on this, it's like, what are some of the factors that caused Rome to fall?
[01:35:28.877 --> 01:35:30.478]  Number one, they had civil wars, right?
[01:35:30.518 --> 01:35:37.561]  They had faction fought against faction to get control of the huge, basically, state apparatus and all of its public loot.
[01:35:38.001 --> 01:35:39.281]  Well, we're seeing that in America.
[01:35:39.502 --> 01:35:42.363]  The internal fights is what weakened it, just like we see now.
[01:35:42.623 --> 01:35:42.743]  Yeah.
[01:35:43.362 --> 01:35:44.103]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:35:44.143 --> 01:35:45.785]  Number two, there was mass corruption.
[01:35:48.027 --> 01:35:49.909]  No further explanation needed.
[01:35:49.949 --> 01:35:50.870]  We have that everywhere.
[01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:54.814]  Huge bureaucracy, high taxes, burdensome regulations.
[01:35:55.535 --> 01:36:00.039]  Businesses were called upon to support the growing body of public parasites, right?
[01:36:00.119 --> 01:36:01.141]  But here's the big thing.
[01:36:01.901 --> 01:36:10.949]  One-third of the citizens of Rome were getting government payments, and basically Rome crumbled under the weight of those entitlements.
[01:36:11.469 --> 01:36:12.030]  One-third!
[01:36:12.510 --> 01:36:15.853]  So, as I was looking through... Rome invented welfare!
[01:36:16.614 --> 01:36:17.815]  Yeah, they invented welfare.
[01:36:18.195 --> 01:36:19.516]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:36:19.556 --> 01:36:22.519]  So, I was looking at Biden's budget.
[01:36:22.799 --> 01:36:26.762]  You go to whitehouse.gov, you can look at the budget, go to table S.
[01:36:43.271 --> 01:36:50.361]  Other mandatory programs like food stamps, women, infant, children programs, you know, just basically the handouts and the entitlements.
[01:36:50.401 --> 01:36:52.985]  Now, Social Security is not an entitlement.
[01:36:53.085 --> 01:36:54.286]  It's a mandatory payment, right?
[01:36:54.327 --> 01:36:55.628]  You pay into something your whole life.
[01:36:55.668 --> 01:36:56.590]  You better get it.
[01:36:57.090 --> 01:36:57.831]  The benefit, right?
[01:36:57.871 --> 01:36:59.874]  But you try to take that away.
[01:37:00.555 --> 01:37:01.936]  And you've got a mutiny on your hands.
[01:37:01.956 --> 01:37:02.937]  So you can't take it away.
[01:37:02.977 --> 01:37:06.459]  So it's really easy to give, it's really hard to take away.
[01:37:06.499 --> 01:37:07.580]  So that's not going away.
[01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:18.888]  But you add those up on this summary table, $3.916 trillion in just mandatory payments.
[01:37:19.428 --> 01:37:21.630]  How much do we bring in as a country?
[01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:28.274]  Well, our total receipts, our federal tax revenues, are $4.72 trillion.
[01:37:28.314 --> 01:37:29.655]  So that comes to 83%.
[01:37:32.618 --> 01:37:35.119]  Not one-third, like when Rome fell.
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:39.843]  83% is Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, women and children programs, food stamps.
[01:37:40.664 --> 01:37:41.825]  83% of everything we bring in.
[01:37:41.885 --> 01:37:45.948]  Now, you add to that the interest on our federal debt.
[01:37:46.288 --> 01:37:48.210]  Well, it's like 47% of service now, right?
[01:37:48.590 --> 01:37:54.015]  Yeah, it's bonkers because we have $34 trillion worth of federal debt.
[01:37:54.455 --> 01:38:00.200]  The interest payments estimated on the budget are $796 billion.
[01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:02.402]  However, the real numbers just came out.
[01:38:02.422 --> 01:38:03.303]  We're pushing a trillion.
[01:38:04.375 --> 01:38:13.342]  So, when we bring in 4.7, right, and we're spending a trillion dollars a year in just interest-only payments, that's just complete waste?
[01:38:13.923 --> 01:38:14.403]  Well, that's over 20%.
[01:38:15.044 --> 01:38:25.472]  So, you add up mandatory payments, welfare and entitlements, plus the interest payments, it's 99.8% of everything we bring in as a nation.
[01:38:25.492 --> 01:38:26.093]  It's basically 100%.
[01:38:27.314 --> 01:38:31.777]  So, how then do we fund our defense budget?
[01:38:32.057 --> 01:38:32.458]  How about
[01:38:33.479 --> 01:38:35.400]  And how about infrastructure?
[01:38:35.661 --> 01:38:36.842]  How about running the country?
[01:38:37.082 --> 01:38:40.004]  And by the way, the IMF and World Bank have done this to a bunch of third world countries.
[01:38:40.424 --> 01:38:43.226]  They even admit this is a known plan to capture a country.
[01:38:43.627 --> 01:38:46.189]  So they've now maneuvered us to the point of total insolvency.
[01:38:46.429 --> 01:38:47.850]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:38:47.970 --> 01:38:51.392]  And really, as I look throughout history,
[01:38:52.213 --> 01:39:02.700]  Whenever a country's debt is basically equal to their gross domestic product, that country ceases to exist in its existing form.
[01:39:02.860 --> 01:39:04.100]  Weimar Republic, Germany.
[01:39:04.201 --> 01:39:05.601]  Zimbabwe, Africa.
[01:39:05.862 --> 01:39:06.702]  Yeah.
[01:39:06.982 --> 01:39:07.523]  Argentina.
[01:39:07.703 --> 01:39:08.343]  Venezuela, right?
[01:39:08.383 --> 01:39:12.486]  There's either a change in political structure, meaning they go from a
[01:39:13.226 --> 01:39:19.369]  A republic or a democracy to a dictatorship, a dictatorship the other way, or you have a complete change in currency.
[01:39:19.610 --> 01:39:20.630]  And that's what Schwab says.
[01:39:21.070 --> 01:39:24.432]  We are creating a crisis, the angrier world, to bring in our new system.
[01:39:25.273 --> 01:39:31.116]  This is on purpose, they admit it is, and now they're upset because we're pointing it out to people and trying to flip it the other way.
[01:39:31.676 --> 01:39:31.876]  Yeah.
[01:39:31.896 --> 01:39:32.836]  Trump's trying to flip it the other way.
[01:39:33.097 --> 01:39:34.377]  Trump's trying to flip it the other way.
[01:39:34.437 --> 01:39:36.178]  See, Trump's telling the truth on this issue.
[01:39:36.738 --> 01:39:47.842]  But when you look at where we are, I remember, Alex, back in about 2007, 2008, I was looking at our debt compared to the gross domestic product, and we were at about 80%.
[01:39:47.982 --> 01:39:49.503]  And I'm thinking, oh my word.
[01:39:50.743 --> 01:39:58.165]  I'm getting scared for America because we're approaching that D-Day of 100% where a country doesn't escape from that.
[01:39:58.585 --> 01:40:07.428]  Because if you apply this to a family, let's say a family, you and your spouse, your debt is greater than your income.
[01:40:07.548 --> 01:40:09.709]  It's going to be mathematically impossible to pay that back.
[01:40:10.029 --> 01:40:12.109]  What's true for an individual is true for a country.
[01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:16.010]  So everything that Ross Perot warned about 35, 40 years, it all came true?
[01:40:16.410 --> 01:40:17.651]  Yeah, it all came true.
[01:40:18.351 --> 01:40:21.352]  Yeah, and what's true for a country is true for the world.
[01:40:21.812 --> 01:40:36.857]  So the Bank for International Settlements just came out last week with their projections that by the year 2028, four years from now, 100% of the world, every country in the world, is going to have debt that's equal to their gross domestic product.
[01:40:37.097 --> 01:40:43.440]  That means the world has to go bankrupt because what's true for an individual is true for a nation, what's true for a nation is true for the world.
[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:45.280]  But don't worry, they've got a solution.
[01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:47.001]  Oh, they always have a solution.
[01:40:47.421 --> 01:40:50.683]  A total cashless society controlling every facet of our lives.
[01:40:50.923 --> 01:40:52.484]  Yeah.
[01:40:52.925 --> 01:40:56.627]  And here's where it gets worse, because where are we, debt to GDP?
[01:40:57.267 --> 01:40:57.687]  We're now at 123%.
[01:40:58.288 --> 01:41:02.310]  We blew past the 100% in America.
[01:41:02.631 --> 01:41:03.011]  We're now at 123%.
[01:41:04.392 --> 01:41:08.994]  So the Bank for International Settlements came out with their numbers also last week.
[01:41:09.034 --> 01:41:11.176]  And that's why they're lowering the US government's credit rating.
[01:41:11.576 --> 01:41:15.357]  Yeah, because there is no other outcome other than lowering it.
[01:41:15.798 --> 01:41:18.979]  Total global government debt is $97.1 trillion.
[01:41:19.099 --> 01:41:22.380]  Ours in America is $34 trillion.
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:23.520]  Good grief!
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:27.162]  We're 35% of all global debt just in America.
[01:41:27.182 --> 01:41:30.823]  It's like, do we think that we can bypass math?
[01:41:31.283 --> 01:41:33.404]  And bypass reality just because we're American?
[01:41:33.464 --> 01:41:33.605]  No!
[01:41:33.985 --> 01:41:42.790]  We've violated fundamental rules of success, biblical models of living, where it says, you know, Proverbs tells us a borrower is a slave to the lender.
[01:41:42.810 --> 01:41:46.853]  Well, yeah, we are now the slave to the rest of the world because of our debt and we can't pay it back.
[01:41:46.873 --> 01:41:49.154]  So everything Ron Paul and all of them warned us, we're here.
[01:41:49.214 --> 01:41:51.816]  There's no more, oh, our children will be enslaved.
[01:41:51.876 --> 01:41:52.817]  Well, yeah, we got old.
[01:41:52.897 --> 01:41:54.057]  Now our kids are being enslaved.
[01:41:54.238 --> 01:41:54.538]  We're here.
[01:41:54.818 --> 01:41:55.118]  We're here.
[01:41:55.138 --> 01:41:57.320]  It's not, oh, we don't have to wait anymore and warn people.
[01:41:58.453 --> 01:41:59.475]  They're going to see it now.
[01:41:59.836 --> 01:41:59.976]  Yeah.
[01:42:00.197 --> 01:42:01.619]  Which is a weak point for the globalists.
[01:42:01.639 --> 01:42:07.491]  See, we have to take every bad thing as an opportunity, and that's how I see it, because now people are going to finally meet reality.
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:26.674]  They're going to, and so where Rome fell, right, when one third of the population of Rome was getting entitlements handouts of some form, there are well over 27 states, Alex, where welfare payments are greater than having a minimum wage job.
[01:42:27.054 --> 01:42:31.837]  For example, in Hawaii, $60,590 a year is what you would make on welfare.
[01:42:31.878 --> 01:42:33.299]  That's greater than a minimum wage job.
[01:42:34.499 --> 01:42:36.201]  Debt DC, $50,820.
[01:42:36.561 --> 01:42:37.301]  Massachusetts, $50,540.
[01:42:37.361 --> 01:42:40.264]  The list goes on and on and on.
[01:42:40.644 --> 01:42:46.408]  Well, to receive government payments, you can't have another job or else they cease.
[01:42:46.488 --> 01:42:50.691]  So, you could sit on a beach in Hawaii just drinking a Mai Tai, making $60,590 a year.
[01:42:53.493 --> 01:42:54.934]  Where is the incentive to work?
[01:42:54.974 --> 01:42:58.657]  Now, for you, me, for most of your viewers, it's like, we have to work.
[01:42:58.697 --> 01:42:59.818]  We're created to work.
[01:42:59.858 --> 01:43:07.744]  We're created to do something good, to use the gifts God has given us, to change society, to make an impact and have an eternal impact in people's lives.
[01:43:09.185 --> 01:43:13.588]  Most of the world would say, why should I work if I don't have to?
[01:43:13.708 --> 01:43:15.749]  And that's what Gen Z and Millennials are saying.
[01:43:15.769 --> 01:43:20.612]  And guys, I sent you a clip, the latest in Philadelphia, of the people on fentanyl.
[01:43:20.672 --> 01:43:23.054]  Show that clip, because you think that's just isolated.
[01:43:23.074 --> 01:43:24.735]  That's all around the place in Austin.
[01:43:25.395 --> 01:43:28.758]  There are a lot of people that don't even know how to work, who are like zombies.
[01:43:28.858 --> 01:43:30.679]  What are they going to do when this all collapses?
[01:43:31.359 --> 01:43:32.320]  Where are they going to be put?
[01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:33.260]  I mean, look at this.
[01:43:33.841 --> 01:43:34.001]  Wow.
[01:43:36.670 --> 01:43:41.014]  Yeah, I mean, sadly, that looks like downtown Denver.
[01:43:41.234 --> 01:43:43.796]  It looks like downtown any big city in America.
[01:43:44.396 --> 01:43:55.145]  As I walk to the office, I mean, earlier last week I was walking to the office and some guy tried to get my backpack, punched me in the head, and now my eye is like all, you know, swollen.
[01:43:55.185 --> 01:43:56.967]  But, you know, but I won.
[01:43:57.487 --> 01:43:58.428]  I just punched him back.
[01:43:58.728 --> 01:44:01.451]  But this is the world that we're living in right now where
[01:44:02.131 --> 01:44:04.432]  It's economic fallout.
[01:44:04.552 --> 01:44:07.533]  Economic mayhem always brings social disruption.
[01:44:08.133 --> 01:44:10.634]  And that's where we're headed in this country.
[01:44:10.694 --> 01:44:12.794]  Because, now how do you get out of that?
[01:44:12.874 --> 01:44:14.555]  How do the governments try to get out of this?
[01:44:14.595 --> 01:44:16.355]  Well, you debase the currency.
[01:44:16.395 --> 01:44:18.056]  So go back to Rome, right?
[01:44:18.356 --> 01:44:20.116]  Look at this picture on the screen.
[01:44:20.537 --> 01:44:21.137]  Rome is burning.
[01:44:22.077 --> 01:44:22.838]  That's right.
[01:44:52.657 --> 01:44:59.980]  Well, after that, you had the cartel-owning bankers of the Federal Reserve, where they actually charged the U.S.
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:02.480]  Treasury for printing money out of thin air, right?
[01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:03.961]  This is a disaster!
[01:45:04.361 --> 01:45:07.242]  But since 1913, the U.S.
[01:45:07.322 --> 01:45:08.102]  dollar has lost 98%!
[01:45:11.064 --> 01:45:13.487]  98% of its purchasing power.
[01:45:13.747 --> 01:45:16.911]  We're no different than the denarius, which was about 99.97%.
[01:45:18.153 --> 01:45:24.101]  So here's where we're going down the same fateful path, right?
[01:45:24.141 --> 01:45:25.963]  So the writing is on the wall.
[01:45:26.664 --> 01:45:27.745]  So, in America.
[01:45:27.785 --> 01:45:30.107]  So, why is it riding on?
[01:45:30.287 --> 01:45:31.828]  Well, we're following that same path.
[01:45:32.229 --> 01:45:34.570]  America debases its currency just like Rome did.
[01:45:34.631 --> 01:45:35.611]  People now want out.
[01:45:35.972 --> 01:45:38.574]  But it's becoming increasingly difficult to get out.
[01:45:39.575 --> 01:45:40.755]  What do I mean by get out?
[01:45:41.116 --> 01:45:42.797]  People want to take their money out of the bank.
[01:45:42.837 --> 01:45:44.939]  They want to pull it out because they're afraid of bank failures.
[01:45:44.959 --> 01:45:48.041]  They're afraid of their social security going away.
[01:45:48.061 --> 01:45:49.022]  They're afraid of their
[01:45:50.703 --> 01:45:52.343]  401Ks, their IRAs going out.
[01:45:52.423 --> 01:45:53.364]  So what happens?
[01:45:53.544 --> 01:45:54.404]  What do banks do?
[01:45:54.904 --> 01:45:58.525]  I was looking at something that I wrote in 2017.
[01:45:59.185 --> 01:46:07.186]  This was before any of the crisis started happening and I was warning people that banks were going to start restricting withdrawals, they're going to start freezing accounts, they're going to have capital controls.
[01:46:07.626 --> 01:46:11.907]  Banks need to keep their money on hand because they're running out.
[01:46:12.227 --> 01:46:15.208]  They don't want people to take it out, but people need to take it out to live.
[01:46:15.788 --> 01:46:25.161]  This is what happens, and this is why the banking system right now is becoming increasingly unsafe and a dangerous place to hold your money.
[01:46:25.181 --> 01:46:26.703]  And I want you to go there, but let me just add something here.
[01:46:27.664 --> 01:46:32.331]  When I was having Ron Paul on 20 years ago, or 10 years ago, or 5 years ago, when I was having other economists on...
[01:46:33.490 --> 01:46:35.552]  Obviously, it was already way too much debt.
[01:46:35.572 --> 01:46:38.575]  We were way worse than Rome then, but not three times worse than Rome.
[01:46:38.955 --> 01:46:40.576]  It wasn't 120-something percent.
[01:46:41.177 --> 01:46:43.319]  It was 30 to 40 percent.
[01:46:43.479 --> 01:46:44.580]  We were already at Rome levels.
[01:46:45.401 --> 01:46:56.511]  And the globalists didn't have their cashless society, their social credit scores ready, their carbon taxes, their UN treaties to take control of our lives.
[01:46:57.737 --> 01:46:57.797]  I'm
[01:47:14.649 --> 01:47:20.193]  All these groups, including the EU and the UN, they admit the old system's coming down.
[01:47:20.233 --> 01:47:23.916]  I played the clubs here, and they've admitted we've got to get the new thing ready.
[01:47:23.956 --> 01:47:24.737]  It's all going down.
[01:47:25.077 --> 01:47:27.419]  So they're not even denying this policy level.
[01:47:27.739 --> 01:47:29.761]  They know the public's like children on average.
[01:47:29.781 --> 01:47:31.081]  It doesn't read this.
[01:47:31.542 --> 01:47:35.164]  So, yes, things could have gone belly up if they wanted to pull the rug out.
[01:47:36.235 --> 01:47:38.436]  10 years ago, 20 years ago, they already had us.
[01:47:38.996 --> 01:47:44.418]  But they didn't have the control grid in place for them to be the saviors and get more power.
[01:47:44.819 --> 01:47:46.319]  Now it's almost in place.
[01:47:46.359 --> 01:47:47.440]  It's like the planets aligning.
[01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:48.480]  They're making their move.
[01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:50.601]  There's no longer, this is not a prediction.
[01:47:51.462 --> 01:47:58.806]  This is a guarantee, folks, that if you take a .357 Magnum and put it to your head and pull the trigger, you're at least going to be brain damaged, probably dead.
[01:47:59.286 --> 01:48:04.169]  The bullet's already fired, it already went through, there's no doubt this is going down, okay?
[01:48:04.209 --> 01:48:14.435]  So, they can't prop it up anymore, they did it, the new system's here, it's going to be hell, but at least we know what's going on and can get prepared ahead of time.
[01:48:15.848 --> 01:48:19.231]  Yeah, and so, how are people trying to prepare?
[01:48:19.571 --> 01:48:21.112]  They're trying to pull their money out of the banks.
[01:48:21.453 --> 01:48:24.015]  Really, that's only a part of the equation.
[01:48:24.335 --> 01:48:25.156]  That just accelerates it.
[01:48:25.736 --> 01:48:33.763]  Oh yeah, that accelerates it, because during COVID, in March of 2020, the Federal Reserve, through Regulation D, what did they do?
[01:48:33.863 --> 01:48:38.186]  They basically said, hey, the reserve requirement at banks can go down to zero.
[01:48:38.687 --> 01:48:42.250]  Meaning, if you put $100 into your checking account, Alex,
[01:48:43.210 --> 01:48:45.751]  Or anybody watching, the banks could lend out $100.
[01:48:46.611 --> 01:48:48.191]  They didn't have to keep anything on hand.
[01:48:48.271 --> 01:48:49.091]  Why did they do that?
[01:48:49.151 --> 01:49:01.174]  To stimulate the stinky economy during COVID, when nobody was spending money, nobody was earning money, there were shelter-in-place laws, companies were closing down because nobody could go out, they couldn't go out to eat, they couldn't do anything.
[01:49:01.594 --> 01:49:05.235]  So to try to stimulate the economy, they said, okay, lend out everything, 100%.
[01:49:05.955 --> 01:49:09.336]  Well, that caused a cyclical structural problem.
[01:49:09.356 --> 01:49:10.856]  Which was the plan, that's why they did the lockdown.
[01:49:11.276 --> 01:49:13.037]  Which was hugely the plan.
[01:49:13.097 --> 01:49:14.398]  So, what's the problem?
[01:49:14.998 --> 01:49:19.980]  In times of crisis, when people aren't working, there's more withdrawals coming out of the banks than there are deposits.
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:21.601]  And they had zero capital.
[01:49:21.661 --> 01:49:25.122]  And now people have maxed out their credit cards, that's admitted, like 70% of people.
[01:49:25.622 --> 01:49:26.803]  People are living hand-to-mouth.
[01:49:27.363 --> 01:49:28.824]  People can't even afford gas anymore.
[01:49:29.284 --> 01:49:30.885]  Meanwhile, Biden tells us the economy's great.
[01:49:30.965 --> 01:49:32.225]  What are they positioning us for?
[01:49:32.686 --> 01:49:37.868]  And how do you guess, because you've guessed a lot of stuff that's kind of accurate, dead wreck and how this is going to unfold?
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:41.540]  Well, I think we saw Bank Failure 1.0.
[01:49:42.001 --> 01:49:48.262]  It was Silicon Valley, Credit Suisse, First Republic, Silvergate Bank.
[01:49:48.462 --> 01:49:49.282]  I mean, all of those.
[01:49:49.522 --> 01:49:51.222]  That was just a tremor before the Bank Failure.
[01:49:51.262 --> 01:49:54.203]  Yes, I think Bank Failure 2.0 is coming.
[01:49:54.263 --> 01:50:03.645]  I mean, just last week, the CEO of Citigroup, you know, the second, third largest bank in North America, said, we're laying off 10% of our workforce.
[01:50:04.145 --> 01:50:05.305]  By the way, you see me pointing?
[01:50:05.906 --> 01:50:07.646]  Those are clips we're going to take out and put on info.
[01:50:09.695 --> 01:50:14.002]  But this whole start over on bank failure and what it means and how we're going to put this clip out.
[01:50:14.022 --> 01:50:15.164]  Go ahead.
[01:50:15.364 --> 01:50:21.934]  So the CEO of Citigroup last week basically said we're laying off 20 or 10 percent of our workforce.
[01:50:21.954 --> 01:50:22.575]  That's over 20,000 people.
[01:50:24.358 --> 01:50:31.344]  Well, why would a bank, in a high interest rate environment, you think, oh, they're more profitable, they're making so much money.
[01:50:31.424 --> 01:50:32.405]  No, they are not.
[01:50:32.806 --> 01:50:46.338]  Because when most of America is living hand-to-mouth, month-to-month, paycheck-to-paycheck, and interest rates keep going up, and inflation keeps going up, they can't live, so they're taking more money out of the bank than they're putting in, and there's delinquencies.
[01:50:46.678 --> 01:50:48.960]  A series of delinquencies leads to default.
[01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:50.542]  So it's a bank run in slow motion?
[01:50:50.962 --> 01:50:53.626]  Yeah, and I think the bigger bank run is still coming.
[01:50:53.886 --> 01:50:56.370]  The one that we saw in March of last year was Silicon Valley Bank.
[01:50:56.590 --> 01:50:57.392]  So that's my question.
[01:50:57.432 --> 01:50:59.334]  What are the different ways this can unravel?
[01:51:00.359 --> 01:51:23.756]  So I think first there's a bank run people start to pull their money out then then that creates crisis now they think oh if my bank isn't safe which is should safest money that we have it's a bank for crying out loud you have this this view of your assets in a bank vault you know full of like hundreds just sitting in this vault that's not the reality when you deposit money into a bank
[01:51:24.156 --> 01:51:26.137]  It's basically a security instrument.
[01:51:26.478 --> 01:51:30.860]  The bank then goes and invests that in companies and stocks and bonds and mutual funds and everything else.
[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:32.861]  Same thing you would, except on a larger scale.
[01:51:33.382 --> 01:51:41.747]  But after the crisis of 2007 to 2009, they changed the way that banks deal with money.
[01:51:42.167 --> 01:51:46.990]  So most people don't realize this, but you don't own the money that you have in the bank.
[01:51:47.190 --> 01:51:47.651]  They do.
[01:51:48.251 --> 01:51:57.414]  So in 2009, they came up with a concept called beneficial ownership, meaning you gave up your ownership of your deposits to the bank.
[01:51:57.834 --> 01:52:00.255]  So we hear the term bail-in, right?
[01:52:00.355 --> 01:52:01.256]  Or bail-outs, right?
[01:52:01.636 --> 01:52:05.437]  Bail-in is when you would... And the last time that was done was like 15, 16 years ago.
[01:52:05.917 --> 01:52:08.998]  In some areas of Europe, they would just grab money out of your bank account.
[01:52:09.119 --> 01:52:09.439]  Correct.
[01:52:09.999 --> 01:52:11.219]  But they can do that legally.
[01:52:11.279 --> 01:52:13.660]  This isn't something that's brand new.
[01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:15.901]  Now that's in the FDIC regulations, right?
[01:52:16.181 --> 01:52:26.006]  Yeah, so yes, it's under the Universal Commercial Code, I think it's 133-1 or something like that, where they changed ownership of your assets to them.
[01:52:26.326 --> 01:52:30.468]  It's now collateral, so they can use your assets that you think are yours.
[01:52:30.628 --> 01:52:31.589]  It's all debt instruments.
[01:52:31.809 --> 01:52:32.909]  It's all debt instruments.
[01:52:33.009 --> 01:52:43.875]  You gave it to them, so if they need the money to pay off a debt, the derivatives debt, like after 2009, they can, and they don't have to ask you, so your money is no longer yours in the bank.
[01:52:45.455 --> 01:52:46.575]  That's devastating.
[01:52:46.936 --> 01:52:54.058]  When people would realize that, it's going to cause a run, because the banks should be the safest asset that people have.
[01:52:54.678 --> 01:52:59.880]  So if that's not safe, well I foresee the next step is a run on the stock market.
[01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:04.682]  A run on all their other investments, because it's like, we don't trust anything anymore.
[01:53:04.942 --> 01:53:07.083]  And why are they then positioning themselves for that?
[01:53:07.563 --> 01:53:08.804]  To make us bring in the new system.
[01:53:09.044 --> 01:53:11.866]  When, oh my God, the stock market went down by half, the banks are run.
[01:53:11.906 --> 01:53:14.628]  Don't worry, we have a new digital currency, as the EU says.
[01:53:15.008 --> 01:53:16.790]  It's ready, just download this, it's all fixed.
[01:53:17.622 --> 01:53:21.343]  Well, okay, so to answer that, I could ask you a question.
[01:53:21.383 --> 01:53:23.663]  Let's say we know what they're saying.
[01:53:23.844 --> 01:53:33.946]  I have a timeline that we're going to go over on Central Bank Digital Currency and how it's been implemented and how it's come in, not even sneakily, they don't hide in the shadows anymore.
[01:53:33.986 --> 01:53:36.287]  They tell us exactly what they're going to do.
[01:53:36.787 --> 01:53:37.507]  Exactly.
[01:53:39.088 --> 01:53:45.473]  By the way, I want that up front in the whole interview, because we're live right now, but the posted one will get even more views.
[01:53:45.994 --> 01:53:47.235]  Exactly, that's what's so frustrating.
[01:53:47.495 --> 01:53:55.282]  If you study it, you know the battle plan, but they know the public doesn't check that out, but we're able to give it to the public, that could really mess up their operation.
[01:53:55.882 --> 01:53:59.825]  Oh, it could, because if I were to say, hey Alex,
[01:54:00.766 --> 01:54:05.754]  I'm with the Bank for International Settlements, I'm with the IMF, and we have this plan.
[01:54:06.135 --> 01:54:11.364]  We have this plan where we're going to disallow you from buying or selling if we don't like your ideology.
[01:54:12.430 --> 01:54:28.682]  Most of these globalists don't like your ideology, they don't like mine, they don't... I've already debanked me, they've already... But if they were to say, hey, we're not going to let you take money out of the bank, buy or sell with whom you want, what you want, when you want, you would say, no, we're not in for this, right?
[01:54:29.282 --> 01:54:31.704]  They know most of the world would say that.
[01:54:31.764 --> 01:54:35.567]  Nobody wants that kind of big brother spyware on your bank account.
[01:54:36.227 --> 01:54:42.869]  Um, the ability to cut you off from buying or selling because every evangelical Catholic that I know says, Kirk, this is Revelation 13.
[01:54:42.909 --> 01:54:44.949]  They've got to get you to opt into it during a crisis.
[01:54:45.049 --> 01:54:45.249]  Yes.
[01:54:45.549 --> 01:54:54.812]  So how would you give that up, your ability to buy or sell, if a crisis is so bad that you can't pay your rent, you can't pay your mortgage, you can't feed your kids, you can't live.
[01:54:55.192 --> 01:54:59.213]  So at times of crisis, which happens to be happening during an election year,
[01:55:00.433 --> 01:55:03.115]  People will say, okay, this is so bad.
[01:55:03.175 --> 01:55:04.036]  Banks are shutting down.
[01:55:04.096 --> 01:55:05.677]  All this economic failure.
[01:55:05.957 --> 01:55:06.998]  We'll give you what you want.
[01:55:07.038 --> 01:55:08.940]  Government just will give you away our freedoms.
[01:55:09.260 --> 01:55:10.301]  Just take care of us.
[01:55:10.401 --> 01:55:11.982]  Make sure that we can still feed our family.
[01:55:12.462 --> 01:55:15.665]  This is what's happening right now, right in front of us.
[01:55:16.045 --> 01:55:17.206]  And people don't understand.
[01:55:17.586 --> 01:55:20.348]  Central bank digital currency is not the savior of the world.
[01:55:20.468 --> 01:55:20.929]  It's awful.
[01:55:20.949 --> 01:55:24.832]  See, they're marketing it as, hey, we can stop drug trafficking.
[01:55:24.872 --> 01:55:26.092]  We can stop human trafficking.
[01:55:26.153 --> 01:55:26.913]  We can stop money.
[01:55:26.933 --> 01:55:27.754]  Meanwhile, I wrote all that.
[01:55:28.174 --> 01:55:33.978]  Yeah, and it's like, I don't want that garbage around either, but the flip side of it is... Oh, it's total crap.
[01:55:34.018 --> 01:55:38.080]  Make all your houses glass, in case you might do something wrong, but their houses aren't glass.
[01:55:39.001 --> 01:55:39.721]  It's to control us.
[01:55:40.141 --> 01:55:43.643]  It's absolutely, this is not meant to fix a system.
[01:55:44.104 --> 01:55:47.706]  This is meant to have complete people control over all of us.
[01:55:48.026 --> 01:55:48.766]  Build back better.
[01:55:49.867 --> 01:55:50.888]  Get rid of the old system.
[01:55:52.034 --> 01:55:53.375]  Factory set, bring in the new.
[01:56:12.205 --> 01:56:13.746]  Like, let's say you're walking down the street to go for coffee.
[01:56:13.786 --> 01:56:17.389]  And they're closing, they're quietly, the bench are quietly closing in slow motion.
[01:56:17.590 --> 01:56:22.594]  Yeah, well in fast motion, but nobody cares because if you're walking down the street to go get coffee.
[01:56:22.614 --> 01:56:23.675]  I mean, I agree, but not in one day.
[01:56:23.895 --> 01:56:26.537]  So it's like a million miles an hour, not a trillion miles an hour.
[01:56:26.677 --> 01:56:27.198]  Correct.
[01:56:27.558 --> 01:56:34.324]  Yeah, so if you go down, let's say you banked at PNC Bank and you're walking down the street to the coffee shop and it's like, oh man.
[01:56:35.104 --> 01:56:37.706]  My PNC Bank has plywood on the windows.
[01:56:37.786 --> 01:56:38.347]  It's closed.
[01:56:38.807 --> 01:56:40.008]  You think, all right, well that's sad.
[01:56:40.048 --> 01:56:42.229]  Now I have to go three miles down the street to the next branch.
[01:56:42.349 --> 01:56:44.451]  Nobody cares about a branch closing.
[01:56:44.951 --> 01:56:47.553]  But what if in 2023, over 2,000 branches closed?
[01:56:47.573 --> 01:56:48.534]  2022, over 2,000 branches closed?
[01:56:48.554 --> 01:56:49.555]  2021, over 2,000 branches closed?
[01:56:49.575 --> 01:56:51.496]  That's 6,000 bank branches that have closed over the last
[01:56:59.742 --> 01:57:01.623]  Because they don't need worms on the line.
[01:57:01.663 --> 01:57:02.784]  They've got us all in debt.
[01:57:03.204 --> 01:57:06.426]  Now they're getting rid of the cheese on the mousetrap because we're already in the mousetrap.
[01:57:06.707 --> 01:57:07.327]  Correct.
[01:57:07.647 --> 01:57:10.129]  So that doesn't make a story, but it should.
[01:57:10.149 --> 01:57:10.969]  You're right.
[01:57:11.009 --> 01:57:14.992]  There are bank closings and bank closing branches everywhere.
[01:57:15.312 --> 01:57:18.554]  In fact, I've had that experience trying to go to the bank and they closed them.
[01:57:19.355 --> 01:57:20.956]  So what is that the equivalent of?
[01:57:21.276 --> 01:57:23.538]  When a company starts to run out of money,
[01:57:24.218 --> 01:57:24.738]  What do they do?
[01:57:24.838 --> 01:57:26.219]  They start to lay people off.
[01:57:26.259 --> 01:57:29.760]  They start to cut their expenses because they want to survive.
[01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:34.261]  A branch closing is the equivalent of banks trying to save on their pensions.
[01:57:34.281 --> 01:57:35.282]  All right, Kirk Elliott, stay there.
[01:57:35.302 --> 01:57:36.622]  Hour number three straight ahead.
[01:57:36.662 --> 01:57:38.123]  We'll get into the CBDCs.
[01:57:38.563 --> 01:57:40.043]  We'll get into the Cashless Society.
[01:57:40.063 --> 01:57:41.324]  What's going to unfold next?
[01:57:41.764 --> 01:57:42.364]  Stay with us.
[01:57:43.144 --> 01:57:44.825]  KEPM.com.
[01:57:48.854 --> 01:57:53.098]  The Second American Revolution is happening now right in front of you.
[01:57:53.398 --> 01:57:57.762]  And you're tuned in to InfoWars because you're either looking for the truth or you're already a patriot.
[01:57:58.222 --> 01:58:06.090]  I'm asking you now to realize we are at the fulcrum, the crossroads, in the fight for human destiny and human future.
[01:58:06.730 --> 01:58:08.471]  Please spread the word about the broadcast.
[01:58:08.931 --> 01:58:14.173]  Please buy great products at FootwearStore.com and please pray for the transmission.
[01:58:14.453 --> 01:58:15.634]  Without you, we're going to fail.
[01:58:16.074 --> 01:58:25.138]  But if you simply take action and spread the word and pray for the broadcast and buy the products, you will continue to aid us together.
[01:58:25.518 --> 01:58:26.739]  In our victory against these tyrants.
[01:58:27.020 --> 01:58:28.601]  But now is the time to make the decision.
[01:58:29.162 --> 01:58:31.945]  I know there's millions of forms of media out there and all this BS.
[01:58:32.165 --> 01:58:33.947]  And the globalists hope you get lost in all of it.
[01:58:34.308 --> 01:58:36.890]  But notice the globalists, the New World Order, are coming after us.
[01:58:37.211 --> 01:58:38.933]  Because they realize we've got their number.
[01:58:39.854 --> 01:58:40.314]  Think about it.
[01:58:40.675 --> 01:58:41.976]  InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:58:42.016 --> 01:58:43.898]  Do you want to support the tip of the spear?
[01:58:44.298 --> 01:58:45.460]  That decision is up to you.
[01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:46.521]  Please support us now.
[01:58:46.761 --> 01:58:47.342]  And it will restore.
[01:58:48.379 --> 01:58:50.140]  Real death is shutting off the economy.
[01:58:50.340 --> 01:58:52.662]  The bureaucrats and the corporations control the economy.
[01:58:52.982 --> 01:58:56.464]  As they vertically integrate the economy and consolidate power, they murder people en masse.
[01:58:57.085 --> 01:59:05.110]  Elon Musk has warned them that if you destroy civilization, you won't be able to have certain redoubts of it, certain city-states that still have it, the Hunger Games model.
[01:59:05.430 --> 01:59:09.753]  It will destroy the elite as well, and anybody that studies history and has common sense knows that.
[01:59:10.433 --> 01:59:15.415]  The wars that are going to come out of the starvation and the inflation are being blamed on global warming.
[01:59:15.635 --> 01:59:18.357]  The viruses that come out of the labs are being blamed on global warming.
[01:59:18.577 --> 01:59:22.018]  The third world hordes being organized by the UN to invade are being blamed on global warming.
[01:59:22.859 --> 01:59:24.559]  The mass starvation is blamed on the virus.
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.221]  And everywhere we're told it's going to get worse.
[01:59:28.321 --> 01:59:29.262]  Billions are coming.
[01:59:29.442 --> 01:59:31.763]  Al Gore and Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton.
[01:59:32.679 --> 01:59:39.824]  And the Rothschilds, and the Davos Group, and Bill Gates, and Klaus Schwab, and Yuval Noah Harari say billions are coming to Europe.
[01:59:40.044 --> 01:59:41.525]  A billion are coming to the U.S.
[01:59:41.986 --> 01:59:43.267]  because of climate change.
[01:59:43.787 --> 01:59:48.230]  No, because you cut their economy off because the IMF and World Bank controls the loans and ordered lockdowns.
[01:59:52.093 --> 01:59:56.016]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:27.749 --> 02:00:30.212]  Kirk Elliott's our guest, financial expert, Ph.D.
[02:00:30.292 --> 02:00:30.753]  on this stuff.
[02:00:30.773 --> 02:00:31.553]  Really smart guy.
[02:00:31.674 --> 02:00:32.995]  I've been wanting him on for a long time.
[02:00:33.455 --> 02:00:34.256]  Finally got him on.
[02:00:34.296 --> 02:00:36.679]  He's in studio with us for the second deal.
[02:00:36.699 --> 02:00:37.540]  This is a short segment.
[02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:38.681]  Some stations don't carry it.
[02:00:39.502 --> 02:00:43.085]  So give us a prelude now in part two about what you're about to cover.
[02:00:43.125 --> 02:00:44.427]  Then we'll go through the rest of it when we come back.
[02:00:45.919 --> 02:00:52.444]  So we're going to cover the timeline of central bank digital currency because a lot of people think this has just come upon us like recently.
[02:00:52.524 --> 02:00:53.284]  No, it hasn't.
[02:00:53.925 --> 02:00:55.325]  This has been worked on for a while.
[02:00:55.686 --> 02:01:05.533]  So going back to like August of 2019, this all started with a Federal Reserve docket where they talked about it, the FOMC, they talked about this.
[02:01:06.233 --> 02:01:08.495]  And then there was a patent by Visa.
[02:01:09.255 --> 02:01:10.796]  You know, our credit card, right?
[02:01:11.157 --> 02:01:17.963]  So that was I'm going to go over that, which is which is pretty scary stuff of what what they wanted.
[02:01:18.203 --> 02:01:18.403]  Right.
[02:01:18.463 --> 02:01:26.370]  So then you have Biden signed Executive Order 14067 that said, hey, and this was in 2022.
[02:01:26.410 --> 02:01:31.094]  It's like we're going to have central bank digital currency here in America.
[02:01:31.895 --> 02:01:35.357]  And then it becomes the full-on assault.
[02:01:35.717 --> 02:01:40.540]  World Economic Forum, Bank for International Settlements, Project Icebreaker, Project Aurora.
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:48.745]  We've got the United Nations talking about their endgame, which is the blueprint for a future monetary system.
[02:01:49.605 --> 02:01:52.327]  They talked about that in June of 2023.
[02:01:52.767 --> 02:01:55.489]  Well, what's the future dates that are going to be coming up?
[02:01:56.491 --> 02:01:58.353]  September 15th of 2024.
[02:01:58.914 --> 02:01:59.715]  Right?
[02:01:59.795 --> 02:02:02.337]  This is when they want all of this implemented.
[02:02:02.397 --> 02:02:03.158]  Not my words.
[02:02:03.519 --> 02:02:05.841]  It's not me speculating about any of this.
[02:02:06.341 --> 02:02:07.743]  It's their own words.
[02:02:08.464 --> 02:02:09.104]  And you know what?
[02:02:10.125 --> 02:02:15.611]  It's going to happen when they say that it's going to happen because they're the ones that are in charge.
[02:02:15.651 --> 02:02:18.554]  Now, it doesn't mean that we have to settle.
[02:02:19.215 --> 02:02:19.475]  For all
[02:02:39.103 --> 02:02:41.625]  to really counteract this federal system.
[02:02:42.066 --> 02:02:44.467]  And this is what the founding fathers envisioned, right?
[02:02:44.548 --> 02:02:46.269]  And under a federalist type system.
[02:02:46.349 --> 02:02:50.212]  Federalism doesn't mean you give all power to the federal government.
[02:02:50.252 --> 02:02:51.153]  That's not what it means.
[02:02:51.933 --> 02:02:54.875]  Federalism means separation of powers.
[02:02:54.975 --> 02:02:58.959]  So in a world where you have states
[02:02:59.719 --> 02:02:59.919]  Right?
[02:03:16.641 --> 02:03:16.861]  I think?
[02:03:38.295 --> 02:03:53.040]  Louisiana, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Utah, I mean there's a host of states that are now going down this road, and this is exciting, and this should make the founding fathers actually very excited, right?
[02:03:53.060 --> 02:04:04.243]  Because they're saying, yes, finally, we never wanted or envisioned a country, we warned against it, where money creation would be in the hands of a central bank, right?
[02:04:04.283 --> 02:04:07.564]  They wanted money creation to be in the hands of Congress.
[02:04:08.746 --> 02:04:14.107]  And even greater than that, like in states, because if states can do it, then the feds should not.
[02:04:14.847 --> 02:04:18.148]  Another great example of this would be like the Department of Education.
[02:04:18.768 --> 02:04:29.291]  No reason in the world why we should have a national department of education when states know the needs of their kids in school districts, in schools better
[02:04:30.251 --> 02:04:34.553]  Than a national government ever could, because they're too distant, right?
[02:04:34.613 --> 02:04:43.398]  So here's where we start to get separation of states with the federal government, and that system is starting to rise up.
[02:04:43.458 --> 02:04:47.780]  And this is going to be, I think, a really great alternative to the federal onslaught.
[02:04:47.800 --> 02:04:48.720]  All right, we've got to go to break.
[02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:49.381]  60 seconds.
[02:04:49.421 --> 02:04:50.981]  We're talking about solutions now.
[02:04:51.502 --> 02:04:52.422]  This is going down.
[02:04:52.462 --> 02:04:53.943]  You've got to get prepositioned now.
[02:04:59.382 --> 02:05:03.665]  29 years on air, all I wanted to do was warn the people about the globalists.
[02:05:04.365 --> 02:05:09.708]  And I've done the best job I can to tell the truth and be accurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[02:05:10.088 --> 02:05:17.433]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves, unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people, we don't do that.
[02:05:17.913 --> 02:05:19.794]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[02:05:20.174 --> 02:05:22.816]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product, it's so powerful.
[02:05:23.757 --> 02:05:28.743]  This is the breakdown product, after your cells process it, of folic acid.
[02:05:29.324 --> 02:05:33.810]  Methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[02:05:34.271 --> 02:05:35.493]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[02:05:35.533 --> 02:05:36.734]  It's not a stimulant.
[02:05:36.854 --> 02:05:38.457]  It energizes your cells.
[02:05:39.017 --> 02:05:41.499]  And then everything else you take just supercharges it.
[02:05:41.559 --> 02:05:42.400]  It's so insane.
[02:05:42.740 --> 02:05:44.261]  It's foundational energy.
[02:05:44.721 --> 02:05:48.864]  The strongest formula out there at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:05:49.245 --> 02:05:53.288]  It doesn't just energize this operation against the tyrants, it energizes you.
[02:05:53.568 --> 02:05:54.969]  Get foundational energy now!
[02:06:08.837 --> 02:06:08.958]  Yeah.
[02:06:39.418 --> 02:06:43.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are in an insane period right now in America.
[02:06:43.420 --> 02:06:47.202]  Kirk Elliott, multiple PhD, great advisor, is here.
[02:06:47.222 --> 02:06:51.605]  I've been wanting this guy on for years, and for some reason, both the cracks, and then he approached us.
[02:06:51.705 --> 02:06:52.826]  I'm like, I know that guy.
[02:06:52.926 --> 02:06:53.526]  Get him on.
[02:06:54.807 --> 02:06:55.607]  And he's dead on.
[02:06:55.647 --> 02:07:01.451]  So if you just joined us, or some stations just joined us, I want you, this is, we're going to skip the next break, you've got like 20-something minutes.
[02:07:02.931 --> 02:07:09.097]  To recap what you said, then get in to all the other notes you brought, the great research you did in preparation for this show.
[02:07:09.357 --> 02:07:13.280]  We really respect you and respect you respecting the show with the amount of preparation you did.
[02:07:14.621 --> 02:07:16.803]  The globalists are ending their old Ponzi scheme.
[02:07:16.823 --> 02:07:17.304]  They have to.
[02:07:18.178 --> 02:07:20.461]  And they're bringing in this new cashless society.
[02:07:20.561 --> 02:07:21.502]  It's all rolling out.
[02:07:21.942 --> 02:07:23.764]  They're going to decide what crises bring it in.
[02:07:23.805 --> 02:07:25.346]  They admit the crises are imminent.
[02:07:25.587 --> 02:07:26.387]  They've already begun.
[02:07:27.108 --> 02:07:33.415]  So we have to then understand God gave us knowledge so that we can persevere and triumph
[02:07:34.236 --> 02:07:44.048]  With the information and so we're not just telling you all this horrible news about 120 some percent of our money we make, so 20 plus percent over what we even make.
[02:07:44.448 --> 02:07:47.071]  All goes to debt, all goes to the fraud, all goes to the lie.
[02:07:47.532 --> 02:07:50.014]  Their system's going down, but the opportunity
[02:07:50.905 --> 02:07:51.465]  For liberty.
[02:07:51.906 --> 02:07:58.271]  And 1776, the more they squeeze, the more people wake up for states to have their own currencies, their own banks.
[02:07:58.331 --> 02:08:03.975]  For all these things to happen, this is going to be an incredible opportunity if you don't sit there like a victim.
[02:08:03.995 --> 02:08:08.959]  And I know our audience are not victims, but we've got to get pre-positioned.
[02:08:08.999 --> 02:08:10.861]  So, Dr. Elliott, please continue.
[02:08:12.446 --> 02:08:14.828]  So let's go into the timeline.
[02:08:15.408 --> 02:08:19.851]  Before I can give a solution, I have to kind of show where we're headed and how quickly.
[02:08:19.891 --> 02:08:22.533]  Because they have mapped out the timeline, Alex.
[02:08:22.613 --> 02:08:22.993]  Not us.
[02:08:23.273 --> 02:08:23.674]  And it's here.
[02:08:23.894 --> 02:08:24.334]  And it's here.
[02:08:24.474 --> 02:08:25.195]  And it's right now.
[02:08:25.275 --> 02:08:30.798]  So Central Bank Digital Currency, the ability to cut you off from buying or selling if your ideology doesn't match up with theirs.
[02:08:31.159 --> 02:08:32.259]  Their words, not mine.
[02:08:32.559 --> 02:08:34.601]  This started in August of 2019.
[02:08:36.002 --> 02:08:39.884]  So Federal Reserve docket OP1670.
[02:08:39.964 --> 02:08:40.665]  What does it say?
[02:08:40.705 --> 02:08:41.666]  I'm going to read it.
[02:08:41.866 --> 02:08:42.246]  Exactly.
[02:08:42.386 --> 02:08:42.746]  I don't know.
[02:09:06.786 --> 02:09:10.267]  The fourth definition of money, as a means of social control.
[02:09:11.027 --> 02:09:16.748]  Wow, and that's just like when they changed the definition of a vaccine, now to anything we inject into you, these definitions mean something.
[02:09:16.788 --> 02:09:17.469]  That is huge.
[02:09:18.269 --> 02:09:22.690]  Social control, which the head of BlackRock said repeatedly, we're using this for control.
[02:09:23.070 --> 02:09:23.270]  Yes.
[02:09:23.890 --> 02:09:25.490]  Has nothing to do with fixing a system.
[02:09:26.011 --> 02:09:29.551]  This in their own words, money is a means of social control.
[02:09:29.611 --> 02:09:31.732]  And to social control you, they gotta bring it to your knees.
[02:09:32.412 --> 02:09:38.737]  Yeah, because if you really wanted to control a person, Alex, you cut them off from buying or selling.
[02:09:38.837 --> 02:09:41.779]  Their ability to live, now you control that person.
[02:09:41.839 --> 02:09:48.164]  Now you've got a whole world of, or in America, 330 million economic slaves to you, right?
[02:09:48.244 --> 02:09:50.366]  So, now... You've got 20 minutes.
[02:09:50.406 --> 02:09:51.287]  I'm going to stop interrupting.
[02:09:51.447 --> 02:09:52.327]  You just showed that on.
[02:09:52.888 --> 02:09:53.308]  Give it to us.
[02:09:54.514 --> 02:09:58.578]  11-8 of 2019, a patent was filed, 62-758430.
[02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:02.081]  Who did this?
[02:10:02.401 --> 02:10:04.543]  Visa, the credit card company.
[02:10:05.084 --> 02:10:06.225]  What is their patent?
[02:10:06.965 --> 02:10:17.856]  It basically, people can go look it up, but basically it talks about how this patent, they want to change money from paper to digital money.
[02:10:18.456 --> 02:10:24.379]  And every new digital currency that's created, digital currency unit, they're going to take out a paper currency unit.
[02:10:24.479 --> 02:10:24.779]  Why?
[02:10:25.439 --> 02:10:29.461]  Because you can't track a private paper money.
[02:10:29.942 --> 02:10:34.184]  You can go to a farmer's market, you can go anywhere, nobody knows that you're spending money if you use paper.
[02:10:34.504 --> 02:10:36.505]  But they can track everything if it's digital.
[02:10:36.545 --> 02:10:40.047]  So to bring in a digital system, they have to get rid of the old.
[02:10:40.307 --> 02:10:42.568]  They're getting rid of their private-based currency.
[02:10:42.808 --> 02:10:44.909]  Now, it goes a little bit further.
[02:10:46.010 --> 02:10:48.051]  323 of 2020, H.R.
[02:10:48.071 --> 02:10:48.051]  6321.
[02:10:48.271 --> 02:10:52.454]  Okay, Maxine Waters is responsible for this one.
[02:10:52.554 --> 02:10:59.279]  So, Financial Protections and Assistance for Americans, Consumers, States, Businesses, and Vulnerable Populations Act.
[02:10:59.359 --> 02:11:00.579]  This is what this is called.
[02:11:01.180 --> 02:11:02.281]  So, what is it?
[02:11:03.061 --> 02:11:07.704]  It's direct stimulus payments for families, for renters, for homeowners.
[02:11:09.305 --> 02:11:10.145]  Universal basic income.
[02:11:10.525 --> 02:11:10.925]  Correct.
[02:11:11.006 --> 02:11:12.126]  It's exactly what it is.
[02:11:12.666 --> 02:11:14.406]  Now, what is required for that?
[02:11:14.706 --> 02:11:16.427]  Number one, a digital dollar.
[02:11:16.587 --> 02:11:18.247]  Number two, a digital dollar wallet.
[02:11:18.327 --> 02:11:23.469]  Number three, a member bank that will actually accept digital dollars.
[02:11:23.909 --> 02:11:24.629]  So here's the thing.
[02:11:24.969 --> 02:11:28.750]  If you want to receive the government stimulus, you have to have a digital dollar.
[02:11:28.770 --> 02:11:30.090]  There is no other option.
[02:11:30.410 --> 02:11:32.191]  Now extend that out a little bit further.
[02:11:32.811 --> 02:11:37.077]  If you want Social Security, well they've already passed a bill that says if you want stimulus.
[02:11:37.317 --> 02:11:38.198]  What about Social Security?
[02:11:38.238 --> 02:11:39.440]  What about government pensions?
[02:11:39.460 --> 02:11:41.302]  What about any kind of government payment?
[02:11:41.883 --> 02:11:42.464]  Retirement?
[02:11:42.604 --> 02:11:43.024]  Anything?
[02:11:43.425 --> 02:11:47.190]  If you want it, you have to be part of that beast system.
[02:11:47.210 --> 02:11:47.891]  And it's already!
[02:11:48.471 --> 02:11:49.172]  And it's already.
[02:11:49.872 --> 02:11:56.778]  So, you know, as I read through the Bible as a kid and as an adult, it's like, how in the world could this Antichrist and the Mark of the Beast happen?
[02:11:56.818 --> 02:11:58.120]  People know that it was coming.
[02:11:58.460 --> 02:12:02.203]  Well, even Christians... And you have a degree in theology on top of that.
[02:12:02.243 --> 02:12:02.483]  Yeah.
[02:12:02.763 --> 02:12:05.386]  So in this sense, it's like, oh, it clicked.
[02:12:05.786 --> 02:12:07.127]  It makes sense.
[02:12:07.267 --> 02:12:14.954]  Even Christians, if they say, I don't get my retirement, I don't get any payments unless I take the system, I guess I might as well take the system.
[02:12:15.334 --> 02:12:17.376]  So this is revelation actually happening?
[02:12:17.496 --> 02:12:18.757]  I believe that it is, yeah.
[02:12:18.897 --> 02:12:23.440]  I mean, if it looks like a duck, smells like a duck, walks like a duck, it's probably a duck, right?
[02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:29.904]  And these are in their own words, the ability to cut you off from buying or selling if they don't like your ideology.
[02:12:29.964 --> 02:12:30.945]  I don't know what else it is.
[02:12:31.485 --> 02:12:34.847]  So then... Because they say, to control behavior, ideology.
[02:12:35.028 --> 02:12:35.428]  Wow!
[02:12:35.668 --> 02:12:35.848]  Yeah.
[02:12:36.288 --> 02:12:39.250]  So then here's where it starts to actually, the rubber hits the road.
[02:12:39.491 --> 02:12:42.052]  March 6th of 2022, Executive Order 14067, Biden penned it.
[02:12:44.534 --> 02:12:44.754]  Right?
[02:12:44.934 --> 02:12:49.135]  It's basically that says we're going to have central bank digital currency in America.
[02:12:49.596 --> 02:12:53.177]  March 29, 2022, they start to talk about the ideology.
[02:12:53.217 --> 02:12:56.197]  Dr. Pippa Malmgren at the World Government Forum in Abu Dhabi.
[02:12:56.678 --> 02:12:57.298]  What did she say?
[02:12:57.358 --> 02:13:01.479]  She said programmable money is the core of central bank digital currency.
[02:13:01.779 --> 02:13:06.580]  Programmable, meaning if we don't like you, we can flip the switch so you can actually have your money.
[02:13:06.620 --> 02:13:08.121]  That's what programmable money means.
[02:13:08.701 --> 02:13:10.261]  Then you go to March of 2023, the United Nations
[02:13:12.182 --> 02:13:14.684]  Our Common Agenda Policy Brief, right?
[02:13:14.764 --> 02:13:34.421]  So, here's where the UN General Secretary says, I propose that the General Assembly provide the Secretary General and the United Nations system with a standing authority to convene and operationalize automatically an emergency platform in the event of a future complex global shock of sufficient scale, severity, and reach.
[02:13:34.621 --> 02:13:36.843]  Wow, they're telling you we're going to use a crisis to do this?
[02:13:36.943 --> 02:13:37.263]  Correct.
[02:13:37.383 --> 02:13:39.285]  Jump one train from one track to the next?
[02:13:39.505 --> 02:13:39.745]  Yes.
[02:13:39.805 --> 02:13:40.966]  And then blow up the old track.
[02:13:41.086 --> 02:13:43.408]  Yeah, they just said, so what was that first crisis?
[02:13:44.509 --> 02:13:44.889]  COVID.
[02:13:45.709 --> 02:13:46.770]  What's the second crisis?
[02:13:47.110 --> 02:13:47.791]  Bank failure.
[02:13:48.171 --> 02:13:49.292]  What's the third crisis?
[02:13:49.732 --> 02:13:52.514]  Something worse than COVID on a health scale or war?
[02:13:52.554 --> 02:13:52.994]  Civil War.
[02:13:53.395 --> 02:13:55.796]  I mean, so here's where... A new COVID, yeah.
[02:13:56.057 --> 02:14:02.821]  They tell us, I mean, they tell us what could trigger... That's what's crazy is they always act like they're the adults at the big table at Thanksgiving.
[02:14:02.841 --> 02:14:03.502]  We're the little kids.
[02:14:03.822 --> 02:14:05.043]  That's why I'm so flustered.
[02:14:05.063 --> 02:14:06.184]  How does Jones know this?
[02:14:06.804 --> 02:14:07.624]  Is he one of them?
[02:14:07.705 --> 02:14:07.945]  No!
[02:14:08.025 --> 02:14:09.265]  They write white papers!
[02:14:09.666 --> 02:14:14.768]  Like Operation Lockstep in 2010 told the whole plan for the COVID takeover!
[02:14:15.008 --> 02:14:16.589]  Yeah, I research like you do.
[02:14:16.629 --> 02:14:19.871]  It's like, I'm not making stuff up, I just read what they say.
[02:14:19.891 --> 02:14:21.792]  Please people, I'm not that special!
[02:14:22.492 --> 02:14:28.235]  You know, I mean, we're hard-working and we know how to read it, but I mean, Dr. Elliott here, he's just telling you, here it is!
[02:14:28.675 --> 02:14:29.836]  He's reading their documents!
[02:14:30.336 --> 02:14:35.061]  So, you go to the next paragraph in this agenda policy brief.
[02:14:35.501 --> 02:14:37.523]  What could trigger the emergency authority?
[02:14:37.543 --> 02:14:48.714]  A major climatic event, a future pandemic risk, a global digital connectivity disruption, a major event in outer space, and a generic unforeseen risk like a black flare event.
[02:14:48.734 --> 02:14:49.395]  That's a solar flare.
[02:14:49.435 --> 02:14:51.417]  The solar flare is the outer space still.
[02:14:51.577 --> 02:14:51.737]  Yeah.
[02:14:51.757 --> 02:14:53.939]  What's the hype in the daylights out of?
[02:14:54.680 --> 02:15:06.003]  So here's where it says, at the end of it, it also states that while the emergency authority would have an initial finite lifespan, the UN could be able to extend it indefinitely.
[02:15:06.203 --> 02:15:08.664]  Oh, a permanent UN emergency!
[02:15:08.864 --> 02:15:09.684]  Oh my God!
[02:15:09.984 --> 02:15:11.205]  That's the headline for the show.
[02:15:11.565 --> 02:15:15.066]  Financial expert exposes UN documents.
[02:15:17.125 --> 02:15:23.271]  Documents UN planning permanent financial emergency to establish Mark of the Beast.
[02:15:23.451 --> 02:15:24.412]  What do we call this interview?
[02:15:24.432 --> 02:15:25.613]  Because the headline's everything.
[02:15:25.894 --> 02:15:31.840]  Like, they're literally the UN war gaming a permanent emergency global Mark of the Beast?
[02:15:31.900 --> 02:15:32.420]  Or how would you?
[02:15:33.081 --> 02:15:35.221]  I mean, they're proud about it.
[02:15:35.902 --> 02:15:44.203]  They're saying, we're going to use these emergencies to bring in a cashless society that controls every aspect of your life and tells you where you can spend the money.
[02:15:44.323 --> 02:15:45.764]  And separate you from your money.
[02:15:45.924 --> 02:15:46.564]  Exactly right.
[02:15:46.604 --> 02:15:47.644]  That's what they're telling us.
[02:15:47.684 --> 02:15:49.765]  And they're going to use a crisis to get us to that point.
[02:15:49.805 --> 02:15:52.125]  So we willingly give up those freedoms.
[02:15:52.645 --> 02:15:56.666]  Now, March 6th of 2023, Bank for International Settlements, Project Icebreaker.
[02:15:57.166 --> 02:15:59.727]  Go to BIS.org and look it up.
[02:16:00.367 --> 02:16:08.149]  So, the ability to not authorize bank wires if the use of funds doesn't match up with their ideology.
[02:16:08.209 --> 02:16:08.869]  There they set it.
[02:16:08.909 --> 02:16:09.650]  The ESGs.
[02:16:09.930 --> 02:16:10.170]  Yes.
[02:16:10.670 --> 02:16:14.371]  May 31st of 2023, Bank for International Settlements, Project Aurora.
[02:16:14.751 --> 02:16:19.532]  Real-time transaction monitoring of all transactions of all people of all banks in every country.
[02:16:19.872 --> 02:16:20.693]  Why do they need that?
[02:16:20.713 --> 02:16:21.353]  That's from the UN!
[02:16:22.333 --> 02:16:24.414]  No, that's from the Bank for International Settlements.
[02:16:24.434 --> 02:16:25.254]  Which is on top of it.
[02:16:25.374 --> 02:16:25.714]  Correct.
[02:16:26.154 --> 02:16:28.975]  So, they're saying we need real-time transaction monitoring.
[02:16:29.015 --> 02:16:29.275]  Why?
[02:16:29.355 --> 02:16:31.516]  To see if your ideology matches up with that.
[02:16:31.876 --> 02:16:32.116]  Why?
[02:16:32.196 --> 02:16:35.877]  Because they can cut off wires from bank to bank if they don't like you.
[02:16:36.337 --> 02:16:36.577]  Why?
[02:16:36.657 --> 02:16:46.080]  Because if your social credit score, if your ESG, if your digital social profile doesn't match up like what Dr. Pippa Malmgren said, we can shut you off with... So this is a financial dictatorship.
[02:16:46.420 --> 02:16:47.341]  Financial Dictatorship.
[02:16:47.361 --> 02:16:48.081]  Run by AI.
[02:16:48.281 --> 02:16:48.502]  Yes.
[02:16:48.882 --> 02:16:51.164]  Now here's where it gets even creepier, Alex.
[02:16:51.244 --> 02:16:55.807]  I feel like the old cheesy, you know, game show host, like, okay, behind door number three, there's even more.
[02:16:55.827 --> 02:16:56.547]  But it gets worse.
[02:16:56.668 --> 02:16:57.048]  It does.
[02:16:57.488 --> 02:17:06.995]  So June 20th of 2023, blueprint for the future monetary system, improving the old, enabling the new, a unified ledger, meaning all of your assets.
[02:17:07.275 --> 02:17:08.976]  See, this goes back to that.
[02:17:08.996 --> 02:17:10.938]  Surveilled in one spot in lifetime.
[02:17:11.178 --> 02:17:13.219]  Yeah, tokenization is what this is all about.
[02:17:13.239 --> 02:17:14.159]  Total rape of your privacy.
[02:17:14.239 --> 02:17:25.224]  So, all of your mutual funds, all of your checking accounts, savings accounts, all of your brokerage accounts, tokenize, pack it into one packet, where they can flip of a switch, change ownership.
[02:17:25.684 --> 02:17:27.625]  That's what a unified ledger is.
[02:17:27.845 --> 02:17:32.267]  And just like they've been caught with the derivatives of selling mortgages a hundred times, they're going to do all this.
[02:17:33.047 --> 02:17:35.328]  Well, and so they can.
[02:17:35.708 --> 02:17:41.791]  And even a house, if you had a house paid for, do you really think you own the house in America if you have it paid for?
[02:17:41.811 --> 02:17:42.371]  No, they sold it.
[02:17:43.151 --> 02:17:49.854]  So their answer, instead of going to prison because they've secretly sold your house even though you own it, is to just say under international law we can do it.
[02:17:50.875 --> 02:17:51.895]  Under a UN emergency.
[02:17:54.196 --> 02:17:56.959]  It's wild, but let's say you didn't pay your property tax.
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.803]  You own your house, but you don't pay your property tax.
[02:17:59.843 --> 02:18:00.444]  What happens?
[02:18:00.504 --> 02:18:02.366]  It goes to a tax auction lien.
[02:18:11.016 --> 02:18:16.621]  And somebody could buy your house from underneath you and you lose the title to it because you don't technically own it.
[02:18:16.661 --> 02:18:20.425]  Well, what if they say the only way to pay your taxes is through this Mark of the Beast system?
[02:18:20.445 --> 02:18:22.287]  You say, I'm not going to participate in that system.
[02:18:22.307 --> 02:18:23.308]  Well, then you might lose your house.
[02:18:23.328 --> 02:18:25.570]  I mean, this is where it gets crazy.
[02:18:25.650 --> 02:18:28.593]  So they gave the future timeline here, Alex.
[02:18:29.814 --> 02:18:32.196]  June, September, I'm sorry, September 15th of 2024.
[02:18:32.336 --> 02:18:33.237]  In these documents, they say
[02:18:36.300 --> 02:18:42.944]  The Global Vision for the Future, where biometric ID is tied to all bank accounts, that is their deadline.
[02:18:42.984 --> 02:18:44.986]  So they're planning it right before the election?
[02:18:45.446 --> 02:18:47.007]  Right before the election.
[02:18:47.207 --> 02:18:47.487]  Wow!
[02:18:47.507 --> 02:18:48.088]  Crazy, right?
[02:18:48.588 --> 02:18:50.669]  And they planned this a long time ago.
[02:18:51.070 --> 02:18:57.954]  September 22nd through 24th of this year, again right before, they're going to have this big confab somewhere, probably in China.
[02:18:58.795 --> 02:19:03.778]  UN Pact for the Future, this is where the globalists are going to share their commenced plan
[02:19:04.298 --> 02:19:07.300]  To save the world from who knows what, right?
[02:19:08.260 --> 02:19:12.702]  So this is where, how do they get this done?
[02:19:12.922 --> 02:19:14.383]  They have to kick the U.S.
[02:19:14.443 --> 02:19:16.144]  dollar out of the sandbox, right?
[02:19:16.504 --> 02:19:16.924]  The U.S.
[02:19:16.944 --> 02:19:18.665]  dollar is still the world's reserve currency.
[02:19:18.985 --> 02:19:22.187]  All international settlements of oil, the petrodollar, are traded in U.S.
[02:19:22.207 --> 02:19:22.347]  dollars.
[02:19:22.367 --> 02:19:23.287]  And people think they'll never do it.
[02:19:23.327 --> 02:19:24.308]  No, they'll do it for this.
[02:19:24.808 --> 02:19:25.928]  This gives them total control.
[02:19:26.389 --> 02:19:28.730]  And the same bankers will control this to control the dollar.
[02:19:29.170 --> 02:19:29.390]  Yeah.
[02:19:29.610 --> 02:19:31.772]  So people think, oh, they won't do that, the dollars are power.
[02:19:31.852 --> 02:19:33.073]  No, they're going to their real power.
[02:19:33.253 --> 02:19:37.617]  Well, and you stated this earlier in the show when you were showing the U.N.
[02:19:37.737 --> 02:19:41.340]  CREPO, who was saying Trump is going to end the global order, right?
[02:19:41.380 --> 02:19:42.581]  He's going to make it real difficult.
[02:19:43.382 --> 02:19:43.982]  The U.S.
[02:19:44.042 --> 02:19:46.344]  dollar is still the dominant currency.
[02:19:46.544 --> 02:19:49.527]  We have been since 1944 when we were the world's reserve currency.
[02:19:51.208 --> 02:19:51.768]  Bretton Woods.
[02:19:52.049 --> 02:19:53.069]  But this is diminishing.
[02:19:53.470 --> 02:20:00.134]  On August 22nd through August 24th, when the BRICS nations met in South Africa, they did one thing, and Putin said it.
[02:20:00.234 --> 02:20:02.116]  He said, I'm going to de-dollarize the world.
[02:20:02.196 --> 02:20:03.877]  It's my objective and it's irreversible.
[02:20:04.277 --> 02:20:05.258]  Well, how did they do that?
[02:20:05.278 --> 02:20:06.819]  Because those are fighting words there.
[02:20:07.239 --> 02:20:16.106]  They added United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Argentina to the BRICS nations starting January 1st, so just two weeks ago.
[02:20:16.846 --> 02:20:21.930]  So now, 70% of the world's population is trading in some currency other than the U.S.
[02:20:21.990 --> 02:20:22.291]  dollar.
[02:20:22.591 --> 02:20:24.893]  We have lost our demand for currency.
[02:20:25.273 --> 02:20:27.095]  Therefore, we're going to have to print our way out of it.
[02:20:27.135 --> 02:20:28.876]  We go into an inflationary spiral.
[02:20:28.896 --> 02:20:31.598]  They're going to have to raise rates to slow down that inflation.
[02:20:31.638 --> 02:20:33.420]  This is just economics 101 type stuff.
[02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:39.125]  And they're going to need a global crisis of expanded war, new viruses, race war as the pretext to make us behave.
[02:20:39.545 --> 02:20:45.446]  Yes, and a pretext for us to say, okay, we'll give you what you want, we'll give you our freedoms, take care of us.
[02:20:45.506 --> 02:20:47.427]  So, how do you protect yourself from that?
[02:20:47.767 --> 02:20:50.648]  This is what I've been shouting from the rooftops for decades.
[02:20:50.688 --> 02:20:51.408]  You read my mind.
[02:20:51.868 --> 02:21:05.511]  Gold, silver, guns, friends, family, a relationship with God, knowing people you can trust, land, but in the future, and all the governments know this, they're buying, I know private people in government, they're all buying gold and silver.
[02:21:05.811 --> 02:21:06.512]  They've been hoarding it.
[02:21:06.552 --> 02:21:07.072]  Why is that?
[02:21:07.392 --> 02:21:08.012]  And how do people get it?
[02:21:08.712 --> 02:21:10.013]  Well, it's because it's real.
[02:21:10.093 --> 02:21:11.153]  It's because it's tangible.
[02:21:11.193 --> 02:21:12.754]  It has authenticity to it.
[02:21:12.794 --> 02:21:14.415]  It's not something, like, fake.
[02:21:14.855 --> 02:21:16.256]  It's not phony baloney stuff.
[02:21:16.296 --> 02:21:17.316]  It's not something digital.
[02:21:17.656 --> 02:21:19.037]  If you want to... It's like a prison.
[02:21:19.097 --> 02:21:24.259]  Cigarettes, or, or, or, or, or, honey buns, or the currency, because that's a real thing.
[02:21:24.499 --> 02:21:25.260]  It's a real thing.
[02:21:25.780 --> 02:21:32.885]  Yeah, and so if you want to get out of being a digital slave in their digital world, you have to have something that's real, right?
[02:21:32.925 --> 02:21:35.947]  So silver, for example, you could use it for barter.
[02:21:36.288 --> 02:21:39.070]  You could trade it back and forth if a currency collapsed and people don't want it.
[02:21:39.130 --> 02:21:42.412]  Merchants don't want it because they believe the new system is the mark of the beast.
[02:21:42.792 --> 02:21:43.653]  You better have something.
[02:21:43.673 --> 02:21:44.614]  But outside of that,
[02:21:45.234 --> 02:21:46.615]  It's just something that's real.
[02:21:46.695 --> 02:21:47.875]  It's something that's tangible.
[02:21:47.916 --> 02:21:51.678]  It's something that they can't take if it's a private transaction.
[02:21:51.698 --> 02:21:52.458]  No, I totally agree.
[02:21:52.658 --> 02:21:54.879]  If I had money right now, I'd be all in gold and silver.
[02:21:55.420 --> 02:21:57.461]  And, you know, some speculation in crypto and things.
[02:21:57.501 --> 02:22:00.722]  But, I mean, it's going to be real, tangible stuff that isn't surveilled.
[02:22:00.742 --> 02:22:03.124]  Like, until 20 years ago, TV didn't watch you.
[02:22:03.224 --> 02:22:03.804]  You watched it.
[02:22:04.064 --> 02:22:04.925]  Now everything's watched.
[02:22:05.325 --> 02:22:06.265]  Everything you do is two-way.
[02:22:06.305 --> 02:22:06.786]  Think about that.
[02:22:08.660 --> 02:22:11.602]  Well, how do you flip somebody off the switch?
[02:22:24.011 --> 02:22:26.812]  from them not owning their asset if it's something that's real.
[02:22:26.852 --> 02:22:27.732]  It's not digital.
[02:22:27.952 --> 02:22:28.453]  You can't.
[02:22:28.593 --> 02:22:31.174]  It's not really that easy to do for them.
[02:22:31.514 --> 02:22:38.736]  If you have paper, if you have something that's digital, if your checking account is at Chase or Bank of America, it's like, okay, we'll flip the switch.
[02:22:38.776 --> 02:22:39.677]  We all know what it is.
[02:22:39.797 --> 02:22:41.897]  It's very easy to do because it's electronic.
[02:22:42.518 --> 02:22:44.518]  Gold and silver ownership in physical form.
[02:22:44.598 --> 02:22:45.939]  I'm not talking about ETFs.
[02:22:46.179 --> 02:22:47.479]  I'm not talking about mining shares.
[02:22:47.559 --> 02:22:49.040]  I'm not talking about stocks.
[02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:53.464]  No, that's why I wanted to get you as a sponsor, but you don't even remember what a talk about your company is.
[02:22:53.504 --> 02:22:54.505]  You just say, no, bullion.
[02:22:54.865 --> 02:22:55.206]  Bullion.
[02:22:55.546 --> 02:22:58.389]  And I'm not... I told my crew over and over again, I want a bullion company.
[02:22:58.669 --> 02:23:00.971]  And we get the companies, and I always dub them in like a week.
[02:23:01.252 --> 02:23:04.355]  They go, yeah, we promise only bullion with a little market pair bill.
[02:23:04.375 --> 02:23:04.975]  I go, that's fine.
[02:23:05.235 --> 02:23:07.337]  They instantly go with numismatic or stocks.
[02:23:07.357 --> 02:23:11.261]  And I say, no, I want people to have bullion, and that's why I've not had a gold sponsor in years.
[02:23:12.402 --> 02:23:15.204]  And we don't recommend that garbage.
[02:23:15.464 --> 02:23:19.027]  We don't recommend high-grade, semi-numismatic, collectible.
[02:23:19.347 --> 02:23:22.069]  The word numismatic, it means it's rare, right?
[02:23:22.610 --> 02:23:24.791]  They come with high commission, high premium.
[02:23:25.252 --> 02:23:33.398]  In almost 30 years of doing this, Alex, I've never known a client that actually has recovered from those high premiums, which is why we focus on bullion.
[02:23:33.438 --> 02:23:34.158]  Now, what's bullion?
[02:23:34.578 --> 02:23:39.462]  It's low-cost metals that are used for global commodities, right?
[02:23:39.822 --> 02:23:40.282]  100 ounce bars of silver.
[02:23:40.302 --> 02:23:42.743]  They're in all the microchips, they're in all the batteries, it's everywhere.
[02:23:42.843 --> 02:23:43.324]  Exactly.
[02:23:43.344 --> 02:23:47.565]  10 ounce bars of silver, 1 ounce silver rounds, gold bars, gold kilo bars.
[02:23:47.745 --> 02:23:48.706]  That's it.
[02:23:48.726 --> 02:23:52.767]  In all of the universe of all the metals you could have, I can fit it onto one hand.
[02:23:53.248 --> 02:23:54.208]  Five different things.
[02:23:54.268 --> 02:23:56.129]  If it's not one of those, you shouldn't buy them.
[02:23:56.209 --> 02:23:56.469]  Why?
[02:23:56.829 --> 02:24:03.492]  The premiums are low, the commissions are low, and what we do that's different than other firms is we don't charge a commission when you liquidate.
[02:24:03.932 --> 02:24:07.535]  So whatever the depository is paying for it, that's all yours, right?
[02:24:07.555 --> 02:24:09.556]  Because I want your exit strategy.
[02:24:09.716 --> 02:24:18.903]  It's more important than your entrance strategy because if you're paying a commission on the back end and something is doubled, tripled, quadrupled, or even more, well that becomes really expensive.
[02:24:19.404 --> 02:24:21.966]  So what we do is we eliminate
[02:24:22.606 --> 02:24:23.986]  Any kind of commission on the back end.
[02:24:24.427 --> 02:24:26.687]  We don't charge fees for assets under management.
[02:24:27.127 --> 02:24:29.928]  Low cost of ownership going in with bullion.
[02:24:30.248 --> 02:24:34.709]  See, if you're buying something that's rare, somebody has to make a market for it.
[02:24:34.749 --> 02:24:40.731]  No, it's just a straight up transaction and advisory fee, and then you get it, and you've got people, it's no games.
[02:24:41.391 --> 02:24:46.213]  Yeah, it's just a one-time cost of ownership when you purchase it, that's it.
[02:24:46.653 --> 02:24:52.096]  See, if we were selling something rare and you wanted to liquidate it, there's not necessarily a market for that.
[02:24:52.116 --> 02:24:52.776]  You have to find the buyer.
[02:24:52.936 --> 02:24:57.378]  We would have to call and say... There's an instant gold and silver at bullion price.
[02:24:57.718 --> 02:25:06.582]  Yeah, I'll call the depository, 45 seconds, we lock in the price because it's a global commodity, manufacturers all over the world, Sony, Samsung, Tesla, LG, you name it.
[02:25:06.702 --> 02:25:08.723]  And they're only scaling up gold and silver.
[02:25:09.463 --> 02:25:10.644]  Are you guys in copper?
[02:25:10.684 --> 02:25:11.204]  I'm no expert.
[02:25:11.244 --> 02:25:11.965]  I say that's exploding.
[02:25:12.305 --> 02:25:16.728]  No, it's real difficult to own that unless you're doing it through futures contracts.
[02:25:16.848 --> 02:25:20.951]  You could have a whole garage full of copper and it's worth like $10,000, right?
[02:25:21.272 --> 02:25:24.114]  But it's so gold and silver, the meat and potatoes.
[02:25:24.134 --> 02:25:25.155]  It's more portable.
[02:25:25.235 --> 02:25:25.815]  It's a real deal.
[02:25:26.115 --> 02:25:26.756]  Exactly.
[02:25:27.728 --> 02:25:29.049]  I just see all the metals exploding.
[02:25:29.629 --> 02:25:31.471]  Because under inflation, that's going to happen, right?
[02:25:31.711 --> 02:25:41.017]  Everything that's tangible, whether it's growth... Whether it's firewood, whether it's eggs, bullets... All of that goes up during times of inflation because they're things.
[02:25:41.197 --> 02:25:42.618]  Things go up with inflation.
[02:25:42.978 --> 02:25:45.000]  Gold and silver happen to be things.
[02:25:45.320 --> 02:25:50.844]  So they are your best insurance policy against a collapsing currency in an inflationary environment.
[02:25:51.264 --> 02:25:54.026]  You can protect and preserve, grow and thrive.
[02:25:54.466 --> 02:25:57.188]  By getting out of the system, going into something that's real.
[02:25:57.228 --> 02:26:00.451]  Now you can do it in IRAs or you can do it outside of an IRA.
[02:26:00.751 --> 02:26:09.519]  So 70% of our business is clients doing IRA rollovers from their existing paper, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, into tangible assets.
[02:26:09.579 --> 02:26:17.345]  Now it's not paper, we are storing metals in your IRA, physical bars and coins to actually get people out of that
[02:26:18.226 --> 02:26:18.707]  We're good to go.
[02:26:37.409 --> 02:26:39.411]  Uh, and friends and family and being ready.
[02:26:39.771 --> 02:26:40.972]  And I hate to be the killjoy.
[02:26:40.992 --> 02:26:42.292]  Like, I was over at my parents' this Sunday.
[02:26:42.312 --> 02:26:43.253]  They were watching football.
[02:26:43.273 --> 02:26:44.534]  And they already know all this stuff.
[02:26:44.574 --> 02:26:45.534]  Hell, before I was born.
[02:26:45.555 --> 02:26:48.216]  And they're just like, well, you know, we're here.
[02:26:48.276 --> 02:26:49.057]  God'll protect us.
[02:26:49.097 --> 02:26:49.237]  But...
[02:26:50.387 --> 02:26:52.868]  God protects those who protect themselves.
[02:26:52.928 --> 02:26:53.988]  God takes care of those.
[02:26:54.348 --> 02:26:56.189]  He gave us a brain to take care of ourselves.
[02:26:56.809 --> 02:26:58.169]  And people need to get ready.
[02:26:58.509 --> 02:27:00.550]  So you have your Kirk Elliott Ph.D.
[02:27:00.570 --> 02:27:02.730]  website, but I said, hey, how about a quicker site that's easier?
[02:27:03.130 --> 02:27:13.573]  It's K-E-P-M, just K-E-P-M, just all caps, K-E-P-M.com forward slash gold or 720-605-3900.
[02:27:13.593 --> 02:27:15.574]  And people ask, why have you not promoted gold?
[02:27:20.563 --> 02:27:24.226]  I predicted when they were going to manipulate the market, you know, 12, 13 years ago, that I got out of it.
[02:27:24.526 --> 02:27:33.934]  And then I've tried to get back the last four or five years, but couldn't find any good companies that I would trust that were just giving you gold and bullion, gold and silver bullion, and that gave you great advice at the same time.
[02:27:34.394 --> 02:27:38.078]  And I'm literally one of the Skyline's guests and then found out all this other stuff.
[02:27:38.378 --> 02:27:41.901]  So this is an actual answer to prayer.
[02:27:43.084 --> 02:27:44.445]  Dr. Kirk Elliott, thank you so much.
[02:27:44.545 --> 02:27:48.508]  KEMP.com forward slash gold or 720-605-3900.
[02:27:48.588 --> 02:27:49.428]  We've got a minute to break.
[02:27:49.448 --> 02:27:49.969]  Closing comments.
[02:27:54.468 --> 02:28:00.071]  Yeah, here's where I don't want people to hear this and just be gripped with fear.
[02:28:00.611 --> 02:28:01.052]  Don't be.
[02:28:01.492 --> 02:28:02.352]  There's a solution.
[02:28:02.392 --> 02:28:05.754]  You know, God never told us that life was going to be easy.
[02:28:05.774 --> 02:28:07.415]  He just told us that he'd take care of us.
[02:28:07.475 --> 02:28:08.295]  Fear does two things.
[02:28:08.375 --> 02:28:11.637]  It either causes you to not act or it causes you to make the wrong decision.
[02:28:12.037 --> 02:28:13.878]  But instead, act out of confidence.
[02:28:13.938 --> 02:28:14.539]  Act out of faith.
[02:28:14.619 --> 02:28:15.479]  Take that leap of faith.
[02:28:15.519 --> 02:28:16.080]  Give us a call.
[02:28:16.320 --> 02:28:17.160]  We'll walk you through it.
[02:28:17.180 --> 02:28:18.741]  We'll hold your hand through this economy.
[02:28:19.201 --> 02:28:22.363]  We will help you navigate through this financial crisis.
[02:28:22.383 --> 02:28:23.964]  I only fear people and stuff that my gut
[02:28:24.425 --> 02:28:25.607]  And my spirit says it's good.
[02:28:25.928 --> 02:28:27.853]  You guys have great gold and silver at Bullion.
[02:28:28.254 --> 02:28:30.921]  That to me is, nothing's perfect, but this is the safest bet.
[02:28:31.607 --> 02:28:32.748]  It's a safe bet.
[02:28:32.908 --> 02:28:34.029]  And we're not God.
[02:28:34.229 --> 02:28:35.430]  We don't control the markets.
[02:28:35.910 --> 02:28:36.530]  You're not God.
[02:28:36.570 --> 02:28:37.651]  You don't control the markets.
[02:28:37.731 --> 02:28:42.314]  But what we do is we can analyze the trends, use their own words, and operate.
[02:28:42.414 --> 02:28:44.136]  I wish I had some money in gold and silver.
[02:28:44.956 --> 02:28:46.097]  I lost it all in my divorce.
[02:28:46.217 --> 02:28:46.897]  I have nothing.
[02:28:48.158 --> 02:28:49.859]  It's okay, I got God, but I'm in the fight.
[02:28:49.899 --> 02:28:50.540]  You've got God.
[02:28:50.580 --> 02:28:53.862]  You're in the midst of a huge fight, and we're glad to help you.
[02:28:54.182 --> 02:28:55.603]  Dr. Elliott, thank you so much.
[02:28:55.703 --> 02:28:56.384]  Amazing job.
[02:28:57.694 --> 02:29:01.917]  The second American revolution is happening now right in front of you.
[02:29:02.237 --> 02:29:06.600]  And you're tuned in to InfoWars because you're either looking for the truth or you're already a patriot.
[02:29:07.060 --> 02:29:14.906]  I'm asking you now to realize we are at the fulcrum, the crossroads, in the fight for human destiny and human future.
[02:29:15.566 --> 02:29:17.288]  Please spread the word about the broadcast.
[02:29:17.748 --> 02:29:23.013]  Please buy great products at FortWorthStore.com and please pray for the transmission.
[02:29:23.293 --> 02:29:24.475]  Without you, we're going to fail.
[02:29:24.915 --> 02:29:33.984]  But if you simply take action and spread the word and pray for the broadcast and buy the products, you will continue to aid us together.
[02:29:34.344 --> 02:29:35.585]  In our victory against these tyrants.
[02:29:35.865 --> 02:29:37.445]  But now is the time to make the decision.
[02:29:37.986 --> 02:29:40.767]  I know there's millions of forms of media out there and all this BS.
[02:29:40.987 --> 02:29:42.767]  And the globalists hope you get lost in all of it.
[02:29:43.148 --> 02:29:47.789]  But notice the globalists, the New World Order, are coming after us because they realize we've got their number.
[02:29:48.670 --> 02:29:49.130]  Think about it.
[02:29:49.490 --> 02:29:50.791]  InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[02:29:50.811 --> 02:29:54.292]  If you want to support the tip of the spear, that decision is up to you.
[02:29:54.572 --> 02:29:56.133]  Please support us now at InfoWars.org.
[02:29:58.482 --> 02:30:01.583]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:30:01.603 --> 02:30:03.123]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:30:03.904 --> 02:30:06.945]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:30:07.825 --> 02:30:15.887]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:30:15.907 --> 02:30:24.550]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:30:25.569 --> 02:30:28.431]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:30:28.451 --> 02:30:34.215]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:30:35.016 --> 02:30:37.998]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[02:30:38.038 --> 02:30:46.284]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[02:30:46.964 --> 02:30:50.646]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsaw.com.
[02:30:51.267 --> 02:30:55.890]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsaw.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:30:56.230 --> 02:30:57.050]  Please take action now.
[02:30:57.791 --> 02:30:58.571]  Winter is coming.
[02:30:59.232 --> 02:30:59.972]  Winter is coming.
[02:31:00.192 --> 02:31:01.273]  Winter is coming.
[02:31:01.673 --> 02:31:02.434]  Winter is coming.
[02:31:02.734 --> 02:31:03.815]  Winter is coming!
[02:31:04.850 --> 02:31:06.330]  Winter is coming.
[02:31:06.671 --> 02:31:08.051]  Winter isn't coming.
[02:31:08.631 --> 02:31:09.932]  Winter is here.
[02:31:10.332 --> 02:31:17.834]  And while the sun isn't helping us produce as much vitamin D, do yourself a favor and try InfoWars Life Winter Sun Plus.

[02:32:06.045 --> 02:32:08.267]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[02:32:08.507 --> 02:32:09.227]  Hey, what's better?
[02:32:09.327 --> 02:32:09.828]  Knockout.
[02:32:10.188 --> 02:32:10.768]  What's better?
[02:32:11.529 --> 02:32:11.989]  Down and out.
[02:32:12.269 --> 02:32:12.730]  What's better?
[02:32:12.790 --> 02:32:14.391]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[02:32:15.071 --> 02:32:19.995]  And the answer is, different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[02:32:20.675 --> 02:32:24.278]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[02:32:24.659 --> 02:32:25.960]  That's how our bodies work.
[02:32:25.980 --> 02:32:26.901]  They're all very diverse.
[02:32:27.281 --> 02:32:37.490]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night's Sleep.

[02:32:59.683 --> 02:33:05.567]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:21.314 --> 02:33:25.997]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:33:26.157 --> 02:33:27.699]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:28.339 --> 02:33:30.320]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[02:33:30.641 --> 02:33:35.044]  Broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[02:33:37.322 --> 02:33:40.726]  Expert on chemtrails and geoengineering, Dave Whittington.
[02:33:41.066 --> 02:33:43.909]  The Norea Z hosts the fourth hour ahead of Owen Schroer.
[02:33:43.929 --> 02:33:46.311]  And the incredible guest, Dr. Kirk Elliott, we have.
[02:33:46.331 --> 02:33:48.073]  We'll be back on with Owen at 3 p.m.
[02:33:48.433 --> 02:33:48.853]  today.
[02:33:50.834 --> 02:33:53.175]  And look, what I said earlier, I don't have anything financial.
[02:33:53.195 --> 02:33:54.336]  It means nothing to me.
[02:33:54.936 --> 02:33:55.837]  God is providing.
[02:33:55.897 --> 02:34:00.499]  We are more influential and changing the world, and it's just magic, and I'm so blessed.
[02:34:00.859 --> 02:34:06.942]  And God has stripped everything away from me, not that everything really mattered to me, just to show me every day it's God.
[02:34:07.443 --> 02:34:12.965]  Like I'm going across lava, and God puts the next step in front of me to step across the lava or step through the fire.
[02:34:12.985 --> 02:34:14.626]  It is such a blessing.
[02:34:15.147 --> 02:34:17.688]  You know, I did international Russian TV.
[02:34:17.708 --> 02:34:19.549]  It's on all over the world, tens of millions of viewers.
[02:34:20.109 --> 02:34:23.232]  And I just laid out like a 23-minute breakdown of what's happening in the world.
[02:34:23.612 --> 02:34:26.295]  And folks thought I was cogent, I was calm, I was focused.
[02:34:26.335 --> 02:34:27.336]  I think it's informative.
[02:34:28.017 --> 02:34:28.477]  Here it is.
[02:34:28.537 --> 02:34:30.439]  I put it out on X as a post.
[02:34:30.859 --> 02:34:31.880]  I hope that you'll share it.
[02:34:32.261 --> 02:34:33.462]  And then so much more today.
[02:34:33.482 --> 02:34:35.143]  I'm gonna shoot some special reports as well.
[02:34:35.564 --> 02:34:36.725]  So please stay with us.
[02:34:37.105 --> 02:34:40.006]  And remember, InfoWars.com forward slash show is the link to share.
[02:34:40.386 --> 02:34:43.887]  And remember, great products at InfoWars.com that fund the operation.
[02:34:43.927 --> 02:34:49.449]  Got some big specials running right now on DNA Force Plus and Real Red Pill for 50% off.
[02:34:49.509 --> 02:34:50.609]  You've got to try these products.
[02:34:50.629 --> 02:34:51.129]  They're amazing.
[02:34:51.489 --> 02:34:52.570]  Thanks for keeping us on air.
[02:34:52.850 --> 02:34:53.650]  Thanks for your prayers.
[02:34:53.950 --> 02:34:55.090]  Here is the breakdown.
[02:35:02.711 --> 02:35:03.671]  Alex Jones.
[02:35:03.832 --> 02:35:06.634]  Alex, I'm really happy to have you join me right now.
[02:35:07.295 --> 02:35:17.906]  Just ahead of the forum, a Ukrainian delegation pushed for its own version of a peace plan at a meeting in Davos, but there appears to have been no tangible result.
[02:35:18.186 --> 02:35:19.908]  But why would that be?
[02:35:19.928 --> 02:35:22.070]  What could be the goal of that meeting?
[02:35:23.959 --> 02:35:26.001]  Well, it really tells you who's running the show.
[02:35:26.041 --> 02:35:37.090]  The Davos Group is the mouthpiece of these mega-corporations that are basically playing nation-states off against each other and using international crises to consolidate power.
[02:35:37.130 --> 02:35:43.655]  The same people that cooked up COVID-19 and released it, that caused worldwide lockdowns and then rolled out the experimental shots.
[02:35:44.135 --> 02:35:44.916]  So, Davos
[02:35:45.859 --> 02:35:45.999]  Yes.
[02:36:00.899 --> 02:36:01.219]  We're good.
[02:36:21.147 --> 02:36:35.392]  Now, do you expect any of Zelensky's counterparts in the EU to bring up the case of American journalist Gonzalo Lira, who was critical of the Ukrainian government and was jailed by Kiev for that, and was recently found dead in a Ukrainian prison cell?
[02:36:37.312 --> 02:36:37.992]  No, I don't.
[02:36:38.913 --> 02:36:41.334]  We know he went to the State Department and asked them to help him get out.
[02:36:41.374 --> 02:36:42.374]  He said he'd be a dead man.
[02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:44.141]  I don't
[02:36:59.917 --> 02:37:06.122]  They want to pretend like America is run by all these loving, wonderful, liberal people, but it's not.
[02:37:06.883 --> 02:37:08.484]  America isn't run by Americans.
[02:37:08.544 --> 02:37:10.445]  It's run by BlackRock.
[02:37:10.505 --> 02:37:20.513]  It's run by big central banks that basically use America, hijacked America, to project our power into the world and basically terrorize other nations into submission.
[02:37:20.573 --> 02:37:27.238]  So as an American patriot, my goal is to get control of our government back, and that's why I'm trying to support President Trump.
[02:37:27.924 --> 02:37:36.379]  Who clearly had the election stolen from him three years ago back into power so we can bring the world back from the edge of thermonuclear war.
[02:37:36.460 --> 02:37:39.705]  So my main mission is being loyal to God.
[02:37:40.470 --> 02:37:41.431]  Family and country.
[02:37:41.791 --> 02:37:49.717]  And because I'm loyal to America and our Republic, I don't want us to be in illegal wars with Russia or China or anybody else.
[02:37:49.777 --> 02:38:03.107]  But Gonzalo Lira was an amazing journalist, had a lot of courage, was very articulate, very well spoken, and really hit the nail on the head about Soros and the State Department nine years ago staging the coup in Kiev.
[02:38:03.687 --> 02:38:19.521]  And then all of the militarization by NATO in a covert proxy war or hybrid war against Russia to either test Russia and push up to Russia's border or try to entice Russia to respond to the invasion.
[02:38:20.282 --> 02:38:34.059]  But now we know that NATO is shocked almost two years in that despite their 200 million dollars and all of the advisors and troops there, that despite a heavy loss, Russia has now decisively won the war.
[02:38:34.159 --> 02:38:38.284]  So I would hope, even the late Henry Kissinger hoped this, that
[02:38:39.099 --> 02:38:46.061]  We could now have a peace deal and demilitarize Ukraine and move forward into the future.
[02:38:46.882 --> 02:38:47.142]  All right.
[02:38:47.182 --> 02:38:52.964]  Everyone's looking forward to that future that is certainly beneficial to everyone.
[02:38:53.424 --> 02:38:54.484]  You talked about Trump.
[02:38:54.504 --> 02:38:56.365]  We'll come to that soon.
[02:38:56.845 --> 02:39:02.507]  The World Economic Forum is expected to focus not only on Ukraine, but also on the war in Gaza.
[02:39:02.707 --> 02:39:08.209]  Do you think the conference will be able to come up with any kind of solution to either of those conflicts?
[02:39:08.709 --> 02:39:09.310]  Decisively.
[02:39:23.220 --> 02:39:33.429]  And Benjamin Netanyahu has said he wants to take all of Gaza and the trillions of dollars of oil and gas that are there and in the ocean in his territorial waters.
[02:39:33.469 --> 02:39:37.132]  So I'm not anti-Israel, but I'm also pro-truth.
[02:39:37.912 --> 02:39:40.475]  And so we know there was an Israeli stand down on October 7.
[02:39:41.255 --> 02:39:42.917]  We know they allowed the attack to happen.
[02:39:43.537 --> 02:39:50.283]  And it's now being used as a pretext to not just punish Hezbollah, but to also go after the people of Gaza.
[02:39:51.269 --> 02:39:56.332]  And so that's why I want a real ceasefire and a real peace deal, but I don't expect that.
[02:39:56.352 --> 02:40:03.396]  I think Netanyahu is just buying time while they ethically cleanse the Palestinians and push them into the sea.
[02:40:03.836 --> 02:40:05.857]  So I don't want to push the Jews into the sea.
[02:40:05.877 --> 02:40:08.139]  I don't want to push the Palestinians into the sea.
[02:40:08.159 --> 02:40:14.402]  I don't agree with Hamas's slogan, from the mountains to the sea, there'll be no more Israel.
[02:40:14.442 --> 02:40:18.605]  But I also don't agree with the Israeli statements that there'll be no more Palestinian state.
[02:40:19.085 --> 02:40:28.017]  The Arabs have been there as long as the Jews, and I do want to try to push for some type of two-state solution to finally bring peace to that war-torn region.
[02:40:28.558 --> 02:40:34.907]  And I know that's also been what a lot of other statesmen around the world have been supporting, so that's really my goal.
[02:40:36.148 --> 02:40:38.710]  In fact, that is what everyone around the world is saying.
[02:40:38.730 --> 02:40:42.913]  A two-state solution to all of this so it can be, you know, cost and peace.
[02:40:43.033 --> 02:40:54.102]  Now, another issue on the agenda is a panel dedicated to the so-called Disease X, a hypothetical pathogen that may cause a new pandemic many times more deadly than COVID.
[02:40:54.582 --> 02:40:56.724]  What do you expect to come out of those talks?
[02:40:58.165 --> 02:40:59.846]  Well, we know what Disease X is.
[02:41:00.767 --> 02:41:03.429]  The governments from Russia to China to the US to France
[02:41:04.808 --> 02:41:07.731]  The Japanese, they all know what diseases are here.
[02:41:08.131 --> 02:41:13.595]  You have new mutations of diseases, but there's no disease X. There's a new mutation of an already existing disease.
[02:41:13.615 --> 02:41:30.409]  So disease X is a holding place or a catch-all for gain-of-function bioweapons where they genetically splice viruses and also mutate viruses with radiation and other techniques to make them more communicable and more deadly.
[02:41:30.988 --> 02:41:50.741]  And so we have the UN that wants a worldwide treaty to take control of nation states and borders and transportation and trade with their UN pandemic treaty, really trying to establish a corporate world government, the name of it, hyping up disease X and saying it's going to kill 50 million people and it's imminent.
[02:41:51.142 --> 02:41:55.945]  Well, how can they be developing a vaccine for a disease that doesn't exist yet?
[02:41:55.965 --> 02:42:00.828]  And we know in China, in the United States, in Ukraine, all over the world,
[02:42:00.828 --> 02:42:12.499]  Well, Western governments have been caught producing weaponized biological weapons in these labs, not for defensive purposes, but for offensive purposes.
[02:42:13.139 --> 02:42:15.582]  Top scientists have reported it would take a billion years
[02:42:16.437 --> 02:42:21.902]  For the in perfect conditions for the COVID-19 to occur naturally.
[02:42:22.362 --> 02:42:26.245]  Five different viruses from around the world spliced together.
[02:42:26.565 --> 02:42:27.886]  It's basically impossible.
[02:42:28.287 --> 02:42:33.451]  And so we have is illegal gain of function going on around the world.
[02:42:33.971 --> 02:42:34.552]  In 2015 was a big scandal.
[02:42:36.587 --> 02:42:42.810]  When Obama was caught allowing gain of function at the University of Texas-Galveston and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
[02:42:43.070 --> 02:42:50.073]  So they then moved it to Wuhan, so when they released it, they could then have probable, plausible deniability about who'd made it.
[02:42:51.764 --> 02:43:03.874]  Now, the Russian authorities have speculated that the focus on hypothetical disease X could actually be an attempt for luring further investment into the healthcare sector.
[02:43:04.515 --> 02:43:06.617]  What do you think about those claims?
[02:43:06.977 --> 02:43:09.199]  You talked about it, can you elaborate more on that?
[02:43:10.960 --> 02:43:18.787]  Well, look, whether you're Russian or whether you're Norwegian or whether you're French or whether you're Mexican,
[02:43:20.293 --> 02:43:25.888]  These bioweapon labs set up and expanded under George W. Bush
[02:43:26.894 --> 02:43:30.097]  More than 15 years ago, are the real threat.
[02:43:30.857 --> 02:43:39.605]  So I oppose these bioweapon labs, not because I'm a Russian agent or not because I'm a South African agent, but because I'm an American that loves my family.
[02:43:39.945 --> 02:43:51.835]  And I know that the head of the Russian Ministry over Chemical and Biological Weapons came out a few months ago, did an excellent presentation showing that the West is preparing a new pathogen to release it.
[02:43:52.495 --> 02:43:53.316]  And that's just true.
[02:43:54.036 --> 02:44:00.740]  So when somebody's telling the truth, I will agree with them because I align myself with the truth.
[02:44:00.900 --> 02:44:13.787]  And if the Russians were openly developing antifunction biological weapons and building laboratories in Mexico, I would call for the US to invade and stop those laboratories as Russia did in Ukraine.
[02:44:14.367 --> 02:44:16.368]  Because I care about soul preservation and life.
[02:44:16.968 --> 02:44:19.590]  And so the reason the criminals that run my government
[02:44:19.990 --> 02:44:21.271]  We're good to go.
[02:44:34.339 --> 02:44:34.739]  I think
[02:44:53.025 --> 02:45:13.306]  Before he did, because I was interviewing all the experts and all the insiders and watching the Davos group, the mouthpiece of BlackRock and the Bilderberg group and the New World Order, I mean really the real James Bond villains that that's all based on, literally specters, what you should probably call it, they are salivating saying they're going to use a virus
[02:45:13.886 --> 02:45:17.228]  For global domination and to bring down the nation-state.
[02:45:17.288 --> 02:45:20.270]  So I had family die from the COVID they released.
[02:45:20.790 --> 02:45:23.211]  And I've had friends die from the shots.
[02:45:23.231 --> 02:45:25.352]  17 million are dead according to insurance company actuaries.
[02:45:25.712 --> 02:45:30.335]  And so I am literally being bombarded by this occupational force here in America.
[02:45:31.087 --> 02:45:32.869]  I'm peacefully trying to get Trump elected.
[02:45:33.249 --> 02:45:34.650]  I'm trying to get governors elected.
[02:45:35.090 --> 02:45:41.575]  I'm trying to get the crazy people from control of these hijackers that have hijacked this country.
[02:45:42.176 --> 02:45:48.801]  And so I want the world to know, not just Russians, that the American people are absolutely against this.
[02:45:48.821 --> 02:45:50.342]  You know, I would get attacked some.
[02:45:50.602 --> 02:45:53.645]  I was still mainly popular on the street, but I would get some attacks.
[02:45:54.591 --> 02:45:57.052]  Three, four years ago for supporting Trump.
[02:45:57.552 --> 02:45:59.333]  I go to the grocery store by myself.
[02:45:59.413 --> 02:46:00.413]  I go to the shopping mall.
[02:46:00.473 --> 02:46:01.074]  I go to church.
[02:46:01.554 --> 02:46:02.774]  I walk my dog down the street.
[02:46:03.214 --> 02:46:05.816]  All I get is love now from everybody.
[02:46:05.956 --> 02:46:11.438]  So I'm telling the world the globalists are way weaker than you think because I'm well known.
[02:46:11.478 --> 02:46:13.218]  The average person isn't well known, which is great.
[02:46:13.238 --> 02:46:14.339]  They have their privacy.
[02:46:14.599 --> 02:46:15.820]  But I am well known.
[02:46:16.140 --> 02:46:21.742]  And I'm telling you, I'm getting zero pushback, zero anger in America.
[02:46:22.362 --> 02:46:24.945]  All I get is, we appreciate you, keep what you're doing.
[02:46:24.985 --> 02:46:28.208]  So I want the world to know, the American people want peace.
[02:46:28.909 --> 02:46:30.190]  We do not want World War III.
[02:46:30.230 --> 02:46:31.191]  We do not want nuclear war.
[02:46:31.631 --> 02:46:33.813]  We want our country to be under our control.
[02:46:34.194 --> 02:46:35.855]  We want your country to be under your control.
[02:46:36.296 --> 02:46:37.977]  We have so many resources together.
[02:46:38.277 --> 02:46:39.539]  We want to go to space together.
[02:46:39.959 --> 02:46:41.460]  We want to work with each other.
[02:46:42.021 --> 02:46:43.983]  And like Trump went to North Korea to make a deal.
[02:46:44.383 --> 02:46:45.664]  And you know, everything else.
[02:46:45.805 --> 02:46:47.086]  We want progress.
[02:46:47.896 --> 02:46:49.276]  We want a future.
[02:46:49.917 --> 02:46:55.298]  But the military-industrial complex that President Eisenhower warned of, being the number one threat, does not want that.
[02:46:55.358 --> 02:46:57.658]  They want global domination.
[02:46:57.718 --> 02:47:00.179]  And the bigger problem is, they're incompetent.
[02:47:00.659 --> 02:47:04.160]  They inherited all their power from their predecessors that were more competent.
[02:47:04.420 --> 02:47:07.861]  Lloyd Austin, the Defense Secretary, has been missing for three, four weeks.
[02:47:08.221 --> 02:47:09.661]  He lied about where he was.
[02:47:10.341 --> 02:47:12.402]  Reportedly, he may even be near death right now.
[02:47:13.022 --> 02:47:16.403]  I looked at the number three people, the second, third and fourth in command.
[02:47:16.903 --> 02:47:18.064]  None of them are military.
[02:47:18.324 --> 02:47:21.065]  They're liberal political scientists.
[02:47:21.545 --> 02:47:22.825]  They're not engineers.
[02:47:23.205 --> 02:47:24.226]  They're not veterans.
[02:47:24.586 --> 02:47:25.906]  That is so dangerous.
[02:47:26.546 --> 02:47:28.407]  When we have people in command of the U.S.
[02:47:28.467 --> 02:47:34.189]  military and then the Hollywood scum out there promoting
[02:47:35.126 --> 02:47:39.530]  Like Sean Penn a year ago said, nuclear war is survivable.
[02:47:39.970 --> 02:47:41.852]  We need nuclear war on the table.
[02:47:42.252 --> 02:47:43.313]  We need nuclear war.
[02:47:43.613 --> 02:47:45.875]  He is an incompetent scumbag.
[02:47:46.596 --> 02:47:51.960]  And it's the same thing that Lloyd Austin at least was in the military and at least was in combat.
[02:47:52.281 --> 02:47:57.065]  He is in some hospital being eaten alive by bacteria right now, reportedly close to death.
[02:47:57.405 --> 02:48:01.968]  And the three people under him have never put on a uniform.
[02:48:02.429 --> 02:48:04.310]  They've never been an engineer.
[02:48:04.651 --> 02:48:06.032]  They've never fired a missile.
[02:48:06.312 --> 02:48:07.493]  They've never pulled a trigger.
[02:48:07.793 --> 02:48:10.655]  They've never fought somebody in a ditch.
[02:48:10.936 --> 02:48:12.417]  They don't know what war looks like.
[02:48:12.717 --> 02:48:14.038]  And that's why they're so dangerous.
[02:48:14.078 --> 02:48:16.100]  So we are all in grave danger.
[02:48:16.795 --> 02:48:21.979]  And we have to win the information war against the globalists to stop nuclear war for all our children.
[02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:23.180]  All right.
[02:48:23.220 --> 02:48:25.762]  Now, let's talk about Trump a little bit.
[02:48:25.802 --> 02:48:30.345]  Now, the World Economic Forum is happening just as the Republican primaries are beginning.
[02:48:30.365 --> 02:48:34.449]  Donald Trump has been a leader in pre-election polls.
[02:48:34.969 --> 02:48:38.972]  Could he be a topic of discussion at the conference in Davos?
[02:48:39.072 --> 02:48:39.953]  Let's hit it now.
[02:48:41.594 --> 02:48:46.458]  Actually, Davos said, and they're high priest, you all know Harari, I have the article right here,
[02:48:47.607 --> 02:48:56.991]  He said a victory by Trump will deal a death blow to the global order of the Anglo-American establishment.
[02:48:57.611 --> 02:49:00.973]  And again, for new viewers, Putin gets it right when he calls it the Anglo-American establishment.
[02:49:00.993 --> 02:49:01.753]  That's what they call themselves.
[02:49:02.053 --> 02:49:03.154]  It doesn't mean white people.
[02:49:03.574 --> 02:49:11.977]  It means the axis of the old British Empire with the United States Empire that is at war with basically humanity and our own people.
[02:49:12.537 --> 02:49:16.319]  And so they say the number one mission stopping Trump
[02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:24.762]  The number two mission is censoring the American people, and the number three mission is hyping up the ZZX to give them total power and control.
[02:49:25.182 --> 02:49:34.025]  So again, you have this literal James Bond villain, Paul Schwab, up there lecturing everybody about this world government.
[02:49:34.065 --> 02:49:34.885]  But here's the good news.
[02:49:35.345 --> 02:49:39.126]  You go to X, formerly Twitter, or you go to Instagram, anywhere,
[02:49:39.918 --> 02:49:43.299]  There'll be a Bill Gates or Klaus Schwab video with 10 million views.
[02:49:43.639 --> 02:49:46.399]  There'll be 20,000 comments, and I've looked at them.
[02:49:47.080 --> 02:49:53.701]  There might be one positive comment about the WEF or Bill Gates or Klaus Schwab in a thousand, literally.
[02:49:54.141 --> 02:49:56.962]  So I'm telling you, there's a complete collapse in them.
[02:49:57.562 --> 02:49:59.422]  They have nothing, but that's the problem.
[02:49:59.823 --> 02:50:01.403]  They don't have the people's brains.
[02:50:02.043 --> 02:50:05.745]  But they have the nuclear weapons and they are psychotic.
[02:50:06.585 --> 02:50:08.266]  And so, yes, they totally fear Trump.
[02:50:08.486 --> 02:50:09.627]  Trump's a strong president.
[02:50:09.907 --> 02:50:10.847]  He's pro-America.
[02:50:11.247 --> 02:50:12.668]  But he also wants to be friends.
[02:50:13.348 --> 02:50:18.711]  So if people deal with America straight, he wants giant business deals with the whole world.
[02:50:19.051 --> 02:50:20.312]  He wants fair exchange.
[02:50:20.732 --> 02:50:22.993]  He wants the middlemen, the oligarchs, to be removed.
[02:50:23.753 --> 02:50:26.854]  Uh, and that's why they're, they're, they're coming after him.
[02:50:26.894 --> 02:50:38.298]  So with 10 months to the election, most important election, I think in world history, uh, it's, it's, it's such a dangerous time because again, the Pentagon is run by the Democrats and that's the big news.
[02:50:38.338 --> 02:50:40.659]  They say Trump's going to be a dictator of elected.
[02:50:41.259 --> 02:50:48.642]  So they're introducing legislation this week, Senator Blumenthal to strip power from
[02:50:49.662 --> 02:51:00.571]  President Trump, who has the executive war power, to the Senate, show that he can't stop riots by Black Lives Matter, funded by George Soros, if he's elected.
[02:51:00.831 --> 02:51:08.178]  So they're openly planning, if Trump does get elected, which he's about to have a landslide, 50% of the vote in Iowa against
[02:51:09.318 --> 02:51:11.320]  Three other candidates, four other candidates.
[02:51:11.960 --> 02:51:14.582]  So no one's ever won Iowa with more than 12%.
[02:51:14.702 --> 02:51:16.964]  Okay, Ronald Reagan lost it.
[02:51:17.585 --> 02:51:24.611]  Trump is about to win, they think, with 55% of the vote, a giant landslide.
[02:51:24.951 --> 02:51:27.333]  So they know he's set to win in the general election.
[02:51:27.653 --> 02:51:28.794]  So will they assassinate him?
[02:51:29.054 --> 02:51:29.975]  Will they launch a war?
[02:51:30.275 --> 02:51:31.536]  Will they launch a cyber attack?
[02:51:31.797 --> 02:51:32.978]  Will they plunge the economy?
[02:51:33.778 --> 02:51:34.439]  That's the question.
[02:51:34.459 --> 02:51:37.942]  But now they're saying, we have to have a coup
[02:51:38.795 --> 02:51:43.344]  To take control of the military in the Congress, never done in U.S.
[02:51:43.364 --> 02:51:43.685]  history.
[02:51:44.457 --> 02:51:49.001]  Totally illegal, because Trump might use the military on them.
[02:51:49.441 --> 02:51:50.602]  He's never called for that.
[02:51:50.983 --> 02:51:52.004]  He's never done that.
[02:51:52.364 --> 02:51:54.246]  He's never persecuted his political rivals.
[02:51:54.546 --> 02:51:55.787]  He's all about soft power.
[02:51:56.067 --> 02:51:57.689]  He's all about results and economics.
[02:51:58.229 --> 02:51:59.530]  He wants economics, not war.
[02:51:59.851 --> 02:52:01.132]  He does think war's stupid.
[02:52:01.692 --> 02:52:03.614]  He does think it's stupid to have a war for no reason.
[02:52:04.234 --> 02:52:08.458]  And they say, oh, he's anti-military because he doesn't like seeing troops' legs blown off.
[02:52:08.538 --> 02:52:10.120]  No, not unless he has to.
[02:52:10.960 --> 02:52:14.081]  And so Trump is all about prosperity and they're in full panic mode.
[02:52:14.101 --> 02:52:21.063]  And so they're now saying, Washington Post, New York Times, Newsweek, Trump is going to be a dictator.
[02:52:21.503 --> 02:52:27.524]  So we have to remove the military power from him congressionally before he's elected.
[02:52:27.884 --> 02:52:29.224]  So he won't stop riots.
[02:52:29.925 --> 02:52:34.426]  They're planning a civil war uprising if Trump gets elected.
[02:52:34.486 --> 02:52:36.346]  So these people aren't backing down.
[02:52:36.406 --> 02:52:39.427]  The good news is six years ago.
[02:52:40.387 --> 02:52:42.611]  Seven, eight years ago, the average person didn't know this.
[02:52:42.671 --> 02:52:45.275]  I would tell Trump, Hey, here's the stay behind network.
[02:52:45.656 --> 02:52:47.959]  Obama put these networks in, here's their names.
[02:52:48.460 --> 02:52:50.744]  And then they came after me for it, but Trump didn't understand it.
[02:52:50.844 --> 02:52:52.186]  Now he knows.
[02:52:53.740 --> 02:52:55.060]  He understands who the people are.
[02:52:55.481 --> 02:53:00.442]  He'll be able to form a government that shuts this psychotic group down.
[02:53:01.242 --> 02:53:08.384]  And so we're hoping for a peaceful transition of power with the American people to reverse this.
[02:53:08.464 --> 02:53:19.527]  But the Democrats now believe he's going to win with such a landslide, and the deep state does, that they are literally saying they're going to take control of the military ahead of Trump getting in power.
[02:53:19.587 --> 02:53:21.728]  So this is a huge constitutional crisis.
[02:53:22.508 --> 02:53:28.913]  All right now, Trump and the incumbent US President Joe Biden have been accusing each other of being a dictator.
[02:53:29.093 --> 02:53:35.198]  Now how does that rhetoric affect the image of American democracy within a country and even abroad?
[02:53:37.702 --> 02:53:47.206]  Well, look, I've heard Putin say that it's good for Russia that they're persecuting Trump because it shows that the people running America don't have any place to lecture people.
[02:53:47.626 --> 02:53:51.228]  I don't care whether you're Russia or whether you're China or whether you're America.
[02:53:51.868 --> 02:53:54.889]  We should stand up against totalitarian aspects.
[02:53:55.309 --> 02:53:56.450]  And I know the numbers are real.
[02:53:56.470 --> 02:53:57.930]  I know Putin's very, very popular.
[02:53:58.411 --> 02:54:00.031]  He doesn't need to suppress things.
[02:54:00.772 --> 02:54:03.913]  But my point is, I have to disagree with Putin.
[02:54:04.628 --> 02:54:05.910]  And I've seen the shorter clip.
[02:54:05.950 --> 02:54:07.132]  He may have said more in context.
[02:54:07.572 --> 02:54:14.162]  I don't think of America persecuting a popular president they stole the election from and persecuting
[02:54:15.252 --> 02:54:22.039]  A president who's 20 points ahead of Joe Biden and who's about to get 55% of the vote against four other candidates in the primary.
[02:54:22.579 --> 02:54:30.347]  I don't see, I mean, I get it's good in one aspect, one level to say it shows that the people running America are bad.
[02:54:30.807 --> 02:54:31.908]  That statement's true by Putin.
[02:54:32.268 --> 02:54:34.631]  But if you look at second, third, fourth, fifth order,
[02:54:35.251 --> 02:54:39.154]  Was it good when Nazi Germany was run by Adolf Hitler just because it discredited Germany?
[02:54:39.434 --> 02:54:39.615]  No.
[02:54:40.015 --> 02:54:47.581]  The whole world is in danger because of this and those of us here in America are facing the fate of Gonzalo Lira.
[02:54:47.921 --> 02:54:52.985]  My own reporter just got out of prison where he was in solitary confinement for no reason.
[02:54:53.405 --> 02:54:54.766]  They're threatening me with jail.
[02:54:55.127 --> 02:54:57.809]  They've got groups trying... All I'm saying is
[02:54:58.766 --> 02:55:00.607]  If America goes down, look out.
[02:55:00.947 --> 02:55:03.468]  If Russia thinks they got a problem, right now.
[02:55:04.109 --> 02:55:07.970]  If the deep state's able to take out Trump and take us out, nobody's safe.
[02:55:08.430 --> 02:55:08.971]  We have...
[02:55:10.151 --> 02:55:16.874]  Something worse than Hitler running our government right now, because it's a bunch of bureaucrats and lawyers that pass the buck.
[02:55:17.474 --> 02:55:21.135]  They sit around these councils and all try to act powerful to each other.
[02:55:21.556 --> 02:55:23.076]  Almost none of them have ever been in a fight.
[02:55:23.436 --> 02:55:24.677]  Almost none of them are military.
[02:55:25.137 --> 02:55:26.738]  And so they just think war is cute.
[02:55:27.318 --> 02:55:34.421]  And they sit around and look, Biden said a year ago, we can't send tanks and F-16s to Russia.
[02:55:35.370 --> 02:55:38.472]  Or to Ukraine, because that's World War Three.
[02:55:38.993 --> 02:55:40.554]  And then six months later starts doing it.
[02:55:41.114 --> 02:55:46.838]  They are violating their own common sense, because they are incompetent.
[02:55:47.298 --> 02:55:51.081]  And so I'm telling everybody, don't fear the competence of America.
[02:55:52.062 --> 02:55:55.204]  You should fear the incompetence of the people that have hijacked it.
[02:55:55.524 --> 02:55:56.905]  We got plenty of competent people.
[02:55:57.509 --> 02:56:04.091]  But they don't want competent people in charge because they threaten their robbing and stealing and looting the Treasury.
[02:56:04.611 --> 02:56:13.414]  So that's my message to everybody here is that we have a very dangerous establishment in control here in America.
[02:56:14.234 --> 02:56:17.435]  All right, before I finally let you go, let me ask this question.
[02:56:17.835 --> 02:56:22.897]  What are your predictions or projection for this year, both in America and elsewhere in the world?
[02:56:24.710 --> 02:56:30.353]  Well, I appreciate the time here with you today, and I just love humanity, and I hope we can all live together and not kill each other.
[02:56:31.194 --> 02:56:42.400]  My predictions are an unprecedented year of economic turmoil, of expanded wars, and I think political assassinations, and I think a real change.
[02:56:42.440 --> 02:56:48.843]  But I can't make a pure prediction about what's going to happen because it's really up to all of us, the outcome of what unfolds.
[02:56:48.863 --> 02:56:49.564]  We should be praying,
[02:56:50.359 --> 02:56:51.419]  We should be politically active.
[02:56:52.140 --> 02:56:53.240]  We should be informing others.
[02:56:54.181 --> 02:56:56.021]  And we should be calling for sanity and peace.
[02:56:57.142 --> 02:57:04.165]  Because, you know, JFK and Khrushchev, you know, knew to talk to each other during the Cuban Missile Crisis, so we didn't have a nuclear war.
[02:57:04.665 --> 02:57:08.947]  And unfortunately, we don't have people like that in charge anymore over here.
[02:57:09.447 --> 02:57:13.428]  And so that's why we need President Trump in there to pull us back from the precipice.
[02:57:13.449 --> 02:57:16.690]  So, unprecedented year, and
[02:57:18.290 --> 02:57:19.671]  They're talking about a new pandemic.
[02:57:19.731 --> 02:57:20.551]  I hope they don't do it.
[02:57:20.571 --> 02:57:24.092]  I hope they don't release a new disease X. But the globalists are desperate.
[02:57:24.132 --> 02:57:25.493]  They're cornered rats.
[02:57:26.513 --> 02:57:29.134]  And that makes them extremely dangerous.
[02:57:29.775 --> 02:57:33.236]  And so I think the rhetoric we've seen out of Russia is good.
[02:57:33.696 --> 02:57:34.396]  We want peace.
[02:57:34.416 --> 02:57:35.357]  We don't want war.
[02:57:35.857 --> 02:57:36.577]  De-escalate.
[02:57:37.017 --> 02:57:42.420]  Unfortunately, NATO and Sweden are calling for war and all this craziness.
[02:57:43.080 --> 02:57:45.581]  But again, the average American does not want war.
[02:57:48.089 --> 02:57:52.311]  The Second American Revolution is happening now right in front of you.
[02:57:52.632 --> 02:57:56.994]  And you're tuned in to InfoWars because you're either looking for the truth or you're already a Patreon.
[02:57:57.454 --> 02:58:05.319]  I'm asking you now to realize we are at the fulcrum, the crossroads, in the fight for human destiny and human future.
[02:58:05.979 --> 02:58:07.721]  Please spread the word about the broadcast.
[02:58:08.161 --> 02:58:10.163]  Please buy great products at FortWorthStore.com.
[02:58:10.483 --> 02:58:13.406]  And please pray for the transmission.
[02:58:13.686 --> 02:58:14.867]  Without you, we're going to fail.
[02:58:15.308 --> 02:58:24.396]  But if you simply take action and spread the word and pray for the broadcast and buy the products, you will continue to aid us together.
[02:58:24.756 --> 02:58:25.977]  In our victory against these tyrants.
[02:58:26.257 --> 02:58:27.839]  But now is the time to make the decision.
[02:58:28.399 --> 02:58:31.182]  I know there's millions of forms of media out there and all this BS.
[02:58:31.402 --> 02:58:33.184]  And the globalists hope you get lost in all of it.
[02:58:33.544 --> 02:58:38.208]  But notice the globalists, the New World Order, are coming after us because they realize we've got their number.
[02:58:39.089 --> 02:58:39.549]  Think about it.
[02:58:39.910 --> 02:58:41.211]  InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[02:58:41.251 --> 02:58:43.133]  Do you want to support the tip of the spear?
[02:58:43.533 --> 02:58:44.694]  That decision is up to you.
[02:58:44.974 --> 02:58:46.556]  Please support us now at InfoWars.org.
[02:58:47.668 --> 02:58:49.268]  I'm not on Team NFL.
[02:58:49.569 --> 02:58:51.049]  I'm not on Team NBA.
[02:58:51.249 --> 02:58:52.229]  I'm not on Team Olympics.
[02:58:52.509 --> 02:58:55.930]  I'm not on Team Globalist, or wokeism in the New World Order.
[02:58:56.170 --> 02:59:06.413]  I'm on Team Humanity, ladies and gentlemen, that loves God and loves our families and loves humanity and knows that we're destined to do even more incredible things than we've already done together.
[02:59:06.573 --> 02:59:12.795]  And so, inspired by my conversation with Elon Musk recently, where he agreed with my idea to call it Team Humanity,
[02:59:13.095 --> 02:59:17.578]  We've launched two limited edition t-shirts at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:59:17.858 --> 02:59:21.821]  Let people know that, hey, it isn't about the football games, or it isn't even about the UFC.
[02:59:22.301 --> 02:59:26.364]  It's about Team Humanity being under globalist attack.
[02:59:26.664 --> 02:59:36.651]  You can wear it, it's a great conversation starter, and you know it's supporting the InfoWar that is at the very tip of the spear in the fight for Team Humanity.
[02:59:36.971 --> 02:59:41.634]  Get your limited edition Team Humanity t-shirts right now at InfoWarStore.com, and I thank you.
[02:59:49.319 --> 02:59:55.223]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:02.429 --> 03:00:04.330]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:04.450 --> 03:00:10.993]  I'm your guest host, Maria Zee of ZeeMedia.com, and I have a very, very important guest for you today.
[03:00:11.053 --> 03:00:15.896]  Weather warfare is something that I think needs a lot more attention.
[03:00:16.236 --> 03:00:23.079]  And now that InfoWars is streaming live to X as well, it's very important to get this guest on today.
[03:00:23.119 --> 03:00:25.941]  His name is Dane Wigington, geoengineeringwatch.org.
[03:00:27.182 --> 03:00:37.452]  has been researching geoengineering for a very, very long time and he's got updates for us today as to what they are doing in terms of weather warfare, including recently in Iowa.
[03:00:37.752 --> 03:00:39.474]  Dane, thank you so much for joining us today.
[03:00:39.514 --> 03:00:40.535]  We appreciate your time.
[03:00:40.555 --> 03:00:42.817]  Thank you, Maria.
[03:00:43.097 --> 03:00:48.483]  My gratitude to you and InfoWars for your continued attention towards what's happening in our skies.
[03:00:49.870 --> 03:00:50.350]  Absolutely.
[03:00:50.370 --> 03:00:51.731]  Well, it's hard to ignore it, Dane.
[03:00:52.231 --> 03:00:58.815]  Last time I spoke to you, I said to you there hasn't been a day that I can remember that I haven't seen the sky full of GT stripes.
[03:00:58.895 --> 03:01:02.057]  And recently, you know, in Australia, we're currently living through our summer.
[03:01:02.097 --> 03:01:03.457]  It's apparently global boiling.
[03:01:03.818 --> 03:01:06.279]  And yet it's pretty much freezing along the East Coast.
[03:01:06.939 --> 03:01:11.782]  You know, everyone knows Australia heating temperatures well over 40 degrees Celsius.
[03:01:12.642 --> 03:01:14.844]  And we've barely had that this year.
[03:01:14.884 --> 03:01:20.768]  So I'm keen to hear from you what they're doing in terms of weather warfare, not just in the United States, but everywhere.
[03:01:22.309 --> 03:01:31.837]  A key component of climate engineering that far too few are aware of or make account for is chemical ice nucleation for weather modification.
[03:01:31.877 --> 03:01:35.439]  It's cloud seeding with chemical ice nucleating elements, endothermic reacting elements.
[03:01:35.499 --> 03:01:37.761]  It's happening right now on a massive scale in the US.
[03:01:38.221 --> 03:01:40.403]  This is literally engineered winter weather warfare.
[03:01:41.044 --> 03:01:44.187]  And these elements are an energy-absorbing element.
[03:01:44.227 --> 03:01:46.369]  Again, an endothermic-reacting element.
[03:01:46.409 --> 03:01:49.071]  That's why you see these flash-free scenarios, Maria.
[03:01:49.392 --> 03:01:54.476]  We have, for example, the kind of freezing temperatures we see right now throughout parts of the U.S.
[03:01:54.516 --> 03:01:56.418]  that have been formerly far above
[03:01:57.196 --> 03:02:02.738]  Normal temperatures and are predicted to be far above normal temperatures again in a week.
[03:02:03.298 --> 03:02:19.943]  So when these flash freeze scenarios happen, people should wonder why this is occurring, why we have the climate engineering cover-up actors at the Weather Channel and other agencies like them trying to explain away why it's literally 30 degrees warmer, 5,000 feet up in the atmosphere.
[03:02:20.543 --> 03:02:21.243]  That's wrong.
[03:02:21.423 --> 03:02:22.364]  That's absolutely wrong.
[03:02:22.424 --> 03:02:26.765]  It's climate engineering creates a cold, dense layer of air that descends to the surface, Maria,
[03:02:27.886 --> 03:02:37.272]  And thus you get these ice storms that we have in the transition between the flows of moisture that in the US they're using to fuel these theatrically named winter storms.
[03:02:38.212 --> 03:02:46.357]  And you have an ice storm transition zone between the warmer flows of moisture and the frozen material by the time it hits the surface.
[03:02:46.377 --> 03:02:48.258]  So we see loads of traffic accidents.
[03:02:49.302 --> 03:02:58.124]  Again, the flash freeze scenarios that we see occurring, they target certain areas to pile up snow to make sensationalized headlines.
[03:02:58.865 --> 03:03:03.626]  But then we have the whiplash right back to the opposite extreme, and that's what we're facing now.
[03:03:03.666 --> 03:03:06.467]  But winter weather warfare, not speculation.
[03:03:06.527 --> 03:03:09.227]  Chinese government openly announced that they were engaged in this.
[03:03:09.868 --> 03:03:11.348]  All forms of major media covered it.
[03:03:11.388 --> 03:03:15.309]  The Guardian, CNN, MSNBC, Popular Science, Fox News.
[03:03:16.078 --> 03:03:17.939]  But yet, now, that map's important.
[03:03:17.999 --> 03:03:20.081]  That's the scheduled weather, literally.
[03:03:20.741 --> 03:03:24.644]  That's the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S.
[03:03:24.824 --> 03:03:36.832]  Agency of Weather Personnel that have a federal gag order on them, and that is literally the scheduled weather done by Raytheon and Lockheed Martin, private defense contractors that are neck-deep in climate engineering.
[03:03:36.892 --> 03:03:42.135]  So, Americans simply have no idea the degree to which their weather is being completely manipulated.
[03:03:44.995 --> 03:03:53.122]  Dane, you sent me a link and if the team's got it, geo-engineered winter weather, the chemical ice nucleation factor, if we don't bring it up now, we'll bring it up on the other side of the break.
[03:03:53.582 --> 03:04:04.251]  I was watching, there it is, I was watching mainstream media reports and hearing them say things like, oh wow, you've got to be so brave to go out in Iowa to vote.
[03:04:04.831 --> 03:04:07.432]  Look at these brave people going out into this weather.
[03:04:07.472 --> 03:04:15.414]  It's almost as though, I mean, I think it is definitely weather warfare being used to even interfere with things like elections.
[03:04:15.474 --> 03:04:31.898]  I think this is an, you know, an unseen weapon initially because people, so many people aren't aware of how it's happening and there's so many various ways in which they're doing it to, you know, even to the point of making people feel depressed because they barely see any sunlight.
[03:04:32.179 --> 03:04:33.839]  This is certainly the case in Australia.
[03:04:34.459 --> 03:04:48.083]  So we're going to go to break in a second and when we come back I want to talk to you about what happened in Iowa and I want to ask a few more questions about this flash freezing and what the United States can expect as well as people on other, you know, across every other country.
[03:04:48.143 --> 03:04:51.004]  Geoengineeringwatch.org is the website.
[03:04:51.064 --> 03:04:54.365]  Watch the dimming and we'll be back with Dane Wiggington after this short break.
[03:05:00.270 --> 03:05:01.670]  Last year we put this book out.
[03:05:02.511 --> 03:05:03.931]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[03:05:03.951 --> 03:05:05.731]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[03:05:06.312 --> 03:05:09.572]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[03:05:10.093 --> 03:05:10.993]  The Great Awakening.
[03:05:11.073 --> 03:05:14.914]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[03:05:15.334 --> 03:05:16.974]  This is such a powerful book.
[03:05:17.374 --> 03:05:19.075]  It covers all the globalist plans.
[03:05:19.735 --> 03:05:20.095]  Let's do it!
[03:05:38.891 --> 03:05:46.359]  This is next level information and it's a great way to not just support the broadcast, but inform yourself to the next level and share the book with friends and family.
[03:05:46.660 --> 03:05:53.027]  So whether you want one copy or multiple copies, go now to InfoWarsTore.com and get The Great Awakening.
[03:05:53.227 --> 03:05:54.428]  This is going to go to number one.
[03:05:54.448 --> 03:05:55.770]  I want to thank you for your support.

[03:06:15.820 --> 03:06:18.601]  We're here with Dane Bligington of geoengineeringwatch.org.
[03:06:19.021 --> 03:06:22.502]  And team, if you can do me a favor, can you just bring up the smoking gun?
[03:06:23.022 --> 03:06:27.684]  Everyone goes to zmedia.com and just search the term smoking gun on the interviews page.
[03:06:28.244 --> 03:06:32.391]  It's also up on Band.Video on the ZMedia tab, so it's up everywhere.
[03:06:32.791 --> 03:06:40.923]  This, Dane, is where I went to the NOAA, and I'm bringing this up because you just mentioned the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association.
[03:06:40.963 --> 03:06:43.127]  These guys, the NOAA,
[03:06:44.093 --> 03:06:44.653]  I don't think so.
[03:07:04.186 --> 03:07:07.527]  It's absolutely real and they publish it online.
[03:07:07.927 --> 03:07:19.609]  So please talk to us about what happened in Iowa and how people were actually essentially, I think, being discouraged from going to the Iowa caucus.
[03:07:21.490 --> 03:07:23.450]  Many agendas being carried out at once.
[03:07:23.850 --> 03:07:24.730]  I don't deny that.
[03:07:25.331 --> 03:07:26.871]  There are many layers to this scenario.
[03:07:28.940 --> 03:07:37.285]  The core agendas are far larger than the illusion of elections that we have some choice in what's happening with our government, which we don't.
[03:07:37.765 --> 03:07:44.889]  But I don't deny that those types of events are certainly some of the fringe benefits for those in power of what they're doing.
[03:07:44.969 --> 03:07:46.389]  I'm not denying that at all.
[03:07:46.409 --> 03:07:54.874]  I don't know if you have access to your email, Maria, I just sent you another map that would be very important to put up if you have a way to get that to your
[03:07:55.737 --> 03:08:06.492]  Producers there that would be very telling but I just said that to you right now in regard to The again the overall agendas they are certainly
[03:08:07.751 --> 03:08:09.592]  Decimating crop production, we know that.
[03:08:09.712 --> 03:08:16.097]  And as far as these elements go, I want to point out a couple things so that your listeners understand the magnitude of what they're doing, Maria.
[03:08:16.137 --> 03:08:25.603]  You've been in a market before, Maria, where you have the open freezer that has all the frozen material inside, and the whole top of the freezer is open, but that cold air sits in that basin.
[03:08:25.623 --> 03:08:26.824]  You've seen that before, correct?
[03:08:27.864 --> 03:08:28.044]  Yes.
[03:08:30.802 --> 03:08:32.163]  The same scenario happening now.
[03:08:32.203 --> 03:08:37.206]  When they chemically nucleate cloud moisture, a cold, dense layer of air descends to the surface.
[03:08:37.807 --> 03:08:39.548]  This tends to be a very penetrating cold.
[03:08:39.568 --> 03:08:41.689]  It's very, very low
[03:08:43.502 --> 03:08:52.811]  To the touch, the temperatures we've had with some of the frozen material that falls, Maria, can be 10, 15, 20 degrees colder than the ambient temperature of the air around it.
[03:08:53.011 --> 03:08:53.932]  How is that possible?
[03:08:54.052 --> 03:08:55.253]  Again, it's a chemical freeze.
[03:08:55.793 --> 03:08:59.777]  Same as you have a first aid kit on your shelf for 20 years at room temperature.
[03:08:59.817 --> 03:09:02.960]  You mix that cold pack chemical together, you have ice instantly.
[03:09:03.460 --> 03:09:04.521]  And that's the same principle.
[03:09:04.561 --> 03:09:06.602]  Again, it's called an endothermic reacting element.
[03:09:07.002 --> 03:09:14.407]  These are patented processes, and many are beginning to wake up to the fact that this winter weather warfare is a core part of climate engineering.
[03:09:14.447 --> 03:09:19.530]  It's not just covering the sky with light scattering particles, blocking our sunlight, eliminating our blue skies.
[03:09:19.991 --> 03:09:23.393]  They are absolutely engineering these radical temperature swings.
[03:09:23.993 --> 03:09:29.637]  And you also have elements in this frozen material, Maria, which comes in many different forms, and your listeners have probably noticed this.
[03:09:29.697 --> 03:09:31.298]  It's not just a snowflake like we
[03:09:32.290 --> 03:09:42.136]  We've experienced from decades past, we have cotton ball-like frozen material, some looks like grains of rice, or what's called grapple, looks like little styrofoam balls.
[03:09:42.736 --> 03:09:45.798]  All of these are different forms of chemical ice nucleated elements.
[03:09:46.659 --> 03:09:49.981]  But, and that, what you show right there, that's a very important picture.
[03:09:50.281 --> 03:09:53.923]  That's ice balls likely from Lake Michigan or the Baltic Sea.
[03:09:54.564 --> 03:09:56.985]  That is absolutely core to climate engineering.
[03:09:57.085 --> 03:09:57.826]  When you drop these
[03:09:59.227 --> 03:10:04.929]  Endothermic reacting elements on a body of water, it builds up around those elements and forms those ice balls.
[03:10:04.949 --> 03:10:07.770]  And how many people would think that that's normal or natural?
[03:10:07.790 --> 03:10:13.092]  They have coastlines and beaches and the Great Lakes, which by the way, are record warm right now.
[03:10:13.112 --> 03:10:14.252]  I don't know how many people know that.
[03:10:14.272 --> 03:10:15.893]  There's no ice on the Great Lakes.
[03:10:16.533 --> 03:10:19.834]  They're virtually the warmest they've ever been in recorded history.
[03:10:20.014 --> 03:10:21.154]  Nobody talks about that.
[03:10:21.174 --> 03:10:22.615]  They just look at the cold, cold, cold.
[03:10:23.835 --> 03:10:26.316]  So again, there's factors here we're not being told about.
[03:10:26.816 --> 03:10:43.441]  One key element I want to mention today, that there's, as we speak, legislation being voted on in New Hampshire to ban climate engineering operations, which carries in this legislation some significant, there you go, thank you, some significant
[03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:54.703]  Penalties if this were to pass, which is unlikely, but the fact that the legislatures did a very good job of drafting this using the science terms and descriptions.
[03:10:55.343 --> 03:10:56.104]  This is helpful.
[03:10:56.304 --> 03:11:06.347]  We hope people will circulate this draft to their legislatures in their states so that we can help bring awareness to this issue because the gravity of what they're doing in our skies cannot be overstated.
[03:11:06.952 --> 03:11:18.482]  This is not just weather warfare, it's also a form of biological warfare, at minimum, with the elements we know are falling, aluminum, barium, strontium, manganese, polymer fibers, surfactants, graphene.
[03:11:19.383 --> 03:11:27.810]  And two of those elements, polymer fibers and graphene, we know are used militarily as biological carrier agents, which means they can carry a pathogen from the clouds to the ground.
[03:11:28.511 --> 03:11:32.314]  So, there are so many levels of warfare going on in our skies, Maria.
[03:11:33.513 --> 03:11:46.477]  Well, the biological carrier agents that you're discussing, in terms of the nanoparticles that are in the trails that are in our skies, can literally be programmed at this point with anything.
[03:11:46.777 --> 03:11:54.700]  And so when you're talking about disease X, and I mentioned this with you on air before, Dane, and I keep bringing it up because it's so vital.
[03:11:55.220 --> 03:12:04.844]  Even when you look at Disease X and you look at the World Economic Forum, for example, posting about this, it's their climate and science department.
[03:12:05.885 --> 03:12:21.131]  When you look at Australia's pandemic preparedness report, you can see, and that's the CSIRO involved in that, who was suspected of participating in gain of function in China, they talk about how future pandemics are going to be caused by human encroachment on natural habitats,
[03:12:21.651 --> 03:12:24.132]  Which is basically you going to your local park.
[03:12:25.112 --> 03:12:34.455]  And also, because of climate change, pandemics will change as they see fit because of climate change.
[03:12:34.755 --> 03:12:45.059]  And so as they continue to geoengineer the weather, they're also dropping harmful biological agents into the skies and then blaming it on climate change.
[03:12:47.068 --> 03:12:48.049]  Blaming it on nature.
[03:12:48.289 --> 03:12:49.269]  They've always done so.
[03:12:49.309 --> 03:12:49.490]  Yes.
[03:12:49.790 --> 03:12:56.714]  And why would we believe that they're not doing this, conducting biological experiments every single day, when we know, as I've cited in the past, as of...
[03:12:57.384 --> 03:13:03.089]  As far back as 1977, according to the Washington Post, the U.S.
[03:13:03.129 --> 03:13:09.315]  military had already done no less than 239 open-air biological tests on innocent, unknowing U.S.
[03:13:09.335 --> 03:13:09.875]  civilians.
[03:13:10.276 --> 03:13:11.437]  This is business as usual.
[03:13:11.497 --> 03:13:12.818]  How many have they done since then?
[03:13:12.878 --> 03:13:13.799]  Why wouldn't they do this?
[03:13:13.859 --> 03:13:14.800]  Of course they're doing it.
[03:13:15.340 --> 03:13:19.584]  We have all of the global data stating that global populations need to be cut by about 90%.
[03:13:20.645 --> 03:13:22.467]  Do we think they're really here to help us?
[03:13:22.967 --> 03:13:23.588]  Of course not.
[03:13:24.068 --> 03:13:26.010]  And these elements are infiltrating everything.
[03:13:26.050 --> 03:13:28.992]  We know that now microplastics are in virtually everything.
[03:13:29.352 --> 03:13:32.655]  And that's part of the polymer fibers that are a part of the climate engineering mix.
[03:13:32.715 --> 03:13:35.617]  Everywhere from the North Pole, South Pole, top of Mount Everest.
[03:13:35.657 --> 03:13:37.959]  And yes, we have trash all over the world.
[03:13:38.019 --> 03:13:38.999]  Plastics decomposing.
[03:13:39.620 --> 03:13:46.025]  But this contamination is so ubiquitous with particles that appear to be manufactured when they're looked at through
[03:13:47.168 --> 03:13:48.529]  Examining equipment in labs.
[03:13:49.149 --> 03:13:52.850]  And so, again, we can't separate climate engineering from all of this.
[03:13:52.910 --> 03:14:06.015]  And now, according to recent studies by Consumer Reports, for example, they studied 85 staple foods, 84 of which, including organic, had a massive amount of microplastic nanoparticles in them.
[03:14:06.215 --> 03:14:10.977]  A bottle of water, this was just published a week ago, a bottle of supposedly pure drinking water, 250,000
[03:14:14.164 --> 03:14:19.669]  Particles, nanoparticles of microplastic, and what people imagine to be a clear bottle of drinking water.
[03:14:19.689 --> 03:14:23.932]  And these plastics infiltrate into our organs, across the blood-brain barrier.
[03:14:23.972 --> 03:14:25.593]  They're unimaginably small.
[03:14:25.613 --> 03:14:33.900]  For your listeners to understand how small a particle, a thousand nanoparticles can fit across the width of a single human hair.
[03:14:34.280 --> 03:14:36.702]  That's unimaginably small, and they're in everything now.
[03:14:36.802 --> 03:14:37.203]  So again,
[03:14:38.129 --> 03:14:41.831]  What's happening in our skies, just the elements alone are highly toxic.
[03:14:41.871 --> 03:14:51.315]  When you mix those elements, you have what's called synergistic toxicity, which in the case of mercury and aluminum, makes the total toxicity as much as 10,000% worse.
[03:14:51.355 --> 03:14:56.497]  That's a hundred times worse, and now we have the potential biologicals, which are certainly part of the mix, and
[03:14:57.037 --> 03:15:03.318]  You have fungal elements, Maria, which that's fungal infections from people to the flora and the fauna.
[03:15:03.838 --> 03:15:06.939]  Very insidious, very hard to detect, very hard to get rid of.
[03:15:06.959 --> 03:15:13.100]  And when you feel the atmosphere with these types of particles, they become fungal proliferation platforms.
[03:15:13.240 --> 03:15:17.701]  And when you're blocking the sun, which would otherwise sterilize many fungal ailments.
[03:15:17.861 --> 03:15:24.342]  Now we have an entire biosphere that's infected with fungal everything on top of all the rest I just described.
[03:15:26.317 --> 03:15:30.758]  They're literally just creating a toxic environment absolutely anywhere that you go.
[03:15:31.258 --> 03:15:51.703]  I'm aware of the pardon me the microplastics that they recently said that they were finding it actually that they were talking about the fact that they were discovering this even during surgeries this this buildup of microplastics so I want to talk to you more about you know who's doing this on the other side of the break and how we put a stop to it.
[03:15:51.983 --> 03:15:53.844]  Don't go anywhere we'll be right back with Dane Wiggins.
[03:15:57.665 --> 03:16:00.588]  Have you tried taking the Real Red Pill?
[03:16:00.768 --> 03:16:06.614]  A one-of-a-kind heart and brain formula designed exclusively for InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:16:06.814 --> 03:16:11.499]  One of the most powerful ingredients in the Real Red Pill Plus is pregnenolone.
[03:16:11.719 --> 03:16:19.647]  Pregnenolone levels decrease with age, and low levels are associated with fatigue, low brain function, and unhealthy aging.
[03:16:19.867 --> 03:16:27.832]  The Real Red Pill Plus also provides essential trace minerals such as vitamin B12, calcium, copper, and zinc.
[03:16:28.032 --> 03:16:40.980]  Featuring naturally occurring L-theanine, caffeine, and theobromine, the energy blend inside the Real Red Pill Plus provides an extra pick-me-up for your day that goes beyond the second cup of coffee.
[03:16:41.280 --> 03:16:48.173]  So visit infowarsstore.com, go down the rabbit hole, and try taking the real red pill.
[03:16:48.413 --> 03:16:52.982]  Now 25% off for a limited time at infowarsstore.com.
[03:16:57.216 --> 03:17:01.498]  29 years on air, all I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalists.
[03:17:02.219 --> 03:17:07.521]  And I've done the best job I can to tell the truth and be accurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[03:17:07.921 --> 03:17:14.364]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves, unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people.
[03:17:14.604 --> 03:17:15.284]  We don't do that.
[03:17:15.745 --> 03:17:17.645]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[03:17:18.006 --> 03:17:20.667]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product that's so powerful.
[03:17:21.588 --> 03:17:26.594]  This is the breakdown product, after your cells process it, of folic acid.
[03:17:27.155 --> 03:17:31.661]  Methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[03:17:32.101 --> 03:17:33.343]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[03:17:33.383 --> 03:17:34.224]  It's not a stimulant.
[03:17:34.484 --> 03:17:36.367]  It energizes your cells.
[03:17:36.867 --> 03:17:39.330]  And then everything else you take just supercharges it.
[03:17:39.410 --> 03:17:40.251]  It's so insane.
[03:17:40.592 --> 03:17:42.113]  It's foundational energy.
[03:17:42.554 --> 03:17:46.699]  The strongest formula out there at infowarstore.com.
[03:17:47.099 --> 03:17:51.144]  It doesn't just energize this operation against the tyrants, it energizes you.
[03:17:51.424 --> 03:17:52.826]  Get foundational energy now!
[03:17:56.701 --> 03:17:58.484]  Real death is shutting off the economy.
[03:17:58.684 --> 03:18:01.008]  The bureaucrats and the corporations control the economy.
[03:18:01.308 --> 03:18:04.814]  As they vertically integrate the economy and consolidate power, they murder people en masse.
[03:18:05.435 --> 03:18:08.580]  Elon Musk has warned them that if you destroy civilization,
[03:18:09.406 --> 03:18:14.290]  You won't be able to have certain redoubts of it in certain city-states that still have it, the Hunger Games model.
[03:18:14.610 --> 03:18:18.953]  It will destroy the elite as well, and anybody that studies history and has common sense knows that.
[03:18:19.633 --> 03:18:24.617]  The wars that are going to come out of the starvation and the inflation are being blamed on global warming.
[03:18:24.837 --> 03:18:27.539]  The viruses that come out of the labs are being blamed on global warming.
[03:18:27.779 --> 03:18:31.222]  The third world hordes being organized by the UN to invade are being blamed on global warming.
[03:18:32.043 --> 03:18:33.704]  The mass starvation is blamed on the virus.
[03:18:35.191 --> 03:18:37.399]  And everywhere we're told it's going to get worse.
[03:18:37.499 --> 03:18:38.463]  Billions are coming.
[03:18:38.623 --> 03:18:40.951]  Al Gore and Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton.
[03:18:41.857 --> 03:18:49.001]  And the Rothschilds and the Davos Group and Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and Yovaldo Harari say billions are coming to Europe.
[03:18:49.221 --> 03:18:50.701]  A billion are coming to the U.S.
[03:18:51.162 --> 03:18:52.442]  because of climate change.
[03:18:52.983 --> 03:18:57.425]  No, because you cut their economy off because the IMF and World Bank controls the loans and ordered lockdowns.
[03:18:58.085 --> 03:19:02.227]  You know, I stood up here and I yell and scream about the New World Order and the globalists.
[03:19:02.247 --> 03:19:06.349]  They're planning to get rid of the borders and release a virus and have a global power grab.
[03:19:06.389 --> 03:19:07.430]  And you saw it all come true.
[03:19:08.550 --> 03:19:09.291]  But there's a
[03:19:10.419 --> 03:19:11.200]  Inverse of that.
[03:19:11.940 --> 03:19:16.924]  There's not just the bad stuff I'm telling you about, there's the good stuff I'm telling you about.
[03:19:17.684 --> 03:19:22.328]  And just like our information is the best you're going to find out there, our supplements are amazing.
[03:19:22.988 --> 03:19:26.731]  So our new special in the last half of January 2024 is here.
[03:19:27.251 --> 03:19:31.594]  It's Real Red Pill Plus and DNA Force Plus, both 50% off.
[03:19:31.775 --> 03:19:34.837]  We're calling it the Supercharged Special.
[03:19:35.497 --> 03:19:40.762]  You can get either one of these great items at 40% off individually or together for 50% off.
[03:19:41.062 --> 03:19:45.546]  Now the time we have left, I can't tell you why they're so great and what they do for your body.
[03:19:45.946 --> 03:19:50.670]  Go to InfoWarstore.com, look at the ingredients and investigate it and then get them.
[03:19:50.971 --> 03:19:53.473]  It supports the InfoWar and it'll change your life.
[03:19:54.053 --> 03:19:54.854]  Take advantage now!
[03:19:55.014 --> 03:19:55.755]  InfoWarstore.com
[03:19:58.877 --> 03:20:04.818]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:13.641 --> 03:20:21.222]  You know, when I was in the United States last year at the Reawakened America Tour, I spoke to a couple there, really, really beautiful couple.
[03:20:21.783 --> 03:20:27.644]  And the female, I don't know whether she was a girlfriend or wife, said to me, oh, you know,
[03:20:28.759 --> 03:20:30.280]  He's fully on board about Opana.
[03:20:30.320 --> 03:20:34.182]  He's fully on board with everything, but he just doesn't believe that geoengineering is occurring.
[03:20:34.222 --> 03:20:36.062]  And I said, what is it?
[03:20:36.423 --> 03:20:37.863]  You don't see the stripes in the sky?
[03:20:37.883 --> 03:20:38.664]  You don't understand?
[03:20:39.004 --> 03:20:40.504]  He said, it's just so far-fetched.
[03:20:41.165 --> 03:20:42.245]  I love InfoWars.
[03:20:42.625 --> 03:20:43.526]  I watch it daily.
[03:20:43.706 --> 03:20:46.367]  I just can't grasp the geoengineering stuff.
[03:20:46.747 --> 03:20:47.848]  So I directed him to that
[03:20:49.188 --> 03:20:52.670]  A broadcast that I told everyone about before, the Chemtrails the Smoking Gun.
[03:20:52.690 --> 03:21:02.157]  And I said, watch this, because the NOAA literally has all of their completed projects of geoengineering on their website.
[03:21:02.177 --> 03:21:11.063]  They've even got a contract with Make Sunsets for all the earth, solar radiation management of all the earth, blocking out the sun.
[03:21:12.122 --> 03:21:13.203]  It's on their website.
[03:21:13.283 --> 03:21:14.864]  And Dane Wigginton's here with me today.
[03:21:14.884 --> 03:21:23.929]  And what I wanted to tell you, Dane, that when I did that investigation, what I found was so interesting because I thought, why are they uploading all of this online for the whole world to see?
[03:21:23.969 --> 03:21:24.909]  It's so strange.
[03:21:25.670 --> 03:21:28.011]  And I read through their Omics strategy.
[03:21:29.053 --> 03:21:29.553]  We're good to go.
[03:21:48.095 --> 03:21:52.218]  do geoengineering in order to mitigate climate change?
[03:21:52.738 --> 03:22:00.003]  You know, what's the potential that in 2025 the NOAA's AI is going to say we need to do more of this?
[03:22:02.785 --> 03:22:14.853]  If I can make a delineation between, and you're correct, all those publicized state regional weather modification programs, those are very different from climate engineering.
[03:22:15.033 --> 03:22:16.294]  They are real, you're 100% correct,
[03:22:17.751 --> 03:22:24.214]  They're ongoing, but they are completely negated by the exponentially larger climate intervention operations.
[03:22:24.254 --> 03:22:40.321]  So what those publicized programs are designed to do is to make people believe that the single-engine, propeller-driven aircraft with a few flares strapped to the wings is the full extent of these programs, which couldn't be further from the truth.
[03:22:40.361 --> 03:22:45.664]  So when you take one, quote, weather modification plane, like I just described, single-engine, propeller-driven airplane,
[03:22:46.384 --> 03:22:54.650]  Flares on the wings with silver iodide that might disperse 10 or 20 kilos at max in a payload.
[03:22:54.910 --> 03:23:01.075]  A KC-135, a military KC-135 can disperse a hundred tons in a single flight.
[03:23:01.675 --> 03:23:12.823]  So those local weather mod programs are designed to give the impression that these operations in our skies are smaller and more benign than the, again, extremely dire
[03:23:13.998 --> 03:23:30.224]  completely biosphere-altering programs that they are, and in the Make Sunsets group, two, I would argue, distraction clowns from Silicon Valley that tried to obscure the overall picture of climate engineering.
[03:23:30.244 --> 03:23:38.907]  This is useful to those in power in that it takes people's eyes off of what's actually happening, which is an intergovernmental cooperation, Maria, and that's very important to understand.
[03:23:38.927 --> 03:23:40.448]  Whatever the superficial
[03:23:41.088 --> 03:23:43.069]  Conflicts are China, Russia, U.S.
[03:23:43.249 --> 03:23:48.150]  They are absolutely all colluding and cooperating on the climate intervention operations.
[03:23:48.230 --> 03:23:49.551]  It cannot be otherwise.
[03:23:49.951 --> 03:23:51.491]  There has to be global cooperation.
[03:23:51.511 --> 03:23:52.011]  We have U.S.
[03:23:52.031 --> 03:24:01.134]  documents as much as 800 pages long posted at geoengineeringwatch.org that describe that intergovernmental cooperation, specifically stating
[03:24:01.832 --> 03:24:06.656]  That this supersedes other conflicts that they will work together on these issues.
[03:24:06.816 --> 03:24:10.458]  There's blanket immunity described for anyone and everyone involved with these programs.
[03:24:10.999 --> 03:24:14.882]  So the scope and scale of what's happening in our skies cannot be overstated.
[03:24:15.422 --> 03:24:19.205]  And back to the biological aspect, one more element that's worth mentioning.
[03:24:20.040 --> 03:24:20.800]  Are prions.
[03:24:21.500 --> 03:24:23.661]  And that's something many people don't know much about.
[03:24:23.801 --> 03:24:27.442]  And the prion is a very, very insidious pathogen.
[03:24:28.042 --> 03:24:30.562]  It's mad cow disease, Crutchfield-Jacobs in humans.
[03:24:30.682 --> 03:24:33.103]  It has a very long latency period.
[03:24:33.643 --> 03:24:45.385]  So if they are seeding something like a prion, it can sit dormant like a ticking time bomb for months, years, even decades before it takes hold.
[03:24:45.425 --> 03:24:47.926]  And you can't cook this out of your food, for example, if it's in
[03:24:48.644 --> 03:24:58.087]  If it's in a deer or other form of wildlife or in your livestock or your poultry or prions are very insidious for those listeners that don't know what those are.
[03:24:58.147 --> 03:24:59.228]  They should investigate that.
[03:24:59.248 --> 03:25:08.551]  And again, back to those in power, when they are openly stating on the record that 95% of the population needs to go, how can anyone possibly think that they're here to help?
[03:25:09.431 --> 03:25:13.753]  And one more comment about the person you spoke to that said they just couldn't accept climate engineering.
[03:25:14.514 --> 03:25:15.055]  It's happening.
[03:25:15.255 --> 03:25:24.762]  If a person can't assimilate what they can see with their own eyes, and we have film footage at GeoInjuryWatch.org up close, nozzles visible, these aircraft turning on and off.
[03:25:25.383 --> 03:25:28.345]  If a person doesn't accept that, there's not much else you can do.
[03:25:29.186 --> 03:25:33.409]  Time to move on to somebody else, but we have many in society that are in that exact category.
[03:25:34.833 --> 03:25:36.834]  Yes, I agree with you, Dane, and you're absolutely right.
[03:25:36.874 --> 03:25:38.875]  This is much bigger than the local projects.
[03:25:39.235 --> 03:25:44.257]  I just meant that if people were struggling to understand that this is happening, I mean, it's all up there.
[03:25:44.297 --> 03:25:51.360]  The NOAA admits it, you know, so as a bare minimum, you've got those documents saying we're conducting this in your area.
[03:25:52.261 --> 03:25:56.282]  And so I want to ask you, because there is global cooperation going on with this.
[03:25:57.103 --> 03:25:59.924]  Often people talk about the fact that they look on flight radar.
[03:26:00.184 --> 03:26:02.405]  They don't know what planes they are.
[03:26:02.910 --> 03:26:08.913]  A lot of people think these are predominantly military planes that aren't showing up on flight radar that are dropping this into the skies.
[03:26:09.373 --> 03:26:15.436]  Who is doing it, Dane, and who is it when you can't see which plane it is?
[03:26:16.996 --> 03:26:18.177]  Well, all roads lead to the money.
[03:26:18.217 --> 03:26:24.680]  And again, you're completely correct that the fact that you found all these publicized programs, how can people
[03:26:25.530 --> 03:26:30.254]  Look at that and not realize, of course, they're doing it on a much bigger scale and not disclosing it.
[03:26:30.374 --> 03:26:33.216]  I mean, it's certainly undeniably real and happening.
[03:26:33.716 --> 03:26:42.363]  So, you know, if people don't look at that, what you have investigated and discovered is proof and not much you can do to help those people, certainly.
[03:26:42.443 --> 03:26:45.485]  But in regard to those involved, again, we have
[03:26:46.818 --> 03:26:48.158]  Certainly military aircraft.
[03:26:48.198 --> 03:26:48.639]  The U.S.
[03:26:48.939 --> 03:26:51.519]  military, obviously the most powerful in the world.
[03:26:51.579 --> 03:26:56.481]  They have more aerial tankers than all other militaries combined in the world.
[03:26:56.541 --> 03:26:57.321]  So the U.S.
[03:26:57.341 --> 03:27:00.142]  military is certainly the biggest part of this equation.
[03:27:00.162 --> 03:27:03.243]  But we also have commercial aircraft with commercial markings involved.
[03:27:03.283 --> 03:27:12.766]  And I just yesterday did an extensive interview with a very sincere Australian Qantas veteran pilot of 30 plus years.
[03:27:13.772 --> 03:27:23.477]  And to his credit, he is absolutely acknowledging these operations are real and ongoing, but we're not implicating commercial pilots or personnel.
[03:27:23.757 --> 03:27:27.479]  And that was one thing we covered in the interview I did yesterday from Australia.
[03:27:28.359 --> 03:27:29.940]  But their aircraft are being used.
[03:27:30.000 --> 03:27:34.142]  We have film footage of that up close with dispersions turning on and off.
[03:27:34.402 --> 03:27:38.864]  And again, these are automated systems, so there would be no reason to involve commercial anybody.
[03:27:39.944 --> 03:27:42.366]  So, there's many layers to this.
[03:27:42.386 --> 03:27:43.566]  There's compartmentalization.
[03:27:43.586 --> 03:27:45.207]  The left hand doesn't know what the right hand's doing.
[03:27:45.707 --> 03:27:47.388]  And this is standard military practice.
[03:27:47.729 --> 03:27:54.032]  So, the bottom line is they're utilizing every aircraft they can to completely saturate the skies with light scattering particles.
[03:27:54.152 --> 03:28:00.956]  And to make this clear too, every single engineered flash freeze cool down like that which we see happening in the U.S.
[03:28:00.997 --> 03:28:06.620]  And by the way, the scheduled temperatures in a week, it's scheduled to be coast to coast in the U.S.
[03:28:07.609 --> 03:28:09.611]  Above to far above normal temperatures.
[03:28:09.811 --> 03:28:12.454]  Nature doesn't create that kind of whiplash event.
[03:28:13.034 --> 03:28:14.156]  This is climate engineering.
[03:28:15.317 --> 03:28:24.506]  But for every single cool down they create, Maria, because they're damaging what's left of the ozone layer, they're disrupting the hydrological cycle, they're killing the flora, the forests.
[03:28:25.749 --> 03:28:29.832]  Every event makes the overall damage to the planet worse, not better.
[03:28:30.292 --> 03:28:33.874]  And there are too many that are too invested in these operations to turn back.
[03:28:33.914 --> 03:28:43.801]  They're not going to turn back unless or until populations wake up to what's happening, especially our military brothers and sisters and their families, and people take to the streets and
[03:28:44.628 --> 03:28:45.308]  Put an end to this.
[03:28:45.468 --> 03:28:46.469]  That's what it's going to take.
[03:28:46.489 --> 03:28:47.909]  There's no form of legislation.
[03:28:49.370 --> 03:28:50.530]  We've got to get a break, Dane.
[03:28:50.590 --> 03:28:54.191]  We're going to continue this on the other side of the break, talking about action.
[03:28:54.251 --> 03:28:54.911]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:28:54.931 --> 03:28:56.272]  We're here with Dane Wigginton.
[03:28:56.692 --> 03:28:58.733]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's happening.
[03:28:59.213 --> 03:29:02.414]  Two years in the making, and we didn't plan it like this because we didn't know.
[03:29:03.248 --> 03:29:11.394]  To release Alex Jones New World Order Wars that's all about fighting Epstein and Clinton and Hillary and the Deep State and the pedo rings.
[03:29:11.534 --> 03:29:15.697]  Whole levels just dealing with that because that's the truth how they operate.
[03:29:15.977 --> 03:29:20.881]  And now the game went on Steam, the biggest online platform of video games in the world.
[03:29:20.901 --> 03:29:25.204]  150 million users a week and it already shot to number one.
[03:29:25.464 --> 03:29:31.188]  So find the link to Steam at alexjonesgame.com or search Alex Jones New World Order Wars
[03:29:31.528 --> 03:29:34.110]  Get it at Steam and get it for yourself.
[03:29:34.290 --> 03:29:37.913]  It's got an incredible 97% reviews.
[03:29:38.213 --> 03:29:43.057]  We'll put the link to Steam on screen and to AlexJonesGame.com.
[03:29:43.437 --> 03:29:43.737]  Get it.
[03:29:44.538 --> 03:29:45.899]  We are taking back the culture.
[03:29:45.919 --> 03:29:46.960]  We are taking things back.
[03:29:47.280 --> 03:29:50.062]  This will fund the Info War going into the election in the next 10 months.
[03:29:50.502 --> 03:29:52.204]  Don't let me fail you if you don't take action.
[03:29:52.264 --> 03:29:54.966]  Get New World Order Wars by Alex Jones now!
[03:29:56.636 --> 03:30:00.862]  The Second American Revolution is happening now right in front of you.
[03:30:01.182 --> 03:30:05.548]  And you're tuned in to InfoWars because you're either looking for the truth or you're already a Patreon.
[03:30:06.009 --> 03:30:13.859]  I'm asking you now to realize we are at the fulcrum, the crossroads, in the fight for human destiny and human future.
[03:30:14.500 --> 03:30:16.241]  Please spread the word about the broadcast.
[03:30:16.701 --> 03:30:21.963]  Please buy great products at FootwearStore.com and please pray for the transmission.
[03:30:22.223 --> 03:30:23.404]  Without you, we're going to fail.
[03:30:23.844 --> 03:30:32.928]  But if you simply take action and spread the word and pray for the broadcast and buy the products, you will continue to aid us together.
[03:30:33.288 --> 03:30:34.529]  In our victory against these tyrants.
[03:30:34.809 --> 03:30:36.390]  But now is the time to make the decision.
[03:30:36.930 --> 03:30:39.712]  I know there's millions of forms of media out there and all this BS.
[03:30:39.932 --> 03:30:41.713]  And the globalists hope you get lost in all of it.
[03:30:42.093 --> 03:30:46.736]  But notice the globalists, the New World Order, are coming after us because they realize we've got their number.
[03:30:47.616 --> 03:30:48.077]  Think about it.
[03:30:48.437 --> 03:30:49.738]  InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[03:30:49.758 --> 03:30:53.240]  If you want to support the tip of the spear, that decision is up to you.
[03:30:53.520 --> 03:30:55.101]  Please support us now at FullRestore.
[03:30:56.750 --> 03:31:02.217]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[03:31:02.958 --> 03:31:07.244]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[03:31:07.644 --> 03:31:12.030]  We finally have a limited run, back in supply, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:31:13.451 --> 03:31:16.213]  So many people have serious issues.
[03:31:16.494 --> 03:31:17.635]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[03:31:18.075 --> 03:31:23.479]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[03:31:24.020 --> 03:31:29.444]  Most other iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[03:31:30.044 --> 03:31:32.807]  But this is pure atomic certified
[03:31:34.702 --> 03:31:35.923]  I don't know.
[03:31:56.803 --> 03:32:00.911]  You know, I stood up here and I yelled and screamed about the New World Order and the globalists.
[03:32:00.931 --> 03:32:06.140]  They're planning to get rid of the borders and release a virus and have a global power grab and you saw it all come true.
[03:32:07.262 --> 03:32:07.983]  But there's a...
[03:32:09.122 --> 03:32:09.903]  Inverse of that.
[03:32:10.643 --> 03:32:15.647]  There's not just the bad stuff I'm telling you about, there's the good stuff I'm telling you about.
[03:32:16.387 --> 03:32:21.051]  And just like our information is the best you're going to find out there, our supplements are amazing.
[03:32:21.691 --> 03:32:25.454]  So our new special in the last half of January 2024 is here.
[03:32:25.954 --> 03:32:30.297]  It's Real Red Pill Plus and DNA Force Plus, both 50% off.
[03:32:30.478 --> 03:32:33.540]  We're calling it the Supercharged Special.
[03:32:34.200 --> 03:32:39.464]  You can get either one of these great items at 40% off individually or together for 50% off.
[03:32:39.764 --> 03:32:44.227]  Now the time we have left, I can't tell you why they're so great and what they do for your body.
[03:32:44.648 --> 03:32:49.371]  Go to InfoWarstore.com, look at the ingredients and investigate it and then get them.
[03:32:49.671 --> 03:32:52.173]  It supports the InfoWar and it'll change your life.
[03:32:52.754 --> 03:32:53.554]  Take advantage now!

[03:32:58.248 --> 03:33:02.343]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:33:02.865 --> 03:33:04.170]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:33:12.369 --> 03:33:14.051]  We're here with Dane Wigington.
[03:33:14.131 --> 03:33:16.253]  I tell people about the documentary The Dimming.
[03:33:16.273 --> 03:33:25.762]  You can find it on geoengineeringwatch.org, one of the best documentaries I've ever seen on this topic, on the topic of weather, warfare, geoengineering.
[03:33:25.802 --> 03:33:34.831]  Dane Wigington, I want to ask you about the commercial pilots you mentioned before the break, because I agree with you they're not all implicated, but do they not have
[03:33:35.251 --> 03:33:38.753]  Because I was listening to a pilot recently who was a whistleblower.
[03:33:38.793 --> 03:33:40.555]  His face and his voice were disguised.
[03:33:40.895 --> 03:33:48.580]  But he was saying from the UK that they have to declare or they have to be aware if there's dangerous chemicals on board.
[03:33:48.900 --> 03:33:54.084]  So wouldn't they have some sort of an indication that they were transporting dangerous hazardous materials?
[03:33:55.445 --> 03:33:56.685]  Very good point, Maria.
[03:33:56.946 --> 03:33:58.186]  I certainly agree with you.
[03:33:58.206 --> 03:34:03.050]  And this comes down to, let's look at the medical industrial complex.
[03:34:04.150 --> 03:34:14.579]  The whole of which continues to try to convince populations that vaccines are, quote, safe and effective in spite of a mountain of growing data to the contrary over many, many decades.
[03:34:14.639 --> 03:34:16.620]  So they certainly should know.
[03:34:17.241 --> 03:34:20.423]  Again, we have an ally in Australia now that definitely knows.
[03:34:20.684 --> 03:34:24.747]  And we are communicating with commercial pilots that absolutely know their aircraft are being used.
[03:34:24.787 --> 03:34:30.732]  We're supplying them with our 20-page full-color fact and photo summary booklets that have
[03:34:32.452 --> 03:34:37.694]  Satellite images that are absolutely shockingly inarguable as to climate engineering operations being conducted.
[03:34:37.914 --> 03:34:49.679]  A copy of the federal gag order, the illegal gag order that's on the National Weather Service and NOAA right now, and they're leaving those in pilot lunchrooms very covertly to try to alert other pilots, again, as if they shouldn't know already.
[03:34:50.399 --> 03:34:56.902]  And I know this issue is incredibly hard to assimilate and to face, but as Alex said,
[03:34:57.620 --> 03:35:03.764]  In the previous break, I think, the only way we can make a difference is to fully face the dark horizon.
[03:35:03.784 --> 03:35:05.325]  I mean, that's absolutely the case.
[03:35:05.885 --> 03:35:07.866]  And that's the only place that solace lies.
[03:35:08.867 --> 03:35:10.408]  Not in pretending it isn't happening.
[03:35:10.628 --> 03:35:12.829]  Not in pretending someone else will take care of it.
[03:35:13.329 --> 03:35:17.612]  But in each of us doing our part, that's the only way we can truly make a difference.
[03:35:17.852 --> 03:35:20.413]  And again, we can hide from a vaccine.
[03:35:20.594 --> 03:35:22.675]  We can hide from certain types of threats.
[03:35:23.433 --> 03:35:35.809]  But when they're literally destroying the planet's life support systems, contaminating virtually everything from the clouds to the ground, every breath we take, and they can put much more lethal elements in this anytime they want, how is that not a fight for life?
[03:35:37.153 --> 03:35:37.993]  I agree with you, Dane.
[03:35:38.734 --> 03:35:44.016]  I want to ask you, you said before that the New Hampshire bill, not very likely.
[03:35:44.716 --> 03:35:45.497]  Why do you think that?
[03:35:45.517 --> 03:35:47.858]  Do you think it's because there isn't the public awareness?
[03:35:49.158 --> 03:35:58.503]  Or is it because it's unlikely that most of the people are going to vote correctly when it comes to voting on the bill?
[03:35:58.583 --> 03:35:59.023]  What is it?
[03:36:01.232 --> 03:36:16.656]  People within the sphere of government, even though you have a couple that have drafted this legislation that appear to be trying to do something for the greater good, but there are many others within the system that will make it their business to make sure this does not pass.
[03:36:17.416 --> 03:36:18.996]  Rhode Island attempted this.
[03:36:19.276 --> 03:36:20.857]  It's been about three years ago.
[03:36:21.197 --> 03:36:28.219]  Geoengineeringwatch.org sent our top attorney to speak there, and he definitely disseminated inarguable data.
[03:36:28.959 --> 03:36:29.819]  Nevertheless, it was
[03:36:30.658 --> 03:36:31.198]  was killed.
[03:36:31.679 --> 03:36:33.880]  So, this is what we would expect.
[03:36:33.900 --> 03:36:41.825]  YouEngineWatch.org sued a scientist that represents Caltech, Carnegie Science, MIT, and Cornell.
[03:36:42.586 --> 03:36:50.551]  He's the scientist that single-handedly got the dimming censored on Facebook and we knew, we believed that the system would side with him.
[03:36:51.638 --> 03:36:53.820]  But we sued him anyway, and the system did side with him.
[03:36:53.840 --> 03:36:56.283]  They basically said he's not responsible for anything he does.
[03:36:56.323 --> 03:36:57.104]  Now, how can that be?
[03:36:57.625 --> 03:37:05.513]  When he did something maliciously to damage not just geoengineeringwatch.org, but public awareness, and that's what matters most.
[03:37:05.573 --> 03:37:09.818]  But what we did get out of this lawsuit is coverage from places like Bloomberg News.
[03:37:09.858 --> 03:37:13.222]  They covered the fact that we sued these climate scientists that are
[03:37:13.948 --> 03:37:17.390]  In fact, playing the part of a climate engineering cover-up actor.
[03:37:17.730 --> 03:37:19.291]  That's exactly what they're doing.
[03:37:19.792 --> 03:37:31.859]  And what I would argue, Maria, if we can fully expose this, every single individual from the climate scientists that I described, in this case Dr. Douglas McMartin and David Keith, the world's most recognized climate scientist,
[03:37:33.112 --> 03:37:53.567]  And every single weatherman, every single TV news anchor, anybody, every agency, every person within every agency, every elected official, they'll have a lot of explaining to do to a public that will be justifiably enraged at what's been done to them and for all these people, again, playing a part in these crimes by helping to cover them up.
[03:37:55.208 --> 03:38:00.472]  Who was the one that in one of your documentaries said, we're riding on the coattails of our grandkids?
[03:38:00.492 --> 03:38:01.333]  Was that David Keith?
[03:38:02.483 --> 03:38:03.865]  That's Dr. David Keith.
[03:38:03.905 --> 03:38:07.809]  He is the face of climate engineering disinformation.
[03:38:07.829 --> 03:38:11.914]  For listeners that haven't seen that, they can see him on the record, on film, stating that.
[03:38:12.554 --> 03:38:13.655]  And what else did he say?
[03:38:13.675 --> 03:38:17.800]  And again, I asked him these questions at an international climate engineering conference.
[03:38:18.020 --> 03:38:21.945]  I was one of about a hundred researchers with a press pass.
[03:38:21.965 --> 03:38:23.246]  They allowed about three questions.
[03:38:23.326 --> 03:38:23.867]  I was one.
[03:38:24.801 --> 03:38:38.024]  And when I confronted Dr. Keith as to his proposal to dump 10 to 20 million tons of aluminum nanoparticles into the atmosphere annually, that's an inconceivable amount of highly toxic material.
[03:38:38.064 --> 03:38:49.006]  When I confronted him, had they done any toxicological studies at all, his first response, paraphrased, was, we've looked at this, there's a lot of particulate matter in the sky anyway, a little more won't hurt.
[03:38:49.617 --> 03:38:50.137]  Wait a minute.
[03:38:50.757 --> 03:38:53.898]  The particular matter that's in our sky isn't aluminum nanoparticles.
[03:38:53.958 --> 03:38:54.879]  Have you studied that?
[03:38:55.819 --> 03:38:57.879]  His final response was, no.
[03:38:58.219 --> 03:38:59.700]  Could terrible things happen tomorrow?
[03:38:59.940 --> 03:39:00.620]  We don't know.
[03:39:01.360 --> 03:39:03.061]  But the fact is, they do know.
[03:39:03.201 --> 03:39:13.984]  And think about that kind of response from the world's most recognized climate engineer, as if he doesn't know that spraying highly bioavailable and bioaccumulative aluminum nanoparticles into the air that we all get to breathe
[03:39:14.858 --> 03:39:16.020]  Is not going to do harm?
[03:39:16.240 --> 03:39:17.501]  Of course they know.
[03:39:17.762 --> 03:39:18.563]  Of course they do it.
[03:39:18.643 --> 03:39:25.852]  In a population that is less cognitively functional and less healthy, it's much easier to control, aren't they?
[03:39:27.708 --> 03:39:28.288]  Absolutely.
[03:39:28.368 --> 03:39:39.332]  John Kerry just, I believe, announced that he's going to step down from his role of climate czar to help Joe Biden with his campaign, because unless Joe Biden's president, we can't stop climate change.
[03:39:39.952 --> 03:39:41.732]  We can't do anything about climate change.
[03:39:41.792 --> 03:39:50.275]  It's like you madmen all over the world are on record saying that you are engineering the weather
[03:39:51.076 --> 03:39:52.356]  And you're the ones causing it.
[03:39:52.796 --> 03:39:58.338]  I think it was you, Dane, that said to me, essentially, climate change is real, but they're causing it.
[03:39:58.618 --> 03:40:00.658]  You know, we all say climate change is the biggest scam.
[03:40:00.678 --> 03:40:02.298]  No, no, these guys are causing it.
[03:40:04.479 --> 03:40:09.520]  That wouldn't have been me in that I certainly were focused on climate engineering.
[03:40:09.560 --> 03:40:11.740]  Geoengineering Watchdog is focused on climate engineering.
[03:40:11.780 --> 03:40:17.862]  And the bottom line is there can be no legitimate discussion about climate anything without addressing climate engineering first and foremost.
[03:40:17.942 --> 03:40:19.322]  But in regard to the state of the climate,
[03:40:19.998 --> 03:40:24.704]  Again, it's important for us all to remember we've been really, really bad stewards of the planet.
[03:40:24.864 --> 03:40:25.645]  No doubt about that.
[03:40:25.745 --> 03:40:29.770]  And every form of human activity that affects the energy balance of the planet is a part of the problem.
[03:40:29.790 --> 03:40:31.472]  We acknowledge that at geometryandwatch.org.
[03:40:31.492 --> 03:40:38.600]  But that being said, clearing has prevented the planet from responding to the damage done.
[03:40:39.309 --> 03:40:41.211]  And that's the biggest problem of all.
[03:40:41.611 --> 03:41:01.591]  So, when you poison soils, soil microbiome, which is being virtually sterilized by the toxic rainfall from the fallout of these programs, and you have boreal forests, the lungs of the planet, that now are no longer carbon sinks, they're no longer absorbing carbon and releasing oxygen, because their stomata, their respiratory ports are shutting, the organisms are shutting down.
[03:41:02.231 --> 03:41:07.093]  So we have, again, the remaining life support systems of the planet being disabled by climate engineering.
[03:41:07.133 --> 03:41:11.075]  So we want to focus on that first and foremost when we can stop that.
[03:41:12.155 --> 03:41:15.676]  If and when we can stop that, we can assess the rest of the damage being done.
[03:41:16.057 --> 03:41:21.559]  We're just simply saying because we don't want to alienate those in the environmental communities and those that we need in this battle.
[03:41:22.019 --> 03:41:29.142]  So we want to acknowledge that, yes, we have been very bad stewards of the planet, but if we have a single human activity that's doing more damage
[03:41:30.060 --> 03:41:33.483]  Then all of the rest, shouldn't we focus on that first?
[03:41:33.663 --> 03:41:42.631]  And how can we have a legitimate discussion about the climate, again, from any perspective, without addressing the biggest single interference of all, climate engineering?
[03:41:44.313 --> 03:41:47.515]  Out of interest, Dane, who was the pilot out of Australia that you spoke with?
[03:41:50.458 --> 03:41:54.301]  His name is Graham... Graham Hood.
[03:41:54.341 --> 03:41:54.902]  Graham Hood.
[03:41:56.380 --> 03:41:57.200]  Oh yes, yes.
[03:41:57.260 --> 03:41:58.781]  He's a wonderful, wonderful man.
[03:41:59.261 --> 03:42:00.501]  Yeah, he's a wonderful man.
[03:42:00.541 --> 03:42:01.682]  Very courageous man.
[03:42:02.202 --> 03:42:06.183]  You know, served in the Bali bombings as well, I think.
[03:42:06.483 --> 03:42:08.384]  So he's just, he's just a great guy.
[03:42:08.424 --> 03:42:11.345]  And for the longest time he was saying, no, it's not possible.
[03:42:11.365 --> 03:42:12.445]  Chemtrails don't exist.
[03:42:12.865 --> 03:42:20.890]  Um, and I think, you know, obviously everyone see this is what I'm trying to get to this point where, you know, I mentioned people said, no, it's not happening.
[03:42:20.930 --> 03:42:27.594]  I find it hard to believe, uh, you know, pilots, a lot of pilots would think there's, there's just no way, you know, we fly these airlines.
[03:42:27.614 --> 03:42:28.294]  There's just no way.
[03:42:28.314 --> 03:42:31.316]  Um, but, but these are well-meaning people who are.
[03:42:31.676 --> 03:42:36.261]  Really waking up to more and more and more of the agenda as time goes on.
[03:42:36.281 --> 03:42:39.183]  We have to bring those people along on the journey like you were talking about.
[03:42:39.203 --> 03:42:41.305]  We don't want to alienate the environmentalists.
[03:42:41.326 --> 03:42:44.809]  We want to bring them along on this battle for humanity.
[03:42:44.829 --> 03:42:49.093]  So I want to talk to you about that battle and the action plan moving forward right after this short break.
[03:42:49.133 --> 03:42:52.336]  We're here with Dane Wigington of geoengineeringwatch.org.
[03:42:52.696 --> 03:42:53.357]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:53.397 --> 03:42:53.998]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:56.765 --> 03:43:01.049]  29 years on air, all I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalists.
[03:43:01.770 --> 03:43:07.095]  And I've done the best job I can to tell the truth and be accurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[03:43:07.476 --> 03:43:10.018]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves.
[03:43:10.458 --> 03:43:14.842]  Unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people, we don't do that.
[03:43:15.303 --> 03:43:17.185]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[03:43:17.565 --> 03:43:19.587]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product.
[03:43:19.627 --> 03:43:20.228]  It's so powerful.
[03:43:21.128 --> 03:43:26.134]  This is the breakdown product, after your cells process it, of folic acid.
[03:43:26.695 --> 03:43:31.180]  Methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[03:43:31.661 --> 03:43:32.882]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[03:43:32.922 --> 03:43:33.783]  It's not a stimulant.
[03:43:34.023 --> 03:43:35.846]  It energizes your cells.
[03:43:36.406 --> 03:43:38.929]  And then everything else you take just supercharges it.
[03:43:38.949 --> 03:43:39.789]  It's so insane.
[03:43:40.130 --> 03:43:41.631]  It's foundational energy.
[03:43:42.112 --> 03:43:46.256]  The strongest formula out there at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:43:46.636 --> 03:43:50.660]  It doesn't just energize this operation against the tyrants, it energizes you.
[03:43:50.680 --> 03:43:52.382]  Get foundational energy now!
[03:43:56.266 --> 03:43:57.527]  Bodies is back!

[03:44:05.072 --> 03:44:10.076]  Utilized for thousands of years, tumeric is one of the most studied medicinal herbs today.
[03:44:10.456 --> 03:44:18.102]  Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles are published every year on the chemistry and therapeutic potential of tumeric and its active components.
[03:44:18.302 --> 03:44:28.952]  Tumeric bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body, help boost and support flexibility, increase mobility, assist in joint function, bolster your immune system, and so much more.
[03:44:29.312 --> 03:44:41.083]  Regular tumeric from the store contains about 1-5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids, but our super powerful extract using bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients in tumeric.
[03:44:41.303 --> 03:44:44.527]  No other product can compare with this cucuminoid delivery system.
[03:44:44.787 --> 03:44:48.411]  So if you want to put the true power of turmeric to the test, then look no further.
[03:44:48.631 --> 03:44:54.899]  Grab yourself a bottle today for 25% off at InfoWareStore.com and put your body at ease.
[03:44:56.220 --> 03:45:00.324]  The Second American Revolution is happening now right in front of you.
[03:45:00.645 --> 03:45:05.009]  And you're tuned in InfoWars because you're either looking for the truth or you're already a Patron.
[03:45:05.470 --> 03:45:13.318]  I'm asking you now to realize we are at the fulcrum, the crossroads, in the fight for human destiny and human future.
[03:45:13.979 --> 03:45:15.720]  Please spread the word about the broadcast.
[03:45:16.160 --> 03:45:18.161]  Please buy great products at FortWorthStore.com.
[03:45:18.481 --> 03:45:21.423]  And please pray for the transmission.
[03:45:21.683 --> 03:45:22.863]  Without you, we're going to fail.
[03:45:23.324 --> 03:45:32.388]  But if you simply take action and spread the word and pray for the broadcast and buy the products, you will continue to aid us together.
[03:45:32.748 --> 03:45:33.969]  In our victory against these tyrants.
[03:45:34.269 --> 03:45:35.850]  But now is the time to make the decision.
[03:45:36.391 --> 03:45:39.173]  I know there's millions of forms of media out there and all this BS.
[03:45:39.393 --> 03:45:41.194]  And the globalists hope you get lost in all of it.
[03:45:41.554 --> 03:45:46.198]  But notice the globalists, the New World Order, are coming after us because they realize we've got their number.
[03:45:47.098 --> 03:45:47.559]  Think about it.
[03:45:47.899 --> 03:45:49.300]  InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[03:45:49.920 --> 03:45:51.141]  You want to support the tip of the spear?
[03:45:51.522 --> 03:45:52.702]  That decision's up to you.

[03:45:56.818 --> 03:46:03.963]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days, with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large.
[03:46:04.503 --> 03:46:12.288]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep support formula, Down and Out, is just the thing.
[03:46:13.049 --> 03:46:19.413]  It's our new, faster-absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[03:46:19.991 --> 03:46:20.371]  I think so.
[03:46:39.255 --> 03:46:45.499]  Which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[03:46:45.899 --> 03:46:51.763]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will be down and out.

[03:46:58.608 --> 03:47:04.492]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:12.713 --> 03:47:13.153]  Welcome back.
[03:47:13.193 --> 03:47:17.154]  We're here with our last segment with Dane Whittington.
[03:47:17.715 --> 03:47:20.895]  Before, earlier in the broadcast, Dane, you sent me a picture.
[03:47:21.115 --> 03:47:24.456]  If the team have got that, we want to bring that up right now.
[03:47:24.536 --> 03:47:37.039]  You made mention of the fact that the local weather operations, sort of the local spraying and things like what the NOAA has posted, are really more of a distraction to the wider operations.
[03:47:37.079 --> 03:47:39.200]  I want to hear about those wider operations.
[03:47:40.110 --> 03:47:44.133]  And you even said, you know, it's kind of an unsaid agreement between countries.
[03:47:44.734 --> 03:47:46.175]  They will keep doing this.
[03:47:47.316 --> 03:47:54.181]  Can you just explain the distinction between local weather modification operations and the wider operation?
[03:47:56.583 --> 03:48:01.227]  Well, again, the local operations are completely negated by climate intervention operations.
[03:48:01.247 --> 03:48:02.928]  They're simply designed as a distraction.
[03:48:03.712 --> 03:48:05.593]  What you see in that map is extremely important.
[03:48:05.613 --> 03:48:09.757]  That is a departure from normal surface temperature map.
[03:48:10.417 --> 03:48:16.121]  The deeper the blues, the colder it is, the more of a departure from what is, quote, normal.
[03:48:16.662 --> 03:48:19.384]  And the reds and oranges, and forgive my colors if they're a little off.
[03:48:19.424 --> 03:48:20.244]  I am colorblind.
[03:48:20.284 --> 03:48:22.426]  I can see the, I can, I know the difference here.
[03:48:22.466 --> 03:48:23.206]  I mean, I can see the map.
[03:48:23.226 --> 03:48:24.587]  The colors look different to me than others.
[03:48:25.148 --> 03:48:28.550]  But that's very clear where it's cold and where it's not.
[03:48:29.111 --> 03:48:31.913]  So when you have Texas colder
[03:48:32.862 --> 03:48:37.724]  In parts of Greenland in the Arctic, something is clearly radically wrong.
[03:48:38.124 --> 03:48:55.869]  And that's what people don't know when they're watching these sensationalized weather channel climate engineering cover-up actors talking about how cold it is when, again, places like Denver that in the last five years has routinely gone from literally 85 degree all-time record highs to single digits in less than 24 hours.
[03:48:55.889 --> 03:48:56.790]  That is not nature.
[03:48:58.630 --> 03:49:01.471]  That's chemical ice nucleation cloud seeding operations.
[03:49:01.491 --> 03:49:02.912]  These are patented processes.
[03:49:03.492 --> 03:49:07.334]  Causes an unbelievable cool down at the surface that may be only a few hundred feet thick.
[03:49:07.794 --> 03:49:14.097]  Again, we're speaking to pilots that are acknowledging they're seeing a temperature increase of 20, 30 degrees when they get a thousand feet off the deck.
[03:49:14.438 --> 03:49:16.459]  That's completely wrong and unnatural.
[03:49:16.499 --> 03:49:20.741]  So the map you just showed, again, reflecting that it is literally warmer.
[03:49:20.761 --> 03:49:25.783]  In fact, Greenland, less than a week ago, recorded temperatures of 12 degrees C above
[03:49:28.645 --> 03:49:37.833]  Positive 12 degrees C, so we're somewhere in the range of 45-50 degrees in Greenland, while it's near zero in Dallas or Louisiana.
[03:49:37.853 --> 03:49:40.475]  I mean, this is completely insane, completely unnatural.
[03:49:40.515 --> 03:49:41.476]  It will not last.
[03:49:42.136 --> 03:49:50.303]  Every single time they carry out an operation like this, doing immense damage to crops, infrastructure, people, wildlife.
[03:49:51.073 --> 03:49:55.995]  But the rebound, the weather whiplash rebound is coming, and I just sent you another map.
[03:49:56.015 --> 03:50:04.518]  I'm not sure if you'll be able to post that or not, but it's the next week's scheduled weather from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
[03:50:04.598 --> 03:50:05.178]  What does it show?
[03:50:05.738 --> 03:50:11.560]  Coast to coast in the U.S., from above to far above to record high temperatures.
[03:50:12.469 --> 03:50:12.909]  In a week.
[03:50:13.670 --> 03:50:14.411]  Think about that.
[03:50:14.611 --> 03:50:23.858]  So again, what I want to state and make clear, and I know, as again Alex said on the break, that it's hard to face the horizon, and it is difficult, but it's much more difficult not to.
[03:50:23.918 --> 03:50:27.480]  You can't hide in your cabin on the Titanic and think that's going to save you.
[03:50:28.501 --> 03:50:31.463]  You have to deal with the hole in the bottom of the boat or the boat's going to go down.
[03:50:31.484 --> 03:50:38.849]  Our time horizon on the current course is extremely short, and I don't mean centuries or decades.
[03:50:39.430 --> 03:50:41.051]  If we continue on the current course
[03:50:42.046 --> 03:50:48.328]  Mathematically and statistically, we could face extinction by the end of this decade.
[03:50:48.348 --> 03:50:52.949]  And I know people will roll their eyes and walk away from that as if I've lost my mind.
[03:50:53.689 --> 03:50:56.810]  I asked them to look at statistics today, right now.
[03:50:57.050 --> 03:51:01.412]  We've lost 80 to 90% of Earth's insect populations today.
[03:51:01.912 --> 03:51:03.492]  How many bugs do you see in your windshield?
[03:51:03.572 --> 03:51:04.012]  Not many.
[03:51:04.673 --> 03:51:08.514]  And plankton populations... No insects, no people, by the way.
[03:51:08.554 --> 03:51:09.294]  Let's make that clear.
[03:51:10.051 --> 03:51:12.613]  Plankton population is down 90% in the Atlantic.
[03:51:13.354 --> 03:51:12.613]  90%!
[03:51:13.694 --> 03:51:15.555]  That's measured in 500 locations.
[03:51:16.056 --> 03:51:28.145]  Ozone layer, Maria, our NASA contract engineer that meters for us, with equipment we supply at MGEngineeringWatch.org, estimates right now we have about 23% of Earth's ozone layer remaining.
[03:51:28.205 --> 03:51:37.632]  It's, of course, thinner at the polar regions, thicker in other regions, it waxes and wanes, but once we hit functional collapse of the ozone layer, can't grow food, no plankton,
[03:51:39.022 --> 03:51:41.123]  And it's a matter of whatever you have in your cupboard.
[03:51:41.143 --> 03:51:42.384]  That's how long you're going to live.
[03:51:42.944 --> 03:51:47.566]  And again, we face that on the current trajectory in the next few years.
[03:51:48.326 --> 03:51:51.447]  And climate engineering, single biggest factor destroying the ozone layer.
[03:51:51.528 --> 03:51:54.309]  So, bottom line is, those in power know this.
[03:51:54.529 --> 03:51:56.970]  And here's the biggest variable of all, Marie, and I'll give it back to you.
[03:51:58.442 --> 03:52:16.615]  At the point that those in power can't mask the true severity and immediacy of what's unfolding from populations, and populations are about to panic, that's when you can expect those in power to play very big cards, like the next pathogen that the World Health Organization is already warning us is coming, that they say will be 20 times worse than COVID.
[03:52:16.635 --> 03:52:17.536]  You've seen that, I'm sure.
[03:52:19.153 --> 03:52:20.154]  I have, absolutely.
[03:52:20.194 --> 03:52:25.658]  They're talking about Disease X, a hypothetical that they're already developing mRNA injections for.
[03:52:25.698 --> 03:52:30.422]  I mean, you're developing injections for a hypothetical disease.
[03:52:30.822 --> 03:52:35.385]  It's really amazing how they're so talented, Dane.
[03:52:37.406 --> 03:52:45.433]  I guess this is something that I've been really looking at from the start of this year, because I know that we have the deadline of the international health regulations.
[03:52:45.493 --> 03:52:49.957]  The WHO wants to amend those regulations by May.
[03:52:50.338 --> 03:52:55.302]  Mind you, the deadline for them to submit their amendments is the 27th of January.
[03:52:55.683 --> 03:52:59.226]  However, they've said they're not going to meet that deadline, which actually makes
[03:52:59.506 --> 03:53:07.976]  The International Health Regulations amendments null and void under the existing Article 55 of the IHR, but they won't tell you that.
[03:53:08.637 --> 03:53:15.545]  Much like Antonio Guterres with his political declaration last year, just earlier in the broadcast, Alex and Kirk Elliott were talking about this.
[03:53:16.125 --> 03:53:27.454]  The emergency platform information that Kirk Elliott covered includes events in the sky, events in space, climate emergencies.
[03:53:27.554 --> 03:53:32.778]  It includes these things that essentially give Antonio Guterres dictatorial power over the whole world.
[03:53:33.118 --> 03:53:39.803]  And what happened, Dane, was come September of last year when I was in the States, I was actually warning about this and I said the United Nations
[03:53:40.183 --> 03:53:40.843]  We're good to go.
[03:54:06.471 --> 03:54:08.092]  And no doubt involved in this.
[03:54:08.212 --> 03:54:17.537]  And so I guess, you know, Dane, the possibilities are really endless, especially when you're talking about things like Disease X, things like events in the sky, climate events.
[03:54:17.757 --> 03:54:19.899]  All of these things are absolutely possible.
[03:54:19.939 --> 03:54:24.781]  I want to encourage everyone to watch previous interviews I've done with Dane or even watch, you know,
[03:54:26.062 --> 03:54:32.089]  Geoengineeringwatch.org, in my opinion, is one of the best resources in the world for this information.
[03:54:32.129 --> 03:54:34.712]  I direct everyone I possibly can to your website, Dane.
[03:54:36.133 --> 03:54:37.655]  I've never told you that, but I do often.
[03:54:38.576 --> 03:54:43.361]  And so, you know, considering what these people want to implement,
[03:54:44.278 --> 03:54:45.139]  What are your thoughts?
[03:54:45.239 --> 03:54:46.279]  We've got about three minutes left.
[03:54:46.319 --> 03:54:57.225]  What are your thoughts about where they may go in terms of disease X, causing further freezing events and things of this nature before the 2024 election?
[03:54:57.565 --> 03:55:00.367]  I know you said that that's part of it, but not the grander scheme.
[03:55:00.427 --> 03:55:01.227]  I understand that.
[03:55:02.108 --> 03:55:06.610]  But do you think that they're going to potentially cause a disease through what they're spraying?
[03:55:06.871 --> 03:55:08.892]  And what do people need to do about it right now?
[03:55:11.393 --> 03:55:13.074]  What's important to understand is that
[03:55:13.826 --> 03:55:20.372]  You can shut all forms of human activity off now, right now, today, including climate engineering, and we are going to hit the wall.
[03:55:20.812 --> 03:55:25.336]  If you have a car going 100 miles an hour, 10 feet from impact, you can put the brakes on all you want.
[03:55:25.716 --> 03:55:26.737]  You are going to hit.
[03:55:27.298 --> 03:55:28.519]  And that's our current situation.
[03:55:28.559 --> 03:55:30.621]  That's what so many people are having such a hard time dealing with.
[03:55:30.661 --> 03:55:35.865]  The map that you showed a moment ago, that your producer showed, that's what's scheduled for the next week.
[03:55:36.106 --> 03:55:38.668]  So those areas that are record cold now,
[03:55:39.810 --> 03:55:44.855]  are literally at least what is scheduled from NOAA to be record high in a week.
[03:55:45.295 --> 03:55:46.456]  That is not nature.
[03:55:47.097 --> 03:55:55.404]  So bottom line is when the biosphere stops functioning from this massive interference and on top of all the other forms of human damage to the planet, we're done.
[03:55:55.764 --> 03:56:06.134]  It's over at that point and we have people sleepwalking around about their lives, Maria, with their iPhones in their hand with no clue of the oncoming train with the lights flashing and the horns blaring.
[03:56:06.992 --> 03:56:09.215]  We are perilously close to impact.
[03:56:09.436 --> 03:56:18.669]  What we can do right now, all of us, each of us, if we arm ourselves with credible data, GeoengineeringWatch.org again strives to be that source, arm yourself with credible data.
[03:56:18.689 --> 03:56:22.354]  When you pass this issue on, don't point at the sky and just rant, because that shuts people down.
[03:56:23.092 --> 03:56:27.776]  But again, just like, as you mentioned, with Graham Hood from Australia, exceptional individual.
[03:56:27.856 --> 03:56:29.417]  I was so impressed with him.
[03:56:29.997 --> 03:56:32.559]  So sincere, and his colleague John also.
[03:56:33.040 --> 03:56:40.245]  Very sincere people that are now waking up to this issue with great courage, and we need others to do the same.
[03:56:40.625 --> 03:56:50.673]  But when you share credible data, you start a spot fire of awareness, and if you stoke that spot fire of awareness with more credible data, and you wake that person up, and they wake up too, and those two wake up two more,
[03:56:51.113 --> 03:56:52.675]  Now we have an exponential equation.
[03:56:52.835 --> 03:56:59.964]  If we can reach a critical mass of awareness, we will have so many others joining us in this battle, just like Graham and John from Australia.
[03:57:00.765 --> 03:57:07.294]  And as we add to the ranks of this army of the awakened, now we have a chance of making a difference, even at this late hour.
[03:57:09.122 --> 03:57:10.084]  I agree with you, Dane.
[03:57:10.484 --> 03:57:19.278]  We are so, so grateful for all of the research that you've done and all of the resources that are available to people on geoengineeringwatch.org.
[03:57:19.318 --> 03:57:22.363]  You know, when I'm having conversations with people about the COVID injections,
[03:57:22.799 --> 03:57:25.641]  I convinced them because I know some data.
[03:57:25.802 --> 03:57:27.303]  I know some cold, hard facts.
[03:57:27.383 --> 03:57:28.704]  I've read the Pfizer documents.
[03:57:29.044 --> 03:57:31.726]  And so you need to be equipped and armed with this knowledge.
[03:57:32.127 --> 03:57:34.809]  Dane Whittington, thank you again so much for your time today.
[03:57:34.849 --> 03:57:36.110]  And thank you to the InfoWars crew.
[03:57:36.130 --> 03:57:37.251]  They've done a great job today.
[03:57:37.671 --> 03:57:38.892]  We'll see you all very, very soon.
[03:57:38.952 --> 03:57:40.614]  I'll be back next week, hopefully.
[03:57:40.754 --> 03:57:41.334]  Oh, sorry, Dane.
[03:57:42.175 --> 03:57:42.796]  We're out of time.
[03:57:42.856 --> 03:57:43.937]  Thank you so much again.
[03:57:46.979 --> 03:57:47.800]  Winter is coming.
[03:57:48.480 --> 03:57:49.061]  Winter is coming.
[03:57:49.403 --> 03:57:50.490]  Winter is coming.
[03:57:50.892 --> 03:57:51.656]  Winter is coming.
[03:57:51.958 --> 03:57:53.044]  Winter is coming!
[03:57:54.065 --> 03:57:55.565]  Winter is coming.
[03:57:55.886 --> 03:57:57.266]  Winter isn't coming.
[03:57:57.846 --> 03:57:59.147]  Winter is here.

[03:58:46.557 --> 03:58:51.861]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing, high-quality coffee has not been available.
[03:58:52.321 --> 03:58:56.704]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[03:58:57.144 --> 03:58:59.606]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[03:59:00.166 --> 03:59:09.552]  But now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.
[03:59:09.752 --> 03:59:12.394]  It's powered by the company Minuteman Coffee.
[03:59:12.994 --> 03:59:21.022]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best-tasting, best-smelling, strongest coffee that I have ever drank.
