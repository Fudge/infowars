[00:00:15.828 --> 00:00:16.588]  InfoWars.
[00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.530]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:27.898]  InfoWars.com first wrote articles in 2004 about replacement migration.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.360]  You can look it up.
[00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.080]  They're on the site.
[00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:36.982]  We are the first to break it anywhere.
[00:00:38.122 --> 00:00:42.303]  And that's kind of shameful because it was in UN documents in 2000-2001.
[00:00:44.284 --> 00:00:46.565]  Well, now the crisis has come to a head.
[00:00:46.585 --> 00:00:53.947]  14 states have joined with Texas in defiance of the hijacked criminal federal government.
[00:00:55.868 --> 00:00:58.789]  And many of the states are sending their state guard
[00:01:00.186 --> 00:01:00.786]  We're good to go.
[00:01:00.806 --> 00:01:01.207]  We're good to go.
[00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.631]  So we have the latest list.
[00:01:29.671 --> 00:01:32.513]  More states are coming on board every few hours.
[00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:37.177]  Operation Lone Star bolsters historic border security mission 2023.
[00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:42.941]  This is directly from the state of Texas and the governor's office.
[00:01:43.802 --> 00:01:54.651]  In total, 14 states, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Idaho, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming...
[00:01:55.953 --> 00:02:03.615]  ...have stepped up to support Texas efforts and deployed personnel and resources to secure the border in President Biden's absence.
[00:02:05.735 --> 00:02:06.495]  That's right, folks.
[00:02:07.275 --> 00:02:19.358]  If you know your next-door neighbors and they've got two or three little kids and those little kids are running out of the house all day and now it's nighttime and they're in the backyard crying...
[00:02:20.691 --> 00:02:21.191]  We're good to go.
[00:02:46.181 --> 00:02:47.061]  They say, we don't know.
[00:02:47.121 --> 00:02:48.162]  Well, then you call the police.
[00:02:49.803 --> 00:02:51.244]  The border is not just wide open.
[00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:59.331]  The feds are down there catapulting the illegal aliens or fuel injecting them, supercharging them into the country.
[00:03:00.932 --> 00:03:03.514]  So Abbott has now expanded putting up barbed wire.
[00:03:04.835 --> 00:03:11.460]  And so the Democratic Party has officially called, Nancy Pelosi's officially called, I've got all the articles right here, for...
[00:03:12.543 --> 00:03:17.285]  The president to declare an emergency, which he can do, and nationalize the state guards.
[00:03:18.786 --> 00:03:20.267]  And that gets into how all those laws work.
[00:03:21.828 --> 00:03:29.391]  So border battle line, Dems call on Biden to seize control of Texas National Guard as GOP allies back Abbott.
[00:03:30.732 --> 00:03:38.116]  So when this all started kicking up last week, I said, look, Abbott's making a real move here.
[00:03:39.554 --> 00:03:44.995]  And a lot of people criticized me and said, you know, Abbott's been a traitor and went along with some of the lockdowns and we don't like him.
[00:03:45.035 --> 00:03:55.498]  Hey, putting the guard down there to block the border and put up barbed wire and not let the illegals in and to not aid in the processing was a bold move.
[00:03:55.538 --> 00:03:56.558]  Let's not say it wasn't.
[00:03:57.158 --> 00:03:59.139]  And I think we can say again, Alex Jones was right.
[00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:00.979]  This is very real.
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.340]  Just like the invasion's real.
[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.101]  And so it is public pressure on these governors
[00:04:07.967 --> 00:04:08.347]  We're good to go.
[00:04:38.018 --> 00:04:39.439]  To skin the cat.
[00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:43.220]  Or skin the rabbit, as they say.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.102]  But we're going to be going over all of it here today.
[00:04:46.162 --> 00:04:50.584]  Got some big guests as well on this subject and so much other news.
[00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:52.505]  Tucker Carlson's been on fire.
[00:04:52.525 --> 00:04:53.705]  Got some key clips of him.
[00:04:54.166 --> 00:04:54.746]  Please stay with us.
[00:05:01.332 --> 00:05:05.936]  29 years on air, all I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalists.
[00:05:06.657 --> 00:05:11.982]  And I've done the best job I can to tell those words that have been accurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[00:05:12.362 --> 00:05:18.808]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves, unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people.
[00:05:19.048 --> 00:05:19.729]  We don't do that.
[00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:22.091]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[00:05:22.471 --> 00:05:24.493]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product.
[00:05:24.533 --> 00:05:25.113]  It's so powerful.
[00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:36.079]  This is the breakdown product after your cells process it of folic acid, methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:37.779]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:38.680]  It's not a stimulant.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.801]  It energizes your cells.
[00:05:41.241 --> 00:05:41.622]  We're good to go.
[00:06:15.783 --> 00:06:18.645]  You can face it.
[00:06:18.725 --> 00:06:20.886]  You can hear it.
[00:06:20.946 --> 00:06:25.548]  We're getting near it.
[00:06:25.688 --> 00:06:29.630]  You wanna make it.
[00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:34.093]  Cause you can take it.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.242]  It's Thursday, January 25th, 2024.
[00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:45.525]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:06:46.546 --> 00:06:49.809]  And the quickening is accelerating.
[00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:51.951]  14 states have joined with Texas.
[00:06:52.231 --> 00:06:55.414]  Many are sending their guard forces.
[00:06:56.515 --> 00:07:04.162]  Biden is now openly threatening to nationalize the state guards and basically put the republic into a form of martial law.
[00:07:05.822 --> 00:07:06.583]  We're good to go.
[00:07:06.603 --> 00:07:07.183]  We're good to go.
[00:07:32.128 --> 00:07:33.108]  You've not seen anything yet.
[00:07:33.188 --> 00:07:39.351]  The giant UN camps are being expanded all over northern South America into Central America.
[00:07:39.951 --> 00:07:41.852]  The Communist Chinese, along with the U.S.
[00:07:41.892 --> 00:07:45.613]  government, are financing this treason.
[00:07:46.573 --> 00:07:52.295]  Now, all of this dovetails in with a whole bunch of mainstream news articles.
[00:07:52.315 --> 00:07:55.216]  New York Times, Washington Post, L.A.
[00:07:55.296 --> 00:07:56.497]  Times, Yahoo!,
[00:07:58.646 --> 00:07:59.266]  We're good to go.
[00:07:59.286 --> 00:07:59.986]  We're good to go.
[00:08:26.243 --> 00:08:29.704]  The Obamas working to take Biden out of the race.
[00:08:30.124 --> 00:08:31.564]  Iraq telling him to quit.
[00:08:32.164 --> 00:08:35.045]  We're going to be getting to all of that information.
[00:08:35.085 --> 00:08:38.186]  Look, Trump won the last two presidential elections.
[00:08:38.206 --> 00:08:38.586]  We know that.
[00:08:39.746 --> 00:08:41.486]  He's now won New Hampshire three times in a row.
[00:08:41.506 --> 00:08:42.246]  Nobody's ever done that.
[00:08:43.447 --> 00:08:45.627]  And he's going to win in a landslide.
[00:08:45.667 --> 00:08:48.708]  They can't overpower that with mail-in ballots.
[00:08:48.748 --> 00:08:53.609]  They can try it with digital systems, but when you've got...
[00:08:54.628 --> 00:08:55.389]  We're good to go.
[00:09:11.226 --> 00:09:13.147]  Has played a game of chicken with Obama.
[00:09:13.748 --> 00:09:16.149]  And I'm really going to just stop referring to it as Biden.
[00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:19.171]  And Obama is a minion of the globalists, too.
[00:09:19.211 --> 00:09:22.554]  But he actually calls shots under their orders.
[00:09:22.654 --> 00:09:24.255]  But he's in command.
[00:09:24.295 --> 00:09:27.157]  Let's not... And by the way, he got elected both times.
[00:09:27.217 --> 00:09:27.957]  He was popular.
[00:09:27.997 --> 00:09:28.978]  He manipulated people.
[00:09:29.458 --> 00:09:31.180]  When people win elections, we'll be honest about it.
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:38.945]  But his job was to create division in the name of stopping division for the eventual election.
[00:09:40.316 --> 00:09:40.656]  We're good to go.
[00:10:08.402 --> 00:10:12.025]  Saying sanctuary shitties should be banned.
[00:10:12.125 --> 00:10:12.846]  Let's start with that.
[00:10:12.866 --> 00:10:18.650]  Only three people in Washington here who think we should go straight to Belgrade and arrest Milošević.
[00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:19.711]  But let's not kid each other.
[00:10:19.871 --> 00:10:20.952]  That's another club, guys.
[00:10:21.072 --> 00:10:22.793]  Go ahead and shut that down.
[00:10:22.833 --> 00:10:23.214]  It's okay.
[00:10:24.475 --> 00:10:25.015]  It's okay.
[00:10:25.035 --> 00:10:26.036]  Let's just stop for a moment.
[00:10:26.076 --> 00:10:27.197]  Let's just look at the list here.
[00:10:28.338 --> 00:10:28.658]  All right.
[00:10:29.539 --> 00:10:29.859]  It's, yeah.
[00:10:31.169 --> 00:10:31.289]  Okay.
[00:10:31.309 --> 00:10:31.869]  All right.
[00:10:32.089 --> 00:10:33.630]  So here is clip 16.
[00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:34.451]  Biden in 2007.
[00:10:34.771 --> 00:10:37.292]  Sanctuary cities should be banned.
[00:10:37.332 --> 00:10:40.234]  We'll get to the clip of him calling for World War III later.
[00:10:40.274 --> 00:10:40.514]  Go ahead.
[00:10:41.579 --> 00:10:50.608]  You allow these cities to ignore the federal law regarding the reporting of illegal immigrants and, in fact, provide sanctuary to these immigrants.
[00:10:51.088 --> 00:11:00.237]  The reason the cities ignore the federal law is the fact that there is no funding at the federal level to provide for the kind of enforcement at the federal level you need.
[00:11:00.598 --> 00:11:01.879]  Pick up the New York Times today.
[00:11:01.919 --> 00:11:04.842]  There's a city not far across the river from my state.
[00:11:05.302 --> 00:11:08.463]  Senator Biden, yes or no, would you allow the cities to ignore the federal law?
[00:11:08.483 --> 00:11:08.723]  No.
[00:11:08.743 --> 00:11:08.843]  Okay.
[00:11:35.342 --> 00:11:36.823]  But he sure as hell does now.
[00:11:37.143 --> 00:11:44.849]  Let's take a look at Boston and see how they're doing after the mayor and others said, oh, let's put them in your houses.
[00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:48.691]  Well, there's nowhere for them, so they're living at the airport.
[00:11:48.711 --> 00:11:51.473]  They're living at public schools all over the country.
[00:11:51.533 --> 00:11:52.434]  Here's that local report.
[00:11:58.578 --> 00:11:59.619]  They've been there for months.
[00:12:01.681 --> 00:12:02.201]  Camped out.
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:07.320]  Inside the airport.
[00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:12.722]  Now, we have to ask ourselves a question.
[00:12:16.984 --> 00:12:18.084]  What are we going to do about this?
[00:12:18.224 --> 00:12:35.590]  Well, first, we have to be aware that it is not the right of Texas and 14 other states to say no to a totally open border with massive human smuggling and drug dealing and fentanyl and all the rest of the insanity going on.
[00:12:37.225 --> 00:12:38.186]  It is not just our right.
[00:12:38.326 --> 00:12:41.749]  It is our duty to say no to that.
[00:12:41.909 --> 00:12:54.840]  And Governor Abbott has put out a statement that we have up on Infowars.com that I think is very, very important and that we need to read on air.
[00:12:56.121 --> 00:13:03.087]  But before I get to that statement, I want to play a clip of Abbott
[00:13:04.298 --> 00:13:06.680]  On Fox News, talking about this.
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.281]  Here he says, Here's the clip.
[00:13:23.422 --> 00:13:38.611]  What Texas is doing is just very simple, and that is because the Biden administration has really, truly abdicated its responsibility to secure the border and enforce the laws, Texas very simply is securing the border.
[00:13:39.091 --> 00:13:46.256]  And so we put up the razor wire that you were talking about, Bill, and we put up all these barricades that actually have denied illegal entry.
[00:13:46.916 --> 00:13:50.518]  And as you pointed out also in that screening, there are criminals coming across our border.
[00:13:50.898 --> 00:14:00.803]  Texas has a right as a state to stop criminals from coming into our state, to make arrests of those criminals.
[00:14:01.323 --> 00:14:07.566]  And we have National Guard as well as Texas Department of Public Safety officers who are there to make those arrests.
[00:14:08.186 --> 00:14:09.686]  And to deny illegal entry.
[00:14:10.207 --> 00:14:12.527]  And Joe Biden actually does have an option here.
[00:14:13.007 --> 00:14:18.368]  Joe Biden's option is to enforce the laws of the United States and stop this illegal entry.
[00:14:19.429 --> 00:14:34.592]  Instead, Joe Biden has come out and said through the administration, I have the article right here, that they're preparing to try to federalize the state guards, which you can do for a war or an invasion.
[00:14:34.672 --> 00:14:36.973]  But this is to nationalize them
[00:14:38.038 --> 00:14:39.559]  To aid an invasion.
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.021]  Did you hear what I just said?
[00:14:41.801 --> 00:14:42.842]  I've got the Constitution.
[00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:43.803]  I printed it off right here.
[00:14:43.863 --> 00:14:46.165]  I covered this on Monday and Tuesday.
[00:14:46.185 --> 00:14:48.767]  I read the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution on this.
[00:14:49.508 --> 00:14:50.508]  And I also read the Bill of Rights.
[00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:53.111]  Nine and ten.
[00:14:55.012 --> 00:15:01.277]  And it says in nine, none of the powers given to the federal government are taken from the states of the people.
[00:15:03.279 --> 00:15:06.822]  Particularly if the federal government doesn't engage in its duty.
[00:15:08.976 --> 00:15:15.461]  So I think it's very, very important to understand that Governor Abbott is 100% in the right here.
[00:15:16.963 --> 00:15:18.764]  And you can say what you want about Governor Abbott.
[00:15:18.824 --> 00:15:22.067]  He's not done as good a job as Trump or even DeSantis.
[00:15:22.688 --> 00:15:23.568]  And I've been a big critic.
[00:15:24.929 --> 00:15:35.678]  But when he starts moving the needle violently, I don't mean that literally, but hard in the right direction, are we going to sit here and bitch about it?
[00:15:35.979 --> 00:15:36.159]  I mean...
[00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:38.951]  That's the question.
[00:15:40.332 --> 00:15:41.772]  And you need to read his statement.
[00:15:41.792 --> 00:15:45.634]  It's posted on Infowars.com.
[00:15:47.535 --> 00:15:48.595]  But listen to this.
[00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:52.797]  Listen to this letter here, and I'm going to read this.
[00:15:53.837 --> 00:15:59.300]  The federal government, this is from Governor Greg Abbott, January 24th, this is yesterday, 2024.
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:07.003]  The federal government has broken the compact between the United States and the states.
[00:16:08.032 --> 00:16:08.612]  We're good to go.
[00:16:37.335 --> 00:16:38.595]  The governor delivered to him by hand.
[00:16:55.563 --> 00:16:55.723]  I think?
[00:17:22.705 --> 00:17:23.105]  We're good to go.
[00:17:23.225 --> 00:17:23.445]  I think?
[00:17:38.038 --> 00:17:54.069]  By wasting taxpayer dollars to tear open Texas border security infrastructure, President Biden has enticed illegal immigrants away from their 28 legal entry points along the state's southern border bridges where nobody drowns and into the dangerous waters of the Rio Grande.
[00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:57.172]  Major public safety issue right there.
[00:17:57.212 --> 00:17:58.793]  You have a duty to stop that.
[00:17:58.813 --> 00:17:59.713]  This is so reckless.
[00:18:00.634 --> 00:18:01.455]  And stop right there.
[00:18:01.495 --> 00:18:02.896]  I'm going to go back to the letter in a minute.
[00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:07.591]  By the way, great job, crew, blowing up on screen, because back when my eyes were good, I couldn't read this.
[00:18:07.611 --> 00:18:08.251]  This is so small.
[00:18:08.552 --> 00:18:11.673]  So good job thinking that, realizing I couldn't read it once you gave it to me.
[00:18:11.693 --> 00:18:18.235]  Because I had a bigger copy here earlier that was blown up, and I can't find it, so they were scrambling because they could tell I couldn't read that.
[00:18:19.035 --> 00:18:20.435]  Look, look, let me just stop here.
[00:18:21.796 --> 00:18:23.996]  There's so much to unpack just in what I just read.
[00:18:25.857 --> 00:18:26.037]  But...
[00:18:29.056 --> 00:18:38.082]  What's in the Carrie Lake audio with the head of the RNC, the head of the Republican Party in Arizona?
[00:18:39.263 --> 00:18:40.924]  She says, man, I'm really worried they're going to kill me.
[00:18:40.944 --> 00:18:44.966]  He goes, yeah, there's a lot of Mexican mafia in MS-13.
[00:18:46.688 --> 00:18:50.790]  How many times have I told you, and it's come out, that the Democrats are using MS-13...
[00:18:54.264 --> 00:18:58.654]  The Mexican mafia and other cartels to kill people they don't like.
[00:18:59.195 --> 00:19:02.764]  And that's why they're bringing them in and working with them and laundering money with them.
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:05.801]  We're good to go.
[00:19:30.584 --> 00:19:30.764]  I think?
[00:19:57.566 --> 00:19:58.526]  Guys, cue up the clip.
[00:19:58.626 --> 00:20:03.207]  Obama says we need a domestic security force just as big and just as strong as our military.
[00:20:03.587 --> 00:20:06.068]  Said it in 2007 when he was running for office.
[00:20:07.768 --> 00:20:19.731]  And they even tried to have, we have the videos, of the Obama domestic security force training where it's literal black kids, brainwashed to be racist, chanting Obama is our leader, we're going to take over America.
[00:20:21.011 --> 00:20:22.852]  Now that program he launched didn't fly.
[00:20:23.132 --> 00:20:23.852]  It's too ridiculous.
[00:20:25.114 --> 00:20:29.316]  But what I'm getting at here is this is a larger operation.
[00:20:30.897 --> 00:20:32.377]  And this is NGO run.
[00:20:35.239 --> 00:20:42.182]  From the refugee camps to flying them or shipping them from overseas to the refugee camps to directing them into the country.
[00:20:42.402 --> 00:20:44.483]  And then once they get here, they own them.
[00:20:45.043 --> 00:20:46.164]  They control them.
[00:20:47.685 --> 00:20:48.865]  And it's totally lawless.
[00:20:49.205 --> 00:20:50.306]  It's completely illegal.
[00:20:52.623 --> 00:20:59.509]  And when the Border Patrol follows their orders to be the facilitators, they are now aiding and abetting human trafficking.
[00:20:59.529 --> 00:21:00.550]  Yeah, the crew found the clip.
[00:21:00.771 --> 00:21:01.171]  Here it is.
[00:21:01.191 --> 00:21:09.339]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set.
[00:21:10.159 --> 00:21:17.206]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:21:22.984 --> 00:21:29.325]  Now, good old boys, and I love them to death, always say, the moment I... You know, they don't have to get politically involved.
[00:21:29.365 --> 00:21:30.386]  They don't have to go to the border.
[00:21:30.426 --> 00:21:31.486]  They don't have to speak out.
[00:21:31.526 --> 00:21:32.866]  They don't have to donate to political causes.
[00:21:33.486 --> 00:21:35.887]  They just got a whole bunch of guns on their ranch.
[00:21:36.927 --> 00:21:39.067]  Boy, will we ever see you in blue helmets.
[00:21:39.087 --> 00:21:40.668]  That's the end of the world for them.
[00:21:41.228 --> 00:21:42.468]  Well, they're not going to send blue helmets.
[00:21:43.168 --> 00:21:43.948]  At least not at this point.
[00:21:44.489 --> 00:21:46.289]  Once the Civil War goes on for a few years, they will.
[00:21:46.329 --> 00:21:46.949]  That's official.
[00:21:46.969 --> 00:21:47.809]  7277, look it up.
[00:21:47.829 --> 00:21:49.870]  State Department of Random, 7277 and others.
[00:21:52.332 --> 00:21:53.793]  That's not the first wave.
[00:21:54.594 --> 00:22:03.180]  Cut off the energy, dissolve the borders, defund the police, massive crime, devalue the currency, create a race war, demoralize the nation.
[00:22:04.761 --> 00:22:06.042]  So people laughed at Obama.
[00:22:06.282 --> 00:22:10.065]  Oh, yeah, you're going to create a domestic security force just as big and just as strong as our military.
[00:22:10.585 --> 00:22:12.166]  What are all the big blue cities doing?
[00:22:12.626 --> 00:22:17.390]  Some of them have cut police by half, and then they hire huge social worker NGOs.
[00:22:18.729 --> 00:22:20.110]  People go, well, they're not going to stop crime.
[00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:21.010]  They're not meant to.
[00:22:21.371 --> 00:22:28.595]  They go out and organize the crime and farm the illegals and the homeless and send tens of billions back to the Democratic Party.
[00:22:29.735 --> 00:22:31.536]  So people sit back and laugh at the Democrats.
[00:22:31.736 --> 00:22:33.097]  Oh, they're a bunch of idiots.
[00:22:33.237 --> 00:22:33.898]  No, they're not.
[00:22:34.178 --> 00:22:35.539]  This is well thought out.
[00:22:35.839 --> 00:22:37.220]  This is well coordinated.
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:38.480]  This is well planned.
[00:22:38.921 --> 00:22:44.504]  And I sit there and I watch Congress have hearings about how do we stop illegal aliens and no discussion how Congress...
[00:22:47.788 --> 00:22:56.750]  Is still funding 80% on average of the funds for the refugee camps, for the migrant camps, to ship them into our hemisphere and bring them in here.
[00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:01.410]  And I know General Lester's like, God, Alex, you say that every hour, every day.
[00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:02.051]  We know that.
[00:23:02.311 --> 00:23:05.251]  Well, the Congress doesn't know it, and the public doesn't know it.
[00:23:05.431 --> 00:23:06.611]  I understand you know that.
[00:23:06.991 --> 00:23:07.692]  I know it, too.
[00:23:13.193 --> 00:23:15.693]  So that's where we are.
[00:23:17.541 --> 00:23:22.689]  And think of the genius of an NGO, of a community organizer.
[00:23:22.709 --> 00:23:23.830]  That's what Obama is.
[00:23:25.693 --> 00:23:29.919]  And they cut off the police, they cut off the food, they cut off the energy, they cut off the infrastructure, but don't worry...
[00:23:30.851 --> 00:23:43.319]  There's these federal programs that'll get you your food and your medicine, but you've got to be politically in their group and radicalized and mobilized, and that's what they're doing with the illegal aliens and all these other groups.
[00:23:44.079 --> 00:23:48.302]  So this is a well-thought-out, long-term, strategic plan.
[00:23:49.823 --> 00:23:51.744]  Let's go back, put it back on screen, please, where we were.
[00:23:51.824 --> 00:23:54.506]  Great job with the letter from the governor.
[00:23:55.728 --> 00:24:04.014]  President Biden's lawless border policies, where the 6 million illegal immigrants have crossed over, it's 10 million plus, in just three years.
[00:24:04.475 --> 00:24:08.138]  This is more than the population of 33 different states in the country.
[00:24:08.978 --> 00:24:20.147]  This illegal refusal to protect the state has inflicted unprecedented harm on the people across the United States.
[00:24:23.666 --> 00:24:24.387]  We're good to go.
[00:24:40.908 --> 00:25:00.858]  This is why the framers included both Article 4, Section 4, which promises that the federal government shall protect each state against invasion, and Article 1, Subsection 10, Clause 3, which acknowledges the state's sovereign interest in protecting the borders, Arizona versus United States, 567 U.S.
[00:25:00.898 --> 00:25:01.558]  387, 419, 2012, Scalia J. dissenting.
[00:25:10.054 --> 00:25:10.335]  I think.
[00:25:19.298 --> 00:25:19.918]  We're good to go.
[00:25:20.018 --> 00:25:20.699]  We're good to go.
[00:25:20.719 --> 00:25:21.439]  We're good to go.
[00:25:49.335 --> 00:25:51.219]  Bravo, Greg Abbott, baby.
[00:25:51.259 --> 00:25:54.345]  That's the shot heard around the world right there.
[00:25:54.365 --> 00:25:57.992]  And I've told people this 5,000 times and I'll say it again.
[00:25:59.451 --> 00:26:00.111]  We're good to go.
[00:26:30.336 --> 00:26:37.760]  With these tens of millions of people to be organized into a permanent political voting bloc and political action bloc and a violent bloc.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.321]  And what did the head of the Republican Party threaten Carrie Lake with?
[00:26:41.642 --> 00:26:43.002]  She said, I think they're going to kill me.
[00:26:43.282 --> 00:26:43.943]  I've been getting threats.
[00:26:43.963 --> 00:26:47.344]  She says, yeah, yeah, the cartels will kill you.
[00:26:48.125 --> 00:26:50.286]  Who do you think the cartels work for, boys and girls?
[00:26:55.728 --> 00:26:58.549]  That's why the CIA's been down there going after them to make sure they're under their control.
[00:26:58.869 --> 00:27:00.530]  And they can use them as plausible liability.
[00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:09.014]  And then some scumbag in prison gives an order over the phone to one of his captains in code to go out and kill a certain person and he doesn't even know who gave him the order.
[00:27:11.755 --> 00:27:13.996]  So they're geared up for something really big.
[00:27:14.056 --> 00:27:16.157]  And you've already seen all the crazy crap they've pulled.
[00:27:19.028 --> 00:27:21.049]  So we're on the edge of history right here.
[00:27:21.489 --> 00:27:28.811]  If you think things are crazy right now, if you think history's happening now, it's just going to get wilder and crazier from here on out.
[00:27:29.071 --> 00:27:30.872]  But at least people know what's going on.
[00:27:31.192 --> 00:27:37.014]  And now 14 states have signed on, and a bunch of the states are sending their National Guard down here.
[00:27:37.314 --> 00:27:39.335]  And will they stop at all, or will it be perfect?
[00:27:39.375 --> 00:27:42.135]  But no, at least we're drawing attention to it.
[00:27:42.396 --> 00:27:46.397]  And the governor is creating a constitutional crisis where he knows he's in the right
[00:27:46.997 --> 00:28:06.487]  To get all the support across the country, and to spotlight that Biden is now, oh Biden, talking about nationalizing the State Guard, which he can only do to stop invasion, so that it'll facilitate an invasion, and then in comes the Supreme Court, and yeah, are they getting blackmailed at a certain level?
[00:28:06.507 --> 00:28:07.067]  We know they are.
[00:28:07.348 --> 00:28:09.589]  But if they see everything shifting our way...
[00:28:11.661 --> 00:28:12.482]  We're good to go.
[00:28:36.081 --> 00:28:36.361]  All right?
[00:28:36.401 --> 00:28:41.583]  I mean, their bold breaking of the border is a big deal and should be easy to stop.
[00:28:42.244 --> 00:28:49.647]  And what Abbott has done, triggering this response by Biden, is the right move and is really smart, and we need to support it.
[00:28:50.507 --> 00:28:51.527]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:51.587 --> 00:28:51.988]  Stay with us.
[00:28:52.088 --> 00:28:53.188]  InfoWars.com.
[00:28:53.428 --> 00:28:54.469]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:28:59.881 --> 00:29:04.007]  You know, I sit up here and I yell and scream about the New World Order and the globalists.
[00:29:04.027 --> 00:29:08.132]  They're planning to get rid of the borders and release a virus and have a global power grab.
[00:29:08.172 --> 00:29:09.213]  And you saw it all come true.
[00:29:10.335 --> 00:29:11.056]  But there's a...
[00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.971]  We're good to go.

[00:29:59.358 --> 00:30:00.960]  I'm not on Team NFL.
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:02.741]  I'm not on Team NBA.
[00:30:02.942 --> 00:30:03.903]  I'm not on Team Olympics.
[00:30:04.203 --> 00:30:07.626]  I'm not on Team Globalist or Wokeism in the New World Order.
[00:30:07.867 --> 00:30:18.117]  I'm on Team Humanity, ladies and gentlemen, that loves God and loves our families and loves humanity and knows that we're destined to do even more incredible things than we've already done together.
[00:30:18.277 --> 00:30:21.961]  And so, inspired by my conversation with Elon Musk recently...
[00:30:22.321 --> 00:30:22.921]  We're good to go.
[00:30:39.392 --> 00:30:43.553]  Get your limited edition Team Humanity t-shirts right now at InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you.
[00:30:59.699 --> 00:31:09.186]  Media matters, the Democratic Party, MSNBC and others have asked me to apologize for making a parody video game, criticizing the deep state and all the corruption.
[00:31:09.846 --> 00:31:11.628]  And to all them, I just want to say this.
[00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:13.730]  Go f*** yourselves.
[00:31:15.491 --> 00:31:21.817]  Alex Jones New World Order Wars has been number one on Steam thanks to the viewers and listeners of this broadcast.
[00:31:22.157 --> 00:31:35.368]  And I want to invite everyone, before they are successful at banning, which I hope they aren't, to go to AlexJonesGame.com and follow the link to Steam and download this game for $17.76 as a message to the New World Order.
[00:31:35.788 --> 00:31:36.528]  F*** you!
[00:31:37.089 --> 00:31:45.092]  You want to try to ban this game just like you want to steal elections and force injections on us and open up our borders and rape us.
[00:31:45.512 --> 00:31:49.473]  This is a culture war and they're scared of this game.
[00:31:49.913 --> 00:31:58.637]  Get Alex Jones New World Order Wars right now at AlexJonesGame.com because anything badass gets censored!
[00:31:59.656 --> 00:32:03.378]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[00:32:03.718 --> 00:32:06.880]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[00:32:07.281 --> 00:32:11.743]  Because they can't get through this giant megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[00:32:12.384 --> 00:32:14.505]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[00:32:14.825 --> 00:32:22.790]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's You Will Eat the Bugs.
[00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:24.731]  This is The Great Awakening.
[00:32:25.211 --> 00:32:25.952]  We're good to go.
[00:32:26.032 --> 00:32:26.673]  We're good to go.
[00:32:40.029 --> 00:32:40.709]  We're good to go.
[00:32:41.009 --> 00:32:41.829]  We're good to go.
[00:33:12.032 --> 00:33:14.874]  We're good to go.
[00:33:14.914 --> 00:33:17.375]  We're good to go.
[00:33:41.514 --> 00:33:46.899]  Alright, we got a guest coming on for 30 minutes at the start of the next hour.
[00:33:46.919 --> 00:33:50.061]  Then I'm going to take a call for at least an hour and a half.
[00:33:50.141 --> 00:33:53.864]  Open phones coming up in about an hour from now, or just an hour from now.
[00:33:56.767 --> 00:33:59.789]  But I want to say something here, and I really want this to sink in to everybody, okay?
[00:34:01.711 --> 00:34:08.116]  We sit here and we look at this bold New World Order takeover and all of this crazy, over-the-top criminal activity by the government.
[00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:12.421]  And we say, why are they doing this?
[00:34:12.661 --> 00:34:14.082]  Why is it so reckless?
[00:34:14.583 --> 00:34:21.007]  Why would they destroy such a powerful, rich country that already has given the globalists that hijacked the country the biggest military in the world?
[00:34:21.208 --> 00:34:25.471]  Our military is bigger than all the militaries combined in the world, hardware-wise.
[00:34:27.162 --> 00:34:27.482]  Why?
[00:34:27.942 --> 00:34:30.803]  Because it has to fall to bring in the world government.
[00:34:30.843 --> 00:34:39.647]  You can't have people with prosperity and freedom and owning guns and raising their children the way they want and going to church the way they want with this system they've got.
[00:34:39.907 --> 00:34:41.547]  We have to go down.
[00:34:41.627 --> 00:34:49.330]  And the UN and the Club of Rome and the CFR and the Trilateral Commission and the WEF, they're all on record saying it.
[00:34:51.251 --> 00:34:52.711]  And finally people are getting this.
[00:34:52.811 --> 00:34:53.712]  I see it everywhere.
[00:34:53.952 --> 00:34:54.552]  Not even looking.
[00:34:55.930 --> 00:34:57.430]  People say, Jones taught us how to do it.
[00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:58.571]  Well, I don't know why I taught you.
[00:34:59.311 --> 00:35:01.752]  I learned from a lot of really smart patriots.
[00:35:03.252 --> 00:35:04.592]  You just go to their own documents.
[00:35:04.652 --> 00:35:05.393]  It's all right there.
[00:35:05.493 --> 00:35:08.914]  And yeah, I was particularly blessed that I had super-informed family.
[00:35:09.154 --> 00:35:23.538]  And that right when I got on air, in 1994, that within a year of being on air, I got to meet all these incredible OGs, the General Partons, the Ted Gundersons, the...
[00:35:24.468 --> 00:35:27.330]  The Aaron Russos, the all of them.
[00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:28.030]  The Ron Pauls.
[00:35:30.312 --> 00:35:31.232]  The G. Edward Griffiths.
[00:35:33.134 --> 00:35:34.534]  And that's how I know all this.
[00:35:36.656 --> 00:35:47.643]  Because that's what I decided to do was worry about powerful megacorporations that already controlled most of the world 30 years ago planning a horrible plan.
[00:35:50.385 --> 00:35:53.607]  I did a review today that's going to air tomorrow on the Mug Club.
[00:35:54.687 --> 00:35:58.448]  For people that sign up at jonescrotter.com, a review of Demolition Man, made in 1993.
[00:36:00.848 --> 00:36:05.909]  And you watch that movie, and beef's banned, and the family's banned, and virtual reality runs your life.
[00:36:05.949 --> 00:36:07.609]  You say, how did they predict this?
[00:36:08.029 --> 00:36:10.650]  Because they're telling you what they were going to build.
[00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:16.391]  They're throwing it in your face, people.
[00:36:18.131 --> 00:36:20.591]  And you don't have to go along with it.
[00:36:20.912 --> 00:36:23.212]  If you simply do not comply, it will fail.
[00:36:24.414 --> 00:36:24.974]  We're good to go.
[00:36:54.502 --> 00:36:59.663]  The bad news is they've got unlimited fiat money to pay you to do it.
[00:37:01.403 --> 00:37:11.845]  So I've got a lot of other news to hit here and a lot to cover ahead of this guest that went down with Brett Weinstein and Michael Yan to the Darien Gap.
[00:37:11.865 --> 00:37:13.085]  He just got back a few days ago.
[00:37:13.105 --> 00:37:15.286]  I'll tell you about the guest when he joins us.
[00:37:15.646 --> 00:37:21.407]  He's just popping in to give his engineering expertise and science expertise on what he saw and what he thinks.
[00:37:22.087 --> 00:37:23.287]  Yan recommends him, so we're getting him on.
[00:37:25.794 --> 00:37:27.314]  But I just want people to understand.
[00:37:27.334 --> 00:37:29.735]  That's Chris Martinson.
[00:37:31.015 --> 00:37:34.176]  I just want everybody to understand that you are living in an epic time.
[00:37:35.136 --> 00:37:38.377]  And everything we were warned about for decades and decades and decades is now here.
[00:37:39.977 --> 00:37:42.157]  And I'm going to say this again.
[00:37:45.418 --> 00:37:47.339]  There are thousands of different political movements.
[00:37:47.359 --> 00:37:49.059]  There's all these different flavors of BS.
[00:37:49.939 --> 00:37:54.080]  This show studies the actual controllers and their plans.
[00:37:55.376 --> 00:37:57.497]  And this whole broadcast is about believing in you.
[00:38:20.842 --> 00:38:28.089]  So, I knew when Governor Abbott went down there and blocked illegals at one entry point coming in, that the feds would take the bait and come try to block it.
[00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:39.420]  But the Border Patrol has refused to get in a physical confrontation with the Texas Guard, and now Abbott is blocking off more areas at the border, and now 14 states have joined him, and now seven states are sending troops.
[00:38:40.901 --> 00:38:44.285]  Do you realize the history you're living in right now?
[00:38:46.001 --> 00:38:51.405]  This isn't some movie about the states joining up against the feds like they have coming out next month.
[00:38:54.627 --> 00:38:58.450]  Or all the other TV shows promoting it and branding it as racist and evil and bad.
[00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:02.353]  This is happening under the Constitution and is real and is good.
[00:39:07.497 --> 00:39:09.879]  And will Governor Abbott's operation save us?
[00:39:10.039 --> 00:39:10.259]  No.
[00:39:10.379 --> 00:39:12.941]  But all of this resistance together will.
[00:39:12.981 --> 00:39:14.342]  And this isn't a tiny cut
[00:39:15.686 --> 00:39:16.467]  Against the New World Order.
[00:39:16.487 --> 00:39:17.327]  This is a big one.
[00:39:17.988 --> 00:39:26.994]  And the fact that all these states piled on now and are sending troops is massively positive.
[00:39:27.034 --> 00:39:27.774]  Now, here's the problem.
[00:39:29.075 --> 00:39:35.440]  If I was the New World Order, if I was the devil, as Paul Harvey would say, what would you do right now?
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:41.344]  You'd be activating a group of drugged out wackos.
[00:39:41.364 --> 00:39:43.185]  They've been funding and controlling for years.
[00:39:43.205 --> 00:39:44.006]  You know, they've got a bunch of them.
[00:39:45.572 --> 00:39:48.413]  To go set off a truck bomb at a migrant center on the border.
[00:39:49.614 --> 00:39:50.494]  Or a mass shooting.
[00:39:52.015 --> 00:39:55.296]  Or maybe they assassinate Biden because he's refusing to step down.
[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:05.521]  My mother never gets involved in politics.
[00:40:07.221 --> 00:40:12.704]  She's a Christian historian and really smart person and she's just very private.
[00:40:13.564 --> 00:40:14.905]  But my mother for three years
[00:40:17.153 --> 00:40:25.035]  Has told me they're going to assassinate Biden to bring in martial law because the spirit has told her.
[00:40:26.956 --> 00:40:29.177]  And she's been very, very direct about it.
[00:40:31.337 --> 00:40:34.578]  And my mother is dialed in and does have the touch.
[00:40:35.939 --> 00:40:39.620]  But you can politically see all this and know that's in the cards.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.781]  Especially now because Biden's refusing to step down.
[00:40:46.007 --> 00:40:47.908]  And my mother is extremely psychic.
[00:41:15.714 --> 00:41:16.975]  And let's just say I got a little of that.
[00:41:17.635 --> 00:41:18.795]  But I don't just need that.
[00:41:18.815 --> 00:41:24.018]  I can politically see it all, and then the Holy Spirit's what it is, tells you the rest of what's going to happen.
[00:41:24.578 --> 00:41:34.063]  But she has had dreams and has been upset for three years, has grabbed me by the arm and said, you got to tell them they're going to kill Biden right before the election.
[00:41:37.604 --> 00:41:38.445]  So I told you the story.
[00:41:39.065 --> 00:41:39.425]  It's true.
[00:41:40.306 --> 00:41:43.027]  Now, that doesn't mean that's going to happen because we can change that.
[00:41:43.769 --> 00:41:47.752]  But I read the New York Times and the Washington Post and all of them.
[00:41:47.772 --> 00:41:50.974]  There's a boil down right here in Red State.
[00:41:51.014 --> 00:41:52.255]  They're telling him to step down.
[00:41:52.275 --> 00:41:54.136]  And we told you months ago from our sources that was happening.
[00:41:54.396 --> 00:41:55.277]  Now it's mainstream news.
[00:41:55.537 --> 00:41:56.838]  And he's saying, no, I'm the president.
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:03.242]  Because they want to get Big Mike ready to put in there.
[00:42:03.322 --> 00:42:06.804]  What's going to happen when they kill Biden and blame it on us?
[00:42:07.244 --> 00:42:08.245]  What are we going to do?
[00:42:10.166 --> 00:42:10.567]  Report.
[00:42:10.587 --> 00:42:12.308]  The Obama's working to take Biden out.
[00:42:13.951 --> 00:42:14.471]  Of the race.
[00:42:14.872 --> 00:42:16.173]  Barack telling him to quit.
[00:42:16.193 --> 00:42:26.520]  There have been multiple reports about Barack Obama and his aides being worried about how Biden and his team are conducting their campaign.
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:33.425]  Obama has supposedly so worried about the strength of Donald Trump and the Biden campaign wasn't hitting the ground running.
[00:42:34.145 --> 00:42:37.668]  Obama aides put a sharper point to that.
[00:42:37.688 --> 00:42:38.889]  It just goes on to say that
[00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:44.873]  Obama has met with him multiple times and told him to resign, to step down now.
[00:42:44.953 --> 00:42:46.754]  Not even ahead of a DNC.
[00:42:47.534 --> 00:42:50.776]  So we'll talk about it all when we come up in the next segment.
[00:42:51.416 --> 00:42:53.478]  And we're going to open the phones up after this guest leaves us.
[00:42:53.498 --> 00:42:53.878]  Stay with us.
[00:42:59.181 --> 00:43:01.423]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[00:43:01.603 --> 00:43:01.943]  Thank you.
[00:43:02.143 --> 00:43:04.685]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[00:43:04.765 --> 00:43:06.026]  I started taking that stuff.
[00:43:06.086 --> 00:43:09.129]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[00:43:09.149 --> 00:43:10.270]  When did you start taking it?
[00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:14.313]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure, and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[00:43:14.333 --> 00:43:14.473]  Mm-hmm.
[00:43:15.113 --> 00:43:15.254]  Mm-hmm.
[00:43:15.274 --> 00:43:15.394]  Mm-hmm.
[00:43:31.494 --> 00:43:45.368]  And even though I do think all your other products are good, I recommend to anybody that they start with X2 iodine because it detoxifies your body and kind of kicks your natural DNA into full force.
[00:43:45.468 --> 00:43:48.951]  So in my life, I found X2 iodine the best.
[00:43:49.412 --> 00:43:52.855]  I tried other iodines and they didn't have the same effect.
[00:43:53.155 --> 00:43:55.457]  So X2 iodine, I really wanted to point that out.
[00:43:59.983 --> 00:44:02.904]  Have you tried taking the real red pill?
[00:44:03.104 --> 00:44:08.945]  A one-of-a-kind heart and brain formula designed exclusively for InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:44:09.125 --> 00:44:13.786]  One of the most powerful ingredients in real red pill plus is pregnenolone.
[00:44:14.026 --> 00:44:21.968]  Pregnenolone levels decrease with age, and low levels are associated with fatigue, low brain function, and unhealthy aging.
[00:44:22.188 --> 00:44:30.134]  The Real Red Pill Plus also provides essential trace minerals such as vitamin B12, calcium, copper, and zinc.
[00:44:30.354 --> 00:44:43.304]  Featuring naturally occurring L-theanine, caffeine, and theobromine, the energy blend inside the Real Red Pill Plus provides an extra pick-me-up for your day that goes beyond the second cup of coffee.
[00:44:43.604 --> 00:44:50.488]  So visit Infowarsstore.com, go down the rabbit hole, and try taking the real red pill.
[00:44:50.729 --> 00:44:55.251]  Now 25% off for a limited time at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:44:59.119 --> 00:45:03.241]  InfoWarsStore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.

[00:45:05.802 --> 00:45:07.562]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[00:45:07.822 --> 00:45:10.063]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[00:45:10.303 --> 00:45:11.024]  Hey, what's better?
[00:45:11.124 --> 00:45:11.624]  Knockout?
[00:45:11.984 --> 00:45:12.544]  What's better?
[00:45:13.325 --> 00:45:13.785]  Down and out?
[00:45:14.065 --> 00:45:14.525]  What's better?
[00:45:14.585 --> 00:45:16.186]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[00:45:16.866 --> 00:45:21.788]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[00:45:22.483 --> 00:45:26.087]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[00:45:26.448 --> 00:45:27.769]  That's how our bodies work.
[00:45:27.789 --> 00:45:28.710]  They're all very diverse.
[00:45:29.091 --> 00:45:39.282]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night Sleep.
[00:45:40.003 --> 00:45:45.449]  This is a great formula full of amazing safe compounds, giving you deeper, cleaner, restful sleep.

[00:46:37.155 --> 00:46:44.762]  People have reported a reduction in symptoms of insomnia, arthritis, seizures, chronic pain, and epilepsy.
[00:46:45.262 --> 00:46:51.888]  Several studies have shown it helps to reduce cortisol, increase serotonin, and boost vitality.

[00:47:01.437 --> 00:47:07.362]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:39.818 --> 00:47:42.504]  Alright, I've got more news I want to hit here.
[00:47:42.524 --> 00:47:45.851]  There's going to be so much after the special guest leaves in about 40 minutes.
[00:47:45.891 --> 00:47:46.733]  He joins us in 10 minutes.
[00:47:46.753 --> 00:47:47.935]  I've opened the phones up.
[00:47:47.956 --> 00:47:49.759]  It's the last hour and a half here.
[00:47:51.971 --> 00:47:54.993]  But before I go any further, this is very simple.
[00:47:55.473 --> 00:47:57.255]  I can't take on the New World Order without you.
[00:47:57.655 --> 00:48:02.538]  So I try to bring you really amazing products that are going to work really well so you want to get them over and over again.
[00:48:02.998 --> 00:48:06.060]  And almost everybody that orders the products orders them over and over again.
[00:48:06.521 --> 00:48:12.525]  The problem is less than 1% of our audience, it's way less than that, it's like less than half a percent, ever go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:48:12.965 --> 00:48:16.287]  So you're watching on X right now or you're on a radio station driving along.
[00:48:16.888 --> 00:48:18.489]  Okay, somebody else is selling something.
[00:48:18.809 --> 00:48:20.650]  No, I'm not just somebody selling something.
[00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:21.691]  I think we've proven that, okay?
[00:48:22.791 --> 00:48:25.312]  I mean, just take it, drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:48:25.853 --> 00:48:28.674]  All the great supplements they've got there that aren't available at InfoWorks.com.

[00:48:41.779 --> 00:48:44.680]  That's available again at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:48:46.592 --> 00:48:51.257]  And drjonesnaturals.com is a great sponsor and what funds this operation.
[00:48:51.297 --> 00:48:58.724]  It's not just that silver product, so many other products, dozens of products, not available at infowarsstore.com or available at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:49:00.273 --> 00:49:00.834]  Just one word.
[00:49:00.894 --> 00:49:02.875]  drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:49:03.235 --> 00:49:05.596]  drjonesnaturals.com.

[00:50:11.018 --> 00:50:11.218]  Okay?
[00:50:34.844 --> 00:50:37.345]  The average person will do just fine, but it's not powerful.
[00:50:37.605 --> 00:50:38.226]  I'll be point blank.
[00:50:38.246 --> 00:50:50.031]  I mean, if I'm super tired, and I've already been working 10 hours, and coffee's not going to work, or I don't want to be up 10 hours, so I don't want to take terrible force, I take this product.

[00:51:12.288 --> 00:51:12.428]  Now,
[00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:15.511]  I think we're good to go.
[00:51:34.622 --> 00:51:35.763]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:51:35.843 --> 00:51:37.964]  It is so awesome to see.
[00:51:38.024 --> 00:51:40.266]  Tucker Carlson is a super patriot rock star.
[00:51:40.947 --> 00:51:42.047]  He says it's genocide.
[00:51:42.127 --> 00:51:47.811]  Tucker slams Canada's assisted suicide program for targeting people whose ancestors built the country.
[00:51:47.851 --> 00:51:52.815]  Well, they do it to people that are wards of the state that don't want to die.
[00:51:53.275 --> 00:51:54.796]  So that's all coming up.
[00:51:54.836 --> 00:51:55.997]  Talk about dystopic.
[00:51:56.097 --> 00:51:57.098]  This is it.
[00:51:59.016 --> 00:52:08.999]  Also, DOJ, under Biden's six-month prison sentence for a Trump advisor who defied J6 committee subpoena, just like Hunter, but he's not going to get in trouble.
[00:52:09.599 --> 00:52:16.842]  Also, DOJ, quietly it's now come out, prosecuted the COVID resistance nurses and doctors and others that told the truth.
[00:52:17.142 --> 00:52:18.662]  Many of them got criminally charged.
[00:52:18.982 --> 00:52:19.663]  That's come out.
[00:52:19.743 --> 00:52:23.084]  Big Brownstone Institute report at InfoWars.com.
[00:52:24.184 --> 00:52:37.568]  Then we've got the latest on Carrie Lake and the head of the Republican Party in Arizona resigning after he bribed her and basically threatened her with the cartel operations.
[00:52:38.229 --> 00:52:39.589]  That is coming up.
[00:52:40.349 --> 00:52:41.610]  Then I've got a bunch of crime news.
[00:52:42.659 --> 00:52:43.260]  We're good to go.
[00:53:01.385 --> 00:53:12.731]  Criminals come in and rob and they pass laws in California and in the cities that you can't arrest somebody for stealing under $2,000 to $5,000 depending on the jurisdiction.
[00:53:12.811 --> 00:53:14.152]  What's that designed to do?
[00:53:14.592 --> 00:53:21.496]  Well, the feds have announced they're building government grocery stores in Chicago and about to build them in San Francisco.
[00:53:21.936 --> 00:53:25.358]  It's about annihilating prosperity so they have money.
[00:53:26.707 --> 00:53:27.427]  We're good to go.
[00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:45.493]  This is absolute deindustrialization, and this is just the beginning of these criminal activities they're engaged in.
[00:53:46.093 --> 00:53:56.557]  Also, Germany has announced, the UK has announced, in the last 24 hours, that they're preparing to bring back their selective services and prepare for a draft with a long war with Russia.
[00:53:56.977 --> 00:54:02.279]  And they say their political plan to keep control, France said this last week, their defense minister...
[00:54:03.857 --> 00:54:05.278]  Is total war.
[00:54:06.058 --> 00:54:07.039]  That's all coming up.
[00:54:07.399 --> 00:54:10.661]  All right, I'm going to start the next hour here in a few minutes.
[00:54:11.702 --> 00:54:13.663]  But again, we're in a culture war.
[00:54:14.083 --> 00:54:16.905]  I want to encourage everybody to understand we need funds to prosecute this.
[00:54:17.385 --> 00:54:19.566]  Plus, we want to give you great products at the same time.
[00:54:20.026 --> 00:54:21.507]  Go to alexjonesgame.com.
[00:54:21.887 --> 00:54:23.748]  It went to number one on Steam but then dropped off.
[00:54:23.789 --> 00:54:26.530]  If we keep it there, it is going to fund so much of what we're doing.
[00:54:26.570 --> 00:54:27.371]  It's a fun game.
[00:54:27.631 --> 00:54:28.551]  It's politically incorrect.
[00:54:28.591 --> 00:54:29.652]  The left's trying to ban it.
[00:54:30.899 --> 00:54:35.263]  MSNBC, CNN, Media Matters, they all, George Soros wants it banned.
[00:54:35.724 --> 00:54:43.331]  Here is a quick breakdown of why they want it banned, and then we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with our number two, totally jam-packed.
[00:54:43.631 --> 00:54:44.472]  Please stay with us.
[00:54:47.410 --> 00:54:52.172]  Two years ago, we began developing this game that came out so much better than you thought it would.
[00:54:52.433 --> 00:54:53.413]  It's now a number one hit.
[00:54:53.853 --> 00:54:57.295]  I imagine the control freak left attacking it.
[00:54:57.835 --> 00:55:10.922]  But I didn't know that right when the game came out, with perfect timing, Elon Musk would release me on X. And the whole world will be waking up, and the Davos group will be confronted at their own events by world leaders calling out their tyranny.
[00:55:11.302 --> 00:55:12.763]  This is the planets aligning.
[00:55:13.123 --> 00:55:13.483]  And now...
[00:55:14.023 --> 00:55:19.905]  MSNBC, the corporate press, Media Matters, George Soros, they're all calling for it to be banned.
[00:55:20.165 --> 00:55:29.328]  Is there a way to counter the types of hate that people like Alex Jones promote and now they do in video games?
[00:55:29.348 --> 00:55:34.689]  I mean, this is a party that talks about video games being dangerous for our kids.
[00:55:34.949 --> 00:55:39.190]  And yet here he is with a video game that promotes violence.
[00:55:39.751 --> 00:55:40.611]  You will be silenced.
[00:55:42.132 --> 00:55:44.233]  And celebrates that kind of violence.
[00:55:45.494 --> 00:55:47.696]  You suck, big tech lizard nerd!
[00:55:47.936 --> 00:55:56.103]  Because let's be honest here, when he is talking about killing globalists, we know what globalists now means for the Republican Party and what that is code for.
[00:55:56.443 --> 00:56:01.948]  Because they understand they're reaching a bunch of young guys who are getting this sort of message beaten into them right now.
[00:56:02.248 --> 00:56:04.910]  Today, I'm playing the unhinged Alex Jones video game.
[00:56:05.310 --> 00:56:09.093]  I saw it was released on Steam, so I'm like, well, that kind of opens the floodgates.
[00:56:09.374 --> 00:56:10.815]  This game is actually really good fun.
[00:56:11.355 --> 00:56:12.656]  This is insane!
[00:56:13.177 --> 00:56:14.478]  Look at all the blood!
[00:56:14.498 --> 00:56:16.219]  Look at all these zombies!
[00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:17.300]  Okay.
[00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:18.301]  I'll eat your ass!
[00:56:18.401 --> 00:56:20.423]  Okay, so that is what he said.
[00:56:21.064 --> 00:56:21.904]  I'll eat your ass!
[00:56:26.428 --> 00:56:32.914]  I don't know what the characteristics of the game are beyond that he's involved and that it's killing globalists.
[00:56:33.394 --> 00:56:42.622]  This is the kind of thing that will become a normalization lever in teaching people, it's okay to kill the globalists.
[00:56:42.642 --> 00:56:43.663]  This is pretty amazing.
[00:56:44.724 --> 00:56:46.966]  Alex Jones, you are a hero.
[00:56:53.197 --> 00:56:54.980]  This is supposed to be Justin Trudeau, I think.
[00:56:55.661 --> 00:56:57.144]  Come on, Mark!
[00:56:57.885 --> 00:56:58.907]  Oh, s***!
[00:56:59.768 --> 00:57:01.311]  Mark Zuckerberg, kill me!
[00:57:01.331 --> 00:57:02.433]  Look at him crawling away.
[00:57:03.014 --> 00:57:03.275]  Wait!
[00:57:04.497 --> 00:57:05.298]  What them dogs gonna do?
[00:57:05.318 --> 00:57:05.578]  They gonna...
[00:57:07.372 --> 00:57:08.292]  Oh, they ate his ass.
[00:57:08.592 --> 00:57:11.513]  Find out what they're scared of at alexjonesgame.com.
[00:57:11.753 --> 00:57:15.294]  Follow the link from there to Steam and download it and share it.
[00:57:15.534 --> 00:57:16.135]  It's $17.76.
[00:57:16.295 --> 00:57:18.095]  It funds the info war.
[00:57:18.435 --> 00:57:19.876]  It is key in the culture war.
[00:57:20.156 --> 00:57:26.918]  We need to be engaged and involved in books and films and universities and Hollywood and everywhere.
[00:57:27.158 --> 00:57:28.098]  And we are.
[00:57:28.398 --> 00:57:33.000]  So get Alex Jones New Old Order Wars right now before they ban it.
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:37.041]  Make it such a big hit they continue to sh** their f**k.
[00:57:37.621 --> 00:57:42.244]  I want to echo what Elon Musk said to your censorship.
[00:57:42.545 --> 00:57:44.005]  Go f*** yourself!
[00:58:07.421 --> 00:58:08.202]  We're good to go.
[00:58:26.124 --> 00:58:27.365]  In our victory against these tyrants.
[00:58:27.645 --> 00:58:29.207]  But now is the time to make the decision.
[00:58:29.767 --> 00:58:34.551]  I know there's millions of forms of media out there and all this BS, and the globalists hope you get lost in all of it.
[00:58:34.931 --> 00:58:39.515]  But notice the globalists, the New World Order, are coming after us because they realize we've got their number.
[00:58:40.456 --> 00:58:40.916]  Think about it.
[00:58:41.276 --> 00:58:42.577]  Infowars is the tip of the spear.
[00:58:42.597 --> 00:58:46.080]  If you want to support the tip of the spear, that decision is up to you.
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:47.882]  Please support us now at Infowars.com.
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:55.805]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the globalist agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[00:58:57.231 --> 00:59:01.695]  It is so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives oblivious.
[00:59:01.755 --> 00:59:05.719]  And you realize ignorance is not bliss, it equals death.
[00:59:20.936 --> 00:59:41.365]  But people are starting to really understand how serious things are, and that's a hard thing to do, because to wake up to a disturbing reality and realize that we're in the middle of a giant biological weapons war against humanity, and that there's mass sterilization that's already taking place, cutting off all the major energy sources, is really hard to deal with, but it's the reality.
[00:59:41.925 --> 00:59:46.107]  Facing it is our only chance to turn this around, because stuff's about to get really, really nasty.
[00:59:46.508 --> 00:59:47.148]  Infowars.com.
[00:59:51.078 --> 00:59:57.019]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:12.722 --> 01:00:18.963]  I told you two weeks ago 14 states would be joining Texas and sending troops to the Texas border.
[01:00:19.103 --> 01:00:20.243]  It would sound unbelievable, wouldn't it?
[01:00:21.345 --> 01:00:22.346]  We're good to go.
[01:00:22.526 --> 01:00:24.707]  We're good to go.
[01:00:44.397 --> 01:00:44.977]  Thank you.
[01:00:45.217 --> 01:00:45.417]  Thank you.
[01:01:08.157 --> 01:01:17.866]  Here's a clip of nearly a year ago, David Miller, president of the Texas Nationalist Movement, made the case for the Tegxit, not the Brexit, the Tegxit, on American soil.
[01:01:17.886 --> 01:01:18.226]  Here it is.
[01:01:18.947 --> 01:01:23.952]  This really is a great solution to so many problems that we see coming out of Washington.
[01:01:24.847 --> 01:01:28.231]  Yeah, look, and, Harrison, I'll even pull it back out.
[01:01:28.271 --> 01:01:36.020]  I mean, obviously for us, you know, this is the shortest and quickest way to cut the Gordian Knot, you know, to untangle it is to cut it.
[01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:46.131]  When we look at the issues that we're facing here in Texas, whether it's the border crisis, whether it's, you know, taxation policies or monetary policies,
[01:01:46.631 --> 01:01:47.392]  We're good to go.
[01:02:13.371 --> 01:02:15.813]  Yeah, it's definitely a plan B, because if Texas goes, they've done major Pentagon analysis.
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:35.981]  We're good to go.
[01:02:36.041 --> 01:02:36.261]  I think?
[01:02:51.581 --> 01:03:14.713]  And I read the governor's statement earlier, but I want to go out to break and bring in our special guest, who's just at the Darien Gap, with Brett Weinstein and, of course, the great Michael Young, and to give his great research take as a scientist and an executive on what he's seeing down there, analyzing all of this, the CEO of Peak Prosperity, Chris Martinson, is going to be joining us here in just a few minutes.
[01:03:14.753 --> 01:03:15.834]  But I wanted to play this clip.
[01:03:16.474 --> 01:03:16.654]  I think?
[01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:46.961]  Anti-globalism, Team Humanity.
[01:03:47.021 --> 01:03:50.945]  The shirts are now in stock, now shipping an image of the nuclear family.
[01:03:51.446 --> 01:03:54.909]  Team Humanity, 1776, Infowars.com.
[01:03:55.269 --> 01:03:59.534]  Here is Governor Greg Abbott, and we'll come right back in just about a minute or two with our special guest.
[01:04:00.273 --> 01:04:02.435]  Texas is doing is just very simple.
[01:04:03.215 --> 01:04:12.222]  And that is because the Biden administration has really, truly abdicated its responsibility to secure the border and enforce the laws.
[01:04:12.823 --> 01:04:15.425]  Texas very simply is securing the border.
[01:04:15.905 --> 01:04:23.131]  And so we put up the razor wire that you were talking about, Bill, and we put up all these barricades that actually have denied illegal entry.
[01:04:23.731 --> 01:04:27.314]  And as you pointed out also in that screen, that there are criminals coming across our border.
[01:04:27.734 --> 01:04:37.663]  Texas has a right as a state to stop criminals from coming into our state, to make arrests of those criminals.
[01:04:38.323 --> 01:04:46.550]  And we have National Guard as well as Texas Department of Public Safety officers who are there to make those arrests and to deny illegal entry.
[01:04:47.071 --> 01:04:49.373]  And Joe Biden actually does have an option here.
[01:04:49.873 --> 01:04:55.178]  Joe Biden's option is to enforce the laws of the United States and stop this illegal entry.
[01:05:00.731 --> 01:05:04.855]  You know, I sit up here and I yell and scream about the New World Order and the globalists.
[01:05:04.875 --> 01:05:08.980]  They're planning to get rid of the borders and release a virus and have a global power grab.
[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:10.061]  And you saw it all come true.
[01:05:11.182 --> 01:05:11.903]  But there's a...
[01:05:13.047 --> 01:05:13.848]  Inverse of that.
[01:05:14.568 --> 01:05:17.270]  There's not just the bad stuff I'm telling you about.
[01:05:17.610 --> 01:05:19.571]  There's the good stuff I'm telling you about.
[01:05:20.331 --> 01:05:24.974]  And just like our information is the best you're going to find out there, our supplements are amazing.
[01:05:25.615 --> 01:05:29.377]  So our new special in the last half of January 2024 is here.
[01:05:29.877 --> 01:05:34.220]  It's Real Red Pill Plus and DNA Force Plus, both 50% off.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:37.462]  We're calling it the Supercharged Special.
[01:05:38.122 --> 01:05:43.967]  You can get either one of these great items at 40% off individually or together for 50% off.
[01:05:44.267 --> 01:05:48.170]  Now, in the time we have left, I can't tell you why they're so great and what they do for your body.

[01:05:57.657 --> 01:05:58.378]  InfoWarsHore.com.
[01:06:12.935 --> 01:06:18.517]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:18.798 --> 01:06:23.899]  Well, Michael Young, you know, he does an incredible job exposing the human invasion systems they've set up.
[01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:30.242]  And he went with Chris Martinson, Dr. Chris Martinson, and Brett Weinstein, the scientist.
[01:06:30.542 --> 01:06:31.382]  He's also a scientist.
[01:06:31.922 --> 01:06:34.223]  He's also... Both these guys are best-selling authors.
[01:06:34.643 --> 01:06:35.384]  Down to...
[01:06:36.673 --> 01:06:37.333]  We're good to go.
[01:06:37.353 --> 01:06:37.574]  I think?
[01:07:01.386 --> 01:07:02.006]  We're good to go.
[01:07:25.752 --> 01:07:29.255]  Wherever you'd like to begin, Jan really respects you, and I know you are.
[01:07:29.275 --> 01:07:30.076]  I respect you as well.
[01:07:30.396 --> 01:07:32.218]  Give us your expert analysis on what you just saw.
[01:07:33.759 --> 01:07:35.320]  Well, you know, I've been resisting for a while.
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:38.683]  Michael's been inviting me down saying, Chris, you have to see this with your own eyes.
[01:07:38.743 --> 01:07:39.684]  You know, I'd seen the pictures.
[01:07:39.744 --> 01:07:40.945]  I'd seen, you know, the death train.
[01:07:40.985 --> 01:07:43.347]  I'd seen all the people coming under the lifted wire.
[01:07:43.367 --> 01:07:44.448]  But I had to go to the source.
[01:07:44.929 --> 01:07:53.156]  He takes me down there, and we rode a long, skinny dugout canoe four hours up into the jungle, right to one of the first camps where people, when they're coming out of the jungle...
[01:07:53.716 --> 01:07:54.437]  They land there.
[01:07:54.477 --> 01:08:00.122]  We saw Chinese people there, Afghans, Venezuelans, and basically every nationality.
[01:08:00.322 --> 01:08:03.284]  We saw it, and there's no other way to describe this, Alex.
[01:08:03.624 --> 01:08:05.586]  This is an invasion that's happening.
[01:08:07.267 --> 01:08:08.228]  You were just there for a week.
[01:08:08.268 --> 01:08:08.849]  Tell us what you saw.
[01:08:10.629 --> 01:08:17.235]  We saw... Listen, a lot of people yearning to be free, but they clearly all had gotten the message that it was okay, now's the time.
[01:08:17.255 --> 01:08:22.941]  We saw people who had been living successfully in other countries, like we met a Haitian who was in Chile.
[01:08:23.201 --> 01:08:24.262]  He'd been there seven years.
[01:08:24.302 --> 01:08:25.983]  He had his five-year-old daughter with him.
[01:08:26.044 --> 01:08:26.984]  He was very well-dressed.
[01:08:27.044 --> 01:08:32.510]  He obviously had a decent life in Chile, but he had decided now's the time, now or never, get into the United States.
[01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:33.270]  So his daughter...
[01:08:34.011 --> 01:08:34.551]  We're good to go.
[01:08:57.099 --> 01:08:58.359]  By this, I mean there's support.
[01:08:58.399 --> 01:08:59.860]  People pull up to these towns.
[01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:02.482]  They can buy flip-flops, sleeping gear, headlamps.
[01:09:02.922 --> 01:09:04.823]  They've got maps where to go next.
[01:09:04.863 --> 01:09:06.104]  There's buses lining up.
[01:09:06.184 --> 01:09:15.010]  While we were there, they upped the buses heading north from 40 per day to 200 per day because that's what they had to do to navigate this incredible
[01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:15.931]  We're good to go.
[01:09:15.951 --> 01:09:16.171]  I think?
[01:09:31.112 --> 01:09:31.512]  We're good to go.
[01:09:48.038 --> 01:09:50.921]  And, Doctor, for those that don't study this and know, the Chinese and others...
[01:10:05.356 --> 01:10:06.416]  I mean, this is a major operation.
[01:10:35.578 --> 01:10:36.699]  I think we're good to go.
[01:10:57.313 --> 01:10:57.794]  We're good to go.
[01:10:57.814 --> 01:10:58.014]  I think?
[01:11:21.557 --> 01:11:21.977]  We're good to go.
[01:11:44.389 --> 01:11:48.195]  That was my next point, is they're building the bridges, they're building the infrastructures.
[01:11:48.215 --> 01:11:50.057]  It's not just big boats bringing them across now.
[01:11:50.858 --> 01:11:59.110]  The infrastructure is now there, so it's not the first waves, you know, that are the people trying to flee, the entrepreneurs, the intelligence assets, the spies.
[01:11:59.510 --> 01:12:01.293]  Now it's the giant unwashed masses.
[01:12:03.024 --> 01:12:05.005]  Yeah, and the point is very clear.
[01:12:05.065 --> 01:12:09.648]  They want to do this because they think it's a good thing, that somehow this is beneficial.
[01:12:09.688 --> 01:12:16.112]  Nobody ever asked the question, are these people's lives actually better than if we had just given them a few bucks and told them to stay home?
[01:12:16.593 --> 01:12:20.935]  Is this any better than helping the countries where these people actually are?
[01:12:20.975 --> 01:12:23.157]  No, they've got this point of view, Alex, which is,
[01:12:23.817 --> 01:12:24.678]  This is a good thing.
[01:12:24.998 --> 01:12:28.760]  But if it's such a good thing, why do they make them walk this perilous journey?
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:36.805]  There was a period of time when up to 10% of people trying to get through the Darien Gap were dying because these are people usually accustomed to warmer climates.
[01:12:37.166 --> 01:12:38.547]  They have to go over a 1,300 meter or a 4,000 foot
[01:12:41.068 --> 01:12:43.050]  These people are getting raped, abused.
[01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:46.754]  There are cartels and coyotes and all sorts of criminals along the way taking money from them.
[01:12:46.834 --> 01:12:47.474]  And at the end of it,
[01:13:03.289 --> 01:13:10.014]  Three to five thousand dollars, they said, is what it would cost them to make this journey once they got into the Darien Gap to get into the U.S.
[01:13:10.054 --> 01:13:11.855]  Well, that's more than a plane ticket.
[01:13:12.035 --> 01:13:17.478]  Why would you make people go through this Kabuki theater if you just wanted them to come into the country?
[01:13:17.799 --> 01:13:18.699]  It's a very bizarre thing.
[01:13:18.739 --> 01:13:20.840]  It's just like many things that we're seeing these days.
[01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:22.842]  Well, it puts them under the control of the U.N.
[01:13:22.882 --> 01:13:23.742]  refugee centers.
[01:13:24.023 --> 01:13:24.763]  They're given U.N.
[01:13:24.823 --> 01:13:25.423]  cell phones.
[01:13:25.764 --> 01:13:26.884]  They're then told where to go.
[01:13:26.944 --> 01:13:30.627]  They've been brainwashed and put through months of boot camp before they come in.
[01:13:32.333 --> 01:13:32.913]  Absolutely.
[01:13:33.534 --> 01:13:36.275]  And they are being distributed to communities all over the place.
[01:13:36.295 --> 01:13:38.737]  So this really, this, Alex, this trip changed me.
[01:13:39.197 --> 01:13:41.078]  Before I was thinking, okay, this is a problem.
[01:13:41.158 --> 01:13:42.959]  Now I actually think this is beyond a problem.
[01:13:42.979 --> 01:13:44.500]  This is like blinking red lights.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.962]  I don't even know what we'll do, if or when, it turns out.
[01:13:48.002 --> 01:13:50.643]  Like, we've already heard Senator Dick Durbin say, hey, you know what we want to do?
[01:13:50.663 --> 01:13:55.846]  We want to take these people who are illegal immigrants and give them a path to citizenship by putting them in the army.
[01:13:56.247 --> 01:13:57.447]  What a terrible idea.
[01:13:57.467 --> 01:14:00.029]  And Germany just announced they're going mercenary force.
[01:14:00.789 --> 01:14:02.191]  Yeah, this is a larger plan.
[01:14:03.552 --> 01:14:05.754]  Yeah, and then look at all the overlaps, right?
[01:14:06.054 --> 01:14:09.718]  Obviously, Democrats think they get voters out of this, so they like that because it keeps them in power.
[01:14:10.378 --> 01:14:22.229]  Maybe you could get a very compliant military force for who knows what sorts of reasons, but, you know, when we saw inauguration in 2021, we saw how National Guard troops were used to keep American citizens away from the inauguration.
[01:14:22.249 --> 01:14:22.470]  Maybe...
[01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:24.491]  Maybe that didn't go as smoothly as they wanted.
[01:14:24.571 --> 01:14:26.671]  Maybe people put up a protest there.
[01:14:26.771 --> 01:14:27.151]  I don't know.
[01:14:27.552 --> 01:14:32.273]  But it clearly makes no sense for our country, the United States, or for Europe.
[01:14:32.313 --> 01:14:34.874]  This is an invasion, right?
[01:14:35.254 --> 01:14:38.936]  And that, to me, they're trying to say, oh, this is a racist theory you might have.
[01:14:38.956 --> 01:14:41.656]  It's like, no, no, there's a culture war at hand.
[01:14:41.676 --> 01:14:43.257]  There's some cultures just don't mix.
[01:14:43.277 --> 01:14:45.558]  There's only so fast a new culture can absorb.
[01:14:46.218 --> 01:14:50.120]  So they're bringing in a permanent underclass they control.
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:59.943]  So what is your take on, within just 48 hours, 14 states joining Texas, seven of them sending troops, Biden threatening to nationalize the State Guard.
[01:14:59.964 --> 01:15:02.244]  I mean, this is a constitutional crisis right now.
[01:15:03.565 --> 01:15:05.206]  Absolutely, but bring it on.
[01:15:05.266 --> 01:15:07.186]  We've had a constitutional crisis for a long time.
[01:15:07.246 --> 01:15:08.267]  I'm a huge fan of this.
[01:15:08.347 --> 01:15:09.407]  I totally agree.
[01:15:09.527 --> 01:15:10.948]  Abbott's forcing it out in the open.
[01:15:12.264 --> 01:15:12.505]  Good.
[01:15:12.946 --> 01:15:13.688]  Let's do that.
[01:15:13.708 --> 01:15:18.641]  It's very fashionable to bash Abbott, and I've been a big critic, but I mean, this is good, I think, what he's doing.
[01:15:20.018 --> 01:15:25.120]  I've also been a big critic, but this I like, because I just want to, let's have the conversation.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:27.501]  And if it has to come down to it, let's have the fight.
[01:15:27.521 --> 01:15:33.003]  You know, as Michael explained to me, he said, if you're in Sweden, if you're a male, you really only have two choices left, right?
[01:15:33.163 --> 01:15:35.965]  Get some testosterone and fight, or you've got to flee.
[01:15:36.345 --> 01:15:38.806]  Because at some point, those are your only choices.
[01:15:38.826 --> 01:15:39.286]  That's right.
[01:15:39.686 --> 01:15:41.107]  80% of these are military-age males.
[01:15:41.167 --> 01:15:42.587]  It's not women and children.
[01:15:42.827 --> 01:15:43.768]  So let me ask you this.
[01:15:44.288 --> 01:15:44.388]  Yeah.
[01:15:44.729 --> 01:15:53.425]  What was your views before you went and spent a month on the border in the jungle, on the border of Central and South America in Panama, versus your views now?
[01:15:55.785 --> 01:16:02.410]  Before, I thought, well, you know, it just sort of felt like some kind of a democratic thing maybe to get some voters.
[01:16:02.491 --> 01:16:10.957]  Now I understand that this is actually part of a larger plan to completely, if possible, undermine my culture, my country.
[01:16:11.758 --> 01:16:20.285]  I see this now as an official act of people who misguided or however you want to frame what they're thinking, but some of them know exactly what they're doing.
[01:16:20.325 --> 01:16:23.628]  Their intention is very clearly to undermine the country
[01:16:24.349 --> 01:16:29.896]  And if they can destroy it, I think that's within the wheelhouse of possibilities now.
[01:16:29.997 --> 01:16:30.637]  That's how I see it.
[01:16:30.698 --> 01:16:33.361]  This is an intentional act to destroy the country.
[01:16:35.484 --> 01:16:36.906]  Continue, sir, with the time we have left.
[01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:37.988]  We've got about 12 minutes left.
[01:16:38.008 --> 01:16:38.529]  Please continue.
[01:16:40.942 --> 01:16:44.264]  So, look, we've been looking at... Ever since COVID, we found out a lot of things, right?
[01:16:44.284 --> 01:16:45.786]  I studied COVID really intensely.
[01:16:46.166 --> 01:16:51.149]  There's very odd things about the mRNA shots, very odd things about, in fact, everything.
[01:16:51.890 --> 01:16:59.395]  The lockdowns, the masks, the distancing, the essential versus non-essential workers, the shots that were neither safe nor effective, that didn't stop transmission.
[01:16:59.555 --> 01:17:03.458]  Every single thing, Alex, that they could have done, they did wrong.
[01:17:04.039 --> 01:17:04.359]  Meaning...
[01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:08.203]  By coin flip, you'd have had to have gotten something right sooner or later, right?
[01:17:08.843 --> 01:17:09.244]  They didn't.
[01:17:09.684 --> 01:17:17.271]  And so in the context of that, we saw that we had weaponized propaganda and fifth-generation warfare tactics being used against us.
[01:17:17.591 --> 01:17:19.072]  And this fits into that.
[01:17:19.112 --> 01:17:24.777]  So I can't see the immigration issue, the migrant issue, the invasion as separate or distinct from these other efforts.
[01:17:24.817 --> 01:17:25.918]  This is an attack vector.
[01:17:26.358 --> 01:17:28.961]  It's one of the things that they are bringing forward into this country.
[01:17:29.221 --> 01:17:29.962]  Explain attack.
[01:17:30.002 --> 01:17:32.544]  For people who don't know this stuff, what's an attack vector?
[01:17:34.184 --> 01:17:39.908]  This is, if you're going to attack something, you're going to come at it from multiple angles, right?
[01:17:40.008 --> 01:17:42.569]  So you want to weaken everything you can.
[01:17:42.589 --> 01:17:48.353]  And by the time, you know, if people think of war and warfare, they think, oh, that's when the bullets and missiles fly.
[01:17:48.473 --> 01:17:50.995]  Actually, it's mostly over at that point in time.
[01:17:51.035 --> 01:17:51.935]  What happens first?
[01:17:52.015 --> 01:17:52.415]  That's right.
[01:17:52.435 --> 01:17:53.696]  The table gets set first.
[01:17:53.736 --> 01:17:54.297]  You're dead on.
[01:17:54.337 --> 01:17:54.737]  Explain that.
[01:17:56.004 --> 01:17:57.265]  So the table is being set.
[01:17:57.545 --> 01:17:59.987]  You want a demoralized, weakened enemy.
[01:18:00.007 --> 01:18:01.288]  I mean, this is old stuff, right?
[01:18:01.308 --> 01:18:03.470]  Sun Tzu talked about this thousands of years ago.
[01:18:03.950 --> 01:18:10.476]  The first thing you want to do is you want to make sure that the people you're invading or the country or battles that you're about to fight have already been fought.
[01:18:10.936 --> 01:18:11.757]  The table's been set.
[01:18:12.057 --> 01:18:12.978]  People are confused.
[01:18:13.018 --> 01:18:14.139]  They don't know what's going on.
[01:18:14.559 --> 01:18:18.162]  And by the way, this is being done within our own country.
[01:18:18.562 --> 01:18:19.303]  They put you off balance.
[01:18:45.509 --> 01:18:45.669]  Yep.
[01:18:46.290 --> 01:18:50.453]  So we're facing that, and this is very off-balance, because think about this.
[01:18:50.473 --> 01:18:51.593]  Think about the lesson here.
[01:18:51.653 --> 01:18:55.276]  So you look at these pictures where people are just streaming over the border.
[01:18:55.616 --> 01:18:57.718]  What is a nation without a border?
[01:18:58.618 --> 01:18:59.419]  It's not a nation.
[01:18:59.779 --> 01:19:01.700]  That's what defines a nation, is having a border.
[01:19:01.721 --> 01:19:02.941]  So we don't have a border.
[01:19:03.362 --> 01:19:06.324]  Our children today are confused over whether they're male or female.
[01:19:06.404 --> 01:19:08.105]  How did that exactly happen?
[01:19:08.485 --> 01:19:13.349]  We lost all the basic principles of public health.
[01:19:13.849 --> 01:19:14.509]  It's a fog of war.
[01:19:14.529 --> 01:19:15.110]  You won't trust anything.
[01:19:15.130 --> 01:19:16.631]  Particularly, this is when they win.
[01:19:16.651 --> 01:19:18.492]  When you don't even trust yourself.
[01:19:42.928 --> 01:19:48.194]  So people can see with their own lion eyes that this is an invasion, but they don't call it that.
[01:19:48.234 --> 01:19:50.276]  They say, oh, you must be racist if you think that.
[01:19:50.316 --> 01:19:55.121]  So it's the gaslighting, it's the cognitive confusion, it's the reframing of words.
[01:19:55.142 --> 01:19:59.927]  It's what they've done to the average liberal, going against their own self-interest but cult-like support.
[01:20:01.639 --> 01:20:02.259]  Absolutely.
[01:20:02.319 --> 01:20:05.381]  And it's ridiculously powerful how good this is now.
[01:20:06.021 --> 01:20:07.182]  And I've been really impressed.
[01:20:07.202 --> 01:20:08.763]  You know, golf claps for what they've pulled off.
[01:20:09.043 --> 01:20:10.023]  It's really impressive.
[01:20:10.063 --> 01:20:16.007]  We've seen people, I'm sure you've met them, who've completely lost their ability to reason and make sense of the world anymore.
[01:20:16.187 --> 01:20:17.788]  They just say nonsense stuff, right?
[01:20:18.268 --> 01:20:22.690]  OBGYN doctors telling pregnant women it's safe to get this shot when it's never been tested.
[01:20:22.730 --> 01:20:26.812]  And the basis of science and medicine is testing and data, right?
[01:20:27.052 --> 01:20:27.973]  It's a bizarre thing.
[01:20:28.673 --> 01:20:34.817]  But here's where we are, and so maybe I should ask you, though, I mean, what is the, where are they going with this?
[01:20:35.297 --> 01:20:47.825]  Because the way I look at it, because I study the economy deeply, I study energy, I study all the systems deeply, I think, Alex, they're risking breaking this, because I don't think they, they might not know what they're doing.
[01:20:48.105 --> 01:20:49.786]  I'm very worried where they're taking us.
[01:20:50.346 --> 01:20:50.867]  Absolutely.
[01:20:50.887 --> 01:20:51.367]  Look, the global...
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:53.020]  We're good to go.
[01:21:16.858 --> 01:21:22.779]  Very dangerous, because in my life, let's call them neocons, whatever we call them, they don't have reverse gear, right?
[01:21:22.839 --> 01:21:24.640]  They only double down, triple down.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.240]  So where do we go from here, right?
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:32.201]  Count me among the people who think starting a war with a nuclear superpower is a very bad idea.
[01:21:32.721 --> 01:21:33.661]  I'm not alone in that.
[01:21:34.021 --> 01:21:35.922]  But that's part of fifth generation warfare.
[01:21:35.942 --> 01:21:38.602]  They want you and I and everybody listening to feel like we're alone.
[01:21:38.962 --> 01:21:39.483]  We're not.
[01:21:39.783 --> 01:21:44.244]  That's why Sean Penn came out last year and said, nuclear war is okay, let's have one.
[01:21:44.264 --> 01:21:46.444]  It's cuckoo land.
[01:21:47.825 --> 01:21:53.431]  It's totally cuckoo land, but this is where they're going with this, and you can tell that they're going to take us to a very bad spot.
[01:21:53.771 --> 01:22:00.298]  The concern everybody ought to have is that they're going to push this to a point where it breaks, but they know not what they do.
[01:22:00.919 --> 01:22:10.589]  I was just talking with some people in the Christian community who feel very much like they're under attack, like the globalists feel like Christianity, for some reason, is too much of a bulwark against their...
[01:22:11.309 --> 01:22:12.049]  Whatever they want.
[01:22:12.349 --> 01:22:14.350]  There's not room for their ideology.
[01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:16.630]  Oh, there's no doubt there's an attack on Christianity.
[01:22:17.010 --> 01:22:22.471]  Netflix and HBO and Amazon all have shows saying Satan's actually the good guy.
[01:22:22.491 --> 01:22:24.971]  Did you know about this?
[01:22:25.031 --> 01:22:26.352]  Yeah, I think I saw some of that.
[01:22:26.372 --> 01:22:29.472]  I haven't watched any of it yet, but maybe I will just to see the ending.
[01:22:29.492 --> 01:22:31.453]  Yeah, we haven't gotten to it yet because there's so much of it.
[01:22:31.493 --> 01:22:37.774]  I've got like seven or eight pro-Satan shows that are produced by all the big companies like Satan's Good, Christians Are Bad.
[01:22:37.794 --> 01:22:39.294]  I mean, these people are...
[01:22:41.095 --> 01:22:43.318]  Yeah, and they do their little winks.
[01:22:43.718 --> 01:22:45.960]  They like to put that stuff right out in public, of course.
[01:22:47.042 --> 01:22:48.443]  They've got their occult symbology.
[01:22:48.463 --> 01:22:49.424]  They do all of that stuff.
[01:22:49.644 --> 01:22:50.185]  Who knows why?
[01:22:50.205 --> 01:22:55.691]  The concern everybody should have, and the reason I do what I do at Peak Prosperity is I think everybody's got to get individually involved
[01:22:56.232 --> 01:22:56.552]  Ready.
[01:22:57.073 --> 01:22:58.013]  You've got to be resilient.
[01:22:58.033 --> 01:22:59.034]  You've got to be prepared.
[01:22:59.274 --> 01:23:00.814]  I know you talk about this all the time.
[01:23:00.834 --> 01:23:09.439]  I think one of the highest services we can do is to tell people, brace for impact, because these people in charge, they're going to break this before anything gets better.
[01:23:12.761 --> 01:23:14.462]  Dr., how else do you think we counter this?
[01:23:14.542 --> 01:23:22.728]  I mean, looking at the 14 states lined up, troops being sent, I'm concerned that the deep state may stage a false flag, truck bombs, shoot up a bunch of migrants.
[01:23:23.088 --> 01:23:26.210]  I mean, if I was them, they're losing their hearts and minds right now.
[01:23:26.611 --> 01:23:30.053]  I would need something to demonize anybody against open borders.
[01:23:30.153 --> 01:23:31.074]  I would stage a false flag.
[01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:35.302]  Yeah, hey, I would too, but that's just playing the odds, right?
[01:23:35.422 --> 01:23:37.183]  This is what they've done all through history.
[01:23:37.223 --> 01:23:38.924]  They've always just played the false flags.
[01:23:38.964 --> 01:23:45.849]  The one thing we know is that given a choice between being honest and doing something underhanded, they'll always do the underhanded thing.
[01:23:46.249 --> 01:23:47.210]  It's by default.
[01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:48.450]  That's their default mechanism.
[01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:50.812]  So I think everybody needs to be prepared for that.
[01:23:50.892 --> 01:23:53.694]  The way we fight this, though, is first you have to know what they're doing.
[01:23:53.714 --> 01:23:54.634]  You need the context.
[01:23:54.694 --> 01:23:54.995]  Second...
[01:23:55.715 --> 01:23:58.836]  I think it's insufficient to just think, you know, I reject this.
[01:23:59.176 --> 01:24:00.236]  You have to say it out loud.
[01:24:01.116 --> 01:24:04.277]  I do not consent to these people doing what they're doing to our children.
[01:24:04.437 --> 01:24:08.018]  I do not consent to what they're doing in terms of overrunning my country.
[01:24:08.038 --> 01:24:08.298]  That's right.
[01:24:08.318 --> 01:24:11.159]  The first thing is saying we see the problem and we don't agree with it.
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:12.940]  Absolutely.
[01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:15.180]  You know, as I speak, it becomes so.
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:15.980]  It's magic, right?
[01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:17.301]  You've got to put it out there and say no.
[01:24:18.719 --> 01:24:25.903]  And if we don't do that now, we're going to be facing a situation where we're going to actually have to do more than that soon, right?
[01:24:25.983 --> 01:24:27.004]  That's what comes next.
[01:24:27.624 --> 01:24:31.226]  And this is what we call an adjustment reaction in the space I'm in.
[01:24:31.266 --> 01:24:35.888]  So an adjustment reaction is you see a huge risk coming, and you do something to prepare for that.
[01:24:36.068 --> 01:24:38.910]  And at the time, it feels like a complete overreaction.
[01:24:38.950 --> 01:24:39.870]  Oh my gosh, I'm a nut.
[01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:41.111]  I have food in my basement.
[01:24:41.151 --> 01:24:42.852]  I got some self-protection.
[01:24:42.872 --> 01:24:43.392]  I got some weapons.
[01:24:43.432 --> 01:24:43.893]  I got some ammo.
[01:24:43.953 --> 01:24:44.513]  What a nut.
[01:24:45.347 --> 01:24:49.769]  When the thing actually happens, you look back and realize this was a complete underreaction.
[01:24:50.269 --> 01:24:52.730]  That's where we're caught, and I know people are struggling with that.
[01:24:52.750 --> 01:24:53.170]  Exactly.
[01:24:53.330 --> 01:24:54.651]  The guns are a side issue.
[01:24:54.691 --> 01:24:56.851]  It's the political operation that matters.
[01:24:57.812 --> 01:25:00.633]  Because you said 90% of the war happens before the shooting.
[01:25:02.057 --> 01:25:02.577]  Absolutely.
[01:25:02.917 --> 01:25:03.698]  It's underway.
[01:25:03.858 --> 01:25:05.978]  That war has actually been run for years now.
[01:25:06.078 --> 01:25:09.519]  People need to understand it for what it actually is.
[01:25:09.539 --> 01:25:12.640]  And its aim is your cognitive landscape.
[01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:13.501]  It's your mind.
[01:25:13.861 --> 01:25:21.483]  They win when you are confused about everything, you feel isolated, alone, and most importantly, this is their main target, you are demoralized.
[01:25:22.404 --> 01:25:23.284]  They have all the power.
[01:25:24.192 --> 01:25:25.153]  There's nothing I can do.
[01:25:26.033 --> 01:25:26.974]  And that's when they win.
[01:25:27.234 --> 01:25:31.497]  But that's a lie because they have a lot of stolen power, but giving in gives them power.
[01:25:31.837 --> 01:25:33.178]  Resisting gives us all the power.
[01:25:33.458 --> 01:25:34.919]  The only way to go is resistance.
[01:25:35.119 --> 01:25:35.940]  There's not even a choice.
[01:25:37.561 --> 01:25:38.281]  Well, absolutely.
[01:25:38.321 --> 01:25:41.243]  And what they're afraid of, of course, is the numbers game, right?
[01:25:41.423 --> 01:25:46.046]  Just like the Aztecs of old, when the people finally rose up, weren't that many priests at the end of the day?
[01:25:46.587 --> 01:25:48.008]  So we read about Davos, right?
[01:25:48.068 --> 01:25:50.029]  Right now, undergoing just this past week.
[01:25:50.069 --> 01:25:52.471]  And they said, oh, we want to restore trust, you know?
[01:25:53.391 --> 01:25:54.893]  3,000 people showed up to that.
[01:25:55.273 --> 01:25:56.675]  That's 3,000, right?
[01:25:56.755 --> 01:26:02.000]  That's literally one day's worth of people who came across at Eagle Pass, Texas a week ago, right?
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:07.305]  It's tiny, but they want to maintain as if they have all the power, and they don't.
[01:26:07.986 --> 01:26:10.488]  It requires us to consent to giving that power.
[01:26:10.748 --> 01:26:11.749]  You're right.
[01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:13.251]  It's all a giant confidence game.
[01:26:13.531 --> 01:26:17.015]  So what would you advise Governor Abbott and others to do right now, Doctor?
[01:26:19.655 --> 01:26:22.136]  Keep that spine and fortify it with titanium.
[01:26:22.237 --> 01:26:24.718]  It is time absolutely for a showdown.
[01:26:24.758 --> 01:26:26.518]  And I would be looking for a public display.
[01:26:26.838 --> 01:26:30.140]  I wouldn't just be waiting to react to something the federal government did.
[01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:34.382]  I would want to establish myself and establish it because he's already thrown the gauntlet down.
[01:26:35.669 --> 01:26:42.271]  Hey, you have abdicated your role as a rightful purveyor and keeper of the laws.
[01:26:42.692 --> 01:26:45.052]  Since you didn't do that, we're stepping in and we're doing that.
[01:26:45.212 --> 01:26:50.654]  And I would set a condition that says, and by the way, we are not relinquishing this back to you until you meet these standards.
[01:26:50.714 --> 01:26:51.775]  You just lay it down.
[01:26:51.795 --> 01:26:52.355]  Absolutely.
[01:26:52.435 --> 01:26:55.076]  And the feds say, no, we just ignore them.
[01:26:55.636 --> 01:26:59.978]  I'm a little concerned about the Supreme Court being blackmailed, though, with this ruling saying get rid of the barbed wire.
[01:27:00.278 --> 01:27:00.758]  What do you think?
[01:27:02.555 --> 01:27:03.235]  Very high chance.
[01:27:03.255 --> 01:27:09.518]  Look, we have to get to the bottom of who's on the Epstein list and why and all of that, and I believe that there's some Supreme Court members on that list, right?
[01:27:09.558 --> 01:27:12.159]  So we have to understand what actually happened there.
[01:27:12.299 --> 01:27:19.062]  It's very clear that you can't make sense of some things except they start to make a lot of sense when you understand the blackmail game.
[01:27:19.102 --> 01:27:27.506]  This has been going on for a long time, and I think it's just time for all of us good people out here in America to recognize something.
[01:27:28.490 --> 01:27:31.434]  It's not just there's a little bit of rot in Washington, D.C.
[01:27:31.474 --> 01:27:33.197]  It's not just there's something's a little off.
[01:27:33.717 --> 01:27:36.702]  This game is completely wrong at this point in time.
[01:27:36.722 --> 01:27:39.405]  Yeah, this is a group that's decided to engage in a high-tech coup.
[01:27:39.686 --> 01:27:41.308]  Here's a short clip because I want to get it on record.
[01:27:41.809 --> 01:27:45.293]  Biden, this candidate Biden, saying, when I win, immediately surge the border.
[01:27:46.291 --> 01:27:50.534]  What I would do as president is several more things, because things have changed.
[01:27:50.934 --> 01:27:55.597]  I would, in fact, make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[01:27:55.977 --> 01:27:57.618]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[01:27:57.878 --> 01:27:58.839]  They deserve to be heard.
[01:27:58.859 --> 01:27:59.719]  That's who we are.
[01:28:00.059 --> 01:28:03.962]  We're a nation that says if you want to flee and you're fleeing oppression, you should come.
[01:28:04.322 --> 01:28:11.867]  I would change the order that the president just changed, saying women who were being beaten and abused could no longer claim that as a reason for asylum.
[01:28:12.878 --> 01:28:13.898]  So that's his cover story.
[01:28:14.539 --> 01:28:17.500]  Dr. Chris Martinson, peakprosperity.com.
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:21.982]  People can go there, find all your great work, your book, and so much more.
[01:28:22.042 --> 01:28:23.062]  Thank you so much for your time.
[01:28:24.223 --> 01:28:26.043]  Thank you so much for the opportunity to be here.
[01:28:26.403 --> 01:28:27.504]  Love to have you in the studio sometime.
[01:28:28.163 --> 01:28:29.244]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[01:28:29.384 --> 01:28:32.385]  I've got a bunch of news I haven't hit and a bunch of breaking news that's coming in right now.
[01:28:32.905 --> 01:28:34.966]  But I want to give the toll-free number out.
[01:28:35.527 --> 01:28:41.189]  I want to take your phone calls on 14 states joining Texas, seven of them, sending troops.
[01:28:41.710 --> 01:28:44.951]  What's Biden and Obama and the globalists going to do next?
[01:28:45.451 --> 01:28:46.472]  This is wild.
[01:28:47.492 --> 01:28:49.413]  We'll give the number out when we come back.
[01:28:49.493 --> 01:28:51.895]  On the other side, InfoWars.com.
[01:28:51.915 --> 01:28:54.076]  Tomorrow's news today, Band.Video.
[01:28:54.156 --> 01:28:55.817]  It's where you find all the censored videos.
[01:28:55.897 --> 01:28:56.477]  Band.Video.
[01:28:58.669 --> 01:29:00.932]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[01:29:01.092 --> 01:29:01.433]  Thank you.
[01:29:01.633 --> 01:29:04.197]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[01:29:04.257 --> 01:29:05.519]  I started taking that stuff.
[01:29:05.579 --> 01:29:08.763]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[01:29:08.883 --> 01:29:09.764]  When did you start taking it?
[01:29:10.045 --> 01:29:14.030]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure, and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[01:29:14.150 --> 01:29:14.411]  Mm-hmm.
[01:29:14.651 --> 01:29:17.352]  And I started eating a little better, but my blood pressure stayed high.
[01:29:17.372 --> 01:29:24.896]  And when I took the X2 iodine after about two or four weeks, I think my body was detoxified of a bunch of metals and stuff that my body was storing.
[01:29:25.016 --> 01:29:27.217]  And my blood pressure came down to the perfect level.
[01:29:27.597 --> 01:29:30.579]  And I tell people the only thing I did with X2 iodine
[01:29:30.999 --> 01:29:31.580]  I'm good to go.
[01:29:58.834 --> 01:30:03.059]  The Second American Revolution is happening now right in front of you.
[01:30:03.379 --> 01:30:07.744]  And you're tuned in to InfoWars because you're either looking for the truth or you're already a patriot.
[01:30:08.204 --> 01:30:16.052]  I'm asking you now to realize we are at the fulcrum, the crossroads in the fight for human destiny and human future.
[01:30:16.793 --> 01:30:17.574]  We're good to go.
[01:30:35.487 --> 01:30:36.728]  InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:30:37.068 --> 01:30:40.190]  If you want to support the tip of the spear, that decision is up to you.
[01:30:40.210 --> 01:30:41.591]  Please support us now at Full Restore.
[01:30:58.629 --> 01:31:02.371]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[01:31:02.692 --> 01:31:05.854]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[01:31:06.254 --> 01:31:10.717]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[01:31:11.357 --> 01:31:13.478]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[01:31:13.799 --> 01:31:21.764]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's You Will Eat the Bugs.
[01:31:22.404 --> 01:31:23.705]  This is The Great Awakening.

[01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:57.552]  The Great Awakening at InfoWars Store.
[01:31:58.342 --> 01:31:59.763]  Your products have changed my life.
[01:32:00.083 --> 01:32:02.224]  Your brain force and all that make me better.
[01:32:02.244 --> 01:32:03.364]  They make me more focused.
[01:32:03.444 --> 01:32:04.504]  They make me feel better.
[01:32:04.524 --> 01:32:08.806]  A lot of lingering effects from when I was getting sober have now relieved me.
[01:32:08.986 --> 01:32:10.847]  My girlfriend goes to the gym and goes hard.
[01:32:10.907 --> 01:32:11.587]  She's an American.
[01:32:11.747 --> 01:32:12.227]  The same stuff.
[01:32:12.688 --> 01:32:14.208]  These products will change your life.
[01:32:14.688 --> 01:32:19.490]  They fund one of the greatest things out there right now for us as free Americans.
[01:32:19.670 --> 01:32:21.031]  Please do these people a favor.
[01:32:21.411 --> 01:32:21.751]  We're good.
[01:32:42.523 --> 01:32:45.525]  Against tyranny the world has ever seen, and that's our American flag.
[01:32:45.545 --> 01:32:47.546]  And with that, I appreciate, love you for worse.
[01:32:47.606 --> 01:32:51.849]  I'll listen to you the day I die or you go off air, but I'm going to do my part to make sure you don't have a great day.
[01:32:59.953 --> 01:33:05.837]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:12.788 --> 01:33:13.668]  You've found it.
[01:33:13.988 --> 01:33:15.529]  The tip of the spear.
[01:33:16.029 --> 01:33:18.429]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:23.970 --> 01:33:27.191]  Alright, I want to open the phones up on one subject.
[01:33:28.171 --> 01:33:30.511]  Fourteen states joining Texas.
[01:33:31.071 --> 01:33:33.712]  Seven of them sending troops to the border.
[01:33:33.772 --> 01:33:41.193]  Texas saying they're going to ignore the feds because the feds are derelict in their duty and the governor quoting the state and federal constitutions.
[01:33:43.010 --> 01:33:43.391]  We're good to go.
[01:34:01.294 --> 01:34:01.674]  We're good to go.
[01:34:01.734 --> 01:34:02.395]  We're good to go.
[01:34:23.829 --> 01:34:25.430]  He said, the globalists hate us.
[01:34:25.450 --> 01:34:26.311]  They want to depopulate us.
[01:34:26.331 --> 01:34:27.011]  They want to kill us.
[01:34:28.232 --> 01:34:30.033]  I agreed with him, and I said, well, what do we call that?
[01:34:30.053 --> 01:34:30.633]  He goes, I don't know.
[01:34:30.693 --> 01:34:32.755]  And I said, how about Team Humanity?
[01:34:33.735 --> 01:34:34.516]  He said, I agree with you.
[01:34:34.536 --> 01:34:35.557]  Let's call it Team Humanity.
[01:34:35.897 --> 01:34:37.017]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:34:37.498 --> 01:34:38.438]  It's a limited edition.
[01:34:38.458 --> 01:34:39.339]  There's two different designs.
[01:34:39.659 --> 01:34:43.862]  It's the nuclear family, a man, a woman, a father, a mother, a little girl, a little boy.
[01:34:43.882 --> 01:34:47.724]  TeamHumanityInfoWars.com, 1776 on the back.
[01:34:48.124 --> 01:34:49.145]  It says Team Humanity.
[01:34:49.165 --> 01:34:50.286]  There's another version right there.
[01:34:51.741 --> 01:34:52.481]  I didn't design that one.
[01:34:52.521 --> 01:34:53.041]  I think it's great.
[01:34:53.402 --> 01:34:54.622]  I designed the last one we just showed.
[01:34:55.382 --> 01:34:56.983]  People ask, what is Team Humanity?
[01:34:57.063 --> 01:34:57.703]  What is this?
[01:34:58.223 --> 01:34:58.983]  They distract us.
[01:34:59.103 --> 01:35:02.964]  I'm not saying you're bad because you watch it with sports and movies and all these side issues.
[01:35:03.004 --> 01:35:03.144]  No.
[01:35:03.545 --> 01:35:05.125]  Humanity is under attack.
[01:35:05.185 --> 01:35:08.166]  And Team Humanity, the term Team Humanity is starting to really...
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:10.360]  Get picked up out there.
[01:35:10.941 --> 01:35:14.122]  So, hey, if you don't even buy the shirt from us as a fundraiser, go make your own shirt.
[01:35:14.662 --> 01:35:16.003]  My point is, I'm wearing it.
[01:35:16.043 --> 01:35:16.843]  It came in today.
[01:35:17.203 --> 01:35:18.464]  It's been in for like five, six days.
[01:35:18.504 --> 01:35:22.946]  They finally got me one because our shipping department warehouse is in Denver.
[01:35:22.986 --> 01:35:24.006]  So they had it a week ago.
[01:35:24.026 --> 01:35:24.646]  It's been shipping out.
[01:35:24.686 --> 01:35:26.307]  But I just got this a couple days ago.
[01:35:26.347 --> 01:35:27.067]  So we got it in.
[01:35:27.487 --> 01:35:28.468]  I'm wearing it right now.
[01:35:28.868 --> 01:35:31.609]  Please get your Team Humanity shirt shipping out now.
[01:35:32.129 --> 01:35:32.890]  Limited edition.
[01:35:33.390 --> 01:35:35.071]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:35:36.371 --> 01:35:38.053]  Infowarshow.com or 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[01:35:38.093 --> 01:35:41.938]  But the toll-free number to join us live on air for first-time callers is 877-789-2539.
[01:35:41.978 --> 01:35:42.919]  There it is on screen, 877-789-ALEX.
[01:35:56.015 --> 01:35:57.256]  877-789-2539.
[01:35:57.616 --> 01:36:06.842]  And for the next hour and 20-plus minutes, we are taking your calls live, unfiltered, unstructured.
[01:36:06.882 --> 01:36:07.782]  Just have a good phone.
[01:36:08.323 --> 01:36:09.183]  Agree, disagree.
[01:36:09.283 --> 01:36:10.424]  I just want to hear your ideas.
[01:36:10.544 --> 01:36:11.304]  I love your ideas.
[01:36:11.645 --> 01:36:16.107]  I love the different angles you take us in.
[01:36:16.127 --> 01:36:16.808]  877-789-2539.
[01:36:16.888 --> 01:36:19.770]  All right, Tucker's always on fire.
[01:36:20.190 --> 01:36:21.571]  But he's up in Canada right now.
[01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:25.031]  In fact, get that clip first.
[01:36:25.192 --> 01:36:32.899]  We did a play yesterday of him calling Trudeau up and saying, I'm coming up there to liberate your country from you.
[01:36:33.179 --> 01:36:35.241]  Trudeau that says he wants to be a Chinese dictator.
[01:36:36.362 --> 01:36:43.768]  And then Tucker slams the Canadian government for assisted suicide, targeting people whose ancestors built the country.
[01:36:44.229 --> 01:36:44.949]  Well, it's beyond that.
[01:36:44.969 --> 01:36:46.751]  They're targeting people that are wards of the state.
[01:36:47.352 --> 01:36:49.173]  So the state is their ward, and they decide to kill them.
[01:36:49.193 --> 01:36:49.533]  That's murder.
[01:36:50.450 --> 01:36:56.412]  Also, Tucker Carlson says transgenderism is a humiliation ritual, an attack on Christianity.
[01:36:56.572 --> 01:36:58.233]  Absolutely, it is an attack on humanity.
[01:36:59.093 --> 01:37:05.715]  In another clip in Canada, Tucker Carlson says the Democrats will do anything to stop Trump, including unspeakable things.
[01:37:05.795 --> 01:37:06.776]  I think that's all true.
[01:37:07.176 --> 01:37:10.377]  Let's play these clips back to back, and then we're going to your phone calls.
[01:37:14.335 --> 01:37:18.318]  Yes, hi.
[01:37:25.703 --> 01:37:30.166]  I couldn't understand the French part, but it's Tucker Carlson calling from the United States.
[01:37:30.886 --> 01:37:34.629]  And I'd be grateful if you'd pass a message on to the Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau.
[01:37:35.149 --> 01:37:37.611]  We are coming to liberate Canada.
[01:37:38.291 --> 01:37:41.013]  We are coming to liberate Canada.
[01:37:41.634 --> 01:37:42.474]  And we'll be there soon.
[01:37:42.915 --> 01:37:43.195]  Merci.
[01:37:45.939 --> 01:38:00.063]  If you're killing 50,000 of the citizens, and the government is doing that through the MAID program, and a lot of them are not actually terminally ill, they're just sad, and the government is encouraging them to submit to being killed by the government, and then we'll release the recent statistics.
[01:38:00.984 --> 01:38:01.584]  Like, what is that?
[01:38:02.784 --> 01:38:03.164]  What is that?
[01:38:03.224 --> 01:38:06.085]  Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
[01:38:06.425 --> 01:38:07.986]  It's killing large groups of people.
[01:38:08.066 --> 01:38:09.226]  And who are those people, by the way?
[01:38:09.266 --> 01:38:11.567]  We don't know, because your government hasn't released a stat.
[01:38:12.367 --> 01:38:13.967]  What percentage of those reported in Canada?
[01:38:14.027 --> 01:38:14.728]  I bet right around 100%.
[01:38:16.303 --> 01:38:23.528]  So if you're a government, you have the duty to your citizens, people who are from here, people whose ancestors built the place, not exclusively to them, but primarily to them, to your citizens.
[01:38:24.188 --> 01:38:26.369]  Like, why else do you exist except to serve your citizens?
[01:38:27.290 --> 01:38:31.773]  And if you're targeting your citizens, how many people who arrived in Canada in the last 10 years have opted into the main program?
[01:38:31.793 --> 01:38:32.473]  I don't know the answer.
[01:38:32.493 --> 01:38:33.134]  I'd better answer it.
[01:38:33.154 --> 01:38:35.135]  Because so many people are from here.
[01:38:36.256 --> 01:38:39.378]  Another government brags, oh, we're saving money because they died.
[01:38:40.899 --> 01:38:42.300]  That's the darkest thing I can imagine.
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:45.782]  I bet there's zero conversation about that in this country, because I know this country and I know what it's like.
[01:38:46.123 --> 01:38:46.603]  It's too horrible.
[01:38:46.643 --> 01:38:47.464]  No one wants to talk about it.
[01:38:47.484 --> 01:38:48.024]  You should talk about it.
[01:38:48.745 --> 01:38:52.527]  But more than anything, you should internalize the message of that, which is they hate me.
[01:38:52.847 --> 01:38:55.009]  They hate me to the point they're willing to kill me, which they are.
[01:38:55.029 --> 01:39:04.736]  And the third thing is, notice the erosion of your most basic civil liberties, not the ones granted to you by the crown, but the ones granted to you by God.
[01:39:06.076 --> 01:39:11.261]  And those would include the freedom of speech, which is inviolable.
[01:39:11.321 --> 01:39:15.345]  It cannot be taken from you no matter who is in Ottawa.
[01:39:15.685 --> 01:39:20.309]  Your rights remain the same because you were born with them because you are not a slave, you're a human being.
[01:39:20.329 --> 01:39:22.911]  You have inherent dignity because God made you.
[01:39:23.792 --> 01:39:24.433]  That's just a fact.
[01:39:26.451 --> 01:39:28.552]  And it goes right away.
[01:39:28.773 --> 01:39:35.617]  He's failing, doing so in the name of public safety, even as they make the public sphere much more dangerous, which they have, in case you haven't noticed.
[01:39:35.637 --> 01:39:39.400]  Canada has a lot more violent crime now than it did 20 years ago.
[01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:40.040]  Have you noticed?
[01:39:40.100 --> 01:39:40.601]  Of course you have.
[01:39:40.641 --> 01:39:41.221]  You live here.
[01:39:41.241 --> 01:39:45.404]  Now they're telling you you can't defend yourself against that crime.
[01:39:45.424 --> 01:39:46.424]  We're going to disarm you.
[01:39:46.464 --> 01:39:48.106]  You can't protect your life or your family.
[01:39:49.452 --> 01:39:51.113]  And you're like, oh yeah, it's for the public safety.
[01:39:51.133 --> 01:39:52.434]  It's just not a big deal.
[01:39:52.454 --> 01:39:53.074]  These are weapons.
[01:39:53.134 --> 01:40:03.021]  We're another weapons of self-defense, which you need and deserve as a free person, not a slave.
[01:40:05.262 --> 01:40:13.167]  And then they're subsidizing the media to the point where all of your big media outlets, which are disgusting, are state media.
[01:40:14.167 --> 01:40:17.369]  Because you take the state cash to watch CBC.
[01:40:17.389 --> 01:40:18.050]  I do, occasionally.
[01:40:19.062 --> 01:40:25.126]  I can turn in any hour of the day and I will learn that I'm racist for driving an SUV and not being trans.
[01:40:26.166 --> 01:40:29.608]  That's the whole schedule of the CBC program.
[01:40:30.189 --> 01:40:41.596]  So if they're limiting your freedom to say what you think, which is the freedom of conscience, the most basic of all freedom, your freedom to defend yourself and your family against bodily harm, which has got to be a twin to the first one,
[01:40:42.731 --> 01:40:55.102]  If they're taking away your voting power by changing the population of your country, which they are doing, and no one wants to talk about that, Canada has the highest immigration rate in the world for Canada.
[01:40:55.122 --> 01:40:56.143]  And shut up, racists!
[01:40:56.664 --> 01:40:57.324]  That's not racist.
[01:40:57.344 --> 01:40:58.786]  I don't care if you're coming from New Zealand.
[01:40:58.826 --> 01:41:02.889]  I don't care if you're taking the population of Stockholm and moving them to Canada.
[01:41:04.116 --> 01:41:04.516]  The history.
[01:41:21.687 --> 01:41:23.447]  You know, the iPhone makes history irrelevant.
[01:41:23.467 --> 01:41:24.348]  That's all about right now.
[01:41:25.588 --> 01:41:27.688]  But it's worth, like, learning some things about history.
[01:41:27.749 --> 01:41:29.349]  And here's my recommendation.
[01:41:29.429 --> 01:41:37.411]  Spend, you know, like an afternoon reading about the French Revolution, the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, the Spanish Civil War.
[01:41:38.071 --> 01:41:38.731]  By the way, hit pause.
[01:41:38.751 --> 01:41:41.452]  And what do they all have in common?
[01:41:41.552 --> 01:41:42.292]  Hit pause.
[01:41:42.412 --> 01:41:46.133]  If you're a TV listener or TV viewer, you can see this.
[01:41:46.153 --> 01:41:47.253]  If you're a radio listener, you can't.
[01:41:48.074 --> 01:41:48.734]  What is that, 30,000, 40,000 people?
[01:41:51.900 --> 01:41:52.640]  All packed.
[01:41:52.700 --> 01:41:54.281]  Look all the way back in the nosebleeds.
[01:41:54.301 --> 01:41:55.421]  There's Tucker Carlson in Canada.
[01:41:57.842 --> 01:42:02.363]  So is Tucker Carlson bigger since they fired him from Fox a year and a half ago, or is he smaller?
[01:42:04.024 --> 01:42:06.185]  All because there was X, a place he could be hurt.
[01:42:08.125 --> 01:42:09.206]  In fact, look up the numbers.
[01:42:09.586 --> 01:42:13.287]  I just said today 20,000 because I saw a close shot of the central crowd.
[01:42:13.327 --> 01:42:17.949]  No, that's like... That's 30,000, 40,000 people.
[01:42:21.479 --> 01:42:22.119]  We're good to go.
[01:42:44.088 --> 01:42:45.069]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:42:45.930 --> 01:42:47.031]  Absolutely over the top.
[01:42:47.651 --> 01:42:48.232]  I mean, look at this.
[01:42:48.612 --> 01:42:48.932]  Look at this.
[01:42:49.813 --> 01:42:51.175]  All the way up in the nosebleeds.
[01:42:51.815 --> 01:42:52.676]  And all the way back.
[01:42:52.756 --> 01:42:53.917]  And all the way around.
[01:42:56.279 --> 01:42:57.740]  Think that makes the establishment happy?
[01:42:58.761 --> 01:42:59.262]  Let's continue.
[01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:15.093]  Was a desire not to replace Christianity with reason, as the Jacobins claimed, but to crush and destroy and to humiliate Christians in a way that's very reminiscent of what the Romans did in the first and second centuries.
[01:43:15.774 --> 01:43:19.837]  It's not just like, oh, that's silly and superstitious, we're going to move on to something better.
[01:43:20.758 --> 01:43:21.118]  It's no.
[01:43:21.318 --> 01:43:22.199]  We're going to crush you.
[01:43:22.939 --> 01:43:24.780]  And we're going to ritually humiliate you.
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:26.560]  And that is very much what the trans thing is about.
[01:43:26.660 --> 01:43:28.861]  No one is helped by transgenderism.
[01:43:28.901 --> 01:43:33.883]  You've never met anyone who is happier because he's self-calibrated.
[01:43:33.943 --> 01:43:36.444]  I personally feel very sorry for trans people.
[01:43:36.524 --> 01:43:37.665]  I'm not angry at them at all.
[01:43:37.705 --> 01:43:41.346]  I think they are victims of bigger forces.
[01:43:42.027 --> 01:43:49.730]  But to officially promote that is a humiliation ritual designed to put Christians in an untenable position.
[01:43:50.410 --> 01:43:52.774]  Let's just be honest about it when we're seeing it.
[01:44:09.892 --> 01:44:12.993]  When Conrad Black ran the media in this country, it was a better time.
[01:44:14.494 --> 01:44:20.276]  That was a wonderful summation of the 2020 election in which Democrats cheated at scale.
[01:44:20.856 --> 01:44:21.177]  Fact.
[01:44:22.757 --> 01:44:25.018]  And I hope it plays out in the way that you describe.
[01:44:25.418 --> 01:44:30.480]  And in my personal view of it, my views align pretty substantially with Donald Trump's.
[01:44:30.961 --> 01:44:33.962]  Even if they didn't, I would vote for Donald Trump because you can't.
[01:44:35.002 --> 01:44:39.084]  And 250 years of representative democracy gives you a lot of data.
[01:44:39.885 --> 01:44:40.505]  Period.
[01:44:40.525 --> 01:44:43.226]  You can't indict people for political reasons, which they have done.
[01:44:43.246 --> 01:44:48.469]  And you can't take people off the ballot in the name of democracy when they haven't been convicted of a crime!
[01:44:48.489 --> 01:44:49.930]  I mean, it's just so nuts!
[01:44:50.490 --> 01:44:52.051]  So if you care about the system,
[01:44:52.851 --> 01:44:56.076]  That your ancestors created, and which was the envy of the world.
[01:44:56.156 --> 01:45:00.862]  I mean, half the world, more than half the world, modeled their democracies after our democracy.
[01:45:00.882 --> 01:45:08.352]  So if your democracy is erased because people don't like Trump, it's kind of a profound change, not just in your country, but in the world.
[01:45:09.293 --> 01:45:12.135]  And that's not a good change, and you just don't want that.
[01:45:12.155 --> 01:45:15.117]  So I absolutely hope that it plays out that way.
[01:45:15.197 --> 01:45:25.424]  I guess part of what I was saying is I don't believe with Trump up eight points or whatever he is now over Biden in the face of four indictments, facing life in prison for non-crimes.
[01:45:26.124 --> 01:45:30.248]  The more you know that, the more it defies belief, and I think Conrad Black can explain it fairly well.
[01:45:31.909 --> 01:45:33.150]  He's still leading Joe Biden.
[01:45:33.931 --> 01:45:39.396]  So if the point of the Democratic Party is to hold power, there's nothing ideological with the Democratic Party.
[01:45:39.436 --> 01:45:41.277]  The idea is we should have the power and you shouldn't.
[01:45:41.437 --> 01:45:41.858]  That's it.
[01:45:43.039 --> 01:45:47.703]  They're about to lose power to Trump because Biden is so demonstrably incompetent.
[01:45:49.014 --> 01:45:52.055]  And they're going to make a change of some kind.
[01:45:53.075 --> 01:45:53.835]  That's not acceptable.
[01:45:54.615 --> 01:45:58.776]  So I don't know what that change is going to be, but I've spent my life living with them, so I know what they're like.
[01:45:59.376 --> 01:46:01.116]  And there will be a change.
[01:46:01.196 --> 01:46:03.577]  They will not lose to Trump if they can help it.
[01:46:03.677 --> 01:46:04.137]  And I mean it.
[01:46:04.217 --> 01:46:08.878]  And if that means replacing Biden or doing something unspeakable, they will do it.
[01:46:08.898 --> 01:46:10.338]  They're very serious about it.
[01:46:10.418 --> 01:46:13.759]  The other side is much more serious about power than normal people are.
[01:46:14.679 --> 01:46:18.220]  Normal people understand that power is, like, literally this is like a double-edged thing.
[01:46:19.324 --> 01:46:21.405]  It's nice to have it, but it can also destroy you.
[01:46:21.445 --> 01:46:23.507]  People are... They don't necessarily want power.
[01:46:23.627 --> 01:46:24.547]  I definitely don't want power.
[01:46:25.728 --> 01:46:28.950]  But a certain kind of hollow person needs it above all.
[01:46:28.970 --> 01:46:30.551]  So I just think, beware.
[01:46:30.571 --> 01:46:31.832]  They're capable of anything.
[01:46:33.353 --> 01:46:35.454]  And that's why you got the power, Tucker, is you're not looking for it.
[01:46:35.654 --> 01:46:37.175]  So let's put that image back on screen.
[01:46:38.436 --> 01:46:45.721]  If you want to know what keeps King Charles and Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and Hillary Clinton up at night, it's that.
[01:46:47.132 --> 01:46:49.675]  30, 40, 50,000 people in Calgary?
[01:46:49.695 --> 01:46:52.257]  He's doing a tour up there?
[01:46:55.960 --> 01:46:57.422]  And he goes to Europe, similar numbers?
[01:46:57.442 --> 01:47:02.046]  How do you think Rupert Murdoch feels now getting the order to fire him?
[01:47:03.308 --> 01:47:03.848]  We're good to go.
[01:47:31.343 --> 01:47:32.143]  I mean, look at those shots.
[01:47:32.244 --> 01:47:33.564]  Way up in the nosebleeds.
[01:47:33.904 --> 01:47:34.165]  Full.
[01:47:38.147 --> 01:47:40.648]  So if you want to see what victory looks like, it's that.
[01:47:41.789 --> 01:47:43.210]  And imagine being the globalist.
[01:47:44.450 --> 01:47:45.171]  And they're seeing that.
[01:47:45.511 --> 01:47:48.713]  I mean, Bill Gates can't get 10 people out to hear him, or they all hate him.
[01:47:49.253 --> 01:47:50.194]  Neither can Klaus Schwab.
[01:47:50.214 --> 01:47:53.215]  Neither can Yuval Noah Harari.
[01:47:54.316 --> 01:47:55.036]  Or, oh, Biden.
[01:47:56.817 --> 01:47:57.538]  And they see that.
[01:47:59.039 --> 01:47:59.679]  What does that say?
[01:47:59.739 --> 01:48:05.463]  But everybody on the fence who's political, who's worked for the system, they don't totally serve the New World Order.
[01:48:05.483 --> 01:48:06.804]  They don't even like it, but they're scared.
[01:48:07.264 --> 01:48:09.145]  They see that and they go, wow, that's popular.
[01:48:09.686 --> 01:48:10.586]  I should join that.
[01:48:11.126 --> 01:48:12.127]  I should be part of that.
[01:48:13.948 --> 01:48:15.729]  All right, we got loaded phone lines.
[01:48:15.789 --> 01:48:22.794]  James, Christian, Curtis, Jennifer, John, Amanda, Billy, Ian, Michael, Paul in Hawaii.
[01:48:23.114 --> 01:48:27.256]  We're going to go to all your calls in the order that they were received.
[01:48:28.263 --> 01:48:31.024]  So let's start at the top with James in Oklahoma.
[01:48:31.044 --> 01:48:35.925]  James, your view on the 14 states back in Texas, seven of them sending troops.
[01:48:36.425 --> 01:48:37.665]  What do you think the deep state does next?
[01:48:38.606 --> 01:48:40.906]  Well, thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[01:48:40.966 --> 01:48:41.846]  I really appreciate it.
[01:48:42.266 --> 01:48:44.607]  Kind of nervous, so I'm going to try to keep my composure.
[01:48:45.227 --> 01:48:49.208]  But this is a necessary escalation, right?
[01:48:50.288 --> 01:48:51.309]  It is an escalation.
[01:48:51.489 --> 01:48:53.889]  All these states saying no to the federal government.
[01:48:53.909 --> 01:48:56.430]  It's a massive, beautiful, beautiful escalation.
[01:48:57.321 --> 01:48:59.783]  Yes, it's very, very, very necessary.
[01:48:59.803 --> 01:49:08.369]  22 million people plus, who knows the real number at this point, have come into our country, and we've been on our heels for a long time.
[01:49:08.669 --> 01:49:12.752]  We're finally digging into the dirt and taking steps forward, and it feels good to win, man.
[01:49:13.312 --> 01:49:15.914]  Well, imagine if the states were doing the right thing.
[01:49:16.875 --> 01:49:17.976]  I know, man.
[01:49:18.156 --> 01:49:20.998]  Kevin Stitt, our governor, he stood with them.
[01:49:21.613 --> 01:49:23.875]  I immediately got on his Twitter and started supporting him.
[01:49:24.655 --> 01:49:27.237]  Well, I can tell you behind the scenes, it's the donor class.
[01:49:27.257 --> 01:49:30.699]  Because most Republican donors aren't globalists, but they still go along with the system.
[01:49:31.119 --> 01:49:35.362]  I can tell you all the money, except the top ones, is saying no to this.
[01:49:35.382 --> 01:49:37.263]  Because they can see this is a takeover of the country.
[01:49:38.224 --> 01:49:38.964]  That's good, man.
[01:49:39.064 --> 01:49:42.867]  Even though they, like, some, you know, enemy of my enemy sometimes.
[01:49:42.887 --> 01:49:43.847]  You know what I mean?
[01:49:43.887 --> 01:49:45.228]  Well, it's beyond that.
[01:49:45.248 --> 01:49:47.570]  I mean, there's a lot of establishment people that realize, wait.
[01:49:48.937 --> 01:49:49.918]  The old game's over.
[01:49:50.979 --> 01:49:52.340]  You better choose a side right now.
[01:49:53.521 --> 01:49:56.163]  What do you make of Tucker and these gigantic crowds in Canada?
[01:49:57.043 --> 01:49:58.064]  Oh, it's awesome, man.
[01:49:58.124 --> 01:50:00.686]  Remember when Tucker said, we're going to liberate Canada?
[01:50:01.227 --> 01:50:02.448]  That's the first steps right there.
[01:50:02.468 --> 01:50:02.868]  You see it.
[01:50:03.428 --> 01:50:09.153]  And again, they tried to stop 20,000, 30,000 protesters with the convoy.
[01:50:09.433 --> 01:50:10.294]  How do they feel now?
[01:50:10.594 --> 01:50:11.795]  How's their intimidation now?
[01:50:12.055 --> 01:50:14.157]  And now the federal courts ruled against Trudeau.
[01:50:15.898 --> 01:50:16.979]  Man, it's going to be...
[01:50:17.631 --> 01:50:19.432]  These next few years are going to be crazy.
[01:50:19.832 --> 01:50:21.453]  I'm just so happy I'm alive during it.
[01:50:22.894 --> 01:50:23.535]  I agree, brother.
[01:50:23.795 --> 01:50:24.475]  Absolutely.
[01:50:24.935 --> 01:50:25.996]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:50:26.076 --> 01:50:26.596]  Great points.
[01:50:27.177 --> 01:50:29.038]  Michael in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[01:50:29.078 --> 01:50:29.378]  Welcome.
[01:50:30.859 --> 01:50:31.239]  Hi, Alex.
[01:50:31.259 --> 01:50:31.960]  Great to talk to you.
[01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:32.340]  Yes, sir.
[01:50:34.301 --> 01:50:37.383]  I think we should let nature handle this problem.
[01:50:37.903 --> 01:50:43.126]  Every day that they let 800 people into this country, we should turn 800 alligators loose in that river.
[01:50:45.628 --> 01:50:47.249]  See how fast they stop coming across.
[01:50:48.541 --> 01:50:50.942]  Well, I don't think we've got anybody that can wrangle 800 alligators.
[01:50:50.962 --> 01:50:54.924]  You know, the people being brought in are refugees from globalist policies of the lockdown.
[01:50:55.325 --> 01:50:56.145]  I'm not even their enemy.
[01:50:56.165 --> 01:50:57.226]  They're just being used as a weapon.
[01:50:57.266 --> 01:50:59.427]  But seriously, what else is on your mind, Michael?
[01:51:00.187 --> 01:51:02.869]  I just think that they're going to form it and make an army against us.
[01:51:03.849 --> 01:51:05.030]  I think that's what their plan is.
[01:51:05.230 --> 01:51:08.832]  At some point in time, they're going to blow the whistle and they're going to congregate and do it.
[01:51:09.612 --> 01:51:15.676]  Well, they're all giving government phones and NGO phones, and they are announcing illegal aliens will be the new military and police.
[01:51:15.716 --> 01:51:16.536]  So that's actually true.
[01:51:16.556 --> 01:51:17.857]  That's not speculation.
[01:51:18.854 --> 01:51:22.256]  I'm just concerned with my family and my grandkids and everybody else.
[01:51:24.297 --> 01:51:25.418]  Brother, I'm concerned too.
[01:51:25.538 --> 01:51:28.420]  Are you heartened by the 14 states lining up with Texas?
[01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:29.800]  I love it.
[01:51:30.041 --> 01:51:35.024]  I wish North Carolina would jump in there, but unfortunately our governor is blue.
[01:51:36.324 --> 01:51:37.365]  Thank you so much, Michael.
[01:51:37.865 --> 01:51:39.186]  Let's talk to folks in Hawaii.
[01:51:39.226 --> 01:51:40.627]  Paul in Hawaii, what's your view on this?
[01:51:42.668 --> 01:51:43.188]  Hi, Alex.
[01:51:43.549 --> 01:51:44.449]  I agree 100% with what...
[01:51:46.215 --> 01:51:47.336]  What Texas is doing.
[01:51:47.576 --> 01:51:49.317]  I think they have every right to do that.
[01:51:49.638 --> 01:51:51.299]  I think every state should be doing it.
[01:51:53.100 --> 01:52:00.066]  I've heard that in Massachusetts, they want to allow people to live in the homes, and they're asking citizens to let them into their homes.
[01:52:00.526 --> 01:52:00.706]  Yeah.
[01:52:00.926 --> 01:52:05.730]  I believe there is a law that's against soldiers living in homes.
[01:52:05.810 --> 01:52:06.231]  That's right.
[01:52:06.271 --> 01:52:07.892]  There's a law that's quartering troops.
[01:52:07.912 --> 01:52:08.953]  That's in the Bill of Rights.
[01:52:09.413 --> 01:52:10.854]  And now we're quartering illegal aliens.
[01:52:12.415 --> 01:52:13.236]  And these people are.
[01:52:13.476 --> 01:52:14.337]  They're going to be troops.
[01:52:15.213 --> 01:52:20.075]  Mark Anthony said that you can judge a tyrant because he sits at a table with foreigners.
[01:52:20.515 --> 01:52:21.916]  He doesn't trust his own kind.
[01:52:22.336 --> 01:52:25.457]  That's how Rome eventually fell was bringing in illegal aliens.
[01:52:26.917 --> 01:52:27.978]  Yeah.
[01:52:28.058 --> 01:52:28.678]  It's a ditto.
[01:52:29.378 --> 01:52:30.419]  I've seen it in Europe.
[01:52:30.499 --> 01:52:31.979]  I've seen what's happened over the years.
[01:52:32.059 --> 01:52:33.960]  I've done business over there for years.
[01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:36.801]  And it's really sad.
[01:52:37.481 --> 01:52:41.402]  And the people in charge, like you say, they're digging their bunkers like Mark Zuckerberg here.
[01:52:41.983 --> 01:52:42.963]  Just a side note.
[01:52:43.813 --> 01:52:57.745]  I haven't seen any federally required literature on the structural geology on what he's building or the geological aspects of the hydrology of the island of Kauai.
[01:52:57.765 --> 01:52:58.385]  Well, that's right.
[01:52:58.405 --> 01:53:01.388]  They use hydrology to not let anybody build, as you said.
[01:53:01.408 --> 01:53:02.869]  They use these weird water rules.
[01:53:02.909 --> 01:53:05.611]  But I've noticed, I actually heard that from engineers while I was there.
[01:53:05.631 --> 01:53:06.853]  He's not following any of the permitting.
[01:53:08.594 --> 01:53:09.675]  Well, there's federal laws.
[01:53:11.027 --> 01:53:13.548]  There was a book, I think it was written by Rutherford Platt.
[01:53:13.888 --> 01:53:19.291]  He was on the commission back in the 80s regarding building its coastal policy.
[01:53:19.311 --> 01:53:19.971]  You can look it up.
[01:53:20.031 --> 01:53:28.174]  I'm sure they're breaking a lot of federal laws, but I'm sure some of those laws are probably lax because of the state of Hawaii being basically a coastal location.
[01:53:28.694 --> 01:53:29.215]  Well, think about this.
[01:53:29.235 --> 01:53:29.775]  Think about this.
[01:53:29.795 --> 01:53:30.455]  Yeah, think about this.
[01:53:33.953 --> 01:53:37.296]  The globalists steal everything, set up a society so dangerous they all build bunkers.
[01:53:37.997 --> 01:53:41.099]  Why would they be good stewards of things and build a society where they didn't need bunkers?
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:42.200]  It's so stupid!
[01:53:44.222 --> 01:53:48.226]  Well, not only that, it's like they go out in public and they surround themselves with security guards.
[01:53:48.306 --> 01:53:50.508]  I mean, I guess people really want to go after them.
[01:53:50.528 --> 01:53:51.489]  I guess it's crazy.
[01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:56.854]  If you've got that much vitriolic issue with people, you would think that you're doing something wrong.
[01:53:57.674 --> 01:53:59.536]  I guess they can't look in the mirror and reflect.
[01:53:59.596 --> 01:54:00.457]  That's the real issue.
[01:54:00.962 --> 01:54:04.363]  And that has to do with the spiritual aspect that you always speak to, Alex.
[01:54:04.923 --> 01:54:08.405]  Well, they're talking about, Paul, a political realignment in Hawaii.
[01:54:08.685 --> 01:54:09.625]  Is Hawaii waking up?
[01:54:11.926 --> 01:54:13.406]  Unfortunately, we aren't.
[01:54:14.707 --> 01:54:16.207]  You've seen what happened in Maui.
[01:54:16.587 --> 01:54:18.248]  That's been really quelled.
[01:54:18.788 --> 01:54:24.630]  I guess they're really dragging their feet, the insurance companies, to steal the land.
[01:54:24.930 --> 01:54:30.292]  I think what I heard is the people, a lot of the boys that might do something are being paid off.
[01:54:31.149 --> 01:54:36.271]  I think it's all about pay for play, which I think the Chinese learned early on.
[01:54:36.751 --> 01:54:40.752]  You know, I witnessed that when they took over the pharmaceutical company.
[01:54:40.812 --> 01:54:45.394]  A friend of mine used to be the president of the largest pharmaceutical company in Spain.
[01:54:45.414 --> 01:54:51.556]  And I asked him what was the biggest problem, and he said cross-contamination of drugs.
[01:54:52.076 --> 01:54:58.158]  And about three years later, I saw him in Germany at a meeting, and I asked him how he was doing.
[01:54:58.178 --> 01:54:58.998]  He said he retired.
[01:54:59.437 --> 01:55:00.998]  They sold the company to China.
[01:55:01.698 --> 01:55:08.100]  And I said, well, what do you think about that problem with contamination that you told me about where about 10% of the product was no good?
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:12.302]  And he said, well, they're probably selling it to Europe and the United States.
[01:55:12.582 --> 01:55:13.182]  Absolutely.
[01:55:13.222 --> 01:55:14.143]  Thank you, Paul.
[01:55:14.583 --> 01:55:14.883]  Thank you.
[01:55:14.923 --> 01:55:15.383]  God bless you.
[01:55:15.403 --> 01:55:15.843]  Great points.
[01:55:16.283 --> 01:55:17.944]  Amanda in South Carolina, you're on the air.
[01:55:17.964 --> 01:55:18.304]  Go ahead.
[01:55:19.625 --> 01:55:20.205]  Hey, darling.
[01:55:20.645 --> 01:55:20.885]  Hey.
[01:55:22.426 --> 01:55:27.828]  I want to call on Governor Henry McMaster to get up off his hands and get behind Texas.
[01:55:29.926 --> 01:55:31.587]  14 governors have.
[01:55:31.648 --> 01:55:32.448]  Your governor hasn't?
[01:55:33.869 --> 01:55:34.150]  No.
[01:55:34.530 --> 01:55:41.837]  He's always... It wasn't even a month ago these legal gas station drugs were killing people.
[01:55:42.497 --> 01:55:46.040]  Georgia and North Carolina passed laws to put bans on those.
[01:55:46.180 --> 01:55:48.603]  And I'm hearing crickets in South Carolina.
[01:55:50.784 --> 01:55:56.830]  Well, I've got to check my map because my map says South Carolina's joined Texas, but I'll check that.
[01:55:58.010 --> 01:56:01.832]  I hope he has, but I'm calling on him if he happens to do it.
[01:56:02.993 --> 01:56:03.393]  Beautiful.
[01:56:03.413 --> 01:56:04.194]  Anything else on your mind?
[01:56:04.214 --> 01:56:06.215]  No, I appreciate it.
[01:56:06.856 --> 01:56:07.636]  I appreciate you.
[01:56:07.656 --> 01:56:09.457]  I love Southerners.
[01:56:09.537 --> 01:56:12.699]  It makes people mad everywhere else a woman calls you darling or sweetheart.
[01:56:15.381 --> 01:56:17.062]  The Lakers always gets a bigger tip when they do that, though.
[01:56:17.562 --> 01:56:19.003]  Let's talk to Ian in Texas.
[01:56:19.043 --> 01:56:19.724]  Ian, you're on the air.
[01:56:19.764 --> 01:56:20.044]  Go ahead.
[01:56:21.724 --> 01:56:24.065]  Yeah, Alex, it's great to talk to you.
[01:56:24.286 --> 01:56:27.527]  Long-time listener, first-time caller, multi-decades.
[01:56:28.828 --> 01:56:34.592]  But I wanted to let you know, first off, you need to check out, it's an old movie from HBO, 1997.
[01:56:35.572 --> 01:56:38.014]  It's called The Second Civil War.
[01:56:38.614 --> 01:56:41.996]  It's with Bo Bridges, Bill Hartman, and Dennis Leary.
[01:56:42.516 --> 01:56:50.261]  This, of course, it's a hokey kind of storyline with it, but because it's HBO, but
[01:56:51.036 --> 01:56:53.218]  Isn't it incredible the times we're living in?
[01:57:02.992 --> 01:57:04.433]  Oh, this is nuts.
[01:57:04.653 --> 01:57:11.135]  I mean, my family has been involved in every single, well, almost every single war this country's ever had.
[01:57:11.235 --> 01:57:24.821]  From, you know, two Minutemen to a captain that got a sword directly from Washington to a great-grandfather going up the hill with Teddy Roosevelt, San Juan Hill.
[01:57:25.701 --> 01:57:28.022]  Both sides of the Civil War.
[01:57:28.402 --> 01:57:29.923]  My father, a Marine Corps soldier,
[01:57:30.647 --> 01:57:34.089]  A Navy corpsman with Marine Corps stationed with the 3rd Fleet Marines.
[01:57:35.050 --> 01:57:37.852]  My other grandfather worked on the atomic bomb.
[01:57:37.892 --> 01:57:39.093]  Hold on, we've got to go to break, Ian.
[01:57:39.133 --> 01:57:39.633]  Don't hang up.
[01:57:39.693 --> 01:57:41.034]  Back in two minutes, we'll let you finish up.
[01:57:41.534 --> 01:57:42.975]  Yeah, historic stuff happening.
[01:57:43.015 --> 01:57:44.376]  Hour number three, straight ahead.
[01:57:44.396 --> 01:57:45.297]  Stay with us.
[01:57:48.663 --> 01:57:52.946]  99 years on air, all I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalists.
[01:57:53.647 --> 01:57:58.990]  And I've done the best job I can to tell those words that have been accurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[01:57:59.370 --> 01:58:01.912]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves.
[01:58:02.332 --> 01:58:06.735]  Unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people, we don't do that.
[01:58:07.195 --> 01:58:09.077]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[01:58:09.457 --> 01:58:11.478]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product.
[01:58:11.518 --> 01:58:12.099]  It's so powerful.
[01:58:13.019 --> 01:58:18.021]  This is the breakdown product, after your cells process it, of folic acid.
[01:58:18.602 --> 01:58:23.064]  Methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[01:58:23.544 --> 01:58:24.764]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[01:58:24.804 --> 01:58:25.665]  It's not a stimulant.
[01:58:25.925 --> 01:58:27.726]  It energizes your cells.
[01:58:28.246 --> 01:58:28.926]  Winter is coming.
[01:58:28.946 --> 01:58:29.607]  Winter is coming.
[01:58:29.647 --> 01:58:30.587]  Winter is coming.
[01:58:30.627 --> 01:58:31.328]  Winter is coming.
[01:58:55.825 --> 01:58:57.325]  Winter is coming.
[01:58:57.625 --> 01:58:59.026]  Winter isn't coming.
[01:58:59.606 --> 01:59:00.886]  Winter is here.
[01:59:01.286 --> 01:59:08.788]  And while the sun isn't helping us produce as much vitamin D, do yourself a favor and try InfoWars Life Winter Sun Plus.

[02:00:07.756 --> 02:00:09.917]  You know, we're sitting here watching history.
[02:00:09.937 --> 02:00:11.158]  Now it's 15 states.
[02:00:11.178 --> 02:00:12.378]  The article's on Empower.com.
[02:00:12.418 --> 02:00:14.159]  They're printing it off of it right now.
[02:00:14.479 --> 02:00:17.041]  Now 15 states have lined up behind Texas.
[02:00:18.041 --> 02:00:18.381]  Wow.
[02:00:18.562 --> 02:00:20.282]  History is happening now.
[02:00:20.583 --> 02:00:21.443]  Will this save everything?
[02:00:21.503 --> 02:00:25.865]  No, but it's teaching us to stand up and do the right thing and unify with each other.
[02:00:26.526 --> 02:00:30.388]  All right, Ian, you were getting your family back around the military, but we're moving past that now.
[02:00:30.968 --> 02:00:32.069]  You were saying history's happening.
[02:00:32.089 --> 02:00:32.749]  What was your other point?
[02:00:34.383 --> 02:00:37.445]  Yeah, no, history's happening so incredibly fast.
[02:00:37.785 --> 02:00:50.454]  And I think, honestly, the globalists, the only thing they have left, because the momentum is too big, the wave is too big, it's going to smash in just like it did on the Marshall Islands with that giant wave recently.
[02:00:51.315 --> 02:00:57.118]  They're going to go ahead and they're going to try and either arrest people or they're going to try and attack.
[02:00:57.619 --> 02:00:59.600]  That's the only thing I think they have left.
[02:01:00.741 --> 02:01:03.403]  Yeah, and if they attack, they get in trouble, so they're going to stage a false flag.
[02:01:04.690 --> 02:01:06.271]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:01:06.551 --> 02:01:15.915]  It's not going to be pretty, but hey, we had to be quitters, I guess you could say, in 1776, and we started our own.
[02:01:16.075 --> 02:01:19.776]  We had to be quitters in 1836 to start our own.
[02:01:20.236 --> 02:01:23.658]  You know, I'm calling from FEMA Region 6 as well over here in Kerrville.
[02:01:24.478 --> 02:01:25.438]  I ain't backing down.
[02:01:25.619 --> 02:01:33.682]  I took down my American flag and put up my Texas flag just because I'll put up the American flag when we're free again.
[02:01:34.858 --> 02:01:35.358]  Well, that's right.
[02:01:35.638 --> 02:01:37.840]  The American flag really is captured at this point.
[02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:40.381]  And so I guess the only way to fly it would be upside down.
[02:01:40.441 --> 02:01:40.981]  Thank you, Ian.
[02:01:41.542 --> 02:01:43.623]  It's not because we're mad at America or ashamed of America.
[02:01:43.643 --> 02:01:44.723]  We've got to be honest where we're at.
[02:01:45.184 --> 02:01:46.524]  That's why you fly flags upside down.
[02:01:47.305 --> 02:01:48.565]  And people say, oh, that's disrespectful.
[02:01:48.605 --> 02:01:49.686]  No, that's where your country's at.
[02:01:50.006 --> 02:01:51.427]  You fly it upside down when you're in distress.
[02:01:52.107 --> 02:01:53.068]  Christian in Florida.
[02:01:53.088 --> 02:01:53.648]  Thanks for calling.
[02:01:53.668 --> 02:01:54.269]  Go ahead, Christian.
[02:01:55.629 --> 02:01:56.190]  Hey, Alex.
[02:01:56.230 --> 02:01:57.270]  Good to talk to you, sir.
[02:01:57.530 --> 02:01:59.271]  Long-time listener, first-time caller.
[02:01:59.972 --> 02:02:03.033]  I've been listening to you since the days of Aaron Russo.
[02:02:03.313 --> 02:02:04.294]  That way, that far back.
[02:02:05.287 --> 02:02:08.068]  Just, you know, it seems to me like everything's going to plan.
[02:02:08.088 --> 02:02:12.349]  This is the architects, the big new Brzezinski and Henry Kissinger.
[02:02:12.389 --> 02:02:19.031]  This is replacement migration, as you've said a thousand times, in concert with the collapse of our currency.
[02:02:19.051 --> 02:02:26.012]  You know, with the formation of the BRICS and reaching critical mass, there's no longer use for the dollar.
[02:02:26.052 --> 02:02:28.053]  We don't trade in oil for the dollar.
[02:02:28.913 --> 02:02:31.734]  And now it's just basically fiat currency that's backed by
[02:02:32.409 --> 02:02:33.049]  The U.S.
[02:02:33.089 --> 02:02:33.730]  military.
[02:02:34.170 --> 02:02:37.251]  That being said, I think that this is the false flag.
[02:02:37.311 --> 02:02:43.914]  The replacement migration, the collapse of the dollar, and then, you know, absolute bedlam around the country.
[02:02:43.934 --> 02:02:56.579]  I believe it was said a long time ago that our own government would be the ones that begged the blue helmets to come in to put us down, because we're going to revolt once we've discovered we've been...
[02:02:57.679 --> 02:02:59.980]  We've been absolutely betrayed.
[02:03:00.501 --> 02:03:01.121]  Well, that's right.
[02:03:01.141 --> 02:03:06.544]  The setup is triggering the Civil War, which they push us into, even if it's a peaceful one, they're going to call it violent.
[02:03:06.864 --> 02:03:09.165]  That's why we've got all the movies coming out, everything ready for this.
[02:03:09.285 --> 02:03:09.625]  I agree.
[02:03:09.966 --> 02:03:15.248]  They put us into a no-win situation where we've got to stand up to them.
[02:03:16.009 --> 02:03:16.749]  But here's the good news.
[02:03:16.789 --> 02:03:17.710]  People are seeing through it.
[02:03:18.010 --> 02:03:19.891]  If people see the bigger plan, it won't work.
[02:03:22.153 --> 02:03:23.293]  Yes, sir, absolutely.
[02:03:23.493 --> 02:03:26.174]  And, you know, this is tactical.
[02:03:26.234 --> 02:03:27.255]  It's cloward and pittin'.
[02:03:28.635 --> 02:03:36.458]  I really think if we can get to the election, we're going to need President Trump to get General Flynn, Kash Patel, Matt Gaetz.
[02:03:37.186 --> 02:03:40.248]  AOC went in worth nothing, which is worth like $20 million now?
[02:03:57.529 --> 02:03:58.249]  Right, exactly.
[02:03:58.269 --> 02:04:02.992]  Well, and the same thing, you know, I've said for a long time that Ukraine is nothing but high-tech money laundering.
[02:04:03.812 --> 02:04:13.516]  You know, the money goes to Ukraine and then it comes back in political packs to, you know, the Chuckie Schumers and the Turtle McConnells and the rest of them.
[02:04:13.576 --> 02:04:16.198]  And now they've bitten off more than they can chew.
[02:04:18.208 --> 02:04:18.649]  Yes, sir.
[02:04:18.729 --> 02:04:20.512]  We need a revival of the Republic.
[02:04:20.532 --> 02:04:24.718]  We need our people to hit their knees and ask the Almighty for forgiveness.
[02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:27.662]  And we really got to grab the...
[02:04:28.533 --> 02:04:31.254]  The bull by the horns, or we will lose this great country.
[02:04:31.294 --> 02:04:33.595]  And this is the shining city on the hill.
[02:04:33.635 --> 02:04:35.496]  It's the best house in a bad neighborhood.
[02:04:35.556 --> 02:04:38.057]  Yeah, they want this model gone for their new world order.
[02:04:38.077 --> 02:04:39.378]  Thank you so much, Christian.
[02:04:39.898 --> 02:04:41.979]  All right, Billy and others.
[02:04:41.999 --> 02:04:42.579]  60-second break.
[02:04:42.659 --> 02:04:43.560]  I'm coming in hot.
[02:04:44.060 --> 02:04:46.221]  Right back to your phone calls, however you're listening.

[02:06:22.127 --> 02:06:23.848]  Drew Hernandez coming up.
[02:06:24.589 --> 02:06:32.715]  Now 15 states joining Texas to say no to Biden and his criminal activity dissolving the border.
[02:06:34.758 --> 02:06:36.399]  We've got more on that coming up.
[02:06:38.140 --> 02:06:43.023]  Very, very exciting time to be alive right now.
[02:06:45.444 --> 02:06:49.146]  Now we've got Arkansas joining in with the other states.
[02:06:50.387 --> 02:06:52.248]  Let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls.
[02:06:52.348 --> 02:06:53.509]  Billy in California.
[02:06:53.549 --> 02:06:54.229]  Billy, you're on the air.
[02:06:54.249 --> 02:06:54.609]  Go ahead.
[02:06:54.629 --> 02:06:56.390]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:06:56.771 --> 02:07:00.253]  First time caller, long time listener from California.
[02:07:00.853 --> 02:07:02.574]  You know, Alex, I think we're being set up
[02:07:03.348 --> 02:07:06.250]  Honestly, I think we're playing right into the hands of the elite.
[02:07:07.932 --> 02:07:08.372]  Well, tell me.
[02:07:09.553 --> 02:07:14.597]  Yeah, no, I mean, you know, what do these people really want to do?
[02:07:14.757 --> 02:07:17.319]  They want to bring down the United States.
[02:07:17.720 --> 02:07:20.101]  They want to break the Constitution.
[02:07:20.282 --> 02:07:22.463]  You've been talking about this for 30 years, Alex.
[02:07:23.204 --> 02:07:24.345]  This is the key.
[02:07:24.785 --> 02:07:31.871]  Everything that you've been talking about, everything that they're doing right now is to bring down this country because...
[02:07:32.406 --> 02:07:40.990]  They can't move forward with their CBDCs, their one-world government, if the United States is still around.
[02:07:41.010 --> 02:07:42.511]  It doesn't matter who's president.
[02:07:43.232 --> 02:07:49.595]  As long as we are the foundation of freedom, they cannot continue forward.
[02:07:49.695 --> 02:07:55.178]  Sure, so the state's standing up and saying the federal government's hijacked and saying we're going to defend the border?
[02:07:55.198 --> 02:07:58.599]  I mean, the division's already there.
[02:07:58.920 --> 02:08:01.361]  How is that bad to have them follow their constitutional duty?
[02:08:02.338 --> 02:08:08.220]  Because, no, what Texas is doing and what the state's standing up, I'm all for that.
[02:08:08.440 --> 02:08:10.241]  That's not what I'm saying.
[02:08:10.261 --> 02:08:12.081]  Oh, definitely breaking the borders and the U.N.
[02:08:12.161 --> 02:08:14.422]  and all this is definitely how they're trying.
[02:08:14.462 --> 02:08:14.862]  I mean, I agree.
[02:08:14.882 --> 02:08:15.262]  That's true.
[02:08:16.383 --> 02:08:19.544]  You know, I just think that their ultimate goal...
[02:08:20.610 --> 02:08:26.334]  Yeah, but the feds are already breaking up the United States.
[02:08:26.394 --> 02:08:29.176]  So these states aren't getting together to say break up the U.S.
[02:08:29.497 --> 02:08:30.998]  They're saying the federal government's out of control.
[02:08:31.038 --> 02:08:33.259]  They're standing up for national sovereignty, actually.
[02:08:33.800 --> 02:08:34.740]  No, I agree.
[02:08:34.760 --> 02:08:35.461]  I agree 100%.
[02:08:36.642 --> 02:08:42.165]  But I just think that is their goal, is to get us to fight amongst one another.
[02:08:42.766 --> 02:08:46.248]  And then the ultimate goal is to divide the United States.
[02:08:46.609 --> 02:08:48.810]  Yeah, well, that's what the race stuff's about in all of it.
[02:08:48.850 --> 02:08:49.291]  That's true.
[02:08:49.391 --> 02:08:49.551]  So...
[02:08:51.052 --> 02:08:53.134]  I mean, I don't think that's what you think.
[02:08:53.194 --> 02:08:54.094]  I think that's known.
[02:08:54.555 --> 02:08:59.318]  But states coming together and saying we're going to defend the border and stand together, that's unity in the country.
[02:08:59.338 --> 02:09:01.380]  That's the opposite of division.
[02:09:01.700 --> 02:09:03.041]  Believe me, they're not happy about this.
[02:09:04.422 --> 02:09:07.925]  I think their ultimate goal is for us to be in a civil war.
[02:09:08.685 --> 02:09:14.310]  Well, no, clearly they want a civil war, but this isn't a civil war to have the states say we're going to protect the border.
[02:09:14.710 --> 02:09:17.072]  It calls out the fact that the federal government is completely criminal.
[02:09:18.129 --> 02:09:18.389]  Right.
[02:09:18.409 --> 02:09:26.255]  So, you know, I wanted to ask you this one question about, you know, Trump, you know, moving forward in all his court cases.
[02:09:26.775 --> 02:09:28.477]  I think they need a boogeyman.
[02:09:28.937 --> 02:09:34.941]  I think they need Biden as Neville Timberland, like they did, you know, pre-World War II.
[02:09:36.334 --> 02:09:41.536]  I don't think any of those guys are going to get assassinated, you know, maybe not until after the election.
[02:09:41.916 --> 02:09:46.778]  But I think they need the boogeyman and the fall guy going forward.
[02:09:47.258 --> 02:09:51.099]  And, you know, they always say never let a good crisis go to waste.
[02:09:51.939 --> 02:09:55.941]  You know, I've had this conversation with quite a few friends.
[02:09:56.001 --> 02:09:59.042]  I think they're going to flip the script in 2024.
[02:09:59.802 --> 02:10:00.342]  I really do.
[02:10:00.422 --> 02:10:04.524]  I think they're going to maybe rig a few machines saying...
[02:10:05.188 --> 02:10:12.418]  You know, Trump won by, because they know they can't defeat him because all the polls show that he is in such a big lead.
[02:10:12.819 --> 02:10:15.062]  Doesn't matter if they put Michelle Obama in.
[02:10:15.791 --> 02:10:17.472]  I think he would still crush her.
[02:10:36.639 --> 02:10:38.079]  Let's go to Jennifer in Tennessee.
[02:10:38.099 --> 02:10:38.980]  Jennifer, thanks for calling.
[02:10:39.020 --> 02:10:39.640]  Hey, Alex.
[02:11:04.188 --> 02:11:08.210]  I was just wondering on the topic of false flag, I think you're absolutely right.
[02:11:08.831 --> 02:11:20.619]  And I was wondering if you saw the interview from First Responder Media with somebody who just crossed over the border who said, if you're smart enough, you know who I am, but you're really not smart enough.
[02:11:20.779 --> 02:11:23.221]  Yeah, and it turns out he's like a major radical Islamic leader.
[02:11:23.241 --> 02:11:24.882]  Yeah, I saw that yesterday.
[02:11:24.902 --> 02:11:26.123]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:11:26.343 --> 02:11:30.926]  And I'm not seeing too many people put his information out there.
[02:11:31.047 --> 02:11:31.447]  And I think...
[02:11:32.313 --> 02:11:36.636]  One of the things that we can do as normal, everyday people... I'm in Tennessee.
[02:11:36.676 --> 02:11:39.818]  My state is supporting Texas, and I'm really happy about that.
[02:11:40.398 --> 02:11:46.282]  But one of the things that we can do as normal people is put that guy's face out there.
[02:11:46.302 --> 02:11:47.243]  I agree.
[02:11:47.403 --> 02:11:48.784]  I gave the crew the video yesterday.
[02:11:48.824 --> 02:11:49.504]  There it was.
[02:11:50.045 --> 02:11:56.068]  Was the illegal immigrant who made ominous remarks towards independent journalists identified as an Islamic leader just freed from prison?
[02:11:56.369 --> 02:11:57.549]  And it looks like he is.
[02:11:58.010 --> 02:11:59.030]  So, yeah, there's the report.
[02:11:59.050 --> 02:11:59.691]  It banned that video.
[02:12:01.041 --> 02:12:07.502]  Yeah, and I think it's very coincidental, the timing that he was released and then shows up right at our border.
[02:12:07.522 --> 02:12:10.643]  Oh, there's no doubt they're bringing a bunch of Hezbollah people in.
[02:12:10.963 --> 02:12:18.424]  And I said on October 7th, I said this is Hezbollah run, and they had a backroom deal with Israel and Hamas that was set up by Israel to do all this.
[02:12:18.824 --> 02:12:19.344]  That's a fact.
[02:12:19.645 --> 02:12:20.425]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:12:20.445 --> 02:12:21.025]  Yeah.
[02:12:21.625 --> 02:12:23.865]  Yeah, but I think we need to get that out there.
[02:12:23.965 --> 02:12:27.186]  I'm trying, but I'm still shadow banned on Twitter, so I can't.
[02:12:27.984 --> 02:12:30.385]  Well, you can take the article from man.video.
[02:12:30.405 --> 02:12:31.446]  You can share it on your email.
[02:12:33.047 --> 02:12:33.367]  I do.
[02:12:33.447 --> 02:12:34.388]  I share it everywhere.
[02:12:35.488 --> 02:12:38.290]  But I just think that we need to get his face out there.
[02:12:38.690 --> 02:12:44.173]  Because if people see him and they expose him and they're like, hey, look, forward this stuff.
[02:12:45.094 --> 02:12:52.398]  If they see, oh, crap, okay, this guy has been exposed, then maybe they'll be less likely to use him as a false flag.
[02:12:52.718 --> 02:12:55.640]  And if we do that often enough, it's going to make these false flag events worse.
[02:12:56.607 --> 02:12:58.491]  Less effective.
[02:12:58.511 --> 02:13:00.134]  I totally agree with you, Jennifer.
[02:13:00.175 --> 02:13:01.016]  Thank you so much for the call.
[02:13:01.417 --> 02:13:02.840]  We're moving quick to get to everybody here today.
[02:13:02.860 --> 02:13:04.584]  Let's go to Curtis in Florida.
[02:13:04.604 --> 02:13:05.025]  You're on the air.
[02:13:05.045 --> 02:13:05.666]  Go ahead.
[02:13:07.663 --> 02:13:09.365]  Mr. Jones, what an honor to speak to you.
[02:13:09.425 --> 02:13:11.066]  Honor's the same.
[02:13:11.086 --> 02:13:11.987]  Go ahead.
[02:13:12.107 --> 02:13:12.547]  Yes, sir.
[02:13:12.608 --> 02:13:14.269]  Back in 94 when it all started.
[02:13:14.729 --> 02:13:15.690]  But, yes, I'm 62.
[02:13:15.790 --> 02:13:16.891]  I live in Florida.
[02:13:16.911 --> 02:13:19.033]  I grew up in Missouri, or Misery, as we call it.
[02:13:19.814 --> 02:13:22.376]  But my dad was SAC, and he was just a farmer.
[02:13:23.537 --> 02:13:27.280]  And then he ended up with Strategic Air Command up in Goose Bay working with...
[02:13:28.201 --> 02:13:28.941]  With atom bombs.
[02:13:29.462 --> 02:13:37.665]  And then all my childhood, I was surrounded somehow by senators and governors and representatives and an ICBM missile down the road that my dad used to check on.
[02:13:37.805 --> 02:13:39.825]  And I was like, Dad, why are you going in there?
[02:13:39.865 --> 02:13:41.046]  How do you get in that gate?
[02:13:41.366 --> 02:13:42.666]  But I just wanted to give you a little background.
[02:13:42.726 --> 02:13:46.608]  And then when I was in high school, I started researching because I was in debate and ran across
[02:13:47.008 --> 02:13:51.792]  Of course, the CFR and the Trilateral Commission and Henry Kissinger and all that stuff, which opened my eyes.
[02:13:52.272 --> 02:13:54.794]  Now we're at this crucial point.
[02:13:55.195 --> 02:14:00.399]  I met Clarence Carter on a mountainside in Virginia.
[02:14:00.459 --> 02:14:03.701]  He was retiring from Microsoft and he owned a mountain.
[02:14:04.542 --> 02:14:07.204]  Kool & Gang used to do special events like that.
[02:14:07.244 --> 02:14:11.568]  Before the band started, I was sitting next to him just having a drink.
[02:14:11.948 --> 02:14:12.869]  Before the show started...
[02:14:13.960 --> 02:14:15.882]  And you understand.
[02:14:15.942 --> 02:14:16.822]  He's like me.
[02:14:16.902 --> 02:14:20.285]  He's met a lot of famous people and kind of surrounded by that.
[02:14:20.705 --> 02:14:21.746]  So it's not intimidating.
[02:14:21.786 --> 02:14:22.546]  It's just you're a person.
[02:14:23.447 --> 02:14:23.667]  Right?
[02:14:25.128 --> 02:14:27.090]  But I said, what about the Constitution and Bill of Rights?
[02:14:27.150 --> 02:14:28.611]  And he said, those days are long gone.
[02:14:28.631 --> 02:14:31.453]  And we kind of looked down at the ground, shook his head.
[02:14:31.473 --> 02:14:33.995]  I mean, his countenance changed.
[02:14:34.935 --> 02:14:36.897]  And I could tell it really hit him hard.
[02:14:36.917 --> 02:14:37.897]  And it was sincere.
[02:14:37.917 --> 02:14:39.519]  It's like I kind of stuck a knife in him.
[02:14:39.539 --> 02:14:40.079]  You know, it's just.
[02:14:40.894 --> 02:14:43.455]  So I just wanted you to know that about him, regardless.
[02:14:44.216 --> 02:14:48.097]  And I think he's under a lot of duress, but I always got the impression he was a good man.
[02:14:48.578 --> 02:14:54.140]  Well, yeah, there's a lot of people that know what's going on who never speak up and stand up because they think it's safer to do.
[02:14:54.601 --> 02:14:58.602]  I mean, look at all these big country music singers and people.
[02:14:58.943 --> 02:15:02.164]  Look at the big effect it had when Kid Rock shot up the Bud Light.
[02:15:02.784 --> 02:15:05.426]  Or all the great things that, you know, the...
[02:15:08.143 --> 02:15:10.064]  Motor City madman Ted Nugent's done.
[02:15:10.544 --> 02:15:15.045]  We had more Ted Nugents and less George Straits.
[02:15:15.085 --> 02:15:16.085]  And I'm not mad at George Straits.
[02:15:16.105 --> 02:15:16.765]  I love George Straits.
[02:15:17.045 --> 02:15:19.546]  But George Straits never says a political word anywhere.
[02:15:19.906 --> 02:15:23.747]  He just sits there and promotes Americana while the country's being killed.
[02:15:23.987 --> 02:15:25.008]  I'm not calling out George Straits.
[02:15:25.048 --> 02:15:26.588]  I just did it a few months ago or a month ago.
[02:15:26.988 --> 02:15:28.469]  I said, where are the George Straits of the world?
[02:15:28.489 --> 02:15:29.329]  Like, take Hank Williams Jr.
[02:15:30.149 --> 02:15:31.110]  He knows all about this.
[02:15:31.530 --> 02:15:34.691]  Well, he got, you know, for a while kicked off the NFL because he made some political comments.
[02:15:34.731 --> 02:15:35.151]  So what?
[02:15:35.972 --> 02:15:37.392]  Am I just singling out country music?
[02:15:37.472 --> 02:15:46.376]  I'm just saying we need people across the board, whether they're doctors or lawyers or military people, to speak up and say no now.
[02:15:46.816 --> 02:15:48.697]  Not just say, oh, those days are long gone.
[02:15:48.737 --> 02:15:50.098]  Well, then what are you accepting?
[02:15:50.458 --> 02:15:52.539]  Because by doing that, you're aiding, and I appreciate your call.
[02:15:53.059 --> 02:15:54.339]  Let's go to John in Texas.
[02:15:54.359 --> 02:15:55.040]  John, you're on the air.
[02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:55.340]  Go ahead.
[02:15:56.795 --> 02:15:57.295]  Hey, Alex.
[02:15:57.335 --> 02:15:57.976]  I love you, man.
[02:15:58.096 --> 02:15:59.217]  I'm not nervous.
[02:15:59.297 --> 02:16:00.278]  I'm just caffeinated.
[02:16:00.798 --> 02:16:17.331]  I've been thinking we should push for the state of Texas to arm our citizens, law-abiding citizens with AR-15s and a few hundred rounds per adult so we can defend ourselves in the event of some sort of Red Dawn event, which looks like it's very possibly going to come.
[02:16:18.251 --> 02:16:22.214]  Well, they were already in the globalist UN replacement migration Red Dawn event.
[02:16:22.734 --> 02:16:24.375]  And that's all fine with me.
[02:16:24.395 --> 02:16:25.296]  I think everybody should be armed.
[02:16:25.756 --> 02:16:28.558]  And we should bring back civil defense, the militias, and the Constitution.
[02:16:28.598 --> 02:16:32.981]  But more importantly, we know the UN camps that are funded by the State Department.
[02:16:33.461 --> 02:16:37.664]  We can have congressional hearings and have that funding pulled.
[02:16:39.085 --> 02:16:39.325]  Yeah.
[02:16:40.766 --> 02:16:41.026]  Go ahead.
[02:16:42.727 --> 02:16:44.048]  Oh, no, I'm just listening to you, man.
[02:16:44.769 --> 02:16:44.909]  Okay.
[02:16:45.069 --> 02:16:45.269]  Okay.
[02:16:46.345 --> 02:16:49.227]  Well, what do you think of now 15 states lining up behind Texas?
[02:16:50.568 --> 02:16:51.529]  I think it's awesome.
[02:16:51.569 --> 02:16:52.709]  I'm glad to see it out there.
[02:16:52.750 --> 02:16:55.511]  I'm surprised the news is even publishing it, to be honest.
[02:16:56.872 --> 02:16:57.733]  But I think it's great.
[02:16:57.773 --> 02:17:04.638]  I think we need all the backing we can to at least, you know, for a show of force to try and avoid more conflict.
[02:17:06.024 --> 02:17:06.464]  No, I agree.
[02:17:06.484 --> 02:17:08.585]  Look, there's a normalcy bias in government.
[02:17:08.965 --> 02:17:13.487]  We've been trained to put up with tyranny and corruption for so long, but now it's so outrageous.
[02:17:13.567 --> 02:17:14.507]  It's so over the top.
[02:17:14.848 --> 02:17:19.289]  The Democrats are using the cartels as their muscle, just like Carrie Lake got threatened with cartels.
[02:17:19.670 --> 02:17:20.890]  Now that guy's had to resign.
[02:17:21.410 --> 02:17:27.353]  There are a lot of people in the system that have been on the fence that are getting off of it and on our side right now.
[02:17:27.733 --> 02:17:30.834]  So we're entering a very serious time right now.
[02:17:32.215 --> 02:17:32.615]  Yes, sir.
[02:17:34.124 --> 02:17:34.705]  Thank you, John.
[02:17:35.225 --> 02:17:35.886]  Thank you, sir.
[02:17:36.466 --> 02:17:36.887]  Thank you.
[02:17:37.847 --> 02:17:40.250]  But yeah, everybody needs to be armed and ready to protect themselves.
[02:17:40.310 --> 02:17:47.617]  But that's kind of like trying to put the house out... When the house is on fire, trying to put the house out of fire.
[02:17:47.937 --> 02:17:49.598]  Trying to put out a fire once it's already started.
[02:17:50.339 --> 02:17:52.121]  I mean, it's policy.
[02:17:53.578 --> 02:18:02.002]  You shut off the State Department Monday, four run in the UN refugee centers, you get control of the Border Patrol, you impeach Mayorkas, and that's what's ongoing right now.
[02:18:02.602 --> 02:18:03.603]  Spencer in Florida.
[02:18:03.623 --> 02:18:03.963]  Go ahead.
[02:18:03.983 --> 02:18:04.483]  You're on the air.
[02:18:06.604 --> 02:18:07.124]  Hey, Alex.
[02:18:07.345 --> 02:18:10.706]  I just wanted to say God bless you and your team for everything you're doing.
[02:18:10.986 --> 02:18:11.507]  God bless you.
[02:18:11.527 --> 02:18:12.607]  I also love the products.
[02:18:12.747 --> 02:18:15.548]  I just got my Turbo 4 stuff in.
[02:18:16.669 --> 02:18:22.772]  Anyways, I have family in Marble Falls, so it's kind of close to home for us, but we're in Florida for me and my wife.
[02:18:23.547 --> 02:18:28.589]  And I was listening to Clayton Morris the other day, and he was interviewing Michael Yawn on Redacted.
[02:18:29.229 --> 02:18:35.512]  And I was curious on his take about Governor Abbott being a part of the WEF and what you thought about that.
[02:18:35.712 --> 02:18:37.453]  Yeah, I mean, I respect Michael Yawn.
[02:18:37.753 --> 02:18:42.895]  I don't think Abbott's officially part of it, but I think he thinks that the governor can't be trusted.
[02:18:42.915 --> 02:18:49.398]  And I mean, I don't trust him as far as I can throw him, but these actions are good actions, and I'm supporting these actions.
[02:18:50.503 --> 02:18:52.725]  Do you think he could have done it a little sooner, though?
[02:18:52.805 --> 02:18:56.448]  I feel like now he just kind of do it to showboat it.
[02:18:57.488 --> 02:18:59.110]  Well, I mean, are we going to back Texas now?
[02:18:59.130 --> 02:19:00.331]  All these other states are backing it.
[02:19:00.391 --> 02:19:01.031]  I mean, I'm backing it.
[02:19:03.333 --> 02:19:03.833]  Oh, of course.
[02:19:03.894 --> 02:19:04.354]  I've been ready.
[02:19:05.835 --> 02:19:09.398]  Well, look, this isn't going to save things either, but it's going to be action that is.
[02:19:10.319 --> 02:19:12.220]  And it's going to be people waking up to what's going on.
[02:19:12.881 --> 02:19:14.642]  Hell, guys, get Michael Young on tomorrow.
[02:19:15.383 --> 02:19:16.223]  Hell, call him right now.
[02:19:16.243 --> 02:19:16.864]  Get him on right now.
[02:19:18.097 --> 02:19:18.977]  We'll go to him right now.
[02:19:18.997 --> 02:19:20.137]  He can give us his take on Abbott.
[02:19:21.298 --> 02:19:23.778]  So, I mean, I've been a big critic of Abbott.
[02:19:23.798 --> 02:19:25.338]  He's been far from perfect.
[02:19:25.358 --> 02:19:29.759]  But we're under total disillusionment of our state.
[02:19:30.479 --> 02:19:31.780]  All the other states are backing us up.
[02:19:31.800 --> 02:19:32.640]  They're sending troops.
[02:19:33.080 --> 02:19:34.120]  They're defying the feds.
[02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:37.961]  And it's a very exciting thing.
[02:19:38.061 --> 02:19:40.461]  So we can say it's a day late, a dollar short.
[02:19:40.921 --> 02:19:43.302]  I'm just simply saying this is a big phenomenon.
[02:19:43.342 --> 02:19:44.342]  This is a big thing happening.
[02:19:46.451 --> 02:19:55.257]  Yeah, I was just curious, because he said he first-hand witnessed that he saw a National Guard pulling illegal aliens out of the water and pulling them up to the side versus returning them.
[02:19:56.617 --> 02:19:57.738]  Yeah, I know.
[02:19:57.798 --> 02:19:59.299]  It would be nice to have him on your show.
[02:20:00.720 --> 02:20:01.280]  Have who on?
[02:20:02.301 --> 02:20:02.841]  Michael Yon.
[02:20:03.262 --> 02:20:04.002]  He's on all the time.
[02:20:04.022 --> 02:20:09.386]  Oh, I was just saying the other day... Did you just hear me say, we'll get him on today?
[02:20:09.406 --> 02:20:11.067]  Yes, sir.
[02:20:11.147 --> 02:20:12.808]  Alright, thanks for your call.
[02:20:12.828 --> 02:20:12.888]  Um...
[02:20:14.761 --> 02:20:18.897]  What do you do when you're the state guard down there and there's women and children drowning in the water?
[02:20:19.960 --> 02:20:21.841]  They put up barbed wire to keep him from getting through.
[02:20:22.321 --> 02:20:24.542]  But when they're crawling over the barbed wire, what are you supposed to do?
[02:20:24.562 --> 02:20:25.422]  You're not in that position.
[02:20:26.142 --> 02:20:28.423]  And look, I'm not here to defend Governor Abbott.
[02:20:28.463 --> 02:20:29.424]  That's not my job.
[02:20:30.004 --> 02:20:48.131]  But I'm also the type of guy that when all hell's breaking loose all around us and things are so crazy and 15 states have lined up behind Texas and are sending troops and Biden says he's going to federalize the National Guard to stop this, optically this is a big deal, a big wake-up call, a big constitutional crisis.
[02:20:48.971 --> 02:20:54.296]  And so however Abbott got pushed into finally doing the right thing, it is a good thing overall.
[02:20:54.696 --> 02:20:56.678]  I get the other talk show hosts.
[02:20:56.878 --> 02:21:01.503]  They spend all their time about who's the most perfect and who you can totally trust and all this stuff.
[02:21:02.571 --> 02:21:03.872]  And that's fine and dandy.
[02:21:03.952 --> 02:21:05.052]  And I'm not even getting into Michael Young.
[02:21:05.072 --> 02:21:05.773]  I respect him a lot.
[02:21:06.493 --> 02:21:07.494]  I've been a big critic of Abbott.
[02:21:07.714 --> 02:21:12.157]  It's just the whole show is continually about is Abbott good or not?
[02:21:12.597 --> 02:21:14.018]  Or is Elon Musk good or not?
[02:21:14.158 --> 02:21:14.858]  Or is this or that?
[02:21:15.458 --> 02:21:16.959]  We are in a new world order.
[02:21:17.019 --> 02:21:17.960]  We're in a takeover.
[02:21:18.440 --> 02:21:19.881]  They're trying to start World War III.
[02:21:20.221 --> 02:21:23.023]  And I'm simply saying it's great to have all these states doing this.
[02:21:23.363 --> 02:21:24.904]  And it's great to see all this unfolding.
[02:21:25.124 --> 02:21:29.306]  But I can't answer your question about Greg Abbott and who he prays to at 2 a.m.
[02:21:29.326 --> 02:21:29.667]  in the morning.
[02:21:30.247 --> 02:21:30.967]  I mean, I can't do it.
[02:21:31.047 --> 02:21:31.468]  I don't know.
[02:21:32.324 --> 02:21:32.764]  I don't know.
[02:21:33.465 --> 02:21:34.505]  I've been to the border a bunch.
[02:21:34.565 --> 02:21:35.826]  I've shown the human trafficking.
[02:21:36.146 --> 02:21:36.966]  I've been to Congress.
[02:21:37.006 --> 02:21:37.687]  I've exposed it.
[02:21:37.707 --> 02:21:38.567]  I'm doing what I can do.
[02:21:39.568 --> 02:21:39.888]  All right.
[02:21:40.028 --> 02:21:40.888]  I appreciate your call.
[02:21:40.948 --> 02:21:41.809]  Billy in Oklahoma.
[02:21:41.829 --> 02:21:42.229]  Go ahead.
[02:21:47.131 --> 02:21:47.611]  Can you hear me?
[02:21:47.872 --> 02:21:48.472]  I sure can.
[02:21:48.492 --> 02:21:52.594]  Hey, I just called to put a smile on your face and everybody else's.
[02:21:52.634 --> 02:21:53.414]  You ready?
[02:21:53.935 --> 02:21:54.735]  Go ahead.
[02:21:58.439 --> 02:21:59.199]  Can you hear that?
[02:21:59.339 --> 02:22:00.199]  That's a little baby.
[02:22:00.239 --> 02:22:00.800]  That's beautiful.
[02:22:01.500 --> 02:22:02.540]  Yes, sir.
[02:22:02.700 --> 02:22:06.281]  I'm not going to take up any more of your time, but I figured everybody could use a smile.
[02:22:07.022 --> 02:22:07.622]  And here you go.
[02:22:12.723 --> 02:22:13.384]  Thank you, God.
[02:22:13.504 --> 02:22:14.564]  And take that, Bill Gates.
[02:22:15.680 --> 02:22:16.220]  Absolutely.
[02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:17.821]  You're not depopulating that family.
[02:22:17.861 --> 02:22:18.441]  Thank you, Billy.
[02:22:19.081 --> 02:22:21.342]  Robinson in Chile, calling from another country.
[02:22:21.782 --> 02:22:22.522]  I'd have gone to you earlier.
[02:22:22.582 --> 02:22:23.122]  I'd have seen that.
[02:22:23.162 --> 02:22:24.023]  I wasn't paying attention.
[02:22:24.523 --> 02:22:25.263]  Go ahead, Robinson.
[02:22:26.644 --> 02:22:27.084]  Hey, Alex.
[02:22:28.084 --> 02:22:35.847]  One thing I'd like to share with you about the border invasion is how people who are waking up, they can see how this is a total global thing.
[02:22:36.107 --> 02:22:40.708]  Because here in Chile, we have the exact same invasion you guys are experiencing on the border.
[02:22:41.148 --> 02:22:42.149]  It's the same thing.
[02:22:42.229 --> 02:22:42.469]  People...
[02:22:43.911 --> 02:22:47.312]  Crawling in from the border, aided by the U.N., the government.
[02:22:47.712 --> 02:22:49.393]  They're being bussed around the country.
[02:22:49.733 --> 02:22:51.554]  It's the exact same thing.
[02:22:51.594 --> 02:22:54.715]  So people can see how these things happen over in different countries.
[02:22:54.735 --> 02:22:55.956]  Oh, it's all run by the U.N.
[02:22:56.036 --> 02:22:56.636]  NGOs.
[02:22:57.376 --> 02:23:02.838]  So whether it's Chile or whether it's the U.S., cut the funding to the NGOs.
[02:23:04.499 --> 02:23:04.999]  Exactly.
[02:23:05.099 --> 02:23:10.501]  And, for example, over here, Venezuela was intentionally destroyed, one of the richest countries at the time.
[02:23:11.041 --> 02:23:12.162]  And now they have 95% poverty.
[02:23:13.969 --> 02:23:21.813]  People living under poverty and running through the desert and the mountains to get over here, and they're aided by the UN and so on, so it's the same thing.
[02:23:22.173 --> 02:23:33.319]  But one important thing to look for is that this happened, this started to happen here around 10 years ago under Bachelet, President Bachelet, who is now one of the heads of the UN.
[02:23:34.420 --> 02:23:38.822]  So you can see how things happened 10 years before here, and then it's happening later.
[02:23:39.364 --> 02:23:39.784]  Absolutely.
[02:23:39.884 --> 02:23:42.787]  What do you think of 15 states now joining with Texas?
[02:23:42.807 --> 02:23:46.089]  I hope it doesn't go kinetic, let's say, but
[02:24:10.426 --> 02:24:14.388]  It's basic to defend the Constitution and the country.
[02:24:14.769 --> 02:24:15.589]  And that's the only way.
[02:24:17.291 --> 02:24:31.041]  Absolutely, because again, the UN has internal groups in each country with government funding that put the illegal aliens on welfare so it's a group they control and a group they can siphon money off of.
[02:24:31.481 --> 02:24:33.482]  That's just one level of their political control.
[02:24:33.883 --> 02:24:35.304]  Thank you, sir, from Chile.
[02:24:36.084 --> 02:24:37.465]  Let's go to Val in Colorado.
[02:24:37.505 --> 02:24:38.406]  Val, thanks for calling.
[02:24:39.588 --> 02:24:40.248]  Good day, Alex.
[02:24:40.388 --> 02:24:41.829]  Thank you for your love of truth.
[02:24:41.869 --> 02:24:43.550]  Thank you for always reaching out.
[02:24:44.010 --> 02:24:49.172]  And thank you for the listeners, for their love of truth, your staff, for not succumbing to the spirit of fear.
[02:24:49.752 --> 02:24:54.514]  You guys are a lightning rod and a source of strength to all of us.
[02:24:55.414 --> 02:25:04.318]  So yesterday, Viva Frey made a point that it was pretty impactful because I felt like this has been coming for a while.
[02:25:05.238 --> 02:25:07.539]  And the point was an insurmountable
[02:25:08.146 --> 02:25:11.247]  Change in momentum in the public psyche.
[02:25:11.407 --> 02:25:13.247]  Yeah, what was the term he used?
[02:25:13.327 --> 02:25:14.448]  It was a momentum term.
[02:25:15.448 --> 02:25:19.609]  Insurmountable change of momentum or something very close to that.
[02:25:19.629 --> 02:25:20.249]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:25:20.269 --> 02:25:21.410]  There's been a change of momentum.
[02:25:21.830 --> 02:25:22.650]  Nothing's perfect.
[02:25:22.670 --> 02:25:24.130]  We're not offering a utopia.
[02:25:24.451 --> 02:25:27.571]  We don't say it's all fixed, but you can feel the momentum is shifting.
[02:25:28.652 --> 02:25:33.153]  Absolutely, and I think that we've gone over a ridge in this respect.
[02:25:33.893 --> 02:25:36.654]  And with that, we've got to
[02:25:37.168 --> 02:25:38.589]  There's a lot coming at us, Alex.
[02:25:39.309 --> 02:25:41.650]  There's a lot coming at us, and with that is responsibility.
[02:25:42.350 --> 02:25:49.414]  We've got to really start considering, since we're now rising, the responsibility that's going to come with that.
[02:25:49.614 --> 02:26:04.661]  As we overwhelm the spirit of hatred and the spirit of fear that is our enemy, we've got to figure out a way not to become that same spirit, because it's what happens time and time over in history.
[02:26:05.646 --> 02:26:09.608]  We've got to figure out how to stay on the side of love and fearlessness.
[02:26:10.268 --> 02:26:11.228]  No, I totally agree.
[02:26:11.308 --> 02:26:13.909]  While opposing this monster, we can't become the monster.
[02:26:14.789 --> 02:26:15.230]  Yes, sir.
[02:26:15.470 --> 02:26:15.890]  Yes, sir.
[02:26:16.170 --> 02:26:21.252]  While slaying monsters, I forget who said it, while slaying monsters, be careful you don't become the monsters.
[02:26:22.212 --> 02:26:23.573]  Yep, absolutely.
[02:26:24.213 --> 02:26:25.053]  That's it, man.
[02:26:25.073 --> 02:26:26.794]  I appreciate the time, Alex.
[02:26:27.574 --> 02:26:31.816]  I wish blessings for you and for your family and everybody that's tuned in.
[02:26:32.906 --> 02:26:34.509]  God bless you all, brothers and sisters.
[02:26:35.350 --> 02:26:36.292]  God bless you, Val.
[02:26:36.312 --> 02:26:36.833]  Thank you.
[02:26:36.954 --> 02:26:37.374]  Thank you.
[02:26:37.395 --> 02:26:39.238]  We're going to go to break in about a minute and a half.
[02:26:39.258 --> 02:26:42.264]  We're going to come back and go to Greg and Brian and man.
[02:26:43.786 --> 02:26:44.507]  We're good to go.
[02:26:44.567 --> 02:26:45.467]  We're good to go.
[02:27:14.146 --> 02:27:15.407]  It's got the nuclear family on it.
[02:27:15.427 --> 02:27:17.087]  It says Team Humanity above it.
[02:27:18.208 --> 02:27:19.708]  1776, Infowars.com.
[02:27:19.768 --> 02:27:22.429]  We'll show you an image there at Infowars.com.
[02:27:22.809 --> 02:27:24.310]  Please get the shirt.
[02:27:25.070 --> 02:27:26.371]  There's two different designs.
[02:27:26.991 --> 02:27:32.813]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:27:32.953 --> 02:27:34.574]  Please get the shirt.
[02:27:35.314 --> 02:27:36.234]  And yeah, we could sell them.
[02:27:36.294 --> 02:27:38.175]  The shirt costs like $10, $12 a print.
[02:27:38.515 --> 02:27:41.296]  We could sell it for that, but it wouldn't give us funds to operate.
[02:27:41.616 --> 02:27:42.617]  So you get the shirt.
[02:27:43.422 --> 02:27:47.710]  It's high quality, it's a piece of history, and it funds the operation.
[02:27:47.770 --> 02:27:48.391]  It's incredible.
[02:27:49.980 --> 02:27:50.320]  Peace.
[02:27:51.621 --> 02:27:53.322]  An amazing conversational starter.
[02:27:54.142 --> 02:27:55.643]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:27:55.743 --> 02:27:57.164]  Team Humanity t-shirt.
[02:27:57.184 --> 02:27:58.785]  And it's not pre-sale anymore.
[02:27:59.525 --> 02:28:00.846]  So let's get that changed.
[02:28:00.906 --> 02:28:01.986]  It's been in stock for a week.
[02:28:02.586 --> 02:28:03.747]  It's no longer pre-sale.
[02:28:04.127 --> 02:28:05.528]  I told people a month ago it was pre-sale.
[02:28:05.568 --> 02:28:07.349]  It takes two weeks to get a shirt printed.
[02:28:07.789 --> 02:28:09.030]  But these are extra high quality.
[02:28:09.110 --> 02:28:10.911]  It's been in for six, seven days.
[02:28:11.511 --> 02:28:12.411]  No more pre-sale.
[02:28:12.812 --> 02:28:16.834]  The shirt is now available in two different designs.
[02:28:16.934 --> 02:28:17.654]  Team Humanity.
[02:28:17.694 --> 02:28:18.575]  And I'm asking you...
[02:28:19.451 --> 02:28:19.951]  No, no, no.
[02:28:42.592 --> 02:28:45.013]  Or the rainbow pedophile flag.
[02:28:45.073 --> 02:28:45.253]  No.
[02:28:45.653 --> 02:28:48.114]  This is Team Humanity, the nuclear family.
[02:28:48.134 --> 02:28:49.515]  Let's celebrate it now.
[02:28:49.895 --> 02:28:50.615]  Get the shirt.
[02:28:50.735 --> 02:28:51.576]  Make the decision.
[02:28:51.636 --> 02:28:52.576]  Defeat the globalists.
[02:28:58.321 --> 02:29:02.626]  99 years on air, all I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalists.
[02:29:03.326 --> 02:29:08.651]  And I've done the best job I can to tell the truth and be accurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[02:29:09.032 --> 02:29:11.594]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves.
[02:29:12.014 --> 02:29:16.398]  Unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people, we don't do that.
[02:29:16.859 --> 02:29:18.761]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[02:29:19.141 --> 02:29:21.163]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product.
[02:29:21.203 --> 02:29:21.784]  It's so powerful.
[02:29:22.684 --> 02:29:32.752]  This is the breakdown product after your cells process it of folic acid, methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[02:29:33.212 --> 02:29:34.433]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[02:29:34.473 --> 02:29:35.674]  It's not a stimulant.
[02:29:35.794 --> 02:29:37.396]  It energizes your cells.
[02:29:37.976 --> 02:29:40.498]  And then everything else you take just supercharges it.
[02:29:40.518 --> 02:29:41.339]  It's so insane.
[02:29:41.699 --> 02:29:43.200]  It's foundational energy.
[02:29:43.661 --> 02:29:47.804]  The strongest formula out there at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:29:48.204 --> 02:29:51.046]  It doesn't just energize this operation against the tyrants.
[02:29:51.147 --> 02:29:52.247]  It energizes you.
[02:29:52.528 --> 02:29:53.929]  Get foundational energy now.
[02:29:58.425 --> 02:30:03.887]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[02:30:04.627 --> 02:30:08.908]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[02:30:09.308 --> 02:30:13.690]  We finally have a limited run back in supply at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:30:15.130 --> 02:30:17.872]  So many people have serious issues.
[02:30:18.172 --> 02:30:19.292]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[02:30:19.732 --> 02:30:25.155]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[02:30:25.695 --> 02:30:31.098]  Most of their iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[02:30:31.718 --> 02:30:34.620]  But this is pure atomic certified iodine.
[02:30:36.394 --> 02:30:36.694]  Iodine.
[02:30:37.295 --> 02:30:40.376]  X2 is now back in stock, discounted.
[02:30:40.717 --> 02:30:43.899]  So I'm giving Thanksgiving right now for this product being here.
[02:30:44.239 --> 02:30:49.342]  It funds the InfoWar, but I guarantee you, you take this for a few weeks, you will feel the difference.
[02:30:49.502 --> 02:30:50.302]  It is amazing.
[02:30:50.623 --> 02:30:56.626]  It's the missing link, X2, back in stock at the end of 2023 at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:30:57.047 --> 02:30:57.447]  X2.
[02:30:58.207 --> 02:31:00.369]  Media Matters, the Democratic Party.
[02:31:01.309 --> 02:31:02.350]  I just want to say this.
[02:31:02.370 --> 02:31:02.751]  Go f*** yourselves.
[02:31:14.003 --> 02:31:20.310]  Alex Jones New World Order Wars has been number one on Steam thanks to the viewers and listeners of this broadcast.
[02:31:20.651 --> 02:31:33.866]  And I want to invite everyone, before they are successful at banning, which I hope they aren't, to go to alexjonesgame.com and follow the link to Steam and download this game for $17.76 as a message to the New World Order.
[02:31:34.286 --> 02:31:35.027]  F*** you.
[02:31:35.607 --> 02:31:43.596]  You want to try to ban this game just like you want to steal elections and force injections on us and open up our borders and rape us.
[02:31:43.996 --> 02:31:47.980]  This is a culture war and they're scared of this game.
[02:31:48.420 --> 02:31:57.149]  Get Alex Jones New World Order Wars right now at AlexJonesGame.com because anything badass gets censored!
[02:31:58.070 --> 02:32:01.753]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[02:32:02.494 --> 02:32:07.178]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:32:07.739 --> 02:32:19.629]  They are both clones of national best-selling products from a major pharmaceutical-slash-supplement maker that are listeners and patriots that are allowing us to private label it at a lower price than you'll find in stores.
[02:32:20.090 --> 02:32:23.252]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[02:32:23.933 --> 02:32:24.413]  We're good to go.
[02:32:43.949 --> 02:32:49.233]  Renew from InfoWarsMD, exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[02:32:49.654 --> 02:32:51.175]  Introducing them both, 25% off.
[02:32:51.295 --> 02:32:55.818]  You'll find them exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com, and they fund their operation.
[02:32:59.201 --> 02:33:05.106]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:17.486 --> 02:33:18.446]  You want answers?
[02:33:19.046 --> 02:33:19.987]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:20.087 --> 02:33:21.567]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:21.787 --> 02:33:32.809]  We're getting a lot of calls on air and a lot of calls off air saying, hey, Greg Abbott went along with the lockdowns partially and he's done a lot of other wimpy stuff.
[02:33:32.849 --> 02:33:33.669]  We don't like him.
[02:33:34.489 --> 02:33:36.630]  So what are you doing saying this is a good thing?
[02:33:37.690 --> 02:33:40.791]  Well, these are politicians, so they blow which way the wind blows.
[02:33:41.991 --> 02:33:42.651]  Like a weather vane.
[02:33:43.815 --> 02:33:46.438]  So, there's massive pressure against the open border.
[02:33:46.478 --> 02:33:47.478]  It's the number one issue.
[02:33:47.498 --> 02:33:49.000]  People see the invasion happening.
[02:33:49.721 --> 02:33:52.843]  And he's down there defying the feds and has gotten 15 states to back him.
[02:33:53.124 --> 02:33:54.445]  And they're sending troops down here.
[02:33:54.785 --> 02:33:59.530]  That creates a giant political crisis and points out that Biden's a total traitor.
[02:33:59.830 --> 02:34:01.431]  That is only positive.
[02:34:03.453 --> 02:34:06.296]  You know, when Christ was crucified, and the whole Bible's a lesson.
[02:34:07.429 --> 02:34:07.830]  We're good to go.
[02:34:25.373 --> 02:34:26.173]  It doesn't matter.
[02:34:26.193 --> 02:34:27.873]  He has got the guard down there.
[02:34:28.114 --> 02:34:29.214]  He started at one spot.
[02:34:29.454 --> 02:34:30.734]  The feds are threatening to throw him out.
[02:34:31.074 --> 02:34:33.454]  Now the Border Patrol refuses to follow Biden's orders.
[02:34:33.715 --> 02:34:39.856]  Biden's about to probably federalize the state guards of the country, which is going to push this absolutely in front of the Supreme Court.
[02:34:40.336 --> 02:34:41.196]  Accelerate it.
[02:34:42.536 --> 02:34:43.696]  And what's going on is illegal.
[02:34:43.736 --> 02:34:48.477]  If the Supreme Court rules in favor of Biden, we know they're compromised and they're going to rule against Trump.
[02:34:48.717 --> 02:34:52.598]  But we're not sitting here on the defense taking it anymore.
[02:34:53.868 --> 02:34:55.529]  We're demanding action.
[02:34:56.530 --> 02:34:58.451]  And are all these other governors bad?
[02:34:58.932 --> 02:34:59.472]  I don't know.
[02:34:59.612 --> 02:35:01.594]  Most of them are probably good that have joined us.
[02:35:02.154 --> 02:35:03.075]  Alabama just joined.
[02:35:05.857 --> 02:35:06.657]  They're sending troops.
[02:35:07.538 --> 02:35:08.238]  This is big.
[02:35:08.518 --> 02:35:09.839]  We'll be at the border covering.
[02:35:10.820 --> 02:35:12.021]  Drew Hernandez is hosting today.
[02:35:12.041 --> 02:35:13.122]  He's about to go down there this weekend.
[02:35:14.823 --> 02:35:17.345]  So all this is unfolding.
[02:35:19.160 --> 02:35:23.582]  And so I can't sit here and wave a magic wand and say, I know who's perfect and I know who isn't.
[02:35:23.882 --> 02:35:24.722]  I know I love God.
[02:35:25.182 --> 02:35:26.143]  I know I want justice.
[02:35:26.543 --> 02:35:27.523]  I know I'm not for sale.
[02:35:28.444 --> 02:35:35.026]  But I'm not going to sit there when we see all this in motion and then say, well, you know, I don't know about that guy.
[02:35:36.747 --> 02:35:39.968]  Because it's exposing the open border.
[02:35:40.288 --> 02:35:41.529]  It's drawing attention to it.
[02:35:42.009 --> 02:35:43.609]  Oh, Biden doesn't like that.
[02:35:44.270 --> 02:35:47.271]  This is a positive thing overall that's happening.
[02:35:49.059 --> 02:35:53.241]  And I use the cheesy analogy of, you know, Star Wars or Return of the Jedi.
[02:35:54.622 --> 02:35:58.764]  It's episode six, where Darth Vader's watching Palpatine kill his own son.
[02:36:00.510 --> 02:36:01.691]  We're good to go.
[02:36:22.549 --> 02:36:24.010]  I mean, we're in the right, folks.
[02:36:24.390 --> 02:36:25.830]  This human smuggling is illegal.
[02:36:26.070 --> 02:36:27.351]  These open borders are sick.
[02:36:27.671 --> 02:36:33.633]  It's all Congress sits there on their hands like they don't know what's going on when they fund the State Department funding 80% of this.
[02:36:34.353 --> 02:36:35.974]  Roll the clip from Return of the Jedi.
[02:37:00.066 --> 02:37:17.836]  No!
[02:37:20.578 --> 02:37:27.923]  But regardless, ladies and gentlemen, the New World Order is destroying our country right in front of us.
[02:37:29.068 --> 02:37:32.131]  And these 15 states and what's happening is exactly what they fear.
[02:37:34.353 --> 02:37:36.335]  The globalists are not all powerful.
[02:37:36.355 --> 02:37:38.978]  And we have to stop acting like they are.
[02:37:39.018 --> 02:37:39.418]  They're not.
[02:37:39.498 --> 02:37:40.699]  I've been doing this 30 years.
[02:37:41.200 --> 02:37:42.461]  And I'm telling you, they're pathetic.
[02:37:42.861 --> 02:37:45.784]  What they count on is you not being awake and you not being engaged.
[02:37:46.265 --> 02:37:53.372]  A woman famously in a newspaper article, I forget where, but you can look it up, asked Thomas Jefferson, she said, what is the level of tyranny...
[02:37:55.017 --> 02:37:58.260]  And this is a process, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:38:21.459 --> 02:38:21.979]  We're good to go.
[02:38:21.999 --> 02:38:22.700]  We're good to go.
[02:38:49.582 --> 02:38:51.163]  You think our Revolutionary War was perfect?
[02:38:51.183 --> 02:38:53.184]  You don't think it was full of traitors?
[02:38:53.224 --> 02:38:53.544]  It was.
[02:38:53.564 --> 02:38:54.905]  Benedict Arnold, we found out who he was.
[02:38:55.185 --> 02:38:57.046]  We'll find out who the traitors are, don't you worry.
[02:38:57.066 --> 02:38:58.386]  And they'll be held accountable.
[02:38:59.987 --> 02:39:04.829]  But we have the initiative, just like Viva Fry said, and I forget the term the caller reminded me.
[02:39:04.889 --> 02:39:07.551]  It was unstoppable momentum?
[02:39:07.571 --> 02:39:08.391]  No, that was not what he said.
[02:39:08.431 --> 02:39:08.811]  What was it?
[02:39:13.173 --> 02:39:14.234]  You can see it, folks.
[02:39:15.595 --> 02:39:19.898]  Tucker Carlson goes to Canada day one and 30-something thousand people pack an arena.
[02:39:20.618 --> 02:39:20.898]  Probably 50,000.
[02:39:21.458 --> 02:39:24.480]  No one can find the number.
[02:39:25.081 --> 02:39:26.662]  What's the capacity of that thing in Calgary?
[02:39:27.262 --> 02:39:28.182]  The thing's at capacity.
[02:39:29.944 --> 02:39:33.586]  Everywhere Trump goes, I don't say this to act like, oh, I'm so popular.
[02:39:34.446 --> 02:39:36.227]  I go out in public all I get is love.
[02:39:36.287 --> 02:39:36.908]  So does Trump.
[02:39:37.588 --> 02:39:40.630]  Biden gets nothing but hatred because they're not popular people.
[02:39:42.449 --> 02:39:43.770]  Freedom is popular.
[02:39:43.870 --> 02:39:45.591]  We can do this together.
[02:39:46.532 --> 02:39:49.074]  But we've got to stop acting like we're the losers.
[02:39:49.154 --> 02:39:50.115]  We're the winners.
[02:39:53.217 --> 02:39:54.038]  Let's get the network break.
[02:39:54.618 --> 02:39:55.479]  Craig in Florida.
[02:39:55.499 --> 02:39:55.999]  You're on the air.
[02:39:56.039 --> 02:39:56.299]  Go ahead.
[02:39:56.319 --> 02:39:56.780]  Thanks for calling.
[02:39:58.101 --> 02:40:02.424]  Well, let's not let it be death of a salesman, Alex, because you are the consummate salesman.
[02:40:04.606 --> 02:40:07.168]  And your fire is what we all love, man.
[02:40:07.208 --> 02:40:08.108]  We're addicted to it.
[02:40:08.128 --> 02:40:09.069]  I know you're a humble guy.
[02:40:09.089 --> 02:40:10.130]  You don't like to hear it, but...
[02:40:10.879 --> 02:40:11.620]  You're a patriot.
[02:40:11.780 --> 02:40:13.703]  You are the number one patriot on the front line.
[02:40:13.983 --> 02:40:19.310]  My question about this whole thing is, what happens if this brews up to a separation of states here?
[02:40:19.350 --> 02:40:23.235]  Because we got Amy Comey Barrett that just let us down in the Supreme Court.
[02:40:24.494 --> 02:40:25.615]  Crazy, right?
[02:40:26.896 --> 02:40:28.658]  What's your take on where we go from there?
[02:40:28.698 --> 02:40:30.719]  We got Johnson, who's doing nothing.
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.021]  No tapes released from J6, nothing.
[02:40:33.041 --> 02:40:34.823]  He's another... No, look, look, look.
[02:40:35.383 --> 02:40:39.587]  We got this head of the RNC in Arizona caught trying to bribe people and threaten them.
[02:40:39.787 --> 02:40:40.708]  Look, and he just went down.
[02:40:40.728 --> 02:40:41.208]  Yeah, I heard it.
[02:40:42.049 --> 02:40:43.050]  So, I mean, here's the deal.
[02:40:45.511 --> 02:40:53.841]  Look, we didn't look for a fight, but if you're walking on a parking lot at night and some dude knocks you upside the head for no reason, you don't know if you're going to win, but you're going to go ahead and beat the hell out of him, right?
[02:40:54.542 --> 02:40:56.584]  So I say that politically.
[02:40:56.685 --> 02:40:57.746]  I don't know how all this is going to end.
[02:40:57.766 --> 02:40:58.907]  I've said this a thousand times.
[02:40:59.868 --> 02:41:05.215]  I don't know how it's all going to end, but we're already in the fight, brother, and so that's all I know.
[02:41:06.896 --> 02:41:09.637]  Our leverage is that we separate.
[02:41:09.737 --> 02:41:12.358]  Texas already had a model for separating.
[02:41:12.379 --> 02:41:13.019]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:41:13.159 --> 02:41:16.920]  I don't like the breakup of the country, but it's already gone.
[02:41:16.940 --> 02:41:17.601]  We're already under U.N.
[02:41:17.641 --> 02:41:17.941]  control.
[02:41:17.981 --> 02:41:19.622]  So, yes, I have said this for decades.
[02:41:20.242 --> 02:41:26.725]  I would be for the states pulling out of the compact to reestablish the republic under the original Bill of Rights Declaration of Independence Constitution.
[02:41:26.765 --> 02:41:27.245]  I mean, I agree.
[02:41:28.291 --> 02:41:31.493]  I mean, I would actually support, right now we've got 15 states.
[02:41:31.933 --> 02:41:33.634]  They could just say, we no longer represent the feds.
[02:41:33.654 --> 02:41:37.616]  We're not going to shoot you, we're not going to kill you, we're not going to have a civil war like the liberal media says.
[02:41:38.036 --> 02:41:49.802]  We're going to politically say, we no longer are under your control, and then we can have our own constitutional convention, and another 10 states will join us, and we'll just frog march those people out there, and have a new election, and it's game over.
[02:41:49.822 --> 02:41:50.763]  It's got to happen.
[02:41:51.283 --> 02:41:53.124]  That's a peaceful coup, by the way.
[02:41:54.084 --> 02:41:54.945]  A peaceful counter-coup.
[02:41:56.494 --> 02:41:59.898]  ...together, threaten federal taxes, hold back federal taxes.
[02:42:00.899 --> 02:42:01.420]  Well, here's the thing.
[02:42:01.440 --> 02:42:02.621]  Everybody thinks they need federal taxes.
[02:42:02.641 --> 02:42:03.822]  They use that for political control.
[02:42:04.403 --> 02:42:05.945]  They print all the money they want, brother.
[02:42:05.965 --> 02:42:10.890]  And again, I don't want a secession.
[02:42:11.111 --> 02:42:12.312]  I don't want a civil war.
[02:42:12.512 --> 02:42:15.656]  I don't want... The federal government is captured.
[02:42:17.375 --> 02:42:22.858]  So whatever peaceful mechanism we've got, I don't even want to get rid of the agencies and stuff, most of them.
[02:42:23.178 --> 02:42:25.319]  They can be repurposed and retooled and repeopled.
[02:42:25.999 --> 02:42:27.220]  But they're hijacked now.
[02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:27.820]  Does that make sense?
[02:42:28.841 --> 02:42:29.161]  Yeah.
[02:42:29.721 --> 02:42:36.444]  And, you know, hopefully there's going to be more than 15 states here if we cause some ruckus and put pressure on everyone's states.
[02:42:36.785 --> 02:42:37.325]  No, I agree.
[02:42:37.365 --> 02:42:39.906]  And we don't realize how much power we've got.
[02:42:42.507 --> 02:42:43.568]  Yeah, they don't like phone calls.
[02:42:44.346 --> 02:42:44.986]  They don't like any of it.
[02:42:45.727 --> 02:42:48.888]  And they don't like the fact that Tucker Carlson has 50,000 people at his rally.
[02:42:50.089 --> 02:42:50.309]  Right.
[02:42:50.569 --> 02:42:57.993]  Well... I mean, Tucker calls the leader of Canada and says, I'm coming to free your country, and 50,000 people show up.
[02:42:58.013 --> 02:42:58.653]  You think they like that?
[02:43:00.729 --> 02:43:03.711]  Listen, all 15 of these states, you should contact them.
[02:43:03.771 --> 02:43:13.656]  You should try to rally in those 15 states to show how much support there is for what each one of those states is doing, and then ricochet it out to other states, put the pressure on them.
[02:43:13.696 --> 02:43:21.380]  Hey, all you do is send them a video of Tucker in Calgary and say, America wants this too, you dumbasses.
[02:43:22.529 --> 02:43:23.329]  And just stops.
[02:43:23.529 --> 02:43:28.931]  And then when the dumbasses get on board with us, we can't go, well, you used to not be perfect.
[02:43:29.471 --> 02:43:30.952]  We've got to invite them over.
[02:43:30.992 --> 02:43:31.392]  Let's go.
[02:43:31.452 --> 02:43:31.932]  Let's win.
[02:43:31.952 --> 02:43:32.913]  That's how you win a war.
[02:43:34.853 --> 02:43:36.714]  Listen, on another note, I'm a spark plug.
[02:43:36.754 --> 02:43:39.015]  I gave a couple of incredible money-making ideas.
[02:43:40.375 --> 02:43:41.596]  Oh, it was the cross-screener.
[02:43:41.616 --> 02:43:44.657]  I can't do that live here on air.
[02:43:44.677 --> 02:43:45.437]  Send me an email.
[02:43:45.477 --> 02:43:45.997]  I appreciate you.
[02:43:46.677 --> 02:43:48.338]  All right, let's go to Jeff in Alabama.
[02:43:48.358 --> 02:43:49.058]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[02:43:49.418 --> 02:43:50.979]  Glad to have Alabama join Texas.
[02:43:52.248 --> 02:43:54.390]  Yeah, I love Alabama joint texts.
[02:43:54.410 --> 02:44:17.070]  In fact, if you look back to the 60s, you could actually follow the same thing that Wallace did in some sort of standing just a few miles down the road at the University of Alabama, where the Alabama National Guard was actually called in under the president to activate, take charge away from Governor Wallace.
[02:44:17.645 --> 02:44:20.527]  So, what that did, of course, is shine a light.
[02:44:20.808 --> 02:44:22.649]  I love what Abbott's trying to do here.
[02:44:22.689 --> 02:44:26.773]  He's shining the light so that the whole nation can understand... I'm going to stop.
[02:44:26.833 --> 02:44:27.513]  I'm going to stop.
[02:44:27.633 --> 02:44:28.554]  I'm going to interrupt.
[02:44:28.594 --> 02:44:29.115]  You said it.
[02:44:29.775 --> 02:44:32.217]  This is only good what Abbott did, so let's not take it away.
[02:44:32.457 --> 02:44:38.362]  He's shining the light and pointing out the crisis that is there, and a bunch of people want to second-guess him, and I'm tired of it.
[02:44:39.483 --> 02:44:45.589]  Yeah, I am too, but he is doing exactly what he needs to do because he's forcing the hand of the U.S.
[02:44:45.629 --> 02:44:46.069]  government
[02:44:46.641 --> 02:44:55.147]  To come forward and say, okay, there is a problem, but we're going to activate your guard unit, your state guard, and try to take powers away from you.
[02:44:55.547 --> 02:44:58.990]  Hey, that's playing into the hands of the Texans.
[02:44:59.991 --> 02:45:00.651]  Explain that.
[02:45:00.731 --> 02:45:01.792]  Explain that, because you're dead on.
[02:45:02.693 --> 02:45:15.722]  Okay, I really believe that's showing the whole world that the government is inept on defending our national border down in Texas and, of course, all the way up through California.
[02:45:17.321 --> 02:45:22.883]  I spent 26 years in the military, still serving in a capacity right now.
[02:45:24.524 --> 02:45:33.708]  You know, served in Panama over 10 years of my career, so I eat the same dirt that Michael Young's eating down there right now, and probably Pete Chambers.
[02:45:35.309 --> 02:45:45.474]  But I see that America is waking up to the fact that if we don't stand up like Texas is doing right now,
[02:45:45.973 --> 02:45:49.154]  We're going to lose what little bit we've got left.
[02:45:52.235 --> 02:45:52.695]  Exactly.
[02:45:52.735 --> 02:45:54.095]  And I'm not going to second guess it.
[02:45:54.635 --> 02:45:57.556]  When it's got all these states behind it and it's constitutional, I'm going to see what happens.
[02:45:58.636 --> 02:45:59.057]  No doubt.
[02:45:59.177 --> 02:45:59.597]  No doubt.
[02:46:00.117 --> 02:46:01.617]  And it is constitutional.
[02:46:01.657 --> 02:46:04.518]  Number one job of the President of the United States is to protect the country.
[02:46:05.438 --> 02:46:07.079]  And he's completely inept on doing that.
[02:46:07.099 --> 02:46:09.479]  That's the first thing in the Constitution is to defend the border.
[02:46:10.360 --> 02:46:10.860]  Exactly.
[02:46:11.100 --> 02:46:11.460]  No doubt.
[02:46:12.301 --> 02:46:12.681]  No doubt.
[02:46:12.801 --> 02:46:14.182]  So what do you think is going to unfold?
[02:46:14.202 --> 02:46:17.485]  Because I'm seeing huge support being thrown behind Texas right now.
[02:46:17.505 --> 02:46:18.486]  I'm really proud of everybody.
[02:46:19.266 --> 02:46:19.847]  Yes.
[02:46:19.927 --> 02:46:25.431]  Just in the last few days, you had these states just coming forward and opening up.
[02:46:26.091 --> 02:46:27.632]  And I'm hoping to see more.
[02:46:28.093 --> 02:46:29.874]  I'm hoping it forces the hand of the U.S.
[02:46:29.894 --> 02:46:31.255]  government to act.
[02:46:31.875 --> 02:46:36.979]  I think we're just about too late as far as the 10 million that has already crossed the border.
[02:46:37.760 --> 02:46:39.581]  I don't know the answer yet.
[02:46:40.644 --> 02:46:44.568]  Well, nobody's going to complain about state taxes for deportation.
[02:46:44.588 --> 02:46:44.728]  Right.
[02:46:44.748 --> 02:46:50.793]  Who wouldn't pass a 5% extra tax for a year to deport every one of these people?
[02:47:05.311 --> 02:47:09.254]  I know, and our military hadn't made us gold in a couple of years now.
[02:47:09.274 --> 02:47:13.216]  I mean, we have the smallest military in 80 years right now, and it kills me.
[02:47:13.756 --> 02:47:22.362]  You know, I was enlisted for 14 years and then become an officer and retired officer, and it kills me to see this military like this.
[02:47:23.968 --> 02:47:24.248]  You're right.
[02:47:24.288 --> 02:47:25.509]  We don't even need more money to do this.
[02:47:25.569 --> 02:47:33.531]  I'm just saying nobody's going to stand in the way of state taxes, emergency taxes to create task force and kick these people out.
[02:47:33.771 --> 02:47:35.111]  And I'm sad with the people they brought here.
[02:47:35.312 --> 02:47:39.713]  Most of them aren't even bad, but they've been used as a weapon to take the country down.
[02:47:39.773 --> 02:47:40.353]  They've got to go.
[02:47:41.313 --> 02:47:41.773]  No doubt.
[02:47:41.853 --> 02:47:50.596]  And the thing about it is I think it may backfire on them because these people are coming across the majority of the families that actually come across
[02:47:51.624 --> 02:47:56.167]  I mean, they're God-fearing people for the most part.
[02:47:56.187 --> 02:48:01.451]  It's just the individuals, there's more and more people coming across the borders, and it's not family-oriented.
[02:48:01.471 --> 02:48:06.855]  Well, that's the issue, is they use these first groups to break our will, and then they bring in unlimited.
[02:48:06.895 --> 02:48:09.617]  That's why we've got to ship them back so that more don't come.
[02:48:09.657 --> 02:48:10.238]  It's got to be done.
[02:48:11.078 --> 02:48:12.519]  It's got to be done, no doubt.
[02:48:13.020 --> 02:48:13.380]  I agree.
[02:48:13.400 --> 02:48:14.321]  We've got big hearts.
[02:48:14.381 --> 02:48:15.201]  We love everybody.
[02:48:15.642 --> 02:48:18.684]  But, sorry, you came here illegally.
[02:48:18.724 --> 02:48:19.765]  Your ass is getting shipped back.
[02:48:20.751 --> 02:48:20.971]  Right.
[02:48:21.191 --> 02:48:21.592]  No doubt.
[02:48:22.192 --> 02:48:22.592]  No doubt.
[02:48:22.633 --> 02:48:23.433]  Great points, Jeff.
[02:48:23.453 --> 02:48:24.214]  Thank you so much.
[02:48:25.094 --> 02:48:29.698]  And look, folks, I'm not here in some Greg Abbott worship fest.
[02:48:30.118 --> 02:48:31.660]  We got 15 states behind us.
[02:48:32.100 --> 02:48:33.541]  I told you a week ago this was real.
[02:48:33.961 --> 02:48:36.023]  This is pissed off the out-of-control feds.
[02:48:36.283 --> 02:48:40.627]  This is getting the public's attention, and we are going to force the feds to overplay their hand.
[02:48:40.967 --> 02:48:46.151]  They're going to nationalize the state guard, and then it's off the races, okay?
[02:48:51.218 --> 02:48:52.099]  In Georgia, go ahead.
[02:48:53.179 --> 02:48:53.980]  Yes, sir.
[02:48:54.040 --> 02:48:56.421]  First thing I want to say, thank you for Prostagard.
[02:48:56.882 --> 02:48:57.722]  Love that product.
[02:48:57.802 --> 02:49:01.585]  I'm down to my last two bottles, so if you could get it back in stock.
[02:49:02.105 --> 02:49:06.548]  I know me, among a lot of other info warriors, would greatly appreciate that.
[02:49:06.648 --> 02:49:08.830]  We will.
[02:49:08.890 --> 02:49:15.314]  The thing I wanted to stress to everybody is that their ultimate goal here is depopulation.
[02:49:15.614 --> 02:49:19.817]  So what I'm afraid of is that the power goes out
[02:49:20.721 --> 02:49:23.564]  Oh, hell, they're having them join the military and the police.
[02:49:23.584 --> 02:49:26.266]  There's no question that's what's going on.
[02:49:34.451 --> 02:49:41.775]  Well, not even legitimately, but you have a major power outage event go on like they've been pre-programming.
[02:49:42.276 --> 02:49:50.821]  That's going to be the signal to all of these groups to loot, pillage, just go through city by city and depopulate.
[02:49:51.401 --> 02:49:54.783]  That's the ultimate goal here, everyone, is they want depopulation.
[02:49:55.583 --> 02:50:03.349]  And the report for 2025 that says that the United States will experience a severe reduction in population.
[02:50:03.369 --> 02:50:04.890]  You're talking about the Deagle report.
[02:50:04.930 --> 02:50:05.890]  People say, well, that's horrible.
[02:50:06.391 --> 02:50:07.892]  They want a post-industrial world.
[02:50:08.312 --> 02:50:09.573]  They can sabotage America.
[02:50:09.593 --> 02:50:10.874]  They can sabotage the whole world.
[02:50:11.214 --> 02:50:12.115]  You're dead on about that.
[02:50:13.413 --> 02:50:19.437]  That's my biggest fear, Mr. Jones, with all these people they're bringing in, is that it's a Trojan horse.
[02:50:20.258 --> 02:50:24.180]  They don't need to storm the beaches of the Carolinas or California.
[02:50:24.641 --> 02:50:28.083]  They already have their army inside of the country.
[02:50:28.663 --> 02:50:33.707]  And when the power goes out, that will be the ghost light for all of these groups.
[02:50:34.408 --> 02:50:42.801]  To go ahead and just, you know... Oh, anytime somebody tries to unelect a leftist in Europe, they have the Muslims burn down the cities.
[02:50:43.222 --> 02:50:45.285]  So yeah, you're not speculating.
[02:50:45.305 --> 02:50:45.866]  This has happened.
[02:50:46.227 --> 02:50:46.868]  I appreciate your call.
[02:50:48.148 --> 02:50:48.549]  We're good to go.
[02:50:48.569 --> 02:50:49.029]  We're good to go.
[02:51:05.912 --> 02:51:09.215]  Please get Winter Sun, the highest quality D3 that's so good for your immune system.
[02:51:09.495 --> 02:51:11.936]  Most viral spread and infection is caused by lack of D3.
[02:51:11.976 --> 02:51:14.078]  Especially during the winter months, you should be taking it.
[02:51:14.098 --> 02:51:16.219]  It's the highest quality and it supports the broadcast.
[02:51:16.460 --> 02:51:18.881]  Get Winter Sun at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:51:18.901 --> 02:51:21.803]  A lot of their big specials there as well.
[02:51:21.883 --> 02:51:26.567]  Ultimate Fish Oil, highest grade fish oil, so good for your heart, your cardiovascular, your brain.
[02:51:27.307 --> 02:51:29.829]  Cleans out your blood just like the Nitric Boost.
[02:51:30.369 --> 02:51:31.530]  It's available online.
[02:51:32.182 --> 02:51:38.086]  Back in stock, InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:51:38.786 --> 02:51:40.367]  All right, Randy in Colorado.
[02:51:40.427 --> 02:51:41.308]  Randy, you're on the air.
[02:51:41.348 --> 02:51:41.948]  Thanks for calling.
[02:51:42.889 --> 02:51:44.110]  Yeah, Alex, I love you, man.
[02:51:44.150 --> 02:51:45.991]  Thank you for the warning about the vaccine.
[02:51:46.011 --> 02:51:47.652]  You saved a lot of us there.
[02:51:48.853 --> 02:51:55.317]  I just wanted to say, you know, conspiracy theorists, conspiracy realists like yourself, we predicted the alien invasion, didn't we?
[02:51:55.717 --> 02:51:58.799]  But we didn't predict that it would be an illegal alien invasion.
[02:52:00.273 --> 02:52:07.913]  Well, we did... I mean, the whole UN plan is implode the third world with UN policies that they control and then flood us with these poor people.
[02:52:09.178 --> 02:52:09.598]  That's it.
[02:52:10.118 --> 02:52:10.578]  That's it.
[02:52:10.658 --> 02:52:15.399]  You know, I have a message for the satanic, globalist, pedophile, deep state.
[02:52:15.779 --> 02:52:16.479]  We see you.
[02:52:17.019 --> 02:52:17.600]  We see you.
[02:52:17.640 --> 02:52:18.620]  You've already lost.
[02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:20.280]  We have God on our side.
[02:52:20.580 --> 02:52:21.180]  We have Alex.
[02:52:21.240 --> 02:52:23.801]  We have so many people on our side.
[02:52:23.841 --> 02:52:24.421]  We have God.
[02:52:24.981 --> 02:52:25.421]  We won.
[02:52:25.441 --> 02:52:31.322]  They know that we won, and that's why they're importing our... They're hoping our replacements, right?
[02:52:31.482 --> 02:52:31.942]  2.0 Americans.
[02:52:32.202 --> 02:52:34.303]  They're going to try to do something crazy.
[02:52:34.363 --> 02:52:35.103]  We've got to be ready.
[02:52:35.703 --> 02:52:36.363]  We've got to be ready.
[02:52:36.523 --> 02:52:37.244]  Well, I think it's clear.
[02:52:37.264 --> 02:52:38.564]  They're going to false flag migrants.
[02:52:38.964 --> 02:52:41.825]  If I was them, and I wouldn't do this myself, I'm saying, I'd get in their brain.
[02:52:42.206 --> 02:52:48.148]  They're going to blow up or shoot a bunch of illegal aliens, and anybody that's for controlling the border is now a terrorist.
[02:52:48.528 --> 02:52:49.548]  I mean, you can see what's going on.
[02:52:51.269 --> 02:52:52.009]  Hold the line.
[02:52:52.410 --> 02:52:53.630]  Don't attack.
[02:52:54.170 --> 02:52:55.111]  Stay peaceful.
[02:52:55.511 --> 02:52:58.412]  Obviously, none of us are going to attack the Border Patrol, the illegal aliens.
[02:52:58.432 --> 02:52:59.192]  We feel sorry for them.
[02:52:59.532 --> 02:53:02.093]  But I'm saying the deep state is going to do that.
[02:53:02.714 --> 02:53:03.574]  People should be ready for that.
[02:53:04.727 --> 02:53:05.147]  That's right.
[02:53:05.307 --> 02:53:05.667]  That's right.
[02:53:05.687 --> 02:53:06.248]  You nailed it.
[02:53:06.348 --> 02:53:07.628]  I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[02:53:07.648 --> 02:53:10.029]  We've got to make it known that we are not violent.
[02:53:10.049 --> 02:53:10.770]  We are peaceful.
[02:53:11.150 --> 02:53:11.870]  We love God.
[02:53:12.030 --> 02:53:13.191]  We love the rule of law.
[02:53:14.011 --> 02:53:14.851]  We're patriots.
[02:53:15.091 --> 02:53:20.474]  And anyone who comes against us, you know, the satanic globalists, these people are sick.
[02:53:20.954 --> 02:53:21.794]  You know, they've got to go.
[02:53:21.854 --> 02:53:23.015]  They know their numbers.
[02:53:23.035 --> 02:53:23.675]  They are sick.
[02:53:23.695 --> 02:53:24.235]  Thank you, Randy.
[02:53:24.255 --> 02:53:25.336]  I'm going to move quickly, everybody.
[02:53:26.036 --> 02:53:28.357]  Let's go ahead and go to Steve and then Mankind.
[02:53:28.857 --> 02:53:30.398]  Steve in Oklahoma.
[02:53:30.418 --> 02:53:30.698]  Go ahead.
[02:53:32.250 --> 02:53:32.790]  Hey, Alex.
[02:53:33.251 --> 02:53:34.472]  Everybody get the products.
[02:53:34.512 --> 02:53:35.232]  They're amazing.
[02:53:35.252 --> 02:53:40.275]  I 100% support Texas and what Abbott's doing.
[02:53:40.295 --> 02:53:43.298]  And I think all 50 states should join in.
[02:53:44.578 --> 02:53:51.083]  And I really think with all the Boeing incidents going on, I think they're going to do something with Trump's plane, like you said before.
[02:53:52.124 --> 02:53:54.305]  And Biden, he's faking it.
[02:53:55.005 --> 02:53:56.166]  He said back in 2020 in December...
[02:53:57.535 --> 02:53:58.155]  I'm seeing it.
[02:53:58.195 --> 02:54:02.056]  He'll get a disease and then Kamala will become president.
[02:54:02.196 --> 02:54:06.957]  Yeah, remember he said, he goes, if the people in charge get tired of me, I'll just get a disease and retire.
[02:54:07.257 --> 02:54:09.538]  He did that right when he got elected, or stole the election.
[02:54:10.318 --> 02:54:11.538]  Yeah, yeah, it was in December 2020.
[02:54:11.878 --> 02:54:17.780]  Well, what do you make of all these states now that have lined up with Texas?
[02:54:19.272 --> 02:54:19.953]  It's awesome.
[02:54:20.614 --> 02:54:21.756]  All 50 need to join.
[02:54:21.836 --> 02:54:24.241]  I know it's not going to happen because there's a lot of blue states.
[02:54:24.661 --> 02:54:26.024]  By the way, it's now 17.
[02:54:26.064 --> 02:54:27.746]  I was saying 15 30 minutes ago.
[02:54:28.107 --> 02:54:29.610]  It's 17 states, brother.
[02:54:29.630 --> 02:54:33.336]  I think that's my wife.
[02:54:34.548 --> 02:54:35.749]  All 50 should join.
[02:54:35.829 --> 02:54:40.573]  No, it's not going to happen, but we always got to watch our six because who knows what they got up their sleeves.
[02:54:40.833 --> 02:54:43.415]  Well, I love how North Texas was the first place to join Texas.
[02:54:43.775 --> 02:54:44.896]  By the way, I love Oklahoma.
[02:54:45.417 --> 02:54:48.139]  It's a little bit of a rivalry, but everybody knows it's North Texas.
[02:54:48.579 --> 02:54:52.062]  Or you can say it's North Oklahoma.
[02:54:52.422 --> 02:54:54.404]  But, yeah, it's beautiful, brother.
[02:54:54.424 --> 02:54:55.124]  Thank you so much.
[02:54:56.025 --> 02:54:58.127]  Yeah, no, that's the first big movement we've seen.
[02:54:58.347 --> 02:55:01.610]  That scares the globalists down to their short hairs.
[02:55:03.271 --> 02:55:03.512]  19 now.
[02:55:03.972 --> 02:55:04.372]  Woo!
[02:55:04.953 --> 02:55:06.634]  Man, it is moving quick.
[02:55:07.115 --> 02:55:07.655]  Let's read them.
[02:55:08.135 --> 02:55:21.226]  Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia.
[02:55:21.246 --> 02:55:25.089]  Written sanctuary cities for America.
[02:55:26.290 --> 02:55:26.750]  Beautiful.
[02:55:26.830 --> 02:55:28.091]  Mankind and Arizona.
[02:55:28.111 --> 02:55:28.551]  You're on the air.
[02:55:28.611 --> 02:55:29.132]  Thanks for holding.
[02:55:40.343 --> 02:55:41.083]  Yes!
[02:55:41.103 --> 02:55:45.126]  Humanity is rising and is awake!
[02:55:45.707 --> 02:55:49.890]  Alex, no weapon formed against us shall prosper.
[02:55:50.150 --> 02:55:50.570]  Why?
[02:55:50.890 --> 02:55:54.433]  Because we pledge our lives... Oh, but Greg Abbott's not perfect.
[02:55:54.453 --> 02:55:55.494]  It has nothing to do with him.
[02:55:57.384 --> 02:55:57.704]  I know.
[02:55:58.024 --> 02:56:03.506]  I hear a lot of these guys trying to call in, but again, they're not using their heads first.
[02:56:03.886 --> 02:56:11.428]  They kind of want to just say something to be a part of the conversation, because obviously, you know, you judge a tree by its fruit.
[02:56:12.248 --> 02:56:17.509]  And when somebody's doing something good against this New World Order, that should be celebrated.
[02:56:18.109 --> 02:56:22.070]  And all I know is I've been real for 30 years, and these people always say I'm not real.
[02:56:22.370 --> 02:56:24.091]  I know for damn sure I'm real.
[02:56:25.163 --> 02:56:25.683]  Absolutely.
[02:56:26.163 --> 02:56:26.624]  Absolutely.
[02:56:26.764 --> 02:56:42.110]  And I've been listening to you for at least 25 years, and that's all I want to say is that everybody in this nation right now is pledging their lives, their fortunes, and our sacred honor to take this republic back because that's what's going to happen!
[02:56:42.450 --> 02:56:43.910]  I need to hear your war face!
[02:56:44.130 --> 02:56:44.911]  Your war face!
[02:56:49.879 --> 02:56:51.600]  Mankind is divine.
[02:56:51.920 --> 02:56:53.020]  We're going to get through this.
[02:56:53.060 --> 02:56:55.521]  We're already winning by being nonviolent.
[02:56:55.681 --> 02:56:57.221]  We just need to stay the course.
[02:56:57.782 --> 02:56:58.602]  No, but I'm worried.
[02:56:58.662 --> 02:56:59.542]  I'm worried, Mankind.
[02:56:59.562 --> 02:57:00.762]  You know they're going to blow some stuff up.
[02:57:02.143 --> 02:57:03.023]  I definitely do.
[02:57:03.043 --> 02:57:14.046]  That's actually one of the main things that I've been putting out on my media outlet as well is preparedness and not to fall for the false flag that we know are coming.
[02:57:14.602 --> 02:57:15.604]  What's your media outlet?
[02:57:15.624 --> 02:57:16.386]  I want to check it out.
[02:57:19.614 --> 02:57:21.215]  Oh, it's prophetic.net.
[02:57:21.295 --> 02:57:23.657]  That's P-R-O-P-H-E.
[02:57:23.797 --> 02:57:27.259]  T as in Tango, C as in Charlie.net.
[02:57:27.739 --> 02:57:29.100]  All right, don't hang up.
[02:57:29.140 --> 02:57:29.500]  Don't hang up.
[02:57:29.520 --> 02:57:37.966]  I'm going to give you a minute or two, and I'm going to go to George, Michael, and Carla, and then I'm going to hand the baton to the great Drew Hernandez, who's about to go to the border, and so are we.
[02:57:37.986 --> 02:57:38.826]  He's working with InfoWars.
[02:57:39.387 --> 02:57:43.629]  Hour number four straight ahead in the War Room with Owen Schroyer, 3 p.m.
[02:57:48.092 --> 02:57:52.314]  The Second American Revolution is happening now right in front of you.
[02:57:52.634 --> 02:57:56.996]  And you're tuned in to InfoWars because you're either looking for the truth or you're already a patriot.
[02:57:57.476 --> 02:58:05.319]  I'm asking you now to realize we are at the fulcrum, the crossroads in the fight for human destiny and human future.
[02:58:06.059 --> 02:58:06.659]  We're good.
[02:58:24.767 --> 02:58:25.848]  Infowars is the tip of the spear.
[02:58:25.868 --> 02:58:28.891]  If you want to support the tip of the spear, that decision is up to you.
[02:58:28.911 --> 02:58:30.172]  Please support us now at Infowars.com.

[02:58:55.276 --> 02:58:56.736]  Winter is coming.
[02:58:57.096 --> 02:58:58.477]  Winter isn't coming.
[02:58:59.077 --> 02:59:00.357]  Winter is here.

[03:00:02.541 --> 03:00:04.362]  But that was the old war.
[03:00:05.082 --> 03:00:09.124]  We've been losing for a long time, but now we're going to start winning.
[03:00:29.867 --> 03:00:31.848]  Hernandez coming up, and I'll finish with these four calls.
[03:00:32.268 --> 03:00:33.549]  Mankind, you're making some great points.
[03:00:33.569 --> 03:00:34.229]  Finish your points.
[03:00:35.630 --> 03:00:36.771]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:00:37.171 --> 03:00:52.479]  Again, just want everybody to continue to stay vigilant and stay peaceful, because as you see, by our nonviolent following in the ways of Martin Luther King or Gandhi and, of course, Jesus, these are the results that you get.
[03:00:52.959 --> 03:00:54.880]  That's how you change mankind.
[03:00:54.981 --> 03:00:57.562]  That's how you change the culture.
[03:00:58.058 --> 03:00:59.279]  Thank you for the call.
[03:00:59.339 --> 03:01:00.559]  Let's go to Carla in Virginia.
[03:01:00.579 --> 03:01:02.680]  Carla, thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:01:02.700 --> 03:01:02.940]  Hey Alex.
[03:01:02.960 --> 03:01:03.620]  Welcome.
[03:01:25.863 --> 03:01:26.944]  I'll make this real quick.
[03:01:27.024 --> 03:01:29.405]  There's one other issue we need to focus on.
[03:01:29.965 --> 03:01:36.828]  I think this border thing is horrendous and it's just terrible.
[03:01:37.549 --> 03:01:42.231]  But this WHO thing coming up in May, we need to start pounding that again.
[03:01:43.771 --> 03:01:47.873]  Because if those amendments go through, we're done.
[03:01:51.175 --> 03:01:51.915]  It won't matter.
[03:01:52.577 --> 03:01:57.721]  Well, for those that don't know, they've got the UN Pandemic Treaty to take over our nation, our health care, our bodies.
[03:01:58.281 --> 03:02:01.884]  And I would say, done on paper, but we're not going to follow their orders.
[03:02:01.924 --> 03:02:04.185]  But, yeah, I mean, I totally agree.
[03:02:04.205 --> 03:02:05.326]  It's all a UN.
[03:02:06.107 --> 03:02:07.187]  People say the UN's not powerful.
[03:02:07.227 --> 03:02:07.568]  No, it is.
[03:02:07.608 --> 03:02:08.628]  The globalists set it up.
[03:02:08.708 --> 03:02:09.549]  Our country set it up.
[03:02:09.929 --> 03:02:12.491]  Our traders set it up to transfer power to it.
[03:02:12.971 --> 03:02:15.333]  So, absolutely, we've got to stop the pandemic treaty.
[03:02:16.834 --> 03:02:18.075]  It's got to be hit.
[03:02:18.415 --> 03:02:22.258]  This issue has to be hit just as hard as the border because it's in tandem.
[03:02:23.436 --> 03:02:24.456]  I totally agree.
[03:02:25.217 --> 03:02:29.599]  These people coming across the border are going to be used against us if that treaty goes through.
[03:02:32.160 --> 03:02:33.420]  Well, we're fighting it, and I hear you.
[03:02:33.440 --> 03:02:34.220]  I 100% agree.
[03:02:34.240 --> 03:02:34.861]  Thank you so much.
[03:02:35.441 --> 03:02:36.481]  George in New Mexico.
[03:02:36.521 --> 03:02:36.841]  Go ahead.
[03:02:36.861 --> 03:02:37.402]  You're on the air.
[03:02:39.362 --> 03:02:40.303]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[03:02:41.163 --> 03:02:41.443]  Welcome.
[03:02:43.684 --> 03:02:48.946]  Yeah, so I was listening to the show today, and exciting time, like you said, to be alive.
[03:02:49.006 --> 03:02:52.928]  And, you know, it's good to see a little bit of unity
[03:02:53.906 --> 03:02:59.551]  In the states joining together, you know, especially when it's fueled by, you know, we the people, you know.
[03:03:01.113 --> 03:03:09.440]  And it's unfortunate, you know, your guest speaker today kind of broke it down on what they're actually seeing down there.
[03:03:09.801 --> 03:03:18.989]  You know, I don't think a lot of people realize the extent of the different dangers that we face, you know, with that crisis down there, you know, so.
[03:03:19.887 --> 03:03:20.528]  I agree with you.
[03:03:20.548 --> 03:03:24.771]  I think, you know, in whatever way we could come together, it ain't even really about the message.
[03:03:24.791 --> 03:03:26.072]  It's just about the message.
[03:03:26.092 --> 03:03:28.794]  You know, the message is we need a border.
[03:03:28.834 --> 03:03:36.260]  We need sovereignty in our nation, you know, and the danger that it imposes to our nation.
[03:03:36.280 --> 03:03:40.184]  You know, so God bless Texas for leading the way, you know.
[03:03:41.064 --> 03:03:47.710]  And it's unfortunate that right next door in my state, you know, my governor here, Michelle Lujan Grisham,
[03:03:48.436 --> 03:03:50.017]  She's doing the exact opposite.
[03:03:50.998 --> 03:03:54.340]  The border's wide open over here and everybody's welcome.
[03:03:56.122 --> 03:03:58.904]  She declined the National Guard down here.
[03:04:00.105 --> 03:04:07.470]  Unfortunately, it's an embarrassment to the nation, but God bless the other states for leading the way.
[03:04:08.111 --> 03:04:09.832]  Well, at least she's showing us who she is.
[03:04:12.234 --> 03:04:13.235]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:04:13.275 --> 03:04:15.096]  A lot of people are starting to wake up and
[03:04:15.854 --> 03:04:22.626]  You know, see her tyrannical policies and things that she's trying to impose over here, you know, especially around the Second Amendment.
[03:04:22.786 --> 03:04:24.909]  They're trying to take the guns and she got rebuked on that.
[03:04:25.290 --> 03:04:26.071]  Great point, George.
[03:04:26.111 --> 03:04:26.953]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:27.334 --> 03:04:28.035]  I'm going to go to break.
[03:04:28.095 --> 03:04:28.956]  Got one more call.
[03:04:30.071 --> 03:04:34.854]  Michael in North Carolina, then Drew Hernandez takes over for the balance of the hour.
[03:04:34.874 --> 03:04:36.536]  We'll skip a couple of breaks to get this time back.
[03:04:37.096 --> 03:04:41.819]  Please remember, ladies and gentlemen, the War Room with Owen Stroyer coming up 3 p.m.
[03:04:41.939 --> 03:04:46.703]  Central today in 55 minutes, 22 seconds from now.
[03:04:47.123 --> 03:04:54.068]  And we've got live coverage of everything happening at InfoWars.com, Band.Video, and Real Alex Jones on X.
[03:05:00.233 --> 03:05:01.653]  Last year we put this book out.
[03:05:02.494 --> 03:05:03.894]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[03:05:03.914 --> 03:05:05.694]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[03:05:06.275 --> 03:05:09.515]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[03:05:10.056 --> 03:05:10.956]  The Great Awakening.
[03:05:11.036 --> 03:05:14.897]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[03:05:15.297 --> 03:05:16.957]  This is such a powerful book.
[03:05:17.357 --> 03:05:19.038]  It covers all the globalist plans.
[03:05:19.718 --> 03:05:20.178]  We're good to go.
[03:05:38.854 --> 03:05:46.317]  This is next-level information, and it's a great way to not just support the broadcast, but inform yourself of the next level and share the book with friends and family.
[03:05:46.617 --> 03:05:52.999]  So whether you want one copy or multiple copies, go now to InfoWarsStore.com and get The Great Awakening.
[03:05:53.179 --> 03:05:54.400]  This is going to go to number one.
[03:05:54.420 --> 03:05:55.720]  I want to thank you for your support.
[03:05:55.900 --> 03:05:56.720]  It's a powerful book.
[03:05:56.941 --> 03:06:01.062]  Get your... The program leftists filled to silence.
[03:06:01.622 --> 03:06:03.223]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:08.643 --> 03:06:11.564]  It's Thursday, January 25th, 2024.
[03:06:11.944 --> 03:06:17.886]  We're into hour number four, and the great Drew Hernandez is set to take over here in mere minutes.
[03:06:18.326 --> 03:06:20.007]  But I promise you get every call on the board.
[03:06:20.367 --> 03:06:24.969]  So, final caller, our tail gunner from North Carolina.
[03:06:25.649 --> 03:06:26.229]  You're on the air.
[03:06:26.269 --> 03:06:26.689]  Go ahead.
[03:06:28.830 --> 03:06:29.410]  Yes, sir.
[03:06:29.470 --> 03:06:30.171]  Love you, brother.
[03:06:30.671 --> 03:06:31.071]  Love you, too.
[03:06:31.111 --> 03:06:31.311]  Go ahead.
[03:06:31.371 --> 03:06:34.012]  I'm calling to make this real short.
[03:06:35.419 --> 03:06:42.602]  I'm calling on our governor, North Carolina Cooper, regardless of party affiliation, to send the National Guard.
[03:06:43.443 --> 03:06:49.926]  If our state's attacked by illegals, once we dispose of them, we will be looking to hold him responsible.
[03:06:50.766 --> 03:06:57.849]  So I'm asking him to get off his hands and join the rest of the state and send the National Guard down to Texas.
[03:06:59.443 --> 03:07:03.305]  It was 15 states when I started the show three hours ago.
[03:07:03.725 --> 03:07:05.406]  Now 19 states back in Texas.
[03:07:05.426 --> 03:07:07.447]  What do you think about that?
[03:07:07.467 --> 03:07:08.648]  I think that's super.
[03:07:09.508 --> 03:07:12.170]  So, you know, I think your governor's doing the right thing.
[03:07:12.510 --> 03:07:13.070]  I'm behind him 100%.
[03:07:13.110 --> 03:07:15.752]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[03:07:15.772 --> 03:07:18.693]  What else is on your mind?
[03:07:18.933 --> 03:07:20.234]  I've got all your products.
[03:07:20.274 --> 03:07:21.655]  I've been a listener 18 years.
[03:07:21.695 --> 03:07:22.635]  First time caller.
[03:07:24.096 --> 03:07:27.878]  Not telling people to get off their medication because it might not work for everybody, but
[03:07:29.424 --> 03:07:34.045]  I'm a recovering drug addict and I almost died from it.
[03:07:36.486 --> 03:07:39.247]  God set me free from it.
[03:07:39.627 --> 03:07:43.468]  I've been on your products and I've felt better than I ever felt in my life.
[03:07:43.708 --> 03:07:46.029]  I got off all the medications they had me on.
[03:07:47.809 --> 03:07:51.090]  It's truly blessed me and it's helped me a lot.
[03:07:51.850 --> 03:07:54.191]  Your products are very good products.
[03:07:54.830 --> 03:07:57.675]  Michael, thank you for taking that step to support us.
[03:07:57.715 --> 03:07:58.135]  Thank you.
[03:07:58.696 --> 03:08:01.321]  Look, we have millions of viewers a day conservatively.
[03:08:01.441 --> 03:08:02.042]  Three or four million.
[03:08:02.222 --> 03:08:02.823]  That's a low number.
[03:08:03.524 --> 03:08:04.846]  It's much higher, but let's say four million.
[03:08:05.834 --> 03:08:07.055]  Less than 1% of our byproducts.
[03:08:07.675 --> 03:08:18.179]  We can hire more reporters, have crew everywhere, be doing incredible stuff, but we need listeners to say, hey, I'm going to go to InfoWarsStore.com, and I'm going to get a book.
[03:08:18.219 --> 03:08:18.779]  I'm going to get a film.
[03:08:18.799 --> 03:08:19.860]  I'm going to get water filtration.
[03:08:20.160 --> 03:08:21.160]  I'm going to get some supplements.
[03:08:21.180 --> 03:08:22.121]  They're all excellent.
[03:08:22.521 --> 03:08:24.942]  They all have great results, and you fund the operation.
[03:08:24.962 --> 03:08:26.942]  I want to thank the last caller for his support.
[03:08:26.962 --> 03:08:29.884]  I want to encourage everybody to go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:08:30.244 --> 03:08:32.965]  And one of our sponsors is DrJonesNaturals.com.
[03:08:34.244 --> 03:08:34.524]  Thank you.

[03:09:42.095 --> 03:09:43.036]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[03:09:43.056 --> 03:09:44.017]  I want everybody to get it.
[03:09:44.117 --> 03:09:51.842]  Please make the decision to fundraise for us and keep us on air and get the shirt, Team Humanity, two different versions, InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:09:52.322 --> 03:09:53.143]  We're going to skip this break.
[03:09:53.163 --> 03:09:55.004]  Coming up, Drew Hernandez takes over now.
[03:09:56.565 --> 03:09:57.505]  Alrighty, Alex Jones.
[03:09:57.525 --> 03:09:57.966]  Thank you guys.
[03:09:57.986 --> 03:10:01.568]  Welcome to the fourth hour of the most banned transmission in the universe.
[03:10:02.148 --> 03:10:02.929]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:10:02.949 --> 03:10:04.650]  I'm your guest host, Drew Hernandez.
[03:10:05.330 --> 03:10:10.494]  Many thousands, millions of patriots getting behind the Lone Star State, Texas, leading the charge.
[03:10:11.114 --> 03:10:13.596]  And yes, I'm seeing all over X. I'm seeing all over the news.
[03:10:13.616 --> 03:10:18.018]  A lot of people are very skeptical as to what Governor Greg Abbott's intentions are.
[03:10:18.118 --> 03:10:18.679]  However...
[03:10:19.279 --> 03:10:19.759]  We're good to go.
[03:10:47.193 --> 03:10:58.417]  And then post-January 6th and that operation that sealed the deal for them to carry that narrative all the way into the end zone touchdown score and they're all doing their touchdown dances.
[03:10:59.377 --> 03:11:13.742]  That gave them the ability to seal a narrative where they could install that and sear that in the minds of the psyche of millions of not only Americans but human beings worldwide through their propaganda and their fake news media channels, social media, you name it.
[03:11:14.386 --> 03:11:15.787]  So I think we've learned.
[03:11:16.207 --> 03:11:17.147]  I think we've learned.
[03:11:17.567 --> 03:11:23.150]  And I understand how a lot of people are skeptical of politicians, as you should be, and their actions.
[03:11:23.610 --> 03:11:37.976]  But at the same time, it shouldn't discourage us from exercising our First Amendment to peacefully gather and protest and express our grievances against a federal government, let alone a rogue, criminal, authoritarian federal government.
[03:11:38.156 --> 03:11:39.137]  So I think the movement...
[03:11:39.917 --> 03:11:49.202]  And I think the word for today is to be wise as serpents as we are dealing in the future when it comes to mass gatherings, when it comes to mass protests.
[03:11:49.562 --> 03:11:51.623]  I never want to encourage Americans.
[03:11:52.555 --> 03:11:53.856]  Or I'll say it differently.
[03:11:53.876 --> 03:11:59.922]  I never want to discourage Americans from exercising their First Amendment right because that is how we win.
[03:12:00.262 --> 03:12:02.364]  That is how America itself survives.
[03:12:02.404 --> 03:12:05.546]  That is how America itself... That is American culture.
[03:12:06.047 --> 03:12:10.431]  And so with the truck convoys that are upcoming in the next week that are going down...
[03:12:10.931 --> 03:12:16.595]  To the different locations in the southern border, Yuma, Eagle Pass in Texas, et cetera, and California as well.
[03:12:17.235 --> 03:12:20.437]  We're seeing this all over X. A lot of people are saying, well, is this a Fed op?
[03:12:20.497 --> 03:12:22.919]  How many Feds are going to infiltrate this operation?
[03:12:23.179 --> 03:12:25.240]  And I understand how people are thinking this way.
[03:12:25.680 --> 03:12:34.406]  And you should be skeptical of mass movements in the United States, but you shouldn't be discouraged to participate, to exercise your First Amendment right.
[03:12:34.806 --> 03:12:39.649]  You should just be extremely wise and calculated and have your eyes wide open and be extremely watchful
[03:12:40.510 --> 03:12:51.634]  As to who you're getting involved with and as to who is around you and as to who really is trying to encourage acts of violence or who really is trying to encourage acts that could be used and weaponized.
[03:12:51.654 --> 03:13:03.157]  They did the same thing with the trucker convoy in Canada a couple of years ago where they totally tried to weaponize that movement, paint them as Nazis and domestic terrorists and threats to everybody in Canada.
[03:13:03.417 --> 03:13:08.579]  And fast forward a few years later and now it's all coming out to the public and the general public of Canada.
[03:13:09.520 --> 03:13:17.367]  Well, actually, they had rights to be able to freely express themselves and protest the government because they weren't violent in any way, shape, or form.
[03:13:18.148 --> 03:13:20.370]  And so I think that is the future.
[03:13:20.670 --> 03:13:31.421]  And I think as we move forward as a movement, the Great Awakening is not only aware to Deep State, is not only aware to the New World Order, is not only aware...
[03:13:32.375 --> 03:14:00.278]  To their long-term operations, but understanding false flag events, not just from the perspective where you're watching Alex or you're watching Owen or Harrison, myself, or you name it on InfoWars, or your favorite based American truly red-pilled and anti-globalist radio or TV show host that has the ability to break down these globalist operations that are carried out over years, but also having the ability to identify these things on the ground.
[03:14:01.213 --> 03:14:10.223]  And I think we kind of saw that in the operation with January 6th, where people on the grounds weren't quite realizing just exactly what was happening.
[03:14:10.984 --> 03:14:12.426]  And we have to learn from our mistakes.
[03:14:13.027 --> 03:14:17.452]  We have to learn from what has happened in the past, so we don't re...
[03:14:18.701 --> 03:14:22.504]  I think we have every right to be overly cautious about who exactly that we're dealing with, okay?
[03:14:22.524 --> 03:14:22.964]  I mean, the most...
[03:14:37.356 --> 03:14:37.936]  We're good to go.
[03:14:55.374 --> 03:14:56.015]  We're good to go.
[03:14:56.055 --> 03:14:56.315]  I think?
[03:15:17.134 --> 03:15:22.755]  That approaches people and attempts to get them to stand down for a large sum of... Alex has even talked about this.
[03:15:22.795 --> 03:15:29.116]  I've done several interviews with Alex on various different shows and a lot of us have had these encounters.
[03:15:29.156 --> 03:15:46.800]  I've had my own encounters where people try to get me to stand down and people try to get me to sacrifice my Christian beliefs and my Christian values, which is my reality, for the sake of a large paycheck, for the sake of having a connection to a large network of
[03:15:47.260 --> 03:15:48.000]  We're good to go.
[03:16:16.128 --> 03:16:20.251]  We should be seeing hashtag StandWithTexas trending all over.
[03:16:20.291 --> 03:16:21.813]  This is a call out to the InfoWar.
[03:16:22.093 --> 03:16:26.336]  This is a call out to the InfoWarriors, not just on X, all of social media.
[03:16:26.636 --> 03:16:27.317]  Get it trending.
[03:16:27.617 --> 03:16:29.678]  Hashtag StandWithTexas.
[03:16:29.778 --> 03:16:32.280]  Hashtag StandWithTexas.
[03:16:32.300 --> 03:16:42.508]  We have multiple states, multiple governors getting behind the state of Texas for the simple reason and the core reason of defending American sovereignty.
[03:16:42.728 --> 03:16:43.108]  We're good to go.
[03:16:43.128 --> 03:16:43.848]  We're good to go.
[03:16:43.868 --> 03:16:44.549]  We're good to go.
[03:17:05.922 --> 03:17:06.543]  We're good to go.
[03:17:31.631 --> 03:17:33.492]  Even the airplanes are all woke and gay.
[03:17:34.432 --> 03:17:36.453]  They're blowing out mid-flight.
[03:17:37.014 --> 03:17:39.955]  You got huge holes blowing out in the middle of an airplane.
[03:17:40.735 --> 03:17:46.858]  Meanwhile, Alaskan Airlines is more concerned with having little miniature gay pride rallies in the freaking terminals.
[03:17:48.219 --> 03:18:01.005]  This is what the ESG, this is what the New World Order, total infiltration of total satanic just completely pushing degeneracy
[03:18:02.034 --> 03:18:02.575]  We're good to go.
[03:18:02.595 --> 03:18:02.855]  I think?
[03:18:20.652 --> 03:18:21.192]  We're good to go.
[03:18:48.860 --> 03:18:50.921]  And that's why this goes back to my point.
[03:18:51.622 --> 03:18:52.563]  They're desperate, guys.
[03:18:53.383 --> 03:18:53.683]  Okay?
[03:18:53.823 --> 03:18:55.044]  Joe Biden is nothing.
[03:18:55.705 --> 03:18:56.966]  Joe Biden is empty.
[03:18:57.466 --> 03:19:02.750]  Kamala Harris is a woke, retarded diversity hire that nobody can take serious.
[03:19:03.310 --> 03:19:06.692]  I don't know if you guys saw their first rally of the campaign of 2024.
[03:19:06.832 --> 03:19:09.774]  I think it was the same day of the primary.
[03:19:09.794 --> 03:19:10.715]  Of course you didn't see it.
[03:19:10.735 --> 03:19:12.977]  Because who the hell is watching a Biden rally, okay?
[03:19:14.398 --> 03:19:16.299]  The most staged thing is very similar to
[03:19:17.137 --> 03:19:17.457]  I don't know if
[03:19:35.288 --> 03:19:43.192]  Obviously, the same thing going on with Nikki Haley is the same thing going on with the Biden, the Biden regime, Kamala Harris, the unit party fully operated.
[03:19:43.252 --> 03:19:43.812]  What am I saying?
[03:19:43.832 --> 03:19:52.275]  What I'm saying is this is that isn't that that signals to me total desperation because they have no authentic support in this country.
[03:19:52.496 --> 03:19:53.236]  And we know that.
[03:19:54.398 --> 03:20:07.645]  So when you get these entities that have to result to acts and operations, whether it's psychological or kinetic ground operations through the feds or the intelligence agencies, maybe even the military, obviously the media, this is being run every single day.
[03:20:08.645 --> 03:20:12.747]  When these people get desperate, you start getting some 9-11 ops.
[03:20:13.308 --> 03:20:15.009]  You start getting some Pearl Harbor ops.
[03:20:15.049 --> 03:20:17.190]  You start Gulf of Tonkin ops.
[03:20:17.250 --> 03:20:21.512]  You start getting some serious operations where they are effective.
[03:20:22.219 --> 03:20:22.940]  We're good to go.
[03:20:22.960 --> 03:20:23.140]  I think?
[03:20:35.228 --> 03:20:49.580]  To turn public opinion against them, to make them look like they're the domestic terrorists, while at the same time they're importing the third world and you literally have Islamic terrorists infiltrating this country every single day, but somehow the mainstream narrative is, well, no, those are the good guys.
[03:20:49.880 --> 03:20:55.684]  They just want a better life and live the American dream, even though we say that's white supremacist and racist and it needs to go away.
[03:20:55.865 --> 03:20:57.025]  But anyways, don't mind that.
[03:20:57.246 --> 03:20:58.507]  That's just doublespeak.
[03:20:59.287 --> 03:21:02.730]  No, you need to take a look at the MAGA Republican right-wing domestic terrorists.
[03:21:03.331 --> 03:21:03.851]  Doesn't matter.
[03:21:04.625 --> 03:21:05.905]  They're all white supremacists.
[03:21:06.285 --> 03:21:07.586]  Like when Drew Hernandez is brown.
[03:21:07.626 --> 03:21:08.146]  Doesn't matter.
[03:21:08.186 --> 03:21:09.086]  White supremacist.
[03:21:09.866 --> 03:21:11.967]  Well, you got a black guy that loves Trump and he's MAGA.
[03:21:12.027 --> 03:21:12.647]  It doesn't matter.
[03:21:12.687 --> 03:21:13.807]  He's a white supremacist.
[03:21:14.068 --> 03:21:15.388]  Because it's all ideology.
[03:21:17.008 --> 03:21:24.750]  So as they go forward in this mode of desperation, my warning and my encouragement and my advice right now to the movement, and who am I?
[03:21:25.251 --> 03:21:26.771]  I'm just a voice in the wilderness, dude.
[03:21:27.378 --> 03:21:28.439]  I'm just giving my opinion.
[03:21:28.479 --> 03:21:32.302]  I'm just trying to give my advice because I care about America.
[03:21:32.402 --> 03:21:33.703]  I care about the InfoWar.
[03:21:33.763 --> 03:21:35.685]  I care about the InfoWarriors family.
[03:21:35.725 --> 03:21:40.108]  I care about the future of myself and my children and my children's children.
[03:21:40.128 --> 03:21:55.941]  And I could clearly see how advanced and sophisticated these people really are, especially after January 6th, especially after 9-11, especially after these very sophisticated government operations that have been successful, by the way, have been carried out.
[03:21:56.687 --> 03:21:57.647]  I think we're good to go.
[03:22:22.614 --> 03:22:23.174]  We're good to go.
[03:22:23.214 --> 03:22:23.675]  We're good to go.
[03:22:40.123 --> 03:22:43.906]  And this goes with provocateurs that I've seen show up at protesters.
[03:22:44.466 --> 03:22:51.851]  A protest that just stand around and wait for the right moment of some kind of conflict or a debate going on between two people.
[03:22:51.911 --> 03:22:55.993]  And they get in the way and they push someone into a police officer.
[03:22:56.033 --> 03:22:58.515]  And before you know it, an unlawful assembly is called.
[03:22:58.735 --> 03:23:04.379]  This is the kind of stuff I want to encourage people whenever you're out in the general public.
[03:23:05.308 --> 03:23:15.873]  Especially gathering for these political purposes for the United States of America, which isn't political, it's just this is reality for us, to be on the lookout for these type of operations.
[03:23:16.273 --> 03:23:17.534]  And here's why, okay?
[03:23:17.614 --> 03:23:18.334]  Here's why.
[03:23:18.834 --> 03:23:29.719]  And like Alex was saying earlier, which I totally agree with, is that I do think that they will launch some kind of false flag using these illegals.
[03:23:30.280 --> 03:23:32.721]  I refrain from calling them migrants because we don't even know
[03:23:33.470 --> 03:23:35.031]  Who the hell these people are, guys?
[03:23:35.512 --> 03:23:49.844]  Okay, I have some serious connections with some of the Texas National Guard, some of the Border Patrol agents, guys literally on the Rio Grande River, okay, that text me every single day, send me the numbers of the gotaways, the illegals that are coming in every single day.
[03:23:49.864 --> 03:23:55.488]  And any time I talk with these guys, it's worse than the reported numbers.
[03:23:55.548 --> 03:23:59.371]  It doesn't mean that they're being deceptive about the numbers that they're reporting.
[03:23:59.471 --> 03:24:02.014]  It's just that those are the numbers that they could confirm.
[03:24:02.074 --> 03:24:02.294]  That's it.
[03:24:03.274 --> 03:24:05.314]  That already has a prior record of offense or deportation.
[03:24:05.334 --> 03:24:05.515]  That's it.
[03:24:05.555 --> 03:24:05.815]  That's it.
[03:24:31.164 --> 03:24:31.704]  We're good to go.
[03:24:31.764 --> 03:24:32.105]  I think?
[03:24:57.671 --> 03:24:59.752]  Okay, so they probably, they already are.
[03:24:59.812 --> 03:25:00.833]  Take a look at the narrative.
[03:25:01.393 --> 03:25:07.237]  They already are weaponizing these people psychologically in the media by painting them as victims.
[03:25:07.297 --> 03:25:12.180]  And they've done this in Europe and in France and in Germany, where they are victims seeking a better life.
[03:25:12.460 --> 03:25:18.323]  And anybody that's attempting to speak out against their arrival or their occupation is simply xenophobic.
[03:25:18.644 --> 03:25:20.645]  And they go as far to say that's un-American.
[03:25:21.045 --> 03:25:21.986]  We're good to go.
[03:25:49.197 --> 03:26:05.313]  With all this said, analyzing this and watching the world and watching the direction of the deep state in my culture here in the United States of America that's been totally weaponized against anyone that stands for America, it's inevitable.
[03:26:06.374 --> 03:26:11.098]  It's inevitable that some kind of operation is on the horizon, especially in the year 2024.
[03:26:12.737 --> 03:26:13.338]  Here's why.
[03:26:13.358 --> 03:26:15.219]  And this goes back to my point.
[03:26:15.680 --> 03:26:18.002]  Biden is useless, has no support.
[03:26:18.322 --> 03:26:21.645]  Kamala Harris is useless and retarded and has no support.
[03:26:22.106 --> 03:26:23.407]  Nobody takes them serious.
[03:26:23.667 --> 03:26:27.210]  They have to synthetically prop up audiences to cheer for them.
[03:26:27.550 --> 03:26:35.318]  They're so desperate that they're going to their 2022 midterm narrative where this election is about a woman's right to choose.
[03:26:35.478 --> 03:26:36.539]  That's not even like...
[03:26:38.723 --> 03:26:39.103]  We're good to go.
[03:26:39.123 --> 03:26:39.263]  I think?
[03:27:00.993 --> 03:27:01.994]  So really think about it.
[03:27:02.674 --> 03:27:13.702]  This administration has nothing other than the false narrative that MAGA are right-wing extremist racist white supremacists that are a threat to our entire existence.
[03:27:14.523 --> 03:27:16.904]  So, to me, this is my opinion.
[03:27:16.924 --> 03:27:18.025]  I'm not calling for this.
[03:27:19.466 --> 03:27:23.169]  It only makes sense to me that there has to be some kind of event.
[03:27:24.130 --> 03:27:28.973]  There has to be some kind of event, some kind of false flag that
[03:27:29.696 --> 03:27:39.326]  That is in correlation with that issue that they could use, they could harness, repackage and weaponize against the entire movement.
[03:27:39.346 --> 03:27:41.589]  The indictments against Trump, not working.
[03:27:42.256 --> 03:27:43.057]  We're good to go.
[03:27:43.097 --> 03:27:43.337]  I think?
[03:28:07.230 --> 03:28:11.651]  All of these attacks, since he came down the escalator in 2015, have only made him more powerful.
[03:28:11.711 --> 03:28:12.391]  We all know that.
[03:28:13.011 --> 03:28:15.692]  So as they get desperate, they're going to increase their efforts.
[03:28:16.672 --> 03:28:17.912]  They're very sophisticated.
[03:28:18.312 --> 03:28:28.534]  So I think the movement, eyes wide open, head on a swivel, man, because in their moments of desperation, they have to roll something out.
[03:28:29.554 --> 03:28:32.955]  That's in correlation with what's going on with the top two issues in this nation.
[03:28:33.235 --> 03:28:35.175]  And they are the ones who have caused this.
[03:28:36.622 --> 03:28:42.628]  So these are masters of propaganda and operations weaponizing against humanity.
[03:28:43.028 --> 03:28:43.789]  So be on the lookout.
[03:28:43.849 --> 03:28:45.150]  I have a lot more to say about this.
[03:28:45.190 --> 03:28:46.452]  We have a break coming up, guys.
[03:28:47.072 --> 03:28:47.993]  So make sure.
[03:28:48.033 --> 03:28:48.514]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:28:48.534 --> 03:28:50.456]  If you guys are watching on X, share the broadcast.
[03:28:50.476 --> 03:28:51.156]  Fan.video.
[03:28:51.196 --> 03:28:52.397]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:28:52.558 --> 03:28:53.398]  Support the broadcast.
[03:28:53.418 --> 03:28:54.159]  We'll be right back.
[03:28:54.199 --> 03:28:54.840]  Do not go anywhere.
[03:28:56.698 --> 03:28:58.259]  I'm not on Team NFL.
[03:28:58.560 --> 03:29:00.061]  I'm not on Team NBA.
[03:29:00.241 --> 03:29:01.202]  I'm not on Team Olympics.
[03:29:01.503 --> 03:29:04.926]  I'm not on Team Globalist or Wokeism in the New World Order.
[03:29:05.166 --> 03:29:15.396]  I'm on Team Humanity, ladies and gentlemen, that loves God and loves our families and loves humanity and knows that we're destined to do even more incredible things than we've already done together.
[03:29:15.576 --> 03:29:21.802]  And so, inspired by my conversation with Elon Musk recently, where he agreed with my idea to call it Team Humanity,
[03:29:22.082 --> 03:29:26.565]  We've launched two limited edition t-shirts at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:29:26.846 --> 03:29:30.809]  Let people know that, hey, it isn't about the football games or it isn't even about the UFC.
[03:29:31.289 --> 03:29:35.332]  It's about team humanity being under globalist attack.
[03:29:35.652 --> 03:29:37.073]  You can wear it.
[03:29:37.333 --> 03:29:39.015]  It's a great conversation starter.
[03:29:39.375 --> 03:29:45.660]  And you know it's supporting the InfoWar that is at the very tip of the spear in the fight for team humanity.
[03:29:45.980 --> 03:29:50.023]  Get your limited edition team humanity t-shirts right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:29:50.123 --> 03:29:50.623]  And I thank you.
[03:29:57.032 --> 03:30:03.893]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the globalist agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[03:30:04.774 --> 03:30:17.776]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections, masquerading as vaccines.
[03:30:17.936 --> 03:30:22.857]  It is so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives oblivious.
[03:30:24.249 --> 03:30:26.018]  And you realize Ingrid's not blessed.
[03:30:26.219 --> 03:30:26.963]  It equals death.
[03:30:28.607 --> 03:30:49.018]  But people are starting to really understand how serious things are, and that's a hard thing to do, because to wake up to a disturbing reality and realize that we're in the middle of a giant biological weapons war against humanity, and that there's mass sterilization that's already taking place, cutting off all the major energy sources, is really hard to deal with, but it's the reality.
[03:30:49.598 --> 03:30:53.760]  Facing it is our only chance to turn this around, because stuff's about to get really, really nasty.
[03:30:54.180 --> 03:30:54.821]  Infowars.com.
[03:30:57.921 --> 03:31:01.042]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:31:01.062 --> 03:31:02.583]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:31:03.343 --> 03:31:06.404]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:31:07.285 --> 03:31:15.368]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:31:16.208 --> 03:31:24.011]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:31:25.023 --> 03:31:27.925]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:31:28.665 --> 03:31:33.667]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:31:34.448 --> 03:31:35.368]  I know you spread the word.
[03:31:35.408 --> 03:31:36.889]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[03:31:36.929 --> 03:31:37.449]  Keep doing it.
[03:31:37.489 --> 03:31:45.774]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[03:31:46.434 --> 03:31:50.016]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:31:50.716 --> 03:31:55.357]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Enforcement.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:31:55.677 --> 03:31:56.517]  Please take action now.
[03:31:56.697 --> 03:31:58.978]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[03:31:59.138 --> 03:31:59.478]  Thank you.
[03:31:59.678 --> 03:32:02.239]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[03:32:02.299 --> 03:32:03.559]  I started taking that stuff.
[03:32:03.599 --> 03:32:06.800]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[03:32:06.920 --> 03:32:07.800]  When did you start taking it?
[03:32:08.080 --> 03:32:11.961]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure, and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[03:32:11.981 --> 03:32:12.221]  Mm-hmm.
[03:32:12.641 --> 03:32:12.801]  Mm-hmm.
[03:32:12.822 --> 03:32:12.942]  Mm-hmm.
[03:32:29.036 --> 03:32:42.901]  And even though I do think all your other products are good, I recommend to anybody that they start with X2 iodine because it detoxifies your body and kind of kicks your natural DNA into full force.
[03:32:43.001 --> 03:32:46.482]  So in my life, I found X2 iodine the best.
[03:32:46.942 --> 03:32:50.383]  I tried other iodines and they didn't have the same effect.
[03:32:50.683 --> 03:32:52.984]  So X2 iodine, I really wanted to point that out.
[03:32:58.109 --> 03:33:04.071]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:05.591 --> 03:33:20.795]  Hashtag stand with Texas, the battle for American sovereignty.
[03:33:21.095 --> 03:33:21.915]  That's what this is about.
[03:33:22.735 --> 03:33:25.696]  This is why every state in the union needs to support
[03:33:26.852 --> 03:33:28.552]  What Texas is doing by leading the charge.
[03:33:53.234 --> 03:34:08.335]  And also, yes, as Alex mentioned earlier, I will be going down to the formerly known southern border in Texas, not this weekend, but the next weekend, on behalf of InfoWars, Band.Video, InfoWarsStore.com, and that's only made possible by you guys.
[03:34:08.855 --> 03:34:09.435]  We're good to go.
[03:34:09.475 --> 03:34:09.616]  I think?
[03:34:25.805 --> 03:34:28.928]  I want to encourage every single one of you guys to go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:34:29.248 --> 03:34:31.009]  Make sure to purchase some of the great products.
[03:34:31.349 --> 03:34:33.691]  There are a lot of great sales going on right now.
[03:34:33.711 --> 03:34:36.353]  I want to encourage all of you guys to get into the fight.
[03:34:36.754 --> 03:34:39.236]  Support every single one of us here in the InfoWar.
[03:34:39.716 --> 03:34:40.256]  Do your part.
[03:34:40.296 --> 03:34:48.623]  We're thankful for those of you that have over the years and those of you that will and continue to support us here at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:34:48.723 --> 03:34:50.044]  Van.videos, share the links.
[03:34:50.524 --> 03:34:54.968]  All right, continuing with my thoughts, because this is kind of like a long, drawn-out thought.
[03:34:55.720 --> 03:35:11.023]  You know, listening to Alex the past, you know, couple hours on this subject of Texas leading the charge, and I understand people don't trust Abbott, but I've been getting text messages from guys down on the Rio Grande, Border Patrol agents.
[03:35:12.043 --> 03:35:17.484]  Behind the scenes, they kind of feel the same way I've been hearing, but however, they do believe it's the right move.
[03:35:18.344 --> 03:35:20.264]  That's kind of like the inside stuff I can give you.
[03:35:20.304 --> 03:35:23.585]  I can't disclose who they are because I've got to protect their identities.
[03:35:24.601 --> 03:35:34.309]  What I am hearing on the inside is that they do kind of think, obviously, this should have been done a lot earlier, but at least the right move was finally made.
[03:35:35.529 --> 03:35:41.174]  And like I said, I personally don't trust Abbott, but I think the move was right.
[03:35:41.534 --> 03:35:42.715]  Do I think that the move...
[03:35:43.328 --> 03:35:45.610]  It was a little too late, absolutely.
[03:35:45.630 --> 03:35:51.013]  I think millions of people could have been prevented by a move like this early on.
[03:35:51.934 --> 03:35:53.214]  However, I will say this.
[03:35:53.535 --> 03:35:54.615]  I will say this, okay?
[03:35:56.416 --> 03:36:05.863]  There are several on-the-ground border reporters that are down there all the time, a lot of my friends, and that actually are in Mexico.
[03:36:06.083 --> 03:36:09.225]  I mean, you guys have guys like Michael Yan, Ben Berquam,
[03:36:10.100 --> 03:36:14.682]  Oscar Blue, just to name a few, Jorge Ventura, Julio Rojas.
[03:36:15.103 --> 03:36:16.643]  The crew is always down there.
[03:36:17.524 --> 03:36:18.524]  Bill Malusian with Fox.
[03:36:19.405 --> 03:36:25.908]  And what I'm hearing from a lot of the guys down there, from some of them, is that there are caravans on the way.
[03:36:27.429 --> 03:36:30.511]  Some of them have just left the southern border of Mexico.
[03:36:30.571 --> 03:36:34.833]  They're en route to the southern border of the United States right now.
[03:36:35.550 --> 03:36:36.150]  We're good to go.
[03:36:36.210 --> 03:36:37.151]  We're good to go.
[03:37:03.504 --> 03:37:04.925]  But this stand is necessary.
[03:37:05.205 --> 03:37:05.726]  So I'll say this.
[03:37:05.826 --> 03:37:09.008]  I'll say this to give Abbott the benefit of the doubt.
[03:37:09.568 --> 03:37:10.509]  What I'll say is this.
[03:37:10.849 --> 03:37:13.831]  Let's see what happens when the next wave of caravans come.
[03:37:13.851 --> 03:37:16.233]  Because they're on the way, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:37:17.134 --> 03:37:20.756]  We'll see what happens when the next wave of caravans come.
[03:37:21.877 --> 03:37:22.998]  Will the line be held?
[03:37:23.518 --> 03:37:32.385]  Will Governor Greg Abbott hold this line and continue to hold this line and defy this tyrannical, criminal, rogue federal government?
[03:37:33.368 --> 03:37:34.589]  It's because it's been kind of quiet.
[03:37:35.690 --> 03:37:39.194]  And there are more caravans en route on the way.
[03:37:39.214 --> 03:37:41.196]  What day will they touch down?
[03:37:41.216 --> 03:37:48.062]  We're not sure, but that's why we're going to go down next weekend to cover especially what's going on with the convoy as well.
[03:37:49.103 --> 03:37:57.812]  But we will see how the state of Texas, and what I mean by the state of Texas is how Governor Greg Abbott will handle the next wave of
[03:37:58.790 --> 03:37:59.711]  Of illegals.
[03:37:59.951 --> 03:38:01.632]  I'm talking like a wave of like thousands.
[03:38:01.973 --> 03:38:04.975]  I'm talking about these massive caravans that are en route.
[03:38:05.515 --> 03:38:07.637]  And I think from there, we'll really see.
[03:38:07.917 --> 03:38:23.508]  OK, because like I said, Governor Greg Abbott making the right decision, holding the line for Texas, defying a rogue federal criminal government by drawing that line, by obeying and defending the state with Constitution right out in front of you.
[03:38:23.828 --> 03:38:24.749]  That's the right move.
[03:38:25.820 --> 03:38:26.341]  We're good to go.
[03:38:26.361 --> 03:38:27.021]  We're good to go.
[03:38:48.815 --> 03:38:55.900]  Standing behind the Constitution, defending ourselves from a rogue, tyrannical federal government, that is the right move.
[03:38:56.961 --> 03:38:59.702]  That is the right move, and that's where we need to be right now.
[03:38:59.743 --> 03:39:09.869]  So this brings me back to my point with what I think this rogue, criminal federal government is going to roll with in the future because that's their track record.
[03:39:10.330 --> 03:39:11.450]  They need something, guys.
[03:39:12.211 --> 03:39:13.572]  They really need something.
[03:39:14.184 --> 03:39:15.025]  They don't have anything.
[03:39:15.065 --> 03:39:17.506]  There's no substance.
[03:39:17.566 --> 03:39:22.349]  There's no message accompanying the Biden campaign right now.
[03:39:22.970 --> 03:39:26.672]  Nothing other than the power of women.
[03:39:27.332 --> 03:39:30.034]  They're going to know the power of women soon.
[03:39:30.414 --> 03:39:34.297]  It's your right to choose to slaughter and kill your baby in and outside of the womb.
[03:39:34.597 --> 03:39:37.959]  That's what we're going for in 2024 against Trump.
[03:39:40.221 --> 03:39:41.442]  I think that's the surface level.
[03:39:42.562 --> 03:39:43.483]  There's a reason why
[03:39:44.377 --> 03:39:44.537]  I think?
[03:40:11.113 --> 03:40:15.558]  Okay, weaponizing the federal government against people that were there on the Capitol outside?
[03:40:15.578 --> 03:40:19.222]  On the Capitol lawn, on the grounds, hundreds of feet away?
[03:40:20.316 --> 03:40:24.479]  I could have just been sitting there chilling, smoking a cigarette, I don't know, eating a sandwich.
[03:40:25.299 --> 03:40:26.460]  This is what I'm trying to tell you guys.
[03:40:26.520 --> 03:40:32.664]  It's like, these are acts, these are rogue criminal acts of serious desperation and paranoia.
[03:40:33.084 --> 03:40:34.385]  That's why they're getting this way.
[03:40:34.605 --> 03:40:36.006]  Because they know they're losing.
[03:40:36.046 --> 03:40:41.929]  They're losing the grip of the minds of millions of people, not just in America, but worldwide.
[03:40:43.090 --> 03:40:46.532]  And as they get more desperate, and as they get more paranoid...
[03:40:47.398 --> 03:40:50.640]  The sophistication of their operations is going to increase.
[03:40:50.660 --> 03:40:56.223]  And I think that's what we're going to have to face in 2024.
[03:40:56.283 --> 03:40:57.524]  So I just want to put that out there.
[03:40:57.544 --> 03:41:02.087]  I want to put that out there now for the movement, especially with this convoy coming out.
[03:41:02.107 --> 03:41:05.749]  I don't want to discourage people from peacefully protesting because we need that.
[03:41:05.969 --> 03:41:07.149]  That's what they fear, by the way.
[03:41:07.730 --> 03:41:09.111]  That's why they have to infiltrate it.
[03:41:09.951 --> 03:41:11.172]  That's why they have to subvert it.
[03:41:12.232 --> 03:41:14.694]  That's why the feds have to get in and make it violent.
[03:41:16.337 --> 03:41:18.117]  Because they hate the First Amendment.
[03:41:19.058 --> 03:41:19.638]  Why do they hate it?
[03:41:19.838 --> 03:41:20.798]  Because it is peaceful.
[03:41:21.958 --> 03:41:22.558]  Why do they hate it?
[03:41:22.578 --> 03:41:33.300]  Because it shows that a truly democratic and a truly constitutional republic can function peacefully, respectfully, and maturely.
[03:41:33.780 --> 03:41:34.580]  That could happen.
[03:41:35.060 --> 03:41:37.321]  And they know that, and they hate that, and they fear that.
[03:41:37.561 --> 03:41:42.882]  That's why they have to get in with their plants, with their feds, and their infiltrators.
[03:41:43.769 --> 03:41:45.550]  And cause acts.
[03:41:45.710 --> 03:41:46.470]  Really view it that way.
[03:41:46.490 --> 03:41:47.510]  I think that's the best way to put it.
[03:41:47.530 --> 03:42:00.494]  Whenever you guys are out on the ground, you're at a protest, you're at some kind of political gathering, no matter where you are, you see these strange anomalies of violence or fighting or some kind of confrontation with police officers.
[03:42:01.854 --> 03:42:08.456]  They may not necessarily be feds or sent by the federal government, but they very well may be an Antifa organization.
[03:42:09.712 --> 03:42:16.977]  ...infiltrator or some kind of radical political communist agitator that will get arrested but get a pass.
[03:42:16.997 --> 03:42:20.620]  That stuff is fully operational, especially now in 2024.
[03:42:20.680 --> 03:42:30.507]  So I want to encourage people to be on the lookout for that, no matter where you're at, especially in America, because they need something, guys.
[03:42:30.527 --> 03:42:33.689]  They're in this mode of desperation...
[03:42:37.054 --> 03:42:41.758]  Where even their psychological lies through the media, that's not sticking.
[03:42:42.358 --> 03:42:43.619]  They need something kinetic.
[03:42:43.680 --> 03:42:45.341]  They need something tangible.
[03:42:45.801 --> 03:42:50.685]  They need something they could point to and say, see, that is what we were telling you guys about.
[03:42:51.046 --> 03:43:05.938]  That's undeniable, and that's why you need to turn your back on everything that that represents in their own spinned narrative and propagated, twisted, perverted definition of what we are as Christians and
[03:43:06.619 --> 03:43:10.563]  MAGA, The Great Awakening, Info Warriors, Patriots, you name it, correct?
[03:43:12.805 --> 03:43:23.294]  And these are sophisticated levels of psychological operations also on the ground that I think the patriot of the future has to be able to identify.
[03:43:24.835 --> 03:43:33.323]  Especially with the use of technology and AI and bots and algorithms on social media propping up narratives.
[03:43:34.133 --> 03:43:34.693]  We're good to go.
[03:43:34.713 --> 03:43:34.893]  I think?
[03:43:58.215 --> 03:44:04.980]  What makes us think that they won't increase these levels of operations, especially right now where they already have?
[03:44:05.641 --> 03:44:13.787]  Okay, this replacement migration agenda and operation, it's not something that we have to look out for anymore.
[03:44:14.207 --> 03:44:16.589]  It's not something that we have to be ready for.
[03:44:17.170 --> 03:44:20.052]  It's not something that, okay, well, now we know what it is.
[03:44:20.859 --> 03:44:28.120]  We're assured that it's real because they've rolled it out in France and Germany and Europe and several different countries in the East.
[03:44:30.061 --> 03:44:32.801]  No, it's already happened.
[03:44:34.281 --> 03:44:35.782]  It's already happened.
[03:44:35.802 --> 03:44:38.442]  It's already being carried out on a daily basis.
[03:44:38.962 --> 03:44:41.983]  And there are millions of people that do not belong here in this country.
[03:44:42.243 --> 03:44:44.043]  And they will be activated as well.
[03:44:44.503 --> 03:44:45.264]  Drew, how do you know that?
[03:44:45.284 --> 03:44:47.544]  Dude, look what they did in France just last year.
[03:44:48.527 --> 03:44:50.829]  It's been happening in Germany and Ireland.
[03:44:51.869 --> 03:45:01.536]  You have all of these Muslim women in Ireland complaining that the Irish men are disrespectful and their culture is just really disrespectful because they joke too much.
[03:45:01.556 --> 03:45:02.537]  You guys have seen the clips.
[03:45:03.838 --> 03:45:04.879]  That's why they're sent there.
[03:45:04.919 --> 03:45:16.587]  These illegals are sent there to destroy the culture because they've been sent to replace the culture by replacing the population that has adopted and created and cultivated and preserved that culture.
[03:45:16.887 --> 03:45:17.408]  You understand?
[03:45:18.982 --> 03:45:21.263]  And so America is already going through that sequence.
[03:45:22.503 --> 03:45:25.064]  And this is why Trump is imperative, and this is why they need to stop Trump.
[03:45:25.524 --> 03:45:27.245]  Because Trump has already made himself clear.
[03:45:27.265 --> 03:45:38.608]  I don't know if you guys have noticed, but I have in the primary, this circus of a primary, Trump is the only one that has come out and really made it very clear.
[03:45:38.728 --> 03:45:40.368]  Mass deportations immediately.
[03:45:40.729 --> 03:45:42.429]  Mass deportations immediately.
[03:45:42.449 --> 03:45:45.150]  I don't even think Vivek got that aggressive.
[03:45:46.147 --> 03:45:46.907]  Correct me if I'm wrong.
[03:45:46.947 --> 03:45:49.709]  I may be wrong on that one, but I didn't really listen to that guy a lot.
[03:45:50.269 --> 03:45:51.370]  It's Trump's year.
[03:45:51.390 --> 03:45:51.730]  It's Trump 2024.
[03:45:51.790 --> 03:45:53.110]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:45:53.551 --> 03:45:54.851]  Everyone had to fall in line.
[03:45:55.191 --> 03:45:55.892]  Thankful they did.
[03:45:56.272 --> 03:45:57.172]  Vivek fell in line.
[03:45:57.232 --> 03:45:58.373]  DeSantis fell in line.
[03:45:58.673 --> 03:46:01.795]  Nikki Haley can't fall in line because she's a uniparty operative.
[03:46:01.835 --> 03:46:03.155]  She's a political prostitute.
[03:46:03.976 --> 03:46:10.259]  But when it comes to this issue of illegal immigration, there should be a zero-tolerance policy, mass deportations.
[03:46:11.399 --> 03:46:15.161]  And that's why I support Trump for 2024 because that's exactly where we need to be.
[03:46:16.542 --> 03:46:16.702]  I think?
[03:46:35.945 --> 03:46:41.928]  They need an event that they can point to that corroborates the narrative they've been cultivating for the past seven years.
[03:46:42.589 --> 03:46:46.330]  That all of us are right-wing domestic terrorists and it all becomes a reality.
[03:46:46.351 --> 03:46:51.573]  They had one at J6 and they need another one in 2024.
[03:46:52.754 --> 03:47:00.178]  And I think it's safe to say it will probably coincide along with what's going on with illegal immigration and the migrants.
[03:47:00.838 --> 03:47:02.879]  I mean, really think about how dangerous this is getting.
[03:47:03.600 --> 03:47:04.180]  You have these
[03:47:05.313 --> 03:47:16.417]  These Muslims that are coming in, and this was mentioned by one of the callers earlier, and Alex, I think it's on Bandot Video, where this guy is at the southern border, and to me it sounded like a threat to a journalist.
[03:47:16.457 --> 03:47:17.438]  Oh, you'll find out who I am.
[03:47:17.458 --> 03:47:18.198]  You'll know who I am.
[03:47:18.218 --> 03:47:19.798]  Yeah, you'll know who I am.
[03:47:20.499 --> 03:47:22.499]  I'm way better than just living off of benefits.
[03:47:22.519 --> 03:47:23.560]  You'll find out who I am.
[03:47:23.580 --> 03:47:26.361]  Okay, and you literally have illegals.
[03:47:27.617 --> 03:47:29.058]  You have Haitian illegals.
[03:47:29.118 --> 03:47:30.238]  I think it was in Boston.
[03:47:30.258 --> 03:47:32.400]  I'm pretty sure the crew could find this somewhere.
[03:47:32.420 --> 03:47:33.280]  I think it was in Boston.
[03:47:33.320 --> 03:47:38.683]  A Haitian illegal literally raped an autistic girl and then murdered her.
[03:47:40.104 --> 03:47:47.868]  And then elsewhere, you have illegals that are raping the mentally and physically disabled in this country.
[03:47:49.609 --> 03:47:51.650]  This is just like scratching the surface.
[03:47:52.570 --> 03:47:53.871]  There will be no justice for them.
[03:47:53.891 --> 03:47:55.872]  That's part of the depopulation.
[03:47:56.883 --> 03:48:18.127]  Okay, there will be no arm of the law that will come in because, by the way, those two stories I just cited, those are two individuals that already had prior offenses and the organizations within these respective states called for the deportation and the arrest of this individual but was denied and they stayed in the United States to re-offend again.
[03:48:18.367 --> 03:48:19.807]  See, that's by design, guys.
[03:48:20.747 --> 03:48:22.708]  And like, what's it really going to take, honestly?
[03:48:22.928 --> 03:48:24.288]  Like, what's it really going to take
[03:48:25.313 --> 03:48:28.516]  And this is why it's so essential to get behind Texas right now.
[03:48:28.536 --> 03:48:31.418]  It doesn't matter what your political affiliation is.
[03:48:31.758 --> 03:48:32.739]  It really doesn't matter.
[03:48:33.079 --> 03:48:37.002]  You think these illegals, you think Klaus Schwab cares whether you're a Democrat or a Republican?
[03:48:37.042 --> 03:48:37.622]  Give me a break.
[03:48:38.583 --> 03:48:45.308]  You think someone like Bill Gates gives a damn whether you're a part of the DNC or whether you're a part of the GOP?
[03:48:46.429 --> 03:48:51.233]  You think these very powerful elites and these globalist psychopaths and sociopaths
[03:48:52.119 --> 03:48:57.981]  You think people like John Kerry give a damn whether you identify as a conservative or a liberal?
[03:48:58.862 --> 03:48:59.662]  They don't care at all.
[03:49:00.602 --> 03:49:04.504]  All they care about is, are you going along with us or not?
[03:49:04.524 --> 03:49:04.864]  I don't care.
[03:49:06.124 --> 03:49:10.406]  I just care about, where do you stand on this issue?
[03:49:11.286 --> 03:49:12.967]  Are you with us or against us?
[03:49:13.167 --> 03:49:14.107]  That's how simple it is.
[03:49:14.327 --> 03:49:17.549]  Like quite literally what Jesus said, you're either for me or you're against me.
[03:49:18.129 --> 03:49:19.990]  The satanic globalist elite are the same way.
[03:49:20.410 --> 03:49:21.830]  You're either for them or you're against them.
[03:49:21.870 --> 03:49:23.131]  There really is no middle ground.
[03:49:24.131 --> 03:49:29.053]  That's why this whole uniparty, two-party system PSYOP is a problem.
[03:49:29.454 --> 03:49:30.854]  Because it's confusing people.
[03:49:31.254 --> 03:49:37.497]  And it's causing people to believe that this simulated reality of two sides of a functioning system
[03:49:38.132 --> 03:49:56.147]  Democratic Constitutional Republic are actually debating in the public town square, and that's why things change, and we may not always get what we want, but at least we're still functioning as a nation, and we have the ability to come to the table and debate ideas and progress one way or progress another way, but at least we're moving forward as Americans.
[03:49:56.367 --> 03:50:03.173]  That's not what America is right now, in case you haven't noticed, okay?
[03:50:03.553 --> 03:50:04.894]  These people don't give a damn.
[03:50:04.934 --> 03:50:06.816]  They don't care what you identify as.
[03:50:09.813 --> 03:50:13.396]  They just want to know are you with us or are you against us?
[03:50:14.137 --> 03:50:17.319]  You could claim to be a Christian, but what are you actually about?
[03:50:19.301 --> 03:50:21.903]  You could claim to be anything, but what are you actually about?
[03:50:22.824 --> 03:50:25.726]  And this is why people are so skeptical of Governor Greg Abbott.
[03:50:25.786 --> 03:50:27.207]  I get it with his WEF connections.
[03:50:27.568 --> 03:50:28.088]  I get it.
[03:50:28.208 --> 03:50:28.889]  I understand it.
[03:50:28.909 --> 03:50:30.150]  It makes sense to me.
[03:50:30.925 --> 03:50:44.655]  And I think we should be because we as Americans have been so psyoped for so long and part of the Great Awakening I think is going to accompany a level of discernment and skepticism with anyone that claims to be on your side.
[03:50:45.015 --> 03:50:45.535]  I get that.
[03:50:46.436 --> 03:50:49.058]  And I'm not going to shame anybody for thinking that because that makes sense to me.
[03:50:49.718 --> 03:50:56.623]  We've been lied to for so long anyone that steps to the table and claims to be I'm on your side.
[03:50:56.723 --> 03:50:57.544]  I'm here.
[03:50:58.324 --> 03:50:59.165]  Here I am.
[03:50:59.918 --> 03:51:00.318]  We're good to go.
[03:51:29.111 --> 03:51:29.591]  Maybe.
[03:51:29.851 --> 03:51:30.291]  Maybe.
[03:51:31.372 --> 03:51:40.854]  And maybe this will be a move for more support for Greg Abbott for a re-election upcoming in a midterm scenario.
[03:51:41.955 --> 03:51:42.815]  I don't know.
[03:51:42.915 --> 03:51:44.055]  I don't know the man's motives.
[03:51:44.175 --> 03:51:46.476]  All I know is that this is the right move.
[03:51:47.296 --> 03:51:51.817]  And I'm talking to some Border Patrol agents behind the scenes that feel the exact same way.
[03:51:52.658 --> 03:51:55.058]  And I think right now this move needs to be supported.
[03:51:55.999 --> 03:51:57.319]  And right now acts of peace...
[03:51:58.687 --> 03:51:59.307]  We're good to go.
[03:51:59.327 --> 03:51:59.728]  I think?
[03:52:25.504 --> 03:52:30.826]  Because nobody likes to see innocent people getting absolutely destroyed over nothing.
[03:52:31.767 --> 03:52:36.468]  And I think this move, we have an opportunity to do this right here with what's going on in Texas.
[03:52:37.389 --> 03:52:42.811]  So I do encourage people, if you get involved with any protests, especially in 2024, remain peaceful.
[03:52:43.851 --> 03:52:46.733]  Because right now we have a desperate, that's what they need that.
[03:52:48.348 --> 03:52:49.229]  That's the point here.
[03:52:49.929 --> 03:52:54.633]  This rogue criminal federal government, they need a spark of violence.
[03:52:55.253 --> 03:52:59.957]  And they will turn that into an absolute worldwide controlled wildfire.
[03:53:02.099 --> 03:53:08.464]  And I think strategically, if we gave that to them this year, it would have them huge, huge...
[03:53:10.956 --> 03:53:15.297]  Media, narrative power, psychological operations would be carried out everywhere.
[03:53:15.858 --> 03:53:21.960]  It would give them more excuses to weaponize the feds and have public perception where it's received and accepted.
[03:53:21.980 --> 03:53:24.080]  You understand?
[03:53:24.100 --> 03:53:34.324]  That's why when they went with the J6 trials and they went with the J6 political prosecution of those that have been sent to D.C.
[03:53:34.364 --> 03:53:38.585]  gulags and they went with the operation to seek and
[03:53:39.756 --> 03:53:43.137]  Arrest and convict anyone involved with all of this.
[03:53:43.157 --> 03:53:45.058]  I think it's very clear.
[03:53:45.078 --> 03:53:50.799]  I think it's very clear that as they continue, that that is what they need to do.
[03:53:50.819 --> 03:53:56.701]  And I think right now, if we give them another one, it's only going to make them more powerful.
[03:53:57.521 --> 03:54:03.163]  And I think an act of peace right now, which makes total sense to me, because it forces their hand.
[03:54:03.823 --> 03:54:04.623]  It forces...
[03:54:07.270 --> 03:54:09.732]  I think that's a huge red pill moment for people.
[03:54:09.752 --> 03:54:10.872]  I really do.
[03:54:11.053 --> 03:54:13.374]  I think that's really hard to argue with.
[03:54:13.414 --> 03:54:16.016]  And they're already trying to spin that narrative, by the way.
[03:54:16.076 --> 03:54:17.177]  That's why Democrats and
[03:54:39.185 --> 03:54:52.208]  Democrat Republicans, excuse me, Democrat Congressmen, excuse me, are already calling Beta O'Rourke, that Beta and Cuck, is already calling for Biden to come in and drop the hammer.
[03:54:52.668 --> 03:54:53.788]  Come in and drop the hammer.
[03:54:53.808 --> 03:54:57.008]  They literally want Biden to send the military.
[03:54:57.068 --> 03:54:57.729]  That's what they want.
[03:54:59.209 --> 03:55:05.770]  They want Biden to send the military, okay, to seize control of the Texas National Guard, to seize control of
[03:55:06.405 --> 03:55:08.286]  All right, of the autonomy of the state of Texas.
[03:55:08.386 --> 03:55:09.567]  That's what they want.
[03:55:10.748 --> 03:55:12.769]  Am I saying just let them do that to us?
[03:55:13.089 --> 03:55:24.936]  What I'm saying is let the optic be shown that that's how far they're willing to take it, and then watch the public support really get on board with the United States of America.
[03:55:24.956 --> 03:55:26.958]  And like I said, don't get it twisted.
[03:55:27.018 --> 03:55:28.258]  I'm all for self-defense.
[03:55:28.859 --> 03:55:30.540]  We oppose tyranny at all costs.
[03:55:31.560 --> 03:55:32.021]  But I think...
[03:55:33.470 --> 03:55:49.661]  If we play this smart, if we allow them to play their hand of continuing to show how far they're really willing to go with their authoritarian, full-blown, big-brother government overreach, I think that's why you're seeing so many governors.
[03:55:50.141 --> 03:55:50.561]  I don't know who.
[03:55:50.601 --> 03:55:57.546]  It's probably over 25 states since I've been talking that have all been getting on board supporting Texas for what?
[03:55:57.866 --> 03:55:58.747]  Supporting Texas...
[03:55:59.693 --> 03:56:04.636]  For their own state autonomy, their own sovereignty as a state.
[03:56:05.997 --> 03:56:07.738]  And this is what I want people to understand.
[03:56:07.758 --> 03:56:13.882]  If you're a normie out there, maybe you just, you know, you came in on X, or maybe you did find InfoWars.com, banned our video.
[03:56:14.143 --> 03:56:14.463]  Who knows?
[03:56:14.503 --> 03:56:15.724]  Maybe someone shared a link with you.
[03:56:15.964 --> 03:56:17.084]  Like, really think about this.
[03:56:17.124 --> 03:56:20.086]  To all your normie friends out there, maybe clip this and send it to them.
[03:56:21.707 --> 03:56:28.492]  Like, just because you don't live in Texas, or just because you don't live in Arizona, or California, New Mexico, you name it,
[03:56:29.082 --> 03:56:33.285]  Doesn't mean you're not a border state, or even the northern border states in the United States of America.
[03:56:34.586 --> 03:56:36.147]  We are all border states.
[03:56:36.267 --> 03:56:38.268]  That's how America really has to start thinking.
[03:56:39.569 --> 03:56:42.270]  I mean, look how much this is really affecting every single one of us.
[03:56:43.551 --> 03:56:44.932]  These people are being sent everywhere.
[03:56:45.072 --> 03:56:50.836]  To Boston, they're being sent to the inner cities, to the inner states of the United States of America, spreading fentanyl.
[03:56:51.196 --> 03:56:52.297]  They're murdering Americans.
[03:56:52.337 --> 03:56:54.938]  They're raping autistic girls and then murdering them.
[03:56:55.379 --> 03:56:55.659]  They're raping
[03:56:56.941 --> 03:56:59.482]  Raping the mentally disabled and the physically disabled?
[03:57:01.484 --> 03:57:02.664]  How bad does this really have to get?
[03:57:02.684 --> 03:57:03.545]  I think that's the question.
[03:57:04.405 --> 03:57:05.546]  Shouldn't this just be prevented?
[03:57:05.666 --> 03:57:06.786]  Shouldn't this just be stopped?
[03:57:07.827 --> 03:57:10.548]  Shouldn't we just cut the root of the problem?
[03:57:11.249 --> 03:57:14.230]  Shouldn't we just cut the head of the dragon and just stop it immediately?
[03:57:14.250 --> 03:57:18.833]  Like, does it really have to get that bad to where your family gets hit?
[03:57:18.873 --> 03:57:19.433]  Because it will!
[03:57:21.772 --> 03:57:23.093]  There's no running away from this.
[03:57:23.614 --> 03:57:26.356]  Just ask the blacks in Chicago that are all pissed off.
[03:57:26.556 --> 03:57:31.700]  If there's anyone that knows the reality of replacement migration, I'll tell you who knows.
[03:57:31.900 --> 03:57:34.142]  Just go have a conversation with the blacks in Chicago.
[03:57:34.422 --> 03:57:35.743]  They know damn well this is real.
[03:57:36.063 --> 03:57:36.684]  All right, guys.
[03:57:36.984 --> 03:57:39.506]  We got Owen Schroyer, and the War Room is coming up next.

[03:58:32.996 --> 03:58:39.621]  Several studies have shown it helps to reduce cortisol, increase serotonin, and boost vitality.
