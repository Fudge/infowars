[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.480]  [outro]
[00:00:13.653 --> 00:00:15.794]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:00:17.756 --> 00:00:24.756]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.756 --> 00:00:46.876]   The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must
[00:00:46.876 --> 00:00:48.635]  Be followed.
[00:00:48.527 --> 00:00:56.175]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[00:00:56.435 --> 00:00:58.537]  As president, I will make it clear.
[00:00:59.398 --> 00:01:04.140]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:10.023]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[00:01:10.143 --> 00:01:13.225]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[00:01:13.525 --> 00:01:16.486]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[00:01:16.546 --> 00:01:19.107]  We came, we saw, he died.
[00:01:21.505 --> 00:01:23.548]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:27.375]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the President, we will attack Iran.
[00:01:27.575 --> 00:01:35.468]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[00:01:37.383 --> 00:01:37.843]  The U.S.
[00:01:37.883 --> 00:01:41.485]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[00:01:41.846 --> 00:01:49.470]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.171]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[00:01:52.272 --> 00:01:55.433]  Of course not, because she's... Look, there's a really loud noise.
[00:01:55.914 --> 00:02:00.916]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[00:02:00.957 --> 00:02:03.158]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:11.459]  When the President gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:38.459]  [Music]
[00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:51.459]  [Music]
[00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.459]   From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:02:58.381 --> 00:03:00.843]  And we are the front lines of the Information War.
[00:03:00.943 --> 00:03:02.484]  It's Saturday, March 23rd, 2024.
[00:03:02.744 --> 00:03:08.169]  I am your embattled host, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:03:09.403 --> 00:03:11.924]  Broadcasting worldwide!
[00:03:14.224 --> 00:03:16.925]  We have an incredible raft of guests on today.
[00:03:16.965 --> 00:03:23.307]  The top broadcaster in Russia, Vladimir Soyev, will be joining us coming up in the second hour.
[00:03:23.907 --> 00:03:28.829]  Scott Bennett, former Army intel officer, who just spent months on the front lines in the war.
[00:03:30.362 --> 00:03:39.368]  In Ukraine, back from Russia and Ukraine, joining us, Syrian girl who is in Moscow, always giving great analysis, will be joining us as well.
[00:03:39.388 --> 00:03:53.116]  And then Michael Yon, the undisputed top military news correspondent in the last 30 years, who has been warning of the Islamist sleeper cells working for the globalists, planning to attack America.
[00:03:54.397 --> 00:03:57.359]  It is all coming up in the next two hours.
[00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:06.998]   You definitely Want to be part of the information war and part of promoting the truth and you want to take this link, this feed at RealAlexJones you're watching right now and repost it.
[00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.622]  Hit your email list, your text message list, call your friends, your family, your neighbors, tell perfect strangers.
[00:04:12.662 --> 00:04:18.847]  Tune in now to RealAlexJones on X or at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:04:19.728 --> 00:04:20.148]  Okay.
[00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.131]  I am an expert on this topic.
[00:04:23.331 --> 00:04:23.651]  Okay.
[00:04:24.452 --> 00:04:26.794]  I've been on there 30 years in April.
[00:04:29.528 --> 00:04:33.671]  And I had family that worked in secret black operations around the world.
[00:04:35.893 --> 00:04:41.057]  In Latin America, in East Germany, West Germany, you name it.
[00:04:41.097 --> 00:04:43.279]  So I've known about this my whole life.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.840]  I understand the players.
[00:04:45.381 --> 00:04:46.722]  We have top experts coming on.
[00:04:47.142 --> 00:04:51.486]  I can conclusively tell you the facts of what's going on and why this is such a big deal.
[00:04:53.107 --> 00:04:54.148]  And what are we talking about?
[00:04:55.026 --> 00:05:09.409]  We're talking about what happened yesterday while I was live on air with a Friday show, an attack on a major theater that holds over 6,000 people as part of a larger shopping mall in the middle of Moscow.
[00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.590]  I said it'd be over 100 dead.
[00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.071]  It's now 133 dead and climbing.
[00:05:14.851 --> 00:05:26.774]   Dozens, at least 15, supposed ISIS terrorists, who I saw in what looked like Ukrainian uniforms, was Ukrainian gear, We can roll some of the B-roll of the attack for you.
[00:05:28.655 --> 00:05:33.960]  Went in there and began murdering men, women, and children, and tried to burn the entire building down.
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:34.961]  They burned a lot of it down.
[00:05:36.042 --> 00:05:43.729]  Now, immediately, ISIS came out and took responsibility, and is sentenced to prove they did it.
[00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:57.545]   These people are questioning and saying it's Ukraine, including Putin, They've since posted photos and video of them carrying out the attack just to prove it was them.
[00:05:57.945 --> 00:06:02.628]  Well, the globalists think we are the stupidest people in the world.
[00:06:03.108 --> 00:06:08.812]  ISIS was created by Obama and by European and British intelligence with Israel.
[00:06:11.034 --> 00:06:26.334]   And I am going to show you The Jerusalem Post and AP and Reuters saying ISIS is good and that ISIS is our ally.
[00:06:27.655 --> 00:06:41.770]  Now, I began to make the point yesterday when ISIS took credit that ISIS is a cutout of Western intelligence to destabilize the world, attack Western countries so they get giant defense budgets domestically to take our rights, and to be able to invade countries.
[00:06:42.691 --> 00:06:57.635]  The United States openly, under Obama, funded hundreds of thousands of ISIS fighters to start the Arab Spring and the invasion and attempt to topple the leadership in Damascus, Syria.
[00:06:58.816 --> 00:07:28.326]   So when I see the extreme ignorance When I posted these comments and posted statements about this on X yesterday and today, getting tens of millions of readers and viewers, that there were brigades of either useful idiots or liars in the feed saying, ISIS is an Islamic organization, has nothing to do with US, British, European, NATO, Israeli intelligence.
[00:07:29.755 --> 00:07:32.016]  So I'm going to show you Obama saying that the U.S.
[00:07:32.056 --> 00:07:35.098]  government funded ISIS, or he called it ISIL, same group.
[00:07:35.918 --> 00:07:42.061]  I'm going to show you Jerusalem Post and other headlines saying Israel's working with ISIS.
[00:07:43.542 --> 00:07:46.003]  They think you don't have a memory, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:47.264 --> 00:07:49.025]  Osama bin Laden was CIA.
[00:07:51.286 --> 00:07:56.429]  So there is a historical fact here that people don't remember.
[00:07:57.771 --> 00:08:02.055]  I have made more than six films on 9-11 and Islamic terror.
[00:08:03.436 --> 00:08:04.577]  I have written books on it.
[00:08:04.797 --> 00:08:10.823]  I have interviewed hundreds of top guests, including former section chiefs of the CIA.
[00:08:12.725 --> 00:08:33.176]   This is in the mainline historical literature, but it is not something that is normally on the nightly news, though I have AP Reuters And Jerusalem Post saying, Israel helped fund ISIS with Obama, Israel created Hamas, and I'm not anti-Israel, like I'm not anti-USA, but we have criminals running our governments.
[00:08:33.296 --> 00:08:34.597]  I am against what they're doing.
[00:08:35.718 --> 00:08:47.526]  So, this is like saying George Washington was the first president of the United States, and people are arguing because they don't know history, and say it's Abraham Lincoln, who came almost 100 years later.
[00:08:49.164 --> 00:08:57.806]  So this is a fact, ladies and gentlemen, and in fact, I posted on X a Syrian girl two-minute video that I forgot to send the crew.
[00:08:57.826 --> 00:09:05.847]  You guys download that right now, because I want to play that first before we go to her, and Ossie Cossack, who's a great reporter, lives in Australia but has Russian roots.
[00:09:06.527 --> 00:09:08.267]  He's now been able to join us as well.
[00:09:08.547 --> 00:09:14.908]  And then Scott Bennett, Vladimir Solyov, and so much more today.
[00:09:14.948 --> 00:09:16.809]  This is going to be an absolute jam-packed transmission.
[00:09:18.622 --> 00:09:22.946]  I'll be walking through all of this when we have the guest on.
[00:09:22.966 --> 00:09:25.808]  But let's get a first snapshot look at what I just told you I have.
[00:09:25.828 --> 00:09:29.752]  Because when I tell you I've got something, I'm going to show it to you unlike corporate media.
[00:09:30.452 --> 00:09:32.734]  Corporate media will tell you that I'm a Nazi.
[00:09:32.754 --> 00:09:33.655]  They never show a clip of it.
[00:09:33.995 --> 00:09:35.196]  Or they'll say I'm an actor.
[00:09:35.216 --> 00:09:35.977]  Never show a clip of it.
[00:09:36.177 --> 00:09:36.777]  It's all lies.
[00:09:38.219 --> 00:09:39.099]  Overhead shot please.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.181]  Here's just some of the breaking news.
[00:09:41.521 --> 00:09:44.044]  Moscow concert hall attack death toll rises to 133.
[00:09:45.888 --> 00:10:00.522]  Russia arrests 11 Moscow massacre suspects as they reveal names and pictures of those they believe behind the ISIS concert hall slaughter and debt toll that rose to 115, now it's 133, and pictures reveal bloody aftermath.
[00:10:01.063 --> 00:10:10.112]  Putin says Moscow concert hall gunman, gunman who killed 133, tried to flee to Ukraine despite ISIS claiming the attack.
[00:10:11.448 --> 00:10:15.169]  Well, I mean, ISIS has been fighting in Ukraine on the side of Ukraine.
[00:10:15.189 --> 00:10:17.050]  I'll show you mainstream articles in a moment.
[00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:19.150]  Here's another one.
[00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:22.832]  Putin claims Kiev tried, tied to Moscow terror attack.
[00:10:22.932 --> 00:10:24.932]  Ukraine official denies connection.
[00:10:25.232 --> 00:10:42.707]   And then goes on to say Putin, who just won re-election by 87% and has won the war in Ukraine, That he would do this, despite the fact that the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, all put out statements last week, through Fareed Zakaria, saying, we're going to start hitting the Russians inside their country.
[00:10:43.988 --> 00:10:46.449]  And we've seen the drone attacks and the mass shootings.
[00:10:46.649 --> 00:10:51.651]  They've already sent Ukrainians hundreds of times across into Russia, massacring people in towns.
[00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:55.833]  Now they're just doing it in the middle of Moscow.
[00:10:55.913 --> 00:10:58.874]  So the idea that, oh, they'd never do this, is preposterous.
[00:10:59.847 --> 00:11:00.487]  Of course, we have the U.S.
[00:11:00.527 --> 00:11:05.749]  Embassy warning Americans to avoid Moscow concert weeks before the attacks and issuing new warnings today.
[00:11:06.529 --> 00:11:07.749]  That's called covering your tracks.
[00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:12.430]  Russian troops hack off Moscow attacker's ear and feed it to him.
[00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:13.671]  Yeah, they posted the video.
[00:11:13.711 --> 00:11:14.071]  They did it.
[00:11:16.431 --> 00:11:19.232]  Islamic State releases photo of alleged attackers in Russia shooting.
[00:11:19.612 --> 00:11:21.813]  They want the credit to get the heat off their bosses at NATO.
[00:11:23.712 --> 00:11:26.593]  With the world's attention on Gaza, ISIS is making a global comeback.
[00:11:26.653 --> 00:11:29.454]  Yeah, so the West has an excuse to stay in the Middle East.
[00:11:30.054 --> 00:11:37.997]  And here is the new State Department warning today, telling Americans to stay out of populated, popular areas in Moscow.
[00:11:38.057 --> 00:11:44.119]  We'll be going over all of it, but because I mentioned it, let's just show you a small smattering of this.
[00:11:44.139 --> 00:11:45.319]  We'll get to more as we go along.
[00:11:45.779 --> 00:11:47.460]  You can go to the Jerusalem Post website.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.120]  You may have heard of it.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.181]  This is Jerusalem Post, March 13th, 2015.
[00:11:54.286 --> 00:11:58.967]  Report, Israel treating Al-Qaeda fighters wounded in Syrian civil war.
[00:12:02.968 --> 00:12:04.908]  And we've got more.
[00:12:05.828 --> 00:12:10.169]  And I have a clip of Obama calling it ISIL, but it's the same group, ISIS.
[00:12:11.029 --> 00:12:13.870]  Let's go ahead and play clip 11 first.
[00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:18.771]  Here is Obama, who started the attack on Syria over a decade ago.
[00:12:19.431 --> 00:12:23.532]  And here he is talking about ISIS slash Al-Qaeda, ISIL, here it is.
[00:12:24.758 --> 00:12:32.842]  So with the additional steps I ordered last month, we're speeding up training of ISIL forces, including volunteers from Sunni tribes in Anbar province.
[00:12:33.042 --> 00:12:39.426]  Month we're speeding up training of ISIL forces, including volunteers from Sunni tribes in Anbar province.
[00:12:40.867 --> 00:12:41.167]  Okay.
[00:12:41.247 --> 00:12:43.528]  And then we have John Kirby, his warning.
[00:12:43.568 --> 00:12:44.869]  We have a statement by Putin.
[00:12:44.909 --> 00:12:45.869]  I'll get to here in a moment.
[00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:48.751]  Putin does not have the motive in this.
[00:12:48.771 --> 00:12:52.473]  I certainly don't lionize or say Vladimir Putin's an angel.
[00:12:53.902 --> 00:13:08.230]  But look at this, and it's now confirmed, breaking one of the terrorists, Rustam Aschev, is a Ukrainian citizen and fought in the armed forces of Ukraine in 2022.
[00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:11.591]  And here it is, right here.
[00:13:11.651 --> 00:13:15.113]  We've got him being interrogated and admitting to all of it.
[00:13:16.704 --> 00:13:17.505]  That's where we are.
[00:13:17.525 --> 00:13:25.550]  I had Jack Posobiec, Naval Intelligence, incredible connections inside the defense system and people in our own government that don't want World War III.
[00:13:26.171 --> 00:13:33.236]  He's been on probably five times the last two months saying imminent attacks on things like sports stadiums and theaters.
[00:13:33.736 --> 00:13:35.717]  That's exactly what the State Department two weeks ago warned us.
[00:13:36.578 --> 00:13:37.799]  So they can say, oh, we warned you.
[00:13:37.879 --> 00:13:40.541]  They didn't give the Russians the specific intel.
[00:13:42.438 --> 00:13:46.660]  Like the Russians did on the CIA ISIS cutouts that did the Boston bombing.
[00:13:47.221 --> 00:13:48.341]  So again, we're patches as well.
[00:13:49.762 --> 00:13:58.106]  So when the globalists want to take rights or divert people or invade a country, they activate ISIS, which is just Al Qaeda under a new name.
[00:13:58.146 --> 00:14:04.169]  Then they go to these countries in Central Asia where they have very, very low nutrition.
[00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.450]  There's a lot of inbreeding.
[00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:06.571]  They have very low IQs.
[00:14:06.591 --> 00:14:07.571]  You see the interrogations.
[00:14:07.591 --> 00:14:08.732]  These guys are really stupid.
[00:14:09.534 --> 00:14:12.916]  They go to Ukraine, their mama gets, you know, paid a half million dollars.
[00:14:13.516 --> 00:14:15.438]  They go on this mission trying to flee back to Ukraine.
[00:14:15.478 --> 00:14:18.660]  That's where they caught, now, more than 10 of them.
[00:14:20.541 --> 00:14:21.861]  And you see the footage, it's real.
[00:14:21.901 --> 00:14:22.702]  You can't fake that.
[00:14:23.282 --> 00:14:29.366]  You'd get a hundred Oscars if you could of the Russian special operations people catching them.
[00:14:30.287 --> 00:14:30.467]  So...
[00:14:31.601 --> 00:14:42.066]  The globalist Fareed Zakaria just on last Saturday, and I aired it Monday and said they're getting ready for terror attacks inside Russia, said it's not about sanctions, it's about hurting the Russians inside their country with attacks.
[00:14:43.606 --> 00:14:46.287]  And that's what Ukraine has said they'll do.
[00:14:46.367 --> 00:14:48.648]  They've blown up the bridge repeatedly.
[00:14:48.688 --> 00:14:54.191]  They blew up the Nord Stream pipeline and said Putin did it, and now it's been leaked to Cyrus, of course, that it wasn't.
[00:14:55.458 --> 00:14:56.599]  Of course it was done by the West.
[00:14:57.601 --> 00:15:02.146]  And who's dissolving our borders after destroying the Middle East and bringing all the Islamist, jihadi, military-age men here?
[00:15:03.288 --> 00:15:13.348]   Those are the sleeper cells, if and when Trump wins, that the left's already said are going to uprise with Black Lives Matter and others And literally bring the country into an inferno.
[00:15:13.649 --> 00:15:15.310]  And what did the federal judge rule on Monday?
[00:15:15.731 --> 00:15:19.595]  Illegal aliens can have guns, but the same judge said citizens can't.
[00:15:20.015 --> 00:15:27.843]  And the Attorney General, I have the articles right here, announced they're going to go after American gun owners without warrants and take your guns, but the illegal aliens can have them.
[00:15:28.044 --> 00:15:30.106]  So they're bringing in the illegal aliens, giving them the guns.
[00:15:30.747 --> 00:15:35.344]   This is Red Dawn, folks, but it's directed by the criminals that have hijacked Our government.
[00:15:35.865 --> 00:15:38.567]  Now we're going to go to Syrian girl in Moscow.
[00:15:38.587 --> 00:15:40.088]  She's got incredible B-roll she sent us.
[00:15:40.388 --> 00:15:44.370]  She's actually gotten access into the theater because of her press credentials or the surrounding areas.
[00:15:44.711 --> 00:15:50.695]  Aussie Cossacks up very, very early in Australia joining us.
[00:15:51.115 --> 00:15:52.016]  And then so much more.
[00:15:52.056 --> 00:15:56.499]  But I wanted to give this preface here that the globalists are losing their war in Russia.
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.320]  And they said they would.
[00:15:59.541 --> 00:16:00.861]  And they've been doing cross-border attacks.
[00:16:01.202 --> 00:16:04.144]  And so now they hope you don't know ISIS is a creation of the West.
[00:16:05.054 --> 00:16:10.083]  So here is a short clip of Vladimir Putin making these points today.
[00:16:11.813 --> 00:16:13.553]  They were found and apprehended.
[00:16:13.573 --> 00:16:15.734]  They tried to escape.
[00:16:15.934 --> 00:16:20.555]  They were moving towards the border with Ukraine.
[00:16:20.835 --> 00:16:31.738]  And we have data that suggests that they were about to be moved towards the territory of Ukraine by those in Ukraine.
[00:16:32.258 --> 00:16:51.765]   Our military services, our emergency services, everyone is, our investigators are working on Finding out the orchestrators of this terrorist attack, those who gave them transportation, who gave them weapons, etc.
[00:16:52.165 --> 00:16:58.548]  The investigative authorities will do everything to identify all details of this crime.
[00:16:58.949 --> 00:17:10.939]   But it's already evident that we face not just a cynically organized terrorist attack, but a massive Mass killing of civilians.
[00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:21.072]   These perpetrators, these criminals went specifically to kill To kill people, point-blank.
[00:17:21.292 --> 00:17:34.600]  Our people, our children, just like the Nazis that once killed our people during the war, they do the same.
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:47.492]   All the orchestrators, all those who are responsible for this crime will inevitably Be found responsible, they will pay.
[00:17:47.512 --> 00:17:54.060]  We will identify everyone who stands behind these terrorists and they will pay.
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:55.962]  This is a strike against Russia.
[00:17:58.925 --> 00:18:14.192]  We know what terrorist threat means and we expect that other nations that share our pain will cooperate with us and we will stand united against this common enemy, international terrorism.
[00:18:15.032 --> 00:18:18.633]  Vladimir Solyakov is joining us coming up in the next hour.
[00:18:18.452 --> 00:18:28.853]   its ugly head. These terrorists have no nationality and there's only one future for them. Retribution
[00:18:28.853 --> 00:18:31.853]  and oblivion.
[00:18:31.853 --> 00:18:36.853]  Vladimir Solyakov is joining us coming up in the next hour.
[00:18:36.853 --> 00:18:40.962]   We're going to have all three of these guys together here in just a moment. Syrian
[00:18:40.962 --> 00:18:42.212]  girl, Ossie Kossak.
[00:18:42.232 --> 00:18:50.232]   Cyrinderl's in Moscow. Scott Bennett, former Army intel, has spent months in country covering it live.
[00:18:50.232 --> 00:18:56.232]   He's coming up and Michael Yawn today. But Cyrinderl did a great job in two minutes today on her ex-account
[00:18:56.232 --> 00:19:02.232]   breaking down ISIS. And it's not connections. It was born out of Western intelligence.
[00:19:02.232 --> 00:19:06.232]   Going back to Jimmy Carter and then Reagan, finally Mujahideen, they needed new names.
[00:19:06.232 --> 00:19:12.942]   They renamed Al-Qaeda, ISIS or ISIL. You just saw Obama admit to it. Here's a few minutes of her and then we'll go
[00:19:12.942 --> 00:19:13.232]  to her live.
[00:19:14.232 --> 00:19:13.792]  Hi everyone, it's Cyrinderl and I'm in Moscow right now.
[00:19:13.792 --> 00:19:21.232]  Just after the terrorist attack.
[00:19:21.304 --> 00:19:24.965]  I can tell you that most people are doubting that this is ISIS.
[00:19:25.565 --> 00:19:31.888]  Most people, including the government, likely are suspecting that this is Ukrainian terrorists.
[00:19:32.048 --> 00:19:35.910]  This is not the first time that a terrorist attack happened in Moscow.
[00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:41.828]   Of course, there was the assassination of Darya Dugina with a car bomb right here.
[00:19:41.828 --> 00:19:46.110]  There were multiple other attempts at attacks.
[00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:51.569]   There is heightened security here, although I think it became a little bit too relaxed
[00:19:51.569 --> 00:19:53.590]  over time.
[00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:57.149]  And now that's not going to be the case anymore.
[00:19:57.149 --> 00:20:03.350]   But the fact that ISIS supposedly just posted on this website that they were responsible
[00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:05.669]  does not equal that they were responsible.
[00:20:06.128 --> 00:20:11.813]  And we all know, like, why suddenly, at this convenient time, there's a resurgence of ISIS.
[00:20:12.334 --> 00:20:15.496]  You know, how many years has it been since there was an ISIS?
[00:20:15.997 --> 00:20:22.503]  And why is it that while there's a genocide going on in Palestine, ISIS never attacks Israel?
[00:20:22.543 --> 00:20:31.350]   And the one time that a wayward missile went in their direction, The Israeli Defense Minister said that ISIS apologized to them.
[00:20:31.891 --> 00:20:39.176]  Why is it that this ISIS creature is always attacking the countries that the US is fighting at that time?
[00:20:39.236 --> 00:20:45.160]  For example, you know, during the Syrian war, we were fought by ISIS to the point of devastation.
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:49.863]  And at the same time as ISIS was bombing us, the US was bombing us.
[00:20:50.202 --> 00:20:52.601]  is not strangely convenient.
[00:20:52.601 --> 00:20:57.282]   And the fact that during the Iraq war where ISIS was born out of Al-Qaeda,
[00:20:57.282 --> 00:21:02.403]   isn't it strange that where the US is fighting, ISIS just happens to be fighting
[00:21:02.403 --> 00:21:03.843]  the people that they're fighting.
[00:21:03.843 --> 00:21:06.522]  I mean, like, doesn't that strike anyone as odd?
[00:21:06.522 --> 00:21:13.322]   Doesn't it strike anyone as odd that just after Russia vetoed a pro-Israel UN resolution,
[00:21:13.322 --> 00:21:23.163]   like within hours or within minutes, this attack happens, the fact that Russia only a few weeks ago
[00:21:23.163 --> 00:21:29.802]   had all of the Palestinian leadership here, including Hamas, doesn't it strike anyone as odd
[00:21:29.802 --> 00:21:36.942]   that ISIS would choose to target the country that brought them in and try to support them?
[00:21:36.942 --> 00:21:49.733]   And you know I Isn't it the case that Israel is destroying mosque after mosque and threatening to take the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the most holy mosque in Islam, and turn it into a synagogue and build the third temple?
[00:21:50.453 --> 00:21:59.116]  Isn't it odd that at that time when this is happening, ISIS is still just attacking the enemies of the United States?
[00:22:00.416 --> 00:22:00.836]  Come on!
[00:22:00.856 --> 00:22:06.099]  I mean, how much more obvious can you get that ISIS is the CIA and the Mossad?
[00:22:06.759 --> 00:22:19.866]  Or, the actors that did this, in fact, were not ISIS, but in fact, were probably traitors, Ukrainians working for the Americans.
[00:22:22.333 --> 00:22:26.655]  It's not even, like, the mask has completely fallen off with this attack, seriously.
[00:22:27.855 --> 00:22:31.697]  It makes absolutely no sense that ISIS would return at this opportune moment.
[00:22:32.737 --> 00:22:44.842]  And it's also super suspicious that the United States knew anything so specific about the terrorist attack weeks in advance that they knew it was going to be a concert.
[00:22:45.402 --> 00:22:47.523]  Was that a warning or was that a threat?
[00:22:48.564 --> 00:22:52.076]   I'm gonna Report more as the story develops.
[00:22:52.416 --> 00:22:53.217]  Thank you very much.
[00:22:53.357 --> 00:22:55.299]  Please follow me as Partisan Girl.
[00:22:56.921 --> 00:23:02.145]  All right, joining us and riding shotgun with us for the rest of the hour is Syrian Girl from Moscow.
[00:23:02.205 --> 00:23:06.469]  She lives outside Russia, but she's there to cover all this as a journalist.
[00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:12.375]  And also Ossi Kossak, who has Russian roots, but is in Australia, also a great reporter and journalist.
[00:23:12.395 --> 00:23:14.237]  We know him well, battling the COVID lockdowns.
[00:23:14.797 --> 00:23:20.962]  And then Scott Bennett, former Army intel, just spent months in the frontline areas in Ukraine joining us.
[00:23:21.103 --> 00:23:25.406]  And then Vladimir Soloviev coming up, the biggest broadcaster in Russia.
[00:23:25.666 --> 00:23:27.068]  He's doing a show live right now.
[00:23:27.108 --> 00:23:30.390]  He's off in about 36 minutes from now.
[00:23:31.131 --> 00:23:33.633]  So, going first to Syrian Girl.
[00:23:34.334 --> 00:23:39.238]  Since you posted that, what, 10 hours ago, you were able to get access as a journalist to areas other people weren't.
[00:23:39.258 --> 00:23:41.360]  You've been able to go and survey what's happening.
[00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.701]  What's the intel you've got for us?
[00:23:45.661 --> 00:23:54.130]  Well, I've sent some B-roll to your producer on the scene, you know, people are putting flowers down at the mall with Saqqakhan.
[00:23:54.770 --> 00:24:00.696]  There's devastation burnt, you know, you can see the building, his roof has collapsed.
[00:24:01.215 --> 00:24:02.116]  and has been burned.
[00:24:02.316 --> 00:24:05.039]  Obviously, they used a lot of munitions to be able to do that.
[00:24:05.079 --> 00:24:06.240]  They were very well prepared.
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:17.772]  And I wanted to say, you know, one thing I wanted to add as well is, you know, the CIA and the Mossad have been very closely linked since Henry Kissinger.
[00:24:18.452 --> 00:24:28.897]  And the Likud party was on Russia Today, like Russian television, threatening Russia for their stance on Gaza and saying that they're going to pay for it.
[00:24:29.597 --> 00:24:32.178]  Maybe it's not a coincidence that a concert was targeted.
[00:24:32.818 --> 00:24:43.783]  By the way, I posted that on my ex, I posted that on ex last night, it got like 3 million views, where a member of the Knesset literally says, we're going to attack you with these attacks, blaming Russia for it.
[00:24:44.883 --> 00:24:46.264]  And the RT host is just blown away.
[00:24:48.587 --> 00:25:08.680]  Well, also Colonel Douglas MacGregor said it's the CIA, but the thing that really interests me is the fact that, you know, you and I, Alex, especially you, you were there at the very beginning, but I think 10 years ago, 12 years ago, the first interview we did together was because I made a video that said Al-Qaeda is Al-CIA.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:16.510]  And the fact is now, it's so open and so blatant that even the Russian government's like, no, this is not ISIS.
[00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:18.152]  This is Ukraine.
[00:25:18.172 --> 00:25:25.263]  It's a big deal to have Putin come out and say they're using ISIS as a NATO cutout and they tried to flee, they caught them running into Ukraine.
[00:25:27.174 --> 00:25:40.938]  What was a conspiracy theory that we were talking about a decade or more ago is now just back and it's just amazing to see because it didn't even make any sense to use ISIS as this cutout at this time.
[00:25:43.659 --> 00:25:48.860]  Victoria Nuland also threatened nasty surprises towards Russia recently.
[00:25:50.521 --> 00:25:55.622]  It's just a mask-off moment, that's what I would call it.
[00:25:56.678 --> 00:25:58.239]  I agree, and it shows total desperateness.
[00:25:58.259 --> 00:26:04.485]  Did you see the clip of Fareed Zarqari, who was the mouth of the Globalist, saying we need to hit Russia internally and hurt them just last week?
[00:26:06.227 --> 00:26:07.167]  Well, absolutely.
[00:26:07.227 --> 00:26:11.191]  And I wonder, I didn't see any ISIS flags.
[00:26:11.251 --> 00:26:13.413]  I watched the footage of the terrorist attack.
[00:26:13.773 --> 00:26:15.054]  I didn't see any ISIS flags.
[00:26:15.134 --> 00:26:16.716]  I didn't see any... Yeah, what did you see?
[00:26:16.736 --> 00:26:18.758]  It sure looked like Ukrainian uniforms to me.
[00:26:20.214 --> 00:26:26.537]  A hundred percent and the fact that they were fleeing towards Ukraine, you know, the fact is like no one's buying it here.
[00:26:26.597 --> 00:26:29.638]  No one's buying suddenly ISIS comes out of nowhere.
[00:26:29.958 --> 00:26:36.240]  You know, how many must have been devastated in Palestine at this time?
[00:26:36.561 --> 00:26:37.581]  And what has Russia done?
[00:26:38.021 --> 00:26:55.107]   I was here when Russia brought in all of the Palestinian factions, Fatah and including Hamas, And so, of all the people ISIS is going to target, it's going to target... Sorry about that.
[00:26:55.507 --> 00:26:56.208]  My phone fell over.
[00:26:56.228 --> 00:26:58.628]  So it's going to target Russia?
[00:26:59.068 --> 00:26:59.649]  That's right.
[00:27:00.129 --> 00:27:02.089]  ISIS never attacks the West.
[00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:03.710]  It never attacks Israel.
[00:27:05.316 --> 00:27:05.977]  Absolutely!
[00:27:06.117 --> 00:27:29.558]  And, you know, the Israeli Defense Minister said ISIS apologized to them, as I said in that clip, but ISIS really helped Israel in the 1982 Oded Yunan Plan, which was Israel's paper that was written in 1982 to cut Syria up into different regions, including a region east of the Euphrates.
[00:27:30.058 --> 00:27:34.240]  And, you know, there's articles written about this, that ISIS really helped in this regard.
[00:27:34.501 --> 00:27:43.946]  And also the former Defense Minister of Israel said he would prefer ISIS to be victorious in Syria than they would Iran.
[00:27:44.386 --> 00:27:50.970]  Furthermore, Israel was helping Al-Qaeda, ISIS on the Golan Heights border, giving them medical aid.
[00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:53.671]  This is all historically documented.
[00:27:53.731 --> 00:28:07.295]   You have on the WikiLeaks cables You know, in the Hillary Clinton emails, they wrote, by the way, FYI or P.S., Al-Qaeda is on our side in Syria, if anyone remembers that.
[00:28:07.415 --> 00:28:12.721]  Hillary Clinton, on record, saying these are the same people that we supported.
[00:28:14.242 --> 00:28:16.943]  You know, they've done it before, why wouldn't they do it again?
[00:28:16.963 --> 00:28:18.684]  This is a tried and true strategy.
[00:28:18.704 --> 00:28:23.326]  And the thing that I worry about is that they're going to use this as just the beginning.
[00:28:23.346 --> 00:28:25.467]  Because this is how things started in Syria.
[00:28:25.767 --> 00:28:30.910]  You know, you started with one, like, such devastating terrorist attack, then it becomes an everyday thing.
[00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:36.993]  And that's their way of bringing the war to the heart of Russia, which is going to escalate into World War III.
[00:28:37.393 --> 00:28:39.334]  And everywhere is going to end up like Gaza.
[00:28:39.714 --> 00:28:41.975]  And Jared Kushner is going to sell our real estate.
[00:28:44.107 --> 00:28:44.908]  Very well said.
[00:28:44.928 --> 00:28:46.930]  I mean, let's talk about big picture, though.
[00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:51.835]  I want to go to Ossie Kossak, who's, again, Russian roots, really covers it well.
[00:28:52.055 --> 00:28:57.301]  We know him from coverage of the incredible lockdowns and getting arrested for protesting it and exposing it.
[00:28:58.442 --> 00:29:06.787]   On what you're seeing here and your analysis, but then larger analysis, we have millions of
[00:29:06.787 --> 00:29:12.248]   military age men being brought in that we know are tied to ISIS. They admit that.
[00:29:12.248 --> 00:29:16.367]   Millions of men, hundreds of thousands tied to it, conservatively. And then
[00:29:16.367 --> 00:29:18.898]   they're telling us imminent terror attacks, but they're the ones that have
[00:29:18.898 --> 00:29:22.447]   opened the border. We can show the border in El Paso on Thursday completely
[00:29:22.447 --> 00:29:27.098]   collapses, running over the border patrol. And they're telling us look for
[00:29:27.098 --> 00:29:32.447]   terror attacks and look for civil uprisings in America.
[00:29:31.027 --> 00:29:33.772]  If you think Russia's got a problem, we're gonna have a really big problem.
[00:29:34.133 --> 00:29:42.033]   Because again, the globalists use ISIS, which is really Al-Qaeda, as their destabilization tool.
[00:29:42.033 --> 00:29:48.312]   And we know they're launching Operation Gladio 2.0 that was a Pentagon plan with the EU and NATO
[00:29:48.312 --> 00:29:53.471]   before the EU even existed officially with NATO in the '50s, '60s, '70s, and '80s,
[00:29:53.471 --> 00:29:59.793]   declassified staging mass terror attacks and then blaming the Russians for it.
[00:29:59.793 --> 00:30:04.854]   And now they've just switched to an Islamic threat So when you talk about big picture, what was the goal of this?
[00:30:05.434 --> 00:30:08.555]  It's desperately blown up in their face, just like blowing up the North Street pipeline.
[00:30:09.015 --> 00:30:16.277]  Everything they do is failing, but they keep running the same playbook that worked 40, 50 years ago, 20 years ago.
[00:30:16.597 --> 00:30:17.497]  It doesn't work now.
[00:30:17.517 --> 00:30:21.818]  I want to ask Syrian Girl that question too, but let's go to Aussie Cossack first.
[00:30:22.158 --> 00:30:24.919]  Thanks for being up so early to join us, and what's your view on this?
[00:30:26.738 --> 00:30:28.658]  My pleasure, Alex Serengel.
[00:30:29.258 --> 00:30:34.839]  Look, not to be cynical, of course condolences to the victims and it's a tragedy, but not to be cynical at all.
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.440]  This is an own goal by Russia's enemies.
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:43.761]  This actually, incredibly, will help Russia unite and stabilize after the elections.
[00:30:44.301 --> 00:30:53.103]  Even those people that were perhaps maybe a little bit shy about the conflict, they will definitely be fully supporting Vladimir Putin now, when he got 78% in Russia.
[00:30:55.404 --> 00:30:58.767]  That still means there's a very small amount of the population who didn't vote for him.
[00:30:59.167 --> 00:31:10.596]  But after these scenes, after seeing people in shopping centres and the optics of shopping centres, what's the difference between a Russian family of Russian civilians being killed in Donbass, Donetsk or Belgorod?
[00:31:10.856 --> 00:31:12.017]  Well, the difference is the optics.
[00:31:12.277 --> 00:31:16.460]  When they're killed in a shopping centre, that appeals to the hearts and minds of the Western audience.
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:24.106]  Now, the Western audience all around the world, in fact, led by Western governments, have been giving condolences and have been condemning this terrorist attack.
[00:31:24.605 --> 00:31:36.732]  This is a big problem for Zelensky's regime that one of the terrorists has been caught with a Ukrainian passport and it's now been revealed moments ago that he actually served in the Ukrainian military.
[00:31:36.752 --> 00:31:38.333]  So he's a veteran of the Ukrainian military.
[00:31:38.753 --> 00:31:41.875]  They were on their way back to Ukraine to try to cross the border to escape.
[00:31:42.495 --> 00:31:49.279]  President Putin has blasted the Ukrainians for allowing the terrorists a window, as he put it, to escape.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:58.021]   Now if the whole world has condemned the terrorists, including Germany, France, The United States, everyone has condemned the terrorists.
[00:31:58.061 --> 00:32:04.023]  Now it turns out that the terrorists are backed by Ukraine, in fact trained in the Ukrainian military, and now heading back to Ukraine.
[00:32:04.543 --> 00:32:07.304]  It's very uncomfortable now for Zelensky.
[00:32:07.344 --> 00:32:08.424]  He's going to lose a lot of support.
[00:32:08.484 --> 00:32:18.106]  If he thought he was going to get those billions and those weapons, he was just hanging on by a thread, and I think this is the straw that's going to break the camel's back, and so it should.
[00:32:18.246 --> 00:32:20.027]  Those people did not die in vain.
[00:32:20.447 --> 00:32:23.748]  If we can turn this around, and this will be the end of Zelensky.
[00:32:24.791 --> 00:32:37.482]  Those people's memory who died tragically at the shopping center in Moscow, they will be revered and remembered as a pivotal moment for the whole of Russia.
[00:32:37.782 --> 00:32:40.725]  Putin just announced he wants the death penalty back, the Parliament just said.
[00:32:41.586 --> 00:32:58.225]   And he also, after the video with the Russian soldier cutting off the ear of the terrorist, He announced only hours later that Russian soldiers who are serving in the special military operation will be considered immune from criminal prosecution.
[00:32:58.245 --> 00:32:59.186]  Now that's not a coincidence.
[00:32:59.326 --> 00:33:01.869]  That's literally Vladimir Putin looking after the boys.
[00:33:02.009 --> 00:33:03.731]  Well that's Vladimir Putin taking the gloves off.
[00:33:05.464 --> 00:33:06.365]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:33:06.405 --> 00:33:06.965]  Take the gloves off.
[00:33:06.985 --> 00:33:08.286]  There's no more mucking around.
[00:33:08.346 --> 00:33:09.447]  And this is what Russians wanted.
[00:33:09.808 --> 00:33:10.748]  Putin was always shy.
[00:33:10.788 --> 00:33:11.649]  He was always careful.
[00:33:11.949 --> 00:33:13.611]  He always let the situation develop.
[00:33:13.831 --> 00:33:15.692]  And he was never emotional about things.
[00:33:15.732 --> 00:33:16.573]  He was cold-hearted.
[00:33:16.973 --> 00:33:19.756]  And today you saw he was very angry in his speech.
[00:33:19.836 --> 00:33:24.179]  He was very upset that someone would strike in the heart of Moscow and kill innocent civilians.
[00:33:24.219 --> 00:33:27.062]  And there's a whole front line, 1,500 kilometers of it.
[00:33:27.442 --> 00:33:28.142]  You want to have a go?
[00:33:28.163 --> 00:33:28.683]  You want to fight?
[00:33:29.147 --> 00:33:30.328]  Go and fight on the front line.
[00:33:30.528 --> 00:33:31.649]  It's a long front line.
[00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:33.932]  No, they choose to attack civilians.
[00:33:34.312 --> 00:33:35.133]  It's an un-goal.
[00:33:35.173 --> 00:33:35.713]  Absolutely un-goal.
[00:33:35.733 --> 00:33:36.354]  Let's expand on that.
[00:33:36.374 --> 00:33:41.399]  We put an InfoWars.com article out yesterday saying, Internet explodes, saying Putin false flag.
[00:33:41.979 --> 00:33:42.860]  I just tell the truth.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:43.921]  My job's easy.
[00:33:44.241 --> 00:33:45.602]  There's no motive for the Russians.
[00:33:47.305 --> 00:33:51.766]  Kiev said it's been doing cross-border attacks on small towns, doing this every week.
[00:33:51.806 --> 00:33:53.007]  It just doesn't get a lot of coverage.
[00:33:53.587 --> 00:33:56.487]  They've launched a bunch of drones at Moscow, already killed a bunch of people.
[00:33:56.987 --> 00:33:58.928]  They've already blown up the pipeline, blown up the bridge.
[00:33:58.948 --> 00:34:00.428]  They already said we're going to target civilians.
[00:34:00.828 --> 00:34:03.609]  We got Fareed Zakaria calling for it on CNN last week.
[00:34:04.689 --> 00:34:10.191]  And then you've got ISIS's long history of being a Western cutout, and they have the nerve to turn around and do this, but that's why I'm saying it's so stupid.
[00:34:11.051 --> 00:34:14.552]  And that gives some credence to those who say it's a false flag, but the evidence is it isn't.
[00:34:16.969 --> 00:34:17.329]  Thanks.
[00:34:17.709 --> 00:34:18.870]  That's what Zakaria said.
[00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:21.331]  He said, we've got to attack the Russians in their country.
[00:34:21.791 --> 00:34:23.032]  That will intimidate them.
[00:34:23.312 --> 00:34:31.515]  When we all know, if you could pick any group of people in history, other than like the Vietnamese, that have been constantly invaded, that is going to do the opposite.
[00:34:31.695 --> 00:34:35.197]  Anybody with a basic understanding of history knows you're going to get the default opposite.
[00:34:35.257 --> 00:34:42.080]  But the globalists are officially saying they would do this, and they've been doing it with drones and missiles and cross-border attacks.
[00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:43.360]  This is just in Moscow.
[00:34:45.761 --> 00:34:52.005]  You sit back and you ask yourself, Syrian girl, then I'll go back to Aussie Cossack, why the globalists are doing things so stupid?
[00:34:52.405 --> 00:34:54.206]  I mean, they tried to blame Putin for the pipeline.
[00:34:54.226 --> 00:34:55.087]  Everybody knows they did it.
[00:34:55.267 --> 00:34:56.167]  It's all come out they did it.
[00:34:56.188 --> 00:35:06.694]  I mean, they're just, they keep playing the same, and Jack Posobiec may be able to pop on, he predicted all of this, that they would, because they've shifted to terrorism, thinking that's going to make the Russians give up.
[00:35:08.979 --> 00:35:11.581]  I mean, honestly, I just don't think that they care anymore.
[00:35:11.602 --> 00:35:23.693]  I think this is like a fig leaf for their own population to, you know, sort of muddy the waters and have a little bit of doubt in there as to whether they were the ones responsible for the terrorism.
[00:35:24.213 --> 00:35:37.136]  Of course, they've been doing this in the Middle East for decades, where they've been, you know, devastating the population of Iraq and Syria and Palestine with the guise of, oh, this is just ISIS, this isn't us doing this.
[00:35:37.516 --> 00:35:40.917]  When it was them, all we always knew was them all along, right?
[00:35:41.197 --> 00:35:44.478]  But now it's just like they don't even care to make it make sense.
[00:35:45.858 --> 00:35:51.820]  So, I think it's not even for the Russian population or the Russian government to have a doubt.
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:57.161]  It's for their own populations to maybe still think that we're the good guys.
[00:35:57.742 --> 00:36:04.783]  I agree, that's the key, because now they've got AP Reuters, all of them saying, ISIS is back, they're going to attack everywhere, we've got to invade more countries.
[00:36:05.264 --> 00:36:09.985]  Getting us ready for ISIS to strike America, who they brought in, who they think we're so dumb.
[00:36:10.845 --> 00:36:18.297]  That we won't know it's the deep state, and then when they strike America, when Trump wins, they'll say when Trump doesn't attack countries, he's weak.
[00:36:19.039 --> 00:36:20.020]  That's what I was seeing.
[00:36:20.821 --> 00:36:23.346]  Your take on that, Syrian Girl and then Aussie Cossack.
[00:36:24.755 --> 00:36:34.686]  Well, and one thing I just want to mention about the false flag idea, you know, this was actually something that happened during the Syrian war, you know, the first ISIS attacks in Damascus.
[00:36:35.107 --> 00:36:44.157]   It was the mainstream media that accused Assad of doing false flag ISIS attacks On Damascus.
[00:36:44.177 --> 00:36:49.701]  This was before the mainstream media even admitted that ISIS and Al-Qaeda was in Damascus.
[00:36:49.741 --> 00:36:54.444]  So it's kind of like an intelligence ploy to muddy the waters even more.
[00:36:54.485 --> 00:36:55.906]  Like, oh, Russia did it to themselves.
[00:36:55.966 --> 00:36:57.367]  Russia blew up their own pipelines.
[00:36:58.428 --> 00:36:59.949]  It's all lies, of course.
[00:37:00.249 --> 00:37:04.052]  The thing is that Russia does not really benefit from this because they were winning anyway.
[00:37:04.492 --> 00:37:05.093]  So why?
[00:37:05.153 --> 00:37:16.681]  There's no need to do this to themselves, but the special operation is certainly now, I think they were no longer referring me to that, now they're going to call it a war because it's reached home soil.
[00:37:16.961 --> 00:37:37.974]   And of course that's the objective here, to have the devastation reach Moscow's heartland, to destroy its economy, to spread fear, to have an exodus of the population, cause a brain drain, All of the things that you do in asymmetric warfare... No, no, I totally agree, Siri girl, but... And I want you to continue, I'm going to ask all of you this, we'll go to Scott Bennett.
[00:37:39.194 --> 00:37:44.936]  But the globalists don't care if we know the truth that they did it, because only a select population is informed and does research.
[00:37:45.436 --> 00:37:47.197]  They want to invoke...
[00:37:48.743 --> 00:37:54.731]  Attacks on Russia's heartland to get Putin to escalate because they want to be able to bring NATO in.
[00:37:55.111 --> 00:37:56.794]  So that's clearly the goal here.
[00:37:57.194 --> 00:38:00.719]  So we don't want Putin to escalate the Syrian girl.
[00:38:03.939 --> 00:38:06.161]  Well, we don't want an escalation at all.
[00:38:06.181 --> 00:38:08.923]  If it's an escalation, it's going to end up in World War II.
[00:38:09.203 --> 00:38:10.904]  World War III, I apologize.
[00:38:11.565 --> 00:38:15.067]  But, you know, Nate, this doesn't happen in a vacuum.
[00:38:15.548 --> 00:38:24.954]   I think only a few weeks or days ago, the French President Macron said that they were going to send French troops Into Ukraine.
[00:38:25.354 --> 00:38:29.076]  So obviously NATO was already getting ready to participate.
[00:38:29.636 --> 00:38:33.157]  And maybe they want that escalation in order for that to happen.
[00:38:33.197 --> 00:38:35.218]  But maybe this is a message to Russia.
[00:38:35.338 --> 00:38:37.499]  Absolutely.
[00:38:37.859 --> 00:38:41.921]  And even the fact that they're prepared for a full-scale escalation.
[00:38:42.181 --> 00:38:43.722]  They're prepared for World War 3.
[00:38:44.202 --> 00:38:47.083]  And I think Russia has to be prepared for that also.
[00:38:47.404 --> 00:38:50.525]  Because it's an existential threat to them at this point.
[00:38:50.806 --> 00:38:51.470]  I want to be clear.
[00:38:51.813 --> 00:38:53.766]  All mainline analysts agree.
[00:38:54.892 --> 00:38:56.553]  That we're the closest nuclear war we've ever been.
[00:38:56.833 --> 00:39:03.677]  So, people that have lived under this security for so long, of mutually assured destruction, need to understand this is worse than the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[00:39:04.057 --> 00:39:09.720]  Aussie Cossack, I want to get all of you guys back with us tomorrow on the Sunday show, the weekday show.
[00:39:10.061 --> 00:39:15.243]  This is so central, it shows the insanity of the globalists, to think we don't know who ISIS is, who they work for.
[00:39:16.064 --> 00:39:20.006]  You heard all those questions I asked in like four or five minute closing statements.
[00:39:20.026 --> 00:39:21.527]  We're going to bring Scott Bennett in.
[00:39:21.547 --> 00:39:22.968]  What else do you want to impart to folks?
[00:39:25.526 --> 00:39:31.870]  Well, one thing that the West misunderstands about Russia is that Russia has a chivalry and military tradition.
[00:39:32.431 --> 00:39:36.774]  And it's for that reason that Russia has not unleashed on Ukraine from day one.
[00:39:36.974 --> 00:39:39.596]  Because Russia seeks to minimize Ukrainian casualties.
[00:39:40.016 --> 00:39:52.405]  But now that it's been proven, and Vladimir Putin's confirmed, and these terrorists that committed this attack at the shopping center yesterday, it's confirmed that they are Ukrainian citizens trained in the Ukrainian military.
[00:39:53.647 --> 00:39:56.189]  Let's refer to what Medvedev said 24 hours ago.
[00:39:56.289 --> 00:40:07.574]  He said, we will find and ruthlessly eliminate as terrorists officials of the Ukraine that committed such atrocities if this terrorist attack is somehow connected to Ukraine, death for death.
[00:40:08.335 --> 00:40:09.135]  Now it's been confirmed.
[00:40:09.155 --> 00:40:11.296]  That was 24 hours ago, he promised, death for death.
[00:40:11.616 --> 00:40:15.258]  Now, Putin himself has confirmed that they had a window to Ukraine.
[00:40:15.703 --> 00:40:19.526]  Now we've got Ukrainian passport holders as terrorists serving in the Ukrainian military.
[00:40:20.126 --> 00:40:22.288]  Russia has been holding back because it has chivalry.
[00:40:22.488 --> 00:40:24.630]  It doesn't want to see Ukrainian civilians die.
[00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:29.033]  What they've done here, cold blooded killing of Russian civilians in a mall.
[00:40:30.134 --> 00:40:34.810]   They are inviting the wrath of the Russian military, Russia as a superpower,
[00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:37.290]  but still Russia doesn't want to do it.
[00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:41.370]   Russia is losing men, Russia is fighting valiantly, but with chivalry.
[00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:46.070]   It's like with one hand tied behind its back, the West looks and thinks, "Oh look, you couldn't take
[00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:47.450]  Ukraine in three days."
[00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:51.090]  Russia has had since 1941 the technology to flatten cities.
[00:40:51.322 --> 00:40:53.766]  To flatten cities all the way up until 1945.
[00:40:54.246 --> 00:40:58.713]  It hasn't used that because Russia is putting itself on the line to save Ukraine.
[00:40:58.913 --> 00:41:00.655]  The only country in the whole world!
[00:41:00.775 --> 00:41:01.837]  The only country!
[00:41:02.594 --> 00:41:04.674]  That cares about Ukraine is actually Russia.
[00:41:05.015 --> 00:41:11.276]  That's the country that's going to be there to rebuild Ukraine, to pick up from when these Nazis are liquidated and eliminated.
[00:41:11.396 --> 00:41:20.838]  These Nazi elite, led by Zelensky, who love to see Christian Orthodox people fighting each other, reducing the population of those areas, they're not going to be around.
[00:41:20.858 --> 00:41:21.798]  They're not going to stick around.
[00:41:21.818 --> 00:41:35.527]   They've all got escape plans ready to go, to leave Ukraine, and that's where Russia maintains a very honourable position in this war and that's what history will thank
[00:41:35.527 --> 00:41:35.527]  Russia for.
[00:41:35.527 --> 00:41:36.527]  That's right.
[00:41:36.527 --> 00:41:39.086]  That they're totally happy to fight to the last Ukrainian.
[00:41:39.086 --> 00:41:40.927]  Ozzy Kosak, how do people find you?
[00:41:40.927 --> 00:41:46.045]  @OzzyKosak on X and how else do people find you?
[00:41:46.045 --> 00:41:48.527]  Check out Ozzy Kosak on Telegram and on Rumble.
[00:41:48.527 --> 00:41:50.487]  Alright, join me again in the next few days.
[00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:51.490]  This is big.
[00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:54.371]  This shows the globalists are really doing some crazy gambles.
[00:41:55.031 --> 00:41:58.212]  Obama went and visited 10 Downing Street last week.
[00:41:58.852 --> 00:42:01.173]  I think, as usual, the British are involved in this.
[00:42:01.193 --> 00:42:02.114]  What do you think, Rossi?
[00:42:04.354 --> 00:42:04.774]  Absolutely.
[00:42:05.135 --> 00:42:06.875]  The British have... There's a theory, right?
[00:42:06.975 --> 00:42:07.795]  Unconfirmed sources.
[00:42:07.875 --> 00:42:11.837]  I am in the Russian consulate and have been here for the last 467 days.
[00:42:11.917 --> 00:42:13.077]  Oh, I didn't know you were in Russia.
[00:42:13.097 --> 00:42:13.837]  You're in Russia, too?
[00:42:15.177 --> 00:42:21.657]   I'm in the Australian, Sydney, Russian consulate, away from the persecution from the Australian government,
[00:42:21.657 --> 00:42:24.897]   and I'm happy to do a prisoner swap, but Navalny died, so that didn't work out.
[00:42:24.897 --> 00:42:26.417]  We'll have to find another one.
[00:42:26.417 --> 00:42:32.536]   If the Australian government, the British government, the American government, they all knew about this attack.
[00:42:32.536 --> 00:42:33.938]  They all knew what was going on.
[00:42:33.938 --> 00:42:36.257]  They obviously had advance warning.
[00:42:36.257 --> 00:42:37.657]  They're setting a dangerous precedent.
[00:42:37.657 --> 00:42:42.337]   If they're not sharing intel with the Russian government about this impending terrorist attack,
[00:42:42.337 --> 00:42:43.777]  they're partly to blame.
[00:42:43.777 --> 00:42:48.837]   the british the americans they knew it was going Sure, they gave them a basic warning publicly but not actual intel.
[00:42:48.857 --> 00:42:50.559]  They said, wait a minute, this is a whole other story.
[00:42:50.819 --> 00:42:53.722]  They arrested you for your free speech famously on TV at your house.
[00:42:54.383 --> 00:42:58.247]  You are now living at the Russian embassy?
[00:42:58.527 --> 00:43:00.209]  They're still trying to put you in jail for speech?
[00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:05.253]  467 days consecutively locked into the Russian Embassy building.
[00:43:05.914 --> 00:43:11.199]  Vladimir Putin gave me a passport in October via presidential degree, so thank you to the President.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.842]  And the police can't walk in the territory.
[00:43:14.582 --> 00:43:17.325]  I'm very happy where I am, but I'd love to go straight to Moscow.
[00:43:17.825 --> 00:43:22.610]  And again, for listeners that don't know, you were arrested for leading protests against lockdowns.
[00:43:23.491 --> 00:43:25.092]  I follow you, but I didn't know this was going on.
[00:43:25.413 --> 00:43:26.514]  That's a whole other story!
[00:43:28.726 --> 00:43:29.186]  Absolutely.
[00:43:29.246 --> 00:43:49.258]  Look, the police have been after me for quite a while and there was an arrest where I breached the suppression order, 10 months jail for that, and I was on parole for that charge trying to leave the country when they set me up with some Ukrainian protesters, did a argy-bargy, push and shove, and the police decided to revoke my warrant and grab me to go to jail, but we were too quick for them.
[00:43:49.479 --> 00:43:56.980]   We made a break straight to the Russian consulate and I said, I'm not going to risk being in the custody of the state because Right now I'm not a threat.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.381]  Well you were a threat to their lockdowns.
[00:44:00.522 --> 00:44:01.763]  You're on the show this week if you'll do it.
[00:44:02.323 --> 00:44:02.743]  You alone.
[00:44:02.803 --> 00:44:06.526]  Thank you AussieCossack at AussieCossack on X. Wow.
[00:44:06.886 --> 00:44:09.147]  Alright, 60 second closing comment.
[00:44:09.508 --> 00:44:10.969]  Please come back on Syrian Girl.
[00:44:11.289 --> 00:44:13.610]  Everybody can obviously follow you.
[00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:16.152]  Just type in Syrian Girl on X. Partisan Girl.
[00:44:16.832 --> 00:44:17.573]  What else do you want to add?
[00:44:17.593 --> 00:44:19.334]  I'm going to go to Scott Bennett who's been patiently holding.
[00:44:21.484 --> 00:44:35.555]  Just quickly, if you look at the number of civilians that were killed in the Ukrainian war and the number of civilians that were killed in Gaza, you have 13,000 children killed in Gaza, you have less than 1,000 children killed in Ukraine.
[00:44:36.636 --> 00:44:44.886]  In three months of war or genocide in Gaza compared to Ukraine, obviously the gloves in Russia were not off during all of this time.
[00:44:45.706 --> 00:44:47.488]  But the war is escalating.
[00:44:47.508 --> 00:44:51.213]  Look, we know who the bad guys are, guys.
[00:44:51.773 --> 00:45:01.477]  If anyone who's been paying attention for the last 20-30 years knows that these people are what they're capable of and they're capable of killing civilians and they don't care, okay?
[00:45:01.777 --> 00:45:23.329]   And the fact that Jared Kushner, that he wants to sell Gaza real estate, like these people, the CIA, Mossad, they're prepared to kill every last civilian in Moscow and I think that Moscow is doing the right thing By defending its territory, because NATO is the one that's encroaching on the borders of Russia, not the other way around.
[00:45:23.629 --> 00:45:24.870]  So let's not forget about that.
[00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:31.915]  Absolutely, but the issue is blowing up the pipeline, sending in cross-border attacks in Russia every week.
[00:45:32.416 --> 00:45:33.396]  This isn't in our news.
[00:45:34.037 --> 00:45:39.361]  This is our government trying to punch Russia in the nose till it attacks us.
[00:45:39.421 --> 00:45:40.802]  This is insanity.
[00:45:40.842 --> 00:45:41.883]  Seringer, I'll talk to you soon.
[00:45:41.923 --> 00:45:42.243]  Be safe.
[00:45:44.534 --> 00:45:45.911]  Thank you very much, Alex Jones.
[00:45:46.488 --> 00:45:56.336]  All right, Scott Bennett is a very well-known author and researcher, GlobalFreedomTV.com, and he's just spent months in Russia and on the front lines in Ukraine, incredible videos and reports.
[00:45:56.376 --> 00:46:06.344]  He's back in the United States, and he joins us here ahead of Vladimir Soluyev joining us coming up in just a little while.
[00:46:06.424 --> 00:46:07.685]  Jack Masovas will be popping in as well.
[00:46:07.725 --> 00:46:10.968]  Thanks for holding for 15 minutes, but I saw you nodding your head here.
[00:46:10.988 --> 00:46:15.712]  I'm going to try to shut up and give you the floor to host the next 15 minutes and give us your analysis, sir.
[00:46:17.355 --> 00:46:20.940]  Well, I had the great honor of meeting Syrian Girl when I was in Moscow.
[00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:24.966]  I was at a few different conferences, and she does great work, as all your guests do.
[00:46:25.206 --> 00:46:30.073]  I also met Vladimir Solyov when I was back in Russia.
[00:46:30.093 --> 00:46:31.655]  I was on his show a couple of times.
[00:46:32.014 --> 00:46:41.720]  I met the pranksters too, Alex, that do the pranking, calling Bush and these other mentally challenged individuals pretending to be Zelensky.
[00:46:42.201 --> 00:46:51.186]  And I don't know if you know it, but the most recent guy they pranked was the gaunt, cancer-riddled cousin of Jabba the Hutt, Mike Pompeo.
[00:46:51.687 --> 00:46:53.208]  So they pranked Pompeo.
[00:46:53.288 --> 00:46:56.109]  I don't think it's gotten public yet, but they sent me a picture.
[00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:59.131]  So I met some very colorful people.
[00:46:59.832 --> 00:47:01.233]  And it adds to...
[00:47:02.008 --> 00:47:09.271]  You know, the dexterity of the imagination of the Russian people and culture, people don't really calculate this properly.
[00:47:09.351 --> 00:47:18.374]  And I don't insult the retarded globalists and their minions, Biden and the rest of these fools, because I enjoy it, even though I do.
[00:47:19.034 --> 00:47:22.516]  I insult them because they're mentally scrambled.
[00:47:22.656 --> 00:47:26.958]  Their minds, the gears of their mind have been filled with gravel.
[00:47:27.078 --> 00:47:30.619]  And there's very important biblical principles involved here.
[00:47:31.279 --> 00:47:48.573]  When you digest lies and believe lies, when you become a nation of lies, building your wars on lies and feeding these lies to your soldiers and everyone else, you begin to cultivate a degree of insanity, a degree of schizophrenia.
[00:47:48.973 --> 00:47:51.536]  That's the definition of transgenderism and such.
[00:47:51.896 --> 00:48:08.430]   So I watch America eclipsing into a schizophrenic nation, not as an insult, but as a Psychological Officer, a profiling of the mental conditions and their variables and methodologies and formulas for calculating reality.
[00:48:08.931 --> 00:48:30.788]   And I am astounded at the absence of truth and fact in the calculations of political reality that is coming out of Washington, out of Kirby's mouth, out of Sullivan's mouth, out of Of course, all of the demon crats in Washington and Congress's mouth, and of course, the old senile shuffling Biden who's being played by Obama.
[00:48:31.388 --> 00:48:41.312]  We are at a stage in America where we have the most grotesquely incompetent, stupid, and evil people pulling the levers and pushing the buttons of national power.
[00:48:41.952 --> 00:48:56.565]  And expending American dollars on terrorists such as these who have just been found and caught and will soon find a very painful end to their lives, I hope, in Russia in this Moscow attack.
[00:48:57.005 --> 00:49:00.108]  So when you ask the question, why are the globalists doing this?
[00:49:00.208 --> 00:49:00.528]  Why?
[00:49:00.608 --> 00:49:01.869]  What are they seeking to achieve?
[00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:14.693]   Part of it is their disconnect from reality and they honestly believe and they project Their lies thinking others believe them when no one else believes them except themselves.
[00:49:15.133 --> 00:49:41.129]   And it's very important to understand that because otherwise you get frustrated trying to explain and understand their There are scratches in the record, if you will, that afflict these people, and there's no way out of it unless they repent, unless, you know, there's a complete humbling and religious experience like Saul of Tarsus, which I don't think is coming to them.
[00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:48.034]  I think there's a dark age eclipsing America in general, and they are a sign of that.
[00:49:48.394 --> 00:49:51.315]  Now, at the same time, there's a brightness growing in America.
[00:49:51.375 --> 00:49:58.196]  There's a brightness in the states declaring independence from this tyranny of fascism in Washington, D.C.
[00:49:58.216 --> 00:50:07.098]  There's a brightness of states returning and celebrating, you know, the Make America Great Again ideas and principles.
[00:50:07.158 --> 00:50:09.779]  And it's not about Trump, it's about the ideas in general.
[00:50:10.479 --> 00:50:12.919]  And, you know, that's the dichotomy.
[00:50:12.999 --> 00:50:23.981]   The other thing to watch in this case is, and when I was in Donbass, I saw people from all over the world coming to help fight the Ukrainians on the Russian side.
[00:50:24.062 --> 00:50:32.428]  People from Japan, Korea, Serbia, Africa, other parts of Europe, Tajikistan, Dagestan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, India.
[00:50:33.109 --> 00:50:39.434]  They are going to be multiplied a hundred times because of this event.
[00:50:40.063 --> 00:50:43.985]  You thought you saw foreign mercenaries coming to help Russia two months ago?
[00:50:44.426 --> 00:50:55.332]  You're gonna see a hundred times more foreign mercenaries coming to help Russia extinguish the black flames of this death plague called Zelensky and his Nazi cult.
[00:50:56.276 --> 00:50:57.938]  More than you've ever seen before.
[00:50:58.298 --> 00:51:10.310]  That's what's giving me great joy and courage is the world's going to be coming to Russia's side like they did when they thought 9-11 was a real event, which it wasn't.
[00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:11.551]  It was a complete false flag.
[00:51:11.571 --> 00:51:12.192]  We all know that.
[00:51:13.007 --> 00:51:21.594]  But now you're going to see people coming to Russia's side, and there's no chance, I think, that this is a false flag on Russia's side.
[00:51:21.614 --> 00:51:22.634]  Let's just put that to rest.
[00:51:22.674 --> 00:51:35.504]  When you see an AK-47 shot at point-blank range, and the expulsion of the fire out of the muzzle barrel, and I know what they look like when they eject the bullet, and you have flames going four different directions.
[00:51:35.544 --> 00:51:36.365]  That's a real bullet.
[00:51:36.785 --> 00:51:39.788]  And you see the impact, and I saw this from a distance.
[00:51:39.848 --> 00:51:41.049]  I thought, wow, this is real.
[00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:42.810]  Shooting out the glass and stuff.
[00:51:43.762 --> 00:51:48.886]  So, there's no question that this was a real assassination by terrorists.
[00:51:48.926 --> 00:51:50.227]  Hopped up on Captagon.
[00:51:50.468 --> 00:51:52.129]  We know Captagon from Syria.
[00:51:52.169 --> 00:51:59.715]  We know the Saudis were funneling it in in airplanes to the ISIS blue helmets or white helmet British mercenaries.
[00:51:59.735 --> 00:52:02.937]  Which is exactly what the Nazis did, fueling their troops with methamphetamine.
[00:52:04.158 --> 00:52:04.659]  That's right.
[00:52:04.839 --> 00:52:05.299]  That's right.
[00:52:05.359 --> 00:52:08.862]  That's how you get psychopaths, Frankenstein monsters going on rampages.
[00:52:08.882 --> 00:52:11.464]  That's how you create an artificial psychopath is methamphetamine.
[00:52:12.844 --> 00:52:13.264]  That's right.
[00:52:13.424 --> 00:52:16.706]  And the Ukrainians aren't far from that anyway without methamphetamine.
[00:52:16.746 --> 00:52:19.127]  So it's not a hard transition.
[00:52:19.307 --> 00:52:22.388]  They're already mentally challenged in many, many different ways.
[00:52:22.448 --> 00:52:27.070]  There's a whole profiling of the Ukrainian mind, which is one of the reasons they were chosen.
[00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:32.873]  They're already sort of the hills have eyes, challenged and mentally deranged.
[00:52:33.353 --> 00:52:40.636]  But this is going to spell the absolute end of the Ukrainian experiment.
[00:52:41.252 --> 00:52:43.273]  And Russia's not going to overreact.
[00:52:43.293 --> 00:52:44.293]  We've talked about this.
[00:52:44.713 --> 00:52:46.574]  They're going to be surgical in their application.
[00:52:46.894 --> 00:52:48.095]  I would add this too, Alex.
[00:52:48.135 --> 00:52:54.877]  When I was back in Russia in November doing the filming of the Donbass event, I stood in front of the U.S.
[00:52:55.037 --> 00:53:07.702]  Embassy and read the flyers they put on the billboard that said terrorist attacks were imminent in theaters, in big public gatherings.
[00:53:09.175 --> 00:53:12.598]  I think I sent it to Daria.
[00:53:12.638 --> 00:53:15.860]  I put it up on my pages.
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:30.151]  They did a lot of Russian interviews with me, but I'll never forget that clip, and I've still got it on my phone, of me reading the State Department warnings of, you know, terrorist events are imminent, and I thought, wow, they knew about it.
[00:53:30.171 --> 00:53:30.491]  Absolutely.
[00:53:30.531 --> 00:53:35.154]   Postelbic predicted it, but I forgot you came on like, Three months ago I predicted it too.
[00:53:35.194 --> 00:53:35.875]  That's the problem.
[00:53:35.995 --> 00:53:37.155]  Everything we say comes true.
[00:53:37.596 --> 00:53:41.018]  We're not trying to prove ourselves, but people need to know, we're over the target.
[00:53:41.038 --> 00:53:42.058]  We're not making stuff up.
[00:53:42.339 --> 00:53:45.100]  That's why I've always guessed it's people that are right over and over again.
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:45.761]  So let me ask you this.
[00:53:47.022 --> 00:53:47.762]  We're looking at this.
[00:53:47.842 --> 00:53:52.444]  It shows desperation and sanity by the globalists, which we can laugh at, but also shows how dangerous they are.
[00:53:53.104 --> 00:53:58.747]  What about the ISIS and other groups that are being funded and Hezbollah cutouts that really aren't even with Iran?
[00:53:59.287 --> 00:54:09.291]  The massive military age men brought into this country and how the left says, oh, there'll be a big Black Lives Matter, Muslim, Antifa uprising if Trump wins.
[00:54:09.491 --> 00:54:11.432]  Clearly, they're getting that ready.
[00:54:12.192 --> 00:54:16.014]  And we can show some of the B-roll, the border totally collapsing Thursday in El Paso.
[00:54:17.352 --> 00:54:18.974]  And so how does that calculus enter into this?
[00:54:18.994 --> 00:54:20.195]  Because they think we're so stupid.
[00:54:21.456 --> 00:54:24.679]  We don't know ISIS is Mossad, CIA, though it's on record it is.
[00:54:24.979 --> 00:54:26.781]  We do, we just showed the Jerusalem Post admitting it.
[00:54:28.002 --> 00:54:30.785]  They think they'll have ISIS blow everything up here.
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:38.000]   A hundred little 911s that will be bigger than 911 and then we'll be so dumb that we don't know the government brought
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:38.800]  them in and protected them.
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:41.899]  But that's clearly what's being pre-programmed in my mind.
[00:54:41.899 --> 00:54:42.800]  So we now talk about America.
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:47.800]   Because, yeah, I understand what's happening in Russia. It's important. It's crazy the globalists are.
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:50.800]   But what does it mean for us? What does it mean about the brain rot?
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:52.800]  That was a perfect analogy of the dirt in the air.
[00:54:52.875 --> 00:54:58.558]  And there's no redeeming of them because they would rather rule over a country of ashes than, you know, be removed from office.
[00:54:58.578 --> 00:54:59.979]  Rule in hell than serve in heaven.
[00:54:59.798 --> 00:55:03.478]   when the Russians are 100 yards away, still thinking Steiner was going to save him.
[00:55:03.478 --> 00:55:05.838]  It is that mentality.
[00:55:05.838 --> 00:55:06.838]  Yeah.
[00:55:06.838 --> 00:55:14.358]   And, uh, there's no redeeming of them because they would rather rule over a country of ashes
[00:55:14.358 --> 00:55:17.719]  than, uh, you know, be removed from office.
[00:55:17.719 --> 00:55:20.438]  Rule in hell than serve in heaven.
[00:55:20.438 --> 00:55:21.958]  That's right.
[00:55:21.958 --> 00:55:26.317]  And they really are narcissistic psychopaths.
[00:55:26.401 --> 00:55:28.844]  I mean, beyond any decency.
[00:55:28.904 --> 00:55:36.732]  And the only way to deal with them, Alex, like any bully, is to hit them right in the nose so hard they go down and they forget their own name.
[00:55:37.165 --> 00:55:40.248]  Politically speaking, but also literally speaking, I might add.
[00:55:40.809 --> 00:55:52.100]  So, we see Schumer, and we see Mitch McConnell, and we see all Romney, and we see all of these parasites in Congress and elsewhere, the deep state embedded in the CIA, NSA.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:53.721]  D.I.A.
[00:55:53.901 --> 00:55:59.787]  from Obama's time that Trump never removed, and I advocated for an Inspector General czar.
[00:56:00.187 --> 00:56:02.509]  Perhaps you can fill that role when Trump returns.
[00:56:02.970 --> 00:56:11.338]  An Inspector General czar, a cabinet-level position, would be the overseer and the commander of every Inspector General in every federal agency.
[00:56:11.778 --> 00:56:25.825]  And that Inspector General Zara would say, I want to empty the computers and the closets of every floor in your agency and I'm going to audit every single federal employee and if I don't like the color of their tie or the smell of their cologne, they're suspended.
[00:56:26.545 --> 00:56:30.585]   They can go home with pay, I don't care, but they're not going to show up and use our computer
[00:56:30.585 --> 00:56:33.384]  systems to undermine President Trump.
[00:56:33.384 --> 00:56:35.505]  That was his failure because he didn't do that.
[00:56:35.505 --> 00:56:36.505]  That's right.
[00:56:36.505 --> 00:56:40.105]   He left the Obama stay behind networks and that's when, not to write myself in the story,
[00:56:40.105 --> 00:56:41.105]  but it's true.
[00:56:41.105 --> 00:56:46.306]   I knew about the Obama and the defense authorization right before he left in January 2017, doing
[00:56:46.306 --> 00:56:50.744]   the Foreign Disinformation Propaganda Act, listing us all as Russian agents when we weren't.
[00:56:50.744 --> 00:56:53.985]   And I was, when Trump would call up and try to say, "Oh, thanks for your help."
[00:56:53.985 --> 00:56:55.384]  of just being like a political person.
[00:56:55.384 --> 00:56:57.785]  I'd say, listen, sir, you've got Fiona Hill.
[00:56:57.806 --> 00:56:58.807]  You've got McMaster.
[00:56:58.847 --> 00:56:59.608]  You've got these people.
[00:56:59.929 --> 00:57:00.890]  These are the stay-behind networks.
[00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:01.872]  You've got to get them out of there.
[00:57:02.172 --> 00:57:05.377]  They literally started death-threatening my parents that day.
[00:57:06.238 --> 00:57:07.919]  Of course, my parents said, we want you to fight harder now.
[00:57:08.099 --> 00:57:11.520]  And that's the thing, the left gets threatened, they back off.
[00:57:11.641 --> 00:57:12.761]  We get threatened, we fight back.
[00:57:13.301 --> 00:57:19.004]  All we've got to do, there's plenty of crimes, is start indicting a few globalists, they'll all run for the hills.
[00:57:19.224 --> 00:57:23.486]  They're like a rotting house, an old barn, when a tornado comes.
[00:57:23.546 --> 00:57:24.646]  It's going to collapse, folks.
[00:57:24.867 --> 00:57:25.567]  They're a joke.
[00:57:27.617 --> 00:57:40.385]  Alex, when I got back from Russia, I prepared, I typed on the plane a declaration of crimes against humanity, code violations, statute violations, constitutional violations, and sent it to members of Congress.
[00:57:41.046 --> 00:57:41.766]  I'm a U.S.
[00:57:41.846 --> 00:57:42.587]  Army officer.
[00:57:42.707 --> 00:57:45.769]  I had State Department counterterrorism credentials.
[00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:47.510]  I worked under Ambassador Del Daly.
[00:57:47.590 --> 00:57:49.311]  I held a top-secret SCI clearance.
[00:57:49.371 --> 00:58:01.177]   I was in the Bush administration from 2003 to 2008, and I've just returned from the Donbass I'm reporting crimes against humanity, war crimes that demand the immediate attention of the United States Congress.
[00:58:02.318 --> 00:58:15.123]  The advancement of that, the notice, the legal notice that crimes are being committed by the Ukrainian mercenaries, the Ukrainian army, using American weapons and American money to bomb civilians in Donetsk, in Crimea.
[00:58:15.263 --> 00:58:17.604]  As a pretext to get Putin to respond?
[00:58:19.551 --> 00:58:22.092]  All of that was given notice to the members of Congress.
[00:58:22.132 --> 00:58:23.753]  That's how you put them on defense.
[00:58:23.813 --> 00:58:25.254]  That's how you put them to flight.
[00:58:25.714 --> 00:58:28.915]  You use the law system against them.
[00:58:29.496 --> 00:58:32.297]  Civil lawsuit, you're violating the rights of Americans.
[00:58:32.557 --> 00:58:40.441]  That's why when they deny Americans the right to vote for Trump, you could have hundreds and thousands of people file a 42 U.S.
[00:58:40.481 --> 00:58:42.602]  Code 1983 civil rights violation.
[00:58:42.902 --> 00:58:47.044]  You're violating my rights to vote for my candidate by removing him from the ballot.
[00:58:47.304 --> 00:58:48.565]  And by the way, that shows how they...
[00:58:49.125 --> 00:58:50.266]  You're right, you're right.
[00:58:50.286 --> 00:58:53.307]  But it requires men like you, Alex, and men like me, and men like others.
[00:58:53.127 --> 00:58:58.006]   Fiona Hill and Trump fired her. They indicted Roger Stone, tried to indict me over it,
[00:58:58.006 --> 00:59:03.046]   had a 60-minute special where she cried and said, "Alex Jones is mean to me."
[00:59:03.046 --> 00:59:07.066]  These people have never had pushback, Scott. You're right.
[00:59:07.066 --> 00:59:12.607]   You're right. But it requires men like you, Alex, and men like me and men like others, Presobiecki.
[00:59:12.607 --> 00:59:17.447]   There's so many brave people that are willing to stand in the middle of the meadow and
[00:59:17.447 --> 00:59:22.567]   paint their faces blue and unsheath their sword and say, "What will you do without freedom?"
[00:59:23.214 --> 00:59:23.895]  Will you fight?
[00:59:24.135 --> 00:59:37.806]  No, and you'll die many years later with a COVID vaccine up your rear and all sorts of tyrannical gaggings and transgender brainwashings and things like that done.
[00:59:38.206 --> 00:59:40.448]  This is the day to stand and fight.
[00:59:41.029 --> 00:59:43.931]  Well, that's it, Scott, because we're already under attack.
[00:59:43.951 --> 00:59:44.892]  They're not stopping.
[00:59:45.132 --> 00:59:47.354]  We have no choice, but total commitment.
[00:59:48.581 --> 00:59:49.562]  Total commitment.
[00:59:49.682 --> 00:59:53.445]  You have to run like your life depended on it, because it does.
[00:59:53.565 --> 00:59:55.346]  Remember that great scene from Braveheart?
[00:59:55.726 --> 01:00:00.970]  They ran like warrior poets, and I take great pride because I was born in Scotland.
[01:00:01.571 --> 01:00:02.892]  Fight like warrior poets.
[01:00:02.972 --> 01:00:05.454]  Swing your sword and scream.
[01:00:05.754 --> 01:00:09.477]  Fight naked like the old Picts used to do against the boy-raping Romans.
[01:00:09.977 --> 01:00:13.800]  But you're doing it against the same boy-raping globalists and Democrats.
[01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:25.946]   But I think people are awakening to this, and Russia knows The greatest of Americans are on their side, not because of any political affiliation, but because of family and spiritual values.
[01:00:25.986 --> 01:00:31.009]  It's a total cultural affiliation and these claims of the controlled right wing that Russia isn't for real.
[01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:32.609]  It's gone total Christian.
[01:00:32.949 --> 01:00:33.850]  It's already been at the bottom.
[01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:36.291]  It's coming up just like we're coming up right behind them.
[01:00:36.631 --> 01:00:37.571]  This is cultural.
[01:00:37.631 --> 01:00:42.533]  And then the resources of Russia, our resources, a total shake-up of the globe, huge space program.
[01:00:42.654 --> 01:00:43.434]  It needs to stop.
[01:00:43.714 --> 01:00:45.775]  World peace is America and Russia working together.
[01:00:46.701 --> 01:00:46.901]  Yes.
[01:00:47.201 --> 01:00:48.743]  And they're very humble people.
[01:00:49.003 --> 01:00:50.044]  They're very respectful.
[01:00:50.104 --> 01:00:51.906]  Your other guest is exactly right.
[01:00:51.946 --> 01:00:59.311]   It was what was said to me on the That the Russians would rather endure suffering than inflict suffering on others.
[01:00:59.731 --> 01:01:06.636]  And that's a tremendous depth of lesson that I'm still trying to fathom because I'm more hot-blooded than not.
[01:01:06.736 --> 01:01:08.317]  But the Russians are like that.
[01:01:08.417 --> 01:01:10.799]  They don't want to kill Ukrainians.
[01:01:10.879 --> 01:01:13.481]  They see them as Slavic brethren and cousins.
[01:01:13.901 --> 01:01:19.265]  I had a commander tell me point-blank, Scott, we don't want to kill Ukrainians.
[01:01:19.345 --> 01:01:20.986]  They're Russians.
[01:01:21.167 --> 01:01:23.088]  They're traitors, but they're Russians.
[01:01:23.843 --> 01:01:25.745]  I mean, it's an amazing thing to behold.
[01:01:25.845 --> 01:01:38.659]  So the patience and the endurance and the Christian kindness, I would say that, you know, turning the other cheek and not showing a violence and a vengeance.
[01:01:39.159 --> 01:01:41.622]  Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord, I shall repay.
[01:01:41.822 --> 01:01:44.385]  And he is repaying all of the wickedness.
[01:01:44.992 --> 01:01:52.715]  So the Russians are extremely patient and I'll tell you this is going to build up so much alliance for Russia from around the world.
[01:01:53.056 --> 01:01:57.177]  You talk about the false flags that are coming to the United States and you're exactly right.
[01:01:57.217 --> 01:01:57.918]  They're setting it up.
[01:01:58.098 --> 01:02:02.740]  I've said from the beginning this terrorist strike against Russia was meant to cause a recoil.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:11.649]  That would be impacting the United States, so that the Kirbys and the Bidens and the deep states could declare some kind of a martial law, some kind of an emergency.
[01:02:12.049 --> 01:02:13.130]  Oh, Russia's struck us.
[01:02:13.231 --> 01:02:14.212]  Russia's behind this.
[01:02:14.292 --> 01:02:25.942]   Because remember, they're absolute pathological liars, and their media are going to say, You know, Russia's taking action against NATO and European countries in America, so we have to commit troops.
[01:02:26.002 --> 01:02:27.323]  We have to initiate a draft.
[01:02:27.443 --> 01:02:29.384]  Everybody has to register for the civil service.
[01:02:29.645 --> 01:02:30.125]  Oh, guess what?
[01:02:30.165 --> 01:02:30.805]  We don't have enough.
[01:02:30.846 --> 01:02:36.169]  Let's just get the Mexicans, the Central Americans, and the Haitians and put them in a military uniform.
[01:02:36.490 --> 01:02:40.773]  Oh, we won't send you to Ukraine yet because we're in such dire straits in the United States.
[01:02:40.793 --> 01:02:42.834]  We're going to have your guns on American citizens.
[01:02:42.894 --> 01:02:55.924]   So the good white people of Texas, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, those states that are a little bit too masculine for us, We're going to have you, Pedro and Machiavelli from Haitia, we're going to have you watch them and control them and report on them.
[01:02:55.964 --> 01:02:59.927]  And we have a federal judge saying illegal aliens can own guns but not citizens.
[01:03:01.168 --> 01:03:02.910]  I mean, they are bringing in these groups.
[01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:03.810]  They're controlling them.
[01:03:04.331 --> 01:03:09.175]  ISIS is run by NATO, run by the criminals that have hijacked our government, run by Israel.
[01:03:09.215 --> 01:03:09.956]  I'm not anti-Israel.
[01:03:09.996 --> 01:03:10.776]  It's just a fact.
[01:03:11.016 --> 01:03:11.957]  Here's Jerusalem Post.
[01:03:12.538 --> 01:03:15.160]  Israel treating al-Qaeda fighters wounded in Syrian war.
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:16.321]  Right here.
[01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:17.082]  Overhead shot.
[01:03:17.462 --> 01:03:19.163]  I mean, this is the reality, folks.
[01:03:19.724 --> 01:03:20.624]  So it's the truth.
[01:03:20.705 --> 01:03:21.445]  My job is easy.
[01:03:21.505 --> 01:03:22.106]  I just tell the truth.
[01:03:23.152 --> 01:03:34.055]  And you have Ukraine sending drone strikes and cross-border attacks, and you have Fareed Zakaria, the mouth of the globalists, last week saying, we're going to target Russians in Russia to show them and intimidate them.
[01:03:34.955 --> 01:03:38.296]  I showed the clip earlier, and I said this week, terror attacks are imminent.
[01:03:38.316 --> 01:03:40.857]  Jack Posobiec, really smart guy, former Naval Intelligence.
[01:03:41.297 --> 01:03:41.937]  It's imminent.
[01:03:42.017 --> 01:03:43.817]  They say Putin blew up the Nord Stream pipeline.
[01:03:44.158 --> 01:03:44.878]  No one's buying it.
[01:03:44.918 --> 01:03:46.858]  Scott Bennett, talk to you soon.
[01:03:47.178 --> 01:03:48.619]  GlobalFreedomTV.com.
[01:03:48.639 --> 01:03:49.279]  Thank you so much.
[01:03:50.221 --> 01:03:51.221]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:03:51.221 --> 01:03:52.840]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:59.760]   And Vladimir Solovyev is going to be joining us coming up in just a few minutes.
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.340]  The top Russian broadcaster.
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:06.661]   He's got a lot of intel and a lot of information, but this is so dangerous because the globalists
[01:04:06.661 --> 01:04:12.420]   are so reckless to do this and then think that we don't know ISIS is run by the criminals
[01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:16.099]   that have hijacked our government and have imploded our border and have exported and
[01:04:16.099 --> 01:04:21.380]   imported these Islamists into America, preparing massive sleeper cell false flags that will
[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:23.420]  make what happened in Russia look like a cakewalk.
[01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:38.399]  We'll be right back with our special guest.
[01:04:38.722 --> 01:04:40.843]  You better believe you've got one!
[01:04:42.804 --> 01:04:49.804]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:04:49.804 --> 01:05:08.804]  Zack, this is Crystal Palace.
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:09.060]  Inc.
[01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:11.001]  NORAD has declared DEFCON 3.
[01:05:11.061 --> 01:05:12.381]  Scramble all alert aircraft.
[01:05:12.882 --> 01:05:14.782]  I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.
[01:05:16.343 --> 01:05:20.105]  The Whopper spends all its time thinking about World War 3.
[01:05:20.345 --> 01:05:22.306]  Target selection complete.
[01:05:22.366 --> 01:05:24.227]  Time on target sequence complete.
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:31.143]  22 Typhoon-class submarines departing Petropavlovsk, turning south out of Nordkapp, bearing 095 degrees.
[01:05:31.303 --> 01:05:36.226]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan Air Defense Zone.
[01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:43.650]  From the front lines of the Information War... Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode.
[01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:44.370]  We are at DEFCON 1.
[01:05:47.481 --> 01:05:49.762]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[01:05:49.882 --> 01:05:50.462]  You bet!
[01:05:50.862 --> 01:05:55.023]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:05:55.183 --> 01:05:58.144]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[01:05:59.265 --> 01:06:03.326]  3... 2... 1... Impact!
[01:06:03.586 --> 01:06:05.507]  Shall we play a game?
[01:06:05.487 --> 01:06:16.487]  How about global thermonuclear war?
[01:06:16.437 --> 01:06:18.438]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready.
[01:06:18.718 --> 01:06:19.599]  Awaiting launch codes.
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:21.481]  We are on a launch mode.
[01:06:21.941 --> 01:06:25.504]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation?
[01:06:25.864 --> 01:06:29.787]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:30.247 --> 01:06:30.587]  We're in!
[01:06:31.664 --> 01:06:33.065]  The Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[01:06:33.525 --> 01:06:35.567]  We have a Soviet submarine launch detection.
[01:06:36.047 --> 01:06:37.708]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[01:06:38.088 --> 01:06:39.569]  I wish I was like everybody else.
[01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:44.830]  Then again, the only winning rule is not to play.
[01:06:44.830 --> 01:06:51.830]  [Music]
[01:06:51.830 --> 01:06:57.830]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:58.422 --> 01:07:00.425]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready.
[01:07:00.705 --> 01:07:01.606]  Awaiting launch codes.
[01:07:02.287 --> 01:07:03.468]  We are on a launch mode.
[01:07:03.929 --> 01:07:07.513]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation?
[01:07:07.854 --> 01:07:11.758]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:07:12.219 --> 01:07:12.559]  We're in!
[01:07:13.683 --> 01:07:15.064]  The Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[01:07:15.504 --> 01:07:17.604]  We have a Soviet submarine launch detection.
[01:07:18.025 --> 01:07:19.685]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[01:07:20.085 --> 01:07:21.546]  I wish I was like everybody else.
[01:07:22.006 --> 01:07:23.027]  Game to end.
[01:07:23.627 --> 01:07:26.608]  The only winning move is not to play.
[01:07:30.936 --> 01:07:44.784]  That promo you just saw was from 10 years ago, where we predicted this could lead to World War III, and it was the globalist project to manipulate and attack Russia into a confrontation with NATO.
[01:07:44.844 --> 01:07:48.306]  We are now closer to nuclear war than we have ever been!
[01:07:48.326 --> 01:07:56.971]  And we have inbred, psychotic, crazy people, a bunch of Trotskyites who got kicked out of Russia, and a bunch of Nazis that got their ass kicked in Crimea.
[01:07:57.891 --> 01:08:01.334]  80 years ago, still trying to fight the last war with the Russians.
[01:08:02.875 --> 01:08:06.898]  And then they said, we're going to launch terror attacks on CNN last week, Marine Zarkaria.
[01:08:07.158 --> 01:08:09.399]  They've launched drone attacks, cross-border attacks.
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:12.942]  And then ISIS is known, CIA, MI6, Mossad.
[01:08:13.162 --> 01:08:22.869]  And then they turn around and tell us that Putin's a liar, that no, he did it, with no evidence, even though they caught these rats trying to run back into Ukraine.
[01:08:24.346 --> 01:08:25.566]  This is insane.
[01:08:26.487 --> 01:08:33.770]  The top broadcaster in Russia is Vladimir Solovyov, and he joins us right now for the Balance of the Hour.
[01:08:33.790 --> 01:08:39.712]  He just ended his emergency Saturday broadcast, and we're doing ours here as well, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:40.192 --> 01:08:42.233]  So, Vladimir, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:08:42.253 --> 01:08:47.415]  I'm going to try to give you the floor, because you've got more intel than anybody right there, talking to all the people on the ground.
[01:08:47.455 --> 01:08:49.716]  We've already had reporters that are in Moscow on the show.
[01:08:50.697 --> 01:08:57.943]  To me, this is very sad for the 130 plus that have died and those that are in the process of fighting for their lives and obviously more will die.
[01:08:58.904 --> 01:09:05.130]  But for me, it shows the psychoticness of the people that have hijacked my country who are a threat to me and my family.
[01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:11.215]  So my solidarity with Russia is my solidarity with sanity and not wanting World War III as a loyal American.
[01:09:11.255 --> 01:09:12.116]  You're a loyal Russian.
[01:09:12.396 --> 01:09:13.437]  So thank you for joining us.
[01:09:13.477 --> 01:09:14.518]  Now it's very late in Russia.
[01:09:14.838 --> 01:09:15.639]  You've got the floor, sir.
[01:09:17.734 --> 01:09:30.064]  Thank you, Alex, and thank you to all Americans that send their very warm words to Russians who do suffer from one of the worst terrorist attacks in the history of our country.
[01:09:30.825 --> 01:09:31.825]  We can compare with 9-11.
[01:09:31.845 --> 01:09:34.528]  During 9-11, there were almost 5,000 people that were killed.
[01:09:34.368 --> 01:09:38.128]  there were almost 5,000 people that were killed.
[01:09:38.128 --> 01:09:47.168]   This terrorist attack was aiming to kill 6,200 people that attended the concert.
[01:09:47.168 --> 01:09:55.847]   So far, more than 140 people died, but unfortunately, the amount of deaths will only increase.
[01:09:56.157 --> 01:09:58.339]  A lot of people injured.
[01:09:59.119 --> 01:09:59.799]  So what happened?
[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:02.881]  I can show you actually on the screen.
[01:10:02.901 --> 01:10:05.802]  We made a little presentation of how it all happened.
[01:10:06.543 --> 01:10:09.304]  If my guys will get my computer on.
[01:10:09.944 --> 01:10:11.205]  Guys can you show the picture?
[01:10:12.122 --> 01:10:12.562]  Yes, please.
[01:10:13.043 --> 01:10:14.004]  So that's what happened.
[01:10:14.064 --> 01:10:23.372]  A group of four people that were recruited through Telegram for not a huge amount of money, one million rubles each, they entered the facility.
[01:10:23.392 --> 01:10:28.877]  It took them about ten minutes to get straight into the concert hall.
[01:10:29.037 --> 01:10:31.118]  On the way, they killed a lot of people.
[01:10:31.819 --> 01:10:35.622]  Then they threw cocktail molotov grenades.
[01:10:36.383 --> 01:10:39.726]  They started fire and immediately left the building.
[01:10:40.473 --> 01:10:56.037]  Then they got on the car that were waiting for them and tried to move toward borderline with Ukraine where they were waited by Ukrainian special forces that were planning to help them to get out through Russian-Ukrainian border.
[01:10:56.597 --> 01:11:08.512]   But they were stopped by Russian police and special services and through a couple of hours of search Hide-and-seek operation, we managed to get them all.
[01:11:08.992 --> 01:11:09.912]  They're all alive.
[01:11:10.633 --> 01:11:11.333]  They're talking.
[01:11:11.633 --> 01:11:18.697]  They have no idea that they were ISIS, as they were told by United States and British and other officials.
[01:11:19.497 --> 01:11:21.839]  No, they were not ISIS fighters.
[01:11:22.539 --> 01:11:24.100]  They didn't want to die.
[01:11:24.898 --> 01:11:29.701]  For whatever they believe in, like Islam, they wanted to live and to spend money.
[01:11:30.542 --> 01:11:34.624]  Not a lot of money, a million rubles, it's like 10,000 bucks.
[01:11:36.548 --> 01:11:40.352]  So for $10,000 they killed an enormous amount of people.
[01:11:40.992 --> 01:11:42.714]  They were recruited through Telegram.
[01:11:42.834 --> 01:11:49.040]  That's a well-known way of recruiting that has been done already by Ukrainian special forces.
[01:11:49.661 --> 01:11:54.626]  And there were a couple of terrorist attacks inside Russia done this way.
[01:11:55.447 --> 01:11:55.687]  Money?
[01:11:56.559 --> 01:12:00.980]  Telegram, they're finding special guys, give them exact instructions.
[01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:10.242]  It's obvious that those guys were not able to come up with this rather sophisticated plan because the building itself is not an easy one.
[01:12:10.842 --> 01:12:13.202]  So you have to know where to go and what to do.
[01:12:13.963 --> 01:12:18.904]  They knew exactly, exactly what the game plan is.
[01:12:19.504 --> 01:12:20.824]  And they played by this game.
[01:12:20.864 --> 01:12:26.105]  But our special forces were one step faster and better.
[01:12:27.017 --> 01:12:30.498]  Then we saw this operation of cover-up.
[01:12:31.218 --> 01:12:36.820]  Cover-up operation, stating that, no, no, no, that is not Ukrainian.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.620]  Definitely it's not Ukrainian.
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:39.521]  It's a lie.
[01:12:40.161 --> 01:12:55.505]  Because right now, on the other side of the Russian-Ukrainian border, we saw enormous activity of Ukrainian special forces that worked hand-in-hand with Islamic terrorist organizations.
[01:12:56.738 --> 01:12:58.979]  So we know that they're fighting hand-in-hand.
[01:12:59.179 --> 01:13:00.079]  Who's behind them?
[01:13:00.579 --> 01:13:09.582]  We know for sure, thanks to New York Times article, that they were trained by CIA and other special agencies of the United States.
[01:13:10.122 --> 01:13:28.738]   That's why when Victoria Nuland a couple of months ago stated that President Putin will get a lot of nasty surprises on the borderline, So now we see what's in her definition borderline is and what kind of nasty surprises she planned for our country.
[01:13:29.239 --> 01:13:47.612]  There's only one leader of Western world who didn't express his feelings toward Russians and they didn't send the right words, who didn't mourn with us, who didn't support Russian people after this awful attack.
[01:13:47.632 --> 01:13:58.868]   This is Zelensky, this little drug addict personality, managed to blame Russian President Putin for this attack.
[01:13:58.888 --> 01:14:01.868]  He's the only person in the world who did that.
[01:14:03.008 --> 01:14:08.929]  Even President Biden, although he hated and he hates Putin, didn't come up with this.
[01:14:09.550 --> 01:14:14.870]  But Zelensky could not find even one word toward Russian citizens.
[01:14:15.991 --> 01:14:29.111]   And actually, as we talk right now, There's a huge attack on Russian city Belgorod, and every time they hit Belgorod, and it has nothing to do with military infrastructure.
[01:14:29.611 --> 01:14:30.692]  I've been there yesterday.
[01:14:31.453 --> 01:14:34.675]  They hit hospitals, and they hit huge apartment houses.
[01:14:35.435 --> 01:14:40.679]  And they hit them with NATO weaponry, artillery provided by Czech Republic.
[01:14:41.636 --> 01:14:45.037]  And as of now, they attack Crimea and Sevastopol.
[01:14:45.598 --> 01:14:48.219]  That's why, actually, I'm really surprised, Alex.
[01:14:48.699 --> 01:14:58.183]  Why do all those NATO guys trying to show their empathy to Russian people when they love when someone is killing us?
[01:14:58.963 --> 01:15:02.164]  They supply Ukrainian Nazis with all weapon in the world.
[01:15:02.965 --> 01:15:07.687]  Even French little guy is willing to send his troops to fight Russians.
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:20.008]  So why are they right now trying to show that they're humans, and they have the human-like feelings, saying, oh, we're so sorry, oh, poor Russian people, we're with you?
[01:15:21.329 --> 01:15:26.553]  A few months ago, they applauded to terrorist attacks in St.
[01:15:26.593 --> 01:15:35.119]  Pete, when one of prominent Russian journalists was killed, and a lot of people who attended this meeting with him were wounded.
[01:15:36.215 --> 01:15:45.599]  Every time when there's a terrorist attack done by the Ukrainians, West applauded, stating that Ukraine can do whatever they want to fight ugly Russia.
[01:15:46.359 --> 01:15:58.904]  But as of now, we see that behind this attack, not just Ukrainian special forces, but the real masters CIA and British special ops.
[01:15:59.571 --> 01:16:11.360]  That's right, and we saw Obama visit last week, and I said, my guest said, experts said, this is some big attack on Russia being planned, because Obama is really in control of ISIS as their cut-out group.
[01:16:11.921 --> 01:16:13.122]  Here's my concern, Vladimir.
[01:16:13.442 --> 01:16:17.505]  That's what Trump used to say, that Obama is father of ISIS.
[01:16:18.006 --> 01:16:19.807]  He's the guy who created ISIS.
[01:16:21.278 --> 01:16:23.839]  Those are exact words by the President Trump.
[01:16:24.099 --> 01:16:31.402]  We have Obama admitting, we'll play the clip in a moment Vladimir, but my concern is Putin has been very good at not escalating and not being tricked.
[01:16:31.822 --> 01:16:36.864]  He obviously had to after all the decade of attack to go on the special military operation.
[01:16:38.186 --> 01:16:48.191]  But this shows to me real desperation by the globalists, Anglo-American, British Intel, US Intel group that is waging war against us just like they're waging war against you.
[01:16:48.571 --> 01:16:49.671]  It's just more asymmetrical.
[01:16:50.252 --> 01:16:52.553]  My concern is it shows the hysteria.
[01:16:53.573 --> 01:16:58.275]  And how dangerous they are and the fact that they thought we would buy this.
[01:16:58.395 --> 01:16:59.856]  No one's buying this anywhere.
[01:17:00.276 --> 01:17:01.437]  It's blown up in their face.
[01:17:01.477 --> 01:17:04.798]  So my concern is Russia has won Ukraine.
[01:17:05.298 --> 01:17:06.299]  This is a desperation.
[01:17:06.319 --> 01:17:07.639]  I think we're going to see more of these.
[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:15.223]  Hopefully there isn't too much pressure on Putin to do anything to rash because this is a desperation move to try to get him to over respond.
[01:17:15.243 --> 01:17:15.983]  What do you think about that?
[01:17:17.952 --> 01:17:25.214]  First of all, nothing and no one can push Putin into making any form of unprepared decisions.
[01:17:25.254 --> 01:17:27.255]  He's a completely different type of person.
[01:17:28.215 --> 01:17:32.936]  Then, the election that we had in Russia was incredible.
[01:17:33.616 --> 01:17:38.998]  More Ukrainians bombarded Russian cities, more people went to vote.
[01:17:39.964 --> 01:17:46.105]  Saying that our vote count, amount of people that voted for Putin is unprecedented.
[01:17:46.225 --> 01:17:50.186]  So he has people mandate to do whatever he thinks is right.
[01:17:50.266 --> 01:17:51.246]  And what was the final number?
[01:17:51.266 --> 01:17:51.246]  86%?
[01:17:51.286 --> 01:17:51.726]  87%?
[01:17:51.306 --> 01:17:51.726]  What was it?
[01:17:51.746 --> 01:17:51.866]  It's 73%.
[01:17:51.966 --> 01:17:54.827]  Okay, so at first they said 80, 80 plus, now it's 70.
[01:17:54.867 --> 01:17:55.147]  No, no, no.
[01:17:54.967 --> 01:18:02.186]   73% okay so at first they said 80 80 plus now it's 70. No no no 73% of total
[01:18:02.186 --> 01:18:12.087]   voters who went to vote and 83.4% of those people voted for Putin. Got it.
[01:18:10.413 --> 01:18:12.034]  So huge, huge voter turnout.
[01:18:12.054 --> 01:18:14.175]  A million people, exactly.
[01:18:14.255 --> 01:18:20.599]  So it's more than 60% of registered voters gave the vote to Putin.
[01:18:20.779 --> 01:18:23.020]  Which shows people are upset to have a record turnout.
[01:18:24.881 --> 01:18:25.341]  Exactly.
[01:18:25.742 --> 01:18:34.046]  But what's important, American officials usually are saying that Russia is fighting the cruel war against Ukraine.
[01:18:35.015 --> 01:18:45.283]  Amount of civilians that were killed during this war in Ukraine is less than amount of military Ukrainian personnel.
[01:18:45.923 --> 01:18:47.324]  That's unprecedented.
[01:18:47.945 --> 01:18:57.632]  Never been in the history of wars when amount of civilians that unfortunately became victims of this war is much less than soldiers.
[01:18:58.773 --> 01:19:18.383]   In order for our American audience to just to keep it in mind, The total amount of Ukrainian civilians that were killed during the two-year aggression of Russia, as they say, is less than the amount of Palestinians that were killed by Israeli forces in two months!
[01:19:21.138 --> 01:19:26.303]  And this amount, official amount of Ukrainians that were killed is under 15,000.
[01:19:26.363 --> 01:19:29.466]  Vladimir, let me elaborate and see if I'm right about what you're saying.
[01:19:30.286 --> 01:19:34.430]  The Marines in Fallujah, a few Marines got hung off a bridge, it was terrible.
[01:19:34.911 --> 01:19:39.655]  The Marines just went in with artillery and flattened the whole city and killed 100,000 people, it's estimated.
[01:19:42.017 --> 01:19:45.819]  Your point is, if Russia wanted to, it's got huge artillery, probably the most in the world.
[01:19:45.839 --> 01:19:47.700]  You just roll in, level the whole place.
[01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:48.601]  We could destroy them all.
[01:19:48.621 --> 01:19:52.063]  You just go in grids, and then within two months, Ukraine's flattened.
[01:19:53.524 --> 01:19:54.424]  We don't do this.
[01:19:54.925 --> 01:19:57.386]  Look, you know, here's a huge attack on Kiev.
[01:19:57.826 --> 01:19:59.367]  How many civilians were killed?
[01:20:00.168 --> 01:20:00.668]  Zero.
[01:20:01.148 --> 01:20:03.890]  Well, the only civilians being hurt are when they shoot the missiles down.
[01:20:05.411 --> 01:20:05.931]  Exactly.
[01:20:07.612 --> 01:20:10.494]  And they're killed by the Ukrainian missiles.
[01:20:12.114 --> 01:20:13.415]  Well that's my concern.
[01:20:13.435 --> 01:20:27.888]  Remember when Zelensky got caught firing missiles into Poland and then claiming that it was Russians, but because the Poles shot them down, the tail numbers survived and it was Ukrainian missiles.
[01:20:27.988 --> 01:20:33.672]   I'm concerned More than a terror attack on Russia, which just happened, I'm concerned about Ukraine pulling false flags.
[01:20:33.712 --> 01:20:34.672]  Are you concerned about that?
[01:20:34.692 --> 01:20:35.573]  Because they're desperate.
[01:20:36.033 --> 01:20:36.773]  They always do.
[01:20:36.893 --> 01:20:37.854]  But that's one thing.
[01:20:37.914 --> 01:20:53.103]  Another thing is, total amount of NATO soldiers that were killed during 20 years in Afghanistan is less than amount of NATO citizens that were killed for two years in Russia, Ukrainian war.
[01:20:53.163 --> 01:20:53.783]  Six thousand.
[01:20:54.083 --> 01:20:55.864]  And NATO is not participating.
[01:20:56.024 --> 01:20:56.905]  Can you imagine that?
[01:20:57.617 --> 01:20:58.458]  Well, let's move to that.
[01:20:58.858 --> 01:21:03.961]  What do you make of Macron desperately, I think he's blackmailed, wanting to send in 20,000 troops.
[01:21:03.981 --> 01:21:05.781]  We know NATO troops are already there.
[01:21:06.282 --> 01:21:09.484]  We know they're getting killed, because I've talked to people in the military, been talking about it for years.
[01:21:10.204 --> 01:21:15.007]  What do you make of this schizophrenia in NATO, where, well, we're not going to send in troops, oh, we are.
[01:21:16.007 --> 01:21:17.728]  What do you make of these announcements?
[01:21:17.768 --> 01:21:20.289]  Well, first of all, they're already on the ground.
[01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:23.051]  But, you know, it's just a target.
[01:21:24.527 --> 01:21:26.068]  20,000?
[01:21:24.727 --> 01:21:26.068]  Okay.
[01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:34.913]  Since January 1st, 71,000 of Ukrainians were already killed during this war.
[01:21:35.473 --> 01:21:42.337]  So 20,000 French soldiers, it will take less than a month to destroy them all.
[01:21:43.157 --> 01:21:45.198]  And they will be just the target.
[01:21:45.418 --> 01:21:47.339]  We will have to kill them all.
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:50.637]   That's That's inevitable.
[01:21:50.817 --> 01:21:55.461]  That's what always happens with foreign soldiers that are trying to get on our ground.
[01:21:56.261 --> 01:21:57.622]  We're not going to Paris.
[01:21:58.183 --> 01:21:59.624]  They want to come to our land.
[01:22:00.344 --> 01:22:04.988]  But if they want to repeat the mistake of Napoleon, the result will be the same.
[01:22:06.269 --> 01:22:07.770]  That's so damn easy.
[01:22:08.291 --> 01:22:10.552]  They never learn historical lessons.
[01:22:11.413 --> 01:22:12.254]  That's too bad.
[01:22:12.614 --> 01:22:14.255]  Macron is willing to fight.
[01:22:14.275 --> 01:22:14.996]  I don't know why.
[01:22:15.908 --> 01:22:19.811]  He doesn't look like a person who is good in fighting, although he made this photo session.
[01:22:20.171 --> 01:22:24.054]  Oh, I noticed he puts out these videos where he's boxing and he's tough.
[01:22:24.074 --> 01:22:24.514]  Boxing?
[01:22:25.055 --> 01:22:26.796]  Oh yeah, he's boxing, yeah.
[01:22:26.876 --> 01:22:30.939]  Look, yet another Rocky Balboa, yeah, like Italian Stallion.
[01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:34.202]  He's not Italian, he's French and he's a lousy boxer.
[01:22:34.802 --> 01:22:37.004]  He is not a boxer at all, you know, so...
[01:22:38.170 --> 01:22:40.332]  All I know is, empires go to die.
[01:22:40.352 --> 01:22:41.854]  He is.
[01:22:41.874 --> 01:22:41.854]  100%.
[01:22:43.395 --> 01:22:44.276]  Married to a man, probably.
[01:22:45.197 --> 01:22:49.421]  He is literally... The French got their ass kicked in World War II.
[01:22:49.461 --> 01:22:50.161]  They got their ass kicked.
[01:22:50.181 --> 01:22:51.182]  They got saved by the Russians.
[01:22:51.643 --> 01:22:55.907]  They got their ass kicked by Napoleon, who was a major military leader.
[01:22:56.387 --> 01:22:57.388]  What are they thinking?
[01:22:57.448 --> 01:22:58.309]  Why don't they stop?
[01:23:00.387 --> 01:23:00.788]  I don't know.
[01:23:01.369 --> 01:23:02.390]  That's the best question.
[01:23:02.411 --> 01:23:08.921]  You know, French, Germans, they had perfect relationship with Russia for the last 10 years.
[01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:12.722]  And they cannot survive it.
[01:23:13.022 --> 01:23:14.123]  They destroyed it all.
[01:23:14.683 --> 01:23:17.905]  Germans allowed Americans to blow the North Pipe.
[01:23:18.366 --> 01:23:19.987]  And they're saying that, oh, that's okay.
[01:23:20.327 --> 01:23:22.529]  French guys are fighting not their war.
[01:23:23.129 --> 01:23:26.731]  But French soldiers are not willing to go and die for Macron.
[01:23:26.992 --> 01:23:33.556]  Already amount of French soldiers killed in Ukraine is more than amount of French soldiers that were killed in Afghanistan.
[01:23:33.956 --> 01:23:35.537]  And we haven't even started yet.
[01:23:36.138 --> 01:23:39.160]  They're making awful, awful, awful mistake.
[01:23:40.422 --> 01:23:42.683]  And I feel sorry for their wives and kids.
[01:23:43.724 --> 01:23:55.570]  My idea is, every time there will be yet another mercenary from the West killed in Ukraine, if we have his body, we'll give it back to the family in front of the embassies.
[01:23:56.557 --> 01:24:07.750]  In Russia, with all due respect, with all the national flags, but we'll tell the families, come and get the bodies of your sons and husbands.
[01:24:08.351 --> 01:24:09.853]  That's not our fault.
[01:24:10.333 --> 01:24:11.715]  Talk to your government.
[01:24:12.236 --> 01:24:13.938]  They are supporting Nazis.
[01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:19.415]  And that's why your sons are dying in Ukraine, not for the good cause.
[01:24:19.595 --> 01:24:21.737]  Vladimir Solyov, thank you.
[01:24:21.817 --> 01:24:22.257]  Stay there.
[01:24:22.277 --> 01:24:26.381]  I'm going to go to a quick break and I'm going to come back and ask you big picture in the world, U.S.
[01:24:26.822 --> 01:24:29.604]  election, Russia, where you see this going?
[01:24:29.624 --> 01:24:37.012]  Because I agree with you, the criminals that have hijacked our governments and are doing all this transgenderism and fentanyl deaths and selling us out are bad.
[01:24:38.069 --> 01:24:39.511]  But it's a paradox.
[01:24:39.651 --> 01:24:42.195]  Yeah, they're crazy losers, but they've got nuclear weapons.
[01:24:42.676 --> 01:24:44.819]  How do we come together to stop this?
[01:24:44.859 --> 01:24:45.561]  Please stay there.
[01:24:45.921 --> 01:24:47.083]  We're going to take a short break.
[01:24:47.323 --> 01:24:48.906]  We'll be right back in three minutes, sir.
[01:24:48.966 --> 01:25:12.164]  We'll be right back.
[01:25:12.191 --> 01:25:15.534]  He said we have a very good chance of sending The Great Reset on Amazon the number one.
[01:25:15.554 --> 01:25:17.875]  And if that happens, it'll make the book 20 times bigger.
[01:25:17.935 --> 01:25:18.536]  It's a great book.
[01:25:18.656 --> 01:25:20.317]  It's the blueprint of the New World Order and how to stop them.
[01:25:20.357 --> 01:25:21.378]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[01:25:21.618 --> 01:25:23.500]  And that would be a major funding boon for us.
[01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:24.941]  So it's like hitting the lottery.
[01:25:25.101 --> 01:25:28.523]  If it goes to number one, no matter what they do, it just magnifies.
[01:25:28.643 --> 01:25:29.924]  It's been as high as number six.
[01:25:30.085 --> 01:25:31.245]  It's number nine today.
[01:25:31.366 --> 01:25:35.008]  It's number one in more than 50 charts in the United States and the world right now.
[01:25:35.028 --> 01:25:36.469]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[01:25:37.210 --> 01:25:39.492]  Kindle, everything, the book, is now shipping as well.
[01:25:39.532 --> 01:25:41.393]  But I want you to get it at Amazon.com.
[01:25:41.453 --> 01:25:43.274]  I want you to buy copies for friends and family.
[01:25:43.334 --> 01:25:47.177]  We can send it to number one today, and now is the time to do it.
[01:25:47.237 --> 01:25:49.759]  And you gotta go look at the reviews that are pouring in.
[01:25:49.899 --> 01:25:51.600]  Currently today, it was number nine earlier.
[01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:52.881]  It's number 16 right now.
[01:25:54.542 --> 01:25:59.865]  But you look at it, where it's number one in best sellers in political corruption and misconduct.
[01:26:00.366 --> 01:26:02.007]  And the Kindle's number three.
[01:26:04.252 --> 01:26:06.274]  That's beating free books being put up by Obama.
[01:26:06.594 --> 01:26:09.477]  Best sellers in globalization, number one and number three.
[01:26:11.999 --> 01:26:15.302]  Best sellers in United States history, number one.
[01:26:15.442 --> 01:26:16.503]  Kindle, number six.
[01:26:16.703 --> 01:26:17.464]  And it goes on and on.
[01:26:17.684 --> 01:26:20.726]  You gotta go read the reviews.
[01:26:21.367 --> 01:26:22.868]  Number one in history.
[01:26:23.929 --> 01:26:24.630]  Think they like that?
[01:26:25.250 --> 01:26:26.652]  That's a major message to them.
[01:26:29.494 --> 01:26:30.195]  Number one.
[01:26:31.676 --> 01:26:33.257]  In bestsellers in media studies.
[01:26:33.637 --> 01:26:34.438]  Think they like that?
[01:26:36.059 --> 01:26:38.260]  Bestsellers in corruption and misconduct.
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:39.060]  Number one.
[01:26:40.261 --> 01:26:41.722]  Bestsellers in world history.
[01:26:41.782 --> 01:26:42.322]  Number one.
[01:26:42.962 --> 01:26:44.003]  And read the reviews.
[01:26:44.323 --> 01:26:45.904]  People are blown away.
[01:26:46.244 --> 01:26:48.165]  Five stars out the rear end.
[01:26:49.326 --> 01:26:51.007]  Thank you everybody for what you're doing.
[01:26:51.027 --> 01:26:51.907]  We're in this fight together.
[01:26:52.088 --> 01:26:55.730]  And this is a message that humanity wants the blueprint of the Death Star.
[01:26:56.130 --> 01:26:57.931]  Humanity wants to take on the New World Order.
[01:26:59.247 --> 01:27:02.029]  Alex Jones is right about far more than he's wrong about.
[01:27:02.329 --> 01:27:04.510]  He's the most misunderstood guy on the planet.
[01:27:04.570 --> 01:27:05.130]  Joe Rogan.
[01:27:06.511 --> 01:27:09.233]  And the quotes from Steve Bannon, Tucker Carlson, and others.
[01:27:10.493 --> 01:27:16.157]  If Alex Jones is just a crackpot, why are the most powerful people in the country trying to silence him?
[01:27:17.297 --> 01:27:20.099]  No one bothers to censor the Flat Earthers.
[01:27:20.139 --> 01:27:21.359]  Maybe Alex Jones is onto something.
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:23.861]  Read this book and decide for yourself who's crazy.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.801]  Get it today at Amazon.com.
[01:27:26.861 --> 01:27:27.921]  Drive it to number one.
[01:27:28.001 --> 01:27:34.863]  If all of you just simply go there and get your Christmas shopping out of the way and buy 5, 10 of these books, we'll get $3 or $4 a piece.
[01:27:34.963 --> 01:27:36.083]  That'll help keep us on air.
[01:27:36.363 --> 01:27:37.584]  And that's what you get as the author.
[01:27:37.684 --> 01:27:39.524]  You get a lot more, buy them at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:27:39.544 --> 01:27:41.605]  But I don't want you to get it at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[01:27:41.845 --> 01:27:45.666]  I want you to get it at Amazon.com to send that sucker to number one.
[01:27:45.686 --> 01:27:47.706]  And you have the power to do it right now.
[01:27:47.846 --> 01:27:48.787]  Go to Amazon.com.
[01:27:48.807 --> 01:27:51.908]  We'll put a big link in the live show feed right under the live show video.
[01:27:51.948 --> 01:27:52.528]  And it did go to number one.
[01:27:53.208 --> 01:27:59.371]  In fact, we'll put a whole big story at the very top that's saying, send The Great Reset and The War of the World to number one with a link to Amazon.
[01:27:59.471 --> 01:28:00.451]  Let's do it now.
[01:28:00.712 --> 01:28:01.792]  You won't fight the traffic.
[01:28:01.832 --> 01:28:02.973]  You won't battle all the crap.
[01:28:03.233 --> 01:28:04.973]  You won't deal with all the Christmas BS.
[01:28:05.014 --> 01:28:11.497]  You just buy 5, 10, 20 copies right now and send this sucker to number one.
[01:28:11.577 --> 01:28:12.397]  Turn it loose.
[01:28:12.657 --> 01:28:13.598]  It's an InfoWars.
[01:28:13.738 --> 01:28:16.439]  This is an exercise of your will and your power.
[01:28:16.679 --> 01:28:17.980]  It's going to number one.
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.180]  I believe in you.
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:20.861]  Go there now and get it.
[01:28:23.905 --> 01:28:25.186]  Oh, no, no, I don't even know what this is.
[01:28:25.226 --> 01:28:27.307]  How did you get here?
[01:28:27.327 --> 01:28:29.328]  I just caught you, American.
[01:28:29.628 --> 01:28:31.710]  You visited Bandar Video.
[01:28:32.610 --> 01:28:35.852]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[01:28:36.412 --> 01:28:41.995]  Do what CNN says and do not visit Bandar Video or I have to hurt you.
[01:28:42.136 --> 01:28:43.256]  Conflict.
[01:28:44.677 --> 01:28:46.677]  Kung-Fu.
[01:28:46.677 --> 01:28:49.677]  It comes from China.
[01:28:49.677 --> 01:29:07.677]   Vladimir Solyov is our guest, the biggest talk show host in Russia.
[01:29:07.677 --> 01:29:13.380]   I'm I am a pro-human individual and I don't want to start fights with anybody.
[01:29:14.201 --> 01:29:20.465]  And the very same globalists destroying my country are trying to go to nuclear war with Russia.
[01:29:20.565 --> 01:29:21.646]  That is insane!
[01:29:22.407 --> 01:29:24.669]  You know, I look at actuaries, I look at numbers, I'm a numbers guy.
[01:29:25.449 --> 01:29:29.472]  Until you're 50, I'm 50 now, the number one cause of death is automobile accidents.
[01:29:31.053 --> 01:29:37.444]   And I tell my wife, I tell the nanny, I've got four kids, three of them are grown up out of the house, but I've got a six-year-old.
[01:29:38.004 --> 01:29:45.247]  I say, you drive my daughter the minimum amount of where she needs to go, not a bunch of errands, because the car is the most dangerous thing.
[01:29:46.488 --> 01:29:48.469]  And when you're 50, it becomes heart attacks and cancer.
[01:29:49.129 --> 01:29:50.370]  Well, now I've looked at the numbers.
[01:29:50.410 --> 01:29:53.932]  The number one threat facing us is nuclear war with Russia.
[01:29:54.292 --> 01:29:56.133]  That's what threatens my family!
[01:29:58.086 --> 01:30:02.069]  Russia's full of resources, ready to do business with us, like Ron Paul said a decade ago.
[01:30:02.389 --> 01:30:03.630]  What the hell are we doing?
[01:30:05.471 --> 01:30:07.132]  This is bullfucking shit!
[01:30:08.713 --> 01:30:15.317]  And I hold the people responsible that are doing this, and they have done nothing but harass my family and terrorize me!
[01:30:15.598 --> 01:30:18.179]  And that hasn't made me be afraid!
[01:30:18.439 --> 01:30:21.221]  It's made me decide to go to war!
[01:30:22.482 --> 01:30:26.365]  We're taking our country back, and all this BS is gonna stop!
[01:30:27.455 --> 01:30:28.515]  And we're going to go to space!
[01:30:29.235 --> 01:30:30.016]  God damn it!
[01:30:30.976 --> 01:30:34.757]  We're going to do big things instead of have a bunch of jerks that think war's tough!
[01:30:34.957 --> 01:30:41.739]  And I look, but the neocons and the Democrats and the Republican leadership, they couldn't find their ass with both hands!
[01:30:42.019 --> 01:30:45.920]  They couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag because they've never been in a fight!
[01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:48.060]  And that's why they want to fight!
[01:30:48.881 --> 01:30:49.961]  Because they're punsies!
[01:30:52.284 --> 01:31:01.008]  And they brought in the sleeper cells, and they're getting ready to torch this country, think we're so dumb, we don't know they're on ISIS, and they just hit the Russians, and now they're all over the news, the Russians.
[01:31:01.549 --> 01:31:02.269]  Oh, they're gonna get us.
[01:31:02.669 --> 01:31:04.630]  Meanwhile, ISIS is back, they're gonna kill you.
[01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:07.972]  I am pissed, because we've never been in more danger.
[01:31:08.712 --> 01:31:13.514]  The number one threat to my children is nuclear war, and Russia isn't starting it.
[01:31:13.975 --> 01:31:24.178]   Criminals that hate America, CNN, ABC News, Hollywood, All they do is tell you how bad our families are, how bad our children are, how bad Christians are.
[01:31:24.438 --> 01:31:25.458]  It's not the Russians!
[01:31:25.858 --> 01:31:28.099]  If the Russians did any of this, I'd be their enemy!
[01:31:29.299 --> 01:31:29.839]  But they're not.
[01:31:29.859 --> 01:31:33.380]  Vladimir, I'm ranting here, but you've got the floor for the rest of the transmission.
[01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:39.421]  I know it's late in Russia, but I'm pissed because this is so- I actually admire every word you're saying.
[01:31:39.521 --> 01:31:41.061]  I think that you're absolutely right.
[01:31:41.221 --> 01:31:43.642]  The big question is, now, who's Biden?
[01:31:44.902 --> 01:31:45.642]  Is he in charge?
[01:31:46.528 --> 01:31:53.131]  Because if we look at what he's saying and what he's doing, the only question is, why is he willing to destroy America?
[01:31:53.771 --> 01:31:57.233]  Because he's shit scared what happens if he loses the election.
[01:31:58.013 --> 01:32:03.596]  He will have to go to jail with the whole team, and not because of Russia, because of corruption.
[01:32:04.276 --> 01:32:10.679]  And he understands pretty well that Trump won't give him even one single chance not to go to jail.
[01:32:11.389 --> 01:32:17.554]  And that's why, for the purpose of not being in jail, he will be able and he will be willing to destroy the whole world!
[01:32:18.555 --> 01:32:24.799]  Because the world has no meaning for him if he's not on the top of the mountain of power.
[01:32:25.380 --> 01:32:26.441]  If he's in jail.
[01:32:27.502 --> 01:32:31.485]  So, you're talking about a person who is old and not capable.
[01:32:32.245 --> 01:32:34.787]  And it's not a question of, you know, age.
[01:32:34.907 --> 01:32:36.849]  It's a question of his mental abilities.
[01:32:37.329 --> 01:32:38.410]  And who is scared.
[01:32:39.851 --> 01:32:44.984]   So, of course, when You have to deal with a person like Biden?
[01:32:45.464 --> 01:32:46.745]  You have to ask yourself a question.
[01:32:47.005 --> 01:32:48.667]  Is he the one who runs the show?
[01:32:49.888 --> 01:33:03.018]  Is this old, very weird, extremely dangerous and extremely angry with everyone man who is not capable of finding his way in and who is dying for his ice cream?
[01:33:03.619 --> 01:33:05.200]  And yet another day of vacation.
[01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:07.422]  Is he the one who runs the show?
[01:33:07.442 --> 01:33:18.928]   Or there is a team of corrupted Persons that are willing to kill everyone, like this poor guy who started telling the truth about Boeing.
[01:33:19.808 --> 01:33:29.190]  They're willing to kill everyone who is on the way of stealing money from American taxpayers.
[01:33:30.210 --> 01:33:34.431]  Why do you have to give 60 plus billion dollars to Ukraine?
[01:33:34.471 --> 01:33:34.911]  What for?
[01:33:36.272 --> 01:33:43.215]  What percentage of this money will go back to the pockets of Washington's corrupted elites?
[01:33:45.196 --> 01:33:49.198]  Why do you have to deal with Ukrainian Nazis right now?
[01:33:49.558 --> 01:33:50.298]  What's in it?
[01:33:50.519 --> 01:33:51.539]  What's in this Ukraine?
[01:33:51.559 --> 01:33:52.139]  Democracy?
[01:33:52.159 --> 01:33:53.280]  There is no democracy.
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:54.160]  Like, at all.
[01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:55.741]  No freedom of speech.
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:33:57.981]  No elections.
[01:33:58.001 --> 01:33:59.162]  Banning all the parties.
[01:33:59.222 --> 01:34:00.763]  Banning the Orthodox Church.
[01:34:00.843 --> 01:34:01.784]  Arresting priests.
[01:34:02.225 --> 01:34:02.825]  Exactly.
[01:34:03.586 --> 01:34:04.046]  Exactly.
[01:34:04.086 --> 01:34:05.527]  So this is not democracy.
[01:34:05.547 --> 01:34:06.648]  What democracy?
[01:34:07.329 --> 01:34:13.054]  As we have a joke in Russia, you know, democracy is when power is run by Democrats.
[01:34:13.154 --> 01:34:14.835]  Then when they call it democracy.
[01:34:15.256 --> 01:34:19.159]  If it's not when they are in charge, it's not democracy.
[01:34:19.199 --> 01:34:20.020]  It's tyranny.
[01:34:21.101 --> 01:34:22.402]  They're afraid of everything.
[01:34:23.576 --> 01:34:25.337]  They forgot about diplomacy.
[01:34:25.658 --> 01:34:26.959]  They don't want to hear Russia.
[01:34:27.079 --> 01:34:34.844]  It all started back in December 2021, when Putin said, come on guys, please keep your words.
[01:34:34.924 --> 01:34:40.188]  You told us that you will not make a step toward other borders, toward our borders.
[01:34:40.268 --> 01:34:41.729]  You said it 30 years ago.
[01:34:41.769 --> 01:34:44.271]  Since then, NATO expanded heavily.
[01:34:45.376 --> 01:34:49.937]  You're already on, not on our backyard, you're already in our bed!
[01:34:50.457 --> 01:34:53.218]  You're trying to rape our wives and kids!
[01:34:53.798 --> 01:34:54.318]  Stop it!
[01:34:54.458 --> 01:34:59.199]  Stop with LGBT plus, minus 92, 46, however you call it!
[01:34:59.259 --> 01:35:00.119]  Just stop it!
[01:35:00.199 --> 01:35:01.499]  We are not like you!
[01:35:02.620 --> 01:35:03.640]  We love God!
[01:35:04.140 --> 01:35:05.380]  We love our culture!
[01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:06.661]  We love our tradition!
[01:35:06.721 --> 01:35:09.201]  We're not telling you how to live your life!
[01:35:09.261 --> 01:35:11.102]  Don't tell us how to live our life!
[01:35:12.122 --> 01:35:13.162]  That's the only thing!
[01:35:14.452 --> 01:35:16.433]  Why do you have to fight Russia?
[01:35:16.713 --> 01:35:17.353]  What's for?
[01:35:18.553 --> 01:35:25.395]  Through the whole history of the United States, you never ever had even one single threat from Russia.
[01:35:26.215 --> 01:35:29.236]  Russia helped you at the stage when you fought British.
[01:35:30.316 --> 01:35:31.236]  Russia helped you.
[01:35:31.396 --> 01:35:36.297]  Mark Twain used to write letters to Russians saying, thank you, thank you, thank you, Russia.
[01:35:37.278 --> 01:35:40.278]  But Americans invaded Russia back in 1920s.
[01:35:40.298 --> 01:35:40.839]  What for?
[01:35:44.605 --> 01:35:45.186]  What for?
[01:35:45.806 --> 01:35:47.208]  During the Second World War?
[01:35:48.409 --> 01:35:49.730]  By the way, Vladimir, stay there.
[01:35:49.770 --> 01:35:52.252]  People don't know that Lenin and all them were funded by the U.S.
[01:35:52.273 --> 01:35:52.993]  British Intelligence.
[01:35:53.454 --> 01:35:54.214]  You just raise that.
[01:35:54.435 --> 01:35:55.035]  Bring up that.
[01:35:57.578 --> 01:35:58.298]  Well, okay.
[01:35:58.719 --> 01:36:06.528]   So, back after the revolution, Americans decided that, no, no, we don't like it, so that doesn't look good.
[01:36:06.568 --> 01:36:11.071]  So, why don't we go and grab whatever part of Russia we can?
[01:36:11.671 --> 01:36:22.519]  And with Brits, with French and other guys, they started, you know, those little invasion groups on different seaports of Russia.
[01:36:23.179 --> 01:36:27.962]  And Americans went hunting Russians, trying to get whatever they can.
[01:36:28.963 --> 01:36:30.704]  They didn't succeed, should I say.
[01:36:30.864 --> 01:36:31.865]  We destroyed them all.
[01:36:32.685 --> 01:36:37.728]  But that's not the part of the history that is usually discussed.
[01:36:38.848 --> 01:36:41.450]  But in Vladivostok, we had Brits.
[01:36:41.650 --> 01:36:43.851]  In Murmansk, we had British.
[01:36:44.191 --> 01:36:45.872]  In Odessa, we had French.
[01:36:46.412 --> 01:36:49.334]  And they were trying to destroy Russia at all.
[01:36:50.379 --> 01:36:51.960]  Then, Soviet Union.
[01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:53.860]  And we loved Americans.
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:54.680]  30s.
[01:36:55.161 --> 01:36:57.681]  We purchased as many factories as we could.
[01:36:58.342 --> 01:37:03.903]  500,000 Americans during Great Depression went to work for gold in Russia.
[01:37:04.364 --> 01:37:06.084]  Made enormous amount of money.
[01:37:06.544 --> 01:37:07.124]  Came back.
[01:37:07.585 --> 01:37:16.347]  And Russia was saying, okay, Americans were willing to sign an agreement with you that we don't interfere with you, you do not interfere with our domestic policies.
[01:37:17.228 --> 01:37:17.928]  And it went well.
[01:37:18.977 --> 01:37:23.241]  But 1945, you have nuclear weapon.
[01:37:23.421 --> 01:37:27.605]  Immediately came up with a plan of destroying major Russian cities.
[01:37:28.005 --> 01:37:28.286]  Why?
[01:37:28.466 --> 01:37:30.748]  It's better to be dead than red.
[01:37:31.208 --> 01:37:34.031]  Why is it better to be dead than red?
[01:37:34.992 --> 01:37:38.174]  We're not willing you to change your color.
[01:37:38.715 --> 01:37:40.136]  Be whatever color you want.
[01:37:40.316 --> 01:37:41.678]  But Russia is not red now.
[01:37:41.738 --> 01:37:43.039]  How would you describe Russia right now?
[01:37:44.975 --> 01:37:49.818]  Russia is a great orthodox and Islamic country.
[01:37:50.858 --> 01:37:53.280]  We're the country of traditional values.
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:55.621]  We're telling only one thing.
[01:37:55.741 --> 01:37:59.263]  We are bear and we're living on our territory.
[01:37:59.963 --> 01:38:01.964]  So don't mess with the bear.
[01:38:02.605 --> 01:38:04.325]  If you want to be kangaroo, fine.
[01:38:04.686 --> 01:38:06.587]  We're not willing to go to Australia.
[01:38:07.227 --> 01:38:09.508]  We're not trying to invade United States.
[01:38:10.549 --> 01:38:12.330]  We're not trying to invade Europe.
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:17.263]  Yeah, people don't know how big Russia is.
[01:38:17.943 --> 01:38:19.304]  Russia's the biggest country in the world.
[01:38:19.364 --> 01:38:20.325]  You don't need more land.
[01:38:20.365 --> 01:38:20.946]  You've got everything.
[01:38:22.727 --> 01:38:23.988]  We don't need more land.
[01:38:24.148 --> 01:38:25.709]  We need security.
[01:38:26.289 --> 01:38:31.813]  We want to be sure that there's nothing in our borders that is a threat to us.
[01:38:32.834 --> 01:38:35.776]  We're not willing to fight NATO in Europe.
[01:38:37.747 --> 01:38:39.407]  500 million people.
[01:38:39.447 --> 01:38:39.987]  We have only 150.
[01:38:40.027 --> 01:38:43.428]  I was about to say, what about the claims, Vladimir?
[01:38:43.648 --> 01:38:49.149]  What about the claims by NATO and by Sweden joining NATO that Russia's going to invade any moment?
[01:38:50.169 --> 01:38:51.229]  Putin's... With what?
[01:38:51.850 --> 01:38:52.510]  It's all made up.
[01:38:52.530 --> 01:38:53.530]  We'll invade them.
[01:38:53.590 --> 01:38:54.150]  With what?
[01:38:54.730 --> 01:38:57.951]  We don't have enough soldiers in order to control this territory.
[01:38:57.971 --> 01:38:59.191]  We don't need this territory.
[01:38:59.571 --> 01:39:03.132]  There is, you know, 500 million people.
[01:39:04.412 --> 01:39:05.312]  Why do we need them?
[01:39:06.855 --> 01:39:07.716]  What's the purpose?
[01:39:08.276 --> 01:39:14.299]  With 150 million, how can you invade 500 million and control them?
[01:39:15.099 --> 01:39:15.620]  What for?
[01:39:15.980 --> 01:39:18.061]  What do they have in Europe that we don't have?
[01:39:19.702 --> 01:39:20.222]  Zero!
[01:39:21.783 --> 01:39:24.944]  There's nothing in Europe that will be of any interest to us.
[01:39:25.465 --> 01:39:26.505]  Natural resources?
[01:39:27.045 --> 01:39:29.807]  We have all the natural resources in the world that we need.
[01:39:31.207 --> 01:39:32.608]  Access to the sea?
[01:39:32.808 --> 01:39:34.129]  We have all the things we need!
[01:39:35.678 --> 01:39:38.039]  What is in Europe that we couldn't buy?
[01:39:38.059 --> 01:39:41.701]  My little villa at Lagos de Coma.
[01:39:41.961 --> 01:39:43.662]  They already sanctioned it.
[01:39:44.042 --> 01:39:46.783]  So even for this purpose, we don't have to fight them.
[01:39:47.143 --> 01:39:48.524]  It's already sanctioned.
[01:39:48.684 --> 01:39:50.105]  So Vladimir, let me ask you this.
[01:39:50.405 --> 01:39:53.526]  There's nothing in Europe that we will have to fight for.
[01:39:54.247 --> 01:39:56.368]  Let's look at worst case, best case scenarios.
[01:39:56.728 --> 01:39:57.788]  The globalists are deranged.
[01:39:57.808 --> 01:39:58.689]  They're out of control.
[01:39:59.049 --> 01:40:00.190]  They've dissolved our borders.
[01:40:00.210 --> 01:40:01.310]  They're waging war against us.
[01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:02.391]  Believe me, we know they're bad.
[01:40:02.771 --> 01:40:04.772]  It's an outside group running America, running Europe.
[01:40:05.692 --> 01:40:07.353]  Best case scenario, worst case scenario.
[01:40:07.853 --> 01:40:09.114]  They've shown how crazy they are.
[01:40:09.214 --> 01:40:13.176]  What are you guys really concerned about now that you've absolutely won in Ukraine?
[01:40:13.556 --> 01:40:15.217]  It's clear the world's on your side.
[01:40:15.577 --> 01:40:17.258]  What are they going to do next because they don't give up?
[01:40:18.759 --> 01:40:20.680]  They don't have many chances.
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:24.282]  First of all, I think that will be a lot of problems inside Europe.
[01:40:26.123 --> 01:40:29.305]  Currently, this will lose whatever elections they have to have.
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:36.865]  Because people of Europe are not willing to spend an enormous amount of money on the war that they do not understand what the purpose is.
[01:40:37.706 --> 01:40:38.847]  So that's the big problem.
[01:40:38.907 --> 01:40:43.711]  That's why they're trying to solve their domestic problems with yet another war.
[01:40:44.231 --> 01:40:55.000]  But this war won't lead them anywhere, because on every tank that we produce, on every artillery shell that we produce, we produce it more cost-effectively than Europe or America.
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:59.063]  So in this arms race, no one can beat us.
[01:41:00.169 --> 01:41:04.230]  We're times better, because we have real economy, industrial time.
[01:41:04.270 --> 01:41:07.672]  That's right, Russia produces seven artillery shells.
[01:41:07.972 --> 01:41:11.593]  Russia produces seven artillery shells for every one produced by the West.
[01:41:13.894 --> 01:41:20.336]  I think that it's a much worse scenario than that for the European states.
[01:41:20.416 --> 01:41:22.957]  I think that we produce more and better.
[01:41:23.797 --> 01:41:27.559]  And we come up with enormous amount of great new military ideas.
[01:41:27.619 --> 01:41:34.388]   But in our concept, We don't have preventive use of nuclear weapons.
[01:41:35.409 --> 01:41:39.051]  We do not start war with nuclear attacks.
[01:41:39.091 --> 01:41:39.492]  We have a doctrine.
[01:41:39.332 --> 01:41:43.612]   Let's talk about, I'll stop you, I'll stop you, you start over I'm gonna shut up.
[01:41:43.612 --> 01:41:45.771]  Nuclear war, what is the Russian view on that?
[01:41:45.771 --> 01:41:48.731]   Putin's saying we don't want nuclear war but it's on the table.
[01:41:48.731 --> 01:41:51.612]  Sean Penn says go ahead and use them.
[01:41:51.612 --> 01:41:54.652]  It's just a nuclear war.
[01:41:54.652 --> 01:42:02.992]   We have a doctrine, in our military doctrine, we cannot use nuclear weapon just because
[01:42:03.683 --> 01:42:07.665]  There is not a preliminary way of using nuclear weapon.
[01:42:08.205 --> 01:42:10.486]  In American doctrine, there is.
[01:42:10.687 --> 01:42:19.590]  In Russian doctrine, we can use nuclear war only after someone is using it against us or create yet another vital danger.
[01:42:19.610 --> 01:42:20.551]  By the way, that's true.
[01:42:20.811 --> 01:42:22.132]  That's true.
[01:42:22.172 --> 01:42:22.932]  Everything you say is a lie.
[01:42:22.952 --> 01:42:23.272]  It's true.
[01:42:23.832 --> 01:42:27.214]  US policy 20 years ago changed to preemptive nuclear war.
[01:42:27.274 --> 01:42:29.575]  Russia has a law against using nukes first.
[01:42:32.125 --> 01:42:33.405]  We won't use nukes first.
[01:42:33.886 --> 01:42:34.506]  We don't need it.
[01:42:35.246 --> 01:42:40.308]  We have an enormous amount of heavy weapons that can do even worse damage.
[01:42:40.928 --> 01:42:46.590]  Right now, we're using those flying bombs, you know.
[01:42:46.650 --> 01:42:48.150]  Glidebombs.
[01:42:48.310 --> 01:42:48.810]  Glidebombs.
[01:42:48.830 --> 01:42:49.671]  Yeah, flybombs.
[01:42:50.071 --> 01:42:51.071]  Cruise missiles.
[01:42:52.171 --> 01:42:54.512]  Yeah, no, they're not cruise missiles.
[01:42:54.552 --> 01:42:55.612]  They're actually bombs.
[01:42:55.892 --> 01:42:56.413]  Glidebombs.
[01:42:56.533 --> 01:42:58.033]  But we told them to dance.
[01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:10.707]  So now they know how to fly, they know how to fly exactly to the target on the ground with, you know, so now it's very precise type of weapon.
[01:43:11.348 --> 01:43:20.335]  And when something like this hits the ground, we started with 500 kilos and now we have 3000 kilos bomb.
[01:43:21.135 --> 01:43:22.877]  The damage is devastating.
[01:43:24.011 --> 01:43:25.231]  It just devastates.
[01:43:25.291 --> 01:43:27.352]  And it applies exactly to the target.
[01:43:27.372 --> 01:43:29.552]  That was my next question, but I want you to elaborate on nuclear war.
[01:43:29.572 --> 01:43:30.952]  I want you to elaborate on nuclear war.
[01:43:31.032 --> 01:43:32.193]  I want you to go here.
[01:43:32.273 --> 01:43:32.833]  Just take over.
[01:43:33.233 --> 01:43:41.474]  But since you mentioned that... The only person who can start the nuclear war is Sleepy Biden.
[01:43:41.494 --> 01:43:49.116]  He's the only person that can, unfortunately, and he will use the nuclear weapon.
[01:43:49.736 --> 01:43:51.296]  It won't be against Russia.
[01:43:52.373 --> 01:43:56.456]  I would say that he will try to use it against Iran.
[01:43:57.156 --> 01:44:03.240]  Maybe he will be using it, not by Americans, but through Israeli sources.
[01:44:04.341 --> 01:44:06.723]  But that is an option, unfortunately.
[01:44:07.143 --> 01:44:09.364]  And that will be the end of the world as we know it.
[01:44:09.424 --> 01:44:14.568]  Because after that, no one will ever stop using nuclear bombs.
[01:44:14.628 --> 01:44:20.249]   They will start with tactical And then it's very fast we'll go to strategic type of nuclear device.
[01:44:20.289 --> 01:44:21.269]  Vladimir, I totally agree.
[01:44:21.309 --> 01:44:22.090]  So elaborate on that.
[01:44:22.790 --> 01:44:28.553]  The way the globalists will end one failed war is a new war with Israeli stand down and Hamas and all of that.
[01:44:28.573 --> 01:44:29.513]  I agree.
[01:44:29.553 --> 01:44:31.955]  They're now moving away from Russia to Iran.
[01:44:31.995 --> 01:44:32.595]  That's a great point.
[01:44:32.615 --> 01:44:33.215]  Elaborate on that.
[01:44:35.937 --> 01:44:38.418]  They cannot hit Russia because Russia will hit back.
[01:44:38.886 --> 01:44:45.268]  But right now, the major problem of the current American administration is that they have zero respect.
[01:44:45.908 --> 01:44:48.329]  And they don't know how to get this respect back.
[01:44:48.889 --> 01:44:51.030]  Because the Blinken team is useless.
[01:44:51.190 --> 01:44:55.031]  In the Arab world, they're just a bad joke.
[01:44:55.431 --> 01:45:03.234]  So they will fight hard in order to get back, not respect, but at least the scariness of the Arab world.
[01:45:03.594 --> 01:45:06.455]  And the Islamic world, because the Iranians are not Arabs.
[01:45:07.196 --> 01:45:11.118]  So that's why they cannot fight Houthi, Ayan Sarala.
[01:45:11.558 --> 01:45:13.539]  They don't know what to do with Hezbollah.
[01:45:14.039 --> 01:45:15.820]  They don't know what to do with Hamas.
[01:45:16.861 --> 01:45:23.684]  The total budget of those guys is nothing comparing with the military budget of Israel.
[01:45:24.284 --> 01:45:26.245]  And Israel cannot win this war.
[01:45:27.834 --> 01:45:35.620]  Americans are not willing to fight for Israelis, but they cannot allow themselves not to fight for Israelis.
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:47.409]  Because in any other case scenario, Israelis will create hell for Biden on his ground, on his soil, through mass media that sympathize Israelis.
[01:45:48.390 --> 01:45:49.551]  And that's a huge problem.
[01:45:50.172 --> 01:45:53.374]  So Biden has to decide what's good for the American people.
[01:45:54.695 --> 01:46:02.102]   Yet another war Or concentration on domestic problems that he has no idea how to solve.
[01:46:02.302 --> 01:46:03.403]  Let me ask you this.
[01:46:03.483 --> 01:46:05.785]  His team will fight Iran.
[01:46:05.965 --> 01:46:06.866]  We appreciate your time.
[01:46:07.126 --> 01:46:08.447]  In closing, we really appreciate your time.
[01:46:08.787 --> 01:46:09.528]  It's great to come on your show.
[01:46:09.548 --> 01:46:10.308]  I'd love to come back on.
[01:46:10.328 --> 01:46:14.452]  I want to stop World War III and we have solidarity for the future for all our children.
[01:46:14.912 --> 01:46:15.372]  You're a father.
[01:46:15.392 --> 01:46:16.193]  I'm a father as well.
[01:46:17.534 --> 01:46:17.854]  Israel.
[01:46:18.295 --> 01:46:19.235]  I'm not anti-Semitic.
[01:46:19.556 --> 01:46:21.017]  I know Israel's a diverse group of people.
[01:46:21.097 --> 01:46:21.938]  I'm not against Israel.
[01:46:23.649 --> 01:46:33.737]  You have Israel stand down on October 7th, and then you have them now carpet bombing and doing all of this and genociding people, and it turns the whole world against them.
[01:46:33.777 --> 01:46:37.560]  And the Israeli spokesman said two days ago, we don't care if the whole world turns against us.
[01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:39.322]  Well, they already have.
[01:46:39.802 --> 01:46:40.462]  You're Jewish.
[01:46:40.563 --> 01:46:44.686]  I'm asking you, what do you think the calculus is in all of this for what Israel's doing?
[01:46:46.852 --> 01:46:52.034]  Well, that's one of the hardest questions that I had to explain to my friends in Russia.
[01:46:52.514 --> 01:46:57.095]  Not Israelis, not all Israelis are Jewish, and not all Jews are Israelis.
[01:46:59.036 --> 01:47:08.118]  As far as I'm concerned, it doesn't matter what religion, what color, or what nationality is the kid that is killed.
[01:47:09.099 --> 01:47:13.160]  You cannot allow yourself to kill women and children.
[01:47:13.540 --> 01:47:14.300]  That is wrong!
[01:47:15.141 --> 01:47:20.668]   And when Israelis Saying that, oh, the whole nation should be White Ops.
[01:47:20.728 --> 01:47:21.989]  That's our sacred war.
[01:47:22.089 --> 01:47:22.970]  It's insane!
[01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:30.835]  We cannot do the same thing to Palestinians as Nazis were doing to us during the Second World War.
[01:47:31.556 --> 01:47:33.077]  That is not our way.
[01:47:33.537 --> 01:47:34.037]  Exactly.
[01:47:34.097 --> 01:47:35.718]  So why is Israel losing that?
[01:47:35.778 --> 01:47:37.860]  Why are they purposely destroying the high ground?
[01:47:39.486 --> 01:47:44.087]  I think that it's done by Bibi, who is fighting his own political future.
[01:47:44.107 --> 01:47:49.589]  And that's why there are a lot of people in Israel that are saying that, come on guys, what are we doing?
[01:47:50.209 --> 01:47:51.309]  How did we get there?
[01:47:51.329 --> 01:48:03.032]  And that's why there are a lot of people inside Israel that, of course, and one thing for sure, the terrorist attack against Israelis was awful, devastating act of terrorism.
[01:48:03.452 --> 01:48:06.313]  And every single terrorist should be destroyed!
[01:48:07.077 --> 01:48:09.018]  But they should show restraint!
[01:48:09.078 --> 01:48:10.559]  They should show restraint like Putin!
[01:48:12.179 --> 01:48:12.719]  Exactly!
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:19.422]  If you want to kill all the terrorists, why do you have to destroy whatever is around and not destroy the terrorists?
[01:48:19.843 --> 01:48:21.403]  You wanted to free hostages!
[01:48:21.983 --> 01:48:23.284]  Where are the hostages?
[01:48:23.404 --> 01:48:26.665]  Why they're not with the families?
[01:48:26.886 --> 01:48:32.408]  How come that you put the main goal, I will come and free every single hostage?
[01:48:33.593 --> 01:48:34.054]  You didn't.
[01:48:34.655 --> 01:48:36.478]  I will go and kill all the Hamas.
[01:48:36.658 --> 01:48:37.139]  You didn't.
[01:48:37.339 --> 01:48:38.120]  You killed women.
[01:48:38.801 --> 01:48:39.602]  You killed kids.
[01:48:40.083 --> 01:48:42.767]  Maybe a few Hamas fighters, but Hamas is still there.
[01:48:43.569 --> 01:48:46.353]  But what you actually completely destroyed.
[01:48:47.401 --> 01:48:50.002]  It's support for Jewish people around the world.
[01:48:50.363 --> 01:48:52.584]  And that is devastating.
[01:48:52.644 --> 01:48:54.185]  I totally agree.
[01:48:54.385 --> 01:48:55.465]  Because I'm not anti-Israel.
[01:48:55.525 --> 01:48:56.606]  I see Israel destroying itself.
[01:48:57.106 --> 01:48:58.487]  I'm being accused of being anti-Israel.
[01:48:58.547 --> 01:48:59.847]  I don't believe Israel should be destroyed.
[01:48:59.867 --> 01:49:01.768]  They have nuclear weapons.
[01:49:01.808 --> 01:49:04.690]  Even though I hated Israel, which I don't, they're not going to go away unless there's a nuclear war.
[01:49:04.710 --> 01:49:06.851]  It's another trigger that threatens us all.
[01:49:09.341 --> 01:49:15.044]  I wanted to bring up, just for a few minutes Vladimir if you have the time, Jack Masovic, former Naval Intelligence, dialed in to U.S.
[01:49:15.104 --> 01:49:21.127]  Intel, great guy, predicted dozens of times the last six months, terror attacks on Russia.
[01:49:21.147 --> 01:49:25.430]  I want him to be able to address us and also talk to you as soon as you leave.
[01:49:25.450 --> 01:49:28.852]  Michael Yeun and his co-hosts are going to come on, we're going to continue into the next hour.
[01:49:29.572 --> 01:49:32.654]  But Jack, we're here with the top Russian talk show host.
[01:49:33.915 --> 01:49:39.683]  Number one talk show host right now, so great opportunity for us to be talking to Vladimir and, you know, have you here.
[01:49:39.723 --> 01:49:44.490]  Give us your quick, I know you have to go, snapshot of this and any questions or comments for Vladimir.
[01:49:46.038 --> 01:49:55.326]  Well yes, first of all, I'd like to express condolences to all the victims of the attack, to the people of Moscow, people of Russia, who suffered in this, and their families.
[01:49:55.566 --> 01:50:25.601]   This horrific attack on civilians, and the same types of attacks that we're going to condemn these around the world, and the entire world should stand against this type of attack, and that's why When I look at the type of things that the United States government has been funding, the type of statements that have been made by people like Victoria Nuland and others, who several weeks ago, Alex and I ran an entire segment, an entire special report, where we said that Victoria Nuland was calling for these types of attacks in Russia.
[01:50:25.901 --> 01:50:32.324]   We said that these people like Putin that were getting into power and the intelligence services in Ukraine Guys, thank you for being there.
[01:50:32.163 --> 01:50:35.884]   sorts of attacks I specifically Jack I know you're there your kids soccer
[01:50:35.884 --> 01:50:39.243]   practice we're gonna write back to you but Vladimir's got to go so go right
[01:50:39.243 --> 01:50:42.363]   back to you in two minutes Vladimir thank you for the time tonight I want to
[01:50:42.363 --> 01:50:44.943]   hear from Jack so but thank you gentlemen but but you've got to go
[01:50:44.943 --> 01:50:50.702]   closing comment Vladimir guys thank you for being there because of
[01:50:50.702 --> 01:50:57.123]   your work here in Russia we understand that America is not over yet that there
[01:50:57.123 --> 01:51:02.342]   are people in the United States that love America and want America to be
[01:51:02.342 --> 01:51:05.926]   great again Well, thank you, Vladimir.
[01:51:06.447 --> 01:51:10.889]  And so I'm glad you know that the majority of Americans you've seen in the polls are against war with Russia.
[01:51:10.909 --> 01:51:11.970]  I'm glad the Russians know that.
[01:51:15.252 --> 01:51:15.972]  Have a great show.
[01:51:16.192 --> 01:51:16.913]  Thank you so much.
[01:51:17.013 --> 01:51:18.294]  All right, back to you, Jack Masovic.
[01:51:18.574 --> 01:51:24.477]  Jack, continue your amazing analysis, because you nailed this, and this shows desperation by the deep state.
[01:51:24.497 --> 01:51:25.738]  What do you expect is going to come next?
[01:51:27.449 --> 01:51:28.409]  Alex, it's very clear.
[01:51:28.669 --> 01:51:29.670]  And we've got the book.
[01:51:29.710 --> 01:51:31.330]  We put it all together on humans.
[01:51:31.390 --> 01:51:32.411]  It's coming out very soon.
[01:51:32.451 --> 01:51:35.792]  People are already trying to cancel this thing off of Amazon because we've got their playbook.
[01:51:35.832 --> 01:51:39.873]  We put it all together for the first time in this election.
[01:51:39.893 --> 01:51:41.633]  It's up on Amazon where people can go.
[01:51:41.693 --> 01:51:42.574]  It's already in the top 100.
[01:51:42.634 --> 01:51:44.354]  It's making people very, very upset.
[01:51:44.374 --> 01:51:45.395]  It's very simple, Alex.
[01:51:45.735 --> 01:51:55.178]  There is a small group of people that is trying to foment a full war between the United States and NATO forces, so the U.S.
[01:51:55.198 --> 01:51:56.358]  and NATO, the collective West.
[01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:07.725]  Well, there's a word for that, Alex.
[01:52:07.885 --> 01:52:10.086]  It's called World War Three.
[01:52:10.466 --> 01:52:14.048]  And when I put the title of my book, Unhumans, people got very upset.
[01:52:14.128 --> 01:52:15.089]  They said, you shouldn't do this.
[01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:16.890]  And I would say, what would you call?
[01:52:17.330 --> 01:52:19.812]  What would you call people who stand against humanity?
[01:52:20.212 --> 01:52:21.773]  What would you call the type of people?
[01:52:22.253 --> 01:52:23.213]  No, I agree.
[01:52:23.293 --> 01:52:26.395]  What's the opposite of Team Humanity, Jack?
[01:52:26.415 --> 01:52:27.035]  It's un-humans.
[01:52:28.375 --> 01:52:29.536]  It's Team Humanity, Alex.
[01:52:29.556 --> 01:52:38.839]  Just like you and I spoke about with Elon a couple of months ago on that X-Spaces, I said, if you are Team Humanity, then you must stand against Team Un-Humanity.
[01:52:39.139 --> 01:52:43.040]  And if you're for Team Un-Humanity, that doesn't mean you agree with everything that everybody says or does all the time.
[01:52:43.319 --> 01:52:47.119]   That doesn't mean you're always gonna be agreeing on how people run their countries or how people,
[01:52:47.119 --> 01:52:50.639]   you know, what religions people have and different things like that.
[01:52:50.639 --> 01:52:52.158]  Understood, got it, right?
[01:52:52.158 --> 01:52:55.880]   I'm a devout Christian, I'm a Catholic, I raised my kids that way.
[01:52:55.880 --> 01:53:02.158]   But at the same time, we have to understand that we have a very fragile world that we all live on
[01:53:02.158 --> 01:53:03.998]  and it could be destroyed.
[01:53:03.998 --> 01:53:11.319]   And unfortunately, there is a small group of people that is trying to destroy everything that we hold dear,
[01:53:11.319 --> 01:53:12.599]  all of our families.
[01:53:12.658 --> 01:53:21.761]  And so if you're worried about, you know, whatever, whatever your pet issue is, whatever you're worried about, it doesn't matter a hill of beans when those nuclear missiles start flying.
[01:53:22.021 --> 01:53:25.783]  And so people need to wake up and understand what it is that we're against.
[01:53:26.043 --> 01:53:29.104]  We must start embracing reciprocity.
[01:53:29.484 --> 01:53:33.285]  Reciprocity is the key word and the key phrase through on humans.
[01:53:33.305 --> 01:53:37.465]   We walk through the great men of history who have fought against these forces in the past,
[01:53:37.465 --> 01:53:41.265]   the great men of history who have stood up and stood against this, the people of means,
[01:53:41.265 --> 01:53:45.025]   and we talk about the people who are standing up against it today.
[01:53:45.025 --> 01:53:46.025]  This is what's very clear, Alex.
[01:53:46.025 --> 01:53:50.945]   We need networks, we need human networks to join together in the real world.
[01:53:50.945 --> 01:53:55.385]   We need people to start building infrastructure, making those connections.
[01:53:55.428 --> 01:53:57.590]  All these people that say, where's the nuclear war?
[01:53:58.111 --> 01:53:59.191]  We've been holding it off.
[01:53:59.212 --> 01:54:00.953]  They need to know how close it is.
[01:54:01.013 --> 01:54:03.175]  So this signifies the Globals are desperate.
[01:54:03.655 --> 01:54:09.420]  You predicted this six months ago, five months ago, two months ago, a month ago, two weeks ago, on March 5th on the show.
[01:54:09.781 --> 01:54:11.863]  What are you predicting comes next, Jack Posobiec?
[01:54:11.883 --> 01:54:14.385]  We'll let you get back to your children's sports.
[01:54:14.665 --> 01:54:20.707]  Look, the issue is that Russia hasn't taken the bait yet.
[01:54:21.127 --> 01:54:32.271]  They want Russia to roll into Western Ukraine, to roll into Transnistria, to roll into a NATO neighbor, whether it's Finland or whether it's Poland, one of the Baltic states.
[01:54:32.571 --> 01:54:35.292]  And so that's why these provocations are going.
[01:54:36.312 --> 01:54:38.693]  And unfortunately, Alex, this isn't going to be the last one.
[01:54:39.272 --> 01:54:40.836]  This isn't going to be the last one.
[01:54:40.856 --> 01:54:43.261]  This is going to be the first of a new... That's right.
[01:54:43.281 --> 01:54:46.588]  The State Department says brace for more... The State Department says brace for more attacks.
[01:54:47.645 --> 01:54:49.086]  I haven't even seen that.
[01:54:49.266 --> 01:55:01.135]  So this is Operation Gladio 2.0, and people need to understand that it is now kicked off, it is now commenced, we are in the midst of Operation Gladio 2.0, and it is not going to stop until the people behind it are stopped.
[01:55:01.416 --> 01:55:08.161]  That's the clear thing, and Alex, when we went through the history of all of these different things, this is an irregular communist revolution that we are living through.
[01:55:08.201 --> 01:55:14.746]  The globalists are behind it now, and what we found is that these people will not stop until they are stopped.
[01:55:15.286 --> 01:55:21.151]  If you think the live and let live, and I know I've got a lot of friends who are libertarians out there that say, hey, live and let live, don't tread on me, man.
[01:55:21.171 --> 01:55:22.411]  I was going to go do my thing.
[01:55:22.632 --> 01:55:23.873]  You think they won't come for you?
[01:55:24.213 --> 01:55:25.814]  You think they won't come for your families?
[01:55:25.854 --> 01:55:27.235]  You think they won't come for the children?
[01:55:27.295 --> 01:55:28.776]  Oh, they're arming the illegal aliens.
[01:55:28.976 --> 01:55:29.537]  This is it.
[01:55:29.757 --> 01:55:31.038]  This ain't a joke, people.
[01:55:31.098 --> 01:55:31.918]  It's going down.
[01:55:31.938 --> 01:55:34.100]  Armed invasion of our border.
[01:55:34.220 --> 01:55:35.221]  Go ask the family.
[01:55:36.161 --> 01:55:39.003]  Go ask the family of Lake and Riley if they got left alone.
[01:55:39.344 --> 01:55:44.768]  Go ask the families of any of the angel mom, the angel families out there, if they feel like they were left alone.
[01:55:45.088 --> 01:55:47.150]  No, there's there's no alone anymore.
[01:55:47.230 --> 01:55:48.451]  Now is the time for action.
[01:55:48.511 --> 01:55:49.652]  Now is the time to get active.
[01:55:49.712 --> 01:55:52.474]  Now is the time to make connections like you're doing, Alex.
[01:55:52.814 --> 01:56:02.162]  Making connections, getting outside of your box, reaching out to people in different countries, in different places, whether it's Elon, whether it's reaching out to people that are all on different parts of the spectrum.
[01:56:02.942 --> 01:56:03.983]  The political spectrum.
[01:56:04.023 --> 01:56:05.124]  It doesn't matter anymore.
[01:56:05.144 --> 01:56:08.347]  It's Team Humanity versus Team Unhumanity.
[01:56:08.407 --> 01:56:09.228]  It's as simple as that.
[01:56:09.248 --> 01:56:10.409]  Alright, Jack.
[01:56:10.449 --> 01:56:11.850]  How do people find your great analysis?
[01:56:13.311 --> 01:56:15.333]  Yeah, the book is Unhumans.
[01:56:15.553 --> 01:56:16.934]  It's currently on Amazon.
[01:56:17.094 --> 01:56:19.817]  Everywhere people buy books, you can go get it.
[01:56:19.857 --> 01:56:22.579]  People are already trying to ban this book from all sides.
[01:56:22.599 --> 01:56:24.601]  We want to send this to number one.
[01:56:24.661 --> 01:56:25.502]  Can't wait to read it.
[01:56:26.274 --> 01:56:27.495]  Let's send it to number one.
[01:56:27.555 --> 01:56:30.859]  We've got the special police legislative council.
[01:56:30.899 --> 01:56:31.559]  The S.P.L.C.
[01:56:31.599 --> 01:56:32.540]  is attacking this book.
[01:56:32.841 --> 01:56:36.004]  You've got people who are like moderates attacking this book.
[01:56:36.444 --> 01:56:36.985]  It's just a book.
[01:56:37.165 --> 01:56:38.166]  You can get it if you want.
[01:56:38.546 --> 01:56:39.727]  It's got the tools in there.
[01:56:39.828 --> 01:56:43.992]  And we go through all the way back to the Roman Revolution, the Roman Civil War.
[01:56:44.392 --> 01:57:02.465]  The Julius Caesar stopped, to the French Revolution, to the Russians, to Mao, to all the way up to today, and we break through in a systemized manner how these people operate, the type of options that they use to foment their revolutions, the incitement, and there's three stages.
[01:57:02.485 --> 01:57:04.507]  There's always three stages of a pre-revolution.
[01:57:04.787 --> 01:57:07.308]  You are currently in the incitement stage.
[01:57:07.728 --> 01:57:14.052]  If you take the bait in the incitement stage, then they move on to the seizing and then they move on to the purges.
[01:57:14.552 --> 01:57:16.333]  Incite, seize, purge.
[01:57:16.593 --> 01:57:17.473]  That is what they do.
[01:57:17.773 --> 01:57:18.814]  This is what they do.
[01:57:18.874 --> 01:57:20.675]  This is what they always do.
[01:57:20.935 --> 01:57:22.336]  We can stop it at key points.
[01:57:22.556 --> 01:57:24.557]  That's what we lay through in the book.
[01:57:24.877 --> 01:57:30.580]  The key node to stopping all of this that people have to understand in these, because we're now in a regular warfare.
[01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:31.840]  This is a fifth generation warfare.
[01:57:31.860 --> 01:57:38.413]   This isn't the Russian Civil War, not the Chinese No, this is 5GW Irregular Communist Warfare that we're facing right now.
[01:57:38.814 --> 01:57:39.616]  Unhumans is the book.
[01:57:39.636 --> 01:57:40.298]  You need to read this.
[01:57:40.338 --> 01:57:41.641]  Run by BlackRock of the New World Order.
[01:57:41.661 --> 01:57:42.403]  Thank you, Jack Masala.
[01:57:42.423 --> 01:57:43.044]  Get back to your family.
[01:57:43.770 --> 01:57:44.770]  God bless, Alex.
[01:57:44.770 --> 01:57:45.770]  All right.
[01:57:45.770 --> 01:57:49.770]   I appreciate Michael Yon, his great co-host, and Vander Steele holding 20 minutes while
[01:57:49.770 --> 01:57:51.770]  we got behind here with our guests.
[01:57:51.770 --> 01:57:57.490]   I'm trying to give you both the floor because you've gotten the main CHICOM base on the
[01:57:57.490 --> 01:58:01.690]   South American-Central American border with Panama shut down.
[01:58:01.690 --> 01:58:02.850]  That's huge news.
[01:58:02.850 --> 01:58:04.329]  We have massive invasions.
[01:58:04.329 --> 01:58:07.770]   We have Islamists being taken in, just like we just saw in Russia.
[01:58:07.770 --> 01:58:09.210]  What is the master plan?
[01:58:09.210 --> 01:58:12.690]   Michael Yon and Vander Steele, you guys have the floor right now.
[01:58:12.690 --> 01:58:14.969]  Thank you so much for being with us.
[01:58:14.969 --> 01:58:17.371]  I just bought Jack's book while we were holding.
[01:58:17.371 --> 01:58:18.690]  So I'll read it, Jack.
[01:58:19.252 --> 01:58:19.932]  It's pre-ordered.
[01:58:20.592 --> 01:58:25.093]  And, you know, our condolences to the Russians who were murdered.
[01:58:25.193 --> 01:58:26.513]  We've been talking about it today.
[01:58:26.933 --> 01:58:29.774]  That was a provocation, obviously, and it was mass murder.
[01:58:30.294 --> 01:58:32.674]  And the Russians have every right to defend themselves.
[01:58:33.375 --> 01:58:34.995]  Where they can find their enemies, go get them.
[01:58:35.735 --> 01:58:38.736]  And with full support from many Americans like us.
[01:58:39.356 --> 01:58:46.396]   And so, now, Anne and I and Masako Kanaha and many others have been down in the Darien gap so much, right?
[01:58:46.856 --> 01:58:56.183]  We see organizations like HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, that the Secretary of Homeland Security, Mayorkas, was a board member on HIAS.
[01:58:56.583 --> 01:59:00.406]  He's been down in Darien, pumping money into Darien to get the flows through.
[01:59:00.426 --> 01:59:03.608]  Now, we know Hezbollah are flowing into the United States now.
[01:59:04.008 --> 01:59:09.232]  We know that one was just caught, and he definitely went through Darien, according to the Panamanians, right?
[01:59:09.673 --> 01:59:20.060]  So literally HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, is pumping Hespelot into the United States, not to mention the Chinese Communist Party.
[01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:26.323]  Right now we are actually in the Bahamas because the Chinese are actually taking over places here in the Bahamas.
[01:59:26.564 --> 01:59:27.684]  We're not here on vacation.
[01:59:27.965 --> 01:59:30.026]  We're here because this is America's third border.
[01:59:30.626 --> 01:59:32.627]  And we are absolutely being invaded.
[01:59:33.248 --> 01:59:35.689]  We're being invaded mostly by our own country.
[01:59:36.070 --> 01:59:38.111]  And actually Anne can talk for hours on this.
[01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:48.983]  Yeah, Alex, the sad reality of the entire situation is when you look at everything and you look at who's actually really funding this, Americans are funding their own gallows.
[01:59:49.023 --> 01:59:53.364]  The United States taxpayer is inadvertently having their money diverted to the United Nations.
[01:59:53.424 --> 01:59:55.225]  You have talked about this ad nauseum.
[01:59:55.565 --> 02:00:04.107]  When you look at what happened in Russia, clearly Russia has been, I would say, more of an ally to the United States than NATO has, if you look back in the last hundred, hundred plus years.
[02:00:04.687 --> 02:00:06.268]  Let's go back to the Revolutionary War.
[02:00:06.650 --> 02:00:09.192]  They were crossing blockades, same in the War of 1812.
[02:00:10.433 --> 02:00:12.294]  Did Russia ever invade the United States?
[02:00:12.394 --> 02:00:16.617]  No, the United States invaded Russia, as your previous guest just talked about.
[02:00:16.898 --> 02:00:23.582]  Thank God you have people who can actually bring true historical facts to the situation right now, because you're not going to get it here in the mainstream media.
[02:00:23.602 --> 02:00:25.704]  You're only going to find it on your show and others.
[02:00:26.284 --> 02:00:32.220]   And at the sad truth, and at the end of the day, Alex, People have to make a choice, just like Jack said.
[02:00:32.260 --> 02:00:36.041]  We have to decide, is it going to be team humanity or is it going to be the tyrants?
[02:00:36.121 --> 02:00:40.602]  And right now you have tyrants around the world that are destroying and warring against their people.
[02:00:41.022 --> 02:00:49.404]  And when I look at the Western civilization, what they're doing, run by the International Bank, Inca Ball, that needs, yes, another war, because the dollar is going down in flames.
[02:00:49.484 --> 02:00:51.645]  BRICS is rising like a phoenix out of the ashes.
[02:00:51.665 --> 02:00:56.986]  Well, Ann, that's what I see, and I'm going to shut up, is major globalist desperation, which we go, oh great, they're desperate.
[02:00:57.026 --> 02:00:58.087]  No, that makes them more dangerous.
[02:00:58.127 --> 02:00:58.787]  This is crazy.
[02:00:59.912 --> 02:01:04.253]  Yeah, they're literally a caged animal that has been cornered and they're dying.
[02:01:04.313 --> 02:01:11.655]  They've taken a lot of darts and the Federal Reserve, the International Banking of all, the Bank of International Settlements, they are all under fire.
[02:01:11.715 --> 02:01:11.975]  Why?
[02:01:12.015 --> 02:01:15.236]  Because 75% of the world's GDP has moved away.
[02:01:15.636 --> 02:01:20.698]  And Joe Biden made the unfortunate forced error to kick Russia off swift last year.
[02:01:20.758 --> 02:01:22.118]  And how has that turned out for them?
[02:01:22.158 --> 02:01:23.419]  Well, Russia is not hurting.
[02:01:23.679 --> 02:01:43.708]   Tara Reid was on Kyle Serafin over the last couple of months and she has she was over in Russia because she of course was one of the people who was assaulted by Joe Biden and she was in the ear of the producer telling the producer who was forwarding it to me that she's just astonished at the caliber of the middle class in Russia that they're not living hand-to-mouth like the middle class here in the United States.
[02:01:43.748 --> 02:01:44.868]  Tucker Carlson saw the same thing.
[02:01:44.908 --> 02:01:49.651]  So Ann, let me ask you this and also ask Michael Young this as investigative journalist, both of you.
[02:01:50.759 --> 02:01:52.600]  You've been all over the world in war zones, Michael.
[02:01:53.400 --> 02:02:00.243]  How would you describe this point in time we're in and the fact that the globalists are this desperate?
[02:02:01.043 --> 02:02:01.903]  Talk about ISIS.
[02:02:02.224 --> 02:02:08.686]  I mean, I have the Jerusalem Post admitting ISIS was created by Israel and Obama, but the public still doesn't remember that.
[02:02:08.706 --> 02:02:12.488]  And they go, oh, ISIS took credit, but then they tried to run back to Ukraine.
[02:02:12.548 --> 02:02:15.309]  What do you think of the terror attacks yesterday, Michael Young?
[02:02:16.610 --> 02:02:23.257]  It clearly was sponsored by somebody, you know, to get into Russia and commit that atrocity.
[02:02:23.897 --> 02:02:28.342]  Somebody is behind it, and those are the people that need to be hunted down.
[02:02:28.562 --> 02:02:30.504]  Wherever they are, they may be in Switzerland.
[02:02:31.145 --> 02:02:35.369]  I don't know where they're at, but wherever they are, they need to be hunted down and taken care of.
[02:02:35.814 --> 02:02:38.576]  Can I say something on ISIS, Alex, when it comes to ISIS?
[02:02:38.616 --> 02:02:41.337]  I mean, we all remember that picture of John McCain, right?
[02:02:41.877 --> 02:02:43.058]  Standing there with his friends.
[02:02:43.078 --> 02:02:44.379]  With the ISIS leaders, yeah.
[02:02:44.879 --> 02:02:45.459]  Exactly.
[02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:52.043]  And we know that the CIA, just like every good intelligence organization, has to create their own boogeyman.
[02:02:52.363 --> 02:02:54.625]  Look at, you know, look at Mossad creating Hamas.
[02:02:54.665 --> 02:02:56.766]  Look at CIA creating ISIS.
[02:02:57.296 --> 02:03:00.538]  ISIS equals CIA, CIA equals ISIS.
[02:03:00.598 --> 02:03:08.603]  So for them to come out and for ISIS to stand there and say, oh, we are taking the blame, to me, is really more of a false flag on the whole thing.
[02:03:08.683 --> 02:03:10.704]  I don't believe it was ISIS.
[02:03:10.764 --> 02:03:25.873]  I believe it was our own CIA working with the usual suspects to do exactly this, to create this event, this horrific false flag that murdered over 150 people, I think, at this point, and over 150 more severely injured, and they still expect the death toll to go up.
[02:03:26.294 --> 02:03:31.696]  This has the hallmarks, again, of the Western countries provocating another war, poking the bear.
[02:03:31.736 --> 02:03:44.602]  And how many times is Putin going to be standing there as the adult in the room, holding it together until we can somehow remove this corrupt regime that is being controlled by the international banking cabal so that we can bring back peace to the world.
[02:03:44.882 --> 02:03:54.146]  President Trump managed to sequester peace around the world through international trade deals, unilaterally trading country to country, mano y mano.
[02:03:54.186 --> 02:03:55.207]  He weaponized peace.
[02:03:55.567 --> 02:03:56.228]  With the purse.
[02:03:56.588 --> 02:03:57.648]  And it's really that simple.
[02:03:57.668 --> 02:04:00.270]  And of course, the bankers are showing you just how desperate they are.
[02:04:00.610 --> 02:04:01.771]  The time is running out.
[02:04:01.991 --> 02:04:05.674]  You've got 22 states here in America, Alex, that are standing up gold-backed currencies.
[02:04:05.914 --> 02:04:06.894]  That's how desperate they are.
[02:04:07.034 --> 02:04:07.855]  No, you're right.
[02:04:08.155 --> 02:04:10.036]  And that shows the power of the purse.
[02:04:10.056 --> 02:04:12.838]  People say, oh, Trump couldn't end the war overnight, Michael and Ann.
[02:04:13.379 --> 02:04:14.659]  But the U.S.
[02:04:14.719 --> 02:04:16.100]  is funding 80% of this war.
[02:04:16.140 --> 02:04:17.001]  He could end it like that.
[02:04:18.251 --> 02:04:18.631]  That's right.
[02:04:19.172 --> 02:04:19.572]  That's right.
[02:04:24.036 --> 02:04:28.540]  I've been concerned since before I went to Lithuania before the Ukraine war.
[02:04:28.700 --> 02:04:30.322]  I was there because the weaponized migrants.
[02:04:30.602 --> 02:04:32.344]  I was down in Morocco with Chuck Colton.
[02:04:32.664 --> 02:04:34.906]  We noticed we called Frontex up in Warsaw.
[02:04:34.926 --> 02:04:38.189]  Frontex is sort of like EU border patrol.
[02:04:38.209 --> 02:04:39.530]  They're a bunch of clowns actually.
[02:04:39.850 --> 02:04:46.419]   But we thought that we saw that Belarus was pushing people to Poland and Lithuania.
[02:04:46.459 --> 02:04:47.520]  Poland was not letting them in.
[02:04:47.960 --> 02:04:50.582]  We flew from Morocco up to Vilnius, Lithuania.
[02:04:50.902 --> 02:04:52.363]  And I spent five weeks up there.
[02:04:52.663 --> 02:04:54.004]  Chuck went back after about a week.
[02:04:55.265 --> 02:04:57.527]  And I was concerned, actually, that a war would kick off.
[02:04:57.607 --> 02:04:59.468]  I was publishing it for five weeks.
[02:04:59.928 --> 02:05:04.131]  And not that I was concerned that a war would kick off in Ukraine, but that something was going on.
[02:05:04.472 --> 02:05:12.397]  But then as things heated up quite a bit more, I've been concerned that the United States would actually fire the first strike on a nuclear strike.
[02:05:12.777 --> 02:05:15.640]  I mean, look, our government has gone completely insane.
[02:05:15.940 --> 02:05:17.902]  And the Russian government is not insane.
[02:05:18.423 --> 02:05:19.444]  They're still human.
[02:05:19.544 --> 02:05:22.527]  And Jack is right with the title of his book, Unhuman.
[02:05:22.667 --> 02:05:27.092]  Look, we've got a government that's trying to encourage boys that they're girls and girls that they're boys.
[02:05:27.152 --> 02:05:28.633]  How more insane can you get?
[02:05:28.953 --> 02:05:29.814]  They're pumping drugs.
[02:05:29.974 --> 02:05:37.419]   I mean, they're allowing Chinese to come up Through the Darien Gap and across our borders in every which way, from here in the Bahamas up in Florida.
[02:05:37.439 --> 02:05:38.739]  They're demonically influenced.
[02:05:38.759 --> 02:05:39.519]  So speak to that.
[02:05:39.799 --> 02:05:40.980]  You guys went down there.
[02:05:41.580 --> 02:05:44.181]  You brought dozens and dozens of people down there.
[02:05:44.601 --> 02:05:46.662]  They have shut down the main Chi-Com base.
[02:05:46.702 --> 02:05:48.722]  They burned it out, which you predicted two weeks ago.
[02:05:48.742 --> 02:05:49.523]  They're about to shut it down.
[02:05:49.583 --> 02:05:50.303]  They shut it down.
[02:05:50.823 --> 02:05:52.644]  You even put out today, you're not a drama queen.
[02:05:53.084 --> 02:05:54.945]  You said you're worried about your life.
[02:05:55.045 --> 02:05:59.006]  You guys just exposed a major UN invasion point.
[02:06:00.273 --> 02:06:00.874]  Yeah.
[02:06:00.974 --> 02:06:10.143]  And the fact of the matter is that you're right, Alex, they did shut down that China camp, but they've also now removed highest signs out of the rest of the camps down there.
[02:06:10.163 --> 02:06:16.970]  And of course, Doctors Without Borders, that we like to refer to as Doctors Without Morals, has been permanently suspended in Panama.
[02:06:17.352 --> 02:06:25.274]  Because again, what you're seeing is nothing but a massive money laundering operation vis-a-vis the United Nations funding these NGOs like Doctors Without Borders.
[02:06:25.294 --> 02:06:30.315]  But the good news is you guys spotlighted it and it's having major success, which shows there's not just evil in the universe.
[02:06:31.735 --> 02:06:32.616]  That's exactly right.
[02:06:33.076 --> 02:06:34.156]  You can fight back.
[02:06:34.196 --> 02:06:36.116]  You can punch evil right back in the mouth.
[02:06:36.156 --> 02:06:38.757]  But you know what you're not seeing coming to the Darien Gap, Alex?
[02:06:39.057 --> 02:06:40.097]  You're not seeing Russians.
[02:06:40.397 --> 02:06:42.858]  You're not seeing Russians trying to invade the United States.
[02:06:43.260 --> 02:06:44.261]  Alex, can I say something?
[02:06:44.081 --> 02:06:45.081]  We haven't found a Russian.
[02:06:45.081 --> 02:06:46.081]  We haven't found a Russian.
[02:06:46.081 --> 02:06:47.081]  We've seen...
[02:06:47.081 --> 02:06:49.720]  Russian would pop off the map if we found a Russian.
[02:06:49.720 --> 02:06:50.721]  We haven't.
[02:06:50.721 --> 02:06:54.320]  Yeah, we're not like Russia files.
[02:06:54.320 --> 02:06:55.320]  We're just...
[02:06:55.320 --> 02:06:56.320]  Russia isn't our business.
[02:06:56.320 --> 02:06:58.940]  Alex, can I say something?
[02:06:58.940 --> 02:07:03.520]   When I was in Special Forces, I spent three years on two different A-teams training to
[02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:07.480]  parachute into Poland to kill Russians, right?
[02:07:07.480 --> 02:07:09.681]  And we did extensive training to do that, right?
[02:07:09.921 --> 02:07:12.302]  And then I lived in Poland after the army for two years.
[02:07:12.682 --> 02:07:16.984]  I've heard, you know, I mean, literally, and I don't have anything against Russians.
[02:07:17.324 --> 02:07:20.025]  I see the Russians now as the sane people.
[02:07:20.445 --> 02:07:25.087]  They are clearly the ones that we're trying to make Ukraine a NATO country.
[02:07:25.487 --> 02:07:28.908]  That's like China putting nuclear weapons here in the Bahamas, right?
[02:07:28.929 --> 02:07:30.729]  I mean, that's a big, big deal.
[02:07:31.049 --> 02:07:32.610]  That's a provocation for Russia.
[02:07:33.930 --> 02:07:36.671]  And quite frankly, I don't want Ukraine in NATO.
[02:07:37.192 --> 02:07:39.653]  I wouldn't want them on a good day in NATO, to be clear.
[02:07:40.973 --> 02:07:46.575]  At the end of the day, NATO has become... Listen, I saw NATO fight or not fight in Afghanistan.
[02:07:46.895 --> 02:07:48.636]  They're essentially worthless, you know?
[02:07:48.956 --> 02:07:49.816]  I mean, seriously.
[02:07:50.056 --> 02:07:53.118]  I mean, you got the... Anyway, I could go on for hours.
[02:07:53.378 --> 02:07:54.598]  Anyway, sorry, sir.
[02:07:54.898 --> 02:07:55.839]  No, you're dead on.
[02:07:55.939 --> 02:08:00.680]  So if the globalists are this desperate, we go, oh, they're a joke, but they're in control still.
[02:08:01.081 --> 02:08:02.081]  What are they going to pull next?
[02:08:04.445 --> 02:08:05.826]  That's a great question, Alex.
[02:08:05.966 --> 02:08:10.190]  I don't think there's anything that's off the table and up to and including nuclear weapons.
[02:08:10.430 --> 02:08:12.132]  And let's not forget Uranium One.
[02:08:12.252 --> 02:08:17.837]  Let's not forget that Hillary Clinton managed to, you know, get our uranium over to the Russians.
[02:08:17.877 --> 02:08:23.662]  Let's not forget that she had that fake reset when she couldn't even spell reset in Russian properly.
[02:08:24.543 --> 02:08:28.887]  They, of course, would like nothing more than to make it look like that and we have missing uranium.
[02:08:28.927 --> 02:08:30.769]  There's plenty of uranium that is missing.
[02:08:31.482 --> 02:08:44.306]  The fact that a heat signature from Uranium One could actually show up in a bomb somewhere around the world and they could try and blame Russia when in fact there's been plenty of missing Uranium One elements all over the place.
[02:08:44.326 --> 02:08:46.527]  So you're worried about a nuclear false flag against Russia?
[02:08:47.727 --> 02:08:48.087]  Of course.
[02:08:48.107 --> 02:08:49.268]  Yeah.
[02:08:49.728 --> 02:08:53.689]  I absolutely believe that they would be that stupid because these people are that psychopathic.
[02:08:53.709 --> 02:08:54.890]  So let's war game this.
[02:08:54.910 --> 02:08:59.051]  If the globalists are desperate, which they are, they've opened our borders, they've done all this, what are they going to do next?
[02:09:00.489 --> 02:09:05.593]  Well, why are these people building bunkers that they can survive under underground for 10 months fully?
[02:09:05.673 --> 02:09:12.980]  I mean, there's there's there's billionaires that have yachts that have bunkers 10 feet below water level that they can survive with oxygen and food for 10 months.
[02:09:13.340 --> 02:09:14.281]  What are they running from?
[02:09:14.341 --> 02:09:15.021]  What are they scared of?
[02:09:15.042 --> 02:09:16.663]  I mean, clearly, we know we're being invaded here.
[02:09:17.025 --> 02:09:22.369]  Clearly we're already seeing illegals get in weapons, the pathways to citizenship through the police departments and through our military.
[02:09:22.629 --> 02:09:25.512]  We have insiders that are telling us they're... Oh, arming the illegal aliens!
[02:09:25.532 --> 02:09:29.355]  The Obama judge that's anti-gun... Here's the article, I'll show it to you right now.
[02:09:29.895 --> 02:09:32.998]  The Obama judge says illegals can own guns and buy guns.
[02:09:33.038 --> 02:09:33.878]  I saw it six months ago.
[02:09:33.918 --> 02:09:36.801]  ATF telling gun dealers to give illegals guns.
[02:09:37.581 --> 02:09:47.254]  So we have this federal judge who rules illegal immigrants can carry guns, and then we've got the Attorney General saying he's coming after gun owners extrajudicially to take their guns.
[02:09:47.615 --> 02:09:49.517]  So take citizens' guns, army illegals.
[02:09:49.557 --> 02:09:50.539]  What's that about, Michael Young?
[02:09:52.421 --> 02:09:53.762]  Oh, we know what it's about.
[02:09:53.802 --> 02:09:55.043]  You talk about it all the time.
[02:09:55.503 --> 02:09:59.806]  Every time I watch your show, almost every time you talk about this stuff, they're coming to kill us.
[02:10:00.226 --> 02:10:00.726]  Straight up.
[02:10:01.107 --> 02:10:01.667]  Hardcore.
[02:10:02.067 --> 02:10:03.168]  They're coming to replace us.
[02:10:03.208 --> 02:10:04.669]  This is a replacement population.
[02:10:04.989 --> 02:10:05.770]  It's a genocide.
[02:10:06.070 --> 02:10:07.331]  Just like the death jabs were.
[02:10:07.391 --> 02:10:09.412]  What's happening to the British Royal Family, by the way?
[02:10:09.712 --> 02:10:10.293]  The evil family.
[02:10:10.413 --> 02:10:11.233]  Oh yeah, okay.
[02:10:11.253 --> 02:10:13.895]  Kate Middleton's dying of cancer at 30-something years old.
[02:10:15.270 --> 02:10:21.312]  Yeah, this looks like they actually got hit with the... As you know, a lot of what's going on is oligarch versus oligarch fighting.
[02:10:21.712 --> 02:10:27.274]  And anybody who took the death jab and who was not warned not to take it is not in the club.
[02:10:27.614 --> 02:10:29.875]  They did not have a seat on the arc, right?
[02:10:30.355 --> 02:10:34.577]  And if they took the death jab and were not warned, guess what?
[02:10:34.777 --> 02:10:36.277]  Somebody was trying to take you out.
[02:10:38.118 --> 02:10:38.978]  Incredibly said.
[02:10:39.018 --> 02:10:40.419]  So the war has already begun.
[02:10:42.236 --> 02:10:42.656]  It's on.
[02:10:42.956 --> 02:10:44.716]  I mean, that was the ultimate smart bomb.
[02:10:45.437 --> 02:10:52.698]  I mean, the death jabs and the information war behind that, that was, I mean, that was much more intense than any cruise missile ever developed.
[02:10:53.138 --> 02:10:54.018]  I mean, think about that.
[02:10:54.178 --> 02:10:57.299]  You, InfoWars, the name of your show says it all.
[02:10:57.499 --> 02:11:03.840]  As you well know, more than anybody on the planet, Information War is the PhD level of warfare.
[02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:08.381]  Everything else is subordinate to Information War, thus the name InfoWars.
[02:11:08.885 --> 02:11:17.987]  I mean, Alex, when you think about the fact that, you know, this is an oligarchical war against oligarch versus oligarch, that is as old as the test of time, right?
[02:11:18.027 --> 02:11:21.428]  You can go back over centuries and look at all the different oligarch families.
[02:11:21.628 --> 02:11:31.451]  And while you may have people that are coming together, like the CCP and the World Economic Forum, let's be clear, you know, the British oligarchy has not been pleasant to Hong Kong.
[02:11:31.491 --> 02:11:34.292]  Go back to the Opium Wars, look at what they did to the Chinese.
[02:11:34.672 --> 02:11:46.943]   It would not be surprising at all to have the Chinese being saying, you know what, we're Fine together with the West because the enemy of the enemy is my ally and we're going to take out some people that have pissed us off over the last several hundred years and we're going to move in.
[02:11:47.444 --> 02:11:53.853]  And unfortunately, like Michael said, you know, it looks very strategic when you look at three members of the royal family.
[02:11:54.484 --> 02:11:57.745]  The Duchess of York, King Charles, and now Kate Middleton.
[02:11:58.045 --> 02:12:00.105]  Tragic that they're all suffering cancer.
[02:12:00.465 --> 02:12:06.327]  But at the same token, you know, these are the same people that drank the Kool-Aid and pushed this as if, you know, they were doctors themselves.
[02:12:06.367 --> 02:12:10.588]  Well it just shows how the globals are getting rid of all the old elites and bringing in their new technocracy.
[02:12:11.328 --> 02:12:15.189]  Alex, and the princess in Thailand, she had four.
[02:12:15.816 --> 02:12:18.638]  She had four jabs, right?
[02:12:19.018 --> 02:12:25.602]  I mean, it looks like they're trying to take out, as you well, you've said it so many times, they're taking out some of these oligarchs.
[02:12:26.042 --> 02:12:29.725]  And they've done it with information war and then take the jab and see you later.
[02:12:30.025 --> 02:12:30.265]  Right.
[02:12:31.025 --> 02:12:33.267]  It's not going to end well for anybody, Alex.
[02:12:33.387 --> 02:12:35.828]  I don't think anybody is immune from what's coming right now.
[02:12:36.088 --> 02:12:46.866]   I think everything is on the table and nobody is immune, including the useful idiots in this country who continue to Stand by and not to defy unlawful orders.
[02:12:47.007 --> 02:12:51.734]  Anybody in the military, I mean I'm talking directly to our military, to our Border Patrol, to our National Guard.
[02:12:52.075 --> 02:13:04.263]   If you are not standing up and defying these unlawful orders to allow this invasion to continue when you know Even as a National Guard, you have the right under the Constitution, Article 1, Section 10, Clause 3 to defend this border.
[02:13:04.663 --> 02:13:08.266]  Just like people around the country have the right to defend their border.
[02:13:08.626 --> 02:13:11.548]  If you're not doing that, then you are guilty of treason.
[02:13:11.688 --> 02:13:12.648]  It is that simple.
[02:13:12.728 --> 02:13:18.452]  And the American people are going to wake up because we're on our own information war campaign here to educate people.
[02:13:18.832 --> 02:13:21.734]  About the lawfulness and the civic duty that people have, Alex.
[02:13:22.114 --> 02:13:22.715]  You're doing it.
[02:13:22.795 --> 02:13:23.415]  Michael's doing it.
[02:13:23.515 --> 02:13:23.915]  I'm doing it.
[02:13:23.995 --> 02:13:25.456]  Lots of people are waking up to this fact.
[02:13:25.516 --> 02:13:29.759]  And when that collective group does, and they organize, and they are organizing.
[02:13:29.999 --> 02:13:31.120]  They're organizing right now.
[02:13:31.604 --> 02:13:34.185]  A lot of people are going to be in a bad situation.
[02:13:34.385 --> 02:13:35.866]  There's still time to turn it around.
[02:13:36.306 --> 02:13:39.488]  But, you know, again, we can lead the horse to water.
[02:13:39.848 --> 02:13:40.968]  We can lead them to water, Alex.
[02:13:41.008 --> 02:13:43.670]  But do they want to drink the truth or do they want to swallow it?
[02:13:43.710 --> 02:13:44.190]  That's it.
[02:13:44.210 --> 02:13:47.892]  I mean, look, if the Russians were fighting us and attacking our country, I'd be against them.
[02:13:48.092 --> 02:13:48.672]  Boom, it's easy.
[02:13:49.192 --> 02:13:50.073]  It's not the Russians.
[02:13:50.133 --> 02:13:50.993]  That's a distraction.
[02:13:51.273 --> 02:13:53.334]  They call us all Russians and we're against destroying America.
[02:13:53.754 --> 02:13:56.496]  The new world order is taking over right now.
[02:13:57.256 --> 02:14:01.478]  And they are badly, they are, they are, they are organized, but they're badly coordinated.
[02:14:01.779 --> 02:14:02.599]  They're falling apart.
[02:14:02.619 --> 02:14:03.920]  This is such a historical moment.
[02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:06.461]  Michael Yawn and Vander Schill, closing comments.
[02:14:08.883 --> 02:14:13.865]  You know, watching your show today while we were on hold, it makes me want to fly over to Russia and hear their side of the story.
[02:14:14.406 --> 02:14:17.087]  That's the bottom line from watching your show right now.
[02:14:17.988 --> 02:14:19.548]  I gotta say, what a show today.
[02:14:19.648 --> 02:14:20.229]  I mean, wow.
[02:14:21.874 --> 02:14:38.642]  Yeah, it's powerful stuff, Alex, and this is that moment in history that people are going to look back in 250 years and they're going to see Alex Jones and Mike Ayanna go, wow, those guys brought the truth and they brought the heat and they helped educate America, they educated the world on the truth that our government is as dirty as dirty get.
[02:14:39.122 --> 02:14:47.986]  And the minute people can finally wake up to that fact, Alex, you know, there's that part in the Declaration of Independence where it talks about alter and abolish.
[02:14:48.246 --> 02:14:49.507]  It doesn't talk about overthrow.
[02:14:49.967 --> 02:14:50.868]  Alter and abolish.
[02:14:51.208 --> 02:14:52.609]  It's not about getting rid of government.
[02:14:52.669 --> 02:14:55.010]  We need government, but we don't need the one we've got.
[02:14:55.211 --> 02:14:57.852]  Well, let me ask this question in closing.
[02:14:58.213 --> 02:15:03.336]  Clearly, they have brought in millions of military engineers in the last three years.
[02:15:04.016 --> 02:15:06.738]  Clearly, they're being armed by Obama's judges.
[02:15:08.579 --> 02:15:13.042]  Clearly, they're planning a major uprising, which they've said they're going to do.
[02:15:13.062 --> 02:15:16.465]  If Trump wins, they're going to say that, you know, he's racist.
[02:15:16.485 --> 02:15:18.446]  There's an uprising by BLM, the Muslims.
[02:15:20.265 --> 02:15:24.286]  Antifa, and it's not logical to think they could do this.
[02:15:24.826 --> 02:15:26.667]  We wouldn't see through it, but they're still going to try it.
[02:15:27.047 --> 02:15:29.848]  Michael Yeun and Ann Vander Stil, how do you expect this to unfold?
[02:15:30.168 --> 02:15:32.589]  Because no doubt the sleeper cells are here.
[02:15:32.609 --> 02:15:34.709]  What we just saw in Russia is a prelude.
[02:15:35.049 --> 02:15:36.090]  How do you see this playing out?
[02:15:37.350 --> 02:15:38.450]  Extremely bloody.
[02:15:39.410 --> 02:15:40.291]  Extremely bloody.
[02:15:40.531 --> 02:15:43.553]   The likes of which I mean, I call it gigaside.
[02:15:43.593 --> 02:15:45.495]  I've been calling it that for a long time now.
[02:15:45.856 --> 02:15:47.397]  You know, giga meaning billion.
[02:15:47.738 --> 02:15:57.508]  I mean, and so far as the death jabs go, plus the clear famines that will be unfolding over time, there's a long flash to bang on these famines, but they're clearly coming.
[02:15:57.881 --> 02:16:11.968]  And that drives that human osmotic pressure, the push and the pull of migration, that hop, the human osmotic pressure to go right through places like Darien Gap, right up on our shores in Florida, Camp of the Saints style, through our northern border, Canada.
[02:16:12.728 --> 02:16:13.429]  It's hardcore.
[02:16:13.529 --> 02:16:19.091]  I mean, this is going to be an incredible war the likes of which humanity has never seen.
[02:16:19.491 --> 02:16:20.332]  It's crystal clear.
[02:16:20.992 --> 02:16:23.154]  And it's all about conditions.
[02:16:23.234 --> 02:16:25.035]  As you know, you've talked about this before.
[02:16:25.355 --> 02:16:26.536]  It's not about sparks.
[02:16:26.796 --> 02:16:27.877]  It's about conditions.
[02:16:28.218 --> 02:16:30.960]  And the conditions are set and they're becoming worse.
[02:16:31.140 --> 02:16:32.080]  The sparks are coming.
[02:16:32.100 --> 02:16:38.265]  You know, Alex, the United Nations has a responsibility to protect doctrine built right in.
[02:16:38.965 --> 02:16:40.707]  And they have that there.
[02:16:40.747 --> 02:16:44.769]  That clause is there for moments when countries go completely upside down.
[02:16:45.370 --> 02:16:59.426]   And General Flynn has talked about, you know, the Chinese right now currently have seven, at least seven, I think I've seen seven divisions come through the Darien Gap.
[02:16:59.706 --> 02:17:03.510]  I mean, a little bit of exaggeration there, but maybe three divisions.
[02:17:03.910 --> 02:17:05.292]  And I'm not exaggerating on that.
[02:17:05.332 --> 02:17:06.493]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[02:17:06.813 --> 02:17:22.065]   So imagine if we have containers stashed around the country with blue helmets, UN uniforms, and then of course any other arsenal that You know, these heathens that have come across the border that do not believe in the Constitution, clearly because they're coming in illegally, they're stepping on it as they come across.
[02:17:22.485 --> 02:17:23.645]  Imagine when that erupts.
[02:17:23.785 --> 02:17:29.788]  Imagine when the EBT cards are cut off and all these migrants, quote, migrants, don't have money to put food on the table.
[02:17:29.868 --> 02:17:30.668]  Where are they going to come?
[02:17:31.068 --> 02:17:34.269]  We're going to see our cities burn and you're going to see suburbia invaded.
[02:17:34.669 --> 02:17:41.691]  That's what's coming and the UN is poised and ready to come in and set up martial law under the quotes, responsibility to protect.
[02:17:41.772 --> 02:17:46.293]  And they even got movies like Civil War premiering next week.
[02:17:48.034 --> 02:17:51.795]  Isn't that just incredible how they love to predict the future right under our noses?
[02:17:52.395 --> 02:17:53.375]  It's quite extraordinary.
[02:17:53.415 --> 02:17:56.296]  They are just absolutely mocking us every step of the way, Alex.
[02:17:56.556 --> 02:17:58.497]  Alright guys, how do people find both of you?
[02:18:00.287 --> 02:18:01.707]  We're on X. Every day.

[02:19:53.861 --> 02:20:00.502]   'Cause we're all seeing through rose colored dark leaves as the Bible says, we're all fallen creatures.
[02:20:00.502 --> 02:20:03.181]   And so nothing we do is perfect like God does, but it's close.
