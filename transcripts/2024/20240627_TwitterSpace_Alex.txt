[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.640]   It is only by going within and really making that connection to God that we can truly empower
[00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:27.897]  That's why the globalists bombard us with toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able to basically reach out beyond the third dimension.
[00:00:28.097 --> 00:00:31.097]  And that's what the incredible products come in at Infowars.com.

[00:01:15.956 --> 00:01:18.378]  Several underperforming across the United States.
[00:01:20.019 --> 00:01:22.621]  You know, I don't know if I can blame that on the Biden economy.
[00:01:24.723 --> 00:01:26.024]  They never really had good food.
[00:01:26.084 --> 00:01:27.965]  But then again, I guess people didn't go for the food.
[00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:36.872]  And then when the other assets started to decline because of diversity hires, and they didn't want to be fat phobic, maybe that's what did it.
[00:01:38.373 --> 00:01:39.854]  Then again, maybe it's just the Biden economy.
[00:01:41.886 --> 00:01:43.987]  All right, we are about to have debate night here at InfoWars.
[00:01:44.027 --> 00:01:45.607]  Very much looking forward to that.
[00:01:46.207 --> 00:01:47.687]  We're going to be with you all night long.
[00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:49.808]  We're going to start taking calls now.
[00:01:52.088 --> 00:01:52.509]  I'll tell you what.
[00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:53.789]  Let's see here.
[00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:55.229]  Let me let me kind of go through this.
[00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.870]  Let me go through this list of callers we have.
[00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.331]  Yeah, it looks like everybody is pretty much on the debate.
[00:02:05.772 --> 00:02:06.532]  So we'll stick with that.
[00:02:07.792 --> 00:02:10.033]  Let's go to Anthony in Georgia.
[00:02:10.173 --> 00:02:11.033]  Anthony, you're on the air.
[00:02:11.073 --> 00:02:11.453]  Go ahead.
[00:02:13.348 --> 00:02:14.369]  Thank you.
[00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:16.070]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.113]  I've been listening to you since y'all started with Roger Stone in 2017.
[00:02:20.153 --> 00:02:23.916]  I've been listening to Info Wars ever since.
[00:02:24.237 --> 00:02:25.277]  I really love your show.
[00:02:25.297 --> 00:02:26.398]  Thank you very much.
[00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:28.720]  I appreciate what you guys are doing.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:39.975]   My question was, I was just wondering, you know, you were talking about earlier that You know, they're having just Biden and Trump in one room.
[00:02:40.675 --> 00:02:44.218]  And are the people asking the questions, they're going to be there too, right?
[00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:50.683]  So, yeah, it's my understanding that it's going to be the two moderators and then Trump and Biden on a stage.
[00:02:50.783 --> 00:02:51.283]  And that's it.
[00:02:51.664 --> 00:02:53.105]  Those are the only people allowed in the studio.
[00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:56.950]  This is going to be a CNN.
[00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.873]  I mean, you know, they can probably afford to lose that building, right?
[00:03:02.413 --> 00:03:21.968]   So my question is, I kind of wonder, you know, with all the stuff that's going on, them wanting to set up camps and stuff, what's the probability of them just taking out both Biden and Trump Yeah, I'd say the chances are next to zero.
[00:03:21.788 --> 00:03:24.788]  And then they don't have to deal with Trump anymore.
[00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:29.788]   And then just putting this under martial law and saying, the Russians blew up the building.
[00:03:29.788 --> 00:03:35.627]  There's a submarine off the coast of Florida.
[00:03:35.627 --> 00:03:38.867]  Yeah, I'd say the chances are next to zero.
[00:03:38.867 --> 00:03:44.028]   I guess nothing is too far fetched for the current timeline, but I'd say it's a very
[00:03:44.028 --> 00:03:45.028]  unlikelihood.
[00:03:45.028 --> 00:03:53.028]   You just think of the least possible scenario and it usually comes about.
[00:03:52.726 --> 00:03:57.409]  But anyway, I just figured I'd get your take on that.
[00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:05.935]  I'm curious to see, what I'm curious, what I do think is a very high potential here is there's going to be protests outside of the building.
[00:04:07.846 --> 00:04:08.606]  Of what nature?
[00:04:08.766 --> 00:04:09.107]  I don't know.
[00:04:09.167 --> 00:04:12.969]  Maybe anti-Biden because of what's going on with Israel.
[00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.931]  That's kind of been the protest of the season.
[00:04:14.971 --> 00:04:19.554]  That's been the protest flavor of the month is anti-Israel with the leftists that get out there.
[00:04:20.175 --> 00:04:23.918]  So I'm curious because they got all these huge walls that are installed outside.
[00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.560]  So maybe they're expecting anti-Biden protests as well.
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.862]  That's going to be an interesting thing, I think, to monitor.
[00:04:30.643 --> 00:04:31.684]  Anthony, thank you for the call.
[00:04:32.624 --> 00:04:34.466]  Let's go to Ethan in Seattle.
[00:04:34.646 --> 00:04:35.527]  Ethan, you're on the air.
[00:04:35.347 --> 00:04:45.347]  Go ahead. Yes, go ahead. Hey, so I had a.
[00:04:45.632 --> 00:04:49.255]  I guess it's kind of a weird question about Trump when he's in the debate stage.
[00:04:49.796 --> 00:05:00.885]  I thought, and it would have been probably a little bit better if he wore, but I know that CNN was saying, hey, Prime Minister, he was just saying, hey, don't broadcast this on anything other than, like, you know, our network.
[00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:09.132]  So I was curious, or maybe it would have been a good idea if he had, like, livestreamed on Instagram on his phone and had it in his pockets and they cut his mic, you'd still hear him talk.
[00:05:09.633 --> 00:05:11.234]  So I don't know, I just thought that'd be kind of cool.
[00:05:11.974 --> 00:05:17.436]  I think Trump should definitely record it.
[00:05:18.416 --> 00:05:19.416]  Yeah, sure.
[00:05:19.716 --> 00:05:26.158]  I mean, look, I get interviewed for documentaries and stuff, and I record it, and this is even with friends of mine.
[00:05:26.538 --> 00:05:34.661]  Like, even with friends of mine that I know I trust, and they know that I just record everything independently, they don't take it personally, I just do it out of habit for this exact reason.
[00:05:34.761 --> 00:05:39.382]  So yeah, Trump should definitely, I mean, but they'll probably stop him from doing that.
[00:05:41.784 --> 00:05:42.024]  Right.
[00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:55.436]  And I guess another thing, not really debate related, but unfortunately here in Washington State, as communist as this, you know, piece of crap state is, I'm stuck here right now for work reasons, but we only have mail-in voter, and that's about it.
[00:05:55.476 --> 00:05:57.518]  There's no actual polls you go to, so I'm curious.
[00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:05.946]  I don't really know what to do there, you know, because I don't really trust the, you know, my vote is actually going to be counted, or anybody's vote for that matter.
[00:06:07.836 --> 00:06:11.919]  Well, look, this is why the Senate races are so easy to steal.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.162]  And why it should be back to the House of Representatives to choose senators.
[00:06:17.463 --> 00:06:25.869]  Because they can just stuff the ballots and win Senate races in what would otherwise be red states.
[00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.852]  Maybe Georgia is the most prime example of that right now.
[00:06:29.932 --> 00:06:32.954]  Pennsylvania, another great example of these red states.
[00:06:33.214 --> 00:06:33.975]  They're red states.
[00:06:34.807 --> 00:06:39.909]  But they stuffed the ballots in the major cities and they went, I mean, Illinois, I mean, you name it.
[00:06:40.989 --> 00:06:46.090]  These are red states, but because of a highly concentrated blue area, they get to control the Senate.
[00:06:46.831 --> 00:06:51.792]  It's completely against the political science of this country and the way it was founded under the Constitution.
[00:06:53.082 --> 00:06:58.567]  And I guess my last quick question and then I'll pop off to Assange and being freed.
[00:06:58.927 --> 00:07:00.108]  Thank God Assange is free.
[00:07:00.568 --> 00:07:08.735]  I'm just curious how that, maybe you think how that would, if it even be a question or you know how they probably just... Well if that's all speculation at this point, it's speculation.
[00:07:08.775 --> 00:07:13.739]  We don't know the deal that was cut and we don't know Assange's health.
[00:07:13.799 --> 00:07:15.681]  We don't know what intentions he has.
[00:07:16.802 --> 00:07:24.620]   I mean, I'd be surprised if it doesn't have some influence even if it's just by somebody using that as a Hey Owen, man.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.642]  It's good to talk to you as always, man.
[00:07:28.682 --> 00:07:30.483]  First of all, love that turbo Porsche.
[00:07:30.503 --> 00:07:31.063]  I love that body.
[00:07:31.123 --> 00:07:32.304]  Both for paintball and trucking.
[00:07:32.124 --> 00:07:36.543]   I think it's a fair question. All right, let's go to Stewie in Illinois. Stewie, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[00:07:36.543 --> 00:07:40.543]  Hey Owen, man, it's good to talk to you as always, man.
[00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:45.784]   First of all, love that turbo Porsche. I love that body, both for paintball and trucking.
[00:07:45.784 --> 00:07:48.784]  You said for paintball?
[00:07:48.784 --> 00:07:51.784]  Yup, paintball and trucking.
[00:07:51.784 --> 00:07:53.284]  Does it help the wounds?
[00:07:53.429 --> 00:07:54.550]  Or do you just never get hit, probably?
[00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:56.490]  You're moving so fast on a turbo-force.
[00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.331]  I do my best not to get shot, but it doesn't matter.
[00:08:00.511 --> 00:08:02.891]  No matter how good you are, you're going to get shot.
[00:08:02.911 --> 00:08:04.051]  But it more tears your body up.
[00:08:04.391 --> 00:08:13.833]  Yeah, man, why I'm calling in, though, that caller, it was a day or two ago, he was saying that Biden's in hiding and he's pre-recording these debates.
[00:08:14.693 --> 00:08:21.141]   And, you know, with this two-minute delay, They could just slip in these pre-recorded things just like
[00:08:21.141 --> 00:08:22.901]  Obama did when he said he got bin Laden.
[00:08:22.901 --> 00:08:30.259]   And Trump's gonna come out and he's gonna say, Biden was all this and that and terrible like
[00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:35.221]   he is, he's crapping all over the place. But everybody on TV is not gonna see it because
[00:08:35.221 --> 00:08:39.061]   they flipped in all this pre-recorded stuff and it's gonna make Trump look like he's actually
[00:08:39.061 --> 00:08:48.259]   insane, which they've been putting up on CNN like crazy. >> Well, I really don't wanna lend
[00:08:48.259 --> 00:08:52.100]   too much time to this theory because I just don't see it being.
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:57.061]   I'm not saying that it's not possible, it's possible, I just don't see it as plausible.
[00:08:57.061 --> 00:09:04.100]   That would be such a hard thing to pull off. I mean, it would just be so hard to pull off
[00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.380]   without people noticing, even with the delay, it doesn't make it any easier.
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:12.581]  You know more than I do, man.
[00:09:12.717 --> 00:09:23.904]  I mean, just the timing of it and the confusion of it to try to run all that live would just be... I mean, I'm telling you, that would just be tough.
[00:09:24.545 --> 00:09:25.445]  That would just be tough.
[00:09:26.726 --> 00:09:29.668]  I mean, maybe they have it as a backup plan?
[00:09:29.808 --> 00:09:33.831]  Maybe they could have something like that in the holster in case?
[00:09:34.791 --> 00:09:46.185]   But again, The only way to mitigate any of these shenanigans, whether it's pre-taped stuff or them editing a Biden fumble out or whatever, is Trump, they need to have their own recording device.
[00:09:46.966 --> 00:09:47.486]  I mean, that's it.
[00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:49.207]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:09:49.467 --> 00:09:52.049]  They're not letting anyone else in the studio, folks.
[00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:55.591]  No one else is in the studio.
[00:09:56.231 --> 00:10:00.053]  So, I mean, theoretically, they could do whatever the hell they wanted, and who would even know the difference?
[00:10:01.574 --> 00:10:03.535]  So Trump needs to have a live monitor.
[00:10:03.995 --> 00:10:05.136]  He needs to see what's live.
[00:10:06.044 --> 00:10:15.287]  He needs to see the monitor of what's going out on the screen, and he needs to have a recording device with him in there to make sure they don't pull any shenanigans.
[00:10:16.508 --> 00:10:20.589]  But this is about to be the most rigged debate in the history of presidential debates.
[00:10:20.869 --> 00:10:30.132]  I mean, short of going in there and bashing Trump with a baseball bat, or ripping out his vocal cords, you know, I mean, that's how bad it's getting.
[00:10:30.152 --> 00:10:31.433]  They're gonna, he's a felon!
[00:10:32.463 --> 00:10:39.488]  You know, he's a rapist and he's a racist and he's the problem with all your lives and the moderators are gonna just sit there.
[00:10:39.508 --> 00:10:42.730]  I mean, this is gonna be, it's gonna be a three-on-one handicap match.
[00:10:44.111 --> 00:10:51.877]  So I get it and I've been receiving a lot of messages and people like, hey, why are you so, you know, why are you so jovial or why is this comical to you?
[00:10:52.417 --> 00:10:57.761]  I mean, believe me, I'm not happy how corrupt our government is or how corrupt our media is, of course not.
[00:10:57.901 --> 00:11:05.647]   But I mean, this whole thing is about to be so vindicating that yeah I'm kinda like licking my chops like this is
[00:11:05.647 --> 00:11:08.566]   gonna be hilarious they're about to go three-on-one against Trump
[00:11:08.566 --> 00:11:14.867]   and it's gonna be the most obvious rig job ever just completely confirming everything we've been telling

[00:13:58.676 --> 00:13:59.557]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:13:59.877 --> 00:14:00.198]  Today.
[00:14:04.439 --> 00:14:05.840]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:14.986]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Chase Geiser, joined in the InfoWars Command Center here in Austin, Texas by Harrison Smith and Ellen Troyer.
[00:14:15.086 --> 00:14:17.668]  Alex Jones will be in the studio imminently.
[00:14:17.708 --> 00:14:22.111]  We have a bunch of amazing guests for pre-debate and post-debate analysis.
[00:14:22.431 --> 00:14:26.014]  Roger Stone is going to be joining us, Robert Barnes and others.
[00:14:26.494 --> 00:14:33.859]  So thank you so much for tuning in as we cover this historic moment in our nation's history, this rigged debate hosted by CNN.
[00:14:33.698 --> 00:14:38.698]   CNN in just a couple of hours. Harrison, I'm gonna go to you first. Harrison, what
[00:14:38.698 --> 00:14:43.338]  are your thoughts about what we should expect this evening?
[00:14:43.338 --> 00:14:50.377]   Okay, I'll take it instead because, you know, I was watching the Alex Jones show
[00:14:50.377 --> 00:14:57.057]   earlier today and he said a bunch of things that I hadn't really thought of
[00:14:58.057 --> 00:15:03.839]  I thought of, you know, one or two things that he mentioned, but not the entire culmination of all the ways that they can cheat.
[00:15:03.879 --> 00:15:24.686]   He showed this clip from yesterday of CNN explaining how the muting is going to work for the microphones, and it's very obvious that not only are they going to disproportionately mute Donald Trump when he tries to interject or interrupt one of his most famous debate tactics from some of his best moments in the history of all of his debates going all the way back to the primary of 2016.
[00:15:25.606 --> 00:15:37.092]   But Alex mentioned something I thought was very insightful and that is that they're gonna have his microphone Sounding muffled and jarbled and just slightly lower in volume than Joe Biden's.
[00:15:37.232 --> 00:15:48.619]  So Joe Biden can sound crisp and coherent with all of his consonants and articulation as crisp as possible while they're going to try to make Donald Trump sound muffled and weaker.
[00:15:49.481 --> 00:16:02.473]  And I was hearing reports today, I don't know if these are confirmed or not, that there's going to be a one to two minute delay time when the industry standard for live broadcast television is just seven seconds of delay time.
[00:16:02.933 --> 00:16:26.025]   And so in the event that, God forbid, either of them collapses or Joe Biden does something incredibly embarrassing, which I find very likely, It's going to be very interesting to see if all of a sudden this broadcast stream cuts off or goes to some splash screen or still image or b-roll or there's some notice on the screen that they're having connection issues.
[00:16:26.526 --> 00:16:47.797]   And I know that several journalists have petitioned to try to have access in the studio so they could document, record and Film what's going on, but I believe CNN has been incredibly difficult about this because for some reason Joe Biden doesn't want anybody in there and they want to make sure that there's this safety net for Joe Biden in the event that he does something incredibly embarrassing.
[00:16:48.078 --> 00:16:59.723]  Now one of the things that I don't think CNN anticipated was that some of their strategies to rig this debate are very likely to backfire.
[00:17:00.563 --> 00:17:04.891]   So if you remember the debates from 2020, Donald Trump did fair.
[00:17:04.911 --> 00:17:05.972]  It wasn't his best performance.
[00:17:05.992 --> 00:17:07.793]  He did better in one than the other.
[00:17:08.854 --> 00:17:11.916]  But one of the criticisms was that he spoke over Joe Biden so much.
[00:17:11.936 --> 00:17:17.060]  And there was that famous moment where Joe Biden responded and said, I want you to just shut up or something to that effect.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:23.065]  And it was just like an epic moment of total rude behavior and unprecedented behavior from Biden.
[00:17:24.398 --> 00:17:35.185]  And I think one of the reasons that Donald Trump didn't perform as well in those debates as he could have is because he didn't let Joe Biden walk himself into a grave in those debates.
[00:17:35.525 --> 00:17:40.876]   We know that the longer that Joe Biden speaks, The more likely he is to gaffe and make mistakes.
[00:17:40.916 --> 00:17:44.979]  We know that when he does press conferences, he's only up there for a couple of minutes at a time.
[00:17:45.019 --> 00:17:46.580]  He barely ever takes any questions.
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.321]  If he does take questions, there's no cards.
[00:17:48.701 --> 00:17:54.065]  We know that his administration and his campaign have done everything in their power to keep everything short and sweet.
[00:17:54.085 --> 00:18:01.348]   I mean, the last long-form speech or appearance that Joe Biden even had, I believe, was the State of the
[00:18:01.348 --> 00:18:01.988]  Union address.
[00:18:01.988 --> 00:18:05.668]   And it was very obvious that he was all hopped up on Adderall or some sort of amphetamines
[00:18:05.668 --> 00:18:07.588]  or uppers to get him through that.
[00:18:07.588 --> 00:18:10.429]  And even by the end, he seemed to be dwindling.
[00:18:10.429 --> 00:18:17.648]   So I anticipate that in the event that CNN attempts to rig this debate tonight by muting
[00:18:17.648 --> 00:18:22.427]   Donald Trump's microphone, lowering his microphone, making it impossible for Trump to interject
[00:18:22.427 --> 00:18:27.709]   with his traditional onage that we would see from him in a debate like this against a bumbling
[00:18:27.709 --> 00:18:29.228]  fool that is Joe Biden.
[00:18:29.228 --> 00:18:39.228]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:18:30.294 --> 00:18:32.336]  That means that Joe Biden is going to have to fill the airtime.
[00:18:32.356 --> 00:18:36.359]  I mean, the less Donald Trump speaks, the more Joe Biden is going to have to speak.
[00:18:36.399 --> 00:18:39.942]  That seems to me like an incredible vulnerability.
[00:18:40.746 --> 00:18:43.688]  In terms of this attempt that they're making to rig the election.
[00:18:43.708 --> 00:18:58.380]  I think what we're seeing here manifest from the mainstream media is they have told so many lies so incessantly for such a long period of time that they themselves have begun to believe their own lies.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.703]  So they've lied repeatedly, incessantly.
[00:19:02.945 --> 00:19:17.036]  Regarding the cognitive ability of Joe Biden, regarding all of his policies, the state of the economy, and basically everything about this administration, this failure of a regime that it is, has been propped up by lies incessantly by the corporate media.
[00:19:17.557 --> 00:19:29.106]  And I think they have begun to believe their own lies to such an extent that they don't even realize the incredible vulnerability of their strategy of allowing Joe Biden to speak uninterrupted for an hour and a half.
[00:19:29.126 --> 00:19:30.167]  Harrison, what do you think about this?
[00:19:31.292 --> 00:19:32.113]  I think you're exactly right.
[00:19:32.153 --> 00:19:34.356]  In fact, that was in one of my predictions.
[00:19:34.376 --> 00:19:37.300]  I put some predictions out on Twitter and that was one of them.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.565]  That Biden's not going to be able to fill the two minutes.
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.641]  That he's been allotted to speak.
[00:19:43.701 --> 00:19:47.343]  And I also wonder, we know that the candidates' mics are going to be muted.
[00:19:47.443 --> 00:19:49.705]  Are the moderators' mics ever going to be muted?
[00:19:49.725 --> 00:19:54.207]  Because I'm wondering how often they'll be interrupting to fact-check Donald Trump.
[00:19:54.648 --> 00:19:57.289]  But yeah, look, I'm desperate.
[00:19:57.369 --> 00:20:01.071]  I really want and what we need as a nation now is 2016 Donald Trump.
[00:20:03.061 --> 00:20:15.284]  And I was just watching some clips from back in the day, some of those first literally world-changing events, these debates where he is just, you know, where he destroyed the Bush family, where he said that there are no weapons of mass destruction.
[00:20:15.324 --> 00:20:18.704]  I mean, just really watershed moments in American history.
[00:20:19.384 --> 00:20:24.786]  And, you know, some of the best moments, he wasn't talking, he was making faces at what the other candidate was saying.
[00:20:24.846 --> 00:20:29.688]   So I'm hoping we get some classic Face crime from Donald Trump.
[00:20:29.848 --> 00:20:31.969]  Some hilarious faces while he's muted.
[00:20:31.989 --> 00:20:34.390]  I hope they keep the camera on him, but I doubt they will.
[00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:37.312]  It's bizarre how much they're locking this whole thing down.
[00:20:37.412 --> 00:20:39.233]  I mean, they're doing everything they can.
[00:20:39.273 --> 00:20:44.756]  They are desperate to get any advantage that they can out of the setup, but it's not gonna help.
[00:20:44.836 --> 00:20:53.892]   I mean, Joe Biden's mic can sound as crisp as a fresh $1 bill, but What he's saying is going to be mumbly nonsense.
[00:20:54.112 --> 00:20:59.115]  So they've tried all of the tricks and their desperation is palpable.
[00:20:59.555 --> 00:21:03.497]  I can feel their anxiety from here.
[00:21:03.597 --> 00:21:13.941]   The Biden inner circle must be just in complete panic meltdown and or zonked out on Xanax right now because It's not going to go well.
[00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:17.444]  My prediction is it's going to be a fun time for Donald Trump.
[00:21:17.504 --> 00:21:17.784]  I hope.
[00:21:18.144 --> 00:21:18.545]  I really do.
[00:21:18.785 --> 00:21:24.089]  First of all, kudos to you for doing three hours of the war room and then staying in the chair for this analysis.
[00:21:24.509 --> 00:21:26.551]  It's awesome to be on air with both of you guys.
[00:21:26.611 --> 00:21:27.752]  It's always an honor and a pleasure.
[00:21:28.132 --> 00:21:30.494]  What are your thoughts, predictions about what's going to happen here tonight?
[00:21:31.917 --> 00:21:34.000]  Well, there's some breaking news right now.
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:41.628]  Biden has arrived at the venue and conspiracy theories are already flying as he looks very strange.
[00:21:41.809 --> 00:21:42.730]  We'll just leave it at that.
[00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:44.832]  But, you know, Biden always looks strange.
[00:21:45.052 --> 00:21:46.954]  So take from that what you will.
[00:21:46.974 --> 00:21:48.596]  But Biden has arrived.
[00:21:48.676 --> 00:21:50.258]  Images are going out of him there.
[00:21:51.139 --> 00:21:52.941]  And he does seem to be a bit aloof.
[00:21:53.381 --> 00:22:01.329]  So you wonder when they're going to hit him with the edibles or injectables or, you know, whatever they got for him to be able to make it 90 minutes.
[00:22:01.489 --> 00:22:10.937]  Also, CNN has just made a public statement in regards to the two minute delay, and they've claimed that there is no two minute delay.
[00:22:11.238 --> 00:22:14.100]  They've denied it and called it a conspiracy theory.
[00:22:14.721 --> 00:22:21.774]   But just to kind of hone in on What this really means, as you said, the industry standard is seven seconds.
[00:22:22.014 --> 00:22:24.715]  That's the industry standard for radio and television.
[00:22:25.136 --> 00:22:27.997]  Now, some people have more than that for whatever reason.
[00:22:28.037 --> 00:22:37.223]  I know we have more than that here in case people curse on the air or, you know, we put a gay pride parade up and some men start sodomizing each other, you know, naked in the streets.
[00:22:37.791 --> 00:22:39.092]  So we have a little bit more.
[00:22:40.112 --> 00:22:49.296]  Even NFL games, NBA games will usually have an extended delay as well because guys will, you know, drop N-bombs and F-bombs that they need to censor off of the network feed as well.
[00:22:50.317 --> 00:22:52.818]  But these are all reasons that make sense.
[00:22:53.038 --> 00:22:56.420]  Why CNN would want a two-minute delay doesn't make sense.
[00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:59.561]  Now, maybe it was just conspiracy theory.
[00:22:59.601 --> 00:23:01.682]  Maybe, of course, they're just saying that because it's true.
[00:23:02.122 --> 00:23:03.202]  Maybe we'll find out tonight.
[00:23:03.342 --> 00:23:03.823]  I don't know.
[00:23:04.223 --> 00:23:20.289]  Either way, Donald Trump, I believe, needs to have a live recording device on his person when this is going on to make sure they don't pull any shenanigans like that and they don't edit any Biden slurs or bumbles or him forgetting where he's at or toots out of the live feed.
[00:23:20.769 --> 00:23:23.790]  So, I would say Trump definitely, but they'll probably pat him down.
[00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:26.393]  And make sure that he can't even do that.
[00:23:26.593 --> 00:23:27.854]  That's how serious this is.
[00:23:28.455 --> 00:23:31.499]  But there's obviously a level of control here that we've never seen before.
[00:23:31.519 --> 00:23:31.579]  One...
[00:23:33.203 --> 00:23:38.726]  Every other presidential debate has been run by the Presidential Debate Commission, which is a non-profit.
[00:23:39.106 --> 00:23:43.008]  And that's why it's considered free and fair use for anybody to do live coverage.
[00:23:43.048 --> 00:23:54.094]  Well, this is the first time in modern American history, if not maybe all of American history, where a debate, a presidential debate, is actually owned by a private corporation, that being CNN.
[00:23:54.514 --> 00:23:57.436]  And so that's why they're cracking down on any live coverage of this.
[00:23:57.836 --> 00:24:05.254]   I would suspect a big story to emerge here I think YouTube is probably going to cooperate censoring this on channels.
[00:24:05.775 --> 00:24:07.055]  Facebook as well.
[00:24:07.855 --> 00:24:10.797]  We'll see about X. We'll see about Rumble.
[00:24:11.697 --> 00:24:18.179]  But I would have suspected any independent or alternative news organizations that try to do live coverage of this on those platforms.
[00:24:18.279 --> 00:24:19.980]  I could see them getting shut down.
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:21.341]  Maybe hit with a strike.
[00:24:21.441 --> 00:24:22.061]  I don't know.
[00:24:22.781 --> 00:24:27.903]  So let's see how much control they really want over this as the first privately owned debate.
[00:24:27.983 --> 00:24:28.863]  I mean, think about that.
[00:24:28.923 --> 00:24:30.244]  This is a presidential debate.
[00:24:31.007 --> 00:24:40.516]  This should be for the American people, and CNN is saying, no, this is for us, and you have to not show it, or are they going to get litigious?
[00:24:40.736 --> 00:24:41.997]  I mean, what are we talking about here?
[00:24:42.337 --> 00:24:45.420]  Is there going to be lawsuits flying for people that air this?
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:49.484]  So this is kind of an unknown factor outside of just the realm of the debate.
[00:24:49.524 --> 00:24:52.506]  Now, here's the other control factor that is just incredible here.
[00:24:53.127 --> 00:25:01.661]   It's my understanding there's only going to be four people in the room Aside, I guess, from the camera persons, but they might be remote.
[00:25:01.721 --> 00:25:04.002]  They might just be in the back running the cameras.
[00:25:04.462 --> 00:25:15.347]  So we're talking about Joe Biden and Donald Trump on the stage, and then the two debate moderators there off the stage, and they're saying no journalists are allowed in, no spectators are allowed in.
[00:25:15.827 --> 00:25:21.469]  CNN did allow one print journalist to come in in a commercial break, in a commercial break.
[00:25:22.029 --> 00:25:25.330]  So is this all to protect Joe Biden from getting confused?
[00:25:25.851 --> 00:25:36.434]  Is this to protect Joe Biden in case he does slur or mutter some nonsensical gibberish that they can delay out of it and nobody will be there to notice?
[00:25:37.935 --> 00:25:42.737]  I mean, this is something like you've never seen or heard of before in a presidential debate.
[00:25:42.857 --> 00:25:49.111]   But I think my theory with this is What happens when you have a three-on-one situation?
[00:25:49.171 --> 00:25:51.453]  What happens when you have an underdog?
[00:25:51.553 --> 00:25:53.193]  That's who people pull for.
[00:25:53.514 --> 00:25:58.036]  That's why Donald Trump pulled ahead of the field when 16 people were against him in the Republican debates.
[00:25:58.476 --> 00:26:06.301]   And I think this three-on-one tag-team Democrat propaganda match against Donald Trump Is gonna work in his favor in some ways.
[00:26:06.701 --> 00:26:18.070]  Now, the issue is gonna be when they call him a felon, when they call him a rapist, when he tries to talk about the Biden crime family and he's got three against one, when he tries to talk about the economy and he's got three against one and they're shutting down his mic.
[00:26:18.531 --> 00:26:21.833]  We'll see how the undecided voter responds to that.
[00:26:22.294 --> 00:26:31.401]  But my intuition, my instincts goes with America likes the underdog, America likes the guy who's three against one and all odds are weighed against him.
[00:26:31.981 --> 00:26:32.442]  Absolutely.
[00:26:32.462 --> 00:26:46.334]  Well, and there's been speculation that this debate being so early and the fact that the DNC has scheduled its convention so late and now it's doing it virtually, there's a lot of speculation amongst conspiracy theorists, myself included.
[00:26:46.354 --> 00:26:49.537]  I think it's a badge of honor at this point to be called a conspiracy theorist.
[00:26:49.577 --> 00:26:56.523]  I mean, it's much better than being called a journalist because the conspiracy theorists seem to get things right more often than the journalists these days, unfortunately.
[00:26:57.023 --> 00:27:11.491]  There's been thinking, thoughts, ideas shared that this might actually be Joe Biden's audition to his own party, his own convention, as to whether or not he will be the candidate that's finally put into this general election cycle.
[00:27:12.032 --> 00:27:19.576]  And I've said before a million times on air that you have to really look at who is publishing books to get a sense or an idea of who's thinking about running.
[00:27:19.916 --> 00:27:31.045]   And I found it very bizarre that Hillary Clinton not only has been showing up in my feed and in public, More frequently over the course of the last several months, but she came out with a book just like yesterday or a couple of days ago.
[00:27:31.506 --> 00:27:36.431]  I wonder if Joe Biden really fails tonight in an embarrassing way.
[00:27:36.451 --> 00:27:41.937]  The Democrats will use that as an excuse to remove him as the candidate and put in Hillary Clinton.
[00:27:41.957 --> 00:27:44.840]   I know people have been talking about Big Mike, Roger Stone has been talking about Big Mike.
[00:27:45.161 --> 00:27:46.742]  Gavin Newsom's a name that's been floated around.
[00:27:46.762 --> 00:27:49.104]  He ran ads in Florida that sort of tests the market there.
[00:27:49.444 --> 00:27:53.768]  But I think Hillary Clinton might actually be a contender because I agree with you, Owen.
[00:27:54.228 --> 00:27:58.292]  The underdog is someone that Americans always root for.
[00:27:58.732 --> 00:28:04.817]  Trump right now is a comeback story, but if they run Hillary Clinton against Trump, that's like a comeback story against a comeback story.
[00:28:04.837 --> 00:28:06.418]  It sort of neutralizes that aspect of it.
[00:28:06.458 --> 00:28:08.760]  Owen, I want to get your thoughts on that, but let's go to Harrison first.
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:09.721]  Harrison, what are your thoughts?
[00:28:09.761 --> 00:28:10.662]  I know it's sort of a curveball.
[00:28:12.263 --> 00:28:13.004]  Well, I don't...
[00:28:14.204 --> 00:28:15.285]  Honestly, I hope they do.
[00:28:15.445 --> 00:28:17.946]  I mean, it would be very funny for her to run again.
[00:28:18.086 --> 00:28:21.927]  But, I mean, she's the most unpopular person in America still.
[00:28:21.987 --> 00:28:26.049]  Nothing's happened over the last eight years to revitalize her public image.
[00:28:26.529 --> 00:28:34.453]  I think it was, you know, maybe she entertained some delusional dream of this, but I honestly just can't see that happening.
[00:28:35.382 --> 00:28:37.863]  Uh, there's a lot of, you know, obviously there's a ton of speculation.
[00:28:38.123 --> 00:28:41.244]  And again, just to emphasize Owen's point, it's so weird what they're doing.
[00:28:41.344 --> 00:28:46.125]  It's so bizarre how many changes they've made for this one particular thing.
[00:28:46.145 --> 00:29:02.355]   And it almost makes me think of like how, uh, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, you know, Spoil anything here, but when the World Wrestling Federation changed from being a sport to sports entertainment, which meant maybe the rules could be changed a little bit.
[00:29:02.375 --> 00:29:03.255]  This is politics entertainment.
[00:29:03.655 --> 00:29:06.137]  Yeah, maybe the outcome could be predetermined.
[00:29:06.618 --> 00:29:13.823]  You know, the fact that this is not a debate by the debating society that's free to air and, you know, a public service, but that it's something for profit.
[00:29:14.683 --> 00:29:21.228]  You know, it's almost like it's something you would do to be able to do things that you wouldn't be able to do otherwise, you know.
[00:29:22.088 --> 00:29:30.110]  I actually had a caller, and I thought it was crazy when I first heard it, but it was a couple days ago, and ever since then I keep being like, that's not today, that can't possibly be true.
[00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:32.211]  But he's been at Camp David for a week preparing.
[00:29:32.791 --> 00:29:36.992]  He's been for an entire week doing nothing but apparently preparing for this debate.
[00:29:38.892 --> 00:29:41.573]  Is it out of the question that maybe they were pre-filming?
[00:29:45.024 --> 00:29:51.304]   stage is now we will actually be seeing broadcasts and instead we'll see, you know, a pre-recorded
[00:29:51.304 --> 00:29:53.223]  thing that makes them sound good.
[00:29:53.223 --> 00:29:57.623]   Because again, why is there nobody else allowed in the studio?
[00:29:57.623 --> 00:29:59.904]  Why the rumors of the one to two minute debate?
[00:29:59.904 --> 00:30:05.743]   And again, you know, the way these people are, take a look at the Russian, Hunter Biden's
[00:30:05.743 --> 00:30:10.304]   laptop and them saying it has all the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation.
[00:30:10.319 --> 00:30:13.021]  Right, they can quantify it so they can walk it back later when it comes out.
[00:30:13.061 --> 00:30:13.841]  Yeah, knowing full well.
[00:30:13.861 --> 00:30:19.725]  So when I see CNN say CNN will not have any delay, you know, it's like, well, will there be a delay though?
[00:30:19.925 --> 00:30:26.249]  You know, maybe CNN doesn't have a delay, but maybe it gets sent to an intermediary transfer system and the delay is put on there.
[00:30:26.269 --> 00:30:28.710]  And so, well, yes, there is a delay, but we're not the ones putting on.
[00:30:29.171 --> 00:30:29.471]  I don't know.
[00:30:29.491 --> 00:30:32.633]  I'm just, there's so many bizarre aspects to this.
[00:30:32.773 --> 00:30:36.215]   It is so unlike any debate That's ever been held before.
[00:30:37.296 --> 00:30:44.542]  And I think it's very reasonable to be asking questions as to why all of these things are being put into place.
[00:30:44.922 --> 00:30:54.249]  I've also heard people who've called into American Journal say, if I was Trump, I wouldn't do this because we know the deep state wants Trump and probably also want Biden out of the way.
[00:30:54.729 --> 00:30:58.753]  Could this be an opportunity for a false flag attack that takes them all out?
[00:30:58.813 --> 00:31:02.535]  And they don't want a bunch of reporters there to tell the truth about what they saw.
[00:31:04.073 --> 00:31:09.857]  I don't think it, you know, I think it's just going to be a weird sort of, you know, faux debate that we're going to see here.
[00:31:09.977 --> 00:31:12.918]  But everybody's sort of spidey senses tingling.
[00:31:12.978 --> 00:31:14.579]  I think that, like, what are they up to?
[00:31:14.719 --> 00:31:15.700]  You know, they're up to something.
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:18.762]  We don't know what yet, but they're clearly up to something.
[00:31:18.782 --> 00:31:26.186]  They're acting very suspiciously for reasons that they don't seem to be explained just by Joe Biden, you know, being bumbling.
[00:31:26.346 --> 00:31:28.668]  Although, you know, there's obviously that and they're not going to be able to call.
[00:31:29.292 --> 00:31:32.414]  Something that we all see live streamed nationally, a cheap fake.
[00:31:32.574 --> 00:31:40.759]  So, you know, they're pulling out all the stops to try to avoid the embarrassment that I feel like we all understand is gonna happen at some point on stage tonight.
[00:31:41.419 --> 00:31:47.163]  Owen, your thoughts on Harrison's comments as well as whether or not this is an audition for Joe Biden to keep his own job.
[00:31:48.331 --> 00:31:54.274]  Well, I hope that they have to walk on the stage and sit down because that alone is going to be difficult for Joe Biden.
[00:31:54.394 --> 00:31:56.655]  And that might be something that they don't even want you to see.
[00:31:56.695 --> 00:32:03.278]  So if they start the broadcast and they're already in their chairs, that shows you how much they're working to protect Joe Biden.
[00:32:03.938 --> 00:32:05.499]  You know, quickly on the Hillary issue.
[00:32:06.505 --> 00:32:09.448]  There's no doubt that that is a bitter, bitter woman.
[00:32:09.908 --> 00:32:16.634]  And she probably has screaming fits of rage in the middle of the night about how they rigged it for Joe but didn't do it for her.
[00:32:16.734 --> 00:32:24.962]  But I think Hillary's revenge has already come in the eventual shutdown of Infowars, in the persecution of Donald Trump.
[00:32:25.322 --> 00:32:26.983]  I think a lot of that is Hillary Clinton's revenge.
[00:32:27.224 --> 00:32:29.686]  Maybe even the imprisonment of Julian Assange.
[00:32:30.206 --> 00:32:34.270]  So I think that was kind of Hillary's revenge where they said, all right, look, you gotta go.
[00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:39.274]  You're a loser now, you're unpopular, but here, we'll give you some parting gifts.
[00:32:39.394 --> 00:32:41.456]  Here, we'll destroy Alex Jones and Infowars for you.
[00:32:41.516 --> 00:32:43.057]  We'll imprison Julian Assange for you.
[00:32:43.077 --> 00:32:45.079]  We'll go after Donald Trump and ruin his life for you.
[00:32:45.499 --> 00:32:49.683]  So just take these parting gifts, but just go, please, just go.
[00:32:50.263 --> 00:32:54.267]  I don't think bringing her back into the fold gives the Democrats any advantages.
[00:32:54.287 --> 00:32:59.738]   Now, as far as Joe Biden is concerned, I don't think it's necessarily a tryout.
[00:33:00.779 --> 00:33:03.841]  I think that it's more of, can he do it?
[00:33:04.782 --> 00:33:05.642]  Can he do it?
[00:33:06.202 --> 00:33:09.925]  This is the earliest a presidential debate has ever happened in American history.
[00:33:10.507 --> 00:33:21.530]  And so I think it is a test more of a can he do it than anything else, or I think the outlying, I think the real outlier here is not that they did they pre-record stuff.
[00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:25.411]  I think that's, I mean, it's not impossible, but it's virtually implausible.
[00:33:25.591 --> 00:33:27.791]  I've seen how TV works behind the scenes.
[00:33:27.851 --> 00:33:32.112]  To pull something like that off would be extremely difficult without anybody noticing.
[00:33:32.852 --> 00:33:35.493]  And you also have at least probably 16 people in there.
[00:33:35.513 --> 00:33:42.320]   I mean, I guess 16 people at CNN would go along for a fake like that, but it seems to me That's a virtual impossibility.
[00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:45.842]  A false flag, again, seems to me like a virtual impossibility.
[00:33:46.322 --> 00:33:49.323]  I think what's more likely as an outlying scenario is...
[00:33:51.112 --> 00:33:53.174]  Could they be sabotaging Joe Biden?
[00:33:53.254 --> 00:33:59.699]  Could they use this as the opportunity to sabotage Joe Biden and then just be like, oh my gosh, well, this was a disaster.
[00:34:00.019 --> 00:34:03.862]  And then they can run fake news stories and say, Biden's poll numbers plummet.
[00:34:03.902 --> 00:34:09.607]  Biden loses 12 points in Michigan and 10 points in Wisconsin and eight points in Georgia.
[00:34:09.967 --> 00:34:12.049]  And then it's like, okay, well, we've got to go.
[00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:15.292]  And then he can come out and make a nice statement and say, yeah, I've got to step aside.
[00:34:16.012 --> 00:34:18.853]  They'll have to deal with Kamala Harris getting skipped over.
[00:34:18.873 --> 00:34:22.314]  I guess the only way they can pull that off is with a Michelle Obama.
[00:34:22.354 --> 00:34:24.494]  How else can you skip over a woman of color like that?
[00:34:24.534 --> 00:34:26.135]  You'd obviously be a racist bigot.
[00:34:26.195 --> 00:34:35.817]  So, the bottom line is the Democrats have a lot of issues, and all they have is cheap tactics, like whatever they're going to pull tonight at the debate.
[00:34:36.477 --> 00:34:43.819]  So, here's the amazing thing coming into this, and this tends to get kind of forgotten by the American people because this campaign has been so insane.
[00:34:45.390 --> 00:34:48.431]  Joe Biden is the worst part of his campaign.
[00:34:48.831 --> 00:34:50.652]  He's the guy running for president.
[00:34:51.132 --> 00:34:52.572]  He's the president of the United States.
[00:34:52.612 --> 00:34:54.073]  He needs a week to prepare for a debate.
[00:34:54.473 --> 00:34:59.774]  He's the virtual nominee at this point, and he's their weakest point.
[00:34:59.994 --> 00:35:01.495]  He's his weakest point!
[00:35:02.196 --> 00:35:09.623]  So, I mean, to think about that is really a strange phenomenon that this is what they're moving forward with.
[00:35:10.043 --> 00:35:12.425]  But he is the easiest to control.
[00:35:12.445 --> 00:35:14.207]  He was just gone for a week.
[00:35:14.487 --> 00:35:16.349]  And who knows what went on at the White House?
[00:35:16.909 --> 00:35:18.591]  You know, foreign policy, whatever.
[00:35:18.691 --> 00:35:19.512]  It doesn't even matter.
[00:35:20.032 --> 00:35:21.794]  So they kind of like Joe in that regard.
[00:35:22.094 --> 00:35:25.437]  Obama can basically run things behind the scenes if that's really what's going on.
[00:35:26.017 --> 00:35:28.218]  So it's like, that's the stuff they like about Joe?
[00:35:28.618 --> 00:35:41.020]  He's blackmailable, he's controllable, he doesn't know what's going on, but then there's also the aspect of, well this is kind of an embarrassment for the Democrat Party, and nobody even believes that he's running the office, so it's kind of a tit-for-tat.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.001]  But these are the stories going into debate.
[00:35:43.221 --> 00:35:52.103]  Notice how we're not talking about policy on the border, we're not talking about policy on the economy, we're not talking about taxes, and by the way, nobody is!
[00:35:52.843 --> 00:35:58.425]  Everybody's talking about how they're gonna rig the debate against Trump, and what stunts they're gonna pull to protect Joe Biden.
[00:35:59.146 --> 00:36:00.706]  Yeah, that's absolutely right.
[00:36:01.167 --> 00:36:02.147]  Fascinating input there.
[00:36:02.187 --> 00:36:07.149]  And we did show some footage of Joe Biden arriving at the debate.
[00:36:07.329 --> 00:36:10.691]  He has landed, he has shown up, and he looks awful in this footage.
[00:36:10.711 --> 00:36:12.071]  And I'm not just saying that as a cheap shot.
[00:36:12.251 --> 00:36:20.595]   Obviously, this audience knows that I despise Joe Biden at my core, but I despise him for reasons Beyond cheap shots, okay?
[00:36:20.615 --> 00:36:22.256]  I can criticize him all day for legitimate reasons.
[00:36:22.276 --> 00:36:26.258]  He looks like he's been injected with like maple wood or something.
[00:36:26.278 --> 00:36:31.921]  I mean, the guy looks positively robotic, like Pinocchio, you know, only without WD-40.
[00:36:31.981 --> 00:36:33.101]  So, we're seeing this.
[00:36:33.121 --> 00:36:40.365]  And then we have reports here that Gavin Newsom is spotted in the spin room of the CNN Atlanta, Georgia debate to help Biden.
[00:36:40.825 --> 00:36:45.308]  So, it's bizarre that Gavin Newsom is showing up and helping out and participating in this.
[00:36:46.164 --> 00:36:47.105]  You know, you mentioned a good point.
[00:36:47.345 --> 00:36:52.708]  We're not talking about any of the issues or the failures of this regime or this administration.
[00:36:52.948 --> 00:36:54.589]  We're talking about how rigged this debate is.
[00:36:54.629 --> 00:36:55.750]  It's very obvious it's rigged.
[00:36:55.790 --> 00:37:01.053]  CNN was famous for leaking the questions in the last election cycle, and then now they're privately running this debate.
[00:37:01.093 --> 00:37:01.953]  I mean, what do we expect?
[00:37:01.973 --> 00:37:06.636]  There was some major internal change for no reason at CNN, and suddenly they want to do things honestly?
[00:37:06.756 --> 00:37:07.096]  Please.
[00:37:07.417 --> 00:37:11.639]  I mean, ever since Project Mockingbird, all these mainstream media outlets have been problematic.
[00:37:11.679 --> 00:37:16.977]   But I want to ask you, Harrison, Let's just do an exercise, and this is a counterintuitive exercise for both you guys.
[00:37:16.997 --> 00:37:19.139]  I want both you guys to think about this.
[00:37:19.319 --> 00:37:30.470]  How could Joe Biden, other than the rigging, other than obviously the tricks of CNN, how could Joe Biden successfully walk away appearing victorious in this debate?
[00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:38.538]   I mean, how could we arrive at a place mentally, psychologically tomorrow when we're on air here on InfoWars, we're like, wow, Joe Biden actually won that debate.
[00:37:38.558 --> 00:37:39.538]  It's a shame he shouldn't have.
[00:37:40.198 --> 00:37:42.859]  What would he have to do to actually win?
[00:37:43.219 --> 00:37:49.341]  Does he have an avenue or a road or a path where a reasonable person could come out and beat Trump in a debate like this?
[00:37:49.401 --> 00:37:50.922]  It just seems almost impossible to me.
[00:37:50.962 --> 00:37:51.622]  Harrison, your thoughts?
[00:37:52.282 --> 00:37:56.283]  Well, maybe that's the double-edged sword of having such low expectations for Biden.
[00:37:57.004 --> 00:38:03.768]   To be honest with you, and again this is from my prediction earlier today, I think Biden's going to do better than we expect.
[00:38:04.289 --> 00:38:16.223]  I think, you know, from what you see on a daily, on a literally daily basis, every time he goes outside or is in front of a camera, it's embarrassing, it's stumbling, it's mumbling, it's just bad.
[00:38:16.263 --> 00:38:22.050]  And so, you know, we never really see a 30 second stretch without him completely embarrassing himself and the country.
[00:38:23.141 --> 00:38:25.081]  I think he's going to do better than that.
[00:38:25.142 --> 00:38:27.102]  I think he's still going to mumble, he's still going to bumble.
[00:38:27.142 --> 00:38:32.683]  There's still going to be times where he's halfway through a sentence and says, wow, anyway, and goes off, you know, elsewhere.
[00:38:33.503 --> 00:38:43.046]  I'm not saying he's going to, you know, knock our socks off, but I wouldn't be surprised if he, you know, keeps it together and says all of the talking points we expect him to say.
[00:38:43.086 --> 00:38:44.806]  He'll probably blame Trump for the border.
[00:38:44.966 --> 00:38:46.747]  He'll take credit for the economy.
[00:38:47.187 --> 00:38:50.047]  He'll talk about COVID and the job losses.
[00:38:50.087 --> 00:38:52.228]  He'll call Trump a convicted felon, a whole bunch.
[00:38:53.008 --> 00:39:03.377]  He's not going to say anything that's going to blow our mind or, you know, say any policy that we haven't heard a thousand times and isn't, you know, obviously detrimental to the overall well-being of American citizens.
[00:39:03.657 --> 00:39:04.859]  I'm not expecting anything like that.
[00:39:05.319 --> 00:39:11.064]  But, you know, I wouldn't be surprised if he just spouts off the talking points and acts brash.
[00:39:11.124 --> 00:39:21.754]   And I mean, we know we know Biden is sort of, you know, everybody gets now he's not very secretly and I don't want to curse, but A jerk.
[00:39:21.774 --> 00:39:22.875]  He's just, he's a jerk.
[00:39:22.915 --> 00:39:29.920]  He's, you know, anytime anybody interrupts him or anything, he's, he's got a habit of getting very vicious, very quickly.
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:31.201]  He's probably going to pull some of that out.
[00:39:31.501 --> 00:39:34.743]  And, you know, these people equate meanness with strength.
[00:39:34.783 --> 00:39:37.465]  So he's going to try to project strength and he's going to be mean to Donald Trump.
[00:39:38.205 --> 00:39:43.969]  And, you know, I think it's up to Trump really here to blow Joe Biden out of the water.
[00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:48.372]  I don't think that, I think the expectations for Joe are so low.
[00:39:48.412 --> 00:39:50.434]  Everybody's going to be amazed if he just makes it through the debate.
[00:39:51.156 --> 00:40:07.525]  And, you know, if Trump just sort of says the stuff, the same stuff he's been saying forever and doesn't have any good one-liners, doesn't have any zingers, he's not allowed to, you know, do the little comebacks that he had that he was so famous for in previous debates, whether it's Hillary Clinton, that's why you'd be in jail, or Jeb Bush talking about his mom saying she should be running.
[00:40:07.585 --> 00:40:08.905]  I mean... He should bring a megaphone.
[00:40:10.026 --> 00:40:12.647]  He should bring a megaphone or... I think Owen's right.
[00:40:12.687 --> 00:40:13.708]  He should be recording this.
[00:40:13.748 --> 00:40:15.769]  He should have a little recording device.
[00:40:16.329 --> 00:40:34.044]   And I don't think they're going to pat him down because, you know, I wonder if Joe Biden doesn't have some, you know, an IV bag secreted somewhere on his person that's, you know, feeding him whatever Adderall concoction that's keeping him awake right now, or, you know, braces on his legs to make sure he doesn't fall over.
[00:40:34.064 --> 00:40:35.344]  I don't think they're going to pass these guys down.
[00:40:35.364 --> 00:40:40.427]  We did notice a large order of Brain Force Ultra sent straight to him recently, so maybe that's part of it.
[00:40:40.447 --> 00:40:41.387]  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
[00:40:41.407 --> 00:40:43.308]  Yeah, wow, we never shipped there before.
[00:40:43.328 --> 00:40:44.129]  This is amazing.
[00:40:44.409 --> 00:40:48.030]  Owen, your thoughts on whether or not Joe Biden has a legitimate path to victory?
[00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:49.091]  Let me put it to you like this.
[00:40:49.671 --> 00:40:56.174]  If you were debating Donald Trump, and I know this is a difficult question to ask you because obviously we support Donald Trump here, I think, unilaterally.
[00:40:56.774 --> 00:41:02.617]  If you were going to be debating Donald Trump tonight, what approach would you take if you wanted to win the debate?
[00:41:02.897 --> 00:41:07.359]  And I know that's a tough question to answer because we agree with him, but how could Joe possibly win this?
[00:41:08.433 --> 00:41:09.153]  Well, it's very simple.
[00:41:09.453 --> 00:41:10.254]  You rigged the match.
[00:41:10.614 --> 00:41:11.214]  I mean, that's it.
[00:41:11.254 --> 00:41:12.835]  You just completely rigged the debate.
[00:41:12.895 --> 00:41:17.957]  It's like Stone Cold Steve Austin against Vince McMahon, Shane McMahon, and The Undertaker.
[00:41:18.277 --> 00:41:20.718]  And he has to have his hand tied behind his back.
[00:41:20.838 --> 00:41:23.079]  I mean, that's basically what Trump is walking into.
[00:41:24.099 --> 00:41:27.560]  But I can answer that and expand on what Harrison was just talking about.
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:29.641]  I think the reality of the situation is this.
[00:41:30.541 --> 00:41:31.802]  Biden was away for a week.
[00:41:32.532 --> 00:41:37.798]  Practicing for this debate, and maybe they're working with a cocktail of drugs or doing a blood transfusion.
[00:41:37.818 --> 00:41:43.123]  I mean, all health speculation aside, they're obviously going to do something to try to have him up and ready for this.
[00:41:44.164 --> 00:42:12.460]   But I think what just happened for the last week was they were practicing He obviously got the questions, so he knows the questions he's gonna be asked, and he's probably rehearsed his response for the exact time window, whatever that time window is, he's rehearsed his response to fill the exact time window, probably a dozen times, 50 times, whatever, so that he knows what he's gonna say, he knows how he's gonna say it, when he's gonna say it, he's gonna fill his time, and it's gonna be as less awkward as it possibly can be.
[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:20.831]   And I also think He's probably been been training on how to keep talking with someone else talking next to him.
[00:42:22.153 --> 00:42:25.596]  So my guess is they're expecting Trump to talk while Biden is talking.
[00:42:25.636 --> 00:42:28.799]  That's why CNN did that whole mic routine where they showed you what they're going to do.
[00:42:29.299 --> 00:42:37.767]  So my guess is he's been he's been training and practicing on continuing to rehearse his lines even while Trump is talking beside him.
[00:42:38.719 --> 00:42:43.643]  So I think that that's kind of their strategy here, is to just have Biden's canned responses ready.
[00:42:43.703 --> 00:42:52.150]  He knows the questions, he has his canned responses, and he's been training to just keep talking and looking forward, even when somebody is next to him talking.
[00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:54.752]  So I think that's kind of the training that they've been going through.
[00:42:56.113 --> 00:42:58.435]  I think that the moderators are kind of a safety net.
[00:42:59.096 --> 00:43:06.762]  If Biden does get flummoxed or something happens, then they can kind of come to the rescue and make it look as less awkward as they can for Joe.
[00:43:07.783 --> 00:43:09.553]  But I think when it's gonna get obvious...
[00:43:10.621 --> 00:43:18.566]  Is when they all start piling on, you're a felon, you're a convicted rapist, whatever it is, you know, oh, the economy is better under Joe.
[00:43:18.907 --> 00:43:21.048]  So I think that's when the pile on is going to happen.
[00:43:21.448 --> 00:43:25.071]  But I think the Democrat strategy is, OK, Joe, here's the questions.
[00:43:25.571 --> 00:43:26.492]  Here's your answers.
[00:43:26.972 --> 00:43:30.694]  Say them to us in this practice facility a hundred times.
[00:43:31.215 --> 00:43:32.696]  We're going to have a guy talking over here.
[00:43:32.816 --> 00:43:35.718]  Just keep looking forward, ignore him and just do that.
[00:43:35.758 --> 00:43:36.938]  So I think that's their strategy.
[00:43:36.958 --> 00:43:39.060]  I think that's why Joe Biden was gone for the last week.
[00:43:39.981 --> 00:43:51.376]  Again, you know, whatever speculations we make on what they're doing to get him jacked up, you know, a pump on him, like an insulin pump into his veins, something inside of his body that'll trigger in 30 minutes or something, I don't know.
[00:43:52.217 --> 00:43:53.459]  He's got nerve link.
[00:43:53.719 --> 00:43:54.340]  He's all hooked up.
[00:43:55.302 --> 00:43:55.622]  Maybe.
[00:43:56.123 --> 00:43:57.444]  Who really knows with Joe anymore?
[00:43:57.644 --> 00:44:00.065]  But I think that's what this time away has really been about.
[00:44:00.125 --> 00:44:09.291]  Just training him to get his canned answers and to be able to talk coherently even though Trump's probably going to be speaking alongside of him with his mic shut off.
[00:44:09.732 --> 00:44:10.032]  Absolutely.
[00:44:10.052 --> 00:44:12.674]  You know, that's a vulnerability that I hadn't really considered.
[00:44:12.954 --> 00:44:46.391]   The fact that it will be incredibly awkward to hear somebody right next to him arguing or rebutting him into his ear that the audience cannot hear and then not respond or get distracted by that because if he makes the mistake of talking back or responding to Trump even if his response is clever or some sort of a good comeback nobody's gonna know what Trump said so it's just gonna look like this bumbling fool who's like totally unaware of what the audience is hearing I mean that's that's a major vulnerability that that could blow back as well I do want to remind the audience that Alex Jones is going to be joining us live on the air within the next 30 minutes or so so
[00:44:46.411 --> 00:44:47.531]  So please stay tuned.
[00:44:47.551 --> 00:44:50.432]  We've got Robert Barnes and Roger Stone joining us throughout the night.
[00:44:50.472 --> 00:44:55.794]  We are going to be covering the debate, showing the debate live when it happens as well on this broadcast.
[00:44:55.874 --> 00:45:05.378]  So this is the best place to watch this debate tonight, whether you're on InfoWars.com forward slash show, our Rumble account, or our X account at realexjones or at InfoWars.
[00:45:05.638 --> 00:45:12.240]  Please stay tuned and watch the debate tonight here and stay tuned for Alex Jones, who is coming in studio imminently.
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:16.403]  Now I want to move on to questions of the vice presidential candidate.
[00:45:16.463 --> 00:45:22.228]  Obviously it's been a major topic of conversation as to who Donald Trump will pick as the VP.
[00:45:22.589 --> 00:45:39.300]   There are rumors, I don't know if this came directly from the Trump campaign or if this is just something that's been discussed, so forgive me you guys will probably both know better than I do, that his VP pick is known, he has made a decision, and that that person is going to be present in some capacity capacity tonight, I know there's no studio audience, what
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:44.011]   are your thoughts Harrison on this whole VP situation, who it's gonna be,
[00:45:44.011 --> 00:45:49.041]   what he should be taking into consideration making this decision, and how the VP
[00:45:49.041 --> 00:45:53.891]   pick will impact the dynamic between the two candidates, the two campaigns as
[00:45:53.891 --> 00:45:59.360]   they run against each other into the fall. You know, watching some of the
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:04.131]   breakdowns about VP candidates and their strengths and weaknesses, what they
[00:46:04.131 --> 00:46:08.441]   can bring to the table. It all kind of falls flat to me.
[00:46:08.307 --> 00:46:09.067]  Maybe I'm an outlier here.
[00:46:09.087 --> 00:46:11.148]  I'll ask you guys if you think the same way.
[00:46:11.948 --> 00:46:16.549]  Obviously, the VP pick is the most important decision a presidential candidate makes.
[00:46:17.129 --> 00:46:22.650]  And to me, it represents their ability to make these decisions and what their priority is.
[00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:26.491]  You know, I remember John McCain choosing Sarah Palin.
[00:46:26.731 --> 00:46:29.971]  It was like such a, to me, it was such like an irresponsible thing.
[00:46:30.011 --> 00:46:34.272]  It was like, okay, clearly you're pandering, clearly you're picking her because she's a woman and you want the woman vote.
[00:46:34.332 --> 00:46:37.788]   And it's like, This woman's going to be a heartbeat away from the presidency.
[00:46:37.848 --> 00:46:46.511]  When you're picking the vice president, the only thing you should be considering is who would be the best person to run the country should I pass away.
[00:46:46.551 --> 00:46:47.751]  And Donald Trump's an old man.
[00:46:48.051 --> 00:46:49.532]  That should be the overriding concern.
[00:46:50.132 --> 00:46:55.151]   It's sort of just like I just don't like it when I was watching Rudy Giuliani and he was going, well, J.D.
[00:46:55.211 --> 00:46:59.194]  Vance is good, but we're already pretty good in Ohio, so we don't need any Ohio help there.
[00:46:59.214 --> 00:47:00.255]  And this person's good.
[00:47:00.595 --> 00:47:05.219]  And it's like you're choosing a person based on like getting states to see a little bit more.
[00:47:05.599 --> 00:47:07.601]  And to me, that's that just seems irresponsible.
[00:47:07.761 --> 00:47:14.726]  If you're running for president, you need to show us that your only overriding concern is the stability and success.
[00:47:15.747 --> 00:47:22.271]  America and if something were to happen to you that you've got somebody in place where that is your concern and they've proven themselves.
[00:47:22.771 --> 00:47:30.036]  I think all of the pandering and all of the the gender or race stuff is is just sort of like... It's DEI.
[00:47:30.797 --> 00:47:51.472]   Yeah it's it's not it it's not a serious decision and this is like the major decision that candidates make to signal to the American public you know what their priorities are so I really hope that He chooses somebody that is not a diversity hire, quite frankly, if there's no better way to put it.
[00:47:52.333 --> 00:48:00.738]  I hope he chooses somebody who has executive experience and has proven that they can fill the spot at a moment's notice if it were to come to that.
[00:48:01.278 --> 00:48:01.918]  Owen, your thoughts?
[00:48:02.939 --> 00:48:05.340]  Well, I do think strategy is important.
[00:48:05.801 --> 00:48:11.104]  Maybe not necessarily for winning states, but in this election, certainly for winning votes.
[00:48:12.759 --> 00:48:17.878]   I say this even though it probably is meaningless at this point, but if he went with a Tulsi
[00:48:17.878 --> 00:48:21.398]  Gabbard that would be huge for him as far as getting votes.
[00:48:21.398 --> 00:48:25.277]   So if that was his strategy of, "Oh, I just want to get as many votes as possible," he
[00:48:25.277 --> 00:48:26.277]  would choose Tulsi Gabbard.
[00:48:26.277 --> 00:48:27.358]  Now I'm not expecting that.
[00:48:27.358 --> 00:48:34.438]   I think it's probably down to J.D. Vance, Vivek Ramaswamy, and Ben Carson, maybe Doug
[00:48:34.438 --> 00:48:35.719]  Burgum.
[00:48:35.689 --> 00:48:43.232]  But I think the President's strategy at this point is, I don't want to take away any support in Congress, so that would cross Vance out.
[00:48:43.913 --> 00:48:55.691]   And I think he wants somebody that is either as closely aligned with him politically as possible, or Maybe he is even more hardcore than he is as kind of a life insurance policy.
[00:48:55.731 --> 00:48:57.773]  That might be a Vivek Ramaswamy.
[00:48:57.793 --> 00:49:00.956]  I do believe Ramaswamy has been spotted at the debate.
[00:49:01.697 --> 00:49:05.840]  And so Trump did say his vice presidency nominee would be at the debate.
[00:49:06.301 --> 00:49:21.026]   The one thing that is different, I think, for Trump that shows the value of his vice presidency pick that's so important for his base is His base wants to know he's not going to choose another deep state swamp hack.
[00:49:21.547 --> 00:49:21.848]  Yes.
[00:49:22.108 --> 00:49:25.817]  They want to know he's not going to choose another spineless coward like Mike Pence.
[00:49:26.727 --> 00:49:28.068]  And that's not just about Pence.
[00:49:28.468 --> 00:49:32.551]  That's about a lot of the people he surrounded himself with while he was working in D.C.
[00:49:33.051 --> 00:49:40.916]  So I think he needs to send a message to his base that, hey, I'm going to choose somebody that's a lot more aligned with you guys than is with the swamp.
[00:49:41.337 --> 00:49:44.158]  I mean, Mike Pence, what an embarrassment this guy has turned out to be.
[00:49:44.499 --> 00:49:51.083]  The other day, he was just critical of Julian Assange and attacking Julian Assange.
[00:49:52.013 --> 00:49:53.774]  Wow, talk about a fall from grace.
[00:49:53.814 --> 00:50:04.457]  So you expect something better from Trump as far as something to give him his base a little confidence that, hey, I'm going to surround myself with better people this time.
[00:50:04.477 --> 00:50:08.098]  They're going to be more closely aligned with you than they are with the swamp.
[00:50:08.578 --> 00:50:10.559]  I think Vivek best represents that.
[00:50:11.799 --> 00:50:17.041]  You know, my concern is and I guess the VP can really do whatever he can have whatever role he wants.
[00:50:17.661 --> 00:50:30.210]  But I would like to see Vivek in there, whether it's a vice presidency or something else, and his job is to just drain the swamp, just cut the executive branch, take all the policies that you talked about on your campaign and actually apply them.
[00:50:30.631 --> 00:50:32.512]  So he could do that as vice president.
[00:50:33.533 --> 00:50:34.794]  I guess that is a potential.
[00:50:35.863 --> 00:50:39.906]  I don't know, maybe Trump drops a bomb tonight and just announces it on the stage.
[00:50:40.506 --> 00:50:49.711]  He's usually better at kind of controlling the flow of the narrative and dropping these things when he wants to get attention back to his campaign instead of when it's already there, like on a debate night.
[00:50:50.452 --> 00:50:52.613]  But maybe we will know by the end of the night.
[00:50:53.283 --> 00:50:53.804]  Absolutely.
[00:50:53.924 --> 00:50:55.907]  And Alex Jones is in the studio.
[00:50:55.987 --> 00:51:02.315]  He's not ready to sit in the chair quite yet, but he's going to be coming into the studio right at the top of the hour in 23 minutes.
[00:51:02.455 --> 00:51:03.536]  So make sure you stay tuned.
[00:51:03.556 --> 00:51:08.523]  He is going to come and do amazing pregame analysis for what's going to happen in this debate as well as postgame analysis.
[00:51:09.284 --> 00:51:11.467]  With Owen Schroer, Harrison Smith, and myself.
[00:51:11.487 --> 00:51:17.554]  We're going to be here all night, folks, because we are fighting the InfoWar and InfoWarriors never sleep, just as the enemies never sleep.
[00:51:17.594 --> 00:51:39.887]   The next topic I wanted to go to as it pertains to this debate is there were reports earlier this week, I don't know if either of you saw this, that The Biden campaign is recommending to Biden in the debate strategy, the debate prep, not to rely on his accomplishments as the President of the United States in the debate, but instead to focus more on attacking Trump.
[00:51:40.367 --> 00:51:56.950]   Obviously, there's a major vulnerability in terms of the fact that Donald Trump has not been the President of the United States for the last four years, so attacking him sort of seems like attacking presidential policies from four years ago that no longer pertain to the problems that that Americans are facing and the suffering that they're
[00:51:56.950 --> 00:52:02.571]   enduring on basically every front, namely economic. But at the same time, I agree with you
[00:52:02.571 --> 00:52:07.111]   guys that we're going to hear things like you're a convicted felon. But fact of the matter is, so was
[00:52:07.111 --> 00:52:12.101]   Otto Warmbier. He was convicted too in North Korea when the Biden administration and Barack
[00:52:12.101 --> 00:52:16.651]   Obama refused to get him back from North Korea. And he died as a result of his imprisonment
[00:52:16.651 --> 00:52:21.761]   there. And so just by virtue of being convicted, whether it's in the United States or in
[00:52:21.761 --> 00:52:29.421]   North Korea, is not 100% perfectly correlated to being guilty. And so what are your thoughts, Harrison,
[00:52:29.421 --> 00:52:34.851]   on Biden's strategy of not relying on his own accomplishments or trying to make claims or cite
[00:52:34.851 --> 00:52:35.911]  data about...
[00:52:36.036 --> 00:52:37.217]  The strength of his White House.
[00:52:37.277 --> 00:52:40.480]  What are your thoughts on their strategy to just attack Trump the whole time?
[00:52:40.981 --> 00:52:42.082]  I think that's very smart.
[00:52:42.422 --> 00:52:50.109]  I think it's very smart in that he has no accomplishments to point to and the statistics tell a very dismal story of his administration.
[00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:52.572]  Yeah, I can see the conversation now.
[00:52:52.612 --> 00:52:56.776]  Sir, you might want to avoid talking about your accomplishments because we've run the numbers and there are none.
[00:52:57.216 --> 00:52:57.817]  Yeah, there are none.
[00:52:57.857 --> 00:53:02.783]  No, they're going to roll out the numbers that they, you know, rigged everything to get.
[00:53:02.843 --> 00:53:10.893]  Things like how the economy, the, you know, the unemployment rate was so high when Donald Trump left, obviously because COVID and they forced everybody to shut.
[00:53:11.073 --> 00:53:13.276]  But they're going to, he's going to take credit for the job gains.
[00:53:13.316 --> 00:53:34.545]   They're not going to mention that Every single one of the new jobs created went to illegal immigrants while foreign-born Americans lost hundreds of thousands if not millions of jobs He's not going to point out that the vast majority if not the totality of new jobs created are part-time Whereas the number of full-time jobs has decreased over his time, so you know statistics don't lie the liars use statistics He's gonna use statistics to make himself feel good.
[00:53:35.065 --> 00:53:40.031]   You know look good, but I think that I You're exactly right that they are going to be on the offensive with Trump.
[00:53:40.111 --> 00:53:41.491]  I mean, we know this is their tactic.
[00:53:41.511 --> 00:53:42.992]  They're going to try to keep him on the back foot.
[00:53:43.032 --> 00:53:47.153]  I wouldn't be surprised if the first question was, you know, the first question goes to Trump.
[00:53:47.233 --> 00:53:49.374]  Why should America vote for a convicted felon?
[00:53:49.394 --> 00:53:50.475]  You convicted felon.
[00:53:50.515 --> 00:53:52.575]  You know, it's all going to be Trump is evil.
[00:53:52.595 --> 00:53:53.296]  Trump is bad.
[00:53:53.736 --> 00:54:00.878]  I mean, Biden hasn't given a speech his entire presidency where he hasn't called you and I and everybody listening to us domestic terrorists.
[00:54:00.938 --> 00:54:06.798]   So he's going to try to inflame this this concept of Trump as a dangerous dictator. He's going
[00:54:06.798 --> 00:54:13.208]   to basically make him denied. It's kind of like the clip that's been going viral with the news
[00:54:13.208 --> 00:54:19.007]   reporter in Australia trying to get Tucker to, you know, acknowledge that by you talk
[00:54:19.007 --> 00:54:24.469]   about the great replacement, he's somehow inspiring mass murder, right? That's how all of
[00:54:24.469 --> 00:54:28.659]   their questions are going to be phrased. It's all going to be, well, you mentioned this and
[00:54:28.659 --> 00:54:32.398]   this other thing happened. Why are you a mass murderer, Trump? They're just going to try to
[00:54:32.398 --> 00:54:35.438]   put him on the back foot, keep him on the defensive, you know.
[00:54:35.999 --> 00:54:37.579]  Like the Sean Hannity interview.
[00:54:37.639 --> 00:54:40.360]  Are you going to get retribution?
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:42.001]  Are you going to be vindictive?
[00:54:42.361 --> 00:54:43.201]  Is that what's going to happen?
[00:54:43.221 --> 00:54:51.343]  They're going to put him on the back foot and attempt to make him sort of back down from, you know, any claim of like, yes, I'm going to go after justice.
[00:54:51.383 --> 00:54:53.804]  Yes, I'm going to, you know, take down the deep state.
[00:54:54.384 --> 00:54:59.745]  They're going to try to frame that type of rhetoric as dangerous and scary to get Trump to back down from it.
[00:55:00.365 --> 00:55:01.165]  But I don't think he should.
[00:55:01.465 --> 00:55:09.920]   But, you know, in terms of Trump's strategy, This is his game to lose at this point and I think if he is just like Joe.
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:15.240]   So there are two articles today, multiple articles, but two in particular by Robert
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:21.000]   Reich that were both titled something like, "I am scared to death of the debate tonight."
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.960]   So I mean, the liberals, they're literally shaking in fear right now.
[00:55:24.332 --> 00:55:31.094]  And his whole thing was he was relating it to, of course, the classic story of American debates with Richard Nixon and JFK.
[00:55:31.134 --> 00:55:32.915]  People who listened on the radio thought Nixon won.
[00:55:32.935 --> 00:55:34.696]  People who watched on TV thought JFK won.
[00:55:34.976 --> 00:55:46.541]  But he was pointing out that it's like the ultimate, most important part of the debate is the appearance of strength, the appearance of vitality, the appearance of jubilance and, you know, being a guy that you'd want to go get a beer with.
[00:55:46.601 --> 00:55:50.762]  As cliche as that is, it's cliche because it's repeated over and over because it's true.
[00:55:50.822 --> 00:55:57.302]   So I think if Trump sort of doesn't fall for their prodding, doesn't fall for their provocations
[00:55:57.302 --> 00:56:00.421]   and just kind of shrugs off their, "Oh yeah, I'm a convicted felon.
[00:56:00.421 --> 00:56:01.442]  Yeah, people fall for that."
[00:56:01.442 --> 00:56:03.382]  And then just sticks to policy.
[00:56:03.382 --> 00:56:09.262]   I think he can knock it out of the park by just playing it straight and not falling
[00:56:09.262 --> 00:56:17.021]   and not being provoked by what we know they're gonna do, which is prod him and claim he's convicted felon
[00:56:17.021 --> 00:56:21.981]   over and over and say that he's dangerous and say his followers are terrorists
[00:56:21.981 --> 00:56:26.302]   in an attempt to get him to say something that they can clip out.
[00:56:26.302 --> 00:56:28.102]  I don't think it's gonna work though.
[00:56:27.996 --> 00:56:32.178]  I think if I was Donald Trump right now, I would be going into this very confidently.
[00:56:32.258 --> 00:56:39.741]  I mean, I'd be going in like Mike Tyson in his prime, entering the ring, just getting ready to do business and get the paycheck and get out of there.
[00:56:39.761 --> 00:56:43.722]  I just hope that he's confident and not at the expense of preparing and taking it very seriously.
[00:56:43.743 --> 00:56:46.984]  I mean, there is an incredible amount at stake.
[00:56:47.665 --> 00:56:55.694]  For this country right now, and I just hope that this time he took things very seriously in preparing because even though Joe Biden is bumbling fool, you guys are right.
[00:56:55.814 --> 00:56:56.675]  It's three to one.
[00:56:56.695 --> 00:57:00.520]  The whole medium itself we know is going to be rigged or biased against him.
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:02.062]  So I just hope he's taking that very seriously.
[00:57:02.082 --> 00:57:03.023]  I think he is this time.
[00:57:03.043 --> 00:57:03.964]  I think he realizes.
[00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:08.301]  The extent to the corruption and the evilness and the depths of the swamp.
[00:57:08.341 --> 00:57:18.064]  But Owen, I do want to hear your thoughts as well on the Biden campaign strategy, not to focus on their accomplishments, but instead to focus on attacking Trump as a debate strategy.
[00:57:18.084 --> 00:57:19.104]  Do you think they're making the right call?
[00:57:20.365 --> 00:57:28.367]  Well, let's keep in mind, this is the largest audience that either one of the candidates is going to have this calendar year up to this point.
[00:57:29.048 --> 00:57:34.276]  So considering that, they have to choose very carefully what it is that they want to talk about.
[00:57:34.376 --> 00:57:43.068]  Now, if Joe Biden goes up there and claims how great the economy is, well, that's going to piss Americans off because they know that is an outright lie.
[00:57:44.015 --> 00:57:52.297]  So for him to go out there and make the typical lies and propaganda plays that they make out of the White House, it doesn't play with the audience tonight.
[00:57:52.797 --> 00:57:59.959]  Undecided voters are going to say, wait a second, I'm actually in a very tough financial situation since you got into office.
[00:57:59.999 --> 00:58:01.960]  So I don't think that one really plays well.
[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:06.541]  I mean, I don't know what else he says about the economy other than positive things.
[00:58:07.281 --> 00:58:17.805]   But I think that that's why they're saying don't lean in to Accomplishments because you don't want to gaslight all the American people so they might have some little facts here or there like he'll talk about
[00:58:18.712 --> 00:58:49.821]   Unemployment rate or something he's done for black Americans or the student debt relief and so I'll have these kind of little Anecdotal things, but I don't think he wants to make any aggressive Claims like oh, we've we've done a great thing at the southern border people know that's a lie Oh, it's the greatest economy ever people know that's a lie So I think he'll just choose some anecdotal things to try to make those points instead of just lean into as as you said accomplishments now if I'm Donald Trump and I approach this in a completely different manner.
[00:58:50.642 --> 00:58:58.986]  I understand that this thing is obviously going to be rigged against me and I have a very limited window of time to put any statements out.
[00:58:59.806 --> 00:59:06.049]  And I would almost approach it where I'm almost ignoring what the moderators are saying to an extent.
[00:59:07.077 --> 00:59:19.583]  And I would find key words or key things I can say that the American people aren't aware of, maybe even have some websites set up to plug, but a great example might be Jocelyn Nungary.
[00:59:20.003 --> 00:59:24.085]  And just say the name Jocelyn Nungary and make people look that up.
[00:59:24.585 --> 00:59:27.647]  Say the name Lake and Riley, make people look that up.
[00:59:28.608 --> 00:59:37.275]  I would try to use this time to get these pieces of information to the American people that they otherwise would never see and never hear.
[00:59:37.835 --> 00:59:39.196]  So that would be my approach.
[00:59:39.917 --> 00:59:52.748]  You know, whether it's inflation, whether it's consumer price index, whether it's different situations from the southern border or names of young women in America that have been raped and murdered by Biden border crossers.
[00:59:53.368 --> 00:59:57.249]  And I would also use good phrasing just like I just did.
[00:59:57.389 --> 01:00:03.452]  I would say Biden border crossers, Biden border invasion, Bidenflation.
[01:00:03.792 --> 01:00:07.973]  You know, this is the only time you're going to reach millions of people that otherwise don't follow politics.
[01:00:08.293 --> 01:00:29.537]   So I would be very, very choosy, very wise with the things I say so that there's tiny little clippables, little names people might want to look up, little Instances people might want to look up and and that's what I would kind of ride into this debate with you know, maybe not even think about the bombastic approach because you know, the whole thing is rigged against you.
[01:00:29.577 --> 01:00:30.518]  So just think okay.
[01:00:30.959 --> 01:00:32.220]  I've got X amount of time.
[01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:36.424]  What can I do with that time to be most effective?
[01:00:36.784 --> 01:00:41.068]  To get information to the American people that they otherwise would not get.
[01:00:41.368 --> 01:00:45.372]  Talk about Biden fumbling and bumbling and slurring and falling down steps.
[01:00:45.692 --> 01:00:49.195]  I'd have a website set up like BidenCan'tTalk.com.
[01:00:49.435 --> 01:00:55.920]   Be like, folks, if you don't believe me, just Go to the website, we set it up, BidenCan'tTalk.com, okay?
[01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:58.562]  20 straight minutes, this guy can't talk, okay?
[01:00:58.763 --> 01:01:00.484]  They got him all juiced up, we all know it.
[01:01:00.844 --> 01:01:13.194]  So that's the play I would do, is just be very strategic with the time I have and find different ways to get the American people invested in stories and information they otherwise would not know about.
[01:01:13.595 --> 01:01:14.035]  Absolutely.
[01:01:14.155 --> 01:01:21.118]   So I want to remind everybody that Alex Jones is coming on in 13 minutes at exactly 6.57 p.m.
[01:01:21.258 --> 01:01:21.759]  Central Time.
[01:01:21.779 --> 01:01:24.379]  We're going to run a three-minute promo and then Alex is going to take over.
[01:01:24.419 --> 01:01:26.220]  So make sure you stay tuned for those of you who just dropped in.
[01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:36.442]  I see that we have tens of thousands of people viewing on X, thousands of people listening in the space, and of course we are broadcasting on all the other platforms as well with tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands by now already tuning in.
[01:01:36.462 --> 01:01:39.123]  I'm sure it'll be in the millions before the end of the night.
[01:01:39.143 --> 01:01:48.025]   But one of the things I wanted to ask you about in the last 10 minutes that we have together, just the three of us guys, is Obviously we had major news and this this briefly came up which is what made me think of it.
[01:01:48.545 --> 01:01:54.386]  Major news regarding Julian Assange this week and you know Harrison and I were talking about it just sort of passively.
[01:01:54.727 --> 01:02:01.088]  It seemed to me that this plea deal happening a couple of days before this debate is incredibly convenient.
[01:02:01.568 --> 01:02:14.896]   I know that one of the major criticisms of the Trump Presidency among libertarians especially and others who are really focused on this stuff is the fact that he would pardon people like Rod Blagojevich the corrupt governor of Illinois.
[01:02:14.916 --> 01:03:03.486]   I grew up in Illinois everybody despised and loathed him but Julian Assange and Edward Snowden and others who seem now in hindsight to be really heroic journalists and I know there are claims that they endangered the lives of Americans and agents and operatives but I've never seen specific examples of that and at this point there's no reason to believe any of the claims the CIA because they claimed that the Russia collusion stuff was legitimate and the laptop was Russian disinformation so we know the CIA lies to us they have for for decades and the risk or the allegations that Julian Assange and Edward Snowden might have caused the deaths of innocent Americans or undercover operatives those accusations allegations seem very doubtful especially in Snowden's case he was very very careful but what are your thoughts about whether or not the topic of Julian Assange or Edward Snowden specifically Julian Assange
[01:03:04.057 --> 01:03:11.557]   is gonna come up tonight from Biden specifically saying, why didn't you pardon Julian Assange?
[01:03:11.557 --> 01:03:13.657]  We worked out a plea deal with him and got him out.
[01:03:13.657 --> 01:03:15.018]  Why didn't you do it when you had the chance?
[01:03:15.018 --> 01:03:18.916]   This is even gonna come up or both candidates gonna just try to dodge this sort of case.
[01:03:18.916 --> 01:03:22.797]   I seriously doubt it's gonna come up to be honest with you.
[01:03:22.797 --> 01:03:29.657]   The official establishment line at this point is still that Julian Assange put people in danger
[01:03:29.657 --> 01:03:31.097]  and was this horrible criminal.
[01:03:31.097 --> 01:03:36.757]   I mean, a Pentagon spokesperson was asked about this yesterday or maybe today, we have the video today
[01:03:36.757 --> 01:03:40.518]   where he's asked about Julian Assange and he makes the claim that, well,
[01:03:40.518 --> 01:03:43.757]  his reporting got people killed, it got people injured.
[01:03:43.757 --> 01:03:45.057]  And the reporter goes, no, it didn't.
[01:03:45.057 --> 01:03:46.916]  Can you cite any cases?
[01:03:46.916 --> 01:03:49.717]   And the guy can't cite any cases, but they're still towing that line.
[01:03:49.717 --> 01:03:51.617]  They're still running with that story.
[01:03:52.482 --> 01:03:59.824]  And as far as I know, I haven't seen any, maybe you guys have, but I haven't seen Joe Biden say anything about Julian Assange so far.
[01:03:59.844 --> 01:04:02.505]  I haven't seen him take credit for this and celebrate it.
[01:04:02.805 --> 01:04:06.826]  I don't think Joe Biden's followers or his voters like Julian Assange.
[01:04:06.846 --> 01:04:13.328]  They're convinced that Julian Assange ruined their chances in 2016 by releasing Hillary Clinton's emails and doing all this other stuff.
[01:04:13.368 --> 01:04:20.210]   So it wouldn't be an appeal to his base to talk about freeing Julian They hate Julian Assange, as far as I know.
[01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:23.991]  And it's not like he's going to, you know, talk about it, try to get the libertarian vote.
[01:04:24.011 --> 01:04:25.551]  I mean, that's nonsense.
[01:04:25.571 --> 01:04:29.792]  So I seriously doubt that Julian Assange's name gets brought up today.
[01:04:30.312 --> 01:04:33.613]  Although it could, I just don't see that happening.
[01:04:33.753 --> 01:04:38.055]  And I don't think Biden is taking credit for it because I don't think Biden had very much to do with it.
[01:04:38.695 --> 01:04:42.036]  It was a plea deal that took years to hammer out.
[01:04:42.416 --> 01:04:46.217]  And it's a legal proceeding that's been going on for nearly a decade at this point.
[01:04:47.139 --> 01:04:52.086]  And like I said, I haven't seen Joe Biden come out and say, I released Julian Assange because I believe in free speech.
[01:04:52.246 --> 01:04:55.631]  They've just sort of let the process happen behind the scenes without commenting on it.
[01:04:55.671 --> 01:04:57.173]  So I doubt it comes up.
[01:04:57.914 --> 01:04:58.334]  Interesting.
[01:04:58.635 --> 01:05:02.981]  What are your thoughts on whether Assange or Snowden or this topic at all will come up?
[01:05:03.001 --> 01:05:03.702]  Do you agree with Harrison?
[01:05:04.522 --> 01:05:05.243]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:05:05.283 --> 01:05:06.684]  It's very unlikely it will come up.
[01:05:06.744 --> 01:05:10.188]  It's very unlikely Joe Biden even knows about it, to be honest, at this point.
[01:05:10.988 --> 01:05:14.352]  And I think that Harrison's analysis is probably spot on.
[01:05:14.472 --> 01:05:19.917]  It's probably too risky, I think, for the Democrats to lean into Julian Assange.
[01:05:21.114 --> 01:05:25.918]  Especially when they're still bitter over the 2016 email leaks.
[01:05:26.598 --> 01:05:29.921]  So I think that that's probably unlikely to come up.
[01:05:30.141 --> 01:05:43.411]  And really, right now, we're still mostly dealing in the unknown about the situation that led to Assange's release, other than there was a plea deal, he's guilty of an Espionage Act violation, a lot of unheard of stuff.
[01:05:44.612 --> 01:05:46.093]  But it's kind of just speculation.
[01:05:47.347 --> 01:05:54.155]  He finally took the deal because he's really unhealthy, maybe having heart problems, dealing with a COVID vaccine side effect.
[01:05:54.696 --> 01:05:59.141]  I highly doubt he would give up any sources to get free, so I don't think that's the situation.
[01:05:59.741 --> 01:06:04.387]  But it's really kind of an unknown factor as to what eventually led to this.
[01:06:04.847 --> 01:06:18.650]  But the fact that Joe Biden has not said anything, and nobody's really claiming any victories here, tells me that there was something else that went down, and nobody really looks at this for any political points.
[01:06:18.730 --> 01:06:28.051]  Now, Trump could come out and say he would pardon him, because as of right now, he pled guilty, so there could still be a pardon factor there, but I doubt it comes up.
[01:06:28.831 --> 01:06:38.455]   Now, the reason why this is strange is Trump got bad intel from Pompeo and from Pence on Julian Assange.
[01:06:39.335 --> 01:06:49.260]  My guess is Trump's instincts were probably to pardon Assange, and maybe he was a little hesitant because it'll look like a pay-for-play type of favor.
[01:06:50.201 --> 01:07:01.226]  Not that there was any money exchange, but, you know, Assange scratched his back in the election, and so, you know, him kind of like paying it forward like, oh, you got me elected, you know, I'll pardon you.
[01:07:01.266 --> 01:07:09.114]   So maybe that's why He was hesitant to do it, but there's no doubt that Pompeo and Pence were in his ear saying, don't do it, don't do it.
[01:07:09.715 --> 01:07:11.696]  This guy is a traitor.
[01:07:12.536 --> 01:07:15.498]  But Chase, you know better.
[01:07:15.538 --> 01:07:18.840]  The deep state doesn't care about the death of Americans, innocent people.
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:19.881]  They couldn't care less.
[01:07:20.241 --> 01:07:27.806]  So for anybody to make this claim, Assange, he led to the innocent deaths of Americans or Snowden.
[01:07:28.126 --> 01:07:30.647]  These people leave people behind in Afghanistan.
[01:07:33.288 --> 01:07:35.269]  Hostages behind all the time.
[01:07:35.289 --> 01:07:37.870]  I mean, so they don't give a damn about the death of the innocent.
[01:07:39.130 --> 01:07:41.071]  Aside from all that, I don't think it comes up.
[01:07:41.491 --> 01:07:43.292]  They care about the deaths of themselves, though.
[01:07:43.332 --> 01:07:48.994]  And I think that because I think you're exactly right that Trump probably early on was like, what about this Julian Assange guy?
[01:07:49.014 --> 01:07:49.794]  Can we pardon him?
[01:07:49.834 --> 01:07:51.634]  Lots of people telling me that he's a good man.
[01:07:52.155 --> 01:07:58.397]  And he was probably told, yes, you know, both of these things that actually he was really dangerous and he killed people and it would be really bad.
[01:07:58.677 --> 01:08:04.398]   But also, you know, Trump knew from before he was inaugurated, he knew the intelligence agencies were at war with him.
[01:08:08.302 --> 01:08:12.545]  But I'll let you keep going after Assange, you know, because we're on the same team now, right?
[01:08:12.585 --> 01:08:20.150]  I mean, the whole, like, first year of Trump's presidency was trying to, like, stop the intelligence agencies from going after him.
[01:08:20.170 --> 01:08:26.414]  Remember, the first thing he did after he got inaugurated was go to the CIA headquarters and give a speech saying, hey, we're all on the same team now.
[01:08:26.474 --> 01:08:27.054]  I'm your boss.
[01:08:27.074 --> 01:08:27.995]  You got to do what I say.
[01:08:28.615 --> 01:08:30.517]  So I wouldn't be surprised if this was a...
[01:08:31.497 --> 01:08:38.021]  You know, a deal he made to say, hey, look, I'll let you keep going after Assange, you know, but we're friends, right?
[01:08:38.041 --> 01:08:39.702]  Because I'm on your side on this.
[01:08:40.402 --> 01:08:41.623]  I just wanted to back up what Owen said.
[01:08:41.703 --> 01:08:43.864]  I think you're exactly right in that in that breakdown.
[01:08:44.344 --> 01:08:44.864]  Absolutely.
[01:08:44.984 --> 01:08:48.086]  Well, obviously, a major historic moment coming up tonight.
[01:08:48.166 --> 01:08:51.168]  In five minutes, Alex Jones is going to be in studio.
[01:08:51.508 --> 01:08:58.850]   And I'm told he came in and mentioned to me, remind everyone in the X spaces at real Alex Jones on X is hosting a space to
[01:08:58.850 --> 01:09:03.248]   request to speak because I do believe he wants to go to spaces commenters
[01:09:03.248 --> 01:09:07.300]   now there are a lot of people hosting spaces tonight there's a lot of people
[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:12.119]   listening in on these spaces as this historic debate begins to unfold so we're
[01:09:12.119 --> 01:09:15.760]   anticipating it's possible that X is gonna have some glitches or technical
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:18.323]   issues on their We are prepared on our end.
[01:09:18.643 --> 01:09:24.345]  So if you have any issues hearing any of the speakers, the broadcast, or requesting to speak, just leave the space and join again.
[01:09:24.726 --> 01:09:28.167]  Also, make sure that you share the space on X as well.
[01:09:28.427 --> 01:09:41.175]   It's incredibly important that you share, retweet, repost it, comment under it with questions or thoughts, and request to speak, because the more people we have speak, the more people see that we are broadcasting this, and the more people who repost it, of course, The more people will join in and listen.
[01:09:41.195 --> 01:09:43.237]  We've already got thousands of people listening to this space now.
[01:09:43.497 --> 01:09:46.861]  I anticipate it'll be tens of thousands by the time we're done broadcasting tonight.
[01:09:47.702 --> 01:09:56.492]  And in exactly one minute, at 6.57 p.m., we're gonna run a short three-minute promo, then Alex Jones is gonna be in the chair.
[01:09:57.293 --> 01:10:03.298]  Harrison Smith, Owen Schroyer, and myself will be joining him from our several studios here as well for commentary.
[01:10:03.638 --> 01:10:07.921]  Roger Stone is going to be joining us tonight as well, and I believe Robert Barnes is going to be joining us.
[01:10:08.241 --> 01:10:14.406]  I'm not sure exactly which time yet, but we are going to have some major, major thought leaders in the space with us.
[01:10:14.466 --> 01:10:21.291]  So make sure that you share this space, share the broadcast everywhere you can, share InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:10:21.651 --> 01:10:26.595]   Stay tuned for the next Few minutes as well because Alex Jones is in studio in three minutes.
[01:10:26.775 --> 01:10:29.117]  Let's go ahead and run the promo and get started folks.
[01:10:30.639 --> 01:10:33.061]  I think Mr. Nixon is an effective leader of his party.
[01:10:33.621 --> 01:10:35.162]  I hope he would grant me the same.
[01:10:35.483 --> 01:10:40.347]  The question before us is which point of view and which party do we want to leave the United States?
[01:10:41.968 --> 01:10:44.610]  Mr. Nixon, would you like to comment on that statement?
[01:10:46.052 --> 01:10:46.652]  Who am I?
[01:10:47.793 --> 01:10:48.534]  Why am I here?
[01:10:49.861 --> 01:10:53.784]  There is no question that this nation cannot stand still.
[01:10:54.685 --> 01:10:56.727]  Because we are in a deadly competition.
[01:10:57.527 --> 01:11:00.970]  A competition not only with the men in the Kremlin, but the men in Peking.
[01:11:00.810 --> 01:11:05.810]  [Music]
[01:11:05.810 --> 01:11:11.810]  The answer to 1984 is 1776!
[01:11:11.810 --> 01:11:14.810]  1776!
[01:11:14.810 --> 01:11:25.810]  [Music]
[01:11:25.810 --> 01:11:30.810]  Because if this republic falls, the entire world falls.
[01:11:31.068 --> 01:11:33.850]  You're ahead in this competition, Senator Kennedy, I think it's implied.
[01:11:34.631 --> 01:11:39.274]  But when you're in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead.
[01:11:39.314 --> 01:11:41.695]  First of all, Rand Paul shouldn't even be on this stage.
[01:11:41.776 --> 01:11:45.998]  Governor Reagan again, typically, is against such a proposal.
[01:11:46.018 --> 01:11:49.301]  Governor, will you go again?
[01:11:51.203 --> 01:11:57.406]  I am not sitting in the United States Senate with, by the way, the worst voting record there is today.
[01:11:57.567 --> 01:12:00.888]  You know, I wasn't going to say this at all, but I can't help it.
[01:12:00.988 --> 01:12:01.989]  There you go again.
[01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:12.835]  Your brother and your brother's administration gave us Barack Obama because it was such a disaster those last three months that Abraham Lincoln couldn't have been elected.
[01:12:12.855 --> 01:12:16.197]  Mr. Green, you turn around and look at me.
[01:12:16.056 --> 01:12:16.556]  You are.
[01:12:16.556 --> 01:12:19.536]  I am paying for this microphone, Mr.
[01:12:19.536 --> 01:12:35.916]   It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not
[01:12:35.916 --> 01:12:38.095]  in charge of the law in our country.
[01:12:38.721 --> 01:12:39.681]  Because you'd be in jail.
[01:12:40.001 --> 01:12:40.722]  Secretary Clinton!
[01:12:41.702 --> 01:12:44.803]  I will not make hate an issue of this campaign.
[01:12:44.983 --> 01:12:50.124]  I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponents.
[01:12:54.525 --> 01:12:58.791]  From everything I see, has no respect for this.
[01:12:59.767 --> 01:13:06.812]  Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States.
[01:13:07.052 --> 01:13:14.437]  My social security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it.
[01:13:15.157 --> 01:13:19.140]  But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund.
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:24.824]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[01:13:25.284 --> 01:13:29.527]  Visit infowars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[01:13:30.987 --> 01:13:37.529]  How are we going to really almost deprogram these people who have signed up for the cult of Trump?
[01:13:37.689 --> 01:13:45.031]  This document is called FM3-39.40, Internment and Resettlement Operations.
[01:13:45.431 --> 01:13:49.993]  And it's a comprehensive manual issued by our very own Department of the Army.
[01:13:50.552 --> 01:14:00.552]   There are millions of Americans, almost all white, almost all Republican, who somehow need to be deprogrammed.
[01:14:00.552 --> 01:14:02.552]  But here's where it gets interesting.
[01:14:02.552 --> 01:14:04.552]  Buried within the dense military...
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:06.441]  I really believe that they have been brainwashed by this misinformation campaign.
[01:14:06.461 --> 01:14:10.461]  that could under certain circumstances be applied domestically.
[01:14:10.461 --> 01:14:16.851]   Yes, you heard that right. This manual provides guidance that is adaptable to various operational environments
[01:14:16.851 --> 01:14:22.041]   including potentially right here at home. Because they've been brainwashed, Joy.
[01:14:22.041 --> 01:14:23.581]   I really believe that they have been
[01:14:23.581 --> 01:14:26.701]  brainwashed by this misinformation campaign.
[01:14:26.701 --> 01:14:29.980]  So how do you de-radicalize these people?
[01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:37.740]   Once we educate them, we coach them on how to interact and empower the person to start thinking for themselves.
[01:14:37.961 --> 01:14:40.082]  I think a lot of people are going to have to be deprogrammed.
[01:14:40.102 --> 01:14:45.606]  We had a program addressing white supremacists.
[01:14:46.006 --> 01:14:54.592]  We had programs, federal programs, that went towards funding organizations like these that deradicalized people.
[01:14:55.392 --> 01:14:57.894]  And President Trump pulled the plug.
[01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:00.761]  Let's take a closer look at some of the specifics.
[01:15:01.241 --> 01:15:12.747]  Chapter after chapter, this document meticulously details how to set up and manage internment and resettlement facilities, how to process and transport detainees, and even how to handle medical and dental care for them.
[01:15:13.287 --> 01:15:21.411]  It talks about capturing, screening, and interrogating detainees, and outlines the roles and responsibilities of military police units in these operations.
[01:15:22.011 --> 01:15:26.874]  Now, imagine these procedures not just in a foreign war zone, but on American soil.
[01:15:27.334 --> 01:15:32.363]   The manual Over half our country needs to be reprogrammed.
[01:15:32.382 --> 01:15:34.061]  the door wide open.
[01:15:34.061 --> 01:15:39.502]   What ultimately breaks that power structure in the South is enforcement, right?
[01:15:39.502 --> 01:15:41.382]  There has to be consequences.
[01:15:41.382 --> 01:15:44.622]  Over half our country needs to be reprogrammed.
[01:15:44.622 --> 01:15:49.023]   Not just 75 million people that voted for Trump, but the conservatives in this country.
[01:15:49.023 --> 01:15:54.182]   Consider the chapter on civil support operations, which highlights the involvement of military police
[01:15:54.182 --> 01:15:57.622]  in civil missions, coordinating with civilian authorities.
[01:15:57.622 --> 01:16:03.342]   This could easily extend to domestic scenarios where the military might be called in to manage large scale
[01:16:03.342 --> 01:16:06.023]  disruptions or civil unrest.
[01:16:06.023 --> 01:16:08.622]   We're also looking at chapters that cover the rehabilitation
[01:16:08.622 --> 01:16:12.101]  of detainees and the resettlement of displaced civilians.
[01:16:12.989 --> 01:16:18.292]  Rehabilitation programs for detainees, resettlement operations for dislocated civilians.
[01:16:18.652 --> 01:16:22.634]  These are terms we associate with wartime operations in foreign lands.
[01:16:23.074 --> 01:16:28.017]  But here they are in a document that is perfectly applicable to situations within our own borders.
[01:16:28.698 --> 01:16:35.842]  A Bernie Sanders staffer was caught on undercover camera saying that Trump voters should be sent to re-education camps.
[01:16:35.882 --> 01:16:38.303]  What are we going to do with those people that resist the change?
[01:16:40.424 --> 01:16:41.265]  Because that's a big deal.
[01:16:42.893 --> 01:16:43.954]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[01:16:44.195 --> 01:16:46.277]  In Cuba, what do they do to reactionaries?
[01:16:47.859 --> 01:16:49.859]  They shot him on the beach.
[01:16:49.859 --> 01:16:51.859]  [laughter]
[01:16:51.859 --> 01:16:53.859]  [laughter]
[01:16:53.859 --> 01:16:55.859]  [laughter]
[01:16:55.859 --> 01:16:57.859]  [laughter]
[01:16:57.859 --> 01:16:59.859]  [laughter]
[01:16:59.859 --> 01:17:01.859]  [laughter]
[01:17:01.859 --> 01:17:03.859]  [laughter]
[01:17:03.859 --> 01:17:05.859]  [laughter]
[01:17:05.859 --> 01:17:07.859]  [laughter]
[01:17:07.859 --> 01:17:11.859]   What's even more troubling is the absence of clear boundaries.
[01:17:11.642 --> 01:17:15.186]  The document doesn't draw a firm line to exclude domestic application.
[01:17:15.527 --> 01:17:20.332]  Instead, it provides a flexible framework that can be adapted to various operational environments.
[01:17:20.792 --> 01:17:22.333]  The ambiguity is unsettling.
[01:17:22.713 --> 01:17:31.679]  It's like they've crafted a comprehensive plan for internment and resettlement and left it intentionally vague enough to be implemented anywhere, including right here in the U.S.
[01:17:31.759 --> 01:17:39.184]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, or recognize that kids belong to the whole community.
[01:17:39.204 --> 01:17:39.644]  Test, test, test, test.
[01:17:40.045 --> 01:17:45.048]  Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the household's, then we start making better investments.
[01:17:45.501 --> 01:17:46.662]  This isn't about fear-mongering.
[01:17:46.942 --> 01:17:49.363]  This is about being aware and vigilant.
[01:17:49.764 --> 01:17:54.126]  As citizens, it's our responsibility to scrutinize these documents and ask the hard questions.
[01:17:54.567 --> 01:18:00.170]  Why does our military have a manual for internment and resettlement operations that could be used domestically?
[01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:06.153]  And more importantly, under what circumstances would they deploy these procedures on American soil?
[01:18:07.054 --> 01:18:10.956]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[01:18:13.038 --> 01:18:16.815]   And we need the kind of camps That you all run!
[01:18:16.835 --> 01:18:18.117]  I mean, really!
[01:18:19.959 --> 01:18:25.164]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.

[01:18:34.615 --> 01:18:39.196]  Coming to you live from the Info Wars in Battle Studios in Central Texas.
[01:18:39.376 --> 01:18:46.537]  It's June 27th on this live Thursday night transmission, 7.05 Central Standard Time.
[01:18:46.577 --> 01:18:58.119]  And coming up in 55 minutes, we're going to be simulcasting this CNN rigged debate with all the manipulations and things they've got admittedly baked into this.
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:01.760]  Trump is walking into a trap, but President Trump knows that.
[01:19:02.808 --> 01:19:21.234]  And I just can't believe that the Crip Keeper, Joe Biden, the Chinese Communist spy, the Russian spy, the Ukrainian spy, the father of the crackhead, the guy that his daughter said molested her in the shower, that he's got the nerve to get up there on stage.
[01:19:21.814 --> 01:19:26.776]  Now they're going to have him lit up like a Christmas tree on methamphetamine and a lot more.
[01:19:28.296 --> 01:19:29.717]  This is going to be historical.
[01:19:30.799 --> 01:19:32.760]  And I want to thank you all for joining us tonight.
[01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:42.603]  CNN, three days ago, sent out letters to X and everybody else and said, you're not allowed to cover this or carry this or show clips of this.
[01:19:42.623 --> 01:19:51.547]  But under fair use of the law, political events, especially presidential ones, are totally protected as long as you're giving commentary and analysis.
[01:19:51.627 --> 01:19:55.148]  And that's the same thing that Elon Musk said.
[01:19:55.168 --> 01:19:56.509]  He said, you can pound sand.
[01:19:56.529 --> 01:19:57.369]  We're going to air it.
[01:19:58.012 --> 01:19:58.793]  It's going to be on X?
[01:19:58.833 --> 01:20:05.018]  Well, we're going to be here simulcasting it tonight and then we'll have commentary after it as well.
[01:20:05.739 --> 01:20:12.705]  We'll also be simulcasting on X Spaces and taking comments from speakers before and after.
[01:20:12.725 --> 01:20:30.836]   We'll also have commentary and analysis from constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes, former top Trump advisor and current confidant Roger Stone, we're going to have the great Owen Schroyer and the amazing Harrison Smith also chiming in from the studio right next door to us all tonight.
[01:20:30.876 --> 01:20:38.678]  I'm going to try to limit the comments and things during this debate, but I'm going to give some analysis so it's covered by fair use.
[01:20:39.238 --> 01:20:43.520]  If you want a clean feed of it, tune in to CNN, you'll get that there.
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:45.020]  But we're going to be giving commentary.
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:46.981]  I'll be pointing out obvious scams.
[01:20:47.421 --> 01:20:50.522]  They've got mute buttons they're going to be using predominantly obviously on Trump.
[01:20:51.081 --> 01:20:55.342]  They're going to try to cut him off and have him talking with the sound turned off to make him look like a fool.
[01:20:56.302 --> 01:20:57.663]  That'll be a big takeaway they're going to push.
[01:20:59.003 --> 01:21:02.664]  Also, Trump has a gag order on him still from the New York conviction.
[01:21:03.204 --> 01:21:09.866]  So watch Biden bring up the trial and then hoping that Trump violates the gag order so they can throw him in jail that way.
[01:21:11.367 --> 01:21:20.249]  Robert Barnes, who is accurate about 95% of the time, predicts that there is a very good chance that tonight Trump will announce his VP to steal the show.
[01:21:21.010 --> 01:21:42.067]  But as long as they can't piss Trump off, as long as they can't get him off balance, as long as he just fires the truth at Biden and how he's raped this country, and how he told the illegals when he quotes, when the election immediately surged the border, and as long as Trump gets into all the dead people and the record crime wave from the illegal aliens, if Trump uses terms like illegal alien, he will absolutely crush Biden.
[01:21:42.107 --> 01:21:43.628]  Trump's already way ahead of Biden.
[01:21:44.328 --> 01:21:53.030]   The reason they have accepted this debate, but still put a lot of guardrails for themselves in, try to rig it, kind of like loading, you know, brass knuckles in your
[01:21:53.030 --> 01:22:00.780]   boxing glove, is because Biden is so behind, they're hoping he can grab victory from the jaws of defeat
[01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:05.690]   tonight. I do intend to go to some spaces now. Obviously, we're not going to go to any during the
[01:22:05.690 --> 01:22:09.509]   debate other than a few breaks they're going to take. And we'll go right to spaces, comments
[01:22:09.509 --> 01:22:10.239]  during that.
[01:22:10.442 --> 01:22:12.163]  Roger Stone's coming up in a few minutes, popping in.
[01:22:12.403 --> 01:22:13.744]  He'll be on afterwards with us as well.
[01:22:14.044 --> 01:22:14.725]  So is Robert Barnes.
[01:22:14.765 --> 01:22:16.166]  But Chase, you've been in here doing a great job.
[01:22:16.186 --> 01:22:18.127]  I was watching the last hour of live coverage.
[01:22:18.147 --> 01:22:21.149]  The team's done an amazing job throughout the day with the War Room and the other shows.
[01:22:21.169 --> 01:22:22.630]  Appreciate everybody working so hard.
[01:22:22.670 --> 01:22:23.851]  All the crew's been here since 6 a.m.

[01:23:57.546 --> 01:24:01.488]  All right, while we're getting Roger on the line, give me your take on how epic this is.
[01:24:01.548 --> 01:24:03.709]  I mean, most of these other debates are lightweight stuff.
[01:24:04.249 --> 01:24:06.590]  There's not even been a Republican that could even challenge Trump in a debate.
[01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:09.811]  Biden shut down any other Democrat debate.
[01:24:10.730 --> 01:24:12.730]   and it just like he stole the election three and a half years ago.
[01:24:12.730 --> 01:24:16.010]   He's basically shut this down and locked out all his competition.
[01:24:16.010 --> 01:24:19.089]   So this is the first time he's got to get out of the basement or get off the beach
[01:24:19.089 --> 01:24:20.290]  and actually face somebody.
[01:24:20.290 --> 01:24:22.610]  This is a pissed off, born again, hard Donald Trump.
[01:24:22.610 --> 01:24:23.370]  What do you expect tonight?
[01:24:23.370 --> 01:24:26.730]   Well, there are so many things about this that are unprecedented, Alex, that it's
[01:24:26.730 --> 01:24:28.130]  hard to even know where to begin.
[01:24:28.130 --> 01:24:33.569]   First thing that comes to mind is we've got a CNN privately hosting this debate.
[01:24:33.609 --> 01:24:38.833]  We know CNN in the last cycle cheated, actually two cycles ago with Hillary, cheated and gave her questions.
[01:24:38.853 --> 01:24:42.957]  I don't think there's been any major internal changes at CNN to make them suddenly not corrupt.
[01:24:42.977 --> 01:24:43.997]  That's the first aspect of this.
[01:24:44.017 --> 01:24:48.421]  The second thing is it's the earliest debate, I believe, in the history of presidential debates.
[01:24:48.461 --> 01:24:50.482]  I mean, none of the conventions have happened yet.
[01:24:50.763 --> 01:24:54.786]  We've got this bizarre, really late DNC convention coming up in the fall.
[01:24:55.166 --> 01:24:57.068]  What you're saying is gonna be basically virtual as well.
[01:24:57.108 --> 01:25:01.452]  It's gonna be virtual, and so I honestly think that this is Joe Biden auditioning for his own job, Alex.
[01:25:01.692 --> 01:25:02.513]  I think you nailed it.
[01:25:02.553 --> 01:25:03.534]  The Democrats said...
[01:25:04.346 --> 01:25:06.647]  If he doesn't do well here, he will be replaced at the convention.
[01:25:07.087 --> 01:25:07.608]  Absolutely.
[01:25:07.628 --> 01:25:12.850]  And I mean, I think a lot of their strategies, too, as far as this debate being rigged, are going to backfire.
[01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:15.691]  Harrison, Owen, and myself were talking about this during the first hour.
[01:25:16.092 --> 01:25:22.235]  Things like muting Donald Trump and allowing Joe Biden to speak is not like a major gotcha against Donald Trump.
[01:25:22.275 --> 01:25:29.017]   The more Joe Biden speaks, the more likely he is to have Terrible gaffes and say something or do something incredibly embarrassing.
[01:25:29.037 --> 01:25:30.538]  So I really think this is a win-win.
[01:25:30.578 --> 01:25:34.159]  I know it's three to one in terms of adding up the moderators and Joe Biden versus Donald Trump.
[01:25:34.179 --> 01:25:35.539]  He knows he's walking into a trap.
[01:25:35.859 --> 01:25:37.340]  It's it's he's not stupid.
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:39.740]  He's got some tricks up his sleeve that are going to revert this.
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:41.021]  It's going to blow back in their face, Alex.
[01:25:41.481 --> 01:25:43.361]  Well, this is also a dead cat bounce.
[01:25:43.421 --> 01:25:47.323]  I mean, CNN has one hundred thousand viewers on their average show, their top show a million.
[01:25:48.303 --> 01:25:52.024]  I mean, when Elon Musk puts out a video, it gets 200 million views on average.
[01:25:52.664 --> 01:25:53.825]  Joe Rogan, 50 million.
[01:25:53.845 --> 01:25:54.905]  Tucker Carlson, 50 million.
[01:25:59.266 --> 01:26:00.007]  I'm not in competition.
[01:26:00.027 --> 01:26:02.828]  I love the fact that there's people more prominent than me now talking about this.
[01:26:02.868 --> 01:26:05.950]  We were just, you know, the lone mavericks here first up doing it.
[01:26:05.970 --> 01:26:07.271]  That's what we got targeted by the deep state.
[01:26:07.791 --> 01:26:13.755]  It's very refreshing to now see our worldview, which is the real worldview, being the dominant force right now.
[01:26:14.055 --> 01:26:15.376]  So the whole world's Alex Jones now.
[01:26:15.416 --> 01:26:16.497]  It's not just Alex Jones is right.
[01:26:16.877 --> 01:26:18.098]  Everybody sounds like Alex Jones.
[01:26:18.178 --> 01:26:23.201]  And the more they try to demonize people, the more it backfires.
[01:26:23.221 --> 01:26:26.043]  I want to play a short one minute clip from CNN this morning.
[01:26:26.710 --> 01:26:33.836]  Where they're teaching you what a mute button is, like you're an idiot, but since when do they mute people's mics in a debate?
[01:26:33.916 --> 01:26:35.338]  Part of it is them going back and forth.
[01:26:35.678 --> 01:26:39.041]  And again, they're going to be able to try to give Biden more time, try to give him more questions.
[01:26:39.901 --> 01:26:43.565]  But I agree, that's going to backfire on him because the more he talks, the more he bumbles around.
[01:26:43.605 --> 01:26:49.149]  The big thing is they're trying to get Trump to be muted, to cut to him when you can't hear him to say, oh look, Trump looks like a fool.
[01:26:49.390 --> 01:26:50.110]  That's not going to work.
[01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:52.212]  People get he's targeted, it's going to backfire.
[01:26:52.232 --> 01:26:54.694]   They've got big TV trucks with, you know, Sure.
[01:26:54.714 --> 01:26:56.496]  Well, let's start out with Kristen Megan.
[01:26:56.315 --> 01:27:01.154]   around saying felon, criminal, you know, people get he's Robin Hood.
[01:27:01.154 --> 01:27:03.074]  Okay, they get he's Jesse James.
[01:27:03.074 --> 01:27:08.015]  He's got that folk hero mystique 2.0, it's not working.
[01:27:08.015 --> 01:27:09.654]  Now we got Roger Stone coming on in a few minutes.
[01:27:09.654 --> 01:27:12.994]   Let me know when he's on the line guys, but let's go ahead and go to some speakers on X.
[01:27:12.994 --> 01:27:14.875]  Sure, well, let's start out with Kristen Megan.
[01:27:14.875 --> 01:27:19.514]   Kristen Megan, if you're still there, go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you have to say.
[01:27:19.514 --> 01:27:21.916]  Yeah, I'm so glad that you're doing this space.
[01:27:22.402 --> 01:27:28.466]  And I was just listening to the commentary and what I'm thinking about about this debate is first off, multiple things.
[01:27:28.486 --> 01:27:37.092]  One, all the lies that are shared through the ads and any gaffes or speeches that Biden gives, he's not ever instantly fact checked.
[01:27:37.292 --> 01:27:44.497]  So although they're doing the muting of the microphone, hopefully Trump is able to on the spot be basically a community notes fact checker.
[01:27:45.197 --> 01:27:50.441]  But also we all know a history that Biden gets very irate and angry when things don't go his way.
[01:27:51.202 --> 01:27:52.522]  I have a father who has dementia.
[01:27:52.623 --> 01:27:54.644]  I've seen it myself, the lashes out of anger.
[01:27:55.184 --> 01:28:06.273]  And I would not be surprised to see him basically lose his shit on Trump and really show that he's not some just old frail man, but I think his true colors show, and it's not just because of the dementia.
[01:28:06.633 --> 01:28:08.034]  So this is going to be very interesting.
[01:28:08.254 --> 01:28:19.380]   And, um, as a libertarian, It's just really funny because many of us have issues with Trump, but all these attacks are just bringing us closer and closer to just wanting to support and donate toward him.
[01:28:19.861 --> 01:28:27.744]  Because when we share the same common enemy, which is, you know, these globalists and these sociopaths, you know, we have to collectively work together.
[01:28:27.804 --> 01:28:30.825]  And I feel like it's going to be on full display tonight what's really going on.
[01:28:32.446 --> 01:28:33.246]  That's a great point.
[01:28:33.446 --> 01:28:35.147]  And I haven't checked in a few days.
[01:28:35.267 --> 01:28:36.068]  What's the latest?
[01:28:36.128 --> 01:28:41.464]   Trump since his Show trial conviction less than a month ago, it raised like 600, almost 700 million.
[01:28:41.724 --> 01:28:42.806]  What's the number now, Chase?
[01:28:43.046 --> 01:28:50.774]  I don't know what the number is off the top of my head, but funny thing about that, Alex, is weren't they just bragging the Biden administration about getting like 20 million dollars from Bloomberg?
[01:28:50.814 --> 01:28:57.341]  They have to get 20 million from one guy or however many tens of millions it was, but Trump is literally raising hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:28:57.361 --> 01:28:59.623]  His average contribution, when I saw it last week, is 43 dollars.
[01:29:00.484 --> 01:29:00.745]  Yes.
[01:29:00.985 --> 01:29:02.187]  Can I just tell you guys real quick?
[01:29:02.207 --> 01:29:05.591]  I mean, it's four times any previous record for small donations.
[01:29:05.631 --> 01:29:05.872]  Yes.
[01:29:05.972 --> 01:29:08.295]  The last guy to get those donations was Donald Trump in 2016.
[01:29:08.896 --> 01:29:09.056]  Yep.
[01:29:09.156 --> 01:29:10.819]  When you put America first, it's four times.
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:12.261]  America puts you first.
[01:29:12.661 --> 01:29:13.763]  Yeah, that's an old number.
[01:29:14.504 --> 01:29:15.325]  It was 600 plus million.
[01:29:18.533 --> 01:29:19.294]  So that's not right.
[01:29:19.654 --> 01:29:22.876]  It was $600 million less than three weeks in.
[01:29:23.276 --> 01:29:23.536]  Right.
[01:29:23.757 --> 01:29:25.418]  That's $170 million at the end of May that they had.
[01:29:25.538 --> 01:29:26.538]  And they've raised a lot of money.
[01:29:26.739 --> 01:29:27.479]  I'll just look it up.
[01:29:27.499 --> 01:29:27.899]  No problem.
[01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:29.821]  So not to interject, I have the number.
[01:29:29.841 --> 01:29:31.702]  How much has Trump raised since his conviction?
[01:29:31.902 --> 01:29:33.003]  That's the number we need.
[01:29:33.303 --> 01:29:34.544]  Notice that's like Christmas now.
[01:29:34.564 --> 01:29:36.685]  At first it was like $100 million in one day.
[01:29:36.705 --> 01:29:37.506]  $200 million in four days.
[01:29:37.526 --> 01:29:38.587]  $300 million in a week and a half.
[01:29:38.607 --> 01:29:39.327]  $400 million in two weeks.
[01:29:39.347 --> 01:29:40.728]  $500 million in two and a half weeks.
[01:29:40.547 --> 01:29:44.108]   400 million in two weeks, 500 million in two and a half weeks.
[01:29:44.108 --> 01:29:46.587]  It was up to 600 million when I saw it.
[01:29:49.237 --> 01:29:52.420]  Type in Trump raises $600 million since conviction.
[01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:53.501]  I saw that last Friday.
[01:29:53.861 --> 01:30:01.368]  So it's over $600 million, four times any previous record in that amount of time.
[01:30:01.648 --> 01:30:02.830]  It's absolutely unbelievable.
[01:30:02.850 --> 01:30:04.191]  From record small donations.
[01:30:04.651 --> 01:30:04.872]  Yes.
[01:30:05.272 --> 01:30:07.334]  And you know, there's obviously more to it than just money.
[01:30:08.495 --> 01:30:11.718]  If money won elections by itself, Bloomberg would be the President of the United States.
[01:30:11.738 --> 01:30:12.778]  He spent an astronomical sum.
[01:30:12.798 --> 01:30:16.661]  But it's the symbol of raising that much in such a short period of time that's the indicator.
[01:30:16.701 --> 01:30:18.222]  It's not even the volume of money.
[01:30:18.462 --> 01:30:20.504]  It's the amount of people after these 34 convictions.
[01:30:20.524 --> 01:30:22.005]  It's the small donations.
[01:30:22.545 --> 01:30:23.205]  Yes.
[01:30:23.225 --> 01:30:23.646]  $43 at a time.
[01:30:23.666 --> 01:30:25.467]  $43 on average.
[01:30:25.827 --> 01:30:26.187]  Wow.
[01:30:26.508 --> 01:30:27.128]  That's incredible.
[01:30:27.568 --> 01:30:28.169]  And that's the number.
[01:30:28.209 --> 01:30:29.310]  And I should have thought of that.
[01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:31.691]  But it was a lot of news for the first two weeks.
[01:30:32.392 --> 01:30:33.853]  I had to dig for that last week.
[01:30:34.433 --> 01:30:35.494]  I think it was $620-something million last Friday.
[01:30:38.215 --> 01:30:40.796]  My memory serves people who watch know I'm not.
[01:30:41.236 --> 01:30:42.296]  600 million in three weeks.
[01:30:42.656 --> 01:30:43.376]  That's absolutely insane.
[01:30:43.396 --> 01:30:44.536]  I've never heard anything like that before.
[01:30:44.556 --> 01:30:45.696]  I wonder what the record was before.
[01:30:48.597 --> 01:30:52.958]  They said Trump had at least four times any previous amount of small donations in less than three weeks.
[01:30:53.858 --> 01:30:57.819]  So, guys, put Dew on it or put somebody on it because I want that number.
[01:30:58.179 --> 01:30:59.679]  That's something they don't want discussed.
[01:31:00.079 --> 01:31:01.139]  Okay, let's go to another speaker.
[01:31:01.379 --> 01:31:03.000]  Okay, let's go to Wars of the Info.
[01:31:03.020 --> 01:31:04.200]  Wars of the Info, go ahead and speak.
[01:31:04.952 --> 01:31:11.526]  Hey guys, I'm just glad to be on the air with you and be watching this debate tonight, man.
[01:31:11.546 --> 01:31:12.528]  It's gonna be wild.
[01:31:12.648 --> 01:31:12.948]  What's that?
[01:31:16.946 --> 01:31:17.606]  No, I'm here, brother.
[01:31:17.426 --> 01:31:18.426]  I'm listening to you.
[01:31:18.426 --> 01:31:21.066]  No, no, so I'm just, I just can't believe it.
[01:31:21.066 --> 01:31:26.306]   I mean, the whole setup, I mean, we can all easily see how they are.
[01:31:26.306 --> 01:31:28.466]  I mean, the arrangement is insane.
[01:31:28.466 --> 01:31:31.506]  This has never gone on in American history.
[01:31:31.506 --> 01:31:34.145]  And it's just totally, everything is rigged.
[01:31:34.145 --> 01:31:40.426]   I mean, we're living in a Hollywood planned out script of just nonsense.
[01:31:40.519 --> 01:31:41.920]  That's what it is and we all know it.
[01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:45.822]  And I've been listening to you so long and thanks for the things you do.
[01:31:46.282 --> 01:31:48.803]  Because it's taught me, you know, a lot of things, man.
[01:31:48.843 --> 01:31:51.665]  I just really respect you guys and this show a lot.
[01:31:52.525 --> 01:31:55.106]  And I don't really... that's about it, man.
[01:31:55.146 --> 01:31:55.467]  You know?
[01:31:57.087 --> 01:31:57.988]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[01:31:58.028 --> 01:31:59.368]  We appreciate you joining us.
[01:31:59.729 --> 01:32:00.349]  Next up, Chase.
[01:32:03.087 --> 01:32:06.247]   yourself and I just lost your audio that's okay let's start over. Go ahead and unmute
[01:32:06.247 --> 01:32:09.926]   yourself and say what you got to say we always love having you in the space.
[01:32:09.926 --> 01:32:15.606]   I just wanted to come in and say hi and I appreciate that all of you are hosting the
[01:32:15.606 --> 01:32:21.728]   debate for this evening as I'm certain that it will be quite comical
[01:32:21.784 --> 01:32:24.505]  I'm sorry, that was my father speaking in the background.
[01:32:24.825 --> 01:32:29.647]  And anyways, my point is, is that stolen elections have consequences.
[01:32:30.387 --> 01:32:40.112]  And we're going to see Joe Biden, who is severely compromised by the Chinese Communist Party and virtually every NGO in existence on this planet.
[01:32:40.852 --> 01:32:45.074]  And I really, truly believe that it's going to be a national embarrassment for him.
[01:32:46.241 --> 01:32:51.702]  And again, this is round three that he's up against President Trump.
[01:32:51.862 --> 01:32:54.462]  Trump annihilated him previously.
[01:32:55.483 --> 01:33:09.105]  And I think that it's obvious that CNN has rigged the debate for Joe Biden because they have a track record of passing on the debate questions and they have not fixed this situation they have at CNN.
[01:33:09.285 --> 01:33:10.425]  They will do it again.
[01:33:11.285 --> 01:33:14.726]  So with saying that, I think that it will be a great night of comedy.
[01:33:16.050 --> 01:33:20.751]  So I appreciate that you're all hosting, and I'll just stay on to listen.
[01:33:21.412 --> 01:33:22.272]  Thanks so much, guys.
[01:33:23.532 --> 01:33:24.632]  Thank you, Liz Churchill.
[01:33:24.672 --> 01:33:25.313]  Great points.
[01:33:25.373 --> 01:33:29.754]  We're gonna have Robert Barnes and Robert Stone coming up before we go to the live debate here.
[01:33:29.774 --> 01:33:31.354]  Again, we're gonna have live coverage right here.
[01:33:31.374 --> 01:33:32.935]  You will see it right here.
[01:33:32.975 --> 01:33:38.536]  You will hear the audio at Spaces on X, and you will see the video at Real Alex Jones.
[01:33:38.576 --> 01:33:39.097]  Just go there.
[01:33:39.117 --> 01:33:40.077]  It's at the top of the page.
[01:33:40.537 --> 01:33:41.497]  Live coverage of the debate.
[01:33:41.637 --> 01:33:56.670]   Watch it here, and if you want to be Effective at waking people up, send the link out from Real Alex Jones, the top of Real Alex Jones on X, to everybody you know and say, watch the debate here with commentary by the most banned man in the world, Alex Jones and his crew.
[01:33:56.911 --> 01:33:58.111]  Chase Geiser, who's up next?
[01:33:58.491 --> 01:33:59.712]  Let's go to Colonel Gannon.
[01:33:59.972 --> 01:34:01.993]  Colonel, go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you have to say.
[01:34:02.954 --> 01:34:03.274]  Hey, yep.
[01:34:03.674 --> 01:34:06.135]  Chase, Alex, thank you guys so much for covering everything.
[01:34:06.776 --> 01:34:08.377]  Great job waking everybody up.
[01:34:08.717 --> 01:34:18.971]   I just want to say if, you know, if I could give Trump one piece of advice, I would ask him to Give Joe Biden the first 30 minutes and just say, look over him and go, it depends, but you know what?
[01:34:19.191 --> 01:34:22.975]  Why don't you just tell people why you should be reelected as president?
[01:34:23.075 --> 01:34:29.442]  And I'm going to give you 30 minutes while the entire world is watching to speak and explain it to folks.
[01:34:30.002 --> 01:34:30.303]  You're right.
[01:34:30.343 --> 01:34:32.665]  He would totally, because all he's going to have is one-liners.
[01:34:32.705 --> 01:34:33.466]  He would disintegrate.
[01:34:34.830 --> 01:34:35.010]  Right.
[01:34:35.751 --> 01:34:48.222]  Just let him be exposed for the first 30 minutes and then the last hour is Trump actually being a human being who was elected last time, by the way, and it would be over.
[01:34:48.322 --> 01:34:56.350]  I don't think it's going to happen that way, but man, if Trump would just let that man speak for 30 minutes while the entire world is watching, that's the end of Joe Biden.
[01:34:58.136 --> 01:34:59.917]  And Colonel Ghanem, you're an amazing guy.
[01:34:59.937 --> 01:35:01.178]  I've been in a lot of spaces with you.
[01:35:01.638 --> 01:35:02.519]  You've also been a guest.
[01:35:02.539 --> 01:35:07.543]  You were the deputy commander of the forces there under Trump in South Korea for those huge events.
[01:35:07.903 --> 01:35:09.004]  You really know what you're talking about.
[01:35:09.404 --> 01:35:18.131]  What do you make of the documented whistleblowers and the new documents coming out that under Biden, they're accelerating the building of internment camps for Americans?
[01:35:18.151 --> 01:35:23.755]  And then we have the Democrats all over the news saying, martial law is coming, civil war, we're going to arrest all the Trump supporters.
[01:35:24.135 --> 01:35:26.477]  This is ominous totalitarian desperateness.
[01:35:27.578 --> 01:35:29.139]  From their side, but I'm very concerned.
[01:35:29.359 --> 01:35:30.800]  I'm sure you're aware of these developments.
[01:35:31.181 --> 01:35:34.964]  If you're not, you can pass on that, but I wanted to get your take on it as a military man.
[01:35:35.865 --> 01:35:41.610]  Yeah, so, you know, I've been following, you know, your updates and the other updates on this.
[01:35:42.571 --> 01:35:54.849]   What I'm most terrified about is my fellow, the people that I served with that are still in the service, those general officers now not having the courage to stand up against it right now, because I'm worried about the wokeness and the people who stuck around or the people
[01:35:54.849 --> 01:35:57.608]   who didn't fight back or people who aren't fighting back in the military
[01:35:57.608 --> 01:36:01.208]   that they would actually be willing to enforce these things so
[01:36:01.208 --> 01:36:08.568]   I don't know we're on the precipice of that I don't believe that we have you know good people at the DHS that
[01:36:08.568 --> 01:36:09.849]  that have our best interest in mind.
[01:36:09.926 --> 01:36:12.027]  They're obviously spending money building these things.
[01:36:13.227 --> 01:36:19.089]  Now, the question is, are there enough collaborators in the machine to do it?
[01:36:19.209 --> 01:36:20.590]  I don't think there are right now, Alex.
[01:36:20.610 --> 01:36:22.830]  I think we've woken enough people up, but I don't know that.
[01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:28.232]  And the most horrifying thing to me is that there's no one in the military.
[01:36:28.252 --> 01:36:31.573]  Not one general officer has come up and said, you know what, I'm putting my stars on the line.
[01:36:31.737 --> 01:36:34.615]  You poison the entire United States military with a vaccine.
[01:36:34.615 --> 01:36:38.056]   Because they won't come forward with that, I'm worried that those same type folks would
[01:36:38.056 --> 01:36:40.936]   be the kind of folks that would run us into those internment camps.
[01:36:40.936 --> 01:36:44.297]  Well, I totally agree with you.
[01:36:44.297 --> 01:36:48.697]   And it shows complete desperation that they're pre-programming this in the news,
[01:36:48.697 --> 01:36:51.256]  both in news and in fiction with all these movies.
[01:36:51.256 --> 01:36:55.497]   And it just shows the desperation that the establishment should just pull back like a
[01:36:55.497 --> 01:36:57.817]  moray eel into their hole and come back later.
[01:36:58.015 --> 01:37:00.356]  But instead, they want the confrontation.
[01:37:00.396 --> 01:37:06.740]  Now that's why we've all got to be completely peaceful and not be lured into any confrontations because we're winning hearts and minds right now.
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:11.043]  They're failing on every front and all they're hoping for is some type of violent confrontation.
[01:37:13.084 --> 01:37:13.764]  Amen, Alex.
[01:37:13.804 --> 01:37:27.174]   There's no doubt that what they would like to see, what the elites would like to see more than ever is for us to try to destroy ourselves or get into something that gave them the precursor they needed to bring on totalitarian control, but
[01:37:27.174 --> 01:37:31.194]   more than that to convince enough general officers and lower level people down to the colonel
[01:37:31.194 --> 01:37:35.433]   level to take actions that they wouldn't normally undertake, kind of like 9/11, maybe
[01:37:35.433 --> 01:37:37.694]   even like October 7th like you saw in Israel.
[01:37:37.694 --> 01:37:42.734]   But you made some good points, I'll interrupt you on the civilian camps are setting up on
[01:37:42.734 --> 01:37:43.734]  record.
[01:37:43.734 --> 01:37:47.054]   Getting back, any other points, the point you made about Trump was excellent.
[01:37:47.658 --> 01:37:57.042]  I'm really concerned about all the rigging we've seen here, and how they've got the mute on, and we know the past debates, they give hard questions to Trump, softballs to Biden, how they cut Trump off.
[01:37:57.763 --> 01:38:03.045]  I'm really concerned, and I know Trump's a lion, but he is literally marching into a den of criminals right now.
[01:38:04.806 --> 01:38:09.948]  My guess is he's going to go in there very calm, and just kind of the expectable.
[01:38:10.469 --> 01:38:22.200]   The kind of thing that makes me concerned about President Trump Uh, is that he's gonna go in there and he's used to having an audience where he basically gets energy off of the people around him and those people won't be there and all he's gonna have is a couple demons in the room.
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:27.962]  It sounds to me like the press is not even being allowed to be in there other than the two CNN moderators.
[01:38:28.082 --> 01:38:35.369]   One of them, who's I think her husband, Actually signed the thing saying Hunter Biden's laptop wasn't real, right?
[01:38:35.589 --> 01:38:35.910]  That's right.
[01:38:35.930 --> 01:38:40.874]  He was the leader of the 51 intelligence agents and chiefs that were caught lying.
[01:38:41.354 --> 01:38:43.516]  NSA heads, CIA heads.
[01:38:43.956 --> 01:38:44.917]  He's a real ringleader.
[01:38:44.957 --> 01:38:46.458]  So yeah, well, you're a smart guy.
[01:38:46.478 --> 01:38:47.179]  Let me ask you this.
[01:38:47.199 --> 01:38:48.520]  I want to get Chase's take.
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:53.644]  Why would they want no one in there but the moderators Trump and Biden?
[01:38:53.704 --> 01:38:54.405]  That is creepy.
[01:38:55.106 --> 01:38:56.287]  It is, and it's beyond creepy.
[01:38:56.407 --> 01:39:02.812]  And so a couple things that kind of ran through my head as that kind of came out today, especially with the, I'm hearing there's a one to two minute delay, right?
[01:39:03.232 --> 01:39:07.355]  So if that's the case, there's, I'm worried about Trump's physical safety in there, right?
[01:39:07.435 --> 01:39:09.957]  He's isolated in that room with people.
[01:39:10.017 --> 01:39:15.201]  I hope the Secret Service or his, his detail are within arm's reach of him at all time.
[01:39:15.241 --> 01:39:17.102]  And frankly, they probably should have their guns trained.
[01:39:17.382 --> 01:39:32.943]  on any live human being in that place.
[01:39:32.730 --> 01:39:35.800]  there's a delay. It's the law. We have a 10-second delay.
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:40.819]   Nobody runs more than a 15-second. The NFL does that for whatever weird reasons.
[01:39:40.819 --> 01:39:45.930]   Nobody runs a 30-second or one minute or two minute. I saw that. A two-minute delay?
[01:39:45.930 --> 01:39:50.519]   That is weird. That is unprecedented. Well, why? What are they scared is going to
[01:39:50.519 --> 01:39:57.330]   be said that they may want to just shut everything down, Colonel? I think one
[01:39:57.330 --> 01:40:00.550]   would be basic risk mitigation, which is Joe Biden collapses on
[01:40:00.550 --> 01:40:01.290]  stage right now.
[01:40:01.306 --> 01:40:02.827]  Because he can't stand up for 90 minutes.
[01:40:02.847 --> 01:40:06.549]  He poops his pants because he did in front of the Pope and other folks, right?
[01:40:06.589 --> 01:40:09.731]  So we know he's got all those issues going on.
[01:40:09.911 --> 01:40:16.436]  Or Biden goes completely spacey and they just need to stop the production for a minute to try to see if they can get him back online.
[01:40:16.456 --> 01:40:16.776]  Bingo!
[01:40:16.976 --> 01:40:18.497]  There's no coming back from that anyway.
[01:40:18.942 --> 01:40:23.970]  But what I am concerned about, because... Exactly, because no other cameras are allowed in.
[01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:29.238]  It gives them total control, which shows how they're gambling with this hopped up dementia patient.
[01:40:29.398 --> 01:40:30.119]  This guy's smart.
[01:40:30.460 --> 01:40:31.501]  See, I wouldn't even have thought of that.
[01:40:31.702 --> 01:40:32.322]  Keep going, Colonel.
[01:40:33.604 --> 01:40:33.745]  So...
[01:40:34.474 --> 01:40:37.477]  You know, so that's the Joe Biden portion of it, right?
[01:40:37.577 --> 01:40:38.358]  He could collapse or whatever.
[01:40:38.398 --> 01:40:42.802]  But what I truly worry about is the safety, the physical safety of President Trump.
[01:40:42.822 --> 01:40:51.111]  Because if they have two minutes and if his Secret Service, like his son needs to be standing next to him or at least right there next to him.
[01:40:51.491 --> 01:40:54.653]  Because they could hit him with something while he's up there on that stage.
[01:40:54.693 --> 01:41:13.685]  I would not put it past the demons that poisoned everyone in the entire United States military to hit him with a direct... And by the way, I saw articles on CNN and the Washington Post saying they're predicting one of them will have a medic... Guys, type in, experts believe one of the two candidates will have a medical emergency.
[01:41:13.705 --> 01:41:17.888]  That's a ridiculous... So what do you make of that?
[01:41:19.848 --> 01:41:22.449]  In normal times, Alex, I couldn't even believe it.
[01:41:22.489 --> 01:41:32.592]  But we're at a point where the leadership of the United States military, the entire United States military leadership, poisoned the entire United States military with a poison shot.
[01:41:32.632 --> 01:41:34.312]  So everything is on the table.
[01:41:35.193 --> 01:41:38.554]  I mean, we're literally at this spiritual battle.
[01:41:38.654 --> 01:41:40.534]  And the question is, do we have enough good people around him?
[01:41:40.554 --> 01:41:41.235]  And I pray.
[01:41:41.395 --> 01:41:42.255]  I mean, I really pray.
[01:41:42.295 --> 01:41:42.695]  No, you're right.
[01:41:43.226 --> 01:41:45.928]  Smart people around him that have looked at these things.
[01:41:45.968 --> 01:41:48.670]  Because I don't put... I mean, think about it.
[01:41:49.210 --> 01:41:50.691]  The woman, is it Dana Bash?
[01:41:50.731 --> 01:41:51.512]  Is it her husband?
[01:41:51.652 --> 01:41:53.833]  That was the... Yes.
[01:41:54.094 --> 01:41:55.595]  Dana Bash is there.
[01:41:55.915 --> 01:41:58.617]  Her husband said the Hunter laptop wasn't true.
[01:41:59.057 --> 01:42:01.979]  And it's got child pornography on it that Hunter is engaged in.
[01:42:02.659 --> 01:42:04.080]  Folks, everything... Well, let's be clear.
[01:42:04.100 --> 01:42:08.764]  He was a ringleader creating the plan for the 51 intelligence people.
[01:42:09.364 --> 01:42:10.525]  But you hit the nail on the head here.
[01:42:11.289 --> 01:42:15.750]  That they are completely desperate, God knows what they're going to do, and why would they have a two-minute delay?
[01:42:15.870 --> 01:42:16.210]  Wow!
[01:42:16.330 --> 01:42:21.252]  This is... Man, I'm glad you called in because I was thinking about that, but I didn't think to bring it up.
[01:42:21.352 --> 01:42:22.212]  That is crazy!
[01:42:22.572 --> 01:42:23.512]  Case, what do you think's happening?
[01:42:23.532 --> 01:42:24.813]  We've got a final comment from the Colonel.
[01:42:25.013 --> 01:42:40.577]  Well, the Biden administration has come out and said, the campaign has come out and said, or CNN has come out and said that they don't want an audience there because they don't want Donald Trump to be able to feed off of the audience, which is a bizarre thing to say because you're sort of admitting that the audience... Well, they usually pack it with donors anyway!
[01:42:40.737 --> 01:42:41.417]  Right.
[01:42:41.477 --> 01:42:44.339]  Are you admitting that the audience would be more likely to be supportive of Trump?
[01:42:44.379 --> 01:42:45.099]  Is he more popular?
[01:42:45.119 --> 01:42:45.680]  That's the first thing.
[01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:55.525]  So I think the real reason, I think we're hitting it on the head here, is that they don't want anybody in there with their phones capturing videos and they don't want any witnesses in the event that something embarrassing happens, that they have to take off of the live stream.
[01:42:55.665 --> 01:42:57.206]  They don't want people doing viral videos.
[01:42:57.286 --> 01:43:02.809]  And that's why they're saying in a press release, don't even play clips, don't even have commentary.
[01:43:03.010 --> 01:43:03.230]  Right.
[01:43:03.610 --> 01:43:05.351]  Which we're going to violate that right now.
[01:43:06.251 --> 01:43:12.853]  Yeah, well, I mean, they say that it's an intellectual property argument and they want to monetize the content, but the fact of the matter is they just want to control the narrative.
[01:43:12.873 --> 01:43:17.795]  Well, must check with his lawyers, and I've said this days ago, the DMCA takedowns do not apply here.
[01:43:17.815 --> 01:43:18.935]  This is public, fair use, 100%.
[01:43:19.855 --> 01:43:21.856]  This is the classic thing of presidential debate.
[01:43:22.399 --> 01:43:22.819]  Absolutely.
[01:43:22.839 --> 01:43:32.243]  Well, even if you want to do commentary on YouTube on movies, you can show clips from Hollywood movies and talk about them, as long as you're talking about them and not just rebroadcasting the intellectual property.
[01:43:32.263 --> 01:43:33.404]  It's not pirating or illegal.
[01:43:33.644 --> 01:43:37.126]  I mean, this doesn't have to be... And fiction productions are the most protected because they really don't matter.
[01:43:37.146 --> 01:43:37.446]  Right.
[01:43:37.686 --> 01:43:38.746]  So they're the least protected.
[01:43:38.766 --> 01:43:39.207]  You can do it.
[01:43:39.267 --> 01:43:39.687]  Exactly.
[01:43:39.727 --> 01:43:42.288]  But a live presidential or political event is fair use.
[01:43:42.528 --> 01:43:45.569]  Absolutely ridiculous that they want to control... Colonel, you've made a lot of excellent points.
[01:43:45.629 --> 01:43:47.310]  I keep interrupting because you're so on target.
[01:43:47.330 --> 01:43:48.351]  Give us more of your knowledge.
[01:43:48.391 --> 01:43:49.291]  What else are you worried about?
[01:43:51.562 --> 01:43:53.583]  I'm worried about my granddaughter.
[01:43:53.663 --> 01:43:56.144]  I'm worried about, you know, my family, just like you are, Alex.
[01:43:56.184 --> 01:43:58.884]  And thank God you guys are just telling the truth every single day.
[01:43:59.024 --> 01:44:06.246]  And as it's shown to you, just keep telling it because that's what is the greatness of America.
[01:44:06.266 --> 01:44:08.287]  And if we do that, we have the courage like you guys all have.
[01:44:09.228 --> 01:44:23.194]  I think we're going to get through this, and I think it's good to talk about these things in front of him, because if there's bad ideas in places out there, I wish I was listening to you and more people were listening to you before 9-11, because if it was happening, maybe they wouldn't have done it, right?
[01:44:23.954 --> 01:44:24.654]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:44:26.155 --> 01:44:29.336]  God bless you, and Colonel, by the way, I wouldn't kiss your ass saying you brought up some great points.
[01:44:29.376 --> 01:44:30.636]  You just knocked it out of the park.
[01:44:30.716 --> 01:44:32.797]  I mean, that was powerful.
[01:44:32.917 --> 01:44:34.218]  Yeah, sharp as a whip, great guest.
[01:44:35.117 --> 01:44:35.658]  Who's up next?
[01:44:35.798 --> 01:44:37.240]  Alright, let's go next to Free the World.
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:40.023]  Free the World, go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you have to say if you're still with us.
[01:44:41.445 --> 01:44:43.328]  Yeah, I'm still here if you guys can hear me.
[01:44:43.188 --> 01:44:46.387]  I don't have the best device or equipment here.
[01:44:46.387 --> 01:44:48.387]  So...
[01:44:48.387 --> 01:44:50.387]  [no audio]
[01:44:50.387 --> 01:44:52.387]  Looks like we might have lost you.
[01:44:53.291 --> 01:44:55.893]  Hold on, I'll go back to you but I want to say something.
[01:44:56.774 --> 01:44:57.915]  Hold for a minute.
[01:44:57.955 --> 01:45:01.558]  Liz Churchill said she's sorry her dad's talking in the background and she's taken care of.
[01:45:01.918 --> 01:45:02.619]  We love that.
[01:45:02.979 --> 01:45:04.260]  This lady's got a bad connection.
[01:45:04.540 --> 01:45:05.061]  It's okay.
[01:45:05.121 --> 01:45:06.322]  We love regular people.
[01:45:06.642 --> 01:45:07.943]  We're all about regular people.
[01:45:07.963 --> 01:45:08.864]  We're about people power.
[01:45:09.384 --> 01:45:10.105]  We love this.
[01:45:10.405 --> 01:45:13.027]  This show is about the regular common folk.
[01:45:13.147 --> 01:45:13.888]  I'm common folk.
[01:45:14.388 --> 01:45:15.289]  About saying no.
[01:45:15.369 --> 01:45:17.471]  So don't ever thank us for having you on.
[01:45:17.531 --> 01:45:21.034]  Don't ever get sad that you stumbled.
[01:45:21.374 --> 01:45:22.916]  We want real people engaged.
[01:45:22.956 --> 01:45:23.496]  Thank you, ma'am.
[01:45:23.676 --> 01:45:24.237]  Please continue.
[01:45:26.514 --> 01:45:27.215]  Oh yeah, we're good.
[01:45:27.235 --> 01:45:27.575]  Thank you.
[01:45:28.556 --> 01:45:29.577]  Yeah, no, I'm here.
[01:45:29.597 --> 01:45:35.502]  I'm still late a little bit, but yeah, so I think President Trump, he needs to do exactly what you were saying for the general public.
[01:45:35.542 --> 01:45:36.763]  He needs to stay calm tonight.
[01:45:37.144 --> 01:45:41.928]  He needs to hit on the real points, and I know he's kind of an attack dog, which is good.
[01:45:41.968 --> 01:45:42.829]  We love that about him.
[01:45:43.329 --> 01:45:46.210]  But I think anything that he does, they're going to use against him this time.
[01:45:46.250 --> 01:45:51.752]  That's why they have the ability to mute his mic and they are really twisting everything with the medical emergency.
[01:45:52.192 --> 01:45:53.693]  You know, it's a risk for President Trump.
[01:45:53.753 --> 01:45:56.874]  It's also an excuse for President Biden to bow out if things get bad.
[01:45:56.934 --> 01:45:59.055]  They can say, you know, his health has been bad.
[01:45:59.115 --> 01:45:59.995]  We saw this coming.
[01:46:00.035 --> 01:46:04.037]  They can use that as an excuse so that he doesn't look bad in the media.
[01:46:04.777 --> 01:46:05.879]  Well, that's right.
[01:46:05.939 --> 01:46:09.603]  I saw this afternoon the new change to a two-minute delay.
[01:46:09.643 --> 01:46:10.484]  That's unprecedented.
[01:46:10.564 --> 01:46:11.585]  That creeps me out.
[01:46:11.885 --> 01:46:16.390]  Yeah, well, CNN did come out and backpedal and say that they weren't really doing that, but I think they're lying.
[01:46:16.410 --> 01:46:17.231]  I mean, they lie all the time.
[01:46:17.271 --> 01:46:21.356]  So this morning it was rumored they were going to do two minutes, then they said it's not true, it's just a conspiracy theory.
[01:46:21.656 --> 01:46:22.918]  I doubt that they're not going to do it.
[01:46:23.378 --> 01:46:24.820]  It seems like exactly in their playbook.
[01:46:25.529 --> 01:46:26.750]  Yeah, I think they are too.
[01:46:26.790 --> 01:46:29.392]  I think it's an excuse for them to try to cut things out.
[01:46:29.492 --> 01:46:34.917]  Anything where Biden looks bad, anything where Trump looks good, I think they're going to do their best to manipulate that however they can.
[01:46:35.498 --> 01:46:37.259]  And I forget who touched on it earlier.
[01:46:37.279 --> 01:46:41.803]  It might have been before Alex got here, but someone had mentioned the whole VP debacle.
[01:46:41.843 --> 01:46:43.745]  You know, is he going to mention his VP?
[01:46:44.546 --> 01:47:02.428]  And I just quickly wanted to throw that in and say I think that he should and it is partially because I think if he mentions his VP now, there's less of a chance that they're going to try to do something to him if he picks someone who is like a real bulldog, someone who they are afraid to put in that seat.
[01:47:02.808 --> 01:47:10.554]  Because we want someone as VP where they don't want to get rid of Trump because he's just as bad or just as good in our view, you know?
[01:47:10.634 --> 01:47:14.017]  So somebody like, they mentioned, the Vake, I think it would be a great choice.
[01:47:14.457 --> 01:47:18.500]  Somebody very outspoken and very tough that they just can't shut up.
[01:47:18.521 --> 01:47:25.326]  Well, the word is, the word is, the word is, it's JD Vance or Carson.
[01:47:26.696 --> 01:47:28.280]  Yeah, he put out that list.
[01:47:28.441 --> 01:47:29.724]  People are hoping for Vivek, though.
[01:47:30.065 --> 01:47:32.029]  You just don't think it's going to happen, Alex?
[01:47:33.152 --> 01:47:34.235]  Let her have her final comment.
[01:47:34.255 --> 01:47:35.097]  What were you going to say?
[01:47:37.628 --> 01:47:37.968]  Yeah.
[01:47:38.028 --> 01:47:40.310]  So I honestly, I'm not entirely sure.
[01:47:40.410 --> 01:47:41.511]  I'm hoping it's Vivek.
[01:47:41.631 --> 01:47:43.632]  I'm going to just keep my hopeful eye for now.
[01:47:43.692 --> 01:47:46.094]  But if it was Carson, I think he's trustworthy.
[01:47:46.114 --> 01:47:48.655]  He's just a kind of a quiet, softer spoken guy.
[01:47:48.715 --> 01:47:50.156]  So that makes me a little anxious.
[01:47:50.717 --> 01:47:57.221]  And, um, as for JD Vance, my only worries there are, he used to be a very strong never Trumper and you never know anymore.
[01:47:57.321 --> 01:48:00.163]  Like it just makes me a little bit anxious.
[01:48:00.423 --> 01:48:01.684]  I appreciate you.
[01:48:01.704 --> 01:48:02.164]  You're awesome.
[01:48:02.668 --> 01:48:03.889]  Thank you.
[01:48:03.949 --> 01:48:05.110]  Well, I ran into J.D.
[01:48:05.150 --> 01:48:14.135]  Vance, had a conversation with him at the TPUSA action event in Detroit, and we had an interesting conversation.
[01:48:14.155 --> 01:48:14.675]  I'll leave it at that.
[01:48:15.176 --> 01:48:18.297]  But the word is it's down to Carson and him.
[01:48:19.578 --> 01:48:22.480]  So what was your impression of him just man to man meeting him?
[01:48:23.701 --> 01:48:24.581]  It was you were there.
[01:48:24.601 --> 01:48:26.402]  Yeah, I saw it, but I wasn't in on the conversation.
[01:48:28.364 --> 01:48:33.644]   Just vibes. You know, I don't want to hurt the campaign because they'll use it. I'm not going
[01:48:33.644 --> 01:48:39.244]   to talk about it later. Makes sense. But I mean, he defended me when he was running for Senate.
[01:48:39.436 --> 01:48:40.236]  He defended me since.
[01:48:41.096 --> 01:48:42.697]  And so that takes a lot of guts.
[01:48:42.737 --> 01:48:45.638]  He's also been against the Ukraine war and a bunch of other stuff.
[01:48:45.678 --> 01:48:48.359]  So I know he wasn't perfect, you know, seven, eight years ago.
[01:48:48.379 --> 01:48:50.140]  And I get that.
[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:50.740]  Trump likes him.
[01:48:51.180 --> 01:48:51.360]  Yeah.
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:55.322]  So, um, had a very interesting discussion with him and his chief of staff.
[01:48:55.362 --> 01:48:55.862]  I'll leave it at that.
[01:48:55.882 --> 01:48:58.263]  But they, they're, they're, they're big listeners.
[01:48:58.783 --> 01:48:58.943]  Yeah.
[01:48:59.243 --> 01:49:01.084]  I mean, why does Vance defend me out of the blue?
[01:49:01.104 --> 01:49:06.769]   I mean, I think he gets, You see, instead of running from people attacked by the corporate media, we should run towards it.
[01:49:07.230 --> 01:49:12.295]  And they're now getting being an outlaw when you have a tyranny, then the patriots are outlaws.
[01:49:13.016 --> 01:49:13.797]  And that's what they get.
[01:49:13.877 --> 01:49:15.839]  Oh God, Trump's been indicted, now convicted.
[01:49:15.859 --> 01:49:16.439]  He's more popular.
[01:49:16.459 --> 01:49:17.781]  Like, well, we should have Alex Jones here.
[01:49:17.801 --> 01:49:24.944]   And of course, I was, you know, they admitted like the biggest like say I'm great that's why I'm going on tour with Tucker
[01:49:24.944 --> 01:49:27.913]   and that's a whole another story right there the stuff behind the scenes
[01:49:27.913 --> 01:49:31.184]   trying to stop that which only makes Tucker want me to be on tour with it more
[01:49:31.184 --> 01:49:35.154]   that'll be announced people that think all the attacks and CNN you know trying
[01:49:35.154 --> 01:49:38.094]   to get his tour shut down is gonna stop Tucker it's gonna make him only do more
[01:49:38.094 --> 01:49:41.023]   events I've got a lot of exciting things happening and it's not about me but
[01:49:41.023 --> 01:49:44.144]   it's about I've been so demonized because they're scared of what I actually
[01:49:44.144 --> 01:49:47.894]   say it's not the straw man they built it's actually what we're covering
[01:49:47.894 --> 01:49:49.904]  absolutely.
[01:49:49.823 --> 01:49:51.164]  Let's go to Harry Fisher.
[01:49:51.585 --> 01:49:53.786]  Harry Fisher, go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you have to say if you're with us.
[01:49:54.307 --> 01:49:55.147]  Hey, how's it going?
[01:49:55.267 --> 01:50:02.553]  I'm curious to see if CNN tries to utilize the shots, since Trump hasn't seemed to really demonize the shots.
[01:50:02.593 --> 01:50:04.374]  He has talked about not mandating it.
[01:50:04.855 --> 01:50:09.698]  I'm wondering if they're going to try to make him lose a little bit of his base by having him glorify it.
[01:50:10.499 --> 01:50:15.542]  You know, if I was them, I would use that against him, but because they're so in the pocket of Pfizer, I don't think they touch it.
[01:50:17.384 --> 01:50:18.024]  I'm just curious.
[01:50:18.044 --> 01:50:18.785]  You can't criticize them.
[01:50:20.186 --> 01:50:21.667]  That's a great angle.
[01:50:21.507 --> 01:50:22.946]  What else do you think is going to happen, Harry?
[01:50:22.946 --> 01:50:25.827]  That for sure.
[01:50:25.827 --> 01:50:29.627]   And then I've been wondering if they're going to actually even let him talk.
[01:50:29.627 --> 01:50:32.946]   If I was Donald Trump right now, I would be learning sign language.
[01:50:32.946 --> 01:50:35.747]   I mean, if they're going to shut your mic off, it'd be nice if we could just
[01:50:35.747 --> 01:50:39.866]   have someone just interpreting the stuff he's trying to say to Joe Biden while
[01:50:39.866 --> 01:50:42.026]  Joe Biden's just mumbling on stage.
[01:50:42.539 --> 01:50:46.182]  I think it's going to be well, you know, you know, if I had time, I haven't thought about this.
[01:50:46.202 --> 01:50:47.123]  I want to get a message to Trump.
[01:50:47.163 --> 01:50:51.186]  I can talk to him, but I don't know if Trump knows about acoustics, but Harry, let me put you on hold.
[01:50:51.206 --> 01:50:52.167]  Let me show you something right now.
[01:50:52.908 --> 01:50:53.949]  Guys, can you do this?
[01:50:53.969 --> 01:51:01.395]  I don't know if he turned my microphone off, which is similar to the lobs they're going to be wearing or the, the, the desk mics they're going to have.
[01:51:01.755 --> 01:51:03.497]  And I'm going to show you how.
[01:51:04.790 --> 01:51:06.753]  It doesn't stop you if they turn your mic off.
[01:51:07.094 --> 01:51:15.682]   So go ahead and turn my mic off Part of the same system we're not really set up to do that.
[01:51:15.682 --> 01:51:32.394]   Just tell me we can't we can't it's okay Yeah, I don't know if they're having a hard time hearing or
[01:51:32.394 --> 01:51:35.230]   what's going on Pre-studio is active.
[01:51:35.250 --> 01:51:50.817]  This is a special circumstance, so everybody's just... Okay, so... So... I want to show people that if you... If you turn this microphone off... It's not turned off, or it is turned off now?
[01:51:54.159 --> 01:51:55.880]  They're not talking to me, so I'm just gonna stop.
[01:51:58.601 --> 01:51:58.861]  Wow.
[01:51:59.021 --> 01:52:00.522]  Okay, so my mic is off.
[01:52:01.784 --> 01:52:02.164]  Is it off?
[01:52:02.764 --> 01:52:03.164]  Is it off?
[01:52:03.463 --> 01:52:04.662]  So my mic is off right now.
[01:52:04.662 --> 01:52:10.743]  Maybe we can try again later.
[01:52:10.926 --> 01:52:12.627]  No, I like this.
[01:52:12.647 --> 01:52:15.127]  I don't even know if Cat's got their tongues or what.
[01:52:15.207 --> 01:52:17.928]  I'm not worried about you guys.
[01:52:17.968 --> 01:52:18.908]  My mic is off.
[01:52:18.928 --> 01:52:18.908]  100%.
[01:52:19.148 --> 01:52:20.349]  My mic is off.
[01:52:20.369 --> 01:52:20.349]  100%.
[01:52:20.389 --> 01:52:20.849]  Thank you.
[01:52:22.128 --> 01:52:23.349]  Okay, so my mic's off.
[01:52:23.449 --> 01:52:24.830]  You can hear me right now, Chase.
[01:52:24.850 --> 01:52:24.910]  Yep.
[01:52:25.170 --> 01:52:26.411]  I want to show people this.
[01:52:26.792 --> 01:52:32.216]  So all Trump's got to do is look right where Biden is, 10 feet away, you're like 8 feet away, and say, you know what?
[01:52:32.236 --> 01:52:33.076]  You're full of crap.
[01:52:34.277 --> 01:52:34.818]  Don't sit there.
[01:52:34.858 --> 01:52:36.179]  You can't turn my mic off.
[01:52:36.239 --> 01:52:37.760]  They can't turn his mic off.
[01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:39.802]  I wanted to illustrate this to everybody.
[01:52:40.362 --> 01:52:50.750]  So, whenever Trump sees them cutting him off, he's stuck 30 seconds, Biden is 3 minutes, he needs to turn and say, Biden, your son's a crackhead, you're a communist Chinese agent, inflation's doubled under you, you're a fraud.
[01:52:51.519 --> 01:52:52.219]  Now you see that?
[01:52:53.260 --> 01:52:54.241]  That's the point I wanted to make.
[01:52:54.321 --> 01:52:56.222]  I'm just curious to ask a question.
[01:52:56.242 --> 01:52:57.482]  You know, I voted for Trump in 2016.
[01:52:57.523 --> 01:52:57.983]  I had high hopes.
[01:52:57.802 --> 01:52:59.403]  see if they mute both mics in that event.
[01:52:59.403 --> 01:53:02.403]   Just so you know, I think that's why they want total control.
[01:53:02.403 --> 01:53:02.942]  Yes.
[01:53:02.942 --> 01:53:05.122]  All right. Who's up next?
[01:53:05.122 --> 01:53:08.202]  Okay. Let's go next to health uncensored health uncensored.
[01:53:08.202 --> 01:53:09.721]  Go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you got to say.
[01:53:09.721 --> 01:53:13.162]  Um, I'm just curious to, uh, ask a question.
[01:53:13.162 --> 01:53:15.443]  Um, you know, I voted for Trump at 2016.
[01:53:15.443 --> 01:53:16.322]  I had high hopes.
[01:53:16.322 --> 01:53:19.481]   I thought it was going to be the change our country needed, you know, and,
[01:53:19.481 --> 01:53:20.882]  uh, bring changes to our government.
[01:53:20.882 --> 01:53:25.322]   Um, I think a big problem nowadays with what's going on in our country,
[01:53:25.322 --> 01:53:30.202]   especially since the COVID-19 pandemic is something known as regulatory capture.
[01:53:30.714 --> 01:53:33.576]  And, um, during Trump's presidency, I was disappointed.
[01:53:33.856 --> 01:53:37.478]  You know, um, he had a big pharma executive running the human health services.
[01:53:37.958 --> 01:53:40.960]  He had a lobbyist for the coal industry running the EPA.
[01:53:41.701 --> 01:53:49.565]  Uh, the man he appointed to run the FDA, Scott Gottlieb, went on to join the board of directors at Pfizer when he was done with his tenure in the, in the FDA.
[01:53:50.286 --> 01:53:51.614]   Um, Yeah, let me respond to that.
[01:53:51.434 --> 01:53:54.114]  for the telecom company Verizon running the FCC.
[01:53:54.114 --> 01:53:58.313]   So, you know, another one of those classic cases of, you know, the Fox
[01:53:58.313 --> 01:54:00.113]  guarding the hen house across the board.
[01:54:00.113 --> 01:54:04.953]   And, um, I'm just wondering, you know, there isn't much talk of them, but I
[01:54:04.953 --> 01:54:08.034]   was curious to hear Alex or Chase or any of the other speakers, what's
[01:54:08.034 --> 01:54:09.632]  your opinion on Bobby Kennedy Jr.
[01:54:09.632 --> 01:54:11.753]  Thanks for letting me ask a question.
[01:54:11.753 --> 01:54:13.873]  Yeah, let me respond to that.
[01:54:13.873 --> 01:54:19.673]   I think your criticism and your concerns about Trump is very well grounded.
[01:54:19.994 --> 01:54:22.994]  And I think it's very responsible.
[01:54:22.921 --> 01:54:24.242]  And I've been a big critic of Trump.
[01:54:24.742 --> 01:54:26.263]  And I'm not a lesser of two evils, guys.
[01:54:27.024 --> 01:54:33.888]  But the power structure in control now hates his guts, because he really tried to be the president and did what he thought was best.
[01:54:33.928 --> 01:54:34.688]  He made a lot of mistakes.
[01:54:35.328 --> 01:54:36.989]  And I know Trump well, people that know him well.
[01:54:37.390 --> 01:54:39.071]  He is his own man, you don't tell him what to do.
[01:54:39.411 --> 01:54:47.813]   But he has some weird understandings, almost autistic, has incredible energy, super smart in ways, but also You know, I mean, it would take two hours to explain it.
[01:54:48.153 --> 01:54:50.555]  He said hydroxychloroquine, he said ivermectin.
[01:54:51.435 --> 01:54:53.716]  They told him we can't open the country forever.
[01:54:53.736 --> 01:54:55.477]  And he said, well, that's going to cause a depression.
[01:54:55.497 --> 01:54:56.878]  So he said, speed everything up.
[01:54:57.158 --> 01:54:58.599]  And they went, well, here's this thing, sir.
[01:54:58.659 --> 01:54:59.379]  We can't speed it up.
[01:54:59.580 --> 01:55:00.500]  Well, they already had it ready.
[01:55:00.820 --> 01:55:01.801]  So they set him up.
[01:55:02.201 --> 01:55:03.342]  I wish he would expose that.
[01:55:03.402 --> 01:55:06.263]  I don't need him to say that because that's my theory.
[01:55:06.443 --> 01:55:07.264]  I know that happened.
[01:55:07.604 --> 01:55:08.504]  And Trump's pigheaded.
[01:55:08.544 --> 01:55:09.245]  That's why they hate him.
[01:55:09.285 --> 01:55:10.645]  He won't do what they say.
[01:55:10.665 --> 01:55:11.626]  He won't do what I say.
[01:55:12.333 --> 01:55:14.033]  So, on Warped Speed, you're totally right.
[01:55:14.774 --> 01:55:20.175]  All the time, Roger Stone pulls his hair out because Trump will be told by people, this is a good person who will endorse a bad person.
[01:55:20.735 --> 01:55:21.675]  Because it's complex.
[01:55:21.715 --> 01:55:22.536]  I mean, I do this.
[01:55:23.676 --> 01:55:26.057]  I mean, I work 15, 16 hours a day.
[01:55:26.077 --> 01:55:27.457]  I spend a couple hours with my children.
[01:55:27.537 --> 01:55:28.557]  I love to tell my children.
[01:55:28.897 --> 01:55:31.258]  But I'm trying to know all this constantly, and I'm 50.
[01:55:31.558 --> 01:55:34.119]  This is all I do, and I miss a lot of stuff.
[01:55:34.719 --> 01:55:34.959]  Okay?
[01:55:35.954 --> 01:55:37.875]  And so, imagine being the president.
[01:55:37.895 --> 01:55:39.355]  I've got, you know, 50-something employees.
[01:55:39.416 --> 01:55:47.359]  If they all weren't on my team, putting up with me, and kicking ass, and just really focusing on my vision, we couldn't do any of this.
[01:55:48.259 --> 01:55:50.620]  Well, imagine having hundreds of thousands of people under you.
[01:55:51.220 --> 01:55:56.342]  And so, even if they all want to pull in one direction, the government's full of all this scum.
[01:55:56.763 --> 01:55:58.203]  Now, let's take Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:55:58.243 --> 01:55:59.504]  He reportedly wants to come on the show now.
[01:55:59.544 --> 01:55:59.944]  That's great.
[01:55:59.984 --> 01:56:00.244]  Come on.
[01:56:01.673 --> 01:56:04.495]  Great on vaccines, great on the CIA, great on the New World Order.
[01:56:04.595 --> 01:56:07.856]  He's a very well-spoken guy that killed his father, that killed his uncle.
[01:56:07.936 --> 01:56:08.877]  You'd think he's on our side.
[01:56:09.858 --> 01:56:13.359]  But then he wants to arrest people that criticize climate change.
[01:56:14.180 --> 01:56:18.902]  And, you know, he's been for gun control and late-term abortion in the past.
[01:56:18.943 --> 01:56:21.244]  So, I like him as a person.
[01:56:21.264 --> 01:56:22.144]  I don't judge him.
[01:56:22.164 --> 01:56:24.265]  I just see Trump as way better.
[01:56:24.966 --> 01:56:26.667]  And I see RFK Jr.
[01:56:26.727 --> 01:56:31.791]   pulling more from Trump than my And I think RFK Jr.
[01:56:31.831 --> 01:56:34.993]  wants on the show now because he knows he's not getting the attention.
[01:56:35.013 --> 01:56:36.094]  He wants that controversy.
[01:56:36.134 --> 01:56:36.354]  Great.
[01:56:36.394 --> 01:56:37.014]  Come on the show.
[01:56:37.294 --> 01:56:38.295]  But I'll be honest about that.
[01:56:38.335 --> 01:56:40.196]  Now, would RFK Jr.
[01:56:40.256 --> 01:56:43.878]  be way better than Biden a trillion times?
[01:56:44.358 --> 01:56:45.919]  And maybe he'd prove himself.
[01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:49.621]  And maybe if he got elected president, he'd be better than Trump.
[01:56:49.801 --> 01:56:50.742]  But that's not going to happen.
[01:56:51.619 --> 01:56:55.660]  So he doesn't really count in the equation, so I've got Trump or Biden.
[01:56:56.060 --> 01:57:02.722]  And I can't morally, you don't have to hold my nose, and I've told Trump, I don't sit there and talk to Trump because his ass.
[01:57:02.742 --> 01:57:04.422]  I've told Trump, hey, will you stop telling me how great I am?
[01:57:04.442 --> 01:57:05.443]  That's what he does to his buddies.
[01:57:06.023 --> 01:57:08.023]  Will you get rid of these people in your administration?
[01:57:08.063 --> 01:57:08.644]  Will you do this?
[01:57:08.664 --> 01:57:09.084]  Will you do that?
[01:57:09.764 --> 01:57:12.665]  Alex, come on now, okay, well, just a moment, just a moment.
[01:57:13.005 --> 01:57:16.354]   And I'll say, hey, You got the CIA and your administration to bring you down.
[01:57:16.754 --> 01:57:17.495]  Of course, it all came out.
[01:57:17.555 --> 01:57:18.735]  That's why they're all listening.
[01:57:19.015 --> 01:57:20.495]  When I'm on the phone with him, you saw headlines.
[01:57:20.755 --> 01:57:23.956]  The number one mission, Washington Post, is to keep Alex Jones away from Trump.
[01:57:24.476 --> 01:57:27.796]  Because I was having law firms write memos to him.
[01:57:28.176 --> 01:57:29.337]  I was advising him.
[01:57:29.757 --> 01:57:30.577]  I was doing that.
[01:57:30.677 --> 01:57:31.917]  That's when they came after me.
[01:57:31.977 --> 01:57:34.077]  Not just what I do on air, but I did behind the scenes.
[01:57:34.117 --> 01:57:35.318]  So that's how real Trump is.
[01:57:35.338 --> 01:57:36.178]  He would listen to it.
[01:57:36.478 --> 01:57:37.318]  He'd say, send me that.
[01:57:37.858 --> 01:57:38.658]  And I'd send it to him.
[01:57:38.698 --> 01:57:39.478]  He would act on it.
[01:57:39.918 --> 01:57:41.619]  So I know he's for real.
[01:57:41.879 --> 01:57:42.879]  He would write executive orders.
[01:57:42.899 --> 01:57:43.759]  They throw them in the trash can.
[01:57:44.452 --> 01:57:53.635]  So, would you have somebody that means well and overall is a good guy, who the system hates, or a Crypt Keeper dementia patient?
[01:57:53.675 --> 01:57:59.537]  So, I get your issues about Trump, but would you rather have, I mean, I don't think we're going to get Kennedy.
[01:57:59.557 --> 01:58:00.497]  I don't think there's any way.
[01:58:00.517 --> 01:58:04.038]  I think Kennedy basically delivers it to Biden.
[01:58:04.118 --> 01:58:10.883]   So, yeah, you could, it appears, I mean, if I had to roll the dice, I'd probably go, okay, put Kennedy in, let's see what he does.
[01:58:11.483 --> 01:58:14.004]  Because, you know, you killed my dad, I don't think you can buy me off.
[01:58:14.264 --> 01:58:17.065]  I think, you know, I mean, yeah, okay, I think Kennedy's for real.
[01:58:17.565 --> 01:58:22.247]  But he kind of comes out of that leftist thing, you kind of can't help where the apple fell from the tree.
[01:58:22.927 --> 01:58:26.928]  Still, though, liberals used to be better in many ways, not this modern corporate black rock version.
[01:58:27.408 --> 01:58:29.169]  So, yeah, it's a 20 cost.
[01:58:29.949 --> 01:58:35.551]  If I could pick Trump or Biden, I don't know, Trump or RFK Jr., I would maybe flip a coin.
[01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:37.601]  But he doesn't do that.
[01:58:37.721 --> 01:58:38.461]  He's not going to win.
[01:58:38.481 --> 01:58:39.102]  Does that make sense?
[01:58:40.722 --> 01:58:41.523]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:58:41.543 --> 01:58:42.343]  I agree with you.
[01:58:42.363 --> 01:58:43.464]  I agree with everything you said.
[01:58:44.164 --> 01:58:46.866]  The question is, is RFK a viable candidate?
[01:58:47.026 --> 01:58:48.186]  Can he get up there and get the votes?
[01:58:49.007 --> 01:58:49.347]  I don't know.
[01:58:49.427 --> 01:58:50.228]  I kind of doubt that.
[01:58:50.408 --> 01:58:54.890]  And then it comes down to Trump or Biden, and obviously Trump's the obvious choice, you know?
[01:58:55.631 --> 01:59:04.896]  It's just other things, you know, as far as Trump didn't pardon Assange, he didn't pardon Edward Snowden, you know, the issues with his administration and regulatory capture.
[01:59:06.420 --> 01:59:12.523]  He talks a good game, but when it came down to when the rubber met the road, he really didn't pull through.
[01:59:12.823 --> 01:59:13.783]  He didn't drain the swamp.
[01:59:14.203 --> 01:59:15.964]  Well, that's because they distracted him.
[01:59:16.024 --> 01:59:21.427]  They cut out his best people, Bannon and Flynn, and then kept him destabilized.
[01:59:21.527 --> 01:59:27.629]  But that's why they're so scared now, because he will be not perfect, but 90% better than he was before.
[01:59:28.050 --> 01:59:28.810]  That's why they're so scared.
[01:59:28.830 --> 01:59:29.930]  Thank you so much.
[01:59:30.911 --> 01:59:32.792]  And I can make jokes all day about RFK Jr.
[01:59:32.812 --> 01:59:33.412]  and the brain worm.
[01:59:34.116 --> 01:59:37.137]  That ain't part of his brain, but at least he has a brain.
[01:59:37.157 --> 01:59:41.178]  Oh my goodness.
[01:59:41.458 --> 01:59:43.259]  Chase, who's up next?
[01:59:43.619 --> 01:59:45.220]  Let's go next to Chaz.
[01:59:45.260 --> 01:59:46.280]  Chaz, you've been waiting patiently.
[01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:48.041]  Go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you have to say, sir.
[01:59:51.882 --> 01:59:55.023]  Hey, is this working right now?
[01:59:55.843 --> 01:59:56.984]  Yeah, it's just a little echoey.
[01:59:57.144 --> 01:59:57.384]  Go on.
[01:59:58.744 --> 02:00:00.605]  All right.
[02:00:00.685 --> 02:00:01.505]  Sorry about that.
[02:00:01.645 --> 02:00:02.105]  Let's do this.
[02:00:02.145 --> 02:00:03.066]  We'll put you on hold.
[02:00:03.166 --> 02:00:03.446]  Hold on.
[02:00:03.466 --> 02:00:04.246]  We'll put you on hold.
[02:00:04.286 --> 02:00:05.887]  We're not going to send out bad audio.
[02:00:05.927 --> 02:00:07.387]  We want to talk to you, but you've got your speakers on.
[02:00:07.407 --> 02:00:08.047]  It's not going to work.
[02:00:08.568 --> 02:00:09.208]  Let me just say this.
[02:00:09.848 --> 02:00:12.429]  I've been up since 4 a.m.
[02:00:12.689 --> 02:00:12.989]  today.
[02:00:13.029 --> 02:00:14.510]  I went to bed at midnight last night.
[02:00:14.570 --> 02:00:15.450]  I slept four hours.
[02:00:16.010 --> 02:00:21.348]   And normally at 7 46, I'm at home in the pool with my I'm on it!
[02:00:21.168 --> 02:00:25.087]   two daughters are still living with me and my wife, or we're inside watching a show or
[02:00:25.087 --> 02:00:29.568]   listening to music or doing art or literally reading books, the Bible, you name it, okay?
[02:00:29.568 --> 02:00:36.208]   My seven-year-old reads at a college freshman level, and so she sits back and reads his books
[02:00:36.208 --> 02:00:40.288]   every night. I would be there right now and be ready to go to bed in three or four hours.
[02:00:40.288 --> 02:00:48.367]   I am on the edge of my seat about this in 13 minutes. I'm on the edge of my seat. I hope
[02:00:49.168 --> 02:00:53.408]   that instead of folks tuning into the CNN, God knows what they'll do, we're going to have the
[02:00:53.408 --> 02:01:01.328]   live CNN feed here on SpacesX with audio and @RealAlexJones and
[02:01:01.381 --> 02:01:07.786]  And if they cut the feed there, we're at InfoWars.com forward slash show and the live show feed at Man.Video.
[02:01:07.806 --> 02:01:11.329]  So both the feeds are on the front page of InfoWars.com.
[02:01:11.629 --> 02:01:16.293]  So for any reason, CNN files some fake takedown and they kill our feed coming up with this.
[02:01:16.952 --> 02:01:19.613]  You can go to Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:01:20.813 --> 02:01:29.616]  And you can find it right there on the front page, both the X feed and our feed at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:01:30.536 --> 02:01:32.176]  So I don't want to just have the X feed up there.
[02:01:32.196 --> 02:01:33.597]  I want to have our feed up there under it.
[02:01:33.657 --> 02:01:36.678]  And we've got that so people can find it because this is a big deal.
[02:01:36.718 --> 02:01:42.639]  Watch the Trump Biden debate here with commentary and analysis from Alex Jones, a special guest.
[02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:47.160]   And now let's see if that fella That feller has fixed his audio.
[02:01:47.340 --> 02:01:49.741]  Well, we lost him, so we're gonna have to move on to another speaker.
[02:01:49.801 --> 02:01:52.023]  Let's go to Robert the Builder for now.
[02:01:52.103 --> 02:01:54.084]  Robert, go ahead and unmute yourself and say what you got to say, sir.
[02:01:55.405 --> 02:01:55.906]  Good afternoon.
[02:01:55.986 --> 02:01:56.686]  Thank you, gentlemen.
[02:01:56.706 --> 02:01:57.847]  Thank you, Alex and Chase.
[02:01:58.908 --> 02:02:09.175]  Yeah, I think concerning the debate, I think it's really CNN versus Trump, you know, because I mean, and then I like to talk about tactics.
[02:02:09.455 --> 02:02:13.998]  It seems like to me what I've seen, you know, because I like to analyze things.
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:19.022]  And sometimes you have to, you can't say, you know, I think you're just a great person all the time.
[02:02:19.042 --> 02:02:21.723]  So I'm like, yeah, I try to look at what I'm doing wrong and stuff.
[02:02:21.763 --> 02:02:27.025]  But I think on the right, some of the problem we have is we, we, we telegraph our tactics.
[02:02:27.065 --> 02:02:29.766]  We're like an open book and the left isn't.
[02:02:29.786 --> 02:02:31.007]  They're very secretive.
[02:02:31.347 --> 02:02:38.670]  And just like we didn't know that they were going to use the mute, but they're start muting the, you know, all these little tricks that are coming out at the end.
[02:02:39.170 --> 02:02:39.910]  We didn't know about.
[02:02:39.930 --> 02:02:41.611]  They're going to mute people.
[02:02:41.631 --> 02:02:42.591]  They're going to mute the press.
[02:02:42.631 --> 02:02:43.152]  Excuse me.
[02:02:43.192 --> 02:02:44.092]  I get nervous sometimes.
[02:02:44.445 --> 02:02:46.637]  We're going to mute the president.
[02:02:48.573 --> 02:02:49.534]  And Biden, whatever.
[02:02:49.594 --> 02:02:51.896]  I call Trump the President, Biden whatever.
[02:02:52.076 --> 02:02:58.301]  Yes sir, we're going to go back to you in a moment, but we're only 9 or 10 minutes away from the debate that you will see right here.
[02:02:58.361 --> 02:02:59.722]  Stay with us, share the link right now.
[02:02:59.742 --> 02:03:01.083]  It's a revolutionary act.
[02:03:01.103 --> 02:03:05.926]  You've got the power to overpower AI, but Roger Stone is in West Virginia on the Tim Pool Show.
[02:03:06.447 --> 02:03:09.589]  He has ducked out to join us to give us a quick snapshot.
[02:03:10.010 --> 02:03:13.933]  He'll be joining us right after the debate ends at 9.30 Central.
[02:03:14.253 --> 02:03:15.554]  So will Robert Barnes of Analysis.
[02:03:16.614 --> 02:03:19.496]  Roger, I don't think I've ever been on the edge of my seat like this.
[02:03:19.556 --> 02:03:20.816]  What are you expecting tonight?
[02:03:22.417 --> 02:03:24.058]  Well, Alex, I'm right there with you.
[02:03:24.138 --> 02:03:26.639]  I mean, I don't think we know exactly what to expect.
[02:03:26.679 --> 02:03:27.600]  Look, here's what I know.
[02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:29.321]  Donald Trump is a natural.
[02:03:29.641 --> 02:03:32.102]  He has not spent days cramming for this.
[02:03:32.442 --> 02:03:37.184]  He doesn't do stage things with somebody playing Joe Biden in role play.
[02:03:37.324 --> 02:03:37.865]  That's not him.
[02:03:38.265 --> 02:03:39.646]  He knows what he wants to say.
[02:03:40.466 --> 02:03:45.428]   We've seen him vanquish 16 far more experienced politicians I think he's ready.
[02:03:45.448 --> 02:03:48.950]  I spoke to him about an hour and a half ago.
[02:03:48.789 --> 02:03:50.149]  doing these town halls.
[02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:55.949]   Remember the way he decimated that woman, Caitlin Collins, I think she's a woman anyway.
[02:03:55.949 --> 02:03:58.628]  He decimated her in that New Hampshire town hall.
[02:03:58.628 --> 02:03:59.869]  It was brutal.
[02:03:59.869 --> 02:04:02.469]  And she tried to challenge him and he took her apart.
[02:04:02.469 --> 02:04:04.029]  So I think he's ready.
[02:04:04.029 --> 02:04:06.309]  I spoke to him about an hour and a half ago.
[02:04:06.309 --> 02:04:08.029]  Guy is cool as a cucumber.
[02:04:08.029 --> 02:04:14.469]   I mean, it's just amazing the way he handles stress, the way he handles this high pressure atmosphere.
[02:04:14.502 --> 02:04:16.143]  So I'm optimistic.
[02:04:16.264 --> 02:04:23.805]   Now, I've got to tell you, Alex, in the 45 years I've been in American politics, I've never known a worse piece of crap than Jake Tapper.
[02:04:23.825 --> 02:04:26.668]  He literally is the lowest life form known to man.
[02:04:26.688 --> 02:04:30.412]  This is a guy who laughed online when he thought I was going to prison.
[02:04:30.652 --> 02:04:31.373]  Here's the good news.
[02:04:31.513 --> 02:04:36.399]  I'm still here and I'm free and he's in a failing network that is only being seen in airports.
[02:04:36.419 --> 02:04:36.940]  That's right.
[02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:38.281]  So you just talked to Trump.
[02:04:38.341 --> 02:04:39.943]  Talk more about how the big guy's doing.
[02:04:41.164 --> 02:04:47.408]  Well, I mean, look, I don't want to get into too many specifics, but I just called to wish him good luck and he said... Oh, I bet you gave him some advice!
[02:04:48.589 --> 02:04:50.551]  Well, if I did, I wouldn't say it here.
[02:04:51.191 --> 02:04:56.695]  Look, I'm just amazed at the way he compartmentalizes stress.
[02:04:56.735 --> 02:04:59.637]  This guy, you know, he's going to a high pressure atmosphere.
[02:04:59.997 --> 02:05:04.601]  This debate could completely and totally change the entire presidential race.
[02:05:05.481 --> 02:05:07.403]  And he just acts like it's another day.
[02:05:07.643 --> 02:05:09.024]  So I'm feeling pretty good.
[02:05:09.971 --> 02:05:17.218]  I thought in the beginning it was, you know, three on one, because you had Dana Bash, then you had Jake Tapper, and you got Joe Biden.
[02:05:17.238 --> 02:05:23.485]  But then I thought about it, it's really only two and a half on one, because Joe's not all there.
[02:05:25.406 --> 02:05:27.168]  But he is walking into a trap.
[02:05:27.228 --> 02:05:28.830]  Why do you think they're putting a big delay on it?
[02:05:29.310 --> 02:05:30.872]  Why do you think they've got mute buttons?
[02:05:30.952 --> 02:05:33.014]  I mean, that shows Biden's gonna be sitting down.
[02:05:35.635 --> 02:05:42.519]  Yeah, I mean, look, I think they're doing all that stuff because they know the guy that they've got to try to get across here is feeble.
[02:05:42.619 --> 02:05:44.240]  I mean, he can't take it.
[02:05:44.300 --> 02:05:46.702]  So they have to push Trump back.
[02:05:46.742 --> 02:05:49.563]  They're going to prop Joe up, which may be impossible.
[02:05:50.304 --> 02:05:58.529]  There is a strategy, and I'm not sure I disagree with this, of just letting Joe talk because he will fall back on fake stories that never really happened.
[02:05:59.129 --> 02:06:03.653]  Like the other day when he said, you know, when I came in, inflation was 9% now it's 1.4.
[02:06:03.793 --> 02:06:06.155]  No, it's the other way around, dummy.
[02:06:06.455 --> 02:06:09.417]  When Trump left, inflation was 1.4.
[02:06:09.718 --> 02:06:10.678]  It's at 9% today.
[02:06:11.199 --> 02:06:12.880]  This guy doesn't know which day of the week it is.
[02:06:12.900 --> 02:06:13.461]  Let me ask you this.
[02:06:13.561 --> 02:06:14.962]  Why do you think Biden agreed?
[02:06:15.002 --> 02:06:16.263]  I think it's total desperation.
[02:06:16.283 --> 02:06:21.467]  They're even admitting he's auditioning to not be removed at the DNC in Chicago.
[02:06:22.908 --> 02:06:24.849]  Actually, here's what I think the strategy was.
[02:06:25.469 --> 02:06:26.709]  They don't want Joe to debate.
[02:06:27.169 --> 02:06:37.131]  So they figured they would challenge Trump in a debate that he would never, ever, under any circumstance, agree to because it's a hostile network, it's a controlled situation.
[02:06:37.471 --> 02:06:43.153]  That would allow them to say for the rest of this campaign, look, we gave Trump his chance to debate and he wouldn't do it.
[02:06:43.513 --> 02:06:48.014]  He said anytime, anyplace, but then when we offered to do the CNN debate, he wouldn't do it.
[02:06:48.613 --> 02:06:51.775]  So I think Trump surprised them by agreeing.
[02:06:52.315 --> 02:06:53.676]  And the guy's a total brawler.
[02:06:53.736 --> 02:06:54.777]  I mean, he's fearless.
[02:06:54.817 --> 02:06:59.900]  So the rigged situation doesn't seem to bother him in the slightest.
[02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:01.961]  I think he called their bluff.
[02:07:02.281 --> 02:07:03.662]  They didn't really want this debate.
[02:07:03.922 --> 02:07:05.963]  They were certain he was going to turn this debate down.
[02:07:06.243 --> 02:07:07.564]  And of course, he didn't do that.
[02:07:07.864 --> 02:07:09.565]  Well, as usual, you're right on target.
[02:07:09.605 --> 02:07:14.588]  You said three years ago they would replace him at the DNC long before they announced Chicago.
[02:07:14.628 --> 02:07:15.889]  Now they're saying they're planning to do it.
[02:07:18.371 --> 02:07:20.733]  Yeah, I stick to my prediction, by the way.
[02:07:21.053 --> 02:07:22.334]  Just a small correction.
[02:07:22.994 --> 02:07:28.678]  I'm with our good friend, Luke Rudkowski, doing his show tonight, rather than with Tim Pool, another good man.
[02:07:29.058 --> 02:07:33.862]  I got a pending invitation from Tim, but Luke sends his best regards.
[02:07:33.982 --> 02:07:35.183]  Absolutely.
[02:07:35.223 --> 02:07:38.005]  They told me you're with Tim Pool, so the crew told me that, but they're great, too.
[02:07:38.325 --> 02:07:39.205]  It doesn't matter where you are.
[02:07:39.245 --> 02:07:41.107]  The point is, so where are you physically?
[02:07:41.147 --> 02:07:41.467]  In Florida?
[02:07:42.382 --> 02:07:44.563]  I'm in South Florida.
[02:07:44.904 --> 02:07:47.025]  I had to tune in to the Info Wars.
[02:07:47.085 --> 02:07:47.425]  Come on.
[02:07:47.465 --> 02:07:51.227]  It's because we are, in case you didn't know this, we're the tip of the spear.
[02:07:51.527 --> 02:07:54.009]  Well, join us after the debate tonight, OK?
[02:07:54.029 --> 02:07:54.749]  And bring Luke with you.
[02:07:55.830 --> 02:07:56.130]  All right.
[02:07:56.170 --> 02:07:57.091]  We will swing back in.
[02:07:57.311 --> 02:07:58.831]  Roger, 60 seconds.
[02:07:59.212 --> 02:08:00.212]  StoneZone.com.
[02:08:00.272 --> 02:08:03.014]  What else do you want to say about what we're about to see in five minutes?
[02:08:04.241 --> 02:08:07.523]  Uh, this is, this is as historic as the Nixon-Kennedy debate.
[02:08:07.843 --> 02:08:10.305]  This is as historic as the Reagan-Carter debate.
[02:08:10.645 --> 02:08:16.289]  What we see tonight could change the entire course of American, and therefore, world history.
[02:08:16.649 --> 02:08:18.951]  So like you, Alex, I'm on the edge of my seat.
[02:08:19.151 --> 02:08:22.513]  Anybody who tells you they know exactly what's going to happen tonight is full of crap.
[02:08:22.573 --> 02:08:27.256]  We won't know until it actually happens, but my money is on Donald J. Trump.
[02:08:27.517 --> 02:08:29.938]  All right, Roger, join us at 30 minutes after it ends.
[02:08:29.978 --> 02:08:31.980]  I'll be with Steven Crowder as well tonight.
[02:08:32.340 --> 02:08:33.260]  More Space is coming up.
[02:08:33.300 --> 02:08:34.061]  Thank you, Roger Stone.
[02:08:34.862 --> 02:08:35.862]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:08:35.862 --> 02:08:38.862]   All right, they always start these about three to five minutes late, but we got exactly
[02:08:38.862 --> 02:08:40.621]  five minutes till it starts.
[02:08:40.621 --> 02:08:45.181]   Here's a quick little clip of myself a week and a half ago in Detroit, and we'll come
[02:08:45.181 --> 02:08:48.141]   right back with live coverage of the live stream of the debate.
[02:08:48.141 --> 02:08:54.261]  Stay with us and share the links now.
[02:08:54.261 --> 02:09:15.862]  The answer to 19.
[02:09:15.824 --> 02:09:15.344]  1776!
[02:09:16.064 --> 02:09:27.864]  1776! 1776! 1776! 1776!
[02:09:27.864 --> 02:09:33.824]   So this fight for America is key, not just for us, but the entire world. Because if this
[02:09:33.824 --> 02:09:40.144]   republic falls, the entire world falls to the UN and the globalists and their hellish
[02:09:40.144 --> 02:09:46.344]   plan to literally take everything you've got, including your children, away from you. And
[02:09:46.344 --> 02:09:49.503]  whether it's Klaus Schwab or Bill Gates or Yuval Noah Harari...
[02:09:50.104 --> 02:09:56.806]  They represent the globalist ruling class of the planet who say the future is not human.
[02:09:57.106 --> 02:09:58.706]  Well, we got news for them!
[02:09:59.046 --> 02:10:01.046]  The future is not globalist!
[02:10:01.046 --> 02:10:10.166]  The future is human.
[02:10:10.409 --> 02:10:16.211]  The lies they spread about Alex, they've tried to take him out more than they've tried to take any of us out.
[02:10:16.795 --> 02:10:17.875]  Well, let me tell you what it is.
[02:10:17.915 --> 02:10:30.758]  What they'll never say is that Alex Jones has spent 30 years being the loudest voice for freedom, for liberty, and for anti-war that this world has seen.
[02:10:31.119 --> 02:10:34.859]  He stood against them, and that's why they're against him.
[02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:42.721]  They have tried to burn him to the ground, but he won't stop fighting.
[02:10:43.342 --> 02:10:44.962]  Let's launch Team Humanity!
[02:10:48.030 --> 02:10:49.311]  Team Humanity!
[02:10:52.513 --> 02:10:53.734]  Team Humanity!
[02:10:57.277 --> 02:10:59.539]  Are you going to let them brainwash and take your children?
[02:10:59.559 --> 02:10:59.759]  No!
[02:11:01.660 --> 02:11:10.667]  The answer to their 1984 anti-human, dehumanization world is humanity coming together and celebrating freedom that God gave us and saying no!
[02:11:10.867 --> 02:11:17.427]  The answer to 1984 is 1776!
[02:11:17.427 --> 02:11:21.667]  So I have a message to the globalists.
[02:11:21.843 --> 02:11:28.107]  I don't know how all this is going to end, but if you want to fight, you better believe you've got one!
[02:11:31.644 --> 02:11:33.965]  They declared war on us.
[02:11:34.766 --> 02:11:35.866]  They're attacking us.
[02:11:36.147 --> 02:11:37.247]  They're surveilling us.
[02:11:37.527 --> 02:11:38.648]  They're censoring us.
[02:11:38.888 --> 02:11:42.590]  They're cutting off our energy, our water, our communications, our freedom.
[02:11:42.890 --> 02:11:47.373]  We're simply recognizing it and saying, we're not going to roll over and die.
[02:11:47.813 --> 02:11:50.494]  Our God is the God of the universe that created it all.
[02:11:50.735 --> 02:11:52.435]  And your little God, Satan, is a loser.
[02:11:53.756 --> 02:11:59.041]  There is a global, worldwide, political realignment against the New World Order.
[02:11:59.241 --> 02:12:09.430]  The New World Order is a couple thousand arrogant people led by King Charles, who sits around and talks about how he wants to depopulate people, and so did his father, Prince Philip.
[02:12:09.871 --> 02:12:15.536]  And I'm telling them right now, we are not rolling over and dying for you inbred globalists.
[02:12:18.970 --> 02:12:22.409]  You will not divide and conquer us any longer.
[02:12:22.409 --> 02:12:26.409]  And as long as we never give up, we are invincible.
[02:12:26.409 --> 02:12:36.409]  [MUSIC]
[02:12:36.409 --> 02:12:46.409]  [MUSIC]
[02:12:46.409 --> 02:12:56.409]  [MUSIC]
[02:12:56.409 --> 02:13:08.009]  Old fashioned artillery.
[02:13:08.025 --> 02:13:09.025]  Genius.
[02:13:09.025 --> 02:13:31.025]   While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:13:30.851 --> 02:13:35.070]   Visit info wars.com forward slash show and share the link today
[02:13:35.070 --> 02:13:58.271]   Well the CIA is working overtime If you are receiving this transmission you are the
[02:13:58.271 --> 02:14:00.390]   resistance (upbeat music)
[02:14:00.491 --> 02:14:03.532]  Well, it's 8 central and 20 seconds, and that's not ridiculous.
[02:14:03.552 --> 02:14:06.213]  They're going to probably start the debate about five minutes late.
[02:14:06.293 --> 02:14:16.578]  Let's go ahead and pump the Communist News Network feed in and see what these enemies of the people are talking about as Trump marches into a trap in a lion's den.
[02:14:16.618 --> 02:14:16.998]  Here it is.
[02:14:18.382 --> 02:14:19.664]  ...the race for the White House.
[02:14:19.804 --> 02:14:21.626]  In just moments, the current U.S.
[02:14:21.666 --> 02:14:24.309]  President will debate the former U.S.
[02:14:24.349 --> 02:14:29.875]  President as their party's presumptive nominees, a first in American history.
[02:14:30.476 --> 02:14:35.781]  We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world to our studios in Atlanta.
[02:14:36.262 --> 02:14:38.905]  This is the CNN Presidential Debate.
[02:14:40.072 --> 02:14:46.996]  This debate is being produced by CNN and is coming to you live on CNN, CNN International, CNN.com.
[02:14:47.056 --> 02:14:47.657]  That's enough.
[02:14:47.937 --> 02:14:48.397]  CNN Max.
[02:14:48.617 --> 02:14:50.979]  Yeah, it must be nice for them to actually have viewers again.
[02:14:50.999 --> 02:14:53.540]  This is going to have probably more viewers than the Super Bowl.
[02:14:54.341 --> 02:15:00.805]  Let's go back to these two kleptocrats, these two teleprompter readers who have this lion marching into their den of hyenas.
[02:15:00.825 --> 02:15:01.325]  Go back to them.
[02:15:03.606 --> 02:15:04.467]  Until Election Day.
[02:15:05.700 --> 02:15:10.982]  Good evening, I'm Dana Bash, anchor of CNN's Inside Politics and co-anchor of State of the Union.
[02:15:11.303 --> 02:15:15.004]  I'm Jake Tapper, anchor of CNN's The Lead and co-anchor of State of the Union.
[02:15:15.404 --> 02:15:17.605]  Dana and I will co-moderate this evening.
[02:15:17.665 --> 02:15:22.647]  Our job is to facilitate a debate between the two candidates tonight.
[02:15:23.128 --> 02:15:26.929]  Before we introduce them, we want to share the rules of the debate with the audience at home.
[02:15:27.470 --> 02:15:30.131]  Former President Trump will be on the left side of the screen.
[02:15:30.451 --> 02:15:32.592]  President Biden will be appearing on the right.
[02:15:32.732 --> 02:15:35.193]  A coin toss determines their positions.
[02:15:35.834 --> 02:15:42.039]  Each candidate will have two minutes to answer a question and one minute each for responses and rebuttals.
[02:15:42.559 --> 02:15:48.484]  An additional minute for follow-up clarification or response is at the moderator's discretion.
[02:15:48.864 --> 02:15:55.830]  When it's time for a candidate to speak, his microphone will be turned on and his opponent's microphone will be turned off.
[02:15:56.470 --> 02:16:02.715]  Should a candidate interrupt when his microphone is muted, he will be difficult to understand for viewers at home.
[02:16:03.539 --> 02:16:07.540]  At the end of the debate, each candidate will get two minutes for closing statements.
[02:16:08.041 --> 02:16:10.081]  There is no studio audience tonight.
[02:16:10.481 --> 02:16:15.603]  Pre-written notes, props, or contact with campaign staff are not permitted during the debate.
[02:16:16.203 --> 02:16:22.826]  By accepting our invitation to debate, both candidates and their campaigns agreed to accept these rules.
[02:16:23.566 --> 02:16:27.627]  Now, please welcome the 46th President of the United States, Joe Biden.
[02:16:27.687 --> 02:16:28.928]  Who stole the election!
[02:16:29.908 --> 02:16:31.509]  Folks, how are you?
[02:16:31.549 --> 02:16:32.089]  Folks, how are you?
[02:16:33.195 --> 02:16:33.775]  Where do I go?
[02:16:33.795 --> 02:16:34.456]  I don't even know.
[02:16:35.776 --> 02:16:38.218]  He's jacked up on probably 10 Adderalls right now.
[02:16:39.899 --> 02:16:40.659]  Look at that joke!
[02:16:40.679 --> 02:16:44.701]  Please welcome the 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump.
[02:16:47.923 --> 02:16:50.064]  Those of you who can hear Biden say, thank you, thank you.
[02:16:50.104 --> 02:16:51.625]  His mic, Trump's mic's turned off.
[02:16:51.685 --> 02:16:52.345]  Notice the key.
[02:16:52.765 --> 02:16:53.986]  Biden walks out, his mic's turned on.
[02:16:56.112 --> 02:16:57.593]  Gentlemen, thanks so much for being here.
[02:16:57.633 --> 02:17:04.474]  Let's begin the debate, and let's start with the issue that voters consistently say is their top concern, the economy.
[02:17:05.014 --> 02:17:09.075]  President Biden, inflation has slowed, but prices remain high.
[02:17:09.596 --> 02:17:12.556]  Since you took office, the price of essential goods has increased.
[02:17:12.996 --> 02:17:15.957]  For example, a basket of groceries that cost $100 then, now costs more than $120.
[02:17:15.796 --> 02:17:21.356]   then now costs more than $120 and typical home prices have jumped more
[02:17:21.356 --> 02:17:25.916]   than 30%. What do you say to voters who feel they are worse off under your
[02:17:25.916 --> 02:17:30.276]  presidency than they were under President Trump?
[02:17:28.742 --> 02:17:33.083]  I've got to take a look at what I was left when I became president and what Mr. Trump left me.
[02:17:33.643 --> 02:17:35.423]  We had an economy that was in freefall.
[02:17:36.003 --> 02:17:37.724]  Pandemic was so badly handled.
[02:17:38.324 --> 02:17:39.344]  Many people were dying.
[02:17:39.404 --> 02:17:41.084]  All he said was it's not that serious.
[02:17:41.564 --> 02:17:44.385]  I guarantee you Biden has had the Lance Armstrong treatment.
[02:17:44.605 --> 02:17:45.525]  Economy collapsed.
[02:17:45.945 --> 02:17:46.905]  Blood doping.
[02:17:47.365 --> 02:17:48.346]  Unemployment rose.
[02:17:48.366 --> 02:17:48.766]  Plumped.
[02:17:48.585 --> 02:17:51.865]  plumped up, looks like he gained 10 pounds.
[02:17:51.865 --> 02:17:54.745]  They probably pumped five bags of blood into him.
[02:17:54.745 --> 02:17:56.545]  That's why he's been away for a week.
[02:17:56.545 --> 02:18:00.825]   15,000 new jobs that we brought out and I have a physician where--
[02:18:00.825 --> 02:18:02.665]  Probably got like 10 year old blood.
[02:18:02.043 --> 02:18:03.023]  That's what the rich people do.
[02:18:03.344 --> 02:18:04.264]  But there's more to be done.
[02:18:04.284 --> 02:18:04.824]  Come on, Joe.
[02:18:04.844 --> 02:18:05.584]  There's more to be done.
[02:18:05.604 --> 02:18:07.785]  He's got five bags of 10-year-old blood.
[02:18:07.985 --> 02:18:09.405]  I come from Scranton, Pennsylvania.
[02:18:09.465 --> 02:18:13.707]  I come from a household where the kitchen tables and things weren't able to be met during the month.
[02:18:13.767 --> 02:18:14.647]  It was a problem.
[02:18:14.667 --> 02:18:18.888]  The price of eggs, the price of gas, the price of housing, the price of a whole range of things.
[02:18:19.349 --> 02:18:23.910]  That's why I'm working so hard to make sure I deal with those problems and we're going to make sure.
[02:18:26.715 --> 02:18:31.835]   we build two million new units. We're going to make sure we cap rents so corporate greed can't
[02:18:31.835 --> 02:18:36.954]   take over. I was left with corporate greed is the reason why we're in this problem right now.
[02:18:36.954 --> 02:18:41.755]   In addition to that, we're in a situation where if you had to take a look at all that was done
[02:18:41.755 --> 02:18:47.273]   in his administration, he didn't do much at all. By the time he left, things were in chaos.
[02:18:47.273 --> 02:18:51.594]   It was literally chaos. And so we put things back together and created a nice thing.
[02:18:51.683 --> 02:18:52.303]  Oh yeah, all the wars.
[02:18:52.323 --> 02:18:53.904]  The $15 for an insulin shot as opposed to $400.
[02:18:53.944 --> 02:18:57.926]  No senior has to pay more than $200 for any drug, all the drugs they could include beginning next year.
[02:18:57.805 --> 02:18:59.805]  Oh yeah, all the wars.
[02:18:59.805 --> 02:19:04.805]  The $15 for an insulin shot as opposed to $400.
[02:19:04.805 --> 02:19:11.805]   No senior has to pay more than $200 for any drug, all the drugs they conclude beginning next year.
[02:19:11.805 --> 02:19:16.805]   And the situation is making, and we're going to make that available to everybody, to all Americans.
[02:19:16.805 --> 02:19:19.805]   So we're working to bring down the prices around the kitchen table.
[02:19:19.508 --> 02:19:21.029]  That's what we're going to get done.
[02:19:21.970 --> 02:19:22.830]  Thank you, President Trump.
[02:19:23.611 --> 02:19:26.193]  We have the greatest economy in the history of our country.
[02:19:27.033 --> 02:19:28.954]  We have never done so well.
[02:19:30.215 --> 02:19:31.876]  Everybody was amazed by it.
[02:19:31.936 --> 02:19:33.277]  Other countries were copying us.
[02:19:33.337 --> 02:19:35.059]  We got hit with COVID.
[02:19:35.879 --> 02:19:41.803]  And when we did, we spent the money necessary so we wouldn't end up in a Great Depression, the likes of which we had in 1929.
[02:19:43.390 --> 02:19:45.311]  By the time we finished, we did a great job.
[02:19:45.351 --> 02:19:50.854]  We got a lot of credit for the economy, a lot of credit for the military, and no wars, and so many other things.
[02:19:51.014 --> 02:19:52.255]  Everything was rocking good.
[02:19:52.735 --> 02:19:57.257]  But the thing we never got the credit for, and we should have, is getting us out of that COVID mess.
[02:19:58.098 --> 02:20:10.705]  He created mandates that was a disaster for our country, but other than that, we had given them back a country where the stock market actually was higher than pre-COVID, and nobody thought that was even possible.
[02:20:11.365 --> 02:20:15.414]   The only jobs he created are for Illegal immigrants and bounce back jobs.
[02:20:15.474 --> 02:20:16.694]  A bounce back from the COVID.
[02:20:17.215 --> 02:20:18.515]  He has not done a good job.
[02:20:18.555 --> 02:20:20.996]  He's done a poor job and inflation's killing our country.
[02:20:21.196 --> 02:20:22.537]  It is absolutely killing us.
[02:20:23.437 --> 02:20:23.777]  Thank you.
[02:20:23.797 --> 02:20:24.397]  President Biden?
[02:20:25.258 --> 02:20:26.798]  Oh look, the greatest economy in the world.
[02:20:26.818 --> 02:20:28.479]  He's the only one who thinks that, I think.
[02:20:28.499 --> 02:20:31.340]  I don't know anybody else who thinks he has the greatest economy in the world.
[02:20:32.060 --> 02:20:42.505]  And, you know, the fact of the matter is that we find ourselves in a situation where his economy... Went from the number three energy producer to number one overnight.
[02:20:43.629 --> 02:20:44.330]  That's not true.
[02:20:44.350 --> 02:20:45.210]  That's a total lie!
[02:20:45.029 --> 02:20:47.829]   There is a deficit larger than any president has in any one term.
[02:20:47.829 --> 02:20:48.829]  That's not true.
[02:20:48.829 --> 02:20:52.269]   He's the only president other than Herbert Hoover who's had lost more jobs than he has
[02:20:52.269 --> 02:20:53.269]  been.
[02:20:53.269 --> 02:20:54.269]  That's a total lie.
[02:20:54.269 --> 02:20:57.429]  The deficit's been the biggest ever under Biden.
[02:20:57.429 --> 02:21:02.829]   And the military, you know, when he was president, they were still killing people in Afghanistan.
[02:21:02.829 --> 02:21:04.149]  He didn't do anything about that.
[02:21:04.144 --> 02:21:06.006]  He did the horrible withdrawal!
[02:21:06.066 --> 02:21:06.907]  Biden did that!
[02:21:07.508 --> 02:21:07.988]  Wow!
[02:21:08.268 --> 02:21:11.252]  The notion that we were this safe country.
[02:21:11.392 --> 02:21:12.353]  I'm so full of crap.
[02:21:12.774 --> 02:21:20.423]  I'm the only president this century that doesn't have any, this decade, that done any troops dying anywhere in the world.
[02:21:20.583 --> 02:21:20.783]  What?
[02:21:20.823 --> 02:21:21.324]  Like he did.
[02:21:22.609 --> 02:21:25.090]  President Trump, I want to follow up if I can.
[02:21:25.110 --> 02:21:26.510]  Am I allowed to respond to him?
[02:21:26.530 --> 02:21:27.791]  Well, I'm going to ask you a follow-up.
[02:21:27.831 --> 02:21:29.572]  You can do whatever you want with the minute that we give you.
[02:21:29.772 --> 02:21:31.032]  I want to follow up.
[02:21:31.272 --> 02:21:34.853]  You want to impose a 10% tariff on all goods coming into the U.S.
[02:21:35.414 --> 02:21:38.195]  How will you ensure that that doesn't drive prices even higher?
[02:21:38.215 --> 02:21:39.355]  It's not going to drive them higher.
[02:21:39.375 --> 02:21:44.997]  It's just going to cost countries that have been ripping us off for years, like China and many others, in all fairness to China.
[02:21:45.492 --> 02:21:49.575]  It's going to just force them to pay us a lot of money, reduce our deficit tremendously.
[02:21:49.816 --> 02:21:50.716]  You see the cheating though?
[02:21:50.736 --> 02:21:51.737]  They didn't give the follow-up.
[02:21:51.837 --> 02:21:52.017]  See?
[02:21:52.037 --> 02:21:52.598]  They're doing it.
[02:21:52.678 --> 02:21:53.539]  He made a statement.
[02:21:53.599 --> 02:21:57.542]  The only thing he was right about is I gave you the largest tax cut in history.
[02:21:57.582 --> 02:22:00.024]  I also gave you the largest regulation cut in history.
[02:22:00.044 --> 02:22:01.345]  That's why we had all the jobs.
[02:22:01.705 --> 02:22:05.568]  And the jobs went down and then they bounced back and he's taking credit for bounce back jobs.
[02:22:05.588 --> 02:22:06.289]  You can't do that.
[02:22:06.669 --> 02:22:08.651]  He also said he inherited 9% inflation.
[02:22:08.671 --> 02:22:08.711]  No.
[02:22:10.270 --> 02:22:13.873]  He inherited almost no inflation and it stayed that way for 14 months.
[02:22:13.913 --> 02:22:14.393]  Good job, Trump.
[02:22:14.413 --> 02:22:21.298]  And then it blew up under his leadership because he spent money like a bunch of people that didn't know what they were doing and they don't know what they were doing.
[02:22:21.318 --> 02:22:24.280]  It was the worst, probably the worst administration in history.
[02:22:24.540 --> 02:22:25.221]  There's never been.
[02:22:25.521 --> 02:22:33.227]  And as far as Afghanistan is concerned, I was getting out of Afghanistan, but we're getting out with dignity, with strength, with power.
[02:22:33.827 --> 02:22:34.387]  He got out.
[02:22:34.468 --> 02:22:37.290]  It was the most embarrassing day in the history of our country's life.
[02:22:37.310 --> 02:22:37.890]  Trump's nailing it.
[02:22:38.447 --> 02:22:44.432]  President Trump, over the last eight years, under both of your administrations, the national debt soared to record highs.
[02:22:44.892 --> 02:22:54.039]  And according to a new nonpartisan analysis, President Trump, your administration approved $8.4 trillion in new debt, while so far, President Biden, you've approved $4.3 trillion in new debt.
[02:22:55.720 --> 02:23:00.801]  So, former President Trump, many of the tax cuts that you signed into law are set to expire next year.
[02:23:01.202 --> 02:23:03.562]  You want to extend them and go even further, you say.
[02:23:04.002 --> 02:23:04.723]  With the U.S.
[02:23:04.783 --> 02:23:12.605]  facing trillion-dollar deficits and record debt, why should top earners and corporations pay even less in taxes than they do now?
[02:23:12.625 --> 02:23:17.126]  Because the tax cuts spurred the greatest economy that we've ever seen just prior to COVID.
[02:23:17.146 --> 02:23:18.226]  Just like right after COVID.
[02:23:18.306 --> 02:23:20.327]  It was so strong that we were able to get through COVID.
[02:23:20.723 --> 02:23:22.784]  Much better than just about any other country.
[02:23:23.224 --> 02:23:25.025]  But we spurred, that tax spurred.
[02:23:25.085 --> 02:23:32.987]  Now, when we cut the taxes, as an example, the corporate tax was cut down to 21% from 39%, plus beyond that.
[02:23:33.108 --> 02:23:33.648]  Brings it back.
[02:23:33.668 --> 02:23:39.970]  We took in more revenue with much less tax, and companies were bringing back trillions of dollars back into our country.
[02:23:40.410 --> 02:23:42.931]  The country was going like never before.
[02:23:43.391 --> 02:23:48.053]  And we were ready to start paying down debt, we were ready to start using the liquid gold right under our feet.
[02:23:48.513 --> 02:23:49.934]  China had a 5% tax, we had a 30% plus.
[02:23:49.773 --> 02:23:53.612]  China had a 5% tax, we had a 30% plus.
[02:23:53.612 --> 02:23:56.213]  We got hit with COVID, we did a lot to fix it.
[02:23:56.213 --> 02:24:01.532]   I gave him an unbelievable situation with all of the therapeutics and all of the things
[02:24:01.532 --> 02:24:03.372]  that we came up with.
[02:24:03.372 --> 02:24:04.894]  We gave him something great.
[02:24:04.894 --> 02:24:07.933]  Remember, more people died under his administration.
[02:24:07.933 --> 02:24:11.394]   Trump isn't pushing the shot, he's pushing therapeutics, that's good.
[02:24:11.394 --> 02:24:15.492]   More people died under his administration than our administration, and we were right
[02:24:15.492 --> 02:24:16.333]  in the middle of it.
[02:24:16.539 --> 02:24:18.779]  Something which a lot of people don't like to talk about.
[02:24:19.119 --> 02:24:22.140]  But he had far more people dying in his administration.
[02:24:22.481 --> 02:24:25.121]  He did the mandate, which is a disaster, mandating it.
[02:24:27.222 --> 02:24:31.844]  We're like a third world nation between weaponization of his election, trying to go after his political opponent.
[02:24:31.663 --> 02:24:35.343]  I did a very poor job, just a very poor job.
[02:24:35.343 --> 02:24:39.143]   And I will tell you, not only poor there, but throughout the entire world, we're no
[02:24:39.143 --> 02:24:41.143]  longer respected as a country.
[02:24:41.143 --> 02:24:42.823]  They don't respect our leadership.
[02:24:42.823 --> 02:24:45.182]  They don't respect the United States anymore.
[02:24:45.182 --> 02:24:50.743]   We're like a third world nation between weaponization of his election, trying to go after his political
[02:24:50.743 --> 02:24:55.382]   opponent, all of the things he's done, we've become like a third world nation.
[02:24:55.382 --> 02:24:56.143]  And it's a shame.
[02:24:56.495 --> 02:25:08.461]  The damage he's done to our country, and I'd love to ask him and Will why he allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons, jails, and mental institutions to come into our country and destroy our country.
[02:25:09.102 --> 02:25:12.263]  President Trump, we will get to immigration later in this block.
[02:25:12.343 --> 02:25:16.546]  President Biden, I want to give you an opportunity to respond to this question about the national debt.
[02:25:17.266 --> 02:25:20.608]  He had the largest national debt of any president in a four-year period, number one.
[02:25:21.283 --> 02:25:25.689]  Number two, you've got a two trillion dollar tax cut that benefits the very wealthy.
[02:25:26.490 --> 02:25:28.253]  What I'm going to do is fix the tax system.
[02:25:28.293 --> 02:25:31.277]  For example, we have a thousand billionaires in America.
[02:25:35.618 --> 02:25:39.138]  where they in fact pay 8.2% in taxes.
[02:25:39.138 --> 02:25:46.578]   If they just paid 24%, 25%, either one of those numbers, they've raised $500 million, billion dollars,
[02:25:46.578 --> 02:25:48.738]  I should say, in a 10-year period.
[02:25:48.738 --> 02:25:52.378]   We'd be able to wipe out his debt, we'd be able to help make sure that all those--
[02:25:52.378 --> 02:25:54.578]  No, he's moved to another country, which is a plan.
[02:25:54.578 --> 02:25:58.977]   Eldercare, making sure that we continue to strengthen our healthcare system,
[02:25:58.977 --> 02:26:03.378]   making sure that we're able to make every single solitary person eligible.
[02:26:03.957 --> 02:26:12.357]   eligible for what I've been able to do with dealing with everything we have to do with
[02:26:12.357 --> 02:26:13.357]  COVID.
[02:26:13.357 --> 02:26:21.357]  Thank you, President Biden.
[02:26:21.357 --> 02:26:22.357]  President Trump?
[02:26:23.158 --> 02:26:24.239]  He did beat Medicare.
[02:26:24.259 --> 02:26:25.099]  He beat it to death.
[02:26:25.199 --> 02:26:26.461]  And he's destroying Medicare.
[02:26:26.961 --> 02:26:29.143]  Because all of these people are coming in.
[02:26:29.484 --> 02:26:30.805]  They're putting them on Medicare.
[02:26:30.825 --> 02:26:32.847]  They're putting them on Social Security.
[02:26:32.887 --> 02:26:34.649]  They're going to destroy Social Security.
[02:26:34.689 --> 02:26:38.092]  This man is going to single-handedly destroy Social Security.
[02:26:38.112 --> 02:26:40.494]  And remember, Biden runs the Justice Department.
[02:26:40.795 --> 02:26:43.617]  They're trying to put Trump in jail right now and take him out of the ballot.
[02:26:43.878 --> 02:26:45.920]  They are getting their ass kicked right now.
[02:26:45.940 --> 02:26:47.261]  I'm sorry, I'm going to stop talking, but here it is.
[02:26:48.066 --> 02:26:50.268]  In the way he finished that sentence, and it's a shame.
[02:26:50.588 --> 02:26:55.152]  What's happened to our country in the last four years is not to be believed.
[02:26:55.553 --> 02:27:01.378]  Foreign countries, I'm friends with a lot of people, they cannot believe what happened to the United States of America.
[02:27:01.458 --> 02:27:02.639]  We're no longer respected.
[02:27:03.440 --> 02:27:05.221]  Biden's probably pooping himself right now.
[02:27:05.241 --> 02:27:07.163]  I'm serious, he craps himself.
[02:27:07.463 --> 02:27:09.265]  I believe he'll shit himself tonight.
[02:27:09.104 --> 02:27:12.463]   People, what we're doing for other countries- When Biden leaves the stage,
[02:27:12.463 --> 02:27:16.863]   he will be shitting his pants. But this man has done- >> What he's doing right now. >> Absolutely criminal.
[02:27:16.863 --> 02:27:18.703]  That's the poop face. Thank you, President Trump.
[02:27:18.703 --> 02:27:24.244]   Will he squat? This is the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned Roe
[02:27:24.244 --> 02:27:30.334]   v Wade. This morning, the court ruled on yet another abortion case, temporarily
[02:27:30.334 --> 02:27:36.504]   allowing emergency abortions to continue in Idaho, despite that state's restrictive ban.
[02:27:36.504 --> 02:27:41.503]   Former President Trump, you take credit for the decision to overturn Roe v Wade,
[02:27:41.503 --> 02:27:45.183]   which- >> President Trump has the Biden's butt been wiped.
[02:27:45.287 --> 02:27:52.148]  However, the federal government still plays a role in whether or not women have access to abortion pills.
[02:27:53.389 --> 02:27:56.629]  They're used in about two-thirds of all abortions.
[02:27:57.450 --> 02:28:00.630]  As president, would you block abortion medication?
[02:28:01.190 --> 02:28:08.672]  First of all, the Supreme Court just approved the abortion pill, and I agree with their decision to have done that, and I will not block it.
[02:28:09.384 --> 02:28:15.366]  And if you look at this whole question that you're asking, a complex but not really complex.
[02:28:15.566 --> 02:28:20.428]  51 years ago, you had Roe v. Wade and everybody wanted to get it back to the states.
[02:28:20.548 --> 02:28:21.768]  Everybody, without exception.
[02:28:21.828 --> 02:28:24.229]  Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives.
[02:28:24.869 --> 02:28:25.890]  Everybody wanted it back.
[02:28:25.950 --> 02:28:26.870]  Religious leaders.
[02:28:27.623 --> 02:28:35.191]  And what I did is I put three great Supreme Court justices on the court, and they happened to vote in favor of killing Roe v. Wade.
[02:28:35.211 --> 02:28:36.432]  I'm not supposed to have notes?
[02:28:36.472 --> 02:28:38.334]  He's got a phone or something, he's reading notes.
[02:28:38.354 --> 02:28:39.856]  Or he's got an earpiece.
[02:28:40.276 --> 02:28:51.534]   Now, ten years ago or so, they started talking about how many weeks and how many this, getting into other things, but every legal scholar Throughout the world, the most respected, wanted it brought back to the states.
[02:28:51.674 --> 02:28:52.154]  I did that.
[02:28:52.595 --> 02:28:54.336]  Now the states are working it out.
[02:28:54.396 --> 02:29:00.139]  If you look at Ohio, it was a decision that was, it was an end result that was a little bit more liberal than you would have thought.
[02:29:00.759 --> 02:29:02.420]  Kansas, I would say the same thing.
[02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:04.121]  Texas is different.
[02:29:04.141 --> 02:29:05.041]  Florida is different.
[02:29:05.361 --> 02:29:07.622]  But they're all making their own decisions right now.
[02:29:08.003 --> 02:29:10.164]  And right now, the states control it.
[02:29:10.204 --> 02:29:11.564]  That's the vote of the people.
[02:29:12.205 --> 02:29:15.006]  Like Ronald Reagan, I believe in the exceptions.
[02:29:15.126 --> 02:29:16.487]  I am a person that believes.
[02:29:17.074 --> 02:29:19.895]  And frankly, I think it's important to believe in the exceptions.
[02:29:19.935 --> 02:29:21.275]  Some people, you have to follow your heart.
[02:29:21.295 --> 02:29:22.516]  Some people don't believe in that.
[02:29:23.136 --> 02:29:27.957]  But I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.
[02:29:28.057 --> 02:29:29.058]  I think it's very important.
[02:29:29.558 --> 02:29:32.899]  Some people don't follow your heart, but you have to get elected also.
[02:29:33.199 --> 02:29:35.420]  And because that has to do with other things.
[02:29:35.460 --> 02:29:36.260]  You got to get elected.
[02:29:36.740 --> 02:29:43.903]   The problem they have is they're radical because they will Take the life of a child in the 8th month, the 9th month, and even after birth.
[02:29:44.123 --> 02:29:48.665]  After birth, if you look at the former governor of Virginia, he was willing to do this.
[02:29:48.986 --> 02:29:53.988]  He said, we'll put the baby aside and we'll determine what we do with the baby, meaning we'll keep him comfortable.
[02:29:55.129 --> 02:30:00.331]  What happened is we brought it back to the states and the country is now... Pull up Virginia governor and keep baby comfortable.
[02:30:00.431 --> 02:30:01.572]  It's been a great thing.
[02:30:05.953 --> 02:30:10.216]  The fact is that the vast majority of constitutional scholars supported Roe when it was decided.
[02:30:10.816 --> 02:30:11.537]  Supported Roe.
[02:30:12.297 --> 02:30:16.060]  And that's this idea that they're all against it is just ridiculous.
[02:30:16.600 --> 02:30:18.882]  And this is the guy who says the state should be able to have it.
[02:30:19.122 --> 02:30:29.864]   We're in a state where in six weeks, you don't even know whether you're pregnant or not, but you cannot see a doctor, have your And have him decide on what your circumstances are when you need help.
[02:30:30.345 --> 02:30:35.548]  The idea that states are able to do this is a little like saying, we're going to turn civil rights back to the states.
[02:30:35.868 --> 02:30:37.309]  That each state have a different role.
[02:30:37.949 --> 02:30:42.212]  Look, there's so many young women who have been, including the young woman who just was murdered.
[02:30:45.331 --> 02:30:50.374]  The idea that she was murdered by an immigrant coming in.
[02:30:50.854 --> 02:30:52.735]  They talk about that, but here's the deal.
[02:30:53.096 --> 02:31:00.400]  There's a lot of young women being raped by their in-laws, by their spouses, brothers and sisters.
[02:31:01.120 --> 02:31:02.861]  It's just ridiculous.
[02:31:02.901 --> 02:31:04.082]  Oh, like you raped your daughter?
[02:31:04.122 --> 02:31:04.722]  Nothing about it.
[02:31:05.083 --> 02:31:06.623]  And they try to arrest them when they cross the border.
[02:31:06.644 --> 02:31:07.364]  So now it's true?
[02:31:08.184 --> 02:31:09.185]  Yeah, that you raped your daughter?
[02:31:09.225 --> 02:31:14.288]  How many young women murdered by the same people he allows to come across our border?
[02:31:14.833 --> 02:31:17.834]  We have a border that's the most dangerous place anywhere in the world.
[02:31:17.874 --> 02:31:20.334]  Consider the most dangerous place anywhere in the world.
[02:31:20.834 --> 02:31:24.255]  And he opened it up and these killers are coming into our country.
[02:31:24.335 --> 02:31:26.416]  And they are raping and killing women.
[02:31:27.056 --> 02:31:28.176]  And it's a terrible thing.
[02:31:28.256 --> 02:31:31.017]  As far as the abortion is concerned, it is now back with the states.
[02:31:31.057 --> 02:31:32.757]  The states are voting.
[02:31:32.917 --> 02:31:36.178]  In many cases, it's frankly a very liberal decision.
[02:31:36.218 --> 02:31:37.698]  In many cases, it's the opposite.
[02:31:38.260 --> 02:31:45.664]  But they're voting, and it's bringing it back to the vote of the people, which is what everybody wanted, including the founders, if they knew about this issue.
[02:31:45.804 --> 02:31:45.984]  Bingo!
[02:31:46.004 --> 02:31:46.985]  Which, frankly, they didn't.
[02:31:47.585 --> 02:31:50.226]  But they would have—everybody wanted it brought back.
[02:31:50.347 --> 02:31:51.987]  Ronald Reagan wanted it brought back.
[02:31:52.027 --> 02:31:53.048]  He wasn't able to get it.
[02:31:53.588 --> 02:31:57.951]  Everybody wanted it brought back, and many presidents had tried to get it back.
[02:31:58.531 --> 02:31:59.511]  I was the one to do it.
[02:31:59.632 --> 02:32:03.374]  And again, this gives it the vote of the people, and that's where they wanted it.
[02:32:03.414 --> 02:32:03.994]  That was Trump's promise.
[02:32:04.014 --> 02:32:05.855]  Every legal scholar wanted it that way.
[02:32:06.826 --> 02:32:11.489]  Staying on the topic of abortion, President Biden, seven states... I'll let you do that.
[02:32:12.189 --> 02:32:13.330]  This is the same topic.
[02:32:13.490 --> 02:32:19.594]  Seven states have no legal restrictions on how far into a pregnancy... So they're gaming this by the questions.
[02:32:19.634 --> 02:32:20.775]  They're keeping it on abortion.
[02:32:20.895 --> 02:32:24.757]  Do you support any legal limits on how... See, the control is abortion.
[02:32:24.977 --> 02:32:25.998]  They're keeping it in that debate.
[02:32:30.569 --> 02:32:32.910]  Not World War III, not open borders.
[02:32:32.930 --> 02:32:35.310]  And what about the Justice Department?
[02:32:35.330 --> 02:32:36.751]  The censorship?
[02:32:36.771 --> 02:32:37.391]  Where's that?
[02:32:37.431 --> 02:32:38.351]  Where's that?
[02:32:38.391 --> 02:32:40.031]  Trump's just bringing it up.
[02:32:40.071 --> 02:32:41.192]  They're controlling it by the questions.
[02:32:41.272 --> 02:32:42.512]  Oh, like the Virginia governor said?
[02:32:42.331 --> 02:32:46.331]  Where's that? Where's that? Trump's just bringing it up.
[02:32:46.331 --> 02:32:49.331]  They're controlling it by the questions.
[02:32:49.331 --> 02:32:52.331]   That's the last. No politician should be making that decision.
[02:32:52.331 --> 02:32:55.331]   A doctor should be making those decisions. That's how it should be run.
[02:32:55.331 --> 02:32:59.331]   Oh, like the Virginia governor said. He killed nine-month-old babies. Keep them comfortable.
[02:32:59.331 --> 02:33:05.331]   So that means he can take the life of the baby in the ninth month and even after birth,
[02:33:05.331 --> 02:33:09.331]  because some states, Democrat run, take it after birth.
[02:33:09.527 --> 02:33:09.727]  New York.
[02:33:09.747 --> 02:33:14.228]  Again, the former governor of Virginia put the baby down, then we decide what to do with it.
[02:33:14.548 --> 02:33:20.569]  So he's willing to, as we say, rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month and kill the baby.
[02:33:21.249 --> 02:33:25.270]  Nobody wants that to happen, Democrat or Republican, nobody wants it to happen.
[02:33:26.631 --> 02:33:28.071]  That is simply not true.
[02:33:28.860 --> 02:33:31.004]  The Roe v. Wade does not provide for that.
[02:33:31.324 --> 02:33:32.486]  That's not the circumstance.
[02:33:32.907 --> 02:33:34.729]  By the way, CNN just broke their rule.
[02:33:34.770 --> 02:33:38.215]  They're supposed to have a minute, a minute, two minute, two minute.
[02:33:38.556 --> 02:33:41.140]  They just broke their rule right there for him.
[02:33:42.080 --> 02:33:44.542]  Roe v. Wade, you have late-term abolition.
[02:33:44.943 --> 02:33:47.024]  You can do whatever you want, depending on the state.
[02:33:47.064 --> 02:33:48.105]  You can do whatever you want.
[02:33:48.586 --> 02:33:49.847]  We don't think that's a good thing.
[02:33:49.907 --> 02:33:51.208]  We think it's a radical thing.
[02:33:51.508 --> 02:33:54.871]  We think the Democrats are the radicals, not the Republicans.
[02:33:55.111 --> 02:33:56.792]  51 years, that was the law.
[02:33:57.053 --> 02:33:59.435]  51 years, Constitutional Scholarship said it was the right way to go.
[02:33:59.455 --> 02:34:02.977]  Yeah, before that, we didn't kill babies.
[02:34:02.997 --> 02:34:05.039]  5,000 years ago, we sacrificed kids to Moloch.
[02:34:05.079 --> 02:34:05.720]  It's okay.
[02:34:05.780 --> 02:34:07.061]  Take credit for taking it away.
[02:34:07.461 --> 02:34:08.181]  What's he going to do?
[02:34:08.201 --> 02:34:09.682]  CNN doesn't know what to do.
[02:34:09.742 --> 02:34:10.883]  They've un-muted both mics.
[02:34:11.843 --> 02:34:13.284]  They've left their platform.
[02:34:13.684 --> 02:34:15.224]  They've left their rules right now.
[02:34:15.585 --> 02:34:18.866]  And they pass a universal ban on abortion, period.
[02:34:19.146 --> 02:34:19.886]  Across the board.
[02:34:19.966 --> 02:34:22.247]  CNN just abandoned their rules.
[02:34:22.507 --> 02:34:23.948]  Something very, very conservative.
[02:34:24.348 --> 02:34:25.369]  Is he going to sign that bill?
[02:34:25.729 --> 02:34:26.429]  I'll veto it.
[02:34:26.729 --> 02:34:27.430]  He'll sign it.
[02:34:27.910 --> 02:34:28.250]  Thank you.
[02:34:28.829 --> 02:34:30.931]  Let's turn now to the issue of immigration and border security.
[02:34:30.951 --> 02:34:31.151]  Boom!
[02:34:31.171 --> 02:34:32.713]  They just turned Trump's mic off.
[02:34:32.753 --> 02:34:34.775]  They just gave Biden more time.
[02:34:34.795 --> 02:34:35.276]  They just did it.
[02:34:36.897 --> 02:34:38.399]  Biden got a full minute extra right there.
[02:34:38.419 --> 02:34:40.401]  Because we worked very hard to get a bipartisan agreement.
[02:34:40.220 --> 02:34:44.059]   New York and Chicago and in some cases causing real safety and security concerns.
[02:34:44.059 --> 02:34:46.700]  Given that, why should voters trust you?
[02:34:46.700 --> 02:34:48.700]  I got a full minute extra right there.
[02:34:48.700 --> 02:34:51.220]  Because we worked very hard to get a bipartisan agreement.
[02:34:51.220 --> 02:34:52.220]  Not only...
[02:34:52.220 --> 02:34:53.819]  Oh, he always uses this.
[02:34:53.814 --> 02:34:55.274]  Oh, bipartisan, that's total amnesty.
[02:34:55.314 --> 02:34:55.514]  Wow.
[02:34:55.574 --> 02:34:58.255]  So, they just cheated Trump out of his response.
[02:34:58.295 --> 02:34:59.016]  Just caught him.
[02:34:59.056 --> 02:35:00.516]  At 821, they just cheated Trump.
[02:35:00.536 --> 02:35:01.437]  Right there they rigged it.
[02:35:01.477 --> 02:35:03.517]  They let him have a full minute extra.
[02:35:03.537 --> 02:35:04.138]  Boom, they just did it.
[02:35:03.977 --> 02:35:05.977]  his response, just caught him.
[02:35:05.977 --> 02:35:10.816]   By the way, the border patrolman endorsed- At 821, they just cheated Trump, right
[02:35:10.816 --> 02:35:11.816]  there they rigged it.
[02:35:11.816 --> 02:35:14.496]   Situation where- They let him have a full minute extra.
[02:35:14.496 --> 02:35:15.496]  Boom, they just did it.
[02:35:15.496 --> 02:35:16.496]  Now it's about to get worse.
[02:35:16.496 --> 02:35:21.496]  Cages, making sure the families are separated.
[02:35:21.496 --> 02:35:22.696]  That's not the right way to go.
[02:35:22.965 --> 02:35:31.510]  What I've done since I've changed the law, what's happened, I've changed it in a way that now you're in a situation where- And anything he does tonight, Bannon will call a cheap fake.
[02:35:31.550 --> 02:35:34.772]  People coming across the border illegally, it's better than when he left off.
[02:35:34.833 --> 02:35:36.974]  Guys, get the clip of him saying immediately, search the border.
[02:35:37.034 --> 02:35:38.115]  We get the total ban.
[02:35:38.515 --> 02:35:39.936]  I'm going to cut in this debate and play that.
[02:35:39.976 --> 02:35:41.497]  When you're ready.
[02:35:41.897 --> 02:35:46.560]  Relative to what we're going to do with more border patrol and more asylum officers.
[02:35:47.301 --> 02:35:47.761]  President Trump?
[02:35:48.401 --> 02:35:50.502]  I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence.
[02:35:50.522 --> 02:35:52.202]  I don't think he knows what he said either.
[02:35:52.282 --> 02:35:55.523]  Look, we have the safest border in the history of our country.
[02:35:56.584 --> 02:35:57.564]  All he had to do was leave it.
[02:35:57.744 --> 02:35:58.704]  All he had to do was leave it.
[02:35:59.304 --> 02:36:05.346]  He decided to open up our border, open up our country to people that are from prisons.
[02:36:06.109 --> 02:36:09.273]  People that are from mental institutions, insane asylum.
[02:36:09.734 --> 02:36:10.154]  Terrorists.
[02:36:10.254 --> 02:36:13.238]  We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now.
[02:36:13.439 --> 02:36:14.059]  All terrorists.
[02:36:14.340 --> 02:36:15.141]  All over the world.
[02:36:15.181 --> 02:36:16.442]  Not just in South America.
[02:36:16.563 --> 02:36:17.243]  All over the world.
[02:36:17.283 --> 02:36:18.605]  They come from the Middle East.
[02:36:18.765 --> 02:36:19.146]  Everywhere.
[02:36:19.326 --> 02:36:20.588]  All over the world they're pouring in.
[02:36:21.457 --> 02:36:23.338]  And this guy just left it open.
[02:36:23.638 --> 02:36:26.599]  And he didn't need legislation, because I didn't have legislation.
[02:36:26.639 --> 02:36:27.619]  I said, close the border.
[02:36:27.639 --> 02:36:29.280]  We had the safest border in history.
[02:36:29.640 --> 02:36:39.923]  In that final couple of months of my presidency, we had, according to Border Patrol, who is great, and by the way, who endorsed me for president, but I won't say that, but they endorsed me for president.
[02:36:40.686 --> 02:36:42.027]  Brandon, just speak to him.
[02:36:42.507 --> 02:36:45.148]  But, look, we had the safest border in history.
[02:36:45.408 --> 02:36:46.689]  Now we have the worst border in history.
[02:36:46.869 --> 02:36:48.249]  There's never been anything like it.
[02:36:48.529 --> 02:36:52.691]  And people are dying all over the place, including the people that are coming up in caravans.
[02:36:52.731 --> 02:36:53.471]  Thank you, President Trump.
[02:36:53.491 --> 02:36:54.092]  President Biden?
[02:36:54.112 --> 02:36:57.073]  The only terrorist who's done anything across the board.
[02:36:58.044 --> 02:37:01.885]  In fact, make sure that there is- we immediately surge to the border.
[02:37:02.185 --> 02:37:03.626]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[02:37:03.846 --> 02:37:04.706]  They deserve to be heard.
[02:37:04.726 --> 02:37:05.466]  That's who we are.
[02:37:05.746 --> 02:37:09.127]  We're a nation that says if you want to flee and you're fleeing oppression, you should come.
[02:37:09.147 --> 02:37:11.108]  In fact, make sure- Terrorists is there.
[02:37:11.488 --> 02:37:13.969]  I'm not saying no terrorist ever got through with the idea.
[02:37:14.329 --> 02:37:15.349]  They're emptying their prisons.
[02:37:15.389 --> 02:37:16.789]  We're welcoming these people.
[02:37:17.089 --> 02:37:18.130]  That's simply not true.
[02:37:18.150 --> 02:37:20.250]  There's no data to support what he said.
[02:37:20.630 --> 02:37:21.911]  Once again, he's exaggerating.
[02:37:21.971 --> 02:37:22.531]  He's lying.
[02:37:23.632 --> 02:37:31.717]  President Trump, staying on the topic of immigration, you said that you have, quote, the largest domestic deportation operation in American history, unquote.
[02:37:32.058 --> 02:37:42.164]  Does that mean that you will deport every undocumented immigrant in America, including those who have jobs, including those whose spouses are citizens, and including those who have lived here for decades?
[02:37:42.285 --> 02:37:44.186]  And if so, how will you do it?
[02:37:44.766 --> 02:37:45.427]  Just one second.
[02:37:45.447 --> 02:37:46.808]  He said we killed three people.
[02:37:47.608 --> 02:37:58.513]   The people we killed are al-Baghdadi, And Salamani, the two greatest terrorists, biggest terrorists anywhere in the world, that had a huge impact on everything, not just border, on everything.
[02:37:59.293 --> 02:38:07.795]  He's the one that killed people with the bad water, including hundreds of thousands of people dying, and also killing our citizens when they come in.
[02:38:08.695 --> 02:38:11.096]  We are living right now in a rat's nest.
[02:38:11.396 --> 02:38:17.978]  They're killing our people in New York, in California, in every state in the Union, because we don't have borders anymore.
[02:38:18.098 --> 02:38:19.538]  Every state is now a border.
[02:38:20.078 --> 02:38:29.182]  And because of his ridiculous, insane and very stupid policies, people are coming in and they're killing our citizens at a level that we've never seen.
[02:38:29.222 --> 02:38:30.663]  We call it migrant crime.
[02:38:31.143 --> 02:38:33.104]  I call it Biden migrant crime.
[02:38:33.444 --> 02:38:36.626]  They're killing our citizens at a level that we've never seen before.
[02:38:36.926 --> 02:38:41.168]  And you're reading it like these three incredible young girls over the last few days.
[02:38:42.125 --> 02:38:47.652]  One of them, I just spoke to the mother, and he just said the funeral for this girl, 12 years old.
[02:38:48.052 --> 02:38:51.797]  This is horrible what's taken place, what's taken place in our country.
[02:38:52.398 --> 02:38:55.444]   We're literally An uncivilized country now.
[02:38:55.925 --> 02:38:57.726]  He doesn't want it to be, he just doesn't know.
[02:38:58.027 --> 02:39:00.889]  He opened the borders, nobody's ever seen anything like.
[02:39:01.250 --> 02:39:04.232]  And we have to get a lot of these people out, and we have to get them out fast.
[02:39:04.552 --> 02:39:06.174]  Because they're going to destroy our country.
[02:39:06.434 --> 02:39:07.755]  Just take a look at where they're living.
[02:39:08.156 --> 02:39:12.239]  They're living in luxury hotels in New York City and other places.
[02:39:12.880 --> 02:39:16.343]  Our veterans are on the street, they're dying because he doesn't care about our veterans.
[02:39:16.383 --> 02:39:18.485]  He doesn't care, he doesn't like the military at all.
[02:39:19.085 --> 02:39:20.426]  And he doesn't care about our veterans.
[02:39:20.486 --> 02:39:21.327]  Nobody been worse.
[02:39:21.788 --> 02:39:25.291]  I had the highest approval rating for veterans taking care of the VA.
[02:39:25.831 --> 02:39:26.452]  He has the worst.
[02:39:26.492 --> 02:39:28.514]  He's gotten rid of all the things that I approved.
[02:39:28.614 --> 02:39:33.899]  Choice, that I got through Congress, all of the different things I approved, they abandoned.
[02:39:34.319 --> 02:39:43.528]  We had by far the highest and now it's down in less than half because he's done all these great things that we did and I think he did it just because I approved it, which is crazy.
[02:39:44.028 --> 02:39:48.230]  But he has killed so many people at our border by allowing all of these people to come in.
[02:39:48.611 --> 02:39:50.271]  And it's a very sad day in America.
[02:39:50.291 --> 02:39:51.252]  President Biden, you have the mic.
[02:39:51.432 --> 02:39:52.973]  Every single thing he said is a lie.
[02:39:53.593 --> 02:39:54.354]  Every single one.
[02:39:54.694 --> 02:39:58.616]  For example, veterans are a hell of a lot better off since I passed the PAC Act.
[02:39:59.336 --> 02:40:02.378]  One million of them now have insurance and their families have it.
[02:40:02.970 --> 02:40:08.954]  Their families have it because what happened, whether it was Agent Orange or burn pits, they're all being covered now.
[02:40:09.494 --> 02:40:11.635]  And he opposed, his group opposed that.
[02:40:12.036 --> 02:40:15.498]  We're also in a situation where we have great respect for veterans.
[02:40:15.518 --> 02:40:16.858]  My son spent a year in Iraq.
[02:40:17.479 --> 02:40:21.381]  Later went on to the next one of those burn pits, came back with stage four glioblastoma.
[02:40:21.882 --> 02:40:25.804]  I was recently in France for D-Day.
[02:40:26.431 --> 02:40:28.994]  And I spoke all about those heroes that died.
[02:40:29.435 --> 02:40:33.580]  I went to the World War II cemetery, World War I cemetery he refused to go to.
[02:40:34.040 --> 02:40:39.567]  He was standing with his four-star general and he told me, he said, I don't want to go in there because they're a bunch of losers and suckers.
[02:40:40.048 --> 02:40:41.229]  My son was not a loser.
[02:40:41.249 --> 02:40:42.050]  He was not a sucker.
[02:40:42.331 --> 02:40:43.031]  You're the sucker.
[02:40:43.192 --> 02:40:43.752]  You're the loser.
[02:40:43.832 --> 02:40:44.513]  Another lie.
[02:40:44.533 --> 02:40:44.974]  President Trump?
[02:40:46.211 --> 02:40:47.552]  First of all, that was a made-up quote.
[02:40:47.592 --> 02:40:48.553]  Suckers and losers.
[02:40:48.593 --> 02:40:49.233]  They made it up.
[02:40:49.333 --> 02:40:52.895]  It was in a third-rate magazine that's failing like many of these magazines.
[02:40:53.496 --> 02:40:54.156]  He made that up.
[02:40:54.556 --> 02:40:55.697]  He put it in commercials.
[02:40:55.797 --> 02:40:56.718]  We've notified him.
[02:40:57.078 --> 02:40:59.219]  We had 19 people that said I didn't say it.
[02:40:59.299 --> 02:40:59.839]  And think of this.
[02:41:00.240 --> 02:41:03.922]  Who would say I'm at a cemetery or I'm talking about our veterans?
[02:41:04.162 --> 02:41:05.803]  Because nobody's taken better care.
[02:41:05.823 --> 02:41:08.165]  I'm so glad this came up and he brought it up.
[02:41:09.125 --> 02:41:12.107]  There's nobody that's taken better care of our soldiers than I have.
[02:41:12.751 --> 02:41:17.173]  To think that I would, in front of generals and others, say, suckers and losers.
[02:41:17.193 --> 02:41:21.095]  We have 19 people that said, it was never said by me.
[02:41:21.615 --> 02:41:22.676]  It was made up by him.
[02:41:22.756 --> 02:41:24.797]  Just like Russia, Russia, Russia was made up.
[02:41:25.137 --> 02:41:28.038]  Just like the 51 intelligence agents are made up.
[02:41:28.058 --> 02:41:28.598]  Trump's dominating.
[02:41:29.018 --> 02:41:32.000]  Just like the new thing with the 16 economists are talking.
[02:41:32.020 --> 02:41:32.900]  It's the same thing.
[02:41:33.661 --> 02:41:38.243]  51 intelligence agents said that the laptop was Russia disinformation.
[02:41:38.383 --> 02:41:38.863]  It wasn't.
[02:41:38.883 --> 02:41:40.744]  That came from his son, Hunter.
[02:41:41.364 --> 02:41:43.025]  It wasn't Russia disinformation.
[02:41:43.265 --> 02:41:47.386]  He made up the suckers and losers, so he should apologize to me right now.
[02:41:48.147 --> 02:41:50.928]  Four-star General Stand Your Side was on your staff.
[02:41:50.948 --> 02:41:52.028]  He said you said it.
[02:41:52.468 --> 02:41:52.848]  Period.
[02:41:53.229 --> 02:41:53.969]  That's number one.
[02:41:54.529 --> 02:42:00.051]  And number two, the idea that I have to apologize to you for anything along the line.
[02:42:00.451 --> 02:42:02.532]  We've done more... Apologize for raping your daughter.
[02:42:02.572 --> 02:42:03.232]  American history.
[02:42:03.833 --> 02:42:04.513]  American history.
[02:42:04.969 --> 02:42:06.390]  And they now are in their family.
[02:42:06.670 --> 02:42:13.516]  The only sacred obligation we have as a country is to care for our veterans when they come home and their families and equip them when they go to war.
[02:42:14.017 --> 02:42:14.937]  That's what we're doing.
[02:42:15.258 --> 02:42:16.679]  That's what the VA is doing now.
[02:42:17.039 --> 02:42:19.701]  They're doing more for veterans than ever before in our history.
[02:42:20.182 --> 02:42:20.422]  All right.
[02:42:20.482 --> 02:42:21.063]  Thank you so much.
[02:42:21.083 --> 02:42:23.304]  Let's move to the topic of foreign policy.
[02:42:23.324 --> 02:42:28.509]  I want to begin with Russia's war against Ukraine, which is now in its third year.
[02:42:29.406 --> 02:42:38.991]  Former President Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin says he'll only end this war if Russia keeps the Ukrainian territory it has already claimed.
[02:42:39.631 --> 02:42:42.713]  Notice how the questions spin everything.
[02:42:42.873 --> 02:42:45.795]  Are Putin's terms acceptable to you?
[02:42:46.195 --> 02:42:50.757]  First of all, our veterans and our soldiers can't stand this guy.
[02:42:51.318 --> 02:42:52.338]  They can't stand him.
[02:42:52.598 --> 02:42:55.540]  They think he's the worst commander in chief, if that's what you call him.
[02:42:57.250 --> 02:42:58.091]  They can't stand him.
[02:42:58.351 --> 02:42:59.372]  So let's get that straight.
[02:43:00.012 --> 02:43:02.094]  And they like me more than just about any of them.
[02:43:02.835 --> 02:43:05.517]  And that's based on every single bit of information.
[02:43:05.997 --> 02:43:15.806]  As far as Russia and Ukraine, if we had a real president, the president that knew, that was respected by Putin, he would have never, he would have never invaded Ukraine.
[02:43:16.446 --> 02:43:19.329]  A lot of people are dead right now, much more than people know.
[02:43:19.349 --> 02:43:20.550]  You know, they talk about numbers.
[02:43:20.590 --> 02:43:22.852]  You can double those numbers, maybe triple those numbers.
[02:43:23.760 --> 02:43:24.921]  He did nothing to stop it.
[02:43:24.961 --> 02:43:27.222]  In fact, I think he encouraged Russia from going in.
[02:43:27.723 --> 02:43:28.483]  I'll tell you what happened.
[02:43:28.523 --> 02:43:42.232]  He was so bad with Afghanistan, it was such a horrible embarrassment, most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, that when Putin watched that, and he saw the incompetence, that he should have fired those generals like I fired the one that you mentioned.
[02:43:42.632 --> 02:43:43.994]  And so he's got no love lost.
[02:43:44.354 --> 02:43:45.756]  But he should have fired those generals.
[02:43:45.916 --> 02:43:55.147]  No general got fired for the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, Afghanistan, where we left billions of dollars of equipment behind.
[02:43:55.427 --> 02:43:59.812]  We lost 13 beautiful soldiers and 38 soldiers were obliterated.
[02:43:59.912 --> 02:44:01.634]  And by the way, we left people behind too.
[02:44:01.654 --> 02:44:03.296]  We left American citizens behind.
[02:44:03.716 --> 02:44:06.157]  When Putin saw that, he said, you know what?
[02:44:06.477 --> 02:44:10.199]  I think we're going to go in and maybe take my... This was his dream.
[02:44:10.359 --> 02:44:11.400]  I talked to him about it.
[02:44:11.440 --> 02:44:11.840]  His dream.
[02:44:12.140 --> 02:44:15.761]  The difference is he never would have invaded Ukraine.
[02:44:15.921 --> 02:44:16.282]  Never.
[02:44:16.962 --> 02:44:22.464]  Just like Israel would have never been invaded in a million years by Hamas.
[02:44:23.125 --> 02:44:23.545]  You know why?
[02:44:24.201 --> 02:44:26.083]  Because Iran was broke with me.
[02:44:26.303 --> 02:44:28.124]  I wouldn't let anybody do business with them.
[02:44:28.184 --> 02:44:29.165]  They ran out of money.
[02:44:29.205 --> 02:44:29.746]  They were broke.
[02:44:29.786 --> 02:44:31.027]  They had no money for Hamas.
[02:44:31.307 --> 02:44:32.728]  They had no money for anything.
[02:44:33.028 --> 02:44:33.809]  No money for terror.
[02:44:34.029 --> 02:44:37.632]  That's why you had no terror at all during my administration.
[02:44:38.113 --> 02:44:40.515]  This place, the whole world is blowing up under him.
[02:44:42.136 --> 02:44:42.576]  President Biden?
[02:44:42.596 --> 02:44:45.559]  I've never heard so much malarkey in my whole life.
[02:44:45.619 --> 02:44:58.227]   Look, the fact of the matter is that we're in a situation where, let's take the last point first, Iran attacked American troops, caused brain damage for a number of these troops, and he did nothing about it.
[02:44:58.788 --> 02:44:59.608]  Not when he was president.
[02:44:59.628 --> 02:45:00.889]  They attacked.
[02:45:01.250 --> 02:45:02.811]  He said they're just having headaches.
[02:45:02.871 --> 02:45:03.612]  That's all it is.
[02:45:04.212 --> 02:45:07.095]  He didn't do a thing when the attack took place, number one.
[02:45:07.615 --> 02:45:15.505]   Number two, We got over 100,000 Americans and others out of Afghanistan during that airlift.
[02:45:15.945 --> 02:45:28.014]  Number three, we found ourselves in a situation where if you take a look at what Trump did in Ukraine, this guy told Ukraine, told Trump, do whatever you want and do whatever you want.
[02:45:28.615 --> 02:45:30.136]  And that's exactly what Trump did.
[02:45:30.877 --> 02:45:33.677]  to Putin, encourage him, do whatever you want.
[02:45:33.677 --> 02:45:36.157]  And he went in, listen to what he said when he went in.
[02:45:36.157 --> 02:45:38.477]  It was gonna take Kiev in five days, you remember?
[02:45:38.477 --> 02:45:40.437]  Because it's part of the old Soviet Union.
[02:45:40.437 --> 02:45:43.277]  That's what he wanted to reestablish, Kiev.
[02:45:43.277 --> 02:45:45.037]  And he in fact didn't do it at all.
[02:45:45.037 --> 02:45:46.957]  He didn't, wasn't able to get it done.
[02:45:46.957 --> 02:45:50.716]   And they've lost over, they've lost thousands and thousands of troops,
[02:45:50.716 --> 02:45:52.837]  500,000 troops. - Thank you.
[02:45:52.837 --> 02:45:53.657]  President Trump, I'm gonna come back to you--
[02:45:53.657 --> 02:45:57.477]   I never said that. - For one minute, I just wanna go back to my original question,
[02:45:57.477 --> 02:46:01.117]  which is, are Putin's terms acceptable to you?
[02:46:01.043 --> 02:46:02.644]  Keeping the territory in Ukraine?
[02:46:02.824 --> 02:46:03.945]  No, they're not acceptable.
[02:46:04.865 --> 02:46:07.367]  But look, this is a war that never should have started.
[02:46:07.627 --> 02:46:10.709]  If we had a leader in this war, he led everybody along.
[02:46:11.229 --> 02:46:15.331]  He's given $200 billion now or more to Ukraine.
[02:46:15.351 --> 02:46:16.712]  He's given $200 billion.
[02:46:17.092 --> 02:46:18.173]  That's a lot of money.
[02:46:18.233 --> 02:46:19.974]  I don't think there's ever been anything like it.
[02:46:20.054 --> 02:46:24.072]   Every time that Zelensky comes to this country, he walks away with $60 billion.
[02:46:24.432 --> 02:46:25.753]  He's the greatest salesman ever.
[02:46:26.193 --> 02:46:28.394]  And I'm not knocking him, I'm not knocking anything.
[02:46:28.734 --> 02:46:36.237]  I'm only saying, the money that we're spending on this war, and we shouldn't be spending, it should have never happened.
[02:46:36.657 --> 02:46:40.219]  I will have that war settled between Putin and Zelensky.
[02:46:40.239 --> 02:46:41.119]  This will cut the money off.
[02:46:41.159 --> 02:46:45.381]  As President-elect, before I take office on January 20th, I'll have that war settled.
[02:46:45.581 --> 02:46:55.670]   Alright, if Trump is completely dominating, despite CNN giving extra down to Biden, Total domination, go back to it.
[02:46:57.373 --> 02:46:59.517]  The fact is that Putin is a war criminal.
[02:47:00.078 --> 02:47:02.744]  He's killed thousands and thousands of people.
[02:47:03.499 --> 02:47:05.159]  And he has made one thing clear.
[02:47:05.660 --> 02:47:09.001]  He wants to re-establish what was part of the Soviet Empire.
[02:47:09.401 --> 02:47:10.181]  Not just a piece.
[02:47:10.201 --> 02:47:11.441]  He wants all of Ukraine.
[02:47:11.821 --> 02:47:12.541]  That's what he wants.
[02:47:12.842 --> 02:47:14.142]  And then you think he'll stop there?
[02:47:14.502 --> 02:47:17.863]  Do you think he'll stop if he takes Ukraine?
[02:47:18.243 --> 02:47:19.423]  What do you think happens to Poland?
[02:47:19.443 --> 02:47:22.584]  What do you think happens to those NATO countries?
[02:47:22.604 --> 02:47:25.525]  That's like saying we gotta attack the Middle East and the Muslims will come here.
[02:47:26.085 --> 02:47:27.486]  And then they bring all the Muslims here.
[02:47:28.406 --> 02:47:32.448]  I mean, no, the West admits they overthrew the Ukrainian government ten years ago.
[02:47:32.828 --> 02:47:33.848]  They started the war.
[02:47:34.248 --> 02:47:38.710]  They did it all to lure Russia into World War III, which I told Russia they shouldn't do.
[02:47:38.730 --> 02:47:40.191]  But now it's on.
[02:47:40.631 --> 02:47:43.732]  And the dollars die because of this guy's bad management.
[02:47:44.052 --> 02:47:45.013]  That's why we're strong.
[02:47:46.906 --> 02:47:48.327]  We're moving on to the Middle East.
[02:47:48.948 --> 02:47:55.534]  In October, Hamas attacked Israel, killing more than 1,000 people.
[02:47:55.995 --> 02:47:59.719]  Among those held and thought to still be alive are five Americans.
[02:48:00.519 --> 02:48:05.704]  Israel's response has killed thousands of Palestinians and created a humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
[02:48:06.385 --> 02:48:19.536]   President Biden You've put forward a proposal to resolve this conflict, but so far Hamas has not released the remaining hostages and Israel is continuing its military offensive in Gaza.
[02:48:20.076 --> 02:48:25.862]  So what additional leverage will you use to get Hamas and Israel to end the war?
[02:48:25.942 --> 02:48:26.663]  You have two minutes.
[02:48:28.624 --> 02:48:37.949]  Everyone from the United Nations Security Council straight through to the G7, the Israelis and Netanyahu himself have endorsed the plan I put forward.
[02:48:38.490 --> 02:48:44.753]  Endorsed the plan I put forward, which has three stages to it.
[02:48:45.054 --> 02:48:49.836]  The first stage is ceasefire with additional conditions.
[02:48:50.237 --> 02:48:52.938]  The third phase is no, the end of the war.
[02:48:53.398 --> 02:48:56.600]  The only one who wants the war to continue is Hamas, number one.
[02:48:56.740 --> 02:48:57.781]  They're the only ones standing out.
[02:48:58.188 --> 02:49:01.431]  We're still pushing hard to get them to accept.
[02:49:01.511 --> 02:49:05.534]  No, Netanyahu wants us to continue to stay in power and moralize.
[02:49:05.555 --> 02:49:07.396]  I'm not for the Muslims.
[02:49:07.416 --> 02:49:08.897]  Get that straight.
[02:49:09.278 --> 02:49:11.300]  They don't work very well in populated areas.
[02:49:11.340 --> 02:49:12.561]  They kill a lot of innocent people.
[02:49:13.041 --> 02:49:15.864]  We're providing Israel with all the weapons they need and when they need them.
[02:49:16.304 --> 02:49:16.985]  That's another lie.
[02:49:17.005 --> 02:49:18.186]  They block Israel getting the weapons.
[02:49:19.111 --> 02:49:21.855]  By the way, I'm not even for him giving the weapons, but everything he says is a lie!
[02:49:23.237 --> 02:49:25.580]  God Almighty!
[02:49:25.821 --> 02:49:34.293]  By the way, Harrison, Owen, Chase, you guys are willing to do a little quick pop-ins if you want to say anything, but right now Biden's getting his ass kicked.
[02:49:34.333 --> 02:49:35.815]  I mean, Trump is leveling his ass.
[02:49:37.737 --> 02:49:38.317]  Owen, you agree?
[02:49:38.457 --> 02:49:40.058]  Turn Owen up.
[02:49:40.418 --> 02:49:43.579]  This is undeniably an absolute slaughter.
[02:49:44.220 --> 02:49:47.901]  And look, I actually gotta give CNN credit.
[02:49:47.941 --> 02:49:50.782]  They're conducting a pretty square debate so far, I would say.
[02:49:50.822 --> 02:49:53.763]  Well, they're cheating a little for Biden, but you're right, because they know the rules.
[02:49:53.863 --> 02:49:54.404]  I agree.
[02:49:55.264 --> 02:50:01.046]  I mean, but look, Biden, right out of the gate, lost his voice, and he's quickly deteriorating with 60 minutes left.
[02:50:03.727 --> 02:50:04.527]  I agree.
[02:50:04.888 --> 02:50:05.668]  Chase, you wanna say something?
[02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:07.581]  Yeah, well... Back to Trump!
[02:50:07.601 --> 02:50:08.181]  Back to Trump!
[02:50:08.201 --> 02:50:08.841]  Back to you, go ahead.
[02:50:09.201 --> 02:50:09.461]  Sure.
[02:50:12.302 --> 02:50:16.184]  I've spent a hundred billion, or maybe more than that, less than us.
[02:50:17.245 --> 02:50:20.606]  Why doesn't he call them and say, you gotta put up your money like I did with NATO?
[02:50:20.666 --> 02:50:23.127]  I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars.
[02:50:23.147 --> 02:50:27.229]  The Secretary General of NATO said Trump did the most incredible job I've ever seen.
[02:50:27.669 --> 02:50:29.770]  You wouldn't, they wouldn't have any, they were going out of business.
[02:50:29.790 --> 02:50:33.611]  We were spending almost a hundred percent of the money was paid by us.
[02:50:34.732 --> 02:50:35.392]  He didn't do that.
[02:50:36.030 --> 02:50:38.952]  He's getting all... You gotta ask these people to put up the money.
[02:50:39.232 --> 02:50:46.536]  We're over a hundred billion dollars more spent and it has a bigger impact on them because of location, because we have an ocean in between.
[02:50:46.917 --> 02:50:47.657]  You gotta ask them.
[02:50:47.717 --> 02:50:53.100]  As far as Israel and Hamas, Israel's the one that wants to go.
[02:50:53.140 --> 02:50:55.422]  He said the only one who wants to keep going is Hamas.
[02:50:55.782 --> 02:50:57.003]  Actually, Israel is the one.
[02:50:57.243 --> 02:50:59.364]  And you should let him go and let him finish the job.
[02:50:59.624 --> 02:51:00.365]  He doesn't want to do it.
[02:51:00.385 --> 02:51:01.906]  He's become like a Palestinian.
[02:51:02.466 --> 02:51:04.947]  But they don't like him because he's a very bad Palestinian.
[02:51:05.008 --> 02:51:05.668]  He's a weak one.
[02:51:07.062 --> 02:51:08.242]  President Biden, do you have a minute?
[02:51:08.623 --> 02:51:10.043]  I've never heard so much foolishness.
[02:51:10.603 --> 02:51:12.124]  This is all he wants to get out of NATO.
[02:51:12.144 --> 02:51:13.204]  You're going to stay in NATO?
[02:51:13.825 --> 02:51:14.905]  He's going to pull out of NATO.
[02:51:15.425 --> 02:51:17.426]  He made Donald Pony up.
[02:51:17.526 --> 02:51:19.767]  Trump is transactional.
[02:51:19.807 --> 02:51:20.527]  Fade down Biden.
[02:51:20.767 --> 02:51:22.648]  Let's go to Chase Geyser and Harrison Smith.
[02:51:22.668 --> 02:51:23.228]  You want to comment?
[02:51:23.248 --> 02:51:24.349]  We don't need to hear.
[02:51:24.429 --> 02:51:25.929]  People that want Biden, you can tune into that.
[02:51:25.970 --> 02:51:26.750]  We're giving commentary.
[02:51:27.617 --> 02:51:28.518]  Go ahead, Chase.
[02:51:28.558 --> 02:51:29.158]  Sure, sure.
[02:51:29.198 --> 02:51:32.161]  Well, the thing I noticed was right out of the gate, he didn't even have his voice.
[02:51:32.181 --> 02:51:34.023]  It's not even that he lost his voice during the debate.
[02:51:34.063 --> 02:51:41.249]  He didn't have it to begin with, which shows that he has been speaking and practicing this week, speaking more than he normally speaks, right?
[02:51:41.289 --> 02:51:47.094]  And you'd think the President of the United States would speak all day, every day in meetings, phone calls with international leaders.
[02:51:47.454 --> 02:51:51.038]  This proves to me that Biden is doing very little speaking.
[02:51:51.338 --> 02:51:51.738]  That's right.
[02:51:52.259 --> 02:51:53.620]  Real quick, Harrison Smith.
[02:51:54.902 --> 02:52:00.066]  Well, what I've noticed so far is that they've given basically every last word has gone to Biden.
[02:52:00.086 --> 02:52:03.328]  Biden's gotten a chance to close out the conversation on every single topic so far.
[02:52:03.368 --> 02:52:06.771]  So they are still rigging it quite blatantly in front of everybody.
[02:52:06.791 --> 02:52:10.193]  I want to listen to Biden, though, because I'm afraid we're going to miss a big blunder here.
[02:52:10.213 --> 02:52:11.274]  We don't want to miss that, do we?
[02:52:11.354 --> 02:52:11.834]  No, you're right.
[02:52:11.954 --> 02:52:12.274]  Go back.
[02:52:13.415 --> 02:52:15.957]  The problem we have is that we spend all the money.
[02:52:16.517 --> 02:52:17.618]  So they kill us on trade.
[02:52:17.658 --> 02:52:24.223]  I made great trade deals with the European nations because if you add them up, they're about the same size economically.
[02:52:24.804 --> 02:52:27.505]  Their economy is about the same size as the United States.
[02:52:27.946 --> 02:52:31.228]  And they were written, no cars, no, they don't want anything that we have.
[02:52:31.328 --> 02:52:35.110]  But we're supposed to take their cars, their food, their everything, their agriculture.
[02:52:35.150 --> 02:52:35.610]  Exactly.
[02:52:35.890 --> 02:52:36.611]  I changed that.
[02:52:36.731 --> 02:52:37.611]  This is why they hate Trump.
[02:52:37.631 --> 02:52:38.351]  The big thing I changed.
[02:52:38.371 --> 02:52:40.713]  Because the globals are middlemen selling it to us.
[02:52:41.293 --> 02:52:42.654]  This is why they hate Trump.
[02:52:43.194 --> 02:52:44.315]  He's at least going to give us the money.
[02:52:44.335 --> 02:52:48.517]  We got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars, I said, and he's right about this.
[02:52:48.857 --> 02:52:51.819]  I said, no, I'm not going to support NATO if you don't pay.
[02:52:52.478 --> 02:53:01.108]  They asked me that question, would you guard us against Russia at a very secret meeting of the 28 states at that time, nations at that time.
[02:53:01.428 --> 02:53:03.951]  And I said, no, if you don't pay, I won't do that.
[02:53:04.031 --> 02:53:04.792]  And you know what happened?
[02:53:05.412 --> 02:53:09.477]  Billions and billions of dollars came flowing in the next day and the next months.
[02:53:10.478 --> 02:53:11.940]  But now we're in the same position.
[02:53:11.980 --> 02:53:12.460]  Exactly.
[02:53:12.500 --> 02:53:13.802]  We're paying everybody's bills.
[02:53:14.389 --> 02:53:16.010]  Let's turn to the issue of democracy.
[02:53:16.050 --> 02:53:18.172]  Let me just say, you're right.
[02:53:18.592 --> 02:53:25.358]  I get Owen, it's not as bad as we thought it would be, but I think Trump is getting like, I think Biden's got 20% more time here.
[02:53:26.118 --> 02:53:28.100]  Maybe, but that's not helping him.
[02:53:28.240 --> 02:53:30.161]  I mean, unintentionally, it's hurting him.
[02:53:30.342 --> 02:53:31.743]  No, I agree with you, Owen.
[02:53:31.783 --> 02:53:32.864]  They're definitely shaving here.
[02:53:32.884 --> 02:53:33.264]  Let's go back.
[02:53:34.321 --> 02:53:41.024]  What do you say to voters who believe that you violated that oath through your actions and inaction on January 6th, and worry that you'll do it again?
[02:53:41.044 --> 02:53:44.365]  Well, I don't think too many believe that, and let me tell you about January 6th.
[02:53:45.145 --> 02:53:47.726]  On January 6th, we had a great border.
[02:53:48.367 --> 02:53:49.187]  Nobody coming through.
[02:53:49.207 --> 02:53:50.408]  See, now it's all anti-Trump crap.
[02:53:50.428 --> 02:53:52.508]  On January 6th, we were energy independent.
[02:53:52.528 --> 02:53:54.449]  Oh God, five cops got beat up.
[02:53:54.509 --> 02:53:55.590]  Five citizens got killed.
[02:53:55.730 --> 02:53:57.050]  How about January 6th?
[02:53:57.270 --> 02:53:58.531]  This is where the rigging comes in.
[02:53:58.571 --> 02:53:59.271]  Get ready, folks.
[02:53:59.411 --> 02:54:01.452]  Now the real rigging's about to happen.
[02:54:01.532 --> 02:54:02.512]  These are the questions.
[02:54:04.281 --> 02:54:05.382]  And we're now left at.
[02:54:05.482 --> 02:54:07.283]  We're like a bunch of stupid people.
[02:54:07.963 --> 02:54:14.207]  That what happened to the United States' reputation under this man's leadership is horrible.
[02:54:14.227 --> 02:54:15.548]  I love how Trump ignored the question.
[02:54:15.588 --> 02:54:15.968]  That's good.
[02:54:15.988 --> 02:54:17.930]  Which I'm sure at some point you'll be talking about.
[02:54:18.370 --> 02:54:21.572]  Where he goes after his political opponent because he can't beat him fair and square.
[02:54:22.518 --> 02:54:23.879]  You have 80 seconds left.
[02:54:23.999 --> 02:54:34.067]  My question was, what do you say to those voters who believe that you violated your constitutional oath through your actions in an action on January 6th, 2001, and worry that you'll do it again?
[02:54:34.207 --> 02:54:35.968]  Well, I didn't say that to anybody.
[02:54:35.988 --> 02:54:38.770]  I said, peacefully and patriotically.
[02:54:38.950 --> 02:54:52.106]   And Nancy Pelosi, if you just watched the news from two days ago, on tape to her daughter, who's a documentary filmmaker, they say, But she's saying, oh no, it's my responsibility, I was responsible for this.
[02:54:52.586 --> 02:54:56.930]  Because I offered her 10,000 soldiers or National Guard, and she turned them down.
[02:54:56.990 --> 02:55:02.495]  And the mayor of, in writing by the way, the mayor, in writing turned it down, the mayor of DC.
[02:55:03.502 --> 02:55:04.283]  They turned it down.
[02:55:04.603 --> 02:55:06.884]  I offered 10,000 because I could see.
[02:55:06.904 --> 02:55:09.225]  I had virtually nothing to do.
[02:55:09.265 --> 02:55:10.506]  They asked me to go make a speech.
[02:55:11.126 --> 02:55:12.127]  I could see what was happening.
[02:55:12.167 --> 02:55:14.308]  Everybody was saying they're going to be there on January 6th.
[02:55:14.348 --> 02:55:14.989]  They're going to be there.
[02:55:15.409 --> 02:55:16.310]  And I said, you know what?
[02:55:16.410 --> 02:55:17.570]  There's a lot of people coming.
[02:55:17.610 --> 02:55:18.311]  You could feel it.
[02:55:18.451 --> 02:55:19.311]  You could feel it too.
[02:55:19.431 --> 02:55:20.272]  And you could feel it.
[02:55:20.772 --> 02:55:23.994]  And I said, they ought to have some National Guard or whatever.
[02:55:24.014 --> 02:55:24.914]  Totally honest response.
[02:55:24.934 --> 02:55:28.536]  And I offered it to her, and she now admits that she turned it down.
[02:55:28.957 --> 02:55:34.500]  And it was the same day she was, I don't know, she can't be very happy with her daughter because it made her into a liar.
[02:55:34.900 --> 02:55:38.442]  She said, I take full responsibility for January 6th.
[02:55:39.603 --> 02:55:40.123]  President Biden?
[02:55:41.484 --> 02:55:45.366]  Look, he encouraged those folks to go up on Capitol Hill, number one.
[02:55:46.138 --> 02:55:47.159]  I sat in the dining room.
[02:55:47.179 --> 02:55:48.481]  He was going to give a speech there.
[02:55:48.841 --> 02:55:49.262]  Liar!
[02:55:49.743 --> 02:55:50.243]  I was there.
[02:55:50.343 --> 02:56:00.215]  Three hours watching, begging, being begged by his Vice President and a number of his colleagues on the Republican side as well to do something, to call for a stop, to end it.
[02:56:00.596 --> 02:56:02.278]  Instead he talked about this.
[02:56:02.318 --> 02:56:04.040]  No, Trump immediately said be peaceful.
[02:56:04.140 --> 02:56:05.462]  He said it during his speech.
[02:56:05.862 --> 02:56:09.683]  Well let me just say Donald Trump's response to that rigged setup question was just about perfect.
[02:56:09.502 --> 02:56:12.022]  Oh, and come in here and respond to this.
[02:56:12.022 --> 02:56:13.421]  I want to hear his crap.
[02:56:13.421 --> 02:56:16.102]  You were put in jail for months for peacefully with me.
[02:56:16.102 --> 02:56:19.702]   The Fed said you didn't work here, told a judge put you in jail longer for lying about
[02:56:19.702 --> 02:56:20.702]  it.
[02:56:20.702 --> 02:56:21.702]  You've been here seven years.
[02:56:21.702 --> 02:56:22.702]  What do you say to this crap?
[02:56:22.702 --> 02:56:28.662]   Well, let me just say Donald Trump's response to that rigged setup question was just about
[02:56:28.662 --> 02:56:29.662]  perfect.
[02:56:29.662 --> 02:56:32.381]  I don't know if he could have answered that question better.
[02:56:32.381 --> 02:56:35.221]   But more importantly, this just doesn't resonate with voters.
[02:56:35.248 --> 02:56:38.010]  Voters do not care about January 6th.
[02:56:38.110 --> 02:56:39.091]  It just doesn't matter.
[02:56:39.111 --> 02:56:47.078]  I don't think the undecided voter is sitting here biting their nails over January 6th or, you know, what Trump did or didn't do on that day.
[02:56:47.338 --> 02:56:48.659]  I just don't think it registers.
[02:56:49.400 --> 02:56:51.161]  But generally speaking, I think most people know.
[02:56:51.181 --> 02:56:51.522]  I totally agree.
[02:56:51.582 --> 02:56:52.162]  Let's go back to Trump.
[02:56:52.182 --> 02:56:52.623]  We'll go back to you.
[02:56:52.643 --> 02:56:53.083]  Here's Trump.
[02:56:53.243 --> 02:56:54.504]  Lives of so many people.
[02:56:55.245 --> 02:57:00.518]   When they ripped down Portland, when they ripped down Many other cities.
[02:57:00.718 --> 02:57:05.840]  You go to Minnesota, Minneapolis, what they've done there with the fires all over the city.
[02:57:05.880 --> 02:57:08.801]  If I didn't bring in the National Guard, that city would have been destroyed.
[02:57:09.441 --> 02:57:13.602]  When you look at all of it, they took over big chunks of Seattle.
[02:57:13.642 --> 02:57:15.503]  I was all set to bring in the National Guard.
[02:57:15.543 --> 02:57:18.584]  They heard that, they saw them coming and they left immediately.
[02:57:19.384 --> 02:57:24.525]  What he said about this whole subject is so off, peacefully patriotic.
[02:57:24.685 --> 02:57:33.878]   One other thing, the Unselect committee, which is basically two horrible Republicans that are all gone now.
[02:57:34.178 --> 02:57:35.579]  And Democrats, all Democrats.
[02:57:36.039 --> 02:57:41.143]  They destroyed and deleted all of the information they found because they found out we were right.
[02:57:41.183 --> 02:57:42.344]  We were right.
[02:57:42.784 --> 02:57:45.206]  And they deleted and destroyed all of the information.
[02:57:45.246 --> 02:57:46.767]  They should go to jail for that.
[02:57:47.067 --> 02:57:48.668]  If a Republican did that, they'd go to jail.
[02:57:48.688 --> 02:57:49.509]  Thank you, President Trump.
[02:57:49.549 --> 02:57:50.169]  President Biden.
[02:57:51.417 --> 02:57:55.559]  The only person on this stage is a convicted felon is the man I'm looking at.
[02:57:55.919 --> 02:58:00.062]  And the fact of the matter is... And if Trump defends himself, it breaks the gag order.
[02:58:00.082 --> 02:58:07.505]  The fact is that there was no effort on his part to stop what was going on up in Capitol Hill.
[02:58:07.646 --> 02:58:11.107]  So Biden directed his Soros people to do this, and now he just called him a criminal.
[02:58:11.508 --> 02:58:13.268]  Trump's about to tear him a new asshole.
[02:58:13.288 --> 02:58:13.849]  Get ready.
[02:58:13.929 --> 02:58:15.730]  It's happening right now.
[02:58:15.770 --> 02:58:16.090]  Get ready.
[02:58:16.130 --> 02:58:16.630]  Trump's ready.
[02:58:17.191 --> 02:58:17.591]  Here we go.
[02:58:20.858 --> 02:58:24.221]  The idea is that those people are patriots?
[02:58:25.042 --> 02:58:25.402]  Come on!
[02:58:25.802 --> 02:58:30.226]  You're asking the first time around.
[02:58:30.826 --> 02:58:32.888]  I said, will you denounce the Proud Boys?
[02:58:33.408 --> 02:58:35.250]  He said, no, I'll tell them to stay in line.
[02:58:35.890 --> 02:58:39.093]  The idea he's refusing to, will you denounce these guys?
[02:58:39.113 --> 02:58:41.514]  Will you denounce the people we're talking about now?
[02:58:41.995 --> 02:58:43.516]  Will you denounce the people who attacked that?
[02:58:43.556 --> 02:58:44.417]  What are you going to do?
[02:58:47.651 --> 02:58:52.223]  I'm going to give you a minute, President Trump, for a follow-up question I have.
[02:58:54.168 --> 02:58:54.808]  Boom.
[02:58:54.868 --> 02:58:56.389]  Didn't want Trump responding.
[02:58:56.589 --> 02:58:57.530]  There's the rigging.
[02:58:57.550 --> 02:58:57.750]  Boom.
[02:58:57.810 --> 02:59:01.993]  So Trump didn't just get to respond to that crap by Biden.
[02:59:02.053 --> 02:59:02.813]  I told you.
[02:59:03.053 --> 02:59:03.634]  That's the rigging.
[02:59:03.654 --> 02:59:04.454]  This is totally rigged.
[02:59:04.474 --> 02:59:05.635]  Trump shouldn't have done that.
[02:59:05.454 --> 02:59:10.454]  I told you, that's the rigging, this is totally rigged.
[02:59:10.454 --> 02:59:13.694]   ...exactly what it means about you feeling you have every right to go after your political
[02:59:13.694 --> 02:59:14.694]  opponents.
[02:59:14.694 --> 02:59:18.414]   Well I said my retribution is going to be successful, we're going to make this country
[02:59:18.414 --> 02:59:19.894]  successful again because right now...
[02:59:19.894 --> 02:59:21.895]  Trump should let him do that, he's done a great job so far.
[02:59:21.895 --> 02:59:25.694]   My retribution is going to be a success, but when he talks about a convicted felon, his
[02:59:25.694 --> 02:59:28.694]  son is a convicted felon at a very high level.
[02:59:28.809 --> 02:59:31.970]  His son is convicted, going to be convicted probably numerous other times.
[02:59:32.450 --> 02:59:39.092]  Should have been convicted before, but his Justice Department let the statute of limitations lapse in the most important way.
[02:59:39.112 --> 02:59:41.913]  But he could be a convicted felon as soon as he gets out of office.
[02:59:41.973 --> 02:59:45.074]  Joe could be a convicted felon with all of the things that he's done.
[02:59:45.414 --> 02:59:46.434]  He's done horrible things.
[02:59:46.874 --> 02:59:48.855]  All of the death cause at the border.
[02:59:49.675 --> 02:59:54.718]  Telling the Ukrainian people that we're going to want a billion dollars or you change the prosecutor.
[02:59:55.178 --> 02:59:56.759]  Otherwise, you're not getting a billion dollars.
[02:59:56.819 --> 02:59:59.781]  If I ever said that, that's quid pro quo.
[03:00:00.721 --> 03:00:01.822]  We're not going to do anything.
[03:00:01.842 --> 03:00:04.803]  We're not going to get a billion dollars unless you change the prosecutor.
[03:00:06.618 --> 03:00:07.658]  This man is a criminal.
[03:00:08.099 --> 03:00:09.099]  This man... You're lucky.
[03:00:09.399 --> 03:00:09.879]  You're lucky.
[03:00:10.179 --> 03:00:11.160]  I did nothing wrong.
[03:00:11.500 --> 03:00:14.101]  We'd have a system that was rigged and disgusting.
[03:00:14.221 --> 03:00:15.041]  I did nothing wrong.
[03:00:15.361 --> 03:00:16.341]  Thank you, President Trump.
[03:00:16.361 --> 03:00:20.723]  President Biden, you have said... Well, you want to respond?
[03:00:20.763 --> 03:00:20.943]  Go ahead.
[03:00:20.963 --> 03:00:21.943]  I'll give you a minute to respond.
[03:00:22.423 --> 03:00:27.685]  The idea that I did anything wrong relative to what you're talking about is outrageous.
[03:00:28.245 --> 03:00:29.726]  I'm marking it down.
[03:00:29.866 --> 03:00:32.647]  They've given Biden, so far, 40 minutes into this.
[03:00:32.687 --> 03:00:33.847]  Five extra minutes.
[03:00:36.243 --> 03:00:36.803]  That's game.
[03:00:36.843 --> 03:00:37.124]  Wrong.
[03:00:37.704 --> 03:00:38.244]  Simply wrong.
[03:00:38.284 --> 03:00:39.926]  No president's ever spoken like that before.
[03:00:39.946 --> 03:00:40.786]  Is Trump going to respond back?
[03:00:40.806 --> 03:00:42.748]  No president in our history has spoken like that before.
[03:00:43.228 --> 03:00:43.728]  Number three.
[03:00:43.768 --> 03:00:45.209]  Disgusting pedophile.
[03:00:45.409 --> 03:00:47.291]  You are still raising your daughter in the shower.
[03:00:47.331 --> 03:00:48.532]  You degenerate scumbag.
[03:00:48.552 --> 03:00:53.555]  How many billions of dollars do you owe in civil penalties for molesting a woman in public?
[03:00:53.895 --> 03:00:54.536]  You're a pedophile.
[03:00:57.078 --> 03:00:57.618]  You're a pedophile.
[03:00:57.438 --> 03:00:58.438]  You're a pedophile.
[03:00:58.438 --> 03:00:59.438]  You're a pedophile.
[03:00:59.438 --> 03:01:00.438]  You're a pedophile.
[03:01:00.438 --> 03:01:01.438]  You're a pedophile.
[03:01:01.438 --> 03:01:02.438]  What are you talking about?
[03:01:02.438 --> 03:01:03.438]  You're the morals of an alley cat.
[03:01:03.438 --> 03:01:04.438]  Do you have your answer?
[03:01:04.438 --> 03:01:10.438]  I didn't have sex with a porn star, number one.
[03:01:10.853 --> 03:01:14.056]  Number two, that was a case that was started and moved.
[03:01:14.116 --> 03:01:19.880]  They moved a high-ranking official, a DOJ, into the Manhattan DA's office to start that case.
[03:01:20.321 --> 03:01:22.062]  That case is going to be appealed and won.
[03:01:22.643 --> 03:01:26.766]  We had a very terrible judge, a horrible judge, Democrat.
[03:01:27.346 --> 03:01:30.169]  The prosecutor were all high-ranking Democrats.
[03:01:34.812 --> 03:01:39.336]  He basically went after his political opponent because he thought it was going to damage me.
[03:01:39.376 --> 03:01:44.740]  But when the public found out about these cases, because they understand it better than he does, he has no idea what these cases are.
[03:01:45.141 --> 03:01:48.003]  But when they found out about these cases, you know what they did?
[03:01:48.343 --> 03:01:49.745]  My poll numbers went up way up.
[03:01:49.865 --> 03:01:51.346]  You know that because you're reporting it.
[03:01:51.366 --> 03:01:57.551]  We took in more money in the last two weeks than we've ever taken in in the history of any campaign.
[03:01:57.571 --> 03:01:58.572]  I don't think any campaign.
[03:01:59.493 --> 03:02:10.341]  Thank you President Trump.
[03:02:10.362 --> 03:02:17.387]  President Biden, you have said, quote, Donald Trump and his MAGA Republicans are determined to destroy American democracy.
[03:02:17.868 --> 03:02:25.434]  Do you believe that the tens of millions of Americans who are likely to vote for President Trump will be voting against American democracy?
[03:02:26.141 --> 03:02:27.782]  The more they know about what he's done, yes.
[03:02:27.802 --> 03:02:28.923]  Another rigged question.
[03:02:28.943 --> 03:02:30.204]  The more they know about what he's done.
[03:02:30.224 --> 03:02:32.105]  People voting is now against democracy.
[03:02:32.145 --> 03:02:34.206]  He's got a lot of cases down the road coming out.
[03:02:34.687 --> 03:02:36.888]  He's got a lot of cases, see?
[03:02:37.248 --> 03:02:38.889]  To stop him from you being able to vote for him.
[03:02:38.949 --> 03:02:42.131]  I don't know what the juries will do, but I do know he has a real problem.
[03:02:42.772 --> 03:02:44.173]  Boom, bitch!
[03:02:44.373 --> 03:02:45.233]  Get out the way!
[03:02:45.253 --> 03:02:46.414]  Move out the way, bitch!
[03:02:46.454 --> 03:02:47.295]  Get out the way!
[03:02:47.315 --> 03:02:52.018]  You ever hear the president say that, I thought HIPPA had some good ideas?
[03:02:52.358 --> 03:02:53.719]  What got me involved... Never said that.
[03:02:57.915 --> 03:03:01.798]  I said I wasn't going to run again until I saw what happened in Charlottesville, Virginia.
[03:03:02.219 --> 03:03:09.204]  People coming out of the woods carrying swastikas on torches, torches, and singing the same anti-Semitic... Oh my God!
[03:03:09.264 --> 03:03:13.267]  They sang when... Well, he signs with the Islamists that are complete Nazis.
[03:03:13.287 --> 03:03:15.148]  A young woman got killed when I spoke to the mother.
[03:03:16.309 --> 03:03:19.451]  They asked him, they said, what do you think of those people?
[03:03:19.912 --> 03:03:20.832]  No one's right.
[03:03:20.932 --> 03:03:22.434]  Nobody's buying this lie.
[03:03:22.794 --> 03:03:24.875]  And the ones he said, I think they're fine people.
[03:03:24.975 --> 03:03:25.596]  No, he said...
[03:03:26.377 --> 03:03:29.178]  What Nazi president would ever say?
[03:03:29.778 --> 03:03:37.601]  Nazis coming out of fields, carrying torches, singing the same antisemitic bile, carrying swastikas for fine people.
[03:03:38.321 --> 03:03:40.521]  This is a guy who says Hitler's done some good things.
[03:03:40.922 --> 03:03:41.942]  I'd like to know what they are.
[03:03:41.962 --> 03:03:44.163]  The good things Hitler's done, that's what he said.
[03:03:44.623 --> 03:03:46.843]  This guy has no sense of American democracy.
[03:03:48.104 --> 03:03:48.604]  President Trump.
[03:03:49.024 --> 03:03:52.525]  Jake, both of you know that, sir, has been totally wiped out.
[03:03:52.945 --> 03:03:57.912]   Because when you see the sentence, it said A hundred percent exoneration on that story.
[03:03:58.013 --> 03:04:01.896]  Even Snopes says Trump didn't say that.
[03:04:02.377 --> 03:04:04.158]  He ran because it was his last chance.
[03:04:05.179 --> 03:04:06.581]  He's not equipped to be president.
[03:04:06.661 --> 03:04:07.642]  You know it and I know it.
[03:04:07.702 --> 03:04:08.322]  It's ridiculous.
[03:04:08.362 --> 03:04:08.943]  We have a debate.
[03:04:09.343 --> 03:04:11.405]  We're trying to justify his presidency.
[03:04:13.687 --> 03:04:18.731]  Without question, the worst president, the worst presidency in the history of our country.
[03:04:19.171 --> 03:04:20.832]  We shouldn't be having a debate about it.
[03:04:20.872 --> 03:04:21.913]  There's nothing to debate.
[03:04:22.293 --> 03:04:26.556]  He made up the Charlottesville story, and you'll see it's debunked all over the place.
[03:04:26.996 --> 03:04:30.698]  Every anchor, every reasonable anchor, has debunked it.
[03:04:31.159 --> 03:04:34.201]  And just the other day it came out where it was fully debunked.
[03:04:34.741 --> 03:04:36.522]  It's a nonsense story.
[03:04:36.582 --> 03:04:39.144]  He knows that, and he didn't run because of Charlottesville.
[03:04:39.184 --> 03:04:40.585]  He used that as an excuse to run.
[03:04:41.849 --> 03:04:45.150]  And now that Biden's gonna talk, let's play Ludacris right now.
[03:04:45.190 --> 03:04:45.490]  Move, bitch!
[03:04:45.510 --> 03:04:45.910]  Get out the way!
[03:04:45.950 --> 03:04:46.310]  Move, bitch!
[03:04:46.611 --> 03:04:56.320]   And the idea that somehow that's gonna... "Move bitch! Get out the way!" He thought that there was this people coming
[03:04:56.320 --> 03:05:01.611]   out of that off, so for it to turn into a torture, it needed to turn into a torture.
[03:05:01.611 --> 03:05:17.611]   "Move bitch! Get out the way! Get out the way bitch! Get out the way!"
[03:05:17.611 --> 03:05:22.881]  "Oh no! The fight's out! I'm about to punch your lights out!
[03:05:22.881 --> 03:05:30.790]   Get the fuck back! Guard the grill! It's something wrong, we can't stay still! I've been drinking and fussing too,
[03:05:30.790 --> 03:05:37.611]   and I've been thinking of fussing you, oh, like a motherfucking forehead! And if your friends jump in..."
[03:05:37.611 --> 03:05:42.611]  "Alright, they're going to break."
[03:05:42.611 --> 03:05:43.451]  Bye.
[03:05:43.946 --> 03:05:49.988]  Trump just did 45 minutes and knocked the living hell out of Biden.
[03:05:50.128 --> 03:05:51.449]  All the questions are anti-Trump.
[03:05:51.789 --> 03:05:53.350]  They shaved six, seven minutes off Trump.
[03:05:53.950 --> 03:05:58.592]  But despite all the rigging, let's not watch their ad.
[03:05:58.411 --> 03:06:00.810]  Let's go back to the Ludacris song. Go on, keep rolling.
[03:06:00.810 --> 03:06:06.811]  See them headlights?
[03:06:07.689 --> 03:06:09.532]  I'm DUI, I never pull over.
[03:06:09.552 --> 03:06:11.475]  You better move the fuck over.
[03:06:15.586 --> 03:06:17.207]  Bitch, get out the way!
[03:06:17.307 --> 03:06:18.508]  Move, bitch!
[03:06:18.628 --> 03:06:19.649]  Get out the way!
[03:06:19.969 --> 03:06:21.270]  Get out the way, bitch!
[03:06:21.290 --> 03:06:22.371]  Get out the way!
[03:06:22.691 --> 03:06:24.232]  Here I come!
[03:06:24.372 --> 03:06:25.332]  Here I go!
[03:06:25.473 --> 03:06:26.333]  Uh-oh!

[03:06:27.814 --> 03:06:29.375]  You see them headlights?
[03:06:29.435 --> 03:06:30.956]  You hear that fuckin' crowd?
[03:06:30.976 --> 03:06:32.377]  Stop that goddamn show!
[03:06:32.477 --> 03:06:33.658]  Come and do it!
[03:06:33.758 --> 03:06:34.498]  Hit the stage!
[03:06:34.539 --> 03:06:36.140]  Knock the curtains back!
[03:06:36.240 --> 03:06:37.721]  I'm fuckin' proud of it!
[03:06:37.761 --> 03:06:38.781]  That's what I do!
[03:06:38.881 --> 03:06:40.462]  Young and successful!
[03:06:40.582 --> 03:06:41.103]  Sexy!
[03:06:41.263 --> 03:06:43.144]  Them bitches want me to rock!
[03:06:43.164 --> 03:06:44.085]  True, true!
[03:06:44.605 --> 03:06:45.506]  Hold up, wait up shorty.
[03:06:45.526 --> 03:06:47.188]  Oh, all one side.
[03:06:47.308 --> 03:06:48.269]  Get my dicks out.
[03:06:48.689 --> 03:06:49.730]  What are you doing?
[03:06:49.990 --> 03:06:51.011]  Beside mine.
[03:06:51.051 --> 03:06:52.292]  These my fucking bitches.
[03:06:52.392 --> 03:06:53.333]  Trying to get my baby.
[03:06:53.713 --> 03:06:54.774]  Child support suit.
[03:06:55.395 --> 03:06:56.976]  Give me that fucking JK Reynolds back.
[03:06:57.497 --> 03:06:59.719]  Who bought these fucking TVs in the jury, bitch?
[03:06:59.859 --> 03:07:00.460]  Hand me that.
[03:07:00.800 --> 03:07:01.501]  No, I ain't bitter.
[03:07:01.521 --> 03:07:02.401]  I don't give a fuck.
[03:07:02.882 --> 03:07:05.785]  But if I take it like this, bitch, you better not walk in front of my tour bus.
[03:07:05.885 --> 03:07:07.086]  Move, bitch.
[03:07:07.226 --> 03:07:08.127]  Get out the way.
[03:07:08.187 --> 03:07:09.488]  Get out the way, bitch.
[03:07:12.790 --> 03:07:21.610]   Get out the way, get out the way, bitch, get out the way Move, bitch, get out the way, bitch, get out the way

[03:08:07.250 --> 03:08:14.509]   All you baggin' motherfuckers ain't ready for two O's Get out the way, get out the way bitch.
[03:08:14.344 --> 03:08:15.165]  We're done.
[03:08:15.225 --> 03:08:21.089]  Let's go back to their stupid mattress commercials on CNN.
[03:08:20.948 --> 03:08:24.148]  We played them before we beat Hillary.
[03:08:24.148 --> 03:08:28.988]  So many years ago, almost 8 years ago folks.
[03:08:28.988 --> 03:08:31.348]  And we're just saying get out the way, we're done.
[03:08:31.348 --> 03:08:34.748]  Let's go back to their stupid mattress commercials on CNN.
[03:08:34.748 --> 03:08:38.428]  I mean CNN has no viewers until now.
[03:08:38.923 --> 03:08:39.704]  Whoever wants to jump on.
[03:08:39.724 --> 03:08:41.785]  Harrison, Owen, Chase.
[03:08:41.825 --> 03:08:43.126]  Yeah, fade down the mattress commercial.
[03:08:43.166 --> 03:08:44.187]  You guys want to comment on this?
[03:08:44.487 --> 03:08:45.868]  Yeah, well, it's Biden nap time.
[03:08:46.068 --> 03:08:49.591]  This mattress commercial is brought to you by a good Biden nap.
[03:08:50.152 --> 03:08:52.133]  So they had to make sure to squeeze in a Biden nap time.
[03:08:52.894 --> 03:08:54.175]  Ludacris is from Atlanta.
[03:08:54.375 --> 03:08:55.416]  The debate is in Atlanta.
[03:08:55.235 --> 03:08:59.074]  So that's very, that's some local color there, Alex.
[03:08:59.074 --> 03:09:05.715]  Keep going.
[03:09:05.771 --> 03:09:11.078]  Well, I would just say that, you know, there's no doubt Biden has gotten more time.
[03:09:11.098 --> 03:09:15.164]  I think, I mean, I don't have the, I'm not with a clicker, but I think Alex was probably right.
[03:09:15.184 --> 03:09:17.226]  I think he's probably gotten about five extra minutes.
[03:09:18.508 --> 03:09:21.913]  I think, though, Trump has kind of allowed that to happen strategically.
[03:09:22.812 --> 03:09:31.443]  I think that Trump has allowed that strategically where he's just putting out concise responses and then just saying, go ahead Joe, go ahead and talk more.
[03:09:31.463 --> 03:09:33.325]  Because it's just not working.
[03:09:33.526 --> 03:09:36.750]  I don't think Biden is winning any voters tonight.
[03:09:36.770 --> 03:09:38.932]  So I think strategically that's going on.
[03:09:38.972 --> 03:09:40.074]  Is this them back live guys?
[03:09:40.694 --> 03:09:40.895]  Yeah.
[03:09:41.492 --> 03:09:43.492]  All right, we're about to go back to your live.
[03:09:43.492 --> 03:09:47.732]   Still three times more likely to die for pregnancy related causes
[03:09:47.732 --> 03:09:52.612]   and black Americans are imprisoned at five times the rate of white Americans.
[03:09:52.612 --> 03:09:57.011]   What do you say to black voters who are disappointed that you have these questions?
[03:09:57.011 --> 03:10:01.092]   Are all rigged. It's all left. That's how the rigging is the question.
[03:10:01.092 --> 03:10:02.592]  matters more small.
[03:10:02.608 --> 03:10:17.887]   By the way I sent you the clip this morning again of him saying if you are black and I catch you with one little piece of crack 20 years in prison next up next to a son smoking crack Can we get that footage to type in?
[03:10:18.347 --> 03:10:21.609]  Biden talks about crack smoking on X. I sent to you this morning again.
[03:10:21.629 --> 03:10:23.129]  I sent to you yesterday.
[03:10:23.250 --> 03:10:24.610]  Cue that up.
[03:10:24.750 --> 03:10:29.193]  Because if you want to just get Biden, folks, them giving him more time, all the cheating, go see the feed with them.
[03:10:29.253 --> 03:10:30.333]  We're here giving commentary.
[03:10:30.913 --> 03:10:32.694]  We're like, move, bitch!
[03:10:33.034 --> 03:10:34.055]  Get out the way!
[03:10:34.335 --> 03:10:35.476]  Get out the way, bitch!
[03:10:35.536 --> 03:10:36.476]  Move out the way!
[03:10:36.816 --> 03:10:37.777]  Move, bitch!
[03:10:38.077 --> 03:10:39.017]  Get out the way!
[03:10:39.278 --> 03:10:40.378]  Get out the way, bitch!
[03:10:40.438 --> 03:10:41.319]  Get out the way!
[03:10:41.339 --> 03:10:43.019]  We don't want your World War III.
[03:10:43.120 --> 03:10:43.660]  We don't want your...
[03:10:46.636 --> 03:10:47.457]  Triple the prices.
[03:10:47.517 --> 03:10:49.138]  We don't want your New World Order.
[03:10:49.358 --> 03:10:50.999]  We don't want your drag queen story time.
[03:10:51.239 --> 03:10:52.259]  We don't want your world government.
[03:10:52.279 --> 03:10:54.101]  We don't want the military wearing red high heels.
[03:10:54.401 --> 03:10:55.361]  We reject it all.
[03:10:55.702 --> 03:10:56.382]  Move, bitch.
[03:10:56.702 --> 03:10:57.523]  Get out the way.
[03:10:57.903 --> 03:10:58.863]  Get out the way, bitch.
[03:10:58.923 --> 03:10:59.584]  Move out the way.
[03:11:00.939 --> 03:11:04.001]  Find that clip of him saying blacks are predators, put them all in prison.
[03:11:04.222 --> 03:11:05.142]  I mean, just fuck him.
[03:11:05.162 --> 03:11:06.884]  I mean, Trump never said that shit.
[03:11:06.904 --> 03:11:11.287]  I'm not going to listen to this KKK leader run his mouth anymore.
[03:11:11.327 --> 03:11:13.429]  Go back to this crackhead pedophile.
[03:11:13.489 --> 03:11:16.992]  Go back to that crackhead pedophile and the CIA whore talking to him.
[03:11:17.292 --> 03:11:19.013]  Sir, I don't blame you for being disappointed.
[03:11:19.433 --> 03:11:20.634]  Inflation is still hurting.
[03:11:20.654 --> 03:11:22.276]  Let's give the son of a bitch like three minutes.
[03:11:22.856 --> 03:11:24.017]  Goes on and on and on.
[03:11:24.057 --> 03:11:24.978]  I've been marking it down.
[03:11:25.378 --> 03:11:26.939]  You got like seven minutes extra.
[03:11:26.959 --> 03:11:28.881]  I should get a $10,000 tax credit.
[03:11:29.381 --> 03:11:31.203]  Oh yeah, he loves black people, folks.
[03:11:31.503 --> 03:11:33.604]  Loves killing them.
[03:11:33.684 --> 03:11:36.106]  Not sit in the pool with the black cockroaches!
[03:11:36.126 --> 03:11:36.667]  You know what?
[03:11:36.727 --> 03:11:38.308]  We're gonna let Trump respond.
[03:11:38.188 --> 03:11:43.228]   They had to take out student loans that were not sitting in the pool with the black cockroaches.
[03:11:43.228 --> 03:11:48.027]   And they'd never seen a doctor and anything having to do with volunteers.
[03:11:48.027 --> 03:11:53.388]   And if they paid their bills for 10 years and their student debt, all the rest is forgiven.
[03:11:53.388 --> 03:11:54.188]  You know what?
[03:11:54.188 --> 03:11:55.227]  We're gonna let Trump respond.
[03:11:55.227 --> 03:11:57.788]  I'm gonna play one of those crack cocaine comments.
[03:11:57.788 --> 03:12:00.667]  Shut up pedophile.
[03:12:00.784 --> 03:12:02.306]  Shut up, you degenerate pedophile!
[03:12:03.267 --> 03:12:06.490]  He's blaming inflation, and he's right, it's been very bad.
[03:12:07.151 --> 03:12:11.976]  He caused the inflation, and it's killing black families, and hispanic families, and just about everybody.
[03:12:11.997 --> 03:12:15.741]  He's the one cutting the energy off, that's what causes the inflation.
[03:12:15.781 --> 03:12:19.925]  When you cut the goddamn energy off, that causes the inflation, that's the number one thing.
[03:12:20.888 --> 03:12:21.629]  They can't live.
[03:12:21.889 --> 03:12:23.050]  They're not living anymore.
[03:12:23.370 --> 03:12:29.556]  That's how Trump could increase spending but have lower taxes because the energy was cheaper.
[03:12:29.896 --> 03:12:30.556]  Dumbass!
[03:12:30.877 --> 03:12:32.118]  That's what everything is.
[03:12:32.158 --> 03:12:34.840]  The fuel and the electricity and the fertilizer.
[03:12:35.180 --> 03:12:36.582]  It's energy, dumbass!
[03:12:36.662 --> 03:12:38.263]  Money that's being thrown out the window.
[03:12:38.703 --> 03:12:39.824]  He caused inflation.
[03:12:40.245 --> 03:12:50.007]   As sure as you're sitting there, The fact is that his big kill on the black people is the millions of people that he's allowed to come in through the border.
[03:12:50.047 --> 03:13:04.077]  They're taking black jobs now, and it could be 18, it could be 19, and even 20 million people are taking black jobs, and they're taking Hispanic jobs, and you haven't seen it yet, but you're going to see something that's going to be the worst in our history.
[03:13:04.157 --> 03:13:05.278]  Thank you, President Biden.
[03:13:06.351 --> 03:13:07.612]  There was no inflation.
[03:13:08.033 --> 03:13:11.396]  By the way, you just saw Biden get 3 minutes, Trump just got 60 seconds.
[03:13:11.677 --> 03:13:16.481]  So now Biden's 10 minutes ahead of Trump, or 9 minutes.
[03:13:16.682 --> 03:13:18.564]  So, I mean, I'm watching this.
[03:13:18.604 --> 03:13:19.625]  You're watching it too, right?
[03:13:19.645 --> 03:13:22.107]  That's why I'm talking over him.
[03:13:22.086 --> 03:13:24.086]  The son of a bitch is talking the whole time.
[03:13:24.086 --> 03:13:27.127]  We're involved communities including minority communities.
[03:13:27.127 --> 03:13:29.367]  We made sure that they have health insurance.
[03:13:29.367 --> 03:13:33.605]  Move bitch. Yeah. Oh, oh black seed to take the shot.
[03:13:33.753 --> 03:13:34.594]  We shouldn't take it.
[03:13:34.634 --> 03:13:35.535]  Let the blacks take it.
[03:13:35.575 --> 03:13:36.156]  I love you.
[03:13:36.176 --> 03:13:42.124]  If you don't vote for me, you ain't black.
[03:13:42.264 --> 03:13:43.445]  Move, bitch.
[03:13:43.646 --> 03:13:44.647]  Get out the way.
[03:13:44.947 --> 03:13:46.029]  Get out the way, bitch.
[03:13:46.049 --> 03:13:46.509]  Get out the way.
[03:13:46.670 --> 03:13:48.372]  Does he ever shut the fuck up?
[03:13:49.201 --> 03:13:53.105]  He's been going on for fucking, I mean, that's like 15 minutes more now.
[03:13:53.505 --> 03:13:54.186]  Shut up!
[03:13:54.206 --> 03:13:57.789]  I mean, serious folks, I'm keeping score right here.
[03:13:58.650 --> 03:14:01.453]  It's over 10 minutes extra of this guy in less than an hour.
[03:14:01.713 --> 03:14:03.075]  Trump, you now get 10 seconds.
[03:14:02.894 --> 03:14:10.733]   going on. Trump you now get 10 seconds Biden you get 3 minutes. Trump you get 1 minute.
[03:14:10.890 --> 03:14:13.532]  Biden, you get four minutes.
[03:14:13.692 --> 03:14:14.753]  Oh, the climate crisis!
[03:14:14.953 --> 03:14:16.174]  Yeah, cut off the power!
[03:14:16.234 --> 03:14:18.776]  It is not the hottest year in recorded history!
[03:14:18.937 --> 03:14:19.577]  You're lying!
[03:14:19.456 --> 03:14:21.815]  It is not the hottest year in recorded history.
[03:14:21.815 --> 03:14:24.316]  You lying fraud.
[03:14:24.316 --> 03:14:26.816]  -Intensifying wildfires, stronger hurricanes.
[03:14:26.816 --> 03:14:29.055]  -Leftist starting fires everywhere.
[03:14:29.055 --> 03:14:31.456]  -Former President Trump -- -These questions are totally rigged.
[03:14:31.410 --> 03:14:33.472]  How close the police are to him.
[03:14:33.652 --> 03:14:37.536]  Almost every police group in the nation is supporting Donald J. Trump.
[03:14:37.355 --> 03:14:42.155]  Let me just go back to what he said about the police.
[03:14:42.155 --> 03:14:44.376]  How close the police are to him.
[03:14:44.376 --> 03:14:50.774]   Almost every police group in the nation is supporting Donald J. Trump.
[03:14:50.774 --> 03:14:52.575]  Almost every police group.
[03:14:52.575 --> 03:14:57.175]   And what he's done to the black population is horrible, including the fact that for 10
[03:14:57.175 --> 03:14:58.735]  years he called them super predators.
[03:14:58.738 --> 03:15:00.739]  We can't, in the 1990s, we can't forget that.
[03:15:01.120 --> 03:15:06.905]  Super Predators was his name, and he called it to them, and they've taken great offense at it, and now they see it happening.
[03:15:07.580 --> 03:15:16.525]  But when they see what I did for criminal justice reform and for the historically black colleges and universities, where I funded them and got them all funded.
[03:15:16.565 --> 03:15:17.145]  Double funded?
[03:15:17.185 --> 03:15:20.347]  The Opportunity Zones with Tim, as you know.
[03:15:20.407 --> 03:15:21.948]  Tim Scott was incredible.
[03:15:21.968 --> 03:15:22.829]  He did a great job.
[03:15:23.169 --> 03:15:24.910]  Great senator from South Carolina.
[03:15:25.370 --> 03:15:27.471]  He came to me with the idea and it was a great idea.
[03:15:27.491 --> 03:15:31.473]  It's one of the most successful economic development acts ever in the country.
[03:15:31.613 --> 03:15:32.494]  Opportunity Zones.
[03:15:33.146 --> 03:15:40.288]  And the biggest beneficiary are blacks and that's why we have the best numbers with them in maybe ever.
[03:15:40.409 --> 03:15:41.149]  They're saying ever.
[03:15:41.189 --> 03:15:43.370]  I read this morning where ever the best numbers.
[03:15:44.210 --> 03:15:49.952]  He's lost much of the black population because he's done a horrible job for black people.
[03:15:50.212 --> 03:15:52.993]  He's also done a horrible job for Hispanics.
[03:15:53.253 --> 03:16:00.776]  But when you see these millions of people pouring into our country and they're going to take the jobs and it's already started and you haven't seen anything yet.
[03:16:00.896 --> 03:16:01.676]  It's a disaster.
[03:16:03.071 --> 03:16:04.752]  38 seconds left, President Trump.
[03:16:04.812 --> 03:16:09.055]  Will you take any action as president to slow the climate crisis?
[03:16:09.916 --> 03:16:12.657]  I want absolutely immaculate, clean water.
[03:16:12.677 --> 03:16:15.419]  And I want absolutely clean air.
[03:16:15.439 --> 03:16:16.340]  And we had it.
[03:16:16.840 --> 03:16:17.941]  We had H2O.
[03:16:18.261 --> 03:16:19.982]  We had the best numbers ever.
[03:16:20.940 --> 03:16:23.621]  I don't know where the hell he's been.
[03:16:23.440 --> 03:16:25.980]  Plants put out a CO2 and water.
[03:16:25.980 --> 03:16:31.680]   And yet during my four years, I had the best environmental numbers ever.
[03:16:31.680 --> 03:16:36.640]   And my top environmental people gave me that statistic just before I walked on the stage actually.
[03:16:36.640 --> 03:16:40.319]  I don't know where the hell he's been.
[03:16:40.319 --> 03:16:43.479]  The idea that Andy he said is true.
[03:16:43.479 --> 03:16:45.520]  He's a fucking pedophile.
[03:16:45.520 --> 03:16:46.360]  Fuck you.
[03:16:46.360 --> 03:16:49.319]  Most extensive climate change legislation in history.
[03:16:49.319 --> 03:16:51.959]  You gotta cut off all our energy and kill us?
[03:16:51.959 --> 03:16:57.640]   Well, China makes no cuts in Mexico and India and all our jobs go over there, you lion sack of crap.
[03:16:57.640 --> 03:16:59.839]  Here, let's hear him on crack.
[03:16:59.839 --> 03:17:01.440]  Play the crack clip, here it is.
[03:17:01.440 --> 03:17:08.799]   If you have a piece of crack cocaine, Okay.
[03:17:09.665 --> 03:17:12.829]  No bigger than this quarter that I'm holding in my hand.
[03:17:13.369 --> 03:17:14.611]  One quarter of one dollar.
[03:17:15.532 --> 03:17:19.296]  We passed a law through the leadership of Senator Thurmond and myself and others.
[03:17:19.997 --> 03:17:34.755]   A law that says, you're caught with that, you go to jail for five years, you get no probation, you get Nothing other than five years in jail.
[03:17:35.355 --> 03:17:36.757]  Judge doesn't have a choice.
[03:17:37.157 --> 03:17:43.304]  Under our forfeiture statutes, you can, the government can, take everything you own.
[03:17:44.250 --> 03:17:56.318]  Everything from your car to your house, your bank account, not merely what they confiscate in terms of the dollars from the transaction that you just got caught engaging in.
[03:17:56.338 --> 03:17:57.659]  They take everything.
[03:17:57.899 --> 03:18:00.301]  I don't care why they become a sociopath.
[03:18:00.941 --> 03:18:05.364]  We have an obligation to cordon them off from the rest of society.
[03:18:05.704 --> 03:18:07.045]  They are in jail.
[03:18:08.926 --> 03:18:12.909]  Away from my mother, your husband, our families.
[03:18:13.596 --> 03:18:17.117]  So I want to ask, what made them do this?
[03:18:17.817 --> 03:18:20.478]  They must be taken off the street.
[03:18:22.059 --> 03:18:24.739]  We'll get you to the Super Printer Club, but back to Trump.
[03:18:26.000 --> 03:18:29.881]  ...over our schools, our hospitals, and they're going to be taking over Social Security.
[03:18:30.201 --> 03:18:33.722]  He is destroying Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
[03:18:37.246 --> 03:18:42.227]  The fact is, I raped my daughter in the shower.
[03:18:42.267 --> 03:18:45.468]  The fact is, I'm a Russian-Chinese agent.
[03:18:45.808 --> 03:18:47.628]  The fact is, I shit my pants every day.
[03:18:47.648 --> 03:18:49.208]  The fact is, I surveil the American people.
[03:18:49.027 --> 03:18:53.826]   The United States is one of the largest polluters in the world.
[03:18:53.826 --> 03:18:54.826]  Number one.
[03:18:54.826 --> 03:18:56.067]  We're making significant progress.
[03:18:56.067 --> 03:18:59.747]  By 2035, we will have cut pollution in half.
[03:18:59.747 --> 03:19:00.747]  We have made significant progress.
[03:19:00.747 --> 03:19:01.747]  They call it carbon.
[03:19:01.747 --> 03:19:02.747]  You breathe, you exhale, it's toxic waste.
[03:19:02.747 --> 03:19:03.747]  We have a clean core.
[03:19:03.747 --> 03:19:09.746]   Thousands of young people will learn how to deal with it, just like Peace Corps.
[03:19:09.746 --> 03:19:15.347]   And we're moving in directions that are going to significantly change the elements and cause
[03:19:15.347 --> 03:19:16.027]  of pollution.
[03:19:16.494 --> 03:19:27.818]  But the idea that he claims that he has the biggest heart up here and he's really concerned about pollution and about climate, I've not seen any indication of that.
[03:19:28.258 --> 03:19:33.475]   And by the way, with regard to prescription drugs. Yeah, getting rid of cows doesn't save
[03:19:33.475 --> 03:19:39.364]   the earth. They would reduce the price to $35 which I was calling for one voluntarily. I
[03:19:39.364 --> 03:19:41.555]  made sure every company in the world.
[03:19:41.555 --> 03:19:45.235]  Every pleasure we've got away. And by the way.
[03:19:45.235 --> 03:19:50.755]   So every day millions of Americans struggle just to make ends meet.
[03:19:50.931 --> 03:19:54.873]  For many older Americans, Social Security provides a critical lifeline.
[03:19:54.893 --> 03:19:56.153]  So these questions are alright.
[03:19:56.193 --> 03:19:58.154]  Nothing is done to Social Security.
[03:19:58.235 --> 03:20:02.537]  Seniors will see their benefits cut in just over 10 years.
[03:20:03.017 --> 03:20:08.220]  Will you name tonight one specific step that you're willing to take to keep Social Security solvent?
[03:20:08.400 --> 03:20:10.901]  Yes, make the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share.
[03:20:11.576 --> 03:20:12.536]  They never do.
[03:20:12.556 --> 03:20:13.617]  They all run him.
[03:20:13.917 --> 03:20:15.657]  Biden's been given all the billionaire money.
[03:20:15.697 --> 03:20:16.558]  Trump got none of that.
[03:20:16.878 --> 03:20:17.658]  They're all exempt.
[03:20:17.698 --> 03:20:18.398]  It's all a lie.
[03:20:18.778 --> 03:20:23.020]  Every single time they get a paycheck from the time of the first one, they get when they're 18 years old.
[03:20:23.660 --> 03:20:27.821]  The idea that they're going to... Let's hear a racial jungle clip from Biden.
[03:20:27.841 --> 03:20:28.521]  We'll go back to Trump.
[03:20:29.762 --> 03:20:30.442]  Millionaires pay 1%.
[03:20:31.302 --> 03:20:33.883]  We keep talking about this thing as being North versus South.
[03:20:33.903 --> 03:20:34.703]  That's not the issue.
[03:20:35.344 --> 03:20:36.544]  It is rural versus urban.
[03:20:37.193 --> 03:20:43.175]  And most of the busing that's taken place to date has taken place in rural areas, whether it be administratively ordered or court ordered.
[03:20:43.835 --> 03:20:47.617]  Now we're moving into applying the same standards to urban areas.
[03:20:48.077 --> 03:20:50.038]  And it is a standard that doesn't make sense.
[03:20:50.238 --> 03:20:51.178]  It doesn't apply.
[03:20:51.198 --> 03:20:52.138]  It doesn't hold.
[03:20:52.519 --> 03:20:59.721]  We're moving from trying to, in urban areas, we've had integrated facilities, but segregated neighborhoods.
[03:21:00.441 --> 03:21:04.903]  And in rural areas, we've traditionally had integrated neighborhoods, but segregated facilities.
[03:21:05.430 --> 03:21:07.471]  And they've applied the same standard and the same test.
[03:21:07.851 --> 03:21:10.092]  So this North-South thing is not really the issue.
[03:21:10.452 --> 03:21:23.577]  As Professor Nathan Glazer at Harvard has indicated, as Dr. Armour of the RAND Corporation, as James Coleman, as... I just held three days of hearings, two days of hearings in the Judiciary Committee on another bill I have, beyond this that deals with busing.
[03:21:24.208 --> 03:21:31.015]  And there is uniform opinion of those who testified that it is not a North-South, it's an urban-rural question.
[03:21:31.216 --> 03:21:31.736]  Distinction.
[03:21:31.896 --> 03:21:44.730]  But no matter what your intent, there are going to be those who say it's a segregated thing, it's a question of race, and that you have set back the movement of desegregation of schools.
[03:21:44.770 --> 03:21:45.631]  How would you answer that?
[03:21:45.871 --> 03:21:52.616]  The way I answer that is I predict that the young black leadership of America will overwhelmingly decide with me.
[03:21:53.136 --> 03:22:00.681]  I predict that in 1980 and 84 my position will be totally vindicated by the sociologists and by the civil rights activists.
[03:22:00.701 --> 03:22:02.903]  He's gonna come back and call blacks jungle people.
[03:22:03.303 --> 03:22:04.184]  We'll get to that clip in a minute.
[03:22:04.224 --> 03:22:05.885]  Look at what a little slimy lawyer he is.
[03:22:05.925 --> 03:22:10.028]  But let's go back to Trump's about to... Notice Biden just gets endless times while I'm interrupting him.
[03:22:10.268 --> 03:22:11.308]  Here's Trump now responding.
[03:22:11.449 --> 03:22:15.785]   I've been on this side of the equation for the last Eight years.
[03:22:17.246 --> 03:22:19.108]  I've never seen anybody lie like this guy.
[03:22:19.568 --> 03:22:20.069]  He lies.
[03:22:20.169 --> 03:22:21.890]  I've never seen if he could look you in the face.
[03:22:23.151 --> 03:22:24.192]  So many other things, too.
[03:22:24.992 --> 03:22:26.233]  And we mentioned the laptop.
[03:22:26.273 --> 03:22:29.255]  We mentioned Russia, Russia, Russia, Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine.
[03:22:29.456 --> 03:22:31.037]  Everything he does is a lie.
[03:22:31.437 --> 03:22:33.819]  It's misinformation and disinformation.
[03:22:34.940 --> 03:22:38.903]  The losers and suckers story that he made up is a total lie on the military.
[03:22:39.423 --> 03:22:40.184]  It's a disgrace.
[03:22:40.764 --> 03:22:58.074]   But Social Security He's destroying it, because millions of people are pouring into our country, and they're putting them onto Social Security, they're putting them onto Medicare, Medicaid, they're putting them in our hospitals, they're taking the place of our citizens, what they're doing to the VA, to our veterans is unbelievable.
[03:22:58.094 --> 03:23:01.955]  Our veterans are living on the street, and these people are living in luxury hotels.
[03:23:02.595 --> 03:23:06.176]  He doesn't know what he's doing, and it's really coming back.
[03:23:06.336 --> 03:23:09.237]  I've never seen such anger in our country before.
[03:23:09.257 --> 03:23:10.497]  President Biden?
[03:23:11.084 --> 03:23:13.325]  The idea that veterans are not being taken care of.
[03:23:13.345 --> 03:23:15.146]  God, Biden just talked for three minutes.
[03:23:15.206 --> 03:23:16.926]  He's talking again.
[03:23:17.466 --> 03:23:19.967]  He acknowledged after that he fired that general.
[03:23:20.588 --> 03:23:25.009]  That general got fired because he's the one that acknowledged that that's what he said.
[03:23:25.069 --> 03:23:26.250]  He was the one standing with Trump.
[03:23:26.270 --> 03:23:27.550]  Back to the racial jungle video.
[03:23:27.570 --> 03:23:28.130]  Number one.
[03:23:28.210 --> 03:23:32.752]  Number two, the idea that we're going to be in a situation where... I come from that side of the track.
[03:23:33.502 --> 03:23:34.443]  That's where I'm from.
[03:23:34.463 --> 03:23:35.963]  I was a defense lawyer.
[03:23:36.103 --> 03:23:37.384]  I handle civil rights cases.
[03:23:37.444 --> 03:23:38.625]  I sat in on Route 40.
[03:23:38.665 --> 03:23:41.086]  I mean, you know, I'm not from the other side of this.
[03:23:42.166 --> 03:23:49.110]  And I happen to think that the one way to ensure that you set the civil rights movement in America further back is to continue to push busing.
[03:23:49.770 --> 03:23:51.251]  Because it's a bankrupt policy.
[03:23:53.564 --> 03:23:54.904]  That's why I think I'll be vindicated.
[03:23:55.004 --> 03:23:58.106]  I don't include myself with pro or anti-busing force.
[03:23:58.166 --> 03:24:04.629]  I think the only group that can determine whether or not a constitutional violation exists is the Federal Courts of the United States of America.
[03:24:05.029 --> 03:24:06.210]  No one else has that right.
[03:24:06.330 --> 03:24:25.384]   Secondly, a Federal Court of the United States of America determining a violation of the Constitution with regard to school desegregation cases must find that there is a specific intent to segregate before they can... Alright, we're going to go back to the urban jungle point about blacks, but let's go back to $5,000 a year per child.
[03:24:25.444 --> 03:24:30.427]  For many families, the cost of child care for two children is more than their rent.
[03:24:31.027 --> 03:24:34.509]  In your second term, what would you do to make child care more affordable?
[03:24:36.189 --> 03:24:39.651]  Just to go back, the general got fired because he was no good.
[03:24:40.271 --> 03:24:42.072]  And if he said that, that's why he made it up.
[03:24:42.112 --> 03:24:46.734]  But we have 19 people that said I didn't say it, and they're very highly respected, much more so than him.
[03:24:47.474 --> 03:24:50.616]  The other thing is, he doesn't fire people.
[03:24:51.516 --> 03:24:52.556]  He never fired people.
[03:24:52.776 --> 03:24:53.977]  I've never seen him fire anybody.
[03:24:54.037 --> 03:24:54.757]  I did fire a lot.
[03:24:54.777 --> 03:24:56.317]  I fired Comey because he was no good.
[03:24:56.357 --> 03:24:59.378]  I fired a lot of the top people at the FBI, drained the swamp.
[03:24:59.658 --> 03:25:00.339]  They were no good.
[03:25:00.719 --> 03:25:01.819]  Not easy to fire people.
[03:25:01.899 --> 03:25:03.940]  You'd pay a price for it, but they were no good.
[03:25:04.000 --> 03:25:05.000]  I inherited these people.
[03:25:05.020 --> 03:25:05.620]  I didn't put him there.
[03:25:05.640 --> 03:25:06.480]  I didn't put Comey there.
[03:25:06.520 --> 03:25:07.120]  He was no good.
[03:25:07.581 --> 03:25:08.401]  I fired him.
[03:25:08.421 --> 03:25:10.181]  This guy hasn't fired anybody.
[03:25:10.561 --> 03:25:11.162]  He never fires.
[03:25:11.862 --> 03:25:21.845]   He should have fired every military man that was involved with that Afghan The Afghanistan horror show, the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.
[03:25:22.745 --> 03:25:24.286]  He didn't fire, did you fire anybody?
[03:25:24.626 --> 03:25:29.370]  Did you fire anybody that's on the border that's allowed us to have the worst border in the history of the world?
[03:25:29.390 --> 03:25:36.835]  Did anybody get fired for allowing 18 million people, many from prisons, many from mental institutions?
[03:25:36.875 --> 03:25:39.937]  Did you fire anybody that allowed our country to be destroyed?
[03:25:40.652 --> 03:25:45.916]  Joe, our country is being destroyed as you and I sit up here and waste a lot of time on this debate.
[03:25:46.216 --> 03:25:47.237]  This shouldn't be a debate.
[03:25:47.738 --> 03:25:48.879]  He's the worst president.
[03:25:49.119 --> 03:25:50.680]  He just said it about me because I said it.
[03:25:51.701 --> 03:25:54.563]  But look, he's the worst president in the history of our country.
[03:25:54.843 --> 03:25:56.144]  He's destroyed our country.
[03:25:56.465 --> 03:25:58.706]  Now all of a sudden he's trying to get a little tough on the border.
[03:25:58.726 --> 03:26:03.330]  He came out with a nothing deal and it reduced it a little bit.
[03:26:03.770 --> 03:26:04.351]  A little bit.
[03:26:04.551 --> 03:26:05.412]  Like this much.
[03:26:05.552 --> 03:26:06.873]  It's insignificant.
[03:26:07.293 --> 03:26:08.434]  He wants open borders.
[03:26:08.794 --> 03:26:13.577]  He wants our country to either be destroyed or he wants to pick up those people as voters.
[03:26:14.458 --> 03:26:17.039]  And I don't think, we just can't let it happen.
[03:26:17.420 --> 03:26:24.724]  If he wins this election, our country doesn't have a chance, not even a chance, of coming out of this rut.
[03:26:25.145 --> 03:26:27.406]  We probably won't have a country left anymore.
[03:26:27.466 --> 03:26:28.287]  That's how bad it is.
[03:26:28.447 --> 03:26:30.448]  It's the worst in history by far.
[03:26:31.088 --> 03:26:31.769]  Thank you, President Trump.
[03:26:31.789 --> 03:26:32.309]  President Biden?
[03:26:32.509 --> 03:26:34.651]  We're the most admired country in the world.
[03:26:35.151 --> 03:26:36.772]  We're the United States of America.
[03:26:37.318 --> 03:26:38.519]  There's nothing beyond our control.
[03:26:38.539 --> 03:26:44.281]  The left badmouths America all day, says it's racist, says it's bad, that he plays a good cop.
[03:26:45.482 --> 03:26:47.222]  No one wants to screw around with us.
[03:26:47.362 --> 03:26:47.823]  Nobody.
[03:26:48.243 --> 03:26:48.723]  Number one.
[03:26:49.123 --> 03:26:52.625]  Number two, the idea that we're talking about worst presidents.
[03:26:52.965 --> 03:26:53.725]  I wasn't joking.
[03:26:54.085 --> 03:26:54.506]  Look it up.
[03:26:54.666 --> 03:26:55.326]  Go online.
[03:26:55.346 --> 03:27:00.928]  159 or 158, don't hold me to the exact number, presidential historians.
[03:27:01.228 --> 03:27:02.609]  They've had meetings and they voted.
[03:27:02.929 --> 03:27:05.991]  Oh, political whores that tell us the North Pole melted?
[03:27:06.171 --> 03:27:06.791]  Best to worst.
[03:27:07.225 --> 03:27:07.766]  That's a fact!
[03:27:08.586 --> 03:27:08.987]  Trump is bad!
[03:27:09.067 --> 03:27:09.947]  It's a fact!
[03:27:09.967 --> 03:27:12.910]  Joe Biden had sex with his daughter in the shower!
[03:27:12.970 --> 03:27:13.591]  It's a fact!
[03:27:13.411 --> 03:27:18.411]   It's a fact. Trump is bad. It's a fact. Joe Biden had sex with his daughter in the shower.
[03:27:18.411 --> 03:27:21.411]  It's a fact. But John Podesta is a pedophile.
[03:27:21.411 --> 03:27:25.411]  We should significantly increase the child care tax credit.
[03:27:25.411 --> 03:27:30.411]   We should significantly increase the availability of women and men.
[03:27:30.411 --> 03:27:33.411]   They hate the fact we're on air. They hate the fact we're exposing him.
[03:27:33.411 --> 03:27:36.411]  We're just starting to fight. We're winning. He's losing.
[03:27:36.411 --> 03:27:39.411]  He's a pedophile. He's a degenerate.
[03:27:39.411 --> 03:27:47.626]   would you do to make child care more affordable, Just so you understand, we have polling, we have other things, that they rate him the worst.
[03:27:48.066 --> 03:27:49.407]  Because what he's done is so bad.
[03:27:49.427 --> 03:27:52.370]  And they rate me, I'll show you, I will show you.
[03:27:52.430 --> 03:27:54.012]  And they rate me one of the best.
[03:27:54.652 --> 03:27:57.976]  And if I'm given another four years, I will be the best.
[03:27:58.036 --> 03:27:58.976]  I think I'll be the best.
[03:27:59.597 --> 03:28:02.545]   Nobody's ever Created an economy like us.
[03:28:02.625 --> 03:28:04.246]  Nobody ever cut taxes like us.
[03:28:04.806 --> 03:28:05.627]  He's the only one I know.
[03:28:05.647 --> 03:28:07.788]  He wants to raise your taxes by four times.
[03:28:07.829 --> 03:28:08.869]  He has sex with his daughter in the shower.
[03:28:08.889 --> 03:28:11.371]  He wants to raise everybody's taxes by four times.
[03:28:11.391 --> 03:28:12.352]  He has sex with his daughter in the shower.
[03:28:12.372 --> 03:28:13.512]  He wants to cut taxes.
[03:28:13.572 --> 03:28:14.253]  He's a good firm.
[03:28:14.273 --> 03:28:15.013]  They admit it's real.
[03:28:15.033 --> 03:28:16.194]  He rapes his daughter in the shower.
[03:28:16.254 --> 03:28:17.535]  He's a pedophile.
[03:28:17.735 --> 03:28:18.956]  He rapes his daughter.
[03:28:22.418 --> 03:28:23.799]  He rapes America.
[03:28:23.919 --> 03:28:26.421]  As I said, we did more business.
[03:28:26.621 --> 03:28:30.744]  Apple and all these companies, they were bringing money back into our country.
[03:28:31.590 --> 03:28:35.775]  The worst president in history by far, and everybody knows it.
[03:28:36.836 --> 03:28:40.460]  The truth of the matter is I rape my daughter every day in the shower.
[03:28:40.920 --> 03:28:44.965]  He will increase the taxes on middle class people.
[03:28:45.578 --> 03:28:47.680]  I said I'd never raise a tax on anybody unless they paid $1,000.
[03:28:47.740 --> 03:28:47.940]  I didn't.
[03:28:47.980 --> 03:28:48.780]  And I rate my daughter.
[03:28:48.800 --> 03:28:49.401]  I rate my daughter.
[03:28:51.882 --> 03:28:52.763]  I ship kids in for sex slavery.
[03:28:52.823 --> 03:28:53.183]  I'm a pedophile.
[03:28:53.223 --> 03:28:53.624]  I'm Joe Biden.
[03:28:53.443 --> 03:28:55.144]  You know what the economists say?
[03:28:55.144 --> 03:29:01.043]   That's going to cost the average American $2,500 a year more because you're going to
[03:29:01.043 --> 03:29:02.042]  have to pay the difference.
[03:29:02.042 --> 03:29:03.042]  I ship kids in for sex slavery.
[03:29:03.042 --> 03:29:04.042]  I'm a pedophile.
[03:29:04.042 --> 03:29:05.042]  I'm Joe Biden.
[03:29:05.042 --> 03:29:06.042]  And my son's a crackhead.
[03:29:06.042 --> 03:29:07.042]  He talks about how he somehow helped the middle class.
[03:29:07.042 --> 03:29:08.042]  The middle class has been devastated by you.
[03:29:08.042 --> 03:29:21.962]   Now you want a new tax cut of $5 trillion over the next 10 years, which is going to
[03:29:21.962 --> 03:29:23.683]  fundamentally bankrupt the country.
[03:29:23.683 --> 03:29:28.122]   You have the largest deficit in any president in American history, number one.
[03:29:28.122 --> 03:29:34.842]   Number two, you have not in fact made any progress with China.
[03:29:34.842 --> 03:29:42.403]   Unless we do something about that cadre of young people, tens of thousands of them, that
[03:29:42.429 --> 03:29:51.352]  Born out of wedlock, without parents, without supervision, without any structure, without any conscience developing.
[03:29:51.512 --> 03:29:54.073]  It did contribute to mass incarceration in our country.
[03:29:54.093 --> 03:30:00.415]  There's about a hundred thousand of them, if you want to be rhetorically extreme about it, who are the predators.
[03:30:00.536 --> 03:30:02.796]  They are beyond the pale, many of those people.
[03:30:02.876 --> 03:30:06.558]  We have no choice but to take them out of society.
[03:30:07.238 --> 03:30:13.097]   It's awful hard, as well, to get Latinx vaccinated as well.
[03:30:13.237 --> 03:30:13.517]  Why?
[03:30:14.398 --> 03:30:16.901]  They're worried that they'll be vaccinated and deported.
[03:30:17.161 --> 03:30:17.741]  Because I was 29.
[03:30:18.182 --> 03:30:20.364]  I'm like the token black or the token woman.
[03:30:20.404 --> 03:30:21.545]  I was the token young person.
[03:30:21.865 --> 03:30:25.949]  Even call centers was rushed overseas and hundreds of thousands.
[03:30:26.790 --> 03:30:28.031]  How many times you get the call?
[03:30:28.332 --> 03:30:31.983]   I'd like to talk to you about your But he hasn't done that.
[03:30:32.003 --> 03:30:39.205]  But he hasn't cut the tariffs because he can't, because it's too much money.
[03:30:39.045 --> 03:30:43.683]   you who most foreign policy experts around the world say is the best.
[03:30:43.683 --> 03:30:45.444]  But he hasn't done that.
[03:30:45.444 --> 03:30:49.284]   But he hasn't cut the tariffs because he can't, because it's too much money.
[03:30:49.284 --> 03:30:55.805]   But he's got the largest deficit in the history of our country, and he's got the worst situation
[03:30:56.750 --> 03:31:01.514]  China's going to own us if you keep allowing them to do what they're doing to us as a country.
[03:31:01.775 --> 03:31:05.358]  They are killing us as a country, Joe, and you can't let that happen.
[03:31:05.498 --> 03:31:06.739]  You're destroying our country.
[03:31:07.780 --> 03:31:10.182]  So, President Trump, you have 67 seconds left.
[03:31:10.202 --> 03:31:16.208]  The question was, what are you going to do to help Americans in the throes of addiction right now who are struggling to get the treatment they need?
[03:31:16.744 --> 03:31:19.827]  Take we're doing very well at addiction until the COVID came along.
[03:31:20.107 --> 03:31:25.392]  We had the two and a half almost three years of like nobody's ever had before any country in every way.
[03:31:26.172 --> 03:31:30.116]  And then we had to get tough and it was the drugs pouring across the border.
[03:31:30.862 --> 03:31:33.363]  We're, it started to increase.
[03:31:33.403 --> 03:31:34.603]  We got great equipment.
[03:31:34.643 --> 03:31:35.903]  We bought the certain dog.
[03:31:35.943 --> 03:31:39.484]  That's the most incredible thing that you've ever seen the way they can spot it.
[03:31:39.864 --> 03:31:44.546]  We did a lot and we had, we were getting very low numbers, very, very low numbers.
[03:31:44.886 --> 03:31:46.626]  Then he came along the numbers.
[03:31:46.766 --> 03:31:48.207]  Have you seen the numbers now?
[03:31:48.667 --> 03:32:00.170]  It's not only the 18 million people that I believe is even low because they, the gotaways, they don't even talk about gotaways, but the numbers of the amount of drugs and human trafficking in women.
[03:32:00.976 --> 03:32:02.417]  Coming across our border.
[03:32:02.657 --> 03:32:04.078]  The worst thing I've ever seen.
[03:32:04.998 --> 03:32:07.180]  At numbers that nobody's ever seen under him.
[03:32:09.241 --> 03:32:14.524]  But the number of drugs coming across our border now is the largest we've ever had by far.
[03:32:14.964 --> 03:32:15.724]  President Trump, thank you.
[03:32:15.744 --> 03:32:16.385]  President Biden?
[03:32:16.885 --> 03:32:20.367]  Fentanyl and byproducts of fentanyl went down for a while.
[03:32:20.567 --> 03:32:21.087]  That's a lie.
[03:32:21.127 --> 03:32:24.449]  And I wanted to make sure we use the machinery to detect fentanyl.
[03:32:24.809 --> 03:32:27.591]  These big machines that roll over everything that comes across the border.
[03:32:28.283 --> 03:32:29.244]  And it costs a lot of money.
[03:32:29.324 --> 03:32:30.324]  Roll over everything.
[03:32:30.344 --> 03:32:31.345]  Borders wide open.
[03:32:31.485 --> 03:32:32.766]  It's a bipartisan deal.
[03:32:33.266 --> 03:32:34.447]  More fentanyl machines.
[03:32:35.207 --> 03:32:37.689]  More fentanyl machines.
[03:32:37.809 --> 03:32:39.910]  More numbers of agents.
[03:32:39.990 --> 03:32:42.412]  More numbers of all the people at the border.
[03:32:43.032 --> 03:32:48.396]  And when we had that deal done, he called his Republican colleagues and said, don't do it.
[03:32:48.856 --> 03:32:49.436]  It's going to hurt me.
[03:32:49.517 --> 03:32:50.857]  No, it was an amnesty plan.
[03:32:50.877 --> 03:32:52.238]  He never argued it's not a good deal.
[03:32:52.258 --> 03:32:52.759]  You liar!
[03:32:52.779 --> 03:32:53.439]  It's a really good deal.
[03:32:54.261 --> 03:32:55.602]  We need those machines.
[03:32:55.982 --> 03:32:57.063]  We need those machines.
[03:32:57.483 --> 03:33:02.386]  And we're coming down very hard in every country in Asia in terms of precursors for fentanyl.
[03:33:02.767 --> 03:33:07.030]  And Mexico is working with us to make sure they don't have the technology to be able to put it together.
[03:33:07.590 --> 03:33:08.531]  That's what we have to do.
[03:33:08.551 --> 03:33:10.112]  We need those machines.
[03:33:10.612 --> 03:33:11.633]  Thank you, President Biden.
[03:33:11.653 --> 03:33:17.777]  President Trump, and again, the question is about Americans in the throes of addiction right now, struggling to get the treatment they need.
[03:33:18.477 --> 03:33:20.178]  This, because this does pertain to it.
[03:33:20.879 --> 03:33:22.340]  He ended Remain in Mexico.
[03:33:23.331 --> 03:33:24.591]  He ended catch-and-release.
[03:33:24.691 --> 03:33:27.492]  I made a catch-and-release in Mexico, not catch-and-release here.
[03:33:27.552 --> 03:33:28.592]  He totally opened the border!
[03:33:28.612 --> 03:33:30.232]  We had so many things that we had done.
[03:33:30.432 --> 03:33:32.133]  He said, if I win, I'm immediately surged.
[03:33:32.233 --> 03:33:33.313]  I got it all for nothing.
[03:33:33.913 --> 03:33:35.293]  It's just like when you have a hostage.
[03:33:35.313 --> 03:33:37.393]  We always pay $6 billion for a hostage.
[03:33:37.473 --> 03:33:38.754]  Every time we say there's a hostage.
[03:33:39.294 --> 03:33:41.654]  Now we have a hostage, a Wall Street Journal reporter.
[03:33:42.774 --> 03:33:43.834]  I think a good guy.
[03:33:43.854 --> 03:33:51.216]  And he's over there because Putin is laughing at this guy, probably asking for billions of dollars for the reporter.
[03:33:51.676 --> 03:33:52.596]  I will have him out.
[03:33:53.340 --> 03:34:02.463]  Very quickly, as soon as I take office, before I take office, I said, I literally, as soon as I win the election, I will have that reporter out.
[03:34:02.723 --> 03:34:09.246]  He should have had him out a long time ago, but Putin's probably asking for billions and billions of dollars because this guy pays it every time.
[03:34:09.686 --> 03:34:12.627]  We had two cases where we paid $6 billion for five people.
[03:34:13.427 --> 03:34:16.708]  I got 58 people out, and I paid essentially nothing.
[03:34:16.728 --> 03:34:18.409]  Thank you, President Trump.
[03:34:18.429 --> 03:34:18.609]  Dana?
[03:34:19.049 --> 03:34:21.910]  Let's turn to concerns that voters have about each of you.
[03:34:22.731 --> 03:34:27.035]  President Biden, you would be 86 at the end of your second term.
[03:34:27.055 --> 03:34:30.077]  Drugs now reporting, they're going to replace Biden as we told you three years ago.
[03:34:30.097 --> 03:34:34.761]  About your capability to handle the toughest job in the world well into your 80s.
[03:34:35.842 --> 03:34:42.989]  Well, first of all, I spent half my career being criticized as being the youngest person in politics.
[03:34:43.089 --> 03:34:46.251]  I was the second youngest person ever elected to the United States Senate.
[03:34:46.792 --> 03:34:47.673]  And now I'm the oldest.
[03:34:48.052 --> 03:34:51.012]  This guy's three years younger and a lot less competent.
[03:34:51.012 --> 03:34:53.372]   I think that just look at the record, look at what I've done.
[03:34:53.372 --> 03:34:56.492]  Look, I've turned around the horrible situation he left me.
[03:34:56.492 --> 03:35:02.372]   As I said, 50 million new jobs, 800,000 manufacturing jobs, more investment in America,
[03:35:02.372 --> 03:35:09.252]   over millions, billions of dollars in private investment in enterprises that we are growing.
[03:35:09.252 --> 03:35:14.333]   By the way, we brought off a lot of people on the whole idea of computer chips.
[03:35:14.303 --> 03:35:15.743]  We used to have 40% of the market.
[03:35:16.104 --> 03:35:24.388]  We invented those chips and we lost it because he was sending people to find the cheapest jobs overseas and to bring home a product.
[03:35:24.908 --> 03:35:26.929]  So I went to South Korea.
[03:35:27.369 --> 03:35:31.251]  I convinced Samsung to invest billions of dollars here in the United States.
[03:35:31.866 --> 03:35:33.106]  And guess what?
[03:35:33.546 --> 03:35:39.007]  Those fabs they call them, to build these ships, those fabs pay over $100,000.
[03:35:39.087 --> 03:35:41.828]  You don't need a college degree for them.
[03:35:42.248 --> 03:35:52.430]  And there's billions, about $40 billion already being invested and being built right now in the United States, creating significant jobs for Americans from all over the world.
[03:35:53.090 --> 03:35:55.131]  President Biden, you have 40 seconds left.
[03:35:55.171 --> 03:35:56.071]  Would you like to add anything?
[03:35:56.291 --> 03:35:56.891]  Yeah, I would.
[03:35:57.431 --> 03:36:04.165]   The idea that somehow we are this failing country, I've never heard a president talk like this before.
[03:36:04.965 --> 03:36:06.707]  We're the envy of the world.
[03:36:06.867 --> 03:36:14.794]  Name me a single major country president who wouldn't trade places with the United States of America for all our problems and all our opportunities.
[03:36:15.413 --> 03:36:17.955]  We're the most progressive country in the world in getting things done.
[03:36:18.436 --> 03:36:19.897]  We're the strongest country in the world.
[03:36:20.297 --> 03:36:29.286]  We're a country in the world who keeps our word and everybody trusts us, all of our allies and those who he coddles up to.
[03:36:29.666 --> 03:36:35.811]  All the left does is tell you America's bad all day long, but he plays good cop.
[03:36:36.392 --> 03:36:40.896]  Former President Trump, to follow up, you would be 82 at the end of your second term.
[03:36:41.397 --> 03:36:41.917]  What do you say?
[03:36:46.840 --> 03:36:49.761]  I just won two club championships, not even senior.
[03:36:49.781 --> 03:36:51.382]  Two regular club championships.
[03:36:51.201 --> 03:36:54.441]   He took none. I'd like to see him take one, just one, a real easy one.
[03:36:54.441 --> 03:36:57.001]  Like go through the first five questions. He couldn't do it.
[03:36:57.001 --> 03:37:01.322]   But I took two cognitive tests. I took physical exams every year.
[03:37:01.322 --> 03:37:06.361]   And you know, we knock on wood wherever we may have wood that I'm in very good
[03:37:06.361 --> 03:37:13.240]   health. I just won two club championships, not even senior, two regular club championships to do that. You have to be
[03:37:13.240 --> 03:37:13.841]  quite smart.
[03:37:13.927 --> 03:37:16.969]  You have to be able to hit the ball a long way, and I do it.
[03:37:17.170 --> 03:37:17.750]  He doesn't do it.
[03:37:17.770 --> 03:37:18.971]  He can't hit a ball 50 yards.
[03:37:19.011 --> 03:37:20.292]  He challenged me to a golf match.
[03:37:20.753 --> 03:37:21.994]  He can't hit a ball 50 yards.
[03:37:22.995 --> 03:37:24.216]  I think I'm in very good shape.
[03:37:24.296 --> 03:37:28.259]  I feel that I'm in as good a shape as I was 25, 30 years ago.
[03:37:28.299 --> 03:37:34.285]  Actually, I'm probably a little bit lighter, but I'm in as good a shape as I was years ago.
[03:37:34.365 --> 03:37:36.126]  I feel very good.
[03:37:36.567 --> 03:37:38.969]  I was willing to take a cognitive test, and you know what?
[03:37:39.009 --> 03:37:40.290]  If I didn't do well, I aced him.
[03:37:41.229 --> 03:37:47.053]  Dr. Ronny Jackson, who's a great guy when he was White House doctor.
[03:37:47.393 --> 03:37:50.155]  And both, one of them said they've never seen anybody ASIM.
[03:37:50.575 --> 03:37:50.955]  Thank you.
[03:37:51.556 --> 03:37:52.116]  President Biden.
[03:37:52.917 --> 03:37:58.781]  You can see he is six foot five and only 223 pounds or 20, 35 pounds.
[03:37:59.481 --> 03:38:03.203]  Well, you said six, four, 200.
[03:38:04.464 --> 03:38:07.386]  Just take a look at what he says he is and take a look at what he is.
[03:38:07.907 --> 03:38:10.048]  Look, I'd be happy to have a driving contest with him.
[03:38:10.555 --> 03:38:13.818]  Kareem, I got my handicap when I was Vice President.
[03:38:13.998 --> 03:38:15.139]  Good, let's see it!
[03:38:15.459 --> 03:38:21.404]  Play golf with Trump next week, you will, you will... Oh my God, this is so sick.
[03:38:22.445 --> 03:38:23.186]  You can do it?
[03:38:24.467 --> 03:38:26.749]  He's the 6th handicap of all.
[03:38:27.329 --> 03:38:28.571]  I was the 8th handicap?
[03:38:28.591 --> 03:38:29.551]  Yeah.
[03:38:30.552 --> 03:38:30.812]  8th?
[03:38:31.233 --> 03:38:33.935]  I've seen you swing, I know you swing.
[03:38:34.536 --> 03:38:35.837]  Let's not act like children.
[03:38:35.857 --> 03:38:38.399]  President Trump, we're going to... Let's not act like children.
[03:38:39.252 --> 03:38:42.473]  To a specific concern that voters have about you.
[03:38:43.333 --> 03:38:51.274]  Will you pledge tonight that once all legal challenges have been exhausted, that you will accept the results of this election?
[03:38:51.334 --> 03:38:53.055]  Will you let us steal the election again?
[03:38:53.215 --> 03:38:58.296]  And, you will say right now that political violence in any form is unacceptable.
[03:38:58.316 --> 03:38:59.816]  Oh, the left pushes political violence, hold on!
[03:38:59.836 --> 03:39:01.897]  I have to say that, but of course I believe that.
[03:39:02.237 --> 03:39:03.557]  It's totally unacceptable.
[03:39:04.324 --> 03:39:12.231]  And if you would see my statements that I made on Twitter at the time, and also my statement that I made in the Rose Garden, you would say it's one of the strongest statements you've ever seen.
[03:39:12.331 --> 03:39:19.317]  In addition to the speech I made, in front of, I believe, the largest crowd I've ever spoken to, and I will tell you, nobody ever talks about that.
[03:39:19.377 --> 03:39:25.883]  They talk about a relatively small number of people that went to the Capitol, and in many cases were ushered in by the police.
[03:39:26.284 --> 03:39:29.867]  And as Nancy Pelosi said, it was her responsibility, not mine.
[03:39:29.967 --> 03:39:31.148]  She said that loud and clear.
[03:39:31.758 --> 03:39:36.583]  But the answer is if the election is fair, free, and I want that more than anybody.
[03:39:37.104 --> 03:39:38.185]  And I'll tell you something.
[03:39:39.246 --> 03:39:42.029]  I wish he was a great president because I wouldn't be here right now.
[03:39:42.410 --> 03:39:45.974]  I'd be at one of my many places enjoying myself.
[03:39:46.254 --> 03:39:51.961]  I wouldn't be under indictment because I wouldn't have been his political opponent, you know, opponent because he indicted me.
[03:39:52.881 --> 03:39:53.962]  Because I was his opponent.
[03:39:54.002 --> 03:39:54.483]  That's beautiful.
[03:39:54.543 --> 03:39:56.024]  I wish he was a great president.
[03:39:56.045 --> 03:39:56.305]  So strong.
[03:39:56.445 --> 03:39:57.586]  I would rather have that.
[03:39:57.786 --> 03:39:58.027]  Yes.
[03:39:58.247 --> 03:39:58.988]  I wouldn't be here.
[03:39:59.388 --> 03:40:00.269]  I don't mind being here.
[03:40:00.549 --> 03:40:05.375]  The only reason I'm here is he's so bad as a president that I'm going to make America great again.
[03:40:05.395 --> 03:40:07.377]  We're going to make America great again.
[03:40:07.877 --> 03:40:09.359]  We're a failing nation right now.
[03:40:09.399 --> 03:40:11.021]  We're a seriously failing nation.
[03:40:11.604 --> 03:40:13.525]  And we're a failing nation because of him.
[03:40:13.925 --> 03:40:15.626]  His policies are so bad.
[03:40:16.606 --> 03:40:20.067]  His military policies are insane.
[03:40:20.327 --> 03:40:23.708]  Trump was winning before he just destroyed it right now.
[03:40:23.809 --> 03:40:25.449]  He will drive us into World War III.
[03:40:28.070 --> 03:40:29.451]  Then anybody can imagine.
[03:40:29.672 --> 03:40:31.793]  We are very, very close to World War 3.
[03:40:32.194 --> 03:40:33.374]  And he's driving us there.
[03:40:33.755 --> 03:40:40.040]  And Kim Jong-un and President Xi of China, Kim Jong-un of North Korea, all of these are Putin.
[03:40:40.380 --> 03:40:41.421]  They don't respect him.
[03:40:41.741 --> 03:40:42.722]  They don't fear him.
[03:40:43.102 --> 03:40:45.304]  They have nothing going with this gentleman.
[03:40:45.624 --> 03:40:47.786]  And he's going to drive us into World War 3.
[03:40:48.707 --> 03:40:48.987]  Boom!
[03:40:49.427 --> 03:40:50.768]  You want a World War 3?
[03:40:51.569 --> 03:40:55.232]  Let him follow and win and let Putin say, do what you want, NATO.
[03:40:55.712 --> 03:40:56.473]  Just do what you want.
[03:40:57.185 --> 03:40:58.166]  There's a thing called Article 5.
[03:40:58.446 --> 03:41:00.947]  An attack on one is an attack on all.
[03:41:01.307 --> 03:41:02.428]  A required response.
[03:41:02.508 --> 03:41:03.368]  What's your starting point?
[03:41:03.428 --> 03:41:03.809]  The idea.
[03:41:04.169 --> 03:41:04.829]  The idea.
[03:41:05.269 --> 03:41:11.453]  I can't think of a single major leader in the world who wouldn't trade places with the job I've done and what they've done.
[03:41:11.533 --> 03:41:12.333]  Oh, you're a piece of filth.
[03:41:12.393 --> 03:41:13.754]  You're a pedophile.
[03:41:14.074 --> 03:41:16.295]  We have wonderful peace because of the people, not me.
[03:41:16.315 --> 03:41:17.516]  It's because of the American people.
[03:41:17.876 --> 03:41:20.117]  They're capable of anything and they step up when they're needed.
[03:41:20.597 --> 03:41:23.059]  And right now... Biden just got destroyed.
[03:41:23.079 --> 03:41:25.480]  ...protect the world because our own safety is at stake.
[03:41:26.058 --> 03:41:30.060]  And again, you want to have a war, just let Putin go ahead and take you.
[03:41:30.140 --> 03:41:31.101]  Oh yeah, right.
[03:41:31.121 --> 03:41:34.583]  The West will attack Putin for 10 years.
[03:41:34.623 --> 03:41:35.523]  It's all on video.
[03:41:35.923 --> 03:41:36.964]  Soros bragging war.
[03:41:38.245 --> 03:41:47.049]  President Trump, as I come back to you for a follow-up, the question was, will you accept the results of this election regardless of who wins?
[03:41:47.850 --> 03:41:49.170]  Just to finish what he said.
[03:41:49.190 --> 03:41:51.051]  The Democrats challenge every election.
[03:41:51.152 --> 03:41:51.552]  Russia.
[03:41:51.732 --> 03:41:52.572]  See, they're going to steal it.
[03:41:52.592 --> 03:41:53.673]  Took a lot of land from Bush.
[03:41:54.491 --> 03:41:57.253]  They took a lot of land from Obama and Biden.
[03:41:58.293 --> 03:42:01.315]  They took no land, nothing from Trump, nothing.
[03:42:01.355 --> 03:42:02.375]  He knew not to do it.
[03:42:03.256 --> 03:42:04.396]  Not going to play games with me.
[03:42:04.436 --> 03:42:04.917]  He knew that.
[03:42:05.057 --> 03:42:07.458]  I got along with him very well, but he knew not to play games.
[03:42:07.898 --> 03:42:09.119]  He took nothing from me.
[03:42:10.480 --> 03:42:13.902]  But now he's going to take the whole thing from this man right here.
[03:42:14.742 --> 03:42:16.543]  That's a war that should have never started.
[03:42:16.583 --> 03:42:19.345]  It would have never started ever with me.
[03:42:20.265 --> 03:42:21.686]  And he's going to take Ukraine.
[03:42:22.683 --> 03:42:29.605]  And, you know, you asked me a question before, would you do this with... He's got us in such a bad position right now with Ukraine and Russia.
[03:42:30.405 --> 03:42:32.025]  Because Ukraine's not winning that war.
[03:42:32.545 --> 03:42:34.646]  He said, I will never settle until such time.
[03:42:35.046 --> 03:42:38.186]  They're running out of people, they're running out of soldiers, they've lost so many people.
[03:42:38.306 --> 03:42:39.107]  It's so sad.
[03:42:39.807 --> 03:42:48.369]  They've lost so many people, and they've lost those gorgeous cities with the golden domes that are a thousand years old, all because of him and stupid decisions.
[03:42:48.889 --> 03:42:50.229]  Russia would have never attacked.
[03:42:50.805 --> 03:42:56.366]  President Trump, the question was, will you accept the results of the election, regardless of who wins?
[03:42:56.426 --> 03:42:57.226]  Yes or no, please.
[03:42:57.886 --> 03:43:01.827]  If it's a fair and legal and good election, absolutely.
[03:43:02.227 --> 03:43:05.628]  I would have much rather accepted... The answer is Democrats challenge every election.
[03:43:05.808 --> 03:43:09.049]  The fraud and everything else was ridiculous.
[03:43:09.129 --> 03:43:11.489]  And if you want, we'll have a news conference on it in a week.
[03:43:11.609 --> 03:43:14.070]  Oh, they tried to censor all this before.
[03:43:14.370 --> 03:43:15.510]  They cannot stand this.
[03:43:15.550 --> 03:43:16.730]  Trump is dominating.
[03:43:16.770 --> 03:43:18.491]  There's nothing I'd rather do.
[03:43:18.571 --> 03:43:20.491]  It would be easier for me to do that.
[03:43:21.448 --> 03:43:23.109]  Then I'm running again.
[03:43:23.129 --> 03:43:27.491]  I wasn't really going to run until I saw the horrible job he did.
[03:43:27.531 --> 03:43:27.951]  He wasn't.
[03:43:27.991 --> 03:43:29.232]  He's destroying our country.
[03:43:29.572 --> 03:43:33.794]  I would be very happy to be someplace else in a nice location someplace.
[03:43:34.235 --> 03:43:39.998]  And again, no indictments, no political opponent stuff because it's the only way he thinks he can win.
[03:43:40.318 --> 03:43:46.061]  But unfortunately, it's driven up by numbers and driven up to a very high level because the people understand it.
[03:43:46.381 --> 03:43:46.641]  Yes.
[03:43:47.060 --> 03:43:49.860]  Let's see what your numbers are when this election is over.
[03:43:49.860 --> 03:43:50.500]  But you steal it.
[03:43:50.500 --> 03:43:52.540]  Let's see, you're a whiner.
[03:43:52.540 --> 03:43:56.060]   When you lost the first time, you continued, you appealed and
[03:43:56.060 --> 03:43:58.220]  appealed to courts all across the country.
[03:43:58.220 --> 03:44:01.739]   Not one single court in America- Never looked at any of this.
[03:44:01.739 --> 03:44:04.300]   Said any of your claims had any- Never looked at any evidence.
[03:44:04.300 --> 03:44:06.260]  State or local, none.
[03:44:06.260 --> 03:44:11.940]   But you continue to provoke this lie about some other- >> 20 points ahead in the real numbers.
[03:44:11.940 --> 03:44:13.779]  All this stealing.
[03:44:13.779 --> 03:44:16.181]  There's no evidence of that at all.
[03:44:16.181 --> 03:44:20.860]   And I tell you what, I doubt whether you'll accept it because it's the point.
[03:44:20.887 --> 03:44:24.249]  If you lose again and you're accepting anything, you can't stand the loss.
[03:44:24.289 --> 03:44:26.310]  Something snapped in you when you lost the last time.
[03:44:27.871 --> 03:44:33.754]  We'll be right back with more from the CNN Presidential Debate, live from Georgia.
[03:44:34.695 --> 03:44:37.457]  Okay, so they said this was going an hour and a half, right?
[03:44:37.477 --> 03:44:40.499]  So they- Yeah, they've done an hour and 25 minutes.
[03:44:40.318 --> 03:44:42.717]  Yeah, they've done an hour and 25 minutes.
[03:44:42.717 --> 03:44:46.398]  So they've done 85 minutes.
[03:44:46.510 --> 03:44:51.294]  This is supposedly about to end right now, but they're going to continue on.
[03:44:51.314 --> 03:44:53.616]  They've got a giant audience, something CNN never has.
[03:44:54.497 --> 03:45:00.923]  Let's go to Harrison Smith, Owen Schroer, and Chase Geiser with responses from both of them, all three of them.
[03:45:00.943 --> 03:45:01.784]  Let's go to Owen first.
[03:45:01.904 --> 03:45:02.084]  Owen?
[03:45:03.445 --> 03:45:07.529]  I'm anticipating CNN at least comes back for closing statements.
[03:45:08.190 --> 03:45:09.451]  I'm anticipating that.
[03:45:09.591 --> 03:45:11.413]  If they didn't, that would be a little strange.
[03:45:12.665 --> 03:45:18.990]  I mean, wow, I don't know what Biden did that would have helped him at all in an election.
[03:45:19.310 --> 03:45:26.815]  I really don't know anything he's done to strengthen his campaign or gain any undecided voters.
[03:45:27.235 --> 03:45:29.196]  I think this has been an outright slaughter by Trump.
[03:45:29.216 --> 03:45:37.442]  In fact, the top of Drudge Report right now says Biden debate disaster, Democrats looking to replace Joe Biden.
[03:45:37.842 --> 03:45:45.504]  Gavin Newsom was asked in the little waiting press room that they have there because they don't let anyone into the studio because it will confuse Joe Biden.
[03:45:45.744 --> 03:45:48.804]  Newsom was asked if he's ready to step in and replace Joe Biden.
[03:45:49.225 --> 03:45:50.505]  This has been an unmitigated disaster.
[03:45:50.525 --> 03:45:52.065]  They're calling it debate catastrophe.
[03:45:53.125 --> 03:45:55.966]  This has been an unmitigated disaster for Joe Biden.
[03:45:56.266 --> 03:46:00.707]  And so now the story, the story for Joe Biden has been, will he make it?
[03:46:01.127 --> 03:46:04.248]  Not his successes, not his accomplishments.
[03:46:05.317 --> 03:46:06.018]  Will he make it?
[03:46:06.278 --> 03:46:12.003]  When that's the number one story of your campaign for presidency, I think you're in a bad spot.
[03:46:12.383 --> 03:46:16.046]  And this only adds fuel to that flame and that speculation.
[03:46:16.066 --> 03:46:16.466]  I totally agree.
[03:46:16.486 --> 03:46:19.268]  Trump totally dominated this, despite them trying to rig it.
[03:46:20.629 --> 03:46:21.210]  This is insane.
[03:46:21.230 --> 03:46:23.071]  That's why Infowars is more important than ever.
[03:46:23.091 --> 03:46:26.494]  While they're trying to shut us down right now, let's go to Harrison Smith.
[03:46:27.375 --> 03:46:29.497]  Yeah, I mean, clearly he's totally dominating.
[03:46:30.499 --> 03:46:33.462]  Biden totally fumbled his strongest points.
[03:46:33.742 --> 03:46:37.646]  Things like abortion, whether you like it or not, that's his strongest point right now.
[03:46:37.686 --> 03:46:39.608]  That's what all the polls say.
[03:46:39.628 --> 03:46:41.991]  A lot of single issue voters rely on that.
[03:46:42.271 --> 03:46:44.433]  He totally fumbled, didn't make any good points there.
[03:46:45.454 --> 03:46:49.118]  The question about the black population, he completely fumbled, didn't make any good points there.
[03:46:49.338 --> 03:46:50.578]  So these are his strongest points.
[03:46:50.618 --> 03:46:51.918]  He totally failed on those.
[03:46:52.519 --> 03:46:59.400]  You know, I'm just sort of over the little, I mean, the quibbling about the golf was, uh, was kind of hilarious, but Biden's basically gotten every last word.
[03:46:59.420 --> 03:47:00.860]  By the way, Biden doesn't even play golf.
[03:47:00.920 --> 03:47:05.241]  Trump is literally routinely beats professional golfers, like at 78.
[03:47:05.321 --> 03:47:06.401]  I mean, it's just a fact.
[03:47:07.001 --> 03:47:07.841]  No, it's crazy.
[03:47:07.901 --> 03:47:10.442]  And I mean, Biden's face is like hypnotizing.
[03:47:10.482 --> 03:47:12.102]  I mean, there's something wrong with that.
[03:47:12.122 --> 03:47:13.002]  Old man face.
[03:47:13.462 --> 03:47:15.142]  It is, it is truly wild.
[03:47:15.342 --> 03:47:16.983]  And, uh, you know, I've been monitoring just Twitter.
[03:47:17.023 --> 03:47:18.483]  Yeah, look at Drudge with that face.
[03:47:19.218 --> 03:47:21.279]  Well, and look, it's not just Drudge saying this.
[03:47:21.460 --> 03:47:27.644]  People are posting screenshots in places like Reddit, other places that are leftist-dominated, and frankly, they're on suicide watch right now.
[03:47:27.664 --> 03:47:30.025]  I mean, literally, they're going, I need to re-up my passport.
[03:47:30.065 --> 03:47:30.605]  I might have to leave.
[03:47:30.645 --> 03:47:34.068]  I mean, everybody recognizes that Biden totally fumbled this.
[03:47:34.188 --> 03:47:40.232]  It's been a complete failure, and even people on the left are lamenting his performance today.
[03:47:40.292 --> 03:47:41.753]  So, a total blowout by Trump.
[03:47:41.793 --> 03:47:42.493]  Incredible stuff.
[03:47:44.210 --> 03:47:44.890]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:47:44.950 --> 03:47:50.913]  One of the things, Alex, that I totally agree with you on is that it's very obvious that CNN is giving Biden more time.
[03:47:50.953 --> 03:47:55.735]  But one thing that I did notice is that very rarely are they actually cutting off Trump.
[03:47:56.056 --> 03:48:05.060]  Trump is intentionally yielding time at the end of his responses because I think his strategy was to have Biden speak as much as possible.
[03:48:05.480 --> 03:48:14.387]   And when Biden recites his memorized response, He's asked a follow-up question in struggles or grasps at straws in order to fill the rest of his time.
[03:48:14.427 --> 03:48:16.710]  So while Biden can't fill his time... Chase, great points.
[03:48:16.730 --> 03:48:17.471]  They're back live.
[03:48:17.491 --> 03:48:18.392]  We'll come back to you in a moment.
[03:48:18.412 --> 03:48:19.172]  Here we go.
[03:48:19.193 --> 03:48:21.475]  We're gonna begin with you, President Biden.
[03:48:21.495 --> 03:48:22.276]  You have two minutes.
[03:48:25.640 --> 03:48:29.504]  We've made significant progress from the debacle that was left.
[03:48:30.154 --> 03:48:33.155]  By President Trump in his last term.
[03:48:33.275 --> 03:48:34.376]  Oh my God, he's running out of steam.
[03:48:34.436 --> 03:48:40.418]  We find ourselves in a situation where, number one, we have to be sure that we have access.
[03:48:40.718 --> 03:48:46.341]  I ask anyone out there in the audience, anyone watching this debate, do you think the tax system is fair?
[03:48:46.361 --> 03:48:48.601]  Move, bitch!
[03:48:48.822 --> 03:48:49.922]  Get out of the way!
[03:48:49.982 --> 03:48:51.002]  Get out of the way, bitch!
[03:48:51.042 --> 03:48:51.843]  Move out of the way!
[03:48:52.671 --> 03:49:01.659]  Increase in their taxes, but this guy has increased your taxes because of the deficit.
[03:49:01.679 --> 03:49:07.785]  Number one, he's increased inflation because of the debacle after when he handled the pandemic.
[03:49:08.366 --> 03:49:15.452]  And he finds himself in a position where he now wants to tax you more by putting a 10% tariff on everything that comes in the United States of America.
[03:49:16.434 --> 03:49:22.138]  I did when, for example, he wants to get away with... Well, that makes people buy American to do that.
[03:49:23.499 --> 03:49:26.341]  China has internal tariffs against us.
[03:49:26.402 --> 03:49:29.564]  The idea that tariffs are a tax on us?
[03:49:30.825 --> 03:49:31.585]  Well, guess what?
[03:49:32.006 --> 03:49:35.108]  We got it down to $35 for insulin instead of $400.
[03:49:35.067 --> 03:49:40.917]  excuse me $35 for insulin instead of $400 no more than $2,000.
[03:49:40.917 --> 03:49:41.947]  All he talks about is insulin.
[03:49:42.106 --> 03:49:44.828]  Insulin, insulin, insulin, insulin!
[03:49:44.868 --> 03:49:45.729]  The fentanyl death?
[03:49:45.749 --> 03:49:46.629]  Babbling moron!
[03:49:46.649 --> 03:49:47.030]  Let's go!
[03:49:46.869 --> 03:49:53.869]   That reduced the federal debt by $160 billion over 10 years because the government doesn't
[03:49:53.869 --> 03:49:54.869]  pay the government.
[03:49:54.869 --> 03:49:58.869]  I'm going to make that available to every single person.
[03:49:58.869 --> 03:50:01.869]  It's happening now.
[03:50:01.869 --> 03:50:04.869]  Everybody in America wants to get rid of that.
[03:50:04.869 --> 03:50:06.869]  We have to make sure that we have child care.
[03:50:06.869 --> 03:50:10.869]   We're going to significantly increase the credits people have for child care.
[03:50:11.090 --> 03:50:17.991]  I'm going to make sure we do something about what we're doing on lead pipes and all the things that are causing health problems.
[03:50:18.371 --> 03:50:19.852]  Let's go, Brandon!
[03:50:20.192 --> 03:50:22.552]  We're going to continue to fight to bring down inflation.
[03:50:22.592 --> 03:50:23.872]  Let's go, Brandon!
[03:50:24.473 --> 03:50:25.313]  Thank you, President Biden.
[03:50:25.353 --> 03:50:27.593]  President Trump, you now have two minutes for your closing statement.
[03:50:27.613 --> 03:50:28.613]  Thank you, President Brandon.
[03:50:28.753 --> 03:50:31.574]  Like so many politicians, this man is just a complainer.
[03:50:31.974 --> 03:50:35.735]  He said, we want to do this, we want to do that, we want to get rid of this tax, that tax.
[03:50:36.690 --> 03:50:37.711]  But he doesn't do anything.
[03:50:38.832 --> 03:50:43.818]  All he does is make our country unsafe by allowing millions and millions of people to pour in.
[03:50:44.379 --> 03:50:45.920]  Our military doesn't respect him.
[03:50:45.960 --> 03:50:47.802]  We look like fools in Afghanistan.
[03:50:48.503 --> 03:50:50.165]  We didn't stop Israel.
[03:50:50.185 --> 03:50:52.408]  It was such a horrible thing that would have never happened.
[03:50:52.448 --> 03:50:53.409]  It should have never happened.
[03:50:53.509 --> 03:50:54.470]  Iran was broke.
[03:50:54.930 --> 03:50:59.693]  Anybody that did business with Iran, including China, they couldn't do business with the United States.
[03:50:59.713 --> 03:51:00.493]  They all passed.
[03:51:00.693 --> 03:51:01.493]  Iran was broke.
[03:51:01.714 --> 03:51:04.595]  They had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah, for terror.
[03:51:04.635 --> 03:51:05.595]  No money whatsoever.
[03:51:06.156 --> 03:51:08.317]  Again, Ukraine should have never happened.
[03:51:08.837 --> 03:51:10.558]  He talks about all this stuff, but he didn't do it.
[03:51:10.578 --> 03:51:12.399]  For three and a half years, we're living in hell.
[03:51:12.981 --> 03:51:17.223]  We have the Palestinians and we have everybody else rioting all over the place.
[03:51:17.563 --> 03:51:22.345]  You talk about Charlottesville, this is a hundred times Charlottesville, a thousand times Charlottesville.
[03:51:22.365 --> 03:51:24.446]  The whole country is exploding because of you.
[03:51:24.906 --> 03:51:26.126]  Because they don't respect you.
[03:51:26.386 --> 03:51:28.067]  And they have to respect their president.
[03:51:28.347 --> 03:51:29.948]  And they don't respect you throughout the world.
[03:51:31.132 --> 03:51:32.513]  What we did was incredible.
[03:51:32.553 --> 03:51:34.293]  We rebuilt the military.
[03:51:34.373 --> 03:51:38.135]  We got the largest tax cut in history, the largest regulation cut in history.
[03:51:38.455 --> 03:51:46.818]  The reason he's got number one energy export regulations that gave jobs, but he's putting a lot of those regulations back on all of the things that we've done.
[03:51:46.898 --> 03:51:47.578]  Nobody's ever.
[03:51:48.038 --> 03:51:58.547]  I've never seen anything like, even from a medical standpoint, right to try, where we can try space-age materials instead of going to Asia or going to Europe and trying to get when you're terminally ill.
[03:51:58.968 --> 03:52:00.729]  Now you can go and you can get something.
[03:52:00.769 --> 03:52:01.830]  You sign a document.
[03:52:01.850 --> 03:52:04.373]  They've been trying to get it for 42 years.
[03:52:04.873 --> 03:52:18.912]   But you know what we did for the military was incredible choice for our soldiers, where our soldiers Instead of waiting for three months to see a doctor, can go out and get themselves fixed up, and readied up, and take care of themselves, and they're living.
[03:52:18.932 --> 03:52:25.053]  And that's why I had the highest approval rating in the history of the VA.
[03:52:25.233 --> 03:52:26.854]  But it's not going to be failing anymore.
[03:52:26.894 --> 03:52:28.034]  We're going to make it great again.
[03:52:28.054 --> 03:52:32.095]  Thank you, former President Trump, President Biden.
[03:52:32.875 --> 03:52:36.496]  Stay with us because we have full analysis of this debate.
[03:52:36.896 --> 03:52:38.776]  Anderson Cooper and Aaron Burnett starts.
[03:52:39.264 --> 03:52:40.245]  Now on CNN.
[03:52:40.285 --> 03:52:48.111]  All right, so Trump just totally dominated despite them giving Biden at least 12, 14 minutes.
[03:52:48.131 --> 03:52:49.152]  I was trying to write the numbers down.
[03:52:49.552 --> 03:52:50.813]  Over 10 minutes of extra time.
[03:52:51.954 --> 03:52:55.497]  As soon as Steven Crowder gets to the chair, I'm going to talk to him on his show.
[03:52:55.998 --> 03:52:56.958]  I'm looking at that right now.
[03:52:57.019 --> 03:53:00.301]  But let's go back to Chase Geiser got caught off by Trump coming back.
[03:53:00.922 --> 03:53:02.243]  Wow, that was domination.
[03:53:02.978 --> 03:53:03.439]  Absolutely.
[03:53:03.779 --> 03:53:11.366]  My last point before we went to the closing arguments was simply that Trump was intentionally yielding his time in many cases because he wanted Biden to speak more.
[03:53:11.386 --> 03:53:12.648]  It seems like that was his strategy.
[03:53:13.008 --> 03:53:16.972]  Biden failed to fill his time and was constantly asked follow-up questions.
[03:53:17.292 --> 03:53:20.135]  At one point, Dana Bash even said, is there anything more you would like to add?
[03:53:20.175 --> 03:53:22.117]  You have like 89 seconds left or something like that.
[03:53:22.137 --> 03:53:23.799]  And then he went on and grasped at straws.
[03:53:24.179 --> 03:53:26.880]  This was a disaster for Joe Biden, Alex.
[03:53:27.040 --> 03:53:29.681]  And I'm not just saying that because I'm a Trump supporter or I'm a right-winger or whatever.
[03:53:29.701 --> 03:53:30.181]  No, clearly.
[03:53:30.721 --> 03:53:32.221]  If Trump lost, I'd say it.
[03:53:32.581 --> 03:53:33.762]  This was a disaster.
[03:53:34.562 --> 03:53:35.102]  Disaster.
[03:53:37.023 --> 03:53:38.363]  Even Drudge says it's a disaster.
[03:53:38.383 --> 03:53:39.743]  He's a Democrat operative now.
[03:53:40.764 --> 03:53:41.364]  Harrison, Owen?
[03:53:42.134 --> 03:53:46.698]  Yeah, well, I'm just, again, just checking out what some of the leftists on Twitter are saying.
[03:53:46.818 --> 03:53:54.325]  Andrew Yang posts, guys, the Democrats should nominate someone else before it's too late, and the hashtag Swap Joe Out is now trending.
[03:53:54.625 --> 03:53:56.487]  He also said, look, I debated Joe seven times in 2020.
[03:53:56.747 --> 03:53:57.628]  He's a different guy in 2024.
[03:53:57.668 --> 03:54:00.351]  So they're in full panic mode.
[03:54:00.691 --> 03:54:02.873]  Full on panic across the board.
[03:54:03.033 --> 03:54:03.734]  It might have been the plan.
[03:54:03.754 --> 03:54:04.654]  It might have been the plan, but yeah, they are.
[03:54:06.676 --> 03:54:16.028]  Everybody's recognizing it now, and more people on Twitter are posting, you know, screenshots of people saying, you know, ooh, prominent leftists sending out texts saying, hey Gavin, we need you now.
[03:54:16.688 --> 03:54:18.671]  So they're ready to replace Joe after this.
[03:54:19.452 --> 03:54:23.857]  And Gavin Newsom, Biden's horrible, but Gavin Newsom is super unpopular.
[03:54:24.478 --> 03:54:24.938]  He's a creep.
[03:54:25.840 --> 03:54:26.020]  Owen?
[03:54:27.085 --> 03:54:28.846]  Well, the Democrats are in a real pinch.
[03:54:29.266 --> 03:54:34.428]  They have to nominate somebody before the end of July to get on the Ohio ballot.
[03:54:34.508 --> 03:54:40.630]  And right now, the plan was to do a virtual nomination to make sure that their candidate would be on the Ohio ballot.
[03:54:40.650 --> 03:54:51.074]  So, they either have to get the Ohio State Legislature to change their rules to get on the ballot, or they're going to have to make a move before their own convention.
[03:54:51.644 --> 03:54:54.928]  So I mean, this is just totally topsy-turvy if you're the Democrats.
[03:54:55.369 --> 03:54:58.012]  Look, I've got a whole sheet of notes here.
[03:54:58.092 --> 03:55:00.796]  I'm not going to spend too much time getting into all of it right now.
[03:55:00.996 --> 03:55:02.598]  I think we just lay out the basics.
[03:55:02.638 --> 03:55:03.899]  No, go through some of your notes here.
[03:55:04.140 --> 03:55:06.503]  As soon as Crowder comes in, I'll go blah, blah, blah, back to you.
[03:55:07.864 --> 03:55:08.966]  Well, millions of people...
[03:55:10.013 --> 03:55:11.814]  Who knows what the final TV ratings will be.
[03:55:11.874 --> 03:55:14.036]  This was streamed everywhere just on X alone.
[03:55:14.156 --> 03:55:20.940]  There were at least 10 million people watching this debate on all the different platforms on just X alone.
[03:55:21.200 --> 03:55:26.683]  So I can't even imagine the numbers on YouTube and Rumble and everywhere else where this was being streamed.
[03:55:27.383 --> 03:55:31.686]  But right out of the gates, Biden comes out and his voice is shot.
[03:55:32.532 --> 03:55:37.996]  It didn't take long for him to deteriorate in trying to get statements out of his mouth.
[03:55:38.336 --> 03:55:39.157]  He couldn't even talk.
[03:55:39.697 --> 03:55:41.338]  Trump was stable the whole time.
[03:55:41.358 --> 03:55:45.662]  I mean, look, I can sit here and I think I would say- Trump was very sly.
[03:55:46.282 --> 03:55:53.147]  Yeah, I would say through the entire 90 minutes or whatever it ended up being, Trump made maybe four mistakes the whole time.
[03:55:53.707 --> 03:55:57.110]  The entire Biden, every time he spoke, he made a mistake.
[03:55:57.699 --> 03:56:04.846]  He didn't have anything to offer the American people the entire time up there except a weak, quivering leader.
[03:56:05.166 --> 03:56:09.190]  And I would say Trump came off as the president in this debate.
[03:56:09.311 --> 03:56:11.653]  Biden came off as the quote-unquote contender.
[03:56:12.093 --> 03:56:15.196]  Biden came off as the guy who had to prove something.
[03:56:15.497 --> 03:56:17.459]  Trump came off like he was already the president.
[03:56:17.479 --> 03:56:19.040]  That was the aura that Trump had.
[03:56:19.360 --> 03:56:21.763]  Biden came off like he was trying to be the contender.
[03:56:22.973 --> 03:56:28.379]  I do agree that, and I said this earlier, I think Trump strategically let Biden have more time.
[03:56:28.419 --> 03:56:35.787]  Now, that may have been an agenda from Democrat operatives Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, but I think Trump gladly went along with it.
[03:56:36.248 --> 03:56:38.170]  He figured, hey, look, let Biden talk more.
[03:56:38.190 --> 03:56:39.351]  That's all it's going to hurt him and help me.
[03:56:39.371 --> 03:56:40.052]  So what happens now?
[03:56:40.593 --> 03:56:43.256]  I mean, they're going to try to bring in Big Mike or Gavin Newsom.
[03:56:44.491 --> 03:56:49.554]  Well, and that's why I'm saying they're in a pinch right now because they have very little time to make a decision.
[03:56:49.594 --> 03:56:52.716]  They basically have a month to decide what they're going to do.
[03:56:52.776 --> 03:56:56.038]  And now the calls for Biden to be replaced are just going to be amplified.
[03:56:56.718 --> 03:57:06.384]  And to go into an election with 130 days left and the number one story about your candidate, about your presumptive nominee, is he needs to be replaced?
[03:57:07.131 --> 03:57:08.411]  I don't know how they move forward with that.
[03:57:08.732 --> 03:57:12.653]  But even if they replace Joe Biden, here's the thing, this is a lose-lose situation.
[03:57:13.053 --> 03:57:14.693]  This is a total catastrophe.
[03:57:15.073 --> 03:57:17.394]  Replacing Joe Biden, it doesn't matter who they replace him with.
[03:57:17.814 --> 03:57:19.135]  That's a negative story.
[03:57:19.295 --> 03:57:25.817]  And again, he was already totally desperate and had to do this, thinking they hopped him up, blood doping, everything.
[03:57:26.277 --> 03:57:26.977]  It didn't work.
[03:57:26.997 --> 03:57:29.258]  I mean, they are in full panic mode.
[03:57:30.018 --> 03:57:33.379]  Look, look, look, look, sources, Dems saying we have a problem.
[03:57:33.739 --> 03:57:35.440]  That's Axelrod right now.
[03:57:35.480 --> 03:57:36.540]  Go to CNN, go to CNN.
[03:57:37.381 --> 03:57:40.043]  There are going to be discussions about whether he should continue.
[03:57:40.483 --> 03:57:44.966]  And I think part of it is Donald Trump did not meet his mission either.
[03:57:44.986 --> 03:58:01.057]  He could not resist the temptation to be nasty, to prevaricate about a whole bunch of things about his own record, about Biden's record, and to seem petty and small at times.
[03:58:01.097 --> 03:58:07.261]  So what you saw was a candidate who's deeply vulnerable and a president who may not be able to take advantage of.
[03:58:08.121 --> 03:58:17.487]  Listen, if anybody in America thinks that that was even close to being an okay debate by Joe Biden, I'm living in a parallel universe.
[03:58:18.367 --> 03:58:23.970]  That was an unmitigated disaster for President Biden from the second he walked out to the closing statement.
[03:58:24.290 --> 03:58:28.373]  The biggest issue for Democrats is abortion, and he couldn't give an answer.
[03:58:28.913 --> 03:58:32.495]  He gave an answer, he couldn't even give a coherent answer.
[03:58:33.095 --> 03:58:34.576]  Let's go back to Chase Geyser.
[03:58:34.596 --> 03:58:36.057]  They're totally turning on him right now.
[03:58:36.597 --> 03:58:49.245]  Yes, so what's interesting to me about this is if the Democrats really universally supported Joe Biden, every talking head, every pundit would be very careful and cautious and wary about how they respond to this.
[03:58:49.265 --> 03:58:54.788]  But since there's unilateral criticism of Biden implies to me that this was a setup for Biden.
[03:58:54.808 --> 03:58:58.350]  This was the plan the whole time to make Biden look like a disaster.
[03:58:58.370 --> 03:59:02.112]  And I know that Roger Stone thinks it's going to be big Mike and he's a brilliant man.
[03:59:02.132 --> 03:59:03.113]  He's right so many times.
[03:59:03.713 --> 03:59:09.355]  And I know that Owen earlier today made some very reasonable remarks as to why he doesn't think it's going to be Hillary Clinton.
[03:59:09.655 --> 03:59:13.156]  But I really think Hillary Clinton is going to replace Joe Biden here for a couple of reasons.
[03:59:13.256 --> 03:59:15.657]  By the way, they're even hyping that in the Washington Post.
[03:59:15.977 --> 03:59:17.038]  It's a comeback story.
[03:59:17.138 --> 03:59:19.618]  So it's a comeback story versus a public comeback story.
[03:59:19.919 --> 03:59:24.960]  Despite the fact that she's unpopular, she's done things like restart the Clinton Foundation in the name of rebuilding Ukraine.
[03:59:25.020 --> 03:59:26.801]  It's just weird that she's appearing out of nowhere.
[03:59:26.821 --> 03:59:28.441]  She's got a book that came out this week.
[03:59:28.842 --> 03:59:30.202]  I think it's going to be Hillary, guys.
[03:59:30.382 --> 03:59:31.162]  I could be nuts.
[03:59:31.282 --> 03:59:32.983]  No, no, I think they're definitely.
[03:59:33.243 --> 03:59:45.572]  I'm seeing Gavin Newsom being floated right now again.
[03:59:45.612 --> 03:59:52.257]  I'm just watching Twitter, watching the leftist feeds, and it's everybody throwing up the bat signal for Gavin Newsom.
[03:59:52.517 --> 03:59:55.819]  Whoever it is, the takeaway is it ain't gonna be Joe Biden.
[03:59:55.839 --> 03:59:57.581]  I think he really blew it on this one.
[03:59:58.021 --> 04:00:00.804]  The man looked gray just from that alone.
[04:00:00.824 --> 04:00:01.925]  He looks old.
[04:00:01.945 --> 04:00:04.828]  The whole time he's making these faces like he doesn't know where the hell he is.
[04:00:04.848 --> 04:00:10.234]  I mean, there wasn't any major gaffe to point to, but he hardly got through an answer without stumbling.
[04:00:11.015 --> 04:00:14.578]  I again say this is just an unmitigated success for Donald Trump.
[04:00:15.811 --> 04:00:25.859]  He smashed it across the board, and he especially did a good job tying things together like immigration and black unemployment, pointing out like, hey, immigration is the root of a lot of these issues that we're talking about.
[04:00:25.979 --> 04:00:37.769]  And Joe Biden can pander all he wants, but you know, when you look at 10 million, 18 million people crossing the border and taking jobs that would have probably gone mostly to black people, Trump just did a fantastic job.
[04:00:37.789 --> 04:00:51.601]   I really, I don't, you know, I think the Democrats are just They would lose their own credibility by backing up Joe Biden at this point and so they're all looking to a savior and it looks like Gavin Newsom is the top choice that I'm seeing on social media.
[04:00:52.522 --> 04:00:54.363]  That's what I'm saying, but they are floating Hillary.
[04:00:54.864 --> 04:00:55.084]  Yeah.
[04:00:55.665 --> 04:00:56.866]  And they definitely want Big Mike.
[04:00:56.986 --> 04:00:57.146]  Owen?
[04:00:58.268 --> 04:01:03.732]  I think the problem they have with bringing Hillary Clinton to the front is the narrative.
[04:01:04.012 --> 04:01:05.073]  How do you explain it?
[04:01:05.534 --> 04:01:08.216]  How do you explain leapfrogging Kamala Harris?
[04:01:08.676 --> 04:01:12.179]  And they might say, oh, well, it was stolen from Hillary.
[04:01:12.239 --> 04:01:13.380]  She legitimately won.
[04:01:13.460 --> 04:01:16.202]  Well, okay, so now you're an election denier?
[04:01:16.682 --> 04:01:20.445]  So I just see too many traps in the narrative for them to bring Hillary forward.
[04:01:20.485 --> 04:01:34.192]   Now, that doesn't mean they might not use Hillary as kind of a A leaping platform for whoever it is or say, oh, we'll bring in the great Hillary as a vice or maybe we bring her in as a state department again.
[04:01:34.212 --> 04:01:39.535]  But I would say this if they do put Clinton on there as the vice president.
[04:01:40.051 --> 04:01:52.520]  Whoever the president is should have double secret service, double private protection, quadruple check their food for poisoning, because you're really flirting with danger if you bring that up.
[04:01:52.540 --> 04:01:56.763]  I agree, but we're witnessing the death of the political establishment.
[04:02:00.719 --> 04:02:05.663]  This is an incredible moment.
[04:02:06.003 --> 04:02:09.365]  Trump, like a sly cat, was better than any other debate.
[04:02:09.425 --> 04:02:13.808]  He just sat there and was relaxed and destroyed Joe Biden.
[04:02:13.888 --> 04:02:15.069]  This was incredible.
[04:02:15.089 --> 04:02:16.069]  You know, I wrote that down.
[04:02:16.410 --> 04:02:18.551]  It looked like Donald Trump was preparing for a week.
[04:02:18.891 --> 04:02:20.532]  Joe Biden looked dazed and confused.
[04:02:21.093 --> 04:02:23.194]  Trump looks like he was the one that was prepared for a week.
[04:02:23.254 --> 04:02:28.998]  And he just did his normal routine, campaigning, legal issues, fundraising, and just showed up to the debate and knocked it out of the park.
[04:02:30.535 --> 04:02:33.359]  Well, Trump didn't know what he was up against eight years ago.
[04:02:33.779 --> 04:02:36.703]  He does now, and it's a totally different ballgame now.
[04:02:37.998 --> 04:02:42.581]  And he pointed out, you know, how successful he's been post the conviction.
[04:02:42.981 --> 04:02:45.842]  Just, you know, just shattering all of their narratives one after the other.
[04:02:45.862 --> 04:02:50.305]  And it's funny you call him a sly cat, Alex, because that was the insult Joe Biden used.
[04:02:50.405 --> 04:02:53.307]  It was like one of the only insults flung during this thing.
[04:02:53.327 --> 04:02:56.128]  And he called, he said, you have the attitude of an alley cat.
[04:02:56.228 --> 04:02:57.689]  It's like, that's cool.
[04:02:58.089 --> 04:03:00.090]  They like can't help but make Trump sound cool.
[04:03:00.591 --> 04:03:04.453]  Again, I just, I mean, this, this really fulfilled all my expectations coming into this.
[04:03:04.713 --> 04:03:05.954]  Yeah, there's a dredge headline.
[04:03:06.394 --> 04:03:08.836]  White House spends worst performance in history.
[04:03:09.396 --> 04:03:10.697]  Joe has a cold.
[04:03:11.217 --> 04:03:12.258]  Oh my god.
[04:03:12.278 --> 04:03:13.719]  I would have thought they would have said that earlier.
[04:03:13.739 --> 04:03:15.540]  Yeah, I'm sure he does have a cold.
[04:03:16.080 --> 04:03:16.520]  I'm sure.
[04:03:17.261 --> 04:03:17.901]  Vaccine didn't work.
[04:03:17.921 --> 04:03:19.182]  It's the middle of summer, guys.
[04:03:19.342 --> 04:03:19.802]  So, you know.
[04:03:19.843 --> 04:03:21.544]  Well, he left the shower on too long.
[04:03:21.584 --> 04:03:21.984]  It was dark.
[04:03:22.752 --> 04:03:25.034]  He ran out of hot water in the hot water.
[04:03:25.054 --> 04:03:26.035]  His daughter's a little old.
[04:03:26.075 --> 04:03:30.498]  But notice how CNN thought, no one can carry this as if they can control it.
[04:03:30.638 --> 04:03:35.501]  I mean, they have no power anymore, folks, other than starting World War III.
[04:03:35.902 --> 04:03:37.182]  And that's why we got to be serious.
[04:03:37.202 --> 04:03:38.283]  They're building FEMA camps.
[04:03:38.624 --> 04:03:39.824]  They're planning a race war.
[04:03:40.505 --> 04:03:45.308]  We can sit here and sit back, oh, we're winning, but the enemy's still got some tricks up their sleeves.
[04:03:45.709 --> 04:03:48.110]  Don't just think they've got a puppet Biden and we've already won this.
[04:03:48.931 --> 04:03:50.352]  Guys, talk about what you're worried about.
[04:03:54.687 --> 04:03:56.150]  Maybe some political violence?
[04:03:57.106 --> 04:03:58.666]  I'll make it clear.
[04:03:59.006 --> 04:04:00.327]  I'm worried about political violence.
[04:04:00.547 --> 04:04:01.887]  I'm worried about a cyber attack.
[04:04:01.987 --> 04:04:03.607]  I'm worried about a false flag.
[04:04:03.627 --> 04:04:11.649]  I think these are the top three cards they have to try to distract from whatever's going on with Joe and then maybe use that to replace Joe.
[04:04:11.769 --> 04:04:13.249]  I think those are their top three cards.
[04:04:13.669 --> 04:04:16.289]  Some form of political violence, a false flag.
[04:04:16.329 --> 04:04:16.589]  I agree.
[04:04:16.669 --> 04:04:20.730]  Couldn't they assassinate Biden to make them victims and then they bring it?
[04:04:20.830 --> 04:04:22.370]  Only way they win is assassinating Biden.
[04:04:22.770 --> 04:04:23.451]  And I don't want that.
[04:04:23.511 --> 04:04:24.231]  I'm totally against it.
[04:04:24.271 --> 04:04:26.151]  I'm saying that is in the calculus.
[04:04:27.702 --> 04:04:34.811]  Yeah, that would probably fall in the false flag category, should that happen, which would be god-awful for America to have a presidential assassination.
[04:04:34.831 --> 04:04:38.816]  Well, you know, I'm good at predicting stuff, but I'm just saying, if I was the enemy, that's what I'd do.
[04:04:40.037 --> 04:04:44.042]  Yeah, if I was Joe, I'd stay in hiding maybe for another 130 days.
[04:04:47.523 --> 04:04:55.010]  I think if I wanted to cause the most chaos, I would let Trump win and then pull something off, an assassination of some sort.
[04:04:55.230 --> 04:05:05.739]  You know, if you're going from the most chaos possible, I think that's the way you get both the Trump supporters and the, you know, Antifa squadrons both riled up and going after each other.
[04:05:05.759 --> 04:05:07.861]  And that's been my prediction for a little while.
[04:05:07.881 --> 04:05:08.742]  No, I agree.
[04:05:08.802 --> 04:05:13.826]  It's the 79 days of hell like we had four years ago when Trump was president-elect.
[04:05:13.866 --> 04:05:14.407]  What will they pull?
[04:05:15.862 --> 04:05:20.167]  Well, like I said, I think assassination is not off the table.
[04:05:20.187 --> 04:05:22.949]  I don't think they do it before the presidential race.
[04:05:22.990 --> 04:05:30.097]  But, you know, if you just think about these people who their job is to manipulate the consciousness of masses of people.
[04:05:30.377 --> 04:05:31.999]  You want to build up, build up, build up.
[04:05:31.958 --> 04:05:36.057]   have the Trump victory, everybody's celebrating, the left goes crazy because
[04:05:36.057 --> 04:05:39.677]   you know they've got their riot squads and they'll activate them and then at
[04:05:39.677 --> 04:05:43.018]   the height of that madness if you assassinate Trump then all the people
[04:05:43.018 --> 04:05:47.178]  who thought they'd won are suddenly you know feeling like...
[04:05:47.178 --> 04:05:49.177]  Or they kill Biden to make him the victim.
[04:05:49.177 --> 04:05:49.677]  Sorry?
[04:05:49.677 --> 04:05:51.677]  Or they kill Biden to make him the victim.
[04:05:51.677 --> 04:05:55.797]   Yeah well that's the other possibility is you know they've been
[04:05:55.797 --> 04:06:01.477]   building up the the straw man of white supremacist terror for a very long time.
[04:05:59.651 --> 04:06:00.512]  Yeah, I think they killed Biden.
[04:06:00.992 --> 04:06:05.195]  I'm going to get on record, I'm not saying it's going to happen, but I think that's definitely in their playbook.
[04:06:06.796 --> 04:06:08.517]  Yeah, I don't disagree.
[04:06:08.537 --> 04:06:09.638]  The problem is nobody would miss him.
[04:06:10.038 --> 04:06:16.242]  And I'm not trying to say that, you know, cruelly, but he's not loved like a Julius Caesar was loved or a Donald Trump or a JFK.
[04:06:16.282 --> 04:06:17.963]  If they assassinated him, everyone would be like, oh, thank God.
[04:06:20.900 --> 04:06:28.941]   I'm receiving messages from people that are monitoring the CNN post game and they're just
[04:06:28.941 --> 04:06:29.941]  ripping Biden.
[04:06:29.941 --> 04:06:33.659]  I mean, let's go to the live feed, CNN.
[04:06:33.659 --> 04:06:37.700]   Some talking point, they will wake up in the morning and they will do something else because
[04:06:37.700 --> 04:06:39.060]  this is not sustainable.
[04:06:39.060 --> 04:06:44.640]   That's another point about there are Democrats who are panicking and then there are a lot
[04:06:44.640 --> 04:06:49.460]   of Republicans who did not want to vote for Donald Trump, who do not want to vote for
[04:06:49.460 --> 04:06:52.260]  for Donald Trump, who are also panicking tonight.
[04:06:51.966 --> 04:06:55.867]  I heard from one who said, this is scary.
[04:06:56.328 --> 04:06:58.228]  That's how it was described to me.
[04:06:58.348 --> 04:07:00.109]  I'd second that.
[04:07:00.149 --> 04:07:10.072]  There were a lot of those feelings, not just from the base of the party, but other people who really think that there should be an alternative to Trump who they think is dangerous.
[04:07:11.345 --> 04:07:15.128]  That's the other part of what is unfolding tonight in terms of the panic that is out there.
[04:07:15.188 --> 04:07:17.951]  You already have coming into this debate.
[04:07:19.366 --> 04:07:21.067]  Support for third-party candidates.
[04:07:21.447 --> 04:07:23.048]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., highest.
[04:07:23.548 --> 04:07:25.929]  And then Jill Stein and Cornel West, nowhere near as close.
[04:07:25.949 --> 04:07:29.030]  But if you add it all up, you get into the teens in most states when you do that.
[04:07:29.490 --> 04:07:33.092]  I think one byproduct out of this is watch and see if those numbers go up a little bit.
[04:07:33.312 --> 04:07:45.017]  I'm not saying they're going to go up anywhere like a Perot standard, but you get to third-party candidates getting into double digits, then that really starts to twist your electoral map, depending on who they're drawing from state by state.
[04:07:45.037 --> 04:07:46.578]  This was already a very complicated race.
[04:07:47.738 --> 04:07:51.179]  Number one, the biggest complication right now is the conversation with the Democratic Party.
[04:07:51.459 --> 04:07:56.180]  But the other complication is going to be if Joe Biden stays put, and Kate's right, maybe there'll be another debate.
[04:07:56.300 --> 04:07:58.340]  I'm not sure Donald Trump's going to agree to a second debate.
[04:07:58.900 --> 04:07:59.840]  Biden's going to need it now.
[04:08:00.160 --> 04:08:02.901]  I'm not sure Trump's going to agree to it if the dynamics of the race change.
[04:08:02.981 --> 04:08:04.541]  I would also watch the third party.
[04:08:04.821 --> 04:08:08.762]  I just want to say one thing, especially to you two guys.
[04:08:09.982 --> 04:08:20.229]   If, for whatever reason, there's a change at the top of the ticket, You guys are in trouble with Donald Trump because the guy who was up there tonight.
[04:08:21.363 --> 04:08:25.486]  is not a guy who's going to inspire people.
[04:08:26.466 --> 04:08:35.171]  He did not show in any way that he has changed from the guy who people have a very positive opinion of for a lot of good reason.
[04:08:35.371 --> 04:08:39.054]  I think Donald Trump won several policy exchanges tonight.
[04:08:39.254 --> 04:08:40.654]  I think he did well on immigration.
[04:08:40.815 --> 04:08:42.295]  I think he did well on the economy.
[04:08:42.315 --> 04:08:44.317]  I think he did well on inflation.
[04:08:44.357 --> 04:08:46.538]  I think he went back to Afghanistan as he should have.
[04:08:47.038 --> 04:08:59.934]   The thing he did not do Was after he realized that he had Biden beaten on policy and on image, he should have turned the page and sounded an optimistic note about what we can become as a people and as a country.
[04:08:59.974 --> 04:09:00.694]  He did not do that.
[04:09:00.734 --> 04:09:02.895]  He continued to pummel Joe Biden all night.
[04:09:02.955 --> 04:09:10.679]  I understand what you're saying, but at the end of the night, very few things about the policy exchanges is going to be remembered.
[04:09:11.059 --> 04:09:14.000]  People are going to remember Joe Biden.
[04:09:14.240 --> 04:09:19.571]   They're going to remember him shuffling out They're gonna remember him staring blankly into the camera.
[04:09:20.011 --> 04:09:22.892]  They're gonna remember him looking down, losing his train of thought.
[04:09:23.312 --> 04:09:29.555]  And they're gonna remember that everything I thought I knew, but the White House told me don't believe my own eyes, is actually true.
[04:09:29.575 --> 04:09:30.675]  But that's not what I'm saying.
[04:09:30.695 --> 04:09:31.936]  What I said, Scott, was...
[04:09:32.725 --> 04:09:41.250]  If Joe Biden were not the candidate, if there was another candidate, I think Donald Trump would be in deep trouble.
[04:09:41.850 --> 04:09:43.551]  That is such a sad state of affairs.
[04:09:43.571 --> 04:09:48.795]  Something I was consistently hearing is what a bad debate in the sense that Donald Trump lied throughout.
[04:09:48.855 --> 04:09:49.775]  He misrepresented.
[04:09:49.875 --> 04:09:54.558]  He tried to turn away from key points that he should have given answers on and kept and kept deflecting.
[04:09:54.858 --> 04:09:59.179]  With any normal generic Democrat next to him, I don't think he would have won the night.
[04:09:59.499 --> 04:10:03.981]  But you put somebody who was suffering from the moment that they got out, it was hard to watch.
[04:10:04.061 --> 04:10:06.822]  I had to occasionally look away because it was so uncomfortable.
[04:10:07.262 --> 04:10:09.983]  I think America deserves better than the options that are in front of them.
[04:10:10.063 --> 04:10:11.103]  It's really devastating.
[04:10:11.143 --> 04:10:12.924]  And by the way, our allies are watching.
[04:10:13.004 --> 04:10:20.926]  Yeah, look, I mean, the way that I would try to phrase it, if I were less emotional, is Biden stuttered, but he told the truth.
[04:10:22.046 --> 04:10:22.787]  You look terrible.
[04:10:23.187 --> 04:10:23.967]  Those policies were good.
[04:10:24.784 --> 04:10:27.066]  Trump spoke plainly, but he lied the whole time.
[04:10:27.847 --> 04:10:29.788]  And he looked good, but his policies were terrible.
[04:10:30.129 --> 04:10:32.290]  I mean, he's going to do nothing on climate change.
[04:10:32.330 --> 04:10:34.072]  He was hugging the cactus on abortion.
[04:10:34.132 --> 04:10:35.833]  I mean, his policies are terrible.
[04:10:36.134 --> 04:10:43.760]  So you have somebody who probably shouldn't be president, and you have somebody who cannot be president in terms of what Donald Trump represents.
[04:10:44.521 --> 04:10:50.046]   So we have a problem as a country now, and this might be an opportunity for But young voters are up for grabs in this election.
[04:10:49.945 --> 04:10:54.505]   of those people right now are inspiring the confidence that they should inspire, that
[04:10:54.505 --> 04:10:57.505]   they can do the job in a way that would be good for the country.
[04:10:57.505 --> 04:11:00.066]  But young voters are up for grabs in this election.
[04:11:00.066 --> 04:11:04.245]   I don't know a voter under 30 who would have watched tonight and could say, "I have confidence
[04:11:04.245 --> 04:11:07.985]   in Joe Biden in casting my vote for four more years of Biden."
[04:11:07.985 --> 04:11:11.546]  And this opens the door, by the way, for the conversation.
[04:11:11.612 --> 04:11:17.493]  We're about to cut in with the great broadcaster, Steven Crowder, and their amazing operation in North Texas.
[04:11:18.134 --> 04:11:19.634]  Total bloodbath system.
[04:11:19.674 --> 04:11:20.994]  Totally turning against Biden.
[04:11:21.594 --> 04:11:23.935]  Roger Stone indicated they're about to remove Biden.
[04:11:24.375 --> 04:11:26.135]  This is totally insane.
[04:11:26.735 --> 04:11:28.216]  They're totally turning against him.
[04:11:28.256 --> 04:11:29.476]  I have no words to describe it.
[04:11:29.856 --> 04:11:30.776]  This was wild.
[04:11:31.376 --> 04:11:32.857]  Steven Crowder, thanks for having me on.
[04:11:32.897 --> 04:11:33.717]  Good to have you here with us.
[04:11:33.737 --> 04:11:34.257]  Steven Crowder.
[04:11:35.462 --> 04:11:35.902]  Absolutely.
[04:11:35.942 --> 04:11:41.206]  Mr. Jones, I know we're crossing the stream, so it got a little complicated, but hey, I'm glad to have you on, sir.
[04:11:41.466 --> 04:11:42.947]  We're watching CNN right now.
[04:11:43.707 --> 04:11:47.029]  Look, I was not quite there, but I am now 70-30.
[04:11:47.449 --> 04:11:51.151]  After tonight, they swapped Biden because even CNN is saying this was a bloodbath.
[04:11:51.792 --> 04:11:52.672]  What was your read?
[04:11:52.832 --> 04:11:59.116]  I'm sure you're having fun, but I also think people need to be careful because they are going to get dirtier and darker between now and election because of the loss.
[04:11:59.957 --> 04:12:00.957]  No, I totally agree.
[04:12:01.077 --> 04:12:03.739]  I mean, they gave at least 12 minutes more to Biden.
[04:12:04.474 --> 04:12:10.538]  They rigged all the questions for Biden, but like Gladiator, when they stab Maximus, he still wins the fight.
[04:12:10.638 --> 04:12:19.503]  I mean, Trump literally dominated, just being cool cat, and now they're bloodbathing on CNN and every other channel saying, get rid of him.
[04:12:19.843 --> 04:12:23.126]  But I agree, what are they going to pull next, and who is it they're about to bring in?
[04:12:23.486 --> 04:12:24.406]  Is it Gavin Newsom?
[04:12:25.087 --> 04:12:27.848]  Is it Hillary Clinton, which The Washington Post says they should bring in?
[04:12:28.269 --> 04:12:29.029]  Is it Big Mike?
[04:12:29.429 --> 04:12:31.150]  I mean, this is about to get a lot crazier.
[04:12:31.210 --> 04:12:33.492]  Will the deep state assassinate Biden?
[04:12:34.432 --> 04:12:35.933]  And say that Trump supporters did it.
[04:12:36.693 --> 04:12:39.695]  I'm wargaming this in my own mind, and that's what Alex Jones does.
[04:12:40.175 --> 04:12:43.056]  I'm saying, I think they might kill Biden and blame Trump.
[04:12:44.797 --> 04:12:45.297]  Uh, okay.
[04:12:45.657 --> 04:12:52.661]  I'll give that a... I'll give that a... I know, you and Nick are just... I give it a 2% chance because here's the thing.
[04:12:52.741 --> 04:12:56.463]  I just think it's easier to make him go away without... They want to avoid the theatrics.
[04:12:56.483 --> 04:12:57.683]  They want this to be as quiet as possible.
[04:12:57.703 --> 04:12:58.324]  But it makes him a victim.
[04:12:58.344 --> 04:13:00.204]  They want to... Okay, maybe you're right.
[04:13:00.244 --> 04:13:01.265]  But what do they do then, Steven?
[04:13:02.665 --> 04:13:05.387]  Well, I think they just point him south and hope for the best.
[04:13:05.467 --> 04:13:06.767]  This guy doesn't know where he is.
[04:13:06.787 --> 04:13:16.173]  I think that they want to do it quietly because, here's the thing, I think they want to parlay this, which is why they want to do it quietly, into their shenanigans that go into the election.
[04:13:16.213 --> 04:13:17.794]  They want it to take place in darkness.
[04:13:17.814 --> 04:13:21.436]  That's why CNN was threatening to remove any stream that fact-checked on tonight.
[04:13:21.936 --> 04:13:29.780]   Information is their enemy, and so I really do think If they have their choice, they want to do it quietly first, without drawing attention.
[04:13:29.800 --> 04:13:33.182]  Because they just made a big stink about taking democracy away from the American people.
[04:13:33.702 --> 04:13:35.223]  It's going to be really hard to have a leg to stand on.
[04:13:35.243 --> 04:13:35.443]  No, I agree.
[04:13:35.463 --> 04:13:36.684]  So they're going to remove him.
[04:13:36.744 --> 04:13:37.885]  Even Trump says remove him.
[04:13:38.205 --> 04:13:38.985]  So who is it?
[04:13:39.025 --> 04:13:40.506]  The big question is, who is it?
[04:13:41.829 --> 04:13:51.134]  Gosh, I don't, you know, the one that I fear most, I will say this, is Gretchen Whitmer, because she's evil, and because, obviously, I'm from the state of Michigan.
[04:13:51.554 --> 04:13:53.455]  I think Gavin Newsom has too much baggage.
[04:13:53.936 --> 04:13:55.036]  I know I've heard Hillary Clinton.
[04:13:55.176 --> 04:13:59.399]  Obviously, she's the only person who's more unlikable than Kamala Harris.
[04:13:59.439 --> 04:14:02.320]  The one thing we can all agree on is it will not be Kamala Harris, right?
[04:14:02.360 --> 04:14:02.900]  There's no way.
[04:14:03.121 --> 04:14:03.621]  No, you're right.
[04:14:03.661 --> 04:14:04.601]  I forgot about Whitmer.
[04:14:04.641 --> 04:14:05.502]  They've been floating her.
[04:14:06.792 --> 04:14:08.994]  Yeah, and she checks that box as a woman.
[04:14:09.034 --> 04:14:10.375]  Gavin Newsom kind of screwed the pooch.
[04:14:10.415 --> 04:14:13.457]  I think they sort of feel like that's spent and maybe trot him out next time.
[04:14:13.937 --> 04:14:16.099]  Who do you think they're going to replace him with?
[04:14:16.119 --> 04:14:18.480]  Because I think we all agree it's very likely that they do.
[04:14:18.901 --> 04:14:21.843]  They're floating Newsom, but California's a disaster, you're right.
[04:14:21.863 --> 04:14:27.086]  They've been slowly under the radar floating Whitmer of Michigan.
[04:14:27.887 --> 04:14:29.828]  So I think that's, I forgot about that.
[04:14:29.848 --> 04:14:30.869]  I think that's actually a good point.
[04:14:31.665 --> 04:14:32.506]  Uh, but they're crazy.
[04:14:32.606 --> 04:14:33.086]  I don't know.
[04:14:33.186 --> 04:14:34.768]  I mean, as if people are going to buy that.
[04:14:35.268 --> 04:14:36.409]  What are they going to do?
[04:14:36.489 --> 04:14:39.472]  Like, they kept saying, will you question the election this time, Trump?
[04:14:39.792 --> 04:14:43.195]  That seemed like four times because, well, everybody questions elections.
[04:14:43.235 --> 04:14:48.880]  The State Department says in election monitoring worldwide that if you can't question an election, it's not a free election.
[04:14:49.220 --> 04:14:51.322]  So since when can we not question an election?
[04:14:52.764 --> 04:15:01.370]  Well, here's the funny thing to me is Joe Biden was using, you know, last year's talking points, and so is CNN, because YouTube has changed their policy, right?
[04:15:01.630 --> 04:15:11.677]  Where you are now allowed to question election results, and I believe the reason for that is the same reason we had an election commission, election integrity commission, headed by Carter, Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, right?
[04:15:12.017 --> 04:15:16.240]  Because they're planning on questioning the election because they know that they can't win it honestly.
[04:15:16.280 --> 04:15:18.421]  So that's an actual change from YouTube policy.
[04:15:18.441 --> 04:15:18.821]  Exactly.
[04:15:18.841 --> 04:15:22.784]  They're having to back off from saying you can't question it because they're about to question it when Trump wins.
[04:15:24.025 --> 04:15:24.445]  Exactly.
[04:15:24.606 --> 04:15:29.870]  So they want to, I think CNN was wrong to throw that out because pretty soon you're going to see them questioning the election.
[04:15:31.651 --> 04:15:34.274]  It's a bizarre, it really is a bizarre time.
[04:15:34.294 --> 04:15:40.839]  I think that he lost in those first three questions when he had that freeze and it was so nonsensical.
[04:15:40.859 --> 04:15:47.525]  And where I think that he also lost was, I always say this, you know, I know that you did theater back in the day, acting away from the puck, right?
[04:15:47.545 --> 04:15:48.726]  Your face, your reactions.
[04:15:49.186 --> 04:15:51.325]   It was It was so genuine.
[04:15:51.325 --> 04:15:55.344]   Joe Biden was terrified and Donald Trump looked like, I got him.
[04:15:55.344 --> 04:15:57.825]  You could tell that he felt like he was about to nail it.
[04:15:57.825 --> 04:15:59.265]  And that's something you can't just fake.
[04:15:59.265 --> 04:16:00.984]  You can't prep for that in debate.
[04:16:00.984 --> 04:16:04.985]   The feeling that Trump seemed to display was that he was confident.
[04:16:04.985 --> 04:16:07.344]  Yeah, I don't think there's any doubt they've been routed.
[04:16:07.344 --> 04:16:10.065]  So we should all be asking how do they strike back?
[04:16:10.635 --> 04:16:11.075]  I think you're right.
[04:16:11.396 --> 04:16:12.017]  What do they do now?
[04:16:12.277 --> 04:16:14.401]  Yeah, I think you're right, and I think it's a multi-pronged approach.
[04:16:14.441 --> 04:16:18.588]  I think they first try and swap him out, and then I think that they pull every trick they can.
[04:16:18.628 --> 04:16:21.834]  I think we're going to see media suppression big time of stories.
[04:16:24.244 --> 04:16:29.687]  They're going to be running, they're going to be doing this in overdrive to make it seem as though it was something that couldn't be prevented.
[04:16:30.127 --> 04:16:35.430]  Because I think that it looks really bad for them if they swap him out and that is still a problem they're going to have to deal with.
[04:16:35.890 --> 04:16:39.252]  And I think they can only do that through spin and through information suppression.
[04:16:39.432 --> 04:16:41.253]  No, I agree, but I don't think there's any doubt now.
[04:16:41.313 --> 04:16:44.895]  I don't think there's any doubt they got to get rid of him now.
[04:16:45.235 --> 04:16:47.817]  But then that itself is changing horses in the middle of the stream.
[04:16:48.197 --> 04:16:50.238]  This is an unmitigated train wreck.
[04:16:50.819 --> 04:16:52.342]  Which makes it even more dangerous.
[04:16:52.502 --> 04:16:59.738]  So, all I can say is, anybody that claims we're not in exciting times, or anybody that claims things are boring, they must be dead.
[04:17:01.764 --> 04:17:11.130]  Here's something else I will say, you know, Donald Trump is winning the vote under 30, I believe by, he's like 60%.
[04:17:11.371 --> 04:17:16.114]  He's winning Latinos right now, 46 to 40, and he's gained a significant portion of the black vote.
[04:17:16.394 --> 04:17:28.262]  And people will say as a white guy, this is racist, but as someone who spends a lot of time around these folks, whether it's in comedy or friends and family, Hispanic Americans and black Americans, they do have an inherent respect for strength.
[04:17:28.722 --> 04:17:32.605]  And they do feel uncomfortable around incompetence and someone who isn't in control.
[04:17:32.965 --> 04:17:38.529]  And I actually expect, think about Arizona, think about Michigan, think about the states where Donald Trump is already winning.
[04:17:38.829 --> 04:17:40.570]  And these little margins make a huge difference.
[04:17:40.690 --> 04:17:44.693]  I expect Donald Trump to make big gains with the black community and Hispanic community.
[04:17:44.793 --> 04:17:46.154]  I have a dirty guinea next to me.
[04:17:46.194 --> 04:17:46.694]  What do you think?
[04:17:46.714 --> 04:17:47.415]  You're half Sicilian.
[04:17:48.716 --> 04:17:53.699]  Is there like a liberal, maybe CEO, a billionaire that we don't know about?
[04:17:54.324 --> 04:17:55.305]  That's their only chance.
[04:17:55.325 --> 04:17:56.606]  They could pull out of nowhere.
[04:17:56.786 --> 04:17:57.427]  Like Bezos?
[04:17:57.507 --> 04:17:58.128]  There's somebody.
[04:17:58.528 --> 04:17:59.229]  There's gotta be somebody.
[04:17:59.249 --> 04:18:02.912]  Oh, like a Bezos or somebody on that high profile.
[04:18:03.032 --> 04:18:03.913]  That's the only thing.
[04:18:04.434 --> 04:18:05.395]  That's their only shot.
[04:18:05.415 --> 04:18:06.796]  Is it Mark Cuban or somebody like that?
[04:18:06.836 --> 04:18:07.557]  Mark Cuban?
[04:18:07.597 --> 04:18:07.797]  Yeah.
[04:18:07.837 --> 04:18:08.638]  Somebody like that.
[04:18:08.778 --> 04:18:10.920]  Alex, I have a question for you on the timing.
[04:18:10.960 --> 04:18:17.002]   So I've been calling for a long time that Joe Biden wasn't going to Back to you, Bob.
[04:18:17.022 --> 04:18:17.603]  Sorry.
[04:18:17.723 --> 04:18:18.944]  I had a question on the timing.
[04:18:19.165 --> 04:18:22.669]  I've been saying this for a long time, and Nick agrees that Joe Biden's not going to be the guy.
[04:18:22.849 --> 04:18:25.693]  Do you think they wait until after the convention to do that?
[04:18:26.053 --> 04:18:27.635]  Colin, or do you think they do it before?
[04:18:27.655 --> 04:18:30.959]  I am not the master politico like Roger Stone.
[04:18:30.979 --> 04:18:32.160]  He's been saying it for three years.
[04:18:32.661 --> 04:18:34.163]  They'll replace him in Chicago.
[04:18:35.147 --> 04:18:36.688]  And so I think that's clear.
[04:18:36.788 --> 04:18:38.530]  You watch the bloodbath on CNN.
[04:18:38.830 --> 04:18:40.011]  They're all attacking him.
[04:18:40.031 --> 04:18:41.732]  The knives are out like he's Julius Caesar.
[04:18:42.653 --> 04:18:45.935]  So no, I mean, I think they replace him and say, Joe's got an illness.
[04:18:46.175 --> 04:18:47.516]  Remember, Joe said he was running.
[04:18:47.836 --> 04:18:49.898]  If I don't do a good job, I'll have an illness and disappear.
[04:18:50.338 --> 04:18:51.719]  So I think that was always kind of the plan.
[04:18:51.759 --> 04:18:53.520]  He's the third administration of Obama.
[04:18:54.121 --> 04:19:00.985]  And so I think I think I'm predicting you will see him step down at the DNC of Chicago in July.
[04:19:02.655 --> 04:19:05.126]  Let me make a statement here, okay?
[04:19:05.166 --> 04:19:05.849]  If that happens...
[04:19:06.976 --> 04:19:09.057]  I've said this before in the past, Mr. Jones.
[04:19:09.137 --> 04:19:09.737]  I've said, you know what?
[04:19:10.217 --> 04:19:24.320]  I feel like Alex and I have come closer together because Alex has really sort of espoused Christian conservatism more now, and I actually go, oh geez, Alex was right about a lot, you know, whereas if you were to ask me 10 years ago, like, that's conspiratorial!
[04:19:24.980 --> 04:19:36.632]   If they replace him, the last vestiges of my faith in the American political system, as it relates to certainly the left, where I think there at least is some sense of decorum Will be gone.
[04:19:36.812 --> 04:19:42.873]  Honestly, I will probably be further to the right than you because I maintain like, hey, you know what?
[04:19:43.013 --> 04:19:46.754]  I still think he's going to be the guy and I will be eating some crow.
[04:19:46.814 --> 04:19:52.095]  I'll be eating some humble pie because I thought they had to stick with Biden because they still had to maintain the appearance of it.
[04:19:52.415 --> 04:19:58.276]  If they swap him out, that means they genuinely do not care about the will of the American people and I will admit it.
[04:19:58.556 --> 04:20:01.057]  Well, Steven, I don't think you're wrong probably.
[04:20:01.989 --> 04:20:05.391]  I mean, when Roger three years ago said they will replace him, I was like, yeah, right.
[04:20:05.951 --> 04:20:08.052]  It's just, I saw them totally turn against him tonight.
[04:20:08.832 --> 04:20:11.473]  And, but it is crazy to replace him.
[04:20:11.874 --> 04:20:12.694]  It's even more desperate.
[04:20:12.734 --> 04:20:13.754]  So I'd say 50-50.
[04:20:13.774 --> 04:20:15.555]  I'm not trying to like hedge my bets.
[04:20:15.935 --> 04:20:17.276]  I literally don't know what's going to happen.
[04:20:17.716 --> 04:20:19.277]  I just know they are bleeding out.
[04:20:19.677 --> 04:20:20.898]  They are exploding.
[04:20:21.838 --> 04:20:22.718]  It's like a race car.
[04:20:22.878 --> 04:20:25.520]  Its engine blows up and fire shoots out and it blows up.
[04:20:25.600 --> 04:20:27.240]  I mean, I, they just blew up.
[04:20:27.761 --> 04:20:28.981]  So I don't know what they're going to do.
[04:20:29.081 --> 04:20:30.562]  So the question is, what are they going to do?
[04:20:32.660 --> 04:20:34.782]  I don't know what they will do as far as how they replace him.
[04:20:34.942 --> 04:20:42.770]  I do know that it's going to get dirtier, it's going to get worse, it's going to get really rough between now and election, because they are not going to give this one up.
[04:20:42.931 --> 04:20:51.720]  They've taken every legal avenue and illegal avenue to try and prevent... Oh, Maxine Waters is on the news every day saying Trump supporters are trading the woods to kill black people.
[04:20:52.140 --> 04:20:57.045]   Now, look, What conservatives are really trading in the woods to kill black people?
[04:20:57.385 --> 04:21:06.208]  No, I believe from just what they're saying, they're trying to provocateur lunatics, like with the Whitmer kidnapping, but much worse, to stage something.
[04:21:06.248 --> 04:21:07.428]  I think that's very clear.
[04:21:07.848 --> 04:21:09.749]  That's their saving grace.
[04:21:09.829 --> 04:21:10.869]  That's their due sex.
[04:21:11.369 --> 04:21:12.750]  That's their secret plan.
[04:21:12.770 --> 04:21:13.870]  That's their October surprise.
[04:21:14.370 --> 04:21:20.252]  I'm saying right now, from what I've seen, they're planning to provocateur lunatics to go shoot up black churches.
[04:21:21.522 --> 04:21:22.143]  Yeah, but you know what?
[04:21:22.504 --> 04:21:28.933]  Even the lunatics right now, if anyone was thinking about assassinating Joe Biden after tonight, the lunatics are saying, Hold!
[04:21:29.434 --> 04:21:29.934]  Wait!
[04:21:30.355 --> 04:21:30.936]  They know.
[04:21:30.956 --> 04:21:31.597]  I agree.
[04:21:32.483 --> 04:21:38.408]  Because people are aware of false flags and aware of being provocateur from Jan 6 and the Whitmer kidnapping plan.
[04:21:38.528 --> 04:21:39.008]  I agree.
[04:21:39.408 --> 04:21:40.669]  Like the Whitmer, people don't know.
[04:21:40.689 --> 04:21:44.252]  There was three trials that were found guilty in the third trial, but the two trials they weren't.
[04:21:44.732 --> 04:21:53.119]  And it turned out the majority were FBI leaders getting potheads, giving them money to just say you're going to go kidnap the governor.
[04:21:53.739 --> 04:21:59.944]  And so yeah, people now know when they're like a pothead, some guy offers you $10,000 to say they're going to kill Biden.
[04:21:59.984 --> 04:22:01.065]  They're like, you're a fed.
[04:22:01.770 --> 04:22:06.452]  So I think because there's that awareness, they're losing that power because we're not as naive as we were.
[04:22:07.672 --> 04:22:08.172]  I think you're right.
[04:22:08.212 --> 04:22:11.674]  And so everyone here, including you, Alex, everyone here, let's all make a pact on air.
[04:22:12.374 --> 04:22:13.895]  No more kidnapping governors.
[04:22:13.975 --> 04:22:14.695]  That's right.
[04:22:14.715 --> 04:22:15.715]  Back to my question.
[04:22:15.815 --> 04:22:16.476]  It just depends.
[04:22:16.696 --> 04:22:17.716]  That was ignored.
[04:22:17.856 --> 04:22:18.316]  I'm sorry.
[04:22:18.376 --> 04:22:19.337]  It wasn't ignored.
[04:22:19.357 --> 04:22:20.097]  It was overshadowed.
[04:22:20.757 --> 04:22:20.877]  Okay.
[04:22:20.897 --> 04:22:21.698]  It was overshadowed.
[04:22:23.809 --> 04:22:31.132]  Don't you think, Alex, how about a Bezos or a Mark Cuban, kind of a high profile business guy who leans left?
[04:22:31.312 --> 04:22:33.113]  Isn't that their only legitimate shot?
[04:22:33.554 --> 04:22:34.914]  I think that's really a smart point.
[04:22:34.954 --> 04:22:40.437]  I hadn't thought of that, but now that you say it, I think, yeah, they might bring in a Bloomberg or a Mark Cuban.
[04:22:40.557 --> 04:22:41.137]  Absolutely.
[04:22:41.177 --> 04:22:42.858]  I mean, they're going to they're going to pull something.
[04:22:42.878 --> 04:22:44.679]  I don't think any of it's going to work.
[04:22:44.759 --> 04:22:49.581]  So we are about the next 130 days to be the most exciting time alive.
[04:22:49.681 --> 04:22:51.882]  So it's an amazing time to be alive.
[04:22:52.884 --> 04:22:53.104]  Yeah.
[04:22:53.224 --> 04:22:54.405]  No, I agree with you there.
[04:22:54.605 --> 04:23:00.989]  And I think it's also, as people who do what we do, one of the most dangerous times to do what we do.
[04:23:01.089 --> 04:23:05.452]  Because tonight, CNN started saying they're going to remove any live facts.
[04:23:05.592 --> 04:23:08.073]  I bet you they're going to stop that because they know it's a disaster.
[04:23:08.373 --> 04:23:09.534]  They want to keep their powder dry.
[04:23:10.214 --> 04:23:12.676]  By the way, just to interrupt you, that shows how desperate they are.
[04:23:12.716 --> 04:23:12.856]  Yeah.
[04:23:13.196 --> 04:23:17.099]  Three days ago, they sent notices out to everybody saying, you can't cover it.
[04:23:17.399 --> 04:23:18.439]  You can't show clips.
[04:23:18.980 --> 04:23:19.560]  Fair use.
[04:23:19.640 --> 04:23:20.781]  Elon Musk said screw you.
[04:23:21.685 --> 04:23:22.246]  Exactly.
[04:23:22.426 --> 04:23:23.568]  It's fair use, folks.
[04:23:23.648 --> 04:23:27.172]  Political speech is the most open speech for commentary.
[04:23:27.533 --> 04:23:27.673]  It's 100%.
[04:23:28.333 --> 04:23:28.894]  Exactly.
[04:23:29.375 --> 04:23:37.605]  So I interrupt you, Stephen, but yeah, what are they going to do with their attempt to try to tell us we can't respond to that train wreck?
[04:23:38.982 --> 04:23:39.602]  Well, here's what they do.
[04:23:39.622 --> 04:23:42.764]  They make it really clear, Alex, is that first they demonetize you.
[04:23:42.784 --> 04:23:44.765]  That's what happened with us where they say, you can't make any money.
[04:23:44.845 --> 04:23:46.206]  And we say, okay, we'll take that on the chin.
[04:23:46.526 --> 04:23:47.787]  Then they say, we're going to shadow ban you.
[04:23:47.807 --> 04:23:48.647]  We're going to throttle you.
[04:23:49.027 --> 04:23:55.811]  And then when you create an alternative platform, for example, we've done with Mug Club and Rumble, they say, well, we're just going to sue you and go after you legally.
[04:23:57.333 --> 04:24:03.733]   by the way, and I do mean a political persecution, to try and prevent you from making a living at all.
[04:24:03.733 --> 04:24:08.533]   That's the order, demonetize, if it's not enough, de-platform, you have another platform,
[04:24:08.533 --> 04:24:13.712]   remove that platform through legal avenues to ensure you can't make a living ever again.
[04:24:13.712 --> 04:24:17.793]   Just imagine if someone came into your farm and said, "I'm taking your crops away from you."
[04:24:17.793 --> 04:24:21.253]   That's what's really happening, it's just a digital version of that.
[04:24:21.253 --> 04:24:24.692]   I agree, but it's a sign of their weakness, and as long as we don't bow down or back down,
[04:24:24.692 --> 04:24:25.692]  we're gonna win.
[04:24:25.692 --> 04:24:30.453]   Which is another question, Trump gets in, we gotta make sure he doesn't put a bunch of jerks in.
[04:24:30.473 --> 04:24:31.693]  He's not perfect.
[04:24:31.994 --> 04:24:34.596]  He believes in politicos.
[04:24:34.896 --> 04:24:35.997]  Let's war game this real quick.
[04:24:36.677 --> 04:24:38.178]  Trump wins in 130 days.
[04:24:38.378 --> 04:24:43.182]  What does the deep state do in that 79 days before he's inaugurated January 20th?
[04:24:43.502 --> 04:24:46.665]  And then once Trump gets in, how do we then hold his feet to the fire?
[04:24:48.826 --> 04:24:50.828]  Well, you know, like you said, you're not a politico.
[04:24:52.486 --> 04:24:53.807]  I'm really concerned about the media.
[04:24:53.887 --> 04:24:58.309]  I'm really concerned about the entertainment industry, where they're going to try and change public opinion and warp everything he says.
[04:24:58.349 --> 04:25:05.372]  So we're going to see a lot more of him saying, you know, I'm not talking about neo-Nazis, white supremacists who I condemn totally, and them say fine people on both sides.
[04:25:05.672 --> 04:25:11.134]  When he says make your voices heard peacefully and patriotically, then they say he called people to violence on January 6th.
[04:25:11.214 --> 04:25:24.481]   And the reason that I focus on that is because those are the top, people don't realize this, It was the media's false talking points that Kinzinger and Cheney knew were wrong that allowed them to withhold evidence and imprison Americans.
[04:25:24.881 --> 04:25:26.743]  So if we... No, they're going to lie even worse.
[04:25:26.783 --> 04:25:27.123]  Exactly.
[04:25:27.143 --> 04:25:34.747]  Like a week ago, MSNBC puts out an undercover Roger Stone video a month ago where he goes, if they steal the election, we're going to challenge it.
[04:25:35.048 --> 04:25:38.029]  And the headline is, Roger Stone launches plan to steal election.
[04:25:38.430 --> 04:25:42.312]  They even, they show the truth, but the headline is totally different.
[04:25:44.461 --> 04:25:47.406]  I think the only difference this time is the people are aware.
[04:25:47.466 --> 04:25:48.689]  Trump has his record now.
[04:25:49.069 --> 04:25:52.095]  The people are especially after what Alvin Bragg tried to pull.
[04:25:52.762 --> 04:25:54.682]  And it backfired in their face.
[04:25:55.063 --> 04:25:59.784]  So I think any more shenanigans on their part is just going to backfire even more.
[04:25:59.824 --> 04:26:02.684]  But that's why they need the media and the entertainment industry.
[04:26:02.724 --> 04:26:07.465]  The deep state is testicle-less without the media.
[04:26:07.605 --> 04:26:09.366]  But I'm saying people see through the media now.
[04:26:10.146 --> 04:26:12.226]  Well, they do, but then you see CNN.
[04:26:12.286 --> 04:26:12.847]  Here's what happens.
[04:26:12.887 --> 04:26:13.607]  Here's the problem, right?
[04:26:13.627 --> 04:26:14.367]  And Alex, you know this.
[04:26:15.448 --> 04:26:33.960]  CNN, News Corp, whoever it is, Turner, they go at ABC, when you talk about NBC, Universal, ABC, Disney, they spend a bunch of money in advertising on YouTube, Facebook, they don't really have a control over X anymore, to then dictate policy and say we don't have a stranglehold, so we're simply going to silence everyone else.
[04:26:34.000 --> 04:26:39.084]  Yeah, we're dominating news, but only 10% of people watch news.
[04:26:39.124 --> 04:26:43.367]  You're right, Steven, it's the movies, entertainment, where they're going to put the lies on.
[04:26:45.180 --> 04:26:48.343]  Yeah, and they have to, and then you'll have poli- I mean, you know this, right?
[04:26:48.824 --> 04:26:51.146]  I've had- I've had to be in depositions, right?
[04:26:51.406 --> 04:26:57.953]  There are trials that take place where the evidence listed is a quote from a news article, and it's taken as though it's authoritative.
[04:26:57.973 --> 04:26:59.474]  These people work hand-in-hand.
[04:26:59.814 --> 04:27:01.096]  It's what they did with Donald Trump.
[04:27:01.116 --> 04:27:01.656]  Oh, they do it to me.
[04:27:01.676 --> 04:27:04.159]  They go, here's a news quote that you admit you're an actor.
[04:27:04.179 --> 04:27:05.760]  I'm like, where's the video?
[04:27:05.780 --> 04:27:06.481]  It never said it.
[04:27:06.921 --> 04:27:09.063]  I've been an actor in movies, but I'm not an actor on air.
[04:27:09.303 --> 04:27:11.664]  They go, oh, you're fake.
[04:27:11.824 --> 04:27:12.445]  You're an actor.
[04:27:12.465 --> 04:27:13.726]  I never said it.
[04:27:14.186 --> 04:27:15.107]  But they just say that.
[04:27:15.187 --> 04:27:15.347]  Right.
[04:27:16.588 --> 04:27:16.768]  Right.
[04:27:17.028 --> 04:27:17.969]  Just like Joe Biden today.
[04:27:18.029 --> 04:27:22.151]  His whole defense was, I know a bunch of people who say, worst president ever.
[04:27:22.412 --> 04:27:22.752]  Really?
[04:27:22.972 --> 04:27:26.094]  Who gives a... I won't say what I was going to say.
[04:27:26.314 --> 04:27:27.175]  Who gives a rat's ass?
[04:27:27.195 --> 04:27:27.695]  Who gives a fuck?
[04:27:32.332 --> 04:27:35.534]  Who gives a shit what some guy said to Biden?
[04:27:36.014 --> 04:27:36.595]  No one cares.
[04:27:36.855 --> 04:27:38.036]  The results speak for themselves.
[04:27:38.056 --> 04:27:39.597]  So everything has to be anecdotal.
[04:27:39.957 --> 04:27:41.258]  Everything has to be someone else said it.
[04:27:41.298 --> 04:27:47.162]  But I'm telling you, if you strip the media and the entertainment industry of their power, the deep state doesn't have as much of it.
[04:27:47.882 --> 04:27:49.363]  That's their reference point.
[04:27:49.423 --> 04:27:55.025]  And that's why they're so panicked, because they're losing it, and I don't think the public realizes how much power they've got.
[04:27:55.085 --> 04:27:55.865]  Like, take your show.
[04:27:56.205 --> 04:27:57.686]  Reaches 5-10 million people a day.
[04:27:58.086 --> 04:27:59.727]  CNN's top show is to have a million.
[04:27:59.767 --> 04:28:00.787]  Their average show, 100,000.
[04:28:01.127 --> 04:28:01.947]  They're a joke.
[04:28:02.048 --> 04:28:03.228]  Why did they get the debate?
[04:28:03.608 --> 04:28:07.250]  If Elon Musk would have hosted it, or if you would have hosted it, it would have had more credibility.
[04:28:07.750 --> 04:28:13.472]  I don't understand why, because they're old, or they're vestigial, why we still bow down to them.
[04:28:13.992 --> 04:28:15.854]  The CNN's had no viewers for years.
[04:28:16.274 --> 04:28:18.216]  Tonight, yeah, they'll probably get Super Bowl numbers.
[04:28:18.596 --> 04:28:20.078]  But why were they giving it?
[04:28:20.198 --> 04:28:21.279]  I don't understand it.
[04:28:22.586 --> 04:28:24.327]  I don't either, Alex, but a couple of points.
[04:28:24.467 --> 04:28:28.009]  One, it's shows like ours and yours that are going to hold people's feet to the fire.
[04:28:28.029 --> 04:28:34.853]  It's going to hold Trump's feet to the fire when he says he's going to do certain things when he gets into office and making sure that those things actually happen.
[04:28:34.893 --> 04:28:37.874]  And number two, speaking of stuff in the media, man, we got your back.
[04:28:38.235 --> 04:28:40.536]  Anything that's going on that we can help with, man, we love you.
[04:28:40.596 --> 04:28:41.416]  We support you.
[04:28:41.456 --> 04:28:43.898]  We want to make sure that you have a voice in this election.
[04:28:44.438 --> 04:28:47.459]  So, anything that we can do, we will make sure that we do it.
[04:28:47.479 --> 04:28:48.739]  Mug Club has your back 100%.
[04:28:48.899 --> 04:28:52.480]  We've got your back, Gerald Morgan, Captain Morgan, but I want to say this.
[04:28:53.220 --> 04:28:59.322]  In the ecosystem, there's only like 10 people, and I'm not trying to, I want more competition.
[04:28:59.402 --> 04:29:00.842]  I'm not saying this to like put people down.
[04:29:01.082 --> 04:29:12.556]   There's a lot of other sub-hosts of people, but there's only so many Joe Rogans and Steven Crowder's and Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson's out there.
[04:29:12.897 --> 04:29:16.238]  There's like 10 of them and we have almost the entire audience, which is great.
[04:29:16.759 --> 04:29:20.140]  If you look at us compared to corporate media, we have 50 times the viewers.
[04:29:20.480 --> 04:29:21.461]  That's why they're so scared.
[04:29:21.481 --> 04:29:22.902]  They want to keep acting like it's not happening.
[04:29:23.322 --> 04:29:42.277]   But I see our victory as when there's a hundred hosts that know what we know because we're trying to like transmit that knowledge to them To me, it's about educating other people to transcend this, and I've got your back too, but people need to understand, there's not many people reaching 5 million people a day or 10 million like you are.
[04:29:42.657 --> 04:29:45.078]  It's not about an ass-kissing contest, it's real, folks.
[04:29:45.678 --> 04:29:49.879]  I reached 10 million, you reached 10 million, that's why the system is so scared.
[04:29:50.219 --> 04:30:01.302]  But the good news is, Elon's not perfect, but the fact that he's moving to us so fast shows, whether he's opportunistic or not, he sees where the wind is blowing.
[04:30:02.752 --> 04:30:07.414]  Yeah, no, I think you're right, and you do reach those people, and that's why, like I've said, they've gone through the sequence, right?
[04:30:07.495 --> 04:30:11.156]  And right now, they're at the final phase to try and silence you by any means necessary.
[04:30:11.556 --> 04:30:14.098]  And everyone watching right now, you can hold our feet to the fire.
[04:30:14.138 --> 04:30:14.778]  Hey, guess what?
[04:30:14.878 --> 04:30:19.300]  We'll take a removal from YouTube, if that means that... They haven't struck us yet.
[04:30:19.400 --> 04:30:21.321]  They haven't struck us yet, but we will host Alex.
[04:30:21.361 --> 04:30:24.863]  In other words, I don't know what happens here in these next couple of weeks, if you guys haven't been following us.
[04:30:25.023 --> 04:30:25.923]  Going on with Alex Jones.
[04:30:26.304 --> 04:30:34.667]  Whatever happens, we'll take the strikes, we'll have you on, because they just want to... And Alex, I know they're coming for us next, because they already are.
[04:30:35.167 --> 04:30:37.028]  So believe me, it's not lost on us.
[04:30:37.048 --> 04:30:40.370]  No, we're all in this together, and I can't give the inside baseball, but that's exactly what it is.
[04:30:40.930 --> 04:30:42.311]  I swore to be loyal to my crew.
[04:30:42.851 --> 04:30:44.171]  I thought we'd be shut down months ago.
[04:30:44.592 --> 04:30:53.036]   And now this federal judge keeps blocking them, so I'm like, And I don't want to go away, I don't want to give up, but it keeps, I mean, this is insane.
[04:30:53.316 --> 04:30:56.857]  And the rollercoaster to me and my family and the crew, I feel so sorry for them.
[04:30:57.177 --> 04:31:01.518]  Every week, they tried to send the county to shut us down two weeks ago.
[04:31:01.738 --> 04:31:03.459]  They tried to lock the doors three weeks ago.
[04:31:03.899 --> 04:31:07.520]  And it's all, and the fact is we're fighting back.
[04:31:07.560 --> 04:31:12.541]  So listeners go, well, wait, the news says you're shut down today, but you're not because we're fighting back.
[04:31:12.821 --> 04:31:15.062]  But I don't expect this attack to be here much longer.
[04:31:15.602 --> 04:31:16.603]  So I'm glad you guys there.
[04:31:16.623 --> 04:31:17.904]  I'll be a guest on your show and stuff.
[04:31:18.204 --> 04:31:18.904]  I'm not a pussy.
[04:31:18.944 --> 04:31:19.565]  I'm not giving up.
[04:31:19.985 --> 04:31:21.886]  I don't think of myself as that powerful.
[04:31:22.347 --> 04:31:28.231]  I am getting my ass literally attacked by King Kong because our message is powerful, folks.
[04:31:28.571 --> 04:31:35.556]  And that's why you've got to support the Mug Club and support everybody else to tell them the truth because they wouldn't be attacking us if this didn't threaten them.
[04:31:35.816 --> 04:31:37.757]  But at the same time, I'm like the Alamo here, man.
[04:31:38.017 --> 04:31:40.739]  I'm getting overrun right now, but I feel good about it.
[04:31:41.519 --> 04:31:42.120]  I'm a man.
[04:31:42.400 --> 04:31:44.141]  But at the same time, it is crazy.
[04:31:46.454 --> 04:31:48.615]  Well, look, anything you need, place a call.
[04:31:48.655 --> 04:31:50.436]  Right now, we're still actually on YouTube.
[04:31:50.476 --> 04:31:55.159]  Funny enough, tonight Rumble servers crashed because we had a quarter million concurrent live viewers.
[04:31:55.539 --> 04:32:04.324]  It came back, but where's the best place right now just to stick it to the homos in Palo Alto, where people can go and watch and support you?
[04:32:05.625 --> 04:32:08.647]  Real Alex Jones on X, Infowars.com.
[04:32:08.667 --> 04:32:09.527]  That's a great point you make.
[04:32:09.627 --> 04:32:11.488]  I remember I've been on Joe's show many times, Joe Rogan.
[04:32:11.907 --> 04:32:18.427]   I remember seven years ago on his show, he never hit 100,000 live at one time.
[04:32:18.427 --> 04:32:21.987]   And he got like 50 million views that week on that one interview.
[04:32:21.987 --> 04:32:23.426]  And he goes, "Oh my God."
[04:32:23.426 --> 04:32:25.346]  At the end of the show, he said, "We just hit 100,000."
[04:32:25.346 --> 04:32:29.426]  You had a quarter million people on just that stream.
[04:32:29.426 --> 04:32:32.507]  That is holy grail stuff, folks, on Rumble.
[04:32:32.507 --> 04:32:34.067]  So we're not mad at Rumble.
[04:32:34.067 --> 04:32:35.147]  We're glad they're building up.
[04:32:35.147 --> 04:32:36.626]  We're glad they're doing good.
[04:32:36.626 --> 04:32:37.787]  It's awesome.
[04:32:37.787 --> 04:32:40.188]  And so, yeah, I mean, that's it, folks.
[04:32:40.367 --> 04:32:45.051]  Just support the shows that are under attack and the shows that are the lead elephants because we're under attack.
[04:32:45.331 --> 04:32:48.814]  Support the Mug Club, support Steven Crowder and his great crew.
[04:32:48.874 --> 04:32:50.135]  Support us at InfoWars.
[04:32:50.596 --> 04:32:51.957]  InfoWars.com is still here.
[04:32:51.977 --> 04:32:54.319]  And I tell the crew every week they still stay here.
[04:32:55.200 --> 04:32:57.201]  I'm just like, well, I swore I wouldn't leave.
[04:32:57.241 --> 04:32:59.703]  I thought we'd be shut down a month ago and then we're not.
[04:32:59.743 --> 04:33:11.839]   So I kind of have this promise to the crew and I'm not like wishing we're going to get shut down, but I'm kind of like, You know, it just it's become such a roller coaster soap opera that my eyes are crossed at this point.
[04:33:11.919 --> 04:33:16.842]  So it's an epic moment, but Infowars is hard to kill, but we're right there at the edge.
[04:33:17.363 --> 04:33:18.343]  And so that's where we are.
[04:33:18.403 --> 04:33:19.444]  Thank you so much, guys.
[04:33:20.825 --> 04:33:21.265]  Absolutely.
[04:33:21.325 --> 04:33:25.328]  Brave people are difficult to kill and more useful in general.
[04:33:25.828 --> 04:33:27.289]  And we appreciate it, Alex.
[04:33:27.329 --> 04:33:28.910]  I know you have your own show to go back to.
[04:33:29.271 --> 04:33:29.731]  We'll be back.
[04:33:29.751 --> 04:33:30.311]  I'm going to end it.
[04:33:30.331 --> 04:33:31.012]  We love you, Alex.
[04:33:31.032 --> 04:33:31.292]  See you, man.
[04:33:31.312 --> 04:33:31.612]  Thank you.
[04:33:32.933 --> 04:33:33.273]  Absolutely.
[04:33:33.353 --> 04:33:34.294]  Alex Jones, everybody.
[04:33:36.167 --> 04:33:37.208]  Alright, there goes Steven Crowder.
[04:33:37.748 --> 04:33:40.750]  Yeah, I mean, look, I haven't even talked about this today, folks.
[04:33:40.830 --> 04:33:44.552]  There was an incredible court hearing this morning, and it was so insane.
[04:33:44.573 --> 04:33:48.275]  The judge said to the other side, you've committed crimes, you tried to seize the company again.
[04:33:48.775 --> 04:33:51.737]  And I'm like, I feel like I'm like the boy crying wolf.
[04:33:51.757 --> 04:33:54.359]  I have like 17 werewolves attacking me.
[04:33:54.904 --> 04:34:27.794]   I mean, you know, because God keeps keeping us going, and I'm on air like, they're trying to lock the doors, and then we stop them, and then you see the violence, shut us down, shut us down, and the marshals are coming, and then it doesn't happen, and then, like, the judge today said, no, you're not shutting it down, I've got the articles right here, and I don't want to sit here and talk about me all day, you know, they brought it up, I mean, like, you know, I mean, the one thing I've got is my integrity, folks, I've got integrity, like, I'm a straight shooter, I love everybody, And I'm sitting here like, I love God.
[04:34:29.136 --> 04:34:29.877]  I love God a lot.
[04:34:30.678 --> 04:34:31.719]  And God is all-powerful.
[04:34:31.799 --> 04:34:32.801]  I try to understand God.
[04:34:32.861 --> 04:34:36.205]  I'm like, God, what is this yo-yo thing?
[04:34:36.686 --> 04:34:37.607]  And then I kind of get it.
[04:34:37.647 --> 04:34:39.910]  God's like, we're making a huge spectacle out of you, boy.
[04:34:39.930 --> 04:34:41.512]  You want to fight New World Order?
[04:34:42.196 --> 04:34:43.077]  I'm gonna give them what they want.
[04:34:43.197 --> 04:34:48.865]  And I'm like, when I finally realize God's in control, I sit back and I go, holy hell, God is real.
[04:34:49.225 --> 04:34:55.734]  They are literally yo-yoing us in front of the world like God ain't gonna let us get blown up easily.
[04:34:55.754 --> 04:34:56.735]  And maybe he keeps us going.
[04:34:57.476 --> 04:34:57.917]  I don't know.
[04:34:58.843 --> 04:34:59.263]  I don't know.
[04:34:59.704 --> 04:35:00.484]  But enough about me.
[04:35:00.744 --> 04:35:07.268]  But I've got New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, AP, Reuters, with them saying, we don't want money, we want Alex Jones shut down.
[04:35:07.608 --> 04:35:11.510]  And the judge said, you don't destroy value just because you hate somebody.
[04:35:11.770 --> 04:35:12.691]  You've committed crimes.
[04:35:12.971 --> 04:35:14.072]  That was today.
[04:35:14.532 --> 04:35:16.373]  I have the transcript.
[04:35:17.774 --> 04:35:20.935]  I mean, this is cuckoo level.
[04:35:21.716 --> 04:35:23.457]  And I'm a Machiavellian, if I have to be.
[04:35:24.213 --> 04:35:25.573]  Shut us down, we'll get even bigger.
[04:35:26.053 --> 04:35:27.114]  But God won't let that happen.
[04:35:27.194 --> 04:35:28.694]  And I've not ever backed down.
[04:35:28.734 --> 04:35:31.915]  I've never backed down and just lost to, like, be a pussy.
[04:35:31.935 --> 04:35:38.916]  But at the same time, I'm like... They tried to shut us down in five filings in four weeks.
[04:35:39.536 --> 04:35:40.616]  They tried to close the doors.
[04:35:41.537 --> 04:35:42.277]  It's all over the news.
[04:35:42.337 --> 04:35:43.297]  We're shut down tomorrow.
[04:35:43.717 --> 04:35:44.477]  And it doesn't happen.
[04:35:44.517 --> 04:35:47.478]  I'm like... This is crazy.
[04:35:49.690 --> 04:35:51.230]  I don't want to talk about myself anymore.
[04:35:51.310 --> 04:35:56.052]  Tomorrow, if we're still on air, God knows what'll happen, I will try to cover this.
[04:35:56.072 --> 04:36:00.113]  But I want to go to Robert Barnes, one of my best friends, really admire him.
[04:36:00.473 --> 04:36:03.173]  Constitutional lawyer, great mind on this.
[04:36:03.193 --> 04:36:05.434]  Do not talk about me, even though it's very interesting.
[04:36:06.874 --> 04:36:10.655]  Let's talk about Trump because we need to unpack what happened tonight.
[04:36:10.715 --> 04:36:13.956]  This was a devastating round.
[04:36:15.416 --> 04:36:16.316]  This was historical.
[04:36:16.677 --> 04:36:18.537]  The whole system, we showed you some of it.
[04:36:20.345 --> 04:36:23.788]  From CNN to MSNBC, the Drugs Report totally turning against Biden.
[04:36:25.729 --> 04:36:26.670]  What is really going on?
[04:36:27.150 --> 04:36:29.072]  Robert Barnes, you've got your ear to the ground.
[04:36:29.192 --> 04:36:30.733]  What the hell did we just watch?
[04:36:32.194 --> 04:36:41.541]  Well, I think we saw Trump, the most focused he has been in a debate since that very first Republican debate, where Megyn Kelly was subscribed to take him out.
[04:36:42.002 --> 04:36:47.266]  And he took her out and took Rupert Murdoch out with the very first answer to the very first question.
[04:36:48.130 --> 04:36:50.432]  And tonight he was very much on his game.
[04:36:50.472 --> 04:36:51.293]  He stayed disciplined.
[04:36:51.313 --> 04:36:52.094]  He stayed focused.
[04:36:52.454 --> 04:36:59.540]  He kept bringing the points back to illegal immigration, to the economy, to the war overseas.
[04:36:59.700 --> 04:37:01.482]  With Biden, what you get is disaster.
[04:37:01.542 --> 04:37:02.203]  You get war.
[04:37:02.243 --> 04:37:03.003]  You get poverty.
[04:37:03.023 --> 04:37:04.064]  You get crime.
[04:37:04.104 --> 04:37:06.066]  You get immigration everywhere.
[04:37:06.106 --> 04:37:07.107]  And that impacts everybody.
[04:37:07.447 --> 04:37:09.871]  It impacts white jobs, black jobs, Hispanic jobs.
[04:37:09.911 --> 04:37:11.173]  It impacts Social Security.
[04:37:11.193 --> 04:37:12.474]  It impacts Medicare.
[04:37:12.695 --> 04:37:13.716]  It impacts Medicaid.
[04:37:13.776 --> 04:37:14.778]  It impacts health care.
[04:37:14.998 --> 04:37:16.140]  It impacts child care.
[04:37:16.340 --> 04:37:17.281]  It impacts housing.
[04:37:17.582 --> 04:37:23.270]  He's like, the vets are on the street homeless while illegal immigrants are being put up in luxury hotels in New York City.
[04:37:23.832 --> 04:37:31.578]  So and then, you know, I mean, that great point is you pointed out right at the time where the where Biden thought, you know, Social Security, Medicare be the big winners.
[04:37:31.618 --> 04:37:35.861]  They usually are for the Democrats because Republicans usually have dumb ideas about them.
[04:37:36.441 --> 04:37:39.824]  And Biden says, you know, I beat, beat Medicare.
[04:37:40.144 --> 04:37:41.445]  And he's like, yeah, you beat it to death.
[04:37:42.046 --> 04:37:45.068]  And so it was it was really brilliantly handled by Trump.
[04:37:45.128 --> 04:37:46.049]  He was on his game.
[04:37:46.089 --> 04:37:47.350]  He was ready to take it apart.
[04:37:47.530 --> 04:37:50.392]  He looked younger than four years ago.
[04:37:51.619 --> 04:37:52.159]  Absolutely.
[04:37:52.480 --> 04:37:53.280]  I mean, whatever.
[04:37:53.320 --> 04:37:55.061]  I mean, he has high, high energy.
[04:37:55.141 --> 04:37:57.823]  It's right there, but you've seen it in person.
[04:37:58.023 --> 04:37:59.303]  You see it with his signature.
[04:38:00.144 --> 04:38:01.324]  If you're ever around... He's a warrior.
[04:38:01.344 --> 04:38:02.045]  He's a warrior.
[04:38:03.145 --> 04:38:03.706]  Yeah, completely.
[04:38:04.046 --> 04:38:14.732]  And he pointed out, you know, I thought it was good when he came back to the... He didn't take the bait on many of the distractions, the bogus scandals, the fake stories... Oh, I love how he ignored the questions, because the questions were where it was rigged.
[04:38:16.158 --> 04:38:16.599]  Absolutely.
[04:38:17.139 --> 04:38:18.100]  And at multiple levels.
[04:38:18.321 --> 04:38:24.248]  Because, I mean, that was sort of the goal and the objective of the debate was to recast 2020 and throw in the lawfare.
[04:38:24.648 --> 04:38:30.415]  And they thought we could do the bogus scandals for 2020 and Joe Biden will be... You know who Joe Biden is?
[04:38:30.735 --> 04:38:33.458]  Do you remember that Mumbles character from Dick Tracy?
[04:38:33.659 --> 04:38:33.799]  I do.
[04:38:35.100 --> 04:38:36.901]  The Warren Beatty movie?
[04:38:37.001 --> 04:38:37.841]  He is that guy.
[04:38:38.081 --> 04:38:39.481]  He's literally the Mumbles character.
[04:38:39.501 --> 04:38:41.102]  I think it was played by Dustin Hoffman.
[04:38:41.442 --> 04:38:43.503]  You know, all that stuff?
[04:38:43.783 --> 04:38:45.103]  I mean, that's who he is for life.
[04:38:45.483 --> 04:38:50.785]  And even with all the drugs, even with a week of preparation, he could barely get through 90 minutes.
[04:38:51.725 --> 04:38:56.007]  So it just shows that whatever they thought was going to happen, didn't happen.
[04:38:56.367 --> 04:38:57.127]  That they didn't try.
[04:38:57.167 --> 04:38:59.228]  Biden would just look down and you know.
[04:39:00.552 --> 04:39:01.213]  Oh, absolutely.
[04:39:01.333 --> 04:39:02.535]  I mean, it was just embarrassing.
[04:39:02.575 --> 04:39:08.946]  Although, I mean, even as you're pointing out, CNN, MSNBC, Twitter... Oh, they turned on him like a pack of sharks.
[04:39:10.174 --> 04:39:10.714]  Completely.
[04:39:11.155 --> 04:39:15.678]  Because I think they thought they would get a redo of 2020, where they're able to distract Trump at times.
[04:39:16.079 --> 04:39:18.861]  And Biden, I mean, you were the first person to point this out early 2020.
[04:39:19.161 --> 04:39:23.304]  Remember, it was the original excuse to take you off Instagram.
[04:39:23.604 --> 04:39:27.887]  Was you're saying something's going wrong with Joe Biden's mental health, his mental acuity.
[04:39:28.248 --> 04:39:29.669]  It's going to go on the decline.
[04:39:30.029 --> 04:39:33.251]  And they were so scared of that story that they banned you from Instagram.
[04:39:33.271 --> 04:39:36.854]  Well, clearly, because he was okay, and suddenly couldn't talk.
[04:39:36.914 --> 04:39:37.875]  I said, he's had a stroke again.
[04:39:39.131 --> 04:39:39.572]  Exactly!
[04:39:39.772 --> 04:39:40.372]  And it's clear!
[04:39:40.512 --> 04:39:49.640]  I was asking people what drugs explain the whole eyes thing, the no blinking thing, and the most common response was, this is early signs of Parkinson's.
[04:39:50.260 --> 04:39:54.404]  That no drug can compensate for.
[04:39:54.984 --> 04:40:04.608]  And so this was supposed to prove that he could get by in the debate, that they could trap Trump again, that he could survive and sustain, and that there would be a game changer.
[04:40:04.728 --> 04:40:06.229]  Because Trump doesn't need a game changer.
[04:40:06.269 --> 04:40:07.129]  He's up in the polls.
[04:40:07.189 --> 04:40:08.110]  He's winning everywhere.
[04:40:08.470 --> 04:40:09.950]  Biden needs the game changer.
[04:40:10.091 --> 04:40:11.091]  Biden is behind.
[04:40:11.758 --> 04:40:19.986]  And Trump agreed, you know, somewhat risky to these terms and conditions of the debate because his gamble paid off.
[04:40:20.607 --> 04:40:23.930]  His gamble was that Biden is not the same Biden of even four years ago.
[04:40:24.190 --> 04:40:25.372]  So let me ask you this.
[04:40:26.673 --> 04:40:29.135]  People that just tuned in, we've played some of CNN.
[04:40:29.656 --> 04:40:31.598]  It was all bloodbath replaced Biden.
[04:40:31.638 --> 04:40:35.682]  They're now officially saying, and Roger Stone said three years ago, what do you think comes next?
[04:40:37.017 --> 04:40:39.040]  Well, I mean, they have a practical problem.
[04:40:39.420 --> 04:40:47.570]  So they have a legal problem with removing him from, there's issues with the Ohio ballot, of him even having ballot access, of the Democratic Party having ballot access if they replace him.
[04:40:47.590 --> 04:40:49.172]  Because they were too lazy to even file it.
[04:40:50.222 --> 04:40:50.722]  That's correct.
[04:40:51.463 --> 04:40:54.805]  Then in the other ballots, they got to get that in by early August.
[04:40:55.446 --> 04:41:01.150]  And if they don't get it in by early August, it creates all these problems because they start printing the ballots in August.
[04:41:01.831 --> 04:41:07.535]  They've established all these, I think, bogus deadlines for independent and third party candidates, but now they're kind of stuck with them.
[04:41:08.075 --> 04:41:10.077]  So they would have to move very, very fast.
[04:41:10.557 --> 04:41:17.323]  And you can't move Biden out without also moving Kamala Harris out, because Kamala Harris is more unpopular than Biden.
[04:41:17.644 --> 04:41:20.026]  She's universally despised in D.C.
[04:41:20.166 --> 04:41:21.147]  and across America.
[04:41:21.647 --> 04:41:23.629]  So how do you get her out of the way?
[04:41:23.649 --> 04:41:29.874]  Black people, she was got 1% with the general, 2% with general voters, 1% with blacks.
[04:41:29.935 --> 04:41:30.515]  Blacks hate her.
[04:41:30.555 --> 04:41:31.456]  She's not a black woman.
[04:41:32.808 --> 04:41:33.188]  Exactly.
[04:41:33.228 --> 04:41:37.029]  Then the next problem is Gavin Newsom is extremely unpopular in the Midwest.
[04:41:37.470 --> 04:41:40.310]  Working class, you know, I mean, we know some of these people.
[04:41:40.570 --> 04:41:49.593]  The kind of people that are holding on to Biden are your older blue-collar Democrat from the Midwest that doesn't mind corrupt Uncle Joe because corrupt Uncle Joe helped Junior get a job.
[04:41:49.713 --> 04:41:50.974]  You know, that kind of, right?
[04:41:51.594 --> 04:41:54.015]  Gavin Newsom says blow-dried San Francisco.
[04:41:54.395 --> 04:41:57.796]  Says the guy, you know, probably bats both ways.
[04:41:58.196 --> 04:42:01.197]  You know, he's not somebody who plays well in blue-collar middle America.
[04:42:01.737 --> 04:42:03.078]  And so he's not an option.
[04:42:03.759 --> 04:42:09.764]  Nor is Big Mike an option because she hates the American people more than anybody.
[04:42:10.164 --> 04:42:13.487]  So you know who's going to want to usurp this opportunity?
[04:42:13.727 --> 04:42:21.493]  Wait to see if you don't start seeing leaks that the person who's willing to come to the rescue of the Democratic Party is one Hillary Rodham.
[04:42:22.053 --> 04:42:22.574]  No, I agree.
[04:42:22.614 --> 04:42:24.055]  I've seen articles pushing her now.
[04:42:25.649 --> 04:42:27.631]  Yeah, and I think that's a substantial risk.
[04:42:28.532 --> 04:42:31.355]  I mean, I think that if you're Biden, that's what you're worried about.
[04:42:31.415 --> 04:42:33.237]  But how do they take Kamala Harris out?
[04:42:33.678 --> 04:42:34.659]  That's what I've always said.
[04:42:34.699 --> 04:42:40.465]  As I said, if you want to figure out how they replace Biden, figure out first how they replace Kamala Harris.
[04:42:40.725 --> 04:42:44.670]  But Biden, let's go back to that, but Biden is an Obama property.
[04:42:45.070 --> 04:42:45.971]  They don't like the Clems.
[04:42:45.991 --> 04:42:46.552]  How does that play?
[04:42:48.051 --> 04:42:49.731]  That's another problem, right?
[04:42:50.172 --> 04:42:52.492]  There's so many internal divides.
[04:42:52.672 --> 04:42:59.654]  I mean, the Clintons effectively erased the Democratic bitch, except for the Obama crew.
[04:43:00.054 --> 04:43:06.295]  And the Obama crew is a bunch of professional managerial class people from the coast who are utterly hated in middle America.
[04:43:06.836 --> 04:43:13.037]  Obama could get by because he was the first black president who was personally likable to most Americans.
[04:43:13.787 --> 04:43:15.789]  Uh, and his policies never were popular.
[04:43:16.169 --> 04:43:22.855]  He skated by because Americans really wanted the first black president to- Yeah, we wanted to end racism and setting it at 10 times worse.
[04:43:23.943 --> 04:43:25.004]  Exactly, exactly.
[04:43:25.084 --> 04:43:29.505]  And because of that experience, now they thought they could recreate that with Kamala Harris.
[04:43:29.786 --> 04:43:44.772]  You know, another person born of immigrants, another person biracial, another person not really raised in America, another person who's related like Obama to... I mean, what's unique about Obama and Kamala Harris, first black president, first black vice president, neither one of them have ancestors that were slaves.
[04:43:45.112 --> 04:43:46.933]  But they do have ancestors that were slave owners.
[04:43:47.373 --> 04:43:49.834]  I mean, that's what that tells you what the Democratic Party really is.
[04:43:49.854 --> 04:43:51.114]  And meanwhile, they did the genealogy.
[04:43:51.154 --> 04:43:52.315]  Trump is the only president that did.
[04:43:53.464 --> 04:43:54.265]  That's exactly right.
[04:43:54.785 --> 04:43:55.685]  Trump and John Kennedy.
[04:43:56.006 --> 04:44:00.748]  They're also the only two presidents that were poor while they were in the White House.
[04:44:01.589 --> 04:44:04.771]  And they impeached and indicted one, and they assassinated the other.
[04:44:05.251 --> 04:44:14.377]  I think the concern we have to have is if the state gets into a dark mood, that there are bad events that could be forthcoming.
[04:44:14.517 --> 04:44:17.078]  I mean, there is a way to remove- Well, that's what I was about to say.
[04:44:17.138 --> 04:44:18.919]  We're all really positive right now.
[04:44:19.019 --> 04:44:22.922]  Like the wolf says in Pulp Fiction, let's start sucking each other's dicks right now.
[04:44:23.502 --> 04:44:24.882]  They're gonna pull something big.
[04:44:25.123 --> 04:44:27.563]  I mean, let's not get that sideways here.
[04:44:28.784 --> 04:44:36.666]  Yeah, to be honest with you, I would have preferred if their takeaway had been, oh, this was okay, Biden is still reasonable, Trump is still crazy.
[04:44:37.006 --> 04:44:42.127]  If that had been the CNN, MSNBC, New York Times, Twitter take tonight from the Twitter left.
[04:44:42.388 --> 04:44:47.069]  I mean, even like black Twitter was just saying, it was just ragging on Biden the entire debate.
[04:44:47.809 --> 04:44:51.570]  Uh, so, I mean, I think they thought that they bought their own fake news stories.
[04:44:51.950 --> 04:44:58.872]  That, hey, all these examples of Biden having problems are made up and they're fake videos, and it's like, no they're not!
[04:44:59.332 --> 04:45:02.493]  And so the, I think they bought into their own fake news stories about Trump.
[04:45:02.833 --> 04:45:06.574]  That, you know, Trump won't be able to control himself, that Trump will go off, that Trump won't be gay.
[04:45:06.594 --> 04:45:12.175]  And by the way, it's now in the New York Times, Sacramento Bee, you name it, they're openly saying replace Biden officially.
[04:45:13.382 --> 04:45:13.983]  Yeah, exactly.
[04:45:14.303 --> 04:45:25.391]  I mean, Roger Stone is completely, not just vindicated, he literally said this in January of 2021 when Biden was inaugurated.
[04:45:25.431 --> 04:45:27.833]  He said, watch, they'll replace him at the inauguration.
[04:45:27.893 --> 04:45:28.693]  It's happening now.
[04:45:28.733 --> 04:45:31.455]  And by the way, Roger Stone with Look What House is coming up.
[04:45:31.516 --> 04:45:32.116]  I mean, wow.
[04:45:32.456 --> 04:45:34.598]  Roger Stone gets an extra gold star for this.
[04:45:35.717 --> 04:45:37.958]  Well, their original plan was to use Kamala Harris.
[04:45:38.238 --> 04:45:42.580]  They just didn't realize she was as dumb as she is and would be as unpopular as she is.
[04:45:43.040 --> 04:45:47.182]  They thought she was like, you look at this, Justin Trudeau in Canada, Macron in France.
[04:45:47.802 --> 04:45:52.864]  I mean, you can get up the old videos of Macron dancing the way Zelensky danced at, you know, various places.
[04:45:52.904 --> 04:45:54.225]  I mean, these people are totally fake.
[04:45:54.825 --> 04:46:05.631]  And the belief was, if we could have this manufactured candidate who fits the identity checklist, then we can recreate the Obama phenomenon the way we did with Macron, the way we did with Trudeau.
[04:46:05.911 --> 04:46:07.171]  We can do it with Kamala Harris.
[04:46:07.531 --> 04:46:12.254]  And the goal was, you know, within a year or two, push Uncle Joe out and bring Kamala in.
[04:46:12.754 --> 04:46:20.298]  But it didn't work, so in closing, and we appreciate your time, join me tomorrow if you will, Robert Barnes, what does the deep state do now?
[04:46:21.849 --> 04:46:24.930]  That's what we should all be scared and concerned about.
[04:46:25.490 --> 04:46:36.394]  Is that if they recognize the disaster this was, that mumbling bumbling Biden is the debacle that he was on live TV, what bad game plan will they come up with next?
[04:46:37.514 --> 04:46:38.114]  And what is that?
[04:46:40.495 --> 04:46:41.135]  I'm concerned.
[04:46:41.355 --> 04:46:42.996]  Well, they already said it.
[04:46:43.036 --> 04:46:44.736]  They said he's done, he's horrible.
[04:46:45.977 --> 04:46:48.998]  Unanimously on CNN, the panel said dump him.
[04:46:49.038 --> 04:46:49.598]  So what happens?
[04:46:51.114 --> 04:47:00.757]  Well, I mean, if you're in their planning room, you would want someone you could blame on Trump assassinating both Biden and Kamala Harris.
[04:47:01.057 --> 04:47:01.658]  No, I agree.
[04:47:01.738 --> 04:47:05.719]  So they assassinate Biden to turn defeat into victory.
[04:47:06.879 --> 04:47:08.100]  Yeah, I mean, exactly.
[04:47:08.620 --> 04:47:08.940]  Exactly.
[04:47:09.120 --> 04:47:11.841]  And you probably need to take Harris out at the same time.
[04:47:12.541 --> 04:47:14.462]  It solves your problem of Biden and Harris.
[04:47:15.402 --> 04:47:18.003]  It makes him a martyr, a sacrificial lamb.
[04:47:19.330 --> 04:47:27.697]  And it greenlights bringing somebody else in, but doing so not on the sign of weakness, but a rally around the country kind of effect.
[04:47:28.157 --> 04:47:30.840]  And you say, see how dangerous the Trump supporters are.
[04:47:31.000 --> 04:47:32.661]  See how dangerous Trump's speech is.
[04:47:33.662 --> 04:47:39.447]  They're already planning that in the gag order that they're seeking to Trump in the Florida case.
[04:47:39.507 --> 04:47:43.751]  They're saying, look at how everybody gets secret signals from Trump to do violent acts.
[04:47:44.451 --> 04:47:49.715]  They prosecuted someone that supposedly made threats against the president related to that.
[04:47:50.075 --> 04:47:55.979]  So I would be concerned that they escalate in a very, very deep state kind of way.
[04:47:56.660 --> 04:47:58.201]  That would be my greatest concern.
[04:47:58.361 --> 04:47:59.101]  I hope they don't.
[04:47:59.621 --> 04:48:11.049]  I hope they say, well, we can survive this, that we can continue to use the lawfare against Trump like they, I mean, it's clear tonight, the Biden's entire campaign plan is not Trump.
[04:48:11.309 --> 04:48:13.691]  And the whole basis of not Trump is the lawfare.
[04:48:14.131 --> 04:48:15.672]  Look at the criminal cases.
[04:48:15.712 --> 04:48:16.833]  Look at the civil cases.
[04:48:17.994 --> 04:48:19.174]  It's a day late, a dollar short.
[04:48:19.195 --> 04:48:20.796]  So Barnes, you're hard to get on.
[04:48:20.876 --> 04:48:23.057]  We're going to have a huge audience tomorrow.
[04:48:23.617 --> 04:48:28.200]  Tell the producers when you'll come on with 30 Minutes tomorrow in the aftermath to give your take 10.
[04:48:28.661 --> 04:48:29.421]  Promise you'll come on.
[04:48:29.581 --> 04:48:30.602]  Are you busy in court?
[04:48:30.622 --> 04:48:31.102]  Come on tomorrow.
[04:48:31.342 --> 04:48:31.503]  Yeah.
[04:48:32.243 --> 04:48:32.463]  Oh, no.
[04:48:32.483 --> 04:48:33.764]  Tomorrow, no court, nothing.
[04:48:33.804 --> 04:48:35.685]  I'm free all day tomorrow.
[04:48:36.646 --> 04:48:37.326]  Join me tomorrow.
[04:48:37.567 --> 04:48:38.747]  How do people find your podcast?
[04:48:40.288 --> 04:48:45.817]   VivaBarnesLaw.Locals.com But bottom line, 30 second closing comment.
[04:48:47.038 --> 04:48:49.380]  Disaster, total rout.
[04:48:49.480 --> 04:48:54.886]  I mean, why would CNN, I mean, they were literally saying, we gotta get rid of Biden.
[04:48:54.926 --> 04:48:56.327]  This is historic.
[04:48:56.367 --> 04:48:57.288]  I don't even have words for it.
[04:48:58.630 --> 04:49:05.577]  Yeah, it's the biggest debate debacle I can remember since Michael Dukakis couldn't know whether he should use the death penalty if someone raped and murdered his wife.
[04:49:06.347 --> 04:49:08.748]  Uh, in terms of Joe Biden's disastrous performance.
[04:49:08.868 --> 04:49:16.132]  And Trump, one of the great debaters of all time, it was the best debate performance he's ever had of all the debates he's ever done.
[04:49:16.692 --> 04:49:22.595]  And the combination is great, as long as the deep state doesn't escalate in a dangerous and dark way in the coming days.
[04:49:22.915 --> 04:49:24.476]  Yeah, that's the real issue, folks.
[04:49:24.496 --> 04:49:30.839]  So, to quote DeWolf again, from Pulp Fiction, let's not start sucking each other's dicks yet.
[04:49:31.300 --> 04:49:32.440]  Alright, Robert Barnes, thank you.
[04:49:33.761 --> 04:49:34.361]  Glad to be here, Alex.
[04:49:34.861 --> 04:49:35.662]  Short little clip.
[04:49:36.809 --> 04:49:39.944]  We're going right to Roger Stone and Luke Rodowski.
[04:49:40.025 --> 04:49:40.507]  Stay with us.
[04:49:42.552 --> 04:49:45.153]  Emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, the U.S.
[04:49:45.173 --> 04:49:45.693]  resistance.
[04:49:46.133 --> 04:49:53.416]  It's a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[04:49:53.896 --> 04:49:56.377]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[04:49:56.397 --> 04:49:57.878]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[04:49:58.218 --> 04:50:00.139]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[04:50:00.379 --> 04:50:02.500]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[04:50:02.720 --> 04:50:03.780]  This is all confirmed.
[04:50:03.800 --> 04:50:04.760]  This is not a drill.
[04:50:04.900 --> 04:50:08.862]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[04:50:09.162 --> 04:50:10.582]  They've officially become state broad.
[04:50:10.702 --> 04:50:11.183]  Apple 100%.
[04:50:11.583 --> 04:50:17.244]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[04:50:17.664 --> 04:50:22.446]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[04:50:22.726 --> 04:50:23.586]  This is happening.
[04:50:23.606 --> 04:50:31.548]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[04:50:31.608 --> 04:50:37.590]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[04:50:37.990 --> 04:50:45.958]  This is a titrated dose reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation.
[04:50:46.849 --> 04:50:50.351]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[04:50:50.671 --> 04:50:53.852]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[04:50:54.152 --> 04:51:01.155]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[04:51:01.435 --> 04:51:04.076]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[04:51:04.416 --> 04:51:09.617]   Total Internet of Things integration, global social score, complete command and control system.
[04:51:09.617 --> 04:51:14.457]   It is the virtual reality AI weapon system now attacking the United States
[04:51:14.457 --> 04:51:19.218]   with traitors inside the major security agencies, blocking Trump's resistance of the program
[04:51:19.218 --> 04:51:25.617]   and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles of the Chi-Com/Big Tech hanging combine emergency situation.
[04:51:25.617 --> 04:51:28.856]   I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information
[04:51:28.856 --> 04:51:31.937]  and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[04:51:31.937 --> 04:51:37.937]   They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception
[04:51:37.937 --> 04:51:40.657]  where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[04:51:40.688 --> 04:51:45.590]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[04:51:45.970 --> 04:51:49.071]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars.
[04:51:49.271 --> 04:51:50.872]  And so they make me a murderer of children.
[04:51:51.252 --> 04:51:58.415]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[04:51:59.375 --> 04:52:06.098]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[04:52:06.559 --> 04:52:11.901]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum, and it's being used against you.
[04:52:12.141 --> 04:52:16.903]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[04:52:17.064 --> 04:52:18.984]  I have given you the transmission!
[04:52:19.105 --> 04:52:20.205]  Now break free!
[04:52:21.105 --> 04:52:32.667]   I have sworn upon the altar of God Eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[04:52:33.288 --> 04:52:35.730]  Thomas Jefferson.
[04:52:35.830 --> 04:52:39.774]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[04:52:40.314 --> 04:52:50.314]  It's 1039 Central Standard Time.
[04:52:51.013 --> 04:52:57.036]  Donald Trump just mocked the floor with the pedophile Muppet that is Joe Biden.
[04:52:57.336 --> 04:53:05.140]  And now, to cover the rest of the story is the great Roger Stone and Luke Rodowski.
[04:53:05.260 --> 04:53:07.421]  Gentlemen, so honored to have you.
[04:53:07.441 --> 04:53:08.502]  What an epic moment.
[04:53:08.822 --> 04:53:13.224]  We should talk about what we saw tonight, but also how the empire will strike back, gentlemen.
[04:53:15.103 --> 04:53:20.786]  Alex, this played out, as you pointed out, exactly as I said it would almost three years ago.
[04:53:21.726 --> 04:53:29.350]  There's a lot of people celebrating tonight, Barack Obama and his wife, Hillary Clinton, who's trying to figure out how to maneuver in here herself.
[04:53:30.111 --> 04:53:33.192]  This was the unmitigated disaster that I think it was set up to be.
[04:53:33.252 --> 04:53:36.554]  In other words, I think this was orchestrated from the beginning.
[04:53:37.414 --> 04:53:39.435]  That's why we have a debate so early.
[04:53:39.515 --> 04:53:45.010]   Why would Joe Biden Propose a debate months before he's even going to be the
[04:53:45.010 --> 04:53:52.640]   official illegal nominee of the Democratic Party And why would his handlers let this go forward knowing what
[04:53:52.640 --> 04:53:54.150]  a cataclysmic disaster?
[04:53:54.150 --> 04:54:01.709]   Like piranhas attack him immediately CNN political the corporate media right now is reading from
[04:54:01.709 --> 04:54:04.285]   the same script Biden is done.
[04:54:04.305 --> 04:54:05.946]  The puppet has been ditched.
[04:54:06.307 --> 04:54:12.550]  This is a controlled demolition of the Biden administration, and we're seeing it unfold right in front of our eyes.
[04:54:12.610 --> 04:54:14.432]  And, you know, Roger has been saying this.
[04:54:14.652 --> 04:54:16.173]  He said this on our show a couple months ago.
[04:54:16.253 --> 04:54:19.395]  He said this many, many months ago, even before then.
[04:54:19.715 --> 04:54:20.555]  He has called it.
[04:54:20.595 --> 04:54:24.718]  We just finished an incredible four-hour live broadcast going through this entire debate.
[04:54:25.058 --> 04:54:29.021]  We're kind of scratching our heads, but we thought about the same thing because Roger brought it up.
[04:54:29.081 --> 04:54:30.682]  Roger was calling it from the very beginning.
[04:54:30.942 --> 04:54:34.985]  There was significant pressures that they were testing the waters with against Joe Biden.
[04:54:35.266 --> 04:54:37.447]  They were kind of attacking him, not really attacking him.
[04:54:37.487 --> 04:54:38.568]  They put pressure on Hunter.
[04:54:38.908 --> 04:54:41.090]  But now I think the endgame is clear.
[04:54:41.250 --> 04:54:41.971]  He is out.
[04:54:42.111 --> 04:54:43.532]  He's not going to be the nominee.
[04:54:43.772 --> 04:54:47.755]  There's going to be a lot of surprises this upcoming election cycle.
[04:54:48.335 --> 04:54:50.756]  And people better strap in because it's going to get wild.
[04:54:50.816 --> 04:54:51.557]  It's going to get crazy.
[04:54:51.597 --> 04:54:54.858]  And Roger Stone here predicted it from the very beginning.
[04:54:55.178 --> 04:54:59.561]  And his analysis, especially when it comes to Obama's involvement here, is key.
[04:54:59.881 --> 04:55:01.862]  Michelle Obama, she's calling.
[04:55:02.322 --> 04:55:05.523]  And there's people who's going to be picking up that phone right now.
[04:55:05.643 --> 04:55:07.384]  And she's going to be calling the shots here.
[04:55:07.824 --> 04:55:08.985]  You definitely called it, Roger.
[04:55:09.025 --> 04:55:11.346]  I want to go into the bad news of their counterstrike.
[04:55:11.366 --> 04:55:17.129]  But Trump did a great job, though, regardless of this being Trump's performance.
[04:55:18.315 --> 04:55:19.636]  Extraordinarily disciplined.
[04:55:19.756 --> 04:55:20.656]  Never took the bait.
[04:55:21.397 --> 04:55:24.138]  Never, not even once, did he seem to lose his temper.
[04:55:25.098 --> 04:55:27.379]  He had Joe, I think, on the ropes.
[04:55:28.240 --> 04:55:31.962]  Joe just, I mean, the guy's ability to lie is really amazing.
[04:55:32.002 --> 04:55:35.103]  I mean, the Charlottesville lie, recycled.
[04:55:35.183 --> 04:55:38.025]  The loser, losers and suckers lie, recycled.
[04:55:39.478 --> 04:55:41.159]  Uh, he can't help himself.
[04:55:41.759 --> 04:55:46.422]  Uh, and it looks to me like if this guy did preparation, he appeared to me like he'd done no preparation.
[04:55:46.802 --> 04:55:49.263]  Then they try to put out the word, Oh, Joe had a cold.
[04:55:50.044 --> 04:55:53.125]  There was something, some weird quality in his voice.
[04:55:53.185 --> 04:55:54.866]  I thought that was kind of strange, but.
[04:55:56.168 --> 04:55:57.750]  No, there's no question about this.
[04:55:58.251 --> 04:56:00.974]  As Luke said, the talking points have gone out.
[04:56:01.055 --> 04:56:08.004]  They went out immediately and all the corporate media monkeys just jump on the talking points.
[04:56:08.264 --> 04:56:10.007]  What was the switch in CNN's headline?
[04:56:10.547 --> 04:56:13.890]  Aggressive sources say damage control.
[04:56:13.910 --> 04:56:15.091]  We're freaking out.
[04:56:15.111 --> 04:56:15.772]  We're losing.
[04:56:16.112 --> 04:56:22.218]  And you know this is again a major realization and as you mentioned Biden lied from the very beginning of this.
[04:56:22.258 --> 04:56:25.220]  He was saying Trump was telling people to inject bleach into their veins.
[04:56:25.441 --> 04:56:26.101]  That never happened.
[04:56:26.401 --> 04:56:27.242]  Trump was very smart.
[04:56:27.282 --> 04:56:31.726]  He never fell for a lot of the traps, for a lot of the insults that Biden... Sure, so here's the issue.
[04:56:32.287 --> 04:56:36.851]  Conservatives can't get too excited about this win because now the next phase is beginning.
[04:56:38.075 --> 04:56:41.958]  Well, and that, here's the most immediate danger, and I think we can see this.
[04:56:42.559 --> 04:56:46.201]  On July 11th, they're going to put Donald Trump in jail.
[04:56:46.221 --> 04:56:47.682]  They're going to put him in jail.
[04:56:48.043 --> 04:56:55.909]  People say to me, lawyers particularly, oh, well, given the nonviolent nature of his offense, given the fact that he's a one time, no, forget all of that.
[04:56:56.209 --> 04:56:57.990]  There are different rules for Donald Trump.
[04:56:58.411 --> 04:57:05.016]  They're going to, they're going to incarcerate him, which I think actually is once again, overplaying their hand enormously.
[04:57:05.276 --> 04:57:07.818]  It will backfire, but they are so demented.
[04:57:08.098 --> 04:57:09.379]  They're so deranged.
[04:57:09.679 --> 04:57:14.661]  They are so driven insane by Donald Trump that they're going to do it.
[04:57:14.761 --> 04:57:18.402]  And I think it will backfire, and I think we will move a step further.
[04:57:18.422 --> 04:57:25.646]  Yeah, not to bring myself into this, but in federal court this morning, the Democrat Party representative in San Diego said, we don't want money.
[04:57:26.006 --> 04:57:27.366]  We want him shut down now.
[04:57:27.446 --> 04:57:28.607]  The judge said no again.
[04:57:29.287 --> 04:57:30.588]  Jones is trying to give you money.
[04:57:31.248 --> 04:57:33.409]  They don't, it's deranged.
[04:57:34.628 --> 04:57:35.428]  Yeah, they don't want money.
[04:57:35.468 --> 04:57:36.448]  They want to silence us.
[04:57:36.768 --> 04:57:37.869]  And that's what they did.
[04:57:37.889 --> 04:57:38.889]  They silenced Rumble.
[04:57:38.909 --> 04:57:45.270]  They shut down Rumble right before everyone was going to that particular platform to watch these particular debates.
[04:57:45.630 --> 04:57:48.971]  They made sure that the comments were turned off at the CNN live.
[04:57:49.011 --> 04:57:49.791]  Okay, I missed that.
[04:57:49.811 --> 04:57:50.991]  So they shut down Rumble?
[04:57:51.011 --> 04:57:53.171]  Because Elon Musk said he wouldn't let it shut down.
[04:57:53.551 --> 04:57:54.291]  They shut down Rumble?
[04:57:54.311 --> 04:57:54.812]  I didn't know that.
[04:57:55.672 --> 04:57:56.192]  Yeah, no, no.
[04:57:56.232 --> 04:57:57.572]  Rumble was down.
[04:57:57.592 --> 04:57:59.072]  We were about to make the transition.
[04:57:59.132 --> 04:58:01.313]  The debate started and then we were looking at our Rumble numbers.
[04:58:01.333 --> 04:58:02.133]  Oh yeah, that's what Steele said.
[04:58:02.153 --> 04:58:03.213]  Rumble went down tonight.
[04:58:04.116 --> 04:58:07.458]  Yeah, exactly, which was a major attack against free speech.
[04:58:07.498 --> 04:58:09.219]  There was major individuals on there.
[04:58:09.259 --> 04:58:09.959]  We were on there.
[04:58:09.999 --> 04:58:12.020]  Tim Poole did his first broadcast on there.
[04:58:12.080 --> 04:58:13.241]  Steven Crowder was on there.
[04:58:13.261 --> 04:58:20.284]  As soon as it went back up, they started to get significant numbers, but of course, they're not the same numbers as if they were able to be there from the very beginning.
[04:58:20.504 --> 04:58:23.446]  So there's a full-on attack against free speech.
[04:58:23.686 --> 04:58:39.374]  There's a full-on attack against the counter-narratives here because they have their script, they have their roles that they're playing right now, and they're very terrified about people questioning it and seeing the next step ahead of this, which is going to be more crazy, tumultuous actions moving forward.
[04:58:39.814 --> 04:58:44.177]  And I agree with Roger, they're kind of acting like a scared animal in a corner.
[04:58:44.857 --> 04:58:46.299]  Those animals freak out.
[04:58:46.379 --> 04:58:47.120]  They're panicking.
[04:58:47.140 --> 04:58:49.684]  That's what they want us to kind of perceive here.
[04:58:50.044 --> 04:59:02.279]  And I do think the next big upcoming political thing that is going to be happening is going to be the sentencing of Donald Trump in just a few days from now, where I think they're going to take the gloves off because they're... And they say they're going to put him in Rikers.
[04:59:02.360 --> 04:59:02.780]  I agree.
[04:59:02.820 --> 04:59:03.301]  But look at that.
[04:59:04.461 --> 04:59:07.702]  813,000, 814,000 live viewers.
[04:59:08.182 --> 04:59:15.963]  We have millions on our own channel, all just on X. So people want to put down, you know, Musk.
[04:59:16.404 --> 04:59:17.664]  It didn't go down like rumble.
[04:59:17.704 --> 04:59:18.404]  We love rumble.
[04:59:18.704 --> 04:59:20.344]  But look at that.
[04:59:20.364 --> 04:59:23.345]  814,000 viewers right now, Roger.
[04:59:23.905 --> 04:59:25.325]  Right now, Luke Grodowski.
[04:59:25.685 --> 04:59:27.406]  They are, what do you think of Musk?
[04:59:27.566 --> 04:59:29.026]  That is big right there.
[04:59:29.904 --> 04:59:30.744]  No, this is incredible.
[04:59:30.764 --> 04:59:35.006]  This is one of the few things standing in the way of this kind of controlled narrative.
[04:59:35.046 --> 04:59:39.328]  This is one of the reasons why they have to do so many of these tricks, why they have to be so underhanded.
[04:59:39.708 --> 04:59:44.450]  They are terrified of people just being able to speak to each other, and we have that.
[04:59:44.731 --> 04:59:47.812]  CNN told him a few days ago, you can't carry this.
[04:59:47.832 --> 04:59:48.832]  He goes, it's fair use.
[04:59:49.172 --> 04:59:58.176]  I mean, look, we have four feeds going, all combined, two million viewers right now watching, separate from everything, just on X. I mean, that is huge.
[04:59:58.216 --> 05:00:00.998]   CNN was threatening to sue I was on Glenn Beck Show three days ago.
[05:00:01.038 --> 05:00:02.118]  He just got the letter.
[05:00:01.977 --> 05:00:05.757]   to all the heads of independent media saying we're gonna take you guys down.
[05:00:05.757 --> 05:00:06.757]  We tested the waters.
[05:00:06.757 --> 05:00:08.997]  I was on Glenn Beck's show three days ago.
[05:00:08.997 --> 05:00:09.996]  He just got the letter.
[05:00:09.996 --> 05:00:13.597]  They said we'll sue you if you even play a clip.
[05:00:13.597 --> 05:00:16.797]  Yeah, it's not working.
[05:00:16.862 --> 05:00:18.985]  The whole censorship thing is not working.
[05:00:19.025 --> 05:00:21.388]  But it does not mean that they won't ratchet it down.
[05:00:21.448 --> 05:00:24.652]  By the way, if you look at your numbers at X Jones, they're going down.
[05:00:24.812 --> 05:00:26.274]  Everybody's numbers are going down.
[05:00:27.075 --> 05:00:29.558]  So the algorithms are starting to kick in.
[05:00:29.578 --> 05:00:31.621]  No, Roger, you're right.
[05:00:31.721 --> 05:00:36.345]   I've seen They're flagging us, but I mean, today it's not working.
[05:00:36.385 --> 05:00:36.765]  Put it up!
[05:00:37.005 --> 05:00:37.246]  No.
[05:00:37.786 --> 05:00:43.731]  Listen, Roger, 814,000 people are watching you right now on Exelon.
[05:00:44.251 --> 05:00:46.693]  So, yeah, I get they're dialing it down, but it ain't working.
[05:00:46.713 --> 05:00:47.334]  What do you say to that?
[05:00:48.094 --> 05:00:48.995]  What do you say to that?
[05:00:49.015 --> 05:00:49.615]  What do you say?
[05:00:49.876 --> 05:00:52.998]  We got five feeds up, two million viewers, one feed, 818,000 right now.
[05:00:53.018 --> 05:00:53.579]  What do you say to them?
[05:00:57.423 --> 05:01:00.166]  What I say to them is go to StoneZone.com right now.
[05:01:01.027 --> 05:01:02.749]  Now that's beautiful.
[05:01:03.029 --> 05:01:04.130]  StoneZone.com.
[05:01:04.390 --> 05:01:05.051]  You're right.
[05:01:05.091 --> 05:01:10.236]  We're seeing a major dial back on conservatives on X, but I talk to insiders.
[05:01:10.797 --> 05:01:16.703]  They have an army of bots, false flagging, and doing reports to suppress those numbers.
[05:01:18.075 --> 05:01:30.927]  Yeah, there's something definitely going on because this assault on me last week because I had the audacity to call for every legal and technical tool by the Republicans to ensure an honest election.
[05:01:31.307 --> 05:01:32.228]  That's what I actually said.
[05:01:32.608 --> 05:01:35.951]  The number of bots pumping that out on X really blew my mind.
[05:01:36.291 --> 05:01:42.437]  Oh yeah, saying that you said you'll steal the election and in the audio you say, if they try to steal it, we're going to block it.
[05:01:43.348 --> 05:01:47.750]  Yeah, it's crazy, but it's part of the same strategy, as you know.
[05:01:48.110 --> 05:01:51.551]  The same reason they're going after you, the same reason they're going after me.
[05:01:52.151 --> 05:01:54.032]  They thought they would take Tucker Carlson down.
[05:01:54.072 --> 05:01:55.232]  That didn't work out so well.
[05:01:55.512 --> 05:01:58.733]  They made him five times, ten times stronger than he was before.
[05:01:59.073 --> 05:02:00.394]  Because people want the truth.
[05:02:00.654 --> 05:02:01.834]  They have a hunger for the truth.
[05:02:02.074 --> 05:02:04.335]  They will find the truth if the truth is out there.
[05:02:04.355 --> 05:02:04.675]  Now it's 821,000.
[05:02:04.715 --> 05:02:05.896]  So let's talk about this right now.
[05:02:09.657 --> 05:02:10.678]  What is Trump going to do?
[05:02:10.718 --> 05:02:11.498]  You're his confidant.
[05:02:11.518 --> 05:02:12.279]  You never brag about it.
[05:02:12.299 --> 05:02:13.119]  You don't kiss and tell.
[05:02:13.560 --> 05:02:16.041]  But they are in full panic mode with 130 days left.
[05:02:16.361 --> 05:02:17.142]  What's going to happen next?
[05:02:17.182 --> 05:02:18.242]  Roger Stone, Luke Gronowski.
[05:02:20.464 --> 05:02:24.907]  Well, clearly the next big event is this sentencing.
[05:02:25.687 --> 05:02:27.588]  I think they're going to overplay their hands.
[05:02:27.648 --> 05:02:38.595]  So if they send him to Rikers Island, which I think would be an enormous mistake, that really will, I think, hamper his ability to even appear virally at the convention to accept the nomination.
[05:02:39.230 --> 05:02:51.135]  If they lock him up in Trump Tower and say they put an ankle bracelet on him, the campaign will be out selling Donald Trump 2024 ankle bracelets within 48 hours and they will sell out of them.
[05:02:51.475 --> 05:02:55.257]  I mean, this is a political realignment that is coming.
[05:02:56.077 --> 05:02:58.798]  My greater concern is the A-word.
[05:02:59.078 --> 05:03:02.520]  Tucker Carlson, probably the first major figure in the country.
[05:03:02.880 --> 05:03:07.442]  Look, one of the earliest things I did in politics was to write a book on the assassination of John F. Kennedy.
[05:03:07.942 --> 05:03:12.404]  If they killed Kennedy, and they did, there's no question about that when I say they.
[05:03:12.424 --> 05:03:14.344]  Yeah, but we're not 1963.
[05:03:14.384 --> 05:03:15.545]  This ain't gonna fly.
[05:03:16.765 --> 05:03:18.306]  Well, it doesn't mean they won't try, though.
[05:03:19.106 --> 05:03:20.946]  Do you agree that they're crazy enough to try?
[05:03:20.986 --> 05:03:21.847]  No, no, I agree with you.
[05:03:21.907 --> 05:03:23.887]  I'm just saying we ain't 1963.
[05:03:25.468 --> 05:03:37.212]  No, but I guess what I'm saying here is they understand, and it's not about revenge, but when people were involved in treasonous activity, for example, John Brennan is shitting his pants right now.
[05:03:37.876 --> 05:03:40.178]  I mean, he is worse than Joe Biden.
[05:03:40.458 --> 05:03:41.559]  Yeah, don't they get it?
[05:03:41.619 --> 05:03:42.800]  I'm going to start over.
[05:03:42.820 --> 05:03:43.720]  I want you on the floor.
[05:03:44.281 --> 05:03:45.562]  This is bigger than Trump.
[05:03:45.862 --> 05:03:48.324]  Don't they get no matter what they do with Trump, we're awake now?
[05:03:48.364 --> 05:03:51.506]  There's no putting the genie back in the bottle, or as you like to say, toothpaste back in the tube.
[05:03:52.987 --> 05:03:55.750]  They don't, they don't understand that because they don't understand.
[05:03:55.850 --> 05:04:00.733]  They think this populist, this nationalist revolution is all about one man.
[05:04:00.793 --> 05:04:01.934]  It's not about one man.
[05:04:02.415 --> 05:04:03.635]  I mean, one man is leading it.
[05:04:03.736 --> 05:04:04.676]  One man made it possible.
[05:04:04.696 --> 05:04:05.557]  He's a focal point.
[05:04:06.559 --> 05:04:15.329]  Yeah, and he made it possible without any question, without his name identification, without his courage, without his bravado, this never would have happened.
[05:04:15.609 --> 05:04:18.872]  But the movement will go on past him at some point.
[05:04:18.973 --> 05:04:19.934]  They do not understand.
[05:04:19.954 --> 05:04:22.076]  Even bigger if they put him in jail or kill him.
[05:04:23.095 --> 05:04:26.996]  Well, but that's why they waited until the fourth year of Biden's presidency.
[05:04:27.236 --> 05:04:33.638]  You see, they thought that their stooge, Ron DeSantis, or their stooge, Nikki Haley, would beat him for the nomination.
[05:04:33.658 --> 05:04:35.339]  Then everything would go back to the way it was.
[05:04:35.539 --> 05:04:38.720]  We had the Bush-Clinton, you know, divide.
[05:04:39.160 --> 05:04:40.621]  Heads I win, tails you lose.
[05:04:41.441 --> 05:04:43.642]  It's never going to go back that way again, ever.
[05:04:43.782 --> 05:04:44.842]  They don't understand that.
[05:04:44.882 --> 05:04:45.582]  That's right.
[05:04:45.622 --> 05:04:46.763]  Their system's over.
[05:04:46.903 --> 05:04:48.003]  So what comes next?
[05:04:48.952 --> 05:05:00.176]  I still think they're going to be very desperate to try to take control of the narrative of the conversation, and they could do that through, I think, deliberate attempts to try to provoke people to be angry, to be violent.
[05:05:00.236 --> 05:05:01.456]  I think they're going to keep pushing.
[05:05:01.496 --> 05:05:08.438]  I think they're going to keep pressuring, and they're going to try to get the American people to overreact or to act violently.
[05:05:09.119 --> 05:05:13.580]  I think there's larger possibilities of things like Operation Gladio kind of playing up.
[05:05:14.020 --> 05:05:26.043]  As well as this administration, the Biden administration, ratcheting up tensions all over the world, especially when it comes to a lot of these foreign conflicts that are unfolding in Ukraine, potentially soon also in Lebanon.
[05:05:26.063 --> 05:05:27.904]  We just got very troubling news from the U.S.
[05:05:27.924 --> 05:05:32.205]  State Department that's trying to get American citizens out of Lebanon just a couple hours ago.
[05:05:32.385 --> 05:05:33.625]  That's right, Luke, you're right.
[05:05:33.645 --> 05:05:38.106]  The answer, when tyrants are in trouble, as Gero Salente says, they take you to war.
[05:05:38.146 --> 05:05:38.886]  Let's speak to that.
[05:05:39.226 --> 05:05:46.150]   So instead of, as the Wolf said, I said this five times, We can't start celebrating yet because the enemy's going to come down with both feet.
[05:05:46.290 --> 05:05:50.133]  Luke Rodowski, Roger Stone, what does the deep state do now?
[05:05:51.934 --> 05:05:54.816]  Assassination or world war, probably in the other order.
[05:05:55.016 --> 05:06:02.841]  So they have the demented idea that if we go to war, that perhaps the in party, that they will rally around Biden.
[05:06:02.981 --> 05:06:03.902]  I think Biden's cooked.
[05:06:04.830 --> 05:06:30.291]   I think now, what happens backstage here is Barack Obama goes to him, he has a letter co-signed by a majority of the cabinet members, he's got Kamala Harris on board, and they say, We're going to take you out right now, in which case you will lose your ability to pardon your son, your brother, other members of the Biden crime family, or you can go quietly and just announce that you're not running for re-election.
[05:06:30.651 --> 05:06:32.913]  We'll let you stay there through the end of your term.
[05:06:33.194 --> 05:06:37.117]  We'll make sure your son doesn't go to prison and they'll replace him.
[05:06:37.577 --> 05:06:39.699]  Then he releases his delegates.
[05:06:40.439 --> 05:06:45.603]  We have a runaway Democratic National Convention, which nominates Michelle Obama.
[05:06:45.664 --> 05:06:48.446]  Yes, I've been saying it for three plus years.
[05:06:49.126 --> 05:06:50.207]  Let's elaborate on that.
[05:06:50.267 --> 05:06:52.087]  You have been calling that and now it's happening.
[05:06:53.948 --> 05:06:55.869]  Look, it's kind of obvious.
[05:06:56.029 --> 05:06:57.249]  She carries no baggage.
[05:06:57.469 --> 05:07:00.990]  She's the most popular Democrat in the country who's eligible.
[05:07:01.370 --> 05:07:06.752]  Her husband cannot run again because he served two terms, although this would technically be his fourth term.
[05:07:07.092 --> 05:07:08.813]  They can put together the money quickly.
[05:07:08.893 --> 05:07:16.836]  They can certainly galvanize the majority of the cabinet members in order to enact the 25th Amendment, which is what it requires.
[05:07:17.476 --> 05:07:24.723]  And if that doesn't work, then yes, I pray every single day for the physical safety of Donald Trump and his family.
[05:07:24.864 --> 05:07:26.645]  Well, we were just talking about this before.
[05:07:26.745 --> 05:07:34.493]  There was a very interesting article by Axios just released today, specifically talking about how Michelle Obama really isn't happy with Joe Biden.
[05:07:34.873 --> 05:07:44.160]  So that is, again, planting the seeds, planting these larger stories that, of course, haven't in people's minds as they've been kind of suggesting this for a while.
[05:07:44.240 --> 05:07:45.842]  And again, they've been testing the waters.
[05:07:46.102 --> 05:07:49.565]  The corporate media, they're not any kind of news organizations.
[05:07:49.605 --> 05:07:56.530]  They're a vessel for the intelligentsia, for the deep state, for the sociopathic pedophiles out there that truly do call the shots.
[05:07:56.790 --> 05:08:03.898]  They are their PR management firm and they're the ones implanting a lot of these ideas and I think I agree with Roger.
[05:08:04.038 --> 05:08:07.202]  A lot of people right now are talking about Newsome potentially replacing him.
[05:08:07.462 --> 05:08:08.824]  He's at the debates right now.
[05:08:08.904 --> 05:08:10.305]  He's talking to a lot of the media.
[05:08:10.345 --> 05:08:13.068]  He's talking about potentially even stepping up if he needs to.
[05:08:13.649 --> 05:08:16.830]  But clearly there is going to be a major shift here.
[05:08:17.310 --> 05:08:20.811]  And I think Joe Biden was trying to hold on as much as he could.
[05:08:20.891 --> 05:08:26.293]  And I think it's not a coincidence that this debate is as late as it is in the political cycle as it is now.
[05:08:26.733 --> 05:08:29.194]  Usually they're kind of right before the elections.
[05:08:29.534 --> 05:08:31.775]  This one's 130 days out.
[05:08:32.055 --> 05:08:33.796]  That's not a coincidence there, in my opinion.
[05:08:34.076 --> 05:08:46.943]  And I think this, along with the coordinated kind of CNN-controlled demolition of the Biden administration, highlights this shift, which is pretty clear, pretty apparent, and it's going to be playing in the kind of playbook where they want it to go.
[05:08:46.963 --> 05:08:51.245]   The other thing, Alex, is kind of obvious in that is, Keep an eye on Hilda Beast.
[05:08:51.625 --> 05:08:52.806]  She's gonna make her move now.
[05:08:53.206 --> 05:08:54.227]  She has a new book out.
[05:08:54.647 --> 05:08:56.268]  Great picture of her on the cover.
[05:08:56.308 --> 05:08:57.148]  Yeah, so wait a minute.
[05:08:57.429 --> 05:08:59.650]  You're saying it's Big Mike, but people are saying Hillary.
[05:09:00.461 --> 05:09:05.685]  Well, because I think Hillary says she maneuvers her way into the vice presidency.
[05:09:05.705 --> 05:09:08.087]  She says she replaces Kamala.
[05:09:08.147 --> 05:09:12.910]  So if they take Michelle as the nominee, can't have two women of color on the table.
[05:09:13.270 --> 05:09:15.432]  So they have to have somebody who's right.
[05:09:15.952 --> 05:09:22.637]  That would be Gavin Newsom, but Hillary Clinton, who's still smarting over the beating that she took from Donald Trump.
[05:09:22.657 --> 05:09:26.680]  So you're saying it's going to be Big Mike with Hillary?
[05:09:27.569 --> 05:09:27.829]  Right.
[05:09:28.269 --> 05:09:31.111]  And then, who knows, does she get Arkansas-ed?
[05:09:31.171 --> 05:09:32.692]  I mean, I think it's entirely possible.
[05:09:33.313 --> 05:09:37.815]  I don't care who you are, no one person knows 56 people who committed suicide.
[05:09:38.035 --> 05:09:38.836]  No one person.
[05:09:38.896 --> 05:09:39.296]  Absolutely.
[05:09:39.356 --> 05:09:47.801]  And then the Wall Street Journal had a very interesting article in an op-ed piece suggesting that Biden should replace Kamala with Hillary Clinton.
[05:09:48.242 --> 05:09:53.325]  They openly wrote about this stuff as, of course, they were openly saying it.
[05:09:54.646 --> 05:10:01.251]  So do you think the Democrats on CNN calling for the end of Biden even were giving the script before or giving it right when he lost the debate?
[05:10:03.092 --> 05:10:05.254]  My guess is that it was a contingent move.
[05:10:05.294 --> 05:10:09.257]  In other words, it was kind of, if Joe is as bad as we think he's going to be, jump on this.
[05:10:10.013 --> 05:10:15.595]  Uh, and, uh, I suspect that he, that he, uh... Yeah, because we know they're totally modified for it.
[05:10:15.615 --> 05:10:16.335]  They do what they're told.
[05:10:16.635 --> 05:10:24.078]  They literally, like, piranhas or flies on shit, attacked within seconds, like, viciously.
[05:10:25.413 --> 05:10:31.814]  Well, because they understand that if Trump gets back into power, it's not about revenge.
[05:10:31.834 --> 05:10:34.895]  There was a treasonous coup that was attempted in this country.
[05:10:35.895 --> 05:10:36.515]  They failed.
[05:10:36.855 --> 05:10:39.036]  But those people are going to have to face justice.
[05:10:40.276 --> 05:10:42.997]  That's why they've been out there with this whole revenge.
[05:10:43.137 --> 05:10:44.377]  Are you going to take revenge?
[05:10:44.977 --> 05:10:47.197]  No, what we're going to have is equal protection of the law.
[05:10:47.217 --> 05:10:48.638]  Well, we've got to remove the coup.
[05:10:48.658 --> 05:10:49.558]  We've got to remove the coup.
[05:10:50.797 --> 05:11:00.183]  Yes, but those who staged the coup, John Brennan, James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Barack Obama.
[05:11:00.223 --> 05:11:05.867]  Remember, this plot was born in the Oval Office under Barack Obama.
[05:11:05.907 --> 05:11:13.392]  It's kind of funny that when the judge in Florida does an honest job, she's attacked because she was a Trump appointee.
[05:11:13.432 --> 05:11:28.263]   Well, I went before a judge, General Flynn went before a judge, Paul Manafort went before a judge, George Papadopoulos went before a judge, Carter Page went before a judge, all a judge appointed by Barack Obama, but the left had no problem with that whatsoever.
[05:11:28.323 --> 05:11:28.903]  It's interesting.
[05:11:29.364 --> 05:11:29.904]  Great point.
[05:11:29.944 --> 05:11:38.091]  Closing comments from Roger Stone and Luke Hradowski before Owen Schroyer and Chase Geyser take over.
[05:11:38.111 --> 05:11:40.213]  We have a huge audience, millions.
[05:11:40.793 --> 05:11:41.754]  Extra, tune in right now.
[05:11:43.556 --> 05:11:45.576]  This was a historic night.
[05:11:46.176 --> 05:11:47.857]  Again, people shouldn't be celebrating.
[05:11:47.897 --> 05:11:54.738]  People should be absolutely concerned, especially when the corporate media keeps regurgitating the same talking points all at once, all at the same time.
[05:11:55.118 --> 05:11:56.238]  Something is afoot here.
[05:11:56.358 --> 05:11:57.078]  Something is up.
[05:11:57.298 --> 05:11:57.998]  Be prepared.
[05:11:58.078 --> 05:12:00.559]  Strap in because it's going to be a wild ride.
[05:12:00.819 --> 05:12:01.779]  We had an incredible show.
[05:12:01.799 --> 05:12:04.600]  We literally watched the entire presidential debates.
[05:12:04.660 --> 05:12:06.680]  Roger Stone was giving us his commentary during it.
[05:12:07.040 --> 05:12:10.561]  Check it out right now on Rumble.com forward slash WeAreChange.
[05:12:10.621 --> 05:12:12.721]  WeAreChange.org is the website.
[05:12:13.361 --> 05:12:16.944]  And, of course, we do live streams and podcasts now.
[05:12:16.964 --> 05:12:18.285]  We got another show 4 p.m.
[05:12:18.425 --> 05:12:19.386]  Eastern tomorrow.
[05:12:19.426 --> 05:12:22.468]  Tune in for that on rumble.com forward slash we are change.
[05:12:22.508 --> 05:12:23.689]  Roger, again, pleasure.
[05:12:24.469 --> 05:12:27.472]  I'm very lucky to have you here in studio.
[05:12:27.572 --> 05:12:29.333]  And again, prophetic stuff.
[05:12:29.473 --> 05:12:30.414]  You've called it.
[05:12:30.774 --> 05:12:31.354]  It's happening.
[05:12:32.055 --> 05:12:35.578]  And you truly have your pulse on what's really happening here in America.
[05:12:35.658 --> 05:12:37.479]  And it's shocking how much you do.
[05:12:37.779 --> 05:12:38.920]  But Alex, let me thank you.
[05:12:39.521 --> 05:12:41.163]  Alex, let me thank you for having us on.
[05:12:41.203 --> 05:12:44.606]  Give us an opportunity to take a little victory lap at least.
[05:12:45.247 --> 05:12:46.168]  But you're absolutely right.
[05:12:46.288 --> 05:12:50.872]  Now, like a cornered animal, the deep state is more dangerous than it has ever been.
[05:12:50.893 --> 05:12:56.718]  And we will not let Donald Trump ascend to the presidency peacefully.
[05:12:57.319 --> 05:12:59.041]  They are the ones who will use violence.
[05:12:59.401 --> 05:13:01.762]  They are the ones who are capable of a false flag.
[05:13:02.103 --> 05:13:04.244]  They are the ones who will violate the Constitution.
[05:13:04.624 --> 05:13:06.925]  They are the ones who are a danger to democracy.
[05:13:06.945 --> 05:13:08.326]  These are very dangerous times.
[05:13:08.346 --> 05:13:08.746]  Well, that's right.
[05:13:08.766 --> 05:13:09.827]  In closing, I'll say this.
[05:13:10.347 --> 05:13:11.288]  We're all very humble.
[05:13:11.968 --> 05:13:12.969]  I'm on a power trip.
[05:13:13.249 --> 05:13:14.270]  I'm very blessed to be here.
[05:13:15.050 --> 05:13:30.957]   We probably have, no exaggeration, regular show four or five million a day, at night on a Thursday at 11 We have millions on InfoWars, millions on X, millions everywhere of new listeners.
[05:13:31.437 --> 05:13:33.318]  The corporate media doesn't even have that.
[05:13:33.398 --> 05:13:35.299]  So we have to realize they're done.
[05:13:35.779 --> 05:13:39.040]  And so the good news is humanity has awakened.
[05:13:39.100 --> 05:13:53.604]   And if all these viewers and listeners just take this show, once it's archived at Real Alex Jones, or they just take it once it's at Band.Video or InfoWars.com where it's a show, or they go to StoneZone.com or to Luke's site, if they just promote People tell them the truth.
[05:13:53.664 --> 05:13:54.165]  It's game over.
[05:13:54.205 --> 05:13:56.607]  So both of you tell folks how people find you.
[05:13:58.990 --> 05:14:00.792]  Rumble.com forward slash we are change.
[05:14:00.932 --> 05:14:02.634]  We are change.org is the website.
[05:14:03.075 --> 05:14:04.336]  And thank you, Alex.
[05:14:04.356 --> 05:14:06.698]  Thank you so much for being the platform.
[05:14:07.059 --> 05:14:08.701]  You're at the tip of the spear.
[05:14:08.921 --> 05:14:12.044]  They're attacking you directly and they're doing it for a very specific reason.
[05:14:12.064 --> 05:14:13.566]  So thank you so much for having us on.
[05:14:13.646 --> 05:14:15.687]  Alex, thank you so much for having us.
[05:14:15.767 --> 05:14:18.027]  It was a great night for democracy.
[05:14:18.047 --> 05:14:19.728]  It was a great night for the Constitution.
[05:14:19.768 --> 05:14:21.188]  It was a great night for freedom.
[05:14:21.007 --> 05:14:27.287]  They can go to wabcradio.com every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[05:14:27.287 --> 05:14:30.147]  Eastern, but can be heard worldwide.
[05:14:30.147 --> 05:14:32.827]  And of course, thestonezone.com where you can find it all.
[05:14:32.827 --> 05:14:34.946]  Alex, thank you so much for having us.
[05:14:34.946 --> 05:14:36.426]  It was a great night for democracy.
[05:14:36.426 --> 05:14:38.386]  It was a great night for the Constitution.
[05:14:38.386 --> 05:14:40.267]  It was a great night for freedom.
[05:14:40.267 --> 05:14:42.787]  I can't wait to call the big guy and congratulate him.
[05:14:42.787 --> 05:14:44.226]  Yeah, please come on tomorrow.
[05:14:44.255 --> 05:14:45.736]  In fact, both of you tomorrow.
[05:14:46.877 --> 05:14:47.518]  We call you.
[05:14:47.578 --> 05:14:48.218]  Come on tomorrow.
[05:14:48.278 --> 05:14:48.899]  Big show.
[05:14:49.439 --> 05:14:50.560]  Just a few hours from now.
[05:14:50.600 --> 05:14:51.061]  Tomorrow.
[05:14:51.241 --> 05:14:52.282]  Both of you come on tomorrow.
[05:14:52.302 --> 05:14:53.803]  In fact, crew, talk to them.
[05:14:53.863 --> 05:14:54.583]  Get them on tomorrow.
[05:14:55.324 --> 05:14:55.964]  Look, guys.
[05:14:57.426 --> 05:14:58.947]  This is a war against tyranny.
[05:15:00.208 --> 05:15:05.312]  And I see God come through over and over and over again in these fights.
[05:15:06.833 --> 05:15:08.614]  Evil isn't the only power in the universe.
[05:15:09.475 --> 05:15:10.496]  There is good as well.
[05:15:12.230 --> 05:15:18.035]  And so, I'm just asking all of you to realize the amazing things we're doing together.
[05:15:19.075 --> 05:15:22.498]  And to see the fact that we don't have to roll over and be slaves.
[05:15:23.639 --> 05:15:24.800]  And to just support us.
[05:15:25.380 --> 05:15:27.842]  To take the articles, the videos, the clips, and share them.
[05:15:28.103 --> 05:15:30.164]  Which a lot of you are doing, but others aren't.
[05:15:31.986 --> 05:15:38.751]  I know that less than 1% of our viewers and listeners ever buy a product at Infolwerestore.com.
[05:15:40.606 --> 05:15:41.927]  Or at drjonesnaturals.com.
[05:15:42.007 --> 05:15:44.009]  And I'm not mad at you.
[05:15:44.369 --> 05:15:49.933]  I'm like, why are you missing this opportunity to get a great product and fund people that are dedicated to death?
[05:15:50.713 --> 05:15:52.094]  Like, you can put a gun to my head.
[05:15:52.354 --> 05:16:00.020]  The new order can walk in here today and they can put a gun to my head and say, Jones, you better back off.
[05:16:00.420 --> 05:16:01.581]  You better shut up.
[05:16:01.921 --> 05:16:03.803]  You better go away or we're going to kill your ass.
[05:16:04.143 --> 05:16:06.545]  And I tell them, pull that trigger.
[05:16:06.565 --> 05:16:08.486]  Because I'm not for sale.
[05:16:09.321 --> 05:16:11.903]  But I can't fight the tyrants without you.
[05:16:12.944 --> 05:16:19.811]  So go to dotterjonesnationals.com right now and support the broadcast because we cannot do this.
[05:16:19.831 --> 05:16:21.552]  Am I centering the camera?
[05:16:21.813 --> 05:16:23.154]  I'm just thinking about if I'm centering the camera.
[05:16:23.875 --> 05:16:24.495]  Where do I center?
[05:16:24.535 --> 05:16:24.835]  Over here?
[05:16:24.855 --> 05:16:26.657]  Am I centered yet?
[05:16:26.757 --> 05:16:27.098]  There we go.
[05:16:29.300 --> 05:16:30.881]  So that's where we are.
[05:16:31.061 --> 05:16:32.342]  I mean, I hate tyrants.
[05:16:32.463 --> 05:16:33.383]  I hate pedophiles.
[05:16:33.443 --> 05:16:34.284]  I hate Satanists.
[05:16:34.364 --> 05:16:35.105]  I hate globalists.
[05:16:36.067 --> 05:16:38.108]  But I can't do this without you.
[05:16:38.128 --> 05:16:40.410]  And I'm just saying, I will fight to the death.
[05:16:41.010 --> 05:16:41.951]  I won't back down.
[05:16:42.011 --> 05:16:42.832]  I'll never stop.
[05:16:42.992 --> 05:16:43.892]  I'll interview everybody.
[05:16:44.012 --> 05:16:49.816]  I'll go 110 miles an hour through traffic, but I need you to back me.
[05:16:50.717 --> 05:16:51.297]  It's that simple.

[05:17:13.277 --> 05:17:14.397]  We haven't taken the comments yet.
[05:17:14.417 --> 05:17:15.578]  We did some in the first hour.
[05:17:15.598 --> 05:17:20.820]  They're about to host, and we have millions of precious people.
[05:17:21.120 --> 05:17:26.602]  If I had a crowd of 50 people right now, I was talking to, I would just spend hours talking to them.
[05:17:27.782 --> 05:17:29.203]  We have millions of people.
[05:17:30.203 --> 05:17:31.343]  CNN doesn't have that.
[05:17:31.744 --> 05:17:32.924]  ABC doesn't have that.
[05:17:33.384 --> 05:17:34.485]  NBC doesn't have that.
[05:17:34.845 --> 05:17:36.025]  CBS doesn't have that.
[05:17:36.485 --> 05:17:37.546]  NPR doesn't have that.
[05:17:37.946 --> 05:17:40.827]  We, I don't take it as like, oh, I'm this big badass.
[05:17:40.887 --> 05:17:41.827]  I got billions of viewers.
[05:17:42.768 --> 05:17:45.108]  We are reaching millions of new people.
[05:17:45.168 --> 05:17:49.450]  And if you just decide to take the feed from InfoWars.com slash show.
[05:17:51.275 --> 05:17:57.460]  If you decide to go get a vitamin or a mineral product or something at drjonesanddrills.com, you change the world.
[05:17:57.540 --> 05:18:00.543]  It's your decisions that change the world.

[05:18:10.171 --> 05:18:13.633]  I'll be back here at like 9 a.m.
[05:18:13.673 --> 05:18:14.034]  tomorrow.
[05:18:14.674 --> 05:18:16.996]  I'll be on air at 11 a.m.
[05:18:17.136 --> 05:18:20.780]   God willing, but Everybody's gonna freak out if they're successful shutting us down.
[05:18:20.800 --> 05:18:21.300]  They may be.
[05:18:22.140 --> 05:18:23.760]  Like, God, he wasn't making that up.
[05:18:24.380 --> 05:18:27.421]  You think all this big, long, drawn-out fight's some act?
[05:18:27.501 --> 05:18:28.761]  This is a fight, man.
[05:18:29.542 --> 05:18:31.062]  This is what a fight looks like.
[05:18:31.382 --> 05:18:32.302]  We're hard to kill.
[05:18:32.322 --> 05:18:33.442]  We're hard to shut down.
[05:18:33.482 --> 05:18:34.563]  We got God on our side.
[05:18:35.583 --> 05:18:37.403]  But we're so close to being shut down.
[05:18:37.443 --> 05:18:41.904]  We need your prayer and your support right now at drjonesnaturals.com.
[05:18:42.724 --> 05:18:43.425]  I thank you all.
[05:18:43.965 --> 05:18:44.885]  All right, Owen Schroeder.
[05:18:45.781 --> 05:18:48.581]  And Chase Geyser, take over now.
[05:18:48.581 --> 05:19:00.581]   And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say,
[05:19:00.581 --> 05:19:03.941]   "I don't know what's gonna happen at the end of this, but you wanna fight?"
[05:19:04.047 --> 05:19:06.168]  You better believe you've got one!
[05:19:08.129 --> 05:19:13.728]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[05:19:31.728 --> 05:19:38.728]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[05:19:38.728 --> 05:19:40.728]  [cheering]

[05:20:32.271 --> 05:20:34.271]  That's right, never give up the fight.
[05:20:34.271 --> 05:20:36.271]  [beatboxing]
[05:20:36.244 --> 05:20:41.967]  Or as it was once said, the hardest enemy, the hardest opponent to beat is the one that never gives up.
[05:20:42.848 --> 05:20:44.209]  The one that never stops fighting.
[05:20:45.854 --> 05:20:48.917]  That's what this movement is all about.
[05:20:50.238 --> 05:21:00.485]  And right now it's Donald Trump really making his claim to be the leader of that movement tonight with this massive debate victory.
[05:21:00.505 --> 05:21:04.449]  All right, here's what we've got now back in the InfoWars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[05:21:04.489 --> 05:21:10.053]  Owen Schroer, Chase Geyser live with you live on X at InfoWars at Real Alex Jones.
[05:21:11.021 --> 05:21:16.063]  Live on the Rumble, InfoWars feed, and of course live at Band.Video.
[05:21:16.383 --> 05:21:22.967]  And just by the sheer numbers that we have tonight, it shows that there's a lot of interest in tonight's debate.
[05:21:23.567 --> 05:21:24.507]  So here's what we're going to do.
[05:21:25.868 --> 05:21:30.690]  We've got some developments since the debate that Chase and I are going to be going over.
[05:21:30.790 --> 05:21:34.632]  We're also going to be just kind of recapping what was seen tonight in the debate.
[05:21:35.132 --> 05:21:36.833]  But here's some major developments.
[05:21:37.739 --> 05:21:39.100]  Since the debate has concluded.
[05:21:39.560 --> 05:21:42.563]  The betting odds for Joe Biden are tanking.
[05:21:43.423 --> 05:21:48.507]  And Gavin Newsom has gained the most in this short time since the conclusion of the debate.
[05:21:48.888 --> 05:21:51.409]  All the attention also seems to be on Gavin Newsom.
[05:21:51.670 --> 05:21:56.714]  The media following him around, asking him if he's going to step up, that seems to be the story.
[05:21:57.114 --> 05:22:03.719]  And so when your top story, if you're the Democrat Party, is who you're going to place your current candidate with, I think you're in trouble.
[05:22:04.389 --> 05:22:06.751]  MSNBC has turned on Biden.
[05:22:07.091 --> 05:22:09.252]  CNN has turned on Biden.
[05:22:10.133 --> 05:22:16.376]  They did a question of black voters on, I think it was CNN or MSNBC, they said, did you vote for Biden?
[05:22:16.396 --> 05:22:16.917]  They raised their hand.
[05:22:16.937 --> 05:22:18.137]  They said, are you going to vote for Biden again?
[05:22:18.177 --> 05:22:18.858]  They dropped their hand.
[05:22:19.498 --> 05:22:20.379]  So this is where we're at.
[05:22:20.419 --> 05:22:30.625]  We've also got a video of Joe Biden after the debate needing escorted off the stage by Jill.
[05:22:32.276 --> 05:22:35.758]  He needed escorted off the debate stage by Jill.
[05:22:35.959 --> 05:22:42.243]  He's standing at the podium, dazed and confused, and Jill has to come escort him off the stage.
[05:22:42.383 --> 05:22:47.066]  So it's just, it's even worse than it looked, if you can believe that.
[05:22:48.327 --> 05:22:52.630]  And then we've got Trump post-debate in his campaign room.
[05:22:53.230 --> 05:23:01.153]   You've got Jill Biden trying to rally energy behind Joe in the post- Debate room as well, in embarrassing fashion.
[05:23:01.714 --> 05:23:03.555]  We've got all of these things coming up for you.
[05:23:03.635 --> 05:23:09.160]  Now, here's kind of my highlights, and then we'll get the highlights from Chase in studio with me.
[05:23:09.440 --> 05:23:12.622]  Oh, by the way, top of drudge also saying disaster for Biden.
[05:23:12.642 --> 05:23:13.423]  He's going to be replaced.
[05:23:15.344 --> 05:23:24.271]  I think that this was either a deliberate setup to have Joe Biden fail, or they were just giving Joe Biden a chance.
[05:23:24.832 --> 05:23:27.234]  And they were saying, look, we'll give you a chance.
[05:23:28.217 --> 05:23:36.960]  If you can go out there and have this debate before the official nomination, before the official convention in August, then we'll move forward with you.
[05:23:37.080 --> 05:23:39.440]  If not, whether this was discussed or not, I don't know.
[05:23:39.460 --> 05:23:40.901]  But it seems like that's kind of the deal.
[05:23:41.041 --> 05:23:46.982]  This was either intentional sabotage or they're basically giving him the opportunity.
[05:23:49.023 --> 05:23:52.164]  I mean, really, I guess it doesn't matter, Chase, because the result is the same.
[05:23:52.744 --> 05:23:53.384]  I agree with you.
[05:23:53.664 --> 05:23:57.937]   And there's a couple of things to consider when Wondering whether or not this is a sabotage.
[05:23:57.958 --> 05:24:03.259]  First of all, it's abundantly obvious that whatever happened tonight was deliberate.
[05:24:03.319 --> 05:24:06.120]  It's just what the motive was and what the thinking was.
[05:24:06.180 --> 05:24:09.021]  So we know that this debate was somewhat rigged.
[05:24:09.061 --> 05:24:13.062]  All the questions were very obviously favoring Joe Biden.
[05:24:13.282 --> 05:24:18.404]  All of the classic CNN stuff that we thought they were going to do against Trump, they did.
[05:24:18.444 --> 05:24:20.345]  They didn't give him the opportunity to follow up.
[05:24:20.385 --> 05:24:22.185]  They gave more time to Biden.
[05:24:22.585 --> 05:24:30.248]   But at the same time, in hindsight now, It seems to me like basically they handed it to Biden on a platter.
[05:24:31.196 --> 05:24:36.039]  Knowing that he would prove incapable, even if it was handed to him on a platter.
[05:24:36.379 --> 05:24:37.640]  So they don't look like they betrayed him.
[05:24:37.660 --> 05:24:43.123]  CNN doesn't look like it betrayed him because it was obviously rigged in Biden's favor, but he couldn't even handle that.
[05:24:43.203 --> 05:24:47.325]  I think they knew this was going to happen and they just needed that excuse to replace him.
[05:24:47.726 --> 05:24:51.928]  And one thing that I did notice was interesting is I follow Harry Sisson quite a bit because he just drives me nuts.
[05:24:52.068 --> 05:25:00.113]  I know he's not that big, but Sisson is like one of the only people coming out and talking about how Biden won the debate and how amazing it was.
[05:25:00.473 --> 05:25:08.256]  So now what we're seeing on social media, now what we're seeing is who's paid by the Biden campaign directly versus who's paid by the party directly.
[05:25:08.729 --> 05:25:08.949]  Right?
[05:25:09.389 --> 05:25:12.951]  And so the only people supporting Biden now are the ones that are funded by the campaign.
[05:25:12.991 --> 05:25:14.172]  The entire party flipped on him.
[05:25:14.192 --> 05:25:27.920]  And the fact they all flipped on him at the same time, in the same way, consistently across all these legacy media platforms, which we know are just one conglomeration of media, indicates to me that they planned to flip on him before the debate and they got the green light after he proved himself a disaster.
[05:25:28.200 --> 05:25:35.144]  If you're a Democrat loyalist or a Democrat media loyalist, and they do exist, it's hard to believe, but there are some out there.
[05:25:36.536 --> 05:25:39.298]  Can you imagine how dazed and confused you must be right now?
[05:25:39.978 --> 05:25:42.760]  Because this is the same media that's been propping Joe Biden up.
[05:25:43.261 --> 05:25:49.125]  This is the same media that's been telling you that Joe Biden is the best candidate ever, how fit he is, his age, his advantage, and all this stuff.
[05:25:49.736 --> 05:25:57.420]  And then in one fell swoop, they witnessed the total devastation and the entire media turns against him and says, okay, it's a disaster.
[05:25:57.541 --> 05:25:58.901]  Everything we've told you is a lie.
[05:25:59.021 --> 05:26:00.442]  And that whole cheap fake narrative.
[05:26:00.802 --> 05:26:02.704]  I mean, how do they weasel their way out of that?
[05:26:02.764 --> 05:26:06.786]  So, but whatever, I guess if you're a Democrat voter, you're probably living in a life of confusion.
[05:26:07.006 --> 05:26:08.947]  You're lost in a world that doesn't exist already.
[05:26:09.728 --> 05:26:17.232]  I think that Trump addressed one thing and he kind of tried to lean into it, but kind of hinted at it when he was talking about abortion.
[05:26:17.998 --> 05:26:23.627]  And he kind of talks about how he's, you know, moving more towards the center policy-wise on abortion.
[05:26:23.967 --> 05:26:24.168]  Yeah.
[05:26:24.288 --> 05:26:30.357]  And this is the same thing he did on that podcast, that billionaire podcast the other day, and people started freaking out about the green card thing.
[05:26:30.998 --> 05:26:32.901]  And I'm sitting here saying, hold on a second.
[05:26:33.442 --> 05:26:35.144]  You're dealing with Trump, the politician.
[05:26:35.664 --> 05:26:37.946]  He's trying to win over as many voters.
[05:26:38.007 --> 05:26:40.149]  He's going to the center on some of these issues.
[05:26:40.569 --> 05:26:41.350]  Don't panic.
[05:26:41.850 --> 05:26:46.435]  In fact, don't even be surprised if he's just outright lying about these policies and changes stance when he gets in.
[05:26:46.875 --> 05:26:50.038]  But I feel like he tried to explain that when he brought up abortion.
[05:26:50.058 --> 05:26:52.880]   He said, hey, look, We got to get as many votes as possible.
[05:26:53.441 --> 05:26:55.422]  Most of America feels this way about abortion.
[05:26:55.602 --> 05:26:56.943]  So we're just going to leave it to the states.
[05:26:57.183 --> 05:26:58.624]  I got to get as many votes as possible.
[05:26:58.684 --> 05:26:59.905]  And he kind of stopped right there.
[05:27:00.305 --> 05:27:11.172]  But I think that was him kind of flagging to his base that really seems to be reactionary saying, hey, look, don't be so reactionary when I do some of these policy things that are more towards the middle.
[05:27:11.712 --> 05:27:13.233]  We've got to get in the White House.
[05:27:13.253 --> 05:27:14.334]  We've got to win an election.
[05:27:14.534 --> 05:27:15.975]  Then we can really deal with this stuff.
[05:27:16.593 --> 05:27:17.514]  Yeah, that's a great point.
[05:27:17.694 --> 05:27:23.618]  And I was worried about how he was going to handle the abortion conversation because it's so sensitive and it's a make it or break it issue for so many voters.
[05:27:24.079 --> 05:27:30.443]  But here's why I don't care about the abortion issue when it comes to this particular race.
[05:27:30.904 --> 05:27:31.984]  I'm 100% pro-life.
[05:27:32.025 --> 05:27:35.607]  I think abortion is always wrong from conception to the very end.
[05:27:35.627 --> 05:27:36.588]  I don't think it should ever be done.
[05:27:37.008 --> 05:28:02.830]   But the fact of the matter is, if the issue is fundamentally about human life and protecting human life and fighting for humanity, Then it's abundantly clear that the chances of millions upon millions of people dying in conflicts, whether it's World War III or isolated conflicts with Russia or any of these other wars that are gonna break out, the chances of millions upon millions of additional people dying under Biden are so much greater and higher than under Trump.
[05:28:03.110 --> 05:28:19.492]   So yes, I'm abundantly pro-life, not pro-choice, pro-life, but It's not a make it or break it issue when it comes to these candidates because regardless of what their policies are on abortion, it's unilaterally the case that Biden's going to result in the death of more innocent people.
[05:28:20.132 --> 05:28:23.215]  Well, Trump has to think politically, strategically.
[05:28:23.535 --> 05:28:32.863]  And I think that when you look at where Biden tries to really get his juice, it's on climate change.
[05:28:32.983 --> 05:28:33.323]  Guess what?
[05:28:33.363 --> 05:28:34.004]  Nobody cares.
[05:28:34.544 --> 05:28:35.405]  It's on abortion.
[05:28:35.885 --> 05:28:36.365]  Guess what?
[05:28:36.486 --> 05:28:38.968]  The single issue abortion voters aren't going to change this election.
[05:28:40.074 --> 05:28:41.198]  It's on January 6th.
[05:28:41.218 --> 05:28:41.559]  Guess what?
[05:28:41.599 --> 05:28:42.321]  Nobody cares.
[05:28:42.863 --> 05:28:47.376]  So when he's trying to hedge his bets on these issues...
[05:28:48.337 --> 05:28:50.798]  It's just not, there's no victory in it for him.
[05:28:51.119 --> 05:28:52.719]  There's no victory for the Democrats there.
[05:28:53.260 --> 05:29:01.424]  And so, I don't know if they try to change their tune on these things, if they get a new candidate in, but these are not winning issues.
[05:29:01.504 --> 05:29:01.965]  I'm sorry.
[05:29:02.005 --> 05:29:04.726]  You can lean into the climate crisis as much as you want.
[05:29:04.746 --> 05:29:06.687]  You can lean into January 6th as much as you want.
[05:29:06.727 --> 05:29:08.748]  You can lean into the abortion issue as much as you want.
[05:29:09.188 --> 05:29:12.830]  These are not winning issues in the 2024 election.
[05:29:12.910 --> 05:29:13.731]  They simply aren't.
[05:29:14.372 --> 05:29:15.373]  I absolutely agree with you.
[05:29:15.453 --> 05:29:20.856]  I think the fundamental issue is immigration and the economy, and they're deeply intertwined.
[05:29:21.216 --> 05:29:26.940]  But this is why Biden's campaign strategy for this debate, and Biden failed at this, by the way.
[05:29:26.960 --> 05:29:33.584]  I think he reverted to old talking points from four years ago, because I honestly think he forgot what he was supposed to say in response to some of these questions.
[05:29:33.864 --> 05:29:37.287]  So he defaulted to the archives of what he can still access in his broken mind.
[05:29:37.307 --> 05:29:39.048]  I'm not just trying to say that in a hyperbolic way.
[05:29:39.728 --> 05:29:59.728]   But I think what's going on here is They told him not to rely on data or the accomplishments of his presidency because the fact of the matter is, no matter what you tell people, they still understand that they're feeling real financial and economic pain under this administration.
[05:29:59.747 --> 05:30:03.828]   So you can throw out statistics about unemployment, you can throw out statistics all day long
[05:30:03.828 --> 05:30:09.006]   about inflation rates going down and deficit differences between the two presidents,
[05:30:09.006 --> 05:30:12.186]   and they always lie with the statistics and manipulate them and frame them in a way
[05:30:12.186 --> 05:30:14.346]  that's more conducive to their political agenda.
[05:30:14.346 --> 05:30:17.027]   But the fact of the matter is, people are going to the grocery store
[05:30:17.027 --> 05:30:18.947]  and leaving with less than is on their list.
[05:30:18.947 --> 05:30:22.648]   For the first time since I was in my early 20s, Owen, I started filling up my gas tank
[05:30:22.648 --> 05:30:24.347]  a quarter of a tank at a time.
[05:30:24.347 --> 05:30:29.867]   Like at one point when I started my own business in 2016, I thought, "Oh, I finally made it into like successful
[05:30:29.867 --> 05:30:34.827]   financial adulthood because I don't have to worry about whether or not I can fill up the whole gas tank."
[05:30:34.044 --> 05:30:39.107]  But now I'm so tight on my budget, my wife allots me X number of dollars a week because she's got it all figured out on spreadsheets.
[05:30:39.127 --> 05:30:39.868]  I hate doing that stuff.
[05:30:40.268 --> 05:30:50.975]  And this is the type of pain and pressure that no matter how many statistics or data points that the Biden administration throws at me, it's not going to change the fact that it's painful for me to fill the gas tank just like it is for all other Americans.
[05:30:51.195 --> 05:31:02.003]  Well, and that's why I don't think Joe Biden could really lean into the economy issues because he's basically gaslighting everybody that's listening that knows the truth because they're living it.
[05:31:02.063 --> 05:31:05.726]  They're living with the higher energy bills, the higher gas prices, the higher grocery bills.
[05:31:06.066 --> 05:31:19.014]   You know, I think a couple big moments that really turned the table, I think, When Trump brought up the border, and he called it the Biden invasion, and he talked about the young girls getting raped and murdered, Biden had nothing.
[05:31:19.074 --> 05:31:20.075]  He had nothing on that.
[05:31:20.855 --> 05:31:23.817]  And the kill shot was when Trump said, by the way, I talked to the families.
[05:31:23.977 --> 05:31:24.857]  Biden never has.
[05:31:25.057 --> 05:31:25.257]  Right.
[05:31:25.317 --> 05:31:26.558]  He's never called those families.
[05:31:26.578 --> 05:31:28.919]  I think that was a very significant moment.
[05:31:28.939 --> 05:31:31.701]  Some other moments that may be significant to people that are politically wrong.
[05:31:31.721 --> 05:31:33.902]  And Biden was supposed to respond that crime is down.
[05:31:34.082 --> 05:31:37.084]  Because that's the Democratic talking point on that issue.
[05:31:37.104 --> 05:31:41.886]  Whenever you say that immigration crime is an issue, they say, oh, well, all the FBI statistics show that crime is actually down.
[05:31:42.106 --> 05:31:43.267]  He forgot to do that.
[05:31:44.494 --> 05:31:52.896]  I think that when Biden got really angry about the suckers and losers line that Trump denied, that I think he probably won on that because of Biden's response.
[05:31:53.397 --> 05:32:00.199]  When Biden went with the very fine people hoax that even Snopes now admits is a fake news story, I think that's going to cost him.
[05:32:00.879 --> 05:32:08.101]  Maybe less significant when Trump talked about Governor Northam saying we have the baby and then we decide whether to kill it or not.
[05:32:08.921 --> 05:32:27.252]   You know, that might be a little less significant, but again, that's something you can just Put out there as red meat and say here's the clip Biden obviously lied You know, I don't know what the Dems do with this and we just got our video list So we'll be going to some of these videos shortly chase guys are Owen Schroeder here with you in the Infowars world headquarters in Austin, Texas
[05:32:27.927 --> 05:32:29.548]  I don't know how this one works with the Democrats.
[05:32:29.588 --> 05:32:32.111]  Again, if you're a Democrat voter, you're lost in a world that doesn't exist.
[05:32:32.171 --> 05:32:35.934]  But they always try to have their cake and eat it too.
[05:32:36.674 --> 05:32:38.776]  Oh, you know, America's the greatest country.
[05:32:38.816 --> 05:32:39.617]  We love America.
[05:32:39.657 --> 05:32:44.241]  And then the next day, America's colonizers and slave owners and racists and bigots.
[05:32:44.621 --> 05:32:46.603]  So they try to have their cake and eat it too with this issue.
[05:32:47.243 --> 05:32:48.685]  I just don't know how that plays.
[05:32:48.966 --> 05:32:49.426]  I don't know.
[05:32:49.446 --> 05:32:54.212]  I mean, again, that's one of those things that if you're really politically involved, you kind of notice and maybe it bothers you.
[05:32:54.232 --> 05:32:59.539]  I don't know if the undecided voter, if the politically ignorant person catches on to that.
[05:33:01.181 --> 05:33:04.756]   But, you know, I just feel like It's kind of wearing thin.
[05:33:05.056 --> 05:33:14.784]  I think that it's wearing thin at this point where they're the ones saying cops are bad and they're the ones saying America's bad and all this stuff and they're deleting our forefathers and everything.
[05:33:14.984 --> 05:33:18.407]  But then they're also saying, no, it's the greatest country in our heritage and everything.
[05:33:19.227 --> 05:33:20.128]  I think that's wearing thin.
[05:33:20.148 --> 05:33:22.270]  I think it's starting to reach its shelf life.
[05:33:22.910 --> 05:33:24.932]  Just have their cake and eat it, too, with that issue.
[05:33:25.212 --> 05:33:25.812]  I think so, too.
[05:33:25.892 --> 05:33:39.787]   And if you think about it, I think traditionally, historically speaking, Shifting your position on a policy as a politician with the changing winds works when the problems are constantly shifting and changing.
[05:33:39.807 --> 05:33:51.595]   And we've come from a background really up until the last eight years where, you know, in 2000 election, 2004 election, 2008 election, 2012 election, All of the major problems and policy issues were shifting,
[05:33:51.595 --> 05:33:56.845]   so it was more conducive to political success for Democrats to have no principles and
[05:33:56.845 --> 05:34:00.195]   then just ride the coattails of whatever was trendy and happening.
[05:34:00.195 --> 05:34:04.494]   The problem with this, though, is that for the last four years, basically all of our
[05:34:04.494 --> 05:34:09.034]   problems have been the same exact problems and just getting worse and worse and worse
[05:34:09.488 --> 05:34:25.211]  So this idea of having your cake and eating it too, or shifting or pivoting on these policies, it's not going to work to an American audience that is like, okay, you can change your mind or change your views or your perspective on any of these policies, but my problems are still the same and getting worse.
[05:34:25.231 --> 05:34:26.031]  What are you going to do about that?
[05:34:26.091 --> 05:34:47.439]   I think that's why people are really going to resonate with Trump as the candidate because he's been consistent about his position on all these major issues for eight years, consistent about his position on Joe Biden for the last four to eight years as well, and this shifting around malleableness, this spinelessness, I don't think it's going to work because our problems are principle-based and so our solution has to be principle-based too.
[05:34:48.266 --> 05:34:52.608]  Trump definitely dominated in the foreign policy segment of the debate.
[05:34:53.769 --> 05:34:57.371]  Trump definitely dominated it, which is a very important aspect, the optics.
[05:34:57.431 --> 05:34:58.611]  He dominated the optics.
[05:34:58.631 --> 05:35:04.714]  And I think that's really why the fake news media, the Democrat media is in panic because of the optics.
[05:35:04.754 --> 05:35:08.956]  They can fake policy arguments and they can even fake a victory in a debate.
[05:35:08.996 --> 05:35:10.477]  They cannot fake the optics.
[05:35:10.537 --> 05:35:12.138]  The optics is what really caused Biden.
[05:35:12.738 --> 05:35:19.654]   And the one thing I find interesting, and I think this is a major tell, The hosts never brought up convicted felon.
[05:35:19.914 --> 05:35:21.835]  The moderators never brought that up.
[05:35:22.235 --> 05:35:24.316]  And it only got mentioned once by Joe Biden.
[05:35:24.757 --> 05:35:30.260]  So to me, that says they know, hey, these political attacks on Trump have hurt us.
[05:35:30.880 --> 05:35:32.221]  They've helped his campaign.
[05:35:32.321 --> 05:35:33.662]  They've helped his candidacy.
[05:35:34.082 --> 05:35:35.903]  So let's not go there.
[05:35:35.983 --> 05:35:39.765]  I was actually surprised that they chose not to go there as many times.
[05:35:39.885 --> 05:35:41.146]  Like I said, only went there once.
[05:35:41.186 --> 05:35:41.867]  It was Joe Biden.
[05:35:41.927 --> 05:35:43.047]  I think that was very measured.
[05:35:43.367 --> 05:35:44.728]  Let's not say convicted felon.
[05:35:44.748 --> 05:35:45.869]  That's helping his cause.
[05:35:46.756 --> 05:35:47.917]  I absolutely agree with you.
[05:35:47.997 --> 05:35:49.318]  It seemed like it was an avoided issue.
[05:35:49.398 --> 05:36:01.306]  I thought it was going to get drilled in, but that was the right strategy for the Democrats was not to bring that up because every time that comes up, Donald Trump gets more money to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars since these 34 erroneous convictions.
[05:36:01.726 --> 05:36:08.170]  And the fact of the matter is we are a culture, a country where virtually everyone has watched the Shawshank Redemption, right?
[05:36:08.611 --> 05:36:13.614]  I mean, it was the number one, it was the number one most rented movie from Blockbuster when Blockbuster still existed.
[05:36:13.974 --> 05:36:19.797]  And so, we just inherently understand that just because you're convicted doesn't mean that you're guilty.
[05:36:19.977 --> 05:36:23.199]  Well, nowadays a lot of people know somebody who's been wrongly convicted or imprisoned.
[05:36:23.299 --> 05:36:24.800]  Yeah, I was thinking about this earlier today.
[05:36:24.820 --> 05:36:27.001]  Practically everybody I know seems like they're going to prison these days.
[05:36:27.041 --> 05:36:28.581]  So, it's just not going to work.
[05:36:28.621 --> 05:36:30.823]  They just sentenced another January 6th protest.
[05:36:30.883 --> 05:36:32.523]  I'm telling you, there's still going to be hundreds of arrests.
[05:36:32.543 --> 05:36:33.484]  They just sentenced another one.
[05:36:33.844 --> 05:36:37.106]  Yeah, and so, they made the right call not doing that.
[05:36:37.186 --> 05:36:50.474]   And the fact of the matter is, it's abundantly obvious that regardless of the fact that Joe Biden hasn't been formally convicted of any crimes, There is so much overwhelming evidence of the litany of crimes that he's committed, not to mention the fact that his son is a felon.
[05:36:50.494 --> 05:36:52.476]  And I understand that his son's not the one running for president.
[05:36:52.516 --> 05:36:53.937]  That's a reasonable thing to say.
[05:36:54.277 --> 05:36:56.358]  But I just think Biden didn't want to go there, man.
[05:36:56.519 --> 05:37:00.502]  Well, and Trump actually did well mentioning, hey, you know, you might be facing a lot of charges.
[05:37:00.642 --> 05:37:07.427]  I think he kind of nuanced that into that where it wasn't overt, but it was like he kind of got the point across, maybe got people curious, at least.
[05:37:08.006 --> 05:37:12.826]   The one part I also think that people might forget, but I think it had value.
[05:37:12.826 --> 05:37:17.546]   When Trump started talking about firing people, he's like, "Yeah, why aren't you firing people?
[05:37:17.546 --> 05:37:18.546]  Of course I fired people."
[05:37:18.546 --> 05:37:19.546]  That's his brand.
[05:37:19.546 --> 05:37:20.546]  Fired.
[05:37:20.546 --> 05:37:23.586]   Yeah, and I kind of wish he would have maybe even gone even further with that.
[05:37:24.375 --> 05:37:27.294]   and even leaned into corrupt politicians needing to be fired.
[05:37:27.294 --> 05:37:31.133]   But still, I think that that served a purpose, and I don't think it was minor.
[05:37:31.133 --> 05:37:34.054]   I think the one thing we all agree on, and we're gonna go to the video clips.
[05:37:34.054 --> 05:37:38.865]   I think the one thing we all agree on, we would like to see a Joe Biden versus Donald Trump golf
[05:37:38.865 --> 05:37:39.494]  match.
[05:37:39.494 --> 05:37:41.974]  I think everybody would like to see that.
[05:37:41.974 --> 05:37:47.654]   And there is 0% chance that Joe Biden is a six handicap, okay?
[05:37:47.813 --> 05:37:49.935]  Yeah, I've seen your swing.
[05:37:50.015 --> 05:37:51.557]  That was one of the best responses ever.
[05:37:51.577 --> 05:37:52.718]  They didn't use Mike for that one.
[05:37:52.898 --> 05:37:57.422]  There's people that play golf their whole lives that can't get to a six handicap, okay?
[05:37:57.902 --> 05:37:59.684]  So that was such a ridiculous lie.
[05:37:59.724 --> 05:38:02.506]  All right, now this is after the debate.
[05:38:02.926 --> 05:38:05.289]  CNN mistakenly leaves the camera still running.
[05:38:05.789 --> 05:38:09.612]   Joe Biden, dazed and confused, So there's a confused Joe Biden.
[05:38:09.632 --> 05:38:10.773]  Donald Trump's already gone.
[05:38:10.593 --> 05:38:16.972]   on. Jill has to come on to the stage, escort him off the stage in a very
[05:38:16.972 --> 05:38:19.531]   awkward moment. They're gonna wish that they didn't have the cameras rolling.
[05:38:19.531 --> 05:38:22.893]  Guys, show me clip two.
[05:38:22.893 --> 05:38:32.413]   So there's a confused Joe Biden. Donald Trump's already gone. Yeah, he walked
[05:38:32.413 --> 05:38:37.212]  right off. Doesn't have any problem.
[05:38:35.281 --> 05:38:35.941]  Knows where he is.
[05:38:36.442 --> 05:38:38.263]  There's Joe Biden standing there, dazed and confused.
[05:38:38.303 --> 05:38:41.806]  Jill grabbing him by the arm, trying to get him to exit stage.
[05:38:41.886 --> 05:38:43.848]  Now he's having trouble dealing with the steps.
[05:38:43.988 --> 05:38:44.588]  Oh, no railing.
[05:38:44.969 --> 05:38:49.192]  Now he needs a second helping hand because he can't even handle steps.
[05:38:50.773 --> 05:38:56.578]  And then finally, Jill is able to escort him off the stage and now dragging him across the stage by the hand.
[05:38:56.938 --> 05:38:57.699]  That's a cheap fake.
[05:38:57.719 --> 05:38:58.580]  This isn't what happened.
[05:38:59.881 --> 05:39:09.998]   Chase, in the last Ten days or so, we saw Joe Biden have to drag Joe Biden off the stage by the arm, and now, excuse me, Barack Obama.
[05:39:10.058 --> 05:39:10.318]  Yes.
[05:39:10.459 --> 05:39:11.399]  Sorry, been on air since three.
[05:39:11.699 --> 05:39:20.201]  Barack Obama have to drag Joe Biden off the stage by the arm, and now Jill Biden having to drag Joe Biden off the stage by the arm.
[05:39:20.342 --> 05:39:22.242]  This is, you can't recover from that.
[05:39:22.722 --> 05:39:23.843]  Yeah, I mean, it's obvious.
[05:39:23.883 --> 05:39:25.223]  The cheap fake thing isn't going to work either.
[05:39:26.243 --> 05:39:31.051]   Everything that they're doing now sounds It comes off like desperation.
[05:39:31.412 --> 05:39:39.117]  And I think the party tonight, the establishment tonight, the establishment political class has formally made the decision that he is not going to be the candidate.
[05:39:39.197 --> 05:39:40.298]  And it's because of things like this.
[05:39:40.338 --> 05:39:41.319]  He's just not there.
[05:39:41.619 --> 05:39:51.306]  Even when they were, even when here on the Alex Jones Show tonight, when we were covering it, Alex did something really interesting where he would go back to old clips of Joe Biden, you know, because we're doing commentary on the debate.
[05:39:51.326 --> 05:39:52.967]  We didn't want to just restream it without commentary.
[05:39:53.307 --> 05:40:01.873]   And even comparing Biden now to Biden four years ago or eight years ago or 20 or 30 years ago, Is stark and this was just the final nail in the coffin.
[05:40:01.954 --> 05:40:03.094]  I don't know who it's going to be for sure.
[05:40:03.134 --> 05:40:04.375]  I've got opinions and ideas.
[05:40:04.856 --> 05:40:14.123]  You know, there are a lot of people I respect have different opinions and ideas about who it's going to be, but I think we're quickly arriving at a place where it's not even up for debate as to whether or not they're going to replace him with someone.
[05:40:14.604 --> 05:40:24.031]  Yeah, it feels that way, even though there seems to be some denial on behalf of the Biden campaign because this was Jill Biden in the Biden campaign room.
[05:40:24.191 --> 05:40:28.511]   not Joe, Jill in the Biden campaign room after the debate clip one.
[05:40:28.511 --> 05:40:37.790]  Joe, you did such a great job.
[05:40:37.821 --> 05:40:39.762]  You answered every question.
[05:40:39.842 --> 05:40:41.963]  You knew all the... You answered every question.
[05:40:42.023 --> 05:40:43.223]  Mary is confused.
[05:40:44.583 --> 05:40:47.985]  And let me ask the crowd, what did Trump do?
[05:40:51.210 --> 05:40:52.210]  Oh my gosh.
[05:40:52.210 --> 05:40:53.210]  What is he looking at?
[05:40:53.210 --> 05:40:54.210]  That is brutal.
[05:40:54.210 --> 05:40:55.889]   Did you notice the whole debate he barely ever looked at Trump?
[05:40:55.889 --> 05:40:56.889]  He was staring off to the left.
[05:40:56.889 --> 05:40:58.530]  There's not even the moderator to the left.
[05:40:58.530 --> 05:41:02.530]   Actually I did notice how he, maybe he was looking at like a random camera operator or
[05:41:02.530 --> 05:41:03.530]  a boom mic operator.
[05:41:03.530 --> 05:41:05.130]  I couldn't figure, but you're right.
[05:41:05.130 --> 05:41:10.889]   He kept looking over to his left where I can only figure there was a camera person or maybe
[05:41:10.889 --> 05:41:13.490]  there was like a, maybe just a shiny object.
[05:41:13.566 --> 05:41:13.886]  I don't know.
[05:41:14.066 --> 05:41:14.746]  It was bizarre.
[05:41:14.926 --> 05:41:22.768]  And it was funny because while we were watching the debate, I said, I said to Harrison, I said, Harrison, look up whether mouth breathing is a sign of cognitive decline.
[05:41:23.228 --> 05:41:26.969]  This dude almost exclusively breathes through his mouth.
[05:41:28.249 --> 05:41:31.930]  Like again, I'm not trying to make cheap shots again, but he looks constantly confused.
[05:41:32.190 --> 05:41:38.182]   I mean, when you're on a stage, Traditionally speaking, even if you're a stupid person, you're self-conscious.
[05:41:38.462 --> 05:41:42.206]  You're aware of how maybe you look, maybe you're trying to adjust your tie to make sure it's centered.
[05:41:42.426 --> 05:41:55.437]  We all make mistakes and flub up sometimes, but for him to just be standing there staring in the wrong direction, knowing that he's on live television, with his mouth open the whole time, it was as if he wasn't even aware or able to conceive of the notion that other people were watching him.
[05:41:55.698 --> 05:41:59.081]  It's like he felt like he was actually in that room with just four people and not millions watching.
[05:41:59.221 --> 05:42:01.663]  Well, and that's probably why they had it set up that way.
[05:42:02.742 --> 05:42:05.945]  You know this to think that he took a week to prepare for that too.
[05:42:06.285 --> 05:42:10.609]  I mean, that's just that's even more worrisome that that's a week of preparation.
[05:42:10.629 --> 05:42:16.324]   You know, it reminds me of I just like doing sports analogies because I came from the
[05:42:16.324 --> 05:42:18.523]   sports media before I joined Infowars.
[05:42:18.523 --> 05:42:23.203]   It reminds me of when the Denver Broncos laid an absolute egg against the Seattle Seahawks.
[05:42:23.203 --> 05:42:24.203]  I know you're not a sports guy.
[05:42:24.203 --> 05:42:25.203]  I love sports.
[05:42:25.203 --> 05:42:27.563]  I'm probably speaking gibberish to you.
[05:42:27.563 --> 05:42:31.363]   But Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos were huge favorites.
[05:42:31.363 --> 05:42:34.683]   Everybody thought that they were going to win and then they get into the Super Bowl
[05:42:35.504 --> 05:42:36.965]  I think the final score is like 52 to 3.
[05:42:37.685 --> 05:42:40.427]  First snap, they snap the ball over his head.
[05:42:40.687 --> 05:42:42.148]  Like, doesn't happen ever.
[05:42:42.468 --> 05:42:43.288]  Like, never happens.
[05:42:43.528 --> 05:42:47.470]  Super Bowl, two weeks to prepare, and you snap the ball over the quarterback's head.
[05:42:47.531 --> 05:42:48.351]  It, like, never happens.
[05:42:48.571 --> 05:42:53.334]  That was like Joe Biden coming out and he was, uh, kind of gonna speak like this.
[05:42:53.674 --> 05:42:54.474]  He didn't even have a voice.
[05:42:54.834 --> 05:42:57.015]  And by the way, I always thought the Denver Broncos threw that game.
[05:42:57.196 --> 05:42:58.016]  But that's another story.
[05:42:58.296 --> 05:43:01.826]   And maybe they threw the debate for For Biden, because they wanted him out.
[05:43:01.946 --> 05:43:04.469]  But it was just like, that's a week of preparation and that's all you got?
[05:43:05.010 --> 05:43:09.336]  Here's Kamala Harris having to admit it was a miserable start.
[05:43:09.695 --> 05:43:10.975]  Afterwards, clip four.
[05:43:10.975 --> 05:43:32.534]   Listen, first of all, what we saw tonight is the president making a very clear
[05:43:32.534 --> 05:43:36.455]   contrast with Donald Trump on all of the issues that matter to the American people.
[05:43:36.911 --> 05:43:39.433]  Yes, there was a slow start, but it was a strong finish.
[05:43:39.573 --> 05:43:46.880]  And what became very clear through the course of the night is that Joe Biden is fighting on behalf of the American people.
[05:43:46.900 --> 05:43:50.363]  Do you think Kamala realizes what danger she's in at this point?
[05:43:50.423 --> 05:43:58.152]   And look, I got to be honest, people We have to look at all the angles here, and Alex and our guests always look at all the angles.
[05:43:58.312 --> 05:44:02.215]  I really don't even like to talk about the potentials of what the deep state might do here.
[05:44:02.295 --> 05:44:03.536]  But I mean, it's already been covered.
[05:44:03.636 --> 05:44:04.817]  I really don't even like talking about it.
[05:44:04.857 --> 05:44:09.741]  But I mean, do you think Kamala realizes what potential danger even she's in?
[05:44:09.841 --> 05:44:15.466]  I mean, if she's smart, she needs to like, kind of back off and just say, look, do what you got to do.
[05:44:15.626 --> 05:44:16.386]  I'm not in the way.
[05:44:17.047 --> 05:44:18.028]  She will be lucky.
[05:44:18.843 --> 05:44:27.201]  The best outcome for her is that once the Biden campaign realizes that it's lost the support of the political establishment, the Democratic Party, the media.
[05:44:28.001 --> 05:44:35.887]  When Biden withdraws from the race, the best that Kamala Harris can hope for is being the VP for whoever the next candidate is.
[05:44:36.347 --> 05:44:39.770]  So she could come out and save face and say, I always just wanted to be the VP.
[05:44:40.030 --> 05:44:41.251]  I want to support this next candidate.
[05:44:41.311 --> 05:44:43.393]  I don't want to be the President of the United States yet.
[05:44:43.493 --> 05:44:44.734]  I want to let somebody else take over.
[05:44:44.994 --> 05:44:46.976]  I just want to continue to be in my role as VP.
[05:44:47.136 --> 05:44:48.377]  That's the best that she can hope for.
[05:44:48.397 --> 05:44:58.224]   I don't think there's any risk for her life, but she's basically politically doomed because she was one of the least popular candidates during the 2020 Uh, primary election.
[05:44:58.904 --> 05:45:16.935]  And the only reason she's in the position that she's in is because she was riding the coattails of an establishment back to Joe Biden, CIA back to Joe Biden, who was, in my opinion, blackmailed into running in order to guarantee that he would be able to pardon Hunter Biden, which is, I think, one of the reasons why they've gone after Hunter this whole time is because they needed to leverage keeping Biden in office.
[05:45:16.955 --> 05:45:18.116]  That's why the whole family supports him.
[05:45:18.136 --> 05:45:18.877]  That's why Jill supports him.
[05:45:18.897 --> 05:45:21.198]  It's all about saving Hunter, I think, in a lot of ways.
[05:45:21.218 --> 05:45:32.629]   Perfect Manchurian candidate, perfect shock puppet for Barack Obama, who even said, like, yeah, I'll be the president from behind, nobody will know it'll be me, I'll just have somebody up there pretending it's me.
[05:45:33.530 --> 05:45:37.533]  It's funny, here we are, and even Joe Biden said, you know what, I'll just say I'm sick and I'll step aside.
[05:45:37.894 --> 05:45:42.117]  So maybe, now, because they're saying he had a cold, is what they're saying, he had a cold now, really, in the middle of summer.
[05:45:42.537 --> 05:45:43.278]  I'm sure that's what it was.
[05:45:43.959 --> 05:45:49.203]  So, okay, now this is live at MSNBC, and by the way, these clips are everywhere, folks.
[05:45:49.283 --> 05:45:51.025]  I'm telling you, CNN, MSNBC.
[05:45:51.883 --> 05:45:55.366]  The news networks that have been running cover for Joe Biden have now all turned on him.
[05:45:55.607 --> 05:45:56.427]  It's a disaster.
[05:45:56.567 --> 05:45:57.488]  They don't want him anymore.
[05:45:58.109 --> 05:46:05.355]  And this is in live time where MSNBC is asking black voters if they're going to vote for Biden again, and it doesn't go well.
[05:46:05.436 --> 05:46:05.916]  Clip five.
[05:46:07.277 --> 05:46:09.319]  Raise your hand for me if you voted for Biden in 2020.
[05:46:09.479 --> 05:46:14.524]  And keep your hand up if you're still with him this time around after that debate.
[05:46:16.287 --> 05:46:17.328]  Slowly going down.
[05:46:17.788 --> 05:46:20.369]  And, you know, I don't think it's a surprise it's the men.
[05:46:20.489 --> 05:46:22.370]  The one woman kept her hand up, the men dropped it.
[05:46:22.690 --> 05:46:28.032]  I think Biden is losing not just the male vote, specifically the black male vote.
[05:46:28.673 --> 05:46:29.173]  They don't want him.
[05:46:29.433 --> 05:46:31.134]  Well, the question really is simple.
[05:46:32.094 --> 05:46:40.058]  Which demographic or class or genre of people is actually positively affected by a second term for Joe Biden?
[05:46:40.337 --> 05:46:44.976]   honestly I cannot think of a single demographic or special interest other
[05:46:44.976 --> 05:46:49.936]   than maybe some foreign ones that would benefit from a second term of Joe Biden.
[05:46:49.936 --> 05:46:52.898]   Whether you're looking at the transgender community, which their policy is
[05:46:52.898 --> 05:46:56.537]   officially to sterilize people as soon as they start to show symptoms of gender
[05:46:56.537 --> 05:47:00.176]   dysphoria, or you look at minority communities in terms of race, they've all
[05:47:00.176 --> 05:47:02.747]  been disenfranchised by the influx of illegal migrants.
[05:47:02.747 --> 05:47:07.377]   Whether you look at the elderly class who's retiring.
[05:47:05.381 --> 05:47:11.185]  Their social security is being stripped from them and inflation is so high that they had enough to retire, but now it's not worth anything.
[05:47:11.426 --> 05:47:12.767]  I mean, there's no one that benefits.
[05:47:12.787 --> 05:47:18.651]  And I think people are just realizing that, hey, regardless of how I feel about Donald Trump, this guy is no dice.
[05:47:19.423 --> 05:47:24.386]  Well, and also it was Biden that wrote the crime bill in 1994 and bragged about it.
[05:47:24.466 --> 05:47:27.168]  It was Donald Trump that passed the First Step Act.
[05:47:27.188 --> 05:47:28.529]  A lot of people are aware of that.
[05:47:28.829 --> 05:47:33.411]  Whether they've been in prison themselves or they have family, that's something that they're very aware of.
[05:47:34.252 --> 05:47:35.693]  Trust me, I was behind bars, I know.
[05:47:36.494 --> 05:47:38.855]  Now, Gavin Newsom seems to be the belle of the ball.
[05:47:39.115 --> 05:47:40.875]  The media is following him around.
[05:47:41.055 --> 05:47:42.596]  He's doing the TV rounds.
[05:47:42.956 --> 05:47:45.277]  I mean, literally, there's a gaggle following him around.
[05:47:45.597 --> 05:47:47.557]  And the whole narrative is, it's going to be Gavin.
[05:47:47.577 --> 05:47:48.257]  It's going to be Gavin.
[05:47:48.498 --> 05:47:51.258]  He's number two right now with the Vegas odds to be nominated.
[05:47:51.758 --> 05:47:54.339]  And here was just a short clip of him being interviewed.
[05:47:54.959 --> 05:47:56.220]  Gavin, are you going to step up?
[05:47:56.320 --> 05:47:56.740]  Clip six.
[05:47:57.452 --> 05:47:59.453]  Are you going to be the next Democratic nominee?
[05:47:59.653 --> 05:48:01.634]  No, our nominee is Joe Biden.
[05:48:01.674 --> 05:48:04.095]  I'm looking forward to voting for him in November.
[05:48:04.115 --> 05:48:05.476]  He's going to be our nominee.
[05:48:05.496 --> 05:48:08.277]  Because you know that everyone are talking about you as a possible nominee now.
[05:48:10.258 --> 05:48:11.559]  Are you enjoying it?
[05:48:11.879 --> 05:48:12.559]  We're going up here?
[05:48:12.959 --> 05:48:13.920]  It looks like he's enjoying it.
[05:48:14.180 --> 05:48:14.940]  American Psycho.
[05:48:14.960 --> 05:48:16.261]  The question is, what was he doing there?
[05:48:16.281 --> 05:48:18.082]  Kind of looks like the cartoon Joker.
[05:48:19.020 --> 05:48:21.523]  Uh, well, he was a support group for Joe, I'm sure.
[05:48:21.543 --> 05:48:22.423]  But who else was in the group?
[05:48:22.443 --> 05:48:23.124]  I mean, what?
[05:48:23.584 --> 05:48:24.645]  Any other Democratic governors?
[05:48:24.745 --> 05:48:27.328]  But again, notice he wasn't in the Biden campaign room.
[05:48:27.408 --> 05:48:28.429]  He was doing media rounds.
[05:48:29.329 --> 05:48:29.990]  Very bizarre.
[05:48:30.010 --> 05:48:31.491]  But he doesn't have a book out like Hillary.
[05:48:33.153 --> 05:48:35.335]  I don't think he had an op-ed in the New York Times either.
[05:48:35.355 --> 05:48:36.176]  He's been silent on Twitter.
[05:48:36.216 --> 05:48:37.637]  He hasn't tweeted in like seven hours.
[05:48:38.277 --> 05:48:39.118]  That was the last I checked.
[05:48:39.338 --> 05:48:40.119]  So, very bizarre.
[05:48:41.240 --> 05:48:43.302]  But this is not insignificant.
[05:48:43.877 --> 05:48:45.959]  The media is not talking good about Joe Biden.
[05:48:46.440 --> 05:48:48.321]  It's like they're begging Newsom to run.
[05:48:48.441 --> 05:48:49.442]  They're like begging for it.
[05:48:49.482 --> 05:48:50.904]  Again, did you see that gaggle?
[05:48:51.364 --> 05:48:52.665]  That's not around Joe Biden.
[05:48:53.246 --> 05:48:54.767]  Who's doing TV rounds afterwards?
[05:48:55.108 --> 05:48:55.848]  It's not Biden.
[05:48:56.029 --> 05:48:56.629]  It's Newsom.
[05:48:57.010 --> 05:49:06.238]  Well, when was the last time that a candidate lost a presidential debate and they were swarmed by the press after, or someone else was swarmed by the press after as to whether or not they would replace the candidate who lost?
[05:49:06.478 --> 05:49:07.940]  I mean, that's totally unprecedented.
[05:49:08.479 --> 05:49:14.563]  And I understand that this debate is one of the first, if not the first debates that's ever happened before the conventions, before they're formally the candidates.
[05:49:14.583 --> 05:49:14.903]  It's the first.
[05:49:15.203 --> 05:49:25.930]  But even so, it's bizarre and it seems like there was a green light at the top because people think about these different TV networks or newspapers as if they're different organizations or different entities.
[05:49:25.990 --> 05:49:32.094]  Most of them are publicly traded, not all of them, but they are all infiltrated and compromised by the intelligence community ever since the Red Scare.
[05:49:32.114 --> 05:49:33.894]  I mean, this is Project Mockingbird level stuff.
[05:49:33.894 --> 05:49:40.033]   So when one does something, they all do it as well, except for maybe some token opposition network
[05:49:40.033 --> 05:49:41.033]  like Fox or something.
[05:49:41.033 --> 05:49:42.712]  Everything else is just alternative media.
[05:49:42.712 --> 05:49:45.114]   That's why you can only get the truth from alternative media.
[05:49:45.114 --> 05:49:50.153]   And so for an entire gaggle of swamp creatures who literally answered to producers and editors
[05:49:50.153 --> 05:49:51.914]  are running up and talking about the same thing.
[05:49:51.914 --> 05:49:55.594]   You have David Axelrod of all people for the first time admitting,
[05:49:55.594 --> 05:49:59.473]   I mean, this was a conspiracy theory yesterday to suggest that it was even possible
[05:49:59.473 --> 05:50:01.473]  that Joe Biden wouldn't be the candidate.
[05:50:01.166 --> 05:50:03.627]  Now it's a mainstream talking point.
[05:50:04.167 --> 05:50:05.607]  Very, very enlightening, I think.
[05:50:05.787 --> 05:50:11.008]  By the way, David Axelrod was the epitome of this current state of the Democrat Party afterwards on CNN.
[05:50:11.208 --> 05:50:12.829]  Disheveled, slovenly.
[05:50:13.349 --> 05:50:15.549]  It looked like somebody just poured water on him or something.
[05:50:15.569 --> 05:50:16.369]  I don't know what that was.
[05:50:16.730 --> 05:50:18.930]  Glasses fogging up, drinking from an empty cup.
[05:50:19.594 --> 05:50:20.615]  Like, he was stressed out.
[05:50:20.655 --> 05:50:21.375]  That's your Democrat.
[05:50:21.535 --> 05:50:25.798]  Yeah, pulling his hair out, sweating profusely as he has to go up there and defend Biden.
[05:50:26.258 --> 05:50:29.761]  Here was Donald Trump entering his campaign room after the debate clip three.
[05:50:32.683 --> 05:50:37.246]  Notice how he's able to walk on his own power.
[05:50:39.527 --> 05:50:42.189]  Big difference between Trump and Biden.
[05:50:42.369 --> 05:50:45.671]  One can walk, one can walk in under his own power.
[05:50:46.051 --> 05:50:48.273]  The other needs help from his wife, fake doctor.
[05:50:49.336 --> 05:50:49.879]  Off the stage.
[05:50:50.140 --> 05:50:52.390]  You know, I mean, they're basically opposites in every way.
[05:50:53.411 --> 05:51:01.115]  And one of the things that I really noticed, and I know that the trendy thing to talk about tonight is how terrible Biden's performance was, and it was, and that is the most interesting thing.
[05:51:01.435 --> 05:51:08.259]  But in terms of actual policy substance, if you look at the concluding arguments, anybody, lawyer, whatever, will tell you that that's like the most important thing.
[05:51:08.299 --> 05:51:14.442]  The intro statements and the concluding arguments is a concept in psychology called primacy recency.
[05:51:14.762 --> 05:51:18.184]  People remember the first thing about you, and they remember the last thing about you.
[05:51:18.284 --> 05:51:19.945]  In the middle, it's muddy, right?
[05:51:20.665 --> 05:51:26.629]  And in the closing arguments, Joe Biden literally advocated for raising taxes on Americans.
[05:51:26.669 --> 05:51:33.734]  He said, the wealthy class, but raising taxes on Americans and lowering taxes tariffs on foreign nations.
[05:51:34.094 --> 05:51:37.036]  It's the epitome of the opposite of America first.
[05:51:37.377 --> 05:51:38.537]  And that's what we're seeing here.
[05:51:39.058 --> 05:51:46.703]  That's the stark, the number one main difference, I think, between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, other than the fact that one actually has a mind is Trump's policies are America first.
[05:51:47.463 --> 05:51:51.205]  Biden's policies are globalist conglomeration of political power, America last.
[05:51:51.726 --> 05:51:55.568]  All right, so let's look at the near future and let's look at the far future.
[05:51:55.648 --> 05:51:58.149]  In this case, I'm talking about 130 days till the election.
[05:51:58.590 --> 05:51:59.710]  Joe Biden is still the president.
[05:52:00.111 --> 05:52:00.311]  Yes.
[05:52:00.691 --> 05:52:03.012]  He has to get back to his role as president.
[05:52:04.413 --> 05:52:05.174]  I don't know how he does it.
[05:52:06.254 --> 05:52:14.122]   What attempt or what recovery can Joe Biden have in, let's just say, the next week?
[05:52:14.122 --> 05:52:18.323]  What can he possibly do to recover from this disaster?
[05:52:18.323 --> 05:52:22.922]  I don't think going back into hiding is the answer.
[05:52:22.922 --> 05:52:23.523]  I don't know.
[05:52:23.523 --> 05:52:26.523]   I don't see how Joe Biden recovers from this in the near term.
[05:52:26.523 --> 05:52:28.422]  He's going to have to do something.
[05:52:28.422 --> 05:52:32.422]   Yeah, I think what we're going to see over the next 30 days specifically,
[05:52:32.422 --> 05:52:36.422]   it reminds me of when you go to the doctor because you have some sort of a problem,
[05:52:36.422 --> 05:52:40.801]   just imagine hypothetically, and the doctor says, "Hey, we're gonna run some tests,
[05:52:40.801 --> 05:52:42.662]  but we think that you have cancer."
[05:52:43.007 --> 05:52:51.492]  So right now, they've been given bad news by a doctor, but they have to analyze the test for the next 14 days before they know for sure whether he's terminally ill.
[05:52:51.512 --> 05:52:53.433]  So I think we're going to see a lot of damage control tomorrow.
[05:52:53.713 --> 05:53:03.179]  I think over the next 14 to 30 days, the Biden campaign and presidency is going to be analyzing whether or not him being the candidate is even an option anymore.
[05:53:03.199 --> 05:53:05.600]  I mean, this is devastating for the campaign.
[05:53:05.620 --> 05:53:10.443]  So I don't think he can do anything to recover other than maybe change all of his policies to Donald Trump's policies.
[05:53:10.703 --> 05:53:11.644]  Well, he tried that.
[05:53:11.844 --> 05:53:13.606]  He tried that with the border policy.
[05:53:13.626 --> 05:53:19.632]  They're going to be in denial that this was a terminal diagnosis for his campaign for probably 14 to 30 days.
[05:53:19.792 --> 05:53:23.656]  I anticipate that before the end of July we're going to have a withdrawal from the race.
[05:53:24.992 --> 05:53:40.589]  They're really up against it because in order to get on the Ohio ballot, unless the legislature changes its rules, and maybe they will, they have to nominate before the end of July or it's before the convention in mid-August.
[05:53:40.769 --> 05:53:42.391]  So they're up against it with that.
[05:53:43.031 --> 05:53:51.040]   And plus, Certainly they realize what a disaster it is to try to switch your president right before the convention, you know.
[05:53:51.441 --> 05:53:54.123]  Yes, but nothing's a bigger disaster than Joe Biden.
[05:53:54.223 --> 05:53:54.804]  Right, right.
[05:53:54.844 --> 05:54:02.384]   And that's why we're considering these options because I think that's the realization is that the biggest disaster Is Joe Biden.
[05:54:02.444 --> 05:54:03.905]  And everything else is lesser.
[05:54:04.025 --> 05:54:05.665]  Did you ever watch the series Band of Brothers?
[05:54:06.145 --> 05:54:06.325]  No.
[05:54:06.665 --> 05:54:08.646]  So Band of Brothers is about the 101st Airborne.
[05:54:08.706 --> 05:54:17.688]  There's a famous moment where the leadership sends a particular commanding officer into combat and this guy just breaks down.
[05:54:17.768 --> 05:54:19.308]  He can't follow orders.
[05:54:19.808 --> 05:54:21.588]  The chaos of the battle is too much for him.
[05:54:21.628 --> 05:54:22.429]  He's literally like Biden.
[05:54:22.449 --> 05:54:23.109]  He loses his mind.
[05:54:23.449 --> 05:54:32.041]   And there's this moment where the leadership on the sidelines of this battle in Bastogne Just say, Spears, you're in!
[05:54:32.101 --> 05:54:34.763]  And they replace him at the last second of the battle and it reverses it.
[05:54:35.063 --> 05:54:55.056]  I think we're at a moment, the audience who's watching this, I'm sure a lot of you have because a lot of World War II buffs listen to us, what we're experiencing and witnessing right now within the Democratic Party is that moment in Band of Brothers where they're in the middle of a major battle, they're now realizing their commanding officer is totally incompetent and they have to make a leadership change now, otherwise the whole war could be forfeit for them.
[05:54:56.337 --> 05:54:58.426]   Now, if we look At the election.
[05:54:58.946 --> 05:55:03.769]  Nobody believes Joe Biden can even make it there, I think, at this point, let alone win.
[05:55:04.569 --> 05:55:06.070]  Now they can do an outright steal.
[05:55:06.971 --> 05:55:08.572]  They might even view that as a little risky.
[05:55:09.653 --> 05:55:15.416]  You look at a replacement, no matter who it is, really all they're running on is hatred of Donald Trump.
[05:55:15.736 --> 05:55:15.917]  Yeah.
[05:55:16.137 --> 05:55:21.680]  I don't know how you really build up a policy campaign in a hundred days till an election.
[05:55:21.860 --> 05:55:24.971]   I really don't understand You know, you can't really do that.
[05:55:25.031 --> 05:55:26.533]  You don't really run on policy.
[05:55:26.573 --> 05:55:28.234]  You don't really run on track record.
[05:55:28.715 --> 05:55:31.577]  All you're basically running on is, hey, I'm not Donald Trump.
[05:55:32.258 --> 05:55:33.419]  I don't think that takes.
[05:55:33.739 --> 05:55:34.980]  I don't think that takes either.
[05:55:35.000 --> 05:55:38.403]  I mean, really, I think you're looking at a situation.
[05:55:39.284 --> 05:55:41.947]  Their only option is steal, whether it's Biden or not.
[05:55:42.667 --> 05:55:44.989]  Because the hatred of Donald Trump isn't there.
[05:55:45.450 --> 05:55:47.392]  The I'm not Donald Trump for vote for me.
[05:55:47.692 --> 05:55:48.793]  So vote for me doesn't work.
[05:55:50.822 --> 05:55:52.223]  I think that's what they're looking at here.
[05:55:52.543 --> 05:56:01.909]  Well, and the thing is, during the last election, obviously I believe that it was rigged, but there were certain disadvantages that Trump had then that he doesn't have now, namely the pandemic.
[05:56:02.109 --> 05:56:04.210]  Psychologically, people are very stupid.
[05:56:04.730 --> 05:56:08.573]  They make decisions like voting and purchasing emotionally before rationally.
[05:56:09.273 --> 05:56:15.617]  And push comes to shove, the pandemic was a terrible experience for everyone because of lockdowns and all the terrible policies and the economic crisis.
[05:56:15.897 --> 05:56:17.078]  And so they go to the voting.
[05:56:17.910 --> 05:56:23.482]  Boxer, they've decided to mail in their ballots and they're thinking, okay, who's the president during this terrible time in my life?
[05:56:24.068 --> 05:56:25.049]  I'm going to vote for the other guy.
[05:56:25.449 --> 05:56:26.530]  But it's been four years.
[05:56:26.650 --> 05:56:28.411]  I mean, that pain has worn off.
[05:56:28.752 --> 05:56:34.596]  There just simply isn't the same level of hatred for Donald Trump that there was among Democratic voters.
[05:56:34.656 --> 05:56:43.022]  Now, the establishment still hates him just as much, but Democratic voters have had four years to heal while they deal with the terrible decision that they've made.
[05:56:43.062 --> 05:56:50.968]  And I don't think it's just anecdotal examples when you see video after video on social media of Democrats saying, I'm so sorry that I voted for Joe Biden.
[05:56:50.988 --> 05:56:55.339]   I think a lot More people are friendly to Donald Trump now than were in 2020.
[05:56:56.795 --> 05:56:59.137]  Well, there's no doubt the long knives are out for Biden now.
[05:56:59.417 --> 05:57:02.479]  I really don't see any potential political victories on the horizon.
[05:57:02.659 --> 05:57:06.141]  He's not going to get anything out of foreign policy dealing with Israel or Ukraine.
[05:57:06.181 --> 05:57:07.062]  That's a disaster.
[05:57:07.402 --> 05:57:09.424]  He can't turn around the economy overnight.
[05:57:09.464 --> 05:57:10.444]  There's nothing he can do.
[05:57:11.105 --> 05:57:14.087]  He's already lost on the border issue, even though he's tried to win.
[05:57:14.527 --> 05:57:19.050]  So, I don't even see any potential victories that they can just kind of rip off the tree.
[05:57:19.090 --> 05:57:23.353]  There's no political low-hanging fruit that he can just rip off the tree and have some recovery.
[05:57:23.453 --> 05:57:25.635]  You know, I mean, maybe they do something.
[05:57:27.156 --> 05:57:27.376]  No.
[05:57:27.937 --> 05:57:29.199]  No.
[05:57:29.239 --> 05:57:30.341]  I don't even think that would be enough.
[05:57:30.721 --> 05:57:37.972]  They'd have to go for some lower fruit, like more student debt cancellation or reparations.
[05:57:38.052 --> 05:57:42.559]  I mean, that's the only kind of thing I could see them trying to do to try to pull something positive.
[05:57:43.177 --> 05:57:44.758]  Out of this absolute disaster.
[05:57:45.118 --> 05:57:51.201]  But he's gonna need to correct course, change the narrative, and really do it fast.
[05:57:51.241 --> 05:57:57.984]  Because the narrative right now is Biden's done, he's cooked, he's shot, he just got destroyed in that debate.
[05:57:58.444 --> 05:58:06.447]  And what makes that an even more significant talking point is when you go back, I mean, let's just look at when Trump entered in 2016.
[05:58:08.121 --> 05:58:10.565]  Against Hillary and then against Biden in 2020.
[05:58:10.926 --> 05:58:13.530]  They never admit when their candidates lose a debate.
[05:58:14.111 --> 05:58:16.174]  It's always nothing but a victory.
[05:58:16.816 --> 05:58:18.018]  They're admitting he lost!
[05:58:18.979 --> 05:58:22.485]  All the same people that will tell you no matter what the Democrat candidate always wins.
[05:58:23.168 --> 05:58:24.208]  They're admitting he lost.
[05:58:24.689 --> 05:58:28.450]  Another reason to believe that this was set up actually rigged against Joe Biden.
[05:58:28.470 --> 05:58:36.813]  I mean, we were talking about how it was rigged against Trump, and it was in every surface level way in terms of time and follow-up questions and muting of the microphones.
[05:58:37.313 --> 05:58:41.134]  But essentially, this couldn't have gone worse for Joe Biden.
[05:58:41.254 --> 05:58:47.337]  And one thing that is clear is that Donald Trump definitely made the correct decision in agreeing to participate in this debate.
[05:58:47.557 --> 05:58:50.898]  Trump gets an A, Biden gets an F. Yep.
[05:58:51.378 --> 05:58:51.698]  That's it.
[05:58:51.919 --> 05:58:52.439]  I'm close.
[05:58:52.699 --> 05:58:56.562]  Trump got an A tonight, Biden gets an F. Yes.
[05:58:56.582 --> 05:58:57.083]  It was so obvious.
[05:58:57.103 --> 05:59:00.346]  And if you go back to the 2020 debates- If there was an F minus, he'd get an F minus.
[05:59:00.406 --> 05:59:04.709]  I think, and I would even concede that Donald Trump lost one of the 2020 debates.
[05:59:05.089 --> 05:59:07.892]  I mean, the one where he was talking over him the whole time, it just wasn't a very good performance.
[05:59:07.912 --> 05:59:10.514]  I remember watching it with my family and I'm proudly voting for Trump.
[05:59:11.334 --> 05:59:21.622]  This is not just us being biased and right-wingers or Trump supporters saying this, because I'll concede to you right now that Trump did not do nearly as well against Joe Biden in 2020 debates as he did tonight.
[05:59:21.642 --> 05:59:24.143]  This was an AF-level disparity, I think, yes.
[05:59:24.624 --> 05:59:28.046]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, you see at the bottom of the screen Dr. Jones Naturals.
[05:59:28.146 --> 05:59:31.389]  A lot of us here on the crew are powered by a energy drink.
[05:59:31.449 --> 05:59:32.990]  It's called Turbo Force Plus.
[05:59:33.150 --> 05:59:36.532]  That's how I've been able to be on air since 3 p.m.
[05:59:36.652 --> 05:59:37.993]  and we're about to go on midnight here.
[05:59:38.033 --> 05:59:39.734]  The crew's been working here all day since 8 a.m.
[05:59:40.935 --> 05:59:42.355]  And there's a great product there.
[05:59:42.375 --> 05:59:45.256]  10 hours of clean energy in one scoop of TurboForce+.
[05:59:45.376 --> 05:59:48.336]  It's 20% off right now at drjonesnaturals.com.
[05:59:48.396 --> 05:59:49.217]  Now here's the deal.
[05:59:50.077 --> 05:59:55.438]  The crew up here working late and they're gonna be right back up here in the morning, 8 a.m.
[05:59:55.618 --> 05:59:59.499]  for the American Journal with Harrison Smith.
[05:59:59.619 --> 06:00:01.859]  And you know, we have a big audience tonight.
[06:00:01.959 --> 06:00:05.580]  It's kind of nice to be back in the throes of the election season here at InfoWars.
[06:00:05.720 --> 06:00:07.160]  Obviously, ratings always go up.
[06:00:07.839 --> 06:00:10.461]  And a lot of people may have forgotten we're still on air.
[06:00:10.742 --> 06:00:13.104]  When they censored us everywhere, they might have tuned out.
[06:00:13.244 --> 06:00:14.004]  We're here, folks.
[06:00:14.125 --> 06:00:17.848]  InfoWars is live 10 hours a day.
[06:00:18.288 --> 06:00:21.491]  And if you're just now joining us on X and watching us there, we appreciate it.
[06:00:21.531 --> 06:00:24.854]  We have a Rumble channel with a 24-hour feed where you can find us as well.
[06:00:25.134 --> 06:00:31.460]  We had to create our own video platform, Band.Video, which is where you can go and watch all of our live shows as well.
[06:00:32.140 --> 06:00:35.403]  Chase Geiser over here, he hosts InfoWars Sunday Night Live on Sunday nights.
[06:00:35.723 --> 06:00:39.365]  I'm the host of the InfoWars War Room, following the Alex Jones Show, 3 to 6 p.m.
[06:00:39.465 --> 06:00:40.125]  Central Time.
[06:00:40.485 --> 06:00:45.368]  So, please, if you enjoy InfoWars, if you like what you've seen tonight, tune in to us every day.
[06:00:45.708 --> 06:00:49.110]  There's a reason why they want to shut down, because quite frankly, we're number one.
[06:00:49.410 --> 06:00:52.671]  We're number one, and you can't beat us, so you have to shut us down.
[06:00:52.971 --> 06:00:54.052]  And that's how it goes around here.
[06:00:54.072 --> 06:00:54.892]  But we're proud to be here.
[06:00:54.912 --> 06:00:56.033]  We're proud to be here with the crew.
[06:00:56.953 --> 06:01:03.116]  And, by the way, you know, Chase, you just wrote a book all about the current political time that we're in.
[06:01:03.136 --> 06:01:08.933]   So, I know that it's either out right now or it's coming out... It's out right now, yeah.
[06:01:08.973 --> 06:01:10.715]  Yeah, Alex Jones wrote the foreword of my book.
[06:01:10.775 --> 06:01:14.817]  It's called The Rise of American Populism, a Handbook for Radical Patriotism.
[06:01:14.957 --> 06:01:18.920]  Roger Stone was kind enough to learn the back of it, Gavin McInnes, Jack Posobiec, and others.
[06:01:19.500 --> 06:01:22.262]  And it's a book about exactly what we're witnessing right now.
[06:01:22.402 --> 06:01:26.365]  The American people are fed up with the Democratic establishment and the Republican establishment.
[06:01:26.665 --> 06:01:31.208]  They're realizing that our problems aren't about whether the Democrats or the Republicans are correct.
[06:01:32.034 --> 06:01:34.795]  Our problems are about the people versus the political class.
[06:01:34.815 --> 06:01:35.876]  So thank you for mentioning that, Owen.
[06:01:35.896 --> 06:01:36.576]  It's very kind of you.
[06:01:36.596 --> 06:01:38.116]  I highly encourage everybody to go check it out.
[06:01:38.136 --> 06:01:52.382]  I appreciate it, but please don't get my book until you've at least gone to InfowarsStore.com or DrJonesNaturals.com and gotten something there first, because Alex Jones is a hundred times more powerful than I am, and supporting him is really, really important in this imperative time in our nation's history.
[06:01:52.842 --> 06:02:04.271]  Well, and I'm kind of waiting to put out my prison book because I want to do it real strategically, kind of closer to the election, because it's really going to be a major implication of how Joe Biden has political prisoners.
[06:02:04.751 --> 06:02:07.994]  And I'm thinking I'm going to title it 60 Days a Political Prisoner in Biden's America.
[06:02:08.094 --> 06:02:11.536]  So I think it's I really want it to kind of impact that that moment.
[06:02:11.576 --> 06:02:14.879]  But now it's like, well, Biden might not even be the nominee.
[06:02:15.079 --> 06:02:17.841]  So do you maybe it's in the Democrat run America.
[06:02:17.901 --> 06:02:21.464]  But I do have a perfect shirt for this occasion.
[06:02:22.136 --> 06:02:22.636]  Did you know that?
[06:02:22.696 --> 06:02:24.117]  I have the perfect shirt for people to wear.
[06:02:24.498 --> 06:02:26.279]  Well, it's called the Biden Brain Freeze.
[06:02:26.839 --> 06:02:35.686]  It's the Biden Brain Freeze shirt, and it's only exclusively available, shameless plug here, yes, shameless plug, of course, exclusively available at owensreuerstore.com.
[06:02:35.766 --> 06:02:38.908]  It's the Biden Brain Freeze shirt, and it's perfect for this moment.
[06:02:38.968 --> 06:02:40.129]  It's Biden Brain Freeze.
[06:02:40.209 --> 06:02:42.010]  It says, you know the thing, made in China.
[06:02:42.290 --> 06:02:46.313]  You can only get it at info, or you can only get it at owensreuerstore.com.
[06:02:47.014 --> 06:02:50.016]  We kind of stopped doing t-shirts here at InfoWars.
[06:02:50.416 --> 06:02:58.722]  It was always very popular so I decided to kind of pick up some t-shirts of my own and put them out at owensreuer.store but the Biden brain freeze exclusively there.
[06:02:58.762 --> 06:03:01.144]  Maybe the crew can get it up before we sign off, maybe not.
[06:03:01.884 --> 06:03:05.807]  They've been here all day and they'll be right back up here in the morning.
[06:03:05.867 --> 06:03:12.752]  So the legend of InfoWars lives on and you know it's funny when I'm hearing Alex kind of talk about that yo-yo thing.
[06:03:13.579 --> 06:03:16.481]  As soon as he said yo-yo, I was like, that's exactly it.
[06:03:16.901 --> 06:03:19.522]  I always kind of call it the roller coaster ride of InfoWars.
[06:03:20.083 --> 06:03:21.924]  Or you know, the ship in the perfect storm.
[06:03:22.324 --> 06:03:26.386]  But I think the yo-yo analogy might have been actually the best one.
[06:03:26.546 --> 06:03:27.847]  Because that's kind of what it feels like.
[06:03:27.967 --> 06:03:30.889]  It's like a yo-yo, up, down, up, down.
[06:03:31.729 --> 06:03:42.736]  I don't think everybody in the audience realizes that what they hear about InfoWars is exactly the same as what the crew hears.
[06:03:42.756 --> 06:03:43.977]  Like, we're not in on something.
[06:03:44.277 --> 06:03:47.519]  When you hear that we're closing, we all wonder and fear the same thing.
[06:03:47.559 --> 06:03:49.741]  When you hear that we're going to be okay, we all think the same thing as well.
[06:03:49.761 --> 06:03:54.424]  So, what you've experienced as a listener worried about InfoWars, just imagine what the crew's experience worrying about.
[06:03:54.444 --> 06:03:56.345]  They're going to have a job fighting the good fight.
[06:03:56.365 --> 06:03:59.007]  Alright, well, the crew might have gone completely insane.
[06:04:00.908 --> 06:04:05.431]  They say somebody's back there requesting that we should stay on till we get to a million viewers.
[06:04:05.471 --> 06:04:08.834]  What are we at right now, guys?
[06:04:08.854 --> 06:04:09.954]  Do you know what we're at right now?
[06:04:09.974 --> 06:04:10.755]  Stay on till we raise 1.5.
[06:04:10.915 --> 06:04:10.755]  940?
[06:04:10.995 --> 06:04:12.757]  Oh, wow.
[06:04:13.537 --> 06:04:14.318]  I don't know, guys.
[06:04:14.338 --> 06:04:15.539]  We could be here for a while.
[06:04:16.299 --> 06:04:18.261]  Well, not if everybody who's listening now shares it.
[06:04:18.461 --> 06:04:18.981]  That's true.
[06:04:19.161 --> 06:04:24.946]  If everybody reposts this, we can finally send the crew home, many of which haven't had a break since 8 a.m.
[06:04:26.383 --> 06:04:28.364]  Or haven't even injured them, maybe.
[06:04:28.424 --> 06:04:30.585]  They're up here starving.
[06:04:30.625 --> 06:04:31.245]  Just working.
[06:04:31.265 --> 06:04:31.245]  939,000.
[06:04:33.766 --> 06:04:35.306]  Man, I don't know.
[06:04:35.366 --> 06:04:36.247]  It's midnight.
[06:04:36.267 --> 06:04:37.507]  I don't know if we can get over a million.
[06:04:37.527 --> 06:04:38.207]  Everybody's sleeping.
[06:04:38.227 --> 06:04:42.469]  I just think it's incredible that... The 11th of July.
[06:04:42.489 --> 06:04:44.049]  In 2016, we were by far number one.
[06:04:44.069 --> 06:04:45.750]  It wasn't even close.
[06:04:49.574 --> 06:04:53.955]  Every, every video, just about every video we put up on our YouTube channel would get a million views.
[06:04:53.995 --> 06:04:55.296]  Just about every single one.
[06:04:55.476 --> 06:04:56.796]  In like 24 hours even.
[06:04:57.637 --> 06:05:00.137]  And so, we were just, you know, we had too much of an impact.
[06:05:00.257 --> 06:05:05.099]  And so it's, you know, X is not exactly the same video platform as YouTube obviously.
[06:05:05.699 --> 06:05:14.202]  But the fact now that we're able to go viral on X and get these types of numbers, yeah, they don't like Elon Musk very much.
[06:05:14.708 --> 06:05:15.148]  Absolutely.
[06:05:15.169 --> 06:05:25.197]  Well, the other thing to consider too is YouTube and Instagram and some of the other major social media platforms have totally changed their algorithms and policies to hide political content of any form.
[06:05:25.757 --> 06:05:36.305]   So yes, it's true that we don't have a YouTube account anymore, but basically everybody with a political YouTube channel, with a few notable exceptions, suffering in terms of view counts now. All the political
[06:05:36.305 --> 06:05:40.514]   conversation is happening almost exclusively on X and we are really
[06:05:40.514 --> 06:05:44.613]   dominating there. So where the political conversation is happening in Four Wars is
[06:05:44.613 --> 06:05:47.424]   still way ahead and thank God for Elon Musk making that decision.
[06:05:47.424 --> 06:05:53.224]   I don't think we're quite there yet but there's a threshold that will be
[06:05:53.224 --> 06:05:58.744]   crossed if not in 2028, definitely in the 2030s when it comes to politics and
[06:05:58.744 --> 06:06:03.463]  that's where are people getting their news or more specific.
[06:06:03.302 --> 06:06:07.062]  specifically where people watching political content.
[06:06:07.062 --> 06:06:12.141]   I think that the cable networks, the cable news networks, the TV audience,
[06:06:12.141 --> 06:06:14.543]  I think the threshold changes in 2020.
[06:06:14.543 --> 06:06:16.622]  I don't think we're quite there yet.
[06:06:16.622 --> 06:06:22.062]   I think we're inching closer, but that will be a major, major paradigm shift
[06:06:22.062 --> 06:06:27.222]   when the cable news networks can't dominate the news spectrum, can't dominate the narrative,
[06:06:27.222 --> 06:06:32.582]   and it's independent people, it's alternative news outlets that just need an internet.
[06:06:32.582 --> 06:06:35.582]  They just need an active audience.
[06:06:35.108 --> 06:06:52.903]   Once that changes, you know, that's why censorship is such an important issue to the deep state, the corrupt establishment, because anybody in power really, any tyrants that want to control you, It's such a threat that we can go live right now and get a million people.
[06:06:52.943 --> 06:06:53.763]  We're not supposed to do that.
[06:06:54.184 --> 06:06:55.824]  That's only for the major cable outlets.
[06:06:55.864 --> 06:06:56.925]  That's only for CNN.
[06:06:56.965 --> 06:06:57.965]  That's only for MSNBC.
[06:06:57.985 --> 06:06:59.366]  That's only for the guys that are controlled.
[06:06:59.406 --> 06:07:01.947]  They're allowed to get... You can't be trusted with that.
[06:07:02.448 --> 06:07:04.268]  You can't have that type of influence.
[06:07:04.288 --> 06:07:05.769]  You know, that's the mindset.
[06:07:05.789 --> 06:07:07.430]  That's why the censorship was so important.
[06:07:08.190 --> 06:07:14.557]  And regardless of what you think of Elon Musk, him freeing up X to the extent he has is just paramount.
[06:07:14.938 --> 06:07:15.518]  Paramount!
[06:07:15.678 --> 06:07:19.923]  Can you imagine how things would be going right now if X wasn't acquired?
[06:07:20.635 --> 06:07:23.478]  If Twitter wasn't turned into X, I mean, what will we be looking at?
[06:07:23.498 --> 06:07:24.458]  I'm curious to know what you think.
[06:07:24.558 --> 06:07:30.624]  What will we be looking at in terms of the political conversation if none of these accounts that have been reinstated were reinstated?
[06:07:30.964 --> 06:07:36.188]  If all of the policies about talking about vaccines or whatever would get you shadow banned or literally banned on X?
[06:07:36.249 --> 06:07:46.097]  I mean, if the deep state still had a monopoly on social media like it did before Twitter was acquired and turned into X, what do you think the difference would be politically in terms of real world?
[06:07:47.818 --> 06:07:52.454]   You know, I think, you know, that's what I'm saying is I think we're kind of yet to see that.
[06:07:52.735 --> 06:07:52.915]  Yeah.
[06:07:52.955 --> 06:08:01.705]  I think the big shift was in 2016 and that was the first time the social media world kind of just made that huge crater and impact in the political world.
[06:08:02.265 --> 06:08:05.830]  I think now we're kind of resetting it, revamping it, dealing with the censorship.
[06:08:06.350 --> 06:08:20.734]   I would say though, on a personal level for me, I would not have been able to raise as much awareness for my political persecution and my political imprisonment if it wasn't for me being freed on X. Yeah, we have a huge audience at InfoWars.
[06:08:20.794 --> 06:08:28.361]  We have a bunch of people that go to InfoWars.com every day, band out video every day, but you're kind of reaching the same people, right?
[06:08:28.381 --> 06:08:31.544]  You're reaching the same people and they ban those links on social media.
[06:08:33.234 --> 06:08:43.664]  If it wasn't for X, the political awareness of my case, where a lot of Republican representatives reached out for comment and wanted to talk to me about that, I know that wouldn't have happened.
[06:08:44.706 --> 06:08:50.031]  I probably would not have been able to have near the legal fundraisers so that I could hire lawyers.
[06:08:50.671 --> 06:08:54.195]  So for me personally, it's played a major impact.
[06:08:55.149 --> 06:09:00.778]  And it's really something hard for people to understand until they've been through it.
[06:09:01.339 --> 06:09:08.791]  And that's why so many of these quote-unquote experts that go on mainstream news, specifically I would say Fox in this case because it applies more.
[06:09:09.969 --> 06:09:13.651]  These experts that are so shocked and stunned at everything that's going on with Trump.
[06:09:13.671 --> 06:09:15.652]  Well, you're not the expert.
[06:09:16.232 --> 06:09:18.213]  You haven't been politically persecuted.
[06:09:18.533 --> 06:09:19.993]  You haven't been censored.
[06:09:20.334 --> 06:09:21.874]  You haven't been in prison.
[06:09:22.194 --> 06:09:23.575]  You haven't been censored.
[06:09:24.415 --> 06:09:25.756]  So you haven't been sued.
[06:09:25.996 --> 06:09:27.036]  These aren't the experts.
[06:09:27.437 --> 06:09:28.497]  We're the experts now.
[06:09:29.077 --> 06:09:33.599]  InfoWars, we're the experts for this time we're living in because we've been through it.
[06:09:33.659 --> 06:09:34.980]  We've lived on the battlefield.
[06:09:35.180 --> 06:09:37.703]  Well, inciting the experts is such a cheap shot for so many reasons.
[06:09:37.723 --> 06:09:39.225]  I mean, let's just look at politics specifically.
[06:09:39.064 --> 06:09:42.104]  tower somewhere miles away from the battlefield.
[06:09:42.104 --> 06:09:46.903]   Well, inciting the experts is such a cheap shot for so many reasons.
[06:09:46.903 --> 06:09:50.305]  I mean, let's just look at politics specifically.
[06:09:50.305 --> 06:09:57.123]   How many people have you heard of that majored in political science in college that actually wound up
[06:09:57.123 --> 06:09:58.024]  in a political role?
[06:09:58.024 --> 06:10:02.064]   Not even just a candidate or the president or whatever, but even wound up in any way, shape, or form
[06:10:02.064 --> 06:10:03.864]  in politics as a business?
[06:10:03.864 --> 06:10:09.504]   Like all of the people who've been successful, pundits or politicians, basically for like 100 years,
[06:10:09.504 --> 06:10:11.024]  a lot of them studied law.
[06:10:11.317 --> 06:10:16.581]  But nobody's like the kid, there's always that kid that's like, I'm majoring in poli sci because I want to be president of the United States one day.
[06:10:16.921 --> 06:10:17.742]  It just never plays out.
[06:10:18.703 --> 06:10:20.144]  It's not the experts who innovate.
[06:10:20.284 --> 06:10:27.890]  Experts are notorious for being experts in everything up until this point.
[06:10:28.510 --> 06:10:31.733]  The history of an industry, the history of how things happen, the history of media.
[06:10:32.373 --> 06:10:36.396]  But it's not experts that break through to the other side and innovate what the future looks like.
[06:10:36.476 --> 06:10:48.406]  I mean, Elon Musk has gone from being somebody who started PayPal and then somebody who figured out how to, as a chief engineer, make a rocket land again and then figured out how to buy a social media company and actually make it profitable for the first time.
[06:10:48.426 --> 06:10:53.530]  Twitter was never profitable before and countless other things, none of which he's really credentialed in.
[06:10:53.570 --> 06:11:01.757]  I know he's a different example because he's just like a massive IQ genius level person, but Benjamin Franklin discovered electricity without a degree in electrical engineering.
[06:11:02.898 --> 06:11:03.198]  I don't know.
[06:11:03.218 --> 06:11:05.380]  I think we just need to forget about the experts.
[06:11:05.400 --> 06:11:11.266]  If somebody has reasonable, rational ideas, that's far profitable to somebody who's a total moron that has a piece of paper.
[06:11:11.687 --> 06:11:12.548]  Here's what I think.
[06:11:13.008 --> 06:11:21.116]  This is where the political revolution maybe makes its inroads in the 2024 elections.
[06:11:21.677 --> 06:11:34.906]   And I've talked to quite a few candidates You know, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Troy Nels, Byron Donalds, Ana Paulina Luna, Thomas Massey, this is kind of the exception, right?
[06:11:35.186 --> 06:11:38.829]  This is still the minority of the Republican representative, you know, the Senate.
[06:11:39.790 --> 06:11:44.734]  You've got your Ted Cruz, your Josh Hawley, and they talk a big game.
[06:11:44.754 --> 06:11:51.199]  They've got some actionable deliverables, but much more coming out of the House.
[06:11:52.097 --> 06:12:07.406]  I think what we're potentially looking at is a Republican-led House that has more vocal American patriots who are ready to go on the offense to save our country.
[06:12:07.426 --> 06:12:16.171]  I mean, you get 40, you get 50, and all of a sudden the rest have to play catch-up, or you're just like, you're the outlier now.
[06:12:16.671 --> 06:12:19.273]  And I think that that's kind of what we're on the precipice of.
[06:12:20.026 --> 06:12:28.853]  And then, if the House starts to move like this, the Senate will have to follow, or they're going to be caught with their pants down, not taking any action, and they're going to be embarrassed.
[06:12:29.353 --> 06:12:32.555]  So, you know, that's why I salute the Marjorie Taylor Greene's.
[06:12:33.216 --> 06:12:51.429]   That's why I salute the Thomas Massie's, because they're moving the ball so far downfield, it clears that space behind for these other kind of weak-kneed, cowardly, squished Republicans to finally kind of step up, and at least fill that empty void, but it's like, Much farther down the field than they were before.
[06:12:52.010 --> 06:12:56.993]  So, you know, I really see the peaceful political revolution.
[06:12:57.193 --> 06:12:58.634]  And it doesn't mean it's going to be perfect.
[06:12:58.934 --> 06:12:59.815]  We're not in a cult.
[06:13:00.355 --> 06:13:05.659]  People are still going to have their issues with this policy or that policy or this foreign entanglement, whatever, geopolitics.
[06:13:06.235 --> 06:13:17.324]  But we're finally going to have representatives that sound like us, that talk like us, that think like us, and they actually want to bring that to the House of Representatives.
[06:13:17.624 --> 06:13:19.485]  It's coming to the Attorneys General.
[06:13:20.546 --> 06:13:21.907]  It's coming to school boards.
[06:13:22.848 --> 06:13:28.232]  So I really think if there ever was an opportunity for a red wave, this is the year.
[06:13:28.693 --> 06:13:38.154]   And the only thing stopping it at this point is just total election corruption and Maybe we just hope and pray the Republicans have done enough.
[06:13:39.175 --> 06:13:39.895]  Or for a miracle.
[06:13:40.296 --> 06:13:42.117]  But I see the opportunity there.
[06:13:42.337 --> 06:13:42.737]  I really do.
[06:13:42.777 --> 06:13:46.619]  And I'm not some, oh, political hopeful, like, oh, selling you hopium.
[06:13:47.059 --> 06:13:47.860]  No, I really see it.
[06:13:47.980 --> 06:13:56.325]  I really see people that are running for office that are serious, that love this country, that talk like us, think like us, and want to take that mentality to the Congress.
[06:13:57.005 --> 06:13:57.726]  And you know what?
[06:13:57.846 --> 06:13:59.006]  You know one thing we have in common?
[06:14:00.167 --> 06:14:00.887]  We hate the government.
[06:14:01.468 --> 06:14:01.688]  Yes. 100%.
[06:14:04.079 --> 06:14:15.370]  Well, I think what we're seeing in the Republican Party right now, too, is there's a generation of Republican voters who really trusted the CIA and the FBI and our government.
[06:14:15.410 --> 06:14:20.194]  They were symptoms of Cold War propaganda, US, US, US, US, US.
[06:14:21.736 --> 06:14:24.439]  And they're retiring or frankly dying off.
[06:14:24.679 --> 06:14:46.939]   And so rather than those who would be so offended if you would ever mention, for example, that maybe 9-11 was an inside job because they were patriots and they loved our country and they thought that that was criticizing our country, now you have A generation coming up in the Republican Party that realize that there's a difference between the United States and America, and that the government of the United States is actually an enemy of America.
[06:14:46.959 --> 06:14:48.299]  They don't see them as the same thing anymore.
[06:14:48.599 --> 06:14:50.059]  That's why we're seeing, I think, this shift.
[06:14:50.099 --> 06:14:54.940]  But it's not, it's not like a schism where there's a civil war in our party, like how the left eats the left.
[06:14:55.320 --> 06:14:59.261]  It's almost more like there's a mantle being, or a torch being passed, I think.
[06:14:59.321 --> 06:15:04.402]  Like when you see in an old movie that, you know, a father who's a king passes away and then his son becomes the king.
[06:15:04.722 --> 06:15:06.823]  It's almost like we're getting the ball now.
[06:15:06.863 --> 06:15:11.847]  It's not like we're trying to kill off old Republicans or anything in terms of political power, that we hate them for being neocons.
[06:15:12.227 --> 06:15:20.652]  But there was a major misconception about the nature of our government among Republican voters for decades in this country as a result of a lot of this propaganda.
[06:15:21.032 --> 06:15:21.873]  That is dying off.
[06:15:22.393 --> 06:15:22.874]  I agree.
[06:15:23.214 --> 06:15:27.877]  I think that Trump is kind of the last torchbearer of this generation.
[06:15:28.517 --> 06:15:36.555]   And in a way, he's kind of like the redemption of You know, past generations or the boomer generation or something.
[06:15:36.575 --> 06:15:38.838]  He's kind of like their last redemption in a way.
[06:15:39.378 --> 06:15:41.961]  And then after that, I do think it's the younger generations.
[06:15:42.181 --> 06:15:44.303]  I do think it's the Vivek Ramaswamy's.
[06:15:44.743 --> 06:15:45.924]  It's the Josh Howley's.
[06:15:46.084 --> 06:15:47.286]  It's the Byron Donald's.
[06:15:47.886 --> 06:15:53.692]  You know, I, the Matt Gates, I think that that's the future, but, but this is, this is kind of Trump is the guy.
[06:15:54.392 --> 06:15:58.196]  Everybody at this point is behind him and it's like, okay.
[06:15:58.979 --> 06:16:11.287]  Make that one last, give this generation of conservatives one last thrust for patriotism and conservative politics, and then pass the torch down, and we're gonna be the next standard bearer.
[06:16:11.627 --> 06:16:26.617]  The one promise, the one promise that Trump made to the American people that's the most important, that's the most important, and it will be his most difficult, is he said he's gonna give the country back to us, he's gonna give our government back to us.
[06:16:27.344 --> 06:16:29.124]  That's the most important promise he ever made.
[06:16:29.144 --> 06:16:39.646]  It's gonna be the most difficult thing he's ever had to deliver on, but I think that's what he really needs to focus on if he gets in there again.
[06:16:39.906 --> 06:16:43.887]  Well, he has absolutely no incentive to do anything other than that, too.
[06:16:43.907 --> 06:16:45.147]  That's one of the reasons why I'm voting for him.
[06:16:45.167 --> 06:16:50.708]  First of all, all the world's supervillains hate him, so that's the only reason anyone should really need to vote for him, right?
[06:16:50.728 --> 06:16:53.529]  All the most evil people in the world absolutely hate him, exclusively him, too.
[06:16:54.369 --> 06:16:55.829]  And the other thing is, he doesn't need the money.
[06:16:56.508 --> 06:16:57.989]  He doesn't need anything else.
[06:16:58.009 --> 06:16:59.149]  People criticize him for his ego.
[06:16:59.169 --> 06:17:02.670]  His ego is one of the reasons why I'm voting for him because all he cares about is his legacy.
[06:17:03.091 --> 06:17:06.312]  And he wants to go down in history as the best President of the United States.
[06:17:06.332 --> 06:17:07.492]  He even said it tonight during the debate.
[06:17:07.772 --> 06:17:08.913]  And I like that about him.
[06:17:09.053 --> 06:17:14.515]  I want people to be President of the United States that want to be remembered as the best President in the history of America.
[06:17:14.815 --> 06:17:14.915]  Right?
[06:17:14.935 --> 06:17:16.596]  That's a good thing that they want to do a good job.
[06:17:16.616 --> 06:17:18.376]  So he's got no incentive to sell us out.
[06:17:18.416 --> 06:17:23.598]  He doesn't need to do any of this insider trading BS like Joe Biden or Nancy Pelosi or Dan Crenshaw or others.
[06:17:24.078 --> 06:17:31.402]   This is somebody who is Not only trying to save his own legacy, but realizes that the only way to do that is to save the country.
[06:17:31.462 --> 06:17:35.243]  He genuinely loves the country, and I think you're right, man.
[06:17:35.263 --> 06:17:45.688]  This is the old guard shifting us in the right direction right before they hand the ship over to us, and I think Trump is setting us on the right course, and we have to do everything we can to support him.
[06:17:46.088 --> 06:17:57.477]  Okay, well the next big developments inevitably are gonna be the Supreme Court decisions on Trump's immunity and and some other things and then of course Do they put Trump in jail on July 11th?
[06:17:57.517 --> 06:18:01.681]  Those are the two big things in the near future That are gonna have the most impact.
[06:18:01.701 --> 06:18:13.948]   All right, we've gone beyond midnight Ceremoniously, we've hit a million live audience on X and so we're gonna send the crew home I want to give big ups to the crew tonight Uh, working all day.

[06:18:56.511 --> 06:18:57.632]  They haven't shut us down yet.
[06:18:57.712 --> 06:19:00.833]  We never stop going live even despite the censorship and the attacks.

[06:19:07.537 --> 06:19:08.798]  The Alex Jones Show as well.
[06:19:09.738 --> 06:19:11.339]  And so we will see you then.
[06:19:11.919 --> 06:19:12.580]  God bless.
[06:19:13.300 --> 06:19:13.760]  Good night.
[06:19:14.501 --> 06:19:17.140]  And Godspeed from all of us here at InfoWars.
[06:19:17.140 --> 06:19:27.140]  [MUSIC]
[06:19:27.140 --> 06:19:39.860]   This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas.
[06:19:40.040 --> 06:19:47.784]  resistance against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big mega banks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[06:19:47.984 --> 06:19:51.246]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[06:19:51.266 --> 06:19:52.707]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[06:19:53.067 --> 06:19:54.988]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[06:19:55.229 --> 06:19:57.350]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[06:19:57.570 --> 06:19:58.631]  This is all confirmed.
[06:19:58.671 --> 06:19:59.612]  This is not a drill.
[06:19:59.752 --> 06:20:03.714]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[06:20:04.014 --> 06:20:05.435]  They've officially become state-run.
[06:20:05.576 --> 06:20:05.816]  Apple 100%.
[06:20:05.856 --> 06:20:12.100]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[06:20:12.520 --> 06:20:15.062]  They are now beta testing using me as a straw man.
[06:20:15.462 --> 06:20:17.264]  A demonized version of Alex Jones to do that.
[06:20:17.584 --> 06:20:18.464]  This is happening.
[06:20:18.484 --> 06:20:26.570]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[06:20:26.630 --> 06:20:32.455]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[06:20:32.855 --> 06:20:40.821]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion paradigm manipulation.
[06:20:41.698 --> 06:20:45.200]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[06:20:45.500 --> 06:20:48.701]  We adapt to being pressed to low dosages of oppression.
[06:20:49.001 --> 06:20:54.604]  Now, when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infused
