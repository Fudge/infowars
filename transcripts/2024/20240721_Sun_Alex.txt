[00:00:04.774 --> 00:00:06.915]  It's Sunday, July 21st, 2024.
[00:00:07.075 --> 00:00:12.676]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we are transmitting worldwide.
[00:00:13.376 --> 00:00:14.356]  And we are the resistance.
[00:00:15.097 --> 00:00:19.258]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:22.098 --> 00:00:22.718]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:26.839]  Your 106 days.
[00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.260]  The most important election in world history.
[00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:32.801]  You can tag another.
[00:00:34.126 --> 00:00:44.632]  79 days onto that, once President Trump is President-elect, you are witnessing America fighting for its life to remove the deep state face sucker that is the New World Order.
[00:00:46.493 --> 00:01:06.925]   All right, I have worked particularly hard yesterday and today getting on the telephone with my Pentagon sources in Delta Force, Army Special Operations, the Navy SEALs, But not just the operators also top former brass.
[00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:09.767]  Defense intelligence I have spent.
[00:01:11.348 --> 00:01:12.489]  To my wife's chagrin.
[00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.432]  I would say 15 hours, not just counting three hour show yesterday.
[00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:18.513]  I'm not bragging.
[00:01:18.553 --> 00:01:21.955]  I'm saying I'm in the game here.
[00:01:21.975 --> 00:01:22.315]  15 hours.
[00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:24.717]  Locked in my office.
[00:01:26.018 --> 00:01:28.860]  Last night, yesterday afternoon and today.
[00:01:31.462 --> 00:01:38.429]   I've spent eight hours today at least And I have talked to a lot of people.
[00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.634]  I've talked to the folks in Trump's immediate command system, right at the top.
[00:01:47.295 --> 00:01:51.058]  And I have talked to the individuals that are deploying to defend Trump.
[00:01:53.199 --> 00:02:02.746]  And they don't even need to be a secret where I can give specifics of it, but he is bringing in the orange group out of the Pentagon.
[00:02:04.315 --> 00:02:05.015]  The Delta Force.
[00:02:06.156 --> 00:02:08.937]  But because he can't get the current ones, he's getting even better.
[00:02:09.037 --> 00:02:12.059]  He's getting the super seasoned ones.
[00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:14.680]  And I'm not saying Delta Force is bad, but these are the guys.
[00:02:15.981 --> 00:02:18.882]  And the best Navy SEALs, and Eric Prince is involved.
[00:02:20.923 --> 00:02:24.425]  I told you that I thought Biden, within two weeks, would step down.
[00:02:24.485 --> 00:02:28.207]  I said, this weekend, the weekend of the 20th and 21st, it happened today, as I called.
[00:02:28.227 --> 00:02:29.908]  It's like I just see all the numbers.
[00:02:30.868 --> 00:02:33.210]  And it would take hours to explain how I know that, but there you go.
[00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.790]  It happened again.
[00:02:35.171 --> 00:02:40.055]  And I talked to high-level people in the Trump administration, the soon-to-be administration.
[00:02:40.796 --> 00:02:46.540]  And I talked to high-level people in every facet of the system.
[00:02:47.761 --> 00:02:52.385]  And then they gave me a list of people that could speak because they're not currently in the military.
[00:02:53.126 --> 00:02:54.367]  And these are amazing people.
[00:02:55.908 --> 00:02:56.749]  Some are coming on tonight.
[00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.931]  I'm not going to announce who they are until tomorrow.
[00:03:00.892 --> 00:03:08.309]   But on tomorrow's show, we're going to have People that have commanded major operations around the world.
[00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.152]  And for anybody that follows military news, you will know who they are.
[00:03:12.172 --> 00:03:15.914]  In fact, the general public will know who will know who they are.
[00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:18.835]  So they're going to be on the show tomorrow.
[00:03:20.456 --> 00:03:22.057]  Lord willing, who knows what the Globals will do.
[00:03:24.438 --> 00:03:29.701]  But you have Senator Johnson coming out and saying that the deep state tried to kill Trump.
[00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:30.562]  It was an inside job.
[00:03:31.397 --> 00:03:33.138]  You have Senator Hawley saying there's a cover-up.
[00:03:33.158 --> 00:03:33.799]  He went to the site.
[00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:36.120]  You have Congressman Mills saying that.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.201]  He's a former sniper commander of operations.
[00:03:40.963 --> 00:03:46.366]  And then you have Trump saying if he would have been told there was a guy on the roof, he wouldn't have come out, but they didn't even tell him when they knew.
[00:03:46.466 --> 00:03:48.708]  So he was on the roof before Trump even came out.
[00:03:49.648 --> 00:03:50.289]  It was all timed.
[00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.793]  And the best knowledge is there was a shooter right under the shooter who was on the roof in the window.
[00:03:58.578 --> 00:04:02.240]  That's what the acoustics are showing and a shooter on the water tower.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.421]  We have the HD video of that coming up.
[00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:05.421]  It's clearly on a shadow.
[00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:06.662]  Now it's been blown up digitally.
[00:04:07.942 --> 00:04:08.543]  Stepping out.
[00:04:08.863 --> 00:04:10.324]  In fact, I meant to send you guys that clip.
[00:04:10.344 --> 00:04:11.044]  Have Rob do grab it.
[00:04:11.064 --> 00:04:16.446]  It's all over X. The water tower zoom in showing the shooter up there with his rifle.
[00:04:17.907 --> 00:04:21.549]  And the FBI is there covering it all up, keeping even senators back.
[00:04:22.657 --> 00:04:26.618]  They're now trying to move the position of where Crooks, the Patsy, was.
[00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:30.240]  This is going to be one hell of a transmission tonight.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.062]  And we have a bunch of huge special operations guests, special operations colonels coming on.
[00:04:37.242 --> 00:04:37.782]  You name it.
[00:04:38.502 --> 00:04:43.064]  Then I'll have to go some into the third hour and fourth hour, but Chase will be here for that as well.
[00:04:44.431 --> 00:04:45.111]  Please stay with us.
[00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:46.131]  This is so important.
[00:04:46.232 --> 00:04:48.192]  And boost this information.
[00:04:48.232 --> 00:04:49.132]  Listen to local station.
[00:04:49.312 --> 00:04:50.313]  Tell everybody about how you're listening.
[00:04:50.853 --> 00:04:52.373]  At the grocery store, gas station, amen.
[00:04:52.393 --> 00:04:55.214]  If you're listening on X at Real Alex Jones, share that link.
[00:04:55.794 --> 00:04:56.714]  Or Real Alex Jones.
[00:04:58.095 --> 00:05:04.397]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:05:04.877 --> 00:05:09.818]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:13.815 --> 00:05:19.959]  I've got a billion places I could go, but I'm going to be very, very focused here for you and try to go right down the line.
[00:05:21.981 --> 00:05:46.152]   I have spent at least 15, 14 hours or so in the last two days reaching out to my sources in the Trump campaign at the highest levels and to my sources in the premier military organization, the United States Delta Force, the Navy SEALs, and they Many of them are still in, so they would defer and give me numbers to call.
[00:05:46.853 --> 00:05:51.095]  And a lot of these people I talk to are household names, if you're in the military community.
[00:05:51.535 --> 00:05:52.536]  And they're all coming on the show.
[00:05:53.036 --> 00:05:54.077]  Two big ones tomorrow.
[00:05:54.537 --> 00:05:56.178]  Bunch of big Patriots today.
[00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:00.300]  Tonight on this live Sunday, July 21st transmission.
[00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:06.370]  But you have Senator Johnson coming out saying clearly it's an inside job attempt to kill Trump.
[00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:12.151]  You have Trump saying that now the Secret Service stood down and didn't tell him there was a shooter on the roof before he even came out.
[00:06:12.191 --> 00:06:13.971]  They got the shooter in place and brought Trump out.
[00:06:13.991 --> 00:06:17.272]  You have the acoustics of a shooter below in the window right below the shooter.
[00:06:17.892 --> 00:06:22.513]  Now because the trajectory comes from that point, they're trying to move the trajectory of where the shooter was.
[00:06:23.033 --> 00:06:23.953]  This is incredible.
[00:06:23.993 --> 00:06:26.833]  But bottom line, we have to admit they tried to kill Trump.
[00:06:27.213 --> 00:06:28.254]  This is a deep state operation.
[00:06:28.294 --> 00:06:29.934]  Now that consensus is formed.
[00:06:33.524 --> 00:06:35.145]  Then you've got everything else.
[00:06:35.925 --> 00:06:41.369]  As I predicted two weeks ago, Biden would resign on the weekend of the 20th and 21st.
[00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:43.250]  He resigned today.
[00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:46.011]  As the nominee.
[00:06:49.133 --> 00:06:49.673]  That happened.
[00:06:52.095 --> 00:06:53.516]  And that's a whole other thing to unpack.
[00:06:54.336 --> 00:06:55.637]  We'll be going over all of that.
[00:06:58.038 --> 00:06:59.419]  But I want to be 100% clear here.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.545]   Two weeks ago, I said, Obama wants Biden to resign.
[00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:07.265]  People said, well, Obama's defending him.
[00:07:07.725 --> 00:07:17.869]  I said, all of his surrogates that work for him say you must resign, because Obama doesn't want to get the heat.
[00:07:18.269 --> 00:07:18.609]  Obama.
[00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.811]  So now you have Hillary and Bill and Obama saying they are endorsing Kamala.
[00:07:25.692 --> 00:07:27.332]  That means they're going to gun for Kamala.
[00:07:27.713 --> 00:07:31.034]  And I know because hundreds of articles were written in the last 48 hours.
[00:07:33.061 --> 00:07:45.630]  Saying Hillary Clinton should be who replaces Joe Biden and that Kamala's an idiot.
[00:07:45.930 --> 00:08:00.220]  So while they're saying in the news the Clintons and the Democratic establishment is backing Kamala, their surrogates that they control are unified saying Kamala did a terrible job in a meeting today with donors and Kamala's an idiot and people don't think she can win.
[00:08:01.866 --> 00:08:06.815]  So, I'm not saying Hillary will replace her because they're not God, they're not all powerful.
[00:08:08.317 --> 00:08:09.980]  But if Hillary doesn't get exposed...
[00:08:11.215 --> 00:08:16.598]  Ahead of their convention in a few weeks in Chicago, that is who they're planning to replace with.
[00:08:16.998 --> 00:08:20.701]  And they got Big Mike and Gavin Newsom and Whitmer and all the rest of it, and maybe Kamala's the person.
[00:08:21.301 --> 00:08:28.885]  But they don't run hundreds of articles in the last 48 hours, starting Friday, saying Hillary's the one, she won the popular vote, she's great, she's wonderful.
[00:08:29.446 --> 00:08:30.366]  That's control.
[00:08:30.406 --> 00:08:31.287]  That's a signal.
[00:08:31.927 --> 00:08:32.107]  That's 100%.
[00:08:33.228 --> 00:08:35.169]  They don't run that signal unless they're planning that.
[00:08:36.009 --> 00:08:37.430]  So you say, how do you predict this stuff?
[00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:38.391]  I know the signals.
[00:08:39.517 --> 00:08:41.880]  That doesn't mean we can't override the signals.
[00:08:43.462 --> 00:08:44.644]  But those are signals.
[00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:53.636]  When he came out on the 17th, Wednesday, Biden, and said I'm sick with that X post on formerly Twitter.
[00:08:55.459 --> 00:08:58.779]   And when he Then said, Oh, yeah, I've got COVID.
[00:08:58.819 --> 00:09:00.999]  And if I'm sick, I may step down.
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.500]  I said, that's him sending a signal.
[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.321]  The establishment turned the heat off.
[00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:05.981]  I've given up.
[00:09:06.241 --> 00:09:07.241]  He resigned Wednesday.
[00:09:07.621 --> 00:09:08.342]  I said that Wednesday.
[00:09:08.682 --> 00:09:09.682]  He resigned Wednesday.
[00:09:09.702 --> 00:09:16.284]  And I said, just as I said on weeks ago, I said Wednesday, we'll play a clip in a moment.
[00:09:17.684 --> 00:09:19.165]  And I said it again Friday in studio.
[00:09:20.605 --> 00:09:21.926]  He will resign this weekend.
[00:09:22.226 --> 00:09:22.766]  And it happened.
[00:09:24.209 --> 00:09:26.271]  That's not psychic powers.
[00:09:26.311 --> 00:09:27.512]  That's being in the game.
[00:09:32.356 --> 00:09:36.060]  Turns out the Patriots coach didn't have to cheat that much.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:44.527]  He just spent more time than anybody else having people videotape practices and seeing what signs they did and how they lined up for each play.
[00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.750]  Belichick.
[00:09:51.584 --> 00:09:52.264]  That's what I do.
[00:09:53.445 --> 00:09:55.327]  I watch the enemy constantly.
[00:09:55.407 --> 00:09:56.007]  I can't help it.
[00:09:57.088 --> 00:09:59.529]  My wife yesterday and today, she's like, you're locked in your office.
[00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:00.310]  She loves me.
[00:10:01.691 --> 00:10:04.813]  And she said, you got to have faith in God.
[00:10:04.833 --> 00:10:05.393]  You got to stop.
[00:10:06.354 --> 00:10:10.977]  Because I literally would come out and get a sandwich every five hours or a glass of iced tea.
[00:10:10.997 --> 00:10:11.798]  And she said, well, you stop.
[00:10:11.858 --> 00:10:12.698]  And I said, I can't stop.
[00:10:12.718 --> 00:10:16.481]  You have to understand what I do on air is a secondary byproduct.
[00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:22.693]  My real operations is constant research up to 6, 7, 8, 10 hours a day.
[00:10:24.755 --> 00:10:26.256]  And that's how I'm calling all this.
[00:10:29.638 --> 00:10:31.659]  So, I'm not saying Hillary will be the nominee.
[00:10:31.699 --> 00:10:40.105]  They're going to try to say Harris is the nominee, undermine her, but say there's going to be an open process at the DNC.
[00:10:40.165 --> 00:10:41.166]  And this may change tomorrow.
[00:10:41.186 --> 00:10:42.526]  They may change their view.
[00:10:42.567 --> 00:10:47.650]  But the propaganda they put out, pre-programming ahead of it, tells you what they want.
[00:10:49.096 --> 00:10:53.739]  You can't always get what you want, but you get what you need.
[00:10:55.641 --> 00:10:58.183]  Which is after we convict you legally and lawfully at the end of a rope.
[00:11:00.164 --> 00:11:02.786]  So these are possible futures that they want.
[00:11:03.106 --> 00:11:05.808]  I know what the enemy wants from their operations.
[00:11:05.848 --> 00:11:08.570]  It doesn't mean they're God and those things are going to happen.
[00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:13.174]  But for 30 years, I make predictions and almost all of them come true because the bad guys get what they want.
[00:11:16.056 --> 00:11:20.766]   But you notice more and more, They're not getting what they want.
[00:11:23.448 --> 00:11:26.209]  So we're going to go over all of this here today.
[00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:29.571]  And boy, do we have a raft of guests today that are amazing.
[00:11:32.173 --> 00:11:36.976]  We have Quentin Carter, who's worked in these different groups and organizations.
[00:11:38.216 --> 00:11:41.318]  Ivan Reikland, Green Beret Defense Intelligence.
[00:11:42.299 --> 00:11:45.100]  Doc Chambers, Lieutenant Colonel, Army Special Operations.
[00:11:46.321 --> 00:11:47.042]  Roger Stone.
[00:11:48.123 --> 00:11:51.625]  And then tomorrow, I'm not going to tell you who we have on.
[00:11:52.866 --> 00:11:58.109]  They were both ready to do it, but one was in the air, and another was getting back to their home.
[00:11:58.989 --> 00:12:01.590]  I decided to do this tomorrow with these guests I'll announce then.
[00:12:02.511 --> 00:12:04.592]  And they are household names in the military.
[00:12:06.433 --> 00:12:08.594]  And they concur with my analysis 100%.
[00:12:10.134 --> 00:12:11.134]  The Deep State did this.
[00:12:11.154 --> 00:12:12.115]  There was a stand down.
[00:12:12.395 --> 00:12:13.175]  The shooter had help.
[00:12:13.555 --> 00:12:14.875]  Jack Posobiec has federal sources.
[00:12:15.515 --> 00:12:16.656]  Similar sources told me.
[00:12:17.256 --> 00:12:18.676]  They went to this guy's car and house.
[00:12:18.736 --> 00:12:21.437]  Sophisticated, military-grade explosives.
[00:12:22.437 --> 00:12:23.858]  Not just explosive design.
[00:12:26.198 --> 00:12:27.179]  Plastic explosives.
[00:12:27.959 --> 00:12:29.079]  Military explosives.
[00:12:29.179 --> 00:12:33.440]  He had a drone over the facility an hour before Trump came out.
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:34.621]  They stood down.
[00:12:34.661 --> 00:12:35.161]  They waited.
[00:12:35.181 --> 00:12:36.121]  They ordered the stand down.
[00:12:36.721 --> 00:12:37.862]  They had a bunch of fake security.
[00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:39.122]  They couldn't even re-holster their gun.
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:44.302]  They had a shooter on top of the roof, took him forever to get him in place.
[00:12:44.682 --> 00:12:47.064]  Soon as he shot, the other people shot, but they missed.
[00:12:47.725 --> 00:12:50.987]  One hit the lectern, one hit Trump in the ear, others hit the crowd.
[00:12:53.229 --> 00:12:56.511]  This is an incredible moment to be alive.
[00:12:56.551 --> 00:13:02.615]  There's a meme I put on X today, we'll show it again, that shows the shot that hit Trump and it says, cheaper groceries.
[00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:06.178]  If he gets elected, it just skips his, nicks his ear.
[00:13:07.999 --> 00:13:10.101]  But if it hits him in the brain, you get Civil War.
[00:13:11.021 --> 00:13:17.504]  They were going to kill Trump, blow his head off on TV like JFK in 63, show the SubRudder film when you get a chance.
[00:13:18.565 --> 00:13:24.108]  And they were going to then do a bunch of false flags to legitimize it and maybe even kill Biden.
[00:13:26.929 --> 00:13:40.456]  But now they had multiple shooters, probably three, just like with Kennedy, triangulation in Dallas, Texas, 63, but bare minimum two from the acoustics and all my sources and what's coming out, the man on the water tower, a man at the window, right under the shooter, above him on the roof.
[00:13:42.116 --> 00:13:53.844]  And the default, and I've talked to all these top famous snipers, and you'll hear their names, you'll see it all, it's incredible, and they said the default, a couple of them are watching live, was why is nobody on the water tower?
[00:13:53.864 --> 00:13:54.625]  Oh, there is somebody there.
[00:13:55.586 --> 00:13:59.188]  Why is nobody on top of those buildings, 450 feet from the president?
[00:14:00.749 --> 00:14:15.041]   They opened the door for this, New Yorkers are supposed to control this, so Trump has wisely brought in private security, the guys that are former Delta Force, and you're never former, And now Trump is going to be hard to hit.
[00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:18.605]  And the experts said, we agree with your analysis, next will be poison.
[00:14:19.385 --> 00:14:20.366]  He can't shake hands.
[00:14:20.687 --> 00:14:22.629]  They'll have a fake glove, looks like a normal skin.
[00:14:22.649 --> 00:14:24.931]  It'll have pure fentanyl or some other drug.
[00:14:25.272 --> 00:14:27.214]  Trump shakes their hand, he's dead in 10 minutes.
[00:14:29.736 --> 00:14:33.360]  They have chemicals with acids with cyanide looking through the skin or fentanyl.
[00:14:33.881 --> 00:14:34.842]  It'll be weaponized.
[00:14:36.325 --> 00:14:41.086]  Fast action, pure cyanide or pure fentanyl with an acid to get through Trump's skin.
[00:14:41.647 --> 00:14:44.187]  It looked like a hand, but it's a plastic glove.
[00:14:44.207 --> 00:14:44.808]  Looks like a hand.
[00:14:46.188 --> 00:14:47.969]  He shakes somebody's hand, he's dead in 10 minutes.
[00:14:48.609 --> 00:14:49.389]  Five minutes, probably.
[00:14:49.409 --> 00:14:49.809]  Maybe two.
[00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:52.250]  Truck bombs.
[00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:54.491]  Tactical nukes blamed on Iran.
[00:14:55.051 --> 00:14:56.351]  I told you last week they'll blame Iran.
[00:14:56.371 --> 00:14:57.272]  They already tried the next day.
[00:14:58.092 --> 00:14:59.252]  I'm on top of their pre-programming.
[00:15:00.353 --> 00:15:01.993]  All right, go ahead and get Quentin Carter on.
[00:15:03.534 --> 00:15:04.854]  I want to play these two clips for you.
[00:15:06.175 --> 00:15:07.056]  Here is a clip.
[00:15:09.878 --> 00:15:14.961]  Last week, where I said, talking about the previous prediction, we're posting all the originals now on XRLOG Jones.
[00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:25.709]  Alex Jones predicts Biden would drop out by July 20th or 21st and then play clip one from a month ago or 29 days ago in Detroit.
[00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:33.114]  I spoke after Trump, right before JD Vance, had a great meeting with him there.
[00:15:33.174 --> 00:15:33.995]  He said, yeah, I'm the nominee.
[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.860]  I saw such incredible deep state pressure last week.
[00:15:35.679 --> 00:15:36.679]  I want you to have the nominee.
[00:15:36.679 --> 00:15:37.679]  Great, wow.
[00:15:37.679 --> 00:15:43.719]  But just telling you, we're in the White House, folks.
[00:15:43.719 --> 00:15:44.719]  We're in the new White House.
[00:15:44.719 --> 00:15:47.959]   It's not like some fake guy on 4chan saying he's on the inside.
[00:15:47.959 --> 00:15:48.959]  We're here, right here.
[00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:49.959]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:15:49.959 --> 00:15:53.279]   Alex Jones, they're going to try to assassinate President Trump.
[00:15:53.279 --> 00:15:54.279]  Here it is.
[00:15:54.279 --> 00:15:55.279]  We'll get our guest on.
[00:15:55.279 --> 00:15:57.279]  I saw such incredible deep state pressure last week.
[00:15:57.279 --> 00:16:06.079]   I said, I think Biden will be gone by the, I think I said the 20th or 21st.
[00:16:06.034 --> 00:16:09.776]  According to multiple Democratic sources, this is happening all of a sudden.
[00:16:09.816 --> 00:16:12.738]  Everyone said it would happen gradually and then all at once, and that's what's happening.
[00:16:13.038 --> 00:16:17.280]  According to my sources, President Biden has agreed to step down as a Democratic nominee.
[00:16:18.041 --> 00:16:19.622]  It will happen as early as this weekend.
[00:16:19.662 --> 00:16:21.203]  A speech has been drafted for him.
[00:16:22.023 --> 00:16:27.086]  Alex, I have to say, I have to say, I have to ask you, and I'm going to interview you for a minute, Alex.
[00:16:28.257 --> 00:16:33.102]  What do you think they'll do to President Trump between now and election day?
[00:16:33.723 --> 00:16:34.584]  You're reading my mind.
[00:16:35.065 --> 00:16:35.785]  What will they do to him?
[00:16:36.526 --> 00:16:41.712]  God literally gave us Donald Trump, imperfect as most men or women that God raises up in history.
[00:16:42.327 --> 00:16:44.408]  But he is a man of steel.
[00:16:44.788 --> 00:16:46.929]  He is a man who has ice water in his veins.
[00:16:47.329 --> 00:16:49.890]  He is a man who gets stronger under attack.
[00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:56.173]  And so they have already put him through hell with all these show trials and rigged courts, civil and criminal.
[00:16:56.533 --> 00:16:59.094]  And they are going to try to assassinate President Trump.
[00:16:59.454 --> 00:17:00.875]  Make no mistake about that.
[00:17:01.195 --> 00:17:03.656]  They are going to try to pull out all the stops.
[00:17:03.876 --> 00:17:07.818]  And so we've got to pray for President Trump many times a day.
[00:17:09.558 --> 00:17:30.457]   And we've got to bust We've got to bust our rear ends to get out there in America because the people are waking up and they're ready to become fully awake and let them know that the WF and the UN and Bill Gates have said they're bringing new lockdowns, more forced injections, they're cutting off the farms, they're cutting off the energy.
[00:17:31.187 --> 00:17:36.911]  And if you think the economy in free fall right now is bad, it is going to be ten times worse.
[00:17:36.991 --> 00:17:38.552]  So this is existential.
[00:17:38.912 --> 00:17:44.956]  We are at war with the globalists, and we must now recognize that this is a war.
[00:17:45.196 --> 00:17:53.342]  This is just as important as 1776, and in the context of the population of the world, the weapons we have now, it is more important.
[00:17:53.622 --> 00:17:59.827]  This is a continuation of the fight between free open societies and tyrannical world government.
[00:18:00.067 --> 00:18:09.154]  And the left represents the most evil, wicked, anti-free market corporations on the planet, led by BlackRock, that thinks it controls your life.
[00:18:10.195 --> 00:18:13.557]  I've been on air 30 plus years.
[00:18:15.019 --> 00:18:19.182]  And I am realizing now, this is my final mission.
[00:18:20.233 --> 00:18:24.876]  The next few months, I'll stay on air after this, but if we win this, get Trump in, we're going to turn the tide.
[00:18:24.896 --> 00:18:28.077]  I'll still be on air, but I can tell you, this is go hour right now.
[00:18:28.698 --> 00:18:29.558]  This is everything.
[00:18:29.578 --> 00:18:31.259]  This is George Washington 2.0.
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.841]  God's hand is on us right now.
[00:18:34.861 --> 00:18:37.643]  A good friend of mine, known him many years, Quentin Carter.
[00:18:37.663 --> 00:18:41.084]  A lot of what he did was secret, won't say everything he did, but U.S.
[00:18:41.165 --> 00:18:48.449]  Army, CFC, retired reconnaissance platoon sergeant, highly decorated, DOS contractor, executive protection specialist.
[00:18:49.825 --> 00:18:54.169]  20 plus people I talked to in the last 24 hours and they all concur.
[00:18:54.189 --> 00:18:55.210]  There's a total consensus.
[00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:57.212]  We're going to have a huge guest coming up as well.
[00:18:57.612 --> 00:19:06.019]  But I want to get Quentin on first because he was watching it with his wife when it happened and when it went down and everything he thought he saw was exactly what I got from other sources.
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.662]  But I wanted to call him because he's somebody I personally knew.
[00:19:09.462 --> 00:19:11.024]  Quentin, good to talk to you, my friend.
[00:19:11.064 --> 00:19:14.288]  What do you make of the situation and the different angles we see here?
[00:19:14.328 --> 00:19:17.411]  And even Senator Johnson coming out saying this is a deep state attempt at coup.
[00:19:17.451 --> 00:19:21.916]  I think it's critical to say that and admit that, to let the enemy know we know.
[00:19:21.936 --> 00:19:24.979]  And so if they kill Trump, it's that much worse for them.
[00:19:26.508 --> 00:19:27.128]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:19:27.409 --> 00:19:29.150]  First and foremost, thanks for having me back on.
[00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:31.311]  We spent many years together working.
[00:19:32.192 --> 00:19:38.395]  A lot of people will remember that when this very first started, I started working with you at the RNC when Trump was first elected.
[00:19:39.256 --> 00:19:48.521]  So we've been through this for quite some time now, you and I. And we've had multiple discussions and conversations about the fact that they weren't going to allow this to happen.
[00:19:49.222 --> 00:19:50.503]  I talked to you a month ago.
[00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:52.304]  I talked to you a month ago and I said they're going to kill Trump.
[00:19:52.324 --> 00:19:52.624]  You agreed.
[00:19:53.672 --> 00:19:54.072]  Guaranteed.
[00:19:54.532 --> 00:19:58.214]  We all knew that there would be an attempt on him at best.
[00:19:58.354 --> 00:20:02.816]  Now, knowing who they are and how they're going to try things, I didn't think they would be successful as they weren't.
[00:20:03.556 --> 00:20:05.257]  But we knew that they were going to try.
[00:20:06.037 --> 00:20:10.939]  The only way that they can continue to try to control the masses is to keep us separated.
[00:20:11.219 --> 00:20:18.280]   And I think that their failed assassination attempt of Donald Trump Did exactly the opposite of what they wanted.
[00:20:18.361 --> 00:20:25.466]  They thought they were going to do something and draw a line between us, and all they've done is create a line where now people are switching over.
[00:20:25.566 --> 00:20:33.313]  So you have, you know, people that were somewhere in the purple or even hard left-leaning all coming back our way.
[00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:36.255]  And we did talk about this a month ago.
[00:20:36.355 --> 00:20:43.481]  We had a long conversation of trying to look forward and see what was going on, and we knew this was going to happen.
[00:20:43.561 --> 00:20:47.501]   It was just a matter of how or what I thought it would be poison from the beginning.
[00:20:48.981 --> 00:20:58.904]  The fact that they tried it with a very sorry excuse of a marksman just blows my mind.
[00:20:59.525 --> 00:21:06.147]  If you listen to any of the audio that we hear, there is clearly more than one shooter.
[00:21:07.887 --> 00:21:11.810]  You don't have to be in a band to know the difference between guitars and drums, right?
[00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:20.096]  So if you listen to the audio, you can tell that it's two entirely distinctly different sets of gunshots.
[00:21:20.176 --> 00:21:25.060]  Two different reports, and absolutely.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:33.966]  And we said today, we talked this day, all the people I talked to agreed they wanted a spectacular event blowing his head off to try to inflame, and that was their next plan.
[00:21:34.026 --> 00:21:34.547]  But keep going.
[00:21:35.737 --> 00:21:37.178]  Yeah, I agree with that as well.
[00:21:37.258 --> 00:21:49.677]   So when we look at it in the totality or the visual performance of this, an average person is Going to go for that headshot.
[00:21:49.757 --> 00:21:52.098]  They want the visual of that.
[00:21:52.158 --> 00:21:59.321]  They want the JFK version 2.0, whereas a true trained assassin wouldn't go for a headshot.
[00:21:59.501 --> 00:22:03.403]  A true trained assassin, someone wants to do it, they're looking for a death shot.
[00:22:03.583 --> 00:22:06.284]  They're looking for something that has finality to it.
[00:22:06.324 --> 00:22:09.206]  And it's not hard to hit a human being at 130 or 150 yards.
[00:22:09.226 --> 00:22:10.626]  You and I used to shoot together all the time.
[00:22:15.015 --> 00:22:21.637]  I remember us shooting Coke cans at 7 and 750, untrained, sitting in the front seat of a Jeep.
[00:22:21.777 --> 00:22:23.718]  So it's really not a hard thing.
[00:22:24.618 --> 00:22:29.380]  You and I both have shot pistols that far on a regular basis, so that's not the case.
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:40.124]  I think that they wanted to show the world something ugly and something nasty and something evil, so they went for a headshot.
[00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:53.785]  And that's, you know, thankfully they did, and thankfully they suck, but here we are now, unified, fighting this war that we've been fighting for quite some time, and hopefully it's a wake-up call for a lot of people.
[00:22:55.891 --> 00:22:58.333]  Also, even if they were good shots, he obviously had backups.
[00:22:58.413 --> 00:22:59.794]  You're shooting Donald Trump.
[00:23:00.275 --> 00:23:04.358]  I mean, you know, yeah, we've shot mountain goats together and you name it, hunting all over the place.
[00:23:04.978 --> 00:23:06.359]  Back when you used to be here for years.
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:10.002]  And, you know, when you're relaxed shooting a mountain goat at 800 yards, it's easy.
[00:23:10.422 --> 00:23:12.564]  And obviously we shot right at the chest, you know, right at the side.
[00:23:13.024 --> 00:23:13.725]  You don't go for the head.
[00:23:14.851 --> 00:23:15.151]  Of course.
[00:23:14.971 --> 00:23:19.971]   you go with a kill shot, but imagine even you in a lot of combat, a lot of rewards,
[00:23:19.971 --> 00:23:23.170]  Quentin, in heavy combat in Iraq, you name it.
[00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:24.809]  Would you be a little nervous about to shoot Trump?
[00:23:24.809 --> 00:23:27.371]   I know you wouldn't want to, but would you be a little shaky when you're about to kill
[00:23:27.371 --> 00:23:28.371]  Trump?
[00:23:28.371 --> 00:23:29.371]  Of course.
[00:23:29.371 --> 00:23:38.211]   I mean, anyone that has enough mental instability to lay on a roof and take a shot at the greatest
[00:23:38.211 --> 00:23:39.690]  president in the history of our country.
[00:23:40.153 --> 00:23:41.013]  He's going to have nerves.
[00:23:41.193 --> 00:23:44.414]  The only way that you wouldn't is if he's heavily doped up.
[00:23:45.094 --> 00:23:55.597]  So if he's on some type of mind controlling drugs, if he's under some type of, you know, heavy antipsychotics or anisotropic, something like that, then maybe he doesn't.
[00:23:56.097 --> 00:23:57.237]  But I just don't see it.
[00:23:57.537 --> 00:23:58.777]  It doesn't make sense to me.
[00:23:59.338 --> 00:24:00.838]  The whole narrative is messed up.
[00:24:02.529 --> 00:24:05.792]  You know, when you dig into it and you're like, okay, why did they allow him to do this?
[00:24:05.912 --> 00:24:07.013]  Why did they allow him to do that?
[00:24:07.213 --> 00:24:11.856]  Why did they allow him to come up and probe the metal detectors?
[00:24:11.876 --> 00:24:13.598]  And why did they not fix anything about it?
[00:24:13.818 --> 00:24:15.519]  Why did no one make contact with him?
[00:24:15.659 --> 00:24:16.920]  How'd he fly a drone over?
[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:18.462]  How'd he wander around under the building?
[00:24:18.742 --> 00:24:20.023]  How was he found with a range finder?
[00:24:20.303 --> 00:24:21.284]  How'd he sneak a gun in there?
[00:24:22.785 --> 00:24:23.385]  All those things.
[00:24:23.445 --> 00:24:28.049]  And then they said that at one point, one of the local police officers walked up the ladder and saw him.
[00:24:28.489 --> 00:24:31.712]  He pointed a gun at him and they disengaged.
[00:24:32.642 --> 00:24:37.507]  But even when I met with Trump at the RNC and other events, they go, hey Alex, we love you, we gotta do this.
[00:24:37.928 --> 00:24:42.172]  They check my cell phone because it could be one of those guns, and they pat you down.
[00:24:42.192 --> 00:24:45.015]  I mean, the real Secret Service would not have allowed this.
[00:24:46.276 --> 00:24:46.877]  None whatsoever.
[00:24:47.958 --> 00:24:49.560]  Not unless they wanted it to happen.
[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:55.446]  And let's go back to some of the audio that we were talking about earlier as far as the different gunshots and things like that.
[00:24:56.218 --> 00:25:05.580]  When you listen to them, it's very clear that one of them has no echo, one of it has basically a standard report to it.
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:13.062]  But the previous gunshots before that sound muffled or echoed, almost like they're coming from the building below the shooter.
[00:25:14.082 --> 00:25:26.686]   So if you go back and you listen to that audio and you hear two or three shots and they sound a certain way, and then you hear two shots that hear completely different, and then back to something different, The problem is they think we're all stupid.
[00:25:27.086 --> 00:25:31.210]  And they think that what they've done in the past, they're going to do again and they're just going to keep pulling this over us.
[00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:39.478]  And I thought the hysteria of Trump being dead and the truck bombs that are going to detonate on a black church or whatever would have changed the subject, but they fucked up.
[00:25:40.802 --> 00:25:41.762]  Totally, totally.
[00:25:41.922 --> 00:25:47.745]  And then when we start talking about this kid and how did they instantly say he's operating alone.
[00:25:47.825 --> 00:25:52.207]  Well, how do you know he's operating alone if you're not in his cell phone, if you was never on the radar?
[00:25:52.227 --> 00:25:54.607]  And now he's got offshore secret accounts.
[00:25:54.928 --> 00:25:56.288]  And that's what I got from my sources.
[00:25:56.308 --> 00:26:00.810]  They said, no, this guy was heavily funded, flew a drone over, wasn't operative.
[00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:03.051]  Now we know he had high tech military explosives.
[00:26:03.091 --> 00:26:03.831]  That's about to come out.
[00:26:04.411 --> 00:26:05.352]  Quentin, what do you think's happening?
[00:26:05.392 --> 00:26:08.096]   And the other thing is, And I think it's a huge coverup.
[00:26:08.176 --> 00:26:13.118]  And I think that it was going to create a environment that made people scared to vote.
[00:26:13.278 --> 00:26:29.366]  It was going to do something that basically created a mail-in ballot, because in typical fashion, what used to happen early Iraq, Afghanistan, there's an attack on the people, and then there's an attack on the first responders.
[00:26:29.446 --> 00:26:32.027]  And that's what was going to happen with those explosives that were in the vehicle.
[00:26:32.668 --> 00:26:35.349]  He was going to assassinate Donald Trump.
[00:26:36.169 --> 00:26:44.911]  And then when people try to respond, whether that's first responders, the fire trucks, the paramedics, the other police officers, all that, they're going to have to drive past that vehicle to come in.
[00:26:45.691 --> 00:26:54.774]  He was either going to then detonate that vehicle to create enough of a diversion for him to get away, or he was going to do it to where no one could get in to help.
[00:26:55.334 --> 00:27:00.735]  And that creates an environment where a shooter can then continue to cause chaos.
[00:27:01.916 --> 00:27:13.034]   My question for everyone though is, What's a 20-year-old kid who's a nurse technician or something like that, whatever they made up he does for a living, how does he know how to create an IED?
[00:27:13.695 --> 00:27:18.898]  How does he know what explosives are what and how they work unless he's been on the internet somewhere?
[00:27:19.018 --> 00:27:20.218]  So what's the internet at home?
[00:27:20.439 --> 00:27:21.559]  What's the internet on his phone?
[00:27:21.999 --> 00:27:22.940]  What's his search history?
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.021]  Who's teaching him these things?
[00:27:25.421 --> 00:27:27.042]  Because this is not common knowledge stuff.
[00:27:27.263 --> 00:27:28.363]  Now I reached Heather Quentin.
[00:27:28.383 --> 00:27:29.444]  It's clear he's a cutout.
[00:27:30.629 --> 00:27:32.252]  He's a cutout as a cover story.
[00:27:32.712 --> 00:27:34.756]  That real shooter was in the window below him in the water tower.
[00:27:34.816 --> 00:27:37.901]  We'll be right back with Quentin Carter, good friend of mine, really smart guy.
[00:27:38.442 --> 00:27:41.347]  And then Doc Chambers, Colonel, Special Operations, coming on.
[00:27:41.727 --> 00:27:43.190]  Ivan Reikland, you name it, straight ahead.
[00:27:46.733 --> 00:27:48.254]  It's Sunday, July 21st, 2024.
[00:27:48.854 --> 00:27:52.177]  The old timers, 50 years ago, told us it was coming.
[00:27:52.657 --> 00:27:53.417]  We're now living in it.
[00:27:54.038 --> 00:27:54.978]  The New World Order.
[00:27:55.199 --> 00:27:56.579]  America fighting for its life.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:57.700]  But guess what?
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.101]  We're hard to kill!
[00:27:59.561 --> 00:28:00.522]  And we're winning!
[00:28:00.542 --> 00:28:04.885]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:28:07.246 --> 00:28:09.368]  I've never felt stronger.
[00:28:09.748 --> 00:28:11.169]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:28:11.409 --> 00:28:15.832]  Here they are trying to kill the man that stands with the people.
[00:28:17.465 --> 00:28:32.393]  I hope he's turning this way.
[00:28:32.252 --> 00:28:34.252]  I hope he's turning this way.
[00:28:34.252 --> 00:28:36.252]  Be careful.
[00:28:36.252 --> 00:28:46.252]  We got breaking news.
[00:28:46.252 --> 00:28:48.252]  Breaking news.
[00:28:48.252 --> 00:28:50.252]  Seems to be shots fired at the Trump rally.
[00:28:50.252 --> 00:29:00.252]  Are you okay?
[00:29:00.252 --> 00:29:02.252]  I love the left is claiming this is fake.
[00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:03.952]  You couldn't fake something like this.
[00:29:04.592 --> 00:29:06.974]  This is on live television everywhere.
[00:29:06.994 --> 00:29:07.715]  People died.
[00:29:10.976 --> 00:29:13.818]  And Trump rising up and pushing the Secret Service off to say 5-5-5.
[00:29:13.838 --> 00:29:14.659]  That's real.
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:16.921]  This is all real.
[00:29:16.981 --> 00:29:17.921]  Reality is so real.
[00:29:17.941 --> 00:29:18.522]  You can see it.
[00:29:19.763 --> 00:29:20.603]  You can smell it.
[00:29:21.864 --> 00:29:22.625]  You can taste it.
[00:29:24.546 --> 00:29:25.687]  There isn't just evil in the world, folks.
[00:29:25.707 --> 00:29:26.528]  There's not just globalists.
[00:29:26.548 --> 00:29:31.091]  There's you and I. When we activate, nothing on earth can stop us.
[00:29:31.632 --> 00:29:33.013]  They're now filled to full will.
[00:29:34.674 --> 00:29:37.836]  Humanity's power and our desire for the future.
[00:29:38.116 --> 00:29:40.116]  Fight, fight, fight.
[00:29:40.116 --> 00:29:42.116]  Fight, fight, fight.
[00:29:42.116 --> 00:29:44.116]  Fight, fight, fight.
[00:29:44.116 --> 00:29:46.116]  Fight, fight, fight.
[00:29:46.116 --> 00:29:48.116]  Fight, fight, fight.
[00:29:48.116 --> 00:29:50.116]  Fight, fight, fight.
[00:29:50.116 --> 00:29:54.116]   I don't even want to talk about what would have happened if they killed Trump.
[00:29:54.116 --> 00:29:58.116]  Because I'm not looking for war, but they'd have got it.
[00:29:58.261 --> 00:29:59.681]  Quentin, why don't you speak briefly?
[00:29:59.721 --> 00:30:04.042]  You're a smart guy, a former fellow that's been everywhere in the military.
[00:30:04.642 --> 00:30:06.282]  What would have happened if they killed Trump?
[00:30:07.643 --> 00:30:10.363]  And then let's get back at any other points you want to make before our next guests come on.
[00:30:10.403 --> 00:30:11.163]  I appreciate you joining us.
[00:30:12.264 --> 00:30:13.384]  Yeah, definitely.
[00:30:14.224 --> 00:30:16.164]  It's something super hard to speculate.
[00:30:16.684 --> 00:30:30.655]   The idea behind it, if they were to kill him, You feel like the American citizens have been pushed and pushed and pushed and bent as hard as they can, and I don't think it's long before someone breaks, you know?
[00:30:30.675 --> 00:30:34.057]  I think that the majority of Americans are trying their best.
[00:30:34.177 --> 00:30:38.420]  They go to work, they come home, they spend time with their families, they do the things they're supposed to do.
[00:30:40.217 --> 00:30:43.959]  And they're just hoping and praying that eventually something is going to go right.
[00:30:44.179 --> 00:30:46.100]  And nothing has gone right for quite some time.
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:55.224]  Whether we're talking about the COVID or the lockdowns or all of these things, all of the small businesses that people have lost, all these things that have gone wrong for so long.
[00:30:56.384 --> 00:30:57.625]  People are looking for that hope.
[00:30:57.785 --> 00:30:59.666]  We're looking for that chance.
[00:30:59.766 --> 00:31:06.208]  And that's Donald J. Trump, you know, like, as he says, we're going to do everything bigger, better, stronger, faster than we did before.
[00:31:06.709 --> 00:31:07.309]  And it'll be great.
[00:31:09.301 --> 00:31:09.841]  I like you.
[00:31:09.861 --> 00:31:13.625]  I'm not attempting to incite any violence at all.
[00:31:14.285 --> 00:31:15.066]  I don't want war.
[00:31:15.426 --> 00:31:19.470]  If you talk to men that have been to war, they're the last ones to call for war.
[00:31:20.091 --> 00:31:25.096]  The guys that have been on the front line and seen the world at its ugliest don't want to see it again.
[00:31:25.877 --> 00:31:31.041]   But they're also the ones that If it's called upon, they'll stand up.
[00:31:31.441 --> 00:31:32.902]  They've done it before, they'll do it again.
[00:31:32.922 --> 00:31:35.864]  So I hope that it never ever comes to that.
[00:31:36.184 --> 00:31:38.346]  So what is your message to the bureaucrats?
[00:31:38.846 --> 00:31:45.550]  Quentin, what is your message to bureaucrats and the globalists and these people that think they can carry this out and not ever face retribution?
[00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:48.612]  I want them to know that they need to back off right now.
[00:31:48.632 --> 00:31:52.574]  And I say that for their own future and for all our futures.
[00:31:52.614 --> 00:31:53.455]  They should give up now.
[00:31:54.938 --> 00:31:55.938]  They should give up.
[00:31:55.998 --> 00:31:57.799]  There's repercussions for everyone's action.
[00:31:58.459 --> 00:32:05.961]  And hopefully we can push through this by using ballots and doing it the right way.
[00:32:06.601 --> 00:32:12.642]  If you remember, I guess probably five or six years ago, we were talking about reelecting Donald Trump long before there was any of this.
[00:32:13.222 --> 00:32:17.283]  And I told you, hey, Alex, we need to do this shirt, man, by bullets or ballots.
[00:32:17.423 --> 00:32:18.083]  It doesn't matter.
[00:32:18.944 --> 00:32:21.484]  And you were very smart in your saying to me.
[00:32:21.504 --> 00:32:24.225]  You said, hey, man, like, that's a great saying.
[00:32:25.214 --> 00:33:04.139]   But I don't need to be the person pushing violence and it made a ton of sense you know and coming from you and the amount of voice and vocal like range that you have it made a ton of sense to me and it still resonates today so by no means are any of us calling for violence but I also think that there will come a time that people feel there is nothing else they can do if they continue to do this If they continue to push, if they continue to steal, if they continue to lock people down and basically just destroy their lives against their will, there will come a time where people push back.
[00:33:04.499 --> 00:33:05.480]  There's no doubt about that.
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:10.084]  I totally agree.
[00:33:10.244 --> 00:33:10.884]  I totally agree.
[00:33:10.904 --> 00:33:20.452]  So shifting gears back to the shooter wandering around beneath the building for an hour, climbing up on top of it, 26 minutes on top, 10 seconds is an eternity.
[00:33:21.363 --> 00:33:25.807]  And no one putting people on top of water tower buildings right by the president.
[00:33:25.847 --> 00:33:26.888]  I mean, that is default.
[00:33:27.288 --> 00:33:28.389]  Here he is wandering around.
[00:33:28.409 --> 00:33:30.491]  I mean, this was their patsy.
[00:33:30.892 --> 00:33:32.653]  And by the grace of God, the bullets didn't hit Trump.
[00:33:33.934 --> 00:33:34.895]  Speak to that in closing.
[00:33:34.975 --> 00:33:36.537]  If you're in the deep state, what are you thinking?
[00:33:38.679 --> 00:33:40.080]  It's a failure on every level.
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:47.707]  So being a failure on so many levels and so blatantly obvious, it's hard to believe that it wasn't purposeful.
[00:33:48.354 --> 00:33:58.099]  This young man walks around, probes the metal detectors, gets caught with different equipment, finds a ladder, puts the ladder against the building, and climbs on the roof.
[00:33:58.119 --> 00:33:59.759]  And like you said, he looks like a zombie.
[00:33:59.799 --> 00:34:01.060]  This guy sticks out like a sore thumb.
[00:34:02.031 --> 00:34:02.931]  He's just walking around.
[00:34:02.971 --> 00:34:07.513]  He does not look like the standard person that you see walking around.
[00:34:07.593 --> 00:34:11.575]  There's no level of excitement, as you see in every single one of these rallies.
[00:34:11.595 --> 00:34:13.156]  Like, it's a huge party.
[00:34:13.436 --> 00:34:19.478]  Everyone there is super happy and super thankful and proud Americans, and you see them just having a great time.
[00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:21.499]  And he didn't fit any of that bill.
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:29.240]   So, the idea that it's not Just an oversight isn't realistic to me.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.901]  An oversight is a small thing.
[00:34:31.281 --> 00:34:33.962]  I forgot to take the trash out or I forgot to do something like that.
[00:34:34.442 --> 00:34:40.164]  You didn't forget to cover the person who is running against your puppet.
[00:34:40.784 --> 00:34:45.766]  Like this is a man who's standing up for free will and America and America that we all love.
[00:34:46.267 --> 00:34:49.848]  And they purposely turned a blind eye to allow a lot of these crazy things to happen.
[00:34:51.068 --> 00:34:54.930]  Biden immediately called for gun control when he was talking to the NAACP.
[00:34:56.218 --> 00:34:57.539]  And I remember I was watching it.
[00:34:57.599 --> 00:35:00.660]  I really can't stand to hear him talk very much, but I listened to him occasionally.
[00:35:01.541 --> 00:35:02.881]  And he said, it's time to outlaw them.
[00:35:03.682 --> 00:35:04.342]  I did it before.
[00:35:04.362 --> 00:35:04.902]  I'll do it again.
[00:35:05.923 --> 00:35:08.884]  So a lot of this has to do with, is this a gun control movement?
[00:35:08.984 --> 00:35:24.112]  So were they able to assassinate Donald Trump and then immediately turn around and throw some type of big weapons ban on everyone so that if people did get mad, if people did get angry, if there was some type of civil unrest, would they be disarmed?
[00:35:24.669 --> 00:35:26.500]  That's my huge thought process right there.
[00:35:27.796 --> 00:35:31.759]  Well, the good news is, Quentin, is that I called you as your personal friend.
[00:35:31.779 --> 00:35:35.763]  I know about your great service and all your decorations, your great work you want to talk about.
[00:35:36.143 --> 00:35:39.946]  But I know you personally, I called you after I already talked to seven or eight people.
[00:35:40.127 --> 00:35:44.891]  I talked to six or seven, eight more after you, and they all said the same thing.
[00:35:44.911 --> 00:35:47.733]  They're going to be coming on the show here in succession.
[00:35:47.773 --> 00:35:50.195]  The good news is we're not gaslit anymore.
[00:35:50.255 --> 00:35:51.376]  We know we just got hit.
[00:35:52.077 --> 00:36:00.053]   We know they just tried to kill Trump and folks that I Briefed and they briefed me just hours, six, seven hours ago.
[00:36:00.573 --> 00:36:02.174]  They met with Trump Wednesday and Thursday.
[00:36:02.214 --> 00:36:02.794]  He gets it.
[00:36:03.294 --> 00:36:03.915]  He knows it.
[00:36:04.395 --> 00:36:05.195]  He understands it.
[00:36:06.096 --> 00:36:13.619]  And, uh, so they got a big problem on their hands and they're, they're putting in, as you know, the orange team and everybody else right now.
[00:36:13.639 --> 00:36:15.340]  And of course they can't do the orange team.
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:21.123]  It's current, but the orange team, that's much deeper bench, former Delta force, everybody else is flooding in for the zone.
[00:36:21.603 --> 00:36:22.764]  The globalists have got a big problem.
[00:36:24.713 --> 00:36:25.373]  They definitely do.
[00:36:26.374 --> 00:36:28.515]  Their biggest problem is Donald Trump.
[00:36:28.835 --> 00:36:34.217]  Their second biggest problem is the United States of America and the patriots who strive for a better life.
[00:36:34.817 --> 00:36:37.298]  They've pushed and pushed and pushed and they've awakened a giant.
[00:36:37.979 --> 00:36:38.699]  And here we are.
[00:36:38.959 --> 00:36:42.420]  And here we stand and we're ready to do whatever it takes to make America great again.
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:47.322]  I just want to say thank you again for the time and the opportunity to come on and speak to you.
[00:36:48.183 --> 00:36:50.004]  As always, I've always appreciated it.
[00:36:50.024 --> 00:36:50.864]  I've always enjoyed it.
[00:36:51.611 --> 00:36:53.953]  And, you know, talk to all your friends.
[00:36:54.013 --> 00:36:56.095]  Convince them that they need to register to vote.
[00:36:56.135 --> 00:36:57.015]  They need to go and vote.
[00:36:57.356 --> 00:36:58.877]  Every single vote is important.
[00:36:59.618 --> 00:37:01.259]  And it's time to take our country back.
[00:37:02.008 --> 00:37:07.831]  Well, I hate to write myself into this, but I've had to make peace with death over this, and I will not commit suicide.
[00:37:07.871 --> 00:37:09.832]  I will not kill my family in a murder-suicide.
[00:37:10.352 --> 00:37:12.253]  That's how they do it, and say you were a killer.
[00:37:12.273 --> 00:37:13.073]  I would never do that.
[00:37:13.213 --> 00:37:13.774]  That's a lie.
[00:37:14.294 --> 00:37:27.397]   When I talk to you and I talk to people at the highest levels of the Pentagon who are patriots and to Delta Force people today, they said, You're right, Jones, they're going to get you next, because they see me as the populist guy.
[00:37:27.417 --> 00:37:28.337]  I don't want to be that guy.
[00:37:28.377 --> 00:37:29.278]  I want to just beat these people.
[00:37:29.558 --> 00:37:33.600]  I'm not trying to run around here on the front line in a general outfit, but you said that same thing.
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:40.443]  People need to understand, they need to get through Trump to get to us, but you specifically warned me, and you're right, and everybody else warned me.
[00:37:40.483 --> 00:37:41.863]  They said, Jones, you're the next target.
[00:37:42.284 --> 00:37:48.006]  Not because of me, but this audience that they fear that this show is a focal point for, because they fear the people.
[00:37:48.046 --> 00:37:49.287]  Can you briefly speak to that?
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.362]  First and foremost, I have no intention of killing myself ever.
[00:37:53.782 --> 00:37:54.683]  Never have, never will.
[00:37:54.943 --> 00:37:55.803]  That is not a case.
[00:37:55.863 --> 00:37:58.465]  So if I end up gone, you can be sure they did it.
[00:37:58.965 --> 00:38:22.227]   But yeah, we've talked about it plenty of times and I've warned you and told you that there are active things going on and your ability to mobilize people Your ability to speak to people on a level that real people understand, not a politic version, not a, um, you know, snake oil salesman, but as a real person, like, Hey, this is wrong.
[00:38:22.527 --> 00:38:23.528]  They're coming for us.
[00:38:23.948 --> 00:38:26.270]  He's in the way they tried to take him out.
[00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:26.750]  You're next.
[00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:32.354]  So make no doubt that you need to be cognizant of what's going on.
[00:38:32.634 --> 00:38:34.215]  You need to surround yourself with winners.
[00:38:34.575 --> 00:38:37.957]  You need to take care of yourself the way that we did before, when I was there with you and.
[00:38:40.296 --> 00:38:48.198]  Just be very cognizant in your day-to-day stuff, because at the end of the day, they're going to do whatever they can to get rid of as many of us as possible.
[00:38:49.438 --> 00:38:53.019]  And normally the nail that stands the tallest gets hit the hardest.
[00:38:53.659 --> 00:39:00.801]  So as you're here every day telling the world how you feel and the different things that you see and hear, they're going to come after you, bud.
[00:39:01.221 --> 00:39:01.801]  I promise you.
[00:39:02.701 --> 00:39:18.728]   Well, Quentin, it's a 10-hour story, but six weeks ago without a court order, They later admitted in court that the Justice Department that's involved in bankruptcies ordered us shut down and came here and tried to order the private security firm to close us.
[00:39:18.788 --> 00:39:23.151]  They said no, but then they flipped out and admitted it all and said, well, he's bad.
[00:39:23.171 --> 00:39:24.052]  He's got to be shut down.
[00:39:24.072 --> 00:39:25.993]  I knew that wasn't about me, Quentin.
[00:39:26.073 --> 00:39:27.234]  That was what was about to come next.
[00:39:27.254 --> 00:39:29.115]  And I said, Laura Logan was here.
[00:39:29.135 --> 00:39:31.737]  I had to sleep up here for a week and literally stopped them taking us over.
[00:39:32.738 --> 00:39:34.219]  I told her a reason I mentioned her.
[00:39:34.259 --> 00:39:34.999]  That's a marker.
[00:39:35.059 --> 00:39:35.800]  People can watch that.
[00:39:37.085 --> 00:39:37.966]  I said it's not about me.
[00:39:38.366 --> 00:39:39.187]  They're about to kill Trump.
[00:39:39.207 --> 00:39:40.748]  It's so obvious, folks.
[00:39:41.108 --> 00:39:42.809]  They're going for broke.
[00:39:42.869 --> 00:39:43.530]  This is it.
[00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:47.452]  And listen, I'm not scared to die, but I'm scared of losing.
[00:39:48.113 --> 00:39:49.954]  And I'm scared of our children being slaves to this thing.
[00:39:50.554 --> 00:39:55.658]  And I just want people to realize that maximum effort is what is needed right now and total commitment.
[00:39:56.038 --> 00:39:56.939]  One minute closing comment.
[00:39:58.988 --> 00:40:00.009]  And that's the big thing.
[00:40:00.029 --> 00:40:01.250]  So it is maximum effort.
[00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:02.650]  It is everything in the world.
[00:40:03.151 --> 00:40:06.713]  If you're ever going to give anything to anyone right now, now is the time to do it.
[00:40:07.013 --> 00:40:07.954]  You need to push hard.
[00:40:08.254 --> 00:40:09.535]  You need to strive for excellence.
[00:40:09.695 --> 00:40:10.375]  All of these things.
[00:40:11.136 --> 00:40:11.876]  Be cognizant.
[00:40:11.976 --> 00:40:13.297]  Pay attention to what's going on.
[00:40:13.918 --> 00:40:15.118]  Try your absolute best.
[00:40:15.299 --> 00:40:18.040]  Understand that they are coming for each and every one of us.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:19.641]  They're just coming for us in different levels.
[00:40:21.403 --> 00:40:22.303]  God bless America.
[00:40:22.403 --> 00:40:23.164]  God bless you.
[00:40:23.344 --> 00:40:24.384]  God bless Donald Trump.
[00:40:25.105 --> 00:40:26.566]  And let's fight till this is over.
[00:40:27.372 --> 00:40:28.013]  God bless you, Quentin.
[00:40:28.033 --> 00:40:37.220]  All right, we're going to get Doc Chambers and Ivan Reikland on, both Green Berets, when I'm a colonel, and special operations, to talk about Defense Intelligence Agency and what's going to happen.
[00:40:37.841 --> 00:40:42.265]  But the Pentagon itself is for Trump, but at the top, they're bad guys.
[00:40:42.865 --> 00:40:47.529]  But from the generals down, the generals are bad, but the low are good people.
[00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:50.071]  And they're all listening right now, folks.
[00:40:50.632 --> 00:40:51.132]  This is it.
[00:40:51.673 --> 00:40:53.634]  I don't risk my life on a failed issue.
[00:40:54.562 --> 00:40:59.085]  I don't do this because I think we're going to lose and I just want to risk my life for fun.
[00:40:59.745 --> 00:41:04.287]  I'm doing this because I believe in you and I know we can win this thing and we're so close.
[00:41:05.108 --> 00:41:07.929]  But you've got to admit what you're really up against.
[00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:14.253]  You've got to admit where you are and the situation you're facing or you don't have a hope.
[00:41:14.813 --> 00:41:15.714]  You've got to call on God.
[00:41:16.874 --> 00:41:18.295]  And the minute you do that, you're going to win.
[00:41:21.058 --> 00:41:23.500]  Cannot think of a better way to go out than having them kill me.
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:24.241]  I don't want that.
[00:41:24.281 --> 00:41:24.881]  I love life.
[00:41:24.941 --> 00:41:32.267]  My God, I love steaks and enchiladas and sunrises and sunsets and hunting and my family and hugging my daughters and my son.
[00:41:32.287 --> 00:41:33.768]  But I'm ready to die.
[00:41:34.249 --> 00:41:35.349]  But I don't want to die.
[00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:37.892]  I want to make them get off our back.
[00:41:38.012 --> 00:41:39.413]  I want them to leave us alone.
[00:41:40.013 --> 00:41:53.983]  I want to defeat these degenerate lawyers and globalists and the Rothschilds and the Rockefeller Combine and the Carney Endowment and the CIA director that wants to castrate our sons and kill our veterans and ship in fentanyl and destroy our dollar.
[00:41:54.183 --> 00:41:54.964]  They're assholes.
[00:41:55.544 --> 00:41:58.286]  They're jerks because they're scared of freedom.
[00:41:59.547 --> 00:42:02.549]  Because in a free society, they don't get to make the decisions.
[00:42:05.311 --> 00:42:07.833]  As a confident man, I feel confident in your freedom.
[00:42:08.598 --> 00:42:09.358]  You don't threaten me.
[00:42:10.239 --> 00:42:10.979]  I've got children.
[00:42:11.339 --> 00:42:11.739]  Four of them.
[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:14.601]  They're going to live with you in the future.
[00:42:16.201 --> 00:42:17.422]  I look back at my ancestors.
[00:42:19.523 --> 00:42:20.223]  Amazing people.
[00:42:21.724 --> 00:42:22.524]  I want to be like them.
[00:42:24.165 --> 00:42:26.386]  That's what I want to do, and I want to beat the New World Order.
[00:42:26.406 --> 00:42:30.507]  All right, for the next 30 minutes, I'm headed to Roger Stone with Hugh Gentile.
[00:42:32.008 --> 00:42:33.949]  He is Ivan Reikland.
[00:42:34.815 --> 00:42:40.279]  Green Beret, Defense Intelligence Agency, formerly lawyer, doing a great job reaching tens of millions a week now.
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:45.743]  Just dominating the deep state, exposing who they are, spotlighting them.
[00:42:45.763 --> 00:42:49.685]  I remember exposing Fiona Hill and McMaster, and they had 60-minute shows exposing me.
[00:42:49.705 --> 00:42:50.546]  It's not about that.
[00:42:50.926 --> 00:42:52.207]  That's how wimpy they are.
[00:42:52.808 --> 00:42:56.931]  Like, they thought having a 60-minute show, Alex is mean to us, he exposes us.
[00:42:57.898 --> 00:42:59.019]  That just spotlighted them.
[00:42:59.039 --> 00:43:01.240]  It's not how good I am, it's how weak they are.
[00:43:01.681 --> 00:43:03.682]  I'm not that good, but I'm way ahead of them.
[00:43:03.982 --> 00:43:05.423]  It's like that Helter Skelter song.
[00:43:05.884 --> 00:43:08.065]  I'm coming down fast, but I'm miles above you.
[00:43:09.086 --> 00:43:16.491]  And the fact that they're so scared that I would spotlight them and send memos to Trump and tell Trump, these are the operatives in your operation.
[00:43:16.531 --> 00:43:17.412]  Such a simple thing.
[00:43:17.432 --> 00:43:18.633]  All those other people were scared.
[00:43:18.693 --> 00:43:19.093]  They knew.
[00:43:20.034 --> 00:43:21.375]  All it takes is a little courage, folks.
[00:43:21.955 --> 00:43:27.842]   And courage is contagious, and Trump's Courage is so contagious.
[00:43:27.882 --> 00:43:33.277]  So Ivan Reikland, former Rainbow Ray, lawyer, ultra, marathoner.
[00:43:34.221 --> 00:43:41.003]  At Ivan Reikland, Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Pete Chambers, Doc Chambers, and all his great work around the world.
[00:43:41.483 --> 00:43:45.885]  I'm so honored to have both of you here at the edge of victory or the edge of defeat.
[00:43:46.245 --> 00:43:47.605]  What an incredible moment.
[00:43:47.625 --> 00:43:48.846]  We're alive together.
[00:43:49.186 --> 00:43:55.728]  And thank God Congress and senators are coming out from from from Johnson to Hawley, saying it's an inside job.
[00:43:56.148 --> 00:43:58.208]  You got to do that to put the enemy off balance.
[00:43:58.588 --> 00:43:59.789]  What is their next move?
[00:44:00.129 --> 00:44:03.150]  You guys just spoke to the big sheriff's conference.
[00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:04.630]  In North Texas.
[00:44:05.131 --> 00:44:06.311]  I mean, we are on the march.
[00:44:06.351 --> 00:44:07.732]  We'll get to that coming up next hour.
[00:44:08.112 --> 00:44:11.673]  But first off, the consensus is inside job help.
[00:44:12.754 --> 00:44:14.714]  Military explosives in his car and house.
[00:44:15.094 --> 00:44:16.475]  A drone protected.
[00:44:17.415 --> 00:44:18.756]  Acoustic show double shooters.
[00:44:20.232 --> 00:44:22.954]  Trump started to come out and say, yeah, it looks like an inside job.
[00:44:23.274 --> 00:44:25.836]  That is so important, in my perspective, to put them off balance.
[00:44:26.116 --> 00:44:27.777]  Let them know we know we're under attack.
[00:44:28.097 --> 00:44:30.138]  If we want to admit we're under attack, how do we beat them?
[00:44:30.478 --> 00:44:37.583]  So, Ivan or Doc, whoever wants to go first, but give us your boiled-down analysis of where we are, because this is 1776 on steroids.
[00:44:41.775 --> 00:44:42.455]  That's right, Alex.
[00:44:42.515 --> 00:44:47.437]  Last time I was down there with you, your show was about to shut down the next day.
[00:44:47.757 --> 00:44:49.497]  You were the Alamo of Texas.
[00:44:50.017 --> 00:44:52.698]  Right now, this is the Alamo of Texas.
[00:44:52.758 --> 00:45:00.161]  This is 254 constitutional sheriffs that we're trying to pull out of here that are going to go after the D-State once we get this list released.
[00:45:00.621 --> 00:45:05.042]  All right, so what do we think about the inside job that happened against President Trump?
[00:45:05.737 --> 00:45:07.238]  Yeah, we know that what that was.
[00:45:07.258 --> 00:45:13.981]  That was an epic fail, but it was so epic that it was obvious that it was planned and it was planned from the inside.
[00:45:14.021 --> 00:45:14.181]  Now.
[00:45:14.561 --> 00:45:17.143]  I don't have I don't have the receipts for any of that.
[00:45:17.183 --> 00:45:31.710]  But right now anybody that yet but anybody that that can see that that has eyes to see and we we personally both have done outer perimeter security for dignitaries to include for me to presidents including Trump in the past.
[00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:35.212]  So we know what right looks like that was that was a wedge.
[00:45:35.912 --> 00:45:54.692]  Of a cone of fire essentially that was left wide open with all the acoustic information that came out via Health Ranger Mike Adams to look at those different types of and you know I'm not a sniper but ballistically I understand that there were rounds that came out as far as a thousand meters.
[00:45:55.242 --> 00:45:55.382]  Right.
[00:45:55.442 --> 00:45:56.062]  And as short as 150.
[00:45:56.182 --> 00:46:01.084]  So you got a smaller caliber, larger caliber, a larger caliber.
[00:46:01.805 --> 00:46:03.925]  That's what some of the victims were hitting the stands.
[00:46:04.466 --> 00:46:07.747]  I have not done the forensics, so I can't give you the receipts.
[00:46:07.787 --> 00:46:10.188]  But yeah, it's an inside job, no doubt.
[00:46:10.548 --> 00:46:11.508]  Trump understands that.
[00:46:11.928 --> 00:46:16.170]  And the people that I talked to that are on the inside know that that's exactly right.
[00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:18.071]  And how incredible is that he lived?
[00:46:18.111 --> 00:46:20.532]  Where Sam was the person that died and the other two that got wounded.
[00:46:20.552 --> 00:46:23.573]  But how incredibly powerful, Doc Chambers.
[00:46:25.876 --> 00:46:33.262]  How scared is the Deep State right now that they shot at him from multiple muzzles and they failed?
[00:46:34.716 --> 00:46:36.277]  Right, well that's why they're doing this right now.
[00:46:36.297 --> 00:46:37.698]  That's why they're doing all these things.
[00:46:38.099 --> 00:46:42.422]  But they're making so many mistakes, because when people are on their heels, that's like us routing the enemy.
[00:46:42.462 --> 00:46:45.024]  When we route the enemy, they make mistakes.
[00:46:45.084 --> 00:46:46.986]  And they've made mistakes here, huge mistakes.
[00:46:47.426 --> 00:46:48.567]  And they're going to continue to do it.
[00:46:48.888 --> 00:46:52.430]  And that's why we're putting the pressure on by hitting these constitutional sheriffs.
[00:46:52.771 --> 00:46:54.612]  We've got 254 sheriffs here.
[00:46:54.972 --> 00:46:57.635]  In the next two more days, we will be lining out.
[00:46:57.655 --> 00:47:00.457]  And then we will be closing the gap, if you will.
[00:47:00.857 --> 00:47:03.940]  And we'll talk about that next hour, but that's so key.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:10.844]  You're constitutionally doing what Soros is doing, trying to use the local governments as weapon systems.
[00:47:10.884 --> 00:47:13.885]  You're just trying to activate people that are left to counter that.
[00:47:13.926 --> 00:47:14.686]  They're so scared.
[00:47:14.706 --> 00:47:16.327]  That's why they're attacking Ivan.
[00:47:17.858 --> 00:47:18.178]  That's right.
[00:47:18.318 --> 00:47:19.099]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:22.222]  So, I mean, that was a miracle that President Trump survived that.
[00:47:22.242 --> 00:47:29.348]  Remember when, in February, we were talking about the worst-case scenario for the deep state is for them to conduct an assassination of Trump.
[00:47:29.748 --> 00:47:38.095]  I think even worse is a failed assassination attempt, and now he survives, has the power, and now we are in the game.
[00:47:38.115 --> 00:47:39.937]  I was about to say, we got the best of both worlds.
[00:47:39.957 --> 00:47:40.897]  We didn't want him to die.
[00:47:41.258 --> 00:47:42.359]  We said, don't try it, Puck.
[00:47:42.419 --> 00:47:43.099]  It'll backfire.
[00:47:43.439 --> 00:47:45.161]  They did try it, and it backfired.
[00:47:45.181 --> 00:47:46.022]  We just got most of us.
[00:47:50.186 --> 00:47:50.627]  Absolutely.
[00:47:50.647 --> 00:47:50.627]  100%.
[00:47:51.688 --> 00:48:00.859]  And going back to the ballistics, I mean, when you watch and listen to the actual gunfire, obviously you have three of similar shots being fired in succession.
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:07.720]   What I think, from my perspective, when they saw that they did not explode President Trump's
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:14.320]   head in the first three rounds, another shooter in rapid succession was like, "Oh my God,
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.320]  I need to do something."
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:21.800]   And so then you hear another five rounds being shot at such a rapid pace, you can't, I mean,
[00:48:22.810 --> 00:48:23.850]  We're going to find all that out.
[00:48:24.111 --> 00:48:32.155]  But it was too rapid for it to be a, you know, sustained line of fire that would be placed on a specific target.
[00:48:32.515 --> 00:48:43.460]  And so I think they were just like, oh crap, we need to lay off as many rounds as possible before I have an exfil strategy so that they could potentially, uh, I mean, they tried to execute Trump.
[00:48:43.601 --> 00:48:45.361]  So it was boom, boom, boom.
[00:48:45.421 --> 00:48:46.882]  And then boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:48:46.922 --> 00:48:52.356]   Maybe there was two people, maybe even, Shooting at that rapid rate.
[00:48:52.636 --> 00:48:59.343]  It was just too rapid to have accurate Fire being done in that short period of time from my perspective.
[00:48:59.584 --> 00:49:01.966]  Can you imagine the deep state right now with their thing?
[00:49:04.169 --> 00:49:12.446]   Yeah, we there They're trying to cover up the previous cover-up by, you know, they're going to try to throw Cheadle under the bus.
[00:49:13.366 --> 00:49:15.528]  At the end of the day, I got to remind people that forgot this.
[00:49:16.108 --> 00:49:21.011]  The House of Representatives have already impeached Ali Mayorkas twice.
[00:49:21.651 --> 00:49:29.976]  The Senate has refused to conduct their constitutional duty known as a Senate trial to convict Ali Mayorkas.
[00:49:30.576 --> 00:49:43.199]  Congressman Mark Green of the House Homeland Security Committee needs to immediately put together yet another article of impeachment for Ali Mayorkas and Cheadle's attempted assassination.
[00:49:43.339 --> 00:49:44.559]  And Ivan, I totally agree.
[00:49:44.579 --> 00:49:45.999]  I'll give you the floor in the next 30 minutes.
[00:49:46.659 --> 00:49:48.480]  But they're going to try to kill Trump again.
[00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:52.741]  Talking about eight days in, it blew up in their face.
[00:49:53.201 --> 00:49:54.241]  They're totally desperate.
[00:49:54.281 --> 00:49:58.362]  If I was them, and I'm not them, and I'm just analyzing them, they're going to go all out.
[00:49:58.602 --> 00:49:59.362]  What is your view on that?
[00:50:01.232 --> 00:50:02.454]  Yeah, I think nothing's off the table.
[00:50:02.474 --> 00:50:14.989]  We talked about this before when I was on a couple times and and they're just trying to right now we are applying maximum pressure because we're getting a big a lot of big tech players are coming on board to support Elon and his push to support President Trump.
[00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:20.516]  I think Elon has disclosed to some of his close friends and in Silicon Valley that were leftists.
[00:50:20.916 --> 00:50:28.861]  That I'm sitting on all this trove of criminal evidence of what the conspiracy theorists known as Alex Jones are actually conspiracy oracles.
[00:50:29.302 --> 00:50:32.504]  And you might want to back off supporting the radical left.
[00:50:32.964 --> 00:50:35.426]  And so there's this transitioning happening.
[00:50:35.466 --> 00:50:36.386]  They don't know what to do.
[00:50:36.767 --> 00:50:41.890]  They have to remove the dementia patient and they have to play musical chairs.
[00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:49.652]  Right now they're being disrupted and I think we need to continue to escalate that disruption in the maximal legal, moral, ethical way possible.
[00:50:50.052 --> 00:50:51.913]  We're doing it here at the Sheriff's Association.
[00:50:52.213 --> 00:51:08.599]   But in addition to that, I recommend all Patriots volunteer to participate in the DNC Convention so that they can observe and monitor and report, whether it's as media or as volunteers, any shenanigans that take place so that they are on notice Yeah, we're not.
[00:51:08.619 --> 00:51:08.939]  You're right.
[00:51:08.979 --> 00:51:09.980]  That's got to scare him.
[00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:12.041]  So, Doc Chambers and I'm right.
[00:51:12.061 --> 00:51:12.722]  We're about to go to break.
[00:51:12.742 --> 00:51:13.963]  Come back with you guys for another 20 minutes.
[00:51:13.983 --> 00:51:14.763]  We had a Roger Stone.
[00:51:14.783 --> 00:51:16.625]  What are you going to cover when we come up?
[00:51:16.765 --> 00:51:17.586]  What is on your radar?
[00:51:17.606 --> 00:51:19.267]  I've been asking questions, but you're a smart guy.
[00:51:19.647 --> 00:51:20.528]  Colonel, what do you recommend?
[00:51:21.647 --> 00:51:22.127]  Right.
[00:51:22.147 --> 00:51:31.335]  So in the next several days and next few weeks, there will be a period of grace that will exist for people that hold this information that are whistleblowers.
[00:51:31.655 --> 00:51:38.000]  We're going to give a period of grace and then we're going to start exposing names of people that understood what was going on but did nothing about it.
[00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:39.781]  We have to do it that way.
[00:51:39.801 --> 00:51:41.681]  That's the only way because we're in a race.
[00:51:41.741 --> 00:51:43.562]  We're in a marathon and we just found out about it.
[00:51:43.642 --> 00:51:45.903]  It's a 26 mile mark at this point.
[00:51:45.963 --> 00:51:49.004]  So we've got to move weeks of amnesty remain.
[00:51:49.064 --> 00:51:52.125]  We've got to move the we've got to move the goalpost and that's it.
[00:51:52.145 --> 00:51:54.066]  You're saying there's an amnesty right now.
[00:51:56.327 --> 00:51:56.627]  Yes, sir.
[00:51:57.447 --> 00:51:57.927]  Join us.
[00:51:59.892 --> 00:52:01.393]  We'll hit it on the next section.
[00:52:01.693 --> 00:52:03.874]  We'll be right back in T-minus two minutes.
[00:52:04.014 --> 00:52:05.975]  Everybody watching, you're the Paul Reveres.
[00:52:06.015 --> 00:52:06.635]  You're the power.
[00:52:06.655 --> 00:52:07.115]  We're nothing.
[00:52:07.896 --> 00:52:10.557]  If you share the links right now, we reach 20 million extra people.
[00:52:10.957 --> 00:52:11.617]  Share the links now.

[00:52:15.859 --> 00:52:18.020]  Colonel Doc Chambers and Ivan Reiglin are our guests.
[00:52:18.061 --> 00:52:18.461]  Stay with us.
[00:52:22.543 --> 00:52:23.643]  Please pray for M4 Wars.
[00:52:23.944 --> 00:52:26.845]  Please pray for the crew, and I'm so thankful to the crew who did such a great job.
[00:52:26.865 --> 00:52:32.567]  I'm so thankful to Owen and to Chase and to all the rest of the crew and to Rob Dugar here with me right now.
[00:52:32.667 --> 00:52:38.129]  We are one family together, black, white, old, young, you name it, in the fight for liberty against the New World Order.
[00:52:38.349 --> 00:52:41.311]  Thank you so much for your past support, and I humbly ask for your support now.
[00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:46.309]   you go to Infowarsstore.com where the big Save Infowars sales going with X2 and X3 and
[00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:50.630]   DNA Force Plus, Nitric Boost, all these other incredible game-changing products.
[00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:56.911]   Also the great line, a dozen products under Infowars MD, private labeled from a top manufacturer
[00:52:56.911 --> 00:52:57.911]  in the country.
[00:52:57.911 --> 00:53:01.391]   They said, "Hey, we'll let you have our whole line and then we'll ship it for you.
[00:53:01.391 --> 00:53:02.391]  We'll do it all.
[00:53:02.391 --> 00:53:03.391]  It's all drop shipping.
[00:53:03.391 --> 00:53:04.391]  All our products are selling out.
[00:53:04.391 --> 00:53:05.870]  We're out of money."
[00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:11.329]   But because of Infowars MD, they have basically unlimited for us so that now when you buy
[00:53:11.329 --> 00:53:16.510]   Infowars MD, you're getting great, excellent, amazing products that are across the board
[00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:20.431]  for your supplement needs and they then keep us on the air.
[00:53:20.362 --> 00:53:21.944]  Infowars MD.
[00:53:22.304 --> 00:53:28.591]  All right, recently retired Green Beret Colonel Doc Chambers and former Defense Intelligence Agency Green Beret.
[00:53:28.611 --> 00:53:30.253]  I have a regular guest.
[00:53:30.593 --> 00:53:33.116]  Some stations don't carry this first five, but with us another 20 or so.
[00:53:33.636 --> 00:53:34.557]  That is Roger Stone.
[00:53:34.577 --> 00:53:35.699]  We got interrupted by the break.
[00:53:36.399 --> 00:53:39.723]  This moment of history, what the defense is going to do now, I don't think they're going to give up.
[00:53:40.484 --> 00:53:47.068]  Getting into what we saw with the shooting and Biden stepping down and all of this, which I predicted would happen today, two weeks ago.
[00:53:47.649 --> 00:53:48.709]  Where do you see this going?
[00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:49.790]  What can we do to stop it?
[00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:51.091]  And any points you want to make?
[00:53:54.457 --> 00:54:08.842]  Piggyback off of what Doc Chambers just said before the break is that I just published a Substack article detailing out if you are in the government, former or current, that has observed directly how the principles acted over the course of the last several years.
[00:54:09.142 --> 00:54:16.305]   I'm saying the principles on that deep state target list and you have evidence to support the It's not a hypothesis.
[00:54:16.605 --> 00:54:24.208]  The knowledge that they conducted treason, then you have, we're giving you a grace period until September 3rd to come out as a whistleblower.
[00:54:24.528 --> 00:54:27.889]  And in that article, it details exactly who you need to reach out to.
[00:54:28.249 --> 00:54:33.251]  If you're from within the Department of Justice, FBI, etc., you reach out to Jim Jordan.
[00:54:33.611 --> 00:54:39.834]  You then see see me as well if you want to indicate your good faith effort so that we don't scrutinize you maximally.
[00:54:40.374 --> 00:54:53.509]  If you're from the FISA court process, the NSA, the FISA court staff, similarly, if you're involved in illegal or observed illegal FISA warrants and processes, you need to also come out to the Judiciary Committee.
[00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:55.891]  And by the way, this isn't talk.
[00:54:55.951 --> 00:54:57.153]  You're giving people amnesty.
[00:54:57.193 --> 00:54:58.374]  This is going down.
[00:54:58.935 --> 00:54:59.715]  This is not a joke.
[00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:01.771]  Correct.
[00:55:02.251 --> 00:55:03.972]  So here's what's going to happen.
[00:55:04.032 --> 00:55:07.655]  If you're from the White House previous, then you go to Jim Comer.
[00:55:07.995 --> 00:55:13.320]  If you observe and were part of that COVID con, then you also reach out to Congressman Jim Comer.
[00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:17.983]  I recommend not reaching out to Brad Wenstrup, who chairs the COVID Select Committee.
[00:55:18.303 --> 00:55:22.767]  We cannot trust him based on his inaction over the last year and a half in Congress.
[00:55:23.147 --> 00:55:36.242]  Similarly, if you're a part of observing the DOD illegal COVID mandate, you don't go to the House Armed Services Committee Chairman, Mike Rogers, because he has indicated that he is in on it based on his inactions.
[00:55:36.682 --> 00:55:38.625]  You go over to somebody like a Matt Gaetz.
[00:55:39.265 --> 00:55:46.047]  Or a congressman, Jim Banks, who chairs the subcommittee on House Armed Services known as Personnel and Readiness.
[00:55:46.527 --> 00:56:01.031]  You cc me at info at rakeland.com and then you make a public post on X or something, I would say on X, and say, I have provided whistleblower evidence to, and then you tag the member of Congress and the appropriate committee.
[00:56:01.591 --> 00:56:15.295]  And if you don't do that, folks, we're going to treat you the same way we are the principals that were involved in the 39 that illegally unmasked General Flynn, the 51 that spies who lied, and your staffs, right?
[00:56:15.656 --> 00:56:22.418]  The whistleblower campaign with the impeachment hoax one, impeachment hoax two, the COVID con, all of it.
[00:56:22.538 --> 00:56:24.278]  They're all categorized on my computer.
[00:56:24.298 --> 00:56:26.359]  And by the way, the corporate media has been attacking everyone.
[00:56:26.379 --> 00:56:27.479]  They're scared of this plan.
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:28.840]  Separately, though.
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:32.551]  What do you think the deep state pulls now that everything's turned against them?
[00:56:33.013 --> 00:56:33.795]  A false flag?
[00:56:34.177 --> 00:56:34.658]  A cyber attack?
[00:56:34.678 --> 00:56:35.140]  What do you think?
[00:56:36.570 --> 00:56:37.610]  I mean, we've already seen it, right?
[00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:38.390]  Cyber attack.
[00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:42.591]  Yeah, we had a cyber attack on steroids on the next go-around, Alex.
[00:56:42.671 --> 00:56:44.352]  Unfortunately, that's what I'm hearing.
[00:56:44.492 --> 00:56:48.273]  I just think that Elon Musk has already thought through a couple chess pieces ahead.
[00:56:48.333 --> 00:56:54.134]  The reason why he pulled his assets out of California and is now all of his holdings are in Texas.
[00:56:54.254 --> 00:56:55.594]  It's absolutely brilliant.
[00:56:56.114 --> 00:57:00.915]  He doesn't have the foot on proverbial neck by having his corporations in California.
[00:57:01.355 --> 00:57:04.376]  He's under the protection of Abbott.
[00:57:04.836 --> 00:57:05.937]  Of Ken Paxton.
[00:57:06.338 --> 00:57:24.956]  I think that moving forward, what's going to happen is I would expect to see Attorney General Ken Paxton go ahead and subpoena Elon Musk for the records that he's investigating about, meaning the COVID con, the big pharma stuff, and in there... No, no, no, that's the key to bring him down, and I think you're right.
[00:57:24.976 --> 00:57:26.197]  He went all in on Trump this week.
[00:57:26.217 --> 00:57:27.399]  I think that's coming next.
[00:57:30.214 --> 00:57:37.996]  It has to, and then I would like to see Jim Comer, Jim Jordan, Barry Laudermill, to go ahead and also subpoena from the congressional perspective, Twitter 1.0.
[00:57:38.156 --> 00:57:39.376]  Okay, okay.
[00:57:39.496 --> 00:57:41.596]  We're doing a bunch of stays in 60 seconds.
[00:57:41.616 --> 00:57:41.996]  Stay there.
[00:57:42.016 --> 00:57:43.517]  I want to talk big picture, though.
[00:57:43.537 --> 00:57:44.637]  The deep state tried to kill Trump.
[00:57:44.677 --> 00:57:45.097]  They failed.
[00:57:45.737 --> 00:57:46.597]  What are they going to do next?
[00:57:46.637 --> 00:57:47.357]  How do we stop them?
[00:57:47.798 --> 00:57:52.819]  We're right back with Doc Chambers, Colonel Doc Chambers, and Ivan Reiklin and Alex Jones.
[00:57:52.839 --> 00:57:53.239]  Stay with us.
[00:57:53.059 --> 00:57:56.059]  This is the Rodgers Stone in about 20 minutes.
[00:57:56.059 --> 00:58:02.059]  This is not a video game.
[00:58:02.387 --> 00:58:03.407]  This is not a movie.
[00:58:04.087 --> 00:58:05.288]  This is not Netflix.
[00:58:05.308 --> 00:58:06.248]  This is not entertainment.
[00:58:06.929 --> 00:58:12.351]  This is the deep state trying to kill our president that's incredibly popular and wants to stop World War III.
[00:58:13.311 --> 00:58:18.871]   So I'm asking Doc Chambers, Lieutenant Colonel for just recently retired Army Special Operations
[00:58:18.871 --> 00:58:23.311]   and Ivan Reiklin, Green Beret, lawyer, great patriot, doing an incredible job reaching
[00:58:23.311 --> 00:58:24.951]  tens of millions a week, exposing the globalists.
[00:58:24.951 --> 00:58:30.190]   We can talk about getting the sheriffs mobilized and governors and legislatures and Black Rocks
[00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:33.791]   panicking and admitting everybody's pulling their funding and the new order's going down
[00:58:33.791 --> 00:58:37.271]  and they're giving up on their DEI.
[00:58:37.271 --> 00:58:40.451]  Yes, we're winning.
[00:58:40.451 --> 00:58:46.030]   But Freedom of Information Act requests are great and going to speak at a city council
[00:58:46.236 --> 00:58:46.896]  Everybody should do that.
[00:58:46.976 --> 00:58:49.277]  But big picture, they're desperate.
[00:58:49.297 --> 00:58:50.558]  They're going to try to get Trump again.
[00:58:50.598 --> 00:58:59.661]  It's like the quote, the Godfather, the first episode where they shoot the Godfather, and later to be the Don, Michael Corleone says, they got to kill Pop.
[00:58:59.681 --> 00:59:00.242]  That's the key.
[00:59:01.262 --> 00:59:02.683]  And so they're going to try again.
[00:59:02.783 --> 00:59:03.943]  What are we doing about that?
[00:59:04.763 --> 00:59:07.765]  And what other tricks, Doc Chambers, do you think the enemy has up their sleeve?
[00:59:09.685 --> 00:59:09.905]  Right.
[00:59:09.945 --> 00:59:10.206]  Yeah.
[00:59:12.231 --> 00:59:15.716]  They have probably already had people in play that have been stopped.
[00:59:15.836 --> 00:59:17.198]  I'm going to say that right now.
[00:59:18.019 --> 00:59:18.781]  That have been stopped.
[00:59:19.161 --> 00:59:23.828]  Notice that the team, the protective service detail that was around President Trump.
[00:59:24.389 --> 00:59:25.810]  They fired everybody but two.
[00:59:26.291 --> 00:59:28.293]  They brought in people that were taller than President.
[00:59:28.353 --> 00:59:28.993]  That's key.
[00:59:29.114 --> 00:59:30.495]  That wasn't done that first round.
[00:59:30.655 --> 00:59:31.516]  One of the epic fails.
[00:59:32.337 --> 00:59:33.197]  Probably on purpose.
[00:59:33.778 --> 00:59:37.401]  And so that team has probably already stopped something already.
[00:59:38.082 --> 00:59:42.606]  Because we're not, I believe... Yeah, what's that midget woman that can't holster her gun?
[00:59:42.646 --> 00:59:43.127]  What is that?
[00:59:44.641 --> 00:59:46.183]  That's a circus midget.
[00:59:46.283 --> 00:59:47.644]  I don't know.
[00:59:48.105 --> 00:59:49.606]  I have no idea what she was doing there.
[00:59:49.686 --> 00:59:51.047]  Or a man that was that tall.
[00:59:51.087 --> 00:59:54.290]  You don't put somebody up against a principal that is 6'3".
[00:59:54.431 --> 00:59:55.992]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:59:56.052 --> 00:59:57.053]  I mean, that's just... And it's fun.
[00:59:57.093 --> 00:59:58.995]  That's because a bigger person can shield them.
[01:00:00.326 --> 01:00:01.867]  Absolutely, that's the whole purpose of that.
[01:00:02.127 --> 01:00:06.308]  Now you've got an NFL front line, you know, linemen that are around him.
[01:00:06.808 --> 01:00:15.291]  You want a bullet magnet sized person if you're protecting the president, but if you're going in to conduct a raid, you probably want a smaller individual so that you're not a bullet magnet.
[01:00:16.251 --> 01:00:19.092]  And that's somebody that's physically capable in both instances.
[01:00:19.632 --> 01:00:20.772]  Obviously we didn't see that there.
[01:00:20.832 --> 01:00:26.094]  Now yeah, there's times for little people, times for big people, but Trump's front line people need to be tall to be able to shield him.
[01:00:27.521 --> 01:00:28.202]  That's right.
[01:00:28.302 --> 01:00:31.165]  On the inner perimeter security, that's a requirement.
[01:00:31.506 --> 01:00:44.441]  I've never seen anything like this before, and I've been around three different details that I've worked with in the past on ADVON for presidential... Well, Congressman Mills has done thousands of operations for dignitaries.
[01:00:44.481 --> 01:00:45.422]  He said it was a stand-down.
[01:00:46.002 --> 01:00:50.085]  And I guess we've got coming on tomorrow, they're all, they say it's a direct stand down, no doubt.
[01:00:50.405 --> 01:00:51.586]  Water towers not covered.
[01:00:51.646 --> 01:00:52.546]  Rooftop not covered.
[01:00:52.887 --> 01:00:53.987]  That was a default shutdown.
[01:00:54.007 --> 01:00:57.149]  Direct stand down is exactly what they did, like, on January 6th.
[01:00:57.450 --> 01:01:04.114]  I have somebody here that can give you details of the parallels between January 6th and the assassination attempt.
[01:01:04.174 --> 01:01:05.135]  It's Dave Summerall.
[01:01:05.555 --> 01:01:08.917]  Total subject matter expert, probably, hands down, bar none.
[01:01:08.977 --> 01:01:11.479]  No one understands and knows what's going on with January 6th.
[01:01:11.779 --> 01:01:13.040]  And he can bring in that perspective.
[01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:14.401]  Tell us who Dave Summerall is.
[01:01:17.879 --> 01:01:19.763]  He's been on Owen Troyer's show before.
[01:01:19.983 --> 01:01:22.408]  Yeah, I know his name, but just, okay, bring him in real quick.
[01:01:22.428 --> 01:01:23.170]  Give us a quick update.
[01:01:26.601 --> 01:01:27.402]  What's going on, Alex?
[01:01:27.442 --> 01:01:28.923]  David Summerall, StopHate.com.
[01:01:29.383 --> 01:01:32.786]  I just wanted to say the parallels are that it's the public that's involved.
[01:01:32.846 --> 01:01:37.749]  It's the same people like us, just regular folks that went and showed up with their phones.
[01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:43.233]  Listen, the FBI is doing the same kind of investigation on the assassination that they did on J6.
[01:01:43.734 --> 01:01:44.054]  Nothing.
[01:01:44.454 --> 01:02:02.882]   So it's really up to the people, up to people like Doc and Ivan and myself and others This Texas Constitutional Sheriff's Association meeting that we're trying to push the constitutional aspects of what a sheriff is supposed to do to protect its people from a tyrannical government, this is the exercise in that.
[01:02:03.282 --> 01:02:11.224]  And I think that the assassination attempt is another J6, basically, to show that they are stronger and tougher and meaner and badder than us.
[01:02:12.012 --> 01:02:12.533]  When they're not.
[01:02:12.653 --> 01:02:14.955]  And we're going to have to show them that it's the people.
[01:02:15.015 --> 01:02:16.216]  The power is the people's.
[01:02:16.276 --> 01:02:17.518]  It's not the government's anymore.
[01:02:17.578 --> 01:02:18.218]  I mean, I agree.
[01:02:18.639 --> 01:02:19.299]  And they missed.
[01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:20.401]  So what are they going to do now?
[01:02:20.961 --> 01:02:26.106]  Because just because we're kicking their ass, we should ask, OK, how's the enemy who won't give up?
[01:02:26.507 --> 01:02:27.468]  How are they going to counterstrike?
[01:02:27.488 --> 01:02:28.128]  That's what I'm asking.
[01:02:29.550 --> 01:02:29.730]  Right.
[01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:43.785]   So what we're doing here in Texas, I'll explain part of why the reason that I'm here at this Texas Constitutional Sheriff's Group, Texas for Constitutional Sheriffs, is that there are 254 sheriffs downstairs coming in and out all day long.
[01:02:44.423 --> 01:02:52.528]  We're meeting with them and we are basically ranking them where they are as far as constitutionality because it's we the people that are pushing them.
[01:02:52.828 --> 01:02:53.929]  They're going to follow us.
[01:02:54.429 --> 01:02:57.851]  Just like we had the convoy that came down to Quemado from Virginia.
[01:02:58.192 --> 01:03:03.955]  It was the law enforcement that came to us and we worked together in this way that it's supposed to be.
[01:03:04.335 --> 01:03:04.916]  We the people.
[01:03:05.436 --> 01:03:05.676]  Right?
[01:03:05.756 --> 01:03:06.877]  That's just how it's supposed to be.
[01:03:07.157 --> 01:03:08.497]  So that's what's happening right now.
[01:03:08.917 --> 01:03:09.758]  And they understand it.
[01:03:09.978 --> 01:03:18.220]  We're going to have a special dinner for the key figures in state of Texas that are on board with Ivan and the Office of Retribution.
[01:03:19.501 --> 01:03:20.241]  And that's key.
[01:03:20.481 --> 01:03:26.403]  You and Ivan and others are all... We have Attorney General suing, blocking, trying to put Paxson in prison.
[01:03:26.463 --> 01:03:27.304]  We're fighting back.
[01:03:27.964 --> 01:03:31.245]  Soros trying to take over local governments, but we're fighting back through the governments we control.
[01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:34.341]  That's right.
[01:03:34.621 --> 01:03:37.163]  And it's got to start from the bottom up.
[01:03:37.744 --> 01:03:45.331]  We're focusing more on the rural counties, the smaller counties, places like Hays County, that's down where we're at over near Dripping Springs.
[01:03:45.351 --> 01:03:47.473]  You know, not the big ones.
[01:03:47.873 --> 01:03:49.394]  We've lost Travels County.
[01:03:49.414 --> 01:03:50.455]  We've lost Barrett County.
[01:03:50.736 --> 01:03:51.676]  We're not going to focus there.
[01:03:51.696 --> 01:03:53.638]  We're going to focus on the places that we can focus.
[01:03:54.139 --> 01:03:57.582]  And by the way, Hays is small, like a half million people.
[01:03:58.809 --> 01:03:59.229]  No, right.
[01:03:59.289 --> 01:04:01.711]  It's not small, you know, compared to the other two.
[01:04:01.751 --> 01:04:04.813]  But yeah, Harris County, there's nothing we can do about Houston.
[01:04:05.314 --> 01:04:06.935]  I mean, it's just the way it is.
[01:04:07.435 --> 01:04:10.737]  But we're going to focus on the rest of the state and the others will follow.
[01:04:10.957 --> 01:04:17.122]  When we, the people, get involved and then we start changing the demographics... No, Doc, that's all great, even in the mid and long term.
[01:04:17.142 --> 01:04:23.666]  But desperately now, give us your Army Special Operations acumen on what is Trump going to do?
[01:04:23.706 --> 01:04:24.607]  What should we be watching out for?
[01:04:26.010 --> 01:04:26.991]  What should Trump be doing?
[01:04:27.591 --> 01:04:29.512]  He should be continuing what he's doing.
[01:04:29.552 --> 01:04:30.613]  He should be doubling down.
[01:04:30.953 --> 01:04:34.915]  He should be doing exactly what a leader does, and stands up and says, fight, fight, fight.
[01:04:35.135 --> 01:04:35.635]  There you go.
[01:04:36.076 --> 01:04:37.056]  I mean, that's what he does.
[01:04:37.656 --> 01:04:38.557]  Leaders draw fire.
[01:04:38.597 --> 01:04:42.419]  You don't want to draw fire, but you draw fire, most of the time, verbal fire.
[01:04:42.719 --> 01:04:45.020]  Now he's drawn live fire, and that's what he's done.
[01:04:45.301 --> 01:04:47.782]  But he needs to continue on, but he changed his team out.
[01:04:49.183 --> 01:04:50.403]  They're going to work that detail.
[01:04:50.824 --> 01:04:54.726]  I can't say too much more about that, because I just don't know any more about what the detail is going to do.
[01:04:55.246 --> 01:05:00.130]  But if I were them, I'd be playing whack-a-mole with these guys and throwing them off on their heels.
[01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:01.031]  Absolutely.
[01:05:01.071 --> 01:05:06.855]  In closing, I'm really concerned about truck bombs, poisoning, blowing this plane up.
[01:05:07.936 --> 01:05:09.357]  People say, well, the Globalists just lost.
[01:05:09.778 --> 01:05:10.518]  No, they're not beat.
[01:05:10.538 --> 01:05:11.319]  They're more desperate.
[01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:13.981]  How does Trump deal with a threat like that?
[01:05:16.178 --> 01:05:19.719]  Yeah, I mean, from my perspective, he needs to continue to fortify his position.
[01:05:20.219 --> 01:05:21.159]  One thing is to articulate.
[01:05:21.179 --> 01:05:25.380]  He's able to communicate effectively through massive amounts of reach through social media.
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:27.900]  Continue to do that and escalate that pressure.
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:36.942]  But at the same time, maybe he takes a somewhat of a tactical pause in the physical domain as we basically observe what they end up doing.
[01:05:37.262 --> 01:05:38.382]  No, I totally agree.
[01:05:38.422 --> 01:05:42.603]  It's not wimpy for the King after they just tried to get him and he's winning to pull back.
[01:05:43.083 --> 01:05:43.463]  That is a...
[01:05:45.788 --> 01:05:51.011]  Let us take point, Alex Jones, as Steve Bannon comes back, Tucker Carlson, Elon Musk.
[01:05:51.111 --> 01:05:52.591]  Let the pawns get out front.
[01:05:53.032 --> 01:05:55.613]  Let the rooks, let the bishops, let the knights.
[01:05:57.134 --> 01:05:57.594]  Exactly.
[01:05:57.614 --> 01:05:59.555]  There you go.
[01:05:59.775 --> 01:06:02.857]  We'll keep going along those lines, because I know Trump's finally starting to listen.
[01:06:02.877 --> 01:06:06.859]  I'll leave it at that, that he should be, because he's already won if he just survives.
[01:06:07.799 --> 01:06:13.702]  Yeah, I mean, at the end of the day, it's really, the ball is in Elon's court, okay?
[01:06:14.858 --> 01:06:16.921]  It depends on how aggressive he wants to go.
[01:06:17.121 --> 01:06:26.712]  I'm convinced he's sitting on the biggest trove of criminal evidence that any human being has as it applies to those individuals that are targeting President Trump.
[01:06:27.541 --> 01:06:31.482]  And he can literally say and dangle it, but I think he's in a dangerous spot.
[01:06:31.782 --> 01:06:36.684]  The faster he lays it out, it doesn't matter who they put forward at the DNC convention.
[01:06:36.704 --> 01:06:39.905]  By the way, I know you talk about it at nauseam, but do you do a 60-second recap?
[01:06:40.265 --> 01:06:46.227]  People want to know, Elon has all the last decade of the deep state communicating, he has the evidence.
[01:06:47.802 --> 01:06:53.147]  I want to remind people that Kamala Harris's comms team used to work at Twitter 1.0.
[01:06:53.667 --> 01:07:09.041]  Imagine the communications we extract from Twitter 1.0 and all the seditious conspiratorial communications that took place in the collective of whether it's Kamala Harris, whether it was Joe Biden, whether it's Hillary Clinton.
[01:07:09.665 --> 01:07:13.069]  Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, Gavin Newscombe.
[01:07:13.489 --> 01:07:15.291]  It doesn't matter who they present for.
[01:07:15.411 --> 01:07:18.934]  All of them have Twitter accounts and all of them were involved in the censors.
[01:07:18.974 --> 01:07:20.916]  And it's a total blueprint to take them down.
[01:07:22.358 --> 01:07:23.359]  So, so... He's got it all.
[01:07:23.719 --> 01:07:27.183]  Well, Musk has gone from 100 miles an hour to 300 last week.
[01:07:27.583 --> 01:07:28.184]  I think you're right.
[01:07:28.204 --> 01:07:29.265]  I think it's imminent release.
[01:07:31.254 --> 01:07:32.254]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:07:32.454 --> 01:07:33.475]  It's fire in the hole right now.
[01:07:33.515 --> 01:07:34.535]  I mean, we've got to fire for it.
[01:07:34.775 --> 01:07:35.896]  It's called fire for effect.
[01:07:36.256 --> 01:07:38.556]  Once we know we're hitting a target, you fire it for effect.
[01:07:38.576 --> 01:07:41.297]  You keep the salvos coming because you've got to keep that pressure going.
[01:07:41.617 --> 01:07:42.458]  It's football, yeah.
[01:07:42.758 --> 01:07:47.680]  It is blocking and tackling, but right now we're moving some passes further down.
[01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:53.141]  And the last one indicator that came out today, if you look at his Twitter profile pic, it's game on.
[01:07:53.521 --> 01:07:56.723]  If you want to pull up his Twitter profile pic, it is game on.
[01:07:56.743 --> 01:07:58.903]  Guys, pull up Elon Musk's Twitter profile, please.
[01:07:59.504 --> 01:08:00.304]  Ex-profile, please.
[01:08:01.582 --> 01:08:04.243]  We went 500 X. He just put that up a few hours ago.
[01:08:04.263 --> 01:08:06.865]  I think he's all in, Alex.
[01:08:08.005 --> 01:08:09.946]  Well, Little Birdie told me that six months ago.
[01:08:09.966 --> 01:08:19.872]  I had dinner with Joe Rogan and he was saying it was off record three years ago.
[01:08:20.965 --> 01:08:22.487]  And he goes, no, I just met with Elon.
[01:08:22.507 --> 01:08:23.048]  He's totally awake.
[01:08:23.068 --> 01:08:23.989]  He's more hardcore than us.
[01:08:24.049 --> 01:08:24.409]  I said, really?
[01:08:24.429 --> 01:08:25.030]  He goes, yeah, watch.
[01:08:25.651 --> 01:08:28.354]  So I've interviewed Elon a few times, talked to him.
[01:08:28.374 --> 01:08:28.954]  I'll leave it at that.
[01:08:29.415 --> 01:08:31.978]  But yeah, Elon, you can say he's an opportunist, whatever.
[01:08:31.998 --> 01:08:32.538]  It doesn't matter.
[01:08:33.139 --> 01:08:34.000]  The guy's a genius.
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.183]  He's coming over to us because we're winning.
[01:08:36.203 --> 01:08:37.824]  And it's important to the enemy.
[01:08:37.845 --> 01:08:41.609]  You know, the old Spartan saying that women would say, come home with your shoulder on it.
[01:08:43.024 --> 01:08:44.727]  The globalists are starting to run.
[01:08:44.767 --> 01:08:45.829]  We're starting to rout them.
[01:08:45.849 --> 01:08:46.791]  They need to give up.
[01:08:47.191 --> 01:08:48.273]  We don't want to kill them.
[01:08:48.293 --> 01:08:49.355]  We don't want to hunt them down.
[01:08:49.696 --> 01:08:52.020]  But if they force us into full war, that will happen.
[01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:54.183]  It's so easy for them to give up right now.
[01:08:54.203 --> 01:08:54.905]  Do you guys speak to that?
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:57.400]  Absolutely.
[01:08:57.460 --> 01:09:01.362]  If you give up now, like we said before, the minions will spare you.
[01:09:01.382 --> 01:09:08.745]  But you've got to come out and basically put out the truth so you're giving us a good faith kind of indication that you're willing to repent.
[01:09:09.346 --> 01:09:14.288]  Absent that, we're going to continue to escalate and apply the pressure of exposure, just like you were talking about.
[01:09:14.308 --> 01:09:18.570]  And if you come after us, we still have our inherent right to self-defense.
[01:09:18.990 --> 01:09:23.492]  So if you do come to that threshold, be prepared to face those consequences.
[01:09:24.375 --> 01:09:24.615]  Yeah.
[01:09:24.675 --> 01:09:28.898]  And look, if they can't maneuver, then they're going to give up, right?
[01:09:28.918 --> 01:09:31.780]  Because they're decisively engaged right now.
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:32.421]  What does that mean?
[01:09:32.461 --> 01:09:37.164]  That means I can't maneuver on my own and get off the X and nobody can come to rescue me.
[01:09:37.545 --> 01:09:39.566]  So as long as they're decisively engaged.
[01:09:39.686 --> 01:09:40.347]  Pun intended.
[01:09:44.049 --> 01:09:46.651]  As long as they can't maneuver, Alex, we've got them boxed in.
[01:09:46.971 --> 01:09:47.312]  All right.
[01:09:47.532 --> 01:09:49.293]  And so that's that's where they're at right now.
[01:09:49.333 --> 01:09:50.594]  They just don't know it completely.
[01:09:51.730 --> 01:09:53.311]  I think they're starting to figure it out.
[01:09:53.671 --> 01:09:56.633]  Like, you see Zuckerberg come out and say Trump's a badass and he loves Trump?
[01:09:58.214 --> 01:09:59.655]  Yeah, he's literally backpedaling.
[01:09:59.675 --> 01:10:04.738]  I don't know, maybe Elon, maybe Peter Thiel provided good old Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:10:04.758 --> 01:10:09.201]  Remember, Peter Thiel is a big component of this entire conversation via J.D.
[01:10:09.241 --> 01:10:09.601]  Banz.
[01:10:09.861 --> 01:10:18.667]  Peter Thiel used to be the first outside investor of Facebook and also was on the board on Facebook up until... Sure, he's got talent.
[01:10:18.687 --> 01:10:19.587]  He's his own NSA.
[01:10:23.570 --> 01:10:31.918]  Yeah, I mean, Peter Thiel is a very critical component of this national and global discussion on where our country and the globe is going to move forward.
[01:10:31.958 --> 01:10:34.021]  So, he's somebody that needs to be observed.
[01:10:34.661 --> 01:10:45.232]  I mean, I know all the reticence behind it and the concerns that people are saying, but I think, remember that Peter Thiel used to be Elon Musk's last boss that he had.
[01:10:47.165 --> 01:10:50.508]  On balance, I think Peter Thiel is on our side in this discussion.
[01:10:50.548 --> 01:10:54.051]  Well, regardless, if they're all coming over to our side, it doesn't matter.
[01:10:54.071 --> 01:10:54.632]  It means we're winning.
[01:10:56.294 --> 01:10:57.535]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:10:58.095 --> 01:11:09.660]  And I think we're going to see a stampede as the deep state that's pathetic and a bunch of lawyers and as they figure out that they've lost, it's going to be a rush to the exits.
[01:11:10.101 --> 01:11:14.263]  I think with this resignation of Biden today, this is the rush to the exits.
[01:11:14.483 --> 01:11:17.564]  I want to mark today, and we got our own problems going forward.
[01:11:17.584 --> 01:11:23.227]  I'm not offering some utopia, folks, but this particularly anti-American, anti-God, anti-freedom group, they're on the way out.
[01:11:24.665 --> 01:11:30.627]  Yep, they have six weeks left to make an indication that they're coming over to the side of truth.
[01:11:31.187 --> 01:11:37.168]  If they don't do that, be prepared to face maximum consequences allowable under the law.
[01:11:37.628 --> 01:11:41.769]  Legally, morally, ethically, peacefully, and patriotic.
[01:11:42.269 --> 01:11:46.611]  Well, they drew first blood, so won't do anything offensive, but in the info war they're gonna lose.
[01:11:46.651 --> 01:11:48.071]  Both of you, how do people find your great work?
[01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:54.833]  DrPeteChambers.com, just DrPeteChambers.com, that's where I'm at.
[01:11:55.374 --> 01:11:58.778]  And check out IvanRickland.substack.com, just posted one.
[01:11:59.219 --> 01:12:03.385]  It's basically titled, The Whistleblower's Guide to Amnesty.
[01:12:04.126 --> 01:12:05.448]  Alright, talk to you soon, God bless you.
[01:12:06.586 --> 01:12:07.586]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:12:07.586 --> 01:12:09.786]  All right, we have some huge guests on tomorrow.
[01:12:09.786 --> 01:12:12.106]  Some of the most famous military veterans there are.
[01:12:12.106 --> 01:12:15.466]   Like, when we have them on, you're like, "Oh, those are the most famous."
[01:12:15.466 --> 01:12:17.905]  But they're going to expose the attempt to kill Trump.
[01:12:17.905 --> 01:12:18.905]  They're like Hulk Hogan.
[01:12:18.905 --> 01:12:19.905]  They're done.
[01:12:19.905 --> 01:12:20.905]  They're not going to hide it.
[01:12:20.905 --> 01:12:24.784]   They're going to expose the attempt at assassination eight days ago and what it means.
[01:12:25.509 --> 01:12:30.732]  But as predicted here two weeks ago, I said on the weekend of the 20th, the 21st, he will resign.
[01:12:31.373 --> 01:12:36.236]  He's not leaving the White House, but he's going to resign that position as the nominee.
[01:12:36.276 --> 01:12:37.317]  So who will it be?
[01:12:37.397 --> 01:12:38.257]  Kamala Harris.
[01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:42.900]  Michael Obama.
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:44.101]  I'm sorry, Michelle Obama.
[01:12:44.842 --> 01:12:45.842]  Will it be Governor Whitmer?
[01:12:45.862 --> 01:12:46.823]  Will it be Gavin Newsom?
[01:12:46.843 --> 01:12:48.364]  Will it be Kamala Harris like you're saying?
[01:12:49.064 --> 01:12:49.805]  Roger Stone.
[01:12:51.092 --> 01:12:57.214]  At the 11th hour and the 59 minute joins us to talk about the incredible developments happening in our world.
[01:12:57.254 --> 01:12:57.554]  Roger.
[01:12:59.535 --> 01:13:02.776]  Alex, it is great to be back with you.
[01:13:03.476 --> 01:13:14.459]  It's really extraordinary as I look back in 2018 in an interview with Alex Newman at the New American, I predicted the assassination attempt on Donald Trump.
[01:13:14.799 --> 01:13:20.841]  Thank God I was that that that he had the protection of the Lord and that he survived.
[01:13:21.508 --> 01:13:29.695]  Our hearts go out to Corey Campantori, a great Italian-American, as well as a firefighter and his family and all those who are wounded.
[01:13:29.755 --> 01:13:38.126]   But Alex, I also predicted, as you know, Three years ago that Joe Biden would not be the Democrat nominee.
[01:13:38.186 --> 01:13:44.251]  I should have said, your prediction three years ago, we'll pull it up, have it tonight or tomorrow, people can find it.
[01:13:44.612 --> 01:13:56.082]  When we post this to X and Alex Jones, put it on the front, you, like a parrot on PCP, you literally kept saying Biden will step down by the nomination or by the convention.
[01:13:56.162 --> 01:13:58.664]  You were just confirmed in spades.
[01:13:58.684 --> 01:13:59.345]  What do you make of this?
[01:14:00.871 --> 01:14:04.494]  Well, we go into a very uncertain period.
[01:14:04.514 --> 01:14:09.498]  I mean, first of all, Joe Biden got 95% of the 7000 delegates.
[01:14:10.298 --> 01:14:15.622]  The process now for replacing him is a little obtuse.
[01:14:16.022 --> 01:14:22.708]  First of all, it's interesting that Biden did this by releasing a letter, which he specifically said he would not be endorsing any candidate.
[01:14:23.288 --> 01:14:28.292]  And then literally four minutes later, he formally endorsed Kamala Harris.
[01:14:28.937 --> 01:14:37.827]  My sources tell me that Biden is furious at Barack Obama, who he clearly knows has orchestrated his ouster.
[01:14:38.147 --> 01:14:47.678]  He's equally angry at Bill Clinton because he thinks that Clinton said one thing to his face, but we're colluding with Obama behind their back.
[01:14:48.038 --> 01:14:51.240]  The Obamas and the Clintons are not political allies.
[01:14:51.701 --> 01:14:55.083]  Key in this whole thing, Alex, was Nancy Pelosi.
[01:14:55.904 --> 01:15:09.734]  Biden, in the end, only had access granted by the gatekeeper Hunter Biden and Jill Biden, both of whom were in favor of Joe staying in the race.
[01:15:11.742 --> 01:15:29.131]  We're Pelosi, Congressman James Clyburn, the African-American who was instrumental to the revival of Biden's career in the South Carolina primary, despite Biden's record as opposing the desegregation of Wilmington schools or his authorship of the 1994 crime bill.
[01:15:30.731 --> 01:15:36.911]   which has been used, I think, to unfairly incarcerate hundreds of thousands, if not
[01:15:36.911 --> 01:15:44.911]   millions of poor people and African Americans for the first time non-criminal, non-violent
[01:15:44.911 --> 01:15:47.811]  crime of possession of small amounts of drugs.
[01:15:47.811 --> 01:15:51.511]   People who belong in drug treatment programs not being housed in...
[01:15:51.511 --> 01:15:54.591]   No, no, Roger, I love you and you're already all over the country and you give the general
[01:15:54.591 --> 01:15:56.032]  message to the public.
[01:15:56.210 --> 01:15:59.692]  I appreciate that, but look, it's coming out they tried to kill Trump.
[01:16:00.072 --> 01:16:03.933]  Senators like Johnson and Hawley are coming out and saying it's a cover-up, they tried to kill Trump.
[01:16:04.714 --> 01:16:06.214]  This is a collapse for the deep state.
[01:16:06.274 --> 01:16:07.595]  What do you expect them to pull next?
[01:16:08.871 --> 01:16:26.944]  Well, I mean, first of all, Alex, this is not surprising to me based on my examination of the Kennedy assassination, my book, The Man Who Killed Kennedy, the case against LBJ, all of these same agencies and power centers in the country were complicit in the murder of John F. Kennedy.
[01:16:27.684 --> 01:16:34.274]   So there's just too many Problems with this public story, even as we know it.
[01:16:34.794 --> 01:16:47.787]  Clearly, at a minimum, this, the guy they quickly identified, Lee Harvey Oswald style, as the killer, was, had unfettered access to, with a ladder, to the roof of this building.
[01:16:48.128 --> 01:16:53.193]  Drones, high-tech explosives, sneaking a gun on the building, it's so obvious.
[01:16:54.996 --> 01:16:59.820]  I mean, and he's clearly seen by people who try to point him out to law enforcement.
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:05.184]  We're told that he came face to face with a cop who he waved his weapon at him, the cop.
[01:17:06.201 --> 01:17:08.762]  Did he or did he not radio that information disappears?
[01:17:08.782 --> 01:17:08.902]  Yes.
[01:17:09.242 --> 01:17:11.423]  Why was Trump not removed from the premises?
[01:17:11.463 --> 01:17:13.764]  And by the way, since you mentioned it, we'll play the clip in a moment.
[01:17:14.165 --> 01:17:16.145]  Trump said on Fox News he was not warned.
[01:17:16.706 --> 01:17:18.166]  Thank God Trump's talking about this.
[01:17:18.226 --> 01:17:21.368]  They literally walked him into a trap.
[01:17:21.408 --> 01:17:22.968]  I know he's hired Eric Prince.
[01:17:23.048 --> 01:17:24.729]  I know the former Delta Force is coming in.
[01:17:25.149 --> 01:17:26.230]  That's good news, Roger.
[01:17:26.290 --> 01:17:31.172]  But what do you think, before we play this clip, what do you think inside the deep state they're doing?
[01:17:31.212 --> 01:17:33.233]  They have got to be shitting their britches.
[01:17:34.597 --> 01:17:39.742]  Well, look, I think that they have played their ace card and it has not worked.
[01:17:39.782 --> 01:17:45.267]  It wasn't supposed to work like this, but through the grace of God, Trump survived.
[01:17:45.868 --> 01:17:54.977]  The whole America First movement would be in disarray and the authoritarian leftists would be prepared to steal the White House.
[01:17:55.117 --> 01:17:56.338]  Yeah, that's my next question.
[01:17:56.378 --> 01:17:58.060]  If Trump would have been killed, what's the aftermath?
[01:17:59.512 --> 01:18:01.013]  You know, that's an excellent question.
[01:18:01.153 --> 01:18:06.777]  Under our party rules, the Republican National Committee meets to select a new nominee for president.
[01:18:07.598 --> 01:18:13.922]  The move in the party would probably be, ironically, to nominate Senator Vance.
[01:18:13.942 --> 01:18:16.484]  It's hard to point to any other figure.
[01:18:16.604 --> 01:18:18.886]  He has, of course, the Trump imprimatur.
[01:18:18.906 --> 01:18:21.388]  I don't even want to speculate about it, though.
[01:18:22.088 --> 01:18:27.232]  Roger, we've got to do that, because imagine they're going to try it again, and that's why we're telling them, don't do it.
[01:18:28.528 --> 01:18:30.109]  Well, that's a different question.
[01:18:30.269 --> 01:18:39.272]  I agree with you entirely that these people are desperate, they're hysterical, they're apoplectic because they don't want to face justice.
[01:18:39.352 --> 01:18:41.032]  What they keep saying is revenge.
[01:18:41.052 --> 01:18:42.373]  It has nothing to do with revenge.
[01:18:42.793 --> 01:18:45.213]  It has to do with equal protection under the law.
[01:18:45.514 --> 01:18:51.634]   In fact, we were persecuted- Trump has a responsibility to stop them.
[01:18:51.634 --> 01:18:53.993]  And we were persecuted when we didn't break the law.
[01:18:53.993 --> 01:18:58.594]   They broke the law, they engaged in treason for which they have faced no consequences
[01:18:58.594 --> 01:18:59.833]  whatsoever.
[01:18:59.833 --> 01:19:04.353]   So they know that some of them, not all of them, that some of them can be charged with
[01:19:04.353 --> 01:19:11.314]   treason and other crimes beyond which we haven't had expired statute of limitations.
[01:19:11.314 --> 01:19:16.074]   That's what they're, even now they're engaging in activities that are treasonous.
[01:19:16.074 --> 01:19:18.673]  And if that is proven, they know the consequences.
[01:19:18.673 --> 01:19:21.993]  That's why they're so desperate to stop Donald Trump.
[01:19:21.993 --> 01:19:23.394]  And Trump is like- No, I totally agree.
[01:19:23.394 --> 01:19:25.273]  You can smell the route.
[01:19:25.273 --> 01:19:28.434]  Biden steps down, as I predicted today.
[01:19:28.434 --> 01:19:30.354]  The Democratic Party is in total free for all.
[01:19:30.354 --> 01:19:31.273]  We gotta come back.
[01:19:32.168 --> 01:19:38.616]  Next segment, I ask you then, who do they, you predicted, and listeners, I wish I had a big enough crew, they're a great crew.
[01:19:39.236 --> 01:19:47.286]  You've probably said the last three years, let's not exaggerate, 100 times conservatively, that he would be replaced by or before the convention.
[01:19:47.346 --> 01:19:47.946]  You were correct.
[01:19:48.667 --> 01:19:49.668]  You predicted Big Mike.
[01:19:49.868 --> 01:19:50.728]  We'll see if you're right.
[01:19:50.828 --> 01:19:52.469]  Hillary's jockeying you for the position.

[01:20:37.866 --> 01:20:38.166]  Stay with us.
[01:20:42.237 --> 01:21:12.675]   Here I am a week ago and the full clips everywhere it's going viral like 8 million views last clip I saw of me saying he'll resign by the 20th or 21st that's how I know that it will take two hours to explain it but I was watching all the pressure knowing he was jockeying behind the scenes guessing it'd be a weekend here's the clip and I saw such incredible deep state pressure last week I said I think Biden will be gone By the... I think I said the 20th or 21st.
[01:21:12.795 --> 01:21:16.277]  According to multiple Democratic sources, this is happening all of a sudden.
[01:21:16.317 --> 01:21:19.238]  Everyone said it would happen gradually and then all at once, and that's what's happening.
[01:21:19.539 --> 01:21:23.801]  According to my sources, President Biden has agreed to step down as a Democratic nominee.
[01:21:24.561 --> 01:21:26.122]  It will happen as early as this weekend.
[01:21:26.182 --> 01:21:27.723]  A speech has been drafted for him.
[01:21:28.523 --> 01:21:32.345]  Alex, I have to say, I... Alright, Roger, I'm interrupting you.
[01:21:32.525 --> 01:21:34.286]  You've been totally on target on this.
[01:21:34.306 --> 01:21:36.287]  You got interrupted by the break.
[01:21:37.063 --> 01:21:40.844]  Who do they try to replace Biden with?
[01:21:40.864 --> 01:21:49.126]  I see Obama saying he wasn't for getting rid of Biden a month ago, a week ago, and we knew he was behind getting rid of him.
[01:21:49.506 --> 01:21:51.107]  Now Hillary says we support Kamala.
[01:21:51.127 --> 01:21:54.848]  I think they're going to try to replace Kamala.
[01:21:54.868 --> 01:21:56.068]  What do you think, Roger Stone?
[01:21:57.048 --> 01:22:01.370]  Well, first of all, Alex, I think it's important to note that the dynamics right now are still very fluid.
[01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:02.670]  Nothing here is decided.
[01:22:03.203 --> 01:22:10.343]   Kamala Harris has tried to move aggressively to consolidate her position.
[01:22:10.343 --> 01:22:16.163]   She has one very strong argument going for her, and that is the $280 million that's already
[01:22:16.163 --> 01:22:23.323]   been raised in the Biden-Harris committee can legally be used for her campaign for federal
[01:22:23.323 --> 01:22:29.283]   office, whereas a new candidate could not access that money, would have to start raising
[01:22:29.283 --> 01:22:35.003]   money all over again, particularly at a time that the Silicon Valley wallets are starting
[01:22:35.003 --> 01:22:36.203]  to zip.
[01:22:36.216 --> 01:22:43.881]  They can now only count on Indians in the trial bar, Indian casinos and the trial bar, as well as labor unions.
[01:22:43.921 --> 01:22:45.522]  But they have to start from scratch.
[01:22:46.543 --> 01:22:55.911]  She is, it's notable that Barack Obama, who of course orchestrated all of this, pointedly has not endorsed Kamala Harris.
[01:22:56.251 --> 01:22:59.134]  That is potentially problematic.
[01:22:59.394 --> 01:23:09.947]   Just to clarify Alex, what I've said for three years has never been that That Michelle Obama aspired to be president or that she would run for president or seek the presidency.
[01:23:09.967 --> 01:23:13.110]  What I've always said is she would end up as the nominee.
[01:23:13.450 --> 01:23:29.670]   That's because I think after the impact of the statement, plus the impact of Trump's attempted assassination, plus the impact of the debate, which is still reverberating if the polls show, as I think they will, that
[01:23:29.670 --> 01:23:36.180]   Trump beats Kamala Harris as badly as he was beating Joe Biden, that they will start
[01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:38.999]  looking for another candidate.
[01:23:38.999 --> 01:23:46.600]   This process doesn't start until August 19th. A week, a day, as we see today,
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:51.640]   is an eternity in politics. Sure, but you've got as accurate
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:56.679]   as a prediction as I do, about 98%. So it's not me saying you're wrong, but you've been saying
[01:23:56.679 --> 01:24:03.079]   for three years they removed Biden before or during the DNC and they replaced her with Big Mike.
[01:24:03.306 --> 01:24:05.267]  So are you saying Big Mike is not in the play now?
[01:24:06.228 --> 01:24:16.996]  Well, I guess what I'm saying is, at some point, I always believed that they would go to her, they being her husband and all the other globalist powers and say, look, you're the only one who can stop Trump.
[01:24:17.899 --> 01:24:32.693]   It's not that she wants to be president, but it would be a fourth term policy-wise for Barack Obama if they became persuaded it was their Political survival, if not their legal survival, that they might get her to do it.
[01:24:33.333 --> 01:24:39.097]  Her friends, people I know who know her, reporters and so on, they insist to us that she has no aspirations.
[01:24:39.177 --> 01:24:47.262]  On the other hand, as Joel Gilbert, who's been on your show, proves in his documentary and his book, she's very political when she pretends not to be.
[01:24:47.322 --> 01:24:50.024]  And she knows how to pander for votes.
[01:24:50.464 --> 01:24:54.407]  So in the end, does she give up her ideal life on the Hawaiian Islands?
[01:24:54.726 --> 01:25:01.445]   the flashy jets and making millions of dollars making propaganda films or can they convince her
[01:25:01.445 --> 01:25:09.126]   to run? If she does not run, the fact that over 50% of the delegates are non-white,
[01:25:09.126 --> 01:25:15.286]   which is why I don't think any other candidate, Newsom, JB Pritzker,
[01:25:15.342 --> 01:25:24.631]  Pritzker, the enormous governor of Illinois, or... No, I get it.
[01:25:24.671 --> 01:25:26.893]  The gimmick of her being black is great.
[01:25:26.913 --> 01:25:28.975]  I'm not saying you're wrong.
[01:25:29.055 --> 01:25:30.496]  It's not a gimmick, it's a fact.
[01:25:31.097 --> 01:25:34.280]  No, no, but you've been right so far, so you still think McMike, maybe.
[01:25:35.305 --> 01:25:39.947]  Well, and either that, it's either, neither they persuade Michelle Obama.
[01:25:39.987 --> 01:25:41.048]  So that's in play.
[01:25:41.108 --> 01:25:43.369]  I think that's still a possibility.
[01:25:43.569 --> 01:25:49.252]  Because remember, Kamala Harris, her vice presidential office has been a disaster.
[01:25:49.272 --> 01:25:50.593]  She's burned through staff.
[01:25:50.893 --> 01:25:52.674]  Her campaigns were a fiasco.
[01:25:52.974 --> 01:26:07.840]   There's nothing here to indicate that she knows how to operate against real operators like the Obamas and the Clintons, who in this case, Well, despite the fact that they historically dislike each other, they're both united because Hillary's trying to find her way to weasel into this.
[01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:08.921]  Well, that was my next question.
[01:26:08.961 --> 01:26:11.501]  Who does Kamala ally with if the money's behind her?
[01:26:11.942 --> 01:26:16.003]  And then Hillary with all these PR stories about her being the nominee.
[01:26:16.043 --> 01:26:16.643]  What is that about?
[01:26:17.819 --> 01:26:24.422]  Well, put it this way, if Kamala Harris puts Hillary Clinton on the ticket and she gets elected, she'll need a food taster.
[01:26:24.842 --> 01:26:26.142]  And I think she knows that.
[01:26:26.683 --> 01:26:48.317]   So I'd be far more likely that you try to change the electoral map so that you would go, for example, to Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, or Cooper, who is the governor, I think, of Kentucky, or you would go someplace that made some political sense.
[01:26:48.796 --> 01:26:54.796]   Gavin Newsom, I don't think he runs for president, but he's plausibly a vice president, particularly
[01:26:54.796 --> 01:26:59.036]   since they have a money problem and Newsom is a money machine, not only because he's
[01:26:59.036 --> 01:27:04.555]   a Getty, but also because of his access to all of the- >> Chairman, let's pull back, big picture.
[01:27:04.555 --> 01:27:10.556]   What is the deep state thinking right now after their clear assassination on Trump missed?
[01:27:10.556 --> 01:27:13.716]  There is panic, so you've got chaos on here.
[01:27:13.716 --> 01:27:18.076]   At the meantime, you have Donald Trump, who has a smooth running machine, who just had
[01:27:18.076 --> 01:27:22.055]  one of the most unifying conventions.
[01:27:22.055 --> 01:27:26.356]   He had both Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis endorse him and he gave them nothing.
[01:27:26.356 --> 01:27:28.636]  He sacrificed nothing.
[01:27:28.636 --> 01:27:31.835]  That shows that they think he's going to win.
[01:27:31.835 --> 01:27:38.436]   He put forward what is his manifesto, a populist, conservative, America-fest manifesto.
[01:27:38.436 --> 01:27:40.835]  No, sorry, Democrats.
[01:27:40.835 --> 01:27:48.436]   The Heritage Foundation's project 2024 is a conservative think tank's agenda.
[01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:50.120]  There's just some good things in there.
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:54.203]  There's some things in there I don't agree with and that Donald Trump has never supported.
[01:27:54.563 --> 01:27:55.824]  Sorry, that is not true.
[01:27:55.844 --> 01:27:57.485]  Sure, so they're in full panic mode.
[01:27:57.505 --> 01:27:57.925]  What do they do?
[01:28:00.081 --> 01:28:02.862]  Look, like you, Alex, I think there are two possibilities.
[01:28:02.982 --> 01:28:04.182]  One of them is world war.
[01:28:04.902 --> 01:28:06.403]  They're perfectly capable of that.
[01:28:06.423 --> 01:28:07.323]  We're on the brink of it.
[01:28:07.883 --> 01:28:13.264]  If they push Ukraine into NATO in September, they may get that war, God forbid.
[01:28:13.284 --> 01:28:16.285]  And the other one is, of course, another assault on the president.
[01:28:16.325 --> 01:28:26.129]   I think the president, who I've not talked to, needs to at least examine everything regarding the failures Of Butler, Pennsylvania.
[01:28:26.169 --> 01:28:35.517]  It's very clear the Secret Service was aware of the presence, had identified and knew that this guy was there for 62 minutes and they didn't evacuate Trump.
[01:28:36.017 --> 01:28:37.839]  And by the way, let me play that clip.
[01:28:37.879 --> 01:28:38.740]  That's the good news.
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:43.844]  He came out today with Vance on Fox News and said, if I would have been warned, I wouldn't have gone on stage.
[01:28:43.864 --> 01:28:46.046]  They wait until he's about to go on stage.
[01:28:46.066 --> 01:28:47.487]  26 minutes, they bring out the shooter.
[01:28:48.266 --> 01:28:52.445]   consensus with the military and the Pentagon I've talked to literally 24
[01:28:52.445 --> 01:28:57.306]   people now the military knows this was staged they met with Trump I'll leave
[01:28:57.306 --> 01:29:01.846]   it at that Eric Prince is coming in they know this so now Trump gets it here he
[01:29:01.846 --> 01:29:07.305]   is beginning to expose what happens eight days ago here he is.
[01:29:07.305 --> 01:29:09.305]  for an hour beforehand.
[01:29:08.944 --> 01:29:09.124]  Yeah.
[01:29:09.404 --> 01:29:11.806]  No one told you not to take the stage?
[01:29:11.966 --> 01:29:13.007]  No, nobody mentioned it.
[01:29:13.047 --> 01:29:14.349]  Nobody said there was a problem.
[01:29:15.229 --> 01:29:16.511]  And I would have waited for 15.
[01:29:16.771 --> 01:29:20.975]  They could have said, let's wait for 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 5 minutes, something.
[01:29:21.856 --> 01:29:23.517]  Nobody said, I think that was a mistake.
[01:29:23.897 --> 01:29:25.499]  How did somebody get on that roof?
[01:29:25.639 --> 01:29:27.100]  And why wasn't he reported?
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:28.822]  Because people saw that he was on the roof.
[01:29:28.842 --> 01:29:32.946]   I mean, you had Trumpers screaming.
[01:29:33.587 --> 01:29:38.593]  The woman in the red shirt, she was screaming, there's a man on the roof.
[01:29:38.653 --> 01:29:41.696]  And then other people said, there's a man on the roof who's got a gun.
[01:29:41.716 --> 01:29:46.181]  And that was quite a bit before I walked onto the stage.
[01:29:46.622 --> 01:29:49.205]  So you would have thought somebody would have done something about it.
[01:29:49.892 --> 01:29:56.177]  Former President Trump saying for the first time, exclusively to Jesse Watters Prime Time, that no one warned him not to take the stage.
[01:29:56.257 --> 01:29:58.860]  Even though they knew it was a threat, there was a threat.
[01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:01.722]  And it was this guy, almost an hour beforehand.
[01:30:02.082 --> 01:30:03.824]  The Secret Service under mounting pressure.
[01:30:04.204 --> 01:30:07.227]  Pressure following the assassination attempt of former President Trump on Saturday.
[01:30:07.687 --> 01:30:10.410]  One week later, we still have very few answers about the shooter.
[01:30:11.050 --> 01:30:14.872]  The motive and the stunning security lapses, something we have learned.
[01:30:14.892 --> 01:30:21.796]  20-year-old Thomas Crooks likely flew a drone over the fairgrounds in Butler, Pennsylvania just hours before- Alright, pause here.
[01:30:21.816 --> 01:30:22.136]  Pause here.
[01:30:23.035 --> 01:30:35.209]  This is what I said eight days ago when I was saying now Trump has to address this assassination attempt, get on the offense against Mayor Orris and the Secret Service leadership that did this to put him off balance because they did this.
[01:30:35.629 --> 01:30:36.991]  And thank God he's doing it.
[01:30:37.051 --> 01:30:45.518]   I talked to people that met with him Wednesday and Thursday with the Delta Force and They want the bad guys to know.
[01:30:45.898 --> 01:30:46.938]  Eric Prince, all of it.
[01:30:47.358 --> 01:30:48.918]  Trump now knows they're trying to kill him.
[01:30:49.318 --> 01:30:57.520]  So the fact that he's admitting that and saying it and starting to expose them for the stand down 26 minutes before he goes up to speak.
[01:30:57.540 --> 01:31:01.521]  They're like, there's a guy on the roof and they bring Trump out with a guy on the roof with a gun.
[01:31:01.541 --> 01:31:05.121]  I mean, my God, Roger, let's finish the clip and we'll go to Roger.
[01:31:05.141 --> 01:31:08.782]  But this is literally like golf teeing up the president for a long drive.
[01:31:08.822 --> 01:31:09.102]  Here it is.
[01:31:10.055 --> 01:31:12.237]  ...in front of tens of thousands of people.
[01:31:12.297 --> 01:31:18.523]  Officials say the predetermined path suggests Crooks flew the drone more than once to scope out the event site.
[01:31:19.084 --> 01:31:26.671]  At least four congressional committees are planning to probe the security failures that allowed him to gain access to the nearby rooftop that he fired from.
[01:31:27.332 --> 01:31:31.656]  Republican Senator Josh Hawley says he's heard from multiple whistleblowers.
[01:31:33.473 --> 01:31:40.017]  The idea that you could have all of this time elapse and nobody notices, no law enforcement notices he's on the roof.
[01:31:40.197 --> 01:31:46.221]  Whistleblowers tell me that law enforcement were actually on different channels, different radio communication channels.
[01:31:46.241 --> 01:31:49.062]  There were multiple different channels and they weren't coordinated.
[01:31:49.903 --> 01:31:50.603]  We need answers.
[01:31:50.743 --> 01:31:54.766]  The director of the Secret Service, Kimberly Cheadle, expected to face tough questions when she testified.
[01:31:55.836 --> 01:32:00.659]  And Josh Hawley went there yesterday and was thrown off the premises, Roger.
[01:32:00.719 --> 01:32:05.762]  So, this is so key that Trump is doing this, and this is all coming out.
[01:32:05.822 --> 01:32:07.223]  This is exactly what he should be doing.
[01:32:08.804 --> 01:32:09.645]  Another thing, Alex.
[01:32:10.005 --> 01:32:15.168]  Incredible that the Butler County Sheriff's Office, not a single officer has their body cam on.
[01:32:15.449 --> 01:32:16.189]  Why would that be?
[01:32:17.170 --> 01:32:18.390]  Roger, Roger, Roger.
[01:32:18.831 --> 01:32:19.851]  No press conference.
[01:32:19.871 --> 01:32:23.053]  If it's a kidnapped kid or a car wreck, there's a press conference.
[01:32:23.514 --> 01:32:25.255]  Why is everything so silent, Roger?
[01:32:26.072 --> 01:32:29.195]  Well, look, I think we're in a point, Alex, that I think is very key.
[01:32:29.956 --> 01:32:38.645]  One thing that Richard Nixon once told Senator Joe McCarthy, when you're shooting a rat, you've got to shoot straight because you've got to be sure you kill the rat.
[01:32:39.125 --> 01:32:44.131]  So there's a lot of information here to process because we won't get this exactly right.
[01:32:44.171 --> 01:32:56.281]   There's already more than enough Absolutely indisputable evidence of malfeasance and potentially far worse obviously by both state and federal authorities.
[01:32:56.742 --> 01:32:58.644]  Is there another shooter on a water tower?
[01:32:59.084 --> 01:33:01.606]  I haven't had enough time to investigate those stories.
[01:33:02.767 --> 01:33:05.449]  Is there an acoustical analysis?
[01:33:07.471 --> 01:33:10.654]  We're not sure about the water tower but definitely under the shooter in the window.
[01:33:12.225 --> 01:33:17.209]  So a second shooter, making this very much like the Kennedy assassination.
[01:33:17.870 --> 01:33:33.282]  Alex, none of this surprises me because these same entities, the CIA, the Secret Service, the FBI, and in Dallas, I hate to say it, but the Dallas County Sheriff's Office and the Dallas Police Department, all in on the murder of John F. Kennedy.
[01:33:34.321 --> 01:33:35.061]  You're totally right.
[01:33:35.101 --> 01:33:36.362]  So, Roger, we got 10 minutes left.
[01:33:36.382 --> 01:33:37.383]  I'm going to try to give you the floor.
[01:33:38.063 --> 01:33:40.925]  But, I mean, this is so epic.
[01:33:41.085 --> 01:33:43.826]  Trump is John Wayne for real.
[01:33:43.966 --> 01:33:45.427]  George Washington 2.0.
[01:33:46.007 --> 01:33:49.969]  He's coming out and saying, yeah, the government stood down, which he should be doing.
[01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:53.891]  The deep state, it's got to be really concerned.
[01:33:53.991 --> 01:33:54.652]  What do you think?
[01:33:54.672 --> 01:33:56.613]  I already asked this again, but I'm asking again.
[01:33:57.093 --> 01:33:59.794]  What are they going to do when everything's turning against them?
[01:33:59.854 --> 01:34:01.275]  I think another assassination attempt.
[01:34:01.575 --> 01:34:02.496]  They have nothing to lose.
[01:34:03.786 --> 01:34:09.313]  Well, you know, I fear that maybe they try to poison him or some kind of truck bomb.
[01:34:09.433 --> 01:34:11.276]  I mean, look, I'm not...
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:15.182]  I'm a political, I can tell you the political dynamics.
[01:34:15.242 --> 01:34:20.225]  I don't have the kind of intelligence or military connections or sources that you do.
[01:34:20.245 --> 01:34:20.925]  I have a few.
[01:34:21.766 --> 01:34:25.608]  But this, and you definitely understand how they think.
[01:34:25.708 --> 01:34:31.171]  We both understand what they're capable since they've tried to destroy both of us.
[01:34:31.291 --> 01:34:34.473]  But here we are still fighting for the country.
[01:34:35.833 --> 01:34:38.015]  And winning, and winning, here's a God.
[01:34:38.695 --> 01:34:40.440]  In fact, why don't you talk about God for a moment?
[01:34:40.721 --> 01:34:44.071]  Trump came out in a speech, three times in a speech, called on God.
[01:34:44.131 --> 01:34:44.913]  That was so important.
[01:34:46.591 --> 01:34:52.815]  You know, Alex, look, I'm coming off of doing three hours of live radio, 77 WABC.
[01:34:53.255 --> 01:34:58.178]  If it were not for Brain Force Plus, this wouldn't be such a great interview.
[01:34:58.958 --> 01:35:00.859]  But we live in an incredible time.
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:02.400]  This is very evocative of 1968.
[01:35:03.981 --> 01:35:08.284]  President Lyndon Johnson, wildly unpopular, withdraws from the race.
[01:35:08.604 --> 01:35:12.206]  The Democrat Party split badly by a foreign war.
[01:35:13.048 --> 01:35:18.110]  With a radical left wing opposing the Vietnam War.
[01:35:18.870 --> 01:35:29.293]  Donald Trump staging the greatest political comeback since Richard Nixon to storm the early primaries and caucuses to grab the nomination.
[01:35:29.813 --> 01:35:32.134]  There are so many anomalies here.
[01:35:32.534 --> 01:35:41.157]  And of course, the 1960 election always had an overhang of assassination because of the murder of Robert F. Kennedy, because of the murder of JFK.
[01:35:42.177 --> 01:35:46.298]  Both of which reminded voters of the brutal murder of John Kennedy.
[01:35:46.638 --> 01:35:50.199]  So the pal of assassination was over that race.
[01:35:50.239 --> 01:35:51.900]  It's now over this race.
[01:35:52.340 --> 01:35:56.121]  We have to pray for protection for Donald Trump.
[01:35:56.701 --> 01:35:58.862]  That is, I talk about it on my show.
[01:35:58.902 --> 01:36:00.082]  I talk about it on your show.
[01:36:00.402 --> 01:36:06.064]  I understand leftists, elitists make fun of us for believing in the Holy Spirit.
[01:36:06.324 --> 01:36:07.064]  What the hell with them?
[01:36:07.644 --> 01:36:09.525]  I've had miracles in my own life.
[01:36:09.846 --> 01:36:15.649]  Donald Trump's, the hand of God has been seen through this entire proceeding, if you think about it.
[01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:17.750]  I totally agree.
[01:36:17.950 --> 01:36:18.971]  You know Trump well.
[01:36:19.691 --> 01:36:22.533]  He was glowing at the RNC on Thursday.
[01:36:23.442 --> 01:36:25.265]  And he is even more hardcore now.
[01:36:25.866 --> 01:36:33.959]  Imagine what he's going to do as president now that he's been shot in the ear, now that you understand what's happening.
[01:36:33.979 --> 01:36:37.926]  Can we get a few minutes on what you think Trump's going to do when he gets back in office?
[01:36:40.132 --> 01:36:41.654]  Alex, it's an excellent question.
[01:36:42.194 --> 01:36:46.058]  Look, I saw him in Milwaukee.
[01:36:46.119 --> 01:36:53.707]  I've not talked to him on the phone, but everyone around him, and I noticed this myself, there's a new serenity about him.
[01:36:54.268 --> 01:36:56.590]  There's a new calm about him.
[01:36:57.151 --> 01:37:02.967]   He was always confident, but But you can see him moving towards unifying rhetoric.
[01:37:03.427 --> 01:37:22.382]  He wants not just victory, he wants a political realignment in this country, which everyone who believes in freedom and opportunity, regardless of race, creed, color, as long as they're here legally, can be forged into a new political movement that puts Americans A total American rebirth!
[01:37:23.934 --> 01:37:27.136]  It's like the Democrats in 1932 with the realignment.
[01:37:27.416 --> 01:37:33.700]  It's like the Republicans with the 1968 realignment, which gets cemented by Ronald Reagan.
[01:37:34.381 --> 01:37:36.382]  We're at the cusp of history.
[01:37:36.762 --> 01:37:43.644]   Trump has an ability to get working class white, Catholic, particularly Democrat votes and
[01:37:43.644 --> 01:37:47.784]   independent votes, but he's also now proven he can get African Americans.
[01:37:47.784 --> 01:37:48.784]  He can get Hispanics.
[01:37:48.784 --> 01:37:51.344]  He can get young people.
[01:37:51.344 --> 01:37:53.204]  He can get Asians.
[01:37:53.204 --> 01:37:55.983]  Because of his message of economic opportunity.
[01:37:55.983 --> 01:37:57.944]  Everybody wants to win.
[01:37:57.944 --> 01:38:05.304]   Well, you know, people want, every American, regardless of race, wants a piece of the American
[01:38:06.068 --> 01:38:11.312]  Trump's platinum proposal, I think, is... Oh, that's what Hulk said on Hannity.
[01:38:11.332 --> 01:38:13.574]  He said, look, I've known Trump 35 years.
[01:38:13.594 --> 01:38:14.334]  You've known him 45.
[01:38:14.674 --> 01:38:15.855]  He goes, he just loves everybody.
[01:38:15.875 --> 01:38:16.636]  He wants to win.
[01:38:17.036 --> 01:38:22.300]  He's a hospitality guy with hotels and casinos and golf courses.
[01:38:22.661 --> 01:38:25.183]  That kind of guy wants prosperity, folks.
[01:38:26.684 --> 01:38:35.930]  Well, and he understands that cutting taxes and minimizing regulation is what brings economic growth and prosperity.
[01:38:36.751 --> 01:38:42.955]  The left continues to this myth that the Reagan tax cuts or the Trump tax cuts caused the major deficit.
[01:38:43.035 --> 01:38:43.175]  No.
[01:38:43.875 --> 01:38:50.520]  In fact, after Reagan's tax cuts and after Trump's tax cuts, federal revenues skyrocketed up every year.
[01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:59.627]  So the idea that they robbed that money from the Treasury, the economic opportunity that those tax cuts generated brought millions more into U.S.
[01:38:59.687 --> 01:39:00.148]  coffers.
[01:39:00.988 --> 01:39:03.070]  You know Trump so well for 45 years.
[01:39:04.531 --> 01:39:06.412]  What is, what do you think he's thinking right now?
[01:39:06.452 --> 01:39:08.793]  Because, I mean, this is incredible.
[01:39:08.813 --> 01:39:15.076]  I mean, I've talked to this Delta Force, all the people, the Feds, everybody, over 20 people the last two days.
[01:39:15.757 --> 01:39:17.058]  And we've got the ballistics.
[01:39:17.118 --> 01:39:18.498]  The lectern got shot too, folks.
[01:39:18.698 --> 01:39:19.439]  Nobody covers that.
[01:39:19.779 --> 01:39:20.659]  There's no press conference.
[01:39:20.679 --> 01:39:21.480]  They don't want to discuss it.
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:25.402]  He had at least five bullets, probably eight, barely miss him.
[01:39:25.862 --> 01:39:29.644]  That's got to freak out the deep state, but it's also got to let Trump know how real God is.
[01:39:31.237 --> 01:39:35.219]  Well, look, the government shooter here, you know, was like a modern-day Jack Ruby.
[01:39:35.339 --> 01:39:38.760]  I think that was the idea, to silence the killer.
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:50.465]  We don't even know, at this point, I'm not inclined to just believe what the Secret Service tells us, so I'm still, I don't even know for a certainty that Thomas Matthew Crooks is the shooter.
[01:39:50.585 --> 01:39:55.207]  Oh, no, no, no, all my sources, water tower shooter and a shooter under Crooks in the window.
[01:39:56.212 --> 01:40:00.413]  Yeah, well, perhaps that is Maxwell Yerrick.
[01:40:01.234 --> 01:40:06.435]  I have sources inside the Pennsylvania law enforcement community who tell me that Yerrick is a suspect.
[01:40:07.035 --> 01:40:09.616]  He has previous crimes assaulting Trump supporters.
[01:40:10.236 --> 01:40:24.401]  He does seem, I don't have any facial recognition technology, but he does seem to more closely resemble the photo of the corpse that the media has... Well, Roger, what we know is there's a shutdown on the info.
[01:40:24.861 --> 01:40:26.602]  Normally this would have been out five days ago.
[01:40:26.642 --> 01:40:30.705]  Where are the press conferences?
[01:40:30.745 --> 01:40:43.935]  Well, we only just learned that Crooks, it is alleged, stole his father's gun and that his parents, both I think sociologists or psychologists, called to report that he was a danger.
[01:40:44.275 --> 01:40:47.257]  Why are we just learning this now?
[01:40:48.198 --> 01:40:50.520]  And I said this on your show last week, Alex.
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:57.864]   I was told back in June of last year When I was in Palm Beach for the Turning Point USA conference.
[01:40:58.324 --> 01:41:02.827]  It was a great conference with Charlie Kirk and Jack Posobiec and Tucker Carlson and others.
[01:41:03.207 --> 01:41:16.155]  But an agent that I knew who was more senior, been around under previous presidents, told me that all of the requests for additional personnel or financing for Trump's protection that were being systematically denied.
[01:41:16.175 --> 01:41:17.295]  No, no, let me stop you.
[01:41:17.395 --> 01:41:27.041]   Today, the Secret Service, after denying it three days ago, admits That they refused all requests and that Trump had less than 20 Secret Service.
[01:41:27.421 --> 01:41:30.343]  That's why he had that woman who couldn't holster a gun out there.
[01:41:30.743 --> 01:41:33.544]  They literally had theater production people there.
[01:41:34.325 --> 01:41:35.265]  But let's be clear.
[01:41:35.485 --> 01:41:36.486]  I said it last week.
[01:41:36.586 --> 01:41:38.847]  The Secret Service specifically denied it.
[01:41:39.248 --> 01:41:41.709]  A hard written denial last week.
[01:41:41.769 --> 01:41:43.710]  Now they're admitting, oh no.
[01:41:43.730 --> 01:41:44.330]  Yeah, here it is.
[01:41:44.350 --> 01:41:44.390]  U.S.
[01:41:44.811 --> 01:41:48.753]  Secret Service confirms they rejected requests to strengthen Trump's security.
[01:41:49.895 --> 01:41:52.876]  It's a great piece in today's New York Post as well.
[01:41:53.996 --> 01:41:56.856]  So in closing, it's ours to lose.
[01:41:57.056 --> 01:41:58.597]  They're going to try to kill the Trump.
[01:42:00.837 --> 01:42:01.957]  God, that's good vodka.
[01:42:02.978 --> 01:42:03.298]  Go ahead.
[01:42:03.358 --> 01:42:03.798]  I'm sorry.
[01:42:04.458 --> 01:42:05.498]  What type is it?
[01:42:06.858 --> 01:42:07.859]  Just, it was a joke.
[01:42:08.259 --> 01:42:08.619]  I can see.
[01:42:08.699 --> 01:42:09.099]  I'm sure.
[01:42:09.139 --> 01:42:09.659]  Yeah, right.
[01:42:10.339 --> 01:42:13.380]  We haven't had martinis in like a long, I haven't seen you in like a year in person.
[01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:14.320]  We didn't have martinis.
[01:42:15.887 --> 01:42:16.468]  I'm ready.
[01:42:16.548 --> 01:42:19.610]  Look, I think today is, we're in uncharted territory here.
[01:42:19.630 --> 01:42:27.735]  So again, I'm not, I'm saying Trump, I think is, he really has, the convention was the smoothest I've ever seen.
[01:42:27.815 --> 01:42:32.018]  Alex, I've been to every convention since 19- Listen, I've been watching them since I was five years old.
[01:42:32.078 --> 01:42:35.680]  This was like a rock concert wrapped in an opera.
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:36.401]  This is amazing.
[01:42:37.301 --> 01:42:38.962]  Well, I spoke to Middle America.
[01:42:38.982 --> 01:42:41.824]  I mean, the point was it wasn't just a bunch of blathering politicians.
[01:42:41.864 --> 01:42:48.367]  There were some, but mostly it was, you know, average people talking about the impact of illegal immigration.
[01:42:48.488 --> 01:42:49.848]  It was pure Americana.
[01:42:50.849 --> 01:42:51.129]  Yes.
[01:42:51.689 --> 01:42:52.790]  And it was excellent.
[01:42:52.810 --> 01:43:00.900]   But also, I must tell you, being in Milwaukee for three days, A lot more black faces in this party now.
[01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:03.280]  A lot more Latinos.
[01:43:03.681 --> 01:43:05.761]  A lot more Asians.
[01:43:05.801 --> 01:43:08.182]  A lot more, much, much younger people.
[01:43:08.482 --> 01:43:10.803]  An entire generation of young conservatives.
[01:43:11.103 --> 01:43:14.704]  I give Charlie Kirk a lot of credit for this.
[01:43:15.404 --> 01:43:18.905]  But amazing how many young patriots are out there.
[01:43:19.525 --> 01:43:21.046]  It was an amazing convention.
[01:43:21.066 --> 01:43:21.766]  It was upbeat.
[01:43:21.806 --> 01:43:22.586]  It was positive.
[01:43:23.287 --> 01:43:27.928]  Look, I'm also, you ask me what I'm thinking right now if I'm Donald Trump, I'll tell you one thing.
[01:43:28.228 --> 01:43:29.249]  I'm thinking.
[01:43:29.309 --> 01:43:31.270]  When I saw Senator J.D.
[01:43:31.290 --> 01:43:40.494]  Vance call for the resignation of Joe Biden because he's not fit to be a candidate, he's not fit to be President of the United States, I know Donald Trump knows he picked the right man.
[01:43:40.934 --> 01:43:43.135]  Alright, you predicted Biden would step down, you did it right.
[01:43:44.276 --> 01:43:45.676]  It's not a prediction, dead reckoning.
[01:43:45.997 --> 01:43:46.697]  Who's their nominee?
[01:43:48.483 --> 01:43:51.806]  Alex, I'm just not, you know, I don't answer hypothetical questions.
[01:43:51.826 --> 01:43:54.548]  All I'm saying is this is a situation in flux.
[01:43:54.869 --> 01:43:56.370]  Kamala is maneuvering.
[01:43:56.730 --> 01:44:09.362]  Willie Brown, who is an old friend of mine because of our sartorial traditions, was on my best dressed list and I know him quite well, always told me that she was smarter than she appeared to be, that she was strictly tactical.
[01:44:09.862 --> 01:44:15.447]  Whether she can clinch this nomination with Obama presumably working against her.
[01:44:15.747 --> 01:44:17.068]  Nody has not endorsed her.
[01:44:17.108 --> 01:44:17.809]  That's significant.
[01:44:18.089 --> 01:44:21.172]  The Clintons have endorsed her, but I think it's disingenuous.
[01:44:21.372 --> 01:44:23.113]  So is Hillary a threat?
[01:44:24.194 --> 01:44:25.135]  Yes.
[01:44:25.195 --> 01:44:27.117]  This is why the Clintons have endorsed Kamala.
[01:44:27.137 --> 01:44:28.318]  They're trying to make their deal.
[01:44:29.016 --> 01:44:30.537]  With Obama on the other side.
[01:44:30.557 --> 01:44:37.403]  So it would be an alliance of Kamala and the Clintons, not natural allies, in order to get Hillary on the ticket.
[01:44:37.704 --> 01:44:38.144]  God forbid.
[01:44:38.164 --> 01:44:39.746]  All right, stonezone.com.
[01:44:39.766 --> 01:44:40.766]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:44:40.806 --> 01:44:41.807]  What a time to be alive.
[01:44:41.927 --> 01:44:43.609]  Roger Stone, stonezone.com.
[01:44:43.669 --> 01:44:49.374]  Alex Jones at realalexjones on X. And please support our sponsor, drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:44:49.414 --> 01:44:50.095]  Thank you, Roger.
[01:44:50.595 --> 01:44:52.777]  I'm going to commandeer some time from Chase Geyser.
[01:44:52.857 --> 01:44:56.839]  I'm going to come back a little more with more clips and more news straight ahead.
[01:44:56.919 --> 01:44:57.540]  Stay with us.
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:44:59.821]  But Roger Stone just knocked it out of the park.
[01:45:00.462 --> 01:45:01.663]  Thank you for praying for President Trump.
[01:45:03.864 --> 01:45:10.869]  All right, Chase Geyser in a few minutes is about to take over with Sunday Night Live to cover the news, cover a lot of clips and take your phone calls.
[01:45:12.571 --> 01:45:13.951]  But I wanted to just finish up here.
[01:45:13.971 --> 01:45:16.792]  We had so many big guests on today and we got a bunch of big guests tomorrow.
[01:45:17.352 --> 01:45:19.313]  Just to thank all of you for your support.
[01:45:19.993 --> 01:45:20.793]  I over-prepared.
[01:45:20.813 --> 01:45:22.654]  I covered probably 10% of what I wanted to.
[01:45:22.674 --> 01:45:25.174]  I'll do my best job tomorrow to get into it.
[01:45:25.854 --> 01:45:26.955]  This was an inside job.
[01:45:26.975 --> 01:45:28.035]  This was a terror attack.
[01:45:28.055 --> 01:45:32.696]  This was an assassination against the people and our will trying to kill our president.
[01:45:33.656 --> 01:45:35.657]  God knows I'm not perfect.
[01:45:35.677 --> 01:45:36.557]  Neither is President Trump.
[01:45:37.277 --> 01:45:38.798]  But what a time to be alive.
[01:45:39.498 --> 01:45:39.978]  And I...
[01:45:41.357 --> 01:45:43.718]  I want to play a special report right here before Chase takes over.
[01:45:44.279 --> 01:45:49.662]  But I also just want to encourage listeners to realize that you can't take a show like this for granted and spend 30 years.
[01:45:50.703 --> 01:45:53.265]  I can't do this without your word of mouth, without your prayer, without your support.
[01:45:54.946 --> 01:46:03.131]  So I need you to go to our sponsors and make the decision to support Impulsa Great Products at drjonesnaturals.com.
