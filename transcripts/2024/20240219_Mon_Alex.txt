[00:00:16.253 --> 00:00:17.033]  Infowars.
[00:00:17.374 --> 00:00:18.935]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:27.625 --> 00:00:36.735]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you've got one!
[00:00:38.877 --> 00:00:43.983]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:03.707 --> 00:01:05.488]  This is Trucker Jack.
[00:01:05.508 --> 00:01:12.092]  There's talk of a trucker boycott of the city of New York to protest the persecution of President Trump.
[00:01:13.292 --> 00:01:16.994]  Now, liberals seem to think that this is a pretty funny idea.
[00:01:17.495 --> 00:01:18.695]  Let me tell you a quick story.
[00:01:18.715 --> 00:01:23.958]  A couple years ago, a Colorado's trucker was involved in a terrible accident.
[00:01:24.018 --> 00:01:24.718]  Loss of life.
[00:01:24.758 --> 00:01:25.699]  It was tragic.
[00:01:26.926 --> 00:01:33.071]  The Colorado judge sentenced that trucker to 110 years in prison.
[00:01:33.091 --> 00:01:44.820]  Now, you decide for yourself whether or not he deserved that prison sentence, but when truck drivers from around America heard about that sentence, they organized a boycott against the state of Colorado.
[00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:49.563]  And within a month, they brought the state of Colorado to its knees.
[00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:55.488]  That judge resentenced that trucker from 110 years to 10 years in prison.
[00:01:57.867 --> 00:02:03.593]  The point is, MAGA patriots make this country run.
[00:02:03.813 --> 00:02:06.015]  Liberals, they make our coffee.
[00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:07.897]  This is Trucker Jake.
[00:02:08.357 --> 00:02:09.498]  God bless President Trump.
[00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.420]  God bless MAGA America.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.721]  God bless our truckers.
[00:02:12.761 --> 00:02:13.822]  Y'all have a blessed day.
[00:02:15.284 --> 00:02:16.125]  What's up, fam?
[00:02:16.205 --> 00:02:18.707]  So, you guys remember this movie?
[00:02:20.028 --> 00:02:20.689]  Kurt Russell.
[00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.511]  Remember how
[00:02:23.223 --> 00:02:25.825]  The area looked in the movie?
[00:02:27.787 --> 00:02:30.970]  That's what New York City is going to look like in the next few months.
[00:02:33.472 --> 00:02:42.820]  So there's reports now that the truckers all across this country on Monday will no longer be accepting any loads to New York.
[00:02:45.763 --> 00:02:49.887]  So, not only have you lost your residence...
[00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:55.782]  You also lost your businesses.
[00:02:56.683 --> 00:02:59.124]  We're soon to be losing almost all your businesses.
[00:03:00.826 --> 00:03:03.828]  And now, you done lost your supply chain.
[00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:08.391]  Good luck.
[00:03:08.791 --> 00:03:13.495]  I wish you guys the best of luck there in New York in the next coming months.
[00:03:14.155 --> 00:03:16.277]  New York, New York, New York.
[00:03:18.458 --> 00:03:18.918]  F***ing with Trump.
[00:03:18.938 --> 00:03:20.660]  F***ing with Trump.
[00:03:21.468 --> 00:03:24.749]  Now the truckers ain't trying to deliver y'all produce, y'all goods.
[00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:27.810]  For three years.
[00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:33.393]  You in New York, better get up out of there.
[00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:35.594]  Y'all think groceries are high now.
[00:03:36.934 --> 00:03:41.196]  Y'all better respect Trump's gangsters.
[00:03:42.016 --> 00:03:44.917]  And y'all better respect that MAGA crowd.
[00:03:45.397 --> 00:03:47.058]  They not playin'.
[00:03:47.098 --> 00:03:47.818]  They not playin'.
[00:03:47.978 --> 00:03:49.279]  As you can see, they not playin'.
[00:03:57.094 --> 00:03:58.535]  The people still have the power.
[00:03:58.555 --> 00:04:03.338]  Once the driverless cars and trucks are in place, the robots are in control, the real trouble starts.
[00:04:03.398 --> 00:04:04.979]  But humanity's waking up fast.
[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.623]  That's why they're trying to take out the leadership that's battling the new world order.
[00:04:09.663 --> 00:04:13.385]  That's why they're trying to take out Trump, yours truly, Tucker Carlson, and others.
[00:04:13.405 --> 00:04:19.430]  And that's why, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for your prayers, your support at InfoWarsStore.com, and most importantly...
[00:04:20.683 --> 00:04:23.084]  Your word of mouth, because I'm not doing this to lose.
[00:04:23.104 --> 00:04:26.686]  And you've got all the power when you decide to share this show and share the clips.
[00:04:26.746 --> 00:04:27.307]  And you're doing it.
[00:04:28.127 --> 00:04:29.067]  You're having a big effect.
[00:04:29.728 --> 00:04:32.829]  All right, we've got a gigantic show lined up today.
[00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.071]  So many huge subjects.
[00:04:35.091 --> 00:04:36.651]  We're going to cover them all.
[00:04:36.671 --> 00:04:39.093]  And we're doing a deep dive with four...
[00:04:40.424 --> 00:04:45.807]  Coroners, embalmers, you name it coming on about the massive blood clots killing millions.
[00:04:46.767 --> 00:04:53.451]  The scientific data and the studies admit it, but these are the actual coroners that are pulling things out of people they've never seen before.
[00:04:53.991 --> 00:04:56.213]  Not to mention all the dead babies.
[00:04:56.233 --> 00:04:56.713]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.883 --> 00:05:07.290]  In 60 seconds, I don't have time to tell you about all the incredible ingredients in Turbo Force.
[00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:17.704]  If you simply go to InfoWarsStore.com and look at the list of ingredients and look them up, every one of them is known to give you boosted, clean, focused energy without the letdown.
[00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:18.564]  We're good to go.
[00:05:39.332 --> 00:05:46.395]  Get Turbo Force today at InfoWarsStore.com and I know you will not be disappointed because thousands of others have gotten it and it has five-star reviews.
[00:05:46.415 --> 00:05:47.735]  Get Turbo Force now!
[00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:03.740]  Big Brother.
[00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:05.962]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:07.043 --> 00:06:08.164]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:08.825 --> 00:06:10.266]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:10.887 --> 00:06:12.228]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:13.049 --> 00:06:17.813]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:20.055 --> 00:06:21.717]  It's Monday, February 19th, 2024.
[00:06:24.511 --> 00:06:25.751]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:28.132]  So thankful that you all decided to join us today.
[00:06:28.172 --> 00:06:35.994]  We're 259 days, 12 hours, 53 minutes, 40 seconds out for the most important election in world history.
[00:06:37.694 --> 00:06:41.335]  And we are live, on air, in defiance of the globalists.
[00:06:41.795 --> 00:06:45.256]  Reaching more people than ever thanks to all of your actions.
[00:06:45.696 --> 00:06:47.236]  Spreading the word about the broadcast.
[00:06:48.036 --> 00:06:49.157]  Supporting the broadcast.
[00:06:49.757 --> 00:06:50.957]  And praying for the broadcast.
[00:06:52.992 --> 00:06:53.292]  All right.
[00:06:53.773 --> 00:06:54.153]  Wow.
[00:06:54.533 --> 00:06:56.294]  As usual, total information overload.
[00:06:56.435 --> 00:06:57.335]  Absolutely insane.
[00:06:58.016 --> 00:07:10.004]  Over-the-top incredible developments in the Ukraine war, and Congress refusing to put forward the funding, and now the Ukrainian NATO forces in full retreat.
[00:07:10.105 --> 00:07:12.246]  We've got that stack of news.
[00:07:13.867 --> 00:07:15.729]  We also have the huge trucker
[00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:17.618]  We're good to go.
[00:07:27.455 --> 00:07:31.859]  Truckers are saying they're not going to deliver food or anything else to New York for years.
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:39.206]  And the vast majority of them are linking up and doing it, not through some union, but through a human union of common sense and common defense.
[00:07:39.866 --> 00:07:45.472]  And it is going to absolutely further devastate the globalist hellhole that is New York City.
[00:07:45.492 --> 00:07:52.078]  We're going to be talking about that and how it's a model of peaceful civil disobedient action that can be duplicated across the board.
[00:07:53.609 --> 00:07:59.732]  The evil Governor Hochul went on radio and said, don't worry the businesses.
[00:08:01.793 --> 00:08:03.894]  We only did this to politically hurt Donald Trump.
[00:08:03.934 --> 00:08:05.294]  We won't do this to you.
[00:08:05.514 --> 00:08:06.295]  Yeah, right.
[00:08:06.875 --> 00:08:11.837]  Clean up on Isle Ingergon.
[00:08:12.297 --> 00:08:18.440]  Hochul attempts to reassure New York businesses they won't suffer Trump's legal fate.
[00:08:19.835 --> 00:08:23.918]  Obscene award against Trump is testing the New York legal system's integrity.
[00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:24.518]  Daily Mail.
[00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:26.439]  Does anyone believe this?
[00:08:26.499 --> 00:08:33.204]  New York governor tells businesses they have nothing to fear after Democrat state leaders fleeced Donald Trump for $355 million.
[00:08:33.704 --> 00:08:37.287]  They're talking about another $100 million or $95 million in interest payments.
[00:08:37.307 --> 00:08:38.287]  That's $450 million.
[00:08:38.307 --> 00:08:38.487]  Mm-mm-mm.
[00:08:42.432 --> 00:08:42.972]  We're good to go.
[00:09:11.291 --> 00:09:20.058]  Where she said one reason she was banning me off YouTube was because her 15-year-old son wouldn't stop watching Alex Jones.
[00:09:21.359 --> 00:09:28.885]  Well, he obviously wasn't listening to me enough, but he was a listener, he was a fan, according to her, and now he's dead at 19.
[00:09:28.925 --> 00:09:34.350]  These globalists think they're immune from their own system.
[00:09:36.004 --> 00:09:36.544]  They're not.
[00:09:36.764 --> 00:09:41.765]  He ingested a drug former YouTube CEO's son found dead in a UC Berkeley dorm.
[00:09:42.645 --> 00:09:43.245]  Very sad.
[00:09:44.286 --> 00:09:46.166]  My son won't quit watching Alex Jones.
[00:09:46.246 --> 00:09:46.726]  It's terrible.
[00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:49.667]  I have to debate him about Alex Jones being bad.
[00:09:50.187 --> 00:09:52.987]  That's why I'm happily banning Alex Jones.
[00:09:53.687 --> 00:09:56.268]  So my son and other children and young people can't see him.
[00:09:56.648 --> 00:09:58.328]  That's basically word for word what she said.
[00:09:58.348 --> 00:09:59.308]  We can dig the clips up.
[00:10:00.009 --> 00:10:01.989]  But very, very sad.
[00:10:03.593 --> 00:10:06.335]  CIA had foreign allies spy on Trump.
[00:10:06.415 --> 00:10:09.677]  There's more documents coming out on that front.
[00:10:09.697 --> 00:10:17.181]  80% of Americans test positive for chemical found in Cheerios and Quaker Oats that is linked to infertility and gender bending.
[00:10:17.201 --> 00:10:22.104]  We're going to be looking at all of that critical information.
[00:10:22.724 --> 00:10:28.648]  Also, New York PD mocked after unveiling overweight female dance team as crime soars.
[00:10:30.834 --> 00:10:35.597]  National Health Service comes out in the UK and says, Trans milk as good as real thing.
[00:10:37.418 --> 00:10:40.099]  Absolute cuckoo for cuckoo puffs.
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:41.720]  Land.
[00:10:43.281 --> 00:10:44.561]  And so much more.
[00:10:44.722 --> 00:10:59.790]  Now, the big deep dive, and I'm going to drill into all this in a moment, that we'll be doing in the second and third hour today, is I'm having a bunch of embalmers and undertakers, funeral home operators, come on.
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:13.723]  I have three stacks of studies and science and J&J and AstraZeneca and Pfizer and Moderna admitting their injections cause these synthetic, giant blood clots.
[00:11:15.063 --> 00:11:17.204]  These big, rubbery, horrible, tuberous things.
[00:11:17.724 --> 00:11:23.225]  And we'll be going over all that, but there's nothing like going to the source.
[00:11:26.086 --> 00:11:29.307]  If you're watching on TV, this is a giant clot taken out of a deceased man.
[00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:31.800]  We're good to go.
[00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:01.691]  We're good to go.
[00:12:30.319 --> 00:12:30.779]  We're good to go.
[00:12:59.195 --> 00:13:02.296]  They tested all this on rodents.
[00:13:29.497 --> 00:13:35.680]  And that's exactly what they found in the studies at the University of Texas Galveston and University of North Carolina Chapel Hill.
[00:13:36.361 --> 00:13:40.723]  I've shown you new scientist headlines before COVID about this.
[00:13:41.524 --> 00:13:45.566]  And UT said this should never be tested on humans.
[00:13:46.467 --> 00:13:49.969]  It cut the life expectancy of mice and rats in half.
[00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:52.450]  And guess how they died?
[00:13:54.051 --> 00:13:55.692]  Giant blood clots.
[00:13:59.028 --> 00:14:03.330]  Oh, and the shots attack the testicles and ovaries of the mice and rats.
[00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:08.952]  So, ladies and gentlemen, this was all developed as a weapon.
[00:14:11.273 --> 00:14:14.634]  And the so-called virus does create a little bit of this in the body.
[00:14:15.714 --> 00:14:20.416]  But in all the studies, it is the shots that order your body to create the spike protein in mass.
[00:14:21.735 --> 00:14:21.955]  I think?
[00:14:21.975 --> 00:14:22.155]  I think?
[00:14:49.022 --> 00:14:49.463]  We're good to go.
[00:14:49.483 --> 00:14:49.643]  I think?
[00:15:10.742 --> 00:15:15.024]  The oncologists are reporting from cancer just absolute turbocharging.
[00:15:15.084 --> 00:15:17.765]  The word they use, turbo cancer.
[00:15:18.925 --> 00:15:20.926]  So, welcome to the New World Order.
[00:15:23.447 --> 00:15:36.153]  Now, these are the clots, your TV viewer, in the bottles that the embalmers in Australia and Germany and France and Ireland and Scotland and England and Canada and the U.S.
[00:15:36.233 --> 00:15:39.054]  and wherever you take the shots...
[00:15:40.725 --> 00:15:44.387]  It doesn't matter if it was Virus Vector, J&J, AstraZeneca.
[00:15:44.407 --> 00:15:45.708]  It doesn't matter if it was mRNA.
[00:15:46.168 --> 00:15:52.692]  Because the order from the Pentagon of the vaccine makers was, make something that does this.
[00:15:55.474 --> 00:15:56.995]  And they gave them the specs.
[00:15:58.536 --> 00:16:10.580]  The only difference is the J&J and AstraZeneca fire a live virus in with another virus in it through your cell membrane and order the cell to create the spike proteins.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:17.922]  But with a mRNA, it goes to the surface of the cell and then programs it to do it.
[00:16:18.802 --> 00:16:19.863]  But it does the same damn thing.
[00:16:20.443 --> 00:16:25.304]  So it's like if I shot you in the head with a 12-gauge shotgun or a .50 caliber rifle or a .357 Magnum,
[00:16:27.919 --> 00:16:31.802]  Or a .40 caliber, it's still not going to feel good.
[00:16:32.963 --> 00:16:33.824]  It all does the same thing.
[00:16:33.884 --> 00:16:37.947]  Different guns, but shooting the spike protein bullet in there.
[00:16:38.787 --> 00:16:41.570]  And then you have the nanolibid particles that are all mixed with it.
[00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:51.237]  Those go all over the body and embed everywhere and help the viral payload survive, is the way scientists describe it.
[00:16:52.618 --> 00:16:52.798]  So...
[00:16:54.361 --> 00:16:58.263]  All I can tell you is, ladies and gentlemen, is this is just horrible.
[00:16:58.403 --> 00:17:00.784]  And we're now three years into this nightmare.
[00:17:02.004 --> 00:17:10.928]  And the UN is up there saying, Tedros, the head of the WHO, you better pass my pandemic tree that takes full control of your country and your borders and your bodies.
[00:17:12.088 --> 00:17:15.230]  Because disease X, Y, and Z are coming.
[00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:18.431]  And they're going to be worse.
[00:17:22.372 --> 00:17:24.674]  What nice people they are.
[00:17:27.295 --> 00:17:29.877]  So we've got all of that information.
[00:17:33.439 --> 00:17:48.309]  So ahead of me having these folks with the rubber meets the road that are slicing open the bodies, again, thousands of coroners and pathologists and embalmers and undertakers
[00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:54.038]  They're all saying the same thing, and I've got four stacks of studies.
[00:17:56.879 --> 00:18:01.822]  But there's nothing like an actual witness to it that posts the videos.
[00:18:03.723 --> 00:18:05.765]  Here, this 47-year-old man died.
[00:18:05.925 --> 00:18:06.705]  He's in good shape.
[00:18:06.725 --> 00:18:07.566]  He's a marathon runner.
[00:18:08.359 --> 00:18:09.280]  Let's see what's in him.
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:15.865]  And every damn artery and vein has got big, long, giant, plasticky tubes in them.
[00:18:16.165 --> 00:18:26.474]  And they've never seen one in all their years until the switch got flipped in early 2021 and let the death begin.
[00:18:26.494 --> 00:18:37.183]  Imagine being somebody that works for the establishment and feels safe being part of this.
[00:18:38.524 --> 00:18:44.889]  But see, they've committed a crime so massive, they believe the public won't be able to handle or deal with it.
[00:18:45.549 --> 00:18:51.373]  How do you think the globalists and the pedo cult took over the Catholic Church and the Boy Scouts and it seems like every other institution?
[00:18:52.414 --> 00:18:53.815]  They get a pedo raping kids.
[00:18:54.235 --> 00:18:55.096]  It gets embarrassing.
[00:18:55.136 --> 00:18:57.698]  The church sends the pedo to another state.
[00:18:58.888 --> 00:18:59.509]  We're good to go.
[00:19:21.445 --> 00:19:32.595]  Once they get a hospital to take the 53,000 to put some on a ventilator or to cut off therapeutics that help them and to follow the global protocol, they've now been corrupted.
[00:19:32.635 --> 00:19:45.206]  And so you see the reports everywhere of doctors and nurses and hospitals covering up the mass death numbers, trying to cover up the blood clots and the myocarditis and the strokes because they were a party to it.
[00:19:46.431 --> 00:19:58.561]  And at first, most of them didn't know, but see, now, to CYA, they have been part of it, so now they're guilty, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:01.483 --> 00:20:03.445]  Now they're consciously parties to it.
[00:20:04.545 --> 00:20:13.372]  And then you get the head statistician, three, four months ago, comes out in New Zealand, who had the national computer
[00:20:14.209 --> 00:20:14.609]  We're good to go.
[00:20:14.629 --> 00:20:15.069]  We're good to go.
[00:20:45.066 --> 00:20:55.890]  Now, we could see when booster programs and things rolled out in other countries and see it spike as well, but he had the actual database where it overlaid deceased, deceased, deceased.
[00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:59.311]  We could just see the raw numbers of death when the shots start.
[00:20:59.771 --> 00:21:04.193]  He could specifically, and he released it, and we showed it here, go in and show
[00:21:05.526 --> 00:21:08.088]  That it was specifically people that took the shot.
[00:21:08.468 --> 00:21:15.894]  Not magically extra car wrecks or a war or something that wasn't happening, but specifically it was the injected.
[00:21:20.238 --> 00:21:24.921]  Unbelievably premeditated, incredibly evil.
[00:21:26.082 --> 00:21:32.427]  So people ask how I'm doing all the time, all the attacks, the things we go through and the rest of it, and I say, I mean, I'm doing absolutely terrible.
[00:21:33.288 --> 00:21:34.529]  I mean, I'm in the same boat as you.
[00:21:35.683 --> 00:21:40.886]  They want me off the air folks because they don't want this discussed because it's a sick cult.
[00:21:43.408 --> 00:21:48.931]  And they actually believe that when they kill most of us they're going to have more material.
[00:21:48.991 --> 00:21:50.972]  It's a zero-sum game.
[00:21:53.442 --> 00:21:55.964]  And Elon Musk has explained to them the actuaries, the numbers.
[00:21:56.485 --> 00:21:59.508]  You start cutting population, things implode.
[00:21:59.608 --> 00:22:05.574]  It's big populations that create all this diversity of businesses and industry and systems.
[00:22:07.175 --> 00:22:14.883]  That's why they're now paying people $70,000 plus per child in South Korea because they're only having 1.1 children per couple.
[00:22:17.065 --> 00:22:17.666]  They're dying.
[00:22:18.911 --> 00:22:20.872]  China is now saying, oh, have three kids.
[00:22:21.653 --> 00:22:23.894]  Just five years ago, they'd kill your second kid.
[00:22:25.175 --> 00:22:26.556]  Because it doesn't work.
[00:22:26.636 --> 00:22:28.377]  It's a collapsed civilization.
[00:22:30.678 --> 00:22:34.400]  And this globalist program, ladies and gentlemen, is not going to work.
[00:22:35.461 --> 00:22:39.804]  But still, they go ahead with the operation.
[00:22:42.165 --> 00:22:42.485]  All right.
[00:22:43.726 --> 00:22:45.707]  I have a lot of other news I want to hit.
[00:22:46.868 --> 00:22:48.189]  And I want to drill into here.
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.021]  There is so much of it here today.
[00:22:51.941 --> 00:22:57.023]  But let's go ahead, since I'm talking about this, give you a little prelude to what's coming up next.
[00:23:01.025 --> 00:23:09.688]  Let's play clip two of Richard Hirschman removing one of the strange white fibrous clots from the right jugular vein of a dead man.
[00:23:12.129 --> 00:23:16.751]  And then let's air clip one, former Air Force Major Thomas Haviland
[00:23:17.765 --> 00:23:22.408]  Find 70% of embalmers report seeing strange blood clots beginning in 2021.
[00:23:22.608 --> 00:23:31.633]  And then I've got another big funeral home director in the UK who they've censored off the internet.
[00:23:32.694 --> 00:23:36.096]  He talks about the miscarriages.
[00:23:38.578 --> 00:23:41.820]  In fact, let's start with six and then go to two.
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:47.223]  Funeral director John O'Looney's message to the doctors and nurses today
[00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:49.491]  They're going to hand them.
[00:23:49.531 --> 00:23:50.752]  Your ass is on a plate.
[00:23:51.673 --> 00:23:58.279]  And then he also gets into the massive... Yeah, let's do this.
[00:23:59.481 --> 00:24:03.605]  Let's play clips of John O'Looney, because they're trying to censor him first.
[00:24:04.766 --> 00:24:10.471]  Play clip five, and then play clip six.
[00:24:11.693 --> 00:24:12.834]  And then we'll come back to the other clips.
[00:24:12.874 --> 00:24:13.114]  Go ahead.
[00:24:15.811 --> 00:24:19.212]  ...developments regarding baby deaths and baby funerals.
[00:24:19.972 --> 00:24:26.793]  So if you go to the UK government website, Northampton NHS in detail mentioning children's funerals.
[00:24:27.674 --> 00:24:29.074]  We've never known this happened before.
[00:24:29.474 --> 00:24:31.274]  There's a contract up for tender.
[00:24:31.474 --> 00:24:32.895]  There's another one for Hertfordshire.
[00:24:33.175 --> 00:24:37.676]  There's another one for Hertfordshire, specifically baby funerals, that's been awarded.
[00:24:38.056 --> 00:24:41.236]  Maidstone and Trumbage Wells, NHS contract awarded.
[00:24:41.256 --> 00:24:43.577]  Leicester Hospitals, NHS awarded.
[00:24:44.157 --> 00:24:50.986]  So, contractfinderservice.gov.uk, notice, and then look for children's and babies' funerals.
[00:24:51.546 --> 00:24:57.493]  Anyway, WNHS is another one for those who do not want to have Mexican arranged funerals.
[00:24:58.074 --> 00:24:59.936]  They'll do that for you now.
[00:25:00.817 --> 00:25:01.979]  There is a doctor.
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:06.022]  In Australia called Dr. Luke McClendon.
[00:25:06.402 --> 00:25:16.489]  He leads the fertility services at the Mater Hospital and is the principal investigator for a series of randomized controlled trials.
[00:25:16.929 --> 00:25:22.113]  He's also the president of the Australian Institute for Asthorative Reproductive Medicine.
[00:25:22.513 --> 00:25:25.235]  He's the top doctor in Australia in this field and he has been sacked.
[00:25:26.209 --> 00:25:27.831]  Now, why has he been sacked?
[00:25:27.871 --> 00:25:34.077]  He got sacked on Friday for not getting a jab and for trying to release his data on miscarriages post the jab.
[00:25:34.477 --> 00:25:41.604]  He has until next Friday to get out of his private practice rooms as he is no longer allowed to practice, either in public or in private.
[00:25:42.325 --> 00:25:53.254]  He told me that he has been investigating miscarriages in couples post-vaccination and he said that normal miscarriage rate is between 5 and maybe as high as 16%.
[00:25:53.694 --> 00:26:03.222]  But he's since been keeping stats since the introduction of the vaccine and he's found that 74% of women who are vaccinated are now having miscarriages.
[00:26:04.343 --> 00:26:05.204]  Let me say this again.
[00:26:05.224 --> 00:26:10.628]  74% of women are having miscarriages who are vaccinated.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:26.383]  So this would explain totally why these hospitals now want to deal directly with crematoria and that vans are taking multiple babies directly to the crematorium, bypassing funeral directors.
[00:26:27.603 --> 00:26:29.044]  I did say I told you so.
[00:26:29.064 --> 00:26:30.024]  I told you so.
[00:26:30.924 --> 00:26:32.204]  Get looking into it, guys.
[00:26:32.304 --> 00:26:33.064]  Get looking into it.
[00:26:33.124 --> 00:26:40.166]  Wake people up because there are more babies dying now than ever and the only thing they have in common is their mums were vaccinated.
[00:26:41.368 --> 00:26:42.128]  This is dread.
[00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:43.709]  Absolutely dreadful.
[00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:46.211]  Good morning, guys.
[00:26:46.891 --> 00:26:56.137]  February the 13th, 2024, and I listened with interest to the live interview of Rishi Sunak doing a question time on GB News.
[00:26:56.857 --> 00:27:08.143]  And it was very interesting to hear him say that all the politicians did was follow doctor's instructions, so clearly they're about to hand the doctors their arse on a plate.
[00:27:09.444 --> 00:27:11.406]  Now, you doctors know what's happened.
[00:27:11.606 --> 00:27:17.973]  I've spoke to you in my funeral home and you've openly admitted you know what's happened and you've known for some time.
[00:27:18.614 --> 00:27:24.220]  Rishi Sunak has openly declared there who he's going to blame, who he's pointing the finger at.
[00:27:25.799 --> 00:27:31.963]  So with this in mind, I suggest that you all think very carefully about righting this wrong.
[00:27:32.463 --> 00:27:34.424]  It's not too late to redeem yourself.
[00:27:35.164 --> 00:27:45.390]  Making a pact between you and coming out openly and telling the truth about what happened and what continues to happen with these poisons.
[00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:48.712]  They recommend still as safe and effective.
[00:27:49.393 --> 00:27:55.016]  Rishi Sunak's about to throw you on the bonfire, guys, so that you face the public wrath.
[00:27:57.039 --> 00:27:58.020]  We're good to go.
[00:28:06.991 --> 00:28:09.773]  Doctors, you need to speak out and the time is short.
[00:28:10.073 --> 00:28:14.616]  They're going to usher the who in shortly and then it's going to be too late to say anything.
[00:28:15.456 --> 00:28:22.521]  I suggest you use that intellect that you have to process very carefully what's going to happen in the coming days.
[00:28:23.021 --> 00:28:27.964]  Two doctors, now Rishi Sunak has openly blamed you for injuries and deaths.
[00:28:28.805 --> 00:28:30.066]  You need to speak out, guys.
[00:28:30.086 --> 00:28:33.488]  Your window of opportunity is growing smaller and smaller.
[00:28:34.588 --> 00:28:35.028]  We're good to go.
[00:29:00.552 --> 00:29:05.960]  In 60 seconds, I don't have time to tell you about all the incredible ingredients in Turbo Force.
[00:29:06.381 --> 00:29:16.376]  If you simply go to InfoWarsStore.com and look at the list of ingredients and look them up, every one of them is known to give you boosted, clean, focused energy without the letdown.
[00:29:16.636 --> 00:29:17.356]  We're good to go.
[00:29:38.161 --> 00:29:45.043]  Get Turbo Force today at InfoWarsStore.com and I know you will not be disappointed because thousands of others have gotten it and it has five-star reviews.
[00:29:45.063 --> 00:29:46.404]  Get Turbo Force now!
[00:29:59.158 --> 00:30:00.999]  But folks, we're standing up for our rights.
[00:30:01.039 --> 00:30:02.119]  We're standing up for your rights.
[00:30:02.139 --> 00:30:04.540]  We're standing up for all of our freedoms and our children.
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:12.402]  If you don't spread the word about the broadcast, if you don't share the links, if you don't buy products at InfoWarsStore.com, then I'm not bribing at you.
[00:30:12.422 --> 00:30:13.522]  I'm just saying, what are you doing?
[00:30:14.603 --> 00:30:17.884]  Less than 1% of you ever buy a product at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:30:18.792 --> 00:30:25.777]  If just a half a percent more would go buy a book or a film or a t-shirt or get some of our great supplements and then reorder them because they really work.
[00:30:26.118 --> 00:30:26.678]  Just try it.
[00:30:27.319 --> 00:30:29.240]  We would be able to do so many things.
[00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:33.383]  I'm praying to God that he'll touch your heart to decide to support us.
[00:30:33.924 --> 00:30:35.665]  Infowarsstore.com
[00:30:37.807 --> 00:30:38.468]  It's been sold out.
[00:30:38.508 --> 00:30:39.308]  It's back in stock.
[00:30:39.368 --> 00:30:40.549]  Reformulated even stronger.
[00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:43.211]  Nitric boost to clean out your blood and your whole body.
[00:30:43.672 --> 00:30:44.753]  Vasodilation.
[00:30:44.773 --> 00:30:47.155]  It's got a lot of wonderful side effects.
[00:30:47.175 --> 00:30:47.695]  And I mean good ones.
[00:30:47.755 --> 00:30:49.016]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:30:49.637 --> 00:30:50.538]  It is powerful.
[00:30:50.578 --> 00:30:51.518]  So be careful with it.
[00:30:51.859 --> 00:30:53.000]  Next level foundational energy.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.782]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:00.081]  I'm not perfect.
[00:31:00.101 --> 00:31:00.901]  I'm under a lot of stress.
[00:31:00.921 --> 00:31:05.144]  But if I didn't have the supplements we have, we promote, I wouldn't be able to continue to be on air.
[00:31:05.725 --> 00:31:13.871]  And when you go to InfoWarsStore.com, you are funding the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists in an operation that the enemy admits has been the most effective at exposing them.
[00:31:14.151 --> 00:31:15.673]  Because we're fearless and we don't back down.
[00:31:16.013 --> 00:31:17.034]  We got God on our side.
[00:31:17.294 --> 00:31:18.815]  But God needs to work through you.
[00:31:19.155 --> 00:31:23.158]  You've got to make the decision to get great products you already need at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:23.218 --> 00:31:24.459]  And that is a 360 win.
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:29.343]  Nitric Boost, without me even knowing, became our number three best seller because people
[00:31:29.403 --> 00:31:30.023]  We're good to go.
[00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:03.492]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:32:03.512 --> 00:32:05.052]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:32:05.813 --> 00:32:08.854]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:32:09.755 --> 00:32:17.859]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:32:18.679 --> 00:32:26.483]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:32:27.503 --> 00:32:30.365]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:32:30.385 --> 00:32:36.130]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:32:36.931 --> 00:32:37.852]  I know you spread the word.
[00:32:37.872 --> 00:32:39.353]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[00:32:39.393 --> 00:32:39.933]  Keep doing it.
[00:32:39.973 --> 00:32:48.260]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:32:48.921 --> 00:32:52.304]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:32:53.165 --> 00:32:57.812]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Enforcement.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:32:58.152 --> 00:32:58.993]  Please take action now.
[00:33:01.637 --> 00:33:07.546]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:20.271 --> 00:33:27.737]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:27.757 --> 00:33:33.402]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:55.353 --> 00:34:02.156]  Ladies and gentlemen, what we're seeing is a complete takeover, not just of the Internet of Things, not just the world, but our bodies.
[00:34:03.797 --> 00:34:05.137]  And I want to get more into this in a moment.
[00:34:05.157 --> 00:34:06.558]  I also want to hit the big Russian news.
[00:34:07.318 --> 00:34:09.820]  Because suddenly they're saying, okay, Ukraine's being totally defeated.
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:12.181]  We've got to get in the war officially.
[00:34:12.601 --> 00:34:16.743]  They're claiming Russia's got secret space weapons, which of course they do, and so does the United States.
[00:34:17.743 --> 00:34:20.464]  They're claiming that Putin's got to be taken out.
[00:34:21.145 --> 00:34:23.806]  They've got all these former and current generals calling for total war.
[00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:27.532]  And they got a big Washington Post, which is the CIA article.
[00:34:28.073 --> 00:34:35.582]  Vladimir Putin riding high before the death of the political dissident says now he may be unstoppable.
[00:34:35.602 --> 00:34:40.588]  And when you read the article, it really tells you what they're thinking and what they're up to.
[00:34:41.567 --> 00:34:47.512]  But first, let me just remind listeners, we're listener and viewer supported, and we have amazing products that will enrich your life and empower you.
[00:34:48.092 --> 00:34:52.255]  Just like what we cover is game-changing on air, our products are the very best out there.
[00:34:52.636 --> 00:34:56.859]  And one of those is Turbo Force, discounted at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:34:57.359 --> 00:35:09.789]  This is the cleanest, highest quality ingredients that are time-released to give you clean, focused, without the crash, energy, with a whole bunch of very high-quality products
[00:35:09.969 --> 00:35:11.630]  Also, you've heard Dr. Judy Mikovits.
[00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:28.450]  We're good to go.
[00:35:50.916 --> 00:35:52.916]  We went right to actually supplying our supplier.
[00:35:53.357 --> 00:35:55.117]  So we're able to offer it not at 25%.
[00:35:56.037 --> 00:36:00.598]  The last year, two years, it's only been 25% off as its best sale.
[00:36:00.978 --> 00:36:03.579]  It's 40% off on Nitric Boost.
[00:36:03.779 --> 00:36:06.739]  Everyone, men, women, and children should be taking this.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.840]  It has a lot of great side effects.
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.120]  I'm just going to tell men that.
[00:36:12.441 --> 00:36:18.642]  And you'll notice what I'm talking about when you take it in the... You'll notice in the morning when you wake up.
[00:36:18.722 --> 00:36:19.182]  You know what I mean?
[00:36:20.267 --> 00:36:21.287]  And that's a side effect.
[00:36:21.627 --> 00:36:22.968]  That's what it's doing to your blood, folks.
[00:36:23.008 --> 00:36:23.948]  It's opening things up.
[00:36:24.548 --> 00:36:26.229]  Nitric Boost is incredible.
[00:36:26.669 --> 00:36:28.869]  All you've got to do is try it, and you'll reorder it.
[00:36:29.789 --> 00:36:30.570]  You can't lose.
[00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:35.171]  Because if it was placebo, which it's not, you're supporting the broadcast.
[00:36:35.411 --> 00:36:36.531]  We're doing great things here on air.
[00:36:36.751 --> 00:36:37.711]  We're fighting the New World Order.
[00:36:37.952 --> 00:36:38.552]  But it's not.
[00:36:38.932 --> 00:36:44.633]  It's a whole bunch of natural concentrated known compounds that flush out and clean out your blood and your organs.
[00:36:45.273 --> 00:36:47.134]  Your liver, your heart, your brain, everything.
[00:36:48.171 --> 00:36:48.831]  Nitric Boost.
[00:36:48.951 --> 00:36:50.532]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:36:51.612 --> 00:36:53.932]  And it's almost sold out.
[00:36:55.893 --> 00:36:57.833]  We also have Next Level Foundational Energy.
[00:36:58.194 --> 00:37:00.654]  That isn't a stimulant, but does the same thing naturally.
[00:37:01.394 --> 00:37:02.295]  Methylfolate.
[00:37:02.335 --> 00:37:03.915]  The breakdown of folic acid.
[00:37:04.835 --> 00:37:06.196]  Remember Popeye's Strong to the Finish?
[00:37:06.236 --> 00:37:06.916]  He eats a spinach?
[00:37:07.336 --> 00:37:08.196]  That's folic acid.
[00:37:08.216 --> 00:37:11.617]  But a lot of people can't break down folic acid completely.
[00:37:12.762 --> 00:37:20.203]  This is broken down folic acid with a bunch of other key ingredients that are known in the cells, like a B-complex, to supercharge it.
[00:37:20.263 --> 00:37:22.724]  Get Next Level Foundational Energy, the first run of it.
[00:37:22.764 --> 00:37:28.185]  It's already a big hit at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:37:28.205 --> 00:37:32.906]  And then finally, my dad's a big sponsor of the show.
[00:37:33.226 --> 00:37:36.327]  He has his own warehouse, his own shipping department here in Austin, Texas.
[00:37:36.367 --> 00:37:38.027]  He does a great job, and he's got...
[00:37:39.187 --> 00:37:40.828]  With the tea tree, with the...
[00:38:04.352 --> 00:38:06.454]  Nano silver with the iodine.
[00:38:06.474 --> 00:38:07.855]  I mean, the kitchen sink is in this.
[00:38:07.936 --> 00:38:08.516]  No fillers.
[00:38:08.596 --> 00:38:10.278]  It lasts twice as long as regular toothpaste.
[00:38:10.818 --> 00:38:11.939]  A tiny little bead of it.
[00:38:12.898 --> 00:38:13.218]  I think.
[00:38:13.238 --> 00:38:13.478]  I think.
[00:38:42.259 --> 00:38:47.702]  It's all there at drjonesnaturals.com, drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:38:49.323 --> 00:38:53.305]  You owe it to yourself to check out these products, and it funds the InfoWar, a total 360 win.
[00:38:53.385 --> 00:38:58.168]  And some of the products available at infowarstore.com are also available there, and some of the products available there are available here.
[00:38:58.608 --> 00:39:06.492]  But there's at least 14 products not available at infowarstore.com that are available exclusively at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:39:06.813 --> 00:39:08.073]  Believe me, he's good people.
[00:39:08.133 --> 00:39:08.654]  He's my daddy.
[00:39:08.674 --> 00:39:09.934]  You need to go there.
[00:39:10.135 --> 00:39:10.755]  Thank you so much.
[00:39:12.383 --> 00:39:12.683]  Alright.
[00:39:14.123 --> 00:39:21.845]  I want to hit the big Russia news, and then I want to hit the border news, and I want to hit the gangster crime wave news.
[00:39:24.506 --> 00:39:26.866]  And we're going to do that before we end the hour.
[00:39:27.986 --> 00:39:38.889]  But since we're teeing this up with all these funeral home directors and embalmers coming on with what they've witnessed and what they've seen, plus we have all the statistics proving they're right, but this is eyes on the ground.
[00:39:40.249 --> 00:39:40.709]  You can have a
[00:39:42.199 --> 00:39:42.999]  We're good to go.
[00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:02.671]  What are these weird, self-assembling...
[00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:28.952]  That's what color platelets are.
[00:40:28.992 --> 00:40:29.072]  Okay?
[00:40:36.454 --> 00:40:37.375]  Everybody knows that.
[00:40:37.755 --> 00:40:40.436]  Blood's red, folks, when it hits oxygen.
[00:40:40.896 --> 00:40:42.757]  So why is it clear white?
[00:40:43.158 --> 00:40:44.678]  Because it's completely artificial.
[00:40:45.299 --> 00:40:46.600]  And it's assembling in the body.
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:58.326]  They've had top scientists and medical doctors come out with all these research groups for three years that have put blood in a Petri dish and then put the Pfizer shot or the Moderna shot in and watched it create...
[00:40:59.301 --> 00:40:59.741]  We're good to go.
[00:40:59.762 --> 00:41:00.142]  We're good to go.
[00:41:23.669 --> 00:41:30.051]  The thousands of reports for the five plus years we were banned off everything but InfoWars.com and BannedOffVideo, which you can still find everything there.
[00:41:30.611 --> 00:41:31.591]  That's the heart of the rebellion.
[00:41:32.732 --> 00:41:41.094]  And I'm just thinking every day about this report, that report, this report, that report, that no one has seen other than this audience, which has four, five, ten million people.
[00:41:41.894 --> 00:41:44.055]  Full reach, 20 million or so tuned in here and there.
[00:41:44.295 --> 00:41:46.135]  But you know, it's two, three million every day tuned in.
[00:41:46.316 --> 00:41:47.176]  Let's not exaggerate.
[00:41:47.476 --> 00:41:50.997]  It actually tuned in a lesson before we got back on X. Now it's
[00:41:52.321 --> 00:41:54.063]  Let's not exaggerate, 20 million a day again.
[00:41:55.184 --> 00:41:57.986]  But that's hardcore listeners tuning in a few million.
[00:41:59.227 --> 00:42:01.209]  You're like the missionaries, though, or the ambassadors.
[00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:04.592]  Even when we were banned, we were reaching tens of millions a day with our clips.
[00:42:05.173 --> 00:42:12.099]  But now we're reaching 10 million a day, conservatively 15, 20 million a day, directly tuning in and getting a big chunk of the show.
[00:42:12.659 --> 00:42:13.720]  Really getting the deep dive.
[00:42:14.461 --> 00:42:16.423]  And I've had to say how many clips are being seen now.
[00:42:18.137 --> 00:42:18.977]  There's no way to know it.
[00:42:19.017 --> 00:42:20.278]  I mean, 50 million a day?
[00:42:21.098 --> 00:42:23.999]  So, because of your support, we're reaching a lot of people, so keep it up.
[00:42:24.359 --> 00:42:26.760]  You know who you are out there, and we appreciate you, and we salute you.
[00:42:28.041 --> 00:42:29.461]  Okay, so here's Greg Reese's report.
[00:42:29.881 --> 00:42:43.386]  Hydrogels in COVID vaccine are programmable human interface, and it turns out we have all the patents and all the studies like Moderna that was just created by Bill Gates and others a year before they released the virus.
[00:42:44.547 --> 00:42:46.388]  It's all part of a larger plan.
[00:42:47.108 --> 00:42:47.448]  Here it is.
[00:42:54.423 --> 00:43:04.293]  The following report is from Dr. Ana Maria Mealcia's recent article entitled Hydrogel Platform Enables Versatile Data Encryption and Decryption.
[00:43:05.074 --> 00:43:14.823]  The building blocks of hydrogels are being found in the COVID vaccine, and hydrogels are being found in the blood of both the vaccinated and the unvaccinated.
[00:43:15.504 --> 00:43:19.245]  They are the so-called blood clots that are being found around the world.
[00:43:19.765 --> 00:43:24.066]  And these hydrogels can now be programmed, encrypted, and decrypted.
[00:43:24.647 --> 00:43:39.991]  According to Mielcia, they are the substrate of the brain-computer interface and the primary method of fusing humans with machines, as she described by referencing MIT research in the article Hydrogel Interfaces for Merging Humans into Machines.
[00:43:40.831 --> 00:44:06.114]  Elements which Mielcia and Clifford Carnicom found with near-infrared spectroscopy in the blood of the unvaccinated exposed to shedding and environmental contamination include hydrogel plastics such as polyenes, vinyl, nylon, Kevlar, and spider silk proteins, as well as other nanotechnology signatures such as silicone and sulfur.
[00:44:06.795 --> 00:44:13.325]  This technology hijacks methyl groups, which are needed to detoxify and create glutathione in the body.
[00:44:13.966 --> 00:44:21.318]  Hydrogels used for the encrypted programmable technology include polyvinyl alcohol and polycaprolactone.
[00:44:22.139 --> 00:44:29.321]  Both of these hydrogels are listed as stealth nanoparticles in the Moderna patent for lipid nanoparticle composition.
[00:44:30.021 --> 00:44:42.324]  This suggests that not only those who received the shot have this hydrogel encryption technology in their bodies, but also those who have experienced shedding and environmental contamination, which is just about everyone.
[00:44:43.104 --> 00:44:46.626]  These hydrogels are known to be programmable and encrypted.
[00:44:46.987 --> 00:44:49.348]  This technology can behave as brain storage.
[00:44:49.788 --> 00:44:53.911]  It can store memories and visual information in an individual's brain.
[00:44:54.431 --> 00:45:03.777]  And it can be chemically induced to be securely encrypted and decrypted, allowing for the secure recording and storage of confidential visual information.
[00:45:04.197 --> 00:45:10.501]  This provides a platform for secure financial transactions, which is a requirement for a digital ID.
[00:45:11.662 --> 00:45:17.945]  MIT researchers have discussed how this very same technology can be used to fuse humans with machines.
[00:45:18.606 --> 00:45:31.232]  And while they've had problems working it out in the past, a recent paper has announced they've found success using the very same elements found in both the blood of the vaccinated and unvaccinated by Mielcia and Carnicom.
[00:45:31.972 --> 00:45:41.760]  In a lecture by Professor Sakharat Khizroev at the University of Miami, it is discussed how advanced materials can be used for interfacing machines and the human brain.
[00:45:42.301 --> 00:45:49.707]  He references a research project funded by DARPA, wherein magnetic nanoparticles are key to this technology.
[00:45:50.347 --> 00:45:57.553]  Mielcia has published research that shows how the COVID shots alter torsion fields in the body and produce magnetism.
[00:45:58.573 --> 00:46:02.936]  A review by the RAND Corporation, Brain Computer Interfaces, U.S.
[00:46:03.016 --> 00:46:09.040]  Military Applications and Implications, discuss the convergence of human with machine.
[00:46:10.001 --> 00:46:26.172]  In an interview with Big Pharma whistleblower Karen Kingston, Kingston discusses this self-assembly nanotechnology and how the spike protein is an engineered device triggered by electromagnetic frequency and how the quantum dots are gene editing technology.
[00:46:26.932 --> 00:46:27.593]  We're good to go.
[00:46:53.052 --> 00:47:01.874]  Mielcia has shown that the new protocols being sold to the public as a way of reversing the negative effect of the COVID shots have no effect on these hydrogels.
[00:47:02.454 --> 00:47:05.815]  And it would seem that well over a billion people are infected with them.
[00:47:06.615 --> 00:47:16.857]  While many are talking about an archaic implanted computer chip, it seems that the latest breakthrough technology has already been deployed without anyone's consent.
[00:47:17.597 --> 00:47:22.279]  The situation almost seems hopeless, but where there is a will, there is a way.
[00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:24.701]  And now is not the time to hide our heads.
[00:47:26.242 --> 00:47:30.144]  The human body is miraculous, and our potential is endless.
[00:47:30.664 --> 00:47:35.807]  The more people addressing this dire situation, the better chances we have of finding a remedy.
[00:47:36.727 --> 00:47:39.248]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:43.631]  An incredibly important report.
[00:47:45.652 --> 00:47:45.972]  Alright.
[00:47:47.426 --> 00:47:48.707]  I want to shift gears now.
[00:47:48.727 --> 00:47:55.773]  I want to shift gears now to crime.
[00:47:57.654 --> 00:47:59.976]  And this is something I'm focused on a little bit every day.
[00:48:01.557 --> 00:48:08.323]  Because all over the world, when they bring in illegal alien groups and others from third world nations and they commit crimes...
[00:48:09.921 --> 00:48:23.410]  The Soros fact, and it's the same in Europe, Soros funds it there as well, prosecutors will not prosecute, in almost any case, brown or black on white crime.
[00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:26.091]  And the FBI tries to cover up the statistics.
[00:48:26.411 --> 00:48:35.257]  We're not demonizing all the brown people, or even a large minority, but it's a fact that open season has been declared, and it's even been admitted.
[00:48:36.818 --> 00:48:38.119]  And you see the sentences.
[00:48:39.474 --> 00:48:44.777]  Somebody shoots dozens of people, they might get a year in jail if they're black.
[00:48:46.038 --> 00:48:49.800]  Now, if a white person does that, it's the end of the world.
[00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:54.583]  I don't care if it's a black person or a white person doing it.
[00:48:54.903 --> 00:48:55.924]  They should be prosecuted.
[00:48:56.184 --> 00:48:59.266]  And you've got white thugs, you've got black thugs, you've got Hispanic thugs.
[00:48:59.306 --> 00:49:00.006]  We all know that.
[00:49:00.627 --> 00:49:07.911]  But we saw the Kansas City Chiefs parade for the Super Bowl last week.
[00:49:09.668 --> 00:49:13.830]  And we heard on the news that two white males had shot 20-something people.
[00:49:15.611 --> 00:49:21.774]  And everybody went and looked at the video, people tackling folks, and it was brown people and white people tackling the folks that did it.
[00:49:22.115 --> 00:49:24.296]  And it was two gangs shooting at each other.
[00:49:26.297 --> 00:49:32.160]  And of course, they think it's a movie, so they just spray and pray, didn't hit who they were shooting at, but hit a bunch of innocent people.
[00:49:35.822 --> 00:49:35.922]  And
[00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:41.852]  Then the governor came out and said thugs did it.
[00:49:42.712 --> 00:49:44.892]  And they're suppressing the race.
[00:49:47.893 --> 00:49:58.977]  And the mayor of Kansas City, Quentin Lucas, came out on radio and on TV and had the police chief trot out there and say it's racism.
[00:50:00.918 --> 00:50:02.658]  And it's a dog whistle to say thugs.
[00:50:02.678 --> 00:50:04.139]  You know, Bonnie and Clyde were white.
[00:50:04.199 --> 00:50:04.859]  They were thugs.
[00:50:07.472 --> 00:50:09.995]  Charlie Manson was a psychotic thug.
[00:50:10.075 --> 00:50:10.535]  He was white.
[00:50:12.417 --> 00:50:16.341]  Jeffrey Dahmer was a psychotic person that tortured and ate people.
[00:50:16.421 --> 00:50:16.901]  He was white.
[00:50:17.362 --> 00:50:19.424]  He was a monster beyond a thug.
[00:50:21.351 --> 00:50:24.332]  So we need to call monsters monsters and call thugs thugs.
[00:50:25.193 --> 00:50:27.834]  And because of gangster rap, it's declassified.
[00:50:28.294 --> 00:50:29.915]  Ice Cube talked about it two weeks ago.
[00:50:30.355 --> 00:50:37.719]  The CIA came to them and said, we're going to boost your music, make it about killing cops and killing each other in the 1980s.
[00:50:37.839 --> 00:50:39.420]  And the CIA provided the crack.
[00:50:41.781 --> 00:50:47.684]  And now the same system and Soros wants to defund the police and give a green light to
[00:50:49.383 --> 00:50:49.943]  We're good to go.
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:24.845]  That literally have grown up fatherless, that think it's cool to run around shooting and killing people.
[00:51:26.026 --> 00:51:33.032]  And instead of admitting that and saying we've got to do something about it, why is the corporate media covering it up?
[00:51:33.193 --> 00:51:38.838]  I mean, you always know the color of somebody when they don't put their race on the news.
[00:51:40.979 --> 00:51:43.502]  And instead, they'll turn around and say it's a white person.
[00:51:44.497 --> 00:51:46.658]  So this is a larger plan to all get at each other's throats.
[00:51:47.118 --> 00:51:52.021]  I'm exposing it, not to put black people down, but to point out this larger agenda.
[00:51:52.541 --> 00:51:56.063]  Black people are the main victim of the young black gangbangers.
[00:51:56.163 --> 00:51:57.584]  And are there young white gangbangers?
[00:51:57.624 --> 00:51:57.904]  Yes.
[00:51:58.444 --> 00:51:59.665]  Are there Hispanic gangbangers?
[00:51:59.705 --> 00:51:59.965]  Yes.
[00:52:01.586 --> 00:52:03.687]  But they tend to kill their own kind.
[00:52:03.727 --> 00:52:04.527]  Look up the statistics.
[00:52:05.027 --> 00:52:06.188]  Whites tend to kill whites.
[00:52:06.848 --> 00:52:08.389]  Hispanics tend to kill Hispanics.
[00:52:08.729 --> 00:52:09.410]  That's who they know.
[00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:10.270]  It's who they're fighting with.
[00:52:11.531 --> 00:52:13.912]  And blacks still kill the majority of blacks, but...
[00:52:15.441 --> 00:52:28.852]  They're the one group statistically really getting out of the sandbox and the segregated killings going on and branching out to Hispanics and blacks and Asians, or whites, Hispanics, and Asians.
[00:52:29.913 --> 00:52:39.561]  So here's a clip of the Kansas City mayor bitching about the Missouri governor, Mike Parson, and there's another clip of him trotting out the female police chief.
[00:52:39.882 --> 00:52:41.923]  Nothing against female police chiefs, but that's all they do.
[00:52:41.943 --> 00:52:43.625]  It's like, oh, it's a woman, so it's okay, you know.
[00:52:45.258 --> 00:52:48.080]  And to sit there and try to cover all this up.
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:54.023]  So the point is, they said it was white people, and if they wouldn't have done that, I'd have just left it alone.
[00:52:55.003 --> 00:52:56.964]  But again, we're exposing the agenda.
[00:52:56.984 --> 00:52:59.685]  It's not about I'm trying to get the white team ahead of the other team.
[00:53:01.346 --> 00:53:04.828]  Ice Cube told you what I told you 25 years ago with Professor Griff.
[00:53:06.147 --> 00:53:07.668]  A public enemy, fan of the show.
[00:53:08.388 --> 00:53:15.991]  The CIA ran it, and I've sat there with top record executives and top rock and roll stars that told me all this decades ago.
[00:53:18.712 --> 00:53:22.034]  Dave Mustaine was in the meetings when they said, you better do gangster rap.
[00:53:22.054 --> 00:53:22.774]  He said, no way.
[00:53:23.174 --> 00:53:25.715]  So they delisted him.
[00:53:26.395 --> 00:53:27.576]  Billy Corgan told me about it.
[00:53:28.882 --> 00:53:29.783]  We're going to name some more names?
[00:53:30.683 --> 00:53:36.728]  I mean, and these weren't off-the-record meetings, but I'm not going to go further with another major household name rock star.
[00:53:36.968 --> 00:53:39.110]  Back when I, quite frankly, even had time to go out.
[00:53:40.111 --> 00:53:41.772]  I mean, I get calls from people all the time.
[00:53:42.472 --> 00:53:45.174]  Major heavy hitters say, hey, let's go out and have drinks and dinner.
[00:53:45.195 --> 00:53:46.075]  I go, nope, sorry.
[00:53:46.415 --> 00:53:47.016]  Stay with my family.
[00:53:47.837 --> 00:53:48.457]  They're like, wow.
[00:53:48.637 --> 00:53:50.779]  I'm just like, I just don't care about famous people.
[00:53:50.799 --> 00:53:54.141]  I like them as people because they're patriots, but I just don't do that anymore.
[00:53:54.161 --> 00:53:55.422]  But I used to run around with people.
[00:53:55.983 --> 00:53:57.024]  Some, you know, when they were in town.
[00:53:57.584 --> 00:53:58.525]  And one time I got taken...
[00:53:59.864 --> 00:54:00.204]  We're good to go.
[00:54:31.815 --> 00:54:34.557]  So, listen to this.
[00:54:35.478 --> 00:54:44.745]  And this is the mayor, after they said white people did it, and again, what's the agenda here?
[00:54:45.406 --> 00:54:47.528]  They don't want to clean up the thug stuff.
[00:54:47.968 --> 00:54:49.249]  They don't want to stop it, folks.
[00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:51.230]  Here's the clips.
[00:54:53.732 --> 00:54:55.434]  He's going to join us later on in this program.
[00:54:56.053 --> 00:55:01.498]  After the shooting, he said, we can't let some thugs and criminals just take over and ruin what happened.
[00:55:02.378 --> 00:55:05.020]  I gather that's not quite your assessment of what happened that day.
[00:55:07.863 --> 00:55:09.024]  I have respect for the governor.
[00:55:09.604 --> 00:55:10.485]  We get along well.
[00:55:11.005 --> 00:55:15.769]  I disagree strongly with how he would describe that situation.
[00:55:16.610 --> 00:55:18.912]  I certainly do think this was criminal activity.
[00:55:18.932 --> 00:55:21.974]  It was lawlessness, and I think that that's troubling.
[00:55:22.895 --> 00:55:25.557]  But thugs is a dog whistle.
[00:55:26.329 --> 00:55:27.911]  In the most classic sense.
[00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:29.772]  And I have seen this dog whistle time and again.
[00:55:29.792 --> 00:55:37.940]  There's this kind of giant conservative theory on social media now that the reason that monk shots haven't been shown is because the purported defendants are black.
[00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:40.222]  And if it were a white defendant, we would have just shown them.
[00:55:40.242 --> 00:55:42.063]  That is absolutely preposterous.
[00:55:42.303 --> 00:55:43.725]  There are protections to juveniles.
[00:55:44.325 --> 00:55:45.907]  Our city has a gun violence problem.
[00:55:46.948 --> 00:55:50.191]  That preliminary investigative findings have shown there was no nexus.
[00:55:51.448 --> 00:55:54.129]  To terrorism or homegrown violent extremism.
[00:55:54.969 --> 00:55:59.271]  This appeared to be a dispute between several people that ended in gunfire.
[00:56:00.551 --> 00:56:05.593]  During the overnight hours, we learned there are 23 victims of yesterday's shooting.
[00:56:06.974 --> 00:56:12.216]  One of our victims, Elizabeth Galvin, 43 years old, died.
[00:56:13.356 --> 00:56:17.077]  We are still learning about her, but know that she is beloved by many.
[00:56:17.958 --> 00:56:18.918]  To her friends and family,
[00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:26.030]  We are with you.
[00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:30.292]  And we are working tirelessly to investigate her murder.
[00:56:31.473 --> 00:56:37.236]  The 22 victims' age range between 8 years old and 47 years old.
[00:56:38.316 --> 00:56:41.678]  At least half of our victims are under the age of 16.
[00:56:41.818 --> 00:56:44.219]  Okay, so let's stop right there.
[00:56:44.239 --> 00:56:48.441]  And the point is, it was a black and Hispanic gang shooting it up with each other.
[00:56:50.502 --> 00:56:52.063]  And that's one of the people that got arrested.
[00:56:53.424 --> 00:56:54.845]  There's your white supremacist, folks.
[00:56:54.905 --> 00:57:00.689]  And all I'm saying is, why the hell would the media say that white people went and shot up the thing?
[00:57:00.709 --> 00:57:02.450]  Why didn't they just say that things got shot up?
[00:57:02.951 --> 00:57:08.855]  Because they want to demonize white people all day because the majority now in most areas is not white.
[00:57:09.155 --> 00:57:10.996]  The Democratic Party is playing racial politics.
[00:57:11.396 --> 00:57:14.959]  I'm exposing this because the Democratic Party is running racial politics like they always do.
[00:57:16.235 --> 00:57:23.237]  And if there were groups of white people going around targeting black people, I would call it out and I would expose it and I would say it's wrong.
[00:57:23.797 --> 00:57:24.817]  And it happens occasionally.
[00:57:25.237 --> 00:57:26.218]  You see it here and there.
[00:57:26.858 --> 00:57:30.199]  But the attacks on white people are epidemic.
[00:57:30.339 --> 00:57:31.159]  Everybody knows it.
[00:57:31.979 --> 00:57:33.039]  And it needs to stop.
[00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:42.182]  But I blame the Democratic Party and the Great Society and breaking up the black family...
[00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:47.132]  And the CIA and crack and gangster rap for all of it.
[00:58:04.642 --> 00:58:05.183]  We're good to go.
[00:58:31.303 --> 00:58:37.730]  At InfoWarsStore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:58:38.651 --> 00:58:43.736]  Bodies, 95% humanoid extract will absolutely blow you away.
[00:58:44.097 --> 00:58:45.118]  All you gotta do is try it.
[00:58:45.318 --> 00:58:45.939]  Get yours now.
[00:58:46.199 --> 00:58:47.601]  InfoWarsStore.com
[00:58:50.984 --> 00:58:52.245]  Gunther in Tennessee.
[00:58:52.285 --> 00:58:53.266]  Thanks for calling, Gunther.
[00:58:53.286 --> 00:58:53.847]  Hey, Alex.
[00:58:54.027 --> 00:58:54.788]  First time caller.
[00:58:54.868 --> 00:58:56.729]  Real quick, wanted to plug your foundational energy.
[00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:58.231]  Just started taking that.
[00:58:58.892 --> 00:59:03.216]  And, boy, three pills, the recommended dose, I was bouncing off the walls.
[00:59:03.336 --> 00:59:08.941]  But I tell you, foundational is the right name for that product because I've cut down to one.
[00:59:09.562 --> 00:59:13.826]  It's like you have a baseline of energy that you were missing before that you got back.
[00:59:13.946 --> 00:59:14.046]  So,
[00:59:14.206 --> 00:59:22.472]  Well, I'm glad you mentioned that because it's methylfolate, the breakdown of folic acid, and a lot of people, particularly Europeans, don't absorb all of the folic acid.
[00:59:22.712 --> 00:59:23.813]  So it's not a stimulant.
[00:59:24.033 --> 00:59:27.436]  It's a totally natural thing that boosts energy that's foundational.
[00:59:27.736 --> 00:59:30.298]  And was I lying to you or did it not work?
[00:59:30.978 --> 00:59:32.179]  No, it was top-notch.
[00:59:32.219 --> 00:59:35.842]  And I was actually taking Red Pill Plus before, and that's got a little folic acid in it.
[00:59:35.902 --> 00:59:39.684]  I think there was a little buildup from this, but the energy from this was no jitters.
[00:59:39.865 --> 00:59:40.805]  I mean, it's top-notch.
[00:59:40.825 --> 00:59:41.606]  It's a great product.
[00:59:42.028 --> 00:59:42.969]  Well, thank you so much.
[00:59:43.029 --> 00:59:46.772]  Yeah, no, folic acid's great and it's in real red pill, but some can't break it down.
[00:59:46.812 --> 00:59:47.792]  This is the breakdown of it.
[00:59:47.893 --> 00:59:48.673]  That's exactly it.
[00:59:51.215 --> 00:59:57.100]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:16.262]  Alright, we got big guests, funeral home directors, embalmers, undertakers joining us.
[01:00:16.302 --> 01:00:22.385]  We got all the statistics and numbers too about how much these poison shots are taking a lethal toll on the public.
[01:00:23.848 --> 01:00:26.429]  I don't want to finish up with what I was just covering at the end of the last hour.
[01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:28.670]  Here's a big story from Zero Hedge.
[01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:34.573]  Harvard professor says all hell broke loose when his study revealed no racial bias in police shootings.
[01:00:35.314 --> 01:00:37.455]  In fact, he was speaking at the University of Texas last week.
[01:00:37.855 --> 01:00:38.615]  He's from Harvard.
[01:00:38.815 --> 01:00:39.336]  He's black.
[01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:46.539]  He actually found that police shoot white people per capita more often than they shoot black people.
[01:00:49.341 --> 01:00:51.902]  So one-to-one, white people, black people...
[01:00:53.163 --> 01:00:58.267]  The police shoot white people more often than they shoot black people.
[01:01:00.188 --> 01:01:07.794]  Because the cops know, even if somebody's waving a gun around at them, if they shoot them, the Soros DA is going to throw their ass in jail.
[01:01:08.755 --> 01:01:11.297]  But if a white person pulls a gun out, they shoot them because they should.
[01:01:13.198 --> 01:01:14.499]  But here's the big breakdown.
[01:01:14.539 --> 01:01:15.740]  He's got the study linked here.
[01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:16.801]  It's all right there.
[01:01:17.061 --> 01:01:18.542]  By the way, his study was years ago.
[01:01:18.602 --> 01:01:19.743]  The numbers are even worse now.
[01:01:21.089 --> 01:01:24.933]  He found a substantive percentage higher of whites are shot per capita.
[01:01:25.453 --> 01:01:26.695]  Now it's double.
[01:01:28.096 --> 01:01:29.798]  And are some cops out of their mind?
[01:01:30.518 --> 01:01:31.800]  You saw that video last week.
[01:01:32.641 --> 01:01:33.682]  At least if you were tuned in, you did.
[01:01:34.122 --> 01:01:39.167]  Out of Florida, where a cop literally has a mental breakdown.
[01:01:39.267 --> 01:01:42.751]  A suspect is in the squad car in handcuffs.
[01:01:44.266 --> 01:01:47.768]  And the cops start shooting into the squad car, shooting the person in handcuffs?
[01:01:48.429 --> 01:01:49.209]  Completely insane.
[01:01:49.849 --> 01:01:51.290]  There are some lunatic cops out there.
[01:01:51.651 --> 01:01:52.551]  Put them in a mental institution.
[01:01:52.571 --> 01:01:53.432]  Throw their ass in prison.
[01:01:54.652 --> 01:02:00.056]  But on average, the police are not out there trying to randomly shoot people.
[01:02:00.076 --> 01:02:02.657]  You know how much trouble they go through when that happens?
[01:02:04.138 --> 01:02:05.739]  Kind of like Dirty Harry in the movies.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.901]  Police don't want to shoot people.
[01:02:09.181 --> 01:02:09.762]  99% of them.
[01:02:11.203 --> 01:02:13.324]  Occasionally you get a crazy person in there that does want to.
[01:02:14.451 --> 01:02:15.891]  But it's just not true, folks.
[01:02:15.951 --> 01:02:17.792]  But we're 350 million people.
[01:02:18.752 --> 01:02:28.234]  So the media can cherry pick cases where a cop does something wrong and then put it up there and say, this is everything.
[01:02:28.294 --> 01:02:30.854]  Is our problem really the police or is it crime?
[01:02:31.274 --> 01:02:33.495]  Is our problem really the police or is it open borders?
[01:02:34.015 --> 01:02:36.275]  Is our problem really the police or is it devalued currencies?
[01:02:36.996 --> 01:02:41.897]  Is our problem the police that kill a couple thousand people a year versus 120,000 from fentanyl?
[01:02:43.979 --> 01:02:46.181]  And most of those police shootings are justified.
[01:02:46.681 --> 01:02:47.362]  They get called.
[01:02:47.382 --> 01:02:51.265]  The most common one is the police get called to a domestic dispute.
[01:02:52.986 --> 01:02:54.067]  And mom and dad are drunk.
[01:02:54.107 --> 01:02:55.388]  The kids are running around crying.
[01:02:55.448 --> 01:02:56.849]  Dad just beat the hell out of mom.
[01:02:58.910 --> 01:02:59.671]  Cops pull up.
[01:03:00.131 --> 01:03:01.372]  Dad runs out with a gun.
[01:03:02.573 --> 01:03:04.575]  Starts shooting at the cops and they kill his ass.
[01:03:05.775 --> 01:03:06.536]  That's the majority.
[01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:07.237]  Look up the numbers.
[01:03:08.898 --> 01:03:11.620]  And then next it's police in shootouts with people.
[01:03:13.268 --> 01:03:13.788]  We're good to go.
[01:03:13.808 --> 01:03:14.268]  We're good to go.
[01:03:14.288 --> 01:03:14.749]  We're good to go.
[01:03:44.155 --> 01:03:45.376]  I thought I was shot.
[01:03:46.996 --> 01:03:54.039]  It's a complete lunatic.
[01:03:54.659 --> 01:03:55.720]  Look at this right here.
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:04:00.882]  But you can't sit there and then say that every cop is bad.
[01:04:01.142 --> 01:04:03.063]  And my job is not an apology to the police.
[01:04:03.703 --> 01:04:08.625]  You just can't take one bad cop out of close to a million police in this country...
[01:04:10.845 --> 01:04:11.205]  We're good to go.
[01:04:11.225 --> 01:04:11.365]  I think?
[01:04:33.996 --> 01:04:35.537]  As if... I mean, does Joy Reid owe me money?
[01:04:59.650 --> 01:05:00.571]  Hello, Americans.
[01:05:01.351 --> 01:05:02.992]  I want to share with you a story.
[01:05:03.613 --> 01:05:09.897]  A story about inflammation, the silent menace that lurks within our bodies, affecting our health and well-being.
[01:05:10.938 --> 01:05:16.742]  Inflammation, the root cause of countless ailments, quietly wreaking havoc over time.
[01:05:17.803 --> 01:05:25.448]  Long-term exposure to inflammation has been linked to a myriad of health issues, from heart disease to arthritis, even cognitive decline.
[01:05:26.488 --> 01:05:34.075]  But fear not, for there's a beacon of hope found in the wisdom of nature, a remedy that has stood the test of time, turmeric.
[01:05:34.853 --> 01:05:48.161]  And now I present to you Baudis from InfoWarsStore.com, a powerful blend crafted with precision-boasting 95% curcuminoids extracted from turmeric.
[01:05:48.261 --> 01:05:50.283]  It's good for your heart, your brain, everything.
[01:05:50.403 --> 01:05:57.967]  It is 40% off, back in stock, Baudis Ultimate Turmeric Formula, InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:06:13.134 --> 01:06:22.018]  From the front lines of the Information Ward, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:22.358 --> 01:06:27.501]  All right, in the next two hours, we've got four different funeral home directors and bombers.
[01:06:29.068 --> 01:06:30.529]  You name it, coming on the broadcast.
[01:06:30.569 --> 01:06:45.098]  And I have right here stack after stack of scientific study and report admitting that all four of the so-called vaccines administered for COVID cause blood clots.
[01:06:45.718 --> 01:06:48.060]  But they cause blood clots like no one's ever seen.
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:50.982]  And there's been pathologists and epidemiologists
[01:06:51.994 --> 01:06:53.335]  We're good to go.
[01:07:15.339 --> 01:07:17.180]  And Richard Hirschman is one of those people.
[01:07:17.221 --> 01:07:18.341]  He's our first guest today.
[01:07:19.162 --> 01:07:20.823]  Funeral director and embalmer.
[01:07:21.023 --> 01:07:22.504]  Richard Hirschman is an embalmer.
[01:07:22.524 --> 01:07:24.026]  He's concerned about humanity.
[01:07:24.526 --> 01:07:26.708]  He began working in the funeral home business in 2001.
[01:07:27.408 --> 01:07:30.951]  His concern is in the strange clotting issues that began early in 2021.
[01:07:31.471 --> 01:07:35.554]  He first publicly spoke out in 2022 on the Dr. Jane Ruby Show.
[01:07:36.115 --> 01:07:37.696]  He was also in the documentary Died Suddenly.
[01:07:37.716 --> 01:07:41.379]  He continues to see the strange clotting and just trying to bring awareness
[01:07:42.139 --> 01:07:43.460]  To find solutions.
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:48.403]  We also have massive miscarriages happening, and I've got New England Medical Journal on that.
[01:07:50.265 --> 01:07:53.066]  So he's got a tough job, folks, but somebody's got to do it.
[01:07:54.287 --> 01:07:57.690]  And they all see the same thing they've never seen before suddenly showing up.
[01:07:58.490 --> 01:08:06.816]  Let's go ahead and roll a short clip here of him removing a giant, bizarre white clot.
[01:08:08.044 --> 01:08:12.628]  Out of a man's carotid arteries, carotid artery out of his neck.
[01:08:13.889 --> 01:08:18.052]  And, again, no one's ever seen anything like this, folks.
[01:08:18.212 --> 01:08:19.734]  The color, all of it, the size.
[01:08:20.254 --> 01:08:23.157]  And it's like they flipped a light switch, and this all starts in 2021.
[01:08:23.577 --> 01:08:24.097]  Here's the clip.
[01:08:24.858 --> 01:08:25.599]  Should I be wrong?
[01:08:25.679 --> 01:08:30.022]  Oh, no, there it is.
[01:08:36.688 --> 01:08:36.968]  Pulling it.
[01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:40.490]  This is the jugular vein.
[01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:41.431]  Should I pull this head out?
[01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:41.971]  It broke.
[01:08:42.111 --> 01:08:42.311]  Wow.
[01:08:42.331 --> 01:08:43.713]  That's good.
[01:08:43.813 --> 01:08:44.173]  Hold on.
[01:08:44.553 --> 01:08:47.315]  I'm gonna show how stretchy this stuff is.
[01:09:07.833 --> 01:09:09.815]  I've already squeezed it.
[01:09:13.177 --> 01:09:15.059]  See, it's very much like a rubber band.
[01:09:15.099 --> 01:09:23.346]  Prepare it to the size of your hand or your finger so we can see how long it is.
[01:09:25.347 --> 01:09:25.607]  Wow.
[01:09:25.988 --> 01:09:30.812]  And what I was really reading three years ago was the embalmers were trying to get the blood out to put the
[01:09:31.988 --> 01:09:32.588]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:09:32.608 --> 01:09:35.869]  Just trying to bring awareness in order to help find solutions.
[01:09:57.011 --> 01:10:16.227]  Yeah, the strange clots are, there's a lot of different things that we're seeing in the embalming room that is abnormal, but these white fibrous structures, you know, like these things right here, these are the most alarming things that we're seeing, just like what you saw me pulling out of that juggler vein.
[01:10:17.268 --> 01:10:19.330]  And sir, can you put that back on screen for people again?
[01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:20.491]  Tell them where you got that.
[01:10:22.793 --> 01:10:25.335]  Well, the truth is, you know, I mean, I have
[01:10:25.848 --> 01:10:27.269]  Several samples of these.
[01:10:29.291 --> 01:10:33.715]  These are the strange white fibrous materials that we're seeing.
[01:10:35.377 --> 01:10:38.620]  You know, like this one right here came from an artery.
[01:10:39.721 --> 01:10:45.346]  And it was... If you were to stretch that out, that thing was, I believe, 27 inches long.
[01:10:46.827 --> 01:10:47.608]  We used to never see...
[01:10:50.154 --> 01:10:51.075]  We're good to go.
[01:10:51.155 --> 01:10:51.575]  I think?
[01:11:20.201 --> 01:11:28.790]  In the beginning, just about every one of us believed there's no way that these could be formed post-mortem because they're so strong.
[01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:30.832]  We're just not used to seeing this kind of stuff.
[01:11:34.896 --> 01:11:36.278]  Now, I want to slow down here.
[01:11:37.244 --> 01:11:37.704]  We're good to go.
[01:11:38.084 --> 01:11:38.285]  I think?
[01:12:03.579 --> 01:12:04.800]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:06.801]  Where's the government?
[01:12:07.342 --> 01:12:08.703]  Where's the CDC?
[01:12:08.783 --> 01:12:09.843]  Where's the FDA?
[01:12:10.244 --> 01:12:10.784]  Where are they?
[01:12:13.386 --> 01:12:16.888]  Well, I know they've got to be aware of what's happening.
[01:12:16.988 --> 01:12:18.710]  It's impossible for them not to know.
[01:12:18.730 --> 01:12:24.634]  I can just tell you my observations.
[01:12:25.955 --> 01:12:30.378]  Towards the end of 2020, we noticed an increase in blood clotting issues.
[01:12:31.118 --> 01:12:32.059]  And of course, we were all
[01:12:32.523 --> 01:12:35.904]  Kind of associating that maybe with the virus that was going out there.
[01:12:36.904 --> 01:12:43.345]  But when January of 2021 came, the clotting issues just got far, far worse.
[01:12:43.565 --> 01:12:53.347]  And then a few months into 2021, a lot of times I estimate May, but it could have been as early as March or April.
[01:12:54.588 --> 01:12:56.308]  But it was definitely no later than June.
[01:12:57.574 --> 01:13:03.035]  These white fibrous materials started or clots were showing up more and more often.
[01:13:03.515 --> 01:13:11.377]  The first time I seen this, Alex, I was kind of thinking, well, this is a weird anomaly and you just kind of move on.
[01:13:11.897 --> 01:13:23.179]  But then when you start running into it again and again, as 2021 was moving along, I began becoming very concerned that something has to be causing this.
[01:13:24.011 --> 01:13:26.092]  And how are the doctors going to know?
[01:13:26.152 --> 01:13:30.913]  Because most all of the bodies that I found these in, they were not autopsied.
[01:13:30.973 --> 01:13:34.874]  So pathologists weren't seeing the bodies that I see.
[01:13:35.514 --> 01:13:39.675]  Yes, we get people that are sent off for autopsy on occasion.
[01:13:40.795 --> 01:13:48.558]  Usually that's for some kind of a, you know, they're looking for a foul play, like some kind of a murder scene or something like that.
[01:13:48.578 --> 01:13:48.758]  But, uh,
[01:13:51.255 --> 01:13:54.256]  These clots became more and more and more frequent.
[01:13:54.736 --> 01:14:01.838]  And in September of 2021 was the first time I took a photograph of this.
[01:14:02.678 --> 01:14:09.399]  Because as I was asking other morticians and embalmers, some of them had 30, 40, 50 years of experience.
[01:14:10.199 --> 01:14:14.220]  If they were there in the funeral home, I'd bring them back into the embalming room and ask them about it.
[01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:15.681]  They'd never seen anything.
[01:14:16.321 --> 01:14:18.842]  But the ones that weren't there, I had nothing to show them.
[01:14:18.922 --> 01:14:20.762]  So the pictures kind of helped.
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:25.261]  I can show these other colleagues, have you guys ever seen this?
[01:14:26.882 --> 01:14:29.723]  The answer was always no.
[01:14:30.343 --> 01:14:32.744]  I started gathering the evidence.
[01:14:32.764 --> 01:14:36.225]  I started taking photographs, more photographs in 2021 in the fall.
[01:14:36.245 --> 01:14:40.506]  In November of 2021, a lot of people were starting to ask me how often I was seeing this.
[01:14:40.546 --> 01:14:40.966]  To be honest,
[01:14:50.595 --> 01:14:52.476]  You know, I just knew it was a lot.
[01:14:52.636 --> 01:14:59.699]  I didn't know how often, but I started taking notes on my computer at home because I'm a trade embalmer.
[01:14:59.819 --> 01:15:05.302]  And so for tax purposes, you know, I have to keep records of how much money I make.
[01:15:05.382 --> 01:15:14.766]  And so I document everywhere I go so that I can keep an idea of, you know, separate the money I need for taxes.
[01:15:14.806 --> 01:15:17.408]  So I started making little notes on my computer.
[01:15:17.468 --> 01:15:19.629]  And at that time, it was just under 50% of the bodies.
[01:15:21.001 --> 01:15:22.322]  That I was embalming.
[01:15:22.342 --> 01:15:25.584]  I was finding these abnormal clots in them.
[01:15:25.864 --> 01:15:27.365]  That is so incredible.
[01:15:27.445 --> 01:15:29.687]  So you're talking to people that have done it 50 years, they've never seen it.
[01:15:30.107 --> 01:15:33.809]  You flip a switch, it's suddenly there, and now 50% of the bodies.
[01:15:33.829 --> 01:15:36.051]  Now, I've seen numbers from other countries and other places.
[01:15:36.932 --> 01:15:40.194]  Were you also seeing an uptick in the amount of business in dead people?
[01:15:41.695 --> 01:15:45.277]  In 2021, absolutely, especially in January.
[01:15:45.297 --> 01:15:47.639]  It got really, really busy right after the rollout.
[01:15:48.621 --> 01:15:55.764]  We were starting to get a lot of folks that were dying, you know, unusual.
[01:15:56.544 --> 01:16:01.506]  All the way up, usually deaths are happening in a hospital or under hospice care.
[01:16:02.106 --> 01:16:12.410]  I'm not saying that sometimes people don't die from heart attacks, you know, at home or under, you know, like hospice care or in nursing.
[01:16:12.450 --> 01:16:12.991]  That happens.
[01:16:13.071 --> 01:16:13.791]  It's always happened.
[01:16:14.445 --> 01:16:21.588]  But we were starting to get more people that were dying that were relatively healthy that nobody was understanding why they died.
[01:16:22.849 --> 01:16:28.591]  And what's interesting is I've also seen the hospitals began to not really call for autopsies and just pass them through.
[01:16:30.812 --> 01:16:34.514]  Well, because everybody was made to be afraid of this virus.
[01:16:35.014 --> 01:16:35.134]  And...
[01:16:36.462 --> 01:16:38.304]  You know, here we are in the embalming room.
[01:16:38.704 --> 01:16:40.085]  We're handling the body.
[01:16:40.646 --> 01:16:45.389]  We're handling the blood and bodily fluids in preparation for the funeral service.
[01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:47.711]  We gotta do what we gotta do.
[01:16:47.872 --> 01:16:48.832]  We're handling those.
[01:16:48.892 --> 01:16:55.538]  I don't know why they were afraid to take care of them in a lab to do autopsies and study what's really going on.
[01:16:55.558 --> 01:16:57.359]  It didn't make sense.
[01:16:58.921 --> 01:17:01.163]  But this is still happening, Alex.
[01:17:01.383 --> 01:17:02.384]  It's not stopped.
[01:17:03.104 --> 01:17:03.845]  I have sent
[01:17:04.525 --> 01:17:18.911]  A lot of these samples to different doctors, like Dr. Ryan Cole and others, even Mike Adams, which you know well, he did an analysis of these, and he made it public.
[01:17:19.991 --> 01:17:32.696]  And just to let you know, some of the researchers I've been talking with and sent them samples, as long as others, they have sent and had the same ICP-MS type
[01:17:33.294 --> 01:17:44.196]  Well, we're still working on this, or I say we're, but the people that I know that are still looking at this, what they're starting to believe is these are some kind of aberrant-type proteins.
[01:18:03.139 --> 01:18:15.226]  Which is the vaccine was meant to make the spike protein, and what they're thinking happened is when they put the mRNA in there, it changed the sequence in order to create that spike protein.
[01:18:15.667 --> 01:18:27.734]  But if you follow that chain of all of these letters in the RNA, it may be forming other proteins that are not intended –
[01:18:30.228 --> 01:18:31.909]  But yet they're still being formed.
[01:18:31.929 --> 01:18:32.909]  That's right.
[01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:39.933]  He's ordering the body to start self-assembling and producing proteins that then all basically self-assemble.
[01:18:41.554 --> 01:18:41.854]  Yes.
[01:18:42.735 --> 01:18:54.781]  Alex, even Mike Adams, most of us could not possibly believe that these clots could form post-mortem because they're so solid and hard.
[01:18:55.382 --> 01:18:58.163]  But I'm going to show you this right here.
[01:19:00.356 --> 01:19:03.679]  And this is my first relatively recent example.
[01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:04.259]  Let me guess.
[01:19:04.339 --> 01:19:06.421]  It keeps growing even when it's in a test tube.
[01:19:07.722 --> 01:19:07.942]  No.
[01:19:08.703 --> 01:19:14.127]  This formed outside of the body post-mortem, after death.
[01:19:14.247 --> 01:19:27.158]  So what we're thinking is happening is these abnormal proteins floating around in your circulatory system, something happens that causes these things to start clumping together.
[01:19:27.981 --> 01:19:34.905]  Think about it almost like if you take oil and you're mixing it with water, it doesn't want to mix, right?
[01:19:34.945 --> 01:19:41.709]  Well, when you stop stirring or shaking it up, eventually the oil separates out and it binds itself back together.
[01:19:42.149 --> 01:19:42.430]  Absolutely.
[01:19:42.450 --> 01:19:43.330]  I want to go back and be clear.
[01:19:43.530 --> 01:19:47.793]  You're saying that last vial you showed assembled outside a body?
[01:19:49.534 --> 01:19:49.754]  This...
[01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:52.081]  Sembled outside of the body.
[01:19:52.642 --> 01:19:54.603]  Go back to us.
[01:19:54.643 --> 01:19:56.765]  You took a little tentacle, and then it grew into that?
[01:19:56.805 --> 01:19:57.706]  Or describe what happened.
[01:19:57.726 --> 01:19:58.146]  This is huge.
[01:19:59.347 --> 01:19:59.907]  No, no.
[01:20:00.688 --> 01:20:15.080]  All right, so imagine you've got... I had a case that came in that had a very large tube, and I believe it was some kind of like a trans... Not a transfusion, but almost like a...
[01:20:16.294 --> 01:20:16.434]  Wow.
[01:20:16.454 --> 01:20:16.554]  Wow.
[01:20:44.136 --> 01:20:48.158]  It separated into these dark spots and this yellowish looking liquid.
[01:20:48.978 --> 01:20:53.120]  In that yellowish looking liquid came out these strange clots.
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:53.860]  Wow.
[01:20:54.700 --> 01:21:07.225]  And the thing is, Alex, is the cannula where these tubes were connected to the body, they had a cannula that goes into the vein itself and it's almost like a screen.
[01:21:07.245 --> 01:21:12.147]  It had little small holes in it so that the blood could transfer in and out of the body, right?
[01:21:13.297 --> 01:21:20.085]  Those holes were way too small for these clots to pass through.
[01:21:20.665 --> 01:21:25.191]  So that tells me this had to have formed after the person died.
[01:21:26.172 --> 01:21:31.558]  Either way, Alex, this is proof that there is something in the blood system
[01:21:32.264 --> 01:21:36.365]  That's floating around that I'm assuming should not be there.
[01:21:36.585 --> 01:21:37.645]  Now, what you just said is key.
[01:21:37.665 --> 01:21:39.106]  So I'm a layman, but I finally figured it out.
[01:21:39.506 --> 01:21:40.366]  Talk to me like I'm five.
[01:21:40.406 --> 01:21:41.146]  I figured it out, brother.
[01:21:41.727 --> 01:21:43.767]  You're saying it's all pumping around in the body.
[01:21:43.927 --> 01:21:48.748]  Once they die, it congeals out like blood and water, and then that's what we're dealing with.
[01:21:48.788 --> 01:21:50.029]  This is incredible.
[01:21:50.069 --> 01:21:50.769]  Stay right there.
[01:21:51.309 --> 01:21:51.870]  We're good to go.
[01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:19.935]  Discretion in single-point injection increased, or lack of distribution in single-point injection increased, fiber structures being removed, granular blood, dramatic increase of younger and non-old people dying.
[01:22:20.676 --> 01:22:24.237]  Tell us what you saw, Jamie, and what you think of what Richard was just saying.
[01:22:26.263 --> 01:22:28.045]  Hey, Alex.
[01:22:28.486 --> 01:22:33.231]  I completely agree with everything Richard just said.
[01:22:33.872 --> 01:22:45.927]  It was around about the same time in 2021 you mentioned there just about the distribution, like we were talking about getting the formaldehyde in the body.
[01:22:46.730 --> 01:22:47.411]  We're good to go.
[01:23:08.697 --> 01:23:11.218]  Where do you think we should go from here, Jamie?
[01:23:36.274 --> 01:23:45.421]  Well, I certainly like the direction that, you know, these researchers are going, you know, those that Richard is working with.
[01:23:45.661 --> 01:23:55.187]  I'm extremely thankful for them because ultimately something is wrong and, you know, people need to be aware of that.
[01:23:55.868 --> 01:23:58.970]  And ultimately, I'd like to know, you know, what's going on.
[01:24:03.618 --> 01:24:11.082]  Richard, I mean, I could ask you a thousand questions here, but while we have this big audience, what else do you want to impart to the audience and you too, Jamie?
[01:24:13.163 --> 01:24:15.845]  Alex, I want to go back.
[01:24:17.085 --> 01:24:18.566]  I've spoken with people.
[01:24:18.906 --> 01:24:20.307]  I've had cases.
[01:24:20.527 --> 01:24:27.090]  I know that this proof that I have showing that these things can form after death, post-mortem.
[01:24:28.111 --> 01:24:32.053]  I've had too many reports of these strange, similar cases
[01:24:33.079 --> 01:24:36.241]  Clots being removed from living people as well.
[01:24:36.681 --> 01:24:39.382]  So I'm not saying that these are only post-mortem.
[01:24:39.422 --> 01:24:41.063]  These are happening anti-mortem.
[01:24:41.343 --> 01:24:51.567]  And if you look at the reports of blood clotting issues around the country, I believe it's all related to the same thing.
[01:24:52.288 --> 01:24:59.411]  These researchers are also getting clots that are from living people, and they're going to be doing similar analysis
[01:24:59.932 --> 01:25:03.213]  To see if they are linked together, if they are very similar.
[01:25:03.633 --> 01:25:21.936]  Again, if they prove that they are, all they're going to be proving is that these abnormal proteins can be soluble and in liquid form, which might be one of the reasons why so many people have issues, but they have a hard time identifying these.
[01:25:24.036 --> 01:25:26.697]  If they're in a liquid state, you can go and have a test
[01:25:27.472 --> 01:25:31.696]  And they might not see it until it becomes a solid.
[01:25:31.836 --> 01:25:38.661]  Is this a reason why we're having a lot of issues with sudden cancers and unknown deaths?
[01:25:39.482 --> 01:25:48.850]  When you look at blood tests, most of the tests now, I believe, are blood tests that a computer reads off what's in there.
[01:25:48.910 --> 01:25:52.473]  But a computer can only tell you what it's been programmed to tell you.
[01:25:52.613 --> 01:25:56.556]  If these are abnormal or aberrant-type proteins, unknown proteins,
[01:25:57.073 --> 01:25:57.273]  Absolutely.
[01:25:57.333 --> 01:25:57.673]  All right.
[01:25:57.693 --> 01:26:01.755]  Well, we've got a bunch of other guests coming on that are in your same line of work.
[01:26:01.775 --> 01:26:02.536]  And as you said, embalmers.
[01:26:20.253 --> 01:26:20.793]  We're good to go.
[01:26:40.518 --> 01:26:42.879]  It looks pretty premeditated to me.
[01:26:43.199 --> 01:26:44.479]  And you can say, well, they didn't know then.
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:46.040]  Well, then why did they say that?
[01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:48.801]  And then why now are they covering it all up?
[01:26:49.421 --> 01:26:50.722]  Just speculating here.
[01:26:50.882 --> 01:26:52.122]  Bottom line, what do you think is going on?
[01:26:53.483 --> 01:26:57.244]  I think they knew that this was an issue.
[01:26:58.164 --> 01:26:59.645]  And there's a lot of pride.
[01:27:00.985 --> 01:27:03.386]  This is not a political thing left, right.
[01:27:04.066 --> 01:27:06.287]  It has nothing to do with gender or any of that stuff.
[01:27:06.847 --> 01:27:08.048]  Right now, I think...
[01:27:09.528 --> 01:27:19.515]  It's getting hard to kind of excuse this as not being a premeditated thing, but I think the big one is liability.
[01:27:19.896 --> 01:27:24.980]  They don't want to be liable for what's going on, and they knew this was happening.
[01:27:27.702 --> 01:27:33.666]  Naomi Wolf had a thing where she showed they have FOIA information that
[01:27:34.375 --> 01:27:42.065]  The CDC, the White House, all of them knew of the clotting issues and the myocarditis back in May of 2021.
[01:27:42.466 --> 01:27:47.112]  That's prior to the mandates, and yet they rolled this out anyway.
[01:27:47.653 --> 01:27:51.317]  Well, by the way, I'm not a medical doctor, but I read a lot of stuff and my dad is.
[01:27:52.037 --> 01:27:58.760]  A tiny little clot, a millimeter long and a half millimeter wide can kill you.
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.321]  These are gigantic.
[01:28:00.981 --> 01:28:02.822]  This is like over-the-top ridiculous.
[01:28:02.882 --> 01:28:04.863]  I mean, these things are humongous.
[01:28:06.344 --> 01:28:06.944]  That's right.
[01:28:07.404 --> 01:28:07.825]  That's right.
[01:28:08.205 --> 01:28:09.165]  And here's the thing.
[01:28:09.225 --> 01:28:13.447]  Everybody's talking about, well, we've got to have peer-reviewed articles, this, that, and the other.
[01:28:13.467 --> 01:28:15.568]  A lot of us don't understand that.
[01:28:15.909 --> 01:28:17.229]  But you know what you can't hide?
[01:28:17.770 --> 01:28:18.910]  Physical evidence.
[01:28:19.330 --> 01:28:20.591]  This is actual evidence.
[01:28:21.330 --> 01:28:21.651]  I think.
[01:28:27.745 --> 01:28:28.946]  This don't look right.
[01:28:29.166 --> 01:28:30.807]  Somebody needs to figure this out.
[01:28:30.967 --> 01:28:33.569]  And why are so many embalmers now speaking about it?
[01:28:33.909 --> 01:28:35.671]  All right, Richard Hirschman, very impressive.
[01:28:35.691 --> 01:28:37.812]  I asked my producer to get guests on.
[01:28:37.832 --> 01:28:38.733]  She got, like, five of them.
[01:28:38.773 --> 01:28:40.734]  So I hate to cut you guys off.
[01:28:41.175 --> 01:28:44.177]  And, you know, also, amazing job, Jamie, who's protecting our identity.
[01:28:44.497 --> 01:28:49.541]  I want to invite you both back on, both of you, for a full hour very, very soon.
[01:28:49.881 --> 01:28:51.382]  Thank you so much for exposing this.
[01:28:51.642 --> 01:28:52.523]  We're all counting on you.
[01:28:52.563 --> 01:28:52.863]  Thank you.
[01:28:54.024 --> 01:28:54.624]  God bless you.
[01:28:54.644 --> 01:28:55.124]  You're welcome.
[01:28:58.675 --> 01:29:08.222]  Unless you've been living under a rock, you've heard how amazing turmeric is for inflammation for your joints, your bones, your blood, your organs, your mind, everything.
[01:29:08.662 --> 01:29:11.605]  Well, we have Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula with 95% cuminoid extract.

[01:29:25.453 --> 01:29:28.254]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is amazing.
[01:29:28.494 --> 01:29:29.755]  You're missing out if you don't try it.

[01:29:59.724 --> 01:30:00.405]  We're good to go.
[01:30:15.885 --> 01:30:23.249]  We're talking up to 10 hours of clean energy per serving with TurboForce, exclusively available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:23.529 --> 01:30:24.810]  And it's discounted right now.

[01:30:45.322 --> 01:30:48.043]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[01:30:48.083 --> 01:30:48.903]  Thank you.
[01:30:48.923 --> 01:30:51.564]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[01:30:51.644 --> 01:30:53.084]  I started taking that stuff.
[01:30:53.165 --> 01:30:56.546]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[01:30:58.346 --> 01:30:59.727]  When did you start taking it?
[01:30:59.747 --> 01:31:03.888]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure, and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[01:31:03.908 --> 01:31:04.028]  Mm-hmm.
[01:31:14.372 --> 01:31:14.512]  Mm-hmm.
[01:31:30.692 --> 01:31:44.579]  And even though I do think all your other products are good, I recommend to anybody that they start with X2 iodine because it detoxifies your body and kind of kicks your natural DNA into full force.
[01:31:44.659 --> 01:31:48.121]  So in my life, I found X2 iodine the best.
[01:31:48.602 --> 01:31:52.043]  I tried other iodines and they didn't have the same effect.
[01:31:52.364 --> 01:31:54.645]  So X2 iodine, I really wanted to point that out.
[01:31:58.575 --> 01:32:05.077]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the globalist agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[01:32:05.157 --> 01:32:19.322]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections, masquerading as vaccines.
[01:32:19.502 --> 01:32:24.384]  It is so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives oblivious.
[01:32:25.779 --> 01:32:28.485]  And you realize, Ingrid's not bliss, it equals death.
[01:32:30.162 --> 01:32:50.560]  But people are starting to really understand how serious things are, and that's a hard thing to do, because to wake up to a disturbing reality and realize that we're in the middle of a giant biological weapons war against humanity, and that there's mass sterilization that's already taking place, cutting off all the major energy sources, is really hard to deal with, but it's the reality.
[01:32:51.141 --> 01:32:55.325]  Facing it is our only chance to turn this around, because stuff's about to get really, really nasty.
[01:32:55.725 --> 01:32:56.366]  Infowars.com.
[01:33:00.259 --> 01:33:06.201]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:12.463 --> 01:33:19.385]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:22.868 --> 01:33:30.771]  Alright, one of the leading people kind of organizing this and exposing it has been former Air Force Major Thomas Haviland.
[01:33:31.531 --> 01:33:38.173]  Finds 70% of embalmers reports seeing with strange blood clots beginning in 2021, right after the shots rolled out.
[01:33:39.013 --> 01:33:44.435]  And so, they got so many great guests today, I was confused that only some are on here, some are on there.
[01:33:44.495 --> 01:33:48.176]  No, they're able to cross over, so that's great because so much information.
[01:33:48.216 --> 01:33:50.177]  I can't wait to talk to
[01:33:52.273 --> 01:33:54.775]  Former Air Force Major Thomas Haviland, because I feel like I know him.
[01:33:54.815 --> 01:33:55.916]  I've seen so many of his reports.
[01:33:55.976 --> 01:33:58.078]  So he's going to be joining us at Riding Shotgun.
[01:33:58.478 --> 01:34:01.100]  He's put together a big PowerPoint presentation on this.
[01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:03.162]  We'll be going to him here in just a few minutes.
[01:34:03.862 --> 01:34:05.444]  But I wanted to be able to finish up.
[01:34:06.485 --> 01:34:17.953]  With Richard Hirschman, who has gone public now for years, and of course Jamie, who is a funeral service professional certified crematory operator who's seen the same things.
[01:34:18.634 --> 01:34:26.019]  And so before I let you guys go, I wanted to have you put out any other information you want because this is so obviously critical to humanity.
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:29.962]  So Jamie, anything else you'd like to add for folks or observations?
[01:34:31.811 --> 01:34:37.593]  Yeah, Alex, I would just like to say people need to wake up.
[01:34:37.713 --> 01:34:40.454]  This is serious.
[01:34:40.575 --> 01:34:41.955]  We don't know what this is.
[01:34:42.455 --> 01:34:48.057]  We've got to think critically before we just put anything into our bodies.
[01:34:49.878 --> 01:34:54.220]  And I just thank you for having us on here today, allowing us to have a voice.
[01:34:54.540 --> 01:34:54.860]  Thank you.
[01:34:58.107 --> 01:34:59.731]  Let me ask you this, though, in closing, Jamie.
[01:34:59.852 --> 01:35:01.496]  What do you think should be done about this?
[01:35:01.557 --> 01:35:03.783]  Because it's conclusive.
[01:35:05.653 --> 01:35:06.613]  I work seven days a week.
[01:35:06.693 --> 01:35:07.374]  It's conclusive.
[01:35:07.414 --> 01:35:19.637]  I've been seeing for almost three years coroners from Sweden and Denmark and the Netherlands and France and Germany and Ireland and Scotland and New Zealand and Australia and Canada and the U.S.
[01:35:20.198 --> 01:35:22.678]  And anywhere these shots are given out, they're going, what the hell is this?
[01:35:22.718 --> 01:35:23.579]  We've never seen this before.
[01:35:23.619 --> 01:35:25.719]  And I've seen some of the funeral home directors.
[01:35:25.799 --> 01:35:27.800]  I've been working 39 years, never seen this.
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:28.880]  We're good to go.
[01:35:58.738 --> 01:36:01.922]  Very popular individual who is over in Australia.
[01:36:02.382 --> 01:36:06.687]  Funeral director John O'Looney is getting banned off the internet, banned off a bunch of platforms.
[01:36:07.067 --> 01:36:14.816]  As he tells the truth, how the hell do people in big tech and the system cover up something that's clearly going to hurt them too?
[01:36:14.876 --> 01:36:18.880]  It's like opening the borders and shipping in fentanyl and making jokes about it.
[01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:20.302]  And now the CEO of YouTube...
[01:36:20.922 --> 01:36:22.384]  Alex, I think I've heard you say useful idiots.
[01:36:22.404 --> 01:36:22.504]  Yes.
[01:36:46.909 --> 01:36:47.549]  All right, Jamie.
[01:36:47.569 --> 01:36:49.890]  Well, thank you so much, and I appreciate you joining us.
[01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:52.991]  Finishing up with Richard Hirschman, very impressive information, sir.
[01:36:53.431 --> 01:36:54.571]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[01:36:56.052 --> 01:37:04.034]  Alex, again, everybody's waiting for all these peer-reviewed articles, this, that, and the other.
[01:37:04.614 --> 01:37:10.636]  I think the reason why most of us embalmers are early to notice this
[01:37:11.229 --> 01:37:14.171]  Is because we've been dealing with the blood for years.
[01:37:14.271 --> 01:37:17.832]  I mean, we've dealt with typical blood clotting issues in the past.
[01:37:18.893 --> 01:37:26.897]  What we noticed, I know myself, I noticed an obvious change in the blood of the bodies I was working on.
[01:37:27.597 --> 01:37:38.383]  Now, most of the doctors that are out there, I'm not trying to throw any doctors under the bus or anything, but they don't drain people's blood out and pump formaldehyde in them.
[01:37:38.423 --> 01:37:40.244]  They're not used to what we see.
[01:37:40.845 --> 01:37:46.609]  Even pathologists that might do an autopsy on somebody, they're looking at the actual organs.
[01:37:46.909 --> 01:37:50.431]  They're not flushing out typically the blood system itself.
[01:37:51.131 --> 01:37:54.113]  We are seeing something very highly abnormal.
[01:37:54.153 --> 01:38:00.557]  The big white fibrous clots is obviously the biggest thing that is in everybody's faces.
[01:38:00.617 --> 01:38:05.900]  The pictures that I've taken that are obvious something's not right.
[01:38:06.001 --> 01:38:07.001]  But it's more than that.
[01:38:07.061 --> 01:38:08.862]  We have what we call dirty blood.
[01:38:09.443 --> 01:38:09.943]  It looks like
[01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:11.090]  We're good to go.
[01:38:35.094 --> 01:38:41.320]  Because they continue to accumulate post-mortem might be the reason why we noticed this change early.
[01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:47.346]  And, you know, when we started sounding the alarm, all these doctors are saying it's not true.
[01:38:47.386 --> 01:38:48.307]  How can you prove it?
[01:38:48.427 --> 01:38:49.007]  Whatever.
[01:38:49.648 --> 01:38:50.849]  I've showed images.
[01:38:51.069 --> 01:38:53.351]  I've had a few videos that I've put out there.
[01:38:53.371 --> 01:38:57.515]  And the one that I posted yesterday, you know, is obvious evidence.
[01:38:58.604 --> 01:38:59.465]  It's right there.
[01:38:59.705 --> 01:39:01.166]  I mean, the evidence is in front of you.
[01:39:01.286 --> 01:39:04.328]  If people don't want to look at it and believe it, fine.
[01:39:04.388 --> 01:39:06.430]  If you want to blame it on anything, go ahead.
[01:39:06.930 --> 01:39:08.872]  Come with a great explanation.
[01:39:09.212 --> 01:39:12.194]  But just denying it doesn't change anything.
[01:39:12.515 --> 01:39:14.136]  And we don't need to argue about it.
[01:39:14.836 --> 01:39:26.305]  People can sit there and talk about whether these are nanotechnology, whether this is hydrogels, graphene oxide, amyloid proteins, all these arguments about this stuff.
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:27.140]  Powerfully said.
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:27.981]  We've got to study this.
[01:39:28.002 --> 01:39:28.923]  We've got to look into it.
[01:39:45.276 --> 01:39:45.876]  We're good to go.
[01:40:13.234 --> 01:40:22.942]  But I think of the analogy of the 1980s movie The Thing where you get a few cells of it, it takes over your cells and replicates and then basically takes over your body and mimics it.
[01:40:23.282 --> 01:40:23.903]  And then I thought...
[01:40:24.926 --> 01:40:34.175]  There's an even quicker way to illustrate this, and I'm not saying this is what's happening, but it's like an allegory of how scary it is, of a movie in the mid-'80s called The Stuff.
[01:40:35.035 --> 01:40:49.509]  And a meteorite crashes, a guy tastes it, it takes over his body, and then they basically, aliens take over your body, and they set up facilities to give you the stuff, and then the stuff basically takes your body over, and then finally the government finds out about it and stops it.
[01:40:50.369 --> 01:40:57.133]  Except this stuff just basically kills you, and they have plausible deniability, but it does self-replicate in the body.
[01:40:57.353 --> 01:41:04.757]  Here's a clip from the 1980s B-horror movie.
[01:41:04.917 --> 01:41:10.461]  Enough is never enough of the stuff.
[01:41:17.315 --> 01:41:21.777]  The stuff, the taste that makes you hungry for more.
[01:41:22.217 --> 01:41:27.259]  The stuff, the taste that delivers.
[01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:33.421]  We interrupt this presentation with the following urgent message.
[01:41:33.801 --> 01:41:35.902]  Tonight, America is in grave danger.
[01:41:38.443 --> 01:41:42.684]  We are under alien attack by a popular dessert known as the stuff.
[01:41:44.385 --> 01:41:45.926]  Here, Jason, take some.
[01:41:46.026 --> 01:41:46.266]  No!
[01:41:47.267 --> 01:41:47.967]  Don't eat that.
[01:41:49.588 --> 01:41:52.170]  There is something alive in there.
[01:41:52.590 --> 01:41:53.111]  Tasty.
[01:41:55.032 --> 01:41:56.373]  There's something alive in yogurt.
[01:41:56.693 --> 01:41:58.054]  It's called benign bacteria.
[01:42:02.277 --> 01:42:07.600]  If the stuff is in your house, do not eat it.
[01:42:07.700 --> 01:42:09.681]  If you have it on your shelves, do not sell it.
[01:42:11.963 --> 01:42:15.445]  If you distribute this material, close your doors, make no more sales.
[01:42:23.110 --> 01:42:25.111]  Enough is ever enough.
[01:42:35.073 --> 01:42:38.494]  Now the reason I show that is not to make light of this, but that can get the public's attention.
[01:42:38.854 --> 01:42:46.396]  This is something causing your body to self-replicate giant blood clots that people in the business haven't, have embalmed me, have not seen in 50 years.
[01:42:46.877 --> 01:42:48.377]  This is biblical in proportions.
[01:42:48.657 --> 01:42:50.177]  Closing comments on that, Richard Hirschman.
[01:42:51.518 --> 01:42:52.238]  Well, um,
[01:42:52.754 --> 01:42:56.457]  Yeah, you know, it's interesting.
[01:42:56.477 --> 01:43:00.061]  I know that this has got to be something in the body.
[01:43:00.281 --> 01:43:08.128]  It must be self-replicating, creating these additional proteins that accumulate until it becomes an issue for the individual.
[01:43:09.006 --> 01:43:11.827]  We've got to figure out what's causing this to go on.
[01:43:12.087 --> 01:43:14.068]  And how to reverse it.
[01:43:14.108 --> 01:43:15.068]  Do you know of anything?
[01:43:15.088 --> 01:43:18.370]  I guess you're at the rubber meets the road.
[01:43:18.410 --> 01:43:19.630]  All you see is people full of this.
[01:43:20.210 --> 01:43:25.212]  We need top-level scientists figuring out how the hell do we isolate this, find out what it is, and reverse it, right?
[01:43:26.633 --> 01:43:32.475]  We do, and I caution on giving advice because I'm not a medical doctor.
[01:43:32.835 --> 01:43:38.017]  I know there's lots of people like Dr. Peter McCullough, who I respect highly, and
[01:43:39.725 --> 01:43:47.711]  There's lots of people that have different therapies, but you're right, we need to figure out something that we can prove it.
[01:43:47.751 --> 01:43:56.519]  But we can't prove that it's helping until we can verify that this protein or whatever this substance is, is being reduced from the body.
[01:43:56.539 --> 01:44:00.402]  And if we don't know what it is, how do we know we're getting rid of it?
[01:44:01.249 --> 01:44:03.070]  All right, we should be putting this on screen.
[01:44:03.590 --> 01:44:10.334]  You are R underscore Hirschman on X. R underscore Hirschman on X. Incredible information.
[01:44:10.834 --> 01:44:12.896]  Joe Rogan called me this week and he said, why do we have this guy on?
[01:44:12.956 --> 01:44:13.716]  I said, why haven't I?
[01:44:14.316 --> 01:44:15.197]  Why doesn't Joe have you on?
[01:44:15.217 --> 01:44:16.257]  We need Joe to get you on.
[01:44:17.418 --> 01:44:20.840]  R underscore Hirschman, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:26.083]  Jamie does the same business, but she is obviously private with anonymity, which makes sense.
[01:44:26.503 --> 01:44:27.664]  Thank you so much for the time, sir.
[01:44:29.380 --> 01:44:30.020]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:44:30.621 --> 01:44:39.067]  All right, for the balance of the broadcast, and we've got some other folks joining us, Bill Funk and others, is Thomas Habelin, and he spent 20 years in the U.S.
[01:44:39.187 --> 01:44:40.708]  Air Force, retired the rank of major.
[01:44:41.129 --> 01:44:44.711]  After that, Tom was a defense contractor working with the Air Force on an additional 16 years.
[01:44:45.272 --> 01:44:53.458]  Tom is an electrical engineer and data analyst and has worked with fighter aircraft such as the F-16 Falcon, the F-22 Raptor, and the F-117 Stealth Fighter.
[01:44:53.978 --> 01:44:57.321]  After watching Died Suddenly documentary, Tom has...
[01:44:58.461 --> 01:45:11.509]  Conducted not one but two worldwide embalmer blood clot surveys to investigate the appearances of new and unusual white fibrous clots in corpses and their potential link to the COVID vaccine as described by embalmers in the documentary.
[01:45:11.529 --> 01:45:13.030]  So he's taking action.
[01:45:13.510 --> 01:45:14.531]  Tom, thank you so much, sir.
[01:45:37.483 --> 01:45:38.063]  Hey, Alex.
[01:45:38.504 --> 01:45:42.345]  Thanks for having me on the show to talk about this very important topic.
[01:45:42.405 --> 01:45:44.566]  It all started for me with the Died Suddenly movie.
[01:45:44.606 --> 01:45:46.267]  I watched that the night that it premiered.
[01:45:46.707 --> 01:45:51.269]  It was the week of Thanksgiving of 2022 and the Monday of that week.
[01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:57.892]  I know there were some problems with the film, but at the 13-minute and 15-second mark in that movie, an amazing statement was made.
[01:45:58.513 --> 01:46:01.094]  An embalmer from the state of Indiana, Mr. Wallace Hooker,
[01:46:01.872 --> 01:46:10.278]  I was briefing, lecturing at an Ohio Embalmers Association conference in Columbus, Ohio on the 26th of October in 2022.
[01:46:11.179 --> 01:46:13.821]  And he was lecturing to a room of about 100 embalmers.
[01:46:14.541 --> 01:46:20.226]  And he showed them photographs of these white fibrous cloths, like, you know, Richard Hirschman showed you, and I'll show the audience again here.
[01:46:20.706 --> 01:46:28.452]  He showed photographs of these, Alex, to the audience, and he said, by a show of hands, how many of you embalmers are seeing these same strange white fibrous cloths?
[01:46:29.119 --> 01:46:33.102]  And he said almost the entire room of 100 embalmers raised their hands yes.
[01:46:34.002 --> 01:46:36.584]  He then asked him, Alex, well, when did you start seeing them?
[01:46:37.024 --> 01:46:41.988]  And they all agreed it was in the middle of 2021 after the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines.
[01:46:42.608 --> 01:46:45.830]  So whatever else went on in that movie, I thought that was an amazing statement, right?
[01:46:45.870 --> 01:46:47.471]  That statement's either true or false.
[01:46:47.772 --> 01:46:49.653]  Either those embalmers raised their hands or they didn't.
[01:46:50.430 --> 01:46:56.554]  So I got up the next morning, Alex, after that movie, and I said, you know, I don't think any reporter's going to chase after this story.
[01:46:57.054 --> 01:46:59.856]  So I decided myself to call the Ohio Involvers Association.
[01:46:59.996 --> 01:47:01.597]  They're located in Cincinnati, Ohio.
[01:47:01.617 --> 01:47:03.659]  So you felt a conviction to do this?
[01:47:04.738 --> 01:47:05.839]  Yeah.
[01:47:06.099 --> 01:47:07.720]  I was retired, and I had the time to do it.
[01:47:08.181 --> 01:47:11.303]  So I called them, and they're about an hour south of me.
[01:47:11.343 --> 01:47:12.324]  I live in Dayton, Ohio.
[01:47:12.764 --> 01:47:23.153]  And I talked to their president, their vice president, and their secretary, and I asked all three gentlemen, did you happen to be in the room at the time that those embalmers supposedly raised their hands saying they saw the clots?
[01:47:23.753 --> 01:47:25.955]  Well, none of the three of them happened to be in the room at the time.
[01:47:26.545 --> 01:47:35.454]  However, the vice president at that time, who is now actually the president of the Ohio Embalmers Association, said to me, Tom, I'm seeing the white fibers clots, too.
[01:47:35.974 --> 01:47:38.477]  He owns a funeral home about an hour north of me.
[01:47:38.537 --> 01:47:42.701]  So, Boone, you pick up a phone to check if it's real, and it's immediately confirmation.
[01:47:43.746 --> 01:47:44.187]  Correct.
[01:47:44.467 --> 01:47:53.076]  So I know that he corroborated, this official officer of the Ohio Embalmers Association, corroborated the six or seven embalmers and the died suddenly movie.
[01:47:53.396 --> 01:48:02.085]  So I said right there and then, hey, I need to do a survey, a nationwide survey, which I then later turned into a worldwide survey to see just how big this phenomenon was.
[01:48:03.306 --> 01:48:03.887]  Please continue.
[01:48:05.063 --> 01:48:05.443]  Alex Jones Show!
[01:48:05.483 --> 01:48:05.823]  We're good to go.
[01:48:29.016 --> 01:48:35.640]  The main consensus of those embalmers was indeed that the clot started in 2021 after the rollout of the vaccines.
[01:48:36.340 --> 01:48:45.566]  And maybe the most shocking result, Alex, was that many of the embalmers were seeing these white fibers clots and up to 50% or more of their corpses.
[01:48:46.446 --> 01:48:49.308]  And that's exactly what Richard Hirschman just said.
[01:48:49.328 --> 01:48:52.690]  And this is speculation, but let's talk about people being scared.
[01:48:53.689 --> 01:48:54.150]  We're good to go.
[01:49:10.609 --> 01:49:11.470]  Quite possibly.
[01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:12.250]  Quite possibly.
[01:49:12.310 --> 01:49:14.371]  I trusted every answer I got when I did the survey.
[01:49:14.591 --> 01:49:19.574]  By the way, both last year's survey and this year's survey, I ran them as unbiasedly as I could, Alex.
[01:49:19.975 --> 01:49:22.056]  I only asked the embalmers, what did you see?
[01:49:22.616 --> 01:49:23.497]  When did you see it?
[01:49:23.957 --> 01:49:25.018]  And how much did you see?
[01:49:25.038 --> 01:49:27.519]  And what percentage of your corpses did you see these clots?
[01:49:27.940 --> 01:49:34.323]  I never in either of my surveys, either last year or this year, ever mentioned the words COVID or COVID vaccine.
[01:49:34.624 --> 01:49:35.724]  I didn't want to leave the witness.
[01:49:36.425 --> 01:49:36.645]  Wow.
[01:49:36.845 --> 01:49:39.206]  So I only asked the embalmers questions that they could answer.
[01:49:39.827 --> 01:49:40.047]  What?
[01:49:40.783 --> 01:49:42.204]  When and how much?
[01:49:43.585 --> 01:49:43.985]  Wow.
[01:49:44.345 --> 01:49:45.506]  So, please continue.
[01:49:47.848 --> 01:49:52.111]  In both surveys, I used a two-pronged approach in distributing the surveys, Alex.
[01:49:52.151 --> 01:49:57.594]  We used a tool called SurveyMonkey, and I sent the survey out in a link in an email.
[01:49:58.235 --> 01:50:07.721]  And the top-down approach I used is I sent it to 50 national, regional, and state funeral director associations, each with hundreds of members underneath them, funeral directors and embalmers.
[01:50:08.321 --> 01:50:10.663]  I also then used a bottom-up approach.
[01:50:10.683 --> 01:50:18.529]  I found out the email addresses for over 1,700 funeral homes around the world, and I sent the email to them directly with a link to the survey.
[01:50:18.549 --> 01:50:19.490]  It was really easy to take.
[01:50:19.810 --> 01:50:21.531]  Just click on the link, and it took you right there.
[01:50:22.352 --> 01:50:24.033]  This year's survey was 12 questions.
[01:50:24.093 --> 01:50:25.955]  Last year's survey was 7 questions.
[01:50:25.975 --> 01:50:28.617]  It takes only about 3 or 4 minutes for the embalmers to take.
[01:50:29.266 --> 01:50:31.707]  What was interesting, though, I was happy this year.
[01:50:31.747 --> 01:50:35.209]  I got 269 responses to this year's survey, which was great.
[01:50:35.229 --> 01:50:38.011]  It was 90 more responses than I got to last year's survey.
[01:50:38.671 --> 01:50:41.793]  But I actually detected a little bit of a scandal, Alex, going on.
[01:50:42.213 --> 01:50:52.118]  Because when I set this year's survey out on the 8th of December, the first day I sent it out to the world, I checked my SurveyMonkey collectors about five days into the survey.
[01:50:52.458 --> 01:50:54.479]  I only had about 14 responses to it.
[01:50:54.819 --> 01:50:55.960]  I said, oh, this is terrible.
[01:50:55.980 --> 01:50:57.321]  I need more responses than this.
[01:50:58.081 --> 01:51:00.082]  So I contacted the 30 U.S.
[01:51:00.102 --> 01:51:03.584]  states, their funeral director associations that I had sent the survey to.
[01:51:03.604 --> 01:51:05.125]  I picked the top 30 U.S.
[01:51:05.145 --> 01:51:08.347]  states by population, including red states and blue states.
[01:51:09.148 --> 01:51:14.531]  Ohio, Texas, Florida, but also California, Illinois, New York, Massachusetts.
[01:51:14.551 --> 01:51:18.113]  So I try to be fair that way and not get any red-blue bias.
[01:51:19.210 --> 01:51:26.732]  But when I sent this survey out to them, I called the 30 state funeral director association presidents.
[01:51:26.772 --> 01:51:36.615]  I either talked to their president, their secretary, or somebody else in their office, and I said, hey, could you please forward that survey that I sent to you last week out to all your active embalmers so they can take the survey?
[01:51:36.675 --> 01:51:38.935]  And let me guess, it had been blocked by the spam filter.
[01:51:40.616 --> 01:51:40.876]  No.
[01:51:41.636 --> 01:51:44.657]  God bless the Pennsylvania Funeral Directors Association, Alex.
[01:51:45.405 --> 01:51:46.886]  They did exactly as I asked.
[01:51:47.046 --> 01:51:50.089]  And I know that because the next day I checked my SurveyMonkey collectors.
[01:51:50.449 --> 01:51:54.973]  I had 93 responses from embalmers, Alex, and they were all from one state, Pennsylvania.
[01:51:55.533 --> 01:51:59.816]  I then got up the next day and I had another 32 responses from embalmers.
[01:51:59.836 --> 01:52:01.438]  And again, they were all from Pennsylvania.
[01:52:01.838 --> 01:52:06.282]  So in two days, I got 125 responses from embalmers in just one state.
[01:52:06.802 --> 01:52:08.063]  And it told me two things, Alex.
[01:52:08.483 --> 01:52:14.228]  It told me that, first of all, embalmers, they want to tell you what they're seeing in the embalming room if
[01:52:15.009 --> 01:52:20.097]  If they think they have the permission of their funeral director boss or their state funeral director association.
[01:52:20.518 --> 01:52:25.326]  Ah, so what you're saying is you detected the associations that got in the word don't answer the survey.
[01:52:26.460 --> 01:52:26.680]  Right.
[01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:32.164]  Remember, I sent it to 29 other state associations, and what they did probably is deleted my email.
[01:52:32.404 --> 01:52:36.207]  They probably didn't forward it down to their funeral directors and bowlers to take in the first place.
[01:52:36.227 --> 01:52:36.728]  And that's key.
[01:52:36.788 --> 01:52:42.211]  You send the first survey out and get massive response across the board, but now the system was ready the next time.
[01:52:42.292 --> 01:52:42.552]  Wow.
[01:52:42.812 --> 01:52:45.414]  So that shows real premeditation by somebody.
[01:52:46.855 --> 01:52:52.499]  Yeah, and I have two reasons why I think that they failed or may have been reluctant, those 29 other states.
[01:52:53.129 --> 01:52:56.871]  Remember, a lot of these funeral director association presidents are funeral directors themselves.
[01:52:56.891 --> 01:52:59.733]  You know, they elect one of their own as the president of their state association.
[01:53:00.613 --> 01:53:16.063]  Well, would you want to participate in a survey if you think there's a link between the COVID-19 vaccines and these white fibrous cloths and microclotting and these other issues that we're going to talk about, if you mandated that all your employees of your funeral home, including your embalmer, take the COVID-19 vaccine?
[01:53:17.276 --> 01:53:17.797]  We're good to go.
[01:53:39.460 --> 01:53:39.700]  Right.
[01:53:40.100 --> 01:53:50.763]  The other reason I think maybe Alex is, according to the CDC, about 80% of American adults over the age of 18 took at least the first two COVID-19 vaccines back in 2021.
[01:53:51.383 --> 01:53:55.344]  So there might be a little cognitive dissonance going on with these funeral directors.
[01:53:55.704 --> 01:53:59.706]  They may not want to know the answer to the survey because they may have taken the vaccine themselves.
[01:53:59.726 --> 01:54:01.986]  So there might be some cognitive dissonance going on as well.
[01:54:02.046 --> 01:54:02.426]  That's right.
[01:54:02.446 --> 01:54:03.447]  Some Stockholm syndrome.
[01:54:03.467 --> 01:54:04.487]  They're sticking their head in the sand.
[01:54:04.527 --> 01:54:04.787]  Wow.
[01:54:05.087 --> 01:54:06.487]  So we're going to go to break here in a few minutes.
[01:54:06.507 --> 01:54:07.508]  We're going to do your PowerPoint.
[01:54:07.568 --> 01:54:08.588]  Tell us what you're going to present.
[01:54:10.683 --> 01:54:11.924]  And again, how do people find your amazing work?
[01:54:11.944 --> 01:54:13.865]  Well, the Children's Health Defense has done a wonderful article.
[01:54:13.885 --> 01:54:17.787]  That's the publication that comes out of, it's called The Defender, and it's Children's Health Defense.
[01:54:17.807 --> 01:54:18.347]  Oh, we love them.
[01:54:18.667 --> 01:54:19.068]  Also, I did the
[01:54:38.368 --> 01:54:46.976]  Yeah, I did a very good YouTube video with famous UK doctor John Campbell on the 7th of February that people can watch on YouTube.
[01:54:47.256 --> 01:54:51.520]  That's about an hour-long presentation where we go into detail about the results of the survey.
[01:54:51.540 --> 01:54:53.041]  And by the way, he's so respected.
[01:54:53.062 --> 01:54:54.303]  He admits he got conned.
[01:54:54.323 --> 01:54:55.604]  He admits there's mass death now.
[01:54:55.964 --> 01:54:57.726]  That guy reaches 10, 15 million people a week.
[01:54:57.746 --> 01:54:58.887]  They're really scared of him.
[01:55:00.410 --> 01:55:01.051]  Yes, they are.
[01:55:01.391 --> 01:55:13.120]  Because he actually, at the beginning of the whole thing, he was somewhat promoting the vaccines, and then when he started seeing the data go sideways, he had enough integrity to make the change over and say, hey, wait a minute, there's something wrong with these shots.
[01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:15.582]  They're actually killing and injuring millions around the world.
[01:55:15.842 --> 01:55:17.223]  So God bless John Campbell.
[01:55:17.483 --> 01:55:25.589]  Well, that's right, because I hear this thing where, oh, you know, Dr. Brett Weinstein's now on our side, or this person came over, and people are like, oh, they're a traitor, they were wrong.
[01:55:26.009 --> 01:55:29.692]  It takes more integrity morally to admit you're wrong later.
[01:55:29.712 --> 01:55:31.593]  That's a sign of integrity, not the opposite.
[01:55:31.833 --> 01:55:38.118]  We need to have a big tent and get people to admit they're wrong and let people in the system know they can come over to us so we can stop this.
[01:55:39.497 --> 01:55:40.257]  Amen, Alex.
[01:55:40.378 --> 01:55:40.858]  Exactly.
[01:55:40.898 --> 01:55:42.419]  We cannot throw those people aside.
[01:55:42.899 --> 01:55:44.720]  Because, you know, I understand they were duped.
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:50.262]  The powers that be were telling us the shot was safe and effective, and that mantra just caught people off guard.
[01:55:50.543 --> 01:55:51.283]  People trusted.
[01:55:51.323 --> 01:55:52.584]  They didn't want to kill Grandma.
[01:55:53.044 --> 01:55:55.345]  But, boy, they made a big mistake taking these shots.
[01:55:55.405 --> 01:55:55.665]  All right.
[01:55:55.705 --> 01:55:56.225]  Stay there, sir.
[01:55:56.245 --> 01:55:57.406]  We're going to break in about a minute.
[01:55:57.426 --> 01:56:00.868]  We're going to come back, and we've got a short little break that comes up.
[01:56:00.888 --> 01:56:01.808]  Some stations join us.
[01:56:02.229 --> 01:56:04.069]  But we are going to get right into your PowerPoint.
[01:56:04.410 --> 01:56:05.390]  This is so important.
[01:56:05.430 --> 01:56:08.071]  We'll also link up to the Dr. Campbell interview as well.
[01:56:08.111 --> 01:56:08.752]  Before we go to break.
[01:56:09.312 --> 01:56:10.774]  I'm not financed by globalists.
[01:56:10.834 --> 01:56:12.035]  I'm not financed by Soros.
[01:56:12.095 --> 01:56:14.818]  I'm not financed by the Mercers or billionaire Republicans.
[01:56:15.238 --> 01:56:16.259]  I'm financed by you.

[02:00:15.844 --> 02:00:16.604]  InfoWars.
[02:00:16.964 --> 02:00:18.525]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[02:00:20.913 --> 02:00:23.235]  You know, is there something to worry about with medicines?
[02:00:23.315 --> 02:00:25.376]  That is, might some of them have side effects?
[02:00:25.456 --> 02:00:26.797]  Do we need safety testing?
[02:00:26.817 --> 02:00:34.543]  I mean, we're taking things that are genetically modified organisms and we're injecting them in little kids' arms.
[02:00:34.563 --> 02:00:36.064]  We just shoot them right into the vein.
[02:01:03.818 --> 02:01:06.681]  I think.
[02:01:28.123 --> 02:01:28.683]  Look at that.
[02:01:28.863 --> 02:01:29.824]  Holy cow.
[02:01:29.864 --> 02:01:30.884]  Changed immediately.
[02:01:30.924 --> 02:01:31.285]  Didn't it?
[02:01:31.625 --> 02:01:31.865]  Yep.
[02:01:32.185 --> 02:01:32.926]  Holy cow.
[02:01:33.406 --> 02:01:34.887]  Instantly cleared.
[02:01:35.487 --> 02:01:36.647]  I've never seen anything do that.
[02:01:37.068 --> 02:01:38.949]  And I don't mean to sound sensational, I just... Right.
[02:01:39.189 --> 02:01:39.529]  I haven't.
[02:01:39.609 --> 02:01:40.429]  Never seen anything do that.
[02:01:40.710 --> 02:01:40.950]  Nope.
[02:01:41.050 --> 02:01:42.170]  Never seen anything do that.
[02:01:43.331 --> 02:01:46.192]  Look at that.
[02:01:46.813 --> 02:01:47.053]  Oh.
[02:01:47.253 --> 02:01:47.693]  Wow.
[02:01:47.713 --> 02:01:48.374]  Pfizer.
[02:01:48.394 --> 02:01:49.454]  That's the Pfizer, right?
[02:01:49.554 --> 02:01:50.455]  Oh, look at that.
[02:01:52.055 --> 02:01:54.497]  Okay, so we'll first take the normal one.
[02:01:55.586 --> 02:01:58.208]  This is the regular without anything on it.
[02:01:58.568 --> 02:01:58.809]  Yep.
[02:01:59.309 --> 02:02:05.173]  You can see little platelet clumps up in here throughout and then a couple of white cells in the background.
[02:02:05.193 --> 02:02:07.095]  Well, that looks pretty decent.
[02:02:07.755 --> 02:02:08.976]  Like you're going to live forever, Dale.
[02:02:09.076 --> 02:02:09.397]  All right.
[02:02:09.577 --> 02:02:10.197]  Good to know.
[02:02:11.678 --> 02:02:14.120]  All right, let's see what the Darinil looks like.
[02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:16.962]  So, again, we'll start kind of out at that thicker edge first.
[02:02:18.764 --> 02:02:22.707]  Work our way towards the thinner portion of the prep.
[02:02:23.424 --> 02:02:24.745]  The question is, where did all the cells go?
[02:02:25.225 --> 02:02:25.705]  Seriously.
[02:02:25.725 --> 02:02:27.266]  They're gone.
[02:02:29.547 --> 02:02:30.127]  Seriously.
[02:02:33.089 --> 02:02:37.211]  It pushed them back into a big giant clump over at the edged clump.
[02:02:38.717 --> 02:02:40.978]  And again, is that the charge on the particles?
[02:02:40.998 --> 02:02:41.518]  I don't know.
[02:02:42.438 --> 02:02:45.299]  But where we put that drop, there are no red cells there.
[02:02:45.319 --> 02:02:50.281]  I was going to say, as they come out, it's almost like they're bleaching clear.
[02:02:50.581 --> 02:02:56.703]  Bleaching clear, some of them are folded, and some are what we call crinulated, a little crinkled.
[02:02:57.203 --> 02:02:59.424]  But yeah, that whole edge is bleached.
[02:03:01.165 --> 02:03:01.785]  So this is the J&J.
[02:03:04.306 --> 02:03:05.667]  That's totally different.
[02:03:06.167 --> 02:03:07.908]  There's like a nuclear bomb went off.
[02:03:08.008 --> 02:03:09.269]  Yeah, it's disordered, isn't it?
[02:03:09.549 --> 02:03:13.811]  And then there's a little more of that stacking, that rouleau here.
[02:03:14.711 --> 02:03:17.272]  And again, look at all this clumping here out on the edge of it.
[02:03:17.332 --> 02:03:20.774]  It just, yeah, like you said, like a nuclear bomb went off.
[02:03:20.854 --> 02:03:21.715]  It just congealed it.
[02:03:22.628 --> 02:03:23.728]  And again, that's not spike.
[02:03:23.788 --> 02:03:25.449]  That's just the lipid nanoparticle.
[02:03:26.349 --> 02:03:31.411]  So these are becoming more spherical, and you're losing that donut in the middle of your red cell.
[02:03:31.591 --> 02:03:40.374]  What's happening here is slightly from the outside of the cell in, causing those cells to balloon up slightly, because now you've got a subtle osmotic shift here.
[02:03:40.854 --> 02:03:44.596]  And all of these are supposed to be, again, isotonic.
[02:03:44.616 --> 02:03:46.817]  These are supposed to be balanced with the pH of the body.
[02:03:46.937 --> 02:03:50.398]  You shouldn't be seeing this kind of reaction
[02:03:51.418 --> 02:03:57.741]  It shouldn't be damaging to the cells of the body right away like this.
[02:03:59.381 --> 02:04:01.102]  So here's that first visor.
[02:04:01.382 --> 02:04:04.884]  And these were the ones where we just put a drop on and the whole thing just cleared.
[02:04:07.745 --> 02:04:10.026]  This is where all that fluid went.
[02:04:12.447 --> 02:04:19.170]  And again, like that J&J, just caused immediate dispersion and clumping.
[02:04:20.305 --> 02:04:22.209]  And those don't look very red to me either.
[02:04:22.229 --> 02:04:22.269]  No.
[02:04:25.094 --> 02:04:25.695]  Oh, and look at this.
[02:04:25.715 --> 02:04:27.097]  Look at those little spikies.
[02:04:27.137 --> 02:04:28.500]  Those are called echinocytes.
[02:04:29.722 --> 02:04:34.445]  So it instantly changed the pH interior.
[02:04:34.826 --> 02:04:44.552]  These are little blubs of protein on the membrane of the red cell because the red cell has involuted, and then those proteins on the surface, they don't have room to go.
[02:04:44.572 --> 02:04:49.095]  It's like flattening a ball of some sort, and it's kind of all baggy.
[02:04:50.196 --> 02:04:52.577]  So all these little fingers, that is not spike protein.
[02:04:52.597 --> 02:04:54.379]  So that's another myth I want mine to spoil.
[02:04:54.439 --> 02:04:56.360]  I mean, it's crazy because it's done it to so many.
[02:04:56.380 --> 02:04:57.941]  We didn't see that on the other ones, right?
[02:04:59.124 --> 02:05:00.045]  Hello, Americans.
[02:05:00.845 --> 02:05:02.486]  I want to share with you a story.
[02:05:03.106 --> 02:05:09.250]  A story about inflammation, the silent menace that lurks within our bodies, affecting our health and well-being.
[02:05:10.430 --> 02:05:16.234]  Inflammation, the root cause of countless ailments, quietly wreaking havoc over time.
[02:05:17.294 --> 02:05:24.939]  Long-term exposure to inflammation has been linked to a myriad of health issues, from heart disease to arthritis, even cognitive decline.
[02:05:25.970 --> 02:05:33.597]  But fear not, for there's a beacon of hope found in the wisdom of nature, a remedy that has stood the test of time, turmeric.
[02:05:34.357 --> 02:05:38.661]  And now I present to you bodies from InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:05:39.984 --> 02:05:47.647]  A powerful blend crafted with precision-boasting 95% curcuminoids extracted from turmeric.
[02:05:47.747 --> 02:05:49.747]  It's good for your heart, your brain, everything.
[02:05:49.887 --> 02:05:51.588]  It is 40% off.
[02:05:51.708 --> 02:05:52.708]  Back in stock.
[02:05:52.828 --> 02:05:54.869]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.

[02:06:12.111 --> 02:06:18.134]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:18.474 --> 02:06:23.276]  All right, Tom Havilland has done an incredible service to humanity.
[02:06:23.337 --> 02:06:27.379]  He watched Died Suddenly a few years ago, and he is a...
[02:06:28.902 --> 02:06:31.024]  Former defense contractor and former U.S.
[02:06:31.184 --> 02:06:38.651]  Air Force major that did data analysis, and he went out and did surveys with the...
[02:06:40.615 --> 02:06:41.235]  We're good to go.
[02:07:04.864 --> 02:07:05.184]  Sure, Alex.
[02:07:05.224 --> 02:07:05.484]  Sure.
[02:07:32.697 --> 02:07:33.437]  Alex Jones Show!
[02:07:33.497 --> 02:07:34.458]  We're good to go.
[02:07:34.478 --> 02:07:34.778]  I think?
[02:07:52.179 --> 02:07:54.860]  I sent it off to the FDA.
[02:07:54.900 --> 02:08:01.063]  They had a meeting of their vaccine and related biological products advisory committee on the 26th of January of last year, 2023.
[02:08:01.103 --> 02:08:05.205]  And they actually had an hour set aside for oral presentations.
[02:08:05.265 --> 02:08:08.947]  I asked to speak at that meeting, but there was a lottery ensued.
[02:08:08.967 --> 02:08:10.268]  There was 20 speakers selected.
[02:08:10.348 --> 02:08:11.208]  I wasn't one of them.
[02:08:11.708 --> 02:08:17.251]  But I did submit my results in a written format, Alex, last year, about a full week before that meeting took place.
[02:08:18.147 --> 02:08:20.189]  And I did get a tracking number from the FDA.
[02:08:20.589 --> 02:08:25.473]  But throughout the entire year, Alex, I heard nothing from the FDA or the CDC.
[02:08:25.553 --> 02:08:25.933]  Crickets.
[02:08:26.574 --> 02:08:37.342]  So I'm not holding my breath this year, but as soon as I had the results of this current survey that we're about to see, I sent those off the very next day on the 9th of January to the FDA, CDC, and NIH.
[02:08:39.405 --> 02:08:41.967]  And hopes that they'll do something about it this year.
[02:08:42.267 --> 02:08:43.388]  But I'm not holding my breath.
[02:08:43.628 --> 02:08:51.674]  And it's not like you're doing this alone with your great background in data analysis with the Air Force and then with the defense contracting work.
[02:08:52.435 --> 02:08:59.260]  We have just huge articles, stories, epidemiologists, pathologists around the world talking about this phenomenon.
[02:08:59.300 --> 02:09:02.382]  We have giant stacks of studies saying it's causing blood clots.
[02:09:03.223 --> 02:09:03.403]  But...
[02:09:04.565 --> 02:09:04.765]  Okay.
[02:09:04.785 --> 02:09:04.845]  In...
[02:09:15.965 --> 02:09:19.268]  The first question we asked in the survey this year, by the way, was what state are you from?
[02:09:19.588 --> 02:09:22.290]  We allow the involvements to stay anonymous, but we want to know where they're from.
[02:09:22.310 --> 02:09:25.132]  One of the reasons why, Alex, is we want to check for regionality.
[02:09:25.453 --> 02:09:33.839]  There's the bad batch theory that maybe some batches were sent to, you know, bad batches were sent to some locations and other batches were clean sent to other locations.
[02:09:34.220 --> 02:09:40.225]  Unfortunately, we did not get enough responses to the survey to really determine anything about the bad batch theory.
[02:09:40.745 --> 02:09:44.088]  So if you go to the next slide, you'll see question two.
[02:09:45.134 --> 02:09:50.175]  We asked the embalmers, how long have you been an embalmer?
[02:09:50.755 --> 02:09:57.257]  And as you see there, the pretty long bar there at the bottom, most of the embalmers that responded to the survey have over 20 years of experience.
[02:09:57.617 --> 02:09:58.717]  And this is a great thing, right?
[02:09:58.737 --> 02:10:01.438]  They know what the blood looked like before the years of COVID.
[02:10:01.878 --> 02:10:05.899]  They know what it looked like in the year of COVID, 2020, but we had no vaccines yet.
[02:10:06.239 --> 02:10:12.801]  And then they also know what the blood looks like from 2021 to present when we had both the COVID virus and the vaccines.
[02:10:13.122 --> 02:10:14.085]  So this is a good thing.
[02:10:14.547 --> 02:10:16.172]  Average of 15 years experience.
[02:10:16.654 --> 02:10:17.076]  Next slide.
[02:10:19.434 --> 02:10:23.656]  We then asked the embalmers how many corpses do you normally embalm per year.
[02:10:24.096 --> 02:10:27.638]  As you see there, the average is about 100 corpses per year, two a week.
[02:10:28.539 --> 02:10:30.800]  Embalmers like Richard Hirschman, who you just had on the show.
[02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:33.041]  Richard is very prolific.
[02:10:33.081 --> 02:10:43.026]  He's a trade embalmer, so he contracts with about a dozen funeral homes, and he'll do well over 300 bodies a year or sometimes many more, and often two or three bodies a day.
[02:10:43.586 --> 02:10:48.469]  So these embalmers that respond to the survey, they know what they're seeing, and they know what dead bodies usually look like.
[02:10:49.082 --> 02:10:49.604]  Next slide.
[02:10:52.473 --> 02:10:53.778]  We then asked the embalmers...
[02:10:55.094 --> 02:10:58.215]  Did you see the white fibers clots in the year 2023?
[02:10:58.816 --> 02:11:00.356]  Look at that, Alex.
[02:11:01.137 --> 02:11:08.440]  197 of the 269 embalmers that responded to our survey, 73% are still seeing these white fibers clots in the year 2023.
[02:11:08.620 --> 02:11:14.842]  And that's about the same percentage as 2022 when about 67% said they saw the clots.
[02:11:15.282 --> 02:11:16.263]  So it's not a good thing.
[02:11:16.323 --> 02:11:24.146]  As we get further and further out from most people taking their last jabs in 2021, we're still seeing a lot of these white fibers clots the embalmers are.
[02:11:24.801 --> 02:11:25.301]  Next slide.
[02:11:27.863 --> 02:11:33.167]  So the next question we ask embalmers is, well, in what percentage of your corpses are you seeing these white fibrous clots?
[02:11:34.068 --> 02:11:34.168]  And...
[02:11:35.178 --> 02:11:35.979]  I think we're good to go.
[02:12:00.951 --> 02:12:01.591]  We're good to go.
[02:12:25.635 --> 02:12:30.659]  And as I said before, you know, embalmers have never seen this phenomenon prior to the years of COVID or the vaccines.
[02:12:31.439 --> 02:12:37.924]  If you look over there on the left, you'll see 48 of the embalmers saw the white fibrous clots between 21 to 40% of their corpses.
[02:12:38.684 --> 02:12:44.108]  Another 29 embalmers saw these white fibrous clots between 41 to 60% of their corpses.
[02:12:44.768 --> 02:12:48.951]  And there was 11 embalmers that saw these white fibrous clots between 61 to 80% of their corpses in 2023.
[02:12:52.054 --> 02:12:55.255]  So it's telling me this is not a rare phenomenon, Alex.
[02:12:55.335 --> 02:12:56.456]  These things are prevalent.
[02:12:58.196 --> 02:12:59.277]  You're absolutely right.
[02:12:59.457 --> 02:13:00.097]  Please continue.
[02:13:00.978 --> 02:13:01.218]  Yeah.
[02:13:01.538 --> 02:13:02.078]  Next slide.
[02:13:04.319 --> 02:13:12.962]  As Richard Hirschman mentioned, one of the other things we had the embalmers talk about with me this year is the phenomenon of microclotting.
[02:13:13.643 --> 02:13:15.163]  If you go to the next slide, you'll see that.
[02:13:18.124 --> 02:13:19.265]  I'm not seeing it on my screen.
[02:13:20.610 --> 02:13:21.311]  Question six.
[02:13:21.772 --> 02:13:22.392]  Back up one.
[02:13:25.436 --> 02:13:29.321]  We asked the... As the embalmers say, they don't call it microcloning, Alex.
[02:13:29.341 --> 02:13:35.168]  They call it what looks like coffee grounds or dirty blood and the drainage coming off the corpse as they're trying to put the formaldehyde in.
[02:13:35.708 --> 02:13:37.691]  Would you say they've never seen?
[02:13:37.711 --> 02:13:38.451]  I mean...
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:41.361]  They have seen a little bit in the past.
[02:13:41.421 --> 02:13:44.543]  It's very, very rare, but they have seen it in the past.
[02:13:44.843 --> 02:13:47.164]  But look at that number, Alex.
[02:13:47.184 --> 02:13:50.887]  212 embalmers out of the 269 that responded.
[02:13:51.267 --> 02:13:54.649]  79%, almost 80% of the embalmers saw this phenomenon in 2023.
[02:13:54.709 --> 02:13:56.971]  Sure, and I'm sure you're the expert.
[02:13:57.371 --> 02:13:58.051]  I was just going on.
[02:13:58.071 --> 02:14:02.094]  I've seen a lot of them on the Internet saying, I've been working 15 years, never seen this.
[02:14:02.114 --> 02:14:04.955]  But you're saying some have seen it, maybe guys that have worked 20 years, 30 years.
[02:14:06.564 --> 02:14:13.126]  Yeah, if you go to the next slide, you'll see I have a note there that says they've typically seen it in the past in less than 5% of their corpses.
[02:14:13.146 --> 02:14:14.847]  You see down there in the lower right-hand corner.
[02:14:15.247 --> 02:14:22.650]  And some of the embalmers I've talked to said they've seen it before in chemotherapy patients with heavy chemo when those corpses come in.
[02:14:23.550 --> 02:14:24.170]  We're good to go.
[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:55.982]  32 embalmers are seeing the dirty blood coffee grounds in 41 to 60% of their corpses.
[02:14:56.543 --> 02:15:01.465]  And there's 16 embalmers saw between 61 to 80% of their corpses.
[02:15:02.065 --> 02:15:04.826]  And this could be just as dangerous as those large white fibrous clots.
[02:15:05.246 --> 02:15:09.028]  As we said, it can block off the exchange of oxygen in the lungs.
[02:15:09.228 --> 02:15:11.008]  It happens at the small capillary levels.
[02:15:11.529 --> 02:15:14.410]  And then they carry that oxygen to all the major organs of the body.
[02:15:14.430 --> 02:15:17.371]  But if a tiny one gets in your brain, you're going to have a stroke.
[02:15:19.089 --> 02:15:20.390]  They can definitely lead to stroke.
[02:15:20.530 --> 02:15:22.471]  They also can lead to things like brain fog.
[02:15:22.911 --> 02:15:27.293]  There's no wonder people might be having brain fog if they're not getting enough oxygen going to their brains.
[02:15:27.753 --> 02:15:37.016]  A lot of people are also having trouble with their eyesight, and we know there's a lot of small capillaries that feed the eyes, and if it's being blocked by this microclotting, it can cause blindness or impaired vision.
[02:15:37.937 --> 02:15:39.117]  So it's a serious problem.
[02:15:39.938 --> 02:15:40.438]  Next slide.
[02:15:44.319 --> 02:15:44.960]  One of the things the...
[02:15:46.647 --> 02:15:47.187]  We're good to go.
[02:15:47.207 --> 02:15:47.468]  I think?
[02:16:03.519 --> 02:16:03.639]  Yeah.
[02:16:33.718 --> 02:16:38.262]  So, Involver said they saw the grape jelly clots in 40% of the corpses this year.
[02:16:38.562 --> 02:16:42.285]  They also said that they're more like grape jam than grape jelly.
[02:16:42.305 --> 02:16:42.885]  They're thicker.
[02:16:42.905 --> 02:16:47.529]  And that's been that way since the rollout of the vaccines as well.
[02:16:48.189 --> 02:16:54.254]  So then our next question, if you go to the next slide, you'll see, well, what was it prior to the years of COVID and the vaccines?
[02:16:55.715 --> 02:16:59.657]  If you go to question nine, you'll see that the percentage was 30%.
[02:17:00.677 --> 02:17:08.121]  So they did see grape jelly clots before the years of the pandemic in about 30% of the corpses, but that's risen now to about 40% of the corpses.
[02:17:09.802 --> 02:17:13.783]  And we'll put slide nine up there, but let me just stop for a moment.
[02:17:14.604 --> 02:17:18.285]  We'll hear about one rabies case in a kitten, and it's national news.
[02:17:18.305 --> 02:17:23.488]  We'll hear about some new smallpox that killed one guy in August.
[02:17:25.379 --> 02:17:37.809]  Alaska, and it's top news, but then we have over half the embalmers saying they're seeing a clot they've never seen, and we have the CDC admitting these shots cause blood clots, and it's crickets from the media.
[02:17:37.849 --> 02:17:39.711]  That is unprecedented.
[02:17:39.731 --> 02:17:46.757]  I mean, that is such a scandal that there's some little thing pops up, it's all over the news, but something massive, we're not supposed to talk about it.
[02:17:47.961 --> 02:17:49.042]  It is shocking, isn't it?
[02:17:49.082 --> 02:17:52.664]  Because we've got, like you say, we've got this brand new thing of these white fibers clots.
[02:17:53.204 --> 02:17:56.526]  We've got five times as much microcloning as we've ever seen before.
[02:17:56.967 --> 02:18:01.329]  We've got a rise in grape jelly clots from 30% to 40% of corpses.
[02:18:02.110 --> 02:18:04.071]  And that's all happening together.
[02:18:04.751 --> 02:18:06.832]  It's horrific what's going on, Alex.
[02:18:07.132 --> 02:18:07.513]  And you know what?
[02:18:07.553 --> 02:18:11.435]  I think it's actually caused a lot of psychological damage for the embalmers seeing this horror story.
[02:18:12.035 --> 02:18:13.836]  Because they're afraid to speak out.
[02:18:14.196 --> 02:18:17.158]  They've seen what happens if doctors speak out against the vaccines.
[02:18:17.538 --> 02:18:20.880]  They've seen them getting their licenses pulled, their certifications taken away from them.
[02:18:21.460 --> 02:18:23.341]  And they don't want to rock the boat for their funeral home.
[02:18:23.361 --> 02:18:25.042]  They want to keep their jobs, you know?
[02:18:25.754 --> 02:18:30.181]  And like I said, they may be in a bad position because maybe their employer mandated they get the jabs.
[02:18:30.661 --> 02:18:32.745]  So it's just a horrific situation.
[02:18:33.245 --> 02:18:41.418]  And I'm very thankful to the embalmers that did speak out, the 269 that did take the survey, people like Richard Hirschman, John O'Looney.
[02:18:42.459 --> 02:18:48.344]  The embalmers that came out very early on this and have a good conscience to try to warn the American public and the people of the world.
[02:18:48.905 --> 02:18:49.545]  Absolutely.
[02:18:50.006 --> 02:18:55.171]  They've got a soul, and it's a worldwide UN treaty, biomedical takeover.
[02:18:55.451 --> 02:18:59.395]  I saw earlier when I had the other guest on, Richard Hirschman, I was talking about
[02:19:00.644 --> 02:19:06.165]  The individual you just mentioned in Australia, and you were nodding your head at how they're censoring him.
[02:19:06.185 --> 02:19:09.546]  I mean, they are really trying to shut this down right now.
[02:19:09.946 --> 02:19:13.386]  And, of course, I'm talking about... John O'Looney.
[02:19:13.566 --> 02:19:15.327]  John O'Looney.
[02:19:15.467 --> 02:19:21.628]  The British Institute of Embalmers has actually sent out an email to their membership saying they are not to communicate with John O'Looney.
[02:19:22.268 --> 02:19:22.428]  Wow.
[02:19:22.448 --> 02:19:24.368]  Who's a member of the British Institute of Embalmers.
[02:19:24.829 --> 02:19:25.769]  Yeah.
[02:19:26.009 --> 02:19:27.129]  It's horrific what's happening.
[02:19:27.668 --> 02:19:34.090]  And there's tremendous suppression for reasons we talked about before the break, but it's something else.
[02:19:35.630 --> 02:19:39.631]  Another thing we asked in the survey, by the way, John, going back, yeah, if we go to the next question.
[02:19:40.712 --> 02:19:40.892]  Yes.
[02:19:40.912 --> 02:19:47.194]  The embalmers have told us that they're seeing a phenomenon of more infant deaths now, and this is a really sad area, right?
[02:19:47.654 --> 02:19:51.235]  I guess the good news is the no bars, you can see there's longer, 69 of the...
[02:19:53.065 --> 02:19:59.526]  69% of the embalmers said they did not see an increase in infant deaths in the year 2023 compared to the years before COVID.
[02:19:59.886 --> 02:20:01.447]  But there were 21% who did.
[02:20:01.467 --> 02:20:11.709]  And I think one of the reasons why that yellow bar is fairly long is some of the embalmers have told me, Alex, that there seem to be more cremations of infants these days than ever before.
[02:20:12.209 --> 02:20:18.150]  And so if there's any evidence of clotting or any problems in the child, then that evidence obviously is being destroyed with a cremation.
[02:20:19.022 --> 02:20:27.188]  Also, the hospitals these days... Yeah, let's slow down and talk about that, because while you've been talking, Tom Haviland, data analyst for me with the Pentagon...
[02:20:27.978 --> 02:20:34.779]  I literally have five stacks of studies and CDC admissions and FDA admissions that it causes clots.
[02:20:34.819 --> 02:20:35.840]  So let's just get this straight.
[02:20:36.580 --> 02:20:39.080]  They pulled the J&J shot years ago because of clotting.
[02:20:39.540 --> 02:20:40.901]  That is not debatable.
[02:20:41.221 --> 02:20:42.881]  We're not up here speculating.
[02:20:43.581 --> 02:20:49.003]  We're just simply covering the magnitude of these new forms of clots and the huge death we're seeing.
[02:20:49.063 --> 02:20:52.243]  So while you're talking, we'll continue with your PowerPoint.
[02:20:52.483 --> 02:20:55.364]  I'm going to be showing some of these articles.
[02:20:55.404 --> 02:20:55.644]  Go ahead.
[02:20:56.789 --> 02:20:57.409]  Yeah, because you're right.
[02:20:57.529 --> 02:21:04.874]  In April of 2021, they temporarily paused the J&J shot for blood clotting issues, particularly with pregnant women.
[02:21:05.354 --> 02:21:14.080]  But strangely, Alex, they brought that shot back just a few weeks later, and they let people continue to take that J&J shot through the rest of 2021 until they finally then, in I think May of 2022...
[02:21:19.583 --> 02:21:20.004]  Please continue.
[02:21:43.723 --> 02:21:44.844]  Yeah.
[02:21:45.344 --> 02:21:55.914]  So the next natural question we asked for the 20% of the embalmers who said that they did see the increase in infant deaths in 2023 compared to the years prior to COVID.
[02:21:56.214 --> 02:21:57.575]  You go to the next slide, question 11.
[02:21:58.576 --> 02:22:09.445]  You'll see that if you average all those bars together, except for the blue bar, if you start with the yellow bar and go down and average all those together, it becomes a 25% increase in infant deaths in 2023 compared
[02:22:12.437 --> 02:22:17.720]  Compared to the pre-COVID years, for just those, that 20% of embalmers who did see the increase.
[02:22:18.160 --> 02:22:20.062]  So that's alarming in and of itself, right, Alex?
[02:22:20.182 --> 02:22:20.902]  That's incredible.
[02:22:20.922 --> 02:22:23.023]  A 1% should be investigated.
[02:22:23.083 --> 02:22:31.208]  And then I look at the New England Journal of Medicine two years ago, found in the first two trimesters an 80-plus percent increase in miscarriage.
[02:22:31.688 --> 02:22:34.089]  Though the baby gets tougher and bigger, it still lives.
[02:22:34.510 --> 02:22:36.071]  But a lot of times it dies after.
[02:22:36.191 --> 02:22:37.271]  I mean, you look at this.
[02:22:37.331 --> 02:22:38.012]  This is just...
[02:22:38.952 --> 02:22:40.513]  I get why people can't face this.
[02:22:40.593 --> 02:22:41.954]  It's so astounding.
[02:22:42.014 --> 02:22:44.136]  It's so Hitlerian.
[02:22:44.196 --> 02:22:46.197]  It's so over the top.
[02:22:46.277 --> 02:22:47.398]  It's just hard to process.
[02:22:48.759 --> 02:22:59.006]  Yeah, and Dr. James Thorpe, as you see, he's been tracking this as OBGYN, and he's seen just a tremendous increase in miscarriages, fetal demises, stillborns, SIDS.
[02:22:59.567 --> 02:23:00.387]  It's just horrific.
[02:23:00.787 --> 02:23:07.092]  And as we know, they have found the spike protein from the vaccine in the mother's breast milk going from the mother to the infant.
[02:23:07.512 --> 02:23:14.256]  They've also found the spike protein from the vaccine and delivered placentas that the woman delivers after she delivers the child.
[02:23:14.656 --> 02:23:21.580]  So it seems pretty clear that the vaccine, spike protein from the vaccine, is getting through from the mother to the infant.
[02:23:21.600 --> 02:23:22.861]  So this is just disastrous.
[02:23:24.022 --> 02:23:26.523]  And then on top of it, they want to vaccinate your six-month-old.
[02:23:27.023 --> 02:23:28.664]  So it's just horrific what's going on.
[02:23:30.045 --> 02:23:32.767]  So the last question we asked this year was question 12.
[02:23:35.067 --> 02:23:40.652]  We didn't get a chance last year, Alex, to ask about age stratification, so we made that a point to do that this year.
[02:23:41.152 --> 02:23:53.943]  So we asked the embalmers, have you seen an increase in any type of clot, whether it's grape jelly, white fibrous, or microclotting, in the year 2023 for any particular age groups, plural?
[02:23:54.223 --> 02:23:57.886]  So this particular question, we allow them to mark multiple answers here.
[02:23:59.092 --> 02:24:00.353]  For all the groups they saw that in.
[02:24:00.853 --> 02:24:04.416]  No surprise here that the longest bars are for the elderly age groups.
[02:24:04.436 --> 02:24:07.698]  You see the longest bar there for the 66- to 80-year-old group.
[02:24:07.998 --> 02:24:14.722]  And you expect that as people get older, you start to have plat problems, cholesterol buildup in their vascular system.
[02:24:15.283 --> 02:24:18.545]  But what disturbs me, Alex, is that 36- to 50-year-old bar.
[02:24:18.645 --> 02:24:19.686]  That's a pretty long bar.
[02:24:19.986 --> 02:24:24.689]  89 of the embalmers said they saw an increase of clotting in that particular age group.
[02:24:25.209 --> 02:24:31.915]  And what's interesting about this is it dovetails very closely with the work from Edward Dow of the insurance data.
[02:24:32.235 --> 02:24:40.242]  He's taken a close look at the UK and USA death and disability data, and he has seen a tremendous increase in that particular age group.
[02:24:40.842 --> 02:24:51.251]  It basically exploded, Alex, in the year 2021, in the third quarter of 2021, when the vaccines were mandated by a lot of workers in that particular age group.
[02:24:51.852 --> 02:25:01.197]  So the information I'm getting from the answer from the embalmers is dovetailing very closely with the death and disability data that's been collected by Edward Dowd.
[02:25:01.217 --> 02:25:04.439]  Absolutely.
[02:25:04.479 --> 02:25:10.542]  People in that 36- to 50-year-old age group, Alex, you don't normally associate them with having heart attacks and strokes at that age.
[02:25:10.863 --> 02:25:14.665]  Usually you don't start having heart attacks and strokes until you're in your late 50s, early 60s.
[02:25:15.025 --> 02:25:19.347]  But we're seeing a lot more died suddenlies in that category of 36- to 50-year-olds.
[02:25:19.667 --> 02:25:20.728]  This is quite alarming.
[02:25:21.403 --> 02:25:21.583]  Yeah.
[02:25:21.904 --> 02:25:22.845]  Let me ask you this.
[02:25:22.865 --> 02:25:27.049]  We're going to have another guest popping in with a shotgun with us.
[02:25:28.170 --> 02:25:36.179]  As an American, as just a patriot, what do you think is really all behind this and what can we do to stop it?
[02:25:36.219 --> 02:25:37.901]  Because they're coming back with a U.N.
[02:25:38.081 --> 02:25:40.764]  treaty to take over medical care, our countries, our bodies.
[02:25:42.045 --> 02:25:49.788]  Tedros just said last week at the World Government Summit, the head of the WHO, that more diseases are coming, you better give in to us.
[02:25:49.968 --> 02:25:58.430]  This is so obviously a depopulation plan, but also about corrupting the medical system so they'll follow orders in the future.
[02:25:58.450 --> 02:26:03.012]  And I understand the horror is extreme, so people have trouble dealing with this, but...
[02:26:03.972 --> 02:26:06.453]  The horror of going along with this is far worse.
[02:26:07.053 --> 02:26:08.374]  How do you see this playing out?
[02:26:08.454 --> 02:26:09.234]  What can we do?
[02:26:09.715 --> 02:26:10.695]  You're a man of action.
[02:26:10.975 --> 02:26:11.856]  What should we do next?
[02:26:13.376 --> 02:26:17.238]  Well, you know, CDC and FDA have failed us.
[02:26:17.258 --> 02:26:22.100]  They're supposed to protect the American citizens, and they've just been a rubber stamp for big pharma on these products.
[02:26:22.640 --> 02:26:28.603]  Our Congress has let us down, with the exception of a few people like Marjorie Taylor Greene, Senator Ron Johnson, Rand Paul.
[02:26:28.763 --> 02:26:30.864]  Just a few have made this a big issue.
[02:26:31.647 --> 02:26:35.149]  So I always tell people, you know what, you're the last line of defense, the citizen.
[02:26:35.189 --> 02:26:36.930]  You just have to say no to these products.
[02:26:37.711 --> 02:26:40.232]  And that's why I'm calling for a moratorium on them.
[02:26:40.933 --> 02:26:47.176]  I think they're not safe and effective, and I think the data clearly shows that, and that we need to pull back.
[02:26:47.376 --> 02:26:53.440]  And what's really shocking, Alex, is they're getting ready to pump out a whole bunch of these mRNA-based drugs
[02:26:53.900 --> 02:26:54.641]  We're good to go.
[02:27:09.223 --> 02:27:12.485]  And, you know, not just hundreds of millions of people, but actually billions of arms.
[02:27:12.606 --> 02:27:13.166]  Well, that's right.
[02:27:13.246 --> 02:27:18.750]  Bill Gates, along with Fauci and others, went on a bunch of C-SPAN shows in 2016, 17, 18, 19.
[02:27:19.910 --> 02:27:23.072]  And they said, we're going to use a new virus out of China.
[02:27:23.092 --> 02:27:24.533]  I played the clip, folks, many times.
[02:27:25.214 --> 02:27:29.457]  And we're going to blow up the old regulatory system and just have vaccines made to order.
[02:27:29.517 --> 02:27:34.020]  But then they changed the definition of vaccine to anything we put in your body.
[02:27:34.540 --> 02:27:35.801]  So, yeah, this is a revolution.
[02:27:37.062 --> 02:27:37.882]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[02:27:38.502 --> 02:27:41.923]  And people may be asking themselves, well, I'm not seeing a bunch of excess mortality.
[02:27:42.464 --> 02:27:46.305]  There's been about 10% excess mortality in highly vaccinated countries.
[02:27:46.325 --> 02:27:48.845]  I have to expect that he's gone down for the first time in 100 years.
[02:27:49.886 --> 02:27:55.968]  What's strange about it, Alex, is we don't see any excess mortality in the African countries where they had very little uptake on the jab.
[02:27:56.228 --> 02:27:57.448]  That should tell people something.
[02:27:58.058 --> 02:28:02.319]  But people on their daily life, they probably don't see this 10% excess mortality.
[02:28:02.359 --> 02:28:03.099]  It's very subtle.
[02:28:03.619 --> 02:28:06.660]  Here in the United States, we're a country of 300 million people.
[02:28:07.040 --> 02:28:09.800]  About 3 million of us died every year before the pandemic.
[02:28:10.260 --> 02:28:15.501]  So a 10% excess mortality we've had the last three years is 10% of 3 million people.
[02:28:15.721 --> 02:28:18.222]  Well, that's 300,000 extra people dying a year.
[02:28:18.862 --> 02:28:24.283]  But at the individual level, you see maybe 11 people dying this year as opposed to 10.
[02:28:24.783 --> 02:28:26.503]  That's 10% excess mortality too.
[02:28:27.210 --> 02:28:31.693]  Are you really going to notice 11 people dying this year versus 10 dying last year?
[02:28:32.133 --> 02:28:32.994]  Probably not, right?
[02:28:33.474 --> 02:28:40.779]  But when you aggregate that 10% up to large populations, you wind up with 300,000 extra Americans dying every year.
[02:28:41.219 --> 02:28:42.220]  That's what's happening here.
[02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:47.944]  That's why it's subtle at the individual level, but on the mass population level, it's huge.
[02:28:48.885 --> 02:28:51.046]  All right, Tom Haviland, stay right there.
[02:28:51.066 --> 02:28:52.427]  We'll be back in a few minutes.
[02:28:52.947 --> 02:28:54.969]  We have another guest that's witnessed this joining us.
[02:28:55.009 --> 02:28:55.369]  Stay with us.
[02:28:57.861 --> 02:28:58.781]  Hello, Americans.
[02:28:59.582 --> 02:29:01.183]  I want to share with you a story.
[02:29:01.843 --> 02:29:08.106]  A story about inflammation, the silent menace that lurks within our bodies, affecting our health and well-being.
[02:29:09.166 --> 02:29:14.949]  Inflammation, the root cause of countless ailments, quietly wreaking havoc over time.
[02:29:16.029 --> 02:29:23.673]  Long-term exposure to inflammation has been linked to a myriad of health issues, from heart disease to arthritis, even cognitive decline.
[02:29:24.710 --> 02:29:32.277]  But fear not, for there's a beacon of hope found in the wisdom of nature, a remedy that has stood the test of time, turmeric.
[02:29:33.078 --> 02:29:46.402]  And now I present to you Baudis from Infowarsstore.com, a powerful blend crafted with precision, boasting 95% curcuminoids extracted from turmeric.
[02:29:46.522 --> 02:29:48.483]  It's good for your heart, your brain, everything.
[02:29:48.623 --> 02:29:56.186]  It is 40% off, back in stock, Baudis Ultimate Turmeric Formula, Infowarsstore.com.
[02:29:57.782 --> 02:30:00.063]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[02:30:00.223 --> 02:30:00.583]  Thank you.
[02:30:00.764 --> 02:30:03.325]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[02:30:03.385 --> 02:30:04.646]  I started taking that stuff.
[02:30:04.686 --> 02:30:07.887]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[02:30:07.947 --> 02:30:08.908]  When did you start taking it?
[02:30:09.168 --> 02:30:13.030]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure, and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[02:30:13.050 --> 02:30:13.330]  Mm-hmm.
[02:30:13.811 --> 02:30:14.011]  Mm-hmm.
[02:30:14.031 --> 02:30:14.211]  Mm-hmm.
[02:30:30.009 --> 02:30:30.970]  I think we're good to go.
[02:30:57.725 --> 02:31:01.247]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[02:31:01.647 --> 02:31:08.670]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[02:31:08.850 --> 02:31:10.831]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[02:31:11.031 --> 02:31:12.112]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[02:31:12.152 --> 02:31:12.812]  He loved the idea.
[02:31:13.152 --> 02:31:16.654]  What would you call the debate and discussion about a pro-human future?
[02:31:16.694 --> 02:31:17.575]  Just Team Humanity?
[02:31:17.635 --> 02:31:18.515]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[02:31:18.675 --> 02:31:19.116]  Absolutely.
[02:31:19.436 --> 02:31:20.837]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[02:31:20.897 --> 02:31:24.359]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[02:31:24.559 --> 02:31:32.023]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to give info on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[02:31:32.283 --> 02:31:33.404]  I want to thank you all for your passion.
[02:31:33.404 --> 02:31:37.965]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[02:31:58.250 --> 02:32:03.694]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[02:32:04.454 --> 02:32:08.737]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[02:32:09.137 --> 02:32:13.519]  We finally have a limited run back in supply at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:32:14.940 --> 02:32:17.722]  So many people have serious issues.
[02:32:18.003 --> 02:32:19.123]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[02:32:19.564 --> 02:32:24.988]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[02:32:25.508 --> 02:32:30.932]  Most of their iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[02:32:31.553 --> 02:32:34.455]  But this is pure atomic certified iodine.
[02:32:36.207 --> 02:32:37.508]  I don't know.
[02:32:37.608 --> 02:32:40.210]  X2 is now back in stock, discounted.
[02:32:40.530 --> 02:32:43.733]  So I'm giving Thanksgiving right now for this product being here.
[02:32:44.073 --> 02:32:49.177]  It funds the InfoWar, but I guarantee you, you take this for a few weeks, you will feel the difference.
[02:32:49.337 --> 02:32:50.137]  It is amazing.
[02:32:50.458 --> 02:32:56.462]  It's the missing link, X2, back in stock at the end of 2023 at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:32:56.882 --> 02:32:57.283]  X2.
[02:32:59.804 --> 02:33:05.689]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:11.417 --> 02:33:15.880]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:33:16.440 --> 02:33:17.941]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.265 --> 02:33:27.526]  You know, this is not an entertainment show.
[02:33:27.546 --> 02:33:28.447]  It's not a sports show.
[02:33:28.467 --> 02:33:30.088]  It's not a Netflix review show.
[02:33:31.088 --> 02:33:32.229]  I'm living here in the real world.
[02:33:34.210 --> 02:33:40.374]  We're pathologists, coroners, undertakers, embalmers.
[02:33:42.017 --> 02:33:44.478]  All over the world are coming out and saying we're seeing things we've never seen.
[02:33:44.498 --> 02:33:45.438]  We're seeing mass death.
[02:33:45.838 --> 02:33:46.739]  We're seeing record death.
[02:33:46.759 --> 02:33:51.881]  We have the insurance company actuaries and we have whistleblowers out of the New Zealand government at the highest levels.
[02:33:52.601 --> 02:33:54.822]  And I'm just sitting back knowing this is happening.
[02:33:56.109 --> 02:33:56.869]  And it's surreal.
[02:33:57.850 --> 02:34:00.611]  Because the average person just thinks, oh, this show is just another view.
[02:34:00.672 --> 02:34:03.073]  It's some guy on the radio talking about all this.
[02:34:03.153 --> 02:34:05.514]  No, this is 100% real.
[02:34:05.574 --> 02:34:14.919]  The miscarriages, the turbo cancers, the drop in longevity in how long we live.
[02:34:15.860 --> 02:34:16.920]  This is all real.
[02:34:16.980 --> 02:34:17.601]  Tom Havilland?
[02:34:19.242 --> 02:34:19.962]  Spent 20 years in the U.S.
[02:34:20.022 --> 02:34:29.967]  Air Force, retired as a major, a defense contractor in data analysis, saw this, said, I'm going to check it out, made phone calls, then did studies.
[02:34:31.195 --> 02:34:32.636]  What the hell's going on here?
[02:34:58.635 --> 02:35:01.936]  Yeah, as I said earlier, you are the last line of defense.
[02:35:02.396 --> 02:35:14.499]  One of the stories I had, one of the embalmers from the Die Suddenly movie is both a funeral director and an embalmer, similar to the gentleman I told you earlier about who's the president now of the Ohio Embalmers Association.
[02:35:15.259 --> 02:35:17.860]  And this woman who runs this other funeral home
[02:35:18.867 --> 02:35:28.360]  Said that whenever she finds the clots, Alex, she always asks the family of the deceased, hey, did your loved one happen to take the COVID-19 vaccine?
[02:35:28.841 --> 02:35:33.207]  And she says, 100% of the time, Alex, without fail, the answer is yes.
[02:35:34.079 --> 02:35:35.920]  So I know that's just one person.
[02:35:35.980 --> 02:35:46.004]  It's anecdotal, but it's a pretty shocking thing to discover and further prove that I think it's primarily the vaccines that are causing this phenomenon.
[02:35:46.024 --> 02:35:56.528]  Because most of the embalmers said they did not start seeing this phenomenon until 2021, in the middle of that year, about six months after the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines.
[02:35:57.288 --> 02:35:59.229]  And let's be clear.
[02:35:59.449 --> 02:35:59.909]  Let's be clear.
[02:35:59.949 --> 02:36:01.450]  I asked the crew to find it just seconds ago.
[02:36:02.390 --> 02:36:15.086]  Remember all the pharmacists that every drug they ever had, whether it was Valium, whether it was steroids, whether it was opioids, every drug has a data sheet that comes with it.
[02:36:15.426 --> 02:36:16.047]  They opened it up.
[02:36:16.067 --> 02:36:17.149]  It was totally blank.
[02:36:19.178 --> 02:36:20.599]  Yeah, they didn't want to tell you what was in the vaccine.
[02:36:20.959 --> 02:36:25.803]  And they also don't want to tell you, they don't want to give us the vaccination data of these people either that passed away.
[02:36:25.823 --> 02:36:34.109]  It'd be nice for us to see the people that we find the white fibrous clots in and then compare that to their vaccination records.
[02:36:34.489 --> 02:36:34.890]  We're good to go.
[02:36:34.910 --> 02:36:35.150]  I think?
[02:36:53.689 --> 02:36:59.676]  They see that the vaccines are causing this death and destruction, then it implicates them as the people who actually promoted the vaccines.
[02:37:00.036 --> 02:37:01.799]  So that's part of the problem here as well.
[02:37:02.620 --> 02:37:03.621]  It's not a good situation.
[02:37:03.661 --> 02:37:04.342]  No, I agree, Tom.
[02:37:04.382 --> 02:37:05.142]  Here's the problem.
[02:37:05.905 --> 02:37:06.165]  I don't know.
[02:37:25.680 --> 02:37:28.822]  Or Alpha's weakness is that we will just move on from an attack.
[02:37:29.363 --> 02:37:35.206]  Well, as you said, they're planning global treaties, taking over our bodies, all these new poison shots.
[02:37:35.627 --> 02:37:48.215]  We've got to realize we're the victims of a giant, megalomaniacal, mad scientist bio-war, and we better get upset about this to stop the next event, not reorganize, move forward.
[02:37:48.235 --> 02:37:52.278]  That's a good adaptive thing in humans, but that's in our previous development.
[02:37:52.298 --> 02:37:55.100]  We've got to recognize this was just a probe.
[02:37:56.364 --> 02:38:03.495]  It's like if aliens flew by and blew up Chicago or blew up Moscow or blew up Tokyo, we wouldn't just say, oh, well, they're not coming back.
[02:38:03.555 --> 02:38:05.298]  We'd mobilize to deal with it if they came back.
[02:38:05.619 --> 02:38:10.266]  We've just been hit with a major test, and we need to get ready for the next big attack.
[02:38:11.775 --> 02:38:13.076]  You're right, Alex.
[02:38:13.316 --> 02:38:16.537]  Unfortunately, I think Americans pretty much failed that test the first time.
[02:38:16.978 --> 02:38:21.300]  Eighty percent of the people, they bought in and they actually took the vaccines.
[02:38:21.620 --> 02:38:23.601]  The good news is, Alex, is they're waking up.
[02:38:23.621 --> 02:38:28.163]  Like I said, only 20 percent of people took the bivalent Omicron booster in the fall of 2022.
[02:38:29.424 --> 02:38:30.064]  We're good to go.
[02:38:48.511 --> 02:38:51.896]  And now these white fibers clots as well in this micro-clotting.
[02:38:52.356 --> 02:38:53.317]  No, I agree.
[02:38:53.358 --> 02:38:54.879]  We're winning the hearts and minds.
[02:38:54.940 --> 02:38:55.921]  So you're a smart cookie.
[02:38:55.941 --> 02:38:56.742]  You only go off data.
[02:38:56.762 --> 02:38:57.122]  I get that.
[02:38:57.142 --> 02:39:00.026]  But speculate as an American, as a veteran, as a patriot.
[02:39:00.587 --> 02:39:01.288]  You're a smart guy.
[02:39:01.688 --> 02:39:02.950]  The globalists aren't going to give up.
[02:39:03.290 --> 02:39:04.812]  What do you think they're going to try next now?
[02:39:05.133 --> 02:39:05.974]  And then what do we do?
[02:39:07.651 --> 02:39:14.760]  Well, you know, they've already talked about disease X. They've talked about it possibly being more lethal than the COVID.
[02:39:15.140 --> 02:39:24.331]  COVID actually, I think, wound up killing about a case fatality rate of about 0.3%, which was much less than the 3% or 4% they were telling us when the pandemic kicked off.
[02:39:24.531 --> 02:39:26.674]  They used that fear to get people to take the shots.
[02:39:27.194 --> 02:39:29.856]  And it wound up that they were off by a factor of 10.
[02:39:29.916 --> 02:39:33.077]  The actual case fatality rate is only about 0.3%.
[02:39:33.277 --> 02:39:37.420]  And I think a lot of that was probably due to lousy medical treatment.
[02:39:37.560 --> 02:39:44.343]  They had denied ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine early on, and also the hospital protocols stink as well.
[02:39:44.643 --> 02:39:49.246]  They put you on remdesivir, then slap you on a ventilator, and you had a 50-50 chance of living or dying.
[02:39:49.953 --> 02:39:52.315]  I'm very disappointed in the medical system.
[02:39:53.897 --> 02:39:55.398]  I think they're captured too, Alex.
[02:39:55.418 --> 02:39:57.080]  They've got a whole system of carrots and sticks.
[02:39:57.620 --> 02:40:05.868]  The Anthem Blue Shield, for example, they'll pay doctors who get 75% of their patients to take the vaccine
[02:40:06.668 --> 02:40:11.051]  $250 per injection for every injection they get.
[02:40:12.112 --> 02:40:15.774]  My wife asked me the other day, she said, why is Walgreens giving free flu shots?
[02:40:15.794 --> 02:40:16.374]  I go, they're not.
[02:40:16.594 --> 02:40:17.675]  It's a federal program.
[02:40:18.015 --> 02:40:19.216]  These people are being paid.
[02:40:19.316 --> 02:40:27.501]  I saw a number for every 200 and something kids that a pediatrician gives them the COVID shot, they get like $100,000.
[02:40:27.841 --> 02:40:31.003]  This is crazy.
[02:40:31.083 --> 02:40:32.544]  This is a bounty.
[02:40:32.564 --> 02:40:34.145]  They're not doing this because they love us.
[02:40:35.447 --> 02:40:37.707]  Yeah, and then there's also on the other end, there's sticks, right?
[02:40:37.988 --> 02:40:44.449]  If you speak up and talk anything negative about the vaccines, they'll have their licenses pulled, their board certifications taken away from them.
[02:40:45.009 --> 02:40:47.710]  So they're in a system that's corrupt.
[02:40:48.070 --> 02:40:59.632]  And, you know, people are probably coming in with vaccine injuries, and they're being gaslit and said, hey, it's something else, it's all in your head, or they try to diagnose it as something else, anything but the vaccine, you know?
[02:41:00.293 --> 02:41:05.657]  But I think a lot of these doctors need to grow a conscience and start coming out and speaking out about what they're seeing.
[02:41:05.898 --> 02:41:11.742]  Because we know they're seeing what people are reporting when they go in with all these complications and injuries from the vaccines.
[02:41:12.463 --> 02:41:12.923]  I agree.
[02:41:13.003 --> 02:41:13.504]  Incredible.
[02:41:13.764 --> 02:41:15.105]  You're a hard guy to get a hold of.
[02:41:15.165 --> 02:41:16.406]  I mean, you did great studies.
[02:41:16.426 --> 02:41:24.273]  And right shock, I want to bring in Bill Funk here, but how do people contact you to get you on their shows, or how do they find your material?
[02:41:25.414 --> 02:41:29.097]  They can come to me straight at thomashavilland at sbcglobal.net.
[02:41:30.271 --> 02:41:32.455]  I'm willing to talk to anybody, especially embalmers.
[02:41:32.515 --> 02:41:34.258]  I want to know what you're seeing in the embalming room.
[02:41:34.618 --> 02:41:37.123]  Whether you're seeing the clots or not, I want to know.
[02:41:38.348 --> 02:41:40.289]  You're another amazing, interesting American.
[02:41:40.329 --> 02:41:43.371]  I know you're just doing your duty and saw this and said, I want to see if it's true.
[02:41:43.492 --> 02:41:44.532]  You die suddenly.
[02:41:44.572 --> 02:41:45.373]  You've investigated.
[02:41:45.393 --> 02:41:49.936]  You say you're just doing your duty, but tell us a little bit before we go to this next guest about yourself.
[02:41:50.917 --> 02:41:52.878]  What brought you to this point?
[02:41:52.918 --> 02:41:54.519]  Because you're the exception.
[02:41:54.559 --> 02:41:59.062]  Most people just kind of ignore reality as if, well, I'm not supposed to interface with that.
[02:41:59.442 --> 02:42:00.603]  I just go with the flow.
[02:42:00.723 --> 02:42:03.345]  We're not just people in a river going one direction.
[02:42:03.385 --> 02:42:07.088]  We control our environment if we exercise our destiny, our purpose.
[02:42:07.928 --> 02:42:08.409]  Our power.
[02:42:09.850 --> 02:42:11.151]  Yeah, you have more power than you think.
[02:42:11.171 --> 02:42:12.311]  You're absolutely right, Alex.
[02:42:12.832 --> 02:42:15.394]  It all came to a head for me in October of 2021.
[02:42:15.494 --> 02:42:36.009]  I was a defense contractor working at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and Joe Biden came out with the mandates for the vaccine in September, and I got an email from a three-star Air Force general at the Air Force Base telling us, the military, the government civilians, and us defense contractors, of which I was one, what dates you had to get the shot by or else get kicked out.
[02:42:36.869 --> 02:42:38.290]  So I had done a lot of research.
[02:42:38.310 --> 02:42:40.611]  Our CDC was putting out lousy information.
[02:42:40.892 --> 02:42:48.116]  I was checking what the UK was doing, and they had a document called SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern, Technical Briefing No.
[02:42:48.136 --> 02:42:51.058]  23, dated 17 September of 2021.
[02:42:51.578 --> 02:42:56.161]  And in Table 5 of that document on pages 19 and 20, you can see... Hold on.
[02:42:56.181 --> 02:42:56.641]  Stay there.
[02:42:56.661 --> 02:42:57.002]  Stay there.
[02:42:57.022 --> 02:42:57.442]  We'll be right back.

[02:43:15.325 --> 02:43:16.005]  We're good to go.

[02:43:58.032 --> 02:44:01.755]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[02:44:02.075 --> 02:44:05.237]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[02:44:05.637 --> 02:44:10.121]  Because they can't get through this giant megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[02:44:10.741 --> 02:44:12.883]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[02:44:13.183 --> 02:44:21.168]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's You Will Eat the Bugs.
[02:44:21.789 --> 02:44:23.110]  This is The Great Awakening.
[02:44:23.630 --> 02:44:27.535]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[02:44:27.995 --> 02:44:31.519]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[02:44:31.799 --> 02:44:34.322]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.

[02:44:55.287 --> 02:44:56.949]  The Great Awakening at InfoWars Store.
[02:44:57.971 --> 02:44:59.272]  29 years on air.
[02:44:59.613 --> 02:45:02.595]  All I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalists.
[02:45:03.296 --> 02:45:08.641]  And I've done the best job I can to tell those words that have been accurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[02:45:09.021 --> 02:45:11.563]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves.
[02:45:11.984 --> 02:45:16.388]  Unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people, we don't do that.
[02:45:16.848 --> 02:45:18.750]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[02:45:19.110 --> 02:45:21.132]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product.
[02:45:21.172 --> 02:45:21.753]  It's so powerful.
[02:45:22.674 --> 02:45:32.727]  This is the breakdown product after your cells process it of folic acid, methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[02:45:33.187 --> 02:45:34.449]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[02:45:34.469 --> 02:45:35.310]  It's not a stimulant.
[02:45:35.570 --> 02:45:37.393]  It energizes your cells.
[02:45:37.953 --> 02:45:40.434]  And then everything else you take just supercharges it.
[02:45:40.494 --> 02:45:41.334]  It's so insane.
[02:45:41.674 --> 02:45:43.175]  It's foundational energy.
[02:45:43.635 --> 02:45:47.776]  The strongest formula out there at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:45:48.176 --> 02:45:51.037]  It doesn't just energize this operation against the tyrants.
[02:45:51.117 --> 02:45:52.217]  It energizes you.
[02:45:52.497 --> 02:45:53.898]  Get foundational energy now.
[02:45:57.881 --> 02:45:59.742]  But folks, we're standing up for our rights.
[02:45:59.762 --> 02:46:00.643]  We're standing up for your rights.
[02:46:00.683 --> 02:46:03.065]  We're standing up for all of our freedoms and our children.
[02:46:03.285 --> 02:46:10.930]  If you don't spread the word about the broadcast, if you don't share the links, if you don't buy products at InfoWarsStore.com, then I'm not griping at you.
[02:46:10.950 --> 02:46:12.051]  I'm just saying, what are you doing?
[02:46:13.131 --> 02:46:16.414]  Less than 1% of you ever buy a product at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:46:17.324 --> 02:46:24.310]  If just a half a percent more would go buy a book or a film or a t-shirt or get some of our great supplements and then reorder them because they really work.
[02:46:24.650 --> 02:46:25.231]  Just try it.
[02:46:25.851 --> 02:46:27.793]  We would be able to do so many things.
[02:46:28.153 --> 02:46:31.896]  I'm praying to God that he'll touch your heart to decide to support us.
[02:46:32.457 --> 02:46:34.198]  Infowarsstore.com
[02:46:36.357 --> 02:46:36.998]  It's been sold out.
[02:46:37.038 --> 02:46:37.818]  It's back in stock.
[02:46:37.878 --> 02:46:39.079]  Reformulated even stronger.
[02:46:39.880 --> 02:46:41.741]  Nitric boost to clean out your blood and your whole body.
[02:46:42.202 --> 02:46:43.283]  Vasodilation.
[02:46:43.303 --> 02:46:45.685]  It's got a lot of wonderful side effects.
[02:46:45.785 --> 02:46:46.285]  And I mean good ones.
[02:46:46.305 --> 02:46:47.566]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:46:48.167 --> 02:46:50.028]  It is powerful, so be careful with it.
[02:46:50.389 --> 02:46:51.550]  Next level foundational energy.
[02:46:51.650 --> 02:46:56.514]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:46:59.136 --> 02:47:03.219]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:47:03.740 --> 02:47:05.021]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:13.148 --> 02:47:13.349]  We're good.
[02:47:36.584 --> 02:47:39.225]  The globalist depopulationists miscalculated.
[02:47:39.245 --> 02:47:42.887]  It's one of them in their face, but they're getting ready for another attack.
[02:47:44.127 --> 02:47:46.128]  I wish this wasn't true, but it's the reality.
[02:47:47.129 --> 02:47:51.311]  All right, finishing up with Tom Haviland, a great data analyst.
[02:47:51.591 --> 02:47:54.052]  Tom, you were finishing a point about the British report you saw.
[02:47:54.072 --> 02:47:55.753]  Go ahead.
[02:47:57.211 --> 02:47:57.752]  I think.
[02:48:13.790 --> 02:48:19.875]  So, you know, the data was showing that you could catch COVID and transmit to others regardless of getting the shot or not.
[02:48:20.235 --> 02:48:27.221]  So it was unethical to put a mandate on people to take the shot when it didn't stop transmission of the virus.
[02:48:27.961 --> 02:48:29.823]  And also, it was just unethical, right?
[02:48:29.843 --> 02:48:31.924]  It violated all the tenets of the Nuremberg Code.
[02:48:32.284 --> 02:48:34.086]  So it was, I refuse to take the shot.
[02:48:34.466 --> 02:48:38.549]  In fact, I sent an email back to this Air Force three-star general saying, shame on you.
[02:48:39.030 --> 02:48:43.193]  Instead of standing up for our right to decide for ourselves whether or not to take an experimental drug
[02:48:43.843 --> 02:48:46.493]  You chose to spend your time trying to guilt us into taking the jab.
[02:48:46.935 --> 02:48:47.577]  Shame on you.
[02:48:48.300 --> 02:48:50.021]  And I didn't just send the email to him, Alex.
[02:48:50.421 --> 02:48:54.424]  I cc'd all 30,000 people that work at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.
[02:48:54.965 --> 02:48:55.985]  I knew what was going to happen.
[02:48:56.365 --> 02:49:09.254]  I got a call a half hour later from my boss of the defense contractor company I work for, and I was fired from my $165,000 a year job as an electrical engineer at the base for shaming the general in front of the entire base.
[02:49:09.834 --> 02:49:10.415]  But it was worth it.
[02:49:10.455 --> 02:49:14.257]  None of the colonels, none of the generals were pushing back on these unlawful mandates from Joe Biden.
[02:49:14.678 --> 02:49:17.680]  I consider these people to be either cowards or tyrants, Alex.
[02:49:18.340 --> 02:49:18.841]  Well, that's right.
[02:49:18.861 --> 02:49:21.803]  Because of people like you, we've now backed them off a certain degree.
[02:49:21.823 --> 02:49:23.504]  It's going to take more courage to survive this.
[02:49:23.965 --> 02:49:25.546]  Thank you so much, Tom Haviland.
[02:49:25.586 --> 02:49:26.027]  God bless you.
[02:49:26.047 --> 02:49:26.727]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:49:28.088 --> 02:49:28.849]  Thanks, Alex, for having me.
[02:49:29.750 --> 02:49:33.573]  Wow, there's so many great men and women like him out there that are now being activated by the tyranny.
[02:49:33.913 --> 02:49:35.555]  We're going to win this, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:49:36.015 --> 02:49:38.117]  We've got to have the communication systems to counter them.
[02:49:38.417 --> 02:49:41.760]  All right, our last guest today before Gerald Cilente takes over is Bill Funk.
[02:49:42.941 --> 02:49:45.523]  He's a licensed funeral director and bomber for 30 years.
[02:49:47.185 --> 02:49:47.966]  We're good to go.
[02:50:02.694 --> 02:50:04.176]  We're good to go.
[02:50:22.273 --> 02:50:31.298]  95% of bodies need more than two injections points to the clot blocking the arteries and veins, which were making embalming practices harder and more time-consuming.
[02:50:31.558 --> 02:50:36.061]  So for 30 years, he's embalming people, and boom, the shots start, and he can't even do that.
[02:50:36.081 --> 02:50:40.043]  I mean, this is just... Folks, they have already killed us, basically.
[02:50:40.953 --> 02:50:47.154]  He wants to state that all of his changes have been since the vaccines and not COVID.
[02:50:47.534 --> 02:50:49.235]  So, Bill Funk, you're on the phone.
[02:50:49.615 --> 02:50:49.875]  Thank you.
[02:50:49.895 --> 02:50:50.575]  You've got the floor.
[02:50:50.655 --> 02:50:51.495]  Tell us what you witnessed.
[02:50:52.995 --> 02:50:53.495]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:50:53.535 --> 02:50:54.095]  Appreciate it.
[02:50:55.476 --> 02:51:03.817]  Just since the vaccines came out, myself and other of my colleagues have noticed just a huge change in involving our practice anyway.
[02:51:04.897 --> 02:51:07.838]  We're seeing the microcloths or the coffee ground blood
[02:51:08.667 --> 02:51:11.468]  And we're also seeing the white fibrous spots.
[02:51:12.328 --> 02:51:25.451]  I was asked 10 days ago to be on a podcast for the first time, and like I told them, I can tell you 100% every single body that has had the vaccines compared to not.
[02:51:27.351 --> 02:51:28.252]  Tell us what you're seeing.
[02:51:30.112 --> 02:51:32.613]  We're just seeing the coffee ground blood.
[02:51:33.453 --> 02:51:36.794]  We're also seeing the white fibrous spots in the arteries and in the veins.
[02:51:38.954 --> 02:51:53.663]  Like you pointed out, my injections prior to 2022, 95% of the time we would do a one-point injection, which means some of us use the neck area, some use iliacs, some use femorals.
[02:51:55.464 --> 02:51:57.505]  And I was a crowded guy.
[02:51:57.565 --> 02:51:59.406]  I've always done that for 30 years.
[02:51:59.886 --> 02:52:07.991]  And all of a sudden now the fluids that we use for embalming aren't going into arms, hands, legs.
[02:52:09.083 --> 02:52:19.066]  So we're doing two, three, four, five-point injections just to get the fluid where we need it to go in order to preserve and to disinfect the body.
[02:52:19.106 --> 02:52:21.166]  So to be clear, you've been doing embalming.
[02:52:21.186 --> 02:52:22.126]  You can go in the neck.
[02:52:22.146 --> 02:52:23.107]  You can go in the leg.
[02:52:23.147 --> 02:52:27.848]  You can fill somebody up almost all the time in one spot, and now most of the time you can.
[02:52:28.388 --> 02:52:29.308]  Massive change.
[02:52:29.368 --> 02:52:30.048]  Just huge.
[02:52:30.068 --> 02:52:31.649]  100% of a turnaround, yes.
[02:52:31.749 --> 02:52:33.749]  It went from 95% one-point injections to...
[02:52:37.492 --> 02:52:42.673]  Prior to the vaccines to now, I'm 95% raising more than one vessel.
[02:52:43.273 --> 02:52:46.174]  What are the other people in the embalming business saying?
[02:52:48.994 --> 02:52:51.275]  All of the colleagues that I talk to are saying the same thing.
[02:52:53.815 --> 02:52:54.475]  God Almighty.
[02:52:55.376 --> 02:53:01.577]  Yeah, a lot of us are afraid to speak up just because losing our jobs or having...
[02:53:02.170 --> 02:53:05.192]  The government or whatever should look into our lives or whatever.
[02:53:05.232 --> 02:53:05.672]  No, I agree.
[02:53:05.712 --> 02:53:09.354]  But if a big percentage of us stand up, not even a majority, they can't get us all.
[02:53:10.354 --> 02:53:10.755]  Oh, right.
[02:53:10.835 --> 02:53:11.195]  For sure.
[02:53:11.395 --> 02:53:11.615]  Yep.
[02:53:11.715 --> 02:53:15.277]  And that's why I agreed, you know, 10 days ago to go.
[02:53:15.537 --> 02:53:17.738]  Richard asked me if I would go on a podcast with him.
[02:53:17.778 --> 02:53:18.479]  First time ever.
[02:53:19.259 --> 02:53:21.200]  I have never talked to Tom Havilland ever.
[02:53:21.640 --> 02:53:24.462]  Until last week, I said hello to him.
[02:53:24.722 --> 02:53:25.222]  That was it.
[02:53:25.382 --> 02:53:30.045]  And then, actually, I sent some pictures to Richard last night.
[02:53:30.926 --> 02:53:35.808]  And I said, look it, I just got back from vacation, first body I've done, and look at all this.
[02:53:36.408 --> 02:53:39.610]  And he says, how do you feel about Alex Jones tomorrow on the podcast?
[02:53:39.690 --> 02:53:41.150]  I said, fine, I have no problem with it.
[02:53:41.190 --> 02:53:42.351]  I did one, might as well do two.
[02:53:44.232 --> 02:53:49.594]  So it's just, it's absolutely crazy what we're seeing.
[02:53:50.434 --> 02:53:51.775]  Like I said, I've been doing it 30 years.
[02:53:53.095 --> 02:53:59.518]  And all of a sudden, a friend of mine, just to give you a little background, sent me the video of Died Suddenly.
[02:54:00.205 --> 02:54:07.388]  You know, a couple years ago when it first came out, and I refused to watch it because I had noticed a change in the embalming.
[02:54:07.809 --> 02:54:09.009]  I noticed the dirty blood.
[02:54:09.069 --> 02:54:11.871]  I noticed these bigger clots, these big jelly clots.
[02:54:12.551 --> 02:54:14.812]  And I was trying to figure out what the heck is going on.
[02:54:15.552 --> 02:54:21.555]  And so I refused to watch the video just because I didn't want it to, I guess, taint what I was seeing.
[02:54:22.195 --> 02:54:25.297]  Or, you know, I just didn't want it to affect what I was seeing.
[02:54:25.317 --> 02:54:26.618]  I wanted to figure it out for myself.
[02:54:27.518 --> 02:54:29.279]  And after a few months, I finally...
[02:54:30.563 --> 02:54:31.223]  Well, that's right.
[02:54:31.243 --> 02:54:36.445]  It's a giant crime going on with Bill Gates that says he wants to depopulate us, but now he's got a shot to protect us.
[02:54:36.465 --> 02:54:37.565]  And it's so obvious, and I get it's horrifying.
[02:54:38.006 --> 02:54:39.326]  Who wants to believe this?
[02:54:39.366 --> 02:54:39.866]  But it's real.
[02:54:39.906 --> 02:54:40.086]  Yeah.
[02:54:57.202 --> 02:54:58.463]  Yeah, oh, it's real.
[02:54:58.583 --> 02:55:06.349]  And, you know, prior... I owned my own funeral home for the past 20 years, and I just started doing trading, bombing, like, for churchmen.
[02:55:07.030 --> 02:55:16.457]  And just a few weeks ago, one of the owners that I embalmed for called me up, and he says, Hey, I got a question on the person you just embalmed.
[02:55:16.517 --> 02:55:17.558]  And I said, Let me guess.
[02:55:17.598 --> 02:55:19.439]  You're going to ask me if they were full of cloth.
[02:55:20.760 --> 02:55:22.802]  And he was, like, just silent on the phone.
[02:55:23.703 --> 02:55:24.163]  And he says...
[02:55:24.776 --> 02:55:25.377]  How did you know?
[02:55:25.457 --> 02:55:30.901]  And I said, well, that's the only reason anybody ever calls me anymore other than come do an embalming.
[02:55:31.321 --> 02:55:32.782]  I said, let me guess.
[02:55:32.822 --> 02:55:35.764]  The wife wants to know if the vaccine caused her husband's death.
[02:55:36.345 --> 02:55:37.586]  And he says, well, what do you think?
[02:55:37.646 --> 02:55:38.446]  I said, 100%.
[02:55:40.068 --> 02:55:38.446]  100%.
[02:55:41.068 --> 02:55:42.529]  I said he was just full.
[02:55:43.230 --> 02:55:43.930]  Completely full.
[02:55:44.771 --> 02:55:48.194]  And he's like, I can't even believe he knew what I was going to ask you.
[02:55:48.354 --> 02:55:50.615]  I said, what's happening?
[02:55:50.676 --> 02:55:52.437]  It's almost a daily basis I see this.
[02:55:53.669 --> 02:55:56.472]  They know it makes the body congeal protein and kills you.
[02:55:57.773 --> 02:55:59.895]  And who knows who it does it to or what.
[02:56:00.616 --> 02:56:02.398]  They knew exactly what they were doing.
[02:56:02.598 --> 02:56:13.188]  Pulling back from this, I've seen the insurance actuaries ever doubt, as the whistleblowers, all that, now it's in the news, that live expectancy is dropping dramatically the first time in modern history.
[02:56:14.410 --> 02:56:16.272]  But when I pull back and I look at that,
[02:56:17.389 --> 02:56:19.309]  Well, I do believe that there is a reason that
[02:56:46.894 --> 02:56:47.934]  People are dying, okay?
[02:56:47.954 --> 02:56:55.216]  Whether it's depopulation or whatever, the people that are involved are obviously trying to run everything.
[02:56:56.576 --> 02:57:05.759]  But like you, I go on vacation and people ask me what I do for a living and I tell them and immediately the first thing they want to know about is what do you think about the shots?
[02:57:05.839 --> 02:57:08.119]  What do you think about everything?
[02:57:08.139 --> 02:57:12.961]  And I just say, listen, I can tell you probably 99 to 100%
[02:57:15.137 --> 02:57:18.979]  Everybody I embalm that has had the vaccine compared to the ones that haven't.
[02:57:19.439 --> 02:57:25.361]  I said, I can guarantee you every single time I can tell you who's been vaccinated and who hasn't.
[02:57:26.962 --> 02:57:29.103]  All right, Bill Funk, a few more segments with you.
[02:57:29.123 --> 02:57:34.305]  I noticed that Tom Havilland's staying with us, so if he wants to pop in, he can welcome or he can listen.
[02:57:34.325 --> 02:57:38.186]  We love all you guys, and we love all the guests we've had on like Jamie today.
[02:57:38.907 --> 02:57:40.347]  Bill Funk is our guest.
[02:57:41.408 --> 02:57:42.548]  This isn't a game, folks.
[02:57:43.109 --> 02:57:43.949]  This is a real deal.
[02:57:47.208 --> 02:57:56.753]  Unless you've been living under a rock, you've heard how amazing turmeric is for inflammation for your joints, your bones, your blood, your organs, your mind, everything.
[02:57:57.213 --> 02:58:00.135]  Well, we have Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula with 95% Cuminoid Extract
[02:58:02.376 --> 02:58:04.857]  No one that we know of has it even above 85%.
[02:58:05.758 --> 02:58:13.521]  This is the strongest formula on the market, and it's way lower priced than some of the top brands out there that are 75%, 80% humanoid.
[02:58:14.002 --> 02:58:16.783]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is amazing.
[02:58:17.043 --> 02:58:18.304]  You're missing out if you don't try it.

[02:58:47.267 --> 02:58:49.808]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalists.
[02:58:50.189 --> 02:58:52.530]  And people can't identify who's a patron and who isn't.
[02:58:52.870 --> 02:58:56.012]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalists.
[02:58:56.072 --> 02:58:58.974]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.
[02:58:59.214 --> 02:59:09.800]  That's why I designed this amazing 1776 red, white, and blue Gadsden flag shirt so you can support the InfoWar and meet like-minded people everywhere when you wear it.

[02:59:50.659 --> 02:59:54.602]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:06.352 --> 03:00:14.254]  All right, Bill Funk is a licensed funeral director and bomber, approximately 30 years.
[03:00:14.274 --> 03:00:21.916]  He's talking about just clear light switch turns on, all these crazy tumors, all these crazy blood clots never before seen.
[03:00:22.576 --> 03:00:23.276]  Please continue.
[03:00:23.356 --> 03:00:25.697]  And we also have Tom Havilland riding shotgun with us.
[03:00:25.737 --> 03:00:28.698]  He's welcome to pop in with any observations, so take him live as well.
[03:00:28.738 --> 03:00:29.598]  But please continue, Bill.
[03:00:31.359 --> 03:00:33.099]  Yeah, I'm just...
[03:00:34.562 --> 03:00:40.725]  I guess at first I was shocked what I was seeing, and now it's unfortunately normal.
[03:00:42.685 --> 03:00:44.046]  I see it almost daily.
[03:00:45.627 --> 03:00:46.747]  That's another question I had.
[03:00:46.787 --> 03:00:50.589]  I know you're not a statistician, so you're dead reckoning, but that's the most accurate thing in the universe.
[03:00:51.533 --> 03:00:55.415]  We know it exploded in 2021, 2022, but now people aren't taking the shots as much.
[03:00:55.835 --> 03:01:04.200]  Are you still seeing as much of the blood clots and the bizarre structures as you saw before, or is it tapering off?
[03:01:04.260 --> 03:01:04.460]  Yeah.
[03:01:05.260 --> 03:01:07.061]  No, it's not tapering off for me anyway.
[03:01:07.501 --> 03:01:07.961]  Wow.
[03:01:08.802 --> 03:01:14.365]  It's still, I would say it's actually worse now than it has been.
[03:01:14.705 --> 03:01:17.186]  And that's what the morbidity numbers show.
[03:01:17.226 --> 03:01:17.927]  It's all-time high.
[03:01:17.987 --> 03:01:20.448]  So it shows this stuff's clearly continuing to grow.
[03:01:20.468 --> 03:01:20.548]  Yeah.
[03:01:21.658 --> 03:01:26.419]  Yeah, I took care of an 84-year-old man last night, and I'm absolutely full of him.
[03:01:30.040 --> 03:01:30.320]  Wow.
[03:01:30.741 --> 03:01:31.841]  Tom, you want to pop in here?
[03:01:33.681 --> 03:01:36.402]  Yeah, Alex, I had an experience, too.
[03:01:36.462 --> 03:01:47.225]  I went down and visited Mr. Richard Hirschman last August, and I was down there for an interview that we did actually with Cheryl Atkinson, the famous TV reporter that does that show.
[03:01:47.245 --> 03:01:49.586]  Yeah, former top CBS investigative journalist, yeah.
[03:01:50.168 --> 03:01:51.468]  Yeah.
[03:01:51.969 --> 03:01:54.009]  Unfortunately, our interviews have not aired yet.
[03:01:54.129 --> 03:02:02.992]  I think there might be some pressure from the channels that Cheryl's show is on are sponsored by Pfizer and Big Pharma, so they may not want Cheryl to run those episodes.
[03:02:03.332 --> 03:02:09.194]  But I was down there the day before, and Mr. Hirschman took me around to about three of the funeral homes that he embalms at.
[03:02:09.915 --> 03:02:10.175]  I think so.
[03:02:38.359 --> 03:02:38.959]  But it's happening.
[03:02:39.279 --> 03:02:39.659]  Wow.
[03:02:40.359 --> 03:02:45.320]  So how... It just makes my head spin.
[03:02:45.360 --> 03:02:48.581]  Bill, what else do you want to add?
[03:02:50.001 --> 03:02:50.561]  Nothing, really.
[03:02:50.641 --> 03:02:56.702]  It's just I want people to understand that if you've had the vaccinations, which I am vaccinated, okay?
[03:02:56.722 --> 03:03:01.123]  I took the first two and then saw what the heck was going on and said never again.
[03:03:01.623 --> 03:03:06.404]  But you can't, like me personally, I can't sit here and worry about
[03:03:06.952 --> 03:03:09.692]  What my blood looks like or what's in my blood because it's too late.
[03:03:10.253 --> 03:03:11.313]  I can't fix it, right?
[03:03:11.393 --> 03:03:16.254]  So if I drop over, I drop over, and it was on my own accord that I took the shot.
[03:03:16.434 --> 03:03:22.655]  So, you know, for people to worry about it is kind of mute.
[03:03:22.735 --> 03:03:25.475]  It doesn't do you any good to worry about it.
[03:03:25.655 --> 03:03:35.017]  I have one of my best friends, 62 years old, no preexisting conditions whatsoever, not a diabetic, not high blood pressure, pretty healthy man.
[03:03:36.997 --> 03:03:39.038]  February last year, I got a call from his wife.
[03:03:40.518 --> 03:03:42.439]  He just dropped over in the bathroom.
[03:03:42.819 --> 03:03:47.080]  He's totally left side paralysis, massive stroke, and they don't think he's going to live.
[03:03:47.100 --> 03:03:49.101]  Will you come back to take care of him?
[03:03:49.421 --> 03:03:50.522]  And I was in Florida at the time.
[03:03:50.562 --> 03:03:51.402]  I said, you bet I will.
[03:03:51.442 --> 03:03:52.442]  I'll be on a plane tomorrow.
[03:03:53.162 --> 03:03:55.663]  And she called me a little later and said they did surgery.
[03:03:55.723 --> 03:03:56.784]  They got some cloths out.
[03:03:56.904 --> 03:03:58.164]  Everything seems to be okay.
[03:03:59.084 --> 03:04:04.366]  And a week later, he was discharged, and all of his left side came back pretty much.
[03:04:04.426 --> 03:04:05.487]  He's probably about 95% right now.
[03:04:07.379 --> 03:04:15.186]  And he came over probably a month after he got out of the hospital, and he was helping me in my pole barn doing a motor on my boat.
[03:04:15.246 --> 03:04:17.628]  And I said, do you know what caused your stroke?
[03:04:17.728 --> 03:04:20.831]  And he looked at me like he was just looking at me weird.
[03:04:20.871 --> 03:04:23.874]  And I said, did they tell you what caused your stroke?
[03:04:23.934 --> 03:04:27.317]  And he's like, well, no, I don't have any pre-existing conditions.
[03:04:27.837 --> 03:04:28.618]  I don't have anything.
[03:04:28.658 --> 03:04:30.399]  I said, well, do you want me to tell you?
[03:04:30.499 --> 03:04:32.261]  And his wife was standing next to us, and I said...
[03:04:33.263 --> 03:04:34.464]  You got the boosters, didn't you?
[03:04:34.504 --> 03:04:35.604]  And he says, well, yeah.
[03:04:35.744 --> 03:04:37.365]  And I said, that's what caused your stroke.
[03:04:39.446 --> 03:04:39.886]  Stay there.
[03:04:39.906 --> 03:04:40.266]  Stay there.
[03:04:40.546 --> 03:04:42.887]  We've got to join some stations that join us.
[03:04:42.907 --> 03:04:44.148]  People say, we're on the Internet.
[03:04:44.188 --> 03:04:44.868]  Why are we having ads?
[03:04:44.908 --> 03:04:46.129]  We're on radio stations, folks.
[03:04:46.149 --> 03:04:46.549]  Remember that?
[03:04:46.969 --> 03:04:47.449]  Hundreds of them.
[03:04:47.469 --> 03:04:48.490]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds.
[03:04:58.789 --> 03:05:01.910]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:05:01.930 --> 03:05:03.471]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:05:04.231 --> 03:05:07.272]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:05:08.173 --> 03:05:16.256]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:05:17.096 --> 03:05:23.098]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[03:05:23.979 --> 03:05:24.879]  It's really just incredible.
[03:05:25.914 --> 03:05:28.776]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:05:28.796 --> 03:05:34.540]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:05:35.340 --> 03:05:36.261]  I know you spread the word.
[03:05:36.281 --> 03:05:37.782]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[03:05:37.802 --> 03:05:38.322]  Keep doing it.
[03:05:38.382 --> 03:05:44.987]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[03:05:45.427 --> 03:05:46.608]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[03:05:47.248 --> 03:05:50.970]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at M4Store.com.
[03:05:51.610 --> 03:05:56.232]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to M4Store.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:05:56.552 --> 03:05:57.393]  Please take action now.
[03:06:03.155 --> 03:06:04.416]  Crashing through the lies.
[03:06:05.477 --> 03:06:08.438]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[03:06:09.058 --> 03:06:10.659]  It's Alex Jones Show!
[03:06:18.789 --> 03:06:24.451]  When my dad was 14 years old, my grandmother put him in all these advanced studies.
[03:06:24.732 --> 03:06:26.412]  He was winning awards across the country.
[03:06:26.432 --> 03:06:30.674]  He was doing anti-communist broadcasts.
[03:06:30.714 --> 03:06:34.576]  He was 15 on top radio stations in Dallas.
[03:06:35.609 --> 03:06:36.610]  We're good to go.
[03:07:01.796 --> 03:07:05.637]  And he watches the two-and-a-half-hour film, and my mother goes, David, is this accurate?
[03:07:06.297 --> 03:07:07.038]  And he goes, yeah.
[03:07:07.198 --> 03:07:08.798]  And for the next 30 minutes said, yeah.
[03:07:09.138 --> 03:07:17.981]  They got me in this program, and then I was at UT, and after three years, they called me in and said, well, you and these other six people around the country are the top prospects.
[03:07:18.941 --> 03:07:20.162]  We want to carry out eugenics.
[03:07:20.182 --> 03:07:21.322]  We want to carry out a world government.
[03:07:21.522 --> 03:07:23.983]  And my dad said, no, thank you, and went and decided to be a doctor.
[03:07:24.997 --> 03:07:25.517]  We're good to go.
[03:07:54.754 --> 03:07:56.856]  Yeah, I was just finishing up my story with my buddy.
[03:07:57.536 --> 03:08:05.681]  He had a doctor's appointment a week later with a neurologist and the surgeon, and I said, well, you asked him what caused your stroke.
[03:08:05.782 --> 03:08:18.430]  So he did, and both of them said that there's no test that they can prove that the vaccine caused it, but their business has increased 30% since the vaccine, and yes, the vaccine caused your stroke.
[03:08:19.739 --> 03:08:22.700]  And so he called me on his way home and said, I'm only going to tell you this once.
[03:08:22.740 --> 03:08:23.281]  You were right.
[03:08:23.301 --> 03:08:24.841]  And I didn't even know what he was talking about.
[03:08:24.861 --> 03:08:26.442]  And I said, what do you mean I'm right?
[03:08:26.462 --> 03:08:29.303]  And he says, you're right about the vaccine causing my stroke.
[03:08:29.803 --> 03:08:31.324]  And I said, they actually admitted that?
[03:08:31.484 --> 03:08:34.145]  And he says, yep, to me and my wife's face.
[03:08:34.405 --> 03:08:36.866]  They admitted that the vaccine caused my stroke.
[03:08:37.927 --> 03:08:43.509]  So it's not only killing people, it's also having stroke effects on people that were perfectly healthy.
[03:08:45.373 --> 03:08:51.297]  Well, the main target's old people because they don't want to pay them Social Security, but this is a much larger plan to corrupt the medical system.
[03:08:51.797 --> 03:08:58.522]  From your just, as an American citizen, as a hard-working guy, what do you think's really going on here, Bill, and how do we counter this?
[03:09:00.603 --> 03:09:14.613]  It's definitely a population problem that they're trying to get rid of a bunch of people, and I don't have the slightest clue other than keep the information flowing about what's happening to try and change it.
[03:09:15.922 --> 03:09:22.324]  These people are thoroughly entrenched in every aspect of our lives, so I'm not sure how we can change it.
[03:09:22.504 --> 03:09:23.605]  We're going to have to dig them out.
[03:09:23.865 --> 03:09:35.809]  Anybody can type in migrants exempt from COVID shots, Reuters, AP, all of it, because, quote, the UN didn't want the liability of people they control taking the shots.
[03:09:36.009 --> 03:09:40.050]  How illustrative is that for you, Tom Haviland?
[03:09:41.866 --> 03:09:44.448]  Yeah, it's not a good situation, Alex.
[03:09:44.749 --> 03:09:48.832]  And you know, these white fibrous cloths, they're an equal opportunity killer.
[03:09:50.013 --> 03:09:53.236]  Richard Hirschman said a couple weeks ago he had to embalm a young girl.
[03:09:54.196 --> 03:10:00.159]  Out of respect for the family, I won't say her exact age, but she was a teenager, and Alex, she was riddled with the cloths.
[03:10:00.559 --> 03:10:03.020]  And then just a couple days later, he did a 31-year-old.
[03:10:03.561 --> 03:10:05.842]  So this is an equal opportunity killer.
[03:10:05.862 --> 03:10:08.343]  It's not just amongst the elderly.
[03:10:08.363 --> 03:10:10.224]  No, no, I totally agree.
[03:10:10.284 --> 03:10:11.685]  It just seems like that's who they targeted.
[03:10:11.705 --> 03:10:12.065]  You're right.
[03:10:12.125 --> 03:10:16.127]  It's just wiping out the young people, the heart attacks, the myocarditis.
[03:10:17.568 --> 03:10:28.243]  What was interesting in both the surveys I did, Alex, at the end of the survey, we had an optional comments box where we allowed the embalmers to expound upon what they were seeing in the embalming room if they wished to.
[03:10:28.263 --> 03:10:29.845]  It was not mandatory.
[03:10:29.865 --> 03:10:30.426]  It was optional.
[03:10:31.149 --> 03:10:38.536]  But as I said earlier, I never mentioned the words COVID or COVID vaccine anywhere in the survey instructions nor in the survey questions themselves.
[03:10:38.937 --> 03:10:47.966]  But despite that, many of the embalmers talked about the vaccines in their responses to the surveys, either implicating the...
[03:10:49.076 --> 03:10:49.516]  We're good to go.
[03:10:49.536 --> 03:10:50.377]  We're good to go.
[03:11:13.570 --> 03:11:18.211]  But surprisingly, if you go back and look in the medical literature, you can't find these clots.
[03:11:18.251 --> 03:11:19.711]  You can see grape jelly clots.
[03:11:20.091 --> 03:11:21.512]  You can find chicken fat clots.
[03:11:22.172 --> 03:11:25.493]  But you'll never see in the old medical books anything resembling these white fibers.
[03:11:25.613 --> 03:11:26.313]  Absolutely.
[03:11:26.333 --> 03:11:29.413]  And the good news is the globalists expected this to go smoother.
[03:11:29.973 --> 03:11:30.454]  It's not.
[03:11:30.574 --> 03:11:31.954]  They bit off more than they can chew.
[03:11:32.434 --> 03:11:33.634]  Tom Havilland, thank you so much.
[03:11:33.654 --> 03:11:34.474]  We'll talk to you soon.
[03:11:34.854 --> 03:11:36.315]  And Bill Funk, thank you so much.
[03:11:36.355 --> 03:11:37.415]  Anything else you'd like to add, Bill?
[03:11:38.535 --> 03:11:41.936]  No, I just appreciate you listening to what I had to say.
[03:11:43.066 --> 03:11:43.466]  Thank you.
[03:11:43.486 --> 03:11:44.027]  Well, thank you.
[03:11:44.047 --> 03:11:44.867]  All right, guys.
[03:11:45.027 --> 03:11:45.288]  Wow.
[03:11:45.388 --> 03:11:47.729]  Okay, the great Gerald Cilente is set to take over.
[03:11:47.749 --> 03:11:48.850]  We're going to break here in a moment.
[03:11:49.651 --> 03:11:51.012]  This is so real, people.
[03:11:51.072 --> 03:11:52.773]  We have the insurance actuaries.
[03:11:53.233 --> 03:11:58.016]  I have three stacks of medical reports and the FDA admitting it causes blood clots.
[03:11:58.077 --> 03:12:02.740]  This is irrefutable, but it is off the chart massive.
[03:12:04.574 --> 03:12:05.895]  So you all know about this.
[03:12:06.096 --> 03:12:06.816]  I know about this.
[03:12:06.877 --> 03:12:09.259]  Don't have that normalcy bias that we all know about this.
[03:12:09.299 --> 03:12:10.040]  We think everybody knows.
[03:12:10.100 --> 03:12:12.643]  The public is awake now to the truth.
[03:12:13.163 --> 03:12:16.347]  They're not awake to the full program, but they're awake to hear the truth.
[03:12:17.554 --> 03:12:21.915]  The climate is the best it's ever been to wake people up fully and stop this.
[03:12:21.935 --> 03:12:25.636]  So please, we're going to archive this interview at man.video.
[03:12:25.676 --> 03:12:27.597]  We'll post it to X. Thank God that's still there.
[03:12:27.617 --> 03:12:29.597]  I'm not looking a gift horse in the mouth.
[03:12:30.297 --> 03:12:35.659]  And share the living daylights out of it like your life depends on it because it does.
[03:12:35.839 --> 03:12:39.620]  I don't have headlines sensational enough to describe this last two hours.
[03:12:40.840 --> 03:12:42.381]  Reality is way stranger than fiction.
[03:12:42.421 --> 03:12:42.861]  This is...
[03:12:45.016 --> 03:12:52.942]  This is communism, Nazism, whatever you want to call it, hidden behind the medical system, hidden by the Black Rocks, hidden by the controllers that want to be able to get away with anything they want.
[03:12:53.402 --> 03:12:58.606]  And if they get the medical system to go along with this, they can get away with anything.
[03:12:58.647 --> 03:13:00.168]  So Gerald Cilente is set to take over.
[03:13:00.308 --> 03:13:05.612]  Please remember, I need you to make the decision to back us while we back you.
[03:13:05.632 --> 03:13:08.735]  I need you to make the decision to share the links in the articles.
[03:13:09.035 --> 03:13:09.735]  You're everything.
[03:13:09.755 --> 03:13:10.656]  You're not just part of it.
[03:13:11.417 --> 03:13:12.057]  I'm the tail.
[03:13:12.097 --> 03:13:12.658]  You're the dog.
[03:13:14.298 --> 03:13:23.061]  And I need you to go to Infowarsstore.com and get great t-shirts and great books and great films and great water filtration and other incredible products.

[03:14:15.839 --> 03:14:17.560]  My dad has a warehouse.
[03:14:18.550 --> 03:14:19.931]  He has his own crew.
[03:14:20.451 --> 03:14:21.272]  He has his own products.
[03:14:21.312 --> 03:14:22.812]  He thought I'd be shut down years ago.
[03:14:23.213 --> 03:14:29.336]  So without me even asking, he went and set up a warehouse, got crew, made his own products.
[03:14:29.356 --> 03:14:32.438]  A lot of the products he already had, but products that he was producing.
[03:14:33.239 --> 03:14:35.600]  DrJonesNaturals.com, he's a great sponsor now.

[03:15:11.340 --> 03:15:12.240]  My dad did a limited run.
[03:15:12.280 --> 03:15:13.061]  It's about to sell out.

[03:15:43.050 --> 03:15:53.271]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm handing the baton for the next 45 minutes to the amazing top trench forecaster, Gerald Cilente, and then the war machine, Owen Schroer, 3 p.m.
[03:15:53.291 --> 03:15:53.692]  Central.
[03:15:57.529 --> 03:15:58.030]  We're good to go.
[03:16:20.689 --> 03:16:21.530]  We're good to go.

[03:16:40.688 --> 03:16:41.149]  We're good to go.
[03:16:56.647 --> 03:16:59.209]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalist.
[03:16:59.590 --> 03:17:01.952]  And people can't identify who's a patriot and who isn't.
[03:17:02.252 --> 03:17:05.414]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalist.
[03:17:05.474 --> 03:17:08.377]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.
[03:17:08.617 --> 03:17:19.206]  That's why I designed this amazing 1776 red, white, and blue Gadsden flag shirt so you can support the Infowar and meet like-minded people everywhere when you wear it.

[03:17:58.174 --> 03:17:59.415]  Gunther in Tennessee.
[03:17:59.455 --> 03:18:00.496]  Thanks for calling, Gunther.
[03:18:00.656 --> 03:18:01.016]  Hey, Alex.
[03:18:01.196 --> 03:18:01.957]  First time caller.
[03:18:02.037 --> 03:18:03.878]  Real quick, wanted to float your foundational energy.
[03:18:04.419 --> 03:18:05.379]  Just started taking that.
[03:18:06.040 --> 03:18:10.363]  And, boy, three pills, the recommended dose, I was bouncing off the walls.
[03:18:10.483 --> 03:18:16.107]  But I tell you, foundational is the right name for that product because I'll cut down to one.
[03:18:17.228 --> 03:18:20.931]  It's like you have a baseline of energy that you were missing before that you got back.
[03:18:21.391 --> 03:18:29.632]  Well, I'm glad you mentioned that because it's methylfolate, the breakdown of folic acid, and a lot of people, particularly Europeans, don't absorb all of the folic acid.
[03:18:29.873 --> 03:18:30.973]  So it's not a stimulant.
[03:18:31.173 --> 03:18:34.593]  It's a totally natural thing that boosts energy that's foundational.
[03:18:34.893 --> 03:18:37.454]  And was I lying to you or did it not work?
[03:18:38.134 --> 03:18:39.334]  No, it was top-notch.
[03:18:39.374 --> 03:18:42.995]  And I was actually taking Red Pill Plus before, and that's got a little folic acid in it.
[03:18:43.055 --> 03:18:46.836]  I think there was a little buildup from this, but the energy from this was no jitters.
[03:18:47.016 --> 03:18:47.956]  I mean, it's top-notch.
[03:18:48.036 --> 03:18:48.756]  It's a great product.
[03:18:49.178 --> 03:18:50.139]  Well, thank you so much.
[03:18:50.179 --> 03:18:53.922]  Yeah, no, folic acid's great and it's in real red pill, but some can't break it down.
[03:18:53.982 --> 03:18:54.982]  This is the breakdown of it.
[03:18:55.042 --> 03:18:55.803]  That's exactly it.
[03:18:56.423 --> 03:18:58.705]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[03:18:58.865 --> 03:18:59.205]  Thank you.
[03:18:59.406 --> 03:19:01.947]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[03:19:02.027 --> 03:19:03.288]  I started taking that stuff.
[03:19:03.328 --> 03:19:06.531]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[03:19:06.631 --> 03:19:07.532]  When did you start taking it?
[03:19:07.812 --> 03:19:11.815]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[03:19:11.895 --> 03:19:12.155]  Mm-hmm.
[03:19:12.415 --> 03:19:15.136]  And I started eating a little better, but my blood pressure stayed high.
[03:19:15.156 --> 03:19:22.660]  And when I took the X2 iodine after about two or four weeks, I think my body detoxified of a bunch of metals and stuff that my body was storing.
[03:19:22.780 --> 03:19:24.981]  And my blood pressure came down to the perfect level.
[03:19:25.361 --> 03:19:28.303]  And I tell people the only thing I did was X2 iodine.
[03:19:28.763 --> 03:19:29.344]  I'm good to go.
[03:19:58.806 --> 03:19:59.787]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:19:59.807 --> 03:20:00.507]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:19.661 --> 03:20:21.282]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:20:21.602 --> 03:20:30.784]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Salente.
[03:20:31.704 --> 03:20:35.806]  Hey, great to be on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:35.826 --> 03:20:43.628]  You know, I've been listening to Alex and what he's been saying about the latest article that came out from Bloomberg.
[03:20:44.408 --> 03:20:48.449]  Largest COVID vaccine study yet finds links to health conditions.
[03:20:49.275 --> 03:20:56.938]  And then he goes on to also talk about Dr. Jones' naturals and the importance of getting them.
[03:20:58.339 --> 03:21:03.201]  This is the first book I worked on, Natural Healing, in 1988.
[03:21:03.781 --> 03:21:05.082]  Was it 36 years ago?
[03:21:06.182 --> 03:21:07.583]  When nobody was talking about this stuff.
[03:21:08.903 --> 03:21:13.245]  So going back to the COVID war, and that's what the politicians called it.
[03:21:14.107 --> 03:21:14.787]  We're good to go.
[03:21:44.229 --> 03:21:45.910]  When you go to war, they believe it.
[03:21:46.030 --> 03:21:47.411]  They called it a COVID war.
[03:21:49.592 --> 03:21:50.413]  We're going to war.
[03:21:50.453 --> 03:21:51.333]  We're going to war.
[03:21:51.413 --> 03:21:53.455]  So you go back to your trends journal.
[03:21:56.076 --> 03:22:05.082]  The COVID war broke out in China on Chinese Lunar New Year, January 2020, the year of the rat.
[03:22:05.502 --> 03:22:05.922]  That's right.
[03:22:08.303 --> 03:22:09.004]  And you remember those
[03:22:09.884 --> 03:22:12.686]  People walking down the street and all of a sudden, Oh, Lord, I'm dead.
[03:22:13.167 --> 03:22:13.827]  Yeah, remember that?
[03:22:13.847 --> 03:22:14.528]  Remember that crap?
[03:22:14.548 --> 03:22:18.951]  Remember they were building up all these health emergency places?
[03:22:19.051 --> 03:22:19.952]  Oh, you remember that stuff?
[03:22:20.792 --> 03:22:22.994]  No, you probably remember.
[03:22:23.234 --> 03:22:24.755]  How could you forget this?
[03:22:25.516 --> 03:22:31.561]  The arrogant little daddy's boy, the number two clown that closed down America.
[03:22:32.081 --> 03:22:34.823]  First, it was that little got-sown Gavin Newsom.
[03:22:35.323 --> 03:22:38.306]  Oh, my daddy worked for the Getty Gang!
[03:22:39.165 --> 03:22:40.286]  Oh, he's a lawyer!
[03:22:40.546 --> 03:22:42.328]  And I'm just a piece of scum!
[03:22:42.768 --> 03:22:48.613]  I'm locking down everybody while I party at the... What is that?
[03:22:48.653 --> 03:22:53.276]  That place where there's $400 a plate while he locks everybody down.
[03:22:54.197 --> 03:22:58.200]  You forgot the ships that they brought up in the Hudson River?
[03:22:58.721 --> 03:22:59.782]  The emergency ships?
[03:23:00.182 --> 03:23:02.584]  Oh, you forgot when they closed down Javits Center?
[03:23:03.765 --> 03:23:07.548]  To make room for all the people that were going to die of COVID?
[03:23:10.148 --> 03:23:12.570]  He had a laundry, something laundry it was called.
[03:23:12.930 --> 03:23:17.334]  French laundry or dirty laundry up in California where Gavin Newsom went.
[03:23:17.794 --> 03:23:21.457]  Yeah, so that little Andy Cuomo locked down everything.
[03:23:22.098 --> 03:23:23.099]  They locked down everything.
[03:23:25.561 --> 03:23:29.043]  We were the first magazine to say, this is BS.
[03:23:29.724 --> 03:23:36.690]  The headline, two weeks after the COVID wars launched in China, of your Trends Journal, coronavirus.
[03:23:38.357 --> 03:23:40.538]  106 dead in China.
[03:23:43.058 --> 03:23:46.399]  And the next line was 1.4 billion still alive.
[03:23:46.459 --> 03:23:47.460]  What are you telling me is crap?
[03:23:49.480 --> 03:23:56.942]  The reason China did that, again, I used to be on Hong Kong TV in 2019 when there were protests going on that you couldn't stop.
[03:23:58.423 --> 03:24:01.404]  I'm on these shows like 20 minutes, TV shows.
[03:24:04.404 --> 03:24:06.305]  And I say to the guy, look, Frank, what's going to happen?
[03:24:06.735 --> 03:24:08.076]  Mr. Salenti, we're not going to stop.
[03:24:08.096 --> 03:24:09.597]  We're not going to let the Chinese take over.
[03:24:09.617 --> 03:24:16.422]  Hong Kong, the city of 7.5 million people, over a million people were taken to the streets in protest.
[03:24:17.543 --> 03:24:18.383]  COVID war came.
[03:24:19.264 --> 03:24:20.325]  Get back in your house.
[03:24:20.425 --> 03:24:21.606]  State of emergency.
[03:24:21.926 --> 03:24:23.027]  Can't go out and protest.
[03:24:23.527 --> 03:24:24.308]  China took over.
[03:24:28.531 --> 03:24:29.852]  Let's go back to the Vax.
[03:24:31.973 --> 03:24:32.534]  It came out.
[03:24:32.554 --> 03:24:34.315]  96% efficacy rate.
[03:24:36.343 --> 03:24:36.743]  That's right.
[03:24:37.023 --> 03:24:38.083]  That's what they sold it as.
[03:24:38.664 --> 03:24:43.185]  We detail this in your trends journal like no other magazine in the world.
[03:24:43.765 --> 03:24:45.405]  Nothing comes close to it.
[03:24:46.626 --> 03:24:51.847]  And then you had those arrogant little boys.
[03:24:52.327 --> 03:24:53.888]  The Kimmel Clown.
[03:24:54.688 --> 03:24:55.208]  Yeah.
[03:24:57.269 --> 03:24:58.649]  One after another.
[03:25:01.070 --> 03:25:01.810]  Selling the Vax.
[03:25:06.397 --> 03:25:07.677]  The whole section.
[03:25:09.838 --> 03:25:13.559]  And this is an article, by the way, that came out on MACRA.
[03:25:13.879 --> 03:25:16.160]  M-A-R-C-A dot com.
[03:25:17.340 --> 03:25:20.381]  And this is December 30th of last year.
[03:25:20.661 --> 03:25:21.501]  So not too long ago.
[03:25:22.582 --> 03:25:28.263]  Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelsey is coming in for a world of hate.
[03:25:28.823 --> 03:25:31.644]  After it emerged, he may have been paid $20 million to endorse
[03:25:35.199 --> 03:25:38.701]  The controversial Pfizer vaccine against COVID-19.
[03:25:43.323 --> 03:25:54.008]  When you consider that he makes $14 million per season for his work in the NFL, to get $20 million for those commercials is quite a remarkable amount of money.
[03:25:56.489 --> 03:26:01.331]  And again, the article on InfoWars that they put out from Bloomberg says,
[03:26:01.849 --> 03:26:06.110]  Largest COVID vaccine study yet finds links to health conditions.
[03:26:06.651 --> 03:26:07.271]  No kidding.
[03:26:07.931 --> 03:26:09.732]  Oh, but wait a minute, Salenti!
[03:26:10.312 --> 03:26:14.473]  Bloomberg published it, so it has to be true.
[03:26:15.133 --> 03:26:28.258]  If you believed all those other facts from Dr. Joseph Mercola, who got banned from YouTube, and others that said, hey, these vaccines...
[03:26:29.468 --> 03:26:32.750]  They're dangerous and they're not doing what they said they were.
[03:26:33.550 --> 03:26:36.031]  Why you believe in misinformation?
[03:26:36.652 --> 03:26:37.152]  That's right.
[03:26:38.253 --> 03:26:40.214]  You're a conspiracy theorist.
[03:26:41.274 --> 03:26:46.817]  You're a conspiracy theorist if you don't swallow government crap.
[03:26:47.717 --> 03:26:48.698]  Don't grow up.
[03:26:49.398 --> 03:26:50.479]  Be a little clown.
[03:26:50.639 --> 03:26:52.500]  Oh, me, Gerald Salenti?
[03:26:54.661 --> 03:26:56.182]  I had a big rally here.
[03:26:57.214 --> 03:27:04.876]  July 4th, I believe it was the July 4th weekend, it was in 2020, when everything was locked down.
[03:27:05.377 --> 03:27:06.637]  Everything was locked down.
[03:27:09.058 --> 03:27:10.798]  I had a peace and freedom rally.
[03:27:11.599 --> 03:27:13.939]  We all died at the rally.
[03:27:14.639 --> 03:27:15.160]  That's right.
[03:27:16.280 --> 03:27:20.801]  The little clown newspaper up here, the Daily Freeman, Daily Piece of Crap.
[03:27:21.702 --> 03:27:23.262]  Oh, they really took after me.
[03:27:23.842 --> 03:27:24.302]  Oh, yeah.
[03:27:25.103 --> 03:27:26.103]  For having that rally.
[03:27:26.923 --> 03:27:38.348]  But when I have other peace rallies, Scott Ritter, Bill Giraldi, Judge Napolitano, not a peep, but I had a peace rally, don't force me to get the vax.
[03:27:38.368 --> 03:27:40.029]  You want to get the vax, get the vax.
[03:27:42.169 --> 03:27:48.192]  Why would I want to get the first gene therapy inoculation ever injected into the human body?
[03:27:49.653 --> 03:27:52.034]  Oh, the Operation Warp Speed.
[03:27:53.314 --> 03:27:55.375]  I figure you've got to be warped to get the warp speed.
[03:27:56.667 --> 03:27:58.629]  I'm not telling you what to do, but don't tell me what to do.
[03:28:00.551 --> 03:28:01.952]  And I've got to make this straight.
[03:28:03.213 --> 03:28:05.635]  I'm from a different place in a different time.
[03:28:07.577 --> 03:28:08.818]  Don't tell me what to do.
[03:28:09.138 --> 03:28:15.964]  I'm a Napolitano, born in the Bronx, 1946, at the height of America, right after World War II.
[03:28:16.285 --> 03:28:17.546]  The spirit is high.
[03:28:18.887 --> 03:28:20.148]  Don't tell me what to do.
[03:28:20.789 --> 03:28:21.930]  I won't tell you what to do.
[03:28:22.569 --> 03:28:23.149]  No more.
[03:28:23.610 --> 03:28:25.710]  You must do what we tell you to do.
[03:28:26.211 --> 03:28:28.392]  I'm a little piece of political crap.
[03:28:28.992 --> 03:28:31.413]  I'm a witness with me up in Michigan.
[03:28:32.473 --> 03:28:33.094]  Oh, no, no.
[03:28:33.194 --> 03:28:37.656]  I'm a little clown boy over there in Ohio.
[03:28:37.956 --> 03:28:38.996]  You do what I tell you.
[03:28:39.096 --> 03:28:43.158]  How about that little scumbag Murphy over there in Jersey?
[03:28:44.118 --> 03:28:45.559]  Oh, the Hogan clown.
[03:28:46.059 --> 03:28:47.200]  Oh, yeah, he was governor.
[03:28:47.220 --> 03:28:49.821]  Now he's running for senator of Maryland.
[03:28:50.501 --> 03:28:51.682]  One after another.
[03:28:53.271 --> 03:28:55.176]  And here's the big story.
[03:28:55.757 --> 03:28:56.399]  Here's the big...
[03:28:57.136 --> 03:28:57.756]  I'm not perfect.
[03:28:57.796 --> 03:28:58.576]  I'm under a lot of stress.
[03:28:58.616 --> 03:29:02.838]  But if I didn't have the supplements we have, we promote, I wouldn't be able to continue to be on air.
[03:29:03.418 --> 03:29:11.540]  And when you go to InfoWarsStore.com, you are funding the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists in an operation that the enemy admits has been the most effective at exposing them.
[03:29:11.740 --> 03:29:13.340]  Because we're fearless and we don't back down.
[03:29:13.701 --> 03:29:14.721]  We got God on our side.
[03:29:14.981 --> 03:29:16.501]  But God needs to work through you.
[03:29:16.821 --> 03:29:20.843]  You've got to make the decision to get great products you already need at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:29:20.883 --> 03:29:22.143]  And that is a 360 win.
[03:29:22.723 --> 03:29:25.704]  Nitric Boost, without me even knowing, became our number three bestseller.
[03:29:26.384 --> 03:29:27.065]  We're good to go.
[03:29:43.804 --> 03:29:46.207]  So I could never offer nitric boosters.
[03:29:46.227 --> 03:29:47.708]  It cost us so much to make.
[03:29:48.529 --> 03:29:50.751]  And now we can offer it for 40% off.
[03:29:51.292 --> 03:29:55.075]  Infowarsstore.com nitric boosts finally back in stock.
[03:29:55.095 --> 03:29:57.037]  40% off out of the gates.
[03:29:57.377 --> 03:29:58.338]  29 years on air.
[03:29:58.659 --> 03:30:01.621]  All I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalist.
[03:30:02.342 --> 03:30:07.666]  And I've done the best job I can to tell those words that have been accurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[03:30:08.066 --> 03:30:10.608]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves.
[03:30:11.028 --> 03:30:15.431]  Unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people, we don't do that.
[03:30:15.892 --> 03:30:17.793]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[03:30:18.153 --> 03:30:20.195]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product.
[03:30:20.215 --> 03:30:20.855]  It's so powerful.
[03:30:21.756 --> 03:30:26.719]  This is the breakdown product, after your cells process it, of folic acid.
[03:30:27.320 --> 03:30:30.202]  Methylfolate with high-quality organic...
[03:30:30.982 --> 03:30:31.763]  Be complex.
[03:30:32.243 --> 03:30:33.484]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[03:30:33.504 --> 03:30:34.705]  It's not a stimulant.
[03:30:34.825 --> 03:30:36.526]  It energizes your cells.
[03:30:37.007 --> 03:30:39.509]  And then everything else you take just supercharges it.
[03:30:39.549 --> 03:30:40.389]  It's so insane.
[03:30:40.730 --> 03:30:42.271]  It's foundational energy.
[03:30:42.711 --> 03:30:46.874]  The strongest formula out there at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:30:47.234 --> 03:30:50.077]  It doesn't just energize this operation against the tyrants.
[03:30:50.157 --> 03:30:51.297]  It energizes you.
[03:30:51.558 --> 03:30:52.979]  Get foundational energy now.
[03:30:58.683 --> 03:30:59.943]  Gunther in Tennessee.
[03:30:59.983 --> 03:31:01.024]  Thanks for calling, Gunther.
[03:31:01.264 --> 03:31:01.544]  Hey, Alex.
[03:31:01.704 --> 03:31:02.444]  First time caller.
[03:31:02.464 --> 03:31:04.404]  Real quick, wanted to plug your foundational energy.
[03:31:04.944 --> 03:31:05.905]  Just started taking that.
[03:31:06.565 --> 03:31:10.886]  And, boy, three pills, the recommended dose, I was bouncing off the walls.
[03:31:11.006 --> 03:31:16.607]  But I tell you, foundational is the right name for that product because I'll cut down to one.
[03:31:17.247 --> 03:31:21.488]  It's like you have a baseline of energy that you were missing before that you got back.
[03:31:21.628 --> 03:31:21.768]  Thanks.
[03:31:22.008 --> 03:31:30.152]  I'm glad you mentioned that because it's methylfolate, the breakdown of folic acid, and a lot of people, particularly Europeans, don't absorb all of the folic acid.
[03:31:30.392 --> 03:31:31.493]  So it's not a stimulant.
[03:31:31.713 --> 03:31:35.135]  It's a totally natural thing that boosts energy that's foundational.
[03:31:35.415 --> 03:31:37.976]  And was I lying to you or did it not work?
[03:31:38.656 --> 03:31:39.857]  No, it was top-notch.
[03:31:39.917 --> 03:31:43.539]  And I was actually taking Red Pill Plus before, and that's got a little folic acid in it.
[03:31:43.579 --> 03:31:47.381]  I think there was a little buildup from this, but the energy from this was no jitters.
[03:31:47.541 --> 03:31:48.481]  I mean, it's top-notch.
[03:31:48.501 --> 03:31:49.282]  It's a great product.
[03:31:49.707 --> 03:31:50.668]  Well, thank you so much.
[03:31:50.708 --> 03:31:54.470]  Yeah, no, folic acid's great and it's in real red pill, but some can't break it down.
[03:31:54.491 --> 03:31:55.491]  This is the breakdown of it.
[03:31:55.571 --> 03:31:56.352]  That's exactly it.
[03:31:56.892 --> 03:31:57.833]  Hello, Americans.
[03:31:58.613 --> 03:32:00.255]  I want to share with you a story.
[03:32:00.895 --> 03:32:07.140]  A story about inflammation, the silent menace that lurks within our bodies, affecting our health and well-being.
[03:32:08.220 --> 03:32:13.985]  Inflammation, the root cause of countless ailments, quietly wreaking havoc over time.
[03:32:15.046 --> 03:32:22.756]  Long-term exposure to inflammation has been linked to a myriad of health issues, from heart disease to arthritis, even cognitive decline.
[03:32:23.757 --> 03:32:31.327]  But fear not, for there's a beacon of hope found in the wisdom of nature, a remedy that has stood the test of time, turmeric.
[03:32:32.122 --> 03:32:45.428]  And now I present to you Baudis from Infowarsstore.com, a powerful blend crafted with precision, boasting 95% curcuminoids extracted from turmeric.
[03:32:45.588 --> 03:32:47.528]  It's good for your heart, your brain, everything.
[03:32:47.648 --> 03:32:54.791]  It is 40% off, back in stock, Baudis Ultimate Turmeric Formula, Infowarsstore.com.
[03:32:58.504 --> 03:33:04.427]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:18.574 --> 03:33:21.496]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:21.976 --> 03:33:25.738]  And now, your host, Gerald Salente.
[03:33:29.642 --> 03:33:33.844]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:33.884 --> 03:33:34.944]  Dr. Jones, natural.
[03:33:35.004 --> 03:33:35.724]  Do what you can.
[03:33:35.744 --> 03:33:38.345]  Get the products to support InfoWars.
[03:33:38.825 --> 03:33:40.546]  Because InfoWars has supported you.
[03:33:40.566 --> 03:33:43.347]  Again, what they're talking about now, this is blacklisted.
[03:33:43.367 --> 03:33:48.729]  This is how you get thrown off Google and YouTube.
[03:33:49.750 --> 03:33:52.811]  And how you've been blacklisted for saying what they're now saying.
[03:33:53.091 --> 03:33:55.892]  And this is only the beginning of it with this COVID war crap.
[03:33:56.667 --> 03:34:08.153]  So do what you can to support InfoWars, and they've got these great sales that you can take advantage of, and that bodies is one of them, because you've got to get that body and bodies now with all that's going on.
[03:34:08.193 --> 03:34:10.935]  You want to get these products to really help you.
[03:34:11.335 --> 03:34:16.758]  And it's now back in stock, by the way, and you're getting 40% off.
[03:34:18.379 --> 03:34:23.742]  And it's used as a medical herb, and it's been done for like thousands of years, this turmeric.
[03:34:24.215 --> 03:34:24.615]  We're good to go.
[03:34:54.790 --> 03:34:56.151]  Boy, I shouldn't say boy.
[03:34:56.171 --> 03:34:58.172]  If I say, oh boy, I gotta say girl too.
[03:34:58.612 --> 03:34:59.733]  Or transgender.
[03:35:00.053 --> 03:35:05.236]  And boy, you know, you really need this stuff now because, I mean, they're killing us in a million ways.
[03:35:05.256 --> 03:35:06.917]  You like all those microplastics?
[03:35:07.418 --> 03:35:08.658]  I like the GMOs.
[03:35:08.738 --> 03:35:11.180]  No, more pesticides on what they're feeding us.
[03:35:11.760 --> 03:35:14.822]  You know, ultra-processed is really great stuff.
[03:35:15.302 --> 03:35:21.366]  See, you really need these bodies to boost you because they're getting us in so many different ways.
[03:35:22.247 --> 03:35:22.787]  And, um,
[03:35:23.843 --> 03:35:26.084]  So don't wait until it gets out of stock.
[03:35:26.824 --> 03:35:30.045]  Help support your immune system and also supporting InfoWars.
[03:35:31.066 --> 03:35:42.610]  You go to InfoWarsStore.com InfoWarsStore.com Get your bodies and ease it up because you really, really need it now.
[03:35:44.611 --> 03:35:46.271]  You know, I want to go on with this.
[03:35:46.511 --> 03:35:49.092]  I wasn't going to talk about this today.
[03:35:49.913 --> 03:35:53.174]  I had a lot of other things to talk about, like the ship that just got
[03:35:54.215 --> 03:36:00.759]  Attacked by the Houthis and Israel saying that there's no two-state solution.
[03:36:01.220 --> 03:36:09.405]  Oh no, the Palestinians will keep stealing their land in the name of settlements in violation of the Geneva Convention and Article 242 of the United Nations.
[03:36:10.426 --> 03:36:18.151]  So we're going to talk a lot about that, what's going on in the economy and what to watch for because we're really in very, very serious times.
[03:36:18.231 --> 03:36:19.752]  But I wanted to talk about this because
[03:36:20.267 --> 03:36:24.229]  This COVID war changed the country and changed the world.
[03:36:24.669 --> 03:36:26.750]  The damage it's done is incalculable.
[03:36:27.711 --> 03:36:31.413]  And again, one of our top trends is banks go bust.
[03:36:32.193 --> 03:36:37.476]  And it's because of the COVID war that they call the pandemic now.
[03:36:37.756 --> 03:36:41.218]  It was not a pandemic where you had the Black Plague.
[03:36:44.140 --> 03:36:46.561]  What, about 60% of Europe was wiped out?
[03:36:48.115 --> 03:37:01.880]  Only 99.93% of the people on the planet, from when the COVID war began to when it ended, died of the virus, the coronavirus.
[03:37:03.080 --> 03:37:12.684]  Out of those, the vast majority, as the data showed, had pre-existing comorbidities, like 2.3% of pre-existing comorbidities or higher.
[03:37:14.031 --> 03:37:18.393]  And then in the United States where they force kids, don't go to school, go home.
[03:37:18.813 --> 03:37:20.273]  Now they're all messed up mentally.
[03:37:20.594 --> 03:37:22.194]  Again, the damage of the COVID war.
[03:37:24.515 --> 03:37:27.836]  The data, they stopped it last June, June 2023.
[03:37:27.876 --> 03:37:30.657]  Out of 73 million 1 to 17-year-olds, under 2,000 died of the COVID.
[03:37:30.717 --> 03:37:32.598]  Yet they forced them to get to jabs.
[03:37:41.801 --> 03:37:50.107]  And according to the CDC, 61% of the 1 to 17-year-olds that were hospitalized were obese.
[03:37:50.708 --> 03:37:51.408]  You're no kidding.
[03:37:52.349 --> 03:37:56.372]  Again, if I was elected president, I'd have a fat tax.
[03:37:56.392 --> 03:37:59.114]  The more you weigh, the more you pay.
[03:37:59.594 --> 03:38:02.516]  Eating all this crap and you're driving up the cost of everything.
[03:38:02.836 --> 03:38:04.017]  How about getting in good health?
[03:38:04.037 --> 03:38:05.238]  How about natural healing?
[03:38:06.139 --> 03:38:07.760]  Again, the Dr. Jones naturals.
[03:38:08.280 --> 03:38:09.101]  Natural healing.
[03:38:09.482 --> 03:38:12.063]  They never talked about that during the COVID war.
[03:38:13.184 --> 03:38:17.826]  Don't build up your vitamin D. I take 20 supplements and vitamins a day.
[03:38:17.846 --> 03:38:20.147]  I haven't been sick in five years.
[03:38:20.727 --> 03:38:21.427]  Knock on wood.
[03:38:23.668 --> 03:38:27.350]  They don't talk about that because this is who runs the country.
[03:38:28.150 --> 03:38:35.133]  The military industrial complex, the drug dealers that they call big pharma,
[03:38:38.459 --> 03:38:41.580]  The Bankster Bandits and Big Tech.
[03:38:42.660 --> 03:38:43.320]  They're in control.
[03:38:44.220 --> 03:38:44.980]  They run the show.
[03:38:45.460 --> 03:38:46.500]  Oh, the Bankster Bandits?
[03:38:46.900 --> 03:38:53.061]  Miss Faccia Brutto, Janet Yellen, the former Fed head, now our Treasury Secretary.
[03:38:53.081 --> 03:38:53.602]  You got it?
[03:38:53.622 --> 03:38:58.502]  Oh, the Big Tech will tell you what to say.
[03:38:58.602 --> 03:39:06.424]  If you don't believe what we say, what the government tells us to say and do, then you believe in misinformation.
[03:39:06.944 --> 03:39:08.304]  And you're a conspiracy theorist.
[03:39:10.026 --> 03:39:10.987]  So I'm going to go back to this.
[03:39:11.027 --> 03:39:14.269]  By the way, that clown Cuomo, this is from March 2020.
[03:39:15.369 --> 03:39:16.290]  March 20th, 2020.
[03:39:18.091 --> 03:39:19.852]  From the CNN.
[03:39:20.472 --> 03:39:23.994]  Cuomo orders all non-essential New York workers to stay home.
[03:39:27.757 --> 03:39:27.937]  Yep.
[03:39:29.938 --> 03:39:32.600]  Cuomo acknowledged that these actions will cause disruption.
[03:39:33.100 --> 03:39:34.681]  It will cause businesses to close.
[03:39:37.182 --> 03:39:39.624]  And he said, I accept full responsibility.
[03:39:40.208 --> 03:39:45.271]  If someone is unhappy, if someone wants to blame someone or complain about someone, blame me.
[03:39:45.951 --> 03:39:48.892]  There is no one else responsible for this decision.
[03:39:49.693 --> 03:39:51.213]  In other words, I'm in charge.
[03:39:51.293 --> 03:39:52.194]  Follow my orders.
[03:39:53.154 --> 03:39:59.778]  If he came to me and told me what to do, man to man, I'd say, F you!
[03:40:00.418 --> 03:40:02.899]  Who the hell are you to tell me what to do?
[03:40:03.359 --> 03:40:05.140]  Oh, by the way, don't believe that?
[03:40:06.401 --> 03:40:08.722]  You can get this at trendsjournal.com.
[03:40:10.100 --> 03:40:15.124]  Hey, politicians, who the F for you to tell me what to do?
[03:40:16.765 --> 03:40:18.867]  Hey, politicians, got it?
[03:40:20.048 --> 03:40:22.249]  A finger speaks a thousand words.
[03:40:27.373 --> 03:40:36.260]  Civil fines and mandatory closures to businesses that don't comply with the new mandate will be enforced beginning on February.
[03:40:37.761 --> 03:40:38.602]  This is just some of it.
[03:40:39.062 --> 03:40:39.863]  This is some of the stuff.
[03:40:41.708 --> 03:40:46.972]  This is an arrogant, arrogant, arrogant, arrogant little boy.
[03:40:46.992 --> 03:40:48.773]  Hey, I'm the judge.
[03:40:49.194 --> 03:40:50.635]  Here comes the judge.
[03:40:54.097 --> 03:40:55.999]  Toilet paper record, New York Times.
[03:40:58.961 --> 03:41:00.302]  August 24th, 2021.
[03:41:01.423 --> 03:41:08.108]  Two judges tell defendants to be vaccinated.
[03:41:11.035 --> 03:41:13.936]  The defendant was charged with a number of minor crimes.
[03:41:14.137 --> 03:41:15.237]  All minor crimes, right?
[03:41:16.498 --> 03:41:17.738]  Including drug possession.
[03:41:18.339 --> 03:41:24.782]  Oh, you mean when he had the stuff from one of the big drug companies?
[03:41:24.862 --> 03:41:25.883]  Oh, no, no, no.
[03:41:27.143 --> 03:41:27.904]  That's legal.
[03:41:28.284 --> 03:41:29.925]  You know, anyway.
[03:41:32.506 --> 03:41:33.607]  And shoplifting.
[03:41:34.487 --> 03:41:37.889]  He was prepared to plead guilty and the prosecutor agreed.
[03:41:38.789 --> 03:41:40.050]  But a Bronx judge
[03:41:41.753 --> 03:41:45.254]  Approving the deal, added his own condition.
[03:41:46.294 --> 03:41:51.236]  The defendant had to get the COVID-19 vaccination.
[03:41:52.896 --> 03:42:00.299]  A week later, a Manhattan judge made the same order this time of a woman seeking bail before the trial.
[03:42:03.240 --> 03:42:10.682]  Judge Rakoff, I think it's jerk-off, I think they spelt it wrong, agreed
[03:42:11.496 --> 03:42:12.796]  That it fell to him.
[03:42:14.137 --> 03:42:15.197]  It fell to him.
[03:42:15.217 --> 03:42:16.278]  Hey!
[03:42:16.698 --> 03:42:17.978]  Don't you know who I am?
[03:42:18.518 --> 03:42:21.239]  I'm a political clown that became a judge!
[03:42:21.799 --> 03:42:22.980]  I'm Rakoff!
[03:42:23.740 --> 03:42:25.421]  You do what I tell you!
[03:42:27.141 --> 03:42:28.762]  You're in America!
[03:42:31.282 --> 03:42:38.625]  Judge Rakoff argued that it fell to him to determine whether a person seeking release
[03:42:40.149 --> 03:42:43.110]  Represented a danger to the community.
[03:42:43.130 --> 03:42:46.972]  You ready?
[03:42:47.972 --> 03:43:05.839]  Quote, the unvaccinated, he wrote, did pose a danger given their quote, enhanced risk of infecting others, innocent people, and even potentially causing their deaths.
[03:43:07.580 --> 03:43:08.420]  Can you imagine this?
[03:43:08.841 --> 03:43:09.641]  Can you imagine this?
[03:43:10.168 --> 03:43:10.348]  Yeah.
[03:43:10.368 --> 03:43:11.789]  This is just a little bit
[03:43:38.931 --> 03:43:45.012]  A little tiny bit in your Trends Journal and how we were covering it, just some of the headlines.
[03:43:46.252 --> 03:43:50.293]  COVID vaccines essentially worthless within nine months.
[03:43:50.893 --> 03:44:01.455]  The COVID-19 vaccines that were sold during the COVID war as a panacea for the outbreak with a 94% to 96% efficacy rate, blah, blah, blah, blah, false.
[03:44:01.935 --> 03:44:02.175]  All right?
[03:44:02.575 --> 03:44:03.456]  That's how they sold it.
[03:44:03.736 --> 03:44:05.236]  Again, we only put the data in there.
[03:44:05.771 --> 03:44:08.972]  The data that's reported by the mainstream, by the way.
[03:44:11.072 --> 03:44:11.853]  Another article.
[03:44:12.733 --> 03:44:21.395]  Arrogant COVID war champ, Stephen Van Zandt, who got the shot and got COVID, now selling Ukraine war.
[03:44:21.735 --> 03:44:25.116]  Remember all these little celebrities selling the crap?
[03:44:27.657 --> 03:44:30.377]  Get the vax, die from COVID, read the story.
[03:44:30.397 --> 03:44:31.958]  A new study found that 58% of...
[03:44:33.393 --> 03:44:34.174]  Those in the U.S.
[03:44:34.194 --> 03:44:50.264]  who died from COVID-19 in August, and this is from November 29th, that's my birthday date, 2022, who died from COVID-19 in August had followed the government orders and received their vaccination for a booster jab.
[03:44:51.965 --> 03:44:57.489]  COVID clown show, John Kerry becomes latest fully vaxxed drug pusher to come down with virus.
[03:44:58.490 --> 03:45:01.732]  Pfizer CEO brags he's happy he got jabbed and got COVID.
[03:45:03.073 --> 03:45:03.233]  Again,
[03:45:03.914 --> 03:45:05.495]  One article after another.
[03:45:05.815 --> 03:45:08.216]  So what's coming out now is very old news.
[03:45:08.336 --> 03:45:08.616]  U.S.
[03:45:08.636 --> 03:45:11.597]  top health head becomes COVID home run king.
[03:45:11.957 --> 03:45:13.237]  Gets COVID second time.
[03:45:13.737 --> 03:45:14.778]  Xavier Becerra.
[03:45:17.319 --> 03:45:18.039]  What else you got here?
[03:45:18.059 --> 03:45:20.380]  There's a whole load of them.
[03:45:23.001 --> 03:45:23.501]  Ready for this?
[03:45:23.521 --> 03:45:26.282]  This is the headlines from your church journal.
[03:45:26.762 --> 03:45:32.124]  Pfizer drug lord pushing yearly COVID jab calls those who won't swallow BS criminals.
[03:45:32.744 --> 03:45:32.864]  Yep.
[03:45:37.978 --> 03:45:41.280]  America, clown show number two, how low can you go?
[03:45:41.861 --> 03:45:48.505]  Pinhead Penn, that guy Penn, declares vaccines should be mandatory.
[03:45:49.225 --> 03:45:50.326]  That little boy of nothing.
[03:45:51.707 --> 03:45:52.868]  Pen, pencil head.
[03:45:55.049 --> 03:45:58.792]  Celebrities, that's smart, you're stupid.
[03:45:59.632 --> 03:46:04.916]  As we have been reporting, so-called actors, people who can memorize scripts and play someone who they are not,
[03:46:05.979 --> 03:46:06.919]  And this is an example.
[03:46:06.979 --> 03:46:09.400]  We noted how Piers Morgan had gone a little clown boy.
[03:46:09.420 --> 03:46:10.380]  Again, I'm going through.
[03:46:11.040 --> 03:46:12.901]  There are tons of them here.
[03:46:12.921 --> 03:46:16.642]  I want to give you the highlights of how bad this is, how terrible it's been.
[03:46:17.922 --> 03:46:18.762]  And Kid Rock, yeah, yeah.
[03:46:39.873 --> 03:46:42.995]  UCLA doctor, no jab, no job, call the police.
[03:46:43.055 --> 03:46:56.384]  Dr. Christopher B. Rake, an anesthesiologist at UCLA, was escorted out of his workplace on Monday for trying to enter the building without being vaccinated for COVID-19, according to the report.
[03:46:56.404 --> 03:46:58.926]  Imagine this, a doctor.
[03:47:01.648 --> 03:47:05.630]  The school said in a statement that all in-person employees must be vaccinated.
[03:47:07.452 --> 03:47:09.473]  America's clown show, how low can you go?
[03:47:10.083 --> 03:47:13.084]  Kimmel and Stern call for death of the unvaxxed.
[03:47:13.764 --> 03:47:34.868]  Howard Stern, the arrogant shock jock, has joined a country of comedy elites publicly equating the COVID-19 vaccine with freedom and or ridiculing and expressing their contempt for those who see vaccine mandates, mask mandates, and other restrictions as abridgments of freedom.
[03:47:36.048 --> 03:47:39.049]  Trans Journal have reported many of these similar remarks.
[03:47:39.249 --> 03:47:39.929]  Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[03:47:41.107 --> 03:47:43.508]  Mick Jagger and Bill Gates, Blood Brothers.
[03:47:44.028 --> 03:47:47.730]  Mick Jagger became a world-renowned rock star with the Rolling Stones.
[03:47:48.210 --> 03:47:53.693]  Now he's one of the lead rockers, mocking those who don't want to line up and get vaccinated.
[03:47:54.273 --> 03:48:05.879]  Jagger teamed up with another rock celebrity, David Grohl of Nirvana, and the Foo Fighters to write and perform a song that aims to get people vaccinated.
[03:48:06.379 --> 03:48:09.741]  Again, on and on and on and on and on and on.
[03:48:11.667 --> 03:48:12.747]  Totally disgusting.
[03:48:15.788 --> 03:48:20.249]  And again, this is April 14th, 2020, Trends Journal.
[03:48:23.010 --> 03:48:33.493]  In Italy, where it is now known that 99% of the people who died from COVID-19, and that was the first country to lock down after China, had significant health issues before contracting it.
[03:48:34.013 --> 03:48:36.394]  And the average age of those who died was 79.5 years of age.
[03:48:39.281 --> 03:48:47.707]  Last Friday, Premier Minister Giuseppe Conte, you can take that O out and put a U in there somewhere, extended one of the most severe lockdowns in the world.
[03:48:49.068 --> 03:48:49.268]  Yep.
[03:48:50.829 --> 03:48:51.270]  On and on.
[03:48:52.270 --> 03:48:52.791]  On and on.
[03:48:54.112 --> 03:48:54.592]  On and on.
[03:48:54.652 --> 03:49:03.638]  In Colombia, a citizen can leave his or her house the same number of days as the number on the person's national identity card.
[03:49:04.079 --> 03:49:06.761]  In Serbia, the government has banned dog walking after 5 p.m.,
[03:49:08.792 --> 03:49:19.698]  In New Zealand, Prime Minister Arden has told citizens to behave as if they have coronavirus, eliminating all physical contact with anyone outside the house or living space.
[03:49:21.599 --> 03:49:22.459]  Then we have the numbers.
[03:49:23.140 --> 03:49:27.942]  As of last Saturday, four people have died from the virus in a country of 4,800,000.
[03:49:28.102 --> 03:49:29.883]  On and on.
[03:49:32.605 --> 03:49:36.507]  So the damage that this COVID war has done is incalculable.
[03:49:37.426 --> 03:49:43.487]  Physically, mentally, spiritually, and financially.
[03:49:46.368 --> 03:49:52.389]  We're going to have the biggest banking crisis the likes of which we've never seen in modern history.
[03:49:52.769 --> 03:49:54.169]  They're barely talking about it.
[03:49:55.489 --> 03:49:58.290]  Because of the COVID war, people started working at home.
[03:49:58.910 --> 03:50:05.071]  And as they're working at home day after day, week after week, year after year, they're saying, I'm commuting an hour and a half each way to work.
[03:50:05.111 --> 03:50:05.611]  I'm not doing that.
[03:50:06.465 --> 03:50:10.648]  Getting up at 5 in the morning, wasting my life driving the city, costing me all this money.
[03:50:10.668 --> 03:50:11.349]  I'm not doing anything.
[03:50:13.731 --> 03:50:15.312]  And again, I say this over and over again.
[03:50:15.672 --> 03:50:20.797]  If you're the employer, you don't see 300 people in little cubicles and you're paying for all this space.
[03:50:20.817 --> 03:50:21.397]  Yes, stay home.
[03:50:21.437 --> 03:50:22.538]  Come in a couple of days a week.
[03:50:22.558 --> 03:50:24.900]  I don't want to pay all this rent.
[03:50:29.189 --> 03:50:30.590]  There's going to be an office building bust.
[03:50:30.610 --> 03:50:32.111]  They're going to be defaulting on the loans.
[03:50:32.531 --> 03:50:34.012]  All your data's in the Trends Journal.
[03:50:34.092 --> 03:50:37.274]  Trillions of dollars of commercial real estate loans are coming up.
[03:50:39.275 --> 03:50:39.655]  Trillions.
[03:50:43.217 --> 03:50:44.038]  French Laundry.
[03:50:44.078 --> 03:50:50.942]  That was the place where the clown Gavin Newsom, like it's a $400 plate, having parties while everybody's locked down.
[03:50:52.342 --> 03:50:56.845]  Going back to the office building bust is going to cause the banking bust.
[03:50:57.465 --> 03:50:58.646]  It's also going to hurt
[03:50:59.093 --> 03:51:04.495]  The tax revenue is coming in from cities because that's where they get a lot of your money from.
[03:51:04.575 --> 03:51:10.718]  And many of the businesses that depended on commuters have gone out of business or are going out of business.
[03:51:12.879 --> 03:51:13.679]  This is serious.
[03:51:14.419 --> 03:51:15.260]  And it's global.
[03:51:17.561 --> 03:51:20.002]  Germany is in a recession.
[03:51:21.242 --> 03:51:23.623]  Japan is in a recession.
[03:51:27.392 --> 03:51:34.136]  China's economy, oh, they're bragging now, you know, they just had another Lunar New Year, the Year of the Dragon.
[03:51:34.596 --> 03:51:40.980]  Oh, yeah, spending went up over pre-COVID 2019 levels.
[03:51:42.201 --> 03:51:43.242]  Yeah, gone up.
[03:51:43.422 --> 03:51:44.622]  It's a temporary boost.
[03:51:45.423 --> 03:51:49.625]  You got a real estate bust there that's going to bring down the country in a big way.
[03:51:50.306 --> 03:51:53.068]  Their debt-to-GDP ratio is like, oh, about 300%.
[03:51:53.108 --> 03:51:53.528]  300 debt-to-GDP ratio.
[03:51:59.867 --> 03:52:04.651]  It was overbuilt to begin with when they had the boom, when they brought into the World Trade Organization.
[03:52:05.051 --> 03:52:14.599]  And then after locking down for three years, zero COVID policy, they destroyed the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people.
[03:52:16.241 --> 03:52:18.363]  And again, you got to keep making the connections.
[03:52:18.523 --> 03:52:19.624]  All things are connected.
[03:52:21.966 --> 03:52:25.669]  Tracking trends is an understanding of where we are, how we got here and where we're going.
[03:52:26.830 --> 03:52:28.131]  So as I mentioned earlier,
[03:52:28.527 --> 03:52:35.931]  Oh, they just bombed the Houthis, just knocked out a British ship, and the guys had to leave the ship in the Red Sea.
[03:52:36.812 --> 03:52:37.572]  And they're doing this.
[03:52:37.592 --> 03:52:48.738]  They're making it very clear that they're doing this and won't stop doing it until Israel stops slaughtering the people in Gaza, which is now over 30,000.
[03:52:48.778 --> 03:52:48.738]  30,000.
[03:52:48.878 --> 03:52:51.980]  You go over the news during the weekend.
[03:52:56.786 --> 03:53:00.367]  You look at the front pages of the media papers.
[03:53:02.628 --> 03:53:03.828]  Barely a word about it.
[03:53:04.329 --> 03:53:04.529]  Yeah.
[03:53:05.689 --> 03:53:06.569]  Got them right here.
[03:53:08.670 --> 03:53:10.691]  The toilet paper record.
[03:53:10.711 --> 03:53:11.331]  Where did I put it?
[03:53:12.891 --> 03:53:23.575]  About that guy that all about that Novani Novani
[03:53:24.864 --> 03:53:27.425]  Thorn in Putin's side dies in Arctic prison.
[03:53:28.445 --> 03:53:32.106]  Trump must pay $355 million in fines.
[03:53:32.406 --> 03:53:33.646]  This is Saturday's New York Times.
[03:53:34.747 --> 03:53:37.908]  Russia loses a potent voice against the war.
[03:53:39.188 --> 03:53:41.429]  Trump is set to favor limits for abortion.
[03:53:42.689 --> 03:53:45.570]  Biden sees rift in towns stung by derailing.
[03:53:47.990 --> 03:53:53.672]  Not a word about the mass slaughter going on in Israel.
[03:53:55.999 --> 03:54:01.162]  Of the Palestinians, which by definition is genocide in Gaza.
[03:54:02.163 --> 03:54:02.443]  Nothing.
[03:54:03.564 --> 03:54:16.172]  And it's day after day, page after page, about this guy, Novani, sharpest thorn in Putin's side, dies in prison.
[03:54:16.613 --> 03:54:18.014]  Page after page.
[03:54:18.914 --> 03:54:23.017]  Hey, how about Julian Assange, huh?
[03:54:25.799 --> 03:54:31.342]  How about that reporter, the American reporter that was killed by the Ukrainians?
[03:54:32.303 --> 03:54:33.343]  That ain't gonna count.
[03:54:37.466 --> 03:54:40.828]  Day after day, that is the news.
[03:54:41.768 --> 03:54:50.654]  And that's why, by the way, you subscribe to the Trends Journal, because we're giving you news you can use, history before it happens.
[03:54:51.674 --> 03:54:52.675]  Here, today's
[03:54:54.206 --> 03:54:56.387]  Toilet paper record, the New York Times, Monday.
[03:55:00.068 --> 03:55:03.770]  Scenes of Armageddon as Ukrainian city falls.
[03:55:06.451 --> 03:55:09.112]  A ranch family border crisis is right outside the back door.
[03:55:12.794 --> 03:55:13.234]  Here we go.
[03:55:13.734 --> 03:55:17.216]  Russia targets those grieving Navalny's death.
[03:55:19.256 --> 03:55:19.517]  U.S.
[03:55:19.557 --> 03:55:22.678]  disquieted as Russia eyes arms
[03:55:23.188 --> 03:55:28.450]  In space, Russia, Russia, Russia, and of course, going after Trump as they do every day.
[03:55:35.433 --> 03:55:35.934]  There you got it.
[03:55:36.054 --> 03:55:38.755]  In real estate, a certain name is losing lust.
[03:55:38.775 --> 03:55:39.415]  That's about Trump.
[03:55:39.895 --> 03:55:40.956]  Not Armageddon?
[03:55:42.076 --> 03:55:45.778]  How about the Armageddon in Gaza?
[03:55:48.379 --> 03:55:52.281]  And America is now saying they will not support a ceasefire.
[03:55:53.618 --> 03:55:55.500]  So then you've got to put everything together here.
[03:55:56.580 --> 03:56:00.564]  You saw the new data coming out about America's going deeper in debt.
[03:56:01.364 --> 03:56:08.550]  The country rotting in front of our eyes, taking a ride on Amtrak's third world, New York City's a night in Calcutta, the subways.
[03:56:10.832 --> 03:56:12.633]  Migrants flooding into the country.
[03:56:13.754 --> 03:56:15.375]  Businesses going out of business.
[03:56:15.395 --> 03:56:18.098]  63% of the people living paycheck to paycheck.
[03:56:21.160 --> 03:56:22.021]  But more money
[03:56:23.072 --> 03:56:30.217]  Going to the military industrial complex to be sent over to Ukraine and Israel to keep bloodying the killing fields.
[03:56:31.498 --> 03:56:33.540]  Stealing our money to do this.
[03:56:33.700 --> 03:56:35.241]  Oh, today's President's Day.
[03:56:36.161 --> 03:56:50.612]  How about honoring a real president by the name of George Washington who warned the American people in his farewell address
[03:56:53.194 --> 03:57:01.396]  Do not become a slave to any country, and you will do it if you love a nation or hate a nation.
[03:57:01.416 --> 03:57:02.976]  I had it right here somewhere.
[03:57:05.877 --> 03:57:16.159]  And he goes on to make it very, very clear that we have no right being in these foreign entanglements that have been going on, he said, for centuries.
[03:57:17.259 --> 03:57:19.980]  Again, don't love a nation, don't hate a nation.
[03:57:20.492 --> 03:57:23.333]  If you do, either one, you became a slave to them.
[03:57:24.294 --> 03:57:25.675]  This is President's Day.
[03:57:26.635 --> 03:57:40.102]  Hey, all you little boys and girls in Congress, how about honoring a true man that fought for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, rather than a clown show running in front of everybody's eyes?
[03:57:40.122 --> 03:57:41.623]  So again, support us.
[03:57:41.703 --> 03:57:42.543]  We're supporting you.
[03:57:42.583 --> 03:57:44.004]  Go to TrendsJournal.com.
[03:57:46.131 --> 03:57:50.155]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[03:57:50.535 --> 03:57:57.542]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[03:57:57.722 --> 03:57:59.744]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[03:57:59.924 --> 03:58:00.965]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[03:58:01.045 --> 03:58:01.706]  He loved the idea.
[03:58:02.046 --> 03:58:05.550]  What would you call the debate and discussion about a pro-human future?
[03:58:05.590 --> 03:58:06.451]  Just Team Humanity?
[03:58:06.511 --> 03:58:07.412]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[03:58:07.552 --> 03:58:07.992]  Absolutely.
[03:58:08.333 --> 03:58:09.714]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[03:58:09.774 --> 03:58:13.238]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[03:58:13.458 --> 03:58:20.926]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to give InfoWars on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[03:58:21.187 --> 03:58:22.568]  I want to thank you all for your past support.
[03:58:22.568 --> 03:58:22.888]  We're good to go.
[03:58:46.869 --> 03:58:51.173]  The InfoWars Live Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has finally returned.
