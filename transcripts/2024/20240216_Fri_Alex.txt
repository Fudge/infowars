[00:00:04.285 --> 00:00:08.161]  If you are receiving this translation, you are in resistance.
[00:00:15.743 --> 00:00:17.144]  It's Friday, February 16th, 2024.
[00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:23.370]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and the wheels are coming off the New World Order.
[00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:27.213]  The entire system is being revealed to the world.
[00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:35.640]  There are open announcements by publications like the Wall Street Journal that, hey, inflation is your fault and you should just skip meals.
[00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.324]  We're going to be breaking that down next segment and so much more today.
[00:00:40.472 --> 00:00:48.677]  But the first thing I wanted to get into is Fannie Willis and the incredible testimony yesterday and I guess more of it's coming up today and we'll be covering it live.
[00:00:48.737 --> 00:00:57.622]  I mean, here is this corrupt prosecutor that hired her boyfriend, lied about it, and then got caught giving him hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[00:00:58.504 --> 00:00:59.104]  We're good to go.
[00:01:28.496 --> 00:01:40.227]  Of the arrogance of the type of people that George Soros is financing and putting into judgeships, putting into prosecutor positions, putting into state attorney generals positions.
[00:01:40.708 --> 00:01:50.617]  They all basically behave the same because they know their tools of the Justice Department, even if they're state or local, and that they have been given a get out of jail free card.
[00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:52.379]  They are above the law.
[00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:57.682]  Just like Biden and on down to the very, very bottom.
[00:01:58.362 --> 00:02:01.663]  And this is what happens in history when tyrannies take over.
[00:02:01.763 --> 00:02:12.365]  They get enough of their corrupt people in positions of power to be able to commit any crime they want, be as arrogant as they want, as long as they persecute the political opposition.
[00:02:12.705 --> 00:02:21.047]  And our government can point at this stuff going on in China or Russia and say, oh, look, they're bad, but we don't live in China or Russia.
[00:02:21.946 --> 00:02:22.666]  We live here.
[00:02:23.507 --> 00:02:31.011]  And if I saw Republicans doing one-tenth of this to people, weaponizing the judiciary, I'd be totally against them.
[00:02:31.031 --> 00:02:32.491]  In fact, I don't like the Republican leadership.
[00:02:32.972 --> 00:02:34.893]  Mitch McConnell and the rest of them are almost as bad.
[00:02:35.613 --> 00:02:44.217]  But just sitting back and watching her testimony and listening to her, and then her trying to claim that it's racism, the reason all this is happening.
[00:02:45.218 --> 00:02:47.079]  She ran on getting Trump.
[00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:51.181]  So did Letitia James in New York, the...
[00:02:52.568 --> 00:02:57.973]  This absolute political operative judge in New York on the real estate case has already found Trump guilty.
[00:02:58.394 --> 00:02:59.575]  There is no jury.
[00:02:59.956 --> 00:03:01.857]  And so that verdict is set to come out today.
[00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:04.173]  They're coming for everybody, folks.
[00:03:04.273 --> 00:03:07.735]  As Trump said, they have to get through him to get to us.
[00:03:07.775 --> 00:03:10.676]  They have to get through InfoWars to get to you.
[00:03:11.096 --> 00:03:15.259]  That's why I'm asking you all to stand up, to speak out, and to support this broadcast.
[00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:22.002]  And tell everybody you know and those you don't know, random strangers, to tune in now at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:03:22.363 --> 00:03:27.666]  We're going to go to break, but here's a clip of Fannie Willis, a short compilation, and we'll be right back.
[00:03:28.026 --> 00:03:29.927]  And she's reportedly going to be back on the stand today.
[00:03:30.933 --> 00:03:31.334]  To tell you...
[00:03:44.372 --> 00:03:45.953]  I just have cash in my house.
[00:03:45.993 --> 00:03:47.174]  I don't have as much today.
[00:03:47.514 --> 00:03:51.036]  And then he tells me how much it is, and I give him the money back.
[00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:55.359]  I don't, just like you're asking me about the money with Robin, I don't do my friends like that.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.822]  So if you tell me it's a G, then you're going to get $1,000.
[00:03:58.982 --> 00:04:01.864]  Whatever it is, I didn't ever make him produce receipts to me.
[00:04:01.924 --> 00:04:04.165]  Whatever he told me it was, I gave him the money back.
[00:04:04.906 --> 00:04:08.348]  I'm not going to emasculate a black man, but I'm just telling you.
[00:04:08.388 --> 00:04:09.069]  I'm sorry, what?
[00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:12.791]  I'm not going to emasculate a black man.
[00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:13.892]  Did you understand that?
[00:04:14.844 --> 00:04:17.025]  Well, I don't think we should discuss further.
[00:04:17.745 --> 00:04:21.806]  He also said that he was a world traveler and had been on many of the continents.
[00:04:23.266 --> 00:04:25.207]  Have you been on any of those continents with him?
[00:04:26.607 --> 00:04:27.508]  Besides this one?
[00:04:28.628 --> 00:04:29.328]  Where's Belize?
[00:04:29.528 --> 00:04:30.269]  What continent is that?
[00:04:30.329 --> 00:04:31.029]  I'm not being funny.
[00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:31.389]  I don't know.
[00:04:32.528 --> 00:04:35.472]  I've been to the Belize with him.
[00:04:35.852 --> 00:04:37.073]  I've been to the Bahamas with him.
[00:04:37.514 --> 00:04:38.775]  I've been with Aruba with him.
[00:04:38.935 --> 00:04:39.816]  Don't embarrass me.
[00:04:39.976 --> 00:04:41.518]  I'm not sure what continents those are on.
[00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.221]  Whatever continents those are, that's where I've been.
[00:04:44.261 --> 00:04:46.123]  I'm sure if I gave it some thought, I would tell you.
[00:04:46.143 --> 00:04:50.328]  But whatever continents those are, I've been to those locations, sir.
[00:05:00.711 --> 00:05:01.612]  Hello, Americans.
[00:05:02.412 --> 00:05:04.033]  I want to share with you a story.
[00:05:04.673 --> 00:05:10.817]  A story about inflammation, the silent menace that lurks within our bodies, affecting our health and well-being.
[00:05:11.998 --> 00:05:17.801]  Inflammation, the root cause of countless ailments, quietly wreaking havoc over time.
[00:05:18.861 --> 00:05:26.486]  Long-term exposure to inflammation has been linked to a myriad of health issues, from heart disease to arthritis, even cognitive decline.
[00:05:27.543 --> 00:05:35.116]  But fear not, for there's a beacon of hope found in the wisdom of nature, a remedy that has stood the test of time, turmeric.
[00:05:35.911 --> 00:05:49.224]  And now I present to you Baudis from InfoWarsStore.com, a powerful blend crafted with precision-boasting 95% curcuminoids extracted from turmeric.
[00:05:49.324 --> 00:05:51.326]  It's good for your heart, your brain, everything.
[00:05:51.466 --> 00:05:58.593]  It is 40% off, back in stock, Baudis Ultimate Turmeric Formula, InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:18.117]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.732]  It's Friday, February 16th, 2024.
[00:06:25.672 --> 00:06:30.955]  And I want to kick the broadcast off with this headline in your face from the Wall Street Journal.
[00:06:31.675 --> 00:06:34.516]  To save money, maybe you should skip breakfast.
[00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:39.138]  And the Atlantic says you should eat beans instead of meat.
[00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:46.301]  Ladies and gentlemen, they are building a giant dystopic system in our faces.
[00:06:48.914 --> 00:06:50.876]  We're about to break it down right now.
[00:06:51.316 --> 00:06:52.897]  This is the Great Reset.
[00:06:53.258 --> 00:06:55.379]  This is the post-industrial world.
[00:06:55.739 --> 00:06:58.781]  This is the depopulation system in our face.
[00:07:02.704 --> 00:07:04.786]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:07:05.366 --> 00:07:10.550]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:07:18.257 --> 00:07:35.266]  Zero Hedge has written a short but also very succinct and powerful boil-down of a composite of Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal articles, WUF statements, and White House propaganda in the last few weeks and months.
[00:07:35.946 --> 00:07:40.008]  And so I'm just going to read the article here on air for you right now.
[00:07:40.609 --> 00:07:42.430]  It's also posted on Infowars.com.
[00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:46.072]  Before I read it, it's very important to understand and to pull back
[00:07:47.202 --> 00:07:57.791]  And just read the headline for yourself to take in the arrogance of these people and what their Great Reset really means.
[00:07:58.532 --> 00:08:01.495]  Wall Street Journal tells readers to save money.
[00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:04.798]  Maybe you should skip breakfast.
[00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:05.658]  Again, I'm going to read that again.
[00:08:05.678 --> 00:08:09.041]  The Wall Street Journal tells readers to save money.
[00:08:09.542 --> 00:08:11.623]  Maybe you should skip breakfast.
[00:08:12.816 --> 00:08:26.633]  Now remember, cutting off much of the fertilizer, shutting down many of the farms around the world, this is all good to save the earth from climate change because particularly organic farming is bad.
[00:08:26.753 --> 00:08:28.054]  Factory farming is good.
[00:08:28.795 --> 00:08:32.877]  That's the UN and London Guardian and many other establishment mouthpieces openly saying that.
[00:08:32.897 --> 00:08:36.699]  Of course, this all flies in the face of common sense and reality.
[00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:41.481]  Then, separately, the UN comes out and says, oh, hundreds of millions are going to starve to death.
[00:08:42.161 --> 00:08:49.844]  UNICEF needs billions and billions of dollars more because the virus caused a breakdown in food production.
[00:08:49.864 --> 00:08:50.825]  No, the lockdowns.
[00:08:51.946 --> 00:08:53.607]  That went on for all these years, did that.
[00:08:54.288 --> 00:08:55.428]  And now, oh, guess what?
[00:08:55.488 --> 00:08:59.371]  They didn't end when it comes to farms and food production around the world.
[00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:05.375]  In fact, the controls incrementally shutting down that key infrastructure have only intensified.
[00:09:05.455 --> 00:09:11.539]  So imagine the globalist party, the WFUN Trillionaire Club.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.722]  And their slogan is, you will eat the bucks.
[00:09:16.443 --> 00:09:17.123]  You will own nothing.
[00:09:17.143 --> 00:09:17.784]  You will like it.
[00:09:17.824 --> 00:09:19.185]  And you say, that's so dystopic.
[00:09:19.705 --> 00:09:20.786]  They'll never get away with that.
[00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:29.477]  That they are, to some extent, because the public is so incredibly ignorant about the nature of just how evil this plan is.
[00:09:29.497 --> 00:09:47.332]  Because even though they're saying we've broken the social contract, even though they're saying we're shutting down the normal infrastructure and killing oil drilling and gas production, even though they're shutting off the coal, even though they're saying the West isn't open for business, but it sure is in China and India, where their investments are,
[00:09:48.226 --> 00:09:59.988]  The public still hasn't wrapped their mind around the fact that this is administrative deindustrialization, which will lead to poverty, crime, and death, especially in the third world.
[00:10:00.628 --> 00:10:02.209]  So here's the amazing headline.
[00:10:02.569 --> 00:10:04.629]  Wall Street Journal tells readers to save money.
[00:10:05.329 --> 00:10:06.890]  Maybe you should skip breakfast.
[00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:07.930]  That's how you save money.
[00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:13.951]  As the number of Bidenomics news stories soared,
[00:10:15.165 --> 00:10:20.867]  Polling data via RealClearPolitics shows the president's job approval rating fell.
[00:10:21.227 --> 00:10:27.730]  In other words, the American people quickly called BS on the PR report.
[00:10:29.125 --> 00:10:29.865]  We're good to go.
[00:10:48.956 --> 00:10:55.578]  Then they'll get the blame, and then we'll call for corporations and international groups to come in and fix the problem.
[00:10:55.618 --> 00:11:14.384]  But if we know it's the globalists that penetrated our governments and the cabinets that control our politicians, and that it's a global WFUN party doing this worldwide, well, they'll all be discredited, their programs will be stopped, and then finally we'll take political power and be able to legally and lawfully, with due process, put their asses in prison.
[00:11:15.956 --> 00:11:23.585]  Continuing, according to Bloomberg data, the number of news stories mentioning Bidenomics in corporate media erupted in June of 2023.
[00:11:23.625 --> 00:11:34.317]  This was around the same time that the White House launched its propaganda campaign to persuade, trick the American people about the alleged success of the President's economic policies.
[00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:43.000]  As the number of Bidenomics news stories soared, polling data via RealClearPolitics shows the President's job approval rating rate fell.
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:47.962]  In other words, the American people quickly called BS on the PR campaign.
[00:11:51.023 --> 00:11:51.603]  Continuing.
[00:11:53.924 --> 00:11:58.545]  In this era of failure, legacy media told consumers inflation is their fault.
[00:11:59.366 --> 00:12:09.694]  But ignore the Federal Reserve's massive easing program during the COVID era and the federal government's helicopter dropping trillions of dollars blindly across the economy.
[00:12:10.154 --> 00:12:13.757]  Not quite blindly, most of it to key globalist banks and to themselves.
[00:12:13.797 --> 00:12:18.801]  Then they do the real investment, buy up the infrastructure and pass us all the debt and inflation.
[00:12:19.522 --> 00:12:21.223]  Here's the Atlantic's headline.
[00:12:21.983 --> 00:12:23.465]  Inflation is your fault.
[00:12:24.165 --> 00:12:30.315]  If people are so mad about high prices, why do they keep buying so many expensive things?
[00:12:31.488 --> 00:12:34.290]  Of course, that publication is a big apologist for Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:39.173]  Oh, because the owner is a big visitor to it, Steve Jobs' widow.
[00:12:39.913 --> 00:12:53.662]  Remember this Bloomberg opinion piece from 2022 that told readers who made under $300,000 a year and suffered from high inflation, try lentils, beans, instead of meat.
[00:12:54.783 --> 00:12:56.044]  Here's that headline from Bloomberg.
[00:12:56.664 --> 00:12:57.785]  Inflation stings.
[00:12:57.905 --> 00:12:59.446]  Most of you earn less meat.
[00:13:01.057 --> 00:13:02.879]  $300,000.
[00:13:01.517 --> 00:13:02.879]  Here's how to deal with it.
[00:13:03.579 --> 00:13:05.221]  Ah, yes, earn less.
[00:13:05.281 --> 00:13:05.921]  That will fix it.
[00:13:06.502 --> 00:13:07.143]  Take the bus.
[00:13:08.384 --> 00:13:09.165]  Don't buy in bulk.
[00:13:09.645 --> 00:13:11.247]  Everybody knows if you buy in bulk, you save money.
[00:13:11.567 --> 00:13:13.189]  See, just all the worst advice.
[00:13:13.789 --> 00:13:17.773]  It's like telling a kid that can't swim that's three years old, top bowling balls to your legs and jump on the deep end.
[00:13:18.374 --> 00:13:19.695]  Try lentils instead of meat.
[00:13:20.135 --> 00:13:22.478]  Nobody said this would be fun.
[00:13:24.188 --> 00:13:30.209]  I told everybody when they shut the economy down and people sat around watching Netflix that it was pulling the rug out from under the economy.
[00:13:30.249 --> 00:13:31.190]  It was all part of their plan.
[00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:38.811]  And now the Wall Street Journal told readers this week to save money, maybe you should skip breakfast.
[00:13:38.831 --> 00:13:42.972]  Of course, how about you skip all three meals in areas of Latin America, Africa, and starve to death?
[00:13:44.013 --> 00:13:49.714]  Only the strongest military-aged men can be transferred by the UN to our nations.
[00:13:51.573 --> 00:13:57.155]  As another reminder, lower inflation touted by the White House does not mean lower prices.
[00:13:57.175 --> 00:13:58.576]  We'll put that graph on screen.
[00:13:59.336 --> 00:14:03.598]  And the consumer environment is getting worse, not better, ahead of the elections.
[00:14:04.218 --> 00:14:07.379]  The Atlantic pointing fingers at consumers for inflation.
[00:14:07.399 --> 00:14:09.560]  Bloomberg advised readers to eat lentils.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.442]  The Wall Street Journal suggests skipping breakfast are all indicators of the U.S.
[00:14:13.482 --> 00:14:14.282]  economy in distress.
[00:14:14.682 --> 00:14:18.964]  In stark contrast, the White House's continuous assurance that everything is fine.
[00:14:21.184 --> 00:14:23.165]  So, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:23.205 --> 00:14:26.506]  Just go read that short article at infoawards.com or zeroedge.com.
[00:14:27.126 --> 00:14:28.007]  Share it with everybody you know.
[00:14:28.027 --> 00:14:28.707]  I'm going to post it.
[00:14:28.727 --> 00:14:32.949]  I have this audio report on X. Obviously, I'm airing it here on my show today.
[00:14:32.969 --> 00:14:36.470]  I've got more of these reports coming today, and I'll be back live at Studio Sunday.
[00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:38.251]  Owen and the rest of the crew are doing a great job today.
[00:14:38.311 --> 00:14:47.855]  But just sit back and think about for a moment, cogitate, meditate on the arrogance of the corporate dying media
[00:14:48.803 --> 00:14:57.872]  With articles in Cosmopolitan about, have a baby, go to a satanic temple abortion clinic, and they will sacrifice it with you.
[00:14:57.992 --> 00:15:03.899]  They actually have satanic-sponsored abortion clinics now where women go to say it's a sacrifice.
[00:15:04.679 --> 00:15:10.165]  And the New York Times and all these groups are pushing this, and you're like, well, that's just completely over the top.
[00:15:10.185 --> 00:15:10.886]  They're trolling us.
[00:15:11.781 --> 00:15:20.985]  No, they're getting ready for a post-industrial world and training you to not stand together and training you to be nihilistic and satanic like they are.
[00:15:21.526 --> 00:15:24.507]  These are mercenaries and minions and servants of the system.
[00:15:25.067 --> 00:15:25.767]  Some of them love it.
[00:15:26.268 --> 00:15:27.308]  Some of them just go along with it.
[00:15:27.648 --> 00:15:34.712]  But in the final equation, they have sold out to their own destruction and hell loves company.
[00:15:35.452 --> 00:15:37.073]  Misery loves company.
[00:15:37.935 --> 00:15:42.283]  And as I started this important breakdown, I'm going to end with this again.
[00:15:43.466 --> 00:15:49.116]  The globalists are trying to sell sand to people in the Sahara instead of iced tea.
[00:15:50.543 --> 00:15:51.604]  This is unpopular.
[00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:52.564]  This is evil.
[00:15:52.904 --> 00:15:53.705]  This is wrong.
[00:15:54.105 --> 00:15:55.265]  It doesn't save the Earth.
[00:15:55.946 --> 00:15:57.426]  The globalists don't care about the Earth.
[00:15:57.887 --> 00:16:10.032]  They are positioning themselves for mass forced depopulation, climate lockdowns, race wars, and other nightmarish systems they're putting into place all around us.
[00:16:10.493 --> 00:16:12.694]  So whatever you see on national television,
[00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:33.688]  Whatever you see Disney's putting out, whatever you see as drug commercials, whatever you see being put out by the big colleges, all of it is written up by the big think tanks and is designed to poison you, is designed to destroy you, is literally designed to kill you after they suck everything out of you, including your soul.
[00:16:34.591 --> 00:16:35.051]  We're good to go.
[00:17:05.391 --> 00:17:07.633]  But if they want to fight, they better believe they've got one.
[00:17:08.093 --> 00:17:10.835]  Back to live broadcast, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:17:12.936 --> 00:17:13.716]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:17:15.217 --> 00:17:19.660]  And yes, we are now inside the InfoWars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.500]  Owen Troyer here.
[00:17:21.521 --> 00:17:25.483]  Joining you, going to be rejoined by Alex coming up shortly.
[00:17:26.864 --> 00:17:28.405]  And he's got a bunch of news.
[00:17:29.565 --> 00:17:30.686]  I've got a bunch of news.
[00:17:32.367 --> 00:17:33.768]  And there's so many stories that
[00:17:35.902 --> 00:17:36.502]  We're good to go.
[00:18:00.157 --> 00:18:13.603]  You might want to start thinking about how you're going to protect your family and what type of insurance you can have to make sure you aren't in a position where you're starved out.
[00:18:14.883 --> 00:18:19.765]  I'm not going to turn this into a long plug, but this is just the reality of the situation that we live in.
[00:18:20.846 --> 00:18:23.147]  You might want to get storable foods.
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.302]  And yeah, we sell storable foods.
[00:18:27.003 --> 00:18:29.686]  Because we like having storable food.
[00:18:29.766 --> 00:18:32.168]  Because we like having an emergency food supply.
[00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:33.850]  And we want you to have the same.
[00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:39.876]  So we went out and found the highest quality emergency food supplies at the lowest price.
[00:18:40.097 --> 00:18:43.460]  And that's what we deliver for you at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:44.261]  And there's options.
[00:18:44.321 --> 00:18:44.842]  There's the year.
[00:18:46.676 --> 00:18:47.757]  Long food supply.
[00:18:47.777 --> 00:18:48.837]  There's the six-month.
[00:18:48.977 --> 00:18:49.978]  There's the three-month.
[00:18:50.038 --> 00:18:51.018]  There's the four-week.
[00:18:51.078 --> 00:18:54.420]  And there's all kinds of other sub-options inside of that as well.
[00:18:54.881 --> 00:18:57.162]  Highest quality storable foods at the lowest price.
[00:18:57.182 --> 00:18:58.763]  25-year shelf life.
[00:18:59.223 --> 00:19:01.304]  Comes in a high-quality container as well.
[00:19:01.464 --> 00:19:03.325]  So, I mean, it's immediately ready for storage.
[00:19:04.086 --> 00:19:06.387]  And it's insurance you can eat.
[00:19:08.308 --> 00:19:10.249]  You'd rather have it and not need it.
[00:19:11.601 --> 00:19:14.002]  Then need it and not have it.
[00:19:14.723 --> 00:19:19.245]  So do your emergency food supply shopping at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:19:19.265 --> 00:19:20.105]  And who knows what it could be?
[00:19:20.245 --> 00:19:26.949]  War, power grid shutdown, even just major weather catastrophe, what have you.
[00:19:27.069 --> 00:19:27.769]  That happens too.
[00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:32.232]  Or, you know, just Democrats, our government, globalists ruining the country.
[00:19:34.033 --> 00:19:37.574]  But it's your support at InfoWarsStore.com that keeps this transmission on the air.
[00:19:37.674 --> 00:19:37.995]  All right.
[00:19:38.315 --> 00:19:38.455]  Now...
[00:19:40.026 --> 00:19:40.606]  I think we're good to go.
[00:20:05.168 --> 00:20:05.749]  We're good to go.
[00:20:05.769 --> 00:20:06.509]  We're good to go.
[00:20:31.007 --> 00:20:35.290]  You ask a diehard Democrat liberal, they'll tell you Joe Biden is the greatest thing since sliced bread.
[00:20:36.111 --> 00:20:37.312]  Greatest economy ever.
[00:20:37.793 --> 00:20:39.734]  There's peace on planet Earth thanks to Joe Biden.
[00:20:39.774 --> 00:20:41.195]  It's just total reverse reality.
[00:20:41.716 --> 00:20:43.517]  Totally fully bought into the propaganda.
[00:20:43.537 --> 00:20:44.318]  Just total BS.
[00:20:44.878 --> 00:20:46.680]  And they say the same thing about Fannie Willis.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.041]  Greatest testimony ever.
[00:20:48.381 --> 00:20:52.965]  She showed how brave and how courageous and how strong and smart and everything.
[00:20:53.685 --> 00:20:55.086]  And the truth is the exact opposite.
[00:20:55.126 --> 00:20:56.127]  She embarrassed herself.
[00:20:57.168 --> 00:20:58.209]  She embarrassed her family.
[00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:00.551]  And she was so bad...
[00:21:02.056 --> 00:21:05.078]  I mean, just a neutral observer would see how bad she was.
[00:21:05.919 --> 00:21:12.503]  She was so bad that they didn't bring her back up to the stand today.
[00:21:15.365 --> 00:21:28.575]  Now, her father was up there, and he has nothing to do with this, but clearly he sees what's going on, and it appears that Fannie Willis was, yes,
[00:21:29.631 --> 00:21:34.593]  Moving a bunch of money around, perhaps even admitting to committing campaign finance violations.
[00:21:37.133 --> 00:21:37.794]  Crazy enough.
[00:21:39.714 --> 00:21:56.060]  And taking vacations with her romantic partner, even though she promised Fulton County when she got the job and sit-down interview, she said, I promise I'll never have romantic relationships with anybody who I work with.
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:56.540]  Oops.
[00:21:58.413 --> 00:21:58.693]  Oops.
[00:21:59.614 --> 00:22:07.379]  And then they allegedly lied about that in the court filings because other witnesses came up and said, nope, they'd been in a relationship before 2020.
[00:22:07.799 --> 00:22:14.924]  And I'd seen them smooching and hugging.
[00:22:17.506 --> 00:22:27.052]  And as if that's not all embarrassing enough for Fannie, she wore her dress backwards.
[00:22:29.728 --> 00:22:37.151]  And, you know, obviously I'm not some big fashion, female fashion critique artist here or something.
[00:22:37.531 --> 00:22:38.431]  But it's funny.
[00:22:38.892 --> 00:22:42.193]  When I saw her in the dress, I was like, something feels off about this.
[00:22:42.973 --> 00:22:45.034]  Is it just her body shape or what's the deal?
[00:22:45.594 --> 00:22:48.415]  Well, some women noticed.
[00:22:48.595 --> 00:22:49.836]  They found the dress.
[00:22:50.856 --> 00:22:52.957]  They found the website where you can buy the dress.
[00:22:53.237 --> 00:22:57.979]  And yes, indeed, Fanny Willis was wearing it backwards.
[00:22:59.312 --> 00:23:02.193]  But maybe she's just taken from Jill Biden, because Jill Biden is famous for that, too.
[00:23:04.554 --> 00:23:08.616]  Now, there's so much more here.
[00:23:09.336 --> 00:23:14.798]  I'm going to let Alex tell some other of these stories when it comes to the situation with Alexei Navalny.
[00:23:16.079 --> 00:23:18.780]  I mean, I just say quickly, like, I don't know what to think.
[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:21.081]  I could easily see Putin actually doing this.
[00:23:22.782 --> 00:23:27.744]  The timing seems way too convenient for the deep state and the military-industrial complex.
[00:23:28.729 --> 00:23:29.189]  We're good to go.
[00:23:29.209 --> 00:23:30.490]  We're good to go.
[00:23:59.147 --> 00:24:02.930]  To the deep state and military-industrial complex to continue their war on Russia.
[00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:04.030]  But you know what?
[00:24:05.571 --> 00:24:09.334]  How about, did Putin have Navalny killed or not?
[00:24:10.154 --> 00:24:11.135]  How about I don't care?
[00:24:12.976 --> 00:24:19.861]  How about we've had five January 6th political prisoners kill themselves because of what the Democrats have done?
[00:24:20.241 --> 00:24:24.924]  How about we had Ukraine kill journalist Gonzalo Lira, American journalist?
[00:24:24.944 --> 00:24:25.525]  How about that?
[00:24:27.808 --> 00:24:31.549]  Neither of those stories got any of the attention.
[00:24:32.249 --> 00:24:36.830]  Not a fraction of the attention that this Novani story has.
[00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:41.531]  Which would again lead me to believe that it's just propaganda or something else going on.
[00:24:42.151 --> 00:24:45.112]  But why is it we don't care about Gonzalo Lira?
[00:24:46.152 --> 00:24:49.713]  Why is it we don't care about the American political prisoners that have been killed?
[00:24:55.714 --> 00:24:55.994]  So...
[00:24:57.228 --> 00:25:11.871]  Then you had Tucker, who's I guess still in Russia, shooting videos at the supermarkets and the subway stations and comparing life in American cities to Russian cities and saying, hey, what do you notice here?
[00:25:11.911 --> 00:25:12.571]  What's the difference?
[00:25:12.651 --> 00:25:13.511]  Oh, there's no poverty.
[00:25:13.551 --> 00:25:14.351]  There's no crime.
[00:25:14.371 --> 00:25:15.251]  There's no graffiti.
[00:25:15.872 --> 00:25:18.572]  People respect the streets and they respect each other.
[00:25:18.792 --> 00:25:21.013]  You just don't get that in American cities.
[00:25:21.053 --> 00:25:23.133]  So we'll probably play some of that coming up.
[00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:32.073]  We've got the Democrats continuing to run on the abortion issue.
[00:25:32.093 --> 00:25:34.975]  This is going to be their big issue for 2024 is abortion.
[00:25:34.995 --> 00:25:38.657]  They've changed their tack a little bit, but we'll have that coming up for you.
[00:25:39.278 --> 00:25:44.281]  We got a ton of clips from the Fannie Willis, Nathan Wade testimony.
[00:25:44.341 --> 00:25:48.864]  I mean, it'd be funny if it wasn't so pathetic.
[00:25:49.164 --> 00:25:52.146]  It'd be funny if it wasn't...
[00:25:54.508 --> 00:26:01.012]  So scary that these people are in charge and they will illegally and illegitimately persecute you.
[00:26:01.952 --> 00:26:03.874]  It might be funny, but that's what's going on.
[00:26:03.914 --> 00:26:04.814]  So we got all of those clips.
[00:26:04.834 --> 00:26:05.835]  We're going to play those too.
[00:26:07.756 --> 00:26:11.578]  Now, let me do something here before we go to break and get rejoined by Alex on the other side.
[00:26:11.698 --> 00:26:19.042]  This is the most current polling results when it comes to the 2024 election.
[00:26:22.025 --> 00:26:22.425]  We're good to go.
[00:26:22.445 --> 00:26:22.926]  We're good to go.
[00:26:43.871 --> 00:26:47.374]  Ladies and gentlemen, these are the real results.
[00:26:48.055 --> 00:26:53.199]  Before all the Biden voter fraud, these are the real results of the 2020 election.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:27:01.506]  Donald Trump won Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona.
[00:27:02.728 --> 00:27:19.919]  Before all the voter fraud came in, before all the mail-in ballots came in, before the water main breaks and the mail delivery trucks and the pulling out secret briefcases from under the table when the counting was supposed to stop, midnight when Trump was leading in all those states, but then at 3.30 Biden had the 1% lead.
[00:27:22.421 --> 00:27:28.025]  These were your real results from the 2020 election.
[00:27:28.825 --> 00:27:32.348]  Donald Trump had over 300 electoral college votes.
[00:27:33.968 --> 00:27:34.869]  Those are your real results.
[00:27:37.531 --> 00:27:43.075]  But see, everybody's seeing this today and saying, oh look, Trump has a commanding lead on Biden.
[00:27:44.456 --> 00:27:46.097]  Oh look, the Democrats are in trouble.
[00:27:47.518 --> 00:27:49.320]  Well yeah, of course they are.
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:51.341]  The economy's in bad shape.
[00:27:53.043 --> 00:27:54.564]  There's war all over the planet.
[00:27:55.264 --> 00:27:57.226]  People don't even feel safe in their own cities.
[00:27:58.427 --> 00:27:59.227]  You can go on and on.
[00:27:59.788 --> 00:28:03.491]  The constant lying, gaslighting, the border, everything else we get.
[00:28:04.343 --> 00:28:05.584]  We got news on the border as well.
[00:28:07.325 --> 00:28:11.429]  No, these were your results from the 2020 election right here.
[00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:16.232]  That's what you have before all the voter fraud.
[00:28:18.234 --> 00:28:19.475]  It's exactly where we were at.
[00:28:21.557 --> 00:28:25.260]  And then Joe Biden had millions of illegitimate votes pour in
[00:28:26.556 --> 00:28:31.219]  At 3 o'clock in the morning to put him ahead in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:37.043]  But we don't need to sit here and relitigate this on air.
[00:28:37.083 --> 00:28:38.224]  We already know what happened.
[00:28:38.604 --> 00:28:40.305]  Anybody paying attention knows what happened.
[00:28:40.705 --> 00:28:47.270]  But then I'm supposed to care about Putin and Mulvaney when my own government throws me in jail for telling you that.
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:57.305]  So, whatever happened in Albany, yeah, we can talk about it, but no, we've got our own problems with the Biden administration, much bigger than Putin problems.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:00.761]  I'm not perfect.
[00:29:00.781 --> 00:29:01.581]  I'm under a lot of stress.
[00:29:01.621 --> 00:29:05.845]  But if I didn't have the supplements we have, we promote, I wouldn't be able to continue to be on air.
[00:29:06.425 --> 00:29:14.552]  And when you go to InfoWarsStore.com, you are funding the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists in an operation that the enemy admits has been the most effective at exposing them.
[00:29:14.752 --> 00:29:16.313]  Because we're fearless and we don't back down.
[00:29:16.714 --> 00:29:17.675]  We got God on our side.
[00:29:17.995 --> 00:29:19.516]  But God needs to work through you.
[00:29:19.856 --> 00:29:23.860]  You've got to make the decision to get great products you already need at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.161]  And that is a 360 win.
[00:29:25.741 --> 00:29:28.724]  Nitric Boost, without even knowing, became our number three bestseller.
[00:29:29.384 --> 00:29:30.345]  We're good to go.
[00:29:46.804 --> 00:29:50.707]  So I could never offer nitric boosts because it cost us so much to make.
[00:29:51.508 --> 00:29:53.749]  And now we can offer it for 40% off.
[00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:57.212]  Infowarsstore.com nitric boosts finally back in stock.
[00:29:57.232 --> 00:29:58.473]  40% off out of the gates.
[00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:02.911]  Gunther in Tennessee.
[00:30:02.951 --> 00:30:03.992]  Thanks for calling, Gunther.
[00:30:04.152 --> 00:30:04.493]  Hey, Alex.
[00:30:04.693 --> 00:30:05.434]  First time caller.
[00:30:05.534 --> 00:30:07.375]  Real quick, wanted to plug your foundational energy.
[00:30:07.916 --> 00:30:08.877]  Just started taking that.
[00:30:09.558 --> 00:30:12.640]  And, boy, three pills, regular recommended dose.
[00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:13.862]  I was bouncing off the walls.
[00:30:13.982 --> 00:30:19.607]  But I tell you, foundational is the right name for that product because I'll cut down to one.
[00:30:20.047 --> 00:30:24.472]  It's like you have a baseline of energy that you were missing before that you got back.
[00:30:24.612 --> 00:30:24.712]  So...
[00:30:24.872 --> 00:30:33.118]  Well, I'm glad you mentioned that because it's methylfolate, the breakdown of folic acid, and a lot of people, particularly Europeans, don't absorb all of the folic acid.
[00:30:33.378 --> 00:30:34.459]  So it's not a stimulant.
[00:30:34.679 --> 00:30:38.101]  It's a totally natural thing that boosts energy that's foundational.
[00:30:38.381 --> 00:30:40.943]  And was I lying to you or did it not work?
[00:30:41.644 --> 00:30:42.844]  No, it was top-notch.
[00:30:42.884 --> 00:30:46.507]  And I was actually taking Red Pill Plus before, and that's got a little folic acid in it.
[00:30:46.547 --> 00:30:50.349]  I think there was a little buildup from this, but the energy from this was no jitters.
[00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:51.450]  I mean, it's top-notch.
[00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:52.251]  It's a great product.
[00:30:52.674 --> 00:30:53.635]  Well, thank you so much.
[00:30:53.675 --> 00:30:53.995]  Yeah, no.
[00:30:54.095 --> 00:30:57.417]  Folic acid's great and it's in real red pill, but some can't break it down.
[00:30:57.457 --> 00:30:58.477]  This is the breakdown of it.
[00:30:58.557 --> 00:30:59.318]  That's exactly it.
[00:30:59.978 --> 00:31:03.520]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:10.925]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[00:31:11.105 --> 00:31:13.106]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[00:31:13.286 --> 00:31:14.346]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[00:31:14.407 --> 00:31:15.067]  He loved the idea.
[00:31:15.407 --> 00:31:18.929]  What would you call the debate and discussion about a pro-human future?
[00:31:18.949 --> 00:31:19.829]  Just Team Humanity?
[00:31:19.889 --> 00:31:20.770]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:21.350]  Absolutely.
[00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:23.071]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[00:31:23.151 --> 00:31:26.593]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[00:31:26.813 --> 00:31:34.257]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to give info on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[00:31:34.497 --> 00:31:46.247]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a revolution against the globalists, and it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[00:31:46.527 --> 00:31:47.848]  We're told humans are the problem.
[00:31:47.888 --> 00:31:48.869]  We're told we're killing the Earth.
[00:31:49.149 --> 00:31:53.413]  We're told all this garbage so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[00:31:53.713 --> 00:31:54.414]  We're not going to do that.
[00:31:54.674 --> 00:31:59.318]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[00:32:00.245 --> 00:32:04.547]  The InfoWars Live Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has finally returned.

[00:33:01.388 --> 00:33:07.291]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:28.905]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:29.045 --> 00:33:35.933]  Alexei Navalny, a Russian political prisoner.
[00:33:37.185 --> 00:33:48.352]  One of the main opposition groups against Putin, though he never got more than 2%, collapsed reportedly and died while working at a Siberian work camp in a rural area.
[00:33:49.273 --> 00:33:53.195]  Now, do Russian government officials have people killed?
[00:33:53.215 --> 00:33:55.157]  Yeah, do bears go to the bathroom in the woods?
[00:33:55.857 --> 00:33:56.838]  Do fish swim in the sea?
[00:33:56.858 --> 00:33:57.758]  Do birds fly in the air?
[00:33:58.659 --> 00:34:00.040]  This certainly could have been Putin.
[00:34:01.286 --> 00:34:13.136]  Having him killed, but there he is serving a multi-decade prison sentence and then magically right after the Big Tucker Carlson interview and Russia decisively winning the Ukraine war, this happens.
[00:34:13.577 --> 00:34:15.879]  Where is the motive for Putin to have him killed?
[00:34:16.479 --> 00:34:28.630]  I'm purely speculating here, but how do we know that there wasn't a bounty on his head by Western intelligence agencies and Russia is just as infiltrated as America and that somebody killed him
[00:34:29.921 --> 00:34:30.361]  We're good to go.
[00:34:54.113 --> 00:34:57.474]  Attorney General Barr come out and try to cover it all up.
[00:34:57.534 --> 00:34:59.234]  They turned off the cameras in the prison.
[00:34:59.874 --> 00:35:01.415]  It just goes on and on and on.
[00:35:01.515 --> 00:35:06.056]  So for the West to point their finger at Putin and say, look, look, they're the worst people on earth.
[00:35:06.556 --> 00:35:08.676]  While this type of political murder is going on here.
[00:35:08.696 --> 00:35:11.057]  I mean, look what happened at the Capitol on January 6th.
[00:35:11.077 --> 00:35:20.179]  Look how they gunned a woman down in cold blood claiming shots had been fired and killed four other citizens that day and then lied and said that police
[00:35:21.693 --> 00:35:22.234]  We're good to go.
[00:35:40.851 --> 00:35:46.717]  But if you go to X or go to Facebook or go to the national news, oh, Putin did it for sure, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:47.177 --> 00:35:55.345]  Why would Putin kill somebody who's unpopular, who's in prison, and then give the Western establishment a big win?
[00:35:55.866 --> 00:35:58.568]  This is while Zelensky can't get his war funding through Congress.
[00:35:59.549 --> 00:36:02.472]  This is while he's having to reshuffle generals and leaders.
[00:36:02.973 --> 00:36:04.975]  He's on the verge of being thrown out himself.
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:11.946]  Again, 95% of what I cover on air is researched information and facts.
[00:36:12.987 --> 00:36:13.647]  5% speculation.
[00:36:13.687 --> 00:36:15.169]  I'm saying this is speculation.
[00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:17.391]  And so I don't know what happened there.
[00:36:17.411 --> 00:36:22.256]  But it's definitely food for thought to bring up these different angles and issues that I don't see...
[00:36:23.237 --> 00:36:23.577]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:36:23.597 --> 00:36:27.300]  And I would say I'm kind of on the same page seeing the news about Navalny.
[00:36:52.379 --> 00:37:02.905]  And one of the things you like to do, you don't want to be the tail wagging the dog here, but you always kind of see the response, see the propaganda laid out, and then that might point you in a direction to reach a conclusion here.
[00:37:02.966 --> 00:37:06.428]  So I've got all the same actors that lied to the American people.
[00:37:07.472 --> 00:37:14.741]  I've got all the same actors that engage in propaganda against the American people and they're the ones telling me Putin killed Mulvaney.
[00:37:14.981 --> 00:37:24.393]  Now again, if you say, well, I'm going to assume these people are lying to me all the time and I'm just going to take the opposite as the truth, well, that's also a dangerous psychology because then you can be deceived in that manner.
[00:37:26.021 --> 00:37:32.004]  But you've got Eric Swalwell today telling you, this is the statement he made this morning, rather.
[00:37:32.624 --> 00:37:35.105]  Let Mulvaney's death be a warning to America.
[00:37:35.245 --> 00:37:37.906]  If returned to power, Donald Trump will jail his opponents.
[00:37:38.406 --> 00:37:39.247]  I mean, this is absurd.
[00:37:39.607 --> 00:37:41.428]  Joe Biden is jailing his opponents.
[00:37:43.028 --> 00:37:47.590]  There were thousands put in prison for January 6th.
[00:37:47.791 --> 00:37:49.251]  I was put in prison for my speech.
[00:37:49.651 --> 00:37:50.452]  I was put in prison...
[00:37:51.556 --> 00:37:53.337]  I get harassed from the government regularly, daily.
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:08.682]  I get drug tested, probation meetings, visits.
[00:38:09.362 --> 00:38:11.444]  I have to deal with this corruption of the Biden administration.
[00:38:11.584 --> 00:38:13.825]  And you're going to sit here and tell me, Putin, Putin, Putin.
[00:38:14.546 --> 00:38:16.247]  No, I'm dealing with Biden, Biden, Biden.
[00:38:16.287 --> 00:38:17.468]  I'm dealing with Merrick Garland.
[00:38:17.748 --> 00:38:19.509]  I'm dealing with the corrupt Justice Department.
[00:38:20.169 --> 00:38:22.291]  That's my own country persecuting me.
[00:38:23.651 --> 00:38:24.972]  Did Putin kill Novani or not?
[00:38:25.312 --> 00:38:25.893]  I don't know.
[00:38:26.293 --> 00:38:27.594]  Kind of don't care either.
[00:38:29.635 --> 00:38:30.596]  I got my own problems.
[00:38:32.383 --> 00:38:36.667]  And then they say Trump's going to jail his opponents when that's exactly what the Democrats are doing.
[00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:45.194]  Mike Pence says, there's no room in the Republican Party for apologists for Putin.
[00:38:45.374 --> 00:38:45.594]  Rip.
[00:38:46.215 --> 00:38:47.276]  Alexei Navalny.
[00:38:47.716 --> 00:38:51.179]  Hey, Mike Pence, did you say anything about Gonzalo Lira?
[00:38:52.821 --> 00:38:54.262]  Hey, Mike Pence, read the room.
[00:38:54.802 --> 00:38:58.485]  Actually, there's no room in the Republican Party for you anymore, bud.
[00:38:58.906 --> 00:38:59.927]  You're the one that's out.
[00:39:02.566 --> 00:39:04.387]  Not Putin apologists.
[00:39:07.789 --> 00:39:12.092]  Oh, so Tucker Carlson going over to Russia and doing an interview with Putin, that's a Putin apologist?
[00:39:13.432 --> 00:39:18.535]  Tucker Carlson going over to Russia and filming their grocery stores and their subways, that's a Putin apologist?
[00:39:20.176 --> 00:39:23.839]  Just making observations about Russian civilization and life, that's a Putin apologist?
[00:39:25.099 --> 00:39:26.400]  No, it's embarrassing is what it is.
[00:39:27.081 --> 00:39:30.382]  It's embarrassing because Russians...
[00:39:31.479 --> 00:39:31.999]  We're good to go.
[00:39:32.039 --> 00:39:32.680]  We're good to go.
[00:39:59.468 --> 00:40:03.591]  It looks like a 19th century library or something.
[00:40:04.812 --> 00:40:05.552]  A museum.
[00:40:07.694 --> 00:40:09.495]  Is that a Putin apologist for observing that fact?
[00:40:09.795 --> 00:40:13.738]  Tucker Carlson goes over to Russia, goes to the grocery store, buys groceries.
[00:40:15.119 --> 00:40:19.842]  I guess, I don't know if he has a family of four or whatever, but he says, I'm going to buy enough groceries for a family of four in Russia.
[00:40:19.942 --> 00:40:20.963]  I know what it costs in America.
[00:40:21.243 --> 00:40:23.285]  Oh wow, it's cheaper in Russia and the food quality is better.
[00:40:23.785 --> 00:40:24.726]  Is that a Putin apologist?
[00:40:31.513 --> 00:40:35.175]  When Tucker Carlson goes to the equivalent of McDonald's, because I guess part of the U.S.
[00:40:35.195 --> 00:40:36.596]  sanctions is they don't get McDonald's.
[00:40:36.897 --> 00:40:37.857]  Oh no, how will they survive?
[00:40:38.818 --> 00:40:46.443]  So they came up with their own burger chain, and Tucker goes there, and he buys the equivalent of what would be like a Big Mac meal, and it's seven bucks.
[00:40:50.306 --> 00:40:51.326]  And it doesn't taste like cardboard.
[00:40:51.366 --> 00:40:53.388]  Is that a Putin apologist for just observing these things?
[00:40:55.649 --> 00:40:57.090]  Maybe Putin did have Novani killed.
[00:40:57.671 --> 00:40:59.592]  Doesn't change the fact that their subways are nicer.
[00:41:02.196 --> 00:41:10.142]  And then Mike Pence is going to tell you, no room in the Republican Party for Putin apologists, except everybody staring at Mike Pence in the room saying, hey, why are you still here?
[00:41:11.923 --> 00:41:12.704]  We don't like you.
[00:41:15.366 --> 00:41:16.947]  You're the one we're sick of, actually.
[00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:23.832]  Now, we're going to probably come back...
[00:41:25.296 --> 00:41:33.139]  In the third hour today, and maybe we'll play some of these Tucker Carlson clips, I've also got news on the open border that's out of control.
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:39.001]  And it's exactly as we predicted, confirmed now by NBC News reporting.
[00:41:41.462 --> 00:41:46.364]  Yeah, maybe they'll stop coming to Texas momentarily, but they're just going to go to Arizona and California.
[00:41:46.684 --> 00:41:51.546]  Now it's confirmed, Arizona, California, every day getting a new record number of border crossings.
[00:41:53.283 --> 00:41:54.163]  Oh, yeah.
[00:41:54.443 --> 00:41:54.983]  No kidding.
[00:41:55.444 --> 00:41:56.824]  Oh, you thought they would just stop coming?
[00:41:57.244 --> 00:41:57.524]  Please.
[00:41:58.504 --> 00:41:59.165]  Who thought that?
[00:42:01.165 --> 00:42:01.985]  So we're going to talk about that.
[00:42:02.005 --> 00:42:07.007]  But when we come back in the next segment, I'm going to lay into all these Fannie Willis and Nathan Wade clips.
[00:42:07.047 --> 00:42:09.447]  Some of them are funny, but more than anything, it's just embarrassing.
[00:42:10.447 --> 00:42:11.828]  It's embarrassing for our country.
[00:42:13.588 --> 00:42:16.409]  And I understand this whole concept that, well, you know,
[00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:19.511]  Well, let's just call it what it is.
[00:42:20.052 --> 00:42:28.861]  What else can I assume other than Fannie Willis is a diversity hire, Fannie Willis is a diversity college graduate?
[00:42:30.542 --> 00:42:39.932]  Because when you see this woman on the stand, you ask yourself, how did she graduate college, how did she pass the bar exam, and how did she become a district attorney?
[00:42:40.332 --> 00:42:41.554]  She's not very bright.
[00:42:43.464 --> 00:42:44.564]  Diversity hires.
[00:42:45.625 --> 00:42:46.665]  Diversity hires.
[00:42:47.346 --> 00:42:48.866]  We're going to come back and play all these clips.
[00:42:48.966 --> 00:42:51.207]  This stuff is just crazy.
[00:42:51.307 --> 00:42:52.668]  And these are the people that want to conquer you.
[00:42:52.808 --> 00:42:54.308]  These are the people that want to destroy the country.
[00:42:54.569 --> 00:42:55.989]  They don't even know where Belize is on a map.
[00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:01.271]  But folks, we're standing up for our rights.
[00:43:01.311 --> 00:43:02.392]  We're standing up for your rights.
[00:43:02.412 --> 00:43:04.793]  We're standing up for all of our freedoms and our children.
[00:43:04.993 --> 00:43:10.235]  If you don't spread the word about the broadcast, if you don't share the links, if you don't buy products at InfoWarsHore.com, then...
[00:43:11.687 --> 00:43:12.648]  I'm not griping at you.
[00:43:12.668 --> 00:43:13.768]  I'm just saying, what are you doing?
[00:43:14.869 --> 00:43:18.190]  Less than 1% of you ever buy a product at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:43:19.051 --> 00:43:26.955]  If just a half a percent more would go buy a book or a film or a t-shirt or get some of our great supplements and then reorder them because they really work, just try it.
[00:43:27.575 --> 00:43:29.516]  We would be able to do so many things.
[00:43:29.876 --> 00:43:33.658]  I'm praying to God that he'll touch your heart to decide to support us.
[00:43:34.179 --> 00:43:35.919]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:43:38.097 --> 00:43:38.718]  It's been sold out.
[00:43:38.778 --> 00:43:39.559]  It's back in stock.
[00:43:39.619 --> 00:43:40.800]  Reformulated even stronger.
[00:43:41.601 --> 00:43:43.483]  Nitric boost to clean out your blood and your whole body.
[00:43:43.924 --> 00:43:45.025]  Vasodilation.
[00:43:45.665 --> 00:43:47.407]  It's got a lot of wonderful side effects.
[00:43:47.427 --> 00:43:48.068]  And I mean good ones.
[00:43:48.088 --> 00:43:49.269]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:50.811]  It is powerful.
[00:43:50.851 --> 00:43:51.772]  So be careful with it.
[00:43:52.113 --> 00:43:53.274]  Next level foundational energy.

[00:44:00.461 --> 00:44:12.285]  We are in the middle of a crude and ugly communist revolution funded by the big banks as a battering ram into a new age digital economy and a total surveillance state.
[00:44:12.725 --> 00:44:20.748]  All branches of government are attacking we the people and they offer us only one option a meaningless vote in a rigged election.
[00:44:21.628 --> 00:44:23.489]  What we can do is be prepared.
[00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:32.334]  And you can support the InfoWar by shopping at InfoWarStore.com for products to help you through good times and bad.

[00:44:44.341 --> 00:44:47.946]  Share them, upload them, and send them everywhere.
[00:44:48.627 --> 00:44:52.252]  Let the world unite for truth, justice, and 1776 worldwide.
[00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:03.122]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[00:45:03.442 --> 00:45:06.604]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[00:45:07.004 --> 00:45:11.487]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[00:45:12.108 --> 00:45:14.229]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[00:45:14.549 --> 00:45:22.534]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's You Will Eat the Bugs.
[00:45:23.154 --> 00:45:24.475]  This is The Great Awakening.
[00:45:24.995 --> 00:45:28.879]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[00:45:29.359 --> 00:45:32.883]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[00:45:33.163 --> 00:45:35.686]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.

[00:45:59.522 --> 00:46:02.064]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalist.
[00:46:02.444 --> 00:46:04.785]  And people can't identify who's a patriot and who isn't.
[00:46:05.105 --> 00:46:08.267]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalist.
[00:46:08.307 --> 00:46:11.229]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.
[00:46:11.469 --> 00:46:22.056]  That's why I designed this amazing 1776 red, white, and blue Gadsden flag shirt so you can support the Infowar and meet like-minded people everywhere when you wear it.
[00:46:22.176 --> 00:46:22.677]  We're good to go.
[00:46:34.212 --> 00:46:35.153]  We're good to go.
[00:46:35.173 --> 00:46:36.053]  We're good to go.
[00:46:36.133 --> 00:46:37.054]  We're good to go.
[00:47:01.795 --> 00:47:07.738]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:17.224 --> 00:47:29.791]  All right, we're going to get to some of these Fannie Willis clips and...
[00:47:30.865 --> 00:47:32.526]  Well, she might be in trouble.
[00:47:32.606 --> 00:47:33.126]  I doubt it.
[00:47:35.448 --> 00:47:37.709]  But Joe Biden is live right now, guys.
[00:47:37.729 --> 00:47:39.330]  Let's just pop this up on the screen.
[00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:42.512]  And I really don't care to hear from Biden right now.
[00:47:43.472 --> 00:47:46.034]  But maybe we should just see what he's talking about.
[00:47:46.054 --> 00:47:49.115]  He's addressing the nation on the Mulvaney killing.
[00:47:49.596 --> 00:47:49.916]  Okay?
[00:47:51.417 --> 00:47:56.219]  So again, I don't want to be the dog getting wagged by the tail here.
[00:47:56.299 --> 00:47:56.960]  But it's just like...
[00:47:57.927 --> 00:47:58.227]  I don't know.
[00:48:15.805 --> 00:48:27.447]  But it's just like, we don't have press conferences for Gonzalo Lira, who gets killed in a Ukrainian prison, tortured and killed, but we do press conferences within hours of Mulvaney being killed.
[00:48:27.507 --> 00:48:30.088]  Is Biden even still alive, guys, or did he already walk away?
[00:48:33.088 --> 00:48:34.889]  So he spoke for like, what, maybe five minutes?
[00:48:36.089 --> 00:48:37.209]  So, okay.
[00:48:37.709 --> 00:48:45.371]  So Biden walks up to the podium for five minutes, tells you how bad Putin is, and then he killed Mulvaney with no proof, and then goes back to nappy time.
[00:48:46.667 --> 00:48:48.487]  So we were going to carry it, but he's already done speaking.
[00:48:48.687 --> 00:48:49.708]  So that's what you get from Biden.
[00:48:50.788 --> 00:48:52.268]  So it's all too perfect.
[00:48:53.168 --> 00:48:53.768]  It's all too perfect.
[00:48:53.788 --> 00:48:54.969]  They murder Ashley Babbitt.
[00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:57.649]  Boyland.
[00:48:57.889 --> 00:49:00.270]  I mean, it was like four Trump supporters died on January 6th.
[00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:01.090]  They don't say a damn thing.
[00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:01.750]  They celebrate it.
[00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:04.711]  They celebrate the police officer that shot an unarmed veteran, a woman.
[00:49:06.851 --> 00:49:09.952]  Five January 6th political prisoners have committed suicide.
[00:49:09.972 --> 00:49:10.872]  They don't say a damn thing.
[00:49:13.752 --> 00:49:17.174]  Gonzalo Lira gets tortured and murdered by the Ukraine regime.
[00:49:17.194 --> 00:49:18.135]  They don't say a damn thing.
[00:49:18.175 --> 00:49:18.976]  No press conferences.
[00:49:19.016 --> 00:49:19.316]  Nothing.
[00:49:20.577 --> 00:49:27.442]  And now they've got the whole propaganda machine rolling out ready to blame Putin for killing Novani the day after Russian space nukes.
[00:49:27.842 --> 00:49:28.442]  There's the story.
[00:49:28.502 --> 00:49:29.383]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:49:31.325 --> 00:49:32.045]  I'm not an idiot.
[00:49:33.446 --> 00:49:36.308]  And even if Putin did have Novani killed, I've got bigger problems.
[00:49:36.728 --> 00:49:38.790]  Joe Biden is a bigger problem to me than Putin is.
[00:49:42.403 --> 00:49:46.284]  The entire Biden administration is a bigger problem to me than Putin is and ever could be.
[00:49:47.644 --> 00:49:49.865]  And see, that's the real deception.
[00:49:51.845 --> 00:49:52.846]  That's the real deception.
[00:49:53.146 --> 00:49:54.586]  Putin could be the worst guy on the planet.
[00:49:54.706 --> 00:49:55.907]  He could be the best guy on the planet.
[00:49:56.347 --> 00:49:58.047]  It's all a distraction.
[00:49:58.467 --> 00:50:04.729]  The real criminals, the real enemies of America, the real threat to our future are in Washington, D.C., in Congress.
[00:50:04.749 --> 00:50:06.269]  Their names are Chuck Schumer.
[00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:08.750]  Their names are Mitch McConnell.
[00:50:11.348 --> 00:50:12.589]  Not Vladimir Putin.
[00:50:17.433 --> 00:50:18.193]  It's all a distraction.
[00:50:18.233 --> 00:50:21.876]  The real threat are people like Fannie Willis who have motives.
[00:50:23.197 --> 00:50:24.258]  Anti-white motives.
[00:50:25.299 --> 00:50:26.640]  Anti-conservative motives.
[00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:32.445]  Yes, that's what Fannie Willis brings with her every day she goes to work as a district attorney.
[00:50:32.785 --> 00:50:34.006]  And she's not the only one.
[00:50:34.326 --> 00:50:37.228]  So this is why this Willis story I think is actually important.
[00:50:37.248 --> 00:50:40.391]  Because it shows you the types of people Soros is hiring.
[00:50:41.903 --> 00:50:47.465]  Not just unqualified for the job, but should be disqualified from the job.
[00:50:49.807 --> 00:50:51.767]  I mean, just listen to this embarrassment.
[00:50:51.787 --> 00:50:53.188]  Let's just go down these clips.
[00:50:53.468 --> 00:50:57.750]  Does this sound like a professional woman in clip one?
[00:50:59.011 --> 00:51:01.111]  I'm not talking about that.
[00:51:01.172 --> 00:51:04.053]  I'm talking about outside of that.
[00:51:04.093 --> 00:51:06.354]  Did you ever pay him anything other than cash?
[00:51:07.253 --> 00:51:10.817]  I've only given him cash a few times in the course of what we're talking about.
[00:51:13.419 --> 00:51:17.183]  If we would go to dinner, I wouldn't give him cash because he paid for dinner or I paid for dinner.
[00:51:17.583 --> 00:51:20.606]  I've given him cash only a few times in life, probably four.
[00:51:21.627 --> 00:51:27.092]  Probably the most money I've ever handed him is $2,500, the least amount of money I've handed him, probably between $500 and $1,000.
[00:51:27.132 --> 00:51:28.554]  You never wrote him a check?
[00:51:33.962 --> 00:51:35.663]  Ma'am, I don't have checks.
[00:51:36.864 --> 00:51:37.044]  Okay.
[00:51:37.084 --> 00:51:41.128]  So you have no proof of any reimbursement for any of these things because it was all cash, right?
[00:51:41.588 --> 00:51:44.590]  The testimony of one witness is enough to prove a fact.
[00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:46.672]  So my question was, do you have any proof?
[00:51:46.732 --> 00:51:47.953]  Is that what you're intimating right here?
[00:51:48.713 --> 00:51:50.735]  I'm asking if you have any proof that you paid him any money.
[00:51:50.755 --> 00:51:52.036]  The proof is what I just told you.
[00:51:53.297 --> 00:51:54.158]  You have no written proof.
[00:51:54.178 --> 00:51:56.339]  Is that correct?
[00:51:58.981 --> 00:52:00.442]  So I have some...
[00:52:03.288 --> 00:52:05.549]  Probably some transactions like in Belize.
[00:52:05.569 --> 00:52:09.811]  I probably spent $500 on my card in Belize.
[00:52:10.071 --> 00:52:15.534]  I spent, I can't remember, $900 on each of our tickets to go to Belize.
[00:52:16.835 --> 00:52:19.036]  Now, there's obvious questions here.
[00:52:21.417 --> 00:52:23.478]  Like, why are you paying Nathan Wade in cash?
[00:52:24.078 --> 00:52:27.240]  And she admits that there is no record of these payments.
[00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:27.940]  Well, how convenient.
[00:52:29.005 --> 00:52:29.926]  How convenient.
[00:52:30.066 --> 00:52:31.508]  And look, I'm not going to sit here.
[00:52:32.249 --> 00:52:38.516]  Quite frankly, I don't care about the IRS and you keeping books to please the IRS, but clearly she was not doing that.
[00:52:40.418 --> 00:52:43.401]  And now she's asked to produce records of these payments and she can't do it.
[00:52:43.461 --> 00:52:44.122]  How convenient.
[00:52:45.403 --> 00:52:46.685]  Always paying him in cash.
[00:52:49.707 --> 00:52:53.069]  Now look, again, I support Fannie Willis paying somebody in cash.
[00:52:53.269 --> 00:52:57.371]  This is why cash is important, so that the government can't spy on you in every transaction you make.
[00:52:57.651 --> 00:52:59.072]  But she clearly knew that, huh?
[00:53:01.233 --> 00:53:02.494]  She clearly knew that.
[00:53:05.456 --> 00:53:11.359]  Now, we'll see what else develops from this, because she said a bunch of other things that could be easily disproven if they were lies.
[00:53:15.421 --> 00:53:17.763]  But listen to what she says here in clip 8.
[00:53:18.806 --> 00:53:22.069]  Did she just admit to a campaign finance violation here in Clip 8?
[00:53:23.130 --> 00:53:23.891]  What?
[00:53:23.971 --> 00:53:27.354]  When she took out a bunch of money from her first campaign, she kept the cash?
[00:53:27.394 --> 00:53:30.217]  I mean, there might be an innocent explanation for that.
[00:53:48.809 --> 00:53:49.629]  But then again, J.D.
[00:53:51.490 --> 00:54:00.834]  Vance was paying attention to this, and he said that he believes Fannie Willis admitted to multiple felonies during her testimony yesterday.
[00:54:01.715 --> 00:54:02.615]  Multiple felonies!
[00:54:04.656 --> 00:54:05.677]  But she's a Democrat.
[00:54:05.857 --> 00:54:06.957]  She's a strong black woman.
[00:54:06.997 --> 00:54:07.998]  She's above the law.
[00:54:08.938 --> 00:54:10.599]  She is the law, as she sees it.
[00:54:12.438 --> 00:54:12.938]  We're good to go.
[00:54:42.722 --> 00:54:45.684]  It's like every other two-minute clip I watch of this Fannie Willis interview.
[00:54:45.704 --> 00:54:47.105]  She admits to committing another felony.
[00:54:47.345 --> 00:54:48.126]  Yeah, but she'll get away with it.
[00:54:50.328 --> 00:54:56.392]  Now listen to what she says here in clip nine, which might be easily provable as a lie and perhaps perjury.
[00:54:59.935 --> 00:55:05.679]  My next question is based on her opening the door, and therefore I'll just ask it, and Your Honor can decide whether or not it's appropriate.
[00:55:05.699 --> 00:55:07.780]  When you went to D.C., did you go to the White House?
[00:55:08.381 --> 00:55:09.742]  I did not go to the White House.
[00:55:11.698 --> 00:55:18.603]  Well, now, ladies and gentlemen, this is interesting because there is a White House visitor log and Fannie's name is on it.
[00:55:20.745 --> 00:55:21.505]  Her name is on it.
[00:55:23.707 --> 00:55:25.428]  Now, again, maybe there's an innocent explanation.
[00:55:25.448 --> 00:55:27.229]  There might be another Fannie Willis running around.
[00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:28.690]  Yeah.
[00:55:29.691 --> 00:55:30.011]  Sure.
[00:55:31.673 --> 00:55:32.113]  Sure there is.
[00:55:34.535 --> 00:55:38.738]  But the White House visitor logs might prove otherwise.
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:41.160]  But she was so strong.
[00:55:41.941 --> 00:55:45.222]  Democrats saying she was so strong on that stand.
[00:55:45.262 --> 00:55:48.723]  Liberals saying she was so strong on that stand.
[00:55:48.883 --> 00:55:53.265]  And yet she was so weak that they didn't call her to the stand again today.
[00:55:55.485 --> 00:56:02.068]  She sounds like a very serious person talking about all the cash she was giving to her lover Nathan Wade here in clip 10.
[00:56:04.608 --> 00:56:08.130]  And then he tells me how much it is, and I give him the money back.
[00:56:08.590 --> 00:56:12.452]  I don't, just like you're asking me about the money with Robin, I don't do my friends like that.
[00:56:12.892 --> 00:56:15.773]  So if you tell me it's a G, then you're going to get $1,000.
[00:56:16.053 --> 00:56:18.955]  Whatever it is, I didn't ever make him produce receipts to me.
[00:56:19.015 --> 00:56:21.256]  Whatever he told me it was, I gave him the money back.
[00:56:21.856 --> 00:56:22.537]  It's a G, baby.
[00:56:23.577 --> 00:56:28.099]  Okay, so they basically have to admit they were having an affair, a sexual affair.
[00:56:28.279 --> 00:56:33.322]  But that's funny, because here's what she said in 2020 about not having affairs with employees in clip 12.
[00:56:34.403 --> 00:56:38.666]  Because they deserve a DA that won't have sex with his employees.
[00:56:39.086 --> 00:56:45.831]  Because they deserve a DA that won't put money in their own pocket when it should go to benefit children.
[00:56:46.111 --> 00:56:47.252]  Because we deserve better.
[00:56:47.993 --> 00:56:49.594]  She did exactly both of those things.
[00:56:50.574 --> 00:56:52.336]  And so it looks like they were...
[00:56:53.561 --> 00:56:54.442]  We're good to go.
[00:57:18.161 --> 00:57:21.223]  I'm not going to emasculate a black man, but I'm just telling you.
[00:57:21.243 --> 00:57:21.903]  I'm sorry, what?
[00:57:22.143 --> 00:57:25.565]  I'm not going to emasculate a black man.
[00:57:25.585 --> 00:57:26.766]  Did you understand that?
[00:57:27.926 --> 00:57:29.827]  I think I understood that.
[00:57:30.048 --> 00:57:32.549]  I think what you meant is you're not going to emasculate a black man.
[00:57:32.769 --> 00:57:35.270]  So that would mean you would emasculate a white man.
[00:57:37.271 --> 00:57:38.392]  I mean, that's all I can take from that.
[00:57:38.432 --> 00:57:42.794]  So I wonder, do you think Fannie Willis' execution of the law might favor black men?
[00:57:42.814 --> 00:57:46.476]  Hmm, maybe that's why crime is so bad in Atlanta.
[00:57:46.496 --> 00:57:47.057]  I don't know.
[00:57:47.237 --> 00:57:47.437]  Maybe.
[00:57:49.209 --> 00:57:50.110]  Hello, Americans.
[00:57:50.890 --> 00:57:52.552]  I want to share with you a story.
[00:57:53.152 --> 00:57:59.397]  A story about inflammation, the silent menace that lurks within our bodies, affecting our health and well-being.
[00:58:00.478 --> 00:58:06.283]  Inflammation, the root cause of countless ailments, quietly wreaking havoc over time.
[00:58:07.344 --> 00:58:14.990]  Long-term exposure to inflammation has been linked to a myriad of health issues, from heart disease to arthritis, even cognitive decline.
[00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:23.664]  But fear not, for there's a beacon of hope found in the wisdom of nature, a remedy that has stood the test of time, turmeric.
[00:58:24.405 --> 00:58:29.213]  And now I present to you bodies from InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:59:35.294 --> 00:59:41.920]  Several studies have shown it helps to reduce cortisol, increase serotonin, and boost vitality.

[00:59:52.884 --> 00:59:58.626]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:01.887 --> 01:00:04.828]  Did you go to a cabin with Miss Willis ever?
[01:00:06.989 --> 01:00:07.169]  Ever.
[01:00:07.709 --> 01:00:07.869]  Ever.
[01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:20.071]  No.
[01:00:31.142 --> 01:00:31.342]  No.
[01:00:31.942 --> 01:00:44.047]  We're now into day two of the hearing where a judge is determining whether Fannie Willis has to step down from a political prosecution of President Trump there in Atlanta, Georgia.
[01:00:44.087 --> 01:00:45.268]  This is a complete meltdown.
[01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:48.089]  We've got clips for meltdowns coming up here in a moment.
[01:00:48.589 --> 01:00:49.810]  But that was on day one.
[01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:52.431]  Right now we are in day two.
[01:00:53.371 --> 01:01:05.938]  And a gentleman named Terrence Bradley that worked with Fannie Willis' boyfriend, Nathan Wade, had signed an affidavit that indeed they did have a relationship, Fannie Willis and Nathan Wade.
[01:01:06.478 --> 01:01:18.685]  Now he said the lawyers threaten him and claims that he'll be disbarred and lose his law license if he doesn't claim all activity that he's ever had in the last, what, four, five, six, seven years.
[01:01:19.645 --> 01:01:32.772]  With Mr. Nathan Wade is now attorney-client privilege, and so he can't comment on the affidavit where he's saying, indeed, they did have a relationship, which they've now been trying to deny.
[01:01:33.273 --> 01:01:35.714]  As you know, Mr. Wade is a southern gentleman.
[01:01:36.294 --> 01:01:37.075]  To me, not so much.
[01:01:37.631 --> 01:01:41.613]  She should have stepped down a month ago, but she's so arrogant she's not.
[01:01:42.133 --> 01:01:43.654]  So the quicksand's getting deeper.
[01:01:44.214 --> 01:02:04.004]  And if you investigate the New York real estate judge, or you investigate the federal judges, especially in D.C., if you investigate Leticia James, or if you investigate any of these people, it is all a revolving door of special interest and kickbacks and jobs and money they're being given.
[01:02:04.624 --> 01:02:05.845]  Everything they're saying...
[01:02:07.028 --> 01:02:07.448]  I was advised...
[01:02:35.061 --> 01:02:44.627]  By the bar, that Rule 1.6 of confidentiality applies and that I cannot reveal anything that I saw or learned.
[01:02:45.448 --> 01:02:53.533]  And that if the court is asking me to do that, that an immediate certificate of review should be asked.
[01:02:54.767 --> 01:03:00.509]  I was sitting there with my attorneys, and this was what was told to us.
[01:03:00.809 --> 01:03:02.970]  To state that Rule 1.6 applies.
[01:03:03.350 --> 01:03:10.573]  So basically what we've got is we've got Mr. Wade being able to say what he wants about this relationship, but then we're not allowed to ask questions to qualify that.
[01:03:11.634 --> 01:03:13.234]  So that's not how it works.
[01:03:13.274 --> 01:03:16.476]  They either get to admit it, or they don't.
[01:03:17.236 --> 01:03:19.557]  Your Honor, but he's already presented that he has no knowledge about this.
[01:03:20.337 --> 01:03:22.041]  I think he's taking the position that
[01:03:30.339 --> 01:03:34.122]  He's not willing to share anything Mr. Wade ever told him.
[01:03:34.462 --> 01:03:39.906]  Your office objected to us getting Delta records for flights that you may have taken with Mr. Wade.
[01:03:40.206 --> 01:03:40.866]  Well, no, no, no.
[01:03:42.107 --> 01:03:43.488]  I object to you getting records.
[01:03:43.508 --> 01:03:46.310]  You've been intrusive into people's personal lives.
[01:03:46.330 --> 01:03:47.111]  You're confused.
[01:03:47.131 --> 01:03:48.251]  You think I'm on trial.
[01:03:48.592 --> 01:03:51.614]  These people are on trial for trying to steal an election in 2020.
[01:03:51.794 --> 01:03:54.656]  I'm not on trial, no matter how hard you try to put me on trial.
[01:03:55.456 --> 01:03:56.637]  I'm not a hostile witness.
[01:03:56.657 --> 01:03:57.858]  I very much want to be.
[01:03:57.878 --> 01:04:00.779]  Not so much that your hostleness wills to be an adverse witness.
[01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:02.140]  Your interests are opposed to Ms.
[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:02.541]  Merchant's.
[01:04:03.721 --> 01:04:03.841]  Ms.
[01:04:03.881 --> 01:04:09.265]  Merchant's interests are contrary to democracy, Your Honor, not to mine.
[01:04:10.188 --> 01:04:12.469]  Has he ever visited you at the place you laid your head?
[01:04:12.669 --> 01:04:14.429]  So let's be clear, because you've lied in this.
[01:04:14.549 --> 01:04:15.870]  Let me tell you which one you lied in.
[01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:16.250]  Right here?
[01:04:16.850 --> 01:04:18.091]  I think you lied right here.
[01:04:18.131 --> 01:04:19.191]  No, no, no, no.
[01:04:19.331 --> 01:04:20.251]  This is the truth, Judge.
[01:04:20.331 --> 01:04:22.252]  It is a lie.
[01:04:22.392 --> 01:04:23.152]  It is a lie.
[01:04:23.432 --> 01:04:23.573]  Ms.
[01:04:23.613 --> 01:04:24.513]  Willis?
[01:04:24.553 --> 01:04:25.413]  Mr. Sano, thank you.
[01:04:25.433 --> 01:04:26.293]  We're going to take five minutes.
[01:04:27.254 --> 01:04:27.934]  Be back in five.
[01:04:35.657 --> 01:04:39.418]  And there's the judge breaking because Fannie Willis was having complete meltdowns.
[01:04:41.109 --> 01:04:44.570]  I mean, it's just... It's not just corruption.
[01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:45.650]  It's incompetence.
[01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:47.790]  It's embarrassing.
[01:04:48.070 --> 01:04:49.771]  It's shameful.
[01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:52.211]  This is what happens when you end meritocracy.
[01:04:52.791 --> 01:04:56.152]  Alex Jones and Lou Dobbs, coming up next.
[01:04:59.593 --> 01:05:00.513]  Hello, Americans.
[01:05:01.313 --> 01:05:02.893]  I want to share with you a story.
[01:05:03.574 --> 01:05:09.795]  A story about inflammation, the silent menace that lurks within our bodies, affecting our health and well-being.
[01:05:10.879 --> 01:05:16.722]  Inflammation, the root cause of countless ailments, quietly wreaking havoc over time.
[01:05:17.743 --> 01:05:25.467]  Long-term exposure to inflammation has been linked to a myriad of health issues, from heart disease to arthritis, even cognitive decline.
[01:05:26.447 --> 01:05:34.051]  But fear not, for there's a beacon of hope found in the wisdom of nature, a remedy that has stood the test of time, turmeric.
[01:05:34.831 --> 01:05:39.634]  And now I present to you Baudis from InfoWarsStore.com,
[01:05:40.445 --> 01:05:48.107]  A powerful blend crafted with precision-boasting 95% curcuminoids extracted from turmeric.
[01:05:48.267 --> 01:05:50.208]  It's good for your heart, your brain, everything.
[01:05:50.348 --> 01:05:52.048]  It is 40% off.
[01:05:52.168 --> 01:05:53.188]  Back in stock.
[01:05:53.288 --> 01:05:55.349]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[01:05:55.869 --> 01:05:57.910]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:06:08.361 --> 01:06:14.623]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:15.103 --> 01:06:21.585]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:06:21.605 --> 01:06:25.326]  We're about to be hearing from Alex Jones and Lou Dobbs.
[01:06:27.106 --> 01:06:31.867]  That's going to carry us through most of this second hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:34.408 --> 01:06:36.489]  Brought to you by InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:06:39.113 --> 01:06:53.476]  But you look at this Fannie Willis thing, and it's not even that I care about Fannie Willis having romantic affairs, even if they're married or what, with Nathan Wade.
[01:06:54.036 --> 01:06:59.978]  It's not that I really care about Fannie Willis making under-the-table payments with cash because she doesn't want them on record.
[01:07:00.898 --> 01:07:01.878]  Honestly, couldn't care less.
[01:07:02.981 --> 01:07:06.122]  But it's part of the larger picture of corruption.
[01:07:06.182 --> 01:07:14.746]  It's part of the larger picture of these are the types of people that are being put in positions of power that have no respect for the law themselves.
[01:07:16.847 --> 01:07:19.208]  And they don't even have basic ethics.
[01:07:20.909 --> 01:07:23.671]  Again, her having affairs, couldn't care less.
[01:07:24.191 --> 01:07:26.452]  Her making payments under the table, couldn't care less.
[01:07:28.203 --> 01:07:29.984]  But it's the unethical behavior.
[01:07:30.064 --> 01:07:32.485]  It's the I'm above the law, I am the law behavior.
[01:07:33.025 --> 01:07:34.606]  And then obviously the racism too.
[01:07:36.747 --> 01:07:38.508]  Obviously Fannie Willis is a racist.
[01:07:38.628 --> 01:07:40.068]  She's obviously an anti-white racist.
[01:07:40.308 --> 01:07:41.989]  Again, I don't even care if she's an anti-white racist.
[01:07:42.389 --> 01:07:52.274]  It's that she now has a position of power, a woman who doesn't belong there with no ethics, a racist, and potentially even a felonious criminal.
[01:07:53.454 --> 01:07:54.515]  But she'll be above the law.
[01:07:57.444 --> 01:07:57.884]  Oh, yes.
[01:08:00.065 --> 01:08:06.647]  I would not expect anything to happen to Fannie Willis other than the national embarrassment and the shame that she's brought on herself.
[01:08:07.507 --> 01:08:08.927]  Can't even put a dress on straight.
[01:08:09.727 --> 01:08:10.848]  Where's a dress backwards?
[01:08:10.888 --> 01:08:11.488]  What the hell is that?
[01:08:11.508 --> 01:08:18.470]  Did her and Nathan have a little beforehand and she just had to, you know, hurry up into her dress, puts it on backwards?
[01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:19.470]  What's that about?
[01:08:22.651 --> 01:08:26.712]  Or who knows, given her history, maybe some of the other lawyers had a little Fannie time.
[01:08:29.909 --> 01:08:31.730]  But it's embarrassing for our country.
[01:08:31.930 --> 01:08:41.637]  And when you have unethical, potentially even criminal, racist people running the justice system, this is why everything collapses.
[01:08:41.717 --> 01:08:43.558]  This is why America looks the way it looks.
[01:08:43.598 --> 01:08:46.040]  This is why cities like Atlanta are so violent.
[01:08:49.923 --> 01:08:51.404]  Because of people like Fannie Willis.
[01:08:53.245 --> 01:08:58.909]  And when you end the meritocracy, and when you replace it with diversity...
[01:09:01.778 --> 01:09:02.498]  This is what you get.
[01:09:04.639 --> 01:09:05.339]  This is what you get.
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:09.560]  I mean, folks, it's so bad.
[01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:13.841]  Even CNN is saying that this charade needs to end.
[01:09:14.742 --> 01:09:19.423]  With headlines like, Fannie Willis and Nathan Wade need to step aside to save the country.
[01:09:19.463 --> 01:09:21.103]  I mean, that's how bad this is.
[01:09:21.503 --> 01:09:22.584]  But again, it's the same liberals.
[01:09:22.884 --> 01:09:24.564]  Oh, Fannie was fantastic!
[01:09:24.924 --> 01:09:25.665]  Oh my gosh!
[01:09:25.785 --> 01:09:27.025]  Oh, she's so courageous!
[01:09:27.045 --> 01:09:27.985]  She's so brave!
[01:09:28.445 --> 01:09:30.726]  Oh, I'm just in love with her!
[01:09:32.967 --> 01:09:40.009]  And they create these heroes out of liars and crooks and criminals because they know it's the propaganda they're being fed.
[01:09:40.290 --> 01:09:42.810]  And if they don't amplify it and if they don't believe it, then nobody will.
[01:09:44.311 --> 01:09:47.692]  Oh, but Fannie was so great that they said, Fannie, do not go back on the stand.
[01:09:47.852 --> 01:09:48.853]  Please, for the love of God.
[01:09:50.613 --> 01:09:54.414]  Even CNN is like, you're embarrassing us and you're destroying our case against Trump.
[01:09:56.115 --> 01:09:56.375]  All right.
[01:09:56.575 --> 01:09:58.656]  Now, as I said, Alex Jones and Lou Dobbs coming up.
[01:10:00.882 --> 01:10:01.482]  We're good to go.
[01:10:26.793 --> 01:10:30.976]  And I realize that I'm almost out of vitamin mineral fusion.
[01:10:31.736 --> 01:10:33.958]  So I need to go and fill my shopping cart.
[01:10:33.998 --> 01:10:35.559]  I need to get some vitamin mineral fusion.
[01:10:35.859 --> 01:10:41.182]  Over 100% daily value of vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin C, vitamin D, and so much more.
[01:10:41.222 --> 01:10:42.203]  That's why I start every day with it.
[01:10:42.603 --> 01:10:44.505]  But then I need some Turbo Force Plus too.
[01:10:45.563 --> 01:10:47.645]  I'm all out of Turbo Force Plus as well.
[01:10:48.086 --> 01:10:50.849]  I need to get some Brain Force Plus so that I can have energy and focus.
[01:10:51.130 --> 01:10:55.955]  10 hours of clean energy in one scoop of Turbo Force Plus from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:10:56.175 --> 01:10:57.116]  These are great products.
[01:10:57.677 --> 01:10:59.780]  I'm a product of the product of InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:04.185]  Things you need, things you want, help you keep your immune system strong and everything else.
[01:11:05.956 --> 01:11:10.941]  So, I can tell you from experience from using these products that they're great.
[01:11:11.462 --> 01:11:20.451]  So you get a great product and you support the InfoWar, which you know the deep state, the Democrats, all the corrupt entities that want to destroy this country want us all fair.
[01:11:20.471 --> 01:11:25.217]  But war is still here and now we got Alex Jones and Lou Dobbs.
[01:11:26.277 --> 01:11:31.061]  And now, Alex Jones, THE Alex Jones, I might add.
[01:11:31.882 --> 01:11:33.183]  Alex, it is great to see you.
[01:11:33.203 --> 01:11:40.790]  It's been a long while in coming, but we're delighted to have you here and to have a chance to have a little talk.
[01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:43.892]  Your thoughts today on America.
[01:11:45.677 --> 01:11:51.080]  Well, I'm glad you raised that up front because you sent me a few questions, but you didn't add that one in.
[01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:52.061]  That's what I was going to say.
[01:11:52.661 --> 01:11:56.924]  What is it like when you add the top show in the English-speaking world?
[01:11:57.424 --> 01:12:01.987]  We're not trying to be first place here, but a bigger show than Tucker had on Fox.
[01:12:02.647 --> 01:12:06.850]  When you were on CNN reaching 10 million people a day conservatively,
[01:12:08.186 --> 01:12:13.989]  Predicting 20 years ago, 18 years ago, everything that's happened.
[01:12:14.009 --> 01:12:17.651]  So our job is much easier as patriots that are anti-globalists.
[01:12:18.131 --> 01:12:22.073]  I mean, you pioneered on mainstream media, the first person to ever break all this.
[01:12:22.473 --> 01:12:33.139]  So I was going to ask you, and you asked me questions, what is it like now to now be here when Elon Musk and Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson all sound just like you did 20-something years ago?
[01:12:34.141 --> 01:12:40.888]  Well, it sounds like music to me, because I didn't hear any like voices, like minds.
[01:12:41.328 --> 01:12:42.990]  Well, I will reserve that.
[01:12:43.250 --> 01:12:46.253]  You were amazing throughout your career.
[01:12:46.313 --> 01:12:54.461]  You started as a skeptic of all that is establishment, and my hand's off to you.
[01:12:54.501 --> 01:12:55.882]  But I was out in the wilderness.
[01:12:55.962 --> 01:12:57.103]  I mean, I was out in the wilderness.
[01:12:57.163 --> 01:12:57.484]  I was a...
[01:12:58.044 --> 01:13:03.126]  Bush Liger, when I was doing it, you charged right on, and it showed that freedom is popular.
[01:13:03.587 --> 01:13:11.450]  You have the number one show, as I said, covering freedom, just like all the top shows now are populist, anti-globalist.
[01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:14.832]  So I think that's a very positive thing about the awakening that we've reached.
[01:13:15.612 --> 01:13:17.354]  I've been a populist all along.
[01:13:17.394 --> 01:13:22.039]  I've always said, you know, populist, they say it like it's a dirty word.
[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:23.862]  In my view, it means people.
[01:13:24.342 --> 01:13:28.267]  And if you're not for the people of this country, who the hell are you for?
[01:13:28.807 --> 01:13:33.513]  So if you don't call yourself a populist, I want you to say exactly what you are, what you do.
[01:13:34.113 --> 01:13:34.754]  We're good to go.
[01:13:52.706 --> 01:13:56.007]  Well, I guess I land a few, but it's harder to take them, I'll put it that way.
[01:13:56.067 --> 01:13:56.747]  I want to talk about...
[01:14:14.113 --> 01:14:14.973]  Go ahead, Alex.
[01:14:15.094 --> 01:14:15.334]  Go ahead.
[01:14:15.534 --> 01:14:29.318]  No, I just know that I'm coming on with you, but I want to talk about you because when I look at who in the last 30, 40 years has had the biggest effect against this anti-American agenda, it's Ron Paul, it's Lou Dobbs, and then kind of we all came later.
[01:14:29.338 --> 01:14:30.278]  And I'm going to take it away from Tucker.
[01:14:30.318 --> 01:14:31.959]  I'm friends with Tucker, love Tucker.
[01:14:31.999 --> 01:14:32.579]  He's amazing.
[01:14:33.159 --> 01:14:35.120]  Hopefully he'll have me on his show soon.
[01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:35.600]  He should.
[01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:39.241]  But I just look back to the people that...
[01:14:39.241 --> 01:14:39.441]  I think?
[01:15:02.962 --> 01:15:04.623]  I don't care about Hollywood people.
[01:15:04.643 --> 01:15:05.845]  I don't care about sports people.
[01:15:05.885 --> 01:15:06.245]  None of that.
[01:15:06.645 --> 01:15:20.659]  But I do get a little bit giddy talking to you because I'm smart enough to look back and say, if there wasn't Lou Dobbs for all those years on air, the only person in mainstream media saying it, we would be in a lot of trouble today.
[01:15:20.679 --> 01:15:21.640]  And we're still in a lot of trouble.
[01:15:21.941 --> 01:15:24.163]  We're in a lot better position thanks to you.
[01:15:24.243 --> 01:15:25.424]  So I know it's a little bit...
[01:15:26.345 --> 01:15:28.447]  A little bit of me groveling here, but I'm not.
[01:15:28.847 --> 01:15:33.530]  We need to recognize the people that were, you know, trailblazers, and you're a maverick, brother.
[01:15:34.651 --> 01:15:36.392]  Thank you, and I take that as high praise.
[01:15:36.472 --> 01:15:41.856]  And coming from you, you know, you were talking about being out in the bush.
[01:15:42.556 --> 01:15:51.603]  You were only in the bush because people were scared to death of you in that establishment, and they were putting you back as far as they could, as long as they could, and you broke through and everything.
[01:15:52.383 --> 01:15:53.284]  Hallelujah, brother.
[01:15:53.304 --> 01:16:08.929]  And it's like you say, it's a great gathering, these voices now, to hear them taking up the issues that matter instead of the pablum of the mainstream national corporate legacy, whatever you want to call it, Marxist media.
[01:16:10.050 --> 01:16:14.131]  People are wising up to it in a hurry, and it's wonderful to see.
[01:16:14.151 --> 01:16:15.752]  And the question only now is,
[01:16:16.932 --> 01:16:18.314]  Is it soon enough?
[01:16:18.854 --> 01:16:21.097]  Because we're sitting here ten months away from an election.
[01:16:22.298 --> 01:16:23.219]  I truly believe it.
[01:16:23.719 --> 01:16:26.062]  A lot of people say it's existential, it's all of this.
[01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:28.985]  I think it's our last best chance, period.
[01:16:29.205 --> 01:16:31.387]  And we've got to move ahead.
[01:16:32.388 --> 01:16:39.576]  I want to ask you, back in those days, if you could ever have imagined in your earliest days that this country would
[01:16:39.776 --> 01:16:45.117]  Would have a 2,000 mile long border that they turned over to the Mexican drug cartels.
[01:16:45.137 --> 01:16:46.098]  There's no middle man.
[01:16:46.538 --> 01:16:48.938]  Biden just handed it over to the cartels.
[01:16:49.418 --> 01:16:51.539]  And the Border Patrol is afraid to get near it.
[01:16:52.099 --> 01:16:55.820]  The National Guard has to on their side edge up to it.
[01:16:56.420 --> 01:17:03.122]  But no one is dealing with the reality that is the cartels controlling Mexico and our border.
[01:17:04.581 --> 01:17:06.022]  It's total rogue warrior.
[01:17:06.042 --> 01:17:15.727]  You know, back 20-something years ago when you were exposing it in the last decade on Fox Business and all that, it was a problem, but not because I've been down there 50 times or more like you have.
[01:17:16.267 --> 01:17:18.688]  Now it is road warrior bizarre.
[01:17:19.229 --> 01:17:22.870]  You don't have to go looking for smugglers or kids being loaded in vans without their parents.
[01:17:23.411 --> 01:17:27.013]  You go there for even 30 minutes and you are just – I know I am –
[01:17:28.033 --> 01:17:28.394]  I think?
[01:17:47.416 --> 01:17:53.897]  Irritation has been turned into a facilitator of the crime, and it just shows the social contract's broken.
[01:17:54.437 --> 01:17:57.818]  We know the NGOs that you exposed on Fox Business that got you in so much trouble.
[01:17:58.118 --> 01:17:59.018]  It's finally in the news.
[01:17:59.578 --> 01:18:03.439]  Are paying these Democrats we see on the news to house these illegals.
[01:18:03.459 --> 01:18:04.899]  They're not doing it out of the goodness of their heart.
[01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:11.821]  It's a new business for Democrat voters to bring in new Democrat voters, but also house them for 40, 50 years.
[01:18:12.961 --> 01:18:13.221]  I think?
[01:18:30.686 --> 01:18:31.647]  We're good to go.
[01:18:58.581 --> 01:19:02.623]  Yeah, it is amazing, and we're talking with the amazing Alex Jones.
[01:19:02.663 --> 01:19:04.683]  We're going to take just a quick break.
[01:19:04.703 --> 01:19:05.644]  We're going to be right back.
[01:19:06.284 --> 01:19:10.005]  We're talking with Alex Jones about the things that matter and matters most.
[01:19:10.545 --> 01:19:13.387]  Of course, this country, the United States of America.
[01:19:13.447 --> 01:19:16.308]  You don't hear people say United States of America a lot, do you?
[01:19:16.808 --> 01:19:19.489]  You don't even hear them talk about the United States anymore.
[01:19:19.689 --> 01:19:23.310]  They'll sort of whisper America, but they won't.
[01:19:24.071 --> 01:19:25.891]  That was my Biden impression, by the way, Alex.
[01:19:26.391 --> 01:19:27.772]  We'll be right back with...
[01:19:28.382 --> 01:19:29.608]  The great Alex Jones.
[01:19:31.451 --> 01:19:31.911]  The year is 2030.
[01:19:32.071 --> 01:19:39.012]  The World Economic Forum's agenda unfolds, ushering in an era where AI seeks to dominate.
[01:19:39.132 --> 01:19:42.733]  In this world of steel and algorithms, there's a ray of hope for humanity.
[01:19:42.973 --> 01:19:45.613]  It's bodies from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:19:45.733 --> 01:19:50.674]  This revolutionary blend of ancient herbs and modern science stands as a symbol of resistance.
[01:19:50.914 --> 01:19:52.715]  It's not just about combating inflammation.
[01:19:52.975 --> 01:19:55.855]  It's about making your body feel invincible in the InfoWar.
[01:19:55.975 --> 01:20:00.016]  Visit InfoWarsStore.com and order yours before the sale is terminated.
[01:20:02.022 --> 01:20:14.992]  We're back with Alex Jones, and Alex, I just want to turn to a reality that is the national capital, the nation's capital, the swamp, the open sewer, whatever people want to describe it.
[01:20:15.553 --> 01:20:21.678]  The truth is it's a land of coercion and blackmail and absolute raw political force.
[01:20:22.398 --> 01:20:30.745]  An NSA whistleblower who's a guest on this show a great deal, a friend, said point blank to me the first time I talked to him,
[01:20:31.641 --> 01:20:39.646]  That he knew there was a problem when the NSA was spying on Barack Obama in 2004.
[01:20:40.707 --> 01:20:48.372]  He knew there was a problem when Supreme Court justices were being surveilled by the NSA.
[01:20:49.612 --> 01:20:53.315]  And he became a whistleblower, and to his great cost and to his great credit.
[01:20:53.715 --> 01:20:54.656]  He's a great patriot.
[01:20:55.916 --> 01:20:59.057]  We, right now, are facing total surveillance.
[01:20:59.298 --> 01:21:05.040]  We are facing a total loss of constitutional rights because the American people are taking it.
[01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:08.201]  How much more can we take, Alex?
[01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:10.300]  So you're right.
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:11.780]  I mean, look at Tucker three years ago.
[01:21:12.401 --> 01:21:15.561]  He gets a call from the NSA, and you're being spied on.
[01:21:16.401 --> 01:21:17.282]  He talks about it.
[01:21:17.362 --> 01:21:18.062]  They don't deny it.
[01:21:18.122 --> 01:21:23.803]  A month later, the Washington Post goes, yeah, we've got your private messages, and we've got transcripts of your phone calls.
[01:21:24.183 --> 01:21:27.024]  That is a huge felony against a journalist.
[01:21:27.564 --> 01:21:30.825]  And Nixon was removed from office for far less.
[01:21:31.605 --> 01:21:35.546]  And so there's this emboldened arrogance to all of it.
[01:21:36.026 --> 01:21:36.106]  And...
[01:21:36.986 --> 01:21:37.686]  We're good to go.
[01:21:37.746 --> 01:21:37.966]  I think?
[01:21:59.992 --> 01:22:03.873]  Trying to find something, and they didn't find anything.
[01:22:03.913 --> 01:22:09.074]  When he was candidate, president-elect, or president, they had the two fake impeachments and the Russiagate.
[01:22:09.094 --> 01:22:15.695]  I remember watching congressional hearings six years ago, and they're just flat out, Alex Jones is a Russian agent.
[01:22:15.995 --> 01:22:19.896]  Never been to Russia, not involved with Russia, know nothing about Russia when it comes to being there.
[01:22:20.276 --> 01:22:27.358]  But they're just saying, I'm a Russian agent, all of Trump's supporters are Russian agents, because they're the globalists that are selling out the country.
[01:22:27.998 --> 01:22:32.279]  And so they need to project onto us that we're the unfaithful ones.
[01:22:32.779 --> 01:22:40.401]  And so, yeah, the general public knows it's not true, but they use that designation to spy on us and it's totally illegal.
[01:22:41.021 --> 01:22:44.642]  And so, yeah, we're kind of already inside the tyranny.
[01:22:44.982 --> 01:22:48.303]  The question is, how high are they going to turn it up?
[01:22:49.465 --> 01:22:50.225]  You're right.
[01:22:50.485 --> 01:22:53.907]  And just where do they stop if they stop at all?
[01:22:54.487 --> 01:23:06.991]  We are right now, and the national mainstream media will not acknowledge that these Marxists who control the Democrat Party, the Marxist Dems who are the masters of this puppet President Biden,
[01:23:07.828 --> 01:23:08.869]  We're good to go.
[01:23:08.889 --> 01:23:09.410]  I think?
[01:23:23.466 --> 01:23:29.552]  And meanwhile, we have a fight over the Republican National Committee.
[01:23:30.133 --> 01:23:39.062]  We're having fights over electors and the stuff that's at the margin, when the reality is that government of ours is in the hands of a foreign power.
[01:23:39.542 --> 01:23:40.062]  We're good to go.
[01:24:08.622 --> 01:24:09.062]  We're good to go.
[01:24:09.083 --> 01:24:09.663]  We're good to go.
[01:24:27.401 --> 01:24:29.782]  Well, that's right, Lou, and you always stay on purpose.
[01:24:29.822 --> 01:24:30.803]  I learned so much from you.
[01:24:31.423 --> 01:24:41.589]  We think of Russia or China, and there are certainly adversaries, and China's really out of control and evil and hugely wedded the Democratic Party and people like Mitch McConnell on the Republican side, so it's a huge real threat.
[01:24:42.250 --> 01:24:46.893]  But the globalists, the leftists, the Marxists, they really hate America.
[01:24:46.973 --> 01:24:53.777]  Even when they run it, they still see it because of its Christian background and because it did oppose the Soviet Union and things as the enemy.
[01:24:54.597 --> 01:24:58.780]  And they are the main threat, and they are like a foreign government.
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:00.982]  They are a fifth column.
[01:25:01.682 --> 01:25:04.604]  They really are an alien group to our country.
[01:25:04.684 --> 01:25:10.829]  BlackRock and the big banks and the money and the Hollywood and the whole woke thing is just a corporate...
[01:25:12.148 --> 01:25:16.770]  A cult with all these minions literally working against the country.
[01:25:17.410 --> 01:25:20.751]  And as big a threat as China is, I'd say it's 20% of the threat.
[01:25:21.211 --> 01:25:22.751]  And Russia is 10% of the threat.
[01:25:23.152 --> 01:25:37.676]  But then I'd say 30% of the threat is our own domestic enemies that have opened us up to Islamic invasion and to criminal invasion that have run our dollar down, that are saying they're going to put mentally ill people in charge, flying airplanes.
[01:25:37.816 --> 01:25:39.597]  I mean, they are admittedly
[01:25:40.959 --> 01:25:41.419]  I don't know.
[01:26:06.357 --> 01:26:07.658]  Because there's a big awakening happening.
[01:26:07.698 --> 01:26:10.981]  The average conservative or populist or Christian now knows, wait, we're in trouble.
[01:26:11.401 --> 01:26:18.788]  But I still don't think they knew what you knew 20 years ago or I knew 20 years ago of just how diabolical this is.
[01:26:19.348 --> 01:26:27.956]  And I just don't know if even our best people realize that we're two minutes to midnight and that this is the crisis not just of America but civilization.
[01:26:27.996 --> 01:26:32.620]  Because if the globalists get full control and they can eradicate the idea of American freedom,
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:37.504]  Then all we have is Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates' ideology of scientific tyranny.
[01:26:37.524 --> 01:26:54.538]  And so that's why they're at war with us, because even though it's the source of their power, the freedom we generated, the productivity, still it's existential to them because they want to get rid of any ember of freedom that they believe could reignite later and displace them.
[01:26:56.764 --> 01:26:58.125]  Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[01:26:58.646 --> 01:27:12.278]  And if you look at it in terms of economics, we're looking at a country in which large corporations, the tech industry itself, massive capital valuations, $3 trillion.
[01:27:12.338 --> 01:27:15.841]  If you're in video, you get to go buy...
[01:27:16.622 --> 01:27:17.643]  We're good to go.
[01:27:17.663 --> 01:27:18.304]  I think?
[01:27:34.561 --> 01:27:37.242]  We are the minions.
[01:27:37.642 --> 01:27:43.823]  We are the de minimis fragments floating in space, and they are the all-powerful.
[01:27:44.304 --> 01:27:56.127]  And we have to find some way in which to bring to heel the idea that this Marxist government of ours is going to be responsive to the people, to the consent of the government.
[01:27:56.547 --> 01:28:00.368]  I remember you doing business news whenever it was, 2000 or whatever,
[01:28:01.488 --> 01:28:04.089]  And you were covering the breakup of Microsoft.
[01:28:04.149 --> 01:28:05.569]  And it was a monopoly, and it was corrupt.
[01:28:05.609 --> 01:28:06.169]  It deserved it.
[01:28:06.749 --> 01:28:10.150]  I look at Bill Gates' corruption, not as a business reporter, but as a layperson.
[01:28:10.610 --> 01:28:18.011]  It's nothing compared to the three big elephants that you just mentioned, Apple and Facebook and Amazon and Google.
[01:28:18.031 --> 01:28:18.991]  Those are four elephants.
[01:28:19.451 --> 01:28:22.432]  And Microsoft now is back.
[01:28:22.852 --> 01:28:24.592]  I mean, isn't the answer trust-busting?
[01:28:24.633 --> 01:28:26.753]  But there's no energy for that now.
[01:28:27.569 --> 01:28:39.578]  There's no energy unless you're Elon Musk and you are a disruptor and you do not heal to the principle narrative of these Marxist Dems.
[01:28:39.938 --> 01:28:45.362]  And then suddenly you've got the SEC, you've got the FTC, and every... The EU?
[01:28:45.562 --> 01:28:46.103]  The EU?
[01:28:46.903 --> 01:28:48.004]  Coming right after you.
[01:28:48.504 --> 01:28:52.907]  And he'll be performing before the SEC, I think, next week.
[01:28:53.948 --> 01:28:54.749]  That's where we are.
[01:28:54.849 --> 01:28:55.769]  We're talking with Alex Jones.
[01:28:59.235 --> 01:28:59.875]  I'm not perfect.
[01:28:59.895 --> 01:29:00.715]  I'm under a lot of stress.
[01:29:00.735 --> 01:29:04.956]  But if I didn't have the supplements we have, we promote, I wouldn't be able to continue to be on air.
[01:29:05.536 --> 01:29:13.657]  And when you go to Infowarsstore.com, you are funding the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists in an operation that the enemy admits has been the most effective at exposing them.
[01:29:13.858 --> 01:29:15.458]  Because we're fearless and we don't back down.
[01:29:15.818 --> 01:29:16.738]  We got God on our side.
[01:29:17.098 --> 01:29:18.618]  But God needs to work through you.
[01:29:18.938 --> 01:29:22.959]  You've got to make the decision to get great products you already need at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:29:22.999 --> 01:29:24.239]  And that is a 360 win.
[01:29:24.839 --> 01:29:27.800]  Nitric Boost, without me even knowing, became our number three bestseller.
[01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:30.081]  Because people loved it so much.
[01:29:30.101 --> 01:29:31.061]  They had such great effects.
[01:29:31.361 --> 01:29:37.523]  Got all these natural compounds that clean out the blood, open up your arteries and veins, the capillaries, clean out your heart, your brain, everything.
[01:29:38.323 --> 01:29:40.063]  Well, we got an even better manufacturer.
[01:29:40.083 --> 01:29:44.905]  The other one was great, but one that's even better with even higher quality ingredients at a lower price.
[01:29:45.925 --> 01:29:48.347]  So I could never offer nitric boosters.
[01:29:48.367 --> 01:29:49.847]  It cost us so much to make.
[01:29:50.648 --> 01:29:52.869]  And now we can offer it for 40% off.
[01:29:53.390 --> 01:29:57.192]  Infowarsstore.com nitric boosts finally back in stock.
[01:29:57.212 --> 01:29:58.793]  40% off out of the gates.
[01:29:59.033 --> 01:30:00.894]  But folks, we're standing up for our rights.
[01:30:00.914 --> 01:30:01.995]  We're standing up for your rights.
[01:30:02.035 --> 01:30:04.416]  We're standing up for all of our freedoms and our children.
[01:30:04.616 --> 01:30:12.281]  If you don't spread the word about the broadcast, if you don't share the links, if you don't buy products at Infowarsstore.com, then I'm not griping at you.
[01:30:12.301 --> 01:30:13.382]  I'm just saying, what are you doing?
[01:30:14.468 --> 01:30:17.791]  Less than 1% of you ever buy a product at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:18.672 --> 01:30:26.580]  If just half a percent more would go buy a book or a film or a t-shirt or get some of our great supplements and then reorder them because they really work, just try it.
[01:30:27.201 --> 01:30:29.103]  We would be able to do so many things.
[01:30:29.483 --> 01:30:33.267]  I'm praying to God that he'll touch your heart to decide to support us.
[01:30:33.787 --> 01:30:35.549]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:37.808 --> 01:30:42.091]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the global agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[01:31:07.094 --> 01:31:20.122]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections, masquerading as vaccines.
[01:31:20.262 --> 01:31:29.308]  It is so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives oblivious, and you realize ignorance is not bliss, it equals death.
[01:31:30.933 --> 01:31:51.369]  But people are starting to really understand how serious things are, and that's a hard thing to do, because to wake up to a disturbing reality and realize that we're in the middle of a giant biological weapon war against humanity, and that there's mass sterilization that's already taking place, cutting off all the major energy sources, is really hard to deal with, but it's the reality.
[01:31:51.930 --> 01:31:56.113]  Facing it is our only chance to turn this around, because stuff's about to get really, really nasty.
[01:31:56.513 --> 01:31:57.154]  Infowars.com.
[01:31:59.082 --> 01:32:03.184]  InfoWarsStore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.
[01:32:03.805 --> 01:32:05.746]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[01:32:05.766 --> 01:32:07.506]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[01:32:07.807 --> 01:32:10.028]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[01:32:10.288 --> 01:32:11.008]  Hey, what's better?
[01:32:11.108 --> 01:32:11.589]  Knockout.
[01:32:11.949 --> 01:32:12.529]  What's better?
[01:32:13.289 --> 01:32:13.750]  Down and out.
[01:32:14.030 --> 01:32:14.510]  What's better?
[01:32:14.570 --> 01:32:16.151]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[01:32:16.831 --> 01:32:21.754]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[01:32:22.449 --> 01:32:26.033]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[01:32:26.413 --> 01:32:27.734]  That's how our bodies work.
[01:32:27.754 --> 01:32:28.655]  They're all very diverse.
[01:32:29.056 --> 01:32:39.245]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWars MD Good Night Sleep.
[01:32:39.986 --> 01:32:49.793]  This is a great formula, full of amazing safe compounds, give you deeper, cleaner, restful sleep, and it's in stock, available right now, of 25% off out of the gates.
[01:32:50.133 --> 01:32:57.958]  So get your InfoWars MD, good night's sleep today, InfoWars.com.
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:06.284]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:21.101 --> 01:33:24.967]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:33:25.487 --> 01:33:26.930]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:32.605 --> 01:33:33.346]  We're good to go.
[01:33:33.626 --> 01:33:33.886]  I think?
[01:33:53.366 --> 01:33:55.429]  Maybe we should be a little outraged at this.
[01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:21.384]  Well, look at the $90 million spending package to Ukraine and to Israel that they call a border package, and I think they'll pass to the House.
[01:34:21.444 --> 01:34:22.184]  I hope they don't.
[01:34:22.584 --> 01:34:33.069]  And the American people do get that there's billions to NGOs to pay for more illegals, and it basically gives Biden the power to even open the border up more, and they see right through it.
[01:34:33.570 --> 01:34:34.650]  But they feel powerless.
[01:34:34.730 --> 01:34:42.294]  I mean, just like you and I, at least we have platforms to warn people, and we have Border Patrol that are whistleblowing, and we have all this happening, but...
[01:34:43.638 --> 01:34:55.144]  I hate to use the World War II analogy, or maybe an Eastern Europe analogy after World War II, where Stalin's tanks are rolling into your country, and it's wrong and it's terrible, and you want it to stop, but it's really happening.
[01:34:55.604 --> 01:35:01.828]  And so I think in a way, because our government's been seized, we're spectators to this, and one of the biggest hopes is...
[01:35:02.848 --> 01:35:14.671]  Trump is wildly popular, and not a perfect person, none of us are, but would shut this down overnight, is just fighting with nine months left to try to get in there with all these false indictments.
[01:35:15.351 --> 01:35:25.274]  This is way better than any football game in sudden death overtime or basketball in overtime because that stuff's fun and I enjoy it myself, but it doesn't matter who wins the game at the end of the day.
[01:35:25.814 --> 01:35:26.555]  We're good to go.
[01:35:44.286 --> 01:35:44.886]  We're good to go.
[01:36:07.438 --> 01:36:14.728]  About the Deepwater Horizon that was based on the transcripts of the lawsuit in the British Petroleum criminal trial.
[01:36:15.288 --> 01:36:19.894]  And so the movie with Mark Wahlberg and Kurt Russell's excellent, we've seen it.
[01:36:20.816 --> 01:36:21.216]  We're good to go.
[01:36:21.236 --> 01:36:21.416]  I think?
[01:36:44.895 --> 01:36:56.048]  They said, well, we're going to... By saving $300 million in the next couple of weeks, not putting concrete in a hole to pressurize it, we're going to leverage that and make an extra billion dollars, so we don't care.
[01:36:56.389 --> 01:36:57.630]  You're ordered to do it.
[01:36:58.451 --> 01:36:59.612]  And so the engineer said...
[01:37:00.728 --> 01:37:03.870]  We'll do a stress test and just test what you said for a few minutes.
[01:37:04.510 --> 01:37:06.611]  They did a stress test, didn't blow up, turned it off.
[01:37:07.091 --> 01:37:13.054]  Just the stress test, hours later, blew it up and killed a bunch of people and the biggest oil spill in history.
[01:37:13.354 --> 01:37:28.822]  And I don't think I know, I've talked to a lot of insiders, it's that corporate attitude of people in London and Houston telling engineers on an oil drilling platform with 40 foot thousand deep well into the biggest reserve they ever found, you don't need to follow math
[01:37:29.542 --> 01:37:31.083]  You just go ahead and do whatever you want.
[01:37:31.163 --> 01:37:35.806]  And I think that's the perfect allegory on an even bigger scale of where we are.
[01:37:36.106 --> 01:37:40.309]  We have reached lunatic-level bizarreness from the ruling class.
[01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:42.390]  No question about it.
[01:37:42.671 --> 01:37:49.595]  And anyone who pays attention to the stock market, for example, has to be struck by the fact that we're $34 trillion in debt.
[01:37:51.351 --> 01:37:55.734]  We've got $2 trillion in annual deficits.
[01:37:56.214 --> 01:37:59.957]  We have another almost $10 trillion in external debt.
[01:38:00.757 --> 01:38:06.301]  Then we also have the Federal Reserve with another $8 trillion on its balance sheet that has to be worked off.
[01:38:06.821 --> 01:38:15.967]  And meanwhile, you look over to CNBC or Fox Business or whomever, and you see these sell-side figures.
[01:38:17.448 --> 01:38:24.551]  You've got to be X, B, Y Chinese stocks by the dozens.
[01:38:25.111 --> 01:38:34.294]  They're pushing American investment and savings into the Chinese economy, which is madness in of itself.
[01:38:35.775 --> 01:38:36.256]  It's remarkable.
[01:38:36.276 --> 01:38:37.937]  Which is, as you know, is imploding.
[01:38:38.178 --> 01:38:40.360]  I'm not a business expert like you, but I watch it.
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:42.202]  I'm like, wait, China's imploding?
[01:38:42.542 --> 01:38:45.505]  Why am I watching CNBC and it's almost all go to China?
[01:38:45.705 --> 01:38:47.988]  Like, I'm on a rocket scientist loop, but am I right?
[01:38:48.028 --> 01:38:49.069]  That's really bad advice.
[01:38:49.129 --> 01:38:51.031]  I mean, this makes Kramer look like a good guy.
[01:38:52.864 --> 01:39:02.050]  Well, you know, Kramer's a good guy, but the fact is he's also a corporatist guy, and that's his world, and that's understandable, but here's the real deal.
[01:39:02.530 --> 01:39:12.997]  This is the world we all live in, and it matters where we put our money, and it matters where we invest our money, and it matters where we put our plants, because the simplest truth that is in manufacturing...
[01:39:13.597 --> 01:39:28.561]  Is that the greatest innovation, the greatest inventions have to be in proximity to markets and the plants that fabricate whatever the product may be, whether it's a car, whether it is advanced technology.
[01:39:29.121 --> 01:39:33.182]  No, you can have the best technology ever, but if you don't have infrastructure to do it, you don't have it.
[01:39:33.789 --> 01:39:34.309]  We're good to go.
[01:39:58.823 --> 01:40:03.324]  How can they be on CNBC and Bloomberg advising people to go to China?
[01:40:03.745 --> 01:40:06.926]  I'm not the big business guru like you, but that sounds like really bad advice.
[01:40:07.626 --> 01:40:11.207]  Well, it's not only, you know, it's just advice.
[01:40:12.047 --> 01:40:14.908]  And the fact is, if you're a corporatist, it's wonderful advice.
[01:40:15.328 --> 01:40:16.829]  If you're a populist, it sucks.
[01:40:17.209 --> 01:40:18.830]  I mean, let's be straightforward about it.
[01:40:19.250 --> 01:40:22.951]  It's a terrible thing for this country not to even be having the conversation.
[01:40:23.584 --> 01:40:31.188]  About building plants, as Donald Trump said when he said he's going to bring back all the outsourced jobs, all of the plants back to America.
[01:40:31.208 --> 01:40:33.930]  There's so many out there, it's going to take years to bring them home.
[01:40:34.390 --> 01:40:37.532]  But if we don't, we're going to pay an even heavier price.
[01:40:38.885 --> 01:40:43.086]  So let me ask you this, because I know you're interviewing me, but it's true, you're smarter than me when it comes to business.
[01:40:43.526 --> 01:40:45.526]  I'm totally confused.
[01:40:45.566 --> 01:40:46.787]  What is your dead reckoning?
[01:40:46.807 --> 01:40:48.047]  Because I'm going to air this on my show.
[01:40:48.067 --> 01:40:48.827]  You told me during the break of good.
[01:40:48.847 --> 01:40:50.067]  I'm going to air it in a couple days.
[01:40:50.667 --> 01:40:51.688]  What is your dead reckoning?
[01:40:51.708 --> 01:40:52.968]  Because I'm trying to tell my family.
[01:40:53.008 --> 01:40:54.828]  They're concerned.
[01:40:55.408 --> 01:40:56.108]  I'm pretty smart.
[01:40:56.188 --> 01:40:57.589]  I don't know what's going to happen financially.
[01:40:57.869 --> 01:40:58.909]  That's the one area.
[01:40:59.289 --> 01:41:06.250]  I'm pretty good at other predictions, but I'm like a blind bat when it comes to finance and the economy and the Federal Reserve and inflation.
[01:41:06.270 --> 01:41:08.791]  I mean, what do you, just in a summation, really think is going on?
[01:41:08.911 --> 01:41:11.213]  I think we're good to go.
[01:41:24.033 --> 01:41:24.513]  We're good to go.
[01:41:49.478 --> 01:41:52.160]  It is right now such a complicated economy.
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:57.762]  For example, in China, we don't know if their GDP goes up 5% or 10%, whatever they say.
[01:41:57.802 --> 01:41:58.423]  That's what it is.
[01:41:58.903 --> 01:42:00.264]  Because there is no clarity.
[01:42:00.644 --> 01:42:05.887]  And right now, there is no clarity on what... So you're saying there's such a black box with derivatives in China.
[01:42:06.627 --> 01:42:09.588]  That's what it looks like to me, like what Shane Beckman fried or anybody.
[01:42:09.929 --> 01:42:10.889]  They don't even know.
[01:42:10.909 --> 01:42:13.891]  The Federal Reserve's like, oh, inflation's down.
[01:42:13.951 --> 01:42:14.511]  No, it's up.
[01:42:14.871 --> 01:42:16.132]  Oh, we're going to raise rates lower.
[01:42:16.172 --> 01:42:18.053]  To me, it looks like they don't know what they're doing.
[01:42:20.442 --> 01:42:21.563]  They know what they're doing.
[01:42:21.823 --> 01:42:23.725]  They just don't care about the consequences.
[01:42:24.206 --> 01:42:25.427]  And that's the chief difference.
[01:42:25.467 --> 01:42:28.230]  And by the way, that sounds like a political economy, doesn't it?
[01:42:28.450 --> 01:42:33.555]  Because our politicians are thinking the same way as the oligarchs and the corporatists.
[01:42:34.076 --> 01:42:38.841]  So they're backing up their investments in China and other places at the detriment of Americans.
[01:42:40.696 --> 01:42:42.678]  Oftentimes, without question.
[01:42:43.158 --> 01:42:44.719]  And certainly to their own benefit.
[01:42:44.779 --> 01:42:46.400]  But that's the beauty of capitalism.
[01:42:46.501 --> 01:42:48.602]  Raw, unfettered capitalism.
[01:42:48.642 --> 01:42:49.923]  Laissez-faire capitalism.
[01:42:50.043 --> 01:42:50.643]  Adam Smith.
[01:42:51.264 --> 01:42:56.508]  Take no responsibility for the consequences of your actions so long as they drive profits.
[01:42:57.108 --> 01:43:05.657]  A true capitalist takes responsibility and understands the impact of society and to all of his stakeholders or her stakeholders.
[01:43:06.138 --> 01:43:07.900]  And that was America 1980-1990.
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:09.101]  Well, Henry Ford wasn't unleashed.
[01:43:09.161 --> 01:43:10.403]  I'm interrupting.
[01:43:10.523 --> 01:43:11.163]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:43:11.203 --> 01:43:11.283]  No.
[01:43:11.364 --> 01:43:12.765]  You were saying 1980 unleashed.
[01:43:13.246 --> 01:43:13.686]  Say it again.
[01:43:19.022 --> 01:43:22.543]  Well, I'm saying to you that we had a compassionate conservatism.
[01:43:22.983 --> 01:43:28.706]  We had a concerned capitalism and a responsible capitalism.
[01:43:28.886 --> 01:43:36.468]  What we're witnessing today is a mad rush to unexpected, unknown, and unpredictable consequences.
[01:43:37.389 --> 01:43:39.510]  Take, for example, the investments in China.
[01:43:40.330 --> 01:43:41.370]  It could be a black hole.
[01:43:41.470 --> 01:43:44.671]  It could also be a fountain of capital.
[01:43:44.712 --> 01:43:45.712]  We don't know the answer.
[01:43:46.092 --> 01:43:46.713]  So we're sleepwalking.
[01:43:46.733 --> 01:43:47.113]  We're sleeping.
[01:43:47.133 --> 01:43:49.495]  And a world that is dominated by machines rather than something called a human.
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:13.081]  Absolutely.
[01:44:13.101 --> 01:44:27.698]  It's just an incredible moment to be alive and it makes my head spin because there's so many, like you said, so many variables going into it and it seems like the establishment only thinks first or second order.
[01:44:27.718 --> 01:44:29.940]  They're not thinking out further what it's going to do.
[01:44:31.262 --> 01:44:37.624]  And they also, and I've just been given a signal that this is your last question on your show.
[01:44:40.546 --> 01:44:48.328]  But the reality is that right now, this is a country with so many problems, desperate problems in terms of how we're going to live.
[01:44:48.748 --> 01:44:52.410]  And you mentioned your children and mine and grandchildren in my case.
[01:44:52.990 --> 01:44:54.371]  We're good to go.
[01:44:54.391 --> 01:44:54.651]  I think?
[01:45:14.420 --> 01:45:16.322]  I want to get graded on my last answer.
[01:45:17.063 --> 01:45:17.623]  I insist.
[01:45:17.663 --> 01:45:18.684]  You've been asking all the time.
[01:45:18.704 --> 01:45:22.909]  I have to get an A. It's A through F. Well, I'm interesting.
[01:45:23.229 --> 01:45:24.510]  I'm interesting, but you're even more interesting.
[01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:27.794]  It's true, and I'm going to air this on my show, and you need to come on my show as soon as you can.
[01:45:28.114 --> 01:45:28.614]  It's been 10 years.
[01:45:30.191 --> 01:45:31.032]  We're good to go.
[01:45:31.072 --> 01:45:32.172]  We're good to go.
[01:45:56.169 --> 01:45:58.450]  Because at the end of the day, have all the math, the numbers.
[01:45:58.490 --> 01:45:59.130]  He's a good guy.
[01:45:59.150 --> 01:45:59.771]  He means well.
[01:46:00.071 --> 01:46:01.151]  He agrees with us on most things.
[01:46:01.211 --> 01:46:08.194]  But gut level, obviously better than Michelle Obama or Gavin Newsom or Biden or any of them.
[01:46:08.515 --> 01:46:09.475]  We need Trump.
[01:46:10.616 --> 01:46:13.457]  Gut level, do you think Trump can make it through all this and get in?
[01:46:13.477 --> 01:46:15.898]  A and B, what can we do to get him in?
[01:46:17.113 --> 01:46:19.074]  Well, the answer is he has to get in.
[01:46:19.774 --> 01:46:20.894]  He is committed to that.
[01:46:21.174 --> 01:46:27.456]  I wish that more Americans were as committed as he to his leadership and to this great nation.
[01:46:28.497 --> 01:46:34.379]  The MAGA world, all of us deplorables, America first, we're going to be there.
[01:46:34.459 --> 01:46:36.699]  But we've got to do even more than just vote for him.
[01:46:36.739 --> 01:46:38.220]  We've got to be part of our community.
[01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:39.400]  We're good to go.
[01:46:39.420 --> 01:46:39.680]  I think?
[01:47:03.388 --> 01:47:14.413]  Rather than letting this world wash over us in terms of big questions and nonsense spewed by the propagandists that we call government spokesmen.
[01:47:15.434 --> 01:47:16.955]  Well, I don't want things for sure in closing.
[01:47:16.995 --> 01:47:17.715]  Thanks for having me on.
[01:47:20.401 --> 01:47:22.602]  Well, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:22.662 --> 01:47:23.422]  Alex Jones and Lou Dobbs.
[01:47:49.935 --> 01:47:51.696]  I've got news I want to get to in the next hour and
[01:48:20.128 --> 01:48:21.789]  It is the most viewed interview of all time.
[01:48:47.159 --> 01:48:56.506]  From a political standpoint, I believe it has close to a quarter billion views, if not surpassing a quarter billion views on X alone.
[01:48:57.506 --> 01:49:03.851]  But it's also been picked up and shared by the Kremlin's official YouTube channel, Tucker Carlson on YouTube, us at InfoWars.
[01:49:03.891 --> 01:49:06.773]  We had hundreds of thousands of people watching it live that night.
[01:49:07.854 --> 01:49:11.757]  This interview maybe has been seen 500 million times, if not more.
[01:49:13.758 --> 01:49:15.960]  But just having that interview is somehow...
[01:49:17.944 --> 01:49:19.445]  But he has been going to Russian...
[01:49:48.510 --> 01:49:52.911]  Subways, grocery stores, doing reports from the streets, just talking about life in Russia.
[01:49:53.531 --> 01:49:58.393]  I don't think Tucker is going to be the last to do a documentary style like this.
[01:49:58.533 --> 01:50:01.673]  His are just more kind of in the spur of the moment type of things.
[01:50:01.913 --> 01:50:06.915]  There are going to be actual documentaries about this coming out soon.
[01:50:09.315 --> 01:50:11.336]  The mainstream media, the deep state,
[01:50:12.995 --> 01:50:19.781]  The military-industrial complex, they want us, that is the United States and Russia, to be at arms, to hate one another.
[01:50:20.462 --> 01:50:24.605]  They want their Cold War era approach and foreign policy still intact.
[01:50:24.645 --> 01:50:26.147]  They want NATO to be well-funded.
[01:50:26.847 --> 01:50:31.712]  So they have to have you hating Russia, thinking Russia is the biggest threat to you, and all the other propaganda.
[01:50:31.732 --> 01:50:33.874]  Well, maybe Putin's a bad guy, maybe Putin's a good guy.
[01:50:34.294 --> 01:50:35.255]  Russia's not my problem.
[01:50:38.342 --> 01:50:40.023]  My problem is all the corruption that exists...
[01:51:08.015 --> 01:51:12.516]  In our justice system like Fannie Willis that we've just seen.
[01:51:14.256 --> 01:51:14.997]  That's my problem.
[01:51:15.937 --> 01:51:17.737]  Putin, good or bad, not my problem.
[01:51:17.797 --> 01:51:20.558]  Putin did kill, didn't kill Mulvaney, not my problem.
[01:51:22.038 --> 01:51:26.739]  They don't care about American journalists that Ukraine butchers and kills, like Gonzalo Lira.
[01:51:28.460 --> 01:51:35.061]  We barely hear a peep about the genocide going on in Gaza, but oh, now Mulvaney's the biggest story, Putin's the biggest problem, that's what we need to be talking about.
[01:51:36.362 --> 01:51:37.542]  That's what we need to be concerned about.
[01:51:39.909 --> 01:51:41.069]  But see, here's the issue.
[01:51:41.509 --> 01:51:59.234]  And this is why a lot of people believe that it's nothing but propaganda with the intelligence agencies saying Russia is about to hit us with a space nuke to now saying Putin killed Alexei Navalny in a Russian prison.
[01:52:01.095 --> 01:52:03.275]  They're losing the narrative war on Russia.
[01:52:03.315 --> 01:52:06.856]  They're losing the narrative war and the literal war in Ukraine.
[01:52:07.296 --> 01:52:09.197]  They don't have the support of the American people.
[01:52:10.970 --> 01:52:17.074]  Now, the dangerous part of this is that they now view Joe Biden as a lame duck president.
[01:52:18.975 --> 01:52:37.827]  And we talked about this a little bit yesterday, and maybe we can take some calls on this, but they view Joe Biden as a lame duck president, meaning they'll commit all types of evil, not just against the American people, but in Ukraine or in the Gaza Strip or anywhere.
[01:52:38.668 --> 01:52:40.369]  They'll commit all kinds of evil against
[01:52:42.793 --> 01:52:55.277]  With America and Joe Biden represented when these evil acts are committed and they just say, well, it doesn't matter if this hurts Joe Biden's polls.
[01:52:55.357 --> 01:52:58.898]  It doesn't matter if this hurts Joe Biden's legacy because he's a lame duck president.
[01:52:58.958 --> 01:53:01.518]  We're either not going to run him again or he can't run again.
[01:53:01.999 --> 01:53:03.079]  So that's what's dangerous.
[01:53:06.337 --> 01:53:11.321]  We have such corruption in our government and such corruption in our media.
[01:53:11.861 --> 01:53:17.165]  They let the Kiev Ukraine regime kill an American journalist, Gonzalo Lira.
[01:53:18.907 --> 01:53:20.988]  And then they tell you, you need to be worried about Putin.
[01:53:21.128 --> 01:53:22.810]  He just killed Alexei Novani.
[01:53:23.150 --> 01:53:24.030]  They have space nukes.
[01:53:24.050 --> 01:53:24.811]  They're your big enemy.
[01:53:24.871 --> 01:53:26.352]  We need to keep fighting them in Ukraine.
[01:53:27.073 --> 01:53:29.234]  We need more money and we need more money after that.
[01:53:29.314 --> 01:53:30.796]  And we need even more money after that.
[01:53:32.257 --> 01:53:33.197]  And we're going to need more money.
[01:53:33.538 --> 01:53:35.199]  And then they write it into this bill saying,
[01:53:37.796 --> 01:53:47.199]  And they say, not only is this bill good for this $95 billion, but also any president in the future that refuses to fund Ukraine, they're now committing treason.
[01:53:47.439 --> 01:53:55.141]  So in other words, they're setting up Trump if he gets in, where if he cuts off the funding to NATO or Ukraine, they're going to hit him with impeachment or try to charge him for crimes.
[01:53:56.881 --> 01:53:59.742]  So, I mean, that's how corrupt our establishment is.
[01:54:00.302 --> 01:54:02.123]  That's how corrupt our government is.
[01:54:03.686 --> 01:54:12.110]  And so as they're losing the narrative war in Russia, now all of a sudden they're building this up as Putin being the bad guy and they have space nukes and everything else.
[01:54:14.231 --> 01:54:19.373]  But it couldn't be more obvious propaganda whether Putin had Novani killed or not.
[01:54:23.635 --> 01:54:24.796]  Because that's what it's really all about.
[01:54:24.856 --> 01:54:27.397]  It's really all about continuing to support the war forever.
[01:54:28.379 --> 01:54:33.521]  Continuing to have Russia as the boogeyman so they can continue to fund and arm NATO.
[01:54:34.562 --> 01:54:35.822]  They need that boogeyman.
[01:54:35.862 --> 01:54:37.463]  They need that perpetual enemy.
[01:54:38.943 --> 01:54:47.707]  So they have to run the propaganda as the American people are finally starting to wake up and think, well, maybe Putin is a bad guy or a good guy, but he's not my problem.
[01:54:48.507 --> 01:54:50.108]  My problem is Chuck Schumer.
[01:54:50.348 --> 01:54:51.689]  My problem is Lindsey Graham.
[01:54:52.289 --> 01:54:53.509]  My problem is Joe Biden.
[01:54:53.549 --> 01:54:54.870]  My problem is Merrick Garland.
[01:54:56.328 --> 01:55:01.332]  My problem is Fannie Willis and all the carbon copies of her across the country, like Alvin Bragg.
[01:55:06.377 --> 01:55:19.709]  But then, to put the bow on top of it, Tucker Carlson goes to Russian subways, Russian grocery stores, and I think that this is the one that really hurts him.
[01:55:22.383 --> 01:55:28.586]  Because this is the other realization that the American people have had, and it's long overdue, and it's inevitable.
[01:55:30.508 --> 01:55:35.310]  Why is it, if I want to go downtown, you name the city?
[01:55:35.751 --> 01:55:47.117]  I mean, Austin's pretty nice overall, but you drive your car in downtown, you're going to hit 10 potholes, you're going to see 500 homeless people, you're going to see some derangement, you're going to see some decay.
[01:55:47.257 --> 01:55:48.097]  It's not as bad here.
[01:55:48.137 --> 01:55:50.619]  It's kind of a new and upcoming city, but now it's setting in here, too.
[01:55:52.861 --> 01:55:58.705]  But, I mean, you go to some of the classic major metropolitan areas, your St.
[01:55:58.745 --> 01:56:07.150]  Louis, your Chicago, your Baltimore, some of those areas, just completely in decay, completely in destruction, overwhelmed with violence.
[01:56:07.490 --> 01:56:16.815]  You had that shooting at the Kansas City Super Bowl parade, and they just say, oh, this is just some gang violence, these are just some young thug gang violence, and they won't even release the names.
[01:56:17.556 --> 01:56:22.359]  Well, yeah, you go to some parts of Kansas City, you go to the west side of Kansas City, you're up all night, you're going to hear gunshots.
[01:56:24.693 --> 01:56:25.153]  We're good to go.
[01:56:49.755 --> 01:56:50.255]  We're good to go.
[01:57:18.917 --> 01:57:22.518]  And love Putin, hate Putin, think he's the bad guy or the good guy.
[01:57:22.998 --> 01:57:24.678]  Russians don't live like this, folks.
[01:57:27.419 --> 01:57:29.959]  Russians don't live like this.
[01:57:30.339 --> 01:57:38.561]  These videos we're showing you of the streets of Philadelphia, or it could be San Francisco, or it could be Baltimore, you don't see this in Russia.
[01:57:39.261 --> 01:57:45.442]  Because their government doesn't steal all their money and give it to themselves and give it to wars like ours does.
[01:57:49.167 --> 01:57:54.888]  I'm not perfect and I'm under a lot of stress, but if I didn't have the supplements we have, we promote, I wouldn't be able to continue to be on air.
[01:57:55.469 --> 01:58:03.590]  And when you go to InfoWarsStore.com, you are funding the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists in an operation that the enemy admits has been the most effective at exposing them.
[01:58:03.791 --> 01:58:05.411]  Because we're fearless and we don't back down.
[01:58:05.751 --> 01:58:06.771]  We got God on our side.
[01:58:07.031 --> 01:58:08.552]  But God needs to work through you.
[01:58:08.872 --> 01:58:12.893]  You've got to make the decision to get great products you already need at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:58:12.933 --> 01:58:14.173]  And that is a 360 win.
[01:58:14.773 --> 01:58:17.754]  Nitric Boost, without me even knowing, became our number three bestseller.
[01:58:18.434 --> 01:58:20.036]  Because people loved it so much.
[01:58:20.056 --> 01:58:20.997]  They had such great effects.
[01:58:21.297 --> 01:58:27.464]  Got all these natural compounds that clean out the blood, open up your arteries and veins, the capillaries, clean out your heart, your brain, everything.
[01:58:28.264 --> 01:58:30.006]  Well, we got an even better manufacturer.
[01:58:30.026 --> 01:58:34.851]  The other one was great, but one that's even better with even higher quality ingredients at a lower price.
[01:58:35.872 --> 01:58:38.154]  So I could never offer nitric boosts.
[01:58:38.214 --> 01:58:39.735]  It cost us so much to make.
[01:58:40.576 --> 01:58:42.778]  And now we can offer it for 40% off.
[01:58:43.338 --> 01:58:47.802]  Infowarsstore.com, nitric boosts finally back in stock.
[01:58:47.822 --> 01:58:48.743]  40% off out of the gates.
[01:58:49.023 --> 01:58:52.546]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[01:58:52.926 --> 01:58:59.952]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[01:59:00.132 --> 01:59:02.133]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[01:59:02.313 --> 01:59:03.414]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[01:59:03.434 --> 01:59:04.095]  He loved the idea.
[01:59:04.415 --> 01:59:07.936]  What would you call the debate and discussion about a pro-human future?
[01:59:07.976 --> 01:59:08.837]  Just Team Humanity?
[01:59:08.917 --> 01:59:09.797]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[01:59:09.937 --> 01:59:10.397]  Absolutely.
[01:59:10.697 --> 01:59:12.098]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[01:59:12.158 --> 01:59:15.659]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[01:59:15.839 --> 01:59:23.302]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to give Infowars on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[01:59:23.542 --> 01:59:29.104]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a revolution.
[01:59:29.224 --> 01:59:30.005]  We're good to go.
[01:59:30.065 --> 01:59:30.785]  We're good to go.
[02:00:03.509 --> 02:00:09.076]  So the economy here is so bad in the United States of America, and it's all policy-driven for the most part.
[02:00:09.136 --> 02:00:14.322]  High taxes, high inflation, the attack on American energy.
[02:00:15.987 --> 02:00:16.667]  We're good to go.
[02:00:39.793 --> 02:00:41.073]  That's the state of the U.S.
[02:00:41.113 --> 02:00:42.293]  economy, and it's obvious.
[02:00:42.333 --> 02:00:48.294]  You go to the grocery store, you've probably noticed that since 2019, your grocery bill has close to doubled.
[02:00:50.715 --> 02:00:55.276]  Unless you just want to eat junk food all day, but produce, meats, that stuff has doubled.
[02:00:55.316 --> 02:01:00.116]  So here's Tucker Carlson visiting a Russian grocery store where they're not having those problems.
[02:01:00.977 --> 02:01:08.658]  So a long-standing feature, maybe the longest-standing feature of Cold War propaganda in the West was the Soviet grocery store.
[02:01:09.930 --> 02:01:15.112]  No products, no choices, shoddily made things.
[02:01:16.233 --> 02:01:17.834]  And it wasn't actually propaganda, it was real.
[02:01:18.074 --> 02:01:19.974]  And you can look up the pictures on the internet if you want.
[02:01:20.575 --> 02:01:28.978]  So we thought it would be interesting to take a look at a contemporary, modern day, 2024 Russian grocery store two years into sanctions.
[02:01:29.739 --> 02:01:30.079]  Here we go.
[02:01:30.099 --> 02:01:32.840]  All right.
[02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:34.101]  Here we go.
[02:01:34.981 --> 02:01:38.883]  So I guess you put in 10 rubles here and you get it back
[02:01:40.066 --> 02:01:41.307]  When you put the cart back.
[02:01:42.748 --> 02:01:47.972]  So it's free, but there's an incentive to return it and not just bring it to your homeless encampment.
[02:01:49.133 --> 02:01:53.236]  Okay, this is the grocery cart escalator.
[02:01:53.857 --> 02:02:00.642]  This is designed, I'm figuring this out now, where the wheels don't move, they lock on the grocery cart escalator.
[02:02:00.922 --> 02:02:01.983]  Look Ma, no hands.
[02:02:05.358 --> 02:02:07.360]  Retail placement here is a little bit different.
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:10.101]  It's like walking through Macy's to get to Whole Foods.
[02:02:10.442 --> 02:02:13.664]  Okay, we've gotten through the perfume section to get to the grocery store.
[02:02:14.164 --> 02:02:16.365]  So they called Tucker a Putin apologist.
[02:02:16.466 --> 02:02:24.070]  Oh, you mean it's a Putin apologist if you don't like American cities taken over by crime and violence and poverty and your grocery bill doubling.
[02:02:24.170 --> 02:02:25.391]  Well, you're a Putin apologist.
[02:02:25.611 --> 02:02:29.054]  The low-carb lifestyle has not swept Russia.
[02:02:30.675 --> 02:02:32.356]  Thank heaven, because, I mean, look at that.
[02:02:33.706 --> 02:02:34.366]  It's fresh, too.
[02:02:34.427 --> 02:02:35.487]  Look at that.
[02:02:36.048 --> 02:02:38.009]  Oh, come on.
[02:02:39.470 --> 02:02:41.371]  Unicorn and Minnie Mills.
[02:02:42.772 --> 02:02:45.534]  All right.
[02:02:45.634 --> 02:02:52.458]  Some kind of Russian wheat cookies.
[02:02:53.459 --> 02:02:55.340]  We need coffee, don't we?
[02:02:57.807 --> 02:03:03.412]  I don't know if this is sugar or flour, to be honest with you, but it looks like a staple, so we should get it.
[02:03:03.592 --> 02:03:05.013]  It's a very good-looking package.
[02:03:05.033 --> 02:03:06.254]  It's got to be flour, right?
[02:03:07.075 --> 02:03:08.116]  And this is Russian wine.
[02:03:08.176 --> 02:03:19.025]  It's from Crimea, which not only has the warm water naval base, but also is the source of most of the grapes in this part of Russia for wine.
[02:03:19.385 --> 02:03:20.186]  So it's apparently pretty good.
[02:03:24.867 --> 02:03:25.387]  Cheese puffs?
[02:03:25.487 --> 02:03:30.108]  You check out of a grocery store and you've got gum, razor blades, and candy.
[02:03:30.168 --> 02:03:32.309]  Actually, they hide the razor blades because we steal them.
[02:03:33.189 --> 02:03:35.389]  But these are all, seem to be Western products.
[02:03:35.590 --> 02:03:44.632]  Mars, Twix, Snickers, Milky Way, Bounty, Gillette, Paul's Cough Drops, Mentos.
[02:03:46.952 --> 02:03:50.013]  It's pretty non-sanctioned to me, but what do I know?
[02:03:51.522 --> 02:03:54.523]  I went from amused to legitimately angry.
[02:03:56.643 --> 02:03:58.184]  So we were guessing what this would cost.
[02:03:58.264 --> 02:04:00.624]  Everybody here is from the United States, buys groceries.
[02:04:00.784 --> 02:04:04.525]  And we didn't pay any attention to costs as we were just putting in the cart where we would actually eat over a week.
[02:04:05.686 --> 02:04:08.786]  And we all came in around $400, about $400.
[02:04:10.347 --> 02:04:12.667]  It was $104 US here.
[02:04:13.427 --> 02:04:18.249]  And that's when you start to realize that ideology maybe doesn't matter as much as you thought.
[02:04:18.409 --> 02:04:19.129]  Corruption.
[02:04:20.069 --> 02:04:33.894]  If you take people's standard of living and you tank it through filth and crime and inflation, and they literally can't buy the groceries they want, at that point, maybe it matters less what you say or whether you're a good person or a bad person.
[02:04:34.094 --> 02:04:37.695]  You're wrecking people's lives and their country, and that's what our leaders have done to us.
[02:04:38.395 --> 02:04:40.916]  And coming to a Russian grocery store, the heart of evil,
[02:04:41.756 --> 02:04:47.684]  In seeing what things cost and how people live, it will radicalize you against our leaders.
[02:04:47.744 --> 02:04:48.825]  That's how I feel anyway.
[02:04:49.145 --> 02:04:49.886]  Radicalized.
[02:04:49.906 --> 02:04:52.069]  We're not making any of this up, by the way.
[02:04:52.269 --> 02:04:52.470]  At all.
[02:04:59.124 --> 02:05:00.025]  Hello, Americans.
[02:05:00.825 --> 02:05:02.426]  I want to share with you a story.
[02:05:03.087 --> 02:05:09.351]  A story about inflammation, the silent menace that lurks within our bodies, affecting our health and well-being.
[02:05:10.412 --> 02:05:16.216]  Inflammation, the root cause of countless ailments, quietly wreaking havoc over time.
[02:05:17.277 --> 02:05:24.922]  Long-term exposure to inflammation has been linked to a myriad of health issues, from heart disease to arthritis, even cognitive decline.
[02:05:25.959 --> 02:05:33.532]  But fear not, for there's a beacon of hope found in the wisdom of nature, a remedy that has stood the test of time, turmeric.
[02:05:34.326 --> 02:05:47.632]  And now I present to you Baudis from InfoWarsStore.com, a powerful blend crafted with precision, boasting 95% curcuminoids extracted from turmeric.
[02:05:47.772 --> 02:05:49.732]  It's good for your heart, your brain, everything.
[02:05:49.872 --> 02:05:57.436]  It is 40% off, back in stock, Baudis Ultimate Turmeric Formula, InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:06:03.573 --> 02:06:09.598]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[02:06:10.018 --> 02:06:11.759]  It's Owen Troyer.
[02:06:12.380 --> 02:06:15.142]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:19.785 --> 02:06:24.829]  So you just saw it there from Tucker Carlson.
[02:06:24.889 --> 02:06:29.893]  And I think, if there is anything else to say there, in fairness, the U.S.
[02:06:29.953 --> 02:06:32.155]  dollar is still pretty strong around the world.
[02:06:34.279 --> 02:06:37.060]  And it might not be as strong as it once was.
[02:06:38.180 --> 02:06:39.841]  And certainly there is an attack on the U.S.
[02:06:39.861 --> 02:06:40.201]  dollar.
[02:06:40.241 --> 02:06:41.561]  It's also coming from within.
[02:06:41.581 --> 02:06:52.145]  Well, yeah, what do you think happens when you print a bunch of money and fund all these wars and then kill American energy and ship all of our production and manufacturing overseas?
[02:06:52.185 --> 02:06:53.465]  Yeah, that doesn't really help us either.
[02:06:53.585 --> 02:06:54.745]  That's all policy related.
[02:06:58.006 --> 02:06:59.887]  But even if you consider...
[02:07:01.069 --> 02:07:01.729]  We're good to go.
[02:07:01.789 --> 02:07:02.370]  We're good to go.
[02:07:28.001 --> 02:07:28.881]  They hate this country.
[02:07:28.901 --> 02:07:30.162]  You shouldn't be surprised by that.
[02:07:30.682 --> 02:07:34.363]  The frustration is having Americans that don't understand this.
[02:07:36.103 --> 02:07:45.845]  But they put so much hate in the heart of the average liberal that they'll walk around gladly paying high energy costs, high energy bills, high grocery bills, and just say it's better than Trump.
[02:07:45.865 --> 02:07:47.926]  It could be a nuclear holocaust if they say it's better than Trump.
[02:07:51.089 --> 02:07:55.811]  Telling story, but oh, I guess that's a Putin apologist, or that's Russian propaganda.
[02:07:55.852 --> 02:07:56.692]  No, that's just the truth.
[02:07:57.212 --> 02:07:58.653]  We get screwed by our government.
[02:08:00.394 --> 02:08:04.656]  We get policy that hurts our energy prices and then hurts our grocery bill prices.
[02:08:04.896 --> 02:08:05.557]  That's what we get.
[02:08:05.977 --> 02:08:08.078]  By the way, our food is unhealthy too, but that's another story.
[02:08:11.059 --> 02:08:15.602]  And then to just make that observation and compare and contrast with Russia, or it could be any country...
[02:08:17.386 --> 02:08:22.427]  See, that just destroys all the propaganda of Bidenomics.
[02:08:23.367 --> 02:08:31.529]  It just destroys all the propaganda that somehow Putin is this dictator working with oligarchs, crushing the Russian people.
[02:08:32.029 --> 02:08:32.709]  All inaccurate.
[02:08:34.269 --> 02:08:35.029]  All inaccurate.
[02:08:36.710 --> 02:08:37.590]  But it doesn't stop there.
[02:08:37.610 --> 02:08:41.570]  I'm not sure which is worse, really.
[02:08:41.771 --> 02:08:44.131]  I'd say they're both about equal, all things considered.
[02:08:47.830 --> 02:08:48.311]  We're good to go.
[02:09:06.553 --> 02:09:06.973]  We're good to go.
[02:09:07.073 --> 02:09:07.253]  I think?
[02:09:32.028 --> 02:09:32.568]  We're good to go.
[02:09:32.588 --> 02:09:32.788]  I think?
[02:09:59.586 --> 02:10:03.047]  And it didn't take much time for the Democrats to fuck this city up to.
[02:10:04.227 --> 02:10:05.447]  Didn't take them much time at all.
[02:10:05.788 --> 02:10:06.328]  But they did it.
[02:10:07.028 --> 02:10:07.888]  By golly, they did it.
[02:10:08.748 --> 02:10:11.649]  And it's the same everywhere you go.
[02:10:14.430 --> 02:10:15.590]  Guys, see if you can find the video.
[02:10:15.890 --> 02:10:22.792]  Downtown Los Angeles, they just built this massive new high-end luxury apartment building.
[02:10:23.852 --> 02:10:28.073]  Right downtown, right next to the major sports venues, arenas, everything.
[02:10:29.810 --> 02:10:33.852]  Couldn't even rent out a single unit.
[02:10:35.173 --> 02:10:36.354]  Sitting there vacant.
[02:10:37.594 --> 02:10:45.699]  So a graffiti artist tags the entire building from the ground level to the top.
[02:10:45.979 --> 02:10:47.040]  Entire building tag.
[02:10:50.602 --> 02:10:51.402]  So that's what you see.
[02:10:51.942 --> 02:10:52.723]  But that's like...
[02:10:53.885 --> 02:10:54.625]  We're good to go.
[02:11:23.244 --> 02:11:36.333]  You have hecklers and beggars and criminals.
[02:11:36.693 --> 02:11:37.954]  It's an uncomfortable experience.
[02:11:38.374 --> 02:11:42.737]  But here was Tucker Carlson's experience riding the subway in Moscow.
[02:11:43.800 --> 02:11:49.142]  As you understand, a society is through its infrastructure, the places where people gather, the places where they go to travel.
[02:11:49.162 --> 02:11:52.224]  If you've got a lot of people in one place, it tells you a lot about the people.
[02:11:52.904 --> 02:11:57.626]  So with that in mind, we're standing in front of the Kievskaya metro station and this train station next to it.
[02:11:57.666 --> 02:12:01.268]  Now, the metro station was built by Joseph Stalin 70 years ago.
[02:12:02.088 --> 02:12:05.770]  And the question is, how's it doing now, after 70 years?
[02:12:06.530 --> 02:12:09.972]  So we went into it to take a look, and what we found shocked us.
[02:12:11.912 --> 02:12:17.575]  Now, that's not an endorsement of Stalin, who was bad, obviously, nor is it an endorsement of the current president, Vladimir Putin.
[02:12:17.595 --> 02:12:18.695]  You may not like him either.
[02:12:20.236 --> 02:12:24.298]  But it doesn't change the reality of what we saw, or more precisely, didn't see.
[02:12:24.819 --> 02:12:25.559]  There's no graffiti.
[02:12:25.779 --> 02:12:26.479]  There's no filth.
[02:12:26.659 --> 02:12:27.860]  There are no foul smells.
[02:12:28.260 --> 02:12:33.323]  There are no bums or drug addicts or rapists or people waiting to push you onto the train tracks and kill you.
[02:12:34.389 --> 02:12:34.589]  No.
[02:12:35.390 --> 02:12:37.251]  It's perfectly clean and orderly.
[02:12:38.251 --> 02:12:39.252]  And how do you explain that?
[02:12:39.472 --> 02:12:40.673]  We're not even going to guess.
[02:12:41.233 --> 02:12:42.054]  That's not our job.
[02:12:42.474 --> 02:12:43.875]  We're only going to ask the question.
[02:12:44.495 --> 02:12:52.921]  And if your response is to shout at us slogans dumber than the slogans we used to call Soviet and mock, that's not really an answer.
[02:12:53.741 --> 02:12:54.702]  How does Russia...
[02:12:55.908 --> 02:13:05.778]  A country we're told is a gas station with nuclear weapons have a subway station that normal people use to get to work and home every single day that's nicer than anything in our country.
[02:13:06.940 --> 02:13:08.721]  We're not going to speculate.
[02:13:09.342 --> 02:13:13.665]  We're just going to raise the question and wait for someone in charge to give us an answer.
[02:13:13.986 --> 02:13:14.686]  What is the answer?
[02:13:15.467 --> 02:13:26.836]  So we'll stop the lecture and let you take a look for yourself at what the Kievskaya metro station in Moscow, Russia looks like today, February 2024, in the middle of a war.
[02:13:26.856 --> 02:13:27.136]  Here it is.
[02:13:39.949 --> 02:13:48.513]  Looks like a museum.
[02:13:50.354 --> 02:13:53.235]  Looks like a library.
[02:13:55.256 --> 02:13:56.657]  Just beautiful, clean.
[02:13:59.638 --> 02:14:00.939]  Very awe-inspiring.
[02:14:00.959 --> 02:14:03.520]  Hmm.
[02:14:04.844 --> 02:14:06.926]  We could have this, but we'd rather fund wars.
[02:14:07.666 --> 02:14:10.769]  We could have this, but we'd rather fund illegal immigration.
[02:14:13.531 --> 02:14:14.612]  But Putin doesn't do that.
[02:14:16.673 --> 02:14:17.654]  So I guess he's the bad guy.
[02:14:17.674 --> 02:14:27.522]  I mean, seriously, this looks like you're walking into the nicest museum in the United States of America.
[02:14:31.993 --> 02:14:35.175]  You don't see beggars, you don't see bums, you don't see drug addicts.
[02:14:36.636 --> 02:14:42.781]  They're not erasing their history, they're not destroying their own infrastructure, their own civic centers.
[02:14:53.648 --> 02:14:55.369]  So, they're going to continue with this.
[02:14:56.710 --> 02:14:59.592]  Tucker Carlson's experience in Russia, there's a lot more of that.
[02:15:01.101 --> 02:15:05.142]  But it's not that I'm sitting here like, oh my gosh, I wish I lived in Russia.
[02:15:06.822 --> 02:15:10.523]  It's that it's understanding how we get lied to by our media.
[02:15:11.664 --> 02:15:13.944]  And it's understanding that we don't have to live like this.
[02:15:15.205 --> 02:15:16.425]  We don't have to live like this.
[02:15:16.645 --> 02:15:18.285]  We don't have to have decaying downtowns.
[02:15:18.325 --> 02:15:20.526]  We don't have to have destroyed infrastructure.
[02:15:20.786 --> 02:15:26.668]  We don't have to have homelessness and poverty and drug abuse and crime running rampant in our cities.
[02:15:27.008 --> 02:15:27.908]  We don't have to have...
[02:15:29.451 --> 02:15:34.594]  The areas of importance with our infrastructure, like subway stations, falling apart.
[02:15:36.275 --> 02:15:38.036]  An uncomfortable experience.
[02:15:38.217 --> 02:15:40.078]  It doesn't have to be like this for us.
[02:15:41.018 --> 02:15:42.399]  We could be living like kings.
[02:15:42.739 --> 02:15:44.160]  We could have the nicest airports.
[02:15:44.441 --> 02:15:50.124]  We could have the nicest subways, train stations, bus stops, infrastructure.
[02:15:50.164 --> 02:15:51.305]  We could have all of it.
[02:15:52.145 --> 02:15:53.927]  We could have all of it.
[02:15:54.907 --> 02:15:55.888]  But we don't get it
[02:15:57.332 --> 02:16:01.615]  Because we have to fund wars overseas.
[02:16:01.856 --> 02:16:02.836]  We have to fund NATO.
[02:16:03.037 --> 02:16:04.358]  We have to fund illegal immigrants.
[02:16:07.901 --> 02:16:12.644]  We have Soros attorneys that let criminals back on the streets.
[02:16:15.407 --> 02:16:20.491]  We have an economy that gives jobs to illegal immigrants or just ships entire manufacturing hubs overseas.
[02:16:22.613 --> 02:16:23.753]  So we don't get nice things.
[02:16:24.642 --> 02:16:30.883]  And then we're told and we're supposed to believe that our problem is all the way on the other side of the planet in Russia.
[02:16:34.424 --> 02:16:36.904]  And we can't even deal with the problems we have on our own streets.
[02:16:39.165 --> 02:16:51.847]  And it reminds me of this clip from formerly Kanye West, yay, where this reporter tries to entrap him with a question.
[02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:54.440]  As he's just out on the streets.
[02:16:56.281 --> 02:17:00.962]  Says, oh, what do you think about the Israeli and Palestinian conflict?
[02:17:02.043 --> 02:17:04.123]  And he says, you know, why are you asking me about that?
[02:17:05.004 --> 02:17:06.384]  I'm from the south side of Chicago.
[02:17:06.404 --> 02:17:07.824]  14 kids were just shot there.
[02:17:07.864 --> 02:17:08.945]  Why don't you ask me about that?
[02:17:11.766 --> 02:17:12.826]  And that's everything right there.
[02:17:15.450 --> 02:17:16.611]  That's how the propaganda works.
[02:17:16.811 --> 02:17:18.032]  That's how the distraction works.
[02:17:18.433 --> 02:17:42.093]  Where you're more focused on things going on on the other side of the planet that do not affect you, should not affect you, and somehow you're more invested in these things and yet your front porch is on fire, your back porch is on fire, and you're supposed to be concerned about a fire on the other side of the planet that really might not even be a fire.
[02:17:43.113 --> 02:17:43.614]  You don't even know.
[02:17:45.896 --> 02:17:46.256]  We're good to go.
[02:17:46.276 --> 02:17:46.416]  I think?
[02:18:14.048 --> 02:18:14.568]  We're good to go.
[02:18:45.205 --> 02:18:48.448]  So, we've already kind of seen some false flags going on.
[02:18:50.369 --> 02:18:55.433]  And to sit here and say that, you know, a false flag where people die is minor is a little cold-hearted.
[02:18:56.194 --> 02:19:01.578]  So I really would not like to talk like that, but I mean, that's basically what's going on.
[02:19:01.598 --> 02:19:07.583]  I mean, you could talk about the stand-down on October 7th at the Israel Music Festival.
[02:19:09.245 --> 02:19:13.268]  You could talk about the stand-down of the drone that attacked Israel.
[02:19:14.341 --> 02:19:15.442]  We're good to go.
[02:19:45.811 --> 02:19:47.792]  I can't afford my car payments.
[02:19:47.952 --> 02:19:49.353]  I can't afford my mortgage payments.
[02:19:49.493 --> 02:19:50.854]  I can't afford to buy a house.
[02:19:51.215 --> 02:19:53.816]  I can barely afford my energy bills and my grocery bills.
[02:19:53.836 --> 02:19:54.297]  Wait a second.
[02:19:54.337 --> 02:19:54.737]  Hold on.
[02:19:56.898 --> 02:20:01.401]  And then you're going to flood this country with tens of millions of illegal immigrants.
[02:20:02.362 --> 02:20:06.524]  And then you're going to pay for them and their way and everything they need.
[02:20:09.907 --> 02:20:15.010]  And then I'm going to watch them come into my city and take over all of our civic centers as well.
[02:20:17.500 --> 02:20:18.281]  We're good to go.
[02:20:18.341 --> 02:20:18.581]  I think?
[02:20:38.581 --> 02:20:49.627]  Yeah, maybe they stall the illegal immigrants in Texas for a short period of time, or maybe they do secure the border in Texas, okay, but that's not stopping the illegal immigrants from coming in.
[02:20:50.227 --> 02:20:57.811]  So here's NBC News reporting what we accurately predicted, as always, next month's news today, when all the news about Abbott and the border was coming out.
[02:20:59.419 --> 02:21:08.731]  I sat right here in the studio and I said, yeah, maybe we stop them in Texas, maybe for a month, but they're just going to go to California and Arizona like nothing ever happened.
[02:21:09.491 --> 02:21:18.022]  And now here's NBC News reporting this from the ground exactly as we predicted in clip four.
[02:21:18.677 --> 02:21:25.359]  We got here actually very early this morning and found a group of about 60 or 70 that reflected how very global migration to the U.S.
[02:21:25.399 --> 02:21:26.320]  border is today.
[02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:28.320]  There were people from Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil.
[02:21:28.600 --> 02:21:32.262]  There were people from Jamaica, from as far away as Mauritania in West Africa.
[02:21:32.562 --> 02:21:34.443]  Many of them, like I said, had been waiting here overnight.
[02:21:34.463 --> 02:21:36.503]  And on the other side of that fence, there's really nothing.
[02:21:36.843 --> 02:21:37.324]  It's dirt.
[02:21:37.364 --> 02:21:39.444]  There's nothing for them to do, no food, no water.
[02:21:39.484 --> 02:21:41.885]  There's, I think, a couple of porta-potties, and that's about it.
[02:21:42.145 --> 02:21:46.287]  There's also volunteers here who've been coming here for months because the numbers are going up here, right?
[02:21:47.687 --> 02:21:57.057]  The local sector chief for the San Diego sector posted online that in the first week of February, about 8,600 migrants were apprehended in this sector.
[02:21:57.077 --> 02:22:00.740]  If you look week by week, that's higher than it's been here in months.
[02:22:01.161 --> 02:22:11.131]  I should say that the numbers border-wide are still substantially lower than they were in December, but we're seeing them tick up and we're seeing the traffic pattern sort of shift west to here in California.
[02:22:13.123 --> 02:22:13.303]  Oh!
[02:22:14.184 --> 02:22:16.605]  The traffic patterns shift west.
[02:22:17.245 --> 02:22:21.086]  Now, you tell me how these illegal immigrant caravans knew to do that.
[02:22:23.167 --> 02:22:24.588]  Don't you see what the story here is?
[02:22:26.869 --> 02:22:28.089]  Obviously, this was predictable.
[02:22:28.149 --> 02:22:29.730]  Nothing is going to stop them from coming in.
[02:22:30.290 --> 02:22:31.211]  But what's the story here?
[02:22:31.631 --> 02:22:32.911]  They're being coached.
[02:22:34.652 --> 02:22:39.554]  This is a well-organized, well-funded, illegal immigration machine.
[02:22:41.360 --> 02:22:43.063]  Somebody's making the calls.
[02:22:44.405 --> 02:22:46.168]  Somebody's directing the traffic.
[02:22:49.273 --> 02:22:55.663]  It's the same thing that happens when 10,000 of them pour into McAllen, Texas...
[02:22:57.642 --> 02:23:02.765]  And then reporters go down there, like InfoWars, and we turn our cameras on and we film the whole thing.
[02:23:02.785 --> 02:23:03.526]  Well, then what happens?
[02:23:03.546 --> 02:23:06.768]  Well, they stop sending them to McAllen and then they send them to Brownsville.
[02:23:06.788 --> 02:23:08.249]  Well, then the media shows up in Brownsville.
[02:23:08.429 --> 02:23:11.250]  So they stop sending them to Brownsville and then they send them to El Paso.
[02:23:11.451 --> 02:23:16.113]  And then the media shows up in El Paso and they stop sending them to El Paso and they send them to Eagle Pass.
[02:23:16.434 --> 02:23:22.257]  And then the media shows up in Eagle Pass and they stop sending them to Eagle Pass and they send them to McAllen and they send them to Rio Grande Valley.
[02:23:22.477 --> 02:23:23.078]  See how it works?
[02:23:24.058 --> 02:23:26.520]  We've documented this whole damn thing.
[02:23:29.520 --> 02:23:32.261]  I ought to give a shout out here because I've been meaning to do this.
[02:23:34.062 --> 02:23:35.522]  And I'm guessing this is also a gift.
[02:23:35.542 --> 02:23:41.344]  I got another gift from our Border Patrol insider.
[02:23:41.744 --> 02:23:45.666]  Elias is what he goes by here to protect his identity, obviously.
[02:23:46.006 --> 02:23:48.967]  He also sent me a gift, a coffee mug and a little Border Patrol badge.
[02:23:50.127 --> 02:23:54.269]  I think he gave this to Alex, this metal Border Patrol badge.
[02:23:56.545 --> 02:24:01.168]  Icon here with the green striped American flag and then the Bible verse Romans 13.4 in the back.
[02:24:04.630 --> 02:24:17.358]  So I want to give a big shout out and thanks to our insider, Elias, who's giving us a lot of information and all the other insiders that we've had as well to help us report to you the truth about what's going on at the border.
[02:24:19.219 --> 02:24:20.420]  So, big shout out to him.
[02:24:22.902 --> 02:24:24.543]  But so that's why it was so predictable...
[02:24:25.785 --> 02:24:26.865]  The invasion is on, folks.
[02:24:26.885 --> 02:24:27.465]  It's not stopping.
[02:24:55.939 --> 02:24:56.799]  It's worse than ever.
[02:24:57.140 --> 02:25:00.981]  We're on pace for more than 3 million this year.
[02:25:01.201 --> 02:25:02.702]  We're actually on pace for 6 million.
[02:25:03.583 --> 02:25:04.243]  If you can believe that.
[02:25:05.543 --> 02:25:13.747]  The current pace for illegal immigrants entering the United States in 2024 is 6 million.
[02:25:14.207 --> 02:25:15.028]  That's the current pace.
[02:25:15.768 --> 02:25:16.168]  6 million.
[02:25:18.049 --> 02:25:19.850]  Somebody sent for me the statistic.
[02:25:21.811 --> 02:25:23.852]  I'm trying to pull it out of my head, but I believe it was
[02:25:26.189 --> 02:25:29.873]  It was like in 2016, there were 90 U.S.
[02:25:29.913 --> 02:25:32.335]  citizens for every one illegal immigrant.
[02:25:33.356 --> 02:25:40.102]  By the end of 2024, it's going to be, there's one illegal immigrant for every 37 U.S.
[02:25:40.142 --> 02:25:40.543]  citizens.
[02:25:42.985 --> 02:25:44.466]  Again, these numbers were sent to me this morning.
[02:25:44.486 --> 02:25:45.547]  I don't have them in front of me.
[02:25:46.468 --> 02:25:47.309]  But I think you get the point.
[02:25:48.210 --> 02:25:50.012]  And so this is what's going to become regular.
[02:25:51.397 --> 02:26:04.578]  Is the illegal immigrant crime that is sweeping through, well, maybe Kansas City too, but New York City, here's the FBI and Mayor Adams talking about the crime now from these illegal immigrant gangs in clip 11.
[02:26:05.714 --> 02:26:06.935]  First of all, thanks a lot guys.
[02:26:06.975 --> 02:26:09.036]  Listen, we saw what happened on the video and
[02:26:33.387 --> 02:26:37.169]  There are 172,000 migrant asylum seekers who are here.
[02:26:37.269 --> 02:26:41.993]  Overwhelmingly, many of these are the same thing all of our families want.
[02:26:42.073 --> 02:26:44.194]  162,000 illegal immigrants in New York City.
[02:26:45.215 --> 02:26:47.276]  Break our laws, assault our cops.
[02:26:47.497 --> 02:26:51.399]  That was not only assault on an individual, that was assault on our system.
[02:26:51.499 --> 02:26:53.581]  Well, Democrats do that for policy, so what do you care?
[02:26:53.601 --> 02:26:56.403]  They're going to use organized methods to commit crimes.
[02:26:56.503 --> 02:26:58.444]  It just can't happen, and it won't happen.
[02:26:58.604 --> 02:26:59.485]  Not in New York City.
[02:26:59.845 --> 02:27:00.425]  Oh, it will.
[02:27:00.445 --> 02:27:02.527]  It will continue to happen.
[02:27:03.407 --> 02:27:04.248]  While you're the mayor.
[02:27:04.328 --> 02:27:07.149]  No, that's exactly what it's about.
[02:27:07.169 --> 02:27:11.952]  Unless you're an American criminal, then they're going to let you back out on the streets.
[02:27:12.052 --> 02:27:14.113]  Oh, wait, they did that with the illegal immigrants, too.
[02:27:14.173 --> 02:27:15.574]  Just conducted a search warrant here.
[02:27:27.433 --> 02:27:29.135]  You're getting guns, by the way.
[02:27:29.155 --> 02:27:29.735]  We will find you.
[02:27:45.968 --> 02:27:48.210]  And the Soros District Attorney will put them right back on the street.
[02:27:48.510 --> 02:27:51.252]  Alvin Bragg will put them right back on the street.
[02:27:51.332 --> 02:27:56.436]  And then they'll get released.
[02:27:57.477 --> 02:28:00.339]  And then they get released.
[02:28:00.399 --> 02:28:02.441]  So, I mean, folks, this is only going to get worse.
[02:28:02.781 --> 02:28:03.702]  It's going to get so bad.
[02:28:04.202 --> 02:28:07.245]  Now it's just straight up gangs coming in here and taking over the cities.
[02:28:07.265 --> 02:28:09.467]  I mean, it's like the Foot Clan or something.
[02:28:10.247 --> 02:28:11.088]  It's just insane.
[02:28:13.806 --> 02:28:21.050]  So, I want to take calls to the last two segments that I'm here with you, and then Jay Dyer coming up for the fourth hour.
[02:28:21.090 --> 02:28:22.071]  The number, 877-789-2539.
[02:28:22.091 --> 02:28:22.471]  877-789-2539.
[02:28:23.052 --> 02:28:32.317]  If you want to respond to the Tucker Carlson pieces about life in Russia, or the U.S.
[02:28:32.337 --> 02:28:36.299]  propaganda telling you to hate Putin, and now he killed this guy, so hate him even more.
[02:28:36.339 --> 02:28:37.100]  We need more of your money.
[02:28:38.040 --> 02:28:38.781]  We need more war.
[02:28:40.305 --> 02:28:45.847]  Or if you want to talk about Fat Fanny Willis embarrassing herself so badly that they don't even put her on the stand again today.
[02:28:45.927 --> 02:28:48.527]  Maybe, I don't know, maybe she couldn't figure out how to put her dress on straight.
[02:28:49.648 --> 02:28:50.788]  Or the illegal immigrant issue.
[02:28:51.008 --> 02:28:53.869]  All these topics, fair game, when we come back.
[02:28:53.889 --> 02:28:54.589]  877-789-2539.
[02:28:55.429 --> 02:28:58.390]  Hello, Americans.
[02:28:59.170 --> 02:29:00.771]  I want to share with you a story.
[02:29:01.431 --> 02:29:07.653]  A story about inflammation, the silent menace that lurks within our bodies, affecting our health and well-being.
[02:29:08.749 --> 02:29:09.490]  Inflammation.
[02:29:10.170 --> 02:29:11.871]  The root cause of countless ailments.
[02:29:12.651 --> 02:29:14.633]  Quietly wreaking havoc over time.
[02:29:15.613 --> 02:29:19.676]  Long-term exposure to inflammation has been linked to a myriad of health issues.
[02:29:20.156 --> 02:29:23.518]  From heart disease to arthritis, even cognitive decline.
[02:29:24.319 --> 02:29:28.321]  But fear not, for there's a beacon of hope found in the wisdom of nature.
[02:29:29.022 --> 02:29:31.083]  A remedy that has stood the test of time.
[02:29:31.463 --> 02:29:31.943]  Turmeric.

[02:30:57.734 --> 02:31:00.275]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalist.
[02:31:00.655 --> 02:31:02.996]  And people can't identify who's a patriot and who isn't.
[02:31:03.337 --> 02:31:06.478]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalist.
[02:31:06.538 --> 02:31:09.439]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.
[02:31:09.679 --> 02:31:20.264]  That's why I designed this amazing 1776 red, white, and blue Gadsden flag shirt so you can support the Infowar and meet like-minded people everywhere when you wear it.

[02:31:33.379 --> 02:31:34.299]  We're good to go.
[02:31:34.339 --> 02:31:35.260]  We're good to go.
[02:31:57.995 --> 02:32:03.459]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[02:32:04.199 --> 02:32:08.482]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[02:32:08.882 --> 02:32:13.265]  We finally have a limited run back in supply at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:32:14.706 --> 02:32:17.488]  So many people have serious issues.
[02:32:17.748 --> 02:32:18.868]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[02:32:19.308 --> 02:32:24.731]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[02:32:25.271 --> 02:32:30.654]  Most of their iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[02:32:31.294 --> 02:32:34.196]  But this is pure atomic certified iodine.
[02:32:35.968 --> 02:32:36.268]  I don't.
[02:32:36.889 --> 02:32:39.950]  X2 is now back in stock, discounted.
[02:32:40.291 --> 02:32:43.472]  So I'm giving Thanksgiving right now for this product being here.
[02:32:43.813 --> 02:32:48.916]  It funds the InfoWar, but I guarantee you, you take this for a few weeks, you will feel the difference.
[02:32:49.076 --> 02:32:49.876]  It is amazing.
[02:32:50.196 --> 02:32:56.200]  It's the missing link, X2, back in stock at the end of 2023 at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:32:56.640 --> 02:32:57.040]  X2.
[02:32:58.981 --> 02:33:04.865]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:17.368 --> 02:33:23.856]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:24.316 --> 02:33:27.740]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:27.760 --> 02:33:31.905]  I got something that tells me what it's all about.
[02:33:35.820 --> 02:33:46.010]  All right, Joe Biden gave a five-minute press conference today talking about how you need to be really afraid of Putin and Russia, and that's the worst thing happening to you.
[02:33:46.130 --> 02:33:52.516]  Not your cities falling apart, not the violent crime taking over, not the poverty or the economic distress or the wars they continue to fund.
[02:33:53.712 --> 02:33:55.553]  And so Joe Biden had a little moment.
[02:33:55.593 --> 02:33:56.954]  He had a little Joe Biden moment.
[02:33:57.494 --> 02:34:01.736]  And even though the teleprompter was right there in front of him, he struggled to read it.
[02:34:02.096 --> 02:34:07.478]  And so I think this is why they gave him the hook early during the press conference and he couldn't take any questions.
[02:34:08.359 --> 02:34:10.159]  It's another Biden moment in clip 14.
[02:34:10.199 --> 02:34:12.861]  Now I did not pay their dues.
[02:34:13.721 --> 02:34:17.123]  He encouraged Russia to, quote, do whatever the hell they want.
[02:34:19.724 --> 02:34:19.744]  I...
[02:34:25.583 --> 02:34:30.145]  I guess I should clear my mind here a little bit and not say what I'm really thinking.
[02:34:31.225 --> 02:34:32.725]  Right, right.
[02:34:33.166 --> 02:34:34.186]  So which one is it, Joe?
[02:34:34.806 --> 02:34:41.609]  You're too incompetent to face trial, or you're a criminal that needs to face trial?
[02:34:41.829 --> 02:34:43.469]  It's one of the two, according to Robert Herr.
[02:34:44.710 --> 02:34:46.170]  And then you lied about your son again.
[02:34:46.450 --> 02:34:48.091]  It's really just a sad state of affairs.
[02:34:48.531 --> 02:34:51.052]  So again, look, you can call Putin a killer, good, bad.
[02:34:52.216 --> 02:34:53.557]  I got Biden problems, bud.
[02:34:54.577 --> 02:34:56.237]  I got big Biden problems.
[02:34:59.539 --> 02:34:59.859]  All right.
[02:34:59.919 --> 02:35:01.539]  We're going to start taking your calls now.
[02:35:01.699 --> 02:35:05.961]  Again, we can talk about Fat Fannie Willis and that embarrassment.
[02:35:05.981 --> 02:35:11.823]  We can talk about the illegal immigration issue that's going to be worse than ever in 2024 for the fourth straight year under Joe Biden.
[02:35:11.843 --> 02:35:13.644]  We're going to have a record number of illegal immigrants.
[02:35:14.898 --> 02:35:15.278]  We're good to go.
[02:35:34.818 --> 02:35:44.440]  And speaking of blood flow, we've got a great supplement for that at InfoWarsStore.com and that is Nitric Boost, doctor recommended right here on the show.
[02:35:45.200 --> 02:35:52.002]  Nitric Boost, when you want to talk about blood flow and cardiovascular health, Nitric Boost is the answer.

[02:36:00.976 --> 02:36:03.017]  If you're not taking Nitric Boost.
[02:36:03.257 --> 02:36:05.098]  Do you even respect your own vasculature?
[02:36:06.159 --> 02:36:12.522]  You should, and you should take Nitric Boost from InfoWarsStore.com to show that you do.

[02:36:36.707 --> 02:36:38.067]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:36:39.087 --> 02:36:40.468]  Okay, here we go to the calls.
[02:36:41.888 --> 02:36:44.329]  Let's start with Jeff in South Carolina.
[02:36:44.389 --> 02:36:45.189]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[02:36:45.209 --> 02:36:45.629]  Go ahead.
[02:36:45.649 --> 02:36:48.090]  Hey, this is Owen.
[02:36:48.450 --> 02:36:48.710]  Yes.
[02:36:49.750 --> 02:36:51.151]  Hey, God bless you, man.
[02:36:51.351 --> 02:36:52.931]  I do appreciate everything you went through.
[02:36:53.171 --> 02:36:58.813]  Listen, I was wanting to tell you about, remember back in the last financial crisis, I guess it was Paulson came out?
[02:36:59.528 --> 02:37:05.673]  And said, told Congress, you got to pass this bill to give all this money or else everything's going to collapse.
[02:37:05.993 --> 02:37:12.658]  I think that's what's going on with us giving money to Ukraine because it's kind of like all of a sudden, oh, we need another $60 billion.
[02:37:12.698 --> 02:37:15.980]  You know, that's going to cover some other, you know, payment they got to have.
[02:37:16.761 --> 02:37:18.362]  And that's what I think is going on.
[02:37:18.382 --> 02:37:24.046]  That's why we keep seeing everything improve from both sides because I think they're afraid of everything collapsing.
[02:37:24.086 --> 02:37:26.288]  So they're just buying themselves time.
[02:37:27.006 --> 02:37:28.386]  And I also want to make another point.
[02:37:28.847 --> 02:37:29.427]  Are you still there?
[02:37:29.967 --> 02:37:31.767]  Yeah, I'm not sure I fully understand that.
[02:37:33.128 --> 02:37:34.288]  You can make your second point.
[02:37:35.148 --> 02:37:38.349]  Are you saying that Ukraine is collapsing and that's why they have to give them money?
[02:37:38.389 --> 02:37:39.489]  Because that's going on, too.
[02:37:39.730 --> 02:37:44.491]  I mean, they don't like to talk about how an entire generation of Ukrainian men has been killed in this war.
[02:37:44.851 --> 02:37:46.912]  Well, I agree, but no, no.
[02:37:46.952 --> 02:37:55.534]  My point is, Paulson, he had something to do with the Federal Reserve, and he came and told Congress that, hey, you need to pass this bill
[02:37:56.385 --> 02:37:59.628]  Okay, well, I mean, it's the same.
[02:37:59.708 --> 02:38:02.670]  I don't know if the two are connected, but it's the same argument.
[02:38:02.690 --> 02:38:09.596]  It's like, oh, if you don't pass this bill, you're going to war, like Schumer says, or, oh, if you don't sign this omnibus bill, the banks collapse.
[02:38:09.636 --> 02:38:10.616]  It's like a hostage negotiation.
[02:38:10.656 --> 02:38:11.737]  It's an extortion tactic.
[02:38:25.686 --> 02:38:26.807]  Yeah, but here's the other thing.
[02:38:27.767 --> 02:38:33.450]  I had a good friend or acquaintance, and he's a guy of color, okay?
[02:38:34.130 --> 02:38:37.452]  And he just came to me one day and said, oh, I just hate white people.
[02:38:38.012 --> 02:38:40.153]  And I told him, I said, that's just not fair.
[02:38:40.273 --> 02:38:45.976]  I said, us white people are trying to take down the white supremacists.
[02:38:46.156 --> 02:38:47.576]  We are not the supremacists.
[02:38:47.616 --> 02:38:48.657]  The white supremacists
[02:38:49.218 --> 02:38:55.623]  Are all the people that you can show on the chart and that's head of this and head of that, and they're all white, so we need to agree to that.
[02:38:56.184 --> 02:39:01.908]  So we need to change the narrative that instead of globalists say they are the white supremacists.
[02:39:02.489 --> 02:39:16.060]  So, in fact, Joe Biden isn't lying when he says white supremacists are the problem because us that know what's going on see all the white people, you know, in Davos and all like that, that are creating a problem, and we need to change them.
[02:39:17.028 --> 02:39:23.794]  You know, this is an interesting discussion, and I actually went on a live show with Hotep Jesus yesterday to talk about this.
[02:39:24.134 --> 02:39:27.937]  You know, kind of tongue-in-cheek joking, like, I represent the white people, he represented the black people.
[02:39:29.058 --> 02:39:36.384]  And I was doing this, and people are sending me all these crime statistics and all this other stuff, and he's like, why didn't you bring this up?
[02:39:36.424 --> 02:39:37.305]  Why didn't you bring this up?
[02:39:37.605 --> 02:39:40.648]  I mean, yeah, you can point to these statistics all day long.
[02:39:40.948 --> 02:39:42.769]  You know, I brought up some of it.
[02:39:43.570 --> 02:39:47.673]  But you said something that actually he admitted to me, and I thank you for the call, Jeff.
[02:39:47.694 --> 02:39:51.176]  He said, yeah, I used to hate white people.
[02:39:51.256 --> 02:39:53.899]  I was basically trained by propaganda to hate white people.
[02:39:55.380 --> 02:40:06.189]  And then his counterpoint to me saying, well, look, there's an undeniable pattern of behavior here when it comes to black crime and when it comes to black-on-white crime, and specifically when it comes to children, white children in schools.
[02:40:06.589 --> 02:40:09.592]  And he said, but don't you see how that's now being propagandized?
[02:40:11.003 --> 02:40:13.284]  Used to make white people hate black people.
[02:40:13.905 --> 02:40:15.746]  And I mean, maybe it's a fair counterpoint.
[02:40:17.106 --> 02:40:20.568]  But it's just like, how do you even... What do you do?
[02:40:20.668 --> 02:40:24.730]  What do you do to stop the flow of hatred?
[02:40:24.810 --> 02:40:29.412]  That obviously the divide and conquer tactics are being used against us right now.
[02:40:30.673 --> 02:40:33.895]  Like, well, I mean, there's issues to address.
[02:40:35.455 --> 02:40:37.957]  But then if you address them, you're adding to the hatred.
[02:40:38.077 --> 02:40:38.357]  And so...
[02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:40.300]  I don't know.
[02:41:08.502 --> 02:41:10.503]  And just building a country that everybody can thrive in.
[02:41:10.544 --> 02:41:12.085]  But now they're just giving it to illegal immigrants.
[02:41:12.365 --> 02:41:14.206]  All right, let's go to Sergio in California.
[02:41:14.246 --> 02:41:15.187]  Sergio, you're on the air.
[02:41:17.008 --> 02:41:18.289]  Hey, good morning.
[02:41:18.449 --> 02:41:18.749]  Howdy.
[02:41:20.531 --> 02:41:22.432]  First, I wanted to plug in that nitric boost, man.
[02:41:22.452 --> 02:41:24.033]  It really makes me feel like a teenager.
[02:41:24.613 --> 02:41:26.735]  Gets your blood flowing, gets your stamina.
[02:41:27.616 --> 02:41:29.057]  Yeah.
[02:41:29.477 --> 02:41:30.918]  My topic was immigration, man.
[02:41:30.938 --> 02:41:34.520]  I was just... I'm looking at all the people coming in, and it's a damn shame.
[02:41:34.561 --> 02:41:37.903]  Like, my parents used to pride themselves on not...
[02:41:38.596 --> 02:41:40.997]  Well, look, if you come into this country legally, then you're an immigrant.
[02:41:41.017 --> 02:41:42.137]  If you don't, you're a criminal.
[02:41:42.197 --> 02:41:42.337]  Right.
[02:42:07.907 --> 02:42:14.534]  All I'm saying is that there's people that have come exactly with work visas, and they do it the right way.
[02:42:15.535 --> 02:42:16.876]  They pay their taxes.
[02:42:17.297 --> 02:42:18.498]  They wait for the nationality.
[02:42:19.159 --> 02:42:20.500]  Sure, they come with prospects.
[02:42:20.680 --> 02:42:22.582]  They have something to add to our civilization.
[02:42:23.383 --> 02:42:24.604]  But, you know, the other thing you said is so...
[02:42:25.600 --> 02:42:26.260]  Important as well.
[02:42:26.280 --> 02:42:30.882]  You said there used to be this matter of pride where you don't want to take a government handout.
[02:42:31.262 --> 02:42:34.483]  But now these individuals that come in, it's not that they just don't look at it like that.
[02:42:34.583 --> 02:42:35.523]  It's the exact opposite.
[02:42:35.603 --> 02:42:37.364]  They look at us like we're suckers.
[02:42:38.124 --> 02:42:43.566]  They look at us like we're morons that we let them into the country and then give them everything for free.
[02:42:44.326 --> 02:42:45.866]  So they just look at it like, oh, hell yeah.
[02:42:46.466 --> 02:42:47.547]  It's like a cheat code for them.
[02:42:47.587 --> 02:42:50.807]  Like, oh, I can go here and just get everything for free and these dumbass Americans will do it?
[02:42:50.987 --> 02:42:51.367]  Sweet!
[02:42:51.768 --> 02:42:53.208]  And I can rob them on the streets?
[02:42:53.588 --> 02:42:54.848]  And I can take over their rec centers?
[02:42:55.008 --> 02:42:55.388]  Awesome!
[02:42:58.089 --> 02:42:59.929]  But folks, we're standing up for our rights.
[02:42:59.969 --> 02:43:01.030]  We're standing up for your rights.
[02:43:01.070 --> 02:43:03.470]  We're standing up for all of our freedoms and our children.
[02:43:03.670 --> 02:43:11.332]  If you don't spread the word about the broadcast, if you don't share the links, if you don't buy products at InfoWarsHore.com, then I'm not griping at you.
[02:43:11.352 --> 02:43:12.412]  I'm just saying, what are you doing?
[02:43:13.530 --> 02:43:16.853]  Less than 1% of you ever buy a product at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:43:17.714 --> 02:43:25.620]  If just half a percent more would go buy a book or a film or a t-shirt or get some of our great supplements and then reorder them because they really work, just try it.
[02:43:26.241 --> 02:43:28.163]  We would be able to do so many things.
[02:43:28.543 --> 02:43:32.326]  I'm praying to God that he'll touch your heart to decide to support us.
[02:43:32.847 --> 02:43:34.648]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:43:36.749 --> 02:43:37.390]  It's been sold out.
[02:43:37.450 --> 02:43:38.210]  It's back in stock.
[02:43:38.270 --> 02:43:39.471]  Reformulated even stronger.
[02:43:40.272 --> 02:43:42.153]  Nitric boost to clean out your blood and your whole body.
[02:43:42.594 --> 02:43:43.675]  Vasodilation.
[02:43:43.695 --> 02:43:46.077]  It's got a lot of wonderful side effects.
[02:43:46.097 --> 02:43:46.797]  And I mean good ones.
[02:43:46.817 --> 02:43:47.958]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:43:48.579 --> 02:43:49.459]  It is powerful.
[02:43:49.499 --> 02:43:50.440]  So be careful with it.
[02:43:50.781 --> 02:43:51.921]  Next level foundational energy.
[02:43:52.042 --> 02:43:54.704]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:43:58.044 --> 02:43:59.285]  Bodies is back.
[02:43:59.445 --> 02:44:06.489]  The ultimate turmeric product on the market has returned to InfoWarsStore.com and is now 25% off for a limited time.
[02:44:06.849 --> 02:44:11.832]  Utilized for thousands of years, turmeric is one of the most studied medicinal herbs today.
[02:44:12.232 --> 02:44:19.877]  Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles are published every year on the chemistry and therapeutic potential of turmeric and its active components.
[02:44:20.177 --> 02:44:24.221]  But our super powerful extract used in bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients in turmeric.
[02:44:43.058 --> 02:44:46.680]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the globalist agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[02:45:05.703 --> 02:45:18.656]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections masquerading as vaccines.
[02:45:18.797 --> 02:45:27.846]  It is so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives oblivious, and you realize ignorance is not bliss, it equals death.
[02:45:29.448 --> 02:45:49.875]  But people are starting to really understand how serious things are, and that's a hard thing to do, because to wake up to a dystopic reality and realize that we're in the middle of a giant biological weapons war against humanity, and that there's mass sterilization that's already taking place, cutting off all the major energy sources, is really hard to deal with, but it's the reality.
[02:45:50.455 --> 02:45:52.516]  Facing it is our only chance to turn this around.
[02:45:52.936 --> 02:45:54.636]  This stuff's about to get really, really nasty.
[02:45:55.037 --> 02:45:55.657]  Infowars.com.
[02:45:57.712 --> 02:46:02.335]  29 years on air, all I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalists.
[02:46:03.056 --> 02:46:08.359]  And I've done the best job I can to tell the truth and be accurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[02:46:08.759 --> 02:46:15.204]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves, unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people.
[02:46:15.444 --> 02:46:16.124]  We don't do that.
[02:46:16.584 --> 02:46:18.486]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[02:46:18.846 --> 02:46:20.867]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product.
[02:46:20.927 --> 02:46:21.508]  It's so powerful.
[02:46:22.428 --> 02:46:27.412]  This is the breakdown product after your cells process it of folic acid.
[02:46:27.993 --> 02:46:32.476]  Methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[02:46:32.936 --> 02:46:34.177]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[02:46:34.197 --> 02:46:35.058]  It's not a stimulant.
[02:46:35.318 --> 02:46:37.200]  It energizes your cells.
[02:46:37.700 --> 02:46:40.182]  And that everything else you take just supercharges it.
[02:46:40.242 --> 02:46:41.082]  It's so insane.
[02:46:41.422 --> 02:46:42.943]  It's foundational energy.
[02:46:43.403 --> 02:46:47.526]  The strongest formula out there at infowarsstore.com.
[02:46:47.926 --> 02:46:50.768]  It doesn't just energize this operation against the tyrants.
[02:46:50.868 --> 02:46:51.968]  It energizes you.
[02:46:52.248 --> 02:46:53.709]  Get foundational energy now!
[02:46:59.492 --> 02:47:03.575]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:47:04.115 --> 02:47:05.396]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:29.892 --> 02:47:33.013]  All right, we're taking your calls on the border illegal immigration issue.
[02:47:33.033 --> 02:47:40.577]  We've got the corrupt DA, Fannie Willis, exposing herself, going after Trump.
[02:47:42.958 --> 02:47:48.960]  We've got the issue with Russia and Tucker Carlson going over there and exposing how their cities are nicer than ours.
[02:47:48.980 --> 02:47:49.621]  Well, why is that?
[02:47:49.661 --> 02:47:57.044]  Well, I guess that's because their government isn't filled with psychotic warmonger freaks, even though that's what they would have you believe.
[02:48:00.148 --> 02:48:09.511]  I mean, even if you wanted to claim Russia or Putin were warmongers, compared to the United States leadership, barely even on the radar.
[02:48:10.471 --> 02:48:15.353]  But let's go back to the phone calls, and we go to Matt in California.
[02:48:15.393 --> 02:48:15.953]  Matt, you're on the air.
[02:48:15.973 --> 02:48:16.273]  Go ahead.
[02:48:17.683 --> 02:48:19.104]  Hey, Owen.
[02:48:19.164 --> 02:48:24.709]  Hey, this is also, I just wanted to tell you, Wars of the Info on X, and I've been doing all those drawings of you guys.
[02:48:24.729 --> 02:48:25.590]  I don't know if you've seen them.
[02:48:25.690 --> 02:48:28.693]  I'm trying to draw cartoons of you guys for fun.
[02:48:29.273 --> 02:48:36.139]  But, yeah, dude, like Fanny Willis, I mean, I just, and then will she even go down at all?
[02:48:36.420 --> 02:48:37.641]  I wouldn't get your help, Chuck.
[02:48:37.801 --> 02:48:38.982]  I would not get your help, Chuck.
[02:48:39.022 --> 02:48:40.203]  That's what I mean.
[02:48:40.343 --> 02:48:44.347]  Everybody, one after another, we see another person pop up,
[02:48:44.972 --> 02:48:50.395]  But in the court of public opinion, which is not completely worthless, then she's been completely destroyed.
[02:48:51.456 --> 02:49:07.004]  Yeah, and I just want to know what you think about the upcoming election, of course, and how will we know that there will be some kind of law protected just like it was last time?
[02:49:07.024 --> 02:49:10.406]  I think it's just so sad that I think the same thing
[02:49:12.052 --> 02:49:15.457]  Like all the powers that be, all the world powers against Trump.
[02:49:15.497 --> 02:49:16.018]  You know that.
[02:49:19.036 --> 02:49:19.356]  I don't know.
[02:49:19.617 --> 02:49:24.661]  I mean, I have the same mindset as you, brother.
[02:49:24.801 --> 02:49:27.003]  It's just, you know, I get it.
[02:49:27.183 --> 02:49:27.463]  I get it.
[02:49:27.503 --> 02:49:28.684]  They stole the 2020 election.
[02:49:28.724 --> 02:49:29.805]  They steal midterm elections.
[02:49:29.845 --> 02:49:31.066]  They steal elections left and right.
[02:49:31.406 --> 02:49:31.647]  I know.
[02:49:31.947 --> 02:49:35.870]  Yeah, and then you see the, like all the videos where they expose it all.
[02:49:35.910 --> 02:49:38.152]  Then there's nothing investigated after that.
[02:49:38.172 --> 02:49:39.974]  I mean, I got stories right here.
[02:49:39.994 --> 02:49:41.295]  I got stories right here on this issue.
[02:49:42.488 --> 02:49:46.109]  Atlantic City ballot stuffer reportedly worked for the feds.
[02:49:46.429 --> 02:49:50.330]  Does the FBI have ballot stuffers on the payroll in every major Democrat city?
[02:49:50.350 --> 02:49:51.430]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:49:52.351 --> 02:50:03.554]  FOIA documents reveal secret 2020 election day meeting with CISA, Dominion, ES&S, Eric Voting System, FBI, leftist organizations, states officials, and others just discovered.
[02:50:03.874 --> 02:50:07.895]  So they're all meeting about how they can help our elections.
[02:50:08.895 --> 02:50:10.536]  So, yeah, believe me, I get it.
[02:50:10.856 --> 02:50:11.797]  I get the frustration.
[02:50:14.038 --> 02:50:22.644]  I guess we hope we can overwhelm the voter fraud with real votes.
[02:50:23.164 --> 02:50:24.665]  I mean, I don't know how else to respond.
[02:50:24.685 --> 02:50:28.508]  Look, I don't want to spend too much time on this, Matt, but thank you for the call.
[02:50:28.848 --> 02:50:29.368]  Here's what happens.
[02:50:30.749 --> 02:50:35.092]  In the major Democrat cities, let's just take one example.
[02:50:35.772 --> 02:50:36.313]  Pennsylvania.
[02:50:37.961 --> 02:50:42.882]  Where Trump won, I would say, in 2016, he was winning all day long.
[02:50:42.962 --> 02:50:43.762]  And then what happens?
[02:50:46.883 --> 02:50:59.826]  At 3.30 in the morning in Philadelphia, 350,000 ballots magically arrive, all for Joe Biden, and that's just the perfect number he needed to beat Donald Trump in Pennsylvania.
[02:51:00.486 --> 02:51:03.127]  And then he gets them, and then they say Joe Biden won.
[02:51:05.325 --> 02:51:08.587]  So, it's all concentrated in the major cities.
[02:51:10.088 --> 02:51:13.149]  That's where the voter fraud and the crimes are concentrated.
[02:51:13.710 --> 02:51:16.211]  So, I mean, maybe you can focus on that and stop it.
[02:51:16.311 --> 02:51:20.454]  Maybe you can overwhelm it with the rural vote, but that's what goes on.
[02:51:20.514 --> 02:51:22.255]  Let's go to Happy in Pennsylvania.
[02:51:22.335 --> 02:51:23.335]  We speak of Pennsylvania.
[02:51:23.355 --> 02:51:24.856]  Now, Happy joins us from Pennsylvania.
[02:51:24.896 --> 02:51:25.256]  Go ahead.
[02:51:26.197 --> 02:51:26.957]  Yo, bro, what's good?
[02:51:26.977 --> 02:51:28.438]  It's actually happy, not happy.
[02:51:28.498 --> 02:51:31.120]  But I am happy, to say the least.
[02:51:32.080 --> 02:51:34.742]  But, yeah, I mean, I live in Philadelphia, and I...
[02:51:35.703 --> 02:51:36.804]  I mean, you see it all the time.
[02:51:38.165 --> 02:51:39.286]  It's just so obvious.
[02:51:39.386 --> 02:51:51.495]  And now you have all this propaganda coming out, threatening us into supporting this Ukraine bill, saying there's an imminent Russian threat in space.
[02:51:51.635 --> 02:51:53.416]  I mean, it's just so absurd.
[02:51:54.297 --> 02:51:57.459]  And I just don't know how regular people just don't see that.
[02:51:57.499 --> 02:52:00.982]  It's just such an obvious land grab scheme.
[02:52:01.142 --> 02:52:05.185]  I mean, Ukraine's the poorest country in Europe.
[02:52:05.768 --> 02:52:05.988]  Yeah.
[02:52:06.348 --> 02:52:08.409]  I would say the simplest way to put it...
[02:52:29.145 --> 02:52:32.449]  Is that Israel is a client state of the United States of America.
[02:52:33.150 --> 02:52:38.956]  So the military-industrial complex thrives because of Israel's situation in the Middle East.
[02:52:40.057 --> 02:52:42.240]  And all the individuals in Washington, D.C.
[02:52:42.300 --> 02:52:43.781]  and Northern Virginia that have the
[02:52:44.872 --> 02:52:45.673]  We're good to go.
[02:53:01.414 --> 02:53:02.375]  Explain to me how Israel...
[02:53:29.642 --> 02:53:43.846]  One of the highest GDP per capita in the world needs a no-terms loan, not even a loan, just give them money for this war that's clearly been set up.
[02:53:44.146 --> 02:53:45.186]  Because they own our ass.
[02:53:45.346 --> 02:53:47.367]  Because they own our ass.
[02:53:47.707 --> 02:53:49.987]  Pull it up right now.
[02:53:51.268 --> 02:53:55.209]  In 2018, 19, I forget what it was, Donald Trump said Israel owns our Congress.
[02:53:55.429 --> 02:53:55.829]  He said it.
[02:53:56.857 --> 02:53:57.457]  He said it.
[02:53:57.917 --> 02:53:59.478]  Israel owns our Congress.
[02:53:59.598 --> 02:54:00.578]  Donald Trump in an interview.
[02:54:00.598 --> 02:54:01.778]  Go ahead and pull that up.
[02:54:03.899 --> 02:54:04.439]  I've seen it.
[02:54:04.939 --> 02:54:06.219]  It's so obvious.
[02:54:07.079 --> 02:54:17.722]  But, you know, you have these... But see, it's even worse because you can, I mean, the entire Biden administration are dual state citizens of Israel and the United States.
[02:54:17.982 --> 02:54:20.462]  These are people that are not even elected, Happy.
[02:54:20.522 --> 02:54:21.743]  They're not even, or Pappy, I'm sorry.
[02:54:21.883 --> 02:54:22.783]  They're not even elected.
[02:54:24.824 --> 02:54:34.710]  Well, you see it with Jeffrey Epstein, you see it with all this going on in the intelligence community, and it's just so blatant.
[02:54:34.790 --> 02:54:39.652]  But I'd really like to know, they claim they're serious people.
[02:54:39.733 --> 02:54:41.113]  If they were serious people, why...
[02:54:46.192 --> 02:54:50.355]  Why was Santos thrown out in a matter of minutes?
[02:54:50.616 --> 02:54:59.863]  Oh, yeah, well, no, that's just because... Bob Menendez is so clearly working with foreign government, yet nothing will ever happen to him.
[02:54:59.883 --> 02:55:01.504]  Yeah, nothing happens to Bob Menendez.
[02:55:01.564 --> 02:55:03.265]  Nothing happens to Fat Fanny Willis.
[02:55:03.365 --> 02:55:04.186]  They just get caught.
[02:55:04.867 --> 02:55:06.868]  But George Santos, you know, he's got to go.
[02:55:07.248 --> 02:55:12.172]  I don't know why Republicans like throwing pick sixes in the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl, but they seem to really love it.
[02:55:12.412 --> 02:55:13.413]  That's kind of their legacy.
[02:55:13.433 --> 02:55:13.814]  They'd throw...
[02:55:14.454 --> 02:55:14.634]  Hello?
[02:55:14.654 --> 02:55:15.074]  Yes, sir.
[02:55:15.094 --> 02:55:15.875]  Can you hear me?
[02:55:15.895 --> 02:55:15.955]  Yes.
[02:55:15.975 --> 02:55:16.095]  Hello?
[02:55:16.135 --> 02:55:16.255]  Hello?
[02:55:43.083 --> 02:55:44.765]  All right, let's go to Sean in Texas.
[02:55:44.805 --> 02:55:45.405]  You're on the air.
[02:55:45.445 --> 02:55:46.146]  Sean, go ahead.
[02:55:47.047 --> 02:55:50.290]  Hey, Owen, two quick comments and a prediction I think is important.
[02:55:50.330 --> 02:56:02.200]  First of all, listening to Fannie Willis reminded me... Do you remember that guy from Georgia that was claiming that if we had too much military equipment on Guam, it would capsize?
[02:56:02.261 --> 02:56:04.563]  That's what she reminded me of when she started talking about continents.
[02:56:04.703 --> 02:56:06.905]  And then to the New York police officers...
[02:56:08.115 --> 02:56:10.977]  If you break the law, you're going to be punished.
[02:56:11.017 --> 02:56:13.038]  Well, they broke the law coming in the country.
[02:56:13.078 --> 02:56:14.279]  They're already lawbreakers.
[02:56:14.679 --> 02:56:16.000]  That's right.
[02:56:16.060 --> 02:56:26.025]  And the last thing, and I think this is important, and I haven't heard anybody say this, the only thing that stops the takeover of America is the armed populace.
[02:56:26.666 --> 02:56:29.547]  And I think what they're going to do is they're going to activate the sleeper cells.
[02:56:29.567 --> 02:56:37.732]  You're going to see about a week of hell on Earth, and then the government's going to come out, probably the Biden administration, and say, we have to pick up all of the guns.
[02:56:38.624 --> 02:56:40.713]  From everyone in order to stop it.
[02:56:40.894 --> 02:56:43.223]  I think they're going to use that as a pretext to take the guns.
[02:56:45.011 --> 02:56:47.673]  Well, there's no doubt they want to take all the guns.
[02:56:47.693 --> 02:56:58.262]  They're already trying to pass legislation to ban the Second Amendment, not just to stop your right to own firearms or the right to bear firearms, but they're also trying to stop the right to form a militia.
[02:56:58.302 --> 02:57:03.847]  They have bills that they're trying to pass in Congress right now banning militia groups.
[02:57:04.007 --> 02:57:05.148]  So, yeah, absolutely.
[02:57:05.188 --> 02:57:06.349]  Of course, that's what tyrants want.
[02:57:06.369 --> 02:57:07.710]  They don't want there to be a populace.
[02:57:07.990 --> 02:57:12.294]  They don't want there to be citizen groups that can defend themselves against a tyrannical government.
[02:57:12.634 --> 02:57:13.555]  That's what all tyrants do.
[02:57:13.575 --> 02:57:14.875]  That's what all authoritarians do.
[02:57:14.936 --> 02:57:17.737]  So, of course, that's what they're going to push for in Congress.
[02:57:17.757 --> 02:57:18.518]  But I don't know, Sean.
[02:57:18.538 --> 02:57:23.481]  I think that that might be... They might even know that that's probably taking it too far.
[02:57:23.581 --> 02:57:26.523]  They like to kind of do things cloak and dagger politically.
[02:57:28.186 --> 02:57:33.791]  And if there is some event like that, how are they going to not take the blame when they opened the border wide open?
[02:57:34.392 --> 02:57:39.937]  I don't know how they avoid taking the blame for an event like that when it was them that let all the terrorists in, should that be the case.
[02:57:39.957 --> 02:57:43.360]  Alright, I'm going to do five more minutes, take a couple calls, and then Jay Dyer takes over.
[02:57:48.012 --> 02:57:53.735]  I'm not perfect and I'm under a lot of stress, but if I didn't have the supplements we have, we promote, I wouldn't be able to continue to be on air.
[02:57:54.316 --> 02:58:02.440]  And when you go to InfoWarsStore.com, you are funding the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists in an operation that the enemy admits has been the most effective at exposing them.
[02:58:02.640 --> 02:58:04.201]  Because we're fearless and we don't back down.
[02:58:04.601 --> 02:58:05.582]  We got God on our side.
[02:58:05.882 --> 02:58:07.383]  But God needs to work through you.
[02:58:07.723 --> 02:58:11.745]  You've got to make the decision to get great products you already need at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:58:11.785 --> 02:58:13.026]  And that is a 360 win.
[02:58:13.626 --> 02:58:16.588]  Nitric Boost, without me even knowing, became our number three bestseller.
[02:58:17.268 --> 02:58:18.870]  Because people loved it so much.
[02:58:18.890 --> 02:58:19.831]  They had such great effects.
[02:58:20.131 --> 02:58:26.297]  Got all these natural compounds that clean out the blood, open up your arteries and veins, encapsulators, clean out your heart, your brain, everything.
[02:58:27.118 --> 02:58:28.860]  Well, we got an even better manufacturer.
[02:58:28.880 --> 02:58:33.704]  The other one was great, but one that's even better with even higher quality ingredients at a lower price.
[02:58:34.705 --> 02:58:37.006]  So I could never offer nitric boosts.
[02:58:37.046 --> 02:58:38.586]  It cost us so much to make.
[02:58:39.407 --> 02:58:41.607]  And now we can offer it for 40% off.
[02:58:42.187 --> 02:58:45.949]  Infowarsstore.com, nitric boost, finally back in stock.
[02:58:46.629 --> 02:58:47.569]  40% off out of the gates.
[02:58:47.849 --> 02:58:51.390]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[02:58:51.770 --> 02:58:58.793]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[02:58:58.953 --> 02:59:00.973]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[02:59:01.133 --> 02:59:02.194]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[02:59:02.214 --> 02:59:02.934]  He loved the idea.
[02:59:03.274 --> 02:59:06.779]  What would you call the debate and discussion about a pro-human future?
[02:59:06.819 --> 02:59:07.680]  Just Team Humanity?
[02:59:07.760 --> 02:59:08.641]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[02:59:08.781 --> 02:59:09.222]  Absolutely.
[02:59:09.542 --> 02:59:10.944]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[02:59:11.004 --> 02:59:14.428]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[02:59:14.688 --> 02:59:22.118]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to give InfoWars on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[02:59:22.358 --> 02:59:34.103]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a revolution against the globalists and it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[02:59:34.383 --> 02:59:35.703]  We're told humans are the problem.
[02:59:35.743 --> 02:59:36.724]  We're told we're killing the Earth.
[02:59:37.004 --> 02:59:41.265]  We're told all this garbage so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[02:59:41.586 --> 02:59:42.286]  We're not going to do that.
[02:59:42.526 --> 02:59:47.168]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[02:59:51.027 --> 02:59:54.989]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:59:55.049 --> 02:59:56.570]  You can taste it.
[02:59:58.391 --> 03:00:01.853]  You can see it.
[03:00:02.573 --> 03:00:05.174]  You can face it.
[03:00:18.942 --> 03:00:22.283]  There's a lot of times we have unintentional art here on the show.
[03:00:22.323 --> 03:00:29.064]  And I don't know where the crew found this futuristic, you know, futurism, metropolitan art.
[03:00:31.324 --> 03:00:32.084]  And then music behind it.
[03:00:32.104 --> 03:00:32.765]  You can see it.
[03:00:32.805 --> 03:00:33.385]  You can feel it.
[03:00:34.905 --> 03:00:35.965]  But see, that's what it is.
[03:00:36.085 --> 03:00:36.685]  We can see it.
[03:00:36.725 --> 03:00:37.225]  We can feel it.
[03:00:37.245 --> 03:00:39.066]  We know that this is supposed to be our destiny.
[03:00:39.106 --> 03:00:40.486]  We know that this could be our future.
[03:00:40.526 --> 03:00:41.326]  This could be our now.
[03:00:41.366 --> 03:00:42.786]  And it's all being stolen from us.
[03:00:44.807 --> 03:00:45.847]  It's all being ripped away.
[03:00:47.745 --> 03:00:48.826]  These should be our cities.
[03:00:48.906 --> 03:00:50.166]  These should be our civic centers.
[03:00:50.206 --> 03:00:56.069]  These should be the images of our future humanity on planet Earth.
[03:00:58.390 --> 03:01:03.812]  And yet, here we are, and we have something closer to the decaying city represented in idiocracy.
[03:01:04.172 --> 03:01:05.393]  But this is where you belong.
[03:01:05.693 --> 03:01:06.734]  This is what you can see.
[03:01:06.754 --> 03:01:11.035]  And it's all being stolen from us.
[03:01:13.156 --> 03:01:14.137]  But we're here to take it back.
[03:01:15.708 --> 03:01:17.910]  A couple more calls before Jay Dyer takes over.
[03:01:18.551 --> 03:01:20.332]  We go to Andreas in New York.
[03:01:20.412 --> 03:01:21.273]  Andreas, you're on the air.
[03:01:21.313 --> 03:01:21.674]  Go ahead.
[03:01:22.895 --> 03:01:23.876]  Hey, what's up, brother?
[03:01:23.976 --> 03:01:26.238]  First of all, I just want to say thank you for everything.
[03:01:26.278 --> 03:01:34.246]  I've been watching you since those anti-Trump rallies disguised as pro-woman marches where you used to own everybody over there.
[03:01:34.466 --> 03:01:34.986]  That's right.
[03:01:35.026 --> 03:01:36.027]  That's what they really were.
[03:01:36.067 --> 03:01:37.369]  They don't give a damn about women.
[03:01:38.289 --> 03:01:39.871]  Yeah, it was hilarious watching those.
[03:01:39.911 --> 03:01:40.852]  But I wanted to ask you.
[03:01:41.306 --> 03:01:59.077]  Because I was just learning about a new rule they placed in New York called the 213 rule on quarantines, giving the state health commissions more basically power to enforce quarantines and decide where they would be held just in case that happens.
[03:01:59.097 --> 03:02:00.177]  Do you know anything about that?
[03:02:01.358 --> 03:02:01.658]  No.
[03:02:02.258 --> 03:02:05.760]  I mean, I could have the crew plug it into a search engine here and they can put something on the screen.
[03:02:06.860 --> 03:02:19.606]  I'm not surprised New York would try to do something like that, and I guess they had some trouble quarantining y'all during COVID, and so they have to power grab right now before the new virus used to make you a slave.
[03:02:20.887 --> 03:02:24.829]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure they snuck that in, but that kind of ties into what I wanted to ask.
[03:02:24.869 --> 03:02:28.871]  What do you think the next false flag situation would be before election?
[03:02:28.891 --> 03:02:31.592]  Do you think it's any virus or the...
[03:02:32.185 --> 03:02:33.906]  The sleeper says, what do you think it's going to be?
[03:02:34.206 --> 03:02:35.826]  No, I think it's a big war event.
[03:02:36.406 --> 03:02:37.427]  I've kind of been saying this.
[03:02:37.447 --> 03:02:38.967]  This is a popular question I get asked.
[03:02:39.227 --> 03:02:41.508]  I think it's a major escalation in the war.
[03:02:41.668 --> 03:02:42.428]  That's what I think.
[03:02:42.689 --> 03:02:46.890]  I think it's a dirty bomb or something going off, maybe in the Middle East or Ukraine.
[03:02:48.210 --> 03:02:49.251]  And it's going to be...
[03:02:50.382 --> 03:02:50.562]  Yeah.
[03:03:11.661 --> 03:03:13.942]  I'd say major false flag, major war event.
[03:03:13.962 --> 03:03:15.143]  But there's cyber attacks.
[03:03:15.183 --> 03:03:17.204]  There's, you know, Disease X that they're talking about.
[03:03:17.684 --> 03:03:19.505]  I mean, there could be a weather phenomenon.
[03:03:19.925 --> 03:03:20.445]  So who knows?
[03:03:20.485 --> 03:03:21.265]  It's all on the board.
[03:03:21.866 --> 03:03:22.426]  Thanks for the call.
[03:03:22.446 --> 03:03:25.287]  Let's squeeze in Jay real quick before Jay Dyer takes over.
[03:03:25.447 --> 03:03:26.628]  Jay in Georgia, go ahead.
[03:03:28.048 --> 03:03:28.709]  Hey, Owen.
[03:03:28.729 --> 03:03:29.869]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[03:03:29.889 --> 03:03:30.770]  What's going on, buddy?
[03:03:31.030 --> 03:03:31.290]  Howdy.
[03:03:32.530 --> 03:03:33.011]  Can you hear me?
[03:03:33.551 --> 03:03:33.711]  Yes.
[03:03:34.246 --> 03:03:34.566]  Hello?
[03:03:35.387 --> 03:03:35.887]  Can you hear me?
[03:03:36.667 --> 03:03:36.927]  Man.
[03:03:36.988 --> 03:03:37.388]  Oh, no.
[03:03:37.908 --> 03:03:38.388]  We had him.
[03:03:38.909 --> 03:03:40.089]  He had his chance.
[03:03:40.810 --> 03:03:41.530]  He was right there.
[03:03:41.590 --> 03:03:42.791]  He had it in his hand.
[03:03:42.851 --> 03:03:46.753]  It just... slipped away.
[03:03:48.089 --> 03:03:49.890]  Nonetheless, we're up against the break here anyway.
[03:03:50.370 --> 03:03:51.610]  Jay Dyer's about to take over.
[03:03:51.650 --> 03:03:53.071]  He also has Sam Tripoli with him.
[03:03:53.651 --> 03:03:58.092]  So going to be a fun time with them here on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:03:59.153 --> 03:04:03.674]  And then we're going to have Harrison Smith filling in for me on the InfoWars War Room.
[03:04:03.894 --> 03:04:05.895]  And Alex is working on some things behind the scenes.
[03:04:05.935 --> 03:04:11.937]  And I'll tell you that I happen to be working on some things behind the scenes as well.
[03:04:12.317 --> 03:04:12.818]  Yes.
[03:04:13.218 --> 03:04:13.698]  Excellent.
[03:04:14.474 --> 03:04:19.501]  So we continue to work harder than ever thanks to your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:04:19.781 --> 03:04:22.144]  But I may have to go get a scoop of Turbo Force Plus.
[03:04:22.464 --> 03:04:24.006]  I was drinking the coffee today.
[03:04:24.026 --> 03:04:26.349]  I was drinking the coffee from InfoWarsStore.com today.
[03:04:26.450 --> 03:04:28.512]  When I host the Jones Show, sometimes I'll hit the coffee.
[03:04:29.666 --> 03:04:31.828]  So we have great coffee at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:04:32.128 --> 03:04:33.950]  One great way to support us if you're a coffee drinker.
[03:04:33.990 --> 03:04:40.036]  But I think I might need, for this next project I'm working on to get through the rest of the day, I think I'm going to need some Turbo Force Plus.
[03:04:40.776 --> 03:04:45.220]  Ten hours of clean energy in one scoop of Turbo Force Plus.
[03:04:45.520 --> 03:04:49.124]  40% off right now at InfoWarsStore.com, and it's your support there that keeps us on the air.
[03:04:49.144 --> 03:04:52.567]  All right, short break, and then Jay Dyer takes over with Sam Tripoli.
[03:04:58.450 --> 03:04:59.273]  Winter is coming.
[03:04:59.936 --> 03:05:01.060]  Winter is coming.
[03:05:05.549 --> 03:05:07.029]  Winter is coming.
[03:05:07.350 --> 03:05:08.750]  Winter isn't coming.
[03:05:09.330 --> 03:05:10.631]  Winter is here.
[03:05:11.031 --> 03:05:18.533]  And while the sun isn't helping us produce as much vitamin D, do yourself a favor and try InfoWars Life Winter Sun Plus.

[03:06:03.121 --> 03:06:05.104]  Welcome to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:05.124 --> 03:06:07.106]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[03:06:07.547 --> 03:06:17.499]  And in honor of today's guest, I've worn my Martha Stewart Super Heterosexual Summer Living Line shirt for Sam Tripoli.
[03:06:18.533 --> 03:06:21.756]  And if you don't know Sam Tripoli, then I don't know where you've been.
[03:06:21.816 --> 03:06:24.859]  He's one of the coolest stand-up comedians out there.
[03:06:24.919 --> 03:06:26.260]  He's got multiple podcasts.
[03:06:26.280 --> 03:06:31.265]  He's got more podcasts than he does freaking social media profiles.
[03:06:31.445 --> 03:06:32.266]  I can't even keep up.
[03:06:32.686 --> 03:06:33.887]  I'm trying to find Sam Tripoli.
[03:06:33.907 --> 03:06:35.368]  There's like 50 Sam Tripolis.
[03:06:35.569 --> 03:06:36.910]  Which one's the real you, dude?
[03:06:37.808 --> 03:06:38.809]  Who knows, man?
[03:06:38.849 --> 03:06:40.009]  Who knows, bro?
[03:06:40.049 --> 03:06:41.430]  How are you, Jay Dyer?
[03:06:41.550 --> 03:06:46.613]  Like, Jay, I swear, like, look at your background and how amazing it is.
[03:06:46.793 --> 03:06:52.096]  I attempted that at one point, and my background has been just annihilated by my daughters.
[03:06:52.216 --> 03:06:53.777]  They just, they love books.
[03:06:53.837 --> 03:06:55.017]  They love to chew on my books.
[03:06:55.057 --> 03:07:02.021]  So I get these very deep, deep, sometimes expensive books, and they just gnaw on them like beavers.
[03:07:02.081 --> 03:07:05.123]  So I want to have a background like Jay Dyer.
[03:07:05.243 --> 03:07:07.024]  I'm like, oh, I could do it like this.
[03:07:07.384 --> 03:07:07.724]  We're good to go.
[03:07:31.727 --> 03:07:35.091]  You seem to have one of the best takes when it comes to entertainment.
[03:07:35.131 --> 03:07:36.532]  I mean, you always nail it.
[03:07:36.773 --> 03:07:39.396]  You don't go with the surface level stuff that's going on.
[03:07:39.876 --> 03:07:41.738]  So let's talk about the Taylor Swift psyop first.
[03:07:41.898 --> 03:07:48.245]  Do you think that it is a kind of a psyop that was going on with the soap opera drama with her and Travis?
[03:07:48.265 --> 03:07:49.507]  What's your analysis of all that?
[03:07:50.342 --> 03:07:56.105]  Well, you know what's really crazy about that is like everything that conspiracy theorists said were going to happen literally happened.
[03:07:56.346 --> 03:07:57.927]  Like, it literally happened.
[03:07:58.147 --> 03:08:00.208]  Exactly how we said it was going to happen.
[03:08:00.568 --> 03:08:09.894]  Even to the point where the 49ers made the wrong decision in the overtime to allow Patrick Mahomes to have the ball last, which was not a good idea.
[03:08:10.274 --> 03:08:11.575]  So that even worked out.
[03:08:11.655 --> 03:08:15.457]  Then them coming and making out in the middle of the field after the championship.
[03:08:15.877 --> 03:08:25.703]  That happened, and then the ratings being like 7 million more than any other Super Bowl ever, being the most watched television show of all time.
[03:08:26.063 --> 03:08:28.264]  So, yeah, I do think something's up.
[03:08:28.304 --> 03:08:33.487]  Now, my biggest problem with all this is like, to be honest with you, I mean, Taylor Swift is what Taylor Swift is.
[03:08:34.208 --> 03:08:40.511]  I have two of her songs in my workout plan, like when I really gotta push it, and I'm going for, you know, to put up the 45s on the bench.
[03:08:40.892 --> 03:08:44.214]  I'll put in Bad Blood or something like that, so I'm not gonna lie to you, okay?
[03:08:44.574 --> 03:08:44.814]  But,
[03:08:45.470 --> 03:08:46.390]  Here's the thing, dude.
[03:08:47.551 --> 03:08:50.032]  Everyone knows that sports is bread and circus.
[03:08:50.152 --> 03:08:54.754]  My issue right now with where sports is going is we don't even get to bread and circus anymore.
[03:08:55.055 --> 03:09:02.498]  Now we still get the propaganda going on during that, so we don't even get that break, that kind of smoke screen for what's really going on.
[03:09:02.858 --> 03:09:04.379]  So do I believe...
[03:09:05.169 --> 03:09:10.030]  That the Taylor Swift-Travis Kelsey relationship isn't real 100%.
[03:09:11.370 --> 03:09:15.291]  If you look at his ex-girlfriends, he loves futuristic hot black women.
[03:09:15.351 --> 03:09:17.171]  That tends to be the chicks he's into.
[03:09:17.891 --> 03:09:22.832]  And now he's dating a chick who has the vibe, the sexual energy of a 4x4.
[03:09:22.892 --> 03:09:24.812]  So it is what it is.
[03:09:24.832 --> 03:09:29.633]  I don't have any ill will towards her, but it just sucks that we can't even have these.
[03:09:29.953 --> 03:09:32.534]  I still watch ESPN.
[03:09:32.594 --> 03:09:32.974]  I'm old.
[03:09:33.054 --> 03:09:34.094]  I still watch ESPN.
[03:09:34.694 --> 03:09:37.438]  And, you know, Patrick McAvee's on there, and he's got a great show.
[03:09:37.498 --> 03:09:42.303]  And, you know, he's getting some flack about his ratings.
[03:09:42.404 --> 03:09:43.425]  I think his show's great.
[03:09:43.485 --> 03:09:43.785]  I don't know.
[03:09:44.066 --> 03:09:53.657]  But it's hard to get good ratings when you're forced to talk about, you know, Iowa women's basketball for five minutes, and your whole crew has to act like they're enthralled with this show.
[03:09:53.877 --> 03:09:58.779]  This storyline about this woman spending more money, scoring more points than ever.
[03:09:59.039 --> 03:10:02.820]  And then you follow it with a funny story about out of Houston, C.J.
[03:10:02.840 --> 03:10:05.181]  Stroud making fun of these old NFL players.
[03:10:05.441 --> 03:10:06.841]  And the energy just shifts.
[03:10:07.281 --> 03:10:11.423]  It just totally shifts from what guys really want to hear to what we're forced to hear.
[03:10:11.463 --> 03:10:12.523]  And that's what I'm talking about.
[03:10:12.803 --> 03:10:15.044]  The bread and circus, like, it's just gone.
[03:10:15.444 --> 03:10:22.186]  Now, because we don't watch any of their programming anymore, now they've infiltrated sports and they've ruined that as well.
[03:10:23.880 --> 03:10:24.160]  Yeah.
[03:10:24.520 --> 03:10:32.666]  Did you see the clip where NATO was talking about batting around the idea of using Taylor Swift as a PSYOP disinformation tool?
[03:10:32.706 --> 03:10:34.147]  I don't know if you saw that it was going around.
[03:10:34.167 --> 03:10:35.548]  It was an actual NATO meeting.
[03:10:36.068 --> 03:10:42.012]  And to me, that suggests that, yeah, that, you know, pop stars oftentimes, especially at that mega level...
[03:10:42.672 --> 03:10:48.876]  They can often be co-opted for political purposes beyond even NATO or some kind of PSYOP thing.
[03:10:49.056 --> 03:10:57.081]  We know that famous pop stars in the past, Elvis, people like that, they've been used by the deep state at various levels to push agendas.
[03:10:57.481 --> 03:10:59.962]  I mean, do you think that's out of the realm of possibility here?
[03:11:00.002 --> 03:11:05.245]  We know that at the least she's basically telling everybody to vote for Bobo, Joe Biden, right?
[03:11:05.265 --> 03:11:08.547]  I mean, the DNC usually likes to pull in these pop stars.
[03:11:08.567 --> 03:11:09.308]  What do you think about that?
[03:11:10.513 --> 03:11:10.933]  Oh, 100%.
[03:11:11.614 --> 03:11:14.635]  I mean, like, nothing about Taylor Swift is authentic, right?
[03:11:14.735 --> 03:11:20.098]  Like, even her origin story, her father had to buy the record label to get her on the record label.
[03:11:20.779 --> 03:11:27.682]  And so the whole thing is just, at some point, somebody made a deal with somebody, and they just mega blew her up.
[03:11:27.742 --> 03:11:33.946]  If you look at old Taylor Swift versus new Taylor Swift, it's not the same kind of energy, and I guess we all grow.
[03:11:34.526 --> 03:11:35.627]  We're good to go.
[03:11:52.137 --> 03:12:03.462]  How dark Marilyn Monroe's life really was and how she was basically foster care and then somehow just became, honestly, one of the most powerful people in the world with all the men she was betting.
[03:12:03.522 --> 03:12:05.003]  So that's what they use.
[03:12:05.023 --> 03:12:12.266]  You talk about all the time MKUltra, kittens being used to basically control men.
[03:12:12.306 --> 03:12:19.729]  And if you look at who Marilyn Monroe was hooking up with, it was all of the both the Kennedys,
[03:12:20.389 --> 03:12:24.231]  Frank Sinatra, the head of the mob, and then some Russian spy, and that was the end.
[03:12:24.552 --> 03:12:26.833]  So Taylor Swift is going to be no different than that.
[03:12:26.973 --> 03:12:27.573]  Why would she?
[03:12:27.694 --> 03:12:30.795]  I mean, how big she is isn't authentic.
[03:12:30.895 --> 03:12:31.516]  That's how you know.
[03:12:31.556 --> 03:12:34.397]  To get to that level is not really authentic.
[03:12:34.457 --> 03:12:41.842]  And we saw her with Ice Spice, who's the queen of the downs, and her throwing all the satanic symbolism right there.
[03:12:42.682 --> 03:13:03.896]  It's right there, and I think that's why the commercial with the Jesus and the feet got such a poor reception, because Christians are already in their defense stance, waiting for all the demonic imagery to come at them, and it just ended up making that commercial not be received very well.
[03:13:03.956 --> 03:13:06.338]  So yes, it's all crazy.
[03:13:07.078 --> 03:13:10.841]  Everything we thought was going to happen at this Super Bowl ended up happening.
[03:13:12.645 --> 03:13:14.486]  Yeah, I heard iSpice.
[03:13:15.487 --> 03:13:16.828]  That's the Spice Girls?
[03:13:16.908 --> 03:13:17.368]  Who is this?
[03:13:17.428 --> 03:13:26.554]  I didn't even realize she's a... She's a Ronald McDonald-looking short bus rapper, right?
[03:13:26.574 --> 03:13:30.677]  She looks like Leeloo, like multi-pass, but mixed with Ronald McDonald.
[03:13:31.920 --> 03:13:37.483]  And she just, her whole thing is twerking and showing you her portals, and that's really what she does.
[03:13:38.083 --> 03:13:47.768]  And it's idiocracy times a thousand, and I don't have anything against her as a person, but what she represents is, you know, and we've been talking about this in the conspiracy world forever.
[03:13:48.308 --> 03:13:48.408]  Yeah.
[03:14:08.658 --> 03:14:18.885]  Yeah, I want to talk about Ice Cube and the stories that have come out relating to Diddy, stuff like that, because that's actually really relevant to the control of the entertainment world.
[03:14:20.006 --> 03:14:22.688]  But on that point about Marilyn Monroe, I'm glad you mentioned that.
[03:14:22.828 --> 03:14:32.275]  I did a podcast recently with Sammy the Bull Gravon, the most famous living gangster hitman under John Gotti, and he actually backs up what you said as well, Sam.
[03:14:32.315 --> 03:14:32.655]  He said...
[03:14:33.266 --> 03:14:37.708]  He said, although he wasn't involved in the actual planning, I heard some things.
[03:14:38.449 --> 03:14:39.770]  We had to take care of her.
[03:14:39.830 --> 03:14:40.810]  She might talk.
[03:14:41.891 --> 03:14:49.515]  I mean, yeah, we had to make that decision because she was being used as a kind of honeypot for multiple people.
[03:14:49.555 --> 03:14:54.618]  She was basically a honey thought for like four different groups, the government, the mob, CIA.
[03:14:54.778 --> 03:14:55.758]  Everybody was using her.
[03:14:56.138 --> 03:14:57.139]  And so they had to get rid of her.
[03:14:57.219 --> 03:15:00.981]  So I think you're spot on with Marilyn Monroe there as an example of
[03:15:01.815 --> 03:15:02.876]  I got a question for you, though.
[03:15:03.497 --> 03:15:15.947]  Now, I didn't see this until like a couple days ago, but you got confronted by one of the top Hollywood witches' boyfriend at your comedy event.
[03:15:16.248 --> 03:15:19.851]  Machine Gun Kelly showed up and kind of gave you a little bit of sass.
[03:15:19.891 --> 03:15:21.172]  He got sassy with you.
[03:15:21.212 --> 03:15:24.635]  Now, I'm bringing that up because Megan Fox had that interview with
[03:15:27.652 --> 03:15:35.214]  Not too long ago, it went somewhat viral where she was talking about drinking blood, and this is actually part of her and Machine Gun Kelly's ritual.
[03:15:35.835 --> 03:15:42.457]  So I don't know if you saw that clip, but this seems like something that's actually also going on in the high levels of entertainment.
[03:15:42.537 --> 03:15:51.059]  If you remember back in the day, Alex used to play this clip all the time, of Angelina Jolie and Billy Bob Thornton talking about drinking each other's blood.
[03:15:51.199 --> 03:15:52.820]  So there's actually something to this, too.
[03:15:53.965 --> 03:15:54.566]  Yeah, man.
[03:15:54.706 --> 03:15:57.268]  It's all God versus fallen angels, dude.
[03:15:57.308 --> 03:16:01.172]  And, you know, it's like you and I can have that conversation and people will be like, yeah, it's fine.
[03:16:01.192 --> 03:16:02.053]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[03:16:02.493 --> 03:16:07.118]  But in Hollywood, I might as well just be speaking Chinese with these people.
[03:16:07.738 --> 03:16:10.541]  They have no clue what they're getting into.
[03:16:11.042 --> 03:16:12.043]  And this is the game.
[03:16:12.563 --> 03:16:13.704]  And this is what happens.
[03:16:13.764 --> 03:16:16.327]  And eventually you have to, you know...
[03:16:16.707 --> 03:16:22.070]  Pay your dues, meaning that there's going to come a time where you have to go forward and talk about all the witchcraft that you're into.
[03:16:22.370 --> 03:16:24.952]  You know, Taylor Swift, again, calls her fans witches.
[03:16:25.312 --> 03:16:27.913]  You know, she has a black cube that she's on.
[03:16:28.013 --> 03:16:31.115]  I mean, she has these weird kind of ceremonies on stage.
[03:16:31.455 --> 03:16:39.139]  And it just, it gets down to, you know, Kurt Metzger talked about this in a weird way, too, because I do believe they worship the fallen.
[03:16:39.259 --> 03:16:40.420]  I really do believe at the
[03:16:40.780 --> 03:16:43.503]  Highest levels of power, that is what is worshipped.
[03:16:43.923 --> 03:16:48.547]  If you ask me, based on all my research, fallen angels versus God.
[03:16:48.687 --> 03:16:53.452]  I mean, have you watched these videos, dude, where these chicks, they go from looking like they're like...
[03:16:54.148 --> 03:16:55.428]  We're good to go.
[03:17:15.265 --> 03:17:16.305]  We're good to go.
[03:17:41.235 --> 03:17:41.916]  We're good to go.
[03:18:01.719 --> 03:18:05.323]  To watch their really, really dark stuff.
[03:18:05.403 --> 03:18:07.025]  And it's all dark.
[03:18:07.185 --> 03:18:08.747]  I mean, I don't care what anybody says.
[03:18:09.568 --> 03:18:11.149]  It's just unbelievable to me.
[03:18:11.189 --> 03:18:17.937]  We're in this cultural Marxism movement that is at its deepest roots about dark arts and fallen angels.
[03:18:18.057 --> 03:18:19.359]  And yeah, that's what happens.
[03:18:19.719 --> 03:18:20.520]  I believe in all of it.
[03:18:22.358 --> 03:18:27.800]  Yeah, I was watching a bunch of videos from even Vice Magazine, which is no good.
[03:18:27.880 --> 03:18:32.742]  But they had a guy that they were interviewing from Hollywood.
[03:18:33.422 --> 03:18:38.544]  He works in a lot of high-end hotels, basically the really elite hotels.
[03:18:38.584 --> 03:18:38.844]  And he was...
[03:18:39.444 --> 03:18:39.824]  We're good to go.
[03:18:39.864 --> 03:18:40.224]  We're good to go.
[03:19:07.569 --> 03:19:08.450]  He says rituals.
[03:19:08.610 --> 03:19:10.973]  He says that they're trying to blackmail people.
[03:19:27.253 --> 03:19:27.353]  Yeah.
[03:19:46.579 --> 03:19:57.543]  Well, you know, like I was hanging out in Austin at a comedy club, and a comedian asked me, why is Barack Obama suddenly being out of this game?
[03:19:57.583 --> 03:19:59.644]  I go, it's all a demoralization campaign.
[03:20:00.385 --> 03:20:02.627]  We are in the biggest demoralization campaign.
[03:20:02.947 --> 03:20:04.248]  So what do you do, man?
[03:20:04.308 --> 03:20:05.710]  How do you demoralize somebody?
[03:20:05.730 --> 03:20:07.631]  You position people of power.
[03:20:07.791 --> 03:20:11.975]  You blackmail them through whatever weird kinky sex they're into.
[03:20:12.415 --> 03:20:13.917]  And you use that to control them.
[03:20:14.197 --> 03:20:16.719]  And they, in turn, use that to control others.
[03:20:16.819 --> 03:20:18.640]  I say this all the time.
[03:20:18.701 --> 03:20:27.588]  Pedophilia is the gateway, the ritual to the highest levels of power.
[03:20:27.948 --> 03:20:28.609]  That's how you do it.
[03:20:29.204 --> 03:20:36.111]  You control people through their sexual whatever weird stuff they're into and that's how you get them to do what you want them to do.
[03:20:36.171 --> 03:20:39.694]  So, do I believe that Hollywood is corrupted like that?
[03:20:39.714 --> 03:20:39.694]  100%. 100%.
[03:20:43.280 --> 03:20:51.925]  And they also promote people that they know are shady to eventually out them as shady to demoralize us later on.
[03:20:51.965 --> 03:20:58.570]  When you worship somebody and love them as a fan, and then you find out everything about them was a lie, that is demoralization.
[03:20:58.630 --> 03:20:59.830]  Your anxiety goes up.
[03:21:00.070 --> 03:21:01.211]  Your depression goes up.
[03:21:01.471 --> 03:21:03.032]  So that's the whole game right there.
[03:21:03.172 --> 03:21:08.816]  It is a demoralization campaign like we've probably never seen since the Bolshevik War.
[03:21:10.760 --> 03:21:14.663]  Yeah, you had a good guest on.
[03:21:15.103 --> 03:21:24.569]  You were talking about psyops and massive media psyops and disinformation campaigns and how they really want to demoralize us through all of these public rituals.
[03:21:24.609 --> 03:21:29.552]  I mean, do you think that that's crazy, the idea that the Super Bowl itself is a high-profile ritual?
[03:21:29.572 --> 03:21:39.258]  I know we've talked about that a lot, but it's good to revisit this stuff because it used to be we would get these kind of big satanic slash masonic ceremonies at the Super Bowl with people
[03:21:39.458 --> 03:21:39.578]  Yeah.
[03:21:53.726 --> 03:21:58.469]  No, I mean, if you study Lady Gaga, I think she was either the halftime show.
[03:21:58.809 --> 03:22:00.850]  I mean, I think it was in Dallas Stadium.
[03:22:01.370 --> 03:22:10.255]  She starts off in the heavens, and then she descends down, which is the story of Lucifer, descends down to the lowest levels, and she's surrounded by pentagrams.
[03:22:10.515 --> 03:22:15.578]  And everyone's just like, oh, this is such an entertaining Super Bowl show.
[03:22:15.618 --> 03:22:20.061]  And it's just like, dude, that's the story of Lucifer, like, right there.
[03:22:20.701 --> 03:22:22.862]  And that's what I do because they have the most eyeballs.
[03:22:22.942 --> 03:22:24.423]  It's the best way to affect you.
[03:22:24.463 --> 03:22:27.624]  It's the best way to brainwash you.
[03:22:27.644 --> 03:22:30.445]  And then what they get you to do is just to open up.
[03:22:30.485 --> 03:22:31.025]  Yeah, look at this.
[03:22:31.165 --> 03:22:34.206]  It's the craziest thing I've ever seen.
[03:22:34.286 --> 03:22:35.627]  And you tell Normie that.
[03:22:35.667 --> 03:22:36.587]  And by the way, look at her.
[03:22:36.627 --> 03:22:39.428]  She's got the panda eyes, the famous panda eyes.
[03:22:39.888 --> 03:22:41.149]  She looks like David Bowie's going to descend.
[03:22:41.369 --> 03:22:41.509]  Yeah.
[03:22:44.230 --> 03:23:02.316]  Yeah, and some weird stuff happens there, and then she's going to end up, like, it's the crazy, it gets dark, and then she does this kind of thing where she jumps, and I'm watching this going, this is really weird, and this is when I started going, oh, dude, there's something to this.
[03:23:02.596 --> 03:23:04.277]  And if you study Gaga...
[03:23:05.063 --> 03:23:11.465]  If you understand who Gaga is, Gaga is Pluto, and he is the messenger for Saturn.
[03:23:11.885 --> 03:23:16.886]  And here it is, Lucifer descending from heaven down, down to hell.
[03:23:16.906 --> 03:23:20.627]  Here we go, which looks like some weird itsy-bitsy spider, right?
[03:23:21.047 --> 03:23:21.807]  It's so weird.
[03:23:21.907 --> 03:23:26.088]  And then you start to look around her, and it is nothing but pentagrams.
[03:23:26.588 --> 03:23:33.230]  And then the way that they light the audience, it's all red, looking like flames, and
[03:23:33.860 --> 03:23:51.672]  Listen, man, I grew up, I was one of those people, the generation Xers who saw all the Roman Catholic Church stuff that was with, you know, the priest and the pedophilia and made me disconnect from God, which I think was a giant part.
[03:23:52.489 --> 03:23:52.809]  Mm-hmm.
[03:24:18.826 --> 03:24:18.946]  Yes.
[03:24:18.966 --> 03:24:19.026]  Yes.
[03:24:45.300 --> 03:24:47.602]  So that's why they create satanic panic.
[03:24:47.622 --> 03:24:55.088]  They tell you all this just a bunch of cuckoo crazy Christians going nuts, trying to find a reason to get upset.
[03:24:55.388 --> 03:24:57.390]  In reality, all that stuff was real.
[03:24:57.931 --> 03:24:59.172]  It all really happened.
[03:24:59.572 --> 03:25:07.138]  It was just a giant psyop ran on us so that today they could use that as an excuse not to believe what we're talking about here today.
[03:25:08.880 --> 03:25:09.300]  Yeah, well...
[03:25:10.135 --> 03:25:16.234]  A couple people that really promoted the Satanic Panic were Geraldo and Oprah.
[03:25:17.475 --> 03:25:17.675]  Yeah, 100%.
[03:25:43.710 --> 03:25:52.474]  And, like, dude, I get into this thing where it's like, for me, at the darkest levels, I think it's like Moloch worship and Black Cube.
[03:25:52.875 --> 03:25:53.875]  They might be all the same.
[03:25:53.995 --> 03:25:56.156]  Kronos, that might be the same person.
[03:25:56.676 --> 03:26:00.198]  But they created this thing called Satanism, right?
[03:26:00.838 --> 03:26:08.242]  And Satan exists, but, like, the form of Satanism, which I believe this is pushing, is meant to, like, just get, like,
[03:26:09.002 --> 03:26:21.457]  Goth guys who want to hook up with, you know, fat, you know, like Dungeons and Dragons dudes who just want to hook up with fat goth chicks and just something cool that, you know, that cool down when they go and watch the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
[03:26:21.797 --> 03:26:24.380]  So, like, you look at this guy's eyebrows.
[03:26:24.420 --> 03:26:26.403]  He's obviously a LARP.
[03:26:26.423 --> 03:26:29.026]  And I'm not saying he doesn't participate in it.
[03:26:29.546 --> 03:26:31.789]  Like he obviously did if you know his history.
[03:26:32.149 --> 03:26:39.478]  It's very dark, but it's being presented as this kind of cosplay weirdo thing that will piss off your parents.
[03:26:41.160 --> 03:26:48.808]  But once you start to get into that, you start to see darker and darker and darker, and it gets really bad for you because you're going against God.
[03:26:48.888 --> 03:26:50.130]  And that's my honest belief.
[03:26:52.119 --> 03:27:05.746]  Yeah, in the case of Aquino, I mean, he had quite a few books detailing what to actually do to practice real Satanism, and was involved in quite a few scandals, the Presidio scandal, where he was investigated for abuse.
[03:27:06.306 --> 03:27:11.329]  So, I mean, there was a lot going on beyond just the external costume, large sphere like...
[03:27:12.289 --> 03:27:12.350]  Yes!
[03:27:12.370 --> 03:27:12.570]  Yes!
[03:27:32.091 --> 03:27:33.252]  Bella Lugosi or something.
[03:27:33.272 --> 03:27:34.032]  He looks silly.
[03:27:34.492 --> 03:27:36.393]  Not LeVay, but I'm talking about Aquino.
[03:27:36.413 --> 03:27:37.294]  Yeah.
[03:27:37.654 --> 03:27:39.895]  But, no, they were really engaging in this.
[03:27:39.935 --> 03:27:46.858]  In fact, he was even alleged to have been connected to the Franklin cover-up, the case of, you know, Paul Bonacci, famous...
[03:27:47.678 --> 03:27:49.321]  We're good to go.
[03:28:03.507 --> 03:28:03.627]  Yeah.
[03:28:24.184 --> 03:28:34.071]  I mean, you can look at all the Abrahamic religions, and there seems to be this influx now of dark arts, symbolism.
[03:28:34.251 --> 03:28:40.496]  I mean, whether it's Mecca going around the black cube, the question of the star, David, where does it come from?
[03:28:40.556 --> 03:28:41.817]  What is it actually?
[03:28:41.897 --> 03:28:46.981]  And then everything involved with, you know, I know you're Roman Catholic, and I respect Catholics.
[03:28:47.001 --> 03:28:48.702]  There's something about the Vatican that's just creepy.
[03:28:48.722 --> 03:28:49.482]  I'm not Roman Catholic.
[03:28:49.502 --> 03:28:50.023]  Oh, I thought you were.
[03:28:50.043 --> 03:28:50.483]  I thought you were.
[03:28:50.503 --> 03:28:51.504]  Oh, well, yeah, you're Orthodox.
[03:28:52.224 --> 03:28:52.864]  Hold that thought.
[03:28:52.884 --> 03:28:55.325]  We'll talk about that right when we get back from the break.
[03:28:56.745 --> 03:28:59.306]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalists.
[03:28:59.666 --> 03:29:02.027]  And people can't identify who's a patriot and who isn't.
[03:29:02.347 --> 03:29:05.487]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalists.
[03:29:05.548 --> 03:29:08.468]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.
[03:29:08.708 --> 03:29:19.291]  That's why I designed this amazing 1776 red, white, and blue Gadsden flag shirt so you can support the InfoWar and meet like-minded people everywhere when you wear it.
[03:29:19.411 --> 03:29:19.911]  We're good to go.
[03:29:49.454 --> 03:29:55.279]  Spread the word, meet like-minded people, and fund the 1776 revolution worldwide.
[03:29:57.681 --> 03:30:00.784]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[03:30:00.804 --> 03:30:02.385]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:30:03.126 --> 03:30:06.168]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:30:07.049 --> 03:30:10.993]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers...
[03:30:12.426 --> 03:30:15.129]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:30:15.970 --> 03:30:21.917]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[03:30:22.858 --> 03:30:23.779]  It's really just incredible.
[03:30:24.790 --> 03:30:27.651]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:30:27.671 --> 03:30:33.414]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:30:34.214 --> 03:30:35.114]  I know you spread the word.
[03:30:35.154 --> 03:30:36.635]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[03:30:36.675 --> 03:30:37.195]  Keep doing it.
[03:30:37.255 --> 03:30:43.858]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[03:30:44.298 --> 03:30:45.479]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[03:30:46.199 --> 03:30:49.842]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Enforce.com.
[03:30:50.503 --> 03:30:55.107]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Enforce.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:30:55.427 --> 03:30:56.288]  Please take action now.

[03:33:12.833 --> 03:33:14.434]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:14.474 --> 03:33:16.595]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:33:16.615 --> 03:33:18.316]  We've got Sam Tripoli with us.
[03:33:18.356 --> 03:33:24.999]  He is the host of Broken Simulation, Cash Daddies, Conspiracy Social Club, Ten Full Hats, Zero... I mean...
[03:33:25.695 --> 03:33:27.156]  It just keeps going.
[03:33:27.237 --> 03:33:28.558]  I'm a crazy person.
[03:33:29.218 --> 03:33:30.259]  I'm a crazy person.
[03:33:31.481 --> 03:33:32.722]  Head on over to SamTripley.com.
[03:33:32.742 --> 03:33:34.543]  You can follow him on all the social media outlets.
[03:33:34.563 --> 03:33:39.048]  Sam, I know you've got some dates coming up, stand-up-wise, in terms of Bakersfield.
[03:33:39.068 --> 03:33:40.289]  Do you want to tell us about those dates?
[03:33:41.058 --> 03:33:48.320]  Yes, I'm going to be with the legendary Brian Callen next weekend in Bakersfield and in Huntington Beach.
[03:33:48.360 --> 03:33:54.462]  And then I'm proud to announce my new special, Quiet, is being filmed March 3rd.
[03:33:54.602 --> 03:33:59.304]  That's right, March 3rd at the Bourbon Room in L.A.

[03:34:09.068 --> 03:34:10.309]  I got an hour of power.
[03:34:10.589 --> 03:34:13.691]  And then I just want you, if you get a chance, check out my new Rumble show.
[03:34:14.111 --> 03:34:21.997]  It's called Doomscrolling, and I basically break down the best conspiracy videos from YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram.
[03:34:22.037 --> 03:34:23.498]  So I love doing the show.
[03:34:23.759 --> 03:34:26.280]  We've got some huge numbers, and I'm very blessed.
[03:34:27.822 --> 03:34:30.163]  Am I too serious on this show, Jay?
[03:34:30.764 --> 03:34:31.865]  Am I being too serious?
[03:34:32.605 --> 03:34:33.606]  Am I being too serious?
[03:34:33.626 --> 03:34:35.027]  Should I be wackier?
[03:34:36.914 --> 03:34:42.638]  Well, you are a comedian, so that's up to your professional purview.
[03:34:42.758 --> 03:34:44.520]  You can decide how you want to be.
[03:34:44.860 --> 03:34:47.061]  You can identify as whatever you want to identify as, Sam.
[03:34:47.342 --> 03:34:48.022]  I love that.
[03:34:48.282 --> 03:34:49.023]  I love that.
[03:34:49.283 --> 03:34:50.684]  That's great, dude.
[03:34:51.204 --> 03:34:53.666]  I'm going to identify as successful.
[03:34:53.746 --> 03:34:54.347]  Can I do that?
[03:34:54.367 --> 03:34:55.427]  Am I allowed?
[03:34:55.667 --> 03:34:59.650]  I'm going to identify as Sam Tripoli.
[03:34:59.690 --> 03:35:01.372]  What do you think of that?
[03:35:01.492 --> 03:35:01.732]  Do it.
[03:35:01.832 --> 03:35:02.632]  Good luck with it.
[03:35:02.693 --> 03:35:03.213]  Enjoy it.
[03:35:03.763 --> 03:35:05.684]  It's like when somebody tries to steal your credit.
[03:35:05.744 --> 03:35:07.425]  You're like, oh, dude, you want this credit?
[03:35:07.505 --> 03:35:07.985]  Enjoy it.
[03:35:08.246 --> 03:35:08.446]  Go.
[03:35:09.786 --> 03:35:12.008]  I do impersonate you a lot, though, so I don't know if you know that.
[03:35:12.028 --> 03:35:14.589]  Oh, dude, I've never learned impersonation of me.
[03:35:14.709 --> 03:35:15.750]  Please, can I see it?
[03:35:16.050 --> 03:35:16.730]  Please, God.
[03:35:16.750 --> 03:35:17.231]  I'll do it later.
[03:35:17.251 --> 03:35:17.571]  Give me that.
[03:35:17.591 --> 03:35:18.191]  I'll do it later.
[03:35:18.251 --> 03:35:18.431]  Look.
[03:35:18.671 --> 03:35:18.992]  Okay.
[03:35:19.052 --> 03:35:20.492]  We've got to get back to being serious.
[03:35:20.512 --> 03:35:20.973]  Hold on.
[03:35:23.710 --> 03:35:29.411]  I want to remind everybody that I will be live as well in Hollywood March 15th with the great Jamie Kennedy.
[03:35:29.451 --> 03:35:31.512]  We'll be doing a five-hour event.
[03:35:31.912 --> 03:35:33.992]  Jamie will be the headliner doing some stand-up.
[03:35:34.313 --> 03:35:37.333]  I will be doing a bit of stand-up myself, which is a lot of impressions.
[03:35:37.993 --> 03:35:42.254]  My wife, Jamie Hanshaw, not Kennedy, will be doing a talk on Hollywood occultism.
[03:35:42.334 --> 03:35:45.575]  I'll be doing a talk on geopolitics and conspiracy.
[03:35:45.615 --> 03:35:46.916]  So it's a big five-hour event.
[03:35:46.956 --> 03:35:48.996]  Go get your tickets at the top of my Twitter page.
[03:35:49.588 --> 03:35:50.228]  We're good to go.
[03:36:16.415 --> 03:36:19.758]  Sam accused me of being a pedophile Roman Catholic.
[03:36:20.099 --> 03:36:21.740]  I said, no way, dude.
[03:36:21.820 --> 03:36:23.062]  I forgot, I forgot.
[03:36:24.109 --> 03:36:24.889]  I'm an Orthodox.
[03:36:24.909 --> 03:36:25.430]  That's okay.
[03:36:25.450 --> 03:36:26.430]  That's okay.
[03:36:26.570 --> 03:36:29.411]  We don't believe in the Roman Catholic people stuff, but that's okay.
[03:36:29.571 --> 03:36:32.932]  Look, we've seen the Pope get co-opted.
[03:36:32.972 --> 03:36:38.054]  I mean, the Popes that are basically saying all of Klaus Schwab's lines about the New World Order.
[03:36:38.074 --> 03:36:41.275]  We just had the World Government Summit that met this week.
[03:36:41.295 --> 03:36:43.456]  A couple weeks ago, it was Davos.
[03:36:43.596 --> 03:36:44.376]  Same stuff.
[03:36:44.877 --> 03:36:51.159]  A World Government Summit just has a little bit more of a Muslim Arabic, you know, kebab flavor to it than Davos.
[03:36:51.886 --> 03:37:02.054]  Why are they coming out, Sam, in full, like, just disclosure, telling us everything about, yeah, okay, there's a push for a world government, so what?
[03:37:02.094 --> 03:37:03.255]  If you don't like it, you're a bigot.
[03:37:04.255 --> 03:37:17.986]  Because they've been waiting for this forever, and the time is now, and it could be about something bigger in the universe and calendars and all that stuff, but something is, like, get it out now, let's see if we can control what is happening, and I think
[03:37:18.855 --> 03:37:22.398]  I think what is happening is the most amazing awakening of all time.
[03:37:22.438 --> 03:37:27.463]  And it can get very scary, and it can get very... Like, your anxiety can shoot through the roof.
[03:37:27.663 --> 03:37:37.072]  But I think this is just what you have to go through in order to get to the other side, which is, like, the end of this parasitic, demonic group that's been running...
[03:37:37.912 --> 03:37:42.036]  You know, our world for the last hundreds of years or thousands of years.
[03:37:42.336 --> 03:37:43.237]  And I think it's over.
[03:37:43.297 --> 03:37:51.244]  And I think they know it and they're trying to do whatever they can to control it or to act like they are in control of the change that is coming.
[03:37:51.784 --> 03:37:52.765]  And I think we win.
[03:37:52.805 --> 03:37:53.966]  God wins all the time.
[03:37:54.446 --> 03:37:55.687]  And I think they know it.
[03:37:56.308 --> 03:37:57.369]  People lose hope.
[03:37:59.291 --> 03:38:01.793]  Klaus Schwab may be the most powerful guy in the world.
[03:38:01.853 --> 03:38:02.613]  I don't think he is.
[03:38:02.733 --> 03:38:03.414]  We know his name.
[03:38:03.454 --> 03:38:05.035]  He's probably not the most powerful.
[03:38:05.456 --> 03:38:05.616]  But
[03:38:06.334 --> 03:38:10.076]  You know, even Klaus Schwab is a speck of dirt to the universe.
[03:38:10.376 --> 03:38:12.197]  You're not bigger than the universe.
[03:38:12.237 --> 03:38:13.498]  The universe has rules.
[03:38:13.558 --> 03:38:14.819]  God has laws.
[03:38:15.259 --> 03:38:20.802]  And if you don't follow these laws, you know, the universe starts to bring the hammer down on you.
[03:38:21.362 --> 03:38:23.023]  And Klaus Schwab will get it, too.
[03:38:23.083 --> 03:38:24.084]  They're all going to get it.
[03:38:24.104 --> 03:38:26.285]  Because at the end of the day, it's all about love.
[03:38:26.325 --> 03:38:29.727]  And if you're not giving it away and helping others, you're taking it.
[03:38:29.807 --> 03:38:31.208]  And that's not how the universe works.
[03:38:31.628 --> 03:38:33.209]  So, I have a lot of hope.
[03:38:33.249 --> 03:38:36.310]  I get very nervous about what's coming, but I'm all about chaos.
[03:38:36.690 --> 03:38:37.270]  I love it.
[03:38:37.490 --> 03:38:39.511]  Makes my job easier to talk about it.
[03:38:40.591 --> 03:38:43.252]  You know, it's just, we've been right more than we've been wrong, Jay.
[03:38:43.572 --> 03:38:45.653]  You know, we wouldn't be doing our shows.
[03:38:47.754 --> 03:38:53.776]  We wouldn't be doing this show, you wouldn't be doing this show, you wouldn't be on Alex's channel if you were wrong all the time.
[03:38:54.056 --> 03:38:57.317]  You're way more right than you're wrong, if you're ever wrong.
[03:38:57.657 --> 03:39:00.418]  So that's why you're here, and that's why I think we're winning.
[03:39:02.042 --> 03:39:04.082]  There's a big national security threat event.
[03:39:27.313 --> 03:39:30.315]  And we're all kind of batting around different possibilities.
[03:39:30.415 --> 03:39:31.515]  Is it coup part two?
[03:39:31.595 --> 03:39:34.817]  Is it economic collapse, world war, EMP, fake flag?
[03:39:35.398 --> 03:39:36.458]  What do you think's coming?
[03:39:36.478 --> 03:39:38.819]  You've had a lot of great guests on talking about these topics.
[03:39:38.959 --> 03:39:41.301]  What's the likely scenarios in your mind, Sam?
[03:39:42.561 --> 03:39:47.084]  I think you're going to see some kind of real chaos on soil.
[03:39:48.333 --> 03:39:49.974]  I think that's coming.
[03:40:09.364 --> 03:40:11.524]  And still be able to act like they've won anything.
[03:40:11.564 --> 03:40:15.365]  So they have to control, create maximum chaos, bro!
[03:40:15.465 --> 03:40:26.007]  And that's why I'm taking Krav Maga, Jiu Jitsu, learning to shoot a gun, starting a militia, getting it going, racking and rolling, because, you know, I mean, chaos is coming, dude!
[03:40:26.387 --> 03:40:27.587]  Buckle up, buttercup!
[03:40:27.887 --> 03:40:31.348]  And, you know, I just think people gotta, like, prepare.
[03:40:31.608 --> 03:40:32.028]  That's it.
[03:40:32.168 --> 03:40:33.108]  I mean, something's coming.
[03:40:33.488 --> 03:40:36.529]  And, you know, what we've done to the Middle East
[03:40:37.321 --> 03:40:37.821]  We're good to go.
[03:40:59.514 --> 03:41:01.356]  They start getting concerned with gender wars.
[03:41:01.396 --> 03:41:08.705]  Well, what I would respectfully push back against my friend on that is that that is just a smokescreen.
[03:41:09.312 --> 03:41:22.038]  What's really happening is you start to see the gender stuff when it becomes more and more obvious that the elites are pilfering our natural given laws and wealth and destroying our families.
[03:41:22.058 --> 03:41:31.123]  So once that starts to happen, then they start sending out the trans soldiers and all the antifas and the BLMs.
[03:41:31.483 --> 03:41:37.709]  And all that crazy stuff in our schools so we don't pay attention to the giant looting that is going on at the top.
[03:41:37.929 --> 03:41:42.333]  Because you cannot have a structure if you don't have a base to that structure.
[03:41:42.433 --> 03:41:48.358]  Once the base is weak and the whole structure collapses, and they don't want us to see that, this is a controlled demolition.
[03:41:48.898 --> 03:41:57.206]  Somebody put this out the other day about if Ukraine needs money, why don't they create a Federal Reserve and why don't they just print the money for it?
[03:41:57.666 --> 03:42:07.994]  But they'll never do it because then they can't destroy our monetary system and bring in socialism and ultimately martial law.
[03:42:08.075 --> 03:42:08.855]  That's what they want.
[03:42:08.895 --> 03:42:10.937]  So they have to destroy our dollar to get that going.
[03:42:12.638 --> 03:42:22.766]  Yeah, I mean the only way to bring in the CBDC global currency that they want is to implode the existing system.
[03:42:22.786 --> 03:42:23.267]  We know that
[03:42:23.971 --> 03:42:33.917]  Before COVID, a lot of the high-level people in the medical industry were talking about, we need to blow up the existing system to justify bringing in the new system.
[03:42:33.938 --> 03:42:37.460]  So I kind of think that's what they're doing with the dollar, trying to destroy it.
[03:42:39.141 --> 03:42:43.424]  Maybe the answer is something like Bitcoin that's not centralized.
[03:42:43.604 --> 03:42:45.785]  Any of the centralized cryptos, I think, are dangerous.
[03:42:46.185 --> 03:42:48.027]  You talk about that on Cash Daddies quite a bit.
[03:42:48.067 --> 03:42:49.427]  Look, we're going to go to a break.
[03:42:49.588 --> 03:42:52.910]  I'm with Sam Tripoli, the most woke comedian...
[03:42:53.631 --> 03:42:55.357]  And this is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:55.417 --> 03:42:55.959]  Stay where you are.
[03:42:57.225 --> 03:42:57.845]  I'm not perfect.
[03:42:57.885 --> 03:42:58.685]  I'm under a lot of stress.
[03:42:58.705 --> 03:43:02.946]  But if I didn't have the supplements we have and promote, I wouldn't be able to continue to be on air.
[03:43:03.507 --> 03:43:11.628]  And when you go to Infowarsstore.com, you are funding the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists in an operation that the enemy admits has been the most effective at exposing them.
[03:43:11.849 --> 03:43:13.409]  Because we're fearless and we don't back down.
[03:43:13.809 --> 03:43:14.729]  We got God on our side.
[03:43:15.089 --> 03:43:16.590]  But God needs to work through you.
[03:43:16.930 --> 03:43:20.931]  You've got to make the decision to get great products you already need at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:43:20.991 --> 03:43:22.231]  And that is a 360 win.
[03:43:22.831 --> 03:43:25.792]  Nitric Boost, without me even knowing, became our number three bestseller.
[03:43:26.472 --> 03:43:28.073]  Because people loved it so much.
[03:43:28.093 --> 03:43:29.034]  They had such great effects.
[03:43:29.334 --> 03:43:35.498]  Got all these natural compounds that clean out the blood, open up your arteries and veins, the capillaries, clean out your heart, your brain, everything.
[03:43:36.318 --> 03:43:38.059]  Well, we got an even better manufacturer.
[03:43:38.100 --> 03:43:42.903]  The other one was great, but one that's even better with even higher quality ingredients at a lower price.
[03:43:43.923 --> 03:43:46.325]  So I could never offer nitric boosts.
[03:43:46.345 --> 03:43:47.866]  It cost us so much to make.
[03:43:48.626 --> 03:43:50.847]  And now we can offer it for 40% off.
[03:43:51.388 --> 03:43:54.289]  Infowarsstore.com nitric boosts finally back in stock.
[03:43:54.309 --> 03:43:55.590]  40% off out of the gates.
[03:43:57.935 --> 03:44:00.836]  Have you tried taking the real red pill?
[03:44:01.036 --> 03:44:06.898]  A one-of-a-kind heart and brain formula designed exclusively for InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:44:07.078 --> 03:44:11.760]  One of the most powerful ingredients in the real red pill plus is pregnenolone.
[03:44:11.980 --> 03:44:19.903]  Pregnenolone levels decrease with age, and low levels are associated with fatigue, low brain function, and unhealthy aging.
[03:44:20.123 --> 03:44:28.069]  The Real Red Pill Plus also provides essential trace minerals such as vitamin B12, calcium, copper, and zinc.
[03:44:28.309 --> 03:44:41.239]  Featuring naturally occurring L-theanine, caffeine, and theobromine, the energy blend inside the Real Red Pill Plus provides an extra pick-me-up for your day that goes beyond the second cup of coffee.
[03:44:41.539 --> 03:44:48.425]  So visit InfoWarsStore.com, go down the rabbit hole, and try taking the real red pill.

[03:45:02.638 --> 03:45:07.863]  If you don't spread the word about the broadcast, if you don't share the links, if you don't buy products at InfoWarsStore.com, then...
[03:45:09.301 --> 03:45:10.262]  I'm not griping at you.
[03:45:10.282 --> 03:45:11.403]  I'm just saying, what are you doing?
[03:45:12.483 --> 03:45:15.806]  Less than 1% of you ever buy a product at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:45:16.686 --> 03:45:23.671]  If just a half a percent more would go buy a book or a film or a t-shirt or get some of our great supplements and then reorder them because they really work.
[03:45:23.991 --> 03:45:24.572]  Just try it.
[03:45:25.192 --> 03:45:27.134]  We would be able to do so many things.
[03:45:27.494 --> 03:45:31.257]  I'm praying to God that he'll touch your heart to decide to support us.
[03:45:31.797 --> 03:45:33.598]  InfoWarsStore.com
[03:45:35.768 --> 03:45:36.408]  We're good to go.
[03:45:57.048 --> 03:45:59.291]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[03:45:59.311 --> 03:45:59.832]  Thank you.
[03:46:00.032 --> 03:46:02.576]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[03:46:02.656 --> 03:46:03.918]  I started taking that stuff.
[03:46:03.958 --> 03:46:07.142]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[03:46:07.202 --> 03:46:08.163]  When did you start taking it?
[03:46:08.444 --> 03:46:12.429]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[03:46:12.509 --> 03:46:12.790]  Mm-hmm.
[03:46:13.050 --> 03:46:15.752]  And I started eating a little better, but my blood pressure stayed high.
[03:46:15.772 --> 03:46:23.297]  And when I took the X2 iodine after about three or four weeks, I think my body was detoxified of a bunch of metals and stuff that my body was storing.
[03:46:23.397 --> 03:46:25.599]  And my blood pressure came down to the perfect level.
[03:46:25.999 --> 03:46:28.921]  And I tell people the only thing I did with X2 iodine
[03:46:29.381 --> 03:46:43.250]  And even though I do think all your other products are good, I recommend to anybody that they start with X2 iodine because it detoxifies your body and kind of kicks your natural DNA into full force.
[03:46:43.350 --> 03:46:46.852]  So in my life, I found X2 iodine the best.
[03:46:47.292 --> 03:46:50.734]  I tried other iodines and they didn't have the same effect.
[03:46:51.014 --> 03:46:53.336]  So X2 iodine, I really wanted to point that out.
[03:46:58.297 --> 03:47:04.243]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:04.263 --> 03:47:12.032]  Take the highway to the end.
[03:47:14.605 --> 03:47:20.033]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:20.053 --> 03:47:21.916]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:47:21.936 --> 03:47:24.019]  We're talking with comedian Sam Tripoli.
[03:47:24.119 --> 03:47:25.481]  I was joking when I called him woke.
[03:47:25.501 --> 03:47:27.203]  He's not woke in the bad sense.
[03:47:27.243 --> 03:47:28.325]  He's woke in the good sense.
[03:47:29.246 --> 03:47:30.949]  And we are getting into the topic of
[03:47:32.122 --> 03:47:37.568]  Derailing the election, big false flags, big events in 2024.
[03:47:38.009 --> 03:47:41.433]  Is that the key reason for the big coming event in 2024, Sam?
[03:47:41.493 --> 03:47:49.802]  Do you think it's to do another election derailing like last time and make sure that it's going to be Big Mike?
[03:47:49.983 --> 03:47:51.865]  What do you think is going on with this election?
[03:47:53.170 --> 03:47:55.232]  I mean, they are setting it up.
[03:47:55.292 --> 03:47:56.814]  They are letting you know.
[03:47:57.014 --> 03:48:00.338]  Now they have Jon Stewart openly talking about his age.
[03:48:00.378 --> 03:48:01.258]  He's too old.
[03:48:01.579 --> 03:48:03.581]  He shouldn't be going running.
[03:48:03.941 --> 03:48:04.782]  So they're setting it up.
[03:48:04.842 --> 03:48:06.303]  The question is, who's it going to be?
[03:48:06.324 --> 03:48:08.666]  You know, everyone's talking Big Mike.
[03:48:09.106 --> 03:48:10.608]  Everybody's talking Gavin Newsom.
[03:48:12.140 --> 03:48:15.721]  I mean, nobody's talking Hillary Clinton, who's real quiet, man.
[03:48:15.781 --> 03:48:17.642]  Like, real quiet.
[03:48:18.202 --> 03:48:23.103]  I can see her just slipping out of nowhere to get any kind of, like, bad energy her way.
[03:48:23.143 --> 03:48:26.244]  Just step in at the last second before anyone could do anything.
[03:48:26.304 --> 03:48:27.244]  So, we'll see.
[03:48:27.284 --> 03:48:29.104]  But that's 100% what's going on.
[03:48:29.164 --> 03:48:36.566]  They have to control these five major libertarian, you know, like, libtard...
[03:48:38.147 --> 03:48:42.690]  Cities so they can control the perception that they won.
[03:48:42.710 --> 03:48:47.573]  Because if they lose those cities, there's no way they can lie to us that they won.
[03:48:47.853 --> 03:48:49.675]  They can't rig the election without those cities.
[03:48:49.695 --> 03:48:52.317]  So they have to cause major chaos.
[03:48:52.377 --> 03:48:53.477]  And it's going to happen.
[03:48:53.517 --> 03:49:05.726]  Now, if you've got to take a look at what happened in New York recently, they had an election and they gave New York the decision to choose between a Democrat and someone who's
[03:49:06.366 --> 03:49:10.009]  Obviously, a dual citizen foreigner, okay?
[03:49:10.209 --> 03:49:11.350]  And they picked a Democrat.
[03:49:11.911 --> 03:49:14.633]  That's all they keep voting for are Democrats.
[03:49:15.274 --> 03:49:18.276]  You're talking about Michelle Obama, dual citizen?
[03:49:18.397 --> 03:49:20.178]  She's a man and woman?
[03:49:20.218 --> 03:49:20.578]  No, no, no.
[03:49:20.638 --> 03:49:28.365]  I'm talking about... They recently, I think, had a Senate... George Santos, his seat they gave up.
[03:49:28.425 --> 03:49:32.248]  And by the way, he's killing it on cameos right now.
[03:49:32.609 --> 03:49:32.829]  But...
[03:49:34.270 --> 03:49:34.790]  We're good to go.
[03:49:50.695 --> 03:50:02.360]  The theory of what a Republican could do is worse than what is actually happening on the ground, because most of these liberals are very rich.
[03:50:02.480 --> 03:50:11.083]  They're from an upper level of the financial world, and they are insulated from the results of their voting.
[03:50:12.523 --> 03:50:14.044]  And they'll never stop voting for that.
[03:50:14.325 --> 03:50:20.229]  We'll never save San Francisco or L.A., Chicago, because rich kids keep voting against their father.
[03:50:20.770 --> 03:50:21.510]  Oh, the meanie.
[03:50:21.611 --> 03:50:22.471]  I can't get the meanie.
[03:50:22.491 --> 03:50:35.042]  And even though everyone's getting mugged and everyone's getting robbed and all these stores are closing, they're still going to keep voting Democrat because they can't vote for someone who might, their dad or their grandpa might like, God forbid.
[03:50:37.083 --> 03:50:38.304]  What about my wife, Michael?
[03:50:38.925 --> 03:50:40.366]  Sam, I don't know if you know about my wife, Michael.
[03:50:41.441 --> 03:50:43.302]  I mean, those are some shoulders.
[03:50:44.203 --> 03:50:45.083]  You're the best, bro.
[03:50:45.103 --> 03:50:46.464]  You are the best impersonator.
[03:50:46.944 --> 03:50:50.545]  Yeah, I mean, those are some big shoulders and some fat hands, okay?
[03:50:51.046 --> 03:50:53.147]  Big Mike.
[03:50:53.527 --> 03:50:54.908]  I believe that wholeheartedly.
[03:50:55.228 --> 03:50:59.090]  It's so funny because all we're getting told are that, and I have a lot of trans friends.
[03:50:59.110 --> 03:50:59.770]  I don't care, man.
[03:50:59.810 --> 03:51:00.310]  Live your life.
[03:51:00.350 --> 03:51:01.251]  Just leave kids alone.
[03:51:01.291 --> 03:51:02.051]  That's my whole thing.
[03:51:02.531 --> 03:51:06.213]  And if you study Obamacare,
[03:51:06.883 --> 03:51:15.412]  There were no, like, there were no of these centers to give kids sex changes before Obamacare.
[03:51:15.552 --> 03:51:17.274]  After Obamacare, over a hundred.
[03:51:17.354 --> 03:51:20.197]  So she's going to get all the crap she can get, okay?
[03:51:20.457 --> 03:51:21.078]  I'm sorry.
[03:51:21.098 --> 03:51:22.799]  Like, you brought this in.
[03:51:23.120 --> 03:51:25.422]  Now you're going to feel the consequences of your actions.
[03:51:25.963 --> 03:51:26.083]  And...
[03:51:27.105 --> 03:51:28.886]  You've been telling me trans are unicorns.
[03:51:28.906 --> 03:51:32.487]  Why are you mad that I'm saying that we had a black unicorn in the White House?
[03:51:32.707 --> 03:51:33.807]  You should be celebrating it.
[03:51:33.987 --> 03:51:41.009]  Because the truth is, you really don't think they're normal, and you don't think they're just trying to live their lives.
[03:51:41.469 --> 03:51:44.230]  And secretly, you think they're mentally ill.
[03:51:44.330 --> 03:51:45.671]  And that's why you get upset.
[03:51:45.991 --> 03:51:55.194]  It's like when the old joke was like, oh, you look like, who's the big fat chick that was singing forever?
[03:51:55.654 --> 03:51:56.194]  Vegas Shimmer.
[03:51:57.276 --> 03:51:58.377]  No, no, that's hilarious.
[03:51:58.597 --> 03:52:03.361]  But the big fat chick that was singing, you'd say, oh, you look like her, and chicks would get mad.
[03:52:03.401 --> 03:52:05.183]  Well, you were just telling me she was beautiful.
[03:52:05.223 --> 03:52:06.103]  What are you talking about?
[03:52:06.444 --> 03:52:07.925]  You get to find out the truth about them.
[03:52:08.666 --> 03:52:09.927]  Lizzo, Tessa Holliday.
[03:52:09.947 --> 03:52:12.108]  There we go, Lizzo, dude.
[03:52:12.449 --> 03:52:15.992]  If you're like, oh, you're so beautiful like Lizzo, chicks would lose their mind.
[03:52:16.252 --> 03:52:19.815]  But you're telling me she's beautiful and she should be on the cover of Sports Illustrated.
[03:52:20.095 --> 03:52:21.196]  You know you're full of it.
[03:52:21.456 --> 03:52:22.998]  You're just virtual signaling.
[03:52:23.038 --> 03:52:23.418]  That's it.
[03:52:24.435 --> 03:52:24.856]  Exactly.
[03:52:24.916 --> 03:52:28.642]  Now, you're a California dude, so a lot of people are talking about Gavin Newsom.
[03:52:28.782 --> 03:52:35.873]  It looks like he's had a horrible track record, and he's a communist demon, right?
[03:52:36.855 --> 03:52:37.315]  The worst.
[03:52:37.355 --> 03:52:37.956]  He is the worst.
[03:52:41.542 --> 03:52:42.002]  He's the worst.
[03:52:42.063 --> 03:52:46.466]  I mean, you have Bill Maher trying to call what he did to California dandruff.
[03:52:46.706 --> 03:52:51.630]  That's how detached from reality Bill Maher is.
[03:52:52.351 --> 03:53:00.057]  And so it's like what he did was absolutely destroy generational businesses, family businesses that would be passed down from generation to generation.
[03:53:00.297 --> 03:53:01.558]  We lost a lot of those.
[03:53:02.019 --> 03:53:03.660]  Suicides, drug overdose.
[03:53:04.241 --> 03:53:06.602]  And if you ever watch the...
[03:53:09.204 --> 03:53:14.126]  The documentary Capitalist Conspiracy, they break down exactly what's happening.
[03:53:14.186 --> 03:53:16.167]  It's called Pressure From Above, Pressure From Below.
[03:53:16.628 --> 03:53:21.710]  The reason they released all the criminals is because they want crime to go up.
[03:53:22.190 --> 03:53:26.212]  And the reason they're not doing anything about the crime is because they want to break your spirit.
[03:53:26.592 --> 03:53:30.254]  And that's why they arrest you when you try to defend yourself.
[03:53:30.574 --> 03:53:36.417]  They want you out of options, so you demand that daddy government come and...
[03:53:37.217 --> 03:53:45.929]  steals all your God-given rights and becomes your nanny and can spy on you, enter your house whenever they want, tell you what you can or cannot do.
[03:53:46.209 --> 03:53:47.711]  And that is the goal of everything.
[03:53:47.912 --> 03:53:50.475]  And Gavin Newsom is pushing that agenda forward.
[03:53:52.125 --> 03:53:52.765]  Yeah, I remember.
[03:53:52.825 --> 03:54:01.490]  I mean, I've been coming to California at least once a year the last four or five years, and I've noticed a steady decline, especially pre- and post-COVID, right?
[03:54:01.530 --> 03:54:03.671]  I mean, it's like pretty rough.
[03:54:04.091 --> 03:54:05.172]  I mean, it's pretty rough.
[03:54:05.272 --> 03:54:08.514]  I mean, not everywhere, but a lot of places are pretty bad.
[03:54:08.574 --> 03:54:13.777]  And I always see California as kind of like it's a military industrial complex test bed.
[03:54:13.837 --> 03:54:17.259]  It's like a test tube for the rest of the country 20 or 30 years later.
[03:54:17.279 --> 03:54:17.439]  Yeah.
[03:54:17.459 --> 03:54:17.599]  Yeah.
[03:54:20.773 --> 03:54:27.317]  And basically what happened, it used to be California would set the trends and it would slowly move itself to the middle of the country.
[03:54:27.377 --> 03:54:31.080]  New York and California would push out all the new cool stuff.
[03:54:31.140 --> 03:54:33.341]  And now all the outlaws have left L.A.
[03:54:33.501 --> 03:54:34.242]  All the outlaws.
[03:54:34.602 --> 03:54:35.823]  There's no outlaws left.
[03:54:36.083 --> 03:54:36.723]  Me, maybe.
[03:54:36.823 --> 03:54:37.264]  That's it.
[03:54:37.824 --> 03:54:40.246]  Everybody else has moved to Texas or Florida.
[03:54:40.646 --> 03:54:46.850]  And what you have here is just a bunch of rich kids who just don't want to come off as anything other than woke.
[03:54:48.271 --> 03:54:50.513]  I don't know how we're going to save LA.
[03:54:50.553 --> 03:55:00.520]  I don't know how we're going to save San Francisco when you only have rich kids who are voting all the time and they just cannot not vote for the party that's put them in this situation.
[03:55:02.521 --> 03:55:02.882]  You, uh...
[03:55:03.891 --> 03:55:06.292]  We've got a few minutes left here as we close it out.
[03:55:07.453 --> 03:55:09.393]  You were on Rogan again not too long ago.
[03:55:09.413 --> 03:55:11.374]  A few months back you were back on Rogan.
[03:55:12.675 --> 03:55:14.335]  That must have been pretty wild.
[03:55:14.355 --> 03:55:15.456]  That's a huge audience.
[03:55:15.476 --> 03:55:17.097]  I know you got some good exposure from that.
[03:55:17.117 --> 03:55:18.037]  Did you have a good conversation?
[03:55:19.207 --> 03:55:21.128]  I always have good conversations with Rogan.
[03:55:21.728 --> 03:55:23.549]  It's almost too good a conversation.
[03:55:23.629 --> 03:55:28.671]  Back in the day, I would like to go too deep, and I feel like I got a little weird there.
[03:55:29.152 --> 03:55:32.393]  But Joe Rogan, I love him.
[03:55:33.033 --> 03:55:33.954]  He's a good friend of mine.
[03:55:33.974 --> 03:55:45.359]  I've watched him go from this guy who was doing Fear Factor to having this great, incredible podcast that is helping get information out to everybody.
[03:55:45.419 --> 03:55:47.200]  And I know the man, and he's a great man.
[03:55:47.940 --> 03:55:49.041]  It's a blessing.
[03:55:49.661 --> 03:55:57.506]  What's really crazy is when you see people clip up that interview and everyone's like, dude, this guy called this, this guy called that.
[03:55:57.627 --> 03:55:59.388]  It's great.
[03:55:59.488 --> 03:56:00.789]  It's a blessing to be on there.
[03:56:00.809 --> 03:56:02.169]  I love it.
[03:56:02.209 --> 03:56:03.270]  I love talking to them.
[03:56:03.310 --> 03:56:04.571]  I love everybody in Austin.
[03:56:04.591 --> 03:56:06.812]  I wish I was out there with them because that's my whole crew.
[03:56:07.073 --> 03:56:08.373]  They're all gone from LA.
[03:56:08.574 --> 03:56:09.894]  It's a blessing.
[03:56:11.155 --> 03:56:12.216]  You called the chaos.
[03:56:12.236 --> 03:56:15.238]  Do you remember what other highlights you called in that interview?
[03:56:15.258 --> 03:56:15.338]  Yeah.
[03:56:16.411 --> 03:56:25.178]  Well, you know, he's been doing a lot of stuff on Antarctica right now, and I think I've been really, I got into a lot of spirituality struggle that is going on right now.
[03:56:25.298 --> 03:56:32.244]  And, like, my whole thing is, like, if they can print up all the money, all right, they have all the power, why are they doing any of this?
[03:56:32.244 --> 03:56:32.424]  Of you?
[03:56:32.444 --> 03:56:32.544]  Yeah.
[03:56:32.664 --> 03:56:36.646]  I'll do that if you have me on your podcast when I come out there March 15th.
[03:57:00.422 --> 03:57:04.068]  I'll do a whole Sam Tripoli rant for you.
[03:57:04.149 --> 03:57:05.331]  No, I've got to have something to save.
[03:57:07.469 --> 03:57:08.710]  You're always open, man.
[03:57:08.750 --> 03:57:10.491]  You're always open to come on the show.
[03:57:10.651 --> 03:57:11.071]  I love it.
[03:57:11.651 --> 03:57:14.173]  Sometimes when I start talking about this, I get too serious.
[03:57:14.693 --> 03:57:16.634]  But I just love coming on your show.
[03:57:16.654 --> 03:57:23.838]  I loved watching you just start become, you know, everyone learn about you and, you know, see your exposure getting bigger and bigger.
[03:57:23.898 --> 03:57:27.399]  And the fact that you're on Alex's, you know, channel is so amazing.
[03:57:27.419 --> 03:57:29.020]  And I love everybody at Infowars.
[03:57:29.060 --> 03:57:30.201]  So thanks for having me on, guys.
[03:57:31.176 --> 03:57:31.976]  Unbelievable.
[03:57:32.036 --> 03:57:32.757]  It is Sunday, 2005.
[03:57:32.857 --> 03:57:35.458]  We're going to be live for the next seven hours.
[03:57:35.518 --> 03:57:35.798]  Thank you.
[03:57:35.818 --> 03:57:36.778]  I had to throw in Alex Jones.
[03:57:36.858 --> 03:57:39.960]  It is Sam Tripoli with me on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:40.000 --> 03:57:41.040]  Go to samtripoli.com.
[03:57:41.080 --> 03:57:44.962]  Go follow him on all the social media outlets and support the InfoWars store.
[03:57:46.820 --> 03:57:51.102]  99 years on air, all I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalists.
[03:57:51.802 --> 03:57:57.124]  And I've done the best job I can to tell the truth and the inaccurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[03:57:57.524 --> 03:58:00.085]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves.
[03:58:00.485 --> 03:58:04.886]  Unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people, we don't do that.
[03:58:05.346 --> 03:58:07.247]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[03:58:07.607 --> 03:58:09.628]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product.
[03:58:09.688 --> 03:58:10.248]  It's so powerful.
[03:58:11.188 --> 03:58:21.232]  This is the breakdown product after your cells process it of folic acid, methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[03:58:21.692 --> 03:58:22.933]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[03:58:22.973 --> 03:58:23.833]  It's not a stimulant.
[03:58:24.093 --> 03:58:25.894]  It energizes your cells.
[03:58:26.454 --> 03:58:30.237]  It doesn't just energize this operation against the tyrants, it energizes you.
[03:58:30.257 --> 03:58:31.738]  Get foundational energy now!
[03:58:46.903 --> 03:58:52.366]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[03:58:53.126 --> 03:58:57.408]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[03:58:57.808 --> 03:59:02.170]  We finally have a limited run back in supply at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:59:03.611 --> 03:59:06.373]  So many people have serious issues.
[03:59:06.673 --> 03:59:07.794]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[03:59:08.234 --> 03:59:13.638]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[03:59:14.178 --> 03:59:19.581]  Most of the other iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[03:59:20.222 --> 03:59:23.124]  But this is pure atomic certified iodine.
[03:59:25.796 --> 03:59:28.878]  X2 is now back in stock, discounted.
[03:59:29.198 --> 03:59:32.400]  So I'm giving Thanksgiving right now for this product being here.
[03:59:32.740 --> 03:59:37.843]  It funds the InfoWar, but I guarantee you, you take this for a few weeks, you will feel the difference.
[03:59:38.003 --> 03:59:38.804]  It is amazing.
[03:59:39.124 --> 03:59:45.128]  It's the missing link, X2, back in stock at the end of 2023 at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:59:45.548 --> 03:59:45.948]  X2.
[03:59:47.749 --> 03:59:53.653]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
