[00:00:16.908 --> 00:00:21.130]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:30.835]  Ladies and gentlemen, we got big news coming up.
[00:00:30.895 --> 00:00:32.896]  We have incredible footage
[00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:59.539]  of the illegal immigrant caravans making their way across the United States and now showing up by the hundreds at major bus stations, specifically in New York City, showing up dazed and confused, not even knowing what's going on, just implanted there, told they can get free crap, go to the Roosevelt Hotel, you're taken care of for 30 days, all on the taxpayer dot.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.940]  But first,
[00:01:02.165 --> 00:01:05.604]  This special message from OJ Simpson.
[00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:10.510]  Hey, Twitter World, it's me, yours truly.
[00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.512]  I heard something really interesting today.
[00:01:13.552 --> 00:01:27.060]  You know, with 99 or whatever percent of people dying or the unvaccinated from the new COVID stuff, over 90% of hospitalizations, especially in Florida, are among the unvaccinated.
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.141]  A female doctor was on this morning.
[00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:30.722]  She made the best analogy I've heard.
[00:01:30.782 --> 00:01:34.504]  She said that being vaccinated is like wearing your seatbelt.
[00:01:35.925 --> 00:01:43.767]  That it doesn't guarantee you won't get in an accident, but if you do, you have a much better chance of surviving.
[00:01:44.147 --> 00:01:46.467]  Hey, get your shots!
[00:01:46.707 --> 00:01:52.848]  I don't like wearing masks, and it's you people who aren't getting the shots that have brought this mask thing back.
[00:01:53.528 --> 00:01:54.209]  I'm just saying.
[00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:55.049]  Take care.
[00:01:56.809 --> 00:02:00.910]  Well, first of all, everything that OJ Simpson, now the late,
[00:02:01.832 --> 00:02:02.172]  O.J.
[00:02:02.212 --> 00:02:05.893]  Simpson dies today, 76, from cancer.
[00:02:07.134 --> 00:02:10.175]  Everything he says there in that video, of course, is inaccurate.
[00:02:10.315 --> 00:02:12.496]  It wasn't the unvaccinated that were filling the hospitals.
[00:02:12.556 --> 00:02:13.316]  It was the vaccinated.
[00:02:13.416 --> 00:02:14.296]  That's the real data.
[00:02:15.217 --> 00:02:19.998]  It wasn't really the vaccinated or the unvaccinated forcing us to wear masks.
[00:02:20.058 --> 00:02:27.061]  That was government policy lunacy from Anthony Fauci, who admitted they did nothing.
[00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:32.847]  And then crazed lunatics who just want to tell you what to do with a mask on your face.
[00:02:32.887 --> 00:02:35.288]  But today, O.J.
[00:02:35.348 --> 00:02:38.669]  Simpson dies from a battle with cancer.
[00:02:42.411 --> 00:02:47.873]  And of course, you'd have to assume that he took the vaccine.
[00:02:49.053 --> 00:02:50.314]  Now it's very likely O.J.
[00:02:50.334 --> 00:02:51.054]  could have been paid
[00:02:52.281 --> 00:03:01.745]  We know that the government and these health care bureaucracies were paying people to promote COVID propaganda and to promote the vaccines.
[00:03:01.785 --> 00:03:02.385]  That came out.
[00:03:02.646 --> 00:03:08.268]  Major influencers on their Instagram and TikToks came out and said, hey, I was given these offers.
[00:03:08.328 --> 00:03:11.209]  I just had to come on here and promote the vaccine and I'd get paid.
[00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:18.072]  So was OJ Simpson paid to promote that?
[00:03:18.112 --> 00:03:19.193]  Did OJ Simpson take
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:26.383]  The vaccine, did that then lead to him getting a turbo cancer which then killed him just a few short years later?
[00:03:28.203 --> 00:03:30.444]  We're all asking the same thing.
[00:03:34.646 --> 00:03:41.789]  But I'm sure it's just a coincidence that all these people that said, hey, get the vaccine, I'm taking the vaccine, I took my booster, and then they get cancer.
[00:03:42.864 --> 00:03:44.424]  I'm sure that's just a coincidence.
[00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:49.106]  I'm sure it's just a coincidence now that every individual that got the vaccine ends up getting COVID.
[00:03:49.466 --> 00:03:51.146]  Many of them back in the hospital.
[00:03:51.767 --> 00:03:55.688]  Meanwhile, the unvaccinated are not getting cancer, are not getting COVID.
[00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.510]  So, this isn't to mock the dead here.
[00:04:05.631 --> 00:04:10.292]  And the story of OJ Simpson is obviously infamous in its own right.
[00:04:12.307 --> 00:04:25.071]  This is to highlight the continuation of the reality playing out that the COVID-19 vaccines are killing people, giving people turbo cancers, giving people heart disease.
[00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:26.951]  They knew it the entire time.
[00:04:29.012 --> 00:04:36.014]  And OJ Simpson might just be the last, the last example that we have, not the final, but the most recent.
[00:04:40.885 --> 00:04:43.687]  Seemed awfully healthy when he was shooting that video telling you to get your shot.
[00:04:44.708 --> 00:04:47.570]  Blaming everything on the unvaccinated, like he was probably told to do.
[00:04:50.092 --> 00:04:51.894]  So we don't mock the dead, we don't celebrate that.
[00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:58.098]  But, it's just more evidence that these vaccines are killing people left and right, folks.
[00:04:58.138 --> 00:04:58.959]  They mandated it.
[00:05:00.658 --> 00:05:03.200]  It's been sold out for six months.
[00:05:03.861 --> 00:05:05.342]  It's our number two bestseller.
[00:05:05.462 --> 00:05:06.402]  It's X3.
[00:05:07.023 --> 00:05:13.308]  The highest quality, pure, deep earth crystal iodine you're going to find anywhere.
[00:05:13.328 --> 00:05:16.850]  With the two other types of iodine that are great for your body as well.
[00:05:17.251 --> 00:05:21.854]  So to make sure no matter what type of body type you have, whatever your physiology is, it will supercharge you.
[00:05:22.215 --> 00:05:23.476]  Look at this giant stack right here.
[00:05:24.096 --> 00:05:26.817]  I can talk for hours about this on air, and I'm planning to next week.
[00:05:27.558 --> 00:05:32.940]  But the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[00:05:33.301 --> 00:05:34.821]  And all iodine is not created equal.
[00:05:35.142 --> 00:05:40.364]  Most iodine is bound to other things in the environment, whether it's plants or animals you're eating, so you don't absorb it.
[00:05:40.664 --> 00:05:41.305]  This is pure.
[00:05:41.325 --> 00:05:42.285]  It goes right into your cells.
[00:05:42.785 --> 00:05:45.147]  It is essential for all electrochemical activity.
[00:05:45.567 --> 00:05:49.789]  And despite the fact it's been sold out for six months, X3 is back in stock.
[00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:54.011]  We're 40% off for a limited time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:05:54.371 --> 00:05:59.273]  So stock up on X3 right now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:06:08.037 --> 00:06:08.997]  You found it.
[00:06:09.317 --> 00:06:10.718]  The tip of the spear.
[00:06:10.738 --> 00:06:15.840]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[00:06:20.236 --> 00:06:21.977]  All right, we're absolutely loaded today.
[00:06:24.418 --> 00:06:25.999]  We're absolutely loaded today.
[00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:42.589]  A part two comes out from Sound Investigations, where that O-penis, O-benus, O-blenus, O-benus, O-blenus, talking about, oh, we set up Alex Jones, we made sure to take his money, cut his legs off.
[00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.751]  Well, now there's a part two, and
[00:06:49.008 --> 00:06:57.492]  Now he's talking about how Ukraine is basically a deep state operation run by the CIA.
[00:07:00.234 --> 00:07:01.754]  So I'm going to get more into that.
[00:07:05.136 --> 00:07:06.577]  It's just insane, honestly.
[00:07:07.117 --> 00:07:14.401]  I can't even wrap my head around how absolutely bat-crap crazy the American left is going.
[00:07:15.655 --> 00:07:24.581]  And that's one example with that guy bragging about whatever involvement he does or doesn't have in the CIA eating hamburger lettuce.
[00:07:26.082 --> 00:07:27.383]  Just hamburger lettuce, that's it.
[00:07:27.423 --> 00:07:30.966]  He just eats hamburger lettuce.
[00:07:30.986 --> 00:07:33.907]  Probably a rule of thumb, don't trust anybody that just eats hamburger lettuce.
[00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.252]  And you've got that going on, you've got
[00:07:42.316 --> 00:07:55.764]  All these different left-wing ad firms now convincing these companies that, oh, you need to market to trans kids and you need to market to, hold on, let me make sure I read this correctly for you.
[00:07:57.666 --> 00:08:01.248]  LGBTQIAASP2+.
[00:08:03.729 --> 00:08:04.370]  You get all that?
[00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:09.272]  That was a bit of a... Here, let's give it again.
[00:08:09.972 --> 00:08:14.954]  L-G-B-T-Q-I-A-A-S-P-2-PLUS!
[00:08:21.417 --> 00:08:34.942]  So these big left-wing ad firms, and they get the Dylan Mulvaney's and they convince Bud Light and all these other companies, you need to market to trans kids, you need to market to the trans folk, and the L-G-B-T-Q-I-A-S-P-2-PLUS!
[00:08:36.128 --> 00:08:36.288]  What?
[00:08:36.408 --> 00:08:38.649]  Oh my gosh, wow, that's advanced.
[00:08:39.729 --> 00:08:40.669]  Oh my, oh, whoa.
[00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:41.929]  That's advanced algebra.
[00:08:41.949 --> 00:08:42.949]  Maybe they're onto something here.
[00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.490]  Oh, it's advanced algebra, alright, buddy.
[00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:47.250]  You just can't understand it.
[00:08:50.011 --> 00:08:53.312]  And then you have Lori Lightfoot, the disgraced mayor of Chicago.
[00:08:53.472 --> 00:08:59.273]  She's going to be investigating Tiffany Henyard, the next disgraced mayor of a town outside of Chicago.
[00:09:00.393 --> 00:09:02.133]  And she's going to be getting paid $400 an hour to cover it up!
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.383]  I mean, this is just insane.
[00:09:10.344 --> 00:09:19.872]  Joe Biden, and he comes out and says, he's like, yeah, basically it's totally illegal for us to forgive the student debt, but we're going to do it anyway.
[00:09:20.513 --> 00:09:21.153]  What a lie.
[00:09:21.213 --> 00:09:23.435]  There is no such thing as canceling student debt.
[00:09:25.037 --> 00:09:27.078]  There is no such thing as forgiving student debt.
[00:09:27.239 --> 00:09:28.300]  Somebody's paying that debt.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.901]  Just not the person that took out the loan.
[00:09:32.201 --> 00:09:35.301]  Just not the person that signed their name that they would pay off the debt.
[00:09:35.802 --> 00:09:36.942]  You're paying off the debt.
[00:09:38.322 --> 00:09:38.542]  See?
[00:09:40.723 --> 00:09:41.343]  And they just lie.
[00:09:41.363 --> 00:09:42.503]  They say, oh, it's cancellation.
[00:09:42.563 --> 00:09:43.003]  Isn't it great?
[00:09:43.023 --> 00:09:43.723]  We're cancelling the debt.
[00:09:43.743 --> 00:09:44.784]  You're not cancelling any debt.
[00:09:44.904 --> 00:09:45.404]  You're lying.
[00:09:45.844 --> 00:09:46.984]  Someone else is paying that debt.
[00:09:48.745 --> 00:09:49.845]  You're just trying to buy votes.
[00:09:53.365 --> 00:09:53.665]  U.S.
[00:09:53.725 --> 00:09:57.128]  Navy deletes photo of ship commander shooting rifle with backwards scope.
[00:09:57.148 --> 00:09:58.269]  It was an official Navy ad.
[00:09:58.309 --> 00:09:58.849]  They put it up.
[00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:00.691]  Promoted it on their social media.
[00:10:00.711 --> 00:10:01.792]  They had the scope on the wrong way.
[00:10:06.416 --> 00:10:06.756]  Oh yeah.
[00:10:07.576 --> 00:10:07.857]  Remember?
[00:10:08.697 --> 00:10:16.323]  Remember this is the same American left that thinks islands float and might capsize if the weight isn't equally distributed?
[00:10:17.424 --> 00:10:17.544]  Yeah.
[00:10:18.396 --> 00:10:23.277]  This is the same Democrat Party leadership that thinks the moon is made of gas?
[00:10:24.797 --> 00:10:26.858]  And you can kind of get kind of close to the sun.
[00:10:26.898 --> 00:10:27.538]  It's not impossible.
[00:10:27.558 --> 00:10:30.579]  You can get kind of close to the sun, says Sheila Jackson Lee.
[00:10:34.239 --> 00:10:34.699]  Same people.
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.540]  Same people that told you to get a vaccine.
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:42.081]  OJ Simpson promotes the vaccine, dies of cancer a few years later.
[00:10:47.443 --> 00:10:57.109]  And the same people that have the open southern border policy, which is getting completely out of control.
[00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:04.433]  And at this point, even Governor Abbott is part of the problem.
[00:11:05.974 --> 00:11:06.994]  And yeah, you know what?
[00:11:07.595 --> 00:11:16.240]  His policy that started a few months ago, actually stopping the illegals from getting in or trying to deter them to go to other states, that has worked to an extent.
[00:11:17.056 --> 00:11:28.721]  It's three years too late, but it has worked to an extent, but it hasn't really accomplished the goal, which is to stop the illegal immigrants, because now they just go to Arizona, New Mexico, or California.
[00:11:28.741 --> 00:11:35.183]  So they're still getting in, the numbers haven't gone down, just they've gone down in Texas, but not overall.
[00:11:37.184 --> 00:11:41.246]  And then there's this video today, bus loads.
[00:11:42.086 --> 00:11:45.468]  What you're seeing on the screen here, bus loads,
[00:11:46.624 --> 00:11:48.665]  Hundreds, thousands, I mean try to count them.
[00:11:49.826 --> 00:12:01.433]  It's like a New York Knicks game just got let out at Penn Station, train station, in New York City.
[00:12:01.494 --> 00:12:02.114]  Shock video.
[00:12:02.454 --> 00:12:05.296]  Hundreds of illegals flood Penn Station in New York City.
[00:12:05.336 --> 00:12:10.619]  Large crowd of illegal immigrants guided through New York City transit hub by police and activists.
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:16.063]  Migrants covered in gang tattoos seen amongst the new arrivals.
[00:12:18.846 --> 00:12:23.367]  And it's of all different backgrounds, from all different countries.
[00:12:23.407 --> 00:12:24.368]  You've got children.
[00:12:26.708 --> 00:12:36.592]  Footage shot by journalists with Viral News New York City shows a massive crowd of illegal immigrants making their way through the transit hub under the guidance of activists and New York Police officers on Tuesday.
[00:12:38.192 --> 00:12:47.135]  They are believed, and this is the problem, from Viral News New York City, they are believed to have come from Texas
[00:12:48.186 --> 00:12:55.650]  And they went from Texas to New Jersey to New York City, where they were placed in cabs and taken to the Roosevelt Migrant Intake Center.
[00:12:55.690 --> 00:13:16.262]  So, I guess the theory is that their trip goes from Texas to New Jersey, New Jersey to New York City at the Penn Station, final drop-off, and then they can get in cabs and all those other things, whatever ride service, and then there you have them arriving at their final destination, five-star hotels, downtown New York City, going for $300, $400 a night.
[00:13:20.476 --> 00:13:22.637]  I guess the hotel owners love it, right?
[00:13:22.697 --> 00:13:25.839]  Because now you don't have to worry about vacancies.
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:33.484]  The government has just bought your entire hotel out for the illegal immigrants, so you don't even have to worry about the vacancies.
[00:13:33.965 --> 00:13:35.566]  And you're making more money than ever before.
[00:13:35.986 --> 00:13:42.890]  Plus, they're paying extra help for security and other things that the illegal immigrants need, so your staff has a lot of the burden removed as well.
[00:13:44.631 --> 00:13:44.932]  Who knows?
[00:13:44.952 --> 00:13:46.773]  You might even be able to cut some staff loose!
[00:13:47.998 --> 00:13:50.018]  So you're just loving it if you're these hotel owners.
[00:13:51.439 --> 00:13:52.599]  Are you betraying your country?
[00:13:52.679 --> 00:13:52.859]  Well.
[00:13:53.079 --> 00:13:54.599]  Are you aiding and abetting in a crime?
[00:13:54.619 --> 00:13:54.859]  Well.
[00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:57.920]  We're not worried about that.
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:03.741]  I mean, it's just total insanity.
[00:14:04.821 --> 00:14:07.202]  It's like you have these pro-Palestinian protesters out here.
[00:14:11.022 --> 00:14:12.943]  I mean, we've just gone full retard, okay?
[00:14:13.163 --> 00:14:13.403]  I just...
[00:14:15.845 --> 00:14:17.707]  Like, what in the hell?
[00:14:17.747 --> 00:14:22.330]  You're out here in your pro-Palestinian protest and now it's merging with this illegal immigrant arrival.
[00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:26.073]  I mean, it's just total insanity.
[00:14:28.515 --> 00:14:29.556]  It's just total lunacy.
[00:14:29.756 --> 00:14:32.058]  It's the signs of a lost nation.
[00:14:32.278 --> 00:14:34.580]  It's the signs of a broken civilization.
[00:14:35.061 --> 00:14:37.903]  It's the signs of a deranged and demented people.
[00:14:38.804 --> 00:14:39.644]  And that's what it is.
[00:14:41.866 --> 00:14:42.527]  That's what we have.
[00:14:44.141 --> 00:14:45.121]  This is so senseless.
[00:14:45.742 --> 00:14:47.122]  But here's the problem, getting back to it.
[00:14:48.483 --> 00:14:49.883]  Let's say they do come from Texas.
[00:14:50.043 --> 00:15:05.348]  Why the hell, why the hell are we paying, why the hell are we paying to have a bus, or hundreds of buses, take illegal immigrants from Texas to New York City?
[00:15:07.789 --> 00:15:09.370]  Why in the hell are we doing that?
[00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:19.154]  Here, here, let's put this into a bit of perspective.
[00:15:22.116 --> 00:15:29.701]  Why would the Democrats want illegal immigrants in New York and Illinois, specifically?
[00:15:29.841 --> 00:15:30.681]  Or Colorado?
[00:15:35.364 --> 00:15:36.105]  Or California?
[00:15:39.011 --> 00:15:39.852]  Why would they?
[00:15:40.272 --> 00:15:49.578]  Why would it be a bad decision for Abbott to send these illegal immigrants to New York or Chicago or Denver?
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.821]  Because they get counted on the census.
[00:15:56.323 --> 00:16:04.349]  And so these states, these blue states that are hemorrhaging their population into Texas, into Florida,
[00:16:05.362 --> 00:16:11.566]  Are now getting these Electoral College votes back via the illegal immigrants that count on the census!
[00:16:13.427 --> 00:16:24.614]  So here's James Comer trying to end this nightmare, trying to end this ridiculous policy, and do you think it's going to pass?
[00:16:24.634 --> 00:16:27.255]  Do you think the Democrats are going to say, yep, only U.S.
[00:16:27.295 --> 00:16:30.958]  citizens should count on the census that deals with the Electoral College?
[00:16:31.278 --> 00:16:32.819]  Here's James Comer breaking it down, clip 11.
[00:16:36.394 --> 00:16:40.797]  HR 7109, the Equal Representation Act, does two simple things.
[00:16:41.858 --> 00:16:49.503]  First, the bill requires the Census Bureau to include a citizenship question on the decennial census questionnaire.
[00:16:50.604 --> 00:16:59.090]  Second, the bill directs that this information be used to ensure fair representation by requiring only citizens be included in the apportionment.
[00:16:59.983 --> 00:17:01.544]  Yes or no.
[00:17:01.564 --> 00:17:01.764]  That's it.
[00:17:22.148 --> 00:17:30.397]  The Census Bureau currently estimates the non-citizen population using survey data from the Census-administered American Community Survey.
[00:17:30.957 --> 00:17:33.961]  But that data is not based on the entire population.
[00:17:35.256 --> 00:17:39.278]  It's only an estimate and suffers from large margins of error.
[00:17:40.239 --> 00:17:46.021]  In the past, opponents of a citizenship question have raised concerns that such a question will discourage participation in the census.
[00:17:46.702 --> 00:17:54.426]  The theory being that some individuals will be reluctant to respond to the census, especially if they do not have a lawful immigration status.
[00:17:56.006 --> 00:18:04.751]  My amendment in the nature of a substitute does not require respondents to indicate what immigration status they have or any other related demographic information.
[00:18:05.509 --> 00:18:11.590]  We just want to know, very simply, are you a citizen or are you a non-citizen?
[00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:13.150]  It's an easy question.
[00:18:14.211 --> 00:18:19.531]  It isn't confusing, and it doesn't reveal anything about an individual's specific immigration status.
[00:18:20.632 --> 00:18:26.233]  Although the census will count and enumerate all individuals residing in the United States, H.R.
[00:18:26.253 --> 00:18:34.154]  7109 would then ensure that only citizens are included in the apportionment base by which representation in Congress is allocated.
[00:18:35.276 --> 00:18:43.920]  According to American Community Survey estimates, there are over 22 million non-citizens residing in the United States and the District of Columbia.
[00:18:44.721 --> 00:18:48.842]  These are foreign nationals who have not naturalized and cannot vote in federal elections.
[00:18:49.843 --> 00:18:53.925]  Non-citizens comprise nearly 7% of the total population of the United States.
[00:18:53.945 --> 00:18:53.925]  7%.
[00:18:53.965 --> 00:18:55.085]  But non-citizens
[00:18:58.996 --> 00:18:59.577]  I don't know.
[00:19:22.383 --> 00:19:27.866]  I want to thank Representative Edwards, a former member of this committee, for his leadership on this issue.
[00:19:28.047 --> 00:19:32.689]  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I now recognize the ranking member.
[00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.132]  So this is basically advanced gerrymandering.
[00:19:37.252 --> 00:19:47.359]  Now this is a single item, single line bill, common sense, to include the question on the next sentence, are you a U.S.
[00:19:47.399 --> 00:19:47.799]  citizen?
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.901]  Now how do you think that's going to fare in Congress?
[00:19:53.746 --> 00:19:54.406]  Think it's going to pass?
[00:19:54.426 --> 00:19:55.026]  Of course not.
[00:19:56.387 --> 00:19:57.027]  And do you know why?
[00:19:57.867 --> 00:20:06.169]  Well, aside from the political reasons why, let's explain how corrupted and disgusting our political system is.
[00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:14.331]  There will be a back and forth, and this is how you end up with this pork barrel spending and thousand page long bills that nobody reads.
[00:20:16.212 --> 00:20:19.633]  The Republicans and Democrats will get behind closed doors, and the Democrats will say,
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:28.283]  You want us to vote for this bill to put a question on the census of, are you a citizen?
[00:20:28.344 --> 00:20:29.464]  Okay, well, here's what we want.
[00:20:29.504 --> 00:20:31.045]  And then they add three other lines to it.
[00:20:32.746 --> 00:20:35.628]  We want this funding for this illegal immigrant status.
[00:20:35.648 --> 00:20:36.508]  We want this for that.
[00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:37.249]  We want this for that.
[00:20:37.289 --> 00:20:40.131]  And so, okay, now you got four lines and four items on the bill.
[00:20:40.591 --> 00:20:44.974]  And then the Republicans say, well, okay, if we're going to give you that, then we want this, that, and the other thing too.
[00:20:45.474 --> 00:20:48.196]  And then you got six, seven lines and six, seven items on the bill.
[00:20:48.356 --> 00:20:51.658]  And then it goes back and forth until there's 30 items from each side.
[00:20:53.288 --> 00:21:02.513]  Pork barrels spinning out the wazoo and then somehow the original intention of getting the citizenship question on the census is gone!
[00:21:04.154 --> 00:21:05.535]  That's how Congress works!
[00:21:12.519 --> 00:21:16.181]  So if I was a betting man, I'd say that we're not going to get this to pass.
[00:21:17.912 --> 00:21:19.653]  Because that's how corrupt our system is.
[00:21:20.013 --> 00:21:35.378]  And even the Republican Party, that might have a majority in the House, has corrupt individuals that are either just outright corrupt or just Democrats pretending to be Republicans, like Dan Crenshaw, who will sabotage any agenda the Republicans have in the House.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:41.740]  So let's get back to the issue.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.981]  This is advanced gerrymandering.
[00:21:48.387 --> 00:22:02.172]  Electoral College, and we can talk about each number of electoral votes that the states get, and how this inflates blue states' numbers, like Colorado, which is a blue state now, and Illinois, and New York City, and California.
[00:22:03.012 --> 00:22:06.433]  They get to inflate their electoral college numbers with illegal immigrants.
[00:22:07.694 --> 00:22:08.614]  But what else do they do?
[00:22:08.874 --> 00:22:10.555]  That James Comer points out there.
[00:22:11.175 --> 00:22:13.356]  They inflate their representation in Congress.
[00:22:15.056 --> 00:22:17.397]  And then they can engage in even more gerrymandering.
[00:22:18.567 --> 00:22:29.914]  So they inflate the population density, the population in blue cities like Chicago, like New York City, and then they have to redistrict!
[00:22:32.076 --> 00:22:34.077]  And what do they do when they redistrict?
[00:22:34.117 --> 00:22:35.798]  Have you ever looked at a district map?
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:39.441]  Pull up any
[00:22:40.797 --> 00:22:42.338]  Major metropolitan area.
[00:22:42.358 --> 00:22:46.422]  Pull up any blue city district map and it looks like the dumbest thing you've ever seen in your life.
[00:22:46.782 --> 00:22:47.403]  Look at Houston.
[00:22:47.723 --> 00:22:48.444]  Look at Chicago.
[00:22:48.724 --> 00:22:49.625]  Look at New York City.
[00:22:52.887 --> 00:22:54.008]  Why do these...
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:58.581]  District breakdowns make no sense at all.
[00:22:58.941 --> 00:23:01.402]  Well, they do make sense if you're thinking politically.
[00:23:01.842 --> 00:23:06.024]  They do make sense if you're thinking about how to split votes so that Democrats always win.
[00:23:06.544 --> 00:23:10.285]  Then they make sense, and that's how they draw the districts.
[00:23:11.405 --> 00:23:21.489]  So they say, well, we've got this population boom, we've got this population density, we've got these new demographics, because now the Democrats write laws that say you have to consider demographics.
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.021]  Win right in congressional maps.
[00:23:25.121 --> 00:23:25.862]  Well, why would they do that?
[00:23:26.162 --> 00:23:27.203]  Because they want to win!
[00:23:27.263 --> 00:23:27.984]  That's all it is!
[00:23:28.004 --> 00:23:31.046]  That's all it is!
[00:23:33.929 --> 00:23:43.917]  Why do they draw up maps that look like hooks and ladders and... Because they're drawing them up so that the Democrats win every race!
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:50.023]  And then you get the illegal immigrant boom and you get to redistrict.
[00:23:50.223 --> 00:23:51.003]  And so what happens?
[00:23:51.043 --> 00:23:51.184]  Well...
[00:23:52.964 --> 00:24:04.891]  You have the downtown areas that are mostly blue, and have one set of demographics, but the Democrats say, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you can't have that.
[00:24:05.532 --> 00:24:08.033]  You can't have, we need to distribute demographics.
[00:24:08.894 --> 00:24:18.220]  And so they draw these lines and these hooks and these ladders, and what ends up happening is all the areas outside of the city, which are red,
[00:24:20.745 --> 00:24:25.987]  They then siphon votes, and they do this mathematically, they do this very precise.
[00:24:26.127 --> 00:24:27.528]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[00:24:28.368 --> 00:24:40.053]  And so they read district and they draw the maps so that they siphon just enough votes from the inner city into the county areas so that Democrats win those races too.
[00:24:43.234 --> 00:24:48.476]  So instead of having a population dense area in an inner city that might be 80%, maybe 90% Democrat,
[00:24:51.411 --> 00:25:09.258]  They then fraction it off, and split these votes into all these red counties, so that now you've got, well maybe downtown is now 60% blue, but now all these other counties that would normally be 80% red, now they're like 50-50!
[00:25:09.558 --> 00:25:14.140]  That's what they do.
[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.180]  That's what James Comer is talking about here.
[00:25:16.501 --> 00:25:19.942]  That's why illegal immigrants shouldn't count on the census.
[00:25:23.834 --> 00:25:30.384]  And so again, you go back to the original question, but you've got to zoom in on the cities to really see it.
[00:25:31.726 --> 00:25:33.609]  Doing the state view like that doesn't do it justice.
[00:25:33.629 --> 00:25:36.193]  You've got to zoom in on the cities and look at these district maps.
[00:25:36.794 --> 00:25:38.096]  It's clown, it's clown world.
[00:25:40.953 --> 00:25:42.714]  Say, so wait, why does it look like that?
[00:25:43.255 --> 00:25:44.275]  Why would the Democrats do that?
[00:25:44.536 --> 00:25:55.483]  Why would the Democrats, from even Obama's years, 20 years ago, Obama years, why would the Democrats go from being anti-illegal immigration to pro-illegal immigration?
[00:25:55.964 --> 00:26:04.410]  I mean, 20 years ago the Democrats' stance, in the 90s the Democrats' stance was, Republicans are pro-illegal immigrants because the rich businessmen got cheap labor.
[00:26:06.211 --> 00:26:06.972]  Even just
[00:26:08.527 --> 00:26:13.308]  Recently enough, as Barack Obama, they were anti-illegal immigration as policies.
[00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.230]  So why the change?
[00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:26.871]  Because for Democrats, it's all about raw power.
[00:26:27.951 --> 00:26:29.352]  It's not really about policy.
[00:26:29.732 --> 00:26:35.133]  The Democrat Party policy will change depending on what's advantageous for them to maintain power.
[00:26:39.448 --> 00:26:41.970]  So that's why they don't want a citizenship question on the census.
[00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:44.251]  That's why they want open borders.
[00:26:44.411 --> 00:26:45.432]  They want the power.
[00:26:46.813 --> 00:26:48.994]  But of course, it's not that they even want the power.
[00:26:49.034 --> 00:26:51.556]  Of course they do want the power, but it's not that they want the power.
[00:26:51.896 --> 00:26:53.277]  They need the power.
[00:26:55.458 --> 00:26:56.219]  They need the power.
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:07.786]  How can you, as a leftist, which is what the Democrats are now, how can you, as a leftist,
[00:27:11.138 --> 00:27:13.360]  Actually enforce your policies without power.
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:13.941]  You can't.
[00:27:14.821 --> 00:27:17.244]  You can't force Americans to stop eating meat.
[00:27:17.684 --> 00:27:21.247]  You can't force Americans to stop driving a gas-powered vehicle.
[00:27:21.287 --> 00:27:24.390]  You can't force Americans to stop having a gas-powered stove.
[00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:28.874]  You can't force Americans to take a vaccine or wear a mask.
[00:27:32.477 --> 00:27:35.460]  You can't do that unless you have power.
[00:27:39.707 --> 00:27:44.792]  So every policy that the Democrats want to enact needs power.
[00:27:45.572 --> 00:27:50.577]  And in order to attain power in the United States of America, you have to do so politically.
[00:27:50.617 --> 00:28:01.567]  So every measurement they make is how can they get more power to influence, interfere, and control your life.
[00:28:03.989 --> 00:28:05.211]  So you'd think common sense
[00:28:06.257 --> 00:28:11.399]  We should have a citizenship question on the census to find out how many citizens are here and non-citizens are here.
[00:28:11.819 --> 00:28:13.120]  The Democrats aren't interested.
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.261]  Because that would do them a disservice.
[00:28:19.762 --> 00:28:20.943]  It would hurt their power.
[00:28:24.504 --> 00:28:26.725]  So we'll see how this goes, but it will be another example.
[00:28:28.823 --> 00:28:36.152]  And you hope that the people in New York and Chicago and Denver that normally vote Democrat are watching what's happening with this illegal immigrant issue.
[00:28:36.232 --> 00:28:40.237]  I mean, the numbers, the money that is pouring in to these illegal immigrants.
[00:28:40.257 --> 00:28:41.218]  I mean, it's just every day.
[00:28:41.238 --> 00:28:45.123]  10 million here, 90 million there, 900 million there.
[00:28:45.643 --> 00:28:46.645]  All for illegal immigrants.
[00:28:48.297 --> 00:28:50.702]  Well, the average American is suffering financially.
[00:28:50.723 --> 00:28:52.767]  I mean, we can talk about Bidenomics when we get back.
[00:28:53.388 --> 00:28:55.152]  The news on that front's pretty wild, too.
[00:28:55.473 --> 00:28:57.678]  But hey, why should the American be good?
[00:28:57.718 --> 00:28:58.820]  The illegal immigrants need that.

[00:31:52.441 --> 00:31:55.962]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:31:56.022 --> 00:32:01.625]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[00:32:01.785 --> 00:32:02.125]  Thank you.
[00:32:02.325 --> 00:32:04.886]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[00:32:04.966 --> 00:32:06.206]  I started taking that stuff.
[00:32:06.246 --> 00:32:09.448]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[00:32:09.548 --> 00:32:10.468]  When did you start taking it?
[00:32:10.728 --> 00:32:14.890]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:18.052]  And I started eating a little better, but my blood pressure stayed high.
[00:32:18.072 --> 00:32:25.577]  And when I took X2-Iodine, after about three or four weeks, I think my body was detoxified of a bunch of metals and stuff that my body was storing.
[00:32:25.697 --> 00:32:27.899]  And my blood pressure came down to the perfect level.
[00:32:28.299 --> 00:32:31.241]  And I tell people, the only thing I did was X2-Iodine.
[00:32:31.681 --> 00:32:45.574]  And even though I do think all your other products are good, I recommend to anybody that they start with X2 Iodine because it detoxifies your body and kind of kicks your natural DNA into full force.
[00:32:45.654 --> 00:32:49.117]  So, in my life, I found X2 Iodine to be best.
[00:32:49.597 --> 00:32:53.040]  I tried other iodines and they didn't have the same effect.
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:55.642]  So, X2 Iodine, I really wanted to point that out.
[00:33:01.676 --> 00:33:05.759]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:06.299 --> 00:33:07.620]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:16.707 --> 00:33:25.673]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:26.153 --> 00:33:29.455]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:33.741]  I got something that tells me what it's all about.
[00:33:33.761 --> 00:33:38.183]  I got soul and I'm super bad.
[00:33:38.203 --> 00:33:41.524]  I got soul and I'm super bad.
[00:33:41.564 --> 00:33:45.325]  There's more on this illegal immigrant issue.
[00:33:45.726 --> 00:33:46.406]  It's just...
[00:33:56.934 --> 00:34:00.699]  Americans have to understand why the Democrats do what they do.
[00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:02.961]  It's all measured.
[00:34:03.161 --> 00:34:11.972]  It's all at the attempt to gain as much political power as they possibly can because they cannot enforce their policy without it.
[00:34:14.134 --> 00:34:15.636]  So they need to control Congress.
[00:34:15.676 --> 00:34:17.078]  They need to control the White House.
[00:34:19.249 --> 00:34:21.490]  Otherwise, how are they going to tell you how to live your life?
[00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:23.211]  Which is what the left does.
[00:34:23.472 --> 00:34:26.954]  That's the classical political left-wing paradigm.
[00:34:27.314 --> 00:34:27.874]  Communism.
[00:34:28.054 --> 00:34:28.615]  Socialism.
[00:34:28.655 --> 00:34:30.476]  Telling you how to live your life.
[00:34:31.417 --> 00:34:36.320]  You, an American, want the freedom to decide how to live your life.
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:44.084]  You, the American, have a birthright to determine your destiny.
[00:34:45.305 --> 00:34:48.167]  But not if the American left has their way.
[00:34:54.090 --> 00:35:08.200]  So that's why it's important for people to understand how this all works and why it seems to go against all common sense, this illegal immigration that the Biden administration is bringing in and then not wanting to have a question of citizenship on the census.
[00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:14.684]  No, it actually makes perfect sense when you realize that the entire aim of the Democrat Party is power.
[00:35:15.825 --> 00:35:17.086]  Now everything makes sense.
[00:35:20.388 --> 00:35:23.010]  But they also like to kind of bitch slap you around too.
[00:35:24.741 --> 00:35:29.765]  Make sure you know that the illegal immigrant criminals can get out of prison, but not you.
[00:35:29.945 --> 00:35:36.430]  Migrant repeat offenders viciously attack cops during busts for ransacking New York City Target.
[00:35:38.351 --> 00:35:49.640]  A crew of Venezuelan migrants, likely gang members with rap sheets, allegedly pounced on New York's finest after getting caught red-handed stealing from an Upper East Side Target and most of them are now back on the streets.
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:50.220]  Oh yeah!
[00:35:51.401 --> 00:35:52.362]  Hell yeah!
[00:35:54.474 --> 00:35:55.755]  Why in the hell?
[00:35:56.515 --> 00:35:59.777]  Is Greg Abbott dumb?
[00:35:59.797 --> 00:36:04.680]  Or is he doing what the Democrats want him to do?
[00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:07.022]  Is he doing what the World Economic Forum wants him to do?
[00:36:07.802 --> 00:36:14.206]  Why would Greg Abbott continue to send illegal immigrants and bus illegal immigrants to New York instead of sending them back to Mexico?
[00:36:15.567 --> 00:36:17.588]  Or just keep them in Texas?
[00:36:19.249 --> 00:36:23.011]  And look, as somebody that's in Texas, you think I like that?
[00:36:23.031 --> 00:36:23.932]  Of course not!
[00:36:25.922 --> 00:36:30.685]  I don't like seeing what they do to El Paso and McAllen and all these other areas.
[00:36:32.926 --> 00:36:35.308]  But I mean, let's think strategically here.
[00:36:37.449 --> 00:36:47.916]  If you're not going to send them back to Mexico, or you're not going to send them back to whatever country they came from, and then you're going to send them to New York and do the Democrats a favor?
[00:36:48.016 --> 00:36:52.439]  And you think, oh well, this is going to politically hurt them.
[00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:54.220]  Really?
[00:36:56.738 --> 00:36:57.739]  Are you sure about that?
[00:37:02.381 --> 00:37:03.201]  Why not come out?
[00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:04.422]  You've already done that stunt.
[00:37:04.902 --> 00:37:05.782]  Didn't change anything.
[00:37:07.323 --> 00:37:08.224]  Notice how nothing changed?
[00:37:08.804 --> 00:37:09.904]  So you already made your stunt.
[00:37:10.945 --> 00:37:12.546]  And maybe it hurt the Democrats politically.
[00:37:12.586 --> 00:37:13.166]  Maybe it didn't.
[00:37:13.226 --> 00:37:15.527]  But you've made your stunt.
[00:37:15.587 --> 00:37:16.408]  You've played your hand.
[00:37:17.608 --> 00:37:19.369]  Maybe now it's time for a change of tact.
[00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:21.010]  Maybe now it's time to play a new hand.
[00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:25.172]  And say, okay, we've got a new strategy here.
[00:37:29.085 --> 00:37:32.007]  And just get whatever, billions of dollars from the Biden administration.
[00:37:32.107 --> 00:37:32.848]  I don't like any of this.
[00:37:32.948 --> 00:37:43.436]  I'd send them home and just say, okay, we're going to build massive illegal immigrant shelters like they have in New York and other places.
[00:37:43.456 --> 00:37:45.077]  The Biden administration can pay for it.
[00:37:46.358 --> 00:37:47.379]  The American people can pay for it.
[00:37:49.775 --> 00:38:01.764]  And then you come out and you make a public statement and you say, wow, I realize now why the Democrats want illegal immigrants in their cities, because it increases their population and their census count and their congressional mapping.
[00:38:02.865 --> 00:38:04.987]  So we're going to do that for Texas now.
[00:38:08.117 --> 00:38:08.857]  Go ahead, let's see it.
[00:38:08.918 --> 00:38:14.221]  You've already made your political stunt sending them to these Democrat cities that claim they want them and then complain when they get them.
[00:38:14.961 --> 00:38:23.707]  So now, why don't you keep them here and say, you know what, we're going to increase our population so that we can have more congressional seats and that we can have more electoral college votes.
[00:38:23.727 --> 00:38:24.227]  How about that?
[00:38:24.327 --> 00:38:25.668]  Come out and make that statement, Greg.
[00:38:32.693 --> 00:38:33.113]  Don't worry.
[00:38:34.542 --> 00:38:39.584]  They beat police officers, they rob convenience stores, they rape people.
[00:38:39.764 --> 00:38:41.605]  It's just illegal immigrant crime.
[00:38:41.645 --> 00:38:47.888]  These gang members, carjackings, home invasions, and then they get released right back out on the streets.
[00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:55.151]  But they get released right back out on the streets.
[00:38:55.171 --> 00:39:00.073]  But if you share Ashley Biden's diary with the press, you're going to jail for a month.
[00:39:01.237 --> 00:39:02.378]  So they now confirm it's real.
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:11.629]  And so I guess, uh... These Democrats are just sick, man.
[00:39:14.572 --> 00:39:16.895]  They are just truly, truly sick people.
[00:39:17.215 --> 00:39:18.216]  There's no other way to put it.
[00:39:18.296 --> 00:39:19.538]  Just sick people.
[00:39:21.164 --> 00:39:23.465]  And then you get this clown show.
[00:39:23.885 --> 00:39:29.626]  CIA wants Congress to expand top-secret eavesdropping program to fight against fentanyl crisis.
[00:39:30.206 --> 00:39:32.627]  It's all coming in from the southern border.
[00:39:32.967 --> 00:39:33.987]  They all know it.
[00:39:34.127 --> 00:39:35.307]  This is a huge joke.
[00:39:35.868 --> 00:39:40.709]  Tucson CBP agent sees enough fentanyl and meth to kill billions of people.
[00:39:41.049 --> 00:39:43.809]  Folks, everybody knows the fentanyl comes in from the southern border.
[00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:49.991]  And they say, gee, the CIA is going to get down to the bottom of this.
[00:39:50.885 --> 00:39:53.387]  CIA says, well gee, we need to do more.
[00:39:54.288 --> 00:39:59.091]  We need to figure out where this fentanyl is coming from.
[00:39:59.391 --> 00:40:00.572]  So we need to spy.
[00:40:00.652 --> 00:40:02.293]  We need more spy power.
[00:40:03.074 --> 00:40:03.454]  Yeah.
[00:40:04.555 --> 00:40:05.976]  We don't know where it's coming from.
[00:40:06.036 --> 00:40:07.237]  We have no idea.
[00:40:07.637 --> 00:40:09.018]  We just can't figure it out.
[00:40:09.459 --> 00:40:13.682]  So give us more power to spy on the American people.
[00:40:13.882 --> 00:40:17.965]  We just have no idea where it's coming from.
[00:40:18.005 --> 00:40:19.146]  It's actually like a big joke.
[00:40:22.606 --> 00:40:26.909]  I happened to meet a couple fentanyl dealers in prison.
[00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:29.550]  Yeah, it's a joke.
[00:40:30.811 --> 00:40:32.212]  I mean, they don't mince their words.
[00:40:32.232 --> 00:40:33.933]  They're like, oh yeah, all of it comes from the southern border.
[00:40:37.055 --> 00:40:40.057]  And it either comes from China, but it all goes through Mexico.
[00:40:41.358 --> 00:40:49.022]  And the Mexican cartels are basically the middleman for China, but some of it gets developed south of the border as well.
[00:40:49.963 --> 00:40:51.304]  And then they work with the gangs
[00:40:52.637 --> 00:40:56.078]  They work with the gangs, the North American gangs, and they bring them in.
[00:40:57.119 --> 00:40:57.639]  Loads of fentanyl.
[00:40:58.419 --> 00:40:58.820]  I met them.
[00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:00.380]  They told me the whole thing.
[00:41:01.821 --> 00:41:03.081]  They're like, yeah, it's not a secret.
[00:41:03.101 --> 00:41:03.682]  Everybody knows it.
[00:41:06.063 --> 00:41:20.309]  And one guy's like, well, you know, Biden was really good for my business because it was hard to, you'd have to pay a lot of money before to get a mule to actually bring the drugs across.
[00:41:21.673 --> 00:41:25.078]  In the Trump years, nobody wanted to bring the drugs across.
[00:41:25.158 --> 00:41:25.979]  It was a big risk.
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:33.469]  And so, you'd have to pay a mule a real hefty amount of money if you could even find one.
[00:41:33.489 --> 00:41:36.574]  A lot of times you'd have to do it yourself and that's how people would wind up in prison.
[00:41:37.699 --> 00:41:42.820]  So these big drug dealers, when Biden got in, they're like, this is the greatest thing ever.
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:51.422]  They can pay a mule cheap or they can do it themselves now because the risk of getting pulled over or getting stopped at the border has gone down significantly.
[00:41:53.882 --> 00:42:00.643]  This is like open common rhetoric in the drug game.
[00:42:02.744 --> 00:42:03.684]  And this one guy's like, well,
[00:42:05.706 --> 00:42:12.193]  Yeah, I'd have to pay a mule a lot of money, and it would hurt my bottom line, or I'd have to go do it, and I'd have to risk going to prison.
[00:42:12.453 --> 00:42:19.921]  Some people would get caught when Trump was president, but when Biden was, with Biden in there, it's like, it's so easy.
[00:42:20.101 --> 00:42:20.762]  It's just a joke.
[00:42:20.782 --> 00:42:21.983]  We're making so much more money now.
[00:42:23.064 --> 00:42:27.029]  But he's also got kids, and then he's kind of looking back, and he's like, well,
[00:42:29.758 --> 00:42:33.699]  Like, yeah, I kind of support Biden, but man, what kind of future is this country gonna have for my kids?
[00:42:33.719 --> 00:42:36.879]  So, I mean, it's like, even the people bringing this in know, well, there's certain advantages.
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:47.101]  But hey, guys, the CIA doesn't know where the fentanyl's coming from, and they need to spy on you, and they need to eavesdrop to try to figure out where it's coming from, because we just don't know.
[00:42:47.381 --> 00:42:50.362]  I mean, everybody and their mama knows, but not the CIA.
[00:42:50.482 --> 00:42:53.642]  The Central Intelligence Agency has no idea where the fentanyl is coming from.
[00:42:53.682 --> 00:42:56.183]  They need to spy on you to try to figure it out.
[00:42:56.363 --> 00:42:57.123]  I'll tell you right here.
[00:42:57.363 --> 00:42:58.003]  Southern border!
[00:42:58.023 --> 00:42:58.383]  There you go.
[00:42:59.994 --> 00:43:11.298]  There is nothing more frustrating to me, whether it comes to news or anything else we're doing, than to know I'm telling the truth and to know that it'll just listen to me and take action.
[00:43:11.759 --> 00:43:12.579]  It will change your life.
[00:43:13.419 --> 00:43:16.801]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have two great products that have been sold out for a long time.
[00:43:17.181 --> 00:43:19.842]  They're now back in stock at infowarestore.com.
[00:43:20.542 --> 00:43:23.967]  X3 is the highest quality iodine, the missing link.
[00:43:24.447 --> 00:43:26.370]  It is back in stock, 40% off.
[00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:32.076]  And so is TurboForce, 10-hour clean energy, naturally released.
[00:43:32.277 --> 00:43:33.038]  It is amazing.
[00:43:33.458 --> 00:43:35.681]  Both of these products fund the Infowar.
[00:43:36.282 --> 00:43:38.845]  So they could be placebo and it'd still be great if they fund the Infowar.
[00:43:39.165 --> 00:43:39.606]  They're not.
[00:43:40.226 --> 00:43:43.149]  If you'll just try TurboForce, you'll see the results in 30 minutes.
[00:43:43.469 --> 00:43:45.791]  Incredible energy for 10 hours without the letdown.
[00:43:46.172 --> 00:43:51.937]  But if you will just take X3 on average for about two weeks, you will see amazing results because it's the missing link.
[00:43:52.578 --> 00:43:58.704]  X3 and TurboForce, both discounted now for a limited time at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:44:00.231 --> 00:44:05.693]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[00:44:06.434 --> 00:44:10.716]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[00:44:11.116 --> 00:44:15.498]  We finally have a limited run, back in supply, at infowarestore.com.
[00:44:16.938 --> 00:44:19.700]  So many people have serious issues.
[00:44:19.981 --> 00:44:21.102]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[00:44:21.542 --> 00:44:26.966]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[00:44:27.507 --> 00:44:32.911]  Most of the other iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements, so you don't download it.
[00:44:33.531 --> 00:44:36.294]  But this is pure atomic certified
[00:44:38.163 --> 00:44:39.404]  I don't know.
[00:45:00.862 --> 00:45:07.948]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days, with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large.
[00:45:08.549 --> 00:45:16.315]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep support formula, Down and Out, is just the thing.
[00:45:17.096 --> 00:45:23.462]  It's our new, faster-absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[00:45:24.116 --> 00:45:24.937]  We're good to go.
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:43.960]  We're good to go.
[00:46:05.794 --> 00:46:06.735]  Please support us.
[00:46:06.815 --> 00:46:07.296]  Get a book.
[00:46:07.356 --> 00:46:07.876]  Get a film.
[00:46:07.936 --> 00:46:09.097]  Get a Team Humanity t-shirt.
[00:46:09.578 --> 00:46:10.479]  Get Nitric Boost.
[00:46:10.519 --> 00:46:13.522]  Get it all at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:46:14.182 --> 00:46:16.725]  InfoWarStore.com.
[00:46:16.865 --> 00:46:18.046]  Get TurboForce.
[00:46:18.166 --> 00:46:19.868]  Get Next Level Foundational Energy.
[00:46:19.928 --> 00:46:21.890]  They're all incredible products.
[00:46:23.271 --> 00:46:26.393]  Next Level Foundational Energy is about to sell out, but it's not a stimulant.
[00:46:26.453 --> 00:46:27.833]  No, it's the energy of the cells.
[00:46:27.873 --> 00:46:28.754]  Different level energy.
[00:46:29.054 --> 00:46:29.914]  That's why it's Next Level.
[00:46:30.294 --> 00:46:32.155]  That's why TurboForce is 10-hour clean energy.
[00:46:32.195 --> 00:46:35.037]  It is a bunch of stimulants that are natural and good, with a good letdown.
[00:46:35.757 --> 00:46:36.177]  Amazing.
[00:46:36.537 --> 00:46:37.418]  TurboForce.
[00:46:37.458 --> 00:46:38.518]  Next Level Foundational Energy.
[00:46:39.299 --> 00:46:40.139]  You clean out your blood.
[00:46:40.339 --> 00:46:42.360]  Everybody should be on now.
[00:46:43.981 --> 00:46:44.761]  NitricBoost.
[00:46:45.142 --> 00:46:47.683]  InfoWarStore.com.
[00:46:47.823 --> 00:46:48.523]  NitricBoost.
[00:46:49.204 --> 00:46:50.144]  We're funded by the people.
[00:46:50.164 --> 00:46:50.964]  Thanks for your support.
[00:46:51.245 --> 00:46:51.745]  We'll be right back.
[00:46:53.631 --> 00:46:56.653]  I-I-InfoWarStore.com!
[00:47:00.975 --> 00:47:06.878]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[00:47:21.002 --> 00:47:30.209]  We're going to move on here from the illegal immigrant issue, open border issue.
[00:47:49.974 --> 00:47:52.676]  But I mean, this footage is just unreal.
[00:47:53.197 --> 00:47:58.862]  It's like a New York Knicks game just got let out of Madison Square Garden, except there wasn't a Knicks game in town.
[00:47:58.922 --> 00:47:59.602]  Oh, well, what is that?
[00:47:59.622 --> 00:48:01.644]  Oh, it's just illegal immigrants arriving from Texas.
[00:48:02.985 --> 00:48:04.967]  Another day, another arrival.
[00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:09.311]  Very frustrating stuff.
[00:48:09.371 --> 00:48:11.593]  Man, I am Jones-in here.
[00:48:11.973 --> 00:48:12.553]  I'm Jones-in.
[00:48:13.074 --> 00:48:13.774]  No pun intended.
[00:48:13.814 --> 00:48:15.336]  I'm Jones-in for some InfoWars coffee.
[00:48:15.396 --> 00:48:16.257]  What's frustrating is
[00:48:17.321 --> 00:48:20.162]  I've got the cup on my desk right here, but it's too hot.
[00:48:20.762 --> 00:48:21.522]  So I can't drink it.
[00:48:22.462 --> 00:48:23.183]  Very frustrating.
[00:48:23.303 --> 00:48:23.883]  You know what I mean?
[00:48:23.903 --> 00:48:24.363]  You ever have that?
[00:48:25.623 --> 00:48:33.526]  You just want to take a big gulp of some nice, fresh, bold-tasting coffee from Infowarsstore.com, but it's too hot to consume?
[00:48:36.386 --> 00:48:40.808]  So you kind of take the hit, you burn your tongue a little, but it's worth it.
[00:48:43.028 --> 00:48:44.669]  It's worth it.
[00:48:45.819 --> 00:48:49.943]  I'd love to take a nice big gulp of that, but it's just piping hot right now.
[00:48:50.023 --> 00:48:52.345]  Just fresh off the coffee pot there.
[00:48:52.365 --> 00:48:54.067]  So, that's right.
[00:48:54.167 --> 00:48:56.029]  The Tip of the Spear Dark Roast Coffee.
[00:48:56.269 --> 00:49:00.913]  Bold flavor at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:49:01.754 --> 00:49:07.219]  And it powers us through long days at the studio, long days at the office.
[00:49:07.279 --> 00:49:08.280]  It can work for you too.
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:08.640]  In fact,
[00:49:09.445 --> 00:49:20.094]  If you got an office, I'd purchase a bunch of that coffee from Inforestore.com and just keep it hot, keep it fresh, and your staff is going to love you.
[00:49:20.135 --> 00:49:21.256]  They're going to love that coffee.
[00:49:21.276 --> 00:49:25.900]  They're going to love you for having that coffee around, keeping a hot, fresh pot around.
[00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:29.303]  It might even increase productivity.
[00:49:30.264 --> 00:49:32.746]  It might even increase productivity and morale.
[00:49:35.342 --> 00:49:36.803]  So just a recommendation.
[00:49:37.343 --> 00:49:41.565]  I'd keep the coffee from InfoWarsTore.com around if I were you at your business.
[00:49:41.845 --> 00:49:51.970]  Just one of the great products we have at InfoWarsTore.com that helps us stay on the air despite all the attacks, which we're going to get into that in a second with some more news coming up.
[00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:56.112]  But so you see all the attacks against us and really
[00:49:57.276 --> 00:50:11.639]  It's not fair to say you've only seen the tip of the iceberg, because obviously we've seen a lot of the iceberg at this point, but there's still a lot of the stuff that you don't even see that goes on here on a day-to-day, and it's just wild.
[00:50:12.839 --> 00:50:13.459]  It's just wild.
[00:50:13.539 --> 00:50:15.299]  Most people in media don't have to deal with this stuff.
[00:50:15.319 --> 00:50:17.099]  They can just focus on doing media.
[00:50:17.159 --> 00:50:21.960]  The things that we have to deal with and then still do live media, there's nothing like InfoWars on the planet.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.681]  So shop at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:50:23.741 --> 00:50:24.641]  All the great supplements.
[00:50:27.657 --> 00:50:34.579]  Water filters, the emergency food supply, stuff that you need, infowarestore.com, it's your support there that keeps us on the air.
[00:50:34.619 --> 00:50:38.420]  So, a second video now, and I guess I have time to just roll this.
[00:50:39.361 --> 00:50:40.501]  So we'll just roll the whole thing.
[00:50:40.601 --> 00:50:52.465]  Second part two of this claimed CIA agent, O-O-Penis, O-O-O-Benus, Oblinus, now talking about Ukraine being a well-known secret that it's run by the State Department.
[00:50:52.505 --> 00:50:52.885]  Here it is.
[00:50:54.926 --> 00:50:55.306]  What are we doing?
[00:50:57.043 --> 00:50:57.723]  Whenever we need to.
[00:50:57.963 --> 00:50:59.924]  We're under State Department cover.
[00:51:00.165 --> 00:51:01.925]  So Ukraine doesn't even know that CIA is there?
[00:51:02.145 --> 00:51:02.526]  Oh, they know.
[00:51:02.546 --> 00:51:03.006]  Oh, do they?
[00:51:03.026 --> 00:51:05.267]  I mean, it's a well-known secret, right?
[00:51:05.327 --> 00:51:05.507]  Right.
[00:51:05.707 --> 00:51:07.908]  Because we're the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:51:07.928 --> 00:51:08.428]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:51:08.448 --> 00:51:10.770]  We give them intelligence and advice all the time.
[00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:12.270]  I mean, it's like advisors.
[00:51:12.310 --> 00:51:14.311]  Like, this is what the U.S.
[00:51:14.351 --> 00:51:14.991]  would do.
[00:51:15.112 --> 00:51:15.372]  Okay.
[00:51:15.472 --> 00:51:19.173]  I did what they call the credible fear interviews for people who seek asylum.
[00:51:19.273 --> 00:51:20.494]  I did that for like 3,000 people.
[00:51:20.534 --> 00:51:24.236]  Most of the people get there knowing they're not going to qualify, but they try.
[00:51:25.026 --> 00:51:28.768]  Because, you know, if you do it enough times, you get a sympathetic ear, and they're like, approved.
[00:51:31.009 --> 00:51:38.772]  Recall Gavin Oblentis, the CIA officer who currently manages multi-million dollar contracts across government agencies and private sector vendors.
[00:51:38.913 --> 00:51:43.315]  Before the CIA, Oblentis worked for the FBI, and then briefly for Homeland Security.
[00:51:43.335 --> 00:51:48.197]  Yeah, I do have a copy of the paper.
[00:51:48.257 --> 00:51:49.458]  Now I can tell the difference.
[00:51:49.498 --> 00:51:50.198]  See, there you go.
[00:51:52.063 --> 00:52:10.554]  Let me pull out of this and we'll play the rest of this in the five-minute segment coming up because I want to follow it up and I want to play something from Congressman Troy Nels, but... Because this is the proper response that we're about to get from Troy Nels.
[00:52:11.555 --> 00:52:17.939]  Because it's likely this O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O
[00:52:19.076 --> 00:52:23.137]  And he's bloviating there to try to impress somebody he meets on a grinder date.
[00:52:24.718 --> 00:52:29.299]  And who knows what real intel he has or access he has or anything.
[00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:34.261]  To me it looks like it's likely this guy is just bragging and really has nothing to do with any of it.
[00:52:34.361 --> 00:52:38.262]  Now having said that, he might be repeating things he hears around the office.
[00:52:39.302 --> 00:52:45.664]  He might represent the same mindset of the people that have the powers and the people that are in the field and running these operations.
[00:52:46.405 --> 00:52:47.385]  That's the big question.
[00:52:49.565 --> 00:52:50.846]  But I mean, this guy's just a clown.
[00:52:51.706 --> 00:52:52.947]  Oh, I can't tell you who I work with.
[00:52:52.967 --> 00:52:53.487]  You work for the CIA?
[00:52:53.527 --> 00:52:54.507]  Yeah, I work for the CIA.
[00:52:55.908 --> 00:52:58.049]  Oh, I can't tell you how much money the contracts I sign are worth.
[00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:59.330]  You sign $300 million contracts?
[00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:00.690]  Yeah, I sign $300 million contracts.
[00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:01.431]  Yeah, yeah, that's me.
[00:53:03.152 --> 00:53:04.892]  As he sits there and eats hamburger lettuce.
[00:53:06.473 --> 00:53:14.037]  So, I mean, it's likely this guy is just a... a... a... a bloviating... homo...
[00:53:16.209 --> 00:53:21.094]  Trying to impress a grinder date and he likely has nothing to do with any operations at all.
[00:53:22.676 --> 00:53:34.188]  But that doesn't take away from the legitimacy here that these things are likely still going on and he's probably just overhearing them or seeing them or he's a desk jockey.
[00:53:35.726 --> 00:53:43.591]  And he deals with the transcripts, or he deals with the audio recordings when people are talking about this stuff, whether it's destroying Alex Jones or running Ukraine.
[00:53:44.212 --> 00:53:52.437]  Now, here's the response from Troy Nels, and why I haven't heard this from other members of Congress, specifically the Republican Party, is part of the problem.
[00:53:53.437 --> 00:53:58.921]  But here's Troy Nels with Benny Johnson addressing these videos.
[00:54:08.475 --> 00:54:21.624]  You say that only Donald Trump, nothing's going to change until Donald Trump gets back into office, and you put your money where your mouth is, or at least your fashion where your mouth is, during the State of the Union.
[00:54:22.925 --> 00:54:25.828]  We'll never forget your Never Surrender shirt.
[00:54:25.848 --> 00:54:34.014]  I think that's the official Trump shirt from the Trump store with Donald Trump's mugshot on it, and your exquisite bow tie along with the Lake & Riley pin.
[00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:41.943]  And so, some of your colleagues there, obviously just wearing the suit and tie, but you sir, you sir, what big?
[00:54:43.623 --> 00:54:48.965]  Yeah, I like to bow tie, probably need to cut back on the brownies and the cookies, you can see that a little bit.
[00:54:49.005 --> 00:54:52.407]  But overall, I thought I looked damper that evening.
[00:54:52.467 --> 00:55:01.250]  And it just was there to send the message, and that is, I and the people, the patriots across this country,
[00:55:01.850 --> 00:55:05.132]  That is part of that mega-movement, that Make America Great Again movement.
[00:55:05.492 --> 00:55:19.378]  I just want to let the American people know that there are people in Congress that supports Donald J. Trump to the end, and I will fight like hell, do everything I possibly can, that he can come back, get re-elected, and save this country.
[00:55:19.418 --> 00:55:20.519]  He's got to save our country.
[00:55:20.799 --> 00:55:22.179]  He's the only one that can do it.
[00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:27.222]  We had a pretty decent group on the stage, but nobody compares to Donald J. Trump.
[00:55:27.802 --> 00:55:31.684]  So once we get Trump in there, all of our country's ills will end.
[00:55:31.704 --> 00:55:32.785]  They'll all end.
[00:55:33.145 --> 00:55:34.226]  He'll fix it all.
[00:55:34.786 --> 00:55:36.707]  He will end the war in Ukraine.
[00:55:36.987 --> 00:55:42.150]  I predict Donald Trump wins, Putin's out of Ukraine by April 1st.
[00:55:42.951 --> 00:55:44.792]  He's gone.
[00:55:44.892 --> 00:55:45.572]  That's our dream.
[00:55:45.652 --> 00:55:47.453]  That's our dream.
[00:55:47.993 --> 00:55:53.036]  As a father, as somebody who's going to eventually have draft-aged children, I don't want war.
[00:55:53.256 --> 00:55:54.197]  I don't want it.
[00:55:54.417 --> 00:55:55.638]  As a taxpayer, I don't want war.
[00:55:58.272 --> 00:55:58.812]  God bless you.
[00:55:58.832 --> 00:55:59.872]  God bless your listeners.
[00:55:59.912 --> 00:56:01.273]  You're doing a hell of a job, Benny.
[00:56:01.713 --> 00:56:02.533]  Keep it up, buddy.
[00:56:02.933 --> 00:56:03.753]  This is what we need.
[00:56:04.214 --> 00:56:05.474]  We are being silenced.
[00:56:05.994 --> 00:56:10.535]  We are being silenced by the dishonest media, the greatest threat to our country, the dishonest media.
[00:56:10.575 --> 00:56:12.616]  So it's individuals like you and others.
[00:56:12.656 --> 00:56:17.557]  And Alex Jones, if you're listening, Alex Jones, you have a right to be a little bit flustered, right?
[00:56:17.917 --> 00:56:23.739]  Your feathers should be flustered right now with what that agent, that former CIA guy or that CIA guy said about you.
[00:56:24.099 --> 00:56:25.019]  And same with Tucker.
[00:56:25.459 --> 00:56:26.700]  I'll tell you, go after him.
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:27.441]  Go after him.
[00:56:27.781 --> 00:56:33.226]  This weaponization that the Republicans have said has happened with the DOJ, it's true, America.
[00:56:33.506 --> 00:56:34.907]  They're coming after Donald Trump.
[00:56:34.927 --> 00:56:37.670]  They're coming after anybody that's a mega-movement individual.
[00:56:38.010 --> 00:56:38.951]  We've got to push back.
[00:56:39.591 --> 00:56:40.893]  Let's win Trump 2020.
[00:56:41.913 --> 00:56:47.598]  Just really quickly, since you brought it up, would you be in favor of subpoenas to figure out if this guy is telling the truth about Alex Jones?
[00:56:47.638 --> 00:56:48.960]  If they agree we're targeting him?
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:51.942]  Listen, everybody says a lot of stuff up here.
[00:56:51.982 --> 00:56:53.483]  Betty, you say this, you say that.
[00:56:53.523 --> 00:56:56.726]  This guy, I kind of looked at the guy, he looked a little like he's a little different.
[00:56:57.086 --> 00:57:00.849]  But what I would do is I would try to confirm, verify what he said.
[00:57:01.189 --> 00:57:05.973]  And if it's true, if it's true, and if it's accurate, I think Alex Jones should go after.
[00:57:06.173 --> 00:57:07.434]  They should go after the federal government.
[00:57:07.454 --> 00:57:07.754]  So there it is.
[00:57:07.875 --> 00:57:15.300]  Congressman Troy Nels encourages Alex Jones to go after the government organizations that one contractor claims are targeting him.
[00:57:16.209 --> 00:57:17.049]  But that's right.
[00:57:17.409 --> 00:57:19.630]  That guy needs to be subpoenaed immediately.
[00:57:21.050 --> 00:57:25.831]  And this is good, obviously, for us to expose it dealing with us.
[00:57:26.171 --> 00:57:27.191]  It's not just about us.
[00:57:27.431 --> 00:57:30.012]  It's about... This is how corrupt our government is.
[00:57:30.312 --> 00:57:32.473]  And then all these other individuals that are on hidden camera.
[00:57:32.493 --> 00:57:34.313]  We got another one with James O'Keefe coming up too.
[00:57:34.433 --> 00:57:37.034]  Why aren't they being subpoenaed with the things they admit?
[00:57:38.194 --> 00:57:39.114]  Subpoena their ass!
[00:57:39.154 --> 00:57:40.494]  Get them to testify under oath!
[00:57:41.635 --> 00:57:43.375]  This is out of control at this point!
[00:57:49.506 --> 00:57:55.569]  I know, as viewers and listeners, you've heard callers call in and talk about how X3 has changed their life.
[00:57:56.229 --> 00:57:59.811]  You've heard listeners talk about how incredible 10-hour clean energy TurboForce is.
[00:58:00.451 --> 00:58:02.792]  Well, both products are back in stock right now.
[00:58:03.112 --> 00:58:13.217]  In fact, X3 has been sold out for more than six months, but despite that, it is 40% off, because I want the people who have never tried the product to try it.
[00:58:13.377 --> 00:58:17.218]  Our regular listeners and the folks that have already tried it are chomping at the bit to get it.
[00:58:17.518 --> 00:58:18.319]  We appreciate them.
[00:58:19.059 --> 00:58:22.200]  But less than 1% of you ever buy a product at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:23.221]  Go there.
[00:58:23.421 --> 00:58:24.701]  Try X3.
[00:58:25.101 --> 00:58:29.063]  Get the missing link that's essential to all electrochemical activity in your body.
[00:58:29.403 --> 00:58:32.704]  This is the purest, highest quality tri-iodine out there.
[00:58:33.264 --> 00:58:36.986]  You owe it to yourself to get a bottle and experience it for yourself.
[00:58:37.046 --> 00:58:38.326]  Takes a few weeks to kick in.
[00:58:38.806 --> 00:58:40.007]  On average, get X3.
[00:58:40.127 --> 00:58:45.689]  And while you're at it, get TurboForce 10-Hour Clean Energy at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:58:46.049 --> 00:58:47.930]  Both of them discounted right now.
[00:58:50.171 --> 00:58:53.292]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:58:53.312 --> 00:58:54.852]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:58:55.612 --> 00:58:58.653]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:58:59.553 --> 00:59:07.634]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:59:08.474 --> 00:59:16.256]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:59:17.296 --> 00:59:20.179]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:25.944]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:59:26.725 --> 00:59:29.728]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[00:59:29.768 --> 00:59:37.996]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:59:38.636 --> 00:59:42.341]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsware.com.
[00:59:43.001 --> 00:59:47.607]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsware.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:59:47.947 --> 00:59:48.788]  Please take action now.
[00:59:52.553 --> 00:59:56.458]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:02.244 --> 01:00:21.796]  Alright, I want to play the rest of the Sound Investigations video, part two, into Gavin Obenis, and we will just conclude that video and then get into some other news.
[01:00:22.116 --> 01:00:25.018]  So we also have another one from James O'Keefe talking about how
[01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:29.011]  The Fed was trying to sabotage Donald Trump.
[01:00:29.171 --> 01:00:29.832]  Oh, what do you know?
[01:00:30.072 --> 01:00:30.993]  Are there going to be subpoenas?
[01:00:31.613 --> 01:00:31.954]  Should be.
[01:00:32.314 --> 01:00:33.275]  Alright, so here's the rest of that.
[01:00:33.375 --> 01:00:34.415]  Sound Investigations, Part 2.
[01:00:34.476 --> 01:00:37.378]  HR 7109... What?
[01:00:37.418 --> 01:00:38.459]  What are we doing?
[01:00:48.166 --> 01:00:51.669]  Whatever we need to.
[01:00:56.286 --> 01:00:58.516]  I think we're having some tech problems with the video.
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.821]  It has the seal on it.
[01:01:03.861 --> 01:01:07.082]  See, I will tell her with my own eyes that I saw it.
[01:01:07.202 --> 01:01:09.763]  And it's hiring official Scott Hobson.
[01:01:09.863 --> 01:01:10.664]  I like the bureau, too.
[01:01:10.684 --> 01:01:11.564]  The bureau was a lot of fun.
[01:01:11.624 --> 01:01:13.405]  I got to do a lot of cool stuff at the bureau.
[01:01:13.425 --> 01:01:15.686]  I was the guy in the back of the truck, in the van.
[01:01:15.826 --> 01:01:25.270]  Speaking to a Sound Investigations undercover reporter, Oblenis seems to have confirmed an anonymously sourced New York Times article about the CIA's involvement in the Ukraine conflict.
[01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:27.370]  Are agents everywhere in the world?
[01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:28.071]  Every embassy?
[01:01:28.471 --> 01:01:29.331]  Even Ukraine?
[01:01:29.571 --> 01:01:29.671]  Yep.
[01:01:31.532 --> 01:01:33.074]  But that's not, I didn't, I didn't know that.
[01:01:33.555 --> 01:01:35.037]  Why wouldn't it be?
[01:01:35.277 --> 01:01:36.178]  Oh, right.
[01:01:36.579 --> 01:01:37.360]  What are we doing?
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:40.243]  Whatever we need to.
[01:01:42.065 --> 01:01:42.646]  Right.
[01:01:42.706 --> 01:01:44.629]  We're under steak department cover.
[01:01:45.868 --> 01:01:46.969]  We're good.
[01:01:46.989 --> 01:01:49.350]  So if I go overseas, my name will change.
[01:01:49.450 --> 01:01:50.750]  I'll have a full background.
[01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:53.691]  And if I go by that name, I'm overseas.
[01:01:53.732 --> 01:01:54.292]  Wow.
[01:01:55.232 --> 01:01:57.013]  So Ukraine doesn't even know that CIA is there?
[01:01:57.193 --> 01:01:57.673]  No, they know.
[01:01:57.933 --> 01:01:58.794]  Oh, do they?
[01:01:58.874 --> 01:02:00.354]  I mean, it's a well-known secret, right?
[01:02:00.414 --> 01:02:00.635]  Right.
[01:02:00.795 --> 01:02:03.036]  Because we're the Central Intelligence Agency.
[01:02:03.056 --> 01:02:05.197]  We're not allowed to operate inside the U.S.
[01:02:05.237 --> 01:02:06.077]  So what do we do?
[01:02:06.257 --> 01:02:07.297]  Go outside the U.S.
[01:02:08.878 --> 01:02:14.581]  So you guys must know a whole lot more about the Ukraine conflict than the news is actually saying.
[01:02:14.741 --> 01:02:14.841]  Yep.
[01:02:16.135 --> 01:02:17.136]  I mean, that's just what we do.
[01:02:17.437 --> 01:02:19.640]  I'm excited at it.
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:19.880]  Right.
[01:02:20.561 --> 01:02:25.687]  I don't, but, you know, I just, I just try to save the money and spend the money for it.
[01:02:25.807 --> 01:02:30.373]  When it comes to Ukraine, an agency can really get involved in the military, right?
[01:02:30.413 --> 01:02:33.076]  We give them intelligence and advice all the time.
[01:02:33.217 --> 01:02:34.298]  What about combat?
[01:02:35.219 --> 01:02:38.281]  No, we don't really do that.
[01:02:38.321 --> 01:02:40.682]  We're not allowed.
[01:02:40.842 --> 01:02:42.523]  It's like advisors.
[01:02:42.643 --> 01:02:43.343]  Advisors?
[01:02:43.403 --> 01:02:46.625]  Oh, so kind of like, in the form of a general?
[01:02:46.705 --> 01:02:47.225]  Mm-hmm.
[01:02:47.265 --> 01:02:49.406]  Like, this is what the U.S.
[01:02:49.446 --> 01:02:50.447]  would do.
[01:02:50.527 --> 01:02:51.127]  Okay.
[01:02:51.147 --> 01:02:53.288]  That was an idea.
[01:02:53.348 --> 01:02:56.950]  We did seize the billionaire shop from Russia.
[01:02:57.530 --> 01:02:58.671]  That must have been cool.
[01:02:58.731 --> 01:02:58.931]  It was.
[01:02:58.991 --> 01:03:03.232]  I've never seen a solid gold toilet, so I sat on it.
[01:03:03.312 --> 01:03:04.152]  You went in?
[01:03:04.192 --> 01:03:04.893]  Yeah!
[01:03:04.973 --> 01:03:07.133]  I wanted to take a picture.
[01:03:07.173 --> 01:03:08.834]  That's amazing!
[01:03:08.954 --> 01:03:10.615]  It was worth 970 million dollars.
[01:03:10.735 --> 01:03:11.555]  And who is this?
[01:03:11.675 --> 01:03:13.876]  One of Putin's oligarchs.
[01:03:13.916 --> 01:03:15.556]  We see each other.
[01:03:15.636 --> 01:03:16.056]  Oh my!
[01:03:16.096 --> 01:03:16.216]  Why?
[01:03:16.236 --> 01:03:16.957]  Just because.
[01:03:24.411 --> 01:03:25.051]  There was no need?
[01:03:25.091 --> 01:03:25.752]  No need for it.
[01:03:25.792 --> 01:03:26.132]  We just did it.
[01:03:26.152 --> 01:03:26.432]  Just because?
[01:03:26.472 --> 01:03:26.813]  He was there.
[01:03:26.833 --> 01:03:27.413]  How many times does the B.O.
[01:03:27.433 --> 01:03:27.593]  do that?
[01:03:27.613 --> 01:03:27.753]  A lot.
[01:03:27.773 --> 01:03:27.894]  Really?
[01:03:27.914 --> 01:03:27.994]  Yeah.
[01:03:28.014 --> 01:03:29.695]  He sees all kinds of people, other countries, people you don't like.
[01:03:29.715 --> 01:03:30.816]  He sees all kinds of people you don't like.
[01:03:30.836 --> 01:03:31.796]  He sees all kinds of people you don't like.
[01:03:31.816 --> 01:03:32.957]  He sees all kinds of people you don't like.
[01:03:32.997 --> 01:03:33.958]  He sees all kinds of people you don't like.
[01:03:33.978 --> 01:03:34.919]  He sees all kinds of people you don't like.
[01:03:34.939 --> 01:03:35.899]  He sees all kinds of people you don't like.
[01:03:35.959 --> 01:03:36.860]  He sees all kinds of people you don't like.
[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:37.801]  He sees all kinds of people you don't like.
[01:03:37.821 --> 01:03:38.721]  He sees all kinds of people you don't like.
[01:03:38.741 --> 01:03:39.702]  He sees all kinds of people you don't like.
[01:03:39.722 --> 01:03:40.583]  He sees all kinds of people you don't like.
[01:03:40.603 --> 01:03:41.704]  He sees all kinds of people you don't like.
[01:03:41.724 --> 01:03:42.664]  He sees all kinds of people you don't like.
[01:03:42.684 --> 01:03:43.665]  He sees all kinds of people you don't like.
[01:03:43.685 --> 01:03:44.666]  He sees all kinds of people you don't like.
[01:03:44.686 --> 01:03:45.006]  He sees
[01:03:46.869 --> 01:03:47.670]  We freeze them.
[01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:48.410]  That's good.
[01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:52.352]  We've got $35 billion of food and slurry frozen in New York.
[01:03:52.392 --> 01:03:53.412]  That's amazing.
[01:03:53.432 --> 01:03:53.593]  Good.
[01:03:53.613 --> 01:03:54.733]  That's not yours.
[01:03:54.753 --> 01:03:55.373]  Yeah, it is.
[01:03:55.513 --> 01:03:56.754]  It's in our accounts.
[01:03:57.194 --> 01:03:58.555]  It's on our shores.
[01:03:59.075 --> 01:04:02.357]  Why don't we use that to give you grain?
[01:04:02.577 --> 01:04:05.598]  I'm sure there's some legal reason we can't do it.
[01:04:05.658 --> 01:04:06.839]  That's interesting.
[01:04:06.879 --> 01:04:09.700]  Well, you know, then international money laws come into play.
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.641]  It gets a little murky.
[01:04:13.422 --> 01:04:17.667]  O'Blenis also spoke about his experience working for Homeland Security at the southern border.
[01:04:17.767 --> 01:04:21.671]  Just to prove to you I did work for Homeland Security.
[01:04:21.731 --> 01:04:24.174]  I'm O'Blenis, United States government.
[01:04:24.234 --> 01:04:25.215]  Oh, that's cool!
[01:04:25.255 --> 01:04:25.855]  So you know.
[01:04:25.956 --> 01:04:29.019]  I did what they call the credible fear interviews for people who seek asylum.
[01:04:29.139 --> 01:04:29.379]  Okay.
[01:04:31.881 --> 01:04:34.342]  So this guy is saying quite a lot.
[01:04:34.602 --> 01:04:41.364]  How much of it is real, how much of it is fake, how much of it is braggadocious, how much of it is just hearsay, how much of it is real.
[01:04:41.965 --> 01:04:43.025]  I think we deserve to know.
[01:04:43.065 --> 01:04:44.806]  I think congressional subpoenas need to fly.
[01:04:44.846 --> 01:04:49.708]  I think Gavin needs to be testifying under oath.
[01:04:49.808 --> 01:04:51.488]  Congressman Troy Nels agrees.
[01:04:51.908 --> 01:04:55.690]  Will other Republicans in the House say similar things, says Troy?
[01:05:00.001 --> 01:05:06.045]  I know, as viewers and listeners, you've heard callers call in and talk about how X3 has changed their life.
[01:05:06.726 --> 01:05:10.328]  You've heard listeners talk about how incredible 10-hour clean energy turbo force is.
[01:05:10.968 --> 01:05:13.290]  Well, both products are back in stock right now.
[01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:20.775]  In fact, X3 has been sold out for more than six months, but despite that, it is 40% off, because I want the people
[01:05:21.555 --> 01:05:22.076]  We're good to go.
[01:05:51.455 --> 01:05:56.176]  While you're at it, get TurboForce 10-hour clean energy at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:05:56.556 --> 01:05:58.517]  Both of them discounted right now.
[01:06:04.958 --> 01:06:08.899]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:06:09.319 --> 01:06:13.260]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:16.921]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:06:40.539 --> 01:06:42.662]  The Biden economy is going to be a problem at the polls.
[01:06:43.763 --> 01:06:47.406]  This is why Democrats are trying to focus so hard on the abortion issue.
[01:06:47.426 --> 01:06:51.050]  And there's a big debate now even amongst the right wing.
[01:06:51.210 --> 01:06:54.634]  Do you lean in on the pro-life issue ahead of the election?
[01:06:54.654 --> 01:07:03.062]  Do you take a step back and say this could cost us politically?
[01:07:04.318 --> 01:07:07.319]  I see the arguments on both sides, but we'll get into that.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.781]  The economy, however, Joe Biden is losing on badly.
[01:07:12.061 --> 01:07:12.401]  Badly.
[01:07:12.441 --> 01:07:15.043]  And no matter where you look, it's not good.
[01:07:15.103 --> 01:07:21.505]  And there's no amount of lying that the Democrats and the media can engage in to try to cover this up.
[01:07:21.545 --> 01:07:22.046]  It's all over.
[01:07:22.346 --> 01:07:26.948]  Biden pays the price for causing runaway inflation as Americans are buried in bills.
[01:07:28.055 --> 01:07:31.816]  And you have car repos and credit card debt at record highs.
[01:07:32.317 --> 01:07:35.278]  Inflation is hurting Biden's progress on the economy.
[01:07:37.179 --> 01:07:46.602]  The typical American household would need to spend $445 more a month to purchase the same goods and services than a year ago.
[01:07:46.742 --> 01:07:50.544]  And so this is stuff they can come out and say, oh, economy great, economy great.
[01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:55.591]  Best economy ever, Jack, but the average American sees their grocery bill.
[01:07:56.371 --> 01:08:05.754]  It's kind of like the other day when Janet Powell during an interview says, We think we're really strong economically and financially.
[01:08:05.794 --> 01:08:08.455]  The American people are doing really well.
[01:08:08.835 --> 01:08:11.756]  That this rat woman who puts a bowl on her head and cuts around it says,
[01:08:13.764 --> 01:08:17.546]  Oh, oh, and I guess, I guess people would say, oh, oh, she's right!
[01:08:18.346 --> 01:08:22.708]  Oh, the credit card debt, that's, oh, Janet, she's right!
[01:08:24.649 --> 01:08:25.770]  Janet Yellen is right!
[01:08:26.730 --> 01:08:27.731]  I am doing great!
[01:08:27.871 --> 01:08:30.372]  Sure, I live paycheck to paycheck and have more debt than I've ever had!
[01:08:31.493 --> 01:08:34.394]  So here's a CBS Money Watch report.
[01:08:35.695 --> 01:08:38.556]  CBS Mainstream News, Norah O'Donnell.
[01:08:38.596 --> 01:08:40.257]  Here's them breaking down some of the numbers.
[01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:45.556]  For the third straight month, prices have gone up more than expected.
[01:08:45.936 --> 01:08:49.002]  From the rising cost of car insurance and repairs.
[01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:51.726]  To how much you're paying at the grocery store every week.
[01:08:52.407 --> 01:08:53.790]  Do you know how much one of these costs?
[01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:56.242]  Two freaking dollars!
[01:08:58.743 --> 01:08:59.164]  This was $200.
[01:08:59.824 --> 01:09:03.726]  We're supposed to skip the power bill this month so we can buy groceries or the mortgage.
[01:09:04.267 --> 01:09:09.910]  Before the pandemic, all of these groceries, about 30 items, cost $100 on average.
[01:09:10.310 --> 01:09:20.056]  Now, five years later, according to Nielsen IQ, all this costs 33% more, meaning you'd have to skip about 10 items, like chickens.
[01:09:20.476 --> 01:09:25.838]  Bread, milk, and bananas to make your $100 budget.
[01:09:26.719 --> 01:09:33.282]  Now look, to blame this on COVID is obviously not accurate, disingenuous.
[01:09:34.822 --> 01:09:40.124]  Now, if you're gonna try to tie it to COVID, then you tie it to the lockdown.
[01:09:40.165 --> 01:09:43.146]  You tie it to the policy that caused this.
[01:09:44.608 --> 01:09:45.689]  But really, that's not even it.
[01:09:46.089 --> 01:09:47.090]  It's the Biden economy.
[01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:48.091]  It's the Biden policies.
[01:09:48.151 --> 01:09:49.552]  It's the energy prices going up.
[01:09:49.612 --> 01:09:50.713]  It's the taxes going up.
[01:09:52.635 --> 01:09:53.956]  That's the policy that caused this.
[01:09:54.176 --> 01:10:01.222]  And there might be some residuals from the lockdown policies, but that's not what's causing this.
[01:10:01.462 --> 01:10:03.704]  It's the energy policy.
[01:10:03.844 --> 01:10:04.925]  It's the tax policy.
[01:10:05.165 --> 01:10:05.926]  That's what's going on.
[01:10:08.462 --> 01:10:15.825]  But again, Janet Yellen or Joe Biden or Kareem Jean-Pierre just say, the economy's great, greatest economy ever, Jack.
[01:10:16.205 --> 01:10:21.167]  And so the American people are just supposed to look at their grocery bill that's gone up and their energy bill that's gone up.
[01:10:22.948 --> 01:10:24.708]  And they're just supposed to say, oh yeah, this isn't real.
[01:10:25.068 --> 01:10:25.869]  This doesn't exist.
[01:10:27.369 --> 01:10:30.330]  Joe Biden told me that my energy bill is cheaper even though it's up.
[01:10:31.351 --> 01:10:33.992]  Janet Yellen told me my grocery bill is cheaper even though it's up.
[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:41.443]  Green's Jean-Pierre said, I'm doing better economically than I've ever done, even though I'm living paycheck to paycheck and not sure I'm going to pay my bills next month.
[01:10:41.723 --> 01:10:43.824]  They said I'm doing great, so I trust them.
[01:10:44.124 --> 01:10:45.505]  Do people really live in that world?
[01:10:48.026 --> 01:10:48.826]  No, I don't think so.
[01:10:48.886 --> 01:10:49.667]  And here's proof.
[01:10:53.749 --> 01:10:57.971]  On MSNBC, Undecided Voters, here's what they had to say about Joe Biden.
[01:11:03.288 --> 01:11:04.289]  I want to show two more.
[01:11:04.589 --> 01:11:10.472]  The undecided voters were also asked how they think President Biden is doing on the economy.
[01:11:10.612 --> 01:11:12.033]  Take a listen.
[01:11:13.694 --> 01:11:16.115]  I think he's been absolutely disastrous for the economy.
[01:11:17.936 --> 01:11:18.416]  I agree.
[01:11:18.436 --> 01:11:24.240]  Raise your hand if you think President Trump's policies on the economy would be better for your family personally.
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:25.460]  Raise your hand.
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:27.722]  Alright, so that is everybody.
[01:11:28.182 --> 01:11:31.924]  President Biden argues that his economic record has been very good.
[01:11:32.444 --> 01:11:34.185]  I mean, my past performance of my 401k.
[01:11:34.705 --> 01:11:40.267]  I know it was post 2020 and everything kind of flipped around, but you can't blame everything on 2020 forever.
[01:11:54.093 --> 01:11:58.614]  We have areas here in Pennsylvania where it's just at a standstill right now.
[01:11:59.215 --> 01:12:08.557]  Things are supposed to be being built and the interest rates are just way too high for people to invest and start moving around.
[01:12:08.577 --> 01:12:16.960]  And Virginia, just staying with you, because Pennsylvania is near and dear to Joe Biden's heart, are there Biden policies that you would blame for the problem?
[01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:17.820]  And if so, what are they?
[01:12:18.308 --> 01:12:30.541]  The interest rate is so high right now and I know they're trying to cut the inflation down but like if nobody is building, no businesses are really coming to Pennsylvania right now to keep us moving forward.
[01:12:30.681 --> 01:12:34.826]  Even if you're trying to buy a house because I'm trying to become a first-time homebuyer.
[01:12:35.146 --> 01:12:36.848]  The prices are so high right now.
[01:12:37.228 --> 01:12:38.049]  It's just hard.
[01:12:38.589 --> 01:12:50.341]  Is there anything Joe Biden could do or say between now and the time you vote that would make you feel differently about feeling that his policies would not be as good for your family on the economy?
[01:12:50.701 --> 01:12:54.325]  Or have you pretty much decided that Trump's policies would be better for the economy?
[01:12:54.545 --> 01:12:59.449]  I mean, I feel like he doesn't even take accountability for what's, at all, with what's going on in the economy.
[01:12:59.469 --> 01:13:02.212]  Not even accountability, like he's in denial that it's happening.
[01:13:02.412 --> 01:13:16.865]  The point is Biden needs to hear the people, because when he's talking about the economy doing stellar, he's talking about the stock market, he's not looking at homelessness or joblessness, he's not thinking about how much it costs to go to the grocery store, and he's gaslighting literally everyone in the process.
[01:13:17.225 --> 01:13:19.347]  And Omar, you voted for Joe Biden last time, right?
[01:13:19.967 --> 01:13:20.448]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:21.969 --> 01:13:31.278]  Some really important and hard insights for the Biden campaign to hear there and hearing all that, you might think things are pretty bad for President Biden.
[01:13:31.318 --> 01:13:32.119]  That was not good.
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:35.622]  Yeah, no kidding, inflatable news host woman.
[01:13:38.986 --> 01:13:44.051]  So again, no matter how many times Joe Biden or Kamala Harris or
[01:13:46.124 --> 01:13:52.428]  Harinjean Pierre or Janet Yellen get in front of a camera and tell you the economy's great and tell you you're doing better than ever.
[01:13:53.029 --> 01:13:54.310]  It's not working.
[01:13:55.691 --> 01:14:03.496]  The average American can still look at their grocery bill, energy bill, price at the pump, whatever, and know that that's just an outrageous lie.
[01:14:05.017 --> 01:14:08.940]  And I think more so than just, you know, people are used to politicians lying.
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:15.124]  I think it's the... I mean, it's just so offensive.
[01:14:16.676 --> 01:14:17.977]  It's just an insult.
[01:14:19.759 --> 01:14:22.361]  Like you don't even know what you're experiencing.
[01:14:22.482 --> 01:14:24.343]  You don't even know what you're going through.
[01:14:24.383 --> 01:14:25.584]  You're too stupid.
[01:14:26.866 --> 01:14:29.568]  Cream Jean Pierre up there looking like a cabbage patch doll.
[01:14:29.688 --> 01:14:33.112]  She is the intellectual authority on your life.
[01:14:33.512 --> 01:14:36.295]  She knows better than you what you're going through.
[01:14:38.373 --> 01:14:44.318]  Joe Biden who shuffles around like a generation run one robotics android.
[01:14:44.338 --> 01:14:46.220]  I mean, this guy's just an embarrassment.
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:47.340]  We got more from Biden today.
[01:14:48.161 --> 01:14:54.386]  Do you want to see stiff-armed Joe Biden shuffling around the White House and then getting to the podium and reading off a script?
[01:14:54.827 --> 01:14:57.329]  And this guy's so out of touch, he just says it now.
[01:14:57.369 --> 01:14:58.730]  He's like, oh, where's my script?
[01:14:59.170 --> 01:15:00.812]  He literally says, where's my script?
[01:15:04.730 --> 01:15:12.698]  As he shovels around the White House lawn, and he has to have a Marine up there, pointing which way to go, because he doesn't even know where he is.
[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:17.762]  He wakes up at 11 with CPAP marks on his face.
[01:15:21.646 --> 01:15:23.188]  Or maybe it's a ball gag, I don't know.
[01:15:28.873 --> 01:15:29.714]  But looking forward,
[01:15:35.762 --> 01:15:50.068]  Look, the RNC with Laura Logan and Michael Whatley have already changed course to such a degree that I'm not trying to sell you false hope here, but let's just be honest about the situation.
[01:15:50.468 --> 01:16:02.953]  They're already getting record fundraising, and they're already getting bodies to polling locations, and they already know the hotspots where to go to, and they're already saying and doing the right things, and they're already doing voter registration drives.
[01:16:04.448 --> 01:16:14.233]  So it's like if Ronald McDaniel was, you know, 0 for 300 in a baseball season, we got a fresh season and right now the team's, the RNC's batting like 300, 400.
[01:16:15.453 --> 01:16:15.873]  Pretty good.
[01:16:16.173 --> 01:16:16.714]  Doing pretty well.
[01:16:16.754 --> 01:16:17.274]  Leading the league.
[01:16:20.115 --> 01:16:22.837]  But you have to understand, the Democrats have a major problem, folks.
[01:16:22.997 --> 01:16:24.057]  They don't have the votes.
[01:16:24.257 --> 01:16:25.358]  They don't have the support.
[01:16:25.618 --> 01:16:26.518]  Not for Joe Biden.
[01:16:26.898 --> 01:16:28.719]  So you gotta ask yourself, well what are they gonna do?
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:32.021]  They're not just gonna walk into this election and take a loss.
[01:16:35.578 --> 01:16:36.378]  So what are they going to do?
[01:16:39.539 --> 01:16:50.701]  What are the Democrats, what are these scum-sucking criminals, what is the biggest terrorist organization in the history of this country, the Democrat Party, going to do before the 2024 elections?
[01:16:51.121 --> 01:16:52.041]  Or on election night?
[01:16:52.141 --> 01:16:53.181]  What are they going to do?
[01:16:54.121 --> 01:16:56.602]  They're not just going to walk into this and take the L, folks.
[01:16:57.942 --> 01:16:59.122]  Please don't be that naive.
[01:17:00.442 --> 01:17:01.143]  And I know you're not.
[01:17:01.783 --> 01:17:03.203]  So what are they going to do?
[01:17:05.236 --> 01:17:07.478]  Now we've got more on shuffling, bumbling Joe.
[01:17:07.538 --> 01:17:08.399]  He's a total embarrassment.
[01:17:08.439 --> 01:17:11.121]  But you know, here's James O'Keefe with O'Keefe Media Group again.
[01:17:12.622 --> 01:17:13.403]  With R.L.
[01:17:14.323 --> 01:17:20.288]  Gizmo, Principal Economist, Real Estate Finance Section, Research and Statistics, Federal Reserve Board.
[01:17:20.628 --> 01:17:21.349]  Let's play some of this.
[01:17:21.389 --> 01:17:26.593]  So, you had the Fed actively trying to tank and sabotage Donald Trump.
[01:17:27.714 --> 01:17:30.616]  Now they're actively trying to prop Joe Biden up.
[01:17:31.157 --> 01:17:33.779]  So this is the latest from O'Keefe Media Group in clip one.
[01:17:34.991 --> 01:17:36.492]  So you write speeches for Powell?
[01:17:36.512 --> 01:17:38.173]  Do you deal with classified stuff?
[01:17:54.921 --> 01:17:56.322]  It's all classified, right?
[01:17:56.342 --> 01:17:58.583]  Quote, it's all classified.
[01:17:58.783 --> 01:18:00.283]  It's all classified, right?
[01:18:00.363 --> 01:18:01.624]  Trump is a crazy person.
[01:18:01.784 --> 01:18:02.604]  It's very clear.
[01:18:02.644 --> 01:18:03.745]  I mean, he's a dumb guy.
[01:18:03.785 --> 01:18:05.445]  Does he hate Trump?
[01:18:05.465 --> 01:18:06.486]  Like, is the feeling neutral?
[01:18:06.546 --> 01:18:07.226]  Of course, of course.
[01:18:07.266 --> 01:18:07.546]  Okay.
[01:18:07.586 --> 01:18:08.006]  Yeah.
[01:18:08.067 --> 01:18:08.967]  And Trump was president.
[01:18:09.007 --> 01:18:10.047]  He wanted to stimulate the economy.
[01:18:10.187 --> 01:18:10.608]  Right.
[01:18:10.908 --> 01:18:11.628]  But he wouldn't do it.
[01:18:12.568 --> 01:18:15.870]  And he started raising interest rates, doing the opposite that Trump wanted.
[01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:17.911]  So, I mean, so the feeling is this, that like,
[01:18:19.406 --> 01:18:22.447]  We don't want Trump to be in the clean government.
[01:18:22.567 --> 01:18:24.588]  Is there anything for the legacy?
[01:18:24.608 --> 01:18:33.092]  He wants to be remembered in history as somebody who held the line against things like Trump and somebody who helped the economy.
[01:18:44.737 --> 01:18:46.998]  Preserve his legacy as someone.
[01:18:47.378 --> 01:18:50.800]  Even though he's Republican on paper, Democrats don't want him.
[01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:53.221]  Yeah, because he's responsive.
[01:18:53.361 --> 01:18:58.803]  Under Powell, the Fed has changed to think about equity issues, like racial issues.
[01:18:59.744 --> 01:19:03.525]  Think about wealth inequality as part of the agenda.
[01:19:03.625 --> 01:19:05.066]  Think about climate change.
[01:19:05.186 --> 01:19:08.988]  Orel Hismov says, quote, people think conservatives are dumb.
[01:19:09.588 --> 01:19:11.369]  Some people would think they're dumb.
[01:19:11.389 --> 01:19:12.891]  Would they be discriminated against?
[01:19:13.011 --> 01:19:16.574]  I mean, it depends on how out there they are.
[01:19:17.174 --> 01:19:19.136]  Isn't it for the legacy?
[01:19:19.216 --> 01:19:23.319]  As somebody who held the line against Trump?
[01:19:35.942 --> 01:19:41.785]  In today's unpredictable world, it's all about being prepared for who knows what they have in store for the next pandemic.
[01:19:42.125 --> 01:19:55.113]  Our friends and supporters... So between this latest video with the Federal Reserve, this guy claiming they were trying to sabotage Trump, to the CIA contractor saying they tried to destroy Alex Jones, subpoenas need to fly.
[01:19:56.195 --> 01:20:08.005]  And I've looked at all the different commentary and it doesn't matter whether you believe these guys are just bloviating and making it up or whether you think they're being fully honest and they have this direct knowledge or direct involvement.
[01:20:08.685 --> 01:20:12.429]  Either way, they need to be testifying in front of Congress under oath.
[01:20:12.609 --> 01:20:13.169]  We need to know.
[01:20:14.150 --> 01:20:15.351]  We need to get down to the bottom of it.
[01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:21.296]  And that's what's so frustrating.
[01:20:25.216 --> 01:20:26.317]  That's what's so frustrating.
[01:20:27.577 --> 01:20:41.266]  And I believe there's a chance, there's a window of opportunity inside the Republican Party with the populist nationalist takeover of it politically.
[01:20:42.233 --> 01:20:50.256]  That maybe we can get some people in there that are serious, and maybe we can get kind of a beachhead in there that is serious, so we don't just have the beachhead of Donald Trump in the White House, but also in Congress.
[01:20:51.316 --> 01:20:53.977]  Because these people need to be testifying under oath.
[01:20:54.017 --> 01:20:54.858]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:20:55.178 --> 01:20:58.439]  But, of course, you still have Mitch McConnell in there sabotaging it while he's still around.
[01:20:59.639 --> 01:21:00.440]  Oh, he's resigning.
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:00.980]  No, he's not.
[01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:01.880]  He's a liar.
[01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:03.441]  He didn't resign from anything.
[01:21:03.701 --> 01:21:06.622]  He's still in there sabotaging Republicans in Congress.
[01:21:07.495 --> 01:21:11.417]  Senate GOP leadership urges Johnson to stand up to chaos caucus.
[01:21:12.197 --> 01:21:24.863]  So that's the Marjorie Taylor Greene's, that's the Matt Gaetz, that's the Freedom Caucus, who actually want to have results for the American people, who actually want to stop all the corruption and wasteful spending and everything else in DC.
[01:21:25.243 --> 01:21:27.864]  And Mitch McConnell calls up Mike Johnson and says, you need to stop it.
[01:21:28.045 --> 01:21:29.945]  You need to let this gravy train continue.
[01:21:30.866 --> 01:21:32.767]  And that's probably why Marjorie Taylor Greene
[01:21:34.056 --> 01:21:37.437]  Goes on TV and says, what dirt do they have on Mike Johnson?
[01:21:37.497 --> 01:21:38.437]  Is he being blackmailed?
[01:21:38.717 --> 01:21:40.357]  So it all starts to make more sense.
[01:21:43.318 --> 01:21:46.539]  Because I'd say, you know, Mike Johnson doesn't really seem like the type of guy that could be blackmailed.
[01:21:46.579 --> 01:21:48.739]  He doesn't seem like a controlled opposition.
[01:21:49.079 --> 01:21:52.900]  You know, otherwise he would have been the one that they were trying to force in immediately after the McCarthy ouster.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:56.201]  But he just kind of ended up being forced into the position.
[01:21:58.783 --> 01:22:02.245]  But then Marjorie Taylor Greene goes on TV and says, I think he could be blackmailed.
[01:22:02.385 --> 01:22:03.226]  What do they have on him?
[01:22:03.246 --> 01:22:08.449]  And I'm thinking, OK, well, maybe this is just political strategy to apply some pressure to get him to do the right thing.
[01:22:08.969 --> 01:22:09.870]  But then you read this.
[01:22:10.010 --> 01:22:16.053]  And so what's probably going on is Johnson is calling up these members or having talks with these members saying outrageous stuff.
[01:22:16.093 --> 01:22:19.095]  And they need to pass this bill and that spending bill and support this cause.
[01:22:19.496 --> 01:22:21.637]  And so Marjorie Taylor Greene is like, what the hell is going on?
[01:22:23.092 --> 01:22:24.172]  Are you blackmailed, dude?
[01:22:24.853 --> 01:22:26.833]  What do you mean you're coming to me saying we need to support Ukraine?
[01:22:26.853 --> 01:22:29.214]  What do you mean you're coming to me saying we need to give unlimited money to Israel?
[01:22:29.394 --> 01:22:32.115]  What do you mean you're coming to me and saying we need to sign this bill to open the border up?
[01:22:32.675 --> 01:22:33.796]  What the hell is going on here?
[01:22:34.856 --> 01:22:39.138]  And so it's Mitch McConnell calling Johnson and running the show.
[01:22:40.898 --> 01:22:41.738]  Is it blackmail?
[01:22:41.798 --> 01:22:42.959]  Is it just political influence?
[01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:48.501]  I don't think Mike Johnson is going to get another shot to be the Speaker, though, I'll tell you that.
[01:22:50.221 --> 01:22:51.842]  So he can run his course the rest of the way here.
[01:22:54.906 --> 01:22:55.807]  But that's probably it.
[01:22:56.387 --> 01:23:06.134]  Why isn't Mike Johnson getting on the phone to members of Congress to get subpoenas into any of these individuals James O'Keefe has captured on camera talking about corruption in D.C.?
[01:23:08.376 --> 01:23:09.737]  Troy Nels agrees!
[01:23:11.679 --> 01:23:17.323]  Gavin Oblenus needs to be subpoenaed and testify under oath in front of Congress.
[01:23:17.603 --> 01:23:18.584]  Where's Mike Johnson?
[01:23:21.826 --> 01:23:22.707]  Where's Mike Johnson?
[01:23:28.106 --> 01:23:29.127]  Alright, here's Joe Biden.
[01:23:30.608 --> 01:23:32.689]  We showed the video yesterday of him shuffling around.
[01:23:33.650 --> 01:23:40.394]  He has to have a Marine literally point him where to go and show him where he is and tell him who he is and, you know, let him know that he had his butt wiped.
[01:23:41.195 --> 01:23:42.155]  It's totally embarrassing.
[01:23:46.598 --> 01:23:47.159]  And so...
[01:23:51.155 --> 01:23:51.896]  Here's one clip.
[01:23:51.956 --> 01:23:57.861]  Here's Joe Biden admitting that he has a script and a list of who he's supposed to call on in clip six.
[01:24:01.864 --> 01:24:02.565]  Next question.
[01:24:02.645 --> 01:24:04.006]  Who do I call on next?
[01:24:04.026 --> 01:24:04.767]  Hang on a second.
[01:24:04.787 --> 01:24:05.628]  I got my list here.
[01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:08.390]  Hang on.
[01:24:08.931 --> 01:24:09.872]  I apologize.
[01:24:11.313 --> 01:24:12.274]  I really have AFP.
[01:24:15.198 --> 01:24:16.239]  And there's another video, too.
[01:24:16.279 --> 01:24:17.280]  I don't know what's going on.
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:20.042]  There's a bunch of videos that didn't make the list today, but there's another video, too.
[01:24:20.122 --> 01:24:24.706]  It's a zoomed-in shot, and he's stumbling, and you can see in it, because he's so cool.
[01:24:24.746 --> 01:24:25.547]  He wears the aviators.
[01:24:26.027 --> 01:24:27.368]  By the way, it's totally unclass.
[01:24:27.769 --> 01:24:28.829]  It's totally classless.
[01:24:28.869 --> 01:24:29.890]  It's totally unprofessional.
[01:24:32.132 --> 01:24:37.296]  But he's just cool Joe Biden, or he probably has something wrong with his eyes, and so he has to wear the aviators.
[01:24:38.938 --> 01:24:42.941]  But yeah, so you hear in the clip, he says, oh, I forgot what I'm doing, what I'm saying.
[01:24:42.961 --> 01:24:43.841]  Let me go to my script.
[01:24:44.696 --> 01:24:50.199]  And then he's, and you can see it in his aviators, he's literally reading off a script, folks.
[01:24:50.339 --> 01:24:52.220]  This is not an organic press conference.
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:56.122]  This is a scripted, controlled media event.
[01:24:58.644 --> 01:25:00.825]  And he has a, and he has, it's not just a list.
[01:25:00.885 --> 01:25:06.108]  He has a pre-scripted, who he's going to call on, what the question is going to be, and his answer.
[01:25:08.509 --> 01:25:12.231]  A fully scripted, it's just, it's a Hollywood movie at this point.
[01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:14.951]  It's not a press conference.
[01:25:16.033 --> 01:25:17.375]  It's a scripted TV show.
[01:25:23.184 --> 01:25:26.549]  But you know, maybe Kamala Harris can save face here for the administration.
[01:25:27.802 --> 01:25:32.805]  She was visiting an elementary school and addressing the issue of trans kids.
[01:25:33.566 --> 01:25:35.287]  Trans kids, the big Democrat issue.
[01:25:35.307 --> 01:25:40.510]  They love mangling little boys and girls and genital mutilation and, um, you know, whatever else they're into.
[01:25:41.210 --> 01:25:42.771]  And so here she is addressing that.
[01:25:42.831 --> 01:25:46.273]  Maybe she can save some face here for the embarrassment that is Joe Biden in clip 12.
[01:25:46.413 --> 01:25:47.894]  All right.
[01:25:48.114 --> 01:25:50.456]  Had it or hit it, book fans.
[01:25:51.116 --> 01:25:51.636]  Oh God.
[01:25:51.837 --> 01:25:54.158]  Had it, had it, had it, had it.
[01:25:55.228 --> 01:26:16.560]  Again, the idea that you would restrict information, and you know, the same people who are doing that are, you know, some of the same people who are denying our history, I mean, are trying to kind of just whitewash it, and it's, I think it's absolutely horrible.
[01:26:17.714 --> 01:26:28.565]  So, by the way, whenever somebody is addressing you with inflection like that, that means they're lacking in confidence, and they really have no idea what they're talking about, or they know they're just lying or wrong.
[01:26:30.151 --> 01:26:33.072]  When she's speaking with that inflection like Valley Girl thing.
[01:26:33.092 --> 01:26:38.654]  I mean this is a girl introduced by Montel Williams as an arm piece.
[01:26:39.054 --> 01:26:46.297]  This is a woman who got down on her knees for Willie Brown to get involved in politics and now here she is the Vice President talking like this?
[01:26:46.657 --> 01:26:49.218]  Because she doesn't like the book bands?
[01:26:50.198 --> 01:26:51.818]  And it's the same people?
[01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:55.820]  Totally unserious.
[01:26:56.601 --> 01:26:59.083]  But see, this is the games that they play.
[01:26:59.123 --> 01:27:00.425]  These are the word games that they play.
[01:27:01.205 --> 01:27:01.806]  Book bans.
[01:27:02.266 --> 01:27:02.967]  Okay, wait a second.
[01:27:04.328 --> 01:27:17.300]  If I bring a Playboy magazine, if I bring a Nudie magazine, and I start showing that to kindergartners, and the teacher says, hey, take that book out of here.
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:18.381]  Get that book out of the classroom.
[01:27:18.681 --> 01:27:19.702]  Is that a book ban?
[01:27:21.604 --> 01:27:22.385]  Is that a book ban?
[01:27:24.517 --> 01:27:27.219]  Well yeah, I guess by Kamala Harris' logic, that's a book ban.
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:27.860]  Hey!
[01:27:29.421 --> 01:27:31.783]  That guy's showing pornography to kindergarten boys!
[01:27:33.405 --> 01:27:33.505]  Oh!
[01:27:33.925 --> 01:27:35.747]  You're not gonna ban these books, are ya?
[01:27:37.748 --> 01:27:38.889]  But of course, that's what they're doing.
[01:27:38.929 --> 01:27:46.276]  They're introducing books that teach kids how to use sex toys and have anal sex and give blowjobs and masturbate.
[01:27:49.181 --> 01:27:55.986]  And they're introducing it at a younger and younger age, and people just show up, just sensible-minded people, common-sense people, and they say, hey, no, we're not gonna do that in the classrooms.
[01:27:56.006 --> 01:27:57.026]  They, oh my God, a book man!
[01:27:57.387 --> 01:27:58.007]  I mean, okay.
[01:27:58.788 --> 01:28:01.409]  Would you have the same logic to a rapist?
[01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:09.495]  A man raping a woman, and Kamala Harris, oh, you're gonna, hey, so a man is raping a woman in the streets,
[01:28:12.639 --> 01:28:16.402]  And a good citizen comes up, or a cop comes up, and stops that rape from happening.
[01:28:16.602 --> 01:28:17.442]  And here comes Kamala Harris.
[01:28:17.663 --> 01:28:20.345]  Hey, are you gonna stop that man's sexual freedom?
[01:28:22.847 --> 01:28:26.069]  Are you gonna stop that man's sexual expression?
[01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:32.054]  He is allowed to freely exercise his sexual freedom and sexual expression.
[01:28:32.134 --> 01:28:32.994]  Uh, ma'am, that's a rape.
[01:28:34.095 --> 01:28:34.876]  It's the same logic.
[01:28:36.195 --> 01:28:37.396]  No, rape is bad!
[01:28:38.157 --> 01:28:41.459]  No, showing kindergarten students porn is bad!
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:44.062]  Oh no, that's book banning!
[01:28:44.182 --> 01:28:45.983]  Oh no, that's sexual expression!
[01:28:48.205 --> 01:28:49.246]  This is what they're going with.
[01:28:49.626 --> 01:28:51.368]  Why do they love this trans issue so much?
[01:28:51.868 --> 01:28:53.169]  And they love this abortion issue.
[01:28:53.209 --> 01:28:54.690]  We're gonna get to the abortion issue too.
[01:28:55.051 --> 01:28:56.252]  This is actually a big one.

[01:29:58.983 --> 01:30:01.525]  It's been sold out for six months.
[01:30:02.186 --> 01:30:03.667]  It's our number two bestseller.
[01:30:03.787 --> 01:30:04.308]  It's X3.
[01:30:04.408 --> 01:30:11.674]  The highest quality, pure, deep earth crystal iodine you're going to find anywhere.
[01:30:12.034 --> 01:30:15.176]  With the two other types of iodine that are great for your body as well.
[01:30:15.577 --> 01:30:20.160]  So to make sure no matter what type of body type you have, whatever your physiology is, it will supercharge you.
[01:30:20.541 --> 01:30:21.822]  Look at this giant stack right here.
[01:30:22.442 --> 01:30:25.145]  I could talk for hours about this on air and I am planning to next week.
[01:30:25.905 --> 01:30:31.266]  But the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[01:30:31.626 --> 01:30:33.147]  And all iodine is not created equal.
[01:30:33.487 --> 01:30:38.688]  Most iodine is bound to other things in the environment, whether it's plants or animals you're eating, so you don't absorb it.
[01:30:38.988 --> 01:30:40.628]  This is pure, goes right into your cells.
[01:30:41.108 --> 01:30:43.469]  It is essential for all electrochemical activity.
[01:30:43.889 --> 01:30:48.110]  And despite the fact it's been sold out for six months, X3 is back in stock.
[01:30:48.490 --> 01:31:00.733]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[01:31:00.913 --> 01:31:01.253]  Thank you.
[01:31:01.473 --> 01:31:04.014]  And let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[01:31:04.074 --> 01:31:05.334]  I started taking that stuff.
[01:31:05.374 --> 01:31:08.575]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[01:31:08.675 --> 01:31:09.595]  When did you start taking it?
[01:31:09.875 --> 01:31:13.776]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[01:31:14.476 --> 01:31:17.179]  And I started eating a little better, but my blood pressure stayed high.
[01:31:17.199 --> 01:31:24.728]  And when I took the X2 iodine, after about three or four weeks, I think my body was detoxified of a bunch of metals and stuff that my body was storing.
[01:31:24.828 --> 01:31:27.050]  And my blood pressure came down to perfect level.
[01:31:27.430 --> 01:31:30.354]  And I tell people the only thing I did was X2 iodine.
[01:31:30.814 --> 01:31:44.681]  And even though I do think all your other products are good, I recommend to anybody that they start with X2 Iodine because it detoxifies your body and kind of kicks your natural DNA into full force.
[01:31:44.781 --> 01:31:48.243]  So, in my life, I found X2 Iodine to be best.
[01:31:48.703 --> 01:31:52.145]  I tried other Iodines and they didn't have the same effect.
[01:31:52.325 --> 01:31:54.767]  So, X2 Iodine, I really wanted to point that out.
[01:31:58.717 --> 01:32:05.180]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the globalist agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:19.427]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections, masqueradings, vaccines.
[01:32:19.587 --> 01:32:24.490]  It is so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives oblivious.
[01:32:25.888 --> 01:32:28.603]  And you realize, Akron's stop list, it equals death.
[01:32:30.250 --> 01:32:50.687]  But people are starting to really understand how serious things are, and that's a hard thing to do, because to wake up to a dystopian reality and realize that we're in the middle of a giant biological weapon war against humanity, and that there's mass sterilization that's already taking place, cutting off all the major energy sources, is really hard to deal with, but it's the reality.
[01:32:51.247 --> 01:32:55.411]  Facing it is our only chance to turn this around, because stuff's about to get really, really nasty.
[01:32:55.831 --> 01:32:56.472]  InfoWars.com.
[01:33:00.057 --> 01:33:04.138]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:33:04.658 --> 01:33:05.978]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:19.500]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:22.001]  stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[01:33:22.101 --> 01:33:25.301]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:25.561 --> 01:33:28.362]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:31.671 --> 01:33:33.252]  I got a couple guests coming up.
[01:33:33.272 --> 01:33:38.855]  We got Benny Johnson coming up and the Aussie Cossack coming up as well.
[01:33:38.875 --> 01:33:42.557]  And we're going to be talking about Julian Assange and some other issues.
[01:33:42.797 --> 01:33:47.380]  I almost want to open the phone lines to this abortion issue.
[01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:50.781]  And we knew that the Democrats were going to make this their big issue.
[01:33:50.802 --> 01:33:52.082]  They can't run on anything else.
[01:33:52.562 --> 01:34:00.827]  And abortion becomes a single issue, a single voter, a single issue voter issue where people only show up to vote for abortion.
[01:34:02.145 --> 01:34:03.745]  And that's a very real phenomenon.
[01:34:03.945 --> 01:34:05.426]  And it's obviously mostly women.
[01:34:06.486 --> 01:34:12.007]  And then some liberal men and some gay men that just think that it's a heroic act to go vote for abortion.
[01:34:12.667 --> 01:34:15.007]  And of course, just like everything else, it's all propaganda.
[01:34:15.107 --> 01:34:16.608]  But they're really pushing this hard.
[01:34:17.748 --> 01:34:20.048]  Joe Biden making this post today.
[01:34:20.948 --> 01:34:24.709]  Because of Donald Trump, millions of women lost the fundamental freedom to control their own bodies.
[01:34:25.089 --> 01:34:26.609]  I will fight like hell to get your freedom back.
[01:34:27.009 --> 01:34:30.030]  I'm just so sick of this crap.
[01:34:31.383 --> 01:34:33.984]  No matter where you stand on the abortion issue, this is just an outright lie.
[01:34:34.724 --> 01:34:36.885]  The Supreme Court made that decision.
[01:34:38.025 --> 01:34:41.587]  And it was going to be made whether Ruth Bader Ginsburg was on the Supreme Court or not.
[01:34:42.087 --> 01:34:45.828]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that the issue should go back to the states on abortion.
[01:34:46.208 --> 01:34:47.349]  Funny how liberals forget that.
[01:34:49.249 --> 01:34:55.151]  But to say that the fundamental freedom to control your body, I mean, it's just an outright misrepresentation.
[01:34:55.191 --> 01:34:56.292]  It's just an outright lie!
[01:34:57.759 --> 01:35:01.681]  These are the people that push masks and vaccines and mandate them.
[01:35:02.762 --> 01:35:04.423]  Talking about freedom to control your body.
[01:35:05.183 --> 01:35:09.566]  The freedom to control your body starts with consent to sex.
[01:35:10.626 --> 01:35:12.768]  And if you don't consent, it's called rape.
[01:35:14.789 --> 01:35:15.629]  Ask Bill Clinton.
[01:35:21.532 --> 01:35:24.174]  So no, that's your freedom to decide.
[01:35:24.674 --> 01:35:25.715]  Rape is illegal.
[01:35:28.134 --> 01:35:35.860]  I mean, hell, the Democrats teach your children how to use dildos and put them in all their orifices by the time they're in first grade, so I'm pretty sure they know how to get pregnant.
[01:35:39.322 --> 01:35:41.384]  So, no, this isn't the freedom to control your own body.
[01:35:41.444 --> 01:35:43.225]  You have the freedom to control your own body.
[01:35:46.868 --> 01:35:51.251]  I have the freedom, if I want, I can go stab myself in the leg with a knife right now.
[01:35:51.451 --> 01:35:52.973]  But, gee, I know what's going to happen.
[01:35:53.713 --> 01:35:54.594]  I might have to get stitches.
[01:35:56.104 --> 01:35:57.705]  Yeah, you can choose to have sex or not.
[01:35:57.745 --> 01:35:59.046]  If you have sex, you might get pregnant.
[01:36:01.327 --> 01:36:03.789]  So no, the freedom to control your body starts with consent.
[01:36:05.209 --> 01:36:06.370]  Rape is already a crime.
[01:36:08.071 --> 01:36:09.072]  So they just lie.
[01:36:09.132 --> 01:36:11.033]  It's just lie on propaganda.
[01:36:11.053 --> 01:36:14.455]  It's just a propaganda cake with the lies of icing on top.
[01:36:17.717 --> 01:36:17.857]  But
[01:36:22.162 --> 01:36:44.803]  This is a major political issue and you know I see both sides of this from a pure political pragmatic standpoint I would say probably good strategy to kind of back off of this but ahead of the 2024 election if you're Republicans or at least try to reshape the narrative because I mean the Democrats are telling you you're killing women literally so that's not really good
[01:36:46.385 --> 01:36:53.331]  But, obviously, the purists on the pro-life side are going to say, no, we're not going to give an inch on this issue.
[01:36:53.391 --> 01:36:54.772]  So I understand both sides.
[01:36:56.114 --> 01:36:57.255]  I understand both sides of this.
[01:36:58.636 --> 01:37:02.439]  And it's a fair debate to be had, but here's some of the response.
[01:37:02.759 --> 01:37:04.521]  So you have to wonder if it's all coincidental.
[01:37:04.781 --> 01:37:07.403]  But look, the results are already in.
[01:37:09.085 --> 01:37:12.268]  Politically speaking, on the ballot, when it went to the states,
[01:37:16.130 --> 01:37:26.534]  It's close, but you take a political hit really leaning on the pro-life issue for your 2024 election.
[01:37:27.895 --> 01:37:31.296]  Strategically, it's probably not going to render the best results.
[01:37:33.274 --> 01:37:36.636]  That's not to say we shouldn't be pro-life or protect the sanctity of life.
[01:37:37.017 --> 01:37:37.637]  Of course we should.
[01:37:38.558 --> 01:37:44.722]  I'm just saying, if you're talking from a raw, political, pragmatic standpoint, the results are already in, and the Democrats know it.
[01:37:44.802 --> 01:37:51.406]  And that's why they're leaning hard on this issue, and they're hoping to get the response from the Republicans that will hurt them in the 2024 election.
[01:37:52.647 --> 01:37:54.929]  So they leaked the Roe vs. Wade decision ahead of 2022.
[01:37:54.969 --> 01:37:55.449]  That hurt Republicans.
[01:37:58.157 --> 01:38:04.101]  When the ballot issues arose on many of the states, the pro-life issues lost in many states.
[01:38:04.121 --> 01:38:05.501]  Some they won, some they lost.
[01:38:06.402 --> 01:38:07.363]  It wasn't a mop-up.
[01:38:09.424 --> 01:38:17.209]  And now you have this decision in Arizona, it almost feels like it was done intentionally ahead of the 2024 election, so that the Democrats can use this and lean on this.
[01:38:17.509 --> 01:38:21.511]  So they're just going ape at the Arizona Capitol.
[01:38:22.132 --> 01:38:23.632]  Full-fledged meltdowns.
[01:38:25.113 --> 01:38:26.234]  So let's listen here.
[01:38:26.274 --> 01:38:27.535]  Listen to what they say here in clip three.
[01:38:30.023 --> 01:38:36.106]  So, they're in there saying you're killing women, you're killing black women.
[01:38:36.206 --> 01:38:36.566]  And, look!
[01:38:58.100 --> 01:39:00.380]  Folks, Democrat voters believe it!
[01:39:02.321 --> 01:39:03.661]  Democrat voters believe it!
[01:39:05.502 --> 01:39:09.302]  They really hear that crap and they go home and thinking, oh my god, Republicans want to kill black women.
[01:39:11.023 --> 01:39:12.003]  I know it's not true.
[01:39:12.103 --> 01:39:13.143]  You know it's not true.
[01:39:15.144 --> 01:39:18.044]  But Democrats believe it and they go vote like it's true.
[01:39:18.944 --> 01:39:20.405]  So you have to address this issue.
[01:39:20.745 --> 01:39:23.605]  I don't care where you stand on this.
[01:39:25.446 --> 01:39:26.666]  You have to address this issue.
[01:39:29.206 --> 01:39:34.509]  You cannot let the Democrats win and have people believing that Republicans want to kill black women.
[01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:39.953]  By the way, the most dangerous place for a black American is in the womb.
[01:39:42.233 --> 01:39:45.136]  So you see, you have to find ways to counter this narrative.
[01:39:45.176 --> 01:39:49.820]  You have to find ways of getting buzzwords and catchphrases and clips out to the public.
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:54.364]  That woman there screaming and shouting like a lunatic knows exactly what she's doing.
[01:39:54.684 --> 01:40:01.129]  She knows the cameras are rolling and so she says, you're trying to kill black women because she knows that's what's gonna stick.
[01:40:02.150 --> 01:40:09.617]  Here's more of them going crazy at the Capitol in response to the new ruling of the abortion ban in Arizona in clip four.

[01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:18.240]  Jay!
[01:40:18.260 --> 01:40:18.320]  Jay!
[01:40:18.340 --> 01:40:18.420]  Jay!
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:18.500]  Jay!
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:18.580]  Jay!
[01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:18.840]  Jay!
[01:40:18.860 --> 01:40:18.920]  Jay!
[01:40:18.941 --> 01:40:19.001]  Jay!
[01:40:19.021 --> 01:40:19.081]  Jay!
[01:40:19.101 --> 01:40:19.161]  Jay!
[01:40:19.181 --> 01:40:19.241]  Jay!
[01:40:19.261 --> 01:40:19.341]  Jay!
[01:40:19.621 --> 01:40:19.681]  Jay!
[01:40:19.701 --> 01:40:19.761]  Jay!
[01:40:19.781 --> 01:40:19.861]  Jay!
[01:40:19.881 --> 01:40:19.941]  Jay!
[01:40:19.981 --> 01:40:20.102]  Jay!
[01:40:20.442 --> 01:40:20.562]  Jay!
[01:40:20.582 --> 01:40:20.702]  Jay!
[01:40:20.722 --> 01:40:20.782]  Jay!
[01:40:20.902 --> 01:40:20.962]  Jay!
[01:40:20.982 --> 01:40:21.042]  Jay!
[01:40:21.163 --> 01:40:21.263]  Jay!
[01:40:21.283 --> 01:40:21.423]  Jay!
[01:40:21.443 --> 01:40:21.583]  Jay!
[01:40:21.603 --> 01:40:21.743]  Jay!
[01:40:21.763 --> 01:40:21.903]  Jay!
[01:40:21.923 --> 01:40:23.665]  Jay!
[01:40:23.685 --> 01:40:23.745]  Jay!
[01:40:23.765 --> 01:40:23.865]  Jay!
[01:40:23.885 --> 01:40:23.945]  Jay!
[01:40:23.965 --> 01:40:24.045]  Jay!
[01:40:24.065 --> 01:40:24.125]  Jay!
[01:40:24.145 --> 01:40:24.225]  Jay!
[01:40:24.245 --> 01:40:24.305]  Jay!
[01:40:24.325 --> 01:40:24.386]  Jay!
[01:40:24.406 --> 01:40:24.466]  Jay!
[01:40:24.486 --> 01:40:24.546]  Jay!
[01:40:24.566 --> 01:40:24.626]  Jay!
[01:40:24.646 --> 01:40:24.726]  Jay!
[01:40:24.746 --> 01:40:24.826]  Jay!
[01:40:24.846 --> 01:40:24.906]  Jay!
[01:40:24.926 --> 01:40:25.006]  Jay!
[01:40:25.026 --> 01:40:25.086]  Jay!
[01:40:25.126 --> 01:40:25.206]  Jay!
[01:40:25.226 --> 01:40:25.286]  Jay!
[01:40:25.326 --> 01:40:25.386]  Jay!
[01:40:25.406 --> 01:40:25.466]  Jay!
[01:40:25.487 --> 01:40:25.607]  Jay!
[01:40:25.627 --> 01:40:25.687]  Jay!
[01:40:25.707 --> 01:40:25.807]  Jay!
[01:40:26.187 --> 01:40:26.628]  Jay!
[01:40:26.648 --> 01:40:26.708]  Jay!
[01:40:26.728 --> 01:40:27.108]  Jay!
[01:40:27.694 --> 01:40:32.737]  Because you should be sitting here logically saying, well, this should be your response to the illegal immigration.
[01:40:33.197 --> 01:40:36.139]  This should be your response to the criminals being let back on the streets.
[01:40:36.419 --> 01:40:39.241]  This should be your response to what's going on in the economy.
[01:40:40.081 --> 01:40:43.703]  Those are real issues that affect every single American.
[01:40:44.464 --> 01:40:46.265]  That's what you should be chanting shame about.
[01:40:46.325 --> 01:40:47.606]  So why do they do it with abortion?
[01:40:49.327 --> 01:40:51.088]  Because it's all politics, folks.
[01:40:51.908 --> 01:40:52.889]  It's all politics.
[01:40:53.766 --> 01:41:02.874]  They know that this issue tugs at the heartstrings and they know that the average Democrat voter, specifically female, is dumb enough to believe their propaganda.
[01:41:02.974 --> 01:41:06.637]  And they will really think, I need to go vote or a Republican wants to kill me.
[01:41:08.507 --> 01:41:23.748]  When they sit there and they say, Republicans want to kill black women, a low IQ Democrat voter, same difference, low IQ voter, Democrat voter, it's the same thing, they will go to the polls, they will wake up on election day and they will think, I have to go vote because Republicans want to kill me.
[01:41:24.881 --> 01:41:26.402]  Because Republicans want me dead.
[01:41:26.602 --> 01:41:28.283]  They actually believe that.
[01:41:28.463 --> 01:41:30.184]  I know it makes no sense to you.
[01:41:30.844 --> 01:41:34.406]  I know it's total low IQ, brainwashed thinking.
[01:41:34.706 --> 01:41:37.408]  That's a real thing that we have to address and deal with.
[01:41:37.748 --> 01:41:38.509]  Very real.
[01:41:43.791 --> 01:41:45.893]  So how do the Republicans get this under control?
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:42:07.635]  You obviously, you can't give on the issue of abortion, but there has to be some strategy to not let this turn out in a single issue voter phenomenon that could cost the Republicans, because the Democrats are doing this because they know it plays, and they have nothing else to run on.
[01:42:09.810 --> 01:42:32.613]  So if I'm, I don't know if you back off the issue, I don't know if you try to reshape the narrative, I don't know how you try to counter this, but you can tell, and it's been going on, the Democrats are leaning in on this, they're going heavy on this, this is their big issue, and just, you're going to see the propaganda all day long, Republicans want to kill you, Republicans want you dead, Republicans want to deny you healthcare, I know all of it's lies, I know all of it's bullcrap, but that's what they're going to do.
[01:42:33.817 --> 01:42:43.366]  But I guess at some point you just kind of sit back and you say, well, these are the people that love chopping up little boys and girls when they're alive, or they love chopping them up when they're in the womb.
[01:42:43.626 --> 01:42:46.389]  So, what can you do for them anyway?
[01:42:46.429 --> 01:42:52.554]  If they're that committed to evil, then... I guess you just say, it is what it is.
[01:42:53.195 --> 01:42:55.757]  And these are demonic people that love destroying children's lives.
[01:42:55.797 --> 01:42:56.398]  So, there you go.
[01:42:58.729 --> 01:43:02.213]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[01:43:02.614 --> 01:43:09.623]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of, is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[01:43:09.803 --> 01:43:11.805]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[01:43:12.006 --> 01:43:13.047]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[01:43:13.067 --> 01:43:13.788]  He loved the idea.
[01:43:14.108 --> 01:43:17.629]  What would you call the debates and discussions about a pro-human future?
[01:43:17.649 --> 01:43:18.529]  Just Team Humanity?
[01:43:18.589 --> 01:43:19.470]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[01:43:19.630 --> 01:43:20.070]  Absolutely.
[01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:21.770]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[01:43:21.850 --> 01:43:25.292]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[01:43:25.512 --> 01:43:32.954]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to keep InfoWars on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[01:43:33.234 --> 01:43:44.962]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a revolution against the globalists, that it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[01:43:45.242 --> 01:43:46.563]  We're told humans are the problem.
[01:43:46.583 --> 01:43:47.564]  We're told we're killing the Earth.
[01:43:47.844 --> 01:43:52.127]  We're told all this garbage, so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[01:43:52.427 --> 01:43:53.127]  We're not going to do that.
[01:43:53.367 --> 01:43:58.030]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at InfoWarsTore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[01:43:59.212 --> 01:44:04.679]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:09.707]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[01:44:10.107 --> 01:44:14.493]  We finally have a limited run back in supply at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:44:15.915 --> 01:44:18.676]  So many people have serious issues.
[01:44:18.956 --> 01:44:20.076]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[01:44:20.516 --> 01:44:25.938]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[01:44:26.478 --> 01:44:31.880]  Most other iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[01:44:32.500 --> 01:44:35.261]  But this is pure atomic certified
[01:44:37.162 --> 01:44:38.483]  I don't know.
[01:44:58.764 --> 01:45:04.066]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing, high-quality coffee has not been available.
[01:45:04.527 --> 01:45:08.908]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[01:45:09.349 --> 01:45:11.810]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[01:45:12.370 --> 01:45:21.754]  But now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.
[01:45:21.954 --> 01:45:24.535]  It's powered by the company Minuteman Coffee.
[01:45:25.215 --> 01:45:33.243]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best-tasting, best-smelling, strongest coffee that I have ever drank.
[01:45:33.724 --> 01:45:35.105]  It is game-changing.
[01:45:35.566 --> 01:45:37.768]  All you gotta do is buy a bag of it and try it.
[01:45:37.828 --> 01:45:40.911]  I know you're gonna be hooked, which will then fund your Operation A360 win.
[01:45:41.171 --> 01:45:45.155]  Go to infowarstore.com right now for Escape the Prison Planet Light Roast.
[01:45:45.195 --> 01:45:48.659]  That's the strongest, the amazing, medium-roast wig of America.
[01:45:49.239 --> 01:46:02.888]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[01:46:02.908 --> 01:46:04.609]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:46:05.230 --> 01:46:08.272]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:46:09.152 --> 01:46:13.075]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[01:46:14.525 --> 01:46:17.228]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:46:18.069 --> 01:46:25.898]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:46:26.879 --> 01:46:29.762]  So from myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:46:29.782 --> 01:46:35.488]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:46:36.309 --> 01:46:37.229]  I know you spread the word.
[01:46:37.249 --> 01:46:38.730]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[01:46:38.770 --> 01:46:39.290]  Keep doing it.
[01:46:39.330 --> 01:46:47.634]  But most viewers and listeners never go to infowarstore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keeping us on air.
[01:46:48.274 --> 01:46:51.915]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at infowarstore.com.
[01:46:52.576 --> 01:46:57.197]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to infowarstore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[01:46:57.538 --> 01:46:58.298]  Please take action now.
[01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:04.135]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:47:04.657 --> 01:47:05.962]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:47:31.442 --> 01:47:35.985]  You know, maybe I'll take some calls on the abortion issue in the fourth hour.
[01:47:37.747 --> 01:47:51.396]  We will be hearing from Alex in the fourth hour as well, but I'm going to be here for the first half of the fourth hour, and then Alex is going to be here for the second half with Steve Bannon and Crowder.
[01:47:53.458 --> 01:47:58.742]  But maybe we'll do something on that issue to see where you stand, because I see it from both sides.
[01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:02.241]  I see it from both sides.
[01:48:04.163 --> 01:48:10.610]  And I'm unequivocally pro-life, but I also practice what I preach.
[01:48:10.730 --> 01:48:21.441]  You have to separate sometimes politics and culture, and you have to understand that political purism is a cancer to any political movement.
[01:48:22.864 --> 01:48:31.951]  So would you rather have the Democrats running the country and destroying it, or would you rather give an inch or two on the abortion issue, if not just momentarily, to get back into office?
[01:48:32.832 --> 01:48:34.953]  I guess that's the question.
[01:48:36.274 --> 01:48:39.657]  Let's hit some other odds and ends here before we're joined by Benny Johnson coming up here.
[01:48:41.839 --> 01:48:45.882]  Viva Free breaks it down.
[01:48:45.942 --> 01:48:46.703]  This is incredible.
[01:48:47.743 --> 01:48:50.906]  It's amazing to appreciate who the players and the Trump
[01:48:52.281 --> 01:48:55.323]  The Players in the Trump Persecutions.
[01:48:55.343 --> 01:48:55.323]  1.
[01:48:55.663 --> 01:49:03.148]  Stormy Daniels, a adult actress.
[01:49:03.168 --> 01:49:03.148]  2.
[01:49:03.268 --> 01:49:04.869]  Convicted perjurer Michael Cohen.
[01:49:05.850 --> 01:49:04.869]  3.
[01:49:05.950 --> 01:49:08.251]  Convicted extortionist Michael Avenatti.
[01:49:09.052 --> 01:49:08.251]  4.
[01:49:09.232 --> 01:49:12.554]  Adulterer and perjurer Fannie Willis.
[01:49:12.574 --> 01:49:12.554]  5.
[01:49:12.694 --> 01:49:15.175]  Adulterer and divorce fraudster Nathan Wade.
[01:49:16.937 --> 01:49:15.175]  6.
[01:49:17.137 --> 01:49:20.139]  Corrupt pervert judge, nipple judge Arthur Engeron.
[01:49:21.629 --> 01:49:25.230]  He likes to take pictures of himself naked at the gym.
[01:49:26.370 --> 01:49:28.831]  Looks pretty good for an old man, but that's what he's into.
[01:49:29.411 --> 01:49:33.492]  Corrupt judge with family ties to prosecution Juan Merchan.
[01:49:33.512 --> 01:49:36.373]  Yeah, family gets paid millions of dollars by the Democrats.
[01:49:36.393 --> 01:49:36.373]  8.
[01:49:38.733 --> 01:49:44.394]  Crazy old pervert who fantasizes about raped and named her cat Vagina Fireball, E. Jean Carroll.
[01:49:45.795 --> 01:49:44.394]  9.
[01:49:45.855 --> 01:49:50.576]  Prosecutor who has been credibly accused of international extortion schemes, Jack Smith.
[01:49:52.004 --> 01:50:00.393]  10 corrupt Soros-funded prosecutor Alvin Bragg and 11 corrupt prosecutor who campaigned off targeting Trump, Letitia James and Fannie Willis.
[01:50:01.434 --> 01:50:06.259]  If you don't understand that the criminals are in charge, you are a moron and a Democrat.
[01:50:06.299 --> 01:50:08.121]  But those two words are now synonyms.
[01:50:10.264 --> 01:50:12.726]  And I keep seeing this Stormy Daniels thing gets brought up.
[01:50:12.826 --> 01:50:14.328]  But see, this is what I talk about.
[01:50:17.020 --> 01:50:32.104]  Until you've been in that courtroom or you've faced Democrats that have the power, you realize, folks, real quick, in a real harsh way, that truth doesn't matter, evidence doesn't matter, and justice never entered the equation with these people.
[01:50:33.364 --> 01:50:42.827]  So just remember, when you hear all this crap about Stormy Daniels and the hush money, Stormy Daniels signed a document in 2018
[01:50:47.950 --> 01:50:51.514]  Stating, official statement of Stormy Daniels.
[01:50:52.775 --> 01:51:01.123]  To whom it may concern, over the past few weeks I have been asked countless times to comment on reports of an alleged sexual relationship I had with Donald Trump many, many, many years ago.
[01:51:01.603 --> 01:51:07.509]  The fact of the matter is that each party to this alleged affair denied its existence in 2006, 2011, 2016, 2017, and now again in 2018.
[01:51:14.096 --> 01:51:22.083]  I'm not denying this affair because I was paid hush money, as it has been reported in overseas-owned tabloids.
[01:51:22.203 --> 01:51:24.805]  I'm denying this affair because it never happened.
[01:51:25.625 --> 01:51:28.128]  I will have no further comment on this matter.
[01:51:29.869 --> 01:51:31.170]  And then plugs her Instagram account.
[01:51:31.330 --> 01:51:33.572]  Signed, Stormy Daniels.
[01:51:36.074 --> 01:51:36.815]  Now, does that matter?
[01:51:37.095 --> 01:51:38.176]  No!
[01:51:39.697 --> 01:51:41.859]  Does E. Jean Carroll fantasizing about rape?
[01:51:43.397 --> 01:51:43.957]  On air?
[01:51:44.417 --> 01:51:46.778]  And then bragging about how she's going to spend the Trump money?
[01:51:46.998 --> 01:51:47.638]  Does that matter?
[01:51:47.918 --> 01:51:49.079]  No!
[01:51:49.099 --> 01:51:56.681]  Does Lechita James running for office saying, elect me and I'll go get Donald Trump, does that matter?
[01:51:56.701 --> 01:51:56.741]  No!
[01:51:57.481 --> 01:52:02.083]  Does the fact that known liars and criminals are the ones going after Donald Trump matter?
[01:52:02.523 --> 01:52:03.583]  No!
[01:52:03.603 --> 01:52:10.645]  Does the fact that a judge in one of the Trump cases, his family is getting paid millions of dollars by the Democrats matter?
[01:52:11.206 --> 01:52:11.746]  No!
[01:52:12.941 --> 01:52:20.582]  Ladies and gentlemen, you have to understand, these people do not care.
[01:52:21.122 --> 01:52:22.723]  They are committed to evil.
[01:52:22.963 --> 01:52:26.223]  They have made the decision to be the bad guy.
[01:52:26.443 --> 01:52:28.224]  They have embraced their role.
[01:52:28.584 --> 01:52:30.984]  They hate you!
[01:52:32.664 --> 01:52:41.386]  Truth, evidence, justice, it doesn't just not stand in their way, it doesn't even exist in their equation!
[01:52:50.146 --> 01:52:54.069]  And, you know, some liberals and Democrats are starting to get this, and they don't want to be a part of it.
[01:52:54.309 --> 01:52:55.310]  They don't want to be the bad guy.
[01:52:55.390 --> 01:52:57.572]  They don't want to be the reasons why the country collapses.
[01:52:58.192 --> 01:53:03.056]  They're not evil people, like Tulsi Gabbard, who writes a book saying, to save the country, leave the Democrat Party.
[01:53:03.277 --> 01:53:04.358]  Tulsi Gabbard gets it.
[01:53:05.659 --> 01:53:09.482]  Only two things exist, or only one of these two things exists by the year 2030.
[01:53:10.142 --> 01:53:13.845]  Only one of these two things exists by the year 2030.
[01:53:14.586 --> 01:53:17.709]  Either the United States of America, or the Democrat Party.
[01:53:19.096 --> 01:53:21.297]  Which one, American citizen?
[01:53:21.597 --> 01:53:22.098]  Which one?
[01:53:23.258 --> 01:53:27.821]  By the year 2030, only one of them will exist.
[01:53:27.941 --> 01:53:30.042]  The Democrat Party or the United States of America.
[01:53:30.382 --> 01:53:32.263]  These two things cannot coexist.
[01:53:35.124 --> 01:53:38.006]  Here's a former NPR guy, worked there for decades.
[01:53:39.847 --> 01:53:41.448]  I've been at NPR for 25 years.
[01:53:41.628 --> 01:53:43.429]  Here's how we lost America's trust.
[01:53:45.965 --> 01:53:54.009]  Yuri Berliner, a veteran at the Public Radio Institution, should be shut down, says the network lost its way when it started telling listeners how to think.
[01:53:54.029 --> 01:53:54.869]  Well, yeah, it's all liberals.
[01:53:56.090 --> 01:53:57.130]  It's all liberals.
[01:54:03.073 --> 01:54:05.574]  You cannot get a job at NPR unless you're a liberal.
[01:54:06.234 --> 01:54:13.818]  It's all anti-Trump, it's all leftist bent, and they have this phony like, oh, we're just reporting the news, we're just neutral, we just read the news and the facts.
[01:54:13.958 --> 01:54:14.538]  No, you don't!
[01:54:15.540 --> 01:54:21.545]  You're totally Democrat run, you're totally leftist liberal mindset, you're totally brainwashing propaganda now.
[01:54:21.565 --> 01:54:26.330]  Yeah.
[01:54:27.511 --> 01:54:28.011]  Exactly.
[01:54:28.952 --> 01:54:35.358]  You're not getting information if you listen to NPR, you're getting misinformation and disinformation.
[01:54:36.959 --> 01:54:39.621]  But you know, it's almost like we have to give up and abandon those terms.
[01:54:40.427 --> 01:54:44.569]  Because the Democrats love using misinformation, disinformation.
[01:54:44.609 --> 01:54:49.912]  Well, to a Democrat, to a liberal, what does misinformation, what does disinformation really mean?
[01:54:50.232 --> 01:54:51.253]  Truth that they don't like.
[01:54:52.473 --> 01:54:53.734]  Facts that they don't want you to see.
[01:54:53.754 --> 01:54:58.737]  So it's like, do we try to push back and...
[01:55:00.507 --> 01:55:03.548]  Really address what misinformation and disinformation is?
[01:55:03.989 --> 01:55:14.693]  Or do we explain that, okay, when you see them using the terms misinformation and disinformation, you need to understand that's just facts, evidence that the Democrats don't like and don't want you to see.
[01:55:14.713 --> 01:55:20.536]  You gotta, these are the decisions you gotta make here.
[01:55:28.404 --> 01:55:29.604]  So much more is going on.
[01:55:30.265 --> 01:55:32.406]  This Biden administration is such a disaster.
[01:55:34.386 --> 01:55:41.009]  So you have Russia basically blaming America for what's going down in Ukraine and in Moscow.
[01:55:41.109 --> 01:55:46.491]  You have the Arab world basically blaming America for what's going down with Israel and the Gaza Strip.
[01:55:47.192 --> 01:55:50.753]  And it's just not good, folks.
[01:55:53.402 --> 01:55:55.183]  Iran has told the White House that if the U.S.
[01:55:55.223 --> 01:55:59.806]  defends Israel against its forthcoming retaliation for the Damascus strike, it will consider the U.S.
[01:55:59.846 --> 01:56:00.967]  a viable target as well.
[01:56:01.187 --> 01:56:04.389]  Well, we have a wide-open southern border, so you might think that's a problem.
[01:56:05.130 --> 01:56:07.931]  And then what is Newsmax doing here, going pro-Ukraine?
[01:56:08.452 --> 01:56:10.873]  Ten reasons why Ukraine aid is good for America.
[01:56:10.893 --> 01:56:11.974]  Did somebody pay for that?
[01:56:11.994 --> 01:56:15.757]  Was it the same people that wrote this Defense.gov story?
[01:56:15.797 --> 01:56:18.839]  Supporting Ukraine also serves U.S.
[01:56:18.899 --> 01:56:19.279]  interests?
[01:56:22.429 --> 01:56:24.730]  Oh yeah, the interest of Washington D.C.
[01:56:24.810 --> 01:56:25.210]  certainly.
[01:56:26.771 --> 01:56:31.252]  The interest of the military industrial complex and all its shareholders in D.C.
[01:56:31.292 --> 01:56:32.433]  like Dan Crenshaw, I'm sure.
[01:56:33.393 --> 01:56:35.334]  I'm sure it does just fine there.
[01:56:35.354 --> 01:56:38.695]  No, no, no.
[01:56:38.775 --> 01:56:44.537]  Dan Crenshaw, he made a bunch of money with his $174,000 a year salary.
[01:56:44.577 --> 01:56:46.258]  He made his millions legitimately.
[01:56:48.479 --> 01:56:51.000]  He beat Wall Street legitimately.
[01:56:53.959 --> 01:56:54.840]  So don't worry about that.
[01:56:57.501 --> 01:56:58.461]  And he really means it.
[01:56:58.522 --> 01:56:59.462]  He really means it.
[01:57:00.102 --> 01:57:02.464]  I mean, at least Crenshaw has been in the military.
[01:57:02.984 --> 01:57:05.045]  So I mean, maybe he will go fight in Ukraine.
[01:57:05.065 --> 01:57:06.946]  Or maybe he will go fight for Israel.
[01:57:09.728 --> 01:57:11.388]  So I guess he's got that instead of like this...
[01:57:12.847 --> 01:57:13.948]  Pinko Lindsey Graham.
[01:57:14.028 --> 01:57:16.089]  Alright, we're about to be joined by Benny Johnson here coming up.
[01:57:16.189 --> 01:57:24.373]  Ladies and gentlemen, remember to support us at InfoWarsTore.com so we can continue to have these live transmissions every day, bring on the great guests every day, InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:57:24.714 --> 01:57:28.456]  You know, Biden might just collapse the economy, he might just collapse everything, the power grid, who knows.
[01:57:28.736 --> 01:57:30.077]  So you might want to have some storable food.
[01:57:30.477 --> 01:57:35.860]  Seriously, it's insurance you can eat, and obviously you'd rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it.
[01:57:36.806 --> 01:57:40.590]  But Biden collapsing things is a very real threat, so have insurance you can eat.
[01:57:40.630 --> 01:57:45.274]  We have the highest quality storable foods, ready to store, ready to ship at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:57:49.358 --> 01:58:00.689]  There is nothing more frustrating to me, whether it comes to news or anything else we're doing, than to know I'm telling the truth and to know they'll just listen to me and take action.
[01:58:01.149 --> 01:58:01.950]  It will change your life.
[01:58:02.802 --> 01:58:06.185]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have two great products that have been sold out for a long time.
[01:58:06.545 --> 01:58:09.308]  They're now back in stock at InfowarStore.com.
[01:58:09.888 --> 01:58:13.332]  X3 is the highest quality iodine, the missing link.
[01:58:13.812 --> 01:58:15.734]  It is back in stock, 40% off.
[01:58:15.894 --> 01:58:21.439]  And so is TurboForce, 10-hour clean energy, naturally released.
[01:58:21.639 --> 01:58:22.400]  It is amazing.
[01:58:22.820 --> 01:58:25.062]  Both of these products fund the Infowar.
[01:58:25.643 --> 01:58:28.245]  So they could be placebo and it'd still be great if they fund the Infowar.
[01:58:28.545 --> 01:58:28.966]  They're not.
[01:58:29.586 --> 01:58:32.530]  If you'll just try TurboForce, you'll see the results in 30 minutes.
[01:58:32.830 --> 01:58:35.173]  Incredible energy for 10 hours without the letdown.
[01:58:35.534 --> 01:58:41.301]  But if you will just take X3 on average for about two weeks, you will see amazing results because it's the missing link.
[01:58:41.962 --> 01:58:48.089]  X3 and TurboForce, both discounted now for a limited time at Infolwerestore.com.
[01:58:55.109 --> 01:58:56.050]  Please support us.
[01:58:56.110 --> 01:58:56.611]  Get a book.
[01:58:56.671 --> 01:58:57.191]  Get a film.

[01:59:03.498 --> 01:59:06.041]  InfoWarStore.com.
[01:59:06.161 --> 01:59:07.362]  Get TurboForce.
[01:59:07.483 --> 01:59:09.184]  Get Next Level Foundational Energy.
[01:59:09.224 --> 01:59:11.187]  They're all incredible products.
[01:59:12.591 --> 01:59:15.693]  Next Level Foundational Energy is about to sell out, but it's not a stimulant.
[01:59:15.753 --> 01:59:17.133]  No, it's the energy of the cells.
[01:59:17.173 --> 01:59:18.074]  Different level energy.
[01:59:18.374 --> 01:59:19.214]  That's why it's Next Level.
[01:59:19.594 --> 01:59:21.475]  That's why TurboForce is today our clean energy.
[01:59:21.515 --> 01:59:24.337]  It is a bunch of stimulants that are natural and good, with a good letdown.
[01:59:25.057 --> 01:59:25.497]  Amazing.
[01:59:25.837 --> 01:59:26.718]  TurboForce.
[01:59:26.758 --> 01:59:27.818]  Next Level Foundational Energy.
[01:59:28.599 --> 01:59:29.459]  You clean out your blood.
[01:59:29.659 --> 01:59:31.660]  Everybody should be on now.
[01:59:33.281 --> 01:59:34.061]  NitricBoost.
[01:59:34.462 --> 01:59:36.983]  InfoWarStore.com.
[01:59:37.123 --> 01:59:37.823]  NitricBoost.
[01:59:38.504 --> 01:59:39.464]  We're funded by the people.
[01:59:39.564 --> 01:59:40.264]  Thanks for your support.
[01:59:40.545 --> 01:59:41.045]  We'll be right back.
[01:59:42.628 --> 01:59:44.109]  We need to prosecute Anthony Fauci.
[02:00:04.321 --> 02:00:05.862]  If we don't, we have nothing.
[02:00:05.902 --> 02:00:07.582]  Here's Rand Paul explaining why.
[02:00:07.622 --> 02:00:20.486]  For the first several months, and really for years, has tried to call anybody who believes that it came from the lab or looks at evidence that the virus came from this lab, calls them conspiracy theorists, downplays them, denigrates them.
[02:00:20.846 --> 02:00:31.270]  He promoted journal articles to downplay and say it wasn't possible, when all the while it looks like he knew it, Peter Daszak knew it, Ralph Baric at UNC knew it.
[02:00:31.670 --> 02:00:32.270]  He knew about it.
[02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:33.511]  He was part of the project.
[02:00:33.751 --> 02:00:36.151]  And yet he comes to the White House and says nothing about it.
[02:00:36.531 --> 02:00:46.794]  This would have warned us that this virus wasn't attempting to make a clumsy leap from animals to human, but was already pre-adapted and was going to be incredibly infectious to humans.
[02:00:47.114 --> 02:00:49.495]  That happens not typically with an animal virus.
[02:00:49.855 --> 02:00:52.896]  It happens with mutations that are forced in a lab.
[02:00:53.676 --> 02:01:02.305]  And as you point out, Senator, every time Anthony Fauci has come before Congress, whether it be the House or the Senate, his line has always been the same, and it sounds like this.
[02:01:04.227 --> 02:01:18.353]  I will repeat again, the NIH and NIAID categorically has not funded gain-of-function research to be conducted in the Wuhan Institute of Iran.
[02:01:18.473 --> 02:01:24.295]  Yet you say, that was you questioning him there as you have so many times, you say it's impossible that he didn't know about this?
[02:01:25.441 --> 02:01:29.843]  Yeah, without question they did fund gain-of-function research in Wuhan, so that's a lie.
[02:01:30.283 --> 02:01:43.149]  But also we now know, and what we're revealing today, is that he knew about the specific project to put a furin cleavage site with Peter Daszak, Ralph Baric, and the Wuhan Institute to create a virus that was more infectious to humans.
[02:01:43.449 --> 02:01:53.233]  He knew about it because not only was his team being briefed about it, we now have documented evidence they were briefed, we also have documented evidence that they were partners in this.
[02:01:53.693 --> 02:02:01.078]  The actual original proposal with Wuhan involved the NIH and the Rocky Mountain Lab that is owned by NAID.
[02:02:01.458 --> 02:02:08.823]  So Fauci was intimately an integral part of all of this and yet he continues to get away with saying, I knew nothing.
[02:02:09.083 --> 02:02:19.409]  But we now have the documented evidence that his team was briefed and that they were actually an intimate part of the proposal to create a virus that looks like COVID-19.
[02:02:20.424 --> 02:02:30.148]  You know, as you pointed out a moment ago, Senator, that anybody who talked about a lab leak theory in the early going of COVID was dismissed as a tinfoil hat-wearing conspiracy theorist.
[02:02:30.568 --> 02:02:33.369]  But now we have an editor at NPR.
[02:02:33.829 --> 02:02:35.430]  He's been there for 25 years.
[02:02:35.470 --> 02:02:36.830]  His name is Yuri Berliner.
[02:02:37.251 --> 02:02:47.394]  Wrote a very long op-ed in the free press about all of the times when politics has interceded in the reporting of actual journalistic items.
[02:02:48.835 --> 02:02:52.178]  And this is what he said about coverage of the lab leak theory.
[02:02:52.198 --> 02:02:53.459]  He said, What do you say when you hear that?
[02:03:17.262 --> 02:03:18.282]  So disappointing.
[02:03:18.382 --> 02:03:25.465]  You know, the media is supposed to be equal opportunities of going after both parties, all ideas, all issues, looking for the truth.
[02:03:26.005 --> 02:03:28.126]  Look at the reporters that have uncovered this.
[02:03:28.206 --> 02:03:30.066]  Most of them, they'll tell you, they came from the left.
[02:03:30.387 --> 02:03:37.289]  Matt Taibbi, Michael Schellenberger, they'll say they're either moderate or democrat or even from the left, and they had the honesty to do it.
[02:03:37.329 --> 02:03:40.130]  So there were some honest journalists that have gone after the story.
[02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:52.095]  But the institutional forces, and this is the real danger of letting the FBI and Homeland Security, letting them work together to persuade, cajole, and coerce media to do their bidding.
[02:03:52.575 --> 02:03:57.877]  The media needs to be independent of government, and I don't care whether it's right, left, or in between, what the direction is.
[02:03:58.217 --> 02:04:00.698]  You have to have an independent media that is critical.
[02:04:01.078 --> 02:04:10.440]  And during COVID, what we found is you had the media and the powers that be working collectively with the government and the FBI sitting down.
[02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:20.563]  Can you imagine if after our interview right now, the FBI called you up and wanted to sit down with you and said, well, part of the interview is good, but we want to remove this one question because we think that's disinformation.
[02:04:21.043 --> 02:04:23.244]  Nobody in broadcast TV would tolerate that.
[02:04:23.584 --> 02:04:24.845]  But that's what they were doing.
[02:04:24.885 --> 02:04:30.970]  They were sitting these people down and saying, we don't like that question, we don't like the way they answered it, and we want it struck in from the record.
[02:04:31.050 --> 02:04:32.771]  Struck in from the public record.
[02:04:33.252 --> 02:04:36.414]  It's mortifying to think of this kind of government power.
[02:04:36.474 --> 02:04:37.655]  Alright, we're about to come back here.
[02:04:37.695 --> 02:04:41.959]  Benny Johnson is going to... Folks, this country is in such a dangerous state right now.
[02:04:42.599 --> 02:04:43.220]  Okay?
[02:04:44.176 --> 02:04:45.857]  The government weaponized against the people.
[02:04:46.738 --> 02:04:49.060]  Mad scientists like Fauci creating viruses.
[02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:52.662]  I mean, starting wars all across the planet.
[02:04:52.702 --> 02:04:53.403]  I mean, my God.

[02:05:13.094 --> 02:05:15.256]  And that's why we formulated Survival Shield X3.
[02:05:15.996 --> 02:05:16.616]  We're good to go!

[02:06:07.819 --> 02:06:08.700]  You found it.
[02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:10.521]  The tip of the spear.
[02:06:11.041 --> 02:06:15.823]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[02:06:15.843 --> 02:06:18.325]  We're now joined by Benny Johnson.
[02:06:18.525 --> 02:06:21.706]  And Benny, I guess you broke some pretty big news on your show the other day.
[02:06:21.726 --> 02:06:23.828]  Alex was your guest talking about...
[02:06:24.628 --> 02:06:42.861]  Going after these corrupt institutions, specifically when we look at that video from Sound Investigations, trying to find out what the CIA or the FBI or other institutions were doing to, quite frankly, illegally go after Alex Jones, violating his civil rights, I would say, his right to free speech.
[02:06:43.662 --> 02:06:46.164]  But I guess maybe the lawyers will have to get involved with that.
[02:06:46.224 --> 02:06:47.465]  Now it's national news.
[02:06:47.845 --> 02:06:53.129]  You have congressmen like Troy Nels going out and responding, encouraging Alex to do that.
[02:06:53.909 --> 02:06:57.630]  And I just kind of want to say this, generally, and then get your response.
[02:06:57.950 --> 02:07:05.433]  You know, for years, we've kind of had to approach these things very delicately, like walking on eggshells or something.
[02:07:06.073 --> 02:07:08.594]  And we used to say, you're just seeing the tip of the iceberg.
[02:07:08.614 --> 02:07:11.715]  Well, now you're starting to see the majority of the iceberg here, folks.
[02:07:12.275 --> 02:07:14.536]  And I'll just tell you, you're still not seeing the whole thing.
[02:07:14.596 --> 02:07:16.817]  There's things I could come on and talk about right now.
[02:07:17.677 --> 02:07:22.838]  Things that even happened in the last 24 hours that would just blow people's minds.
[02:07:23.218 --> 02:07:25.899]  It's hard for people to understand just how bad it is.
[02:07:26.299 --> 02:07:31.420]  When these leftists decide they want to destroy you, they're like rabid hyenas.
[02:07:31.961 --> 02:07:34.061]  They don't have any process of thought.
[02:07:34.541 --> 02:07:36.902]  All it is is seek, destroy, and eat.
[02:07:37.842 --> 02:07:38.923]  And that's all they do.
[02:07:39.003 --> 02:07:41.706]  There's no morals, there's no consciousness.
[02:07:42.146 --> 02:07:46.350]  It's just like a rabid hyena out there searching for raw meat in the desert.
[02:07:46.390 --> 02:07:51.354]  And once they've located their target, if it's Alex Jones, if it's Infowars, they never ever stop.
[02:07:51.374 --> 02:07:55.958]  But if they do, you know, get us down to a carcass, well then they're just going to go after the next person.
[02:07:55.998 --> 02:07:59.542]  So, Benny Johnson joins me now, the Benny Johnson Show, Benny Johnson on Twitter.
[02:08:00.222 --> 02:08:01.603]  I mean, when you hear this stuff,
[02:08:02.801 --> 02:08:11.219]  What goes through your mind as an American citizen to realize the danger that the average American is in with these weaponized institutions?
[02:08:11.239 --> 02:08:12.281]  There's no doubt about it now.
[02:08:13.450 --> 02:08:14.250]  Yeah, right.
[02:08:14.370 --> 02:08:19.252]  So, this is truly the greatest threat to democracy.
[02:08:19.452 --> 02:08:21.732]  That's sort of the trope that's being rolled out right now, right?
[02:08:22.092 --> 02:08:23.093]  It's a threat to democracy!
[02:08:23.213 --> 02:08:25.413]  Everything is a threat to democracy, right?
[02:08:25.453 --> 02:08:29.914]  If you don't follow the CIA on X, it's a threat to democracy, okay?
[02:08:30.875 --> 02:08:34.596]  If you don't order the soy latte, it's a threat to democracy.
[02:08:35.276 --> 02:08:36.656]  If you eat meat, it's a threat to democracy.
[02:08:37.136 --> 02:08:40.977]  But what is actually a legitimate threat to democracy?
[02:08:41.038 --> 02:08:42.578]  I mean, really, take a step back and ask that.
[02:08:43.038 --> 02:09:04.526]  Alex Jones is a journalist, fully protected by the First Amendment, and you have a CIA agent on camera bragging about how he, in the capacity of an FBI role that he had previously, was able to nudge and wink in order to destroy and, and I quote, chop his legs off so that he'd go bankrupt, saying that they got what they wanted.
[02:09:04.946 --> 02:09:06.526]  Tucker Carlson's on a list.
[02:09:07.187 --> 02:09:10.748]  If you don't have a First Amendment, then you have no other preceding amendments.
[02:09:11.408 --> 02:09:12.769]  So, is this a democracy?
[02:09:12.829 --> 02:09:14.131]  What is the threat to democracy?
[02:09:14.391 --> 02:09:20.856]  Moments ago, Olin, on my show, we had Representative Ana Paulina Luna talking about FISA.
[02:09:21.497 --> 02:09:25.541]  And she just told me, we actually have sent the clips to your producer, maybe we can get them up.
[02:09:26.962 --> 02:09:32.206]  She just told me that the intelligence community spies regularly on members of Congress.
[02:09:33.191 --> 02:09:43.459]  And that she knows for a fact that FISA is used, and the loopholes are used, in FISA to go after sitting members of Congress, specifically Republicans.
[02:09:43.959 --> 02:09:52.586]  If they use the term, shall not be infringed, which is something that she said on our program, then they will use FISA to actually spy on the first branch of government.
[02:09:53.066 --> 02:10:00.212]  So, citing our law, citing the Constitution, citing the Bill of Rights, is now worthy of being spied on?
[02:10:00.932 --> 02:10:01.073]  Yes.
[02:10:01.775 --> 02:10:01.975]  Yes.
[02:10:02.395 --> 02:10:04.977]  My producers are in touch with your producers.
[02:10:05.117 --> 02:10:06.458]  Maybe we'll be able to get the clip.
[02:10:06.478 --> 02:10:09.660]  We're just getting the clips up because our show just wrapped a few moments ago.
[02:10:10.101 --> 02:10:19.227]  And so, the sitting member of Congress, who's privy to these briefings, is saying, and she made such a great point,
[02:10:20.225 --> 02:10:25.589]  She says that the intel community comes in, sets up a SCIF, sets up a secure little, it's called the House of Horrors, right?
[02:10:25.609 --> 02:10:33.255]  I've had multiple members of Congress coming in talking to me about FISA, and they want so badly to be able to turn the tools of espionage on the American people.
[02:10:33.576 --> 02:10:41.002]  They wish to destroy our Fourth Amendment, obviously our First Amendment, our Second Amendment, and they want to be able to spy on all of us without a warrant, right?
[02:10:41.502 --> 02:10:43.263]  And this is kind of a unifying issue.
[02:10:44.163 --> 02:10:49.926]  There are people on the left and people on the right that all see very clearly on this issue and how wrong it is and how legal it is.
[02:10:50.407 --> 02:10:52.568]  And it seems like something that could totally unify us.
[02:10:52.608 --> 02:10:58.130]  Now, in order to move members of Congress, they set up these skiffs and they say there's going to be a terrorist attack.
[02:10:58.150 --> 02:11:07.115]  Or there's going to be something horrible that happens if you don't allow us to warrantless spy on every American we want to spy on, including Donald Trump and Republicans and members of Congress.
[02:11:07.475 --> 02:11:08.076]  We'll get a load of this.
[02:11:10.031 --> 02:11:16.216]  I asked the question, have they ever set up a skiff in order to brief you on the dangers of terrorists coming across the border?
[02:11:17.156 --> 02:11:18.077]  Like, here's a question.
[02:11:18.437 --> 02:11:27.805]  Has anybody from DHS, CIA, FBI ever set up a skiff on Congress, in Congress, to say, here are the number of terrorists that we've just let into the country?
[02:11:28.612 --> 02:11:29.693]  And the answer to that is no.
[02:11:30.373 --> 02:11:31.433]  They haven't done that.
[02:11:32.034 --> 02:11:34.995]  Because these aren't serious people.
[02:11:35.515 --> 02:11:37.336]  They're not serious about defending the nation.
[02:11:37.637 --> 02:11:54.285]  They're serious about being able to weaponize the awesome power of the intelligence agencies to spy on their political enemies, which they've proven with Donald Trump, they've proven with Alex Jones, they just admitted to doing with Tucker, and now a member of Congress, Anna Paulina Luna, from Florida, said they spy on her and members of Congress.
[02:11:55.558 --> 02:12:00.801]  Well, and let's just reflect on the Gavin Oblenus video there.
[02:12:01.481 --> 02:12:10.726]  Let's just reflect on some of the things he said, because I would probably even lean a little more conservative and say, this guy's just a blowhard.
[02:12:10.966 --> 02:12:14.388]  He probably has never been in the back of a surveillance van.
[02:12:14.588 --> 02:12:21.932]  The only access he gets to classified materials is when he's desk jockeying it, or transcribing it, or just engaging in hearsay.
[02:12:22.472 --> 02:12:23.854]  But the truth is, we need to know.
[02:12:23.974 --> 02:12:24.555]  We need to know.
[02:12:24.635 --> 02:12:26.718]  He needs to testify before Congress under oath.
[02:12:26.778 --> 02:12:27.479]  It's about time.
[02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:37.314]  All these people in the O'Keefe videos, and the Project Veritas videos, the sound investigations videos, they should all be testifying under oath, and yet nobody ever subpoenas them.
[02:12:37.474 --> 02:12:38.495]  But here's what's important.
[02:12:39.338 --> 02:12:45.082]  When he says things like the FBI can basically start a rally that they can turn into a riot.
[02:12:45.362 --> 02:12:47.024]  Well, is that what they did on January 6th?
[02:12:47.324 --> 02:12:50.506]  He says that they can put anyone in jail with a quote-unquote nudge.
[02:12:50.766 --> 02:12:52.528]  That's not new terminology.
[02:12:52.568 --> 02:12:54.970]  We've heard about nudges for a long time.
[02:12:55.010 --> 02:12:59.473]  They've been using nudges to get intel or to put people in compromising situations.
[02:12:59.713 --> 02:13:02.476]  He says that they're looking at Alex's followers.
[02:13:02.736 --> 02:13:10.023]  So what, if you go to Infowars.com or you watch the Benny Johnson Show, what, now the government spies on you is what he's insinuating there?
[02:13:10.463 --> 02:13:12.785]  Is the government encouraging lawsuits?
[02:13:13.866 --> 02:13:24.557]  I want to not go too deep into this right now, but let me just say, we have even more, should I say, suspicions or dare I even say evidence that
[02:13:25.472 --> 02:13:31.836]  I mean, there's patterns of behavior that would lead me to believe that there's a source for all of this stuff, right?
[02:13:31.876 --> 02:13:36.920]  I mean, this doesn't happen organically with some of the patterns that we're recognizing.
[02:13:36.980 --> 02:13:41.923]  I want to be careful talking about this for obvious reasons right now, but okay, does the government encourage lawsuits?
[02:13:41.943 --> 02:13:46.026]  Do they nudge people into lawsuits?
[02:13:46.606 --> 02:13:48.728]  So, these are the things that need to be asked.
[02:13:48.848 --> 02:13:51.089]  These are the questions that need to be answered under oath.
[02:13:51.129 --> 02:13:52.730]  These are the things we need to get to the bottom of.
[02:13:53.110 --> 02:13:55.112]  Now, when it comes to what Paulina breaks on your show,
[02:13:55.912 --> 02:14:00.655]  What's incredible about this too, Benny, is they have how many different ways to spy on us?
[02:14:00.936 --> 02:14:03.798]  Now they say they want to spy on us to stop the fentanyl epidemic.
[02:14:03.858 --> 02:14:05.479]  Well, we know where the fentanyl comes from.
[02:14:05.579 --> 02:14:06.880]  Everybody knows where the fentanyl comes from.
[02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:07.820]  It comes from the southern border.
[02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:10.522]  It's not coming from the average American making a phone call.
[02:14:12.283 --> 02:14:13.484]  Did Ana Paulina get in anything?
[02:14:13.524 --> 02:14:25.253]  Because they just reauthorized the FBI to spy domestically on individuals within three degrees of separation from an interesting person, let's just say.
[02:14:25.313 --> 02:14:41.486]  So like, if the FBI is spying on me for whatever reason, well now they can spy on anybody I contact, so they can spy on my family and friends, and then they can spy on anybody within one degree of separation from them, so their family and friends, and then one degree of separation from them.
[02:14:42.046 --> 02:14:44.569]  And basically it's the rule of six degrees of separation.
[02:14:44.589 --> 02:14:49.293]  I mean, I'm in touch with any human on the earth within the six degrees of separation rule.
[02:14:49.313 --> 02:14:57.581]  So with these things they basically say we can spy on anybody all the time and now we're learning it's even dirtier that they're targeting members of Congress.
[02:14:59.175 --> 02:15:10.588]  That's what a member of Congress just told me, and also that's what I can't believe she said on the record, but that's what multiple other members of Congress have told us before on and off the record.
[02:15:11.048 --> 02:15:19.398]  The background on this FISA stuff is extremely, extremely dark, and the real battle here is ultimately over warrants.
[02:15:20.198 --> 02:15:30.945]  I think that I, you know, would totally agree with the idea that if there is a terrorist who's in this country, let's remove how he got into the country, and that's an important question, so let's set that aside.
[02:15:31.625 --> 02:15:40.770]  If there's a terrorist in the country wanting to do something horrible, or some MS-13 gang member wanting to do something horrible, and you get a warrant to say this person's a member of whatever, ISIS,
[02:15:42.071 --> 02:15:44.355]  Then I'm in favor of that, actually.
[02:15:44.455 --> 02:15:45.677]  Like, get your warrant.
[02:15:45.777 --> 02:15:47.660]  Like, cops, go get your warrants.
[02:15:48.201 --> 02:15:50.785]  Nobody's arguing that issue here.
[02:15:51.366 --> 02:15:53.168]  And so that's the ultimate question here.
[02:15:53.309 --> 02:15:56.193]  They're fighting the fact that they have to get a warrant.
[02:15:57.051 --> 02:15:57.892]  That's the issue.
[02:15:58.312 --> 02:16:24.308]  The intelligence community has balked seven different times in this entire debate and has been using the people on the Intel Committee that are effectively owned and operated on both sides of the aisle, because you don't make it on that community without having, you know, without being obviously a servant of that intelligence apparatus, and have effectively drawn the line in the sand that we never, ever, ever want to get a warrant.
[02:16:25.049 --> 02:16:26.070]  That's the major question here.
[02:16:26.390 --> 02:16:35.896]  There have been people like Thomas Massie who have been so good on this, people like MTG, Matt Gaetz, and they have all said this is the line in the sand, and they'd probably get it to pass.
[02:16:36.377 --> 02:16:43.341]  They'd probably be able to get a vote that would pass requiring warrants for these searches, which means they would just need justification, right?
[02:16:43.381 --> 02:16:44.742]  This guy signed up for ISIS.
[02:16:44.842 --> 02:16:45.563]  Well, okay.
[02:16:46.003 --> 02:16:48.485]  Then, yeah, probably a bad dude, probably shouldn't be here.
[02:16:49.185 --> 02:16:50.186]  That's one question.
[02:16:50.566 --> 02:16:56.130]  And so they won't even budge on that, which just tells you, quite frankly, what they want to do with all this.
[02:16:56.270 --> 02:17:05.236]  They wish to spy on innocent Americans for their own objectives, who are peaceful, and who are following our laws, but they don't like our speech.
[02:17:05.516 --> 02:17:05.836]  Okay?
[02:17:05.936 --> 02:17:06.377]  Or whatever.
[02:17:07.105 --> 02:17:20.293]  Second question here is, again, why are they, if they're so concerned about terrorists in the country, which I am, you are, everyone is, if that's the question that they're concerned with, then how the hell did that ISIS member get into the country?
[02:17:20.313 --> 02:17:22.194]  Okay, let's assume there's a terrorist in the country.
[02:17:22.474 --> 02:17:23.055]  How'd they get in?
[02:17:23.675 --> 02:17:29.522]  Well, I would bet you dollars to donuts, as the old saying goes, that guy walked across the southern border.
[02:17:29.922 --> 02:17:34.147]  We know that thousands of people on the terrorist watch list walked across the southern border.
[02:17:34.588 --> 02:17:39.213]  So when the F was the last time that these intel community agents
[02:17:40.254 --> 02:17:45.337]  Did a briefing to say our southern border is allowing terrorists into our country.
[02:17:45.357 --> 02:17:50.760]  If you're so concerned about that, then you should probably go to the source of how terrorists are getting into our country.
[02:17:50.960 --> 02:17:52.141]  But they don't do that.
[02:17:52.801 --> 02:18:02.827]  Because if they did that, Owen, there'd be a narrative that Democrats are allowing terrorists into the country, against the will of the intel communities.
[02:18:03.327 --> 02:18:05.649]  It'd be an easy way to actually placate both sides.
[02:18:06.229 --> 02:18:10.171]  Because I want terrorists, I want them to be able to, like, stop terrorism, okay?
[02:18:10.952 --> 02:18:16.315]  And, uh, like, presumably, the way to do that, first and foremost, is to stop them from being in the country.
[02:18:17.216 --> 02:18:19.557]  So, that's ultimately the issue going down here.
[02:18:19.757 --> 02:18:24.180]  That's something that's being, like, apparently this is leading to streaming matches inside of the Republican caucus.
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:25.060]  Well, it should.
[02:18:25.661 --> 02:18:27.962]  But it's, I mean, this is a real breaking point.
[02:18:28.402 --> 02:18:29.463]  It's a breaking point.
[02:18:29.683 --> 02:18:31.804]  And this is why control of the media is so important.
[02:18:32.065 --> 02:18:35.707]  If we had a real media in this country, if we had a true
[02:18:37.008 --> 02:18:43.171]  Let's just say, just generally speaking, you look at the media landscape, it obviously is left.
[02:18:43.271 --> 02:18:46.913]  It doesn't just lean left, it's committed Democrat Party propaganda.
[02:18:46.933 --> 02:18:55.758]  If you look at the overall landscape of mainstream media, where people get most of their news, it's far left-leaning, far Democrat-leaning propaganda, essentially.
[02:18:56.238 --> 02:18:59.940]  And so because of that, you're never going to have a narrative like, hey look, the Democrats
[02:19:00.760 --> 02:19:02.281]  Let a terrorist into the country.
[02:19:02.561 --> 02:19:05.523]  But here's an actual applicable example of exactly what you're talking about.
[02:19:05.543 --> 02:19:13.227]  There was a man arrested, it was a young man, deranged, arrested in Idaho just a few days ago who was plotting a terror attack.
[02:19:13.267 --> 02:19:14.288]  He was plotting violence.
[02:19:14.348 --> 02:19:19.911]  Well, he was making public posts on the internet showing he was deranged and potentially violent and wanted to harm people.
[02:19:20.351 --> 02:19:24.173]  They went to the judge, they got a warrant, they spied on him, eventually they had enough evidence to go ahead and arrest him.
[02:19:24.453 --> 02:19:26.935]  So he's sitting in a jail right now, they might have prevented a terror attack.
[02:19:27.595 --> 02:19:35.762]  And so that's a real situation where you say, okay, you went through the right protocols, you did a good job, this is how the system is meant to be going down.
[02:19:36.082 --> 02:19:44.048]  But of course, that's like one case where they did something good compared to the thousands of cases where they're doing something bad.
[02:19:44.249 --> 02:19:45.590]  We have that clip from your show.
[02:19:45.630 --> 02:19:49.893]  Here's Ana Paulina Luna explaining this to Benny Johnson just moments ago on his transmission.
[02:19:52.615 --> 02:19:55.758]  So, do you think that members of Congress get spied on through these loopholes?
[02:19:56.338 --> 02:19:56.478]  Yes.
[02:19:57.375 --> 02:19:57.896]  A hundred percent.
[02:19:57.916 --> 02:20:02.901]  In fact, I'm quite confident in some capacity that I'm sure I'm on the list.
[02:20:02.941 --> 02:20:15.855]  I think that the administration has made it very evident that they believe that if you are Christian, if you are Republican, if you're conservative, if you say the words, shall not be infringed, if you believe in the constitution, that you're likely a domestic terrorist.
[02:20:16.650 --> 02:20:21.791]  We know for a fact that our friend and ally Tucker Carlson on this issue has been spied on.
[02:20:21.811 --> 02:20:22.811]  That's demonstrably true.
[02:20:22.831 --> 02:20:24.112]  They have the documents to prove it.
[02:20:24.132 --> 02:20:25.172]  The NSA has admitted it.
[02:20:26.172 --> 02:20:29.473]  And they were spying on Tucker Carlson to curtail his journalism.
[02:20:30.193 --> 02:20:31.133]  And why wouldn't they do that?
[02:20:31.193 --> 02:20:32.774]  Why wouldn't they turn that on members of Congress?
[02:20:32.794 --> 02:20:33.774]  How naive is Congress?
[02:20:34.634 --> 02:20:36.494]  Are they compromised?
[02:20:36.574 --> 02:20:37.775]  I just don't understand.
[02:20:37.935 --> 02:20:39.595]  Why would you allow this to happen?
[02:20:39.875 --> 02:20:41.696]  You're the first article of the Constitution.
[02:20:41.856 --> 02:20:43.096]  You're in charge of these people.
[02:20:43.598 --> 02:20:58.638]  You know, I think it's interesting because, again, you've seen that ever since we passed, or ever, not we, but ever since they passed the Patriot Act, ultimately what ended up happening is there's been this massive expansion of their surveillance state, and it even goes back into, you know, Kennedy's era.
[02:20:59.099 --> 02:21:00.620]  But the fact is, is that you are right.
[02:21:00.640 --> 02:21:25.890]  We're supposed to be serving as a check and balance and it's interesting because you have the intelligence community and the chairman, Turner, who I typically don't have issues with, but he goes on television and says that, you know, somehow the GOP has been infected by Russian propagandists, which is insane because now if you don't support Ukraine or you don't support a foreign intervention, of which we should have nothing to do with, somehow you are now an agent of that country, which is absolutely absurd.
[02:21:26.610 --> 02:21:30.473]  I think that, you know, we as a conference are having an identity crisis.
[02:21:30.493 --> 02:21:38.439]  You're seeing a lot of people that are retiring and leaving because they just don't want to deal with it, which is, I would say, actually a great opportunity for red-blooded Americans to get elected.
[02:21:38.479 --> 02:21:42.882]  And you're seeing President Trump is winning in a lot of these elections moving forward.
[02:21:42.902 --> 02:21:49.787]  So I'm hopeful for the next Congress that we hold it, but that we also hold it in the ideologies here that exist in Washington, D.C.
[02:21:50.447 --> 02:21:53.070]  So you get two big breaking news stories on your show this week.
[02:21:53.090 --> 02:21:54.051]  Congratulations, Benny.
[02:21:54.231 --> 02:21:56.574]  But let's focus on what she just said there.
[02:21:56.674 --> 02:21:58.877]  Because that to me, this is the future.
[02:21:58.937 --> 02:21:59.738]  This is the debate.
[02:21:59.798 --> 02:22:02.922]  This is where Republicans need to be looking 2024 and beyond.
[02:22:03.342 --> 02:22:05.164]  Let's say we do have massive victories here.
[02:22:06.265 --> 02:22:17.212]  The entire brand, the entire ideology, as she says it, of a Republican in Congress needs to represent the new change of the ideology in the Republican voter.
[02:22:17.612 --> 02:22:18.853]  We're sick of the corruption.
[02:22:18.973 --> 02:22:23.035]  We're sick of hearing a bunch of things and nothing getting done.
[02:22:23.555 --> 02:22:25.837]  And I think Ana Paulina Luna represents
[02:22:26.517 --> 02:22:35.780]  That side of things, you know, your Marjorie Taylor Greene's, your Matt Gaetz, Mitch McConnell trying to sabotage it right now by yanking the chain of Mike Johnson.
[02:22:36.241 --> 02:22:37.941]  But so just address that for me.
[02:22:37.961 --> 02:22:41.282]  You know, I kind of like to refer to it as the new right.
[02:22:41.442 --> 02:22:43.003]  You know, we expect results.
[02:22:43.143 --> 02:22:47.165]  We don't want to just hear our congressmen and women complaining about things.
[02:22:47.465 --> 02:22:49.966]  We want them to actually do something about it.
[02:22:50.046 --> 02:22:53.627]  This is just one of the new rights ideologies as I see it.
[02:22:54.898 --> 02:22:55.898]  Yeah.
[02:22:56.799 --> 02:22:58.639]  Why does everything just get rubber stamped?
[02:22:58.719 --> 02:22:59.440]  I don't understand it.
[02:22:59.720 --> 02:23:01.441]  For the life of me, I can't figure it out.
[02:23:02.001 --> 02:23:02.881]  What are we scared of?
[02:23:03.501 --> 02:23:07.163]  This is certainly not what Democrats would do, right?
[02:23:08.083 --> 02:23:11.544]  When Democrats face a loss, let's take 2016.
[02:23:13.345 --> 02:23:32.135]  When Democrats face a loss, they legitimately break every rule, every institution, rage and seethe and march and protest and rip every piece of bark off the tree, as you said, like a hyena.
[02:23:32.655 --> 02:23:35.136]  Not sure if that was a crack at Kamala Harris or not.
[02:23:35.156 --> 02:23:41.700]  You can see and hear the resemblance there, but either way, to get their result.
[02:23:42.847 --> 02:23:43.027]  I don't
[02:24:00.942 --> 02:24:02.443]  Approach to governance.
[02:24:03.044 --> 02:24:09.188]  And this is something that continually happens when you talk with members of Congress and when you talk with people that are particularly smart.
[02:24:09.209 --> 02:24:11.570]  Ted Cruz is the person who told me this over dinner.
[02:24:11.991 --> 02:24:21.058]  Ted Cruz goes... So I say, why were Republicans such simps during a time when we had unified control of government?
[02:24:21.898 --> 02:24:23.680]  President, House, Senate.
[02:24:23.860 --> 02:24:24.641]  We could do anything we wanted.
[02:24:24.661 --> 02:24:24.641]  2017, 2018.
[02:24:24.801 --> 02:24:26.042]  We could do anything we wanted.
[02:24:29.964 --> 02:24:32.947]  Uh, and we could nuke, you know, they had nuked the filibuster.
[02:24:33.227 --> 02:24:34.148]  You could have gotten it all done.
[02:24:34.508 --> 02:24:39.353]  And Ted Cruz tells me, um, we've lost the will to power.
[02:24:40.714 --> 02:24:43.537]  We've lost the, we've forgotten how to govern.
[02:24:44.690 --> 02:24:47.532]  Forgotten how to govern, I think, was almost exactly what he said.
[02:24:47.552 --> 02:24:53.076]  We forgot what it's like to actually wield power and to deliver for our base.
[02:24:54.116 --> 02:24:56.698]  And to do that, of course, you have to will these things.
[02:24:57.058 --> 02:24:59.740]  You would have to will the border wall, right, into action.
[02:25:00.501 --> 02:25:01.642]  It would have had to have been done.
[02:25:02.523 --> 02:25:04.926]  And we're just too easily howled.
[02:25:05.406 --> 02:25:10.512]  We're too easily, like, gimp-suited and ball gag put in the mouth and gimp-walked through the city.
[02:25:11.093 --> 02:25:14.897]  Like Mitch McConnell gets every single day by Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden.
[02:25:15.658 --> 02:25:25.046]  That is truly embarrassing, and I think that this is, I guess, the turning here, uh, is you finally have a party that is beginning to reflect the base of the Republican Party.
[02:25:25.526 --> 02:25:36.495]  You finally are getting members of Congress, like Luna, uh, and many others, actually, it's quite encouraging, who are younger, who really feel that energy of the grassroots, and who are willing to stand in the gap.
[02:25:37.036 --> 02:25:41.540]  Uh, in one capacity, it's very inspirational, um, in another capacity, it can't happen soon enough.
[02:25:42.020 --> 02:25:43.281]  Well, I like the way you said that.
[02:25:43.321 --> 02:25:50.749]  The analogy, we've lost the will, or it's like, the analogy that I used would be, I use a weightlifting analogy.
[02:25:50.769 --> 02:25:57.737]  It's like if I step up to the squat rack, and let's say, you know, there's 200 pounds or whatever on there, and I'm like, oh boy, I don't know if I can squat that.
[02:25:58.157 --> 02:25:58.798]  I'm too scared.
[02:25:58.818 --> 02:25:59.619]  I'm just not going to try.
[02:25:59.859 --> 02:26:04.684]  Or, you get up there, you try it, and you do it once, and you re-rack it, and you say, whoa, I can squat this.
[02:26:04.804 --> 02:26:04.984]  Thank you.
[02:26:25.592 --> 02:26:29.354]  There was nothing stopping anyone from building a border wall on day one.
[02:26:29.875 --> 02:26:33.857]  There was nothing stopping Republicans from mandating voter ID nationally.
[02:26:34.117 --> 02:26:34.437]  Nothing!
[02:26:34.858 --> 02:26:35.218]  Nothing!
[02:26:36.018 --> 02:26:37.599]  And single-day voting, nationally.
[02:26:38.040 --> 02:26:40.681]  Could have done it in 2017, first act of Congress.
[02:26:40.881 --> 02:26:41.342]  H.R.
[02:26:41.362 --> 02:26:41.342]  1.
[02:26:41.422 --> 02:26:41.882]  Could have been that.
[02:26:42.754 --> 02:26:42.934]  Right?
[02:26:43.134 --> 02:26:46.816]  Mandatory government voter ID, build the wall, and deportation.
[02:26:47.416 --> 02:26:48.456]  Like, consider that.
[02:26:49.076 --> 02:26:50.177]  A balanced budget amendment.
[02:26:50.657 --> 02:26:52.538]  Like, it all could have been done in that time.
[02:26:52.978 --> 02:26:54.599]  Of course, the defunding of Obamacare.
[02:26:55.079 --> 02:26:56.579]  Something that was a major campaign promise.
[02:26:57.099 --> 02:27:03.402]  But that is a perfect example, of course, as we all remember John McCain, that's a perfect example of how the Republican Party works.
[02:27:04.122 --> 02:27:07.403]  You get these hooks in you, if you spend too much time there.
[02:27:08.023 --> 02:27:20.708]  There's this great member of Congress named Tim Burchette, and it's such an honor to be able to go on programs like yours, obviously, and to be able to speak and to have programs like ours, where these members of Congress come on, and you're able to really talk with them.
[02:27:21.268 --> 02:27:27.050]  And Tim Burchette, he's this no-nonsense man from Tennessee, Knoxville area, and he says,
[02:27:27.870 --> 02:27:38.778]  Dude, the Intel agencies, they got their hooks into every chairman, every person with any power, Democrat and Republican, and if you don't... Cliff went pretty vile.
[02:27:39.118 --> 02:27:49.805]  He says if you don't play along, you'll wake up naked, which is the way that he says it, next to a strange woman with bottles of booze and drugs in a hotel room.
[02:27:50.842 --> 02:27:51.964]  And you'll wonder what happened.
[02:27:52.605 --> 02:27:55.590]  And your rear end hurts like after a ditty party.
[02:27:56.211 --> 02:27:58.495]  And Marjorie Taylor Green basically said the same thing.
[02:27:58.515 --> 02:27:59.978]  She says, is Mike Johnson blackmailed?
[02:27:59.998 --> 02:28:00.980]  What the hell is going on here?
[02:28:02.752 --> 02:28:05.794]  Dude, you know, this is what members of Congress are saying.
[02:28:06.534 --> 02:28:07.115]  People come for me.
[02:28:07.675 --> 02:28:09.536]  These are what the members of Congress are saying on our show.
[02:28:09.556 --> 02:28:12.318]  Imagine what they don't say when the cameras aren't on.
[02:28:12.378 --> 02:28:14.499]  They don't know what they're going to say publicly.
[02:28:14.679 --> 02:28:18.701]  Benny, things are going to get crazy with the next 200 and some odd days until the election.
[02:28:18.721 --> 02:28:20.442]  I look forward to seeing your coverage as well.
[02:28:20.462 --> 02:28:28.267]  Benny Johnson, no relation to Mike Johnson, but probably could make a mean doppelganger for Matthew McConaughey if he was forced to do that.
[02:28:28.607 --> 02:28:29.748]  Hey, thank you for joining us, Benny.
[02:28:29.788 --> 02:28:30.669]  Great job on your show.
[02:28:30.709 --> 02:28:32.610]  Congratulations on two big news stories this week.
[02:28:33.491 --> 02:28:34.672]  Way taller than Mike Johnson!
[02:28:34.712 --> 02:28:36.953]  Yeah, would not be able to beat a body double there.
[02:28:37.014 --> 02:28:37.234]  Yeah.
[02:28:38.795 --> 02:28:40.216]  All right, good stuff from Benny.
[02:28:40.716 --> 02:28:41.797]  Sometimes we can have fun, too.
[02:28:41.877 --> 02:28:42.157]  All right.
[02:28:43.278 --> 02:28:43.879]  Man, oh man.
[02:28:44.519 --> 02:28:46.581]  When we come back, we've got another great guest coming up.
[02:28:46.601 --> 02:28:51.064]  We're going to talk about the Julian Assange issue with the Aussie Cossack.
[02:28:51.244 --> 02:28:51.785]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:28:58.158 --> 02:29:04.219]  I know, as viewers and listeners, you've heard callers call in and talk about how X3 has changed their life.
[02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:08.460]  You've heard listeners talk about how incredible 10-hour clean energy TurboForce is.
[02:29:09.101 --> 02:29:11.461]  Well, both products are back in stock right now.
[02:29:11.761 --> 02:29:21.864]  In fact, X3 has been sold out for more than six months, but despite that, it is 40% off, because I want the people who have never tried the product to try it.
[02:29:22.024 --> 02:29:25.885]  Our regular listeners and the folks that have already tried it are chomping at the bit to get it.
[02:29:26.165 --> 02:29:26.965]  We appreciate them.
[02:29:27.705 --> 02:29:30.867]  But less than 1% of you ever buy a product at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:29:31.407 --> 02:29:31.887]  Go there.
[02:29:32.087 --> 02:29:33.368]  Try X3.
[02:29:33.748 --> 02:29:37.730]  Get the missing link that's essential to all electrochemical activity in your body.
[02:29:38.071 --> 02:29:41.372]  This is the purest, highest quality tri-iodine out there.
[02:29:41.913 --> 02:29:45.655]  You owe it to yourself to get a bottle and experience it for yourself.
[02:29:45.715 --> 02:29:46.975]  Takes a few inch to kick in.
[02:29:47.476 --> 02:29:49.117]  On average, get X3.
[02:29:49.657 --> 02:29:54.339]  While you're at it, get TurboForce 10-Hour Clean Energy at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:29:54.720 --> 02:29:56.581]  Both of them discounted right now.
[02:29:57.588 --> 02:29:58.529]  Hello Americans!

[02:30:08.896 --> 02:30:14.700]  Inflammation, the root cause of countless ailments, quietly wreaking havoc over time.
[02:30:15.761 --> 02:30:23.406]  Long-term exposure to inflammation has been linked to a myriad of health issues, from heart disease to arthritis, even cognitive decline.
[02:30:24.440 --> 02:30:32.074]  But fear not, for there's a beacon of hope found in the wisdom of nature, a remedy that has stood the test of time, turmeric.

[02:32:01.837 --> 02:32:05.000]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[02:32:05.400 --> 02:32:09.884]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[02:32:10.505 --> 02:32:12.647]  But we're not just exposing their operation.

[02:32:27.762 --> 02:32:31.286]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[02:32:31.546 --> 02:32:34.069]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.

[02:33:09.802 --> 02:33:12.287]  Thanks for watching!
[02:33:18.422 --> 02:33:19.103]  Big Brother.
[02:33:19.543 --> 02:33:20.784]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:21.364 --> 02:33:22.485]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:23.265 --> 02:33:24.666]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:24.947 --> 02:33:26.087]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:26.588 --> 02:33:31.111]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:31.711 --> 02:33:34.753]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:35.174 --> 02:33:38.696]  We're now joined by Simeon Boykov, also known as the Aussie Cossack.
[02:33:39.737 --> 02:33:46.081]  And I want to discuss the latest news in the Julian Assange story with him today.
[02:33:46.361 --> 02:33:46.882]  And, of course,
[02:33:47.862 --> 02:34:00.611]  Biden is, I suppose, whether you believe what he says or not, at least flirting with the idea of pardoning Assange or providing him with some form of relief, whatever he can.
[02:34:00.631 --> 02:34:07.757]  And I would just say, you know, the Biden administration is so desperate right now for any political points that maybe they are weighing that.
[02:34:08.809 --> 02:34:14.852]  I guess that'd be a kind of end-around way to finally have justice for Julian Assange, but Simeon joins me now.
[02:34:15.372 --> 02:34:18.133]  What is the latest in the Julian Assange saga?
[02:34:18.313 --> 02:34:19.614]  I've heard a bunch of news.
[02:34:19.874 --> 02:34:25.176]  We're talking about new incarcerations, we're talking about potential expeditions, potential pardons.
[02:34:25.536 --> 02:34:26.197]  What is the latest?
[02:34:28.138 --> 02:34:36.201]  Look, Assange has been on the top of the Australian agenda for the last months, increasingly, and years.
[02:34:36.781 --> 02:34:38.122]  And you wouldn't find any Australians
[02:34:38.612 --> 02:34:39.272]  We're good to go.
[02:35:09.039 --> 02:35:30.449]  Where he did make those demands, the Australian Parliament, various senators and parliamentarians have made requests to the US government to release Julian Assange and just recently we've seen in the last few days Biden answering questions of US reporters saying that he's considering the Australian request to release Assange.
[02:35:30.489 --> 02:35:32.450]  Now the thing is with Biden, we're not sure if
[02:35:33.263 --> 02:35:38.724]  This is just Biden fobbing off a response because we know that anything that Biden says can't be taken seriously.
[02:35:38.744 --> 02:35:40.225]  He doesn't know what time of day it is.
[02:35:40.505 --> 02:35:41.785]  He doesn't know whether he's coming or going.
[02:35:42.305 --> 02:35:47.587]  And I'm sure his response to that question by a journalist was not very thought through.
[02:35:47.607 --> 02:35:52.608]  There is activity on the diplomatic front of possible talk of prisoner exchanges.
[02:35:52.628 --> 02:35:54.969]  The question is which country would take Assange in?
[02:35:54.989 --> 02:35:57.529]  There's only one country which can take him in and that's Australia.
[02:35:57.549 --> 02:35:59.550]  The Australian government talks a lot about
[02:35:59.952 --> 02:36:06.194]  Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter who is currently incarcerated in Russia on suspicion of espionage.
[02:36:06.954 --> 02:36:16.037]  And they're fighting for his release, but unfortunately the Australian political elite are not fighting as hard for Julian Assange as they should be.
[02:36:16.497 --> 02:36:18.237]  He is only an Australian citizen.
[02:36:19.298 --> 02:36:26.560]  Australia is a key US ally in the AUKUS pact, which potentially could be widened
[02:36:27.031 --> 02:36:30.854]  To include Japan, Jocus, or Jocus as the Australian population calls it.
[02:36:31.834 --> 02:36:39.340]  Therefore, the Americans need, the American elite, the American globalists, need Australia on board, the Australian government on board.
[02:36:41.021 --> 02:36:43.002]  It's a time where Julian Assange needs to be released.
[02:36:43.603 --> 02:36:45.544]  The world would be a better place if he was free.
[02:36:46.425 --> 02:36:49.607]  And we, as Australians in Australia, we're looking forward.
[02:36:50.165 --> 02:37:04.748]  The Julian Assange's release, we hope it'll be that key moment in history where the global truth movement starts making very solid headway and gains in the global struggle against good and evil.
[02:37:05.348 --> 02:37:12.550]  I'm sure Assange could be very easily voted in as the Australian Prime Minister should he be released.
[02:37:12.970 --> 02:37:17.811]  He would be instantly very popular and that's why they're delaying their release of Assange.
[02:37:19.232 --> 02:37:21.913]  Unfortunately, Assange's health is on the line.
[02:37:21.933 --> 02:37:25.674]  I'm incarcerated myself.
[02:37:25.934 --> 02:37:27.534]  487 days within the Russian consulate.
[02:37:28.115 --> 02:37:31.856]  Nowhere near the thousands of days that Assange has spent incarcerated.
[02:37:32.256 --> 02:37:41.939]  But certainly there are some comparisons and after a certain amount of time of being incarcerated like that, the mental health factor really starts to get to him and that's what they're trying to do.
[02:37:43.058 --> 02:37:44.179]  Well, I'll tell you, that's
[02:38:05.765 --> 02:38:09.546]  Promising and heartwarming to hear the support that Assange has in Australia.
[02:38:09.666 --> 02:38:11.407]  You know, it's hard for us to get a read on that.
[02:38:11.487 --> 02:38:13.407]  I wouldn't have known much about that without you saying that.
[02:38:13.427 --> 02:38:14.408]  I'd like you to expand on that.
[02:38:14.908 --> 02:38:30.453]  What's interesting, though, is here in America, you know, when WikiLeaks was exposing what most of the public views as war crimes or lies from our Bush administration to get us into these wars and entanglements in the Middle East, Assange was a hero to the left.
[02:38:30.493 --> 02:38:34.094]  They kind of looked at him as a liberal leftist hero at that time.
[02:38:34.654 --> 02:38:45.744]  Then, when Assange just continued to do the work that he does, and was starting to expose things from inside the Obama administration and the Clinton State Department, all of a sudden now the left hated Julian Assange.
[02:38:45.804 --> 02:38:56.354]  Now I'm talking about in America, and so it's amazing to kind of watch that dynamic play out, but it sounds that the support for Julian Assange in Australia has remained consistent.
[02:38:56.434 --> 02:38:58.176]  I mean, for you to say that he could be...
[02:38:59.676 --> 02:39:03.497]  I mean, that must mean the support for Assange is huge.
[02:39:03.657 --> 02:39:04.837]  How is this reflected?
[02:39:06.498 --> 02:39:13.960]  There are very few things that everybody will agree on when we talk about the political spectrum in Australia of the left and the right.
[02:39:14.620 --> 02:39:18.701]  The freedom of Julian Assange is one issue which everybody seems to agree on now.
[02:39:19.901 --> 02:39:22.582]  The lefties, including the extreme left,
[02:39:23.716 --> 02:39:32.063]  They are some of Assange's biggest supporters in Australia and they're very active at the moment, marching in pro-Palestinian rallies and so forth.
[02:39:32.123 --> 02:39:39.609]  You've got the right who have always been traditionally also staunch in defending Assange as an Australian.
[02:39:39.649 --> 02:39:50.818]  But in my observations, in Australia at the moment, there are no significant political forces left which support the further incarceration and punishment of Julian Assange.
[02:39:51.678 --> 02:39:52.559]  Even the Prime Minister.
[02:39:53.250 --> 02:39:53.791]  I don't
[02:40:14.913 --> 02:40:22.437]  Important contentious issue for humanity, especially for Australia, but also the whole world, because this is where we need to make a stand.
[02:40:22.597 --> 02:40:25.139]  All Assad did wrong was tell the truth.
[02:40:25.159 --> 02:40:26.279]  It's as simple as that.
[02:40:26.980 --> 02:40:35.184]  And I mean, it would save the Biden administration, but one of the few things that Biden could promise or do to try to save his presidency.
[02:40:35.424 --> 02:40:39.787]  And now it'll be interesting how that plays out as a pre-election theme.
[02:40:40.827 --> 02:40:42.408]  Will the Biden administration
[02:40:43.183 --> 02:40:44.864]  Release Assange before the U.S.
[02:40:44.924 --> 02:40:45.284]  election?
[02:40:45.924 --> 02:40:48.725]  Or will it be a promise of the incoming future U.S.
[02:40:48.765 --> 02:40:49.985]  President, whoever that may be?
[02:40:50.085 --> 02:40:51.786]  And most likely, of course, that'll be Trump.
[02:40:53.927 --> 02:40:55.687]  Well, that's that's great foresight there.
[02:40:55.727 --> 02:41:03.070]  And in fact, if I was Trump, so if I'm thinking about this from raw political strategy, the Biden is desperate.
[02:41:03.110 --> 02:41:05.051]  The Biden administration is desperate for a win.
[02:41:05.811 --> 02:41:06.691]  They need it badly.
[02:41:07.051 --> 02:41:08.372]  And and they may view
[02:41:09.272 --> 02:41:14.054]  The release of Assange as a potential for a desperate win.
[02:41:14.534 --> 02:41:30.319]  Now, the measurements might be a little more microscopic than we realize, because again, the American left kind of turned against Julian Assange in 2016 and 2017 because of the exposure of the Obama administration, the DNC, and the Clinton State Department.
[02:41:30.639 --> 02:41:33.000]  And I also wouldn't be surprised if
[02:41:33.900 --> 02:41:47.966]  Joe Biden comes out and makes a statement, maybe off his script, in support of a potential pardon of Assange, and then he gets a buzz on the phone from Hillary Clinton saying, you better not pardon that son of a bitch, Joe, or we'll destroy your political career.
[02:41:48.906 --> 02:41:50.467]  Whatever's left of it, I suppose.
[02:41:50.847 --> 02:41:53.168]  So there's definitely going to be some tug of war going on.
[02:41:55.669 --> 02:42:02.131]  The strategy for the Biden administration, my guess would be to really just tease this, to try to gain as much momentum as possible.
[02:42:02.231 --> 02:42:09.134]  Maybe kind of just test the water of what an Assange release or an Assange pardon might do for him politically.
[02:42:09.494 --> 02:42:17.817]  But it's likely that they wouldn't make a move on that, depending on what they view would be positive for them, until closer to the election day.
[02:42:18.517 --> 02:42:24.780]  I mean, I would guess they wouldn't want to do anything too soon because it's too far out from the election if they're looking for a desperate win.
[02:42:25.700 --> 02:42:28.682]  On the other side, I think what you just thought of there is actually genius.
[02:42:29.683 --> 02:42:34.906]  Donald Trump could come out and say, I promise to pardon Julian Assange if I become the next president.
[02:42:35.306 --> 02:42:35.686]  Boom!
[02:42:35.767 --> 02:42:38.869]  He rips that potential victory out of the Biden administration.
[02:42:38.909 --> 02:42:43.832]  He takes the wind out of the sails of that potential political move from the Biden administration.
[02:42:44.955 --> 02:42:53.521]  And to me, it will win a lot of support with Trump from the libertarians that support Julian Assange, but maybe are kind of sick of Donald Trump for other reasons.
[02:42:53.981 --> 02:42:57.944]  So that would be a really... I mean, he already blew it once with Assange.
[02:42:58.264 --> 02:43:00.025]  He could come back and correct that mistake.
[02:43:00.085 --> 02:43:03.328]  And if he made that promise, that would be a huge political victory for him.
[02:43:03.948 --> 02:43:07.110]  And I think, quite frankly, it would embarrass the Biden administration.
[02:43:07.530 --> 02:43:09.872]  Well, what does Donald Trump want more?
[02:43:09.952 --> 02:43:11.173]  Does he want to prove a point?
[02:43:11.913 --> 02:43:13.254]  With Assange and keep him in prison?
[02:43:14.074 --> 02:43:15.415]  And remain not a president?
[02:43:15.575 --> 02:43:22.177]  Or does he want to become a US president again and use the Assange factor as wind in his sails?
[02:43:22.417 --> 02:43:34.682]  There's no doubt if whichever candidate for the US election takes the Assange theme and runs with it, there'll be a large section of the voter base who will vote and who will give their vote for Assange.
[02:43:35.042 --> 02:43:36.143]  It's up to the candidates.
[02:43:36.443 --> 02:43:37.063]  It's up to Biden.
[02:43:37.083 --> 02:43:37.683]  It's up to Trump.
[02:43:37.723 --> 02:43:39.644]  Whoever embraces that
[02:43:40.029 --> 02:43:40.809]  We're good to go.
[02:44:09.918 --> 02:44:11.759]  Is the Deep State in control?
[02:44:11.779 --> 02:44:12.339]  We know it is.
[02:44:12.479 --> 02:44:14.841]  And how much control does it have in Washington?
[02:44:15.441 --> 02:44:21.404]  Is a presidential candidate able to promise and fulfill the promise, go against the wishes of the U.S.
[02:44:21.444 --> 02:44:23.605]  Deep State, who do not want Assange freed?
[02:44:23.705 --> 02:44:34.771]  Because Assange probably still has many more secrets and Wikileaks files exposing all of their evil deeds and corruption, which makes them very afraid of Assange.
[02:44:34.791 --> 02:44:35.512]  They're afraid of the truth.
[02:44:35.552 --> 02:44:36.652]  They're afraid of being exposed.
[02:44:37.152 --> 02:44:38.193]  The Hillary's, the Obama's,
[02:44:39.737 --> 02:44:52.138]  All of their crimes and Assange is the one person on the planet who has fearlessly shown that he will expose them no matter the price and he's paying that price right now on behalf of all humanity.
[02:44:53.194 --> 02:45:02.897]  Yeah, and we're talking about governments lying to us about wars and other insider stuff, and so you get into the details of this, you'd think that all of humanity would be behind Assange.
[02:45:03.317 --> 02:45:05.858]  Now, you know, that's such a key point, too, that you bring up.
[02:45:06.618 --> 02:45:14.181]  The Democrats are trying to bring out people, single-issue voters, on the abortion thing, and really there has been no strategic response from the Republicans.
[02:45:14.981 --> 02:45:19.187]  Whether they want to face the abortion issue head-on or not, there still has not been a strategic response.
[02:45:19.227 --> 02:45:22.451]  You know, this could kind of be a strategic response when you think about single-issue voters.
[02:45:22.791 --> 02:45:23.152]  I agree.
[02:45:23.172 --> 02:45:26.797]  There are a lot of single-issue voters, specifically libertarians.
[02:45:26.977 --> 02:45:27.918]  They do have votes.
[02:45:27.938 --> 02:45:28.699]  There are millions of them.
[02:45:29.594 --> 02:45:32.156]  That would be a single-issue voter and it would be just on Assange.
[02:45:32.496 --> 02:45:34.118]  Otherwise, they might not vote for Donald Trump.
[02:45:34.138 --> 02:45:36.580]  But if he promises to pardon Assange, I think they would show up.
[02:45:36.600 --> 02:45:40.243]  I think there would be single-issue voters on Assange.
[02:45:40.323 --> 02:45:47.008]  And you know, I do wonder, because we both agree that Trump made a big mistake not pardoning Assange or helping Assange when he was president.
[02:45:47.589 --> 02:45:53.874]  I do wonder if he's learned from that, because he's obviously learned that he was deceived by the intelligence communities.
[02:45:54.494 --> 02:45:58.157]  He was probably underestimating the tentacles of the deep state.
[02:45:58.477 --> 02:45:59.658]  He had some good instincts.
[02:45:59.698 --> 02:46:03.220]  I think he knew that there were some shenanigans there, but I don't think he fully understood what it was.
[02:46:03.280 --> 02:46:04.782]  He's basically said as much.
[02:46:05.182 --> 02:46:08.764]  So maybe that understanding and that going through that process...
[02:46:09.853 --> 02:46:15.595]  Maybe that would lead him to reconsider the entire Assange situation as well, but I agree.
[02:46:15.615 --> 02:46:25.858]  I do think that would be a single-issue voter phenomenon, that the Republicans could get back some single-issue voters that the Democrats might get with this abortion issue, because there really is no strategy there.
[02:46:25.878 --> 02:46:29.599]  Now, as far as Assange's current status, what is his status?
[02:46:30.179 --> 02:46:32.940]  Is he going to be moved as far as where he's incarcerated?
[02:46:34.381 --> 02:46:36.741]  Is there anybody else trying to push for his freedom right now?
[02:46:37.261 --> 02:46:38.582]  What is his status right now?
[02:46:39.875 --> 02:46:47.058]  Well, the Australian government is the institute or the entity which should be fighting for his freedom.
[02:46:47.598 --> 02:46:52.059]  And the Australian government has shown a very weak effort over the years.
[02:46:53.100 --> 02:46:58.962]  We know that Joe Biden has not made any significant steps.
[02:47:00.022 --> 02:47:01.423]  Well, the question is, what could it mean?
[02:47:02.103 --> 02:47:03.784]  What he has said when he says considering?
[02:47:04.404 --> 02:47:04.544]  Well,
[02:47:05.703 --> 02:47:15.808]  He needs to understand, Biden needs to understand that the Australian Parliament actually officially passed a motion, a parliamentary motion in February, calling for the release of Mr Assange.
[02:47:16.748 --> 02:47:20.570]  And it's only up to the Australian Government to make these claims.
[02:47:20.610 --> 02:47:24.152]  I mean, the Russian Government can't defend Assange because Assange is not a Russian.
[02:47:24.252 --> 02:47:31.555]  Although if he was a Russian, like Edward Snowden, he became a Russian citizen, I think Assange would have been much better off.
[02:47:32.856 --> 02:47:34.657]  Unfortunately, the Australian Government is showing
[02:47:35.416 --> 02:47:41.219]  Real weakness in front of the USA and it's towing the line really to the deep state as well.
[02:47:41.239 --> 02:47:55.727]  So, the Australian Prime Minister has reacted already to Biden's words about considering Assange's release, saying in a statement on behalf of the Australian Government that Biden's words were, I quote, encouraging.
[02:47:56.508 --> 02:48:04.152]  Mr Albanese, the Australian Prime Minister, has said, we have raised on behalf of Mr Assange Australia's national interest that enough is enough
[02:48:04.634 --> 02:48:12.119]  This needs to be brought to a conclusion and according to the Australian Prime Minister he's raised that at every level of government possible.
[02:48:12.559 --> 02:48:23.365]  So the Australian Government's position is that there's nothing more to be gained by Mr Assange's continued incarceration and they are making somewhat of a feeble effort.
[02:48:23.725 --> 02:48:28.008]  But if Australia was really serious they would say no more weapons, no more funding,
[02:48:28.447 --> 02:48:38.089]  No more AUKUS payments, no $365 billion for the US AUKUS submarine deal, no sending of weapons to Ukraine, nothing until Assange is home.
[02:48:38.409 --> 02:48:42.710]  And that's what the Australian government has on the United States, it has that leverage.
[02:48:43.250 --> 02:48:56.313]  Because Australia being a non-NATO US partner, it has some bearing internationally, not much of course, and whatever international military help or support
[02:48:56.704 --> 02:49:03.509]  Well, A, that it sends the countries, for example, like Ukraine, on behalf of its so-called obligations to the U.S., a deep state.
[02:49:04.109 --> 02:49:05.190]  Well, it can stop doing that.
[02:49:05.350 --> 02:49:09.293]  It can simply just say, we're not supporting, we're not helping, we're not voting with you at the U.N.
[02:49:09.433 --> 02:49:10.554]  until you release Assange.
[02:49:11.074 --> 02:49:21.041]  Now, the Australian government has not done that, and all we can see so far is more lip service and more excuses from Australia's weak Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese.
[02:49:23.803 --> 02:49:25.244]  Now, Assange's health.
[02:49:25.564 --> 02:49:31.448]  We've heard some stories about poor health and, you know, maybe some mistreatment in there.
[02:49:31.648 --> 02:49:33.509]  What do we know about his health right now?
[02:49:35.150 --> 02:49:43.736]  We know that this week it marks five years of incarceration for Mr. Assange in London's Biltmarsh prison.
[02:49:43.776 --> 02:49:50.140]  Before that, he spent a whole seven years in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he was dragged out and arrested in 2019.
[02:49:51.878 --> 02:49:56.521]  Look, being locked inside a building for such a long time, Assange has lost the best years of his life.
[02:49:58.743 --> 02:49:59.844]  For mental health, it's not good.
[02:50:00.344 --> 02:50:05.808]  And there is a risk of Assange having serious health complications.
[02:50:06.208 --> 02:50:14.715]  There's a lack of vitamin D. He's kept in a constant state of stress and a lack of freedom.
[02:50:14.895 --> 02:50:18.117]  It's obvious that his health has been impacted.
[02:50:18.157 --> 02:50:20.739]  He's been robbed and his health has been robbed just for telling the truth.
[02:50:21.403 --> 02:50:25.544]  Now, being locked away for such a long period of time can be detrimental.
[02:50:25.584 --> 02:50:26.404]  It is detrimental.
[02:50:26.824 --> 02:50:42.166]  And his children, his wife, his father, his brother, his father John Shipton, who's a very honourable man and he's in contact with me sometimes, he says that the greatest problem is that Julian may not survive.
[02:50:43.067 --> 02:50:50.448]  And that will be a very serious black mark on the US regime, whichever regime.
[02:50:50.488 --> 02:50:51.188]  Who wants to have
[02:50:51.550 --> 02:50:52.230]  We're good to go.
[02:51:19.082 --> 02:51:23.684]  Pressured in a way where it becomes an election issue, a US federal election issue, the Assange factor.
[02:51:24.084 --> 02:51:29.267]  Whichever candidate embraces this factor, again, if it's Biden, he doesn't have to promise, he can do it now.
[02:51:29.767 --> 02:51:46.015]  If it's Trump, Trump can promise and he can do it the first day he enters office amongst other things that he's promised, including settling the Ukraine conflict and stopping Zelensky and stopping these Nazis in Ukraine from killing off the rest of the Ukrainian population.
[02:51:46.874 --> 02:51:58.761]  So it's going to be an interesting period coming up, and we'll keep an eye out on this story for Assange, but we really have to underscore and underline the humanitarian factor.
[02:51:59.502 --> 02:52:10.369]  As I mentioned previously, I've been myself holed up in an Assange-style scenario inside the Russian consulate building with diplomatic asylum that was granted to me from the Russian government.
[02:52:11.576 --> 02:52:13.397]  I was born in Australia as an Australian citizen.
[02:52:13.978 --> 02:52:25.366]  Luckily for me, I've got Russian heritage and the Russian government has given me a Russian passport by presidential decree and they have said that we will not surrender you or give you over to the Australian authorities.
[02:52:25.987 --> 02:52:28.709]  It's almost 500 days that I've been holed up.
[02:52:29.369 --> 02:52:34.533]  It sounds like a long time but compared to Assange who has been years and years and years
[02:52:35.599 --> 02:52:36.120]  Locked away.
[02:52:36.740 --> 02:52:37.601]  It's a drop in the ocean.
[02:52:38.201 --> 02:52:44.446]  But I certainly can, in some capacity, relate to what Julian must be going through now.
[02:52:45.807 --> 02:52:48.930]  The call is to free Assange and for our friends in the United States.
[02:52:49.030 --> 02:52:50.151]  Make this an election issue.
[02:52:50.311 --> 02:52:54.614]  Pressure the US presidential candidates and constantly question them.
[02:52:55.815 --> 02:52:57.136]  What is their stance on Assange?
[02:52:57.156 --> 02:52:58.317]  And we don't need even a stance.
[02:52:58.357 --> 02:52:59.017]  We don't need a view.
[02:52:59.037 --> 02:52:59.918]  We don't need commentary.
[02:53:00.158 --> 02:53:00.839]  We need action.
[02:53:01.319 --> 02:53:02.260]  Immediate release.
[02:53:03.315 --> 02:53:08.060]  There's no reason why Assange couldn't be released right now via presidential pardon from Biden.
[02:53:08.100 --> 02:53:10.782]  In fact, Biden probably saved himself.
[02:53:11.403 --> 02:53:13.404]  His ratings will definitely go up.
[02:53:13.765 --> 02:53:21.452]  He would have many people in his voter base who would respect him for releasing Assange and he'd get recognition internationally.
[02:53:22.813 --> 02:53:29.479]  The more Biden and the United States show their inaction on the Assange question,
[02:53:30.031 --> 02:53:34.593]  The more they simply empower other governments around the world who seem to care about Assange.
[02:53:34.633 --> 02:53:41.895]  For example, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maria Zakharova, is often commenting on Assange.
[02:53:42.355 --> 02:53:42.655]  Why?
[02:53:42.675 --> 02:53:45.356]  He's not even Russian, because it's the right thing to do.
[02:53:46.417 --> 02:53:48.777]  And this is where you either claim it or you lose it.
[02:53:48.957 --> 02:53:51.038]  And if Biden wants to claim it, he's got one chance.
[02:53:51.478 --> 02:53:55.660]  And he's got to start doing it right now, within the last few months that remain before the US election.
[02:53:56.380 --> 02:53:59.101]  Otherwise, his opponents would take full advantage of this.
[02:53:59.793 --> 02:54:08.798]  Personally, and I think Julian's family will agree with this, and Julian himself will agree with this, that it doesn't matter which US President makes the move.
[02:54:09.078 --> 02:54:09.939]  We know that it's coming.
[02:54:09.979 --> 02:54:10.679]  It's around the corner.
[02:54:10.719 --> 02:54:11.619]  We just need it done.
[02:54:11.960 --> 02:54:24.567]  Somebody needs to man up, take responsibility, and make the presidential order to simply pardon Assange and free him with free passage back to Australia to his family.
[02:54:24.607 --> 02:54:25.087]  Simple as that.
[02:54:26.189 --> 02:54:34.972]  You know, I don't think it's a coincidence that all of this starts happening to Julian Assange after he exposes the DNC and Hillary Clinton specifically.
[02:54:35.392 --> 02:54:41.174]  You know, when he was exposing the Bush administration, it was all good, but then he exposes the DNC and Hillary Clinton, all of a sudden...
[02:54:42.254 --> 02:54:47.336]  Well, history writes itself, and the rest is now history.
[02:54:47.416 --> 02:54:52.597]  And so, you know, your story is incredible as well, and I was about to say, hey, people can follow you on YouTube at The Aussie Cossack.
[02:54:52.657 --> 02:54:53.777]  Well, you've been banned there!
[02:54:54.277 --> 02:54:55.478]  Okay, so you've been banned there.
[02:54:55.498 --> 02:54:58.739]  So where can people follow your work and keep updated on this?
[02:55:00.359 --> 02:55:00.839]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:55:00.859 --> 02:55:10.182]  I was banned off YouTube for simply highlighting the unusual amount of excess deaths in Australia after the COVID period.
[02:55:11.051 --> 02:55:17.396]  Best place to find my work is on X at Aussie Cossack or on Telegram Aussie Cossack.
[02:55:18.197 --> 02:55:25.583]  It was a great community on YouTube, but platforms like YouTube, platforms like Facebook, this is already the past.
[02:55:25.703 --> 02:55:26.343]  This is history.
[02:55:26.884 --> 02:55:28.505]  They've dug themselves into a hole.
[02:55:28.926 --> 02:55:30.987]  Unfortunately, they still enjoy a strong market share.
[02:55:31.768 --> 02:55:38.133]  But the largest rapidly growing platform on the world, X and Telegram, let's hope the government doesn't shut
[02:55:39.706 --> 02:55:40.527]  That's all that remains.
[02:55:40.627 --> 02:55:52.712]  We'll be able to get the word out and each one of us should follow in Assange's footsteps in exposing the lies of the government and exposing their corruption and their evil methods.
[02:55:53.892 --> 02:56:00.815]  If we care about humanity, if we care about our children, we've got to think about what world will we leave to our children and our grandchildren.
[02:56:00.835 --> 02:56:07.698]  It's a very sad world that's getting worse and in that regard, the next few months should be very interesting to see how much
[02:56:09.187 --> 02:56:19.913]  We as a people, as an international community, and your predominantly US audience, as voters in the US presidential election, how much leverage have they got before the next US president?
[02:56:20.313 --> 02:56:23.595]  If people want things done, if they want Assad to be freed, it's got to be right now.
[02:56:23.615 --> 02:56:27.477]  It's got to be before the US election for a decision to be made imminently.
[02:56:28.957 --> 02:56:33.540]  Otherwise we just risk losing more years of Julian's life.
[02:56:34.870 --> 02:56:39.091]  He's not getting older, he's not getting younger, he's getting older, and it's getting very, very difficult, in fact.
[02:56:39.951 --> 02:56:54.994]  So, again, being myself, holed up in a Russian consulate for such a long time, awaiting a decision on, for example, a prisoner exchange deal, and I would love to exchange myself with, for example, Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter.
[02:56:55.494 --> 02:57:02.095]  He's a US citizen, he was arrested in Russia on espionage charges, I'm sure the Russians would release him, and
[02:57:02.810 --> 02:57:07.112]  The Wall Street Journal, if they care about their journalists, let's talk about exchanges.
[02:57:07.412 --> 02:57:10.793]  Is there plenty of people who could benefit from exchange deals?
[02:57:12.094 --> 02:57:16.615]  With Assange, he's such a high-value person, I don't think they would exchange him.
[02:57:16.675 --> 02:57:17.636]  It would take a lot more.
[02:57:18.596 --> 02:57:21.397]  So, fingers crossed, and we can only hope that Assange will be home soon.
[02:57:22.077 --> 02:57:24.278]  Well, your story is great, your coverage is great as well.
[02:57:24.378 --> 02:57:28.180]  We thank you for joining us today, Simeon Boykov, the Aussie Cossack.
[02:57:28.760 --> 02:57:31.281]  Keep up the great work, and we'll be praying for you as well.
[02:57:32.694 --> 02:57:33.214]  Thanks very much.
[02:57:33.234 --> 02:57:34.255]  Pleasure to join you.
[02:57:35.675 --> 02:57:38.576]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, when we get back, I'm going to give out the phone number.
[02:57:38.596 --> 02:57:43.778]  We're going to do about half an hour of phone calls on this hot topic of abortion.
[02:57:47.739 --> 02:57:59.042]  There is nothing more frustrating to me, whether it comes to news or anything else we're doing, than to know I'm telling the truth and to know they'll just listen to me and take action.
[02:57:59.503 --> 02:58:00.303]  It will change your life.
[02:58:01.178 --> 02:58:04.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have two great products that have been sold out for a long time.
[02:58:04.920 --> 02:58:07.661]  They're now back in stock at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:58:08.261 --> 02:58:11.743]  X3 is the highest quality iodine, the missing link.
[02:58:12.183 --> 02:58:14.104]  It is back in stock, 40% off.
[02:58:14.244 --> 02:58:19.807]  And so is TurboForce, 10-hour clean energy, naturally released.
[02:58:20.007 --> 02:58:20.768]  It is amazing.
[02:58:21.188 --> 02:58:23.409]  Both of these products fund the InfoWar.
[02:58:24.009 --> 02:58:26.590]  So they could be placebo and they'd still be great if they fund the InfoWar.
[02:58:26.891 --> 02:58:27.331]  They're not.
[02:58:27.971 --> 02:58:30.894]  If you'll just try TurboForce, you'll see the results in 30 minutes.
[02:58:31.214 --> 02:58:33.536]  Incredible energy for 10 hours without the letdown.
[02:58:33.896 --> 02:58:39.660]  But if you will just take X3 on average for about two weeks, you will see amazing results because it's the missing link.
[02:58:40.321 --> 02:58:46.466]  X3 and TurboForce, both discounted now for a limited time at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:58:47.492 --> 02:58:51.018]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[02:58:51.418 --> 02:58:58.449]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of, is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[02:58:58.630 --> 02:59:00.633]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[02:59:00.813 --> 02:59:01.875]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[02:59:01.935 --> 02:59:02.596]  He loved the idea.
[02:59:02.916 --> 02:59:06.438]  What would you call the debates and discussions about a pro-human future?
[02:59:06.458 --> 02:59:07.319]  Just Team Humanity?
[02:59:07.399 --> 02:59:08.300]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[02:59:08.440 --> 02:59:08.880]  Absolutely.
[02:59:09.200 --> 02:59:10.581]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[02:59:10.661 --> 02:59:14.103]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[02:59:14.344 --> 02:59:21.808]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to keep InfoWars on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[02:59:22.049 --> 02:59:27.132]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a
[02:59:27.312 --> 02:59:30.074]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[03:00:05.017 --> 03:00:17.540]  Alright, I'm here for the next 30 minutes of the fourth hour, and then Alex is going to be taking over with Steven Crowder and Steve Bannon.
[03:00:19.420 --> 03:00:28.582]  I've got some other odds and ends I might hit here, but I want to get out the phone line and talk about this abortion issue and what you think needs to be done.
[03:00:30.026 --> 03:00:32.307]  Do Republicans push back on the abortion issue?
[03:00:33.368 --> 03:00:37.170]  Do they make a hard-line stance for pro-life?
[03:00:37.270 --> 03:00:53.420]  Or do they maybe just sit back and wait till after the election and make a strategic decision and just kind of let the Democrats scream into the wind on the abortion issue looking like just insane, blood-lusting child killers?
[03:00:55.141 --> 03:00:56.181]  Or do they take a hard stance?
[03:00:56.201 --> 03:00:57.342]  Or do they try to divert
[03:00:59.016 --> 03:01:05.541]  And like we talked about in the last segment, if you're looking for single-issue voters, then you look at the strategy of pardoning Assange, if there's an interest there.
[03:01:07.222 --> 03:01:17.829]  Or do you just kind of ignore it, let the Democrats focus on that, and figure that that can't win over enough voters, and then you focus on the economy, you focus on the border, you focus on the other issues.
[03:01:18.810 --> 03:01:21.191]  So, there's a debate to be had here.
[03:01:22.512 --> 03:01:23.853]  And I want to open up the phone lines on this.
[03:01:25.334 --> 03:01:27.416]  Maybe we'll hit a couple of these other odds and ends as well.
[03:01:28.737 --> 03:01:34.080]  Remember though, in order for us to be on air, we need your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:01:35.281 --> 03:01:43.085]  And you hear the videos of that CIA contractor talking about how they want to take all our money and shut us down.
[03:01:43.765 --> 03:01:44.706]  Folks, it's very real.
[03:01:45.546 --> 03:01:48.788]  And it's really just absurd what goes on.
[03:01:51.169 --> 03:01:52.330]  And it becomes the
[03:01:53.986 --> 03:01:57.467]  It's just, it's the audience that saves us every time by shopping at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:01:57.487 --> 03:01:58.827]  There's no other way to put it.
[03:01:59.508 --> 03:02:00.588]  Otherwise we would be off air.
[03:02:01.528 --> 03:02:01.948]  Absolutely.
[03:02:01.988 --> 03:02:06.189]  Otherwise we would be broke, we would be shut down, they would take all our money, they would cut off our legs.
[03:02:07.010 --> 03:02:09.870]  That's their agenda and they've got unlimited resources to do it.
[03:02:12.171 --> 03:02:13.031]  And so it doesn't even matter.
[03:02:13.051 --> 03:02:14.792]  They can throw, they'll throw,
[03:02:16.005 --> 03:02:27.229]  100 grenades at us because they have the resources and 99 of them might be duds, but as long as one blows up in the in the trench, then they got us is how they look at it.
[03:02:27.269 --> 03:02:28.790]  So that's basically what they do.
[03:02:28.810 --> 03:02:32.331]  They just lob 100 grenades into our organization and hope one of them blows up.
[03:02:34.352 --> 03:02:42.255]  So you're starting to kind of see the full iceberg of it all, but there's still things that we don't even talk about on air that go on behind the scenes that are just absolutely nuts.
[03:02:43.876 --> 03:02:44.016]  But
[03:02:44.983 --> 03:02:48.184]  Yeah, we could easily just give up and say, OK, I mean, what's the point?
[03:02:48.204 --> 03:02:52.626]  I mean, anything we do here, they're just going to try to take us out and destroy us and steal our money.
[03:02:52.666 --> 03:02:57.387]  And so it's like, aside from just the work of going on air and covering news, we have to engage in these legal battles 24-7.
[03:02:58.268 --> 03:03:01.969]  But you continue to support us at InfoWarsTore.com, so we're not going anywhere.
[03:03:02.969 --> 03:03:08.911]  And we got great supplements, like Nascent Iodine, Survival Shield X3, 40% off, a true game changer.
[03:03:09.031 --> 03:03:10.432]  Read all the reviews for yourself.
[03:03:11.052 --> 03:03:12.793]  We've got Elite, Flagship.
[03:03:13.871 --> 03:03:22.158]  The supplement, DNA Force Plus, that is the flagship elite supplement, ladies and gentlemen, for telomere support with the CoQ10, the PQQ, that thing is just incredible.
[03:03:23.479 --> 03:03:25.021]  I take it every morning, every evening.
[03:03:25.921 --> 03:03:29.124]  So, great supplements, and then we've got things that you need, I would say.
[03:03:29.164 --> 03:03:31.206]  Household necessities, like water filters.
[03:03:31.466 --> 03:03:33.227]  If you're not filtering your water, what are you doing?
[03:03:34.025 --> 03:03:35.626]  How can you not have a water filter in your home?
[03:03:35.646 --> 03:03:44.432]  I mean, do I have to read the thousands of articles talking about all the chemicals in the water, the forever chemicals, the microplastics, everything else, the fluoride they put in it?
[03:03:45.073 --> 03:03:47.615]  It's just insane if you're not filtering your water.
[03:03:47.655 --> 03:03:51.617]  So we have the best water filters, Gravity Fed, InfoWareStore.com.
[03:03:52.338 --> 03:03:55.901]  We've got storable foods, insurance you can eat for emergencies.
[03:03:56.803 --> 03:04:00.126]  You would much rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it.
[03:04:00.146 --> 03:04:07.613]  If you buy storable food and it, you know, sits in storage for years and years and go by and you never eat it and expires in 25 years, then that's a victory.
[03:04:08.013 --> 03:04:14.839]  But, I mean, God forbid something bad happens, Biden collapses, everything starts World War III and you need that emergency food and you don't have it.
[03:04:15.700 --> 03:04:17.242]  So that's why we sell storable foods.
[03:04:18.530 --> 03:04:19.311]  Highest quality.
[03:04:19.431 --> 03:04:21.914]  Come in a container that's ready to be stored.
[03:04:22.414 --> 03:04:25.237]  It's all at InfowarsStore.com and it's your support there that keeps us on air.
[03:04:25.257 --> 03:04:27.340]  So, I open up the phone lines to the audience now.
[03:04:27.420 --> 03:04:28.181]  Another great resource.
[03:04:31.547 --> 03:04:33.508]  877-789-2539.
[03:04:33.528 --> 03:04:38.270]  877-789-2539.
[03:04:39.931 --> 03:04:44.073]  What should the Republicans do against this Democrat propaganda on abortion?
[03:04:44.113 --> 03:04:46.575]  Should they just ignore it and let them scream into the wind?
[03:04:47.215 --> 03:04:48.536]  Or should they face it head-on?
[03:04:48.576 --> 03:04:51.958]  Should they act as a pro-life hardened party?
[03:04:52.158 --> 03:04:55.500]  Or should they think strategically and think that that might hurt them in 2024?
[03:04:57.796 --> 03:05:00.039]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[03:05:00.219 --> 03:05:00.560]  Thank you.
[03:05:00.760 --> 03:05:03.323]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[03:05:03.403 --> 03:05:04.665]  I started taking that stuff.
[03:05:04.705 --> 03:05:07.889]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[03:05:08.009 --> 03:05:08.910]  When did you start taking it?
[03:05:09.191 --> 03:05:13.096]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[03:05:13.796 --> 03:05:29.669]  And I started eating a little better, but my blood pressure stayed high, and when I took the X2 iodine, after about three or four weeks, I think my body was detoxified of a bunch of metals and stuff that my body was storing, and my blood pressure came down to perfect level, and I tell people the only thing I did was X2 iodine.
[03:05:30.129 --> 03:05:43.995]  And even though I do think all your other products are good, I recommend to anybody that they start with X2 Iodine because it detoxifies your body and kind of kicks your natural DNA into full force.
[03:05:44.095 --> 03:05:47.536]  So, in my life, I found X2 Iodine to be best.
[03:05:48.016 --> 03:05:51.458]  I tried other Iodines and they didn't have the same effect.
[03:05:51.778 --> 03:05:54.079]  So, X2 Iodine, I really wanted to point that out.
[03:06:07.591 --> 03:06:09.031]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:06:09.271 --> 03:06:10.452]  Well, so does he.
[03:06:10.992 --> 03:06:12.432]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:12.932 --> 03:06:16.033]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:06:17.113 --> 03:06:21.414]  Alright, phone lines are lighting up on this issue.
[03:06:35.379 --> 03:06:46.561]  Remember folks, the Democrats really care about the LGBTQIAASP2 Plus community.
[03:06:48.181 --> 03:06:50.562]  So just remember that.
[03:06:51.062 --> 03:06:55.243]  They really care about those LGBTQIAASP2 Plus.
[03:06:55.463 --> 03:07:00.184]  So basically, it's just going to come down to anybody that's not a heterosexual.
[03:07:01.024 --> 03:07:01.944]  So maybe you like
[03:07:03.191 --> 03:07:04.792]  Having sex with couch furniture.
[03:07:04.972 --> 03:07:08.415]  Or maybe you like having sex with aquatic marine life.
[03:07:08.695 --> 03:07:10.196]  Well then they'll throw that in there.
[03:07:10.276 --> 03:07:12.678]  They'll throw the aquatic marine life attracted individuals.
[03:07:13.078 --> 03:07:17.401]  They'll throw the furniture attracted individuals.
[03:07:17.782 --> 03:07:19.343]  Or maybe that's the P, the pansexual.
[03:07:19.363 --> 03:07:20.564]  But that's not specific enough.
[03:07:21.724 --> 03:07:27.665]  Uh, maybe some people like, um, fornicating with food, and so you gotta make sure that's included in here, the food fornicators.
[03:07:27.685 --> 03:07:34.746]  You gotta add the FF in here eventually, so eventually it just, you can't even... Yeah, I guess you could just go all, you could just, maybe just boil it down to gay.
[03:07:36.046 --> 03:07:36.847]  Maybe, or just queer.
[03:07:36.867 --> 03:07:38.387]  You could just, maybe we just boil this down.
[03:07:39.567 --> 03:07:41.067]  Oh no, we gotta include everything.
[03:07:42.027 --> 03:07:45.688]  And of course it's all made up, it's all pseudo, it's all bullcrap.
[03:07:48.589 --> 03:07:50.229]  But they, they're there for ya.
[03:07:50.329 --> 03:07:50.769]  They love it.
[03:07:52.128 --> 03:07:52.869]  They love it.
[03:07:53.249 --> 03:08:01.336]  So, I want to take calls until Alex takes over here on this abortion issue and how you think Republicans need to handle it.
[03:08:01.376 --> 03:08:03.238]  But they got to make a decision soon, folks.
[03:08:04.419 --> 03:08:05.320]  And so, I get it.
[03:08:05.680 --> 03:08:06.341]  I'm pro-life.
[03:08:08.180 --> 03:08:13.802]  I understand political purism is cancer to any political movement, and you gotta think strategically.
[03:08:14.062 --> 03:08:17.443]  And so, maybe not everybody agrees with that, but they gotta make a decision soon.
[03:08:17.483 --> 03:08:24.245]  The Democrats have leaned into this, they've clearly made their decision, this is a single-issue voter phenomenon, and they have to make a decision.
[03:08:25.814 --> 03:08:35.066]  Do you just let the Democrats own this and just let them wail into the wind and prance around at these Capitol buildings about how much they love abortion and just don't even cover it at all?
[03:08:35.086 --> 03:08:35.987]  Just don't even say anything?
[03:08:36.007 --> 03:08:36.988]  Don't even make it an issue?
[03:08:37.349 --> 03:08:44.478]  So it just looks like liberals and Democrats just screaming into the wind, shouting about how much they love abortion, which might be a good strategy?
[03:08:46.690 --> 03:08:50.373]  Do you try to reshape the narrative and say, hey, they're lying about this.
[03:08:51.073 --> 03:08:53.735]  You can get an abortion in these circumstances.
[03:08:53.795 --> 03:08:54.195]  You can't.
[03:08:54.435 --> 03:08:56.557]  We're not saying everything is illegal.
[03:08:56.617 --> 03:08:57.638]  You're not going to get thrown in jail.
[03:08:57.658 --> 03:08:58.358]  All this other stuff.
[03:08:58.378 --> 03:08:59.699]  We're not trying to end the contraceptives.
[03:09:00.079 --> 03:09:02.021]  I think that's a bad strategy because you won't win with it.
[03:09:03.749 --> 03:09:08.233]  I mean, has trying to counter the Democrat lies on any of their propaganda ever worked?
[03:09:08.413 --> 03:09:08.634]  No.
[03:09:08.714 --> 03:09:12.998]  So it's not going to work with abortion either, and you're too late in the game to try that, so I'd throw that out the window.
[03:09:13.298 --> 03:09:14.019]  Maybe you disagree.
[03:09:14.759 --> 03:09:24.569]  Or you take a hardline stance on pro-life, and whether you figure it's a good strategy or not, you just do it for moral decisions.
[03:09:24.949 --> 03:09:27.732]  But do you really think morals matter to Democrat voters?
[03:09:29.690 --> 03:09:30.911]  You really think it's going to make a difference?
[03:09:30.951 --> 03:09:31.891]  So these are the questions.
[03:09:32.411 --> 03:09:34.212]  We go to the phone lines on this now.
[03:09:34.332 --> 03:09:36.553]  Chris in Kentucky, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:09:39.235 --> 03:09:59.365]  Yeah, Owen, I just wanted to say I know the whole argument about political purism, and I can appreciate that, but, you know, I feel like for a long time, we as Christians, we as people of faith, have basically compromised our way to hell.
[03:10:00.121 --> 03:10:06.025]  If you just look at our culture, you know, we're in Roe vs. Wade.
[03:10:07.226 --> 03:10:18.213]  My personal opinion is, if we're in Roe vs. Wade, why not just go all out and, you know, put God back in schools, put God back in public life?
[03:10:18.533 --> 03:10:20.054]  You know, take it all back.
[03:10:21.135 --> 03:10:29.120]  And, you know, if we don't believe that what we're doing is right, you know, what does that say about our faith?
[03:10:29.907 --> 03:10:34.728]  Let me ask you this, though, because this is the thought process.
[03:10:35.669 --> 03:10:47.172]  What if the only way you could accomplish any of that is winning back political power, but if taking a purist hardline stance on this issue cost you winning that political power back, would you still do it?
[03:10:47.212 --> 03:10:49.272]  Because, I mean, that's the conundrum here.
[03:10:51.753 --> 03:10:58.955]  It's a hard question to answer, but we're all going to have to answer one day to someone
[03:10:59.887 --> 03:11:03.650]  That's why we did what we did here on Earth.
[03:11:03.670 --> 03:11:10.114]  And if we don't take absolute stands, you know, I just think that says a lot about our own faith.
[03:11:10.935 --> 03:11:20.622]  You know, if we're not willing to step out on faith and do what's right in the end, how do we think we're going to be rewarded in these political battles?
[03:11:20.742 --> 03:11:25.305]  I mean, God has done miraculous things all throughout history.
[03:11:28.314 --> 03:11:34.575]  Do we really want to say, let's make a better political decision versus doing what's right?
[03:11:34.736 --> 03:11:36.656]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[03:11:36.956 --> 03:11:39.837]  And I, you know, I heard Charlie Kirk talking about this.
[03:11:39.957 --> 03:11:42.677]  Are you posing this question?
[03:11:42.717 --> 03:11:48.099]  But at the end of the day, I'd rather do what's right and answer to God for that.
[03:11:49.399 --> 03:11:50.859]  All right, Chris, thank you for the call.
[03:11:51.159 --> 03:11:52.520]  Let's go to Tim in California.
[03:11:52.560 --> 03:11:53.220]  Tim, you're on the air.
[03:11:53.260 --> 03:11:53.580]  Go ahead.
[03:11:55.094 --> 03:11:57.735]  Okay, I'm off subject, and I apologize for that.
[03:11:57.815 --> 03:11:58.655]  I'll just make it brief.
[03:11:59.156 --> 03:12:15.702]  About 45 minutes ago, FBI head Chris Wray is testifying in a public hearing, and this is, you know, they're fighting over the FISA, and right in the middle of this, some guy shows up between him and the cops that's got his hand raised up with a red paint on his hand.
[03:12:16.221 --> 03:12:18.582]  No matter whether you're for that or against that, it doesn't matter.
[03:12:18.602 --> 03:12:32.887]  The point I'm trying to make is, hey, you've got hundreds, if not, you know, thousands of people, maybe even grannies and stuff, that are in a prison for walking between velvet ropes, but this clown gets to show up behind the FBI director and hold up his red-painted hand, and what's going to happen to that guy?
[03:12:32.907 --> 03:12:34.968]  Because cops are behind him, it doesn't look like they're doing much!
[03:12:36.164 --> 03:12:45.508]  Well, look, and you're cutting real close to my heart here, Tim, because obviously I've been dealing with political persecution for five years because of that.
[03:12:45.688 --> 03:12:51.791]  And we happen to know, because we go to our research as part of the legal strategy, and we just realize it doesn't take in court.
[03:12:51.931 --> 03:12:54.252]  But yeah, I mean, we can present this in the courtroom.
[03:12:54.292 --> 03:12:55.533]  We can present this to judges.
[03:12:56.053 --> 03:13:05.217]  I can show thousands of examples of left-wing protesters getting access to the Capitol, disrupting congressional hearings, and they get nothing.
[03:13:05.777 --> 03:13:07.057]  They get nothing.
[03:13:07.297 --> 03:13:13.459]  But if you're Owen Schroer, I've now been on probation and politically persecuted for five years.
[03:13:14.079 --> 03:13:15.660]  For five years.
[03:13:15.860 --> 03:13:21.361]  And so yes, I've got the footage of the left-wing protesters marching through the Capitol with the blood on their hands.
[03:13:21.681 --> 03:13:23.302]  By the way, which I support!
[03:13:24.295 --> 03:13:28.479]  I do believe they have every right to do that, and I don't believe they should be charged or arrested.
[03:13:28.960 --> 03:13:32.883]  Detain them momentarily, escort them out of the building, ban them for 24 hours.
[03:13:32.903 --> 03:13:34.225]  I mean, you can have some measurements here.
[03:13:34.305 --> 03:13:43.113]  Obviously, we don't want total chaos, but I'm not cheering on, hey, they need to be arrested and charged and prosecuted and spend time in prison or be on probation for five years like me.
[03:13:43.934 --> 03:13:45.194]  So I'm consistent in my beliefs.
[03:13:45.254 --> 03:13:46.375]  Now, would the left be consistent?
[03:13:46.775 --> 03:13:47.015]  No!
[03:13:47.075 --> 03:13:51.556]  They celebrated when I got charged and incarcerated and sent to prison.
[03:13:51.796 --> 03:13:56.557]  And they ignore and celebrate their own protests in Congress and all these Capitol buildings.
[03:13:56.597 --> 03:14:01.118]  So, yeah, I mean, I could show the footage and they're going to continue to do it, but yes, you're right.
[03:14:01.738 --> 03:14:03.018]  Because here's what happens.
[03:14:04.958 --> 03:14:06.159]  And we've learned a lot about this.
[03:14:06.639 --> 03:14:09.459]  You kind of got me off topic, but that's an important call, so I'm glad you made it.
[03:14:10.800 --> 03:14:12.240]  The Democrats run the Capitol Police.
[03:14:13.590 --> 03:14:13.830]  Okay.
[03:14:14.791 --> 03:14:31.258]  When I went into the Capitol, totally legally and lawfully, in January of 2020, and I've got eyewitnesses to this, when I walked into the Capitol, because not all the Capitol police are bad, but it's the same story, I'm just doing my job.
[03:14:32.762 --> 03:14:43.407]  And I walk into the Capitol and the Capitol Police told me to my face, my camera person was right there, and they said, Owen, we've been told to arrest you.
[03:14:46.128 --> 03:14:46.669]  Verbatim.
[03:14:46.869 --> 03:14:48.950]  And I walk up and they all kind of look at each other.
[03:14:48.970 --> 03:14:51.931]  I don't know if they're sending a picture of me around or whatever.
[03:14:52.691 --> 03:14:57.674]  This was about 20 days after the impeachment hearing with Nadler and me.
[03:14:58.868 --> 03:15:03.534]  Where normally they would escort you out of the building and kick you out and say you can't come back for 24 hours, but not with me!
[03:15:04.535 --> 03:15:08.980]  Somebody got on the Capitol Police, probably Nancy Pelosi, said nope, you're gonna charge him, you're gonna arrest him, he's going to jail today.
[03:15:09.340 --> 03:15:11.083]  With any other protester, wouldn't happen.
[03:15:11.283 --> 03:15:14.166]  With any of these left-wing protesters, for Gaza, won't happen.
[03:15:14.587 --> 03:15:18.091]  But for Owen Troyer it did, because the Democrats run the Capitol Police and run law enforcement.
[03:15:19.076 --> 03:15:20.737]  So I go into the Capitol that day.
[03:15:21.378 --> 03:15:22.398]  There's the footage on the screen.
[03:15:22.778 --> 03:15:24.340]  I have a piece of tape over my mouth.
[03:15:24.800 --> 03:15:27.141]  And folks, if you don't know this, we have a lot of new audience members.
[03:15:27.622 --> 03:15:28.222]  This is January 2020.
[03:15:28.943 --> 03:15:32.185]  I'm standing in the Capitol with a piece of tape over my mouth.
[03:15:32.565 --> 03:15:33.446]  I went arrested.
[03:15:33.466 --> 03:15:36.127]  I got arrested and spent 36 hours in a D.C.
[03:15:36.167 --> 03:15:38.149]  gulag, the worst prison I've ever seen in my life.
[03:15:38.769 --> 03:15:43.530]  Literally hundreds of cockroaches, roach motel, no air movement, no food, nothing.
[03:15:43.951 --> 03:15:46.491]  And ended up being awfully sick.
[03:15:46.531 --> 03:15:47.011]  Never get sick.
[03:15:47.051 --> 03:15:47.692]  I was sick for a week.
[03:15:47.732 --> 03:15:48.632]  Couldn't get out of bed after that.
[03:15:48.952 --> 03:15:49.632]  Was I poisoned?
[03:15:49.652 --> 03:15:50.192]  Did I get COVID?
[03:15:50.212 --> 03:15:50.513]  I don't know.
[03:15:51.173 --> 03:15:51.553]  Doesn't matter.
[03:15:51.773 --> 03:15:56.054]  Point is, I get arrested and spend 36 hours in a jail.
[03:15:56.194 --> 03:15:57.895]  I'm in the Capitol with a piece of tape over my mouth.
[03:15:58.435 --> 03:15:59.435]  In the public area!
[03:16:00.175 --> 03:16:05.257]  Not even in the congressional areas, not even in the hearing rooms, in the public entryway.
[03:16:06.823 --> 03:16:15.266]  But they can go and do these protests, and they can go and do anti-Trump protests, and pro-Palestinian protests, and everything else, and they don't get arrested, they don't get charged.
[03:16:15.526 --> 03:16:15.786]  Why?
[03:16:16.026 --> 03:16:17.987]  Because the Democrats run the Capitol Police.
[03:16:18.207 --> 03:16:19.428]  They run everything in D.C.
[03:16:19.768 --> 03:16:27.371]  And I went into the Capitol that day, and all the police officers, because they knew what they're doing is wrong, they knew what they're doing is evil, but they got to do their job.
[03:16:27.731 --> 03:16:32.693]  And as soon as I walked in to go into the Capitol, they all started looking at one another, like, side-eyeing one another, like, uh-oh.
[03:16:33.695 --> 03:16:35.436]  Uh-oh, what are we gonna do here?
[03:16:35.476 --> 03:16:43.203]  We were told to arrest this guy and we know it's totally illegal and doesn't deserve to be arrested, but... And they said, Owen, we've been told to arrest you.
[03:16:43.283 --> 03:16:44.664]  Do you really want to go in here?
[03:16:44.684 --> 03:16:45.885]  And I'm like, what are you talking about?
[03:16:46.989 --> 03:16:48.510]  And so it's like a wink, wink, nod, nod.
[03:16:48.550 --> 03:16:50.412]  Like, dude, just walk away, man.
[03:16:50.432 --> 03:16:51.933]  We're going to take you to prison if you go in here.
[03:16:51.953 --> 03:16:52.854]  I'm like, what are you talking about?
[03:16:53.034 --> 03:16:58.058]  They said, Owen, we are told we have to arrest you if you go into the Capitol.
[03:16:58.078 --> 03:16:59.739]  Do you understand what we're saying?
[03:16:59.959 --> 03:17:02.321]  And I was like, well, I didn't do anything illegal, so I'm going in.
[03:17:02.821 --> 03:17:03.542]  And then what happened?
[03:17:03.862 --> 03:17:04.543]  They arrested me.
[03:17:05.143 --> 03:17:09.328]  So, Tim gets me off on a jag there, but you know, that's just the political persecution to deal with.
[03:17:09.548 --> 03:17:15.614]  The American left are psychotic, hate-filled ghouls that are going to destroy everything.
[03:17:15.854 --> 03:17:17.096]  Not just the country, folks.
[03:17:17.656 --> 03:17:20.519]  They're going to destroy everything.
[03:17:20.579 --> 03:17:26.526]  These are demonic entities that have truly
[03:17:28.638 --> 03:17:30.079]  Yeah, I got an out-of-the-box idea on the abortion issue.
[03:17:30.099 --> 03:17:34.762]  Nobody ever mentions, you know, it takes two to tango, and the fathers are always left out, and they never get a say.
[03:18:01.155 --> 03:18:02.276]  So what's the, okay.
[03:18:03.556 --> 03:18:12.918]  Well, they should, you know, the Republicans should make it an option, you know, that the father, if the woman doesn't want the baby, the father should have the option of taking the child.
[03:18:14.738 --> 03:18:15.598]  That's interesting.
[03:18:15.958 --> 03:18:18.459]  Or say the father can choose to have the abortion too.
[03:18:19.739 --> 03:18:19.939]  Yeah.
[03:18:20.199 --> 03:18:23.500]  Or yeah, there's got to be a bother agreement maybe, you know, just kind of a,
[03:18:25.524 --> 03:18:31.506]  Yeah, that would certainly throw a curveball.
[03:18:32.986 --> 03:18:40.068]  I don't really think it would work, because this whole thing is supposed to be pro-woman anyway, so they really don't want men to have a say.
[03:18:40.088 --> 03:18:42.569]  That's part of this bent, is just the hatred of men.
[03:18:44.189 --> 03:18:45.730]  So it probably wouldn't work strategically.
[03:18:47.614 --> 03:18:50.095]  Yeah, it is funny how nobody thinks about that.
[03:18:50.555 --> 03:18:54.435]  It is kind of an ironic thing that nobody thinks, well, what if the man wants to have the kid?
[03:18:54.475 --> 03:18:55.656]  Or what if the man doesn't want to have the kid?
[03:18:55.676 --> 03:18:56.276]  What say does he have?
[03:18:56.296 --> 03:18:56.936]  Well, he has none.
[03:18:57.176 --> 03:18:58.836]  But then if the kid's born, he has to pay all the bills.
[03:18:59.497 --> 03:19:02.117]  So, hey, women's rights, women's liberation.
[03:19:02.157 --> 03:19:03.017]  You guys are doing great.
[03:19:03.317 --> 03:19:04.198]  Thanks for the call, David.
[03:19:04.458 --> 03:19:05.838]  Let's go to Rex in Virginia.
[03:19:05.918 --> 03:19:06.578]  Rex, you're on the air.
[03:19:06.598 --> 03:19:06.998]  Go ahead.
[03:19:08.679 --> 03:19:09.399]  Hello, Alan.
[03:19:10.219 --> 03:19:15.520]  I thought your first caller was right on point when he brought up our faith.
[03:19:16.645 --> 03:19:19.967]  And you came back at him, what about political power?
[03:19:20.587 --> 03:19:22.848]  Well, political power is evil power.
[03:19:24.269 --> 03:19:30.031]  And I think that our faith is going to be the only thing that brings us through this stuff.
[03:19:31.072 --> 03:19:44.218]  Well, to be clear, I'm posing a hypothetical, saying that if we wanted, let's say that you knew, let's say if you knew that we could end abortion or make abortion legal, with whatever reasonable exceptions,
[03:19:45.365 --> 03:20:06.622]  Let's say that you knew that if the Republicans, let's say had a sweep, White House and Congress, that we could put an end to abortion in America, and you knew that, but we had to win in order to do that, would you drop the abortion issue ahead of the election in order to win, or would you take the hardline stance on it now and then lose?
[03:20:06.682 --> 03:20:08.564]  I mean, that's the hypothetical I'm posing.
[03:20:09.885 --> 03:20:12.007]  I think Donald Trump's position
[03:20:12.791 --> 03:20:14.093]  And it's brilliant.
[03:20:14.754 --> 03:20:15.815]  We have to get out of it.
[03:20:15.955 --> 03:20:19.640]  This is always a loser for the so-called Republicans.
[03:20:20.601 --> 03:20:29.712]  And I think let's stick with Donald Trump on this and let's stick together and get our faith together and get our country back.
[03:20:31.360 --> 03:20:36.744]  Well, and if you look at it, there is enough of a, you know, there's enough of a result now to decide, too.
[03:20:36.784 --> 03:20:47.931]  It's like, well, look, if you leave it up to the states, which is what Trump is saying, or you measure the results in the states, well, okay, states like Texas, Ohio, Missouri, red states, traditionally, are banning abortions.
[03:20:47.971 --> 03:20:49.753]  And then you have some other states that aren't.
[03:20:50.515 --> 03:20:56.698]  And so if you look at it like that, and you think single-issue voters are going to come out and vote on that issue, then you might say, well, we might lose these states.
[03:20:56.738 --> 03:21:01.980]  So I understand, you know, this is obviously a tough issue.
[03:21:02.040 --> 03:21:03.220]  And Rex, I thank you for the call.
[03:21:04.181 --> 03:21:05.481]  This is obviously a tough issue.
[03:21:07.842 --> 03:21:11.884]  The problem is, it's clear at this point that Republicans have no strategy to deal with it.
[03:21:12.805 --> 03:21:13.726]  Yeah, can you hear me?
[03:21:13.826 --> 03:21:15.327]  Oh, you're the greatest man.
[03:21:15.447 --> 03:21:16.508]  I listen to you and Alex every day.
[03:21:40.416 --> 03:21:47.460]  I'm like you, it's either leave it alone or go all the way and have protestors with bloody fetuses.
[03:21:47.961 --> 03:21:51.723]  But I think the Assange thing should be done tomorrow.
[03:21:52.403 --> 03:21:54.425]  That would win so many people over.
[03:21:55.866 --> 03:21:56.546]  Yeah, I agree.
[03:21:56.686 --> 03:21:57.687]  It would be so smart.
[03:21:57.747 --> 03:21:59.728]  I don't know what Donald Trump is thinking not doing it.
[03:21:59.768 --> 03:22:06.912]  No, I hope Alex is on the phone right now to him and saying, hey, I say if I get elected president, Assange is free the first day.
[03:22:07.453 --> 03:22:07.873]  Boom!
[03:22:08.754 --> 03:22:09.254]  Out of the box.
[03:22:10.475 --> 03:22:15.637]  Well it's, and he's obviously, I mean Trump does think of things strategically, right?
[03:22:15.677 --> 03:22:17.837]  I mean he has some good political acumen there.
[03:22:18.518 --> 03:22:38.144]  And so what, how he's misguided on this, the only thing, it's either that he was sideswiped by the intel communities on this deal, or he kind of looks at it from like a traditional American patriot perspective and like, you know, screw this guy, screw this Australian, showing America's dirty secrets.
[03:22:39.045 --> 03:22:40.686]  That could be the best move.
[03:22:40.786 --> 03:22:44.269]  I'm telling you, if he does that, he just won 10% more.
[03:22:44.409 --> 03:22:46.611]  Oh, I think it's huge.
[03:22:46.731 --> 03:22:48.432]  And I think the timing is great right now too.
[03:22:48.752 --> 03:22:51.714]  Trump doesn't really have to time something like that out.
[03:22:52.614 --> 03:22:53.654]  Like the Democrats do.
[03:22:53.754 --> 03:22:55.755]  Biden is desperate for political points.
[03:22:55.835 --> 03:23:05.037]  He's going to have to think... First of all, Hillary Clinton's going to get on the phone with Joe Biden and say, listen, you son of a bitch, you better not pardon Julian Assange after what he did to us.
[03:23:05.977 --> 03:23:09.778]  And so Biden will say, well, I need to kind of flirt this and throw this out there.
[03:23:09.838 --> 03:23:12.898]  Maybe for some red meat, it might help us politically, whether we do it or not.
[03:23:12.958 --> 03:23:14.339]  Kind of like with the student loan crap.
[03:23:14.679 --> 03:23:15.339]  Like Biden can't...
[03:23:15.939 --> 03:23:16.980]  Cancel student loans.
[03:23:17.400 --> 03:23:20.182]  He just tells people he can to hopefully earn some votes.
[03:23:20.202 --> 03:23:22.084]  So he can kind of do something similar with the Assange thing.
[03:23:22.324 --> 03:23:25.547]  So if I'm Trump, I just take all that away from him.
[03:23:26.147 --> 03:23:29.270]  I just come out and take it all away and say, yep, it's time to pardon Julian Assange.
[03:23:30.170 --> 03:23:30.771]  But I don't know.
[03:23:30.871 --> 03:23:32.032]  He failed on that once.
[03:23:32.832 --> 03:23:34.674]  I don't understand fully his thinking here.
[03:23:34.754 --> 03:23:35.895]  I just laid out what it might be.
[03:23:36.255 --> 03:23:37.236]  But yeah, I agree.
[03:23:37.456 --> 03:23:37.916]  I'd come out.
[03:23:37.956 --> 03:23:38.597]  I'd do it tomorrow.
[03:23:38.617 --> 03:23:39.237]  What are you waiting for?
[03:23:39.257 --> 03:23:40.618]  It doesn't cost you anything, that's for sure.
[03:23:40.979 --> 03:23:41.859]  Paul, thanks for the call.
[03:23:42.220 --> 03:23:43.721]  Let's go to Donnie in Oklahoma.
[03:23:43.761 --> 03:23:44.581]  Donnie, you're on the air.
[03:23:44.621 --> 03:23:44.962]  Go ahead.
[03:23:45.865 --> 03:23:50.866]  Hey, uh, Heidi, uh, hey, I got a couple of things for you, producer, for one.
[03:23:50.886 --> 03:23:59.688]  Uh, uh, Chris LeDoux is an underappreciated country artist with nice and calming music, like Toby Keith has got some fun stuff.
[03:24:00.068 --> 03:24:00.988]  I've got another thing.
[03:24:01.608 --> 03:24:04.109]  Uh, I come, I'm going to say Cherry List.
[03:24:04.589 --> 03:24:11.430]  You're on the Cherry List now, as I, uh, I was at 10 or 11 years old, called to the police station.
[03:24:12.292 --> 03:24:13.493]  They stopped by the house.
[03:24:13.633 --> 03:24:16.756]  My mom let me go down there with no lawyer or nothing.
[03:24:17.316 --> 03:24:22.080]  And I saw on the police chief's desk a whole list of kids.
[03:24:24.322 --> 03:24:26.404]  Everybody in town about my age.
[03:24:26.884 --> 03:24:38.153]  It's like if these customers of Infowars are worried, like yesterday that CIA or FBI guy going, uh, we're going after you.
[03:24:39.409 --> 03:24:40.750]  They've always been after us.
[03:24:41.210 --> 03:24:43.632]  I'm not worried about being on no damn list.
[03:24:44.212 --> 03:24:44.993]  I'm on the list.
[03:24:45.513 --> 03:24:45.854]  Okay.
[03:24:46.794 --> 03:24:48.335]  And we're coming after them.
[03:24:49.896 --> 03:24:52.398]  And I'll tell you, you're great job you guys are doing.
[03:24:53.139 --> 03:24:54.179]  Oh, one thing.
[03:24:54.820 --> 03:24:55.480]  You still there?
[03:24:55.861 --> 03:24:58.963]  Yeah.
[03:24:59.543 --> 03:25:00.164]  419's coming up.
[03:25:00.784 --> 03:25:07.869]  Do some sort of expose back to at least Waco or who's the guy in the
[03:25:09.036 --> 03:25:09.796]  Randy Weaver.
[03:25:12.797 --> 03:25:15.918]  That all needs, we don't need to forget about that.
[03:25:15.978 --> 03:25:17.159]  They're still doing that.
[03:25:17.479 --> 03:25:19.219]  And I'll tell you one more thing.
[03:25:19.319 --> 03:25:24.941]  I just spoke to somebody that's high up, that's trained in this stuff.
[03:25:25.621 --> 03:25:28.182]  And he said, this is the exact thing
[03:25:28.872 --> 03:25:32.875]  We were doing overseas what they're doing to us.
[03:25:33.815 --> 03:25:36.817]  And it's like... Yeah, I mean, who knows?
[03:25:36.878 --> 03:25:42.741]  The federal government under the Biden administration might just start raiding churches and raiding, you know, like a pro-life center or something.
[03:25:42.802 --> 03:25:43.842]  I mean, it's just out of control.
[03:25:44.283 --> 03:25:45.703]  Let's go to Jack in Wisconsin.
[03:25:45.743 --> 03:25:46.524]  Jack, you're on the air.
[03:25:46.544 --> 03:25:46.964]  Go ahead.
[03:25:49.166 --> 03:25:50.227]  Hey, how are you doing, Big O?
[03:25:51.820 --> 03:26:00.903]  You know, you're always way ahead of the curve with the abortion conflict and with this current part of the war for saving babies' lives.
[03:26:01.363 --> 03:26:20.969]  I think we should take a page out of the Democratic Party playbook and use science to kind of sway more people towards the pro-life point of view, like how you were suggesting many times, especially on your nighttime show, the heart beat bill.
[03:26:21.590 --> 03:26:32.935]  And now with all this brain scanning capabilities with Neuralink, I think even better than that, and it would be advantageous to us, is to see when a fetus or baby in the womb is experiencing pain.
[03:26:33.375 --> 03:26:36.836]  Because I believe that's earlier than the heartbeat.
[03:26:37.216 --> 03:26:38.457]  Same with thoughts and dreams.
[03:26:38.977 --> 03:26:39.497]  What do you think?
[03:26:39.517 --> 03:26:44.379]  Because, you know, Democrats are all about science and following the science and etc.
[03:26:44.659 --> 03:26:45.279]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:26:45.860 --> 03:26:48.961]  Or, there's so many different strategic ways to do this.
[03:26:49.753 --> 03:26:51.174]  But you're going in the right direction.
[03:26:51.294 --> 03:27:06.403]  It's like, you come out and make a statement, or Trump comes out and makes a statement, whatever, whoever you think is the best to play this role, comes out and just makes a singular statement that you know is gonna go viral, that you know all the media is gonna cover, and you can go on the offense or you can go on the defense.
[03:27:06.423 --> 03:27:15.408]  I mean, you might come out and you might say, okay, well, um, we're not gonna make abortion a big political issue.
[03:27:16.843 --> 03:27:19.724]  We understand that some Democrats like to kill their kids.
[03:27:20.404 --> 03:27:23.586]  I mean, that's, I mean, if you're going to come out, because that's what it is.
[03:27:23.666 --> 03:27:25.186]  I mean, you, you throw them red meat.
[03:27:25.206 --> 03:27:26.027]  I mean, that's what this is.
[03:27:26.507 --> 03:27:28.968]  If Democrats want to kill their kids, fine.
[03:27:28.988 --> 03:27:30.108]  It's like, I mean, troll them.
[03:27:30.128 --> 03:27:35.891]  Hey, if Democrats want to kill their kids, there's going to be less Democrat voters, so they got to import people from the third world to come in here and vote Democrat.
[03:27:35.931 --> 03:27:41.933]  I mean, that's why, I mean, give them something that's going to piss them off and gnash their teeth and scream and shout into the wind.
[03:27:43.530 --> 03:27:45.391]  Have them admit that they're baby killers.
[03:27:45.571 --> 03:27:48.872]  Have them admit that they want to kill babies in the womb and harvest their organs.
[03:27:49.212 --> 03:27:52.233]  Then there's the whole organ harvesting and monetary process.
[03:27:52.253 --> 03:27:52.893]  What are they doing?
[03:27:52.953 --> 03:27:58.875]  No one's even answering the key questions we have, which is, what the hell are they doing with all these baby parts and aborted fetuses?
[03:27:59.215 --> 03:27:59.615]  Yeah, right.
[03:27:59.655 --> 03:28:01.236]  You see, and that's how you change the narrative.
[03:28:01.356 --> 03:28:01.836]  Bingo.
[03:28:01.996 --> 03:28:02.596]  Exactly.
[03:28:02.796 --> 03:28:03.817]  Great call, Jack.
[03:28:03.877 --> 03:28:04.817]  I'm sorry to the callers.
[03:28:04.897 --> 03:28:07.198]  Alex Jones is about to take over with Steve Bannon and Steven Crowder.
[03:28:07.418 --> 03:28:08.978]  But that's exactly it right there.
[03:28:09.518 --> 03:28:10.899]  That's how you change the narrative.
[03:28:11.579 --> 03:28:13.462]  See, the Democrats are owning the narrative war right now.
[03:28:13.922 --> 03:28:17.947]  Oh, Republicans want to kill black women and Republicans are denying health care.
[03:28:18.148 --> 03:28:18.788]  All BS.
[03:28:19.249 --> 03:28:20.270]  Change the narrative.
[03:28:21.051 --> 03:28:22.453]  Make it about organ harvesting.
[03:28:22.693 --> 03:28:24.436]  Make it about you want to stop a heartbeat.
[03:28:24.576 --> 03:28:26.178]  Make it about you want to kill your kids.
[03:28:26.598 --> 03:28:28.201]  Force them to respond to that stuff.
[03:28:29.656 --> 03:28:32.917]  And so you don't even have to make a hardline stance that might cost you some votes.
[03:28:33.737 --> 03:28:40.420]  You can just come out and change the narrative by making an extreme statement like that that they have to respond to.
[03:28:40.780 --> 03:28:41.640]  I mean, that's what I would do.
[03:28:43.161 --> 03:28:52.864]  But see, that's the problem, is that Republicans like to maintain some normalcy, and I get it, but it's like, hey, you know, Democrats are chopping up little boys and girls and calling them trans, so you might want to catch up.
[03:28:52.884 --> 03:28:54.145]  Alright, Alex Jones coming up next.

[03:29:25.040 --> 03:29:25.921]  Different level energy.

[03:29:29.362 --> 03:29:32.184]  It is a bunch of stimulants that are natural and good, with a good letdown.
[03:29:32.924 --> 03:29:33.344]  Amazing.
[03:29:33.704 --> 03:29:34.565]  TurboForce.
[03:29:34.605 --> 03:29:35.665]  Next Level Foundational Energy.

[03:30:55.868 --> 03:31:01.010]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:31:01.030 --> 03:31:02.570]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:31:03.331 --> 03:31:06.332]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:31:07.245 --> 03:31:15.309]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, the people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:31:15.329 --> 03:31:23.974]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:31:24.992 --> 03:31:27.873]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:31:28.633 --> 03:31:33.614]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:31:34.415 --> 03:31:37.415]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[03:31:37.455 --> 03:31:45.738]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[03:31:46.378 --> 03:31:49.959]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:31:50.679 --> 03:31:55.303]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to m4store.com, our funding problems will be over.

[03:33:21.658 --> 03:33:28.983]  On March 6th, 2001, Alex Jones first predicted the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center.
[03:33:29.163 --> 03:33:39.470]  You've got an element of the FBI and these war game scenarios where they can remote control a 747 and they're going to crash it into the World Trade Center.
[03:33:40.250 --> 03:33:46.375]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[03:33:46.875 --> 03:33:51.378]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[03:33:51.858 --> 03:33:53.620]  Alex joins us on the road.
[03:33:54.221 --> 03:33:57.384]  Alex, in order, there's a huge FISA fight right now.
[03:33:57.484 --> 03:34:00.488]  Chip Roy's telling us, other guys telling us, we could defeat this in the rule.
[03:34:00.988 --> 03:34:07.215]  Just get, Birchette's saying, the CIA and State Department's up on Capitol Hill saying, you can't, we can't have these warrants.
[03:34:07.255 --> 03:34:08.556]  You gotta give it to us warrantless.
[03:34:08.617 --> 03:34:11.480]  Your thoughts about FISA, warrantless FISA, sir?
[03:34:12.742 --> 03:34:13.322]  Well, that's right.
[03:34:13.342 --> 03:34:19.026]  Now the CIA says, oh, we'll stop the fentanyl if you just give us the ability to use the NSA system.
[03:34:19.046 --> 03:34:19.746]  It's found everybody.
[03:34:20.066 --> 03:34:21.007]  They're already doing it.
[03:34:21.467 --> 03:34:22.668]  They've already weaponized it.
[03:34:23.468 --> 03:34:27.150]  The Justice Department, the CIA, and NSA are all in with big tech.
[03:34:27.731 --> 03:34:29.352]  That came out of the weaponization hearings.
[03:34:29.832 --> 03:34:31.313]  They're using it against the people.
[03:34:31.413 --> 03:34:34.415]  And we don't like open borders or devalued dollars.
[03:34:34.755 --> 03:34:37.716]  Then we're called Russian agents when we're the loyal Americans.
[03:34:37.756 --> 03:34:41.839]  And we have the Justice Department, as you said earlier in your analysis, that has
[03:34:42.634 --> 03:35:00.005]  Since Biden got in, an openly declared war on populist Christian conservatives and our single largest political block of the country is the biggest threat to the nation when it's the globalists that have sold out America to communist China and to all these globalist forces.
[03:35:00.446 --> 03:35:08.871]  And so they really want to get the reauthorization of Pfizer, Marjorie Taylor Greene, use the case of this current CIA operative and former FBI agent.
[03:35:09.711 --> 03:35:10.652]  I don't
[03:35:29.626 --> 03:35:30.326]  Hold it.
[03:35:30.366 --> 03:35:30.807]  Slow down.
[03:35:30.847 --> 03:35:31.247]  Slow down.
[03:35:31.287 --> 03:35:31.867]  Hang on.
[03:35:31.927 --> 03:35:32.927]  Slow down.
[03:35:32.947 --> 03:35:33.788]  This is so important.
[03:35:33.808 --> 03:35:34.508]  I want to go back.
[03:35:34.688 --> 03:35:39.970]  Just give us the details on that, because this shows you why FISA's got to be beaten, why the deep state's got to be taken down.
[03:35:40.370 --> 03:35:44.071]  Walk through what we now have found out about your particular situation.
[03:35:45.231 --> 03:35:50.733]  This Gavino Blavis character has been at DHS for a long time.
[03:35:51.053 --> 03:35:54.375]  He's a big liberal SJW, Social Justice Warrior.
[03:35:55.375 --> 03:35:57.856]  And he then went and worked for the FBI.
[03:35:59.293 --> 03:36:06.840]  And now he works as a contract manager that manages the contracts and operations for the CIA.
[03:36:07.660 --> 03:36:26.757]  He got caught by one of these Project Veritas style groups that previously last year helped bring down Pornhub in Texas and triggered that criminal investigation when they caught the footage of executives at Pornhub saying, yes, we target and are trying to recruit children.
[03:36:27.711 --> 03:36:33.336]  So this very respected group, Sound Investigations is what they're called.
[03:36:33.356 --> 03:36:52.312]  They were out doing a dragnet research with undercover operatives of federal agents and were asking about persecution of people like Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones.
[03:36:53.095 --> 03:37:11.790]  And this Levis character starts bragging about how he was made aware at the FBI and CIA of how they had basically run an information operation against me, mainly to demonize Trump, where they made up a bunch of stuff I never said or did, hyped it all up in the press.
[03:37:13.010 --> 03:37:26.178]  Then advise groups how to sue me and how to do it in certain jurisdictions to basically rig it to, quote, cut my legs off, take me off the air, and try to silence me because, quote, I was one of the loudest voices.
[03:37:26.698 --> 03:37:30.721]  And so now the report has gone extremely viral.
[03:37:32.962 --> 03:37:37.325]  Elon Musk and others have been responding and saying it needs to be investigated.
[03:37:38.510 --> 03:37:47.061]  The same Democrat Party law firm that has been quarterbacking this against me is now quarterbacking the lawsuits against Elon Musk.
[03:37:47.682 --> 03:37:51.627]  They also have quarterbacked the operations against Giuliani and Trump.
[03:37:51.667 --> 03:37:53.629]  So it's all run out of New York and D.C.
[03:37:54.725 --> 03:38:02.710]  The information operations from D.C., the CIA, the legal response from the Democrats out of New York, and it's all right there.
[03:38:02.870 --> 03:38:05.452]  But just hang on, hang on, hang on.
[03:38:05.492 --> 03:38:06.352]  I want to make sure.
[03:38:06.993 --> 03:38:09.294]  This is their classic playbook to Alinsky.
[03:38:09.594 --> 03:38:15.158]  You had a platform and you were the loudest voice with no back down saying exactly what they were doing.
[03:38:15.598 --> 03:38:18.740]  They specifically targeted you to hurt the Trump movement.
[03:38:18.940 --> 03:38:22.663]  You were Alinsky'd with operatives, but most importantly,
[03:38:23.203 --> 03:38:31.429]  With actual government assets, with CIA, FBI, DOJ, they specifically target you for your destruction, sir.
[03:38:32.609 --> 03:38:39.274]  Well, just like exactly, just like we saw the weaponization hearings that you and I already knew about, we experienced it in the last six, seven years, but
[03:38:40.231 --> 03:38:46.574]  In the hearings last year, they confirmed that FBI and CIA, they even had the emails with the CIA saying, this isn't really legal what we're doing.
[03:38:46.594 --> 03:38:59.461]  I mean, that email came out where they were reaching out to Facebook, which is meta, and Instagram, and Google, and then Twitter at the time, and with hundreds of thousands of requests we know of, saying, take this down, take that down.
[03:38:59.521 --> 03:39:00.661]  What the hell are you doing?
[03:39:01.062 --> 03:39:07.505]  Cussing at the executives and high-level moderators at the big tech social media platforms,
[03:39:08.277 --> 03:39:13.723]  Not just on Hunter Biden's laptop, but on thousands of different subjects, including even the Afghan withdrawal.
[03:39:13.943 --> 03:39:23.213]  Hey, don't let people criticize the Afghan disastrous snap withdrawal that Biden did of the 80-plus billion in weapons that they gave the Taliban and the rest of them.
[03:39:24.809 --> 03:39:30.911]  Okay, so this is just another level of how they're inside of they're actually running this.
[03:39:30.971 --> 03:39:31.852]  It's totally illegal.
[03:39:32.312 --> 03:39:39.974]  It's a hundred times considerably larger on the scale of what came out in Senator Frank Church's hearings in the 70s.
[03:39:40.014 --> 03:39:42.695]  So we need serious hearings with serious teeth.
[03:39:43.115 --> 03:39:48.917]  We need funding to be cut to all these special units they've got, the CIA and the FBI.
[03:39:49.097 --> 03:39:53.279]  It's supposedly illegal to have the CIA operating domestically, but we know that
[03:39:54.139 --> 03:40:03.545]  In the middle of Obama's terms, he got that law removed and repealed, that the CIA couldn't engage in domestic propaganda.
[03:40:03.905 --> 03:40:08.168]  But it's still illegal for them to be engaged domestically, engaging American citizens.
[03:40:09.368 --> 03:40:16.232]  As you know, Steve's gone through a lot of hoops to be able to get the authorization to do that, and have pure evidence that someone is really working with a foreign power.
[03:40:16.272 --> 03:40:21.876]  But instead they just say, all MAGA, all conservatives are Russian agents or Chinese agents, when it's the complete opposite.
[03:40:22.436 --> 03:40:22.656]  I think?
[03:40:43.732 --> 03:40:47.315]  Penetrated by a real agent of the CCP.
[03:40:47.475 --> 03:40:50.677]  So this is the government waging war against the people directly.
[03:40:51.077 --> 03:40:52.258]  Here they are bragging about it.
[03:40:52.839 --> 03:40:55.260]  And it's hiding in plain view.
[03:40:55.381 --> 03:41:02.326]  And MTG has tweeted today, or posted on X that she's going to bring this up in the hearings.
[03:41:02.346 --> 03:41:05.268]  She's going to make an issue out of this latest case.
[03:41:05.288 --> 03:41:10.832]  But this is a keyhole we're looking through into a wider world where they're just openly sitting around
[03:41:11.372 --> 03:41:15.135]  Talking about how they're targeting whoever they see as the most effective journalist.
[03:41:15.476 --> 03:41:20.080]  Trying to put Trump in prison for saying they stole the 2020 election, which we know they did.
[03:41:20.420 --> 03:41:23.263]  Trying to put you in prison for standing up to them.
[03:41:23.683 --> 03:41:26.545]  Putting Trump's top campaign people in prison.
[03:41:26.986 --> 03:41:28.007]  This is the gulag.
[03:41:28.447 --> 03:41:31.249]  And if they can get away with Trump, they'll get away with anybody.
[03:41:31.269 --> 03:41:34.572]  So that's why I stand with Trump so strong and he's the man of the arena.
[03:41:34.592 --> 03:41:35.073]  So are you.
[03:41:37.425 --> 03:41:42.408]  Alex, real quickly, because I know you're going to bounce, but we've had control of the House for two years.
[03:41:42.748 --> 03:41:49.532]  We've had a Weaponization Committee, Oversight Committee, Judiciary Committee, MTG's fighting, but here we are trying to approve FISA, we're all in FISA.
[03:41:49.933 --> 03:41:54.115]  They're trying to put forward, the Republicans, they're putting forward a funding bill for Ukraine.
[03:41:54.135 --> 03:41:58.958]  We spent $129 billion, which they lied about all of it, but particularly about $14 billion, another $60 billion.
[03:41:59.418 --> 03:42:01.700]  They've done nothing on weaponization, nothing.
[03:42:01.940 --> 03:42:05.142]  This is all coming out because of one of these Project Veritize type groups.
[03:42:05.942 --> 03:42:06.742]  Nothing in the House.
[03:42:06.782 --> 03:42:11.143]  What are your thoughts about when we control the apparatus, the Democrats roll hard.
[03:42:11.444 --> 03:42:14.344]  Nancy Pelosi, as much as we hate her, she rolls hard.
[03:42:14.424 --> 03:42:15.865]  Mark Elias, they roll hard.
[03:42:16.225 --> 03:42:17.445]  We're a bunch of p****.
[03:42:17.565 --> 03:42:21.766]  Why are we two years into this and essentially nothing's happened?
[03:42:21.806 --> 03:42:28.988]  In fact, we're now trying to push the deep states warrantless FISA and we're trying to push the deep states $60 billion.
[03:42:29.508 --> 03:42:31.409]  And what world is that rational, sir?
[03:42:32.398 --> 03:42:32.979]  Well, that's right.
[03:42:33.019 --> 03:42:38.270]  And Biden's putting measures in that when Trump gets in, he won't be able to fire all these bureaucrats.
[03:42:38.928 --> 03:42:41.950]  Bill Clinton, when he first got in, he was a bad guy, but he knew what to do.
[03:42:42.230 --> 03:42:43.731]  He fired 98 of the 100 U.S.
[03:42:43.951 --> 03:42:47.133]  attorneys and put all of his people in.
[03:42:47.213 --> 03:42:52.355]  Trump has to, day one, when he goes in there, has to fire all the heads of these groups.
[03:42:52.856 --> 03:42:53.856]  He has to go down the list.
[03:42:53.876 --> 03:43:05.983]  He has to bring somebody in like you or others that know how to do a simple research, like we had Fiona Hill in there, the co-publisher of TheGlobalist.com, and she's literally on the board of Soros's
[03:43:06.803 --> 03:43:08.324]  Open Society Organization.
[03:43:08.624 --> 03:43:09.365]  It's real simple.
[03:43:09.705 --> 03:43:10.185]  Go check.
[03:43:10.205 --> 03:43:11.266]  These people work for Soros.
[03:43:11.286 --> 03:43:12.707]  They work for the Democrats.
[03:43:12.787 --> 03:43:14.168]  Are they anti-free speech?
[03:43:14.288 --> 03:43:15.469]  Fire their ass.
[03:43:15.849 --> 03:43:16.569]  Purge them.
[03:43:16.589 --> 03:43:19.311]  We don't want to put them in prison like they're claiming.
[03:43:19.531 --> 03:43:20.852]  Some of them need to go to prison.
[03:43:20.872 --> 03:43:25.075]  But day one, fire the entire leadership of the Deep State.
[03:43:25.475 --> 03:43:27.036]  Fire three, four levels down.
[03:43:27.056 --> 03:43:29.177]  And this is a war.
[03:43:29.597 --> 03:43:31.619]  And just get it done.
[03:43:31.639 --> 03:43:33.580]  And the left also said,
[03:43:34.548 --> 03:43:35.088]  That's right.
[03:43:53.357 --> 03:43:56.360]  People aren't standing up to the Democrats because they do roll hard.
[03:43:56.740 --> 03:44:06.028]  And members of Congress who aren't criminals, who have no criminal record, who have never been involved in corruption, they still know that the CIA will come after them, the FBI will come after them.
[03:44:06.329 --> 03:44:10.492]  So when they attack you, they attack me, they attack Trump, they are sending a message
[03:44:13.875 --> 03:44:15.436]  To everybody else.
[03:44:15.996 --> 03:44:18.518]  Okay, these guys aren't cowards, but look what we're going to do to them.
[03:44:18.798 --> 03:44:20.098]  You better sit there and shut up.
[03:44:20.118 --> 03:44:28.023]  But people should understand, the swath of destruction, as you said earlier, the corruption, the systemic stagnation is the real danger to everyone.
[03:44:28.323 --> 03:44:30.924]  We have an out-of-control, hijacked government.
[03:44:31.164 --> 03:44:33.946]  We have to take back control of our government as men and women.
[03:44:34.206 --> 03:44:36.867]  We have to call it like we see it, balls and strikes.
[03:44:37.267 --> 03:44:39.709]  And this globalist system is super unpopular.
[03:44:39.949 --> 03:44:41.990]  There is a giant populist awakening, but I cannot
[03:44:43.210 --> 03:44:48.071]  Overstate enough, and again, for people who aren't public figures, I say this all the time on your show, it's so important.
[03:44:49.167 --> 03:44:57.651]  You don't know how popular freedom is, but if you are an Alex Jones, or Tucker Carlson, or Steve Bannon, I haven't asked you this, but I'm sure it happens to them, it happens to me, you get mobbed.
[03:44:57.731 --> 03:45:08.196]  I was at a grocery store, and I'm here on vacation in Hawaii yesterday, and literally, a packed grocery store, 90% of the people were listeners and were shaking my hand.
[03:45:08.236 --> 03:45:11.697]  I was mobbed at the cash register by 30 people like I was Elvis.
[03:45:11.717 --> 03:45:14.278]  Now I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, ooh, I'm famous, ooh, I'm cool.
[03:45:15.139 --> 03:45:17.020]  Freedom is incredibly popular.
[03:45:18.439 --> 03:45:24.024]  Alex, I know you say it in all humility, it's about people of every ethnicity, all of it, rising up.
[03:45:24.064 --> 03:45:25.124]  They've had a belly full of this.
[03:45:25.665 --> 03:45:28.047]  The CPI numbers today, they're getting crushed again.
[03:45:28.487 --> 03:45:31.189]  The deep state's lying to them, the administrative state's lying to them.
[03:45:31.530 --> 03:45:32.270]  People have had it.
[03:45:32.670 --> 03:45:34.272]  And that's why Trump's their champion.
[03:45:34.512 --> 03:45:36.894]  As imperfect, President Trump's first amendment, he's very imperfect.
[03:45:37.454 --> 03:45:42.678]  As imperfect as Trump is, he stands in the breach and will not break.
[03:45:43.479 --> 03:46:11.307]  on any of this and they're trying to break him next week the criminal trial starts understand people next monday game changer uh... first time in the history of this country they're they're putting a uh... president in the docket on uh... on a number of felonies against him to prison at the same time the stripping malls wealth people have had a belly full of it alex jones and they particularly one of the songs was no how to support you how to get your contact as they're on a g hard to shut you down sir well that's right as finishing earlier point i was
[03:46:12.364 --> 03:46:12.484]  Yes.
[03:46:34.915 --> 03:46:59.820]  We are under a globalist coup, it's an information war, and the hardcore audience of War Room is right at the tip of the spear, and they can find what we do at RealAlexJones on X, or InfoWars.com, or Band.Video, and I'm just very, very thankful for you, Steve, and your amazing analysis, and your incredible guests, and I just want to thank you for all you do, and everybody should be praying for you and supporting you, because you are right in the center of the attack.
[03:47:01.874 --> 03:47:06.197]  Well, look, I may be near the center, but you and Trump are the two targets.
[03:47:06.418 --> 03:47:09.100]  I mean, they are trying to destroy Trump and they're trying to destroy you.
[03:47:09.780 --> 03:47:16.246]  And I say that not just financially or your freedom in jail, they're trying to come after you guys.
[03:47:16.306 --> 03:47:17.607]  I mean, I hope your security's great.
[03:47:17.747 --> 03:47:23.712]  I know President Trump's up to security because these guys are playing for keeps and they understand we're never going to relent.
[03:47:24.392 --> 03:47:31.995]  Our task and purpose is to save this country as a constitutional republic, and that means the administrative state and the deep state have to come down.
[03:47:32.475 --> 03:47:39.578]  And they're not going to turn over control of the most powerful nation in the history of this earth just because Alex Jones, Steve Bannon, and Donald Trump say, hey, we'd like our turn.
[03:47:39.598 --> 03:47:40.638]  Can you toss us the keys?
[03:47:41.038 --> 03:47:42.779]  MAGA would like to drive this for a couple years.
[03:47:42.819 --> 03:47:43.579]  It's not going to happen.
[03:47:43.759 --> 03:47:45.140]  Every day is going to be a show.
[03:47:46.215 --> 03:47:47.676]  You cannot overstate what you're saying.
[03:47:47.696 --> 03:47:50.919]  This is a real coup, and it's not just some globalist group that wants to control America.
[03:48:08.231 --> 03:48:15.821]  Going after the loyal Americans to sit on Bandai Video and watch Alex Jones on X, you cannot overstate what you're saying.
[03:48:15.861 --> 03:48:21.028]  I mean, this is a real coup, and it's not just some globalist group that wants to control America.
[03:48:21.088 --> 03:48:21.469]  They are
[03:48:22.228 --> 03:48:31.478]  Going after the loyal Americans to finish their takeover and really do some hellish stuff with the entire Great Reset, New World Order, Build Back Better.
[03:48:31.778 --> 03:48:39.367]  So people think living under Biden's bed, this is just a prelude to true totalitarianism, ladies and gentlemen, and they are going to
[03:48:39.847 --> 03:48:42.169]  Well, we're betting on you and President Trump.
[03:48:42.189 --> 03:48:44.470]  Alex Jones, thank you so much for taking time away to do this.
[03:48:44.490 --> 03:48:44.850]  Very important.
[03:49:18.558 --> 03:49:19.118]  Let me ask you this, though.
[03:49:19.138 --> 03:49:21.399]  You do have a lawsuit planned yourself.
[03:49:22.439 --> 03:49:22.659]  Yes.
[03:49:22.759 --> 03:49:26.500]  Can you explain that to people so they understand what it is that you're... Yes.
[03:49:26.600 --> 03:49:30.642]  And Stephen, I apologize for going on and on, but I could... Let me just finish my last question, then I'll get into that.
[03:49:30.662 --> 03:49:31.082]  Go ahead, Seth.
[03:49:31.862 --> 03:49:38.844]  My point is, Justice Department, IRS, law firms, rig courts,
[03:49:39.963 --> 03:49:41.203]  We're not allowed to defend ourselves.
[03:49:41.263 --> 03:49:43.504]  This is the cocktail they've used against Trump.
[03:49:43.544 --> 03:49:46.305]  It's the cocktail that they're now using against everybody.
[03:49:46.405 --> 03:49:50.706]  And absolutely, the only reason I want to sue them is to get my name back.
[03:49:50.786 --> 03:49:54.347]  I don't even want money, but I want to be able to call Oblevis in.
[03:49:54.367 --> 03:49:56.768]  I want to be able to call their other lawyers in.
[03:49:56.788 --> 03:50:01.229]  I want to be able to call in the PR firms because the mistake they made was run their mouth.
[03:50:01.249 --> 03:50:03.010]  I mean, the lawyers in Connecticut and Texas
[03:50:03.746 --> 03:50:10.872]  And by the way, the Texas Crips, the same ones suing Elon Musk, by the way, they got up at the courthouse steps when they won their cases.
[03:50:10.952 --> 03:50:14.495]  The judge had already found me guilty and then told the jury to find me guilty for a bunch of money.
[03:50:15.656 --> 03:50:18.358]  They said, our mission is to silence him.
[03:50:18.399 --> 03:50:19.319]  We don't want money.
[03:50:19.880 --> 03:50:27.546]  And that's now happening in the bankruptcy court where the judge is like, wait, the law says you can get money, but the law doesn't say you get to silence people.
[03:50:28.720 --> 03:50:29.241]  That's great.
[03:50:44.477 --> 03:50:44.597]  Yeah.
[03:50:59.394 --> 03:50:59.754]  Absolutely.
[03:51:16.261 --> 03:51:17.022]  We're already friends then.
[03:51:17.062 --> 03:51:19.586]  I said, listen, don't let it get to you because you're successful.
[03:51:19.606 --> 03:51:20.988]  You're one of the top talk shows.
[03:51:21.008 --> 03:51:21.629]  You're popular.
[03:51:21.929 --> 03:51:22.631]  People love you.
[03:51:23.151 --> 03:51:26.035]  Do not, I know you're smart, but you haven't been through a lot of this shit.
[03:51:26.056 --> 03:51:27.017]  You've been through some stuff.
[03:51:27.458 --> 03:51:29.440]  I said, I know the cut of this jib.
[03:51:29.621 --> 03:51:30.802]  I know the signature.
[03:51:31.303 --> 03:51:34.424]  This is 100% the Justice Department and the CIA.
[03:51:34.824 --> 03:51:35.745]  They create the narrative.
[03:51:35.765 --> 03:51:36.645]  They look at things.
[03:51:36.685 --> 03:51:38.506]  They go, we'll take this and we'll take that.
[03:51:39.106 --> 03:51:41.847]  And we'll make Alex Jones the guy that bullies kids and pees on graves.
[03:51:41.927 --> 03:51:42.327]  Exactly.
[03:51:42.387 --> 03:51:48.049]  And then we'll make Steven Crowder this guy that, you know, literally breaks women's necks and human sacrifices them.
[03:51:48.609 --> 03:51:49.810]  And it's just all made up.
[03:51:49.930 --> 03:51:58.693]  And then they just hype it and hype it to take what you're known for being smart and being funny and, you know, having a talented crew and reaching tens of millions of people.
[03:51:59.173 --> 03:52:00.494]  And now you're someone that, you know,
[03:52:00.774 --> 03:52:01.234]  We're good to go.
[03:52:24.165 --> 03:52:24.705]  I'm with him.
[03:52:24.805 --> 03:52:27.946]  I'd love for you to be involved, but that's hopefully in the works, you never know.
[03:52:28.266 --> 03:52:36.569]  You're supposed to be on one with him, and we were talking to him with Zero Hedge a few months ago, but he had basically a migraine headache, and I believe he was the guy who works 20 hours a day.
[03:52:37.629 --> 03:52:50.233]  And so, yeah, that's going on, and hopefully, I'm just throwing this out there, hopefully Elon Musk will bankroll a lawsuit against the deep state, because he's already bankrolled some other ones for all the censorship and things.
[03:52:50.753 --> 03:52:56.318]  Because the same people coming after him, the very same law firms are the ones suing him.
[03:52:56.618 --> 03:52:56.758]  Right.
[03:52:56.798 --> 03:52:58.780]  Well, a couple of things I wanted to touch on here.
[03:52:59.080 --> 03:53:04.965]  First off, if you could just give me a short answer on this, because then I do want to get to Elon Musk and some of the conservatives who haven't really stood in the line of fire like they should.
[03:53:05.786 --> 03:53:07.167]  I know you're talking about these lawsuits.
[03:53:07.187 --> 03:53:08.969]  I know you can't give too much information.
[03:53:09.509 --> 03:53:15.975]  But since you were discussing this with law firms beforehand, this new footage that's been revealed, how did your lawyers respond?
[03:53:15.995 --> 03:53:17.556]  Did they say, this definitely helps?
[03:53:17.676 --> 03:53:18.457]  Is it significant to them?
[03:53:20.009 --> 03:53:33.352]  Absolutely, because the fact that he's working for the DHS, FBI, and manages the technicals of ops, so he's the guy that's kind of like managing the technical systems.
[03:53:33.432 --> 03:53:36.592]  Well, he's an FBI agent, he's a CIA officer, he's got credibility, right?
[03:53:36.612 --> 03:53:40.673]  They're all heroes and good guys, they don't lie, and so that's their narrative.
[03:53:40.693 --> 03:53:42.994]  Of course, it's not true, but he's telling the truth here.
[03:53:47.418 --> 03:53:47.898]  Yes, we are.
[03:54:01.909 --> 03:54:02.390]  We're good.
[03:54:20.425 --> 03:54:24.969]  I wanted to get to, I know that Elon Musk called this disturbing, he put that out on X and you asked him to do a space.
[03:54:25.370 --> 03:54:27.492]  Let me kind of tell you something, Alex, that really bothers me.
[03:54:28.032 --> 03:54:29.113]  And I know you've had to deal with this.
[03:54:29.573 --> 03:54:32.556]  I know that sound investigations, I know they were working on this.
[03:54:33.097 --> 03:54:37.541]  And I know that, you know, these kinds of things that, you know, they circulate before they're made public.
[03:54:38.021 --> 03:54:40.443]  And there are a lot of people and outlets who could have.
[03:54:41.283 --> 03:54:45.186]  run with this, who could have supported it, and opted not to.
[03:54:45.646 --> 03:54:51.011]  And I tell you this, this has happened to me, people have seen it publicly, but for every time they see it publicly, they don't see it privately.
[03:54:51.031 --> 03:55:01.839]  You know, for example, when I've been on Pierce Morgan's show, every time he tries to get me to go on and denounce Alex Jones, and I just said, no, I'm not going to, you're not going to get me to say that I agree with everything that he says, but you're not going to get me to denounce him or condemn him.
[03:55:02.539 --> 03:55:02.800]  Why?
[03:55:03.460 --> 03:55:04.261]  Because he's my friend.
[03:55:04.701 --> 03:55:05.362]  Because he's my friend.
[03:55:05.822 --> 03:55:06.423]  He's a good man.
[03:55:06.583 --> 03:55:10.226]  He's not... No one's perfect, and at least you are very transparent about it.
[03:55:10.587 --> 03:55:11.988]  But they always try and do that, and here's the thing.
[03:55:12.388 --> 03:55:14.190]  I've also had that in depositions.
[03:55:14.651 --> 03:55:17.914]  I've had that behind the scenes, where the line of question... where you could not be less relevant.
[03:55:17.934 --> 03:55:19.936]  They go, and are you friends with Alex Jones?
[03:55:20.196 --> 03:55:21.617]  And every time I've had... I've just answered, yes.
[03:55:22.398 --> 03:55:22.839]  Yes, I am.
[03:55:23.219 --> 03:55:32.430]  And to be willing to take the risks that you do, and that a lot of people on Mug Club and people in independent media like Mr. Figueredo, who's going to be on, that to me should be the rule, not the exception.
[03:55:32.470 --> 03:55:41.020]  So to see other conservatives out there go, well yeah, this is wrong and it's railroading, but you know, we just don't want to touch it because it's Alex Jones and he's his own thing.
[03:55:41.741 --> 03:55:43.282]  You've been experiencing that for a long time.
[03:55:43.322 --> 03:55:54.485]  I would imagine that's why places like Rumble and Elon Musk are significant, because you and I both know there are people who put on the team jersey publicly, and they don't take on the fights that are actually difficult and require a little bit of fortitude.
[03:55:55.966 --> 03:55:56.586]  Well, that's right.
[03:55:57.706 --> 03:56:02.428]  And this is a communist or totalitarian tactic where they'll pick one person to pick on at first,
[03:56:03.507 --> 03:56:04.527]  We're good to go.
[03:56:30.157 --> 03:56:32.559]  The media, the corporate press all piling on.
[03:56:32.579 --> 03:56:33.640]  I mean, I know what it is.
[03:56:34.000 --> 03:56:36.222]  That's their only power now because they have almost no viewers.
[03:56:37.403 --> 03:56:43.668]  But they can still scare politicians, scare media, that you're going to be targeted if you talk to this person.
[03:56:44.048 --> 03:56:54.076]  Well, the reason they don't people talking to Steven Crowder or Alex Jones or Tucker Carlson is because we're popular and we're telling the truth and the organic population likes us.
[03:56:55.069 --> 03:56:55.449]  That's right.
[03:57:14.209 --> 03:57:14.669]  I was here in Hawaii.
[03:57:14.709 --> 03:57:15.390]  It's already in the news.
[03:57:15.490 --> 03:57:15.790]  I'm here.
[03:57:16.271 --> 03:57:16.551]  Oh, okay.
[03:57:16.611 --> 03:57:18.673]  I was trying to keep it under wraps, but you just doxed yourself.
[03:57:18.713 --> 03:57:19.213]  Go ahead.
[03:57:19.834 --> 03:57:25.418]  But even TMZ said, oh, yeah, well, you know, we snapped a shot of him getting iced tea, by the way, at the bar.
[03:57:25.438 --> 03:57:26.539]  I was done being good.
[03:57:26.559 --> 03:57:29.802]  And people were coming over, shaking his hand, saying, good job.
[03:57:30.382 --> 03:57:30.943]  And I'm not bragging.
[03:57:30.983 --> 03:57:31.703]  It's not about me.
[03:57:31.783 --> 03:57:32.804]  It's that Freedom is popular.
[03:57:33.244 --> 03:57:35.586]  If I was, I was here in Hawaii.
[03:57:35.606 --> 03:57:36.627]  I was here every few years.
[03:57:36.707 --> 03:57:38.348]  I was here in Hawaii, like, five years ago.
[03:57:38.469 --> 03:57:41.071]  And I shook a lot of hands, but I got yelled at four or five times.
[03:57:41.091 --> 03:57:43.693]  I had a guy forward step on my fingers and my hand was out of the hot tub.
[03:57:46.701 --> 03:57:50.223]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[03:57:50.604 --> 03:57:57.628]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of, is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[03:57:57.808 --> 03:57:59.810]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[03:57:59.990 --> 03:58:01.030]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[03:58:01.050 --> 03:58:01.771]  He loved the idea.
[03:58:02.111 --> 03:58:05.633]  What would you call the debates and discussions about a pro-human future?
[03:58:05.653 --> 03:58:06.533]  Just Team Humanity?
[03:58:06.593 --> 03:58:07.474]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[03:58:07.634 --> 03:58:08.074]  Absolutely.
[03:58:08.394 --> 03:58:09.775]  And so, we have the t-shirt.
[03:58:09.855 --> 03:58:13.317]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family, standing against the globalists.
[03:58:13.517 --> 03:58:20.961]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to keep InfoWars on the air, so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[03:58:21.221 --> 03:58:32.967]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a revolution against the globalists, and it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[03:58:33.227 --> 03:58:34.548]  We're told humans are the problem.
[03:58:34.588 --> 03:58:35.568]  We're told we're killing the Earth.
[03:58:35.848 --> 03:58:40.111]  We're told all this garbage, so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[03:58:40.411 --> 03:58:41.131]  We're not going to do that.
[03:58:41.371 --> 03:58:46.014]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at mfullwestore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[03:58:47.215 --> 03:58:52.682]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[03:58:53.423 --> 03:58:57.710]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[03:58:58.110 --> 03:59:02.496]  We finally have a limited run, back in supply, at infowarestore.com.
[03:59:03.918 --> 03:59:06.701]  So many people have serious issues.
[03:59:06.961 --> 03:59:08.082]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[03:59:08.523 --> 03:59:13.948]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[03:59:14.468 --> 03:59:19.913]  Most other iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements, so you don't download it.
[03:59:20.514 --> 03:59:23.277]  But this is pure atomic certified
[03:59:25.163 --> 03:59:26.484]  I don't know.
[03:59:50.250 --> 03:59:54.176]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
