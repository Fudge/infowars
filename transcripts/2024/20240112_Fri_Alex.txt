[00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:17.040]  Corruption has run its course.
[00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:23.583]  It's 2024, and the minions of the Biden administration are inevitably being fed to the wolves.
[00:00:23.903 --> 00:00:37.429]  In hubris-riddled desperation, Hunter Biden yet again stormed the Hill to defend his privileged outpost as the bag man in a foreign pay-to-play family business scheme tied to the goals of the New World Order.
[00:00:37.629 --> 00:01:01.623]   The child man byproduct of a lifetime surrounded by federal goons and philandering politicians, It does not matter who you are, where you come from, or who your father is, or your last name.
[00:01:01.663 --> 00:01:04.285]  Yes, I'm looking at you, Hunter Biden, as I'm speaking to you.
[00:01:04.385 --> 00:01:06.066]  You are not above the law.
[00:01:06.446 --> 00:01:09.668]  I believe that Hunter Biden should be held completely in contempt.
[00:01:09.708 --> 00:01:11.570]  I think he should be hauled off to jail right now.
[00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.411]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[00:01:14.252 --> 00:01:15.393]  Excuse me, Hunter.
[00:01:15.233 --> 00:01:17.233]  Apparently you're afraid of my words.
[00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:19.233]  Whoa.
[00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:21.233]  [LAUGH]
[00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:24.233]  Are you ready?
[00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:29.233]   I'll answer your question, but you be quiet and let me make a statement.
[00:01:29.233 --> 00:01:32.233]  What kind of crack do you normally smoke, Mr. Biden?
[00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:39.533]   In an unprecedented outcome, the House will now vote on recommending criminal charges against the child of a
[00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:40.233]  sitting US President.
[00:01:40.688 --> 00:01:47.670]  President, as the GOP enters the final stages of an impeachment inquiry into the President himself.
[00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:59.155]   Meanwhile, Alejandro Mayorkas, dubbed the architect of the devastation, Finally garnered an impeachment proceeding that laid out the brutal facts against him.
[00:01:59.636 --> 00:02:11.906]  On Secretary Maricus' watch, Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 8.1 million encounters at America's borders, including more than 6.7 million at our southwest border alone.
[00:02:12.967 --> 00:02:19.653]  For comparison, CBP recorded just over 3 million encounters nationwide from fiscal year 2017 to 2020.
[00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:34.026]  Jay Johnson, President Obama's former DHS secretary, previously said that a thousand encounters a day, quote, overwhelms the system, end quote.
[00:02:35.242 --> 00:02:44.775]  On Secretary Mayorkas' watch, encounters have never averaged less than 3,000 per day, even going as high as 10,000 to 12,000 per day.
[00:02:45.155 --> 00:02:46.297]  It's not about money.
[00:02:46.818 --> 00:02:49.261]  We spent less money in 2019 than we did in 2023.
[00:02:49.301 --> 00:02:49.942]  A lot less.
[00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:56.429]  Through DHS, and we had the border under control.
[00:02:56.809 --> 00:03:01.133]  It's policy that has changed, and who is driving that policy?
[00:03:01.493 --> 00:03:02.834]  Secretary Mayorkas.
[00:03:03.134 --> 00:03:26.854]   It strains the resources, and it is wildly intimidating to our local law enforcement, where they have maybe a police force of three or four in a community of 2,000, and yet they have four or five illegal grows that are populated by illegal immigrants, Mexican cartel members, Chinese syndicated crime organization members, with Semi-automatic rifles abundant and they are unwilling to go in.
[00:03:27.034 --> 00:03:38.102]  Mayorkas should be investigated even further as to his knowledge and involvement of the massive foreign criminal operations infiltrating the American heartland under his watch.
[00:03:38.482 --> 00:03:48.926]  Throughout Oklahoma, law enforcement comes into contact daily with foreign nationals who have entered our country illegally or who remain here illegally or both.
[00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:56.529]  In Oklahoma, out-of-state residents can't legally operate agro through OMMA or be registered with the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics.
[00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:03.513]  Since the standing up of the Organized Crime Task Force, there have been 15 illegal grow operations shut down per day.
[00:04:03.733 --> 00:04:06.074]  And you track it all the way back to mainland China.
[00:04:06.214 --> 00:04:07.455]  That is the source of the problem.
[00:04:07.495 --> 00:04:14.238]  The Mockingbird Media and the Uniparty establishment would have us all believe that this is merely business as usual.
[00:04:14.538 --> 00:04:19.581]  Just two sides of the aisle muckraking as the election season ramps up.
[00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:33.777]  How have you been coping personally with the onslaught of accusations against your husband and your family, including and especially Hunter, showing pictures of him during vulnerable moments in his battle with addiction on the floor of the house?
[00:04:34.778 --> 00:04:36.619]  This would crush any family.
[00:04:36.739 --> 00:04:41.059]  Mika, I think what they are doing to Hunter is cruel.
[00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:48.418]   However, Hunter Biden and Alejandro Mayorkas are far more than pawns caught in the political storm.
[00:04:48.418 --> 00:04:53.499]   They are minions of a strategic globalist mafia threat to US sovereignty,
[00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:56.339]  commonly known as the New World Order.
[00:04:56.339 --> 00:05:00.499]   And they have each succeeded at harming the future and security
[00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:03.618]  of the Republic of the United States of America.
[00:05:03.618 --> 00:05:05.179]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:07.179]  Powerful is he!
[00:05:06.421 --> 00:05:07.022]  It's Friday.
[00:05:07.864 --> 00:05:08.445]  We're live.
[00:05:08.324 --> 00:05:17.003]  It's Friday, January 12th, 2024.
[00:05:17.003 --> 00:05:18.603]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:05:19.163 --> 00:05:23.886]  We got big military strikes in Yemen by the United States and England.
[00:05:23.926 --> 00:05:30.030]  We've got massive economic news, huge impeachment news taking place against Mayorkas in the Congress.
[00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.893]  It is a massive broadcast with special guests today.
[00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:34.953]  Again, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:05:35.414 --> 00:05:38.476]  But I gotta say it, I liked Governor Greg Abbott.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.303]  The first few years he was in, and I would give him like a B+.
[00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:46.186]  Then, under COVID, I would give him a F-.
[00:05:48.788 --> 00:05:50.990]  And he's gotten back up to about a B- lately.
[00:05:52.471 --> 00:05:53.452]  He went to an A+.
[00:05:55.894 --> 00:06:00.517]  Today, if this continues, it's leadership.
[00:06:01.078 --> 00:06:01.918]  It's constitutional.
[00:06:01.978 --> 00:06:02.319]  It's good.
[00:06:03.812 --> 00:06:20.156]  He has directed and signed an order for the state guard, the state militia, to begin at Eagle Pass, the main invasion point, where tens of thousands come across every few days, and then to spread out and to erect barricades on state land and block the feds.
[00:06:20.176 --> 00:06:22.577]  There's a showdown going on at Eagle Pass right now.
[00:06:22.637 --> 00:06:23.377]  It's on the local news.
[00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:27.358]  And they're spinning it like, oh, the state came in.
[00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.111]  To the city land on the border and took it.
[00:06:31.751 --> 00:06:36.793]  No, the state of a city doesn't follow its charter, can replace the police, everybody.
[00:06:37.874 --> 00:06:39.434]  They can dissolve a city.
[00:06:40.235 --> 00:06:42.095]  That's how it works at the state level.
[00:06:43.596 --> 00:06:47.797]  It goes state, county, city at the state level in the federal system.
[00:06:48.118 --> 00:06:57.041]  And it doesn't mean we're under a federal system, it's the federalist system, which is the separation of powers from the state and federal government and local government.
[00:06:58.328 --> 00:07:00.310]  So this is a big, big move.
[00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:01.971]  It's what I've been saying has to happen.
[00:07:03.133 --> 00:07:09.118]  And then if the governor has to levy a tax, I'm sure Texans would pay it, to deport these people.
[00:07:09.138 --> 00:07:17.346]  Because you're going to pay a lot more than flying them back to Haiti, or flying them back to Venezuela, a couple thousand dollars.
[00:07:18.367 --> 00:07:21.810]  You're going to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax money per person.
[00:07:22.271 --> 00:07:23.171]  And that's already going on.
[00:07:24.221 --> 00:07:29.785]  So he went from a B-plus down to a F-minus during COVID.
[00:07:30.886 --> 00:07:37.571]  Then he really started even outpacing the Santas, shipping illegals to New York, New Jersey, Illinois, you name it.
[00:07:37.951 --> 00:07:40.291]   And he went back to A B+.
[00:07:40.511 --> 00:07:41.532]  And I've said that.
[00:07:41.972 --> 00:07:47.235]  When I was on a few months ago, about a month ago or so with Tucker, he said, you know, your governor's horrible.
[00:07:47.255 --> 00:07:47.715]  He's terrible.
[00:07:47.755 --> 00:07:49.356]  And I said, no, I mean, I agree.
[00:07:49.556 --> 00:07:50.896]  He's very mediocre.
[00:07:50.916 --> 00:08:04.243]  But I said, it's hard when you got millions of people coming across and the feds are claiming that jurisdiction, which they have until they're derelict and until they have treasonous orders from Mayorkas and his boss, Barack Obama slash Biden.
[00:08:05.844 --> 00:08:08.505]  And so now the governor's done this, folks, you better back him.
[00:08:10.265 --> 00:08:11.466]  We better get a lot of press down there.
[00:08:11.486 --> 00:08:12.426]  We're going to go very soon.
[00:08:12.446 --> 00:08:14.487]  In fact, now probably is the time.
[00:08:16.328 --> 00:08:18.269]  There's just so much unfolding right now.
[00:08:18.409 --> 00:08:19.410]  So this is a big deal.
[00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.491]  And it's a constitutional crisis.
[00:08:21.551 --> 00:08:30.856]  But what the governor is doing is right, constitutionally, when the government is ignoring the Tenth Amendment, ignoring states' rights, and also the Ninth Amendment.
[00:08:31.897 --> 00:08:38.260]  Obviously saying that any rights not expressly there for the federal government are reserved for the states and the people.
[00:08:40.444 --> 00:08:41.144]  We know the numbers.
[00:08:41.184 --> 00:08:43.865]  The vast majority of even Democrats are against open borders now.
[00:08:44.645 --> 00:08:46.706]  Like 80% of New York Democrats are against it.
[00:08:47.306 --> 00:08:48.786]  It's like 90 plus percent of Republicans.
[00:08:48.806 --> 00:08:50.266]  So the people are also behind this.
[00:08:50.326 --> 00:08:53.747]  So I just want to support good leadership.
[00:08:54.187 --> 00:08:55.628]  I don't want to sit here and attack Abbott.
[00:08:57.788 --> 00:09:00.789]  He's learned his lesson with the COVID garbage.
[00:09:01.789 --> 00:09:04.370]  And he wasn't the worst Republican governor, but he was down there.
[00:09:05.797 --> 00:09:11.340]  So Texas seizes control of Border City Park, escalating war against illegal immigration.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.161]  That's the InfoWars.com article.
[00:09:14.362 --> 00:09:18.104]  And this isn't just some little park.
[00:09:18.144 --> 00:09:21.146]  This is a big stretch on the Rio Grande, right there at the big bridges.
[00:09:21.746 --> 00:09:27.169]  That is where the feds have their big, their main camp, the biggest on the US-Mexico border.
[00:09:29.326 --> 00:09:32.929]  It's where it's gotta be like half the illegals are coming through in the whole country.
[00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:34.930]  I mean it is crazy town.
[00:09:35.711 --> 00:09:38.894]  Tens of thousands any one given day waiting to come across.
[00:09:38.934 --> 00:09:41.476]  Thousands coming across every day conservatively.
[00:09:41.856 --> 00:09:44.438]  Some days more than 8,000 in Eagle Pass alone.
[00:09:45.138 --> 00:09:47.500]  It is crazy town.
[00:09:50.242 --> 00:09:55.266]  But the media's spinning like, oh the governor's so mean he's ignoring the city.
[00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:58.229]  Well it's city land which is state land.
[00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:07.472]  And if a city is allowing, I mean, look, Austin defunded a third of the police, crime exploded, they put the state police into Austin.
[00:10:07.512 --> 00:10:08.153]  That's the law.
[00:10:08.833 --> 00:10:12.677]  Of course, all they did was write tickets to single moms and stuff.
[00:10:12.697 --> 00:10:13.377]  I mean, I saw it.
[00:10:13.437 --> 00:10:14.158]  Disgusting.
[00:10:14.198 --> 00:10:23.485]  But that's, that's really all the state police at that level ought to do is, is, that's what they're trained to do is, you know, highway patrol and get people for intractions like that.
[00:10:25.482 --> 00:10:28.204]  The Texas Rangers do investigations, but it's a tiny organization.
[00:10:28.944 --> 00:10:32.487]  So Texas doesn't have this big, giant law enforcement operation.
[00:10:33.247 --> 00:10:34.828]  So people are like, well, the governor better do something.
[00:10:34.868 --> 00:10:35.749]  Well, I mean, he did it.
[00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:47.547]   So as we speak, We have the city down there trying to come after the governor.
[00:10:47.567 --> 00:10:48.768]  We have the feds coming after the governor.
[00:10:48.788 --> 00:10:56.631]  We have federal courts ruling that the state can't put barbed wire up or can't put these flotation bubbles in the river to block people coming in.
[00:10:57.071 --> 00:11:03.794]  We've just got to accept this giant illegal human trafficking where they don't even DNA test kids that are with adults that are clearly not even in their family.
[00:11:03.814 --> 00:11:05.615]  And they just turn them loose into the country.
[00:11:06.598 --> 00:11:08.639]  So we know where the human trafficking is going on.
[00:11:08.879 --> 00:11:16.702]  I was on a Big Spaces yesterday with millions of viewers and listeners on X. And I just said, and now we're into it, because I told them I'd do two hours.
[00:11:16.722 --> 00:11:17.362]  They're great people.
[00:11:18.162 --> 00:11:23.724]  I said, listen, I'm going to stop talking about Epstein just for the rest of this interview, because we know he was doing it.
[00:11:23.784 --> 00:11:25.165]  We know it was a lead operation.
[00:11:26.085 --> 00:11:28.886]  We know the FBI is covering up the tapes and all the hard drives.
[00:11:30.222 --> 00:11:31.423]  And it needs to be investigated.
[00:11:31.503 --> 00:11:39.908]  But we also need to deal with the completely wide open border that is a catapult shooting millions of people into the country every few months.
[00:11:41.108 --> 00:11:42.729]  And that's just who they make contact with.
[00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:45.011]  They estimate they're running into about half of them now.
[00:11:45.834 --> 00:11:46.955]  So you can double those numbers.
[00:11:47.015 --> 00:11:49.438]  Every three months, it's the city of Denver.
[00:11:49.738 --> 00:11:53.122]  800 plus thousand people that they know are coming in.
[00:11:53.242 --> 00:11:55.885]  So, yeah, we got a cut over here on our leg.
[00:11:55.945 --> 00:11:56.646]  That's Epstein.
[00:11:57.066 --> 00:11:58.908]  We got a leg chopped off that's the border.
[00:11:59.449 --> 00:12:01.912]  I'm just saying, nobody's hammered Epstein more than me.
[00:12:02.893 --> 00:12:05.135]  Nobody's talked about it more than us, literally.
[00:12:05.956 --> 00:12:16.427]  And every time I try to explain this to the audience, some people in the audience go, if I'm on a particular topic about, hey, while we're focusing on 20,000 dead Palestinians, I think it's terrible and I'm sad they're dying.
[00:12:16.868 --> 00:12:18.369]  I'm sad most of them are women and children.
[00:12:19.951 --> 00:12:23.395]  We have 17 million dead from the shots of every race, color and creed.
[00:12:24.793 --> 00:12:29.135]  And we have 80 plus million starved to death the last four years because of the COVID restrictions.
[00:12:29.775 --> 00:12:30.715]  That's a real number.
[00:12:30.755 --> 00:12:32.476]  The UN admits that.
[00:12:32.936 --> 00:12:33.796]  85 million plus?
[00:12:34.397 --> 00:12:35.337]  And they're getting ready to do it again?
[00:12:35.357 --> 00:12:37.638]  I mean, we got big stuff going on.
[00:12:37.658 --> 00:12:45.601]  And I'm glad the Epstein thing is a window into how sick the government is, and they're discredited, and people know it, and I'm going to keep covering it.
[00:12:46.441 --> 00:12:52.624]  But I sit back and I think to myself, what's really most important on human trafficking and child smuggling?
[00:12:52.664 --> 00:12:53.284]  And it's the border.
[00:12:54.993 --> 00:12:56.936]  And I'm sitting there on this big spaces yesterday.
[00:12:57.317 --> 00:13:03.527]  I'm like, yeah, we got all this footage of the same woman every hour bringing another baby with basically no paperwork to hand it over.
[00:13:03.547 --> 00:13:04.709]  It disappears and she's got.
[00:13:05.962 --> 00:13:42.279]   MS-13 type tattoos and the Grim Reaper and we've got all this other like really you really got that I said here We'll just upload it for you, and it went viral all over my real Alex Jones account as they never seen that stuff Because that's all shot last year in the year before in the year before in the year before We have hundreds of videos that have never been seen anywhere outside of band dot video And people that went to info wars comm So this this is proven The government admits in hearings, it was 85,000, the new number's over 100,000, just since they had hearings a couple months ago.
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:48.244]  Over 100,000 children they just hand over with no paperwork since Biden got in, they don't even know where they are.
[00:13:49.025 --> 00:14:00.274]  The other 500 plus thousand now, they know where they are, they go check, they're in tire factories, and sheet metal factories, and cereal factories, and meat packing factories.
[00:14:00.294 --> 00:14:01.996]  You have any idea how tough those jobs are?
[00:14:02.016 --> 00:14:04.077]  They're not even getting paid, they're sleeping on the floor.
[00:14:04.986 --> 00:14:05.907]  It's slavery!
[00:14:07.207 --> 00:14:11.129]  So, I am going to go where the big numbers are.
[00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:23.016]  And I'm telling everybody, not just me, I think we should be 10% on Epstein when we talk about human trafficking, and 90% on the open border.
[00:14:23.116 --> 00:14:30.528]   And not just here, Europe's got the same UN NGOs running a total invasion, and again, We'll open the phones up later.
[00:14:30.568 --> 00:14:31.809]  Callers disagree with me, that's fine.
[00:14:32.249 --> 00:14:38.150]  I'm out here trying to direct people on what I think the main topic should be, but we're getting more Epstein coverage than Border coverage the last month.
[00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:42.011]  And in a way, I'm like, this is kind of a distraction.
[00:14:42.191 --> 00:14:42.591]  You know what I mean?
[00:14:42.611 --> 00:14:43.432]  Because it's a dead end.
[00:14:43.472 --> 00:14:44.032]  He's dead.
[00:14:44.452 --> 00:14:45.252]  She's in prison.
[00:14:45.672 --> 00:14:46.873]  The FBI is covering it up.
[00:14:47.193 --> 00:14:48.193]  I want the stuff released.
[00:14:49.093 --> 00:14:50.594]  But we've got them here.
[00:14:51.074 --> 00:14:51.474]  All right.
[00:14:51.774 --> 00:14:55.495]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Friday edition.
[00:14:56.397 --> 00:14:59.158]  We're not far out from the 2024 election now.
[00:14:59.178 --> 00:15:02.239]  We've got big news on that front coming up next segment.
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:07.861]  Oh yeah, the judge didn't just find Trump guilty in New York before the trial began and said so.
[00:15:08.381 --> 00:15:12.583]  Letitia James, the Attorney General run by Soros, said so in a bunch of speeches.
[00:15:13.583 --> 00:15:17.085]  Trump was able to never put on any evidence that he was innocent and no closing arguments.
[00:15:17.805 --> 00:15:22.207]  Same thing happened to me in both Connecticut and in Texas.
[00:15:23.987 --> 00:15:24.887]  No closing argument.
[00:15:25.368 --> 00:15:25.848]  No defense.
[00:15:27.469 --> 00:15:28.430]  Where you're already found guilty.
[00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:30.851]  That's the weaponization.
[00:15:30.911 --> 00:15:32.572]  And everybody asked me, Alex, how are you taking it?
[00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:35.754]  And I said, I want to explain this again.
[00:15:35.774 --> 00:15:39.136]  I have been chosen as the beta test.
[00:15:39.156 --> 00:15:46.740]  So whatever happens to me first will then happen to anybody fighting the globalists, whether it's Donald Trump, Elon Musk, you name it.
[00:15:47.921 --> 00:15:57.881]   And that's why this broadcast is so important, is because they see in it What a vampire sees in the sun, their destruction.
[00:15:58.341 --> 00:16:06.266]  And it's not me, it's the guests, it's the callers, it's the stories, it's the crew, it's this broadcast focusing on what's really happening.
[00:16:07.547 --> 00:16:19.355]  Because you look at all the thousands of fake ideologies and all the disinformation, all the garbage, you tune into this show 25 years ago, or 10 years ago, or a year ago, you're getting next week, next year's news today.
[00:16:20.635 --> 00:16:28.238]  So, it's common sense, I've been saying, Governor Abbott has to go and has to kick the feds out.
[00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:38.221]  And they can jurisdictionally claim that they have the area right on the border, depending on where the lines have been drawn, but the state can set up behind that and grab people and deport them.
[00:16:38.721 --> 00:16:47.524]  But it's going to take money, and the governor would have to ask all the retired state police to come back and do a year of duty.
[00:16:48.757 --> 00:16:59.745]  And then he'd have to have a fast track program to ask veterans, even young veterans, 25 years old, to go through a quick course and get down there.
[00:17:00.826 --> 00:17:03.228]  And the governor is now moving in that direction.
[00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:27.247]   Two days ago, he directed the state police and the Texas National Guard, the state militia, To go to the border, I've got the statements here where he said the federal government is not just derelict in its duty, it is aiding and abetting the invasion of Texas and the United States and causing massive crime and property damage and costs to the citizens.
[00:17:28.308 --> 00:17:30.270]  And it violates and he listed a bunch of the laws.
[00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.151]  It's all true.
[00:17:31.931 --> 00:17:35.095]  And so now Greg Abbott has done what everybody asked him to do.
[00:17:35.535 --> 00:17:38.338]  He started at Eagle Pass, which is the biggest point.
[00:17:40.199 --> 00:17:44.246]  Where the majority in the whole state are coming in, and Texas is the most open state.
[00:17:44.687 --> 00:17:47.031]  The biggest right there on the border.
[00:17:47.071 --> 00:17:50.217]  That's where the UN and the NGOs are setting the caravans up.
[00:17:50.257 --> 00:17:51.580]  So, Greg Abbott!
[00:17:52.827 --> 00:18:09.857]  You need to send him an email, you need to call him, you need to call your state representatives, you need to thank them, just like you need to thank Paxton and others, and you need to, as citizen journalists, have a Twitter account, have a Facebook, whatever, you need to get down there and just aim a camera, and it'll all get out to the public, just like we've done.
[00:18:10.358 --> 00:18:20.564]  It's like shooting fish in a barrel, and I don't mean shoot anybody, I mean, you get there, human smugglers, vans picking up kids, people handing over children that aren't their parents, I mean, it is head-spinning.
[00:18:21.533 --> 00:18:26.636]  It'll make you dizzy when you go down Eagle Pass or McAllen or Brownsville.
[00:18:26.996 --> 00:18:28.917]  You can't go 10 feet without it.
[00:18:29.538 --> 00:18:36.842]  There'll be buses, taxis, vans, planes taking off, little kids everywhere without their parents.
[00:18:37.462 --> 00:18:38.503]  It is disgusting.
[00:18:39.663 --> 00:18:42.585]  And it has just exploded under Biden.
[00:18:42.845 --> 00:18:45.306]  Trump shut it 99% down.
[00:18:47.908 --> 00:18:49.809]  Obama accelerated it and started it.
[00:18:51.328 --> 00:18:53.669]  And then as soon as Biden got in, he said, just surge the border.
[00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:58.612]  Texas blocks federal border agents from processing migrants.
[00:18:58.792 --> 00:18:59.732]  That's, again, under the U.N.
[00:18:59.772 --> 00:18:59.932]  treaty.
[00:18:59.952 --> 00:19:00.432]  It's a key word.
[00:19:00.472 --> 00:19:01.233]  No, they're illegal aliens.
[00:19:01.733 --> 00:19:02.273]  And the U.N.
[00:19:02.453 --> 00:19:05.255]  has a treaty that was never ratified, but Biden follows it.
[00:19:05.635 --> 00:19:06.455]  Trump pulled out of it.
[00:19:07.076 --> 00:19:08.997]  But they're in charge, and they decide who comes through.
[00:19:09.017 --> 00:19:10.497]  And they said everybody comes through.
[00:19:11.338 --> 00:19:15.019]  Texas state officials this week abruptly blocked federal U.S.
[00:19:15.059 --> 00:19:17.881]  border agents, who, by the way, aren't bad people on average.
[00:19:17.901 --> 00:19:18.241]  They like it.
[00:19:20.799 --> 00:19:23.382]  Texas state officials this week abruptly blocked federal U.S.
[00:19:23.422 --> 00:19:36.136]  Border Patrol agents from entering and patrolling a public area in the border town of Eagle Pass, where they typically first encounter migrants, that's illegal aliens, who cross the Rio Grande illegally.
[00:19:36.616 --> 00:19:37.057]  Two U.S.
[00:19:37.117 --> 00:19:39.439]  officials told CBS News on Thursday.
[00:19:40.339 --> 00:19:41.460]  This all started yesterday.
[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:42.280]  We've got the footage.
[00:19:42.761 --> 00:19:43.561]  It's all unfolding.
[00:19:43.861 --> 00:19:47.541]   At receiving control of Shelby Park and Eagle Pass, Texas National Guard units
[00:19:47.541 --> 00:19:52.101]   deployed by Republican Governor Greg Abbott have prevented Border Patrol agents from entering the
[00:19:52.101 --> 00:19:57.941]   area. The federal official said Border Patrol has used the park in recent weeks to hold illegal
[00:19:57.941 --> 00:20:04.501]   aliens in an outdoor staging area before they are transported for further processing, including last
[00:20:04.501 --> 00:20:13.301]   month when illegal crossings soared to record levels of up to 18,000 a day. In the normally
[00:20:13.301 --> 00:20:14.700]  most down time of the year.
[00:20:15.535 --> 00:20:20.357]  Earlier Thursday, Texas state officials prevented border patrol agents from patrolling the area.
[00:20:20.977 --> 00:20:25.199]  One of the officials said requesting anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press.
[00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:29.741]  They're denying entry to the border agents to conduct our duties.
[00:20:29.821 --> 00:20:31.042]  What, to smuggle illegals in?
[00:20:31.362 --> 00:20:36.464]  The official said, noting they are not sure what authority Texas officials have over the federal government.
[00:20:36.944 --> 00:20:38.785]  Well, read the Declaration of Independence, Bubba.
[00:20:39.906 --> 00:20:45.588]   When the government becomes destructive of the people, It is not just our right, it is our duty to abolish it.
[00:20:46.329 --> 00:20:49.071]  But we're not abolishing the federal government, it's been hijacked.
[00:20:49.611 --> 00:21:12.709]  And so as long as you're following illegal orders, and as long as Congress refuses to cut the funding to facilitate this and turn the border into a magnet and an accelerator, a turbocharger, to mortar illegal aliens across the United States, to cannon them in, well, then that's just the way it is.
[00:21:14.289 --> 00:21:28.493]  And I've been there, Owen's been there, Drew Hernandez has been there working with us, you've seen all the footage, where they'll walk right over to Owen, 50 yards from the border gate, all the illegals are milling around, and they'll tell Owen, get out of here!
[00:21:29.173 --> 00:21:33.774]  And they'll start shoving into him, and they'll bump our cars with their vehicles, and you've got the U.S.
[00:21:33.854 --> 00:21:36.995]  military bugging their eyes out at citizens.
[00:21:38.055 --> 00:21:46.272]   And you've seen Owen, and you've seen Michael Yan get in their face, And some of our other reporters down there, our own security guys, are veterans, and they stay quiet.
[00:21:46.292 --> 00:21:49.134]  In fact, guys, see if Duke can find that footage, I want to show that.
[00:21:49.754 --> 00:22:02.362]  Went viral, even when we were not on X, about a year ago when it happened, and our own reporter, our own security guy, I forget his name, he only comes in part-time, big Hispanic guy, Army veteran.
[00:22:03.103 --> 00:22:05.464]  He gets to their face, he says, hey man, what's your duty here?
[00:22:05.484 --> 00:22:06.925]  I want to talk to your commanding officer.
[00:22:07.726 --> 00:22:09.227]  And the military starts cussing at him.
[00:22:10.256 --> 00:22:11.257]  And said, get out of my face.
[00:22:11.277 --> 00:22:12.297]  He said, I'm not in your face.
[00:22:12.717 --> 00:22:14.038]  You're here smuggling kids across.
[00:22:14.078 --> 00:22:14.878]  What the hell are you doing?
[00:22:14.898 --> 00:22:18.040]  I mean, we just got the most insane footage ever.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.121]  I know Owen's on well-deserved vacation.
[00:22:21.141 --> 00:22:22.142]  He'll know the name of the video.
[00:22:22.782 --> 00:22:25.483]  So call him if we can't find... Oh, this is it right here.
[00:22:25.884 --> 00:22:32.907]  Watch veteran confront Texas National Guard for failing to obey Governor Abbott's order to stop the flow of illegal immigrants.
[00:22:34.448 --> 00:22:34.648]  So...
[00:22:36.224 --> 00:22:40.187]  I want to re-upload that right now, because what's old is new.
[00:22:40.227 --> 00:22:41.809]  Because when this came out, we weren't on eggs.
[00:22:42.869 --> 00:22:45.151]  Although other people put it out at millions of views.
[00:22:45.211 --> 00:22:52.197]  I want to put this out so people can see what's going on, and to hear how smart-mouthed the US military is to citizens.
[00:22:52.237 --> 00:22:54.439]  Now, they're not all like this, but more and more they are.
[00:22:55.259 --> 00:23:07.039]   I'd say, guessing, the officers, maybe 30% are woke libtards now, and the enlisted, I've not run to any of them.
[00:23:07.839 --> 00:23:09.821]  I'd say Border Patrol used to be 100% on our side.
[00:23:09.841 --> 00:23:12.262]  10% are leptards now, folks.
[00:23:12.922 --> 00:23:16.164]  And can you imagine if they get all their people in the positions?
[00:23:17.065 --> 00:23:17.825]  It is bad.
[00:23:18.626 --> 00:23:19.927]  So right now there is no border.
[00:23:21.548 --> 00:23:22.948]  It's like saying, well, I don't have skin on my arm.
[00:23:22.988 --> 00:23:24.209]  It's worse than not even having the skin.
[00:23:24.229 --> 00:23:25.870]  It's like having your arm chopped off.
[00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:31.954]  I mean, the border is a weapon now formed against us to pump in Democrat voters.
[00:23:32.634 --> 00:23:33.835]  Many bovines die.
[00:23:36.831 --> 00:23:41.074]  You can see here the Great Awakening orbiting the Great Reset.
[00:23:41.794 --> 00:23:51.540]  Although the depopulation systems of the Great Reset are not yet fully operational, the Great Reset does have a strong conspiracy network.
[00:23:52.001 --> 00:23:57.864]  It is protected by a satanic shield, which can be disabled by the Great Awakening.
[00:23:58.285 --> 00:24:04.509]  The Great Reset must be deactivated if any victory for humanity is to be accomplished.
[00:24:05.521 --> 00:24:19.566]  Once the Great Awakening deactivates the shield, InfoWars.com forward slash show will cover the truth while Info Warriors fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the Great Reset.
[00:24:20.066 --> 00:24:23.787]  Alex Jones has volunteered to lead the fighter attack.
[00:24:24.147 --> 00:24:29.569]  Get a signed copy of the Great Awakening today at InfoWarsStore.com!
[00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:37.291]  In a moment, we're going to go through some of the local newscast in Texas, where the state guard has been sent in by the governor.
[00:24:37.951 --> 00:24:39.431]  There's basically a showdown going on.
[00:24:39.471 --> 00:24:45.472]  The state has thrown the feds off the border in Eagle Pass, and more state militia are moving in.
[00:24:47.273 --> 00:24:50.293]  And one way or another, we're going to be at the border the next week.
[00:24:50.613 --> 00:24:51.333]  Okay, that's it.
[00:24:52.414 --> 00:24:54.814]  So look for that, and I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:24:56.294 --> 00:24:57.334]  More coming up in a moment.
[00:24:58.275 --> 00:24:59.815]  We need funds to do this, though.
[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:03.823]  And InfoWars is barely in the black, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:04.403 --> 00:25:08.006]  And I told you when we went into bankruptcy over a year ago, we were going to stay on air and we have and we will.
[00:25:09.628 --> 00:25:11.309]  If you buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:19.837]  But listen, these products are absolutely amazing.
[00:25:19.977 --> 00:25:25.141]  Somebody took my bottle of Next Level Foundational Energy Methylfolate out of here.
[00:25:25.181 --> 00:25:26.543]  Will somebody go grab me a bottle of that, thanks.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.362]  These products are insanely powerful.
[00:25:31.442 --> 00:25:33.844]  They're all the very best out there.
[00:25:35.965 --> 00:25:38.247]  And you need to go try them.
[00:25:38.367 --> 00:25:43.070]  Now, I don't know particularly what deficiencies you've got, what your genetics are, what your issues are.
[00:25:43.531 --> 00:25:45.752]  But all these products will do great things for you.
[00:25:46.513 --> 00:25:49.335]  But if you are deficient in these, go ahead and bring it to me.
[00:25:49.435 --> 00:25:49.915]  It's right there.
[00:25:49.935 --> 00:25:50.355]  It's right on there.
[00:25:50.376 --> 00:25:50.616]  Thank you.
[00:25:53.433 --> 00:26:15.692]  If you are deficient in this stuff and you take it, whether it's X2, or Next Level Foundational Energy, or Winter Sun, or Ultra 12, or the fish oil or the krill oil, you will see dramatic things for your body, your energy, your immune system, your skin, your sex life, everything!
[00:26:17.469 --> 00:26:18.410]  You've heard callers calling.
[00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:19.651]  By the way, we're sold out of it right now.
[00:26:19.931 --> 00:26:21.032]  We have more coming in a few months.
[00:26:21.673 --> 00:26:23.415]  And they're like, man, you're Prostagard.
[00:26:23.455 --> 00:26:25.276]  I tried other things and nothing helped.
[00:26:25.296 --> 00:26:28.419]  I even tried stuff doctors gave me that didn't help, but my prostate problems went away.
[00:26:28.459 --> 00:26:36.867]  Well, even the FDA admits, and they have no jurisdiction over supplements, that Shaw Palmetto absolutely does great things for your prostate.
[00:26:37.188 --> 00:26:38.409]  That's just one of the things we saw.
[00:26:39.972 --> 00:26:42.093]  Everything we sell is amazing.
[00:26:42.733 --> 00:26:47.415]  People go, wow, I went and looked at the ratings on the gravity-fed stainless steel water filters you sell.
[00:26:47.836 --> 00:26:50.157]  They are the highest rated out there.
[00:26:50.497 --> 00:26:53.958]  How are they half the price of other top-rated systems?
[00:26:53.978 --> 00:26:57.380]  Because there's hundreds of systems and there's only four or five that have the highest rating.
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.501]  It just cuts everything out to non-detectable levels.
[00:27:01.482 --> 00:27:03.743]  And I go, well, we just found the best company at the lowest price.
[00:27:04.796 --> 00:27:08.819]  And maybe I should sell the unit that costs twice as much.
[00:27:08.899 --> 00:27:10.060]  Then we wouldn't have money problems.
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.361]  But I don't do that.
[00:27:12.441 --> 00:27:14.323]  I bring you the very best.
[00:27:14.503 --> 00:27:16.544]  InfowarStore.com.
[00:27:17.325 --> 00:27:18.746]  Now, the sale has to end.
[00:27:18.766 --> 00:27:23.329]  It needed to end days ago, but so much stuff is sold out or selling out.
[00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:27.772]  But I promise you this, because I do have some new specials for next week.
[00:27:28.152 --> 00:27:31.402]   They're not as Wide-reaching is this, but they're good.
[00:27:31.982 --> 00:27:35.303]  But this is our best sell of the year, the Christmas sale, the New Year.
[00:27:36.163 --> 00:27:37.283]  That's always the best time of year.
[00:27:37.303 --> 00:27:38.324]  That's always our best deals.
[00:27:39.224 --> 00:27:40.344]  Now is the time to take action.
[00:27:40.384 --> 00:27:43.826]  Today, Saturday, and Sunday.
[00:27:43.866 --> 00:27:51.828]  Because Monday, it will end the storewide free shipping, the double Patriot points, and a whole bunch of these sales we've got will be gone.
[00:27:52.688 --> 00:27:52.968]  Okay?
[00:27:54.289 --> 00:27:57.490]  We've got a few new products that have been sold out for a while, coming back in in a month or so.
[00:27:58.686 --> 00:28:00.507]  But right now is the time to get these products.
[00:28:00.547 --> 00:28:01.588]  Game-changing products.

[00:28:44.483 --> 00:28:46.104]  You're like, well, why are you about to sell out?
[00:28:46.124 --> 00:28:47.225]  A lot of these won't be back in for months.
[00:28:47.265 --> 00:28:47.725]  Are you doing it?
[00:28:47.805 --> 00:28:49.706]  Because you buy it when I discount it.
[00:28:49.746 --> 00:28:50.627]  So it's a catch 22.
[00:28:50.967 --> 00:28:52.448]  I've got to have the funds.
[00:28:52.528 --> 00:28:54.329]  Plus, these are amazing products.
[00:28:54.669 --> 00:28:55.670]  A perfect storm.
[00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:57.071]  Take action now.
[00:28:57.631 --> 00:28:58.992]  Some of this stuff is lost leader.
[00:29:00.052 --> 00:29:02.974]  But we got to get the money in to order the new product and get it back in.
[00:29:03.294 --> 00:29:07.436]  And we have some new products coming out because I want to hire five or six reporters and camera people.
[00:29:07.877 --> 00:29:11.459]  I want to go back to where we were a few years ago before we shrunk.
[00:29:12.261 --> 00:29:15.043]  Because if you're not getting bigger, you're going to be getting smaller.
[00:29:15.083 --> 00:29:18.965]  There is no equilibrium in the information war or in life.
[00:29:19.305 --> 00:29:19.985]  We all know that.
[00:29:20.406 --> 00:29:22.847]  Things very rarely just stand still unless they're a rock.
[00:29:23.908 --> 00:29:32.893]  So, go to infowarestore.com and get TurboForce, get Next Level Foundational Energy, also get the great InfoWars Platinum product.
[00:29:32.933 --> 00:29:39.177]  It's a private label, the national bestseller, vetted, tested, loved, naturally boost HGH to your body, the real fountain of youth.
[00:29:39.737 --> 00:29:41.378]  HGH Max Boost is selling out.
[00:29:43.951 --> 00:29:45.152]  Despite that, it's discounted.
[00:29:45.452 --> 00:29:46.914]  InfowarStore.com.
[00:29:47.034 --> 00:29:49.296]  It takes money to fuel the InfoWar.
[00:29:50.157 --> 00:29:53.200]  So we sell you products that you're going to love, that are going to give you a great result.
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.441]  So you order them again.
[00:29:54.501 --> 00:29:55.842]  It's a symbiotic relationship.
[00:29:56.223 --> 00:29:57.644]  We treat people like we want to be treated.
[00:29:58.205 --> 00:29:59.266]  And look, it's great.
[00:29:59.886 --> 00:30:02.348]  Less than 1% of our listeners buy the products.
[00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:03.950]  That's fine.
[00:30:04.871 --> 00:30:08.755]  But if just 2% bought them, we would double in size and do incredible things.
[00:30:09.628 --> 00:30:14.812]  All right, so I'm struggling for budgets to be at the RNC and DNC and Bilderberg, and we're not at Davos.
[00:30:14.832 --> 00:30:15.512]  We don't have the money.
[00:30:16.113 --> 00:30:21.357]  We reach 100 million people, change the world, expose their agenda, confront world leaders like Rebel News does.
[00:30:21.877 --> 00:30:22.377]  Don't have the money.
[00:30:23.378 --> 00:30:24.259]  I'm not bitching.
[00:30:24.839 --> 00:30:26.760]  I'm saying put me in the game, coach.
[00:30:28.161 --> 00:30:32.324]  Go to MFOWarStore.com and get the products.
[00:30:32.785 --> 00:30:37.408]  Get a copy of my book, The Great Awakening, either signed or unsigned.
[00:30:37.448 --> 00:30:38.229]  That's a fundraiser.
[00:30:39.508 --> 00:30:55.735]  And part of that proceed goes to me, which is the weak link in this, because the bankruptcy court said a year ago plus, Mr. Jones, because of the fake numbers they gave him that I had all this money, which wasn't true, never gotten changed, they said Mr. Jones can pay half the legal bills.
[00:30:57.008 --> 00:31:04.674]  Well, sold my house, sold my car, my guns go on sale, which only raised like 60 grand, I think, it's not that many guns, next week.
[00:31:04.934 --> 00:31:09.057]  I mean, I'm literally putting everything in to keep this going.
[00:31:09.497 --> 00:31:16.542]   How you help me is you go to InfoWarsTore.com and you get The Great Awakening, a signed copy.
[00:31:16.622 --> 00:31:17.462]  It's a fundraiser.
[00:31:17.782 --> 00:31:18.723]  Or an unsigned copy.
[00:31:19.083 --> 00:31:22.864]  But the judge said, I can have some of the proceeds from that.
[00:31:23.745 --> 00:31:24.985]  Thank you very much, Your Honor.
[00:31:25.766 --> 00:31:26.526]  And I'm serious.
[00:31:26.546 --> 00:31:31.568]  Compared to the other judges, it's... I wouldn't say there's any love going on, but at least she's not...
[00:31:32.568 --> 00:31:34.609]  None of the stuff the other judges did at the state level yet.
[00:31:35.169 --> 00:31:36.810]  And if it does, that's just in God's hands.
[00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:39.872]  But I'm just going to keep going forward, and I need your support right now.
[00:31:39.912 --> 00:31:40.492]  That's critical.
[00:31:40.872 --> 00:31:45.334]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com and get The Great Awakening if you want to keep me on the air.
[00:31:46.295 --> 00:31:46.635]  All right.
[00:31:49.836 --> 00:31:50.917]  Let's skip this break coming up.
[00:31:53.418 --> 00:31:57.080]  I want to finish up with the border, and I just want to be clear.
[00:31:58.755 --> 00:32:00.756]  It's become fashionable to hate Greg Abbott.
[00:32:01.317 --> 00:32:03.818]  And I went protesting more than 10 times.
[00:32:04.459 --> 00:32:06.820]  And the state police were complete jerks to us last time.
[00:32:08.141 --> 00:32:09.482]  And pulled over all our cars.
[00:32:10.643 --> 00:32:12.844]  And demanded to see our insurance, of course we had it.
[00:32:13.544 --> 00:32:15.005]  And were total jerks.
[00:32:16.306 --> 00:32:18.488]  Because I know, it's open season on citizens, I get it.
[00:32:19.048 --> 00:32:21.890]  And they want to protect the governor, and how dare me go up and bullhorn at the gates.
[00:32:23.072 --> 00:32:25.673]  I was telling him last time, will you do something about the damn border?
[00:32:26.093 --> 00:32:34.655]  Will you send in the state guard and block the feds and you need to call for an emergency session in the legislature and you need to levy some state tax.
[00:32:34.735 --> 00:32:36.416]  That's what taxes are for, is emergencies.
[00:32:37.336 --> 00:32:41.057]  George Washington levied one and you need to do full mobilization.
[00:32:41.958 --> 00:32:42.678]  Well, it started.
[00:32:43.918 --> 00:32:46.219]  And I wouldn't even say small, though compared to what we need, it's small.
[00:32:46.719 --> 00:32:49.500]  So, that's what's going on here.
[00:32:50.846 --> 00:32:57.190]  And the governor's listening, so we've got to be thankful that he's not being a jerk.
[00:32:58.311 --> 00:33:05.576]  And he's actually made a bold move, because you don't see other governors having the state guard go up and throw the feds off the border.
[00:33:06.276 --> 00:33:07.897]  After he put up barbed wire and they cut it down.
[00:33:08.298 --> 00:33:10.399]  After he put up water barriers and they pulled it down.
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:14.201]  And then federal judges ordered him to take it down and Abbott told him, screw you.
[00:33:16.496 --> 00:33:19.818]  And then a lot of, you know, patriots said, why don't you shoot illegals?
[00:33:19.878 --> 00:33:24.922]  Well, look, most of these are families, refugees from the globalists locking their countries down.
[00:33:24.942 --> 00:33:25.663]  They're just victims.
[00:33:25.903 --> 00:33:27.064]  They're being used as a weapon system.
[00:33:27.344 --> 00:33:30.806]  And Abbott said, we would be indicted for murder by the feds if we shot them.
[00:33:31.507 --> 00:33:33.228]  It's the cartels killing these people, not us.
[00:33:34.069 --> 00:33:36.971]  And now the media spun that, that he wants to shoot the illegal aliens.
[00:33:37.451 --> 00:33:40.854]  Well, you can't fire a lot of examples of Americans shooting illegals.
[00:33:41.654 --> 00:33:45.357]  99% of the stuff is being done by the coyotes and on their side of the border.
[00:33:46.641 --> 00:33:56.484]  Only place you see people in cowboy hats and Anglos shooting, you know, pregnant women is in Robert Rodriguez movies financed by the Obama administration.
[00:33:56.784 --> 00:34:01.705]  Shows like Machete, race-based anti-white garbage.
[00:34:02.305 --> 00:34:05.126]  But of course it is, it's all run by the CIA.
[00:34:05.666 --> 00:34:07.647]  So here's one of the local newscasts about what's happening.
[00:34:08.646 --> 00:34:12.987]  Rio Grande River has served as a landing point for illegals crossing into the U.S.
[00:34:13.007 --> 00:34:14.088]  for more than two years.
[00:34:14.828 --> 00:34:17.209]  This means not even the feds can patrol there.
[00:34:17.709 --> 00:34:20.490]  Matt Finn, live in Eagle Pass, to tell us how it's going.
[00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:23.671]  I guess this is day one or day two, Matt.
[00:34:23.691 --> 00:34:24.091]  Good morning.
[00:34:26.426 --> 00:34:32.131]  Essentially day two, this all started developing yesterday, Bill, and it's a rather remarkable situation.
[00:34:32.171 --> 00:34:35.554]  Behind me right now is Shelby Park, the park that you were referring to.
[00:34:35.614 --> 00:34:44.521]   Our viewers may recognize that our cameras have been here for about two years now, showing you the mass illegal immigration That happens right here in this park.
[00:34:44.561 --> 00:34:50.124]  You might recall even just a few weeks ago, there was that huge surge of migrants who crossed right here.
[00:34:50.444 --> 00:35:04.791]  Well, now under Governor Abbott's emergency declaration, the Texas National Guard has seized control of this park and some surrounding land along the river, put up fencing and razor wire, and kicked out federal Border Patrol agents.
[00:35:05.331 --> 00:35:13.678]  Arguing that it's the Biden administration that has perpetuated illegal crossings, so Texas is going to control this land from here on out.
[00:35:14.198 --> 00:35:21.424]  Our crews have seen what appears to be Texas National Guard blocking Border Patrol agents from key areas of the operation here.
[00:35:21.864 --> 00:35:28.309]  And senior Border Patrol agents confirmed to Fox News that BP has pooled resources to avoid a confrontation.
[00:35:28.809 --> 00:35:45.373]  Now, it's not quite clear if this unprecedented move by Texas is really going to help or harm illegal migration here because it appears that ultimately when migrants arrive to this park, Texas National Guard is still going to have to turn them over for processing to Border Patrol, essentially adding an extra step.
[00:35:45.953 --> 00:35:50.555]  Another added layer, the mayor of Eagle Pass says he was completely caught off guard by this move.
[00:35:50.595 --> 00:35:55.316]  He does not agree with his park being taken over and is looking into his legal options.
[00:35:56.513 --> 00:36:01.737]  This is not something that the city wanted, requested, asked for.
[00:36:02.417 --> 00:36:06.640]  He made it clear that this is the state and that they have the legal authority to do that.
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:12.104]  Of course, our legal team is looking into the actions taken by the states.
[00:36:15.506 --> 00:36:18.068]  We will be here outside of the park over the next couple days.
[00:36:18.108 --> 00:36:20.429]  We'll keep you updated on how the situation unfolds.
[00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:22.691]  So it's a good start.
[00:36:23.649 --> 00:36:26.592]  And the media spins it like, oh, now they're just gonna let them in.
[00:36:26.632 --> 00:36:27.412]  That's not what's happening.
[00:36:27.432 --> 00:36:28.313]  They're telling them to go back.
[00:36:29.034 --> 00:36:34.438]  And once the illegals see they're being stopped, they'll stop accelerating the invasion that's exponential.
[00:36:35.419 --> 00:36:38.402]  But let's start with Fox News not calling them migrants.
[00:36:39.763 --> 00:36:40.524]  That's a U.N.
[00:36:40.584 --> 00:36:41.504]  treaty, a U.N.
[00:36:41.565 --> 00:36:41.865]  term.
[00:36:44.087 --> 00:36:45.588]   Where it means the U.N.' 's in control.
[00:36:45.708 --> 00:36:55.731]  They are illegal aliens, told to come here by the President, and they're given NGO and federal money to do it, and there's massive human trafficking of kidnapped children.
[00:36:56.592 --> 00:37:03.114]  It's a giant crime scene of Democrat Party replacement voters.
[00:37:05.135 --> 00:37:05.575]  That's it.
[00:37:06.916 --> 00:37:08.876]  So, the state's not all powerful, folks.
[00:37:08.916 --> 00:37:09.637]  Neither are the feds.
[00:37:10.357 --> 00:37:11.417]  They need our support.
[00:37:11.437 --> 00:37:12.558]  I was just talking to Owen during the break.
[00:37:13.817 --> 00:37:15.558]  And I said, Owen, can you go down there next week?
[00:37:16.278 --> 00:37:29.543]  He said, boss, don't you forget, until the 23rd of February, he has a travel ban under the terms of his release from federal prison for peacefully covering January 6th.
[00:37:31.724 --> 00:37:34.365]  My 60-day travel ban ends February 25th.
[00:37:37.108 --> 00:37:38.348]  This country is so screwed.
[00:37:38.529 --> 00:37:39.689]  I mean, look, perfect example.
[00:37:39.729 --> 00:37:42.110]  Owen Schroeder, peaceful at the Capitol, says don't go in.
[00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:43.690]  60 days in prison.
[00:37:44.531 --> 00:37:53.214]  They let him out after 45 days, and they say, you can't travel anywhere for a couple months.
[00:37:53.574 --> 00:37:57.055]  But, oh, you can go see your family, but you can't go to the border.
[00:37:57.615 --> 00:38:04.898]  It's just anything they can do to frustrate us and to stop us from doing it.
[00:38:06.786 --> 00:38:07.907]  People say, well, why don't you go to the border?
[00:38:07.987 --> 00:38:13.169]  Well, my wife's been taking care of her dad, who's had a bunch of heart attacks and is, bounces back.
[00:38:13.189 --> 00:38:17.191]  The guy's tough, but I mean, you know, he's been living with us and that's been going on.
[00:38:17.612 --> 00:38:19.413]  And, but I just assumed I have to go down to the border.
[00:38:20.073 --> 00:38:20.953]  So it's fine.
[00:38:20.973 --> 00:38:21.354]  I'll do it.
[00:38:21.834 --> 00:38:25.056]  But it just, we need to get a bunch of reporters.
[00:38:25.136 --> 00:38:26.797]  I mean, this is going to be an ongoing crisis.
[00:38:27.777 --> 00:38:35.951]   I need at least three reporters and three more camera people and That comes down to you supporting the broadcast, but we're almost there.
[00:38:36.372 --> 00:38:39.335]  In fact, we've got the budget to hire one more crew member, another camera person.
[00:38:39.875 --> 00:38:44.801]  We're all tied down here with the live shows, the events, and everything we're doing.
[00:38:44.821 --> 00:38:45.501]  I'm not complaining.
[00:38:45.541 --> 00:38:49.726]  It's just that I don't want InfoWars to just be a talk show.
[00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:55.573]  What we do is go out and report, and then it reaches hundreds of millions of people because we know what to do.
[00:38:56.134 --> 00:38:56.974]  We know where to go.
[00:38:56.994 --> 00:39:02.218]  We don't just stand there in a park and say, behind me is the park, and the migrants are here, blah, blah, blah.
[00:39:02.238 --> 00:39:05.180]  We show you the smuggling, the human trafficking, we deliver.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:14.841]   In fact, speaking of that, that video I asked you guys to get, one of our great security guys, Uh, when they were being rude to Owen and being pushy.
[00:39:15.401 --> 00:39:16.642]  We're not going to play the whole 20 minute clip.
[00:39:16.662 --> 00:39:17.582]  There's a couple minutes of it.
[00:39:18.102 --> 00:39:19.723]  Gets in the face of the U.S.
[00:39:19.823 --> 00:39:22.064]  Army, uh, who's being smart mouth.
[00:39:22.024 --> 00:39:41.944]  and here that is.
[00:39:41.966 --> 00:39:44.127]  And I know what the orders were put forth.
[00:39:44.147 --> 00:39:47.169]  I know what orders were put out by the Governor.
[00:39:47.229 --> 00:39:48.189]  Who is your chief?
[00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:50.110]  He is your chief.
[00:39:51.138 --> 00:39:53.399]  You're commander in chief, and you don't know what you're talking about.
[00:39:53.459 --> 00:39:54.280]  I'm not rolling my eyes.
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:59.103]  But you guys don't understand, because you guys are in full active duty, like Elvis, what an order is.
[00:39:59.123 --> 00:40:03.445]  Alright, so we're all pieces of shit, because we're not... No, no, no, no, no, but... No, we're all pieces of shit, man.
[00:40:03.545 --> 00:40:06.867]  I'm not in the fucking mood, so you should just talk to the guy.
[00:40:06.927 --> 00:40:07.307]  No, partner.
[00:40:07.567 --> 00:40:09.568]  What you need to do is follow the orders the governor set forth.
[00:40:09.849 --> 00:40:12.210]  That's what you need to do, because that's your job at Texas A&M University.
[00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:13.711]  How come you're not wearing a uniform?
[00:40:13.731 --> 00:40:14.971]  I already did my job.
[00:40:15.132 --> 00:40:16.012]  And I'm doing mine.
[00:40:16.172 --> 00:40:19.494]  Right, to follow the orders of the governor, but you guys haven't done it.
[00:40:19.674 --> 00:40:21.494]  We're facilitating buses.
[00:40:22.395 --> 00:40:26.456]  The governor said in order to slow down the influx of illegal immigrants.
[00:40:26.556 --> 00:40:27.376]  You guys aren't doing that.
[00:40:27.796 --> 00:40:29.636]  Where's your pride in following orders, man?
[00:40:30.576 --> 00:40:31.056]  Come on, man.
[00:40:31.077 --> 00:40:35.277]  You're wearing a uniform to say and represent the state of Texas, not Border Patrol.
[00:40:35.698 --> 00:40:36.978]  Have some pride, gentlemen.
[00:40:37.398 --> 00:40:38.418]  The governor spoke.
[00:40:38.538 --> 00:40:39.698]  You need to follow those orders.
[00:40:39.818 --> 00:40:41.479]  Thank you.
[00:40:41.379 --> 00:40:43.379]  That's what we do.
[00:40:43.379 --> 00:40:48.879]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:40:48.879 --> 00:40:50.019]  All right, let's stop right here.
[00:40:50.026 --> 00:40:51.147]  Again, I was going from memory.
[00:40:51.187 --> 00:40:52.368]  I haven't played this in over a year.
[00:40:53.769 --> 00:40:54.989]  That's the state guard.
[00:40:55.009 --> 00:40:57.471]  That's when I got really mad at Abbott because that's the state guard.
[00:40:57.491 --> 00:41:02.035]  And there's a bunch of other stuff where they smart off, pull their trucks up in front of us.
[00:41:02.535 --> 00:41:08.199]  So at least the governor doesn't have the state guard now down there facilitating it.
[00:41:08.219 --> 00:41:13.083]  They've been putting up barbed wire, they've been putting up devices, flotation devices to block the river.
[00:41:14.131 --> 00:41:16.194]  They've been now blocking the Feds off of the river.
[00:41:16.274 --> 00:41:19.257]  I mean, this is a real confrontation building.
[00:41:19.297 --> 00:41:22.040]  And so now, the Border Patrol's had to pull back.
[00:41:22.121 --> 00:41:25.605]  And so instead of having 10,000 a day build up, you're going to see 20, 30, 40, 50,000.
[00:41:26.165 --> 00:41:27.086]  And that's good.
[00:41:27.146 --> 00:41:28.768]  Let's see it for what it is.
[00:41:30.791 --> 00:41:31.712]  Let's witness it.
[00:41:34.121 --> 00:41:34.841]  For what it is.
[00:41:35.021 --> 00:41:35.241]  All right.
[00:41:35.882 --> 00:41:36.602]  I'm going to move on.
[00:41:36.642 --> 00:41:39.483]  Gerald Solympe wrote the best work he does.
[00:41:39.503 --> 00:41:41.963]  His trends for 2024 and beyond.
[00:41:41.983 --> 00:41:46.645]  He's going to be covering the waterfront with us coming up in the next hour.
[00:41:47.645 --> 00:41:51.726]  After he leaves us, let me tell you what we're going to be getting into.
[00:41:51.746 --> 00:41:54.947]  We're just a few days away before the first vote in Iowa.
[00:41:54.967 --> 00:41:57.848]  We're going to be looking at all of that.
[00:41:59.278 --> 00:42:00.739]  We've got World War III watch, U.S.
[00:42:01.319 --> 00:42:06.963]  allies conduct joint strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, that's Iranian-backed militias.
[00:42:08.083 --> 00:42:12.326]  And again, I don't like Biden bombing these people, and I don't like him doing it without congressional approval.
[00:42:13.467 --> 00:42:19.731]  But Iran is in there, and they've been attacking and shutting down half the traffic going through the Strait of Hormuz.
[00:42:20.431 --> 00:42:21.932]  And so what did they expect to happen?
[00:42:21.972 --> 00:42:22.893]  Well, it's a trap.
[00:42:23.578 --> 00:42:26.560]  We're slowly, but surely, being sucked into World War 3.
[00:42:27.141 --> 00:42:28.341]  World War 3, watch, U.S.
[00:42:28.401 --> 00:42:31.284]  allies conduct joint strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen.
[00:42:32.885 --> 00:42:33.085]  U.S.
[00:42:33.125 --> 00:42:36.988]  and Britain strike Yemen in reprisal for Houthi attacks on shipping.
[00:42:37.528 --> 00:42:38.289]  That's Reuters.
[00:42:39.209 --> 00:42:39.269]  U.S.
[00:42:39.329 --> 00:42:39.830]  and U.K.
[00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:41.071]  strike Houthi militia targets.
[00:42:42.452 --> 00:42:43.252]  What do you call it?
[00:42:43.452 --> 00:42:44.733]  This is up on Infowars.com.
[00:42:45.354 --> 00:42:49.377]  What do you call a war with China, plus a war with Russia, plus a colossal war in the Middle East?
[00:42:50.046 --> 00:42:52.348]  You call it World War 3.
[00:42:53.069 --> 00:43:00.676]  Meanwhile, report US Army sees sharp decline in white recruits because the military now teaches that white people are inherently evil and bad.
[00:43:01.217 --> 00:43:05.441]  That is done as a culling process or a purge.
[00:43:06.582 --> 00:43:13.168]  When you teach transgenderism and you teach radical critical race theory, then white people don't want to join the military.
[00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:17.455]   And then Now they're going to make the military out of illegal aliens.
[00:43:18.075 --> 00:43:26.963]  All the top Democrats from AOC to the Senator from Illinois, I mean, they've all been saying, oh, we'll just have an illegal alien military.
[00:43:27.964 --> 00:43:33.989]  So these purges are done for a reason.
[00:43:36.291 --> 00:43:38.033]  Now I've got a lot of other news I'm going to get to.
[00:43:38.073 --> 00:43:40.375]  The WHO's managerial gambit.
[00:43:41.132 --> 00:43:46.737]  Local officials can enforce biomedical tyranny under the treaty, but no one will be held accountable.
[00:43:47.057 --> 00:43:52.461]  Just like the illegal aliens don't take the poison vaccine because the UN doesn't want to be held accountable.
[00:43:52.721 --> 00:43:53.322]  We'll get into that.
[00:43:55.283 --> 00:43:59.266]  Also, we'll tie into how they don't want citizens to stand up for themselves.
[00:43:59.447 --> 00:44:00.988]  That's the cardinal sin whether you're in Europe.
[00:44:02.566 --> 00:44:11.389]  Whether you are in the United States, clown world, Canadian police warn, posting videos of package thieves could violate their privacy and they're going to arrest you.
[00:44:12.029 --> 00:44:21.492]  And that ties in the Democrats introducing a bill to ban the militia, which is in the Constitution, which state guards are, but you can expand those on the governor or the county commission to the sheriff.
[00:44:22.232 --> 00:44:23.052]  So that's really important.
[00:44:23.072 --> 00:44:28.314]  I've got some really positive success news that I'm going to mention here.
[00:44:29.602 --> 00:44:35.564]  There's a lot more after that, but when I say and, that's not all we're covering, but and, we're about to go to break in a few minutes.
[00:44:36.484 --> 00:44:43.946]  The latest signs that consumers just don't want electric vehicles, and that ties into self-checkout, is a failed experiment.
[00:44:44.386 --> 00:44:47.347]  These aren't experiments, these are social engineering operations.
[00:44:47.967 --> 00:44:58.965]   And if we just reject bugs in the food, and we reject toil to tap, sewage water, and if we reject their poison shots, and if
[00:44:58.965 --> 00:45:05.324]   we reject their self-checkout lanes, and we reject robots taking over our lives, if we simply
[00:45:05.324 --> 00:45:08.583]  reject it all, here's an example.
[00:45:08.583 --> 00:45:15.625]   No one is, basically no one, and the numbers are here, is renting electric cars. You can't find the
[00:45:15.625 --> 00:45:21.545]   charging stations, they take too long. People just know it's garbage.
[00:45:21.815 --> 00:45:22.636]  It's a bridge to nowhere.
[00:45:23.256 --> 00:45:35.984]  And so almost no one's renting them, so not just Hertz, it's just the latest, a bunch of other major rental car companies are getting rid of their electric fleets.
[00:45:36.945 --> 00:45:38.826]  And this can be applied everywhere.
[00:45:38.846 --> 00:45:45.311]  While we still have somewhat of a free market, where you vote with your dollars and with your word of mouth, we can stop.
[00:45:45.631 --> 00:45:48.833]  Look, if your private school is teaching your kid wokeism, get them out.
[00:45:49.841 --> 00:45:53.785]  If there's not enough schools teaching the truth, there'll be a market for it.
[00:45:53.886 --> 00:45:55.547]  It will be created and it's happening.
[00:45:56.929 --> 00:45:58.290]  And it's the same with the public schools.
[00:45:58.988 --> 00:46:01.710]  You know, run for school board, get on there, stop it.
[00:46:02.351 --> 00:46:03.652]  There are so many ways.
[00:46:03.672 --> 00:46:16.562]  That's why the feds, the globalists, are so scared of all these people running for school board and taking over the school boards and stopping the critical race theory and the transgender brainwashing, is because the globalists are directing this locally all over the world, not just here.
[00:46:16.902 --> 00:46:22.166]  They brag about how they're, oh, we can't get our net zero through in the US, we'll just have the cities do it.
[00:46:22.727 --> 00:46:24.328]  Well, people file lawsuits and block it.
[00:46:24.788 --> 00:46:27.731]  You're going to have to fight, folks, for every inch with these people.
[00:46:28.371 --> 00:46:31.833]  And if you don't, the living hell they're going to put us in is staggering.
[00:46:33.814 --> 00:46:35.095]  Absolutely staggering.
[00:46:35.375 --> 00:46:36.416]  And they're launching it all.
[00:46:36.476 --> 00:46:38.957]  So it's going to be easy to recruit people to say no.
[00:46:39.317 --> 00:46:41.599]  It's going to be easy now to wake people up that aren't awake.
[00:46:42.499 --> 00:46:55.307]  Because the central bank digital currencies, the cashless society, the social credit scores, the medical tyranny, the open borders, the open pedophilia, the woke-ism, the carbon taxes, it's all here.
[00:46:56.158 --> 00:47:02.322]  You're not gonna have to have Alex Jones tell you about it and show you a document and tell you how bad it is and how you don't want it.
[00:47:02.663 --> 00:47:04.164]  This isn't 30 years ago.
[00:47:04.964 --> 00:47:05.485]  In April.
[00:47:06.926 --> 00:47:07.526]  Mid-April.
[00:47:09.247 --> 00:47:10.228]  30 years ago I got on air.
[00:47:10.268 --> 00:47:16.833]  We gotta have some type of, not even celebration, but just marking the 30 years because it's been one hell of a fight.
[00:47:17.493 --> 00:47:19.475]  And I'm a testament.
[00:47:19.575 --> 00:47:25.059]  Not leaving my ingenuity or my mind, but God working through me, reaching out and working through you together.
[00:47:26.107 --> 00:47:27.609]  The amazing things we've done.
[00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:30.433]  We're taking intellectual power back.
[00:47:30.813 --> 00:47:32.415]  We're taking the minds back.
[00:47:32.756 --> 00:47:34.558]  We're unleashing minds everywhere.
[00:47:35.279 --> 00:47:36.721]  And it's a beautiful, amazing thing.
[00:47:36.781 --> 00:47:38.183]  And now I'm seeing it used everywhere.
[00:47:38.503 --> 00:47:39.805]  I'm seeing Elon Musk use it.
[00:47:41.507 --> 00:47:44.191]  A month ago, I'm on a two and a half hour interview with him.
[00:47:46.041 --> 00:47:48.923]  I'm talking about the Global Sea Population Plan, the New World Order, he agrees.
[00:47:49.644 --> 00:47:52.386]  He says they're going to collapse civilization and they think they're going to escape it, they won't.
[00:47:52.886 --> 00:47:54.327]  And I said, what do we call it, Elon?
[00:47:54.348 --> 00:47:54.888]  He goes, I don't know.
[00:47:54.908 --> 00:47:57.390]  And I said, let's call it Team Humanity.
[00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:59.351]  He said, yeah, I like that, let's do that.
[00:48:00.212 --> 00:48:01.513]  Wow, think of that position.
[00:48:02.274 --> 00:48:03.294]  30 years ago, AXS TV.
[00:48:03.314 --> 00:48:06.817]  28 years ago, local radio.
[00:48:06.637 --> 00:48:09.637]  eight years ago, local radio.
[00:48:09.637 --> 00:48:11.677]  26 years ago, syndicated.

[00:48:23.646 --> 00:48:24.086]  Together.
[00:48:24.786 --> 00:48:27.408]  And we're just building steam and strength right now.

[00:48:44.712 --> 00:48:47.914]  Two years in the making and we didn't plan it like this because we didn't know.
[00:48:48.743 --> 00:48:51.266]  To release Alex Jones New World Order Wars.
[00:48:51.306 --> 00:48:56.911]  That's all about fighting Epstein and Clinton and Hillary and the Deep State and the pedo-rigs.
[00:48:57.031 --> 00:48:59.654]  Whole levels just dealing with that.
[00:48:59.914 --> 00:49:01.216]  Because that's the truth of how they operate.
[00:49:01.476 --> 00:49:02.937]  And now the game went on Steam.
[00:49:03.198 --> 00:49:05.660]  The biggest online platform of video games in the world.

[00:49:30.015 --> 00:49:31.398]  We are taking back the culture.
[00:49:31.418 --> 00:49:32.460]  We are taking things back.
[00:49:32.761 --> 00:49:35.567]  This will fund the InfoWar, going into the election in the next 10 months.
[00:49:35.988 --> 00:49:37.691]  The only way we fail is if we don't take action.
[00:49:37.771 --> 00:49:40.477]  Get New World Order Wars by Alex Jones now!
[00:49:41.849 --> 00:50:03.917]  The involvement of certain actors, you could say deep state actors within the federal government, to set the stage for what happened in J4, 5, and 6, and to entrap thousands of Americans from across the country, and lure them into this set stage.
[00:50:04.317 --> 00:50:08.699]  The people that were involved in that is quite a large web.
[00:50:11.949 --> 00:50:20.773]  You just said that elements within the federal government, I assume law enforcement, intel, and military, lured Americans to Washington into what you called a trap.
[00:50:21.333 --> 00:50:21.713]  Yes, sir.
[00:50:22.454 --> 00:50:25.395]  And I assume that's a sober conclusion based on the evidence.
[00:50:25.415 --> 00:50:26.675]  That's what you're saying.
[00:50:26.915 --> 00:50:31.217]  That would be my sober assessment as an investigator.
[00:50:31.878 --> 00:50:38.721]  I love my country, and I've always been a staunch defender of the thin blue line.
[00:50:40.327 --> 00:50:43.271]  I would proudly count the FBI amongst that number.
[00:50:43.292 --> 00:50:44.573]  It's like brothers to me.
[00:50:45.134 --> 00:50:56.271]  So to find that level of conspiratorial corruption at the highest levels of the FBI has been very troubling to me as a man, as a cop.
[00:50:57.049 --> 00:51:17.964]  Those Americans were targeted by the FBI, almost universally Republicans and largely Trump supporters, but the FBI worked undercover to infiltrate those conversations and become a significant part of those individual Americans' communications.
[00:51:18.888 --> 00:51:53.036]   When you dig into the evidence that we've had revealed through some criminal cases that I've followed and worked with the families of J6 detainees and Americans that have been persecuted for their involvement in the Capitol that day, some of that evidence is shockingly reveals that the FBI agents that were operating undercover Within the online groups across the country were the first ones to plant the seeds of suggestions of a more radical occupation of the Capitol.
[00:51:53.536 --> 00:52:03.104]  So, FBI had fingerprints on this thing from for many months prior to J45 and 6.
[00:52:04.285 --> 00:52:11.979]   When you say that there were FBI assets in the crowd, in the building beforehand and certainly outside, What's the scale of this?
[00:52:12.039 --> 00:52:14.120]  You talking like 10?
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:14.120]  20?
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:14.660]  No.
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:32.424]   Real hard, objective, and conservative estimates would put the number of FBI assets in the crowd, outside, and Working inside at well over 200.
[00:52:32.664 --> 00:52:32.424]  200?
[00:52:32.764 --> 00:52:33.945]  Yeah.
[00:52:34.545 --> 00:52:35.986]  That is proof of entrapment.
[00:52:36.286 --> 00:52:39.968]  Because, of course, the federal government could have prevented entry into the Capitol building.
[00:52:39.988 --> 00:52:40.808]  There aren't that many doors.
[00:52:41.109 --> 00:52:41.929]  You work there, you know.
[00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:45.551]  But they allowed people in on purpose to entrap them.
[00:52:45.611 --> 00:52:46.752]  That's what that proves, I think.
[00:52:47.032 --> 00:53:05.157]   The FBI assets that were addressed as Trump supporters that were inside the Capitol We're there, I believe, and evidence indicates that they were there to specifically wave in the Trump supporters that had gathered outside the Capitol, and the doors opened and they were allowed in.
[00:53:05.698 --> 00:53:14.324]  On the inside were, oh, there's some more Trump supporters, but really those were FBI assets, law enforcement assets, that knew their way around the Capitol.
[00:53:14.664 --> 00:53:17.627]  They waved those guys in, said, come on, follow us.
[00:53:19.028 --> 00:53:20.169]  You have to have a guide.
[00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:29.158]  And on January 6th, the guides were FBI assets, law enforcement assets, and they were dressed as Trump supporters.
[00:53:29.498 --> 00:53:33.882]  They were positioned inside the Capitol prior to the doors being opened.
[00:53:34.262 --> 00:53:53.799]  So that the Americans that had assembled outside the Capitol, once allowed in, could be brought directly to areas where the FBI and the DOJ and the deep state actors knew would be the most condemning criminal action of Americans being inside the Capitol.
[00:53:54.802 --> 00:53:57.965]  I'm protesting without permit and things.
[00:53:58.025 --> 00:54:02.809]  They knew it was setting the stage for arrest and prosecution.
[00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:07.994]  I'm not trying to create a crime to fit a narrative to blame on the FBI.
[00:54:08.494 --> 00:54:15.441]  I'm following the evidence, and to my horror, it implicates our FBI at the highest level.
[00:54:15.861 --> 00:54:23.244]   A conspiracy within our government at the highest level to set the stage for a compromised
[00:54:23.244 --> 00:54:25.764]  election cycle in 2020.
[00:54:25.764 --> 00:54:34.643]   And then the actions that took place on J45 and 6. And then the criminal investigation,
[00:54:34.643 --> 00:54:40.963]   arrest and prosecution of Americans that they were able to entrap and document.
[00:54:40.963 --> 00:54:47.603]   Well, we do it at the start in the first few weeks of every new year.
[00:54:47.838 --> 00:54:52.088]  Been doing it for, it's gotta be 18, 19 years that I've had a chance to have.
[00:54:53.550 --> 00:54:55.491]  The great Gerald Cilente on with us.
[00:54:55.971 --> 00:54:59.252]  You know, he's the best-selling, number one New York Times best-selling author.
[00:55:00.072 --> 00:55:05.794]  He's been a big government advisor in the previous incarnation, a big lobbyist, so he knows how the inside works.
[00:55:05.814 --> 00:55:10.695]  He's done everything from the Oprah Winfrey Show to Good Morning America to Glenn Beck, Alex Jones, Rush Today, you name it.
[00:55:11.235 --> 00:55:20.538]  And if you want to sign up for his incredible digital magazine that's got some of the best intel anywhere and support this broadcast at the same time, he's a sponsor, go to jonestrends.com.
[00:55:21.198 --> 00:55:22.338]  JonesTrends.com.
[00:55:22.378 --> 00:55:26.320]  And then print off nice color copies of it and hand it out to your friends and family.
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:27.881]  Got the latest trends right here.
[00:55:28.401 --> 00:55:30.322]  The top trends for 2024.
[00:55:30.762 --> 00:55:34.103]  Invaluable information right here in my hand.
[00:55:34.643 --> 00:55:36.304]  TrendsResearch.com is the main site.
[00:55:36.584 --> 00:55:39.925]  On X, formerly Twitter, at Gerald Salente.
[00:55:40.506 --> 00:55:43.447]  Gerald, it is good to have you on, my friend.
[00:55:44.407 --> 00:55:51.774]  And just to be sitting here in this crazy time, how would you, before we get into the trends, define this moment in history we're in right now?
[00:55:51.794 --> 00:55:55.137]  Because you always say, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[00:55:55.517 --> 00:55:57.659]  What do you call Taiwan about to have an election?
[00:55:57.699 --> 00:56:10.590]  China threatening to invade, saber-rattling by both sides, the escalating war in Ukraine, Sweden saying they're bracing for Russian invasion with no evidence, the Middle Eastern war radically expanding between the West and Iran, British and U.S.
[00:56:11.451 --> 00:56:13.692]  First of all, thank you so much for having me.
[00:56:13.711 --> 00:56:18.271]   a whole bunch of targets in Yemen killing Houthi rebels that have been launching attacks
[00:56:18.271 --> 00:56:24.112]   on the Strait of Hormuz and into the Red Sea and other surrounding areas of that ocean there,
[00:56:24.112 --> 00:56:28.351]   the Sea of Arabia. I mean, what a time to be alive, Gerald Cilente.
[00:56:28.351 --> 00:56:36.112]   First of all, thank you so much for having me. I really appreciate it. And I appreciate so much
[00:56:36.112 --> 00:56:42.431]   of what InfoWars does to help so many people give them information that they can't find
[00:56:42.431 --> 00:56:48.911]   anyplace else and how you fight for freedom, peace, and justice and the great staff that you have.
[00:56:49.144 --> 00:56:56.166]  So I'm very honored to be on with you and and of course, through the weekly podcasts.
[00:56:57.946 --> 00:56:59.647]  Alex, I'm at this for 44 years.
[00:57:00.747 --> 00:57:06.328]  As you mentioned, our bestselling books, Friends 2000, international bestselling book.
[00:57:07.168 --> 00:57:09.950]  Trend Tracking, Far Better Than Megatrends, Time Magazine.
[00:57:09.970 --> 00:57:14.572]  I've been publishing the Trends Journal since 1991.
[00:57:14.672 --> 00:57:16.533]  It's a weekly.
[00:57:17.434 --> 00:57:18.194]  I'm heartbroken.
[00:57:19.315 --> 00:57:21.056]  I'm heartbroken and seeing the future.
[00:57:22.157 --> 00:57:23.918]  World War III has already begun.
[00:57:23.938 --> 00:57:26.960]  It began with the Ukraine War.
[00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:35.658]   And again, people have no idea about why it began, what happened, and what Set it off.
[00:57:35.938 --> 00:57:40.321]  All they hear is from the mainstream media crap that they keep selling.
[00:57:40.361 --> 00:57:45.725]  The prostitutes, the media whores, they get paid to put out by their corporate pimps and government whoremasters.
[00:57:46.446 --> 00:57:57.435]  And a contributor to Occupy Peace sent a very generous donation and she said that your title of calling them prostitutes is incorrect.
[00:57:58.375 --> 00:58:03.775]   She said because prostitutes, prostitutes, At least you get what you paid for.
[00:58:04.216 --> 00:58:05.657]  Exactly.
[00:58:06.898 --> 00:58:10.461]  So here's the cover of our magazine back in 2014.
[00:58:10.521 --> 00:58:12.903]  The guy's not happy.
[00:58:13.363 --> 00:58:18.708]  It's the United States' overthrow of the democratically elected government of Viktor Yanukovych in Ukraine.
[00:58:19.368 --> 00:58:21.790]  Washington is driving the world to the final war.
[00:58:22.731 --> 00:58:25.613]  Here it is by Dr. Paul Kremgorvets.
[00:58:25.673 --> 00:58:31.458]  So now, World War III began with the Ukraine war.
[00:58:32.592 --> 00:58:34.954]  Now it's been ramped up with the Israel war.
[00:58:35.654 --> 00:58:47.522]  And as you mentioned, the United States and the UK, I think you need an F and a C in the UK, they're the ones that just bombs away over Yemen.
[00:58:48.743 --> 00:59:00.050]  Once upon a time, Alex, there used to be a thing called the Constitution that gave Congress the only right to declare war.
[00:59:01.578 --> 00:59:03.259]  Hey, I'm the Commander-in-Chief.
[00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:05.181]  I'll do anything I want.
[00:59:06.241 --> 00:59:09.524]  All you are is plantation workers of slave land.
[00:59:09.564 --> 00:59:10.624]  Do you do what we tell you?
[00:59:11.785 --> 00:59:14.007]  This is unparalleled what's going on there.
[00:59:15.348 --> 00:59:17.549]  This is now going back.
[00:59:17.669 --> 00:59:21.832]  World War III is going to happen and they're already warning it.
[00:59:22.172 --> 00:59:25.895]  They're already warning about Hezbollah may attack America.
[00:59:26.375 --> 00:59:27.776]  Oh yeah, like 9-11, huh?
[00:59:28.416 --> 00:59:30.798]  As you said, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[00:59:31.451 --> 00:59:34.292]  What followed the Great Depression?
[00:59:35.112 --> 00:59:35.893]  World War II.
[00:59:36.393 --> 00:59:37.934]  What followed the dot-com bust?
[00:59:38.434 --> 00:59:39.374]  The War on Terror.
[00:59:40.795 --> 00:59:43.896]  You, again, one of our top trends, of course, is World War III.
[00:59:43.936 --> 00:59:49.198]  Another one, again, all things are connected, like the blood which unites us all, said Chief Seattle.
[00:59:50.038 --> 00:59:54.320]  One of our top trends is migrant madness, and I'm mad as hell.
[00:59:55.601 --> 00:59:56.441]  Why are they leaving?
[00:59:56.701 --> 00:59:58.922]  Why are they escaping all these countries?
[00:59:59.941 --> 01:00:01.923]  Because their economies are in the toilet.
[01:00:02.483 --> 01:00:03.784]  Thanks to the COVID war.
[01:00:03.884 --> 01:00:05.485]  It was already bad before that.
[01:00:06.646 --> 01:00:08.548]  But the COVID war made it a lot worse.
[01:00:09.569 --> 01:00:13.472]  So now you have this migrant crisis going on.
[01:00:14.793 --> 01:00:16.134]  You have people fleeing.
[01:00:16.832 --> 01:00:27.698]  Because of declining economies, they're escaping lack of basic living standards, government corruption, crime and violence.
[01:00:28.339 --> 01:00:31.841]  I'm saying this because the global economy is going down.
[01:00:32.181 --> 01:00:33.182]  Oh, you don't believe us?
[01:00:33.702 --> 01:00:41.347]  Oh, the World Bank came out on Tuesday and said, Europe's going to have its worst year in 30 years.
[01:00:42.387 --> 01:00:45.309]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[01:00:46.644 --> 01:00:48.046]  This war's ramping up.
[01:00:48.326 --> 01:00:53.291]  The only way that Biden's going to stay in office is with war going on.
[01:00:53.732 --> 01:00:57.256]  If they attack America, we have to do what we can to fight back.
[01:00:57.956 --> 01:00:58.917]  Let's go back.
[01:00:59.118 --> 01:01:01.340]  Again, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:04.684]  How about the dot-com bust?
[01:01:04.764 --> 01:01:05.885]  Oh, that's ancient history.
[01:01:06.225 --> 01:01:06.706]  No, no, no.
[01:01:06.766 --> 01:01:09.175]   It happened in Happened in 2000.
[01:01:10.216 --> 01:01:14.480]  And Gerald, let me stop you for just a moment because there's a lot of new viewers here on the show.
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:19.624]  We're live right now on Friday at 12, 12 central time.
[01:01:20.144 --> 01:01:26.850]  But I'm going to take a clip of this and I'm going to put it up on X and I would imagine it'll probably get a million views, maybe more, but I would guess about a million.
[01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:31.314]  People are smart, but they're not a trends forecaster.
[01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:32.735]  They have been doing this for decades like we have.
[01:01:33.908 --> 01:01:36.069]  The global establishment follows patterns.
[01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:37.470]  The Rand Corporation writes about it.
[01:01:37.931 --> 01:01:38.591]  They talk about it.
[01:01:38.631 --> 01:01:40.552]  The Pentagon saying prepare for full war.
[01:01:41.193 --> 01:01:42.894]  Sweden saying prepare for nuclear war.
[01:01:43.234 --> 01:01:45.296]  With no evidence Russia's going to invade.
[01:01:45.396 --> 01:01:50.619]  When they come to an end of their financial system or there's a crisis, they prop it up with a war.
[01:01:50.959 --> 01:01:53.461]  And it didn't just start with the US government or other governments.
[01:01:53.761 --> 01:01:55.943]  This has been going on for thousands of years.
[01:01:56.323 --> 01:01:57.164]  It's a well-known pattern.
[01:01:57.184 --> 01:02:02.347]  So maybe you should give people just some historical understanding of how this isn't a trend.
[01:02:02.547 --> 01:02:03.668]  I would call it a rule.
[01:02:05.989 --> 01:02:11.172]  Let's go back to World War Two.
[01:02:12.633 --> 01:02:13.853]  Anybody could Google it up.
[01:02:15.254 --> 01:02:22.078]  Franklin Roosevelt seizes Japanese assets.
[01:02:23.899 --> 01:02:25.099]  Up comes history today.
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:34.994]   In July of 1941, President Roosevelt seized all Japanese assets in America.
[01:02:35.455 --> 01:02:36.435]  And you know why, Alex?
[01:02:37.837 --> 01:02:42.380]  Those dirty Japanese, they invaded French Indochina.
[01:02:43.901 --> 01:02:44.962]  French Indochina?
[01:02:45.303 --> 01:02:45.783]  Vietnam.
[01:02:47.424 --> 01:02:49.166]  Cambodia and Laos.
[01:02:49.666 --> 01:02:51.888]  And what the hell are the French doing over there?
[01:02:52.528 --> 01:02:55.611]  Who made up this name, French Indochina?
[01:02:56.514 --> 01:02:58.255]  Oh, you mean you're stealing their tin?
[01:02:58.595 --> 01:03:00.056]  You're stealing their rubber?
[01:03:00.537 --> 01:03:01.397]  Rape pillage?
[01:03:01.957 --> 01:03:04.319]  How dare those Japanese go in there?
[01:03:04.939 --> 01:03:06.880]  And you know what else those dirty Japanese did?
[01:03:07.421 --> 01:03:09.342]  They took up... This is, again, history today.
[01:03:09.422 --> 01:03:10.402]  Anybody could Google it up.
[01:03:11.023 --> 01:03:11.423]  Right there.
[01:03:11.443 --> 01:03:21.309]  They took over Cameron Air Force Base, which was only 800 miles from the United States military bases in the Philippines.
[01:03:21.989 --> 01:03:22.550]  Hey, wait a minute.
[01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:24.291]  What the hell are we doing in the Philippines?
[01:03:25.290 --> 01:03:26.210]  We have no right being there.
[01:03:27.071 --> 01:03:28.051]  Oh, you know what else they did?
[01:03:28.071 --> 01:03:34.413]  They were also very close to the British troops in Singapore.
[01:03:35.834 --> 01:03:38.074]  What the hell are the British troops doing in Singapore?
[01:03:38.114 --> 01:03:38.254]  Why?
[01:03:38.294 --> 01:03:40.035]  The sun never sets on the British Empire.
[01:03:40.335 --> 01:03:42.596]  Wait a minute, you seized all Japanese assets for that?
[01:03:42.936 --> 01:03:43.416]  That's right.
[01:03:43.796 --> 01:03:56.370]   And again, then what happens is the British and the Dutch and the United States put sanctions on Japan and cut off three quarters Of their global trade.
[01:03:59.031 --> 01:03:59.351]  All right.
[01:04:00.251 --> 01:04:05.432]  Then they cut off 88% of their imported oil.
[01:04:05.453 --> 01:04:08.793]  Man, they only import 100%.
[01:04:10.854 --> 01:04:12.074]  So they don't have any oil.
[01:04:12.794 --> 01:04:13.935]  They don't have any trade.
[01:04:15.215 --> 01:04:17.255]  Can't understand why they bomb Pearl Harbor.
[01:04:17.976 --> 01:04:18.816]  Blow me away.
[01:04:18.836 --> 01:04:23.557]  And again, go back to the dot-com bust.
[01:04:24.634 --> 01:04:27.335]  Little Georgie Bush's ratings were in the toilet.
[01:04:27.955 --> 01:04:30.016]  The United States was in a recession.
[01:04:31.117 --> 01:04:39.040]  And again, we forecasted the dot-com bust in our Trends Journal in, where is it?
[01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:44.102]  I had it over here a second ago, in dot-com this.
[01:04:45.205 --> 01:04:47.167]  Was the name of it, now somewhere.
[01:04:47.447 --> 01:04:49.208]  We know you predicted it all.
[01:04:49.228 --> 01:04:52.611]  The point is, it's not even a forecast.
[01:04:52.671 --> 01:04:53.792]  It's a rule.
[01:04:54.032 --> 01:04:54.832]  They always do it.
[01:04:54.912 --> 01:04:56.694]  So they're clearly going to do it again.
[01:04:56.714 --> 01:04:59.596]  Describe how you see this expanding and unfolding.
[01:05:00.537 --> 01:05:02.078]  You're gonna see a false flag event.
[01:05:04.133 --> 01:05:07.876]  You commented what is in the media now and that's what I'm saying.
[01:05:07.936 --> 01:05:16.023]  Everybody should go to InfoWars every day and you see the articles they're putting up and what they're putting up because I, you know, we go around the world.
[01:05:16.664 --> 01:05:32.535]  So if we're talking about what's going on in the Israel war, we go to Times of Israel, we go to Haaretz, the Israeli newspaper, Jerusalem Post, and then we go to the Iranian ones, ISNA, IRNA, Tehran News, Al Jazeera, we go there.
[01:05:32.995 --> 01:05:37.859]  So go to this because you just mentioned what's going on.
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:43.823]  And the reality is war is going on.
[01:05:44.543 --> 01:05:45.324]  They've attacked.
[01:05:45.905 --> 01:05:53.949]  You mentioned what Sweden is saying, or Norway, I forgot which one you said, that watch out for war with Russia.
[01:05:53.989 --> 01:06:02.432]  They're both saying it, but the Sweden defense minister said basically get ready for war, causing a panic, and Russia says we have no intent of going into Sweden.
[01:06:03.553 --> 01:06:03.733]  Yep.
[01:06:05.754 --> 01:06:16.892]   And again, People have no idea, talking about the Ukraine war, the deal made between, when they broke up the Soviet Union with Gorbachev and Bush Sr.
[01:06:17.592 --> 01:06:21.615]  and James Baker, quote, NATO will not move one inch further.
[01:06:22.616 --> 01:06:24.877]  There were 16 NATO countries back then.
[01:06:25.709 --> 01:06:25.969]  Now?
[01:06:27.010 --> 01:06:25.969]  31?
[01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:40.575]  So if the Russians were up in Canada with missiles aimed at the United States and the Chinese were down in Mexico with missiles aimed at the United States, oh, everybody would be so happy.
[01:06:42.236 --> 01:06:48.998]  And they don't talk about all of the flights, all of what the NATO and the United States are doing off the coast of Russia.
[01:06:49.219 --> 01:06:58.007]   Could you imagine if the Japanese, the Chinese were down in the Gulf of Mexico And the Russians were off the coast of New York.
[01:06:59.128 --> 01:07:11.490]  So they're aggravating this, again, not my words, the words of a five-star general, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, and two-term president, Dwight D. Eisenhower.
[01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:21.552]  The military-industrial complex is robbing the nation of the genius of the scientists, the sweat of the laborers, and the future of the children.
[01:07:22.188 --> 01:07:23.309]  Here we are.
[01:07:23.709 --> 01:07:28.232]  The military-industrial complex is in full control of America.
[01:07:28.732 --> 01:07:29.933]  Right in front of your eyes.
[01:07:32.975 --> 01:07:34.696]  So the dominoes are now falling.
[01:07:36.197 --> 01:07:38.299]  How do you see this unfolding?
[01:07:38.319 --> 01:07:38.859]  Because I agree with you.
[01:07:38.879 --> 01:07:40.080]  World War III has already begun.
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:41.541]  Most analysts agree with that.
[01:07:41.561 --> 01:07:43.382]  Only question is, does it go nuclear?
[01:07:43.422 --> 01:07:44.303]  Walk through that.
[01:07:44.463 --> 01:07:44.723]  Yeah.
[01:07:45.123 --> 01:07:46.044]  It's gonna go nuclear.
[01:07:46.064 --> 01:07:47.165]  They're maniacs!
[01:07:48.345 --> 01:07:50.567]  You don't ask a murderer why they're a murderer.
[01:07:51.385 --> 01:07:52.446]  They're maniacs!
[01:07:52.686 --> 01:07:55.228]  World War II is in ancient history.
[01:07:55.688 --> 01:07:58.570]  How many, how many million people were slaughtered?
[01:07:59.471 --> 01:08:09.638]  They asked Albert Einstein, a cat that knew a thing or two about the atomic bomb, they asked him what kind of weapons will be used to fight the Third World War.
[01:08:09.658 --> 01:08:10.899]  He said, I don't know.
[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:14.342]  He said, but they'll be using sticks and stones to fight the fourth.
[01:08:15.655 --> 01:08:30.888]  Again, when I came out with that book, Trends 2000, I was brought down to Virginia military institute, VMI, to talk about World War III and the weaponry that would be used.
[01:08:32.529 --> 01:08:35.031]  It's a whole different world, a whole different world.
[01:08:36.392 --> 01:08:42.878]  And again, they're going to do something like the Russians hacked our banking system.
[01:08:44.355 --> 01:08:46.976]  You lost all your money, but don't worry about it.
[01:08:47.396 --> 01:08:49.097]  We come out with a digital currency.
[01:08:49.137 --> 01:08:50.317]  Everything's okay.
[01:08:51.538 --> 01:08:59.161]  And now everybody's, you know, again, one of our top trends, the synthetic devolution.
[01:09:00.722 --> 01:09:04.003]  Everybody's AI digitized to death.
[01:09:04.463 --> 01:09:05.684]  They'll accept it like that.
[01:09:06.224 --> 01:09:07.364]  They'll accept it like that.
[01:09:08.005 --> 01:09:13.327]  They're going to use this war for anything that they can do to rob us more of our life.
[01:09:14.022 --> 01:09:15.723]  Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:09:16.023 --> 01:09:17.564]  Happiness is a dirty word.
[01:09:17.945 --> 01:09:19.005]  Never hear about it.
[01:09:19.266 --> 01:09:20.967]  Always a declaration of independence.
[01:09:21.167 --> 01:09:22.628]  You got no independence.
[01:09:24.089 --> 01:09:26.671]  And again, George Washington's farewell address.
[01:09:26.871 --> 01:09:28.972]  He uses the word happiness so many times in it.
[01:09:29.513 --> 01:09:31.074]  You never hear the word anymore at all.
[01:09:31.354 --> 01:09:39.379]  They're going to use this war to keep stealing more of our rights and they're going to annihilate us if we the people don't stand up and stop it.
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:40.320]  Hey, Alex.
[01:09:41.095 --> 01:09:42.556]  Where are all these religions?
[01:09:42.896 --> 01:09:44.257]  What happened to the Quakers?
[01:09:44.297 --> 01:09:45.478]  They all died in an earthquake?
[01:09:46.079 --> 01:09:48.500]  Seventh-day Adventists waiting for the eighth day?
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:51.783]  Where are the Catholics, the Episcopalians, the Baptists?
[01:09:52.103 --> 01:09:55.786]  Where are all the religious leaders calling for peace?
[01:09:56.506 --> 01:09:59.427]  Oh, how about on the back of all America's currency?
[01:09:59.907 --> 01:10:01.468]  In God we trust.
[01:10:01.848 --> 01:10:03.248]  What God you talking about?
[01:10:03.268 --> 01:10:04.548]  Well, I'll tell you what's happening, Gerald.
[01:10:04.568 --> 01:10:06.569]  You said it, and the studies are there.
[01:10:06.629 --> 01:10:08.530]  People digitally think that's the real world.
[01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:09.710]  They watch so much entertainment.
[01:10:10.370 --> 01:10:16.412]  War in Ukraine, war in the Middle East, war with China, even though it's all being set up and already rolling forward, the dominoes are falling.
[01:10:17.453 --> 01:10:21.477]  It's like some hypothetical thing, like it's a football game or entertainment.
[01:10:21.517 --> 01:10:23.278]  People don't know how little the world is.
[01:10:23.659 --> 01:10:30.486]  They don't know there are Russian submarines in the Atlantic that can vaporize all our eastern cities in five minutes, and the Pacific.
[01:10:30.506 --> 01:10:32.147]  They don't know we've got submarines there to do that.
[01:10:32.468 --> 01:10:34.229]  They don't know what mutually assured destruction is.
[01:10:34.249 --> 01:10:35.030]  Don't forget the quote.
[01:10:35.271 --> 01:10:36.312]  In fact, pull it up.
[01:10:36.332 --> 01:10:38.153]  People don't believe this because he said it a year ago.
[01:10:38.173 --> 01:10:39.295]  Remember Sean Penn?
[01:10:40.393 --> 01:10:42.434]  Said, why are we saying nukes are off the table?
[01:10:42.474 --> 01:10:44.275]  We can have a survivable nuclear war.
[01:10:44.395 --> 01:10:45.536]  What does he know about that?
[01:10:45.636 --> 01:10:49.899]  All the real studies say, once a little bit of it starts, tactical nukes.
[01:10:50.219 --> 01:10:52.900]  Tell them in the studies, Gerald, because you advise the military on this.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:53.501]  What happens?
[01:10:53.521 --> 01:10:54.741]  What's the RAND Corporation say?
[01:10:55.202 --> 01:11:01.125]  Once you start using even tacticals, within days, if not hours, you're in full commitment, total nuclear war.
[01:11:01.425 --> 01:11:02.146]  Explain that to them.
[01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:07.712]  Yeah, again, Sean Penn, Sean Pencil is a little clown boy of nothing.
[01:11:07.732 --> 01:11:12.034]  He goes to Ukraine, tells people they gotta get the COVID jab.
[01:11:12.054 --> 01:11:14.174]  I mean, why don't they quote Mickey Mouse?
[01:11:14.435 --> 01:11:16.415]  Hey, how about what's Taylor Swift doing today?
[01:11:17.196 --> 01:11:19.457]  So let's go back to the nuclear annihilation.
[01:11:20.677 --> 01:11:25.079]  How about a guy by the name of John F. Kennedy?
[01:11:25.499 --> 01:11:26.459]  Everybody could look it up.
[01:11:29.008 --> 01:11:39.351]  Commencement speech to the graduating students at American University in June of 1963.
[01:11:39.871 --> 01:11:40.491]  June, right?
[01:11:40.871 --> 01:11:44.513]  July, August, September, October, November, Jack, you're dead.
[01:11:45.753 --> 01:11:48.834]  The whole speech was about peace.
[01:11:50.294 --> 01:12:05.320]   Now, little Sean Pencil there, who's got a pecker like a pencil, or a head like one, Kennedy goes on to say, first of all, he says we should not hate the Russian people, the Soviet Union, the Russian people.
[01:12:06.361 --> 01:12:11.004]  They suffered more than anybody in World War II.
[01:12:11.964 --> 01:12:28.074]  He goes on to say that over 20 million of them lost their lives and their farms, their homes, their land, their factories were destroyed from the equivalent of Chicago to the East Coast.
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:50.649]  Pencilhead, Kennedy also goes on to say that if we have an atomic bomb war with the Soviet Union, life on Earth will be destroyed in 24 hours.
[01:12:52.309 --> 01:12:54.170]  That's how many years ago, 60 years ago.
[01:12:54.410 --> 01:12:56.831]  And now the weapons are way more powerful.
[01:12:57.692 --> 01:12:58.512]  Way more powerful.
[01:13:01.584 --> 01:13:02.144]  So there it is.
[01:13:03.065 --> 01:13:05.205]  Again, we have maniacs in control.
[01:13:05.666 --> 01:13:08.507]  Look at this freak show.
[01:13:08.547 --> 01:13:15.269]  Take the Russian ICBM Satan missile that's hypersonic, Mach 10, can't shoot it down.
[01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:18.891]  It comes back out of orbit, you launch it, it goes up, it's ballistic.
[01:13:19.951 --> 01:13:22.152]  They shoot it over the North Pole, it comes over the US.
[01:13:22.852 --> 01:13:29.495]  Dozens of warheads are launched, each one a hundred times bigger than what we dropped on Hiroshima.
[01:13:31.476 --> 01:13:31.596]  Yeah.
[01:13:32.837 --> 01:13:34.978]  And again, we have maniacs in charge.
[01:13:35.678 --> 01:13:37.159]  Look at that little Katsan Macron.
[01:13:37.179 --> 01:13:38.579]  Look at the little freak show over there.
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:41.561]  Look at that sundack over there in the UK.
[01:13:42.001 --> 01:13:48.024]  Before him, a little clown that you couldn't, that the best cartoonist couldn't come up with a better one than Boris Johnson.
[01:13:48.764 --> 01:13:51.265]  Look at the little freak show he got in the United States.
[01:13:52.066 --> 01:14:06.793]   You got a dead in front of your eyes Mitch McConnell, out of his mind Biden, little Lindsey Graham, Adam Schipp, one little clown, little Chuckie Shuma, look at the idiots and morons running the show!
[01:14:08.703 --> 01:14:10.364]  They're going to destroy us.
[01:14:10.444 --> 01:14:12.264]  That's our greatest concern.
[01:14:12.545 --> 01:14:17.066]  And the problem is, this is like academic to people because there's a normalcy bias.
[01:14:17.767 --> 01:14:21.388]  We've had mutually assured destruction, you know, since the 60s.
[01:14:21.768 --> 01:14:25.910]  We've had the age of atomic weapons since 45 and the Manhattan Project.
[01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:30.712]  And just because something hasn't happened doesn't mean there's not a probability it will.
[01:14:31.032 --> 01:14:35.614]  And you know, the International Group of Atomic Scientists, they've never brought the doomsday clock closer to midnight.
[01:14:36.638 --> 01:14:36.798]  Nope.
[01:14:37.238 --> 01:14:39.059]  And let's go back to the Israel war.
[01:14:39.499 --> 01:14:42.860]  Does anybody know about the Samson option?
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:44.761]  Tell people about the Samson option.
[01:14:44.781 --> 01:14:51.543]  If Israel starts losing for all the Muslim states that want to drive them into the sea from the mountains of the sea, what does Israel do when that happens?
[01:14:51.563 --> 01:14:52.383]  They nuke everybody.
[01:14:53.083 --> 01:14:53.963]  They nuke everybody.
[01:14:53.983 --> 01:14:58.345]  Again, they're maniacs in charge.
[01:14:58.365 --> 01:14:59.385]  Tell them about the Samson option.
[01:15:00.486 --> 01:15:02.246]  The Samson option is exactly what you said.
[01:15:02.406 --> 01:15:03.366]  They're going to go nuke.
[01:15:03.747 --> 01:15:04.467]  We're not going to lose.
[01:15:04.507 --> 01:15:05.107]  We're going nuke.
[01:15:06.391 --> 01:15:07.691]  Again, you've got maniacs in charge.
[01:15:07.712 --> 01:15:09.032]  Look what's going on over there.
[01:15:09.612 --> 01:15:11.613]  I mean, I'm totally opposed to it.
[01:15:11.633 --> 01:15:13.113]  You know, I launched Occupy Peace.
[01:15:13.574 --> 01:15:15.734]  So it has nothing to do with Israel or anybody.
[01:15:15.754 --> 01:15:18.015]  I'm not anti-American because I hate America's wars.
[01:15:18.835 --> 01:15:20.536]  It's disgusting what's going on over there.
[01:15:20.576 --> 01:15:23.917]  Well, you've got over 80% of the Jews don't like Netanyahu.
[01:15:24.457 --> 01:15:24.938]  Exactly.
[01:15:26.038 --> 01:15:27.899]  Again, let's look at the facts.
[01:15:28.419 --> 01:15:29.879]  I'm not a great numbers guy.
[01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:32.820]  How many Jewish people are there in the world?
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:34.041]  16 million?
[01:15:35.484 --> 01:15:36.064]  Out of how many?
[01:15:36.084 --> 01:15:37.605]  Eight billion?
[01:15:39.465 --> 01:15:41.506]  How many Muslims are there in the world?
[01:15:41.526 --> 01:15:42.387]  Billion and a half.
[01:15:42.407 --> 01:15:43.087]  About two billion?
[01:15:43.267 --> 01:15:44.167]  Yeah, close to a billion now.
[01:15:44.447 --> 01:15:49.749]  Against, yeah, against 16, 15, 16 million?
[01:15:50.850 --> 01:15:52.070]  You're gonna lose.
[01:15:52.610 --> 01:15:53.251]  You're gonna lose.
[01:15:53.951 --> 01:15:54.771]  You better have peace.
[01:15:55.411 --> 01:15:56.312]  Look, I'm a fighter.
[01:15:57.052 --> 01:15:59.453]  If five guys come in here, man, hey, take it easy.
[01:15:59.473 --> 01:15:59.953]  What can I do?
[01:16:00.053 --> 01:16:01.033]  How can we settle this?
[01:16:01.734 --> 01:16:02.474]  I'm not gonna fight.
[01:16:04.033 --> 01:16:05.834]  And I'm telling you, we need peace now.
[01:16:06.154 --> 01:16:07.615]  We got maniacs in charge.
[01:16:07.695 --> 01:16:11.377]  Oh, go, Alex, go back to our top trends of 2023.
[01:16:12.337 --> 01:16:14.238]  Middle East meltdown.
[01:16:14.779 --> 01:16:23.703]  We warned this would happen when Netanyahu became prime minister again, but for the sixth time in the end of December 2022.
[01:16:23.863 --> 01:16:32.388]  And not my language with the mainstream media and his right wing extreme government.
[01:16:34.904 --> 01:16:38.507]  This thing was building up, people forgot about the 39 weeks of protest.
[01:16:39.408 --> 01:16:41.910]  Hundreds of thousands taking to the streets in Israel.
[01:16:42.271 --> 01:16:47.775]  Hundreds of thousands, 39 weeks in a row against Netanyahu's judicial reform act.
[01:16:47.976 --> 01:16:53.701]  And then, we gotta go to break, Gerald, but how convenient that there was a stand down magically when all this happened.
[01:16:54.421 --> 01:16:54.862]  You got it.
[01:16:55.874 --> 01:16:56.935]  And they were warned about it.
[01:16:57.395 --> 01:16:58.316]  They were warned about it.
[01:16:58.616 --> 01:17:06.042]  Two days after, we put the data, again, we only put the data in, the United States and Egypt had warned Israel of a Hamas attack.
[01:17:06.062 --> 01:17:07.043]  Stay right there, though.
[01:17:07.143 --> 01:17:15.009]  I want to finish up with the dominoes falling, how we stopped World War III, then we'll get into the economy, the border, Trump, all your big trends, Gerald Solente straight ahead.
[01:17:15.029 --> 01:17:16.150]  Talk about it, you know, tune in now.
[01:17:16.490 --> 01:17:18.552]  This is key information, InfoWars.com.
[01:17:19.092 --> 01:17:22.055]  Again, tomorrow's news today, Jonestrends.com, Jonestrends.com.
[01:17:22.615 --> 01:17:24.656]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's happening.
[01:17:25.136 --> 01:17:37.321]  Two years in the making, and we didn't plan it like this because we didn't know, to release Alex Jones New World Order Wars that's all about fighting Epstein, and Clinton, and Hillary, and the Deep State, and the pedo rings.
[01:17:37.441 --> 01:17:41.622]  Whole levels just dealing with that because that's the truth about how they operate.
[01:17:41.902 --> 01:17:46.064]  And now the game went on Steam, the biggest online platform of video games in the world.
[01:17:46.084 --> 01:17:46.864]  150 million users a week.
[01:17:49.185 --> 01:17:51.087]  And it already shot to number one.
[01:17:51.367 --> 01:18:00.035]  So find the link to Steam at AlexJonesGame.com or search Alex Jones New World Order Wars at Steam and get it for yourself.
[01:18:00.216 --> 01:18:04.680]  It's got an incredible 97% reviews.
[01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:08.984]  We'll put the link to Steam on screen and to AlexJonesGame.com.
[01:18:09.364 --> 01:18:10.085]  Get it now!
[01:18:10.445 --> 01:18:11.806]  We are taking back the culture.
[01:18:11.846 --> 01:18:12.887]  We are taking things back.
[01:18:13.187 --> 01:18:15.968]  This will fund the InfoWar, going into the election in the next 10 months.
[01:18:16.389 --> 01:18:18.110]  The only way we fail is if we don't take action.
[01:18:17.970 --> 01:18:20.970]  and get New World Order Wars by Alex Jones now.
[01:18:21.970 --> 01:18:24.970]  During the break, working on another Elon Musk interview.
[01:18:24.970 --> 01:18:25.970]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:28.970]  A lot of stuff going on. A lot of people are on Team Humanity.
[01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:32.970]   A lot of people don't want nuclear war. A lot of people want prosperity.
[01:18:32.970 --> 01:18:36.970]   And we can have it easily, ladies and gentlemen, if we become societally, culturally, economically,
[01:18:36.970 --> 01:18:41.970]  spiritually literate.
[01:18:42.474 --> 01:18:47.658]  All right, Joe Salente, I hate to say let's segue out of World War III, because that's the big enchilada on the table.
[01:18:48.278 --> 01:18:50.060]  But we got all these other factors leading to it.
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.221]  But globalists are in trouble.
[01:18:51.641 --> 01:18:53.002]  Their old financial system is coming down.
[01:18:53.042 --> 01:18:54.403]  Their Ponzi scheme is collapsing.
[01:18:54.743 --> 01:18:58.546]  They want to bring in the global central bank digital currencies and the ESGs.
[01:18:58.586 --> 01:19:04.071]  They admit that the RAND Corporation, I covered it yesterday, they're going to use global crises to stay in power.
[01:19:05.239 --> 01:19:06.119]  I mean, stay in power.
[01:19:06.139 --> 01:19:10.040]  I mean, they dictate to the world, they're already so rich, it's insane.
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:12.261]  So, what are the dominoes falling?
[01:19:12.281 --> 01:19:13.301]  We already kind of got into that.
[01:19:13.661 --> 01:19:15.021]  And then how do we stop this?
[01:19:15.061 --> 01:19:18.162]  How do we pull all of our collective asses out of the fire?
[01:19:19.883 --> 01:19:21.883]  You know, you talked about having musk on.
[01:19:24.264 --> 01:19:33.386]  How about if the billionaires donated a billion dollars, which is chump change, for peace?
[01:19:34.594 --> 01:19:37.136]  What if the billionaires said, no, we had enough of this.
[01:19:37.997 --> 01:19:38.757]  We want peace.
[01:19:38.777 --> 01:19:40.499]  I'm going to donate money.
[01:19:41.212 --> 01:19:43.873]  To the peace organizations to make sure this happens.
[01:19:44.333 --> 01:20:05.301]  And instead of having all these kangaroo UN events that are frauds put on international summits, instead of the Davos group, what if, what if a couple times a year at first and once a month, what if Musk led like an anti-Davos group, an alternative plan with all the experts and all these diverse groups up there to create an alternative idea in the public?
[01:20:05.321 --> 01:20:08.602]  You know, Musk has talked about an alternative plan for humanity that isn't globalist.
[01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:10.830]  Let's go.
[01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:13.112]  Let's just stay with the United States for a moment.
[01:20:14.012 --> 01:20:14.493]  You saw it.
[01:20:15.213 --> 01:20:16.594]  Again, all things are connected.
[01:20:17.334 --> 01:20:20.556]  You look what happened with Russia when the Ukraine war happened.
[01:20:21.257 --> 01:20:23.358]  Biden put sanctions on Russia.
[01:20:23.758 --> 01:20:25.079]  He said Putin will pay for this.
[01:20:25.159 --> 01:20:29.382]  No, the people paid for it with inflation skyrocketing, especially in Europe.
[01:20:30.503 --> 01:20:32.044]  Look at Russia's economy now.
[01:20:32.884 --> 01:20:33.585]  They're doing great.
[01:20:34.305 --> 01:20:35.566]  They're becoming self-sustaining.
[01:20:36.346 --> 01:20:40.178]   They have the human and natural resources To make that happen.
[01:20:40.198 --> 01:20:45.181]  Remember when all those stupid businesses left Russia one after another?
[01:20:45.561 --> 01:20:46.701]  Oh, the Russians opened them up.
[01:20:47.162 --> 01:20:49.943]  Or McDonald's left, they opened up a McRussian or whatever.
[01:20:51.023 --> 01:20:54.565]  Self-sustaining economy goes back to the United States.
[01:20:55.285 --> 01:20:59.887]  We have all the human and natural resources we need to be self-sustaining.
[01:21:00.548 --> 01:21:13.986]   But these slimy little scumbags called politicians did away with all of the First, they did away with the antitrust laws, and then they did away with all of these import taxes.
[01:21:14.907 --> 01:21:25.473]  So now, you got again that murderous SOB, Bill Clinton, every time he got caught with his pants down, bombs away over Baghdad, he brings China into the World Trade Organization.
[01:21:26.494 --> 01:21:34.258]  You look at China's GDP before they got into the World Trade Organization, which they officially got in two weeks after 9-11, so nobody knew it.
[01:21:34.718 --> 01:21:36.039]  Their GDP from 1970 was like this.
[01:21:38.963 --> 01:21:40.983]  2001, whoop, way up.
[01:21:41.524 --> 01:21:44.644]  Because the manufacturers said, screw you Americans.
[01:21:45.525 --> 01:21:49.325]  We're sending our, getting our manufacturing done over there.
[01:21:49.565 --> 01:21:50.726]  We got slave labor.
[01:21:50.786 --> 01:21:51.546]  Oh, I forgot.
[01:21:52.046 --> 01:21:53.526]  It was the same Bill Clinton.
[01:21:53.566 --> 01:21:55.187]  A little boy of nothing.
[01:21:55.767 --> 01:21:57.227]  A little boy of nothing.
[01:21:57.907 --> 01:21:59.488]  And that little Al Gore.
[01:21:59.748 --> 01:22:01.148]  How about Al Hoare?
[01:22:01.848 --> 01:22:03.108]  Who gave us NAFTA.
[01:22:04.229 --> 01:22:09.318]   I remember when there were Factories all over where I am and up in northern New York.
[01:22:10.338 --> 01:22:10.678]  Gone!
[01:22:11.159 --> 01:22:11.499]  Gone!
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:15.761]  We need to be a self-sustaining economy.
[01:22:15.781 --> 01:22:18.603]  You know, I'll tell you a quick story.
[01:22:19.783 --> 01:22:28.108]  I have a photograph of me and John Connolly, the former governor of Texas that took the bullet in his back, sitting in front of Kennedy.
[01:22:28.448 --> 01:22:30.629]  Me, him and his wife out in front of the book depository.
[01:22:30.689 --> 01:22:38.232]   First time back, it was since the, it was 1992, since the Uh, since the assassination.
[01:22:38.632 --> 01:22:43.214]  He wanted to meet me because of my book, Trend Tracking, that came out in 89.
[01:22:43.534 --> 01:22:46.235]  I'd forecast a new third party, someone like Ross Perot.
[01:22:46.775 --> 01:22:50.316]  So anyway, making a long story short here, I'm going back to Al Gore.
[01:22:51.317 --> 01:22:56.078]  The guy that put the meeting together, he loved my book, Trend Tracking.
[01:22:56.118 --> 01:22:57.419]  His name was John Jay Hooker.
[01:22:58.219 --> 01:23:02.801]  John Jay Hooker's brother was the CEO of Hospital Corporation of America.
[01:23:03.331 --> 01:23:13.518]  So first I fly down to Nashville and then we stayed overnight with Hooker and he had his apartment overlooking all of Nashville with him, with Hubert Humphrey, JFK, everybody.
[01:23:13.618 --> 01:23:14.478]  Anyway, Top Gap.
[01:23:15.159 --> 01:23:18.101]  He's driving me around and he says, that's where Al Gore lives.
[01:23:19.522 --> 01:23:20.702]  I said, what's Al Gore like?
[01:23:20.723 --> 01:23:24.585]  He said, an arrogant little boy like his daddy.
[01:23:26.166 --> 01:23:28.368]  And that's what everybody has to understand.
[01:23:29.188 --> 01:23:32.010]  As George Collins said, it's one big club and you ain't it.
[01:23:33.135 --> 01:23:33.895]  Al Gore.
[01:23:34.576 --> 01:23:36.116]  Little Georgie Bush.
[01:23:37.217 --> 01:23:39.037]  Arrogant Andy Cuomo.
[01:23:40.018 --> 01:23:41.318]  One after another.
[01:23:42.138 --> 01:23:43.819]  That Blinken.
[01:23:44.179 --> 01:23:45.000]  I went to Dalton.
[01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:45.800]  I went to Harvard.
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:48.161]  My daddy was ambassador to Hungary.
[01:23:48.421 --> 01:23:51.282]  My uncle was ambassador to Belgium.
[01:23:51.622 --> 01:23:54.403]  I don't know crap, but I'll tell you what to do.
[01:23:54.783 --> 01:23:56.124]  I'm a member of the club.
[01:23:56.544 --> 01:23:57.584]  So here's the deal.
[01:23:58.144 --> 01:23:59.425]  We gotta break up the club.
[01:24:00.464 --> 01:24:03.286]  We got the same crime syndicate running this country.
[01:24:03.886 --> 01:24:04.086]  What?
[01:24:04.366 --> 01:24:05.727]  Since Abraham Lincoln?
[01:24:06.288 --> 01:24:08.069]  Repulsicans and Democrats?
[01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:10.891]  How about a third party?
[01:24:11.771 --> 01:24:13.092]  No, not allowed.
[01:24:13.592 --> 01:24:15.193]  We need a progressive party.
[01:24:15.713 --> 01:24:18.015]  We need a party of the people of the United States.
[01:24:18.335 --> 01:24:19.776]  You know, I launched Occupy Peace.
[01:24:20.076 --> 01:24:20.837]  I'm not promoting it.
[01:24:20.857 --> 01:24:22.318]  I'm just telling you what the foundation is.
[01:24:22.918 --> 01:24:24.739]  Close all the bases overseas.
[01:24:24.779 --> 01:24:27.201]  What are you, 800 bases in about 70 countries?
[01:24:29.071 --> 01:24:38.454]  Use the troops to secure the homeland and put them to work to rebuild our third world infrastructure and you want to go to war?
[01:24:39.314 --> 01:24:40.274]  Let the people vote.
[01:24:40.994 --> 01:24:50.317]  So everybody listening, do you want your money going to Ukraine, going to Israel, going to fight Yemen?
[01:24:50.357 --> 01:24:53.078]  Do you want your money going there, your tax dollars?
[01:24:53.858 --> 01:24:54.378]  Yes or no?
[01:24:55.177 --> 01:24:55.998]  Let the people decide.
[01:24:56.298 --> 01:24:56.498]  I agree.
[01:24:56.518 --> 01:24:57.278]  Let me ask you this.
[01:24:57.639 --> 01:25:09.847]  What do you see in the election, with only 290-something days left, how they're trying to take Trump off the ballot, how they're so weaponized, they're only escalating, even though it's blown up in their face, and the indictments have supercharged Trump, they're not stopping.
[01:25:09.867 --> 01:25:14.930]  Meanwhile, Biden is on vacation half the time, doesn't know who he is.
[01:25:15.291 --> 01:25:18.493]  Here's a joke campaign ad that Trump just put out.
[01:25:18.513 --> 01:25:18.853]  Here it is.
[01:25:19.513 --> 01:25:20.754]  White House Senior Living.
[01:25:21.315 --> 01:25:23.056]  Our residents feel right at home.
[01:25:24.301 --> 01:25:33.684]  Our vibrant facility offers delightful activities and outings, round-the-clock professional care, and exquisite house-made meals.
[01:25:34.205 --> 01:25:38.866]  I've been eating and everything is put in front of me, but I've been eating all Italian foods, basically.
[01:25:38.986 --> 01:25:39.466]  And ice cream.
[01:25:39.786 --> 01:25:40.327]  And ice cream.
[01:25:40.387 --> 01:25:41.147]  Chocolate chip ice cream.
[01:25:41.947 --> 01:25:46.269]  White House Senior Living, where residents feel like presidents.
[01:25:46.889 --> 01:25:52.311]  You know, we make jokes about there's a lot of competent people, you know, that are his age, but he's certainly not.
[01:25:53.251 --> 01:26:01.357]  This shows with Lloyd Austin being gone for weeks, lying where he was, may not even be alive, I mean literally huge infection, and he's got the nuclear football.
[01:26:01.577 --> 01:26:04.579]  You're right, the incompetence is the most dangerous thing.
[01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:07.601]  And that arrogant Lloyd Austin.
[01:26:08.222 --> 01:26:10.323]  How many people did he kill as general in Iraq?
[01:26:10.363 --> 01:26:13.205]  How many did he kill in Afghanistan?
[01:26:13.685 --> 01:26:16.387]  And what was his last job before he came on to the White House?
[01:26:18.684 --> 01:26:23.948]  Sat on the board of directors of Raytheon, the second largest defense contractor in the United States?
[01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:27.471]  It's not a revolving door, it's an open door.
[01:26:28.492 --> 01:26:31.795]  Again, when we go back, again, it's just showing it.
[01:26:32.195 --> 01:26:34.217]  Look who our Treasury Secretary is.
[01:26:34.837 --> 01:26:34.978]  Ms.
[01:26:35.018 --> 01:26:37.039]  Fatsia Brut, Janet Yellen.
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:38.661]  What was the last job?
[01:26:39.261 --> 01:26:40.222]  Oh, she was the Fed head?
[01:26:40.482 --> 01:26:40.942]  Wait a minute.
[01:26:41.223 --> 01:26:44.866]  The former head of the Federal Reserve is now our Treasury Secretary?
[01:26:45.766 --> 01:26:47.488]  Yes, Salenti, get it in your head.
[01:26:48.519 --> 01:26:56.943]  The banksters, the military-industrial complex, the drug dealers that people call Big Pharma, and the geeks who are in charge of our government.
[01:26:56.984 --> 01:26:58.304]  And by the way, let's talk about this.
[01:26:58.404 --> 01:27:01.926]  Even for the war hawks that love war and all this, look at the F-35.
[01:27:02.026 --> 01:27:02.987]  Total piece of crap.
[01:27:03.047 --> 01:27:04.107]  Costs 20 times more.
[01:27:04.507 --> 01:27:05.728]  It's just all a big scam.
[01:27:06.889 --> 01:27:07.249]  That's it.
[01:27:08.229 --> 01:27:11.411]  So, going back, what about the elections?
[01:27:12.292 --> 01:27:14.413]  You know, again, my background.
[01:27:15.353 --> 01:27:20.613]   I began my career Running political campaigns in Westchester County.
[01:27:20.893 --> 01:27:21.793]  And you told the story.
[01:27:21.853 --> 01:27:26.814]  You saw how incompetent and arrogant and stupid they were when you even went to the state and federal level.
[01:27:26.834 --> 01:27:29.075]  You've told the story, but a brief recap.
[01:27:29.095 --> 01:27:30.235]  Yeah.
[01:27:30.435 --> 01:27:37.918]  But anyway, I also designed and instructed a course called American Politics and Campaign Technology.
[01:27:38.838 --> 01:27:41.859]  It was how to run political campaigns and I taught it at St.
[01:27:41.899 --> 01:27:42.759]  John's University.
[01:27:43.719 --> 01:27:44.439]  I know this game.
[01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:57.118]   So you asked me about By the way, the reason I hit the top, because I've been working all my life in the campaign business, is because most of the people that are in there are losers.
[01:27:57.878 --> 01:27:59.359]  They're arrogant little stupid losers.
[01:28:00.219 --> 01:28:03.141]  That's why I hit the top real quick, because I've been working all my life.
[01:28:03.361 --> 01:28:05.762]  Didn't get allowances, daddy didn't leave me money, you know.
[01:28:06.442 --> 01:28:12.004]  So, going back to this campaign coming up, people are asking me, what do I think that's going to happen?
[01:28:13.305 --> 01:28:15.806]  It is a total wild guess.
[01:28:18.007 --> 01:28:20.208]  It is a total wild guess.
[01:28:20.308 --> 01:28:35.195]  And again, you go back to the Trends Journal, May of 2016, we had forecast that Trump would beat Hillary Clinton while Clinton was way up in the polls.
[01:28:36.176 --> 01:28:38.057]  So it's going on now, Alex.
[01:28:39.097 --> 01:28:41.459]  Nobody, nobody knows what's going to happen.
[01:28:42.459 --> 01:28:44.380]  And again, we got these wars going on.
[01:28:45.359 --> 01:28:54.107]  You know, where's the candidate coming out that's saying, alright, I get elected, we're going to cut back this federal government big time.
[01:28:55.067 --> 01:29:05.256]  You've got this moron, rotten hell, Woodrow Wilson, who gave us the Federal Reserve, World War I, and federal income tax.
[01:29:05.416 --> 01:29:08.219]  I was about to say, what do you make of Bukele?
[01:29:08.239 --> 01:29:11.762]  Because he's good on economics, but he's been somewhat pro-war.
[01:29:14.706 --> 01:29:15.707]  He ain't gonna go anywhere.
[01:29:16.768 --> 01:29:17.308]  Not gonna happen.
[01:29:17.368 --> 01:29:18.389]  Let's go back to what you were saying.
[01:29:18.729 --> 01:29:24.894]  They'd already printed up 250-something thousand copies of Newsweek saying, Madam President, they didn't expect Trump.
[01:29:24.954 --> 01:29:27.496]  You predicted him and so did I. Basically nobody else.
[01:29:27.936 --> 01:29:29.157]  I could see the populist support.
[01:29:29.317 --> 01:29:33.340]  I see him winning a landslide, but there's so much fraud they could assassinate him.
[01:29:33.721 --> 01:29:34.301]  I agree with you.
[01:29:34.321 --> 01:29:36.583]  I think this is a very dangerous time of change.
[01:29:37.624 --> 01:29:37.924]  It is.
[01:29:38.124 --> 01:29:38.685]  I'm telling you.
[01:29:39.125 --> 01:29:40.386]  That's my greatest concern.
[01:29:41.474 --> 01:29:43.536]  I mean, it's right in front of everybody's eyes.
[01:29:44.177 --> 01:29:48.701]  And again, before I was going on about, you know, the dot-com bust.
[01:29:48.801 --> 01:29:50.823]  By the way, I found the article here.
[01:29:50.843 --> 01:29:54.826]  And I got to go back to George Bush because it's very important.
[01:29:55.667 --> 01:29:58.410]  This is when it was a quarterly, fall 1999.
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:10.228]  Dot-com overload will short-circuit many high expectations for huge profits in internet commerce, entertainment, and a wide array of dot-com services.
[01:30:10.749 --> 01:30:23.619]  Following the holiday season, many of today's high-flying internet stocks, the hottest IPOs, and newly emerging IPO wannabes will have begun their deep descent from their overvalued heights.
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:26.542]  And we said it would fail by the second quarter of 2000.
[01:30:28.163 --> 01:30:29.483]  And it did, it failed in March.
[01:30:29.563 --> 01:30:32.744]  Now let's go to George Bush and how the people follow so easily.
[01:30:33.844 --> 01:30:45.527]  How can anybody with a brain bigger than a pea follow orders from this little daddy's boy, born on third base, thought he had a home run, a little moron of a freak.
[01:30:46.248 --> 01:30:51.689]  His quote, we're going to get that guy Osama bin Laden, get him alive.
[01:30:55.153 --> 01:31:12.828]  Over 80% of the American people followed that jerk to our longest war in American history that caused us, the plantation workers of Slavelandia, our tax dollars, to feed the military-industrial complex.
[01:31:12.848 --> 01:31:17.972]  And, Gerald, we all agree, and it seems like people all agree those were frauds, but now they're not protesting the new war.
[01:31:18.032 --> 01:31:20.594]  So, we only got like 14 minutes left.
[01:31:20.934 --> 01:31:22.536]  Let's get into the rest of the trends for this year.
[01:31:23.542 --> 01:31:24.762]  Okay, let's go to the here.
[01:31:24.983 --> 01:31:25.963]  This is the big one.
[01:31:26.163 --> 01:31:27.183]  It's very another big one.
[01:31:28.004 --> 01:31:31.305]  Last year, one of our top trends was office building bust.
[01:31:32.005 --> 01:31:34.726]  We had forecast this would happen when they locked down everybody.
[01:31:35.727 --> 01:31:43.589]  Your office occupancy rate mean people going back to office according to Castle Systems with a K is at 50%.
[01:31:45.450 --> 01:31:48.471]  All the businesses that depended on commuters, they're going out of business.
[01:31:49.972 --> 01:31:55.737]   Now, One of our top trends for this year is banks go bust.
[01:31:56.318 --> 01:32:02.620]  This is an article from Tuesday's Wall Street Journal.
[01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:09.582]  Nearly a fifth of office space sits vacant, highest on record.
[01:32:10.362 --> 01:32:14.304]  Wow, blow me away, never would have known that.
[01:32:14.324 --> 01:32:16.024]  20% of the buildings are vacant.
[01:32:16.044 --> 01:32:18.545]  50% occupancy rate.
[01:32:21.966 --> 01:32:23.547]  People aren't going back to work.
[01:32:24.087 --> 01:32:25.408]  Let's say I had 10 stories.
[01:32:25.428 --> 01:32:27.169]  Yes, they come back three days a week.
[01:32:27.189 --> 01:32:28.229]  I don't need all this space.
[01:32:29.130 --> 01:32:31.011]  Now, I'm the guy that owns the building.
[01:32:32.651 --> 01:32:33.932]  I got revolving leases.
[01:32:35.393 --> 01:32:36.934]  Oh, the interest rates are way up.
[01:32:37.054 --> 01:32:38.074]  I got less tenants.
[01:32:39.255 --> 01:32:41.036]  I'm going to default on my loan.
[01:32:41.736 --> 01:32:56.757]   You're going to see defaults on loans on office buildings We're going to have a banking crisis that made the one that began last March with the Silicon Valley Bank that went bust look like nothing.
[01:32:57.298 --> 01:33:00.098]  Look like nothing.
[01:33:00.298 --> 01:33:09.842]  The money for the commercial buildings is mostly funded by small and medium-sized banks, which also means the bigs are going to get bigger when this thing goes down.
[01:33:10.242 --> 01:33:11.602]  But it ain't going to go down like that.
[01:33:12.002 --> 01:33:17.199]   This is going to be the biggest banking crisis in A History of the World, Part 1 and Part 2.
[01:33:18.641 --> 01:33:24.668]  And, oh by the way, this was a cover of one of our Trends journals, when I talk about how the banksters are in charge.
[01:33:25.148 --> 01:33:29.513]  Yeah, the Prince of Peace became violent to drive the money changers out of the Temple.
[01:33:30.014 --> 01:33:31.015]  So that's what's going to go on.
[01:33:31.593 --> 01:33:31.993]  He's back.
[01:33:32.374 --> 01:33:37.158]  Alex, there's no way, no, oh, oh, we're going to turn them into apartment houses.
[01:33:37.638 --> 01:33:38.219]  No, you're not.
[01:33:38.539 --> 01:33:41.982]  The buildings built in the last 50 years are non-convertible.
[01:33:42.382 --> 01:33:46.926]  These big, ugly, open spaces back in the old days used to have rooms with toilets.
[01:33:47.166 --> 01:33:47.747]  No more.
[01:33:48.007 --> 01:33:49.428]  They're non-convertible.
[01:33:50.009 --> 01:33:54.192]  Oh, and down where you are over there, Austin has one of the highest vacancy rates.
[01:33:57.275 --> 01:33:58.656]  Let's move to the next big trend.
[01:34:00.888 --> 01:34:01.669]  Migrant madness.
[01:34:01.909 --> 01:34:04.690]  This is going to be a big, big, big, big, big issue.
[01:34:05.031 --> 01:34:07.993]  If you think it's been bad so far, it's going exponentially up.
[01:34:09.113 --> 01:34:11.375]  Again, let's go back to the Trends Journal.
[01:34:11.755 --> 01:34:12.456]  Top trends for 2020.
[01:34:12.856 --> 01:34:16.738]  This is just before the COVID war gets out.
[01:34:16.778 --> 01:34:19.720]  You know, we put them out early, you know, first week of January.
[01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:25.784]  The COVID war begins the next week when China launched it on their Chinese Lunar New Year, the year of the rat.
[01:34:28.046 --> 01:34:28.666]  Let's go back. 2019.
[01:34:31.405 --> 01:34:32.645]  Yellow vests in France.
[01:34:33.806 --> 01:34:43.888]  Protests going on in Lebanon, South Africa, Algeria, India, Chile, Bolivia, all over the world.
[01:34:44.488 --> 01:34:45.888]  People taking to their streets.
[01:34:46.728 --> 01:34:47.668]  Taking to the streets.
[01:34:48.188 --> 01:34:48.428]  Why?
[01:34:48.969 --> 01:34:52.009]  Lack of basic living standards, government corruption, crime and violence.
[01:34:52.929 --> 01:34:58.110]  And the refugee crisis is swarming then, nothing compared to now.
[01:34:58.570 --> 01:35:00.591]  Now, let's go back and look at the trends.
[01:35:00.911 --> 01:35:10.786]   Hey, Did you hear this week again, the World Bank, or is it the World Banksters, came out and said, Europe is going to have the worst year in 30 years.
[01:35:11.986 --> 01:35:13.727]  Oh, Europe's going to have a lousy year?
[01:35:14.308 --> 01:35:17.149]  It's going to be great down there in Ecuador.
[01:35:17.770 --> 01:35:20.091]  Lovely, lovely time in Colombia.
[01:35:20.111 --> 01:35:22.953]  All in Sudan, you're going to be smiling.
[01:35:23.854 --> 01:35:26.055]  This thing's going down bad all over the world.
[01:35:26.835 --> 01:35:29.257]  These people are going to do everything they can to escape.
[01:35:29.924 --> 01:35:31.284]  We haven't seen it yet.
[01:35:31.645 --> 01:35:36.646]  And again, let's go back to when it happened and how bad it got and who made it happen.
[01:35:37.326 --> 01:35:46.269]  The Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner, Barack Obama, along with that slimeball Sarkozy in France and Cameron in the UK.
[01:35:47.090 --> 01:35:52.511]  And along with, if only women were in charge, Hillary Clinton, Samantha Power, and Susan Rice.
[01:35:53.372 --> 01:35:54.892]  Gaddafi has to go.
[01:35:54.912 --> 01:35:57.053]  We gotta get him out of there.
[01:35:57.816 --> 01:36:02.177]  Oh, you mean the richest country in Africa where people had more rights and benefits than most of the world's?
[01:36:02.557 --> 01:36:03.537]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:36:03.998 --> 01:36:06.298]  They got the richest oil deposits in the world.
[01:36:06.318 --> 01:36:07.438]  We get it really easy.
[01:36:07.678 --> 01:36:11.279]  You think we invaded Iraq because their major export was broccoli?
[01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:14.860]  So what did Qaddafi do?
[01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:17.241]  You could Google it up and you could see the video.
[01:36:18.361 --> 01:36:19.241]  He warns Europe.
[01:36:20.802 --> 01:36:21.742]  You take me out.
[01:36:23.024 --> 01:36:33.868]  You're going to have a refugee crisis, a migrant crisis that you won't be able to handle because I've been stopping them from coming, leaving Libya and going into right over there is Spain.
[01:36:33.928 --> 01:36:36.089]  Here's Italy that far away.
[01:36:36.109 --> 01:36:37.750]  And what did they do?
[01:36:38.290 --> 01:36:41.411]  That's when it got really, really, really bad.
[01:36:42.232 --> 01:36:46.333]  Again, there is this is a major campaign issue.
[01:36:46.813 --> 01:36:50.755]  The two that should be focused on are the migrants, migrant madness.
[01:36:51.474 --> 01:36:53.575]  And again, look at what they're doing in California.
[01:36:53.835 --> 01:36:57.036]  They're stealing taxpayer money and giving them, what, $300 or something?
[01:36:57.376 --> 01:36:58.137]  Look at New York.
[01:36:58.177 --> 01:36:59.317]  New York's a crap show.
[01:36:59.717 --> 01:37:00.618]  You know, I'm a New Yorker.
[01:37:00.838 --> 01:37:06.900]  You go down to New York between the homeless and all of the migrants out there, it's a freak show.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.341]  I've been to New York probably 20 times in my life.
[01:37:09.961 --> 01:37:15.283]  And when it's roaring and it's got good management, there's all the shows, and the food, and the people, and it's great.
[01:37:15.563 --> 01:37:17.244]  But when it's got bad management, it's hell.
[01:37:17.524 --> 01:37:27.868]  And I was there two years ago, and I'm told it's much worse now, and it was garbage, rats, crime, and just gay pride flags everywhere for whatever reason, and just libtard insanity.
[01:37:28.228 --> 01:37:34.130]  And now, the Democrats, Hochul, and also the mayor, said, come here, come here.
[01:37:34.411 --> 01:37:35.991]  Within one year, they're like, don't come here.
[01:37:36.691 --> 01:37:37.792]  It's very schizophrenic.
[01:37:39.326 --> 01:37:40.286]  They're freaks.
[01:37:42.187 --> 01:37:45.109]  They're freaks that are running the show.
[01:37:46.289 --> 01:37:47.570]  They're arrogant little people.
[01:37:47.630 --> 01:37:50.612]  Again, I was the assistant to the Secretary of the New York State Senate.
[01:37:50.972 --> 01:37:52.753]  When I quit my job, nobody could believe it.
[01:37:52.793 --> 01:37:55.534]  I said, I'm not going to suck my way up to the top.
[01:37:56.488 --> 01:38:01.693]  These are the people you hated in high school and college that wanted to be class president and head of the student council.
[01:38:01.713 --> 01:38:03.855]  They're the dumbest little pieces of nobody.
[01:38:04.036 --> 01:38:07.739]  And you go back to this because this is what kills countries and empires.
[01:38:07.759 --> 01:38:08.400]  You keep going back.
[01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:10.602]  That's what meritocracy is, what made America great.
[01:38:10.622 --> 01:38:14.106]  We never fully embraced it, but more than other countries, that's what made us.
[01:38:14.126 --> 01:38:16.308]  You could come here and it was a meritocracy.
[01:38:16.328 --> 01:38:16.928]  It wasn't perfect.
[01:38:17.589 --> 01:38:23.191]  These are literally blue-blood inbreds and their minions that don't know anything, but they have arrogance.
[01:38:23.772 --> 01:38:26.333]  And that ends with nuclear weapons and total destruction.
[01:38:27.233 --> 01:38:27.433]  Yeah.
[01:38:27.994 --> 01:38:30.074]  Arrogance, and they want money and power.
[01:38:30.955 --> 01:38:31.335]  That's all.
[01:38:31.675 --> 01:38:34.396]  Look at the money that these politicians are worth.
[01:38:34.876 --> 01:38:35.857]  Look at the money they're worth.
[01:38:35.957 --> 01:38:39.578]  Oh, they get to Congress worth nothing, and in a couple years they're worth $50 million.
[01:38:39.619 --> 01:38:40.299]  What's going on?
[01:38:41.644 --> 01:38:42.504]  It's called payoffs.
[01:38:42.624 --> 01:38:45.886]  Bribes and payoffs that morons and imbeciles call campaign contracts.
[01:38:45.906 --> 01:38:48.967]  Remember when Congress a decade ago was under pressure over insider trading?
[01:38:49.227 --> 01:38:50.227]  They just legalized it.
[01:38:51.328 --> 01:38:51.468]  Yeah.
[01:38:52.708 --> 01:38:55.109]  So in closing, Gerald, in closing, we're out of time.
[01:38:55.129 --> 01:38:56.410]  A couple minutes here.
[01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:57.710]  What are the solutions?
[01:38:57.810 --> 01:38:59.731]  What's the silver lining here?
[01:39:01.732 --> 01:39:03.612]  United we stand, divided we die.
[01:39:03.652 --> 01:39:05.893]  We have to unite under one umbrella for peace.
[01:39:06.213 --> 01:39:07.234]  That's the only way I see it.
[01:39:07.294 --> 01:39:10.355]  And again, the billionaires could make it happen.
[01:39:10.962 --> 01:39:11.683]  We have to unite.
[01:39:11.763 --> 01:39:13.024]  We need a new third party.
[01:39:13.605 --> 01:39:14.426]  That's number one.
[01:39:14.506 --> 01:39:15.067]  Well, that's right.
[01:39:15.087 --> 01:39:27.881]  The smarter billionaires have got to put the brakes on and call for peace and real economic recovery and innovation because their money will be worth nothing in a dystopia, in a post-industrial... Klaus Schwab wants to have a post-industrial world for 90% of people?
[01:39:28.181 --> 01:39:29.983]  Why would rich people want to live in a world like that?
[01:39:30.003 --> 01:39:30.764]  That's stupid!
[01:39:31.846 --> 01:39:36.930]  How about being so stupid you're gonna build a bomb shelter in case a nuclear bomb goes off?
[01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:39.112]  Isn't life gonna be lovely after that?
[01:39:39.132 --> 01:39:39.752]  It's a tomb!
[01:39:40.053 --> 01:39:44.876]  Plus, everybody knows Zuckerberg and all of them where their base is when they're starving, they're all coming there!
[01:39:46.698 --> 01:39:52.442]  Again, the COVID war killed, you know, I grew up in a time of, you know, wild, great times.
[01:39:52.722 --> 01:39:54.104]  Now it's dead at night.
[01:39:54.484 --> 01:39:56.245]  The COVID war killed everything.
[01:39:56.626 --> 01:39:58.347]  Drove all the vibe out of life.
[01:39:58.996 --> 01:40:03.861]  There's no fun anymore, and this is gonna- so the people already used to bad times.
[01:40:04.822 --> 01:40:06.243]  Again, they're not fighting back.
[01:40:06.763 --> 01:40:08.705]  And unless we fight back, we're finished.
[01:40:08.725 --> 01:40:10.687]  And I'm talking about peaceful fight.
[01:40:11.268 --> 01:40:15.752]  I'm a warrior for the- No, no, they always spin it when we say fight for our future, for our freedom.
[01:40:16.072 --> 01:40:19.055]  It's not that we're scared to fight violently, but that- that's what they want.
[01:40:19.315 --> 01:40:20.516]  We're winning intellectually.
[01:40:20.596 --> 01:40:21.818]  We want to peacefully fix this.
[01:40:22.158 --> 01:40:25.241]   Gerald Celente, You're a great American.
[01:40:25.261 --> 01:40:25.641]  We love you.

[01:40:29.404 --> 01:40:30.265]  Nothing better out there.
[01:40:30.305 --> 01:40:31.346]  We get some of the support as well.
[01:40:31.566 --> 01:40:34.648]  People want to support you, get great information, great research, and support us.

[01:40:36.910 --> 01:40:39.412]  Gerald Cilente, we're still alive in 2024.
[01:40:39.693 --> 01:40:40.433]  That's the good news.
[01:40:40.473 --> 01:40:41.014]  Talk to you soon.
[01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:42.760]  Thank you so much.
[01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:44.101]  I really appreciate being on.
[01:40:44.341 --> 01:40:46.442]  And I love that super male vitality.
[01:40:46.702 --> 01:40:46.862]  Poof!
[01:40:47.242 --> 01:40:48.063]  Keeps me going.
[01:40:48.103 --> 01:40:49.003]  Keeps me going.
[01:40:49.643 --> 01:40:50.464]  What a great American.
[01:40:50.524 --> 01:40:51.184]  A true American.
[01:40:51.204 --> 01:40:51.944]  Gerald Celente.
[01:40:52.325 --> 01:40:53.665]  Doesn't get any more Americana than that.
[01:40:54.506 --> 01:40:55.126]  Alright, look.
[01:40:56.314 --> 01:40:57.855]  I covered like a third of the news so far.
[01:40:58.576 --> 01:41:02.758]  I'm gonna go to break, and I'm gonna come back, and I'm gonna nail it for the next hour.
[01:41:03.439 --> 01:41:04.980]  Nail it, nail it, nail it, nail it.
[01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:06.981]  And then who's host of the fourth hour?
[01:41:07.021 --> 01:41:07.922]  I forgot, I didn't look.
[01:41:08.662 --> 01:41:10.063]  What great American we got in there.
[01:41:10.563 --> 01:41:12.024]  Jay Dyer, oh yeah, it's Friday.
[01:41:12.705 --> 01:41:20.510]  Expert on the New World Order, he just goes off their own documents, just like we do, but I've read all these documents years ago, I'll just tell you what they're up to.
[01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:22.091]  He actually goes over them all.
[01:41:23.148 --> 01:41:26.390]  But that's in a little over an hour from now.
[01:41:26.670 --> 01:41:30.432]  I am going to come back, and I'm going to get into good news.
[01:41:31.752 --> 01:41:33.513]  I've got some really good news here.
[01:41:35.334 --> 01:41:36.955]  And I've got some really bad news.
[01:41:38.576 --> 01:41:40.637]  Oh my goodness, we've got some news for you today here.
[01:41:41.437 --> 01:41:45.439]  But it's all coming up in the third hour today.
[01:41:48.781 --> 01:41:50.522]  And then who knows, I might just come in here tomorrow.
[01:41:52.898 --> 01:41:53.318]  You know what?
[01:41:55.259 --> 01:41:55.499]  No.
[01:41:56.639 --> 01:41:59.840]  I'm gonna take my daughter hiking.
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:11.624]  She wants to go hike in the woods and build a fire and take a little backpack with some food in it and cook over the fire.
[01:42:11.644 --> 01:42:13.884]  I don't have land to do that in Austin.
[01:42:13.924 --> 01:42:15.125]  I don't know where to go or nobody's out.
[01:42:15.665 --> 01:42:19.386]  So I'm gonna take off tomorrow, but I'll be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:42:20.266 --> 01:42:20.886]  for the Sunday show.
[01:42:20.906 --> 01:42:22.507]  But I'm not done, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:23.632 --> 01:42:24.293]  I'm not done.
[01:42:24.313 --> 01:42:29.616]  I'm gonna come back for a full hour and you've got my dedication to hit it and hit it hard.
[01:42:29.656 --> 01:42:34.700]  But first, since you mentioned it, we got a couple of George Carlin clips.
[01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:39.564]  First on the big club and then one on vaccines and being afraid of germs.
[01:42:40.404 --> 01:42:44.628]  We'll play both those when we come back and then plunge into all the news.
[01:42:47.990 --> 01:42:49.151]  It's never gonna get any better.
[01:42:49.531 --> 01:42:50.272]  Don't look for it.
[01:42:50.692 --> 01:42:51.773]  Be happy with what you got.
[01:42:52.933 --> 01:42:56.016]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[01:42:56.536 --> 01:42:58.197]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[01:42:58.598 --> 01:43:04.242]  The real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[01:43:04.623 --> 01:43:05.844]  Forget the politicians.
[01:43:06.084 --> 01:43:09.346]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[01:43:10.928 --> 01:43:11.388]  You don't.
[01:43:12.149 --> 01:43:13.150]  You have no choice.
[01:43:13.510 --> 01:43:14.451]  You have owners.
[01:43:14.751 --> 01:43:15.672]  They own you.
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.282]  They own everything.
[01:43:18.302 --> 01:43:20.184]  They own all the important land.
[01:43:20.545 --> 01:43:22.287]  They own and control the corporations.
[01:43:22.327 --> 01:43:25.792]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls.
[01:43:25.812 --> 01:43:27.394]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[01:43:27.715 --> 01:43:32.541]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[01:43:32.721 --> 01:43:34.344]  They got you by the balls!
[01:43:35.837 --> 01:43:37.898]  They want obedient workers.
[01:43:38.378 --> 01:43:39.878]  Obedient workers.
[01:43:40.199 --> 01:43:52.903]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[01:43:52.963 --> 01:43:56.204]  And now, they're coming for your social security money.
[01:43:56.664 --> 01:43:59.345]  So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[01:44:00.746 --> 01:44:01.646]  It's a big club.
[01:44:02.634 --> 01:44:03.695]  And you ain't in it.
[01:44:03.715 --> 01:44:08.998]  You said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.
[01:44:09.358 --> 01:44:10.219]  You better believe it.
[01:44:10.339 --> 01:44:12.220]  So what specifically did they do?
[01:44:12.661 --> 01:44:17.824]  If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage I've given to, just so you understand.
[01:44:18.044 --> 01:44:18.644]  A lot of money.
[01:44:19.265 --> 01:44:21.987]  You and I are not in the big club.
[01:44:22.347 --> 01:44:24.268]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[01:44:24.908 --> 01:44:28.631]  It's called the American dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[01:44:30.034 --> 01:44:31.516]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[01:44:31.536 --> 01:44:35.380]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:39.324]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[01:44:39.345 --> 01:44:40.306]  They're not interested in that.
[01:44:40.606 --> 01:44:41.487]  That doesn't help them.
[01:44:41.927 --> 01:44:43.269]  That's against their interest.
[01:44:44.090 --> 01:44:45.491]  Because that's what Americans do now.
[01:44:45.652 --> 01:44:52.539]   They're always willing to trade away a little of their freedom In exchange for the feeling, the illusion of security.
[01:44:52.780 --> 01:45:03.512]  What we have now is a completely neurotic population obsessed with security and safety and crime and drugs and cleanliness and hygiene and germs.
[01:45:03.873 --> 01:45:04.714]  There's another thing.
[01:45:05.154 --> 01:45:05.674]  Germs.
[01:45:06.074 --> 01:45:08.375]  Where did this sudden fear of germs come from?
[01:45:08.795 --> 01:45:09.435]  In this country.
[01:45:09.475 --> 01:45:10.275]  Have you noticed this?
[01:45:10.575 --> 01:45:28.180]  The media, constantly running stories about all the latest infections, Salmonella, E. coli, Hantavirus, bird flu, and Americans are, they panic easily, so now everybody's running around, scrubbing this and spraying that, and overcooking their food, and repeatedly washing their hands, trying to avoid all contact with germs.
[01:45:28.540 --> 01:45:31.560]  It's ridiculous, and it goes to ridiculous lengths.
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.021]  Fear of germs.
[01:45:33.101 --> 01:45:34.201]  Why, these f***ers.
[01:45:34.981 --> 01:45:38.262]  Hey, where's your sense of adventure?
[01:45:38.322 --> 01:45:39.842]  Take a f***ing chance, will ya?
[01:45:40.943 --> 01:45:44.083]  Besides, what do you think you have an immune system for?
[01:45:44.603 --> 01:45:45.984]  It's for killing germs!
[01:45:46.564 --> 01:45:47.624]  But it needs practice.
[01:45:47.964 --> 01:45:49.865]  It needs germs to practice on.
[01:45:51.665 --> 01:45:53.165]  So, so listen.
[01:45:54.706 --> 01:45:55.206]  So listen.
[01:45:57.415 --> 01:46:04.099]  If you kill all the germs around you and live a completely sterile life, then when germs do come along, you're not going to be prepared.
[01:46:04.340 --> 01:46:05.801]  And never mind ordinary germs.
[01:46:06.081 --> 01:46:10.864]  What are you going to do when some super virus comes along that turns your vital organs into liquid sh**?
[01:46:12.465 --> 01:46:13.406]  I'll tell you what you're going to do.
[01:46:13.226 --> 01:46:16.105]   do you're gonna get sick you're gonna die and you're gonna deserve it cuz
[01:46:16.105 --> 01:46:20.985]   you're f*cking weak and you got a f*cking weak immune system
[01:46:20.985 --> 01:46:37.118]   let me tell you a true story about immunization okay When I was a little boy in New York City in the 1940s, we swam in the Hudson River, and it was filled with raw sewage, okay?
[01:46:37.638 --> 01:46:39.419]  We swam in raw sewage.
[01:46:39.819 --> 01:46:41.159]  You know, to cool off!
[01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:45.500]  And at that time, the big fear was polio.
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:47.860]  Thousands of kids died from polio every year.
[01:46:48.021 --> 01:46:48.681]  But you know something?
[01:46:48.861 --> 01:46:51.001]  In my neighborhood, no one ever got polio.
[01:46:51.101 --> 01:46:51.601]  No one.
[01:46:51.801 --> 01:46:52.061]  Ever.
[01:46:52.281 --> 01:46:52.842]  You know why?
[01:46:52.862 --> 01:46:55.022]  Because we swam in raw sewage!
[01:46:56.596 --> 01:46:58.679]  It strengthened our immune systems.
[01:46:59.039 --> 01:47:00.561]  The polio never had a prayer.
[01:47:00.621 --> 01:47:02.404]  We were tempered in raw sh**.
[01:47:05.087 --> 01:47:05.828]  That's actually true.
[01:47:05.848 --> 01:47:09.553]  There's studies in swimming swamp water, which I love to do.
[01:47:09.593 --> 01:47:13.719]  It's better the Caribbean to get like in a river, in a swamp area.
[01:47:14.861 --> 01:47:16.382]  Winter is coming.
[01:47:18.403 --> 01:47:48.403]  Winter is coming.
[01:47:45.613 --> 01:47:46.913]  Winter is here.

[01:49:09.996 --> 01:49:10.496]  last.
[01:49:10.496 --> 01:49:20.496]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:49:11.497 --> 01:49:13.497]  Thermal nuclear war.
[01:49:13.497 --> 01:49:23.497]  Oh my god.
[01:49:23.419 --> 01:49:26.982]  I'm back.
[01:49:27.222 --> 01:49:28.163]  I'm home.
[01:49:30.084 --> 01:49:31.025]  All the time.
[01:49:32.346 --> 01:49:36.409]  We finally, really did it.
[01:49:38.410 --> 01:49:41.032]  You maniacs!
[01:49:41.052 --> 01:49:41.973]  You blew it up!
[01:49:43.594 --> 01:49:45.215]  Oh, damn you!
[01:49:46.336 --> 01:49:50.336]  God damn you all to hell!
[01:49:50.336 --> 01:50:14.336]   From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:50:14.615 --> 01:50:21.895]   I want to thank my incredible crew for working so hard, being so on the spot, and putting
[01:50:21.895 --> 01:50:24.895]  up with me.
[01:50:24.895 --> 01:50:28.375]  Because I'm radioactive.
[01:50:28.375 --> 01:50:37.376]   A weapon forged in the furnaces of tyranny against the enemy.
[01:50:37.376 --> 01:50:39.376]  [Music]
[01:50:39.058 --> 01:50:39.719]  Just like you.
[01:50:42.420 --> 01:50:47.420]  You'll only take your destiny in your hands.
[01:50:47.420 --> 01:51:04.420]  All right, I'm about to cover victory.
[01:51:04.420 --> 01:51:06.420]  [chanting]
[01:51:06.128 --> 01:51:08.309]  And I'm about to cover the keys to victory.
[01:51:09.170 --> 01:51:11.351]  And it's gonna sound so simple, you're gonna say, big deal.
[01:51:12.851 --> 01:51:16.233]  But, if you're thinking that, you're not really thinking.
[01:51:18.955 --> 01:51:31.618]   Right now, To defeat the globalists and derail their plan for planetary collapse, out of which they think they're going to build their New World Order, is very easy.
[01:51:33.299 --> 01:51:47.724]  Very easy if we understand how horrible it's going to be once we are restrained.
[01:51:48.385 --> 01:51:49.385]  And I'll use an analogy.
[01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:52.310]  You could be Mike Tyson in his prime.
[01:51:52.330 --> 01:51:52.310]  1989.
[01:51:54.792 --> 01:52:00.516]  A wrecking machine.
[01:52:01.616 --> 01:52:04.799]  At Tyson's prime, he would have destroyed Muhammad Ali in his prime.
[01:52:05.099 --> 01:52:05.719]  No one can deny it.
[01:52:05.759 --> 01:52:07.841]  But Muhammad Ali lasted decades.
[01:52:07.861 --> 01:52:10.743]  Tyson was only the king for a few years.
[01:52:11.383 --> 01:52:14.045]  He'd hit you with an uppercut with his fist and hit you with the elbow.
[01:52:14.825 --> 01:52:16.687]  He'd come in and savagely destroy you.
[01:52:18.708 --> 01:52:28.705]   But if you Could tie bowling balls to his hands, even if you're a bad boxer, you could maybe beat him.
[01:52:31.086 --> 01:52:44.430]  But if you could put him in a straitjacket and chain him to a wall, well then a little old lady with a baseball bat could kill him in about two minutes.
[01:52:46.410 --> 01:52:49.091]  Might take her a lot of wax, but she's like a piñata, she can get it done.
[01:52:49.974 --> 01:52:53.035]  Like a kid with a club and a piñata, she'd get it done.
[01:52:54.075 --> 01:53:03.059]  Now, America right now, if we knew who we were, and the world knew who we were, people, humanity, is Mike Tyson, 1989.
[01:53:04.119 --> 01:53:07.620]  He's come in, he's beat 20 fighters in a row, nobody can stop him.
[01:53:08.100 --> 01:53:31.475]   But, with the CBDCs, and the ESGs, and the cashless societies, and the inflation, and the open borders, everything, right now, We're being tied up and put in a straitjacket, and we're about to be chained up against a wall, where we can't even use our feet.
[01:53:35.458 --> 01:53:42.143]  Now, what's the power of the Social Credit Score implemented through the CBDC and the Corporate Governance ESG?
[01:53:43.109 --> 01:53:51.196]  And if you're a new listener and don't know what CBDC's are, or ESG's, or social credit scores, you better learn, because it's the whole future, sweetheart.
[01:53:51.756 --> 01:53:53.738]  And I know the general audience is like, we all know what it is.
[01:53:53.758 --> 01:53:55.880]  A lot of you knew about what it was before I did.
[01:53:56.140 --> 01:53:58.662]  The point is, we already know you're on the team.
[01:53:58.702 --> 01:53:59.723]  We're trying to get new people.
[01:54:03.606 --> 01:54:11.293]  If I wanted the show to be entertaining, I'd show you crime footage all day, and funny videos, and you know, we're not, we're not, we're not, this is not entertainment.
[01:54:13.055 --> 01:54:14.076]  I'll try to make it interesting.
[01:54:16.258 --> 01:54:17.560]  And truth is interesting, isn't it?
[01:54:19.382 --> 01:54:22.265]  So, they're coming to the end of their Ponzi scheme.
[01:54:22.285 --> 01:54:23.526]  They're coming to the end of their order.
[01:54:23.546 --> 01:54:24.888]  They're coming to the end of their system.
[01:54:27.216 --> 01:54:38.706]  And they in their own admission say we're going to control your behavior and you won't be able to leave one foot outside your house unless you submit to everything culturally, politically, spiritually we want.
[01:54:39.307 --> 01:54:43.070]  And they already want you to jump really high when they say jump to get this.
[01:54:44.451 --> 01:54:49.936]  The parameters are already set up and war-gamed in Canada.
[01:54:50.857 --> 01:54:52.959]  The Netherlands, those are the capitals of suicide.
[01:54:55.208 --> 01:55:01.333]  State-run suicide, where, oh, we're going to let you have your pain pills for your shattered back from a car wreck for another year.
[01:55:01.373 --> 01:55:03.754]  We've got to sign an agreement to be euthanized on this date.
[01:55:04.375 --> 01:55:07.277]  We put you in a pod, suck the oxygen out, you suffocate.
[01:55:07.737 --> 01:55:09.879]  It's going on every hour in Canada right now.
[01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:14.302]  They kill 30, 40 people a day in Canada right now.
[01:55:15.743 --> 01:55:16.223]  They're healthy.
[01:55:19.406 --> 01:55:21.267]  So the dystopia is already tested.
[01:55:21.347 --> 01:55:22.068]  It's already ready.
[01:55:23.067 --> 01:55:26.089]  And right now, they're going, isn't this jacket nice?
[01:55:26.109 --> 01:55:26.770]  Why don't you put it on?
[01:55:26.790 --> 01:55:28.051]  We're like, hey, that's a straight jacket.
[01:55:29.171 --> 01:55:30.252]  I'm not going to put the jacket on.
[01:55:30.612 --> 01:55:32.734]  And people say, well, how do I not put the jacket on?
[01:55:33.094 --> 01:55:37.837]  You warn your employers, or if you're a business owner, you make a stand, we're not going to be part of this.
[01:55:38.338 --> 01:55:45.723]  You learn about it, you go to city council, state house, attorney generals are battling it, and BlackRock with just two attorney generals.
[01:55:46.752 --> 01:55:56.099]  Fighting them, led by Missouri, has already backed off and their ESG investment's gone from $57 trillion to $25 trillion.
[01:55:56.119 --> 01:55:57.480]  I had the article yesterday, I didn't get to it.
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:02.643]  From $50 plus trillion down to $20 something trillion in one year.
[01:56:03.284 --> 01:56:08.007]  Just because two Attorney Generals, what was it?
[01:56:08.467 --> 01:56:11.309]  Mississippi and Missouri.
[01:56:12.570 --> 01:56:13.251]  Was it Louisiana?
[01:56:13.271 --> 01:56:14.111]  I always get them confused.
[01:56:15.481 --> 01:56:35.500]  The point is, they file some suits, they say we're not putting our pension funds and our government investments in this if you're gonna, you know, do all these horrible agendas of carbon taxes and open borders and critical race theory and transgenerism and just a few states putting up a little fight!
[01:56:38.502 --> 01:56:41.165]  They've lost almost half the value of the ESG scam.
[01:56:44.969 --> 01:56:53.195]  See, what they're selling is like if you go in a restaurant and you say I'd like a chicken fried steak, potatoes and broccoli, and they bring you a pile of dog manure.
[01:56:54.176 --> 01:56:56.418]  You go, I didn't order dog shit, I want food.
[01:56:56.438 --> 01:56:58.379]  And they go, sorry, you're gonna eat this.
[01:56:59.540 --> 01:57:00.041]  What do you do?
[01:57:00.121 --> 01:57:01.602]  You refuse it and you leave.
[01:57:02.062 --> 01:57:05.165]  But what happens when they get all the restaurants in control?
[01:57:05.985 --> 01:57:11.850]  And the money you've got is only good for dog crap.
[01:57:13.786 --> 01:57:45.849]   And by the way, dog crap's way more nutritious, seriously, than chitin protein of bugs, which is extremely carcinogenic, and the top dozen or more, because every time I check it's more companies, it was like six, seven companies five months ago, it was like 14 companies last week, Tyson, all the big ones, ConAgra, That own most of the food you buy at the grocery store, but it's any type of prepared meal.
[01:57:48.592 --> 01:57:50.254]  It's bug proteins already in it, folks.
[01:57:51.356 --> 01:57:52.217]  So, so, skip the break.
[01:57:53.888 --> 01:57:55.029]  What am I trying to get out of here?
[01:57:55.049 --> 01:57:59.994]  They didn't have all these Hollywood stars in the last five years and all these TV shows and movies about how great bugs are.
[01:58:00.054 --> 01:58:03.417]  They didn't put that out there because they weren't planning to put bugs on the menu.
[01:58:03.617 --> 01:58:19.131]  There are already school lunch programs all over Europe, all over the UK, all over Canada, and now even in blue cities like New York and LA, they are serving chicken battered in cricket protein.
[01:58:20.523 --> 01:58:21.563]  Which is poison.
[01:58:21.623 --> 01:58:21.983]  Look it up.
[01:58:22.224 --> 01:58:23.064]  Look up chitin.
[01:58:23.464 --> 01:58:24.044]  Carcinogen.
[01:58:25.464 --> 01:58:27.625]  There's a reason you look at a bug and you don't want to eat it.
[01:58:27.825 --> 01:58:29.286]  Your brain already knows it's not good.
[01:58:29.526 --> 01:58:30.466]  Look at a strawberry.
[01:58:32.547 --> 01:58:33.467]  Look at an egg.
[01:58:34.927 --> 01:58:35.888]  Look at a salad.
[01:58:35.968 --> 01:58:36.488]  You want it.
[01:58:36.548 --> 01:58:37.688]  You look at a cockroach.
[01:58:37.708 --> 01:58:38.128]  You're not hungry.
[01:58:38.208 --> 01:58:40.789]  Because your brain already knows, man, I don't eat that.
[01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:47.171]  In African places, they'll bust into a tree and eat grubs.
[01:58:48.277 --> 01:58:49.237]  Grubs are different.
[01:58:49.797 --> 01:58:51.698]  Grubs don't have chitin, except in the head.
[01:58:53.818 --> 01:58:54.299]  Big giant?
[01:58:55.619 --> 01:58:56.619]  Maggot, basically.
[01:58:57.379 --> 01:58:58.000]  But it eats trees.
[01:58:58.880 --> 01:58:59.760]  And you can eat grubs.
[01:59:02.901 --> 01:59:11.543]  And if you see the remake a few years ago of Blade Runner, it's the future of Blade Runner.
[01:59:11.803 --> 01:59:14.024]  They got the guy out there on his farm, and what's he raising?
[01:59:14.044 --> 01:59:15.004]  He's raising grubs!
[01:59:17.756 --> 01:59:22.022]  But they don't even feed you grubs that you could eat and not get sick from.
[01:59:24.885 --> 01:59:31.534]  They're gonna feed you cricket, and grasshopper, and cockroach, and mealworm.
[01:59:32.175 --> 01:59:33.517]  And mealworm's got a kite and shell.
[01:59:35.697 --> 01:59:38.139]  So you think Soy screwed people up, but listen, I'm ranting.
[01:59:38.539 --> 01:59:48.306]  See, I tend to go down a data highway, and I want to just give you the basic thing, and then I could data highway, like tell you all about this, all about this bug, what this bug does, but you can look it up for yourself.
[01:59:48.326 --> 01:59:49.226]  A lot of you already know about this.
[01:59:50.507 --> 01:59:51.288]  But here's what I'm getting at.
[01:59:52.248 --> 01:59:53.289]  The crew already pulled it up.
[01:59:53.329 --> 01:59:54.710]  Yeah, those are grubs.
[01:59:54.790 --> 01:59:57.612]  There's hardly any chitin in that except in the head and the jaws.
[02:00:00.654 --> 02:00:01.255]  Good grub.
[02:00:01.355 --> 02:00:03.036]  Why we might be eating insects soon.
[02:00:04.551 --> 02:00:07.773]  But they don't even bring grubs out, because they're too hard to raise.
[02:00:07.853 --> 02:00:08.113]  No.
[02:00:09.173 --> 02:00:12.475]  Day one, baby, you get beetles.
[02:00:15.936 --> 02:00:17.357]  Half a beetle is its shell.
[02:00:18.217 --> 02:00:19.138]  Totally poisonous.
[02:00:19.878 --> 02:00:21.499]  Type in chitin, carcinogen.
[02:00:22.680 --> 02:00:23.240]  Carcinogen.
[02:00:24.921 --> 02:00:26.001]  But I'm digressing to the problem.
[02:00:26.021 --> 02:00:26.421]  I'm sorry.
[02:00:26.742 --> 02:00:33.742]  Let me stop for a moment.
[02:00:33.742 --> 02:00:37.061]   I told you 20 years ago they had a plan to make you eat bugs because they said they would.
[02:00:37.454 --> 02:00:38.915]  And they don't just say this stuff for no reason.
[02:00:39.775 --> 02:00:42.537]  In the last five years, all these ads, you're going to eat bugs, you're going to drink sewage.
[02:00:42.557 --> 02:00:47.160]  Bill Gates, hmm, he gets it out of the sewage plant, hmm, that's good water, has a little, hmm.
[02:00:47.821 --> 02:00:50.343]  It's all about what can they make you accept.
[02:00:51.584 --> 02:00:54.586]  So they want to make it as dystopic as possible in the Overton window.
[02:00:55.186 --> 02:00:57.308]  Overton window is what's accepted political views.
[02:00:57.988 --> 02:00:59.869]  Like pedophilia is bad, they're trying to make it normal.
[02:01:00.110 --> 02:01:02.912]  They're trying to move the Overton window to the left.
[02:01:03.737 --> 02:01:05.799]  That's just how the political scientists put it down.
[02:01:06.540 --> 02:01:07.761]  Left-right, it's just a term.
[02:01:08.261 --> 02:01:10.443]  But it is the left pushing it, so it is a left-right issue.
[02:01:12.405 --> 02:01:13.326]  So it's real simple.
[02:01:13.486 --> 02:01:23.435]  If no one eats bugs, if no one accepts bugs, if no one lets their children eat bugs, if no one buys bugs, then their program is dead.
[02:01:24.436 --> 02:01:30.539]   The problem is they've now labeled the EU and the US bugs according to Code numbers.
[02:01:31.339 --> 02:01:35.062]  With words, with letters, with numbers.
[02:01:36.102 --> 02:01:41.966]  So you've got to then know when you're gonna buy some breaded chicken.
[02:01:41.986 --> 02:01:45.268]  Because most of the time you cook a home cooked meal, but sometimes you're busy.
[02:01:45.328 --> 02:01:46.129]  I'm the same way.
[02:01:46.509 --> 02:01:49.111]  I just make a quick salad, throw some chicken strips in the oven.
[02:01:52.693 --> 02:01:56.936]  Maybe get out some frozen french fries, put it in the thing for my daughter.
[02:01:58.854 --> 02:02:02.736]  You gotta read the label, because the breading is bug protein.
[02:02:02.897 --> 02:02:07.680]  Because they want to just get it to where the companies are buying it, and it builds more factories.
[02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:18.466]  Just by getting the breading now, or the pancake mix, they're hiding it right now to build the industry up where you think you're not eating bugs, and almost all of us are eating bugs already.
[02:02:19.487 --> 02:02:21.969]  You gotta read the label real careful, or you're already eating bugs.
[02:02:22.209 --> 02:02:23.490]  And you're like, well I can handle little bugs.
[02:02:23.530 --> 02:02:23.790]  No, no.
[02:02:24.050 --> 02:02:46.090]   They use the money from that To build the industry, to get the money, to expand the factories, and then they target the children in Australia, and the children in Canada, and the children in Sweden, with teachers come and say, we're gonna all give you guys extra credit and give you a little debit card of $20 to buy a toy.
[02:02:46.691 --> 02:02:50.593]  This is, I have the newscast on Australia, but we want you to eat mealworms right now.
[02:02:52.694 --> 02:02:54.355]  They're just getting you ready.
[02:02:54.415 --> 02:03:00.369]   So, so, They're trying to sell you on things that are unnatural, degenerate, and evil.
[02:03:03.332 --> 02:03:15.564]  And all we need to do is expose them and never fund their markets, never eat their synthetic meat, never eat their big burger chains.
[02:03:15.824 --> 02:03:18.827]  Got tens of billions of funding the last few years.
[02:03:19.761 --> 02:03:25.764]  To eat the Wonder Burgers and the Magic Burgers and the Next Level Burgers that were, quote, plant-based.
[02:03:25.784 --> 02:03:26.905]  People got really sick.
[02:03:27.325 --> 02:03:32.128]  It was just all estrogen, all weird soy.
[02:03:31.948 --> 02:03:39.508]  Well of course it's a weapon!
[02:03:39.508 --> 02:03:42.387]   They could have had something with beans and peas and seasoning and...
[02:03:42.367 --> 02:03:44.469]  It wasn't as good as beef, but still tasted good.
[02:03:45.209 --> 02:03:47.451]  Nothing against a vegetarian diet, if that's what you choose.
[02:03:47.831 --> 02:03:48.071]  No.
[02:03:48.192 --> 02:03:49.653]  Day one, it's synthetic crap.
[02:03:50.413 --> 02:04:02.843]  And Bill Gates has billions invested in steaks that are from bacteria they grow from human cells extracted from tumors.
[02:04:05.705 --> 02:04:06.706]  And you say, why would they do that?
[02:04:08.359 --> 02:04:31.488]  Henrietta Lacks, they've only found a few other people that have this, back in the 50s, in a government experiment, they produced billions, billions of pounds of her cancer cell that ate her in like a week.
[02:04:31.528 --> 02:04:35.109]  She had a tumor one day, next day it's 20 pounds, next day it's 40 pounds, she's dead.
[02:04:36.195 --> 02:04:39.919]  You can take that tumor, put it in a closet, and come back 100 years from now, it's alive.
[02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:42.722]  It's called an immortal cell line.
[02:04:43.743 --> 02:04:59.379]  Well, you simply take a vat of gelatin, and they can throw in a handful of Henrietta Lacks that they've reproduced, and it creates a giant vat of a dead black woman.
[02:05:00.606 --> 02:05:03.967]  There's a little kid there, a little white kid, they aborted in the 70s.
[02:05:04.348 --> 02:05:05.808]  He's only got a code number.
[02:05:05.888 --> 02:05:06.669]  No one knows his name.
[02:05:06.989 --> 02:05:07.709]  No, she got a name.
[02:05:08.029 --> 02:05:09.710]  And he's even better.
[02:05:09.730 --> 02:05:17.529]  So you're eating a dead white kid and a dead black woman.
[02:05:17.529 --> 02:05:19.730]  And so they throw it into a vat.
[02:05:19.730 --> 02:05:29.730]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:05:21.892 --> 02:05:26.414]  And then it just grows a big, giant mass that's clear and gelatin.
[02:05:26.674 --> 02:05:33.116]  Then they add dye, and they have 3D printers print marbleding, and even fake bone.
[02:05:33.616 --> 02:05:49.862]  So you think you're getting a T-Bone or a Ribeye, or a Filet Mignon, or a Chateaubriand, or a New York Strip, and you're literally eating cancer cells.
[02:05:51.601 --> 02:05:54.022]  And if you're a new listener and this sounds far out, look it up.
[02:05:54.883 --> 02:06:08.589]  Henrietta Lacks and X7QN91, I forget his number, cause X7, I'm going from memory, it's like X7Q795, this, this, this, this, a baby they aborted at eight months that they, that they tested it.
[02:06:08.649 --> 02:06:10.870]  It had a tumor and it had the same thing as the black lady.
[02:06:11.531 --> 02:06:15.953]  Almost everything that they're engineering comes from a dead black lady and a dead white baby.
[02:06:17.894 --> 02:06:18.814]  It's beyond vampires.
[02:06:19.293 --> 02:06:21.293]  It's beyond science fiction.
[02:06:21.293 --> 02:06:27.293]  Joe Rogan called me up just the other day.
[02:06:27.173 --> 02:06:33.356]  He said, have you seen this video of Peter Nygaard saying he has women have babies, he then sucks their blood out and injects it in him.
[02:06:33.656 --> 02:06:35.677]  And I didn't even say to Joe, yeah, I said that to you five times.
[02:06:37.098 --> 02:06:38.979]  But yeah, I was like, oh yeah, Joe, that's really wild, Joe.
[02:06:41.601 --> 02:06:42.421]  Yeah, it's AGK293 cells.
[02:06:46.719 --> 02:06:47.840]  You can't even keep track of this.
[02:06:47.860 --> 02:06:48.781]  That's what I'm telling you, man.
[02:06:48.841 --> 02:06:54.524]  It's like... Because, you know, Henrietta Lex's family's been suing, saying, hey, you got our grandmother's jeans.
[02:06:55.265 --> 02:06:56.186]  You're misusing them.
[02:06:56.406 --> 02:06:58.107]  Well, we'll just kill babies and get it from them.
[02:07:01.295 --> 02:07:02.516]  But I haven't gotten the solution yet.
[02:07:03.337 --> 02:07:07.240]  I'm just giving you one little window, and are you going to eat bugs?
[02:07:07.260 --> 02:07:08.061]  You're like, no way.
[02:07:08.161 --> 02:07:12.144]  Well, they're putting it in the breading of all the major companies, basically.
[02:07:12.164 --> 02:07:15.507]  I mean, you order a pizza, God knows there's no list of what's in that.
[02:07:15.987 --> 02:07:21.592]  If it's already in half the stuff in the supermarket, which it is now, God knows what's in what you get.
[02:07:23.291 --> 02:07:39.705]  Pizza places and Mexican places and steakhouses and everybody to come out and say, we are not taking any genetically modified food, we're not taking any synthetic meat, we are not selling any bug protein.
[02:07:39.765 --> 02:07:49.114]   And then you go there and you get a law passed where they got to tell you, if you want to go eat fetal cells, which are in Pepsi, Look it up.
[02:07:49.434 --> 02:07:57.360]  If you want to go eat some dead black woman's cancer cells, which are gonna take your ass over, ain't her up in a week.
[02:08:00.950 --> 02:08:01.730]  That's your business.
[02:08:02.271 --> 02:08:03.851]  If you want to commit suicide, you do.
[02:08:04.211 --> 02:08:06.132]  But we're going to have it listed.
[02:08:06.532 --> 02:08:14.896]  So they're hitting us with such a dystopia, something so hellish, something so bad, they believe that we can't even comprehend it.
[02:08:15.076 --> 02:08:18.457]  Because I'm up here telling you stuff that's all true, and I feel like I'm lying.
[02:08:18.838 --> 02:08:20.218]  Because it's so whacked out.
[02:08:20.258 --> 02:08:23.840]  Like, oh, Bill Gates for ten years in Latin America and three years in the U.S.
[02:08:24.100 --> 02:08:29.122]  has released tens of billions of mosquitoes, and they've loaded them with diseases, and it's all true.
[02:08:30.760 --> 02:08:39.648]  Or the CIA director admits they're chemtrailing and spraying aluminum everywhere to kill the soils, and then only Monsanto will have a seed that can live in aluminum.
[02:08:39.888 --> 02:08:43.351]  I mean, we're already so... It's not Martians invading, folks.
[02:08:43.451 --> 02:08:51.978]  It's crazy humans with all this mad technology who think they're a new advanced species who are operating like aliens to get rid of us.
[02:08:53.039 --> 02:08:56.462]  They've got the technology, they've got it all, they're dialed in.
[02:08:56.482 --> 02:09:00.866]  They're like, we're going to let you go to football games and eat pizzas and have a swimming pool.
[02:09:01.186 --> 02:09:02.006]  We're done!
[02:09:02.407 --> 02:09:07.851]  We're not going to just sit around and have a human culture where you go to church or you watch a sunset.
[02:09:08.672 --> 02:09:10.013]  We want life extension.
[02:09:10.293 --> 02:09:11.194]  We want the future.
[02:09:11.434 --> 02:09:16.158]  And we're cutting your resources off and we're using you for body parts and guinea pigs comprende.
[02:09:17.065 --> 02:09:22.907]  And we're going to control your body and put in you what we want, and so the answer is telling you no.
[02:09:24.367 --> 02:09:32.970]  And then the answer is knowing their battle plan, learning about their battle plan, understanding how they operate, and saying no.
[02:09:33.690 --> 02:09:36.270]  And people say, well, they're too powerful, we'll never beat them.
[02:09:36.531 --> 02:09:37.991]  I just told you, I'm about to give you examples.
[02:09:39.972 --> 02:09:54.424]  If you just do the research and say no to animal bug protein and other human genetic cells growing fake meat and find out who's doing it and file a few lawsuits... I mean, look, I'm not a rocket scientist.
[02:09:56.025 --> 02:09:57.006]  I'm a human scientist.
[02:09:58.544 --> 02:10:04.989]  I got a call from a top nurse at Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio in 1996.
[02:10:06.690 --> 02:10:08.572]  And she said there's a secret database.
[02:10:08.952 --> 02:10:14.916]  They take blood from babies at birth and then the government gets it and sells it to corporations to patent your body's DNA.
[02:10:15.277 --> 02:10:18.919]  And later in a few decades, when it comes out, they can do all this stuff for you.
[02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:20.501]  They're going to claim they own your body.
[02:10:21.281 --> 02:10:33.371]  Just those interviews with that woman, she never came on the show, she came with the documents, created lawsuits in Texas and in Minnesota that partially shut it down.
[02:10:33.651 --> 02:10:40.717]  And then last year it rebroke in Illinois and New York and places that indeed it was still happening.
[02:10:40.757 --> 02:10:42.558]  The government's secretly taking blood.
[02:10:42.798 --> 02:10:44.600]  They say it's a blood test to your baby at birth.
[02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:47.242]  No, it's being put in a database to own your DNA.
[02:10:47.342 --> 02:10:48.963]  I'm going to stop.
[02:10:48.983 --> 02:10:49.524]  I'm going to go to break.
[02:10:50.939 --> 02:10:52.841]  I've told you the problems of what they're doing.
[02:10:53.521 --> 02:10:54.762]  Now I'm going to show you the solutions.
[02:10:55.002 --> 02:11:08.573]  And I'm going to show you multiple real-world, news-breaking today, where you simply said, I'm not eating that, I'm not driving that, I'm not doing that, and it failed and you killed it.
[02:11:09.468 --> 02:11:23.011]  But if it ever gets a foothold, and ever gets you to start buying in against the money, and they're gonna use the regulations to shut down all the good stuff, the cows, and the food, and the freedom, and the travel, and the planes, and make you eat this where that's all there is.
[02:11:24.351 --> 02:11:27.252]  These are sick psychotics, but we can beat them.
[02:11:27.632 --> 02:11:28.992]  I'll explain it straight ahead.
[02:11:29.072 --> 02:11:29.672]  Stay with us.
[02:11:30.533 --> 02:11:31.693]  Many botanists die.
[02:11:33.151 --> 02:11:34.252]  Bring us this information.
[02:11:34.732 --> 02:11:38.974]  You can see here the Great Awakening orbiting the Great Reset.
[02:11:39.695 --> 02:11:49.440]  Although the depopulation systems of the Great Reset are not yet fully operational, the Great Reset does have a strong conspiracy network.
[02:11:49.900 --> 02:11:55.783]  It is protected by a satanic shield, which can be disabled by the Great Awakening.
[02:11:56.183 --> 02:12:02.387]  The Great Reset must be deactivated if any victory for humanity is to be accomplished.
[02:12:03.442 --> 02:12:17.487]  Once the Great Awakening deactivates the shield, InfoWars.com forward slash show will cover the truth while Info Warriors fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the Great Reset.
[02:12:17.967 --> 02:12:21.708]  Alex Jones has volunteered to lead the fighter attack.
[02:12:22.049 --> 02:12:27.550]  Get a signed copy of the Great Awakening today at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:12:27.631 --> 02:12:31.532]  Do you want to beat tyranny?
[02:12:33.012 --> 02:12:34.432]  Do you want a pro-human future?
[02:12:35.713 --> 02:12:40.314]  The globalists need you to adopt technologies and systems that destroy you.
[02:12:40.874 --> 02:12:47.176]  And to do that, they've got to cut off the existing systems that are pro-human and force you onto the new systems.
[02:12:47.557 --> 02:12:51.998]  They want you to adapt to being a slave, adapt to being poisoned and destroyed.
[02:12:52.438 --> 02:12:54.659]  We can beat them and we will beat them.
[02:12:55.421 --> 02:13:00.643]  They're cutting off existing technologies, making us go to other technologies that are bridges to nowhere.
[02:13:00.863 --> 02:13:05.824]  They want to make you eat GMO foods that have the so-called vaccines programmed into them.
[02:13:07.044 --> 02:13:19.128]  They want control of your life, but they have not been able to launch these technologies yet, and we have so many examples of people rejecting their program.
[02:13:20.953 --> 02:13:28.179]  But once they get us to begin to accept it, it funds the new infrastructure, and then it's very hard to beat.
[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:36.386]  And you've seen me warn you about what was coming 25, 29, 30 years ago, coming up in April.
[02:13:36.426 --> 02:13:36.926]  I've been on air.
[02:13:37.707 --> 02:13:40.149]  Some of you have been here 29 years.
[02:13:41.570 --> 02:13:41.910]  I know.
[02:13:42.050 --> 02:13:43.792]  Some caller's been calling in for 25.
[02:13:45.994 --> 02:13:48.496]  And everything we told you they would do, they've done.
[02:13:49.818 --> 02:13:55.521]  Now do you want to sit here later and say, oh Alex Jones was right but we've lost the war against tyranny?
[02:13:55.581 --> 02:13:55.741]  No.
[02:13:56.121 --> 02:13:56.761]  Listen to me now.
[02:13:57.662 --> 02:14:01.123]  So they want to make you eat bug protein that's so poisonous with the chitin.
[02:14:01.744 --> 02:14:02.124]  Look it up.
[02:14:02.684 --> 02:14:08.807]  They want to shut down gasoline engines and diesel when they don't even have the raw materials to build the electric cars.
[02:14:09.847 --> 02:14:12.249]  They are selling you on a post-industrial world.
[02:14:14.129 --> 02:14:20.435]   So I just spent 25 minutes, breaking down just some of the horrible, evil things they're doing.
[02:14:20.855 --> 02:14:33.697]  That the synthetic meat is vats of bacteria programmed by cancer viruses to create synthetic meat.
[02:14:35.137 --> 02:14:36.117]  How dangerous is that?
[02:14:36.698 --> 02:14:37.618]  The studies are out there.
[02:14:38.298 --> 02:14:40.178]  Headline last week, major publication.
[02:14:41.718 --> 02:14:44.319]  Synthetic meat, toxic, full of poisonous bacteria.
[02:14:46.294 --> 02:14:55.960]  But because they can't sell the adults, they're selling the children, and they're putting the bug protein under other names as the batter on the fried chicken and more.
[02:14:56.781 --> 02:15:12.111]  But here's a couple of examples, breaking this week, of the total human rejection of their system, which is a example, a success story, of how we can do this on every front.
[02:15:12.591 --> 02:15:13.432]  Look at this headline.
[02:15:15.137 --> 02:15:22.062]  The latest sign from townhall.com, the latest sign that consumers just don't want electric vehicles.
[02:15:22.903 --> 02:15:26.585]  And it goes into Hertz getting rid of their electric car fleet.
[02:15:27.746 --> 02:15:29.788]  Because no one's renting them.
[02:15:31.738 --> 02:15:33.119]  It's not that electric cars are bad.
[02:15:33.459 --> 02:15:39.403]  It's that the innovation is meant to get rid of the existing cars and then phase out cars altogether.
[02:15:39.704 --> 02:15:41.185]  Klaus Schwab has said.
[02:15:41.405 --> 02:15:43.987]  They're suppressing all the new real technologies.
[02:15:44.207 --> 02:15:45.148]  And it's not just Hertz.
[02:15:45.308 --> 02:15:50.832]  It's all of them are either getting rid of their electric fleets or cutting them by 80 to 90 percent.
[02:15:51.192 --> 02:15:53.433]  Go read the article for yourself.
[02:15:54.314 --> 02:15:54.814]  Here's more.
[02:15:55.955 --> 02:15:58.497]  Self-checkout is a failed experiment.
[02:15:58.817 --> 02:15:59.578]  The Atlantic.
[02:16:00.894 --> 02:16:07.797]  The Atlantic is basically the mouthpiece of the Mossad, CIA, MI6, New World Order.
[02:16:08.577 --> 02:16:13.159]  Even they are admitting that.
[02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:15.840]  The owner is Steve Jobs' widow.
[02:16:17.101 --> 02:16:19.062]  She's at Epstein Island even more than Bill Clinton.
[02:16:19.727 --> 02:16:20.747]  Why is she saying that?
[02:16:21.528 --> 02:16:27.030]  Well, because once we beat them on a subject, they'll sit up there and report on it like they're the ones that are in charge.
[02:16:27.090 --> 02:16:28.371]  No, they tried all this.
[02:16:28.391 --> 02:16:28.891]  Here's the deal.
[02:16:29.492 --> 02:16:30.752]  You're like, well, we don't need humans.
[02:16:30.952 --> 02:16:32.113]  We'll do a self-checkout.
[02:16:34.894 --> 02:16:35.614]  We don't need humans.
[02:16:35.634 --> 02:16:36.595]  We'll just order from Amazon.
[02:16:37.195 --> 02:16:41.217]  But all of that removes humans from jobs and makes us obsolete.
[02:16:41.477 --> 02:16:50.468]   So there's just billions of us sitting around Watching TV, playing video games, being brainwashed, which is what Klaus Schwab and Navalno or Harari and...
[02:16:52.674 --> 02:16:55.735]  Ray Kurzweil have all said for decades, we're going to make you obsolete.
[02:16:55.995 --> 02:16:58.695]  You're only obsolete if you decide to be obsolete.
[02:16:59.075 --> 02:17:00.996]  You're not weakened by cleaning the garage.
[02:17:01.216 --> 02:17:03.016]  You're not weakened by cooking dinner for your family.
[02:17:03.196 --> 02:17:04.617]  You're not weakened by growing a garden.
[02:17:04.817 --> 02:17:06.277]  You're not weakened by hiking up a mountain.
[02:17:06.477 --> 02:17:07.697]  You're not weakened by lifting weights.
[02:17:07.917 --> 02:17:09.658]  You're not weakened by going to a protest.
[02:17:09.858 --> 02:17:13.739]  You're not weakened by starting a new business or working 18 hours a day to get it launched.
[02:17:14.019 --> 02:17:15.419]  You are strengthened!
[02:17:18.007 --> 02:17:25.809]  And we're seeing a rejection of Hollywood and the corporate media and suddenly screen time for the first time in decades is going down as people rediscover the outdoors.
[02:17:28.250 --> 02:17:32.371]  Why several big box stores have ditched their self-checkouts completely.
[02:17:33.251 --> 02:17:40.574]  CBC, Walmart's getting rid of them all over the place because people don't use them, period.
[02:17:41.774 --> 02:17:50.629]   Because they want to talk to a human, because they fundamentally get That there's an exchange of money and goods with a human because the system's built by us.
[02:17:50.949 --> 02:17:52.771]  We're told the age of humans is over.
[02:17:53.111 --> 02:17:54.172]  The future's not human.
[02:17:54.452 --> 02:17:55.393]  Buy the WEF.
[02:17:55.493 --> 02:17:56.293]  Buy Klaus Schwab.
[02:17:56.354 --> 02:17:56.954]  Buy Bill Gates.
[02:17:57.214 --> 02:18:00.737]  But it's only over if we accept it's over.
[02:18:02.759 --> 02:18:04.720]  It's only just begun.
[02:18:07.042 --> 02:18:10.265]  Self-checkout reversal is growing, CNN.
[02:18:12.847 --> 02:18:14.028]  Why self-checkouts?
[02:18:14.188 --> 02:18:15.189]  Maybe on the way out.
[02:18:18.539 --> 02:18:22.200]  NBC, Walmart said to remove self-checkout.
[02:18:24.681 --> 02:18:26.501]  Grocery stores giving up on self-checkout.
[02:18:28.602 --> 02:18:29.682]  Is self-checkout worth it?
[02:18:32.603 --> 02:18:33.843]  And you're like, well, that's just self-checkout.
[02:18:33.863 --> 02:18:34.283]  No.
[02:18:34.983 --> 02:18:45.686]  Even if self-checkout wasn't an evil thing deployed by them on purpose to remove humans from the equation, to have robots that follow orders, it's an example of our power, but it's one of the keystones.
[02:18:46.907 --> 02:18:50.391]   It's one of the Absolute heart of their operation.
[02:18:50.611 --> 02:18:52.673]  That's why they're sabotaging the military.
[02:18:52.973 --> 02:18:55.054]  They want to make it all drones and robots because they'll follow orders.
[02:18:56.175 --> 02:19:00.497]  This is an admitted plan, and we have it, and we know it.
[02:19:01.478 --> 02:19:07.862]  So what are they going to do when we don't want bug protein, or sewage water in our tap water, or self-checkout lanes?
[02:19:08.202 --> 02:19:09.743]  They're going to try to camouflage it.
[02:19:11.544 --> 02:19:21.856]   In England, in Germany, in New York, in the US, they have robots that look like What were the name of the robots in Doctor Who that go around saying exterminate, exterminate humans?
[02:19:22.476 --> 02:19:22.916]  Dreadles?
[02:19:23.456 --> 02:19:26.037]  Maybe pull up a clip of Doctor Who Extermination Robot.
[02:19:26.057 --> 02:19:26.958]  I think it's called a Dreadle.
[02:19:29.279 --> 02:19:29.419]  What?
[02:19:33.250 --> 02:19:42.155]  They're telling you what they're doing and they literally are the Daleks or the Daleks or just type in Doctor Who extermination robot.
[02:19:42.716 --> 02:19:46.558]  Since the 70s or 60s they've had like 10 different productions of it or more.
[02:19:46.938 --> 02:19:52.381]  It's always the same and now they've actually created these actual things going around shouting at you.
[02:19:53.321 --> 02:19:59.046]  It's a ruling corrupt establishment that doesn't want you to have a future that says they want to get rid of you.
[02:19:59.346 --> 02:20:02.028]  How about we just decide we don't support you?
[02:20:03.129 --> 02:20:03.549]  Daleks.
[02:20:03.689 --> 02:20:04.069]  Daleks.
[02:20:04.089 --> 02:20:04.650]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[02:20:05.030 --> 02:20:05.971]  I'm script-free here, folks.
[02:20:06.031 --> 02:20:06.651]  I'm going off memory.
[02:20:07.412 --> 02:20:07.772]  Daleks.
[02:20:08.112 --> 02:20:08.733]  Exterminate.
[02:20:09.413 --> 02:20:11.054]  So type in Dr. Who's Daleks.
[02:20:13.156 --> 02:20:13.716]  We'll skip the break.
[02:20:13.736 --> 02:20:14.337]  We'll play that in a minute.
[02:20:16.667 --> 02:20:27.054]  You have these inbred global elitists, six, seven generations, haven't even worked, and they see all these people and these masses, and they say, well, they're eating our food, they're our resources, we don't want to see them!
[02:20:27.635 --> 02:20:52.788]   And do we just accept, yeah, we're ugly and bad, we're bad to the earth, trees are bad, cows are bad, let's get rid of them all, we'll do whatever you say, and as you shut down the global economy, as you cut off the fuel, as you cut off the infrastructure, as you, as you cut off The fertilizer, thank you, William Shatner, saying, oh, the global extinction is here.
[02:20:53.529 --> 02:20:58.931]  And AOC, and Beto O'Rourke, and Al Gore, and Bill Gates, and all of them.
[02:20:59.552 --> 02:21:01.413]  And the examples are everywhere.
[02:21:02.393 --> 02:21:06.775]  We simply have to reject them.
[02:21:07.876 --> 02:21:13.339]  We have to say no to telling little white kids, you're racist because you're five-year-old and white.
[02:21:14.363 --> 02:21:15.344]  It's so easy to reject that.
[02:21:15.384 --> 02:21:16.425]  It's so evil on its face.
[02:21:16.685 --> 02:21:22.569]  The black people are like the main group of the city councils and the school board saying, you don't tell white kids they're evil?
[02:21:24.311 --> 02:21:26.132]  Because they know that's inherently racist.
[02:21:26.152 --> 02:21:27.053]  That's crazy.
[02:21:27.713 --> 02:21:29.855]  Sure, Black Lives Matter can hire some black people.
[02:21:30.115 --> 02:21:34.138]  George Soros give them 20 million a piece to go out and spout that because they want us killing each other.
[02:21:34.778 --> 02:21:36.119]  All we got to do is reject it.
[02:21:38.942 --> 02:21:40.923]  We know how to beat the enemy, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:21:41.824 --> 02:21:53.176]   And We see the examples of nobody wanting the electric cars, and nobody wanting the synthetic meat, and nobody wanting the self-checkout crap.
[02:21:54.318 --> 02:21:55.940]  I mean, it's gone on for decades.
[02:21:56.300 --> 02:21:57.702]  I've been covering this 25 years at least.
[02:21:58.223 --> 02:22:00.747]  You go to the store, there's two checkout lanes on a Sunday morning.
[02:22:01.761 --> 02:22:09.024]  And there's two checkout lanes with humans and 20 checkout lanes with robots, and everybody's lined up for a human.
[02:22:09.044 --> 02:22:13.566]  Because you're coming to spend your money, you want to give it to a human because you're a pro-human.
[02:22:13.946 --> 02:22:17.387]  Because you know, it's archetypal, but it's on our cells.
[02:22:17.968 --> 02:22:28.672]  Giving the money, even though they're not even getting it, to the lady or the man or the girl behind the counter, you're exchanging with a human and you know it goes back in your human system.
[02:22:29.132 --> 02:22:31.213]  But you inherently know at a genetic level.
[02:22:32.165 --> 02:22:35.390]  That a robot, I don't know this.
[02:22:37.293 --> 02:22:38.695]  And you've got to go with your instincts.
[02:22:38.715 --> 02:22:39.937]  You've got to go with your humanity.
[02:22:40.437 --> 02:22:41.779]  You've got to go with who you are.
[02:22:43.322 --> 02:22:45.445]  You've got to reject everything they're selling.
[02:22:45.745 --> 02:22:47.047]  And there's so many other examples.
[02:22:48.254 --> 02:22:50.575]  The NRA's been a weak lobby for us, but at least it was there.
[02:22:50.916 --> 02:22:53.257]  But now, the liberals are all out buying guns.
[02:22:53.317 --> 02:22:54.177]  I go to gun shops.
[02:22:54.598 --> 02:22:57.919]  I go shooting at shooting ranges and they say, our biggest customers are liberals.
[02:22:58.380 --> 02:23:00.821]  And first they say, we're buying guns, we're scared of Trump.
[02:23:01.561 --> 02:23:10.126]  Then they start to wake up in the culture and they go, well I shot a gun, it protected me and makes me feel good at home and I saw the statistics and I was wrong, I don't want to fight people here.
[02:23:11.107 --> 02:23:12.348]  And suddenly they're on your side.
[02:23:12.768 --> 02:23:14.569]  Suddenly they're shooting a gun with you at the shooting range.
[02:23:16.383 --> 02:23:18.604]  Instead of hating them, I love what Vivek Ramaswamy's been doing.
[02:23:19.224 --> 02:23:23.385]  I never played the clip, but I saw him this week, where they'll jump up and try to interrupt his talk.
[02:23:23.405 --> 02:23:25.085]  He says, come on up here, tell me what you want to say.
[02:23:27.226 --> 02:23:31.147]  And just because they're included, he has them eating out of his hand in five minutes.
[02:23:32.407 --> 02:23:42.290]  We're selling prosperity and a human future and freedom versus a Bill Gates dystopia.
[02:23:42.410 --> 02:23:45.051]  It should be so easy to defeat these people.
[02:23:44.890 --> 02:23:46.890]  Here's a clip from Dr. Hood.
[02:23:46.890 --> 02:23:51.890]  I shall speak only to the doctor.
[02:23:51.890 --> 02:23:58.890]  You're gonna get rusty.
[02:23:59.058 --> 02:24:04.262]  I bit off the DNA of Rose Tyler.
[02:24:05.042 --> 02:24:12.407]  Extrapolating the biomass of a time traveller regenerated me.
[02:24:12.827 --> 02:24:13.688]  What's your next trick?
[02:24:14.729 --> 02:24:18.191]  I have been searching for the Daleks.
[02:24:18.891 --> 02:24:19.792]  Yeah, I saw.
[02:24:20.853 --> 02:24:21.953]  Downloading the internet.
[02:24:22.012 --> 02:24:23.052]  What did you find?
[02:24:23.052 --> 02:24:28.052]  I scanned your satellites and radio telescopes.
[02:24:28.052 --> 02:24:29.052]  And?
[02:24:30.041 --> 02:24:30.801]  Nothing!
[02:24:30.821 --> 02:24:35.004]  WHERE SHALL I GET MY ORDERS NOW?
[02:24:35.385 --> 02:24:36.906]  You're just a soldier without commands.
[02:24:37.586 --> 02:24:45.592]  THEN I SHALL FOLLOW THE PRIMARY ORDER, THE DARLEK INSTINCTS TO DESTROY, TO CONQUER!
[02:24:45.812 --> 02:24:46.373]  What for?
[02:24:46.673 --> 02:24:47.333]  What's the point?
[02:24:50.996 --> 02:24:51.436]  Don't you see?
[02:24:51.456 --> 02:24:51.997]  It's all gone.
[02:24:52.796 --> 02:24:54.796]  Everything you were, everything you stood for.
[02:24:54.796 --> 02:24:59.796]  And what should I do?
[02:24:59.796 --> 02:25:02.796]  You know, this is very pointless.
[02:25:03.217 --> 02:25:03.978]  Let's stop right there.
[02:25:03.998 --> 02:25:10.065]  I asked him out of a 40-year shelf, 50-year-long show, find me the Daleks.
[02:25:11.506 --> 02:25:14.149]  They go around under globalist orders to exterminate humans.
[02:25:15.651 --> 02:25:19.555]  Now, the whole world's destroyed, I guess, in this episode, and the Dalek doesn't get it.
[02:25:21.730 --> 02:25:23.851]  So, that's kind of what I ask the globalists.
[02:25:24.091 --> 02:25:26.032]  I mean, there's 8 million people.
[02:25:26.132 --> 02:25:29.193]  You can argue there's too many of us, we got problems, nobody can deny there's some issues.
[02:25:29.913 --> 02:25:36.856]  But do you then just say, let's sabotage civilization and implode it, and get rid of people, and somehow that's going to make it better?
[02:25:38.176 --> 02:25:39.036]  And where do you stop?
[02:25:41.497 --> 02:25:43.358]  Go back to the 70s classic.
[02:25:43.438 --> 02:25:45.599]  Type in classic Doctor Who doll.
[02:25:48.387 --> 02:25:52.868]  Because I'm not a big Doctor Who guy, but I would watch it on PBS when I was like 10 years old.
[02:25:54.909 --> 02:25:56.389]  There's the actor, looks like he's on heroin.
[02:25:57.089 --> 02:26:01.990]  And everywhere he goes, he's got a Dalek chasing him.
[02:26:04.791 --> 02:26:06.772]  Yeah, that's the guy.
[02:26:06.792 --> 02:26:07.392]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:26:07.752 --> 02:26:11.573]  Do you have any inkling of the theory of space dimension correlated to relative time?
[02:26:15.725 --> 02:26:21.207]  Davros wishes all members of the elite scientific corps to assemble in the main laboratory immediately.
[02:26:21.627 --> 02:26:22.808]  Our session will have to wait.
[02:26:23.448 --> 02:26:24.248]  Davros is coming.
[02:26:24.408 --> 02:26:25.489]  Your chief scientist.
[02:26:25.549 --> 02:26:26.969]  He is our supreme commander.
[02:26:27.790 --> 02:26:31.591]  When he calls a full meeting like this, he obviously has something of the greatest importance to tell us.
[02:26:31.771 --> 02:26:33.152]  Well, I shall be delighted to meet him.
[02:26:33.011 --> 02:26:36.011]  Stand up and keep quiet.
[02:26:36.011 --> 02:26:46.011]  I thought they had no attention.
[02:26:46.011 --> 02:26:48.030]  (upbeat music)
[02:26:48.165 --> 02:26:52.369]  For some time, I have been experimenting with the Mark III project.
[02:26:53.430 --> 02:27:02.778]  Details and modifications will be distributed later, however, I am anxious that you should see, immediately, the remarkable results that I have achieved.
[02:27:03.918 --> 02:27:08.918]  And to that end, I have arranged this demonstration.
[02:27:08.918 --> 02:27:23.918]  Dalek.
[02:27:23.918 --> 02:27:25.918]  Dalek.
[02:27:26.141 --> 02:27:28.123]  A primitive, but undeniably a Dalek.
[02:27:28.223 --> 02:27:28.823]  You're mistaken.
[02:27:29.464 --> 02:27:31.005]  It's a Mark III travel machine.
[02:27:32.365 --> 02:27:32.966]  You say so.
[02:27:33.466 --> 02:27:33.786]  Halt.
[02:27:35.267 --> 02:27:36.969]  Turn left, move forward.
[02:27:38.089 --> 02:27:39.170]  That's magnificent.
[02:27:39.851 --> 02:27:41.132]  He's perfected voice control.
[02:27:42.112 --> 02:27:42.853]  Turn right.
[02:27:45.194 --> 02:27:47.056]  Move forward and circle left.
[02:27:49.156 --> 02:27:53.795]   You will agree, I think, that voice control represents an enormous step forward.
[02:27:53.795 --> 02:27:58.116]  However, the best is yet to come.
[02:27:58.116 --> 02:27:58.995]  Neither.
[02:27:58.995 --> 02:28:20.436]  [Music]
[02:28:20.436 --> 02:28:23.956]  Our machine is now equipped with a weapon for self-defense.
[02:28:24.031 --> 02:28:30.215]  Now, I am going to turn the machine over to total self-control.
[02:28:30.395 --> 02:28:34.357]  It will be entirely independent of all outside influences.
[02:28:34.756 --> 02:28:40.756]  A living, thinking, self-supporting creature.
[02:28:40.756 --> 02:28:49.756]  Exterminate!
[02:28:49.974 --> 02:28:51.255]  Oh, this is the birth of the Daleks.
[02:28:51.896 --> 02:28:54.299]  So the AI ruling class... Brilliant.
[02:28:54.680 --> 02:28:56.882]  It has detected the non-conformity.
[02:28:57.123 --> 02:28:58.324]  Indians!
[02:28:58.885 --> 02:29:00.227]  I must exterminate!
[02:29:00.387 --> 02:29:01.308]  Exterminate!
[02:29:02.189 --> 02:29:02.369]  No!
[02:29:03.689 --> 02:29:05.390]  Wow, so they found the perfect episode.
[02:29:05.410 --> 02:29:06.271]  Randomly.
[02:29:06.331 --> 02:29:07.751]  You dare to interfere?
[02:29:08.392 --> 02:29:10.273]  You have the audacity to interrupt?
[02:29:10.353 --> 02:29:14.115]  So you got this cyborg globalist of the scientific elite.
[02:29:14.255 --> 02:29:18.098]  The first thing it wants is an extermination system.
[02:29:18.558 --> 02:29:25.122]  My creature showed a natural desire, an instinct to destroy, and you interceded!
[02:29:25.462 --> 02:29:27.263]  You will be punished for this!
[02:29:28.244 --> 02:29:29.044]  Davros, I'm sorry.
[02:29:30.441 --> 02:29:33.607]  But I believe that these prisoners, they... they could be extremely valuable.
[02:29:34.609 --> 02:29:40.099]  By all means, when I finish my questions, let the machine do what it likes with them, but... but I do need to interrogate them further!
[02:29:41.271 --> 02:29:43.372]  You will be punished for insubordination!
[02:29:44.072 --> 02:29:46.774]  In the meantime, you may question the prisoners.
[02:29:47.374 --> 02:29:48.334]  Alright, that's enough.
[02:29:48.734 --> 02:29:56.498]  The point is, is they run around in this universe, this is like an MI6 program, murdering humans because that's the answer to the world.
[02:29:56.858 --> 02:30:05.162]  And that's all this is, and that's the AI, and that's what it is, and it's programmed by this cyborg demon that wants to get rid of people, and that's it.
[02:30:06.943 --> 02:30:08.844]  So just reject it, people.
[02:30:09.938 --> 02:30:10.678]  Rejected.
[02:30:11.279 --> 02:30:13.139]  They are threatened by the technology.
[02:30:13.419 --> 02:30:14.740]  They are threatened by the freedom.
[02:30:14.760 --> 02:30:18.741]  They're threatened by it destroying their Ponzi scheme.
[02:30:19.261 --> 02:30:20.342]  I mean, you look at the big banks.
[02:30:20.402 --> 02:30:25.404]  It's all just a bunch of Bernie Madoff, Sam Bateman Freeds type scammers.
[02:30:26.604 --> 02:30:31.106]  And they want to use the defense system of war against us.
[02:30:31.286 --> 02:30:33.046]  And they're openly stealing elections.
[02:30:33.366 --> 02:30:35.367]  They're openly taking candidates off the ballot.
[02:30:35.787 --> 02:30:36.928]  They are crazy.
[02:30:37.958 --> 02:30:41.360]  Why on earth would anybody let these people run anything?
[02:30:41.700 --> 02:30:42.800]  I'm not trying to run anything.
[02:30:43.801 --> 02:30:45.121]  I'm not trying to be the boss.
[02:30:45.262 --> 02:30:46.162]  I don't want to be in charge.
[02:30:47.062 --> 02:31:02.310]  I want to have a system of open free market debate and competition where it creates incredible success and through our own will and our own actions we decide what we want, which I just said, rejecting the electric cars because they're a bridge to nowhere.
[02:31:02.930 --> 02:31:04.370]  Rejecting the synthetic meat.
[02:31:04.711 --> 02:31:06.231]  Rejecting the self-checkout lanes.
[02:31:06.531 --> 02:31:07.911]  Rejecting the poison shots.
[02:31:08.292 --> 02:31:09.512]  Rejecting the open borders.
[02:31:09.852 --> 02:31:10.972]  Rejecting war.
[02:31:11.252 --> 02:31:12.553]  Rejecting the New World Order.
[02:31:12.693 --> 02:31:13.553]  Let's do it!
[02:31:15.114 --> 02:31:30.218]  But you've got all these lazy people, born into the system with all their worthless college degrees, and they're told, if you go along with the New World Order, you'll be given a position of power in the system.
[02:31:31.291 --> 02:31:32.752]  We know historically that never happens.
[02:31:34.194 --> 02:31:34.914]  So that's where we are.
[02:31:37.497 --> 02:31:38.538]  I mean, just look at this right here.
[02:31:41.180 --> 02:31:50.489]  Revealed, half of World Health Organization's transgender health committee members have no medical background and the majority are activists.
[02:31:52.151 --> 02:31:54.072]  You know why I've never known Joe Rogan or Spotify?
[02:31:55.163 --> 02:32:03.807]  Not the engineers in Sweden, but the people that run it are in New York, and something like 90% at the headquarters in New York are transgender.
[02:32:04.127 --> 02:32:13.971]  They're men who say they're women, and because they're not being quote accepted, they were perfectly chosen in the cult, they are now saying we're gonna censor everybody.
[02:32:16.372 --> 02:32:26.157]   And half the World Health Organization's leaders pushing this cult on everybody, Are men that say they're women?
[02:32:28.798 --> 02:32:30.299]  They're going against the biology.
[02:32:30.559 --> 02:32:31.679]  They're going against the code.
[02:32:31.899 --> 02:32:33.279]  And you can like, okay, do your own thing.
[02:32:33.319 --> 02:32:34.140]  We're laissez-faire.
[02:32:34.160 --> 02:32:34.600]  We're free.
[02:32:34.940 --> 02:32:35.100]  No.
[02:32:35.320 --> 02:32:39.101]  They want to make us conform to their model.
[02:32:39.921 --> 02:32:43.102]  And they've set themselves up as a man that's a woman.
[02:32:43.542 --> 02:32:46.023]  A hermaphrodite that rules us.
[02:32:48.524 --> 02:32:48.964]  Look at this.
[02:32:48.984 --> 02:32:49.764]  It's a huge article.
[02:32:50.084 --> 02:32:50.584]  Look at this one.
[02:32:51.344 --> 02:32:51.804]  Revealed.
[02:32:51.904 --> 02:32:58.526]   Half of the WHO's transgender Health committee members have no medical background and are activists.
[02:32:58.586 --> 02:32:59.527]  And who are the new generals?
[02:32:59.827 --> 02:33:00.748]  And who are the new admirals?
[02:33:00.888 --> 02:33:01.708]  These people.
[02:33:02.529 --> 02:33:03.990]  They're not engineers.
[02:33:04.311 --> 02:33:07.593]  They don't know how stuff works, but they've given up their humanity.
[02:33:07.873 --> 02:33:09.495]  They've said, I'm not having children.
[02:33:12.998 --> 02:33:16.961]  And so they put, oh, the liberals put women in charge.
[02:33:17.581 --> 02:33:18.602]  And they go, exactly.
[02:33:19.143 --> 02:33:20.203]  Men that say they're women.
[02:33:22.445 --> 02:33:27.138]   And for those that aren't the transgenders, Which is a cult at the corporate level.
[02:33:27.398 --> 02:33:47.054]  You don't get in their group unless you're fully submitted to this and unless as a sacrament like the Hillbop Heaven's Gate cult made them all cut their genitals off and then drink vodka and barbiturates and kill themselves so they can be teleported up to the comet and go be gods.
[02:33:48.896 --> 02:33:50.917]  My hands are blue because I got a new pair of jeans.
[02:33:51.843 --> 02:33:53.664]  And I guess I'm rubbing my hands on my jeans.
[02:33:54.224 --> 02:33:55.145]  I'm like a Smurf now.
[02:33:56.125 --> 02:33:58.446]  But that's where we are.
[02:33:59.467 --> 02:34:01.327]  And that's what's going on.
[02:34:01.186 --> 02:34:14.066]   that's what's happening here. And all we have to do is reject it.
[02:34:12.353 --> 02:34:12.773]  Look at this.
[02:34:13.993 --> 02:34:21.527]   John Hopkins, DEI, Don't worry, she's a black lady, so we've got to do whatever she says.
[02:34:21.346 --> 02:34:26.707]   labeling "abled body" so if you can walk and talk you're racist.
[02:34:26.707 --> 02:34:29.467]  Christians and English speakers as privileged.
[02:34:29.467 --> 02:34:32.666]  Infowars.com, a Don Salazar article.
[02:34:32.666 --> 02:34:36.226]   But don't worry, she's a black lady so we've got to do whatever she says.
[02:34:36.226 --> 02:34:38.865]  Or we're racist.
[02:34:38.865 --> 02:34:41.025]  And Milan must said this must end.
[02:34:41.552 --> 02:34:46.833]  And there's a big report out about the fact that competency is destroying civilization.
[02:34:47.154 --> 02:34:48.114]  Planes are crashing.
[02:34:48.434 --> 02:34:49.794]  Nuclear reactors are melting down.
[02:34:50.114 --> 02:34:50.795]  But it's okay.
[02:34:51.095 --> 02:34:59.797]  The chief diversity officer says being healthy is bad, being white is bad, and even if you're a female that's white, you're bad.
[02:35:00.358 --> 02:35:01.558]  She says white people.
[02:35:01.938 --> 02:35:02.998]  Here's a list she put out.
[02:35:03.478 --> 02:35:04.539]  Able-bodied people.
[02:35:05.509 --> 02:35:14.124]  Heterosexuals, cisgender people, males, Christians, middle or owning class people, if you own anything, middle-aged people, English-speaking people.
[02:35:15.707 --> 02:35:25.927]   While they cut off the infrastructure, then they tell the poor people, "Well, just give
[02:35:25.927 --> 02:35:28.767]  up your sex, give up your family, give up your..."
[02:35:28.767 --> 02:35:30.007]  What's Black Lives Matter say?
[02:35:30.012 --> 02:35:50.070]  Their main mission is making black men transgender, so they never have... It's so obvious, it's so admitted, it's confirmed, it's not debated, that the corporate evil eugenics mad scientists have cloaked themselves in not just women, but their skin as a black woman, like the Harvard head.
[02:35:53.715 --> 02:35:55.455]  We must reject it all, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:56.596 --> 02:35:57.356]  We're going to go to break.
[02:35:57.616 --> 02:35:58.476]  Jay Dyer's coming up.

[02:36:21.193 --> 02:36:23.033]  is lack of vitamin D3.
[02:36:23.033 --> 02:36:31.073]   We've got the best right now at Infowarsstore.com and so many other great products at Infowarsstore.com

[02:37:44.816 --> 02:37:51.661]  Welcome to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:37:51.681 --> 02:38:25.533]   I'm your guest host Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis and I was listening intently to Alex as he covered the attack vector of our diet and really ultimately our whole culture via the WEF, Davos and the entire international elite clique and what their plans are Especially when it comes to these really fundamental human ways of being and then how they want to invert that, turn it into something abnormal, unnatural, and essentially anti-human and anti-natalist.
[02:38:26.533 --> 02:38:33.857]  There's nobody better to talk about these topics with than my good buddy Tristan Haggard of PrimalEdgeHealth.com.
[02:38:34.477 --> 02:38:35.797]  Tristan is a YouTuber.
[02:38:36.478 --> 02:38:41.808]   I would say he's a Experienced homesteader and Tristan joins us to talk about
[02:38:42.461 --> 02:38:44.561]  This whole plan, he's covered it for many years.
[02:38:44.621 --> 02:38:50.262]  In fact, he actually woke me up to a lot of stuff as it pertains to the vegan agenda, the diet agenda.
[02:38:50.802 --> 02:39:01.544]  But before we get into all that, I want to talk about this recent Obama-produced Netflix movie, Leave the World Behind, because he and I did a big breakdown of that on our YouTube channel.
[02:39:01.564 --> 02:39:31.453]   And that's relevant because I think that if we look at the predictive programming that we see in a lot of the propaganda films, and we've got, of course, this Alex Garland movie coming out, Civil war which also has the same themes it looks like as It ties into I think a lot of the world economic forms plans for a great reset It looks like they really want to prep us for some potential event the Internet's talking about the big event Paul Paul Joseph Watson made a video about the coming event and they're building Bunkers like Zuckerberg Zucker bunker or whatever.
[02:39:31.854 --> 02:39:44.308]   So what I want to talk to Tristan about is what he thinks is The predictive programming elements are in Leave the World Behind and what they are and then how that might tie into the WEF Davos agenda.
[02:39:44.328 --> 02:39:46.009]  Davos is meeting, I think, in the next week.
[02:39:46.089 --> 02:39:48.030]  So how does this all tie together, Tristan?
[02:39:48.050 --> 02:39:49.311]  What did you think about Leave the World Behind?
[02:39:50.535 --> 02:39:52.257]  Yeah, thanks a lot for having me on, Jay.
[02:39:52.797 --> 02:40:01.745]  It's amazing that Obama actually produced this film, which was, I think you and I both agreed that it was an awful movie in every single way.
[02:40:02.106 --> 02:40:06.069]  But the predictive programming elements of this were just blatant and so in your face.
[02:40:06.129 --> 02:40:23.946]   And one of the things that I think really ties in with the subject at hand, Concerning food, the food supply and our health is the chronic wasting disease that was kind of alluded to throughout the film with the deer and nature itself becoming almost weaponized in this kind of creepy, somewhat
[02:40:24.546 --> 02:40:46.506]  Cliché horror film trope that they had going throughout the film, where the deer actually would surround the characters in this film at one point, and the deer are looking a little bit raggedy, they're looking a little scraggly, their hair seems to be falling out a bit, and they're not afraid of people, which is one of the symptoms of chronic wasting disease that we're seeing rampant throughout the United States.
[02:40:47.006 --> 02:41:04.552]  And I find this so coincidental, so strange that they are highlighting this specific issue, especially considering what we've seen with the attack on our food supply through the attempted taxations on meat, the attempted reduction in meat production.
[02:41:05.252 --> 02:41:20.045]  Uh, and the, the intended shift to this lab grown meat, which is Alex reminded us earlier, this is the, the technology used to grow this stuff in the laboratory is basically they are weaponizing essentially cancer type processes.
[02:41:20.495 --> 02:41:25.321]  Where there's aberrant cell reproduction in this so-called lab-grown me.
[02:41:26.342 --> 02:41:35.092]  So it's basically, you know, they're programming us with this eat-the-bugs-bigot mentality that they've been telling us about for so long and we've been memeing it on the internet for years.
[02:41:35.472 --> 02:41:39.257]  But it's not just eat-the-bugs-bigot, it's eat-the-tumors-bigot.
[02:41:41.784 --> 02:41:47.091]  Yeah, I mean, you've highlighted this for a long time about how they really intentionally want to feed us kibble.
[02:41:47.111 --> 02:41:50.856]  This goes back to Plato's way of social engineering in the Republic.
[02:41:50.896 --> 02:41:55.262]  He talks about how the plebs have to eat grain and things that would make them docile.
[02:41:55.823 --> 02:41:59.188]  They would really remove their virility, their ability to fight back.
[02:41:59.888 --> 02:42:14.974]  When they're socially engineered and controlled, and then you fast forward all the way up to the 1970s, you have Alvin Toffler, people like that, Global Elite's talking about how we need to tie alternative lifestyles to alternative movements and alternative diets.
[02:42:15.034 --> 02:42:23.137]  So he says, maybe in the future we'll have an anarcho-alternative, polycule, vegetarian movement that will arise.
[02:42:23.177 --> 02:42:30.679]   And this will be not just an alternative way to live, But also an alternative way to eat that's more in tune with nature and Gaia and all of that.
[02:42:31.320 --> 02:42:33.460]  This is an absolute 100% plan.
[02:42:33.540 --> 02:42:38.222]  And when we come back, I want to talk to Tristan about the antinatalist agenda, how this ties into it.
[02:42:38.242 --> 02:42:39.382]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:42:39.742 --> 02:42:41.323]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer with Tristan Haggard.
[02:42:41.343 --> 02:42:41.963]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:42:42.423 --> 02:42:43.303]  Stay right there.
[02:42:43.744 --> 02:42:45.144]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:42:45.164 --> 02:42:47.125]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[02:42:47.345 --> 02:42:48.405]  You can find me on YouTube.
[02:42:48.445 --> 02:42:49.365]  You can find me on Rockfin.
[02:42:49.385 --> 02:42:51.146]  You can find me on my website, jaysandalsos.com.
[02:42:52.353 --> 02:42:54.915]  I'm here with my good buddy Tristan Haggard of Primal Edge Health.
[02:42:55.115 --> 02:42:56.777]  You can also find him at his website.
[02:42:56.797 --> 02:42:58.958]  He has a carnivore cookbook there.
[02:42:59.559 --> 02:43:06.284]  Tristan, I know this is like a very basic question, but why do they really want to go so hard after meat?
[02:43:07.205 --> 02:43:08.346]  What's a big deal?
[02:43:08.386 --> 02:43:10.628]  Maybe, shouldn't we be eating a bunch of vegetables anyway?
[02:43:10.688 --> 02:43:11.869]  Isn't that more healthy?
[02:43:12.329 --> 02:43:21.777]  Why does the World Economic Forum, all the global elite, and then their pop star front-piece shills, why do they all tell us we need to be vegans and stop eating meat?
[02:43:23.638 --> 02:43:29.101]  Yeah, well, I mean, it's really interesting when you look at historically who produces meat, who produces animal foods.
[02:43:29.421 --> 02:43:30.522]  It's always rural people.
[02:43:30.902 --> 02:43:33.363]  It's always people that live outside of the big cities.
[02:43:33.463 --> 02:43:37.826]  It's always, until very recently, it's been small family farms, right?
[02:43:37.866 --> 02:43:52.494]  Now with the industrial food production model that's kind of taken over, which was bankrolled by big foundations and NGOs, the Rockefeller Foundation specifically, helped to catapult the green revolution upon us, which then led to the gene revolution.
[02:43:52.654 --> 02:43:56.537]  And the genetic modification of foods like corn, wheat and soy.
[02:43:56.557 --> 02:44:05.923]  I mean, the economic incentive is, of course, that when you look at what foods they want us to eat, what are the insects that they want us to eat?
[02:44:06.664 --> 02:44:07.345]  What are they fed?
[02:44:07.705 --> 02:44:09.086]  Well, they're fed GMO corn.
[02:44:09.206 --> 02:44:10.587]  They're fed GMO soy.
[02:44:11.147 --> 02:44:17.431]  So what is the tofu and the soy-based meat products?
[02:44:17.471 --> 02:44:18.872]  What do these also result in?
[02:44:18.892 --> 02:44:28.098]  They result in deficiencies in certain minerals and certain vitamins, the fat-soluble vitamins that you only get from animal foods, vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamin K2.
[02:44:28.439 --> 02:44:33.862]  These are fat-soluble vitamins that are crucial growth factors for the human organism.
[02:44:34.082 --> 02:44:36.544]  Vitamin D isn't just a vitamin, it's a legit hormone.
[02:44:36.964 --> 02:44:43.909]  Vitamin D is the building block of all your sex steroid hormones, progesterone, estrogen, testosterone.
[02:44:43.989 --> 02:44:51.095]  I mean, the hormonal imbalances that come from nutrient deficiencies have been studied for a hundred years.
[02:44:51.275 --> 02:44:57.840]  So these people know very well that they're going to make money by shifting us into a more plant-based diet.
[02:44:58.880 --> 02:45:05.234]   They know that The physical repercussions are going to result in decreased fertility.
[02:45:06.494 --> 02:45:08.895]  They've done studies and they've known this since the 1940s.
[02:45:08.935 --> 02:45:32.745]   Weston A. Price in his book Nutrition and Physical Degeneration talks about how farmers have always known that if pigs, if a sow If a pregnant sow is deficient in vitamin A, which is a fat-soluble vitamin that's found in animal foods, namely in liver, if a sow is deficient in vitamin A, its children will be born, the offspring, the piglets will be born without eyes.
[02:45:32.825 --> 02:45:37.747]  They will be born deformed, without properly formed optic nerves.
[02:45:38.747 --> 02:45:42.509]  Intense enough deficiency of vitamin A, those piglets will have no eyes.
[02:45:43.129 --> 02:45:49.772]  So I think what a great symbol for exactly what these multinational corporations want.
[02:45:50.612 --> 02:45:51.512]  You're a pig ableist.
[02:45:51.552 --> 02:45:54.153]  You're racist against pigs who have eyes.
[02:45:54.193 --> 02:45:56.654]  That's a form of pig privilege.
[02:45:57.195 --> 02:45:58.315]  So piggy privilege.
[02:45:59.315 --> 02:45:59.996]  You heard it here.
[02:46:00.076 --> 02:46:01.196]  Tristan has been exposed.
[02:46:01.236 --> 02:46:02.477]  He's a piggy privilege promoter.
[02:46:05.295 --> 02:46:07.096]  I'm actually a bioethicist.
[02:46:07.196 --> 02:46:10.239]  I actually did take offense when you introduced me earlier.
[02:46:10.639 --> 02:46:23.371]  Not only am I a YouTuber, an e-celebrity of great importance and of great personal importance, I'm a diva, but I'm also a bioethicist just like Dr. Matthew Lau.
[02:46:23.691 --> 02:46:27.815]  So Dr. Matthew Lau, he's talking about bioengineering human beings.
[02:46:31.033 --> 02:46:37.075]  Yeah, so Dr. Matthew Lau, in 2012, he started publishing articles and giving speeches.
[02:46:37.135 --> 02:46:39.635]  He did a TED Talk where he mentioned this as well.
[02:46:40.015 --> 02:46:44.197]  He thinks that we should bioengineer human beings to be little tiny people, right?
[02:46:44.237 --> 02:46:47.657]  So you could be little tiny people because climate change is so bad, right?
[02:46:47.717 --> 02:46:53.077]   If we will just make people smaller and make them a little bit more compact, they'll consume
[02:46:53.077 --> 02:46:58.697]   less resources, they'll off-gas less dangerous, deadly carbon dioxide.
[02:46:58.697 --> 02:47:02.136]  He's also talking about weaponizing alpha-gal syndrome.
[02:47:02.136 --> 02:47:06.717]   So the lone star tick, that lone star tick which gives people an allergy to meat, he
[02:47:06.717 --> 02:47:13.416]   talked about, well this is possibly a message from evolution where we should just take the
[02:47:13.416 --> 02:47:21.197]   reins of evolution in our own hands and perhaps engineer people using injections or even using
[02:47:21.197 --> 02:47:23.957]  other delivery methods to be allergic to meat.
[02:47:23.983 --> 02:47:26.764]  And this will, of course, decrease our carbon footprint.
[02:47:27.104 --> 02:47:31.205]  So as a bioethicist, I take great offense at you calling me pig ableist.
[02:47:32.025 --> 02:47:44.856]  Because, you know, as a bioethicist, just like our friend here who works at NYU, Oxford, I think he's worked at Stanford, I mean, this guy is a high-level academic who reckons himself a philosopher.
[02:47:47.158 --> 02:47:55.084]  So, us bioethicists, we're here solving the problems of humanity, like there being too many of you, and you being too large.
[02:47:55.145 --> 02:48:19.954]   I know you're a big guy, Jay, you're a big, strong guy, but if we could make you tiny, And a little bit more shriveled, like a little soy-fed vegan, then you would have a lower carbon footprint and you can properly embody the future soy jack, kumpah-dwelling, polycule, funko-pop-marrying global citizen of the future that I know you must admire.
[02:48:22.856 --> 02:48:27.362]  Yeah, I think this is wild because this is all now out in the open.
[02:48:28.404 --> 02:48:44.416]   For those that haven't seen it, if you can find the last Tucker Carlson episode before he was fired was my Eat the Bugs episode together with Ava from She's been on Tucker as well, the Dutch farmer protest gala on Twitter.
[02:48:45.096 --> 02:49:07.426]   Now we've seen a lot of the people in the Netherlands and Germany, these farmers are protesting and this has to do with the attempt to try to shut down Not farming, but independent farming and individual farms and family farms in favor of the big corp, big agra moves that they're trying to make, which are in tandem with the World Economic Forum.
[02:49:07.606 --> 02:49:13.951]  And I know that you did a really fascinating breakdown last year of a lot of Dostoevsky's work.
[02:49:14.111 --> 02:49:35.284]   And you might have thought, well, you might think, well, how does Dostoevsky tie into This and the answer is, as we wait for Tristan to come back, the answer is that the socialists back all the way back to Weishaupt, they had this idea, the communists of yore, that you could reset everything.
[02:49:35.624 --> 02:49:53.932]   And the idea was that if you push this reset button, and sometimes that reset button might have to be forced on everybody, there might have to be a revolution that forces Everything to reset because of the structures of oppression and the structures of, you know, wealth and privilege and nobility.
[02:49:54.012 --> 02:49:59.857]  And now we see that same model that was present in Vi Shop, present in the French revolutionaries.
[02:50:00.518 --> 02:50:20.874]  Present in all revolutionary thought that even Dostoevsky describes in books like Demons and other texts where he points out that these people really have a kind of a most a demonic impetus to destroy everything supposedly for these great noble motives of Starting over I know with Mao or see me with a pole pot.
[02:50:20.894 --> 02:50:37.156]   There was a year zero year one with Jacobins and so forth What is the connection here between what Dostoevsky talks about and this idea of resetting everything and particularly with attacking farming because that's also something I think Stalin did this as well, right?
[02:50:37.577 --> 02:50:40.241]  Why do they go after farming and food to reset everything?
[02:50:42.207 --> 02:50:43.468]  That's a really great tie-in, Jay.
[02:50:43.488 --> 02:50:44.508]  I'm glad you brought that up.
[02:50:44.568 --> 02:50:59.933]  I mean, Dostoevsky's book, Demons, as sometimes the title's translated as The Possessed, is one of the best explorations of kind of the psychology, methodology, and deep human aspect of these revolutionary movements, right?
[02:51:01.014 --> 02:51:04.795]  There's a fantastic passage in that book, which I recommend everybody read.
[02:51:04.815 --> 02:51:29.541]   It's really, it's a little long, but I did do a breakdown on it on my YouTube channel, a two-part breakdown on it where I was tying in The thesis that James H. Billington put forth in his book, Fire in the Minds of Men, you got it right there, one of my favorite books, fantastic book where he's outlining how the real force behind the revolutionaries in the French Revolution
[02:51:30.513 --> 02:51:52.081]   It's not just some hyper-rationalist, empiricist worldview, but it's actually something that goes back much further than the Enlightenment, and it's really rooted in this kind of Promethean, occult desire to take the reins of Control of the world around them and and remake it in essentially their own image.
[02:51:52.581 --> 02:52:01.804]  So yeah, this is passage in Dostoevsky's book Demons by where the character Peter who's an essential he's a nihilist, right?
[02:52:01.824 --> 02:52:19.888]   He's raised by liberals the liberal generation in Russia raised a bunch of flaming nihilists who just want to burn the world down and rebuild it in their own image and he straight-up says in there that I don't care about I don't care about you know liberal ideals or anything like
[02:52:19.888 --> 02:52:27.868]   that is that it's really it's just about Burning things down right and I hold that thought we got to
[02:52:27.868 --> 02:52:33.058]   go to a break. This is the Alex Jones show We'll be right back as we cover the great reset and welcome
[02:52:33.058 --> 02:52:37.208]   back to the Alex Jones I'm your guest host Jay Dyer Jason else's with my good
[02:52:37.208 --> 02:52:40.167]   friend Tristan Haggard and we're talking about the history of the
[02:52:40.847 --> 02:52:47.358]   Evolutionary faith, I think it's important to stress that it is a different type of faith not actually a rational
[02:52:47.358 --> 02:52:50.067]   position Although it's presented as that
[02:52:49.484 --> 02:53:03.304]   It's actually a commitment to The flame of ever-moving, ever-changing stasis and becoming to fight against things that are in permanence and truth and objectivity because everything is flux, everything has changed.
[02:53:03.344 --> 02:53:06.165]  People like Trotsky, people like Mao have said this.
[02:53:06.185 --> 02:53:13.147]  They're really just echoing the philosophy of their predecessors who were the communists again of the ancient time.
[02:53:13.167 --> 02:53:23.379]   For example, in Billington's classic book, he talks about Pythagoras and how the communists, the Bolsheviks, The Jacobins, the Illuminists, they loved Pythagoras.
[02:53:23.999 --> 02:53:25.160]  Why would they love Pythagoras?
[02:53:25.180 --> 02:53:34.288]  Why would they think, well, they thought this is a way to bypass the structures and institutions of the state and the church and to get a direct intuition into nature itself.
[02:53:34.808 --> 02:53:43.855]  And the laws of Pythagoras were not just about geometry, but first and foremost, the forbidding of private property, as well as not eating meat.
[02:53:44.236 --> 02:53:48.519]  So Pythagoras was actually an ancient esoteric mystery school proponent.
[02:53:48.900 --> 02:53:53.677]   He had a Quasi-mystical view of numbers and geometry that they were divine.
[02:53:54.677 --> 02:54:07.044]  And so for Bythagoras, this was a way to have this inner core secret group, which utilized the exterior teaching of a kind of public philosophy for an inner circle of elites.
[02:54:07.104 --> 02:54:37.775]   And that's, I think, what Tristan's getting at, is that these Bolsheviks, these radical communist illuminists that Dostoevsky's perfectly portraying, at least in terms of their psychology in his novels, It's actually a philosophy of total chaos and destruction, so they justify their burning everything down to the ground by saying, well, but we want to build a fairer world, but actually we don't really care about fairness, but we'll use this as a facade, and that's exactly what we see all of today's pro-revolutionaries doing, right?
[02:54:37.835 --> 02:54:40.156]  Like the Extinction Rebellion crowd.
[02:54:43.542 --> 02:54:44.202]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:54:44.262 --> 02:54:44.563]  Absolutely.
[02:54:44.583 --> 02:54:46.184]  And these groups are always well-funded.
[02:54:47.064 --> 02:54:49.305]  They always seem like they're somehow grassroots.
[02:54:49.405 --> 02:54:53.708]  You know, the media will present them as this, oh, look at these, look at this sweet little child, Greta Thunberg.
[02:54:53.748 --> 02:54:58.110]  She's just, she just doesn't want to go to school until we make this climate stop changing.
[02:54:58.190 --> 02:55:05.575]  You know, if you guys would just listen to Bill Gates and listen to the grown-ups like Klaus Schwab, then this poor little girl could go back to school.
[02:55:06.295 --> 02:55:16.819]   So they, you know, they pick these front men that are either You either seem effeminate and weak, or even cartoonishly hyper-masculine.
[02:55:16.839 --> 02:55:24.960]  They even had Arnold Schwarzenegger talking about vegan diets and plant-based diets when he himself never ate a vegan diet, never ate a plant-based diet.
[02:55:24.980 --> 02:55:25.601]  It's not a tumor!
[02:55:25.460 --> 02:55:29.940]   right so it's like they get these these front men to push these ideas but the idea is really
[02:55:29.940 --> 02:55:39.059]   at their core yeah these these ideas at their core are yeah yeah
[02:55:39.225 --> 02:55:40.186]  The tool must be good.
[02:55:40.706 --> 02:55:47.473]  You know, I mean, these, these, these useful idiots, they get used and they get duped by social engineers.
[02:55:47.493 --> 02:55:58.325]  And I think, you know, in Dostoevsky's book, Demons, which is, you know, a fantastic book, he, he actually kind of elucidates on this with this character Shigoyov.
[02:55:58.405 --> 02:56:12.503]   So Shigoyov kind of gives his His philosophy, his political philosophy, his revolutionary philosophy, and in it there's this famous line, he says, I got entangled in my own data and my conclusion directly contradicts the original idea from which I start.
[02:56:13.043 --> 02:56:17.428]  Starting from unlimited freedom, I conclude with unlimited despotism.
[02:56:17.998 --> 02:56:22.542]  I will add, however, that apart from my solution of the social formula, there can be no other.
[02:56:23.022 --> 02:56:40.036]  So the revolutionaries who are selling you on freedom, on liberty, on absolute freedom to be who you want, to love who you want, to transform yourself into who you want, even in their inner circles, as Dostoevsky's showing here through Shigoyov, they know that there's absolute liberty.
[02:56:41.036 --> 02:56:42.837]  Actually results in absolute tyranny.
[02:56:42.917 --> 02:56:44.657]  Look what happened with the French Revolution.
[02:56:44.697 --> 02:56:54.301]  You had Napoleon, who was a sort of anti-Christ figure in many ways, crowning himself, which was something that was formerly done in the church where he lived.
[02:56:55.321 --> 02:56:56.721]  You've got Napoleon rising up.
[02:56:56.761 --> 02:57:04.404]  You've got Stalinism, Leninism, rising out of these so-called democratic movements like the Bolsheviks brought about.
[02:57:05.305 --> 02:57:11.133]  But really, the point is not to create this perfectly neutral good society.
[02:57:11.193 --> 02:57:21.068]  The point is, as Shigolyov later elucidates here, he says, one-tenth is granted freedom of person and unlimited rights over the remaining nine-tenths.
[02:57:21.838 --> 02:57:27.542]  So, what he's saying there is what we see in all of these revolutions.
[02:57:27.862 --> 02:57:29.864]  They sell everybody on, you're going to have freedom.
[02:57:30.204 --> 02:57:33.026]  You're going to have freedom to chop your kids' wieners off.
[02:57:33.046 --> 02:57:39.430]  You're going to have the freedom to live in your pod and just imagine whatever reality you want.
[02:57:39.470 --> 02:57:42.152]  You're going to be uploaded into the cloud and you'll be immortal.
[02:57:42.192 --> 02:57:43.673]  They sell you on all this stuff.
[02:57:44.193 --> 02:58:10.010]  And freedom and liberty is always the calling card, but really it's what they're looking for is the freedom and liberty for 1% or 10% as he says in Demons to rule as despots over the 90% whose passions and their kind of fallen vice-based desires will lead them into the revolutionary fervor to tear down the world around them.
[02:58:10.470 --> 02:58:19.037]  Which will then, of course, lead to the tyranny of these few who have manipulated them into this essentially Luciferian philosophy, right?
[02:58:20.137 --> 02:58:28.243]  The devil in the garden, the snake in the garden comes to Eve and sells man on, well, you are going to be like gods.
[02:58:28.864 --> 02:58:31.466]  You are going to be in charge and you won't die.
[02:58:32.086 --> 02:58:33.607]  Right, well of course we know that was all a lie.
[02:58:33.627 --> 02:58:40.309]  Yeah, doesn't that character in that novel say something like, this can only come in on a mountain of skulls?
[02:58:40.629 --> 02:58:43.930]  And he mentions like some... Yeah, he says we're gonna need a hundred million.
[02:58:44.050 --> 02:58:56.154]  I think he puts out the number of... So he was actually, this was prior to the Russian Revolution, so this was actually prophetic in a way, because I think it ended up being, people estimate, 60, 50, 60 million, somewhere in there.
[02:58:57.173 --> 02:58:57.953]  And so he was actually pretty close.
[02:58:57.973 --> 02:59:03.336]  Yeah, well, maybe if you include the Chinese, if you include the Maoist Revolution, you know, you'd probably get to around a hundred million.
[02:59:03.996 --> 02:59:07.317]  And that's actually from the same rant that he did here.
[02:59:07.398 --> 02:59:12.100]  So I suggest you guys check out on my YouTube channel, it's Tristan Haggard on YouTube.
[02:59:12.420 --> 02:59:16.379]   I did a detailed breakdown, a two-part series, and they're each about three hours,
[02:59:16.379 --> 02:59:20.379]   talking about Dostoevsky's demons, tying in the revolutionary spirit
[02:59:20.379 --> 02:59:27.379]   and the history of the revolution with this scathing and cutting piece of literature
[02:59:27.379 --> 02:59:32.819]   that Dostoevsky gives us here, which totally connects to what we see happening right now
[02:59:32.819 --> 02:59:34.379]  in the Great Reset.
[02:59:34.379 --> 02:59:38.219]  Dostoevsky's talking about the Great Reset in the 1860s.
[02:59:38.219 --> 02:59:41.860]  This is when he's, after he was actually a revolutionary.
[02:59:41.860 --> 02:59:45.299]   In these types of circles, studying Fourier and some of these
[02:59:45.299 --> 02:59:49.020]   French revolutionaries figures, he was in these literary circles
[02:59:49.020 --> 02:59:52.599]   that were actually plotting and planning a violent overthrow of the government.
[02:59:52.565 --> 03:00:04.929]  He ended up repenting of this and having a major switch in character, in beliefs, and embracing tradition, and embracing Christianity, embracing the Church.
[03:00:06.510 --> 03:00:14.282]   So Dostoevsky is a fascinating figure, and these revolutionaries we see today, They want us sick.
[03:00:14.743 --> 03:00:15.643]  They want us stupid.
[03:00:16.043 --> 03:00:17.144]  They want us distracted.
[03:00:17.204 --> 03:00:19.085]  And they want us enslaved to vice.
[03:00:19.545 --> 03:00:29.970]  Which is why they're constantly pushing vice on us while telling us that our asceticism needs to be based on us just believing we're bad for being human.
[03:00:30.290 --> 03:00:35.433]  You're bad if you eat meat, even though this is the only food that you can eat.
[03:00:35.493 --> 03:00:37.894]  Red meat is the only food you can eat exclusively.
[03:00:37.954 --> 03:00:39.915]  You can live off of nothing but red meat.
[03:00:39.935 --> 03:00:41.156]  I'm not saying everybody should.
[03:00:41.676 --> 03:00:43.217]  But a lot of people actually are.
[03:00:43.597 --> 03:00:51.840]  So they declare this month to be Veganuary, and the kind of vegan propagandists have been spouting this every year.
[03:00:52.220 --> 03:01:06.771]   But a few years ago, Dr. Sean Baker, who was just recently on the Joe Rogan Show, Joe Rogan Experience podcast, He started the World Carnivore Month, which if you look at Google Trends, it's funny, with zero corporate sponsors, with nothing but grassroots interest and, you know, podcasts.
[03:01:06.831 --> 03:01:08.693]  Hold on, I've got a thought about Dr. Baker.
[03:01:08.753 --> 03:01:09.794]  We've got to go to a break.
[03:01:09.814 --> 03:01:10.535]  We'll be right back.
[03:01:10.575 --> 03:01:11.716]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:01:12.197 --> 03:01:14.239]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's happening.
[03:01:14.719 --> 03:01:17.923]  Two years in the making, and we didn't plan it like this, because we didn't know.
[03:01:18.743 --> 03:01:26.890]  To release Alex Jones New World Order Wars that's all about fighting Epstein and Clinton and Hillary and the Deep State and the pedo-rigs.
[03:01:27.030 --> 03:01:31.194]  Whole levels just dealing with that because that's the truth of how they operate.
[03:01:31.474 --> 03:01:35.637]  And now the game went on Steam, the biggest online platform of video games in the world.
[03:01:35.656 --> 03:01:40.656]  150 million users a week and it already shot to number one.
[03:01:40.656 --> 03:01:48.956]   So find the link to Steam at alexjonesgame.com or search Alex Jones New World Order Wars at Steam and get it for
[03:01:48.956 --> 03:01:49.656]  yourself.
[03:01:49.656 --> 03:01:53.656]  It's got an incredible 97% reviews.
[03:01:53.656 --> 03:01:58.656]  We'll put the link to Steam on screen and to alexjonesgame.com.
[03:01:58.656 --> 03:02:01.656]  Get it. We are taking back the culture.
[03:02:01.416 --> 03:02:02.436]  We are taking things back.
[03:02:02.756 --> 03:02:05.537]  This will fund the info war going into the election the next 10 months.
[03:02:05.957 --> 03:02:07.678]  The only way we fail is if we don't take action.
[03:02:07.738 --> 03:02:10.519]  Get New World Order Wars by Alex Jones now!
[03:02:11.759 --> 03:02:12.860]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:02:12.880 --> 03:02:14.801]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:02:14.841 --> 03:02:21.250]   If you like this analysis, You can be sure to head on over to my website and check out the shop there.
[03:02:21.290 --> 03:02:24.172]  And in the shop, you can see I have my books for sale.
[03:02:24.192 --> 03:02:31.177]  There is the Red Book, which is about 660 pages of all my geopolitical and religious essays over the last 10 years.
[03:02:31.237 --> 03:02:39.823]  My two books on Hollywood and Symbolism, Esoteric Hollywood I and II, signed copies are available in the shop, as well as my little philosophy book, Metanarratives.
[03:02:39.843 --> 03:02:45.177]   And of course, you can go to primaledgehealth.com and check out Tristan's Carnivore Cookbook.
[03:02:45.417 --> 03:02:46.417]  Now we were talking, there it is.
[03:02:47.098 --> 03:02:48.038]  I have that very book.
[03:02:48.078 --> 03:02:49.799]  We've used it many times.
[03:02:50.820 --> 03:03:00.185]  Because Tristan actually introduced me to this interesting approach to diet where we scale down the carbs and we heal our guts with meat.
[03:03:01.205 --> 03:03:04.727]  And you were talking about Dr. Sean Baker being on the Joe Rogan Podcast.
[03:03:04.747 --> 03:03:13.492]  And I remember years ago, first coming across you talking to Michaela Peterson about diet and how the carnivore diet can heal our guts and all that.
[03:03:14.116 --> 03:03:29.665]  And I'm curious, again, I think this ties into why they really want to go after meat, because I've heard you talk about meat being one of the, that our guts are kind of like designed to absorb the most nutrients from meat.
[03:03:29.805 --> 03:03:39.271]  Aren't we made that way that we actually, like if we were eating a bunch of greens, we would absorb far fewer nutrients than if we were eating meats and meat fat.
[03:03:39.110 --> 03:03:40.110]  Is that correct?
[03:03:40.110 --> 03:03:45.230]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[03:03:45.230 --> 03:03:48.830]   It's like V-Ganuary, which I was mentioning Dr. Sean Baker's appearance
[03:03:49.709 --> 03:04:04.160]  If you look at, just like on Google Trends, now of course Veganuary is pumped out there by these, you know, vegan influencers, celebrities, and there's a multi-billion dollar industry behind pushing fake meat, and they push these trends like Veganuary.
[03:04:04.220 --> 03:04:07.062]  Look, Sean Baker started World Carnivore Month a few years ago.
[03:04:07.082 --> 03:04:20.288]   And if you look on Google Trends, it's not that far behind for having zero corporate Backing, nobody talking about it, rather than just legit grassroots people trying to get their health in line and trying to get themselves healthy.
[03:04:20.688 --> 03:04:27.410]  So yeah, I mean, meat, I mentioned earlier, red meat is the only food that you can live off of exclusively.
[03:04:27.450 --> 03:04:37.433]  There's a book by Wilhelm R. Stephenson, and he lived among the Inuit for several years and ate an all-meat diet, which at the time, it was assumed you would get scurvy.
[03:04:37.593 --> 03:04:41.114]  If you don't get enough vitamin C, you will get scurvy, was common knowledge.
[03:04:41.574 --> 03:04:42.935]  Well, he proved that this was wrong.
[03:04:42.955 --> 03:04:54.622]  And not only was it wrong, in the experiment they did in a hospital in New York, I think it was a Bellevue Hospital, with him and another guy where they ate nothing but animal foods.
[03:04:54.742 --> 03:04:59.385]  So they would eat meat, they would consume organs, which was very normal at the time.
[03:04:59.405 --> 03:05:07.190]   Now, so many of us have moved away from eating things like liver, heart, some of these more Uncommonly consumed cuts.
[03:05:07.631 --> 03:05:08.772]  And that's what they ate.
[03:05:08.912 --> 03:05:11.614]  They ate a diet of nothing but meat.
[03:05:11.694 --> 03:05:14.316]  I think they may have included some eggs in there as well.
[03:05:14.957 --> 03:05:26.246]  And both of the members, both of the subjects of this study of an all meat diet, this is in the 1930s, both of them had exceptional health and one of them had their gingivitis reversed.
[03:05:26.827 --> 03:05:30.690]  So yes, meat is very bioavailable.
[03:05:32.131 --> 03:05:33.873]  It's very easy to digest.
[03:05:33.953 --> 03:05:42.983]  And I think the problem is less that we weren't designed to eat plants, but I think the plants that we're consuming now are essentially not designed to be consumed.
[03:05:43.484 --> 03:05:45.766]  So we're eating GMO corn, which is so...
[03:05:47.608 --> 03:05:51.772]  Yeah, the GMO corn that we're consuming, GMO soy, these are soaked in glyphosate.
[03:05:52.073 --> 03:05:57.038]  They use these pesticides that are actually patented as antibiotics.
[03:05:57.619 --> 03:06:12.436]   Glyphosate is a patented antibiotic that's meant to strip the soil of minerals, namely manganese, because it kills the microorganisms that uptake that mineral and the plants that we're consuming in our so-called
[03:06:12.436 --> 03:06:20.747]   plant-based diet, they're all based on these GMO corn, GMO soy platforms. And this
[03:06:20.747 --> 03:06:26.858]   leads to not just malnutrition if we eat a heavily plant-based diet, but also damage to the
[03:06:26.858 --> 03:06:27.198]  gut.
[03:06:27.438 --> 03:06:30.700]  We know that glyphosate damages the microvilli in the gut.
[03:06:30.720 --> 03:06:40.064]  The gut has these millions of little tiny microscopic finger-looking nodules all throughout it that are meant to digest food.
[03:06:40.104 --> 03:06:44.606]  Anybody who's ever butchered a cow and seen the inside of a cow's rumen, it's beautiful.
[03:06:44.666 --> 03:06:46.647]  It actually looks like a mushroom or something.
[03:06:46.666 --> 03:06:53.345]   You can see millions of these little kind of billy style nodules within the rumen of
[03:06:53.345 --> 03:06:58.906]   a cow and in these folds of the rumen are plant material that is fermenting.
[03:06:58.906 --> 03:07:01.466]  Now that's an animal that's designed to eat grass.
[03:07:01.479 --> 03:07:08.481]  We're not designed to eat grass, but our guts are actually a little bit similar to the rumen with the microvilli in our gut.
[03:07:08.741 --> 03:07:31.068]   It is almost similar to how the rumen of a ruminant looks because those little microvilli are designed to take up nutrients to move through that process called peristalsis, the food through Through the gut, you start to damage the gut with things like glyphosate, with anti-nutrients like lectins that are in a lot of these grains that we're told we should replace meat with.
[03:07:31.529 --> 03:07:35.250]  Well, these grains, they can actually be damaging.
[03:07:35.310 --> 03:07:46.235]  And it's not that they're inherently bad, but when you look at the diets of our ancestors, you look at the diets of people a hundred years ago, they knew that you had to properly prepare these grains to consume them.
[03:07:46.674 --> 03:07:49.314]  They would soak and ferment oats, right?
[03:07:49.314 --> 03:07:53.814]   They would soak and ferment things like sourdough, traditional preparation of wheat,
[03:07:53.814 --> 03:07:59.113]  and also the old strains of wheat that were so common.
[03:07:59.113 --> 03:08:03.393]   Einkorn wheat is getting kind of popular now because people realize we're all just eating
[03:08:03.393 --> 03:08:09.414]   these single strains of these foods when there are thousands of different varieties of wheat.
[03:08:09.414 --> 03:08:15.754]   And the preparation of these foods is really important, and that preparation removes what are called anti-nutrients.
[03:08:15.754 --> 03:08:19.634]  So in nuts, for instance, you have a lot of phytates.
[03:08:19.634 --> 03:08:25.393]   Phytic acid binds to magnesium and basically makes it inabsorbable.
[03:08:25.780 --> 03:08:34.350]  So you've got these anti-nutrients in the plants we're eating, but when you look at a nutrition facts label, it's going to tell you, oh, look at all this magnesium in a Brazil nut.
[03:08:34.771 --> 03:08:42.079]  I can totally replace shellfish and fish, which are great sources of potassium, magnesium.
[03:08:42.139 --> 03:08:45.023]  I can totally replace animal foods with this.
[03:08:45.584 --> 03:08:57.655]   Well, Really, those nutrients, when you look at the calcium level in something like spinach even, spinach is full of anti-nutrients that will bind, namely
[03:08:58.659 --> 03:09:06.944]  Oxalates that will bind to that calcium, form little crystals, and even lodge in your kidneys and give you kidney stones.
[03:09:07.364 --> 03:09:15.169]  So people making these green smoothies and stuff all day, thinking they're going to get healthy from their green smoothie with raw spinach, that stuff's not meant to be eaten raw.
[03:09:15.189 --> 03:09:18.931]  You're supposed to boil that stuff to even make it palatable.
[03:09:18.951 --> 03:09:23.154]  So we've got to be careful with a lot of these so-called plant-based foods they're pushing on us.
[03:09:23.194 --> 03:09:25.155]  But you know what's always easily digested?
[03:09:25.875 --> 03:09:26.436]  Animal foods.
[03:09:27.057 --> 03:09:30.000]  Meat is the easiest food to digest.
[03:09:30.020 --> 03:09:39.071]  And people with wrecked guts who've been eating kind of the kibble-based diet, I mean, my whole generation was raised on cereal and grains, right?
[03:09:39.091 --> 03:09:42.635]  And the breakfast cereals are just complete, it's toxic sludge kibble.
[03:09:42.875 --> 03:09:45.273]  with freaking cartoon characters on the box, right?
[03:09:45.273 --> 03:09:50.875]   You stop eating foods that have cartoon characters on the box and stop allowing yourself to be infantilized
[03:09:50.875 --> 03:09:52.154]  as an adult, right?
[03:09:52.154 --> 03:09:57.274]   Stop eating Funko Popcorn Pops for breakfast and start having bacon and eggs.
[03:09:57.274 --> 03:09:58.875]  You're going to feel better.
[03:09:58.875 --> 03:10:00.875]  Your blood sugar's gonna be more stable.
[03:10:00.875 --> 03:10:02.074]  Your gut's gonna function.
[03:10:02.074 --> 03:10:04.394]  Yeah, I know that.
[03:10:04.394 --> 03:10:05.354]  But anyways, that's--
[03:10:05.354 --> 03:10:11.194]   I can attest to that because I went to Italy for three weeks about a month ago
[03:10:11.834 --> 03:10:17.514]   and they have really strict laws over there about what foods can be imported,
[03:10:17.514 --> 03:10:19.754]  what foods can be sold and so forth.
[03:10:20.028 --> 03:10:23.591]  And so they're very strict against GMOs and things like that.
[03:10:23.611 --> 03:10:24.833]  They have a lot of other problems.
[03:10:25.133 --> 03:10:26.734]  It's quasi-socialist, basically.
[03:10:29.187 --> 03:10:31.008]  I was able to eat pretty much everything over there.
[03:10:31.488 --> 03:10:46.093]  And in the U.S., I can't do that because we're basically ruled by Fortune 100, Fortune 500, which are able to basically do a revolving door scenario when, you know, the Food and Drug Administration is just peopled by people from Monsanto and vice versa, back and forth.
[03:10:46.513 --> 03:10:52.755]  So they can basically push anything they want going back to, you know, Donald Rumsfeld and Aspartame and all that kind of stuff.
[03:10:53.575 --> 03:11:14.242]  And so, you know, you've highlighted the F. William Engdahl book, Seeds of Destruction, and the reason I bring that up is that, you know, a lot of the writings of the elite, whether it's Charles Galton Darwin or whether it's Bertrand Russell, you know, they were writing decades ago that the diet would be a key way to go after and attack the population in general.
[03:11:14.283 --> 03:11:30.598]   And remember, these are Malthusians, these are eugenicists, so I always wonder if they're not Maybe engineering the plant-based stuff on purpose to be essentially detrimental to our health, perhaps even producing sterilization down the road.
[03:11:30.618 --> 03:11:31.058]  Who knows?
[03:11:31.098 --> 03:11:34.861]  We don't even know all the effects of all the GMO diet and all that.
[03:11:34.901 --> 03:11:51.469]   So when we come back, I want to ask Tristan about the GMO diet, seeds of destruction, this idea, and why they're pushing this so hard, as well as tying it to things like austerity, Tying it to things like antinatalism, extinction rebellion, and why that's pushed by the wealthiest people on the planet.
[03:11:51.490 --> 03:11:52.390]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:11:52.410 --> 03:11:52.910]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:11:53.270 --> 03:11:54.310]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:11:54.330 --> 03:11:54.610]  I'm your guest.
[03:11:54.630 --> 03:11:56.391]  This is Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:11:56.571 --> 03:12:06.253]  If you are enjoying this, be sure to head on over to my YouTube channel where I have an in-depth breakdown with Jason Bermas on the whole Epstein saga.
[03:12:06.273 --> 03:12:18.543]   Bermas has done a lot of research, and if you know this week, Alex and Burmas had a couple viral videos this last week that went all over X. So be sure and go watch my interview with Jason Burmas on the Epstein list.
[03:12:18.643 --> 03:12:22.047]  And that's just one vector, as we said, of this attack.
[03:12:22.489 --> 03:12:25.032]  That the elite have against the population in general.
[03:12:25.592 --> 03:12:33.920]  Basically, we all know that the end goal is to drastically reduce the population 80, 90% in the next decade or so.
[03:12:34.040 --> 03:12:38.124]  We know that there's some sort of big event that a lot of the elite are talking about.
[03:12:38.164 --> 03:12:39.125]  Could be a psyop.
[03:12:39.406 --> 03:12:43.369]   Then again, it could be that They really do have big things planned for 2024.
[03:12:43.429 --> 03:12:50.113]  We know that World Economic Forum and other entities have mentioned the desire to get ahead of the curve in terms of depopulation by 2030.
[03:12:50.494 --> 03:12:53.096]  They want to bring down the numbers big time.
[03:12:53.316 --> 03:12:55.918]  We've got to get those numbers down, like Bill Gates says.
[03:12:55.938 --> 03:12:59.000]  And my guest is Tristan Haggard of Primal Edge Health.
[03:12:59.040 --> 03:13:10.793]   Tristan, we were talking about antinatalism, extinction rebellion, and how this ties into this diet fat, this propaganda, this psyop of you need to be vegan
[03:13:10.793 --> 03:13:15.674]   now, you need to not eat meat, you need to not have children, it's all bad for the planet.
[03:13:15.674 --> 03:13:20.793]  It all goes together, doesn't it?
[03:13:20.793 --> 03:13:31.576]  I've done so many debates with vegans over the years, and I'm trying to think of a single vegan I've debated that didn't express antinatalist attitudes during our debate.
[03:13:33.817 --> 03:13:39.179]  Veganism, extreme secular asceticism, which is what it basically is, right?
[03:13:39.219 --> 03:13:43.061]   It's a starving yourself Why do you hate Harambe?
[03:13:42.880 --> 03:13:49.599]   Make yourself malnourished, pale, sickly, and gaunt, so that Bambi can survive and Simba
[03:13:49.599 --> 03:13:53.680]  can become the king of the jungle again, right?
[03:13:53.680 --> 03:13:54.680]  Because humans are so bad.
[03:13:54.680 --> 03:13:57.600]  Why do you hate Harambe?
[03:13:57.600 --> 03:14:02.120]   You want Harambe and Cecil to die, basically, is what you're saying?
[03:14:02.120 --> 03:14:03.161]  Exactly, right?
[03:14:03.160 --> 03:14:06.082]  Like, it's your fault that Harambe does climate change killed Harambe.
[03:14:06.943 --> 03:14:11.247]  And if you just had less children, then everything would be okay.
[03:14:11.627 --> 03:14:16.111]  And you mentioned F. William Engdahl's book, which I really cite so much.
[03:14:18.033 --> 03:14:56.631]   One thing, one of the most important pieces of information in his book is in his chapter talking about antinatalism and population reduction and the tie-in of The GMO revolution, which of course is funded and bankrolled by the Rockefeller Foundation, which is propped up by universities like Harvard, and he talks about how in 2001, on September 9th, Sunday, 9th of September 2001, an article was published in the Guardian, and the article was titled, GM Corn Set to Stop Man Spreading His Seed.
[03:14:57.410 --> 03:15:01.932]  Scientists have created the ultimate GM crop, contraceptive corn.
[03:15:02.373 --> 03:15:07.515]  Waving fields of maize may one day save the world from overpopulation.
[03:15:07.575 --> 03:15:12.855]   So this is an article about EpiCite, a company, a biotech company based in San Diego that
[03:15:12.855 --> 03:15:19.615]   developed this corn that would basically, so their quote here says, "We have a hothouse
[03:15:19.615 --> 03:15:23.835]  filled with corn plants that make anti-sperm antibodies,"
[03:15:23.835 --> 03:15:27.134]   said EpiCite president, Mitch Hines.
[03:15:27.134 --> 03:15:33.975]   So they're talking about developing corn plants to make antibodies against sperm.
[03:15:33.975 --> 03:15:40.374]   This is sold as this great way to help stop climate change or AKA overpopulation because
[03:15:40.374 --> 03:15:46.215]   those two terms have kind of become, a lot of the climate change people, they know it's
[03:15:46.215 --> 03:15:50.855]   kind of a faux pas to use the word overpopulation because of the backlash they'll get from the
[03:15:50.855 --> 03:15:55.534]   people that point out that climate change is an anti-human, anti-natalist movement.
[03:15:55.921 --> 03:15:57.762]  But those terms are basically synonymous.
[03:15:58.142 --> 03:16:04.588]   Climate change, overpopulation, Guys like Bill Gates have referenced the connection so many times.
[03:16:04.648 --> 03:16:19.321]  His famous thing was like, well, if we've got one equation over here and we've got people times services times the amount of carbon and the other side, we've got to get that as close to zero as possible.
[03:16:19.781 --> 03:16:39.129]   So if we could just really just move one of these factors, which includes human population, If we can move that as close to zero as possible, we can stop Mammy Earth from being so sad, and we can all live happily ever after, and Simba and Bambi will skip through the woods together.
[03:16:41.009 --> 03:16:44.129]  So these people are psychopaths.
[03:16:44.169 --> 03:16:48.050]  Who is going to develop GM corn that will force sterilize people?
[03:16:48.450 --> 03:16:51.271]  Well, EpiCyte, I think it was bought up.
[03:16:51.771 --> 03:16:52.711]  It might have been bought up.
[03:16:53.525 --> 03:16:58.005]  by a Defense Department connected company.
[03:16:58.005 --> 03:17:02.965]   And the Department of Defense actually did trials with the company EpiCyte of growing
[03:17:02.965 --> 03:17:07.605]  fields of this spermicidal corn, which is insane.
[03:17:07.605 --> 03:17:13.885]   And there were a lot of speculations that the vaccines, aka the
[03:17:13.879 --> 03:17:22.904]  the experimental coup stabbies in the last three years, might have also been tied to sterilization and the possibility of people becoming sterile in the future.
[03:17:23.324 --> 03:17:26.406]  We know they want to do that as to what means they'll use.
[03:17:26.446 --> 03:17:28.788]  I think all possibilities are on the table.
[03:17:28.808 --> 03:17:39.274]   Diet, You know, culture, toxic culture is another huge element of this where we now have zoomers and people of that age group and younger now saying, oh, I want to be a dink.
[03:17:39.314 --> 03:17:41.355]  We're going to be dual income, no kids.
[03:17:41.395 --> 03:17:42.756]  We're not going to have any offspring.
[03:17:43.357 --> 03:17:49.360]  That allows us to travel the world and do all this, you know, stuff that no one else can do if they have kids.
[03:17:49.400 --> 03:17:51.762]  And it's so miserable and you're so unhappy if you have kids.
[03:17:52.719 --> 03:17:53.359]  You have kids.
[03:17:53.399 --> 03:17:56.323]  I think, you know, you're a lot happier as a person who has kids.
[03:17:56.723 --> 03:18:00.187]  Everybody that has kids tells me, you know, they're much happier having children.
[03:18:01.129 --> 03:18:14.783]   Some people are obviously in situations where they can't, so I'm not knocking people in that situation or trying to be self-righteous, but the point is that this is being pushed at a societal level For the purpose of cultural and social engineering.
[03:18:14.823 --> 03:18:21.027]  And now we find social media, the algorithm boosting and pushing all these idiots on TikTok.
[03:18:21.107 --> 03:18:23.188]  I know that you're going to be covering tonight on your channel.
[03:18:23.708 --> 03:18:27.631]  A lot of this nonsense is promoted on TikTok, which is total brainwashing.
[03:18:28.251 --> 03:18:33.254]  And this again goes along with the Agitprop that Extinction Rebellion engages in.
[03:18:33.814 --> 03:18:34.775]  It's not organic.
[03:18:34.835 --> 03:18:35.756]  This is what people have to figure out.
[03:18:35.776 --> 03:18:39.698]  This is fostered and funded by the wealthiest people on the planet.
[03:18:41.847 --> 03:18:42.348]  Absolutely.
[03:18:42.649 --> 03:18:43.009]  Absolutely.
[03:18:43.050 --> 03:18:52.526]  And something you covered so extensively is how worldview warfare is the methodology of the elite, of Weltanschauungskrieg.
[03:18:52.947 --> 03:19:11.858]   These people love to Influence your behavior by what they call behaviorism, which is this, you know, assumed position that the scientific establishment has taken that human beings basically, behaviorists don't believe that human beings have a soul.
[03:19:12.239 --> 03:19:17.662]  And if they do, there's no way to quantify and measure the movements of the soul.
[03:19:18.042 --> 03:19:21.825]  So scientifically, let's just disregard that concept altogether.
[03:19:22.205 --> 03:19:25.747]  All we're looking at in organisms is pure stimulus response.
[03:19:26.168 --> 03:19:29.610]  So they're treating this culture almost like a giant Skinner box.
[03:19:29.990 --> 03:19:37.135]  So you see articles like in the Washington Post, the fourth quarter of last year, they published this article about how Millennials aren't having children.
[03:19:37.155 --> 03:19:38.656]  It's called Millennials aren't having kids.
[03:19:38.996 --> 03:19:39.537]  Here's why.
[03:19:39.997 --> 03:19:42.579]  We found some answers when looking into a different mystery.
[03:19:43.039 --> 03:19:46.181]   What's going on with Only children.
[03:19:46.722 --> 03:19:50.425]  So a lot of people are only having one kid or having no kids.
[03:19:50.605 --> 03:20:00.293]  The fertility rates, as Elon Musk has even highlighted, you know, one of the few elites that's actually taken a non-anti-natalist position is Elon lately.
[03:20:00.974 --> 03:20:09.781]   And I'm not saying I agree with everything he says, but he's definitely right on the fact that We are looking at not just a population crisis.
[03:20:09.801 --> 03:20:12.162]  We're not looking at a population crisis because there's too many people.
[03:20:12.482 --> 03:20:28.530]   We're looking at a population crisis because we don't have enough kids to replace the dying boomer generations and the Gen Xers and now the Millennials who are suddenly dying of cancer, of rapidly aggressive onset cancer all of a sudden after the last three years.
[03:20:28.530 --> 03:20:33.450]   But they talk about the reasons people are not having children, the reasons namely millennials
[03:20:33.450 --> 03:20:34.649]  aren't having children.
[03:20:34.649 --> 03:20:39.530]   And they said that 56 percent, and this is a survey-based study done by Pew Research,
[03:20:39.530 --> 03:20:43.369]  which the surveys themselves are used to influence behavior.
[03:20:43.369 --> 03:20:48.229]   The way that these questions are worded are used to drive people to give certain answers.
[03:20:48.229 --> 03:20:51.389]   So I'm not saying that all these survey-based studies are great.
[03:20:51.389 --> 03:20:52.389]  They're used in social engineering.
[03:20:52.389 --> 03:20:56.829]   You know, Walter Lippmann in the 1920s when he wrote Public Opinion said that he figured
[03:20:56.829 --> 03:21:01.309]   out that surveys were one of the key ways to influence public opinion.
[03:21:01.275 --> 03:21:02.696]  The surveys themselves are psyops.
[03:21:04.317 --> 03:21:04.917]  Exactly.
[03:21:05.178 --> 03:21:06.378]  Yeah, perfectly stated.
[03:21:06.739 --> 03:21:10.981]  So they say a hefty 56% said they just didn't want kids.
[03:21:11.362 --> 03:21:20.508]  The remainder pointed to medical reasons, financial reasons, a lack of a partner, the state of the world, and climate change came in a distant fifth and sixth.
[03:21:21.048 --> 03:21:21.909]  Out of seven.
[03:21:22.009 --> 03:21:25.352]  So, they just don't want kids.
[03:21:25.512 --> 03:21:26.933]  Why don't they want kids?
[03:21:27.314 --> 03:21:28.635]  Well, it's been studied.
[03:21:28.655 --> 03:21:57.501]   The Rockefeller Foundation actually studied this, and they published this in the Rockefeller Population Council Report, which was, I think this was, was it, Population in the American Future, the report of the Commission on Population Growth in the American Future, and that was commissioned under Richard Nixon, and then also in the Kissinger Report, They specifically talk about methodologies for decreasing human fertility rates by getting women to choose not to have kids.
[03:21:57.862 --> 03:21:59.143]  And some of those are economic.
[03:21:59.684 --> 03:22:02.627]  Others are mass media.
[03:22:02.768 --> 03:22:09.275]  They actually suggest using mass media and changing the image of the ideal family in mass media, which you cover in your book.
[03:22:09.355 --> 03:22:11.876]  Yeah, don't forget the Jaffe memo.
[03:22:11.916 --> 03:22:13.476]  Tristan has done live streams on that.
[03:22:13.536 --> 03:22:14.977]  Listen, this has been a great interview.
[03:22:15.017 --> 03:22:21.679]  Go follow primaledgehealth.com website and then Tristan Haggard on YouTube and then my channel as well.
[03:22:21.939 --> 03:22:25.200]  We cannot hide away from human population growth.
[03:22:25.609 --> 03:22:35.056]  The negative impact of population growth on all of our planetary ecosystems is becoming appallingly evident.
[03:22:35.576 --> 03:22:43.282]  The problem is that the population is growing the fastest where people are less able to deal with it.
[03:22:43.442 --> 03:22:50.287]  All these things we talk about wouldn't be a problem if there was the size of population that there was 500 years ago.
[03:22:51.328 --> 03:23:03.116]  When we invest in clean energy and electric vehicles and reduce population... and reduce population... So let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero.
[03:23:03.556 --> 03:23:08.720]  Nobody has the balls to come out and say it and just say, look, 85% of you have to go.
[03:23:09.541 --> 03:23:12.503]  Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
[03:23:13.499 --> 03:23:17.260]  Now that's back from high school algebra, but let's take a look.
[03:23:17.500 --> 03:23:21.021]  What would you call the debate and discussions about a pro-human future?
[03:23:21.061 --> 03:23:21.921]  Just Team Humanity?
[03:23:22.661 --> 03:23:23.562]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[03:23:23.722 --> 03:23:24.142]  Absolutely.
[03:23:24.702 --> 03:23:25.762]  That sounds good.
[03:23:26.142 --> 03:23:29.223]  You just literally have to have kids or there's no next generation.
[03:23:29.243 --> 03:23:37.545]  You know, I'm super pro-human for Team Humanity here, and I just think we want to make sure that people have a positive view of the future.
[03:23:37.685 --> 03:23:39.166]  Don't predict the future.
[03:23:39.746 --> 03:23:40.486]  Be the future.
[03:23:41.124 --> 03:23:44.685]  Yes, the guy who came up with this, but the best way to predict the future is to create it.
[03:23:44.925 --> 03:23:45.145]  Yes.
[03:23:45.726 --> 03:23:46.686]  We got to make a good showing.
[03:23:47.126 --> 03:23:47.626]  Team Human.
[03:23:48.487 --> 03:23:54.189]  I recently had a chance to talk to Elon Musk live on air for more than two and a half hours.
[03:23:54.809 --> 03:24:02.751]  And he talked about how the globalists want to destroy civilization and depopulate humanity and how evil that is and how he's had 11 children to challenge that.
[03:24:03.112 --> 03:24:03.752]  It was incredible.
[03:24:04.572 --> 03:24:06.412]  I said, "I don't know what we should call this movement."
[03:24:06.412 --> 03:24:09.291]  I said, "Why don't we call it Team Humanity?"
[03:24:09.291 --> 03:24:10.291]  And he agreed with me.
[03:24:10.291 --> 03:24:12.092]  Now, I've been talking about Team Humanity.
[03:24:12.092 --> 03:24:15.491]   It's my concept to counter the globalists that say humanity is horrible and evil and
[03:24:15.491 --> 03:24:17.212]  bad for a long time.
[03:24:17.212 --> 03:24:23.012]   But now more than ever with Elon Musk behind it, if all of you get behind it, we can build
[03:24:23.012 --> 03:24:29.492]   momentum against King Charles and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and Jane Goodall and the New
[03:24:29.492 --> 03:24:33.771]   World Order that wants us all to hate ourselves and turn off our life force and crawl into
[03:24:33.771 --> 03:24:37.772]   our graves and leave the planet for them. We're not going to do that.
[03:24:38.289 --> 03:24:53.136]  We have a limited edition, two different versions, Team Humanity shirts at InfoWarStore.com that are historic, that are limited edition, and are fundraiser shirts to keep InfoWars in the critical year of 2024 on the air.
[03:24:53.776 --> 03:25:03.440]  We're reaching tens of millions of new people a day just because of X, and I'm so thankful to Elon Musk and so thankful to all of you in the core of the InfoWar that have kept us on air.
[03:25:03.781 --> 03:25:08.808]   So get the shirt, Support the InfoWar and know that you are on Team Humanity.
[03:25:09.128 --> 03:25:12.070]  Everybody else runs around and spends hundreds of dollars for a football jersey.
[03:25:12.490 --> 03:25:13.270]  For a football team?
[03:25:13.410 --> 03:25:14.010]  Okay, fine.
[03:25:14.230 --> 03:25:16.491]  But this is the jersey for Team Humanity.
[03:25:16.731 --> 03:25:17.492]  This really counts.
