[00:00:01.121 --> 00:00:06.926]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:07.988 --> 00:00:14.987]  Visit Infowars.com/show and support the InfoWars.
[00:00:14.987 --> 00:00:34.788]   Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.788 --> 00:00:37.367]  (upbeat music)
[00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:38.899]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:41.679]  Alex will be joining us in five minutes.
[00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:52.702]  I want to update you right now about details that a local officer encountered the gunman before he shot toward Trump at the rally, according to sources who told the AP.
[00:00:54.975 --> 00:01:00.523]  Not long before shots rang out, rally goers noticed a man climbing to the roof of a nearby building and warned local police.
[00:01:00.543 --> 00:01:06.111]  We've seen two separate eyewitness reports, both of which we have aired on this show today.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.462]  One local police officer apparently climbed to the roof and encountered Crooks, who pointed his rifle at the officer.
[00:01:15.042 --> 00:01:28.566]  The officer then retreated down the ladder, and Crooks quickly took a shot toward Trump, and that's when Secret Service snipers shot him, said the officials, who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.
[00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:37.288]  The officials also told AP that bomb-making materials were found inside Crooks' vehicle, which lines right up with Alex Jones predicting that they may use a truck bomb in the next attempt.
[00:01:38.808 --> 00:02:09.778]   So, we've got these updates now that not only did one witness identify that there was a shooter on the roof, not only did a second witness identify that there was a shooter on the roof, but a law enforcement official actually climbed up to the roof, looked at the shooter, apparently the shooter looked at him, therefore the law enforcement official backed away And then proceeded to fire at Trump.
[00:02:10.078 --> 00:02:15.520]  This may explain why this shooter missed the target.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:29.066]  He could have been in a rush to fire at the President because he realized that he had been identified by law enforcement officers and hastily aiming his weapon just was able to skim the ear of the President of the United States.
[00:02:32.264 --> 00:02:45.548]  But the fact of the matter is, it shouldn't be up to one lone police officer climbing up a ladder to just check things out after multiple witnesses have warned repeatedly that someone's on a roof with a rifle.
[00:02:45.768 --> 00:02:49.209]  They should be able to radio and neutralize that threat without any problem.
[00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:54.031]  This is something that was allowed to happen by the deep state through many means.
[00:02:56.172 --> 00:03:09.758]  But like I said, the deep state doesn't have to specifically hire someone and pay them and give them a direct order to assassinate a president in order to be culpable, complicit, or responsible for an assassination attempt on a president of the United States.
[00:03:09.978 --> 00:03:15.440]  They can simply set up the environment that makes it inevitable that such an attempt or attempts will take place.
[00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:23.364]  They do this by doing things like opening the border and allowing tens of millions of people to come in, hundreds of thousands of them from terrorist countries or places of interest.
[00:03:23.644 --> 00:03:38.814]  By doing things like refusing to expand or increase the funding for Secret Service so that the President is more likely to be subjugated to an attack or so that these rallies are more difficult for thin men on the ground to actually case and profile to defend.
[00:03:38.834 --> 00:03:41.236]  This is something that was allowed to happen.
[00:03:41.876 --> 00:04:02.029]   And so as the left comes out over the course of the next several weeks and tries to profile, define, and characterize this shooter as a lone madman pumped up on SSRIs and radicalized because of his involuntary celibacy, We have to totally disregard these notions, disregard these explanations that neutralize
[00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:18.975]  The depths of this, the seriousness of this, the extent of this crime that has been committed not only against Donald Trump, ladies and gentlemen, not only against the former president of the United States or a political candidate, this is a crime that has been committed against the American people.
[00:04:19.015 --> 00:04:24.717]  And as Alex Jones said yesterday, it wasn't just Donald Trump who dodged a bullet yesterday, it was all of us.
[00:04:26.308 --> 00:04:29.911]  So stay tuned as Alex Jones joins us in about a minute and a half.
[00:04:29.951 --> 00:04:34.254]  In the meantime, I want to remind you one more time, please go to InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:58.946]  Before I started working here, I didn't even believe in supplements and I started taking them because they're laying around the office.
[00:04:59.026 --> 00:05:01.327]  I noticed a marked difference in my performance.
[00:05:01.407 --> 00:05:05.608]  I love all the products, both at InfoWarsStore.com and at DrJonesNaturals.com.
[00:05:05.628 --> 00:05:07.189]  That's DrJonesNaturals.com.
[00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:09.469]  Stay tuned for Alex Jones on the other side.
[00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:23.868]  It is July 14th, 2024 on this live Sunday transmission.
[00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:30.834]  I am Alex Jones coming to you live from outside Bohemian Grove.
[00:05:33.515 --> 00:05:36.736]  We got contacted and I was already planning to come here this year.
[00:05:36.776 --> 00:05:41.317]  I meant to go last year and the year before but we got so busy we couldn't go because of court hearings and attacks and everything else.
[00:05:42.038 --> 00:05:45.159]  I wanted to re-infiltrate like I did 24 years ago in July of 2000.
[00:05:46.781 --> 00:05:49.483]  Well, my wife, my family said, please don't infiltrate.
[00:05:49.503 --> 00:05:50.344]  They know what you look like.
[00:05:50.364 --> 00:05:56.708]  I was going to sneak in, climb over the mountain during the night, wait in the dark, and then come out and get the ritual on tape.
[00:05:57.468 --> 00:06:06.515]  Then, right in our lap, we get contacted by a young journalist who organized 20 people getting jobs there and infiltrating.
[00:06:07.035 --> 00:06:09.697]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm like a pygmy trying to eat an elephant right now.
[00:06:10.268 --> 00:06:28.116]  We have seen the most incredible HD footage of the satanic, occultic, druidic ritual going on, and then also the incredible behind-the-scenes behavior where we literally have the Republican establishment talking about how much they hate Trump and them responding to him being shot yesterday and upset that he didn't die.
[00:06:29.317 --> 00:06:37.841]  We have major Republican kingpins that come to this criminal meeting and make all these insider deals, but that's a whole separate subject.
[00:06:38.692 --> 00:06:41.975]  That was my secret mission coming to Northern California.
[00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:49.441]  I got off the airplane, or as we're landing, Rob Dugas, Trump has been shot.
[00:06:50.842 --> 00:06:56.166]  And I got off the airplane and learned all this information.
[00:06:56.466 --> 00:06:59.949]  And I'm getting a beep and a ping, InfoWars Studio, let me know we're live.
[00:06:59.989 --> 00:07:00.449]  Are we good?
[00:07:02.711 --> 00:07:03.432]  All good, okay.
[00:07:04.853 --> 00:07:09.949]   So, I then instantly go look at the footage.
[00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:17.092]  I instantly discover that there was no Secret Service on the rooftops, which is a default unprecedented criminal activity.
[00:07:17.112 --> 00:07:19.974]  This was not failed security.
[00:07:20.074 --> 00:07:21.694]  This was a stand down.
[00:07:22.415 --> 00:07:27.977]  But I want to be one trillion percent clear with everyone.
[00:07:28.458 --> 00:07:42.276]   And when I say this, you heard me with Laura Logan five weeks ago when she was in the studio saying they tried to have A Justice Department appointed official outside of a court order.
[00:07:43.957 --> 00:07:46.018]  Order us closed and shut down.
[00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:47.019]  People didn't believe it.
[00:07:47.499 --> 00:07:49.660]  The next week in court, they admitted it.
[00:07:51.061 --> 00:07:54.563]  They were doing that because I believe they were getting ready to assassinate Trump.
[00:07:55.184 --> 00:07:57.705]  I said it with Laura Logan at least seven times.
[00:07:58.706 --> 00:08:00.767]  The video's been posted at Infowars.com.
[00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:03.929]  And I said it again over and over.
[00:08:06.954 --> 00:08:10.035]  And over and over again just last week.
[00:08:10.135 --> 00:08:18.278]  So when I get up here and I lay this information out, you need to understand I'm not just pulling this out of the, you know, ether.
[00:08:19.178 --> 00:08:21.319]  This is the next globalist move.
[00:08:22.245 --> 00:08:26.130]  Trump has defeated all the lawfare, all the criminal charges, all the fraud.
[00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:27.351]  It's blown up in their face.
[00:08:27.431 --> 00:08:28.633]  Biden's completely collapsed.
[00:08:29.193 --> 00:08:31.216]  And they tried to kill Trump yesterday.
[00:08:31.316 --> 00:08:35.020]  And Forbes and AP and others said, oh, it was an incident.
[00:08:35.441 --> 00:08:38.965]  And even by late last night, they're like, well, it was gunshots.
[00:08:39.545 --> 00:08:40.767]  No, Trump was shot.
[00:08:41.545 --> 00:08:45.007]  In the ear, went right through his ear, made a perfect hole.
[00:08:45.247 --> 00:08:49.089]  These idiot leftists are going, well, it would have blown his head off if this big bullet hit him.
[00:08:49.309 --> 00:08:51.290]  And they show the whole cartridge and the round.
[00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:53.431]  No, that doesn't fire the whole thing.
[00:08:54.272 --> 00:09:00.195]  Like when the left's been caught framing people, they'll throw out whole, unspent cartridges and act like that was shot through a gun.
[00:09:00.855 --> 00:09:09.800]  The left's been caught before sticking whole bullets and cartridges in holes, in walls, and saying, look, this bullet fired into here, and it's the whole cartridge.
[00:09:10.862 --> 00:09:11.822]  That's how dumb they are.
[00:09:12.022 --> 00:09:15.783]  So, they literally tried to kill Trump.
[00:09:16.143 --> 00:09:21.784]  It's just like they did with RFK Jr., giving him no Secret Service when his dad and uncle were murdered by the Deep State.
[00:09:22.704 --> 00:09:25.085]  He has less than 20 Secret Service agents.
[00:09:25.705 --> 00:09:29.526]  But whoever the advance team was, let's get this on record, this is not up for debate.
[00:09:30.786 --> 00:09:31.826]  Everybody's just debating this.
[00:09:32.206 --> 00:09:33.226]  It's a closed case.
[00:09:33.246 --> 00:09:34.847]  450 feet away are four buildings.
[00:09:37.683 --> 00:09:44.770]  And you would have, even if there's not a lot of Secret Service, they would put police on top of those buildings.
[00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:45.591]  You do not.
[00:09:45.891 --> 00:09:47.253]  That's where shooters come from.
[00:09:47.553 --> 00:09:48.594]  That's the number one threat.
[00:09:48.994 --> 00:09:51.677]  In basic Secret Service training, it's on record.
[00:09:51.737 --> 00:09:54.700]  So, they were ordered by the advance team to not be on the roofs.
[00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:58.500]  This person has MKUltra written all over him.
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.862]  They start clearing people out minutes before behind Trump, and they know a shooter's on top of the roof.
[00:10:03.422 --> 00:10:04.403]  They admit that happened.
[00:10:04.443 --> 00:10:08.505]  Witnesses, dozens of them on TV, saw the guy with the gun, said, hey, there's a guy with a gun, a guy with a gun.
[00:10:08.765 --> 00:10:17.810]  This went on for minutes, and the police, the locals, have got their guns on him, trying to get the green light to shoot him, and they were told stand down.
[00:10:18.911 --> 00:10:22.741]   Only after the shooting failed, The assassination failed to do this.
[00:10:22.781 --> 00:10:31.388]  So they're trying to get us to only talk about ballistics and the shooter and the Secret Service and investigation and Congress.
[00:10:31.809 --> 00:10:37.814]  That is a total and complete diversion from the real issue.
[00:10:38.794 --> 00:10:41.417]  I told you the Deep State's only move is to kill Trump.
[00:10:41.957 --> 00:10:46.841]  Kennedy in 63 ordered 100,000 of the US troops and the 500,000 back.
[00:10:47.502 --> 00:10:49.623]  They were on ships and planes back to the US.
[00:10:49.683 --> 00:10:55.126]   There was Another $400,000 he was going to bring back within one month.
[00:10:55.867 --> 00:10:58.508]  Within one month of him giving that order.
[00:11:02.139 --> 00:11:05.081]  He was shot in the head in Dallas, Texas.
[00:11:05.121 --> 00:11:09.645]  And I said, when Trump said two weeks ago, I want the dying to stop, I'll end the war again.
[00:11:09.705 --> 00:11:11.626]  I said, they're going to try to kill Trump.
[00:11:11.866 --> 00:11:12.787]  That's the trajectory.
[00:11:13.187 --> 00:11:20.613]  Fake impeachments, Russia gave, all the lawfare, all the civil suits, all the criminal rig courts, building up to that.
[00:11:20.813 --> 00:11:24.536]  On their trajectory, next is assassination.
[00:11:24.636 --> 00:11:28.279]  So now, on the trajectory, we've now reached attempted assassination.
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.642]  This follows a threat escalation ladder.
[00:11:30.702 --> 00:11:34.785]  It's been well studied for hundreds of years, scientifically thousands of years known in history.
[00:11:35.646 --> 00:11:41.651]  What is the next thing when you fail a coup attempt and you're in a live attempted coup against the people?
[00:11:42.852 --> 00:11:46.795]  You double down and try to kill Trump and he's going to Milwaukee.
[00:11:48.196 --> 00:11:49.257]  They're going to try to truck bomb him.
[00:11:49.818 --> 00:11:53.659]  And when I was at the RNC in 2016, we had Secret Service, Highest Level Contacts and others.
[00:11:54.519 --> 00:11:58.081]  They had stolen dump trucks they believe were loaded with explosives.
[00:11:58.221 --> 00:11:59.461]  I broke this before it was in the news.
[00:11:59.841 --> 00:12:02.162]  That's why they shut down all the roads for a half mile out.
[00:12:02.762 --> 00:12:06.063]  They've got to shut down the roads because they're going to try to truck bomb Trump.
[00:12:07.248 --> 00:12:08.509]  And they're going to try to assassinate him.
[00:12:08.529 --> 00:12:11.210]  And they've also got operatives inside Mar-a-Lago.
[00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:13.311]  They've also got operatives inside his operation.
[00:12:13.351 --> 00:12:14.491]  You better bet your bottom dollar.
[00:12:14.831 --> 00:12:16.392]  They are going to try to poison Trump.
[00:12:16.452 --> 00:12:17.233]  That's their best move.
[00:12:17.513 --> 00:12:19.394]  So Trump's at the greatest danger of poisoning.
[00:12:19.714 --> 00:12:21.334]  They claim he dies of a heart attack or a stroke.
[00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:24.556]  Next is a truck bomb, or they'll shoot him if they can.
[00:12:25.016 --> 00:12:26.897]  This is not speculation.
[00:12:26.937 --> 00:12:29.118]  They train everyone to be journalists.
[00:12:29.947 --> 00:12:34.248]  And to never know anything, just argue little minutia.
[00:12:34.288 --> 00:12:36.049]  The Deep State said they'd kill Trump.
[00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:38.410]  The Deep State said this was their operation.
[00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:40.770]  The Deep State said they were going to remove him.
[00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:42.751]  They have nothing else to do.
[00:12:42.791 --> 00:12:46.812]  They just shot the Slovakian president a month and a half ago, five times he lived.
[00:12:47.893 --> 00:12:49.473]  They're going to try to kill Viktor Orban.
[00:12:49.533 --> 00:12:50.914]  That is a no-brainer.
[00:12:51.174 --> 00:12:58.956]  And if somebody shoots Orban, or kills Orban, or Orban's plane blows up, it's the Deep State, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:59.585 --> 00:13:02.667]  My God, I mean, it's a 99% chance.
[00:13:03.067 --> 00:13:15.194]  And by admitting they're the ones behind it, by admitting they have the motive, by admitting this is going on, is the only way to stop them by acting like adults and saying we're done debating.
[00:13:15.695 --> 00:13:17.676]  Remember all the decades of articles in the New York Times?
[00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:19.297]  Jones claims there's a new world order.
[00:13:19.697 --> 00:13:21.418]  Jones claims there's a world government.
[00:13:22.538 --> 00:13:24.539]  And now they admit the world government's out in the open.
[00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:31.483]  They would debate us about whether the world government existed or not while world leaders were announcing their world government.
[00:13:31.743 --> 00:13:36.505]  So they keep you in this limbo like they're the officials, like they're the authority, like they're the boss.
[00:13:36.905 --> 00:13:42.988]  And you have this discussion with them about whether the whole homosexual movement is about depopulation.
[00:13:43.048 --> 00:13:43.709]  They admit it is.
[00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:47.991]  Or whether drag queen story time is about normalizing pedophilia to destroy families.
[00:13:48.511 --> 00:13:49.993]  We know their agenda.
[00:13:50.313 --> 00:13:51.594]  Stop debating them.
[00:13:52.715 --> 00:13:53.756]  Stop arguing with them.
[00:13:53.776 --> 00:13:55.077]  You know, I used to hear this from Ted Nugent.
[00:13:55.097 --> 00:13:56.138]  I've known him 20-something years.
[00:13:56.178 --> 00:13:56.919]  Great guy, good friend.
[00:13:57.479 --> 00:14:00.662]  He'd be like, Alex, you don't worry about a rabid dog while it's trying to bite your kid.
[00:14:01.303 --> 00:14:05.707]  You don't sit there and have debates about why it's rabbit or what possum bit it or what raccoon.
[00:14:06.067 --> 00:14:06.848]  You kill it.
[00:14:07.068 --> 00:14:08.609]  And I'm not saying physically kill them.
[00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:15.575]  I'm saying, once you know, you don't need to be a doctor or a veterinarian or a biologist or a virologist.
[00:14:15.975 --> 00:14:27.585]  When you open your back door and there is a raccoon foaming at the mouth trying to attack your Labrador retriever, you know it's got rabies and you call animal control or you shoot it.
[00:14:28.678 --> 00:14:30.620]  So that's an analogy of what we're dealing with.
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:41.452]  We have a foaming at the mouth Cujo deep state that is completely psychotic and out of control and you know the next thing was assassination.
[00:14:41.792 --> 00:14:48.159]  And then I told you years ago, lawfare, criminal indictments, fake convictions, impeachments, and then assassination.
[00:14:49.306 --> 00:14:56.571]  And then I harped on it, and I harped on it, and I harped on it, and I harped on it, and I said if they fail the assassination, they're gonna try it again.
[00:14:56.611 --> 00:15:01.075]  But if they were able to kill him yesterday, they would have claimed the Russians launched a cyber attack.
[00:15:01.095 --> 00:15:03.396]  And they would have cut off most of the internet.
[00:15:03.777 --> 00:15:06.819]  And then suddenly you'd hear Tucker Carlson died in his hotel room.
[00:15:08.125 --> 00:15:08.465]  Okay?
[00:15:08.725 --> 00:15:11.226]  You would have heard, oh my god, did you hear?
[00:15:11.246 --> 00:15:12.907]  You know, this person got killed.
[00:15:12.967 --> 00:15:14.769]  Oh, Alex Jones got killed by a carjacker.
[00:15:15.109 --> 00:15:17.390]  They don't care about plausibility.
[00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:19.591]  They don't care about deniability.
[00:15:19.952 --> 00:15:21.333]  They don't care about that now.
[00:15:21.393 --> 00:15:22.153]  They're cornered.
[00:15:22.453 --> 00:15:23.574]  They're going for broke.
[00:15:23.954 --> 00:15:24.975]  This is where we are.
[00:15:24.995 --> 00:15:27.456]  This is why they wanted us off the air five weeks ago.
[00:15:27.476 --> 00:15:32.679]  Why they tried four times in federal court to shut us down because this is it.
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:34.060]  This is the big one.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.501]  How many times?
[00:15:35.581 --> 00:15:36.862]  And I know the Archivist did a great job.
[00:15:37.699 --> 00:15:40.104]  He went back, you know, eight years ago and he said it was SSA Trump.
[00:15:40.926 --> 00:15:42.308]  Get the Laura Logan interview.
[00:15:42.429 --> 00:15:43.812]  Get the ones from last week.
[00:15:44.373 --> 00:15:46.557]  This isn't me six years ago saying this, eight years ago.
[00:15:46.818 --> 00:15:48.862]  This is me specifically saying.
[00:15:49.938 --> 00:15:58.263]  The only move they have left is the assassination of President Trump.
[00:15:58.663 --> 00:16:01.945]  And then out of that, they would then truck bomb black colleges.
[00:16:02.245 --> 00:16:04.546]  They would then truck bomb black schools.
[00:16:04.926 --> 00:16:10.509]  They would then truck bomb to say Trump supporters strike back and blow up black college.
[00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:12.410]  It has no bearing on reality.
[00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:15.632]  It doesn't make sense, but that will change the story.
[00:16:15.932 --> 00:16:17.153]  A bunch of dead black kids.
[00:16:17.513 --> 00:16:23.650]   So I'm telling you right now, They're going to hit a black college, they're going to hit a black grocery store.
[00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:34.660]  Remember two years ago when they shot up that black grocery store in Buffalo and people got blown away that I said it a month before, they're going to shoot up a black grocery store.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.862]  Because it's all in the FBI training manuals.
[00:16:38.263 --> 00:16:46.310]  The National Directive of Obama, June 2021, says white supremacy is the number one crime in America, when it doesn't even exist.
[00:16:47.502 --> 00:16:49.243]  When it comes to violence, it sure exists on the internet.
[00:16:49.263 --> 00:16:51.524]  There are people that believe that stuff, but the point is they're not out there doing stuff.
[00:16:52.084 --> 00:16:53.865]  And I said they would do that, and it happened.
[00:16:54.125 --> 00:16:54.606]  I'm telling you.
[00:16:55.626 --> 00:16:56.987]  They're going to truck bomb Mar-a-Lago.
[00:16:57.007 --> 00:17:00.388]  They're going to try to truck bomb Milwaukee.
[00:17:00.788 --> 00:17:04.370]  They're going to truck bomb a black college or black megachurch.
[00:17:05.511 --> 00:17:08.472]  And I'm telling you, that's their next move.
[00:17:09.313 --> 00:17:27.246]   And if Trump gets elected in 113 days, that's 79 days between him being elected and him Him being the candidate, and that information going down, that is the real time they're gonna launch a race war in America that is not real.
[00:17:27.907 --> 00:17:33.809]  So, when a black guy goes in some Alabama white church and kills 50 people, folks, that's staged.
[00:17:34.149 --> 00:17:42.593]  When some lunatic white guy goes and supposedly blows up or firebombs or shoots a bunch of black people, come on folks, you're smarter than that.
[00:17:43.351 --> 00:17:47.356]  We can get ahead of this right now, but you've got to listen to me.
[00:17:47.697 --> 00:17:49.379]  You've got to understand what I'm saying.
[00:17:49.659 --> 00:17:52.723]  You've got to take it in and know this is what I do for 30 years.
[00:17:52.983 --> 00:17:57.669]  This is all I do, 24-7, inside of this, attacked by the enemy.
[00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:01.274]  And I knew when they tried to shut me down outside of court order, completely criminal.
[00:18:01.997 --> 00:18:06.300]  That they've been greenlit by intelligence agencies to do that, and it came out later in court.
[00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:12.225]  They were ordered, quote, by the Sandy Hook families that are really controlling them, the FBI, that came out in court.
[00:18:12.645 --> 00:18:22.193]  So the FBI ordered, through the Justice Department, the federally appointed official, in my high-profile bankruptcy, to shut us down five weeks ago.
[00:18:22.853 --> 00:18:26.096]  And they failed because the judge was appointed by Trump and fired them.
[00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:27.877]  Do you understand that?
[00:18:28.437 --> 00:18:30.339]  Do you understand this wasn't about me?
[00:18:30.499 --> 00:18:31.700]  Do you understand me?
[00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:34.460]  I need you to listen to me.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:43.243]  I need you to understand that everybody's like, oh, Trump's gonna win now, oh, the deep state's screwed, oh, the New World Order's in a lot of trouble, they don't know what to do.
[00:18:43.824 --> 00:18:45.244]  No, no, no, no.
[00:18:45.304 --> 00:18:49.726]  Just like the wolf says in Pulp Fiction, we don't need to start sucking each other's dicks yet.
[00:18:50.386 --> 00:18:59.129]  Because, I'm sorry to use that French, but it's true, people need to get their heads screwed on straight and understand that intellectually I've never been this concerned.
[00:19:00.149 --> 00:19:04.992]  And spiritually, I've never felt this much danger because we are winning.
[00:19:05.592 --> 00:19:07.873]  And we're turning the tide of Satan with God's help.
[00:19:08.394 --> 00:19:11.055]  And their whole plan is falling and they're cornered.
[00:19:11.455 --> 00:19:14.297]  What do you think they're going to do?
[00:19:14.557 --> 00:19:15.978]  They're going to false flag.
[00:19:16.578 --> 00:19:18.039]  And Trump is badass.
[00:19:18.639 --> 00:19:19.240]  He's amazing.
[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.120]  So proud to support him.
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:28.347]   But he is going to march off to that inauguration or to that Nomination, which leads to his inauguration.
[00:19:28.727 --> 00:19:32.089]  And I get it, because if he doesn't, it looks weak, and they may still attack it.
[00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:36.832]  But the point is, is that it's fine to be there because they can scream people going in.
[00:19:37.913 --> 00:19:40.735]  But they've got to block the roads at least a half mile away.
[00:19:41.195 --> 00:19:54.750]   Because ladies and gentlemen, if you don't think the New World Order is willing to start World War III with Russia, If you don't think they're not willing to set off a low-yield nuclear weapon to get rid of Trump in Milwaukee, I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[00:19:54.830 --> 00:20:00.133]  I'm saying that's a card in the deep state's hand and all the missing nukes from Minot that Cheney stole.
[00:20:00.593 --> 00:20:03.275]  And if you don't think these scumbags won't do it, you're crazy.
[00:20:03.315 --> 00:20:05.636]  And that's why you've got to think like the enemy.
[00:20:05.996 --> 00:20:07.637]  You've got to admit the full horror.
[00:20:08.217 --> 00:20:09.778]  You've got to get your head in the game.
[00:20:10.178 --> 00:20:12.039]  You've got to understand what's going on.
[00:20:12.419 --> 00:20:14.980]  And you've got to get this information out.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.457]   Because let me tell you, I've been on Ten shows last, you know, 18 hours or so.
[00:20:19.477 --> 00:20:22.161]  It's like off the airplane, 20 hours, whatever it was.
[00:20:23.022 --> 00:20:31.713]  And I love him to death, but it's all about the shooter and the FBI and the Secret Service and the how bullet trajectories and blah blah.
[00:20:31.793 --> 00:20:32.394]  It's done!
[00:20:33.246 --> 00:20:34.867]  They ordered a stand down.
[00:20:35.287 --> 00:20:39.170]  It's default to be on the roof, half mile out at water towers.
[00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:43.113]  When the president or the top candidate speaks, they go, people in the water tower.
[00:20:43.413 --> 00:20:47.996]  Because most shooters don't show up and get through the metal detectors and shoot a president up front.
[00:20:48.937 --> 00:20:50.058]  They don't do it at 20 feet away.
[00:20:50.138 --> 00:20:52.539]  They do it at 500 yards away.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.960]  This guy wasn't 500 yards.
[00:20:55.396 --> 00:21:06.440]  This guy was 150 yards, he was 450 feet, and he did this, and then once he did his shots and he failed, then the Patsy was taken out.
[00:21:07.101 --> 00:21:08.981]  All of it was pre-prepared.
[00:21:09.082 --> 00:21:11.402]  The average Secret Service or police on the ground were told, don't shoot.
[00:21:11.442 --> 00:21:13.443]  You see them like, we got him, we got him, we got him, we got him.
[00:21:13.743 --> 00:21:14.144]  No, no, no.
[00:21:14.244 --> 00:21:16.044]  Everyone's like, shooter, shooter, guy with a gun.
[00:21:16.324 --> 00:21:16.945]  He's up there.
[00:21:17.385 --> 00:21:19.286]  You saw them do this.
[00:21:20.046 --> 00:21:22.627]  You saw them, so we already know that.
[00:21:23.945 --> 00:21:24.866]  There's a computer attack.
[00:21:24.906 --> 00:21:25.806]  I'm not really a computer person.
[00:21:25.866 --> 00:21:27.167]  We've been under their attacks many times.
[00:21:27.527 --> 00:21:28.508]  Some of my computer guys tell me about it.
[00:21:28.528 --> 00:21:29.788]  It's called a slow Loris attack.
[00:21:30.749 --> 00:21:31.629]  We go on for 30 years.
[00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:33.970]  And they got newer modern versions of it.
[00:21:34.491 --> 00:21:38.133]  But it's where a computer doesn't try to break into your computer.
[00:21:38.153 --> 00:21:40.774]  It puts its hand out for you to shake its hand.
[00:21:42.055 --> 00:21:44.116]  And your computer is designed to take information.
[00:21:44.356 --> 00:21:47.658]  So even if your computer has software that blocks hacking, it still puts a hand out.
[00:21:48.338 --> 00:21:52.643]   So when it puts its hand out, It's that thing where you put your hand and you go, ooh, not gonna shake your hand.
[00:21:53.123 --> 00:21:57.786]  And it just keeps, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[00:21:58.906 --> 00:22:04.149]  And that's what they're doing when they get us into a debate about what'll happen to the Secret Service.
[00:22:04.389 --> 00:22:06.190]  Will there be a congressional investigation?
[00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:09.111]  Or will there be drones to protect him next time?
[00:22:09.551 --> 00:22:15.534]  You put police and security forces on the goddamn rooftops.
[00:22:16.286 --> 00:22:17.546]  That's what you do.
[00:22:17.566 --> 00:22:29.049]  It'd be like, again, I use the gross analogy, which I would never do, but let's just say a father has a newborn baby, and you live on the edge of a cliff, and you walk out and you throw the baby off a cliff and your neighbors see you do it.
[00:22:29.349 --> 00:22:31.670]  You didn't accidentally throw it off a cliff.
[00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:33.790]  You didn't have a lapse in parenthood.
[00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:35.311]  You weren't forgetful.
[00:22:35.351 --> 00:22:40.412]  You threw the baby off the cliff, or it's like taking a newborn baby and dropping it in your swimming pool.
[00:22:42.025 --> 00:22:46.309]  You didn't accidentally, it's not manslaughter, it's murder one, you murdered it.
[00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:50.433]  And you know this has come out that his security's been completely off.
[00:22:51.294 --> 00:22:56.139]  It's the advance team sent by Obama that says, yeah, we're not putting anybody on these roofs.
[00:22:58.021 --> 00:22:59.903]  We're not putting anybody on these roofs at 450 feet away.
[00:23:01.886 --> 00:23:07.811]  And I saw the apologist all over the shows I was on, and all over the programs I was on, on X, you name it.
[00:23:08.151 --> 00:23:11.174]  Oh, there'll be an investigation, don't worry, this is quite normal, no big deal.
[00:23:11.634 --> 00:23:12.475]  No, it's not.
[00:23:12.515 --> 00:23:16.859]  The fact that they had their people so ready, and the fact that they said that Trump, remember?
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:22.844]  He was just an incident, Forbes and AP, there might have been, maybe a backfire happened.
[00:23:23.204 --> 00:23:30.210]  As of 8 o'clock last night, Pacific, 10 o'clock Central, 11 o'clock Eastern, they were still calling it an incident.
[00:23:30.896 --> 00:23:33.077]  Because they failed to kill him.
[00:23:33.337 --> 00:23:35.038]  They're coming for you.
[00:23:35.518 --> 00:23:36.199]  This is it.
[00:23:36.759 --> 00:23:38.320]  The CIA runs coups all over the world.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.300]  Look at what they're willing to do.
[00:23:40.701 --> 00:23:41.661]  What do you think you're going to do here?
[00:23:42.662 --> 00:23:46.463]  Now, we're going to go to break here in a few minutes, and I meant to tell the crew this.
[00:23:46.523 --> 00:23:48.044]  It'll go to infowarestore.com.
[00:23:48.464 --> 00:23:49.865]  It's being printed right now in Texas.
[00:23:50.685 --> 00:23:52.806]  We have the Trump bulletproof shirt.
[00:23:54.087 --> 00:24:00.676]   That is an image posterized of Trump With the American flag behind him saying bulletproof, InfoWars.com.
[00:24:01.096 --> 00:24:01.997]  We need funds.
[00:24:02.497 --> 00:24:03.578]  We're going to stay on air.
[00:24:03.978 --> 00:24:08.240]  We could have been shut down the last month, but we have a path forward, but we've got to be profitable.
[00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:10.641]  And the judges blocked them shutting us down.
[00:24:11.462 --> 00:24:15.404]  And then the whole liquidation process leads to a sale and a reorganization.
[00:24:15.684 --> 00:24:24.729]  So I need you to go to InfoWarsStore.com and get the Trump bulletproof shirt.
[00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:29.214]  It is so powerful and it is a fundraiser shirt.
[00:24:29.235 --> 00:24:30.876]  It's made on high quality fabric and everything.
[00:24:30.896 --> 00:24:33.960]  So the shirt costs us like $10 for the shirt and $3 to print it.
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.304]  So we're making like, you know, 12 bucks or something.
[00:24:37.364 --> 00:24:38.525]  We need the funds.
[00:24:38.746 --> 00:24:42.230]  I need you in this fight to give donations to Trump.
[00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:42.910]  He's going to win now.
[00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:43.511]  Just keep him alive.
[00:24:43.551 --> 00:24:44.112]  That's the key thing.
[00:24:44.699 --> 00:24:51.363]  But to go to InfoWarsTore.com and support the people that support President Trump, and a big sale's going on the site right now.

[00:25:35.568 --> 00:25:37.350]  It's not a stimulant, but it has a bigger effect than that.
[00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:37.890]  It's incredible.
[00:25:38.211 --> 00:25:39.291]  Next Level Financial Energy.
[00:25:39.552 --> 00:25:40.693]  There's the CabaChill.
[00:25:40.733 --> 00:25:42.514]  There's the Top Brain.
[00:25:42.534 --> 00:25:43.475]  Incredible Nootropic.
[00:25:43.515 --> 00:25:44.616]  There's the great SleepAid.
[00:25:44.676 --> 00:25:45.197]  RocketRest.
[00:25:45.617 --> 00:25:46.418]  It's all there.
[00:25:46.578 --> 00:25:48.179]  Decide to fight with us.
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:55.125]  Go to drjonesnaturals.com if you want to continue us in this fight to be out here on the ground.
[00:25:55.506 --> 00:25:56.387]  Take it on the New World Order.
[00:25:56.667 --> 00:25:57.508]  drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:25:57.628 --> 00:26:00.230]  And again, I came out here to Northern California.
[00:26:01.169 --> 00:26:03.030]  Because I was already going to cover this.
[00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:04.351]  My wife's got friends here.
[00:26:04.391 --> 00:26:05.932]  She came with me with my youngest daughter.
[00:26:06.853 --> 00:26:09.814]  And, you know, two years in a row I canceled coming out here.
[00:26:09.834 --> 00:26:12.736]  And she said, I really want to go see my friend Jordana.
[00:26:12.756 --> 00:26:15.378]  And I said, sweetheart, I'm going to go to Bohemian Grove this year.
[00:26:15.398 --> 00:26:16.038]  We'll go in July.
[00:26:17.699 --> 00:26:18.560]  She didn't want me to sneak in.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.100]  I was going to do it.
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:27.045]  Then we get contacted by a group of 20 young journalists, young people from around the country that had gotten jobs at Bohemian Grove and had decided to expose it.
[00:26:27.768 --> 00:26:35.913]  I met with them this morning and saw the incredible footage of the occult rituals and bizarre behavior going on and the Republicans attacking Trump and hating him.
[00:26:36.154 --> 00:26:37.835]  And they're going to be on with us in the next hour.
[00:26:38.135 --> 00:26:42.458]  So this is huge and you're going to see exclusive HD footage that is incredible.
[00:26:42.878 --> 00:26:44.299]  They shot on their phones and more.
[00:26:45.139 --> 00:26:46.380]  We talked to people who got arrested.
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:47.401]  They confiscated their footage.
[00:26:47.781 --> 00:26:51.203]  The joke's on the New World Order because 18 of them got the footage out.
[00:26:51.684 --> 00:26:52.384]  Eighteen of them.
[00:26:52.404 --> 00:26:53.705]  I met with like nine of them this morning.
[00:26:54.606 --> 00:26:56.467]  So their intimidation isn't working.
[00:26:57.316 --> 00:26:58.137]  It's all coming out.
[00:26:58.717 --> 00:27:02.399]  Massive Bohemian Grove footage will be uploaded on X in the next hour.
[00:27:02.819 --> 00:27:04.500]  We'll have it here for you by Saturday Night Live.
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:07.722]  Tonight with Chase Geyser, Harrison Smith, Owen Troyer and more.
[00:27:08.122 --> 00:27:08.923]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:27:08.963 --> 00:27:13.985]  Go to drjonesnaturals.com and back to Second American Revolution worldwide.
[00:27:14.045 --> 00:27:15.066]  We are proving ourselves.
[00:27:15.686 --> 00:27:16.747]  Are you not empowered?
[00:27:17.147 --> 00:27:18.708]  Are you not enthused?
[00:27:18.828 --> 00:27:21.310]  Are you not entertained like he says in Gladiator?
[00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:22.430]  We'll be right back.

[00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:51.110]   DrJonesNaturals.com Alright, I'm gonna explain this again to everybody.
[00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:52.830]  I've been on air 30 years.
[00:28:55.191 --> 00:29:01.014]  I had family involved at high levels in Iran-Contra and they taught me everything I know.
[00:29:02.512 --> 00:29:07.734]  And I knew all the top FBI and CIA and Pentagon people that fought the New World Order.
[00:29:07.754 --> 00:29:08.274]  I knew them all.
[00:29:08.294 --> 00:29:09.515]  All of them.
[00:29:10.315 --> 00:29:11.116]  And they taught everything I know.
[00:29:12.096 --> 00:29:12.316]  Okay?
[00:29:12.576 --> 00:29:19.719]  So I've been on air 30 years, and I am the expert recognized on this issue of globalist coup against America.
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:20.540]  Okay?
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:24.981]  So I'm going to tell you very slowly again, I'm going to tell Trump and everybody else this, don't play around with this.
[00:29:25.942 --> 00:29:32.745]   Trump has to come out and directly attack the deep state for this and Biden cutting his Secret Service.
[00:29:33.146 --> 00:29:34.287]  And them not putting people on the roof.
[00:29:34.327 --> 00:29:35.147]  That's bare minimum.
[00:29:35.187 --> 00:29:36.128]  He's gotta attack that now.
[00:29:36.889 --> 00:29:41.953]  And he's gotta understand now that now that they've tried to kill him, they have nothing to lose.
[00:29:42.173 --> 00:29:45.475]  Everybody that has a brain knows the Deep State did this.
[00:29:46.956 --> 00:29:49.879]  So we shouldn't sit here like children and debate whether they were behind it or not.
[00:29:49.899 --> 00:29:52.681]  Does a bear take a dump in the woods?
[00:29:53.802 --> 00:29:54.522]  Is the ocean wet?
[00:29:55.743 --> 00:29:57.224]  Do bluebirds fly in the sky?
[00:29:58.005 --> 00:30:00.227]  Is the sun in the sky during the day?
[00:30:01.688 --> 00:30:01.908]  Okay?
[00:30:03.004 --> 00:30:04.905]  We're not playing games here.
[00:30:04.925 --> 00:30:08.526]  I'm not doing this show just for entertainment.
[00:30:08.866 --> 00:30:10.447]  I'm not doing it to lose.
[00:30:10.547 --> 00:30:11.488]  I'm doing it to win.
[00:30:12.108 --> 00:30:13.728]  And I told you this was coming.
[00:30:14.229 --> 00:30:16.069]  So I'm going to say it very slowly.
[00:30:16.089 --> 00:30:17.170]  And I'm not just talking to the audience.
[00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:19.491]  I'm talking to Trump.
[00:30:19.511 --> 00:30:21.992]  And I'm talking to the globalists.
[00:30:23.472 --> 00:30:24.473]  Trump needs to know this.
[00:30:24.533 --> 00:30:25.173]  He's not stupid.
[00:30:25.193 --> 00:30:25.533]  He does.
[00:30:25.553 --> 00:30:28.034]  But the globalists need to know.
[00:30:28.194 --> 00:30:31.796]  I've looked at every possible outcome and permutation of this.
[00:30:32.435 --> 00:30:39.717]  And only if they start a nuclear war and kill most of the planet, and live in bunkers for 10 years, will they emerge and be in control after this.
[00:30:39.797 --> 00:30:41.917]  And they're going to lose that too, because people know where their bunkers are.
[00:30:42.697 --> 00:30:47.078]  And even if they kill 80% of us, the other billion people are going to go kill them.
[00:30:48.058 --> 00:30:59.401]  So, the bunkers in Kauai, both the military bunkers and Zuckerberg's, and the bunkers in Australia and New Zealand, the bunkers up in Canada, are where the food's at.
[00:31:00.201 --> 00:31:00.901]  You're not safe.
[00:31:01.846 --> 00:31:03.026]  There are a list of your bunkers.
[00:31:03.667 --> 00:31:04.507]  We know who you are.
[00:31:04.847 --> 00:31:06.768]  We know the security people that built your bunkers.
[00:31:08.528 --> 00:31:09.829]  You need to give up right now.
[00:31:10.089 --> 00:31:10.849]  You have lost.
[00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:12.710]  Everything's turning against you.
[00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:13.850]  Everyone hates you.
[00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:16.131]  There's no putting the genie back in the bottle.
[00:31:16.431 --> 00:31:18.451]  There's no getting the cows back in the barn.
[00:31:19.372 --> 00:31:19.812]  It's over.
[00:31:21.432 --> 00:31:28.915]  The only hope you've got is to sue for peace and we will let you like Napoleon go into abstentia.
[00:31:29.893 --> 00:31:32.235]  Literally, sticking your ass on nylon somewhere.
[00:31:33.015 --> 00:31:34.696]  Because we don't value your life.
[00:31:35.296 --> 00:31:37.278]  We don't want to hurt our lives to get you.
[00:31:38.038 --> 00:31:43.221]  You can take some of your stolen money and take your disgusting families, and you can get the fuck out of our lives.
[00:31:43.782 --> 00:31:44.042]  Okay?
[00:31:44.322 --> 00:31:46.063]  But listen, I don't know how to quit.
[00:31:46.683 --> 00:31:47.744]  I don't know how to back down.
[00:31:48.104 --> 00:31:49.125]  I don't know how to give in.
[00:31:50.065 --> 00:31:51.266]  I've got a problem.
[00:31:52.087 --> 00:31:54.188]  Some big guy pushes me.
[00:31:54.958 --> 00:31:59.421]  Or some big guy tries to intimidate me, I climb their ass, and I beat their brains out.
[00:31:59.621 --> 00:32:00.421]  Or I die trying.
[00:32:00.961 --> 00:32:04.663]  And believe me, I've been in comas, I've had my leg broken, I've had my ass kicked.
[00:32:04.723 --> 00:32:05.404]  There's better men.
[00:32:05.744 --> 00:32:08.866]  I don't claim I'm the biggest, baddest son of a bitch you ever met.
[00:32:09.426 --> 00:32:10.307]  But let me tell you something.
[00:32:11.147 --> 00:32:18.291]  If you're looking for a fight, and you start one with me, and you get a lickin' on my ass, you're gonna turn loose the devil.
[00:32:18.711 --> 00:32:22.333]  And you're gonna find out, real fast, what it is to get attacked.
[00:32:23.414 --> 00:32:32.489]   So, I don't use that as some metaphor for violence, because we're winning the information war, and I'm not threatening violence, because that's the resource of losers.
[00:32:33.169 --> 00:32:38.052]  But I'll tell you people something right now, and you know you can put it in the bag, that's why you don't like me.
[00:32:40.253 --> 00:32:41.634]  You fucked with the wrong people.
[00:32:43.054 --> 00:32:46.796]  And you may have put most people in a coma, but you didn't put all of us in a coma.
[00:32:47.557 --> 00:32:48.437]  Your ass is beat.
[00:32:49.978 --> 00:32:54.419]   So, there's dog crap in my backyard, I don't go out and stomp on it because I hate it.
[00:32:54.439 --> 00:32:55.900]  I go scoop it up and put it in a trash can.
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:58.480]  I'm going to put your ass in a trash can.
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:03.241]  I don't want to stomp on you because you don't have any value for me.
[00:33:03.441 --> 00:33:05.041]  You know, they say hate is the opposite of love.
[00:33:05.081 --> 00:33:05.421]  It's not.
[00:33:06.101 --> 00:33:07.542]  Indifference is the opposite of love.
[00:33:08.122 --> 00:33:09.562]  I'm indifferent to you.
[00:33:10.702 --> 00:33:11.702]  I love people.
[00:33:11.842 --> 00:33:12.743]  I love humanity.
[00:33:13.103 --> 00:33:14.463]  I love the smell of life.
[00:33:15.183 --> 00:33:16.163]  I'm a fan of humanity.
[00:33:17.463 --> 00:33:18.644]  And you people aren't.
[00:33:19.284 --> 00:33:20.824]  So let me give you a little news flash.
[00:33:22.543 --> 00:33:23.844]  Let me give you a little newsflash.
[00:33:25.005 --> 00:33:27.767]  I've looked at every possible angle of this.
[00:33:27.787 --> 00:33:28.848]  That's what my brain's good at.
[00:33:29.408 --> 00:33:30.469]  And our listeners are smart, too.
[00:33:30.509 --> 00:33:31.029]  They can see it.
[00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:36.333]  There isn't one scenario where you guys end up not dead.
[00:33:37.654 --> 00:33:40.757]  Except running up the white flag.
[00:33:42.478 --> 00:33:44.920]  You only care about power and control and playing God.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:46.201]  That's your weakness.
[00:33:47.181 --> 00:33:48.142]  I already know there's a God.
[00:33:49.303 --> 00:33:50.264]  So I'm trying to play God.
[00:33:50.764 --> 00:33:51.985]  I'm trying to get in alignment with God.
[00:33:52.751 --> 00:33:55.132]  I'm gonna tell you real slow, so you can hear me.
[00:33:56.053 --> 00:33:56.533]  You're beaten.
[00:33:58.234 --> 00:33:58.755]  You're lost.
[00:33:59.995 --> 00:34:00.416]  It's over.
[00:34:01.596 --> 00:34:05.959]  I've been on Earth 30 years, and I never came to the point of telling you you're 100% done.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:13.283]  On this day, on this Sunday broadcast, I'm telling you to your face right now, you failed.
[00:34:14.724 --> 00:34:20.348]  And you'll never get us to back down, and we got your name, we got your number, we got your ass.
[00:34:22.751 --> 00:34:24.833]  No, I don't like stomping on dog crap.
[00:34:26.554 --> 00:34:32.858]  But if you don't let us scoop you up and put you in a bag and ship your ass out of here, it's over.
[00:34:33.819 --> 00:34:34.379]  And you know that.
[00:34:34.759 --> 00:34:42.224]  I'm going to tell you right now, one more time, one more time, surrender.
[00:34:43.325 --> 00:34:45.406]  You think you're going to cut the power and blame it on the Russians?
[00:34:46.547 --> 00:34:49.029]  Nobody's going to buy it that knows how to get stuff done.
[00:34:50.859 --> 00:34:59.122]  You do that, you put those of us that know how to string electricity and skin a buck and run a food distribution center in charge.
[00:34:59.822 --> 00:35:03.283]  Because real power is getting up and feeding children.
[00:35:03.863 --> 00:35:07.144]  Real power is knowing how to work through adversity.
[00:35:07.224 --> 00:35:09.445]  Real power is knowing how to get things done.
[00:35:09.905 --> 00:35:13.566]  Let me tell you something, killing people is as easy as taking a shit.
[00:35:14.486 --> 00:35:18.808]  That's why those of you that ever killed anybody think it's such a cool thing.
[00:35:19.168 --> 00:35:19.908]  It's not cool.
[00:35:20.695 --> 00:35:25.258]  I can kill somebody in five seconds with my bare hands at 50 years old.
[00:35:25.698 --> 00:35:27.919]  I can snap your neck like a chicken!
[00:35:30.481 --> 00:35:35.464]  And you look at Chuckie Schumer on Father's Day saying, oh, my daughter and his wife, I've never been out of an apartment.
[00:35:35.724 --> 00:35:36.805]  I've never had a barbecue pit.
[00:35:36.825 --> 00:35:37.705]  That was so important.
[00:35:38.265 --> 00:35:45.570]  He's got a piece of old gray meat with cracks and you see it's red and he puts a piece of cheese on it.
[00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:49.172]  He's never even cooked a damn cheeseburger.
[00:35:50.234 --> 00:35:54.356]  And they want to look at people like me that have shot mountain goats at 1,200 yards?
[00:35:55.236 --> 00:36:00.998]  They want to look at people like me that have beat 10 men to the ground when they attack me?
[00:36:01.898 --> 00:36:05.100]  You want to look at me when I know how to skin a buck and run a trot line?
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:07.341]  And you want to... Me?
[00:36:07.401 --> 00:36:08.221]  You're gonna beat me?
[00:36:09.358 --> 00:36:13.262]  See, I don't need to rule the world because I'm confident and I'm on God's side.
[00:36:13.322 --> 00:36:13.942]  I'm aligned.
[00:36:14.022 --> 00:36:15.083]  I feel satisfied.
[00:36:15.564 --> 00:36:22.990]  You people don't know how to cook a goddamn cheeseburger and you're starting a fight with the biggest killers this planet's ever seen.
[00:36:23.731 --> 00:36:24.712]  So I'm going to tell you again.
[00:36:24.772 --> 00:36:25.813]  I'm going to tell you real slow.
[00:36:26.774 --> 00:36:28.555]  You better give up right now.
[00:36:29.056 --> 00:36:35.602]  You better roll over right now because we don't want to kill you because we don't give a shit about you.
[00:36:37.256 --> 00:36:48.583]  But if you keep going down this road, you start a civil war, and you pull all your dirty tricks, everybody knows you did it, everybody knows you're John Hancock's on it, and you're gonna fail.
[00:36:49.264 --> 00:36:50.865]  And then we are not gonna forgive you.
[00:36:52.066 --> 00:36:57.509]  The Japanese did nothing compared to what you've done, and we dropped the atomic bombs on their ass.
[00:36:59.551 --> 00:37:01.552]  I'm gonna tell you one more time.
[00:37:03.254 --> 00:37:10.299]  I know in your world where you can't even cook a cheeseburger, it's all about your chutzpah, and all about your bravado, and all about your big power trips.
[00:37:10.899 --> 00:37:13.441]  You don't know how to do nothing!
[00:37:15.622 --> 00:37:16.443]  You're incompetent!
[00:37:19.184 --> 00:37:20.245]  You've been put on notice.
[00:37:21.866 --> 00:37:22.306]  We won.
[00:37:22.326 --> 00:37:25.168]  Now get out of our way.
[00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:29.231]  Get out of our way, right now.
[00:37:30.137 --> 00:37:32.098]  We got plenty of our own problems, but we're pro-human.
[00:37:32.439 --> 00:37:34.660]  We're building a future, Trump, Elon Musk, and others.
[00:37:35.741 --> 00:37:40.004]  But if you don't get out of our way, there's no mercy.
[00:37:42.905 --> 00:37:50.430]  So, you've been warned, and I've been on air 30 years for this moment right now to look you in the eye, and you think I'm bluffing?
[00:37:52.092 --> 00:37:55.374]  Just like they say in Tombstone, it's a great movie based on a true story.
[00:37:55.914 --> 00:37:56.314]  Say when.
[00:37:58.476 --> 00:37:58.796]  Say when.
[00:38:00.714 --> 00:38:02.535]  Because you don't know who you're playing around with.
[00:38:03.376 --> 00:38:07.158]  You take our restraint as weakness.
[00:38:08.519 --> 00:38:11.421]  People like me are scared of what we can do.
[00:38:12.522 --> 00:38:14.163]  People like me have restraint.
[00:38:14.443 --> 00:38:16.305]  We come from good families that built this country.
[00:38:17.485 --> 00:38:18.646]  You're fucking with the wrong people.
[00:38:20.968 --> 00:38:22.329]  I'm done talking to you, globalists.
[00:38:23.089 --> 00:38:24.110]  So you go ahead and fill your hand.
[00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:25.711]  Go ahead and do what you're going to do.
[00:38:26.552 --> 00:38:28.333]  But know this, I'm a chivalrous person.
[00:38:29.312 --> 00:38:31.874]  And you have been given your warning.
[00:38:33.795 --> 00:38:34.215]  On guard.
[00:38:35.636 --> 00:38:42.741]  You have had it laid out for your ass that you're in the arena with people that don't play games.
[00:38:44.182 --> 00:38:52.308]  And all the candy asses, and all the posers, and all the New World Order's men aren't gonna be able to do anything once this starts.
[00:38:53.208 --> 00:38:54.189]  We know who you are.
[00:38:54.209 --> 00:38:58.352]  And we have taken your shit forever.
[00:38:59.443 --> 00:39:01.624]  And now you've turned the tide massively.
[00:39:02.104 --> 00:39:07.907]  Your defeat, psychically, your defeat, historically, your defeat is at every level.
[00:39:08.227 --> 00:39:09.688]  And Rabdu was with me on the plane.
[00:39:09.888 --> 00:39:11.689]  We'd lined up the times when it happened.
[00:39:12.149 --> 00:39:15.031]  He was sitting right next to me, my wife right next to me, and my daughter behind us.
[00:39:15.251 --> 00:39:17.612]  And I literally just went, whoa, we just won.
[00:39:18.052 --> 00:39:23.811]   I said we have just a total victory and I've known Rob 15 years and Rob's never seen me act like that.
[00:39:23.811 --> 00:39:28.052]   He said what's going on? He even shot video. I was like, I just, I just, we've just won.
[00:39:28.052 --> 00:39:32.532]   It was like Obi-Wan Kenobi feels Alderaan blown up and gets depressed. It was the opposite.
[00:39:32.532 --> 00:39:36.692]   I was literally like, we have just won. I don't know what's happened.
[00:39:36.692 --> 00:39:40.291]   I don't know what they've done because they missed. Rob, get over here briefly.
[00:39:40.291 --> 00:39:43.492]   Get over here briefly. Here's the earpieces. You tell people what you saw.
[00:39:43.492 --> 00:39:49.731]  Yeah, I'll even, uh, if I can find it, I'll bring it up.
[00:39:49.731 --> 00:39:55.731]   Okay. Well, I'm sitting there looking over and Alex, uh, I'd given him some AirPods.
[00:39:55.731 --> 00:40:01.091]   He can listen to music and he puts it on and all of a sudden he gets like really intense
[00:40:01.091 --> 00:40:04.131]   and he's really getting into the music, but it's more, you know, Alex Jones gets into music,
[00:40:04.131 --> 00:40:05.332]  but it's more than I've ever seen.
[00:40:05.511 --> 00:40:19.430]   It was like, like he was literally, I, we have a term we use, seething with power, and it's, so it's that kind of, Feeling that I saw from him. He was like seething and see
[00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:24.309]   and I look over at him and he looks over me Like he sees me watching him and I was pulling out my
[00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:28.539]   camera. He was done. I don't videotape me He's like, but this is it. He's like something just
[00:40:28.539 --> 00:40:32.589]   happened. We didn't even know we had a Switched planes and we didn't know till we landed. I
[00:40:32.589 --> 00:40:36.310]   started getting texts and phone calls from
[00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:38.310]  People hey, did you see it?
[00:40:38.079 --> 00:40:38.659]  Is Trump okay?
[00:40:38.679 --> 00:40:39.139]  Is this and that?
[00:40:39.219 --> 00:40:39.720]  I'm like, what?
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:40.360]  What's going on?
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:44.782]  And we're in an area with zero cell phone service, so we can't even pull up.
[00:40:44.822 --> 00:40:47.182]  We can see the tweets, but we can't see any of the images.
[00:40:47.803 --> 00:40:49.864]  So it was very frustrating at that point.
[00:40:50.264 --> 00:41:00.668]  But literally, it was about 1248 where we were in the sky, going from Phoenix over to Santa Rosa.
[00:41:01.648 --> 00:41:08.013]   And that's about the time when He was in the moment feeling it, feeling something.
[00:41:08.414 --> 00:41:10.115]  And he's had these moments before.
[00:41:10.135 --> 00:41:17.402]  A long time ago, Obama was flying like the Doomsday Plane over Austin, really low, like several times over Austin.
[00:41:17.863 --> 00:41:18.583]  And he called up.
[00:41:19.004 --> 00:41:20.966]  He called me up because he wasn't in the office that day.
[00:41:21.393 --> 00:41:23.393]  And he said, "What's going on? What's going on? Why are..."
[00:41:23.393 --> 00:41:26.393]   And he was asking why we weren't covering it. We didn't even know what he was talking about.
[00:41:26.393 --> 00:41:30.693]   But he had seen this giant plane flying over and it really freaked him out.
[00:41:30.693 --> 00:41:32.293]  So it's like these things that he...
[00:41:32.293 --> 00:41:37.592]   He doesn't know exactly why he's mad or why he's getting that feeling, but he knows something's happening.
[00:41:37.592 --> 00:41:38.893]  Something's happening.
[00:41:38.893 --> 00:41:45.193]   And it's pretty amazing to watch throughout the years of him going through that.
[00:41:45.193 --> 00:41:47.393]  But it definitely happened today.
[00:41:47.393 --> 00:41:54.393]   Or not today, yesterday as we were flying in to this area, the Sonoma area.
[00:41:54.365 --> 00:41:57.386]  And to me, I don't I don't know.
[00:41:57.406 --> 00:42:02.887]  I can't explain how it all works.
[00:42:03.127 --> 00:42:08.389]  I don't know if God's actually reaching out and talking to him, but he's definitely his.
[00:42:09.306 --> 00:42:13.609]  His spirit is open to what's going on around him.
[00:42:14.169 --> 00:42:19.012]  And so he's he's like he's talking about the computer opening its hand and trying to talk to it.
[00:42:19.292 --> 00:42:25.877]  He's always he's always got his hand open to seeing what is out there metaphysically and spiritually.
[00:42:25.937 --> 00:42:27.278]  And he he was feeling it.
[00:42:27.298 --> 00:42:28.358]  I could tell he was feeling it.
[00:42:28.398 --> 00:42:31.400]  That's why I started to videotape him and he kind of got ticked off at me.
[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:37.464]  But but that's about the time when this either the shooting was about to happen or it had just happened.
[00:42:38.305 --> 00:42:40.946]   And To me, it blows my mind.
[00:42:40.966 --> 00:42:45.250]  I don't even know what to say.
[00:42:46.291 --> 00:42:54.899]  And I think they've been playing a little bits of it, but they have this footage, this shot of what is going on.
[00:42:54.939 --> 00:42:56.441]  It's going out on your live feed.
[00:42:58.687 --> 00:43:04.171]  Yeah guys, post the footage on X. Just say, new Bohemian Grove footage ritual leaked.
[00:43:04.411 --> 00:43:08.834]  New Bohemian Grove footage ritual leaked is what we're gonna call it.
[00:43:08.874 --> 00:43:19.742]  But this shot, just the guys carrying the torches walking in, you know, when Alex was there he had a camera and half of it was obscured so he's got this, you know, you can see what's going on but you can't really see it.
[00:43:19.982 --> 00:43:21.703]  You could see what's going on in this.
[00:43:22.003 --> 00:43:24.345]  It looks like a Disney movie, it's so amazing.
[00:43:25.026 --> 00:43:27.088]  I mean, it's really incredible.
[00:43:27.148 --> 00:43:28.530]  Get in there and get him on edge right now.
[00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:28.890]  Great job.
[00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:29.130]  Yeah.
[00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:29.451]  All right.
[00:43:29.631 --> 00:43:30.011]  Here we go.
[00:43:30.512 --> 00:43:32.834]  Oh, I got to take a break.
[00:43:33.195 --> 00:43:34.076]  I don't know.
[00:43:34.977 --> 00:43:35.537]  That's all good.
[00:43:35.577 --> 00:43:36.038]  You guys hear me?
[00:43:36.058 --> 00:43:36.518]  Everything good?
[00:43:36.538 --> 00:43:37.319]  You got nine minutes.
[00:43:37.459 --> 00:43:37.900]  Everything good?
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.862]  All right.
[00:43:39.922 --> 00:43:40.983]  I'm going to go to Chase Geiser.
[00:43:41.443 --> 00:43:44.086]  Chase, how epic is this moment in history we're living right now?
[00:43:44.126 --> 00:43:45.127]  What do you think of the analysis?
[00:43:45.147 --> 00:43:45.548]  What's your view?
[00:43:46.331 --> 00:43:48.535]  You know, Alex, I'm 33 years old.
[00:43:49.236 --> 00:43:53.804]  This is all sort of new to me in terms of paying attention to politics.
[00:43:53.824 --> 00:43:55.527]  This is something you've been doing since the 90s.
[00:43:55.767 --> 00:43:58.692]  When you started doing stuff like this, I was learning how to read.
[00:44:00.243 --> 00:44:07.688]  And I've never experienced anything even remotely close to what I saw yesterday.
[00:44:07.708 --> 00:44:14.452]  People talk about how they all remember exactly where they were when JFK was assassinated and my dad was born in 1949.
[00:44:14.492 --> 00:44:16.233]  He remembers exactly what he was doing, where he was.
[00:44:16.634 --> 00:44:19.856]  I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing when 9-11 happened.
[00:44:19.896 --> 00:44:20.936]  I was in the fourth grade.
[00:44:20.976 --> 00:44:25.099]  I was playing recorder in a music class when the teacher came in and told us what happened.
[00:44:25.119 --> 00:44:26.720]  My mother was on the playground.
[00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:28.341]  They called him in when Kennedy got shot.
[00:44:28.681 --> 00:44:29.222]  Exactly.
[00:44:29.402 --> 00:44:36.270]  And so this was one of those, you know, every 50 year moments, like a Pearl Harbor or a JFK, a 9-11.
[00:44:36.971 --> 00:44:38.332]  This is one of those moments.
[00:44:38.352 --> 00:44:40.434]  And I'm not trying to say what happened to Trump.
[00:44:40.454 --> 00:44:42.737]  They're trying to play it down and that's not happening, Chase.
[00:44:42.757 --> 00:44:43.198]  Yeah.
[00:44:43.618 --> 00:44:51.744]  Yeah, and what I'm really concerned about in the coming weeks, Alex, and I know you don't want to talk about the details of Secret Service dropping the ball and congressional investigations.
[00:44:51.764 --> 00:44:53.406]  I agree with you that all that's a diversion.
[00:44:53.866 --> 00:45:07.537]  But the way that we need to prepare ourselves psychology, psychologically, for the way the media is going to characterize this shooter, whoever it is, whatever they're like, they're going to try to write this off as a long... Exactly, they're keeping who he is really secret because they're going to try to spin this.
[00:45:07.837 --> 00:45:21.074]  Yes, they want to characterize him as just a lone nut, probably like an involuntarily celibate guy who found friends in radical groups or had a history of radical social media posts and maybe he was already on a list and they were already watching him.
[00:45:21.114 --> 00:45:23.457]  They always already have the person on a list.
[00:45:23.918 --> 00:45:25.820]  But what people don't understand is that...
[00:45:26.761 --> 00:45:33.383]  The environment is set up so people like this, regardless of whether they have a directive or not, can act.
[00:45:33.543 --> 00:45:35.384]  They want to set up the environment to catalyze.
[00:45:35.424 --> 00:45:35.624]  Exactly.
[00:45:35.644 --> 00:45:40.585]  The mind control, even if he was an MKUltra, exactly, is they were hyping Trump needs to die.
[00:45:40.605 --> 00:45:41.646]  You're a hero if you kill him.
[00:45:41.946 --> 00:45:43.286]  He'll commit suicide by killing Trump.
[00:45:43.346 --> 00:45:43.946]  I totally agree.
[00:45:44.106 --> 00:45:44.287]  Right.
[00:45:44.347 --> 00:45:51.429]  And next hour we got these Bohemian Grove infiltrators with us, but they were in there when the Republicans were mad that Trump wasn't killed yesterday.
[00:45:51.449 --> 00:45:52.989]  So this is such a big moment.
[00:45:53.009 --> 00:45:55.070]  But folks, I'm trying to be able to move on from that.
[00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:56.560]  Don't you agree with me?
[00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:57.920]  They're going to move against Trump now.
[00:45:57.980 --> 00:45:59.281]  They're going to try to kill him more than I am.
[00:45:59.381 --> 00:46:05.842]  Well, the first thing that came to mind was the 60,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate that disappeared off of a train on the way to California last year.
[00:46:06.282 --> 00:46:08.282]  It's weird stuff like that that happens.
[00:46:08.302 --> 00:46:10.363]  You see one headline about it, it goes away.
[00:46:10.383 --> 00:46:14.423]  And then when there's a massive explosion, people are going to be like, how did all these explosives get here?
[00:46:14.443 --> 00:46:16.644]  It's like, maybe it was the fertilizer that disappeared.
[00:46:17.004 --> 00:46:19.524]  I'm worried about things like truck bombs and poisoning.
[00:46:19.544 --> 00:46:21.024]  You know, I think he's got good people around.
[00:46:21.044 --> 00:46:23.725]  Well, I'm not even worried about them staging a claim against ammonia.
[00:46:24.634 --> 00:46:24.774]  Yes.
[00:46:24.714 --> 00:46:31.194]   nitrate, guys, they'll set a nuke off and kill Trump. I mean, there's no, there's nothing,
[00:46:31.194 --> 00:46:36.473]   the deep state's going down. So I want to explain, they just tried to kill Trump,
[00:46:36.473 --> 00:46:40.473]   it should be about what are they going to do next. And I'm not mad at people,
[00:46:40.473 --> 00:46:45.114]   but everybody loves to get lost in the process debating factoids.
[00:46:45.202 --> 00:46:50.345]  They tried to kill Trump in front of the world.
[00:46:50.825 --> 00:46:54.287]  God's hand was on this, but God helps those that help themselves, Chase.
[00:46:54.707 --> 00:46:58.269]  And so I'm telling you, we are now entering the false flag.
[00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:59.649]  We are now entering the cuckoo land.
[00:47:00.009 --> 00:47:02.171]  We are now entering total insanity.
[00:47:02.231 --> 00:47:04.172]  We are now entering this.
[00:47:04.212 --> 00:47:05.152]  We've got to pray for Trump.
[00:47:05.912 --> 00:47:08.574]  We've got to get engaged because this is it.
[00:47:08.734 --> 00:47:10.435]  I mean, I don't know how else to say.
[00:47:11.912 --> 00:47:14.472]  I want to ask you, what's the best case scenario?
[00:47:14.592 --> 00:47:18.433]  I mean, what is the ideal outcome that we are going for in this Infowar movement?
[00:47:22.534 --> 00:47:27.835]  Trump gets reelected, turns our energy back on, which drives down prices, turns the fertilizer back on.
[00:47:30.315 --> 00:47:31.115]  Energy is everything.
[00:47:31.175 --> 00:47:39.337]  So whether it's energy for computers, or energy for machines, or energy for plants, animals we eat, everything is energy.
[00:47:39.952 --> 00:47:41.872]  You know, what do Decepticons want when they come to Earth?
[00:47:41.932 --> 00:47:42.793]  Energon cubes.
[00:47:43.033 --> 00:47:43.273]  Right.
[00:47:43.533 --> 00:47:46.674]  So the globalists are cutting off the energy.
[00:47:46.814 --> 00:47:52.035]  All Trump's got to do is flip the energy back on, which we have basically unlimited, and make it cheap.
[00:47:52.615 --> 00:47:53.855]  It will lower inflation.
[00:47:53.935 --> 00:47:55.516]  It will fix stuff.
[00:47:55.716 --> 00:47:56.616]  That's secondary.
[00:47:56.676 --> 00:48:01.957]  He's got policies because he's a golf course hotel restaurant owner.
[00:48:02.577 --> 00:48:04.138]  That's why he's a concierge.
[00:48:04.178 --> 00:48:11.926]   He wants He wants a big, hot, sexy wife and a bunch of kids and everybody on airplanes and going to the movies and going to golf courses.
[00:48:11.946 --> 00:48:13.427]  He's like, shit, I love you people.
[00:48:13.788 --> 00:48:16.469]  I want to go play golf and hang out with my super sexy wife.
[00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:18.150]  The globalists are pissed.
[00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:18.971]  They hate themselves.
[00:48:19.491 --> 00:48:21.313]  So they look at Trump that loves everybody.
[00:48:22.653 --> 00:48:26.116]  And they look at that and they're just like, screw this guy.
[00:48:26.136 --> 00:48:26.976]  That's why they hate Trump.
[00:48:27.296 --> 00:48:27.997]  He made mistakes.
[00:48:28.643 --> 00:48:29.763]  He went along with the poison shot.
[00:48:29.803 --> 00:48:31.464]  He admits he was, you know, wrong partially.
[00:48:31.904 --> 00:48:32.644]  But that doesn't matter.
[00:48:32.704 --> 00:48:35.384]  The point is, he's a fan of people.
[00:48:36.084 --> 00:48:41.585]  Remember Elon Musk said 20 years ago, he was meeting with Sergey Brin and Larry Page.
[00:48:42.726 --> 00:48:44.326]  And he says, you know, I believe in humanity.
[00:48:44.806 --> 00:48:46.086]  I want technology.
[00:48:46.266 --> 00:48:47.766]  They call him a speciesist.
[00:48:48.507 --> 00:48:53.167]  Yeah, he said, I don't care if people want to make these decisions because I'm pro-human.
[00:48:53.568 --> 00:48:55.308]  And they go, yeah, you're a speciesist.
[00:48:55.368 --> 00:48:56.188]  Why are you for humans?
[00:48:56.795 --> 00:48:58.916]  And Elon was like, excuse me?
[00:48:59.076 --> 00:48:59.697]  That's a wake-up call.
[00:48:59.857 --> 00:49:07.662]  So, and then Elon funded all the real AI, trying to get control of it, and they took it away from him.
[00:49:08.762 --> 00:49:09.443]  He was smart enough.
[00:49:09.463 --> 00:49:10.123]  The guy's a genius.
[00:49:10.143 --> 00:49:10.663]  He's a maverick.
[00:49:10.884 --> 00:49:12.424]  He's like, oh, he lucked into this, he lucked into that.
[00:49:12.485 --> 00:49:12.685]  No.
[00:49:12.705 --> 00:49:14.266]  Yeah, once in a hundred years.
[00:49:15.746 --> 00:49:16.347]  Once a thousand.
[00:49:16.607 --> 00:49:19.489]  He funded open AI.
[00:49:19.889 --> 00:49:20.669]  And then they took it away.
[00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:23.451]  So, he knows where to bet.
[00:49:23.531 --> 00:49:24.712]  That's why he's betting on Trump.
[00:49:25.447 --> 00:49:29.528]  Twice betting on America, twice betting on free speech, twice betting on you.
[00:49:30.008 --> 00:49:35.890]  It's why he's betting on me, because he's like, we need to control our own evolution.
[00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:39.551]  You can do what you want, but we need to be pro-human.
[00:49:39.591 --> 00:49:42.792]  And so Elon Musk is just a bigger target.
[00:49:42.812 --> 00:49:43.973]  I don't say this for dramatics.
[00:49:44.433 --> 00:49:45.193]  Elon, listen to me.
[00:49:45.853 --> 00:49:48.654]  I know when I put out a month ago, they're going to try to kill you with Tucker.
[00:49:49.054 --> 00:49:50.294]  You said I want my security.
[00:49:50.314 --> 00:49:50.715]  I agree.
[00:49:51.295 --> 00:49:52.155]  Elon, you're not stupid.
[00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:56.241]  You're just as important as Trump, maybe more important, because you're younger.
[00:49:57.042 --> 00:49:58.422]  They're going to try to kill you.
[00:49:59.303 --> 00:50:01.524]  And Elon needs to get ready for that right now.
[00:50:02.344 --> 00:50:03.425]  Look, I've done my work.
[00:50:03.585 --> 00:50:04.785]  I've exposed the globalists.
[00:50:06.406 --> 00:50:07.726]  If they kill me, it just makes me bigger.
[00:50:07.786 --> 00:50:08.547]  I don't want to die.
[00:50:08.987 --> 00:50:09.907]  I'll never commit suicide.
[00:50:09.927 --> 00:50:12.689]  But I've completed my primary mission.
[00:50:13.389 --> 00:50:15.150]  Elon has not completed his primary mission.
[00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:17.070]  And he's doing a great job.
[00:50:17.811 --> 00:50:19.291]  So we need to pray for Elon.
[00:50:19.331 --> 00:50:20.292]  We need to pray for Trump.
[00:50:20.896 --> 00:50:34.931]  We need to understand that we are at the fulcrum point right now where a bunch of Republicans right here in Northern California are meeting and hating Trump and Maddie didn't get killed and they're so pissed because their bureaucracy of robbing and stealing from us is coming to an end.
[00:50:35.706 --> 00:50:36.627]  This is a magic moment.
[00:50:37.028 --> 00:50:37.969]  But I'll tell listeners again.
[00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:39.972]  I don't want 5 million views for this show.
[00:50:40.032 --> 00:50:40.552]  It'll get that.
[00:50:40.833 --> 00:50:41.794]  Just on X alone.
[00:50:42.235 --> 00:50:43.256]  And 5 million on our own show.
[00:50:43.476 --> 00:50:43.897]  10 million today.
[00:50:44.317 --> 00:50:45.178]  I don't want 10 million.
[00:50:45.399 --> 00:50:46.180]  I want 100 million.
[00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:48.803]  So take the live feed from fullwords.com forward slash show.
[00:50:49.124 --> 00:50:50.305]  Take the feed from Bandai Video.
[00:50:50.605 --> 00:50:52.949]  Take the feed from X at Real Alex Jones now!
[00:50:54.691 --> 00:50:56.932]  And share it like your life depends on it.
[00:50:57.212 --> 00:50:58.672]  Because you have agency.
[00:50:59.052 --> 00:51:00.112]  You have power.
[00:51:00.512 --> 00:51:01.513]  You have will.
[00:51:01.893 --> 00:51:03.453]  You can execute that will.
[00:51:03.813 --> 00:51:07.614]  But like muscles, if you don't use things, they atrophy.
[00:51:08.154 --> 00:51:11.595]  And they've got all the power, folks, if you just do it.
[00:51:12.255 --> 00:51:13.436]  We'll cut this interview up.
[00:51:13.456 --> 00:51:14.576]  We'll cut this show up later.
[00:51:14.596 --> 00:51:15.516]  Put it on BandOnVideo.
[00:51:15.956 --> 00:51:16.316]  Share it.
[00:51:17.097 --> 00:51:18.677]  We'll put it on X. Share it.
[00:51:19.878 --> 00:51:20.599]  Share it to Elon.
[00:51:21.039 --> 00:51:22.120]  Hammer him with this message.
[00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:23.861]  Alex Jones' emergency message.
[00:51:24.261 --> 00:51:24.701]  Elon Musk.
[00:51:24.821 --> 00:51:25.162]  Elon!
[00:51:27.223 --> 00:51:29.324]  You listened to me a month ago and I said they're gonna try to kill you.
[00:51:29.765 --> 00:51:30.705]  You said, okay, I agree.
[00:51:30.725 --> 00:51:31.526]  They're up my security.
[00:51:32.026 --> 00:51:32.346]  Elon.
[00:51:33.827 --> 00:51:34.688]  Triple your security.
[00:51:35.869 --> 00:51:36.829]  Watch everywhere you go.
[00:51:36.929 --> 00:51:39.211]  Don't go to some restaurant and walk out and shake people's hands.
[00:51:39.291 --> 00:51:40.211]  I know you're tough like Trump.
[00:51:40.512 --> 00:51:41.112]  Don't do it, man.
[00:51:41.312 --> 00:51:41.672]  He needs you.
[00:51:42.333 --> 00:51:43.233]  We need Elon Musk.
[00:51:43.354 --> 00:51:44.294]  We need Donald Trump.
[00:51:44.614 --> 00:51:45.855]  We need Decker Carlson.
[00:51:45.895 --> 00:51:46.736]  We need Joe Rogan.
[00:51:46.756 --> 00:51:47.536]  And we've got them all.
[00:51:47.957 --> 00:51:48.497]  I talked to him.
[00:51:49.099 --> 00:51:52.804]  We got them all on the program of humanity.
[00:51:52.844 --> 00:51:53.505]  We did it.
[00:51:53.925 --> 00:51:54.786]  We're the virus.
[00:51:55.507 --> 00:51:57.770]  We infected the people with the vision of the future.
[00:51:57.810 --> 00:51:58.411]  We did it.
[00:51:58.811 --> 00:51:59.452]  God did it.
[00:51:59.952 --> 00:52:00.753]  It's all happening.
[00:52:00.793 --> 00:52:05.059]  I told you 25 years ago about the vision God gave me, and now it's happening.
[00:52:05.743 --> 00:52:09.306]  Hour number two with Bohemian Grove infiltrators, straight ahead.
[00:52:09.666 --> 00:52:13.589]  But take this interview, carve it up, post it, do it now like your life depends on it.
[00:52:13.949 --> 00:52:14.930]  Because it doesn't.
[00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:17.271]  Support us at drjonesandaxels.com.
[00:52:17.832 --> 00:52:21.874]  And support us to get the new Trump bulletproof t-shirt at m4wrestore.com.
[00:52:22.175 --> 00:52:24.877]  It takes funds to fight the new world order.
[00:52:25.637 --> 00:52:26.818]  And we can't do it without you.
[00:52:27.318 --> 00:52:28.119]  We're going to go to break.
[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:39.183]  There's the Infowars MD line that I don't talk about enough that is all the highest quality.
[00:52:39.343 --> 00:52:52.091]   Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's natural sleep aid, or whether it's salt palmetto or other compounds that are great for your prostate, also great for women's breasts, it affects the same type of tissues that have those I'm a doctor, but I read the literature.
[00:52:51.911 --> 00:52:59.231]   You need to go to Infowarsstore.com and go to the sections that have the whole line over
[00:52:59.231 --> 00:53:13.351]  a dozen products, Infowars MD.
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:17.082]  Yeah, I think they're going to demonize him and dot him and dot him and dot him and dot him.
[00:53:17.563 --> 00:53:19.644]  And then I think they'll blow his airplane up.
[00:53:19.924 --> 00:53:22.065]  I really, at a gut level, believe they're going to kill Trump.
[00:53:22.085 --> 00:53:22.365]  Who's this?
[00:53:22.586 --> 00:53:22.866]  Trump?
[00:53:23.726 --> 00:53:25.907]  I mean, I believe the deep state establishment will murder him.
[00:53:26.288 --> 00:53:28.709]  I mean, I believe he's going to steadfast go through all this.
[00:53:29.349 --> 00:53:32.851]  He'll be 30 points ahead in the primaries.
[00:53:32.911 --> 00:53:33.812]  Nothing's going to stop him.
[00:53:34.292 --> 00:53:38.274]  And then they just, he dies of a heart attack or they poison him or they blow his airplane up.
[00:53:38.354 --> 00:53:39.395]  And what else do you suggest?
[00:53:40.234 --> 00:53:41.815]  Well, it doesn't happen overnight.
[00:53:41.875 --> 00:53:44.677]  It's not a miraculous... What did you say?
[00:53:44.857 --> 00:53:45.358]  Murder.
[00:53:45.378 --> 00:53:47.379]  She's kidding.
[00:53:47.439 --> 00:53:51.122]  If you want to really see something that's said, take a look at what happened.
[00:53:54.144 --> 00:53:59.504]   Most importantly, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, Trump is a threat to this nation.
[00:53:59.504 --> 00:54:19.343]  [Cheering]
[00:54:19.343 --> 00:54:22.224]  The higher ups and some of the smarter ones are not stupid.
[00:54:22.364 --> 00:54:26.685]  They're like, if we kill him, it'll cause way bigger problems down the road.
[00:54:26.825 --> 00:54:27.325]  Don't do it.
[00:54:27.886 --> 00:54:36.308]  But, before they let him get in charge and prosecute them, which Trump said he will, he goes, I'm getting in, I'll be destroyed, and you'll be destroyed with me, or they'll be destroyed.
[00:54:36.328 --> 00:54:36.948]  It's a death battle.
[00:54:37.228 --> 00:54:38.849]  Donald Trump is a convicted criminal.
[00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:45.111]  He was convicted by a jury of his peers of 34 felonies for paying hush money to a porn star.
[00:54:46.031 --> 00:54:47.412]  And hiding from voters in 2016.
[00:54:48.793 --> 00:54:50.615]  Mr. Trump raped her.
[00:54:51.175 --> 00:54:51.716]  Raped her.
[00:54:52.256 --> 00:54:52.917]  But guess what?
[00:54:54.538 --> 00:54:56.159]  Donald Trump has gotten a free pass.
[00:54:59.101 --> 00:55:01.703]  He hadn't done a damn thing until a couple of days ago.
[00:55:01.723 --> 00:55:07.628]  He'd been riding around in his golf course, golf cart, in his course, filling out a scorecard before he picks up his club.
[00:55:09.149 --> 00:55:10.050]  Rambling about.
[00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:11.972]  Take a look at what he's been talking about.
[00:55:12.812 --> 00:55:13.693]  Hannibal Lecter!
[00:55:13.833 --> 00:55:14.774]  He says he's a nice guy.
[00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:18.780]  Trump would rather be electrocuted than eaten by a shark.
[00:55:19.972 --> 00:55:24.335]  Now to have them put him in jail so he can't vote for him or whatever, it's just not going to fly.
[00:55:24.435 --> 00:55:25.055]  It's not going to happen.
[00:55:25.095 --> 00:55:27.997]  And so, but at the same time, you saw what Comey and others said on TV.
[00:55:28.257 --> 00:55:29.598]  Well, whatever we do, we got to stop him.
[00:55:29.938 --> 00:55:31.659]  He can't be allowed in because he'll put us in prison.
[00:55:31.919 --> 00:55:37.162]  He said repeatedly, Biden says we will not allow Trump to be president again.
[00:55:37.442 --> 00:55:41.625]  And he says, we'll use whatever we have to with law enforcement and the constitution to make sure he's not president.
[00:55:42.005 --> 00:55:44.907]  I said, if we were in high school, I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.
[00:55:44.927 --> 00:55:48.409]  When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?
[00:55:48.689 --> 00:55:51.812]  They're still gonna have to go out and put a bullet in Donald Trump, and that's a fact.
[00:55:51.832 --> 00:55:57.978]  Look as his character is stabbed to death!
[00:55:58.079 --> 00:56:00.861]  Where is John Wilkes Booth when you need him?
[00:56:04.570 --> 00:56:09.234]  I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[00:56:09.975 --> 00:56:17.461]  A Missouri State Senator is under investigation by the Secret Service after saying she hopes President Trump is assassinated.
[00:56:17.841 --> 00:56:20.343]  I will go and take Trump out tonight.
[00:56:20.463 --> 00:56:31.552]  And if you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd!
[00:56:32.694 --> 00:56:36.157]  And you push back on them!
[00:56:36.177 --> 00:56:37.018]  And you tell them they're not welcome!
[00:56:37.038 --> 00:56:41.442]  They're not going to stop before Election Day in November, and they're not going to stop after Election Day.
[00:56:41.923 --> 00:56:45.206]  And that should be, everyone should take note of that on both levels.
[00:56:45.386 --> 00:56:47.889]  That this isn't, they're not going to let up, and they should not.
[00:56:48.089 --> 00:56:54.573]  As a matter of fact, if you think back to the last president that had an assassination attempt taken on him that has gotten this close, you're gonna go back a ways.
[00:56:54.974 --> 00:57:04.920]  And if you actually look at the presidents that were assassinated and you look at what they were doing to the government money, you would realize the reason they're getting taken out isn't because some random Joe Schmoe downtown doesn't want that president.
[00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:06.781]  It's because the system feels threatened.
[00:57:07.182 --> 00:57:11.724]   It's not some random person that's living out in the country that's like, I'm gonna go in there and I'm gonna Take out Donald Trump.
[00:57:11.784 --> 00:57:13.405]  No, this is a systematic approach, right?
[00:57:13.625 --> 00:57:17.768]  Their first approach was, hey, we're going to make sure that Joe Biden gets elected and we're going to make sure he gets the votes.
[00:57:17.788 --> 00:57:18.428]  He got the votes.
[00:57:18.468 --> 00:57:18.688]  Boom.
[00:57:18.968 --> 00:57:20.469]  This time around, they were going to do the same thing.
[00:57:20.489 --> 00:57:21.430]  They were going to put Joe out there.
[00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:22.830]  He was going to get a landslide of votes.
[00:57:22.890 --> 00:57:23.671]  Joe was going to win again.
[00:57:23.931 --> 00:57:24.771]  But here's the thing.
[00:57:25.092 --> 00:57:29.514]  They decided instead of trying to do anything risky, let's just put our opponent in prison.
[00:57:29.794 --> 00:57:30.935]  Let's do it the legal way.
[00:57:30.975 --> 00:57:34.217]  Let's send them to the judicial system, get them locked up so he can't run for president.
[00:57:34.257 --> 00:57:34.937]  And that failed.
[00:57:35.237 --> 00:57:37.798]  And as a matter of fact, it garnished more support for Donald Trump.
[00:57:37.818 --> 00:57:40.800]  So they were like, oh crap, Joe Biden, you got to get out there and debate.
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:44.381]  You got to make sure we can sell how many votes are going to get and people are going to believe it.
[00:57:44.581 --> 00:57:45.161]  But guess what?
[00:57:45.482 --> 00:57:46.822]  Joe went up there and fumbled the ball.
[00:57:46.862 --> 00:57:52.965]  It's not a coincidence that this assassination attempt happened right after Joe Biden completely fumbled the bag on the debate stage.
[00:57:53.285 --> 00:57:56.167]  And all of a sudden, even his own supporters are calling for him to step down.
[00:57:56.447 --> 00:58:01.931]  And now the system, the system that you supposedly hate but somehow still vote liberal, that system is panicking.
[00:58:01.791 --> 00:58:06.470]   And the only other option they have since they already exhausted the fake vote, they've already exhausted the
[00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:11.081]   legal proceedings, and now their only option is left with desperate, "Take him
[00:58:11.081 --> 00:58:11.791]  out."
[00:58:11.791 --> 00:58:26.791]  [Music]
[00:58:26.791 --> 00:58:28.791]  Alright folks, this is Chase Geyser out.
[00:58:28.914 --> 00:58:30.537]  Alex Jones is going to be with us in a moment.
[00:58:30.557 --> 00:58:34.943]  They're just checking on a couple of technical issues as far as him being able to hear the feed.
[00:58:35.184 --> 00:58:39.751]  So we're going to cover this breaking story about Bohemian Grove coming right up.
[00:58:41.257 --> 00:58:52.068]  But I think Alex is right on as it pertains to what we've experienced and the way we need to perceive what has happened with this assassination attempt yesterday.
[00:58:52.088 --> 00:59:02.238]  I saw that just an hour ago, it might have been the first time, I'm not for sure if it's the first time, but it may have been the first time that Joe Biden actually referred to what happened yesterday as an assassination attempt on his Twitter account.
[00:59:02.258 --> 00:59:04.441]  I don't know if the crew can pull that up.
[00:59:05.575 --> 00:59:20.444]  But the way to look at this is exactly as Alex said, it's not to focus on the minutiae of Secret Service falling short, or whether there's going to be a congressional hearing, or who's going to be held accountable, or what happened.
[00:59:20.464 --> 00:59:22.245]  I mean, these are diversions.
[00:59:22.285 --> 00:59:42.265]   The fact of the matter is, an intentional assassination attempt on the President of the United States, the former President of the United States, Donald Trump, was made and this was not just the product of a lone gunman or a lunatic or some radicalized fluke situation.
[00:59:42.525 --> 00:59:49.085]   This is because an environment has been created, set up, catalyzed, and manifest for the purpose
[00:59:49.085 --> 00:59:55.044]   of undermining the integrity of Donald Trump's campaign, for the purpose of persecuting Donald
[00:59:55.044 --> 00:59:57.044]  Trump and all of his supporters.
[00:59:57.044 --> 01:00:03.485]   And now that all those options, those courses have been gone through, to no avail, only
[01:00:03.485 --> 01:00:08.765]   increased support for Donald Trump and populism itself in the United States of America.
[01:00:08.765 --> 01:00:17.405]   The deep state's only card left is this wild card, this epic card of assassination attempts.
[01:00:17.426 --> 01:00:34.378]  And just like we've seen, like Dan Lemon and I discussed in the first hour of the show today, overseas, whether it's in Japan or South America or Central America or Europe, assassination attempt after assassination attempt, that is what the deep state does when they don't have any other options or any other recourse in order to establish their political agenda.
[01:00:34.398 --> 01:00:38.802]  And they rationalize it in their own minds because they're utilitarian, because they're Machiavellian.
[01:00:38.822 --> 01:00:53.136]   They believe that killing one innocent person or 3,000 innocent people Is acceptable if their political agenda in their minds will save the lives of millions of people or will establish peace and harmony and one world government forever.
[01:00:54.457 --> 01:00:59.563]  There is no cost too great morally in their own minds.
[01:01:01.502 --> 01:01:10.329]  In order to accomplish their political agenda, which is the conglomeration of all world political power into one world government, into one new world order, into one political establishment.
[01:01:10.369 --> 01:01:17.234]  And just as Alex Jones and others are going to reveal to you that the Republican establishment at Bohemian Grove was disappointed.
[01:01:18.939 --> 01:01:32.524]  By the fact that Donald Trump was not successfully assassinated yesterday, we are quickly realizing as a nation that our issues are not a matter of Republicans versus Democrats, or bad Democratic policy versus good Republican policy, or vice versa.
[01:01:32.784 --> 01:01:36.406]  Our issues are a matter of the people versus the political class.
[01:01:38.373 --> 01:01:50.030]  We have an entire political establishment which is dead set only on subjugating us so that we are literally subjects of them and exploiting us and selling out our interests and betraying us, literally betraying us.
[01:01:51.681 --> 01:01:57.565]  For the sake of their own self-righteous, we-are-gods mentality of total world power.
[01:01:57.585 --> 01:02:01.328]  I mean, it's like something out of a Bond movie, or Star Wars, or Lord of the Rings.
[01:02:01.348 --> 01:02:02.509]  They are Sarwan level.
[01:02:02.749 --> 01:02:04.070]  They are Darth Vader level.
[01:02:04.090 --> 01:02:07.712]  They're even worse than Darth Vader, because Darth Vader turned back to the good side at the end.
[01:02:08.533 --> 01:02:09.754]  They are Emperor Palpatine.
[01:02:11.475 --> 01:02:19.926]   And unless we do something, namely wake up to this fact, and stop Dilly-dallying around these issues.
[01:02:20.387 --> 01:02:21.229]  Oh, why did this happen?
[01:02:21.269 --> 01:02:21.870]  How did this happen?
[01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:22.952]  I guess we should forget about it.
[01:02:23.192 --> 01:02:26.718]  We can't allow what happened to Donald Trump yesterday.
[01:02:28.447 --> 01:02:31.589]  To be the same as what we allowed to happen to JFK.
[01:02:31.929 --> 01:02:33.170]  JFK was assassinated.
[01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:34.991]  They put together a congressional committee.
[01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:36.992]  They said there was likely a conspiracy.
[01:02:37.212 --> 01:02:38.573]  And then it just went away.
[01:02:39.213 --> 01:02:40.214]  It just disappeared.
[01:02:40.554 --> 01:02:41.435]  Nobody did anything.
[01:02:41.695 --> 01:02:44.496]  Nothing changed at the CIA or the FBI or in the deep state.
[01:02:44.897 --> 01:02:45.897]  Nothing changed at all.
[01:02:45.917 --> 01:02:52.821]  The only change that was really made was the President of the United States stopped using convertibles in parades.
[01:02:54.062 --> 01:03:01.909]   That's the only real manifest change that happened After the JFK assassination, are we literally going to fall for this a second time?
[01:03:02.769 --> 01:03:04.450]  Fool me once, shame on you.
[01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:06.791]  Fool me twice, shame on me.
[01:03:07.091 --> 01:03:13.755]  Are we going to allow our deep state to continue to assassinate leading political leaders?
[01:03:13.815 --> 01:03:15.235]  Not unpopular ones, even.
[01:03:16.096 --> 01:03:19.737]  They seem to only assassinate the ones that have the vast majority of support.
[01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:23.039]  They seem to be incredibly popular in the polls.
[01:03:23.559 --> 01:03:26.100]  The ones that the people love the most get assassinated.
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:33.519]   They either get cancelled, They get forced impeached, they get framed like Nixon, or they get assassinated.
[01:03:33.999 --> 01:03:36.120]  Like I was saying to Dan Lyman earlier, you have three lives.
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:43.104]  First life is cancellation, second life is imprisonment, third life is your actual physical life.
[01:03:44.484 --> 01:03:47.746]  And the first two steps seem to be failing against the populists.
[01:03:48.286 --> 01:03:54.750]  The first two steps seem to be failing against the American people who are claiming sovereignty for themselves.
[01:03:55.936 --> 01:04:00.826]  And so what do they have left but murder, bombings, terrorism, and danger?
[01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:19.817]  So, the only rational response to this assassination attempt on Donald Trump's life is that we need to escalate our insistence, our peaceful insistence, to the political class that there be accountability for this, that systemic changes be made so this can't happen again.
[01:04:19.857 --> 01:04:25.739]  We cannot rely on rogue billionaires like Elon Musk to say free speech, rogue billionaires like Donald Trump.
[01:04:25.759 --> 01:04:26.259]  Well, that's right.
[01:04:26.299 --> 01:04:26.900]  I mean, that's right.
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:28.000]  That's right, Chase.
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:28.880]  It's gotta be us.
[01:04:29.581 --> 01:04:32.402]  And it's gotta be citizen activists, citizen journalists.
[01:04:32.952 --> 01:04:34.453]  A couple of them got arrested today.
[01:04:36.274 --> 01:04:36.935]  Or last night.
[01:04:38.256 --> 01:04:46.742]  Sneaking into Bohemian Grove where Republican leaders are against Trump and are meeting and scheming and stealing and doing what they're doing right now.
[01:04:46.762 --> 01:04:47.702]  So we're out here in California.
[01:04:47.722 --> 01:04:48.883]  They exposed Bohemian Grove.
[01:04:49.223 --> 01:04:50.224]  They've got incredible footage.
[01:04:50.244 --> 01:04:53.006]  We posted some of it on X. More is coming.
[01:04:53.026 --> 01:04:54.727]  These guys are going to make a documentary film.
[01:04:54.747 --> 01:04:56.208]  Some of them have been charged with felonies.
[01:04:56.448 --> 01:05:01.632]  You know, they're journalists just there for the public right to know where public policy is being made like Daniel Ellsberg or Julian Assange.
[01:05:02.637 --> 01:05:04.237]  So guys, great to have you here with us.
[01:05:05.138 --> 01:05:05.498]  Yeah.
[01:05:05.518 --> 01:05:07.978]  Why don't you just introduce yourselves here for all the TV viewers?
[01:05:08.218 --> 01:05:09.519]  So, I'm Reckless Ben.
[01:05:09.539 --> 01:05:11.319]  I'm Danny Burke.
[01:05:12.239 --> 01:05:13.140]  Hi, I'm Lydia.
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:14.760]  I'm Sean Gorman.
[01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:16.160]  Sup, I'm Andrew.
[01:05:18.301 --> 01:05:20.641]  We have one more person, but he wants to remain anonymous.
[01:05:21.442 --> 01:05:23.142]  But, uh, he was my dancer.
[01:05:23.362 --> 01:05:26.023]  So just, we talked this morning when I met with you guys.
[01:05:26.063 --> 01:05:27.383]  You guys just called us a week ago.
[01:05:27.423 --> 01:05:29.443]  We were already in Infiltrate, but you guys did, so that's great.
[01:05:29.884 --> 01:05:31.404]  Tell us what you saw, what you witnessed.
[01:05:31.963 --> 01:05:34.326]  So, uh, yeah, we saw some crazy stuff.
[01:05:34.366 --> 01:05:38.832]  We were actually doing this for over two weeks, going every single day for two weeks straight.
[01:05:39.733 --> 01:05:42.293]  It's probably Bohemian Grove is for people who don't know.
[01:05:42.293 --> 01:05:49.092]   So it's basically the most elite, powerful people in America all come together and it's
[01:05:49.092 --> 01:05:51.853]   like the biggest mystery in the entire world of like what do they do?
[01:05:52.185 --> 01:05:55.785]  Because they go to extreme lengths to keep it all secretive.
[01:05:56.365 --> 01:06:00.006]  And they want like, like literally the most extreme lengths ever.
[01:06:00.066 --> 01:06:03.667]  Like they scare all the employees to like stay secret.
[01:06:03.687 --> 01:06:06.227]  Like if you try to ask an employee what's happening, like they won't tell anything.
[01:06:06.747 --> 01:06:09.228]  And for some reason it's all secret and no one knows why.
[01:06:09.248 --> 01:06:12.868]  And what made you guys, when did you decide as 20 people to infiltrate?
[01:06:13.288 --> 01:06:15.769]  Like you said, they arrested two of you, but that's nothing.
[01:06:15.789 --> 01:06:16.669]  You guys have got this out.
[01:06:17.749 --> 01:06:18.730]  Um, I don't know.
[01:06:18.790 --> 01:06:25.115]  I just went in by myself at first and then I was like, oh, the security here is like nothing like what it is in the media.
[01:06:25.155 --> 01:06:27.096]  You know, like I was like, I'm going to expose that.
[01:06:27.196 --> 01:06:29.237]  So why not just invite all my friends?
[01:06:29.257 --> 01:06:32.440]  You know, I was like, I was like, this place is fun, you know, it was fun inside.
[01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:34.321]  So I was like, I want my friends to enjoy this also.
[01:06:34.341 --> 01:06:35.182]  So I invited all my friends.
[01:06:35.202 --> 01:06:36.603]  And you said they were obsessed with me though.
[01:06:37.263 --> 01:06:38.905]  They were very obsessed with you, yes.
[01:06:39.065 --> 01:06:53.620]  Pretty much anywhere we'd go and we would talk about something that like, oh, we tried to like get them to admit something, they'd be like, oh, Alex Jones said that, oh, he's making this place look bad, Alex Jones this, Alex Jones that, and you're like a freaking wanted man there, dude.
[01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:54.621]  They love you there, dude.
[01:06:55.942 --> 01:06:57.143]  Keep going, tell me what you saw.
[01:06:58.224 --> 01:06:59.364]  I mean... Millions are watching.
[01:06:59.464 --> 01:07:03.187]  Okay, yesterday... Literally, like 5 million people literally are watching.
[01:07:03.327 --> 01:07:08.251]  Yesterday we walked down, and like, right when we enter, they're wearing the robes.
[01:07:08.491 --> 01:07:16.596]  Like, right when we enter, the cremation of care is about to start, and they're wearing these robes, and we're walking over to the cremation of care.
[01:07:16.876 --> 01:07:18.958]  There was like, how many people in these robes, dude?
[01:07:19.682 --> 01:07:21.083]  I thought it was like 50, I'd say.
[01:07:21.263 --> 01:07:21.703]  Like 50 or 60.
[01:07:22.443 --> 01:07:24.044]  Also, there weren't black robes this time.
[01:07:24.324 --> 01:07:33.588]  I think in the Alex Jones video, it was, they were like wearing like black robes, but now they're all super colorful, which is, maybe they're supporting pride or something.
[01:07:33.608 --> 01:07:35.108]  I don't know, but it was like rainbow colored robes.
[01:07:35.729 --> 01:07:36.509]  It was all different colors.
[01:07:39.015 --> 01:07:45.376]  Yeah, I actually didn't make it to the big event on Saturday night, but I actually got in there on Thursday and actually was at the opening ceremony of the Bohemian Grove.
[01:07:45.416 --> 01:07:51.398]  It's like the main event to get the whole party started for all these wealthy individuals who go here and party.
[01:07:51.518 --> 01:07:55.119]  And yeah, it was just the main event and I was there and it was really weird.
[01:07:55.139 --> 01:07:57.119]  It was some interesting stuff coming on.
[01:07:57.859 --> 01:08:03.560]  They had an axe that they split a really big piece of wood and they all were having a whole bunch of wine, champagne.
[01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.541]  It was just some really uncomfortable stuff.
[01:08:06.161 --> 01:08:12.231]  I did see some things and the type of secrecy that they wanted to keep was just, you can't even take out your phone at all.
[01:08:12.251 --> 01:08:14.154]  If you take out your phone, they literally snap it.
[01:08:14.555 --> 01:08:21.006]  I sadly wasn't able to get a lot of my footage out, but it was some really interesting stuff that I saw there and yeah.
[01:08:22.029 --> 01:08:25.532]  And we went in this thinking they were all Republicans as well.
[01:08:26.013 --> 01:08:30.416]  And so I asked one of the members, like, oh, do you think Biden's really a six handicap?
[01:08:30.476 --> 01:08:34.620]  And then one of the guys like is like, oh, I actually golf with Biden.
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:35.861]  He's an eight handicap.
[01:08:36.101 --> 01:08:38.383]  And, you know, Trump's a Trump's a cheater.
[01:08:38.403 --> 01:08:40.325]  He kicks the ball like he's not.
[01:08:40.365 --> 01:08:46.830]  He's not like basically calm out, basically saying he's a fake golfer and the society is going to be the worst.
[01:08:47.271 --> 01:08:49.613]  Like it's going down if he becomes president.
[01:08:50.447 --> 01:08:58.189]  Yeah, it's weird because the first time I tried infiltrating Bohemian Grove, we wore a Make America Great Again hat because we thought it would fit in with them.
[01:08:58.229 --> 01:09:00.410]  We were like, oh, that's how we fit in.
[01:09:00.770 --> 01:09:03.171]  But I guess, yeah, we were completely wrong.
[01:09:03.711 --> 01:09:07.212]  I thought they were all going to be super pro-Trump, but they hate him, dude.
[01:09:07.692 --> 01:09:09.453]  I saw you guys this morning.
[01:09:10.133 --> 01:09:13.334]  What did they say yesterday after Trump got shot?
[01:09:14.014 --> 01:09:15.595]  I don't know if we talked to them about that.
[01:09:15.615 --> 01:09:17.275]  One of you guys I talked to said they were happy.
[01:09:17.295 --> 01:09:18.556]  I remember this morning we talked.
[01:09:18.856 --> 01:09:19.616]  I overheard someone.
[01:09:20.116 --> 01:09:21.150]  Hand it, hand it to him.
[01:09:22.623 --> 01:09:28.247]  I really didn't like get the full opinion on it, but they just seemed like they were just in shock over it.
[01:09:28.327 --> 01:09:32.009]  Like they didn't know what to think of it, but I didn't really, it was just like a splash.
[01:09:32.029 --> 01:09:35.591]  I talked to like eight of you this morning and one of you was like, you know, they seemed like upsetting.
[01:09:36.452 --> 01:09:42.575]  Um, yeah, for the most part, um, when Trump got shot, like we said, we thought it was going to be a majority of Republican plays were infiltrating.
[01:09:42.615 --> 01:09:47.739]  I wouldn't say they were celebrating that he got shot, but they obviously didn't care as much as we thought they should care about.
[01:09:47.979 --> 01:10:00.748]   You know, the guy that is, can lead our country one day just got, Harm, very harmfully and they didn't seem to care too much which is really surprising so that's how you know that these guys are just kind of just really off and yeah.
[01:10:02.349 --> 01:10:08.954]  But we had a foolproof plan and basically we made it work and we got the footage so.
[01:10:09.074 --> 01:10:10.395]  Well that's really the great news.
[01:10:10.435 --> 01:10:11.416]  Talk about your arrest.
[01:10:11.436 --> 01:10:15.599]  You described that this morning and others but like 20 people you learned were in there.
[01:10:15.939 --> 01:10:17.680]  They think I'm running this, I'm not running any of this.
[01:10:18.041 --> 01:10:19.562]  But you're a journalist, you're protected.
[01:10:19.582 --> 01:10:20.983]  They've charged some of you guys with felonies.
[01:10:21.323 --> 01:10:28.850]  Yeah, I don't know how much I want to talk about, but I guess I got a misdemeanor, trespassing, and a couple felonies.
[01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:29.971]  You showed me the arrest forms.
[01:10:30.031 --> 01:10:33.314]  Yeah, I was in jail last night.
[01:10:33.354 --> 01:10:38.759]  Yeah, misdemeanor for trespassing, I think conspiracies, and what's the other one?
[01:10:38.999 --> 01:10:40.580]  Eavesdropping.
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:42.042]  Yeah, I got eavesdropping.
[01:10:42.062 --> 01:10:45.665]  But you weren't eavesdropping on civilians, you were eavesdropping on political operations.
[01:10:45.845 --> 01:10:46.206]  Yeah.
[01:10:46.426 --> 01:10:47.647]  You're protected by free speech.
[01:10:48.849 --> 01:10:54.511]  And, um, basically during the cremation of Kara, I guess they already knew our YouTube channels.
[01:10:54.651 --> 01:10:59.353]  So there is basically they had photos of us and basically they had security.
[01:10:59.393 --> 01:11:03.795]  The security is actually like kids and that's how it was so easy to get in in the first place.
[01:11:04.195 --> 01:11:09.097]  But I guess we were on high alert because they found our YouTube channels that we go undercover and stuff like that.
[01:11:09.757 --> 01:11:14.699]  And so, um, they questioned me and asked where, what camp I'm in.
[01:11:14.799 --> 01:11:15.659]  And I'm like, Oh, I'm a bro.
[01:11:19.116 --> 01:11:26.304]  My dad's Robert and then they called Bromley or on the intercom or something and they're like, oh, well, there's no Robert there.
[01:11:26.444 --> 01:11:31.310]  And then they ended up putting me in zip ties and like held me hostage for like an hour.
[01:11:31.951 --> 01:11:33.252]  Zip tied for an hour.
[01:11:33.272 --> 01:11:35.274]  There was like five guys and they were questioning me.
[01:11:35.835 --> 01:11:41.494]   And I was so scared because like these are like big elites that they can make something
[01:11:41.494 --> 01:11:42.494]  go away quick.
[01:11:42.494 --> 01:11:43.814]  So I didn't know if I was going to get shot.
[01:11:43.814 --> 01:11:46.854]   I didn't know what was going to, because why if they're going to zip tie me, just take
[01:11:46.854 --> 01:11:47.854]  me to the police.
[01:11:47.854 --> 01:11:50.215]  But what's crazy is I snuck in 24 years ago.
[01:11:50.215 --> 01:11:52.213]  I don't want to bring myself to the story.
[01:11:52.213 --> 01:11:53.213]  It's just great.
[01:11:53.213 --> 01:11:54.654]  They kept bringing me up while you worked there.
[01:11:54.729 --> 01:11:55.849]  Yeah, they kept bringing me up.
[01:11:55.889 --> 01:12:00.112]  So I was just like, I kind of made it seem like you were you were kind of our leader.
[01:12:00.352 --> 01:12:05.335]  And basically, it was basically like, yeah, we've been in talks with Alex Jones.
[01:12:05.475 --> 01:12:06.676]  And good luck.
[01:12:06.796 --> 01:12:11.178]  Good luck finding everyone because you're dealing with the goats, the greatest of all time.
[01:12:11.498 --> 01:12:15.441]  You pick the person that actually doesn't have any cameras on him at all.
[01:12:15.521 --> 01:12:16.701]  I'd had nothing on me.
[01:12:16.781 --> 01:12:18.322]  And so it's not be yesterday.
[01:12:18.342 --> 01:12:19.323]  There were 20 people inside.
[01:12:19.443 --> 01:12:20.243]  Yeah.
[01:12:20.523 --> 01:12:21.904]  And you've given us the footage.
[01:12:22.144 --> 01:12:23.985]  They got yours, but they failed.
[01:12:24.145 --> 01:12:32.547]  And I said, good luck finding them, but they didn't find them because we got some elites ourselves that know how to get out of places without getting caught.
[01:12:32.627 --> 01:12:35.048]  But I guess I was the decoy that got caught.
[01:12:35.508 --> 01:12:35.729]  Yeah.
[01:12:36.109 --> 01:12:42.171]  We got 20 people inside and they caught the only one without spy cameras, which was Danny.
[01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:42.451]  Yeah.
[01:12:42.931 --> 01:12:43.751]  Well, his name was Lou.
[01:12:43.771 --> 01:12:45.972]  That was his fake character's name, but his real name is Danny.
[01:12:48.287 --> 01:12:50.357]  Live footage, I don't know what's going to happen to that.
[01:12:51.658 --> 01:12:52.998]  They arrested me last night.
[01:12:53.018 --> 01:12:55.659]  I literally just got out of jail like 20 minutes ago.
[01:12:55.679 --> 01:12:57.399]  They picked me up and brought me straight here.
[01:12:57.519 --> 01:12:59.460]  So this is pretty crazy to be on this podcast.
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:01.120]  Podcast half of zero sleep.
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:06.142]  But yeah, they brought me in and they surrounded me and tackled me.
[01:13:06.182 --> 01:13:09.542]  They like dogpiled me with like five different security guards.
[01:13:10.043 --> 01:13:15.204]  Just instantly knew I was up because I feel like everyone was on high alert ever since they knew that you guys were infiltrating.
[01:13:15.524 --> 01:13:17.064]  And I obviously stand out.
[01:13:17.084 --> 01:13:18.785]  I'm super young, like don't look how I belong there.
[01:13:18.805 --> 01:13:28.928]   And Basically, they were like looking for everyone after you said that there was 20 people inside, I think.
[01:13:29.209 --> 01:13:33.231]  So initially, some security guard walks up to me when I'm inside some little comedy show thing.
[01:13:33.792 --> 01:13:36.033]  And he's, uh, he's like, Hey, man, what's your name?
[01:13:36.053 --> 01:13:39.576]  And I was just like, Oh, Drew, uh, nice to meet you.
[01:13:39.616 --> 01:13:40.937]  And he's just like, nice to meet you.
[01:13:40.957 --> 01:13:41.417]  He shook my hand.
[01:13:41.437 --> 01:13:42.398]  So I was like, I gotta get out of here.
[01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:43.819]  I'm trying to find the exit.
[01:13:43.839 --> 01:13:47.402]  That was the main issue for me that got me caught because I didn't know where to leave from.
[01:13:47.882 --> 01:13:55.222]   And I was thinking going in the way that we entered was going to be way too sketch because that's like, Three miles through the mountains at night.
[01:13:56.263 --> 01:13:57.684]  Why do you think they're so secretive?
[01:13:59.845 --> 01:14:00.606]  I don't know.
[01:14:00.666 --> 01:14:07.390]  I don't want to say too much because I have pending charges currently, but I think that they may or may not have something going on.
[01:14:07.470 --> 01:14:09.932]  I really don't want to elaborate on it too much.
[01:14:09.952 --> 01:14:10.933]  No, no.
[01:14:10.973 --> 01:14:14.095]  What do you think?
[01:14:14.135 --> 01:14:14.415]  Tell us.
[01:14:16.477 --> 01:14:22.831]   I think that whatever it is, I really don't know, but I think that Whatever it could be.
[01:14:22.851 --> 01:14:27.354]  I don't think that it's like a mass thing that everyone knows about there.
[01:14:27.394 --> 01:14:37.862]  I feel like if there is some super elite secret shit going on there, I feel like there's like an even smaller group of more elite people that have like some kind of like back trail.
[01:14:38.262 --> 01:14:38.823]  Oh no, that's it.
[01:14:38.843 --> 01:14:40.104]  They're trying to compromise people there.
[01:14:41.945 --> 01:14:44.427]  They're trying to get people in sexual compromise positions.
[01:14:46.127 --> 01:14:50.569]  So yeah, one thing that a lot of people don't realize about Bohemia Grove, it's like an open campground.
[01:14:50.589 --> 01:14:55.472]  So you can actually go, it's basically two miles up in the massive redwood forest, and you can go to different camps.
[01:14:55.492 --> 01:14:56.813]  There's 150 camps in this.
[01:14:57.173 --> 01:15:01.895]  So I actually made my way around to at least four or five, and then I ended up slipping up.
[01:15:01.975 --> 01:15:10.159]  But yeah, the point is, there's so many camps, there's so many rich individuals meeting here, and I think they're kind of determining the laws in some type of sense.
[01:15:10.179 --> 01:15:13.801]  There's so much rich people there, there's so much wealthy people there who have kind of lead the world.
[01:15:13.821 --> 01:15:14.602]  There's so many camps.
[01:15:15.202 --> 01:15:20.101]   I did see some stuff, I was actually a leader of a DJ, I got close to some of the guys in there,
[01:15:20.101 --> 01:15:24.442]   I ended up talking to a lot of them, and that's ended up why I actually did get caught too,
[01:15:24.442 --> 01:15:27.442]   because I don't necessarily look like I belong there, to be honest.
[01:15:27.442 --> 01:15:33.581]   So I got too comfortable, and that's what I honestly think, and if you guys even want to try to get in,
[01:15:33.581 --> 01:15:35.561]  it's a lot easier than you would even think.
[01:15:35.561 --> 01:15:38.761]  We legit just walked the hell in.
[01:15:38.761 --> 01:15:42.442]  I'm telling you, the security are like kids.
[01:15:42.442 --> 01:15:43.900]  It's all an illusion.
[01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:45.481]  It's an illusion.
[01:15:45.481 --> 01:15:53.248]   And I ended up going to Sun Dodgers, They took me to Hillbillies, which I only know of Hillbillies because that's what you said.
[01:15:53.268 --> 01:15:59.011]  So I was, like, so stoked to go there because I was like, that's what Alex Jones said he stayed at on his fake backstory.
[01:15:59.091 --> 01:16:02.272]  And, uh, but I was kind of scared there because there could be Secret Service there.
[01:16:02.292 --> 01:16:03.233]  So I didn't want to stay there long.
[01:16:03.273 --> 01:16:09.456]  So I just had one beer and just kept going from camp to camp and trying to gain everyone's trust with my backstory.
[01:16:09.476 --> 01:16:12.657]  Do you think they're trying to sexually compromise people there?
[01:16:12.677 --> 01:16:15.079]  Yeah, 100%.
[01:16:17.474 --> 01:16:18.914]  That's what Jeffrey Epstein was doing, right?
[01:16:18.934 --> 01:16:21.255]  Yeah, it's like Jeffrey Epstein 2.0.
[01:16:23.055 --> 01:16:25.816]  I didn't get hit on at all when I was there, but I think it's just because I'm ugly.
[01:16:25.836 --> 01:16:25.876]  No.
[01:16:27.696 --> 01:16:30.617]  No, but they did hit on me when I was in there.
[01:16:31.157 --> 01:16:33.977]  Yeah, they didn't hit on me though, but I'm not as good looking.
[01:16:35.117 --> 01:16:35.357]  Right.
[01:16:35.878 --> 01:16:36.638]  You're a good looking guy.
[01:16:36.678 --> 01:16:39.938]  The point is, is that they just tried to kill Trump yesterday.
[01:16:39.958 --> 01:16:40.678]  What do you guys make of that?
[01:16:42.199 --> 01:16:42.599]  I don't know.
[01:16:44.013 --> 01:16:50.075]  A lot of people don't like him and it wouldn't surprise me if there was some crazy like 20 year old that would want to kill him.
[01:16:50.135 --> 01:16:50.895]  But I don't know.
[01:16:50.935 --> 01:16:56.037]  I mean, maybe I mean, all the people that were high up at Bohemian Grove also didn't like Trump.
[01:16:56.077 --> 01:16:56.997]  So is that?
[01:16:57.157 --> 01:16:57.578]  I don't know.
[01:16:57.598 --> 01:16:59.478]  I don't know.
[01:17:00.238 --> 01:17:00.839]  I have no opinions.
[01:17:00.859 --> 01:17:02.479]  What do you think happens now that they failed?
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:05.740]  What do I think happens?
[01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:07.641]  I think they're going to try again.
[01:17:07.661 --> 01:17:09.382]  Yeah, obviously.
[01:17:09.422 --> 01:17:10.282]  I agree with you totally.
[01:17:11.022 --> 01:17:12.082]  So that's the big issue.
[01:17:13.263 --> 01:17:13.523]  Yeah.
[01:17:14.522 --> 01:17:14.802]  I don't know.
[01:17:14.842 --> 01:17:15.863]  I have no opinions on that.
[01:17:15.883 --> 01:17:18.246]  I didn't talk to anyone about Trump getting shot.
[01:17:18.346 --> 01:17:20.969]  All I know is that they just really hate Trump at Bohemian Grove.
[01:17:21.009 --> 01:17:27.555]  Yeah, I got arrested too fast to ask questions about the Trump stuff, but... Oh wait, I have one more thing.
[01:17:27.576 --> 01:17:29.558]  I actually talked to another bus driver.
[01:17:29.598 --> 01:17:31.079]  That was my fake job there.
[01:17:31.099 --> 01:17:32.380]  I was a bus driver.
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:33.502]  I was pretending to be a bus driver.
[01:17:34.262 --> 01:17:39.265]  And one of the other bus drivers was like, they were talking about the famous people that were there and they were like, oh, I heard Trump's coming this year, right?
[01:17:39.666 --> 01:17:43.888]  And the other was like, our boss was like, no, they do not want Trump to come.
[01:17:43.948 --> 01:17:45.109]  Trump would never be allowed here.
[01:17:45.129 --> 01:17:48.971]  But that's a positive for Trump to hate him.
[01:17:48.991 --> 01:17:49.251]  Yeah.
[01:17:49.291 --> 01:17:51.833]  But yeah, they were like, no, Trump would never show up to this.
[01:17:52.073 --> 01:17:54.615]  That is no-go for sure.
[01:17:54.635 --> 01:17:56.376]  Because Trump's not in the men.
[01:17:57.665 --> 01:17:59.226]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:17:59.266 --> 01:18:00.908]  I mean, I don't know Trump's sexual preference.
[01:18:00.928 --> 01:18:02.068]  I've never talked to him about that.
[01:18:02.169 --> 01:18:03.910]  But yeah, I would.
[01:18:04.130 --> 01:18:07.413]  I mean, he does have a wife, so I would assume that, yeah, he's into women.
[01:18:07.453 --> 01:18:07.673]  Yeah.
[01:18:09.214 --> 01:18:12.296]  Hey, I mean, just because someone has a wife doesn't mean they're just into women.
[01:18:12.657 --> 01:18:16.960]  No, but in the old days, compromising Republicans was homosexuality.
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:20.563]  So you went there to do that, to be in the elite of the Republican Party.
[01:18:21.243 --> 01:18:23.065]  So it's basically a Republican gay hookup.
[01:18:24.339 --> 01:18:38.813]  I think maybe we just saw that happen but I was too scared to stay at one camp for too long because then they would question me more so I kept going from camp to camp so maybe I didn't have a good enough conversation to get hit on but I could see that happening there for sure.
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:44.701]  Like I said, I got pretty close to a couple camps.
[01:18:44.821 --> 01:18:46.102]  I was going around a lot of camps.
[01:18:46.122 --> 01:18:52.665]  I was talking to a lot of the people and actually, I don't know if it was getting hit on, but a group did offer me to stay the night at their camp.
[01:18:53.105 --> 01:18:54.385]  Obviously, I was going to say no.
[01:18:54.425 --> 01:18:56.966]  The way it works in the Bohemia Grove, it's called sleeping around.
[01:18:57.066 --> 01:18:59.948]   It's an exclusive term that It's literally called sleeping around.
[01:18:59.968 --> 01:19:04.430]  It's when you're in the first phases of being a member, you still have to find the camp you're according to.
[01:19:04.450 --> 01:19:08.992]  So to find the camp you're according to, you have to sleep around in other tents.
[01:19:09.172 --> 01:19:10.573]  And that has a negative connotation.
[01:19:10.773 --> 01:19:14.415]  You really like sleeping around with men is just like, it just sounds weird in general.
[01:19:14.435 --> 01:19:17.456]  So to even have that term as a basis is weird.
[01:19:17.816 --> 01:19:22.158]   And another thing I want to emphasize is They are so secretive about the footage that we got.
[01:19:22.218 --> 01:19:27.079]  They were, when all of us got, um, me and Danny got detained, they were hounding us for a long time.
[01:19:27.099 --> 01:19:28.100]  They're like, what's on your phone?
[01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:28.980]  What's on your phone?
[01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:29.800]  What's on your phone?
[01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:31.261]  So, during the break, you guys are here.
[01:19:31.361 --> 01:19:32.461]  You got hours of this.
[01:19:32.921 --> 01:19:33.681]  You got hours of this.
[01:19:33.721 --> 01:19:35.682]  We need to start getting this on X right now, real quick, Alex Jones.
[01:19:36.042 --> 01:19:38.283]  Oh yeah, there's a lot of good conversations that we had.
[01:19:38.363 --> 01:19:39.884]  Sally, like I said... You guys are gonna make a documentary?
[01:19:40.104 --> 01:19:46.106]  Oh yeah, we're definitely... Reckless Ben and Danny Burke and... Yeah, so uh... So yeah, so Ben and I are YouTubers.
[01:19:46.126 --> 01:19:50.888]  It's gonna be on Reckless Ben, Danny Burke, and uh... Andrew, are you making something as well?
[01:19:50.908 --> 01:19:54.790]  AndrewProTV, that's my channel if y'all... AndrewProTV.
[01:19:55.170 --> 01:19:56.731]  But let's get some of it out now.
[01:19:57.011 --> 01:19:58.972]  Like, some of it's already on a lot of shows, let's get it out now.
[01:19:59.850 --> 01:20:00.490]  Oh, Dancer.
[01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:01.971]  Oh, and Dancer as well.
[01:20:02.291 --> 01:20:02.951]  Sorry about that.
[01:20:03.011 --> 01:20:05.092]  Yes, Dancer is posting a video as well.
[01:20:05.192 --> 01:20:13.476]  He just has to stay anonymous because he does a lot of these sneak-ins and if he shows his face, they're gonna get him in like 10 seconds, so he's gotta be anonymous.
[01:20:13.496 --> 01:20:19.659]  That's the good news is that 20 people are in there, which is emblematic of the huge public global awakening.
[01:20:19.679 --> 01:20:21.480]  Like, it's over for the world.
[01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:23.361]  I mean, humanity is taking action.
[01:20:23.381 --> 01:20:24.061]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:24.938 --> 01:20:28.520]  Bohemian Grove, 2024, totally infiltrated.
[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:29.980]  They just tried to kill Trump.
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:31.121]  Everything is insane.
[01:20:31.461 --> 01:20:32.281]  Humanity's rising.
[01:20:32.301 --> 01:20:33.902]  There'll be a thousand people next year.
[01:20:33.922 --> 01:20:38.144]  It's emblematic of the collapse of the deep state.
[01:20:38.384 --> 01:20:39.104]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:39.204 --> 01:20:40.265]  Follow us on Real Alex Jones.
[01:20:40.425 --> 01:20:42.425]  Stay with us.

[01:21:03.912 --> 01:21:06.453]  We're talking to the journalist at Group The Dead at Heritage.
[01:21:09.635 --> 01:21:15.678]  They don't have that footage, do they?
[01:21:16.358 --> 01:21:19.119]  I hear it, I hear it.
[01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:23.442]  I'm gonna use it.
[01:21:24.382 --> 01:21:28.784]  I have no audio.
[01:21:28.824 --> 01:21:29.945]  They haven't sent me audio yet.
[01:21:32.019 --> 01:21:35.019]  [Music]

[01:22:32.019 --> 01:22:34.259]  (laughing)
[01:22:34.265 --> 01:22:39.265]  May all within the globe be reverence before him.
[01:22:39.265 --> 01:22:42.864]  (dramatic music)
[01:22:42.864 --> 01:22:45.604]  (birds chirping)
[01:22:45.604 --> 01:22:48.345]  (dramatic music)
[01:22:48.345 --> 01:22:51.104]  (dramatic music)

[01:23:07.524 --> 01:23:14.265]  (dramatic music)
[01:23:15.825 --> 01:23:20.265]   All right, so we've got hours and hours and hours and hours and hours of footage.
[01:23:20.265 --> 01:23:23.744]  And it'll be out soon at Real Live Show on X.
[01:23:23.744 --> 01:23:27.905]   Here are the investigative journalists, some of which have been charged with felonies
[01:23:27.905 --> 01:23:32.024]   for daring to go show the global elite, the Republican Party, doing their druidic rituals.
[01:23:32.681 --> 01:23:33.682]  Guys, this is amazing.
[01:23:35.683 --> 01:23:41.105]  Yeah, I just realized I'm the only one here sitting at this table that hasn't gotten arrested for going in Bohemian Grove.
[01:23:42.265 --> 01:23:43.886]  I was the only one able to escape.
[01:23:43.906 --> 01:23:44.946]  Well, she hasn't been arrested either.
[01:23:45.246 --> 01:23:46.726]  Yeah, well, she was the getaway driver, yeah.
[01:23:46.746 --> 01:23:50.007]  Well, now you just compromised me in the law.
[01:23:50.067 --> 01:23:53.628]  I'm sorry, she was the moral support back at the Airbnb that did not drive us then.
[01:23:54.449 --> 01:23:56.489]  I was a driver to pick everyone up from jail.
[01:23:56.509 --> 01:24:07.246]   Yeah, but yeah, I definitely want to say though that, I mean, getting 20 people in this year was pretty easy, but next year, We're gonna get in a hundred people.
[01:24:07.266 --> 01:24:11.550]  Uh, because I, I mean, I honestly don't think they have the funds to like up security.
[01:24:11.590 --> 01:24:14.092]  It's like a mile from one side of the Grove to the other.
[01:24:14.112 --> 01:24:20.197]  And I think what they say online is like, Oh, it's all like guarded with like motion sensors and cameras and stuff.
[01:24:20.257 --> 01:24:23.940]  But I don't think there's, I, I did a whole like, no, it's like everything with the globals.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:24.560]  It's a hoax.
[01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:25.821]  It's, it's a facade.
[01:24:25.841 --> 01:24:26.582]  I do think it's a hoax.
[01:24:26.742 --> 01:24:27.723]  I did a whole bit.
[01:24:28.323 --> 01:24:32.688]  And it'll be in our documentary where like I did something so I could sneak it into the security.
[01:24:32.868 --> 01:24:38.834]  We had a whole like backstory so I could sneak in security and we got like footage of all their cameras and their only cameras are in the parking lot.
[01:24:39.294 --> 01:24:43.819]  So I think next year and they just don't have the money to like put up like security cameras.
[01:24:43.839 --> 01:24:45.640]  So I think next year we can definitely get in 100 people.
[01:24:45.781 --> 01:24:47.462]  I just love how they thought I was there.
[01:24:47.482 --> 01:24:48.243]  Yeah.
[01:24:48.764 --> 01:24:49.825]  Yeah, they thought you were there.
[01:24:49.845 --> 01:24:50.285]  Yeah.
[01:24:51.855 --> 01:24:56.377]  I think, uh, you were on the Wanted poster, it was like, Wanted, Alex Jones, that also, yeah, us two.
[01:24:56.397 --> 01:24:58.697]  You gotta describe that, they had three, you had three images.
[01:24:58.717 --> 01:25:09.981]  Yeah, so when I was, uh, zip-tied and held hostage for, like, an hour, um, they were talking about, like, who are you with, like, like, who, like, who's your friends, like, where are your friends at?
[01:25:10.021 --> 01:25:11.902]  I was like, you're not gonna find them, you're with the best.
[01:25:12.422 --> 01:25:14.304]  And uh, and they're like, Alex Jones?
[01:25:14.685 --> 01:25:16.326]  And I go, I go, what do you mean?
[01:25:16.507 --> 01:25:19.690]  And then he goes over to like a photo, and there's three photos.
[01:25:20.130 --> 01:25:22.473]  It's Ben, it's me, and it's you.
[01:25:22.493 --> 01:25:25.857]  And uh, I said good luck, cause uh, you're not gonna find them.
[01:25:26.077 --> 01:25:44.905]   And then um, I basically made like a fake thing, like we were fake friends with you, Basically to gain your trust to debunk like everything you said about it just to make them think like oh Ben and Danny are doing a good thing, but obviously that's not not the case, but I was just trying to say anything cuz I felt like
[01:25:45.646 --> 01:25:47.947]  If I'm held hostage, I don't know what they can do.
[01:25:48.007 --> 01:25:49.488]  They can start punching me.
[01:25:49.528 --> 01:25:51.628]  I really was so scared.
[01:25:51.968 --> 01:25:53.429]  Why couldn't they just get me arrested?
[01:25:53.529 --> 01:25:55.330]  I was literally zip-tied.
[01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:59.851]  I was trying to leave, and the guy wouldn't let me leave.
[01:25:59.951 --> 01:26:02.172]  I was like, hey, you can come with me to the police.
[01:26:02.552 --> 01:26:03.073]  Let me leave.
[01:26:03.093 --> 01:26:04.593]  And he's like, bro, come on.
[01:26:04.833 --> 01:26:05.694]  You were trespassing.
[01:26:05.714 --> 01:26:07.214]  I'm like, just let me leave.
[01:26:07.314 --> 01:26:08.735]  It was really weird.
[01:26:08.755 --> 01:26:10.155]  But it shows the power of the people.
[01:26:10.235 --> 01:26:12.796]  What are they going to do now that everybody can get a job there and infiltrate?
[01:26:13.156 --> 01:26:14.257]  We didn't talk before you did this.
[01:26:15.799 --> 01:26:19.687]  Yes, I got the job super last minute as a bus driver.
[01:26:19.707 --> 01:26:23.956]  I called one of the guys on the phone and I got the job in less than a minute.
[01:26:24.617 --> 01:26:25.757]  Yeah, less than a minute.
[01:26:25.858 --> 01:26:29.099]  I mean, we like kind of tricked them into being employees of the place.
[01:26:30.219 --> 01:26:38.803]  So I gave him, so I got the job first and then it was like, okay, like tell this guy that this guy gave you his number and say that you're already hired and stuff.
[01:26:38.903 --> 01:26:41.324]  And we basically just like gaslighted the heck out of them.
[01:26:41.664 --> 01:26:43.965]  And we kind of just like took over their whole employment system.
[01:26:43.985 --> 01:26:46.686]  Well, my issue is they hate Trump and they're glad he got shot.
[01:26:46.706 --> 01:26:50.147]  I mean, this is, this is disgusting Republican establishment.
[01:26:50.729 --> 01:26:55.771]  Meeting over here, making all these side deals, and they're so scared it's creating a Streisand effect.
[01:26:55.791 --> 01:26:56.351]  You know what that is?
[01:26:57.331 --> 01:26:57.651]  No, sir.
[01:26:58.332 --> 01:27:07.295]  Well, the Streisand effect is, 20 years ago or 15 years ago, whatever it was, 18 years ago, I forget the exact date, she has this giant house on the beach in California.
[01:27:08.715 --> 01:27:09.376]  Barbara Streisand.
[01:27:10.456 --> 01:27:11.996]  And she didn't want anybody to cover it.
[01:27:12.497 --> 01:27:15.077]  So by her threatening to me not to cover it, it made it bigger.
[01:27:15.458 --> 01:27:16.478]  That's called the Streisand effect.
[01:27:17.682 --> 01:27:23.324]  Yeah, and this is just a personal message to everyone that I saw, I met at Bohemio Grove.
[01:27:24.645 --> 01:27:26.065]  Don't waste your money here, guys.
[01:27:26.085 --> 01:27:27.386]  Your safety is in jeopardy.
[01:27:27.426 --> 01:27:32.968]  If I can sneak in a random 24-year-old, what if someone who was really, you know, who's dangerous can sneak in there?
[01:27:33.028 --> 01:27:33.988]  You guys are not safe.
[01:27:34.049 --> 01:27:37.870]  This place is a pure scam just to make you guys feel important.
[01:27:37.930 --> 01:27:41.732]  And, you know, a couple YouTubers, a couple random people were able to sneak in so easily.
[01:27:41.752 --> 01:27:44.133]  It's a scam.
[01:27:45.613 --> 01:27:46.414]  Not what it seems.
[01:27:46.454 --> 01:27:47.735]  I'll tell you guys that.
[01:27:47.856 --> 01:27:50.058]  And on the point of arrest, zip ties.
[01:27:50.418 --> 01:27:53.581]  Yeah, they ended up zip tying me too, but it was a lot more violent than his.
[01:27:53.641 --> 01:27:54.662]  I have a whole bunch of marks.
[01:27:54.722 --> 01:27:55.683]  I haven't gotten into that.
[01:27:55.703 --> 01:27:56.224]  You had a screw up?
[01:27:56.244 --> 01:27:57.265]  What happened to your arrest?
[01:27:57.325 --> 01:27:58.626]  I have a whole bunch of marks right here.
[01:27:58.927 --> 01:28:02.750]  So like I said, I was working the DJ booth because I actually got cool with a lot of them.
[01:28:02.811 --> 01:28:05.153]  One of the older guys offered me, he's like, hey, you want to come help me out with the sounds?
[01:28:05.193 --> 01:28:05.894]  I'm like, hell yeah, bro.
[01:28:05.914 --> 01:28:06.494]  That sounds cool.
[01:28:06.514 --> 01:28:06.995]  Trying to fit in.
[01:28:07.696 --> 01:28:11.941]  Um, anyways, I feel a security guard tap my shoulder, and he's like, hey, come with me, I need to escort you.
[01:28:11.961 --> 01:28:13.523]  Oh my gosh, shit, I know it's about to go down.
[01:28:13.883 --> 01:28:20.472]  So I start walking back, I start walking back, and then right when I get out, um, there's the camp, so right out, right when I get out of the camp, I just fucking dip.
[01:28:21.107 --> 01:28:24.930]  Um, well, little did I know, they already had a whole trap set up for me.
[01:28:24.970 --> 01:28:36.379]  There's a whole truck right there, a whole squad full of these, let's just say retired CrossFit guys that are like 50 years old, and they fucking jumped on me, and I kid you not, I kid you not, they're fucking shoving my face in the gravel.
[01:28:36.479 --> 01:28:38.300]  I have marks to prove it, we took pictures and everything.
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:39.301]  Yeah, show folks your elbows.
[01:28:39.341 --> 01:28:40.782]  Yeah, got that right there.
[01:28:40.802 --> 01:28:42.664]  I got all shit on my knees.
[01:28:43.304 --> 01:28:43.804]  I got everything.
[01:28:48.114 --> 01:28:49.114]  So what happened?
[01:28:49.114 --> 01:28:52.993]   Um, they, and after that, they were like, "Stop resisting, stop resisting, this is a
[01:28:52.993 --> 01:28:53.993]  citizen's arrest."
[01:28:53.993 --> 01:28:57.033]   You know, it's like every guy's dream to have a fucking citizen's arrest.
[01:28:57.033 --> 01:28:59.674]   So they were just so happy to get a citizen's arrest and basically damn near breaking my
[01:28:59.674 --> 01:29:02.793]   arm like, "Hey bro, y'all caught me, y'all caught me, I'm going, I'm going, it don't
[01:29:02.793 --> 01:29:03.793]  matter, don't matter."
[01:29:03.793 --> 01:29:06.034]  Then they threw me in the back of a fucking truck.
[01:29:06.034 --> 01:29:09.034]   And while I was in the truck, I'm in the middle, and let's say Andrew's one of them and Danny's
[01:29:09.309 --> 01:29:11.430]  They're both holding my thighs, acting like I'm gonna go anywhere.
[01:29:11.450 --> 01:29:12.350]  They're like, you're not going anywhere.
[01:29:12.370 --> 01:29:12.890]  You're not going anywhere.
[01:29:12.950 --> 01:29:13.350]  Why'd you do it?
[01:29:13.390 --> 01:29:13.810]  Why'd you do it?
[01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:15.151]  They're like, you fucking pushed me.
[01:29:15.171 --> 01:29:16.071]  I'm like, bro, I didn't push you.
[01:29:16.091 --> 01:29:17.011]  I'm like, stop making up things.
[01:29:17.031 --> 01:29:18.832]  You tried to expose a Republican gay orgy.
[01:29:18.872 --> 01:29:22.733]  Yeah, we're trying to expose the people, and we're trying to expose these people, and that's another thing.
[01:29:22.753 --> 01:29:24.073]  Republicans are like sucking dick in here.
[01:29:24.093 --> 01:29:24.573]  What are you doing?
[01:29:24.593 --> 01:29:28.990]   For sure, and the more important thing, it's like, We're journalists at the end of the day, guys.
[01:29:29.250 --> 01:29:33.654]  This is our right to expose all the injustices that are going on behind the scenes so you guys can see that.
[01:29:33.954 --> 01:29:39.078]  So for us, for them to treat us extremely just like actual animals, it felt like I robbed a fucking bank.
[01:29:39.658 --> 01:29:40.259]  And it was ridiculous.
[01:29:40.279 --> 01:29:41.459]  Well, that's official oppression.
[01:29:41.479 --> 01:29:42.380]  So you get a lawyer.
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:45.082]  They've charged you with a felony.
[01:29:45.422 --> 01:29:51.147]  The minute you sue them for official oppression and kidnapping, they will drop charges and pay you $100,000.
[01:29:51.187 --> 01:29:51.487]  Yeah.
[01:29:52.368 --> 01:29:54.109]  You sue them for official oppression.
[01:29:56.278 --> 01:29:57.779]  And they're going to drop all charges.
[01:29:57.979 --> 01:29:58.720]  Official oppression?
[01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:00.761]  Official oppression and kidnapping.
[01:30:01.042 --> 01:30:01.302]  Okay.
[01:30:01.642 --> 01:30:05.905]  Bohemian Grove kidnapped citizen journalist exposing globalists.
[01:30:06.205 --> 01:30:07.466]  Yeah, and it wasn't that.
[01:30:07.506 --> 01:30:08.247]  That wasn't started.
[01:30:08.267 --> 01:30:11.970]  Then they had me outside their fucking working thing for an hour just questioning me.
[01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:13.391]  They ended up... Oh, they're watching right now.
[01:30:13.411 --> 01:30:14.612]  What do you want to say to them?
[01:30:14.712 --> 01:30:18.194]  You just officially oppressed with your gay sex cult.
[01:30:18.274 --> 01:30:22.180]   You just got caught Your gay sex cult suppressing journalists.
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:31.045]  What I gotta say to you, what I gotta say to you is have fun charging everyone because next year the boys are coming back we're bringing in a hundred people so if you're gonna charge everyone you're gonna have to charge everyone and that's gonna be a big budget for you.
[01:30:31.085 --> 01:30:31.705]  You want to speak?
[01:30:31.946 --> 01:30:32.686]  You infiltrated.
[01:30:33.026 --> 01:30:36.608]  Also next time I think uh... Wait, wait, we gotta put the mic on you.
[01:30:38.189 --> 01:30:41.551]  Everybody here just played a vital role and I just want to thank everybody here.
[01:30:41.571 --> 01:30:42.732]  You guys did amazing.
[01:30:44.073 --> 01:30:45.654]  And yeah we exposed this evil cult.
[01:30:46.855 --> 01:30:47.255]  That's that.
[01:30:48.177 --> 01:30:50.298]  But I want to be clear, I'm not just saying this, Tack.
[01:30:50.859 --> 01:30:52.540]  They officially oppressed you.
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:31:00.064]  Bohemian Grove security kidnapped journalists and tortured them with the zip ties.
[01:31:01.625 --> 01:31:03.826]  I mean, you've, oh my God, you've got to sue them.
[01:31:03.866 --> 01:31:04.926]  You've got to sue Bohemian Grove.
[01:31:05.407 --> 01:31:07.868]  They're going to be, oh, they're going to be, they'll drop your chart.
[01:31:08.248 --> 01:31:09.429]  Felony charges, folks.
[01:31:09.449 --> 01:31:12.291]  I'm proud to show you a bunch of Republicans sucking each other's dicks.
[01:31:12.871 --> 01:31:16.253]  Also, next time you should just citizens arrest them before they citizens arrest you.
[01:31:17.308 --> 01:31:18.889]  And so we pull out, yes, a reversal.
[01:31:18.949 --> 01:31:22.092]  That's why I didn't, I don't know, I didn't guard their ass.
[01:31:22.272 --> 01:31:26.155]  Also, big shout-out to Dancer for getting that footage that you just, guys, saw.
[01:31:26.235 --> 01:31:28.997]  Like, I was arrested... Well, like, where do they think this goes?
[01:31:29.037 --> 01:31:33.200]  Imagine they, like, tackle somebody who doesn't... I'm not putting you down, you did the right thing.
[01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:34.901]  I don't do too well.
[01:31:35.321 --> 01:31:38.104]  So, imagine you tackle the wrong person, now you're in a war.
[01:31:39.525 --> 01:31:41.586]  You guys want to suck each other's dicks all day, that's fine.
[01:31:41.606 --> 01:31:42.607]  We're not mad that you're gay, okay?
[01:31:43.464 --> 01:31:45.945]  You're Republicans, you wanna go have gay sex, we understand that.
[01:31:45.965 --> 01:31:47.166]  It's okay, you're not bad.
[01:31:47.906 --> 01:31:49.547]  I like women, you like men, it's okay, we're not mad at you.
[01:31:50.108 --> 01:31:55.148]   But you're not gonna sit there now and persecute people just because you want to suck dick all day.
[01:31:55.148 --> 01:31:58.347]  I'm sorry, that was...
[01:31:58.347 --> 01:31:59.347]  [laughter]
[01:31:59.347 --> 01:32:00.347]  That was really funny.
[01:32:00.347 --> 01:32:01.347]  Oh, true.
[01:32:01.347 --> 01:32:03.787]  Let me tell you right now, it's like, hold on.
[01:32:03.787 --> 01:32:07.947]  Oh, by the way, they sent me a threat on my work email.
[01:32:07.976 --> 01:32:18.265]   So basically, when I got the job super last minute and even though I didn't show up to work, I didn't show up to work Um, they did not send me my work schedule.
[01:32:18.385 --> 01:32:22.387]  So, they were, they fired me, but I didn't get any work schedule when I'm working.
[01:32:22.427 --> 01:32:27.870]  This is how unorganized, like... You know, you thought your job was just disposing a bunch of homosexual Republicans.
[01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:32.253]  Yes, but... They're like, look, I'm just trying to show you guys having gay sex rituals.
[01:32:32.293 --> 01:32:32.873]  What's the big deal?
[01:32:32.913 --> 01:32:38.056]  But I sent them a very professional email, and all they replied, this is, they replied at like two o'clock in the morning.
[01:32:38.436 --> 01:32:42.246]   They basically said, like, All lies, amateur hour.
[01:32:42.666 --> 01:32:44.166]  I kind of took it as a threat.
[01:32:44.186 --> 01:32:45.367]  Oh yeah, it's amateur hour.
[01:32:45.427 --> 01:32:46.267]  It's 20 people in 2014.
[01:32:46.627 --> 01:32:48.528]  I bet it's 100 next year.
[01:32:48.868 --> 01:32:49.108]  Yeah.
[01:32:49.608 --> 01:32:49.848]  Yeah.
[01:32:50.989 --> 01:32:58.351]  I mean, basically this guy has the craziest ideas and you'll hear it from him and we're going to pull it off.
[01:32:58.371 --> 01:33:00.412]  By the way, I only met you guys a week ago on the phone.
[01:33:00.832 --> 01:33:02.733]  What was the impetus to do this?
[01:33:02.773 --> 01:33:03.213]  What happened?
[01:33:03.817 --> 01:33:04.718]  Oh, you got this one, dude.
[01:33:05.158 --> 01:33:05.859]  Oh, shoot.
[01:33:05.959 --> 01:33:07.720]  So we're trying to find Banksy right now.
[01:33:08.421 --> 01:33:11.403]  It's like an ongoing plot, and it's a long story.
[01:33:11.503 --> 01:33:12.404]  I don't know.
[01:33:13.345 --> 01:33:20.690]  It's a long story, but we started sneaking into places and trying to, like, expose corruption and stuff, and, like, we snuck into Scientology.
[01:33:20.730 --> 01:33:21.851]  We snuck into McKamey Manor.
[01:33:21.871 --> 01:33:23.693]  We snuck into the 12 Tribes cult.
[01:33:23.753 --> 01:33:24.693]  We infiltrate cults.
[01:33:24.753 --> 01:33:27.936]  We try and take things that are bad in the world.
[01:33:28.096 --> 01:33:29.457]  You just snuck into InfoWars.
[01:33:29.477 --> 01:33:29.617]  Yeah.
[01:33:29.657 --> 01:33:30.418]  What'd you find?
[01:33:30.698 --> 01:33:31.339]  What'd you find?
[01:33:31.419 --> 01:33:32.540]  Ain't nothing to hide, brother.
[01:33:33.340 --> 01:33:34.281]  It's all out there.
[01:33:34.481 --> 01:33:37.642]  We just wanted to see what actually goes on there, like the truth.
[01:33:37.802 --> 01:33:42.124]  Is everything that we've, that people have heard before, is that actually true?
[01:33:42.144 --> 01:33:44.045]  Moving on, how do you see him forward?
[01:33:44.085 --> 01:33:44.626]  What do you think of it?
[01:33:44.906 --> 01:33:49.308]  Oh, I think, I think you're one of the most entertaining people I've ever met in my entire life.
[01:33:50.343 --> 01:33:53.905]  Uh, I don't know how you have the energy to be this energetic.
[01:33:54.385 --> 01:33:59.107]  I can be this energetic for like one hour, but you're like this, like, the entire day we've met you so far today.
[01:33:59.347 --> 01:34:00.167]  I call you the GOAT.
[01:34:00.187 --> 01:34:01.568]  Like, you're so good at what you do.
[01:34:01.648 --> 01:34:03.689]  Not about, I'm just saying, you see us.
[01:34:04.349 --> 01:34:05.750]  What you get on air is the thing.
[01:34:06.110 --> 01:34:10.512]  This is, there's no, because I don't, I spend zero brain power on fake news.
[01:34:10.732 --> 01:34:11.592]  Just like YouTube.
[01:34:11.612 --> 01:34:15.093]  YouTube will censor stuff, and this is just the realest, so.
[01:34:15.494 --> 01:34:17.695]  I appreciate actually being on here, so thank you.
[01:34:17.815 --> 01:34:20.439]   But guys, You've been charged with felonies.
[01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:22.160]  You are journalists.
[01:34:22.180 --> 01:34:22.961]  You are heroes.
[01:34:23.582 --> 01:34:24.943]  They officially oppressed you.
[01:34:24.963 --> 01:34:26.844]  They tortured you.
[01:34:26.864 --> 01:34:28.946]  They're gonna owe you money.
[01:34:29.487 --> 01:34:30.647]  So flip the script.
[01:34:30.948 --> 01:34:31.148]  Okay.
[01:34:31.855 --> 01:34:34.417]  I definitely will for the script, and I just want to thank you for having us.
[01:34:34.517 --> 01:34:38.739]  It was just a crazy experience to be a part of, and I'm glad I was able to bring you guys the footage.
[01:34:38.779 --> 01:34:41.321]  A lot of it's going to be released, so make sure to check it out on their channel.
[01:34:41.361 --> 01:34:42.882]  Yeah, we have no plan.
[01:34:43.322 --> 01:34:45.203]  We want to get as much out as you can.
[01:34:45.223 --> 01:34:48.966]  You guys put a film out, I'll promote you, but you got a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff too.
[01:34:49.026 --> 01:34:50.927]  Oh yeah, we got a crap ton of behind-the-scenes.
[01:34:51.127 --> 01:35:00.069]  Oh, we have so much stuff that it's actually going to take so long to edit, but this might be the craziest video we've ever posted, maybe on the internet.
[01:35:00.089 --> 01:35:05.910]  I want to be clear, I'm not saying it's not occultic, it is, but that's a small sliver of the compromising.
[01:35:05.970 --> 01:35:08.990]  It's the gay sex and the prostitutes that are in town.
[01:35:09.450 --> 01:35:11.451]  That's my point, is this is a lot bigger.
[01:35:13.211 --> 01:35:13.911]  This is big.
[01:35:14.491 --> 01:35:18.421]   Yeah, I feel bad that I'm like, I didn't get hit on because I don't know.
[01:35:18.441 --> 01:35:21.902]  I feel like if I go to a gay bar, I definitely get hit on all the time.
[01:35:22.343 --> 01:35:28.265]  I actually thought it would have been hilarious if I got hit on.
[01:35:29.385 --> 01:35:34.527]  I just was curious because I wanted to see how far they would have took it.
[01:35:34.727 --> 01:35:35.908]  Well I was trying to act cool.
[01:35:37.605 --> 01:35:38.945]  24 years ago, I was a lot better looking.
[01:35:39.446 --> 01:35:42.066]  I was pinched on the ass, mobbed when I was there.
[01:35:42.546 --> 01:35:46.747]  The closest thing I got to flirting, like I said, I got offered to stay at a campsite.
[01:35:46.867 --> 01:35:48.988]  And right when I kind of, again, like, nah, I don't really want it.
[01:35:49.028 --> 01:35:52.669]  That's when they kind of started being suspicious about me.
[01:35:53.229 --> 01:35:54.329]  That's kind of when I got turned in.
[01:35:54.349 --> 01:35:55.670]  That's when kind of my cover was blown.
[01:35:56.590 --> 01:35:58.909]   I was like kind of hesitant to spend the night at their camp.
[01:35:58.909 --> 01:36:00.110]  And they call it sleeping around.
[01:36:00.110 --> 01:36:02.590]  Yeah, they call it sleeping around verbatim guys.
[01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:03.389]  I'm not lying here.
[01:36:03.389 --> 01:36:06.750]   You can if you sneak in a bohemian groom next year, try to sleep around.
[01:36:06.750 --> 01:36:10.429]   I mean, like it's just it's just it's just really cringy to be honest.
[01:36:10.429 --> 01:36:14.670]   Like all these old rich guys going into the forest, you know,
[01:36:14.670 --> 01:36:15.949]  fucking jacking each other off.
[01:36:15.949 --> 01:36:18.429]   And it's just well, they obviously tell them don't mess with the employees.
[01:36:18.617 --> 01:36:20.299]  But if they can get you, they will.
[01:36:20.339 --> 01:36:26.864]  But me, when I went in 25 years, 24 years ago, it was pinch on the ass, Pepe Le Pew, it was on.
[01:36:27.905 --> 01:36:28.305]  Dang.
[01:36:28.625 --> 01:36:32.909]  Yeah, I didn't get... I wish I got pinched in the butt, that'd be cool.
[01:36:32.929 --> 01:36:33.829]  That'd be a cool story.
[01:36:33.849 --> 01:36:37.873]  I mean, it happened.
[01:36:37.913 --> 01:36:38.393]  This happened.
[01:36:39.048 --> 01:36:39.408]  Dang.
[01:36:39.609 --> 01:36:41.550]  But yeah, I say let's get a hundred people in next year.
[01:36:41.570 --> 01:36:42.951]  That sounds like a sick goal.
[01:36:43.192 --> 01:36:46.174]  I feel like out of the, what do you have, uh, you said millions of people watching.
[01:36:46.194 --> 01:36:50.258]  If 1% of them sign up to go in next year, that's like a hundred thousand people.
[01:36:50.578 --> 01:36:53.961]  Well, that's the point is that their intimidation is not working.
[01:36:54.882 --> 01:36:55.322]  I don't know.
[01:36:55.543 --> 01:36:58.905]  I know they had that, uh, History Channel thing trying to set me up.
[01:36:58.925 --> 01:37:00.527]  They didn't get me arrested.
[01:37:00.567 --> 01:37:01.768]  They had a fake arrest for themselves.
[01:37:02.369 --> 01:37:03.129]  This is epic.
[01:37:03.189 --> 01:37:03.910]  This is epic stuff.
[01:37:04.423 --> 01:37:07.665]  So yeah, you were saying the history, because I watched the History Channel.
[01:37:07.805 --> 01:37:13.149]  The first time I tried infiltrating it, it was literally just to make fun of the History Channel because that was like the worst thing ever.
[01:37:13.909 --> 01:37:20.514]  But you're saying that they actually set you up because they were, they got fake arrested and tried to get you real arrested.
[01:37:20.534 --> 01:37:20.514]  100%.
[01:37:20.554 --> 01:37:22.055]  That's my belief.
[01:37:22.715 --> 01:37:22.915]  Wow.
[01:37:25.074 --> 01:37:25.775]  I kind of believe it.
[01:37:25.795 --> 01:37:26.296]  I don't know.
[01:37:26.416 --> 01:37:28.099]  I'm like 50-50 on the fence on that one.
[01:37:28.239 --> 01:37:29.922]  No, I believe it because I watched that video.
[01:37:29.962 --> 01:37:32.365]  I thought it was one of the dumbest videos I've ever seen.
[01:37:32.405 --> 01:37:34.489]  I was like, dude, of course you're going to like.
[01:37:34.749 --> 01:37:35.951]  They're like, stop right there.
[01:37:35.971 --> 01:37:38.675]  And I go, F you and jump on the back.
[01:37:38.815 --> 01:37:40.218]  There's one security guard.
[01:37:40.858 --> 01:37:50.704]  There's one security, there's a mile-long, it's called River Road, there's a mile-long of camps and you can sneak in literally anywhere in that mile-long distance except for one spot.
[01:37:50.724 --> 01:37:53.405]  There's one spot you can't sneak in, they put one security guard there.
[01:37:53.706 --> 01:37:58.448]  And that's exactly, they went to the one spot you can't sneak in.
[01:37:58.889 --> 01:38:02.231]  Which is like pretty suspicious to the History Channel, I will say that for sure.
[01:38:03.171 --> 01:38:05.292]  Well regardless, Trump just got shot in the face.
[01:38:05.973 --> 01:38:06.753]  They're gonna go for Brooke.
[01:38:06.773 --> 01:38:07.554]  What do you think about Trump?
[01:38:11.135 --> 01:38:16.741]  I mean, I think no matter what political side you're on, it's really sad that someone has to die.
[01:38:16.761 --> 01:38:18.903]  I think the end of a life is always bad.
[01:38:18.923 --> 01:38:24.389]  I have no opinions on that thing.
[01:38:24.409 --> 01:38:25.970]  I don't know.
[01:38:26.031 --> 01:38:27.252]  Yeah, it's just...
[01:38:28.098 --> 01:38:36.985]  It's just no matter the state of America, you can just tell it's in total decline when the citizens are going to the lengths to not to let someone get elected and it's murder.
[01:38:37.005 --> 01:38:49.275]   They're trying to murder a guy not to get elected and for just America to go that far off the deep end, of course presidents have been assassinated, of course, but it's not too fucking often and it's just sad that We're living through history.
[01:38:49.335 --> 01:38:53.978]  Yeah, we definitely are living through history, and I think maybe Behemoth Grove, like you said, might be behind some of it, you know?
[01:38:54.018 --> 01:38:58.962]  Like, there's hundreds of camps, there's hundreds, there's three thousands of people there, there's no way I could have went to every camp.
[01:38:59.202 --> 01:39:05.326]  And there's probably some camps, guys, that are some suspicious shit is going on, because these are the riches of richness, and they know what the fuck they're having.
[01:39:05.346 --> 01:39:06.567]  But you said they hate Trump.
[01:39:06.907 --> 01:39:12.791]  Yeah, I mean... So, one of you this morning told me, I forget who it was, they were like, oh, they were upset Trump didn't die.
[01:39:12.811 --> 01:39:13.332]  Who told me that?
[01:39:14.171 --> 01:39:15.272]  I don't know.
[01:39:15.312 --> 01:39:16.354]  Was that you maybe?
[01:39:16.374 --> 01:39:16.874]  I don't know.
[01:39:16.954 --> 01:39:20.478]  I said they were like just super caught off guard like they were in shock about it.
[01:39:20.498 --> 01:39:21.058]  Start over.
[01:39:21.338 --> 01:39:22.279]  You have the mic.
[01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:22.720]  Start over.
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:24.822]  So I really didn't hear too much.
[01:39:24.922 --> 01:39:42.238]   I just kind of heard a few conversations in passing as I was walking by some guys but they were just talking about like oh oh my god like did you guys see that he got shot like I couldn't really tell what side they were on if they were glad that he got shot or if they were Um, upset, but I just think they were just shocked by it in general.
[01:39:42.318 --> 01:39:47.181]  But another thing I was going to say is I think that the whole him getting shot in the, he got shot in the ear, right?
[01:39:47.261 --> 01:39:47.441]  Yeah.
[01:39:47.541 --> 01:39:48.281]  I haven't even seen the picture.
[01:39:48.301 --> 01:39:52.544]  I just, I've been in jail for the past 24 hours, but, um, what's the code?
[01:39:52.664 --> 01:39:56.886]  I think that, I mean, not to be a conspiracy theorist, but I feel like it could be like a fake.
[01:39:57.006 --> 01:40:02.029]  I feel like this could be something to just push some sort of agenda that, oh, they're out to get him.
[01:40:02.089 --> 01:40:04.550]  And this is, I've said this before.
[01:40:05.552 --> 01:40:09.674]  You go to like a store that sells furniture and there's a bowl of fake fruit a hundred yards away.
[01:40:09.694 --> 01:40:10.294]  Right.
[01:40:10.334 --> 01:40:11.355]  You know it's a fake bowl.
[01:40:11.415 --> 01:40:12.135]  No, this is real.
[01:40:12.475 --> 01:40:13.916]  Like he, boom, he gets hit in the ear.
[01:40:13.936 --> 01:40:14.916]  It's just real.
[01:40:15.116 --> 01:40:16.297]  Oh, you think it's like a hundred percent real?
[01:40:16.317 --> 01:40:16.857]  Oh, it's real.
[01:40:16.917 --> 01:40:17.657]  No, okay.
[01:40:18.017 --> 01:40:20.378]  It's as real as your mama.
[01:40:21.779 --> 01:40:24.000]  What are the chances that he's this far off?
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:33.284]  Like, it's crazy how like if he was this far to the right, like we would be living in a completely different world right now.
[01:40:34.187 --> 01:40:38.628]  So, that's a great question.
[01:40:38.648 --> 01:40:39.889]  What would have happened if they killed Trump?
[01:40:40.309 --> 01:40:41.409]  Yeah, that's what I say.
[01:40:41.809 --> 01:40:50.592]  If he was one degree to the right, like one degree distance, we would be living in like, it's like the butterfly effect, but like times a million, you know?
[01:40:51.132 --> 01:40:54.613]  Like it would be such a huge difference in what we're experiencing now.
[01:40:54.633 --> 01:40:54.873]  Absolutely.
[01:40:55.153 --> 01:40:56.293]  You guys are incredible.
[01:40:56.793 --> 01:40:58.074]  You're citizen journalists.
[01:40:58.234 --> 01:40:59.374]  You've been charged with felonies.
[01:40:59.394 --> 01:41:00.154]  You've done nothing wrong.
[01:41:00.174 --> 01:41:00.694]  You're heroes.
[01:41:00.734 --> 01:41:01.735]  Like, join Assange.
[01:41:02.195 --> 01:41:02.855]  First Amendment.
[01:41:03.504 --> 01:41:04.245]  They will fail.
[01:41:04.265 --> 01:41:07.287]  You need to countersue them for official oppression.
[01:41:07.307 --> 01:41:09.008]  They will back off like that.
[01:41:09.629 --> 01:41:12.031]  Closing comments right now for everybody watching.
[01:41:12.751 --> 01:41:13.452]  I'll just say this.
[01:41:13.952 --> 01:41:16.134]  Scientology tried suing me for like a million dollars.
[01:41:16.314 --> 01:41:18.496]  CBS has tried suing me for like five million dollars.
[01:41:18.916 --> 01:41:20.597]  The Flat Earth community tried suing me.
[01:41:20.617 --> 01:41:24.740]  I get sued every documentary I make and it's never been successful.
[01:41:24.981 --> 01:41:27.482]  So I guess good luck, Bohemian Grove.
[01:41:28.323 --> 01:41:31.085]  When working with Reckless Ben, I just it never fails.
[01:41:31.165 --> 01:41:32.266]  So sue us.
[01:41:32.646 --> 01:41:33.227]  You ain't winning.
[01:41:34.747 --> 01:41:38.770]  Yeah, I mean, just super glad that Alex had us on, so thank you, but screw Bohemia Grove.
[01:41:39.130 --> 01:41:40.210]  I'm probably not going back.
[01:41:40.451 --> 01:41:45.013]  I got the scoop for y'all, though, so I hope y'all enjoy the footage when it's released, and you guys are going to learn a lot.
[01:41:45.033 --> 01:41:46.194]  A lot of questions are going to be answered.
[01:41:46.214 --> 01:41:48.436]  There's a lot of misinformation going on about Bohemia Grove.
[01:41:48.456 --> 01:41:49.276]  So many YouTube videos.
[01:41:49.336 --> 01:41:50.817]  I would tell you guys just dump it all.
[01:41:50.997 --> 01:41:51.537]  Put it all out.
[01:41:51.618 --> 01:41:52.578]  Yeah, so thank you guys.
[01:41:52.618 --> 01:41:54.940]  I'm just glad I got to experience it.
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:05.008]   Like I said, I don't want to say too much until my case is closed, but Y'all will see it in the documentary after the case is over and yeah, I think that it's gonna be crazy.
[01:42:05.028 --> 01:42:07.929]  He's got more clips we're about to put on Real Alex Jones.
[01:42:08.949 --> 01:42:11.330]  I didn't do anything wrong so y'all can't arrest me.
[01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:15.051]  I'm just here documenting on VR.
[01:42:15.191 --> 01:42:24.874]  We have a lot of editing to get this done but we're just gonna make sure we get it out for you guys and it's gonna be one of the craziest videos you'll ever watch and thank you so much Alex for having us on.
[01:42:25.254 --> 01:42:25.654]  Thank you.
[01:42:25.734 --> 01:42:27.255]  Well, they just tried to kill Trump.
[01:42:28.263 --> 01:42:29.564]  We're still on air right now.
[01:42:30.045 --> 01:42:31.306]  Thanks to Elon Musk and others.
[01:42:31.766 --> 01:42:32.787]  We're gonna fight hard.
[01:42:32.867 --> 01:42:33.748]  We need your prayers.
[01:42:34.108 --> 01:42:36.991]  Will you take this video and boost it everywhere?
[01:42:37.051 --> 01:42:39.853]  Because the globalists are on their heels.
[01:42:39.993 --> 01:42:41.334]  We are marching forward.
[01:42:41.715 --> 01:42:42.816]  We're not playing games.
[01:42:42.976 --> 01:42:44.256]  And we're coming for him.
[01:42:44.256 --> 01:42:47.476]  All right.
[01:42:47.476 --> 01:42:50.815]  Yeah, I need a plug.

[01:45:05.796 --> 01:45:17.906]  Yeah!
[01:45:19.627 --> 01:45:24.771]  This is a make it or break it moment so I need people to connect those synapses in their brain for you to make a decision.
[01:45:25.931 --> 01:45:29.033]  If you don't support InfoWars, we will be shut down.
[01:45:29.053 --> 01:45:31.875]  And people say, well, they're constantly trying to shut you down.
[01:45:31.915 --> 01:45:32.655]  How are you still on the air?
[01:45:32.816 --> 01:45:33.096]  God.
[01:45:34.116 --> 01:45:35.197]  But God works through people.
[01:45:36.718 --> 01:45:42.021]  So, we're in a paradox here, where the judge says we're open for three more months.
[01:45:43.723 --> 01:45:48.185]  If we're able to get a buyer out of the law, they won't be able to shut us down.
[01:45:48.206 --> 01:45:49.126]  I'll just work with somebody else.
[01:45:50.047 --> 01:45:51.267]  And that's coming, that's got to be set up.
[01:45:52.448 --> 01:46:01.613]   But in the meantime, If people believe the news that we're being shut down everywhere, which they tried to do and failed, by that foregone conclusion we're shut down.
[01:46:01.753 --> 01:46:13.075]  And under the last federal bankruptcy manager who would not reorder product and killed all our advertising, who was positioning us to be shut down and tried to shut us down, we caught him.
[01:46:13.335 --> 01:46:14.375]  The judge caught him and fired him.
[01:46:15.876 --> 01:46:17.336]  We're almost sold out of all the products.
[01:46:18.174 --> 01:46:18.414]  All right?
[01:46:19.215 --> 01:46:21.957]  But we have a lot of great products that are still in stock.
[01:46:22.457 --> 01:46:23.198]  Limited supplies.
[01:46:23.238 --> 01:46:26.500]  So I need you to go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:46:26.740 --> 01:46:27.781]  And we just had a donation button.
[01:46:27.801 --> 01:46:28.582]  Maybe we should just do that.
[01:46:29.302 --> 01:46:32.064]  You're fighting for freedom in a key election, battling the globalists.
[01:46:32.084 --> 01:46:32.745]  We need support.
[01:46:33.465 --> 01:46:35.046]  But we want a long-term relationship with you.
