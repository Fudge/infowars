[00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:14.814]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:15.975 --> 00:00:18.016]  It's Sunday night, February 4th, 2024.
[00:00:18.096 --> 00:00:24.020]  I'm your embattled and emboldened host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:38.710]  We are 274 days, 7 hours, 59 minutes, 32 seconds out.
[00:00:39.471 --> 00:00:42.372]  The most important election in world history.
[00:00:44.712 --> 00:00:47.093]  All right, I've got some really good news tonight.
[00:00:47.193 --> 00:00:49.334]  Some very positive things that are happening around the world.
[00:00:49.354 --> 00:00:53.455]  A lot of examples of it that I want to hit early in the first hour.
[00:00:54.534 --> 00:00:54.994]  We're good to go.
[00:00:55.014 --> 00:00:55.175]  I think?
[00:01:12.315 --> 00:01:12.715]  We're good to go.
[00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:45.308]  Now, the Democrat cities have already passed laws to have them vote in local elections, which are held on the same ballot as the federal and state elections.
[00:01:45.368 --> 00:01:53.251]  So we know this has been going on for decades and getting worse and worse, and they're giving out driver's licenses in over 20 states to illegal aliens so they can vote.
[00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:56.271]  But now it's out in the open.
[00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:59.813]  And that's just two of the articles that I have here in this huge stack.
[00:02:00.293 --> 00:02:04.154]  I have a whole stack of articles from New York to Oregon.
[00:02:05.472 --> 00:02:06.252]  We're good to go.
[00:02:06.552 --> 00:02:07.173]  We're good to go.
[00:02:33.612 --> 00:02:34.853]  This isn't news conferences.
[00:02:34.873 --> 00:02:35.574]  This is admitted.
[00:02:35.594 --> 00:02:37.535]  This is happening all over.
[00:02:37.555 --> 00:02:39.737]  You saw this happen years ago in Europe for the illegal aliens.
[00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:46.023]  In his program to get housing assistance, it just goes through the state.
[00:02:49.185 --> 00:02:56.051]  And so nobody gets an extra cut, but when the illegal aliens are being handled by the NGOs, they get a big slice of it.
[00:02:57.873 --> 00:03:01.336]  So there's massive layers of welfare fraud here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:07.203]  And welfare is always dangerous because it domesticates people and it grows the size of the state.
[00:03:07.243 --> 00:03:22.768]  But if we're going to have it, should it be 93-year-old war heroes or should it be illegal aliens that are beating up police and then getting out with no bail, no bond, and flipping off the news cameras?
[00:03:23.688 --> 00:03:27.930]  So this stack is absolutely critical today, and we're going to be hitting that.
[00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:30.415]  We'll hit that first when we come back.
[00:03:30.975 --> 00:03:41.038]  Then we got huge election news, even in mainline Democrat-skewed polls, where they canvassed 15% more Democrats.
[00:03:41.078 --> 00:03:43.979]  They baked that in that Democrats are the dominant party, though they're not.
[00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:44.900]  They're the dying party.
[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.900]  Despite that, Trump has 20-point lead.
[00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:50.521]  And in battleground states, 5 to 10 points.
[00:03:50.581 --> 00:03:53.182]  I mean, this is full panic mode.
[00:03:55.162 --> 00:03:56.283]  Got a whole bunch of these polls.
[00:03:57.307 --> 00:04:00.628]  I didn't realize it was such big news when I talked to him weeks ago and he told me he was going over there.
[00:04:00.668 --> 00:04:08.649]  But I didn't say anything about it on air because I know it was an interesting little fact-finding mission he's on.
[00:04:23.334 --> 00:04:29.878]  He's not doing any interviews while he's over there, but I'm not going to give any secrets out, but I will give you a little bit of what I can tell you about.
[00:04:30.878 --> 00:04:33.420]  People are certainly wanting to know about that, so I talked to him today.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.963]  I can fill you in a little bit on stuff that's not secret but not known yet.
[00:04:39.255 --> 00:04:48.439]  And also we've got just huge news on the China situation, Ukraine situation, and so much more today.
[00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:49.400]  Please stay with us.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.801]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[00:04:52.821 --> 00:04:57.984]  We're going to have a good broadcast today because, well, I'll explain when we come back why.
[00:05:02.062 --> 00:05:02.182]  So...
[00:05:25.282 --> 00:05:33.523]  Well, I'm glad you mentioned that because it's methylfolate, the breakdown of folic acid, and a lot of people, particularly Europeans, don't absorb all of the folic acid.
[00:05:33.764 --> 00:05:34.864]  So it's not a stimulant.
[00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:38.504]  It's a totally natural thing that boosts energy that's foundational.
[00:05:38.784 --> 00:05:41.345]  And was I lying to you or did it not work?
[00:05:42.025 --> 00:05:43.225]  No, it was top-notch.
[00:05:43.285 --> 00:05:46.906]  And I was actually taking Red Pill Plus before, and that's got a little folic acid in it.
[00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:50.747]  I think there was a little buildup from this, but the energy from this was no jitters.
[00:05:50.907 --> 00:05:51.847]  I mean, it's top-notch.
[00:05:51.927 --> 00:05:52.647]  It's a great product.
[00:05:53.066 --> 00:05:54.047]  Well, thank you so much.
[00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:57.829]  Yeah, no, folic acid's great and is in real red pill, but some can't break it down.
[00:05:57.869 --> 00:05:58.890]  This is the breakdown of it.
[00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:59.731]  That's exactly it.
[00:06:04.714 --> 00:06:15.442]  You are listening to an Infowars.com front-line report.
[00:06:16.402 --> 00:06:20.225]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistant.
[00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:24.970]  It's Sunday, February 4th, 2024.
[00:06:26.191 --> 00:06:32.312]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:06:32.332 --> 00:06:35.093]  Very thankful for all of you tuning in here today.
[00:06:35.113 --> 00:06:40.014]  We have a lot of huge news we're going to be tackling tonight.
[00:06:40.054 --> 00:06:41.614]  We have some really, really good news.
[00:06:42.294 --> 00:06:43.615]  A whole stack of good news.
[00:06:44.235 --> 00:06:50.977]  That if we embrace this good news and how this good news has come to us, we will defeat their entire New World Order.
[00:06:51.377 --> 00:06:52.377]  And it's very simple.
[00:06:53.342 --> 00:06:54.263]  We're good to go.
[00:06:54.303 --> 00:06:54.963]  We're good to go.
[00:07:19.278 --> 00:07:19.898]  We're good to go.
[00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:20.198]  I think?
[00:07:40.145 --> 00:07:40.966]  We're good to go.
[00:07:41.006 --> 00:07:41.206]  I think?
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:03.941]  We're good to go.
[00:08:20.251 --> 00:08:21.191]  We're good to go.
[00:08:46.186 --> 00:08:46.806]  We're good to go.
[00:08:46.906 --> 00:08:47.646]  We're good to go.
[00:09:08.669 --> 00:09:11.350]  But now, it's out in the open.
[00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.791]  And this is so criminal, there's no way it survives.
[00:09:13.851 --> 00:09:16.272]  I don't even care how corrupt the Justice Department is.
[00:09:17.632 --> 00:09:20.593]  Even their own federal judges, and I've met with some of them, are pissed.
[00:09:21.213 --> 00:09:23.834]  Because they tell them, hey, we've got a five-time convicted pedophile here.
[00:09:24.434 --> 00:09:24.854]  Let him go.
[00:09:26.415 --> 00:09:27.575]  Well, wait, we've got to charge him.
[00:09:27.615 --> 00:09:28.115]  No, let him go.
[00:09:29.396 --> 00:09:30.996]  And Elon Musk is talking about it.
[00:09:31.717 --> 00:09:32.677]  It's all over the news now.
[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:34.481]  We're good to go.
[00:09:51.527 --> 00:09:52.568]  You're like, okay, we already know that.
[00:09:53.268 --> 00:09:55.070]  Yeah, because you're the tip of the spear, folks.
[00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:56.631]  You can say, oh, go kiss our ass.
[00:09:56.651 --> 00:09:57.932]  I mean, it's true.
[00:09:58.333 --> 00:09:59.133]  They don't fear me.
[00:09:59.714 --> 00:10:01.736]  They fear this big audience educating others.
[00:10:01.776 --> 00:10:05.599]  So we've hit the point of escape velocity.
[00:10:06.769 --> 00:10:08.870]  So we've got that stack and a bunch of other big news.
[00:10:09.391 --> 00:10:11.472]  Trump, 20-point lead in major polls.
[00:10:12.512 --> 00:10:14.133]  And these are skewed, manipulated polls.
[00:10:15.254 --> 00:10:20.297]  In the methodology, they have a lot of manipulations, but the big ones, they had 10, 15 to 20 points.
[00:10:20.337 --> 00:10:21.637]  Here's the 15, this newest one, it's 15.
[00:10:21.978 --> 00:10:22.938]  I looked up the methodology.
[00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.899]  It took me 30 minutes to find it today.
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.421]  They had 15% more Democrats to it.
[00:10:27.441 --> 00:10:27.921]  That's standard.
[00:10:28.521 --> 00:10:30.763]  As if it's the dominant party, it's the majority party, which it's not.
[00:10:31.861 --> 00:10:36.263]  It's become a secondary party and it's about to become a vestigial, ceremonial party, probably a dead party.
[00:10:36.943 --> 00:10:40.084]  It's been 200 plus years, it's time for it to go bye-bye and for a new party to rise up.
[00:10:40.785 --> 00:10:47.087]  I'm not for a three-four party system, I'm not for a parliament system, but we don't have a two-party system.
[00:10:47.127 --> 00:10:52.670]  We have a neocon, leftist, uniparty, waging war against the populist Trump party.
[00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:54.690]  You'd say, well, I don't like Trump.
[00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:58.232]  Well, regardless, they see him as representative of this new formation.
[00:10:59.488 --> 00:11:09.056]  What needs to happen is the Democratic Party gets rejected like cancer, and then the Republican Party splits into the Christian right wing versus the Libertarian.
[00:11:09.116 --> 00:11:12.999]  I mean, that's what I've always thought it would split into if we're successful.
[00:11:13.019 --> 00:11:14.640]  That's what most analysts now say.
[00:11:14.961 --> 00:11:17.763]  Yes, I've been a trailblazer for 20 years, saying that should be the goal.
[00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:20.325]  Or you could debate what it splits into.
[00:11:21.166 --> 00:11:25.349]  First, there'll be four or five little new conservative parties, but it'll become dominant in the next decade.
[00:11:25.369 --> 00:11:28.552]  And then you'll have the Republican Party, the grand old party, and you'll have the new party.
[00:11:30.777 --> 00:11:32.137]  And that's basically where we are.
[00:11:32.197 --> 00:11:41.619]  Because the Democrats know that they want to basically outlaw and demonize and they've said Homeland Security on the Republicans.
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.120]  And it's not that Republicans are perfect.
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:47.481]  Half of them are really horrible up at the top, at least, probably 60%.
[00:11:47.561 --> 00:11:49.841]  If you really think about it, maybe more.
[00:11:50.321 --> 00:11:58.343]  But there's a beachhead growing and the constituency is awake and getting more awake by the day and getting more informed by the millisecond.
[00:11:59.338 --> 00:12:02.399]  So I've got a lot for you here before we get to the really good news.
[00:12:03.119 --> 00:12:04.899]  On the border, quite the stack.
[00:12:06.199 --> 00:12:20.422]  And you'll notice, whether you're in Germany, or France, or the UK, or Canada, or New York City, or Washington State, or California, I've got it all right here today.
[00:12:21.543 --> 00:12:22.763]  Without even looking, it's just everywhere.
[00:12:22.783 --> 00:12:27.564]  They're announcing, oh, we're going to give thousands of dollars free a month just on random debit cards.
[00:12:29.111 --> 00:12:29.972]  We're good to go.
[00:12:29.992 --> 00:12:30.492]  We're good to go.
[00:12:50.979 --> 00:12:56.724]  Safe houses all over Michigan, and they learned they were all over the country, but they busted them in Michigan, but then no charges were made.
[00:12:57.504 --> 00:13:02.709]  Falsifying ballots and voter registration cards, and there were whiteboards and documents how it was fraud.
[00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.292]  Smoking gun open and shut.
[00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:13.817]  Like when a serial killer gets caught with ten bodies in the backyard and the police bust them and go in the basement and there's videotapes of them torturing the kids?
[00:13:14.217 --> 00:13:15.899]  I mean, you're going to the electric chair.
[00:13:16.239 --> 00:13:17.440]  You're getting lethal injection.
[00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:20.904]  There's no... The jury's going to see you killing the kids.
[00:13:21.084 --> 00:13:22.325]  And they were found in your backyard.
[00:13:23.667 --> 00:13:24.748]  Okay, so it's...
[00:13:27.332 --> 00:13:27.692]  We're good to go.
[00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:49.169]  We're good to go.
[00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:49.329]  I think?
[00:14:11.544 --> 00:14:14.905]  But this is Alex Jones Sunday night, Info Awards, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:14:15.406 --> 00:14:16.806]  Been in this slot 16 years.
[00:14:17.346 --> 00:14:19.707]  Thought we would go six days a week, 16 years ago.
[00:14:20.148 --> 00:14:21.968]  Been on 11 a.m.
[00:14:22.008 --> 00:14:22.669]  to 3 p.m.
[00:14:22.709 --> 00:14:23.909]  Central since 1997.
[00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:30.272]  Man, time is just flying by.
[00:14:31.112 --> 00:14:38.855]  Okay, let's start with a little short compilation of Biden, and then we're going to drill into this big key stack.
[00:14:39.836 --> 00:14:40.336]  So go to clip 11.
[00:14:42.307 --> 00:14:46.972]  I would in fact make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[00:14:47.353 --> 00:14:49.015]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:50.216]  They deserve to be heard.
[00:14:50.717 --> 00:14:52.378]  A few moments later.
[00:14:52.619 --> 00:14:53.420]  Biden!
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:54.461]  Biden!
[00:14:54.741 --> 00:14:55.502]  Biden!
[00:14:55.782 --> 00:14:56.543]  Biden!
[00:14:56.823 --> 00:14:57.604]  Biden!
[00:14:57.845 --> 00:14:58.605]  Biden!
[00:14:58.906 --> 00:14:59.667]  Biden!
[00:14:59.947 --> 00:15:00.708]  Biden!
[00:15:00.948 --> 00:15:01.629]  Biden!
[00:15:05.427 --> 00:15:07.048]  A few moments later.
[00:15:07.649 --> 00:15:14.374]  Shocking new video shows the lawlessness of Democrat cities colliding with Joe Biden's open borders insanity.
[00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:22.400]  Two NYPD police officers getting outnumbered and savagely beaten by a large group of illegal immigrants near Times Square.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:28.744]  Those cops were just trying to break up a disorderly crowd outside a shelter, trying to arrest one of the illegals.
[00:15:29.325 --> 00:15:30.586]  And that's when the mob attacked.
[00:15:31.374 --> 00:15:34.976]  One of the thugs kicking an officer in the face while he's on the ground.
[00:15:35.557 --> 00:15:39.019]  He suffered a cut to his face, and the other officer was injured.
[00:15:39.699 --> 00:15:50.826]  Five of those violent suspects were arrested by police later that same night, charged with assaulting a police officer, but four of them already back on the street, released without bail.
[00:15:54.775 --> 00:16:10.179]  Given the unprecedented millions of Biden illegal aliens who are invading our country, it is only common sense that when I'm reelected, we will begin, and we have no choice, the largest deportation operation in American history.
[00:16:12.319 --> 00:16:13.040]  We have no choice.
[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.340]  Why were they released?
[00:16:28.025 --> 00:16:46.730]  Sir, you're on behalf of the people.
[00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:50.391]  Can you just comment on the situation?
[00:16:57.435 --> 00:17:07.600]  That's Alvin Bragg, the Soros DA, the Attorney General, of course, Jesus James of Soros, pledged she destroyed Trump, said it was all political.
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:24.187]  Here's Korean War veteran Frank Tamaro, 95, sorry, I said he was 93, and 53 other residents were kicked out of their New York nursing home on short notice so it could be turned into housing for illegal migrants.
[00:17:25.068 --> 00:17:25.548]  Here's a clip.
[00:17:27.728 --> 00:17:32.911]  It was very disgraceful what they did to the people in the island shores.
[00:17:33.871 --> 00:17:37.573]  They gave us time to get out.
[00:17:37.773 --> 00:17:39.094]  But they never said when.
[00:17:39.754 --> 00:17:42.115]  And they never said they were going to get us out.
[00:17:42.855 --> 00:17:52.380]  And then one day, there's a thing on the board, a notice on the board, you gotta be out by March 15th.
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.802]  I think that gave us like a month and a half
[00:17:56.567 --> 00:17:58.369]  To find out where we're going to go.
[00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:05.335]  I thought my suitcases were going to be on the curb because I'm not that fast.
[00:18:05.955 --> 00:18:09.078]  If it wasn't for my daughter, they would have been on the curb.
[00:18:10.619 --> 00:18:16.524]  But that's what happened and that was it.
[00:18:17.814 --> 00:18:20.496]  I said, no, no, no, no, you're not moving me.
[00:18:20.876 --> 00:18:23.877]  And they said, yes, yes, yes, we are.
[00:18:23.897 --> 00:18:27.700]  And everything was done behind closed doors.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:35.404]  We didn't have a chance to actually make any attempt to stop them because there wasn't enough time.
[00:18:36.785 --> 00:18:42.568]  But when Governor DeSantis shipped only two buses to Martha's Vineyard, they were gone in 14 hours.
[00:18:43.308 --> 00:18:46.070]  Now, that's bad enough, and they're kicking people out of their housing as well.
[00:18:47.096 --> 00:18:48.657]  But I can play you countless clips.
[00:18:48.677 --> 00:18:51.277]  You remember them all out of Europe, in Italy, in Germany.
[00:18:52.198 --> 00:18:58.300]  Little private motels kicking out the guests, putting the illegals in, not even paying the old man that owned the place.
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.641]  Kicking people out of their nursing homes.
[00:19:01.201 --> 00:19:02.981]  This is the plan, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:03.021 --> 00:19:04.202]  It's pure criminal activity.
[00:19:04.762 --> 00:19:09.684]  And the illegal aliens, MS-13 and others that Pelosi, remember, called all God's children.
[00:19:10.584 --> 00:19:22.093]  They have blue cities they go rob in, and they know they'll be let out by the Soros DAs and other prosecutors, and then they run back to other red states where people wouldn't put up with them.
[00:19:22.914 --> 00:19:33.742]  And here is CNN's Erica Hill's stunned speechless by report from law enforcement that illegal aliens run crews that operate in New York and do all their stealing, then go to Florida.
[00:19:33.762 --> 00:19:34.363]  Here's the report.
[00:19:35.544 --> 00:19:36.064]  We're back in New York.
[00:19:37.182 --> 00:19:39.123]  You don't touch our police officers.
[00:19:39.183 --> 00:19:40.244]  You don't touch anybody.
[00:19:40.284 --> 00:19:40.964]  Thank you, everybody.
[00:19:41.044 --> 00:19:45.507]  I mean, we're hearing a change when it comes to immigration in general from President Biden on down.
[00:19:45.527 --> 00:19:46.867]  Do you hear her talk about that?
[00:19:47.768 --> 00:19:50.950]  It is also directly related to the fact that these were police officers.
[00:19:51.977 --> 00:19:53.058]  Does that have any impact?
[00:19:53.098 --> 00:19:54.219]  Does that change anything?
[00:20:18.226 --> 00:20:22.712]  This hard-working, you know, throngs of people in search of hope and a better life.
[00:20:23.233 --> 00:20:27.838]  There is this one percenter, you know, criminal element that looks at a different opportunity here.
[00:20:28.459 --> 00:20:31.022]  These individuals, I went over their rap sheets yesterday.
[00:20:31.623 --> 00:20:36.549]  Multiple charges, grand larceny, robbery, attempted robbery, grand larceny, grand larceny.
[00:20:36.989 --> 00:20:37.570]  We're good to go.
[00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:37.830]  I think?
[00:20:55.624 --> 00:20:59.387]  I'm looking at the dates that their arrest started, which is probably close to when they got here.
[00:20:59.788 --> 00:21:01.069]  They've only been here a couple of months.
[00:21:01.649 --> 00:21:10.257]  So what the detectives are telling me is they have crews here that operate in New York, do all their stealing, then go to Florida to spend the money and then come back.
[00:21:10.297 --> 00:21:12.358]  And I'm like, well, why don't they just stay and steal in Florida?
[00:21:12.378 --> 00:21:13.980]  And they said, because there you go to jail.
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:14.580]  Oh.
[00:21:17.483 --> 00:21:18.043]  Great report.
[00:21:18.303 --> 00:21:19.144]  Keep us posted on this.
[00:21:19.184 --> 00:21:19.965]  Totally speechless.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:25.442]  Crime, violent crime has exploded to levels never before seen.
[00:21:25.502 --> 00:21:31.184]  But for three years, the FBI has made in over 100 cities, all the major cities, like 127 cities.
[00:21:31.444 --> 00:21:31.784]  Look it up.
[00:21:32.444 --> 00:21:34.145]  It was about three years ago it came out.
[00:21:34.165 --> 00:21:35.405]  FBI headline.
[00:21:35.425 --> 00:21:39.267]  FBI makes crime statistics from largest cities secret.
[00:21:41.127 --> 00:21:42.968]  And so they don't even show those numbers now.
[00:21:43.288 --> 00:21:47.490]  That's how they say, oh, crime's gone down under Biden.
[00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.490]  0.2%.
[00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:48.450]  That was one of the headlines.
[00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:49.411]  Crime down 0.2%.
[00:21:51.903 --> 00:21:53.224]  Just like, oh, inflation's down.
[00:21:53.304 --> 00:21:54.024]  Prices aren't up.
[00:21:54.084 --> 00:21:55.284]  You heard CNN.
[00:21:57.125 --> 00:22:03.227]  But then you've got so many Democrat lawmakers, state-level, federal, being kidnapped, murdered, shot, carjacked.
[00:22:03.807 --> 00:22:06.087]  Now a high-level former Trump official.
[00:22:08.288 --> 00:22:12.469]  The head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC.
[00:22:12.729 --> 00:22:14.110]  That's a very important agency.
[00:22:15.171 --> 00:22:18.013]  Went to pick up his wife at 7 o'clock at night in D.C.
[00:22:18.874 --> 00:22:25.540]  Guy jumps in, shoots him in the head for no reason, jumps out, runs and starts carjacking more vehicles, starts shooting at police and gets killed.
[00:22:28.882 --> 00:22:29.623]  Yeah, there's the headline.
[00:22:29.683 --> 00:22:30.564]  Murder rate mystery.
[00:22:30.624 --> 00:22:33.066]  New FBI crime stats don't include New York City, L.A.
[00:22:33.106 --> 00:22:34.287]  That's the Bloomberg whitewash.
[00:22:34.327 --> 00:22:36.569]  No, it's over 100-plus cities.
[00:22:37.269 --> 00:22:38.290]  There's Bloomberg, though, folks.
[00:22:38.971 --> 00:22:39.251]  You see?
[00:22:40.247 --> 00:22:42.349]  The FBI releases its annual national crime stats.
[00:22:42.369 --> 00:22:43.810]  The data is horribly incomplete.
[00:22:44.151 --> 00:22:51.317]  Oh, even the Guardian says, and I'm going from memory, but going to the articles, it was like 120, let's see how good my memory is, 123 cities.
[00:22:51.357 --> 00:22:52.939]  That was over 120.
[00:22:53.099 --> 00:23:02.608]  Do not, do not give any crime statistics while they defund the police and the rest of it.
[00:23:03.471 --> 00:23:04.891]  And I can tell you, I know Austin cops.
[00:23:04.911 --> 00:23:05.951]  They say, Jones, you're right.
[00:23:06.572 --> 00:23:08.692]  Don't go downtown anywhere after dark.
[00:23:09.352 --> 00:23:10.572]  Don't go to East Austin.
[00:23:10.632 --> 00:23:11.993]  Don't go to Northeast Austin.
[00:23:12.353 --> 00:23:14.113]  They said it is a war zone.
[00:23:15.533 --> 00:23:16.413]  No crime statistics.
[00:23:18.294 --> 00:23:19.174]  No crime statistics.
[00:23:20.194 --> 00:23:22.294]  There's not even statistics that are public.
[00:23:22.334 --> 00:23:24.755]  The police have them on police being assaulted.
[00:23:25.375 --> 00:23:26.695]  You hear about when they're getting killed, though.
[00:23:27.115 --> 00:23:28.976]  There have been a lot of funerals, right?
[00:23:30.976 --> 00:23:31.176]  So...
[00:23:33.007 --> 00:23:39.631]  As much as I don't like getting speeding tickets, and I've learned to not really speed, I don't ever see cops in Austin writing tickets anymore.
[00:23:39.651 --> 00:23:40.491]  I mean, never.
[00:23:43.312 --> 00:23:54.378]  They're all just bunkered down, because if they... They've charged a bunch of Austin cops that literally shoot somebody that's shooting at them, and then they go to jail.
[00:23:54.578 --> 00:23:55.439]  You've seen the headlines.
[00:23:57.102 --> 00:23:59.583]  I live in a town, folks, effectively with no police.
[00:24:00.323 --> 00:24:02.704]  You call them, they come right to your house, they're helpful, they're there.
[00:24:04.565 --> 00:24:06.886]  But they just don't respond.
[00:24:07.886 --> 00:24:11.327]  Because the DA is an admitted communist that George Soros put in.
[00:24:11.367 --> 00:24:12.207]  And that's where I live.
[00:24:14.328 --> 00:24:16.649]  Folks, they've had mass shootings in Austin.
[00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:21.691]  And they release the shooters the next day.
[00:24:24.619 --> 00:24:25.339]  Did you hear what I just said?
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.220]  You're like, really?
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:26.900]  I didn't hear about that.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.561]  Well, it was barely in the local news.
[00:24:30.202 --> 00:24:36.925]  This is so horrible, folks, because the way we work is, if we're not being given the general knowledge, we don't know what's going on.
[00:24:37.866 --> 00:24:41.828]  And we have a weaponized government at war with us.
[00:24:42.688 --> 00:24:44.969]  Now, the cop is not the enemy on average.
[00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:47.450]  The bureaucrat's not the enemy.
[00:24:47.491 --> 00:24:50.432]  But, again, I've met with high-level federal judges, prosecutors,
[00:24:51.326 --> 00:24:51.827]  You name it.
[00:24:51.867 --> 00:24:52.847]  Federal Marshals, you name it.
[00:24:52.867 --> 00:24:53.388]  Border Patrol.
[00:24:53.968 --> 00:24:59.973]  They had huge whistleblowers this week down there with Chase Geyser and Tim Enloe talking to them.
[00:24:59.993 --> 00:25:01.754]  Border Patrol sent me some really nice gifts.
[00:25:01.794 --> 00:25:08.440]  I appreciate the little police dog they sent to my daughter, my youngest daughter, and some of the commemorative coins they sent me.
[00:25:09.861 --> 00:25:17.587]  And these Border Patrol commemorative coins are anti-Biden's.
[00:25:20.399 --> 00:25:23.140]  And I'm told these are passed out all over the place.
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.302]  So the government is too big.
[00:25:26.342 --> 00:25:26.962]  It's out of control.
[00:25:27.002 --> 00:25:27.982]  But it's not the enemy.
[00:25:28.242 --> 00:25:31.484]  It's the people that have hijacked it.
[00:25:31.644 --> 00:25:46.410]  And again, it's on record that, and I've got news articles today about it, that they will catch somebody that's got multiple armed robberies, multiple arson, multiple rape, multiple... I mean, one case, I said five.
[00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:47.150]  It was four.
[00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:48.130]  They caught him the fifth time.
[00:25:48.791 --> 00:25:49.111]  Four...
[00:25:50.393 --> 00:25:57.859]  Convictions over the last decade of raping kids, things from El Salvador, something I forget, was from Central America or South America.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.342]  Because the judge said, check this case out, it's on record, no one's covered it.
[00:26:02.362 --> 00:26:04.724]  We went and looked it up months ago, six months ago, and showed it to you on air.
[00:26:04.744 --> 00:26:05.945]  I forget all the details.
[00:26:07.146 --> 00:26:08.827]  They just said, look at this case, South Texas.
[00:26:09.528 --> 00:26:11.829]  Fifth time he got caught raping kids.
[00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:14.211]  He'd already been convicted four times.
[00:26:15.232 --> 00:26:15.732]  And they went...
[00:26:16.738 --> 00:26:17.238]  We're good to go.
[00:26:38.604 --> 00:26:39.585]  We're good to go.
[00:27:08.063 --> 00:27:08.223]  I think?
[00:27:32.045 --> 00:27:35.226]  This is to make everything shut down and collapse.
[00:27:35.686 --> 00:27:36.707]  It's the Great Reset.
[00:27:36.787 --> 00:27:38.327]  It's the post-industrial world.
[00:27:39.708 --> 00:27:42.169]  So I said at the bottom of the hour I'd get into the big positive news.
[00:27:42.189 --> 00:27:44.389]  This is positive, too, because people are waking up.
[00:27:44.929 --> 00:27:52.652]  But it'll take me another segment to finish the border stuff because there's just so much here that needs to be gotten into.
[00:27:52.772 --> 00:27:56.173]  So we're going to be coming back and getting into all of that.
[00:27:56.193 --> 00:27:57.954]  I left my ringer on my...
[00:27:59.403 --> 00:28:00.523]  My middle daughter's calling me.
[00:28:00.803 --> 00:28:01.884]  I need to get on the phone with her.
[00:28:02.384 --> 00:28:04.484]  But I left my ringer on.
[00:28:05.284 --> 00:28:06.004]  She's a sweetie pie.
[00:28:06.745 --> 00:28:14.286]  But we're going to go over at least a screenshot, you know, kind of a snapshot of this because there's just so much.
[00:28:14.326 --> 00:28:16.066]  But I've already said all this stuff.
[00:28:16.106 --> 00:28:17.507]  I'm going to show you the articles now.
[00:28:17.807 --> 00:28:22.208]  And you can screenshot each article right down the headline or video clip.
[00:28:22.228 --> 00:28:23.508]  You can go look it up and it's true, okay?
[00:28:24.685 --> 00:28:25.926]  So just remember that.
[00:28:26.126 --> 00:28:29.308]  That's how the leftist administrative revolution is happening.
[00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:32.771]  All right, folks, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:28:32.811 --> 00:28:34.272]  So much more coming up tonight.
[00:28:34.912 --> 00:28:38.755]  Yeah, we're in rough times, but at least we got a fighting chance and at least people are waking up.
[00:28:39.195 --> 00:28:46.440]  Whether you're black, brown, white, old, young, if you love liberty and freedom, we're all brothers and sisters together, folks.
[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:52.064]  Be sure and follow us on RealAlexJonesOnX as well at InfoWars.com and Band.Video.
[00:28:52.464 --> 00:28:53.044]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:53.084 --> 00:28:53.565]  Please stay with us.
[00:28:59.591 --> 00:29:03.117]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[00:29:03.497 --> 00:29:10.528]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[00:29:10.709 --> 00:29:12.712]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[00:29:12.892 --> 00:29:13.954]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[00:29:14.014 --> 00:29:14.675]  He loved the idea.
[00:29:14.995 --> 00:29:18.520]  What would you call the debate and discussion about a pro-human future?
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:19.421]  Just Team Humanity?
[00:29:19.481 --> 00:29:20.382]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[00:29:20.522 --> 00:29:20.963]  Absolutely.
[00:29:21.283 --> 00:29:22.685]  And so we have the t-shirt.

[00:29:47.465 --> 00:29:48.446]  We're told we're killing the Earth.
[00:29:48.746 --> 00:29:53.008]  We're told all this garbage so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[00:29:53.308 --> 00:29:54.008]  We're not going to do that.

[00:29:59.631 --> 00:30:04.933]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing, high-quality coffee has not been available.
[00:30:05.393 --> 00:30:09.755]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[00:30:10.216 --> 00:30:12.677]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[00:30:13.237 --> 00:30:22.621]  But now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.

[00:30:59.773 --> 00:31:06.157]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the globalist agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[00:31:07.563 --> 00:31:20.527]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections masquerading as vaccines.
[00:31:20.687 --> 00:31:29.689]  It is so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives oblivious, and you realize ignorance is not bliss, it equals death.
[00:31:31.325 --> 00:31:51.761]  But people are starting to really understand how serious things are, and that's a hard thing to do, because to wake up to a disturbing reality and realize that we're in the middle of a giant biological weapon war against humanity, and that there's mass sterilization that's already taking place, and they're cutting off all the major energy sources, is really hard to deal with, but it's the reality.
[00:31:52.342 --> 00:31:56.525]  Facing it is our only chance to turn this around, because stuff's about to get really, really nasty.
[00:31:56.925 --> 00:31:57.546]  Infowars.com.
[00:31:59.454 --> 00:32:01.717]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[00:32:01.897 --> 00:32:02.237]  Thank you.
[00:32:02.438 --> 00:32:04.981]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[00:32:05.061 --> 00:32:06.322]  I started taking that stuff.
[00:32:06.382 --> 00:32:09.546]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[00:32:09.666 --> 00:32:10.567]  When did you start taking it?
[00:32:10.848 --> 00:32:14.612]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure, and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[00:32:14.632 --> 00:32:14.792]  Mm-hmm.
[00:32:15.453 --> 00:32:18.155]  And I started eating a little better, but my blood pressure stayed high.
[00:32:18.175 --> 00:32:25.700]  And when I took the X2 iodine after about two or four weeks, I think my body's detoxified of a bunch of metals and stuff that my body was storing.
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.022]  And my blood pressure came down to the perfect level.
[00:32:28.402 --> 00:32:31.324]  And I tell people the only thing I did was X2 iodine.
[00:32:31.704 --> 00:32:32.344]  I think we're good.
[00:33:00.945 --> 00:33:06.869]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:20.758 --> 00:33:27.143]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:30.865 --> 00:33:31.785]  I love Alex Jones.
[00:33:31.805 --> 00:33:32.545]  I love Alex Jones.
[00:33:33.206 --> 00:33:34.566]  I love Alex Jones.
[00:33:34.766 --> 00:33:37.107]  This is like one of the most amazing things that I've ever seen.
[00:33:37.127 --> 00:33:44.068]  I think it's the black helicopter turning everyone gay.

[00:34:05.605 --> 00:34:07.787]  They just see the little InfoWars logo here on the mic.
[00:34:08.047 --> 00:34:09.448]  They've been screaming at us when they holler at us.
[00:34:09.488 --> 00:34:10.849]  We've been running up and talking to them.
[00:34:11.229 --> 00:34:12.310]  Everybody loves Alex Jones.
[00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:22.838]  Everybody's here carving out the time from their hard-working schedules to try to come and show support for Trump's reelection and antagonism for this Biden border invasion.
[00:34:23.058 --> 00:34:24.359]  What do you have to say to Alex Jones?
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:25.921]  Alex Jones is always right.
[00:34:26.001 --> 00:34:26.401]  Amen.
[00:34:26.921 --> 00:34:27.282]  Amen.

[00:34:34.628 --> 00:34:35.949]  Yeah, he's got good information.
[00:34:35.969 --> 00:34:36.730]  He's a smart man.
[00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:38.171]  I love Alex.
[00:34:38.271 --> 00:34:41.134]  I watch him all the time, and he opened my eyes.
[00:34:41.434 --> 00:34:42.275]  He's awesome, man.
[00:34:42.315 --> 00:34:43.156]  Yeah, good stuff.
[00:34:43.176 --> 00:34:44.177]  So good to have him back.
[00:34:44.457 --> 00:34:45.318]  Awesome, absolutely.
[00:34:45.338 --> 00:34:45.598]  Love it.
[00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:47.060]  Alex!
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.984]  Yeah!
[00:34:51.044 --> 00:34:53.827]  War Cry!

[00:35:00.704 --> 00:35:01.245]  Yeah, me too.
[00:35:01.305 --> 00:35:05.711]  He's the biggest conspiracy theorist out there, and they all come true.
[00:35:05.731 --> 00:35:06.712]  They all come true.
[00:35:06.812 --> 00:35:07.894]  What do you think of Alex Jones?
[00:35:08.354 --> 00:35:08.895]  He's awesome.
[00:35:09.035 --> 00:35:10.878]  He came from Canada to support the convoy.
[00:35:11.219 --> 00:35:11.479]  Awesome.
[00:35:11.499 --> 00:35:12.020]  Thanks for coming.

[00:35:16.245 --> 00:35:16.946]  He woke me up.
[00:35:17.026 --> 00:35:24.490]  I was kind of paying attention on the periphery for a while, and then he got so demonized, I was like, let me start paying attention to this guy.
[00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:26.691]  He's a wild man, but he's directionally correct.
[00:35:26.731 --> 00:35:27.471]  He's our wild man.
[00:35:27.611 --> 00:35:31.994]  And he's inspired me, and guys like you have inspired me to get my own little boots on the ground thing going here.

[00:35:47.625 --> 00:35:56.293]  You know, occasionally people want to call him out for being high-strung, but if the average person knows what he knows, they should be high-strung.
[00:35:56.393 --> 00:35:57.434]  That's absolutely right, man.
[00:35:57.535 --> 00:35:58.656]  Turbo Force Plus, high-strung.

[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:11.301]  I listen to him at work.
[00:36:11.561 --> 00:36:13.582]  What has this experience been like on this caravan for you?
[00:36:13.762 --> 00:36:15.683]  It's been a lot longer drive than I planned on.
[00:36:15.843 --> 00:36:17.064]  Just lean back and enjoy the ride.

[00:36:19.605 --> 00:36:19.965]  Yeah.
[00:36:20.066 --> 00:36:21.146]  Can we get a war cry?
[00:36:21.227 --> 00:36:24.629]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:26.051]  Tell us what you think of Alex Jones.
[00:36:26.691 --> 00:36:28.032]  Hey, Alex, what's up, brother?
[00:36:28.293 --> 00:36:28.753]  Love you.
[00:36:29.233 --> 00:36:31.275]  Yeah, big Alex Jones fan, man.
[00:36:31.295 --> 00:36:36.720]  I was just texting my girlfriend that I'd die a happy man if I see myself on InfoWars.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.461]  It's going to happen, but don't die.
[00:36:38.481 --> 00:36:41.644]  You don't have to die now that it's going to happen, okay?
[00:36:41.704 --> 00:36:44.467]  Swear to God, I texted that about 15 minutes ago, man.
[00:36:44.507 --> 00:36:45.948]  No word of a lie.
[00:36:46.008 --> 00:36:46.508]  That's right.
[00:36:48.813 --> 00:36:49.474]  I listened to you.
[00:36:49.534 --> 00:36:54.499]  I said, look, man, I've heard every excuse, every reason why people can't get out here.
[00:36:54.559 --> 00:36:57.101]  You know, I'm a busy, busy person.
[00:36:57.241 --> 00:37:03.767]  But look, we all got something else that we could be doing, but we carved the time out to do it.
[00:37:04.308 --> 00:37:05.048]  It's important.
[00:37:05.108 --> 00:37:07.390]  Nothing else is more important than this right now.
[00:37:08.051 --> 00:37:09.392]  You are the man.
[00:37:09.813 --> 00:37:10.513]  God bless you.
[00:37:10.593 --> 00:37:11.134]  God bless you.
[00:37:16.023 --> 00:37:32.436]  All right, so the Democrats are not just bringing in replacement voters or replacement population.
[00:37:33.137 --> 00:37:42.965]  They are giving these people cell phones and are telling them, we will deport you if you don't work where we say, vote how we say, and sign up with these NGOs.
[00:37:44.076 --> 00:37:57.525]  And these community organizer organizations, those are NGOs, Obama's plan for the domestic force bigger than the military, or just as big and just as strong as the military, if they don't follow their political orders, they're thrown out of the country.
[00:37:57.565 --> 00:38:03.089]  And Biden has now proposed, I have the AP right here, I'll show it to you, letting illegal aliens vote.
[00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:07.632]  And letting illegal aliens in prisons vote.
[00:38:09.313 --> 00:38:10.834]  And I hadn't actually read...
[00:38:12.369 --> 00:38:13.350]  The White House plan.
[00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:18.193]  They also have a legislation that got sent to me today, and I did read it, and it was worse than I thought.
[00:38:18.233 --> 00:38:19.594]  So let me just show you some of these headlines.
[00:38:20.915 --> 00:38:21.495]  This is AP.
[00:38:22.456 --> 00:38:26.158]  Biden to prioritize legal status for millions of immigrants.
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:33.263]  And when you read this, Elon Musk put it out and he said, number one, get as many illegals in the country as possible.
[00:38:33.283 --> 00:38:37.285]  Number two, legalize them to create a permanent majority, a one-party state.
[00:38:37.746 --> 00:38:38.886]  And he goes through the other plans.
[00:38:40.588 --> 00:38:41.108]  Here's Musk.
[00:38:46.235 --> 00:38:52.818]  If you bet you didn't know category, Homeland Security Mayorkas issued written guidance making it clear that Musk linked to it.
[00:38:53.758 --> 00:38:57.240]  Number one, illegal presence alone is not grounds for deportation.
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:02.202]  Number two, criminal charges, convictions of gang membership alone are not enough for deportation.
[00:39:02.482 --> 00:39:03.583]  That's the official guidelines.
[00:39:03.643 --> 00:39:07.965]  No, they don't let the Justice Department, the judges charge serious criminals.
[00:39:09.755 --> 00:39:12.156]  You're basically going to be convicted of axe murder to be deported.
[00:39:12.957 --> 00:39:14.077]  Actually, it's worse than that.
[00:39:14.618 --> 00:39:17.399]  That's because every deportation is a lost vote.
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:19.820]  Continuing.
[00:39:20.881 --> 00:39:21.861]  We already showed this clip.
[00:39:21.981 --> 00:39:22.262]  Watch.
[00:39:22.302 --> 00:39:29.705]  Manhattan DA Bragg repeatedly refuses to answer questions on why illegal aliens who brutally attacked NYPD officers were released.
[00:39:30.546 --> 00:39:34.148]  And it was the Migrant Center, the illegal alien center, that called him because of a riot.
[00:39:35.302 --> 00:39:41.446]  So you call the cops, and then they get beat up by a mob, and then the DA doesn't defend them.
[00:39:46.249 --> 00:39:59.997]  Only reason this criminal that killed the head of a major federal agency shot him in the head got killed was because he was already carjacking another car and shot at the cops.
[00:40:00.898 --> 00:40:02.139]  And they'll probably try to indict them.
[00:40:03.422 --> 00:40:06.103]  Ex-Trump official dies after being shot in violent D.C.
[00:40:06.143 --> 00:40:06.763]  carjacking.
[00:40:06.783 --> 00:40:18.026]  It is with profound sadness that I wish to inform you, the community, the passing of my husband, Mike Gill, said his wife, Christina Gill, in a statement reported by Fox 5 D.C.
[00:40:18.546 --> 00:40:22.707]  His sudden departure has left a void in our lives that can never be filled.
[00:40:24.107 --> 00:40:29.449]  Gill, who served as Trump's chief operating officer of the Commodities Future Trading Commission, CFTC,
[00:40:31.468 --> 00:40:45.857]  And a married father of three was sitting in his Jeep Cherokee waiting to pick up his wife near Mount Vernon Square on the evening of January 29th when the suspected gunman identified 28-year-old Artel Cunningham got inside the car and shot him in the head at 5.45 p.m.
[00:40:47.258 --> 00:40:48.959]  You watch all these gangbanging videos.
[00:40:48.999 --> 00:40:54.863]  They walk in the liquor store and the clerk gives them the cash and they shoot him in the head and then shoot him five, six more times.
[00:40:55.323 --> 00:40:57.465]  Or they walk over and demand your wallet at the gas pump.
[00:40:57.485 --> 00:40:58.926]  You give it to them and they shoot your ass.
[00:41:02.372 --> 00:41:09.581]  Cunningham then fled the scene on foot, attempted to carjack another individual unsuccessfully, then approached a man and a woman demanding their keys.
[00:41:10.361 --> 00:41:12.604]  Then he started shooting the police and got shot dead.
[00:41:14.787 --> 00:41:16.469]  This is every few minutes of this episode.
[00:41:19.311 --> 00:41:30.457]  A whole bunch of the legislatures in Maryland and Illinois and Washington State, you hear about the carjackings every day of members of the legislature.
[00:41:30.857 --> 00:41:32.538]  You only hear because they're a public figure.
[00:41:33.539 --> 00:41:34.499]  Imagine how bad it is.
[00:41:34.639 --> 00:41:35.600]  It's bad, folks.
[00:41:37.761 --> 00:41:42.784]  Really important, big, thick article on Infowars.com that you need to go get, you need to share.
[00:41:43.575 --> 00:41:47.478]  In fact, I'm going to have Jamie, who's out there, repost it in the live show feed so people can find it easier.
[00:41:47.918 --> 00:41:52.741]  Read, House Speaker lists 64 times Biden intentionally undermined border security.
[00:41:55.323 --> 00:41:56.984]  This article has all the receipts right here.
[00:41:57.004 --> 00:41:58.105]  I could spend the whole show on this.
[00:42:00.106 --> 00:42:03.709]  Bill Maher says, quote, Biden can fix border now.
[00:42:03.769 --> 00:42:05.290]  He already has the existing laws.
[00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:06.371]  Wow, that's what I said.
[00:42:07.772 --> 00:42:08.592]  That's what Trump said.
[00:42:08.672 --> 00:42:09.573]  Why is he saying that?
[00:42:09.653 --> 00:42:12.655]  Because he doesn't feel safe and he sees everybody's waking up.
[00:42:14.577 --> 00:42:18.098]  Elon Musk weighs in on Biden's strategy to get as many illegals in the country as possible.
[00:42:18.458 --> 00:42:20.379]  Create a permanent majority in a one-party state.
[00:42:21.559 --> 00:42:21.980]  Video.
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:23.560]  Tucker and Brett Weinstein.
[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:25.921]  Big professor, big scientist, big liberal.
[00:42:25.981 --> 00:42:26.741]  Now totally awake.
[00:42:27.181 --> 00:42:30.623]  Confirmed Infowars reporting of Chinese military aides invading America.
[00:42:30.883 --> 00:42:32.723]  Say this is a military invasion.
[00:42:33.103 --> 00:42:33.924]  And he explains it all.
[00:42:34.724 --> 00:42:36.565]  Same equipment, same boots, same everything.
[00:42:36.945 --> 00:42:37.905]  You can tell they're military.
[00:42:38.885 --> 00:42:39.686]  He was down there for a week.
[00:42:40.166 --> 00:42:41.386]  He said it was ridiculous.
[00:42:41.526 --> 00:42:42.267]  Like Red Dawn.
[00:42:43.067 --> 00:42:43.227]  Just...
[00:42:44.326 --> 00:42:47.048]  Marching battalions of foreign troops.
[00:42:47.429 --> 00:42:48.169]  Military-aged men.
[00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:52.393]  ICE supports illegal alien wanted for rape released in the U.S.
[00:42:52.433 --> 00:42:52.913]  under Biden.
[00:42:54.454 --> 00:42:55.555]  This is just stuff today.
[00:42:57.377 --> 00:42:58.798]  Now, here's where it gets really important.
[00:42:58.818 --> 00:43:01.920]  This is just today what I came across without even looking.
[00:43:02.401 --> 00:43:04.442]  If I wanted to show you a thousand articles, I could.
[00:43:07.365 --> 00:43:13.790]  DOE to push forward 1.2 billion Biden plan to expand federal college...
[00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:16.871]  Prep aid to illegal immigrants.
[00:43:21.015 --> 00:43:26.199]  New York City launches a $53 million program to issue prepaid credit cards to illegal migrant families.
[00:43:26.699 --> 00:43:27.640]  Nobody gets that.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:28.981]  Not even welfare queens.
[00:43:30.558 --> 00:43:31.138]  We're good to go.
[00:43:59.338 --> 00:44:01.199]  All taxpayer paid for through NGOs.
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:05.181]  Germany introduced prepaid cards for migrants.
[00:44:05.221 --> 00:44:07.081]  Again, this came out today.
[00:44:07.482 --> 00:44:08.842]  It's the same everywhere.
[00:44:10.783 --> 00:44:14.345]  That's the cards they get to get to the country.
[00:44:14.405 --> 00:44:16.085]  Now they give them to them once they're here.
[00:44:17.366 --> 00:44:20.147]  And now they're throwing veterans out of their public housing.
[00:44:21.428 --> 00:44:22.488]  We already played that earlier.
[00:44:23.489 --> 00:44:25.229]  Dr. Phil visits the open southern border.
[00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:28.151]  Says humanitarian crisis isn't like anything we've seen before.
[00:44:28.171 --> 00:44:28.231]  Yep.
[00:44:29.534 --> 00:44:30.254]  What did Biden say?
[00:44:30.274 --> 00:44:32.676]  He said, when I get elected, immediately surge the border.
[00:44:34.697 --> 00:44:37.038]  Oh, because you might be raped, as if all of them have been raped.
[00:44:37.558 --> 00:44:41.781]  And then they actually rape them financially and physically rape them once they get here.
[00:44:44.302 --> 00:44:46.323]  And it goes on and on.
[00:44:46.664 --> 00:44:47.204]  Yeah, here's one.
[00:44:47.584 --> 00:44:55.268]  Washington state diverted $340 million in federal COVID funds to migrants via $1,000 checks and debit cards.
[00:44:58.519 --> 00:44:59.820]  Blank cards.
[00:45:01.061 --> 00:45:11.888]  Can you imagine as a citizen, whether you're white, brown, black, old, young, whatever, the government just gives you a random card with no name on it with two, three, four, five thousand dollars, a thousand dollars on it?
[00:45:14.089 --> 00:45:14.710]  What is that?
[00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:16.791]  It's the incentive to get them here.
[00:45:18.812 --> 00:45:23.936]  Indiana schools are installing translation stations for students who don't understand English.
[00:45:23.956 --> 00:45:24.736]  Oh, isn't that nice?
[00:45:25.157 --> 00:45:27.018]  That it just wrecks all the education for everybody.
[00:45:28.976 --> 00:45:29.937]  You've all seen the footage.
[00:45:29.977 --> 00:45:35.621]  The illegals, after beating NYPD officers almost to death, flip off Americans upon release one day later.
[00:45:37.142 --> 00:45:38.203]  There's an arrogance.
[00:45:39.764 --> 00:45:41.626]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[00:45:43.267 --> 00:45:54.175]  Meanwhile, Obama advisor Axelrod on CNN admits it's a very successful policy of Republican governors shipping illegal aliens to blue cities because they don't want them.
[00:45:55.776 --> 00:45:57.037]  Alright, so that's that.
[00:45:58.379 --> 00:46:00.100]  I got some positive news I want to hit.
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:03.241]  But this is positive, too, because it's all coming out now.
[00:46:03.501 --> 00:46:04.761]  And this is just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:46:04.801 --> 00:46:08.703]  I mean, I literally, this is like a third of what I've read or looked at the last few days.
[00:46:08.723 --> 00:46:11.184]  This is just a small, small piece here.
[00:46:16.448 --> 00:46:17.969]  I'm going to hit this positive news.
[00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:19.650]  And it's not just this story.
[00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:25.475]  I'm saying this mindset, this response, this action is what we should all be doing.
[00:46:25.755 --> 00:46:27.957]  And you're going to hear me say, well, of course we know that.
[00:46:28.777 --> 00:46:30.198]  Okay, well, it's not being done enough.
[00:46:31.179 --> 00:46:38.825]  Just because you know if I go jog every day and lift weights, I'll live longer, be healthier, doesn't mean, let me tell you, I know this myself, doesn't mean you actually do it.
[00:46:39.806 --> 00:46:45.110]  Just as we all know, eating our vegetables is good doesn't mean that we shouldn't keep telling our kids to do it because they're not doing it.
[00:46:46.991 --> 00:46:51.380]  But before I go any further, speaking of eating your vegetables, I'm not perfect.
[00:46:51.401 --> 00:46:52.222]  I'm under a lot of stress.
[00:46:52.242 --> 00:46:56.411]  But if I didn't have the supplements we have, we promote, I wouldn't be able to continue to be on air.
[00:46:57.845 --> 00:46:58.426]  We're good to go.
[00:47:21.741 --> 00:47:26.984]  Nitric Boost, without even knowing, became our number three bestseller because people loved it so much.
[00:47:27.004 --> 00:47:27.945]  They had such great effects.
[00:47:27.965 --> 00:47:34.429]  It's got all these natural compounds that clean out the blood, open up your arteries and veins, encapsulators, clean out your heart, your brain, everything.
[00:47:35.229 --> 00:47:36.970]  Well, we got an even better manufacturer.
[00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:41.853]  The other one was great, but one that's even better with even higher quality ingredients at a lower price.
[00:47:42.834 --> 00:47:47.537]  So I could never offer Nitric Boost because it cost us so much to make.
[00:47:48.717 --> 00:47:51.019]  We just went to the company that actually makes it for the subcompany.
[00:47:52.068 --> 00:47:52.708]  We're good to go.
[00:47:52.728 --> 00:47:52.989]  I think?
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:10.261]  And then we're like, God, this thing costs us a lot.
[00:48:10.301 --> 00:48:11.321]  We cannot discount it.
[00:48:11.941 --> 00:48:15.602]  Well, we just said, well, let's look around and get somebody else to make the same formula.
[00:48:16.062 --> 00:48:19.423]  Oh, we happened to make some calls and find out who was making it for the other company.
[00:48:19.943 --> 00:48:22.084]  So we cut the price by 20% for us.
[00:48:22.504 --> 00:48:23.904]  We just passed it on to you.
[00:48:24.504 --> 00:48:25.684]  So 25% off.
[00:48:26.645 --> 00:48:27.805]  The savings is now yours.
[00:48:27.825 --> 00:48:29.685]  40% off.
[00:48:30.506 --> 00:48:31.306]  Nitric boost.
[00:48:32.506 --> 00:48:34.567]  And even better than the last formula.
[00:48:34.607 --> 00:48:35.647]  You go, well, why is it
[00:48:36.806 --> 00:48:37.567]  We're good to go.
[00:48:37.587 --> 00:48:37.987]  We're good to go.
[00:48:38.007 --> 00:48:39.048]  We're good to go.
[00:49:04.426 --> 00:49:05.407]  I'm 60 years old.
[00:49:05.627 --> 00:49:07.509]  Why am I waking up in the morning like I'm 18?
[00:49:08.469 --> 00:49:12.072]  Because it opens up all your blood vessels, folks.
[00:49:13.053 --> 00:49:14.014]  That's nothing but good.
[00:49:14.434 --> 00:49:15.255]  It does it all natural.
[00:49:15.775 --> 00:49:18.637]  Infowarsstore.com, nitric boost, finally back in stock.
[00:49:20.059 --> 00:49:23.561]  40% off out of the gates and selling out.
[00:49:23.621 --> 00:49:25.143]  We knew it would in a limited run.
[00:49:26.741 --> 00:49:33.782]  Next level foundational energy, methylfolate, the highest organic quality with a key complex of vitamins that supercharge it.
[00:49:34.483 --> 00:49:40.984]  And if you don't know what methylfolate is, it's the breakdown of folic acid that is the total cellular energy, anti-cancer, everything.
[00:49:41.724 --> 00:49:42.964]  It's pure energy for your cells.
[00:49:42.984 --> 00:49:45.745]  So it's not like caffeine that stimulates your cells.
[00:49:45.845 --> 00:49:47.305]  It's just pure energy for your cells.
[00:49:47.645 --> 00:49:51.606]  So it gives, in my experience, so much energy, I can't take it.
[00:49:53.223 --> 00:49:55.624]  I mean, because I've only done cocaine three times.
[00:49:55.944 --> 00:49:57.365]  I've done Adderall two or three times.
[00:49:57.705 --> 00:49:58.666]  I'm honest about this.
[00:49:58.706 --> 00:49:59.906]  In my life, I've tried this and that.
[00:49:59.926 --> 00:50:00.987]  Never injected heroin.
[00:50:01.407 --> 00:50:01.927]  Never been in it.
[00:50:01.947 --> 00:50:03.308]  But I'm like, okay, I'll try that once.
[00:50:03.748 --> 00:50:04.868]  I've taken acid before.
[00:50:04.908 --> 00:50:05.949]  I've taken mushrooms before.
[00:50:06.269 --> 00:50:07.250]  But I'm not a drug guy.
[00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:08.590]  I like alcohol and caffeine.
[00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:09.811]  I don't even really do a lot of that.
[00:50:10.651 --> 00:50:12.212]  But the point is, I'm being honest with you.
[00:50:14.493 --> 00:50:14.653]  But...
[00:50:17.648 --> 00:50:21.570]  I don't like stimulants other than like coffee or some turbo force or whatever.
[00:50:22.051 --> 00:50:23.731]  But I still got to be careful with it.
[00:50:24.652 --> 00:50:26.113]  I can't even take this, folks.
[00:50:26.793 --> 00:50:27.093]  Okay?
[00:50:28.154 --> 00:50:35.378]  I mean, all you got to do is get Next Level Foundational Energy and just listen to me and just try it.
[00:50:35.918 --> 00:50:37.819]  Now, again, it depends on how your cells work.
[00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:39.140]  It's genetic.
[00:50:40.521 --> 00:50:42.222]  Black people, look it up.
[00:50:43.417 --> 00:50:45.119]  We're good to go.
[00:50:56.872 --> 00:50:57.513]  We're good to go.
[00:51:18.957 --> 00:51:23.399]  They get 90 plus percent processing of methylfolate.
[00:51:23.999 --> 00:51:28.421]  Their cells can take folic acid and turn it into methylfolate.
[00:51:29.102 --> 00:51:36.305]  The more northern European you are, or Japanese, or some northern Chinese, I have great genes.
[00:51:36.825 --> 00:51:38.226]  I've been tested by two different top companies.
[00:51:39.246 --> 00:51:41.007]  But both companies told me the same thing.
[00:51:41.107 --> 00:51:43.088]  One told me, let me do another company and see if this is true.
[00:51:43.508 --> 00:51:44.149]  Totally different company.
[00:51:44.169 --> 00:51:46.910]  They said, there are four genes in your mitochondria.
[00:51:48.052 --> 00:51:52.454]  And I have a bunch of other super genes in my cells, but on this area I was weak.
[00:51:53.335 --> 00:51:54.936]  I had two and a half of the genes broken.
[00:51:56.297 --> 00:51:56.557]  Okay?
[00:51:56.917 --> 00:51:58.738]  If you have three broken, you've got a big problem.
[00:51:58.758 --> 00:51:59.999]  That's two and a half.
[00:52:00.499 --> 00:52:02.860]  If you have four, you die when you're like a year old.
[00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:03.280]  Okay?
[00:52:03.521 --> 00:52:07.503]  So I do not process folic acid.
[00:52:08.944 --> 00:52:12.906]  And so I'll take like half a capsule because you can break them open.
[00:52:14.292 --> 00:52:14.732]  Let me show you.
[00:52:15.672 --> 00:52:17.413]  I'll take like, because I can't even take a whole capsule.
[00:52:17.833 --> 00:52:32.697]  I'll do like a green, one of our green drinks in the morning, and I'll take the capsule every morning, and I pull it open, and I put half a capsule in my green drink, because when I get what I haven't had, my body goes so crazy, and I'm so focused, I turn into a complete jerk.
[00:52:33.277 --> 00:52:36.057]  Because I'm, I mean, it's, I'm hiring a kite.
[00:52:36.998 --> 00:52:38.378]  I can't drink coffee on this.
[00:52:38.758 --> 00:52:42.099]  Most days I don't even take it, because my body has not had this.
[00:52:43.123 --> 00:52:45.184]  So, methylfolate, folks.
[00:52:45.284 --> 00:52:46.224]  I'm Northern European.
[00:52:46.884 --> 00:52:49.645]  I've got two and a half of my four genes broken in my mitochondria.
[00:52:49.965 --> 00:52:51.445]  I do not process folic acid.
[00:52:52.045 --> 00:52:56.086]  Again, you know about, even the old timers didn't know about vitamins or minerals, but they knew.
[00:52:56.106 --> 00:52:58.207]  You eat a bunch of spinach, you're strong.
[00:52:58.387 --> 00:52:59.787]  Because it's full of folic acid.
[00:53:00.107 --> 00:53:08.769]  And Popeye's getting his ass kicked by Bluto, or by the sea hag, or by a big buzzard, and he pops open the spinach and he kicks its ass.
[00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:11.550]  Well, what if Popeye couldn't process the spinach?
[00:53:12.495 --> 00:53:19.801]  So I've got to eat, basically, a giant spinach salad to get what a black person gets eating two leaves of spinach.
[00:53:19.841 --> 00:53:22.183]  And that's basically a way to give an analogy.
[00:53:22.223 --> 00:53:24.285]  It's not completely technical, but that's kind of what it is.
[00:53:24.665 --> 00:53:27.488]  A black person eats like three or four pieces of that.
[00:53:27.508 --> 00:53:29.189]  They get what they need.
[00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:34.674]  Well, this Popeye needs a whole giant bowl to be able to even get the same thing.
[00:53:36.411 --> 00:53:38.873]  Well, not with this, because it's not folic acid.
[00:53:39.273 --> 00:53:43.656]  It's the breakdown of the folic acid that the cells produce, and it is Popeye.
[00:53:44.016 --> 00:53:45.997]  And I am not a nice person when I'm Popeye.
[00:53:46.818 --> 00:53:47.718]  And I feel like Popeye.
[00:53:48.759 --> 00:53:50.460]  So I've just had a longer plug.
[00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:51.021]  I shouldn't have done it.
[00:53:51.041 --> 00:53:52.081]  I've got so much news to head.
[00:53:52.101 --> 00:53:54.843]  And we're about to sell all this anyway, so I don't know why I'm plugging it so much.
[00:53:54.883 --> 00:53:59.246]  But when I tell you something's badass, folks, this is the real Popeye stuff right here.
[00:53:59.706 --> 00:53:59.946]  Okay?
[00:54:00.387 --> 00:54:02.228]  This is it, especially if you're white.
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:04.020]  And I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:54:04.501 --> 00:54:05.541]  And again, everything's genetic.
[00:54:05.581 --> 00:54:09.804]  It's like black people don't absorb vitamin D3 is good.
[00:54:10.444 --> 00:54:14.366]  And then they also need more sun during the winter and have incredible health problems.
[00:54:14.446 --> 00:54:15.387]  So it's all genetic.
[00:54:15.407 --> 00:54:16.567]  I'm not putting down white people here.
[00:54:17.087 --> 00:54:18.528]  White people have got some genetic issues.
[00:54:18.648 --> 00:54:20.609]  It's like sickle cell anemia.
[00:54:20.649 --> 00:54:21.970]  It's black people, not white people.
[00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:25.272]  We're all made the same by God, but a little bit different.
[00:54:26.644 --> 00:54:32.826]  And it all goes back to the past and our ancestors and what they went through and who survived and who didn't survive and all the rest of it.
[00:54:32.846 --> 00:54:40.628]  But while you're at InfoWarsTore.com, I want you to get a Team Humanity shirt about coming together and unifying against the globalists.
[00:54:40.948 --> 00:54:45.149]  I want you to get the new 1776 Gadsden flag design shirt.
[00:54:45.549 --> 00:54:47.169]  These are fundraisers, and I appreciate your support.
[00:54:47.329 --> 00:54:48.089]  Okay, I'm going to stop.
[00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:51.430]  I didn't mean to do a six, seven-minute plug.
[00:54:51.490 --> 00:54:52.471]  It's so exciting.
[00:54:52.491 --> 00:54:53.791]  These products are so good.
[00:54:55.038 --> 00:55:00.663]  And I would not take Turbo Force Plus or Brain Force Plus or Brain Force Ultra.
[00:55:00.683 --> 00:55:01.604]  They're all different nootropics.
[00:55:02.224 --> 00:55:04.746]  I would not take them with the methylfolate.
[00:55:05.267 --> 00:55:06.228]  Just do not do it.
[00:55:06.748 --> 00:55:09.451]  And again, most people say, oh, this proprietary brand works so good.
[00:55:09.471 --> 00:55:10.191]  It's so incredible.
[00:55:10.972 --> 00:55:11.592]  Only we have it.
[00:55:11.652 --> 00:55:12.253]  I'm not going to lie to you.
[00:55:12.553 --> 00:55:13.994]  You can get methylfolate anywhere.
[00:55:14.355 --> 00:55:16.116]  Not all methylfolates made the same.
[00:55:16.176 --> 00:55:16.957]  Not all of it's good.
[00:55:17.217 --> 00:55:17.998]  But all of it works.
[00:55:18.558 --> 00:55:19.719]  So you may go buy it somewhere else.
[00:55:20.765 --> 00:55:24.746]  Where else do you buy a product and then fund something, sell them through, have such a giant effect?
[00:55:24.766 --> 00:55:25.786]  All right, I'm going to stop there.
[00:55:27.067 --> 00:55:32.528]  We're going to break in a few minutes because I can do this now, but I don't have time.
[00:55:33.568 --> 00:55:36.869]  I got a big stack here of positive news.
[00:55:37.930 --> 00:55:39.590]  And again, it's not just good things that are happening.
[00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:44.151]  If we implement this, it's game over for the New World Order, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:45.011 --> 00:55:47.072]  Absolutely game over.
[00:55:48.427 --> 00:55:49.028]  We're good to go.
[00:56:06.744 --> 00:56:07.565]  Liberty to tell you all of it.
[00:56:07.585 --> 00:56:08.805]  I talked to Tucker yesterday and today.
[00:56:09.666 --> 00:56:12.007]  He's really causing a firestorm being over there.
[00:56:12.587 --> 00:56:16.790]  We'll discuss the neocons calling for him to be barred from the United States next hour.
[00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:22.333]  We've also got the big news on Trump dominating Biden.
[00:56:22.393 --> 00:56:27.075]  Biden trailing Trump by 20 points on economy as approval rating plunges.
[00:56:27.976 --> 00:56:30.697]  And what is the deep state going to try to pull to counter that?
[00:56:30.717 --> 00:56:33.099]  We've got the latest Jack Smith news.
[00:56:34.406 --> 00:56:35.427]  And so much more.
[00:56:35.447 --> 00:56:38.090]  Hour number two tonight.
[00:56:39.631 --> 00:56:44.677]  And I'm just so blessed to be here and so honored because we've come a long way in 30 years of the fight.
[00:56:45.672 --> 00:56:49.415]  And man, things aren't perfect, but at least we're not lying down and telling you.
[00:56:49.435 --> 00:57:00.144]  So again, I cannot express upon you how thankful I am for the crew, how thankful I am to all the listeners and viewers, how thankful I am for my tough family that's been put through hell just because they're my family.
[00:57:00.444 --> 00:57:01.405]  They've targeted my family.
[00:57:01.665 --> 00:57:02.405]  And we're tough.
[00:57:02.445 --> 00:57:03.586]  My family just don't talk about it.
[00:57:04.707 --> 00:57:06.749]  My family actually tells me, don't back down.
[00:57:07.069 --> 00:57:08.150]  Don't even compromise.
[00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:12.113]  Don't even settle with anybody.
[00:57:12.173 --> 00:57:12.874]  Let's go to war.
[00:57:14.978 --> 00:57:15.439]  We're good to go.
[00:57:41.715 --> 00:57:42.275]  All right, well, good.
[00:57:42.295 --> 00:57:43.216]  I just wanted to talk to you.
[00:57:43.616 --> 00:57:45.878]  They're like, well, you shouldn't even ask us about something like that.
[00:57:46.098 --> 00:57:47.580]  We expect you to attack these people.
[00:57:51.703 --> 00:57:53.124]  Last year, we put this book out.
[00:57:53.945 --> 00:57:55.366]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[00:57:55.386 --> 00:57:57.167]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[00:57:57.748 --> 00:58:01.010]  Now we've put part two out, and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[00:58:01.531 --> 00:58:06.354]  The Great Awakening, the plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[00:58:06.775 --> 00:58:08.416]  This is such a powerful book.
[00:58:08.816 --> 00:58:10.518]  It covers all the globalist plans.
[00:58:11.118 --> 00:58:11.598]  We're good to go.
[00:58:30.305 --> 00:58:37.809]  This is next-level information, and it's a great way to not just support the broadcast, but inform yourself to the next level and share the book with friends and family.
[00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:44.432]  So whether you want one copy or multiple copies, go now to InfoWarsStore.com and get The Great Awakening.
[00:58:44.633 --> 00:58:45.833]  This is going to go to number one.
[00:58:45.853 --> 00:58:47.174]  I want to thank you for your support.
[00:58:47.354 --> 00:58:48.154]  It's a powerful book.
[00:58:48.395 --> 00:58:48.935]  Get yours now.
[00:58:49.554 --> 00:58:53.277]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[00:58:53.597 --> 00:58:56.759]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[00:58:57.159 --> 00:59:01.642]  Because they can't get through this giant megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[00:59:02.263 --> 00:59:04.384]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[00:59:04.704 --> 00:59:12.689]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's You Will Eat the Bugs.
[00:59:13.310 --> 00:59:14.631]  This is The Great Awakening.
[00:59:15.091 --> 00:59:15.832]  We're good to go.
[00:59:30.009 --> 00:59:30.589]  We're good to go.
[00:59:30.889 --> 00:59:31.709]  We're good to go.
[00:59:31.749 --> 00:59:32.790]  We're good to go.
[01:00:03.564 --> 01:00:05.205]  Come home with your shields.
[01:00:05.585 --> 01:00:09.066]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:00:09.827 --> 01:00:16.149]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.410 --> 01:00:18.310]  Come home with your shields or on them.
[01:00:18.330 --> 01:00:20.551]  That's what the Spartan women would tell their men when they went out to battle.
[01:00:21.592 --> 01:00:25.193]  They would carry in dead men, two men holding a shield with a dead man over it.
[01:00:25.954 --> 01:00:28.995]  I just love my family telling me, come back with your shield or on it.
[01:00:30.086 --> 01:00:31.807]  I'm just like, okay, making sure.
[01:00:31.827 --> 01:00:33.108]  I'm taking the gloves off.
[01:00:33.128 --> 01:00:35.369]  They're like, we don't even expect you to ask us that.
[01:00:36.070 --> 01:00:36.890]  We're fully behind you.
[01:00:37.711 --> 01:00:38.792]  That feels really good, folks.
[01:00:39.332 --> 01:00:40.953]  And it's good to have all you behind me as well.
[01:00:40.993 --> 01:00:41.413]  I'm behind you.
[01:00:41.433 --> 01:00:42.834]  You better damn well believe that.
[01:00:43.955 --> 01:00:44.876]  Very, very honored to be here.
[01:00:44.916 --> 01:00:45.576]  Very, very blessed.
[01:00:45.856 --> 01:00:47.197]  And I appreciate you all putting up with me.
[01:00:47.617 --> 01:00:48.478]  I'm certainly not perfect.
[01:00:48.518 --> 01:00:48.978]  Far from it.
[01:00:49.599 --> 01:00:53.581]  Okay, you know, some stations don't carry this segment, but a lot do.
[01:00:53.741 --> 01:00:56.863]  And after I cover this next big topic, next segment, I'm going to get to this.
[01:00:56.903 --> 01:00:57.444]  So I want to air...
[01:00:58.792 --> 01:00:59.352]  A piece of this.
[01:00:59.392 --> 01:01:02.934]  Now, I put a bunch of these out on X at Real Alex Jones today, four or five of these.
[01:01:02.954 --> 01:01:03.895]  This is just one of them.
[01:01:04.675 --> 01:01:19.682]  But they've got big polls, major Gallup polls, NBC polls, you name it, all showing Trump 20 points behind in the national election, 5 to 7 to 10 points in battleground states.
[01:01:20.042 --> 01:01:21.943]  Remember, they're oversampling Democrats.
[01:01:23.604 --> 01:01:24.805]  And so it's way worse than that.
[01:01:25.731 --> 01:01:28.033]  But they've got their little tricks up their sleeves.
[01:01:28.053 --> 01:01:30.034]  So I'm going to be getting to that.
[01:01:30.415 --> 01:01:33.117]  The biggest election fraud evidence of 2020 has now come out.
[01:01:33.657 --> 01:01:36.560]  The FBI's been sitting on it for three years.
[01:01:37.641 --> 01:01:39.422]  But now the information is out.
[01:01:39.942 --> 01:01:43.605]  We're going to be getting to that as well here today.
[01:01:44.611 --> 01:01:48.113]  And as I said, the great Chase Geyser did a great job with the crew.
[01:01:48.133 --> 01:01:51.735]  I give them a better job than I've done sometimes when I'm down there.
[01:01:52.035 --> 01:01:53.076]  But we've always done a great job.
[01:01:53.096 --> 01:01:54.977]  There's so much to cover you really can't miss.
[01:01:55.017 --> 01:01:58.299]  But the whistleblowing information they got was huge.
[01:01:58.319 --> 01:02:00.040]  It was a big story, but it should have been a lot bigger.
[01:02:01.421 --> 01:02:04.563]  The NSA rebelling, not wanting to turn on face scanning stuff against citizens.
[01:02:05.970 --> 01:02:07.011]  The Fed's putting out a fake.
[01:02:07.251 --> 01:02:09.552]  The FBI put out a fake terror alert.
[01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:13.354]  The white supremacists were going to attack the illegal aliens and the Border Patrol.
[01:02:13.475 --> 01:02:15.336]  And it was the Border Patrol telling us this is all fake.
[01:02:16.136 --> 01:02:21.960]  I mean, that is a huge story, Tim Inlow and Chase Geyser and the rest of the crew broke down there.
[01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:22.580]  It's a great job.
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:27.203]  But here's one of these reports on Biden being in deep trouble.
[01:02:28.106 --> 01:02:35.929]  Begin with our brand new NBC News poll, which brings more warning signs for President Biden and his re-election campaign.
[01:02:36.569 --> 01:02:41.751]  One of our pollsters tells us we are looking at a, quote, presidency in peril.
[01:02:42.291 --> 01:02:51.374]  With the general election just nine months away, President Biden has declined on every measure since 2020, is struggling with key elements of his base,
[01:02:51.954 --> 01:02:59.296]  And now trails former President Donald Trump by wide margins on the issues voters say are most important to them.
[01:02:59.956 --> 01:03:05.918]  Joining me now to take us through the numbers is national political correspondent Steve Kornacki.
[01:03:05.958 --> 01:03:08.859]  Steve, these are some truly stunning numbers.
[01:03:09.059 --> 01:03:10.059]  They really are, Kristen.
[01:03:10.099 --> 01:03:11.560]  And let's just start with the bottom line.
[01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:19.363]  When you ask folks, hey, if it's the general election and it's Trump versus Biden, in our poll, Donald Trump now leads Joe Biden by five points.
[01:03:19.403 --> 01:03:22.264]  Compare that to the last time we polled back in November.
[01:03:22.324 --> 01:03:25.065]  Trump was ahead then, but it was only by two points.
[01:03:25.565 --> 01:03:27.926]  It's even more significant when you look at it this way.
[01:03:28.106 --> 01:03:33.708]  Over time, we have been testing for five years now, going back to 2019, a Biden-Trump matchup.
[01:03:33.728 --> 01:03:34.549]  Remember, 2019, 2020, Joe Biden led.
[01:03:34.569 --> 01:03:35.629]  He led big in everything.
[01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:50.116]  Every single one of our polls, for the first time in November, Donald Trump polled ahead in our poll, and now at five points, this is the biggest lead NBC has ever had in 16 polls for Donald Trump over Joe Biden.
[01:03:50.136 --> 01:03:54.739]  And of course, undergirding all of this is this question of, he is the incumbent Joe Biden.
[01:03:54.979 --> 01:03:56.780]  We ask voters, what do you think of the job he's doing?
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.681]  And look at that, Kristen, 37% approve, and now 60% disapprove.
[01:04:01.462 --> 01:04:08.407]  And we should say that is the lowest approval rating since former President George W. Bush's second term.
[01:04:08.647 --> 01:04:10.669]  Yeah, and put that in further context, too.
[01:04:10.729 --> 01:04:13.331]  Bush in his second term wasn't running for re-election.
[01:04:13.411 --> 01:04:17.694]  Here's the presidents who were running for re-election in our poll starting their re-election year.
[01:04:17.734 --> 01:04:18.895]  What was their approval rating?
[01:04:19.255 --> 01:04:19.916]  Bush was over 50.
[01:04:20.376 --> 01:04:20.796]  He won.
[01:04:20.856 --> 01:04:21.837]  Obama was almost at 50.
[01:04:22.318 --> 01:04:22.718]  He won.
[01:04:23.078 --> 01:04:24.259]  Trump, four years ago, was 46.
[01:04:24.839 --> 01:04:25.380]  He lost.
[01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:30.624]  Look how low Biden's number is compared to those predecessors at this point.
[01:04:30.664 --> 01:04:30.944]  Their number.
[01:04:31.804 --> 01:04:36.646]  It shows you the improvement Biden has to make here in the coming months.
[01:04:37.666 --> 01:04:56.692]  The issues that are driving this, too, the economy, no surprise we've been talking about it, but look at that advantage for Trump, 22 points, and securing the border here, folks, a very important Trump, with a 35... We'll be back.
[01:04:59.744 --> 01:05:03.866]  InfoWarsStore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.

[01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:14.410]  Down and out.
[01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:15.150]  What's better?
[01:05:15.210 --> 01:05:16.811]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[01:05:17.471 --> 01:05:22.413]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[01:05:23.098 --> 01:05:26.681]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[01:05:27.081 --> 01:05:28.382]  That's how our bodies work.
[01:05:28.402 --> 01:05:29.343]  They're all very diverse.
[01:05:29.703 --> 01:05:39.891]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWars MD Good Night Sleep.

[01:06:02.781 --> 01:06:09.044]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:11.123 --> 01:06:32.115]  We are now into hour number two of this live Sunday transmission.
[01:06:32.795 --> 01:06:35.377]  It's five o'clock and six minutes, 26 seconds.
[01:06:37.918 --> 01:06:39.819]  Alright, let's talk about positive news.
[01:06:40.499 --> 01:06:42.960]  20 years ago, 1% of people knew about the New World Order.
[01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:45.821]  Nobody knew about the Great Reset and their plans.
[01:06:46.761 --> 01:06:47.102]  We did.
[01:06:47.582 --> 01:06:48.122]  That's about it.
[01:06:48.142 --> 01:06:49.943]  A few other talk show hosts.
[01:06:51.103 --> 01:06:52.404]  Some of you listeners were informed.
[01:06:52.444 --> 01:06:53.024]  You were involved.
[01:06:53.384 --> 01:06:54.324]  Look how far we've come.
[01:06:54.384 --> 01:07:01.667]  So as negative as things are, because now we're inside the New World Order, we're not in Kansas anymore, at least we've got a fighting chance.
[01:07:02.127 --> 01:07:06.129]  There's a lot of these articles and a lot of these reports that I want to get to
[01:07:08.463 --> 01:07:08.904]  We're good to go.
[01:07:33.513 --> 01:07:33.933]  We're good to go.
[01:08:02.415 --> 01:08:03.535]  It's like a 10-year-old clip.
[01:08:03.695 --> 01:08:05.296]  They've had similar shows here in the U.S.
[01:08:05.336 --> 01:08:06.076]  It was in the Netherlands.
[01:08:06.096 --> 01:08:07.357]  It was a Down syndrome man.
[01:08:08.477 --> 01:08:11.218]  He was a really high-functioning and smart person.
[01:08:12.939 --> 01:08:14.740]  Or somebody cognitively quote with Down syndrome.
[01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:22.223]  And they're sitting there telling him, well, you cost three times more than the average Dutch citizen in our socialized system.
[01:08:22.243 --> 01:08:24.924]  So you think socialism is protecting the weak people, but they're not.
[01:08:24.944 --> 01:08:29.385]  They're kicking the old people out of nursing homes, out of their government housing, veterans out of the housing.
[01:08:29.425 --> 01:08:30.886]  Same thing in Europe for the illegal aliens.
[01:08:32.056 --> 01:08:32.556]  We're good to go.
[01:08:32.576 --> 01:08:33.056]  We're good to go.
[01:09:02.924 --> 01:09:09.007]  Globally prepared, globally directed evil to sell the medical system on killing people.
[01:09:10.468 --> 01:09:23.735]  So Trudeau's come out with TV ads and Hollywood productions and how wonderful it is to be killed, and you have all these wards of the state, children and adults, that are mentally ill, that are schizophrenic, that are brain damaged, out of their minds.
[01:09:24.875 --> 01:09:26.816]  Well, you're not a productive member of society.
[01:09:27.476 --> 01:09:28.397]  We're going to kill you.
[01:09:30.899 --> 01:09:42.525]  Because you see, you can say, oh, I'm 75, I've got bone cancer, I'm in incredible pain, I don't want to spend all my money and my family's money on trying to live.
[01:09:42.545 --> 01:09:45.067]  I want to commit suicide.
[01:09:46.508 --> 01:09:50.089]  And people that push that would say, hey, I'm an adult.
[01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:50.889]  It's my right.
[01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:55.931]  And listen, I don't want to legalize suicide because it leads to government push suicide and forced euthanasia.
[01:09:56.271 --> 01:09:58.051]  But I'm not going to sit there and judge somebody.
[01:09:58.111 --> 01:10:04.093]  If you're in incredible pain, you've been fighting cancer for two years, and you take a bunch of pain pills and drink a bottle of vodka.
[01:10:05.753 --> 01:10:08.054]  I mean, I'm not going to be, but that's your choice.
[01:10:08.434 --> 01:10:09.274]  That's between you and God.
[01:10:10.554 --> 01:10:12.115]  Is it really a moral sin to commit suicide?
[01:10:12.255 --> 01:10:12.655]  I don't know.
[01:10:14.659 --> 01:10:16.540]  I could never imagine committing suicide.
[01:10:17.381 --> 01:10:18.622]  And I would never do it.
[01:10:19.102 --> 01:10:20.423]  But I've not been in that position yet.
[01:10:21.204 --> 01:10:22.244]  So I'm not judging people.
[01:10:22.905 --> 01:10:24.666]  But they act like it's this right to die.
[01:10:27.308 --> 01:10:37.615]  But Jack Kevorkian admitted in his writings he was into death and loved killing people and painted all these weird paintings of babies coming out of women's vaginas and demons eating babies.
[01:10:37.936 --> 01:10:39.997]  Type in the art of Jack Kevorkian.
[01:10:40.037 --> 01:10:42.359]  It's almost all demons and devils eating children.
[01:10:43.902 --> 01:10:48.604]  So he was held up there as kind of this Greta Thunberg, this angel, this wonderful person.
[01:10:48.924 --> 01:10:50.485]  But really, he was part of a cult of death.
[01:10:51.245 --> 01:10:54.487]  But then in Canada, in the last few years, you've seen it.
[01:10:55.447 --> 01:10:57.408]  I almost feel bad not doing a whole show on it.
[01:10:57.428 --> 01:10:58.068]  In fact, we should.
[01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:06.072]  They said, we're going to kill people that are depressed.
[01:11:06.612 --> 01:11:08.173]  We're going to kill people that are brain damaged.
[01:11:08.193 --> 01:11:10.294]  We're going to kill people that have Down syndrome.
[01:11:10.314 --> 01:11:12.095]  We're going to kill people...
[01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:15.792]  That are schizophrenic because we're the wards.
[01:11:17.533 --> 01:11:18.734]  They don't have their rights.
[01:11:18.814 --> 01:11:20.495]  Their guardian is the government.
[01:11:21.016 --> 01:11:22.857]  So the government is the guardian.
[01:11:23.878 --> 01:11:29.162]  The government, like you're taking care of your mom or dad, they're 90 years old, nursing home, you're their guardian.
[01:11:31.144 --> 01:11:32.985]  Now, could you decide to have them killed?
[01:11:33.045 --> 01:11:34.106]  No, you couldn't, and you shouldn't.
[01:11:35.927 --> 01:11:37.208]  There's some Jack Kevorkian art.
[01:11:39.250 --> 01:11:40.371]  You can't make this up, folks.
[01:11:40.391 --> 01:11:43.193]  It's like a devil and a bunch of schizophrenics.
[01:11:44.696 --> 01:11:45.516]  Scroll through it.
[01:11:45.636 --> 01:11:49.318]  I mean, it's babies coming out, demons eating babies.
[01:11:49.598 --> 01:11:52.319]  Type in Jack Kevorkian art, demons eating babies.
[01:11:53.619 --> 01:11:54.499]  You can't make this up.
[01:11:54.579 --> 01:11:57.300]  So what's happening here?
[01:12:00.041 --> 01:12:10.005]  Well, if we'll kill the unborn and then now a bunch of states pass laws to kill them after they're born, remember the governor of Virginia saying when we make the decision to kill the baby after it's born.
[01:12:12.054 --> 01:12:17.698]  Now the state comes in and says, we are the wards, we are the chaperones, we have the power of attorney.
[01:12:18.558 --> 01:12:19.199]  What's the term?
[01:12:19.559 --> 01:12:21.480]  We'll pop my head in a minute.
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:22.441]  I'm teleprompter free here.
[01:12:22.921 --> 01:12:23.942]  It's such a simple term.
[01:12:26.344 --> 01:12:27.044]  We're their guardians.
[01:12:28.325 --> 01:12:29.626]  We control them.
[01:12:30.547 --> 01:12:31.908]  They have been found incompetent.
[01:12:33.148 --> 01:12:33.509]  There it is.
[01:12:34.169 --> 01:12:36.271]  They have been found incompetent by the state.
[01:12:37.231 --> 01:12:38.512]  The state's taking care of them.
[01:12:38.772 --> 01:12:40.694]  And you can sit back cold-bloodedly and say, fine.
[01:12:41.536 --> 01:12:43.657]  Kill that autistic kid.
[01:12:43.817 --> 01:12:45.717]  Kill that Down syndrome 20-year-old.
[01:12:46.598 --> 01:12:47.698]  Kill that depressed person.
[01:12:47.718 --> 01:12:48.378]  What do they contribute?
[01:12:48.398 --> 01:12:51.600]  Do you feel safe?
[01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:53.360]  Do you think God likes that?
[01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:54.721]  But you don't want to do that.
[01:12:55.041 --> 01:13:00.083]  But the state, the loving liberals do because this person is under their control.
[01:13:01.903 --> 01:13:03.164]  They have the power of attorney.
[01:13:03.404 --> 01:13:04.924]  They've been declared incompetent.
[01:13:04.964 --> 01:13:06.745]  The state is their guardian.
[01:13:08.976 --> 01:13:20.365]  And so, they announced two years ago, starting last year, that they were going to start killing at least 10,000 people a year in Canada as this globalist test.
[01:13:21.806 --> 01:13:22.467]  You can type it in.
[01:13:22.747 --> 01:13:26.110]  Canada now the test case for government for skithanasia.
[01:13:28.412 --> 01:13:30.894]  And they did a survey of the entire country.
[01:13:30.914 --> 01:13:31.715]  The article's right here.
[01:13:32.435 --> 01:13:35.738]  And they could not find one doctor...
[01:13:41.857 --> 01:13:48.005]  That would say, we're their guardian, and we're going to decide to kill them?
[01:13:48.485 --> 01:13:50.347]  It's one thing if we can convince somebody.
[01:13:51.449 --> 01:13:53.631]  I just agreed to commit suicide in a year or two.
[01:13:53.952 --> 01:13:55.053]  We'll give you a lot of freebies.
[01:13:55.073 --> 01:13:56.435]  You can go on a trip and see your mom.
[01:13:56.595 --> 01:13:57.276]  That's what they tell them.
[01:13:58.137 --> 01:14:01.000]  It's in Germany, it's in France, it's in England, it's in the U.S.
[01:14:02.284 --> 01:14:14.015]  And they come to him, and nurses have talked about it, doctors have, the patients have, they're like, listen, I was in a car wreck, my back's shattered, I just want this fixed, I don't want to kill myself, but they keep guilting me and saying I can't get welfare anymore.
[01:14:14.455 --> 01:14:16.677]  Oh, but there's all this welfare for the illegal aliens.
[01:14:18.218 --> 01:14:20.661]  There's all this money, $200 billion for Ukraine.
[01:14:22.264 --> 01:14:26.427]  They want the precedent for the state to decide who's essential and who isn't.
[01:14:26.668 --> 01:14:28.189]  You saw that during the COVID garbage.
[01:14:28.749 --> 01:14:31.151]  Oh, you're in the media, you're essential.
[01:14:31.211 --> 01:14:33.153]  Or oh, you're a cop, you're essential.
[01:14:33.193 --> 01:14:34.594]  Or you're a bureaucrat, you're essential.
[01:14:37.056 --> 01:14:39.198]  But oh, you're somebody else, you're not essential.
[01:14:39.638 --> 01:14:41.980]  They're telling you you're non-essential.
[01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:42.901]  You don't matter.
[01:14:42.981 --> 01:14:43.681]  You don't exist.
[01:14:43.701 --> 01:14:44.302]  You don't have value.
[01:14:44.822 --> 01:14:49.066]  So they couldn't find anybody in Canada...
[01:14:52.006 --> 01:15:00.890]  Even all their leftists, when the rubber met the road, they said, I'm not going to kill kids.
[01:15:04.492 --> 01:15:05.773]  We're not going to go along with this.
[01:15:07.794 --> 01:15:08.834]  We're not going to be part of this.
[01:15:11.516 --> 01:15:20.220]  And as big as the euthanasia and government forced death and government forced suicide, which is an oxymoron, it's government murder,
[01:15:21.451 --> 01:15:22.091]  It's genocide.
[01:15:22.111 --> 01:15:22.572]  It's Hitler.
[01:15:24.753 --> 01:15:27.254]  As big as that is, it's only a microcosm.
[01:15:29.795 --> 01:15:32.917]  Just refuse pedophile drag queen time.
[01:15:33.417 --> 01:15:34.958]  Just refuse the open borders.
[01:15:35.418 --> 01:15:36.779]  Just refuse Hollywood.
[01:15:37.039 --> 01:15:44.643]  Just refuse anything they push and just say no and speak out against it and don't comply and get in the face of people and it'll go away!
[01:15:46.892 --> 01:15:47.332]  We're good to go.
[01:16:17.671 --> 01:16:18.912]  And it's pods.
[01:16:19.872 --> 01:16:31.837]  Where you get in a pod, and the oxygen's sucked out, they chain you down, they're the wards, but now they can't get doctors to do it, so now they're going to have technicians do it.
[01:16:33.238 --> 01:16:39.681]  And they take you in a van to some place, you get chained down, they put you in a pod, and they suck the oxygen out.
[01:16:40.201 --> 01:16:41.382]  Now notice the left doesn't want...
[01:16:42.236 --> 01:16:45.499]  Capital punishment for child murderers and cop killers.
[01:16:45.539 --> 01:16:56.588]  But oh, they want it for the Down Syndrome person whose parents died, who's 35 years old, has a sweet soul, has friends, likes to go to the park and feed the ducks.
[01:16:56.928 --> 01:16:57.929]  We're going to kill him.
[01:17:00.271 --> 01:17:01.392]  Because we're his ward.
[01:17:03.134 --> 01:17:03.954]  We're his shepherd.
[01:17:04.815 --> 01:17:06.116]  Well, God's going to damn you to hell.
[01:17:06.176 --> 01:17:07.217]  Canada is now contracting for pods.
[01:17:11.963 --> 01:17:22.651]  Canada has frozen a plan to expand the assisted suicide program to include people suffering from mental illness so they can get mentally ill people to agree to this, or as their ward do it.
[01:17:22.971 --> 01:17:28.515]  Health Minister Mark Holland said and Justice Minister Afi Varani has announced.
[01:17:29.416 --> 01:17:38.363]  Among the reasons for the postponement, they cited a lack of medical professionals, especially psychiatrists, willing to evaluate patients before the lethal injection.
[01:17:40.117 --> 01:17:41.258]  But now I've gone into effect.
[01:18:10.208 --> 01:18:20.094]  Speaking to reporters on Monday following a session of a special parliamentary committee looking into the issue, Holland explained, it's clear from the conversation we've had the system is not ready.
[01:18:20.474 --> 01:18:22.015]  We need more time.
[01:18:23.624 --> 01:18:36.689]  On Thursday, Canada's health minister released a statement clarifying that the expansion originally slated for March 17th of this year, that's a month and a half away, of this year, had been postponed until 2027.
[01:18:37.169 --> 01:18:44.632]  It is hoped that by then, regional health care providers will be better prepared to administer euthanasia to the mentally ill, with clear guidelines developed.
[01:18:44.912 --> 01:18:46.393]  In the meantime, the document added...
[01:18:48.032 --> 01:18:56.660]  Canada is already among the countries with the most liberal laws regarding euthanasia and suicide with a procedure available to terminally ill and chronically ill people.
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:08.671]  However, plans to extend the practice to the mentally ill have proven controversial with members of the opposition conservative party accusing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau government of preparing a culture of death.
[01:19:10.717 --> 01:19:14.300]  Here's some of the TV ads they're running about how beautiful it is to kill yourself.
[01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:27.351]  They give you a big party, they make you a celebrity, and you get to go on a trip, you get to party for a few months, just like in Soylent Green in the early 1970s, a fictional vision of the future.
[01:19:27.671 --> 01:19:30.313]  Cue up our old Soylent Green three-minute piece, guys.
[01:19:31.034 --> 01:19:33.256]  It's got David Knight in it, and myself and Darren McBrain.
[01:19:34.821 --> 01:19:49.823]  In that, you get a great drug, and the actual, I guess the book is based on, I never read it, but I saw a synopsis, you get a big bonus for a year, and then you get given a great drug, and you see what the earth used to look like, and all this beautiful stuff they never show you anymore, and then they kill you.
[01:19:51.505 --> 01:19:53.387]  This is literally the plan.
[01:19:53.647 --> 01:20:04.537]  Because if we won't stand up for the Down Syndrome people and the unborn babies and the born babies and depressed people they're manipulating, then none of us are safe, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:06.258 --> 01:20:06.679]  None of us.
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:08.260]  None of us.
[01:20:09.401 --> 01:20:09.822]  None of us.
[01:20:10.802 --> 01:20:13.245]  I've got some other examples of positive things happening.
[01:20:13.265 --> 01:20:16.147]  You're like, God, how is it positive?
[01:20:16.167 --> 01:20:17.689]  We backed this off three, four years.
[01:20:19.138 --> 01:20:21.584]  Well, that's why they rebrand it and try to find more people to do it.
[01:20:21.624 --> 01:20:27.938]  And other articles bring in companies that are indemnified by the government, like the vaccine makers.
[01:20:28.239 --> 01:20:29.262]  Technicians do it.
[01:20:32.011 --> 01:20:34.192]  Yeah, Soylent Green's made out of us giving up our soul.
[01:20:34.512 --> 01:20:35.252]  It's made out of people.
[01:20:35.613 --> 01:20:36.833]  Here's this important piece.
[01:20:37.313 --> 01:20:38.214]  Guys found it really quick.
[01:20:38.274 --> 01:20:38.614]  Thank you.
[01:20:38.634 --> 01:20:44.456]  Because we don't really... I come in here, here's the clips, here's the articles, but half the time I'm like, pull this up, pull that up.
[01:20:44.796 --> 01:20:47.137]  And then I'm talking about stuff, they're typing it in.
[01:20:47.578 --> 01:20:49.018]  You can do the same thing the crew does.
[01:20:49.298 --> 01:20:53.400]  You can sit here and write notes of what I say and look it up for yourself.
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:57.922]  And then ask yourself, why would you want to be part of a death cult like this?
[01:20:58.242 --> 01:21:00.243]  Why would you want to give up on human humanity?
[01:21:01.175 --> 01:21:02.256]  We have unlimited resources.
[01:21:02.276 --> 01:21:04.780]  We have unlimited systems that we know in complex economies.
[01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:11.048]  The more we take care of old people and handicaps, the more powerful and successful we are and the bigger our civilization.
[01:21:12.165 --> 01:21:13.025]  So they do the inverse.
[01:21:13.105 --> 01:21:14.266]  Put homeless on drugs.
[01:21:14.606 --> 01:21:15.866]  Make it totally depressing.
[01:21:16.126 --> 01:21:16.826]  Bring in illegals.
[01:21:16.866 --> 01:21:17.807]  Let criminals run wild.
[01:21:18.067 --> 01:21:20.587]  To make you think a social safety net is bad.
[01:21:21.147 --> 01:21:23.568]  To make you think being involved in helping others is bad.
[01:21:23.808 --> 01:21:25.949]  So you give up and say, fine, release a bioweapon.
[01:21:26.189 --> 01:21:27.049]  Kill the third world.
[01:21:27.349 --> 01:21:28.509]  Stop assaulting us with them.
[01:21:28.969 --> 01:21:33.151]  We can turn Africa and Latin America, it's already happening, Latin America, into jewels.
[01:21:33.451 --> 01:21:34.731]  You'll be wanting to move there.
[01:21:34.991 --> 01:21:36.191]  They won't be able to move here.
[01:21:36.832 --> 01:21:38.432]  We can empower these people.
[01:21:38.712 --> 01:21:40.032]  We can do unlimited things.
[01:21:40.092 --> 01:21:41.513]  That's what God wants us to do.
[01:21:42.708 --> 01:21:46.593]  But we can't give the leftists guilt and say we're bad because we're Christian or we're white or whatever.
[01:21:46.913 --> 01:21:53.241]  We have to recognize that the globalists are manipulating that to create an anti-human system against everybody, no matter what color you are.
[01:21:53.802 --> 01:21:54.903]  We've broken their code.
[01:21:55.184 --> 01:21:56.225]  We know their operation.
[01:21:56.465 --> 01:21:57.406]  We know how to defeat them.
[01:21:57.627 --> 01:21:58.848]  I've got more positive news.
[01:21:59.629 --> 01:22:01.652]  I'll get to it in a moment, but here's that piece I talked about.
[01:22:08.826 --> 01:22:14.309]  Aborted babies incinerated to heat UK hospitals.
[01:22:14.349 --> 01:22:18.291]  Soylent Green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of people.
[01:22:18.511 --> 01:22:24.735]  But now children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals in the UK.
[01:22:24.775 --> 01:22:29.617]  They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[01:22:29.818 --> 01:22:34.320]  What is the secret of Soylent Green?
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:36.802]  The powdered flesh from dead babies.
[01:22:37.283 --> 01:22:39.465]  Some people believe they can cure disease.
[01:22:39.926 --> 01:22:44.050]  Because of its enormous popularity, Soylent Green is in short supply.
[01:22:44.770 --> 01:22:47.473]  Remember, Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.
[01:22:47.773 --> 01:22:50.656]  The supply of Soylent Green has been exhausted.
[01:22:51.017 --> 01:22:53.079]  You must evacuate the area immediately.
[01:22:55.589 --> 01:23:07.499]  The federal court ruled that the shareholders of PepsiCo, a big Bilderberg Group company, are not allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for in the flavoring, but we already know.
[01:23:08.139 --> 01:23:10.081]  So enjoy the flavor.
[01:23:10.121 --> 01:23:14.584]  We're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death panels and sales taxes.
[01:23:14.744 --> 01:23:16.286]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[01:23:16.746 --> 01:23:18.247]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[01:23:18.608 --> 01:23:19.849]  I'm for regular suicide.
[01:23:19.929 --> 01:23:21.530]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:33.120]  Is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient, would it be better not to lay off those ten teachers and to make that trade-off in medical costs?
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:37.323]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[01:23:37.543 --> 01:23:43.909]  They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:54.242]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[01:23:54.662 --> 01:23:59.085]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens.
[01:23:59.546 --> 01:24:01.327]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[01:24:02.048 --> 01:24:10.814]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison guards, on the quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[01:24:11.435 --> 01:24:13.917]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[01:24:14.594 --> 01:24:15.995]  The scoops are on their way.
[01:24:16.716 --> 01:24:18.238]  The scoops are on their way.
[01:24:19.359 --> 01:24:21.841]  I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[01:24:22.462 --> 01:24:25.284]  You will find out why Soylent Green means life.
[01:24:25.745 --> 01:24:28.788]  You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[01:24:28.808 --> 01:24:30.209]  We've got to stop them!
[01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:35.434]  That is the secret of Soylent Green.
[01:24:35.954 --> 01:24:37.776]  Soylent Green is people!
[01:24:51.894 --> 01:24:54.174]  And again, there's all these arguments for this you can have.
[01:24:55.275 --> 01:24:57.435]  And they do this in high schools and colleges.
[01:24:57.475 --> 01:24:59.296]  They do the spaceship game, the life raft.
[01:24:59.316 --> 01:25:02.837]  Oh, there's only enough food and water in the life raft for five people, but there's ten people.
[01:25:03.197 --> 01:25:04.598]  Who do we decide lives, who dies?
[01:25:05.098 --> 01:25:08.639]  And once they get you in that mindset, you decide to have a non-zero-sum game.
[01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:11.700]  Or a zero-sum game.
[01:25:12.970 --> 01:25:16.291]  Not a win-win situation, but how do I hurt somebody else in your head?
[01:25:16.671 --> 01:25:19.512]  And then once they cut you out and you're like, well, let's get rid of those non-essentials.
[01:25:19.532 --> 01:25:21.533]  Let's get rid of those Down syndrome children.
[01:25:22.253 --> 01:25:22.853]  Let's get rid of them.
[01:25:24.254 --> 01:25:32.036]  Once they've gotten you to do that and they can replace you with robots, but they'll get you later, you don't stand up for yourself.
[01:25:32.136 --> 01:25:33.417]  You don't stand up for other people.
[01:25:35.618 --> 01:25:36.719]  It's a zero-sum game.
[01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:41.783]  There's only so many pieces of the pie, and now you'll be all alone when they come for you.
[01:25:42.304 --> 01:25:44.546]  This is a seduction they're engaged in.
[01:25:45.206 --> 01:25:46.087]  And I see the globals.
[01:25:46.107 --> 01:25:46.948]  They've stolen the money.
[01:25:47.268 --> 01:25:48.169]  They've got all the power.
[01:25:48.549 --> 01:25:49.890]  All these new technologies are coming out.
[01:25:49.930 --> 01:25:50.691]  They want to live forever.
[01:25:51.031 --> 01:25:52.052]  They see billions of people.
[01:25:52.092 --> 01:25:52.893]  They don't want to manage it.
[01:25:52.913 --> 01:25:53.653]  They don't want to deal with it.
[01:25:54.034 --> 01:26:02.521]  And they want to sell us that the Earth's ending, and we hate ourselves, and humans are bad, and climate change, and just hope we just say, okay, we'll do whatever you say.
[01:26:02.801 --> 01:26:03.742]  Just euthanize us.
[01:26:05.759 --> 01:26:08.101]  They're turning off your life force.
[01:26:08.381 --> 01:26:12.884]  They're turning off your will to survive and they're getting you to sign on to their death cult.
[01:26:14.485 --> 01:26:15.186]  And that's what this is.
[01:26:17.007 --> 01:26:25.973]  I'm going to put that report out tomorrow on X. But I'm going to shoot a little outro too and just point out we cut that probably 12, 13 years ago.
[01:26:25.993 --> 01:26:30.136]  And I'm just going to come out and say, where are we now?
[01:26:31.377 --> 01:26:33.279]  And I'd like to see other people online
[01:26:34.298 --> 01:26:34.799]  We're good to go.
[01:26:50.376 --> 01:26:56.458]  Behind Christ, behind love, and behind justice, we transcend what color we are and we beat this.
[01:26:56.678 --> 01:27:00.260]  But that doesn't mean the left says transcend color and do whatever we say.
[01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:04.641]  Open borders, euthanasia, drag queen pedophile, new world order.
[01:27:04.661 --> 01:27:08.423]  Because we all want to come together.
[01:27:08.463 --> 01:27:12.784]  We all actually want to take care of each other, but they manipulate that instinct and say, well, then kill yourself.
[01:27:13.724 --> 01:27:14.185]  Roll over.
[01:27:14.565 --> 01:27:14.905]  Give up.
[01:27:16.098 --> 01:27:16.859]  We're fighting.
[01:27:16.879 --> 01:27:17.519]  What's a contender?
[01:27:41.926 --> 01:27:43.968]  Yeah, this person might win the boxing match.
[01:27:44.609 --> 01:27:47.311]  Yeah, they're up against the champion, but this guy's a contender.
[01:27:47.371 --> 01:27:48.332]  This lady's a contender.
[01:27:49.273 --> 01:27:51.495]  We are contenders for the future of humanity.
[01:27:51.915 --> 01:27:53.457]  And we're not just contenders now.
[01:27:54.017 --> 01:27:54.498]  We're now...
[01:27:56.934 --> 01:27:58.515]  In the position to win.
[01:27:59.235 --> 01:28:01.737]  And I'm not like these globalists that promise some utopia.
[01:28:02.077 --> 01:28:03.258]  But I promise you this.
[01:28:04.058 --> 01:28:13.603]  The system we're trying to set up together is not a dystopia by design of lies and fraud and deception and the lack of prosperity.
[01:28:14.984 --> 01:28:16.005]  The universe is big.
[01:28:16.365 --> 01:28:17.926]  This is an expansionist vision.
[01:28:18.666 --> 01:28:21.227]  This is a vision of us doing incredible things.
[01:28:21.548 --> 01:28:23.689]  But it's got to be done through rigged competition.
[01:28:24.545 --> 01:28:28.128]  And rugged individualism and a commitment to truth.
[01:28:29.189 --> 01:28:31.611]  And that's so much better than what the globalists are offering.
[01:28:32.811 --> 01:28:33.252]  Let me tell you.
[01:28:34.993 --> 01:28:38.095]  Bill Gates and his banana titties can burn in hell.
[01:28:38.856 --> 01:28:39.757]  And he's not my doctor.
[01:28:40.987 --> 01:28:41.587]  And he's our enemy.
[01:28:42.268 --> 01:28:43.049]  I know one thing.
[01:28:43.569 --> 01:28:49.093]  King Charles and the rest of his pedophile ilk, they're not fit to be toilet attendants.
[01:28:49.433 --> 01:28:50.454]  And so I know one thing.
[01:28:50.814 --> 01:28:53.917]  They shouldn't be in charge, and they're not going to be in charge much longer.
[01:28:54.337 --> 01:28:56.338]  We're identifying them, and they're going down.
[01:28:56.358 --> 01:28:56.799]  Stay with us.
[01:28:59.121 --> 01:29:00.381]  Bodies is back.
[01:29:00.522 --> 01:29:07.564]  The ultimate turmeric product on the market has returned to InfoWarsStore.com and is now 25% off for a limited time.
[01:29:07.924 --> 01:29:12.926]  Utilized for thousands of years, turmeric is one of the most studied medicinal herbs today.
[01:29:13.306 --> 01:29:20.949]  Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles are published every year on the chemistry and therapeutic potential of turmeric and its active components.
[01:29:21.269 --> 01:29:31.799]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body, help boost and support flexibility, increase mobility, assist in joint function, bolster your immune system, and so much more.
[01:29:32.159 --> 01:29:43.930]  Regular turmeric from the store contains about 1-5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids, but our super powerful extract using bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients in turmeric.
[01:29:44.150 --> 01:29:47.393]  No other product can compare with this curcuminoid delivery system.
[01:29:47.633 --> 01:29:51.256]  So if you want to put the true power of turmeric to the test, then look no further.
[01:29:51.476 --> 01:29:57.821]  Grab yourself a bottle today for 25% off at Infowarsstore.com and put your body at ease.
[01:29:59.202 --> 01:30:02.444]  If you ever take one piece of my advice...
[01:30:03.425 --> 01:30:04.626]  It's good a bottle of X2.
[01:30:05.387 --> 01:30:09.670]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:14.534]  We finally have a limited run back in supply at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:15.895 --> 01:30:18.637]  So many people have serious issues.
[01:30:18.937 --> 01:30:20.058]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[01:30:20.518 --> 01:30:25.942]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[01:30:26.463 --> 01:30:28.844]  Most of their iodine is bound to other heavy metals or...
[01:30:29.725 --> 01:30:31.867]  Bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[01:30:32.467 --> 01:30:37.471]  But this is pure atomic certified iodine.
[01:30:38.071 --> 01:30:41.154]  X2 is now back in stock, discounted.

[01:31:04.165 --> 01:31:05.265]  Winter is coming.
[01:31:06.306 --> 01:31:07.767]  Winter is coming.
[01:31:08.107 --> 01:31:09.488]  Winter isn't coming.
[01:31:10.089 --> 01:31:11.370]  Winter is here.

[01:31:58.712 --> 01:32:00.993]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[01:32:01.153 --> 01:32:01.494]  Thank you.
[01:32:01.694 --> 01:32:04.255]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[01:32:04.315 --> 01:32:05.596]  I started taking that stuff.
[01:32:05.616 --> 01:32:08.798]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[01:32:08.918 --> 01:32:09.819]  When did you start taking it?
[01:32:10.099 --> 01:32:14.082]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure, and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[01:32:14.142 --> 01:32:14.422]  Mm-hmm.
[01:32:14.702 --> 01:32:17.404]  And I started eating a little better, but my blood pressure stayed high.
[01:32:17.424 --> 01:32:24.949]  And when I took the X2 iodine after about two or four weeks, I think my body was detoxified of a bunch of metals and stuff that my body was storing.
[01:32:25.069 --> 01:32:27.271]  And my blood pressure came down to the perfect level.
[01:32:27.651 --> 01:32:30.593]  And I tell people the only thing I did was X2 iodine.
[01:32:30.953 --> 01:32:32.253]  I think we're good to go.
[01:33:00.669 --> 01:33:06.615]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:10.319 --> 01:33:15.405]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:22.589 --> 01:33:30.854]  Alright, tomorrow, Ezra Levant of Rebel Media, who's an expert on the euthanasia cult and the globalist testing ground that's Canada, will be joining us.
[01:33:30.894 --> 01:33:31.834]  But here's the bottom line.
[01:33:31.854 --> 01:33:33.115]  I've got a few other examples.
[01:33:33.135 --> 01:33:33.716]  There's so many.
[01:33:34.076 --> 01:33:34.916]  I'll cover it more tomorrow.
[01:33:34.936 --> 01:33:35.957]  I've got other news to hit here.
[01:33:37.518 --> 01:33:42.541]  But they confined no doctors, no psychiatrists to aid in killing mentally ill people in Canada.
[01:33:42.741 --> 01:33:44.382]  Now, you'd think they couldn't find anybody.
[01:33:45.002 --> 01:33:46.223]  But they sure tried.
[01:33:46.923 --> 01:33:48.204]  And now they're stopping the program.
[01:33:50.168 --> 01:33:51.429]  Let's just reject it all.
[01:33:51.529 --> 01:33:52.690]  Let's just say no.
[01:33:53.570 --> 01:33:55.612]  Oh, we're going to put men in girls sports.
[01:33:56.212 --> 01:33:59.875]  In martial arts?
[01:34:01.416 --> 01:34:08.221]  UFC hasn't done it, but they've got big martial arts international where a man gets in an arena and beats a woman to death.
[01:34:08.241 --> 01:34:11.063]  I mean, they've had cases where they've killed people.
[01:34:12.051 --> 01:34:13.613]  It's like, okay, well, he's allowed to.
[01:34:14.213 --> 01:34:19.278]  And then all the new top runners, all the top swimmers, they're murdering logic, people.
[01:34:19.879 --> 01:34:21.120]  Don't go to those events.
[01:34:21.420 --> 01:34:22.441]  Don't support those groups.
[01:34:22.461 --> 01:34:28.988]  You're like, well, why are these different affiliations and different organizations letting men compete in cycling against women?
[01:34:29.488 --> 01:34:30.209]  Or boxing?
[01:34:30.549 --> 01:34:31.230]  Or wrestling?
[01:34:31.530 --> 01:34:33.252]  Or mixed martial arts?
[01:34:34.533 --> 01:34:34.933]  Because...
[01:34:35.905 --> 01:34:36.645]  We're good to go.
[01:34:36.665 --> 01:34:36.925]  I think?
[01:35:02.756 --> 01:35:03.276]  We're good to go.
[01:35:33.677 --> 01:35:33.857]  I think?
[01:35:48.407 --> 01:35:49.027]  Boxing.
[01:35:49.788 --> 01:35:51.489]  We'll put up with anything.
[01:35:52.289 --> 01:35:56.172]  You know, it's the old saying, when I say jump, you better say how high.
[01:35:56.692 --> 01:36:03.316]  Well, if you sign up for the Marine Corps to go through boot camp, that's an admitted cult to get men ready to follow orders.
[01:36:03.916 --> 01:36:04.577]  So they tell you.
[01:36:05.964 --> 01:36:07.085]  Do ridiculous stuff.
[01:36:07.485 --> 01:36:08.526]  Say ridiculous things.
[01:36:09.246 --> 01:36:09.966]  That's a cult.
[01:36:10.367 --> 01:36:11.607]  I'm not saying it's a bad cult.
[01:36:11.888 --> 01:36:19.492]  It's a cult of war from thousands of years of training from different cultures to get men to charge into machine gun nest.
[01:36:20.573 --> 01:36:30.819]  They're using mind control way more hardcore in our children than they use on 20-year-old men that volunteer for the United States Marine Corps.
[01:36:36.894 --> 01:36:37.594]  Let that sink in.
[01:37:02.110 --> 01:37:07.855]  But if you're a transgender in the Marine Corps, it came out six months ago, you don't have to show up for formations, drills, events.
[01:37:08.175 --> 01:37:09.396]  You're just a man in a dress.
[01:37:10.917 --> 01:37:12.718]  Because they learned to moralize the Marine Corps.
[01:37:13.579 --> 01:37:17.722]  It's a sick cult coming in and taking over our American cult.
[01:37:19.304 --> 01:37:23.487]  Yeah, training men to charge machine gun nests takes some brainwashing.
[01:37:23.727 --> 01:37:24.788]  Let's admit that's what it is.
[01:37:26.570 --> 01:37:27.430]  You can say it's bad.
[01:37:27.490 --> 01:37:28.071]  Maybe it is.
[01:37:28.591 --> 01:37:29.572]  But it's our brainwashing.
[01:37:30.172 --> 01:37:30.633]  And it's men.
[01:37:32.725 --> 01:37:33.145]  We're good to go.
[01:38:00.558 --> 01:38:08.026]  They're torturing you to break you and make you weak so they control you, and that is sick beyond belief.
[01:38:08.727 --> 01:38:14.474]  And I reject every damn bit of that at every level of that.
[01:38:15.935 --> 01:38:21.281]  Now, look, I got like 15 examples of this, and I'll try to cover it more tomorrow because I got some other big positive news and some fun news I want to hit.
[01:38:23.595 --> 01:38:24.676]  But just look at this article.
[01:38:25.357 --> 01:38:26.318]  This is out of Red State.
[01:38:26.399 --> 01:38:29.202]  San Francisco school goes woke and pays the price.
[01:38:30.103 --> 01:38:31.485]  So the school was already failing.
[01:38:31.966 --> 01:38:35.030]  San Francisco funded it all over their school system.
[01:38:36.374 --> 01:38:44.517]  Instead of teaching reading, writing, and arithmetic, they taught that white people are inherently evil, read the article, and are inherently bad to mainly black and Hispanic classes.
[01:38:45.057 --> 01:38:49.879]  Now they went from 60% failure, look it up, to 90% failure, total failure.
[01:38:50.239 --> 01:38:51.139]  Well, that's the plan.
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:53.120]  All these kids know is they hate white people.
[01:38:53.860 --> 01:38:55.421]  But now the funding's being pulled.
[01:38:55.541 --> 01:38:56.601]  Everyone's leaving the schools.
[01:38:56.942 --> 01:38:58.262]  The blacks and Hispanics don't.
[01:38:58.322 --> 01:39:03.124]  They go, I want my kids to know how to read and write and get a job not to hate white people.
[01:39:05.250 --> 01:39:07.352]  People are saying I'm not going to euthanize little kids.
[01:39:08.793 --> 01:39:11.956]  I'm not going to send my kid to a drag queen story time with a convicted pedophile.
[01:39:13.478 --> 01:39:14.979]  I'm not going to euthanize little kids.
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:18.082]  People are just saying this is crazy.
[01:39:18.362 --> 01:39:22.806]  People are hitting bottom and they're saying I'm not part of this.
[01:39:23.687 --> 01:39:26.169]  I'm not going along with this.
[01:39:30.453 --> 01:39:30.994]  Here's another one.
[01:39:31.994 --> 01:39:36.297]  Louisiana man who was arrested for making jokes on Facebook now laughing all the way to the bank.
[01:39:36.617 --> 01:39:37.557]  They charged him.
[01:39:39.639 --> 01:39:40.859]  They had to drop the charges.
[01:39:41.039 --> 01:39:43.641]  He just joked and said, hey, they're arresting everybody that had another shot.
[01:39:44.181 --> 01:39:45.922]  Is the Sheriff's Department going to kill us next?
[01:39:46.443 --> 01:39:49.585]  They arrested him like we're in England and charged him.
[01:39:49.885 --> 01:39:53.527]  And then he fought back and didn't roll over and then is one of giant judgment.
[01:39:53.867 --> 01:39:54.448]  Another victory.
[01:39:54.508 --> 01:39:55.208]  And I got so many.
[01:39:57.049 --> 01:39:58.450]  I see hundreds of articles a week.
[01:39:58.470 --> 01:39:59.471]  I mean, I saw like 15 today.
[01:40:00.675 --> 01:40:02.136]  No one's buying EVs.
[01:40:02.916 --> 01:40:04.237]  The EV market's collapsing.
[01:40:04.257 --> 01:40:07.359]  I'm not against an electric vehicle, but they don't work in cold weather.
[01:40:07.619 --> 01:40:08.880]  They're way more expensive.
[01:40:09.541 --> 01:40:10.921]  It's a scam overall.
[01:40:12.062 --> 01:40:13.363]  And people are rejecting that.
[01:40:13.703 --> 01:40:16.945]  The power of your choice is changing the world.
[01:40:16.985 --> 01:40:17.505]  Here's another one.
[01:40:17.906 --> 01:40:25.210]  Slovakia Prime Minister orders investigation into COVID-19 response and vaccines over 21,000 excess deaths since 2020.
[01:40:25.350 --> 01:40:29.493]  And it's incredible investigations in Scotland.
[01:40:30.908 --> 01:40:32.929]  In Australia and in Germany.
[01:40:33.309 --> 01:40:35.349]  My point is, it's happening.
[01:40:36.149 --> 01:40:41.351]  And then we've got all these cases of athletes and others having heart attacks out of the shots.
[01:40:41.731 --> 01:40:43.291]  People are rejecting this.
[01:40:43.731 --> 01:40:45.071]  People are saying no.
[01:40:45.552 --> 01:40:55.654]  People, despite all the political correctness and all the pressure, are saying, we see through this and we are not bowing down to this anymore.
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:40:59.200]  All right, let me talk about this now.
[01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:00.701]  I already mentioned this earlier.
[01:41:00.741 --> 01:41:02.841]  I played some of the newscasts, but this is a big deal.
[01:41:03.862 --> 01:41:06.642]  And I'm going to just condense it and then cover the new news.
[01:41:08.563 --> 01:41:11.203]  The methodology of modern polling is gaslighting.
[01:41:11.804 --> 01:41:13.484]  Push polling, there's a lot of different systems.
[01:41:15.065 --> 01:41:20.366]  But they'll call you up on the phone and rig the question, do you support Trump and white supremacism?
[01:41:22.196 --> 01:41:24.057]  They won't ask, who are you voting for for president?
[01:41:24.077 --> 01:41:28.799]  They'll say, do you support Biden helping black people, or do you support white supremacism that Trump's been connected to?
[01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:31.200]  That's one of the ways they manipulate the question.
[01:41:31.601 --> 01:41:40.485]  Or they just sample 15% more or more of Democrats than Republicans, knowing they're going to say, I'm going to vote for Biden, and then that creates the illusion.
[01:41:41.598 --> 01:41:42.639]  We're good to go.
[01:41:42.659 --> 01:41:43.380]  We're good to go.
[01:42:04.969 --> 01:42:11.594]  Biden's now trailing Trump by 20 points on economy as approval rating plunges, NBC poll shows.
[01:42:12.835 --> 01:42:13.456]  We'll go to break.
[01:42:14.997 --> 01:42:21.762]  We'll come back and talk about how they plan to grab victory from the jaws of defeat straight ahead.
[01:42:21.782 --> 01:42:24.484]  And then I got some fun stuff I'm going to hit.
[01:42:26.366 --> 01:42:30.209]  I'm going to tie Taylor Swift into Donald Trump.
[01:42:31.505 --> 01:42:36.430]  Into Elvis Presley, into Adolf Hitler, into Alex Jones.
[01:42:37.030 --> 01:42:37.591]  Did you hear that?
[01:42:39.333 --> 01:42:48.942]  I'm going to tie the election and Joe Biden and Taylor Swift into Trump, into Biden, into Elvis Presley, into Hitler.
[01:42:50.883 --> 01:42:51.324]  It's fun.
[01:42:52.625 --> 01:42:54.206]  And Tucker in Moscow.
[01:42:55.007 --> 01:42:55.448]  Stay with us.
[01:42:58.908 --> 01:43:01.449]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalists.
[01:43:01.829 --> 01:43:04.170]  And people can't identify who's a patriot and who isn't.
[01:43:04.510 --> 01:43:07.652]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalists.
[01:43:07.712 --> 01:43:10.613]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.
[01:43:10.853 --> 01:43:21.458]  That's why I designed this amazing 1776 red, white, and blue Gadsden flag shirt so you can support the Infowar and meet like-minded people everywhere when you wear it.
[01:43:21.578 --> 01:43:27.183]  When you wear these shirts, it creates an amazing amount of energy and it's quite the adventure.

[01:43:59.679 --> 01:44:11.513]  We are in the middle of a crude and ugly communist revolution funded by the big banks as a battering ram into a new age digital economy and a total surveillance state.
[01:44:11.953 --> 01:44:19.962]  All branches of government are attacking we the people and they offer us only one option a meaningless vote in a rigged election.
[01:44:20.843 --> 01:44:21.684]  We're good to go.
[01:44:21.704 --> 01:44:21.924]  I think?

[01:45:58.697 --> 01:46:05.280]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the global agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:19.487]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections, masquerading as vaccines.
[01:46:19.667 --> 01:46:24.570]  It is so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives oblivious.
[01:46:25.970 --> 01:46:27.694]  And he realized Ingrid's not blessed.
[01:46:27.914 --> 01:46:28.655]  It equals death.
[01:46:30.307 --> 01:46:50.735]  But people are starting to really understand how serious things are, and that's a hard thing to do, because to wake up to a disturbing reality and realize that we're in the middle of a giant biological weapons war against humanity, and that there's mass sterilization that's already taking place, cutting off all the major energy sources, is really hard to deal with, but it's the reality.
[01:46:51.295 --> 01:46:55.476]  Facing it is our only chance to turn this around, because stuff's about to get really, really nasty.
[01:46:55.877 --> 01:46:56.517]  Infowars.com.
[01:47:00.054 --> 01:47:05.976]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:24.528 --> 01:47:27.190]  All right, final segment in this hour.
[01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:28.791]  Chase Geiser back from the border.
[01:47:29.252 --> 01:47:31.013]  Loaded for Bear, 6 to 8 p.m.
[01:47:31.474 --> 01:47:32.154]  Sunday live.
[01:47:32.214 --> 01:47:32.715]  Coming up now.
[01:47:32.835 --> 01:47:33.535]  Please watch it.
[01:47:33.916 --> 01:47:35.797]  Please repost it on X. Get it everywhere.
[01:47:36.297 --> 01:47:38.940]  He is an amazing patriot, and this is an info war.
[01:47:39.460 --> 01:47:41.141]  And you are the dog.
[01:47:41.201 --> 01:47:41.842]  We're the tail.
[01:47:42.202 --> 01:47:43.923]  So get this link out.
[01:47:44.304 --> 01:47:45.945]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:47:46.425 --> 01:47:48.167]  And real Alex Jones on X. Okay.
[01:47:49.619 --> 01:47:54.520]  Look, I'm no rocket scientist, but I also wasn't born just yesterday.
[01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:55.840]  I didn't fall off a turnip truck.
[01:47:57.180 --> 01:47:59.401]  As they say, I was born in the dark, but it wasn't last night.
[01:48:00.261 --> 01:48:06.222]  And so a few months ago, I went on air a couple times, and I said, listen, Taylor Swift is owned by George Soros.
[01:48:06.782 --> 01:48:08.002]  He bought her catalog.
[01:48:08.062 --> 01:48:08.883]  He controls her.
[01:48:10.243 --> 01:48:15.744]  She's a political operative, and she's a young, beautiful woman, and Biden's this old, creepy devil.
[01:48:17.250 --> 01:48:23.113]  And if they can exacerbate the media, there's this fight between conservatives and Taylor Swift, which wasn't going on.
[01:48:23.133 --> 01:48:31.677]  And conservatives, because they get a lot of traffic and a lot of coverage by the media, start covering it.
[01:48:33.677 --> 01:48:34.998]  It's like those famous memes.
[01:48:35.078 --> 01:48:41.101]  I should have told the crew to do it, but we can do it and post later and post it to Infowars.com and Bandai Video, where you've got
[01:48:42.205 --> 01:48:46.126]  Raiders of the Lost Ark and that first scene with Indiana Jones.
[01:48:46.206 --> 01:48:47.487]  And he's there in the temple.
[01:48:47.507 --> 01:48:49.828]  He's got the bag of sand and the gold idol.
[01:48:50.268 --> 01:48:54.669]  And he wants to shift the bag of sand that he'd read was the right weight to the idol.
[01:48:54.709 --> 01:48:55.690]  But it's not the right weight.
[01:48:55.730 --> 01:48:56.990]  The big boulders start coming in.
[01:48:57.550 --> 01:48:59.231]  Well, imagine there's Joe Biden right there.
[01:48:59.251 --> 01:49:01.071]  He's totally unpopular and losing everywhere.
[01:49:01.131 --> 01:49:03.692]  And everybody knows he's a puppet of Obama.
[01:49:04.152 --> 01:49:09.334]  But if they could shift Taylor Swift in to that position there.
[01:49:09.894 --> 01:49:11.355]  And, oh, this young, beautiful woman.
[01:49:12.608 --> 01:49:15.830]  Versus Trump, then the psyops there.
[01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:19.893]  And the Republicans have bought the lie.
[01:49:19.913 --> 01:49:21.414]  They've bought into the fraud.
[01:49:22.395 --> 01:49:24.536]  But they're starting to get that they've done it.
[01:49:25.877 --> 01:49:27.999]  And they're starting to understand, let's just leave Taylor Swift alone.
[01:49:28.973 --> 01:49:29.593]  Here's the headline.
[01:49:29.633 --> 01:49:37.256]  How the Biden regime is using the Taylor Swift op to foment a cultural color revolution to undermine the 2024 election.
[01:49:37.856 --> 01:49:39.437]  Great report out of Gateway Pundit.
[01:49:39.657 --> 01:49:40.017]  Read it.
[01:49:40.517 --> 01:49:42.798]  It kind of condenses what I've already said, but it's true.
[01:49:43.599 --> 01:49:44.419]  Just ignore her.
[01:49:45.159 --> 01:49:45.719]  Move on.
[01:49:46.140 --> 01:49:47.700]  They said, oh, Taylor Swift doesn't like you.
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:48.360]  Oh, Taylor Swift.
[01:49:48.581 --> 01:49:49.481]  Oh, yay, Taylor Swift.
[01:49:50.225 --> 01:49:52.146]  And all the young people here is, why don't you like Taylor Swift?
[01:49:52.387 --> 01:49:53.187]  She's super popular.
[01:49:53.427 --> 01:49:54.848]  She's the number one musician in the world right now.
[01:49:55.128 --> 01:49:56.049]  She's the Beatles today.
[01:49:56.409 --> 01:49:57.390]  She's owned by Soros.
[01:49:57.670 --> 01:49:58.651]  She's like Greta Thunberg.
[01:49:58.691 --> 01:50:00.893]  She's an actress.
[01:50:01.193 --> 01:50:02.173]  She does what she's told.
[01:50:02.554 --> 01:50:03.975]  Move on from her.
[01:50:04.675 --> 01:50:05.476]  Throw it in the trash.
[01:50:07.702 --> 01:50:13.326]  So Trump comes out to counter it and says, hey, people think I look like Elvis as a joke.
[01:50:13.706 --> 01:50:18.569]  He puts it on True Social, and Biden seizes on that and says, no, you're not Elvis.
[01:50:19.290 --> 01:50:23.533]  That's a really smart thing by Trump's PSYOP operation, which is not hurting people.
[01:50:23.593 --> 01:50:25.274]  It's using fun memes against the enemy.
[01:50:25.314 --> 01:50:25.894]  I know who they are.
[01:50:26.315 --> 01:50:27.355]  That was a really good move.
[01:50:28.876 --> 01:50:30.577]  So now, weirdest campaign ever.
[01:50:30.637 --> 01:50:34.120]  Trump leads Latinos, and Trump says...
[01:50:35.709 --> 01:50:36.869]  I look like Elvis.
[01:50:37.770 --> 01:50:41.351]  And Biden completely freaks out.
[01:50:42.511 --> 01:50:44.392]  And says, no, no, you don't look like Elvis.
[01:50:46.692 --> 01:50:48.433]  And Trump is kind of an Elvis character.
[01:50:48.513 --> 01:50:54.875]  Wild hair, wild flamboyant, super popular, amazing ladies' man.
[01:50:55.375 --> 01:50:55.815]  It's true.
[01:50:55.895 --> 01:50:57.676]  So this is a great psy-op.
[01:50:58.196 --> 01:51:00.797]  And the great news is the left's taking the bait immediately.
[01:51:01.057 --> 01:51:02.057]  They got Taylor Swift.
[01:51:02.357 --> 01:51:04.178]  We'll just resurrect Elvis Presley.
[01:51:04.977 --> 01:51:05.537]  We're good to go.
[01:51:05.558 --> 01:51:05.698]  I think?
[01:51:28.140 --> 01:51:30.682]  So, Trump knows exactly what he's doing.
[01:51:31.082 --> 01:51:32.723]  Then this comes out today.
[01:51:33.403 --> 01:51:34.924]  And I think it's really interesting.
[01:51:35.805 --> 01:51:37.806]  Because the most demonized person ever is Hitler.
[01:51:37.826 --> 01:51:38.706]  You know, I don't like Hitler.
[01:51:38.726 --> 01:51:39.467]  I thought he was bad.
[01:51:40.367 --> 01:51:47.131]  But that said, so many people that have been called Hitler don't even support Hitler's views.
[01:51:47.252 --> 01:51:50.834]  I've been called Hitler tens of thousands of times that I know of.
[01:51:50.894 --> 01:51:52.715]  I mean, so many times I didn't even get a track of it.
[01:51:53.395 --> 01:51:55.557]  So, folks used AI...
[01:51:57.813 --> 01:52:04.078]  To merge the faces of, first off, Elon Musk, Barack Obama.
[01:52:05.179 --> 01:52:08.282]  I'm starting up at the upper left-hand corner.
[01:52:08.662 --> 01:52:21.392]  Elon Musk, Barack Obama, the Daily Wires, Ben Shapiro, Vladimir Putin, King Charles.
[01:52:22.535 --> 01:52:25.958]  By the way, I posted this on X. It was a test.
[01:52:25.998 --> 01:52:29.981]  I made 100 on this because I didn't read the cheat sheet first.
[01:52:30.061 --> 01:52:30.782]  I said, well, that's clear.
[01:52:32.303 --> 01:52:34.565]  That's Elon Musk, number one.
[01:52:34.745 --> 01:52:36.566]  Number two is Barack Obama as Hitler.
[01:52:36.626 --> 01:52:38.107]  Number three is Ben Shapiro as Hitler.
[01:52:38.268 --> 01:52:40.429]  Number four is Vladimir Putin.
[01:52:41.530 --> 01:52:43.211]  Right there in the middle is King Charles.
[01:52:44.012 --> 01:52:44.973]  And who is that?
[01:52:45.813 --> 01:52:47.555]  Number six, who is that?
[01:52:48.295 --> 01:52:51.278]  And then you've got Benjamin Netanyahu,
[01:52:52.588 --> 01:52:55.149]  Then you got Biden, and then you got Trump.
[01:52:56.370 --> 01:53:01.393]  Now, people are completely freaking out right now, and they're doing this with AI.
[01:53:01.413 --> 01:53:03.554]  They're saying, who looks the most like Hitler?
[01:53:03.594 --> 01:53:10.798]  I don't want to look like Hitler, but the little joke was, my grandfather's almost completely German.
[01:53:10.818 --> 01:53:12.079]  He's dead, obviously, great guy.
[01:53:12.499 --> 01:53:15.441]  Didn't have black hair, had blonde hair, but his face looked like Hitler.
[01:53:15.481 --> 01:53:17.222]  Just a classic German face.
[01:53:18.103 --> 01:53:18.203]  And
[01:53:19.372 --> 01:53:29.196]  The point is that they merged my face with Hitler, and people thought, by the millions on X, that that was the real Hitler right there.
[01:53:29.236 --> 01:53:34.959]  No, that's Alex Jones' photo, but it matches the classic Hitler photo.
[01:53:35.359 --> 01:53:40.541]  So I'm going to introduce a new conspiracy theory here today for everybody.
[01:53:41.222 --> 01:53:43.603]  I'm not Bill Hicks, the comedian that died in 1993.
[01:53:43.803 --> 01:53:45.764]  That's been said everywhere.
[01:53:45.804 --> 01:53:47.224]  It's been in Rolling Stone magazine.
[01:53:47.244 --> 01:53:48.545]  It's been in the New York Times.
[01:53:49.969 --> 01:53:50.669]  I'm not Bill Hicks.
[01:53:51.730 --> 01:53:53.510]  But I am a clone of Adolf Hitler.
[01:53:54.571 --> 01:53:55.251]  It's true, folks.
[01:53:55.511 --> 01:53:56.331]  I am Adolf Hitler.
[01:53:57.632 --> 01:53:58.372]  The truth is out.
[01:53:58.952 --> 01:53:59.813]  It's been exposed.
[01:53:59.853 --> 01:54:00.853]  They've done the face scans.
[01:54:01.693 --> 01:54:03.194]  I am Adolf A. Lois Hitler.
[01:54:03.614 --> 01:54:06.495]  I'm a clone of Hitler on a Texas diet.
[01:54:07.375 --> 01:54:09.876]  Now, I'm being completely sarcastic, and that's satire.
[01:54:10.236 --> 01:54:12.117]  You'll see headlines everywhere tomorrow.
[01:54:12.177 --> 01:54:13.498]  Jones says he's a clone of Hitler.
[01:54:14.018 --> 01:54:16.599]  Just like I read Jonathan Swift's
[01:54:18.143 --> 01:54:20.024]  Modest proposal three years ago.
[01:54:21.624 --> 01:54:26.626]  And I said, if lockdowns continue and we cut off the third world's food, they're going to flood us.
[01:54:27.147 --> 01:54:35.590]  And if there's a road warrior scenario, the Pentagon says within 15 days, most people become cannibals, about 90%, 10% commit suicide.
[01:54:36.510 --> 01:54:37.871]  And I said, I'm not committing suicide.
[01:54:38.191 --> 01:54:39.812]  If society collapses, I'll eat my neighbors.
[01:54:39.872 --> 01:54:42.413]  But I said it was satire, but I was talking about a real issue.
[01:54:42.633 --> 01:54:43.513]  So no, I'm not Bill Hicks.
[01:54:43.593 --> 01:54:44.314]  I'm not Adolf Hitler.
[01:54:44.834 --> 01:54:46.114]  But the media doesn't care.
[01:54:46.134 --> 01:54:46.635]  They're liars.
[01:54:46.975 --> 01:54:47.355]  It's fine.
[01:54:48.237 --> 01:54:55.161]  They're going to say that Alex Jones says he's a clone of Adolf Hitler.
[01:54:55.801 --> 01:55:04.727]  And then now, all the different AI groups and all the different organizations, they're all going to start looking at my face and Hitler's face.
[01:55:06.007 --> 01:55:11.611]  And of course, in genetic similarities, there's so many similarities with anybody.
[01:55:12.491 --> 01:55:13.592]  And my mom's basically...
[01:55:15.165 --> 01:55:15.545]  90% German.
[01:55:16.165 --> 01:55:19.146]  And they're going to believe that I'm really the clone of that old Hitler.
[01:55:20.467 --> 01:55:29.629]  Because that's Alex Jones with a Hitler hair job and a Hitler mustache, and people thought, oh, they did a big test, millions of years.
[01:55:30.109 --> 01:55:31.150]  Oh, that's Hitler!
[01:55:33.070 --> 01:55:35.371]  Millions responded and said, that's Hitler.
[01:55:35.531 --> 01:55:36.591]  That's not Hitler, folks.
[01:55:36.831 --> 01:55:38.211]  That's Alex Jones with a Hitler haircut.
[01:55:38.692 --> 01:55:39.892]  But that's the craziness.
[01:55:40.072 --> 01:55:43.713]  I way more match Hitler than I match...
[01:55:47.534 --> 01:55:48.114]  We're good to go.
[01:56:09.898 --> 01:56:11.218]  Hicks is a Welsh name.
[01:56:11.519 --> 01:56:12.259]  He had dark hair.
[01:56:12.339 --> 01:56:12.699]  I don't.
[01:56:13.259 --> 01:56:14.980]  He looks like 90% like me.
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:20.021]  But in genetics, that's like, you get like a breed of German Shepherd.
[01:56:20.041 --> 01:56:21.002]  They all look exactly the same.
[01:56:22.202 --> 01:56:24.183]  But the point is, I don't even look that much like Hitler.
[01:56:24.503 --> 01:56:26.903]  But that's the mental illness that's out there.
[01:56:27.344 --> 01:56:31.885]  And people have to learn to decipher from that and see the truth.
[01:56:31.925 --> 01:56:38.167]  So the big question is, am I Bill Hicks or am I a clone of Adolf Hitler?
[01:56:39.226 --> 01:56:40.206]  That's the real question.
[01:56:40.386 --> 01:56:43.588]  That's why I wear the beard, folks, to have a different hairstyle.
[01:56:43.948 --> 01:56:47.469]  Because I am a clone of Hitler, not Bill Hicks.
[01:56:49.410 --> 01:56:51.151]  I am a CIA experiment.
[01:56:51.291 --> 01:56:58.174]  I am a genetic clone of Adolf Alois Hitler, folks, in a secret CIA project.
[01:56:59.575 --> 01:57:00.275]  There it is right there.
[01:57:01.587 --> 01:57:02.828]  No, none of that's true.
[01:57:03.108 --> 01:57:07.630]  And that's why AI is so dangerous and why people can't have common sense in their own research.
[01:57:07.990 --> 01:57:09.151]  They can fall for anything.
[01:57:09.411 --> 01:57:18.736]  But worse, the corporate media will run with this and say Alex Jones claims he is Adolf Alois Hitler.
[01:57:20.450 --> 01:57:22.291]  All right, we had some fun tonight.
[01:57:22.912 --> 01:57:26.895]  The point is, Trump's saying, no, Taylor Swift is Biden.
[01:57:27.176 --> 01:57:28.277]  I am Elvis.
[01:57:28.617 --> 01:57:29.618]  It's a beautiful move.
[01:57:29.918 --> 01:57:31.640]  Now the left's going, no, you're not Elvis.
[01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:33.621]  People think Elvis when they think Trump.
[01:57:34.943 --> 01:57:36.364]  Now they'll think Hitler when they think me.
[01:57:37.525 --> 01:57:39.387]  Well, Hitler's so popular now, I guess it's okay.
[01:57:39.767 --> 01:57:40.808]  But I still don't like Hitler.
[01:57:40.848 --> 01:57:41.689]  I think Hitler was bad.
[01:57:42.850 --> 01:57:44.391]  I think Ye was wrong.
[01:57:44.932 --> 01:57:46.233]  All right, Chase Geyser's coming up.
[01:57:50.799 --> 01:57:50.919]  So,
[01:58:14.019 --> 01:58:22.264]  Well, I'm glad you mentioned that because it's methylfolate, the breakdown of folic acid, and a lot of people, particularly Europeans, don't absorb all of the folic acid.
[01:58:22.504 --> 01:58:23.605]  So it's not a stimulant.
[01:58:23.825 --> 01:58:27.247]  It's a totally natural thing that boosts energy that's foundational.
[01:58:27.527 --> 01:58:30.088]  And was I lying to you or did it not work?
[01:58:30.769 --> 01:58:31.989]  No, it was top-notch.
[01:58:32.029 --> 01:58:35.651]  And I was actually taking Red Pill Plus before, and that's got a little folic acid in it.
[01:58:35.692 --> 01:58:39.494]  I think there was a little buildup from this, but the energy from this was no jitters.
[01:58:39.654 --> 01:58:40.574]  I mean, it's top-notch.
[01:58:40.594 --> 01:58:41.395]  It's a great product.
[01:58:41.823 --> 01:58:42.764]  Well, thank you so much.
[01:58:42.824 --> 01:58:43.104]  Yeah, no.
[01:58:43.244 --> 01:58:46.567]  Folic acid's great and it's in real red pill, but some can't break it down.
[01:58:46.607 --> 01:58:47.628]  This is the breakdown of it.
[01:58:47.688 --> 01:58:48.469]  That's exactly it.
[01:58:50.110 --> 01:59:01.920]  We are in the middle of a crude and ugly communist revolution funded by the big banks as a battering ram into a new age digital economy and a total surveillance state.
[01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:07.844]  All branches of government are attacking we the people and they offer us only one option.
[01:59:08.185 --> 01:59:10.387]  A meaningless vote in a rigged election.
[01:59:11.267 --> 01:59:12.128]  We're good to go.
[01:59:33.963 --> 01:59:37.544]  Share them, upload them, and send them everywhere.
[01:59:38.264 --> 01:59:41.885]  Let the world unite for truth, justice, and 1776 worldwide.
