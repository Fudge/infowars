[00:00:04.887 --> 00:00:15.434]  Larry Silverstein originally owned Building 7 and a few months before 9-11 he bought the entire complex, all seven of the buildings, and then he took out a record insurance policy on them.
[00:00:16.034 --> 00:00:28.242]  Building 7 and what happened to it is so important because the official story is two jets flew into the buildings, we all agree on that, and that their jet fuel caused the steel to melt and caused them to collapse.
[00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:36.426]  But then we look at Building 7, which was the furthest away of any of these buildings from Tower 1 and 2, and it wasn't even damaged.
[00:00:36.486 --> 00:00:38.226]  But later that afternoon, caught on fire.
[00:00:38.547 --> 00:00:40.547]  Now they've rebuilt Building 7.
[00:00:41.268 --> 00:00:42.568]  Here's Tower 1 and 2.
[00:00:42.688 --> 00:00:45.550]  Obviously, you all know those were hit by a jet aircraft.
[00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.331]  And then we have Building 7.
[00:00:48.735 --> 00:00:50.616]  The furthest away from all the other buildings.
[00:00:50.676 --> 00:00:53.238]  Building 7 was 47 stories tall.
[00:00:53.978 --> 00:00:55.819]  Building 7 was not hit by an aircraft.
[00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.541]  Building 7 did not catch fire from these buildings.
[00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:03.124]  But later in the afternoon, mysteriously, it caught on fire.
[00:01:04.127 --> 00:01:08.089]  And then after 4.30pm, the firefighters told everybody to get back.
[00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:12.770]  They were quote, going to pull the building, the demolition term, for demolishing one.
[00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.491]  They told Associated Press reporters, get back, we're going to pull it.
[00:01:15.932 --> 00:01:21.234]  And this building that wasn't hit by a plane, that had no damage to it, collapsed symmetrically.
[00:01:21.874 --> 00:01:24.735]  Building 7 was a block away, where my hand is.
[00:01:25.115 --> 00:01:30.359]   But the red flashing square is where Bankers Trust still stands today.
[00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.244]  It had Tower One fall onto it, but just had light damage.
[00:01:35.125 --> 00:01:41.191]  The owner Larry Silverstein of the entire complex got on TV and said that they had blown up Building 70.
[00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:42.252]  He said they pulled it.
[00:01:42.353 --> 00:01:42.873]  Demolition.
[00:01:43.093 --> 00:01:44.154]  Well, Silverstein owned them all.
[00:01:44.495 --> 00:01:45.716]  Oh, Silverstein owned all the buildings.
[00:01:46.117 --> 00:01:46.937]  How many buildings are gone?
[00:01:47.558 --> 00:01:48.099]  All of them.
[00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:50.140]  How many is that?
[00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:51.702]  That's right.
[00:01:51.782 --> 00:01:53.363]  That building wasn't hit by a plane.
[00:01:53.883 --> 00:01:55.185]  Nine buildings are gone.
[00:01:55.285 --> 00:01:56.946]  Thousands of people were attacked.
[00:01:57.286 --> 00:01:59.268]  And there's an official U.S.
[00:01:59.288 --> 00:02:01.109]  government plan to carry out the attacks.
[00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.971]  He admitted it.
[00:02:03.011 --> 00:02:04.252]  He said it on television.
[00:02:04.512 --> 00:02:07.635]  He broke that building down.
[00:02:07.755 --> 00:02:12.259]  Larry Silverstein on America Rebuilding on PBS said that they blew up Building 7.
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.640]  Even though... Hey, he saw it!
[00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.400]  Did you see it on PBS?
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.021]  Yeah, he pulled it.
[00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:19.221]  He said on PBS, he said, we pulled the building.
[00:02:19.421 --> 00:02:19.621]  PBS!
[00:02:19.641 --> 00:02:20.821]  Oh, yeah, he pulled the building.
[00:02:22.782 --> 00:02:31.223]  Pelted by debris when the North Tower collapsed, seven burned until late afternoon, allowing occupants to evacuate to safety.
[00:02:32.543 --> 00:02:38.704]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander, telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[00:02:38.724 --> 00:02:42.265]  I said, you know, we've had such terrible loss of life.
[00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:45.298]  Maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.
[00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:59.509]  And they made that decision to pull, and then we watched the building collapse.
[00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.430]  Yeah, he said we're gonna pull the building.
[00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.432]  Silverstein said we're gonna pull the building.
[00:03:03.452 --> 00:03:04.813]  We got the firemen saying they pulled it.
[00:03:05.233 --> 00:03:10.077]  I mean, Silverstein goes on PBS and says it, and we're the weirdos when he says it on TV.
[00:03:10.637 --> 00:03:11.637]  Unbelievable.
[00:03:11.637 --> 00:03:17.637]  It's amazing.
[00:03:17.637 --> 00:03:27.637]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:03:18.994 --> 00:03:21.076]  Amazing, incredible, pick your word.
[00:03:22.016 --> 00:03:32.843]  For the third time today, it's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[00:03:34.504 --> 00:03:40.809]  We have the owner of the World Trade Center complex admitting on tape that he ordered the building demolished on the afternoon of 9-11.
[00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.971]  I said, you know, we've had such terrible loss of life.
[00:03:45.066 --> 00:03:46.972]  Maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.
[00:03:48.176 --> 00:03:52.496]   and they made that decision to pull and then we watched the building collapse.
[00:03:52.496 --> 00:04:05.535]   During our on-the-ground investigations in New York City over the last five plus years,
[00:04:05.535 --> 00:04:10.176]   we've talked to scores of eyewitnesses who had claimed that police and firemen
[00:04:10.176 --> 00:04:15.936]   told them to get back from building seven because it was going to be brought down or "explode."
[00:04:16.127 --> 00:04:22.448]  Building 7, while I was listening to live feed from our local public radio station later in the afternoon, they talked about Building 7.
[00:04:22.648 --> 00:04:24.549]  Building 7 was fine.
[00:04:24.829 --> 00:04:26.229]  There was no airplane that hit it.
[00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:30.110]  And then they even began to ruminate on the air about demolishing the building.
[00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.370]  I said, well, I don't know.
[00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.711]  I mean, you can put out fires.
[00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:38.571]  Why would you talk about demolishing a building that wasn't hit by anything?
[00:04:39.092 --> 00:04:40.792]  The fires weren't bad or anything like that.
[00:04:41.423 --> 00:04:47.148]  I will say that I spoke to a cop on 9-11 who said that it was going to come down.
[00:04:47.428 --> 00:04:48.449]  I don't know how he knew that.
[00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.413]  It takes demolition experts weeks to prepare for the destruction of a building.
[00:04:53.774 --> 00:04:56.256]  How do they do it on 9-11 in just a few hours?
[00:04:58.237 --> 00:05:06.641]  In the tragic days after 9-11, many prominent engineers across the world went public and said, there's no way that fire destroyed any of those buildings.
[00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:08.622]  It's never happened to a modern building.
[00:05:08.962 --> 00:05:11.743]  Buildings have burned for six, seven days before and it hasn't happened.
[00:05:12.123 --> 00:05:13.944]  The answer was hidden in plain view.
[00:05:14.024 --> 00:05:17.586]  Larry Silverstein went on PBS and said that they had pulled the building.
[00:05:17.846 --> 00:05:20.007]  Demolition term for destroying it.
[00:05:20.307 --> 00:05:24.629]  In fact, the local public radio station was told that they were going to demolish Building 7.
[00:05:25.549 --> 00:05:30.634]   But since then, The public has been told to be quiet, not to ask questions.
[00:05:31.355 --> 00:05:35.399]  And the government hasn't even given us an official story of why Building 7 fell.
[00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:38.703]  They say they think fire caused it to fall.
[00:05:39.103 --> 00:05:48.213]  And in case you're wondering what pullet means, here's another example where they again use the term pullet to mean controlled demolition of buildings.
[00:05:48.934 --> 00:05:52.976]  Months after 9-11, the remains of 4, 5, and 6 were destroyed.
[00:05:53.576 --> 00:06:01.740]  Here's a clip from the same PBS documentary, where the head of engineering for the city of New York describes Bullitt as a controlled demolition.
[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:08.843]  By mid-December, the Department of Design and Construction had leveled World Trade Center buildings 4 and 5.
[00:06:08.943 --> 00:06:11.124]  Hello?
[00:06:11.925 --> 00:06:15.847]  Oh, we're getting ready to pull building 6.
[00:06:18.953 --> 00:06:21.335]  We had to be very careful how we demolished Building 6.
[00:06:21.395 --> 00:06:30.382]  We were worried about the Building 6 coming down and then damaging the slurry wall, so we wanted that particular building to fall within a certain area.
[00:06:30.521 --> 00:06:35.521]   There's a certain excitement in the air of bringing the last structure down at the World Trade Center.
[00:06:35.521 --> 00:06:46.521]   Seconds after seven collapsed, this is what Dan Rather had to say about it.
[00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:51.305]  A large building in most other cities would be one of the largest buildings in town, probably.
[00:06:51.926 --> 00:06:53.508]  Trade Center Building 7 has collapsed.
[00:06:53.888 --> 00:06:57.533]  Now, here we're going to show you a videotape of the collapse itself.
[00:06:57.353 --> 00:07:04.353]  Now we go to videotape the collapse of this building.
[00:07:04.353 --> 00:07:09.393]  It's amazing.
[00:07:09.423 --> 00:07:11.503]  Amazing, incredible, pick your word.
[00:07:12.443 --> 00:07:23.267]  For the third time today, it's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[00:07:26.808 --> 00:07:30.289]  I've said this, I think, five or six times in the last few hours, but I'm going to say it again.
[00:07:31.713 --> 00:07:33.994]  I know most of you watching this are already informed.
[00:07:34.034 --> 00:07:35.975]  It's why you're members of Mug Club.
[00:07:36.035 --> 00:07:37.636]  It's why you support InfoWars.

[00:07:48.180 --> 00:08:03.397]   So I keep going back to the fact that we need to relaunch the public understanding of Building 7 because back when I was exposing it, It's hard to believe 22, three years ago, a lot of people woke up, but most folks were still in denial and couldn't take it.
[00:08:03.897 --> 00:08:06.438]  But now we're in the age of awakening.
[00:08:07.198 --> 00:08:08.618]  We're in the age of the great awakening.
[00:08:09.458 --> 00:08:12.199]  People are really ready to investigate and find the truth.
[00:08:12.979 --> 00:08:21.121]  So take this interview, take clips out of it, takes large sections out of it, boil it down, make it even better.
[00:08:21.661 --> 00:08:22.361]  Take this report.
[00:08:23.359 --> 00:08:25.820]  Take these clips and get out to everybody you know.
