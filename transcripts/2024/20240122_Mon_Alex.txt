[00:00:01.158 --> 00:00:06.863]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:08.204 --> 00:00:12.567]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and support the InfoWars.
[00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.090]  You can feel it.
[00:00:17.511 --> 00:00:18.492]  Something is off.
[00:00:20.174 --> 00:00:22.195]  Things are getting stranger by the day.
[00:00:22.896 --> 00:00:27.740]  Just a coincidence, or is something more sinister happening right under our noses?
[00:00:28.544 --> 00:00:31.226]  We want to warn you now, this next story is disturbing.
[00:00:33.348 --> 00:00:43.595]  Namely, in earlier times, it was easier to control a million people, literally, than physically to kill a million people.
[00:00:43.635 --> 00:00:49.500]  Today, it is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control.
[00:00:52.282 --> 00:00:59.667]  I would like to reduce the number of people on the planet because there's too many of us.
[00:01:00.388 --> 00:01:03.931]  It's a planet of finite resources and we're using them up.
[00:01:06.473 --> 00:01:07.974]  First we've got population.
[00:01:08.474 --> 00:01:10.055]  That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:19.343]  Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.302]  The true ruling elite are a death cult.
[00:01:23.963 --> 00:01:24.723]  Pure evil.
[00:01:25.444 --> 00:01:27.425]  The elite are extremely wealthy.
[00:01:27.926 --> 00:01:30.047]  They have more money than you can think of.
[00:01:30.988 --> 00:01:34.731]  So why would they want even more money, even more control?
[00:01:36.838 --> 00:01:40.919]  It's because they use their wealth and power to execute their agenda.
[00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:42.779]  To live out their evil.
[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.121]  If you think this is just conspiracy theory, think again.
[00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:48.641]  Look around you.
[00:01:49.521 --> 00:01:52.582]  Everything benefits them and not humanity.
[00:01:52.922 --> 00:01:54.722]  The globalists have a religion.
[00:01:55.343 --> 00:01:59.444]  To the public it's sold as climate change or the global crisis.
[00:02:00.324 --> 00:02:02.784]  What is the basis of the climate change agenda?
[00:02:03.485 --> 00:02:04.925]  It's population control.
[00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.941]  It's depopulation.
[00:02:07.642 --> 00:02:11.827]  The elite look at us as parasites that need to be controlled and killed.
[00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.013]  There is an unelected network that controls what the public sees.
[00:02:18.194 --> 00:02:20.497]  Plausible deniability is their cover.
[00:02:20.977 --> 00:02:23.781]  They are playing dumb on every level to gaslight us.
[00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.035]  The same agendas throughout history are presented differently with the same goals.
[00:02:30.776 --> 00:02:35.542]  The elite are becoming restless and are now out in the open with who they really are.
[00:02:36.082 --> 00:02:39.666]  Corruption in the government is just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:02:40.427 --> 00:02:43.671]  The upper echelon at the top have an anti-human agenda.
[00:02:45.882 --> 00:02:47.122]  Threats of world war.
[00:02:47.563 --> 00:02:53.144]  But behind the scene, it's more about control and backdoor dealings between world governments.
[00:02:53.805 --> 00:03:00.567]  The open border, drug trafficking, human trafficking is covered up and controlled by our own government.
[00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:02.127]  It's deeper than that.
[00:03:03.347 --> 00:03:07.509]  There is a reason why most of these corruption networks never get shut down.
[00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.270]  These anti-humanists control mostly everything.
[00:03:13.462 --> 00:03:18.904]  You'd be shocked to know what the people in most power positions really think of the general public.
[00:03:20.025 --> 00:03:26.127]  The elite's corruption network operates like prison gangs or like a mafia, but on a larger scale.
[00:03:26.787 --> 00:03:27.487]  Blackmail.
[00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:28.708]  Controllers.
[00:03:29.228 --> 00:03:29.768]  Handlers.
[00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:31.209]  Money laundering.
[00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:36.171]  If you want to stay rich and powerful, you'll have to do their dirty work.
[00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:38.532]  They have their hands in everything.
[00:03:39.572 --> 00:03:42.473]  A lot of these players simply love the spotlight.
[00:03:43.213 --> 00:03:48.214]  Most of the celebrities, politicians, CEOs love the fame and fortune.
[00:03:48.935 --> 00:03:52.376]  But the ones at the top of these groups are completely evil.
[00:03:53.256 --> 00:04:00.198]  Many become unwillingly controlled by signing on into the club without knowing what they are actually involved with behind the scenes.
[00:04:01.038 --> 00:04:04.939]  Most of humanity is asleep and distracted by meaninglessness.
[00:04:06.365 --> 00:04:11.588]  The elite are warning us of a cyber attack, also known as a digital 9-11 event.
[00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:15.550]  The economy would collapse if we suffered an internet shutdown.
[00:04:17.694 --> 00:04:21.555]  The modern power grid relies on the internet to coordinate power plants.
[00:04:22.255 --> 00:04:30.577]  Without it, each country's national grid will become unbalanced, and local outages escalate into a blackout for most of the world.
[00:04:31.277 --> 00:04:37.578]  A society slipping into chaos will allow the elite to reset and rebuild a world for themselves.
[00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:41.059]  There will be events leading up to a total collapse.
[00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:45.860]  Domestic terror attacks, biological attacks, world wars.
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.643]  With each event, more and more control is gained.
[00:04:50.523 --> 00:04:51.704]  Time is running out.
[00:04:52.565 --> 00:04:57.749]  If society suffers from any of these trigger events, there might be no turning back.
[00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.131]  Humanity is at the crossroads.
[00:05:01.112 --> 00:05:02.593]  This is happening right now.
[00:05:04.575 --> 00:05:10.619]  We need to reject the global agenda and know who the world rulers really are and what they are up to.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.402]  The fight for humanity is happening.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.685]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, January 22nd, 2024.
[00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:30.637]  There are 287 days, 12 hours, 53 minutes, 26 seconds to the most important election in world history.
[00:05:30.657 --> 00:05:44.445]   A referendum on nationalism, freedom, capitalism, security, Or a tyrannical world government literally waging war against humanity.
[00:05:44.965 --> 00:05:47.686]  The battle is now.
[00:05:49.306 --> 00:05:55.888]  I cannot come up with words enough to hype how epic the historical crossroads we're at right now is.
[00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:58.289]  You don't need me to tell you, you know it.
[00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.550]  We've come so far in this fight against the globalists.
[00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:03.351]  Alright, listen.
[00:06:04.366 --> 00:06:25.035]  We have the biggest news yet from the Darien Gap, where the Communist Chinese are officially building highways and bridges out of South America into Panama, where they're also financing with State Department money, with the CHICOMS, gigantic illegal alien gathering centers, UN refugee camps.
[00:06:25.055 --> 00:06:31.798]  There are already huge ones down there, but Jan has now flown more drones in the last few days over it.
[00:06:31.858 --> 00:06:33.099]  He shot the video you see here.
[00:06:34.915 --> 00:06:41.717]  And these facilities are bigger than the Gigantor ones in South Texas on the border.
[00:06:42.897 --> 00:06:48.779]  I mean, we're talking football field after football field after football field of giant white tents.
[00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:51.980]  And you can see all the earth-moving equipment building more.
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.061]  This is a military attack on America.
[00:06:58.871 --> 00:07:02.372]  With a giant population who will vote the way they want and be a permanent underclass.
[00:07:02.412 --> 00:07:03.392]  This is insane.
[00:07:04.032 --> 00:07:11.174]  And so we watch these congressional hearings and you rarely hear about the UN facilities and the NGOs.
[00:07:11.234 --> 00:07:17.236]  And then, God love Veritas and others, they'll go and show the NGOs and say, breaking, NGOs discovered.
[00:07:18.316 --> 00:07:19.277]  NGOs discovered.
[00:07:19.377 --> 00:07:20.457]  I mean, I know that makes people tune in.
[00:07:20.477 --> 00:07:21.477]  Oh, it's discovered.
[00:07:22.197 --> 00:07:23.598]  It's like New York City discovered.
[00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.411]  Austin, Texas discovered it.
[00:07:26.591 --> 00:07:40.878]  It's the same UN NGOs that run the invasion of Europe and built the giant illegal alien camps out of the Middle East and out of Africa into Europe, are the ones running these.
[00:07:40.918 --> 00:07:42.238]  We have the names, we know the groups.
[00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:51.263]  Michael Yohn joins us today, fresh out of the jungle, to break this down from Central America, from his hotel room.
[00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:55.513]  And he's got a lot of raw footage he's sending us that hasn't even been seen yet.
[00:07:56.534 --> 00:07:58.455]  That is in the third hour today.
[00:08:00.357 --> 00:08:14.629]  We have Dr. Darren Beattie popping in at the bottom of the hour on the huge, unfolding, by the hour, federal pipe bomb, January 6th, false flag that didn't detonate event.
[00:08:15.309 --> 00:08:16.310]  He'll be joining us.
[00:08:17.251 --> 00:08:26.168]   I intend to open the phones up On a host of topics in the second hour into the fourth hour with the great Gerald Cilente.
[00:08:26.569 --> 00:08:32.031]  We have obviously the huge primary in New Hampshire about to unfold.
[00:08:32.071 --> 00:08:33.552]  We've got all those political developments.
[00:08:35.133 --> 00:08:43.016]  We've got big news out of Ukraine and Russia, huge news out of the Middle East with bases, U.S.
[00:08:43.116 --> 00:08:50.046]   bases in Iraq being showered with Ballistic missiles injuring a bunch of U.S.
[00:08:50.146 --> 00:08:50.646]  forces.
[00:08:51.786 --> 00:08:53.787]  More ships being attacked in the Red Sea.
[00:08:55.668 --> 00:08:57.788]  More missiles raining down into other U.S.
[00:08:57.848 --> 00:08:59.949]  bases on the edge of Syria.
[00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:10.633]  And now Biden has announced that they're going to go ahead and go to full-scale bombing of the Houthis backed by Iran in Yemen.
[00:09:12.631 --> 00:09:16.373]  So things are accelerating towards World War III quite nicely.
[00:09:16.413 --> 00:09:18.634]  In fact, I'd say we're already in the early stages of it.
[00:09:18.654 --> 00:09:19.654]  I think that's fair to say.
[00:09:19.694 --> 00:09:20.934]  Most analysts agree with that statement.
[00:09:21.655 --> 00:09:23.175]  But I've got to just say this first.
[00:09:25.116 --> 00:09:27.797]  Oh, there's more WF announcements about how they're going to cut the food off.
[00:09:28.378 --> 00:09:29.818]  And they're listing more food that's evil.
[00:09:31.859 --> 00:09:33.500]  And of course, it's always the most popular stuff.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.060]  Rice.
[00:09:36.841 --> 00:09:37.161]  Beef.
[00:09:38.802 --> 00:09:39.142]  Fish.
[00:09:40.623 --> 00:09:41.103]  Poultry.
[00:09:42.947 --> 00:09:43.187]  Wheat.
[00:09:44.627 --> 00:09:46.648]  And now, coffee.
[00:09:49.008 --> 00:09:50.068]  Boy, they're in the commodity.
[00:09:50.109 --> 00:09:57.730]  They don't want to say it's bad so they can control it and artificially sequester it so they can jack up the prices of it.
[00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:04.271]  It's all coming up today, but I want to go back to the theme of last night's Sunday show where I hosted 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:05.592]  as I've been doing for 16 years.
[00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:14.951]   The Sunday edition of this broadcast that I've been doing for 27 years And coming up in April will be the 30th anniversary of being on air, period.
[00:10:15.652 --> 00:10:17.093]  Hard to believe, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:17.814 --> 00:10:21.857]  And I'll be 50 next month in just a few weeks.
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.742]  Time flies by when you're fighting tyranny.
[00:10:28.943 --> 00:10:35.269]  But I want to talk about something that is extremely positive.
[00:10:37.634 --> 00:10:43.457]  I want to talk about something that is the biggest issue happening in the world today.
[00:10:48.059 --> 00:10:50.300]  And it's two-pronged.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:55.682]  It's political, but it's also spiritual.
[00:10:57.143 --> 00:11:03.525]  And the two things are inexplicably intertwined.
[00:11:06.587 --> 00:11:10.960]   And so, Later, I've got a frog in my throat here.
[00:11:12.721 --> 00:11:16.543]  That's what happens when I forget to eat breakfast and I wolf down a breakfast taco two minutes before I went live.
[00:11:16.563 --> 00:11:20.645]  I think that should do it.
[00:11:23.526 --> 00:11:30.490]  And that is the fact that things aren't going the way the New World Order wanted it to go.
[00:11:33.772 --> 00:11:37.974]  And the Globalists have explained to us exactly how they plan to have this takeover unfold.
[00:11:39.966 --> 00:11:48.752]  And so if we just grow up and look at their own documents and look at their own statements and look at the fact that what they said they do 70 years ago, they got done.
[00:11:48.812 --> 00:11:51.774]  And what they said they do 50 years ago, they got done.
[00:11:51.814 --> 00:11:53.915]  What they said they do 30 years ago, they've gotten done.
[00:11:54.915 --> 00:12:00.559]  And, and now we, we really don't want them to get the rest of it done because now we're in the end game.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:26.843]   And that means a world so hellish and so much death that It was hard to believe when it was hypothetical and it was academic and it was theoretical, but now we've been four years into the New World Order's operations.
[00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:36.570]  We always said that we'll go from beta to absolute war mode against humanity in 2020, completing the conquest and extermination.
[00:12:37.779 --> 00:12:39.721]  Almost everyone by 2047.
[00:12:41.642 --> 00:12:45.305]  The world, as you know, will be over with billions dead by 2030.
[00:12:45.485 --> 00:12:49.948]  And these are really staggering statements.
[00:12:50.008 --> 00:12:56.368]   But when everybody from Bill Gates to Jane Goodall to Klaus Schwab makes these statements
[00:12:56.368 --> 00:13:01.567]   and then they make good on cutting off the fertilizer and make good on cutting off the
[00:13:01.567 --> 00:13:07.968]   food and make good on cutting off the energy and this is just the first phase they say
[00:13:07.968 --> 00:13:14.288]   they want to cut almost all the energy off and not have it replaced by anything.
[00:13:14.288 --> 00:13:20.527]   They should really just focus on how horrible their operations are and how unspeakably evil
[00:13:20.527 --> 00:13:26.288]   they are and how ridiculously illegal and unpopular they are so that the public finally
[00:13:26.288 --> 00:13:27.807]  understands the ball game they're in.
[00:13:28.726 --> 00:13:29.746]  And that leads me to the next part.
[00:13:31.607 --> 00:13:38.790]  There's the political, there's the spiritual, those two major areas, but there's also how it's received.
[00:13:39.983 --> 00:13:57.572]  Because if they carry these operations out and aren't billed as the saviors, or if they're not casted in the role of the saviors, they will all be destroyed long before they implement it.
[00:13:57.632 --> 00:14:03.596]  So they must be in the position of the guardians of the earth while they kill it.
[00:14:04.876 --> 00:14:07.618]  They must be in position of the guardians of the nation states.
[00:14:09.155 --> 00:14:09.815]  Well, they destroy it.
[00:14:10.456 --> 00:14:13.178]  They've got to be the guardians of peace while they annihilate it.
[00:14:14.259 --> 00:14:17.341]  And I know for most listeners, you're like, yeah, we've heard this 5,000 times.
[00:14:17.401 --> 00:14:33.073]  Yeah, but you haven't heard this now dozens of times I know of in the last week of the Davos meeting with world leaders openly saying this to the bankers who run the operation.
[00:14:34.574 --> 00:14:48.852]   And Then political leaders around the world talking about it, and the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and Politico running headlines saying, globalism is not trusted, it's hated, and everyone's coming against us.
[00:14:49.832 --> 00:14:50.472]  What do we do?
[00:14:51.053 --> 00:14:53.654]  And they say, well, the number one mission is censor people more.
[00:14:54.754 --> 00:14:57.956]  That's how we make them trust us, we just lie to them more.
[00:14:59.236 --> 00:15:02.518]  So we've really reached beyond the tipping point.
[00:15:02.998 --> 00:15:05.599]  Tipping point was in about the last 12 months, about a year ago.
[00:15:07.441 --> 00:15:12.365]  We're now into the acceleration point in the tipping, because there's a point where a boat begins to capsize.
[00:15:13.106 --> 00:15:15.568]  That's the tipping point when it's going to capsize.
[00:15:16.068 --> 00:15:18.930]  Now the boat is going completely upside down into the water.
[00:15:20.512 --> 00:15:22.733]  So the boat's accelerating in the tipping point.
[00:15:23.194 --> 00:15:27.717]  But then what began the last few years, is the boat going to come over?
[00:15:27.737 --> 00:15:28.158]  You're not sure.
[00:15:28.178 --> 00:15:28.598]  You're not sure.
[00:15:28.658 --> 00:15:28.978]  Whoop!
[00:15:29.098 --> 00:15:29.699]  It's tipping over.
[00:15:29.859 --> 00:15:30.279]  It's going.
[00:15:30.319 --> 00:15:30.920]  It's tipping over.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:44.543]   And now, The globalists always intended to have a societal, cultural, industrial tipping point, and out of that crisis they would get total control and just a nightmare mad scientist society.
[00:15:46.083 --> 00:16:02.573]  But instead of there's a tipping point and a capsizing and a submersion of civilization, if as we go under we know they're the ones that sucked us under, what are they going to do?
[00:16:04.514 --> 00:16:09.177]  Well, they're going to try to get the boat turned back up because they know they're going down with us.
[00:16:10.137 --> 00:16:11.538]  In fact, they're going down the hardest.
[00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:40.793]   So this is simple cause and effect, simple politics, but because people weren't facing there was a corporate world government, even as it was set up, even as they were bragging about it and saying their aims of just, you'll drink sewage water, you'll live in a 250 square foot coffin apartment in 5G, bathing, you will eat bugs, you will Your convicted pedophiles will come as high priest and bounce your children on their leg in elementary school and preschool.
[00:16:42.274 --> 00:16:46.418]  People are just like, come on, it's not really that bad.
[00:16:46.438 --> 00:16:49.721]  Yeah, it is.
[00:16:50.701 --> 00:16:53.003]  So the bad news is we're in a lot of trouble.
[00:16:54.605 --> 00:17:04.125]   The good news is That everything they had planned was to be the saviors during this crisis.
[00:17:04.246 --> 00:17:07.187]  And instead, people are going, oh, you did this.
[00:17:08.307 --> 00:17:15.050]  And now they're learning all about their governmental systems and all about their central bank digital currencies and all about their ESGs.
[00:17:16.559 --> 00:17:42.775]  And even mainline leftist publications and mainline leftist podcasts, big ones, are now coming out against the New World Order and against ESGs and against four shots and everything because there's not enough money in the world to get most people to commit cultural, spiritual, physical death.
[00:17:45.956 --> 00:18:30.059]   And so we need to just, I think, ponder and reflect on the fact that, thanks to all the old-timers in the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s that talked about this and wrote books and had their little conferences and fought like hell to get the word out, that the second big wave that began in the early 1990s against the New World Order, when they began to roll out of Gen 21, and as it became public, A larger wave of people went, oh, this is true, this is really happening, and we read the globalist plans, we read their globalist treaties, and we said, this is terrible, we better start opposing this, and explain to people that you can fight all the different political heads of the Hydra all day long.
[00:18:31.439 --> 00:18:46.191]   But if you don't strike at the root of the world government project and its endgame for depopulation and transhumanism for the survivors, Then you're fighting a losing battle because you cut one head off, it just grows two more.
[00:18:47.232 --> 00:18:56.121]  But if you capture the beast and throw it off the edge of a 10,000 foot cliff, it's going to break its back and die.
[00:18:57.222 --> 00:19:10.528]   And so I'd use the analogy of not us, Even five heads of the Hydra, but us just as a mass, running headlong, billions of us, that's a giant wave a thousand times bigger than the New World Order Hydra.
[00:19:11.229 --> 00:19:13.230]  He looks real big until you pull back and see us.
[00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:21.754]  We're a giant wave, and all we gotta do is crash into the Hydra that's on the edge of a cliff, and it will go over.
[00:19:22.194 --> 00:19:22.975]  Here's the thing, though.
[00:19:23.255 --> 00:19:25.056]  We don't even need 10% of the wave to hit.
[00:19:26.724 --> 00:19:31.068]  Because yeah, those that do this will go over with the globalists over the edge of the cliff.
[00:19:31.628 --> 00:19:32.789]  Not spiritually, but physically.
[00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:38.253]  A lot of us have to still understand that in this next phase, this is a kamikaze operation.
[00:19:38.714 --> 00:19:49.543]  We don't want to wait till things get so bad that the whole wave hits them, because then the wave's going off the edge of the cliff, because the globalist plan would have been so far progressed, we will fall with them.
[00:19:50.103 --> 00:20:00.110]   It's up to us, the men, the serious men, and women that wish to join us, To understand that we're all going to die and be destroyed if we don't turn this around quickly.
[00:20:01.531 --> 00:20:07.936]  And so we're going to have to go head up against it right now so the women and children survive.
[00:20:09.097 --> 00:20:13.801]  And that's what this really comes down to at the end of the day.
[00:20:13.841 --> 00:20:30.549]   And I know it's epic and it sounds like a movie or it sounds like Hollywood, but All those archetypes in the Hero of a Thousand Faces comes from experiences and things that have happened over and over and over again in history.
[00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:33.331]  And so we're at that major turning point.
[00:20:33.731 --> 00:20:35.812]  We're at that major event horizon right now.
[00:20:35.832 --> 00:20:38.493]  And I've already gone past the point of no return.
[00:20:38.874 --> 00:21:02.205]   And I hope you realize that if the general public doesn't get behind men like me, And if we don't get behind people like Tucker Carlson, and President Trump, and Elon Musk, and none of these people are perfect, but I know I believe in a pro-human future, I don't believe in depopulation, neither does Donald Trump, neither does Elon Musk, neither does Tucker Carlson, that if you don't get behind us, you are suicidal.
[00:21:02.785 --> 00:21:03.286]  You're crazy!
[00:21:05.527 --> 00:21:07.008]  But I just want listeners to let that burn in.
[00:21:07.588 --> 00:21:09.689]  This isn't just some flavor of politics.
[00:21:09.709 --> 00:21:12.211]  This show isn't just some interesting novelty.
[00:21:13.533 --> 00:21:21.957]  If you go back 25 years ago, or 10 years ago, or 5 years ago, and you listen to this show, you'll think this guy's a time traveler.
[00:21:22.157 --> 00:21:22.517]  I'm not.
[00:21:22.697 --> 00:21:25.018]  The enemy has a frickin' blueprint, okay?
[00:21:26.445 --> 00:21:36.974]  So it's like, if they were destroying part of a city and building a new city there, and I had the blueprint, and I went to people and said, okay, in a couple years they're going to bulldozer all this, and they're going to build a building here and there, and people don't know what blueprints are.
[00:21:36.994 --> 00:21:44.500]  I got this fictional world I'm talking about, and they think you're a weirdo, but they suddenly see the bulldozers show up, and over the next few years, it all gets destroyed, and they build a new city.
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.301]  Later they're like, he's magic!
[00:21:46.601 --> 00:21:47.682]  He knew they were going to do this!
[00:21:48.203 --> 00:21:49.003]  No, I'm not magic.
[00:21:51.025 --> 00:21:55.789]  And that's the most frustrating part about this, is people either say I'm psychic, and everybody's psychic to a certain extent.
[00:21:57.868 --> 00:22:00.029]  Or I'm getting secret information.
[00:22:01.469 --> 00:22:03.610]  It's not secret, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:05.630]  So I got all this news to hit, and we're going to hit it.
[00:22:06.431 --> 00:22:10.772]  But if you missed last night's show, particularly the first hour.
[00:22:11.352 --> 00:22:12.312]  The first hour was Roger.
[00:22:13.273 --> 00:22:14.773]  So I really hit it in the second hour, excuse me.
[00:22:15.753 --> 00:22:23.275]  The second hour, we did a good job of explaining this, and I went over a bunch of tables, clubs, and it was very, very important.
[00:22:23.355 --> 00:22:24.736]  So this is a big deal.
[00:22:25.885 --> 00:22:28.146]  And we're covering the heart of the Hydra here.
[00:22:28.827 --> 00:22:33.929]  We're covering what it is, what its plans are, what it's doing, how to stop it.
[00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:51.999]  It's like I go on X every day and I'm, here's this UN treaty, here's the UN land grab, here's how they're doing it, here's how the State Department funds the NGOs with the Communist Chinese to build the refugee centers and they're building roads from South America all the way up to Mexico and into the United States.
[00:22:52.379 --> 00:22:54.040]  We need to cut the State Department money.
[00:22:56.584 --> 00:23:04.975]  And then I see the deranged comments, not all of them, but a portion of them, of awake people, but not fully awake, going, why don't you tell us it's the Catholics?
[00:23:05.756 --> 00:23:07.378]  Or why don't you tell us it's the Jews?
[00:23:07.798 --> 00:23:10.261]  Or why don't you tell us it's the, you know, the Masons or whatever?
[00:23:11.266 --> 00:23:24.970]  And sure, there's globalists in all those groups, but I'm like, here's the legislation, here's the executive order, here's the UN funding, here's the treaty, here's video of where these bases are, here's the roads, call Congress, get them to cut the funding.
[00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:28.031]  Like, I'm trying to do real world stuff.
[00:23:30.292 --> 00:23:37.194]  And I know it's fun to kind of stay in the 1980s, 1990s, oh look, the CERN symbol's three sixes.
[00:23:39.042 --> 00:23:39.602]  Yeah, I know.
[00:23:39.662 --> 00:23:40.903]  They're openly devil worshippers.
[00:23:41.403 --> 00:23:42.164]  I'll cover that later.
[00:23:42.744 --> 00:23:43.864]  They're openly saying it now.
[00:23:43.884 --> 00:23:45.305]  They're not hiding it in symbols anymore.
[00:23:49.287 --> 00:23:52.449]  But again, we can cut the money off from these guys.
[00:23:53.349 --> 00:24:00.433]  But once they get their cashless society in, once they get their social credit score in, it's going to be much harder to turn this around.
[00:24:00.753 --> 00:24:12.050]   And the Bible tells us That the system takes a long time to get in place, it finally gets in place, but there's so much opposition to it that it only lasts a very short time.
[00:24:14.371 --> 00:24:15.151]  Only a few years.
[00:24:16.072 --> 00:24:18.232]  And you can say, well, that's just the Bible, how to predict that?
[00:24:18.332 --> 00:24:19.593]  That is not divine.
[00:24:20.953 --> 00:24:28.736]  Or you can say, if you're from the satanic perspective, oh, it's predictive programming or it's self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:24:29.236 --> 00:24:34.248]   Well, regardless of what you think, It's being used as a blueprint of control.
[00:24:34.688 --> 00:24:38.591]  And you look at it, and you're like, yeah, you can see them getting a world cashless society.
[00:24:38.912 --> 00:24:40.473]  And you can see them setting all this up.
[00:24:41.534 --> 00:24:43.115]  And then it's going to blow up.
[00:24:43.576 --> 00:24:44.677]  It's never going to work.
[00:24:46.412 --> 00:24:51.974]  It's designed from the get-go to make people obsolete and make us turn against each other.
[00:24:52.634 --> 00:24:58.676]  And again, the globalists, through each phase of the crises, want to pose as the referee and the warden of the prison fight.
[00:24:59.076 --> 00:25:02.337]  But if we understand how they're running the show, they won't get away with it.
[00:25:02.377 --> 00:25:03.458]  So bottom line...
[00:25:04.318 --> 00:25:05.119]  This is a test.
[00:25:05.819 --> 00:25:09.921]  And we're not meant to just sit here and watch this happen to our children and other children.
[00:25:10.381 --> 00:25:14.664]  We're not supposed to sit here and go, oh, the New World Order is too big, it's too powerful, Satan's too powerful.
[00:25:15.124 --> 00:25:18.646]  Our God is infinity more powerful than Satan.
[00:25:21.708 --> 00:25:23.549]  And you can say, well, Satan doesn't exist.
[00:25:23.949 --> 00:25:30.453]  Look around you at people doing evil, even when it hurts them, because it's the desire of their heart and of their father, the devil.
[00:25:31.325 --> 00:25:37.490]  So whether you believe in that entity or not, that the spirit, the manifestation of it, it's a real thing in action.
[00:25:40.372 --> 00:25:45.836]  And so, this world is already going through incredible crisis.
[00:25:47.037 --> 00:25:52.962]  If you live in the West, crime's up, you don't have as much money, there's problems, mental illness exploding, suicide, death.
[00:25:54.246 --> 00:25:56.507]  Cancer exploding, life expectancy is going down.
[00:25:56.847 --> 00:26:04.970]  In the third world, last time the UN put numbers out five, six months ago, they admitted 80 plus million people have starved to death because of the lockdowns.
[00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:08.171]  They say because of the virus and the response to it.
[00:26:08.211 --> 00:26:09.571]  No, it was by their fear-mongering.
[00:26:10.532 --> 00:26:11.732]  Where's the news coverage of that?
[00:26:11.772 --> 00:26:12.492]  Just a footnote.
[00:26:12.612 --> 00:26:13.953]  Oh, the UN needs more money.
[00:26:14.313 --> 00:26:19.295]  The last four years, 87 million extra people starved to death because there was no jobs and no food.
[00:26:19.635 --> 00:26:22.476]  See, a lockdown here, you just exhaust your bank account.
[00:26:24.073 --> 00:26:25.014]  Maybe lose your house.
[00:26:26.096 --> 00:26:29.056]  A lockdown in the third world means you starve to death.
[00:26:29.056 --> 00:26:40.576]   And then the very NGOs that call for the lockdowns go, "Oh, give us money."
[00:26:40.795 --> 00:26:42.216]  The third world's starving to death.
[00:26:43.524 --> 00:26:59.785]  And again, I can sit here and cover all the new news and all the new clips and cover all this other interesting, you know, heads of the Hydras or whiskers on the Hydras or a tooth on the Hydra or a wart on the Hydra's head and we can attack the wart and we can, you know, we can attack a speck in its eye and we can stab him in the face all we want.
[00:27:01.127 --> 00:27:07.409]  You stab a hydrant, blood sprays out and flails around, and you bring down one of these people politically, but they just sprouts one more.
[00:27:07.829 --> 00:27:15.172]  You got to get into the guts of it, and you got to run your sword into the guts.
[00:27:17.913 --> 00:27:19.233]  You got to get it into that heart.
[00:27:20.894 --> 00:27:21.934]  That's an analogy maybe.
[00:27:21.994 --> 00:27:25.075]  I'm not saying any hydrants were harmed in this segment.
[00:27:26.172 --> 00:27:26.772]  I'll be right back.
[00:27:26.852 --> 00:27:27.793]  Infowars.com.
[00:27:27.813 --> 00:27:28.793]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:27:29.273 --> 00:27:31.634]  But the globalists, their narrative is not working.
[00:27:31.694 --> 00:27:32.515]  Everybody knows it's them.
[00:27:32.795 --> 00:27:33.615]  They are screwed.
[00:27:33.895 --> 00:27:35.056]  But they're still going to go through with it.
[00:27:35.776 --> 00:27:39.898]  You know, I stood up here and I yell and scream about the New World Order and the globalists.
[00:27:39.938 --> 00:27:44.039]  They're planning to get rid of the borders and release a virus and have a global power grab.
[00:27:44.079 --> 00:27:45.100]  And you saw it all come true.
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:46.961]  But there's a...
[00:27:48.115 --> 00:27:48.876]  Inverse of that.
[00:27:49.636 --> 00:27:54.620]  There's not just the bad stuff I'm telling you about, there's the good stuff I'm telling you about.
[00:27:55.380 --> 00:28:00.024]  And just like our information is the best you're going to find out there, our supplements are amazing.
[00:28:00.664 --> 00:28:04.427]  So our new special in the last half of January 2024 is here.
[00:28:04.927 --> 00:28:09.290]  It's Real Red Pill Plus and DNA Force Plus, both 50% off.
[00:28:09.451 --> 00:28:12.533]  We're calling it the Supercharged Special.
[00:28:13.193 --> 00:28:19.016]  You can get either one of these great items at 40% off individually or together for 50% off.
[00:28:19.316 --> 00:28:23.218]  Now, in the time we have left, I can't tell you why they're so great and what they do for your body.
[00:28:23.618 --> 00:28:28.360]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com, look at the ingredients and investigate it, and then get them.
[00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:31.161]  It supports the InfoWar and it'll change your life.
[00:28:31.742 --> 00:28:32.542]  Take advantage now.
[00:28:32.562 --> 00:28:33.762]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:28:34.983 --> 00:28:41.266]  All right, next hour, I'm going to plunge into The Globalist, making more announcements about all the food and commodities they're going to cut off.
[00:28:42.148 --> 00:28:44.890]  Including coffee to save the planet.
[00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:49.453]  We've got the big news obviously on the New Hampshire primary coming up tomorrow.
[00:28:50.173 --> 00:28:53.436]  We've got massive military news and so much more.
[00:28:53.456 --> 00:28:59.139]  And I'm going to get more into the Globalist in their own publication saying we're done, we're being destroyed, everyone hates us.
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:11.388]  Oh, you haven't figured it out yet that I've seen videos on Instagram with 40 million views and you've got hundreds of thousands of comments and I can't find one that doesn't hate Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and the New World Order.
[00:29:12.429 --> 00:29:14.010]  Yeah, you guys are screwed.
[00:29:15.432 --> 00:29:16.853]  Roger Stone talked about it yesterday on air.
[00:29:17.694 --> 00:29:19.135]  Everywhere he goes, everybody just loves him.
[00:29:19.195 --> 00:29:20.636]  Black, white, Hispanic, old, young.
[00:29:20.656 --> 00:29:21.717]  He used to get tons of hate.
[00:29:22.058 --> 00:29:22.578]  Same with me.
[00:29:23.499 --> 00:29:26.722]  In the last year and a half, I think I've been yelled at twice.
[00:29:26.742 --> 00:29:28.323]  It used to happen every time I went out in public.
[00:29:29.564 --> 00:29:30.945]  This is a big deal, folks.
[00:29:31.125 --> 00:29:35.990]  And world leaders confronting the globalists and saying they're criminals to their faces last week.
[00:29:37.551 --> 00:29:39.533]  But they need to gain the world's trust back.
[00:29:40.506 --> 00:29:41.567]  Now, they're not going to give up, though.
[00:29:42.167 --> 00:29:44.109]  They're going to stage crises, launch wars.
[00:29:44.189 --> 00:29:46.050]  They're trying to launch a race war here in America.
[00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:51.534]  They've got the Fed front running around to create this illusion of mask, right-wing supremacist out there.
[00:29:52.967 --> 00:29:57.270]  And somebody who's been all over this, probably more than anybody, is Dr. Darren J. Beattie.
[00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:09.938]  He's, of course, speechwriter, advisor to President Trump, Revolver.News, former professor of political science at Duke University, and he served the first Trump White House, probably back in the second, and he has been at the tip of the spear on January 6th.
[00:30:09.978 --> 00:30:20.805]   A lot of the research Tucker Carlson's used and others have used, it's really proven to be very accurate, and now the pipe bomb We now learn it's identical to training pipe bombs.
[00:30:21.386 --> 00:30:22.606]  They've manipulated the footage.
[00:30:22.666 --> 00:30:29.129]  There's a lot here, and we learn more every day since this story really exploded last week, pun intended.
[00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:31.390]  So, Doctor, thank you for joining us.
[00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:32.611]  Please give us the latest on this.
[00:30:34.632 --> 00:30:56.099]   Well, it's great to be back with you, and you know, we've been on this beat from the beginning, and I commend you for being there with us from the beginning, because now as this story is about to blow up, You know, there's an amazing push to damage control, but I think the regime understands that it can't be entirely contained at this point.
[00:30:56.459 --> 00:31:06.146]  There's a whole universe of investigation that we created related to the pipe bomb over the course of years of major groundbreaking reports.
[00:31:06.806 --> 00:31:11.329]  But this latest breakthrough comes courtesy of a Capitol Police video.
[00:31:11.369 --> 00:31:33.642]   Now, there have been a lot of talk about, oh, the Capitol Police footage and the new speaker had Promise to release the full 40,000 hours but initially release something like 90 and there was all this talk about it of, you know, the Capitol Police or the flash bangs and this or that and my attitude toward the release footage has always been it's very useful in terms of
[00:31:34.162 --> 00:31:42.892]  Reinforcing our existing understanding that we have footage of the Capitol Police aggravating the crowds and flash bombing the crowds, but we already knew that.
[00:31:42.972 --> 00:31:44.654]  There are already footage like that.
[00:31:44.934 --> 00:31:48.538]  We have footage of Capitol Police letting people into the Capitol.
[00:31:48.838 --> 00:31:50.480]  Scandalous, but we already knew that.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.762]  There was already footage of that.
[00:31:52.699 --> 00:32:07.245]  There's one piece of footage, however, that till recently went largely unnoticed that comes courtesy of Thomas Massey, which I think amounts to a true breakthrough in the pipe bomb case and the regime is freaking out about.
[00:32:07.605 --> 00:32:13.247]  And that is a brief seven minute clip from the Capitol Police surveillance footage.
[00:32:13.547 --> 00:32:16.088]  They were so reluctant to release this, by the way.
[00:32:16.568 --> 00:32:25.571]   It took a tremendous amount of pressure and ultimately Kevin McCarthy Under a tremendous amount of pressure, I had to force the Capitol Police to release the seven minute clip.
[00:32:26.452 --> 00:32:27.252]  So here it is.
[00:32:27.312 --> 00:32:35.434]  And this is the clip that's the subject of a mega viral thread and that I contextualize in a really bombshell piece on revolver.news.
[00:32:35.494 --> 00:32:39.395]  And so I'll walk your audience through it a little bit.
[00:32:40.555 --> 00:32:44.997]  So it starts out and I see you guys are a little bit ahead of me on the B roll.
[00:32:45.017 --> 00:32:49.759]   So I don't know if you can You can start from the beginning if you want.
[00:32:49.779 --> 00:32:53.802]  We'll start from the beginning in a minute, but explain to people why this is so big.
[00:32:54.322 --> 00:32:57.964]  And again, the response of the panic shows you where there's smoke, there's fire.
[00:32:57.984 --> 00:33:03.468]  Just like they would try to sue anybody that would talk about Seth Rich, and now we know there was a cover-up in that.
[00:33:03.768 --> 00:33:07.291]  So they are very afraid of this, just like we saw around Ray Epps.
[00:33:08.832 --> 00:33:09.433]  Absolutely.
[00:33:09.453 --> 00:33:14.978]  I mean, I've always said, based on our research, there's two smoking guns of the Fed's erection.
[00:33:15.479 --> 00:33:17.781]  One is Ray Epps, the other is the pipe bomb.
[00:33:18.141 --> 00:33:29.853]  And incidentally, these two stories, as the pipe bomb story unfolds and unravels with finality, the Ray Epps story and the pipe bomb story will converge.
[00:33:30.293 --> 00:33:56.677]   Perhaps not necessarily with Ray Epps himself, But the story of that first, that initial attack on the west perimeter of the Capitol by the Peace Monument at 1253, that story will converge with the pipe bomb story because one of the smoking guns of the pipe bomb story, which we've reported on extensively for years, is the remarkably coincidental timing of the pipe bombs' discovery.
[00:33:57.515 --> 00:34:06.677]  The first pipe bomb was discovered, allegedly by a random pedestrian, behind a trash can in a back alley by the Capitol Hill Club.
[00:34:07.097 --> 00:34:09.617]  It was discovered at 1240 p.m.
[00:34:10.298 --> 00:34:19.579]  with 20 minutes left on the dial, so set up precisely as to convey the impression it's going off at 1, which is when the certification proceeding was to begin.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:26.441]  The person who discovered that first pipe bomb called it in, and the Capitol Police began responding at 1250.
[00:34:27.915 --> 00:34:33.439]  That's three minutes before the Ray Epps breach on the West Perimeter.
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:41.025]  That iconic footage by the bike rack where Ray Epps is whispering in a guy's ear, that occurred at 1253.
[00:34:41.506 --> 00:34:45.329]  Capitol Police began responding to the first pipe bomb at 1250.
[00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:48.431]  Three minute time span.
[00:34:48.871 --> 00:34:55.196]  And then as we see in this new footage, which is footage of the DNC bomb being discovered, this begins at 105.
[00:34:58.087 --> 00:35:07.337]  So, scarcely 15 minutes after that first pipe bomb is discovered, the second one is discovered in a video that I'll explain shortly.
[00:35:07.357 --> 00:35:11.882]  And for those that are missing it, for Democrats that are tuned in, I understand they have low IQs, I'm serious.
[00:35:12.382 --> 00:35:13.804]  This shows coordination.
[00:35:14.385 --> 00:35:16.126]  It's all been coordinated for that time.
[00:35:16.747 --> 00:35:18.269]  Well, Alex, let me tell you this.
[00:35:18.729 --> 00:35:53.208]   The timing was so profoundly, the synchronicity was so profoundly striking that the publicly endorsed theory by then head of the Capitol Police, Steve Sun, Was that the pipe bombs were never intended to go off, but rather they were implanted in order to divert resources from that west perimeter attack on the Capitol, which is a plausible theory, especially because, again, another bombshell report from a long time ago, we showed that there were mechanical timers equipped on these pipe bombs.
[00:35:53.488 --> 00:35:59.873]   These pipe bombs were planted the evening before between 8 and 9 p.m.
[00:36:00.594 --> 00:36:04.280]  An egg timer isn't digital, so it only is an hour long.
[00:36:04.721 --> 00:36:05.882]  So again, it's ridiculous.
[00:36:06.573 --> 00:36:12.557]  And due to the National Forensics Explosive Report, there's no remote detonation capability.
[00:36:12.637 --> 00:36:18.862]  So, if the person actually intended for the bomb to go off, it would have gone off at most an hour after being planted.
[00:36:18.942 --> 00:36:20.823]  So, around 9 p.m.
[00:36:20.863 --> 00:36:24.005]  in a back alley would be a total dud, totally meaningless.
[00:36:24.386 --> 00:36:34.633]  So, the theory that these were planted as a diversion corresponds with the mechanical timer issue and also, most strikingly, with the timing of their discovery.
[00:36:34.913 --> 00:36:36.014]  What are the chances?
[00:36:36.434 --> 00:36:54.572]  That these pipe bombs are sitting around, the DNC-1 sitting around for 17 hours, the RNC-1 for 16 hours, undiscovered, and then magically both are discovered within a 15-minute window of the initial attack on the Capitol and certification proceeding.
[00:36:54.952 --> 00:36:57.194]  There's simply no way that that's a coincidence.
[00:36:57.535 --> 00:37:10.133]   The only problem is If these were planted as an intended diversion, how did the pipe bomber count on one, a random pedestrian, and two, a plainclothes Capitol Police officer?
[00:37:10.493 --> 00:37:15.395]  How did he count on these people discovering the bomb within a 15-minute time frame?
[00:37:15.575 --> 00:37:17.254]  that corresponds to that attack.
[00:37:17.254 --> 00:37:19.855]   And then you talk about the footage, and we'll get to that.
[00:37:19.855 --> 00:37:23.975]   That I will leave as, that question I will leave as an exercise for the reader.
[00:37:23.975 --> 00:37:29.655]   So now let's go to the video footage that is so explosive, and even as a self-contained matter,
[00:37:29.655 --> 00:37:31.215]  the footage is remarkable.
[00:37:31.215 --> 00:37:35.254]   So the footage begins at around 1.05, again, scarcely 15 minutes
[00:37:35.254 --> 00:37:40.914]   after the first one was discovered, where an individual with a backpack comes into frame
[00:37:40.914 --> 00:37:45.914]  and walks over to a Metro PD SUV.
[00:37:45.914 --> 00:37:53.895]   Now, both the Metro PD SUV and the black SUV are part of Kamala Harris's protection detail
[00:37:53.895 --> 00:37:55.055]  in the Secret Service.
[00:37:55.082 --> 00:37:59.765]  Kamala Harris, then VP-elect, was in the building, the DNC building at the time.
[00:38:00.165 --> 00:38:02.087]  So here's the guy we can watch in real time.
[00:38:02.107 --> 00:38:13.575]  He's approaching the vehicle and he informs both cars, both Secret Service details, that there's a pipe bomb within feet of them.
[00:38:14.753 --> 00:38:23.276]  Now, the thing that's striking about this is that there's zero concern whatsoever in reaction to this information.
[00:38:23.536 --> 00:38:25.757]  Now, the first thing you do is you move the vehicles away.
[00:38:25.777 --> 00:38:28.878]  You tell everybody in the building, uh, evacuate.
[00:38:29.699 --> 00:38:31.739]  And the clips are on my Twitter thread.
[00:38:31.819 --> 00:38:35.041]  So possibly your guys can like B roll it along.
[00:38:35.201 --> 00:38:38.122]  So here, here are the guys informing the vehicles.
[00:38:38.742 --> 00:38:44.024]  Now it's going to be over a minute before they even bothered getting out of the vehicle.
[00:38:44.605 --> 00:38:46.767]  After having been informed of these pipe bombs.
[00:38:47.368 --> 00:38:53.894]  Notice the people just casually crossing the street in the direction of the pipe bombs, not even warned about it.
[00:38:53.954 --> 00:39:02.161]  In fact, most scandalously of all, there's a group of children at around the 109 minute mark.
[00:39:02.461 --> 00:39:06.085]  At 109, a group of children crossed that street.
[00:39:06.966 --> 00:39:10.829]  And walk within feet of the pipe bomb as the Secret Service people are there.
[00:39:11.229 --> 00:39:15.812]  The Secret Service people are utterly unconcerned for their protectee, Kamala Harris.
[00:39:16.233 --> 00:39:24.118]  They're utterly, here it is, utterly unconcerned for the safety of these children who are walking across the street or about to.
[00:39:25.039 --> 00:39:27.080]  And utterly concerned for their own safety.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:30.343]  They're standing within feet of the bomb right by that bench.
[00:39:31.611 --> 00:39:49.238]  So either they have no preservation instincts and completely and flagrantly violate protocol that would pertain to the discovery of a bomb as a Secret Service agent, or somehow they knew that the bomb was fake.
[00:39:49.838 --> 00:39:52.879]  And then again, another troubling question emerges.
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:55.040]  How do they know it's fake?
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.761]  Look at them just casually standing around.
[00:39:56.841 --> 00:39:57.201]  Look at...
[00:39:57.824 --> 00:39:58.145]  Look at this.
[00:39:58.566 --> 00:40:02.875]  They're letting this group of children cross the street and walk within feet of where the bomb is.
[00:40:03.196 --> 00:40:05.921]  Do these people look at all concerned about the bomb?
[00:40:06.402 --> 00:40:06.663]  No.
[00:40:06.944 --> 00:40:08.427]  How do they know it's fake?
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.161]  How do they know that?
[00:40:11.181 --> 00:40:15.805]  I mean, their body language is like they are walking over to a snow cone stand or something.
[00:40:16.765 --> 00:40:17.666]  How do they know that?
[00:40:17.946 --> 00:40:18.727]  Now watch this.
[00:40:19.087 --> 00:40:24.051]  Shortly after, there's going to be a Capitol Police officer that comes into the right side of the frame.
[00:40:24.392 --> 00:40:26.513]  He's going to walk right up to it and take a picture.
[00:40:26.533 --> 00:40:26.914]  Look at that.
[00:40:26.974 --> 00:40:28.035]  It's on the right hand side.
[00:40:28.075 --> 00:40:28.575]  Look at this.
[00:40:29.476 --> 00:40:30.337]  He's taking a picture.
[00:40:31.377 --> 00:40:32.899]  Comes up and then he leaves.
[00:40:33.399 --> 00:40:38.003]  And then for the first time ever, they actually speed things up and they get the hell out of there.
[00:40:38.882 --> 00:40:40.242]  It's the first time they ever move.
[00:40:41.603 --> 00:40:42.003]  Look at this.
[00:40:42.583 --> 00:40:43.804]  They're getting the hell out of there.
[00:40:43.824 --> 00:40:45.524]  Because now it's time to be part of the production.
[00:40:45.604 --> 00:40:46.684]  Now it's time to look secure.
[00:40:47.585 --> 00:40:49.125]  And here's the crazy thing.
[00:40:49.445 --> 00:40:51.646]  So, they're unconcerned for themselves.
[00:40:51.726 --> 00:40:53.167]  They're unconcerned for the children.
[00:40:53.207 --> 00:40:55.327]  They don't care about Kamala Harris.
[00:40:55.867 --> 00:41:03.530]  And yet, and this guy walks right up to takes a picture, and I'm informed very reliably by high-level sources who've seen this video.
[00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:04.930]  This is just a seven-minute video.
[00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:06.771]  There's a lot more video that's not out yet.
[00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:16.736]  But there's video after this of the authorities using a bomb-safe robot to defuse this pipe bomb.
[00:41:16.936 --> 00:41:24.762]  The robot that, the bomb that they just let children walk right by, it's safe enough for that, but it's so dangerous they need to use a bomb-safe robot.
[00:41:24.782 --> 00:41:27.003]  Sure, that's where the theater, that's where the theater comes in.
[00:41:27.063 --> 00:41:28.044]  That's the theater!
[00:41:28.384 --> 00:41:34.408]  Now, let me, let me just reinforce some contextual facts on this.
[00:41:34.864 --> 00:41:39.586]  Now, this is a Secret Service detail that's exhibiting such bizarre behavior.
[00:41:40.106 --> 00:41:42.427]  Now, why is the Secret Service there in the first place?
[00:41:42.447 --> 00:41:47.669]  Well, as I mentioned, Kamala Harris, who was then VP-elect, was in the DNC building.
[00:41:47.969 --> 00:41:52.671]  Here's something crazy, Alex, and I know you know this, but it's really important to emphasize.
[00:41:52.951 --> 00:41:55.712]  This is going to be a big part of how this all blows up in their face.
[00:41:57.373 --> 00:42:04.076]  Kamala Harris kept it secret that she was in the DNC building on January 6th.
[00:42:05.493 --> 00:42:11.054]  She covered that up for almost a year before it leaked and still she hasn't acknowledged it.
[00:42:11.374 --> 00:42:12.335]  Now think about this.
[00:42:13.375 --> 00:42:19.956]  Kamala Harris is one of the most politically opportunistic creatures on this planet.
[00:42:20.917 --> 00:42:37.202]   Why on earth would Kamala Harris forgo the opportunity to milk politically the fact that she was within a hair's width of losing her life to this ostensible MAGA And stop right there, we're going to go back to this, but
[00:42:37.202 --> 00:42:39.093]  let me just add context to back you up.
[00:42:39.093 --> 00:42:43.593]   How many Democrats like AOC and others got caught lying, saying they were in the Capitol
[00:42:43.593 --> 00:42:47.893]   and were scared and almost got killed in fear for their lives when they were in office buildings down the road?
[00:42:47.893 --> 00:42:51.893]   So here she is with an actual pipe bomb right up at the window where she's at,
[00:42:51.893 --> 00:42:54.093]  and they don't want this out for some reason.
[00:42:54.093 --> 00:42:57.393]  That is another big thing here that doesn't make sense.
[00:42:57.393 --> 00:42:59.393]  It's simply inexplicable.
[00:42:59.384 --> 00:43:01.925]  It does not lend itself to an innocent explanation.
[00:43:01.965 --> 00:43:06.626]  Think furthermore, you know, you've made a big deal about this and rightly so.
[00:43:06.967 --> 00:43:11.428]  Think about Joe Biden's big speech on the third anniversary, January 6th.
[00:43:11.888 --> 00:43:20.672]  Imagine him foregoing the opportunity to mention that his vice president almost lost her life to the pipe bomb.
[00:43:21.392 --> 00:43:23.713]  Why would he neglect to mention that?
[00:43:26.043 --> 00:43:36.473]  The truth has to be so dark and so damning and so embarrassing for them to cover it up when it goes completely against their political interests.
[00:43:36.493 --> 00:43:38.674]  And it's not as though they've moved on from January 6th.
[00:43:40.003 --> 00:43:42.624]  Biden gave this huge speech on the third anniversary.
[00:43:42.644 --> 00:43:47.325]  They're running on Trump's a dictator, they're planning a takeover, they're going to have martial law, they're going to kill us all.
[00:43:47.626 --> 00:43:48.606]  So let me ask you this.
[00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:54.288]  Let me ask you this, Doctor, and finish up on their points on this, but larger picture.
[00:43:54.928 --> 00:43:56.148]  Then we move into speculation.
[00:43:56.588 --> 00:43:58.049]  What do you think really went on?
[00:43:58.929 --> 00:44:00.050]  What was supposed to happen?
[00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:03.071]  Why are they always never wanting to talk about the pipe bomb?
[00:44:03.771 --> 00:44:07.092]  I mean, I guess we're forced to speculate, but clearly something's being covered up here.
[00:44:09.011 --> 00:44:10.692]  Yeah, I mean, it's clear a cover-up.
[00:44:10.832 --> 00:44:14.315]  I am 100% certain this is a cover-up.
[00:44:14.615 --> 00:44:16.617]  This is a phony operation.
[00:44:16.717 --> 00:44:27.065]  And, you know, usually these things we get to the point where any reasonable, in-person, digesting information in good faith comes to an obvious conclusion.
[00:44:27.345 --> 00:44:30.568]  And I think that's where we are based on our extensive reporting on Ray Epps.
[00:44:31.232 --> 00:44:35.554]  But in this case, in the pipe bomb case, I think we're actually going to get the smoking gun.
[00:44:35.634 --> 00:44:36.675]  We are so close.
[00:44:36.955 --> 00:44:42.938]  We are one step removed from actually getting the smoking gun and then they're going to be in full damage control.
[00:44:42.998 --> 00:44:47.000]  You mean the smoking gun that they or somebody who's close to them planted?
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.161]  I think it's clear they know it.
[00:44:48.201 --> 00:44:48.901]  It's all a setup.
[00:44:49.181 --> 00:44:50.662]  You can see the body language.
[00:44:51.122 --> 00:45:04.308]   One other thing, Alex, when this happens, I guarantee you the defense, the people responsible They are scrambling and brainstorming right now to think about how they can maximize damage control.
[00:45:04.609 --> 00:45:19.961]  Number one, by feeding the final steps of this story to more domesticated journalists so Revolver News doesn't get credit because they don't want to lend legitimacy to us because then the next thing we cover can't be ignored and they can't dismiss it as conspiracy theory.
[00:45:20.301 --> 00:45:29.085]   So they're going to try to launder this story to a more friendly or domesticated media source Because it's going to come out inevitably.
[00:45:29.105 --> 00:45:30.166]  Doc, we only have a few minutes left.
[00:45:30.506 --> 00:45:32.787]  I totally agree with you, but you don't like to speculate.
[00:45:33.228 --> 00:45:36.590]  But we know it's clearly an FBI training device.
[00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:42.153]  They clearly act like it's no big deal for a long time, then suddenly put on a kabuki theater for everybody.
[00:45:42.733 --> 00:45:44.174]  Harris covers up, she's in the building.
[00:45:44.534 --> 00:45:51.498]  Somehow she was going to be written into the narrative that somebody tried to go after her, but for some reason they decided not to go with that.
[00:45:51.518 --> 00:45:52.899]  So we're having to speculate now.
[00:45:53.779 --> 00:45:54.600]  Yeah.
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:55.841]  But you say it's about to break.
[00:45:55.981 --> 00:45:57.242]  A, what is about to break?
[00:45:57.562 --> 00:46:01.965]  And then speculating or talking to a lot of smart people that you do, there's also a lot of whistleblowers.
[00:46:02.966 --> 00:46:04.287]  Do we know what the narrative was?
[00:46:06.161 --> 00:46:11.987]  Well, you know, truthfully, I am disinclined to speculate just because we're so close.
[00:46:12.167 --> 00:46:14.329]  I want to stick with what's rock solid.
[00:46:14.669 --> 00:46:18.393]  But I can say with absolute confidence, this was an op.
[00:46:18.693 --> 00:46:22.837]  And they're now, they know that this has reached escape velocity.
[00:46:22.897 --> 00:46:25.780]  The thread that I did on this is like 11.5 million views.
[00:46:27.661 --> 00:46:31.903]  Um, we did an interview with Tucker concurrently with that, with millions of views.
[00:46:32.123 --> 00:46:33.844]  This is an escape velocity.
[00:46:34.164 --> 00:46:45.068]  And this latest video is so damning that, you know, at the very least they have to explain the flagrant violation of protocol for these Secret Service agents doing nothing while children walk by the bomb.
[00:46:45.628 --> 00:46:47.749]  And, you know, there has to be an explanation.
[00:46:47.769 --> 00:46:51.290]  Sure, what they're dreading is congressional hearings, just like Ray Epps became a major point.
[00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:52.971]  This is about to become the next point.
[00:46:52.991 --> 00:46:55.772]  I just wanted, I want to squeeze in one final point in there.
[00:46:56.392 --> 00:47:05.977]  The core strategy of their damage control is going to be to cordon off the pipe bomb story, which is going to be a huge scandal in its own right.
[00:47:06.497 --> 00:47:14.121]  But they're going to try to cordon that off to prevent it from metastasizing narratively into other dimensions January 6th.
[00:47:14.521 --> 00:47:26.582]   But they cannot do that because Of the perfect synchronicity between the timing of the pipe bomb's discovery and that initial breach on the Capitol by the Peace Monument.
[00:47:27.162 --> 00:47:33.807]  When it's exposed that the, finally, that the pipe bomb thing was an op, it will necessarily follow.
[00:47:33.867 --> 00:47:46.778]  The next domino necessarily is that that Peace Monument breach was a fed op in precisely the way that we described in our now classic piece called Meet Ray Epps Part 2.
[00:47:47.941 --> 00:47:50.882]  These two stories are going to converge.
[00:47:51.482 --> 00:47:53.443]  We have a few minutes left.
[00:47:54.683 --> 00:47:55.283]  A few minutes left.
[00:47:55.344 --> 00:47:56.284]  When do you expect this?
[00:47:56.304 --> 00:47:57.504]  It's already been exploding.
[00:47:57.744 --> 00:47:59.645]  Again, no pun intended, but it is exploding.
[00:48:00.345 --> 00:48:02.166]  Obviously, Ray Epps, so much pressure.
[00:48:02.206 --> 00:48:07.227]  They have to charge him, then no prison time when he's there coordinating way more than anybody else.
[00:48:07.328 --> 00:48:10.389]  And then people that did nothing get 20 years.
[00:48:11.209 --> 00:48:12.669]  He's there saying, I coordinated it.
[00:48:12.709 --> 00:48:15.110]  Go in, go in, go in, ramming signs into people.
[00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:17.411]  And he gets no jail time.
[00:48:18.934 --> 00:48:19.414]  Absolutely.
[00:48:19.474 --> 00:48:22.876]  I mean, they're desperately trying to tie up the loose ends there.
[00:48:22.956 --> 00:48:29.019]  And so, you know, when we see it, we say no jail time, they waited, you know, almost three years to charge him with anything.
[00:48:29.079 --> 00:48:32.661]  And whereas he was one of the first people put on the FBI's most wanted list.
[00:48:32.701 --> 00:48:45.081]   So they think the people are so dumb, that even if they give him a misdemeanor charge, a phony misdemeanor wrist slap charge three years after January 6th and don't give him any jail time.
[00:48:45.401 --> 00:48:50.968]  They think they're refuting us by saying, oh look, so you said he was fed because we didn't charge him.
[00:48:51.008 --> 00:48:52.910]  Well, he finally got a misdemeanor charge.
[00:48:52.970 --> 00:48:54.251]  I guess you guys are debunked.
[00:48:54.592 --> 00:49:00.118]  I guess you guys are conspiracy theorists now because, you know, we finally charged him with a misdemeanor charge.
[00:49:00.138 --> 00:49:02.701]  And you predicted when he got charged that it would be no time spent.
[00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:07.591]  Yeah, well, but even if there was time spent, it wouldn't change the fundamental analysis.
[00:49:07.871 --> 00:49:09.172]  What's out there is out there.
[00:49:09.452 --> 00:49:13.573]  So no matter what they have done, it's like they can't put the toothpaste back in the tube.
[00:49:14.013 --> 00:49:25.276]  The Ray Epps story is already out there and there's no explanation for, you know, the full range of things that we've put forth to the public year for years now.
[00:49:25.376 --> 00:49:30.834]   Like a misdemeanor charge, even if they did give them six months, Wouldn't have explained.
[00:49:30.994 --> 00:49:31.834]  We only got about a minute left.
[00:49:31.874 --> 00:49:32.675]  Thanks for the time.
[00:49:32.895 --> 00:49:34.375]  Revolver.News, amazing work.
[00:49:34.956 --> 00:49:36.857]  You've been just over the target for years.
[00:49:37.897 --> 00:49:39.918]  In 30, 40 seconds, what's the time frame?
[00:49:39.958 --> 00:49:40.839]  You obviously know a lot more.
[00:49:40.859 --> 00:49:41.679]  You're not staying on air.
[00:49:42.019 --> 00:49:43.700]  I've got some of the same intel coming in.
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:46.382]  Obviously, we shouldn't go too far.
[00:49:46.402 --> 00:49:48.223]  Just let it naturally come out.
[00:49:48.283 --> 00:49:49.683]  But they're definitely scared of this.
[00:49:50.043 --> 00:49:51.204]  What's the timetable here?
[00:49:52.525 --> 00:50:01.090]   Well, I couldn't say specifically, but I suspect this will all unravel in the coming Couple months, maybe even sooner.
[00:50:02.811 --> 00:50:05.032]  What I've heard is there's a whistleblower is about to come out.
[00:50:06.433 --> 00:50:11.636]  Well, you know, there are a lot of whistleblowers of different varieties and some have accurate information.
[00:50:11.716 --> 00:50:13.357]  Some don't, unfortunately.
[00:50:13.397 --> 00:50:15.198]  And sometimes that's malicious.
[00:50:15.218 --> 00:50:19.360]  Sometimes it's just, you know, a well-intentioned mistake.
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:27.845]  And so I think it's really important to severely vet any information coming out, because again, as part of the.
[00:50:28.645 --> 00:50:31.986]  Limited hangout as part of the damage control strategy.
[00:50:32.126 --> 00:50:43.289]  Oftentimes the government will give sort of fake or half fake information to people or whistleblowers to serve to discredit the story when certain aspects are shown to be false.
[00:50:43.329 --> 00:50:50.811]  So we all need to be very careful and severely evaluate and vet information coming out in the next couple months.
[00:50:51.491 --> 00:51:07.411]  I totally agree, but in summation, of all the different federal operations and operators that, you know, too many to count, they admitted in federal court, too many operators to count, while the FBI director tried to deny it, this is going to be cutting dry the feds, trying to do some nasty stuff, and they're in a lot of trouble, and that's good.
[00:51:07.451 --> 00:51:08.653]  Dr. Beattie, thank you so much.
[00:51:08.673 --> 00:51:09.534]  Indeed.
[00:51:09.614 --> 00:51:10.074]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:51:10.816 --> 00:51:16.560]  We're going to start the next hour and come back and get into the latest WF videos that are so insane.
[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:17.320]  They're coming for your food.

[00:51:23.764 --> 00:51:25.705]  I'm going to be opening the phones up.
[00:51:25.805 --> 00:51:29.628]  Michael Yan joins us from Panama with the most shocking information yet.

[00:52:54.602 --> 00:52:55.682]  Bring us this information.
[00:52:56.183 --> 00:53:00.425]  You can see here the Great Awakening orbiting the Great Reset.
[00:53:01.145 --> 00:53:10.889]  Although the depopulation systems of the Great Reset are not yet fully operational, the Great Reset does have a strong conspiracy network.
[00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:17.252]  It is protected by a satanic shield, which can be disabled by the Great Awakening.
[00:53:17.632 --> 00:53:23.835]  The Great Reset must be deactivated if any victory for humanity is to be accomplished.
[00:53:24.893 --> 00:53:38.916]  Once the Great Awakening deactivates the shield, InfoWars.com forward slash show will cover the truth while Info Warriors fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the Great Reset.
[00:53:39.417 --> 00:53:43.157]  Alex Jones has volunteered to lead the fighter attack.
[00:53:43.298 --> 00:54:00.657]   Get a signed copy of The Great Awakening today at Infowarsstore.com As leaders in government, business and society, we beer.
[00:54:00.905 --> 00:54:09.893]  A particular responsibility to rebuild trust in how we assume our own role as trustees.
[00:54:10.294 --> 00:54:31.014]   Hidden behind the lost attempt to rebuild trust for the Davos 2024 attendees sugar-coated totalitarian strategy for world domination is a panicked roach nest of sociopaths Partaking in treason, drugs, high-end prostitutes and delusions of grandeur.
[00:54:31.434 --> 00:54:37.001]  Are you worried that if all the details come out about the Epstein trial that your boss might...
[00:54:37.868 --> 00:54:41.972]  Get into legal trouble like Prince Andrew did or some of the others on the list.
[00:54:42.593 --> 00:54:46.757]  It must have been bad for Melinda to divorce him over Epstein.
[00:54:46.797 --> 00:54:48.299]  I mean, that's what Melinda Gates said.
[00:54:48.499 --> 00:54:50.441]  Because he wouldn't stop visiting Epstein.
[00:54:50.461 --> 00:54:53.364]  He was evil, personified.
[00:54:53.384 --> 00:54:55.426]  I had nightmares about it afterwards.
[00:54:55.446 --> 00:54:57.268]  I mean, how can you work for a guy like that?
[00:54:57.628 --> 00:55:03.392]  Treason, not trust, seemed to be the actual theme at this year's Davos.
[00:55:03.652 --> 00:55:06.655]  We are on the way to a new order so we are between orders.
[00:55:07.415 --> 00:55:20.552]   What are we able to keep on the positive side from the old order to bring into a new At the heart of it will be many of the core principles and core institutions of the existing order.
[00:55:20.892 --> 00:55:23.214]  It's absolutely critical that we accelerate.
[00:55:23.815 --> 00:55:29.720]  I don't want this, obviously, but if you wound up with a different president who was opposed to climate crisis, I got news for you.
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:33.803]  No one politician anywhere in the world can undo what is happening now.
[00:55:34.104 --> 00:55:35.465]  The marketplace is doing this.
[00:55:35.985 --> 00:55:47.953]  Many of these so-called righteous saviors of humanity chose to stick their nose up at the thought of addressing the peasants when confronted by journalists asking basic questions.
[00:55:48.134 --> 00:55:54.278]  I want to ask about McKinsey and those huge contracts you guys got from the Canadian government after meeting with Christia Freeland.
[00:55:54.758 --> 00:55:55.459]  Oh, don't run away!
[00:55:56.099 --> 00:55:56.599]  Don't run away.
[00:55:56.639 --> 00:55:59.480]  Why don't you want to talk about your contract with Canadian taxpayers?
[00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:02.621]  I mean, surely you believe in transparency.
[00:56:03.061 --> 00:56:05.422]  What are your plans going forward?
[00:56:05.582 --> 00:56:07.283]  Not going to talk about it right now here.
[00:56:07.743 --> 00:56:10.264]  Are you pulling back from it the same way BlackRock is?
[00:56:11.364 --> 00:56:11.544]  No.
[00:56:11.964 --> 00:56:16.266]  And why don't we just set this up formally, but no, we're not pulling back from it.
[00:56:16.646 --> 00:56:19.066]  Are you worried about misinformation and disinformation?
[00:56:19.086 --> 00:56:22.688]  That's been a big focus of the World Economic Forum this year.
[00:56:23.048 --> 00:56:23.768]  Do you agree with that?
[00:56:25.177 --> 00:56:27.398]  You don't have enough credentials to go up there apparently.
[00:56:28.279 --> 00:56:33.502]  But what about the forcible nature that so many people were forced to take the jab or lose their job?
[00:56:34.463 --> 00:56:42.047]  Well what I'd like to actually just say within this is that we're certainly proud of the efforts that collectively that the health care sector made.
[00:56:42.067 --> 00:56:43.928]   Right and I know that and I'm not I'm just feeling that.
[00:56:43.948 --> 00:56:50.789]  I think that if you'd like to discuss any of this further, that you can certainly be in contact with our media relations group and they'd be happy to get in touch with you on it, okay?
[00:56:50.929 --> 00:56:52.690]  I don't think they would be happy to get in touch with me.
[00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:54.710]  I'm asking you about the forcible nature.
[00:56:54.990 --> 00:56:59.891]  That if people didn't, if they weren't forced to take your medicine against their will, they'd be fired.
[00:57:00.171 --> 00:57:05.272]  I need to go on this, but what I would say is that all of this comes down to local decisions that are made by countries.
[00:57:05.312 --> 00:57:06.052]  Local decisions?
[00:57:06.332 --> 00:57:07.493]  I think you profited by it.
[00:57:07.893 --> 00:57:09.914]   Dr. Tedros, How you doing?
[00:57:10.514 --> 00:57:18.940]  Do you think you did well in COVID and if you're going to do as well in disease X?
[00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:20.061]  What is disease X?
[00:57:21.001 --> 00:57:22.443]  Mr. Tedros, what is disease X?
[00:57:23.683 --> 00:57:26.125]  And when is China going to release it?
[00:57:26.145 --> 00:57:32.830]  The number one issue that Klaus Schwab says is the goal for the WEF is to combat misinformation and disinformation.
[00:57:33.170 --> 00:57:34.191]  Is that important to META?
[00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:36.332]  I'm heading to my booth.
[00:57:37.054 --> 00:57:37.876]  This is not an interview.
[00:57:38.136 --> 00:57:41.223]  How come Facebook is censoring the internet?
[00:57:41.544 --> 00:57:43.469]  Is it your plan to interfere with the 2024 election?
[00:57:45.362 --> 00:57:46.903]  Sorry, cannot hear through the press.
[00:57:47.103 --> 00:57:51.445]  The Davos attendees of 2024 need to calm the f**k down.
[00:57:51.765 --> 00:57:59.369]  The overselling of an imminent nightmare future is really pissing huge populations of Team Humanity off.
[00:57:59.869 --> 00:58:11.435]  What's to stop the hundreds of millions of us from holding a confab of our own aimed at arresting these proponents of a genocidal New World Order?
[00:58:11.675 --> 00:58:17.500]   53 years after the WEF was founded, They have 75 million children working in their supply chains.
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:24.487]  The problem is that many of these companies have business models that have actually increased misery, hunger, malnutrition, and child labor.
[00:58:24.847 --> 00:58:38.615]   The kind of person who will come into the next conservative administration is going to be governed by one principle, and that is Destroying the grasp that political elites and unelected technocrats have over the average person.
[00:58:38.775 --> 00:58:43.077]  We're going to change instead of using a needle to use a little patch.
[00:58:43.217 --> 00:58:48.680]  So the pandemic really highlighted that we've been underinvested in those innovations.
[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:50.381]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:58:51.461 --> 00:58:53.342]  All right, we are beating the globalists.
[00:58:53.382 --> 00:58:57.844]  That is a true statement because they can't carry out their operations and people understand they're the ones behind it.
[00:58:58.204 --> 00:58:59.525]  They're supposed to be the saviors.
[00:59:00.458 --> 00:59:04.821]  But they can't stop running their mouths how they're actually creating the crises because they think you're so stupid.
[00:59:05.922 --> 00:59:08.824]  But now they're learning you're not as dumb as they said you were.
[00:59:09.164 --> 00:59:10.125]  You were just asleep.
[00:59:10.825 --> 00:59:11.726]  Big difference.
[00:59:11.806 --> 00:59:13.868]  So I played a bunch of clips yesterday.
[00:59:13.948 --> 00:59:15.028]  There's a bunch of new clips.
[00:59:15.469 --> 00:59:22.234]  But I want to mix some of the new clips because it just ended with some of the clips I played that unfold the last few days.
[00:59:22.694 --> 00:59:26.557]  So here's a big Swiss banker with the World Economic Forum.
[00:59:28.186 --> 00:59:32.101]  Hubert Kellen saying, well, hear it for yourself.
[00:59:32.987 --> 00:59:36.109]  We'll be having our coffee before the session, and you raised the coffee example.
[00:59:36.169 --> 00:59:38.931]  I'd love just to give you the chance to expand on that.
[00:59:39.812 --> 00:59:47.797]  Basically, the coffee that we all drink emits between 15 and 20 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of coffee.
[00:59:48.557 --> 00:59:50.118]  So, we should all know that.
[00:59:50.519 --> 00:59:55.122]  This is every time we drink coffee, we are basically putting CO2 into the atmosphere.
[00:59:56.243 --> 01:00:02.667]  And one of the reasons is because most of the coffee plantations, or most of the coffee is produced through monoculture.
[01:00:03.968 --> 01:00:07.832]  And monoculture is also affected by climate change.
[01:00:09.134 --> 01:00:13.439]  The quality of these nature assets is deteriorating quite rapidly.
[01:00:13.459 --> 01:00:21.327]  Alright, so it always continues, it's always the same story.
[01:00:21.367 --> 01:00:27.728]   Anything popular, anything that the people want, Anything that's a commodity, they're going to say it's bad.
[01:00:27.768 --> 01:00:32.351]  They want to restrict rice because it puts off methane as it grows in swamp water.
[01:00:32.791 --> 01:00:34.772]  It's a power grab over everything.
[01:00:35.193 --> 01:00:38.935]  But then they'll have the global social credit score that's the vaccine passport system.
[01:00:39.255 --> 01:00:42.598]  It's the carbon tax system that will tax every item accordingly.
[01:00:43.999 --> 01:00:46.901]  And then of course, they'll give their own companies that produce it the right way.
[01:00:49.068 --> 01:00:50.129]  A pass on the taxes.
[01:00:50.329 --> 01:00:55.634]  It's a way to totally consolidate what's left of the economy that these people don't already control.
[01:00:56.215 --> 01:00:58.337]  And the name of the game is control.
[01:00:58.677 --> 01:01:05.664]  Here's the Queen of the Netherlands explaining why we need these central bank digital currencies.
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:07.760]  Why?
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:10.281]  Because in order to open an account, you need to have an ID.
[01:01:10.641 --> 01:01:10.821]  Right.
[01:01:11.282 --> 01:01:21.626]  And I have to say that when I started this job, there were actually very little countries in Africa or Latin America that had one ubiquitous type of ID.
[01:01:21.726 --> 01:01:23.307]  And certainly that it was digital.
[01:01:23.867 --> 01:01:25.228]  And certainly that it was biometric.
[01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:31.491]  And we've really worked with all our partners to actually help that being, I mean, to grow this.
[01:01:32.211 --> 01:01:38.756]  And the interesting part of it is that, you know, yes, it is very necessary for financial services, but not only.
[01:01:38.776 --> 01:01:41.698]  It's also good for school enrollment.
[01:01:42.078 --> 01:01:45.321]  It's also good for health who actually got a vaccination or not.
[01:01:46.081 --> 01:01:49.644]  It's very good to actually to get your subsidies, you know, from the government.
[01:01:50.304 --> 01:01:53.587]  So this has not only effect to the financial services.
[01:01:53.647 --> 01:01:54.888]  It's a very important issue.
[01:01:57.085 --> 01:01:58.586]  That's the key to running your entire life.
[01:01:59.046 --> 01:02:01.688]  Here's the head of the Saudi Arabian Central Bank.
[01:02:01.948 --> 01:02:02.889]  Here's what he had to say about it.
[01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:13.535]  There is no realistic solution to the climate transition that does not involve a globally coordinated system of carbon taxes.
[01:02:14.636 --> 01:02:16.557]  There's no realistic or fair solution.
[01:02:17.156 --> 01:02:20.537]  That does not involve a globally coordinated system of carbon taxes.
[01:02:20.597 --> 01:02:25.319]  And Ngozi at the WTO is coordinating this with several other international organizations.
[01:02:25.899 --> 01:02:26.900]  It's still early days.
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:31.722]  There's a perception that it's unjust, it's unfair, it'll lead to inflation.
[01:02:32.522 --> 01:02:34.203]  In fact, quite the contrary.
[01:02:35.903 --> 01:02:42.646]  If we don't do this, the countries that will suffer most ultimately are the developing countries.
[01:02:42.846 --> 01:02:45.067]  They're going to be the worst affected by climate change.
[01:02:46.033 --> 01:02:50.755]  If we don't do this, it's ordinary vulnerable communities that will suffer the most.
[01:02:51.316 --> 01:03:07.423]  What we need is a system of carbon taxes, coupled with subsidies for vulnerable households, and a stream of funding for the developing world to allow them to engage in investments in mitigation and adaptation that allows them to keep growing.
[01:03:07.843 --> 01:03:09.084]  And that's a real opportunity.
[01:03:09.624 --> 01:03:15.047]  It's a fair solution, and it's the only realistic solution, and we can't keep ducking it.
[01:03:16.301 --> 01:03:17.883]  Oh, we can't keep ducking it.
[01:03:19.745 --> 01:03:21.306]  Oh, there's going to be all this scarcity.
[01:03:21.326 --> 01:03:22.187]  We need to innovate.
[01:03:22.607 --> 01:03:28.373]  They're creating the scarcity, forcing you onto their economy that is literally a depopulation grid in their own words.
[01:03:28.994 --> 01:03:29.855]  You will eat the bugs.
[01:03:30.475 --> 01:03:39.945]  Here's the editor of the Wall Street Journal, Emma Tucker, bemoaning the fact that they used to have total mind control over the people, but now they're awake.
[01:03:41.087 --> 01:03:46.230]  If you go back really not that long ago, as I say, we owned the news.
[01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:49.852]  We were the gatekeepers and we very much owned the facts as well.
[01:03:50.092 --> 01:03:53.594]  If it said it in the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, then that was a fact.
[01:03:54.334 --> 01:04:00.798]  Nowadays, people can go to all sorts of different sources for the news and they're much more questioning about what we're saying.
[01:04:01.258 --> 01:04:07.381]  So, it's no longer good enough for us just to say, this is what happened or this is the news.
[01:04:07.461 --> 01:04:10.003]  We have to explain, almost like explain our working.
[01:04:10.683 --> 01:04:14.186]  So readers expect to understand how we source stories.
[01:04:14.626 --> 01:04:18.849]  They want to know how we go about getting stories.
[01:04:19.210 --> 01:04:27.296]  We have to sort of lift the bonnet, as it were, and in a way that newspapers, you know, aren't used to doing, and explain to people what we're doing.
[01:04:27.336 --> 01:04:30.678]  We need to be much more transparent about how we go about collecting the news.
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:36.523]  Now I want to explain something here, and I know the listeners are smart, but I want this to really sink in.
[01:04:38.479 --> 01:04:43.742]  When they get the cashless society, central bank digital currencies in that they're rolling out now, there's major resistance.
[01:04:45.043 --> 01:04:47.064]  They already control 88% of the wealth in the world.
[01:04:48.685 --> 01:04:51.406]  But even the bigger companies are still selling people what they want.
[01:04:51.707 --> 01:04:54.968]  This is about not letting those companies sell what they want or what you want.
[01:04:55.609 --> 01:04:57.710]  But to do that, they've got to shut everybody else down.
[01:04:58.010 --> 01:05:07.918]   Because if the big companies stop selling you beef, and you know, things you want, and things that are good, and rice and coffee, They'll just go to somebody else, you see.
[01:05:07.938 --> 01:05:11.621]  That's why they admit they want to basically outlaw all this, except for themselves.
[01:05:12.061 --> 01:05:13.503]  It'll be extremely expensive.
[01:05:14.423 --> 01:05:16.945]  So it's the perfect plan for total control.
[01:05:18.967 --> 01:05:25.652]  But if we simply stop shopping with the big boys now, as much as we can, none of us are perfect.
[01:05:25.932 --> 01:05:28.935]  There's a lot of stuff you can't find anywhere but from a big company now.
[01:05:29.875 --> 01:05:35.340]  But if we start really researching where we spend our money, that's where the power, that's where the real vote is, more than in these elections.
[01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:39.923]  You can then build the independent new system.
[01:05:40.763 --> 01:05:45.065]  And there's nothing more illustrative than that, than a graphic I saw yesterday.
[01:05:45.085 --> 01:05:49.547]  I'm at the show last night, but I forgot to tell the crew to have it today, but it showed a house.
[01:05:50.928 --> 01:05:55.550]  And next to it is a greenhouse that's as big as the house, connected to the house.
[01:05:56.271 --> 01:06:00.032]  And the headline was, what our goals for our homes should all be.
[01:06:00.052 --> 01:06:02.133]  And it really is true.
[01:06:03.034 --> 01:06:04.835]  Everybody should try to get in a position.
[01:06:05.731 --> 01:06:06.512]  To be able to garden.
[01:06:06.692 --> 01:06:09.254]  Or have skills you can barter with a garden.
[01:06:09.274 --> 01:06:17.541]  Because at the end of the day, the world they're building, they'll be defeated if we simply start growing gardens and gathering the seeds and doing it again and again and again.
[01:06:18.461 --> 01:06:21.144]  That's something that is impossible for them to defeat.
[01:06:21.864 --> 01:06:25.147]  Just like if we support new independent media it becomes the dominant media.
[01:06:26.206 --> 01:06:33.710]  Whether it's Tucker Carlson or Joe Rogan or Alex Jones or any of the others, we're the big media now and we have way bigger numbers than corporate media.
[01:06:33.850 --> 01:06:46.898]  They now admit that, so they're in this paradox right now where they know they've lost the power, they know the people are against them, but they've stolen all the money and they're trying to figure out a way to get us to go back under their control.
[01:06:48.871 --> 01:06:53.514]  And again, if you just tuned in, the globalists admit we're losing, everybody hates us, what do we do?
[01:06:54.054 --> 01:06:58.777]  And they say, well, war's coming and cyber attacks and all these crises.
[01:06:59.477 --> 01:07:03.619]  If they make things bad enough, they still think you'll forget that they're the ones behind it.
[01:07:03.779 --> 01:07:04.680]  That's never going to happen.
[01:07:05.677 --> 01:07:09.101]  There's no putting that genie back in the bottle.
[01:07:09.661 --> 01:07:18.231]  All right, I want to give the toll-free number out to talk about the WEF, to talk about all their evil announcements and what you think should be done and where you think we're going from here.
[01:07:18.671 --> 01:07:25.499]  I'd like to get your take on do you think it's as important as I think it is because it really is amazing and I think it's undoubtable that it's incredibly important.
[01:07:25.979 --> 01:07:31.804]  That now the main issue in the world is the globalists and how they've set up this evil system.
[01:07:32.124 --> 01:07:33.645]  That is such a benchmark.
[01:07:33.685 --> 01:07:46.296]  That is such an achievement of all of us together that I really think we should celebrate that we've come this far because we're really now openly discussing things with them and they're now starting to admit, oh, you don't want our world government?
[01:07:46.676 --> 01:07:47.296]  Oh, you hate us?
[01:07:48.177 --> 01:07:51.322]  That doesn't mean they're going to go away, but it's a big deal.
[01:07:51.923 --> 01:07:56.129]  They've been in trouble for decades, but now they're admitting they're on their last legs.
[01:07:56.189 --> 01:07:57.050]  This is a big deal.
[01:07:58.051 --> 01:07:58.993]  What do you think comes next?
[01:07:59.413 --> 01:08:01.637]  How do they try to grab Victor from the jaws of defeat?
[01:08:02.844 --> 01:08:03.425]  Toll-free number 877-789-2539.
[01:08:03.445 --> 01:08:03.485]  877-789-2539.
[01:08:03.505 --> 01:08:06.127]  First-time callers, long-time callers, agree, disagree?
[01:08:06.147 --> 01:08:09.710]  All we ask is you've got a clean phone line, tell us who you're calling from.
[01:08:09.730 --> 01:08:09.790]  877-789-2539.
[01:08:09.810 --> 01:08:10.791]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:08:10.811 --> 01:08:11.091]  877-789-Alex.
[01:08:11.531 --> 01:08:12.052]  Infowars.com.
[01:08:12.072 --> 01:08:12.472]  Newswars.com.
[01:08:12.492 --> 01:08:12.893]  Band.video.
[01:08:12.733 --> 01:08:20.172]   tell us who you're calling from 877-789-2539. I'm your host Alex Jones 877-789-Alex,
[01:08:20.172 --> 01:08:24.972]   Infowars.com, Newswars.com, Bandod Video. We'll be right back.
[01:08:24.972 --> 01:08:33.452]  I'm a pioneer.
[01:08:33.674 --> 01:08:34.654]  I'm an explorer!
[01:08:36.014 --> 01:08:36.694]  I'm a human!
[01:08:36.914 --> 01:08:38.795]  And I'm coming!
[01:08:39.535 --> 01:08:40.235]  I'm animated!
[01:08:40.595 --> 01:08:41.236]  I'm alive!
[01:08:41.396 --> 01:08:42.276]  My heart's big!
[01:08:42.516 --> 01:08:43.476]  It's got hot blood!
[01:08:43.676 --> 01:08:44.997]  Going through it fast!
[01:08:46.057 --> 01:08:47.317]  I like to fight, too!
[01:08:48.358 --> 01:08:49.098]  I like to eat!
[01:08:49.818 --> 01:08:50.918]  I like to have children!
[01:08:52.719 --> 01:08:53.179]  I'm here!
[01:08:54.697 --> 01:08:55.478]  I've got a life force!
[01:08:55.518 --> 01:08:56.398]  This is a human!
[01:08:56.458 --> 01:08:57.559]  This is what we look like!
[01:08:57.659 --> 01:08:58.779]  This is what we act like!
[01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:00.821]  This is what everybody was like before us!
[01:09:01.201 --> 01:09:02.081]  This is what I am!
[01:09:02.281 --> 01:09:02.982]  I'm a throwback!
[01:09:03.242 --> 01:09:03.702]  I'm here!
[01:09:04.082 --> 01:09:05.583]  I've got the fire of human liberty!
[01:09:05.763 --> 01:09:07.084]  I'm setting fires everywhere!
[01:09:07.324 --> 01:09:08.885]  And humans are turning on everywhere!
[01:09:09.185 --> 01:09:11.186]  Get behind me, Satan!
[01:09:12.787 --> 01:09:13.968]  Down with the devil!
[01:09:15.168 --> 01:09:16.049]  This can't be.
[01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:17.950]  Arthur, you're playing the wrong message.
[01:09:17.770 --> 01:09:21.770]  visit Infowars.com/show today.
[01:09:21.770 --> 01:09:34.770]  [music]
[01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:37.770]   Alright, we're going to your phone calls and interspersing with masses of news.
[01:09:38.290 --> 01:09:56.615]  Ahead of Michael Yon joining us from the Darien Gap on the border of South America going into Central America where the UN and the Chinese along with US funding are building bridges, giant roads, you name it, and huge refugee camps to accelerate the invasion.
[01:09:57.956 --> 01:10:05.469]   But I like to go back sometimes And give you a blast from the past.
[01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:27.121]  Here's a video from a year and a half ago with the disgusting Prince William, King Charles' son, who's embraced the WF and the whole UN World Government agenda, and his wife, saying, go get your shots and don't listen to people that tell you they're not safe.
[01:10:28.922 --> 01:10:43.621]   Meanwhile, they're cutting off the carbon To the people, and they admit in the British News nearly 5,000 Brits froze to death last year due to heating costs.
[01:10:44.581 --> 01:10:55.705]  So they heat all their palaces and the rest of it, but with all the carbon cuts they've done and the shutting down the coal plants, 5,000 people, upwards of that, starved to death.
[01:10:55.725 --> 01:10:59.887]  I just want you to remember what all this cutting off the energy and cutting off the food does.
[01:11:00.868 --> 01:11:03.909]  If you think it's bad in the first world, you have not seen anything yet.
[01:11:05.329 --> 01:11:06.409]  These are real feudalists.
[01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:13.271]  And his ancestors, all over Europe, they're European royalty, not even British.
[01:11:14.231 --> 01:11:16.672]  With King George I, the British line was taken over.
[01:11:17.252 --> 01:11:21.053]  That itself was Norman line, from William the Conqueror, but it's a side issue.
[01:11:22.013 --> 01:11:27.394]  They did this all over Europe, keeping people on small pieces of land at starvation level to control them.
[01:11:28.854 --> 01:11:35.736]  And that's all they're doing is bringing back feudalism and smiling at us when they're not at Jeffrey Epstein's Island raping children.
[01:11:36.857 --> 01:11:40.558]  Or his dad's not hanging out with Jimmy Savelle raping children.
[01:11:41.479 --> 01:11:42.799]  And I'm just sick of them.
[01:11:42.859 --> 01:11:43.759]  It's disgusting.
[01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:45.160]  It's sycophantic.
[01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:48.941]  It's out of control.
[01:11:50.062 --> 01:11:56.284]  And I've watched people I've known that have supposedly fought the globalists.
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:01.984]  Literally be invited by these people to go to parties with them, and they stop fighting the New World Order.
[01:12:02.944 --> 01:12:06.167]  And they think they've arrived socially because they're hanging out with royalty.
[01:12:06.888 --> 01:12:14.594]  There's nothing more uncool than royalty, especially if you're an American, because we're the country that overthrew it, started stopping it, and created a world trend.
[01:12:16.135 --> 01:12:17.777]  So, just truly sick.
[01:12:18.377 --> 01:12:23.862]  So, here's a clip of this leering gargoyle telling you to take the poison shot.
[01:12:24.102 --> 01:12:25.243]  So now the blood's on his hands.
[01:12:26.035 --> 01:12:34.841]  Catherine and I are not medical experts by any means, but if it's any consolation, we can wholeheartedly support having vaccinations.
[01:12:35.241 --> 01:12:36.101]  It's really, really important.
[01:12:36.121 --> 01:12:41.004]  We've spoken to a lot of people about it and the uptake's been amazing so far.
[01:12:41.024 --> 01:12:47.008]  We've got to keep it going so that the younger generations also feel that it's really important for them to have it.
[01:12:47.148 --> 01:13:06.140]   It must be really daunting, especially At the beginning, you know, with the warnings out there for those with asthma and underlying health conditions and things like that, with the uncertainty of not knowing what it was about the pandemic that was going to be a sort of a threat or a complication.
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:19.348]  Social media is awash sometimes with lots of rumours and misinformation, so we have to be a little bit careful who we believe and where we get our information from, but especially for those who are clinically vulnerable as well, it's so important that those vaccinations are done.
[01:13:21.255 --> 01:13:24.317]  So, we've got the Queen of the Netherlands out there saying the same crap.
[01:13:25.317 --> 01:13:27.758]  And she wants a cashless society to force you to take shots.
[01:13:27.798 --> 01:13:28.659]  They're up there saying it.
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:34.341]  And of course his grandfather, Prince Philip, said he wants to kill 80% of the world's population.
[01:13:34.361 --> 01:13:37.763]  Just search Prince Philip, destroy, kill 80% of the population.
[01:13:38.103 --> 01:13:39.364]  He gave a whole bunch of interviews.
[01:13:39.604 --> 01:13:41.765]  Autobahn Society, AP, Reuters.
[01:13:42.505 --> 01:13:43.466]  He wrote books about it.
[01:13:47.276 --> 01:13:51.279]  It just goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on.
[01:13:55.402 --> 01:13:56.283]  That's who we're up against.
[01:13:56.343 --> 01:13:57.704]  I see we've got loaded phone lines.
[01:13:59.205 --> 01:14:00.506]  And we're gonna go to break here in a few minutes.
[01:14:00.526 --> 01:14:02.367]  When we come back, I'm gonna go right to your calls.
[01:14:02.387 --> 01:14:05.849]  We'll skip that break coming up, so we'll have a whole 30 minutes to get to everybody on the board.
[01:14:05.890 --> 01:14:14.376]  I'm gonna move quick through Cassandra, and Hulkman, and Jimmy, and Shawn, and Michael, and Angie, and Bart, Curtis, Tanner, Malachi, and Arnold.
[01:14:14.416 --> 01:14:15.697]  That'll be the calls we take today.
[01:14:16.465 --> 01:14:20.486]  Ahead of Michael Young joining us from Southern Central America.
[01:14:20.506 --> 01:14:29.909]  You've got a real opportunity here to be part of the real revolution for the human future.
[01:14:31.109 --> 01:14:35.250]  And there's nowhere that you can spread the word about the show or support the show.
[01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:41.912]  There's nowhere where you can get behind something where it's going to have a bigger effect.
[01:14:41.972 --> 01:14:42.412]  It's just true.
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:47.117]  And that's all God's work, so I'm just asking listeners.
[01:14:49.687 --> 01:15:12.067]  The vast majority of which have never gotten a product at InfoWarsTore.com to realize how much we can do with more reporters and more shows and more researchers and more investigative reporters and writers if you simply start deciding to do a little less shopping at Walmart, a little less shopping at Amazon, which literally ought to get you, and a little more shopping to get amazing things at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:15:12.287 --> 01:15:13.288]  But that's a decision you've got to make.
[01:15:13.328 --> 01:15:15.690]  But I've got to tell you, if you don't, you're really missing out.
[01:15:16.351 --> 01:15:19.333]  Because you see our information is informative and cutting edge.
[01:15:19.913 --> 01:15:27.879]  Every product we've got, whether it's water filtration, gravity fed stainless steel water filtration, portable or in your house, you name it.
[01:15:28.559 --> 01:15:31.561]  It's one of the highest rated systems out there at the lowest price.
[01:15:33.402 --> 01:15:33.683]  Boom!
[01:15:33.843 --> 01:15:35.124]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:15:35.564 --> 01:15:36.585]  The Alexa Pure System.
[01:15:37.605 --> 01:15:39.106]  And their air filtration is amazing as well.
[01:15:42.328 --> 01:15:44.350]  And then we've got the supplements.
[01:15:46.195 --> 01:15:49.056]  Right now we have a big special, the Supercharged Special, even though it's selling out.
[01:15:49.396 --> 01:15:55.219]  DNA Force Plus and Real Red Pill Plus that go together so good for your telomeres, your DNA, your cell health, cleaning out your blood.
[01:15:55.839 --> 01:16:00.602]  That is 50% off when you get them together, 40% off individually.
[01:16:00.622 --> 01:16:02.603]  You're like, well, why are you discounting it if you're almost sold out?
[01:16:02.663 --> 01:16:03.723]  Because we need the funds now.
[01:16:05.904 --> 01:16:07.325]  So this is a win-win situation.
[01:16:07.345 --> 01:16:08.965]  The only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[01:16:09.026 --> 01:16:10.026]  Infowarshore.com.
[01:16:10.186 --> 01:16:12.147]  And I mentioned this earlier, but only for like 10 seconds.
[01:16:12.747 --> 01:16:13.848]  I really want you to listen to me.

[01:16:31.357 --> 01:16:36.902]  Like that famous, best-selling ever, original Super Blue toothpaste.

[01:16:47.704 --> 01:16:51.085]   You'll use this, you only need like a quarter of the amount of regular toothpaste.
[01:16:51.085 --> 01:16:51.904]  You're gonna be blown away.

[01:17:10.604 --> 01:17:12.965]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's happening.
[01:17:13.208 --> 01:17:25.398]  Two years in the making, and we didn't plan it like this because we didn't know, to release Alex Jones New World Order Wars that's all about fighting Epstein, and Clinton, and Hillary, and the Deep State, and the pedo rings.
[01:17:25.518 --> 01:17:29.702]  Whole levels just dealing with that because that's the truth how they operate.
[01:17:29.982 --> 01:17:34.146]  And now the game went on Steam, the biggest online platform of video games in the world.
[01:17:34.166 --> 01:17:34.986]  150 million users a week.
[01:17:37.268 --> 01:17:39.169]  And it already shot to number one.
[01:17:39.449 --> 01:17:48.092]  So find the link to Steam at AlexJonesGame.com or search Alex Jones New World Order Wars at Steam and get it for yourself.

[01:17:52.974 --> 01:17:57.036]  We'll put the link to Steam on screen and to AlexJonesGame.com.
[01:17:57.416 --> 01:17:58.276]  Get it there.
[01:17:58.516 --> 01:17:59.877]  We are taking back the culture.
[01:17:59.917 --> 01:18:00.937]  We are taking things back.
[01:18:01.237 --> 01:18:04.038]  This will fund the Info War, going into the election in the next 10 months.
[01:18:04.458 --> 01:18:06.179]  The only way we fail is if we don't take action.
[01:18:06.038 --> 01:18:09.038]  and get New World Order Wars by Alex Jones now.
[01:18:10.038 --> 01:18:13.038]   Alright, I'm about to go right to your phone calls for the rest of the hour.
[01:18:13.038 --> 01:18:17.038]   Then Michael Yeun with massive, biggest news yet on the border.
[01:18:17.038 --> 01:18:21.038]   It just gets more insane, because the world gets more insane every day.
[01:18:21.038 --> 01:18:23.038]  I wish it was getting less insane. It's not.
[01:18:23.659 --> 01:18:25.100]  But I want to just make a quick program note.
[01:18:25.161 --> 01:18:27.502]  I've been realizing I need to make probably every hour for a while.
[01:18:27.923 --> 01:18:31.205]  We have millions of people now a day watching us on ex-formerly Twitter.
[01:18:32.386 --> 01:18:34.047]  And I see this constant complaint.
[01:18:35.348 --> 01:18:38.710]  Hey, why are there, you know, 10 minutes of ads an hour?
[01:18:40.412 --> 01:18:47.176]  Well, the same reason if you listen to Rush Limbaugh before he died, he had 14 minutes of ads an hour.
[01:18:47.417 --> 01:18:48.978]  That's the talk radio clock.
[01:18:50.379 --> 01:18:54.502]  And if you watch Fox News, they've got 14 minutes of ads an hour.
[01:18:55.743 --> 01:18:57.385]  During big news events, sometimes more.
[01:18:58.346 --> 01:19:04.751]  Because half the ads go to local stations, and half the ads go to the network.
[01:19:04.831 --> 01:19:06.252]  That's the network system.
[01:19:06.993 --> 01:19:08.153]  So I've been on air 30 years.
[01:19:08.214 --> 01:19:09.435]  I guess I'm an old man now.
[01:19:09.495 --> 01:19:10.215]  Almost 30 years.
[01:19:11.216 --> 01:19:13.077]  Since I was 20 years old.
[01:19:14.198 --> 01:19:15.640]  I'm 50 next month.
[01:19:16.576 --> 01:19:25.047]  So, I'm still on a bunch of radio stations, and when they deplatformed me five years ago, off of everything about InfoWars.com, we stayed on air, barely.
[01:19:27.452 --> 01:19:53.091]  Because I sold my savings and everything I had as backup, wasn't that much, and we were on a lot of radio stations, and then we could tell people where to find us on those, to spread the word, so the talk radio listeners told their friends and family around the country and the world, tune in to the Forbidden Show at InfoWars.com, so we got over a million people tuning in on the internet, at least a day there, and then people shared the clips to five or six million off of that.
[01:19:54.412 --> 01:19:55.693]  That's a conservative guesstimation.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.161]  Some days bigger, some days smaller, usually bigger.
[01:19:59.181 --> 01:20:04.444]  But, yeah, we went from reaching 25, 30 million people a day before they de-platformed us.
[01:20:04.464 --> 01:20:07.345]  We were number one, bigger than Limbaugh was, bigger than Joe Rogan.
[01:20:07.365 --> 01:20:07.966]  Joe's admitted that.
[01:20:07.986 --> 01:20:08.806]  It's not about who's the biggest.
[01:20:08.866 --> 01:20:09.266]  It's true.
[01:20:09.507 --> 01:20:10.467]  Biggest thing there was for a while.
[01:20:10.907 --> 01:20:11.668]  That's when they came after me.
[01:20:13.289 --> 01:20:17.831]  You know, we've had ABC, Wall Street Journal headlines, Alex Jones reaching 37 million people a day.
[01:20:17.871 --> 01:20:18.811]  He's got to be silenced.
[01:20:19.012 --> 01:20:19.212]  Yeah.
[01:20:20.825 --> 01:20:26.667]  So, now we're back, thanks to X, conservatively reaching 10 million extra people today.
[01:20:27.127 --> 01:20:30.648]  On top of the 5 million or so we reach over Infowars.com and radio stations.
[01:20:31.048 --> 01:20:32.729]  Those are very conservative numbers, alright?
[01:20:34.829 --> 01:20:36.010]  We reached about 20 million today.
[01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:38.791]  And I see it everywhere.
[01:20:38.891 --> 01:20:39.991]  Man, why are there ads?
[01:20:40.071 --> 01:20:43.372]  Because I'm on the traditional media.
[01:20:44.192 --> 01:20:45.013]  This is a show.
[01:20:45.053 --> 01:20:46.293]  Now, what have I done?
[01:20:47.833 --> 01:20:50.675]  I've been skipping almost all the network breaks.
[01:20:52.137 --> 01:20:56.521]  And the network breaks are at 15 after and 45 after.
[01:20:57.261 --> 01:21:03.887]  All the other breaks at the middle of the hour and at the start of the hour, those are local stations.
[01:21:03.907 --> 01:21:06.649]  We're not getting rid of those because they've got to pay their bills.
[01:21:07.970 --> 01:21:11.193]  That's how they pay for the tower and their crew and their people.
[01:21:12.494 --> 01:21:18.619]   So, I have basically phased out The network breaks, and then I've got to do plugs.
[01:21:18.659 --> 01:21:20.539]  That's all we've got is what I say live on air.
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:21.320]  All right?
[01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:27.162]  So, that's why everybody else could be canceled but us because we were still on talk radio.
[01:21:28.923 --> 01:21:30.463]  And they went after the stations and harassed them.
[01:21:30.683 --> 01:21:49.906]   And the great part about the stations, because they're red-blooded Americans, almost all of them, I got so many calls instead of John Harmon, the program director, like, we've had you on at midnight for five years, you get us decent ratings, but They called up and threatened to blow up the radio station the left has been calling and we don't take you off so we're putting you on prime time.
[01:21:50.887 --> 01:21:51.727]  Or stuff like that.
[01:21:51.847 --> 01:21:57.409]  I mean, it's like, the folks on talk radio stations, the mom and pops, are not the people you want to threaten.
[01:21:57.449 --> 01:22:05.372]  I mean, I don't want to tell the left to do it, but it has the opposite effect with old-fashioned Americans when you threaten them.
[01:22:05.392 --> 01:22:06.493]  You tend to get the opposite.
[01:22:08.268 --> 01:22:10.110]  Because in the lawsuit, they got a list of our affiliates.
[01:22:10.170 --> 01:22:12.392]  I've never published them because they would harass them.
[01:22:12.992 --> 01:22:16.055]  They got them, they subpoenaed them, they harassed the living snot out of them.
[01:22:16.556 --> 01:22:19.498]  And we actually got more airtime and better slots out of it.
[01:22:19.779 --> 01:22:20.980]  A few stations got scared.
[01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:26.164]  Some that were corporate-owned, 50,000 water, and you know, Sacramento, and Giant.
[01:22:26.225 --> 01:22:29.027]  I mean, probably 500,000 listeners a day just off that.
[01:22:29.307 --> 01:22:29.988]  They took that away.
[01:22:30.008 --> 01:22:31.710]  I mean, they took us off New York.
[01:22:31.730 --> 01:22:32.791]  I mean, they took some stuff.
[01:22:33.690 --> 01:22:35.231]  But it's been one hell of a fight.
[01:22:35.331 --> 01:22:43.033]  So, yeah, I do intend, and I've been doing some of it, to do a commercial-free podcast.
[01:22:44.454 --> 01:22:51.156]  I'm just so busy running around trying to find money to fund this thing that I spent half my time trying to raise funds.
[01:22:52.202 --> 01:22:58.727]  So I want to get in a position where there's plenty of money so I can do the special podcasts, the special interviews with no commercials.
[01:22:58.767 --> 01:22:59.668]  And I've been doing a lot of those.
[01:22:59.968 --> 01:23:00.568]  At least one a week.
[01:23:00.589 --> 01:23:01.890]  But I want to do them like five days a week.
[01:23:02.530 --> 01:23:03.150]  I'm trying.
[01:23:03.191 --> 01:23:04.331]  I'm trying to do the show with Crowder.
[01:23:04.351 --> 01:23:05.292]  I'm trying here, folks.
[01:23:05.913 --> 01:23:07.514]  And I got more interviews than I can ever do.
[01:23:07.614 --> 01:23:09.696]  I'm busier than a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest.
[01:23:10.806 --> 01:23:12.087]  I get pissed at myself sometimes.
[01:23:12.147 --> 01:23:17.649]  It's like 9 at night, an interview's set, and I gotta call the interviewer up and say, I know you're a big show.
[01:23:17.829 --> 01:23:18.650]  I can barely talk.
[01:23:18.810 --> 01:23:19.510]  I just can't do it.
[01:23:20.010 --> 01:23:21.011]  I used to have unlimited energy.
[01:23:21.091 --> 01:23:21.631]  I'm older now.
[01:23:22.252 --> 01:23:27.854]  I mean, that's why I look at Trump at 77, 78, and they'll show footage of him at 3 a.m.
[01:23:27.934 --> 01:23:28.414]  coming in.
[01:23:28.795 --> 01:23:31.476]  He sleeps two hours, and then they go, oh, look, he's dragging his feet.
[01:23:32.556 --> 01:23:35.658]  Yeah, I told Roger Stone last night, we need to cut that out.
[01:23:36.494 --> 01:23:40.518]  I mean, when I was 25, 30 years old, I could work 18 hours a day for weeks on end.
[01:23:41.479 --> 01:23:42.620]  Trump's Superman, folks.
[01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:44.282]  Just because of that, my respect for him.
[01:23:44.562 --> 01:23:47.064]  I've been watching his schedule.
[01:23:47.084 --> 01:23:47.845]  20 hour days?
[01:23:47.865 --> 01:23:51.909]  I mean, this is Conan the Barbarian stuff.
[01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:53.250]  This is Superman stuff.
[01:23:54.271 --> 01:23:55.993]  And it's not smart.
[01:23:56.593 --> 01:23:59.556]  Trump's biggest enemy is himself, and he needs to put the brakes on.
[01:24:00.037 --> 01:24:00.697]  And I've learned how.
[01:24:01.846 --> 01:24:05.648]  I have some interviews set up at midnight on some huge show, international show.
[01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:09.809]  And most of the time I just say, I'm not doing it because I just can't.
[01:24:09.829 --> 01:24:14.311]  I already didn't see my kids a lot.
[01:24:14.351 --> 01:24:15.332]  You know, I've got four children.
[01:24:15.772 --> 01:24:18.673]  The last 10 years, I was there quite a bit, some when I could.
[01:24:18.733 --> 01:24:23.155]  I mean, quality time, but I wasn't there like I should have been.
[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:30.204]  I got my six-and-a-half-year-old daughter and I'm spending a lot of time with her because life's too short.
[01:24:30.945 --> 01:24:33.047]  But I'm pontificating.
[01:24:33.087 --> 01:24:33.828]  I said I'd take your calls.
[01:24:33.848 --> 01:24:35.210]  I'm sorry I'm going down a rabbit trail here.
[01:24:35.230 --> 01:24:38.393]  I'm just trying to explain to listeners how the cow ate the cabbage.
[01:24:38.733 --> 01:24:39.795]  All right, thank you for putting up with me.
[01:24:40.335 --> 01:24:41.997]  Let's go to Jimmy in North Carolina.
[01:24:42.057 --> 01:24:42.758]  Jimmy, you're on the air.
[01:24:42.778 --> 01:24:43.078]  Go ahead.
[01:24:43.098 --> 01:24:43.619]  Thanks for calling.
[01:24:44.734 --> 01:24:45.435]  Yeah, hey Alex.
[01:24:45.675 --> 01:25:07.337]  I've been listening to you for a long, long time and, you know, I find it interesting you guys published or posted today an article of Johns Hopkins about their plans and their advice for preventing the Second American Revolution, which is really great to see you completely complying with one of the points on there and making sure that people just peacefully and politically resist their way right into the FEMA camps.
[01:25:08.044 --> 01:25:09.786]  So, um, keep up the stellar work.
[01:25:09.806 --> 01:25:15.953]  Hopefully you're not publishing or producing any more George Washington t-shirts because he probably would not be too happy with that.
[01:25:16.214 --> 01:25:17.796]  You know, I actually meant to cover that.
[01:25:17.816 --> 01:25:19.798]  Hold on, let me just talk and I'll let you go.
[01:25:19.838 --> 01:25:21.220]  I'll let you... Put him on hold.
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:21.740]  Put him on hold.
[01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:22.221]  Put him on hold.
[01:25:24.774 --> 01:25:25.835]  I'll let you talk here in a minute.
[01:25:26.635 --> 01:25:28.616]  That was in my stack, and I don't know where it is.
[01:25:29.057 --> 01:25:32.618]  Will you guys give me the John Hopkins article that's absolutely ridiculous?
[01:25:33.319 --> 01:25:36.981]  They say confiscating the guns will stop a revolution.
[01:25:37.601 --> 01:25:41.163]  Confiscating the guns will start a revolution, just like the one in 1776.
[01:25:42.164 --> 01:25:46.486]  So John Hopkins is one of the key brain trusts in the New World Order.
[01:25:46.846 --> 01:25:53.450]  They came out with a whole COVID lockdown plan, with the Rockefeller Foundation, Operation Lockstep, all of it.
[01:25:54.871 --> 01:25:55.852]  Sorry, go ahead sir.
[01:25:57.273 --> 01:26:00.236]  I'm just saying that you're obeying one of the points on there perfectly.
[01:26:00.617 --> 01:26:02.258]  You're spreading hopium.
[01:26:02.298 --> 01:26:16.813]  That's your job is to give hopium to the people that this tyrannical communist death row system is going to give up and relent and that they're going to cede power just because we're going to politically resist and peacefully resist ourselves straight into a FEMA camp.
[01:26:17.233 --> 01:26:26.661]  So you're doing great, you're obeying the Hopkins document they released, saying to make sure that they, that the people always spread information to always peacefully resist, right?
[01:26:26.701 --> 01:26:33.908]  So, again, if you're still making the George Washington t-shirts, I would advise you stop doing it, because he probably would be pissed, right?
[01:26:34.348 --> 01:26:36.370]  Okay, may I talk to you now?
[01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:38.031]  May I talk to you now?
[01:26:38.051 --> 01:26:39.553]  You're speaking both sides of your mouth.
[01:26:39.573 --> 01:26:40.413]  Alright, put him on hold again.
[01:26:40.433 --> 01:26:43.036]  I want to have a conversation, Jimmy.
[01:26:44.457 --> 01:26:45.498]  I want to have a conversation.
[01:26:45.518 --> 01:26:47.179]  So I'm going to bring you back up live.
[01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:49.421]  May we have a conversation?
[01:26:51.062 --> 01:26:51.302]  Sure.
[01:26:51.783 --> 01:26:52.083]  Okay.
[01:26:53.924 --> 01:26:58.088]  Jimmy, are you going to go out and attack and kill some people today?
[01:26:58.728 --> 01:26:59.849]  Tell me who we're supposed to attack.
[01:27:00.610 --> 01:27:02.251]  You're building a straw man there, buddy.
[01:27:03.406 --> 01:27:06.767]  Oh, I'm supposed to... Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[01:27:06.807 --> 01:27:07.467]  Put it back on hold.
[01:27:07.687 --> 01:27:08.207]  Put it back on hold.
[01:27:09.088 --> 01:27:14.309]  This John Hopkins document that I intended to cover that we put on Infowars.com, here it is, is ridiculous.
[01:27:15.309 --> 01:27:21.771]  Trying to take the guns in 1776 at Lexington and Concord is what triggered the Revolutionary War in 1775.
[01:27:24.312 --> 01:27:25.712]  And so this is preposterous.
[01:27:27.546 --> 01:27:33.409]  So you're saying I'm obeying John Hopkins because I don't want to go out and start a physical war.
[01:27:33.649 --> 01:27:35.610]  They had to provocateur January 6th.
[01:27:35.630 --> 01:27:38.591]  They had to stage Oklahoma City to demonize us as violent.
[01:27:38.811 --> 01:27:40.032]  We're winning hearts and minds.
[01:27:40.092 --> 01:27:41.032]  Trump's way ahead.
[01:27:41.613 --> 01:27:42.853]  The globalists are in trouble.
[01:27:42.873 --> 01:27:43.994]  They're being confronted everywhere.
[01:27:44.254 --> 01:27:45.194]  That's not hopium.
[01:27:46.275 --> 01:27:48.656]  They're ESG systems being defeated.
[01:27:49.448 --> 01:27:50.389]  They're in a lot of trouble.
[01:27:51.149 --> 01:27:52.470]  Doesn't mean the war's been won.
[01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:53.151]  I've said that.
[01:27:53.591 --> 01:28:00.677]  But that's not fair to sit there and call in and say you're complying saying be peaceful.
[01:28:00.797 --> 01:28:10.130]   I said I was the first person to go out and protest all over the country against the lockdowns and not wear a mask, and have preachers on that were getting arrested like Rodney Howard Brown.
[01:28:10.530 --> 01:28:14.394]  I said, don't let them take you to a camp, you have a right to defend yourself, which they're trying to set up.
[01:28:14.754 --> 01:28:19.858]  I am battling to cut the State Department funding of building the UN invasion camps.
[01:28:19.998 --> 01:28:27.244]  I'm going directly to the actual heart of things, and you call in, I mean, okay, if you're Alex Jones, what do you do?
[01:28:27.565 --> 01:28:28.646]  Teach me, Jimmy.
[01:28:28.946 --> 01:28:30.027]  Teach me what I'm supposed to do.
[01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:38.893]  I think, Alex, you've reached the end point of what your purpose has been.
[01:28:38.913 --> 01:28:42.355]  Alright, I don't think you're talking right on your telephone.
[01:28:42.395 --> 01:28:43.055]  Talk right into it.
[01:28:45.137 --> 01:28:48.359]  I think that your calling and your mission has run its course.
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:51.641]  Okay, I told you.
[01:28:51.681 --> 01:28:54.983]  Okay, so you're in command now, Jimmy.
[01:28:55.023 --> 01:28:55.543]  What do we do?
[01:28:56.384 --> 01:28:57.104]  You retire?
[01:28:57.124 --> 01:29:00.126]  Is what should happen.
[01:29:02.167 --> 01:29:02.988]  Good luck on that.
[01:29:05.371 --> 01:29:08.313]  I'm sure the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center, would be real happy, Jimmy.
[01:29:09.074 --> 01:29:10.395]  They're going to do what they're doing anyway.
[01:29:10.415 --> 01:29:11.535]  Nobody's stopping them, man.
[01:29:12.096 --> 01:29:13.457]  Trump's not going to stop anything.
[01:29:13.517 --> 01:29:15.438]  All of this is just a bunch of nonsense.
[01:29:16.779 --> 01:29:19.601]  Communism like this doesn't stop for anything.
[01:29:21.362 --> 01:29:25.124]  Well, look, you sound like Igor, or whatever his name is, from Winnie the Pooh.
[01:29:25.465 --> 01:29:26.185]  You guys know that.
[01:29:26.225 --> 01:29:27.386]  Communism doesn't stop.
[01:29:27.706 --> 01:29:29.788]  Is this Ray Epps calling in right now?
[01:29:29.828 --> 01:29:31.188]  It's an overwhelming force.
[01:29:31.849 --> 01:29:33.270]  See, there you go with your nonsense again.
[01:29:34.699 --> 01:29:34.979]  Right?
[01:29:35.159 --> 01:29:35.520]  I know.
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:39.903]  You call in saying, I'm not calling for offensive violence, so I'm bad.
[01:29:40.244 --> 01:29:43.266]  I'm calling out the fact that you speak from both sides of your mouth.
[01:29:43.426 --> 01:29:47.389]  You say that we're under assault, they're going to kill us all, they're killing our children and they're doing all of these things.
[01:29:48.010 --> 01:29:52.373]  But you're saying that we're just going to vote for Trump and that's our solution to everything.
[01:29:52.693 --> 01:29:53.754]  I appreciate your call.
[01:29:53.995 --> 01:29:54.755]  I appreciate your call.
[01:29:54.795 --> 01:29:56.036]  You're not listening to what I'm saying.
[01:29:56.757 --> 01:29:58.979]  I love all the guys in the comments on InfoWars.
[01:29:59.259 --> 01:30:01.641]  It's a minority of people, but Jones is a wimp.
[01:30:01.721 --> 01:30:02.942]  He needs to start killing people.
[01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:05.412]  Yeah, but you're not the one out there doing it.
[01:30:06.413 --> 01:30:08.075]  We have a good chance of beating this.
[01:30:08.696 --> 01:30:13.621]  I know almost all the other big talk show hosts are the dominant talk show hosts in the world, and they're against the globalists.
[01:30:14.602 --> 01:30:17.065]  And governments are turning our way, and we're electing populists.
[01:30:17.305 --> 01:30:18.647]  Doesn't mean there's going to be some utopia.
[01:30:18.687 --> 01:30:20.509]  We're a decadent evil species.
[01:30:20.889 --> 01:30:21.810]  We're also really good.
[01:30:22.090 --> 01:30:23.332]  We have both sides to it.
[01:30:24.272 --> 01:30:30.778]  And so, man, I'm just trying to be a good, decent person here and say, don't take these shots.
[01:30:30.818 --> 01:30:31.658]  They can really hurt you.
[01:30:32.019 --> 01:30:33.360]  Here's the evidence, day one.
[01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:48.773]  And I'm just here trying to fight the globalists and oppose their operations to secure our border and kick the pedophiles out of the public schools and kick the men out of women's sports and try to get the poisons out of our food and then try to stop the 5G.
[01:30:48.793 --> 01:30:50.935]  And you just say, oh, that ain't going to do it.
[01:30:51.195 --> 01:30:52.535]  Nothing ever stops communism.
[01:30:52.736 --> 01:30:55.236]  We've stopped communism all over the world over and over again.
[01:30:55.256 --> 01:30:59.278]  I don't know if you watch the Davos group, but they're crapping their britches.
[01:31:00.198 --> 01:31:01.118]  And they're doing it for real.
[01:31:01.198 --> 01:31:03.419]  You don't believe in humanity.
[01:31:05.159 --> 01:31:09.261]  And you say that I... Because I'm not... I mean, what is the target?
[01:31:10.521 --> 01:31:14.322]  If somebody shot Joe Biden or Barack Obama or Big Mike tomorrow, it'd make them stronger.
[01:31:14.802 --> 01:31:16.683]  We have to kill the ideas they promote.
[01:31:16.883 --> 01:31:19.584]  We have to annihilate their identity.
[01:31:21.715 --> 01:31:22.576]  Because they're criminals.
[01:31:22.956 --> 01:31:23.836]  They're not our saviors.
[01:31:24.617 --> 01:31:25.698]  And that's information war.
[01:31:25.738 --> 01:31:29.720]  The Pentagon will tell you 90 plus percent of war is information.
[01:31:30.701 --> 01:31:32.262]  And we're winning the information war.
[01:31:32.542 --> 01:31:39.066]  We just started to wake up the last few years and there's all these people want to shoot their mouths off about the info war.
[01:31:39.306 --> 01:31:42.809]  And I know you're pissed because that spirit in you, Jimmy, doesn't like the fact I haven't given up.
[01:31:43.209 --> 01:31:44.129]  Oh, I haven't given up.
[01:31:44.310 --> 01:31:45.570]  In fact, I'm winning, Jimmy.
[01:31:46.311 --> 01:31:47.612]  I'm everywhere, Jimmy.
[01:31:48.552 --> 01:31:50.734]  And people like me are everywhere, son.
[01:31:52.244 --> 01:31:54.925]  And you can kill my body, but you can't kill my spirit, brother.
[01:31:55.625 --> 01:31:58.265]  And I'm coming for you.
[01:32:00.406 --> 01:32:02.586]  So that spirit in you wants me to go away.
[01:32:03.646 --> 01:32:06.027]  I'll work a few extra hours just for you today, Jimmy.
[01:32:07.667 --> 01:32:08.327]  What a joke.
[01:32:10.448 --> 01:32:12.548]  That guy isn't going to do anything to anybody.
[01:32:13.548 --> 01:32:19.209]  He's going to sit there and tell other men how they stumbled, how they couldn't measure up to Jimmy's level.
[01:32:20.310 --> 01:32:21.910]  I wish I was as tough as you, Jimmy.
[01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:24.671]  You know me, I'm just all talk.
[01:32:24.530 --> 01:32:31.530]  I'm not tough at all.
[01:32:31.530 --> 01:32:32.650]  I love it when people like that calling.
[01:32:32.694 --> 01:32:33.914]  You just woke me up, son.
[01:32:34.654 --> 01:32:36.195]  Angie in Indiana, you're on the air.
[01:32:36.235 --> 01:32:36.575]  Welcome.
[01:32:36.615 --> 01:32:37.035]  Go ahead.
[01:32:38.376 --> 01:32:38.916]  Hi, Alex.
[01:32:39.356 --> 01:32:44.038]  I think what you had there was one of the patriot front pussies on your call there.
[01:32:44.118 --> 01:32:45.018]  That's what I was thinking.
[01:32:45.619 --> 01:32:47.199]  That's what I was thinking, too.
[01:32:47.239 --> 01:32:51.181]  He needs some alpha power to stand up for this country.
[01:32:52.026 --> 01:32:54.713]  It's guys like him that are ruining this country.
[01:32:55.768 --> 01:32:57.189]  I think he was upset.
[01:32:57.209 --> 01:32:57.930]  You think so?
[01:32:58.070 --> 01:33:00.532]  Alex Jones should stop exposing their whole agenda?
[01:33:01.172 --> 01:33:06.596]  We're gonna block every damn... We got laws being passed everywhere, blocking bugs in the food.
[01:33:06.916 --> 01:33:08.017]  Italy's passing laws.
[01:33:08.237 --> 01:33:10.859]  We're gonna block every damn bit of their agenda.
[01:33:11.039 --> 01:33:12.200]  We're starting to win!
[01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:16.483]  It's like we've been stuck in the mud, and now our tires are... we're almost out!
[01:33:16.864 --> 01:33:18.105]  And now we're coming out of the mud!
[01:33:18.125 --> 01:33:18.845]  He's like, wait, wait!
[01:33:19.085 --> 01:33:20.046]  Turn your engine off!
[01:33:20.266 --> 01:33:21.007]  You're losing!
[01:33:21.087 --> 01:33:22.868]  No, we're getting out of the mud!
[01:33:23.068 --> 01:33:24.189]  We're getting out of the ditch!
[01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.970]  Can't you see it?
[01:33:26.098 --> 01:33:27.159]  I can see it, Alex.
[01:33:27.279 --> 01:33:27.939]  I can see it.
[01:33:28.780 --> 01:33:29.220]  Keep going.
[01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:29.981]  Sorry, I'm ranting.
[01:33:30.701 --> 01:33:31.082]  No, no.
[01:33:31.122 --> 01:33:31.622]  You're fine.
[01:33:31.662 --> 01:33:32.142]  You're fine.
[01:33:32.463 --> 01:33:38.567]  I want to talk about the Anne Heche, the Helena Hutchins, Anthony Weiner laptop videos.
[01:33:38.687 --> 01:33:41.709]  And I want to know, is Frasier Drip, is that a real video?
[01:33:42.290 --> 01:33:43.070]  Is that real?
[01:33:45.993 --> 01:33:48.074]  I've seen that, and some of it's real.
[01:33:48.354 --> 01:33:49.775]  I'm not sure about the rest, but yeah.
[01:33:49.855 --> 01:33:53.218]  Weiner was a whole other operation with Chuckie Schumer.
[01:33:54.651 --> 01:34:02.402]  It's all one club.
[01:34:03.423 --> 01:34:04.284]  It's all one club.
[01:34:04.545 --> 01:34:10.693]  I mean, Alec Baldwin, he's been indicted for shooting a lady that was going to make a documentary on human trafficking.
[01:34:11.341 --> 01:34:16.026]  I mean look, I remember that state senator, I forget her name, from like South Carolina or whatever.
[01:34:16.427 --> 01:34:17.688]  I had her on like 10 years ago.
[01:34:17.988 --> 01:34:20.911]  She came on and said, next week I'm breaking with child trafficking in the state.
[01:34:20.931 --> 01:34:22.453]  They killed her and her husband the next day.
[01:34:22.473 --> 01:34:23.454]  I remember like two days later.
[01:34:24.035 --> 01:34:25.476]  So here's the good news.
[01:34:25.897 --> 01:34:28.159]  They used to kill people because they didn't want this to get out.
[01:34:28.299 --> 01:34:28.960]  It's out now.
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:30.942]  Oh, but we're losing.
[01:34:31.162 --> 01:34:32.644]  We need to give up, Angie.
[01:34:34.275 --> 01:34:34.695]  Yeah, no.
[01:34:35.035 --> 01:34:39.796]  We ain't gonna give up, we're gonna push harder, we're gonna buy Alpha Power, and we're gonna take them down.
[01:34:40.016 --> 01:34:41.017]  You know who that guy was?
[01:34:41.057 --> 01:34:46.938]  He probably was a Fed front guy, but what he really is is Tokyo Rose from World War II.
[01:34:47.478 --> 01:34:54.680]  Even as we were dropping atomic bombs on Japan, she was on the radio telling our ships on AM and shortwave radio that we'd lost.
[01:34:56.266 --> 01:35:02.650]  Well, the good news about guys like him, they can't reproduce because they don't like women and they can't reproduce.
[01:35:02.670 --> 01:35:04.611]  I do think that's obvious.
[01:35:04.691 --> 01:35:09.333]  I was going to say, the big thing I pick up from Patriot Front, which came out of the Charlottesville thing in 2017.
[01:35:11.206 --> 01:35:17.408]  And I remember having the guys on, and I went, we looked up the head of the group, the previous group, and I go, you worked for Obama three years ago.
[01:35:17.428 --> 01:35:17.848]  Yeah, I did.
[01:35:17.868 --> 01:35:18.689]  You were a Democrat one year.
[01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:19.649]  He goes, well, now I'm not.
[01:35:19.949 --> 01:35:22.230]  And it's literally gay fat dudes.
[01:35:22.970 --> 01:35:29.773]  I mean, it's exactly, it's like a bunch of gay dudes that dress up and pose as patriots to make us look bad.
[01:35:30.673 --> 01:35:31.253]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:35:31.453 --> 01:35:35.775]  It's just like the old shakers, you know, they're going to depopulate themselves.
[01:35:36.786 --> 01:35:41.809]  Well, what it is, is they're all in their uniforms, their outfits, and they got some mentally ill people.
[01:35:41.829 --> 01:35:44.831]  What it is, is that they're trying to find McVeigh Patsy's in the group.
[01:35:45.511 --> 01:35:47.072]  What it is, is a giant PSYOP.
[01:35:47.212 --> 01:35:48.994]  They're trying to find Patsy's in the group.
[01:35:49.674 --> 01:35:52.816]  And the whole thing, I take one look at it, is federal and CIA.
[01:35:53.176 --> 01:35:54.597]  In fact, I'm not saying the FBI runs it.
[01:35:54.637 --> 01:35:55.538]  I say it's CIA.
[01:35:56.058 --> 01:35:57.139]  Completely stinks of it.
[01:35:57.419 --> 01:35:58.519]  Thank you so much, Angie.
[01:35:58.539 --> 01:35:59.000]  Great point.
[01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:03.691]   Yeah, I was gonna say they look like Fed front.
[01:36:03.971 --> 01:36:05.212]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:36:05.232 --> 01:36:07.893]  It's just like, give up, go off the air.
[01:36:08.153 --> 01:36:08.593]  Yeah.
[01:36:09.454 --> 01:36:09.714]  Yeah.
[01:36:10.094 --> 01:36:12.595]  When we've been proven right, we're winning it on every front.
[01:36:13.235 --> 01:36:15.096]  And all I get is high fives at the grocery store.
[01:36:15.736 --> 01:36:15.936]  Yeah.
[01:36:16.116 --> 01:36:17.097]  Hey, Tokyo Rose.
[01:36:18.097 --> 01:36:19.017]  I'm the Enola Gay.
[01:36:19.297 --> 01:36:19.858]  Meet this.
[01:36:20.118 --> 01:36:20.978]  Meet Fat Boy.
[01:36:23.599 --> 01:36:24.720]  Fat Man and Little Boy.
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:26.180]  Meet, meet.
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:26.961]  Give up?
[01:36:27.021 --> 01:36:27.221]  Here.
[01:36:27.381 --> 01:36:28.221]  Here, Tokyo Rose.
[01:36:28.421 --> 01:36:29.922]  Here's a couple of atomic bombs.
[01:36:29.942 --> 01:36:30.342]  Bloop.
[01:36:30.602 --> 01:36:30.862]  Bloop.
[01:36:31.282 --> 01:36:32.883]  That's how I'm going to give up.
[01:36:34.778 --> 01:36:47.485]  I'm sorry for the Japanese too, I think we went too far with dropping bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but she was on the radio, it's on record, going, you're losing, you're losing Americans, roll over and die, it's all over for you, you're losing, you're losing, give up now!
[01:36:49.986 --> 01:36:51.147]  I'm sorry, it's ridiculous.
[01:36:51.547 --> 01:37:04.134]  It's like Baghdad bomb in 2003, and there's like F-16s dropping bombs all behind them, it's like, there are no Americans in Iraq, they've been driven into the ocean, we have destroyed them all.
[01:37:07.338 --> 01:37:08.579]  Jimmy was Tokyo Rose.
[01:37:08.999 --> 01:37:10.781]  Hey, Michael and Mash, you're on the air.
[01:37:10.801 --> 01:37:11.681]  Go ahead, thanks for holding.
[01:37:12.742 --> 01:37:13.423]  Hey, thank you.
[01:37:14.203 --> 01:37:15.084]  I got two questions.
[01:37:15.344 --> 01:37:23.871]  One, do you agree with Millet, what he said at the World Economic Forum?
[01:37:24.171 --> 01:37:28.655]  And two, I agree with the last caller, Patriot Front is probably a bunch of virgins.
[01:37:29.996 --> 01:37:31.617]  Well, I don't think there's any... Well, they're not virgins.
[01:37:31.657 --> 01:37:34.700]  They've all been having sex together, obviously, but that's my opinion.
[01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:39.643]  Well, I've taken one look at him when they did that staged arrest thing, but seriously.
[01:37:40.603 --> 01:37:42.405]  And my gaydar is not that good, but you know.
[01:37:43.245 --> 01:37:46.228]  But when it's super obvious, like Liberace, it was obvious.
[01:37:47.469 --> 01:37:50.351]  But I saw transcripts of his speech.
[01:37:50.812 --> 01:37:53.273]  What particular parts did you mean?
[01:37:53.974 --> 01:37:58.277]  He calls out collectivism, he says the elites... Yeah, no, no, no.
[01:37:58.398 --> 01:38:01.820]  So, the majority of what he said was on point.
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:03.081]  Like, almost all of it.
[01:38:03.422 --> 01:38:03.842]  It was good.
[01:38:04.754 --> 01:38:10.618]  And I guarantee that's going to get Zoomers panicking because they're not going to understand what he's talking about until it's over.
[01:38:10.698 --> 01:38:13.139]  Oh yeah, I mean, I only saw transcripts and a few clips.
[01:38:13.239 --> 01:38:14.700]  I'll be honest, I didn't watch the whole thing.
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:16.321]  He gave a bunch of other interviews too.
[01:38:16.841 --> 01:38:18.623]  But I noticed people went, why is he there?
[01:38:18.683 --> 01:38:19.503]  He's a traitor.
[01:38:19.903 --> 01:38:22.305]  He was laughing at Klaus Schwab when he introduced him.
[01:38:22.605 --> 01:38:25.006]  And they got right up there and said the elites are the problem.
[01:38:25.307 --> 01:38:30.610]  You consolidated power and you're full of crap and your carbon taxes are BS.
[01:38:30.630 --> 01:38:31.710]  I mean, I saw that much.
[01:38:31.730 --> 01:38:32.431]  I thought it was beautiful.
[01:38:33.297 --> 01:38:34.898]  I got a third secret question.
[01:38:34.979 --> 01:38:42.245]  Now, do you think that's going to be a common thing now where they're just going to start hitting them with these fucked up questions that they're not going to be able to answer?
[01:38:43.858 --> 01:38:46.819]  Yeah, I mean, it wasn't just Millie.
[01:38:47.219 --> 01:38:50.640]  It was like, people got up and got in their face.
[01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:51.800]  A whole bunch of people did.
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:56.781]  And again, even the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Politico said, we're losing.
[01:38:56.821 --> 01:38:57.502]  Everyone hates us.
[01:38:57.582 --> 01:38:58.722]  Oh, no, what do we do?
[01:38:59.082 --> 01:39:00.202]  They don't trust us anymore.
[01:39:00.262 --> 01:39:02.783]  They don't want to eat bugs.
[01:39:03.243 --> 01:39:05.844]  And then Alexander Soros got up and was like stuttering.
[01:39:06.744 --> 01:39:39.277]   We have to, uh, uh, uh, democracy, uh, uh, uh, Trump wants to hurt democracy, and that's why we have to, like, so what if people, uh, uh, uh, I mean, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, sorry if they're mad, uh, I mean, we, uh, are helping minorities, and uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, The only thing I discriminate against, I'm not mad at the last caller, is bad phones.
[01:39:40.158 --> 01:39:55.935]  By the way, I would have had that guy on attacking me for an hour, because it's very entertaining, it's very informative, but it's just, it's repetitive how they just have talking points and he's reading off a script, probably in his Patriot Front outfit on.
[01:39:58.837 --> 01:40:01.299]  Oh, those guys are so being set up, including their leader.
[01:40:02.079 --> 01:40:03.440]  I already can see the whole operation.
[01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:06.302]  I can see for miles and miles and miles.
[01:40:06.742 --> 01:40:08.944]  Since I mentioned it, we'll come back and take a few more of your calls.
[01:40:09.324 --> 01:40:10.745]  Yon's coming on, but I'm going to get to everybody.
[01:40:10.765 --> 01:40:12.786]  I love you, we're going to get to everybody.
[01:40:15.108 --> 01:40:16.288]  This is Alexander Soros.
[01:40:16.769 --> 01:40:17.829]  Listen to this guy.
[01:40:17.909 --> 01:40:20.851]  This is one of the top generals of the New World Order.
[01:40:21.112 --> 01:40:22.332]  This makes me sleep good at night.
[01:40:22.452 --> 01:40:22.973]  Listen to this.
[01:40:24.881 --> 01:40:36.403]  To actually create a narrative that inspires people to vote and to believe, you know, in democracy and democratic institutions.
[01:40:36.503 --> 01:40:44.485]  On the institutional part, I think that we can talk about institutions as these abstract things, but institutions are also about people.
[01:40:45.225 --> 01:40:56.174]   And, you know, we just heard this point about untrustworthy people, and we talked about things in the United States like, you know, Like checks and balances, which aren't written anywhere, but are customs.
[01:40:56.735 --> 01:41:02.800]  And one man, Donald Trump, literally came in and just took that, you know, took that, took that all away.
[01:41:03.861 --> 01:41:18.895]  You know, so, you know, so, you know, but when I see this, you know, when I look at this, you know, you know, more globally regarding, regarding, you know, regarding democracy, I also say to myself, when was this great time?
[01:41:19.615 --> 01:41:25.942]  That everybody got along so well and, you know, things were going so, so great.
[01:41:26.002 --> 01:41:36.313]  I mean, I think, you know, you know, the, you know, I think that we really have to be careful here in, you know, in this nostalgia.
[01:41:37.013 --> 01:41:56.069]  Uh, for a time, uh, you know, for a time past because a lot of the reactions we're seeing in society are actually reactions to positive, uh, to positive things like, you know, like equality, uh, for women, um, you know, uh, and, um, uh, you know, and greater diversity, uh, which come with backlash.
[01:41:56.309 --> 01:41:57.370]  So it's like, everybody hates us.
[01:41:57.410 --> 01:41:58.110]  What's wrong with that?
[01:41:59.011 --> 01:42:02.293]  That's our enemy, a gibbering moron with $37 million.
[01:42:02.333 --> 01:42:03.914]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:03.734 --> 01:42:04.734]  Stay with us.
[01:42:04.734 --> 01:42:06.734]  Hey, I got some good news for everybody.

[01:42:56.932 --> 01:42:57.973]  A lot of products that aren't available.
[01:42:59.295 --> 01:43:00.896]  Yeah, Emmett Sullivan Jr., Emmett's friend, and the FBI.
[01:43:00.936 --> 01:43:05.599]  You want to know who is responsible for the pipe bomb?
[01:43:05.418 --> 01:43:07.097]  Back to your phone calls.
[01:43:07.097 --> 01:43:09.998]  The great Michael Yon's got huge breaking news coming up.
[01:43:09.998 --> 01:43:12.637]  Sean calling from the Republic.
[01:43:12.637 --> 01:43:13.778]  You're on the air, Sean.
[01:43:13.778 --> 01:43:16.597]  Welcome on January 6th and the pipe bomb.
[01:43:16.597 --> 01:43:17.438]  Go ahead.
[01:43:17.438 --> 01:43:22.957]  Yeah, Emmett Sullivan Jr., Emmett's friend, and the FBI.
[01:43:22.957 --> 01:43:25.538]  You wanna know who is responsible for the pipe bomb?
[01:43:25.538 --> 01:43:26.378]  There you go.
[01:43:26.378 --> 01:43:32.778]   Okay, I'm not saying I was ignoring you, but I missed the name.
[01:43:32.706 --> 01:43:33.266]  You said who?
[01:43:34.027 --> 01:43:37.348]  Emmett Sullivan Jr., his friend, and the FBI.
[01:43:37.428 --> 01:43:38.349]  There you go, Darren Beatty.
[01:43:40.590 --> 01:43:42.451]  Who is Emmett Sullivan Jr.?
[01:43:43.531 --> 01:43:48.953]  I'm glad you actually asked that, Alex, because his dad is somebody who we should all be interested in looking up.
[01:43:49.414 --> 01:43:51.795]  He's a high-profile, high-ranking D.C.
[01:43:51.815 --> 01:43:52.975]  swamp creature judge.
[01:43:53.656 --> 01:43:56.137]  Pretty sure that dude's been in his position for probably 10, 20 years.
[01:43:57.836 --> 01:44:04.160]  Depraved individual, corrupt as hell, and I'm pretty sure he oversaw the persecution of Mike Flynn.
[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:09.804]  So if you look up Emmett Sullivan Sr., Judge Emmett Sullivan, that's his son.
[01:44:11.044 --> 01:44:17.949]  Well, we don't screen calls here for content, and I'm being honest with you, I've heard that name before.
[01:44:18.169 --> 01:44:19.610]  Who is Emmett Sullivan Jr.
[01:44:19.630 --> 01:44:19.870]  known as?
[01:44:21.741 --> 01:44:24.644]  I don't know, but I'm pretty sure his brothers are Jaden X and the other one.
[01:44:24.724 --> 01:44:28.267]  It wasn't Jaden X, the one that was in the J6, in the building.
[01:44:28.307 --> 01:44:39.516]  Yeah, that's who I remember that name associated with, is Jaden X. Who bragged on video, as he goes in with a girl connected to the Central Intelligence Agency, he goes, I told you this was going to happen, see?
[01:44:39.536 --> 01:44:42.319]  And, and, and, yeah.
[01:44:42.719 --> 01:44:43.420]  Well, I don't...
[01:44:44.913 --> 01:44:48.534]  So, sir, let me ask this, and I'm not saying you're credible, because, I mean, I don't know.
[01:44:48.574 --> 01:44:49.475]  You're just a caller called in.
[01:44:49.855 --> 01:44:51.195]  I'm just asking questions here.
[01:44:51.215 --> 01:44:54.657]  I mean, would you like us to put you on hold?
[01:44:54.677 --> 01:44:56.037]  Would you like to talk to someone?
[01:44:56.057 --> 01:45:01.179]  No, you actually, actually, Alex, you put me on hold to talk to your crew about this over a year ago.
[01:45:01.199 --> 01:45:02.040]  You asked me to get that.
[01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:03.620]  I remember you, I vaguely remember that.
[01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:07.442]  Well, we get a little, we're not that big, but we'll just, here, let me ask this question.
[01:45:07.462 --> 01:45:08.422]  You're on air right now.
[01:45:08.462 --> 01:45:10.263]  If you're saying this is true, how do you know this?
[01:45:11.709 --> 01:45:15.092]  Well, anybody who knows John McGreevy knows he spoke the truth.
[01:45:15.273 --> 01:45:16.574]  You can kill John McGreevy.
[01:45:16.854 --> 01:45:20.497]  You can try to do a wrap-up smear on John McGreevy at the end of his life.
[01:45:20.898 --> 01:45:23.840]  It was a bogus wrap-up smear, but you can't kill the message.
[01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:25.982]  John McGreevy told the truth, Alex.
[01:45:26.322 --> 01:45:27.824]  John McGreevy is a whistleblower.
[01:45:28.324 --> 01:45:30.286]  He's a God-fearing patriot whistleblower.
[01:45:30.326 --> 01:45:30.966]  He told the truth.
[01:45:31.066 --> 01:45:37.252]  Anybody out there listening right now that wants to hear more about this or know who John McGreevy is, look him up.
[01:45:39.136 --> 01:45:41.378]  And his handle was JohnHereToHelp.
[01:45:41.798 --> 01:45:42.479]  He told the truth.
[01:45:43.239 --> 01:45:44.260]  I don't remember this stuff.
[01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:45.101]  I remember you vaguely.
[01:45:45.661 --> 01:45:46.662]  Who was John McGreevy?
[01:45:47.602 --> 01:45:53.907]  John Mc... Oh, well, actually, you should know, Alex, because you actually hosted an interview that Stu Peters did with John McGreevy.
[01:45:54.628 --> 01:45:55.809]  I think they just put it on screen.
[01:45:55.849 --> 01:45:56.989]  So you're saying that guy's dead?
[01:45:58.410 --> 01:46:00.952]  I'm pretty sure they killed him because they were trying to kill him for a long time.
[01:46:00.992 --> 01:46:03.454]  But my point is, you can kill the messenger.
[01:46:03.614 --> 01:46:05.556]  You cannot kill the message.
[01:46:06.525 --> 01:46:12.889]  John McGreevy deserves to be remembered as a patriot, as a whistleblower, and as a national treasure.
[01:46:13.009 --> 01:46:15.231]  Okay, but first you said he's dead and now you're not sure.
[01:46:15.291 --> 01:46:15.911]  I'm being honest with you.
[01:46:16.152 --> 01:46:17.432]  I remember your call vaguely.
[01:46:17.673 --> 01:46:29.341]  This is all Greek to me and I'm just trying to figure out... They killed John McGreevy and they did a wrap-up smear on him at the end of his life using the Harford County Sheriff's Department.
[01:46:29.661 --> 01:46:35.705]  They threatened John's wife if he didn't sign a pre-written quote-unquote admission of guilt.
[01:46:36.365 --> 01:46:40.927]  So, they persecuted him, they killed him, they did a rap... Alright, alright, here's the deal.
[01:46:41.167 --> 01:46:42.188]  We're a big talk show.
[01:46:42.648 --> 01:46:45.550]  People are driving around, they don't know what you're... I'm sure people will investigate this.
[01:46:45.610 --> 01:46:46.750]  I don't know what you're saying is true.
[01:46:47.350 --> 01:46:49.131]  I will try to look into it some.
[01:46:50.252 --> 01:46:51.493]  I know this though, in closing.
[01:46:52.033 --> 01:46:54.454]  They're definitely trying to cover up something with the pipe bomb.
[01:46:54.774 --> 01:46:56.755]  What do you think they were actually planning that day?
[01:46:57.135 --> 01:46:58.276]  Why did they not go with it?
[01:47:01.229 --> 01:47:02.510]  I don't know all the details, Alex.
[01:47:02.530 --> 01:47:04.151]  I only know John McGreevey told the truth.
[01:47:04.191 --> 01:47:04.791]  That's all I got.
[01:47:05.011 --> 01:47:06.632]  Alright, well, I'm sorry.
[01:47:06.712 --> 01:47:10.735]  I don't... I mean, you're like... You had a guest host on that said this.
[01:47:11.115 --> 01:47:13.496]  Dude, I don't... I like her other shows.
[01:47:13.556 --> 01:47:14.337]  I like Owen's show.
[01:47:14.397 --> 01:47:15.537]  I like Harrison's show.
[01:47:16.038 --> 01:47:17.479]  I'm usually busy working.
[01:47:17.759 --> 01:47:19.380]  I don't... I'm not omnipresent.
[01:47:20.154 --> 01:47:21.935]  Some people call and they say, why don't you cover this?
[01:47:21.955 --> 01:47:23.777]  A lot of times it's like, what's going on?
[01:47:24.778 --> 01:47:25.778]  Or the phones will start ringing.
[01:47:25.798 --> 01:47:28.841]  Why is it Jones covering this cool shooting happening now that started an hour ago?
[01:47:29.321 --> 01:47:30.662]  I'm not, I'm not God, folks.
[01:47:30.702 --> 01:47:31.223]  Far from it.
[01:47:31.363 --> 01:47:35.066]  So, um, that's why I take your calls.
[01:47:35.266 --> 01:47:38.608]  These are unfiltered and, and it's like all sorts of stuff comes out.
[01:47:38.628 --> 01:47:44.453]  It's always interesting, uh, today particularly, but I'm, you know, it's up to people to look into this for themselves.
[01:47:44.473 --> 01:47:47.446]   Cause I don't, I remember the name you said.
[01:47:47.486 --> 01:47:48.849]  I knew that was tied to Jade Nex.
[01:47:49.731 --> 01:47:50.813]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:47:51.034 --> 01:47:52.096]  Stay with us.
[01:47:52.136 --> 01:47:55.062]  We've got huge guests coming up and I'll get to all your calls as well.
[01:47:55.684 --> 01:47:56.024]  Alright!
[01:47:57.546 --> 01:48:16.415]  I get so frustrated, and I'm not mad at people, I just get so frustrated when I see all these new headlines saying NGOs discovered from the UN and from other organizations, the Democratic Party and the State Department, building refugee centers and shipping illegals in.
[01:48:16.895 --> 01:48:18.356]  That's just running the whole show.
[01:48:18.376 --> 01:48:19.716]  That's where Mayorkas comes from.
[01:48:20.197 --> 01:48:26.078]   And the same big UN NGO in the last 15 years that invaded Europe with Islamists and
[01:48:26.078 --> 01:48:29.717]   others, it's the one hired to run major operations in Texas.
[01:48:29.717 --> 01:48:37.448]   And then I see it breaking, oh my god, there's a Darien Gap, and they're building bridges and highways in, and the
[01:48:37.448 --> 01:48:41.227]   Chinese have built, in consultation with the Yorkers, they went and visited
[01:48:41.227 --> 01:48:44.597]  this giant refugee resettlement operation.
[01:48:44.715 --> 01:48:53.878]  Yes, our government's paying for highways, and roads, and credit cards, and bus tickets, and plane tickets, and Congress can kill the damn funding!
[01:48:55.218 --> 01:49:05.821]   Instead they have these constant discussions, and these constant Debates with mayors about whether the border is broken or not.
[01:49:05.901 --> 01:49:08.444]  We know the names of the NGOs.
[01:49:08.784 --> 01:49:09.625]  We have the videos.
[01:49:09.945 --> 01:49:10.826]  We have the photos.
[01:49:11.226 --> 01:49:14.209]  We have them bragging about all of it.
[01:49:16.011 --> 01:49:27.222]  And joining us is the great Michael Yan, former Army Special Operations operative and one of the best known, if not the best known, military correspondents in combat.
[01:49:28.131 --> 01:49:31.533]  Probably been more common than any other military correspondent in modern history.
[01:49:32.373 --> 01:50:06.107]   And he is at x at Michael underscore yon, y-o-n, michaelyon.com, michaelyon.locals.com, and he's been down there at the border of South America into Panama, where there is a full CHICOM-UN takeover, and all the videos of the roads, the bridges, the refugee centers, all of it going on, and I just sit there Because he's been down there for years, and now they built giant camps and roads and bridges and boats pulling up, just thousands of Chinese pouring across, and it's like, where's Congress?
[01:50:06.127 --> 01:50:07.890]  They're always a million years behind.
[01:50:09.244 --> 01:50:10.865]  Absolutely ridiculous.
[01:50:10.985 --> 01:50:13.365]  So, Michael Young joins us.
[01:50:13.845 --> 01:50:14.846]  We've got a lot of videos.
[01:50:14.886 --> 01:50:16.966]  We've got a boil-down video he sent us as well.
[01:50:17.407 --> 01:50:19.267]  So, Michael, whenever you're ready, they've got the videos.
[01:50:19.287 --> 01:50:20.407]  You can call for what you want.
[01:50:20.728 --> 01:50:22.128]  We can get into who Majorca is.
[01:50:22.148 --> 01:50:25.309]  He's not just some buffoon, some incompetent.
[01:50:25.349 --> 01:50:26.629]  This is part of an operation.
[01:50:26.649 --> 01:50:27.830]  So, I'm going to try to give you the floor.
[01:50:28.250 --> 01:50:29.950]  So, don't stop or I'll jump in.
[01:50:30.410 --> 01:50:32.731]  You can tell the crew when you want to play your four-minute compilation.
[01:50:33.791 --> 01:50:35.192]  You can start wherever you want to begin here.
[01:50:36.924 --> 01:50:37.525]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:50:38.085 --> 01:50:39.647]  I really appreciate you having me on.
[01:50:39.727 --> 01:50:41.068]  I just got out of the jungle.
[01:50:42.169 --> 01:50:45.131]  Let me set the table about what's going on right now and where I'm at.
[01:50:45.452 --> 01:50:47.053]  I am at Panama City now.
[01:50:47.173 --> 01:50:48.715]  I'm back out of the Darien Gap.
[01:50:49.155 --> 01:50:51.017]  That's the Panama Canal behind me.
[01:50:51.457 --> 01:51:00.385]  I just took down into the jungle Japanese journalist Masato Kanaha, Ann Vander Steele, Brett Weinstein, and Chris Martinson.
[01:51:00.805 --> 01:51:02.605]  Chris Martinson's been on your show before.
[01:51:03.006 --> 01:51:09.387]  And so I just took those four and some others down to the Darien Gap, and we went deep into the jungle, and we saw many things.
[01:51:09.447 --> 01:51:14.948]  And by the way, two days ago, weirdly, this is the bridge that they're building down by Yevita, by the way.
[01:51:15.469 --> 01:51:21.330]  So this new bridge that they're building... And by the way, a lot of this is exclusive, never-before-seen, breaking now.
[01:51:22.808 --> 01:51:23.328]  Absolutely.
[01:51:24.268 --> 01:51:30.070]  This map right there came out of a book, you know, with that red cover that you just saw.
[01:51:30.090 --> 01:51:31.991]  This is drone footage we just made.
[01:51:32.351 --> 01:51:35.532]  That's the new road being built into the Darien Gap.
[01:51:35.912 --> 01:51:39.353]  And this bridge that's going over the Rio Chucanaca is near Yavitza.
[01:51:39.873 --> 01:51:48.396]  Right, Evita is the little town of about 2,000 people at the end of the road of Highway 1, the Pan American Highway.
[01:51:48.736 --> 01:51:59.100]  And so that red book there, the China's Belt and Road Initiative book, was first published in Spanish, and then they translated it to English.
[01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:02.061]  I got the English version, and I got that map out of it.
[01:52:02.881 --> 01:52:08.206]  Basically, China's talking about how they want to open up the gap and that sort of thing, the Darien Gap, and now they're doing it.
[01:52:08.506 --> 01:52:13.210]  Now, one of the ways they do it is the Chinese build little bridges all over the place in the Darien Gap.
[01:52:13.530 --> 01:52:18.694]  I'm out on those bridges all the time, and the bridges get blown out every rainy season.
[01:52:18.814 --> 01:52:21.576]  The floods here are quite extreme, and it blows the bridges out.
[01:52:21.916 --> 01:52:28.722]  But there's billions, and I mean billions with a B, dollars worth of trees out in that jungle, the Darien Gap jungle.
[01:52:29.102 --> 01:52:37.910]   So the Chinese will build those bridges for the The Indians do sell the trees at about $20 each, except for the cocoa trees, which are about $2,000 per ton, but those trees are like drugs.
[01:52:37.730 --> 01:52:42.409]   Indians do sell the trees at about $20 each, except for the cocoa bolo trees, which are
[01:52:42.409 --> 01:52:44.770]  about $2,000 per ton.
[01:52:44.770 --> 01:52:47.249]  But those trees are like drugs.
[01:52:47.249 --> 01:52:51.409]   In other words, they're worth a lot more downrange than they are in the jungle.
[01:52:51.409 --> 01:52:56.310]   If you make chess pieces out of those trees or furniture or those sorts of things, those
[01:52:56.310 --> 01:52:58.130]  trees are worth billions of dollars.
[01:52:58.130 --> 01:53:01.249]  And that's why they're just destroying the Darien Gap.
[01:53:01.249 --> 01:53:06.249]   They're also opening it up to South America, which would be a huge invasion route.
[01:53:06.259 --> 01:53:08.860]  The dairy gap is essentially open at this point already.
[01:53:09.060 --> 01:53:13.921]  There's no paved road all the way through, but we have thousands of people come through a day at this point.
[01:53:14.261 --> 01:53:17.302]  Last August there was 82,000 in one month.
[01:53:17.342 --> 01:53:19.142]  That was the highest number that I know of.
[01:53:19.462 --> 01:53:20.863]  That number is increasing.
[01:53:21.183 --> 01:53:23.663]  However, a lot of people are going around the gap now.
[01:53:23.743 --> 01:53:31.085]  For instance, they're flying straight to Nicaragua, flying straight from Colombia to the United States.
[01:53:31.845 --> 01:53:34.626]  A lot of people, in other words, they're bypassing the gap.
[01:53:35.046 --> 01:53:42.909]  Other people, we were told on this last trip, are actually taking boats from Mexico up to Canada to come into the United States for Canada.
[01:53:43.209 --> 01:53:46.310]  And now they're trying to build hardened concrete bridges that don't wash out.
[01:53:46.330 --> 01:53:51.232]  I don't want to explain the camps, the full invasion, but people that don't know how strategic Panama Canal is.
[01:53:51.272 --> 01:53:54.234]  The French tried to build it, got 10% done, it failed.
[01:53:54.274 --> 01:53:55.614]  They lost tens of thousands of men.
[01:53:56.054 --> 01:53:56.554]  The U.S.
[01:53:56.594 --> 01:53:57.515]  was able to do it.
[01:53:58.095 --> 01:54:16.748]  And so this is so strategic for us, and been a military base, we're just letting the shy comms, everybody, come in, buy off the government, build bridges, set up UN camps, bring in all these people, Mayorkas goes and tours the camps, you caught him there, and then they fund through State Department money this invasion, and then Congress, in these hearings, never brings it up!
[01:54:17.028 --> 01:54:17.769]  It's incredible!
[01:54:19.096 --> 01:54:21.918]  Yeah, actually, you might hear the train going by right now.
[01:54:22.859 --> 01:54:28.143]  This is the canal behind me and there's a train, the famous Panama Canal train is between me and that canal.
[01:54:28.603 --> 01:54:33.747]  And they're using that train a lot now because the Lake Gatun is so low, they can hear the train.
[01:54:34.547 --> 01:54:38.951]  And so they're filling up that train with a lot of the cargo that's normally on the ships, right?
[01:54:39.431 --> 01:54:43.674]  And so, we just went through the dairy, we just went through the Panama Canal.
[01:54:43.894 --> 01:54:46.156]  Actually, that's right behind me, that's Miraflores Locks.
[01:54:46.472 --> 01:54:49.273]  when we just went through the canal a few days ago.
[01:54:49.273 --> 01:54:51.472]  Now, I'm sorry if that trains too loud.
[01:54:51.472 --> 01:54:52.472]  That's literally the...
[01:54:52.472 --> 01:54:53.472]  No, it's not.
[01:54:53.472 --> 01:54:58.472]   Now, when it comes to Mayarchus, Mayarchus has gone down to the Darien at least twice
[01:54:58.472 --> 01:54:59.472]  that I know of.
[01:54:59.472 --> 01:55:04.792]  I was there when he went down on April 18th of 2022.
[01:55:04.878 --> 01:55:06.038]  I've waited for four days.
[01:55:06.398 --> 01:55:08.619]  We came down in four Black Hawk helicopters.
[01:55:09.439 --> 01:55:16.542]  The South Com Commander was there, actually, Laura Richardson, the Commanding General, and our Ambassador Aponte was there as well.
[01:55:16.922 --> 01:55:20.824]  And so they went inside that camp that you showed earlier, which I call China Camp.
[01:55:21.124 --> 01:55:22.644]  Here they call it San Vicente Camp.
[01:55:22.844 --> 01:55:30.848]   Now one important thing about Mayorkas, a couple important things about Mayorkas, Mayorkas himself is an immigrant from Cuba.
[01:55:30.908 --> 01:55:31.849]  He was born in Cuba.
[01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:33.430]  So he's an actual immigrant.
[01:55:33.890 --> 01:55:36.592]  And he also was a board member on HIAS.
[01:55:36.952 --> 01:55:37.792]  That's important.
[01:55:38.453 --> 01:55:46.437]  He was a board member on HIAS before he joined the Department of Homeland Security as the Secretary of the Homeland Security.
[01:55:46.738 --> 01:55:55.423]   HIAS is the Hebrew immigration, basically it's a Jewish immigration sort of like Like IOM, right?
[01:55:55.463 --> 01:56:05.667]  In other words, they've been helping people get from here to there for who knows how long, according to their history that they've published, more than 100 years, but I'm actually unsure what's correct.
[01:56:05.907 --> 01:56:21.194]   But bottom line is, the highest office in Darien, actually there's a, they have one of their offices is about four minutes walk from me right now, but they have another office down in Darien, it's in a little house, it's right beside The China Camp that you just showed earlier.
[01:56:21.234 --> 01:56:25.497]  That's footage that I made of China Camp and that footage of HIAS.
[01:56:25.998 --> 01:56:35.704]  I was just with Brett Weinstein and Chris Martinson right in front of the HIAS office, right beside the China Camp, that Mayorkas flew down in his Blackhawks to build up.
[01:56:36.064 --> 01:56:44.550]  Now, when Mayorkas came in April of 2022, he promised to help build up these camps and the dairy.
[01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:45.831]  He has now done that.
[01:56:46.171 --> 01:56:48.933]  We have the before and after footage inside the camps.
[01:56:49.433 --> 01:56:52.817]  And from drone footage and from airplanes that I charter sometimes.
[01:56:53.477 --> 01:57:14.517]   Interestingly, the trailers inside ChinaCamp, which here they call San Vicente Camp, I call it ChinaCamp, it's more like a bus station really, but the ChinaCamp is, the trailers in ChinaCamp that you saw in the video that I sent you is actually, those trailers are actually made In China.
[01:57:14.837 --> 01:57:20.400]  So actually, the materials, much of the materials inside of the camp that we paid for with U.S.
[01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:23.781]  taxpayer money, we actually bought it in China.
[01:57:24.121 --> 01:57:30.083]  I mean, that's him, that's Mayorkas landing on April 18, 2022, just beside China Camp.
[01:57:30.443 --> 01:57:43.648]   So he landed in the Blackhawks, and stayed for a few hours, and then he took off, and I watched him land, and I watched him take off, and I have footage of them, and they also, Made footage themselves when they were inside the camp, which they published.
[01:57:43.988 --> 01:57:52.870]  So if you look up, you know, Mayorkas' name and Darien, you can see some of the public, some of the photos that their public affairs published, the Department of Homeland Security.
[01:57:53.210 --> 01:57:58.992]  And interestingly, you'll see a mock-up of the camp, the San Vicente Camp, again, which I call China Camp.
[01:57:59.659 --> 01:58:02.382]  There's a mock-up of what they wanted it to become.
[01:58:02.502 --> 01:58:04.804]  It has now become that, and it is actually larger.
[01:58:05.244 --> 01:58:14.213]  Now, this whole infrastructure from Ecuador to Colombia, Panama, and all the way up, it's getting bigger and bigger.
[01:58:14.573 --> 01:58:16.155]  It's getting faster and faster.
[01:58:16.215 --> 01:58:17.897]  Like, I was just up in Guatemala.
[01:58:19.357 --> 01:58:23.198]  Okay, I just circled that for you just before we went online.
[01:58:23.538 --> 01:58:25.439]  That's the highest building to the left.
[01:58:26.319 --> 01:58:29.799]  In fact, I tried to rent that building, but HIAS got it before me.
[01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:33.040]  And that's the camp right there on the right, which I call China Camp.
[01:58:33.080 --> 01:58:34.140]  That's in the Darien Gap.
[01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:37.141]  That road on the far left is the Pan American Highway.
[01:58:37.481 --> 01:58:40.102]  This is more like, okay, that's the way it was on April 18, 2022.
[01:58:42.282 --> 01:58:47.464]  Now, if you go to the next photo, it's a lot of trailers and it's a lot larger.
[01:58:47.484 --> 01:58:48.484]  Okay, not that.
[01:58:48.565 --> 01:58:49.665]  That's still April 18th.
[01:58:49.725 --> 01:58:51.366]  That's his security right there on the right.
[01:58:51.746 --> 01:58:52.306]  You see the eye?
[01:58:52.386 --> 01:58:53.927]  Okay, that's the way it is now.
[01:58:54.007 --> 01:58:55.387]  That was January.
[01:58:55.707 --> 01:58:56.688]  That was just like, what?
[01:58:56.788 --> 01:58:57.948]  That was 18th of January.
[01:58:57.988 --> 01:59:01.630]  That's like, you know, six days ago or so, or five days ago, right?
[01:59:01.930 --> 01:59:03.530]  So that's the way it is right now.
[01:59:03.990 --> 01:59:06.591]  You can see it's grown immeasurably, much larger.
[01:59:06.652 --> 01:59:07.872]  Not immeasurably, it's measurable.
[01:59:08.172 --> 01:59:14.054]  But it's grown a great deal, and it's more like a bus stop now, because most of the people don't stay there very long.
[01:59:14.394 --> 01:59:20.596]  They come out of the Darien Gap, and then they get on buses, you see the buses there, and they go straight up to Costa Rica.
[01:59:20.636 --> 01:59:47.960]   Now, even as early as a few months ago, when you got to the Costa Rican-Panama border, you would have another delay, but now the Panamanian and Costa Rican presidents met down in Darien, On October 6th, the day before the attack in Israel, they met down, that's HIAS, that's a photo I just recently made in the Darien and Gap, the two presidents of Costa Rica and Panama announced that they were going to smooth the flow
[01:59:48.901 --> 01:59:58.589]  It's a program called Controlled Flow that was actually made by the United States, or let's say brokered, and so that the flow between Costa Rica and Panama is much faster.
[01:59:58.949 --> 02:00:06.535]  So I want to say again... So Mayorkas acts like he's against all this, but the State Department's funding it, and that's on record.
[02:00:06.575 --> 02:00:09.678]  So why is it Congress, when I see the hearings, bringing this up?
[02:00:09.958 --> 02:00:13.921]  They talk about what hits our border, but they never talk about how our government's funding it.
[02:00:14.501 --> 02:00:17.624]  Shouldn't we be able to make a political uproar and shut the funding down?
[02:00:18.996 --> 02:00:25.620]  Well, you know, all the congressmen that I speak with, which is a lot, they almost, Tom Tiffany does.
[02:00:25.681 --> 02:00:28.983]  Congressman Tiffany, if you have him on, he can give you a proper briefing.
[02:00:29.283 --> 02:00:30.023]  He's from West Compton.
[02:00:30.264 --> 02:00:31.625]  I took him into the Darien Gap.
[02:00:31.945 --> 02:00:35.407]  Congressman Tiffany went down several, two or three years ago with me, right?
[02:00:35.907 --> 02:00:37.849]  And so he'll give you a proper briefing.
[02:00:38.109 --> 02:00:44.653]  But most of the others, the only ones that know anything about it are the ones that have talked with people like me or Todd Benson, right?
[02:00:45.694 --> 02:00:47.115]  Most of the others are just clueless.
[02:00:47.395 --> 02:01:00.857]  Yeah, I mean it's so frustrating because you've been out there for years, been on the show for over a year, saying they're building the camp, now it's built, they're building the roads, they're building the roads, they're building the bridges, and then he sits there and acts dumb about where these giant caravans are coming from.
[02:01:01.458 --> 02:01:05.778]  So it's got to be the Republicans know this is happening and are just pretending like they're ignorant.
[02:01:06.959 --> 02:01:12.560]  Oh yeah, and you see Mayorkas there, he's at Mayor Flores Locks, which is right behind me out here actually.
[02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:14.620]  And it looks like he's with the Secretary of State right there.
[02:01:15.489 --> 02:01:20.591]  Yeah, Blinken came down too, and you can see what some of the things that Blinken said about opening it up here.
[02:01:20.651 --> 02:01:22.351]  He's in deep collusion.
[02:01:22.711 --> 02:01:26.413]  Now, I just took, again, I just took Brett Weinstein and Dr. Chris Martenson down.
[02:01:26.693 --> 02:01:28.673]  They just got on the airplane yesterday and went back.
[02:01:28.733 --> 02:01:32.975]  We were with them for about a week, and we took them out to a lot of the camps, and we saw them a lot.
[02:01:33.295 --> 02:01:35.796]  You could see their eyes just exploded.
[02:01:35.976 --> 02:01:40.917]  They could hardly believe what they saw, not just in Darien, but where I'm at right now.
[02:01:40.937 --> 02:01:47.801]   He's in the wake up for one of the most famous Intellectual liberals, Brent Weinstein, he now says they released the virus as a weapon to take over.
[02:01:48.081 --> 02:01:49.923]  They're establishing a UN treaty world government.
[02:01:50.163 --> 02:01:51.784]  They're using illegal aliens as weapons.
[02:01:52.204 --> 02:01:54.506]  All these former big liberals like Jimmy Dore now get it.
[02:01:54.826 --> 02:01:57.547]  So what's exciting is we're actually taking liberals down.
[02:01:57.868 --> 02:01:59.609]  You're taking liberals down and they're waking up.
[02:02:00.925 --> 02:02:03.328]  Oh, you should have seen Brett totally woke up.
[02:02:03.348 --> 02:02:05.330]  He said, well, there's Misako Ganaha.
[02:02:05.470 --> 02:02:07.533]  Actually, she's still here in Panama.
[02:02:07.553 --> 02:02:08.414]  She's unbelievable.
[02:02:09.555 --> 02:02:13.559]  And Misako has been out in Darien, I don't know, probably a dozen times.
[02:02:13.619 --> 02:02:15.241]  I don't even know.
[02:02:15.321 --> 02:02:15.602]  Anyway.
[02:02:15.942 --> 02:02:17.203]  So this was the Panama Canal.
[02:02:17.243 --> 02:02:18.824]  We just went through it a few days ago.
[02:02:19.345 --> 02:02:24.348]  And we actually rented a private boat so that we could not have anybody bothering everybody.
[02:02:24.368 --> 02:02:26.170]  And we got a proper tour.
[02:02:26.570 --> 02:02:30.693]  And then we went back on the canal two days ago before they left.
[02:02:31.053 --> 02:02:33.194]  And actually, weirdly, I'll tell you a strange story.
[02:02:33.834 --> 02:02:52.219]  There's Brett and Chris Martinson out on, this is in the canal actually, and we'd stop, we were on a small boat, and as we came back from when we just did this, there were, a monkey was swimming, keep in mind, Brett Weinstein used to work in the canal in a place called Barro Colorado Island.
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:54.160]  He's an evolutionary biologist, right?
[02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:57.981]  So he did a lot of the study down here in Panama, and there's the monkey.
[02:02:58.041 --> 02:03:02.887]   The monkey was swimming across the canal, None of the people here had ever seen that before.
[02:03:03.649 --> 02:03:04.731]  Brett had never seen it.
[02:03:05.392 --> 02:03:07.076]  I've been talking with a lot of people.
[02:03:07.177 --> 02:03:09.742]  And a big container ship almost killed it.
[02:03:10.643 --> 02:03:18.709]  Yeah, the container ship sort of hit it, but the water, you know, moved it out of the way and the monkey kept trying to grab the container ship.
[02:03:19.129 --> 02:03:22.752]  And then, you know, we're trying to, I wanted to grab the monkey, but I didn't want to die.
[02:03:22.772 --> 02:03:24.753]  You know, those monkeys will eat you up.
[02:03:25.694 --> 02:03:32.859]  But anyway, somebody came along with a net, and actually I know the people that did it, as it turns out, they came along with a fishing net.
[02:03:32.879 --> 02:03:34.360]  They were actually on a fishing tour.
[02:03:34.680 --> 02:03:37.322]  They came along and netted this monkey and put him in a tree.
[02:03:38.283 --> 02:03:43.624]   You know, my friend, Matt Bracken, that you know, Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL, he saw this and he said,
[02:03:44.229 --> 02:03:45.710]  That monkey ought to be a seal.
[02:03:45.951 --> 02:03:49.614]  You can see the monkey was getting a little tired right when he shows up with the net.
[02:03:50.054 --> 02:03:54.118]  And it made all of us so happy that monkey didn't die.
[02:03:54.458 --> 02:03:57.060]  But I mean, it was amazing stuff.
[02:03:57.080 --> 02:04:04.867]  But first, give us a 35,000 foot view here, because this is, listeners, just like they planned new lockdowns last year, we exposed it.
[02:04:05.367 --> 02:04:10.652]  They still tried it, but it was defeated because people knew we have giant roads.
[02:04:11.749 --> 02:04:26.821]  We have invasion points, bridges being built, we have signs up, the UN funding it, State Department funding it, our government funding it, creating this, and you were telling me you think it'll be up to millions every few months soon just through this area.
[02:04:27.902 --> 02:04:30.123]  Again, that's what shuts it off.
[02:04:30.183 --> 02:04:32.205]  Not trying to build fences on our border.
[02:04:32.625 --> 02:04:33.846]  We control Panama.
[02:04:33.886 --> 02:04:35.107]  We have to shut it down there.
[02:04:35.507 --> 02:04:39.791]  So easy to do, but not once they get these official concrete bridges in.
[02:04:41.283 --> 02:04:44.065]  The problem is our government is doing it.
[02:04:44.205 --> 02:04:46.087]  That's what a lot of people don't quite understand.
[02:04:46.107 --> 02:04:48.549]  They keep saying, yeah, but who's actually doing it?
[02:04:48.589 --> 02:04:50.871]  And I'll say, let me repeat what I just said.
[02:04:51.271 --> 02:04:52.572]  Our government is doing it.
[02:04:52.632 --> 02:04:53.813]  They're like, yeah, but who's behind it?
[02:04:53.893 --> 02:05:00.118]  I'm like, well, our government, you know, like, you know, the president and the so-called president, Mayorkas, Blinken.
[02:05:00.658 --> 02:05:01.518]  But who's behind it?
[02:05:01.798 --> 02:05:02.959]  Our government is behind it.
[02:05:03.339 --> 02:05:09.020]  And the World Economic Forum, and the Chinese Communist Party, which clearly have captured key parts of our government.
[02:05:09.380 --> 02:05:11.461]  Like, for instance, Greg Abbott, state government.
[02:05:11.801 --> 02:05:13.842]  He's clearly one of the people doing this.
[02:05:14.162 --> 02:05:19.603]  Now, he does these kayfabe fights all the time, like, as if he's fighting Biden, but the border stays open.
[02:05:19.883 --> 02:05:26.105]  And you see a lot of people, you know, hey, look, there goes Abbott sending busloads of people to New York.
[02:05:26.305 --> 02:05:26.965]  That'll teach him.
[02:05:27.226 --> 02:05:29.687]  He's just injecting the poison deeper into our heart.
[02:05:30.007 --> 02:05:31.968]  He's clearing the decks for more to come in.
[02:05:32.929 --> 02:05:34.269]  Abbott could close the border.
[02:05:34.550 --> 02:05:36.110]  He's just a member of WEF.
[02:05:36.230 --> 02:05:37.551]  That's all you need to know.
[02:05:37.931 --> 02:05:44.075]  Bottom line is, the border will stay open as long as Abbott is the governor of Texas.
[02:05:44.335 --> 02:05:46.896]  It'll stay open as long as you have all these blue governors.
[02:05:46.916 --> 02:05:53.140]  Well, listen, I really respect you, because I wanted to think a few weeks ago, maybe he's going down to Eagle Pass, doing some control.
[02:05:55.288 --> 02:05:58.230]  But you're saying it's all cosmetic?
[02:05:58.290 --> 02:05:58.930]  It's kayfabe.
[02:05:59.051 --> 02:06:01.032]  You know, it's a professional wrestling match.
[02:06:01.492 --> 02:06:06.756]  I mean, and you can, every time they do this, when he put up the rubber barriers in the Rio Grande, I was there.
[02:06:06.796 --> 02:06:08.397]  When he put up the containers, I was there.
[02:06:08.417 --> 02:06:10.239]  When he puts up the concertina, I was there.
[02:06:10.579 --> 02:06:15.282]  It's like, we've gotten to the point where it's like, look, all you need to know is what uniform does Abbott wear.
[02:06:15.482 --> 02:06:16.223]  That's all you need to know.
[02:06:16.543 --> 02:06:17.624]  He wears the WEF uniform.
[02:06:17.904 --> 02:06:18.264]  Period.
[02:06:18.565 --> 02:06:29.693]  WEF is, as you well know, you know this better than probably anybody on this planet, World Economic Forum and the Chinese Communist Party, they're as aligned as Germany and Italy were in World War II.
[02:06:30.173 --> 02:06:36.178]  So if you are a member of the World Economic Forum, you're aligned with China on many of these things.
[02:06:36.218 --> 02:06:38.800]  You keep in mind, Chinese are using that camp.
[02:06:39.140 --> 02:06:40.781]  That's why I call it China camp.
[02:06:41.121 --> 02:06:47.106]  Not only do they use that camp, that's their main invasion route from South America, is the camp that Mayorkas built.
[02:06:47.626 --> 02:07:03.605]  I mean, with our money, with American money, that can't, that can't, okay, that was April 18th, 2022, when Mayorkas came, he had just come, either just before this or just after, because his security cars are not in that photo, but I made that video.
[02:07:03.645 --> 02:07:06.369]  And then, boom, we skip ahead to a few days ago and how big it is.
[02:07:07.247 --> 02:07:08.108]  Yeah, it's huge.
[02:07:08.488 --> 02:07:10.530]  And so, I mean, I'm down there all the time.
[02:07:10.911 --> 02:07:22.462]  And so, and the camps are, I want to say again, so that's the way it just was, and I want to say again that these camps not only are bigger, and this isn't the only one, there are others, we could go down this rabbit hole for hours.
[02:07:22.947 --> 02:07:25.788]  There are others, but more importantly, they're more efficient.
[02:07:26.128 --> 02:07:31.110]  The pipe is smooth, the pipe is fast, so the water is flowing faster and faster.
[02:07:31.530 --> 02:07:36.291]  So you've got, it's much easier for, and it's now, IOM, you know about IOM.
[02:07:36.431 --> 02:07:45.334]  Most people, almost every congressperson I ever, when Brett Weinstein first came down here, and Chris Martinson, they didn't know what IOM was just a couple of weeks ago, right?
[02:07:45.554 --> 02:07:50.436]  And I'm like, before you come down, you need to know who IOM is, because I'm gonna introduce you to IOM.
[02:07:50.876 --> 02:07:54.189]  And when you're in the airports coming down here, keep your eyes out for Iowans.
[02:07:54.209 --> 02:07:55.334]  So explain who the NGOs are.
[02:07:57.352 --> 02:08:02.834]  The International Organization for Migration, IOM, is run by an evil lady named Amy Pope.
[02:08:02.894 --> 02:08:05.395]  She's been in charge for maybe four, four and a half months.
[02:08:05.955 --> 02:08:09.616]  She brags that the number one funder for IOM is the United States.
[02:08:09.716 --> 02:08:10.836]  Number two is Germany.
[02:08:10.876 --> 02:08:11.997]  Number three is Canada.
[02:08:12.457 --> 02:08:17.738]  IOM also has an office in Yemen, by the way, and Yemenis do come through the Darien Gap.
[02:08:17.998 --> 02:08:22.880]  Now, IOM, their office, if I could turn this window 90 degrees, you would see their office.
[02:08:23.280 --> 02:08:26.262]  Their flag, I'm in what's called the City of Knowledge.
[02:08:26.783 --> 02:08:29.985]  I'm in the City of Knowledge in Panama, right?
[02:08:30.425 --> 02:08:32.447]  And so this used to be the U.S.
[02:08:32.507 --> 02:08:33.568]  Army South Headquarters.
[02:08:33.928 --> 02:08:35.309]  Now it's called the City of Knowledge.
[02:08:35.669 --> 02:08:36.570]  They've taken it over.
[02:08:36.850 --> 02:08:40.933]  About 62 NGOs, IGOs, and nonprofits.
[02:08:41.774 --> 02:08:50.560]  A very kind lady named Heather, I won't say her last name, she's an Intel lady, did a lot of study on this and she has reached out to Harrison about coming on to present this.
[02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:53.522]  She's done a great deal of research about the City of Knowledge.
[02:08:53.922 --> 02:08:58.085]  So anyway, IOM has the best office space in the City of Knowledge.
[02:08:58.365 --> 02:09:01.407]  And again, if I could turn this window 90 degrees, you would see their office.
[02:09:01.627 --> 02:09:02.347]  I can walk through it.
[02:09:02.387 --> 02:09:03.168]  Here's the bottom line.
[02:09:03.188 --> 02:09:04.609]  I want to come back and talk about how we stopped this.
[02:09:05.109 --> 02:09:07.771]  You have multinational governments headed up by the U.S.
[02:09:07.831 --> 02:09:08.471]  and the U.N.
[02:09:08.911 --> 02:09:11.153]  literally setting up invasion points all over the world.
[02:09:11.693 --> 02:09:19.942]  While they cut off the resources of the third world, flood us with these people who they then politically control, who they sign up for welfare, you name it, and skim money off of.
[02:09:20.362 --> 02:09:26.148]  This is a UN globalist invasion run by our own government happening in our face.
[02:09:27.569 --> 02:09:28.270]  Right, it is.
[02:09:28.390 --> 02:09:29.371]  It's a straight up invasion.
[02:09:29.611 --> 02:09:30.212]  It's hardcore.
[02:09:30.953 --> 02:09:33.636]  You know, and it's being done by the United States government.
[02:09:34.372 --> 02:09:43.124]  I mean it's it's it's uh it's also in Europe when you go to Europe like we've gone down to Morocco and Lithuania all over Europe you know Luxembourg.
[02:09:43.565 --> 02:09:49.012]  Let's come back and talk about what happened to Europe and how they're a little bit ahead of us on this and where this endgame goes and we don't stop it but...
[02:09:49.913 --> 02:09:52.514]  Again, Congress is only the point of the border's broken.
[02:09:52.794 --> 02:09:54.574]  Remember the last few years, New Yorkers, it's not broken.
[02:09:54.594 --> 02:09:55.654]  Now it's okay, it's broken.
[02:09:55.694 --> 02:09:56.374]  Legalize everybody.
[02:09:56.954 --> 02:10:00.055]  So, we need to get to the point of, no, our government's running this.
[02:10:00.615 --> 02:10:01.815]  And then that cuts the funding.
[02:10:02.296 --> 02:10:06.936]  And that's what this whole discussion's about, folks, is actually cutting the State Department money off.
[02:10:07.257 --> 02:10:08.977]  Michael Yawn, investigative journalist, is our guest.
[02:10:09.317 --> 02:10:11.097]  He's in Panama, just came out of the jungle.
[02:10:11.577 --> 02:10:12.278]  He's amazing.
[02:10:12.818 --> 02:10:14.258]  Tell everybody you know and those you don't know.
[02:10:14.298 --> 02:10:15.538]  Tell everybody, tune in now.
[02:10:15.958 --> 02:10:17.179]  They don't want this information getting out.
[02:10:17.639 --> 02:10:19.399]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:10:19.939 --> 02:10:24.563]  29 years on air, all I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalists.
[02:10:25.263 --> 02:10:30.587]  And I've done the best job I can to tell the truth and be accurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[02:10:30.987 --> 02:10:38.353]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves, unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people, we don't do that.
[02:10:38.813 --> 02:10:40.714]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[02:10:41.075 --> 02:10:43.737]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product, it's so powerful.
[02:10:44.637 --> 02:10:49.639]  This is the breakdown product, after your cells process it, of folic acid.
[02:10:50.199 --> 02:10:54.681]  Methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[02:10:55.161 --> 02:10:56.402]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[02:10:56.442 --> 02:10:57.262]  It's not a stimulant.
[02:10:57.542 --> 02:11:02.424]  It energizes your cells and then everything else you take just supercharges it.
[02:11:02.464 --> 02:11:03.304]  It's so insane.
[02:11:03.645 --> 02:11:05.165]  It's foundational energy.
[02:11:05.625 --> 02:11:07.146]  The strongest formula out there.
[02:11:08.147 --> 02:11:34.247]  Look, I know the regular listeners of this show are as informed as I am, some of you more informed depending on your perspective and where you live and where you work and what you see, but I am beyond frustrated because we have the keys to victory to stopping the globalists.
[02:11:34.983 --> 02:11:35.423]  The U.N.
[02:11:35.443 --> 02:11:37.545]  doesn't invade with troops and blue helmets.
[02:11:38.386 --> 02:11:39.467]  Oh, I ever see U.N.
[02:11:39.487 --> 02:11:41.348]  blue helmets, we always hear, I'm gonna get them.
[02:11:41.709 --> 02:11:44.191]  When that day comes, I'm ready, I got plenty of guns.
[02:11:45.432 --> 02:11:46.232]  They don't invade.
[02:11:46.252 --> 02:11:49.495]  They invade through the IMF, through the World Bank, through the policy.
[02:11:49.515 --> 02:11:57.222]  They're cutting off our pipelines, our infrastructure, flooding us with fentanyl, turning our families against each other, devaluing our dollar, launching all these wars.
[02:11:58.508 --> 02:12:02.430]  And, viral scares as well as, it's in all their own documents.
[02:12:02.450 --> 02:12:10.875]  In my film Endgame, I made in 2007, it says, their number one thing will be migrant flows, viruses, and currency crises to bring in world government.
[02:12:10.935 --> 02:12:17.178]  So, Congress still has been debating for three years with Mayorkas whether the border's broken.
[02:12:18.291 --> 02:12:21.793]  And they're finally gotten to, you're lying, we're impeaching you, it's broken, you're not doing your job.
[02:12:22.133 --> 02:12:24.294]  It's not that he's not doing his job.
[02:12:24.314 --> 02:12:32.239]  It's not like he's a fire department when a house is on fire and the fire department says we're going to eat chili and watch the football game and drink Miller Lite.
[02:12:33.079 --> 02:12:37.781]  That's dereliction of duty and that's criminal negligence and it's still wrong.
[02:12:38.882 --> 02:12:43.685]  But if the fire department went and set fire to the house, that's what we're talking about here.
[02:12:44.425 --> 02:12:49.183]   So, Mayorkas Took Obama's plan that he launched, the U.N.
[02:12:49.203 --> 02:12:49.523]  plan.
[02:12:49.944 --> 02:12:51.326]  Trump killed it, dead in a hammer.
[02:12:51.526 --> 02:12:52.287]  The numbers are there.
[02:12:52.307 --> 02:12:53.829]  Shut the border down 95%.
[02:12:53.969 --> 02:12:56.853]  War Patrol under good leadership did a great job.
[02:12:57.373 --> 02:12:59.216]  It has now exploded.
[02:12:59.456 --> 02:13:00.677]  But we all keep debating.
[02:13:02.017 --> 02:13:06.238]  Our giant, porous, 2,000 mile border, you can't defend that.
[02:13:06.658 --> 02:13:18.580]  You gotta defend it by cutting the money off to the industrial level smuggling with the airlines allowing it in, with the federal agencies bringing them in, and with the majority coming through up out of South America from all over the world.
[02:13:19.401 --> 02:13:25.862]  And that's what Michael Yan has been down there for years hammering, trying to get it on the agenda.
[02:13:26.798 --> 02:13:28.541]  You shut the Darien Gap down.
[02:13:28.581 --> 02:13:31.986]  You shut down the invasion point for South America, Central America.
[02:13:32.006 --> 02:13:33.828]  You shut most of this down.
[02:13:35.236 --> 02:13:37.116]  So Michael, we've talked about the problem.
[02:13:37.136 --> 02:13:38.877]  Every time you come on, you want to show them what's happening.
[02:13:39.217 --> 02:13:41.657]  You want to show them what's getting worse.
[02:13:41.677 --> 02:13:43.438]  A few years ago, you said, look, they built the camp.
[02:13:43.478 --> 02:13:44.658]  Now it's about to get a lot bigger.
[02:13:44.678 --> 02:13:45.258]  And then it did.
[02:13:45.318 --> 02:13:47.339]  And now they're going to build permanent bridges.
[02:13:47.399 --> 02:13:48.179]  And now they're building them.
[02:13:48.599 --> 02:13:51.580]  And you got the UN and Chinese and State Department signs.
[02:13:51.620 --> 02:13:53.660]  And we have the congressional funding doing it.
[02:13:53.980 --> 02:13:55.680]  And then again, I watched congressional hearings.
[02:13:56.241 --> 02:13:59.421]  Nothing about our government funding at all.
[02:13:59.481 --> 02:14:01.842]  Mayorkas, you sat on your hands.
[02:14:02.682 --> 02:14:03.302]  Well, this happened.
[02:14:03.342 --> 02:14:10.006]  So I guess the Republican leadership, I guess you're saying Greg Abbott, they do Kabuki theater or Iron Sheik versus Hulk Hogan.
[02:14:10.826 --> 02:14:12.707]  And that's all this is.
[02:14:13.167 --> 02:14:16.789]  And then meanwhile, I mean, all we got to do is cut the funding off.
[02:14:17.109 --> 02:14:20.171]  What would happen if the funding was cut and the U.S.
[02:14:20.191 --> 02:14:23.272]  government still has some control where Panama said, get rid of those bridges?
[02:14:23.512 --> 02:14:24.152]  What would happen?
[02:14:24.232 --> 02:14:25.013]  What needs to happen?
[02:14:26.092 --> 02:14:26.753]  Oh, it'd be simple.
[02:14:27.113 --> 02:14:32.860]  You'll often hear people saying, uh, we can't close the Darien Gap, which is complete nonsense, or we can't close the board.
[02:14:33.100 --> 02:14:35.323]  Nonsense, nonsense, nonsense.
[02:14:35.643 --> 02:14:38.567]  Anytime somebody says that, you know you're talking with a fool.
[02:14:39.027 --> 02:14:43.813]  Bottom line, the Darien Gap was closed, locked tight during the COVID lockdown.
[02:14:44.133 --> 02:14:44.874]  Nobody got through.
[02:14:45.154 --> 02:14:47.195]  This is child's play to close it down, right?
[02:14:47.495 --> 02:14:58.203]  You're not going to close down every bit of drugs that come through or whatever, but you're not going to have 10,000 or even 1,000 or even 100 people slip through per month if they're like Venezuelans and Chinese and whatnot.
[02:14:58.463 --> 02:14:59.304]  They're just not going to.
[02:14:59.344 --> 02:15:04.628]  There was 82,000 that we know of made it through the dairying gap just in August in one month, right?
[02:15:05.068 --> 02:15:10.392]  And so these numbers are constantly evolving though, because again, they don't all go through the dairying gap.
[02:15:10.672 --> 02:15:12.894]  You know, Mayorkas is not sitting on his hands.
[02:15:13.174 --> 02:15:15.276]  He is part of the invasion force, right?
[02:15:15.716 --> 02:15:17.418]  And you see them talking about it.
[02:15:17.478 --> 02:15:23.042]  They're doing the old Mao thing, the communist thing, which is talk, talk, talk, fight, fight, fight, right?
[02:15:23.062 --> 02:15:27.106]  They're like, well, it's time to have talks and fight, fight, fight, right?
[02:15:27.226 --> 02:15:31.890]  I mean, because that's the old... It's like the North Vietnamese were always having talks with us while they were kicking our ass.
[02:15:32.998 --> 02:15:33.779]  Talk, talk, talk.
[02:15:33.919 --> 02:15:34.659]  Fight, fight, fight.
[02:15:34.719 --> 02:15:37.041]  Or actually, they would say, talk, talk, fight, fight, right?
[02:15:37.181 --> 02:15:39.422]  It's a very effective strategy.
[02:15:39.702 --> 02:15:43.085]  When Israel and Hamas did their talks, I'm like, nonsense.
[02:15:43.305 --> 02:15:44.606]  That's talk, talk, fight, fight, right?
[02:15:44.926 --> 02:15:46.147]  And you can see that, right?
[02:15:47.227 --> 02:15:48.128]  It's the normal thing.
[02:15:48.168 --> 02:15:51.270]  Hey, we're going to have talks while we, you know, clean our weapons and get ready for the next battle.
[02:15:51.570 --> 02:15:54.411]  You know, and basically it will continue.
[02:15:54.752 --> 02:16:05.097]  And you see the same kayfabe, or let's say talk, talk, fight, fight going on every time Abbott and others say, hey, we're going to do something to show them what the pain is like.
[02:16:05.117 --> 02:16:08.418]  We're going to send some busloads or plane loads of people somewhere else.
[02:16:09.019 --> 02:16:12.240]  Again, he's just injecting the poison deeper into our hearts.
[02:16:12.620 --> 02:16:18.871]   This is a demographic war. It's obvious genocide is unfolding against Americans
[02:16:18.871 --> 02:16:22.980]   and Europeans and it will happen with Japanese as well. I could go on in great
[02:16:22.980 --> 02:16:23.740]  detail about that.
[02:16:23.740 --> 02:16:29.761]   I spent years in the Mayorkas and the weird group that brought him in that's
[02:16:29.761 --> 02:16:36.861]   such a big part of this this this NGO. Ohias, you know the Hebrew, that
[02:16:36.861 --> 02:16:40.601]   organization is quite interesting. They're all over the place in Darien,
[02:16:40.601 --> 02:16:44.081]   not just Darien, I see them in other places. I see them in Europe as well and
[02:16:44.081 --> 02:16:47.841]   and they're in the open. I eat lunch with them quite often in Darien because
[02:16:47.841 --> 02:16:52.201]  they're again I almost rented their office.
[02:16:50.418 --> 02:16:58.826]  That office right there, that gate that you're looking at, that's the gate I just walked through with Brett Weinstein and Chris Martinson like five days ago.
[02:16:58.906 --> 02:16:59.987]  We just walked through that.
[02:17:00.347 --> 02:17:05.092]  And I love how they don't want us to have walls, but they've got a wall in Constantino around their facility.
[02:17:06.107 --> 02:17:06.587]  That's right.
[02:17:06.708 --> 02:17:10.371]  I mean, that's literally that little office right there.
[02:17:10.391 --> 02:17:11.572]  It's a house that they rented.
[02:17:12.173 --> 02:17:16.277]  They eat lunch at a restaurant like 50 yards away, and I often eat lunch with them.
[02:17:16.637 --> 02:17:20.220]  But the highest people that are there, they're just gears in the machine.
[02:17:20.260 --> 02:17:21.101]  They don't even know what's going on.
[02:17:21.121 --> 02:17:21.421]  What's going on?
[02:17:21.441 --> 02:17:23.622]  You know, they're just the gear that does gear stuff, right?
[02:17:23.822 --> 02:17:27.204]  They don't know what, they don't even know that there are gear and a clock or what time it is.
[02:17:27.544 --> 02:17:36.308]  But the highest, the larger group like Catholic Charities and whatnot, those are, that is literally the Hebrew Immigration Assistance Society.
[02:17:36.688 --> 02:17:42.391]  That is, that camp is literally just like 30 seconds walk from the front gate of China Camp.
[02:17:42.791 --> 02:17:45.234]  They are literally helping the Chinese invasion.
[02:17:45.494 --> 02:17:46.054]  IS is.
[02:17:46.415 --> 02:17:47.636]  The Jewish group, right?
[02:17:47.856 --> 02:17:49.518]  Now, is it actually a Jewish group?
[02:17:49.998 --> 02:17:51.740]  Is Catholic Charities actually Catholic?
[02:17:52.120 --> 02:17:52.781]  I do not know.
[02:17:53.121 --> 02:17:55.263]  But if they don't denounce it, then they accept it.
[02:17:55.643 --> 02:18:02.810]  If the Pope doesn't denounce Catholic Charities, who's doing a huge amount of the invasion into Texas, I'm out with those people all the time, too.
[02:18:03.170 --> 02:18:05.593]  In places like McAllen, or even down in Mexico.
[02:18:06.533 --> 02:18:09.075]  If the Pope doesn't denounce it, he accepts it.
[02:18:09.295 --> 02:18:10.176]  Bottom line, right?
[02:18:10.276 --> 02:18:13.839]  I mean, why is Catholic Charities a huge part of the child smuggling?
[02:18:14.199 --> 02:18:18.402]  Why is HIAS, the Jewish organization, involved with child smuggling?
[02:18:18.722 --> 02:18:20.364]  Are they being denounced by...
[02:18:21.124 --> 02:18:22.124]  States like Israel.
[02:18:22.725 --> 02:18:23.025]  Are they?
[02:18:23.045 --> 02:18:24.005]  I haven't seen it.
[02:18:24.145 --> 02:18:24.905]  Maybe I missed it.
[02:18:25.225 --> 02:18:27.226]  That's one of the apps on the phones right there.
[02:18:27.946 --> 02:18:29.727]  Somebody in one of the camps showed me that.
[02:18:29.787 --> 02:18:31.167]  Might have been a Chinese guy, actually.
[02:18:31.747 --> 02:18:34.008]  And the Chinese have all kinds of apps.
[02:18:34.048 --> 02:18:35.929]  They're very organized in their invasion.
[02:18:36.429 --> 02:18:39.370]  Some of the groups coming through are very disorganized.
[02:18:39.830 --> 02:18:42.871]  Others, like the Chinese, I mean, they're methodical about it.
[02:18:42.911 --> 02:18:44.211]  They're very businesslike about it.
[02:18:44.511 --> 02:18:45.852]  Let me move to solutions.
[02:18:45.892 --> 02:18:53.232]   What do we need to do What's best case scenario versus what happens and we don't get control?
[02:18:53.252 --> 02:18:56.675]  Because you were coming on two years ago saying it's going to be exponential.
[02:18:56.735 --> 02:18:58.377]  You've called it dead on.
[02:18:58.757 --> 02:19:01.900]  That's the guess we have back is the people that call it dead on.
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:03.021]  So you called it dead on.
[02:19:03.702 --> 02:19:06.885]  You can either cover what we need to do first or the bad case scenario.
[02:19:08.766 --> 02:19:09.247]  It's our government.
[02:19:09.667 --> 02:19:11.489]  I mean, as long as this government's in charge.
[02:19:12.261 --> 02:19:13.141]  We're going to get more of it.
[02:19:13.461 --> 02:19:15.542]  I mean, you know, we can't address it.
[02:19:16.042 --> 02:19:18.924]  My good friend Todd Benspin, he's a border expert.
[02:19:18.964 --> 02:19:21.585]  We've been down to Mexico and all over the border together.
[02:19:21.605 --> 02:19:28.907]  It was Todd Benspin and I and others who helped get those big lawsuits kicked off at Colony Ridge, north of Houston.
[02:19:29.328 --> 02:19:30.708]  Todd is an expert on the border.
[02:19:30.728 --> 02:19:31.809]  I think he's been on your show.
[02:19:32.409 --> 02:19:35.630]  We disagree on how to treat countries like Panama.
[02:19:36.530 --> 02:19:38.951]  Todd thinks it has to be shut off down here, but it doesn't.
[02:19:38.971 --> 02:19:40.192]  It has to be shut off in Washington.
[02:19:41.347 --> 02:19:43.128]  I'm sorry, it has to be shut off in Davos.
[02:19:43.148 --> 02:19:44.548]  It has to be shut off in Geneva.
[02:19:44.568 --> 02:19:46.749]  It has to be shut off in Beijing, right?
[02:19:47.689 --> 02:19:49.170]  Sorry, I've been down in the jungle.
[02:19:49.210 --> 02:19:49.810]  No, I understand.
[02:19:50.610 --> 02:19:51.811]  And Trump's the guy to do it.
[02:19:51.991 --> 02:19:54.692]  Do you have faith in Trump if he gets in?
[02:19:56.913 --> 02:19:58.353]  You know, I have mixed feelings on Trump.
[02:19:58.453 --> 02:20:00.654]  I'm always very clear about what I think.
[02:20:00.754 --> 02:20:02.335]  I hate the jab part on Trump.
[02:20:02.375 --> 02:20:03.075]  Pushing the jab.
[02:20:03.985 --> 02:20:05.045]  Sorry, I'm not giving you a pass.
[02:20:05.065 --> 02:20:05.326]  Me too.
[02:20:05.366 --> 02:20:07.066]  But he can close the border.
[02:20:07.666 --> 02:20:09.987]  And he did not get us into any wars, which I agree.
[02:20:10.047 --> 02:20:11.728]  And our economy was smoking.
[02:20:11.828 --> 02:20:12.969]  It was doing good, right?
[02:20:13.529 --> 02:20:14.749]  And so these things were true.
[02:20:15.550 --> 02:20:17.230]  And so do I think Trump could do it?
[02:20:17.711 --> 02:20:21.032]  Well, let's just say I helped them out with the information, right?
[02:20:21.132 --> 02:20:21.892]  Yeah, they can do it.
[02:20:21.972 --> 02:20:23.813]  They can close down the Central American border.
[02:20:24.033 --> 02:20:24.493]  No problem.
[02:20:24.634 --> 02:20:25.354]  That's child's play.
[02:20:25.714 --> 02:20:27.236]  It just takes will to do it, right?
[02:20:27.436 --> 02:20:30.278]  First of all, you get rid of all these cabinet members and all these woke people.
[02:20:30.638 --> 02:20:32.219]  You purge the U.S.
[02:20:32.239 --> 02:20:32.420]  military.
[02:20:32.480 --> 02:20:33.200]  All right, stay there.
[02:20:33.220 --> 02:20:34.201]  You'll have the floor.
[02:20:34.261 --> 02:20:39.505]  Michael Yon, when we come back, and then when he leaves, we'll talk to Holtman, Cassandra, Steve, and Bart.
[02:20:39.665 --> 02:20:40.105]  Stay there.
[02:20:40.626 --> 02:20:42.487]  But I want you to come back and tell us about solutions.
[02:20:42.567 --> 02:20:45.269]  Michael Yon, the preeminent investigative journalist.
[02:20:45.289 --> 02:20:45.690]  Stay with us.
[02:20:46.270 --> 02:20:48.032]  Nobody is doing more important work.
[02:20:48.973 --> 02:21:00.236]  Then Michael Young, and I love Joe Rogan and he hates it if you recommend gas to a show because everybody does it, but I recommended Michael Young to him several times, but at least Brett Weinstein, I know, gets on there a lot.
[02:21:00.416 --> 02:21:20.825]   He can now go on there and talk about this, but this is, we already know this, it's all on record, but the footage can get the public to understand that our government, with the CHICOMS and the UN, Their signs are everywhere, the federal funding's there, it's on the records, they give them debit cards, it's all run by our criminal government.
[02:21:21.286 --> 02:21:25.429]  And again, Congress knows this, so Mike Leon is doing God's work here.
[02:21:26.110 --> 02:21:34.456]  In closing, my friend, I want to get Weinstein and others, you know, on as soon as they get back, and get you in the studio as soon as you're back.
[02:21:34.596 --> 02:21:37.778]  I know you live close to Austin, and we still need to go get dinner together.
[02:21:38.720 --> 02:21:40.122]  And I want to go down there soon as well.
[02:21:40.182 --> 02:21:42.445]  I'm just really tied down here in the wars that are going on.
[02:21:42.465 --> 02:21:44.607]  I'm trying to go to federal court Wednesday.
[02:21:44.647 --> 02:21:45.769]  I'm trying to not do that.
[02:21:46.209 --> 02:21:50.495]  But I'm pinned down here, kind of like a general in the back of the base.
[02:21:50.515 --> 02:21:51.556]  But I want to be out there with you.
[02:21:51.636 --> 02:21:54.760]  But you got cut off by the break.
[02:21:54.780 --> 02:21:55.781]  What are the solutions?
[02:21:56.222 --> 02:21:56.983]  How do we stop this?
[02:21:58.459 --> 02:22:06.025]  Well, it's extremely important that you come down and take one or two key people with you and I'll make sure everything goes smooth and you're not going to believe what you see.
[02:22:06.165 --> 02:22:08.046]  I know you travel and see a lot of stuff.
[02:22:08.447 --> 02:22:14.451]  This is one of those rare honey holes where you have great access and you're in the middle of everything, right?
[02:22:15.372 --> 02:22:15.932]  What to do?
[02:22:16.153 --> 02:22:18.054]  This is our government that's doing it, period.
[02:22:19.715 --> 02:22:22.317]  We've got to have a president who's going to stand strong.
[02:22:22.818 --> 02:22:23.298]  That's it.
[02:22:23.458 --> 02:22:24.699]  And it can be stopped.
[02:22:25.039 --> 02:22:27.281]  We have to clear out the top ranks of the military.
[02:22:27.341 --> 02:22:28.222]  They've been selected.
[02:22:28.682 --> 02:22:29.623]  They're woke.
[02:22:30.003 --> 02:22:31.184]  You know, I know some of them.
[02:22:31.344 --> 02:22:32.565]  I communicate with some of them.
[02:22:32.846 --> 02:22:34.407]  They will see what I'm saying now.
[02:22:34.487 --> 02:22:36.669]  And for some reason, we still communicate.
[02:22:36.989 --> 02:22:38.230]  But they need to be cleared out.
[02:22:39.410 --> 02:22:40.851]  They're part of the problem.
[02:22:41.431 --> 02:22:44.132]  And likewise, we got people like Mayorkas.
[02:22:44.332 --> 02:22:45.433]  He's a straight-up traitor.
[02:22:45.733 --> 02:22:47.754]  That is absolute treason, what he's doing.
[02:22:48.034 --> 02:22:49.694]  That is the proper word, right?
[02:22:50.074 --> 02:22:50.895]  Same with Blinken.
[02:22:51.215 --> 02:22:52.075]  A long list.
[02:22:52.155 --> 02:22:53.376]  We've got to get rid of them.
[02:22:53.596 --> 02:22:55.076]  They've got to be kicked out of office.
[02:22:55.356 --> 02:23:01.879]  And we've got to put, literally, as they used to say, put the adults back in charge when they were putting the children in charge.
[02:23:02.579 --> 02:23:13.992]  We really can stop this, and we really can reverse it, and we really must deport tens of millions of people, and I realize that's going to be dicey, and it's not going to be pretty, and we need to get on with it.
[02:23:14.272 --> 02:23:15.133]  We need to get to work.
[02:23:15.153 --> 02:23:18.357]  But if we don't, if we don't stop it, what's the master plan?
[02:23:18.877 --> 02:23:19.838]  What do we look like in 3, 5, 10 years?
[02:23:21.550 --> 02:23:22.191]  We will die.
[02:23:22.611 --> 02:23:25.751]  We will die. They will be kicking the heads down the road.
[02:23:25.751 --> 02:23:31.311]   These high testosterone guys coming across the Darien Gap, you know, they're watching Joe out there
[02:23:31.311 --> 02:23:35.561]   smoking dope and, you know, not doing anything. Sorry, Joe. That's why you never have me on your
[02:23:35.561 --> 02:23:37.571]  show. It's because I say stuff like that.
[02:23:37.571 --> 02:23:42.130]   But when you're out there smoking dope, Joe, and I asked Brett Weinstein the next time he sees you
[02:23:42.130 --> 02:23:47.490]   to please ask you to stop smoking dope on your show. We are in a state of war. You're around
[02:23:47.490 --> 02:23:52.290]   smoking dope. When these guys come into the Darien Gap, they're going to bust down your door.
[02:23:52.290 --> 02:23:55.730]   They're going to cut off your head and they're going to play soccer with it. That's the kind
[02:23:55.730 --> 02:24:01.010]   of people we're dealing with. This is no shit, right? It's time to get man hats on here.
[02:24:01.010 --> 02:24:05.970]   Get serious. It's on. By the way, I got some of the footage when you had the muckraker on the show,
[02:24:05.970 --> 02:24:07.091]  my show.
[02:24:07.282 --> 02:24:11.445]  There's whole groups of military Islamic men who aren't recruits.
[02:24:11.465 --> 02:24:17.069]  You can tell they're officers wearing the same boots, the same backpacks, not talking to the media, saying no cameras.
[02:24:17.369 --> 02:24:18.050]  You can see it.
[02:24:18.590 --> 02:24:24.654]  It looks like engineering brigades to me who are going to set up the technical operations, set up criminal operations to fund the next group.
[02:24:24.694 --> 02:24:27.877]  They're sending their officer corps in right now.
[02:24:29.358 --> 02:24:29.939]  Oh, clearly.
[02:24:30.099 --> 02:24:35.667]  And right now, Anthony, who was on your show, great show, you know, Anthony works hard.
[02:24:35.827 --> 02:24:38.891]  He and I were in the Dairy and Gap together and all over the U.S.
[02:24:38.951 --> 02:24:42.576]  border as well, and he's doing operations right now as we speak.
[02:24:42.616 --> 02:24:43.477]  He's been messaging me.
[02:24:44.258 --> 02:24:46.199]  Young men like that, force multiply.
[02:24:46.300 --> 02:24:50.883]  One time, Anthony and I were on your show, and you quickly identified exactly what was going on.
[02:24:51.183 --> 02:24:52.304]  Force multiplication.
[02:24:52.624 --> 02:24:57.708]  And I asked Anthony, I said, look, I'll take you out, I'll show you all kinds of stuff, show you how to do things.
[02:24:58.109 --> 02:25:00.030]  I asked you only one, two things.
[02:25:00.210 --> 02:25:01.391]  One is force multiply.
[02:25:01.631 --> 02:25:02.572]  Multiply yourself.
[02:25:03.032 --> 02:25:06.955]  And, you know, don't give the microphone to other, definitely give the microphone to other people.
[02:25:06.995 --> 02:25:08.036]  Don't hog the microphone.
[02:25:08.336 --> 02:25:09.677]  Do like Alex Jones does.
[02:25:09.958 --> 02:25:11.319]  Give the microphone out, right?
[02:25:11.679 --> 02:25:17.182]   And another thing is, Uh, tell people all the time, you're not laying around smoking dope.
[02:25:17.422 --> 02:25:22.004]  You're not laying around, uh, you know, uh, you know, woo, wow, this is bad.
[02:25:22.084 --> 02:25:23.164]  No, we gotta do something.
[02:25:23.304 --> 02:25:28.167]  We have to- those are the Syrians that Anthony was faced up- Anthony could have gotten hurt doing that.
[02:25:28.407 --> 02:25:29.707]  That's right in front of China Camp.
[02:25:30.007 --> 02:25:33.049]  Highest is like 50 meters away from him, 40 meters away.
[02:25:33.309 --> 02:25:38.331]  So that highest office you were showing earlier is on that road, like 40 yards away, right?
[02:25:38.531 --> 02:25:40.152]  I know, they all have the same boots.
[02:25:40.652 --> 02:25:46.252]  You can just look at those guys instantly and tell you, I would say that's technical computer engineer group going in.
[02:25:48.210 --> 02:25:49.271]  There's somebody serious.
[02:25:49.431 --> 02:25:51.572]  They had just walked by that fence, right?
[02:25:51.933 --> 02:25:52.953]  And you see it all the time.
[02:25:53.073 --> 02:25:55.355]  I mean, we see it literally many times per day.
[02:25:55.575 --> 02:25:58.757]  And again, Bret Weinstein and Chris Martenson just saw it.
[02:25:59.557 --> 02:26:01.278]  And I just messaged to Bret.
[02:26:01.518 --> 02:26:03.119]  Actually, they just responded.
[02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:05.181]  It looks like his son just responded.
[02:26:05.201 --> 02:26:06.021]  He's going to talk with him.
[02:26:06.762 --> 02:26:08.323]  I want to try to get Bret on your show.
[02:26:08.723 --> 02:26:14.186]  And because, you know, let him see it through his, as you know, he's been a very well-known progressive.
[02:26:14.286 --> 02:26:15.387]  You can see he's waking up.
[02:26:15.627 --> 02:26:16.428]  I mean, he can see it.
[02:26:17.328 --> 02:26:25.094]  He went on Turner Carlson two weeks ago and said they created the virus, they released it, they're setting up world government, they're getting ready to hit us again, they want a world treaty.
[02:26:25.515 --> 02:26:26.716]  This is unspeakably bad.
[02:26:26.776 --> 02:26:28.217]  Words cannot describe how evil it is.
[02:26:30.078 --> 02:26:31.139]  He's an intelligent man.
[02:26:31.319 --> 02:26:33.421]  He saw it for what it is, you know?
[02:26:34.002 --> 02:26:36.544]  And we spent a lot of time running around together in the jungle.
[02:26:36.584 --> 02:26:37.284]  And that's another point.
[02:26:37.324 --> 02:26:38.565]  We're going to find out who's good and bad here.
[02:26:38.585 --> 02:26:43.389]  There have been a lot of people that were deceived, and they're going to flip to our side like Elon Musk and others are right now.
[02:26:43.749 --> 02:26:46.592]  But a lot of people are going to find out we're on the enemy team.
[02:26:47.554 --> 02:26:50.036]  Brett's flipping to the team of truth.
[02:26:50.336 --> 02:26:51.537]  He can see it for what it is.
[02:26:51.997 --> 02:27:00.964]  And he, you know, he clearly thought that a lot of the things that I was saying probably sounded kind of crazy, but I started showing it to him and he's like, ah, I see it.
[02:27:01.284 --> 02:27:03.726]  It's really, actually, it's worse than you actually.
[02:27:04.506 --> 02:27:05.427]  You know how it is, Alex.
[02:27:05.587 --> 02:27:12.550]   You can say it on your show and it sounds like hyperbole, but then you take somebody to these places and they're like, It's actually worse when you're making out.
[02:27:12.550 --> 02:27:16.550]   If you go to the Texas border, video doesn't describe it because video is only one perspective.
[02:27:16.550 --> 02:27:19.050]  When you're there, it's just all around you.
[02:27:19.050 --> 02:27:23.550]   You can't even, there's so many vans and trucks and buses and helicopters and planes taking off.
[02:27:23.550 --> 02:27:26.550]  You're just, you're like in Richard's Carry Busytown.
[02:27:26.550 --> 02:27:27.550]  It's like you can't even.
[02:27:27.550 --> 02:27:28.550]  Oh yeah.
[02:27:28.550 --> 02:27:29.550]  It is.
[02:27:29.550 --> 02:27:30.550]  It is.
[02:27:31.220 --> 02:27:31.540]  It is.
[02:27:32.080 --> 02:27:34.642]  And I really desperately want to get you down here, Alex.
[02:27:34.702 --> 02:27:35.943]  It's extremely important.
[02:27:36.043 --> 02:27:44.049]  Because also, we all have different perspectives and different backgrounds, and you have a background that's highly informed on this subject.
[02:27:44.409 --> 02:27:50.494]  So you're going to see things, even with all the amount of time I've spent down here, you're going to see things I didn't actually notice yet.
[02:27:50.774 --> 02:28:06.088]  Which is one of the reasons I take key people down here and show them everything and then usually about a week or two or three weeks later, a month later, when it really all settles with them and they've had a time to sleep on it, then they start putting pieces together and they start sending me really important messages.
[02:28:06.348 --> 02:28:13.912]  Well, we know what it is, a global government UN takeover, destroying sovereignty of nations period, run by our own government that set up the UN.
[02:28:14.052 --> 02:28:15.493]  This is the endgame of the New World Order.
[02:28:15.853 --> 02:28:21.036]  Michael Yan, people can find all your amazing work on X, and we really appreciate you.
[02:28:21.136 --> 02:28:25.759]  Michael Yan, at Michael underscore Yan, on X, MichaelYan.com.
[02:28:27.440 --> 02:28:30.141]  Whoever you want on the show, you tell my producers, load them up.
[02:28:31.522 --> 02:28:32.042]  Thank you, sir.
[02:28:32.383 --> 02:28:33.783]  I'll send some good people your way.
[02:28:33.903 --> 02:28:34.344]  Thank you, sir.
[02:28:34.364 --> 02:28:34.584]  Love you.
[02:28:35.959 --> 02:28:36.539]  Alright, folks.
[02:28:36.919 --> 02:28:38.420]  Oh my God, it's so frustrating.
[02:28:38.440 --> 02:28:42.261]  Every one time I watch these congressional hearings, not a word about the UN bases.
[02:28:43.221 --> 02:28:44.382]  That's where they bring them to.
[02:28:44.422 --> 02:28:45.402]  That's the springboard.
[02:28:45.822 --> 02:28:48.663]  You take those out by taking the funding out, you beat it.
[02:28:49.664 --> 02:28:52.785]  Instead, we're trying to beat it once it comes into the country.
[02:28:54.925 --> 02:28:58.507]  That's like... It's just so frustrating.
[02:28:58.867 --> 02:28:59.527]  We're going to go to break.
[02:29:00.743 --> 02:29:06.046]  And I'm going to take a little bit of slant this time, you understand, because I promise I'm going to go to Steve, Bart, Hulkman, and Cassandra.
[02:29:06.066 --> 02:29:07.967]  If I don't do this, we won't be here.
[02:29:08.007 --> 02:29:09.087]  Plus, these are products you need.
[02:29:09.428 --> 02:29:10.608]  Look, I need funds, folks.
[02:29:11.249 --> 02:29:12.289]  You know why I haven't gone down there with him?
[02:29:12.309 --> 02:29:16.491]  Because I can't fund to take a few security guys, and nobody's going to let me go without security.
[02:29:16.531 --> 02:29:17.012]  I got to have it.
[02:29:17.212 --> 02:29:19.973]  I love to hang my ass out there, but I got to go with some security.
[02:29:20.173 --> 02:29:20.974]  I don't have money to travel.
[02:29:20.994 --> 02:29:21.894]  I don't have money to do anything.
[02:29:22.234 --> 02:29:24.496]   Now they finally admit in the media Jones has nothing!
[02:29:24.556 --> 02:29:25.116]  Ha ha ha!
[02:29:25.176 --> 02:29:26.737]  He sold his car, he sold his guns.
[02:29:27.397 --> 02:29:27.557]  Oh!
[02:29:27.837 --> 02:29:29.238]  Like I give a damn about any of that.
[02:29:29.518 --> 02:29:33.501]  I care about the truth and justice, but I need funds.
[02:29:33.841 --> 02:29:35.102]  InfoWars needs funds.
[02:29:35.722 --> 02:29:36.062]  Okay?
[02:29:36.722 --> 02:29:49.474]   So, if you want to keep us on air and see us go everywhere, like we did at Bilderberg and Davos before and everything else, If you want to put a dog in the fight, you gotta have a badass pit bull that's won like 20 fights.
[02:29:49.494 --> 02:29:50.895]  I'm not defending dog fighting, but you know what I mean.
[02:29:51.135 --> 02:29:52.596]  You gotta have a rooster that's won 50 fights.
[02:29:52.756 --> 02:29:56.377]  If you don't feed the damn rooster for a couple weeks, you're gonna go out there and the rooster's gonna be dead, okay?
[02:29:56.857 --> 02:30:01.819]  So I'm a rooster that's already won a bunch of fights, and I want to get back in there and tear up some other cocks.
[02:30:02.279 --> 02:30:05.380]  But I can't do it unless you feed me the damn chicken feed, alright?
[02:30:05.900 --> 02:30:11.342]   And I'm not complaining, I'm not bitching, I'm just saying, I want to attack in the InfoWar.
[02:30:11.422 --> 02:30:12.903]  I want to go for their juggler.
[02:30:13.343 --> 02:30:17.085]  But if you don't give the pitbull water and food, he's going to be dead.
[02:30:17.726 --> 02:30:18.566]  So I'm not bitching.
[02:30:20.167 --> 02:30:22.608]  Just get products you need at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:30:22.828 --> 02:30:24.609]  And most of the products I get no money from.
[02:30:24.649 --> 02:30:29.091]  But my book, The Great Awakening, is where we have a signed copy that's a fundraiser.
[02:30:29.111 --> 02:30:30.512]  The unsigned, I get some of the money.
[02:30:31.133 --> 02:30:32.613]  The platinum products that are amazing.
[02:30:33.934 --> 02:30:34.954]  HH Max Boost.
[02:30:36.724 --> 02:30:40.906]  And, 1776 Tassarum Boost and Pain MD, they're amazing products.
[02:30:41.366 --> 02:30:51.790]  I'm not going to go into the bankruptcy and why it happened, but when I sold my house, the court will be putting some of my money in to buy products that I can get some of the money back myself, so I'll put my own money in to get these, because I know they're great, and it funds us.
[02:30:51.930 --> 02:30:52.991]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:30:53.991 --> 02:30:54.792]  Winter is coming.

[02:31:14.911 --> 02:31:17.390]  Winter is coming.
[02:31:17.390 --> 02:31:19.191]  Winter isn't coming.
[02:31:19.591 --> 02:31:20.892]  Winter is here.

[02:32:11.422 --> 02:32:17.061]   and I appreciate you holding on this live Monday, January 22nd, 2024 transmission.
[02:32:17.313 --> 02:32:19.714]  Bart in Georgia, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[02:32:21.134 --> 02:32:26.577]  Yeah, so I'm thinking about this coffee, the WEF wants to cut up our coffee.
[02:32:26.637 --> 02:32:29.479]  Well, I buy my coffee by the year.
[02:32:29.759 --> 02:32:33.301]  Don't buy just a bag of Alex Jones' Wake Up America.
[02:32:34.321 --> 02:32:35.242]  Buy it by the year.
[02:32:35.262 --> 02:32:38.023]  And I got one more thing to say, Alex.
[02:32:39.011 --> 02:32:42.437]  Have you considered Alex Jones cartoon?
[02:32:42.917 --> 02:32:46.543]  Get to these kids and counteract Drag Queen Story Time.
[02:32:46.824 --> 02:32:51.471]  These little kids will be begging their parents to buy Alex Jones cereal.
[02:32:53.001 --> 02:33:05.950]  Listen, what conservatives and Christians and populists should do is set up 1776 Christian clubs because if they're going to let Satanists into the schools to have Satan hour, no one's going to want to go to that except their pedo parents.
[02:33:06.430 --> 02:33:07.471]  And I never got to that today.
[02:33:07.491 --> 02:33:07.791]  I meant to.
[02:33:07.811 --> 02:33:08.852]  There's a bunch of news on that.
[02:33:09.352 --> 02:33:16.336]   We should have 1776 and Christian clubs because you can't have a state-run school It's officially Christian.
[02:33:16.616 --> 02:33:18.077]  But Christians can have their own clubs.
[02:33:18.397 --> 02:33:20.698]  So the answer is Christians need to set up clubs.
[02:33:21.558 --> 02:33:24.559]  And we need to have 1776 civics clubs.
[02:33:25.419 --> 02:33:26.339]  That's a great idea.
[02:33:26.459 --> 02:33:30.600]  And yeah, people like Alex Jones, they should set up InfoWars clubs in the schools.
[02:33:31.101 --> 02:33:36.602]  They've got federal programs teaching elementary students and middle school students how bad Alex Jones is.
[02:33:37.622 --> 02:33:38.943]  Which, they don't know reverse psychology.
[02:33:38.983 --> 02:33:40.363]  It'll just make the kids want to go look us up.
[02:33:40.403 --> 02:33:42.004]  But that's a great point, sir.
[02:33:42.024 --> 02:33:42.424]  Anything else?
[02:33:43.755 --> 02:33:45.296]  Yeah, I just want everybody to go.
[02:33:45.336 --> 02:33:49.997]  I put up the Alex Jones Show on the Bart Fine Channel on Rumble and Biscuit.
[02:33:50.057 --> 02:33:54.038]  And, um, just watch the Alex Jones Show on the Bart Fine Channel, please.
[02:33:54.658 --> 02:33:56.958]   And your phone's ringing a little bit. Well, what's the name of the channel?
[02:33:56.958 --> 02:33:59.718]  Bart's Fine on Rumble and 50.
[02:33:59.718 --> 02:34:03.038]  All right. Thank you so much, sir. Bart's Fine.
[02:34:03.038 --> 02:34:06.658]  Let's talk to Cassandra in California, then Stephen Holtman.
[02:34:06.658 --> 02:34:07.558]  Cassandra, go ahead.
[02:34:07.558 --> 02:34:11.837]  Hi Alex. Thank you for taking my call.
[02:34:11.837 --> 02:34:14.977]   I'm I'm calling about Michael Yan.
[02:34:15.357 --> 02:34:31.926]  He has been spot on for years and I was telling your producer there about maybe another solution is setting up a teletron, having Michael Yan's videos of what's going on down in Panama.
[02:34:32.739 --> 02:34:39.865]  Oh yeah, somebody needs to finance just five minute rotating videos on those panel trucks to park out front the Congress.
[02:34:41.187 --> 02:34:41.447]  Yes!
[02:34:41.827 --> 02:34:42.728]  How about Congress?
[02:34:42.748 --> 02:34:45.590]  How about these congressmen that are sitting there shut the border?
[02:34:45.891 --> 02:34:47.572]  Why don't we make them pay for it?
[02:34:47.752 --> 02:34:53.698]  And again, you don't shut the border at the border, you shut it when your own government's funding it with UN camps!
[02:34:54.659 --> 02:34:57.221]  Well, a lot of people don't realize that.
[02:34:57.261 --> 02:34:59.122]  And another thing, people are waking up.
[02:34:59.222 --> 02:35:12.530]  I take my phone and as I'm shopping and stuff, especially in the produce section, I have your program on and various other programs and people stop me and ask me who I'm listening to.
[02:35:12.550 --> 02:35:15.092]  Oh yeah, people are really interested in freedom.
[02:35:15.962 --> 02:35:20.724]  Oh yeah, and the cashier at my local grocery store, oh, you're listening to Alex?
[02:35:20.824 --> 02:35:22.104]  I go, yeah, you know him?
[02:35:23.965 --> 02:35:29.647]  So people know you, and I'm in a little small town in Southern California, but it's growing really fast.
[02:35:29.787 --> 02:35:39.311]  Well, that's why you should wear a t-shirt or play my show or other shows, because you find out really, black people, old people, young people, you find out how popular freedom is, you're like, wow, we're not alone here.
[02:35:40.117 --> 02:35:41.138]  No, we're not alone.
[02:35:41.358 --> 02:35:47.122]  We have a little patriot parade of cars every two weeks that goes through here.
[02:35:47.142 --> 02:35:50.845]  Well, we ought to show our numbers.
[02:35:50.885 --> 02:35:53.247]  That's why I tell the story all the time, not to say, oh, I'm popular.
[02:35:53.267 --> 02:35:56.809]  No, no, I'm saying most people aren't known, so you don't know how popular Freedom is.
[02:35:57.210 --> 02:35:58.591]  I get nothing but love now everywhere.
[02:35:59.071 --> 02:36:02.093]  I mean, I literally go to restaurants, I say, can I sit in the back corner?
[02:36:02.513 --> 02:36:03.654]  Still 20 people come over.
[02:36:04.074 --> 02:36:05.114]  And again, it's not about me.
[02:36:05.174 --> 02:36:06.195]  It's that freedom is popular.
[02:36:06.215 --> 02:36:07.235]  They go, oh, that's Alex Jones.
[02:36:07.556 --> 02:36:08.196]  It's not about me.
[02:36:08.256 --> 02:36:10.677]  It's showing they see a mirror of who they are.
[02:36:10.997 --> 02:36:12.778]  We don't realize how strong we are.
[02:36:14.399 --> 02:36:15.100]  Exactly.
[02:36:15.780 --> 02:36:22.026]   Well, I'm waiting for my my T-shirt from you and Must.
[02:36:22.166 --> 02:36:22.886]  Elon.
[02:36:23.406 --> 02:36:27.408]  By the way, by the way, for some reason, we ordered a month ago, Christmas, a week behind.
[02:36:27.488 --> 02:36:28.108]  It is in.
[02:36:28.508 --> 02:36:29.868]  It arrived yesterday.
[02:36:29.948 --> 02:36:30.969]  It's now shipping.
[02:36:31.269 --> 02:36:33.049]  The Team Humanity, because I told them, I said, wear it.
[02:36:33.069 --> 02:36:34.410]  They go, well, it's in Denver at the warehouse.
[02:36:34.450 --> 02:36:35.390]  I went, well, get me one.
[02:36:35.810 --> 02:36:37.511]  Just today, I'm like, get me the shirt now.
[02:36:37.551 --> 02:36:38.131]  I want to wear it.
[02:36:38.411 --> 02:36:39.291]  So thank you so much.
[02:36:39.371 --> 02:36:40.352]  I really appreciate you.
[02:36:40.372 --> 02:36:41.532]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[02:36:42.392 --> 02:36:45.213]  Back in 60 seconds, I'm going to go to Steven Indiana quickly and then Hulk Man.
[02:36:45.233 --> 02:36:47.754]  We're going to skip both network breaks.
[02:36:48.976 --> 02:36:51.157]  So Gerald Cilente doesn't just get his time back, he gets more.
[02:36:51.737 --> 02:36:57.219]  So I'll do like four or five minutes on calls and then Gerald Cilente, the top trends forecaster, takes over.
[02:36:57.259 --> 02:36:57.860]  Want to support us?
[02:36:58.180 --> 02:37:01.981]  Get a discount on his amazing magazine at his site.
[02:37:03.082 --> 02:37:03.962]  Yeah!
[02:37:04.942 --> 02:37:06.683]  Steve at Indiana, you're on the air.
[02:37:06.883 --> 02:37:07.764]  Go ahead, welcome.
[02:37:09.104 --> 02:37:10.345]  Hey Alex, how you doing today, sir?
[02:37:10.365 --> 02:37:10.725]  Good, brother.
[02:37:10.765 --> 02:37:11.285]  Thanks for calling.
[02:37:12.245 --> 02:37:14.826]  Hey, number one, I just want to say it's an honor to speak to you.
[02:37:14.846 --> 02:37:17.687]  I'm shaking as I'm speaking to you, but I'm a little nervous.
[02:37:17.747 --> 02:37:18.907]  Well, I love you, brother.
[02:37:19.608 --> 02:37:24.209]  I want to encourage you because, number one, you put everything on the line for us, for all of us.
[02:37:24.449 --> 02:37:29.091]  And the message, the gentleman I called earlier, Jimmy, this is what prompted me to call in.
[02:37:29.871 --> 02:37:32.052]  If we don't share information, then nobody knows.
[02:37:32.553 --> 02:37:36.855]  The media, what they want us to actually do, is to do nothing.
[02:37:37.175 --> 02:37:42.238]  Not research anything, not listen to anything, just be spoon-fed by what the media is telling us.
[02:37:42.779 --> 02:37:45.560]  You know, and evil will prevail when good men do nothing.
[02:37:46.080 --> 02:37:54.155]   And that's, you know, that's what I would tell Jimmy, is just that, you know, he's going to have to But on his big boy pants because we're in a battle here.
[02:37:54.155 --> 02:37:59.134]   This is spiritual battle It's we had to pick sides and being aggressive and pulling
[02:37:59.134 --> 02:38:02.494]   up arms That's something you do as a last resort what you're doing
[02:38:02.494 --> 02:38:09.295]   is sharing information and let us know what's going on And I my issue was he said you're not calling for violence
[02:38:09.295 --> 02:38:13.694]   And then I said well, then who are we supposed to attack and he said I'm not gonna answer that
[02:38:13.694 --> 02:38:19.514]   So he wants me. I really don't think violence is the answer because they're just gonna spin it around
[02:38:20.373 --> 02:38:22.373]  You know, I mean...
[02:38:22.022 --> 02:38:23.884]  It's a cultural change in saying no.
[02:38:23.924 --> 02:38:28.408]  That's where most good revolutions come out of a cultural revolution.
[02:38:28.768 --> 02:38:29.889]  You're absolutely right.
[02:38:29.949 --> 02:38:33.012]  It's like Gandhi proved that point.
[02:38:33.032 --> 02:38:36.555]  I'm not saying I support Gandhi, I'm just saying you could do a lot more.
[02:38:36.855 --> 02:38:38.716]  Gandhi wasn't perfect, but he was right.
[02:38:38.736 --> 02:38:40.318]  The way he did it was good.
[02:38:40.518 --> 02:38:43.957]  Yes, oh yes, and cooler heads will prevail.
[02:38:43.957 --> 02:38:44.958]  And last thing we need to do is get back to the bar.
[02:38:44.958 --> 02:38:47.718]   And by the way, I don't know if Gandhi was wrong about the British Empire.
[02:38:47.718 --> 02:38:52.436]   He was pro-Islamic and allowed an invasion of their country, and they almost lost their
[02:38:52.436 --> 02:38:56.157]   country and now that's caused the backlash with Modi and the rest of it.
[02:38:56.157 --> 02:38:57.157]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:38:57.157 --> 02:39:02.037]   Well, you know, with all this right now, especially with the World Economic Forum, you know, getting
[02:39:02.037 --> 02:39:05.757]   together here last week, you know, it's, they want us to be spoon-fed.
[02:39:05.757 --> 02:39:07.317]  And if you--
[02:39:06.858 --> 02:39:12.202]  Anybody that has, you know, even a third-grade education understands what we're up against right now.
[02:39:12.683 --> 02:39:15.625]  Information is being fed to us that is propaganda.
[02:39:15.725 --> 02:39:20.889]  It's meant for us to just stay silent and not do anything, just like Jimmy wants to do, and it's okay.
[02:39:21.250 --> 02:39:22.751]  You know, this is what I tell those kind of people.
[02:39:24.029 --> 02:39:31.432]  There's people out there that want to stand up and care about our freedom and love this nation and love the people that, you know, that fought for this right for us to speak.
[02:39:31.832 --> 02:39:33.333]  I'm not going to let somebody take it away.
[02:39:33.633 --> 02:39:35.193]  And that doesn't mean I'm going to be aggressive.
[02:39:35.574 --> 02:39:37.034]  I mean, I'm training Krav Magaul.
[02:39:37.054 --> 02:39:38.135]  I'm not a non-aggressive person.
[02:39:38.215 --> 02:39:39.235]  I'm trained not to fight.
[02:39:39.715 --> 02:39:42.156]  And I'm trained to be, to reason, to think.
[02:39:42.596 --> 02:39:46.958]  And that's what they don't want from us, is think and to keep the cooler heads, because we will prevail.
[02:39:47.138 --> 02:39:47.738]  We're going to prevail.
[02:39:49.839 --> 02:39:50.780]  I totally agree with you.
[02:39:50.820 --> 02:39:53.461]  And look, violence is the last resort.
[02:39:54.121 --> 02:39:55.902]  And if you need to use it, you need to know how to do it.
[02:39:56.662 --> 02:40:01.304]  So I know how to hit somebody in the head with a baseball bat or shoot somebody at 500 yards with a rifle.
[02:40:01.845 --> 02:40:03.866]  Or shoot somebody 10 feet away with a shotgun.
[02:40:04.266 --> 02:40:06.147]  I'm trying to live a life where I don't have to do that.
[02:40:06.647 --> 02:40:07.787]  Yeah, we don't need violence, but we need justice.
[02:40:07.807 --> 02:40:08.227]  That's what we need.
[02:40:08.046 --> 02:40:09.965]  I'm gonna wait for the UN troops to come.
[02:40:09.965 --> 02:40:11.485]  They're not gonna come that way, folks.
[02:40:11.485 --> 02:40:14.486]   They're coming with inflation and open borders and fentanyl deaths.
[02:40:14.486 --> 02:40:15.326]  Thanks for the call.
[02:40:15.326 --> 02:40:19.686]   All right, Gerald's about to take over in two minutes, but first, Hulk, man, you're our telegunner from New York.
[02:40:19.686 --> 02:40:20.526]  Go ahead.
[02:40:20.526 --> 02:40:23.885]  Yeah, we don't need violence, but we need justice.
[02:40:23.885 --> 02:40:24.806]  That's what we need.
[02:40:24.806 --> 02:40:31.245]   And we have to form an anti-tyranny task force and go to all 50 states.
[02:40:31.556 --> 02:40:38.178]  I suggest using the soldiers that signed that petition for accountability for the poison death shots that are rolled out.
[02:40:38.678 --> 02:40:40.398]  We have the crime.
[02:40:40.958 --> 02:40:41.959]  We have the evidence.
[02:40:42.299 --> 02:40:43.299]  We have the criminals.
[02:40:43.819 --> 02:40:46.720]  Now we just have to form an anti-tyranny task force.
[02:40:47.228 --> 02:40:53.833]  And all of them have to sign sworn affidavits, just on what transpired during the COVID-19 pandemic.
[02:40:53.933 --> 02:41:01.058]  No, I agree with you that it's duty that once we take the country back, we have a Nuremberg 2, and the people that... Oh, right now.
[02:41:01.338 --> 02:41:01.858]  Right now.
[02:41:01.938 --> 02:41:02.499]  We can't wait.
[02:41:02.819 --> 02:41:03.399]  We can't wait.
[02:41:03.539 --> 02:41:03.919]  It's done.
[02:41:03.980 --> 02:41:04.380]  It's over.
[02:41:04.400 --> 02:41:05.200]  The evidence is out there.
[02:41:05.220 --> 02:41:06.061]  We have to save lives.
[02:41:06.141 --> 02:41:08.102]  Kids in college are still being forced to take this.
[02:41:08.483 --> 02:41:11.925]  There's people that are still brainwashed, and they're still going along with this protocol of death.
[02:41:12.321 --> 02:41:13.502]  We have no more time, sir.
[02:41:13.782 --> 02:41:14.722]  This has to happen now.
[02:41:14.742 --> 02:41:15.222]  No, you're right.
[02:41:15.362 --> 02:41:23.306]  I am not for offensive violence, but them pushing the shots, they're attacking us, and so they're really crossing the Rubicon there.
[02:41:23.366 --> 02:41:24.947]  They crossed it legally and lawfully.
[02:41:24.967 --> 02:41:27.328]  They all have to sign sworn affidavits at this point.
[02:41:27.368 --> 02:41:29.109]  The crime is already out there.
[02:41:29.369 --> 02:41:33.051]  They instituted the Various Use Authorization Act under false pretense.
[02:41:33.473 --> 02:41:34.374]  I appreciate your call.
[02:41:34.434 --> 02:41:35.054]  I'm out of time.
[02:41:34.913 --> 02:41:40.473]   That alone, that alone, our military guys, you got to form an anti-tyranny task force,
[02:41:40.473 --> 02:41:44.592]   you got to get lawyers, get together with local law enforcement, and you go to all 50
[02:41:44.592 --> 02:41:50.193]   states and everybody that was involved with this has to be freaking tried and brought
[02:41:50.193 --> 02:41:51.193]  to justice.
[02:41:51.193 --> 02:41:54.193]   We need justice, we need it right now, we need it today, we need it yesterday.
[02:41:54.193 --> 02:41:56.153]  Alright, Hulkman, I appreciate your call.
[02:41:56.153 --> 02:41:57.432]  I'm out of time, call me back.
[02:41:57.432 --> 02:42:00.632]   Alright, skipping the network break, Cheryl Celente gets his time back with a great trends
[02:42:00.632 --> 02:42:01.632]  forecaster.
[02:42:01.632 --> 02:42:03.632]  Thank you so much, Cheryl Celente.
[02:42:03.574 --> 02:42:04.575]  Tell us what's breaking.
[02:42:06.116 --> 02:42:11.841]  Oh, what's breaking is World War III and what's going on.
[02:42:11.921 --> 02:42:15.885]  I mean, people have no idea about it and how serious this is.
[02:42:15.905 --> 02:42:26.134]  The Israel war keeps expanding, you know, bombs away in Lebanon, bombs away in Syria, bombs away, you know, knocking out Iranians.
[02:42:26.932 --> 02:42:29.013]  United States bombing Yemen.
[02:42:29.473 --> 02:42:32.353]  Totally against, totally against talking about the Constitution.
[02:42:32.674 --> 02:42:33.494]  What Constitution?
[02:42:33.514 --> 02:42:34.334]  It's a piece of crap.
[02:42:34.394 --> 02:42:34.994]  Throw it away.
[02:42:35.434 --> 02:42:36.034]  I'm in charge.
[02:42:36.094 --> 02:42:36.855]  I'm the President.
[02:42:37.475 --> 02:42:38.035]  I'm Biden.
[02:42:38.075 --> 02:42:39.435]  I'll bomb anybody I want.
[02:42:39.915 --> 02:42:40.836]  Screw the Congress.
[02:42:41.296 --> 02:42:42.436]  Screw everybody else.
[02:42:43.676 --> 02:42:44.477]  I'll do what I want.
[02:42:44.617 --> 02:42:45.597]  Doesn't mean anything.
[02:42:46.197 --> 02:42:49.518]  And you know, InfoWars, I go into InfoWars every day.
[02:42:49.598 --> 02:42:50.998]  We travel the world, by the way.
[02:42:51.499 --> 02:42:56.520]  So when I talk about what's going on in Israel, we go to the Jerusalem Post, Ahanet's, Times of Israel.
[02:42:57.310 --> 02:43:01.232]  We go to the Iranian newspapers, ISNA, IRNA, Tehran News.
[02:43:01.772 --> 02:43:02.872]  We go to Al Jazeera.
[02:43:02.892 --> 02:43:03.973]  We follow the news.
[02:43:04.353 --> 02:43:05.793]  We want to see what everybody's saying.
[02:43:05.873 --> 02:43:07.874]  So, InfoWars is one of them.
[02:43:08.334 --> 02:43:24.641]  And going back to what the speakers, you know, some of the people we're just on now talking about, about the importance of InfoWars, what they're putting out and what we put out in the Trends Journal, giving you information when we're being silenced.
[02:43:25.618 --> 02:43:30.100]  So at Davos, the Davos gang, what a freak show, what a freak show.
[02:43:30.841 --> 02:43:35.163]  Oh, and by the way, one of the earlier callers, a woman, talked about Congress.
[02:43:37.424 --> 02:43:43.667]  C-O-N-G, Con-R, yeah, A-S-S.
[02:43:46.909 --> 02:43:47.909]  Congress.
[02:43:50.310 --> 02:43:51.171]  Yeah, A-S-S.
[02:43:52.817 --> 02:43:57.601]  Look at the little stupid freaks telling the people what to do.
[02:43:57.981 --> 02:43:59.602]  Oh yeah, before we're talking about fighting.
[02:43:59.942 --> 02:44:02.805]  Yeah, I'm a warrior for the Prince of Peace.
[02:44:03.925 --> 02:44:05.386]  I want everything peaceful.
[02:44:06.107 --> 02:44:07.128]  I'm like Alex.
[02:44:09.489 --> 02:44:10.430]  Attack the attacker.
[02:44:11.731 --> 02:44:12.792]  Only time you get in a fight.
[02:44:13.532 --> 02:44:16.555]  And, you know, I taught close combat for a number of years.
[02:44:16.575 --> 02:44:18.136]  You know, I'm a real fighter.
[02:44:18.792 --> 02:44:27.157]  Napolitano, born in the Bronx, born to be free, 1946 at the height of American spirit, right after World War II.
[02:44:27.778 --> 02:44:29.579]  Everybody, boy, it was great.
[02:44:29.739 --> 02:44:31.620]  And now it's a freak show.
[02:44:31.660 --> 02:44:38.044]  So going back to the fight, Congress, we're in charge.
[02:44:39.225 --> 02:44:40.986]  The people better get that in their head.
[02:44:41.929 --> 02:44:47.973]  All these little clown boys and clown girls are nothing more than public servants.
[02:44:48.534 --> 02:44:48.874]  Got it?
[02:44:50.075 --> 02:44:50.415]  Got it?
[02:44:52.556 --> 02:44:59.061]  How can you be so stupid to swallow the crap spewing out of their mounds?
[02:44:59.821 --> 02:45:01.563]  How dumb can you be?
[02:45:03.064 --> 02:45:04.304]  Oh, I'm a repulsive kid.
[02:45:04.725 --> 02:45:05.725]  I'm a democrat.
[02:45:06.566 --> 02:45:07.507]  Get out of your mind.
[02:45:07.567 --> 02:45:08.908]  It's a crime syndicate.
[02:45:09.628 --> 02:45:10.889]  By their deeds, you shall know them.
[02:45:11.747 --> 02:45:24.892]  So, going back to InfoWars, going back to Davos, they had this new woman on there that just became the chief over there, editor-in-chief of the Wall Street Journal.
[02:45:26.273 --> 02:45:40.619]  I take out the word Wall Street and I put in another word that begins with an S and an H. This is a, they brought her over from the UK, which you could put an F and a C in that too.
[02:45:41.758 --> 02:45:42.939]  Cuz that's all it is.
[02:45:44.440 --> 02:45:47.523]  She's quoted as saying, not the exact language.
[02:45:49.644 --> 02:45:52.587]  And this wasn't an InfoWars, but I'm gonna get to the InfoWars article.
[02:45:53.808 --> 02:45:58.471]  That we're going to publish what the people want to hear.
[02:45:58.491 --> 02:46:04.336]  Hey, I spent five hours a day for this thing.
[02:46:06.157 --> 02:46:08.819]  Five hours a day, no, not what I want to hear.
[02:46:09.915 --> 02:46:10.956]  Could you get this in your head?
[02:46:11.556 --> 02:46:13.478]  I'm looking for financial data.
[02:46:14.659 --> 02:46:14.999]  That's it.
[02:46:15.539 --> 02:46:16.720]  Wall Street Journal?
[02:46:16.780 --> 02:46:17.461]  Wall Street?
[02:46:17.941 --> 02:46:18.141]  Yeah.
[02:46:20.803 --> 02:46:23.145]  The street, the gang, the White Shoe Boys?
[02:46:23.385 --> 02:46:23.585]  Yeah.
[02:46:23.785 --> 02:46:24.966]  I want to know what's going on.
[02:46:25.547 --> 02:46:33.552]  I want all the data, all the data I can get on financial, you know, what's going on in nations.
[02:46:34.513 --> 02:46:35.654]  I want to know all about this.
[02:46:36.094 --> 02:46:36.315]  No.
[02:46:36.935 --> 02:46:38.176]  We're going to give you what you want.
[02:46:39.696 --> 02:46:46.738]  So, again, you go to jonestrends.com and you get a break on the Trends Journal.
[02:46:46.938 --> 02:46:48.698]  This is $5 a day.
[02:46:48.718 --> 02:46:52.659]  The Trends Journal is going to cost you about $2.50 a week.
[02:46:53.359 --> 02:46:56.760]  And you're getting what you're not getting anywhere else in the world, not even close.
[02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:58.101]  If you could show me, let me know.
[02:46:58.461 --> 02:47:02.902]  So going back to the clown lady running the show now, I'm the editor-in-chief.
[02:47:03.302 --> 02:47:04.922]  You do what I say.
[02:47:04.942 --> 02:47:06.963]  They brought me in from the UK.
[02:47:09.420 --> 02:47:09.700]  Ready?
[02:47:11.341 --> 02:47:17.424]  This is the front page of Saturday's Wall Street Journal.
[02:47:20.145 --> 02:47:22.787]  Orthodox Christians take plunge of faith.
[02:47:23.627 --> 02:47:24.747]  Baptism of ice.
[02:47:25.648 --> 02:47:33.332]  A man takes a dip in frigid water, symbolizing the baptism of Christ during the Orthodox Christian feast.
[02:47:34.572 --> 02:47:35.773]  What the hell do I want to hear about this?
[02:47:37.154 --> 02:47:38.054]  What do I want to hear about this?
[02:47:41.237 --> 02:47:42.857]  Go to this Wall Street Journal.
[02:47:42.877 --> 02:47:43.277]  Oh, I was wrong.
[02:47:43.096 --> 02:47:50.096]  Last Stitch Hope.
[02:47:49.018 --> 02:47:49.518]  Nothing.
[02:47:49.518 --> 02:47:57.978]  Go to this Wall Street Journal.
[02:47:57.978 --> 02:48:00.138]  Oh, I was wrong.
[02:48:00.138 --> 02:48:04.777]  Saturday's paper $6.
[02:48:04.777 --> 02:48:10.857]  $6 I didn't get one article from here that was trend worthy.
[02:48:10.857 --> 02:48:14.458]  They do a report.
[02:48:14.458 --> 02:48:17.578]  And what the markets did.
[02:48:17.578 --> 02:48:27.578]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:48:19.302 --> 02:48:19.482]  Right?
[02:48:24.225 --> 02:48:26.686]  Not one word, not one word.
[02:48:27.026 --> 02:48:28.706]  What did the markets do over in the EU?
[02:48:28.726 --> 02:48:30.407]  F you, what EU?
[02:48:30.427 --> 02:48:33.468]  What did they do over in Asia?
[02:48:33.508 --> 02:48:34.189]  What's Asia?
[02:48:36.150 --> 02:48:36.430]  Nothing.
[02:48:37.170 --> 02:48:37.430]  Nothing.
[02:48:38.551 --> 02:48:41.552]  So going back to the article, because all things are connected.
[02:48:42.315 --> 02:48:43.836]  Like the blood which unites us all said.
[02:48:45.358 --> 02:48:52.844]  Chief Seattle, in Infowars, this arrogant lady, we owned the media!
[02:48:54.606 --> 02:49:00.171]  Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief laments death to public trust in mainstream media.
[02:49:00.191 --> 02:49:05.035]  If you go back not too long ago, we own the media!
[02:49:05.916 --> 02:49:07.678]  We are the gatekeepers!
[02:49:12.571 --> 02:49:12.791]  Yep.
[02:49:15.792 --> 02:49:18.833]  And we much owned the facts as well.
[02:49:18.853 --> 02:49:21.213]  Hey, fack you!
[02:49:22.854 --> 02:49:24.054]  Fack you!
[02:49:25.234 --> 02:49:27.355]  What facts you talking about?
[02:49:28.875 --> 02:49:32.557]  The crap that you make up that the gang sends you?
[02:49:33.777 --> 02:49:35.297]  We own the media.
[02:49:35.857 --> 02:49:37.578]  We'll tell you what to do.
[02:49:38.812 --> 02:49:40.893]  You're just a piece of crap!
[02:49:42.113 --> 02:49:42.493]  Hey!
[02:49:43.213 --> 02:49:45.854]  I'm the editor-in-chief, and how much money I make!
[02:49:45.874 --> 02:49:45.914]  No.
[02:49:47.215 --> 02:49:49.035]  You know who you are?
[02:49:49.655 --> 02:49:51.796]  You're a bunch of prostitutes.
[02:49:52.676 --> 02:50:00.178]  You're media whores that get paid to put out by the corporate pimps and your government whoremasters.
[02:50:00.759 --> 02:50:06.160]  Oh, and by the way, I was corrected for using the title prostitutes.
[02:50:07.421 --> 02:50:10.155]   A contributor to Occupy Peace.
[02:50:10.676 --> 02:50:13.537]  And again, I'm a warrior for the Prince of Peace, so I launched Occupy Peace.
[02:50:15.698 --> 02:50:22.302]  She wrote me from Oklahoma, a very generous donation, that I misused the title, Prestitute.
[02:50:24.203 --> 02:50:28.926]  Because a prostitute, you pay them money and you get something back.
[02:50:32.047 --> 02:50:33.768]  You get nothing from prostitutes.
[02:50:33.828 --> 02:50:35.989]  The arrogance, the arrogance!
[02:50:37.229 --> 02:50:45.469]  But you make it clear, we are the gatekeepers.
[02:50:45.857 --> 02:50:46.757]  Oh yeah!
[02:50:47.298 --> 02:50:51.379]  You're the slime balls that lied us into the Iraq War.
[02:50:52.160 --> 02:50:54.641]  You sold the crap of the Afghan War.
[02:50:55.221 --> 02:50:57.302]  Oh, I grew up during the Vietnam War.
[02:50:58.063 --> 02:50:59.123]  Gatekeepers?
[02:51:00.164 --> 02:51:01.244]  Prostitutes!
[02:51:01.964 --> 02:51:05.166]  You open the gate to bend over, you got it?
[02:51:09.168 --> 02:51:11.269]  Again, that's why you read InfoWars.
[02:51:11.369 --> 02:51:14.772]   So, This keeps getting worse.
[02:51:15.933 --> 02:51:21.834]  You got that Ursula von der Leyen, her speech at Davos.
[02:51:24.595 --> 02:51:25.676]  The number one threat.
[02:51:27.616 --> 02:51:28.777]  The number one threat.
[02:51:29.477 --> 02:51:31.057]  Yeah, von der Leyen.
[02:51:31.157 --> 02:51:33.298]  Von der Leyen, piece of crap.
[02:51:33.718 --> 02:51:36.399]  A little warmongering lady, by the way.
[02:51:36.879 --> 02:51:38.340]  Oh, yeah, that's right.
[02:51:39.540 --> 02:51:42.761]  You still got that German Nazi blood in you, don't you, huh?
[02:51:44.261 --> 02:51:45.301]  Loves the wars!
[02:51:45.501 --> 02:51:46.322]  Loves the wars!
[02:51:46.542 --> 02:51:47.522]  Oh, a war whore.
[02:51:47.882 --> 02:52:04.066]  Oh, and by the way, anybody that supports the wars, get in your military drag, go fight, send your wife, your kids, your money, yourself, or shut your mouths.
[02:52:04.206 --> 02:52:06.927]  Oh, and your transgenders, make sure you take them too.
[02:52:07.547 --> 02:52:09.188]  There's Van the Lion.
[02:52:10.348 --> 02:52:13.549]  The greatest threat is misinformation.
[02:52:15.742 --> 02:52:15.902]  Yep.
[02:52:19.324 --> 02:52:39.995]  And she goes on to say, very challenging times, but also ensuring its strong and influential voice in global affairs, saying how great, great, great, the World Economic Forum, their strong and influential voice in global affairs.
[02:52:41.376 --> 02:52:41.496]  Yep.
[02:52:43.510 --> 02:52:49.831]  Your leadership is a beacon of inspiration, symbolizing unity's strength.
[02:52:49.851 --> 02:52:51.271]  Yep.
[02:52:53.412 --> 02:52:54.512]  Oh, this is the introduction.
[02:52:54.832 --> 02:52:55.692]  That was the introduction.
[02:52:56.152 --> 02:52:57.872]  President Ursula von Angers.
[02:52:57.892 --> 02:52:58.273]  Yep.
[02:52:58.493 --> 02:52:58.993]  Excellency.
[02:52:59.313 --> 02:53:01.073]  She begins it by saying, you ready?
[02:53:01.533 --> 02:53:02.033]  Ready for this?
[02:53:03.013 --> 02:53:09.154]  Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, and dear Klaus Slaab.
[02:53:11.375 --> 02:53:21.950]   Excellencies, Excellencies, don't forget to bow down to the excellencies, his majesty.
[02:53:24.391 --> 02:53:27.573]  Excellencies, who the hell are you talking to?
[02:53:28.813 --> 02:53:31.474]  Oh, excellencies don't pee or poo.
[02:53:33.095 --> 02:53:34.995]  They're just a little giddy from the Bronx.
[02:53:37.536 --> 02:53:41.438]  Excellencies, that's how much better they are.
[02:53:42.139 --> 02:53:43.920]  And they own everything.
[02:53:44.421 --> 02:53:47.182]  So again, sobering reality.
[02:53:48.663 --> 02:53:49.904]  The risks are serious.
[02:53:51.705 --> 02:53:57.049]  Because they limit our ability to tackle the big global challenges we are facing.
[02:53:58.450 --> 02:54:00.211]  For the global business community!
[02:54:01.215 --> 02:54:07.580]  For the global business community, the global leaders own everything!
[02:54:08.120 --> 02:54:10.682]  You are not allowed to own anything!
[02:54:11.162 --> 02:54:13.844]  It is only the global community!
[02:54:14.725 --> 02:54:16.126]  I'm Vonda Lyon!
[02:54:18.848 --> 02:54:27.254]  For the global business community, the top concern for the next two years is not conflict.
[02:54:27.554 --> 02:54:28.515]  Oh no, not wars.
[02:54:28.615 --> 02:54:29.476]  Conflict.
[02:54:34.338 --> 02:54:38.919]  Or climate, it is disinformation and misinformation.
[02:54:40.540 --> 02:54:40.740]  Yep.
[02:54:41.840 --> 02:54:50.082]  In other words, you are only allowed to swallow the crap spewing out of our mouths.
[02:54:51.683 --> 02:54:52.303]  Who you talking?
[02:54:54.103 --> 02:54:54.704]  Oh, yeah.
[02:54:57.404 --> 02:54:58.525]  Put on that mask.
[02:54:59.245 --> 02:55:01.005]  Stand succeed upon.
[02:55:01.785 --> 02:55:02.746]  Oh, the jab 60%.
[02:55:04.639 --> 02:55:06.260]  96% efficacy rate.
[02:55:08.721 --> 02:55:12.163]  You have no idea the number of people I know that have COVID again.
[02:55:14.044 --> 02:55:15.025]  All jabbed up.
[02:55:15.225 --> 02:55:16.265]  Never got COVID.
[02:55:16.706 --> 02:55:20.708]  Haven't been sick in going on five years.
[02:55:21.228 --> 02:55:23.529]  Because I take vitamins and supplements every day.
[02:55:25.090 --> 02:55:26.070]  Try to stay in good health.
[02:55:27.731 --> 02:55:29.132]  But this is the crap going on.
[02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:31.701]  And again, that's why you go to InfoWars.
[02:55:31.741 --> 02:55:32.761]  They wrote this article.
[02:55:33.401 --> 02:55:33.982]  I looked it up.
[02:55:34.462 --> 02:55:38.283]  And when you read her whole thing, it is just so disgusting.
[02:55:38.323 --> 02:55:41.045]  They make it very clear of who's in charge.
[02:55:41.885 --> 02:55:56.271]  And the facts are also there as to who's in charge because you have the 1% according to Oxfam. 1%.
[02:56:00.214 --> 02:56:05.638]  Owns 43% of the global financial assets.
[02:56:06.999 --> 02:56:07.639]  That's right.
[02:56:09.120 --> 02:56:13.924]  We're nothing more than plantation workers of Slavelandia.
[02:56:15.184 --> 02:56:19.568]  And Davos, they're the plantation leaders, man.
[02:56:19.588 --> 02:56:19.648]  Yep.
[02:56:20.447 --> 02:56:20.947]  Yep.
[02:56:20.947 --> 02:56:24.387]  Yep.
[02:56:24.387 --> 02:56:31.327]  She makes it very, very, very clear.
[02:56:31.327 --> 02:56:41.326]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:56:35.666 --> 02:56:38.227]  For the global business community!
[02:56:38.307 --> 02:56:42.969]  Hey, how about nationalization, huh?
[02:56:44.749 --> 02:56:49.191]  The only way America is going to come back is to become a self-sufficient economy.
[02:56:50.672 --> 02:56:58.906]   We have all the human and natural resources we can use, with the exception of very few, To be self-sustaining.
[02:57:00.847 --> 02:57:05.669]  We don't have to import products from other slave labor countries.
[02:57:06.349 --> 02:57:08.531]  And they did this so they wouldn't have to pay people.
[02:57:09.031 --> 02:57:21.117]  And by the way, when I was on with Alex Jones talking about the migration issue, I said what no one's talking about is the refugee issue.
[02:57:21.177 --> 02:57:26.600]  People are escaping lack of basic living standards, crime, government corruption, violence.
[02:57:27.748 --> 02:57:32.452]  I said, what no one's talking about is they're bringing in cheap labor.
[02:57:33.553 --> 02:57:37.075]  And that's what the global community needs.
[02:57:37.996 --> 02:57:43.740]  Just go to Marshall's or CVS or any store and see.
[02:57:44.761 --> 02:57:45.442]  We need help.
[02:57:46.082 --> 02:57:47.203]  We need cheap labor.
[02:57:47.763 --> 02:57:49.585]  That's why they're letting them come in, I said.
[02:57:50.506 --> 02:58:03.198]   Now, remember, I was back Now, Financial Times, January 20th.
[02:58:04.879 --> 02:58:12.807]  German eases citizenship law to fill skills gap.
[02:58:15.650 --> 02:58:30.243]   German parliament passed a law that will make it easy for foreigners to acquire citizenship as Berlin looks to immigration To solve a dire shortage of skilled workers.
[02:58:30.403 --> 02:58:30.944]  Oh, yeah.
[02:58:31.404 --> 02:58:33.726]  Oh, they're so... You know, you dumb people.
[02:58:33.786 --> 02:58:34.867]  What are you, the Germans?
[02:58:36.268 --> 02:58:44.073]  The Germans are one of the most advanced societies scientifically, culturally, philosophically in the world.
[02:58:45.114 --> 02:58:46.855]  You gotta bring in slave labor?
[02:58:48.417 --> 02:58:50.598]  That's all they're doing it for.
[02:58:52.600 --> 02:58:52.940]  Got it?
[02:58:54.215 --> 02:59:05.178]  And again, that woman that called up, talked about Congress, C-O-N-G-R-A-S-S.
[02:59:09.959 --> 02:59:12.300]  Dumb little clowns telling us what to do.
[02:59:12.340 --> 02:59:20.542]  So we're going to come back, we're going to talk about the economy, what's next, where it's going, and remember, support InfoWars, they're supporting you.
[02:59:21.118 --> 02:59:29.346]  Cellular damage from a type of free radical known as reactive oxygen species can cause decreased cellular function.
[02:59:29.667 --> 02:59:36.494]  DNA Force Plus contains what are believed to be the most beneficial ingredients to remedy this.

[03:02:11.725 --> 03:02:12.786]  Don't like my language.
[03:02:13.526 --> 03:02:16.553]   You know, somebody Somebody's trying to take you down, man.
[03:02:16.594 --> 03:02:17.835]  You'll say, please don't hit me.
[03:02:17.915 --> 03:02:19.056]  I'll be a good little boy.
[03:02:19.076 --> 03:02:20.417]  I'll be nice.
[03:02:20.437 --> 03:02:22.479]  It came out this article.
[03:02:24.581 --> 03:02:26.802]  Swearing has become more acceptable.
[03:02:27.243 --> 03:02:27.683]  Expert.
[03:02:28.724 --> 03:02:34.749]  The use of swear words has become more widely acceptable in modern British society in recent years.
[03:02:36.091 --> 03:02:41.916]  Due to people finding alternative definitions for language previously considered distasteful.
[03:02:43.081 --> 03:02:46.303]  A linguistic expert says, linguistic expert.
[03:02:46.804 --> 03:02:48.125]  Hey, got some!
[03:02:48.785 --> 03:02:51.107]  The people are angry, you got it?
[03:02:51.807 --> 03:02:55.550]  It's appropriate language in an appropriate situation.
[03:02:56.030 --> 03:02:58.211]  Oh, hey, linguistic expert.
[03:02:58.652 --> 03:02:59.672]  Maybe you forgot.
[03:03:00.273 --> 03:03:09.999]  Maybe you forgot the little clown boy that one of the finest cartoonists in the world couldn't up with a freakier little figure than Boris Johnson.
[03:03:10.520 --> 03:03:10.980]  Yee!
[03:03:12.001 --> 03:03:12.141]  Eh!
[03:03:12.824 --> 03:03:21.207]  Yeah, Boar, again, B-O-A-R, space, A-S-S, Boar S. Johnson.
[03:03:21.767 --> 03:03:21.967]  Yeah.
[03:03:22.808 --> 03:03:33.552]  The guy that gave you the COVID war, that destroyed your economy, as he's partying, and the cat don't know how to party, man, all day, you know what I mean?
[03:03:35.001 --> 03:03:37.763]  Okay, I'm so sad when I look at the world.
[03:03:38.384 --> 03:03:40.746]  Not a drop of boogie, not an ounce of jives.
[03:03:40.766 --> 03:03:42.627]  That cat, he wasn't partying.
[03:03:42.687 --> 03:03:44.469]  Oh, just like that other arrogant little boy.
[03:03:44.489 --> 03:03:47.972]  My daddy was the lawyer for the Getty Gang.
[03:03:48.392 --> 03:03:55.038]  Look at Gavin Newsom, closing down everything while he's partying at the French Laundry at about $400 a plate.
[03:03:55.978 --> 03:04:07.248]   So going back to what's going on, and why they're using this kind of language in the UK, Because I said you've got to put an F and a C in there, in the UK.
[03:04:07.268 --> 03:04:10.010]  Because that's what they did to the people.
[03:04:11.031 --> 03:04:12.032]  And the people are angry.
[03:04:13.112 --> 03:04:14.674]  And it goes back to the callers.
[03:04:15.875 --> 03:04:16.795]  The people are fed up.
[03:04:18.897 --> 03:04:20.638]  Again, they don't want Trump or Biden.
[03:04:23.120 --> 03:04:25.002]  You get your Trends Journal, you got more information.
[03:04:25.062 --> 03:04:27.444]  Again, go to Jones Trends, you get a good deal.
[03:04:28.625 --> 03:04:30.206]  Again, I supported Trump.
[03:04:30.706 --> 03:04:32.448]  And I don't support him anymore.
[03:04:33.636 --> 03:04:39.758]  And by the way, I also believe 100% that he won the election in 2020.
[03:04:41.679 --> 03:04:49.842]  I was doing the whole election broadcast on with Greg Hunter on Watchdog USA.
[03:04:51.822 --> 03:04:53.603]  And I'm looking at the numbers are coming in.
[03:04:53.643 --> 03:04:54.623]  He had all the data.
[03:04:54.643 --> 03:04:55.784]  He had all these screens up.
[03:04:55.824 --> 03:04:57.344]  It was really top, top he did.
[03:04:58.264 --> 03:05:00.665]  And it's Trump and Biden under him.
[03:05:00.685 --> 03:05:02.906]  It's going like this every all over, all over.
[03:05:03.775 --> 03:05:12.760]  All of a sudden, like 120,000 mail-in ballots came in.
[03:05:12.840 --> 03:05:16.482]  And Biden got all of them, like from Wisconsin or Michigan or someplace.
[03:05:16.842 --> 03:05:18.302]  It happened like in a couple of states.
[03:05:19.203 --> 03:05:19.823]  Are you kidding me?
[03:05:19.863 --> 03:05:20.824]  What am I, six years old?
[03:05:20.864 --> 03:05:22.665]  You mean out of 120, I didn't get one?
[03:05:24.566 --> 03:05:27.107]  And it was Trump that made up the mail-in ballot thing to happen.
[03:05:28.308 --> 03:05:31.229]  Who also gave us Operation Warp Speed Vax.
[03:05:33.892 --> 03:05:53.241]  And on March 13th, Black Friday, March 2020, he launched a state of emergency, declared a state of emergency to fight the COVID war.
[03:05:53.261 --> 03:05:55.682]  So anyway, I got a lot of reasons I don't think they can.
[03:05:56.562 --> 03:06:01.004]  Going back, the people, when you look at the polls, they want to change.
[03:06:02.847 --> 03:06:04.347]  We need a new third party.
[03:06:06.688 --> 03:06:09.488]  We need a Ron Paul type.
[03:06:10.369 --> 03:06:12.029]  Not Rand Paul, but Ron, the father.
[03:06:15.190 --> 03:06:16.310]  So the time is right.
[03:06:16.330 --> 03:06:18.990]  The people are fed up and that's why they're changing their language.
[03:06:20.251 --> 03:06:22.211]  It's situational language.
[03:06:22.631 --> 03:06:24.231]  It's the proper language.
[03:06:24.551 --> 03:06:25.672]  It's not swearing.
[03:06:25.712 --> 03:06:26.932]  What are you, kindergarten?
[03:06:28.412 --> 03:06:29.773]  That's a swear word.
[03:06:29.793 --> 03:06:32.053]  How do you know it's a swear word?
[03:06:32.910 --> 03:06:35.491]  Well, it's in Chapter 3, Section 8.
[03:06:35.571 --> 03:06:36.451]  It's a good book.
[03:06:40.313 --> 03:06:41.533]  They're not swear words.
[03:06:41.593 --> 03:06:42.834]  They're proper words.
[03:06:44.375 --> 03:06:45.895]  But you can't say them.
[03:06:45.915 --> 03:06:58.600]  So, Ron Paul has an article they have up on Infowars that has to do with the economy.
[03:06:59.281 --> 03:07:01.301]  Going back to the economy, the markets are up.
[03:07:05.473 --> 03:07:14.240]  Gold's down, hanging around the four, uh, the, uh, down about seven bucks, 220 range, 2020.
[03:07:15.461 --> 03:07:17.182]  And Bitcoin's hanging in the 40,000 range.
[03:07:17.202 --> 03:07:21.785]  I would have thought it would have gone up after they had that ETF thing, but it hasn't.
[03:07:22.366 --> 03:07:23.487]  And I'm still bullish on it.
[03:07:24.447 --> 03:07:26.529]  I don't, you know, it could go down another $10,000.
[03:07:26.569 --> 03:07:31.432]  It's still way up from where it began, starting at zero about 12 years ago.
[03:07:33.074 --> 03:07:34.715]  And I'm very bullish on gold.
[03:07:35.478 --> 03:07:37.099]  And again, we don't give financial advice.
[03:07:37.119 --> 03:07:43.022]  I'm just telling you what we see is trend forecasters, because they're going to be lowering interest rates in March.
[03:07:43.883 --> 03:07:45.804]  They'll run up to the Presidential Reality Show.
[03:07:45.824 --> 03:07:55.329]  They're going to do everything they can to keep the power in power in power, because you got Janet Yellen, the such a brute, who's our Treasury Secretary, the former head of the Federal Reserve.
[03:07:55.349 --> 03:07:57.650]  So you got the gang, they want to keep the gang.
[03:07:57.791 --> 03:08:07.437]   Could you imagine the Federal Reserve head is running I will charge you the part.
[03:08:08.538 --> 03:08:11.380]  How stupid can you be not to see who's running the gang in charge?
[03:08:11.880 --> 03:08:16.664]  So going back to Ron Paul's article, he says, don't tax the rich and the Fed.
[03:08:17.925 --> 03:08:26.813]  Select politician, he goes on, they say raise their things, but he said the Federal Reserve is causing, is the cause of the inequality.
[03:08:27.774 --> 03:08:35.440]  First of all, I think, you know, if they're going to have taxes, I'd go back to the Eisenhower days where these cats would be paying 90% and most of them pay nothing.
[03:08:36.832 --> 03:08:38.433]  And by the way, that's the other thing that Trump did.
[03:08:38.453 --> 03:08:39.795]  He lowered the taxes for these.
[03:08:40.255 --> 03:08:47.361]  And after he lowered the taxes for the corporations back in 2017, they had the biggest year of stock buybacks.
[03:08:48.101 --> 03:08:51.044]  Because he said, oh, they couldn't build capital improvements.
[03:08:51.584 --> 03:08:52.945]  Nothing for capital improvements.
[03:08:52.965 --> 03:08:54.507]  They all went to stock buybacks.
[03:08:54.807 --> 03:08:55.948]  Had a record year of stock buybacks.
[03:08:57.009 --> 03:08:58.610]  So going back to the Fed.
[03:09:00.472 --> 03:09:05.776]  The guy that gave us the Federal Reserve, may he rot in hell, is Woodrow Wilson.
[03:09:08.027 --> 03:09:11.548]  He created the Federal Reserve, then he gave us Federal Income Taxes.
[03:09:13.668 --> 03:09:20.589]  He also gave us World War I. Gonna spread democracy across the globe, and they still repeat that crap.
[03:09:20.729 --> 03:09:21.809]  I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy.
[03:09:21.829 --> 03:09:23.610]  I'm gonna go die for something.
[03:09:24.510 --> 03:09:28.010]  He assassinated this Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo.
[03:09:28.050 --> 03:09:28.811]  Let's go fight!
[03:09:29.411 --> 03:09:29.691]  Alright?
[03:09:30.211 --> 03:09:30.731]  Oh, oh.
[03:09:31.171 --> 03:09:35.452]  Oh, that clown lady about the, uh, the War Crap Journal?
[03:09:35.652 --> 03:09:36.652]  I can't say the S-word?
[03:09:37.560 --> 03:09:40.141]  We said that, um, we're the gatekeepers?
[03:09:40.462 --> 03:09:41.963]  Oh yeah, you sold us those wars too.
[03:09:43.243 --> 03:09:44.784]  Oh, the Hearst Corporation, I forgot.
[03:09:46.905 --> 03:09:48.266]  So going back to the taxes.
[03:09:52.148 --> 03:10:01.313]  Paul Craig Roberts, you go to paulcraigroberts.org, has an article about this.
[03:10:02.354 --> 03:10:08.771]   Americans enslave themselves to the state When they accepted the income tax.
[03:10:11.453 --> 03:10:21.799]  It was not until 1913, 137 years after the Declaration of Independence established a free people, who are no longer free, that there was an income tax.
[03:10:25.381 --> 03:10:25.601]  Yep.
[03:10:29.623 --> 03:10:32.605]  The income tax required a constitutional amendment.
[03:10:33.045 --> 03:10:34.306]  I remember some of the story.
[03:10:34.786 --> 03:10:35.687]  What I remember is this.
[03:10:36.710 --> 03:10:40.333]  The threshold for being subjected to income tax was high.
[03:10:41.214 --> 03:10:42.154]  And the first rate was 1%.
[03:10:42.194 --> 03:10:45.577]  So in other words, you really had to be rich.
[03:10:46.678 --> 03:10:58.067]  The Georgia legislator voted to ratify the amendment because as one legislative leader declared, quote, there's no one in Georgia with an income high enough to be subject to the tax.
[03:10:59.008 --> 03:11:00.929]  Let the Yankees tax themselves.
[03:11:00.989 --> 03:11:01.750]  Why should we object?
[03:11:02.971 --> 03:11:04.212]  There's no vision of the future.
[03:11:06.445 --> 03:11:19.012]  1913 was also the year that the Federal Reserve, with its policy of depression, inflation, recession, and inflation, was established and unleashed on America.
[03:11:22.194 --> 03:11:32.621]  And that was also the year World War I and its inflation was about to be launched by the French, Russians, and British governments.
[03:11:33.528 --> 03:11:40.528]   War and inflation quickly brought the income tax to Americans who thought they were exempt.
[03:11:40.528 --> 03:11:49.528]  Ron Paul is 100% correct.
[03:11:50.059 --> 03:11:53.961]  You're aware of the federal income tax.
[03:11:56.123 --> 03:11:58.945]  We got a bunch of clowns that have all these bureaucratic jobs.
[03:11:59.225 --> 03:12:00.726]  Actually, they spell that wrong.
[03:12:01.006 --> 03:12:02.627]  They're bureau-craps.
[03:12:03.729 --> 03:12:12.212]  Little boys and girls who can't get a job in the real world, that suck into the political system, bow down so they can get their way up to the top.
[03:12:12.632 --> 03:12:15.293]  And they become the most arrogant.
[03:12:15.794 --> 03:12:17.114]  The most arrogant.
[03:12:18.735 --> 03:12:20.916]  We don't need the federal government to tell us what to do.
[03:12:22.036 --> 03:12:23.376]  I believe in states' rights.
[03:12:25.277 --> 03:12:25.997]  Pro-abortion.
[03:12:27.658 --> 03:12:28.478]  Anti-abortion.
[03:12:29.419 --> 03:12:30.079]  Choose your state.
[03:12:33.951 --> 03:12:34.631]  Gun laws?
[03:12:36.553 --> 03:12:37.293]  No gun laws?
[03:12:39.395 --> 03:12:39.555]  No.
[03:12:40.195 --> 03:12:41.416]  Can't choose your state on that one.
[03:12:42.016 --> 03:12:43.177]  Because that's the Second Amendment.
[03:12:45.939 --> 03:12:47.900]  So you pick and choose where you want to go.
[03:12:50.482 --> 03:12:51.623]  I believe in states' rights.
[03:12:53.564 --> 03:13:00.528]  Before The War Criminal, I did a podcast with Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[03:13:00.588 --> 03:13:01.669]  I do one every Wednesday.
[03:13:01.689 --> 03:13:02.730]  You go to Gerald Cilenti.
[03:13:03.670 --> 03:13:10.114]  And he was talking about when Nikki Haley came out and said that it was not only slavery about Lincoln and they attacked her.
[03:13:10.894 --> 03:13:18.639]  And he said, of course, he's no supporter of Nikki Haley, who's nothing more than Lindsey Grahame in high heels, using his term.
[03:13:19.739 --> 03:13:23.281]  But the Civil War wasn't about slavery.
[03:13:24.502 --> 03:13:31.686]  It was about more government control, unionization, and he went on to say that the Emancipation Proclamation did not free the slaves.
[03:13:33.854 --> 03:13:40.619]  Freedom of slavery wasn't enacted in law until eight months after Lincoln died.
[03:13:43.161 --> 03:13:47.064]  So this whole tax thing is just to build a federal government.
[03:13:48.165 --> 03:13:49.846]  And we don't need the feds in charge.
[03:13:50.846 --> 03:13:52.007]  We the people are in charge.
[03:13:53.368 --> 03:13:54.729]  We have to unite to do that.
[03:13:54.909 --> 03:13:59.653]  Right now there's no politician that I support that's speaking about that.
[03:14:01.089 --> 03:14:02.810]  But there's no need for this federal income.
[03:14:03.131 --> 03:14:05.292]  I don't want to tell you how much federal income tax I pay.
[03:14:05.813 --> 03:14:07.514]  Oh, then I pay all these school taxes.
[03:14:07.574 --> 03:14:08.435]  I never had any kids.
[03:14:10.776 --> 03:14:12.097]  My mother may she rest in peace.
[03:14:12.137 --> 03:14:13.338]  I was the youngest of five.
[03:14:13.498 --> 03:14:14.539]  Again, born in 1946.
[03:14:15.680 --> 03:14:15.920]  Phew!
[03:14:16.801 --> 03:14:17.642]  Free as could be.
[03:14:18.282 --> 03:14:20.123]  One time she's chasing me around the house.
[03:14:21.024 --> 03:14:22.085]  And she finally caught me.
[03:14:22.125 --> 03:14:23.506]  Italian women never hit their kids.
[03:14:23.906 --> 03:14:24.687]  Used to bite their hand.
[03:14:26.850 --> 03:14:30.853]  In Italian, she said to me, I can't repeat what that means.
[03:14:31.373 --> 03:14:32.294]  You're better off dead.
[03:14:32.594 --> 03:14:34.055]  You should have three worse than you.
[03:14:34.075 --> 03:14:35.836]  I couldn't imagine one like me.
[03:14:36.216 --> 03:14:40.679]  I ran away from kindergarten at four and a half years old and crossed the Boston Post Road in the Bronx.
[03:14:41.300 --> 03:14:45.423]  She used to tell me they used to tie me to the crib with nylon stockings because I'm out the window.
[03:14:46.043 --> 03:14:46.263]  Yeah.
[03:14:46.844 --> 03:14:49.705]  Again, now they have them arrested for tying me to the crib.
[03:14:50.466 --> 03:14:51.627]  I'm better off dead.
[03:14:51.647 --> 03:14:53.588]  Let them climb out the window.
[03:14:54.489 --> 03:14:59.986]   So anyway, I was talking about talking about federal income tax, talking about freedom.
[03:15:00.466 --> 03:15:07.767]  And how was I talking about talking about federal income tax?
[03:15:08.267 --> 03:15:10.467]  I forgot.
[03:15:15.088 --> 03:15:15.828]  Lost our freedom.
[03:15:16.728 --> 03:15:17.149]  It's gone.
[03:15:18.029 --> 03:15:25.770]  And as I said, I'm a lucky guy because where I was born and when I was born, but going back to the rich getting richer.
[03:15:26.758 --> 03:15:31.982]  The time I grew up, there were drugstores, stationary stores, hardware stores.
[03:15:33.503 --> 03:15:35.485]  Now, the bigs own everything.
[03:15:36.446 --> 03:15:38.888]  So, no federal taxes.
[03:15:42.090 --> 03:15:42.791]  States' rights.
[03:15:45.353 --> 03:15:47.715]  And going back to the economy, where is it going to go?
[03:15:47.735 --> 03:15:50.557]  They're going to lower interest rates, as I said.
[03:15:50.597 --> 03:15:53.239]  When interest rates go down, the dollar goes down.
[03:15:54.372 --> 03:15:56.773]  And again, that's the cover of your magazine this week.
[03:15:57.434 --> 03:15:58.294]  Dollar sinking.
[03:16:00.555 --> 03:16:01.856]  No, dollar diving.
[03:16:02.376 --> 03:16:03.116]  America's sinking.
[03:16:05.017 --> 03:16:06.678]  This is the beginning of the death of the dollar.
[03:16:07.678 --> 03:16:10.240]  The world has had enough of the United States' hegemony.
[03:16:11.680 --> 03:16:13.401]  Geopolitically and economically.
[03:16:14.221 --> 03:16:15.582]  I want to go on to some other articles.
[03:16:17.563 --> 03:16:20.464]  Yeah, anyway, go to drpaulcraigroberts.com.
[03:16:21.105 --> 03:16:21.745]  Ron Paul.
[03:16:23.026 --> 03:16:23.586]  Oh, here we go.
[03:16:25.882 --> 03:16:31.024]  Cargo theft spiked 57% in 2003 versus 2002, new data shows.
[03:16:31.084 --> 03:16:35.225]  This is according to Cargonet.
[03:16:37.586 --> 03:16:40.967]  Look at all the stores that are closing up because of violence and crime.
[03:16:42.128 --> 03:16:44.008]  Look at how the theft rates are going up.
[03:16:44.729 --> 03:16:47.210]  This is all a result of the COVID war.
[03:16:47.810 --> 03:16:49.390]  And no one is talking about that.
[03:16:50.971 --> 03:16:51.231]  No one.
[03:16:53.877 --> 03:16:55.878]  Everything spikes since the COVID war.
[03:16:58.659 --> 03:16:59.500]  Mental illness.
[03:17:00.760 --> 03:17:02.201]  China going down the toilet.
[03:17:02.241 --> 03:17:05.782]  They've had three years of zero COVID policy bringing down the whole global economy.
[03:17:06.583 --> 03:17:09.144]  Artificially propped up with record low interest rates.
[03:17:10.504 --> 03:17:12.766]  And trillions of dollars pumped into the economy.
[03:17:14.666 --> 03:17:15.627]  Trump and Biden.
[03:17:16.147 --> 03:17:16.987]  Trillions pumped in.
[03:17:19.489 --> 03:17:20.889]  So, this is serious.
[03:17:22.030 --> 03:17:28.693]   And now, When you look at where the economy is going and you have to put all things connected.
[03:17:28.512 --> 03:17:45.071]  Ukraine just bombed a drone attack at a Russian terminal.
[03:17:45.071 --> 03:17:55.072]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[03:17:46.928 --> 03:17:50.090]  That drove oil prices up 2%.
[03:17:52.279 --> 03:17:55.821]  We have warned from the very beginning Ukraine is going to lose the war.
[03:17:58.562 --> 03:18:00.323]  And everybody knows it now.
[03:18:01.284 --> 03:18:04.306]  Although everybody denied it in the mainstream media when we said it.
[03:18:04.466 --> 03:18:05.386]  And others said it too.
[03:18:05.746 --> 03:18:10.689]  Douglas MacGregor, Scott Ritter, Phil Giraldi, one after another.
[03:18:10.709 --> 03:18:14.031]  We knew that no way they're going to win.
[03:18:14.051 --> 03:18:19.814]  We've warned they're going to do a false flag event or a major attack on a nuclear power plant or something.
[03:18:20.754 --> 03:18:27.118]  That's going to make the people hate Russia again and support Ukraine as their popularity keeps declining.
[03:18:27.138 --> 03:18:29.119]  You saw they were a bust at Davos.
[03:18:29.880 --> 03:18:31.661]  They're not getting the money and weapons they need.
[03:18:32.781 --> 03:18:34.943]  So now, oil prices are up 2%.
[03:18:35.563 --> 03:18:38.965]  Now let's go to what's going on in Israel.
[03:18:40.506 --> 03:18:41.426]  With the Israel war.
[03:18:42.647 --> 03:19:01.121]   Over the weekend, Netanyahu said, by the way Gaza toll, death toll surpasses 25,000.
[03:18:51.398 --> 03:19:01.121]  Over the weekend, Netanyahu said that, are we targeting Iran?
[03:19:01.361 --> 03:19:02.641]  Yes, we've been targeting them.
[03:19:03.342 --> 03:19:03.742]  Wait a minute.
[03:19:06.983 --> 03:19:08.083]  You've been targeting Iran?
[03:19:09.183 --> 03:19:09.344]  Hm.
[03:19:11.404 --> 03:19:13.265]  What if Iran was targeting Israel?
[03:19:13.385 --> 03:19:14.305]  Why, how dare they?
[03:19:15.425 --> 03:19:18.866]  He goes on to say that we want to stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons.
[03:19:19.467 --> 03:19:20.887]  He's been only saying this for how long?
[03:19:23.046 --> 03:19:25.087]  We had a picture in the Trends Journal going back to like 2012.
[03:19:25.127 --> 03:19:33.651]  The artist had a great picture of him at the United Nations with a ticking time bomb.
[03:19:36.292 --> 03:19:36.833]  Now wait a minute.
[03:19:38.073 --> 03:19:41.675]  How many nuclear warheads does Israel have?
[03:19:43.636 --> 03:19:44.837]  Numbers go up as high as 400.
[03:19:44.897 --> 03:19:51.500]  So it's okay for Israel to have nuclear weapons.
[03:19:52.369 --> 03:19:53.050]  But not Iran.
[03:19:53.150 --> 03:19:53.710]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:19:54.911 --> 03:19:55.531]  Oh, okay.
[03:19:57.153 --> 03:19:57.973]  I hear you, BS.
[03:19:59.214 --> 03:20:00.996]  So he says he's targeting Iran.
[03:20:02.937 --> 03:20:05.259]  And Iran's now saying, we're not going to take this anymore.
[03:20:05.299 --> 03:20:12.585]  Just killed a couple more Iranians, military people, in Syria.
[03:20:14.646 --> 03:20:16.408]  And he admitted that they're targeting Iran.
[03:20:17.809 --> 03:20:20.651]  By the way, Netanyahu's popularity rating is in the toilet.
[03:20:23.137 --> 03:20:25.938]  Oh, by the way, his son is still hiding out in Miami.
[03:20:25.978 --> 03:20:26.938]  He's not fighting the war.
[03:20:28.298 --> 03:20:42.137]   elite. If Iran and Israel ramp up military between the two of them, the United States get involved.
[03:20:42.137 --> 03:20:44.137]  evolved.
[03:20:44.163 --> 03:20:44.963]  Oil prices go up 2%.
[03:20:45.003 --> 03:20:47.384]  You're going to read up oil prices went up 80%.
[03:20:47.544 --> 03:20:47.704]  Yeah.
[03:20:52.270 --> 03:20:56.374]  And that's going to crash the global economy and the equity markets.
[03:20:57.875 --> 03:21:00.618]  And probably the end of the world.
[03:21:02.500 --> 03:21:05.402]  Because there's a thing you could look up called the Samson Option.
[03:21:09.786 --> 03:21:10.267]  From Israel.
[03:21:11.348 --> 03:21:12.489]  If they lose, they go nuke.
[03:21:15.952 --> 03:21:16.773]  So we need peace.
[03:21:18.297 --> 03:21:19.738]  And where are all the religions?
[03:21:19.798 --> 03:21:22.400]  How come they're not out there protesting for peace?
[03:21:23.761 --> 03:21:27.183]  Again, I launched Occupy Peace almost a decade ago.
[03:21:28.364 --> 03:21:27.183]  2014.
[03:21:28.544 --> 03:21:35.049]  So, I'm doing everything I can.
[03:21:35.069 --> 03:21:36.930]  Because I see the future.
[03:21:36.950 --> 03:21:37.711]  That's my business.
[03:21:42.074 --> 03:21:42.454]  Trends 2000.
[03:21:42.494 --> 03:21:43.835]  International bestseller.
[03:21:47.728 --> 03:21:50.770]  Trend Tracking, Father of the Megatrends, Time Magazine, Trends Journal.
[03:21:51.351 --> 03:21:55.194]  Again, you get it by going to jonestrends.com, jonestrends.com.
[03:21:55.514 --> 03:21:56.495]  I've been at this a lot of years.
[03:21:56.535 --> 03:21:57.235]  I see the future.
[03:21:58.316 --> 03:21:58.996]  It's hell on earth.
[03:22:01.538 --> 03:22:01.979]  Hell on earth.
[03:22:03.780 --> 03:22:06.162]  You got that little clown boy, Anthony Blinken.
[03:22:06.202 --> 03:22:08.403]  My daddy was ambassador to Hungary.
[03:22:08.444 --> 03:22:11.606]  My uncle was ambassador to Belgium, or to Dalton, or Harvard.
[03:22:13.536 --> 03:22:17.797]  He's at Davos saying, oh, how heartbreaking it is to see the Palestinians being killed.
[03:22:19.258 --> 03:22:27.580]  As he bypasses Congress to send a couple of hundred million dollars of weapons, he keeps slaughtering the people.
[03:22:28.481 --> 03:22:29.941]  What a two-faced little clown.
[03:22:31.081 --> 03:22:32.222]  I'm totally opposed to this.
[03:22:32.662 --> 03:22:33.522]  Totally opposed to it.
[03:22:34.863 --> 03:22:37.383]  Totally, totally, totally opposed to the slaughter going on.
[03:22:38.784 --> 03:22:40.744]  And totally opposed to the thing called settlements.
[03:22:41.605 --> 03:22:42.565]  He's stealing the land.
[03:22:43.231 --> 03:22:51.294]  Violation of the Geneva Convention and the Article 242 of the United Nations.
[03:22:51.754 --> 03:22:58.836]  And again, in your Trends Journal, when Netanyahu got in, the mainstream media called it extreme right-wing government.
[03:22:59.957 --> 03:23:12.741]  And week after week, we wrote about the atrocities that extreme right-wing government was causing against the Palestinians in the, quote, occupied West Bank.
[03:23:15.291 --> 03:23:24.533]  Oh, by the way, it was reported over a thousand mosques have been blown up in Gaza.
[03:23:25.813 --> 03:23:27.773]  What if a thousand synagogues were blown up?
[03:23:29.193 --> 03:23:29.313]  Oh!
[03:23:30.754 --> 03:23:32.654]  And again, don't call me anti-Jewish.
[03:23:33.014 --> 03:23:33.774]  I'm anti-war.
[03:23:34.074 --> 03:23:36.055]  I'm not anti-American because I hate America's wars.
[03:23:36.075 --> 03:23:37.015]  I don't even go into it.
[03:23:38.215 --> 03:23:39.215]  It's a savior crap.
[03:23:42.896 --> 03:23:44.556]  This is disgusting what's going on.
[03:23:46.050 --> 03:23:46.831]  We need peace.
[03:23:47.652 --> 03:23:50.575]  Because if we don't have peace, forget about it.
[03:23:51.075 --> 03:23:52.637]  You got maniacs in charge.
[03:23:53.577 --> 03:23:56.137]  Unless you could think Biden got a brain.
[03:23:56.137 --> 03:24:02.698]  It's the Wizard of Oz, man.
[03:24:02.707 --> 03:24:04.809]  I lost my brain.
[03:24:05.638 --> 03:24:06.598]  Oh no, I got it.
[03:24:06.678 --> 03:24:07.459]  Mitch McConnell.
[03:24:07.899 --> 03:24:08.719]  Oh yeah, he's great.
[03:24:08.979 --> 03:24:10.460]  Oh, how about that little clown boy?
[03:24:10.660 --> 03:24:10.940]  Oh no.
[03:24:11.220 --> 03:24:14.101]  Oh, then Kamala Harris will be president if anything happens to Biden.
[03:24:14.301 --> 03:24:15.341]  Oh, that'd be terrific.
[03:24:15.421 --> 03:24:17.162]  Oh, right there, man.
[03:24:17.182 --> 03:24:19.442]  Oh, and then you got little Mikey Johnson.
[03:24:20.543 --> 03:24:21.143]  Number three.
[03:24:23.223 --> 03:24:28.905]  So listen, do everything you can to support InfoWars because InfoWars is doing everything they can to support you.
[03:24:29.425 --> 03:24:30.146]  Love being on.
[03:24:30.486 --> 03:24:31.406]  I'll see you next week.
[03:24:32.046 --> 03:24:34.287]  I actually feel sorry for the establishment.
[03:24:35.265 --> 03:24:38.827]  They're inbred, they were given the power they have, they're incompetent scum.
[03:24:39.288 --> 03:24:40.048]  Look at Lloyd Austin.
[03:24:40.969 --> 03:24:46.212]  And I remember when they stole the election in 2020.
[03:24:46.392 --> 03:24:50.875]  They told us we should never question another election again.
[03:24:51.576 --> 03:24:54.198]  But isn't that all Democrats have ever done?
[03:24:56.099 --> 03:24:59.401]  And isn't that what Hillary Clinton claimed Trump was going to do in 2020?
[03:25:00.522 --> 03:25:03.204]  She did that because she was butthurt.
[03:25:04.383 --> 03:25:10.304]  She did that because they printed up hundreds of thousands of copies of this Newsweek edition.
[03:25:10.764 --> 03:25:12.245]  It's an actual magazine framed in here.
[03:25:13.965 --> 03:25:19.186]  With her, the supposed 45th President of the United States.
[03:25:19.686 --> 03:25:21.486]  These people are a joke.
[03:25:22.587 --> 03:25:26.107]  They still think corporate media is important.
[03:25:26.147 --> 03:25:27.428]  Let's show folks an overhead shot of that.
[03:25:29.960 --> 03:25:33.382]  They still think being in the New York Times or on CNN is important.
[03:25:34.062 --> 03:25:36.263]  CNN has an average of 100,000 viewers.
[03:25:36.964 --> 03:25:38.224]  Their top show has 100,000.
[03:25:38.544 --> 03:25:43.087]  Joe Rogan has 30, 40, 50 million viewers a week, conservatively.
[03:25:43.407 --> 03:25:43.927]  So do we.
[03:25:46.028 --> 03:25:52.672]  But why do we still see them, even myself, at some levels as the establishment?
[03:25:53.940 --> 03:25:55.201]  As the top of the game.
[03:25:55.421 --> 03:25:55.861]  They're not.
[03:25:55.941 --> 03:25:56.701]  They're a joke.
[03:25:57.222 --> 03:25:57.882]  They're a fraud.
[03:25:58.522 --> 03:26:03.785]  Before I shot this report, I saw this Time Magazine article.
[03:26:03.845 --> 03:26:04.966]  Who reads Time Magazine?
[03:26:05.266 --> 03:26:05.966]  Who looks at this?
[03:26:05.986 --> 03:26:06.566]  Who believes this?
[03:26:06.987 --> 03:26:12.149]  I bet the Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, will show a close shot of that.
[03:26:12.629 --> 03:26:15.111]  I bet he has this framed on his wall.
[03:26:16.431 --> 03:26:19.473]  The last place I'd want to be is on the cover of Time Magazine.
[03:26:19.813 --> 03:26:22.875]  It means you're an establishment loser or worse.
[03:26:23.837 --> 03:26:26.139]  The last place I want to be is in a Hollywood movie.
[03:26:26.459 --> 03:26:28.140]  The power structure is a joke.
[03:26:28.300 --> 03:26:28.841]  It's over.
[03:26:29.181 --> 03:26:29.741]  It's a fraud.
[03:26:29.781 --> 03:26:30.322]  So look at this.
[03:26:31.262 --> 03:26:37.007]  Just like they're trying to hold up Blinken, they tried to hold up Hillary Clinton.
[03:26:37.967 --> 03:26:42.471]  So I remind myself and I remind you of what a joke and what a fraud they are.
[03:26:43.171 --> 03:26:46.473]  And the fact that all their attempts to silence us and to silence you have failed.
[03:26:46.814 --> 03:26:55.189]   And now the whole world Is listening to what we're doing and that credit goes to God and God through you, the viewers and listeners.
[03:26:55.590 --> 03:26:57.531]  You deserve the credit for this broadcast.
[03:26:58.011 --> 03:27:00.092]  You deserve the credit for what we're able to do.
[03:27:00.612 --> 03:27:06.515]  But I want to encourage you to remember how important you are and that we're starting to win.
[03:27:06.735 --> 03:27:09.897]  But if you don't support the broadcast, we can fail.
[03:27:11.221 --> 03:27:12.122]  I need your support.
[03:27:12.302 --> 03:27:14.265]  I've got so many great plans we can execute.
[03:27:14.345 --> 03:27:16.027]  I've proven I'm in the game.
[03:27:16.067 --> 03:27:16.808]  I don't back down.
[03:27:17.028 --> 03:27:18.409]  We have victory in a bottle.
[03:27:18.690 --> 03:27:19.270]  Thanks to God.
[03:27:19.350 --> 03:27:20.091]  Thanks to your support.
[03:27:21.253 --> 03:27:23.075]  But I need you to make the decision.
[03:27:23.155 --> 03:27:25.778]  Those of you on the fence that have never gone to InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:27:27.159 --> 03:27:28.320]  To support the broadcast.

[03:27:30.361 --> 03:27:31.422]  They're great people and we thank them.
[03:27:31.662 --> 03:27:33.603]  But what about all of you that have never gone to the site?
