[00:00:01.025 --> 00:00:01.886]  You can feel it.
[00:00:03.307 --> 00:00:04.267]  Something is off.
[00:00:05.948 --> 00:00:07.970]  Things are getting stranger by the day.
[00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.554]  Just a coincidence, or is something more sinister happening right under our noses?
[00:00:14.354 --> 00:00:16.976]  We want to warn you now, this next story is disturbing.
[00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:29.376]  Namely, in earlier times, it was easier to control a million people, literally, than physically to kill a million people.
[00:00:29.436 --> 00:00:35.299]  Today, it is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control
[00:00:39.503 --> 00:00:45.450]  I would like to reduce the number of people on the planet because there's too many of us.
[00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.714]  It's a planet of finite resources and we're using them up.
[00:00:52.297 --> 00:00:53.779]  First we've got population.
[00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:55.801]  That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[00:00:56.474 --> 00:01:05.580]  Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, healthcare, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15%.
[00:01:06.521 --> 00:01:09.123]  The true ruling elite are a death cult.
[00:01:09.763 --> 00:01:10.504]  Pure evil.
[00:01:11.244 --> 00:01:13.226]  The elite are extremely wealthy.
[00:01:13.726 --> 00:01:15.888]  They have more money than you can think of.
[00:01:16.788 --> 00:01:20.531]  So why would they want even more money, even more control?
[00:01:22.634 --> 00:01:26.717]  It's because they use their wealth and power to execute their agenda.
[00:01:27.338 --> 00:01:28.578]  To live out their evil.
[00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.942]  If you think this is just conspiracy theory, think again.
[00:01:33.562 --> 00:01:34.443]  Look around you.
[00:01:35.323 --> 00:01:38.386]  Everything benefits them, and not humanity.
[00:01:38.746 --> 00:01:40.527]  The globalists have a religion.
[00:01:41.148 --> 00:01:45.251]  To the public it's sold as climate change or the global crisis.
[00:01:46.131 --> 00:01:48.593]  What is the basis of the climate change agenda?
[00:01:49.294 --> 00:01:50.735]  It's population control.
[00:01:52.602 --> 00:01:53.762]  We're good to go.
[00:01:53.782 --> 00:01:54.343]  We're good to go.
[00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:11.849]  We're good to go.
[00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:12.370]  We're good to go.
[00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.931]  Threats of world war.
[00:02:33.371 --> 00:02:38.953]  But behind the scene, it's more about control and backdoor dealings between world governments.
[00:02:39.613 --> 00:02:46.376]  The open border, drug trafficking, human trafficking is covered up and controlled by our own government.
[00:02:46.957 --> 00:02:47.937]  It's deeper than that.
[00:02:49.137 --> 00:02:53.299]  There is a reason why most of these corruption networks never get shut down.
[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.081]  These anti-humanists control mostly everything.
[00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:04.729]  You'd be shocked to know what the people in most power positions really think of the general public.
[00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.933]  The elite's corruption network operates like prison gangs or like a mafia, but on a larger scale.
[00:03:12.593 --> 00:03:13.274]  Blackmail.
[00:03:13.794 --> 00:03:14.514]  Controllers.
[00:03:15.035 --> 00:03:15.575]  Handlers.
[00:03:16.235 --> 00:03:17.036]  Money laundering.
[00:03:17.816 --> 00:03:21.998]  If you want to stay rich and powerful, you'll have to do their dirty work.
[00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:24.340]  They have their hands in everything.
[00:03:25.385 --> 00:03:28.266]  A lot of these players simply love the spotlight.
[00:03:29.006 --> 00:03:34.028]  Most of the celebrities, politicians, CEOs love the fame and fortune.
[00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:38.170]  But the ones at the top of these groups are completely evil.
[00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:45.993]  Many become unwillingly controlled by signing on into the club without knowing what they are actually involved with behind the scenes.
[00:03:46.833 --> 00:03:50.675]  Most of humanity is asleep and distracted by meaninglessness.
[00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:57.412]  The elite are warning us of a cyber attack, also known as a digital 9-11 event.
[00:03:57.993 --> 00:04:01.358]  The economy would collapse if we suffered an internet shutdown.
[00:04:03.513 --> 00:04:07.354]  The modern power grid relies on the internet to coordinate power plants.
[00:04:08.054 --> 00:04:16.377]  Without it, each country's national grid will become unbalanced, and local outages escalate into a blackout for most of the world.
[00:04:17.077 --> 00:04:23.379]  A society slipping into chaos will allow the elite to reset and rebuild a world for themselves.
[00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:26.860]  There will be events leading up to a total collapse.
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.662]  Domestic terror attacks, biological attacks, world wars.
[00:04:32.342 --> 00:04:35.443]  With each event, more and more control is gained.
[00:04:36.323 --> 00:04:37.523]  Time is running out.
[00:04:38.383 --> 00:04:43.544]  If society suffers from any of these trigger events, there might be no turning back.
[00:04:44.104 --> 00:04:45.924]  Humanity is at the crossroads.
[00:04:46.905 --> 00:04:48.385]  This is happening right now.
[00:04:50.385 --> 00:04:56.406]  We need to reject the global agenda and know who the world rulers really are and what they are up to.
[00:04:57.067 --> 00:04:59.187]  The fight for humanity is happening.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:08.982]  Cellular damage from a type of free radical known as reactive oxygen species can cause decreased cellular function.
[00:05:09.342 --> 00:05:16.204]  DNA Force Plus contains what are believed to be the most beneficial ingredients to remedy this.

[00:06:34.677 --> 00:06:39.082]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, January 22nd, 2024.
[00:06:39.182 --> 00:06:50.134]  There are 287 days, 12 hours, 53 minutes, 26 seconds for the most important election in world history.
[00:06:50.775 --> 00:06:56.241]  A referendum on nationalism, freedom, capitalism, security...
[00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:03.854]  Or a tyrannical world government literally waging war against humanity.
[00:07:04.375 --> 00:07:06.997]  The battle is now.
[00:07:08.758 --> 00:07:15.324]  I cannot come up with words enough to hype how epic the historical crossroads we're at right now is.
[00:07:16.145 --> 00:07:17.226]  You don't need me to tell you.
[00:07:17.306 --> 00:07:17.686]  You know it.
[00:07:18.867 --> 00:07:20.989]  We've come so far in this fight against the globalists.
[00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:22.791]  All right, listen.
[00:07:23.806 --> 00:07:44.455]  We have the biggest news yet from the Darien Gap, where the Communist Chinese are officially building highways and bridges out of South America into Panama, where they're also financing with State Department money, with the CHICOMs, gigantic illegal alien gathering centers, UN refugee camps.
[00:07:44.495 --> 00:07:51.237]  There are already huge ones down there, but Jan has now flown more drones in the last few days over it.
[00:07:51.277 --> 00:07:52.518]  He shot the video you see here.
[00:07:54.335 --> 00:08:01.137]  And these facilities are bigger than the Gigantor ones in South Texas on the border.
[00:08:02.317 --> 00:08:08.178]  I mean, we're talking football field after football field after football field of giant white tents.
[00:08:08.878 --> 00:08:11.399]  And you can see all the earth moving equipment building more.
[00:08:12.079 --> 00:08:16.480]  This is a military attack on America.
[00:08:18.288 --> 00:08:18.748]  We're good to go.
[00:08:44.306 --> 00:09:00.317]  Austin, Texas discovered it's the same UN NGOs that run the invasion of Europe and built the giant illegal alien camps out of the Middle East and out of Africa into Europe are the ones running these.
[00:09:00.337 --> 00:09:01.118]  We have the names.
[00:09:01.138 --> 00:09:01.678]  We know the groups.
[00:09:02.179 --> 00:09:10.705]  Michael Yan joins us today, fresh out of the jungle, to break this down from Central America from his hotel room.
[00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:12.331]  Federal pipe bomb January 6th.
[00:09:12.351 --> 00:09:13.532]  False flag that didn't detonate event.
[00:09:13.572 --> 00:09:14.012]  He'll be joining us.
[00:09:14.032 --> 00:09:16.334]  I intend to open the phones up.
[00:09:40.086 --> 00:09:47.551]  On a host of topics in the second hour into the fourth hour with the great Gerald Cilente.
[00:09:48.952 --> 00:09:51.494]  Primary in New Hampshire about to unfold.
[00:09:51.514 --> 00:09:53.015]  We've got all those political developments.
[00:09:54.576 --> 00:09:57.879]  We've got big news out of Ukraine and Russia.
[00:09:57.939 --> 00:10:02.462]  Huge news out of the Middle East with bases, U.S.
[00:10:02.562 --> 00:10:06.305]  bases in Iraq being showered with
[00:10:07.202 --> 00:10:09.503]  Ballistic missiles injuring a bunch of U.S.
[00:10:09.603 --> 00:10:10.103]  forces.
[00:10:11.243 --> 00:10:13.223]  More ships being attacked in the Red Sea.
[00:10:15.124 --> 00:10:17.224]  More missiles raining down into other U.S.
[00:10:17.304 --> 00:10:19.405]  bases on the edge of Syria.
[00:10:20.625 --> 00:10:30.087]  And now Biden has announced that they're going to go ahead and go to full-scale bombing of the Houthis backed by Iran in Yemen.
[00:10:32.065 --> 00:10:35.827]  So things are accelerating towards World War III quite nicely.
[00:10:35.867 --> 00:10:38.128]  In fact, I'd say we're already in the early stages of it.
[00:10:38.148 --> 00:10:39.128]  I think that's fair to say.
[00:10:39.148 --> 00:10:40.389]  Most animals agree with that statement.
[00:10:41.109 --> 00:10:42.630]  But I've got to just say this first.
[00:10:44.571 --> 00:10:47.252]  Oh, there's more WF announcements about how they're going to cut the food off.
[00:10:47.833 --> 00:10:49.273]  And they're listing more food that's evil.
[00:10:51.294 --> 00:10:52.955]  And, of course, it's always the most popular stuff.
[00:10:54.176 --> 00:10:54.516]  Rice.
[00:10:56.297 --> 00:10:56.617]  Beef.
[00:10:58.238 --> 00:10:58.598]  Fish.
[00:11:00.079 --> 00:11:00.559]  Poultry.
[00:11:02.401 --> 00:11:02.641]  Wheat.
[00:11:04.082 --> 00:11:06.104]  And now... Coffee.
[00:11:08.466 --> 00:11:09.547]  Boy, they're in the commodity.
[00:11:09.567 --> 00:11:17.173]  They don't want to say it's bad so they can control it and artificially sequester it so they can jack up the prices of it.
[00:11:17.693 --> 00:11:18.694]  It's all coming up today.
[00:11:18.734 --> 00:11:23.738]  But I want to go back to the theme of last night's Sunday show where I hosted 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:11:23.758 --> 00:11:25.059]  as I've been doing for 16 years.
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.423]  The Sunday edition of this broadcast that I've been doing for 27 years...
[00:11:31.883 --> 00:11:32.323]  We're good to go.
[00:11:57.088 --> 00:12:02.911]  I want to talk about something that is the biggest issue happening in the world today.
[00:12:07.533 --> 00:12:09.754]  And it's two-pronged.
[00:12:09.894 --> 00:12:15.136]  It's political, but it's also spiritual.
[00:12:16.597 --> 00:12:22.980]  And the two things are inexplicably intertwined.
[00:12:26.027 --> 00:12:30.431]  And so, later, got a frog in my throat here.
[00:12:32.193 --> 00:12:35.997]  That's what happens when I forget to eat breakfast and I wolf down a breakfast taco two minutes before I went live.
[00:12:36.017 --> 00:12:40.121]  I think that should do it.
[00:12:43.004 --> 00:12:49.891]  And that is the fact that things aren't going the way the New World Order wanted it to go.
[00:12:53.217 --> 00:12:57.439]  And the globalists have explained to us exactly how they plan to have this takeover unfold.
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:08.225]  And so if we just grow up and look at their own documents and look at their own statements and look at the fact that what they said they'd do 70 years ago, they got done.
[00:13:08.265 --> 00:13:11.227]  And what they said they'd do 50 years ago, they got done.
[00:13:11.267 --> 00:13:13.388]  What they said they'd do 30 years ago, they've gotten done.
[00:13:14.589 --> 00:13:19.992]  And now we really don't want them to get the rest of it done because now we're in the endgame.
[00:13:21.127 --> 00:13:21.928]  I think we're good to go.
[00:13:47.145 --> 00:13:58.172]  We always said that we'll go from beta to absolute war mode against humanity in 2020, completing the conquest and extermination of almost everyone by 2047.
[00:13:58.252 --> 00:14:04.776]  The world, as you know, will be over with billions dead by 2030.
[00:14:04.957 --> 00:14:12.942]  And these are really staggering statements, but when everybody from Bill Gates to Jane Goodall
[00:14:14.195 --> 00:14:14.916]  We're good to go.
[00:14:30.489 --> 00:14:32.110]  We're good to go.
[00:14:59.454 --> 00:15:17.021]  Because if they carry these operations out and aren't billed as the saviors, or if they're not casted in the role of the saviors, they will all be destroyed long before they implement it.
[00:15:17.081 --> 00:15:23.043]  So they must be in the position of the guardians of the earth while they kill it.
[00:15:24.344 --> 00:15:27.065]  They must be in position of the guardians of the nation states.
[00:15:28.609 --> 00:15:29.089]  We're good to go.
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:16:08.304]  Then political leaders around the world talking about it, and the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and Politico running headlines saying, globalism is not trusted, it's hated, and everyone's coming against us.
[00:16:09.305 --> 00:16:09.925]  What do we do?
[00:16:10.505 --> 00:16:13.106]  And they say, well, the number one mission is censor people more.
[00:16:14.206 --> 00:16:16.107]  That's how we make them trust us.
[00:16:16.207 --> 00:16:17.407]  We just lie to them more.
[00:16:18.708 --> 00:16:21.989]  So we've really reached beyond the tipping point.
[00:16:22.449 --> 00:16:25.050]  The tipping point was in about the last 12 months, about a year ago.
[00:16:26.912 --> 00:16:27.493]  We're good to go.
[00:16:54.431 --> 00:17:04.014]  The globalists always intended to have a societal, cultural, industrial tipping point, and out of that crisis they would get total control and just a nightmare mad scientist society.
[00:17:05.535 --> 00:17:22.041]  But instead of there's a tipping point and a capsizing and a submersion of civilization, if as we go under we know they're the ones that sucked us under, what are they going to do?
[00:17:24.002 --> 00:17:28.666]  Well, they're going to try to get the boat turned back up because they know they're going down with us.
[00:17:29.607 --> 00:17:30.988]  In fact, they're going down the hardest.
[00:17:31.708 --> 00:17:51.926]  So this is simple cause and effect, simple politics, but because people weren't facing there was a corporate world government, even as it was set up, even as they were bragging about it and saying their aims of just you'll drink sewage water, you'll live in a 250 square foot coffin apartment in 5G, bathing, you will eat bugs, you will...
[00:17:52.995 --> 00:18:00.259]  Your convicted pedophiles will come as high priest and bounce your children on their leg in elementary school and preschool.
[00:18:01.739 --> 00:18:05.881]  People are just like, come on, it's not really that bad.
[00:18:05.901 --> 00:18:09.203]  Yeah, it is.
[00:18:10.163 --> 00:18:12.464]  So the bad news is we're in a lot of trouble.
[00:18:14.065 --> 00:18:15.286]  The good news is...
[00:18:17.577 --> 00:18:26.663]  That everything they had planned was to be the saviors during this crisis, and instead, people are going, oh, you did this.
[00:18:27.784 --> 00:18:34.529]  And now they're learning all about their governmental systems and all about their central bank digital currencies and all about their ESGs.
[00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:37.391]  Spiritual... Physical... Death...
[00:19:05.427 --> 00:19:33.679]  And so we need to just, I think, ponder and reflect on the fact that thanks to all the old-timers in the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s that talked about this and wrote books and had their little conferences and fought like hell to get the word out that the second big wave that began in the early 1990s against the New World Order, when they began to roll out of Gen 21 and as it became public,
[00:19:34.887 --> 00:19:35.247]  I think?
[00:20:00.694 --> 00:20:05.677]  Then you're fighting a losing battle because you cut one head off, it just grows two more.
[00:20:06.697 --> 00:20:15.581]  But if you capture the beast and throw it off the edge of a 10,000-foot cliff, it's going to break its back and die.
[00:20:16.682 --> 00:20:18.183]  And so I'd use the analogy of not us.
[00:20:19.474 --> 00:20:29.998]  Even five minutes of the Hydra, but us just as a mass running headlong, billions of us, that's a giant wave a thousand times bigger than the New World Order Hydra.
[00:20:30.718 --> 00:20:32.699]  He looks real big until you pull back and see us.
[00:20:32.979 --> 00:20:41.223]  We're a giant wave, and all we got to do is crash into the Hydra that's on the edge of a cliff, and it will go over.
[00:20:41.663 --> 00:20:42.443]  Here's the thing, though.
[00:20:42.723 --> 00:20:44.544]  We don't even need 10% of the wave to hit.
[00:20:46.192 --> 00:20:50.554]  Because, yeah, those that do this will go over with the globalists over the edge of the cliff.
[00:20:51.094 --> 00:20:52.275]  Not spiritually, but physically.
[00:20:52.855 --> 00:20:57.718]  A lot of us have to still understand that in this next phase, this is a kamikaze operation.
[00:20:58.178 --> 00:21:09.003]  We don't want to wait until things get so bad that the whole wave hits them, because then the waves going off the edge of the cliff, because the globalist plan would have been so far progressed, we will fall with them.
[00:21:09.584 --> 00:21:13.566]  It's up to us, the men, the serious men and women that wish to join us,
[00:21:14.554 --> 00:21:15.054]  We're good to go.
[00:21:38.194 --> 00:21:50.046]  All those archetypes and the hero of a thousand faces comes from experiences and things that have happened over and over and over again in history.
[00:21:51.087 --> 00:21:52.828]  And so we're at that major turning point.
[00:21:53.209 --> 00:21:55.291]  We're at that major event horizon right now.
[00:21:55.311 --> 00:21:57.973]  And I've already gone past the point of return.
[00:21:58.354 --> 00:22:02.618]  And I hope you realize that if the general public doesn't get behind men like me,
[00:22:04.281 --> 00:22:13.729]  And if we don't get behind people like Tucker Carlson and President Trump and Elon Musk, and none of these people are perfect, but I know I believe in a pro-human future.
[00:22:14.049 --> 00:22:15.251]  I don't believe in depopulation.
[00:22:15.531 --> 00:22:18.373]  Neither does Donald Trump, neither does Elon Musk, neither does Tucker Carlson.
[00:22:19.034 --> 00:22:21.676]  That if you don't get behind us, you are suicidal.
[00:22:22.277 --> 00:22:22.777]  You're crazy.
[00:22:25.019 --> 00:22:26.480]  But I just want listeners to let that burn in.
[00:22:27.081 --> 00:22:29.163]  This isn't just some flavor of politics.
[00:22:29.203 --> 00:22:31.685]  This show isn't just some interesting novelty.
[00:22:33.021 --> 00:22:41.449]  If you go back 25 years ago, or 10 years ago, or 5 years ago, when you listen to this show, you'll think this guy's a time traveler.
[00:22:41.649 --> 00:22:42.009]  I'm not.
[00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:44.512]  The enemy has a frickin' blueprint, okay?
[00:22:45.916 --> 00:22:56.463]  So it's like, if they were destroying part of a city and building a new city there, and I had the blueprint, and I went to people and said, okay, in a couple years they're going to bulldozer all this, and they're going to build a building here and there, and people don't know what blueprints are.
[00:22:56.803 --> 00:22:59.305]  I've got this fictional world I'm talking about, and they think you're a weirdo.
[00:22:59.585 --> 00:23:03.968]  But they suddenly see the bulldozer show up, and over the next few years, it all gets destroyed, and they build a new city.
[00:23:04.428 --> 00:23:05.769]  Later, they're like, he's magic.
[00:23:05.849 --> 00:23:07.170]  He knew they were going to do this.
[00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:08.490]  No, I'm not magic.
[00:23:10.492 --> 00:23:15.275]  And that's the most frustrating part about this, is people either say I'm psychic, and everybody's psychic to a certain extent,
[00:23:17.336 --> 00:23:19.496]  Or I'm being secret information.
[00:23:20.957 --> 00:23:22.397]  It's not secret, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:23.137 --> 00:23:25.117]  So I got all this news to hit, and we're going to hit it.
[00:23:25.918 --> 00:23:34.239]  But if you missed last night's show, particularly the first hour... I really hit it the second hour, excuse me.
[00:23:35.239 --> 00:23:42.781]  The second hour, we did a good job of explaining this, and I went over a bunch of Davos clubs, and it was very, very important.
[00:23:42.841 --> 00:23:44.201]  So this is a big deal.
[00:23:45.373 --> 00:23:47.634]  And we're covering the heart of the Hydra here.
[00:23:48.314 --> 00:23:53.416]  We're covering what it is, what its plans are, what it's doing, how to stop it.
[00:23:54.617 --> 00:24:11.484]  It's like I go on X every day and I'm, here's this UN treaty, here's the UN land grab, here's how they're doing it, here's how the State Department funds the NGOs with the Communist Chinese to build the refugee centers and they're building roads from South America all the way up to Mexico and into the United States.
[00:24:11.864 --> 00:24:13.525]  We need to cut the State Department money.
[00:24:16.172 --> 00:24:17.093]  We're good to go.
[00:24:30.754 --> 00:24:44.478]  And sure, there's globalists in all those groups, but I'm like, here's the legislation, here's the executive order, here's the UN funding, here's the treaty, here's video of where these bases are, here's the roads, call Congress, get them to cut the funding.
[00:24:44.758 --> 00:24:47.519]  Like, I'm trying to do real world stuff.
[00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:56.682]  And I know it's fun to kind of stay in the 1980s, 1990s, oh look, the CERN symbols, three sixes.
[00:24:58.530 --> 00:24:59.090]  Yeah, I know.
[00:24:59.151 --> 00:25:00.391]  They're openly devil worshippers.
[00:25:00.892 --> 00:25:01.652]  I'll cover that later.
[00:25:02.233 --> 00:25:03.354]  They're openly saying it now.
[00:25:03.374 --> 00:25:04.795]  They're not hiding it in symbols anymore.
[00:25:08.778 --> 00:25:11.940]  But again, we can cut the money off from these guys.
[00:25:12.841 --> 00:25:19.926]  But once they get their cashless society in, once they get their social credit score in, it's going to be much harder to turn this around.
[00:25:20.247 --> 00:25:21.528]  And the Bible tells us
[00:25:22.432 --> 00:25:24.113]  Well, regardless of what you think...
[00:25:51.854 --> 00:25:52.475]  We're good to go.
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.161]  We're good to go.
[00:26:07.181 --> 00:26:07.321]  I think?
[00:26:23.806 --> 00:26:24.606]  This is a test.
[00:26:25.307 --> 00:26:29.409]  And we're not meant to just sit here and watch this happen to our children and other children.
[00:26:29.869 --> 00:26:34.151]  We're not supposed to sit here and go, oh, the New World Order is too big, it's too powerful, Satan is too powerful.
[00:26:34.631 --> 00:26:38.153]  Our God is infinity more powerful than Satan.
[00:26:41.194 --> 00:26:43.055]  And you can say, well, Satan doesn't exist.
[00:26:43.435 --> 00:26:49.958]  Look around you at people doing evil, even when it hurts them, because it's the desire of their heart and of their father, the devil.
[00:26:50.851 --> 00:26:56.977]  So whether you believe in that entity or not, that the spirit, the manifestation of it, it's a real thing in action.
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:05.326]  And so this world is already going through incredible crisis.
[00:27:06.527 --> 00:27:12.453]  If you live in the West, crime's up, you don't have as much money, there's problems, mental illness exploding, suicide, death.
[00:27:13.732 --> 00:27:15.993]  Cancer exploding, live expectancy is going down.
[00:27:16.333 --> 00:27:24.455]  In the third world, last time the UN put numbers out, five, six months ago, they admitted 80-plus million people have starved to death because of the lockdowns.
[00:27:25.716 --> 00:27:29.077]  They say because of the virus, and the response to it, no, was by their fear-mongering.
[00:27:30.017 --> 00:27:31.218]  Where's the news coverage of that?
[00:27:31.258 --> 00:27:31.978]  Just a footnote.
[00:27:32.118 --> 00:27:33.438]  Oh, the UN needs more money.
[00:27:33.818 --> 00:27:38.780]  The last four years, 80-something million extra people starved to death because there was no jobs and no food.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.961]  See, a lockdown here, you just exhaust your bank account.
[00:27:43.561 --> 00:27:44.502]  Maybe lose your house.
[00:27:45.783 --> 00:27:48.525]  A lockdown in the third world means you starve to death.
[00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:58.833]  And then the very NGOs that call for the lockdowns go, oh, give us money.
[00:28:00.275 --> 00:28:01.696]  The third world's starving to death.
[00:28:03.008 --> 00:28:19.233]  And again, I can sit here and cover all the new news and all the new clips and cover all this other interesting heads of the Hydras or whiskers on the Hydras or a tooth on the Hydra or a wart on the Hydra's head and we can attack the wart and we can attack a speck in its eye and we can stab them in the face all we want.
[00:28:20.612 --> 00:28:26.916]  You stab a hydrant, blood sprays out and flails around, and you bring down one of these people politically, but they just sprouts one more.
[00:28:27.337 --> 00:28:34.662]  You got to get into the guts of it, and you got to run your sword into the guts.
[00:28:37.444 --> 00:28:38.745]  You got to get it into that heart.
[00:28:40.406 --> 00:28:41.447]  That's an analogy, media.
[00:28:41.507 --> 00:28:44.569]  I'm not saying any hydrants were harmed in this segment.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.260]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:48.282]  Infowars.com tomorrow's news today.
[00:28:48.762 --> 00:28:51.144]  But the globalists, their narrative is not working.
[00:28:51.204 --> 00:28:52.024]  Everybody knows it's them.
[00:28:52.284 --> 00:28:53.105]  They are screwed.
[00:28:53.385 --> 00:28:54.546]  But they're still going to go through with it.
[00:28:55.467 --> 00:29:02.231]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[00:29:02.391 --> 00:29:02.731]  Thank you.
[00:29:02.932 --> 00:29:05.493]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[00:29:05.573 --> 00:29:06.814]  I started taking that stuff.
[00:29:06.854 --> 00:29:10.056]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[00:29:10.156 --> 00:29:11.077]  When did you start taking it?
[00:29:11.357 --> 00:29:15.160]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure, and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:15.320]  Mm-hmm.
[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:16.041]  Mm-hmm.
[00:29:16.061 --> 00:29:16.181]  Mm-hmm.
[00:29:32.279 --> 00:29:46.186]  And even though I do think all your other products are good, I recommend to anybody that they start with X2 iodine because it detoxifies your body and kind of kicks your natural DNA into full force.
[00:29:46.246 --> 00:29:49.728]  So in my life, I found X2 iodine the best.
[00:29:50.188 --> 00:29:53.630]  I tried other iodines and they didn't have the same effect.
[00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:56.232]  So X2 iodine, I really wanted to point that out.
[00:30:00.345 --> 00:30:01.145]  Winter is coming.
[00:30:01.826 --> 00:30:03.847]  Winter is coming.
[00:30:04.247 --> 00:30:04.988]  Winter is coming.
[00:30:05.308 --> 00:30:06.408]  Winter is coming.
[00:30:07.449 --> 00:30:08.890]  Winter is coming.
[00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:10.651]  Winter isn't coming.
[00:30:11.231 --> 00:30:12.512]  Winter is here.
[00:30:12.912 --> 00:30:20.436]  And while the sun isn't helping us produce as much vitamin D, do yourself a favor and try InfoWars Life Winter Sun Plus.

[00:30:59.791 --> 00:31:01.572]  Real death is shutting off the economy.
[00:31:01.772 --> 00:31:04.074]  The bureaucrats and the corporations control the economy.
[00:31:04.394 --> 00:31:07.896]  As they vertically integrate the economy and consolidate power, they murder people en masse.
[00:31:08.537 --> 00:31:15.742]  And Elon Musk has warned them that if you destroy civilization, you won't be able to have certain redoubts of it and certain city-states that still have it.
[00:31:15.762 --> 00:31:18.143]  The Hunger Games model, it will destroy the elite as well.
[00:31:18.404 --> 00:31:21.186]  And anybody that studies history and has common sense knows that.
[00:31:21.866 --> 00:31:26.849]  The wars that are going to come out of the starvation and the inflation are being blamed on global warming.
[00:31:27.069 --> 00:31:29.771]  The viruses that come out of the labs are being blamed on global warming.
[00:31:30.011 --> 00:31:33.433]  The third world hordes being organized by the UN to invade are being blamed on global warming.
[00:31:34.274 --> 00:31:35.975]  The mass starvation is blamed on the virus.
[00:31:37.416 --> 00:31:39.637]  And everywhere we're told it's going to get worse.
[00:31:39.737 --> 00:31:40.698]  Billions are coming.
[00:31:40.858 --> 00:31:43.200]  Al Gore and Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton.
[00:31:44.096 --> 00:31:51.242]  And the Rothschilds and the Davos Group and Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and Yvonne O'Harrari say billions are coming to Europe.
[00:31:51.462 --> 00:31:52.943]  A billion are coming to the U.S.
[00:31:53.404 --> 00:31:54.685]  because of climate change.
[00:31:55.205 --> 00:31:59.629]  No, because you cut their economy off because the IMF or World Bank controls the loans and ordered lockdowns.
[00:32:00.009 --> 00:32:03.732]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[00:32:04.052 --> 00:32:07.235]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[00:32:07.635 --> 00:32:12.079]  Because they can't get through this giant megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[00:32:12.699 --> 00:32:14.840]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:23.125]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's You Will Eat the Bugs.
[00:32:23.746 --> 00:32:29.489]  This is The Great Awakening, the plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[00:32:29.969 --> 00:32:33.511]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[00:32:33.771 --> 00:32:36.233]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.

[00:32:57.253 --> 00:32:58.915]  The Great Awakening at InfoWarsStore.
[00:33:01.303 --> 00:33:07.224]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:11.451 --> 00:33:30.124]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:30.444 --> 00:33:37.810]  All right, next hour, I'm going to plunge into The Globalist, making more announcements about all the food and commodities they're going to cut off.
[00:33:38.717 --> 00:33:41.439]  Including coffee to save the planet.
[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:46.003]  We've got the big news, obviously, on the New Hampshire primary coming up tomorrow.
[00:33:46.723 --> 00:33:49.986]  We've got massive military news and so much more.
[00:33:50.006 --> 00:33:55.711]  And I'm going to get more into the globalists in their own publications saying, we're done, we're being destroyed, everyone hates us.
[00:33:57.052 --> 00:34:07.941]  Oh, you haven't figured it out yet that I've seen videos on Instagram with 40 million views and you've got hundreds of thousands of comments and I can't find one that doesn't hate Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and the New World Order?
[00:34:08.985 --> 00:34:10.566]  Yeah, you guys are screwed.
[00:34:11.986 --> 00:34:13.407]  Roger Stone talked about it yesterday on air.
[00:34:14.247 --> 00:34:15.688]  Everywhere he goes, everybody just loves him.
[00:34:15.748 --> 00:34:17.189]  Black, white, Hispanic, old, young.
[00:34:17.209 --> 00:34:18.289]  He used to get tons of hate.
[00:34:18.609 --> 00:34:19.129]  Same with me.
[00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:23.251]  In the last year and a half, I think I've been yelled at twice.
[00:34:23.271 --> 00:34:24.872]  It used to happen every time I went out in public.
[00:34:26.113 --> 00:34:27.493]  This is a big deal, folks.
[00:34:27.653 --> 00:34:32.535]  And world leaders confronting the globalists and saying they're criminals to their faces last week?
[00:34:34.076 --> 00:34:36.097]  But they need to gain the world's trust back.
[00:34:37.076 --> 00:34:38.118]  Now, they're not going to give up, though.
[00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:40.661]  They're going to stage crises, launch wars.
[00:34:40.701 --> 00:34:42.624]  They're trying to launch a race war here in America.
[00:34:43.005 --> 00:34:48.093]  They've got the Fed front running around to create this illusion of masked right-wing supremacists out there.
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:49.940]  We're good to go.
[00:34:49.981 --> 00:34:50.181]  I think?
[00:35:14.594 --> 00:35:15.354]  We're good to go.
[00:35:15.375 --> 00:35:15.695]  I think?
[00:35:44.424 --> 00:35:52.987]  There's an amazing push to damage control, but I think the regime understands that it can't be entirely contained at this point.
[00:35:53.327 --> 00:36:03.010]  There's a whole universe of investigation that we created related to the pipe bomb over the course of years of major groundbreaking reports.
[00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:08.191]  But this latest breakthrough comes courtesy of a Capitol Police video.
[00:36:08.231 --> 00:36:13.153]  Now, there's been a lot of talk about, oh, the Capitol Police footage and the new speaker had
[00:36:13.814 --> 00:36:18.801]  I promised to release the full 40,000 hours, but initially released something like 90.
[00:36:19.482 --> 00:36:24.188]  And there was all this talk about it, you know, the Capitol Police or the flashbangs and this or that.
[00:36:24.749 --> 00:36:30.517]  And my attitude toward the release footage has always been it's very useful in terms of.
[00:36:31.001 --> 00:36:31.602]  We're good to go.
[00:36:49.571 --> 00:37:01.873]  There's one piece of footage, however, that until recently went largely unnoticed that comes courtesy of Thomas Massey, which I think amounts to a true breakthrough in the pipe bomb case.
[00:37:02.403 --> 00:37:02.623]  I think?
[00:37:23.326 --> 00:37:24.127]  So here it is.
[00:37:24.207 --> 00:37:32.315]  And this is the clip that's the subject of a mega viral thread and that I contextualize in a really bombshell piece on Revolver.News.
[00:37:32.375 --> 00:37:36.279]  And so I'll walk your audience through it a little bit.
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:41.905]  So it starts out and I see you guys are a little bit ahead of me on the B-roll.
[00:37:41.945 --> 00:37:42.846]  So I don't know if you can
[00:37:43.769 --> 00:37:46.650]  You can start from the beginning if you want.
[00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:50.351]  We'll start from the beginning in a minute, but explain to people why this is so big.
[00:37:50.891 --> 00:37:55.973]  And again, the response of the panic shows you where there's smoke, there's fire, just like they would try to sue anybody.
[00:37:55.993 --> 00:38:00.014]  We're talking about Seth Rich, and now we know there was a cover-up in that.
[00:38:00.094 --> 00:38:03.835]  So they are very afraid of this, just like we saw around Ray Epps.
[00:38:05.723 --> 00:38:06.324]  Absolutely.
[00:38:06.344 --> 00:38:11.848]  I mean, I've always said, based on our research, there's two smoking guns of the Fed's erection.
[00:38:12.368 --> 00:38:14.670]  One is Ray Epps, the other is the pipe bomb.
[00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:26.719]  And incidentally, these two stories, as the pipe bomb story unfolds and unravels with finality, the Ray Epps story and the pipe bomb story will converge.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:30.022]  Perhaps not necessarily with Ray Epps himself,
[00:38:30.785 --> 00:38:53.552]  But the story of that first, that initial attack on the west perimeter of the Capitol by the Peace Monument at 1253, that story will converge with the pipe bomb story because one of the smoking guns of the pipe bomb story, which we've reported on extensively for years, is the remarkably coincidental timing of the pipe bombs' discovery.
[00:38:54.392 --> 00:38:55.532]  We're good to go.
[00:38:55.592 --> 00:38:55.972]  I think?
[00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:30.315]  That's three minutes before the Ray Epps breach on the west perimeter.
[00:39:30.735 --> 00:39:37.901]  That iconic footage by the bike rack where Ray Epps is whispering in a guy's ear, that occurred at 1253.
[00:39:38.362 --> 00:39:42.585]  Capitol Police begin responding to the first pipe bomb at 1250.
[00:39:43.726 --> 00:39:45.307]  Three-minute time span.
[00:39:45.748 --> 00:39:52.073]  And then, as we see in this new footage, which is footage of the DNC bomb being discovered, this begins at 105.
[00:39:54.654 --> 00:40:03.904]  So, scarcely 15 minutes after that first pipe bomb is discovered, the second one is discovered in a video that I'll explain shortly.
[00:40:03.924 --> 00:40:08.429]  And for those that are missing it, for Democrats that are tuned in, I understand they have low IQs, I'm serious.
[00:40:08.929 --> 00:40:10.371]  This shows coordination.
[00:40:10.951 --> 00:40:12.733]  It's all been coordinated for that time.
[00:40:13.654 --> 00:40:15.116]  Well, Alex, let me tell you this.
[00:40:15.609 --> 00:40:34.461]  The timing was so profoundly, the synchronicity was so profoundly striking that the publicly endorsed theory by then head of the Capitol Police Steve Sun was that the pipe bombs were never intended to go off, but rather they were implanted.
[00:40:34.943 --> 00:40:39.167]  Yeah, for those that don't know, an egg timer isn't digital, so it only is an hour long.
[00:40:39.187 --> 00:40:40.628]  So again, it's ridiculous.
[00:40:40.648 --> 00:40:40.728]  Yeah.
[00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:09.116]  Forensics explosive report, there's no remote detonation capability.
[00:41:09.196 --> 00:41:15.417]  So if the person actually intended for the bomb to go off, it would have gone off at most an hour after being planted.
[00:41:15.497 --> 00:41:17.377]  So around 9 p.m.
[00:41:17.417 --> 00:41:20.558]  in a back alley would be a total dud, totally meaningless.
[00:41:21.258 --> 00:41:31.480]  So the theory that these were planted as a diversion corresponds with the mechanical timer issue and also, most strikingly, with the timing of their discovery.
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:32.880]  What are the chances?
[00:41:33.305 --> 00:41:51.439]  That these pipe bombs are sitting around, the DNC one sitting around for 17 hours, the RNC one for 16 hours, undiscovered, and then magically both are discovered within a 15-minute window of the initial attack on the Capitol and certification proceeding.
[00:41:51.819 --> 00:41:54.061]  There's simply no way that that's a coincidence.
[00:41:54.401 --> 00:41:55.262]  The only problem is...
[00:41:56.184 --> 00:42:07.007]  If these were planted as an intended diversion, how did the pipe bomber count on, one, a random pedestrian, and two, a plainclothes Capitol Police officer?
[00:42:07.027 --> 00:42:12.269]  How did he count on these people discovering the bomb within a 15-minute timeframe?
[00:42:12.729 --> 00:42:17.717]  And then you talk about the footage and we'll get to that.
[00:42:17.797 --> 00:42:20.621]  That question I will leave as an exercise for the reader.
[00:42:21.062 --> 00:42:27.852]  So now let's go to the video footage that is so explosive and even as a self-contained matter, the footage is remarkable.
[00:42:28.292 --> 00:42:42.324]  So the footage begins at around 1.05, again, scarcely 15 minutes after the first one was discovered, where an individual with a backpack comes into frame and walks over to a Metro PD SUV.
[00:42:43.105 --> 00:42:48.790]  Now, both the Metro PD SUV and the black SUV are part of Kamala Harris's
[00:42:49.912 --> 00:42:51.892]  Protection detail in the Secret Service.
[00:42:51.952 --> 00:42:56.633]  Kamala Harris, then VP-elect, was in the building, the DNC building at the time.
[00:42:57.033 --> 00:42:58.954]  So here's the guy we can watch in real time.
[00:42:58.974 --> 00:43:10.476]  He's approaching the vehicle, and he informs both cars, both Secret Service details, that there's a pipe bomb within feet of them.
[00:43:11.616 --> 00:43:14.017]  Now, the thing that's striking about this...
[00:43:14.813 --> 00:43:20.155]  Is that there's zero concern whatsoever in reaction to this information.
[00:43:20.415 --> 00:43:22.635]  Now, the first thing you do is you move the vehicles away.
[00:43:22.655 --> 00:43:25.756]  You tell everybody in the building, evacuate.
[00:43:26.577 --> 00:43:31.918]  And the clips are on my Twitter thread, so possibly your guys can, like, B-roll it along.
[00:43:32.078 --> 00:43:34.999]  So here are the guys informing the vehicles.
[00:43:35.619 --> 00:43:40.941]  Now it's going to be over a minute before they even bother getting out of the vehicles.
[00:43:41.577 --> 00:43:42.058]  We're good to go.
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:04.421]  Right by that bench.
[00:44:28.485 --> 00:44:46.112]  So either they have no preservation instincts and completely and flagrantly violate protocol that would pertain to the discovery of a bomb as a Secret Service agent, or somehow they knew that the bomb was fake.
[00:44:46.712 --> 00:44:49.753]  And then again, another troubling question emerges.
[00:44:50.714 --> 00:44:51.934]  How do they know it's fake?
[00:44:51.974 --> 00:44:53.635]  Look at them just casually standing around.
[00:44:53.715 --> 00:44:54.155]  Look at it.
[00:44:55.445 --> 00:44:59.748]  They're letting this group of children cross the street and walk within feet of where the bomb is.
[00:45:00.088 --> 00:45:02.810]  Do these people look at all concerned about the bomb?
[00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.531]  No.
[00:45:03.811 --> 00:45:05.292]  How do they know it's fake?
[00:45:06.994 --> 00:45:08.054]  How do they know that?
[00:45:08.074 --> 00:45:12.695]  I mean, their body language is like they are walking over to a snow cone stand or something.
[00:45:13.635 --> 00:45:14.536]  How do they know that?
[00:45:14.816 --> 00:45:15.616]  Now watch this.
[00:45:15.976 --> 00:45:20.917]  Shortly after, there's going to be a Capitol Police officer that comes into the right side of the frame.
[00:45:21.257 --> 00:45:23.378]  He's going to walk right up to it and take a picture.
[00:45:23.418 --> 00:45:23.778]  Look at that.
[00:45:23.858 --> 00:45:24.898]  It's on the right-hand side.
[00:45:24.958 --> 00:45:25.458]  Look at this.
[00:45:26.338 --> 00:45:27.218]  He's taking a picture.
[00:45:28.259 --> 00:45:29.779]  Thumbs up, and then he leaves.
[00:45:30.259 --> 00:45:34.860]  And then for the first time ever, they actually speed things up and they get the hell out of there.
[00:45:35.776 --> 00:45:37.137]  It's the first time they ever move.
[00:45:38.478 --> 00:45:38.898]  Look at this.
[00:45:39.459 --> 00:45:40.660]  They're getting the hell out of there.
[00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:42.441]  Because now it's time to be part of the production.
[00:45:42.481 --> 00:45:43.582]  Now it's time to look secure.
[00:45:44.483 --> 00:45:46.024]  And here's the crazy thing.
[00:45:46.344 --> 00:45:48.546]  So they're unconcerned for themselves.
[00:45:48.626 --> 00:45:50.067]  They're unconcerned for the children.
[00:45:50.107 --> 00:45:52.209]  They don't care about Kamala Harris.
[00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:53.110]  And yet...
[00:45:53.689 --> 00:45:54.009]  I think?
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:14.221]  To diffuse this pipe bomb.
[00:46:14.621 --> 00:46:22.023]  The bomb that they just let children walk right by, it's safe enough for that, but it's so dangerous they need to use a bomb-safe robot.
[00:46:22.043 --> 00:46:23.883]  Sure, that's where the theater comes in.
[00:46:23.943 --> 00:46:24.923]  That's the theater.
[00:46:25.263 --> 00:46:31.265]  Now, let me just reinforce some contextual facts on this.
[00:46:31.758 --> 00:46:36.480]  Now, this is a Secret Service detail that's exhibiting such bizarre behavior.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.301]  Now, why is a Secret Service there in the first place?
[00:46:39.341 --> 00:46:44.563]  Well, as I mentioned, Kamala Harris, who was then VP-elect, was in the DNC building.
[00:46:44.863 --> 00:46:49.545]  Here's something crazy, Alex, and I know you know this, but it's really important to emphasize.
[00:46:49.825 --> 00:46:52.606]  This is going to be a big part of how this all blows up in their face.
[00:46:54.267 --> 00:47:00.970]  Kamala Harris kept it secret that she was in the DNC building on January 6th.
[00:47:02.387 --> 00:47:03.247]  We're good to go.
[00:47:28.823 --> 00:47:29.103]  It's...
[00:47:54.481 --> 00:47:56.182]  It's simply inexplicable.
[00:47:56.282 --> 00:47:58.822]  It does not lend itself to an innocent explanation.
[00:47:58.862 --> 00:48:03.523]  Think furthermore, you know, you've made a big deal about this, and rightly so.
[00:48:03.864 --> 00:48:08.325]  Think about Joe Biden's big speech on the third anniversary of January 6th.
[00:48:08.785 --> 00:48:17.567]  Imagine him foregoing the opportunity to mention that his vice president almost lost her life to the pipe bomb.
[00:48:18.287 --> 00:48:20.608]  Why would he neglect to mention that?
[00:48:22.538 --> 00:48:33.342]  The truth has to be so dark and so damning and so embarrassing for them to cover it up when it goes completely against their political interests.
[00:48:33.382 --> 00:48:35.563]  And it's not as though they moved on from January 6th.
[00:48:36.596 --> 00:48:39.177]  Biden gave this huge speech on the 30th anniversary.
[00:48:39.217 --> 00:48:45.200]  They're running on Trump's the dictator, they're planning a takeover, they're going to have martial law, they're going to kill us all.
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:52.723]  Let me ask you this, doctor, and finish up other points on this, but larger picture, then we move into speculation.
[00:48:53.163 --> 00:48:54.624]  What do you think really went on?
[00:48:55.504 --> 00:48:56.625]  What was supposed to happen?
[00:48:57.105 --> 00:48:59.666]  Why are they always never wanting to talk about the pipe bomb?
[00:49:00.346 --> 00:49:03.668]  I mean, I guess we're forced to speculate, but clearly something's been covered up here.
[00:49:05.902 --> 00:49:07.603]  Yeah, I mean, it's clear a cover-up.
[00:49:07.723 --> 00:49:11.206]  I am 100% certain this is a cover-up.
[00:49:11.506 --> 00:49:13.507]  This is a phony operation.
[00:49:13.627 --> 00:49:23.954]  And, you know, usually these things, we get to the point where any reasonable in-person digesting information in good faith comes to an obvious conclusion.
[00:49:24.235 --> 00:49:27.457]  And I think that's where we are based on our extensive reporting on Ray Epps.
[00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:28.940]  One other thing, Alex.
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:32.102]  When this happens, I guarantee you, the feds and people responsible for this operation...
[00:49:56.018 --> 00:50:01.199]  They are scrambling and brainstorming right now to think about how they can maximize damage control.
[00:50:01.519 --> 00:50:16.842]  Number one, by feeding the final steps of this story to more domesticated journalists so Revolver News doesn't get credit because they don't want to lend legitimacy to us because then the next thing we cover can't be ignored and they can't dismiss it as conspiracy theory.
[00:50:17.202 --> 00:50:21.643]  So they're going to try to launder this story to a more friendly or domesticated audience.
[00:50:22.023 --> 00:50:25.604]  Media source, because it's going to come out inevitably.
[00:50:25.684 --> 00:50:26.744]  Doc, we only have a few minutes left.
[00:50:26.784 --> 00:50:33.166]  I totally agree with you, but you don't like to speculate, but we know it's clearly an FBI training device.
[00:50:33.606 --> 00:50:38.728]  They clearly act like it's no big deal for a long time, then suddenly put on a kabuki theater for everybody.
[00:50:39.308 --> 00:50:40.748]  Harris covers up, she's in the building.
[00:50:41.128 --> 00:50:48.070]  Somehow she was going to be written into the narrative that somebody tried to go after her, but for some reason they decided not to go with that.
[00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:49.471]  So we're having to speculate now.
[00:50:51.211 --> 00:50:52.431]  But you say it's about to break.
[00:50:52.552 --> 00:50:53.832]  A, what is about to break?
[00:50:54.152 --> 00:50:58.533]  And then speculating or talking to a lot of smart people that you do, there's also a lot of whistleblowers.
[00:50:59.553 --> 00:51:00.913]  Do we know what the narrative was?
[00:51:03.074 --> 00:51:08.895]  Well, you know, truthfully, I am disinclined to speculate just because we're so close.
[00:51:09.055 --> 00:51:11.215]  I want to stick with what's rock solid.
[00:51:11.555 --> 00:51:15.196]  But I can say with absolute confidence, this was an op.
[00:51:16.541 --> 00:51:19.730]  They know that this has reached escape velocity.
[00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:22.678]  The thread that I did on this is like 11.5 million views.
[00:51:25.043 --> 00:51:28.805]  We did an interview with Tucker concurrently with that, with millions of views.
[00:51:29.025 --> 00:51:30.746]  This is an escape velocity.
[00:51:31.067 --> 00:51:41.952]  And this latest video is so damning that, you know, at the very least, they have to explain the flagrant violation of protocol for these Secret Service agents doing nothing while children walk by the bomb.
[00:51:42.533 --> 00:51:44.634]  And, you know, there has to be an explanation.
[00:51:44.654 --> 00:51:48.195]  Sure, what they're dreading is congressional hearings, just like Ray Epps became a major point.
[00:51:48.556 --> 00:51:50.417]  This is about to become the next point.
[00:51:50.737 --> 00:51:52.858]  I want to squeeze in one final point in there, because...
[00:51:53.291 --> 00:52:11.030]  The core strategy of their damage control is going to be to cordon off the pipe bomb story, which is going to be a huge scandal in its own right, but they're going to try to cordon that off to prevent it from metastasizing narratively into other dimensions January 6th.
[00:52:11.431 --> 00:52:14.034]  But they cannot do that because
[00:52:15.066 --> 00:52:23.492]  ...of the perfect synchronicity between the timing of the pipe bomb's discovery and that initial breach on the Capitol by the Peace Monument.
[00:52:24.053 --> 00:52:30.717]  When it's exposed that finally that the pipe bomb thing was an op, it will necessarily follow.
[00:52:30.757 --> 00:52:43.687]  The next domino necessarily is that that Peace Monument breach was a fed op in precisely the way that we described in our now classic piece called Meet Ray Epps Part 2.
[00:52:44.619 --> 00:52:47.800]  These are going to converge.
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:50.360]  We have a few minutes left.
[00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:51.880]  A few minutes left.
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:52.860]  When do you expect this?
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:54.081]  Because it's already been exploding.
[00:52:54.341 --> 00:52:56.221]  Again, no pun intended, but it is exploding.
[00:52:56.941 --> 00:52:58.761]  Obviously, Ray Epps, so much pressure.
[00:52:58.781 --> 00:52:59.522]  They have to charge him.
[00:52:59.562 --> 00:53:03.822]  Then no prison time when he's there coordinating way more than anybody else.
[00:53:03.902 --> 00:53:06.963]  And then people that did nothing get 20 years.
[00:53:07.783 --> 00:53:09.243]  He's there saying, I coordinated it.
[00:53:09.283 --> 00:53:11.704]  Go in, go in, go in, ramming signs into people.
[00:53:12.164 --> 00:53:14.024]  And he gets no jail time.
[00:53:15.842 --> 00:53:16.322]  Absolutely.
[00:53:16.382 --> 00:53:19.785]  I mean, they're desperately trying to tie up the loose ends there.
[00:53:19.865 --> 00:53:22.947]  And so, you know, when we see it, we say no jail time.
[00:53:22.987 --> 00:53:25.929]  They waited, you know, almost three years to charge him with anything.
[00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:29.572]  And whereas he was one of the first people put on the FBI's most wanted list.
[00:53:29.612 --> 00:53:38.759]  So they think the people are so dumb that even if they give him a misdemeanor charge, a phony misdemeanor wrist slap charge three years after his
[00:53:39.489 --> 00:53:42.592]  And you predicted when he got charged that it would be no time spent.
[00:54:00.342 --> 00:54:04.506]  Yeah, but even if there was time spent, it wouldn't change the fundamental analysis.
[00:54:04.787 --> 00:54:06.068]  What's out there is out there.
[00:54:06.368 --> 00:54:10.492]  So no matter what they have done, it's like they can't put the toothpaste back in the tube.
[00:54:10.933 --> 00:54:18.020]  The Ray Epps story is already out there, and there's no explanation for the full range of things that we've
[00:54:18.462 --> 00:54:22.185]  Put forth to the public for years now.
[00:54:22.345 --> 00:54:27.529]  A misdemeanor charge, even if they did give him six months, wouldn't have explained it.
[00:54:27.549 --> 00:54:28.430]  We've only got about a minute left.
[00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:29.271]  Thanks for the time.
[00:54:29.491 --> 00:54:30.972]  Revolver.News, amazing work.
[00:54:31.553 --> 00:54:33.454]  You've been just over the target for years.
[00:54:34.495 --> 00:54:36.497]  In 30, 40 seconds, what's the time frame?
[00:54:36.517 --> 00:54:37.457]  You obviously know a lot more.
[00:54:37.477 --> 00:54:38.278]  You're not staying on air.
[00:54:38.618 --> 00:54:40.180]  I've got some of the same intel coming in.
[00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:42.982]  Obviously, we shouldn't go too far.
[00:54:43.002 --> 00:54:44.823]  Just let it naturally come out.
[00:54:44.883 --> 00:54:46.285]  But they're definitely scared of this.
[00:54:46.645 --> 00:54:47.786]  What's the timetable here?
[00:54:49.451 --> 00:54:57.994]  Well, I couldn't say specifically, but I suspect this will all unravel in the coming couple months, maybe even sooner.
[00:54:59.414 --> 00:55:01.615]  What I've heard is there's whistleblowers about to come out.
[00:55:03.335 --> 00:55:17.260]  Well, you know, there are a lot of whistleblowers of different varieties, and some have accurate information, some don't, unfortunately, and sometimes that's malicious, sometimes it's just, you know, a well-intentioned mistake, and so I think it's
[00:55:17.805 --> 00:55:40.195]  Really important to severely vet any information coming out because, again, as part of the limited hangout, as part of the damage control strategy, oftentimes the government will give sort of fake or half-fake information to people or whistleblowers to serve to discredit the story when certain aspects are shown to be false.
[00:55:40.235 --> 00:55:41.836]  So we all need to be very careful.
[00:55:42.556 --> 00:55:47.738]  And severely evaluate and vet information coming out in the next couple months.
[00:55:48.098 --> 00:55:48.598]  I totally agree.
[00:55:48.638 --> 00:56:03.983]  But in summation, of all the different federal operations and operators, too many to count, they admitted in federal court, too many operators to count, while the FBI director tried to deny it, this is going to be cut and dry at the feds, trying to do some nasty stuff, and they're in a lot of trouble, and that's good.
[00:56:04.043 --> 00:56:05.223]  Dr. Beattie, thank you so much.
[00:56:06.121 --> 00:56:06.421]  Indeed.
[00:56:06.502 --> 00:56:06.922]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:56:06.942 --> 00:56:13.170]  All right, we're going to start the next hour and come back and get into the latest WF videos that are so insane.
[00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.911]  They're coming for your food.
[00:56:13.931 --> 00:56:14.873]  They're coming for your coffee.
[00:56:15.594 --> 00:56:18.397]  It's not just your gas-powered stoves and everything else.
[00:56:18.718 --> 00:56:20.320]  We're going to be hitting it all next hour.
[00:56:21.101 --> 00:56:22.302]  I'm going to be able to put the phones up.
[00:56:22.382 --> 00:56:26.404]  Michael Yan joins us from Panama with the most shocking information yet.
[00:56:26.424 --> 00:56:30.587]  They're building giant highways in, roads, bridges, huge UN camps.
[00:56:30.947 --> 00:56:38.152]  Remember, we're funded by you, so we try to bring you products that really work, that are great, so that when you order them, you see how great they are and reorder.
[00:56:38.612 --> 00:56:40.193]  Most people that buy our products reorder them.
[00:56:41.173 --> 00:56:44.876]  The problem is the majority of viewers and listeners never go to Infowarsstore.com
[00:56:45.816 --> 00:56:46.336]  I think it's great.
[00:57:10.276 --> 00:57:12.878]  Our great sponsor, drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:57:12.898 --> 00:57:16.020]  It's just one word, drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:28.189]  drjonesnaturals.com has all those great silver products that have not been available for so long at infowarsstore.com are now available exclusively at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:57:28.249 --> 00:57:31.292]  No space, just drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:57:31.992 --> 00:57:47.871]  More than 50 great products, many of them not available at InfoWarsStore.com, but it supports the broadcast as well, DrJonesNaturals.com, and they have the amazing Nano Silver Toothpaste, sold out for so long, back in stock, the original Super Blue Non-Fluoride Toothpaste.
[00:57:50.008 --> 00:57:54.290]  29 years on air, all I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalists.
[00:57:54.990 --> 00:58:00.312]  And I've done the best job I can to tell those words that have been accurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[00:58:00.712 --> 00:58:07.154]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves, unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people.
[00:58:07.394 --> 00:58:08.074]  We don't do that.
[00:58:08.534 --> 00:58:10.435]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[00:58:10.815 --> 00:58:12.816]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product.
[00:58:12.876 --> 00:58:13.456]  It's so powerful.
[00:58:14.376 --> 00:58:24.399]  This is the breakdown product after your cells process it of folic acid, methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[00:58:24.899 --> 00:58:26.139]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[00:58:26.159 --> 00:58:27.019]  It's not a stimulant.
[00:58:27.279 --> 00:58:32.181]  It energizes your cells and then everything else you take just supercharges it.
[00:58:32.221 --> 00:58:33.041]  It's so insane.
[00:58:33.381 --> 00:58:34.921]  It's foundational energy.
[00:58:35.362 --> 00:58:36.882]  The strongest formula out there.
[00:58:39.887 --> 00:58:43.934]  It doesn't just energize this operation against the tyrants, it energizes you.
[00:58:44.215 --> 00:58:45.617]  Get foundational energy now!
[00:58:50.706 --> 00:58:57.829]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large.
[00:58:58.390 --> 00:59:06.153]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep support formula, Down and Out, is just the thing.
[00:59:06.954 --> 00:59:13.317]  It's our new faster absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[00:59:13.957 --> 00:59:14.778]  We're good to go.
[00:59:33.154 --> 00:59:39.557]  Which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees, who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[00:59:39.778 --> 00:59:45.661]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep, because you will be down and out.
[00:59:45.961 --> 00:59:49.403]  Selling out now at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:59:51.524 --> 00:59:57.427]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:03.278 --> 01:00:08.152]  As leaders in government, business and society, we're good to go.
[01:00:09.418 --> 01:00:18.382]  A particular responsibility to rebuild trust in how we assume our own role as trustees.
[01:00:18.942 --> 01:00:33.569]  Hidden behind the lost attempt to rebuild trust for the Davos 2024 attendees' sugar-coated totalitarian strategy for world domination is a panicked roach nest of sociopaths
[01:00:33.889 --> 01:00:40.132]  Are you worried that if all the details come out about the Epstein trial, that your boss might...
[01:00:46.366 --> 01:00:50.487]  Get into legal trouble like Prince Andrew did or some of the others on the list.
[01:00:51.087 --> 01:00:55.268]  It must have been bad for Melinda to divorce him over Epstein.
[01:00:55.308 --> 01:00:58.949]  I mean, that's what Melinda Gates said, because he wouldn't stop visiting Epstein.
[01:00:59.330 --> 01:01:01.870]  He was evil personified.
[01:01:01.890 --> 01:01:03.931]  I had nightmares about it afterwards.
[01:01:03.951 --> 01:01:05.851]  I mean, how can you work for a guy like that?
[01:01:06.151 --> 01:01:11.893]  Treason, not trust, seemed to be the actual theme at this year's Davos.
[01:01:12.173 --> 01:01:14.774]  We are on the way to a new order, so we are between orders.
[01:01:15.914 --> 01:01:22.379]  What are we able to keep on the positive side from the old order to bring into a new world order?
[01:01:22.479 --> 01:01:29.043]  At the heart of it will be many of the core principles and core institutions of the existing order.
[01:01:29.404 --> 01:01:31.725]  It's absolutely critical that we accelerate.
[01:01:32.346 --> 01:01:38.230]  I don't want this, obviously, but if you wound up with a different president who was opposed to climate crisis, I got news for you.
[01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:42.313]  No one politician anywhere in the world can undo what is happening now.
[01:01:42.613 --> 01:01:43.974]  The marketplace is doing this.
[01:01:44.514 --> 01:01:56.463]  Many of these so-called righteous saviors of humanity chose to stick their nose up at the thought of addressing the peasants when confronted by journalists asking basic questions.
[01:01:56.643 --> 01:02:02.788]  I want to ask about McKinsey and those huge contracts you guys got from the Canadian government after meeting with Chrystia Freeland.
[01:02:03.268 --> 01:02:03.969]  Oh, don't run away!
[01:02:04.569 --> 01:02:05.109]  Don't run away.
[01:02:05.149 --> 01:02:08.010]  Why don't you want to talk about your contract with Canadian taxpayers?
[01:02:08.691 --> 01:02:11.132]  I mean, surely you believe in transparency.
[01:02:11.572 --> 01:02:13.132]  What are your plans going forward?
[01:02:13.152 --> 01:02:15.813]  Not going to talk about it right now, here.
[01:02:16.274 --> 01:02:18.775]  Are you pulling back from it the same way BlackRock is?
[01:02:19.875 --> 01:02:20.055]  No.
[01:02:20.495 --> 01:02:23.617]  And why don't we just set this up formally?
[01:02:23.637 --> 01:02:24.797]  But no, we're not pulling back from it.
[01:02:25.157 --> 01:02:27.578]  Are you worried about misinformation and disinformation?
[01:02:27.598 --> 01:02:31.199]  That's been a big focus of the World Economic Forum this year.
[01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:32.280]  Do you agree with that?
[01:02:33.681 --> 01:02:35.922]  You don't have enough credentials to go up there, apparently.
[01:02:36.782 --> 01:02:42.025]  But what about the forcible nature that so many people were forced to take the jab or lose their job?
[01:02:42.965 --> 01:02:50.568]  Well, what I'd like to actually just say within this is that we're certainly proud of the efforts that collectively that the health care sector made.
[01:02:50.588 --> 01:02:52.429]  Right, and I know that, and I'm not disputing that.
[01:02:52.569 --> 01:02:59.292]  I think that if you'd like to discuss any of this further, that you can certainly be in contact with our media relations group, and they'd be happy to get in touch with you on it, okay?
[01:02:59.432 --> 01:03:01.192]  I don't think they would be happy to get in touch with me.
[01:03:01.252 --> 01:03:08.415]  I'm asking you about the forcible nature, that if people didn't, if they weren't forced to take your medicine against their will, they'd be fired.
[01:03:08.695 --> 01:03:13.757]  I need to go on this, but what I would say is that all of this comes down to local decisions that are made by countries.
[01:03:13.817 --> 01:03:14.558]  Local decisions?
[01:03:14.858 --> 01:03:15.938]  I think you profited by it.
[01:03:17.899 --> 01:03:18.439]  How you doing?
[01:03:19.019 --> 01:03:27.442]  Do you think you did well in COVID and if you're going to do as well in disease X?
[01:03:27.582 --> 01:03:28.582]  What is disease X?
[01:03:29.503 --> 01:03:30.943]  Mr. Tedros, what is disease X?
[01:03:32.204 --> 01:03:34.104]  And when is China going to release it?
[01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:41.326]  The number one issue that Klaus Schwab says is the goal for the WEF is to combat misinformation and disinformation.
[01:03:41.667 --> 01:03:42.707]  Is that important to Meta?
[01:03:43.985 --> 01:03:44.866]  I'm heading to my booth.
[01:03:45.547 --> 01:03:46.448]  This is not an interview.
[01:03:46.629 --> 01:03:49.733]  How come Facebook is censoring the internet?
[01:03:50.053 --> 01:03:51.975]  Is it your plan to interfere with the 2024 election?
[01:03:53.903 --> 01:03:55.444]  Sorry, I'm not here to do this.
[01:03:55.624 --> 01:03:59.966]  The Davos attendees of 2024 need to calm the f*** down.
[01:04:00.286 --> 01:04:07.889]  The overselling of an imminent nightmare future is really pissing huge populations of Team Humanity off.
[01:04:08.389 --> 01:04:19.954]  What's to stop the hundreds of millions of us from holding a confab of our own aimed at arresting these proponents of a genocidal New World Order?
[01:04:20.174 --> 01:04:21.715]  53 years after the WEF was founded...
[01:04:22.555 --> 01:04:26.019]  They have 75 million children working in their supply chains.
[01:04:26.339 --> 01:04:33.026]  The problem is that many of these companies have business models that have actually increased misery, hunger, malnutrition and child labor.
[01:04:33.326 --> 01:04:39.472]  The kind of person who will come into the next conservative administration is going to be governed by one principle, and that is...
[01:04:40.481 --> 01:04:41.142]  John Bowne.
[01:05:00.057 --> 01:05:04.283]  The Second American Revolution is happening now right in front of you.
[01:05:04.603 --> 01:05:08.969]  And you're tuned in to InfoWars because you're either looking for the truth or you're already a patron.
[01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:17.280]  I'm asking you now to realize we are at the fulcrum, the crossroads in the fight for human destiny and human future.
[01:05:18.021 --> 01:05:18.782]  We're good to go.
[01:05:36.718 --> 01:05:37.939]  In our victory against these tyrants.
[01:05:38.219 --> 01:05:39.801]  But now is the time to make the decision.
[01:05:40.341 --> 01:05:45.125]  I know there's millions of forms of media out there and all this BS, and the globalists hope you get lost in all of it.
[01:05:45.506 --> 01:05:50.170]  But notice the globalists, the New World Order, are coming after us because they realize we've got their number.
[01:05:51.050 --> 01:05:51.831]  Think about it.
[01:05:51.851 --> 01:05:53.172]  InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:05:53.192 --> 01:05:56.635]  If you want to support the tip of the spear, that decision's up to you.
[01:05:56.955 --> 01:05:58.477]  Please support us now at InfoWars.com.
[01:06:04.713 --> 01:06:07.136]  We're good to go.
[01:06:07.176 --> 01:06:08.398]  We're good to go.
[01:06:21.513 --> 01:06:23.335]  All right, we are beating the globalists.
[01:06:23.375 --> 01:06:27.879]  That is a true statement because they can't carry out their operations if people understand they're the ones behind it.
[01:06:28.219 --> 01:06:34.805]  They're supposed to be the saviors, but they can't stop running their mouths how they're actually creating the crises because they think they're so stupid.
[01:06:35.913 --> 01:06:36.313]  We're good to go.
[01:06:36.333 --> 01:06:36.813]  We're good to go.
[01:07:03.188 --> 01:07:06.149]  We'll be having our coffee for the session, and you raised the coffee example.
[01:07:06.189 --> 01:07:08.950]  I'd love just to give you the chance to expand on that.
[01:07:09.831 --> 01:07:17.814]  Basically, the coffee that we all drink emits between 15 and 20 ton of CO2 per ton of coffee.
[01:07:18.574 --> 01:07:25.157]  So, we should all know that this is, every time we drink coffee, we are basically putting CO2 into the atmosphere.
[01:07:26.938 --> 01:07:32.660]  The other, and one other reason is because most of the coffee plantation, or most of the coffee is produced through monoculture,
[01:07:35.216 --> 01:07:37.857]  And monoculture is also affected by climate change.
[01:07:39.158 --> 01:07:43.440]  The quality of these nature assets is deteriorating quite rapidly.
[01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:49.643]  Alright, so it always continues.
[01:07:49.723 --> 01:07:51.323]  It's always the same story.
[01:07:51.383 --> 01:07:54.305]  Anything popular, anything that the people want,
[01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:56.061]  We're good to go.
[01:08:19.102 --> 01:08:19.502]  I think.
[01:08:19.562 --> 01:08:19.742]  I think.
[01:08:20.063 --> 01:08:20.263]  I think.
[01:08:37.574 --> 01:08:37.774]  Why?
[01:08:37.874 --> 01:08:40.295]  Because in order to open an account, you need to have an ID.
[01:08:40.675 --> 01:08:40.815]  Right.
[01:08:41.315 --> 01:08:51.637]  And I have to say that when I started this job, there were actually very little countries in Africa or Latin America that had one ubiquitous type of ID.
[01:08:51.757 --> 01:08:53.337]  And certainly that it was digital.
[01:08:53.897 --> 01:08:55.258]  And certainly that it was biometric.
[01:08:55.378 --> 01:09:01.499]  And now we've really worked with all our partners to actually help that being, I mean, to grow this.
[01:09:02.239 --> 01:09:08.782]  And the interesting part of it is that, you know, yes, it is very necessary for financial services, but not only.
[01:09:08.802 --> 01:09:11.703]  It's also good for school enrollment.
[01:09:11.723 --> 01:09:15.344]  It's also good for health, who actually got a vaccination or not.
[01:09:16.104 --> 01:09:19.666]  It's very good to get your subsidies, you know, from the government.
[01:09:20.326 --> 01:09:23.607]  So this has not only effect to the financial services.
[01:09:23.667 --> 01:09:24.908]  It's a very important issue.
[01:09:27.099 --> 01:09:28.600]  That's the key to run your entire life.
[01:09:29.061 --> 01:09:31.703]  Here's the head of the Saudi Arabian Central Bank.
[01:09:31.963 --> 01:09:32.924]  Here's what he had to say about it.
[01:09:34.886 --> 01:09:43.574]  There's no realistic solution to the climate transition that does not involve a globally coordinated system of carbon taxes.
[01:09:44.675 --> 01:09:46.597]  There's no realistic or fair solution...
[01:09:47.190 --> 01:09:50.571]  That does not involve a globally coordinated system of carbon tax.
[01:09:50.631 --> 01:09:55.332]  And Ngozi at the WTO is coordinating this with several other international organizations.
[01:09:55.932 --> 01:09:56.913]  It's still early days.
[01:09:57.353 --> 01:10:01.754]  There's a perception that it's unjust, it's unfair, it'll lead to inflation.
[01:10:02.554 --> 01:10:04.235]  In fact, quite the contrary.
[01:10:05.935 --> 01:10:12.677]  If we don't do this, the countries that will suffer most ultimately are the developing countries.
[01:10:12.877 --> 01:10:15.098]  They're going to be the worst affected by climate change.
[01:10:16.067 --> 01:10:20.790]  If we don't do this, it's ordinary vulnerable communities that will suffer the most.
[01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:37.440]  What we need is a system of carbon taxes coupled with subsidies for vulnerable households and a stream of funding for the developing world to allow their investments in mitigation and adaptation that allows them to keep growing.
[01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:39.101]  And that's a real opportunity.
[01:10:39.642 --> 01:10:43.184]  It's a fair solution and it's the only realistic solution.
[01:10:43.664 --> 01:10:45.065]  And we can't keep ducking it.
[01:10:46.158 --> 01:10:46.498]  We're good to go.
[01:11:11.104 --> 01:11:16.248]  If you go back really not that long ago, as I say, we owned the news.
[01:11:16.489 --> 01:11:19.852]  We were the gatekeepers, and we very much owned the facts as well.
[01:11:20.132 --> 01:11:23.615]  If it said it in the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, then that was a fact.
[01:11:24.355 --> 01:11:30.801]  Nowadays, people can go to all sorts of different sources for the news, and they're much more questioning about what we're saying.
[01:11:31.261 --> 01:11:31.381]  So...
[01:11:32.142 --> 01:11:32.663]  We're good to go.
[01:12:02.642 --> 01:12:03.904]  Now, I want to explain something here.
[01:12:04.324 --> 01:12:06.568]  And I know the listeners are smart, but I want this to really sink in.
[01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:13.778]  When they get the cashless society, central financial currencies in that they're rolling out now, there's major resistance.
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:17.063]  They already control 88% of the wealth in the world.
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:19.240]  We're good to go.
[01:12:48.971 --> 01:12:49.712]  We're good to go.
[01:13:12.406 --> 01:13:12.846]  We're good to go.
[01:13:35.728 --> 01:13:36.269]  We're good to go.
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:56.821]  We're good to go.
[01:13:56.841 --> 01:13:57.061]  I think?
[01:14:18.885 --> 01:14:23.529]  And again, if you just tuned in, the globalists admit, we're losing, everybody hates us, what do we do?
[01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:28.794]  And they say, well, war's coming and cyber attacks and all these crises.
[01:14:29.495 --> 01:14:33.639]  If they make things bad enough, they still think you'll forget that they're the ones behind it.
[01:14:33.799 --> 01:14:34.700]  That's never going to happen.
[01:14:35.694 --> 01:14:39.095]  There's no putting that genie back in the bottle.
[01:14:56.002 --> 01:14:56.762]  We're good to go.
[01:15:18.214 --> 01:15:21.337]  That doesn't mean they're going to go away, but it's a big deal.
[01:15:21.937 --> 01:15:26.141]  They've been in trouble for decades, but now they're admitting they're on their last legs.
[01:15:26.201 --> 01:15:27.062]  This is a big deal.
[01:15:28.063 --> 01:15:29.003]  What do you think comes next?
[01:15:29.424 --> 01:15:31.646]  How do they try to grab Victor from the jaws of defeat?
[01:15:32.861 --> 01:15:33.582]  Toll-free number, 877-789-2539.
[01:15:33.602 --> 01:15:33.682]  877-789-2539.
[01:15:33.722 --> 01:15:36.144]  First-time callers, long-time callers, agree, disagree?
[01:15:36.164 --> 01:15:39.728]  All we ask is you've got a clean phone line, tell us where you're calling from.
[01:15:39.748 --> 01:15:39.808]  877-789-2539.
[01:15:39.828 --> 01:15:40.809]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:15:40.829 --> 01:15:41.109]  877-789-Alex.
[01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:42.070]  Infowars.com.
[01:15:42.090 --> 01:15:42.491]  Newswars.com.
[01:15:42.511 --> 01:15:42.931]  Band.video.
[01:15:42.951 --> 01:15:43.472]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:58.314 --> 01:16:00.577]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[01:16:00.737 --> 01:16:01.097]  Thank you.
[01:16:01.277 --> 01:16:03.840]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:05.162]  I started taking that stuff.
[01:16:05.202 --> 01:16:08.265]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[01:16:08.285 --> 01:16:09.427]  When did you start taking it?
[01:16:09.707 --> 01:16:13.691]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure, and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[01:16:13.772 --> 01:16:13.992]  Mm-hmm.
[01:16:14.292 --> 01:16:17.013]  And I started eating a little better, but my blood pressure stayed high.
[01:16:17.033 --> 01:16:24.537]  And when I took the X2 iodine after about two or four weeks, I think my body was detoxified of a bunch of metals and stuff that my body was storing.
[01:16:24.657 --> 01:16:26.858]  And my blood pressure came down to the perfect level.
[01:16:27.238 --> 01:16:30.160]  And I tell people the only thing I did with X2 iodine
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:44.503]  And even though I do think all your other products are good, I recommend to anybody that they start with X2 iodine because it detoxifies your body and kind of kicks your natural DNA into full force.
[01:16:44.603 --> 01:16:48.084]  So in my life, I found X2 iodine the best.
[01:16:48.544 --> 01:16:51.964]  I tried other iodines and they didn't have the same effect.
[01:16:52.284 --> 01:16:54.585]  So X2 iodine, I really wanted to point that out.
[01:16:58.171 --> 01:16:59.792]  I'm not on Team NFL.
[01:17:00.072 --> 01:17:01.573]  I'm not on Team NBA.
[01:17:01.753 --> 01:17:02.714]  I'm not on Team Olympics.
[01:17:03.014 --> 01:17:06.456]  I'm not on Team Globalist or Wokeism in the New World Order.
[01:17:06.676 --> 01:17:16.942]  I'm on Team Humanity, ladies and gentlemen, that loves God and loves our families and loves humanity and knows that we're destined to do even more incredible things than we've already done together.
[01:17:17.082 --> 01:17:20.764]  And so, inspired by my conversation with Elon Musk recently...
[01:17:21.084 --> 01:17:21.224]  I think?
[01:17:38.203 --> 01:17:39.004]  We're good to go.
[01:17:58.154 --> 01:17:59.935]  Real death is shutting off the economy.
[01:18:00.135 --> 01:18:02.437]  The bureaucrats and the corporations control the economy.
[01:18:02.757 --> 01:18:06.239]  As they vertically integrate the economy and consolidate power, they murder people en masse.
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:14.885]  And Elon Musk has warned them that if you destroy civilization, you won't be able to have certain redoubts of it, certain city-states that still have it, the Hunger Games model.
[01:18:15.205 --> 01:18:16.506]  It will destroy the elite as well.
[01:18:16.766 --> 01:18:19.548]  And anybody that studies history and has common sense knows that.
[01:18:20.228 --> 01:18:25.213]  The wars that are going to come out of the starvation and the inflation are being blamed on global warming.
[01:18:25.433 --> 01:18:28.136]  The viruses that come out of the labs are being blamed on global warming.
[01:18:28.376 --> 01:18:31.820]  The third world hordes being organized by the UN to invade are being blamed on global warming.
[01:18:32.641 --> 01:18:34.342]  The mass starvation is blamed on the virus.
[01:18:35.804 --> 01:18:38.006]  And everywhere we're told it's going to get worse.
[01:18:38.126 --> 01:18:39.067]  Billions are coming.
[01:18:39.227 --> 01:18:41.549]  Al Gore and Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton
[01:18:42.458 --> 01:18:49.604]  And the Rothschilds and the Davos Group and Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and Evaldo Harari say billions are coming to Europe.
[01:18:49.824 --> 01:18:51.305]  A billion are coming to the U.S.
[01:18:51.765 --> 01:18:53.046]  because of climate change.
[01:18:53.587 --> 01:18:57.970]  No, because you cut their economy off because the IMF or World Bank controls the loans and ordered lockdowns.
[01:18:58.090 --> 01:19:04.855]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the globalist agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[01:19:06.216 --> 01:19:19.225]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections, masquerading as vaccines.
[01:19:19.386 --> 01:19:28.412]  It is so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives oblivious, and you realize ignorance is not bliss, it equals death.
[01:19:30.026 --> 01:19:50.462]  But people are starting to really understand how serious things are and that's a hard thing to do because to wake up to a disturbing reality and realize that we're in the middle of a giant biological weapons war against humanity and that there's mass sterilization that's already taking place and they're cutting off all the major energy sources is really hard to deal with, but it's the reality.
[01:19:51.023 --> 01:19:55.206]  Facing it is our only chance to turn this around because stuff's about to get really, really nasty.
[01:19:55.606 --> 01:19:56.247]  Infowars.com
[01:20:00.915 --> 01:20:02.576]  I'm a pioneer!

[01:20:28.194 --> 01:20:29.275]  Going through it fast!
[01:20:30.563 --> 01:20:31.784]  I like to fight, too!
[01:20:32.864 --> 01:20:33.605]  I like to eat!

[01:20:40.809 --> 01:20:42.110]  This is what we look like!
[01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:43.311]  This is what we act like!

[01:20:51.596 --> 01:20:53.397]  And humans are turning on everywhere!
[01:20:53.697 --> 01:20:55.718]  Get behind me, Satan!
[01:20:57.299 --> 01:20:58.420]  Down with the devil!
[01:20:59.690 --> 01:21:00.350]  This can't be.
[01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:02.351]  You're playing the wrong message.

[01:21:07.493 --> 01:21:22.738]  All right, we're going to your phone calls, interspersing with masses of news.
[01:21:22.758 --> 01:21:26.699]  The head of Michael Young joining us from the Darien Gap.
[01:21:27.850 --> 01:21:34.133]  On the border of South America going into Central America where the UN and the Chinese along with U.S.
[01:21:34.173 --> 01:21:41.136]  funding are building bridges, giant roads, you name it, and huge refugee camps to accelerate the invasion.
[01:21:42.457 --> 01:21:50.000]  But I like to go back sometimes and give you a blast from the past.
[01:21:51.401 --> 01:21:56.483]  Here's a video from a year and a half ago with the disgusting...
[01:21:59.212 --> 01:21:59.992]  We're good to go.
[01:22:00.012 --> 01:22:00.312]  I think?
[01:22:29.093 --> 01:22:29.513]  We're good to go.
[01:22:29.553 --> 01:22:29.914]  We're good to go.
[01:22:52.966 --> 01:22:57.789]  And his ancestors all over Europe, they're European royalty, not even British.
[01:22:59.110 --> 01:23:01.191]  King George I, the British line, was taken over.
[01:23:01.771 --> 01:23:05.573]  That itself was the Norman line from William the Conqueror, but it's a side issue.
[01:23:06.534 --> 01:23:11.977]  They did this all over Europe, keeping people on small pieces of land at starvation level to control them.
[01:23:13.378 --> 01:23:20.222]  And that's all they're doing is bringing back feudalism and smiling at us when they're not at Jeffrey Epstein's island raping children.
[01:23:21.380 --> 01:23:25.061]  Or his dad's not hanging out with Jimmy Savelle raping children.
[01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:27.321]  And I'm just sick of them.
[01:23:27.361 --> 01:23:28.282]  It's disgusting.
[01:23:28.742 --> 01:23:31.762]  It's sycophantic.
[01:23:32.243 --> 01:23:33.423]  It's out of control.
[01:23:33.443 --> 01:23:46.486]  And I've watched people I've known that have supposedly fought the globalists literally be invited by these people to go to parties with them, and they stop fighting the New World Order.
[01:23:47.583 --> 01:23:50.686]  I think they've arrived socially because they're hanging out with royalty.
[01:23:51.387 --> 01:23:59.135]  There's nothing more uncool than royalty, especially if you're an American, because we're the country that overthrew it and started stopping it and created a world trend.
[01:24:00.656 --> 01:24:02.298]  So, just truly sick.
[01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:08.384]  Here's a clip of this leering gargoyle telling you to take the poison shot.
[01:24:08.625 --> 01:24:09.766]  So now the blood's on his hands.
[01:24:10.558 --> 01:24:19.584]  Catherine and I are not medical experts by any means, but if it's any consolation, we can wholeheartedly support having vaccinations.
[01:24:19.765 --> 01:24:20.685]  It's really, really important.
[01:24:20.705 --> 01:24:25.529]  We've spoken to a lot of people about it, and the uptake's been amazing so far.
[01:24:25.549 --> 01:24:31.513]  We've got to keep it going so that the younger generations also feel that it's really important for them to have it.
[01:24:31.653 --> 01:24:49.810]  It must be really daunting, especially at the beginning, with the warnings out there for those with asthma and underlying health conditions and things like that, with the uncertainty of not knowing what it was about the pandemic that was going to be a threat or a complication.
[01:24:50.830 --> 01:24:54.091]  Social media is awash sometimes with lots of rumors and misinformation.
[01:24:54.112 --> 01:24:58.013]  So we have to be a little bit careful who we believe and where we get our information from.
[01:24:58.093 --> 01:25:03.895]  But especially for those who are clinically vulnerable as well, it's so important that those vaccinations are done.
[01:25:05.776 --> 01:25:08.857]  So we've got the Queen of the Netherlands out there saying the same crap.
[01:25:09.838 --> 01:25:12.279]  And she wants a cashless society to force you to take shots.
[01:25:12.319 --> 01:25:13.179]  They're up there saying it.
[01:25:14.957 --> 01:25:18.858]  And of course his grandfather, Prince Philip, said he wants to kill 80% of the world's population.
[01:25:18.878 --> 01:25:22.278]  Just search Prince Philip, destroy, kill 80% of the population.
[01:25:22.618 --> 01:25:23.899]  He gave a whole bunch of interviews.
[01:25:24.119 --> 01:25:26.279]  Autobahn Society, AP, Reuters.
[01:25:27.019 --> 01:25:27.999]  He wrote books about it.
[01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:35.801]  It just goes on and on and on and on and on.
[01:25:39.922 --> 01:25:40.762]  That's who we're up against.
[01:25:40.782 --> 01:25:42.222]  I see we've got loaded phone lines.
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:45.020]  And we're going to go to break here in a few minutes.
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.881]  When we come back, I'm going to go right to your calls.
[01:25:46.901 --> 01:25:50.362]  We'll skip that break coming up, so we'll have a whole 30 minutes to get to everybody on the board.
[01:25:50.382 --> 01:25:58.885]  I'm going to move quick through Cassandra and Hulkman and Jimmy and Sean and Michael and Angie and Bart, Curtis, Tanner, Malachi, and Arnold.
[01:25:58.925 --> 01:26:05.026]  That'll be the calls we take today ahead of Michael Young joining us from Southern Central America.
[01:26:05.046 --> 01:26:09.768]  You've got a real opportunity here to...
[01:26:11.499 --> 01:26:12.780]  We're good to go.
[01:26:34.266 --> 01:26:35.446]  If you don't, you're really missing out.
[01:27:00.871 --> 01:27:03.874]  Because you see our information is informative and cutting edge.
[01:27:04.434 --> 01:27:16.084]  Every product we've got, whether it's water filtration, gravity-fed stainless steel water filtration, portable or in your house, you name it, it's one of the highest rated systems out there at the lowest price.
[01:27:17.925 --> 01:27:18.206]  Boom.
[01:27:18.386 --> 01:27:19.647]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:27:20.107 --> 01:27:21.108]  The Alexa Pure system.
[01:27:22.149 --> 01:27:23.650]  And their air filtration is amazing as well.
[01:27:26.853 --> 01:27:28.875]  And then we've got the supplements.
[01:27:30.734 --> 01:27:33.615]  Right now we have a big special, the Supercharged Special, even though it's selling out.
[01:27:33.975 --> 01:27:36.776]  DNA Force Plus and Real Red Pill Plus that go together so good.
[01:27:37.076 --> 01:27:39.798]  Your telomeres, your DNA, your cell health, cleaning out your blood.
[01:27:40.418 --> 01:27:45.160]  That is 50% off when you get them together, 40% off individually.
[01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:47.140]  You're like, well, why are you discounting it if you're almost sold out?
[01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:48.281]  Because we need the funds now.
[01:27:50.462 --> 01:27:51.902]  So this is a win-win situation.
[01:27:51.922 --> 01:27:53.523]  The only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[01:27:53.583 --> 01:27:54.583]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:27:54.763 --> 01:27:56.704]  And I mentioned this earlier, but only for like 10 seconds.
[01:27:57.304 --> 01:27:58.405]  I really want you to listen to me.
[01:27:59.298 --> 01:27:59.919]  We're good to go.
[01:28:22.361 --> 01:28:29.139]  With the nano-silver patented, with the high-quality iodine, with the tea tree oil, with the peppermint pure...
[01:28:30.117 --> 01:28:31.638]  This is super strong toothpaste.
[01:28:32.218 --> 01:28:32.839]  You'll use this.
[01:28:32.879 --> 01:28:35.361]  You only need like a quarter of the amount of regular toothpaste.
[01:28:35.381 --> 01:28:36.241]  You're going to be blown away.
[01:28:36.281 --> 01:28:37.542]  People are so excited it's back.

[01:28:59.332 --> 01:29:07.555]  Cellular damage from a type of free radical known as reactive oxygen species can cause decreased cellular function.
[01:29:07.896 --> 01:29:14.758]  DNA Force Plus contains what are believed to be the most beneficial ingredients to remedy this.
[01:29:15.359 --> 01:29:19.160]  Now 40% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:23.642]  The main ingredient in the real red pill plus is pregnenolone.
[01:29:24.002 --> 01:29:27.863]  Which occurs naturally in our body, but decreases with age.
[01:29:28.343 --> 01:29:33.265]  Low levels of pregnenolone are associated with fatigue and low brain function.
[01:29:33.665 --> 01:29:41.628]  The real Red Pill Plus is also full of essential trace minerals to synergistically support optimal cognitive function.
[01:29:41.648 --> 01:29:42.868]  Now 40% off at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:30:03.601 --> 01:30:07.704]  They're planning to get rid of the borders and release a virus and have a global power grab.
[01:30:07.744 --> 01:30:08.785]  And you saw it all come true.
[01:30:09.906 --> 01:30:10.646]  But there's a...
[01:30:11.767 --> 01:30:12.548]  Inverse of that.
[01:30:13.288 --> 01:30:15.970]  There's not just the bad stuff I'm telling you about.
[01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:18.272]  There's the good stuff I'm telling you about.
[01:30:19.032 --> 01:30:23.696]  And just like our information is the best you're going to find out there, our supplements are amazing.

[01:32:07.714 --> 01:32:12.719]  Utilized for thousands of years, turmeric is one of the most studied medicinal herbs today.

[01:32:21.047 --> 01:32:25.091]  But our super powerful extract used in bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients in turmeric.

[01:33:10.717 --> 01:33:11.417]  Big Brother.
[01:33:11.877 --> 01:33:13.118]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:13.678 --> 01:33:15.559]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:15.579 --> 01:33:17.000]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:18.420]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:23.422]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:23.822 --> 01:33:25.323]  Let's get your motor running.
[01:33:27.043 --> 01:33:28.684]  Get it on the highway.
[01:33:30.345 --> 01:33:31.885]  Looking for adventure.
[01:33:33.346 --> 01:33:35.107]  And whatever comes our way.
[01:33:44.534 --> 01:33:45.475]  All right.
[01:33:45.495 --> 01:33:54.602]  I'm about to go right to your phone calls for the rest of the hour.
[01:33:54.642 --> 01:33:57.884]  Michael Young with massive, biggest news yet on the border.
[01:33:57.904 --> 01:33:59.105]  It just gets more insane.
[01:33:59.125 --> 01:34:01.267]  Because the world gets more insane every day.
[01:34:02.591 --> 01:34:03.151]  Alex Jones Show!
[01:34:03.171 --> 01:34:03.672]  We're good to go.
[01:34:31.172 --> 01:34:31.732]  We're good to go.
[01:34:32.513 --> 01:34:33.233]  We're good to go.
[01:34:57.432 --> 01:34:59.395]  So I'm still on a bunch of radio stations.
[01:34:59.415 --> 01:35:05.883]  So when they deplatformed me five years ago off of everything but InfoWars.com, we stayed on air barely.
[01:35:08.305 --> 01:35:33.924]  Because I sold my savings and everything I had as backup, wasn't that much, and we were on a lot of radio stations, and then we could tell people where to find us on those to spread the word, so the talk radio listeners told their friends and family around the country and the world, tune in to the Forbidden Show at InfoWars.com, so we got over a million people tuning in on the internet, at least a day there, and then people shared the clips to five or six million off of that.
[01:35:35.245 --> 01:35:36.526]  That's a conservative guesstimation.
[01:35:37.853 --> 01:35:38.293]  We're good to go.
[01:36:01.678 --> 01:36:07.519]  So, now we're back, thanks to X, conservatively reaching 10 million extra people a day.
[01:36:07.979 --> 01:36:11.500]  On top of the 5 million or so we reach over Infowars.com and radio stations.
[01:36:11.900 --> 01:36:13.560]  Those are very conservative numbers, all right?
[01:36:15.681 --> 01:36:16.861]  We're reaching about 20 million a day.
[01:36:18.441 --> 01:36:19.641]  And I see it everywhere.
[01:36:19.742 --> 01:36:20.822]  Man, why are there ads?
[01:36:20.922 --> 01:36:24.222]  Because I'm on the traditional media.
[01:36:25.043 --> 01:36:25.863]  This is a show.
[01:36:25.903 --> 01:36:27.143]  Now, what have I done?
[01:36:28.686 --> 01:36:31.528]  I've been skipping almost all the network breaks.
[01:36:33.429 --> 01:36:37.371]  And the network breaks are at 15 after and 45 after.
[01:36:38.111 --> 01:36:44.735]  All the other breaks at the middle of the hour and at the start of the hour, those are local stations.
[01:36:44.755 --> 01:36:47.476]  We're not getting rid of those because they've got to pay their bills.
[01:36:48.817 --> 01:36:52.039]  That's how they pay for the tower and their crew and their people.
[01:36:53.339 --> 01:36:56.261]  So I have basically phased out
[01:36:57.415 --> 01:36:57.915]  We're good to go.
[01:36:57.955 --> 01:36:58.656]  We're good to go.
[01:36:58.676 --> 01:36:59.036]  We're good to go.
[01:37:22.711 --> 01:37:23.051]  I don't know.
[01:37:49.158 --> 01:37:49.578]  We're good to go.
[01:37:49.618 --> 01:37:49.878]  I think?
[01:38:14.544 --> 01:38:16.085]  But it's been one hell of a fight.
[01:38:16.185 --> 01:38:23.890]  So, yeah, I do intend, and I've been doing some of it, to do commercial-free podcast.
[01:38:25.311 --> 01:38:32.015]  I'm just so busy running around trying to find money to fund this thing that I spent half my time trying to raise funds.
[01:38:33.075 --> 01:38:39.582]  So, I want to get in a position where there's plenty of money so I can do the special podcasts, the special interviews with no commercials.
[01:38:39.622 --> 01:38:40.523]  And I've been doing a lot of those.
[01:38:40.824 --> 01:38:41.424]  At least one a week.
[01:38:41.444 --> 01:38:42.746]  But I want to do them like five days a week.
[01:38:43.406 --> 01:38:43.987]  I'm trying.
[01:38:44.047 --> 01:38:45.188]  I'm trying to do the show with Crowder.
[01:38:45.208 --> 01:38:46.150]  I'm trying here, folks.
[01:38:46.770 --> 01:38:48.352]  And I've got more interviews than I can ever do.
[01:38:48.472 --> 01:38:50.534]  I'm busier than a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest.
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:52.941]  And I get pissed at myself sometimes.
[01:38:53.001 --> 01:38:58.503]  It's like 9 at night, an interview's set, and I've got to call the interviewer up and say, I know you're a big show.
[01:38:58.683 --> 01:38:59.503]  I can barely talk.
[01:38:59.663 --> 01:39:00.364]  I just can't do it.
[01:39:00.864 --> 01:39:01.864]  I used to have unlimited energy.
[01:39:01.944 --> 01:39:02.484]  I'm older now.
[01:39:03.645 --> 01:39:08.707]  That's why I look at Trump at 77, 78, and they'll show footage of him at 3 a.m.
[01:39:08.787 --> 01:39:09.287]  coming in.
[01:39:09.647 --> 01:39:12.328]  He sleeps two hours, and then they go, oh, look, he's dragging his feet.
[01:39:13.809 --> 01:39:16.510]  I told Roger Stone last night, we need to cut that out.
[01:39:17.347 --> 01:39:21.370]  I mean, when I was 25, 30 years old, I could work 18 hours a day for weeks on end.
[01:39:22.331 --> 01:39:23.652]  Trump's Superman, folks.
[01:39:23.672 --> 01:39:25.153]  Just because of that, my respect for him.
[01:39:25.354 --> 01:39:27.936]  So I've been watching his schedule.
[01:39:27.956 --> 01:39:28.696]  20-hour days?
[01:39:28.716 --> 01:39:32.759]  I mean, this is Conan the Barbarian stuff.
[01:39:33.020 --> 01:39:34.060]  This is Superman stuff.
[01:39:35.123 --> 01:39:36.844]  And it's not smart.
[01:39:37.445 --> 01:39:40.407]  Trump's biggest enemy is himself, and he needs to put the brakes on.
[01:39:40.887 --> 01:39:41.567]  And I've learned how.
[01:39:41.687 --> 01:39:50.673]  I have some interviews set up at midnight on some huge show, international show, and most of the time I just say, I'm not doing it because I just can't.
[01:39:50.693 --> 01:39:55.356]  I already didn't see my kids a lot.
[01:39:55.376 --> 01:39:56.197]  I've got four children.
[01:39:56.637 --> 01:39:59.519]  The last ten years, I was there quite a bit some when I could.
[01:39:59.539 --> 01:40:01.240]  I mean, quality time.
[01:40:01.260 --> 01:40:02.801]  But no, I wasn't there like I should have been.
[01:40:03.962 --> 01:40:04.082]  And...
[01:40:07.233 --> 01:40:11.074]  I got my six-and-a-half-year-old daughter, and I'm spending a lot of time with her because life's too short.
[01:40:11.795 --> 01:40:13.895]  But I'm pontificating.
[01:40:13.935 --> 01:40:14.695]  I said I'd take your calls.
[01:40:14.715 --> 01:40:16.136]  I'm sorry I'm going down a rabbit trail here.
[01:40:16.656 --> 01:40:19.237]  I'm just trying to explain to listeners how the cow ate the cabbage.
[01:40:19.577 --> 01:40:20.637]  All right, thank you for putting up with me.
[01:40:21.258 --> 01:40:22.858]  Let's go to Jimmy in North Carolina.
[01:40:22.898 --> 01:40:23.598]  Jimmy, you're on the air.
[01:40:23.638 --> 01:40:23.918]  Go ahead.
[01:40:23.959 --> 01:40:24.499]  Thanks for calling.
[01:40:25.519 --> 01:40:26.279]  Yeah, hey, Alex.
[01:40:26.559 --> 01:40:34.182]  I've been listening to you for a long, long time, and I find it interesting you guys published or posted today an article of Johns Hopkins about –
[01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:36.460]  You know, I actually meant to cover that.
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:37.861]  Hold on, let me just talk, and I'll let you go.
[01:40:37.881 --> 01:40:39.541]  Put him on hold, put him on hold, put him on hold.
[01:41:05.647 --> 01:41:06.708]  I'll let you talk here in a minute.
[01:41:07.488 --> 01:41:09.470]  That was in my stack, and I don't know where it is.
[01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:13.472]  Will you guys give me the John Hopkins article that's absolutely ridiculous?
[01:41:14.173 --> 01:41:17.835]  They say confiscating the guns will stop a revolution.
[01:41:18.456 --> 01:41:22.018]  Confiscating the guns will start a revolution, just like the one in 1776.
[01:41:22.639 --> 01:41:27.362]  So John Hopkins is one of the key brain trusts in the New World Order.
[01:41:27.702 --> 01:41:34.326]  They came out with a whole COVID lockdown plan with the Rockefeller Foundation, Operation Lockstep, all of it.
[01:41:35.727 --> 01:41:35.967]  Sorry.
[01:41:36.007 --> 01:41:36.668]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:41:38.128 --> 01:41:41.090]  I'm just saying that you're obeying one of the points on there perfectly.
[01:41:41.490 --> 01:41:43.111]  You're spreading hopium.
[01:41:43.151 --> 01:41:57.717]  That's your job is to give hopium to the people that this tyrannical communist death row system is going to give up and relent and that they're going to cede power just because we're going to politically resist and peacefully resist ourselves straight into a FEMA camp.
[01:41:58.097 --> 01:41:58.998]  So you're doing great.
[01:41:59.158 --> 01:42:01.799]  You're obeying the Hopkins document they released.
[01:42:02.239 --> 01:42:03.080]  Okay, all right.
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:04.181]  May I talk to you now?
[01:42:04.201 --> 01:42:05.342]  May I talk to you now?
[01:42:05.422 --> 01:42:08.304]  All right, put him on hold again.
[01:42:08.324 --> 01:42:09.545]  I want to have a conversation, Jimmy.
[01:42:09.565 --> 01:42:11.226]  I want to have a conversation.
[01:42:11.246 --> 01:42:15.329]  So I'm going to bring you back up live.
[01:42:15.349 --> 01:42:16.590]  May we have a conversation?
[01:42:31.926 --> 01:42:32.146]  Sure.
[01:42:32.646 --> 01:42:32.926]  Okay.
[01:42:34.767 --> 01:42:38.949]  Jimmy, are you going to go out and attack and kill some people today?
[01:42:39.590 --> 01:42:40.730]  Tell me who we're supposed to attack.
[01:42:41.470 --> 01:42:43.131]  You build a straw man there, buddy.
[01:42:44.272 --> 01:42:47.633]  Oh, I'm supposed to... Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[01:42:47.673 --> 01:42:48.334]  Put it back on hold.
[01:42:48.554 --> 01:42:49.094]  Put it back on hold.
[01:42:49.954 --> 01:42:55.157]  This John Hopkins document that I intended to cover that we put on InfoWars.com, here it is, is ridiculous.
[01:42:56.161 --> 01:43:02.654]  Trying to take the guns in 1776 at Lexington Concord is what triggered the Revolutionary War in 1775.
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:06.582]  And so this is preposterous.
[01:43:08.419 --> 01:43:14.283]  So you're saying I'm obeying John Hopkins because I don't want to go out and start a physical war.
[01:43:14.523 --> 01:43:16.485]  They had to provocateur January 6th.
[01:43:16.505 --> 01:43:19.467]  They had to stage Oklahoma City to demonize us as violent.
[01:43:19.687 --> 01:43:20.908]  We're winning hearts and minds.
[01:43:20.968 --> 01:43:21.908]  Trump's way ahead.
[01:43:22.489 --> 01:43:23.730]  The globalists are in trouble.
[01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:24.870]  They're being confronted everywhere.
[01:43:25.111 --> 01:43:26.051]  That's not hopium.
[01:43:27.132 --> 01:43:29.514]  Their ESG system is being defeated.
[01:43:30.322 --> 01:43:30.762]  We're good to go.
[01:43:30.782 --> 01:43:30.923]  I think?
[01:43:43.777 --> 01:43:50.999]  I was the first person to go out and protest all over the country against the lockdowns and not wear a mask and have preachers on that were getting arrested like Rodney Howard Brown.
[01:43:51.399 --> 01:43:52.919]  I said, don't let them take you to a camp.
[01:43:52.939 --> 01:43:55.260]  You have a right to defend yourself, which they're trying to set up.
[01:43:55.620 --> 01:43:59.521]  I am battling to cut the State Department funding of building the U.N.
[01:43:59.821 --> 01:44:00.721]  invasion camps.
[01:44:00.861 --> 01:44:04.762]  I'm going directly to the actual heart of things.
[01:44:06.703 --> 01:44:08.103]  If you're Alex Jones, what do you do?
[01:44:08.403 --> 01:44:09.504]  Teach me, Jimmy.
[01:44:09.804 --> 01:44:10.884]  Teach me what I'm supposed to do.
[01:44:15.797 --> 01:44:19.760]  I think, Alex, you've reached the end point of what your purpose has been.
[01:44:19.780 --> 01:44:23.222]  I don't think you're talking right on your telephone.
[01:44:23.262 --> 01:44:23.922]  Talk right into it.
[01:44:26.004 --> 01:44:29.226]  I think that your calling and your mission has run its course.
[01:44:31.707 --> 01:44:32.508]  Okay, I told you.
[01:44:32.548 --> 01:44:35.850]  Okay, so you're in command now, Jimmy.
[01:44:35.890 --> 01:44:36.410]  What do we do?
[01:44:37.251 --> 01:44:41.013]  You retire is what should happen.
[01:44:43.034 --> 01:44:43.855]  Good luck on that.
[01:44:46.241 --> 01:44:49.183]  I'm sure the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center, would be real happy, Jimmy.
[01:44:49.924 --> 01:44:51.265]  They're going to do what they're doing anyway.
[01:44:51.285 --> 01:44:52.406]  Nobody's stopping them, man.
[01:44:52.966 --> 01:44:54.327]  Trump's not going to stop anything.
[01:44:54.388 --> 01:44:56.309]  All of this is just a bunch of nonsense.
[01:44:57.650 --> 01:45:00.472]  Communism like this doesn't stop for anything.
[01:45:02.234 --> 01:45:05.997]  Well, look, you sound like Igor or whatever his name is from Winnie the Pooh.
[01:45:06.337 --> 01:45:07.057]  You guys know that.
[01:45:07.097 --> 01:45:08.258]  Communism doesn't stop.
[01:45:08.579 --> 01:45:12.061]  Is this Ray Epps calling in right now?
[01:45:12.722 --> 01:45:14.143]  See, there you go with your nonsense again.
[01:45:15.549 --> 01:45:15.829]  Right?
[01:45:16.289 --> 01:45:16.870]  I know.
[01:45:17.090 --> 01:45:20.891]  You call in saying, I'm not calling for offensive violence, so I'm bad.
[01:45:21.112 --> 01:45:24.133]  I'm calling out the fact that you speak from both sides of your mouth.
[01:45:24.293 --> 01:45:28.255]  You say that we're under assault, they're going to kill us all, they're killing our children, and they're doing all of these things.
[01:45:28.875 --> 01:45:33.257]  But you're saying that we're just going to vote for Trump, and that's our solution to everything.
[01:45:33.557 --> 01:45:34.638]  I appreciate your call.
[01:45:34.878 --> 01:45:35.618]  I appreciate your call.
[01:45:35.658 --> 01:45:36.879]  You're not listening to what I'm saying.
[01:45:37.611 --> 01:45:39.852]  I love all the guys in the comments on InfoWars.
[01:45:40.133 --> 01:45:42.474]  It's a minority of people, but Jones is a wimp.
[01:45:42.574 --> 01:45:43.815]  He needs to start killing people.
[01:45:44.295 --> 01:45:46.296]  Yeah, but you're not the one out there doing it.
[01:45:47.277 --> 01:45:48.958]  We have a good chance of beating this.
[01:45:49.578 --> 01:45:54.481]  I know almost all the other big talk show hosts are the dominant talk show hosts in the world, and they're against the globalists.
[01:45:55.282 --> 01:45:56.843]  And governments are turning our way.
[01:45:56.903 --> 01:45:57.944]  We're electing populists.
[01:45:58.184 --> 01:45:59.524]  Doesn't mean there's going to be some utopia.
[01:45:59.565 --> 01:46:01.366]  We're a decadent, evil species.
[01:46:01.746 --> 01:46:02.666]  We're also really good.
[01:46:02.947 --> 01:46:04.207]  We have both sides to it.
[01:46:05.148 --> 01:46:06.048]  And so...
[01:46:07.253 --> 01:46:11.635]  Man, I'm just trying to be a good, decent person here and say, don't take these shots.
[01:46:11.675 --> 01:46:12.536]  They can really hurt you.
[01:46:12.876 --> 01:46:14.237]  Here's the evidence day one.
[01:46:14.837 --> 01:46:29.645]  And I'm just here trying to fight the globalists and oppose their operations to secure our border and kick the pedophiles out of the public schools and kick the men out of women's sports and try to get the poisons out of our food and try to stop the 5G.
[01:46:29.665 --> 01:46:31.826]  And you just say, oh, that ain't going to do it.
[01:46:32.086 --> 01:46:33.426]  Nothing ever stops communism.
[01:46:33.607 --> 01:46:36.088]  We've stopped communism all over the world over and over again.
[01:46:37.554 --> 01:46:40.136]  I don't know if you watch the Davos group, but they're crapping their britches.
[01:46:41.077 --> 01:46:41.998]  And they're doing it for real.
[01:46:42.078 --> 01:46:44.280]  You don't believe in humanity.
[01:46:46.021 --> 01:46:50.145]  And you say that I, because I'm not, I mean, what is the target?
[01:46:51.406 --> 01:46:55.209]  If somebody shot Joe Biden or Barack Obama or Big Mike tomorrow, it'd make them stronger.
[01:46:55.670 --> 01:46:57.571]  We have to kill the ideas they promote.
[01:46:57.771 --> 01:47:00.454]  We have to annihilate their identity.
[01:47:02.585 --> 01:47:03.025]  We're good to go.
[01:47:33.131 --> 01:47:35.792]  And you can kill my body, but you can't kill my spirit, brother.
[01:47:36.492 --> 01:47:39.154]  And I'm coming for you.
[01:47:41.275 --> 01:47:43.476]  So that spirit in you wants me to go away.
[01:47:44.516 --> 01:47:46.917]  I'll work a few extra hours just for you today, Jimmy.
[01:47:48.558 --> 01:47:49.218]  What a joke.
[01:47:51.339 --> 01:47:53.420]  That guy isn't gonna do anything to anybody.
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:48:00.023]  He's gonna sit there and tell other men how they stumbled, how they couldn't measure up to Jimmy's level.
[01:48:01.189 --> 01:48:02.810]  I wish I was as tough as you, Jimmy.
[01:48:03.851 --> 01:48:05.552]  You know me, I'm just all talk.
[01:48:05.592 --> 01:48:06.673]  I'm not tough at all.
[01:48:09.155 --> 01:48:13.558]  I love it when people like that call.
[01:48:13.578 --> 01:48:14.799]  You just woke me up, son.
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:17.061]  Angie in Indiana, you're on the air.
[01:48:17.121 --> 01:48:17.461]  Welcome.
[01:48:17.501 --> 01:48:17.961]  Go ahead.
[01:48:20.263 --> 01:48:24.947]  I think what you had there was one of the patriot front pussies on your call there.
[01:48:25.027 --> 01:48:25.927]  That's what I was thinking.
[01:48:26.508 --> 01:48:28.089]  That's what I was thinking, too.
[01:48:28.129 --> 01:48:29.450]  He needs some alpha power.
[01:48:30.066 --> 01:48:32.073]  I mean, it's guys like him that are ruining this country.
[01:48:36.658 --> 01:48:37.558]  I think he was a fag.
[01:48:38.098 --> 01:48:38.799]  You think so?
[01:48:38.959 --> 01:48:41.419]  Alex Jones should stop exposing their whole agenda?
[01:48:42.039 --> 01:48:47.481]  We're going to block every damn... We've got laws being passed everywhere blocking bugs in the food.
[01:48:47.801 --> 01:48:48.901]  Italy's passing laws.
[01:48:49.121 --> 01:48:51.742]  We're going to block every damn bit of their agenda.
[01:48:51.922 --> 01:48:53.082]  We're starting to win.
[01:48:53.303 --> 01:48:57.344]  It's like we've been stuck in the mud and now our tires, we're almost out.
[01:48:57.764 --> 01:48:58.984]  And now we're coming out of the mud.
[01:48:59.004 --> 01:49:00.925]  He's like, wait, wait, turn your engine off.
[01:49:01.145 --> 01:49:01.885]  You're losing.
[01:49:01.965 --> 01:49:03.745]  No, we're getting out of the mud.
[01:49:03.945 --> 01:49:05.066]  We're getting out of the ditch.
[01:49:05.086 --> 01:49:05.846]  Can't you see it?
[01:49:06.986 --> 01:49:08.027]  I can see it, Alex.
[01:49:08.167 --> 01:49:08.827]  I can see it.
[01:49:09.668 --> 01:49:10.108]  Keep going.
[01:49:10.128 --> 01:49:10.869]  Sorry, I'm ranting.
[01:49:11.589 --> 01:49:12.530]  No, no, you're fine.
[01:49:12.550 --> 01:49:13.050]  You're fine.
[01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:19.475]  I want to talk about the Anne Heche, the Helena Hutchins, Anthony Weiner laptop videos.
[01:49:19.575 --> 01:49:22.577]  And I want to know, is that a real video?
[01:49:23.177 --> 01:49:23.978]  Is that real?
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:28.981]  I've seen that, and some of it's real.
[01:49:29.261 --> 01:49:30.242]  I'm not sure about the rest.
[01:49:30.262 --> 01:49:34.105]  But, yeah, Weiner was a whole other operation with Chuckie Schumer.
[01:49:35.539 --> 01:49:43.288]  It's all one club.
[01:49:44.309 --> 01:49:45.170]  It's all one club.
[01:49:45.430 --> 01:49:51.577]  I mean, Alec Baldwin, he's been indicted for shooting a lady that was going to make a documentary on human trafficking.
[01:49:52.105 --> 01:49:52.905]  Along with Anne Hayes.
[01:49:52.985 --> 01:49:56.906]  I mean, look, I remember that state senator, I forget her name, from like South Carolina or whatever.
[01:49:57.326 --> 01:49:58.567]  I had her on like 10 years ago.
[01:49:58.887 --> 01:50:01.788]  She came on and said, next week I'm breaking with child trafficking in the state.
[01:50:01.828 --> 01:50:03.328]  They killed her and her husband the next day.
[01:50:03.348 --> 01:50:04.328]  I remember like two days later.
[01:50:05.069 --> 01:50:06.349]  So here's the good news.
[01:50:06.789 --> 01:50:09.030]  They used to kill people because they didn't want this to get out.
[01:50:09.190 --> 01:50:09.830]  It's out now.
[01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:11.810]  Oh, but we're losing.
[01:50:12.051 --> 01:50:13.511]  We need to give up, Angie.
[01:50:15.163 --> 01:50:15.584]  Yeah, no.
[01:50:15.924 --> 01:50:16.825]  We ain't going to give up.
[01:50:16.865 --> 01:50:17.726]  We're going to push harder.
[01:50:17.746 --> 01:50:20.709]  We're going to buy alpha power, and we're going to take them down.
[01:50:20.909 --> 01:50:21.910]  You know who that guy was?
[01:50:21.950 --> 01:50:27.836]  He probably was a Fed front guy, but what he really is is Tokyo Rose from World War II.
[01:50:28.376 --> 01:50:35.584]  Even as we were dropping atomic bombs on Japan, she was on the radio telling our ships on AM and shortwave radio that we'd lost.
[01:50:37.168 --> 01:50:43.590]  Well, the good news about guys like him, they can't reproduce because they don't like women, and they can't reproduce.
[01:50:43.970 --> 01:50:45.511]  I do think that's obvious.
[01:50:45.571 --> 01:50:58.295]  I was going to say, the big thing I pick up from Patriot Front, which came out of the Charlottesville thing in 2017, and I remember having the guys on, and we looked up the head of the group, the previous group, and I go, you worked for Obama three years ago.
[01:50:58.315 --> 01:50:58.735]  Yeah, I did.
[01:50:58.775 --> 01:50:59.556]  You were a Democrat one year.
[01:50:59.576 --> 01:51:00.556]  He goes, well, now I'm not.
[01:51:00.856 --> 01:51:03.097]  And it's literally gay fat dudes.
[01:51:03.857 --> 01:51:05.718]  I mean, exactly.
[01:51:05.758 --> 01:51:10.660]  It's like a bunch of gay dudes that dress up and pose as patriots to make us look bad.
[01:51:11.561 --> 01:51:12.141]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:51:12.361 --> 01:51:13.662]  It's just like the old shakers.
[01:51:13.682 --> 01:51:16.343]  They're going to depopulate themselves.
[01:51:17.674 --> 01:51:22.697]  Well, what it is, is they're all in their uniforms, their outfits, and they got some mentally ill people.
[01:51:22.717 --> 01:51:25.719]  What it is, is that they're trying to find McVeigh Patsies in the group.
[01:51:26.399 --> 01:51:27.960]  What it is, is a giant psy-op.
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:29.881]  They're trying to find Patsies in the group.
[01:51:30.561 --> 01:51:33.703]  And the whole thing, I take one look at it, is federal and CIA.
[01:51:34.063 --> 01:51:35.484]  In fact, I'm not saying the FBI runs it.
[01:51:35.544 --> 01:51:36.425]  I say it's CIA.
[01:51:36.945 --> 01:51:38.046]  Completely stinks of it.
[01:51:38.306 --> 01:51:39.407]  Thank you so much, Angie.
[01:51:39.427 --> 01:51:39.907]  Great point.
[01:51:40.147 --> 01:51:41.348]  Yeah, I was going to say they look like...
[01:51:44.059 --> 01:51:44.579]  Fed front.
[01:51:44.859 --> 01:51:46.120]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:51:46.380 --> 01:51:48.800]  It's just like, give up, go off the air.
[01:51:49.021 --> 01:51:49.501]  Yeah.
[01:51:50.341 --> 01:51:50.581]  Yeah.
[01:51:51.001 --> 01:51:55.983]  When we've been proven right, we're winning it on every front, and all I get is high fives at the grocery store.
[01:51:56.623 --> 01:51:56.823]  Yeah.
[01:51:57.003 --> 01:51:57.983]  Hey, Tokyo Rose.
[01:51:58.983 --> 01:51:59.904]  I'm the Enola Gay.
[01:52:00.184 --> 01:52:00.744]  Meet this.
[01:52:01.004 --> 01:52:01.864]  Meet Fat Boy.
[01:52:04.485 --> 01:52:05.605]  Fat Man and Little Boy.
[01:52:05.706 --> 01:52:06.186]  Meet, meet.
[01:52:06.586 --> 01:52:07.066]  Yeah.
[01:52:07.446 --> 01:52:07.846]  Give up.
[01:52:07.906 --> 01:52:08.106]  Here.
[01:52:08.286 --> 01:52:09.107]  Here, Tokyo Rose.
[01:52:09.307 --> 01:52:10.827]  Here's a couple of atomic bombs.
[01:52:10.847 --> 01:52:13.788]  That's how I'm going to give up.
[01:52:15.686 --> 01:52:16.946]  I'm sorry for the Japanese, too.
[01:52:17.026 --> 01:52:20.988]  I think we went too far with dropping bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[01:52:21.008 --> 01:52:22.248]  But she was on the radio.
[01:52:22.268 --> 01:52:22.868]  It's on record.
[01:52:23.008 --> 01:52:23.609]  You're losing!
[01:52:23.629 --> 01:52:24.569]  You're losing, Americans!
[01:52:24.629 --> 01:52:25.549]  Roll over and die!
[01:52:25.589 --> 01:52:26.490]  It's all over for you!
[01:52:26.670 --> 01:52:27.210]  You're losing!
[01:52:27.230 --> 01:52:27.730]  You're losing!
[01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:28.410]  Give up now!
[01:52:30.871 --> 01:52:31.271]  I'm sorry.
[01:52:31.311 --> 01:52:32.052]  It's ridiculous.
[01:52:32.452 --> 01:52:34.372]  It's like Baghdad bomb in 2003.
[01:52:36.453 --> 01:52:38.594]  And there's like F-16s dropping bombs all behind.
[01:52:38.754 --> 01:52:41.275]  It's like, there are no Americans in Iraq.
[01:52:41.715 --> 01:52:43.235]  They've been driven into the ocean.
[01:52:43.856 --> 01:52:45.036]  We have destroyed them all.
[01:52:47.761 --> 01:52:49.482]  Oh, that Jimmy was Tokyo Rose.
[01:52:49.903 --> 01:52:51.664]  Hey, Michael and Mash, you're on the air.
[01:52:51.704 --> 01:52:52.004]  Go ahead.
[01:52:52.024 --> 01:52:52.565]  Thanks for holding.
[01:52:53.645 --> 01:52:54.326]  Hey, thank you.
[01:52:55.086 --> 01:52:55.987]  I got two questions.
[01:52:56.227 --> 01:53:04.753]  One, do you agree with Millay, what he said at the World Economic Forum?
[01:53:05.073 --> 01:53:06.814]  And two, I agree with the last caller.
[01:53:07.615 --> 01:53:09.556]  Patriot Front is probably a bunch of virgins.
[01:53:10.917 --> 01:53:12.518]  Well, they're not virgins.
[01:53:12.538 --> 01:53:15.580]  They've all been having sex together, obviously, but that's my opinion.
[01:53:17.227 --> 01:53:19.569]  Well, I've taken one look at him when they did that staged arrest thing.
[01:53:19.849 --> 01:53:27.135]  But seriously, and my gaydar is not that good, but, you know, when it's super obvious, like Liberace, it was obvious.
[01:53:28.356 --> 01:53:31.258]  But I saw a transcript of his speech.
[01:53:31.699 --> 01:53:34.180]  What particular parts did you mean?
[01:53:34.881 --> 01:53:36.142]  He calls out collectivism.
[01:53:36.162 --> 01:53:37.043]  He says the elite.
[01:53:38.124 --> 01:53:39.184]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[01:53:39.305 --> 01:53:43.968]  So the majority of what he said was on point, like almost all of it.
[01:53:44.329 --> 01:53:44.749]  It was good.
[01:53:45.658 --> 01:53:51.622]  And I guarantee that's going to get Zoomers panicking because they're not going to understand what he's talking about until it hits them.
[01:53:51.642 --> 01:53:54.043]  Oh, yeah, I mean, I only saw transcripts and a few clips.
[01:53:54.403 --> 01:53:55.604]  I'll be honest, I didn't watch the whole thing.
[01:53:55.624 --> 01:53:57.205]  They gave a bunch of other interviews, too.
[01:53:57.745 --> 01:53:59.507]  But I noticed people went, why is he there?
[01:53:59.587 --> 01:54:00.407]  He's a traitor.
[01:54:00.807 --> 01:54:03.209]  He was laughing at Klaus Schwab when he introduced him.
[01:54:03.489 --> 01:54:11.514]  And they got right up there and said the elites are the problem, you consolidated power, and you're full of crap and your carbon taxes are BS.
[01:54:11.754 --> 01:54:12.614]  I mean, I saw that much.
[01:54:12.634 --> 01:54:13.335]  I thought it was beautiful.
[01:54:14.201 --> 01:54:15.783]  I got a third secret question.
[01:54:15.883 --> 01:54:23.153]  Now, do you think that's going to be a common thing now where they're just going to start hitting them with these fucked up questions that they're not going to be able to answer?
[01:54:24.762 --> 01:54:27.725]  Yeah, I mean, it wasn't just Millie.
[01:54:28.126 --> 01:54:31.549]  It was like, people got up and got in their face.
[01:54:31.609 --> 01:54:32.710]  A whole bunch of people did.
[01:54:33.331 --> 01:54:37.675]  And again, even the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Politico said, we're losing.
[01:54:37.735 --> 01:54:38.416]  Everyone hates us.
[01:54:38.496 --> 01:54:39.637]  Oh, God, what do we do?
[01:54:39.997 --> 01:54:41.119]  They don't trust us anymore.
[01:54:41.179 --> 01:54:43.701]  They don't want to eat bugs.
[01:54:44.162 --> 01:54:46.924]  And then Alexander Soros got up and was like stuttering, going...
[01:54:47.645 --> 01:54:51.627]  We have to... Democracy... Trump wants to hurt democracy.
[01:54:51.867 --> 01:54:57.210]  That's why we have to like... So what if people... I mean... Sorry if they're mad.
[01:54:57.450 --> 01:54:59.191]  I mean, we are helping minorities.
[01:55:00.852 --> 01:55:06.816]  Women... I mean... Have you seen the clip of him?
[01:55:08.396 --> 01:55:10.978]  It was so... Yo, no shot.
[01:55:11.318 --> 01:55:12.919]  These motherfuckers were stuttering.
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:15.160]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:16.241]  Your phone's distorting a bit.
[01:55:17.298 --> 01:55:20.161]  The only thing I discriminate against in my math class caller is bad phones.
[01:55:21.042 --> 01:55:36.841]  By the way, I would have had that guy on Attack Me for an hour, because it's very entertaining, it's very informative, but it's just repetitive how they just have talking points, and he's reading off a script, probably in his Patriot Front outfit on.
[01:55:39.762 --> 01:55:42.184]  Oh, those guys are so being set up, including their leader.
[01:55:42.965 --> 01:55:44.326]  I already can see the whole operation.
[01:55:44.946 --> 01:55:47.208]  I can see for miles and miles and miles.
[01:55:47.648 --> 01:55:49.830]  Since I mentioned it, we'll come back and take a few more of your calls.
[01:55:50.210 --> 01:55:51.631]  Jan's coming on, but I'm going to get to everybody.
[01:55:51.651 --> 01:55:52.252]  I love you.
[01:55:52.292 --> 01:55:53.693]  We're going to get to everybody.
[01:55:56.015 --> 01:55:57.196]  This is Alexander Soros.
[01:55:57.676 --> 01:55:58.737]  Listen to this guy.
[01:55:58.797 --> 01:56:01.779]  This is one of the top generals of the New World Order.
[01:56:02.019 --> 01:56:03.240]  This makes me sleep good at night.
[01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:03.881]  Listen to this.
[01:56:05.066 --> 01:56:17.351]  To actually create a narrative that inspires people to vote and to believe in democracy and democratic institutions.
[01:56:17.431 --> 01:56:25.374]  On the institutional part, I think that we can talk about institutions as these abstract things, but institutions are also about people.
[01:56:26.134 --> 01:56:33.077]  And, you know, we just heard this point about untrustworthy people, and we talked about things in the United States like, you know,
[01:56:33.633 --> 01:56:37.058]  Like checks and balances which aren't written anywhere but are customs.
[01:56:37.659 --> 01:56:38.279]  And one man...
[01:56:39.091 --> 01:56:43.673]  Donald Trump literally came in and just took that all away.
[01:56:48.435 --> 01:57:06.841]  But when I see this, when I look at this more globally regarding democracy, I also say to myself, when was this great time that everybody got along so well and things were going so great?
[01:57:06.901 --> 01:57:07.402]  I mean, I think...
[01:57:13.123 --> 01:57:36.910]  I think that we really have to be careful here in this nostalgia for a time past because a lot of the reactions we're seeing in society are actually reactions to positive things like equality for women and greater diversity, which come with backlash.
[01:57:37.210 --> 01:57:38.271]  So it's like, everybody hates us.
[01:57:38.291 --> 01:57:39.012]  What's wrong with that?
[01:57:39.913 --> 01:57:43.197]  That's our enemy, a gibbering moron with $37 million.
[01:57:43.237 --> 01:57:44.819]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:44.839 --> 01:57:45.280]  Stay with us.
[01:57:48.786 --> 01:57:56.969]  Cellular damage from a type of free radical known as reactive oxygen species can cause decreased cellular function.
[01:57:57.330 --> 01:58:04.192]  DNA Force Plus contains what are believed to be the most beneficial ingredients to remedy this.

[01:58:48.629 --> 01:58:54.532]  We started producing over two years ago with a top independent video game maker, New World Wars.
[01:58:55.392 --> 01:58:56.513]  And it got behind.
[01:58:56.573 --> 01:58:57.714]  We added a lot of stuff to it.
[01:58:57.734 --> 01:58:58.414]  We updated it.
[01:58:58.554 --> 01:58:59.374]  It's already a hit game.
[01:58:59.394 --> 01:58:59.955]  People love it.

[01:59:04.657 --> 01:59:06.378]  The number one online video game platform.
[01:59:06.618 --> 01:59:07.318]  It's an incredible game.
[01:59:07.338 --> 01:59:07.899]  People love it.
[01:59:08.079 --> 01:59:10.320]  It's got a voiceover I did for it.
[01:59:10.380 --> 01:59:11.521]  It's amazing.

[02:00:13.158 --> 02:00:14.679]  Sean calling from the Republic.
[02:00:14.719 --> 02:00:15.800]  You're on the air, Sean.
[02:00:15.880 --> 02:00:18.642]  Welcome on January 6th and the pipe bomb.
[02:00:18.682 --> 02:00:19.103]  Go ahead.
[02:00:20.484 --> 02:00:25.007]  Yeah, Emmett Sullivan Jr., Emmett's friend, and the FBI.
[02:00:25.047 --> 02:00:27.229]  You want to know who was responsible for the pipe bomb?
[02:00:27.649 --> 02:00:28.130]  There you go.
[02:00:30.120 --> 02:00:33.522]  Okay, I'm not saying I was ignoring you, but I missed the name.
[02:00:34.803 --> 02:00:35.363]  You said who?
[02:00:36.123 --> 02:00:39.445]  Emmett Sullivan Jr., his friend, and the FBI.
[02:00:39.525 --> 02:00:40.446]  There you go, Darren Beattie.
[02:00:42.667 --> 02:00:44.548]  Who is Emmett Sullivan Jr.?
[02:00:45.629 --> 02:00:51.052]  I'm glad you actually asked that, Alex, because his dad is somebody who we should all be interested in looking up.
[02:00:51.512 --> 02:00:53.893]  He's a high-profile, high-ranking D.C.
[02:00:53.913 --> 02:00:55.054]  swamp creature judge.
[02:00:55.754 --> 02:00:58.216]  Pretty sure that dude's been in his position for probably 10, 20 years.
[02:00:59.915 --> 02:01:04.957]  Well, we don't screen calls here for content, and I'm being honest with you, I've heard that name before.
[02:01:04.977 --> 02:01:06.857]  Who has Emmett Sullivan Jr.
[02:01:06.877 --> 02:01:07.058]  known as?
[02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:26.763]  I don't know, but I'm pretty sure his brothers are Jaden X and the other one.
[02:01:26.823 --> 02:01:30.266]  It wasn't Jaden X, the one that was in the J6, in the building.
[02:01:30.286 --> 02:01:39.353]  Yeah, that's who I remember that name associated with is Jaden X, who bragged on video as he goes in with a girl connected to the Central Intelligence Agency.
[02:01:39.854 --> 02:01:41.275]  He goes, I told you this was going to happen.
[02:01:41.375 --> 02:01:41.615]  See?
[02:01:41.635 --> 02:01:44.418]  And, yeah.
[02:01:44.818 --> 02:01:45.519]  Well, I don't...
[02:01:47.014 --> 02:01:50.636]  So, sir, let me ask this, and I'm not saying you're credible, because, I mean, I don't know.
[02:01:50.656 --> 02:01:51.576]  You're just a caller called in.
[02:01:51.956 --> 02:01:53.297]  I'm just asking questions here.
[02:01:53.317 --> 02:01:56.758]  I mean, would you like us to put you on hold?
[02:01:56.778 --> 02:01:58.479]  Would you like to talk to someone?
[02:01:58.539 --> 02:02:03.301]  Actually, Alex, you put me on hold to talk to your crew about this over a year ago.
[02:02:03.321 --> 02:02:05.722]  I vaguely remember that.
[02:02:05.742 --> 02:02:07.483]  Well, we're not that big.
[02:02:08.683 --> 02:02:09.564]  Here, let me ask this question.
[02:02:09.584 --> 02:02:10.924]  You're on air right now.
[02:02:10.964 --> 02:02:12.365]  If you're saying this is true, how do you know this?
[02:02:13.808 --> 02:02:17.191]  Well, anybody who knows John McGreevy knows he spoke the truth.
[02:02:17.372 --> 02:02:18.673]  You can kill John McGreevy.
[02:02:18.953 --> 02:02:22.616]  You can try to do a wrap-up smear on John McGreevy at the end of his life.
[02:02:22.997 --> 02:02:25.939]  It was a bogus wrap-up smear, but you can't kill the message.
[02:02:26.219 --> 02:02:28.081]  John McGreevy told the truth, Alex.
[02:02:28.421 --> 02:02:29.923]  John McGreevy is a whistleblower.
[02:02:30.443 --> 02:02:32.385]  He's a God-fearing patriot whistleblower.
[02:02:32.425 --> 02:02:33.065]  He told the truth.
[02:02:33.165 --> 02:02:39.391]  Anybody out there listening right now that wants to hear more about this or know who John McGreevy is, look him up.
[02:02:39.491 --> 02:02:40.432]  J-O-N McGreevy.
[02:02:41.235 --> 02:02:43.497]  And his handle was JohnHereToHelp.
[02:02:43.897 --> 02:02:44.578]  He told the truth.
[02:02:45.339 --> 02:02:46.359]  I don't remember this stuff.
[02:02:46.380 --> 02:02:47.200]  I remember you vaguely.
[02:02:47.761 --> 02:02:48.762]  Who was John McGreevy?
[02:02:49.702 --> 02:02:50.543]  John McGreevy.
[02:02:50.683 --> 02:02:56.008]  Well, actually, you should know, Alex, because you actually hosted an interview that Stu Peters did with John McGreevy.
[02:02:56.748 --> 02:02:57.929]  I think they just put it on screen.
[02:02:57.949 --> 02:02:59.110]  So you're saying that guy's dead?
[02:03:00.512 --> 02:03:03.054]  I'm pretty sure they killed him because they were trying to kill him for a long time.
[02:03:03.094 --> 02:03:05.556]  But my point is, you can kill the messenger.
[02:03:05.716 --> 02:03:07.678]  You cannot kill the message.
[02:03:08.638 --> 02:03:14.999]  John McGreevy deserves to be remembered as a patriot, as a whistleblower, and as a national treasure.
[02:03:15.119 --> 02:03:17.340]  Okay, but first you said he's dead, and now you're not sure.
[02:03:17.380 --> 02:03:18.340]  I'm being honest with you.
[02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:19.520]  I remember your call vaguely.
[02:03:19.780 --> 02:03:31.443]  This is all Greek to me, and I'm just trying to figure out... They killed John McGreevy, and they did a wrap-up smear on him at the end of his life using the Harford County Sheriff's Department.
[02:03:31.743 --> 02:03:37.784]  They threatened John's wife if he didn't sign a pre-written quote-unquote admission of guilt.
[02:03:38.464 --> 02:03:40.205]  So, they persecuted him.
[02:03:40.525 --> 02:03:41.185]  They killed him.
[02:03:41.466 --> 02:03:43.026]  They did a riot.
[02:03:43.266 --> 02:03:44.287]  We're a big talk show.
[02:03:44.747 --> 02:03:45.588]  People are driving around.
[02:03:45.728 --> 02:03:47.649]  I'm sure people will investigate this.
[02:03:47.729 --> 02:03:48.849]  I don't know if what you're saying is true.
[02:03:49.449 --> 02:03:51.230]  I will try to look into it some.
[02:03:52.351 --> 02:03:53.592]  I know this, though, in closing.
[02:03:54.132 --> 02:03:56.553]  They're definitely trying to cover up something with the pipe bomb.
[02:03:56.873 --> 02:03:58.854]  What do you think they were actually planning that day?
[02:03:59.234 --> 02:04:00.375]  Why did they not go with it?
[02:04:03.328 --> 02:04:04.629]  I don't know all the details, Alex.
[02:04:04.669 --> 02:04:06.250]  I only know John McGreevy told the truth.
[02:04:06.290 --> 02:04:06.890]  That's all I got.
[02:04:07.110 --> 02:04:07.430]  All right.
[02:04:07.490 --> 02:04:12.834]  Well, so I don't, I mean, you're like, you had a guest host on to this.
[02:04:13.214 --> 02:04:15.615]  Dude, I don't, I like our other shows.
[02:04:15.655 --> 02:04:16.456]  I like Owen's show.
[02:04:16.496 --> 02:04:17.636]  I like Harrison's show.
[02:04:18.137 --> 02:04:19.578]  I'm usually busy working.
[02:04:19.858 --> 02:04:21.479]  I don't, I'm not omnipresent.
[02:04:22.270 --> 02:04:24.032]  Some people call and they say, why don't you cover this?
[02:04:24.052 --> 02:04:25.893]  A lot of them are like, what's going on?
[02:04:26.874 --> 02:04:27.895]  Or the phones will start ringing.
[02:04:27.915 --> 02:04:30.958]  Why is it Jones covering the school shooting happening now that started an hour ago?
[02:04:31.419 --> 02:04:32.780]  I'm not God, folks.
[02:04:32.800 --> 02:04:33.320]  Far from it.
[02:04:35.717 --> 02:04:37.179]  That's why I take your calls.
[02:04:37.359 --> 02:04:40.703]  These are unfiltered, and it's like all sorts of stuff comes out.
[02:04:40.743 --> 02:04:46.549]  It's always interesting, today particularly, but it's up to people to look into this for themselves.
[02:04:47.070 --> 02:04:49.572]  I remember the name you said.
[02:04:49.592 --> 02:04:50.974]  I knew that was tied to Jade Nex.
[02:04:51.855 --> 02:04:52.956]  All right, we'll be right back.
[02:04:53.156 --> 02:04:54.218]  Stay with us.
[02:04:54.258 --> 02:04:57.141]  We've got huge guests coming up, and I'll get to all your calls as well.
[02:04:58.666 --> 02:05:00.947]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[02:05:01.087 --> 02:05:01.427]  Thank you.
[02:05:01.627 --> 02:05:04.188]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[02:05:04.248 --> 02:05:05.508]  I started taking that stuff.
[02:05:05.568 --> 02:05:08.729]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[02:05:08.849 --> 02:05:09.749]  When did you start taking it?
[02:05:10.030 --> 02:05:14.011]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure, and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[02:05:14.151 --> 02:05:14.391]  Mm-hmm.
[02:05:14.651 --> 02:05:17.353]  And I started eating a little better, but my blood pressure stayed high.
[02:05:17.373 --> 02:05:24.900]  And when I took X2 iodine after about two or four weeks, I think my body detoxified of a bunch of metals and stuff that my body was storing.
[02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.202]  And my blood pressure came down to the perfect level.
[02:05:27.602 --> 02:05:30.525]  And I tell people the only thing I did was X2 iodine.
[02:05:30.985 --> 02:05:44.874]  And even though I do think all your other products are good, I recommend to anybody that they start with X2 iodine because it detoxifies your body and kind of kicks your natural DNA into full force.
[02:05:44.954 --> 02:05:48.436]  So in my life, I found X2 iodine the best.
[02:05:48.896 --> 02:05:52.338]  I tried other iodines and they didn't have the same effect.
[02:05:52.638 --> 02:05:54.940]  So X2 iodine, I really wanted to point that out.
[02:06:01.024 --> 02:06:02.966]  Waiting war on corruption.
[02:06:03.506 --> 02:06:08.710]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:10.351 --> 02:06:11.332]  All right.
[02:06:31.447 --> 02:06:50.321]  I get so frustrated, and I'm not mad at people, I just get so frustrated when I see all these new headlines saying, NGOs discovered from the UN and from other organizations, the Democratic Party and the State Department, building refugee centers and shipping illegals in.
[02:06:50.802 --> 02:06:52.263]  That's just running the whole show.
[02:06:52.283 --> 02:06:53.624]  That's where Mayorkas comes from.
[02:06:54.104 --> 02:06:56.105]  And the same big UN NGO...
[02:06:56.926 --> 02:06:57.446]  We're good to go.
[02:07:12.992 --> 02:07:18.577]  In consultation with New Yorkers who went and visited this giant refugee resettlement operation.
[02:07:18.617 --> 02:07:24.822]  Yes, our government's paying for highways and roads and credit cards and bus tickets and plane tickets.
[02:07:25.203 --> 02:07:27.785]  And Congress can kill the damn funding.
[02:07:29.146 --> 02:07:35.031]  Instead, constant discussions and these constant discussions
[02:07:36.246 --> 02:07:39.727]  Debates with Mayorkas about whether the border is broken or not.
[02:07:39.807 --> 02:07:42.348]  We know the names of the NGOs.
[02:07:42.708 --> 02:07:43.548]  We have the videos.
[02:07:43.848 --> 02:07:44.728]  We have the photos.
[02:07:45.128 --> 02:07:48.129]  We have them bragging about all of it.
[02:07:49.930 --> 02:08:01.113]  And joining us is the great Michael Yan, former Army Special Operations operative and one of the best known, if not the best known, military correspondents in combat.
[02:08:02.039 --> 02:08:02.519]  I think we're good to go.
[02:08:02.539 --> 02:08:03.080]  I think we're good to go.
[02:08:30.097 --> 02:08:40.035]  He's been down there for years, and now they built giant camps and roads and bridges and boats pulling up, just thousands of Chinese pouring across, and it's like, where's Congress?
[02:08:40.055 --> 02:08:41.818]  They're always a million years behind.
[02:08:43.189 --> 02:08:44.790]  Absolutely ridiculous.
[02:08:44.911 --> 02:08:47.273]  So Michael Young joins us.
[02:08:47.773 --> 02:08:48.774]  We've got a lot of videos.
[02:08:48.794 --> 02:08:50.896]  We've got a boil-down video he sent us as well.
[02:08:51.336 --> 02:08:53.177]  So Michael, whenever you're ready, they've got the videos.
[02:08:53.197 --> 02:08:54.338]  You can call for what you want.
[02:08:54.659 --> 02:08:56.040]  We can get into who Mayorkas is.
[02:08:56.080 --> 02:08:59.243]  He's not just some buffoon, some incompetent.
[02:08:59.283 --> 02:09:00.564]  This is part of an operation.
[02:09:00.584 --> 02:09:01.765]  So I'm going to try to give you the floor.
[02:09:02.165 --> 02:09:03.806]  So don't stop or I'll jump in.
[02:09:03.826 --> 02:09:06.649]  You can tell the crew when you want to play your four-minute compilation.
[02:09:06.669 --> 02:09:09.131]  You can start wherever you want to begin here.
[02:09:10.846 --> 02:09:11.447]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:09:12.007 --> 02:09:13.569]  I really appreciate your having me on.
[02:09:13.649 --> 02:09:14.990]  I just got out of the jungle.
[02:09:16.091 --> 02:09:19.053]  Let me set the table about what's going on right now and where I'm at.
[02:09:19.374 --> 02:09:20.975]  I am at Panama City now.
[02:09:21.095 --> 02:09:22.657]  I'm back out of the Darien Gap.
[02:09:23.077 --> 02:09:24.939]  That's the Panama Canal behind me.
[02:09:25.379 --> 02:09:34.307]  I just took down into the jungle Japanese journalists Masako Ganaha, Ann VanderSteel, Brett Weinstein, and Chris Martinson.
[02:09:34.747 --> 02:09:36.528]  Chris Martinson's been on your show before.
[02:09:36.928 --> 02:09:43.312]  And so I just took those four and some others down into the Darien Gap, and we went deep into the jungle, and we saw many things.
[02:09:43.372 --> 02:09:48.874]  And by the way, two days ago, weirdly, this is the bridge that they're building down by Yavitza, by the way.
[02:09:49.415 --> 02:09:55.258]  So this new bridge that they're building... And by the way, a lot of this is exclusive, never-before-seen breaking now.
[02:09:56.733 --> 02:09:57.254]  Absolutely.
[02:09:58.195 --> 02:10:04.003]  This is, for instance, this map right there came out of a book, you know, with that red cover that you just saw.
[02:10:04.023 --> 02:10:05.905]  This is drone footage we just made.
[02:10:06.285 --> 02:10:09.470]  That's the new road being built into the Darien Gap.
[02:10:09.850 --> 02:10:13.315]  And this bridge that's going over the Rio Chucanaca is near Uvica.
[02:10:13.835 --> 02:10:22.318]  Yavita is the little town of about 2,000 people at the end of the road of Highway 1, the Pan-American Highway.
[02:10:22.658 --> 02:10:33.022]  And so that red book there, the China's Belt and Road Initiative book, was first published in Spanish, and then they translated it to English.
[02:10:33.082 --> 02:10:35.983]  I got the English version, and I got that map out of it.
[02:10:36.323 --> 02:10:37.224]  We're good to go.
[02:10:37.244 --> 02:10:37.544]  I think?
[02:10:55.834 --> 02:11:02.616]  But there's billions, and I mean billions with a B, dollars worth of trees out in that jungle, the Darien Gap jungle.
[02:11:02.996 --> 02:11:10.518]  So the Chinese will build those bridges for the Ibra Indians, the Wunan Indians, and others in exchange for their trees.
[02:11:10.858 --> 02:11:18.300]  Now, the Indians do sell the trees at about $20 each, except for the Cocobolo trees, which are about $2,000 per ton.
[02:11:18.620 --> 02:11:20.780]  But those trees are like drugs.
[02:11:21.181 --> 02:11:22.801]  In other words, they're worth a lot.
[02:11:22.841 --> 02:11:23.342]  I think so.
[02:11:40.183 --> 02:11:42.804]  The Darien Gap is essentially open at this point already.
[02:11:42.984 --> 02:11:47.845]  There's no paved road all the way through, but we have thousands of people come through a day at this point.
[02:11:48.185 --> 02:11:51.226]  Last August there was 82,000 in one month.
[02:11:51.266 --> 02:11:53.067]  That was the highest number that I know of.
[02:11:53.407 --> 02:11:54.787]  That number is increasing.
[02:11:55.127 --> 02:11:57.588]  However, a lot of people are going around the Gap now.
[02:11:57.668 --> 02:12:05.010]  For instance, they're flying straight to Nicaragua, flying straight from Colombia to the United States.
[02:12:05.770 --> 02:12:08.551]  A lot of people, in other words, they're bypassing the Gap.
[02:12:09.051 --> 02:12:09.891]  We're good to go.
[02:12:09.911 --> 02:12:10.412]  We're good to go.
[02:12:32.020 --> 02:12:33.701]  And so this is so strategic for us.
[02:12:33.721 --> 02:12:35.002]  I've been at military base.
[02:12:35.022 --> 02:12:41.605]  We're just letting the shy comms, everybody, come in, buy out the government, build bridges, set up UN camps, bring in all these people.
[02:12:41.885 --> 02:12:43.406]  Mayorkas goes and tours the camps.
[02:12:43.426 --> 02:12:44.147]  You caught him there.
[02:12:44.687 --> 02:12:47.769]  And then they fund their State Department money, this invasion.
[02:12:48.089 --> 02:12:50.650]  And then Congress in these hearings never brings it up.
[02:12:50.970 --> 02:12:51.691]  It's incredible.
[02:12:53.035 --> 02:12:55.858]  Yeah, actually, you might hear the train going by right now.
[02:12:56.778 --> 02:12:58.780]  This is the canal behind me, and there's a train.
[02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:02.063]  The famous Panama Canal train is between me and that canal.
[02:13:02.543 --> 02:13:07.668]  And they're using that train a lot now because the Lake Gatuna is so low, they can hear the train.
[02:13:08.489 --> 02:13:12.872]  And so they're filling up that train with a lot of the cargo that's normally on the ships, right?
[02:13:13.353 --> 02:13:16.195]  And so we just went through the dairy.
[02:13:16.295 --> 02:13:17.637]  We just went through the Panama Canal.
[02:13:17.837 --> 02:13:18.898]  Actually, that's right behind me.
[02:13:18.918 --> 02:13:20.079]  That's Mira Flores Locks.
[02:13:20.895 --> 02:13:22.877]  When we just went through the canal a few days ago.
[02:13:23.317 --> 02:13:25.478]  Now, I'm sorry if that trains too loud.
[02:13:25.498 --> 02:13:26.759]  That's literally the... No, it's not.
[02:13:26.779 --> 02:13:33.083]  Now, when it comes to Mayorkas, Mayorkas has gone down to the Darien at least twice that I know of.
[02:13:33.183 --> 02:13:38.427]  I was there when he went down on August, I'm sorry, April 18th of 2022.
[02:13:38.827 --> 02:13:39.988]  I waited for four days.
[02:13:40.348 --> 02:13:42.590]  He came down in four Black Hawk helicopters.
[02:13:43.370 --> 02:13:50.435]  The South Commander was there, actually, Laura Richardson, the Commanding General, and our Ambassador Aponte was there as well.
[02:13:50.835 --> 02:13:51.175]  We're good to go.
[02:14:12.321 --> 02:14:12.481]  I think?
[02:14:28.069 --> 02:14:28.309]  I think.
[02:14:53.298 --> 02:14:59.201]  The China camp that you just showed earlier, that's footage that I made of China camp and that footage of HIAS.
[02:14:59.921 --> 02:15:06.203]  I was just with Brett Weinstein and Chris Martinson right in front of the HIAS office, right beside the China camp.
[02:15:06.584 --> 02:15:09.625]  That Mayorkas flew down in his Blackhawks to build up.
[02:15:10.005 --> 02:15:18.488]  Now, when Mayorkas came in April of 2022, he promised to help build up these camps in the dairy.
[02:15:18.729 --> 02:15:19.729]  He has now done that.
[02:15:20.089 --> 02:15:20.830]  We're good to go.
[02:15:37.220 --> 02:15:45.627]  The China camp is the trailers in China camp that you saw in the video that I sent you.
[02:15:45.687 --> 02:15:48.469]  Those trailers are actually made in China.
[02:15:48.790 --> 02:15:54.354]  So actually, the materials, much of the materials inside of the camp that we paid for with U.S.
[02:15:54.394 --> 02:15:55.175]  taxpayer money
[02:15:56.428 --> 02:15:57.710]  We actually bought it in China.
[02:15:58.050 --> 02:16:04.018]  I mean, that's Mayorkas landing on April 18, 2022, just beside China Camp.
[02:16:04.399 --> 02:16:12.870]  So he landed in the Blackhawks and stayed for a few hours, and then he took off, and I watched him land, and I watched him take off, and I have footage of them.
[02:16:13.071 --> 02:16:13.611]  And they also...
[02:16:14.432 --> 02:16:14.792]  I think?
[02:16:33.604 --> 02:16:34.085]  We're good to go.
[02:16:52.344 --> 02:16:57.127]  You know, Guatemala, okay, I just circled that for you just before we went online.
[02:16:57.487 --> 02:17:06.993]  That's the highest building to the left, and in fact, I tried to rent that building, but highest got it before me, and that's the camp right there on the right, which I call China Camp.
[02:17:07.033 --> 02:17:08.093]  That's in the Darien Gap.
[02:17:08.374 --> 02:17:11.095]  That road on the far left is the Pan American Highway.
[02:17:11.415 --> 02:17:14.037]  This is more like, okay, that's the way it was on April 18, 2022.
[02:17:16.238 --> 02:17:21.441]  Now, if you go to the next photo, it's a lot of trailers, and it's a lot larger.
[02:17:21.801 --> 02:17:22.442]  Okay, not that.
[02:17:22.502 --> 02:17:23.603]  That's still April 18th.
[02:17:23.683 --> 02:17:25.304]  That's his security right there on the right.
[02:17:25.724 --> 02:17:27.885]  Okay, that's the way it is now.
[02:17:27.945 --> 02:17:29.326]  That was January.
[02:17:29.666 --> 02:17:30.627]  That was just like, what?
[02:17:30.727 --> 02:17:31.888]  That was 18th of January.
[02:17:31.928 --> 02:17:35.590]  That's like six days ago or so, or five days ago, right?
[02:17:35.870 --> 02:17:37.431]  So that's the way it is right now.
[02:17:37.951 --> 02:17:38.751]  I think we're good to go.
[02:18:04.679 --> 02:18:05.419]  We're good to go.
[02:18:22.848 --> 02:18:32.533]  It's a program called Controlled Flow that was actually made by the United States, or let's say brokered, so that the flow between Costa Rica and Panama is much faster.
[02:18:32.893 --> 02:18:40.477]  So I want to say... So Mayorkas acts like he's against all this, but the State Department's funding it, and that's on record.
[02:18:40.517 --> 02:18:43.619]  So why isn't Congress, when I see the hearings, bringing this up?
[02:18:43.879 --> 02:18:47.861]  They talk about what hits our border, but they never talk about how our government's funding it.
[02:18:48.441 --> 02:18:51.563]  Shouldn't we be able to make a political uproar and shut the funding down?
[02:18:52.935 --> 02:19:02.922]  Well, you know, all the congressmen that I speak with, which is a lot, they almost, Tom Tiffany does, Congressman Tiffany, if you have him on, he can give you a proper briefing.
[02:19:03.222 --> 02:19:03.942]  He's from West Conc.
[02:19:04.203 --> 02:19:05.584]  I took him into the Darien Gap.
[02:19:05.884 --> 02:19:09.366]  Congressman Tiffany went down two or three years ago with me, right?
[02:19:09.846 --> 02:19:11.788]  And so he'll give you a proper briefing.
[02:19:12.048 --> 02:19:18.592]  But most of the others, the only ones that know anything about him are the ones that have talked with people like me or Todd Benson, right?
[02:19:19.633 --> 02:19:21.034]  Most of the others are just clueless.
[02:19:21.334 --> 02:19:29.515]  Yeah, but it's so frustrating because you've been out there for years, been on the show for over a year, saying they're building the camp, now it's built, they're building the roads, they're building the roads, they're building the bridges.
[02:19:30.556 --> 02:19:34.796]  And then he sits there and acts dumb about where these giant caravans are coming from.
[02:19:35.397 --> 02:19:39.737]  So it's got to be the Republicans know this is happening and are just pretending like they're ignorant.
[02:19:40.918 --> 02:19:41.838]  Oh, yeah.
[02:19:41.858 --> 02:19:43.138]  And you see Mayorkas there.
[02:19:43.438 --> 02:19:46.499]  He's at Mayor Flores Locks, which is right behind me out here, actually.
[02:19:46.739 --> 02:19:48.559]  And it looks like he's with the Secretary of State right there.
[02:19:49.451 --> 02:19:50.612]  Yeah, Blinken came down, too.
[02:19:50.652 --> 02:19:54.535]  And you can see some of the things that Blinken said about opening it up here.
[02:19:54.615 --> 02:19:56.297]  He's in deep collusion.
[02:19:56.677 --> 02:20:00.360]  Now, I just took, again, I just took Brett Weinstein and Dr. Chris Martinson down.
[02:20:00.640 --> 02:20:02.622]  They just got on the airplane yesterday and went back.
[02:20:02.682 --> 02:20:03.823]  We were with them for about a week.
[02:20:04.263 --> 02:20:06.926]  And we took them out to a lot of the camps, and we saw them a lot.
[02:20:07.266 --> 02:20:09.508]  You could see their eyes just exploded.
[02:20:09.928 --> 02:20:14.892]  They could hardly believe what they saw, not just in Darien, but where I'm at right now.
[02:20:14.912 --> 02:20:16.574]  Isn't it a wake-up for one of the most famous...
[02:20:16.954 --> 02:20:21.738]  Intellectual liberals, Brett Weinstein, he now says they released the virus as a weapon to take over.
[02:20:22.038 --> 02:20:23.860]  They're establishing a UN treaty, world government.
[02:20:24.120 --> 02:20:25.721]  They're using illegal aliens as weapons.
[02:20:26.162 --> 02:20:28.444]  All these former big liberals like Jimmy Dore now get it.
[02:20:28.764 --> 02:20:31.486]  So what's exciting is we're actually taking liberals down.
[02:20:31.826 --> 02:20:33.568]  You're taking liberals down and they're waking up.
[02:20:34.907 --> 02:20:35.788]  Oh, you should have seen.
[02:20:35.989 --> 02:20:37.270]  Brett totally woke up.
[02:20:37.310 --> 02:20:39.794]  He said, well, there's Masako Ganaha, actually.
[02:20:40.154 --> 02:20:41.476]  She's still here in Panama.
[02:20:41.516 --> 02:20:43.899]  She's unbelievable.
[02:20:44.500 --> 02:20:47.484]  Masako's been out in Darien, I don't know, probably a dozen times.
[02:20:47.544 --> 02:20:48.886]  I don't even know.
[02:20:49.286 --> 02:20:49.567]  Anyway...
[02:20:49.887 --> 02:20:50.388]  We're good to go.
[02:21:12.228 --> 02:21:12.749]  We'd stop.
[02:21:12.789 --> 02:21:14.090]  We were on a small boat.
[02:21:14.570 --> 02:21:19.774]  As we came back from when we just did this, there were a monkey was swimming.
[02:21:20.415 --> 02:21:26.180]  Keep in mind, Brett Weinstein used to work in the canal at a place called Barra, Colorado Island.
[02:21:26.420 --> 02:21:28.121]  He's an evolutionary biologist, right?
[02:21:28.382 --> 02:21:30.663]  So he did a lot of the study down here in Panama.
[02:21:31.164 --> 02:21:31.944]  There's the monkey.
[02:21:32.005 --> 02:21:34.366]  The monkey was swimming across the canal.
[02:21:34.827 --> 02:21:36.849]  None of the people here had ever seen that before.
[02:21:37.609 --> 02:21:38.690]  Brett had never seen it.
[02:21:38.710 --> 02:21:41.012]  I've been talking with a lot of people.
[02:21:41.112 --> 02:21:43.658]  And a big container ship almost killed it.
[02:21:44.605 --> 02:21:46.806]  Yeah, the container ship sort of hit it.
[02:21:46.847 --> 02:21:54.171]  The water moved it out of the way, and the monkey kept trying to grab the container ship.
[02:21:54.191 --> 02:21:56.693]  I wanted to grab the monkey, but I didn't want to die.
[02:21:56.933 --> 02:21:58.694]  Those monkeys will eat you up.
[02:21:59.655 --> 02:22:02.217]  But anyway, somebody came along with a net.
[02:22:02.417 --> 02:22:05.099]  Actually, I know the people that did it, as it turns out.
[02:22:05.339 --> 02:22:06.800]  They came along with a fishing net.
[02:22:06.840 --> 02:22:08.301]  They were actually on a fishing tour.
[02:22:08.641 --> 02:22:11.283]  They came along and netted this monkey and put him in a tree.
[02:22:12.243 --> 02:22:14.365]  You know, my friend Matt Bracken that you know,
[02:22:14.565 --> 02:22:17.105]  Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL, he saw this.
[02:22:17.125 --> 02:22:19.666]  He said, that monkey ought to be a SEAL.
[02:22:19.906 --> 02:22:23.547]  You can see the monkey was getting a little tired right when he shows up with the net.
[02:22:25.927 --> 02:22:28.587]  It made all of us so happy the monkey didn't die.
[02:22:28.627 --> 02:22:31.008]  Just amazing stuff.
[02:22:31.028 --> 02:22:33.908]  But first, give us a 35,000-foot view here.
[02:22:34.809 --> 02:22:38.809]  Listeners, just like they planned new lockdowns last year, we exposed it.
[02:22:39.309 --> 02:22:42.230]  They still tried it, but it was defeated because people knew
[02:22:43.071 --> 02:22:44.597]  We have giant roads.
[02:22:45.831 --> 02:22:47.931]  Invasion points, bridges being built.
[02:22:48.471 --> 02:22:55.073]  We have signs up, the UN funding it, State Department funding it, our government funding it, creating this.
[02:22:55.393 --> 02:23:00.754]  And you were telling me you think it'll be up to millions every few months soon just through this area.
[02:23:01.854 --> 02:23:04.074]  Again, that's what shuts it off.
[02:23:04.134 --> 02:23:06.135]  Not trying to build fences on our border.
[02:23:06.575 --> 02:23:07.795]  We control Panama.
[02:23:07.815 --> 02:23:09.035]  We have to shut it down there.
[02:23:09.435 --> 02:23:13.736]  So easy to do, but not once they get these official concrete bridges in.
[02:23:15.242 --> 02:23:18.004]  The problem is our government is doing it.
[02:23:18.164 --> 02:23:20.046]  That's what a lot of people don't quite understand.
[02:23:20.106 --> 02:23:22.507]  They keep saying, yeah, but who's actually doing it?
[02:23:22.547 --> 02:23:24.829]  And I'll say, let me repeat what I just said.
[02:23:25.229 --> 02:23:26.530]  Our government is doing it.
[02:23:26.570 --> 02:23:27.771]  They're like, yeah, but who's behind it?
[02:23:27.851 --> 02:23:28.312]  I'm like, well...
[02:23:29.653 --> 02:23:34.094]  You know, like, you know, the president and the so-called president, Mayorkas, Blinken.
[02:23:34.595 --> 02:23:35.455]  But who's behind it?
[02:23:35.715 --> 02:23:36.895]  Our government is behind it.
[02:23:37.275 --> 02:23:42.957]  And the World Economic Forum and the Chinese Communist Party, which clearly have captured key parts of our government.
[02:23:43.297 --> 02:23:45.398]  Like, for instance, Greg Abbott, state government.
[02:23:45.738 --> 02:23:47.500]  He's clearing the decks for more to come in.
[02:24:06.858 --> 02:24:08.198]  Abbott could close the border.
[02:24:08.479 --> 02:24:10.039]  He's just a member of WEF.
[02:24:10.159 --> 02:24:11.479]  That's all you need to know.
[02:24:11.880 --> 02:24:17.401]  Bottom line is, the border will stay open as long as Abbott is the governor of Texas.
[02:24:17.781 --> 02:24:20.822]  It'll stay open as long as you have all these blue governors.
[02:24:20.842 --> 02:24:27.164]  Well, listen, I really respect you, because I wanted to think a few weeks ago, maybe he's going down to Eagle Pass doing some control.
[02:24:29.225 --> 02:24:30.605]  But you're saying it's all cosmetic.
[02:24:32.206 --> 02:24:33.388]  It's kayfabe.
[02:24:33.488 --> 02:24:36.311]  It's a professional wrestling match.
[02:24:36.772 --> 02:24:40.696]  Every time they do this, when he put up the rubber barriers in the Rio Grande, I was there.
[02:24:40.736 --> 02:24:42.318]  When he put up the containers, I was there.
[02:24:42.338 --> 02:24:44.180]  When he puts up the concertina, I was there.
[02:24:45.141 --> 02:24:49.225]  We've gotten to the point where it's like, look, all you need to know is what uniform does Abbott wear.
[02:24:49.406 --> 02:24:50.146]  That's all you need to know.
[02:24:50.487 --> 02:24:51.628]  He wears the WEF uniform.
[02:24:51.848 --> 02:24:52.189]  Period.
[02:24:52.489 --> 02:25:03.615]  Wef is, as you well know, you know this better than probably anybody on this planet, World Economic Forum and the Chinese Communist Party, they're as aligned as Germany and Italy were in World War II.
[02:25:04.095 --> 02:25:10.119]  So if you are a member of the World Economic Forum, you're aligned with China on many of these things.
[02:25:10.139 --> 02:25:13.261]  You keep in mind, Chinese are using that camp.
[02:25:13.341 --> 02:25:14.721]  That's why I call it China Camp.
[02:25:15.042 --> 02:25:21.065]  Not only do they use that camp, that's their main invasion route from South America is the camp that Mayorkas built.
[02:25:21.565 --> 02:25:23.887]  I mean, with our money, with American money.
[02:25:24.507 --> 02:25:29.770]  That camp, that camp, okay, that was April 18th, 2022, when Mayorkas came.
[02:25:29.810 --> 02:25:35.394]  He had just come either just before this or just after because his security cars are not in that photo.
[02:25:35.814 --> 02:25:37.535]  But I made that video.
[02:25:37.575 --> 02:25:40.277]  And then, boom, we skip ahead to a few days ago and how big it is.
[02:25:41.192 --> 02:25:42.033]  Yeah, it's huge.
[02:25:42.434 --> 02:25:44.457]  And so, I mean, I'm down there all the time.
[02:25:44.858 --> 02:25:48.944]  And so, and the camps are, I want to say again, so that's the way it just was.
[02:25:49.325 --> 02:25:53.952]  And I want to say again that these camps not only are bigger, and this isn't the only one.
[02:25:53.972 --> 02:25:56.396]  There are others we could go down this rabbit hole for hours.
[02:25:56.886 --> 02:25:59.728]  There are others, but more importantly, they're more efficient.
[02:26:00.068 --> 02:26:01.068]  The pipe is smooth.
[02:26:01.108 --> 02:26:02.169]  The pipe is fast.
[02:26:02.509 --> 02:26:05.050]  So the water is flowing faster and faster.
[02:26:05.471 --> 02:26:08.892]  So you've got, it's much easier for, and it's now IOM.
[02:26:09.173 --> 02:26:10.233]  You know about IOM.
[02:26:10.373 --> 02:26:19.258]  Most people, almost every congressperson, when Brett Weinstein first came down here and Chris Martinson, they didn't know what IOM was just a couple of weeks ago, right?
[02:26:19.498 --> 02:26:24.381]  And I'm like, before you come down, you need to know who IOM is because I'm going to introduce you to IOM.
[02:26:24.821 --> 02:26:28.109]  And when you're in the airports coming down here, keep your eyes out for Iowa.
[02:26:28.129 --> 02:26:30.394]  So explain who the NGOs are.
[02:26:31.294 --> 02:26:36.777]  The International Organization for Migration, IOM, is run by an evil lady named Amy Pope.
[02:26:36.837 --> 02:26:39.338]  She's been in charge for maybe four or four and a half months.
[02:26:39.899 --> 02:26:43.541]  She brags that the number one funder for IOM is the United States.
[02:26:43.661 --> 02:26:44.761]  Number two is Germany.
[02:26:44.821 --> 02:26:45.922]  Number three is Canada.
[02:26:46.382 --> 02:26:51.665]  IOM also has an office in Yemen, by the way, and Yemenis do come through the Darien Gap.
[02:26:51.925 --> 02:26:56.828]  Now, IOM, their office, if they could turn this window 90 degrees, you would see their office.
[02:26:57.208 --> 02:27:00.189]  Their flag, I'm in what's called the City of Knowledge.
[02:27:00.709 --> 02:27:03.930]  I'm in the City of Knowledge in Panama, right?
[02:27:04.651 --> 02:27:06.371]  And so this used to be the U.S.
[02:27:06.431 --> 02:27:07.512]  Army South headquarters.
[02:27:07.872 --> 02:27:09.252]  Now it's called the City of Knowledge.
[02:27:09.613 --> 02:27:10.513]  They've taken it over.
[02:27:10.773 --> 02:27:14.874]  About 62 NGOs, IGOs, and nonprofits.
[02:27:15.695 --> 02:27:18.456]  A very kind lady named Heather, I won't say her last name.
[02:27:18.816 --> 02:27:24.558]  She's an intel lady, did a lot of study on this, and she has reached out to Harrison about coming on to present this.
[02:27:24.898 --> 02:27:25.499]  We're good to go.
[02:27:45.635 --> 02:28:00.019]  While they cut off the resources in the third world, flood us with these people who they then politically control, who they sign up for welfare, you name it, and skim money off of, this is a UN globalist invasion run by our own government happening in our face.
[02:28:01.502 --> 02:28:01.702]  Right.
[02:28:01.922 --> 02:28:02.183]  It is.
[02:28:02.303 --> 02:28:03.304]  It's a straight-up invasion.
[02:28:03.524 --> 02:28:05.185]  It's hardcore.
[02:28:05.585 --> 02:28:07.587]  And it's being done by the United States government.
[02:28:08.187 --> 02:28:11.730]  So, I mean, it's also in Europe.
[02:28:11.750 --> 02:28:15.954]  When you go to Europe, like we've gone down to Morocco and Lithuania, all over Europe.
[02:28:16.194 --> 02:28:17.075]  You know, Luxembourg.
[02:28:17.515 --> 02:28:22.799]  Let's come back and talk about what happened to Europe and how they're a little bit ahead of us on this and where this endgame goes if we don't stop it.
[02:28:22.819 --> 02:28:22.939]  But...
[02:28:23.860 --> 02:28:26.442]  Again, Congress is only the point of the border's broken.
[02:28:26.462 --> 02:28:28.503]  Remember, last few years, Mayorkas is not broken.
[02:28:28.523 --> 02:28:29.604]  Now he's okay, it's broken.
[02:28:29.644 --> 02:28:30.324]  Legalize everybody.
[02:28:30.905 --> 02:28:34.007]  So, we need to get to the point of, no, our government's running this.
[02:28:34.547 --> 02:28:35.748]  And then that cuts the funding.
[02:28:35.768 --> 02:28:40.871]  And that's what this whole discussion's about, folks, is actually cutting the State Department money off.
[02:28:41.212 --> 02:28:42.933]  Michael Yan, investigative journalist, is our guest.
[02:28:43.293 --> 02:28:45.054]  He's in Panama, just came out of the jungle.
[02:28:45.535 --> 02:28:46.235]  He's amazing.
[02:28:46.775 --> 02:28:49.497]  Tell everybody you know and those you don't know, tell everybody, tune in now.
[02:28:49.918 --> 02:28:51.118]  They don't want this information getting out.
[02:28:51.599 --> 02:28:53.340]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:28:54.401 --> 02:28:54.941]  We're good to go.
[02:29:22.380 --> 02:29:32.446]  This is the breakdown product after your cells process it of folic acid, methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[02:29:32.906 --> 02:29:34.127]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[02:29:34.167 --> 02:29:35.028]  It's not a stimulant.
[02:29:35.288 --> 02:29:37.089]  It energizes your cells.
[02:29:37.609 --> 02:29:37.990]  We're good to go.
[02:29:58.775 --> 02:30:01.898]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:30:01.918 --> 02:30:03.439]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:30:04.200 --> 02:30:07.242]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:30:08.143 --> 02:30:16.230]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:30:17.090 --> 02:30:23.035]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[02:30:23.976 --> 02:30:24.857]  It's really just incredible.
[02:30:25.879 --> 02:30:28.760]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:30:29.540 --> 02:30:34.521]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:30:35.322 --> 02:30:36.222]  I know you spread the word.
[02:30:36.262 --> 02:30:37.742]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[02:30:37.782 --> 02:30:38.303]  Keep doing it.
[02:30:38.343 --> 02:30:44.964]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[02:30:45.405 --> 02:30:46.585]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[02:30:47.265 --> 02:30:50.927]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:30:51.588 --> 02:30:56.211]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsStore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:30:56.531 --> 02:30:57.372]  Please take action now.
[02:30:57.552 --> 02:30:59.153]  I'm not on Team NFL.
[02:30:59.453 --> 02:31:00.954]  I'm not on Team NBA.
[02:31:01.134 --> 02:31:02.115]  I'm not on Team Olympics.
[02:31:02.395 --> 02:31:05.797]  I'm not on Team Globalist or Wokeism in the New World Order.
[02:31:06.057 --> 02:31:08.739]  I'm on Team Humanity, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:09.019 --> 02:31:09.659]  We're good to go.
[02:31:37.586 --> 02:31:38.327]  We're good to go.
[02:31:38.347 --> 02:31:38.867]  We're good to go.
[02:31:57.622 --> 02:31:58.042]  We're good to go.
[02:32:24.103 --> 02:32:32.130]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best-tasting, best-smelling, strongest coffee that I have ever drank.
[02:32:32.611 --> 02:32:34.032]  It is game-changing.
[02:32:34.472 --> 02:32:36.634]  All you've got to do is buy a bag of it and try it.
[02:32:36.654 --> 02:32:39.817]  I know you're going to be hooked, which will then fund your operation, a 360 win.
[02:32:40.077 --> 02:32:44.061]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com right now for Escape to Prison Planet Light Roast.
[02:32:44.101 --> 02:32:47.544]  That's the strongest, the amazing medium roast wig of America.
[02:32:48.004 --> 02:32:55.250]  And finally, the best tasting, dark roast, tip of the spear, now exclusively available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:32:55.491 --> 02:32:56.331]  Get your coffee now.
[02:32:58.894 --> 02:33:04.799]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:09.062 --> 02:33:10.063]  We're good to go.
[02:33:10.083 --> 02:33:12.124]  We're good to go.
[02:33:36.312 --> 02:33:41.697]  I am beyond frustrated because we have the keys to victory to stopping the globalists.
[02:33:42.457 --> 02:33:45.039]  The UN doesn't invade with troops and blue helmets.
[02:33:45.860 --> 02:33:48.122]  Oh, I ever see you in blue helmets, we always hear.
[02:33:48.182 --> 02:33:48.842]  I'm going to get them.
[02:33:49.203 --> 02:33:50.564]  When that day comes, I'm ready.
[02:33:50.624 --> 02:33:51.685]  I got plenty of guns.
[02:33:52.926 --> 02:33:53.707]  They don't invade.
[02:33:53.747 --> 02:33:56.989]  They invade through the IMF, through the World Bank, through the policy.
[02:33:57.009 --> 02:34:04.716]  They're cutting off our pipelines, our infrastructure, flooding us with fentanyl, turning our families against each other, devaluing our dollar, launching all these wars.
[02:34:06.002 --> 02:34:18.349]  And viral scares as well as, it's in all their own documents, in my film Endgame, I made in 2007, it says, their number one thing will be migrant flows, viruses, and currency crises to bring in world government.
[02:34:18.409 --> 02:34:24.672]  So, Congress still has been debating for three years with Mayorkas whether the border's broken.
[02:34:25.782 --> 02:34:29.264]  And they're finally gotten to, you're lying, we're impeaching you, it's broken, you're not doing your job.
[02:34:29.604 --> 02:34:31.765]  It's not that he's not doing his job.
[02:34:31.785 --> 02:34:39.709]  It's not like he's a fire department when a house is on fire and the fire department says we're going to eat chili and watch the football game and drink Miller Lite.
[02:34:40.569 --> 02:34:45.251]  That's dereliction of duty and that's criminal negligence and it's still wrong.
[02:34:46.372 --> 02:34:51.154]  But if the fire department went and set fire to the house, that's what we're talking about here.
[02:34:51.894 --> 02:34:53.135]  So, Mayorkas...
[02:34:54.434 --> 02:34:55.075]  We're good to go.
[02:35:09.469 --> 02:35:10.830]  We're good to go.
[02:35:10.870 --> 02:35:11.651]  I think?
[02:35:34.269 --> 02:35:36.031]  You shut the Darien Gap down.
[02:35:36.051 --> 02:35:39.455]  You shut down the invasion point for South America, Central America.
[02:35:39.475 --> 02:35:41.298]  You shut most of this down.
[02:35:42.708 --> 02:35:44.448]  So, Michael, we've talked about the problem.
[02:35:44.468 --> 02:35:46.349]  Because every time you come on, you want to show them it's happening.
[02:35:46.689 --> 02:35:47.969]  You want to show them it's getting worse.
[02:35:49.149 --> 02:35:50.910]  A few years ago, you said, look, they built the camp.
[02:35:50.950 --> 02:35:52.150]  Now it's about to get a lot bigger.
[02:35:52.170 --> 02:35:52.750]  And then it did.
[02:35:52.790 --> 02:35:54.831]  And now they're going to build permanent bridges.
[02:35:54.871 --> 02:35:55.671]  And now they're building them.
[02:35:56.091 --> 02:35:59.052]  And you've got the UN and Chinese and State Department signs.
[02:35:59.112 --> 02:36:01.152]  And we have the congressional funding doing it.
[02:36:01.452 --> 02:36:03.172]  And then again, I watched congressional hearings.
[02:36:03.733 --> 02:36:06.893]  Nothing about our government funding at all.
[02:36:06.973 --> 02:36:09.334]  Mayorkas, you sat on your hands.
[02:36:10.474 --> 02:36:20.198]  So I guess the Republican leadership, I guess you're saying Greg Abbott, they do Kabuki Theater or Iron Sheik versus Hulk Hogan, and that's all this is.
[02:36:20.639 --> 02:36:24.280]  And then meanwhile, all we've got to do is cut the funding off.
[02:36:24.600 --> 02:36:27.662]  What would happen if the funding was cut and the U.S.
[02:36:27.682 --> 02:36:30.763]  government still has some control over Panama, said get rid of those bridges?
[02:36:30.983 --> 02:36:31.643]  What would happen?
[02:36:31.704 --> 02:36:32.484]  What needs to happen?
[02:36:33.584 --> 02:36:34.224]  Oh, it'd be simple.
[02:36:34.585 --> 02:36:40.349]  You'll often hear people saying, we can't close the Darien Gap, which is complete nonsense, or we can't close the board.
[02:36:40.569 --> 02:36:42.790]  Nonsense, nonsense, nonsense.
[02:36:43.130 --> 02:36:46.052]  Anytime somebody says that, you know you're talking with a fool.
[02:36:46.513 --> 02:36:51.296]  Bottom line, the Darien Gap was closed, locked tight during the COVID lockdown.
[02:36:51.476 --> 02:36:52.016]  We're good to go.
[02:37:12.552 --> 02:37:17.916]  And so these numbers are constantly evolving, though, because, again, they don't all go through the Darien Gap.
[02:37:17.976 --> 02:37:20.378]  And, you know, Mayorkas is not sitting on his hands.
[02:37:20.658 --> 02:37:22.760]  He is part of the invasion force, right?
[02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:24.902]  And you see them talking about it.
[02:37:24.962 --> 02:37:30.526]  They're doing the old Mao thing, the communist thing, which is talk, talk, talk, fight, fight, fight, right?
[02:37:30.566 --> 02:37:32.327]  They're like, well, it's time to have talks.
[02:37:32.888 --> 02:37:34.589]  And fight, fight, fight, right?
[02:37:34.709 --> 02:37:39.373]  It's like the North Vietnamese were always having talks with us while they were kicking our ass.
[02:37:40.469 --> 02:37:42.170]  Talk, talk, talk, fight, fight, fight.
[02:37:42.190 --> 02:37:44.531]  Or actually, they would say, talk, talk, fight, fight, right?
[02:37:44.671 --> 02:37:46.912]  It's a very effective strategy.
[02:37:47.193 --> 02:37:50.574]  When Israel and Hamas did their talks, I'm like, nonsense.
[02:37:50.795 --> 02:37:52.095]  That's talk, talk, fight, fight, right?
[02:37:52.415 --> 02:37:53.616]  And you can see that, right?
[02:37:54.697 --> 02:37:55.617]  It's the normal thing.
[02:37:55.637 --> 02:37:58.759]  Hey, we're going to have talks while we clean our weapons and get ready for the next battle.
[02:37:59.079 --> 02:38:01.901]  And basically, it will continue.
[02:38:02.242 --> 02:38:12.591]  And you see the same kayfabe or, let's say, talk, talk, fight, fight going on every time Abbott and others say, hey, we're going to do something to show them what the pain is like.
[02:38:12.611 --> 02:38:15.914]  We're going to send some busloads or plane loads of people somewhere else.
[02:38:16.514 --> 02:38:19.717]  Again, he's just injecting the poison deeper into our hearts.
[02:38:20.097 --> 02:38:22.318]  This is a demographic war.
[02:38:23.078 --> 02:38:29.441]  It's obvious genocide is unfolding against Americans and Europeans, and it will happen with Japanese as well.
[02:38:29.521 --> 02:38:31.322]  I could go on in great detail about that.
[02:38:32.842 --> 02:38:38.585]  Let's shift gears into Mayorkas and the weird group that brought him in that's such a big part of this, this NGO.
[02:38:40.825 --> 02:38:41.326]  Ohio's.
[02:38:41.686 --> 02:38:46.271]  You know, the Hebrew, that organization is quite interesting.
[02:38:46.471 --> 02:38:48.153]  They're all over the place in Darien.
[02:38:48.454 --> 02:38:50.195]  Not just Darien, I see them in other places.
[02:38:50.235 --> 02:38:51.417]  I see them in Europe as well.
[02:38:51.937 --> 02:38:52.818]  And they're in the open.
[02:38:52.858 --> 02:38:57.624]  I eat lunch with them quite often in Darien because they're, again, I almost rented their office.
[02:38:57.804 --> 02:38:57.904]  That
[02:38:58.144 --> 02:39:06.317]  That office right there, that gate that you're looking at, that's the gate I just walked through with Brett Weinstein and Chris Martinson like five days ago.
[02:39:06.677 --> 02:39:07.479]  We just walked through that.
[02:39:07.839 --> 02:39:12.586]  And I love how they don't want us to have walls, but they've got a wall in Constantino around their facility.
[02:39:13.595 --> 02:39:14.075]  That's right.
[02:39:14.175 --> 02:39:17.836]  I mean, that's literally that little office right there.
[02:39:17.876 --> 02:39:19.077]  It's a house that they rented.
[02:39:19.637 --> 02:39:23.758]  They eat lunch at a restaurant like 50 yards away, and I often eat lunch with them.
[02:39:24.118 --> 02:39:27.699]  But the highest people that are there, they're just gears in the machine.
[02:39:27.739 --> 02:39:28.900]  They don't even know what's going on.
[02:39:28.920 --> 02:39:31.120]  You know, they're just a gear that does gear stuff, right?
[02:39:31.321 --> 02:39:34.702]  They don't even know that they're a gear and a clock or what time it is.
[02:39:35.062 --> 02:39:39.003]  But the highest, the larger group like Catholic Charities and whatnot,
[02:39:39.503 --> 02:39:43.788]  That is literally the Hebrew Immigration Assistance Society.
[02:39:44.168 --> 02:39:49.915]  That camp is literally just like 30 seconds walk from the front gate of China camp.
[02:39:50.295 --> 02:39:52.738]  They are literally helping the Chinese invasion.
[02:39:52.998 --> 02:39:55.141]  IS is the Jewish group, right?
[02:39:55.341 --> 02:39:56.983]  Now, is it actually a Jewish group?
[02:39:57.483 --> 02:39:59.245]  Is Catholic Charities actually Catholic?
[02:39:59.606 --> 02:40:00.266]  I do not know.
[02:40:00.607 --> 02:40:02.729]  But if they don't denounce it, then they accept it.
[02:40:03.130 --> 02:40:10.278]  If the Pope doesn't denounce Catholic Charities, who's doing a huge amount of the invasion into Texas, I'm out with those people all the time too.
[02:40:10.659 --> 02:40:13.082]  In places like McAllen or even down in Mexico.
[02:40:14.022 --> 02:40:16.564]  If the Pope doesn't denounce it, he accepts it.
[02:40:16.784 --> 02:40:17.664]  Bottom line, right?
[02:40:17.764 --> 02:40:21.326]  I mean, why is Catholic Charities a huge part of the child smuggling?
[02:40:21.686 --> 02:40:25.889]  Why is HIAS, the Jewish organization involved with child smuggling?
[02:40:26.209 --> 02:40:27.870]  Are they being denounced by...
[02:40:28.490 --> 02:40:30.331]  Well, let me move to solutions.
[02:40:30.391 --> 02:40:31.512]  Let me move to solutions.
[02:40:55.396 --> 02:40:56.537]  What do we need to do?
[02:40:57.438 --> 02:41:00.720]  What's best case scenario versus what happens if we don't get control?
[02:41:00.740 --> 02:41:04.163]  Because you were coming on two years ago, a year ago, saying it's going to be exponential.
[02:41:04.223 --> 02:41:05.864]  You've called it dead on.
[02:41:06.245 --> 02:41:09.387]  That's the guess we have back is the people that call it dead on.
[02:41:09.487 --> 02:41:10.528]  So you called it dead on.
[02:41:11.169 --> 02:41:14.391]  You can either cover what we need to do first or the bad case scenario.
[02:41:16.273 --> 02:41:16.733]  It's our government.
[02:41:17.153 --> 02:41:18.975]  I mean, as long as this government's in charge.
[02:41:19.773 --> 02:41:20.633]  We're going to get more of it.
[02:41:20.953 --> 02:41:25.155]  I mean, you know, we can't address it by my good friend Todd Binspin.
[02:41:25.315 --> 02:41:26.415]  He's a border expert.
[02:41:26.455 --> 02:41:29.076]  We've been down to Mexico and all over the border together.
[02:41:29.096 --> 02:41:36.398]  It was Todd Binspin and I and others who helped get those big lawsuits kicked off at Colony Ridge north of Houston.
[02:41:36.818 --> 02:41:38.198]  Todd is an expert on the border.
[02:41:38.218 --> 02:41:39.299]  I think he's been on your show.
[02:41:39.919 --> 02:41:43.140]  We disagree on how to treat countries like Panama.
[02:41:44.020 --> 02:41:46.421]  Todd thinks it has to be shut off down here, but it doesn't.
[02:41:46.461 --> 02:41:47.741]  It has to be shut off in Washington.
[02:41:48.858 --> 02:41:50.639]  I'm sorry, it has to be shut off in Davos.
[02:41:50.739 --> 02:41:52.040]  It has to be shut off in Geneva.
[02:41:52.060 --> 02:41:54.242]  It has to be shut off in Beijing, right?
[02:41:55.182 --> 02:41:56.683]  Sorry, I've been down in the jungle.
[02:41:56.703 --> 02:41:57.303]  No, I understand.
[02:41:58.104 --> 02:41:59.445]  And Trump's the guy to do it.
[02:41:59.505 --> 02:42:02.186]  Do you have faith in Trump if he gets in?
[02:42:04.428 --> 02:42:05.849]  You know, I have mixed feelings on Trump.
[02:42:05.949 --> 02:42:08.170]  I'm always very clear about what I think.
[02:42:08.250 --> 02:42:09.831]  I hate the jab part on Trump.
[02:42:09.871 --> 02:42:10.572]  Pushing the jab?
[02:42:11.479 --> 02:42:12.539]  Sorry, I'm not giving you a pass.
[02:42:12.559 --> 02:42:12.799]  Me too.
[02:42:12.859 --> 02:42:14.560]  But he can close the border.
[02:42:15.160 --> 02:42:19.221]  And he did not get us into any wars, which in our economy was smoking.
[02:42:19.321 --> 02:42:20.462]  It was doing good, right?
[02:42:21.002 --> 02:42:22.242]  And so these things were true.
[02:42:23.042 --> 02:42:24.723]  And so do I think Trump could do it?
[02:42:25.203 --> 02:42:28.524]  Well, let's just say I helped them out with information, right?
[02:42:28.624 --> 02:42:29.384]  Yeah, they can do it.
[02:42:29.464 --> 02:42:31.305]  They can close down the Central American border.
[02:42:31.525 --> 02:42:31.986]  No problem.
[02:42:32.206 --> 02:42:32.886]  It's child's play.
[02:42:33.207 --> 02:42:34.748]  It just takes will to do it, right?
[02:42:34.949 --> 02:42:37.771]  First of all, you get rid of all these cabinet members and all these woke people.
[02:42:38.132 --> 02:42:39.933]  You purge the U.S.
[02:42:40.274 --> 02:42:40.674]  Stay there.
[02:42:40.694 --> 02:42:41.695]  You only have the floor.
[02:42:41.755 --> 02:42:46.880]  Michael Young, when we come back, when he leaves, I'm going to talk to Holtman, Cassandra, Steve, and Bart.
[02:42:47.161 --> 02:42:47.601]  Stay there.
[02:42:48.122 --> 02:42:49.963]  But I'm going to come back and tell us about solutions.
[02:42:50.084 --> 02:42:52.766]  Michael Young, the preeminent investigative journalist.
[02:42:52.786 --> 02:42:53.167]  Stay with us.
[02:42:58.123 --> 02:43:02.250]  You know, I sit up here and I yell and scream about the New World Order and the globalists.
[02:43:02.270 --> 02:43:06.376]  They're planning to get rid of the borders and release a virus and have a global power grab.
[02:43:06.416 --> 02:43:07.478]  And you saw it all come true.
[02:43:08.580 --> 02:43:09.321]  But there's a...
[02:43:10.353 --> 02:43:10.953]  We're good to go.
[02:43:35.531 --> 02:43:41.355]  You can get either one of these great items at 40% off individually or together for 50% off.
[02:43:41.655 --> 02:43:45.557]  Now, the time we have left, I can't tell you why they're so great and what they do for your body.
[02:43:45.977 --> 02:43:50.700]  Go to InfoWarsHore.com, look at the ingredients and investigate it, and then get them.
[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.501]  It supports the InfoWar and it'll change your life.
[02:43:54.082 --> 02:43:54.882]  Take advantage now.
[02:43:55.042 --> 02:43:55.783]  InfoWarsHore.com.
[02:43:58.655 --> 02:44:10.458]  We are in the middle of a crude and ugly communist revolution funded by the big banks as a battering ram into a new age digital economy and a total surveillance state.
[02:44:10.918 --> 02:44:16.399]  All branches of government are attacking we the people and they offer us only one option.
[02:44:16.719 --> 02:44:18.920]  A meaningless vote in a rigged election.
[02:44:19.820 --> 02:44:21.661]  What we can do is be prepared.
[02:44:22.141 --> 02:44:30.506]  And you can support the InfoWar by shopping at InfoWarStore.com for products to help you through good times and bad.

[02:44:46.817 --> 02:44:50.442]  Let the world unite for truth, justice, and 1776 worldwide.
[02:44:57.574 --> 02:45:01.318]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[02:45:01.638 --> 02:45:04.801]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[02:45:05.201 --> 02:45:09.665]  Because they can't get through this giant megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[02:45:10.306 --> 02:45:12.428]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[02:45:12.748 --> 02:45:20.736]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's You Will Eat the Bugs.
[02:45:21.356 --> 02:45:22.658]  This is The Great Awakening.

[02:46:35.492 --> 02:46:43.094]  People have reported a reduction in symptoms of insomnia, arthritis, seizures, chronic pain, and epilepsy.
[02:46:43.574 --> 02:46:50.196]  Several studies have shown it helps to reduce cortisol, increase serotonin, and boost vitality.
[02:46:51.096 --> 02:46:54.717]  Order yours today at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:46:58.799 --> 02:47:04.701]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:21.453 --> 02:47:25.855]  Nobody is doing more important work than Michael Young.
[02:47:25.895 --> 02:47:29.656]  And I love Joe Rogan, and he hates it if you recommend guests to a show because everybody does it.
[02:47:30.197 --> 02:47:32.718]  But I recommended Michael Young to him several times.
[02:47:33.258 --> 02:47:35.679]  But at least Brett Weinstein, I know, gets on there a lot.
[02:47:35.879 --> 02:47:37.379]  He can now go on there and talk about this.
[02:47:38.480 --> 02:47:41.541]  But we already know this.
[02:47:41.581 --> 02:47:42.261]  It's all on record.
[02:47:42.301 --> 02:47:47.984]  But the footage can get the public to understand that our government, with the CHICOMs and the U.N.,
[02:47:49.284 --> 02:47:50.344]  There are signs everywhere.
[02:47:50.364 --> 02:47:51.365]  The federal funding's there.
[02:47:51.405 --> 02:47:52.305]  It's all in the records.
[02:47:52.585 --> 02:47:53.645]  They give them debit cards.
[02:47:53.745 --> 02:47:56.286]  It's all run by our criminal government.
[02:47:56.746 --> 02:47:58.407]  And again, Congress knows this.
[02:47:58.467 --> 02:48:00.887]  So Mike Leon is doing God's work here.
[02:48:01.568 --> 02:48:09.910]  In closing, my friend, I want to get Weinstein and others on as soon as they get back and get you in the studio as soon as you're back.
[02:48:10.030 --> 02:48:13.211]  I know you live close to Austin, and we still need to go get dinner together.
[02:48:14.181 --> 02:48:15.581]  And I want to go down there soon as well.
[02:48:15.641 --> 02:48:17.902]  I'm just really tied down here in the wars that are going on.
[02:48:17.922 --> 02:48:20.063]  I'm trying to go to federal court Wednesday.
[02:48:20.103 --> 02:48:21.203]  I'm trying to not do that.
[02:48:21.663 --> 02:48:25.925]  But I'm pinned down here kind of like a general and back at the base.
[02:48:25.965 --> 02:48:27.005]  But I want to be out there with you.
[02:48:27.085 --> 02:48:30.206]  But you got cut off on the break.
[02:48:30.266 --> 02:48:31.226]  What are the solutions?
[02:48:31.667 --> 02:48:32.427]  How do we stop this?
[02:48:33.882 --> 02:48:41.467]  Well, it's extremely important that you come down and take one or two key people with you and I'll make sure everything goes smooth and you're not going to believe what you see.
[02:48:41.487 --> 02:48:43.508]  I know you travel and see a lot of stuff.
[02:48:43.888 --> 02:48:49.912]  This is one of those rare honey holes where you have great access and you're in the middle of everything, right?
[02:48:50.833 --> 02:48:51.373]  What to do?
[02:48:51.613 --> 02:48:53.514]  This is our government that's doing it, period.
[02:48:55.175 --> 02:48:57.777]  We've got to have a president who's going to stand strong.
[02:48:58.277 --> 02:48:58.757]  That's it.
[02:48:58.917 --> 02:49:00.158]  And it can be stopped.
[02:49:00.498 --> 02:49:02.739]  We have to clear out the top ranks of the military.
[02:49:02.799 --> 02:49:03.680]  They've been selected.
[02:49:04.140 --> 02:49:05.100]  They're woke.
[02:49:05.761 --> 02:49:06.641]  I know some of them.
[02:49:06.801 --> 02:49:08.022]  I communicate with some of them.
[02:49:08.302 --> 02:49:09.863]  They will see what I'm saying now.
[02:49:10.443 --> 02:49:12.124]  For some reason, we still communicate.
[02:49:12.444 --> 02:49:13.685]  But they need to be cleared out.
[02:49:14.865 --> 02:49:16.326]  They're part of the problem.
[02:49:16.886 --> 02:49:19.586]  And likewise, we've got people like Mayorkas.
[02:49:19.786 --> 02:49:20.887]  He's a straight-up traitor.
[02:49:21.207 --> 02:49:22.587]  That is absolute treason.
[02:49:22.627 --> 02:49:25.148]  What he's doing, that is the proper word, right?
[02:49:25.528 --> 02:49:26.368]  Same with Blinken.
[02:49:26.668 --> 02:49:27.528]  A long list.
[02:49:27.608 --> 02:49:28.829]  We've got to get rid of them.
[02:49:29.069 --> 02:49:37.351]  They've got to be kicked out of office, and we've got to put, literally, as they used to say, put the adults back in charge when they were putting the children in charge.
[02:49:38.031 --> 02:49:49.464]  We really can stop this, and we really can reverse it, and we really must deport tens of millions of people, and I realize that's going to be dicey, and it's not going to be pretty, and we need to get on with it.
[02:49:49.724 --> 02:49:51.006]  We need to get to work.
[02:49:51.026 --> 02:49:53.809]  But if we don't stop it, what's the master plan?
[02:49:54.329 --> 02:49:55.330]  What do we look like in 3, 5, 10 years?
[02:49:57.011 --> 02:49:57.652]  We will die.
[02:49:58.273 --> 02:49:58.934]  We will die.
[02:49:59.314 --> 02:50:01.177]  They will be kicking the heads down the road.
[02:50:01.217 --> 02:50:09.048]  These high testosterone guys coming across the Darien Gap, they're watching Joe out there smoking dope and not doing anything.
[02:50:09.289 --> 02:50:09.789]  Sorry, Joe.
[02:50:09.829 --> 02:50:11.231]  That's why you never have me on your show.
[02:50:11.512 --> 02:50:12.814]  It's because I say stuff like that.
[02:50:13.194 --> 02:50:20.698]  But when you're out there smoking dope, Joe, and I ask Brett Weinstein the next time he sees you to please ask you to stop smoking dope on your show.
[02:50:21.038 --> 02:50:22.238]  We are in a state of war.
[02:50:22.518 --> 02:50:23.759]  You're around smoking dope.
[02:50:24.159 --> 02:50:30.422]  When these guys come into the Darien Gap, they're going to bust down your door, they're going to cut off your head, and they're going to play soccer with it.
[02:50:30.802 --> 02:50:32.483]  That's the kind of people we're dealing with.
[02:50:32.763 --> 02:50:34.104]  This is no shit, right?
[02:50:34.424 --> 02:50:36.165]  It's time to get man hats on here.
[02:50:36.625 --> 02:50:37.466]  Get serious.
[02:50:37.806 --> 02:50:38.406]  It's on.
[02:50:38.726 --> 02:50:41.968]  By the way, that's some of the footage when you had the muckraker on the show, my show.
[02:50:42.748 --> 02:50:46.913]  There's whole groups of military Islamic men who aren't recruits.
[02:50:46.933 --> 02:50:52.519]  You can tell they're officers wearing the same boots, the same backpacks, not talking to the media, saying no cameras.
[02:50:52.840 --> 02:50:53.520]  You can see it.
[02:50:54.001 --> 02:51:00.108]  It looks like engineering brigades to me who are going to set up the technical operations, set up criminal operations to fund the next group.
[02:51:00.168 --> 02:51:03.352]  They're sending their officer corps in right now.
[02:51:04.755 --> 02:51:04.915]  Yeah.
[02:51:19.795 --> 02:51:20.836]  And another thing is...
[02:51:49.517 --> 02:51:52.659]  Tell people all the time you're not laying around smoking dope.
[02:51:52.879 --> 02:51:57.482]  You're not laying around, you know, wow, this is bad.
[02:51:57.542 --> 02:51:58.863]  No, we've got to do something.
[02:51:58.983 --> 02:52:02.024]  Those are the Syrians that Anthony was faced up.
[02:52:02.304 --> 02:52:03.645]  Anthony could have gotten hurt doing that.
[02:52:03.865 --> 02:52:05.186]  That's right in front of China Camp.
[02:52:05.466 --> 02:52:08.508]  Highest is like 50 meters away from him, 40 meters away.
[02:52:08.788 --> 02:52:13.811]  So that highest office you were showing earlier is on that road, like 40 yards away, right?
[02:52:14.031 --> 02:52:15.612]  They all have the same boots.
[02:52:16.272 --> 02:52:21.755]  You just look at those guys instantly and tell you, I would say that's technical computer engineer group going in.
[02:52:23.696 --> 02:52:24.736]  They're somebody serious.
[02:52:25.136 --> 02:52:27.037]  They had just walked by that fence, right?
[02:52:27.397 --> 02:52:28.418]  And you see it all the time.
[02:52:28.538 --> 02:52:30.819]  I mean, we see it literally many times per day.
[02:52:31.059 --> 02:52:36.742]  And again, Brett Weinstein and Chris Martinson just saw it, and I just messaged to Brett.
[02:52:37.002 --> 02:52:38.603]  Actually, they just responded.
[02:52:38.963 --> 02:52:40.644]  It looks like his son just responded.
[02:52:40.664 --> 02:52:41.464]  He's going to talk with him.
[02:52:42.225 --> 02:52:43.766]  I want to try to get Brett on your show.
[02:52:44.187 --> 02:52:49.653]  And because, you know, let him see it through his, as you know, he's been a very well-known progressive.
[02:52:49.733 --> 02:52:50.854]  You can see he's waking up.
[02:52:51.094 --> 02:52:52.776]  I mean, he can see it this way.
[02:52:52.796 --> 02:52:56.980]  He went on Turner Carlson two weeks ago and said they created the virus.
[02:52:57.001 --> 02:52:57.581]  They released it.
[02:52:57.621 --> 02:52:58.562]  They're setting up world government.
[02:52:58.582 --> 02:52:59.683]  They're getting ready to hit us again.
[02:52:59.703 --> 02:53:00.584]  They want a world treaty.
[02:53:00.985 --> 02:53:02.186]  This is unspeakably bad.
[02:53:02.246 --> 02:53:03.648]  Words cannot describe how evil it is.
[02:53:05.563 --> 02:53:06.604]  He's an intelligent man.
[02:53:06.764 --> 02:53:08.866]  He saw it for what it is.
[02:53:08.886 --> 02:53:11.668]  And we spent a lot of time running around together.
[02:53:11.709 --> 02:53:12.729]  And that's another point.
[02:53:12.769 --> 02:53:14.031]  We're going to find out who's good and bad here.
[02:53:14.051 --> 02:53:18.835]  There have been a lot of people that were deceived, and they're going to flip to our side like Elon Musk and others are right now.
[02:53:19.215 --> 02:53:22.058]  But a lot of people are going to find out we're on the enemy team.
[02:53:23.035 --> 02:53:25.497]  Brett's flipping to the team of truth.
[02:53:25.817 --> 02:53:27.018]  He can see it for what it is.
[02:53:27.839 --> 02:53:36.447]  He clearly thought that a lot of the things that I was saying probably sounded kind of crazy, but I started showing it to him, and he's like, I see it.
[02:53:36.767 --> 02:53:39.189]  It's really, actually, it's worse than you actually.
[02:53:39.990 --> 02:53:40.910]  You know how it is, Alex.
[02:53:41.071 --> 02:53:45.915]  You can say it on your show, and it sounds like hyperbole, but then you take somebody to these places, and they're like,
[02:53:46.235 --> 02:53:46.996]  It's actually worth it.
[02:53:47.016 --> 02:53:51.902]  If you go to the Texas border, video doesn't describe it because video is only one perspective.
[02:53:51.922 --> 02:53:54.265]  When you're there, it's just all around you.
[02:53:54.485 --> 02:53:59.131]  You can't even... There's so many vans and trucks and buses and helicopters and planes taking off.
[02:53:59.412 --> 02:54:01.815]  You're like in Richard Scarry Busytown.
[02:54:02.175 --> 02:54:03.096]  It's like you can't even...
[02:54:05.856 --> 02:54:06.196]  It is.
[02:54:06.676 --> 02:54:07.017]  It is.
[02:54:07.557 --> 02:54:10.118]  And I really desperately want to get you down here, Alex.
[02:54:10.178 --> 02:54:19.523]  It's extremely important because also we all have different perspectives and different backgrounds, and you have a background that's highly informed on this subject.
[02:54:19.863 --> 02:54:25.946]  So you're going to see things, even with all the amount of time I've spent down here, you're going to see things I didn't actually notice yet.
[02:54:26.246 --> 02:54:30.028]  Which is one of the reasons I take key people down here and show them everything.
[02:54:30.368 --> 02:54:41.575]  And then usually about a week or two or three weeks later, a month later, when it really all settles with them and they've had a time to sleep on it, then they start putting pieces together and they start sending me really important messages.
[02:54:41.835 --> 02:54:42.595]  Well, we know what it is.
[02:54:42.675 --> 02:54:49.419]  A global government UN takeover, destroying sovereignty of nations period, run by our own government that set up the UN.
[02:54:49.519 --> 02:54:50.940]  This is the endgame of the New World Order.
[02:54:51.320 --> 02:55:01.222]  Michael Yan, people can find all your amazing work on X, and we really appreciate you, Michael Yan, at Michael underscore Yan on X, MichaelYan.com.
[02:55:02.902 --> 02:55:05.603]  Whoever you want on the show, you tell my producers, load them up.
[02:55:06.983 --> 02:55:07.503]  Thank you, sir.
[02:55:07.823 --> 02:55:09.263]  I'll send some good people your way.
[02:55:09.363 --> 02:55:09.803]  Thank you, sir.
[02:55:09.823 --> 02:55:10.083]  Love you.
[02:55:10.103 --> 02:55:12.024]  All right, folks.
[02:55:12.384 --> 02:55:13.044]  Oh, my God.
[02:55:13.084 --> 02:55:13.884]  It's so frustrating.
[02:55:13.924 --> 02:55:17.165]  Every one time I watch these congressional hearings, not a word about the U.N.
[02:55:17.225 --> 02:55:17.685]  bases.
[02:55:18.700 --> 02:55:19.842]  That's where they bring them to.
[02:55:19.882 --> 02:55:20.863]  That's the springboard.
[02:55:21.303 --> 02:55:24.147]  You take those out by taking the funding out, you beat it.
[02:55:25.129 --> 02:55:28.253]  Instead, we're trying to beat it once it comes into the country.
[02:55:30.416 --> 02:55:33.980]  That's like... This is so frustrating.
[02:55:34.361 --> 02:55:35.022]  We're going to go to break.
[02:55:36.224 --> 02:55:41.506]  And I'm going to take a little bit of Cilente's time, you understand, because I promise I'm going to go to Steve, Bart, Hulkman, and Cassandra.
[02:55:41.526 --> 02:55:43.427]  If I don't do this, we won't be here.
[02:55:43.487 --> 02:55:44.547]  Plus, these are products you need.
[02:55:44.887 --> 02:55:46.068]  Look, I need funds, folks.
[02:55:46.708 --> 02:55:47.749]  You know why I haven't gone down there with him?
[02:55:47.769 --> 02:55:51.870]  Because I can't fund to take a few security guys, and nobody's going to let me go without security.
[02:55:51.890 --> 02:55:52.470]  I've got to have it.
[02:55:52.691 --> 02:55:55.432]  I love to hang my ass out there, but I've got to go with some security.
[02:55:55.632 --> 02:55:56.452]  I don't have money to travel.
[02:55:56.472 --> 02:55:57.372]  I don't have money to do anything.
[02:55:57.712 --> 02:55:58.813]  Now they finally admit the media.
[02:55:59.113 --> 02:55:59.974]  Jones has nothing.
[02:56:00.534 --> 02:56:01.375]  He sold his car.
[02:56:01.415 --> 02:56:02.215]  He sold his guns.
[02:56:03.316 --> 02:56:04.717]  Like, I give a damn about any of that.
[02:56:04.997 --> 02:56:08.980]  I care about the truth and justice, but I need funds.
[02:56:09.320 --> 02:56:10.581]  InfoWars needs funds.
[02:56:11.202 --> 02:56:11.522]  Okay?
[02:56:12.202 --> 02:56:19.588]  So, if you want to keep us on air and see us go everywhere, like we did at Bilderberg and Davos before and everything else,
[02:56:20.731 --> 02:56:21.151]  We're good to go.
[02:56:44.700 --> 02:56:46.801]  I want to attack in the InfoWar.
[02:56:46.901 --> 02:56:48.363]  I want to go for their juggler.
[02:56:48.823 --> 02:56:52.566]  But if you don't give the pit bull water and food, he's going to be dead.
[02:56:53.206 --> 02:56:54.047]  So I'm not bitching.
[02:56:55.648 --> 02:56:58.090]  Just get products you need at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:56:58.311 --> 02:57:00.072]  And most of the products I get no money from.
[02:57:00.112 --> 02:57:04.576]  But my book, The Great Awakening, we have a signed copy that's a fundraiser.
[02:57:04.596 --> 02:57:05.977]  The unsigned, I get some of the money.
[02:57:06.617 --> 02:57:08.099]  The platinum products that are amazing.
[02:57:09.420 --> 02:57:10.440]  HH Max Boost.
[02:57:12.202 --> 02:57:15.206]  And 1776 testosterone boost and pain MD.
[02:57:15.487 --> 02:57:16.388]  They're amazing products.
[02:57:16.848 --> 02:57:23.737]  I'm not going to go into the bankruptcy and why it happened, but when I sold my house, the court let me put some of my money in to buy products that I could get some of the money back myself.
[02:57:23.757 --> 02:57:26.181]  So I put my own money in to get these because I know they're great.
[02:57:26.721 --> 02:57:27.282]  And it funds us.
[02:57:27.422 --> 02:57:28.484]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:57:29.565 --> 02:57:31.306]  And HGH Max boost is almost sold out.
[02:57:31.366 --> 02:57:32.666]  Despite that, it's still on sale.
[02:57:32.986 --> 02:57:33.987]  Painting these is amazing.
[02:57:34.007 --> 02:57:35.807]  7076 is a toss-around boost.
[02:57:35.827 --> 02:57:36.287]  It's amazing.
[02:57:36.628 --> 02:57:38.288]  And the Boat of the Great Awakening is powerful as well.
[02:57:38.608 --> 02:57:39.549]  But I need your support.
[02:57:39.909 --> 02:57:41.769]  Please go to InfoWarsStore.com and get them right now.
[02:57:42.130 --> 02:57:42.730]  We'll be right back.

[02:57:47.816 --> 02:57:52.039]  The Second American Revolution is happening now right in front of you.
[02:57:52.359 --> 02:57:56.723]  And you're tuned in to InfoWars because you're either looking for the truth or you're already a patriot.

[02:58:06.530 --> 02:58:07.030]  We're good to go.
[02:58:24.480 --> 02:58:25.701]  In our victory against these tyrants.
[02:58:25.981 --> 02:58:27.562]  But now is the time to make the decision.
[02:58:28.123 --> 02:58:32.906]  I know there's millions of forms of media out there and all this BS, and the globalists hope you get lost in all of it.
[02:58:33.266 --> 02:58:37.890]  But notice the globalists, the New World Order, are coming after us because they realize we've got their number.
[02:58:38.810 --> 02:58:39.271]  Think about it.
[02:58:39.631 --> 02:58:40.932]  InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[02:58:40.952 --> 02:58:44.414]  If you want to support the tip of the spear, that decision is up to you.
[02:58:44.715 --> 02:58:46.236]  Please support us now at InfoWars.com.

[03:00:03.118 --> 03:00:07.682]  Gerald Cilente is coming up in just a few minutes, but I promise to go to your calls, and I appreciate you holding.
[03:00:07.722 --> 03:00:12.026]  On this live, Monday, January 22nd, 2024 transmission.
[03:00:12.066 --> 03:00:13.827]  Bart in Georgia, you're on the air.
[03:00:13.867 --> 03:00:14.448]  Thanks for holding.
[03:00:15.869 --> 03:00:18.191]  Yeah, so I'm thinking about this coffee.
[03:00:19.052 --> 03:00:21.314]  The WEF wants to cut off our coffee.
[03:00:21.374 --> 03:00:24.236]  Well, I buy my coffee by the year.
[03:00:24.517 --> 03:00:28.080]  Don't buy just a bag of Alex Jones' Wake Up America.
[03:00:29.080 --> 03:00:30.662]  Buy it by the year, and I...
[03:00:31.328 --> 03:00:32.830]  I got one more thing to say, Alex.
[03:00:33.752 --> 03:00:41.304]  Have you considered Alex Jones' cartoon, Get to These Kids and Counteract Drag Queen Storytime?
[03:00:41.584 --> 03:00:43.868]  These little kids will be begging their parents
[03:00:44.568 --> 03:00:44.788]  Bye.
[03:00:44.988 --> 03:00:46.248]  Alex Jones Serial.
[03:00:47.749 --> 03:01:00.692]  Listen, you know what conservatives and Christians and populists should do is set up 1776 Christian clubs because if they're going to let Satanists into the schools to have Satan hour, no one's going to want to go to that except their pedo parents.
[03:01:01.172 --> 03:01:02.192]  And I never got to that today.
[03:01:02.232 --> 03:01:02.572]  I meant to.
[03:01:02.592 --> 03:01:03.593]  There's a bunch of news on that.
[03:01:04.093 --> 03:01:09.274]  We should have 1776 and Christian clubs because you can't have a state-run school
[03:01:10.134 --> 03:01:11.075]  It's officially Christian.
[03:01:11.355 --> 03:01:12.836]  But Christians can have their own clubs.
[03:01:13.136 --> 03:01:15.437]  So the answer is Christians need to set up clubs.
[03:01:16.318 --> 03:01:19.320]  And we need to have 1776 civics clubs.
[03:01:20.160 --> 03:01:21.081]  That's a great idea.
[03:01:21.201 --> 03:01:25.343]  And yeah, people like Alex Jones, they should set up Infowars clubs in the schools.
[03:01:25.844 --> 03:01:33.669]  They've got federal programs teaching elementary students and middle school students how bad Alex Jones is, which they don't know reverse psychology.
[03:01:33.689 --> 03:01:35.130]  They'll just make the kids want to go look us up.
[03:01:35.170 --> 03:01:36.751]  But that's a great point, sir.
[03:01:36.771 --> 03:01:37.191]  Anything else?
[03:01:38.499 --> 03:01:40.019]  Yeah, I just want everybody to go.
[03:01:40.079 --> 03:01:48.761]  I put up the Alex Jones Show on the Bart Fine channel on Rumble and Biscuit, and just watch the Alex Jones Show on the Bart Fine channel, please.
[03:01:49.821 --> 03:01:50.882]  And your phone's ringing a little bit.
[03:01:50.902 --> 03:01:51.722]  What's the name of the channel?
[03:01:52.762 --> 03:01:55.142]  Bart Fine on Rumble and Biscuit.
[03:01:55.523 --> 03:01:56.723]  All right, thank you so much, sir.
[03:01:57.123 --> 03:01:57.943]  Bart's Fine.
[03:01:58.623 --> 03:02:01.564]  Let's talk to Cassandra in California, then Steve in Hulkman.
[03:02:01.624 --> 03:02:02.444]  Cassandra, go ahead.
[03:02:03.618 --> 03:02:04.499]  Hi, Alex.
[03:02:04.659 --> 03:02:06.781]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:02:07.922 --> 03:02:09.724]  I'm calling about Michael Yon.
[03:02:10.105 --> 03:02:26.702]  He has been spot on for years, and I was telling your producer there about maybe another solution is setting up a Teletron, having Michael Yon's videos of what's going on down in Panama.
[03:02:27.483 --> 03:02:28.064]  Oh, yeah.
[03:02:28.104 --> 03:02:34.610]  Somebody needs to finance just five-minute rotating videos on those panel trucks to park out front to Congress.
[03:02:35.932 --> 03:02:36.172]  Yes.
[03:02:36.572 --> 03:02:37.473]  How about Congress?
[03:02:37.513 --> 03:02:40.336]  How about these congressmen that are sitting there shut the border?
[03:02:40.637 --> 03:02:42.338]  Why don't we make them pay for it?
[03:02:42.498 --> 03:02:45.001]  And again, you don't shut the border at the border.
[03:02:45.321 --> 03:02:48.445]  You shut it when your own government's funding it with UN camps.
[03:02:49.420 --> 03:02:51.962]  Well, a lot of people don't realize that.
[03:02:52.002 --> 03:02:53.863]  And another thing, people are waking up.
[03:02:53.963 --> 03:03:07.271]  I take my phone, and as I'm shopping and stuff, especially in the produce section, I have your program on and various other programs, and people stop me and ask me who I'm listening to.
[03:03:07.291 --> 03:03:09.853]  Oh, yeah, people are really interested in freedom.
[03:03:10.706 --> 03:03:11.046]  Oh, yeah.
[03:03:11.367 --> 03:03:15.489]  And the cashier at my local grocery store, oh, you're listening to Alex?
[03:03:15.570 --> 03:03:17.531]  I go, yeah, you know him?
[03:03:18.692 --> 03:03:23.695]  So people know you, and I'm in a little small town in Southern California, but it's growing really fast.
[03:03:24.536 --> 03:03:32.842]  Well, that's why you should wear a T-shirt or play my show or other shows, because you find out really black people, old people, young people, you find out how popular freedom is.
[03:03:32.862 --> 03:03:34.063]  You're like, wow, we're not alone here.
[03:03:34.858 --> 03:03:35.879]  No, we're not alone.
[03:03:36.099 --> 03:03:41.863]  We have a little patriot parade of cars every two weeks that goes through here.
[03:03:41.883 --> 03:03:45.606]  Well, we've got to show our numbers.
[03:03:45.626 --> 03:03:47.988]  That's why I tell the story all the time, not to say, oh, I'm popular.
[03:03:48.008 --> 03:03:51.550]  No, no, I'm saying most people aren't known, so you don't know how popular freedom is.
[03:03:51.951 --> 03:03:53.352]  I get nothing but love now everywhere.
[03:03:53.812 --> 03:03:56.834]  I mean, I literally go to restaurants and say, can I sit in the back corner?
[03:03:57.254 --> 03:03:58.415]  Still, 20 people come over.
[03:03:58.815 --> 03:03:59.855]  And again, it's not about me.
[03:03:59.915 --> 03:04:00.936]  It's that freedom is popular.
[03:04:00.956 --> 03:04:01.976]  They go, oh, that's Alex Jones.
[03:04:02.297 --> 03:04:02.937]  It's not about me.
[03:04:02.997 --> 03:04:05.418]  It's showing they see a mirror of who they are.
[03:04:05.738 --> 03:04:07.539]  We don't realize how strong we are.
[03:04:09.140 --> 03:04:10.481]  Exactly.
[03:04:10.521 --> 03:04:15.264]  Well, I'm waiting for my T-shirt from you and...
[03:04:16.570 --> 03:04:17.030]  Must.
[03:04:17.291 --> 03:04:17.631]  Elon.
[03:04:18.151 --> 03:04:22.154]  By the way, by the way, for some reason, we ordered a month ago, Christmas, a week behind.
[03:04:22.254 --> 03:04:22.854]  It is in.
[03:04:23.254 --> 03:04:24.615]  It arrived yesterday.
[03:04:24.695 --> 03:04:25.716]  It's now shipping.
[03:04:26.036 --> 03:04:27.797]  The Team Humanities, because I told them, I said, wear it.
[03:04:27.817 --> 03:04:29.138]  They go, well, it's in Denver at the warehouse.
[03:04:29.198 --> 03:04:30.159]  I went, well, get me one.
[03:04:30.579 --> 03:04:32.260]  Just today, I'm like, get me the shirt now.
[03:04:32.300 --> 03:04:32.881]  I want to wear it.
[03:04:33.181 --> 03:04:34.041]  So thank you so much.
[03:04:34.101 --> 03:04:35.062]  I really appreciate you.
[03:04:35.082 --> 03:04:36.283]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[03:04:37.143 --> 03:04:39.985]  Back in 60 seconds, I'm going to go to Steven, Indiana, quickly, and then Hulk, man.
[03:04:40.926 --> 03:04:42.507]  Then we're going to skip both network breaks.
[03:04:43.717 --> 03:04:45.881]  So Gerald Salente doesn't just get his time back, he gets more.
[03:04:46.542 --> 03:04:51.971]  It's only like four or five minutes on calls, and then Gerald Salente, the top trends forecaster, takes over.
[03:04:51.991 --> 03:04:52.613]  Want to support us?
[03:04:52.953 --> 03:04:56.700]  The discount is Amazing Magazine at his site.
[03:04:58.459 --> 03:05:04.865]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the globalist agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[03:05:04.925 --> 03:05:19.217]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections masquerading as vaccines.
[03:05:19.377 --> 03:05:24.282]  It is so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives oblivious.
[03:05:25.669 --> 03:05:28.385]  And you realize, ignorance is not bliss, it equals death.
[03:05:30.011 --> 03:05:50.459]  But people are starting to really understand how serious things are and that's a hard thing to do because to wake up to a discovered reality and realize that we're in the middle of a giant biological weapons war against humanity and that there's mass sterilization that's already taking place and they're cutting off all the major energy sources is really hard to deal with, but it's the reality.
[03:05:51.019 --> 03:05:53.080]  Facing it is our only chance to turn this around.
[03:05:53.500 --> 03:05:55.200]  This stuff's about to get really, really nasty.
[03:05:55.601 --> 03:05:56.241]  Infowars.com
[03:06:00.511 --> 03:06:01.351]  You found it.
[03:06:01.671 --> 03:06:03.172]  The tip of the spear.
[03:06:03.692 --> 03:06:06.153]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:07.114 --> 03:06:13.717]  I hear people talking right about the way we have to live here in this country.
[03:06:15.987 --> 03:06:22.969]  Harping on wars, we fight and griping about the way things ought to be.
[03:06:23.369 --> 03:06:29.370]  And I don't mind them switching sides and standing up to things they believe in.
[03:06:29.390 --> 03:06:36.452]  When they're running down my country, man, they're walking on the fight beside me.
[03:06:36.552 --> 03:06:38.612]  Yeah!
[03:06:38.772 --> 03:06:40.853]  Steve in Indiana, you're on the air.
[03:06:41.033 --> 03:06:41.493]  Go ahead.
[03:06:41.553 --> 03:06:41.933]  Welcome.
[03:06:41.953 --> 03:06:43.433]  Hey, Alex.
[03:06:43.453 --> 03:06:44.474]  How are you doing today, sir?
[03:06:44.514 --> 03:06:44.874]  Good, brother.
[03:06:44.914 --> 03:06:45.394]  Thanks for calling.
[03:06:46.405 --> 03:06:48.988]  Hey, number one, I just want to say it's an honor to speak to you.
[03:06:49.169 --> 03:06:51.812]  I'm shaking as I'm speaking to you, but I'm a little nervous.
[03:06:51.872 --> 03:06:53.054]  Well, I love you, man.
[03:06:53.735 --> 03:06:58.360]  I want to encourage you because, number one, you put everything on the line for us, for all of us.
[03:06:58.581 --> 03:07:03.247]  And the message, the gentleman I called earlier, Jimmy, this is what prompted me to call in.
[03:07:03.871 --> 03:07:04.472]  We're good to go.
[03:07:25.365 --> 03:07:28.288]  Well, my issue was he said, you're not calling for violence.
[03:07:28.308 --> 03:07:31.991]  And then I said, well, then who are we supposed to attack?
[03:07:32.011 --> 03:07:34.553]  And he said, I'm not going to answer that.
[03:07:49.409 --> 03:07:55.634]  I really don't think violence is the answer because they're just going to spin it around.
[03:07:56.154 --> 03:08:03.059]  It's a cultural change in saying, no, that's where most good revolutions come out of a cultural revolution.
[03:08:03.079 --> 03:08:04.020]  You're absolutely right.
[03:08:04.100 --> 03:08:07.142]  It's like Gandhi proved that point.
[03:08:07.162 --> 03:08:08.863]  I'm not saying I support Gandhi.
[03:08:08.883 --> 03:08:10.684]  I'm just saying you can do a lot more.
[03:08:10.984 --> 03:08:13.566]  Gandhi wasn't perfect, but he was right.
[03:08:13.606 --> 03:08:14.447]  The way he did it was good.
[03:08:14.827 --> 03:08:15.087]  Yes.
[03:08:15.448 --> 03:08:15.848]  Oh, yes.
[03:08:15.948 --> 03:08:17.930]  And cooler heads will prevail.
[03:08:18.070 --> 03:08:21.813]  And by the way, I don't know if Gandhi was wrong about the British Empire.
[03:08:22.093 --> 03:08:27.018]  He was pro-Islamic and allowed an invasion of their country, and they almost lost their country.
[03:08:27.598 --> 03:08:30.160]  And now that's caused the backlash with Modi and the rest of it.
[03:08:30.300 --> 03:08:30.681]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:08:31.758 --> 03:08:40.160]  Well, you know, with all this right now, especially with the World Economic Forum, you know, getting together here last week, you know, they want us to be spoon-fed.
[03:08:40.280 --> 03:08:46.341]  And anybody that has, you know, even a third-grade education understands what we're up against right now.
[03:08:46.822 --> 03:08:49.482]  Information is being fed to us that is propaganda.
[03:08:49.662 --> 03:08:53.943]  It's meant for us to just stay silent and not do anything, just like Jimmy wants to do.
[03:08:53.963 --> 03:08:55.003]  And it's okay.
[03:08:55.364 --> 03:08:56.884]  You know, this is what I tell those kind of people.
[03:08:57.995 --> 03:08:58.676]  No, no, I totally...
[03:09:23.977 --> 03:09:24.918]  I totally agree with you.
[03:09:24.958 --> 03:09:27.601]  And look, violence is the last resort.
[03:09:28.262 --> 03:09:30.044]  And if you need to use it, you need to know how to do it.
[03:09:30.805 --> 03:09:35.470]  So I know how to hit somebody over the head with a baseball bat or shoot somebody at 500 yards with a rifle.
[03:09:35.991 --> 03:09:38.013]  Or shoot somebody 10 feet away with a shotgun.
[03:09:38.413 --> 03:09:40.295]  I'm trying to live a life where I don't have to do that.
[03:09:41.256 --> 03:09:43.137]  Anybody that just says, oh, I'm going to wait for the U.N.
[03:09:43.157 --> 03:09:45.559]  troops to come, they're not going to come that way, folks.
[03:09:45.579 --> 03:09:48.460]  They're coming with inflation and open borders and fentanyl deaths.
[03:09:48.501 --> 03:09:49.061]  Thanks for the call.
[03:09:49.501 --> 03:09:51.222]  All right, Gerald's about to take over in two minutes.
[03:09:51.242 --> 03:09:53.784]  But first, Hulk, man, you're our tail gunner from New York.
[03:09:53.824 --> 03:09:54.184]  Go ahead.
[03:09:55.545 --> 03:09:57.526]  Yeah, we don't need violence, but we need justice.
[03:09:57.566 --> 03:09:58.726]  That's what we need.
[03:09:58.987 --> 03:10:02.869]  And we have to form an anti-tyranny task force.
[03:10:03.579 --> 03:10:05.560]  And go to all 50 states.
[03:10:05.700 --> 03:10:12.323]  I suggest using the soldiers that signed that petition for accountability for the poison death shots that were rolled out.
[03:10:12.823 --> 03:10:14.544]  We have the crime.
[03:10:15.104 --> 03:10:16.125]  We have the evidence.
[03:10:16.445 --> 03:10:17.445]  We have the criminals.
[03:10:17.966 --> 03:10:20.867]  Now we just have to form an anti-tyranny task force.
[03:10:21.354 --> 03:10:27.980]  And all of them have to sign sworn affidavits just on what transpired during the COVID-19 pandemic.
[03:10:28.060 --> 03:10:33.644]  No, I agree with you that it's duty that once we take the country back, we have a Nuremberg 2.
[03:10:33.865 --> 03:10:34.805]  Oh, right now.
[03:10:34.825 --> 03:10:36.006]  Right now.
[03:10:36.087 --> 03:10:36.667]  We can't wait.
[03:10:36.967 --> 03:10:37.548]  We can't wait.
[03:10:37.668 --> 03:10:38.048]  It's done.
[03:10:38.128 --> 03:10:38.428]  It's over.
[03:10:38.509 --> 03:10:39.349]  The evidence is out there.
[03:10:39.369 --> 03:10:40.210]  We have to save lives.
[03:10:40.290 --> 03:10:42.252]  Kids in college are still being forced to take this.
[03:10:42.612 --> 03:10:46.075]  There's people that are still brainwashed and they're still going along with this protocol of death.
[03:10:46.468 --> 03:10:47.669]  We have no more time, sir.
[03:10:47.929 --> 03:10:48.869]  This has to happen now.
[03:10:48.889 --> 03:10:49.369]  No, you're right.
[03:10:49.509 --> 03:10:57.453]  I am not for offensive violence, but them pushing the shots, they're attacking us, and so they're really crossing the Rubicon there.
[03:10:57.513 --> 03:10:59.074]  They crossed it legally and lawfully.
[03:10:59.114 --> 03:11:01.475]  They all have to sign sworn affidavits at this point.
[03:11:01.495 --> 03:11:03.256]  The crime is already out there.
[03:11:03.516 --> 03:11:07.198]  They instituted the Variety Authorization Act under false pretense.
[03:11:07.600 --> 03:11:09.161]  All right, Hulk, man, I appreciate your call.
[03:11:09.181 --> 03:11:09.821]  I'm out of time.
[03:11:09.861 --> 03:11:10.861]  Call me back.
[03:11:10.921 --> 03:11:14.683]  All right, skipping the network break, Cheryl, so they get their time back with Great Trends Forecaster.
[03:11:36.400 --> 03:11:37.680]  Thank you so much, Gerald Cilente.
[03:11:37.720 --> 03:11:38.721]  Tell us what's breaking.
[03:11:40.361 --> 03:11:45.983]  What's breaking is World War III and what's going on.
[03:11:46.043 --> 03:11:50.004]  I mean, people have no idea about it and how serious this is.
[03:11:50.024 --> 03:11:51.885]  The Israel war keeps expanding.
[03:11:52.765 --> 03:11:54.005]  Bombs away in Lebanon.
[03:11:54.045 --> 03:11:55.486]  Bombs away in Syria.
[03:11:57.006 --> 03:12:00.307]  Bombs away knocking out Iranians.
[03:12:01.067 --> 03:12:03.108]  United States bombing Yemen.
[03:12:03.607 --> 03:12:04.368]  Totally against.
[03:12:04.488 --> 03:12:05.068]  Totally against.
[03:12:05.088 --> 03:12:06.489]  You're talking about the Constitution.
[03:12:06.809 --> 03:12:07.630]  What Constitution?
[03:12:07.650 --> 03:12:08.490]  It's a piece of crap.
[03:12:08.550 --> 03:12:09.150]  Throw it away.
[03:12:09.571 --> 03:12:10.191]  I'm in charge.
[03:12:10.251 --> 03:12:10.992]  I'm the president.
[03:12:11.632 --> 03:12:12.172]  I'm Biden.
[03:12:12.212 --> 03:12:13.593]  I'll bomb anybody I want.
[03:12:14.074 --> 03:12:14.974]  Screw the Congress.
[03:12:15.454 --> 03:12:16.575]  Screw everybody else.
[03:12:17.816 --> 03:12:18.616]  I'll do what I want.
[03:12:18.776 --> 03:12:19.757]  Doesn't mean anything.
[03:12:20.357 --> 03:12:22.038]  And, you know, InfoWars.
[03:12:22.078 --> 03:12:23.659]  I go in InfoWars every day.
[03:12:23.760 --> 03:12:25.160]  We travel the world, by the way.
[03:12:25.641 --> 03:12:28.783]  So when I talk about what's going on in Israel, we go to the Jerusalem Post.
[03:12:28.903 --> 03:12:30.664]  Ah, that's Times of Israel.
[03:12:31.457 --> 03:12:35.378]  We go to the Iranian newspapers, ISNA, RNA, Tehran News.
[03:12:35.918 --> 03:12:37.018]  We go to Al Jazeera.
[03:12:37.058 --> 03:12:38.118]  We follow the news.
[03:12:38.498 --> 03:12:39.939]  We want to see what everybody's saying.
[03:12:40.019 --> 03:12:42.019]  So Infowars is one of them.
[03:12:42.479 --> 03:12:58.762]  And going back to what the speakers, some of the people we're just on now talking about, about the importance of Infowars, what they're putting out and what we put out in the Trends Journal, giving you information when we're being silenced.
[03:12:59.770 --> 03:13:03.351]  So at Davos, the Davos gang, what a freak show.
[03:13:03.391 --> 03:13:04.251]  What a freak show.
[03:13:04.991 --> 03:13:09.312]  Oh, and by the way, one of the earlier callers, a woman, talked about Congress.
[03:13:11.572 --> 03:13:12.872]  C-O-N-G-R-A-S-S.
[03:13:14.013 --> 03:13:14.893]  Congress.
[03:13:16.353 --> 03:13:17.233]  Yeah, A-S-S.
[03:13:26.963 --> 03:13:31.727]  Look at the little stupid freaks telling the people what to do.
[03:13:31.747 --> 03:13:33.749]  Oh, before we're talking about fighting.
[03:13:34.089 --> 03:13:36.971]  Yeah, I'm a warrior for the Prince of Peace.
[03:13:38.072 --> 03:13:39.533]  I want everything peaceful.
[03:13:40.254 --> 03:13:41.254]  I'm like Alex.
[03:13:43.636 --> 03:13:44.577]  Attack the attacker.
[03:13:44.597 --> 03:13:46.879]  The only time you get in a fight...
[03:13:47.671 --> 03:13:50.673]  And, you know, I taught close combat for a number of years.
[03:13:50.693 --> 03:13:52.295]  You know, I'm a real fighter.
[03:13:52.315 --> 03:13:55.597]  Monopoly Donald, born in the Bronx, born to be free.
[03:13:57.259 --> 03:14:01.302]  1946, at the height of American spirit, right after World War II.
[03:14:01.942 --> 03:14:03.744]  Everybody, boy, it was great.
[03:14:03.904 --> 03:14:05.765]  And now it's a freak show.
[03:14:05.825 --> 03:14:07.066]  So going back to the fight.
[03:14:07.527 --> 03:14:12.211]  Congress, we're in charge.
[03:14:13.391 --> 03:14:15.153]  The people better get that in their head.
[03:14:16.076 --> 03:14:22.140]  All these little clown boys and clown girls are nothing more than public servants.
[03:14:22.681 --> 03:14:23.021]  Got it?
[03:14:24.222 --> 03:14:24.562]  Got it?
[03:14:26.723 --> 03:14:33.208]  How could you be so stupid to swallow the crap spewing out of their mouths?
[03:14:33.988 --> 03:14:35.730]  How dumb could you be?
[03:14:37.211 --> 03:14:38.451]  Oh, I'm a repulsive kid.
[03:14:38.872 --> 03:14:39.872]  I'm a Democrat.
[03:14:40.713 --> 03:14:41.654]  You're out of your mind.
[03:14:41.714 --> 03:14:43.055]  It's a crime syndicate.
[03:14:43.775 --> 03:14:45.056]  By the deeds you shall know them.
[03:14:45.894 --> 03:14:59.039]  So, going back to InfoWars, going back to Davos, they had this new woman on there that just became the chief over there, the editor-in-chief of the Wall Street Journal.
[03:15:00.420 --> 03:15:14.786]  I take out the word Wall Street, and I put in another word that begins with an S and an H. This is a... They brought her over from the UK, which you could put an F and a C in that, too.
[03:15:15.902 --> 03:15:17.083]  Because that's all it is.
[03:15:18.584 --> 03:15:32.635]  She's quoted as saying, not the exact language, and this wasn't in InfoWars, but I'm going to get to the InfoWars article, that we're going to publish what the people want to hear.
[03:15:32.655 --> 03:15:38.479]  Hey, I'm spending $5 a day for this thing.
[03:15:40.581 --> 03:15:41.521]  $5 a day.
[03:15:41.581 --> 03:15:43.023]  No, not what I want to hear.
[03:15:43.283 --> 03:15:43.443]  Hey,
[03:15:44.079 --> 03:15:45.120]  Could you get this in your head?
[03:15:45.720 --> 03:15:47.641]  I'm looking for financial data.
[03:15:48.801 --> 03:15:49.161]  That's it.
[03:15:49.682 --> 03:15:50.862]  Wall Street Journal?
[03:15:50.922 --> 03:15:51.622]  Wall Street?
[03:15:52.083 --> 03:15:52.283]  Yeah.
[03:15:54.944 --> 03:15:55.444]  The street?
[03:15:55.804 --> 03:15:56.265]  The gang?
[03:15:56.305 --> 03:15:57.285]  The white shoe boys?
[03:15:57.545 --> 03:15:57.745]  Yeah.
[03:15:57.945 --> 03:15:59.126]  I want to know what's going on.
[03:15:59.706 --> 03:16:07.710]  I want all the data, all the data I can get on financial, you know, what's going on in nations.
[03:16:08.670 --> 03:16:09.811]  I want to know all about this.
[03:16:10.231 --> 03:16:12.332]  Now, we're going to give you what you want.
[03:16:13.857 --> 03:16:20.880]  So, again, you go to Jonestrends.com and you get a break on the Trends Journal.
[03:16:21.100 --> 03:16:22.840]  This is $5 a day.
[03:16:22.860 --> 03:16:26.822]  The Trends Journal is going to cost you about $2.50 a week.
[03:16:27.502 --> 03:16:30.923]  And you're getting what you're not getting anywhere else in the world, not even close.
[03:16:31.163 --> 03:16:32.264]  If you could show me, let me know.
[03:16:32.624 --> 03:16:37.065]  So going back to the clown lady running the show now, I'm the editor-in-chief.
[03:16:37.445 --> 03:16:39.126]  You do what I say.
[03:16:39.566 --> 03:16:41.127]  They brought me in from the U.K.,
[03:16:43.584 --> 03:16:43.844]  Ready?
[03:16:45.484 --> 03:16:51.566]  This is the front page of Saturday's Wall Street Journal.
[03:16:54.286 --> 03:16:56.927]  Orthodox Christians take plunge of faith.
[03:16:57.787 --> 03:16:58.867]  Baptism of ice.
[03:16:58.887 --> 03:17:07.469]  A man takes a dip in frigid water, symbolizing the baptism of Christ during the Orthodox Christian feast.
[03:17:08.729 --> 03:17:09.930]  What the hell do I want to hear about?
[03:17:11.290 --> 03:17:12.050]  What do I want to hear about?
[03:17:15.384 --> 03:17:18.025]  New Hampshire independents are Haley's last-ditch hope.
[03:17:23.326 --> 03:17:23.626]  Nothing.
[03:17:27.987 --> 03:17:32.248]  Go to this Wall Street Journal.
[03:17:33.248 --> 03:17:34.468]  Oh, I was wrong.
[03:17:35.909 --> 03:17:41.150]  Saturday's paper, $6.
[03:17:41.190 --> 03:17:41.150]  $6.
[03:17:41.330 --> 03:17:45.031]  I didn't get one article from here that was trend-worthy.
[03:17:47.827 --> 03:17:51.869]  They do a report on what the markets did.
[03:17:53.469 --> 03:17:53.649]  Right?
[03:17:58.392 --> 03:18:00.853]  Not one word, not one word.
[03:18:01.213 --> 03:18:02.873]  Hey, what did the markets do over in the EU?
[03:18:02.893 --> 03:18:04.334]  F you, what EU?
[03:18:04.374 --> 03:18:07.615]  Hey, what did they do over in Asia?
[03:18:07.675 --> 03:18:08.356]  What's Asia?
[03:18:10.297 --> 03:18:10.597]  Nothing.
[03:18:11.337 --> 03:18:11.597]  Nothing.
[03:18:12.718 --> 03:18:15.699]  So, going back to the article, because all things are connected.
[03:18:16.476 --> 03:18:17.996]  Like the blood which unites us all said.
[03:18:19.517 --> 03:18:26.998]  Chief Seattle, in InfoWars, this arrogant lady, we owned the media.
[03:18:28.759 --> 03:18:34.320]  Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief laments death to public trust in mainstream media.
[03:18:34.340 --> 03:18:39.181]  If you go back not too long ago, we own the media.
[03:18:40.062 --> 03:18:41.822]  We are the gatekeepers!
[03:18:46.749 --> 03:18:46.949]  Yep.
[03:18:49.950 --> 03:18:52.991]  And we much owned the facts as well.
[03:18:53.011 --> 03:18:55.392]  Hey, fuck you!
[03:18:57.033 --> 03:18:58.233]  Fuck you!
[03:18:59.393 --> 03:19:01.514]  What facts you talking about?
[03:19:03.035 --> 03:19:06.716]  The crap that you make up that the gang sends you?
[03:19:07.936 --> 03:19:09.477]  We own the media.
[03:19:10.037 --> 03:19:11.878]  We'll tell you what to do.
[03:19:12.998 --> 03:19:14.999]  You're just a piece of crap.
[03:19:16.286 --> 03:19:16.707]  Hey!
[03:19:17.387 --> 03:19:20.009]  I'm the editor-in-chief and how much money I make?
[03:19:20.029 --> 03:19:20.069]  No.
[03:19:21.389 --> 03:19:23.191]  You know who you are?
[03:19:23.811 --> 03:19:25.952]  You're a bunch of prostitutes.
[03:19:26.853 --> 03:19:34.337]  You're media whores that get paid to put out by the corporate pimps and your government whoremasters.
[03:19:34.917 --> 03:19:40.321]  Oh, and by the way, I was corrected for using the title prostitutes.
[03:19:41.541 --> 03:19:42.442]  They contributed to
[03:19:43.579 --> 03:19:44.320]  Occupy Peace.
[03:19:44.860 --> 03:19:47.702]  And again, I'm a warrior for the Prince of Peace, so I launched Occupy Peace.
[03:19:49.863 --> 03:19:56.467]  She wrote me from Oklahoma, very generous in donation, that I misused the title prostitute.
[03:19:58.369 --> 03:20:03.092]  Because a prostitute, you pay the money and you get something back.
[03:20:06.214 --> 03:20:07.935]  You get nothing from prostitutes.
[03:20:07.995 --> 03:20:08.895]  The arrogance.
[03:20:09.256 --> 03:20:10.156]  The arrogance.
[03:20:11.597 --> 03:20:12.618]  But to make it clear,
[03:20:18.260 --> 03:20:19.401]  We're the gatekeepers.
[03:20:20.041 --> 03:20:20.901]  Oh, yeah!
[03:20:21.462 --> 03:20:25.544]  You're the slime balls that lied us into the Iraq War.
[03:20:26.324 --> 03:20:28.826]  You sold the crap of the Afghan War.
[03:20:29.386 --> 03:20:31.467]  Oh, I grew up during the Vietnam War.
[03:20:32.228 --> 03:20:38.451]  Gatekeepers, prostitutes, you opened the gate to bend over.
[03:20:38.491 --> 03:20:39.331]  You got it?
[03:20:43.354 --> 03:20:45.435]  Again, that's why you read InfoWars.
[03:20:45.535 --> 03:20:45.735]  So,
[03:20:47.875 --> 03:20:48.935]  It just keeps getting worse.
[03:20:50.096 --> 03:20:55.979]  You got that Ursula von der Leyen, her speech at Davos.
[03:20:58.740 --> 03:20:59.820]  The number one threat.
[03:21:01.761 --> 03:21:03.842]  The number one threat.
[03:21:04.282 --> 03:21:05.203]  Von der Leyen.
[03:21:05.303 --> 03:21:07.424]  Von the lying piece of crap.
[03:21:07.864 --> 03:21:10.565]  A little warmongering lady, by the way.
[03:21:11.025 --> 03:21:12.486]  Oh, yeah, that's right.
[03:21:13.686 --> 03:21:16.908]  You still got that German Nazi blood in you, don't you, huh?
[03:21:18.408 --> 03:21:19.429]  Loves the wars!
[03:21:19.649 --> 03:21:20.470]  Loves the wars!
[03:21:20.690 --> 03:21:21.671]  Oh, a war whore.
[03:21:21.691 --> 03:21:38.223]  Oh, and by the way, anybody that supports the wars, get in your military drag, go fight, send your wife, your kids, your money, yourself, or shut your mouths.
[03:21:38.383 --> 03:21:41.085]  Oh, and your transgenders, make sure you take them too.
[03:21:41.705 --> 03:21:43.367]  There's Van the Lion.
[03:21:44.507 --> 03:21:47.710]  The greatest threat is misinformation.
[03:21:49.875 --> 03:21:50.055]  Yep.
[03:21:53.456 --> 03:22:02.860]  And she goes on to say, very challenging times, but also ensuring its strong and influential voice in global affairs.
[03:22:03.360 --> 03:22:14.124]  Saying how great, great, great, the World Economic Forum, their strong and influential voice in global affairs.
[03:22:14.144 --> 03:22:15.645]  Yep.
[03:22:17.657 --> 03:22:23.979]  Your leadership is a beacon of inspiration, symbolizing unity, strength.
[03:22:23.999 --> 03:22:25.419]  Yep.
[03:22:27.560 --> 03:22:28.680]  Oh, this is the introduction.
[03:22:28.980 --> 03:22:29.840]  That was the introduction.
[03:22:30.320 --> 03:22:32.021]  President Ursula von Andrews.
[03:22:32.041 --> 03:22:32.441]  Yep.
[03:22:32.641 --> 03:22:33.141]  Excellency.
[03:22:33.461 --> 03:22:35.222]  She begins it by saying, you ready?
[03:22:35.662 --> 03:22:36.182]  Ready for this?
[03:22:37.162 --> 03:22:43.304]  Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, and dear Klaus Slob.
[03:22:45.545 --> 03:22:46.785]  Excellencies,
[03:22:47.714 --> 03:22:49.015]  Excellencies!
[03:22:49.575 --> 03:22:53.997]  Don't forget to bow down to the Excellencies!
[03:22:54.017 --> 03:22:56.097]  His Majesty!
[03:22:58.538 --> 03:22:59.439]  Excellencies!
[03:22:59.719 --> 03:23:01.700]  Who the hell are you talking to?
[03:23:02.960 --> 03:23:05.601]  Oh, Excellencies don't pee or poo.
[03:23:07.242 --> 03:23:09.142]  They're just a little giddy from the Bronx.
[03:23:11.683 --> 03:23:12.444]  Excellencies.
[03:23:14.004 --> 03:23:15.585]  That's how much better they are.
[03:23:16.283 --> 03:23:18.064]  And they own everything.
[03:23:18.565 --> 03:23:31.193]  So again, sobering reality, the risks are serious because they limit our ability to tackle the big global challenges we are facing.
[03:23:32.614 --> 03:23:41.520]  For the global business community, for the global business community, the global leaders own everything!
[03:23:42.267 --> 03:23:44.848]  You are not allowed to own anything!
[03:23:45.308 --> 03:23:48.009]  It is only the global community!
[03:23:48.889 --> 03:23:50.269]  I'm not lying!
[03:23:50.289 --> 03:24:01.393]  For the global business community, the top concern for the next two years is not conflict.
[03:24:01.713 --> 03:24:02.633]  Oh, no, not wars.
[03:24:02.753 --> 03:24:03.693]  Conflict.
[03:24:08.495 --> 03:24:09.135]  Or climate.
[03:24:09.887 --> 03:24:13.068]  It is disinformation and misinformation.
[03:24:14.668 --> 03:24:14.888]  Yep.
[03:24:15.988 --> 03:24:24.230]  In other words, you are only allowed to swallow the crap spruing out of our mouths?
[03:24:25.810 --> 03:24:26.451]  Who you talking?
[03:24:28.251 --> 03:24:28.851]  Oh, yeah.
[03:24:31.552 --> 03:24:32.672]  Put on that mask.
[03:24:33.392 --> 03:24:35.132]  Stand six feet apart.
[03:24:35.913 --> 03:24:36.913]  Oh, the jab?
[03:24:36.993 --> 03:24:37.693]  Sixty percent.
[03:24:38.783 --> 03:24:40.404]  96% efficacy rate.
[03:24:42.865 --> 03:24:46.327]  You have no idea the number of people I know that have COVID again.
[03:24:48.188 --> 03:24:49.189]  All jabbed up.
[03:24:49.389 --> 03:24:50.409]  Never got COVID.
[03:24:50.870 --> 03:24:51.650]  Haven't been sickened.
[03:24:53.431 --> 03:24:57.693]  Going on five years because I take vitamins and supplements every day.
[03:24:59.234 --> 03:25:00.234]  Try to stay in good health.
[03:25:01.895 --> 03:25:03.296]  But this is the crap going on.
[03:25:04.147 --> 03:25:05.848]  And again, that's why you go to InfoWars.
[03:25:05.888 --> 03:25:06.928]  They wrote this article.
[03:25:07.568 --> 03:25:08.129]  I looked it up.
[03:25:08.609 --> 03:25:12.430]  And when you read her whole thing, it is just so disgusting.
[03:25:12.470 --> 03:25:15.192]  They make it very clear of who's in charge.
[03:25:16.032 --> 03:25:30.438]  And the facts are also there as to who's in charge because you have the 1%, according to Oxfam, 1%
[03:25:34.361 --> 03:25:39.782]  Owns 43% of the global financial assets.
[03:25:41.142 --> 03:25:41.763]  That's right.
[03:25:43.263 --> 03:25:48.064]  We're nothing more than plantation workers on Slavelandia.
[03:25:49.344 --> 03:25:53.705]  And Davos, they're the plantation leaders, man.
[03:25:53.725 --> 03:25:53.785]  Yep.
[03:25:54.805 --> 03:25:55.005]  Yep.
[03:26:01.397 --> 03:26:05.178]  She makes it very, very, very clear.
[03:26:09.660 --> 03:26:12.461]  For the global business community!
[03:26:12.541 --> 03:26:16.942]  Hey, how about nationalization, huh?
[03:26:18.723 --> 03:26:23.184]  The only way America is going to come back is to become a self-sufficient economy.
[03:26:24.645 --> 03:26:30.627]  We have all the human and natural resources we can use, with the exception of very few.
[03:26:31.658 --> 03:26:32.899]  To be self-sustaining.
[03:26:34.840 --> 03:26:39.643]  We don't have to import products from other slave labor countries.
[03:26:40.343 --> 03:26:42.525]  And they did this so they wouldn't have to pay people.
[03:26:43.025 --> 03:26:55.113]  And by the way, when I was on with Alex Jones talking about the migration issue, I said what no one's talking about is the refugee issue.
[03:26:55.173 --> 03:27:00.576]  People are escaping lack of basic living standards, crime, government corruption, violence.
[03:27:01.738 --> 03:27:11.083]  I said, what no one's talking about is they're bringing in cheap labor and that's what the global community needs!
[03:27:11.984 --> 03:27:17.747]  Just go to Marshalls or CVS or any store and see.
[03:27:18.747 --> 03:27:19.428]  We need help.
[03:27:20.068 --> 03:27:21.189]  We need cheap labor.
[03:27:21.749 --> 03:27:23.570]  That's why they're letting them come in, I said.
[03:27:24.491 --> 03:27:28.853]  Now remember, that was back in
[03:27:33.427 --> 03:27:37.211]  Now, Financial Times, January 20th.
[03:27:38.872 --> 03:27:46.800]  German eases citizenship law to fill skills gap.
[03:27:49.623 --> 03:27:58.131]  German parliament passed a law that will make it easier for foreigners to acquire citizenship as Berlin looks to immigration programs
[03:27:58.672 --> 03:28:04.937]  To solve a dire shortage of skilled workers.
[03:28:05.378 --> 03:28:06.579]  Oh, yeah.
[03:28:06.779 --> 03:28:07.720]  You dumb people.
[03:28:07.780 --> 03:28:08.861]  What are you, the Germans?
[03:28:10.262 --> 03:28:18.068]  The Germans are one of the most advanced societies scientifically, culturally, philosophically in the world.
[03:28:19.109 --> 03:28:20.851]  You got to bring in slave labor?
[03:28:22.412 --> 03:28:24.574]  That's all they're doing it for.
[03:28:26.596 --> 03:28:26.956]  Got it?
[03:28:28.208 --> 03:28:33.169]  And again, that woman that called up talked about Congress.
[03:28:33.990 --> 03:28:39.191]  C-O-N-G-R-A-S-S.
[03:28:43.952 --> 03:28:46.373]  Dumb little clowns telling us what to do.
[03:28:47.433 --> 03:28:48.153]  So we're going to come back.
[03:28:48.173 --> 03:28:51.174]  We're going to talk about the economy, what's next, where it's going.
[03:28:52.094 --> 03:28:53.715]  And remember, support InfoWars.
[03:28:53.835 --> 03:28:54.535]  They're supporting you.
[03:28:56.749 --> 03:28:58.450]  Real death is shutting off the economy.
[03:28:58.650 --> 03:29:00.971]  The bureaucrats and the corporations control the economy.
[03:29:01.291 --> 03:29:04.773]  As they vertically integrate the economy and consolidate power, they murder people en masse.
[03:29:05.413 --> 03:29:12.617]  And Elon Musk has warned them that if you destroy civilization, you won't be able to have certain redoubts of it and certain city-states that still have it.
[03:29:12.657 --> 03:29:15.038]  The Hunger Games model, it will destroy the elite as well.
[03:29:15.298 --> 03:29:18.060]  And anybody that studies history and has common sense knows that.
[03:29:18.760 --> 03:29:23.721]  The wars that are going to come out of the starvation and the inflation are being blamed on global warming.
[03:29:23.941 --> 03:29:26.662]  The viruses that come out of the labs are being blamed on global warming.
[03:29:26.882 --> 03:29:30.323]  The third world hordes being organized by the UN to invade are being blamed on global warming.
[03:29:31.163 --> 03:29:32.864]  The mass starvation is blamed on the virus.
[03:29:34.304 --> 03:29:36.525]  And everywhere we're told it's going to get worse.
[03:29:36.625 --> 03:29:37.585]  Billions are coming.
[03:29:37.745 --> 03:29:40.066]  Al Gore and Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton.
[03:29:40.990 --> 03:29:48.141]  And the Rothschilds and the Davos Group and Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and Evaldo Harari say billions are coming to Europe.
[03:29:48.361 --> 03:29:49.823]  A billion are coming to the U.S.
[03:29:50.304 --> 03:29:51.586]  because of climate change.
[03:29:52.107 --> 03:29:56.493]  No, because you cut their economy off because the IMF or World Bank controls the loans and ordered lockdowns.
[03:30:21.044 --> 03:30:21.865]  We're good to go.
[03:30:40.162 --> 03:30:44.785]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will be down and out.
[03:30:57.884 --> 03:31:01.005]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:31:01.025 --> 03:31:02.545]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:31:03.325 --> 03:31:06.366]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:31:07.246 --> 03:31:15.349]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:31:16.189 --> 03:31:23.971]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:31:25.009 --> 03:31:27.871]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:31:27.891 --> 03:31:33.633]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:31:34.434 --> 03:31:35.334]  I know you spread the word.
[03:31:35.374 --> 03:31:36.855]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[03:31:36.895 --> 03:31:37.415]  Keep doing it.
[03:31:37.455 --> 03:31:45.740]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[03:31:46.380 --> 03:31:49.982]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:31:50.702 --> 03:31:55.308]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Enforcement.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:31:55.648 --> 03:31:56.489]  Please take action now.
[03:31:56.869 --> 03:32:05.019]  Cellular damage from a type of free radical known as reactive oxygen species can cause decreased cellular function.
[03:32:05.639 --> 03:32:12.266]  DNA Force Plus contains what are believed to be the most beneficial ingredients to remedy this.

[03:32:25.857 --> 03:32:31.120]  Low levels of pregnenolone are associated with fatigue and low brain function.
[03:32:31.200 --> 03:32:39.184]  The real Red Pill Plus is also full of essential trace minerals to synergistically support optimal cognitive function.

[03:32:58.174 --> 03:33:04.077]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:16.906 --> 03:33:21.008]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:21.328 --> 03:33:30.433]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Salente.
[03:33:31.493 --> 03:33:36.156]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:36.816 --> 03:33:39.338]  And again, what you're getting from info was...
[03:33:40.419 --> 03:33:48.863]  If you're not getting anywhere else, again, we put out a magazine, the Trends Journal, and of course we have great information in there that's going to help you in a very different way.
[03:33:50.283 --> 03:33:53.244]  There's no magazine like it.
[03:33:53.645 --> 03:33:56.066]  You look at our top trends that we called last year.
[03:33:56.126 --> 03:33:56.906]  They're right here.
[03:33:56.966 --> 03:33:58.727]  One of the top ones was Middle East Meltdown.
[03:33:59.447 --> 03:34:02.508]  And again, do what you can to support InfoWars.
[03:34:02.528 --> 03:34:09.271]  They have these great sales going on, and you can help supercharge your body, and you really need it now.
[03:34:10.237 --> 03:34:13.598]  And there's no better time to do it.
[03:34:13.958 --> 03:34:16.259]  Because we're going through really, really tough times.
[03:34:16.319 --> 03:34:24.001]  As I said, I haven't been sick now going on five years because I get all the essential vitamins, minerals, and nutrients that I need.
[03:34:24.441 --> 03:34:26.882]  And you get a lot of them from InfoWars.
[03:34:27.982 --> 03:34:29.743]  And again, it's crucial.
[03:34:29.823 --> 03:34:30.503]  It's your life.
[03:34:31.539 --> 03:34:33.240]  You know, you got to get in the best shape you can.
[03:34:33.260 --> 03:34:35.281]  And this really helps you do it.

[03:34:55.471 --> 03:34:58.393]  And... Great, great things.
[03:34:58.473 --> 03:35:00.154]  And they're selling out fast.
[03:35:00.294 --> 03:35:00.474]  So...
[03:35:01.351 --> 03:35:03.472]  So get what you can before they're gone.
[03:35:03.532 --> 03:35:05.773]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:35:05.833 --> 03:35:08.154]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:35:08.254 --> 03:35:09.434]  Save up to 50%.
[03:35:10.455 --> 03:35:12.575]  And again, you really need to supercharge your body.
[03:35:14.856 --> 03:35:16.397]  And again, these are 360 wins.
[03:35:17.357 --> 03:35:20.859]  You support InfoWars, and you're supporting yourself.
[03:35:21.299 --> 03:35:24.740]  You know, people don't like my language.
[03:35:24.760 --> 03:35:25.820]  They don't like my language.
[03:35:25.840 --> 03:35:27.201]  You know, if somebody...
[03:35:27.987 --> 03:35:29.628]  Somebody's trying to take you down, man.
[03:35:29.648 --> 03:35:30.909]  You'll say, please don't hit me.
[03:35:30.969 --> 03:35:32.090]  I'll be a good little boy.
[03:35:32.110 --> 03:35:33.471]  I'll be nice.
[03:35:34.552 --> 03:35:35.533]  It came out in this article.
[03:35:37.634 --> 03:35:39.856]  Swearing has become more acceptable.
[03:35:40.296 --> 03:35:40.736]  Expert.
[03:35:41.777 --> 03:35:47.802]  The use of swear words has become more widely acceptable in modern British society in recent years.
[03:35:49.143 --> 03:35:54.967]  Due to people finding alternative definitions for language previously considered distasteful.
[03:35:56.135 --> 03:35:59.357]  A linguistic expert says, linguistic expert.
[03:35:59.857 --> 03:36:01.178]  Hey, got some.
[03:36:01.839 --> 03:36:04.160]  The people are angry, you got it?
[03:36:04.860 --> 03:36:08.603]  It's appropriate language in an appropriate situation.
[03:36:09.103 --> 03:36:12.725]  Oh, hey, linguistic expert, maybe you forgot.
[03:36:13.346 --> 03:36:23.052]  Maybe you forgot the little clown boy that one of the finest cartoonists in the world couldn't open a freakier little figure than Boris Johnson.
[03:36:23.552 --> 03:36:25.193]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:36:25.902 --> 03:36:32.083]  Yeah, Boar, again, B-O-R space A-S-S.
[03:36:32.684 --> 03:36:34.264]  Boar S. Johnson.
[03:36:34.844 --> 03:36:35.024]  Yeah.
[03:36:35.864 --> 03:36:46.947]  The guy that gave you the COVID war, that destroyed your economy, as he's partying, and the cat don't know how to party, man, all day, you know what I mean?
[03:36:47.935 --> 03:36:50.816]  Again, I'm so sad when I look at the world.
[03:36:51.436 --> 03:36:53.796]  Not a drop of boogie, not an ounce of jive.
[03:36:53.816 --> 03:36:55.677]  So that cat, he wasn't partying.
[03:36:55.737 --> 03:36:57.537]  Oh, just like that other arrogant little boy.
[03:36:57.557 --> 03:37:01.038]  My daddy was the top lawyer for the Giddy Gang.
[03:37:01.478 --> 03:37:02.518]  Oh, yeah, Gavin Newsom.
[03:37:03.238 --> 03:37:08.079]  Closing down everything while he's partying at the French laundry at about $400 a plate.
[03:37:09.020 --> 03:37:15.521]  So going back to what's going on and why they're using this kind of language in the U.K.,
[03:37:17.037 --> 03:37:19.939]  Because I said you've got to put an F and a C in there in the UK.
[03:37:19.959 --> 03:37:23.062]  Because that's what they did to the people.
[03:37:24.082 --> 03:37:25.083]  And the people are angry.
[03:37:26.184 --> 03:37:27.725]  And it goes back to the callers.
[03:37:28.926 --> 03:37:29.847]  The people are fed up.
[03:37:31.968 --> 03:37:33.690]  Again, they don't want Trump or Biden.
[03:37:36.192 --> 03:37:38.073]  You get your Trends Journal, you've got more information.
[03:37:38.113 --> 03:37:40.495]  Again, go to Jones Trends, you get a good deal.
[03:37:41.676 --> 03:37:43.277]  Again, I supported Trump.
[03:37:43.777 --> 03:37:45.519]  And I don't support him anymore.
[03:37:46.710 --> 03:37:52.812]  And by the way, I also believe 100% that he won the election in 2020.
[03:37:54.732 --> 03:38:02.894]  I was doing the whole election broadcast with Greg Hunter on Watchdog USA.
[03:38:04.895 --> 03:38:06.655]  And I'm looking at the numbers are coming in.
[03:38:06.695 --> 03:38:07.676]  He had all the data.
[03:38:07.696 --> 03:38:08.836]  He had all these screens up.
[03:38:08.876 --> 03:38:10.036]  It was really top, top.
[03:38:10.076 --> 03:38:10.396]  He did.
[03:38:11.337 --> 03:38:13.717]  And it's Trump and Biden under him.
[03:38:13.737 --> 03:38:15.978]  It's going like this all over, all over.
[03:38:17.329 --> 03:38:25.836]  All of a sudden, like 120,000 mail-in ballots came in.
[03:38:25.916 --> 03:38:29.538]  And Biden got all of them, like from Wisconsin or Michigan or someplace.
[03:38:29.918 --> 03:38:31.360]  It happened like in a couple of states.
[03:38:32.280 --> 03:38:32.901]  Are you kidding me?
[03:38:32.921 --> 03:38:35.723]  When I'm six years old, you mean I'm 120 and you get one?
[03:38:37.324 --> 03:38:40.146]  Oh, and it was Trump that made up the mail-in ballot thing to happen.
[03:38:41.387 --> 03:38:45.690]  Who also gave us Operation Warp Speed Vax and
[03:38:46.946 --> 03:39:06.290]  And on March 13th, Black Friday, March 2020, he launched a state of emergency, declared a state of emergency to fight the COVID war.
[03:39:06.310 --> 03:39:08.751]  So anyway, I got a lot of reasons I don't think they can.
[03:39:09.631 --> 03:39:14.052]  Going back, the people, when you look at the polls, they want to change.
[03:39:15.902 --> 03:39:17.423]  We need a new third party.
[03:39:19.745 --> 03:39:22.567]  We need a Ron Paul type.
[03:39:23.428 --> 03:39:25.089]  Not Rand Paul, but Ron the Father.
[03:39:28.252 --> 03:39:29.373]  So the time is right.
[03:39:29.413 --> 03:39:32.055]  The people are fed up and that's why they're changing their language.
[03:39:33.336 --> 03:39:35.297]  It's situational language.
[03:39:35.718 --> 03:39:37.119]  It's the proper language.
[03:39:37.639 --> 03:39:38.760]  It's not swearing.
[03:39:38.780 --> 03:39:40.021]  What are you, kindergarten?
[03:39:41.482 --> 03:39:42.883]  That's a swear word.
[03:39:42.903 --> 03:39:45.145]  How do you know it's a swear word?
[03:39:45.984 --> 03:39:48.545]  Well, it's in Chapter 3, Section 8.
[03:39:48.625 --> 03:39:49.525]  It's a good book.
[03:39:53.366 --> 03:39:54.607]  They're not swear words.
[03:39:54.647 --> 03:39:55.887]  They're proper words.
[03:39:57.448 --> 03:39:58.948]  But you can't say them.
[03:39:58.968 --> 03:40:11.653]  So... Ron Paul has an article they have up on InfoWars that has to do with the economy.
[03:40:12.353 --> 03:40:14.354]  Going back to the economy, the markets are up...
[03:40:18.524 --> 03:40:27.286]  Gold's down, hanging around the four, down about seven bucks, 220 range, 2020.
[03:40:28.506 --> 03:40:30.246]  And Bitcoin's hanging in the 40,000 range.
[03:40:30.266 --> 03:40:34.847]  I would have thought it would have gone up after they had that ETF thing, but it hasn't.
[03:40:35.367 --> 03:40:36.548]  But I'm still bullish on it.
[03:40:37.508 --> 03:40:44.489]  I don't, you know, if it could go down another $10,000, it's still way up from where it began, starting at zero about 12 years ago.
[03:40:46.130 --> 03:40:47.770]  And I'm very bullish on gold.
[03:40:48.550 --> 03:40:50.151]  And again, we don't give financial advice.
[03:40:50.171 --> 03:40:56.093]  I'm just telling you what we see as trend forecasters, because they're going to be lowering interest rates in March.
[03:40:56.953 --> 03:40:58.853]  They'll run up to the presidential reality show.
[03:40:58.893 --> 03:41:08.397]  They're going to do everything they can to keep the power in power in power, because you've got Janet Yellen, who's our Treasury Secretary, the former head of the Federal Reserve.
[03:41:08.417 --> 03:41:09.877]  So you've got the gang.
[03:41:09.897 --> 03:41:10.697]  They want to keep the gang.
[03:41:10.858 --> 03:41:14.879]  Can you imagine the Federal Reserve head is running...
[03:41:19.727 --> 03:41:20.487]  Our Treasury Department.
[03:41:21.607 --> 03:41:24.428]  How stupid can you be not to see who's running the gang in charge?
[03:41:24.948 --> 03:41:29.729]  So going back to Ron Paul's article, he says, don't tax the rich and the Fed.
[03:41:30.969 --> 03:41:39.870]  Select politician, he goes on, they say raise the things, but he said the Federal Reserve is causing, is the cause of the inequality.
[03:41:40.831 --> 03:41:48.492]  First of all, I think, you know, if they're going to have taxes, go back to the Eisenhower days where these cats would be paying 90% and most of them paid nothing.
[03:41:49.904 --> 03:41:51.505]  And by the way, that's the other thing that Trump did.
[03:41:51.525 --> 03:41:52.845]  He lowered the taxes for these.
[03:41:53.325 --> 03:42:00.428]  And after he lowered the taxes for the corporations back in 2017, they had the biggest year of stock buybacks.
[03:42:01.169 --> 03:42:04.110]  Because he said, oh, they couldn't build capital improvements.
[03:42:04.650 --> 03:42:05.991]  Nothing for capital improvements.
[03:42:06.011 --> 03:42:07.571]  It all went to stock buybacks.
[03:42:07.871 --> 03:42:09.052]  Had a record year of stock buybacks.
[03:42:10.072 --> 03:42:18.836]  So going back to the Fed, the guy that gave us the Federal Reserve, may he rot in hell, is Woodrow Wilson.
[03:42:21.112 --> 03:42:24.614]  He created the Federal Reserve, then he gave us federal income taxes.
[03:42:26.735 --> 03:42:31.158]  He also gave us World War I. He's going to spread democracy across the globe.
[03:42:31.738 --> 03:42:33.679]  And they still repeat that crap.
[03:42:33.800 --> 03:42:35.120]  I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy.
[03:42:35.160 --> 03:42:36.681]  I'm going to go die for something.
[03:42:37.582 --> 03:42:41.084]  He assassinated Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo.
[03:42:41.124 --> 03:42:41.884]  Let's go fight!
[03:42:43.305 --> 03:42:48.528]  Oh, that clown lady about the War Crap Journal?
[03:42:48.748 --> 03:42:49.729]  I can't say the S-word?
[03:42:50.626 --> 03:42:53.188]  We said that we're the gatekeepers?
[03:42:53.528 --> 03:42:55.009]  Oh yeah, you sold us those wars too.
[03:42:55.029 --> 03:42:57.291]  It was a Hearst Corporation.
[03:42:57.331 --> 03:42:57.852]  I forgot.
[03:42:59.973 --> 03:43:01.334]  So going back to the taxes.
[03:43:05.217 --> 03:43:14.384]  Paul Craig Roberts you go to paulcraigroberts.org has an article about this.
[03:43:15.445 --> 03:43:18.828]  Americans enslave themselves to the state
[03:43:19.662 --> 03:43:21.843]  When they accepted the income tax.
[03:43:24.525 --> 03:43:34.892]  It was not until 1913, 137 years after the Declaration of Independence established a free people who are no longer free, that there was an income tax.
[03:43:38.454 --> 03:43:38.674]  Yep.
[03:43:42.697 --> 03:43:45.679]  The income tax required a constitutional amendment.
[03:43:46.119 --> 03:43:47.360]  I remember some of the story.
[03:43:47.380 --> 03:43:48.761]  What I remember is this.
[03:43:49.778 --> 03:43:55.222]  The threshold for being subjected to income tax was high and the first rate was 1%.
[03:43:55.262 --> 03:43:58.664]  So in other words, you really had to be rich.
[03:43:59.765 --> 03:44:11.133]  The Georgia legislative voted to ratify the amendment because as one legislative leader declared, quote, there's no one in Georgia with an income high enough to be subject to the tax.
[03:44:12.094 --> 03:44:13.996]  Let the Yankees tax themselves.
[03:44:14.056 --> 03:44:14.836]  Why should we object?
[03:44:16.037 --> 03:44:17.278]  There's no vision of the future.
[03:44:19.520 --> 03:44:32.085]  1913 was also the year that the Federal Reserve with its policy of depression, inflation, recession, and inflation was established and unleashed on America.
[03:44:35.267 --> 03:44:45.692]  And that was also the year World War I and its inflation was about to be launched by the French, Russians, and British governments.
[03:44:46.821 --> 03:44:54.046]  War on inflation quickly brought the income tax to Americans who thought they were exempt.
[03:45:01.191 --> 03:45:03.512]  Ron Paul is 100% correct.
[03:45:05.574 --> 03:45:07.035]  Do away with the federal income tax.
[03:45:09.196 --> 03:45:12.038]  We've got a bunch of clowns that have all these bureaucratic jobs.
[03:45:12.318 --> 03:45:13.800]  Actually, they spell that wrong.
[03:45:14.080 --> 03:45:15.721]  They're bureaucraps.
[03:45:16.821 --> 03:45:25.309]  Little boys and girls who can't get a job in the real world that suck into the political system bow down so they can get their way up to the top.
[03:45:25.709 --> 03:45:28.372]  And they become the most arrogant.
[03:45:28.872 --> 03:45:30.193]  The most arrogant.
[03:45:31.815 --> 03:45:33.997]  We don't need the federal government to tell us what to do.
[03:45:35.138 --> 03:45:36.479]  I believe in states' rights.
[03:45:38.361 --> 03:45:43.165]  Pro-abortion, anti-abortion, choose your state.
[03:45:47.042 --> 03:45:47.722]  Gun laws?
[03:45:49.624 --> 03:45:50.364]  No gun laws?
[03:45:52.466 --> 03:45:52.506]  No.
[03:45:52.526 --> 03:45:54.507]  You can't choose your state on that one.
[03:45:55.067 --> 03:45:56.268]  Because that's the Second Amendment.
[03:45:59.030 --> 03:46:00.991]  So you pick and choose where you want to go.
[03:46:03.553 --> 03:46:04.694]  I believe in states' rights.
[03:46:06.655 --> 03:46:13.599]  Before the war criminal, I did a podcast with Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[03:46:13.659 --> 03:46:14.760]  I do one every Wednesday.
[03:46:14.780 --> 03:46:15.861]  You go to Gerald Salenti.com.
[03:46:16.761 --> 03:46:23.186]  And he was talking about when Nikki Haley came out and said that it was not only slavery about Lincoln and they attacked her.
[03:46:23.986 --> 03:46:31.712]  And he said, of course, he's no supporter of Nikki Haley, who's nothing more than Lindsey Graham in high heels, using his term.
[03:46:32.832 --> 03:46:36.355]  But the Civil War wasn't about slavery.
[03:46:37.576 --> 03:46:40.698]  It was about more government control, unionization.
[03:46:40.758 --> 03:46:44.821]  And he went on to say that the Emancipation Proclamation did not free the slaves.
[03:46:46.142 --> 03:46:46.282]  That
[03:46:46.943 --> 03:46:53.708]  Freedom of slavery wasn't enacted in law until eight months after Lincoln died.
[03:46:56.249 --> 03:47:00.132]  So this whole tax thing is just to build a federal government.
[03:47:01.253 --> 03:47:02.934]  And we don't need the feds in charge.
[03:47:03.935 --> 03:47:05.116]  We the people are in charge.
[03:47:06.457 --> 03:47:07.818]  We have to unite to do that.
[03:47:07.998 --> 03:47:12.741]  Right now there's no politician that I support that's speaking about that.
[03:47:14.181 --> 03:47:15.902]  But there's no need for this federal income.
[03:47:16.202 --> 03:47:18.383]  I don't want to tell you how much federal income tax I pay.
[03:47:18.703 --> 03:47:20.603]  Oh, then I pay taxes.
[03:47:20.683 --> 03:47:21.544]  I never had any kids.
[03:47:23.865 --> 03:47:25.185]  My mother made she rest in peace.
[03:47:25.245 --> 03:47:26.426]  I was the youngest of five.
[03:47:26.606 --> 03:47:27.626]  Again, born in 1946.
[03:47:28.767 --> 03:47:28.987]  Phew!
[03:47:29.887 --> 03:47:30.727]  Three years could be.
[03:47:31.388 --> 03:47:35.169]  One time she was chasing me around the house and she finally caught me.
[03:47:35.229 --> 03:47:36.590]  Italian women never hit their kids.
[03:47:36.990 --> 03:47:37.730]  Used to bite their hand.
[03:47:39.935 --> 03:47:43.956]  In Italian, she said to me, I can't repeat what that means.
[03:47:44.456 --> 03:47:45.397]  You're better off dead.
[03:47:45.697 --> 03:47:47.137]  You should have three worse than you.
[03:47:47.157 --> 03:47:48.938]  I couldn't imagine one like me.
[03:47:49.298 --> 03:47:53.779]  I ran away from kindergarten at four and a half years old and crossed the Boston Post road in the Bronx.
[03:47:53.799 --> 03:47:58.500]  She used to tell me they used to tie me into a crib with nylon stockings because I'm out the window.
[03:47:59.941 --> 03:48:02.782]  Again, now they have them arrested for tying me into the crib.
[03:48:03.542 --> 03:48:04.782]  I'm off dead.
[03:48:04.802 --> 03:48:06.683]  Let them climb out the window.
[03:48:07.583 --> 03:48:08.003]  So anyway,
[03:48:09.602 --> 03:48:18.466]  We're talking about federal income tax, talking about freedom and... What the hell was I talking about?
[03:48:18.486 --> 03:48:20.867]  Talking about federal income tax.
[03:48:21.348 --> 03:48:23.589]  Anyway, forgot.
[03:48:28.191 --> 03:48:28.931]  Lost our freedom.
[03:48:29.832 --> 03:48:30.252]  It's gone.
[03:48:31.132 --> 03:48:34.254]  And as I said, I'm a lucky guy because where I was born and when I was born.
[03:48:35.094 --> 03:48:38.876]  But going back to the rich getting richer...
[03:48:39.787 --> 03:48:45.070]  From the time I grew up, there were drug stores, stationery stores, hardware stores.
[03:48:46.611 --> 03:48:48.613]  Now, the bigs own everything.
[03:48:49.553 --> 03:48:51.975]  So, no federal taxes.
[03:48:55.177 --> 03:48:55.897]  States' rights.
[03:48:58.459 --> 03:49:00.800]  And going back to the economy, where is it going to go?
[03:49:00.820 --> 03:49:03.662]  They're going to lower interest rates, as I said.
[03:49:03.682 --> 03:49:06.324]  When interest rates go down, the dollar goes down.
[03:49:07.481 --> 03:49:09.883]  And, again, that's the cover of your magazine this week.
[03:49:10.543 --> 03:49:11.384]  Dollar sinking.
[03:49:13.665 --> 03:49:14.966]  No, dollar diving.
[03:49:15.466 --> 03:49:16.247]  America sinking.
[03:49:18.108 --> 03:49:19.789]  This is the beginning of the death of the dollar.
[03:49:20.790 --> 03:49:23.331]  The world has had enough of the United States and Germany.
[03:49:24.792 --> 03:49:26.493]  Geopolitically and economically.
[03:49:26.513 --> 03:49:28.695]  I want to go on to some other articles.
[03:49:30.656 --> 03:49:33.558]  Yeah, anyway, go to drpaulcraigroberts.com.
[03:49:34.218 --> 03:49:36.019]  Ron Paul swears.
[03:49:36.140 --> 03:49:36.680]  Oh, here we go.
[03:49:38.988 --> 03:49:44.390]  Cargo theft spiked 57% in 2003 versus 2002, new data shows.
[03:49:44.830 --> 03:49:48.331]  This is according to CargoNet.
[03:49:50.692 --> 03:49:54.073]  Look at all the stores that are closing up because of violence and crime.
[03:49:55.234 --> 03:49:57.114]  Look at how the theft rates are going up.
[03:49:57.835 --> 03:50:02.496]  This is all a result of the COVID war, and no one is talking about that.
[03:50:04.097 --> 03:50:04.337]  No one.
[03:50:06.986 --> 03:50:08.987]  Everything spiked since the COVID war.
[03:50:11.749 --> 03:50:12.590]  Mental illness.
[03:50:13.871 --> 03:50:15.312]  China going down the toilet.
[03:50:15.332 --> 03:50:18.894]  They've had three years of zero COVID policy bringing down the whole global economy.
[03:50:19.674 --> 03:50:22.256]  Artificially propped up with record low interest rates.
[03:50:23.617 --> 03:50:25.858]  And trillions of dollars pumped into the economy.
[03:50:27.780 --> 03:50:28.740]  Trump and Biden.
[03:50:29.261 --> 03:50:30.101]  Trillions pumped in.
[03:50:32.583 --> 03:50:34.004]  So, this is serious.
[03:50:35.145 --> 03:50:35.545]  And now...
[03:50:36.874 --> 03:50:41.835]  When you look at where the economy is going and you have to put all things connected.
[03:50:41.855 --> 03:50:46.056]  You ready?
[03:50:52.317 --> 03:50:58.158]  Ukraine just bombed a drone attack at a Russian terminal.
[03:51:00.018 --> 03:51:03.179]  That drove oil prices up 2%.
[03:51:05.382 --> 03:51:08.923]  We have warned from the very beginning Ukraine's going to lose the war.
[03:51:11.664 --> 03:51:13.424]  And everybody knows it now.
[03:51:14.404 --> 03:51:17.405]  Although everybody denied it in the mainstream media when we said it.
[03:51:17.565 --> 03:51:18.485]  And others said it too.
[03:51:18.845 --> 03:51:23.807]  Douglas McGregor, Scott Ritter, Phil Giraldi, one after another.
[03:51:24.167 --> 03:51:27.108]  We knew that no way they're going to win.
[03:51:27.168 --> 03:51:32.909]  We've warned they're going to do a false flag event or a major attack on a nuclear power plant or something.
[03:51:33.854 --> 03:51:40.219]  That's going to make the people hate Russia again and support Ukraine as their popularity keeps declining.
[03:51:40.239 --> 03:51:42.240]  You saw they were a bust at Davos.
[03:51:43.000 --> 03:51:44.762]  They're not getting the money and weapons they need.
[03:51:45.902 --> 03:51:47.824]  So now, oil prices are up 2%.
[03:51:48.684 --> 03:51:54.529]  Now let's go to what's going on in Israel with the Israel war.
[03:51:55.749 --> 03:52:03.515]  Over the weekend, Netanyahu said, by the way, Gaza death toll surpasses
[03:52:04.347 --> 03:52:14.209]  25,000.
[03:52:04.507 --> 03:52:14.209]  Over the weekend, Netanyahu said that, are we targeting Iran?
[03:52:14.469 --> 03:52:15.729]  Yes, we've been targeting them.
[03:52:16.429 --> 03:52:16.850]  Wait a minute.
[03:52:20.090 --> 03:52:21.170]  You've been targeting Iran.
[03:52:22.291 --> 03:52:22.431]  Hmm.
[03:52:24.511 --> 03:52:26.371]  What if Iran was targeting Israel?
[03:52:26.491 --> 03:52:26.692]  Why?
[03:52:26.732 --> 03:52:27.392]  How dare they?
[03:52:28.532 --> 03:52:31.973]  He goes on to say that we want to stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons.
[03:52:32.573 --> 03:52:33.993]  He's been only saying this for how long?
[03:52:36.155 --> 03:52:38.856]  We had a picture in the Trends Journal going back in 2012.
[03:52:38.896 --> 03:52:46.759]  The artist had a great picture of him at the United Nations with a ticking time bomb.
[03:52:49.400 --> 03:52:49.960]  Now wait a minute.
[03:52:51.181 --> 03:52:54.782]  How many nuclear warheads does Israel have?
[03:52:56.743 --> 03:52:57.923]  Numbers go up as high as 400.
[03:52:57.963 --> 03:53:04.606]  So it's okay for Israel to have nuclear weapons.
[03:53:05.475 --> 03:53:06.156]  But not Iran.
[03:53:06.276 --> 03:53:06.836]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:53:08.017 --> 03:53:08.637]  Oh, okay.
[03:53:10.299 --> 03:53:11.079]  I hear your BS.
[03:53:12.320 --> 03:53:14.122]  So he says he's targeting Iran.
[03:53:16.043 --> 03:53:18.365]  And Iran's now saying, we're not going to take this anymore.
[03:53:18.425 --> 03:53:25.671]  Just killed a couple of more Iranians, military people in Syria.
[03:53:27.752 --> 03:53:29.514]  And he admitted that they're targeting Iran.
[03:53:30.915 --> 03:53:33.777]  By the way, Netanyahu's popularity rating is in the toilet.
[03:53:36.263 --> 03:53:39.065]  Oh, by the way, his son is still hiding out in Miami.
[03:53:39.085 --> 03:53:40.066]  He's not fighting the war.
[03:53:41.107 --> 03:53:42.007]  He'll leave.
[03:53:48.372 --> 03:53:55.498]  If Iran and Israel ramp up military between the two of them, the United States get involved.
[03:53:57.279 --> 03:53:58.080]  Oil prices go up 2%.
[03:53:58.140 --> 03:54:00.522]  You're going to read up oil prices went up 80%.
[03:54:00.662 --> 03:54:00.822]  Yeah.
[03:54:05.370 --> 03:54:09.471]  And that's going to crash the global economy and the equity markets.
[03:54:10.991 --> 03:54:13.712]  And probably the end of the world.
[03:54:15.612 --> 03:54:18.513]  Because there's a thing you could look up called the Samson Option.
[03:54:22.894 --> 03:54:23.374]  From Israel.
[03:54:24.435 --> 03:54:25.595]  If they lose, they go nuke.
[03:54:29.036 --> 03:54:29.856]  So we need peace.
[03:54:31.405 --> 03:54:32.846]  And where are all the religions?
[03:54:32.906 --> 03:54:35.507]  How come they're not out there protesting for peace?
[03:54:36.868 --> 03:54:40.310]  Again, I launched Occupy Peace almost a decade ago.
[03:54:41.470 --> 03:54:40.310]  2014.
[03:54:41.651 --> 03:54:48.154]  So I'm doing everything I can.
[03:54:48.174 --> 03:54:50.035]  Because I see the future.
[03:54:50.075 --> 03:54:50.815]  That's my business.
[03:54:55.178 --> 03:54:56.218]  Friends, 2000.
[03:54:58.219 --> 03:54:59.280]  International bestseller.
[03:55:00.831 --> 03:55:03.892]  Trend Tracking, Father of the Megatrends, Time Magazine, Trends Journal.
[03:55:04.452 --> 03:55:08.313]  Again, you get it by going to jonestrends.com, jonestrends.com.
[03:55:08.633 --> 03:55:09.594]  I've been at this a lot of years.
[03:55:09.654 --> 03:55:10.354]  I see the future.
[03:55:11.434 --> 03:55:12.094]  It's hell on earth.
[03:55:14.655 --> 03:55:15.075]  Hell on earth.
[03:55:16.896 --> 03:55:19.277]  You got that little clown boy, Anthony Blinken.
[03:55:19.317 --> 03:55:21.497]  My daddy was ambassador to Hungary.
[03:55:21.557 --> 03:55:24.738]  My uncle was ambassador to Belgium or to Dalton, Holland.
[03:55:26.639 --> 03:55:29.880]  He's at Davos saying, oh, how heartbreaking it is to see the Palestinians
[03:55:30.370 --> 03:55:30.910]  Being killed.
[03:55:32.371 --> 03:55:40.717]  As he bypasses Congress to send a couple hundred million dollars of weapons to keep slaughtering the people.
[03:55:41.597 --> 03:55:43.038]  What a two-faced little clown.
[03:55:44.219 --> 03:55:45.340]  I'm totally opposed to this.
[03:55:45.780 --> 03:55:46.641]  Totally opposed to it.
[03:55:47.982 --> 03:55:50.503]  Totally, totally, totally opposed to the slaughter going on.
[03:55:51.924 --> 03:55:53.866]  And totally opposed to the thing called settlements.
[03:55:54.886 --> 03:55:55.747]  Stealing the land.
[03:55:56.367 --> 03:55:58.909]  Violation of the Geneva Convention and Article 242.
[03:56:03.522 --> 03:56:04.422]  The United Nations.
[03:56:04.862 --> 03:56:11.965]  And again, in your Trends Journal, when Netanyahu got in, the mainstream media called it extreme right-wing government.
[03:56:13.085 --> 03:56:25.889]  And week after week, we wrote about the atrocities that extreme right-wing government was causing against the Palestinians in the, quote, occupied West Bank.
[03:56:28.310 --> 03:56:31.031]  Blowing up... Oh, by the way, it was reported...
[03:56:32.597 --> 03:56:37.639]  Over a thousand mosques have been blown up in Gaza.
[03:56:38.939 --> 03:56:40.900]  What if a thousand synagogues were blown up?
[03:56:42.320 --> 03:56:42.480]  Oh!
[03:56:43.860 --> 03:56:45.761]  And again, don't call me anti-Jewish.
[03:56:46.141 --> 03:56:46.901]  I'm anti-war.
[03:56:47.201 --> 03:56:49.182]  I'm not anti-American because I hate America's wars.
[03:56:49.202 --> 03:56:50.122]  I don't even go into it.
[03:56:51.343 --> 03:56:52.343]  And so save your crap.
[03:56:56.024 --> 03:56:57.705]  This is disgusting what's going on.
[03:56:59.165 --> 03:56:59.945]  We need peace.
[03:57:00.785 --> 03:57:02.066]  Because if we don't have peace,
[03:57:03.001 --> 03:57:03.682]  Forget about it.
[03:57:04.182 --> 03:57:05.763]  You got maniacs in charge.
[03:57:06.884 --> 03:57:09.185]  Unless you could think Biden got a brain.
[03:57:14.529 --> 03:57:15.950]  It's the Wizard of Oz, man.
[03:57:17.071 --> 03:57:17.992]  I lost my brain.
[03:57:18.012 --> 03:57:19.733]  Oh, no, I got it.
[03:57:19.813 --> 03:57:20.593]  Mitch McConnell.
[03:57:21.014 --> 03:57:21.854]  Oh, yeah, he's great.
[03:57:22.115 --> 03:57:23.576]  Oh, how about that little clown boy?
[03:57:23.796 --> 03:57:24.076]  Oh, no.
[03:57:24.356 --> 03:57:27.218]  Oh, then Kamala Harris will be president if anything happens to Biden.
[03:57:27.438 --> 03:57:28.479]  Oh, that'd be terrific.
[03:57:28.559 --> 03:57:30.340]  Oh, right there, man.
[03:57:30.881 --> 03:57:32.502]  Oh, then you got little Mikey Johnson.
[03:57:33.652 --> 03:57:34.232]  Number three.
[03:57:34.252 --> 03:57:42.037]  So listen, do everything you can to support InfoWars because InfoWars is doing everything they can to support you.
[03:57:42.537 --> 03:57:43.277]  Love being on.

[03:57:51.142 --> 03:57:51.802]  Winter is coming.
[03:57:54.341 --> 03:57:55.842]  Winter is coming.
[03:57:56.143 --> 03:57:57.524]  Winter isn't coming.
[03:57:58.124 --> 03:57:59.405]  Winter is here.
