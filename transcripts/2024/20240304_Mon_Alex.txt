[00:00:08.314 --> 00:00:13.796]  It's Monday, March 4th, 2024, and the Supreme Court ruled unanimously for Trump.
[00:00:14.916 --> 00:00:17.037]  Oh yeah, of course.
[00:00:17.377 --> 00:00:19.017]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:19.037 --> 00:00:36.583]  245 days, 12 hours, 59 minutes, 44 seconds until the most important election in world history that's unanimously agreed on by people who love freedom and those that serve tyranny and those that love oppression.
[00:00:38.342 --> 00:01:07.567]  Well, the Supreme Court has been under massive attack, but the Soros Democrat Party-funded lawfare was so outrageous, taking Trump off the ballot in Colorado and other states, that they ruled unanimously because a five-year-old could read the Constitution and see that Trump was never convicted, federally or at the state level or locally, of any of that crap, and no one else was, of the imaginary insurrection
[00:01:08.703 --> 00:01:14.767]  And then a court found, and other courts have found, that Trump is guilty and cannot be on the ballot.
[00:01:14.847 --> 00:01:17.549]  The essence of election meddling, the essence of stealing.
[00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:23.814]  An election, it doesn't indict Trump, it indicts them, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:24.614 --> 00:01:37.604]  As I came in this morning, I was in the middle of getting ready, they walked in and said, the ruling just came down, they handed me the ruling, and I scanned over it, it's a lengthy ruling, but I knew what I'd read in the first few pages, and sure as hell, it was all there.
[00:01:38.717 --> 00:01:42.460]  They said, we don't even need to state this, but we will for the lower courts.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.825]  He was never convicted of Jack Diddley Squat, and that if he was, it would be by the Congress.
[00:01:50.325 --> 00:01:54.688]  That's in the Constitution, bigger than Dallas.
[00:01:56.769 --> 00:01:57.930]  So then, how do they do it?
[00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.693]  Well, it's in the Constitution that you get a jury trial, if you want one.
[00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:04.852]  I didn't get a jury trial in my show trials.
[00:02:04.972 --> 00:02:07.632]  Oh, I was found guilty that they had a show trial.
[00:02:08.132 --> 00:02:08.692]  Even worse.
[00:02:09.553 --> 00:02:13.593]  But with Trump, they're dispensing with juries all together and going, well, it's a bench trial.
[00:02:14.774 --> 00:02:17.954]  You can choose to waive a jury and have a bench trial.
[00:02:19.415 --> 00:02:28.337]  Trump wanted a jury trial and was not given a jury trial in the New York kangaroo court operation that we saw.
[00:02:30.492 --> 00:02:35.674]  This is a good sign that the blackmail and the intimidation of the Supreme Court has not been successful.
[00:02:36.554 --> 00:02:43.837]  And that the court realizes that if they continue to bend to controlled media opposition, they'll all be completely demonized and attacked and destroyed.
[00:02:45.158 --> 00:02:46.618]  And they also see which way the wind's blowing.
[00:02:46.638 --> 00:02:47.859]  People are sick of all the tyranny.
[00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:56.182]  The court's been ruling that the federal agencies can't just make laws outside of Congress and get rid of cows or get rid of pipelines or shut down oil drilling permits.
[00:02:57.304 --> 00:02:58.444]  That's a lot of good news.
[00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:00.265]  This is amazing.
[00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:02.606]  In fact, I'm not a champagne guy.
[00:03:03.286 --> 00:03:04.107]  Gives me a headache.
[00:03:05.087 --> 00:03:09.549]  But, folks, go down to the liquor store at the corner.
[00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:15.611]  I'll give you guys a hundred bucks, because you've got to have a good glass of champagne for something like this.
[00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:21.133]  And get a really good bottle of Brut Champagne and some plastic glasses.
[00:03:21.273 --> 00:03:26.435]  And whoever wants to share a half glass with me is welcome to, coming up next hour.
[00:03:27.824 --> 00:03:29.226]  It's about a liquor store about a mile away.
[00:03:30.227 --> 00:03:32.050]  And we're gonna have a little champagne here on air.
[00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.536]  I haven't had champagne on air since Trump won in 2016.
[00:03:36.676 --> 00:03:40.061]  I mean, this is a really, really good sign.
[00:03:40.962 --> 00:03:44.086]  Everybody loves the famous meme of me drinking champagne with Roger Stonewell.
[00:03:44.957 --> 00:03:45.798]  I don't have any champagne.
[00:03:45.898 --> 00:03:49.020]  I think we bought some champagne glasses later in case we ever do it again.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.401]  I think they're actually in the break room.
[00:03:52.062 --> 00:03:57.245]  Point is, go get a bottle of that French Nouveau or whatever.
[00:03:57.265 --> 00:03:58.406]  It has one of the butterfly on it.
[00:03:58.426 --> 00:04:00.067]  I don't know if everybody likes that.
[00:04:00.488 --> 00:04:02.249]  I like it when I do drink champagne occasionally.
[00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:04.270]  Maybe once a year at a wedding or something.
[00:04:04.771 --> 00:04:10.695]  So get a bottle of that and we're going to drink that sucker on air here today.
[00:04:11.946 --> 00:04:15.608]  Because this is cause for celebration, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:22.873]  Yeah, I rarely have a glass of champagne on air, but when it's called for, it's called for, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:23.913 --> 00:04:26.415]  But it ties into a big article.
[00:04:29.502 --> 00:04:34.704]  Dealing with all of this, that the un-American persecution of Trump is very dangerous to everybody.
[00:04:35.164 --> 00:04:37.544]  Believe me, I know how dangerous it is.
[00:04:38.285 --> 00:04:45.407]  But all of these attacks are completely hollow with zero, zero legal standing.
[00:04:45.447 --> 00:04:49.928]  But they don't care because they've got, I'd say, 70% of the courts in this country.
[00:04:49.948 --> 00:04:54.390]  If you go by population, that's a conservative estimate.
[00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:55.710]  They've almost got our ass.
[00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.551]  But not yet, you pedophile bastards.

[00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.773]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:06:08.914 --> 00:06:16.880]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:20.844 --> 00:06:24.547]  This will be a day long remembered.
[00:06:24.607 --> 00:06:27.610]  Monday, March 4th, 2024.
[00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:32.194]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:06:36.471 --> 00:06:44.218]  Well, the Supreme Court did the right thing and what's really important about this is they had a unanimous ruling.
[00:06:55.367 --> 00:06:59.731]  The Supreme Court ruled unanimously today.
[00:07:01.055 --> 00:07:11.726]  March 4, 2024, that Soros, the Democrats, and the CIA have not yet completely conquered this country for their pedophile, satanic dreams.
[00:07:13.728 --> 00:07:16.070]  And they've not yet completely enslaved the nation.
[00:07:17.192 --> 00:07:21.156]  A unanimous vote, that means the Democrat Party cockroaches
[00:07:22.688 --> 00:07:41.756]  Put in there by Obama and Biden and others knew that they would be such laughingstocks in history and they could see the tide turning against them that they voted unanimously because there wasn't one one billionth of evidence that Trump attacked the Capitol on January 6 or directed it.
[00:07:42.756 --> 00:07:44.217]  No motive made us look terrible.
[00:07:44.537 --> 00:07:45.297]  They set us up.
[00:07:47.198 --> 00:07:48.859]  But on top of that, he was never convicted.
[00:07:50.836 --> 00:07:54.120]  And the only group that can convict the President is in impeachment.
[00:07:55.421 --> 00:08:04.490]  And that's in the Constitution, or every prosecutor in the country becomes co-equal to the President and can veto the votes of the American people.
[00:08:05.892 --> 00:08:09.996]  Rick Perry's far from perfect, but he's an angel compared to the Democratic Party here in Texas.
[00:08:11.178 --> 00:08:20.602]  And I remember 8, 9, 10 years ago now, time flies, the county attorney got pulled over and she blew, I forget the number, but she was so drunk it would kill a horse.
[00:08:21.243 --> 00:08:23.023]  It was like one of the highest ever recorded.
[00:08:23.784 --> 00:08:27.005]  And she was hissing and screaming and attacking the sheriff's deputies.
[00:08:27.705 --> 00:08:31.307]  She was biting them and clawing them and spitting on them.
[00:08:31.667 --> 00:08:37.590]  There was famous footage released of the Travis County District Attorney, that's the county where Austin City is located.
[00:08:38.848 --> 00:08:39.408]  We're good to go.
[00:09:03.775 --> 00:09:06.677]  Accountability Anti-Corruption Ethics Board.
[00:09:06.817 --> 00:09:08.659]  It was an ethics board, state ethics board.
[00:09:09.479 --> 00:09:11.921]  And it was based in Austin, Texas, Travis County.
[00:09:12.021 --> 00:09:15.764]  And the head of the board was the county attorney.
[00:09:17.485 --> 00:09:19.426]  This crazy woman, I forget her name, you can pull it up.
[00:09:20.267 --> 00:09:33.156]  And Rick Perry said, if you don't take her off the board, every two years we've just been authorizing and passing this bill in the budget to have this ethics board, I will veto the money for the ethics board.
[00:09:34.895 --> 00:09:43.919]  They indicted Rick Perry for vetoing a bill when it's law that the governor, obviously in any state, can veto a bill.
[00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.681]  So, and Rick Perry talked about it.
[00:09:47.701 --> 00:09:48.782]  He said, yeah, I beat it.
[00:09:48.842 --> 00:09:50.903]  It took two years and two and a half million dollars.
[00:09:51.583 --> 00:09:54.605]  Every dime I had, I had to mortgage my house.
[00:09:57.586 --> 00:09:58.466]  Two and a half million dollars.
[00:10:00.507 --> 00:10:01.908]  And then they didn't get in any trouble for it.
[00:10:02.889 --> 00:10:03.509]  So if you ask...
[00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:04.890]  Yes.
[00:10:07.052 --> 00:10:09.834]  Remember Tom DeLay, biggest Republican fundraiser.
[00:10:10.534 --> 00:10:11.615]  Absolutely badass.
[00:10:12.916 --> 00:10:14.757]  They indicted his ass over and over again.
[00:10:14.797 --> 00:10:16.338]  He got it all overturned later.
[00:10:16.618 --> 00:10:17.999]  Cost him $10 million.
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.222]  And knocked him out of politics.
[00:10:22.823 --> 00:10:30.048]  So, what they've done to Rick Perry and Tom DeLay, they've now done to Alex Jones, they're now trying to do to Trump.
[00:10:30.128 --> 00:10:31.189]  And if they get Trump,
[00:10:32.148 --> 00:10:33.649]  I'm gonna explain this very slowly.
[00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:41.633]  Whether you're a middle-class, blue-collar, ultra-rich, whoever you are, if you're not in the globalist club, and later even if you are in the globalist club, they're gonna come for you.
[00:10:42.094 --> 00:10:43.635]  They're going to take your assets.
[00:10:43.655 --> 00:10:45.135]  They're going to take your real estate.
[00:10:45.396 --> 00:10:46.736]  They're going to take your businesses.
[00:10:46.996 --> 00:10:48.097]  This is how it works.
[00:10:50.338 --> 00:10:55.982]  And notice, before I get back on the Supreme Court ruling that's got me really excited, and it should excite everybody.
[00:10:59.564 --> 00:11:00.004]  Notice,
[00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:22.374]  That Letitia James, within two weeks of the judge ruling that Trump's going to lose his empire, and they're going to take all his property, and all the rest of it, no jury, just a judge, that she's now saying, I'm going to take down the beef industry, and is going after the biggest meat packer in the country, for quote, climate change.
[00:11:23.374 --> 00:11:25.934]  No evidence of man-made climate change, no evidence of anything.
[00:11:26.434 --> 00:11:27.554]  She doesn't care.
[00:11:28.015 --> 00:11:30.315]  She's now been unleashed on them.
[00:11:32.671 --> 00:11:33.932]  With our globalist war.
[00:11:34.392 --> 00:11:38.535]  Because that's Soros' biggest beachhead is New York and California.
[00:11:40.136 --> 00:11:44.278]  Our beachhead is Florida, Texas, and a few other states.
[00:11:45.139 --> 00:11:46.640]  But we're at war.
[00:11:48.021 --> 00:11:50.762]  Total war with these people.
[00:11:50.903 --> 00:11:58.047]  So, just two weeks ago, Leticia James and Governor Hochul and all of them said, don't worry, don't leave New York.
[00:11:59.508 --> 00:12:00.749]  We're not going to come after you.
[00:12:01.837 --> 00:12:11.223]  Folks, it doesn't matter if you are an auto parts manufacturer, or a gun manufacturer, or the NRA, or a meat packing system, or a grocery store chain.
[00:12:13.144 --> 00:12:18.667]  They're coming after everything, because there's still a lot of wealth in this country that's owned by different groups and different people that aren't globalist.
[00:12:19.347 --> 00:12:20.428]  And they're at war with those people.
[00:12:21.048 --> 00:12:25.311]  So I don't care who you are, whether you make $50,000, $100,000, a million dollars, a million dollars a year.
[00:12:27.847 --> 00:12:34.435]  The New World Order, if you're not BlackRock and that small group of people, is coming after you.
[00:12:34.836 --> 00:12:36.678]  What are you going to do to resist it?
[00:12:36.718 --> 00:12:40.924]  So, I never do this, and I'm just going to do this right now, before I get into all this news.
[00:12:43.607 --> 00:12:45.489]  I have the New World Order coming after me.
[00:12:46.277 --> 00:12:47.318]  Because I represent you.
[00:12:47.978 --> 00:12:49.018]  Not because I'm a hero.
[00:12:49.158 --> 00:12:50.099]  I don't like injustice.
[00:12:50.199 --> 00:12:52.760]  I recognize if you're under attack, I'm under attack.
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.722]  And when our basic checks and balances get shredded, I mean, I get pissed, folks, because I'm territorial.
[00:12:57.742 --> 00:12:58.803]  I don't want to be a slave.
[00:12:59.503 --> 00:13:01.364]  I'm not perfect, but I never back down from a fight.
[00:13:01.764 --> 00:13:02.325]  I can't help it.
[00:13:04.125 --> 00:13:07.587]  And because I realize it's a lot worse if I just roll over or run.
[00:13:09.268 --> 00:13:10.048]  So here's the headline.
[00:13:11.109 --> 00:13:11.389]  It's in
[00:13:14.775 --> 00:13:16.096]  The news here, we need to go over it.
[00:13:18.218 --> 00:13:22.321]  The un-American campaign against Donald Trump by National Review.
[00:13:22.621 --> 00:13:38.173]  Now they're the same folks that said never Trump before and basically destroyed themselves, but now they admit this president's dangerous, this will destroy everybody, this will end free market capitalism, because just like Venezuela or so many other places, the communists will take everybody's wealth and transfer it to themselves.
[00:13:39.127 --> 00:13:45.169]  While promising the general public free tuition and crap like that, but there'll be no jobs or industry or systems to even be employed by.
[00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:47.710]  It's an excellent article.
[00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:53.372]  So when the National Review says, if Trump goes down, we all go down, you know it's dark, folks.
[00:13:54.612 --> 00:13:55.373]  You know it's dark.
[00:13:56.253 --> 00:14:04.836]  And Leticia James has said her next target is going to be small and medium-sized medical groups.
[00:14:06.018 --> 00:14:16.504]  Have you figured it out yet that BlackRock's sitting back with the Rothschilds and the Globalists and the Chaikovs, and they're going, okay, who are the groups that aren't totally controlled by us?
[00:14:16.844 --> 00:14:19.766]  Who are the corporations and divisions that we don't completely dominate?
[00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:22.988]  Sure, we make most of the money out of their industries, but we don't run them.
[00:14:23.708 --> 00:14:29.852]  Because how are they going to make you eat bugs if there's still all this major beef production and all these beef packing and meat packing industries?
[00:14:30.793 --> 00:14:33.514]  So again, they're shutting down the farmers worldwide.
[00:14:33.554 --> 00:14:34.395]  They're cutting off them.
[00:14:35.609 --> 00:14:36.210]  We're good to go.
[00:14:54.517 --> 00:15:06.644]  They've already done it with the blue cities and the blue states not passing laws where, oh, you can steal $2,000 to $5,000 depending on the state or the county or city that's passed the laws.
[00:15:07.945 --> 00:15:13.428]  When California passed those laws and all these other blue states passed these laws like New York, you can rob $2,000.
[00:15:13.488 --> 00:15:16.029]  You won't get in trouble.
[00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:17.350]  They just greenlit that.
[00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:18.331]  Well, how do those stores
[00:15:19.431 --> 00:15:27.639]  Whether they're Macy's with clothing or whether they're Walgreens with food and drugs and all the rest of it, none of them can survive, folks.
[00:15:27.659 --> 00:15:28.820]  But Amazon will be just fine.
[00:15:31.462 --> 00:15:31.983]  See how it works?
[00:15:33.604 --> 00:15:34.465]  That's a moving target.
[00:15:35.246 --> 00:15:42.452]  So, they're coming after all of the energy, the food, the food distribution, that's the grocery stores.
[00:15:43.593 --> 00:15:45.055]  They're devaluing your currency.
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.582]  They're creating massive crime waves defunding the police.
[00:15:49.063 --> 00:15:50.704]  Have you figured it out yet?
[00:15:52.847 --> 00:15:55.629]  The New World Order isn't coming, boys and girls.
[00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:56.550]  It's here.
[00:16:00.655 --> 00:16:02.516]  And when everything collapses, they're going to pose
[00:16:03.587 --> 00:16:07.409]  As the saviors and say, we're ready to take care of you.
[00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:09.991]  And what are they doing in New York and Illinois?
[00:16:10.131 --> 00:16:11.552]  The pilot test for the federal government.
[00:16:12.273 --> 00:16:17.876]  They're breaking ground on government grocery stores where only EBT cards work.
[00:16:20.238 --> 00:16:21.138]  Your food stamp card.
[00:16:22.459 --> 00:16:23.319]  Figured it out yet?
[00:16:23.339 --> 00:16:27.122]  Because they're going to have armed guards in there with machine guns.
[00:16:27.142 --> 00:16:29.383]  You're not going to have any robbery at the government store.
[00:16:30.464 --> 00:16:31.785]  That won't be tolerated there.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.832]  That's going to be federal through the state.
[00:16:36.578 --> 00:16:38.959]  And you're like, that is such a horrible plan, that is so evil.
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:43.042]  It is military conquest by the means of administration.
[00:16:43.943 --> 00:16:48.605]  The globalists are the administrators, and so they're... Turn the border off.
[00:16:50.046 --> 00:16:50.787]  Turn the police off.
[00:16:52.028 --> 00:16:54.229]  Turn the oil and gas drilling permits off.
[00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:57.791]  Turn the coal power plants off.
[00:16:57.891 --> 00:17:03.855]  Turn down what the gas plants in cold weather or hot weather can produce with caps, so there's rolling blackouts.
[00:17:07.008 --> 00:17:08.129]  Turn the value of the dollar down.
[00:17:13.552 --> 00:17:24.219]  They're coming after everything, and that's why this ruling by the Supreme Court that we'll cover now is so important.
[00:17:24.439 --> 00:17:30.283]  But first, I even catch myself, because I'm a fighter, 30 years in April.
[00:17:33.263 --> 00:17:35.285]  Lying to myself, saying, look, you've done your job.
[00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:36.347]  You've been around 30 years.
[00:17:36.467 --> 00:17:37.788]  You don't have to keep this operation going.
[00:17:37.808 --> 00:17:39.090]  You don't have to keep fighting so hard.
[00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:40.251]  You've done your job.
[00:17:40.271 --> 00:17:41.132]  People are waking up now.
[00:17:41.472 --> 00:17:44.376]  You can just kind of subside and go away.
[00:17:47.779 --> 00:17:53.905]  That is my personal weakness with the devil sitting there programming that area of my mind he's able to connect to.
[00:17:53.965 --> 00:17:54.165]  No.
[00:17:54.605 --> 00:17:56.467]  Now is the ultimate time in the battle.
[00:17:56.527 --> 00:17:58.109]  Now is the time of our greatest credibility.
[00:17:58.429 --> 00:17:59.830]  Now is the time we've been proven right.
[00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:01.872]  Now is the time we have the greatest influence.
[00:18:01.952 --> 00:18:05.776]  Now is the time to do everything we can in the fight against the globalists.
[00:18:06.136 --> 00:18:07.958]  But to do that, I've got to talk directly to the audience.
[00:18:08.618 --> 00:18:09.739]  Look, Donald Trump's tough.
[00:18:09.879 --> 00:18:10.240]  I'm tough.
[00:18:11.536 --> 00:18:12.777]  And it's guys that are pretty tough.
[00:18:12.817 --> 00:18:15.839]  I mean, I'm thinking of myself as a little bit above average.
[00:18:15.859 --> 00:18:16.659]  Let's put it to you that way.
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.081]  Especially when it comes to the department of not giving up.
[00:18:21.442 --> 00:18:25.885]  You might start kicking my ass the first minute, the second, third, and fourth minute, you're gonna be dying.
[00:18:26.785 --> 00:18:27.426]  Or I'm gonna be dead.
[00:18:28.186 --> 00:18:28.767]  Put it to you that way.
[00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:30.828]  So that's an allegory of the rest of the way I live my life.
[00:18:33.409 --> 00:18:34.770]  I can't do this without you.
[00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.672]  And I sit there and do the accounting and the numbers and all that.
[00:18:37.712 --> 00:18:38.393]  I'm not bitching.
[00:18:38.773 --> 00:18:40.414]  But if you don't want to keep me on the field,
[00:18:42.051 --> 00:18:47.872]  As a weapon against the globalists, then don't spread the articles, don't spread the videos, don't pray for us, and don't buy the products.
[00:18:49.513 --> 00:18:53.034]  If you want to support us, get TurboForce 10-hour clean energy.
[00:18:53.194 --> 00:18:53.794]  It's amazing.
[00:18:54.074 --> 00:18:54.714]  TurboForce.
[00:18:55.474 --> 00:18:58.935]  If you want to support us, get next-level foundational energy that isn't a stimulant.
[00:18:59.635 --> 00:19:06.677]  It cleans out the cells and is the breakdown of key compounds in the body that give you energy, namely
[00:19:08.783 --> 00:19:09.504]  Folic acid.
[00:19:09.644 --> 00:19:14.169]  But it's the breakdown, the pure form of that, that totally metabolizes instantly by your cells.
[00:19:14.209 --> 00:19:15.831]  Get next level foundational energy.
[00:19:15.871 --> 00:19:16.952]  Get turbo force.
[00:19:19.836 --> 00:19:20.016]  Get...
[00:19:22.423 --> 00:19:28.827]  Nitric boosts that everybody needs to clean out your blood and your brain and your arteries and your capillaries and your veins and your lungs.
[00:19:28.927 --> 00:19:29.688]  It's amazing.
[00:19:29.728 --> 00:19:32.550]  You heard Judy Mikovits, the doctor, say this is the best formula out there.
[00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:37.813]  That's something you need and that's something we need to fund the operation.
[00:19:37.873 --> 00:19:40.495]  Get a book, get a film, get our t-shirt, Team Humanity.
[00:19:41.482 --> 00:19:46.486]  How cool is it, Alex Jones and Elon Musk together on air, come up with a slogan, Team Humanity Against the New World Order.
[00:19:46.746 --> 00:19:47.647]  We put a t-shirt out.
[00:19:47.707 --> 00:19:50.549]  I mean, it's been an okay seller, but I would think we sell a lot more.
[00:19:50.929 --> 00:19:53.711]  Get the new Gadsden flag red, white, and blue shirt I designed.
[00:19:54.051 --> 00:19:55.092]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:19:55.393 --> 00:19:57.054]  We need action, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:59.095 --> 00:20:02.118]  It takes money to wage a war like this.
[00:20:02.198 --> 00:20:06.401]  We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for whoever made that Bitcoin donation two years ago, and I salute you.
[00:20:08.191 --> 00:20:11.052]  And it's our sponsors that also make it possible.
[00:20:11.473 --> 00:20:14.094]  So when you support our sponsors, you support this broadcast.
[00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:21.478]  You need to go to drjonesnaturals.com if you want to support this show, plus its incredible products.
[00:20:21.898 --> 00:20:34.364]  You need to go to drjonesnaturals.com and you need to get the original, now back in stock, now available up to three years, Nano Silver Super Blue Toothpaste with Tea Tree Oil.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.466]  And iodine at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:20:40.287 --> 00:20:42.911]  drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:20:43.591 --> 00:20:48.298]  Just the initials, drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:20:48.939 --> 00:20:50.341]  And it's not just the super blue.
[00:20:51.246 --> 00:20:54.707]  Original Nano Silver Iodine Tea Tree Toothpaste.
[00:20:55.088 --> 00:20:55.888]  That's a concentrate.
[00:20:56.448 --> 00:21:10.174]  It's all the other great toothpaste and it is all the other great silver products like Immune Gargle that is so good for you and the Immune with Nano Silver Gel and a bunch of other great supplements and products that are non-silver.
[00:21:10.854 --> 00:21:13.175]  Most of it that's there is not available at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:21:13.195 --> 00:21:16.156]  There's a lot of the things you love at InfoWareStore.com that are available there.
[00:21:16.577 --> 00:21:17.237]  They're available.
[00:21:18.846 --> 00:21:21.248]  At drjonesnationals.com, and I'll tell you why.
[00:21:21.268 --> 00:21:27.853]  About a year ago, the bankruptcy was like, well, you don't have the money to buy these products that were best sellers, so you can't have those anymore.
[00:21:27.873 --> 00:21:29.054]  My dad's like, fine.
[00:21:29.234 --> 00:21:30.455]  I'll go buy the products again.
[00:21:30.875 --> 00:21:31.856]  I've got a shopping cart.
[00:21:32.016 --> 00:21:33.958]  I'll sell them, and I'll be a sponsor to keep you on air.
[00:21:35.171 --> 00:21:41.473]  So, it's keeping InfoWars in the air when you go to drjonesnaturals.com, plus the products are amazing.
[00:21:41.633 --> 00:21:50.716]  InfoWarsStore.com has all the other great products that you won't find at drjonesnaturals.com, drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:21:51.536 --> 00:21:53.337]  And it's all there, drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:21:54.349 --> 00:22:03.455]  And the biggest thing to get, because it works so great and it's amazing, is TurboForce, 10-hour clean energy, TurboForce, 10-hour clean energy, and then fullwarestore.com.
[00:22:03.475 --> 00:22:05.116]  But, I mean, it's that simple.
[00:22:05.436 --> 00:22:12.840]  People think of us as tough and as always here, and as just impervious and unstoppable, and we are not, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:20.185]  We are up against Soros and the CIA and the New World Order and all their attacks, but they're not that powerful when it comes to you.
[00:22:20.945 --> 00:22:26.887]  But Trump and Alex Jones cannot stand against the globalists if you don't support us.
[00:22:27.287 --> 00:22:33.209]  And Trump's not perfect, and I'm not perfect, but we're against the New World Order, and we want prosperity, and we want freedom, and we want justice and security.
[00:22:34.209 --> 00:22:35.389]  And I tell you, support Trump.
[00:22:35.849 --> 00:22:37.990]  They're destroying him.
[00:22:39.298 --> 00:22:40.778]  They are taking everything he's got.
[00:22:40.838 --> 00:22:41.599]  He's happy to do it.
[00:22:41.999 --> 00:22:46.100]  But when it comes to, they brag, oh, he's not raising any campaign money.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:49.181]  You know, Biden's outperforming him three to one.
[00:22:50.221 --> 00:22:54.202]  Yeah, well, even though they got three, four times the money, he's kicking your dirty asses.
[00:22:54.922 --> 00:22:57.923]  But you better support him.
[00:22:58.283 --> 00:23:00.224]  They're coming for you, people.
[00:23:00.744 --> 00:23:02.224]  You better tell people about the show.
[00:23:02.264 --> 00:23:03.044]  And I'm not bitching.
[00:23:03.285 --> 00:23:05.945]  We are so close to winning.
[00:23:06.005 --> 00:23:08.286]  Jordan Peterson sounds like Alex Jones now.
[00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:13.051]  Joe Rogan says it's a spiritual war, we need Jesus.
[00:23:13.751 --> 00:23:15.792]  Tucker Carlson says Alex Jones woke me up.
[00:23:19.534 --> 00:23:20.594]  We're delivering.
[00:23:21.095 --> 00:23:22.555]  God put us in this position.
[00:23:22.895 --> 00:23:26.837]  We can do it, but I can't do it without you.
[00:23:29.538 --> 00:23:30.378]  I need your help.
[00:23:32.379 --> 00:23:38.562]  I don't spend a fraction of the time telling you the dirty tricks and the crap they do because I expect it and I actually like it.
[00:23:39.431 --> 00:23:51.441]  Not that I like pain, not that I like the Nationalists, not that I like my family getting hurt, but at a level of war, I know we have together kicked the living shit out of the globalists.
[00:23:52.361 --> 00:23:53.863]  And I intend to continue doing that.
[00:23:54.663 --> 00:23:55.304]  Until the end.
[00:23:55.404 --> 00:23:56.184]  The Alamo, baby.
[00:23:57.926 --> 00:23:59.187]  But I cannot do it without you.
[00:23:59.247 --> 00:24:02.810]  And so, I sit here all the time and I go, I want to cover all this news, I don't want to get on air and beg.
[00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:04.151]  But you know what, it's not begging.
[00:24:05.529 --> 00:24:06.910]  I'm calling for your aid.
[00:24:07.511 --> 00:24:09.012]  I'm calling for your comfort.
[00:24:09.632 --> 00:24:10.993]  I'm calling for your support.
[00:24:11.554 --> 00:24:12.595]  That's what aid and comfort is.
[00:24:12.615 --> 00:24:16.758]  When you're in a war, that's what the movie The Patriot's about with Mel Gibson.
[00:24:16.778 --> 00:24:17.098]  Great film.
[00:24:17.118 --> 00:24:17.999]  I watched it again last week.
[00:24:18.279 --> 00:24:19.080]  Hadn't seen it in 10 years.
[00:24:21.001 --> 00:24:21.902]  Came out like 20 years ago.
[00:24:21.942 --> 00:24:23.443]  Hard to believe it's that long ago.
[00:24:23.603 --> 00:24:26.886]  And that's a composite of The Swamp Fox and three other stories in Virginia.
[00:24:26.926 --> 00:24:29.267]  So they combine three true stories together.
[00:24:29.508 --> 00:24:30.408]  That whole movie's true.
[00:24:30.709 --> 00:24:32.810]  Real people, real names, real everything.
[00:24:33.271 --> 00:24:33.611]  Look it up.
[00:24:37.017 --> 00:24:48.845]  And one of the composite stories is one of the guys that really gave the British hell in Virginia, who'd been a red coat, served them, and they came by his house and burned it down just because they had given some food and stuff to some of the rebels and killed one of his kids.
[00:24:49.365 --> 00:24:50.065]  You know the movie.
[00:24:50.145 --> 00:24:50.866]  It's a real story.
[00:24:53.788 --> 00:24:57.550]  Well, what did they shoot the kid for?
[00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:59.111]  What'd they burn the property down for?
[00:25:01.613 --> 00:25:02.453]  Giving aid and comfort.
[00:25:03.334 --> 00:25:03.514]  Well,
[00:25:04.676 --> 00:25:07.037]  Yeah, the globalists are coming after everybody, folks.
[00:25:07.057 --> 00:25:08.377]  They'll probably come after you.
[00:25:08.798 --> 00:25:10.578]  You've got to make a decision.
[00:25:10.838 --> 00:25:12.779]  You're going to live on your knees and lick their boots?
[00:25:13.299 --> 00:25:17.061]  Or when we're so close to beating these people, are you going to give us aid and comfort?
[00:25:19.242 --> 00:25:19.962]  Aid and comfort.
[00:25:20.962 --> 00:25:22.123]  I need your aid and comfort.
[00:25:23.786 --> 00:25:28.150]  I mean, if we were a submarine in World War II, it's like we've sunk 200 ships.
[00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:29.210]  No submarine ever did that.
[00:25:29.591 --> 00:25:30.812]  But I mean, it's that level.
[00:25:30.832 --> 00:25:38.598]  Like this broadcast, our crew, the guests we have, like old fighter planes would have all the planes they'd shot down or ships they'd sunk on the side.
[00:25:38.618 --> 00:25:40.039]  This would be like an airplane covered.
[00:25:40.079 --> 00:25:46.685]  The wings, under it, the tail, the fuselage is just covered with what we've blown up in the Info War.
[00:25:47.225 --> 00:25:56.309]  God did that through this broadcast, but we are the meanest, most effective, most accurate weapon system against the New World Order, and people just take it for granted.
[00:25:56.349 --> 00:25:57.230]  Oh, there goes Alex.
[00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:57.910]  Ha ha, yeah.
[00:25:58.250 --> 00:25:59.070]  Glad he's with us.
[00:25:59.151 --> 00:25:59.831]  Yeah, boy.
[00:26:01.151 --> 00:26:02.352]  Just like Trump comes off.
[00:26:02.392 --> 00:26:02.992]  He's strong.
[00:26:03.032 --> 00:26:03.553]  He's tough.
[00:26:03.593 --> 00:26:04.253]  He's focused.
[00:26:04.273 --> 00:26:04.893]  That's why they hate him.
[00:26:05.233 --> 00:26:06.434]  He needs your prayer, folks.
[00:26:06.474 --> 00:26:07.294]  He needs your support.
[00:26:07.774 --> 00:26:08.375]  And I do, too.
[00:26:09.015 --> 00:26:09.715]  And I need it now.
[00:26:10.896 --> 00:26:15.238]  This is an urgent time, and you're going to see incredible things happen in the next nine months.
[00:26:17.128 --> 00:26:19.430]  But, I'm done talking about this.
[00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:21.371]  I just need you to go to mfullwarrestore.com.
[00:26:21.391 --> 00:26:24.293]  I need you to go to drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:26:24.313 --> 00:26:26.235]  I need you to get the products.
[00:26:26.275 --> 00:26:27.416]  I need you to support what we're doing.
[00:26:27.436 --> 00:26:28.817]  I need you to pray for the broadcast.
[00:26:28.857 --> 00:26:33.440]  And I need you to take the articles and the videos on your email list and you pick what you want to send out.
[00:26:34.601 --> 00:26:36.162]  What you think is most informative for your family.
[00:26:36.783 --> 00:26:37.463]  Maybe they're farmers.
[00:26:37.483 --> 00:26:38.284]  Send them an article about that.
[00:26:39.225 --> 00:26:39.925]  Maybe they're ranchers.
[00:26:40.285 --> 00:26:43.147]  Send them our videos about Leticia James coming out to beat Packers.
[00:26:43.368 --> 00:26:44.148]  That means after you.
[00:26:44.989 --> 00:26:46.310]  Because you're just upstream from that.
[00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:50.192]  You're the source.
[00:26:50.232 --> 00:26:58.319]  Whatever friends and family, whatever people you have that different articles and stories resonate with, that's up to you to decide.
[00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.021]  But send it out on your email list.
[00:27:00.081 --> 00:27:01.262]  Send it out on your text messages.
[00:27:01.683 --> 00:27:02.703]  Call and talk radio.
[00:27:02.723 --> 00:27:03.544]  Plug InfoWars.
[00:27:04.725 --> 00:27:06.287]  And support our local affiliates.
[00:27:06.327 --> 00:27:08.869]  If you're listening to us on a local station, call them and thank them.
[00:27:09.009 --> 00:27:10.090]  Call their sponsors and thank them.
[00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:11.011]  Become a sponsor.
[00:27:12.012 --> 00:27:13.874]  You own a car dealership or a restaurant.
[00:27:14.821 --> 00:27:18.485]  Or you run a church in the town and you hear the show on there for years.
[00:27:19.185 --> 00:27:19.646]  Call up.
[00:27:19.686 --> 00:27:21.748]  Maybe it's a small advertising package.
[00:27:21.768 --> 00:27:22.428]  Maybe it's a big one.
[00:27:22.708 --> 00:27:23.469]  But support!
[00:27:23.549 --> 00:27:25.211]  We're in a war, people!
[00:27:25.972 --> 00:27:31.317]  And we can overpower George Soros and the globalists if you wake up and get engaged.
[00:27:32.738 --> 00:27:35.841]  Less than 1% of our gigantic audience ever buys anything.
[00:27:37.165 --> 00:27:38.927]  It's even worse for that for mainstream media.
[00:27:39.207 --> 00:27:40.688]  Nobody buys their crap anymore.
[00:27:41.389 --> 00:27:46.514]  But imagine if 1% more of you just went to drjonesnationals.com, drjonesnationals.com.
[00:27:46.834 --> 00:27:48.376]  Imagine if you went to mfolerstore.com.
[00:27:48.696 --> 00:27:51.719]  Imagine what would happen if you did that.
[00:27:52.019 --> 00:27:54.942]  Imagine how if you every day shared the articles and videos.
[00:27:54.982 --> 00:27:56.283]  I know a lot of you are saying, we do.
[00:27:57.004 --> 00:28:00.788]  Well, those of you that have been doing that are the reason we've had all this success!
[00:28:02.995 --> 00:28:03.875]  I don't get the credit.
[00:28:04.175 --> 00:28:05.156]  You don't get the credit.
[00:28:05.556 --> 00:28:06.576]  God gets the credit.
[00:28:06.616 --> 00:28:07.877]  But God's been working through us.
[00:28:07.937 --> 00:28:08.937]  It's not about credit.
[00:28:09.337 --> 00:28:11.538]  It's about defeating these globalists that are on our backs.
[00:28:11.778 --> 00:28:13.979]  It's about standing up and taking on the New World Order.
[00:28:15.479 --> 00:28:16.740]  And history's happening now.
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:22.562]  Don't wait and later wish you'd done something or we'll live in a place way worse than the Soviet Union.
[00:28:23.649 --> 00:28:25.851]  The opportunity where we can go is so incredible.
[00:28:26.312 --> 00:28:27.933]  The downside is hell itself.
[00:28:28.634 --> 00:28:35.001]  And we are in the position, in the fulcrum, in the crossroads, in the historical point right now of decision.
[00:28:35.021 --> 00:28:38.204]  We've already crossed the point of return.
[00:28:38.224 --> 00:28:39.045]  The New World Order is here.
[00:28:39.906 --> 00:28:41.708]  Now the question is, what are we going to do to it?
[00:28:42.875 --> 00:28:44.036]  Are we gonna bow down to it?
[00:28:44.656 --> 00:28:45.457]  And be destroyed by it?
[00:28:45.477 --> 00:28:51.321]  Or are we gonna come together and have our greatest moments ever, and please God, and ensure the future for our progeny?
[00:28:51.842 --> 00:28:56.806]  It's about our children, and our grandchildren, their children, and it's DO OR DIE TIME!
[00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:05.072]  We have products that'll change your life, that are amazing.
[00:29:06.013 --> 00:29:08.815]  I wanna sell you products that really work, so you want them again.
[00:29:09.815 --> 00:29:11.777]  But if you don't support us, we won't be here.
[00:29:13.223 --> 00:29:16.966]  Plus, you really need Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, 95% curcuminoid.
[00:29:17.526 --> 00:29:20.368]  The strongest other top brands are 75-80%.
[00:29:20.648 --> 00:29:21.329]  Nobody makes it 95.
[00:29:21.449 --> 00:29:23.650]  We went to the top, one of the top makers.
[00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:24.911]  We said, we want the strongest you can make.
[00:29:25.231 --> 00:29:27.153]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, 40% off.
[00:29:27.533 --> 00:29:28.574]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:29:29.134 --> 00:29:30.035]  We have Nitric Boost.
[00:29:31.256 --> 00:29:31.436]  40% off.
[00:29:31.476 --> 00:29:33.037]  We've been selling Nitric Boost for a couple years.
[00:29:33.057 --> 00:29:36.219]  Never had it below $25 because there was hardly any profit there.
[00:29:36.279 --> 00:29:39.181]  We went to a place that gives us stuff just as good or even better.
[00:29:39.201 --> 00:29:40.122]  That's where we're getting it from.
[00:29:40.683 --> 00:29:43.465]  And it's 40% off passing the savings on to you.
[00:29:44.065 --> 00:29:44.626]  Nitric Boost.
[00:29:44.666 --> 00:29:45.466]  You need to experience it.
[00:29:45.486 --> 00:29:45.987]  You need to take it.
[00:29:46.527 --> 00:29:49.569]  So, infowarestore.com for Nitric Boost.
[00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:54.573]  And so many other great products as well, like Turbo Force 10-hour clean energy back in stock.
[00:29:55.153 --> 00:29:57.015]  Infowarestore.com, Turbo Force.
[00:30:00.094 --> 00:30:05.817]  I'm not perfect, and I'm under a lot of stress, but if I didn't have the supplements we have, we promote, I wouldn't be able to continue to be on air.
[00:30:06.398 --> 00:30:14.522]  And when you go to mFullWarStore.com, you are funding the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists in an operation that the enemy admits has been the most effective at exposing them.
[00:30:14.722 --> 00:30:16.263]  Because we're fearless, and we don't back down.
[00:30:16.683 --> 00:30:17.584]  We got God on our side.
[00:30:17.964 --> 00:30:19.465]  But God needs to work through you.
[00:30:19.805 --> 00:30:25.108]  You've got to make the decision to get great products you already need at mFullWarStore.com, and that is a 360 win.
[00:30:25.708 --> 00:30:28.670]  Nitric Boost, without me even knowing, became our number three bestseller.
[00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:30.951]  Because people loved it so much.
[00:30:30.971 --> 00:30:31.911]  They had such great effects.
[00:30:31.931 --> 00:30:38.373]  Got all these natural compounds that clean out the blood, open up your arteries and veins, encapillators, clean out your heart, your brain, everything.
[00:30:39.193 --> 00:30:40.934]  Well, we got an even better manufacturer.
[00:30:40.954 --> 00:30:45.776]  The other one was great, but one that's even better with even higher quality ingredients at a lower price.
[00:30:46.796 --> 00:30:49.199]  So I could never offer nitric boosts.
[00:30:49.219 --> 00:30:51.281]  It cost us so much to make.
[00:30:51.481 --> 00:30:53.703]  And now we can offer it for 40% off.
[00:30:54.264 --> 00:30:58.047]  Infowarrestore.com nitric boosts finally back in stock.
[00:30:58.067 --> 00:30:59.669]  40% off out of the gates.
[00:31:00.189 --> 00:31:02.732]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalist.
[00:31:03.092 --> 00:31:05.453]  And people can't identify who's a patron and who isn't.
[00:31:05.773 --> 00:31:08.915]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalist.
[00:31:08.975 --> 00:31:11.876]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.
[00:31:12.136 --> 00:31:22.721]  That's why I designed this amazing 1776 red, white, and blue Gadsden flag shirt so you can support the Infowar and meet like-minded people everywhere when you wear it.

[00:31:59.867 --> 00:32:00.788]  Hello, Americans.
[00:32:01.588 --> 00:32:03.230]  I want to share with you a story.
[00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:10.095]  A story about inflammation, the silent menace that lurks within our bodies, affecting our health and well-being.
[00:32:11.176 --> 00:32:16.961]  Inflammation, the root cause of countless ailments, quietly wreaking havoc over time.
[00:32:18.015 --> 00:32:22.077]  Long-term exposure to inflammation has been linked to a myriad of health issues.
[00:32:22.557 --> 00:32:25.718]  From heart disease to arthritis, even cognitive decline.
[00:32:26.719 --> 00:32:30.720]  But fear not, for there's a beacon of hope found in the wisdom of nature.
[00:32:31.401 --> 00:32:34.282]  A remedy that has stood the test of time, turmeric.
[00:32:35.074 --> 00:32:48.378]  And now I present to you Baudis from InfoWarStore.com, a powerful blend crafted with precision boasting 95% curcuminoids extracted from turmeric.
[00:32:48.478 --> 00:32:50.499]  It's good for your heart, your brain, everything.

[00:32:53.559 --> 00:32:55.620]  Baudis Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.181]  InfoWarStore.com.
[00:33:01.215 --> 00:33:07.162]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:12.848 --> 00:33:20.616]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:41.481 --> 00:33:43.864]  Alright, our plate is full of critical information.
[00:33:43.904 --> 00:33:47.949]  Trump is set to speak on Right Side Broadcasting any moment.
[00:33:47.989 --> 00:33:49.711]  We will go to him when he starts speaking.
[00:33:50.973 --> 00:33:55.438]  That's why networks like this are more important than ever to magnify what he's saying, because they black it out almost everywhere.
[00:33:55.919 --> 00:33:58.022]  Except for folks like Right Side and here at InfoWars.
[00:34:00.014 --> 00:34:05.837]  And you boost it, you override the enemy censorship when you decide to share the links at Real Alex Jones right now where we're live streaming.
[00:34:06.377 --> 00:34:09.079]  Elon Musk has given us a major beachhead in the fight against the enemy.
[00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:10.320]  I suggest we use it!
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.221]  It's a damn war, people!
[00:34:12.281 --> 00:34:13.281]  It isn't a freaking game!
[00:34:13.861 --> 00:34:14.842]  We've got everything on the line.
[00:34:15.222 --> 00:34:16.603]  And you may think I've got it on the line.
[00:34:16.903 --> 00:34:17.703]  You've got it on the line.
[00:34:17.723 --> 00:34:20.585]  They're coming after you and your children, and you know it's true.
[00:34:21.946 --> 00:34:23.206]  Where's your fighting spirit, folks?
[00:34:23.487 --> 00:34:24.127]  Where's your energy?
[00:34:24.607 --> 00:34:26.348]  We're starting to overpower the enemy.
[00:34:26.508 --> 00:34:27.729]  We're starting to get the initiative.
[00:34:29.585 --> 00:34:31.428]  I can smell their fear and failure!
[00:34:31.649 --> 00:34:32.911]  They stink like shit!
[00:34:33.672 --> 00:34:34.513]  Excuse my French.
[00:34:36.016 --> 00:34:37.459]  Alright, let's get into it right now.
[00:34:40.336 --> 00:34:41.116]  Devastating.
[00:34:41.276 --> 00:34:42.997]  I did not expect a 9-0.
[00:34:43.057 --> 00:34:44.918]  And I said this 50 times probably.
[00:34:44.958 --> 00:34:45.798]  I know you said it too.
[00:34:46.178 --> 00:34:49.779]  I said if there's any honesty by those Democrat judges, they don't look like clowns.
[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:51.620]  Those Democrat justices.
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:53.821]  They have to shoot this down.
[00:34:54.141 --> 00:34:55.321]  And you can read their ruling.
[00:34:55.401 --> 00:34:57.122]  It is so powerful.
[00:34:57.702 --> 00:35:03.284]  They say, we cannot believe we even have to state this for you, but here's the sections of the Constitution.
[00:35:04.605 --> 00:35:15.373]  He was never convicted of anything, he was never charged with anything, and we are ashamed of the court system that they would ever do something like this to discredit the courts.
[00:35:15.774 --> 00:35:16.354]  Damn right!
[00:35:16.374 --> 00:35:21.078]  The Supreme Court has legitimized itself to a great extent with this.
[00:35:24.481 --> 00:35:26.422]  There's not just evil in the universe, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:28.384 --> 00:35:30.185]  Look how the mainstream media spun it, Forbes.
[00:35:30.545 --> 00:35:33.428]  Trump can stay on all state ballots, Supreme Court amnesty rules.
[00:35:35.452 --> 00:35:44.516]  The real headline is, the incredible lawfare and criminal activity of weaponized courts and weaponized judiciary has been thoroughly rebuked by the Supreme Court.
[00:35:45.196 --> 00:35:46.857]  The whole house of cards begins to collapse.
[00:35:47.617 --> 00:35:49.478]  Here's the ruling, you gotta go read it for yourself.
[00:35:50.038 --> 00:35:52.339]  I scanned over it, only got it 30 minutes before showtime.
[00:35:53.619 --> 00:35:54.359]  Broadcast time.
[00:35:57.041 --> 00:35:57.981]  But it explains it all.
[00:35:59.181 --> 00:36:00.522]  Here's what, eight pages in.
[00:36:03.601 --> 00:36:11.165]  The representatives, the respondents, nonetheless maintain that states may enforce Section 3 against candidates for federal office.
[00:36:11.586 --> 00:36:20.491]  But the text of the 14th Amendment, on its face, prima facie, does not affirmatively delegate such a power to the states.
[00:36:21.731 --> 00:36:29.136]  The terms of the Amendment speak only to enforcement by Congress, which enjoys power to enforce the Amendment through legislation pursuant to Section 5.
[00:36:33.407 --> 00:36:41.933]  This can hardly come as a surprise, given that the substantive provisions of the amendment embody significant limitations on state authority.
[00:36:43.314 --> 00:36:48.078]  Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S.
[00:36:48.098 --> 00:36:48.398]  445-446-1976.
[00:36:48.578 --> 00:36:59.046]  Under the amendment, states cannot abridge privileges or immunities derived persona of life liberty.
[00:37:01.041 --> 00:37:04.122]  Deprived persons of life, liberty, or property.
[00:37:04.282 --> 00:37:05.542]  This is literal slavery.
[00:37:06.042 --> 00:37:09.243]  They say they're making Trump a slave, which is true!
[00:37:10.023 --> 00:37:16.025]  When you don't even get a jury trial, you've never been convicted, you're being stripped from being able to run for office, when you don't even have a misdemeanor.
[00:37:16.825 --> 00:37:18.145]  That's slavery, folks.
[00:37:20.026 --> 00:37:21.646]  This is incredible.
[00:37:23.947 --> 00:37:27.608]  Under the amendment, because the lawyers and the courts will make us slaves if they can.
[00:37:28.618 --> 00:37:29.939]  If they're not held on a short leash.
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:39.987]  Under the amendment, states cannot abridge privileges or immunities, deprive persons of life, liberty or property without due process.
[00:37:40.488 --> 00:37:42.730]  And they go on to say, you have removed due process.
[00:37:43.811 --> 00:37:52.498]  Deny equal protection or deny male inhabitants the right to vote without thereby suffering reduced representatives in the House.
[00:37:52.518 --> 00:37:54.139]  This is the original Constitution.
[00:37:55.841 --> 00:37:57.262]  And it just goes on and on, folks.
[00:37:59.169 --> 00:38:02.551]  I sped read this, scanned over it, I can speed read, but I just found a few.
[00:38:03.031 --> 00:38:03.791]  It's incredible.
[00:38:04.272 --> 00:38:07.493]  There's even more hardcore stuff in there.
[00:38:07.553 --> 00:38:09.454]  So, this is what they've done.
[00:38:11.175 --> 00:38:15.017]  And now it's completely blown up in their dirty, stinking faces.
[00:38:19.399 --> 00:38:21.059]  But it goes back to this headline.
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.441]  The un-American campaign against Donald Trump.
[00:38:26.038 --> 00:38:28.139]  And it's an un-American campaign against you.
[00:38:28.579 --> 00:38:45.986]  If they can take the President's rights, and take his right to run from office when he has no convictions, and is not convicted of the so-called insurrection, much less charged with it, well then how in Hades can this be done?
[00:38:46.026 --> 00:38:47.347]  And the answer is, it can't.
[00:38:47.387 --> 00:38:48.227]  So there's your headline.
[00:38:51.048 --> 00:38:52.629]  Supreme Court rules
[00:38:54.955 --> 00:38:58.636]  Democrat judges attempted to make Trump and the American people slaves.
[00:39:04.417 --> 00:39:05.037]  May I repeat again?
[00:39:06.878 --> 00:39:10.759]  You can't strip somebody of their process or rights and turn them into a slave.
[00:39:11.019 --> 00:39:11.659]  They just said that.
[00:39:11.719 --> 00:39:14.920]  You're a slave, folks, if you don't have any process and any rights.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:23.502]  If a court could just say, well, you've not been convicted of anything or even charged, but we just say, we wag our little magic wand
[00:39:27.296 --> 00:39:31.897]  George Soros says so, and since the CIA has overthrown all these other countries, we'll just overthrow you.
[00:39:31.917 --> 00:39:40.319]  The Supreme Court just told the new world order to pound sand, to piss up a rope, to fly a kite, to jump in the lake.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:53.663]  They just told them in the words of Elon Musk, you want to take my rights and intimidate me and tell me roll over and I'm your slave and I got to ask you what I can do and what I can't do?
[00:39:53.883 --> 00:39:55.343]  How about you go fuck yourselves?
[00:40:01.892 --> 00:40:03.493]  Go fuck yourselves.
[00:40:03.533 --> 00:40:04.694]  And excuse my French, folks.
[00:40:04.734 --> 00:40:05.395]  I don't need to use it.
[00:40:05.415 --> 00:40:06.495]  I've got a big vocabulary.
[00:40:06.536 --> 00:40:08.157]  But these are the times you say that.
[00:40:08.457 --> 00:40:09.238]  Because this is war.
[00:40:09.798 --> 00:40:13.180]  And when you're in a war, you add a little spice to things.
[00:40:13.841 --> 00:40:19.986]  This is the time to get serious and to underline and highlight what I'm saying and put a bunch of exclamation points behind it.
[00:40:20.166 --> 00:40:21.607]  But you can't do that with spoken word.
[00:40:21.947 --> 00:40:23.368]  You do that with a little profanity.
[00:40:24.529 --> 00:40:25.810]  So for that, I don't apologize.
[00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:27.511]  You get the kids out of the room if you don't like it.
[00:40:27.751 --> 00:40:28.912]  This is an adult broadcast.
[00:40:29.172 --> 00:40:30.914]  Let's go ahead and now go to the president live.
[00:40:39.093 --> 00:40:40.193]  Very important decision.
[00:40:40.253 --> 00:40:41.714]  We're very well crafted.
[00:40:42.754 --> 00:40:48.137]  And I think it will go a long way toward bringing our country together, which our country needs.
[00:40:49.397 --> 00:40:51.898]  And they work long.
[00:40:51.958 --> 00:40:52.638]  They work hard.
[00:40:53.039 --> 00:41:01.122]  And frankly, they work very quickly on something that will be spoken about 100 years from now and 200 years from now.
[00:41:01.362 --> 00:41:02.282]  Extremely important.
[00:41:03.303 --> 00:41:08.565]  Essentially, you cannot take somebody out of a race because an opponent would like to have it that way.
[00:41:09.808 --> 00:41:17.858]  And it has nothing to do with the fact that it's the leading candidate, whether it was the leading candidate or a candidate that was well down on the totem pole.
[00:41:18.218 --> 00:41:20.361]  You cannot take somebody out of a race.
[00:41:20.781 --> 00:41:23.645]  The voters can take the person out of the race very quickly.
[00:41:24.537 --> 00:41:29.142]  But a court shouldn't be doing that, and the Supreme Court saw that very well.
[00:41:29.303 --> 00:41:41.737]  And I really do believe that will be a unifying factor, because while most states were thrilled to have me, there were some that didn't, and they didn't want that for political reasons.
[00:41:42.987 --> 00:41:44.789]  Numbers because the poll numbers are very good.
[00:41:44.849 --> 00:41:49.374]  We're beating President Biden in almost every poll.
[00:41:49.714 --> 00:41:53.839]  New York Times came out yesterday with a very big poll for us.
[00:41:53.899 --> 00:41:56.442]  So they they didn't like that.
[00:41:56.562 --> 00:41:57.443]  And you can't do that.
[00:41:57.743 --> 00:41:58.844]  Can't do what they tried to do.
[00:42:00.067 --> 00:42:03.048]  And hopefully Colorado, as an example, will unify.
[00:42:03.068 --> 00:42:04.469]  I know there's tremendous support.
[00:42:04.609 --> 00:42:12.512]  They've brought our support up very strong in Colorado because people thought, people in Colorado thought that was a terrible thing that they did.
[00:42:13.372 --> 00:42:19.134]  And while we're on the subject, and another thing that will be coming up very soon, will be immunity for a president.
[00:42:19.214 --> 00:42:21.595]  And not immunity for me, but for any president.
[00:42:22.475 --> 00:42:37.143]  If a president doesn't have full immunity, you really don't have a president because nobody that is serving in that office will have the courage to make, in many cases, what would be the right decision or it could be the wrong decision.
[00:42:37.223 --> 00:42:42.686]  It could be, in some cases, the wrong decision, but they have to make decisions and they have to make them
[00:42:43.874 --> 00:42:49.479]  Free of all terror that can be rained upon them when they leave office or even before they leave office.
[00:42:49.599 --> 00:42:51.460]  And some decisions are very tough.
[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:55.483]  I can tell you that as a president that some decisions to make are very tough.
[00:42:55.583 --> 00:43:04.931]  I took out ISIS and I took out some very big people from the standpoint of a different part of the world.
[00:43:06.092 --> 00:43:11.836]  Two of the leading terrorists, probably the two leading terrorists ever that we've ever seen in this world.
[00:43:13.067 --> 00:43:14.869]  And those are big decisions.
[00:43:15.149 --> 00:43:16.811]  I don't want to be prosecuted for it.
[00:43:18.472 --> 00:43:21.055]  Another president wouldn't want to be prosecuted for it.
[00:43:21.735 --> 00:43:23.797]  It had a tremendously positive impact.
[00:43:23.877 --> 00:43:25.479]  It stopped everything cold.
[00:43:26.573 --> 00:43:30.855]  And sometimes you have to make, they were tough decisions, sometimes you have to make decisions like that.
[00:43:31.495 --> 00:43:42.560]  When you make a decision you don't want to have your opposing party or opponent or even somebody that just thinks you're wrong bring a criminal suit against you or any kind of a suit when you leave office.
[00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:45.561]  I have that right now at a level that nobody's ever seen before.
[00:43:45.641 --> 00:43:49.803]  I have rogue prosecutors and I have rogue judges.
[00:43:49.883 --> 00:43:51.684]  I have judges that are out of control.
[00:43:52.777 --> 00:44:02.063]  And it's a very unfair thing for me, but I'm serving perhaps as a sample to others of what should not be happening.
[00:44:02.083 --> 00:44:05.165]  When you make good decisions, and in my case, the economy was great.
[00:44:05.345 --> 00:44:06.506]  We didn't go into any wars.
[00:44:06.546 --> 00:44:07.887]  We totally defeated ISIS.
[00:44:09.388 --> 00:44:12.710]  We provided the largest tax cuts in history.
[00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:16.132]  We provided the largest regulation cuts in history.
[00:44:16.172 --> 00:44:17.193]  But think of it, no wars.
[00:44:19.727 --> 00:44:22.349]  Beat ISIS 100% of the caliphate.
[00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:23.711]  Then there were no wars.
[00:44:23.751 --> 00:44:27.054]  We did a job that was great, but maybe I wouldn't have done that.
[00:44:27.714 --> 00:44:31.157]  The caliphate, defeating them, was very powerful.
[00:44:31.198 --> 00:44:32.299]  It was going to take four years.
[00:44:32.359 --> 00:44:33.299]  It took me four months.
[00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:38.104]  But it was a very strong dictum that I gave.
[00:44:38.124 --> 00:44:39.725]  I said, get them.
[00:44:40.486 --> 00:44:40.986]  Defeat them.
[00:44:42.228 --> 00:44:42.488]  End it.
[00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:46.623]  We were fighting for 20 years against ISIS and we did it very quickly.
[00:44:47.264 --> 00:44:48.465]  I don't want to be prosecuted.
[00:44:48.505 --> 00:44:49.986]  In that case, it worked out very well.
[00:44:50.026 --> 00:45:03.278]  There will be some things that perhaps don't work out so well, but I don't want to be prosecuted because I decided to do something that is very much for the good of the country and actually for the good of the world.
[00:45:04.139 --> 00:45:11.782]  The president shouldn't have that on his mind and he has to have a free and clear mind when he makes very big decisions.
[00:45:12.423 --> 00:45:15.224]  Or it's going to be nothing more than a ceremonial post.
[00:45:15.464 --> 00:45:19.026]  You'll be president, it'll be a wonderful thing and you won't do anything because you don't want to be
[00:45:20.046 --> 00:45:26.429]  Hit by your opponent or hit by somebody else, because who wants to leave office and go through what I've gone through?
[00:45:26.449 --> 00:45:39.556]  I'm being prosecuted by Biden, my opponent, because every one of these things, whether it's Fannie Willis or Brad, these are local and state, but they're in total coordination.
[00:45:40.583 --> 00:45:41.344]  With the White House.
[00:45:41.364 --> 00:45:42.144]  You can't do that.
[00:45:42.465 --> 00:45:43.626]  It shouldn't be done.
[00:45:44.286 --> 00:45:55.595]  A thing like that, in the case of the DA's office, they put one of the top people, maybe the second person, in the Manhattan DA's office to get Trump.
[00:45:56.456 --> 00:46:07.565]  They had a Hillary Clinton lawyer leave the law firm, very prestigious big law firm, leave the law firm to go into the DA's office to get Trump.
[00:46:07.725 --> 00:46:08.305]  Pomerantz.
[00:46:09.206 --> 00:46:09.847]  Mr. Pomerantz.
[00:46:11.024 --> 00:46:22.712]  So he goes in to become a prosecutor, worked for the Democrat Party and Hillary Clinton, goes in to prosecute Donald Trump at a local level, in total coordination with the Department of Justice, meaning Biden.
[00:46:23.953 --> 00:46:29.517]  And then you have the Fannie Willis, or as she would say, Fannie, Fannie, F-A-N-N-I, but Fannie.
[00:46:30.637 --> 00:46:33.720]  And she hired somebody, knew the person long before.
[00:46:35.049 --> 00:46:35.269]  This is
[00:46:53.534 --> 00:46:55.977]  And they had obviously a conflict.
[00:46:55.997 --> 00:46:57.018]  We don't have to go into that.
[00:46:57.098 --> 00:47:00.822]  But they were able to get a lot of money because it was a high profile person.
[00:47:00.862 --> 00:47:02.584]  Me, I'm a very high profile person.
[00:47:03.225 --> 00:47:08.730]  So they were able to pay him close to a million dollars when he was not equipped to do the job.
[00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:10.392]  And she's not equipped to do the job.
[00:47:10.432 --> 00:47:11.754]  And that case should end immediately.
[00:47:11.794 --> 00:47:14.356]  That case is so conflicted, nobody's ever seen anything.
[00:47:15.643 --> 00:47:16.003]  Like it.
[00:47:16.444 --> 00:47:21.968]  And then you have deranged Jack Smith, who's a Trump hater, and represents all the Trump haters.
[00:47:22.809 --> 00:47:23.950]  And he's going wild.
[00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:24.991]  He's just a wild man.
[00:47:25.031 --> 00:47:27.573]  He's been overturned unanimously by the Supreme Court.
[00:47:28.614 --> 00:47:30.115]  Went after other people over the years.
[00:47:30.155 --> 00:47:31.116]  He's a great failure.
[00:47:31.996 --> 00:47:34.458]  But he's mean, he's nasty, he's unfair.
[00:47:34.478 --> 00:47:36.740]  And the judges on these cases, they're all Trump haters.
[00:47:37.661 --> 00:47:40.983]  Other than we have maybe one or two that I think can be fair.
[00:47:41.957 --> 00:47:43.937]  But you look at New York, what's happened.
[00:47:44.017 --> 00:47:46.778]  I mean, these people have tremendous hatred.
[00:47:47.078 --> 00:47:48.679]  You can't do this to a president.
[00:47:48.739 --> 00:47:50.059]  And again, I'm not talking about me.
[00:47:50.079 --> 00:47:51.359]  I'm talking about in the future.
[00:47:52.499 --> 00:47:54.740]  A president has to be free.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:58.361]  A president has to be if the president does a good job.
[00:47:58.461 --> 00:47:58.841]  I did.
[00:47:59.581 --> 00:48:01.001]  Some people would say a great job.
[00:48:01.881 --> 00:48:08.083]  But if the president does a good job, a president should be free and clear and frankly celebrated.
[00:48:08.971 --> 00:48:16.491]  For having done a good job, not indicted four times and not gone after on a civil basis and not
[00:48:18.052 --> 00:48:24.419]  Demanded to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in fines on something that was absolutely perfect.
[00:48:24.439 --> 00:48:25.360]  We don't want no victims.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.943]  With a financial statement that was absolutely flawless.
[00:48:29.224 --> 00:48:30.925]  We didn't write disclaimer clauses.
[00:48:30.945 --> 00:48:33.608]  Nobody's ever had to do this.
[00:48:33.708 --> 00:48:34.969]  I wasn't given a jury.
[00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:38.914]  And I had a clubhouse judge just come up with this number.
[00:48:39.952 --> 00:48:50.478]  On a perfect loan, and very conservative financial statements, but even at that, if you look, the disclaimer says, don't rely on the financial statements in any way, shape, or form.
[00:48:50.799 --> 00:48:52.460]  Go out and do your own work.
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:58.223]  The banking question had the most sophisticated lawyers in the world, frankly.
[00:48:58.423 --> 00:49:00.645]  One of the top law firms anywhere in the country.
[00:49:01.605 --> 00:49:02.886]  And they can defend themselves.
[00:49:03.746 --> 00:49:09.050]  Guys like Bragg, and Leticia James, and Fonny,
[00:49:10.373 --> 00:49:11.974]  And deranged Jack Smith.
[00:49:12.234 --> 00:49:15.516]  What they should be doing is fighting violent crime.
[00:49:16.557 --> 00:49:17.958]  And that would lead me to the end.
[00:49:17.978 --> 00:49:19.019]  I will say that.
[00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:24.742]  President Biden, number one, stop weaponization.
[00:49:25.583 --> 00:49:28.124]  Fight your fight yourself.
[00:49:28.645 --> 00:49:34.588]  Don't use prosecutors and judges to go after your opponent to try and damage your opponent so you can win an election.
[00:49:35.169 --> 00:49:36.630]  Our country is much bigger than that.
[00:49:37.674 --> 00:49:44.097]  The other thing I say to President Biden, close the borders now.
[00:49:45.077 --> 00:49:47.078]  This is not sustainable for our country.
[00:49:47.178 --> 00:49:48.959]  It's not sustainable for our cities.
[00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:52.101]  Our country is under siege.
[00:49:52.721 --> 00:49:57.063]  This is a violent thing that you've done.
[00:49:57.083 --> 00:49:58.984]  And many people are dying.
[00:49:59.844 --> 00:50:00.924]  Many, many people are dying.
[00:50:00.964 --> 00:50:01.945]  They die on the trip up.
[00:50:03.065 --> 00:50:06.107]  They die going through the border and they die in our country.
[00:50:07.708 --> 00:50:16.571]  But many of the people coming up are from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums.
[00:50:18.392 --> 00:50:18.832]  You see it.
[00:50:19.052 --> 00:50:20.052]  Many, many are terrorists.
[00:50:21.293 --> 00:50:25.894]  And I believe the real number that we have right now is probably closer to 15 million people.
[00:50:26.695 --> 00:50:35.578]  And by the time the term ends, I believe the President's term ends, I believe you'll be at close to 20 million people.
[00:50:37.008 --> 00:50:39.870]  That's almost larger than any state in the Union.
[00:50:40.911 --> 00:50:42.852]  Our country, it is not sustainable.
[00:50:43.893 --> 00:50:45.194]  Many of these people are tough.
[00:50:45.954 --> 00:50:46.975]  Many of these people are bad.
[00:50:47.015 --> 00:50:52.739]  They come from some of the roughest countries in the world, and some of the roughest prisons.
[00:50:52.939 --> 00:50:56.762]  We have prisons in the Congo, in Africa, coming.
[00:50:56.942 --> 00:50:59.264]  We have people coming from all parts of the Middle East.
[00:50:59.284 --> 00:51:02.646]  They're coming from Yemen, and yet we're bombing Yemen.
[00:51:03.703 --> 00:51:04.586]  You have to stop.
[00:51:04.626 --> 00:51:05.609]  You have to close the border.
[00:51:05.629 --> 00:51:07.293]  You have absolute authorization.
[00:51:07.353 --> 00:51:08.376]  You don't need Congress.
[00:51:08.437 --> 00:51:10.683]  I had the safest border in the history of our country.
[00:51:12.023 --> 00:51:13.823]  And I didn't use Congress for it.
[00:51:14.543 --> 00:51:16.764]  And then I built hundreds of miles of wall.
[00:51:16.804 --> 00:51:21.825]  And the reason I built it and how I built it was I considered it an invasion of our country.
[00:51:21.845 --> 00:51:23.505]  And I took the money from the military.
[00:51:23.685 --> 00:51:26.766]  And the Army Corps of Engineers did it with me.
[00:51:26.926 --> 00:51:28.166]  And we did a great job.
[00:51:29.106 --> 00:51:31.006]  And we had the safest border we've ever had.
[00:51:31.066 --> 00:51:32.687]  And now we have the most unsafe border.
[00:51:32.807 --> 00:51:36.707]  All right, there's our champion, Donald John Trump, under total globalist attack.
[00:51:36.767 --> 00:51:39.488]  And we are your field marshals here at InfoWars to fight.
[00:51:40.288 --> 00:51:43.412]  I just had this idea like 45 minutes ago at the start of the show.
[00:51:43.452 --> 00:51:44.573]  I said, we need to celebrate.
[00:51:44.693 --> 00:51:45.634]  I don't do this very often.
[00:51:45.995 --> 00:51:55.046]  The Supreme Court 9-0 is a signal they're going to kill all this crap and that there's enough people in the system that don't want to destroy America and don't want World War III.
[00:51:55.126 --> 00:51:56.007]  This is a big deal.
[00:51:57.188 --> 00:51:59.129]  I only pop champagne every four or five years on air.
[00:51:59.149 --> 00:52:04.251]  I think the last time I did it was in 2016 when I said, get rid of the enemies coming after us.
[00:52:04.632 --> 00:52:05.212]  Well, guess what?
[00:52:05.272 --> 00:52:06.653]  Now America knows it's under attack.
[00:52:06.693 --> 00:52:08.634]  So I asked any of the crew who wanted to come in.
[00:52:08.674 --> 00:52:10.134]  We got all these great folks here.
[00:52:10.154 --> 00:52:11.735]  Let's go to a wide shot if we can on the boom camera.
[00:52:11.755 --> 00:52:11.935]  Yeah.
[00:52:12.516 --> 00:52:20.099]  We got, you know, everybody in here from Rob Due to Harrison Smith and Chase Geyser to so many other great people like Darren McBreen in here with us right now.
[00:52:20.559 --> 00:52:25.342]  So I wanted to open this great bottle of French champagne right here and just commend everybody that, hey,
[00:52:26.502 --> 00:52:27.523]  We've turned the tide.
[00:52:27.743 --> 00:52:31.888]  We haven't won the war yet, but we're going to win in the end.
[00:52:31.908 --> 00:52:32.749]  The Globalists are done.
[00:52:32.789 --> 00:52:33.870]  It may be a pyrrhic victory.
[00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:37.373]  We all get killed in the process, but that's the worst case scenario.
[00:52:37.433 --> 00:52:37.994]  We've won.
[00:52:39.235 --> 00:52:40.877]  They have been defeated, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:41.317 --> 00:52:45.161]  So to all of you out there who supported us in this fight,
[00:52:46.058 --> 00:52:50.121]  And gone through hell, we salute you and we love you and we appreciate you.
[00:52:50.141 --> 00:52:54.064]  And we got a lot more fighting to do here, but I just wanted to pour some champagne here.
[00:52:54.605 --> 00:52:55.085]  Get over here.
[00:52:55.365 --> 00:52:57.407]  That's Scott Bronson, our main producer.
[00:52:58.468 --> 00:53:02.691]  Want to just tell you guys that I know when something's important, I think you do as well.
[00:53:03.191 --> 00:53:05.153]  This is a major, thank you.
[00:53:05.173 --> 00:53:06.354]  There's the great Ben.
[00:53:07.495 --> 00:53:11.017]  Does so much great work with us as a writer.
[00:53:12.238 --> 00:53:13.059]  She does work every day.
[00:53:14.363 --> 00:53:17.965]  Got one of the great producers right there, one of the crew members, Thomas right there with us.
[00:53:18.845 --> 00:53:24.628]  Just want to, again, just tell everybody, this is for the listeners, for President Trump, for the spirit of fighting against the tyrants.
[00:53:25.669 --> 00:53:26.789]  Got Diana McBreen right there.
[00:53:26.809 --> 00:53:29.010]  All the great editors and researchers.
[00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:30.911]  This is what it's all about.
[00:53:30.931 --> 00:53:33.712]  It's kicking New World Order asses, protecting our children.
[00:53:34.313 --> 00:53:34.933]  Chase Geyser.
[00:53:35.873 --> 00:53:37.934]  And to all of you out there, this is for you out there.
[00:53:37.954 --> 00:53:39.795]  Like I say, this, this Bud's for you folks.
[00:53:40.316 --> 00:53:42.877]  Well, this, this is for all of you out there, because we're not going to give up.
[00:53:43.817 --> 00:53:46.218]  But, you know, I don't want to fight and lose, but I'm not going to give up.
[00:53:47.018 --> 00:53:49.039]  There is no way I'm giving up.
[00:53:49.819 --> 00:53:51.559]  Harrison Smith and, of course, Rob Doom.
[00:53:51.579 --> 00:53:52.380]  We got a microphone.
[00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:53.760]  We'll go a little bit the next hour.
[00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:54.961]  I had Mike Leon coming on.
[00:53:54.981 --> 00:53:55.621]  He's a great guy.
[00:53:55.641 --> 00:53:59.722]  He's got his biggest snooze yet, literally breaking with all the UN invasion camps.
[00:53:59.742 --> 00:54:00.842]  But at least we know they're there now.
[00:54:00.902 --> 00:54:01.102]  See?
[00:54:01.543 --> 00:54:02.603]  Talk about it for decades.
[00:54:02.663 --> 00:54:04.203]  Now we're in full invasion.
[00:54:04.584 --> 00:54:07.284]  You know, before we were warning you what was coming and they were building it all.
[00:54:07.344 --> 00:54:07.885]  Now it's here.
[00:54:07.945 --> 00:54:11.166]  So my job gets a lot easier right now because hell's here.
[00:54:12.566 --> 00:54:21.134]  Here's the American people, here's the liberty lovers worldwide, here's everybody that doesn't want to roll over and be a slave and have your son's genitals cut off and your daughter's breasts cut off.
[00:54:21.535 --> 00:54:23.496]  I'm serious, they're coming for everything.
[00:54:23.937 --> 00:54:27.941]  Here's everybody that has resistance and loves God and wants freedom and wants to go to the stars.
[00:54:28.261 --> 00:54:35.388]  Here's to all of you and here's the Supreme Court with the unanimous decision, burn in hell New World Order and go fuck yourselves George Soros.
[00:54:43.487 --> 00:54:45.387]  We're in the fight, we're gonna win this sucker.
[00:54:45.407 --> 00:54:49.409]  Alright, let's pass the microphone around here and get everybody a quick comment on this situation.
[00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:52.011]  Well, I think the biggest thing is 9-0.
[00:54:52.271 --> 00:54:58.514]  When you got 9-0, it's bonafide, even the socialists voted for it, and that's a big sign, I think, for good things to come.
[00:54:58.894 --> 00:54:59.174]  Absolutely.
[00:54:59.194 --> 00:55:00.215]  Let's get a close shot for everybody.
[00:55:00.235 --> 00:55:01.935]  This really pisses the left off when we celebrate.
[00:55:02.316 --> 00:55:03.236]  Give me a close shot real quick.
[00:55:03.256 --> 00:55:06.698]  Cheers to everybody joining us, and confusion to our enemies.
[00:55:08.143 --> 00:55:08.503]  You know what?
[00:55:08.764 --> 00:55:11.746]  It emphasizes also what Trump was able to achieve with the Supreme Court.
[00:55:11.786 --> 00:55:15.488]  Can you imagine a Supreme Court stocked by Hillary Clinton at this point?
[00:55:15.528 --> 00:55:17.710]  So, every victory we're celebrating.
[00:55:19.351 --> 00:55:20.632]  Beautiful, beautiful day.
[00:55:20.692 --> 00:55:21.473]  Cheers to everyone.
[00:55:21.493 --> 00:55:23.634]  I've been waiting for this a long time.
[00:55:23.654 --> 00:55:25.436]  I agree with you.
[00:55:25.476 --> 00:55:31.500]  The 9-0 is crucial and I can't wait to see how CNN, MSNBC, and others try to spin it later today.
[00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:34.082]  Right, but it's only 9-0 this time, so.
[00:55:34.402 --> 00:55:35.543]  McBrain, the machine.
[00:55:36.023 --> 00:55:39.827]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a unanimous decision.
[00:55:39.847 --> 00:55:39.867]  9-0.
[00:55:43.590 --> 00:55:50.697]  And you're right, the fun part is going to start now when we see how the mainstream media and the establishment media is going to lose their minds.
[00:55:50.737 --> 00:55:52.718]  So liberals' heads are about to explode.
[00:55:52.878 --> 00:55:54.300]  That's always fun to watch, too.
[00:55:55.521 --> 00:55:57.282]  Well, that was the next point.
[00:55:57.342 --> 00:55:58.423]  I was about to say, what do they do?
[00:55:58.443 --> 00:55:59.765]  They're going to try to stack the court?
[00:56:01.147 --> 00:56:03.148]  And they said they're going to activate race riots.
[00:56:03.548 --> 00:56:06.849]  So let's love our black brothers and sisters and not do this.
[00:56:08.169 --> 00:56:10.510]  And this isn't just a victory for Trump.
[00:56:10.810 --> 00:56:15.612]  This is a victory for Team Humanity and for everybody that supports freedom around the world.
[00:56:16.012 --> 00:56:20.973]  We were calling upon everybody to celebrate this moment with us and we're going to keep celebrating throughout the year.
[00:56:21.033 --> 00:56:22.134]  Big victories are coming.
[00:56:22.274 --> 00:56:26.155]  Support InfoWars and cheers to everyone around the world right now.
[00:56:26.335 --> 00:56:26.715]  That's right.
[00:56:26.735 --> 00:56:29.456]  If you're in the fight for humanity, you're with InfoWars and Trump.
[00:56:30.316 --> 00:56:38.173]  I agree with everyone else saying the 9-0, it's a big bellwether, because that shows Colorado's antics were political more than anything, so Americans are waking up to that.
[00:56:41.104 --> 00:56:51.006]  I agree 9-0 is the biggest point to this because it was a lawsuit that was so frivolous and so pointless that even their judges couldn't figure out a way to defend it.
[00:56:51.866 --> 00:57:00.748]  And it just kind of shows that the Supreme Court is still the backstop that it's supposed to be for liberty on some level.
[00:57:00.808 --> 00:57:02.349]  They haven't totally taken over yet.
[00:57:02.789 --> 00:57:03.229]  Absolutely.
[00:57:03.649 --> 00:57:05.029]  Hard to kill America is.
[00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:08.730]  Hard to kill America is.
[00:57:10.805 --> 00:57:11.626]  Anything else, gentlemen?
[00:57:12.246 --> 00:57:13.587]  Let's go to break and come back with you guys.
[00:57:13.607 --> 00:57:16.008]  I want some more comments, because this is an important moment.
[00:57:16.308 --> 00:57:18.390]  Folks, I smell death in the New World Order.
[00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:19.971]  They want to take us with them, though.
[00:57:19.991 --> 00:57:20.611]  We are not out of this.
[00:57:20.631 --> 00:57:22.372]  They're going to hurt those of us on the tip of the spear.
[00:57:22.732 --> 00:57:27.415]  That's why we need your prayers, folks, because the enemy needs to get through us like the gates of a fortress.
[00:57:27.875 --> 00:57:36.681]  And they are battering around us, but the gates are still strong, only because you, like God created gravity, you are holding us in position against the enemy.
[00:57:37.141 --> 00:57:38.602]  Literally, you are the victory.
[00:57:38.962 --> 00:57:40.063]  You are the info war.
[00:57:40.703 --> 00:57:45.827]  But here is to the great Supreme Court ruling and the New World Order and all their tears.
[00:57:51.852 --> 00:57:54.334]  We have products that will change your life that are amazing.
[00:57:55.275 --> 00:57:58.097]  I want to sell you products that really work so you want them again.
[00:57:59.078 --> 00:58:01.040]  But if you don't support us, we won't be here.
[00:58:02.506 --> 00:58:06.229]  Plus, you really need Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, 95% curcuminoid.
[00:58:06.790 --> 00:58:09.632]  The strongest other top brands are 75-80%.
[00:58:09.932 --> 00:58:10.593]  Nobody makes it 95.
[00:58:10.713 --> 00:58:12.935]  We went to the top, one of the top makers.
[00:58:12.975 --> 00:58:14.196]  We said, we want the strongest you can make.
[00:58:14.516 --> 00:58:16.418]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, 40% off.
[00:58:16.798 --> 00:58:17.859]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:19.301]  We have Nitric Boost.
[00:58:19.921 --> 00:58:20.161]  40% off.
[00:58:20.201 --> 00:58:22.302]  We've been selling Nitric Boost for a couple of years.
[00:58:22.322 --> 00:58:25.484]  Never had it below $25 because there was hardly any profit there.
[00:58:25.544 --> 00:58:28.525]  We went to a place that gives us stuff just as good or even better.
[00:58:28.545 --> 00:58:29.405]  That's where we're getting it from.
[00:58:29.946 --> 00:58:32.747]  And it's 40% off, passing the savings on to you.
[00:58:33.347 --> 00:58:33.907]  Nitric Boost.
[00:58:33.947 --> 00:58:34.728]  You need to experience it.
[00:58:34.748 --> 00:58:35.268]  You need to take it.
[00:58:35.788 --> 00:58:38.830]  So, InfoWarsTore.com for Nitric Boost.
[00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:43.872]  And so many other great products as well, like Turbo Force, 10-hour clean energy back in stock.
[00:58:44.412 --> 00:58:46.293]  InfoWarsTore.com, Turbo Force.
[00:58:49.116 --> 00:58:51.377]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[00:58:51.537 --> 00:58:51.877]  Thank you.
[00:58:52.098 --> 00:58:54.639]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[00:58:54.719 --> 00:58:55.980]  I started taking that stuff.
[00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:59.201]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[00:58:59.321 --> 00:59:00.222]  When did you start taking it?
[00:59:00.502 --> 00:59:04.444]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[00:59:05.105 --> 00:59:21.005]  And I started eating a little better, but my blood pressure stayed high, and when I took the X2 iodine, after about three or four weeks, I think my body was detoxified of a bunch of metals and stuff that my body was storing, and my blood pressure came down to perfect level, and I tell people the only thing I did was X2 iodine.
[00:59:21.445 --> 00:59:35.330]  And even though I do think all your other products are good, I recommend to anybody that they start with X2 Iodine because it detoxifies your body and kind of kicks your natural DNA into full force.
[00:59:35.410 --> 00:59:38.871]  So, in my life, I found X2 Iodine the best.
[00:59:39.351 --> 00:59:42.792]  I tried other Iodines and they didn't have the same effect.
[00:59:43.092 --> 00:59:45.393]  So, X2 Iodine, I really wanted to point that out.
[00:59:50.993 --> 00:59:55.076]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:55.577 --> 00:59:56.898]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:00:09.136 --> 01:00:13.680]  Alright, we got some of the InfoWars crew in here with us right now.
[01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:16.302]  A lot of toxic masculinity.
[01:00:16.923 --> 01:00:19.925]  We have the great Michael Young coming up with this 9-0 vote.
[01:00:19.965 --> 01:00:29.353]  The Democrats voted saying, and I've read some of the ruling, slavery's illegal, taking somebody's rights, taking their right to run for office when they haven't been convicted or even charged is slavery.
[01:00:29.634 --> 01:00:32.856]  They quoted that, I showed that last hour, in the ruling.
[01:00:32.896 --> 01:00:33.757]  That's a big ol' guy.
[01:00:33.777 --> 01:00:34.438]  You want to comment on it?
[01:00:35.527 --> 01:00:44.710]  I think the biggest thing is this is filled with liberal tears right here and we're going to be drinking them up for the next few days but the war is not over but we did win a big battle.
[01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:58.554]  It's the function of checks and balances and the liberals are going to try to completely get rid of the court at this point because their lip service for democracy is utter crap and God bless America.
[01:00:58.574 --> 01:01:02.755]  Like Alex said, it's hard to kill America and yet another death blow was avoided here.
[01:01:03.536 --> 01:01:04.637]  Even if it was momentarily.
[01:01:04.677 --> 01:01:08.120]  And I also think we need some sort of punishment for attempted tyranny.
[01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:13.164]  I don't know how that would work, but you know they're just going to reform... This is like attempted robbery of our... Attempted murder.
[01:01:13.184 --> 01:01:16.546]  Just because somebody doesn't murder you doesn't mean you just go, alright, better luck next time.
[01:01:16.566 --> 01:01:16.867]  That's right.
[01:01:16.887 --> 01:01:18.848]  They try to say we can't vote for who we want.
[01:01:18.908 --> 01:01:20.950]  This is real election theft.
[01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:22.911]  Attempted election theft in front of us.
[01:01:23.352 --> 01:01:24.012]  Yep.
[01:01:24.072 --> 01:01:24.713]  Attempted tyranny.
[01:01:24.733 --> 01:01:26.594]  There's got to be some sort of function for that.
[01:01:26.614 --> 01:01:27.155]  I don't know what it is.
[01:01:27.175 --> 01:01:30.397]  And what did Bismarck say about America, the big Austrian-Hungarian
[01:01:32.122 --> 01:01:37.284]  Statesman, he said, God loves children, drunks the United States of America.
[01:01:39.664 --> 01:01:56.150]  Yeah, so obviously all their lip service to democracy has just been baloney and in the name of their allegations that the 2020 election was stolen or attempted to be stolen by Trump, they have attempted to steal the 2024 election through this lawfare, which is the great irony, I think, of this
[01:01:56.810 --> 01:02:01.113]  And you know, we don't get a lot of reason to celebrate all the time, but this is definitely one of them times.
[01:02:01.133 --> 01:02:02.514]  Last time we did this, Alex, 2016, we popped open champagne.
[01:02:02.534 --> 01:02:03.015]  But I'll never forget
[01:02:27.156 --> 01:02:36.082]  Jones, soon afterwards, we're all trying to celebrate, and then Alex is pretty soon, he's like, well, this is bad as well.
[01:02:36.583 --> 01:02:38.324]  Because they're really going to come after us now.
[01:02:39.365 --> 01:02:44.188]  And so there could be some blowback from this, attempted blowback, but we'll see what happens.
[01:02:44.568 --> 01:02:47.090]  Well, that's what we better start talking about, is how the enemy's going to attack.
[01:02:47.110 --> 01:02:49.071]  Yeah, because they're not done, obviously.
[01:02:49.091 --> 01:02:55.636]  They're pissed off, they didn't want this to be unanimous, and so now they figure they've got work to do, and they're coming.
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:10.053]  So last time InfoWars celebrated like this I was just a listener viewing at home and I just popped a beer open and cheers with the crew from home and I hope everyone else is doing that at home as well.
[01:03:11.094 --> 01:03:12.936]  But people have to get used to winning.
[01:03:12.976 --> 01:03:14.378]  We've been so demoralized.
[01:03:15.158 --> 01:03:15.958]  I think so.
[01:03:32.003 --> 01:03:32.664]  We're good to go.
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:01.283]  You're starting to get that feeling like we're starting to win, folks.
[01:04:01.343 --> 01:04:01.944]  It's happening.
[01:04:02.244 --> 01:04:02.864]  Momentum's there.
[01:04:02.905 --> 01:04:03.605]  Pull up, pull up.
[01:04:03.846 --> 01:04:05.367]  Death of Death Star, Admiral Ackbar.
[01:04:05.387 --> 01:04:08.491]  I don't know what the exact name of it is, but that's a perfect scene coming in.
[01:04:09.224 --> 01:04:15.008]  Oh yeah, and just to add to all this, the Liberty Movement's taking this W in stride because we know we've got a long election year ahead of us.
[01:04:15.868 --> 01:04:17.910]  Oh, they'll probably stage a mass shooting tomorrow.
[01:04:18.090 --> 01:04:30.558]  Oh yeah, so we're acknowledging for what it is, but there's still a lot of issues out there that are still really relevant on the tops of American minds like the open border, so I encourage everyone to stick around for Michael Yawn coming up very soon to give the latest on that.
[01:04:31.678 --> 01:04:32.058]  Stay there.
[01:04:32.418 --> 01:04:33.379]  We're going to come back next segment.
[01:04:33.619 --> 01:04:34.759]  We'll go back through everybody.
[01:04:35.419 --> 01:04:37.560]  We're at the end here with Scott Bronson.
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:38.601]  We'll go back through everybody else.
[01:04:39.861 --> 01:04:49.945]  So when we come back, try to find that clip with something like Super Star Destroyer, Destruction, Return of the Jedi.
[01:04:49.965 --> 01:04:52.205]  I want to play that clip because that's how I feel like Admiral Ackbar.
[01:04:53.226 --> 01:04:55.527]  The Death Star ain't blown up yet, but damn it's on fire.
[01:04:55.767 --> 01:04:56.287]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:01.994 --> 01:05:04.476]  We have products that will change your life that are amazing.
[01:05:05.416 --> 01:05:08.238]  I want to show you products that really work, so you want them again.
[01:05:09.219 --> 01:05:11.181]  But if you don't support us, we won't be here.
[01:05:12.662 --> 01:05:16.384]  Plus, you really need Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, 95% curcuminoid.
[01:05:16.945 --> 01:05:19.787]  The strongest other top brands are 75-80%.
[01:05:20.087 --> 01:05:20.767]  Nobody makes it 95.
[01:05:21.048 --> 01:05:23.089]  We went to the top, one of the top makers.
[01:05:23.129 --> 01:05:24.350]  We said, we want the strongest you can make.
[01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:26.572]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, 40% off.
[01:05:26.952 --> 01:05:28.013]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:05:28.553 --> 01:05:29.474]  We have Nitric Boost.
[01:05:30.695 --> 01:05:30.875]  40% off.
[01:05:30.895 --> 01:05:32.456]  We've been selling Nitric Boost for a couple years.
[01:05:32.556 --> 01:05:35.658]  Never had it below $25 because there was hardly any profit there.
[01:05:35.698 --> 01:05:38.661]  We went to a place that gives us stuff just as good or even better.
[01:05:38.681 --> 01:05:39.562]  That's where we're getting it from.
[01:05:40.102 --> 01:05:42.884]  And it's 40% off passing the savings on to you.
[01:05:43.525 --> 01:05:44.085]  Nitric Boost.
[01:05:44.105 --> 01:05:44.886]  You need to experience it.
[01:05:44.906 --> 01:05:45.426]  You need to take it.
[01:05:45.947 --> 01:05:48.989]  So, Infowarsstore.com for Nitric Boost.
[01:05:50.370 --> 01:05:54.013]  And so many other great products as well, like TurboForce 10-hour clean energy back in stock.
[01:05:54.573 --> 01:05:56.455]  Infowarsstore.com, TurboForce.
[01:06:00.296 --> 01:06:03.142]  The front lines of the information war.
[01:06:03.723 --> 01:06:05.045]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:06:24.850 --> 01:06:28.132]  All right, we got some of the crew in here, the folks that wanted to come on air.
[01:06:28.873 --> 01:06:33.196]  And we're going to be talking about how big this is.
[01:06:33.256 --> 01:06:41.822]  But a 9-0, meaning the Democrats knew it was so criminal, with no conviction, no indictment to strip him off the ballot, total election theft.
[01:06:42.282 --> 01:06:53.211]  The Democrats last week, the mouthpiece of the pedophile enemy, literally, literally Jeffrey Epstein run, the Atlantic, came out and said, we don't care if he wins, we're not going to accept it, and we're uncertified.
[01:06:53.292 --> 01:06:56.274]  That's what they indicted Trump for, but not for insurrection.
[01:06:57.055 --> 01:06:59.056]  So this is a huge deal, but they found the clip.
[01:06:59.097 --> 01:07:01.058]  Go ahead, and this is how I feel like Admiral Ackbar.
[01:07:01.078 --> 01:07:06.163]  They haven't blown up the second Death Star yet, but they destroy the Super Star Destroyer, it crashes into the Death Star.
[01:07:06.483 --> 01:07:07.223]  Roll it from the start.
[01:07:07.264 --> 01:07:07.544]  Go ahead.
[01:07:16.187 --> 01:07:17.668]  Lock on to the strongest power source.
[01:07:17.908 --> 01:07:21.889]  It should be the power generator.
[01:07:22.269 --> 01:07:22.629]  Form up.
[01:07:23.229 --> 01:07:23.610]  Stay alert.
[01:07:23.650 --> 01:07:25.010]  We could run out of space real fast.
[01:07:25.050 --> 01:07:34.173]  Now, plenty of this stuff is cheesy, but it's a good archetype of what we're doing.
[01:07:35.874 --> 01:07:40.415]  I mean, we're literally taking on the new world order, the CIA, all of them, and defeating them right now.
[01:07:40.455 --> 01:07:41.236]  They cannot stand it.
[01:07:41.256 --> 01:07:41.916]  We're taking the country back.
[01:07:41.956 --> 01:07:42.796]  Head back to the surface.
[01:07:43.396 --> 01:07:45.477]  See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you.
[01:07:46.897 --> 01:07:47.337]  Go, leader.
[01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:56.240]  I guess they got the full scene, but that's fine.
[01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:59.241]  It builds the suspense, because that's what the Supreme Court ruling is.
[01:08:00.121 --> 01:08:05.343]  It means they're gonna go against all the lawfare, all that's gonna be repudiated.
[01:08:05.843 --> 01:08:08.404]  Concentrate all fire on that superstar destroyer!
[01:08:13.726 --> 01:08:17.350]  And literally, ladies and gentlemen, they're going down.
[01:08:17.370 --> 01:08:21.233]  The CIA, the New World Order, this whole coup against us is over.
[01:08:21.634 --> 01:08:23.235]  No matter what happens to us, they're going down.
[01:08:24.716 --> 01:08:25.657]  Here comes M4s.
[01:08:30.642 --> 01:08:31.643]  Too late, bitches!
[01:08:33.385 --> 01:08:33.745]  It is.
[01:08:33.845 --> 01:08:35.667]  This is the only place that's the allegory.
[01:08:39.804 --> 01:08:42.086]  You can feel the tide turn.
[01:08:42.906 --> 01:08:43.867]  We have the initiative.
[01:08:44.127 --> 01:08:45.368]  They're going to stage mass shootings.
[01:08:45.388 --> 01:08:46.669]  They're going to try to start World War III.
[01:08:46.969 --> 01:08:48.470]  But at least we're going down fighting, folks.
[01:08:50.571 --> 01:08:51.992]  All right, that's good.
[01:08:53.473 --> 01:08:54.274]  Now they're about to blow it.
[01:08:54.614 --> 01:08:57.416]  All right, gentlemen, all closing comments here before we go to break.
[01:08:57.796 --> 01:08:59.597]  I'm going to take this break, because we need to take this break.
[01:08:59.958 --> 01:09:01.639]  And then we'll come back with Michael Yahn here in a minute.
[01:09:01.659 --> 01:09:01.939]  Go ahead.
[01:09:03.283 --> 01:09:13.192]  Yeah, I would just say that I think Colorado, when they went to the Supreme Court, their Supreme Court said that they unanimously decided that he could be taken off.
[01:09:13.252 --> 01:09:21.319]  And I think that also shows how important it is to pay attention to your local areas, because you have New York that is clearly just doing whatever they want to do.
[01:09:21.779 --> 01:09:23.220]  They're doing things to attack the
[01:09:24.721 --> 01:09:28.164]  The American citizen, and just ruin your everyday life.
[01:09:28.604 --> 01:09:35.429]  So, you know, they attack us on a global level, but they're extending well into our local areas.
[01:09:35.489 --> 01:09:37.430]  Leticia James is trying to take over the beef industry.
[01:09:37.450 --> 01:09:37.430]  100%.
[01:09:37.690 --> 01:09:48.538]  And if you think that you can have a strong society without beef, I would say go ahead and ask the Chinese when they were dealing with the Mongols.
[01:09:48.858 --> 01:09:52.660]  Beef is king when it comes to if you want to be big and strong.
[01:09:53.801 --> 01:10:00.323]  So, just pay attention to the local battles as well as the global battles that we're fighting.
[01:10:01.643 --> 01:10:08.545]  The unanimous ruling from SCOTUS ought to finally put to rest all the insurrection narratives they've been pushing on Trump these last couple years.
[01:10:08.786 --> 01:10:10.386]  Huge repudiation on January 6th.
[01:10:10.446 --> 01:10:20.449]  Tremendous, so I encourage everyone to go to their neighbor, friend, or relative who listens to MSNBC or CNN all the time to ask them which Supreme Court Justice they think is a Putin agent.
[01:10:23.815 --> 01:10:34.141]  I just want to say we have another big case coming up in the Supreme Court for Texas and whether or not Texas can arrest the immigrants and detain them and send them home.
[01:10:34.181 --> 01:10:37.603]  And that, I imagine, is going to go in our way as well.
[01:10:37.703 --> 01:10:40.385]  So again, just get ready for major victories.
[01:10:40.945 --> 01:10:41.565]  More victories to come.
[01:10:41.585 --> 01:10:44.246]  I've noticed that in local restaurants, stop at a bar, take a drink,
[01:11:03.243 --> 01:11:05.083]  Just hearing people's conversations.
[01:11:05.624 --> 01:11:07.444]  A lot different from a few years ago.
[01:11:07.544 --> 01:11:09.765]  People are definitely waking up.
[01:11:10.185 --> 01:11:14.226]  Alex will tell you that he walks down the street and people want their pictures taken with them.
[01:11:14.526 --> 01:11:20.727]  They've got nothing but good things to say when a few years ago, a lot of obscenities yelled at you, you know, towards your direction.
[01:11:21.327 --> 01:11:23.208]  So it's changing quite a bit.
[01:11:23.628 --> 01:11:28.549]  I hear people talking all the time about, well, even the Supreme Court decision.
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:37.285]  Yesterday we went to breakfast and we heard people talking about how unfair it is that this is happening to Trump and they're trying to steal the election.
[01:11:37.806 --> 01:11:40.668]  So this is the average conversation you're hearing nowadays.
[01:11:41.108 --> 01:11:42.249]  So that's a good sign.
[01:11:42.609 --> 01:11:43.309]  We are winning.
[01:11:43.469 --> 01:11:43.850]  That's right.
[01:11:43.870 --> 01:11:45.251]  These scumbags went too far, Darren.
[01:11:45.551 --> 01:11:45.931]  What's that?
[01:11:46.111 --> 01:11:46.752]  They went too far.
[01:11:47.112 --> 01:11:47.932]  Yeah, they went too far.
[01:11:48.052 --> 01:11:48.293]  Yeah.
[01:11:48.393 --> 01:11:56.338]  And people are pissed off and all walks of life because this was a Latino family that I overheard talking about it yesterday at breakfast.
[01:11:56.378 --> 01:11:59.240]  So good signs of more victories to come.
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:07.982]  You know, I talked about this a little bit last week when Harrison was out and he was gracious enough to have me substitute for him on his show, the American Journal.
[01:12:08.942 --> 01:12:09.702]  Weekdays, 8 a.m.
[01:12:09.722 --> 01:12:10.242]  to 11 a.m.
[01:12:10.262 --> 01:12:10.543]  Central.
[01:12:11.443 --> 01:12:26.006]  And I dream of the day that at Republican rallies or Trump rallies or whatever, patriotic rallies, we hear people, instead of shouting USA, USA over and over again, they shout America, America, America over and over again because I think with
[01:12:26.286 --> 01:12:28.248]  Yeah, we better be talking about how they're going to strike back.
[01:12:44.488 --> 01:13:01.126]  Well, you know, they tried to essentially punish a man for a crime he had not been convicted of, so this is a huge victory just for the mere basis of law and order and outside all of the legal arguments and political... That's right, people still remember Harrison due process.
[01:13:02.347 --> 01:13:06.150]  In some small regard, at least the Supreme Court seems to still hold on to it.
[01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:14.396]  But at the end of the day, outside of all the language that's used, this is pure and simple cheating, because they have to cheat to win, because they have nothing to offer the American people.
[01:13:14.536 --> 01:13:16.657]  All of their policies are crap.
[01:13:16.717 --> 01:13:20.080]  They all completely fail in horrific ways and make everything worse for everybody.
[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:23.582]  So they have to try to cheat to win, and that in and of itself is a victory.
[01:13:23.842 --> 01:13:29.406]  So we should take the victory, we should appreciate it, but we should also double down and know that it's not time to rest on our haunches.
[01:13:30.587 --> 01:13:33.228]  This is a beachhead, and we need to take the fight to them.
[01:13:33.528 --> 01:13:34.068]  That's my take.
[01:13:34.088 --> 01:13:34.648]  That's right.
[01:13:36.028 --> 01:13:41.170]  I would just like to say to the Krasenstein Brothers, 9-0 Supreme Court ruling.
[01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:41.770]  There you go.
[01:13:41.810 --> 01:13:45.251]  There's your ruling that you've been so looking for all this time.
[01:13:45.331 --> 01:13:46.571]  So cheers, everyone.
[01:13:52.693 --> 01:13:55.593]  Scott, everybody got to talk twice, but you always make great points.
[01:13:55.614 --> 01:13:57.294]  Go ahead and give Scott the microphone the last two minutes.
[01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:02.963]  Um, I really don't have anything else really to say.
[01:14:02.983 --> 01:14:05.866]  It's just such a... Well, you're always doing your own little podcast.
[01:14:05.886 --> 01:14:06.746]  I think you're really smart.
[01:14:06.766 --> 01:14:08.768]  Tell me what you think.
[01:14:08.808 --> 01:14:17.174]  First of all, you're TED Talks, and I don't know... No, I think... I am shocked by the 9-0.
[01:14:17.215 --> 01:14:22.739]  I thought they were going to figure out a way to finagle something in there.
[01:14:23.219 --> 01:14:27.623]  You know, my two kids were arguing, and this is my standard for my ruling here.
[01:14:28.323 --> 01:14:31.066]  There's a referendum on the end of rule of law.
[01:14:31.366 --> 01:14:34.209]  And you know, you guys had mentioned democracy and stuff.
[01:14:34.269 --> 01:14:42.298]  This is something that is so important to them and so pure that they have to figure out a way that they can use government money to pay people to do it.
[01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:48.472]  And if it's something that you really want, that you really think is important, you don't need the money to do it.
[01:14:49.052 --> 01:14:50.833]  And we're a republic, not a democracy.
[01:14:51.253 --> 01:14:54.234]  Absolutely, but they keep their talking point.
[01:14:54.254 --> 01:14:56.214]  Democracy, so important, so important.
[01:14:56.654 --> 01:15:01.316]  But they just tried to pass laws in order to get them to where they could pay people to do democracy.
[01:15:01.796 --> 01:15:04.397]  If you had to be paid to do it, then it can't be that important.
[01:15:06.197 --> 01:15:07.118]  You're a mercenary.
[01:15:07.638 --> 01:15:08.958]  You're a mercenary, exactly.
[01:15:09.538 --> 01:15:13.719]  Plus, when you pay one group, it all goes away.
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:17.461]  Communism only works in the first few stages.
[01:15:18.261 --> 01:15:21.462]  Well, the money eventually runs out.
[01:15:21.582 --> 01:15:26.063]  My dad, when I was a kid, always told me, never speak bad of people that can give you a job.
[01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:29.482]  Those people, you know, rich people.
[01:15:29.502 --> 01:15:31.143]  These are the people that give you jobs.
[01:15:31.163 --> 01:15:32.924]  These are the people that allow you to create a life.
[01:15:33.184 --> 01:15:34.585]  Never talk bad about those people.
[01:15:35.165 --> 01:15:37.006]  And I think it's something that a lot of people forget.
[01:15:37.026 --> 01:15:42.590]  And now we've got ultra-rich at war against the wealthy and the middle class and the poor.
[01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:43.931]  They want a monopoly.
[01:15:44.651 --> 01:15:45.111]  A hundred percent.
[01:15:45.151 --> 01:15:48.333]  But it's the free market wealthy that we should appreciate.
[01:15:49.114 --> 01:15:49.634]  Absolutely.
[01:15:49.874 --> 01:15:52.296]  Because ideas and freedom always rise to the top.
[01:15:52.316 --> 01:15:53.256]  All right.
[01:15:53.516 --> 01:15:54.277]  Great job, crew.
[01:15:54.297 --> 01:15:55.458]  We'll be right back with Michael Young.
[01:15:55.478 --> 01:15:55.818]  Stay with us.

[01:16:29.054 --> 01:16:29.755]  TurboForce.

[01:16:38.602 --> 01:16:44.046]  And that is Nitric Boost to clean out your heart, your arteries, your veins, your capillaries, your cardiovascular system.
[01:16:45.026 --> 01:16:47.727]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[01:16:47.747 --> 01:16:53.030]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of, is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[01:16:53.050 --> 01:16:55.252]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[01:16:55.272 --> 01:16:56.132]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[01:16:56.172 --> 01:16:57.393]  He loved the idea.
[01:17:14.742 --> 01:17:18.267]  What would you call the debates and discussions about a pro-human future?
[01:17:18.287 --> 01:17:19.168]  Just Team Humanity?
[01:17:19.228 --> 01:17:20.109]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[01:17:20.269 --> 01:17:20.710]  Absolutely.
[01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:22.432]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[01:17:22.492 --> 01:17:25.936]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[01:17:26.156 --> 01:17:33.606]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to keep InfoWars on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[01:17:33.866 --> 01:17:45.594]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a revolution against the globalists, and it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[01:17:45.874 --> 01:17:47.195]  We're told humans are the problem.
[01:17:47.215 --> 01:17:48.215]  We're told we're killing the Earth.
[01:17:48.495 --> 01:17:52.758]  We're told all this garbage, so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[01:17:53.058 --> 01:17:53.759]  We're not going to do that.
[01:17:54.019 --> 01:17:58.642]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at infowarestore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[01:18:01.078 --> 01:18:05.803]  InfoWars is listener-supported, and we appreciate your donations.
[01:18:06.504 --> 01:18:09.447]  But buy a product, and support your health, too.
[01:18:10.688 --> 01:18:14.352]  Nitric oxide is an important chemical messenger in the body.
[01:18:14.912 --> 01:18:19.277]  It promotes blood flow, and it helps nerve cells communicate with one another.
[01:18:20.178 --> 01:18:23.061]  But over time, our bodies produce less of it.
[01:18:24.418 --> 01:18:27.603]  Full of amino acids to produce nitric oxide.
[01:18:28.084 --> 01:18:32.611]  Nitric Boost helps raise the amount of nitric oxide in your body.
[01:18:33.763 --> 01:18:40.248]  Nitric oxide is needed for strength, cardiovascular function, and healthy neurotransmission.
[01:18:41.208 --> 01:18:45.591]  It helps to improve blood flow, which helps improve overall immunity.
[01:18:46.352 --> 01:18:49.354]  Get some today, now 40% off.
[01:18:49.874 --> 01:18:54.297]  Support your health and support the InfoWar at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:19:00.239 --> 01:19:03.361]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[01:19:03.381 --> 01:19:04.922]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:19:05.683 --> 01:19:08.725]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:19:09.606 --> 01:19:17.712]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:19:18.552 --> 01:19:26.338]  And when we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:19:27.367 --> 01:19:30.210]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:19:30.230 --> 01:19:35.995]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:19:36.796 --> 01:19:39.779]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[01:19:39.819 --> 01:19:46.445]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[01:19:46.885 --> 01:19:48.067]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[01:19:48.687 --> 01:19:52.428]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsware.com.
[01:19:53.048 --> 01:19:57.689]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsware.com, our funding problems will be over.
[01:19:57.989 --> 01:19:58.869]  Please take action now.
[01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:06.411]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:18.456 --> 01:20:35.632]  Everybody knows that the dice are loaded Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed Everybody knows the war is over Everybody knows the good guy's lost
[01:20:36.813 --> 01:20:42.917]  All right, for the Balance of the Hour, we have Michael Yohn and Ann Vander Steele joining us.
[01:20:43.017 --> 01:20:44.017]  Great reporters.
[01:20:45.238 --> 01:20:45.778]  They don't hype us.
[01:20:45.818 --> 01:20:47.519]  The biggest news yet on the U.N.
[01:20:47.559 --> 01:20:56.505]  invasion camps in Mexico, also built on the Texas side by Mayorkas, and down in Panama and across the border in South America.
[01:20:56.545 --> 01:20:58.306]  They've got new videos, new reports.
[01:20:59.126 --> 01:21:01.827]  on the massive upscaling of the invasion point.
[01:21:02.267 --> 01:21:10.869]  It'll take a lot of time to get to this, but I've got to talk to Michael Yan and Ann VanderSteel first and say, 9-0 Supreme Court.
[01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:12.870]  I read part of the ruling here today.
[01:21:13.450 --> 01:21:15.110]  They said this is slavery.
[01:21:15.530 --> 01:21:18.531]  When you've not been convicted or indicted, it takes money off the ballot.
[01:21:18.931 --> 01:21:20.652]  Donald Trump is not a slave of the courts.
[01:21:20.672 --> 01:21:23.172]  He actually said the courts do not own people.
[01:21:23.473 --> 01:21:24.673]  The courts are not God.
[01:21:25.353 --> 01:21:27.175]  How did they get the Democrats to go along?
[01:21:27.195 --> 01:21:28.455]  Because it was so outrageous!
[01:21:29.236 --> 01:21:33.259]  I see this as a major turning point, so I really respect Michael Yan and Ann VanderSteel.
[01:21:33.459 --> 01:21:39.284]  I want to get your takes briefly on this, and then more importantly, how will the enemy strike back with something this big?
[01:21:39.324 --> 01:21:47.450]  Because this is a bellwether or a signal that all this lawfare that's been out of control, the total weaponization, is about to be thrown out by the Supreme Court.
[01:21:47.790 --> 01:21:49.412]  I'm worried about, and I'm serious when I say it,
[01:21:49.932 --> 01:21:52.834]  The globalist truck bombing the Supreme Court while it's in session.
[01:21:53.415 --> 01:21:54.556]  And I'm serious when I say that.
[01:21:54.576 --> 01:21:58.779]  That's the thing that pops in my head when I do the deep analysis and just focus on the info.
[01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:01.301]  They're saying they're going to stack the court.
[01:22:01.602 --> 01:22:03.243]  They're trying to intimidate and blackmail the court.
[01:22:03.263 --> 01:22:03.903]  It's not working.
[01:22:04.344 --> 01:22:10.049]  Michael Young, a former Green Beret and top wartime reporter, and Ann Vandersteel, an incredible reporter as well.
[01:22:10.109 --> 01:22:11.049]  What do you think about this?
[01:22:13.371 --> 01:22:17.074]  Well, it's pretty obvious that the lawfare has reached, you know, an extreme
[01:22:18.496 --> 01:22:22.158]  Uh, phase at this point, everything short of, you know, mass trials.
[01:22:22.558 --> 01:22:24.019]  I mean, that we're just one step.
[01:22:24.339 --> 01:22:26.520]  You've talked about these sorts of things for years, Alex.
[01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:28.461]  So, none of this is new to you at all.
[01:22:28.861 --> 01:22:32.803]  You know, of course, we're focusing on some of the physical aspects of the war as well.
[01:22:32.843 --> 01:22:43.028]  For instance, the Darien Gap and the jungle down there and the fire that just happened in one of the camps that clearly targeted immigration records, let's say invasion records.
[01:22:43.479 --> 01:22:46.821]  that are in one of the center front camps down in Panama on the Darien Gap.
[01:22:47.622 --> 01:22:50.504]  And so I think you've seen what's happened down there.
[01:22:50.864 --> 01:22:53.706]  On Friday night, there was a riot in one of the camps.
[01:22:53.766 --> 01:22:55.747]  It's one of the camps that we go to all the time.
[01:22:56.027 --> 01:22:57.208]  And we're going to talk about that.
[01:22:57.228 --> 01:22:59.830]  We're going to talk about that in a moment and show the video you sent us all of it.
[01:23:00.230 --> 01:23:01.451]  I noticed a headline this week.
[01:23:02.112 --> 01:23:07.315]  Even USA reported the Chi comms have ordered all COVID data erased.
[01:23:07.475 --> 01:23:08.516]  No mention of COVID.
[01:23:08.816 --> 01:23:11.038]  That's a communist tactic to memory whole thing.
[01:23:11.098 --> 01:23:11.238]  So
[01:23:11.958 --> 01:23:13.020]  You've sent the guys the clips.
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:13.500]  We've got them.
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:21.550]  We'll roll these while you talk, but speak big picture, million foot view on where we are right now and what you expect the deep state to do.
[01:23:21.570 --> 01:23:23.152]  I think you want to focus on the Darien Gap.
[01:23:23.172 --> 01:23:23.973]  That's very important.
[01:23:23.993 --> 01:23:24.614]  You broke that.
[01:23:25.035 --> 01:23:25.616]  It's out there.
[01:23:25.696 --> 01:23:26.176]  Great job.
[01:23:26.196 --> 01:23:30.542]  But I want your avatars on what's currently happening with the Supreme Court and Trump.
[01:23:31.701 --> 01:23:38.745]  You know, Alex, this is a time, I was listening to your previous guest, this is a moment when Americans are rising right now.
[01:23:38.946 --> 01:23:43.548]  Americans are standing up and we're saying, we've had it with this corrupt criminal cabal.
[01:23:43.568 --> 01:23:45.770]  This is not a government of, by, and for the people.
[01:23:46.330 --> 01:23:55.176]  And the public pressure that has been put on the court system, which has clearly been usurped by the globalists for some time now, has become too much.
[01:23:55.336 --> 01:23:59.939]  The deafening roar of freedom from Americans, freedoms from the usurpation of their freedoms,
[01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:03.682]  We're done with this criminal cabal.
[01:24:03.983 --> 01:24:19.879]  They saw their way to doing what was right, and they recognized that leveraging the 14th Amendment in the fashion that they were trying to do, which was just make up their own interpretation, wasn't going to stand up anymore, and Americans are becoming more educated about what's really
[01:24:20.339 --> 01:24:38.195]  Fact when it comes to the Constitution, the body politic, the body sovereign, and the law of the land that we stand on and what separates us and the Constitutional Republic, which is that Constitution, a trust document from the legislative democracy of Washington, D.C., which is governed by administrative law, rules, codes, statutes, and ordinances.
[01:24:38.615 --> 01:24:39.756]  Donald Trump's a living man.
[01:24:40.557 --> 01:24:41.277]  He's not there.
[01:24:41.457 --> 01:24:42.438]  And so he's not them.
[01:24:42.498 --> 01:24:44.020]  And the problem is they were trying to apply
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:47.942]  Their process is on to a free man and you can't do that.
[01:24:48.343 --> 01:24:54.987]  He is allowed to be elected or allowed to be put on the ballot and the Colorado Supreme Court was literally making stuff up, Alex.
[01:24:55.007 --> 01:24:59.550]  They were completely twisting the words of our Constitution in order to try and fit a square peg in a round hole.
[01:24:59.870 --> 01:25:06.935]  And the people saw through it and the campaign that we have waged and we told our public servants, in fact, to do their job.
[01:25:07.095 --> 01:25:10.798]  And we're seeing that happen around the country right now and it's very exciting.
[01:25:11.138 --> 01:25:15.100]  The other oppressor out there that we can't let go ignore is the United Nations.
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:29.628]  The public, the pressure that they've been putting on with their unofficial State Department at the World Economic Forum, two organizations you know very well and have lamented on for years in fact about, have been trying to promote their ideology into our Constitution.
[01:25:30.288 --> 01:25:30.688]  You're right.
[01:25:30.708 --> 01:25:33.750]  I mean, six years ago, Lou Dobbs talked about the Darien Gap and the U.N.
[01:25:33.790 --> 01:25:35.190]  camps and the U.N.
[01:25:35.210 --> 01:25:37.371]  debit cards from George Soros and the State Department.
[01:25:37.391 --> 01:25:38.892]  He got fired from Fox Business.
[01:25:39.232 --> 01:25:40.772]  So it's important to focus on this.
[01:25:41.033 --> 01:25:42.033]  We're going to get to that in a moment.
[01:25:42.053 --> 01:25:43.214]  Thanks for your take, Anne.
[01:25:43.374 --> 01:25:43.994]  Excellent points.
[01:25:45.134 --> 01:25:48.016]  Michael Young, your take on the American battle space.
[01:25:48.036 --> 01:25:50.917]  I know you're focusing on the invasion, the gates being blown open.
[01:25:51.157 --> 01:25:52.738]  We'll get to that coming up next segment.
[01:25:52.758 --> 01:25:57.640]  But your view as a really smart guy on where we are right now, because we're having this big Supreme Court victory.
[01:25:57.700 --> 01:25:58.460]  Why do you think that happened?
[01:26:00.362 --> 01:26:02.003]  Well, we've already crossed the Rubicon.
[01:26:02.043 --> 01:26:05.145]  There's no, you know, there's no way out of this that's pretty.
[01:26:05.405 --> 01:26:08.867]  I mean, it would be like turning around a freighter ship in the Panama Canal.
[01:26:08.968 --> 01:26:09.508]  It's just not.
[01:26:09.988 --> 01:26:10.348]  It's there.
[01:26:11.009 --> 01:26:12.550]  And the bottom line is we have.
[01:26:13.286 --> 01:26:22.615]  At least tens of millions of aliens in the United States, most of whom are military-age males, and most of whom, you won't believe the things that we're seeing down there.
[01:26:23.375 --> 01:26:25.317]  A lot of these people are clear operative types.
[01:26:25.637 --> 01:26:28.099]  Look what just happened in San Vicente camp on Friday night.
[01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:29.561]  The big fire, right?
[01:26:30.001 --> 01:26:32.423]  And it specifically targeted the records.
[01:26:33.404 --> 01:26:34.565]  So start getting into that.
[01:26:34.645 --> 01:26:37.128]  Start over, tell us about the fire, we'll show the footage you got.
[01:26:37.648 --> 01:26:39.590]  Key records building towards what's happening.
[01:26:41.550 --> 01:26:43.972]  Well, the key record, you know, we were just at that building.
[01:26:44.012 --> 01:26:45.613]  We were just out there, what, two weeks ago.
[01:26:46.393 --> 01:26:50.917]  Ann VanderSteel and I were standing right there with Masako Kanaha and Laura Loomer.
[01:26:51.277 --> 01:26:55.780]  Laura interviewed that Somali guy right in front of the building that just caught on fire, right?
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:57.842]  We were like eight feet away, right?
[01:26:58.262 --> 01:27:02.165]  And you'll see the building in the background with Laura's interview with the Somali.
[01:27:02.425 --> 01:27:03.706]  There was an Iranian guy there.
[01:27:03.906 --> 01:27:06.788]  They all talked very suspicious.
[01:27:07.615 --> 01:27:11.981]  Who is this Iranian guy with the perfect English and the perfect teeth, bodybuilder guy, right?
[01:27:12.402 --> 01:27:14.104]  Looked like he had not been through the jungle.
[01:27:14.705 --> 01:27:16.868]  There was a Chinese guy in a similar position.
[01:27:17.248 --> 01:27:22.055]  Now there are a lot of people who might want to destroy those records or steal those records.
[01:27:22.915 --> 01:27:25.897]  And my guesstimate is somebody actually stole the records.
[01:27:25.937 --> 01:27:27.278]  I'm very familiar with that camp.
[01:27:27.599 --> 01:27:29.920]  I'm very familiar with the surroundings of that camp.
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:32.662]  That's the camp that Mayorkas went to on April 18, 2022.
[01:27:33.783 --> 01:27:35.944]  I was physically present when he went.
[01:27:36.305 --> 01:27:40.868]  HIAS is about 40 yards away from the front gate of that camp.
[01:27:41.168 --> 01:27:44.430]  So HIAS is about 50 yards away from the fires, right?
[01:27:45.191 --> 01:27:49.834]  And HIAS, for those who don't know, is the International Jewish Migrant Group.
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:58.265]  Right, of which Mayorkas, Ali Mayorkas, the Department of Homeland Security Chief, was a board member on HIAS, right?
[01:27:58.625 --> 01:28:04.429]  He's actually a migrant from Cuba, both of his parents were Jewish, and he was a board member on HIAS.
[01:28:04.489 --> 01:28:11.653]  If you go to HIAS.org, you will see them congratulating Mayorkas as he moves over to the Department of Homeland Security.
[01:28:11.974 --> 01:28:20.119]  Now these, you know, the UN organizations and other NGOs are quickly taking over places like Panama.
[01:28:20.799 --> 01:28:22.621]  The Panamanian government sees it now.
[01:28:22.981 --> 01:28:26.443]  They see very clearly that these organizations are working hard.
[01:28:26.463 --> 01:28:27.564]  They're doing the same in Thailand.
[01:28:27.924 --> 01:28:29.225]  I'm watching Thailand as well.
[01:28:29.245 --> 01:28:30.546]  They're doing the same in Japan.
[01:28:30.866 --> 01:28:32.087]  I'm watching Japan closely.
[01:28:32.127 --> 01:28:33.808]  I'll be there again next week in Japan.
[01:28:34.549 --> 01:28:35.930]  I saw the headlines last year.
[01:28:36.010 --> 01:28:37.771]  Japan for the first time opens its borders.
[01:28:37.831 --> 01:28:38.611]  What's going on?
[01:28:39.172 --> 01:28:46.497]  All right, Ann VanderSteel and Michael Young, our guests to give us, this is just the first of like seven different big breaking stories they've got.
[01:28:46.957 --> 01:28:48.398]  Straight ahead, but boom!
[01:28:48.858 --> 01:28:54.763]  Supreme Court unanimously says Soros Lawfare, total fraud, trying to steal the election.
[01:28:55.023 --> 01:28:56.264]  Trump, back on the ballot.

[01:33:28.342 --> 01:33:31.203]  Well, the demon rats have introduced legislation.
[01:33:31.243 --> 01:33:36.305]  We've got the clip coming up after our guests leave us to pull Trump off the ballot with a congressional vote.
[01:33:37.425 --> 01:33:42.007]  And they've said even if he wins, they're not going to accept it, which they've indicted him for doing, which he didn't do.
[01:33:42.447 --> 01:33:43.628]  He wanted an investigation.
[01:33:45.049 --> 01:33:47.470]  Wow, so much at InfoWars.com.
[01:33:48.610 --> 01:33:52.032]  So if you can't wait to hear it when I cover it, go to InfoWars.com right now.

[01:33:57.614 --> 01:33:58.914]  They're back in the United States now.
[01:33:58.934 --> 01:34:02.256]  I'm told at the Brighteon Studios there in Tennessee.
[01:34:02.316 --> 01:34:05.257]  I'm glad to hear Brighteon's expanding, not just here in Texas.
[01:34:06.717 --> 01:34:14.022]  So, you sent me a whole list of big developments, and you guys have put Darien Gap on the map, and now Congress is covering it, the giant U.N.
[01:34:14.082 --> 01:34:14.883]  camps they're building.
[01:34:15.803 --> 01:34:17.104]  What are the other big developments?
[01:34:17.164 --> 01:34:21.567]  You were telling me these are the biggest developments yet that we're looking at right now, Mike Leon and Ann Vander Stil.
[01:34:23.008 --> 01:34:24.148]  You know, these are so big.
[01:34:24.489 --> 01:34:26.370]  You know, I went on the Tucker Show the other day.
[01:34:27.702 --> 01:34:29.523]  Thanks in part to your recommendation.
[01:34:31.044 --> 01:34:38.068]  Tucker had only scheduled 10 or 15 minutes for me, but we went on for as long as he could, and then he wants to do another three to four hours.
[01:34:38.368 --> 01:34:39.969]  He sees how important dairying is.
[01:34:40.069 --> 01:34:40.890]  Thanks to you, sir.
[01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:44.632]  And thanks to others who recommended to Tucker to do this.
[01:34:45.032 --> 01:34:49.956]  So, a lot of people are seeing how serious this invasion through the Darien is now, right?
[01:34:50.256 --> 01:34:52.658]  This is absolutely existential to the United States.
[01:34:52.998 --> 01:34:54.219]  That's the main invasion route.
[01:34:54.459 --> 01:34:59.904]  There's something else going on down there that you and I have talked about on your show a few times, and that is that they're making a
[01:35:00.924 --> 01:35:02.364]  A crossing to Columbia.
[01:35:02.384 --> 01:35:03.525]  They're building a bridge.
[01:35:03.565 --> 01:35:04.645]  We were just down there again.
[01:35:04.665 --> 01:35:06.645]  They're going to build a road straight to Columbia.
[01:35:06.905 --> 01:35:09.486]  Now, this is very important to the United States for various reasons.
[01:35:09.886 --> 01:35:11.146]  One is hoof and mouth disease.
[01:35:11.486 --> 01:35:20.548]  One of the reasons we've never had the road to South America is the United States did not want this because we didn't want these diseases up into the United States.
[01:35:20.928 --> 01:35:27.670]  You might recall even a year or so ago, I was talking on your show about the potential of screw worms getting into the United States.
[01:35:28.110 --> 01:35:32.273]  Screwworms are flesh-eating worms that really rip into cattle and humans, too.
[01:35:32.313 --> 01:35:35.815]  They've killed humans in Texas and other parts of the United States.
[01:35:35.835 --> 01:35:49.062]  Yeah, for folks who don't know, my dad, one of his earliest memories is in the 50s, the total war in East Texas, with the federal government involved with these really toxic poisons he believes killed his dad decades later, cyanide powder, to kill the screwworms.
[01:35:49.102 --> 01:35:51.324]  They don't eat dead meat, they eat live flesh.
[01:35:53.539 --> 01:35:55.521]  Yeah, you're one of the few people that even know that.
[01:35:55.582 --> 01:36:09.858]  You know, Dr. Michael Vickers, whom we've talked about numerous times on your show, Dr. Michael Vickers told me last week on the phone that the Department of Agriculture now in Texas is getting daily briefings on the march back to the United States from the screw worms.
[01:36:10.259 --> 01:36:11.000]  Now, as you know,
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:19.705]  Our parents' generation and grandparents, especially grandparents, bought the screw worms out of the United States, bought them down through Mexico.
[01:36:19.725 --> 01:36:20.866]  It was a literal war.
[01:36:21.246 --> 01:36:26.069]  Bought them down into, and basically the front line of the war is now the Darien Gap.
[01:36:26.429 --> 01:36:32.313]  So, our Department of Agriculture irradiates billions of flies and drops those over the Darien Gap.
[01:36:32.333 --> 01:36:34.214]  They used to do that in Texas, right?
[01:36:34.734 --> 01:36:35.114]  And now,
[01:36:36.710 --> 01:36:41.555]  You know, so I've been warning for a couple of years, I thought these screwworms were going to make it back to the United States.
[01:36:41.935 --> 01:36:47.762]  So I contacted this screwworm facility down in Panama, and they were very cagey.
[01:36:47.842 --> 01:36:50.484]  It's an American Department of Agriculture facility.
[01:36:50.765 --> 01:36:51.966]  They were very, very cagey.
[01:36:52.006 --> 01:36:52.867]  They didn't want to talk.
[01:36:53.207 --> 01:36:54.789]  And now we see the screwworms.
[01:36:55.209 --> 01:37:04.494]  You know, there's reports that they're up and they're actually the United States Department of Agriculture is now working to reopen a facility in Costa Rica to fight these things back.
[01:37:04.934 --> 01:37:05.815]  Something is wrong.
[01:37:05.895 --> 01:37:07.916]  We know our food supply is under attack.
[01:37:08.236 --> 01:37:15.960]  And that's why I wanted to talk with them a couple of years ago because I thought, well, they're the government and they're going to screw us the way with the screw worms.
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:33.696]  So anyway, the bottom line is we have a lot of things going on in Panama, besides the Panama Canal, which in and of itself is obviously incredibly important to the United States, and the Darien Gap, and just the location of Panama, where you can affect, you know, South America, Central America, and obviously the United States.
[01:37:33.716 --> 01:37:34.797]  That's airstrike distance.
[01:37:35.137 --> 01:37:43.260]  From the United States and now there's the biological issue as well, which has been there for generations and we've known about for actually in Spanish.
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:46.061]  They call it the tampon day.
[01:37:46.101 --> 01:37:49.023]  Which means the tampon of Darien the plug of Darien.
[01:37:49.363 --> 01:37:56.065]  They call it the plug because we're trying to keep everything plugged down in South America that we don't want into Panama and into the United States.
[01:37:56.406 --> 01:37:58.166]  But right now that plug is being open.
[01:37:58.426 --> 01:37:59.287]  They're building a road.
[01:37:59.327 --> 01:38:02.408]  We were just down there looking at it again a couple weeks ago.
[01:38:03.464 --> 01:38:08.226]  And just the Texas story, because my dad, the doctors thought that's what killed my grandfather.
[01:38:08.246 --> 01:38:12.387]  An amazing guy, Jerry Jones, who's like 52 years old, was in the screw worm battle.
[01:38:12.467 --> 01:38:16.949]  The federal government shipped in tractor trailers for the ranchers of cyanide powder.
[01:38:17.949 --> 01:38:20.210]  And you were supposed to wear gloves and masks, which still got everywhere.
[01:38:20.650 --> 01:38:22.471]  They would put it all to the cows to kill the screw worms.
[01:38:22.511 --> 01:38:27.653]  So the federal government had to use cyanide in Texas and in Mexico to stop these things.
[01:38:28.113 --> 01:38:29.674]  And now they're just being brought right back in.
[01:38:31.127 --> 01:38:31.968]  They kill people, too.
[01:38:32.009 --> 01:38:34.853]  They get in your nose and kill children and whatnot.
[01:38:35.094 --> 01:38:38.760]  Yeah, these things, they're flesh-eating worms, and they don't, you know... Describe it.
[01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:42.065]  They go into your sinus, lay eggs, and then maggots eat your brain.
[01:38:43.728 --> 01:38:44.169]  That's right.
[01:38:44.656 --> 01:38:45.157]  It's terrible.
[01:38:45.457 --> 01:38:46.218]  That's exactly right.
[01:38:46.238 --> 01:38:49.181]  And Alex, they have no intention of slowing this down whatsoever.
[01:38:49.221 --> 01:38:56.549]  That bridge that we uncovered and exposed that connects the South American continent to the North American continent is going to expedite all of this.
[01:38:56.629 --> 01:39:07.300]  In fact, these Ambara Indians that we've been reporting on that are using their riverboat canoes to basically be taxi cabs on the water for hundreds of thousands of migrants.
[01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:08.201]  We're good to go.
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:37.722]  And, you know, moreover, all of that, we have to now look at what's actually happening on another global scale, the banking side, right, Alex?
[01:39:37.782 --> 01:39:41.563]  The Federal Reserve on March 11th is going to say, OK, folks, it's time.
[01:39:41.943 --> 01:39:43.283]  No more money is going out.
[01:39:43.303 --> 01:39:48.004]  And we know that last November, Jamie Dimon, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and J.P.
[01:39:48.044 --> 01:39:49.224]  Morgan all said, guess what?
[01:39:49.284 --> 01:39:50.965]  We can't go from zero percent.
[01:39:51.525 --> 01:39:52.385]  Reserves to 3%.
[01:39:52.766 --> 01:39:53.506]  We can't increase 3%.
[01:39:54.126 --> 01:39:54.966]  We don't have the money.
[01:39:55.387 --> 01:40:08.451]  So when they cut off the spigot, the Fed is now picking winners and losers and you're going to have a whole bunch of migrants, invaders that are in the country right now with their debit cards at $2,200 a month and north of there that will be cut off as well.
[01:40:08.831 --> 01:40:14.674]  What do you think is going to happen when the Customs and Border Protection openly admits to 47 million illegals in this country since 2021?
[01:40:16.014 --> 01:40:21.436]  All on some kind of debit EBT card dependent on the government, and it gets cut off because there's no more money.
[01:40:21.896 --> 01:40:25.257]  Who's going to start riding besides the fact that we're also going to get cut off?
[01:40:25.557 --> 01:40:29.378]  It is going to become, that's a recipe for complete melee here in the country Alex.
[01:40:29.398 --> 01:40:31.179]  So that's the most important clip.
[01:40:31.219 --> 01:40:34.540]  I want you to elaborate Michael, but that's the most important clip.
[01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:39.562]  When I put this up to Bandot Video and on X-Later, I'm going to put your clip in up front because
[01:40:40.282 --> 01:40:42.943]  They're already giving illegal aliens preferential treatment to get them here.
[01:40:42.983 --> 01:40:44.904]  They're already cut the veterans and the citizens off.
[01:40:45.364 --> 01:40:47.285]  And you're right, they're saying they're about to cut the illegals off.
[01:40:48.506 --> 01:40:50.367]  20 million is conservative, probably 40 plus million.
[01:40:50.907 --> 01:40:53.188]  As you said, not the 10 million that Rand Paul talks about.
[01:40:53.228 --> 01:40:54.449]  Nothing against him, which is not true.
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:56.761]  Those are CPB numbers.
[01:40:57.202 --> 01:40:58.743]  I posted that from CPB.
[01:40:58.763 --> 01:41:00.165]  They have their own numbers.
[01:41:00.185 --> 01:41:01.146]  47 million since 2021.
[01:41:01.366 --> 01:41:11.316]  So let's elaborate on that, and Michael, but you talk about an angrier world, talk about the numbers, then talk about what happens when they cut those debit cards off, when they cut those welfare checks.
[01:41:12.335 --> 01:41:14.137]  Let's talk about real humanitarians.
[01:41:14.157 --> 01:41:17.982]  You know, there's vegetarians and pescatarians and fruitarians.
[01:41:18.322 --> 01:41:23.188]  And then when people get hungry, they become humanitarians, right?
[01:41:23.228 --> 01:41:24.110]  Straight up cannibals.
[01:41:24.170 --> 01:41:28.795]  I mean, you know, the bottom line is that when people are hungry, they go straight to cannibalism.
[01:41:28.875 --> 01:41:30.738]  A lot of them within even a week, right?
[01:41:31.118 --> 01:41:32.078]  That's what we're looking at.
[01:41:32.258 --> 01:41:35.239]  This is straight up, you know, you talk about this all the time, Alex.
[01:41:35.699 --> 01:41:37.200]  You know, it's coming.
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:38.120]  It's coming.
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:45.822]  You look at Europe right now talking about, you know, sending over excess money from Europe to Ukraine.
[01:41:46.122 --> 01:41:48.243]  I mean, this is all the great taking, right?
[01:41:48.563 --> 01:41:51.484]  This is an oligarch versus oligarch.
[01:41:51.524 --> 01:41:53.284]  You've talked about this for many years.
[01:41:53.624 --> 01:41:55.565]  Nobody needs to brief Alex Jones.
[01:41:56.305 --> 01:41:57.006]  On any of this.
[01:41:57.026 --> 01:42:01.429]  If anything, I mean, the bottom line is we're going into a war.
[01:42:01.469 --> 01:42:03.810]  We're actually in the front stages of the war now.
[01:42:04.170 --> 01:42:07.813]  It has not become highly kinetic yet, but that day is clearly coming.
[01:42:10.714 --> 01:42:11.475]  Elaborate on that.
[01:42:13.206 --> 01:42:19.652]  Well, the bottom line is we have been infused with tens of millions of military-age males from all over the world.
[01:42:20.252 --> 01:42:21.413]  There's different ecosystems.
[01:42:21.433 --> 01:42:30.341]  We have the Chinese, as an example, who are going up, they're doing their illegal marijuana farms up in Maine and Oregon and Oklahoma and everywhere else.
[01:42:30.781 --> 01:42:36.967]  And we've got major bloggers, you know, basically pushing Americans to smoke the dope and whatnot.
[01:42:37.247 --> 01:42:40.790]  We've got fentanyl coming across, killing thousands of Americans per month.
[01:42:41.070 --> 01:42:57.309]  They're making money off destroying our military age males, while their military age males come through places like the Darien Gap, filled with testosterone, ready to fight, filled with piss and vinegar, and actually, we've been told that a lot of the Chinese, they've already picked out which homes they're gonna live in.
[01:42:57.649 --> 01:42:58.030]  Stay there!
[01:42:59.246 --> 01:43:01.788]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalists.
[01:43:02.168 --> 01:43:04.530]  And people can't identify who's a patriot and who isn't.
[01:43:04.830 --> 01:43:07.993]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalists.
[01:43:08.033 --> 01:43:10.955]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.
[01:43:11.195 --> 01:43:21.783]  That's why I designed this amazing 1776 red, white, and blue Gadsden flag shirt so you can support the end of the war and meet like-minded people everywhere when you wear it.

[01:45:33.540 --> 01:45:37.945]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[01:45:38.365 --> 01:45:42.070]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the Passionflower.
[01:45:42.310 --> 01:45:44.012]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[01:45:44.032 --> 01:45:44.332]  Thank you.
[01:46:01.710 --> 01:46:04.293]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[01:46:04.353 --> 01:46:05.615]  I started taking that stuff.
[01:46:05.655 --> 01:46:08.839]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[01:46:08.959 --> 01:46:09.880]  When did you start taking that?
[01:46:10.141 --> 01:46:14.086]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[01:46:14.767 --> 01:46:17.470]  And I started eating a little better, but my blood pressure stayed high.
[01:46:17.490 --> 01:46:20.294]  And when I took X2 iodine, after about two or four weeks,
[01:46:20.814 --> 01:46:24.977]  I think my body's detoxified of a bunch of metals and stuff that my body was storing.
[01:46:25.097 --> 01:46:27.298]  And my blood pressure came down to perfect level.
[01:46:27.679 --> 01:46:30.701]  And I tell people the only thing I did was X2 Iodine.
[01:46:31.081 --> 01:46:44.970]  And even though I do think all your other products are good, I recommend to anybody that they start with X2 Iodine because it detoxifies your body and kind of kicks your natural DNA into full force.
[01:46:45.050 --> 01:46:48.513]  So, in my life, I found X2 Iodine to be best.
[01:46:48.993 --> 01:46:50.374]  I tried other iodines and
[01:46:51.194 --> 01:46:52.576]  They didn't have the same effect.
[01:46:52.616 --> 01:46:55.018]  So X, Y, and Z. I really wanted to point that out.
[01:47:15.691 --> 01:47:25.342]  Alright, we have the frothing, insane response of the Democrat Deep State against the Supreme Court ruling for Donald Trump 9-0 that the Colorado case and others are complete total frauds.
[01:47:26.323 --> 01:47:26.963]  That's coming up.
[01:47:26.983 --> 01:47:30.007]  We have another special guest popping in, but...
[01:47:31.274 --> 01:47:38.356]  Michael Yon, investigative journalist, has spent the last few years, probably, I don't know, six months or more, the Darien Gap down there, exposing the U.N.
[01:47:38.396 --> 01:47:40.376]  camps, now that one of the biggest stories out there.
[01:47:41.057 --> 01:47:42.377]  And Ann Vander Still down there with you.
[01:47:42.397 --> 01:47:44.557]  You were talking about the chi-coms.
[01:47:44.617 --> 01:47:51.919]  You interview them, you talk to them, you got Iranians, ah, we're taking over America, ah, you know, all these military-age men with the same shoes, same backpacks, marching through.
[01:47:51.939 --> 01:47:53.920]  I mean, this is so organized.
[01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:57.961]  You got caught up on the break, Michael Yon, talking about
[01:47:58.991 --> 01:48:03.932]  How the Chi-Coms are even talking about what houses they're going to get in America.
[01:48:04.352 --> 01:48:06.133]  Elaborate on that and start over.
[01:48:08.413 --> 01:48:09.914]  Well, they've got their own ecosystem.
[01:48:09.974 --> 01:48:16.415]  The Chinese, they're not coming in helter-skelter like many of the Venezuelans are coming in mostly helter-skelter.
[01:48:16.735 --> 01:48:20.796]  But keep in mind, even within Venezuelans, there's different ecosystems.
[01:48:21.156 --> 01:48:27.698]  You've got Iranians coming through with Venezuelan passports because Iranians can fly to Venezuela and get new passports on arrival.
[01:48:28.438 --> 01:48:32.620]  You've got Hezbollah that have grown up in Venezuela who speak Spanish fluently.
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:34.340]  They've got their own ecosystems.
[01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:39.923]  But the Chinese Communist Party is working very diligently to take over the United States.
[01:48:40.423 --> 01:48:42.023]  Not just the United States, but the world.
[01:48:42.424 --> 01:48:51.107]  You know, this is the first time in human history where somebody could actually, probably with a long-term goal, a strategy, actually kind of pull it off.
[01:48:51.567 --> 01:48:54.768]  And, you know, I've seen this when I've been up in Tibet and Hong Kong.
[01:48:55.088 --> 01:48:56.529]  You'll see what they do is they just
[01:48:57.242 --> 01:49:05.386]  Drip, drop, drip, drop, demographic warfare, slowly bring in enough people, fill up the bathtub until they've got the critical mass of people.
[01:49:05.426 --> 01:49:09.067]  Of course, they don't just come in... And it's only open societies that allow them to do that.
[01:49:09.087 --> 01:49:09.967]  They use that against us.
[01:49:10.007 --> 01:49:10.548]  So elaborate.
[01:49:10.828 --> 01:49:13.329]  They're specifically saying they're looking at what houses they're going to get.
[01:49:14.898 --> 01:49:15.559]  Yeah, actually.
[01:49:15.619 --> 01:49:18.762]  I mean, we've been told that they're looking at which properties they're just going to take.
[01:49:19.042 --> 01:49:21.685]  They're using satellite imagery, Alex.
[01:49:22.105 --> 01:49:30.353]  Google Earth Satellite is a great resource for everybody, and the Chinese Communist Party has used that and mapped out, my house goes to this one, your house goes to that one.
[01:49:30.553 --> 01:49:34.737]  So they're already mapping out what they're going to do during the collapse.
[01:49:34.958 --> 01:49:38.321]  We know the left's using a malice blueprint they admit to take over.
[01:49:39.775 --> 01:49:41.135]  Yeah, and they'll stick together, of course.
[01:49:41.215 --> 01:49:48.257]  It's not going to be, you know, some outlier Chinese out in the middle of nowhere or the middle of a separate demographic.
[01:49:48.637 --> 01:49:51.378]  They will consolidate their resources and powers.
[01:49:51.698 --> 01:49:55.059]  You know, these marijuana farms that they have up in Maine, you can look on the news.
[01:49:55.119 --> 01:49:55.779]  I mean, it's big.
[01:49:56.099 --> 01:49:58.800]  They've been seizing huge amounts.
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:49:59.760]  The U.S.
[01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:03.281]  government has been seizing huge amounts of marijuana from some of these grows.
[01:50:03.661 --> 01:50:09.043]  But as you know, they can instantly turn these marijuana grows into food as well.
[01:50:09.343 --> 01:50:15.086]  So when the crisis occurs, the huge crisis occurs, you know, they plan to mostly weather the storm.
[01:50:15.306 --> 01:50:19.808]  And we've got Bill Gates buying up and now all the billionaires are dumping everything going into food.
[01:50:19.868 --> 01:50:20.348]  Why is that?
[01:50:22.426 --> 01:50:30.649]  Yeah, I mean over in Netherlands, Misako Kanaha and I, we went to a restaurant in Netherlands where they're actually selling printed steaks.
[01:50:30.990 --> 01:50:32.770]  I mean like, sort of like a jet printer.
[01:50:32.810 --> 01:50:34.791]  We bought some, we didn't eat them, we didn't even taste them.
[01:50:35.131 --> 01:50:39.653]  But we went over there and we live, we ordered these printed steaks like inkjet.
[01:50:39.853 --> 01:50:41.114]  Look at it on YouTube, you know.
[01:50:41.134 --> 01:50:43.815]  Yeah, what they are is literally rotting bacteria.
[01:50:45.330 --> 01:50:46.131]  It's nasty.
[01:50:46.231 --> 01:50:49.814]  I mean, you know, but actually, if you didn't know the difference, it would look like a real steak.
[01:50:49.834 --> 01:50:52.235]  You know, it's nasty because we know what it is.
[01:50:52.556 --> 01:51:04.125]  But, you know, they're doing the same over in Netherlands, for instance, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation investing hundreds of millions of dollars into the picnic distribution centers, three of which actually burned down when we were there.
[01:51:04.485 --> 01:51:05.766]  We went to one, actually.
[01:51:06.266 --> 01:51:07.347]  It had already burned down.
[01:51:07.387 --> 01:51:08.788]  It was still smoldering.
[01:51:09.269 --> 01:51:10.309]  That's another question.
[01:51:10.329 --> 01:51:12.871]  We know there's record burning of food production facilities.
[01:51:12.891 --> 01:51:13.472]  What's behind that?
[01:51:15.652 --> 01:51:16.313]  Coincidence?
[01:51:16.794 --> 01:51:17.195]  Maybe.
[01:51:17.215 --> 01:51:22.365]  I mean, it could be coincidence like those records that just burned last Friday night down in the Darien Gap.
[01:51:22.765 --> 01:51:25.250]  Sure are a lot of coincidences going on, right?
[01:51:25.390 --> 01:51:25.611]  I mean...
[01:51:26.548 --> 01:51:27.209]  Alex, you know what?
[01:51:27.710 --> 01:51:31.374]  Dr. Richard Bartlett, who lives in Texas, was down driving in El Paso the other day.
[01:51:31.394 --> 01:51:39.283]  He called to tell me that Customs and Border Protection stopped his car, and they were stopping all the cars down on the highway in El Paso along the border.
[01:51:39.303 --> 01:51:43.628]  But he asked the police officer at the Customs and Border Agents, you know, are you an American?
[01:51:43.648 --> 01:51:45.491]  And Dr. Bartlett said, yes, I am.
[01:51:46.031 --> 01:51:49.794]  The border agent didn't ask for a passport, driver's license, any kind of identification.
[01:51:50.114 --> 01:51:52.156]  He sort of looked in the car and said, OK, fine, go on.
[01:51:52.176 --> 01:51:56.680]  And before he left, Dr. Bartlett said, well, why aren't you stopping all of these 18-wheelers that are flying by?
[01:51:57.160 --> 01:51:59.422]  CBP said, we don't have the resources.
[01:51:59.862 --> 01:52:07.768]  So meanwhile, we know, the reporting I've done on Fast and Furious and what we see happening at the border, there's all kinds of contraband coming in, these 18-wheelers.
[01:52:07.808 --> 01:52:11.471]  How many stories have we read about illegals that are burned up and suffocated in these 18-wheelers?
[01:52:11.511 --> 01:52:12.632]  But what else can they be carrying?
[01:52:12.712 --> 01:52:14.974]  NBC, nuclear, biological, chemical weapons.
[01:52:15.414 --> 01:52:16.895]  Weapons caches, uniforms.
[01:52:17.255 --> 01:52:22.137]  And we have the FBI Director saying they've never seen such a threat, so they're getting us ready for it.
[01:52:22.157 --> 01:52:27.819]  So they allow it to happen, the Justice Department doesn't let the judges... Right?
[01:52:28.159 --> 01:52:31.181]  Hegelian dialect, let it happen and then we'll come in with a solution.
[01:52:31.261 --> 01:52:38.704]  And General Flynn talking about seven divisions of the Chinese Army already in this country, and we've seen the amount of Chinese down at the border ourselves.
[01:52:39.784 --> 01:52:41.085]  It's clearly they're setting us up.
[01:52:41.105 --> 01:52:43.366]  It's hard to believe, but it's actually happening.
[01:52:44.878 --> 01:52:45.338]  That's right.
[01:52:45.659 --> 01:52:47.421]  Hard to believe, but it's actually happening.
[01:52:47.461 --> 01:52:53.707]  And you know, this is why Michael Yan has been telling people, you know, pandemic, he saw it in January of 2020 when it was coming.
[01:52:54.067 --> 01:52:58.832]  And we've been, you know, he's been sounding the alarm and many of us like yourself have been sounding the alarm for a long time.
[01:52:59.298 --> 01:53:05.383]  Be prepared with food, you know, food, food, food, because they are destroying our food supply.
[01:53:05.424 --> 01:53:09.747]  If it's not burning down, it's wildfires that are killing feedlots.
[01:53:09.787 --> 01:53:17.334]  If it's not that, it's screwworm or other zoonotic diseases like multidrug-resistant tuberculosis that also slaughters humans and cattle.
[01:53:17.354 --> 01:53:19.997]  And they hit us with the poison shots, 20-plus million dead.
[01:53:20.057 --> 01:53:20.857]  This is the war.
[01:53:21.938 --> 01:53:23.961]  Michael said at the start of the interview, we're in the start of it.
[01:53:24.282 --> 01:53:24.502]  I agree.
[01:53:24.522 --> 01:53:26.845]  We're at the beginning of the end of the first phase.
[01:53:27.426 --> 01:53:29.288]  We're at the beginning of the end of the first phase.
[01:53:29.328 --> 01:53:31.151]  We're going into the second phase, Michael, I believe.
[01:53:32.782 --> 01:53:33.783]  Yeah, it's very clear.
[01:53:33.823 --> 01:53:39.588]  It's going to get very deadly and, you know, and very quickly as the food... Eventually, something will happen.
[01:53:39.608 --> 01:53:44.072]  I think we can all smell that, whether it's power outages and communications stop.
[01:53:44.112 --> 01:53:47.876]  You know, if we have serious power outages, everybody knows where that goes.
[01:53:47.896 --> 01:53:49.097]  That goes directly to famine.
[01:53:49.497 --> 01:53:52.280]  And famine goes straight to true humanitarianism.
[01:53:52.588 --> 01:53:53.809]  You know, cannibalism, right?
[01:53:54.069 --> 01:53:57.532]  I mean, straight up destruction of the United States as we know it.
[01:53:57.572 --> 01:53:58.333]  The same with Europe.
[01:53:58.653 --> 01:54:00.955]  You know, I've spent more than six years running around Europe.
[01:54:01.455 --> 01:54:06.199]  You know, this idea that Europe is some big civilized place and more civilized than the United States.
[01:54:06.259 --> 01:54:07.860]  Basically, it's the white people in the Middle East.
[01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:09.802]  I spent six years all over Europe.
[01:54:09.822 --> 01:54:13.665]  You know, I'm not impressed with their ability to keep the peace there.
[01:54:13.725 --> 01:54:14.586]  They will not do it.
[01:54:14.646 --> 01:54:20.110]  Look, last time I was in the UK, last year, you know, London is, it is London-stan now, right?
[01:54:20.518 --> 01:54:21.999]  And Ireland's the same.
[01:54:22.059 --> 01:54:23.801]  I went to Ireland last year.
[01:54:23.821 --> 01:54:24.781]  I was in Dublin.
[01:54:24.821 --> 01:54:25.802]  I was up in Belfast.
[01:54:26.062 --> 01:54:28.264]  You know, there's more than 20 miles of walls.
[01:54:28.744 --> 01:54:31.046]  That's more impressive than Trump Wall, by the way.
[01:54:31.326 --> 01:54:32.688]  And the Trump Wall's pretty impressive.
[01:54:33.028 --> 01:54:41.274]  But it's more impressive even than that, up in Belfast, Ireland, to keep Irish, white people Irish, away from white people Irish.
[01:54:41.394 --> 01:54:43.516]  Because, you know, Catholics versus Protestants.
[01:54:43.876 --> 01:54:45.417]  Meanwhile, they're flooding the place with
[01:54:46.478 --> 01:54:55.065]  Afghans and Somalis and Nigerians and who's who in the zoo and now Ireland is starting to have very serious problems.
[01:54:55.505 --> 01:54:57.266]  This has been a long time coming.
[01:54:58.007 --> 01:55:00.248]  The fact that you even named your show Info Wars.
[01:55:04.051 --> 01:55:07.332]  The highest form of warfare is information warfare.
[01:55:07.612 --> 01:55:09.312]  I mean, you saw it a long time ago.
[01:55:09.652 --> 01:55:16.494]  That's what destroyed our borders with the Declaration of North America and so many other things that Anne and you have talked about.
[01:55:16.514 --> 01:55:17.434]  And now we're living in it.
[01:55:17.654 --> 01:55:17.994]  All right.
[01:55:18.655 --> 01:55:19.995]  Michael Yon, great job.
[01:55:20.215 --> 01:55:23.976]  Michael underscore Yon on X and Anne VanderSteel as well.
[01:55:23.996 --> 01:55:26.536]  People can find her very, very easily as well.
[01:55:26.576 --> 01:55:27.777]  We've been putting that on screen.
[01:55:28.077 --> 01:55:29.637]  We'll talk to you guys both very soon.
[01:55:29.657 --> 01:55:30.097]  God bless.
[01:55:31.278 --> 01:55:31.878]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:55:31.958 --> 01:55:32.578]  Thank you, Alex.

[01:59:18.783 --> 01:59:19.804]  People loved it so much.
[01:59:19.824 --> 01:59:20.785]  They had such great effects.

[01:59:29.814 --> 01:59:34.638]  The other one was great, but one that's even better with even higher quality ingredients at a lower price.
[01:59:35.652 --> 01:59:38.033]  So I could never offer nitric boosts.
[01:59:38.073 --> 01:59:39.534]  It cost us so much to make.
[01:59:40.355 --> 01:59:42.576]  And now we can offer it for 40% off.
[01:59:43.136 --> 01:59:46.898]  Infowarrestore.com nitric boosts finally back in stock.
[01:59:46.918 --> 01:59:48.539]  40% off out of the gates.
[01:59:50.260 --> 01:59:54.363]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:54.883 --> 01:59:56.164]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:18.988 --> 02:00:23.235]  Putin has made it clear in several interviews that he is well aware of how U.S.
[02:00:23.315 --> 02:00:25.659]  presidents come and go, and U.S.
[02:00:25.720 --> 02:00:27.022]  policy never changes.
[02:00:32.256 --> 02:00:35.499]  Presidents come and go, but politics don't change.
[02:00:35.519 --> 02:00:36.680]  Do you know why?
[02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:39.242]  Because the power of bureaucracy is very strong.
[02:00:39.282 --> 02:00:50.472]  A person is elected, he comes with some ideas, people come to him with cases, well-dressed, and in dark suits, like mine, but not with a red tie, but with a black one, or with a dark blue one, and they begin to explain how to do it.
[02:00:50.712 --> 02:00:52.534]  And everything immediately changes, you see?
[02:00:52.614 --> 02:00:55.617]  And this happens from one administration to another.
[02:00:58.598 --> 02:01:10.307]  Putin is well aware that it is the CIA who directs US policy, and it is the intelligence agencies of NATO countries who have been covertly instigating war with Russia for decades.
[02:01:11.088 --> 02:01:22.877]  In the Tucker Carlson interview at the Kremlin, President Putin seemed to be speaking directly to the CIA, twice playfully hinting that Tucker is a representative of the intelligence organization.
[02:01:23.718 --> 02:01:24.839]  With the backing of whom?
[02:01:29.579 --> 02:01:31.261]  With the backing of CIA, of course.
[02:01:32.082 --> 02:01:35.587]  The organization you wanted to join back in the day, as I understand.
[02:01:37.009 --> 02:01:38.751]  We should thank God they didn't let you in.
[02:01:38.771 --> 02:01:41.936]  Although, it is a serious organization.
[02:01:42.577 --> 02:01:43.137]  I understand.
[02:01:43.157 --> 02:01:44.900]  Who blew up Nord Stream?
[02:01:48.503 --> 02:01:49.144]  You, for sure.
[02:01:50.066 --> 02:01:50.987]  I was busy that day.
[02:01:55.734 --> 02:01:56.836]  I did not blow up Nord Stream.
[02:01:57.857 --> 02:01:58.578]  Thank you, though.
[02:02:02.481 --> 02:02:06.563]  You personally may have an alibi, but the CIA has no such alibi.
[02:02:06.943 --> 02:02:17.327]  And the CIA responded to Putin via their New York Times media outlet in the recent article, The Spy War, How the CIA Secretly Helps Ukraine Fight Putin.
[02:02:17.887 --> 02:02:30.112]  The article admits that the CIA, operating through three different presidential administrations, has transformed the Ukraine into Washington's most important intelligence partners against the Kremlin.
[02:02:30.712 --> 02:02:44.102]  They have secretly trained and equipped Ukrainian intelligence officers over the past decade and constructed a network of 12 secret bases along the Russian border used to launch cross-border attacks on Russian territory.
[02:02:44.602 --> 02:02:50.687]  This means the CIA is responsible for the attacks on oil refineries and energy infrastructure.
[02:02:51.207 --> 02:02:59.172]  The article describes secret underground command centers established near the Russian border, financed and equipped by the CIA.
[02:02:59.712 --> 02:03:09.938]  A CIA program called Operation Goldfish enabled Ukrainians to hack into Russian military networks, break into satellites, and decode secret conversations.
[02:03:10.538 --> 02:03:22.262]  Two years after the 2014 Western-backed coup in Ukraine, the CIA set up training programs for an elite Ukrainian commando force known as Unit 2245.
[02:03:22.822 --> 02:03:30.845]  The CIA trained Ukrainian spies who operate inside of Russia, across Europe, and in other places where Russia operates.
[02:03:31.466 --> 02:03:35.007]  The article points out that this operation may have been hidden from Trump.
[02:03:35.507 --> 02:03:49.234]  While Trump's rhetoric was friendly to Russia, his administration of anti-Russia war hawks, such as Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, kept Western aggression moving forward, which is what Putin has been pointing out for years.
[02:03:49.714 --> 02:03:52.696]  Presidents come and go, and the policy never changes.
[02:03:53.556 --> 02:03:59.738]  The article says nothing about the several bioweapons labs that the US admitted to having along Russia's border.
[02:04:00.239 --> 02:04:07.821]  Some of these labs were seized by the Russian Federation, who say they are preparing to release a report on them, but have so far remained silent.
[02:04:08.822 --> 02:04:19.126]  Putin has made it clear that Russia's actions in Ukraine was in response to decades of hostile US-NATO military expansion on Russian borders.
[02:04:19.646 --> 02:04:22.347]  And the CIA is now admitting this to be true.
[02:04:23.533 --> 02:04:26.053]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[02:04:42.696 --> 02:04:44.857]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:04:45.397 --> 02:04:50.658]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.

[02:05:29.666 --> 02:05:30.207]  40% off.
[02:05:30.247 --> 02:05:31.808]  We've been selling Nitric Boost for a couple years.
[02:05:31.908 --> 02:05:34.990]  Never had it below $25 because there was hardly any profit there.
[02:05:35.050 --> 02:05:37.953]  We went to a place that gives us stuff just as good or even better.
[02:05:37.973 --> 02:05:38.914]  That's where we're getting it from.

[02:05:53.925 --> 02:05:55.787]  InfoWarsTore.com, Turbo Force.
[02:06:02.046 --> 02:06:02.948]  You found it!
[02:06:03.288 --> 02:06:04.791]  The tip of the spear!
[02:06:05.311 --> 02:06:07.575]  It is the Alex Jones Show!
[02:06:19.415 --> 02:06:27.703]  Well, they wanted to get Benny Johnson, who's an explosively successful talk show host, on for a month or two.
[02:06:27.723 --> 02:06:32.888]  Well, his show, great guy, really smart, and you can find him at Benny Johnson.
[02:06:33.969 --> 02:06:37.871]  On X, on YouTube, you name it, reaching millions and millions of people a day.
[02:06:37.891 --> 02:06:48.197]  He's got limited time with us here, and he wanted to get into, and I wanted to cover it as well, the Fannie Willis case that just shows the tyranny of the weaponized judiciary and court system, and Nikki Haley, what a joke.
[02:06:48.697 --> 02:06:57.102]  But obviously, since he was set up a few days ago for the show, we have the ultra-massive 9-0 Supreme Court ruling, and that
[02:06:57.822 --> 02:07:01.745]  Statement to the lawfare and all of it with the Democrats saying it's a fraud.
[02:07:02.045 --> 02:07:05.468]  Then the ruling where they say you're making Trump a slave.
[02:07:05.768 --> 02:07:08.530]  He's never even been indicted or convicted of insurrection.
[02:07:09.451 --> 02:07:13.794]  They said we can't believe it's on its face that you couldn't do something like this.
[02:07:13.854 --> 02:07:16.036]  So a major repudiation.
[02:07:16.876 --> 02:07:18.678]  After Benny leaves us, I got clips to the left.
[02:07:19.338 --> 02:07:22.740]  Members of Congress, Raskin, all of them going into conniption fits.
[02:07:22.760 --> 02:07:23.661]  They want to pack the court.
[02:07:24.121 --> 02:07:30.886]  But I really cannot overstate how big this is as a bellwether signaling where the Supreme Court's going to do coming back to sanity.
[02:07:31.386 --> 02:07:32.027]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[02:07:32.067 --> 02:07:33.788]  Benny Johnson, thank you so much for the time.
[02:07:34.048 --> 02:07:35.109]  Let's tackle this right now.
[02:07:35.169 --> 02:07:36.770]  What's your take on this historic development?
[02:07:37.796 --> 02:07:43.640]  Well, this is speaking doom to all of the lawfare attempts to strip Donald Trump from the ballot.
[02:07:43.981 --> 02:07:45.062]  It is fascism.
[02:07:45.802 --> 02:07:47.023]  This is fascistic.
[02:07:47.163 --> 02:07:49.025]  They simply want to stop you from voting.
[02:07:49.045 --> 02:07:56.130]  In fact, the Secretary of State in Colorado just came out and said, well, unfortunately we failed and now the voters will have to decide.
[02:07:56.170 --> 02:07:57.031]  This is her statement.
[02:07:57.631 --> 02:07:59.912]  This is her statement on MSNBC just a few seconds ago.
[02:08:00.252 --> 02:08:00.573]  Oh, I know.
[02:08:00.633 --> 02:08:01.313]  I have the clip.
[02:08:01.373 --> 02:08:01.873]  I have the clip.
[02:08:01.893 --> 02:08:02.874]  I was going to play it after you go.
[02:08:03.154 --> 02:08:05.975]  She actually says, I mean, they're pulling up now.
[02:08:06.435 --> 02:08:10.077]  A radical Democrat Colorado Secretary of State disappointed.
[02:08:10.177 --> 02:08:11.478]  Now it's up to the voters.
[02:08:11.578 --> 02:08:13.759]  I mean, we're getting the clip now.
[02:08:14.079 --> 02:08:15.220]  I mean, what the hell?
[02:08:15.840 --> 02:08:17.421]  We're protecting democracy!
[02:08:17.841 --> 02:08:20.042]  But Alex, we're protecting democracy!
[02:08:20.182 --> 02:08:20.662]  Oh my god.
[02:08:20.682 --> 02:08:24.844]  The voters... The Babylon Bee has a great article, a great headline, of course, naturally.
[02:08:25.764 --> 02:08:30.266]  Democrats furious that voters will get to decide who they vote for now.
[02:08:30.606 --> 02:08:37.629]  But the democracy protection has gone full, like, this is fine dog inside of the burning house.
[02:08:37.989 --> 02:08:42.391]  The Secretary of State of Colorado giving up the ghost, telling us exactly what this was all about.
[02:08:42.771 --> 02:08:51.718]  This was about stopping you from voting for the candidate of your choice in November in 2024, and they are now being repudiated, and it is blowing up in their face.
[02:08:51.918 --> 02:08:54.781]  I mean, it's actually really entertaining.
[02:08:55.221 --> 02:09:07.431]  If you watch these Fannie Willis trials, if you actually look at the panic and the rock salt full of sodium, like salty tears rolling through the streets of Washington, D.C., like a flood, you could take a gondola.
[02:09:07.871 --> 02:09:14.974]  Down the streets of DC, the amount of rock salt, the amount of tears that are flooding the streets there, you need a rubber dinghy just to survive.
[02:09:15.574 --> 02:09:27.640]  And the Supreme Court in a 9-0 repudiation, which was joined by justices like Joe Biden's justice of the Supreme Court, Barack Obama's justice of the Supreme Court, which joined with the conservatives saying,
[02:09:29.244 --> 02:09:32.147]  Y'all have lost your damn minds in doing this.
[02:09:32.607 --> 02:09:34.269]  Like, not even we can side with you.
[02:09:34.329 --> 02:09:35.610]  I mean, they'll side with anything.
[02:09:36.971 --> 02:09:42.336]  It really is possibly the worst day to be a leftist, potentially, in modern history.
[02:09:42.877 --> 02:09:45.800]  And you've just never seen more of a collapse, I think, on more fronts.
[02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:47.921]  Which is what's really inspiring for us.
[02:09:48.341 --> 02:09:57.588]  We just had like a three-hour celebration on our... It's really hard to see where the left is winning now, as the cases simultaneously collapse.
[02:09:57.648 --> 02:10:04.713]  Jack Smith, Fannie Willis, now this case from Colorado, the state of Maine, and then a traffic judge in...
[02:10:05.433 --> 02:10:05.713]  I don't
[02:10:22.429 --> 02:10:23.791]  Didn't even have a jury.
[02:10:23.831 --> 02:10:24.912]  Didn't even have a court hearing.
[02:10:25.593 --> 02:10:28.596]  Just said, well, I had some witnesses, two witnesses that were Democrats.
[02:10:28.657 --> 02:10:31.079]  They said, oh, we're taking off the ballot there.
[02:10:31.160 --> 02:10:34.804]  So we keep asking, where is the bottom of the insanity?
[02:10:35.224 --> 02:10:40.130]  And I really think that the state ruling with no jury a few weeks ago
[02:10:40.891 --> 02:10:43.932]  Trying to take Trump's real estate empire with no victims there.
[02:10:44.372 --> 02:10:45.953]  As he said, you know, paid it all off.
[02:10:45.973 --> 02:10:47.334]  The banks want to do business with him again.
[02:10:47.354 --> 02:10:52.596]  As he says, a perfect, you know, transaction, which it was, according to the banks, worked out great.
[02:10:52.616 --> 02:10:54.517]  They were totally paid back ahead of time.
[02:10:55.377 --> 02:11:04.141]  Then if you look at that, it finally triggered a lot of people, even in the power structure, to say, is there no bottom to the lunacy?
[02:11:04.781 --> 02:11:09.803]  Sure, they hate Donald Trump and the power structure, but also they've got to hate what they've created in the name of countering Trump.
[02:11:11.257 --> 02:11:20.522]  So you, you know, you can see people vote with their feet and it doesn't really matter what politics you ascribe to in your cocktail circles.
[02:11:20.822 --> 02:11:29.366]  The realities of leftism has now taken hold and that seizing at the throats of the American public is happening in real time.
[02:11:29.386 --> 02:11:31.067]  You just saw Jeff Bezos move to Florida.
[02:11:31.778 --> 02:11:32.398]  Like, what's that about?
[02:11:32.519 --> 02:11:33.699]  Jeff Bezos just moved to Miami.
[02:11:33.739 --> 02:11:35.680]  He's like, I'm getting the hell out of Seattle.
[02:11:36.181 --> 02:11:36.841]  I'm getting the hell out.
[02:11:36.881 --> 02:11:37.602]  I'm getting out of there.
[02:11:38.022 --> 02:11:40.243]  Ken Griffin, he runs Citadel.
[02:11:40.263 --> 02:11:42.144]  That's the biggest hedge fund in the world.
[02:11:42.465 --> 02:11:44.926]  Ken Griffin just moved down to Florida, saying, I'm out.
[02:11:45.547 --> 02:11:52.751]  Elon Musk coming to Texas, I believe where you live, Alex, not too far down the road from you, relocating his entire business to Texas.
[02:11:53.291 --> 02:12:00.356]  That self-sorting is happening right now, and what you're gonna be left with, I think, in leftist cities is truly third world
[02:12:00.896 --> 02:12:05.620]  Third world hellhole populations that are going to be like no-go zones here in America.
[02:12:05.921 --> 02:12:10.325]  Meanwhile, the Bible Belt and states like Texas and Florida are going to flourish.
[02:12:10.705 --> 02:12:12.627]  Oh, and I forgot one final thing, Alex.
[02:12:12.727 --> 02:12:21.395]  The Supreme Court may get a chance to look at Texas immigration laws, but as of right now, your state of Texas is going to be able to enforce
[02:12:21.935 --> 02:12:22.916]  That's right.
[02:12:22.956 --> 02:12:25.418]  Speak to that, because I know that was just breaking as well.
[02:12:25.438 --> 02:12:27.359]  But after you speak to that huge development,
[02:12:46.553 --> 02:12:49.674]  Like the Wolf says in Pulp Fiction, let's not start celebrating quite yet.
[02:12:49.694 --> 02:12:50.954]  He says it a little bit in a crude way.
[02:12:51.774 --> 02:12:52.854]  They're going to strike back.
[02:12:53.174 --> 02:12:54.355]  They're not going to give up.
[02:12:55.195 --> 02:12:56.675]  The Democrats are now coming out.
[02:12:56.715 --> 02:12:57.715]  I've got a bunch of clips of it.
[02:12:58.355 --> 02:12:59.756]  After you leave, we'll play them.
[02:12:59.776 --> 02:13:05.217]  We'll also cut it back into the tape once we post the video in X so you can share it to your massive viral audience, hopefully.
[02:13:05.257 --> 02:13:07.477]  But Benny Johnson, they're going to strike back.
[02:13:08.237 --> 02:13:08.857]  They're dumb.
[02:13:08.917 --> 02:13:09.798]  They're humorous, Phil.
[02:13:09.818 --> 02:13:10.558]  They're out of control.
[02:13:10.598 --> 02:13:12.238]  But one thing that they never do is give up.
[02:13:12.558 --> 02:13:13.438]  They always double down.
[02:13:13.518 --> 02:13:15.819]  So I actually really am concerned about
[02:13:16.710 --> 02:13:30.255]  What they do now in their panic mode, it's kind of like in the first Blade Runner, you know, great film, when Harrison Ford shoots Pris and she's so mad she's gonna die, she throws that Kepler tantrum like a fish out of water flopping around.
[02:13:31.096 --> 02:13:32.816]  I think we're entering that phase here.
[02:13:33.177 --> 02:13:34.137]  Are you concerned about that?
[02:13:34.177 --> 02:13:36.418]  What do you think, looking into your crystal ball, they're gonna pull?
[02:13:38.385 --> 02:13:44.049]  I don't have a crystal ball, but I do believe that the panic that we saw was happening over the last two years.
[02:13:44.630 --> 02:13:46.531]  And now they're just, they're simply getting desperate.
[02:13:46.571 --> 02:13:48.893]  And you're the master at sort of seeing through these things.
[02:13:49.153 --> 02:13:51.915]  Hard to find a thing that Alex Jones hasn't predicted correctly.
[02:13:52.356 --> 02:13:57.620]  However, based on my limited knowledge and understanding here, they're beginning to simply exhaust
[02:13:58.320 --> 02:14:02.122]  Every opportunity they had to try and get Trump, Fulton, down in flames.
[02:14:02.142 --> 02:14:02.923]  Like, embarrassing.
[02:14:03.203 --> 02:14:03.863]  Humiliating.
[02:14:04.464 --> 02:14:06.525]  Um, daytime television, Jerry Springer stuff.
[02:14:06.965 --> 02:14:08.326]  The Fulton case will not be going forward.
[02:14:08.346 --> 02:14:09.287]  They'll be disqualified.
[02:14:09.527 --> 02:14:12.188]  Here, the Colorado case is down in flames, right?
[02:14:12.509 --> 02:14:16.351]  You have Jack Smith's case, which is an absolute abomination right now.
[02:14:16.411 --> 02:14:19.333]  Jack Smith's case is a good, this is a, this is a great point.
[02:14:19.773 --> 02:14:23.817]  Jack Smith's case was brought against presidential immunity question.
[02:14:23.837 --> 02:14:25.478]  That's going to be answered at the Supreme Court.
[02:14:25.498 --> 02:14:27.320]  Supreme Court's going to hear cases about January Sixers.
[02:14:28.161 --> 02:14:30.223]  And that's all of Jack Smith's case.
[02:14:30.983 --> 02:14:35.267]  Jack Smith's case is going to be left to like a little pittance, like a mean tweet here and there.
[02:14:35.748 --> 02:14:40.012]  The Supreme Court is going to gut everything that Jack Smith could potentially bring against Trump.
[02:14:40.692 --> 02:14:54.274]  And so, you're starting to reach panic time, and this is my assessment here, is that they are out of options, and now they're moving into the super state, ghost in the machine containment.
[02:14:55.043 --> 02:14:55.663]  Of Donald Trump.
[02:14:56.124 --> 02:15:00.506]  So they're gonna try Russiagate 3.0 on Donald Trump when he is elected president.
[02:15:01.087 --> 02:15:02.428]  Donald Trump will be elected president.
[02:15:02.888 --> 02:15:07.911]  And they're going to now attempt to stop him with the Pentagon, with the Superstate.
[02:15:08.231 --> 02:15:13.795]  You're already seeing articles in NBC News talking about how the Pentagon is starting to put in a network.
[02:15:14.215 --> 02:15:16.477]  To stop Donald Trump's dictatorial powers.
[02:15:33.372 --> 02:15:41.514]  Oh, we need the Pentagon to restrain Trump, and we need laws that he can't call the military out during an insurrection like George Herbert Walker Bush did in 1992 with the L.A.
[02:15:41.554 --> 02:15:41.854]  riots.
[02:15:41.894 --> 02:15:51.596]  So they're saying plan B is, it looks like he's going to win by landslide, we can't stop him, but folks, don't take that to the bank because we still have to believe, you know, we've got to have a landslider to beat this fraud.
[02:15:52.136 --> 02:15:56.917]  Then they're going to go with national riots, race war, and then when he tries to call the military out,
[02:15:57.637 --> 02:15:59.061]  Then say, oh look, he's a dictator.
[02:15:59.081 --> 02:16:03.371]  So yes, they're already pre-programming that and really capitulating that they can't stop him.
[02:16:04.602 --> 02:16:28.590]  Yeah, and I believe, and based on the attorneys that I've spoken to and the people who are very close to Trump in an orbit and legal circle, that they better be careful with these race riots because this section 1512c2 could actually be used against a real insurrection, like a real insurrection that happened on May the 20th of 2020 at the White House when Donald Trump had to be taken into a safe room because leftist orcs stormed the White House like it was Helms Deep.
[02:16:29.350 --> 02:16:35.091]  And injured a bunch of Secret Service officers, injured a bunch of cops, that's actually interfering with an official proceeding, right?
[02:16:35.131 --> 02:16:37.272]  Like, you're threatening the President's life.
[02:16:37.812 --> 02:16:49.775]  And so you gotta, I mean, they best be very, very careful because turnabout's fair play here, and they may find themselves on the receiving end of a Donald Trump administration that isn't going to F around anymore.
[02:16:51.601 --> 02:16:52.142]  But we'll see.
[02:16:52.202 --> 02:16:55.584]  I mean, again, I firmly believe, Alex, that they're moving into the containment.
[02:16:56.005 --> 02:16:57.426]  So you saw Donald Trump.
[02:16:57.446 --> 02:16:59.208]  Here's what made me finally say, yep, this is what's happening.
[02:16:59.408 --> 02:17:03.191]  Donald Trump unveiled brand new messaging this weekend saying, too big, too rigged.
[02:17:03.792 --> 02:17:05.133]  He had it printed on signs and everything.
[02:17:05.153 --> 02:17:06.974]  It wasn't just an off-the-cuff statement.
[02:17:07.155 --> 02:17:08.015]  He had it printed on signs.
[02:17:08.055 --> 02:17:10.898]  That's going to be the marching mantra into the conventions.
[02:17:11.398 --> 02:17:12.300]  At the end of July.
[02:17:12.700 --> 02:17:13.682]  Too big to rig.
[02:17:14.423 --> 02:17:18.909]  And I believe that what that really signals is that there's so much support for Donald Trump.
[02:17:19.350 --> 02:17:22.535]  The system is just collapsing and they're not going to be able to stop it.
[02:17:22.575 --> 02:17:25.940]  They're not going to be able to do the mirage, the blue mirage or anything like that.
[02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:29.284]  Oh, the machines have decided to stop counting votes!
[02:17:29.524 --> 02:17:34.149]  It's election night in just five swing states, and the water pipes have all broken, and whatever.
[02:17:34.249 --> 02:17:35.351]  They're not gonna be able to do that again.
[02:17:35.371 --> 02:17:38.915]  The system has already faced so many questions of its own integrity.
[02:17:39.215 --> 02:17:45.122]  Federal law enforcement, the electoral system, they've already damaged themselves too much, so they're going to allow Trump to win?
[02:17:45.603 --> 02:17:46.464]  And now, like,
[02:17:46.924 --> 02:17:52.727]  We should move on to saying, wait a second, like they're gonna try and pull Russiagate 3.0 on Trump.
[02:17:52.867 --> 02:18:00.450]  They're already trying to box him in and put bumper cars on him when he becomes president, and that needs to be like a major focus heading forward.
[02:18:01.522 --> 02:18:08.306]  I want to talk about the children because it came out when I said years ago the CIA has been running the attack for 10 years against Russia and Ukraine.
[02:18:08.646 --> 02:18:09.387]  They started it.
[02:18:09.407 --> 02:18:10.507]  Now they're bragging about it.
[02:18:11.168 --> 02:18:13.049]  I mean, it's really out in the open.
[02:18:13.069 --> 02:18:14.270]  But let's talk about our children.
[02:18:14.310 --> 02:18:16.911]  Let's put a post you put last week on X that I put up.
[02:18:18.032 --> 02:18:21.494]  You said, don't care how much money you have, don't care about
[02:18:22.315 --> 02:18:31.008]  Your portfolio, don't care about your crypto, don't care about offshore accounts, don't care about your cars, watches or bourbon collection.
[02:18:31.949 --> 02:18:36.756]  Men, real men's wealth is coming from getting mobbed by your children.
[02:18:36.796 --> 02:18:37.417]  This is rich.
[02:18:38.078 --> 02:18:44.022]  And that's what they're coming for, our children's hearts, our souls, their minds, their future, and their very existence with this.
[02:18:44.502 --> 02:18:49.745]  The globalists stole civilization and then sell it back to us in pieces if we sell ourselves.
[02:18:50.145 --> 02:18:51.186]  It's all a lie.
[02:18:51.846 --> 02:18:57.250]  It needs to be destroyed to restore the human dignity and the future of our population.
[02:18:57.610 --> 02:19:00.752]  Can you speak here to the children and why they're the target of the enemy?
[02:19:01.806 --> 02:19:05.288]  Yeah, well, I mean, you can go back, of course, to biblical times.
[02:19:05.308 --> 02:19:13.094]  You can go back to Christ himself saying, don't harm a hair on the head of these children, otherwise you'll have a giant stone tied around your neck, thrown in the ocean.
[02:19:13.474 --> 02:19:16.576]  That'd be better for you than what awaits you.
[02:19:17.037 --> 02:19:23.701]  It is our obligation as a nation, as Christians, to defend our children.
[02:19:24.922 --> 02:19:25.903]  We don't have a choice.
[02:19:26.143 --> 02:19:27.383]  We are called to do that.
[02:19:27.423 --> 02:19:28.544]  We are instructed to do so.
[02:19:28.884 --> 02:19:32.846]  Christ also says, of course, you'll never inherit the Kingdom of Heaven unless you act like these children.
[02:19:32.866 --> 02:19:40.869]  Unless you're as pure and as simple and as believing as these children, right?
[02:19:41.229 --> 02:19:45.171]  And so it's our calling to simply look at the world through binaries.
[02:19:45.771 --> 02:20:02.075]  There is a suicide pact that wishes to destroy children, that wishes to destroy the family, that wishes to destroy the fabric of civilization, that is a suicide cult, it's existed forever, it's always demonic, it's always driven by the forces of evil, and the number one way to counteract that
[02:20:02.595 --> 02:20:16.721]  Is to fall in love, to make a family unit, to have children, and to get the extreme purpose, the spiritual value in knowing that you are a man defending your family.
[02:20:16.781 --> 02:20:22.284]  That you have a righteous and noble cause, and that cause is not flesh and blood, but is spiritual in nature.
[02:20:23.544 --> 02:20:26.946]  Adds so much motivation to my life every single day, having three kids.
[02:20:27.586 --> 02:20:29.627]  I know it does to your life, Alex.
[02:20:30.008 --> 02:20:35.311]  And I would say with that tweet, the only whiskey or bourbon I do care about, of course, is your, uh, your whiskey.
[02:20:35.791 --> 02:20:39.593]  Um, which I certainly look forward to trying, um, sometime when we're in Texas together.
[02:20:41.750 --> 02:20:42.631]  Absolutely, brother.
[02:20:43.171 --> 02:20:44.452]  We have the clip you mentioned.
[02:20:44.492 --> 02:20:46.213]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[02:20:46.253 --> 02:20:49.636]  I'm sure I haven't checked your ex account, but I'm sure it's up at Benny Johnson.
[02:20:49.656 --> 02:20:50.756]  Everybody should follow you there.
[02:20:51.577 --> 02:20:53.779]  And us at RealAlexJones, you at Benny Johnson.
[02:20:54.639 --> 02:21:04.186]  But here is the far-left, literally Soros-financed Colorado Secretary of State who tried to keep GOP President Kennedy Trump off the ballot.
[02:21:05.067 --> 02:21:07.888]  Here is this peonic creature.
[02:21:09.156 --> 02:21:11.278]  Saying now it's up to the voters to save democracy.
[02:21:11.298 --> 02:21:14.481]  So it was up to her first in a court that there was no victim.
[02:21:14.561 --> 02:21:15.421]  No one was indicted.
[02:21:15.441 --> 02:21:16.703]  No one was convicted.
[02:21:16.783 --> 02:21:17.864]  They've been totally repudiated.
[02:21:17.884 --> 02:21:20.786]  And now she says it's up to the voter.
[02:21:20.806 --> 02:21:23.508]  Well, it was always up to the voter, you little witch.
[02:21:23.548 --> 02:21:23.969]  Here it is.
[02:21:25.387 --> 02:21:27.808]  My larger reaction is disappointment.
[02:21:28.189 --> 02:21:34.352]  I do believe that states should be able, under our Constitution, to bar oath-breaking insurrectionists.
[02:21:35.252 --> 02:21:42.636]  And ultimately, this decision leaves open the door for Congress to act to pass authorizing legislation.
[02:21:43.497 --> 02:21:47.539]  But we know that Congress is a nearly non-functioning body.
[02:21:48.379 --> 02:21:53.002]  So ultimately, it will be up to the American voters to save our democracy in November.
[02:21:54.124 --> 02:21:57.165]  Another robot Soros puppet they give the talking points to.
[02:21:57.185 --> 02:21:58.566]  I could teach a college course.
[02:21:59.246 --> 02:22:02.968]  Hell, I could teach a whole degree just in that 25-second clip.
[02:22:04.369 --> 02:22:06.089]  It's good to have gridlock when you have tyranny.
[02:22:06.109 --> 02:22:07.350]  That's why you have separation of powers.
[02:22:07.390 --> 02:22:08.510]  You don't want a smooth system.
[02:22:08.530 --> 02:22:09.811]  That's how you get Napoleon or Hitler.
[02:22:10.731 --> 02:22:16.254]  And she says right there that we have this oath-breaking person.
[02:22:17.439 --> 02:22:20.281]  So now, who convicted him of oath-breaking?
[02:22:20.341 --> 02:22:25.043]  Again, he's not found guilty, he's not even indicted, but she just declares him a criminal.
[02:22:25.544 --> 02:22:27.825]  No, you are the criminal by your actions.
[02:22:28.665 --> 02:22:37.490]  I'm not a vindictive person, but we need George Soros and his son indicted for the racketeering, going in and paying off judges, putting in thousands of DAs and county attorneys.
[02:22:39.031 --> 02:22:40.072]  It's organized crime.
[02:22:40.092 --> 02:22:43.135]  My God, if the Italian mafia tried this, they'd all be in Gitmo right now.
[02:22:43.516 --> 02:22:50.903]  Why the hell is George Soros and the Democratic Party, and John Brennan, and I'm naming names right now, folks love to do this, Benny Johnson.
[02:22:52.694 --> 02:22:53.174]  I don't know.
[02:22:53.895 --> 02:23:04.203]  For the life of me, I can't figure out why the amount of foreign money that comes from this Open Society Foundation, that comes from the Soros Pots of Wealth, why that is allowed to pour into our system.
[02:23:04.423 --> 02:23:05.224]  I thought that was bad.
[02:23:05.244 --> 02:23:06.945]  Wasn't that what Russiagate was all about?
[02:23:07.986 --> 02:23:09.187]  Wasn't that the point?
[02:23:09.508 --> 02:23:10.228]  Wasn't that the point?
[02:23:10.328 --> 02:23:13.591]  That Russians donated to Donald Trump one time or something like that?
[02:23:13.611 --> 02:23:17.274]  That Donald Trump received some foreign assistance from somewhere?
[02:23:18.243 --> 02:23:29.391]  To become president yet George Soros is allowed to go through and to pour into our system so much dark money cash and it is utterly destroyed the nation.
[02:23:30.151 --> 02:23:34.955]  Obviously like you can trace back and it's wild if you want to bring RICO cases.
[02:23:35.635 --> 02:23:35.875]  Right?
[02:23:35.935 --> 02:23:37.416]  Like, you could talk about Lake and Riley.
[02:23:38.016 --> 02:23:42.197]  Like, why not start charging people who are responsible for open borders?
[02:23:42.397 --> 02:23:44.938]  I mean, the Open Society Foundation would certainly be one of them.
[02:23:45.478 --> 02:23:45.638]  Right?
[02:23:45.658 --> 02:23:51.160]  But you can go directly back to 10 million counts of human and child smuggling via Joe Biden.
[02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:59.123]  The monster who killed Lake and Riley in Georgia was released by Democrats in New York.
[02:23:59.343 --> 02:24:01.704]  He was already committing felonous acts and criminal acts.
[02:24:02.404 --> 02:24:03.604]  And they released him.
[02:24:03.644 --> 02:24:05.885]  They put him back out on the street to murder again.
[02:24:06.825 --> 02:24:07.885]  These people are monsters.
[02:24:07.945 --> 02:24:09.386]  There are monsters in society.
[02:24:09.486 --> 02:24:12.546]  It's our spiritual obligation and moral obligation to fight them.
[02:24:13.407 --> 02:24:22.129]  And I personally believe that they want things to get so bad, Alex, they want things to become so scary, that we will turn over all of our rights for protection.
[02:24:22.609 --> 02:24:24.209]  Well, Benny Johnson, you are 110% right.
[02:24:24.229 --> 02:24:25.230]  They admit they want to destabilize.
[02:24:27.824 --> 02:24:28.825]  But no, we know it's them!
[02:24:49.419 --> 02:24:58.847]  And so now all the most popular talk shows, all of them, I mean, I could take the top three or four top talk show hosts, find the globalists, and they have more audience than all the mainstream media.
[02:24:59.167 --> 02:25:05.772]  Then you look down to the top hundred, and I would say you're in the top 20 or so, and rising, just love seeing all the great talent.
[02:25:06.713 --> 02:25:08.214]  Because that's the sign of our victory, folks.
[02:25:08.234 --> 02:25:10.776]  I want to be made obsolete by other people better than me.
[02:25:11.256 --> 02:25:12.096]  I want to beat these people.
[02:25:12.116 --> 02:25:12.797]  That's my main mission.
[02:25:12.837 --> 02:25:20.361]  But literally, we control now, even though we're censored, I'd say 60-70% of the conversation, and it's growing daily.
[02:25:20.621 --> 02:25:21.842]  I mean, it's over!
[02:25:21.862 --> 02:25:22.523]  If I was an FBI...
[02:25:23.243 --> 02:25:26.368]  Hostage rescue, you know, person, I'm saying, come out, bank robbers!
[02:25:26.728 --> 02:25:31.215]  You'll get 30 years in prison, but at least you won't get killed or, you know, put in the electric chair.
[02:25:31.315 --> 02:25:32.637]  Come out now, you've already lost.
[02:25:33.138 --> 02:25:34.219]  You're totally surrounded.
[02:25:34.239 --> 02:25:35.801]  500 men surround you.
[02:25:36.022 --> 02:25:36.863]  They're done.
[02:25:37.243 --> 02:25:37.884]  It's over.
[02:25:41.119 --> 02:25:43.501]  I believe that we do fight a spiritual battle.
[02:25:44.101 --> 02:25:45.622]  I truly believe that in my heart, Alex.
[02:25:46.182 --> 02:25:48.844]  And that God will be victorious, right?
[02:25:48.884 --> 02:25:51.285]  That we will be on the side of right.
[02:25:51.725 --> 02:25:59.109]  And that what we are fighting right now is a force that is acting against human nature.
[02:25:59.129 --> 02:26:00.550]  And that's why they want the destruction of the family.
[02:26:00.730 --> 02:26:02.851]  They don't want you to feel the purpose of fatherhood.
[02:26:03.411 --> 02:26:11.693]  They don't want you to feel the purpose of holding your newborn child in your arms and knowing that that is an angel, a literal angel, literal spiritual gift, a gift from God.
[02:26:12.573 --> 02:26:13.934]  It has the potential.
[02:26:14.014 --> 02:26:19.515]  It has, just like Genesis says, made the image of God, not God, but little G. It has all the potential of the universe in it.
[02:26:19.555 --> 02:26:20.775]  It is an angel at that point.
[02:26:21.095 --> 02:26:23.616]  It's up to parents and culture to make it the angel it can be.
[02:26:24.411 --> 02:26:24.671]  Yes.
[02:26:25.051 --> 02:26:25.332]  Yes.
[02:26:25.652 --> 02:26:26.773]  And you're seeing trends right now.
[02:26:26.833 --> 02:26:27.693]  Tradwife trends.
[02:26:27.713 --> 02:26:39.821]  I mean, you're seeing trends of going back to a time when the globalists and when these people who quite literally are dark and demonic, filled with dark and demonic energy.
[02:26:39.841 --> 02:26:41.382]  There's no other way to describe it, right?
[02:26:41.402 --> 02:26:44.484]  When you talk about depopulation or mass slaughter of children.
[02:26:46.946 --> 02:26:47.826]  I mean, I felt a shift.
[02:27:08.291 --> 02:27:10.434]  I felt it shift big time in our favor two years ago.
[02:27:10.454 --> 02:27:19.785]  About a year ago, I felt it tip in our favor over the top, and now I feel a mass, rushing, explosive awakening, and everything's shifting right now, like a pole shift.
[02:27:20.206 --> 02:27:22.709]  And that's why I'm saying the enemy's gonna throw everything they got at us now.
[02:27:22.729 --> 02:27:24.110]  They're gonna try to start World War III.
[02:27:26.355 --> 02:27:33.958]  Well, that's right, and they're trying their level-headed best, and the only way they actually get it to pop off is if they can keep Donald Trump out of office.
[02:27:34.558 --> 02:27:39.580]  I believe that with Donald Trump in office, that world peace will actually come roaring in.
[02:27:39.620 --> 02:27:43.782]  I mean, this is the man, of course, who walked into... I don't think most people understand.
[02:27:45.399 --> 02:27:47.580]  North Korea is still at war with America.
[02:27:47.600 --> 02:27:49.461]  Do you realize there was no peace treaty signed?
[02:27:50.162 --> 02:27:55.785]  So let's just take this one instance where Donald Trump is welcomed in North Korea by Kim Jong-un, who was fangirling over him the entire time.
[02:27:56.185 --> 02:27:56.365]  Right?
[02:27:56.525 --> 02:27:57.505]  They give him a big hug.
[02:27:57.526 --> 02:27:59.386]  Have you ever seen Kim Jong-un hug anyone?
[02:27:59.867 --> 02:28:03.349]  He like claps Donald Trump on the back and Trump like grabs his shoulder and shakes him.
[02:28:03.649 --> 02:28:04.789]  Like, think about this.
[02:28:05.290 --> 02:28:07.151]  That's a nation that we were at war with.
[02:28:07.591 --> 02:28:10.192]  They have never signed an official peace treaty with us.
[02:28:10.212 --> 02:28:11.253]  Yeah, all we have is a ceasefire.
[02:28:12.469 --> 02:28:12.829]  That's it.
[02:28:13.470 --> 02:28:27.266]  And so you have the leader of this nation, this hermit communist nation, that is embracing Donald Trump and hugging him, inviting him in with a giant smile into the hermit kingdom of North Korea.
[02:28:28.107 --> 02:28:29.388]  Benny, I know you gotta go.
[02:28:29.789 --> 02:28:32.052]  I know you gotta go, but can you do five more minutes on the side with us?
[02:28:33.097 --> 02:28:33.637]  Of course, yeah.

[02:29:44.022 --> 02:29:44.542]  Hello Americans.
[02:29:44.562 --> 02:29:46.284]  I want to share with you a story.
[02:29:46.304 --> 02:29:50.887]  A story about inflammation, the silent menace that lurks within our bodies, affecting our health and well-being.
[02:29:50.907 --> 02:29:53.189]  Inflammation, the root cause of countless ailments.
[02:30:13.407 --> 02:30:15.329]  Quietly wreaking havoc over time.
[02:30:16.350 --> 02:30:20.433]  Long-term exposure to inflammation has been linked to a myriad of health issues.
[02:30:20.894 --> 02:30:24.056]  From heart disease to arthritis, even cognitive decline.
[02:30:25.057 --> 02:30:29.061]  But fear not, for there's a beacon of hope found in the wisdom of nature.
[02:30:29.761 --> 02:30:32.624]  A remedy that has stood the test of time, turmeric.

[02:30:58.447 --> 02:31:00.989]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalists.

[02:31:58.226 --> 02:32:03.550]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing, high-quality coffee has not been available.
[02:32:03.990 --> 02:32:08.354]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[02:32:08.834 --> 02:32:11.296]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[02:32:11.856 --> 02:32:21.244]  But now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.

[02:32:59.417 --> 02:33:05.359]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:09.840 --> 02:33:12.921]  I've got a Tiger Mouse tail!
[02:33:20.487 --> 02:33:22.269]  He never gives up.
[02:33:22.749 --> 02:33:24.610]  He's Alex Jones.
[02:33:24.791 --> 02:33:27.293]  Broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas.
[02:33:27.633 --> 02:33:28.273]  Worldwide.
[02:33:34.654 --> 02:33:36.616]  I've got a tiger by the tail!
[02:33:56.499 --> 02:34:04.734]  Well, the whole New World Order is finding out they got a tiger by the tail and great talk show host Benny Johnson is our guest for a few more minutes.
[02:34:04.935 --> 02:34:09.083]  Benny, I already said this earlier, but I want to focus back on this and any other key points you want to add.
[02:34:11.391 --> 02:34:12.792]  What does the establishment do now?
[02:34:12.912 --> 02:34:14.132]  What are they going to try to throw at us?
[02:34:14.172 --> 02:34:18.675]  They admit they're pre-programming the military, as we mentioned, for domestic operations.
[02:34:19.215 --> 02:34:20.816]  They're going to try to create a race war.
[02:34:21.656 --> 02:34:22.296]  But I agree with you.
[02:34:22.316 --> 02:34:26.078]  They're more and more moving towards, OK, Trump's going to win, nothing can stop him.
[02:34:26.098 --> 02:34:32.161]  And then they're now going to try to surround him again, do the same thing, 2.0, with the whole Russiagate thing.
[02:34:32.361 --> 02:34:33.902]  But people aren't going to buy that this time.
[02:34:34.182 --> 02:34:35.883]  So what are you expecting is going to happen?
[02:34:37.304 --> 02:34:43.546]  Well, I mean, yeah, I mean, the backlash is officially here and the boomerang is officially here in our studio.
[02:34:43.566 --> 02:34:51.689]  I don't know if your viewers can see, but because I don't have a confidence monitor right now, but like we have a giant Donald Trump
[02:34:52.679 --> 02:34:53.740]  We see it.
[02:34:53.860 --> 02:34:54.261]  We see it.
[02:35:17.142 --> 02:35:18.382]  Yeah, it was a novelty then, not survival.
[02:35:39.482 --> 02:35:39.942]  That's right.
[02:35:40.323 --> 02:35:43.544]  And then in 2020, there was something totally different.
[02:35:43.564 --> 02:35:45.946]  There were so many different competing narratives.
[02:35:45.966 --> 02:35:47.407]  It's hard to just keep track.
[02:35:48.167 --> 02:35:50.048]  I think they tried to exhaust everyone.
[02:35:50.389 --> 02:35:53.210]  And I think they got about doing that and scaremongering.
[02:35:53.611 --> 02:35:56.112]  And now, people are saying, I'm done.
[02:35:56.392 --> 02:35:58.073]  I'm done with this BS.
[02:35:59.174 --> 02:36:01.615]  The tricks have been worn out.
[02:36:02.116 --> 02:36:04.097]  That's why the mugshot is in the studio.
[02:36:05.578 --> 02:36:07.459]  Alex, everyone had a mugshot shirt on.
[02:36:08.514 --> 02:36:13.296]  All the people, like, one out of every three people were wearing Donald Trump's mugshot.
[02:36:14.116 --> 02:36:16.197]  They did the mugshot to embarrass Trump.
[02:36:16.377 --> 02:36:17.278]  They released the mugshot.
[02:36:17.298 --> 02:36:17.958]  This wasn't an accident.
[02:36:17.978 --> 02:36:22.540]  They did the mugshot in order to try and force him into a box and in order to try and embarrass MAGA.
[02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:23.940]  And it didn't work.
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:24.581]  It backfired.
[02:36:24.601 --> 02:36:26.101]  They make wrapping paper out of it.
[02:36:26.221 --> 02:36:27.282]  They put it on sheet cakes.
[02:36:28.022 --> 02:36:30.923]  Give it to your grandmother for her 90th birthday and blow the candles out on.
[02:36:31.403 --> 02:36:32.304]  Sheet cake of Donald Trump.
[02:36:32.384 --> 02:36:33.664]  Trump just released a pair of tennis shoes.
[02:36:33.684 --> 02:36:37.606]  It was emblematic of how rebel he is, and I use this analogy a lot, or parallel.
[02:36:38.976 --> 02:36:39.236]  I don't
[02:36:58.764 --> 02:37:10.191]  Coming on board, of course, Johnny Cash, said, screw you, we'll produce music in other states, we'll produce music at our houses, we'll produce music outside Austin, Texas and in Austin, Texas, out at Spicewood and out at Lukenbach, Texas.
[02:37:10.751 --> 02:37:16.214]  And within five years, they were more than half of the entire profit of Nashville.
[02:37:16.355 --> 02:37:20.997]  And at one point, like 80% of it, and it destroyed the monopoly of Nashville.
[02:37:21.017 --> 02:37:21.918]  Well, that was just over
[02:37:22.518 --> 02:37:27.200]  Nashville telling country music people what to sing and what to do and where to go and controlling them.
[02:37:27.220 --> 02:37:28.201]  That really didn't matter.
[02:37:28.241 --> 02:37:29.582]  But ooh, that was outlaw country.
[02:37:29.982 --> 02:37:38.726]  Well, Infowars and Benny Johnson and everybody is, you know, outlaw information, but it really matters for our children and the country and the future of humanity existing.
[02:37:39.146 --> 02:37:45.710]  And then Trump was already the black sheep, avant-garde, cutting edge, what you're not allowed to touch.
[02:37:46.090 --> 02:37:50.392]  And then when they did all these indictments, it really cemented it in people's eyes.
[02:37:50.712 --> 02:37:53.993]  With all the horrible economy and World War III and open borders around it.
[02:37:54.313 --> 02:37:55.013]  And I agree with you.
[02:37:55.994 --> 02:38:00.355]  Before he joked and said, I can shoot somebody on Main Street or Times Square and not get in trouble.
[02:38:00.655 --> 02:38:01.276]  He was joking.
[02:38:01.336 --> 02:38:01.996]  Now he could.
[02:38:02.016 --> 02:38:05.277]  Do you think they realize how they've screwed the pooch and how bad?
[02:38:06.197 --> 02:38:07.358]  You turned him into a gangster.
[02:38:07.998 --> 02:38:09.618]  That's what we heard.
[02:38:09.638 --> 02:38:10.839]  You turned him into a gangster.
[02:38:11.539 --> 02:38:14.460]  Johnny, did the mugshots... Okay, so you just brought up country music, Alex.
[02:38:14.740 --> 02:38:19.982]  Did the mugshot hurt Johnny Cash's career or help Johnny Cash's career as an outlaw country?
[02:38:21.181 --> 02:38:21.821]  It helped it.
[02:38:22.382 --> 02:38:23.462]  Of course, right.
[02:38:24.003 --> 02:38:35.909]  And so what the mugshot really crystallized for so many people, and we go into parts of the country that typically don't get interviews right because they're scared of what people might say, majority black neighborhoods, and we ask people about the mugshot.
[02:38:35.929 --> 02:38:40.912]  We ask people about, we actually have a man on the street coming out just about this exact topic.
[02:38:41.652 --> 02:38:48.016]  And the mugshot, like, proved and crystallized to, I think, maybe hundreds of
[02:38:49.420 --> 02:38:57.887]  That believed there was a rigged system, and that system was rigged against them, and rigged for them to fail, that in fact, that is true.
[02:38:58.607 --> 02:39:00.249]  And that they were right all along.
[02:39:00.789 --> 02:39:12.679]  And if this billionaire, from New York, that has his name blazing on a bunch of buildings, if this guy, the most powerful and biggest celebrity on Earth, can be railroaded by the system, then so can I.
[02:39:14.480 --> 02:39:16.421]  So, by the way, like, like, F you!
[02:39:16.882 --> 02:39:23.506]  Like, like, the system, like, like... And by the way, people, Benny, people, people already felt like that.
[02:39:23.586 --> 02:39:24.807]  They already felt they were railroaded.
[02:39:24.827 --> 02:39:25.247]  They were.
[02:39:25.708 --> 02:39:26.829]  Now they see he's with us.
[02:39:27.671 --> 02:39:29.553]  That's exactly right, and this is what Chris Rock said.
[02:39:29.593 --> 02:39:44.571]  Of all people, to be so clairvoyant on this topic, Chris Rock goes and does a comedy bit at the Kennedy Center in D.C., and he looks at Nancy Pelosi, right at Nancy Pelosi, sitting there on the front row, and he goes, and this was about a year and a half ago, you're gonna lock up Donald Trump?
[02:39:45.051 --> 02:39:46.952]  You're gonna turn him into Tupac!
[02:39:47.372 --> 02:39:48.993]  He's gonna sell more records!
[02:39:49.293 --> 02:39:53.015]  And the entire auditorium, even in Washington, laughs at her!
[02:39:53.395 --> 02:39:54.756]  And laughs at Nancy Pelosi!
[02:39:54.956 --> 02:39:59.198]  And Nancy Pelosi, her little goblins, called up CNN and had that joke cut!
[02:39:59.858 --> 02:40:01.759]  Chris Rock actually was like, that's the funniest joke in the whole thing!
[02:40:01.939 --> 02:40:02.640]  And they cut it!
[02:40:03.340 --> 02:40:07.243]  Because he was calling it exactly, he called it from a thousand yards away.
[02:40:07.524 --> 02:40:15.250]  He's gonna, you're gonna put him in a Tupac, he's gonna sell more records, too big to rig, and the American people have had their champion.
[02:40:15.310 --> 02:40:16.631]  They know that the system is rigged.
[02:40:16.832 --> 02:40:26.280]  Now that everyone knows the systems are rigged, now that the confidence in our federal government is lower than it's ever been, confidence in these systems lower than ever, because they've undone themselves, right?
[02:40:26.300 --> 02:40:27.381]  They've done it to themselves.
[02:40:28.661 --> 02:40:39.147]  And there's the headline for today's show, and I posted a manned-up video on X, Benny Johnson, Trump is too big to rig, or the 2024 election is too big to rig, Trump victorious.
[02:40:39.468 --> 02:40:41.389]  Benny Johnson, how do people find your great show?
[02:40:42.352 --> 02:40:52.917]  Yeah, so if you yourself are a gangster, just like Donald Trump, Tupac, you can go follow us on at Benny Johnson on all, pretty much everywhere.
[02:40:53.077 --> 02:40:55.359]  Pretty much all social media, we're at Benny Johnson.
[02:40:56.439 --> 02:41:11.867]  And Alex, I just want to say, from the bottom of my heart, as somebody who's been watching for a long time, and as somebody who's followed you, you know, and been watching you travel through the fire, very much like your own Trump story, man against the machine, man against the system,
[02:41:12.367 --> 02:41:13.328]  It's just been inspiring.
[02:41:14.008 --> 02:41:22.035]  I think you will go down in history, Alex, as a Breitbart-like figure who, like, inspired people well beyond your years in the truth-telling.
[02:41:22.075 --> 02:41:23.797]  And the truth shall set you free.
[02:41:23.817 --> 02:41:24.577]  We don't want to be slaves.
[02:41:24.677 --> 02:41:25.298]  We want to be free.
[02:41:25.578 --> 02:41:25.979]  Absolutely.
[02:41:25.999 --> 02:41:26.999]  Bennett Johnson, appreciate it.
[02:41:27.019 --> 02:41:27.300]  Take care.
[02:41:27.320 --> 02:41:29.281]  All right.
[02:41:29.441 --> 02:41:34.646]  Now I've got more news to hit before the next guest guest comes in, the great Gerald Cilente here on this Monday edition.
[02:41:35.703 --> 02:41:38.005]  All right, look, here's the bottom line.
[02:41:38.025 --> 02:41:39.626]  We just talked about that with Benny Johnson.
[02:41:40.266 --> 02:41:44.609]  They know they've lost the adults brains and hearts and souls, so they're going for the children.
[02:41:45.329 --> 02:41:54.296]  And there's not just evil, weird, grooming stuff going on in places like New York and Illinois and California and Washington State.
[02:41:54.796 --> 02:41:55.857]  It's going on everywhere.
[02:41:55.877 --> 02:42:03.742]  And I've got videos in Louisiana and Texas and Arkansas and places where you wouldn't expect this to be going on because people are pretty much awake there.
[02:42:04.824 --> 02:42:07.090]  Where they get up and say, we're going to groom your children.
[02:42:07.371 --> 02:42:08.634]  We're going to teach them to be homosexuals.
[02:42:08.655 --> 02:42:09.798]  We're going to teach them to be pedophiles.
[02:42:10.652 --> 02:42:11.612]  I can show you hours of this.
[02:42:11.632 --> 02:42:12.492]  You've seen it.
[02:42:12.512 --> 02:42:16.013]  The San Francisco choir saying, we're coming for your kids, we're going to groom them.
[02:42:16.073 --> 02:42:19.894]  But this latest footage came out over the weekend, went super viral.
[02:42:20.694 --> 02:42:27.655]  Deer Creek School District, public school in Oklahoma, and it's children sucking and licking the feet.
[02:42:27.675 --> 02:42:28.996]  And they go, oh, it's other children.
[02:42:29.556 --> 02:42:30.816]  No, it's not, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:42:30.836 --> 02:42:31.636]  We have the raw footage.
[02:42:31.656 --> 02:42:32.857]  We're not going to show little kids' faces.
[02:42:33.317 --> 02:42:34.357]  But these are adults.
[02:42:35.157 --> 02:42:36.598]  That have made big donations.
[02:42:36.658 --> 02:42:40.739]  They all raised $150,000 to have children lick and suck their feet.
[02:42:40.779 --> 02:42:41.940]  It's unsanitary.
[02:42:41.980 --> 02:42:42.760]  It's disgusting.
[02:42:43.180 --> 02:42:43.921]  It's degrading.
[02:42:44.001 --> 02:42:45.341]  And the parents said they weren't told.
[02:42:45.701 --> 02:42:47.522]  The parents shot multiple videos of it.
[02:42:48.643 --> 02:42:51.164]  And at first the school district said, oh, we don't authorize this.
[02:42:52.864 --> 02:42:54.025]  Now they're defending it.
[02:42:55.705 --> 02:42:58.727]  So it seems like there's no level they won't sink to.
[02:42:59.327 --> 02:43:01.228]  It's like Chase Geiser said on his ex-account.
[02:43:01.868 --> 02:43:03.609]  If he found out that one of his kids
[02:43:04.625 --> 02:43:07.067]  was sucking people's feet for money.
[02:43:07.467 --> 02:43:08.648]  He'd be in an orange jumpsuit.
[02:43:09.709 --> 02:43:10.069]  Okay?
[02:43:10.210 --> 02:43:11.330]  It's on Fox News.
[02:43:11.511 --> 02:43:12.191]  They're locally.
[02:43:12.211 --> 02:43:13.993]  And these, again, look at those.
[02:43:14.033 --> 02:43:16.755]  Those are adults having their feet sucked, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:43:17.415 --> 02:43:22.780]  And those are middle school students and elementary school students sucking and licking their feet.
[02:43:22.820 --> 02:43:23.781]  This is degrading.
[02:43:24.161 --> 02:43:25.322]  This is mind control.
[02:43:25.702 --> 02:43:26.983]  This is what the left wants to do.
[02:43:27.624 --> 02:43:28.665]  Here's a breakdown of it.
[02:43:36.061 --> 02:43:45.426]  Breaking news, we have just confirmed that a registered child sex offender has been reading to children at a Houston Public Library as part of its Drag Queen Story Hour.
[02:43:47.307 --> 02:43:49.988]  This is going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[02:43:50.108 --> 02:43:52.689]  Most people seem to walk away having a good time.
[02:43:52.809 --> 02:43:53.830]  A stardom young, right?
[02:43:53.910 --> 02:43:55.411]  A stardom young, right?
[02:43:58.524 --> 02:44:05.369]  We are grooming the new generation of Americans to be fully embracing of diversity and inclusivity.
[02:44:05.529 --> 02:44:08.151]  This is gonna be the grooming of the next generation.
[02:44:08.411 --> 02:44:13.755]  That's the whole goal, is to make kids that aren't used to seeing something like me more comfortable to seeing it.
[02:44:13.995 --> 02:44:15.677]  You could be a drag queen superhero!
[02:44:15.777 --> 02:44:16.457]  And shake your butts!
[02:44:16.477 --> 02:44:17.738]  Shake em, shake em, shake em, shake em, shake em!
[02:44:17.818 --> 02:44:22.902]  And we witnessed parents taking their children as young as two inside to take part.
[02:44:22.922 --> 02:44:24.023]  That's stardom young, right?
[02:44:24.063 --> 02:44:25.584]  That's stardom young, right?
[02:44:29.355 --> 02:44:35.236]  One of those drag queens, Tatiana Malanina, is really Alberto Garza, a child sex offender.
[02:44:35.676 --> 02:44:37.117]  We can both be grooms.
[02:44:37.237 --> 02:44:40.317]  To an audience of preschoolers, toddlers, and their caregivers.
[02:44:40.457 --> 02:44:44.698]  Family programming!
[02:44:44.938 --> 02:44:47.479]  We'll convert your children.
[02:44:48.139 --> 02:44:50.600]  Someone's gotta teach them not to hate.
[02:44:55.316 --> 02:44:58.507]  We're coming for your channel!
[02:45:11.609 --> 02:45:16.253]  Your children will care about fairness and justice for others.
[02:45:16.353 --> 02:45:21.478]  Your children will work to convert all your sisters and brothers.
[02:45:21.799 --> 02:45:30.107]  Then soon we're almost certain, your kids will start converting.
[02:45:42.284 --> 02:45:43.405]  That's stardom young, right?
[02:45:43.425 --> 02:45:51.069]  That's stardom young, right?
[02:45:51.109 --> 02:45:53.351]  Children are the ultimate currency of the future.
[02:45:54.351 --> 02:45:57.193]  That's why evil's taking them on.
[02:45:57.233 --> 02:46:02.456]  Children literally... ...sucking the feet.
[02:46:03.537 --> 02:46:05.658]  Cramming the toes all the way in.
[02:46:05.798 --> 02:46:09.861]  Basically, deep-throating their teacher's feet.
[02:46:11.129 --> 02:46:12.130]  Serious child abuse.
[02:46:12.210 --> 02:46:13.811]  And now the school's trying to cover it up.
[02:46:14.331 --> 02:46:15.112]  We have the footage.
[02:46:15.692 --> 02:46:16.933]  This is beyond disgusting.
[02:46:17.434 --> 02:46:19.115]  But it's meant to sear your conscience.
[02:46:19.135 --> 02:46:19.595]  Remember what?
[02:46:20.116 --> 02:46:26.240]  Bill Clinton's nominee for Surgeon General, Jocelyn Elders, 1993.
[02:46:28.442 --> 02:46:29.722]  And they have expunged the clip.
[02:46:29.782 --> 02:46:30.623]  No one can find it.
[02:46:30.663 --> 02:46:31.523]  Limbaugh used to play it.
[02:46:31.963 --> 02:46:42.806]  She testified and admitted she did it in Congress, but it was not the quote of, we have to get past this societal issue with reaching down and masturbating to children.
[02:46:42.866 --> 02:46:44.606]  Reach down and do it to the babies.
[02:46:44.646 --> 02:46:48.127]  We have the congressional clip where she admits she did that.
[02:46:48.907 --> 02:46:51.428]  They want to molest your children.
[02:46:53.108 --> 02:46:54.288]  It's a pedophile cult.
[02:46:54.949 --> 02:46:56.429]  And they're paying big money for this.
[02:46:58.302 --> 02:47:10.554]  So they paid $150,000 plus to have a whole bunch of children cram disgusting dirty feet in their mouths and suck their feet like they were a 50-year-old veteran prostitute.
[02:47:12.675 --> 02:47:15.678]  Because none of the other thrills will get them where they wanted to be.
[02:47:16.639 --> 02:47:18.341]  Now they want a child to suck their feet.
[02:47:20.649 --> 02:47:21.409]  And it gets worse.
[02:47:21.930 --> 02:47:23.231]  I've got the newscast on this.
[02:47:23.531 --> 02:47:28.714]  Kentucky Democrat says child sex dolls could protect kids from pedophiles.
[02:47:29.314 --> 02:47:30.495]  Give them a release.
[02:47:32.256 --> 02:47:36.678]  We've got companies now selling babies, doll babies you rape.
[02:47:37.359 --> 02:47:39.020]  And it's all being defended.
[02:47:40.020 --> 02:47:41.021]  And it just goes on and on.
[02:47:41.061 --> 02:47:42.002]  Kentucky State Senator
[02:47:43.568 --> 02:47:49.793]  Child sex tolls can prevent offenses, and now they're also having blow-up German shepherds you have sex with.
[02:47:50.333 --> 02:47:53.555]  Student toe-licking fundraiser sparks investigation at Oklahoma School.
[02:47:53.575 --> 02:47:55.457]  See, they're meant to just get you used to this.
[02:47:56.517 --> 02:47:58.899]  Disturbing video shows teens sucking, licking feet.
[02:47:58.919 --> 02:47:59.640]  They're younger than that.
[02:48:00.140 --> 02:48:04.003]  Each other's toes at school-sanctioned event as agency investigates.
[02:48:04.663 --> 02:48:08.066]  Oklahoma School doesn't respond to a video showing students licking toes at fundraiser.
[02:48:08.888 --> 02:48:11.490]  Video footlicking at Oklahoma school sparks anger.
[02:48:12.251 --> 02:48:14.012]  They're marking their territory, folks.
[02:48:15.033 --> 02:48:16.314]  And I've got the articles right here.
[02:48:16.374 --> 02:48:17.936]  How dare the parents be outraged?
[02:48:17.976 --> 02:48:19.257]  On the left saying, how dare them?
[02:48:19.557 --> 02:48:21.559]  People are making mean phone calls to the charity.
[02:48:22.219 --> 02:48:23.080]  High school scandal.
[02:48:23.100 --> 02:48:24.761]  Students lick and kiss each other's feet.
[02:48:24.821 --> 02:48:26.042]  Not each other's, everybody's.
[02:48:27.143 --> 02:48:31.287]  Not your average Joe non-profit harassed over viral Deer Creek video.
[02:48:32.745 --> 02:48:33.587]  Yes, they're the victims.
[02:48:33.727 --> 02:48:34.989]  Somewhere I've got the articles here.
[02:48:35.410 --> 02:48:36.532]  Discrimination is good.
[02:48:36.612 --> 02:48:38.255]  Without it, civilization would collapse.
[02:48:38.735 --> 02:48:39.897]  Infowars.com.
[02:48:41.540 --> 02:48:44.065]  Yeah, we don't discriminate on what color you are.
[02:48:44.085 --> 02:48:45.087]  I agree with Martin Luther King.
[02:48:46.260 --> 02:48:49.102]  But you discriminate on a restaurant you get food poisoning from.
[02:48:49.482 --> 02:48:53.724]  You discriminate on a bank that gives you bad service and grabs your money and doesn't give it to you.
[02:48:53.744 --> 02:48:58.487]  You discriminate against a neighbor you catch robbing your garage or beating your kid up.
[02:48:58.507 --> 02:48:59.867]  I don't care what color they are.
[02:49:00.468 --> 02:49:03.609]  You discriminate off what rifle shoots better or what ammunition is better.
[02:49:03.930 --> 02:49:05.931]  You discriminate off what steak tastes better.
[02:49:06.691 --> 02:49:08.672]  You discriminate off a red light.
[02:49:08.692 --> 02:49:09.973]  I'm going to discriminate.
[02:49:10.013 --> 02:49:11.093]  I'm going to stop at a red light.
[02:49:11.113 --> 02:49:12.134]  I'm going to drive at a green light.
[02:49:12.714 --> 02:49:13.815]  I'm going to slow down at a yellow light.
[02:49:14.495 --> 02:49:15.616]  Everything is discrimination.
[02:49:16.564 --> 02:49:17.425]  Discrimination's good.
[02:49:17.465 --> 02:49:18.946]  Without it, civilization would collapse.
[02:49:18.986 --> 02:49:21.048]  Key article, InfoWars.com.
[02:49:21.088 --> 02:49:21.448]  Here it is.
[02:49:21.468 --> 02:49:32.478]  A company that offers custom childlike sex dolls now promotes bestiality and offers dog sex dolls for zoophiles.
[02:49:32.638 --> 02:49:33.679]  You learn something new every day.
[02:49:34.619 --> 02:49:40.404]  And listen, the head of the Young Turks said if he was world dictator, he would legalize pleasuring animals.
[02:49:40.465 --> 02:49:41.425]  He gets all excited.
[02:49:42.006 --> 02:49:44.108]  Bubs, these people mean business.
[02:49:45.387 --> 02:49:49.488]  And they are coming after everybody, everywhere, every day.
[02:49:49.748 --> 02:49:50.808]  They want to dominate us.
[02:49:50.868 --> 02:49:52.389]  And what is most precious?
[02:49:52.609 --> 02:49:54.349]  It is our children.
[02:49:55.290 --> 02:49:56.510]  TV viewers will be able to see this.
[02:49:56.570 --> 02:49:58.070]  Radio listeners will try to describe it to you.
[02:49:58.090 --> 02:50:02.492]  But this is something Elon Musk put out on X months ago, but I came across it today.
[02:50:03.052 --> 02:50:05.653]  And it shows a spectrum of blue on the left, red on the right.
[02:50:06.553 --> 02:50:07.513]  This is the year 2008.
[02:50:08.693 --> 02:50:10.874]  And the guy that's me is a little bit over to the left.
[02:50:10.934 --> 02:50:12.674]  And you've got the fellow liberal over there.
[02:50:13.115 --> 02:50:14.235]  You've got the conservative over here.
[02:50:15.166 --> 02:50:23.890]  2012, the left runs completely far to the left, and Satanism, and pedophilia, and open borders, and World War III, and forced injections, and world government.
[02:50:25.831 --> 02:50:27.492]  And so, it moves the original winner to the left.
[02:50:27.552 --> 02:50:31.454]  Well, now, suddenly, the person who was in the center is more of a right-winger.
[02:50:32.274 --> 02:50:34.995]  And that's where we are today.
[02:50:35.015 --> 02:50:41.118]  But we've got to get past this, because the neocons, a lot of Republican leadership, like Mitch McConnell, they're just as bad as the Democrats.
[02:50:41.138 --> 02:50:42.039]  Notice Mitch McConnell's
[02:50:43.081 --> 02:50:46.084]  Sister-in-law was a billionaire and all hooked in with the Chi-Coms.
[02:50:46.825 --> 02:50:49.728]  It's now a criminal investigation outside Austin in Johnson City.
[02:50:50.308 --> 02:50:53.371]  It's very suspicious she ended up dead in a car in a pond.
[02:50:54.472 --> 02:50:57.615]  And Mitch McConnell resigns the day her body's found.
[02:50:58.917 --> 02:51:06.164]  Who the hell knows what's really going on there, but you're seeing the death of
[02:51:07.492 --> 02:51:11.834]  Charlie Munger, and the death of Henry Kissinger, and the death of Lord Rothschild.
[02:51:11.854 --> 02:51:17.996]  The old establishment is symbolically going away right now.
[02:51:18.056 --> 02:51:22.717]  And look at Mitch McConnell's sister-in-law's billionaire globalist husband.
[02:51:22.737 --> 02:51:28.059]  I mean, look at that fake Brian Stelter-esque smile.
[02:51:29.860 --> 02:51:32.501]  You get around these people, and I've been around some of them, that's exactly who they are.
[02:51:32.521 --> 02:51:36.102]  They are like automatons, evil robbing robots.
[02:51:38.479 --> 02:51:44.041]  E-R-R's.
[02:51:45.922 --> 02:51:47.162]  Evil Robbing Robots.
[02:51:48.783 --> 02:51:51.284]  Continuing here, how's things going for Google?
[02:51:52.404 --> 02:51:58.827]  I said a few weeks ago, when it broke two weeks ago, the Gemini AI program erasing white people from reality.
[02:51:58.887 --> 02:52:00.327]  Black people didn't do that, don't blame them.
[02:52:00.387 --> 02:52:06.870]  It's the AI, Google, CIA Global is trying to create division and total distrust of the system.
[02:52:08.188 --> 02:52:12.252]  Google's now lost over $70 billion in stock.
[02:52:13.413 --> 02:52:18.618]  Google parent company Alphabet plummets $70 billion after Gemini AI scandal.
[02:52:18.658 --> 02:52:22.961]  Washington Post, Fox Business, they're all reporting it.
[02:52:24.383 --> 02:52:28.767]  House GOP probing if Biden administration colluded to make Google's AI woke.
[02:52:30.239 --> 02:52:31.399]  And historically accurate.
[02:52:31.459 --> 02:52:32.960]  That's all they do.
[02:52:33.100 --> 02:52:35.160]  And again, it's not to help black people.
[02:52:35.660 --> 02:52:41.562]  If you can teach people that two men can have a baby and that George Washington was black, it doesn't help black people do that.
[02:52:41.942 --> 02:52:43.622]  It makes white people freak out.
[02:52:44.022 --> 02:52:45.123]  And black people freak out.
[02:52:45.143 --> 02:52:46.963]  It creates division.
[02:52:47.583 --> 02:52:49.544]  It creates destabilization.
[02:52:50.684 --> 02:52:52.064]  That is the plan.
[02:52:52.564 --> 02:52:53.985]  That is the program.
[02:52:55.005 --> 02:52:58.426]  And then we've got another program that the UN and Bill Gates has been pioneering.
[02:52:59.735 --> 02:53:01.036]  This is from Fox News.
[02:53:01.697 --> 02:53:03.538]  Think about what you flushed today.
[02:53:04.579 --> 02:53:07.561]  Advocates raise alarm over human or fertilizers.
[02:53:09.083 --> 02:53:16.269]  First legalized a decade ago in Washington State, now legalized in over 26 states, the number I saw last week.
[02:53:17.690 --> 02:53:20.612]  When someone dies, you don't burn them, you don't bury them.
[02:53:21.093 --> 02:53:28.138]  You dissolve them and then put it into fertilizer and they take human waste and put it on the crops.
[02:53:29.158 --> 02:53:32.181]  Without even microwaving it or cleaning it up.
[02:53:33.782 --> 02:53:35.343]  And that's not what's important though.
[02:53:36.324 --> 02:53:38.126]  Not just the diseases, the hepatitis, all of it.
[02:53:39.026 --> 02:53:40.588]  No, it's what people are eating.
[02:53:41.088 --> 02:53:50.456]  All of those bio-accumulated Prozacs and Ritalins and Adderalls and chemotherapy and all of what's bio-accumulated in a human.
[02:53:50.476 --> 02:53:53.338]  That's why you eat a big tuna, you get really sick because it's a big fish.
[02:53:53.358 --> 02:53:54.219]  You eat a lot of little fish.
[02:53:55.260 --> 02:53:57.422]  You bio-accumulate all of that.
[02:54:00.089 --> 02:54:11.238]  And now you're eating it, and they admit in the studies that if you think the water supply is toxic, imagine human feces concentrated and sprayed on your food.
[02:54:11.378 --> 02:54:23.668]  While Bill Gates pioneers that, all over the world they're banning cow manure, and horse manure, and chicken manure, and pig manure, and turkey manure, and duck manure that they've got tons of to put on crops.
[02:54:25.329 --> 02:54:28.972]  They're trying to ban that, saying it's not good for the Earth.
[02:54:30.640 --> 02:54:32.501]  Because cows fart and pigs fart.
[02:54:33.402 --> 02:54:34.982]  Well, that's part of the atmosphere, methane.
[02:54:35.523 --> 02:54:40.466]  So don't worry, we'll get the human feces and we'll put it on your food.
[02:54:41.986 --> 02:54:43.227]  They don't want you to eat the bugs.
[02:54:44.168 --> 02:54:45.308]  They want you to eat shit.
[02:54:46.449 --> 02:54:56.795]  And if you look it up again, Bill Gates said again a decade ago, and now he's doing it, California and LA has it in place, toilet to tap, where they take the sewage water
[02:54:57.745 --> 02:55:00.387]  With all the chemicals and all the garbage.
[02:55:01.128 --> 02:55:02.128]  By the way, great job, crew.
[02:55:02.148 --> 02:55:02.909]  They know I was going to say that.
[02:55:02.929 --> 02:55:04.070]  They pulled that up in five seconds.
[02:55:04.090 --> 02:55:04.630]  That's incredible.
[02:55:06.372 --> 02:55:08.233]  For your TV viewer, yeah, there's Gates notes.
[02:55:08.513 --> 02:55:09.254]  Oh, Bill Gates.
[02:55:10.074 --> 02:55:11.135]  He goes, oh, it's delicious.
[02:55:11.175 --> 02:55:11.896]  It's out of the sewage.
[02:55:11.916 --> 02:55:12.476]  And he drinks it.
[02:55:12.796 --> 02:55:14.418]  And he makes money off of that.
[02:55:15.038 --> 02:55:15.939]  They want to degrade you.
[02:55:15.979 --> 02:55:17.320]  Your children will suck the toes.
[02:55:17.560 --> 02:55:19.121]  Your children will go visit pedophiles.
[02:55:19.381 --> 02:55:20.682]  Your children will be put on these drugs.
[02:55:20.923 --> 02:55:22.164]  Your children will be sterilized.
[02:55:22.984 --> 02:55:24.144]  Your children will drink sewage.
[02:55:24.384 --> 02:55:30.686]  And where in Europe and Canada and the U.S., where's the first places we're finding the cricket meal?
[02:55:30.726 --> 02:55:31.586]  That's the number one thing.
[02:55:31.646 --> 02:55:32.287]  And mealworms.
[02:55:32.447 --> 02:55:32.867]  Two big things.
[02:55:33.207 --> 02:55:34.767]  Crickets and mealworms.
[02:55:36.448 --> 02:55:37.908]  Full of chitin, full of toxins.
[02:55:38.068 --> 02:55:39.388]  On record, look up chitin.
[02:55:39.488 --> 02:55:41.029]  Bug skeletons cause cancer.
[02:55:41.789 --> 02:55:43.730]  Absolutely cause arthritis, you name it.
[02:55:43.790 --> 02:55:44.470]  Just horrible.
[02:55:46.070 --> 02:55:48.331]  In the U.S., all over the country,
[02:55:49.141 --> 02:55:51.062]  You think your child's getting a chicken fried steak at lunch?
[02:55:51.682 --> 02:55:54.703]  The protein batter is mainly cricket and mealworm.
[02:55:56.163 --> 02:55:57.124]  And it's already on store shelves.
[02:55:58.544 --> 02:56:06.547]  And Tyson announced last year, along with 20-plus big producers, that they're moving into bug protein and building the factories everywhere.
[02:56:06.987 --> 02:56:09.888]  But to make you do that, they've got to sabotage beef.
[02:56:10.428 --> 02:56:16.130]  So now Leticia James has filed suit against the biggest meatpacker, and she's pledged to put them out of business!
[02:56:17.930 --> 02:56:20.452]  They're gonna come out to the grocery stores and the restaurants.
[02:56:21.192 --> 02:56:28.057]  Europe, 15 years ago, banned, in most areas, space heaters and fireplaces and gas ranges.
[02:56:28.318 --> 02:56:30.459]  He said, that'll never happen here when I put it in Obama Deception.
[02:56:30.779 --> 02:56:35.363]  I show you in Obama Deception, 14 years ago, whenever that came out, right when he first got elected, 2009.
[02:56:35.623 --> 02:56:37.665]  Yeah, I guess that's 14 years ago.
[02:56:40.266 --> 02:56:44.570]  And I show you the documents and where they said, oh, that's ridiculous, they'll never ban it.
[02:56:45.030 --> 02:56:45.991]  Range stoves.
[02:56:47.276 --> 02:56:48.077]  Is it happening?
[02:56:48.717 --> 02:56:49.518]  Is it happening?
[02:56:50.018 --> 02:56:50.639]  Is it happening?
[02:56:50.659 --> 02:56:55.463]  Yes, CNN, Tyson Foods, one of the biggest meat producers, is investing in insect protein.
[02:56:56.704 --> 02:56:58.685]  All right, the great Gerald Celente takes over.
[02:56:58.766 --> 02:56:59.726]  Please support us.

[02:57:13.035 --> 02:57:16.637]  Next little foundational energy is about to sell out, but it's not a stimulant.
[02:57:16.677 --> 02:57:18.058]  No, it's the energy of the cells.
[02:57:18.118 --> 02:57:18.998]  Different level energy.
[02:57:19.299 --> 02:57:20.159]  That's why it's next level.
[02:57:20.539 --> 02:57:22.420]  That's why TurboForce is 10-hour clean energy.
[02:57:22.460 --> 02:57:25.282]  It is a bunch of stimulants that are natural and good, with a good letdown.
[02:57:26.002 --> 02:57:26.423]  Amazing.
[02:57:26.783 --> 02:57:27.663]  TurboForce.
[02:57:27.703 --> 02:57:30.405]  Next little foundational energy to clean out your blood.
[02:57:30.585 --> 02:57:32.606]  Everybody should be on now.

[02:57:35.388 --> 02:57:37.929]  InfoWarStore.com.
[02:57:38.049 --> 02:57:38.730]  NitricBoost.

[02:58:01.291 --> 02:58:05.035]  Plus, you really need Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, 95% curcuminoid.
[02:58:05.595 --> 02:58:08.438]  The strongest other top brands are 75-80%.
[02:58:08.719 --> 02:58:09.399]  Nobody makes it 95.
[02:58:09.520 --> 02:58:11.742]  We went to the top, one of the top makers.
[02:58:11.782 --> 02:58:12.983]  We said, we want the strongest you can make.
[02:58:13.303 --> 02:58:15.225]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, 40% off.
[02:58:15.606 --> 02:58:16.667]  Infowarstore.com.

[02:58:19.549 --> 02:58:21.110]  We've been selling Nitric Boost for a couple of years.
[02:58:21.130 --> 02:58:24.290]  Never had it below $25 because there was hardly any profit there.
[02:58:24.350 --> 02:58:27.251]  We went to a place that gives us stuff just as good or even better.
[02:58:27.271 --> 02:58:28.191]  That's where we're getting it from.
[02:58:28.751 --> 02:58:31.532]  And it's 40% off, passing the savings on to you.
[02:58:32.132 --> 02:58:32.692]  Nitric Boost.

[02:58:33.552 --> 02:58:34.032]  You need to take it.

[02:58:48.160 --> 02:58:53.881]  I'm not perfect and I'm under a lot of stress, but if I didn't have the supplements we have, we promote, I wouldn't be able to continue to be on air.
[02:58:54.481 --> 02:59:02.582]  And when you go to InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists in an operation that the enemy admits has been the most effective at exposing them.

[02:59:04.743 --> 02:59:05.743]  We got God on our side.
[02:59:06.023 --> 02:59:07.523]  But God needs to work through you.
[02:59:07.883 --> 02:59:11.884]  You've got to make the decision to get great products you already need at InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:59:13.764 --> 02:59:16.745]  Nitric Boost, without even knowing, became our number three bestseller.
[02:59:17.425 --> 02:59:19.027]  Because people loved it so much.
[02:59:19.047 --> 02:59:19.988]  It had such great effects.
[02:59:20.289 --> 02:59:26.476]  Got all these natural compounds that clean out the blood, open up your arteries and veins, the capillators, clean out your heart, your brain, everything.
[02:59:27.277 --> 02:59:28.999]  Well, we got an even better manufacturer.
[02:59:29.019 --> 02:59:33.864]  The other one was great, but one that's even better with even higher quality ingredients at a lower price.
[02:59:34.805 --> 02:59:37.749]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:09.842 --> 03:00:11.444]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:00:11.764 --> 03:00:27.557]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilente.
[03:00:28.017 --> 03:00:34.282]  I'm up here in Kingston, New York, where the seeds of democracy was sown.
[03:00:34.342 --> 03:00:36.424]  This was the first capital of New York State.
[03:00:37.534 --> 03:00:40.336]  The British burnt it down after the Battle of Saratoga.
[03:00:41.877 --> 03:00:49.222]  But the Constitution that was written for New York State, over 70% of America's Constitution comes from the Constitution that was written.
[03:00:50.323 --> 03:00:52.484]  The seeds of democracy was sown here.
[03:00:53.685 --> 03:01:01.610]  And that's why I bought three of the most historic buildings in America, the only place with pre-Revolutionary War stone buildings on each corner.
[03:01:03.291 --> 03:01:03.932]  As I say,
[03:01:04.639 --> 03:01:07.860]  I'm only me because I'm a Napolitano born in the Bronx.
[03:01:07.880 --> 03:01:09.400]  I want to be free.
[03:01:09.420 --> 03:01:14.022]  If I was born in Ottawilla, Pino, Vicoquens, that wouldn't be me.
[03:01:15.202 --> 03:01:16.462]  So I fight for freedom.
[03:01:16.502 --> 03:01:18.323]  I'm a warrior for the Prince of Peace.
[03:01:20.243 --> 03:01:22.364]  And what's going on now breaks my heart.
[03:01:23.344 --> 03:01:27.646]  And I have peace rallies here, so they're going on a long time.
[03:01:27.666 --> 03:01:30.766]  And as I said, I'm against America's wars.
[03:01:30.826 --> 03:01:32.687]  Don't call me anti-American.
[03:01:33.504 --> 03:01:34.984]  I'm against Israel's wars.
[03:01:35.024 --> 03:01:38.345]  Don't call me anti-Semite.
[03:01:38.425 --> 03:01:38.845]  Save it.
[03:01:40.225 --> 03:01:43.346]  You know, on American currency it says, in God we trust.
[03:01:43.386 --> 03:01:44.586]  What God are you talking about?
[03:01:45.747 --> 03:01:55.288]  What God trusts stealing all our trillions and trillions and countless trillions of dollars to support the war machine?
[03:01:57.049 --> 03:01:57.649]  What God?
[03:02:00.630 --> 03:02:02.730]  As the country rots in front of your eye,
[03:02:04.614 --> 03:02:15.440]  Where are the presidential candidates saying, which is the foundation of Occupy Peace, close the over 800 bases overseas?
[03:02:18.481 --> 03:02:21.243]  What, in some 70, 80, 90 countries?
[03:02:22.224 --> 03:02:23.324]  What are we doing over there?
[03:02:25.345 --> 03:02:27.546]  And bring the troops here to secure the homeland.
[03:02:30.548 --> 03:02:32.209]  And instead of spending that money
[03:02:32.972 --> 03:02:35.413]  To give to your Lloyd Austin gang?
[03:02:36.333 --> 03:02:36.794]  Oh yeah.
[03:02:37.454 --> 03:02:40.635]  Oh yeah, the arrogant, arrogant Lloyd Austin.
[03:02:42.376 --> 03:02:44.196]  Oh, he's our defense secretary.
[03:02:44.496 --> 03:02:48.518]  You mean the guy that murdered people over there in Iraq and Afghanistan?
[03:02:50.839 --> 03:02:53.660]  And sat on the board of directors of Raytheon?
[03:02:54.260 --> 03:02:56.801]  The second largest defense contractor?
[03:02:57.942 --> 03:02:58.642]  In America?
[03:03:01.334 --> 03:03:20.949]  Who says that people like me, who don't want to get involved in these foreign entanglements, and honor 1776, George Washington, farewell address, telling the American people not to get involved in these foreign entanglements.
[03:03:21.329 --> 03:03:23.791]  Basically, this crap's been going on for centuries.
[03:03:25.112 --> 03:03:30.056]  And don't love a nation or hate a nation, because if you have either one, you're going to become a slave to a nation.
[03:03:30.723 --> 03:03:41.545]  So he calls that little arrogant, arrogant, arrogant, arrogant murderer of the first degree, people like me, isolationists.
[03:03:42.826 --> 03:03:46.066]  Save that crappy line and shove it!
[03:03:49.807 --> 03:03:55.828]  I don't, none of my business what goes on between Taiwan and China.
[03:03:56.168 --> 03:03:58.869]  Only been going on since the Ming Dynasty.
[03:04:01.474 --> 03:04:03.375]  Oh, and you're going to solve it?
[03:04:03.916 --> 03:04:04.716]  Lloyd Austin?
[03:04:04.877 --> 03:04:07.578]  Hey, how about that arrogant Betrayed Us?
[03:04:07.999 --> 03:04:09.200]  Oh, no, Betray Us.
[03:04:10.200 --> 03:04:10.480]  Oh, yeah.
[03:04:10.521 --> 03:04:11.361]  What is he on some?
[03:04:11.761 --> 03:04:14.904]  Oh, he got like some rich job now, a former general.
[03:04:15.664 --> 03:04:26.352]  When the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner Barack Obama has a troop surge in Afghanistan and the crap, the crap spewing out of Betrayed Us mouth.
[03:04:27.272 --> 03:04:28.753]  How successful we're going to be?
[03:04:28.773 --> 03:04:30.915]  Who are you talking to?
[03:04:31.627 --> 03:04:33.268]  And you're going to win, beat China?
[03:04:33.288 --> 03:04:35.449]  You haven't won a war since World War II.
[03:04:35.869 --> 03:04:38.090]  Oh, by the way, the Russians helped us win that one.
[03:04:39.551 --> 03:04:48.015]  So when we come back, we're going to talk about what's going on with gold, Bitcoin, and get ready for the banking bust.
[03:04:49.355 --> 03:04:51.876]  The worst financial crisis in modern history.
[03:04:52.457 --> 03:04:52.957]  Stay tuned.
[03:04:58.248 --> 03:05:07.778]  Unless you've been living under a rock, you've heard how amazing turmeric is for inflammation for your joints, your bones, your blood, your organs, your mind, everything.
[03:05:08.238 --> 03:05:11.742]  Well, we have Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula with 95% curcuminoid extract.
[03:05:13.403 --> 03:05:15.884]  No one that we know of has it even above 85%.
[03:05:15.924 --> 03:05:24.549]  This is the strongest formula on the market, and it's way lower priced than some of the top brands out there that are 75%, 80% human oil.
[03:05:25.029 --> 03:05:27.811]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is amazing.
[03:05:28.071 --> 03:05:29.311]  You're missing out if you don't try it.
[03:05:29.612 --> 03:05:35.195]  It's discounted right now, 40% off at InfoWareStore.com, and it funds the InfoWare, a total 360 win.
[03:05:35.435 --> 03:05:37.276]  You owe it to yourself to try Body's.
[03:05:37.556 --> 03:05:38.396]  I know you'll be amazed.
[03:05:38.676 --> 03:05:39.657]  Get yours right now.
[03:05:39.957 --> 03:05:40.518]  That's right.
[03:06:08.692 --> 03:06:11.574]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:06:12.074 --> 03:06:15.877]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente!
[03:06:16.797 --> 03:06:29.025]  It's great to be on The Alex Jones Show, and remember, do all you can to support InfoWars, because InfoWars is doing everything they can to support you.
[03:06:29.765 --> 03:06:35.229]  The team works tirelessly, as does Alex Jones, and they're giving you a lot of great information,
[03:06:35.899 --> 03:06:37.780]  It's very hard to find anywhere else.
[03:06:38.120 --> 03:06:42.042]  We go there every day to see what InfoWars News is putting out.
[03:06:43.223 --> 03:06:45.844]  And so, again, this is a time of censorship.
[03:06:46.464 --> 03:06:52.587]  I'm looking at some back articles over here of the stupidity of censorship.
[03:06:53.488 --> 03:06:54.288]  I just found one.
[03:06:54.328 --> 03:06:54.968]  Where is it here?
[03:06:54.988 --> 03:06:56.349]  It's very funny to look at.
[03:06:56.369 --> 03:06:58.290]  Here we go.
[03:07:01.957 --> 03:07:06.520]  New York limits social gatherings as virus surges across the U.S.
[03:07:08.261 --> 03:07:12.103]  Indoor gatherings and private residence must be limited to 10 people.
[03:07:12.843 --> 03:07:17.146]  Why, you lousy S.O.B., I say 11 people!
[03:07:17.786 --> 03:07:19.147]  What's wrong with you, Salenki?
[03:07:19.187 --> 03:07:20.488]  That's misinformation.
[03:07:20.908 --> 03:07:23.109]  It shows exactly 10 people.
[03:07:23.509 --> 03:07:24.930]  Why, I say 9 people.
[03:07:25.471 --> 03:07:27.332]  Eight and a half people!
[03:07:28.112 --> 03:07:29.373]  This is the crap!
[03:07:30.538 --> 03:07:38.403]  This is the crap that they spew out that the mainstream media reports as though it's facts.
[03:07:39.844 --> 03:07:45.548]  F-A-C, you know, I think there's spelling where it says F-U-C, yeah, that's what it is.
[03:07:46.368 --> 03:07:47.209]  Facts, you.
[03:07:48.830 --> 03:07:55.014]  So what you're getting from InfoWars, what you're getting with your Trends Journal, again, we're going to talk about gold and Bitcoin.
[03:07:56.388 --> 03:07:57.749]  And we nail this thing.
[03:07:58.089 --> 03:08:00.972]  Oh, one of our top trends for 2024.
[03:08:01.792 --> 03:08:02.873]  Golden year for gold.
[03:08:02.893 --> 03:08:03.514]  Huh.
[03:08:03.934 --> 03:08:05.795]  What's it selling now at $2,113.14 an ounce?
[03:08:05.815 --> 03:08:06.176]  Oh, in Bitcoin?
[03:08:10.839 --> 03:08:14.200]  Where we call the bottom and we said we're going to take off again.
[03:08:14.220 --> 03:08:14.260]  Oh, 67,000.
[03:08:14.740 --> 03:08:16.061]  Oh, no.
[03:08:16.821 --> 03:08:18.841]  But go to the Cartoon News Network.
[03:08:19.222 --> 03:08:32.726]  And remember, during the covid war, you stand six feet apart and we're going to cut little circles everywhere because the wind blows exactly in straight lines in six feet.
[03:08:32.886 --> 03:08:34.946]  Does it go up, down, around, over and out?
[03:08:35.247 --> 03:08:36.427]  Oh, put those little stupid
[03:08:37.498 --> 03:08:44.901]  Plexiglass things in front of the cash register people because the wind doesn't go under it, doesn't go around it, and doesn't come from behind it.
[03:08:47.182 --> 03:08:50.544]  So what I'm saying is, you need to support the truth.
[03:08:51.524 --> 03:08:53.885]  They call the truth misinformation.
[03:08:55.786 --> 03:08:59.627]  As I said, I find that sexist calling it misinformation.
[03:09:01.248 --> 03:09:02.088]  Gender information.
[03:09:02.669 --> 03:09:03.329]  We have to be equal.
[03:09:05.110 --> 03:09:05.790]  Oh, by the way,
[03:09:08.490 --> 03:09:09.810]  Cuomo says it's shocking.
[03:09:10.371 --> 03:09:14.952]  Most new coronavirus hospitalizations are people who are still staying at home.
[03:09:15.232 --> 03:09:17.133]  Just one stupid thing after another.
[03:09:17.153 --> 03:09:23.956]  Indoor gatherings and private residence must be limited to 10 people beginning on Friday evening.
[03:09:24.296 --> 03:09:29.718]  Hey, what if you have a family of over 10 people?
[03:09:29.738 --> 03:09:30.978]  Ain't gotta break it up!
[03:09:32.058 --> 03:09:33.759]  And do it Friday evening!
[03:09:33.779 --> 03:09:35.980]  I say Saturday night!
[03:09:37.660 --> 03:09:40.121]  Look at the clown show!
[03:09:40.881 --> 03:09:44.842]  Look at the... Look, they've destroyed life with this COVID war, man.
[03:09:45.422 --> 03:09:46.383]  Everything's changed.
[03:09:47.423 --> 03:09:49.424]  Midnight now starts at 10 o'clock.
[03:09:50.364 --> 03:09:51.484]  Nightlife's gone.
[03:09:54.285 --> 03:09:55.966]  And they destroyed the economy.
[03:09:55.986 --> 03:09:58.407]  And I gotta get into all this stuff.
[03:09:58.447 --> 03:10:00.367]  I wanna go back to the economy.
[03:10:02.748 --> 03:10:05.949]  Restaurants, bars, and other businesses with liquor licenses must close.
[03:10:06.644 --> 03:10:09.106]  Dine-in services each night by 10 p.m.
[03:10:09.666 --> 03:10:12.348]  I say close them at 9 p.m!
[03:10:13.429 --> 03:10:15.050]  I'll run for governor!
[03:10:15.450 --> 03:10:16.931]  I say 9 p.m!
[03:10:19.072 --> 03:10:20.813]  You realize what a crap show it is?
[03:10:20.833 --> 03:10:25.576]  Oh, and here's a George Washington quote.
[03:10:26.117 --> 03:10:26.397]  Hey!
[03:10:26.897 --> 03:10:27.998]  Hey, Lloyd Austin!
[03:10:28.338 --> 03:10:34.963]  If you're not hiding in the hospital and not telling anybody, maybe you could have listened to this!
[03:10:36.773 --> 03:10:39.615]  A man, a real general that fought.
[03:10:39.935 --> 03:10:40.275]  Yeah.
[03:10:40.976 --> 03:10:42.977]  Washington crossing the Delaware.
[03:10:42.997 --> 03:10:43.658]  Oh, yeah.
[03:10:43.778 --> 03:10:44.618]  And those boats.
[03:10:45.039 --> 03:10:49.482]  Man, you get in one of those boats, Lloyd Austin, that Biden and the other crew in.
[03:10:49.782 --> 03:10:52.263]  You got to wait to sink it, man.
[03:10:52.283 --> 03:10:56.146]  Oh, you weren't fighting like Washington, were you?
[03:10:56.807 --> 03:10:57.887]  Or betrayed us.
[03:10:57.927 --> 03:10:59.088]  He wasn't either.
[03:10:59.508 --> 03:11:02.871]  So a real man, a real fighter's farewell address.
[03:11:04.552 --> 03:11:06.293]  It is our true policy.
[03:11:07.898 --> 03:11:18.441]  To steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world.
[03:11:18.841 --> 03:11:19.381]  Capisce?
[03:11:20.022 --> 03:11:28.364]  Hey, hey, all you slimeball politicians out there that love war, could you swallow that line?
[03:11:31.866 --> 03:11:36.009]  How about respecting the Founding Fathers that fought for our freedom?
[03:11:36.389 --> 03:11:39.991]  You little clowns that couldn't fight your way out of a paper bag!
[03:11:40.491 --> 03:11:43.353]  Lindsey, did you come out of the closet yet, Graham?
[03:11:44.033 --> 03:11:48.556]  Adam Schi... Oh, look at all those medals!
[03:11:48.976 --> 03:11:51.478]  Hey, what are they, those medals in the Boy Scouts?
[03:11:51.838 --> 03:11:53.379]  And you kept putting them on ya?
[03:11:53.699 --> 03:11:56.321]  Oh, you look great in that military drag!
[03:12:00.732 --> 03:12:03.973]  Observe good faith and justice toward all nations.
[03:12:06.813 --> 03:12:10.314]  Cultivate peace and harmony with all.
[03:12:11.014 --> 03:12:11.414]  Got it?
[03:12:13.814 --> 03:12:18.015]  The nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred.
[03:12:19.475 --> 03:12:21.576]  I hate them dirty Russians!
[03:12:22.156 --> 03:12:24.636]  Those lousy Iranians!
[03:12:25.196 --> 03:12:27.637]  We gotta get them North Koreans!
[03:12:28.057 --> 03:12:29.697]  Oh, those Chinese jinx!
[03:12:32.145 --> 03:12:35.346]  The nation which indulges toward another habitual hatred.
[03:12:35.366 --> 03:12:38.026]  Again, they've been selling that crap, that hatred, all my life.
[03:12:39.326 --> 03:12:40.867]  Or an habitual fondness.
[03:12:41.607 --> 03:12:43.487]  Oh, I love Ukraine!
[03:12:43.927 --> 03:12:47.448]  The most corrupt nation in Europe!
[03:12:47.588 --> 03:12:49.208]  Oh, not according to Solenti.
[03:12:49.608 --> 03:12:59.290]  According to the European Union and the poll taken, 89% of the Ukrainian people said corruption
[03:13:00.146 --> 03:13:03.108]  Was their number one concern after the war.
[03:13:04.309 --> 03:13:05.630]  So the number two concern.
[03:13:06.450 --> 03:13:06.650]  But!
[03:13:08.452 --> 03:13:12.114]  The nation which indulged toward habitual fineness.
[03:13:12.734 --> 03:13:14.656]  Oh and, and oh!
[03:13:15.116 --> 03:13:17.778]  Israel has the right to defend itself.
[03:13:18.338 --> 03:13:20.439]  Nobody else does!
[03:13:22.201 --> 03:13:22.981]  Genocide!
[03:13:23.722 --> 03:13:25.943]  Genocide in front of everybody's eyes.
[03:13:27.104 --> 03:13:28.705]  All to see, it's okay.
[03:13:29.867 --> 03:13:31.407]  I have no habitual fondness.
[03:13:31.768 --> 03:13:32.748]  Hey, I'm an Italian.
[03:13:32.788 --> 03:13:33.528]  I could care less.
[03:13:34.128 --> 03:13:35.008]  You know, do I care?
[03:13:35.028 --> 03:13:35.789]  Of course I care.
[03:13:36.089 --> 03:13:36.829]  None of my business.
[03:13:36.849 --> 03:13:40.770]  You got that Maloney Maloney over there running the show.
[03:13:40.790 --> 03:13:41.550]  A little freak.
[03:13:41.610 --> 03:13:43.731]  Another one after another one after another one.
[03:13:44.191 --> 03:13:57.775]  That guy Conti was the first one to lock down Italy right after China launched the COVID war on Chinese Lunar New Year, the year of the rat, January 2020, when the average age of the people dying in Italy
[03:14:00.779 --> 03:14:02.800]  We're over 81 years old.
[03:14:07.802 --> 03:14:14.185]  And if I hate Mussolini, if I was alive then, would I be anti-Italian?
[03:14:18.707 --> 03:14:18.947]  So.
[03:14:20.848 --> 03:14:21.328]  You got it.
[03:14:23.669 --> 03:14:24.049]  Here it is.
[03:14:25.879 --> 03:14:30.920]  A nation which indulges toward another with habitual hatred or habitual fondness is in some degree a slave.
[03:14:31.720 --> 03:14:34.701]  It's a slavery to its animosity or to its affection.
[03:14:35.861 --> 03:14:40.102]  Passionate attachment to one nation for another produces a variety of evils.
[03:14:40.842 --> 03:14:48.204]  Sympathy for the favorite nation facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases.
[03:14:48.769 --> 03:14:49.329]  Oh, yeah!
[03:14:49.710 --> 03:14:53.111]  If Israel loses, oh, they're our defenders and our saviour!
[03:14:53.251 --> 03:14:53.672]  Crap!
[03:14:54.052 --> 03:15:00.235]  Same crap with... Oh, if we don't stop Russia and Ukraine, oh, then all of Europe will be gone!
[03:15:00.575 --> 03:15:06.118]  Yeah, like the same crap you were shoving down my throat when I was a kid during the Vietnam War!
[03:15:06.619 --> 03:15:13.642]  If we don't stop those... Vietnamese commies, those dominoes will keep falling!
[03:15:14.083 --> 03:15:16.524]  And before you know it, they'll hit the shores of California.
[03:15:16.909 --> 03:15:19.170]  That is the lies that they were saying.
[03:15:19.430 --> 03:15:20.290]  That's not made up.
[03:15:20.550 --> 03:15:22.111]  They're selling the same lies.
[03:15:23.511 --> 03:15:43.659]  Sympathy for a favorite nation facilitating an illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no common interests exist and infusing into one the enmities of the other betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate
[03:15:44.660 --> 03:15:48.662]  Inducement or justification?
[03:15:50.203 --> 03:16:11.233]  Against these, goes on, you know, a couple of paragraphs down, against the assiduous wiles of foreign influence, I conjure you to believe me, fellow citizens, the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake, since history and experience proves that foreign influence
[03:16:11.972 --> 03:16:17.694]  Is one of the most baneful foes of the Republican government.
[03:16:19.234 --> 03:16:19.574]  Got it?
[03:16:20.075 --> 03:16:23.296]  And not the Republicans, Democrats, the Republic of America.
[03:16:26.617 --> 03:16:28.057]  Go to hell, Salenti!
[03:16:29.377 --> 03:16:30.138]  Go to war!
[03:16:30.158 --> 03:16:32.518]  Be a war whore!
[03:16:34.079 --> 03:16:35.579]  They're going on to the economy, eh?
[03:16:35.599 --> 03:16:38.660]  There's an article in CNBC.
[03:16:42.458 --> 03:16:48.521]  Tour this $24 million mansion in Delray Beach, Florida, where home prices have doubled.
[03:16:49.142 --> 03:16:50.282]  Oh, home prices have doubled?
[03:16:51.503 --> 03:16:55.345]  And the plantation workers of Slavelandia can't afford to pay their rent?
[03:16:55.365 --> 03:17:00.008]  It costs now like 38% of the income.
[03:17:00.948 --> 03:17:04.930]  Back years, not many years ago, it was like 30% to pay for your rent.
[03:17:06.091 --> 03:17:07.652]  But the rich keep getting richer.
[03:17:07.672 --> 03:17:11.174]  The military-industrial complex is getting bigger.
[03:17:14.090 --> 03:17:15.231]  And it goes back to gold.
[03:17:16.411 --> 03:17:16.992]  And Bitcoin.
[03:17:17.892 --> 03:17:22.554]  You see the crisis over there in... There's a great article on InfoWars.
[03:17:23.315 --> 03:17:23.835]  Yeah, there it is.
[03:17:23.855 --> 03:17:24.455]  That's the one.
[03:17:24.595 --> 03:17:27.217]  There's a great article on InfoWars.
[03:17:28.838 --> 03:17:29.438]  Ron Paul.
[03:17:31.159 --> 03:17:32.179]  About the debt.
[03:17:34.160 --> 03:17:40.083]  According to the Federal Reserve, and Ron Paul had the honor to be on his show back in January.
[03:17:40.624 --> 03:17:40.784]  So...
[03:17:41.522 --> 03:17:43.503]  You go to Liberty Report and look it up.
[03:17:43.563 --> 03:17:45.203]  I'm very honored.
[03:17:45.303 --> 03:17:49.705]  There is no man in the world that I look up to more than Ron Paul.
[03:17:50.485 --> 03:17:53.286]  And he was the last person that I voted for President.
[03:17:56.027 --> 03:18:04.671]  According to the Federal Reserve, again this is on InfoWars, this article, credit card delinquencies increased by 50% in 2023, while consumer debt grew by
[03:18:09.773 --> 03:18:11.473]  17.5 trillion dollars.
[03:18:12.414 --> 03:18:23.756]  A recent survey by Cleaver Real Estate found that 3 in 5 Americans have credit card debt and that 23% of Americans increase their credit card debt every month.
[03:18:25.276 --> 03:18:28.417]  The survey also found that 48% of Americans, including almost 60% of Millennials,
[03:18:35.672 --> 03:18:39.193]  Use credit cards for essential living expenses.
[03:18:41.234 --> 03:19:00.680]  It goes on to write that since Richard Nixon severed the link between the dollar and gold in August of 1971, the dollar's value has declined by 87% on the government's understated consumer price index numbers.
[03:19:01.240 --> 03:19:02.721]  And when he says understated,
[03:19:03.120 --> 03:19:08.183]  You go to Shadow Stats, it shows you the real CPI numbers.
[03:19:09.204 --> 03:19:12.726]  So the housing prices now are almost $400,000 for a home.
[03:19:13.607 --> 03:19:16.889]  No, no, we're not going to include that.
[03:19:16.909 --> 03:19:17.790]  We're not going to include that.
[03:19:19.210 --> 03:19:20.591]  That's not going to put that in the CPI.
[03:19:20.631 --> 03:19:21.632]  Oh, the price of steak went up.
[03:19:21.672 --> 03:19:23.093]  No, no, people change their diet.
[03:19:24.474 --> 03:19:26.035]  So the CPI numbers are rigged.
[03:19:26.738 --> 03:19:33.040]  Again you look at the you put the go back to like just before this happened or when this happened they just took us off.
[03:19:34.120 --> 03:19:40.222]  If you put inflation in the average price of a new car back in 1973 was $22,000.
[03:19:40.302 --> 03:19:43.723]  That same average price now is $50,000 but don't worry about it.
[03:19:58.272 --> 03:20:05.357]  1% owned 43% of all the global equities.
[03:20:07.238 --> 03:20:14.642]  In the U.S.S.A., 1%, 1% owned 54%.
[03:20:16.523 --> 03:20:20.186]  We are nothing more than plantation workers of Slavelandia.
[03:20:21.807 --> 03:20:26.990]  So to me, the next President of the United States, and I don't hear coming from the mouths of either of them,
[03:20:30.390 --> 03:20:31.431]  Bring home the troops.
[03:20:32.692 --> 03:20:33.933]  Secure the homeland.
[03:20:36.695 --> 03:20:47.284]  Cut the defense budget at least, at least, at least 70%.
[03:20:50.947 --> 03:20:52.188]  Protect the homeland.
[03:20:54.170 --> 03:20:58.714]  If, if you call yourself a true American patriot,
[03:20:59.352 --> 03:21:00.953]  And believe in the Founding Fathers.
[03:21:01.413 --> 03:21:13.201]  So now, going back to what Ron Paul is writing about, where gold is going, where Bitcoin is going, and where the wars are going, in trend forecasting, all things are connected.
[03:21:14.302 --> 03:21:19.805]  Where Chief Seattle allegedly said, all things are connected, like the blood which unites us all.
[03:21:20.606 --> 03:21:24.388]  So now you've got this huge debt to explode.
[03:21:28.226 --> 03:21:28.606]  You got it.
[03:21:28.867 --> 03:21:32.750]  So it's it's approaching $35 trillion in the United States.
[03:21:33.090 --> 03:21:38.495]  Who could run a business and have huge debt and keep printing and keep staying in business?
[03:21:38.515 --> 03:21:38.915]  You can't.
[03:21:39.236 --> 03:21:39.956]  It's impossible.
[03:21:44.821 --> 03:21:47.903]  Then you look at the average person is suffering from day to day.
[03:21:49.465 --> 03:21:53.108]  And again, nobody reports about the damage of the COVID war.
[03:21:53.128 --> 03:21:55.250]  So now we're going to go back to gold and Bitcoin.
[03:21:56.621 --> 03:22:02.064]  You take Bitcoin and you've got places like Argentina, where you've got what?
[03:22:02.084 --> 03:22:07.147]  Inflation is over 200%, it's ridiculous, I think it's like 220% or something.
[03:22:08.687 --> 03:22:13.810]  And this is going on all over the world, in a lot of places, in a lot of the developing nations.
[03:22:14.631 --> 03:22:18.893]  So people can't afford to buy gold, instead of buying a little bit of Bitcoin.
[03:22:19.713 --> 03:22:24.616]  Because all they're going to see, oh, by the way, in Turkey their inflation numbers just skyrocketed again.
[03:22:26.164 --> 03:22:28.146]  So the people are going to keep buying Bitcoin.
[03:22:29.086 --> 03:22:34.291]  If Bitcoin wasn't here, you would see gold prices more than double what they are.
[03:22:35.692 --> 03:22:44.859]  So Bitcoin's going to stay around and I was on this segment with Max Keiser, who's really a Bitcoin king.
[03:22:45.940 --> 03:22:48.202]  And this guy was one of the first cats to call it.
[03:22:49.643 --> 03:22:53.226]  And I made it very clear, I'm totally positive of it.
[03:22:53.266 --> 03:22:55.468]  It's not what I like, what I don't like, what I wish,
[03:22:56.181 --> 03:22:56.621]  It's what is.
[03:22:58.203 --> 03:23:18.120]  And the only way I see Bitcoin going down is if when they go to CBDC, Central Bank Digital Currency, which they're going to do, because they can't handle the debt crisis in country after country.
[03:23:18.780 --> 03:23:22.884]  So they're going to make up a story, the Russians hacked our banking system.
[03:23:25.376 --> 03:23:26.596]  Don't worry about it.
[03:23:26.616 --> 03:23:27.717]  Don't worry about it.
[03:23:27.737 --> 03:23:29.197]  We're going to get you new money.
[03:23:30.357 --> 03:23:38.219]  Oh, by the way, with that credit card debt, you know, as an Italian kid growing up, you know, they used to call us Italians, guineas and wops.
[03:23:39.419 --> 03:23:44.060]  Oh, and RFK, yeah, went after the mafia.
[03:23:45.780 --> 03:23:47.701]  Oh, those dirty guineas, they're charging 10%.
[03:23:47.761 --> 03:23:49.541]  Hey!
[03:23:50.561 --> 03:23:53.022]  I'm Bank of America!
[03:23:53.829 --> 03:23:55.749]  We could charge you 30%!
[03:23:55.849 --> 03:23:57.350]  Oh, no, Celenti, 29.4%.
[03:24:00.330 --> 03:24:04.411]  This is a crime organization right in front of everybody's eyes!
[03:24:05.031 --> 03:24:06.771]  Right in front of everybody's eyes!
[03:24:07.431 --> 03:24:09.732]  Oh, but you went after the mafia!
[03:24:09.832 --> 03:24:10.452]  Oh, yeah!
[03:24:12.192 --> 03:24:15.053]  And they were doing it on the side, people who couldn't afford things.
[03:24:16.133 --> 03:24:21.114]  Look at the outrageous, the outrageous numbers!
[03:24:23.168 --> 03:24:29.373]  That these bankster bandits are charging people with credit cards.
[03:24:30.814 --> 03:24:32.495]  Where is the outrage?
[03:24:32.615 --> 03:24:39.801]  So again, my presidential candidate, get rid of this.
[03:24:42.883 --> 03:24:43.583]  Get rid of this.
[03:24:48.747 --> 03:24:49.408]  Let's make
[03:24:51.138 --> 03:24:54.599]  The interest rate on debt in credit cards, 5%.
[03:24:59.021 --> 03:24:59.221]  Not 29%.
[03:24:59.722 --> 03:25:03.543]  Oh, and he's buy now, pay later.
[03:25:03.563 --> 03:25:06.424]  Yeah, I think it was like I averaged like 36%.
[03:25:07.965 --> 03:25:09.826]  You buy now, go broke later.
[03:25:12.987 --> 03:25:14.488]  And then you go back to gold.
[03:25:15.488 --> 03:25:20.250]  Go back to Ron Paul talks about the credit card debt, you got to look at the government debt.
[03:25:23.749 --> 03:25:24.630]  And here's the deal.
[03:25:27.011 --> 03:25:29.773]  Simple, simple as can be.
[03:25:31.934 --> 03:25:38.998]  Again, we forecast this in your Trends Journal, and you go to jonestrends.com, and you get a real bargain.
[03:25:39.439 --> 03:25:46.683]  It's like $2.50 a week, over 170 pages a week, with trend forecasts that you won't find anywhere else in the world.
[03:25:48.484 --> 03:25:53.307]  So you go back, the lower interest rates, the dollar goes down.
[03:25:54.676 --> 03:25:57.338]  Oh, the dollar with a $35 trillion debt load?
[03:25:57.358 --> 03:25:59.940]  This is the beginning of the death of the dollar.
[03:26:01.461 --> 03:26:09.487]  The lower the dollar goes, the higher gold prices go up.
[03:26:10.187 --> 03:26:16.552]  Because gold is dollar-based.
[03:26:17.573 --> 03:26:23.117]  So countries, other currencies, go up when the dollar goes down, they'll be able to buy more gold.
[03:26:23.749 --> 03:26:28.752]  And the Chinese are buying it up like crazy right now, because they see their economy going down.
[03:26:29.212 --> 03:26:32.214]  And again, in your Trends Journal, we have Spotlight on Chinese Economy.
[03:26:33.335 --> 03:26:44.962]  And again, I had forecast that the 20th century was the American century, but the 21st century would be the Chinese century, because the business of China was business, and the business of America is war.
[03:26:46.092 --> 03:26:53.658]  And they say nobody could be a futurist because, don't call me a futurist, there are too many wild cards whether they're made by humans or by nature.
[03:26:55.319 --> 03:27:00.483]  So, as I said, the United States spent all its money going to war while China's business is business.
[03:27:01.203 --> 03:27:03.365]  Now, they launched a COVID war.
[03:27:03.965 --> 03:27:04.486]  That's right.
[03:27:05.367 --> 03:27:09.770]  They went to war, destroyed the economy, three years of zero COVID policy.
[03:27:11.311 --> 03:27:13.833]  So now, the thing's going down the crapper.
[03:27:16.260 --> 03:27:18.501]  Don't worry, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:27:19.302 --> 03:27:21.323]  So watch for the Taiwan things to heat up.
[03:27:21.803 --> 03:27:22.964]  So going back to gold.
[03:27:24.485 --> 03:27:31.889]  The lower interest rates go, the lower the dollar falls, and the higher gold prices rise.
[03:27:33.190 --> 03:27:38.993]  This is just the beginning of the sharp spike in gold.
[03:27:40.454 --> 03:27:42.535]  And with Bitcoin,
[03:27:45.495 --> 03:27:46.756]  There's no top coming.
[03:27:47.996 --> 03:27:48.976]  Of course it's going to go down.
[03:27:49.036 --> 03:27:50.457]  Nothing goes straight up or straight down.
[03:27:51.558 --> 03:27:55.439]  And then when you look at the equity markets, the magnificent seven.
[03:27:58.520 --> 03:28:00.021]  Why don't we look at other data?
[03:28:01.462 --> 03:28:04.563]  How people are living 63% paycheck to paycheck.
[03:28:07.684 --> 03:28:10.845]  Again, 1% on 54% of the equities.
[03:28:11.566 --> 03:28:14.667]  And then each week in the Trends Journal, we have the bigs getting bigger.
[03:28:15.445 --> 03:28:17.747]  All the buyouts, all the buyouts.
[03:28:18.427 --> 03:28:24.131]  Again, when I was a young guy, private equity groups, venture capitalists, hedge funds, they did not exist.
[03:28:24.651 --> 03:28:26.272]  And they're the ones that own these companies.
[03:28:26.692 --> 03:28:32.156]  With the same hedge funds, private equity groups, hedge funds, capital, they own Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola, one company.
[03:28:33.637 --> 03:28:34.758]  So there's going to be a bust.
[03:28:34.818 --> 03:28:37.199]  When we come back, I'm going to talk about the banking bust.
[03:28:38.200 --> 03:28:42.943]  Because this is going to bring down the economy and make the reality hit the street.
[03:28:43.462 --> 03:28:48.626]  Because Main Street doesn't know how bad it is until it hits Wall Street.
[03:28:49.426 --> 03:28:51.128]  So again, support InfoWars.
[03:28:51.388 --> 03:28:52.188]  We'll be right back.
[03:28:52.709 --> 03:28:57.072]  Stay tuned for a lot more.
[03:28:57.112 --> 03:28:58.813]  Folks, we're standing up for our rights.
[03:28:58.853 --> 03:28:59.914]  We're standing up for your rights.
[03:28:59.954 --> 03:29:02.356]  We're standing up for all of our freedoms and our children.
[03:29:02.556 --> 03:29:10.222]  If you don't spread the word about the broadcast, if you don't share the links, if you don't buy products at InfoWars.com, then I'm not bribing at you.
[03:29:10.242 --> 03:29:11.323]  I'm just saying, what are you doing?
[03:29:12.403 --> 03:29:15.725]  Less than 1% of you ever buy a product at Infowarestore.com.
[03:29:16.605 --> 03:29:24.489]  If just a half a percent more would go buy a book or a film or a t-shirt or get some of our great supplements and then reorder them because they really work, just try it.
[03:29:25.109 --> 03:29:27.030]  We would be able to do so many things.
[03:29:27.410 --> 03:29:31.192]  I'm praying to God that he'll touch your heart to decide to support us.
[03:29:31.713 --> 03:29:33.453]  Infowarestore.com.
[03:29:35.623 --> 03:29:38.344]  It's been sold out, it's back in stock, reformulated even stronger.
[03:29:39.145 --> 03:29:41.025]  Nitric boost to clean out your blood and your whole body.
[03:29:41.466 --> 03:29:42.566]  Vasodilation.
[03:29:43.206 --> 03:29:45.687]  It's got a lot of wonderful side effects, and I mean good ones.
[03:29:46.068 --> 03:29:46.808]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[03:29:47.448 --> 03:29:49.309]  It is powerful, so be careful with it.
[03:29:49.649 --> 03:29:53.571]  Next Level Fundational Energy, InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:29:58.137 --> 03:30:01.259]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:30:01.279 --> 03:30:02.840]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:30:03.600 --> 03:30:06.642]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:30:07.542 --> 03:30:11.465]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers...
[03:30:12.904 --> 03:30:15.605]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:30:16.445 --> 03:30:24.268]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:30:25.268 --> 03:30:28.129]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:30:28.149 --> 03:30:33.851]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:30:34.691 --> 03:30:35.611]  I know you spread the word.
[03:30:35.651 --> 03:30:37.132]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[03:30:37.172 --> 03:30:37.692]  Keep doing it.
[03:30:37.732 --> 03:30:46.016]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsTore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keeping us on air.
[03:30:46.676 --> 03:30:50.317]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:30:50.978 --> 03:30:55.599]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsTore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:30:55.920 --> 03:30:56.700]  Please take action now.

[03:31:11.978 --> 03:31:17.840]  The curcuminoids in turmeric is one of nature's most powerful and beneficial medicines.
[03:31:18.460 --> 03:31:22.922]  Raw turmeric root contains about 5% of this incredible medicine.
[03:31:24.062 --> 03:31:27.863]  But our bodies has been formulated to contain over 95%.
[03:31:30.171 --> 03:31:35.595]  This makes bodies one of the most powerful natural antioxidants in the world.

[03:33:23.421 --> 03:33:29.365]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:29.965 --> 03:33:34.088]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente.
[03:33:38.504 --> 03:33:40.705]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:40.745 --> 03:33:42.125]  Every Monday I look forward to it.
[03:33:42.806 --> 03:33:48.508]  Because I admire what Alex Jones and the crew do to give you what you're not getting anywhere else.
[03:33:49.588 --> 03:33:54.750]  And the, uh, you know, true men and women, you know, real fighters.
[03:33:54.870 --> 03:33:58.011]  I mean, with Owen, had to go through Owen Schroeder, you know.
[03:33:58.721 --> 03:33:58.901]  Yeah.
[03:33:58.981 --> 03:34:00.603]  So anyway, I also, you know,
[03:34:16.158 --> 03:34:20.781]  Love the products that they have because they help you and it helps InfoWars.
[03:34:21.261 --> 03:34:25.683]  And they got, you know, there's great deals that keep coming up week after week, every week I come on here.
[03:34:26.084 --> 03:34:32.787]  And now they have this another great deal with these bodies and you got to ease that bod, man, into what's going on now.
[03:34:33.368 --> 03:34:37.110]  And it's really, it's the perfect answer to whole body support.
[03:34:37.570 --> 03:34:38.571]  It's back in stock.
[03:34:38.631 --> 03:34:40.092]  You get 40% off.
[03:34:40.752 --> 03:34:44.234]  And again, we've said this, you know, over and over, it's a, um,
[03:34:45.478 --> 03:34:49.339]  It's an additional herb that's been used for thousands of years, this turmeric.
[03:34:49.819 --> 03:34:52.600]  It's one of the most studied ingredients known today.
[03:34:52.940 --> 03:34:55.761]  And what they do is they pair it with black pepper.
[03:34:56.241 --> 03:35:04.724]  So the body uses turmeric supplemented and it takes advantage of the power of turmeric with over 95% of its active ingredients.
[03:35:06.324 --> 03:35:11.146]  So again, it contains some of the most powerful antioxidants and they pair it
[03:35:12.796 --> 03:35:16.317]  With other powerful ingredients and five different herbs and extracts.
[03:35:17.077 --> 03:35:20.958]  So you're really getting the ultimate boost, not only for yourself, but for your family.
[03:35:21.478 --> 03:35:23.499]  And again, you're boosting InfoWars up too.
[03:35:23.519 --> 03:35:26.479]  So, you know, it's a 360 win.
[03:35:26.519 --> 03:35:33.201]  You get joint support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammation support, and InfoWars support.
[03:35:33.801 --> 03:35:36.822]  So get what you can and do what you can with this.

[03:35:47.314 --> 03:35:51.816]  And again, this is the medicinal herb for thousands of years.
[03:35:53.737 --> 03:35:55.658]  How come the drug companies didn't invent this?
[03:35:56.518 --> 03:35:56.918]  Anyway.
[03:35:57.979 --> 03:36:00.780]  So anyway, you're going to run out of stock, so get it now.
[03:36:01.300 --> 03:36:03.921]  You go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:36:03.981 --> 03:36:05.422]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:36:05.902 --> 03:36:08.363]  You get your bodies because your bodies need you.
[03:36:10.243 --> 03:36:10.644]  Again, 360Win.
[03:36:12.827 --> 03:36:25.411]  You know, I was, just before I went off the air, I said I'm going to talk about Banks Go Bust, one of our top trends for 2024.
[03:36:26.171 --> 03:36:33.094]  And I said this banking crisis is going to create the worst financial crisis in modern history.
[03:36:33.814 --> 03:36:35.154]  So, let me give you the background.
[03:36:35.174 --> 03:36:37.855]  It goes back to the COVID war.
[03:36:41.557 --> 03:36:42.417]  When they locked down
[03:36:43.712 --> 03:36:45.133]  Forced everybody to work at home.
[03:36:46.814 --> 03:36:55.761]  People working at home week after week, month after month, year after year, and they're saying to themselves, I'm getting up at five o'clock in the morning to commute an hour and a half each way.
[03:36:55.781 --> 03:36:56.442]  I'm not doing this.
[03:36:57.102 --> 03:36:57.702]  This is terrible.
[03:37:00.244 --> 03:37:01.665]  It's costing me all this money.
[03:37:02.246 --> 03:37:07.310]  I can't believe I'm losing my life driving a car, sitting in a... I can't believe this.
[03:37:07.370 --> 03:37:08.070]  I'm not doing anything.
[03:37:09.531 --> 03:37:12.774]  So, let's say I'm the guy that's the boss.
[03:37:13.683 --> 03:37:16.524]  And I got 10 floors in an office building.
[03:37:18.164 --> 03:37:19.685]  I got everybody working in cubicles.
[03:37:19.745 --> 03:37:20.325]  I don't see them.
[03:37:21.966 --> 03:37:22.566]  Yeah, stay home.
[03:37:22.606 --> 03:37:23.586]  I don't need all these floors.
[03:37:28.788 --> 03:37:30.428]  Okay, I'm the office building owner.
[03:37:30.448 --> 03:37:32.529]  How am I going to pay my mortgage?
[03:37:33.669 --> 03:37:37.130]  My mortgage is interest-based, by the way.
[03:37:37.150 --> 03:37:43.552]  And now my mortgage is up about $1.5 trillion worth in the commercial real estate sector.
[03:37:46.254 --> 03:37:49.036]  When I got these buildings, interest rates were way down.
[03:37:49.056 --> 03:37:50.658]  Now they're way up.
[03:37:52.760 --> 03:37:53.861]  And I don't have money coming in.
[03:37:53.881 --> 03:37:54.621]  I'm going to default.
[03:37:57.124 --> 03:37:58.665]  You're going to default, who's it going to hit?
[03:37:59.365 --> 03:38:00.106]  It's going to hit the banks.
[03:38:03.209 --> 03:38:04.730]  The banks are derivative based.
[03:38:05.611 --> 03:38:12.517]  They put all these government bonds when you had zero interest rate policies, so the bonds ain't worth anything.
[03:38:14.858 --> 03:38:23.321]  And again, before I go further, I thought the economy is going to collapse in May of 2020.
[03:38:25.161 --> 03:38:27.522]  Because they launched the COVID war in January of 2020.
[03:38:29.663 --> 03:38:36.765]  Imposed the lockdowns, Trump did, on March 13th, 2020, Black Friday.
[03:38:38.866 --> 03:38:40.246]  It's like this thing is going to go down.
[03:38:41.146 --> 03:38:43.367]  I never thought that they would bring
[03:38:43.840 --> 03:38:49.242]  Interest rates down to zero or pump in countless trillions of dollars.
[03:38:49.282 --> 03:38:50.642]  Hey, you don't go to work, here's some money.
[03:38:50.662 --> 03:38:52.243]  You got a business, don't worry about it, here's some money.
[03:38:52.963 --> 03:38:56.044]  So they artificially propped everything up and it goes back to the debt bubble.
[03:38:58.485 --> 03:38:59.805]  So now let's go back to the banks.
[03:39:01.306 --> 03:39:07.128]  So when we took the break, so let me go run over to my computer and see what's going on.
[03:39:07.808 --> 03:39:11.709]  So I go to CNBC and here's the headline.
[03:39:14.429 --> 03:39:25.473]  Some NYCB deposits may be at risk if the Moody's downgrades banks' ratings again.
[03:39:25.493 --> 03:39:26.794]  All right?
[03:39:27.434 --> 03:39:28.275]  Breaking news!
[03:39:29.195 --> 03:39:31.676]  And what did I say before we took the break?
[03:39:32.216 --> 03:39:36.878]  When I come back, we're going to talk about the banking bust.
[03:39:37.298 --> 03:39:40.019]  And here it is, right in front of your eyes.
[03:39:42.400 --> 03:39:44.081]  There's no way in the world
[03:39:44.977 --> 03:40:05.344]  That these banks are going to be able to withstand the commercial office building bust that's going to hit, not only now, but year after year after year, as these loans come due.
[03:40:08.305 --> 03:40:11.866]  So, says the Federal Reserve,
[03:40:15.270 --> 03:40:16.371]  Said they're at risk, right?
[03:40:17.672 --> 03:40:18.673]  We'll cover $250,000.
[03:40:18.993 --> 03:40:22.255]  Yeah, right.
[03:40:23.937 --> 03:40:24.857]  Holiday.
[03:40:25.338 --> 03:40:27.419]  Let's call a bank holiday.
[03:40:27.899 --> 03:40:28.840]  Isn't that a nice word?
[03:40:29.721 --> 03:40:32.003]  Orwell would have loved that word FDR.
[03:40:32.523 --> 03:40:34.224]  Or is it F-U-C-W-A-T-D-R?
[03:40:34.264 --> 03:40:34.564]  Yeah.
[03:40:36.326 --> 03:40:37.206]  Bank holiday.
[03:40:38.728 --> 03:40:39.828]  Can't get your money out.
[03:40:40.969 --> 03:40:43.211]  Again, goes back to a digital currency.
[03:40:45.891 --> 03:40:51.233]  When the banks go bust, and things go bust, they're going to come up with an alternative.
[03:40:51.573 --> 03:40:52.734]  Again, they make stuff up.
[03:40:54.214 --> 03:40:56.095]  I also thought the markets would crash in 2012.
[03:40:56.635 --> 03:40:59.216]  And again, you look at my track record.
[03:40:59.857 --> 03:41:00.677]  It's not BS.
[03:41:01.877 --> 03:41:04.738]  I called the 1987 stock market crash.
[03:41:04.778 --> 03:41:06.499]  Wall Street Journal credited me with that.
[03:41:07.760 --> 03:41:11.301]  I called the Asian currency crisis.
[03:41:13.479 --> 03:41:15.179]  Here's your Trends Journal Magazine.
[03:41:17.300 --> 03:41:20.820]  Fall of 1999, when it used to be a quarterly, now it's a weekly.
[03:41:21.640 --> 03:41:31.262]  .com this, warning that the .com would bust by the second quarter of 2000, and it busted in March of 2000.
[03:41:32.983 --> 03:41:35.123]  I took out the domain name, thepanicof08, in 2007.
[03:41:35.223 --> 03:41:37.823]  It's right there, the facts.
[03:41:44.158 --> 03:41:45.878]  And I thought the markets would bust again in 2012.
[03:41:47.539 --> 03:41:58.701]  They didn't teach me about quantitative easing or zero interest rate policy in Economics 101 in graduate school.
[03:42:00.122 --> 03:42:01.582]  They're going to make something up.
[03:42:04.883 --> 03:42:06.443]  This banking bust is real.
[03:42:06.463 --> 03:42:10.824]  They're going to do everything they can to prevent it.
[03:42:12.990 --> 03:42:16.513]  And digital currencies is going to be one of the things we're forecasting.
[03:42:17.173 --> 03:42:19.235]  From dirty cash to digital trash.
[03:42:20.816 --> 03:42:27.321]  They know every penny you spent, what you spent it on, where.
[03:42:28.882 --> 03:42:30.323]  They know everything about you.
[03:42:31.564 --> 03:42:32.925]  More about technocracy.
[03:42:33.906 --> 03:42:34.347]  Owning you.
[03:42:35.007 --> 03:42:37.309]  And again, great technocracy came
[03:42:37.898 --> 03:42:39.879]  Guy knows more about it than anybody that I know.
[03:42:39.919 --> 03:42:42.380]  Joe Duran writes about it all the time in the Trends Journal.
[03:42:42.421 --> 03:42:43.161]  Here's one of his books.
[03:42:44.141 --> 03:42:45.402]  Technopolis, the human.
[03:42:47.143 --> 03:42:48.044]  That's what they're going to do.
[03:42:49.504 --> 03:42:52.726]  So when we come back, we're going to help you prepare for what's next.
[03:42:53.226 --> 03:42:53.767]  So stay tuned.

[03:43:07.176 --> 03:43:09.137]  But if you don't support us, we won't be here.
[03:43:10.598 --> 03:43:14.340]  Plus, you really need Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, 95% curcuminoid.
[03:43:14.880 --> 03:43:17.742]  The strongest other top brands are 75-80%.
[03:43:18.022 --> 03:43:18.702]  Nobody makes it 95.
[03:43:18.982 --> 03:43:21.043]  We want the top makers.
[03:43:21.063 --> 03:43:22.304]  We want the strongest you can make.

[03:43:28.848 --> 03:43:30.409]  We've been selling Nitric Boost for a couple of years.
[03:43:30.429 --> 03:43:33.591]  Never had it below $25 because there was hardly any profit there.
[03:43:33.651 --> 03:43:36.593]  We went to a place that gives us stuff just as good or even better.
[03:43:36.613 --> 03:43:37.494]  That's where we're getting it from.
[03:43:38.055 --> 03:43:40.837]  And it's 40% off, passing the savings on to you.

[03:45:43.488 --> 03:45:46.809]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:45:46.950 --> 03:45:48.030]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:45:48.350 --> 03:45:51.291]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:45:51.311 --> 03:45:55.553]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[03:46:13.626 --> 03:46:16.131]  We really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:46:16.151 --> 03:46:24.806]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroeder and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:46:25.808 --> 03:46:28.709]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:46:29.429 --> 03:46:34.450]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:46:35.251 --> 03:46:38.232]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[03:46:38.272 --> 03:46:44.893]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[03:46:45.334 --> 03:46:46.514]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[03:46:47.214 --> 03:46:50.878]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsaw.com.
[03:46:51.519 --> 03:46:56.163]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsaw.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:46:56.464 --> 03:46:57.325]  Please take action now.
[03:46:58.606 --> 03:47:04.512]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:16.604 --> 03:47:18.606]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:47:18.966 --> 03:47:21.168]  It's Gerald Celente.
[03:47:21.728 --> 03:47:24.910]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:24.991 --> 03:47:29.554]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:29.594 --> 03:47:35.659]  And again, do what you can to support InfoWars, because they're doing everything they can to support you.
[03:47:35.679 --> 03:47:38.761]  And remember, The Trend is your friend.
[03:47:40.002 --> 03:47:44.846]  And there's no magazine in the world that comes close to The Trend's journal.
[03:47:45.549 --> 03:47:47.591]  If you can find one, let me know.
[03:47:48.672 --> 03:47:51.614]  Weekly magazine, over 170 pages a week.
[03:47:51.794 --> 03:47:53.976]  You read what you want, or you can listen to it, too.
[03:47:54.897 --> 03:48:01.823]  And, you go to jonestrends.com, and it's about the grand total of $2.50 a week.
[03:48:02.764 --> 03:48:06.847]  The toilet paper record, the New York Times, $4 a day.
[03:48:08.168 --> 03:48:13.833]  The Wall Street Journal, I can't use the right name here, it begins with an S and an H, ends with a T.
[03:48:14.710 --> 03:48:17.453]  Journal is $5 a day.
[03:48:17.493 --> 03:48:19.234]  I'm barely getting anything out of this.
[03:48:19.334 --> 03:48:25.020]  Just to show you the hypocrisy before we go on to more about the Bankings Go Bust.
[03:48:26.100 --> 03:48:28.703]  This is the toilet paper record Sunday.
[03:48:30.324 --> 03:48:31.385]  Look at this guy over here.
[03:48:37.571 --> 03:48:39.533]  A war's less visible wounds.
[03:48:40.501 --> 03:48:45.262]  Achim Guz, 25, was among the thousands of Ukrainians treated for brain injuries.
[03:48:46.342 --> 03:48:53.144]  How about showing all those Palestinians being shot and starving to death?
[03:48:54.224 --> 03:48:57.524]  Not an article here about it.
[03:48:58.045 --> 03:48:58.625]  Front page.
[03:48:59.785 --> 03:49:01.525]  Warning lights flash for Biden.
[03:49:02.505 --> 03:49:03.566]  Time polls fine.
[03:49:03.606 --> 03:49:04.406]  Yeah, warning lights.
[03:49:07.266 --> 03:49:07.786]  Oh, here's one.
[03:49:07.846 --> 03:49:10.167]  Trump offers no clear view on Gaza war.
[03:49:13.695 --> 03:49:20.140]  Housing plan, but again, he's been, he's, the quote from him, he said, nobody's been more supportive of Israel than him.
[03:49:21.001 --> 03:49:23.243]  They did the Pompeo, Pompeo thing.
[03:49:24.324 --> 03:49:34.312]  And, um, where they, they said that it's okay for Israel to keep building settlement, uh, stealing land in the Golan Heights.
[03:49:35.333 --> 03:49:39.396]  And, uh, you know, uh, he goes, um,
[03:49:45.486 --> 03:49:54.090]  They write here, Trump's Middle East policy as president unapologetically and lopsidedly favored Israel against the Palestinians.
[03:49:54.110 --> 03:49:58.591]  He gave Mr. Netanyahu nearly everything he wanted, including moving the U.S.
[03:49:58.651 --> 03:50:06.415]  Embassy to Jerusalem and recognizing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, you know, reversing things.
[03:50:06.475 --> 03:50:10.556]  So, you know, it's but anyway, you know, I don't support either of them.
[03:50:14.872 --> 03:50:17.893]  But anyway, just to show you what you're not getting.
[03:50:18.714 --> 03:50:22.755]  And then you go to the New York Times on Saturday.
[03:50:22.795 --> 03:50:24.176]  Again, it's $4 a day.
[03:50:25.136 --> 03:50:26.257]  On, let's see, the weekend, $6.
[03:50:28.758 --> 03:50:30.398]  Not one worthy article in this.
[03:50:31.339 --> 03:50:32.299]  Just stupid stuff.
[03:50:33.860 --> 03:50:36.020]  This guy with the head.
[03:50:37.921 --> 03:50:39.222]  You go inside the paper.
[03:50:41.983 --> 03:50:42.263]  Look at this.
[03:50:45.779 --> 03:50:47.679]  Two pages of this stuff and more.
[03:50:48.320 --> 03:50:48.680]  Look at this.
[03:50:49.440 --> 03:50:50.400]  What do I care about this?
[03:50:50.480 --> 03:50:51.580]  I'm a trend forecaster.
[03:50:51.600 --> 03:50:55.741]  I need information that's going to help me see the current events forming future trends.
[03:50:57.602 --> 03:50:58.262]  Six dollars.
[03:50:58.302 --> 03:51:03.003]  Again, two dollars and fifty cents a week for the Trends Journal.
[03:51:03.343 --> 03:51:04.603]  Jonestrends.com.
[03:51:05.643 --> 03:51:07.224]  This is Saturday's New York Times.
[03:51:08.424 --> 03:51:09.204]  Front page story.
[03:51:09.224 --> 03:51:13.205]  Again, nothing about the Gazan kids getting their heads blown apart.
[03:51:15.697 --> 03:51:16.698]  I'm starving to death.
[03:51:17.098 --> 03:51:30.108]  At a funeral for the Russian opposition leader, Novani in Moscow, a traditional chaplet rested on Mr. Novani's head.
[03:51:31.189 --> 03:51:33.791]  Oh, I'm glad it was a traditional chaplet.
[03:51:34.512 --> 03:51:38.455]  I mean, I would have been heartbroken if it was a non-traditional chaplet.
[03:51:38.815 --> 03:51:39.155]  Hey!
[03:51:40.016 --> 03:51:40.296]  Hey!
[03:51:41.157 --> 03:51:42.078]  Prestitutes!
[03:51:42.638 --> 03:51:44.740]  Hey, media whores that get paid to put out
[03:51:45.464 --> 03:51:48.986]  Be a government whoremasters and your corporate pimps.
[03:51:50.427 --> 03:51:52.689]  How about Julian Assange?
[03:51:53.049 --> 03:51:56.691]  What do I care about this guy that allegedly worked for the CIA?
[03:51:57.972 --> 03:51:59.993]  Hate the Russians, hate the Russians.
[03:52:06.077 --> 03:52:09.339]  Thousands defy Kremlin in honor of Navalny.
[03:52:10.300 --> 03:52:11.581]  The Wall Street Journal.
[03:52:18.380 --> 03:52:19.221]  Six dollars.
[03:52:21.422 --> 03:52:22.323]  Weekend edition.
[03:52:23.523 --> 03:52:25.725]  Musk lawsuits takes on OpenAI.
[03:52:25.945 --> 03:52:26.085]  Yep.
[03:52:29.507 --> 03:52:31.308]  And this is the propaganda they sell.
[03:52:33.170 --> 03:52:36.912]  Hunger, desperation, fear turned aid convoy deadly.
[03:52:37.312 --> 03:52:37.872]  No, it didn't.
[03:52:38.913 --> 03:52:42.115]  Israeli soldiers shooting at innocent people turned it deadly.
[03:52:42.535 --> 03:52:44.777]  Again, we put the details in your Trends Journal.
[03:52:45.515 --> 03:52:47.116]  Quoting what the Israelis said.
[03:52:47.456 --> 03:52:49.578]  Well, our troops were fearful.
[03:52:50.058 --> 03:52:51.059]  So, what fearful?
[03:52:51.099 --> 03:52:54.201]  What are you doing there, number one?
[03:52:54.261 --> 03:52:55.001]  Hamases?
[03:52:55.902 --> 03:52:57.663]  Dressed up as women and children?
[03:52:58.363 --> 03:52:59.404]  You're bombing this place?
[03:52:59.424 --> 03:52:59.664]  What the?
[03:52:59.984 --> 03:53:01.285]  I've had it with this crap.
[03:53:01.565 --> 03:53:04.587]  Bombing the hell out of this, destroying it, starving people to death.
[03:53:04.827 --> 03:53:05.868]  We're getting Hamas!
[03:53:06.068 --> 03:53:07.169]  Who are you talking to?
[03:53:07.189 --> 03:53:10.951]  Here.
[03:53:11.792 --> 03:53:13.333]  Scores killed in Gaza.
[03:53:13.985 --> 03:53:16.846]  After desperate crowd gathers at food trucks.
[03:53:17.526 --> 03:53:20.847]  Total propaganda by the toilet paper record.
[03:53:21.107 --> 03:53:21.467]  No, no.
[03:53:22.088 --> 03:53:24.568]  Scores killed by Israelis.
[03:53:26.189 --> 03:53:27.990]  Oh, and by the way, I'm getting hated.
[03:53:28.610 --> 03:53:38.953]  They're calling me, uh... One guy said, uh... For 147 days you have been on the side of evil and a supporter of terrorist Hamas.
[03:53:39.473 --> 03:53:41.794]  Let this little boy come over and say this to me.
[03:53:42.819 --> 03:53:44.499]  I'm totally opposed to what Hamas did.
[03:53:44.979 --> 03:53:48.840]  I asked this little clown, send me one, one clip of me saying that.
[03:53:50.420 --> 03:53:51.021]  Here's another one.
[03:53:53.001 --> 03:53:53.621]  F.U.
[03:53:53.701 --> 03:53:57.862]  Salenti, you anti-Semitic piece of S.H.
[03:54:00.202 --> 03:54:06.723]  I'll never subscribe to you again or listen to any of your biased propaganda garbage ever again.
[03:54:08.224 --> 03:54:09.564]  Of course, I can't read
[03:54:11.837 --> 03:54:18.501]  When I responded, shoved the BS line of calling me an anti-Semite up your you-know-what.
[03:54:22.964 --> 03:54:23.464]  Another one.
[03:54:26.046 --> 03:54:29.168]  Counts will be cancelled and forever you hate Israel.
[03:54:30.609 --> 03:54:32.069]  I and friends hate you.
[03:54:34.011 --> 03:54:35.632]  My slobbering, filthy mouth.
[03:54:35.672 --> 03:54:36.812]  I have to speak properly.
[03:54:37.793 --> 03:54:39.394]  Speak properly as you're slaughtering.
[03:54:40.916 --> 03:54:43.058]  Get this in your mind, little boy.
[03:54:43.078 --> 03:54:50.263]  If you're not angry, when it's morally justifiable to be angry, you are immoral.
[03:54:52.024 --> 03:54:52.505]  Said St.
[03:54:52.545 --> 03:54:54.506]  Thomas Aquinas, words to that effect.
[03:54:55.307 --> 03:54:58.669]  And it's proper language when someone is effing with your life.
[03:55:00.010 --> 03:55:01.331]  But you're still in kindergarten.
[03:55:07.175 --> 03:55:07.396]  Yep.
[03:55:08.396 --> 03:55:09.197]  That's what we got here.
[03:55:10.669 --> 03:55:12.689]  Freak show in front of everybody's eyes!
[03:55:14.730 --> 03:55:28.252]  United Nations Human Rights Chiefs Volker Turk said the war in Gaza is a powder keg that could ignite a wider conflict with serious repercussions for the Middle East and beyond.
[03:55:28.532 --> 03:55:28.752]  Wow!
[03:55:28.812 --> 03:55:29.312]  No kidding!
[03:55:29.352 --> 03:55:29.912]  Blow me away!
[03:55:29.972 --> 03:55:30.832]  Just said this today!
[03:55:30.853 --> 03:55:32.973]  How about reading a trends journal?
[03:55:33.573 --> 03:55:35.013]  World War III has begun!
[03:55:36.573 --> 03:55:39.234]  Israel has bought more bombs away over Syria
[03:55:39.850 --> 03:55:42.972]  They just killed another couple of Iranian commanders.
[03:55:44.773 --> 03:55:46.715]  More bombs away in Lebanon.
[03:55:49.397 --> 03:55:54.480]  They blew up Iranian pipelines a week and a half ago.
[03:55:54.500 --> 03:56:05.407]  The United States and Israel go to war against Iran.
[03:56:07.169 --> 03:56:08.950]  World War III will become official.
[03:56:10.552 --> 03:56:15.156]  Right now you're looking at oil prices, Brent crude only around $82 a barrel.
[03:56:15.616 --> 03:56:21.360]  It'll go to well over $130 a barrel and that'll crash economies and equity markets.
[03:56:22.281 --> 03:56:23.502]  We need peace on Earth.
[03:56:24.262 --> 03:56:29.006]  So all these little pieces of crap calling me an anti-Semite, again save it.
[03:56:29.246 --> 03:56:31.608]  I launched Occupy Peace over a decade ago.
[03:56:33.529 --> 03:56:39.434]  I'm a warrior for the Prince of Peace that you war mongers hate.
[03:56:43.550 --> 03:56:46.111]  Clown Biden calls himself the Catholic.
[03:56:47.132 --> 03:56:48.453]  I'm also a Zionist.
[03:56:49.073 --> 03:56:50.534]  What Christ do you believe in?
[03:56:51.754 --> 03:57:04.321]  Christ would love you for sending hundreds of billions of dollars of weapons to keep bloodying the killing fields in Ukraine and Gaza.
[03:57:05.642 --> 03:57:06.042]  Oh yeah.
[03:57:06.062 --> 03:57:09.104]  In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost.
[03:57:10.224 --> 03:57:11.145]  What are you kidding me?
[03:57:13.564 --> 03:57:14.864]  Where are all the religions?
[03:57:16.765 --> 03:57:22.706]  We need peace on Earth, because just as this guy is warning, World War III has begun.
[03:57:23.807 --> 03:57:34.249]  So again, go to Occupy Peace if you want to make a donation, and if you want to read history before it happens, go to jonestrends.com, jonestrends.com, you get a real bargain.

[03:57:43.746 --> 03:57:44.629]  Support InfoWallet.
[03:57:46.860 --> 03:57:52.584]  I'm not perfect and I'm under a lot of stress, but if I didn't have the supplements we have, we promote, I wouldn't be able to continue to be on air.
[03:57:53.164 --> 03:58:01.269]  And when you go to InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists in an operation that the enemy admits has been the most effective at exposing them.
[03:58:01.490 --> 03:58:03.051]  Because we're fearless and we don't back down.
[03:58:03.451 --> 03:58:04.391]  We got God on our side.
[03:58:04.732 --> 03:58:06.253]  But God needs to work through you.

[03:58:10.636 --> 03:58:11.876]  And that is a 360 win.
[03:58:12.477 --> 03:58:15.439]  Nitric Boost, without even knowing, became our number three bestseller.
[03:58:16.119 --> 03:58:17.721]  Because people loved it so much.
[03:58:17.741 --> 03:58:18.681]  They had such great effects.
[03:58:18.982 --> 03:58:25.147]  Got all these natural compounds that clean out the blood, open up your arteries and veins, the capillators, clean out your heart, your brain, everything.
[03:58:25.968 --> 03:58:27.709]  Well, we got an even better manufacturer.
[03:58:27.729 --> 03:58:32.533]  The other one was great, but one that's even better with even higher quality ingredients at a lower price.
[03:58:33.594 --> 03:58:41.183]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the globalist agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[03:58:54.678 --> 03:59:07.725]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections, masqueradings, vaccines.
[03:59:07.845 --> 03:59:16.910]  It is so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives oblivious, and you realize ignorance is not bliss, it equals death.
[03:59:18.527 --> 03:59:38.941]  But people are starting to really understand how serious things are, and that's a hard thing to do, because to wake up to a dystopic reality and realize that we're in the middle of a giant biological weapons war against humanity, and that there's mass sterilization that's already taking place, and they're cutting off all the major energy sources, is really hard to deal with, but it's the reality.
[03:59:39.521 --> 03:59:43.704]  Facing it is our only chance to turn this around, because stuff's about to get really, really nasty.
[03:59:44.104 --> 03:59:44.965]  InfoWars.com.
[03:59:48.502 --> 03:59:54.420]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
