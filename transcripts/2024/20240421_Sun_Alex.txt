[00:00:18.662 --> 00:00:19.443]  InfoWars.
[00:00:19.784 --> 00:00:20.685]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:20.985 --> 00:00:21.325]  Today.
[00:00:32.694 --> 00:00:38.946]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:07.978 --> 00:01:10.320]  Some say, well, we have to deal with our border first.
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.523]  The Ukrainian-Russian border is our border.
[00:01:15.544 --> 00:01:23.991]  It's the border between depraved autocracy and freedom-loving people seeking our democratic way of life.
[00:01:24.552 --> 00:01:26.353]  Do we have a stake in that outcome?
[00:01:26.814 --> 00:01:27.154]  Yes.
[00:01:28.595 --> 00:01:29.936]  Undeniably yes.
[00:01:31.397 --> 00:01:33.199]  Will we rise to the occasion?
[00:01:34.853 --> 00:01:54.850]  Will we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our Ukrainian brothers and sisters who for 1,151 days have been holding off the depraved, thuggish dictator Vladimir Putin who has respected no norms of warfare?
[00:01:56.055 --> 00:01:58.759]  He's targeted children in hospitals and schools.
[00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.986]  He's bombed apartment blocks, killing thousands.
[00:02:04.086 --> 00:02:04.687]  That's not true.
[00:02:08.532 --> 00:02:11.316]  Here they are, waving their Ukrainian flags, the Democrats.
[00:02:12.535 --> 00:02:16.159]  Congressman Conant, does Speaker Johnson deserve credit for how this played out?
[00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:16.779]  He does.
[00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:21.804]  Look, we came into Congress together, and he always cared about civility.
[00:02:21.864 --> 00:02:23.486]  He actually led the civility pledge.
[00:02:24.467 --> 00:02:27.330]  And we had one issue, which was give individual votes.
[00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.571]  Don't lump things together.
[00:02:29.252 --> 00:02:30.553]  And I give him credit for doing this.
[00:02:30.633 --> 00:02:34.237]  I would actually vote to table any motion to vacate him.
[00:02:34.677 --> 00:02:36.918]  You know, Chairman McCaul quoted Churchill.
[00:02:36.978 --> 00:02:42.941]  One of the things Churchill said is that America always exhausted every wrong option until doing the right thing.
[00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:46.322]  And this shows that American democracy still is very strong.
[00:02:46.462 --> 00:02:47.943]  Okay, you just said something significant.
[00:02:47.983 --> 00:02:51.185]  You said you would oppose the motion to vacate.
[00:02:51.245 --> 00:02:58.548]  In other words, you will protect Speaker Johnson's job if Marjorie Taylor Greene and the others go through with their threat to try to remove him.
[00:02:59.053 --> 00:03:00.674]  I would, through the end of the term.
[00:03:00.694 --> 00:03:05.918]  I expect Speaker Jefferson will be there in 2025.
[00:03:05.978 --> 00:03:20.230]  But look, I'm a progressive Democrat, and I think you would have a few progressive Democrats doing that, and I disagree with Speaker Johnson on many issues, and I've been very critical of him, but he did the right thing here, and he deserves to keep his job until the end of this term.
[00:03:23.752 --> 00:03:27.916]  So, Speaker Johnson is now
[00:03:29.172 --> 00:03:35.936]  We've got the Speaker for the Democratic Party with 197 days left to the most important election in world history.
[00:03:37.297 --> 00:03:41.560]  And we've got the Democrats and some Republicans waving Ukrainian flags.
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.244]  Well, Marjorie Taylor Greene posted on X a photo of flag-draped coffins that are draped with the American flag.
[00:03:48.824 --> 00:03:51.786]  That's why we fly the American flag, not the Ukrainian flag.
[00:03:52.507 --> 00:03:55.689]  House passes Ukraine funding bill on Adolf Hitler's birthday.
[00:03:56.741 --> 00:04:02.986]  Of course, their main military force, the Azov Battalions, are admitted hardcore Nazis.
[00:04:03.046 --> 00:04:14.255]  The Canadian Parliament hailed an actual SS 99-year-old officer that actually took place in massacres of Jews and Poles and others.
[00:04:15.275 --> 00:04:26.144]  One famous event where they killed 30,000 Poles and Jewish Poles and other Poles in a two-day period and put them in a giant pit in the park in one of their cities.
[00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:36.210]  He actually took part in that, and he gets a standing ovation, and they sit there and talk for like an hour about how great he fought the Russians in World War II.
[00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:43.914]  Well, we know who fought the Russians in World War II, at least if you've got 5th grade education in history you do, or I guess people don't anymore.
[00:04:43.934 --> 00:04:51.277]  For those that don't know, the Russians were the main group fighting the Nazis in World War II.
[00:04:51.297 --> 00:04:55.500]  26 million dead Russians, 24 million dead Germans, the numbers vary.
[00:04:56.604 --> 00:04:57.745]  Big broadcast line up today.
[00:04:57.765 --> 00:04:58.125]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.307 --> 00:05:03.509]  So what I really want to ask you to do is pray for myself and the crew and my family.
[00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:04.610]  That's number one.
[00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:05.391]  I want that.
[00:05:05.491 --> 00:05:05.911]  I need that.
[00:05:06.271 --> 00:05:07.312]  It's your prayer that's doing it.
[00:05:07.612 --> 00:05:08.493]  That's why this surfaced.
[00:05:08.513 --> 00:05:09.374]  That's why this happened.
[00:05:09.394 --> 00:05:10.855]  I need the prayer.
[00:05:11.856 --> 00:05:18.381]  Then I need you to take the articles, the videos, the posts we make at Real Alex Jones, recopy them, share them, post them yourself, do whatever.
[00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:19.402]  Just get it out there.
[00:05:20.242 --> 00:05:20.883]  And I need you

[00:06:06.941 --> 00:06:16.463]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:16.603 --> 00:06:19.043]  It's Sunday, April 21st, 2024.
[00:06:21.164 --> 00:06:23.364]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:06:23.384 --> 00:06:28.705]  I want to thank you all for joining us on this live Sunday transmission.
[00:06:29.385 --> 00:06:31.586]  A very interesting and extremely popular
[00:06:32.594 --> 00:06:43.482]  Young talk show host, who's here interviewing me Saturday, who's been a guest before, Jackson Hinkle, will be in studio coming up in about 30 minutes from now for the Balance of the Sunday Show.
[00:06:44.002 --> 00:06:48.005]  And then we have Sunday Night Live with Chase Geiser, 6 to 8 p.m.
[00:06:48.165 --> 00:06:52.729]  Central Standard Time, coming up this evening in a little under two hours.
[00:06:53.049 --> 00:06:53.509]  Okay.
[00:06:55.411 --> 00:06:59.734]  Congress passed the ultra-massive spending package yesterday.
[00:07:02.535 --> 00:07:30.194]  And they took time away from their normal insider trading to pass a $95.3 billion spending package with $60 billion for Ukraine, $21 billion for Israel, billions for Hamas, because that's who gets it in Gaza, so our government funding both sides as usual, and it's nine plus billion to stir up
[00:07:31.109 --> 00:07:32.449]  Conflict with China.
[00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:43.592]  So, for Southeast Asia and the South China Sea, absolutely insane.
[00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:50.533]  And there's so many clips here that it makes my head spin that are just insane.
[00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:57.535]  We have Democrats, multiple clips, representatives like Gary Conley of Virginia,
[00:07:59.309 --> 00:08:00.270]  This is a talking point.
[00:08:00.391 --> 00:08:04.136]  Several of them said this, saying, we've got to secure Ukraine's border.
[00:08:04.617 --> 00:08:05.478]  It's our border.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:15.573]  That was over a billion dollars in the overall package of the 60 billion to Ukraine to secure their border.
[00:08:16.943 --> 00:08:23.606]  Places like Belarus, but not our border, and not to stop the human trafficking and sex slavery and massive crime wave.
[00:08:24.426 --> 00:08:42.054]  It's just staggering how the deep state Democrats working with the Republican establishment, because Trump and what's the progeny of the Tea Party, has just as a beachhead the Republican Party, and is taking it over.
[00:08:42.114 --> 00:08:43.135]  I'd say the Republican Party
[00:08:44.364 --> 00:09:10.547]  is about seventy percent taken over by populist patriots but it's such narrow majority when it comes to the democrats in congress in the house that they're able to team up with the democrats and then out vote the republicans and that's what happened so the republicans were doing a pretty good job the last what three months they've been holding up the
[00:09:12.486 --> 00:09:24.892]  First it was a $200 billion bill, then it was a $60 billion bill, but after the Iran attack with those missiles a week ago, they were able to ram through, going, we've got to get Israel more missiles for their Iron Dome.
[00:09:26.032 --> 00:09:34.056]  And I'm all for Israel having missiles for their Iron Dome, but Israel per capita is way wealthier than us.
[00:09:34.796 --> 00:09:38.598]  You know, imagine if it was $30 billion for America.
[00:09:41.864 --> 00:09:46.447]  $20 billion for Israel and $30 billion for Ukraine.
[00:09:47.507 --> 00:09:58.293]  But no, it's $60 billion for Ukraine and $20-something billion for Israel and $9 billion to stir up trouble in the South China Sea.
[00:09:59.773 --> 00:10:10.539]  Not one red penny, not one cent, not one dime, with old Eisenhower on it.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.802]  Not one dime.
[00:10:16.643 --> 00:10:17.564]  Not one quarter.
[00:10:17.684 --> 00:10:18.885]  Good old George Washington on it.
[00:10:19.245 --> 00:10:20.667]  Not one Benjamin Franklin.
[00:10:20.707 --> 00:10:21.487]  Not a $100 bill.
[00:10:22.548 --> 00:10:23.189]  Zero.
[00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:24.450]  Zero.
[00:10:25.051 --> 00:10:25.571]  Zero.
[00:10:25.691 --> 00:10:26.092]  Zero.
[00:10:26.172 --> 00:10:26.512]  Zero.
[00:10:26.572 --> 00:10:26.952]  Zero.
[00:10:27.133 --> 00:10:27.533]  Zero.
[00:10:27.953 --> 00:10:28.594]  Zero forever.
[00:10:31.344 --> 00:10:32.765]  Unbelievable.
[00:10:32.785 --> 00:10:34.705]  This country is falling apart.
[00:10:34.765 --> 00:10:35.986]  Inflation is out of control.
[00:10:36.546 --> 00:10:37.746]  The border is completely dissolved.
[00:10:37.786 --> 00:10:38.866]  And it's all clouded and pivoted.
[00:10:38.886 --> 00:10:46.789]  I'm going to play a very powerful, concise five-minute video in a few minutes of a talk show host who I've been a fan of for years.
[00:10:46.809 --> 00:10:49.990]  He's been in the studio before, interviewed me, but I don't know why I never interviewed him.
[00:10:50.985 --> 00:10:55.046]  Mark Moss really concisely knocked it out of the park on Cloward and Piven.
[00:10:55.526 --> 00:10:58.467]  And of course, governments have tried to collapse things before to bring in tyranny.
[00:10:58.527 --> 00:11:08.129]  It's not like they invented this, but their plan has been adopted since the 70s, developed in the 60s, by the Democratic leadership.
[00:11:08.569 --> 00:11:15.511]  Klaus Schwab has adopted it with the WUF and the UN, and they admit they're collapsing society to build back better in the Great Reset.
[00:11:17.071 --> 00:11:20.454]  It's a big deal, but these are staggering clips, and I've got a bunch of them.
[00:11:20.615 --> 00:11:21.796]  I'm just going to play three of them.
[00:11:22.837 --> 00:11:28.622]  First, let's play, as I mentioned it, and unlike the corporate media, they'll say something about me and then never show me actually saying it.
[00:11:28.983 --> 00:11:30.604]  Or they'll show another clip that isn't me saying it.
[00:11:31.065 --> 00:11:32.666]  But I tell you something, I like to show it to you.
[00:11:33.207 --> 00:11:40.354]  So here's one of the clips, Representative Gary Connolly, a Virginia Democrat, arrogantly saying, Ukraine's border is our border, here it is.
[00:11:41.914 --> 00:11:44.255]  Some say, well, we have to deal with our border first.
[00:11:44.515 --> 00:11:48.476]  The Ukrainian-Russian border is our border.
[00:11:49.476 --> 00:11:57.918]  It's the border between depraved autocracy and freedom-loving people seeking our democratic way of life.
[00:11:58.479 --> 00:12:00.279]  Do we have a stake in that outcome?
[00:12:00.759 --> 00:12:01.079]  Yes.
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.860]  Undeniably yes.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.121]  Will we rise to the occasion?
[00:12:08.797 --> 00:12:28.831]  Will we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our Ukrainian brothers and sisters who for 1,151 days have been holding off the depraved, thuggish dictator Vladimir Putin, who has respected no norms of warfare?
[00:12:29.991 --> 00:12:32.713]  He's targeted children in hospitals and schools.
[00:12:33.274 --> 00:12:37.917]  He's bombed apartment blocks, killing thousands.
[00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:41.149]  That's not true.
[00:12:41.169 --> 00:12:43.050]  I actually looked that up when I saw that yesterday.
[00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:52.754]  It's estimated about 300 people have died from collateral damage in Ukraine, which is the craziest accuracy I've ever seen.
[00:12:53.974 --> 00:12:59.597]  The Pentagon estimates that half of the munitions being dropped on Gaza are not smart.
[00:12:59.617 --> 00:13:04.899]  I mean, they're not even going after a specific group, it's just they blow whole buildings up.
[00:13:05.359 --> 00:13:07.300]  And they're just a bomb you drop from 10,000 feet.
[00:13:09.656 --> 00:13:11.617]  That's collateral damage, though, and Israel does it.
[00:13:12.057 --> 00:13:13.258]  And I'm not even defending Russia.
[00:13:13.278 --> 00:13:14.158]  That's not my job.
[00:13:14.439 --> 00:13:15.539]  I'm an America First guy.
[00:13:15.559 --> 00:13:17.900]  But the West started this fight with the Russians.
[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:18.601]  That's on record.
[00:13:19.741 --> 00:13:20.402]  Don't believe me?
[00:13:20.442 --> 00:13:21.562]  Go look up George Soros.
[00:13:21.622 --> 00:13:25.104]  Says he engineered civil war in Ukraine.
[00:13:25.224 --> 00:13:25.764]  CNN.
[00:13:26.005 --> 00:13:26.765]  Fareed Zarkaria.
[00:13:26.785 --> 00:13:27.405]  It comes right up.
[00:13:28.346 --> 00:13:29.766]  George Soros, Fareed Zarkaria.
[00:13:32.088 --> 00:13:32.788]  Ukraine war.
[00:13:33.148 --> 00:13:35.149]  He only went on once, like, eight years ago.
[00:13:35.209 --> 00:13:36.190]  Two years after he did it.
[00:13:36.977 --> 00:13:45.567]  He said, with the State Department I got five billion and we overthrew their government and now we are causing a proxy war and I will soon be the Tsar of Russia.
[00:13:47.949 --> 00:13:52.555]  Russia has not invaded anybody since the mid-1970s when they invaded Afghanistan.
[00:13:53.916 --> 00:13:55.397]  And it's now been declassified that the U.S.
[00:13:55.417 --> 00:14:04.925]  government was funding the Afghans to start attacking into provinces outside of Afghanistan, north into areas of Russia areas, Russia-controlled areas.
[00:14:05.365 --> 00:14:07.247]  And the Russians walked into a CIA trap.
[00:14:07.287 --> 00:14:09.328]  It wasn't launched by Reagan, as the media gives him credit.
[00:14:09.708 --> 00:14:11.130]  It was Zbigniew Brzezinski and...
[00:14:12.728 --> 00:14:19.313]  Jimmy Carter that did that and that took the Taliban and Bin Laden and you know Bin Laden worked for the CIA.
[00:14:19.433 --> 00:14:19.853]  Don't believe me?
[00:14:19.873 --> 00:14:21.074]  Just type in Bin Laden worked for the CIA.
[00:14:21.094 --> 00:14:22.615]  You'll get like BBC, AP, Reuters.
[00:14:23.556 --> 00:14:24.116]  That's a fact.
[00:14:24.257 --> 00:14:29.100]  You won't get it by clicking news or click web and find the old articles but it's there.
[00:14:30.021 --> 00:14:32.222]  So my point is this is the best enemy's money can buy.
[00:14:33.603 --> 00:14:38.147]  And then Russia on the invite eight years ago, seven years ago of the Syrians
[00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:44.394]  You know, as soon as Trump got in, because Trump said, sure, I'm against, you know, ISIS, which is Al Qaeda.
[00:14:45.755 --> 00:14:46.316]  So the U.S.
[00:14:46.336 --> 00:14:47.617]  said, we're not going to attack the Russians.
[00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:53.683]  But when the Russians went in, with heavy casualties on the ground and the air, and took out ISIS over three years.
[00:14:55.404 --> 00:14:58.026]  And the Pentagon got caught behind Trump's back, aiding ISIS.
[00:14:58.046 --> 00:14:58.947]  That came out in Congress.
[00:14:59.448 --> 00:15:01.990]  Remember, Trump used to say that Obama is the father of ISIS.
[00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:02.731]  He literally is.
[00:15:03.615 --> 00:15:08.299]  In front of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Arab Spring, I mean all of that was our government.
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:15.586]  Blowing up churches, taking over our allies in Egypt, working with radical Islam just like the left does today.
[00:15:15.726 --> 00:15:22.732]  So it's not that I'm against Israel, I'm against funding both sides and then bringing all the Islamists here for further destabilization.
[00:15:22.752 --> 00:15:28.898]  There's a larger plan going on and I'm not just looking at it as one side's good, one side's bad.
[00:15:30.404 --> 00:15:36.910]  The globalists are funding both sides, and now Moscow has issued a dire warning after the Ukraine aid bill of 60-plus billion dollars, saying this is terrorism.
[00:15:38.451 --> 00:15:45.038]  Ukraine's been launching thousands of drone attacks on our civilian cities and killing thousands of Russians and civilians.
[00:15:45.058 --> 00:15:46.959]  It's the other way around from what the congressman said.
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.342]  And we're going to really start getting serious when you do that.
[00:15:51.363 --> 00:15:56.008]  So we're just marching towards World War III, and I would really like to not see that happen.
[00:15:58.075 --> 00:15:59.735]  Now here's the next chilling clip.
[00:16:00.496 --> 00:16:03.496]  And this is another congressman.
[00:16:06.817 --> 00:16:10.718]  This is Representative Khanna.
[00:16:12.458 --> 00:16:15.959]  Tells John Carl that he would vote to support Speaker Mike Johnson.
[00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:22.701]  Republicans try to remove him for securing Ukrainian aid, which they admit, most of it gets laundered back
[00:16:23.922 --> 00:16:26.383]  To the Democratic Party and then some Republicans.
[00:16:26.483 --> 00:16:31.564]  I mean, don't think for a minute that the Republican leadership... I mean, Johnson's turned out to be as bad as I thought he was.
[00:16:31.604 --> 00:16:38.126]  I mean, he looks like a Chucky doll with black hair.
[00:16:38.146 --> 00:16:41.047]  I mean, he just radiates devil energy to me.
[00:16:41.067 --> 00:16:46.568]  I don't know how anybody can't look at Governor Newsom, and not just his actions, but the way he looks.
[00:16:46.648 --> 00:16:47.808]  I mean, my skin crawls.
[00:16:48.129 --> 00:16:52.930]  You see the evil coming out of me when somebody walks around.
[00:16:54.181 --> 00:16:54.621]  All the time?
[00:16:54.641 --> 00:16:56.002]  I mean, you got a problem.
[00:16:56.983 --> 00:16:59.084]  Holy Spirit in me goes, danger, Will Robinson.
[00:17:00.085 --> 00:17:03.487]  And nothing against Joel Steven.
[00:17:03.527 --> 00:17:04.388]  I mean, I get the same thing.
[00:17:04.428 --> 00:17:05.028]  I watch that guy.
[00:17:05.048 --> 00:17:05.809]  My skin crawls.
[00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:09.111]  Hillary Clinton really does with that big demon face she makes.
[00:17:09.131 --> 00:17:10.592]  I mean, I can't even make the face.
[00:17:10.632 --> 00:17:11.352]  I'm not demon possessed.
[00:17:11.372 --> 00:17:18.697]  And then you've got Brian Stelter, really almost broke the meter on demon energy.
[00:17:20.278 --> 00:17:22.960]  But then there's the actions that come out of these people.
[00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:27.833]  And that's really why you know they're evil, you judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:17:27.853 --> 00:17:37.341]  But here he is saying that basically Speaker Johnson is now the Democrat Party Speaker and they're going to override any Republican votes now and vote for him.
[00:17:38.802 --> 00:17:46.389]  And they win either way because the Republicans are going to get pissed, and Marjorie Taylor Greene and others have been proven right, are going to vacate the chair and remove him soon.
[00:17:46.409 --> 00:17:47.630]  I predict the next month.
[00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:52.354]  And then he will leave just like his predecessor just quit.
[00:17:54.281 --> 00:17:59.086]  Kevin McCarthy and all these other Republicans, like 15, 16 Republicans have quit in the last year alone.
[00:17:59.806 --> 00:18:03.650]  They got one more person in the majority, and then it goes the Democrats.
[00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:10.897]  So they'll have the House by supporting Johnson, who you better believes just got some special stock picks.
[00:18:11.658 --> 00:18:12.578]  He's about to make $100 million.
[00:18:13.099 --> 00:18:17.523]  It's like the Attorney General of New York went into office worth $30,000.
[00:18:17.643 --> 00:18:17.963]  Look it up.
[00:18:20.123 --> 00:18:20.984]  I'd like somebody to tell me
[00:18:43.154 --> 00:18:46.516]  How Dan Crenshaw went to Congress with no money and is now worth massive amounts.
[00:18:46.536 --> 00:18:47.396]  I mean, it's all the same.
[00:18:47.857 --> 00:18:50.418]  Remember 15 years ago, Congress got in trouble for insider trading?
[00:18:51.018 --> 00:18:53.440]  So they passed a law to insider trade.
[00:18:54.981 --> 00:19:05.347]  As long as they disclose on a form that comes out a month after the trade, when no one else can use the information, as long as they disclose, they're allowed to do it.
[00:19:05.367 --> 00:19:07.728]  It's like a license to kill.
[00:19:07.748 --> 00:19:11.170]  As long as I tell you later I did something wrong, it's okay.
[00:19:13.007 --> 00:19:19.008]  So I'm going to say this again, I'm going to play this clip.
[00:19:19.028 --> 00:19:20.709]  95.3 billion dollars.
[00:19:24.409 --> 00:19:41.073]  When this country, for the general average person, because I've got a lot of family that have multiple college degrees, basically they all do, and most of them are veterans, and they work for power companies, and they work for school districts, and they
[00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:47.807]  They work in law enforcement and they work in, you name it, professional jobs.
[00:19:48.867 --> 00:19:54.490]  And I have a big family on both sides and I see them all three or four times a year.
[00:19:55.511 --> 00:19:59.153]  And I'll talk to them and they come to dinner for like an hour and a half.
[00:19:59.193 --> 00:20:00.673]  They go, sorry, I got to go to work.
[00:20:02.815 --> 00:20:03.535]  And I go, where are you going?
[00:20:03.575 --> 00:20:04.796]  Oh, I got a second job.
[00:20:06.056 --> 00:20:07.157]  We own a gas station.
[00:20:08.562 --> 00:20:10.043]  You're like, how much do you make?
[00:20:10.103 --> 00:20:13.604]  Not much, but it allows us to go on trips and save some money.
[00:20:14.624 --> 00:20:15.424]  But that's how they are.
[00:20:15.444 --> 00:20:20.646]  I mean, they love working 14 hours a day, but they weren't doing that 5 years ago, 10 years ago.
[00:20:20.666 --> 00:20:30.649]  And all of my family, including family that are doctors, not my dad, other family that's doctors, have to work 60 hours a week.
[00:20:32.947 --> 00:20:39.334]  I mean, unless you're some rock star plastic surgeon or some brain surgeon, you know, the top surgeons, they can command whatever they want.
[00:20:39.354 --> 00:20:41.136]  Those guys are making 10 million bucks a year.
[00:20:41.556 --> 00:20:52.347]  But the average dentist, the average doctor, the average MD is making a few hundred grand a year and you know their liability insurance is like 30 grand a year and there's all the other expenses and everything else.
[00:20:52.468 --> 00:20:54.690]  Most doctors don't even start making money until they're 35.
[00:20:57.349 --> 00:20:58.630]  Paying off the student loans.
[00:20:59.451 --> 00:21:03.394]  So all I'm saying is I don't need to read the news that tells the economy's great.
[00:21:03.794 --> 00:21:04.654]  I talk to people on the street.
[00:21:04.815 --> 00:21:05.315]  I look at the numbers.
[00:21:05.335 --> 00:21:05.995]  You're out there listening.
[00:21:06.015 --> 00:21:06.936]  You're like, yeah, yeah, we hear you.
[00:21:07.737 --> 00:21:10.479]  And all of my family is working more than they've ever worked.
[00:21:12.901 --> 00:21:15.883]  And they've got college degrees and honorable discharges.
[00:21:17.424 --> 00:21:18.225]  And they're managers.
[00:21:19.946 --> 00:21:21.327]  And they've all got two jobs at least.
[00:21:23.663 --> 00:21:25.604]  And that's not counting the other jobs they do.
[00:21:25.624 --> 00:21:35.828]  We have a family farm, family ranches, and running cows and planting Christmas trees just pays the taxes.
[00:21:37.729 --> 00:21:42.031]  And so sometimes they're up at 10 o'clock at night baling hay and they love it.
[00:21:43.011 --> 00:21:43.492]  God love them.
[00:21:43.592 --> 00:21:46.233]  But the point is, you compare that
[00:21:48.609 --> 00:22:11.347]  When they're driving around, you know, with the tractor and his lights on, to the average millennial sitting around with their thumb up their rear end, and when the, you can criticize boomers all day, but a lot of them are lazy, a lot of them are hard working, and then the people right behind the boomers, Gen Xers, I'm seeing the statistics, I'm not saying everybody young is bad, but the numbers are clear.
[00:22:12.403 --> 00:22:15.765]  The Millennials are the most lazy generation ever seen.
[00:22:16.366 --> 00:22:18.047]  They have no aspiration on average.
[00:22:18.487 --> 00:22:19.068]  Some are great.
[00:22:21.649 --> 00:22:25.952]  And you get into the Gen Z people, and I mean, it's just a freak show.
[00:22:27.794 --> 00:22:29.074]  An absolute freak show.
[00:22:29.655 --> 00:22:30.715]  No connection reality.
[00:22:31.076 --> 00:22:33.718]  I mean, I remember being like 12 years old, saying, I want a new pair of tennis shoes.
[00:22:33.738 --> 00:22:35.118]  My dad said, get up and get a job.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.882]  And I remember, about 12 years old, sitting at the Easy Mart.
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.061]  He was pumping gas.
[00:22:42.101 --> 00:22:43.983]  He said, go in and get me a coffee and blah, blah, blah.
[00:22:44.003 --> 00:22:45.485]  We're going to go out on the boat or something.
[00:22:46.346 --> 00:22:48.669]  My dad said, if you want new tennis shoes, you need to get a job.
[00:22:48.689 --> 00:22:51.572]  So he bought me like two pairs of shoes a year, which is great.
[00:22:51.952 --> 00:22:53.274]  Looking back on it, because I had to figure stuff out.
[00:22:53.294 --> 00:22:54.475]  I remember going to my dad.
[00:22:55.336 --> 00:22:56.578]  So I've been reading the newspaper back then.
[00:22:56.598 --> 00:22:58.860]  I go, well, actually, there's child labor laws.
[00:22:59.081 --> 00:22:59.762]  He laughed.
[00:23:00.814 --> 00:23:03.215]  And he said, well, I don't think it precludes that.
[00:23:03.235 --> 00:23:04.856]  And about a day later he goes, I looked it up, you're right.
[00:23:04.896 --> 00:23:06.096]  He goes, you won the $100 bet.
[00:23:06.116 --> 00:23:07.177]  I had a $100 bet with him.
[00:23:08.297 --> 00:23:09.418]  But he said, now here's your $100.
[00:23:09.678 --> 00:23:11.599]  But he said, you're really in trouble now.
[00:23:12.759 --> 00:23:13.940]  And I said, I don't know how to get a job.
[00:23:15.051 --> 00:23:26.483]  So he put me in the car and drove to the marina in the neighborhood, speaking of boats, marches me into the old World War II bed or whatever it was, wasn't that old then, behind the counter, and goes, my son, he's learning how to work.
[00:23:27.064 --> 00:23:27.965]  Will you hire him here?
[00:23:27.985 --> 00:23:29.607]  And he goes, yeah, I'll hire him for minimum wage.
[00:23:29.647 --> 00:23:32.129]  You say so, Mr. Jones, blah, blah, blah.
[00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:34.172]  How many days a week do you want to work?
[00:23:34.192 --> 00:23:36.134]  Well, I want him to work after school, you know, during the
[00:23:37.619 --> 00:23:38.079]  I don't know.
[00:24:01.954 --> 00:24:03.656]  Seeing a kid work and they're like, hey, who are you?
[00:24:03.676 --> 00:24:04.356]  Who are your parents?
[00:24:04.576 --> 00:24:05.337]  You want a job?
[00:24:05.357 --> 00:24:06.538]  You want to come mow my yard?
[00:24:06.898 --> 00:24:08.580]  Then all of a sudden I was mowing people's yards.
[00:24:10.361 --> 00:24:13.224]  And see, that's why I know people that have worked know this.
[00:24:13.244 --> 00:24:15.145]  You're like, why are you telling me something we already know?
[00:24:15.586 --> 00:24:17.648]  Because a lot of people don't know this, folks.
[00:24:19.449 --> 00:24:24.914]  A lot of people... Speak of the devil, that's my middle daughter calling me.
[00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:28.331]  They don't know how this works.
[00:24:28.391 --> 00:24:34.378]  Like, you don't just go get a minimum wage job, you go get it, and when you work hard, you get promoted.
[00:24:34.398 --> 00:24:45.049]  I remember, I only had a few fast food jobs, and the reason I quit them was, within two months of the two fast food jobs I had, I had three, every time
[00:24:46.087 --> 00:24:48.148]  Within two months, I was the manager.
[00:24:48.168 --> 00:24:52.951]  Oh, I was getting double the money, but it meant they wanted 60, 70 hours a week.
[00:24:53.671 --> 00:24:59.095]  And when you're 17, 18, bossing around 25-year-olds, it doesn't go well.
[00:25:00.335 --> 00:25:08.860]  And I didn't like telling people to get their asses in gear and pay attention at the ice cream shop and the two hamburger places I work.
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:10.641]  But I'm digressing, and I'm sorry.
[00:25:11.262 --> 00:25:13.343]  You know, as you get older, you get more and more nostalgic.
[00:25:15.307 --> 00:25:19.751]  But the only bad part about working in the marina was, that's when I started drinking at 12.
[00:25:20.831 --> 00:25:25.475]  Because the old World War II vets, there was a couple of them that managed it, and I guess they owned it.
[00:25:26.756 --> 00:25:28.177]  They were always giving me curse lights.
[00:25:28.618 --> 00:25:29.919]  Wow, you worked really hard!
[00:25:29.979 --> 00:25:32.781]  You just cleaned 14 boats today, boy!
[00:25:33.562 --> 00:25:35.383]  Get over here and have a curse light with me!
[00:25:38.065 --> 00:25:40.467]  Then it'd be like, I'm going fishing at 5 a.m.
[00:25:40.487 --> 00:25:42.749]  tomorrow, I'm gonna catch catfish, you ready to go?
[00:25:44.375 --> 00:25:46.376]  And man, it's the coolest thing hanging out with those old men.
[00:25:48.817 --> 00:25:49.437]  But then it's 5 a.m.
[00:25:49.457 --> 00:25:50.957]  and they're trying to get you to drink Kurzweil.
[00:25:52.518 --> 00:25:53.938]  So, I don't know.
[00:25:53.978 --> 00:25:55.559]  Some will say it's good to shelter your children.
[00:25:55.579 --> 00:25:57.480]  Of course, I looked like I was 15 when I was 12.
[00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:58.960]  I'm done talking about that.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:08.204]  Let's go to this disgusting, traitorous clip of them openly saying Mike Johnson's on by the Democrats and they're going to outvote the Republicans now.
[00:26:08.624 --> 00:26:11.085]  This makes McCarthy look like an angel cake.
[00:26:11.345 --> 00:26:11.685]  Here it is.
[00:26:12.759 --> 00:26:16.522]  Congressman Conant, does Speaker Johnson deserve credit for how this played out?
[00:26:16.742 --> 00:26:17.142]  He does.
[00:26:17.302 --> 00:26:22.146]  Look, we came into Congress together, and he always cared about civility.
[00:26:22.166 --> 00:26:23.907]  He actually led the civility pledge.
[00:26:24.828 --> 00:26:27.690]  And we had one issue, which was give individual votes.
[00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:28.931]  Don't lump things together.
[00:26:29.611 --> 00:26:30.912]  And I give him credit for doing this.
[00:26:30.992 --> 00:26:34.615]  I would actually vote to table any motion to vacate him.
[00:26:35.035 --> 00:26:37.277]  You know, Chairman McCaul quoted Churchill.
[00:26:37.337 --> 00:26:43.342]  One of the things Churchill said is that America always exhausted every wrong option until doing the right thing.
[00:26:43.822 --> 00:26:46.685]  And this shows that American democracy still is very strong.
[00:26:46.825 --> 00:26:48.326]  Okay, you just said something significant.
[00:26:48.346 --> 00:26:51.569]  You said you would oppose the table, the motion to vacate.
[00:26:51.629 --> 00:26:58.915]  In other words, you will protect Speaker Johnson's job if Marjorie Taylor Greene and the others go through with their threat to try to remove him.
[00:26:59.409 --> 00:27:00.950]  I would, through the end of the term.
[00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:06.273]  I expect Speaker Jefferson will be there in 2025.
[00:27:06.333 --> 00:27:20.482]  But look, I'm a progressive Democrat, and I think you would have a few progressive Democrats doing that, and I disagree with Speaker Johnson on many issues, and I've been very critical of him, but he did the right thing here, and he deserves to keep his job until the end of this term.
[00:27:29.605 --> 00:27:31.708]  Not blinders on us, but it is like blinders.
[00:27:31.768 --> 00:27:34.811]  Ignore all the stuff that doesn't matter and focus on what is important.
[00:27:35.172 --> 00:27:36.053]  And we are loaded for bear.
[00:27:36.073 --> 00:27:42.080]  We got a special guest, Jackson Hinkle, coming in the studio and we've got the waterfront to cover here.
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:46.145]  But what a spectacularly disgusting clip.
[00:27:47.662 --> 00:27:48.162]  And you heard him.
[00:27:48.222 --> 00:27:51.365]  Yeah, and now the Republicans will be so pissed, we'll lose the House.
[00:27:51.985 --> 00:27:52.746]  No, don't be pissed.
[00:27:52.766 --> 00:27:53.806]  Go vote for MAGA.
[00:27:53.846 --> 00:27:54.867]  Go vote for Patriots.
[00:27:55.227 --> 00:27:56.888]  We're getting more and more good people each time.
[00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:58.229]  It's a process.
[00:27:58.309 --> 00:27:58.850]  We're winning.
[00:27:58.930 --> 00:27:59.590]  We're on the march.
[00:28:00.971 --> 00:28:04.654]  And we're revealing the stuff that's happening.
[00:28:04.694 --> 00:28:10.518]  But Speaker Johnson, on a satanic scale, just when I look at him, is about an 8 out of 10.
[00:28:14.059 --> 00:28:14.801]  That's saying a lot.
[00:28:14.841 --> 00:28:16.104]  I mean, Newsom's like a nine.
[00:28:16.585 --> 00:28:17.788]  Hillary's about a nine and a half.
[00:28:19.233 --> 00:28:22.715]  Because it shines through so bad on... Brian Stelter's about a 9.5.
[00:28:22.835 --> 00:28:24.536]  It's the highest we've seen.
[00:28:25.376 --> 00:28:26.637]  That guy's a walking demon.
[00:28:27.257 --> 00:28:27.878]  Poltergeist.
[00:28:28.658 --> 00:28:31.880]  He's a star in the new Exorcist movie.
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.361]  And then you've got people like Hillary.
[00:28:34.661 --> 00:28:35.642]  She's a 10.7.
[00:28:35.962 --> 00:28:38.103]  She actually breaks the scale.
[00:28:38.824 --> 00:28:41.825]  But we're going to get serious and come back with our guests and plow through it all today.
[00:28:41.865 --> 00:28:45.187]  But hey, $90 billion for other countries and war and death.
[00:28:45.827 --> 00:28:46.828]  Nothing for our veterans.
[00:28:47.028 --> 00:28:47.949]  Nothing for our people.
[00:28:48.869 --> 00:28:49.649]  Nothing but pain.
[00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:51.770]  Yep, we're getting gang rape.
[00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:53.350]  Stay with us, mfulwars.com.

[00:29:17.998 --> 00:29:18.218]  Yeah!
[00:29:34.653 --> 00:29:35.053]  I think so.
[00:30:00.009 --> 00:30:05.454]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[00:30:06.215 --> 00:30:10.499]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners, and because it's so hard to produce.
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:15.284]  We finally have a limited run, back in supply, at infowarestore.com.
[00:30:16.705 --> 00:30:19.467]  So many people have serious issues.
[00:30:19.747 --> 00:30:20.888]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[00:30:21.328 --> 00:30:26.732]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[00:30:27.292 --> 00:30:32.715]  Most other iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[00:30:33.316 --> 00:30:36.078]  But this is pure atomic certified
[00:30:37.941 --> 00:30:39.181]  I don't know.

[00:33:01.027 --> 00:33:06.971]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:11.133 --> 00:33:14.015]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, the U.S.
[00:33:14.075 --> 00:33:22.340]  resistance against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:25.282]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[00:33:25.302 --> 00:33:26.763]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[00:33:27.103 --> 00:33:29.005]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[00:33:29.245 --> 00:33:31.347]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[00:33:31.607 --> 00:33:32.668]  This is all confirmed.
[00:33:32.688 --> 00:33:33.629]  This is not a drill.
[00:33:33.789 --> 00:33:37.732]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[00:33:38.073 --> 00:33:39.494]  They've officially become state-run.
[00:33:39.594 --> 00:33:40.075]  Apple 100%.
[00:33:40.475 --> 00:33:46.100]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:51.583]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[00:33:51.623 --> 00:33:52.483]  This is happening.
[00:33:52.503 --> 00:34:00.448]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[00:34:00.508 --> 00:34:06.471]  Now, this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[00:34:06.891 --> 00:34:14.856]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion, paradigm manipulation.
[00:34:16.141 --> 00:34:19.083]  They are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[00:34:19.143 --> 00:34:22.584]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[00:34:22.664 --> 00:34:29.928]  And now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[00:34:30.148 --> 00:34:32.810]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:37.932]  Total Internet of Things integration, global social score, complete command and control system.
[00:34:38.393 --> 00:34:41.074]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system.
[00:34:41.374 --> 00:34:54.106]  Now attacking the United States with traitors inside the major security agencies, blocking Trump's resistance of the program, and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles of the Chi-Com slash Big Tech banking combine emergency situation.
[00:34:54.406 --> 00:34:59.591]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[00:35:00.672 --> 00:35:09.378]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception, where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[00:35:09.418 --> 00:35:14.322]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[00:35:14.682 --> 00:35:19.586]  I'm a person that cares about life and children, and is against these wars, and so they make me a herder of children.
[00:35:19.906 --> 00:35:27.152]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[00:35:27.172 --> 00:35:34.838]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they now use me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[00:35:34.958 --> 00:35:40.643]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you.
[00:35:40.883 --> 00:35:45.506]  Only your full understanding of this TE will break you free from this paradigm.
[00:35:45.526 --> 00:35:47.688]  I have given you the transmission!
[00:35:47.868 --> 00:35:48.689]  Now break free!
[00:35:52.473 --> 00:36:01.384]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:36:01.624 --> 00:36:03.026]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:36:03.546 --> 00:36:08.492]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:35.348]  Well, in the last three years, Jackson Hinkle has exploded onto the scene, reaching tens of millions of people a day, and with more ex-followers than I have.
[00:36:35.388 --> 00:36:42.695]  You can find him as Jackson Hinkle, like the German bomber, on X. Man, we've got a lot.
[00:36:42.735 --> 00:36:43.917]  I want to cover a lot of news with you.
[00:36:43.937 --> 00:36:45.858]  You're taking a whole host of subjects.
[00:36:45.879 --> 00:36:47.320]  You interviewed me Saturday.
[00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:49.062]  It's great to have you here.
[00:36:49.402 --> 00:36:50.023]  When is that going to air?
[00:36:50.868 --> 00:36:57.731]  I think in about two, three days we'll have it up on X and Rumble and it was a great conversation, so I'm looking forward to it.
[00:36:57.951 --> 00:37:00.492]  Well, you're a good interviewer, unlike me, you let people talk.
[00:37:01.292 --> 00:37:02.632]  What do you want to tackle first?
[00:37:02.652 --> 00:37:06.454]  A lot of people know who you are, some people watching or listening on radio stations may not know.
[00:37:07.454 --> 00:37:10.895]  You've been on air three years, you've exploded, you've reached like 10 million people a day, I would say conservatively.
[00:37:10.915 --> 00:37:13.196]  I've been watching you for a while, you've been on as a guest before.
[00:37:14.117 --> 00:37:15.037]  What makes you tick?
[00:37:15.237 --> 00:37:17.638]  You've got very eclectic political views as well.
[00:37:18.766 --> 00:37:21.447]  Well, foreign policy has always been an interest of mine.
[00:37:21.467 --> 00:37:27.188]  There's no reason why we should be spending billions of dollars on these wars when our country's falling apart.
[00:37:27.728 --> 00:37:38.531]  But I think just over the course of the Biden administration, it's gotten so bad, so violent, so bloody that people all across the country have woken up to the truth.
[00:37:38.851 --> 00:37:44.333]  And that's why there's been this surge in, I guess, people looking for that sort of content.
[00:37:44.933 --> 00:37:52.719]  Overall, multi-polarity, foreign policy, ending the wars, and ending this illegal surveillance state that is now coming after you.
[00:37:53.099 --> 00:37:56.682]  We saw the CIA this week coming after you in the leaked footage.
[00:37:56.862 --> 00:37:57.442]  That was crazy.
[00:37:58.843 --> 00:38:00.424]  And I knew that all along.
[00:38:01.705 --> 00:38:08.871]  The chief counsel of the FBI admitted he initiated all this psychological warfare operation against me.
[00:38:09.751 --> 00:38:11.212]  And so I'm just honored they did it.
[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:16.121]  Yeah, they always admit the truth.
[00:38:16.162 --> 00:38:19.644]  I was just listening to the end of that Tucker Carlson episode on Joe Rogan.
[00:38:19.664 --> 00:38:20.885]  Huge interview.
[00:38:20.925 --> 00:38:23.927]  Yeah, I mean it was crazy what he said about you.
[00:38:23.987 --> 00:38:31.172]  It's true what he said about you, but also it was very interesting what he said about the deep-sea coup against Richard Nixon.
[00:38:31.313 --> 00:38:33.114]  Most popular president since George Washington.
[00:38:33.274 --> 00:38:34.455]  Yes, yes.
[00:38:34.475 --> 00:38:35.996]  And it 100% was a deep state coup.
[00:38:36.016 --> 00:38:37.718]  But he had like 69% of the vote.
[00:38:37.838 --> 00:38:38.599]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:38.659 --> 00:38:40.180]  Black people, white people, they all loved him.
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:40.620]  Yeah.
[00:38:41.181 --> 00:38:43.002]  And everyone knows what happens.
[00:38:43.082 --> 00:38:49.888]  He was, you know, he was making peace all around the world with countries, well not all around the world, but with countries like China, for example.
[00:38:50.669 --> 00:38:52.831]  And he was doing things that the deep state didn't like.
[00:38:52.931 --> 00:38:54.012]  And the economy was roaring.
[00:38:54.172 --> 00:38:57.675]  And within six months of him out of office, they tanked the economy.
[00:38:58.135 --> 00:38:58.395]  Mm-hmm.
[00:38:59.015 --> 00:39:04.876]  They tanked the economy and then they went on to start even more wars and continue the wars and do all that.
[00:39:05.637 --> 00:39:07.677]  And, you know, he was an outsider.
[00:39:07.757 --> 00:39:09.437]  He came from a poor family.
[00:39:09.577 --> 00:39:12.218]  He came from Whittier, California, I think it was.
[00:39:12.238 --> 00:39:13.218]  Absolutely.
[00:39:13.238 --> 00:39:13.778]  Farmers.
[00:39:14.178 --> 00:39:15.839]  Yeah, he was an outsider, 100%.
[00:39:16.479 --> 00:39:18.059]  You see that again with Donald Trump today.
[00:39:18.099 --> 00:39:19.559]  They just cannot tolerate that.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:24.720]  Well, he thought he was really the president and he worked 18 hours a day and was smarter than them.
[00:39:25.201 --> 00:39:25.861]  They didn't like that.
[00:39:26.161 --> 00:39:27.001]  He was not an Ivy Leaguer.
[00:39:28.112 --> 00:39:28.732]  No, no.
[00:39:28.992 --> 00:39:33.213]  But he was very intelligent, and he was surrounded by intelligent men.
[00:39:33.273 --> 00:39:40.734]  I mean, Henry Kissinger's On China is one of the most thorough books I've ever read about, you know, U.S.-Chinese relations, Chinese diplomacy.
[00:39:41.454 --> 00:39:45.595]  And, I mean, you just don't see statesmen like that in the White House anymore.
[00:39:45.615 --> 00:39:48.536]  And by the way, as bad as Kissinger was in ways, he was smart.
[00:39:48.996 --> 00:39:50.856]  He said the Ukraine war should end two years ago.
[00:39:51.836 --> 00:39:53.496]  He said, we're not going to win this without World War III.
[00:39:53.516 --> 00:39:53.617]  Yeah.
[00:39:54.017 --> 00:39:56.037]  You don't want to go there, so just take it off the table.
[00:39:56.477 --> 00:39:59.539]  Yeah, I think there's a good distinction there.
[00:39:59.579 --> 00:40:07.325]  I mean, he thought he was doing everything for the best of the United States, and sometimes that landed us in very bloody conflicts that we probably didn't need to be in.
[00:40:07.385 --> 00:40:13.629]  But you can't take away that he was an extremely intelligent man, and that even lasted until he was like a hundred years old.
[00:40:14.029 --> 00:40:19.373]  And he knew the only way to win is nuclear war, and then no one wins, so he said, stop it now in Ukraine.
[00:40:20.734 --> 00:40:23.776]  There's a threat continuation ladder, and we're going up it towards total war.
[00:40:25.137 --> 00:40:26.978]  And they go, oh, you're a traitor, you don't want war with Russia.
[00:40:27.098 --> 00:40:28.039]  It has to stop.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:30.640]  I think they're okay with that.
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:42.388]  I mean, we saw the Anglos, we saw the Dulles brothers, George Bush family fund the rise of Hitler, and with the goal of taking out the Russian Empire and wiping out Russian society.
[00:40:42.448 --> 00:40:47.991]  So when you look at the people that came before the current generation of politicians, it's not surprising what they're doing.
[00:40:49.152 --> 00:40:52.094]  By the way, you show your knowledge of history, which most people don't have.
[00:40:52.967 --> 00:40:57.011]  Putin calls them the Anglos, because that's the name of the group.
[00:40:57.031 --> 00:41:00.153]  It doesn't mean white people, it's the Anglo-American Empire.
[00:41:00.213 --> 00:41:01.675]  That's Churchill's name for it.
[00:41:02.575 --> 00:41:06.979]  And when Putin talks, he calls it directly out, and that's where we are.
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:08.320]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:08.581 --> 00:41:10.222]  And it's 100% where we are.
[00:41:10.242 --> 00:41:13.885]  It's the City of London and Wall Street funding all of this madness.
[00:41:15.851 --> 00:41:19.774]  History hasn't changed a whole lot from the end of World War II, you know?
[00:41:19.794 --> 00:41:26.239]  At the end of World War II, Stalin was worried that the United States was going to drop the bomb on the Soviet Union.
[00:41:26.299 --> 00:41:33.865]  So he sent the elite Soviet paratroopers to the west of the Soviet Union for a potential invasion of the United States down through Alaska.
[00:41:34.806 --> 00:41:37.608]  And history really hasn't changed all that much since then.
[00:41:38.148 --> 00:41:38.969]  It's the same goals.
[00:41:41.494 --> 00:41:42.874]  What do you really think of Putin?
[00:41:42.934 --> 00:41:46.195]  Because they're genuinely mad at him, because like Nixon, he's actually the leader.
[00:41:47.235 --> 00:41:59.158]  He's been very, very restrained, but they're getting more and more enraged with him, trying to push him, I guess, by the terror attack at the theater, the Crocus Theater and the rest of it.
[00:41:59.178 --> 00:42:04.119]  They're trying to push him by triggering hardline Russians to try to force him into a wider war.
[00:42:04.139 --> 00:42:05.919]  I think he's been extremely restrained.
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.040]  That's exactly what it is.
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:15.724]  I mean, they all know that if they get rid of Putin, you're just going to have someone that's more of a hardline, anti-Western figure that rises to power.
[00:42:15.764 --> 00:42:24.527]  I mean, you can look at Dmitry Medvedev, the former president of Russia, and that guy is like Putin's rabid dog's spokesman.
[00:42:24.587 --> 00:42:28.068]  He's very anti-West in his tone.
[00:42:28.889 --> 00:42:32.610]  And, you know, Putin is a guy that tried to join the EU.
[00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:34.211]  He's a guy that tried to join NATO.
[00:42:34.731 --> 00:42:37.454]  Yeah, like they say, oh he's evil because he went to the WU effort.
[00:42:37.775 --> 00:42:38.536]  He went to the power.
[00:42:38.816 --> 00:42:41.119]  He tried to get Russia into the system.
[00:42:41.259 --> 00:42:41.960]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:42.801]  He said that in speeches.
[00:42:42.821 --> 00:42:44.002]  He said, I've tried to work with you.
[00:42:44.322 --> 00:42:45.243]  We've got all these resources.
[00:42:45.263 --> 00:42:46.064]  All he wants is war.
[00:42:46.465 --> 00:42:46.665]  Yeah.
[00:42:46.885 --> 00:42:48.087]  And you want to cut our son's dicks off.
[00:42:49.894 --> 00:43:08.829]  You can look back to the Munich speech he gave like in 2010, I think it was 2008-2010 where he was talking about, he was talking to all the world leaders in the front row, you know, you had chancellors, presidents, France, Germany there, and he was essentially just warning them that this is the path you're taking us down, we don't have to go down this path, we could go down a peaceful path.
[00:43:09.449 --> 00:43:12.170]  But I think Putin is an extremely intelligent man.
[00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:16.011]  You know, he's part of the KGB, and everyone knows the Soviet Union.
[00:43:16.631 --> 00:43:30.635]  If you were part of the KGB, you were the smartest, you were the most well-read, and he learned German in six months, completely fluent, learned the accent, everything, and then went on to become the, you know, he is the kingpin of the
[00:43:31.275 --> 00:43:31.836]  Well, let's be clear.
[00:43:57.051 --> 00:44:01.854]  The puppets like Biden that can't find their ass in both hands is because the globalists want a puppet to blame.
[00:44:02.334 --> 00:44:12.741]  The groups above it promote liberal silliness because they want us weak, because they want to conquer us, who they already think they control, so they can export that Satanism to weaken everybody else around the world.
[00:44:13.201 --> 00:44:15.242]  So people look at the West and go, God, it's poison.
[00:44:15.322 --> 00:44:20.345]  Well, yeah, it's poison in the fangs of the cobra, ready to be injected into the rest of the world.
[00:44:20.805 --> 00:44:23.147]  America, if you look at how communists operated,
[00:44:23.707 --> 00:44:27.430]  You know, first they demoralize and they destabilize and they take over.
[00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:31.292]  And then once they take over, they exploit the country they have against the next country.
[00:44:31.772 --> 00:44:35.155]  America now is nothing but a cobra with loaded fangs against the world.
[00:44:35.735 --> 00:44:37.776]  So we look at how horrible it is and see what's happening.
[00:44:37.796 --> 00:44:42.820]  Well, yeah, we're being set up as a snake to attack and bite everybody else.
[00:44:44.701 --> 00:45:09.881]  Well, I mean, each country's a different scenario, but I think you look at the Russian Empire, and I mean, there was no reason for them to be continuing their operations alongside the British in World War I. The country was in shambles, it was a feudal society, you had all these prostitution running rampant, and then you had the emperor that was still preaching Christianity, and the communists came in and they said, we're gonna actually put the Word of God into practice.
[00:45:10.261 --> 00:45:13.664]  And that's why the people united around them, and that's why they were so successful, but
[00:45:14.564 --> 00:45:14.885]  I think so.
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:33.480]  We're good to go.
[00:46:00.776 --> 00:46:03.597]  Well Jackson, that's where we disagree.
[00:46:04.617 --> 00:46:25.204]  You know a lot of history, but if I look at communism and Karl Marx and Lenin and Engels and the rest of it, feudalism was ending around the world and actually the big British intelligence, the banks, funded communism and used it to take out the czars.
[00:46:25.224 --> 00:46:26.264]  They had the train of gold.
[00:46:27.981 --> 00:46:28.261]  I think so.
[00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:51.090]  I don't know.
[00:47:10.993 --> 00:47:26.177]  From Marx and Engels being promoted by British intelligence, and it was the British that funded and they sent, you know, 100,000 plus Russian-Americans who were mainly Jewish, this is a historical fact, over there in 1917 to overthrow the Tsar.
[00:47:26.557 --> 00:47:29.458]  So I'm not defending the white Russians or what the Tsars were doing.
[00:47:30.555 --> 00:47:32.296]  How do you square that up?
[00:47:54.073 --> 00:48:08.197]  Well, as for the historical record of the Soviets, or the Bolshevik Revolution rather, I mean, they, the British were directly opposed to them and they funded the white movements, they funded the white army, and... They always fund both sides.
[00:48:09.218 --> 00:48:13.279]  Are you saying the West did not fund Lenin's train of gold?
[00:48:14.238 --> 00:48:15.439]  No, I'm not aware of that.
[00:48:15.479 --> 00:48:17.701]  And you brought that up last time we talked, and I looked into it.
[00:48:17.721 --> 00:48:17.941]  Well, no, no.
[00:48:18.001 --> 00:48:21.664]  You raised Wall Street and the rise of Hitler and Anthony Sutton, the U.S.
[00:48:21.764 --> 00:48:22.745]  Senate historian.
[00:48:22.785 --> 00:48:23.366]  That's all true.
[00:48:23.386 --> 00:48:24.707]  And I've got clips of that.
[00:48:24.747 --> 00:48:25.407]  That's all true.
[00:48:25.627 --> 00:48:25.828]  Yeah.
[00:48:26.248 --> 00:48:29.871]  It's true that Brown Brother Harriman, the Bushes, Hitler, Operation Paperclip,
[00:48:30.734 --> 00:48:35.055]  British intelligence setting up Hitler to then double-cross him at a secret peace treaty.
[00:48:35.335 --> 00:48:35.835]  Yeah.
[00:48:35.895 --> 00:48:37.335]  Rudolph Hess trying to fly it.
[00:48:37.395 --> 00:48:40.296]  I mean, I've read literally, I used to be addicted to it.
[00:48:40.356 --> 00:48:41.056]  I barely sleep.
[00:48:41.296 --> 00:48:43.077]  I've read, it sounds ridiculous.
[00:48:43.417 --> 00:48:45.757]  I've probably read 500 history books from a different angle.
[00:48:45.777 --> 00:48:47.078]  So you get a real knowledge reading them all.
[00:48:47.118 --> 00:48:47.318]  Yeah.
[00:48:47.538 --> 00:48:50.678]  And then reading the writings of Hitler and all the rest of it, talking to family that was there.
[00:48:50.978 --> 00:48:53.599]  So I agree with you, Hitler was really bad, but it was also a setup.
[00:48:54.755 --> 00:49:12.505]  And Neville Chamberlain and all the rest of it was designed to appease, to suck him in, and Edward VIII was really a Nazi, he was the head of the EU, and the King of England, and he had to advocate, I'm an American woman, I know all those facts, but what I'm saying to you, and just run over me if you want, is that why is corporate media promoting what you call communism?
[00:49:12.825 --> 00:49:16.767]  Why did the CFR back communist China until ten years ago when they broke with them?
[00:49:16.847 --> 00:49:20.249]  I see Xi Jinping breaking with them and saying a three-child policy,
[00:49:21.049 --> 00:49:21.530]  It's good.
[00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:25.832]  That's why George Soros went from saying he's the best guy in the world ten years ago to he's Hitler.
[00:49:26.393 --> 00:49:30.395]  So I get what you're saying, that the end all be all of evil is not as easy a thing.
[00:49:30.855 --> 00:49:32.156]  Or certainly not Vladimir Putin.
[00:49:32.176 --> 00:49:33.597]  I don't see Russia doing anything John is doing.
[00:49:33.997 --> 00:49:36.739]  So I think out of all the countries in the world, Russia is being the most moral right now.
[00:49:36.779 --> 00:49:37.620]  I just say it as a fact.
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:45.704]  But that's the history that's there, that the big universities promoting communism, all of this.
[00:49:46.424 --> 00:49:48.745]  Well, I think we need to distinguish two things.
[00:49:49.025 --> 00:49:51.646]  You brought up orthodox communism.
[00:49:51.686 --> 00:49:52.327]  What is that?
[00:49:52.867 --> 00:49:54.428]  It's not blue-haired liberals.
[00:49:54.508 --> 00:49:55.648]  It's not AOC.
[00:49:55.728 --> 00:49:57.069]  It's not Bernie Sanders.
[00:49:57.149 --> 00:49:59.310]  It's not this racial divide.
[00:49:59.370 --> 00:50:00.030]  It's not any of that.
[00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:02.912]  It's not, you know, we're just going to tax billionaires more.
[00:50:02.952 --> 00:50:03.792]  It's not any of that.
[00:50:03.972 --> 00:50:07.794]  It's looking at what are the fundamental problems of our country.
[00:50:08.614 --> 00:50:12.918]  We prioritize, in our country right now, it's anti-growth politics.
[00:50:12.978 --> 00:50:16.900]  So you see it as state-directed, pro-populist views?
[00:50:17.981 --> 00:50:19.843]  No, I see it as communism.
[00:50:19.903 --> 00:50:21.264]  I see it as nothing but that.
[00:50:21.304 --> 00:50:23.906]  I mean, you look at... There's nothing more centralized.
[00:50:23.926 --> 00:50:24.106]  Go ahead.
[00:50:24.186 --> 00:50:25.147]  I'm going to shut up.
[00:50:25.167 --> 00:50:25.767]  I'm going to shut up.
[00:50:25.787 --> 00:50:26.488]  Go ahead.
[00:50:26.668 --> 00:50:27.648]  You say centralized.
[00:50:27.728 --> 00:50:30.490]  I think our country, I think our economy is centralized right now.
[00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:32.092]  I think it's a planned centralized economy.
[00:50:32.112 --> 00:50:33.453]  It's totally crony-capitalist-fascist.
[00:50:34.184 --> 00:50:43.108]  I think the difference is, in a communist country, you plan the economy for the people and for the country to improve.
[00:50:43.308 --> 00:50:47.130]  In a country like we have today, I don't think you can really call it capitalism.
[00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:53.592]  Well, Stalin was bad in my view and killed a lot of people, but Russia did leap forward from 95% being agrarian farmers to a
[00:50:55.533 --> 00:50:57.274]  High-tech titan in 50 years.
[00:50:57.874 --> 00:50:58.094]  Yeah.
[00:50:58.434 --> 00:51:11.338]  It went from, like, you know, horse-drawn plows before Stalin to after Stalin having one of the most fierce, you know, militaries, nuclear bombs in a developed society that's the foundation of Russia today.
[00:51:11.958 --> 00:51:13.459]  But that's the power of humanity.
[00:51:14.019 --> 00:51:15.780]  I don't want to harness humanity like a horse.
[00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:19.461]  I want it to be free and then on its own free will it can pull ten times the weight.
[00:51:20.967 --> 00:51:24.428]  Well, there's always going to be people polling and maneuvering... I'm going to shut up!
[00:51:24.488 --> 00:51:25.088]  I keep saying I am!
[00:51:25.108 --> 00:51:26.869]  Okay, I'm going to shut up for five minutes.
[00:51:26.889 --> 00:51:27.829]  Go ahead and tell us about communism.
[00:51:29.209 --> 00:51:48.315]  What I was saying was, in America, in the West, you have an economy that's planned and oriented for the big banksters, for Wall Street, for the energy conglomerates, for Big Pharma, to saddle their horse, to pocket more cash, and ultimately to achieve more control over the masses, to ultimately depopulate the countries.
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:52:00.224]  In a country like China or the Soviet Union, I mean, their goals are growth, growth, growth, and prioritizing the people at the fundamental point of their economy.
[00:52:00.264 --> 00:52:02.445]  It's not about prioritizing big banks.
[00:52:02.525 --> 00:52:04.926]  It's not about prioritizing anything other than the people.
[00:52:05.546 --> 00:52:13.509]  It's about making sure that people live better lives, more prosperous lives, have more free time, can have easier access to goods.
[00:52:14.489 --> 00:52:16.790]  I mean, I was just having a conversation with someone today.
[00:52:16.810 --> 00:52:18.251]  We were talking about
[00:52:19.091 --> 00:52:25.315]  The delivery systems in the United States versus the delivery systems in China, because I just got back from China a few months ago.
[00:52:25.716 --> 00:52:37.524]  In China, if you want any basic good, if you want a pen, if you want a hairdryer, whatever it may be, you order it on their equivalent of Amazon, and it arrives from a guy on a moped within 10 minutes.
[00:52:37.624 --> 00:52:40.626]  In the United States, you have to wait three days to get something like that.
[00:52:41.346 --> 00:52:45.908]  So, I think China is just showing that whatever they're doing is working.
[00:52:46.849 --> 00:52:51.171]  You can have critiques of Chinese culture, of their history, whatever.
[00:52:51.271 --> 00:52:59.175]  But since World War II, we've seen a handful of ideologies play out, a handful of different forms of governments that have played out.
[00:52:59.516 --> 00:53:03.578]  And I think that ultimately, communism has proven to be the most successful.
[00:53:04.598 --> 00:53:07.580]  You know, meritocracy has proven to be the most successful.
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:13.304]  What we have in the United States is an abysmal failure, and it's about to implode right before our eyes.
[00:53:14.084 --> 00:53:27.632]  Well, I don't debate with you that the current kleptocracy we have is corrupt, but I would not call it capitalism, but a form of corporate fascism using communism at the lower ranks to control people.
[00:53:27.873 --> 00:53:32.916]  And then to say communism delivers, it caused the Russian population to basically shrink
[00:53:33.596 --> 00:53:34.997]  They had long food lines.
[00:53:35.557 --> 00:53:37.139]  Classical communism does not work.
[00:53:37.499 --> 00:53:44.343]  Barack Obama, before he left office, gave speeches all over the world where he said, well, we want to work with communist countries, with capitalist countries, and then we get the goods from them.
[00:53:44.864 --> 00:53:48.466]  And that just becomes a more form of planned economy centralization.
[00:53:48.486 --> 00:53:49.967]  So I think communism is fascist.
[00:53:50.467 --> 00:53:52.008]  All those are just interchangeable terms.
[00:53:52.048 --> 00:53:53.469]  We have command and control economies.
[00:53:53.930 --> 00:54:03.116]  And so just because we look at our corrupt system does not mean that we then endorse these other systems of Xi Jinping and Joseph Stalin.
[00:54:04.337 --> 00:54:17.091]  Based on China's economic structure, it's just ultimately increase, you know, the levers of production and make sure that, you know, manufacturing is at its peak and that these systems benefit the people as a whole.
[00:54:17.151 --> 00:54:20.956]  I mean they lifted 840 million people out of poverty in the last 40 years.
[00:54:22.177 --> 00:54:23.378]  And drones fly around.
[00:54:24.335 --> 00:54:25.456]  So tell me what to do.
[00:54:25.556 --> 00:54:28.379]  Taking a side, well, I mean, I've been to China, I haven't seen any of that.
[00:54:28.579 --> 00:54:30.381]  I think China's lied about quite a bit.
[00:54:30.601 --> 00:54:34.726]  I didn't see any social credit scores, I didn't see any drones, I didn't see anything like that.
[00:54:34.826 --> 00:54:37.388]  I mean, China has a social credit score.
[00:54:37.989 --> 00:54:38.549]  I didn't see it.
[00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.831]  I didn't see it.
[00:54:39.851 --> 00:54:40.692]  That's because you're a foreigner.
[00:54:42.461 --> 00:54:49.527]  I think Vice News did the piece on the social credit score and I just don't really believe anything Vice News has to say.
[00:54:49.568 --> 00:54:53.131]  But what do you think besides, put aside the surveillance.
[00:54:53.211 --> 00:54:58.115]  China was following the globalist model of one child policy until 10 years ago.
[00:54:59.235 --> 00:55:03.358]  I'm glad Xi Jinping got off that, but no, I mean, they were following the globalist cheat.
[00:55:04.199 --> 00:55:06.841]  And that's another... You're going to ask me a question, but later we'll get back to it.
[00:55:07.261 --> 00:55:10.404]  What do you make of the clear break with the communist Chinese and the globalist?
[00:55:10.864 --> 00:55:17.169]  Well, I think communists as a whole, I mean, the whole idea of communism is to have ruthless self-critique.
[00:55:17.209 --> 00:55:19.971]  You hear Stalin talk about that, you heard Mao talk about that.
[00:55:20.472 --> 00:55:21.913]  And the Chinese are very open about it.
[00:55:21.933 --> 00:55:22.814]  If you go to China,
[00:55:23.794 --> 00:55:32.200]  Just average people, the government, the leaders, they're all very open about the problems that are facing their country and what they need to do to solve these problems.
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:38.964]  So when I went there, you know, I didn't really know what was kosher to talk about with people.
[00:55:39.584 --> 00:55:41.886]  And the people were just talking about the problems with me.
[00:55:41.926 --> 00:55:47.789]  They said, oh, you know, we have, you know, we've got this problem that we're trying to deal with with population and so forth.
[00:55:49.110 --> 00:55:51.933]  You know, applying these solutions to try and fix these issues.
[00:55:51.993 --> 00:55:57.077]  In the United States, the government, the people, everyone just acts like we don't have problems.
[00:55:57.097 --> 00:55:58.859]  Yeah, they tell us there's no inflation.
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:01.541]  Or no inflation until six months ago.
[00:56:01.582 --> 00:56:02.883]  Now it's really bad, but they're going to lose.
[00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:03.610]  Yeah.
[00:56:04.251 --> 00:56:15.979]  So, what I was going to ask you was, putting aside, you know, potential critiques you might have about China's surveillance or, you know, biometric stuff that they're doing, what do you dislike about China's economy?
[00:56:16.019 --> 00:56:22.744]  Because they've, GDP purchasing power parity, they've far surpassed the United States, they've lifted tens of millions out of poverty.
[00:56:23.545 --> 00:56:27.868]  What are your problems, I guess, with China's economic structure?
[00:56:28.068 --> 00:56:32.432]  Well, that's because they were given one-sided trade deals with the middlemen Trump talked about.
[00:56:33.152 --> 00:56:41.536]  Since the 1970s, to transfer all the production capacity, they don't have the carbon taxes, they don't have their coal power plants being shut down, so they have cheaper energy.
[00:56:42.257 --> 00:56:54.583]  The globalists have built in economic tariffs against the West because they had deals with China to make more, as Trump, when he saw the deals, were like, wait, the Chinese make like 20%, the middlemen make like 60%, and then we make
[00:56:58.757 --> 00:56:59.297]  Twenty percent.
[00:56:59.898 --> 00:57:02.880]  So he was like, you won't believe what the black rock, which is true.
[00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:05.121]  And you can see that as a command and control of Trump.
[00:57:05.161 --> 00:57:09.784]  No, it's not command and control to say, how did middlemen set up deals where only Chinese companies deal with this?
[00:57:10.144 --> 00:57:10.284]  Yeah.
[00:57:10.364 --> 00:57:11.645]  And Xi Jinping has pulled that back.
[00:57:11.665 --> 00:57:12.726]  That's what the middlemen are pissed.
[00:57:13.166 --> 00:57:14.167]  Now I'm broken with Xi Jinping.
[00:57:14.187 --> 00:57:15.607]  So I see that as a good break.
[00:57:16.168 --> 00:57:18.049]  It's just that that that's what China did.
[00:57:18.109 --> 00:57:19.290]  And they have smart people are working.
[00:57:19.310 --> 00:57:20.651]  I'm not taking it away from them.
[00:57:21.311 --> 00:57:22.051]  Over a billion of them.
[00:57:22.071 --> 00:57:22.692]  I mean, that was, you know.
[00:57:23.686 --> 00:57:32.268]  Yeah, you know, I think one interesting thing about China is that when Trump was... Hold on, Jackson Hinkle, stay there.
[00:57:32.668 --> 00:57:35.009]  People can follow you on X at Jackson Hinkle.
[00:57:35.669 --> 00:57:37.109]  And that's the place to follow you?
[00:57:37.229 --> 00:57:38.189]  Yes, only place.
[00:57:38.570 --> 00:57:41.170]  And I'm Alex Jones at InfoWars.com, banned on video.
[00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:42.911]  And real Alex Jones, please follow us there.
[00:57:43.211 --> 00:57:44.211]  Hour number two, straight ahead.
[00:57:50.290 --> 00:57:53.413]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:57:53.433 --> 00:57:54.974]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:57:55.735 --> 00:57:58.777]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:57:59.658 --> 00:58:07.765]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:58:08.605 --> 00:58:16.392]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:58:17.398 --> 00:58:20.260]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:26.044]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:58:26.845 --> 00:58:29.827]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[00:58:29.867 --> 00:58:38.113]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:58:38.813 --> 00:58:42.455]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsaw.com.
[00:58:43.115 --> 00:58:47.717]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsaw.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:58:48.057 --> 00:58:48.897]  Please take action now.
[00:58:49.398 --> 00:58:51.959]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalists.
[00:58:52.319 --> 00:58:54.660]  And people can't identify who's a patron and who isn't.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.921]  We want to identify as pro-human.
[00:58:57.421 --> 00:58:58.141]  Anti-Globalist.
[00:58:58.201 --> 00:59:01.102]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.
[00:59:01.342 --> 00:59:11.924]  That's why I designed this amazing 1776 red, white, and blue Gadsden flag shirt so you can support the InfoWar and meet like-minded people everywhere when you wear it.
[00:59:12.044 --> 00:59:17.665]  When you wear these shirts it creates an amazing amount of energy and it's quite the adventure.
[00:59:17.965 --> 00:59:23.426]  So get your 1776 shirt right now at infowarestore.com and get your team
[00:59:23.706 --> 00:59:24.906]  We're good to go.
[00:59:51.010 --> 00:59:56.933]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:06.457 --> 01:00:15.461]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the end for war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you've got one!
[01:00:17.679 --> 01:00:22.543]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.689 --> 01:00:38.693]  The 248-page patent for the Moderna technology that was administered to people in the COVID shots was filed in 2020.
[01:00:38.753 --> 01:00:45.097]  The patent lists several embodiments, or variations, of this technology.
[01:00:45.477 --> 01:00:54.081]  And while we don't know who got what embodiment, we know that several different batch numbers were deployed, and some were far more deadlier than others.
[01:00:55.342 --> 01:01:00.867]  According to the Moderna patent, this technology contains self-assembled nanoparticles.
[01:01:01.247 --> 01:01:08.433]  And in certain variations, these nanoparticles can be used for the controlled release of compounds once they are in the human body.
[01:01:09.233 --> 01:01:17.820]  These lipid nanoparticles are encapsulated into a polymer hydrogel, a controlled release coating that includes polyvinyls.
[01:01:18.481 --> 01:01:22.264]  This has been verified by Anna Mielchia and Clifford Carnicom's research.
[01:01:23.467 --> 01:01:36.491]  In a 2013 TEDMED talk, Dr. Ito Bachelet says that these nanorobots have already been successfully developed in Israel, and that they can be injected into the human body with a basic syringe.
[01:01:37.031 --> 01:01:48.474]  He shows an image of what they look like, and they appear to be the same structures that the fifth column found in their research, and claimed was powered by 5G, which was confirmed by Dr. Bachelet.
[01:01:48.934 --> 01:01:51.675]  My team developed nanorobots that carry antennas.
[01:01:52.135 --> 01:01:54.516]  These antennas are made from metal nanoparticles.
[01:01:55.036 --> 01:02:00.379]  Now, the antenna enables the nanobots to respond to externally applied electromagnetic fields.
[01:02:00.819 --> 01:02:06.221]  So these versions of nanobots can actually be activated with the press of a button on a joystick.
[01:02:06.781 --> 01:02:10.322]  In the following video, it is being discussed by developers in 2015.
[01:02:25.506 --> 01:02:26.046]  I think so.
[01:02:41.477 --> 01:02:52.741]  So the two halves of this open-ended barrel or clamshell are linked together by flexible DNA hinges and the entire structure is held shut by latches or locks that are actually DNA double helices.
[01:02:52.881 --> 01:03:02.704]  The way it works is that in the absence of the key, which is a molecular protein, the duplexes are held sufficiently strong to maintain the entire structure closed.
[01:03:03.364 --> 01:03:08.026]  But when the key is present, that piece of DNA that we designed to recognize, that key,
[01:03:09.186 --> 01:03:12.388]  Switches to bind to the key and the duplex zips open.
[01:03:13.349 --> 01:03:25.836]  The work of Todd Callender's team at VaxChoice.com have concluded that these shots contain a variety of synthetic pathogens that can be released with external 5G frequencies.
[01:03:26.317 --> 01:03:36.483]  The Moderna patent describes these nanoparticle mimics, which mimic the delivery of a variety of pathogens and lists over a hundred of them within the patent.
[01:03:38.072 --> 01:03:43.994]  And according to the work at Vax Choice, these synthetic pathogens each have an IP address.
[01:03:44.914 --> 01:03:47.195]  They are catalogued by the Department of Energy.
[01:03:48.015 --> 01:03:58.139]  And they use Cesium-137, which we have been contaminated with from the environment, as a building block for their construction within our bodies using external frequency.
[01:03:59.349 --> 01:04:16.291]  And their research shows that the Microsoft patent filed in 2020 060606 cryptocurrency system using body activity data is now in effect and that this technology is turning the human body into an antenna which can output energy.
[01:04:17.072 --> 01:04:24.376]  Meaning that humans are being turned into batteries to fuel the digital AI prison that is being built around us.
[01:04:25.116 --> 01:04:29.778]  And if you choose not to comply, the technology includes a built-in kill switch.
[01:04:30.919 --> 01:04:35.381]  Thanks to many independent researchers and scientists, we are figuring out their agenda.
[01:04:35.741 --> 01:04:41.024]  But they continue to walk freely among us, unrestrained by any justice whatsoever.
[01:04:42.165 --> 01:04:44.666]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:04:46.761 --> 01:04:48.282]  Jackson Hinkle is our guest.
[01:04:48.302 --> 01:04:49.543]  We're gonna take a one-minute break.
[01:04:49.563 --> 01:04:51.584]  Join a bunch of stations that don't carry the first five minutes.

[01:06:14.187 --> 01:06:16.530]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:06:17.391 --> 01:06:21.195]  Alright, very interesting iconoclasts.
[01:06:27.051 --> 01:06:30.172]  Jackson Hinkle, very successful talk show host here with us.
[01:06:30.192 --> 01:06:31.832]  You got caught up in the break talking about Trump.
[01:06:32.532 --> 01:06:34.493]  And I know the news, I cover it from China.
[01:06:35.033 --> 01:06:36.113]  They actually like Trump.
[01:06:36.153 --> 01:06:39.094]  People who don't know, explain that and then let's get your view on the election.
[01:06:39.754 --> 01:06:43.315]  All the things that are happening with 95 plus billion to Ukraine.
[01:06:44.155 --> 01:06:47.476]  Russia's serious concerns and threats dealing with that.
[01:06:48.316 --> 01:06:50.117]  You've been to Russia recently, you've been to China recently.
[01:06:50.777 --> 01:06:51.337]  I'll get into that.
[01:06:52.078 --> 01:07:19.998]  Yeah, as for the point we were discussing when we cut for break, what I was bringing up was, it was so interesting, when I went to China, people referred to Trump as Comrade Trump, because just in the same way as Russia, their national companies, their Russian-based entities, they've all benefited from the sanction war against Russia, post-Ukraine war, Chinese companies actually benefited from Trump's trade war, because
[01:07:20.578 --> 01:07:34.912]  It cut out a lot of the middlemen that were associated with Chinese companies, and then they had to, in a massive scale, invest heavily in their own Chinese production, making a lot of parts and pieces for products that they didn't do so previously.
[01:07:34.932 --> 01:07:35.852]  And that's what Trump said.
[01:07:36.253 --> 01:07:37.754]  He said, America's China making money.
[01:07:37.974 --> 01:07:39.116]  We're cutting the middlemen out.
[01:07:39.736 --> 01:07:41.077]  To help the people on both sides.
[01:07:41.617 --> 01:07:42.337]  Very sophisticated.
[01:07:42.777 --> 01:07:43.518]  Yes, yes.
[01:07:43.558 --> 01:07:44.838]  So they called him Comrade Trump.
[01:07:44.858 --> 01:07:47.499]  The hardline nationalists in China love Trump.
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:52.181]  That was one thing I was really surprised by, but... I remember seeing even news articles in China where they liked him.
[01:07:52.461 --> 01:07:52.902]  Why was that?
[01:07:52.922 --> 01:07:53.842]  Because he just straight shot them?
[01:07:54.362 --> 01:07:55.183]  Yes, yes.
[01:07:55.263 --> 01:08:01.705]  You know, the Chinese, they... No one in China buys all this, you know, the racial politics, the woke politics.
[01:08:01.745 --> 01:08:08.108]  When people say they ban and censor stuff in China, they're protecting the youth from the LGBTQ propaganda.
[01:08:08.328 --> 01:08:09.769]  Well, that's the final equation.
[01:08:09.849 --> 01:08:12.390]  China and Russia ban the LGBT.
[01:08:12.970 --> 01:08:13.970]  It's force-fed here.
[01:08:14.011 --> 01:08:14.631]  What does that tell you?
[01:08:15.891 --> 01:08:18.993]  I think it tells you that our leaders want to destroy our country.
[01:08:20.273 --> 01:08:22.354]  And why, if it's their source of power, do they want that?
[01:08:22.374 --> 01:08:23.375]  Because they clearly want that.
[01:08:23.415 --> 01:08:24.015]  Why are they doing it?
[01:08:25.567 --> 01:08:38.394]  Ultimately, when you have weak people that are not just mentally weak, but also strategically weak, when they have things that they hide, like our leaders in government who live degenerate lifestyles, I mean, it's very easy to control them.
[01:08:38.835 --> 01:08:46.199]  And that's exactly what we saw this week with the new surveillance bills they're passing and this $90 billion to Ukraine and Israel you're talking about.
[01:08:46.239 --> 01:08:53.543]  I mean, if you had people that actually represented the interests of the public in Washington, D.C., who are uncorruptible, you wouldn't have this happen.
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:09:02.484]  I could tell the establishment, and I did, if you try to take Trump off the ballot and dive him, it's going to make him more popular.
[01:09:03.084 --> 01:09:06.786]  They don't seem to, they think one-dimensional, like we'll just get him, we'll just get him.
[01:09:07.126 --> 01:09:14.090]  Same thing with us, they made us way bigger attacking us, and they didn't do it to help us, they legitimately hate me, but they just can't think multi-move.
[01:09:14.791 --> 01:09:20.074]  They're not chess players, but they've been given the power of the central bank, so they are in charge, and they do have nuclear weapons.
[01:09:21.094 --> 01:09:34.770]  Well, the young individual that filmed our conversation yesterday, the interview I did with you, he's from California, great filmer, and he was talking with me today and he said, you know, everything they do to Trump makes me like him more.
[01:09:34.791 --> 01:09:41.779]  The lawsuits, putting him in prison, and that flows down to even us as political commentators or journalists.
[01:09:42.099 --> 01:10:00.983]  You look at the most famous journalists in America today, or people who have online personas, political personas, Candace Owens, Joe Rogan, Jimmy Dore, Tucker Carlson, yourself, and I don't want to put myself on that tier, but I definitely am viral on Twitter, on X, and we are all independent.
[01:10:01.103 --> 01:10:02.124]  And they have attacked us.
[01:10:02.144 --> 01:10:02.924]  They have banned us.
[01:10:03.664 --> 01:10:04.265]  I don't know.
[01:10:20.236 --> 01:10:30.745]  Yes, they blew up, um, you know, they killed Daria Dugina, and I spent a good chunk of time with her father last time I was in Russia, and he's, uh, you know, he's someone that respects a lot of the work you do, as well.
[01:10:30.765 --> 01:10:31.566]  He's been on before.
[01:10:31.586 --> 01:10:33.808]  I hadn't really, I knew he was, but I hadn't researched him.
[01:10:33.828 --> 01:10:34.509]  He needs to come back on.
[01:10:34.709 --> 01:10:34.849]  Yeah.
[01:10:35.495 --> 01:10:38.736]  You should come back, let's do like a three-hour commercial-free show with him.
[01:10:38.756 --> 01:10:42.098]  I think that'd be great, and I definitely think he'd be very interested to do that.
[01:10:42.138 --> 01:10:43.239]  That'd be an excellent conversation.
[01:10:43.259 --> 01:10:49.882]  Well, he goes beyond capitalism, communism, right to cultures, and what cultures ethos is, their archetype, and it's totally true.
[01:10:50.062 --> 01:10:50.262]  Yeah.
[01:10:50.682 --> 01:10:55.484]  And Russia's a land power, and Putin says, we're the biggest country in the world, we've got more assets than Africa.
[01:10:57.905 --> 01:10:59.626]  We don't need to take you over.
[01:10:59.686 --> 01:11:01.708]  We sold you to Alaska for 500 million bucks.
[01:11:02.228 --> 01:11:03.729]  We don't want to expand.
[01:11:03.849 --> 01:11:04.970]  China needs land.
[01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:06.651]  China needs to expand.
[01:11:06.731 --> 01:11:07.451]  Russia doesn't.
[01:11:08.432 --> 01:11:23.382]  One of the questions I asked Alexander Dugin when I sat down with him, and I'm going to be releasing the video soon, but I said, and I want to hear your thoughts on this, I said, how can America develop its own American logos in a non-antagonistic way as the multipolar world?
[01:11:23.522 --> 01:11:24.303]  As non-Atlantean.
[01:11:24.543 --> 01:11:24.683]  Yeah.
[01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:26.990]  So go ahead, what did he say?
[01:11:27.911 --> 01:11:28.711]  I'm curious to hear you.
[01:11:28.792 --> 01:11:31.794]  He said, he said basically that America already has it.
[01:11:32.014 --> 01:11:33.575]  It's the people, it's MAGA.
[01:11:33.615 --> 01:11:35.156]  That's why he loves MAGA so much.
[01:11:35.597 --> 01:11:44.864]  And he said that the problem is that you have, you know, the big cities, you have the New York's, the Los Angeles's, San Francisco's, and they are defrauding the American public.
[01:11:44.884 --> 01:11:49.628]  They're waving the American flag as they, you know, take your taxes to go bomb other countries.
[01:11:49.848 --> 01:11:50.408]  It's exactly.
[01:11:51.409 --> 01:11:59.315]  He said what Thomas Jefferson said, he said farmers ought to run stuff because they actually live in the real world.
[01:12:00.236 --> 01:12:01.897]  And that's what Dugan is basically saying.
[01:12:03.038 --> 01:12:06.841]  Because nothing against city dwellers folks, I'm a city boy too but I've worked on ranches and stuff.
[01:12:07.401 --> 01:12:15.307]  These average liberals have grown up in the high rise, they don't know how to do anything, even wipe their ass, and they're trying to make us all live like them.
[01:12:15.568 --> 01:12:16.428]  They don't know anything.
[01:12:17.449 --> 01:12:18.409]  Yeah, no, I agree.
[01:12:18.429 --> 01:12:19.189]  I agree 100%.
[01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:23.271]  It's why when you look at MAGA, it's just like normal people.
[01:12:23.471 --> 01:12:27.452]  That's why it's so welcoming when you go to any Trump event, it's normal people.
[01:12:27.912 --> 01:12:32.113]  And you said earlier, you said, you know, why are you such a big fan of Trump as a Stalinist?
[01:12:32.713 --> 01:12:36.234]  And the truth of the matter is, the way I describe it, I know I like a lot of things about Trump.
[01:12:36.574 --> 01:12:36.834]  I do.
[01:12:37.394 --> 01:12:38.775]  And I think he did a lot of good things.
[01:12:38.995 --> 01:12:44.016]  I think at the start of his administration, and you probably agree, there was a lot of bad people surrounding him that were...
[01:12:44.616 --> 01:12:45.237]  He's so crazy.
[01:13:07.486 --> 01:13:13.232]  I don't blame you for your views and what you've fallen in love with because you're honest about it.
[01:13:13.953 --> 01:13:19.959]  So instead of worrying about Stalinism that doesn't even exist now, the transhumanists are the dominant global cancer.
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:21.481]  And they're Trotskyists.
[01:13:22.462 --> 01:13:24.524]  Explain the paradigm because people don't know this.
[01:13:25.615 --> 01:13:26.656]  This is not even my opinion.
[01:13:27.096 --> 01:13:30.958]  It's mainline news that Trotsky gets run out once Stalin gets in.
[01:13:31.359 --> 01:13:33.060]  He was kind of the brains behind a lot of things.
[01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:34.480]  He gets run out.
[01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:35.501]  He goes to Mexico.
[01:13:35.641 --> 01:13:40.464]  He gets killed by a Stalin assassin with an ice axe.
[01:13:41.084 --> 01:13:41.505]  Dies.
[01:13:42.305 --> 01:13:52.889]  But they admit that National Review and the Republicans and the neocons are all agents of Trotsky, and that's why they're so anti-Russia.
[01:13:53.589 --> 01:13:56.830]  And so they flip the conservative, but they're actually creating a total tyranny.
[01:13:57.271 --> 01:13:58.451]  So these labels mean nothing.
[01:13:58.491 --> 01:14:03.513]  Explain the paradigm or the dichotomy between Stalin and Trotsky and why that's so important.
[01:14:04.333 --> 01:14:13.279]  Well, Trotsky is the embodiment of anti-human scum that now finds itself, you know, in the new ideological inheritors.
[01:14:13.579 --> 01:14:16.421]  People like Mike Pompeo, for example.
[01:14:17.562 --> 01:14:21.485]  You know, people... I personally think Ron DeSantis, but you know, I don't know.
[01:14:21.945 --> 01:14:30.571]  I think that there's a lot of really bad people that try to safeguard themselves by saying, oh, you know, we are anti-woke.
[01:14:31.071 --> 01:14:37.337]  And by the way, their ideology is Machiavellian, sociopathic, in their own writings, from the Chicago Business School.
[01:14:37.417 --> 01:14:39.478]  I mean, they say we want total power.
[01:14:39.819 --> 01:14:42.041]  They fully believe in the Malthusian worldview.
[01:14:42.261 --> 01:14:44.122]  A hundred percent.
[01:14:44.182 --> 01:14:45.664]  They want to depopulate the Earth.
[01:14:45.764 --> 01:14:49.487]  They want 500 million people or less left on the whole planet.
[01:14:49.507 --> 01:14:50.548]  I mean, this is their goal.
[01:14:50.768 --> 01:14:52.550]  So talk about Trotsky, because he was fascinating.
[01:14:53.291 --> 01:14:57.776]  Well, Trotsky was someone who defrauded Stalin.
[01:14:57.836 --> 01:15:08.066]  I mean, if you look at a lot of the early problems in the Soviet Union, such as the mass imprisonment of Orthodox Christians... Targeting Christians was Trotsky.
[01:15:08.186 --> 01:15:09.508]  Yeah, that was all Trotsky.
[01:15:09.548 --> 01:15:12.731]  And notice when it ended, it was when they kicked Trotsky out.
[01:15:12.751 --> 01:15:15.053]  And that's why Russians love Stalin, is because he stopped the persecution.
[01:15:15.093 --> 01:15:15.273]  Yes.
[01:15:16.038 --> 01:15:22.202]  Yes, and Stalin when he was younger he almost became a minister in the Orthodox Church.
[01:15:22.222 --> 01:15:26.345]  He was studying to become that and then later in life he started to go to the Orthodox Church again.
[01:15:27.346 --> 01:15:35.351]  But he reopened the churches during World War II and when they kicked out Trotsky everything got better.
[01:15:35.371 --> 01:15:41.736]  So you're saying that's why the American media attacked Stalin was because, in my view, as bad as he was, he was not the Trotskyites.
[01:15:42.168 --> 01:15:43.810]  Yeah, that's why they love Trotsky.
[01:15:43.950 --> 01:15:48.074]  Because the enemy of your enemy is your friend, according to mass media in the United States.
[01:15:48.975 --> 01:15:51.318]  And that's true for even historical figures like him.
[01:15:56.065 --> 01:16:02.869]  It should be no surprise that these people who hate Russia, who want to tear Russia apart, they're the same exact people who love Trotsky.
[01:16:02.989 --> 01:16:04.630]  They're the same exact families.
[01:16:04.650 --> 01:16:06.871]  Well, Trotsky was the administrator that carried it out.
[01:16:07.471 --> 01:16:10.133]  Klaus Schwab, for example, he loves Trotsky.
[01:16:10.433 --> 01:16:12.274]  You look at the families.
[01:16:12.354 --> 01:16:13.414]  Klaus Schwab loves Lenin.
[01:16:13.434 --> 01:16:14.675]  He has a bus in his office.
[01:16:15.535 --> 01:16:19.938]  Well, I don't know if he read the same things that I read, if he loves Lenin.
[01:16:20.973 --> 01:16:21.754]  I don't know how you could.
[01:16:22.174 --> 01:16:29.702]  I think that you look at Klaus Schwab, I mean he's the antithesis of everything that Lenin and Stalin and Mao stood for.
[01:16:31.144 --> 01:16:32.866]  He stands for the globalist deep state.
[01:16:32.906 --> 01:16:34.908]  He stands in direct alignment with Trotsky.
[01:16:36.209 --> 01:16:38.732]  I think what's interesting is
[01:16:39.793 --> 01:16:53.522]  If you look at all these people, and we mentioned this in the first segment, you look at the families that funded the rise of Hitler, like the Dulles brothers, the Bush family, Central Bank of London, all these sorts of things.
[01:16:54.123 --> 01:16:58.105]  They all now are the ones with the reins in the United States.
[01:16:58.586 --> 01:17:07.692]  And I think the only way that we can save our country is to completely break the shackles of foreign control, foreign influence, free America, zero foreign aid.
[01:17:08.052 --> 01:17:09.153]  And we talked about this yesterday.
[01:17:09.773 --> 01:17:15.435]  I don't want to spill too much about it, but I think one of the things that needs to be done is to liberate Canada.
[01:17:15.735 --> 01:17:16.215]  What do you think?
[01:17:17.015 --> 01:17:18.615]  Well, we talked about that, and Tucker's right.
[01:17:18.655 --> 01:17:20.236]  I mean, Canada's now a WF.
[01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:22.156]  The current enemy is the transhumanists.
[01:17:22.176 --> 01:17:23.517]  They're the ones that are the global force.
[01:17:23.877 --> 01:17:24.697]  They worked with China.
[01:17:24.737 --> 01:17:25.697]  China turned against them.
[01:17:26.157 --> 01:17:28.658]  So this is all breaking up.
[01:17:29.398 --> 01:17:31.679]  My larger issue is that
[01:17:34.122 --> 01:17:36.384]  I believe in real free market economics.
[01:17:36.424 --> 01:17:47.114]  The problem is we have a monopoly now with BlackRock with 88% control and it's not communist, you call it fascist, it's corporate social engineering.
[01:17:47.395 --> 01:17:49.717]  It doesn't even have a political name, it's just anti-human.
[01:17:52.605 --> 01:17:54.387]  And by its very design, it's anti-human.
[01:17:54.768 --> 01:17:56.730]  So I'm glad Xi Jinping has pulled out of it.
[01:17:57.210 --> 01:17:59.233]  I'm glad Putin is openly opposing it.
[01:17:59.413 --> 01:18:00.434]  I can say that's good.
[01:18:00.915 --> 01:18:03.638]  We kind of have an ancestral memory, you know, to fight all of that.
[01:18:04.078 --> 01:18:11.247]  But I still see China, with its great control of Hollywood, still working with the Trotskyites to fund all this anti-Americanism.
[01:18:12.256 --> 01:18:15.439]  I think a lot of that's overstated by the Defense Department.
[01:18:15.499 --> 01:18:19.002]  I think they want to make a boogeyman out of China when they could make peace with China.
[01:18:19.042 --> 01:18:28.391]  I think this stuff going on with the TikTok bill, I mean, I think there's very nefarious actors that are pushing that because they want to eventually take out Twitter or Axe.
[01:18:28.951 --> 01:18:33.835]  They want to take out Truth Social because we all know Truth Social is going to blow up when Trump wins the presidency.
[01:18:34.916 --> 01:18:37.437]  I think that there's a lot of things going on.
[01:18:37.477 --> 01:18:40.260]  They tell you, oh, China's bad, so we have to attack TikTok.
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:42.481]  And then the end goal has nothing to do with China.
[01:18:42.501 --> 01:18:47.105]  I mean, the CEO of, you know, ByteDance or whatever, he's from Singapore.
[01:18:47.665 --> 01:18:54.130]  And then they go on and use this legislation to attack the only free speech platform we have, the United States.
[01:18:54.710 --> 01:18:55.851]  And it's not even- Well, that's right.
[01:18:55.871 --> 01:18:58.113]  That legislation lets them take over any platform.
[01:18:58.473 --> 01:18:59.274]  Yeah.
[01:18:59.394 --> 01:19:04.657]  So shifting gears from your political ideology, but it's your world perspective.
[01:19:05.978 --> 01:19:10.501]  What is your gut level view on what's about to happen in the next hundred and ninety something days?
[01:19:13.203 --> 01:19:16.365]  We have real criminals in Washington right now.
[01:19:16.385 --> 01:19:25.491]  I mean, we've never seen I mean, of course, they've always done it, but such a direct open assault through lawfare against, you know, the former president.
[01:19:25.571 --> 01:19:27.753]  And now the guy is probably going to win.
[01:19:28.613 --> 01:19:30.195]  And they know they can't stop him.
[01:19:30.255 --> 01:19:32.096]  I mean, the numbers are very clear.
[01:19:32.777 --> 01:19:35.479]  And they also know it's a critical moment because Trump gets in.
[01:19:35.839 --> 01:19:37.060]  He's ending the Ukraine war.
[01:19:37.581 --> 01:19:38.281]  Trump gets in.
[01:19:38.942 --> 01:19:45.287]  He's probably going to bring peace to the Middle East, whether, you know, every side's going to have opinions about his plans.
[01:19:45.467 --> 01:19:47.108]  But he is probably going to do those things.
[01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:49.150]  Trump's a man that does not like war.
[01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:51.752]  Colonel Douglas MacGregor said it himself when I was talking to him.
[01:19:51.792 --> 01:19:52.833]  Trump does not like war.
[01:19:55.094 --> 01:20:00.878]  Don't be... Yeah, they called him anti-military because he says, I don't want troops to have their arms and legs blown off for no reason.
[01:20:02.079 --> 01:20:06.783]  So the point is, it's like we should not be surprised based on whatever happens.
[01:20:07.043 --> 01:20:11.146]  Because at the end of the day, we saw what they did to JFK.
[01:20:11.486 --> 01:20:13.128]  We saw what they did to RFK.
[01:20:13.168 --> 01:20:21.294]  We saw what they did to, you know, to all these figures that stood up for peace and justice and just like...
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:25.782]  Or wars and sovereignty all across the world.
[01:20:27.443 --> 01:20:28.204]  I would not be surprised.
[01:20:28.224 --> 01:20:29.345]  I don't want to even put it out in the air.
[01:20:29.385 --> 01:20:31.386]  That's why I'm... I think they're going to kill Trump.
[01:20:31.406 --> 01:20:32.447]  I don't want to put it out.
[01:20:32.467 --> 01:20:40.894]  So let's just put it out because the globalists are hard to beat because they don't have an ideology but deception.
[01:20:42.155 --> 01:20:43.576]  You can criticize a fascist.
[01:20:43.656 --> 01:20:44.717]  You can criticize a communist.
[01:20:44.737 --> 01:20:45.897]  You can criticize a capitalist.
[01:20:46.298 --> 01:20:47.659]  But they never say who they are.
[01:20:48.199 --> 01:20:49.400]  That's why they're so dangerous.
[01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:52.663]  And if you pull back from it and you look at it,
[01:20:53.766 --> 01:21:01.031]  These people are mentally ill, and they've inherited their power and they're going 100% against humanity itself.
[01:21:01.111 --> 01:21:02.592]  And so I went and saw the movie finally.
[01:21:08.232 --> 01:21:08.833]  I don't know.
[01:21:23.954 --> 01:21:28.618]  And they're going, and they kill the Secret Service, who are all white, and they kill the President, a black woman does.
[01:21:29.018 --> 01:21:29.899]  I love everybody, folks.
[01:21:29.919 --> 01:21:31.860]  The point is, they're making it racial.
[01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:34.942]  So people said, oh, the film's not political, you never know who the good and bad.
[01:21:35.002 --> 01:21:37.004]  No, it's 100% clear.
[01:21:37.304 --> 01:21:51.415]  So Hollywood is saying, America is about to fall, and it's going to be a race war that brings it in, and they're openly saying in the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the Washington Post, if Trump gets re-elected while he's President-elect, we're going to trigger a race war.
[01:21:52.662 --> 01:22:00.564]  And they, overhead shot right here, and they've got bills introduced to strip him from domestic military power.
[01:22:01.004 --> 01:22:05.005]  The Insurrection Act that George Herbert Walker Bush declared in 92 during the LA riots.
[01:22:05.325 --> 01:22:08.245]  And they've got universities saying, we're about to have a civil war.
[01:22:08.286 --> 01:22:09.106]  It's not a civil war.
[01:22:09.466 --> 01:22:13.787]  They're going to trigger a crisis to try to bring in a permanent coup.
[01:22:14.207 --> 01:22:16.327]  So that's how desperate these guys are.
[01:22:16.767 --> 01:22:19.188]  And America in the hands of these people fully?
[01:22:20.661 --> 01:22:22.329]  Is a disaster and we've got to stop it.
[01:22:24.175 --> 01:22:26.896]  You know, I don't think there should be term limits.
[01:22:26.996 --> 01:22:35.420]  I think that this system of, you know, elections every four years, it causes, you know, causes the incorrect people to take power in the United States.
[01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:37.481]  There's no system of meritocracy here.
[01:22:37.521 --> 01:22:42.084]  And I think it would benefit the United States a lot if we didn't have these corrupt systems.
[01:22:42.104 --> 01:22:43.204]  Like, what is that?
[01:22:43.244 --> 01:22:46.086]  They're saying that they're going to do another BLM, but worse.
[01:22:46.366 --> 01:22:48.747]  And then they're going to, I mean, BLM was a PSYOP.
[01:22:48.807 --> 01:22:50.948]  It was a color revolution on the American public.
[01:22:51.408 --> 01:22:54.491]  It's exactly what we do to every other country, but on the American public.
[01:22:54.551 --> 01:22:58.314]  Yeah, the CIA runs coups everywhere, and that's it, and they did it in Brazil, and now they're doing it here.
[01:22:58.774 --> 01:23:15.268]  Yes, so, and now they're saying, they're saying, just like they tell Thomas Sankara, just like they tell these leaders all across the world that face coups, Gaddafi, whoever it is, they tell them, no, you can't defend yourself, you can't fight for your sovereignty or else we're going to come in and assassinate you, put you in prison, whatever they do.
[01:23:15.968 --> 01:23:17.029]  Now they're telling that to Trump.
[01:23:17.049 --> 01:23:19.691]  They're saying, we're going to do this again to America.
[01:23:19.711 --> 01:23:20.772]  It's going to be worse this time.
[01:23:20.792 --> 01:23:22.714]  And if you don't like it, we're going to put you in prison.
[01:23:23.255 --> 01:23:27.438]  People ask me, they say, well, they stole it from Trump three and a half years ago.
[01:23:27.498 --> 01:23:28.359]  How do they do it again?
[01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:31.702]  They say, why would they need martial law or civil war?
[01:23:32.583 --> 01:23:33.503]  We've had the top.
[01:23:34.545 --> 01:23:36.126]  Sadisticians on, election experts.
[01:23:37.026 --> 01:23:51.350]  If there's a flood and a giant landslide, they only have so many dead people that can vote, they only have such a large database compiled for 400 and something million dollars by Facebook, they run out of bullets.
[01:23:51.911 --> 01:23:58.353]  So a 60-65% landslide, they can't overcome that, so they're already preparing
[01:23:59.193 --> 01:24:02.195]  To then cause civil war in 190-something days.
[01:24:02.675 --> 01:24:04.716]  Put up on the screen, guys, how many days out?
[01:24:05.036 --> 01:24:06.457]  I mean, and I'm not just saying this to be alarmist.
[01:24:06.477 --> 01:24:08.178]  Folks, I don't say things to be alarmist.
[01:24:08.638 --> 01:24:09.478]  I want stability.
[01:24:09.798 --> 01:24:11.219]  We're 197 days out.
[01:24:11.259 --> 01:24:12.040]  I've got four children.
[01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:12.800]  I'm 50 years old.
[01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:14.101]  I don't want a war.
[01:24:14.541 --> 01:24:15.901]  I'm not looking for it.
[01:24:15.961 --> 01:24:17.202]  I'm not trying to scare you.
[01:24:17.702 --> 01:24:20.984]  They are legitimately preparing cyberattacks during the election.
[01:24:21.004 --> 01:24:22.565]  They're going to blame it on Russia and China.
[01:24:23.105 --> 01:24:24.526]  That's in Vault 7, they staged those.
[01:24:25.946 --> 01:24:28.708]  You know, the whole Edward Snowden information, which they admit is real.
[01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:33.904]  And they are preparing to trigger racial civil war in America!
[01:24:35.234 --> 01:24:39.797]  As the crisis to bring in this permanent dictatorship of the bureaucracy.
[01:24:40.557 --> 01:24:42.799]  So it's not just one person you've got to target like Hitler.
[01:24:43.239 --> 01:24:44.600]  It's a thousand head Hydra.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:51.884]  This is going to be the retaking of the Republic and the rebirth of freedom worldwide or it's going to be our death.
[01:24:51.944 --> 01:24:55.407]  I mean, we are literally on death watch right now.
[01:24:55.887 --> 01:25:03.952]  And I've carried out my every possible war game of what the globalists are doing with Russia and China and us and the borders.
[01:25:05.823 --> 01:25:12.506]  Even if they are able to set up a dictatorship in 190 days, that only makes their problems worse.
[01:25:13.066 --> 01:25:17.828]  And then we're in a real hell, and Klaus Schwab said we'll make it an angrier world where you blame your politicians.
[01:25:17.848 --> 01:25:18.548]  No, we're going to blame them.
[01:25:18.828 --> 01:25:20.289]  We're going to blame the Bill Gateses.
[01:25:20.589 --> 01:25:21.429]  We're good to go.
[01:25:43.519 --> 01:26:04.803]  It's popular to do, but then you have people like Zuckerberg, who are acting like they're a part of the team, acting like they're pro-human, and then they're still censoring, they're still leaking information from their platforms to foreign governments, so they can drone strike little babies in different countries, they're still doing all that, but he's going to the UFC fights, you know, he's looking cool.
[01:26:05.483 --> 01:26:07.944]  He's got a tan, a beard, a gold chain.
[01:26:08.324 --> 01:26:12.465]  But then he has the bunkers with the paramilitary units in Hawaii, like you said, you know, it's like...
[01:26:13.522 --> 01:26:18.727]  Oh, when I go to Hawaii, I go there because I love it, but also the Hawaiians love me.
[01:26:19.207 --> 01:26:23.070]  And I mean, I'm not going to, like, I'm literally with the real people that run it.
[01:26:23.090 --> 01:26:24.011]  They're like, what do we do?
[01:26:24.572 --> 01:26:32.238]  And they explained to me, and they show me, and we open a plane and it follows, I'm releasing it, and it's like dozens of dump trucks leaving, dump trucks coming in.
[01:26:32.279 --> 01:26:38.224]  They go, he's been there three years building a 10-story base with a super villain escape submarine.
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:42.521]  And he's got combat troops, combat robots, everything.
[01:26:43.041 --> 01:26:44.841]  Dude, that's not your exit plan.
[01:26:44.881 --> 01:26:46.502]  It's saving civilization.
[01:26:46.522 --> 01:26:50.083]  Well, all those people, all the paramilitary are going to turn on him.
[01:26:50.283 --> 01:26:50.843]  Oh, exactly.
[01:26:51.583 --> 01:26:53.303]  Oh, they're going to run that in five minutes.
[01:26:53.343 --> 01:26:53.623]  Yeah.
[01:26:53.963 --> 01:26:54.183]  Yeah.
[01:26:54.324 --> 01:26:55.404]  No, it's not going to go anywhere.
[01:26:55.424 --> 01:26:58.765]  The minute the nukes drop, they're going to... Zuckerberg's going to get shot in the back of the head.
[01:26:58.825 --> 01:26:59.605]  I'm not calling for this.
[01:26:59.845 --> 01:27:00.045]  No.
[01:27:00.225 --> 01:27:00.865]  He's dead.
[01:27:01.285 --> 01:27:01.485]  Yeah.
[01:27:01.885 --> 01:27:02.565]  In five minutes.
[01:27:04.186 --> 01:27:04.386]  Yeah.
[01:27:06.181 --> 01:27:09.222]  Yeah, I think gulags are a better option than just killing people.
[01:27:09.262 --> 01:27:11.922]  My point is, I don't even want that.
[01:27:12.343 --> 01:27:17.464]  But he literally lays the target in a pit like Hitler in the Reich Chancellery.
[01:27:17.504 --> 01:27:19.104]  He's built a big grave for himself.
[01:27:19.124 --> 01:27:20.005]  It's not going to go well.
[01:27:21.225 --> 01:27:22.045]  But that's what I'm saying.
[01:27:22.085 --> 01:27:23.385]  They do these ops.
[01:27:23.405 --> 01:27:24.466]  They try to act cool.
[01:27:24.506 --> 01:27:25.846]  They try to act like they're normal.
[01:27:25.906 --> 01:27:27.887]  He's doing UFC now, or MMA training.
[01:27:28.547 --> 01:27:30.447]  And at the end of the day, they're still all globalists.
[01:27:30.467 --> 01:27:31.328]  Yeah, pull up the photo.
[01:27:31.348 --> 01:27:31.628]  I tweeted it.
[01:27:31.648 --> 01:27:32.788]  I said, he's a real boy now.
[01:27:33.348 --> 01:27:34.329]  Don't go to my ex-account.
[01:27:34.510 --> 01:27:35.931]  Pull up him with the gold star.
[01:27:35.951 --> 01:27:36.232]  Go ahead.
[01:27:36.252 --> 01:27:36.652]  Gold chain.
[01:27:37.193 --> 01:27:39.376]  Yeah, that photo's terrifying.
[01:27:41.398 --> 01:27:46.064]  But, you know, the thing about that movie is you find it interesting.
[01:27:46.124 --> 01:27:47.986]  That movie and the Napoleon.
[01:27:48.006 --> 01:27:49.007]  You see the Napoleon movie?
[01:27:49.890 --> 01:27:50.210]  Excellent.
[01:27:50.970 --> 01:27:52.191]  You thought Napoleon was excellent?
[01:27:52.631 --> 01:27:55.012]  I thought overall it was, I mean, it was well done, yeah.
[01:27:55.992 --> 01:28:00.554]  Well, the thing with this movie is it was made by a British producer, if I'm not mistaken.
[01:28:00.594 --> 01:28:03.895]  It's like, why is a... this is just so insane.
[01:28:04.015 --> 01:28:07.776]  If a Chinese producer, if a Russian producer... No, no, no, be honest.
[01:28:07.836 --> 01:28:11.777]  I'm not saying it was... but I thought overall it was an interesting film.
[01:28:11.977 --> 01:28:12.417]  Napoleon?
[01:28:12.938 --> 01:28:13.738]  The critics didn't like it.
[01:28:14.761 --> 01:28:21.643]  I just thought they made him look very weak and cuckish and subservient and, you know... Oh, I picked up on that.
[01:28:21.743 --> 01:28:27.845]  But I think historically... Well, historically, I mean, they had him blowing bombs at the Great Pyramids.
[01:28:27.866 --> 01:28:28.666]  That never happened.
[01:28:28.866 --> 01:28:29.726]  They just made that up.
[01:28:30.887 --> 01:28:32.927]  It happened pretty far away from the Great Pyramids.
[01:28:33.007 --> 01:28:37.509]  And then also, the use of CGI was just a little bit over the top.
[01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:42.150]  I mean, like, I'm a fan of the Patriots, so... I love that, too.
[01:28:42.410 --> 01:28:43.711]  There's Zuckerberg right there.
[01:28:45.522 --> 01:28:50.446]  Hey, the robot is put on camouflage.
[01:28:50.466 --> 01:28:54.829]  Alright, let's come back and talk about where this is all going with Jackson Hinkle.
[01:28:55.189 --> 01:28:55.590]  Stay with us.
[01:28:59.022 --> 01:29:02.746]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[01:29:03.086 --> 01:29:06.249]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[01:29:06.649 --> 01:29:11.113]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[01:29:11.734 --> 01:29:13.876]  But we're not just exposing their operation.

[01:29:22.785 --> 01:29:24.106]  This is the Great Awakening.
[01:29:24.626 --> 01:29:28.511]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[01:29:28.991 --> 01:29:32.515]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.

[01:32:50.156 --> 01:32:55.560]  And while you're at it, get TurboForce 10 hours of clean energy at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:32:55.940 --> 01:32:57.822]  Both of them discounted right now.
[01:33:00.327 --> 01:33:06.249]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[01:33:19.972 --> 01:33:24.095]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:24.816 --> 01:33:26.377]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:26.658 --> 01:33:35.405]  Now I picked up the cut part of the weak male in Napoleon that Jackson Ingalls talked about, but I've been overall compared to what I expect from Hollywood, but I didn't promote it.
[01:33:35.465 --> 01:33:37.587]  It was overall, a lot of it was historical.
[01:33:37.647 --> 01:33:41.930]  I'd say 90% accurate, but the Russians, you know, burned down their major cities so they don't get control of it.
[01:33:41.950 --> 01:33:46.194]  But in the time we've got left here, points you want to make.
[01:33:46.214 --> 01:33:46.774]  You're a smart guy.
[01:33:46.794 --> 01:33:47.475]  I watch your show.
[01:33:48.769 --> 01:33:53.991]  Even though I don't agree with where you politically want to go, your observations I think are dead on.
[01:33:54.812 --> 01:33:56.192]  You've got the floor, what do you want to say to folks?
[01:33:58.233 --> 01:34:02.455]  I want to say if you live in America, we're living in a very, very, very scary time.
[01:34:02.515 --> 01:34:06.597]  Not just because we have Joe Biden, not just because we've got this looming election.
[01:34:08.278 --> 01:34:14.761]  It's a banana republic we're living in, but I think the biggest problems that we need to reckon with are the fact that
[01:34:16.157 --> 01:34:28.280]  Maybe you have disagreements with me on this, but as more and more countries join BRICS, the New Development Bank, we've got 40 countries that are going to be applying to join BRICS this June.
[01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:29.781]  No, that's just a fact.
[01:34:29.881 --> 01:34:34.302]  Everything the West has done under Biden has accelerated the end of the American empire.
[01:34:34.662 --> 01:34:39.666]  But you're talking about these Middle Eastern oil giants, gas giants that are now going to be part of this.
[01:34:39.686 --> 01:34:40.767]  We already got Iran in there.
[01:34:40.827 --> 01:34:44.990]  Seven of the top ten oil producing nations are already in BRICS.
[01:34:45.190 --> 01:34:47.912]  Only two of the top ten are G7 nations.
[01:34:48.512 --> 01:34:50.534]  That means the dollar's going to collapse.
[01:34:50.654 --> 01:34:52.455]  The dollar is going to be coming to an end.
[01:34:53.016 --> 01:35:00.761]  And we have to have smart people who are willing to come together and learn from history as to what actually works for picking up the pieces of this country when it collapses.
[01:35:01.762 --> 01:35:07.889]  And it's none of this, you know, BS fiat currency stuff that we're currently working with.
[01:35:07.949 --> 01:35:12.974]  I mean, we're going to have to look at, you know, commodity backed currencies.
[01:35:12.994 --> 01:35:16.658]  We're going to have to look at massive reindustrialization of our country.
[01:35:16.678 --> 01:35:18.019]  We're going to have to look at all this stuff.
[01:35:19.901 --> 01:35:31.591]  Ultimately, the real truth is that if we do do that, we're going to have NATO on our borders, we're going to have people who are trying to destroy us from within, we are going to have a real fight on our hands.
[01:35:31.931 --> 01:35:36.034]  And I don't want that, I don't think anyone is suggesting that or promoting that, but that's just the truth.
[01:35:36.235 --> 01:35:48.705]  If the Patriots take control, as you always say Alex, if 70-76 spirit really comes to this country, we're going to have a lot of enemies on our hands that are going to be trying to stop us with every single step.
[01:35:50.885 --> 01:35:55.386]  Well, there's no doubt that globalism, transhumanism is the main attack.
[01:35:55.446 --> 01:36:07.849]  We hear about Hitler all day, and the fascism, and anybody that's pro-family is Hitler, and it's ridiculous in the ADL and what they're doing, and they're allied with radical Islam, and then we hear about communism is going to get us.
[01:36:07.889 --> 01:36:13.370]  But really, global corporate technocracy promoting a transhumanist agenda.
[01:36:13.390 --> 01:36:17.031]  We're up against technocrats who are on a power trip,
[01:36:17.751 --> 01:36:19.812]  Looking for immortality, you're a transhumanist.
[01:36:19.872 --> 01:36:21.393]  Let's address the enemy.
[01:36:21.994 --> 01:36:25.957]  Think about if we didn't have X. If we didn't have X, I mean... Yeah, what's your view of Elon Musk?
[01:36:25.977 --> 01:36:26.577]  I'm going to test that.
[01:36:26.797 --> 01:36:36.043]  View of Elon Musk is, I think he's a very smart man, obviously, very successful businessman, and I think he understands everything that's happening.
[01:36:36.083 --> 01:36:39.025]  I mean, you see him post the memes about Iran and all the U.S.
[01:36:39.065 --> 01:36:40.606]  military bases around Iran.
[01:36:40.666 --> 01:36:42.327]  He says the stuff like,
[01:36:43.228 --> 01:36:47.050]  You know, Israel's the best recruiter for Hamas because they kill so many families.
[01:36:48.291 --> 01:36:53.494]  He understands this stuff, but he's a businessman first and foremost, so he puts his business first.
[01:36:53.715 --> 01:36:59.958]  And given that he's the richest man in the world, I guess you can't entirely fault him for having that frame of mind.
[01:37:00.058 --> 01:37:03.240]  And you can't fault him for knowing the old system's going down.
[01:37:03.501 --> 01:37:07.223]  You can say, well, he's an opportunist that sees they're failing, so he wants to jump over.
[01:37:07.703 --> 01:37:08.364]  Exactly!
[01:37:08.424 --> 01:37:13.709]  If we want to change culture and society, we can't be like, oh well, you weren't perfect before, I don't trust you.
[01:37:13.729 --> 01:37:16.552]  It doesn't mean we trust him, we watch his actions now, we're good.
[01:37:17.073 --> 01:37:18.654]  In Brazil, they're trying to arrest him.
[01:37:18.974 --> 01:37:19.995]  He's devastating.
[01:37:20.336 --> 01:37:26.642]  Now they admit the CIA funded Lula, who's a communist, on paper, against Bolsonaro, who's actually empowering the people.
[01:37:27.183 --> 01:37:28.944]  I mean, they are coming after Musk.
[01:37:29.004 --> 01:37:30.166]  It's not fake, it's real.
[01:37:30.686 --> 01:37:35.607]  Bolsonaro's interesting because at the end of his presidency, it seems like the deep state wanted to get rid of him.
[01:37:35.687 --> 01:37:41.508]  Bernie Sanders even said that they sent the CIA down there to secure the elections for Lula when he was coming in.
[01:37:41.528 --> 01:37:42.348]  And that's all come out?
[01:37:42.588 --> 01:37:46.209]  Yeah, but, but, Bolsonaro, what was he doing at the end of his presidency?
[01:37:46.649 --> 01:37:53.350]  He was forging very close and new ties with Russia and China, which he rejected at the start of his presidency.
[01:37:53.390 --> 01:37:55.231]  At the end, he was moving towards China again.
[01:37:55.251 --> 01:37:56.671]  Because, because,
[01:37:57.918 --> 01:37:59.720]  We already get all our goods from China anyways.
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:03.084]  Why not you Trump make him give us some of the money for American citizens?
[01:38:03.805 --> 01:38:04.926]  It's all about a better deal.
[01:38:05.627 --> 01:38:08.950]  And so, oh, we reject Russia and China so the middlemen get total control.
[01:38:09.771 --> 01:38:15.678]  That's what we have to exert our power so we're a fourth player instead of just sitting here mindlessly going along with it.
[01:38:16.098 --> 01:38:16.278]  Yeah.
[01:38:16.558 --> 01:38:17.719]  No, we have to.
[01:38:17.899 --> 01:38:22.640]  If we allow it to continue, America's going to crumble and we're going to be just left with ash and dust.
[01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:26.301]  We need America to be a very strong player in this world.
[01:38:26.321 --> 01:38:28.322]  Well, that's why I say the labels mean nothing.
[01:38:29.142 --> 01:38:33.924]  Lula, the current, with the Supreme Court making him a dictator, no one can run against him.
[01:38:34.944 --> 01:38:37.887]  He's a communist, but it's not, it doesn't even mean anything.
[01:38:38.208 --> 01:38:40.490]  He's a totally IMF, World Bank, and a globalist.
[01:38:41.171 --> 01:38:42.593]  I'm just saying these labels mean nothing.
[01:38:42.653 --> 01:38:43.534]  It's actions.
[01:38:43.854 --> 01:38:44.014]  Yeah.
[01:38:44.174 --> 01:38:45.956]  That's why people gotta study what's happening.
[01:38:46.397 --> 01:38:46.577]  Yeah.
[01:38:47.058 --> 01:38:48.619]  Well, I think you're 100% correct.
[01:38:48.659 --> 01:38:54.846]  He calls himself a socialist, and you know, you look at socialists, you look at communists, you look at all these different leaders, it's exactly right.
[01:38:54.866 --> 01:38:56.108]  You have to look at how they act.
[01:38:56.388 --> 01:39:00.712]  Whether they're willing to stand up to power, whether they're willing to challenge the sources of power.
[01:39:01.212 --> 01:39:02.614]  Lula's a pawn of the power.
[01:39:02.894 --> 01:39:05.676]  He was literally installed by the CIA in effect.
[01:39:06.017 --> 01:39:08.739]  Bernie Sanders admitted it on The Intercept with like Mehdi Hassan.
[01:39:08.859 --> 01:39:09.580]  It was crazy.
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:10.561]  It was crazy.
[01:39:11.201 --> 01:39:12.462]  So, you know, you look at this.
[01:39:12.482 --> 01:39:13.163]  And what does he want?
[01:39:13.303 --> 01:39:14.324]  Forced injections.
[01:39:15.205 --> 01:39:20.530]  Something like 100,000 parents had their kids grabbed under Lula until they took the shot.
[01:39:21.130 --> 01:39:23.554]  I mean, my God, your kid gets grabbed at school?
[01:39:23.775 --> 01:39:26.399]  You see the federal government said last week we're gonna force inject kids?
[01:39:26.499 --> 01:39:27.981]  Yeah.
[01:39:28.669 --> 01:39:30.150]  I don't know, I call that evil.
[01:39:30.230 --> 01:39:32.430]  Not communist, not fascist, not transhumanist.
[01:39:32.730 --> 01:39:33.831]  These labels are distracting.
[01:39:34.171 --> 01:39:36.112]  It's capitalist, but it's not capitalist.
[01:39:36.412 --> 01:39:39.993]  And it says we own your body and we're going to take your kids and force inject them.
[01:39:40.653 --> 01:39:43.094]  Let's get past labels and let's say no to Trotskys.
[01:39:43.154 --> 01:39:43.654]  Trotskys.
[01:39:44.014 --> 01:39:46.455]  And you know, the thing about Lula also... Oh, you don't just say that.
[01:39:46.895 --> 01:39:52.977]  Trotskyism is a virus that infected American Republican Party and is the neocons.
[01:39:53.037 --> 01:39:55.238]  It's not debated in people that read National History.
[01:39:55.838 --> 01:39:57.939]  It's literal the ghost of Trotsky.
[01:39:58.854 --> 01:40:05.304]  Yeah, I think if Stalin had gotten rid of more of the Trotskyists, I think we'd have far less problems in America.
[01:40:05.564 --> 01:40:06.385]  I think that's the truth.
[01:40:06.445 --> 01:40:07.567]  I don't think we'd have these neocons.
[01:40:07.607 --> 01:40:08.188]  Oh, there's no doubt.
[01:40:08.789 --> 01:40:09.810]  I don't think we'd have any of these.
[01:40:09.850 --> 01:40:12.494]  I'm not a fan of Joseph Stalin, but I'm a fan of him going after Trotskyites.
[01:40:12.614 --> 01:40:13.596]  I wish that none of them got out.
[01:40:15.237 --> 01:40:19.239]  I think they missed some of the banderites in Ukraine too, given what we're seeing today.
[01:40:19.859 --> 01:40:35.024]  But the thing I wanted to, last thing I wanted to say about Lula, that the reason why the United States loves Lula and loves India so much is because they are big countries, they are countries with lots of resources, but they're big and weak.
[01:40:35.504 --> 01:40:39.446]  They don't have... That's the difference between them and Russia and China.
[01:40:40.069 --> 01:40:41.850]  I'm going to skip this break, but explain that.
[01:40:42.330 --> 01:40:50.935]  And I would say China has a billion, 300 million people, really smart folks, dominates rare earth minerals because the West put them in that position when they were setting up a middleman operation.
[01:40:50.955 --> 01:40:53.136]  So I see China as the real globalist client.
[01:40:53.716 --> 01:41:00.140]  Russia left that system, I see as the true outlier, not saying they're perfect, but truly not under that system.
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:04.943]  That's why it's the number one enemy of the Hollywood, the Rob Reiners, and the George Soros's of the world.
[01:41:06.272 --> 01:41:07.893]  Explain how big Russia is.
[01:41:07.953 --> 01:41:11.175]  I mean, it's bigger than Africa geographically, and it's one country.
[01:41:11.355 --> 01:41:11.915]  Yeah.
[01:41:12.036 --> 01:41:13.016]  Africa's a continent.
[01:41:13.416 --> 01:41:15.097]  Russia's a country bigger than a continent.
[01:41:15.798 --> 01:41:17.159]  The land mass is incredible.
[01:41:17.219 --> 01:41:17.699]  It's huge.
[01:41:17.799 --> 01:41:27.325]  I mean, you've got, basically, in Russia, you've got, they have 89 different regions, and, you know, they're adding new ones each and every day.
[01:41:27.385 --> 01:41:29.886]  As Putin says, Russia's borders are limitless.
[01:41:30.167 --> 01:41:31.207]  I saw a statistic.
[01:41:31.227 --> 01:41:34.009]  They have like nine Rocky Mountains, basically.
[01:41:34.269 --> 01:41:35.230]  Yeah.
[01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:40.154]  So there's a there's a Russian regions exhibit at this place called Vitya Nahal in Moscow.
[01:41:40.634 --> 01:41:41.315]  And you go there.
[01:41:41.475 --> 01:41:42.496]  That's where I want to go.
[01:41:42.556 --> 01:41:44.277]  Not because I want to see.
[01:41:44.397 --> 01:41:44.698]  Yes.
[01:41:45.218 --> 01:41:47.220]  I imagine 90 percent of people.
[01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:48.000]  What is that?
[01:41:48.180 --> 01:41:48.401]  Yes.
[01:41:48.501 --> 01:41:54.265]  You go there and they have each different region and they have people from each region and they have photos, videos, things you can interact with.
[01:41:54.305 --> 01:41:55.706]  And it's like that's Lake Tahoe.
[01:41:55.747 --> 01:41:56.587]  This is the Rockies.
[01:41:56.627 --> 01:41:57.688]  This is West Virginia.
[01:41:57.748 --> 01:41:58.829]  This is Phoenix.
[01:41:59.590 --> 01:42:00.630]  You see all the different.
[01:42:01.351 --> 01:42:05.116]  Parts of America multiplied times five in all these different regions.
[01:42:05.196 --> 01:42:10.262]  It's, you know, it's why Russia has so many minerals that they're still finding all this gold and silver.
[01:42:10.302 --> 01:42:12.705]  And we should be an economic deal instead of war.
[01:42:12.865 --> 01:42:13.526]  Oh my God.
[01:42:13.767 --> 01:42:14.367]  I mean, we care.
[01:42:14.387 --> 01:42:15.208]  It's like, hmm.
[01:42:15.549 --> 01:42:15.889]  You'd think.
[01:42:16.590 --> 01:42:17.430]  But that's not what they want.
[01:42:17.691 --> 01:42:18.831]  They want total control.
[01:42:19.351 --> 01:42:19.952]  Total control.
[01:42:19.992 --> 01:42:22.873]  They will not settle for peace with an economic deal.
[01:42:22.893 --> 01:42:24.054]  Well, they want to tell us clear resources.
[01:42:24.374 --> 01:42:26.815]  Humans congregate together because that's where business is.
[01:42:27.115 --> 01:42:30.737]  You fly on an airplane over America, 90% of it's empty, just like Russia.
[01:42:30.757 --> 01:42:31.237]  Yeah.
[01:42:31.518 --> 01:42:33.058]  But it's five times, four times bigger.
[01:42:33.278 --> 01:42:39.582]  And then they tell you that we, you know, you have these people go out and tell you that we don't have enough resources to sustain life on Earth.
[01:42:39.642 --> 01:42:43.644]  It's like, no, we have enough resources to sustain, like,
[01:42:44.737 --> 01:42:51.180]  I've seen the time-lapse videos in Russia where a plane flies for three hours at night and you see no lights.
[01:42:52.181 --> 01:42:53.762]  A plane's going 600 miles an hour.
[01:42:54.022 --> 01:42:55.242]  There's nothing down there.
[01:42:55.502 --> 01:42:57.864]  We've got plenty of land, plenty of resources.
[01:42:57.924 --> 01:42:59.765]  We could sustain a hundred billion people.
[01:42:59.805 --> 01:43:00.565]  Like, I don't care.
[01:43:00.745 --> 01:43:02.486]  We can have as many people as we want.
[01:43:02.786 --> 01:43:05.407]  And technology will allow that to happen eventually.
[01:43:05.427 --> 01:43:07.789]  I mean, that's what's going to happen if the globalists don't get their way.
[01:43:08.649 --> 01:43:10.570]  We'll turn the North Pole green.
[01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:12.231]  The South Pole.
[01:43:13.648 --> 01:43:14.569]  I think that's good.
[01:43:14.829 --> 01:43:19.011]  I mean, I think it'd be really cool to have, like, you know, trade and everything.
[01:43:19.071 --> 01:43:20.731]  And the North's ice, but you still do it.
[01:43:20.771 --> 01:43:21.732]  But the South, you do.
[01:43:22.352 --> 01:43:28.775]  Well, Putin says that, right, he said that the North is the future of Russian economy.
[01:43:29.235 --> 01:43:33.657]  And they're investing heavily in all that stuff and making sure that they can do trade through it.
[01:43:33.857 --> 01:43:37.859]  Well, carbon tax is about, you know, knocking out Americans and Russians.
[01:43:38.919 --> 01:43:39.299]  How so?
[01:43:39.799 --> 01:43:41.160]  Well, cutting off the resources.
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:44.081]  I mean, even Elon Musk says, we can't get rid of carbon.
[01:43:44.101 --> 01:43:44.581]  We need that.
[01:43:44.801 --> 01:43:49.463]  But how does a carbon tax impact, in America, impact Russia negatively?
[01:43:49.483 --> 01:43:52.485]  Because it hasn't worked so far, but they thought that would cut them off.
[01:43:52.945 --> 01:43:54.265]  Interesting.
[01:43:54.385 --> 01:43:56.386]  All their policies are failures.
[01:43:56.406 --> 01:43:58.427]  But the sanctions made Russia make more money.
[01:43:58.707 --> 01:43:59.187]  Oh, yeah.
[01:43:59.427 --> 01:44:05.170]  Yeah, Russia's economy is on track to be the fastest growing in Europe this year.
[01:44:05.590 --> 01:44:07.931]  It's the... Which shows why the globalists are stupid.
[01:44:08.726 --> 01:44:14.271]  According to GDP Purchasing Power Parity, Russia has the fifth largest economy on Earth.
[01:44:14.311 --> 01:44:17.494]  That's like the first time that's happened in 14 years or something.
[01:44:17.654 --> 01:44:19.095]  Yeah, usually it's not as big as California.
[01:44:19.215 --> 01:44:23.719]  It's the largest country, largest economy in all of Europe right now.
[01:44:23.739 --> 01:44:28.883]  And by the way, how is a country four times the size of the US have a GDP of California?
[01:44:28.923 --> 01:44:29.284]  They lie.
[01:44:30.253 --> 01:44:34.636]  You get people like Dan Crenshaw that go out and say, oh it's just a gas station with nukes.
[01:44:34.716 --> 01:44:36.157]  It's like, Dan Crenshaw, what do you know?
[01:44:36.437 --> 01:44:39.159]  You know, it's like, you know nothing about Russia.
[01:44:39.179 --> 01:44:42.101]  Look, they got a video of Dan Crenshaw doing bad stuff.
[01:44:42.721 --> 01:44:43.122]  Of course.
[01:44:43.762 --> 01:44:44.162]  Of course.
[01:44:45.323 --> 01:44:49.066]  I don't know that, but I think one look, that guy is a monster.
[01:44:49.326 --> 01:44:49.546]  Yeah.
[01:44:50.086 --> 01:44:52.488]  He's, you know, he's a veteran.
[01:44:52.688 --> 01:44:53.789]  Did he lose his eye in war?
[01:44:55.293 --> 01:45:01.256]  All I know is the guy is, he gets up and says, I'm the most conservative member of Congress, don't believe the other people that are against me.
[01:45:01.556 --> 01:45:02.937]  You look at his voting record, it's horrible.
[01:45:03.677 --> 01:45:08.420]  People say America first, and then they say Ukraine second, Israel third, so on and so forth.
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:10.861]  It's like, no, America, I don't even like that.
[01:45:10.901 --> 01:45:12.022]  I like free America.
[01:45:12.142 --> 01:45:14.963]  Free America from any foreign influence, any foreign aid.
[01:45:15.003 --> 01:45:16.304]  But America's not first.
[01:45:16.424 --> 01:45:17.805]  Ukraine gets $60 billion.
[01:45:18.665 --> 01:45:19.465]  Israel gets $21 billion.
[01:45:20.986 --> 01:45:22.548]  I mean, have you seen the bill they just passed?
[01:45:22.988 --> 01:45:34.639]  What I'm saying is, I like America First, but I think when you say America First, and then, like, you know, I like Patrick, but David, but I think he did a video this week where he was saying, I support America First, but I support Israel Second, or something.
[01:45:34.679 --> 01:45:39.843]  And it's like, well, that's really like, America First means zero to the other countries.
[01:45:39.903 --> 01:45:40.944]  I totally agree with you.
[01:45:41.885 --> 01:45:43.747]  It's not America First, it's America Free.
[01:45:44.227 --> 01:45:44.427]  Yeah.
[01:45:44.808 --> 01:45:45.448]  Free America.
[01:45:45.909 --> 01:45:46.489]  Free America.
[01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:50.576]  I just launched an organization, Institute for a Free America.
[01:45:50.596 --> 01:45:52.318]  We're doing live shows across the country.
[01:45:52.419 --> 01:45:54.181]  May 24th, Dearborn, Michigan.
[01:45:54.302 --> 01:45:55.003]  You host it?
[01:45:55.143 --> 01:45:57.827]  I'm going to take a piss.
[01:45:58.168 --> 01:45:59.530]  You talk to folks you're hosting right now.
[01:46:01.423 --> 01:46:04.005]  Well, give me a topic.
[01:46:04.025 --> 01:46:05.666]  Anything you want to cover.
[01:46:05.686 --> 01:46:06.527]  Alright, alright.
[01:46:07.207 --> 01:46:07.888]  Let's see here.
[01:46:09.829 --> 01:46:10.810]  Anything I want to cover.
[01:46:10.850 --> 01:46:20.197]  Let's cover something that Alex and I briefly talked about yesterday in our interview that's going to be available on my ex-accounts in the next three days.
[01:46:20.297 --> 01:46:22.698]  We talked about the subject of Africa.
[01:46:23.299 --> 01:46:26.922]  I asked Alex the question, I said, you know, if you'd asked anyone a hundred years ago
[01:46:27.915 --> 01:46:31.559]  You know, do you think China is going to become the number one superpower in the world?
[01:46:31.619 --> 01:46:36.504]  And I know people don't like China, but the truth is, according to GDP Purchasing Power Parity, they are.
[01:46:37.064 --> 01:46:38.966]  They're the number one manufacturing power.
[01:46:39.006 --> 01:46:40.428]  They are the number one economy.
[01:46:41.149 --> 01:46:43.111]  You look at the U.S.
[01:46:43.151 --> 01:46:45.213]  economy, 95% of the U.S.
[01:46:45.253 --> 01:46:46.194]  economy is just fake.
[01:46:46.734 --> 01:46:49.856]  It's stock buybacks, it's these debt traps.
[01:46:49.916 --> 01:46:51.137]  I mean, it's literally nothing.
[01:46:51.757 --> 01:46:53.638]  Think about the average American worker.
[01:46:53.658 --> 01:46:54.879]  What do they do when they go to work?
[01:46:54.919 --> 01:47:01.443]  They do like marketing for an LGBTQ-friendly insurance company.
[01:47:01.463 --> 01:47:02.523]  It's like, what even is that?
[01:47:02.563 --> 01:47:03.604]  It's nothing, right?
[01:47:04.144 --> 01:47:06.145]  China's producing, Russia's producing.
[01:47:06.726 --> 01:47:11.609]  And the point I was trying to make when I asked this question to Alex, I said, what do you think about the future for Africa?
[01:47:12.455 --> 01:47:19.277]  Because Africa's kind of in a similar position today as China was a hundred years ago.
[01:47:19.297 --> 01:47:22.198]  I mean, huge population, huge amounts of resources.
[01:47:22.838 --> 01:47:24.139]  And I was curious to hear his answer.
[01:47:24.159 --> 01:47:30.941]  And he said, look, I think Africa is, you know, I'm paraphrasing what he said, but Africa is in some way the future.
[01:47:31.101 --> 01:47:32.421]  You know, Africa will develop.
[01:47:32.521 --> 01:47:33.662]  Africa is the future.
[01:47:34.542 --> 01:47:40.924]  You get these crazy people, you know, online that say, well, Africa, you know, Africans have low IQ.
[01:47:41.144 --> 01:47:42.424]  They have low IQ, you know.
[01:47:42.444 --> 01:47:44.305]  Well, sorry, IQ is fake.
[01:47:44.325 --> 01:47:45.185]  They just made it up.
[01:47:45.265 --> 01:47:47.426]  I mean, if you actually look at IQ tests, it's all fake.
[01:47:48.106 --> 01:47:49.526]  And I thought his answer was really cool.
[01:47:49.566 --> 01:47:51.787]  Maybe we'll get him to talk a little bit more about the future.
[01:47:53.817 --> 01:47:55.278]  Well, I mean, look, IQ is a complex issue.
[01:47:55.359 --> 01:47:57.641]  It really is designed for people that are already in that culture.
[01:47:57.661 --> 01:47:58.401]  It's a very limited test.
[01:48:12.535 --> 01:48:24.898]  You can take white people, or you can take Hispanics or Asians, and stick them in a starvation situation where they get half the calories they need in a low-fat diet with their children, and their brains are going to be smaller, they're going to have low IQs.
[01:48:25.478 --> 01:48:34.440]  They've got major studies with animals and with humans, if you take them and give them a high-fat, healthy nutrient content, you need fat to grow a brain, the blacks are just as smart.
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:36.880]  Okay, so that's nature.
[01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:39.861]  If you give the blacks the fat they need,
[01:48:40.882 --> 01:48:46.143]  In development, the breast milk, which they want to take away from everybody, which is what brain, you know, oh, we got a formula.
[01:48:46.183 --> 01:48:47.164]  It's all about the scientists.
[01:48:47.844 --> 01:48:51.285]  American, whether you're black, white, Hispanic, Asian, mix, whatever.
[01:48:51.945 --> 01:48:53.905]  If you've been drinking formula, I'm not against the parents that did it.
[01:48:54.385 --> 01:48:55.886]  Some mothers can't give milk.
[01:48:56.286 --> 01:48:57.386]  The brain's much smaller.
[01:48:57.966 --> 01:48:59.887]  Like, wow, women have breasts for a reason.
[01:49:00.247 --> 01:49:01.467]  It's designed for you.
[01:49:02.427 --> 01:49:08.329]  That's why in the old days, they got a donkey, cows weren't the best, or you got a horse was closer to human or a goat.
[01:49:09.091 --> 01:49:16.220]  Or a sheep, and it would give a closer milk, and then you would go pay a farmer to give that to your child if you couldn't produce milk, and the child would be okay.
[01:49:16.721 --> 01:49:18.483]  Those are closer, high-fat deals.
[01:49:19.684 --> 01:49:20.786]  It's not the same with a cow.
[01:49:22.028 --> 01:49:24.530]  So the first big thing is, you've got to have fat.
[01:49:25.170 --> 01:49:26.651]  You've got to have that in development.
[01:49:26.731 --> 01:49:32.174]  So you take a white baby or a black baby, you don't give them fat, you're going to get a stupid person.
[01:49:32.675 --> 01:49:35.176]  So yeah, major low calories.
[01:49:35.357 --> 01:49:40.060]  I mean, you go to the Appalachians and stuff where the kids are malnourished and they're low IQ.
[01:49:43.166 --> 01:49:48.071]  Number one, Africans are hard-working compared to spoiled rotten Americans, whether they be black or white on average.
[01:49:48.571 --> 01:49:54.297]  And Africa's beautiful, and it's a real potential, and the Chinese know that, that's why they're there.
[01:49:54.317 --> 01:50:02.465]  Instead of exploiting Africa, we should be building up Africa and getting rid of, you love communism, but totalitarian regimes.
[01:50:04.526 --> 01:50:06.847]  And then we could make Africa a jewel.
[01:50:07.207 --> 01:50:11.388]  And I think the answer is to make all the world, from North Korea to areas of Africa, jewels.
[01:50:11.928 --> 01:50:15.549]  Show that everybody can make, because the potential is unlimited.
[01:50:15.809 --> 01:50:17.069]  And the globalists know that.
[01:50:17.429 --> 01:50:20.150]  That's why they're against the Renaissance, trying to suppress development.
[01:50:20.490 --> 01:50:22.471]  Because once we turn humanity loose, it's unlimited.
[01:50:22.611 --> 01:50:24.051]  Because you've got to have competition.
[01:50:24.953 --> 01:50:31.619]  I think that's the defining nature of these Chinese loans, is that they're not attached to anything.
[01:50:31.939 --> 01:50:32.780]  It's just a loan.
[01:50:33.300 --> 01:50:38.444]  They're structured in a much better way for the people.
[01:50:38.464 --> 01:50:42.187]  And China, Russia are forgiving Africa's loan every single week, it seems like.
[01:50:42.207 --> 01:50:43.508]  Well, I mean, look, bottom line.
[01:50:44.089 --> 01:50:45.210]  Babies need fat.
[01:50:46.071 --> 01:50:48.533]  They don't need boys in Bill Gates shots.
[01:50:49.448 --> 01:50:50.208]  They need fat.
[01:50:50.349 --> 01:50:59.714]  Some of these IQ tests they're giving out and using to judge entire countries' populations on their IQ levels, like, they're giving out IQ tests to, like, people who are illiterate.
[01:51:00.054 --> 01:51:01.135]  They can't even read the tests.
[01:51:01.455 --> 01:51:04.877]  These IQ... the studies are... It's not gaining their potential.
[01:51:05.157 --> 01:51:06.078]  Yes, yes.
[01:51:07.039 --> 01:51:11.724]  So, I don't know, I just think it's, I think it's silly when people bring that stuff up.
[01:51:11.744 --> 01:51:15.207]  But to the left, Sabotage says you need a test to fly an airplane.
[01:51:15.648 --> 01:51:18.991]  We have to figure out ways to boost that and then bring people in.
[01:51:19.051 --> 01:51:20.372]  But you don't create quotas to do it.
[01:51:21.133 --> 01:51:26.900]  What is your ideal diet?
[01:51:28.562 --> 01:51:29.403]  I'm not perfect.
[01:51:29.743 --> 01:51:30.764]  I've been under a lot of stress.
[01:51:31.726 --> 01:51:33.568]  I do things I shouldn't do, but I know the science.
[01:51:34.629 --> 01:51:36.411]  People should be eating 30-40% raw vegetables.
[01:51:40.855 --> 01:51:43.257]  60% of the best thing is red meat.
[01:51:43.797 --> 01:51:47.600]  And if it's not burned, then you don't get any of the trans fats or any of the toxins.
[01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:49.541]  And I know the statistics.
[01:51:49.561 --> 01:51:54.605]  It doesn't mean I'm perfect, because I still love mashed potatoes and whatever, and a bowl of cereal, which is poison.
[01:51:55.085 --> 01:52:01.670]  It's full of chemicals, too, because they spray it with Roundup, even the wheat they do now, when it's ripe so that fungus doesn't grow.
[01:52:02.090 --> 01:52:03.171]  But, you know, I mean, 60% red meat.
[01:52:06.893 --> 01:52:09.435]  40% raw vegetables with no oil on them.
[01:52:09.475 --> 01:52:11.137]  You do that, you're going to live to 100 years old.
[01:52:11.637 --> 01:52:12.738]  And your brain's going to be huge.
[01:52:12.798 --> 01:52:15.280]  When I was in Russia, I was traveling.
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:16.241]  I ate poorly.
[01:52:16.281 --> 01:52:18.723]  I went to the McDonald's equivalent in Russia.
[01:52:19.103 --> 01:52:20.665]  I had the room service and stuff.
[01:52:21.005 --> 01:52:22.546]  And I didn't watch what I was eating.
[01:52:22.626 --> 01:52:25.248]  I usually just eat a pretty heavily red meat diet.
[01:52:25.649 --> 01:52:28.031]  And I come back and I lost weight after eating... Oh, no, no.
[01:52:28.051 --> 01:52:34.376]  There have been American computer programmers and stuff that live in Eastern Europe eating bacon and five eggs and... Yeah.
[01:52:34.936 --> 01:52:37.859]  And they lose weight because there's not the hormones and chemicals.
[01:52:38.039 --> 01:52:39.200]  Yeah, it was crazy.
[01:52:39.420 --> 01:52:44.444]  And my colleague... Look at our ancestors, they ate pie twice a day and huge meals, and they were all skinny and healthy.
[01:52:44.524 --> 01:52:45.545]  It's the chemicals, brother.
[01:52:46.146 --> 01:52:47.707]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:52:49.068 --> 01:52:51.230]  My colleague, Hazal Dean, he had the same thing.
[01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:54.873]  He came back from Russia and he lost weight and we both ate the same thing.
[01:52:55.113 --> 01:52:57.355]  I mean, the Russians, they give you all the food you want.
[01:52:57.375 --> 01:53:00.477]  Unless they give hormones to the chickens, the pigs and the cows.
[01:53:01.397 --> 01:53:06.083]  That make them fatter, and they're full of antibiotics, so it does that to you.
[01:53:07.485 --> 01:53:09.028]  What do you think they have on Mike Johnson?
[01:53:11.591 --> 01:53:14.215]  I mean, look, not just his actions.
[01:53:14.235 --> 01:53:16.538]  You take one look at him, that's a disingenuous person.
[01:53:17.808 --> 01:53:21.410]  So the number one thing they blackmail you with is gay sex.
[01:53:21.890 --> 01:53:22.591]  I don't know that.
[01:53:23.831 --> 01:53:27.554]  But I kind of, my gaydar kind of goes off with him.
[01:53:28.414 --> 01:53:37.179]  So I wonder, I wonder if he's like, you know, in the, this is speculation, but I wonder if he's in the congressional chambers, you know, banging, banging the pages.
[01:53:38.300 --> 01:53:39.640]  But I mean, it's something like that.
[01:53:39.941 --> 01:53:45.984]  Well, the thing that scared me about the insider trading, but, you know, I'll just say gaydar, my pedo-dar goes off.
[01:53:46.124 --> 01:53:46.384]  Yeah.
[01:53:46.785 --> 01:53:49.807]  The thing that was scary about what Tucker said on... That's going to be a viral clip.
[01:53:50.707 --> 01:53:54.570]  Bipedo Radar is going off on Mike Johnson.
[01:53:56.092 --> 01:54:03.237]  I'm not saying he's raping kids, but if I was going to cast somebody for a movie, two guys are driving a van to kidnap kids, it's him and Brian Stelter.
[01:54:03.257 --> 01:54:04.658]  I'm not saying Brian Stelter does that.
[01:54:04.998 --> 01:54:13.625]  I'm just saying if I was going to cast somebody that runs a dungeon full of kidnapped kids and makes snuff films, Mike Johnson would be cast immediately as the lead star.
[01:54:15.029 --> 01:54:16.129]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:54:16.830 --> 01:54:17.510]  I think so.
[01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:19.630]  Think that'll make him sick the CIA on me a little more?
[01:54:19.830 --> 01:54:20.611]  I think so.
[01:54:21.651 --> 01:54:22.491]  I just say what I think.
[01:54:23.192 --> 01:54:26.913]  He's probably very good friends with that CIA officer that was coming after you.
[01:54:27.133 --> 01:54:37.356]  What do you think about like the physiognomy of that guy, of that CIA officer, like the way he looks, like what's the... I can't say on air how they scooped him up.
[01:54:38.345 --> 01:54:41.387]  But you know that group that split up before they shut down Veritas.
[01:54:41.407 --> 01:54:42.107]  It was Catholic fun.
[01:54:42.147 --> 01:54:42.747]  They're good guys.
[01:54:43.068 --> 01:54:44.288]  They're pro-life.
[01:54:44.649 --> 01:54:46.730]  They expose pornhub targeting kids.
[01:54:47.290 --> 01:54:49.031]  They only target pedophiles.
[01:54:51.652 --> 01:54:53.874]  So they were doing a dragnet on pedophiles.
[01:54:55.134 --> 01:54:56.034]  In D.C.
[01:54:56.154 --> 01:54:57.995]  and came up with this F.P.I.C.I.A.
[01:54:58.115 --> 01:54:59.455]  operative attacking me.
[01:54:59.475 --> 01:55:00.696]  That's how they found that guy?
[01:55:00.776 --> 01:55:03.637]  Well, I'm not saying he... I'm, you know... No, no, but that's how they found him.
[01:55:04.157 --> 01:55:06.098]  That's how... It was coming to some out... Wow.
[01:55:06.118 --> 01:55:08.218]  They were doing a pitot, dragged it... Wow.
[01:55:09.059 --> 01:55:09.259]  Yeah.
[01:55:09.599 --> 01:55:10.259]  I did not know that.
[01:55:10.299 --> 01:55:13.360]  So you, like, hook your line up for bass, you throw it in, you catch... Oh, my God.
[01:55:13.540 --> 01:55:14.960]  So he's not a bass.
[01:55:14.980 --> 01:55:16.301]  We're not saying... No.
[01:55:16.321 --> 01:55:17.081]  They got a different fish.
[01:55:17.101 --> 01:55:17.561]  Yeah.
[01:55:17.601 --> 01:55:17.921]  Probably.
[01:55:17.961 --> 01:55:18.261]  Wow.
[01:55:18.742 --> 01:55:20.122]  But, yeah, that's who they hauled up.
[01:55:20.622 --> 01:55:20.982]  Wow.
[01:55:21.202 --> 01:55:21.743]  Well, who else?
[01:55:21.883 --> 01:55:22.303]  I mean, you know...
[01:55:24.693 --> 01:55:26.095]  I mean, we know what we're up against here.
[01:55:26.695 --> 01:55:27.496]  That's incredible.
[01:55:27.857 --> 01:55:44.276]  And that's why, again, Tucker in that interview with Joe Rogan, he said, the people who seem to be the most feared of the intelligence community are the people on the oversight board for the intelligence community, because they know what they're capable of, they get the threats, and they've probably seen it used against certain members before.
[01:55:46.069 --> 01:55:48.852]  Well, people lionize the intelligence agencies.
[01:55:49.032 --> 01:55:50.053]  They're gigantic.
[01:55:50.113 --> 01:55:53.836]  It's like saying, my brother works at Walmart.
[01:55:54.016 --> 01:55:54.937]  I mean, it's that big.
[01:55:55.437 --> 01:55:57.579]  It's not like, oh, they're not like James Bond.
[01:55:57.960 --> 01:55:58.760]  They're like that guy.
[01:55:59.421 --> 01:56:03.445]  A big, soft, sick, evil spider hiding in the dark.
[01:56:04.465 --> 01:56:16.616]  But don't you think that there's those, you know, the dark money, the dark funded organizations that are probably smaller, that are, you know, tasked with, like, watching certain senators and congresspeople.
[01:56:16.656 --> 01:56:23.583]  There are probably some smaller organizations and factions that are targeted just on members of Congress.
[01:56:24.523 --> 01:56:27.206]  Oh, I would say most of the intelligence agencies target power.
[01:56:27.666 --> 01:56:27.866]  Yeah.
[01:56:28.227 --> 01:56:28.907]  I wouldn't even say
[01:56:29.788 --> 01:56:38.439]  And again, the average FBI agent, average CIA agents like doing analysis on the Kurds in Syria or they're doing analysis of bank robberies here.
[01:56:38.839 --> 01:56:39.820]  Most of them are good men and women.
[01:56:40.161 --> 01:56:42.483]  But at the top, it's all bad people.
[01:56:42.543 --> 01:56:45.207]  And the most common denominator is they rape kids.
[01:56:45.927 --> 01:56:46.108]  Yeah.
[01:56:47.153 --> 01:56:50.695]  Speaking of, one subject we didn't get to cover yesterday was Diddy.
[01:56:52.736 --> 01:56:55.917]  It's a whole, you asked me the question and I got a phone call, I had to take a break.
[01:56:56.418 --> 01:56:59.479]  I mean, no, I don't know if he worked with the CIA, but it's the same model.
[01:56:59.559 --> 01:57:00.860]  It's Jeffrey Epstein 2.0.
[01:57:01.140 --> 01:57:03.781]  I mean, it's all, Hollywood's full of that.
[01:57:04.481 --> 01:57:05.482]  It's all about compromise.
[01:57:06.932 --> 01:57:07.913]  It seems like what it was.
[01:57:08.294 --> 01:57:14.221]  I mean, you have someone as powerful as that and then he's just leveraging everyone based upon these videos he's taking.
[01:57:14.261 --> 01:57:15.202]  It's the same exact thing.
[01:57:15.723 --> 01:57:17.986]  Very informative interview, Jackson Hinkle.
[01:57:18.026 --> 01:57:21.450]  People can find you on X at Jackson Hinkle, at Jackson Hinkle.
[01:57:21.770 --> 01:57:22.551]  Thank you so much.
[01:57:22.671 --> 01:57:23.573]  22nd closing comment.
[01:57:24.127 --> 01:57:25.848]  Well, thank you for having me on.
[01:57:25.908 --> 01:57:27.269]  It's very surreal to be here.
[01:57:27.689 --> 01:57:30.190]  As I've said multiple times, I'm a big fan of your work.
[01:57:30.230 --> 01:57:31.211]  You're exposing the truth.

[01:57:42.417 --> 01:57:42.837]  All right.
