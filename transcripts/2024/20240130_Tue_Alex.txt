[00:00:03.462 --> 00:00:07.684]  We do not warn of false flags to try to predict horrible events.
[00:00:08.224 --> 00:00:10.985]  We warn of false flags to try and prevent them.
[00:00:11.405 --> 00:00:14.507]  They are the norm for starting massive conflicts.
[00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:19.929]  They are based on lies, and so we only hope that the truth will make them futile.
[00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:28.733]  Last week, I reported on rumors that Victoria Nuland was planning a false flag attack on a Ukrainian nuclear power plant.
[00:00:29.253 --> 00:00:39.336]  There is now talk in Kiev that the real president of Ukraine, Victoria Nuland, has become so desperate for NATO troops to enter Ukraine and continue this U.S.
[00:00:39.416 --> 00:00:47.278]  proxy war against Russia that she is willing to murder innocent locals with a radioactive cloud and blame it on Russian forces.
[00:00:48.198 --> 00:00:55.582]  After that report, documentary filmmaker Chris Emery, who has spent years researching PATCON, the U.S.
[00:00:55.622 --> 00:01:09.669]  intelligence operation to use false flags as a way of criminalizing American patriots, reached out to me with some information that shows how this is standard operating procedure for the black hats in our government.
[00:01:09.949 --> 00:01:18.054]  We had done our first movie premiere in March of that year in Salt Lake City with an attorney that we actually interviewed on the film by the name of Jesse Trinidou.
[00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:32.283]  He was approached by a command team leader that was in charge of 10, including himself, basically commandos, to blow up the Browns Ferry nuclear power plant in Athens, Alabama under the Operation PATCON.
[00:01:32.703 --> 00:01:43.203]  And then Jesse went into detail about what PATCON was, which would later morph into the Waco attack, and then the Oklahoma City bombing, and then our current, present-day
[00:01:45.385 --> 00:01:45.665]  I think?
[00:02:07.326 --> 00:02:11.229]  Partners, there were 10 commandos all together, were given duffel bags full of cash.
[00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:12.470]  Each were given $5 million.
[00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.452]  They left it in the parking lot in the wee hours.
[00:02:15.952 --> 00:02:24.179]  He said between 2.30 and 3 o'clock in the morning, they literally left these duffel bags in the parking lot, in the far end of the parking lot, away from the nuclear power plant and drove away.
[00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:29.163]  And they basically told their commanding officer at the Pentagon to F off.
[00:02:29.703 --> 00:02:33.166]  We're dealing with people that are of the occult, are in a dark...
[00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:37.924]  Dark corner of the universe that we can't even imagine.
[00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:42.249]  And Newland is in that pack with Eric Garland and several others.
[00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:43.531]  Without a doubt.
[00:02:44.692 --> 00:02:49.778]  She needs to be brought up on treason and indicted, put on trial and thrown in prison.
[00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:51.060]  And the key tossed away.
[00:02:51.420 --> 00:03:03.111]  We also spoke on the subject of what looks to be the beginning of a false flag being set up on the southern border, with World Economic Forum puppet Greg Abbott now calling for a civil war.
[00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:04.452]  What in the world?
[00:03:04.492 --> 00:03:07.154]  Why did it take him almost two and a half years to gear up?
[00:03:07.294 --> 00:03:07.755]  I think it's...
[00:03:09.458 --> 00:03:10.318]  It's disingenuous.
[00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:27.990]  Put the thumbscrew on that a long time ago.
[00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.911]  Why he chose to do so now is beyond me.
[00:03:31.051 --> 00:03:31.991]  They're much more keen.
[00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:45.856]  They have the operative radar on high alert now, and they'll be able to hopefully weed out a lot of these operatives that, whether they know it or not, are being paid by the feds to be the fly in the ointment and get a lot more people in trouble.
[00:03:45.936 --> 00:03:48.437]  It's just going to be a reincarnation of J6 all over again.
[00:03:48.857 --> 00:03:56.125]  Expert on false flags and the southern border crisis, Michael Yawn, is also warning people not to fall for the trap.
[00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:03.532]  And we already know that the so-called, I call it OGUS, the Occupational Government of the United States, we already know that it's out of control.
[00:04:03.592 --> 00:04:09.434]  We already know that the only rules that it plays by is anything it can get away with, it will do, right?
[00:04:09.654 --> 00:04:10.514]  We already know that.
[00:04:10.835 --> 00:04:17.457]  We saw January 6th, we see Americans have to show their ID and get searched and whatnot to get on airplanes.
[00:04:17.797 --> 00:04:21.438]  Meanwhile, they got illegals, I mean, straight-up invaders,
[00:04:21.938 --> 00:04:26.501]  Coming across the border by the thousands every day that can board aircraft without any ID.
[00:04:27.422 --> 00:04:28.483]  There are no rules.
[00:04:29.123 --> 00:04:30.544]  We are clearly being hunted.
[00:04:31.125 --> 00:04:35.088]  And, I mean, the American citizens, patriots, are clearly being hunted.
[00:04:35.368 --> 00:04:38.410]  They're looking for any excuse to go to war, and they will do it.
[00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.372]  I mean, obviously, there's going to be a very serious war.
[00:04:41.512 --> 00:04:42.493]  It's clearly coming.
[00:04:42.853 --> 00:04:44.194]  Don't walk into their tracks.
[00:04:44.515 --> 00:04:45.235]  Do not do it.
[00:04:45.956 --> 00:04:49.018]  Again, why would you go to Eagle Pass, which is so baited
[00:04:49.776 --> 00:04:52.678]  When Abbott clearly could close the border if he wanted to.
[00:04:53.138 --> 00:04:54.719]  This is clearly a wrestling match.
[00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:56.119]  This is clearly a show.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.760]  That's the Thunderdome.
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.141]  Don't go.
[00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:00.442]  Reporting for Infowars.
[00:05:01.222 --> 00:05:05.464]  The second American revolution is happening now right in front of you.
[00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:10.126]  And you're tuned in to Infowars because you're either looking for the truth or you're already a patriot.
[00:05:10.587 --> 00:05:18.431]  I'm asking you now to realize we are at the fulcrum, the crossroads in the fight for human destiny and human future.
[00:05:19.191 --> 00:05:19.972]  We're good to go.
[00:05:37.827 --> 00:05:39.488]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com from...
[00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.731]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:22.133 --> 00:06:30.655]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:47.180]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:52.021]  Welcome to this live Tuesday, January 30th, 2024 transmission.
[00:06:52.542 --> 00:06:53.942]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:53.962 --> 00:06:56.163]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:06:56.263 --> 00:06:59.344]  Our crew is now down at the Texas border.
[00:06:59.364 --> 00:07:12.770]  We're going to have live reports from there, and a lot of important reports being filed at InfoWars.com, and video, and of course, on Real Alex Jones and the InfoWars channel, as well as our other great host channels there on X, formerly Twitter.
[00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:19.454]  Okay, look, I was sitting here right before we went live looking at all this news, and I just want to say something.
[00:07:20.715 --> 00:07:22.717]  This morning I had some errands to take care of.
[00:07:23.597 --> 00:07:34.405]  I normally just drive straight to work, so I was driving around quite a bit this morning, so I listened to probably in traffic an hour and a half of talk radio.
[00:07:36.833 --> 00:07:50.086]  And I just sampled probably 15 different conservative radio shows in Austin, in San Antonio, in Dallas, because we get all those Texas Talk radio channels.
[00:07:51.508 --> 00:07:53.830]  And it was just so amateurish.
[00:07:55.091 --> 00:07:59.916]  And it was so hawkish and World War III-ish.
[00:08:02.182 --> 00:08:04.583]  And we've got to go ahead and just nuke Iran now.
[00:08:05.524 --> 00:08:07.625]  And World War III is going to be so wonderful.
[00:08:08.025 --> 00:08:17.789]  And I noticed World War III was trending number one this morning on X. I got up at 4.30 and was doing work around the house before my daughter got up, before my wife got up.
[00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:27.034]  And... I had it up on my big computer screen at my desk, and I was just...
[00:08:28.103 --> 00:08:31.064]  I probably spent an hour going through all the World War III stuff.
[00:08:31.745 --> 00:08:39.309]  And I saw prominent conservative channels, prominent conservative talk show hosts saying stuff like, World War III is the best option.
[00:08:39.349 --> 00:08:39.929]  That's a quote.
[00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:43.511]  I retweeted, posted one of those.
[00:08:45.432 --> 00:08:52.555]  And then I saw the majority of people telling those folks they're crazy, but also some saying, oh, you're just a Russian agent or you're an Iranian agent.
[00:08:53.336 --> 00:08:55.857]  What I am is an agent of not wanting nuclear war.
[00:08:57.312 --> 00:08:57.912]  We're good to go.
[00:09:28.353 --> 00:09:28.673]  We're good to go.
[00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:28.833]  I think?
[00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:53.291]  We're good to go.
[00:09:53.311 --> 00:09:53.851]  We're good to go.
[00:09:53.871 --> 00:09:54.291]  We're good to go.
[00:10:21.823 --> 00:10:34.578]  Vivek is going to be joining us coming up at the bottom of the hour to talk about this and the Trump campaign and a lot more.
[00:10:36.087 --> 00:10:44.391]  And then we have Doc Chambers, the great former Green Beret commander and medical doctor, coming on in the fourth hour, so I look forward to that.
[00:10:44.511 --> 00:10:48.313]  He's leading one of the main convoys down to the Texas border.
[00:10:48.333 --> 00:10:56.477]  In fact, the first convoy that will actually arrive there, the other big one going off the East Coast down to Florida and then over to Texas, will get there on Saturday.
[00:10:56.497 --> 00:10:59.238]  There's other big ones from California scheduled to get there on Sunday.
[00:10:59.518 --> 00:11:00.539]  We've got our reporters.
[00:11:02.506 --> 00:11:03.167]  We're good to go.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:28.761]  These people are crazy.
[00:11:53.334 --> 00:12:00.678]  And that dovetails with the new thing that came out yesterday afternoon with the press secretary, the black raggedy Ann.
[00:12:01.858 --> 00:12:06.821]  White House spokesman called out for odd condolence statement of three U.S.
[00:12:06.861 --> 00:12:09.882]  troops fighting and dying for the administration.
[00:12:11.583 --> 00:12:14.485]  Well, I remember the press reports at the time, because it was in the L.A.
[00:12:14.505 --> 00:12:14.805]  Times.
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.021]  We're good to go.
[00:12:17.341 --> 00:12:17.901]  We're good to go.
[00:12:29.884 --> 00:12:30.825]  And said, how dare them?
[00:12:30.865 --> 00:12:31.826]  They're threatening us.
[00:12:32.566 --> 00:12:38.691]  And Hillary pulled him by the arm in front of the press, saw it happen, some members of the press, and said, Ron, it's okay.
[00:12:39.171 --> 00:12:41.193]  They're under our control now.
[00:12:41.653 --> 00:12:42.654]  They work for us.
[00:12:42.974 --> 00:12:56.125]  Now, imagine the weird Los Angeles, L.A., New World Order, Hollywood mindset that they hate this country so much, and then even when they get control of it, they destroy it.
[00:12:57.045 --> 00:12:57.545]  We're good to go.
[00:13:24.065 --> 00:13:24.565]  We're good to go.
[00:13:53.826 --> 00:13:57.950]  And you have to understand, with these people, that's really their mindset.
[00:14:00.652 --> 00:14:05.617]  I liken it to the barbarians that finally conquered Rome in 410.
[00:14:07.158 --> 00:14:13.925]  And instead of occupying Rome and taking over its palaces, they just burned it all down.
[00:14:16.487 --> 00:14:17.528]  And so it'd be like if...
[00:14:18.933 --> 00:14:19.493]  We're good to go.
[00:14:19.513 --> 00:14:19.774]  I think?
[00:14:36.181 --> 00:14:36.341]  I think?
[00:15:05.261 --> 00:15:10.525]  They think something like Leave it to Beaver, and that's how my dad was brought up, that's how my mom was brought up.
[00:15:10.585 --> 00:15:12.327]  They're like people from Leave it to Beaver, okay?
[00:15:13.356 --> 00:15:13.876]  We're good to go.
[00:15:41.676 --> 00:15:52.058]  That this is a spiritual disease and that the left worldwide are basically NPCs set on a mission to burn down the world.
[00:15:52.598 --> 00:15:56.939]  All right, we got a ton of news lined up today and so much more.
[00:15:56.979 --> 00:15:57.479]  Stay with us.
[00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:04.400]  You know, I sit up here and I yell and scream about the New World Order and the globalists.
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:08.521]  They're planning to get rid of the borders and release a virus and have a global power grab.
[00:16:08.561 --> 00:16:09.561]  And you saw it all come true.
[00:16:10.731 --> 00:16:13.392]  But there's an inverse of that.
[00:16:14.132 --> 00:16:16.813]  There's not just the bad stuff I'm telling you about.
[00:16:16.833 --> 00:16:19.113]  There's the good stuff I'm telling you about.
[00:16:19.873 --> 00:16:24.515]  And just like our information is the best you're going to find out there, our supplements are amazing.
[00:16:25.155 --> 00:16:28.916]  So our new special in the last half of January 2024 is here.
[00:16:29.416 --> 00:16:33.777]  It's Real Red Pill Plus and DNA Force Plus, both 50% off.
[00:16:33.937 --> 00:16:37.018]  We're calling it the Supercharged Special.
[00:16:37.678 --> 00:16:43.520]  You can get either one of these great items at 40% off individually or together for 50% off.
[00:16:43.821 --> 00:16:47.702]  Now, in the time we have left, I can't tell you why they're so great and what they do for your body.
[00:16:48.122 --> 00:16:52.844]  Go to InfoWarsHore.com, look at the ingredients and investigate it, and then get them.
[00:16:53.144 --> 00:16:55.665]  It supports the InfoWar, and it'll change your life.

[00:17:00.047 --> 00:17:02.228]  Media Matters, the Democratic Party.
[00:17:03.155 --> 00:17:03.976]  I just want to say this.
[00:17:03.997 --> 00:17:04.417]  Go f*** yourselves.
[00:17:15.843 --> 00:17:22.168]  Alex Jones New World Order Wars has been number one on Steam thanks to the viewers and listeners of this broadcast.
[00:17:22.508 --> 00:17:35.718]  And I want to invite everyone, before they are successful at banning, which I hope they aren't, to go to alexjonesgame.com and follow the link to Steam and download this game for $17.76 as a message to the New World Order.
[00:17:36.438 --> 00:17:36.899]  F*** you.
[00:17:37.459 --> 00:17:45.446]  You want to try to ban this game just like you want to steal elections and force injections on us and open up our borders and rape us.
[00:17:45.867 --> 00:17:49.850]  This is a culture war and they're scared of this game.
[00:17:50.271 --> 00:17:58.998]  Get Alex Jones New World Order Wars right now at AlexJonesGame.com because anything badass gets censored!
[00:18:00.011 --> 00:18:03.732]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[00:18:04.072 --> 00:18:07.233]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[00:18:07.633 --> 00:18:12.094]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[00:18:12.735 --> 00:18:14.855]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[00:18:15.175 --> 00:18:23.137]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's You Will Eat the Bugs.
[00:18:23.778 --> 00:18:25.098]  This is The Great Awakening.

[00:19:00.871 --> 00:19:12.685]  We are in the middle of a crude and ugly communist revolution funded by the big banks as a battering ram into a new age digital economy and a total surveillance state.
[00:19:13.125 --> 00:19:18.631]  All branches of government are attacking we the people and they offer us only one option.
[00:19:18.932 --> 00:19:21.154]  A meaningless vote in a rigged election.
[00:19:22.035 --> 00:19:22.896]  We're good to go.
[00:19:44.728 --> 00:19:48.332]  Share them, upload them, and send them everywhere.
[00:19:49.033 --> 00:19:52.657]  Let the world unite for truth, justice, and 1776 worldwide.
[00:20:13.567 --> 00:20:18.072]  Vivek Ramaswamy is joining us to cover the waterfront coming up next segment.
[00:20:18.092 --> 00:20:23.277]  I'm going to cover what's happening with the border, economics, and more in the second hour.
[00:20:24.398 --> 00:20:30.985]  And in the third hour, we'll be taking your phone calls again in the second and third hour on this live Tuesday, January 30th broadcast.
[00:20:32.176 --> 00:20:34.997]  Well, let's dive right in to what's happening.
[00:20:35.137 --> 00:20:49.320]  Here's Joe Biden during the campaign a few years ago before he stole the election, saying that if Trump gets in, we're basically going to have massive war with Iran.
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.960]  Now, of course, it's the complete opposite.
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.681]  Now he's in there, and they're pushing for total war.
[00:20:55.233 --> 00:20:57.574]  The world has changed because what Trump has done.
[00:20:58.075 --> 00:21:03.398]  And the American people, including independents and some Republicans, know how bad he is.
[00:21:03.878 --> 00:21:05.619]  Know how much he's misrepresented.
[00:21:05.679 --> 00:21:07.881]  Know how he's getting close to getting us in a war.
[00:21:08.441 --> 00:21:12.463]  I said, as the walls close in on this man, I'm worried he's going to get us to war in Iran.
[00:21:13.024 --> 00:21:14.685]  Unfortunately, I may have been right.
[00:21:15.245 --> 00:21:18.107]  The fact of the matter is, there's a lot at stake in this election.
[00:21:19.429 --> 00:21:27.032]  All right, here is the Secretary of State yesterday saying that this is the most dangerous situation in a long time.
[00:21:28.513 --> 00:21:36.716]  I would argue that we've not seen a situation as dangerous as the one we're facing now across the region since at least 1973.
[00:21:39.258 --> 00:21:45.660]  Now, here is the State Department slash Pentagon spokesperson saying they have no evidence Iran's behind this.
[00:21:46.301 --> 00:21:46.921]  Let's be clear.
[00:21:48.217 --> 00:21:51.678]  Iran is giving weapons to these different Shiite militias.
[00:21:52.358 --> 00:21:53.138]  They're proxies.
[00:21:53.158 --> 00:21:54.519]  They're not in complete command of them.
[00:21:54.539 --> 00:21:56.639]  But Iran does not get a pass for this.
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:01.421]  And it's not good they killed three of our soldiers and injured 20-something others.
[00:22:02.281 --> 00:22:02.421]  Okay?
[00:22:02.441 --> 00:22:06.422]  And it's not good that they're proxies, the Houthis out of Yemen are attacking ships.
[00:22:07.423 --> 00:22:08.343]  So let's get that straight.
[00:22:09.628 --> 00:22:10.791]  Iran's out of control.
[00:22:11.272 --> 00:22:12.935]  Biden gave them $6 billion.
[00:22:13.416 --> 00:22:14.499]  They know Biden's weak.
[00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.684]  They're sucking us into a wider war.
[00:22:16.744 --> 00:22:17.586]  This is dangerous.
[00:22:17.626 --> 00:22:19.770]  The Iranian leadership are crazy.
[00:22:21.049 --> 00:22:21.529]  We're good to go.
[00:22:45.618 --> 00:22:48.319]  Of the Pentagon admitting that there's no evidence of Iran behind the attack.
[00:22:48.739 --> 00:22:55.580]  And yeah, Iran's not taking credit, which leans towards the fact that their proxy didn't do this under orders.
[00:22:55.921 --> 00:22:56.401]  Doesn't matter.
[00:22:56.441 --> 00:22:57.601]  They gave them the high-tech drone.
[00:22:58.121 --> 00:23:10.084]  But again, you've got the neocons and the Democratic leadership calling for a full-out war, and it's a bad sign that they didn't just hit a bunch of rebels with 100 airstrikes or something.
[00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:12.850]  That would be the right response.
[00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:14.491]  You know, 20 times what they did to us.
[00:23:15.191 --> 00:23:22.353]  A full attack on Iran will explode into a regional war guarantee that's already going on, and probably into full World War III.
[00:23:22.373 --> 00:23:23.593]  That's what most analysts believe.
[00:23:23.853 --> 00:23:25.393]  So that's where we are right now.
[00:23:25.473 --> 00:23:26.234]  Here's the Pentagon.
[00:23:26.254 --> 00:23:27.254]  Here's the State Department.
[00:23:28.294 --> 00:23:30.995]  Just to follow up, you said Iran was behind the attack.
[00:23:31.335 --> 00:23:32.135]  What does that mean?
[00:23:32.375 --> 00:23:37.676]  Have you seen evidence of financing or directing anything specific to this attack?
[00:23:37.716 --> 00:23:39.777]  Not just generally, but specifically?
[00:23:40.642 --> 00:23:44.026]  So maybe I need to clarify further from what Lita had mentioned.
[00:23:44.246 --> 00:23:47.930]  We know that Iran funds these groups, like Qatab Hezbollah.
[00:23:48.371 --> 00:23:54.317]  We know that these IRGC-backed militias are the ones responsible for attacks on our troops in Iraq and Syria.
[00:23:54.958 --> 00:23:57.761]  Beyond that, we're doing an intelligence assessment.
[00:23:57.821 --> 00:24:00.064]  We don't have – I can't give you today that –
[00:24:02.032 --> 00:24:09.914]  We just know that Iran funds these groups like Qatab Hezbollah and other groups that have attacked our forces, but I don't have more to share on that.
[00:24:10.154 --> 00:24:11.074]  As a general matter, yes.
[00:24:12.494 --> 00:24:18.455]  Now let's go to Joy Reid, who says that if a white person has cornrows, that they're appropriating black culture.
[00:24:18.475 --> 00:24:21.176]  By the way, white people have always braided their hair.
[00:24:21.216 --> 00:24:24.536]  It doesn't matter if you want to appropriate black culture or white culture.
[00:24:24.576 --> 00:24:25.276]  It's all pure crap.
[00:24:25.736 --> 00:24:29.077]  But here she is with her blonde-haired devil hair.
[00:24:33.195 --> 00:24:40.981]  Over the weekend, President Biden said he's ready to take action if Congress is serious about solving the border issue.
[00:24:42.983 --> 00:24:43.223]  Oh, yeah.
[00:24:55.219 --> 00:24:57.340]  So imagine what she really says behind the scenes.
[00:24:57.701 --> 00:25:00.543]  These people know they are frauds, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:00.923 --> 00:25:01.703]  They're mercenaries.
[00:25:01.723 --> 00:25:09.729]  Speaking of mercenaries, here's the White House press secretary clown saying that the troops died for the Biden administration.
[00:25:11.144 --> 00:25:34.986]  What I will say, our deepest, obviously our deepest condolences go out, and our heartfelt condolences go out to the families who lost three brave, three folks who are military folks, who are brave, who are always fighting, who are fighting on behalf of this administration, of the American people, obviously more so, more importantly.
[00:25:35.567 --> 00:25:36.588]  We lost those souls.
[00:25:37.734 --> 00:25:39.836]  I ran engaged in a couple of attacks under Trump.
[00:26:06.863 --> 00:26:14.666]  And Trump said no to the Republican Democratic establishment wanting a full bombardment of Tehran that would have led to a wider war.
[00:26:15.307 --> 00:26:19.568]  Instead, Trump said, we're going to kill Soleimani.
[00:26:21.689 --> 00:26:23.250]  And they killed the leader of their military.
[00:26:25.103 --> 00:26:25.784]  I think we're good to go.
[00:26:25.804 --> 00:26:26.444]  I think we're good to go.
[00:26:55.715 --> 00:26:56.937]  I don't want to kill their leadership.
[00:26:57.878 --> 00:27:12.973]  I'm just saying, if they fund and run Hamas attacks on Israel, Israel would have had the high ground, and I would have supported them going after the leadership of Hamas and the Quds Force's leaders.
[00:27:13.834 --> 00:27:15.556]  That's the Iranian militia.
[00:27:16.297 --> 00:27:16.978]  But instead...
[00:27:18.274 --> 00:27:18.454]  I think?
[00:27:41.263 --> 00:27:41.803]  And then we're all dead.
[00:28:09.545 --> 00:28:12.146]  Unless you're living in some South Pacific island.
[00:28:12.466 --> 00:28:15.927]  And again, even if you're in some bunker in Wyoming, folks, there's a full nuclear war.
[00:28:17.368 --> 00:28:20.229]  The scenarios make Road Warrior look like a walk in the park.
[00:28:20.829 --> 00:28:33.613]  Because there'll be tens of millions of dead, hundreds of millions with energy off, break down the food chain, and then people are just going to come dig you out of your bunkers, ladies and gentlemen, and eat your ass.
[00:28:34.929 --> 00:28:36.390]  I mean, I've looked at the scenarios.
[00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:37.772]  I should do a whole breakdown.
[00:28:38.052 --> 00:28:39.954]  Have you seen Viggo Mortensen in the road?
[00:28:40.434 --> 00:28:41.575]  That's what you're talking about.
[00:28:41.595 --> 00:28:43.217]  Okay?
[00:28:43.357 --> 00:28:45.559]  A year after a nuclear war, that's what you're looking at.
[00:28:46.419 --> 00:28:48.121]  You're looking at cannibalism within two weeks.
[00:28:48.842 --> 00:28:50.483]  All right, folks.
[00:28:50.503 --> 00:28:51.984]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:52.004 --> 00:28:52.425]  Stay with us.
[00:28:52.445 --> 00:28:54.407]  We've got Vivek joining us.
[00:28:59.727 --> 00:29:01.969]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.490]  Thank you.
[00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:05.232]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[00:29:05.312 --> 00:29:06.574]  I started taking that stuff.
[00:29:06.614 --> 00:29:09.817]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[00:29:09.917 --> 00:29:10.838]  When did you start taking it?
[00:29:11.098 --> 00:29:15.022]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[00:29:15.662 --> 00:29:15.803]  Mm-hmm.
[00:29:15.823 --> 00:29:15.943]  Mm-hmm.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:32.901]  I think we're good to go.
[00:29:59.838 --> 00:30:01.178]  We're good to go.
[00:30:01.198 --> 00:30:02.599]  We're good to go.
[00:30:02.619 --> 00:30:03.619]  We're good to go.
[00:30:22.483 --> 00:30:23.224]  I think we're good to go.

[00:33:11.397 --> 00:33:14.206]  The front lines of the information war.
[00:33:14.748 --> 00:33:16.112]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:27.935 --> 00:33:31.617]  Vivek Ramaswamy is our guest, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:31.657 --> 00:33:33.938]  And boy, he was popular running for president.
[00:33:33.958 --> 00:33:35.218]  He's even more popular now.
[00:33:35.698 --> 00:33:36.899]  I've talked to a lot of insiders.
[00:33:36.919 --> 00:33:41.621]  They say Trump is strongly considering him for the vice president, which is a really smart move on so many fronts.
[00:33:41.681 --> 00:33:43.962]  We'll briefly speak about that coming up.
[00:33:43.982 --> 00:33:49.164]  But I was just asking Vivek during the break when he was dialing into us.
[00:33:49.764 --> 00:33:50.224]  We're good to go.
[00:34:15.291 --> 00:34:20.820]  And congratulations just on X a day, because I follow you religiously, and so does Elon.
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:23.604]  You're reaching like 30, 40 million people a day.
[00:34:24.245 --> 00:34:26.488]  This is just explosive, so congratulations.
[00:34:27.605 --> 00:34:28.145]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:34:28.265 --> 00:34:35.731]  We're just getting warmed up, and as I told you at the start of the campaign when we got started in this, at least the first time we spoke, I'm all in for the country.
[00:34:35.971 --> 00:34:37.092]  And you know what?
[00:34:37.192 --> 00:34:41.515]  The people of this country made loud and clear who they want to lead the America First movement to the next level.
[00:34:42.035 --> 00:34:47.379]  The next four years, that's going to be Donald Trump, and he has my full support, and I'm going to do everything I can in my power.
[00:34:47.399 --> 00:34:48.840]  I mean that, Alex, to the fullest.
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:50.762]  To make sure he's the next president.
[00:34:50.982 --> 00:34:57.010]  But also, in the meantime, use my talents and my energy to make sure that we are saving this country in every way.
[00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:59.634]  Not just within the government, but outside the government as well.
[00:35:00.117 --> 00:35:00.497]  We're good to go.
[00:35:00.537 --> 00:35:01.018]  We're good to go.
[00:35:23.936 --> 00:35:28.780]  Look, I think that there's a basic principle that our government is not following right now.
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:33.763]  The people who we elect to run the government should be the ones who actually run the government.
[00:35:33.823 --> 00:35:35.024]  That's not the case right now, Alex.
[00:35:35.044 --> 00:35:36.165]  You know that as well as I do.
[00:35:36.806 --> 00:35:43.251]  And so part of what the Donald Trump re-election looks like is that's once again not just electing the policies that you and I favor.
[00:35:43.971 --> 00:35:49.234]  It's re-electing a way of life in America where the people who we elect are actually the ones who run the show.
[00:35:49.254 --> 00:35:57.498]  One of the things I said in my campaign was that I would fire 75% of federal bureaucrats, shut down government agencies, actually decimate that deep state.
[00:35:57.978 --> 00:36:04.442]  And I think that's what Donald Trump right now, the people who are left in this race, obviously Donald Trump is going to be the person to get that done.
[00:36:04.482 --> 00:36:06.223]  And I will help him in every way that I can.
[00:36:06.843 --> 00:36:07.683]  We're good to go.
[00:36:07.703 --> 00:36:07.884]  I think?
[00:36:32.995 --> 00:36:42.407]  And so one of the things I'm focused on, even the mainstream media, Alex, and so one of the things I'm focused on even this year, and it's going to be still one year before Donald Trump takes over as the next president of the United States.
[00:36:42.467 --> 00:36:43.749]  We're going to make sure that that happens.
[00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:49.576]  In that year, how much change can we drive in the other institutions outside of government as well
[00:36:50.077 --> 00:36:53.240]  Because that's going to be part of how we revive and save this country as well.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:37:03.570]  And so that's part of what I'm focused on is continuing to defeat the ESG cartel in the private sector, continuing to defeat the managerial class in our nation's top and elite universities.
[00:37:04.031 --> 00:37:07.474]  And I'm focused on that in every aspect of our lives, not just government.
[00:37:07.895 --> 00:37:11.919]  But yes, I will be helping Donald Trump in whatever way I can to do that in the federal government as well.
[00:37:13.527 --> 00:37:30.569]  Vivek, pulling back here, because you really are a great analyst down at the one-foot view and the thousand-foot view and the 35,000-foot view and the 100-mile-up view, how would you describe where the country, where the world is right now, and how important each and every person is to be active and vocal and...
[00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:35.473]  Really, who we should see ourselves as, because you mentioned the managerial bureaucrats.
[00:37:35.933 --> 00:37:45.820]  Klaus Schwab and the UN write about how they've penetrated the cabinets, how they control half the governments of the world, how they're this global uniparty, so people see it as their governments, but no, it's really this group.
[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:48.982]  And with you and Trump and myself and Tucker Carlson and others,
[00:37:49.810 --> 00:38:01.248]  We're really spotlighting that it's populist, nationalist, free market people and traditionalists versus these globalists that are coming after anything basic and good and wholesome because it stands in the way of their monopoly of power.
[00:38:01.568 --> 00:38:04.433]  And I think you are the best, other than Trump, at illustrating that.
[00:38:05.492 --> 00:38:09.774]  So look, I think that we're part of what I would call a libertarian nationalist movement, actually.
[00:38:09.794 --> 00:38:11.334]  It's not just libertarians, it's not just nationalists.
[00:38:11.674 --> 00:38:18.657]  It's freedom-loving nationalist movement to say that we're citizens of this nation, not some nebulous global citizen, and we're going to be proud of that.
[00:38:19.137 --> 00:38:20.877]  We live in a 1776 moment.
[00:38:20.897 --> 00:38:22.798]  You ask me, what do I see right now globally?
[00:38:23.298 --> 00:38:24.439]  I think 2024 is a 1776 kind of year, Alex.
[00:38:24.499 --> 00:38:24.979]  That's what I believe.
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.262]  And I think that that's a special time to be alive.
[00:38:30.282 --> 00:38:32.624]  I mean, if you think about it, what is our responsibility?
[00:38:32.644 --> 00:38:34.385]  That's what our founding fathers would tell us.
[00:38:34.405 --> 00:38:39.870]  What would Thomas Jefferson or John Jay or George Washington or Alexander Hamilton, what would those guys tell us?
[00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:42.232]  Benjamin Franklin, if they were alive today.
[00:38:42.812 --> 00:38:48.177]  I think they would tell us, you have another 250 years and then some still left in this American journey.
[00:38:48.657 --> 00:38:54.082]  But you're going to have to do it the way we did in 1776 in stepping up and seizing that for ourselves.
[00:38:54.662 --> 00:39:02.444]  Today, in this moment, that doesn't mean resorting to the revolution like we did in 1776, but doing it through the front door of the ballot box, peacefully.
[00:39:02.804 --> 00:39:06.966]  And I think that this is our moment to revive those 1776 ideals in that spirit.
[00:39:07.546 --> 00:39:11.307]  They had to fight a revolution over King George in England to be able to do it.
[00:39:11.527 --> 00:39:11.847]  We're good to go.
[00:39:11.867 --> 00:39:12.028]  I think?
[00:39:30.891 --> 00:39:50.240]  And I think we live in one of those moments today where Republicans and Democrats alike have rejected that vision to say it's a small group of managerial elites in the back of palace halls in old world England or in the back of three-letter government agency buildings or in the back of BlackRock's corner office today that instead make the right decisions for the rest of society at large.
[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:56.645]  That's an old 1776 question that ugly monster has reared its head again today in the year 2024.
[00:39:57.245 --> 00:40:08.594]  And I think just as it was true in 1776, it's true today that we the people have to stand up for an actual government that is accountable back to us to make sure the people we elect to run the government, the U.S.
[00:40:08.654 --> 00:40:13.778]  president, the congressman, the senators, they're once again the ones who actually wield political power rather than the bureaucrats.
[00:40:13.798 --> 00:40:14.479]  And I totally agree.
[00:40:14.499 --> 00:40:16.641]  When we talked briefly for a minute or two before we went live,
[00:40:17.401 --> 00:40:17.661]  I think?
[00:40:35.796 --> 00:40:36.356]  We're good to go.
[00:40:59.704 --> 00:41:04.967]  So one of the things I've appreciated in my interactions with President Trump is how receptive he is to the right policies.
[00:41:05.448 --> 00:41:07.329]  It's not what the mainstream media portrays of him.
[00:41:07.389 --> 00:41:13.713]  The truth is this is a man who actually wants to get to the bottom of doing what's right for the country, even if it's new information that he didn't have before.
[00:41:13.833 --> 00:41:19.797]  So when I was with him in New Hampshire backstage, Alex, for example, we had a conversation about the perils of a central bank digital currency.
[00:41:20.197 --> 00:41:20.838]  We're good to go.
[00:41:20.878 --> 00:41:21.318]  We're good to go.
[00:41:45.698 --> 00:41:53.845]  I'm honored and excited to be working one way or another with President Trump, and I think it's another reason why we have to have him in the White House to see this through.
[00:41:54.305 --> 00:41:58.969]  But the real threats we face to our liberty today aren't just coming through the front door of big government.
[00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:02.773]  They're coming through a new hybrid of big government and big business.
[00:42:03.513 --> 00:42:31.961]  That together are far more powerful than either one alone, where the government is delegating its political authority to not just three-letter agencies, but those three-letter agencies are then delegating their political power to private actors, like tech companies that censor speech through the back door that the government couldn't censor through the front door, like banks and financial institutions, asset managers like BlackRock that vote for policies fighting climate change, racial injustice that the government couldn't anyway.
[00:42:32.381 --> 00:42:36.963]  So one of the ways we stop that is, first of all, a lot of the money propping this up is coming from the government.
[00:42:37.083 --> 00:42:40.625]  So a lot of what the state attorneys general are doing are steps in the right direction.
[00:42:41.105 --> 00:42:42.686]  One of the ways, Alex, is through competition.
[00:42:43.307 --> 00:42:55.453]  The company that I started before I actually ran for president is called Strive that competes directly against BlackRock and State Street and Vanguard by offering investment products that are the same kinds of investment products
[00:42:56.013 --> 00:42:56.774]  We're good to go.
[00:43:16.676 --> 00:43:19.438]  And that tells you that we the people are hungry for these alternatives.
[00:43:19.518 --> 00:43:19.998]  Exactly.
[00:43:20.098 --> 00:43:21.319]  Elon actually bought Twitter.
[00:43:21.719 --> 00:43:22.280]  The same thing.
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:23.861]  And so it's not just through government.
[00:43:23.881 --> 00:43:25.542]  That's the one message I want to send to people.
[00:43:26.062 --> 00:43:28.984]  It's not just through politicians and government driving change.
[00:43:29.364 --> 00:43:29.944]  That's important.
[00:43:30.185 --> 00:43:36.909]  And I'm going to do everything in my power that Donald Trump is successfully elected so that he's able to lead for the next 40 years from the front in the federal government.
[00:43:37.429 --> 00:43:37.869]  We're good to go.
[00:43:37.889 --> 00:43:38.029]  I think?
[00:44:03.897 --> 00:44:04.438]  We're good to go.
[00:44:04.498 --> 00:44:04.678]  I think?
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:20.601]  I think we're good to go.
[00:44:39.966 --> 00:44:41.928]  Well, I just want to be respectful of President Trump.
[00:44:41.988 --> 00:44:49.754]  That's his decision to make, and I'm all in for making sure that he is successful in leading this country, and most importantly, Alex, in getting elected.
[00:44:50.295 --> 00:45:02.345]  One of the things that I spotted, and you spotted, and Tucker spotted, but I'm going to say it even though it makes some people uncomfortable, is that I think there is absolutely an establishment plot to keep this man away from getting to power again.
[00:45:02.365 --> 00:45:02.425]  And...
[00:45:03.926 --> 00:45:08.949]  Version number one of this, the first path that they're trying is to prop up their chosen puppet, Nikki Haley.
[00:45:09.169 --> 00:45:17.654]  I think part of what they want to do is make this primary go as long as it can so that one way or another they can take Donald Trump out of contention and then prop their puppet, Nikki Haley, in.
[00:45:17.714 --> 00:45:19.875]  One of the things I've learned, and you've learned this too.
[00:45:19.895 --> 00:45:20.796]  By the way, let me stop you.
[00:45:20.816 --> 00:45:21.977]  Let me stop you because you're so right.
[00:45:22.077 --> 00:45:23.998]  You hammered that for months on the show every week.
[00:45:24.018 --> 00:45:24.678]  Gracious to join us.
[00:45:25.479 --> 00:45:29.081]  And then the Washington Post came out last week and said he'll probably get assassinated.
[00:45:29.301 --> 00:45:30.341]  That's why we want her to stay in.
[00:45:30.562 --> 00:45:31.722]  They're even admitting that.
[00:45:31.762 --> 00:45:32.763]  So you called that.
[00:45:33.769 --> 00:45:41.716]  Yeah, and now you're effectively seeing even some of the mainstream establishments almost rooting for his elimination one way or another to prop up Haley.
[00:45:42.056 --> 00:45:45.960]  And it even made many in the Mago and America First movement uncomfortable when I said that, Alex.
[00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:49.423]  But sometimes the truth is hard, and you have to be willing to swallow the hard truth.
[00:45:49.843 --> 00:45:57.610]  But one of the things that I've learned in life is that if you want to stop a problem from transpiring, the first step is to name the problem.
[00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:57.790]  Exactly.
[00:45:57.930 --> 00:45:58.611]  Keep naming it.
[00:45:58.691 --> 00:46:00.232]  Keep saying it unsparingly.
[00:46:00.612 --> 00:46:03.275]  And then it makes them harder for them to actually affect that.
[00:46:03.295 --> 00:46:04.996]  So I got about 8% of the vote in Iowa.
[00:46:05.777 --> 00:46:08.740]  And I had to take a long, hard look in the mirror myself, Alex, and make a decision.
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:10.722]  I was about to get 8% of the vote in New Hampshire.
[00:46:11.302 --> 00:46:13.604]  But for the country, what was the right decision to make?
[00:46:13.664 --> 00:46:15.966]  And I wanted all of that to go in Donald Trump's direction.
[00:46:15.986 --> 00:46:16.347]  Well, that's right.
[00:46:16.367 --> 00:46:18.389]  If you wouldn't have done that, she might have won.
[00:46:18.649 --> 00:46:20.230]  If you wouldn't have done that, she might have won.
[00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:23.053]  The only one by 11 points, she might have won New Hampshire.
[00:46:24.076 --> 00:46:29.159]  Well, look, what I'm going to say is at every step, as I did after Iowa, I'm going to do what I believe is right for this country.
[00:46:29.179 --> 00:46:33.862]  And so I have named that problem, that risk of what the establishment's trying to do, propping up Nikki Haley.
[00:46:34.262 --> 00:46:38.345]  I think in New Hampshire we effectively ended the GOP primary for all intents and purposes.
[00:46:38.765 --> 00:46:40.887]  Now all she needs to do is formally get out of the way.
[00:46:41.707 --> 00:46:42.107]  We're good to go.
[00:46:59.719 --> 00:47:00.659]  Well, they admit there is.
[00:47:00.679 --> 00:47:00.899]  I mean...
[00:47:21.546 --> 00:47:29.009]  And we've got to stay ahead of it, keep naming the problem, and the more we're naming it, the less likely it is they're able to effectuate whatever it is that they have in store.
[00:47:29.069 --> 00:47:37.813]  And so that's why people like you and I and Tucker and others and Trump himself and Elon and others need to be speaking unsparingly about what we see playing out.
[00:47:38.273 --> 00:47:47.777]  You know, what the left likes to call or the mainstream media will call conspiracy theories, I actually just call nothing more than an amalgam of incentives hiding in plain sight.
[00:47:47.837 --> 00:47:48.718]  That's really what it is.
[00:47:49.358 --> 00:47:51.220]  And so keep naming those incentives.
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:52.481]  Keep calling that out.
[00:47:53.061 --> 00:47:56.084]  And I think that allows us to make sure the right thing actually happens.
[00:47:56.184 --> 00:48:01.448]  And whatever role it is, I appreciate your kind words, but whatever role it is, I'm all in to help the country.
[00:48:01.508 --> 00:48:06.613]  And whether that's inside the government or outside the government, there's a role for every one of us to play.
[00:48:07.253 --> 00:48:09.114]  To reclaim who we really are as Americans.
[00:48:09.254 --> 00:48:09.614]  Absolutely.
[00:48:09.634 --> 00:48:10.975]  We've got about six, seven minutes left.
[00:48:11.055 --> 00:48:12.536]  I really, again, appreciate your time.
[00:48:13.716 --> 00:48:15.737]  Let me throw a smorgasbord of quick questions at you.
[00:48:16.398 --> 00:48:20.700]  You talk about Congress is funding so many of these NGOs and these global scripts.
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:21.400]  That's totally true.
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:27.503]  And I'm glad to see, finally, people are, oh, it's the UN running the invasion camps built in Central and South America.
[00:48:27.683 --> 00:48:30.004]  And that's been on record forever.
[00:48:30.324 --> 00:48:31.745]  That's who ran the invasion of Europe.
[00:48:32.085 --> 00:48:33.286]  And people, you know, Congress...
[00:48:33.846 --> 00:48:35.086]  You're running it executively.
[00:48:35.147 --> 00:48:35.987]  You've said that.
[00:48:36.087 --> 00:48:36.427]  Trump said it.
[00:48:58.991 --> 00:49:01.012]  But I think Trump could do a little better job.
[00:49:01.032 --> 00:49:07.533]  I know he's got a lot going on to point out, because they're just spinning it, as you know, that Trump is refusing a deal to fix it.
[00:49:07.573 --> 00:49:10.394]  No, the deal Biden has floated is an amnesty.
[00:49:10.434 --> 00:49:11.535]  So can you speak to that?
[00:49:11.875 --> 00:49:12.215]  Thank you.
[00:49:12.495 --> 00:49:14.916]  Alex, you actually hit the nail on the head right there.
[00:49:15.456 --> 00:49:19.417]  This idea of a legislative deal to fix the border is a farce.
[00:49:20.197 --> 00:49:25.461]  And the reason why is we already have the laws on the books to address the border crisis.
[00:49:25.982 --> 00:49:29.745]  What we're missing is an executive who's actually enforcing those laws.
[00:49:30.305 --> 00:49:31.826]  So many people don't know this, Alex.
[00:49:32.447 --> 00:49:37.571]  Remain in Mexico, that policy, is still the law of the land in the United States of America.
[00:49:38.051 --> 00:49:38.932]  That hasn't changed.
[00:49:39.372 --> 00:49:44.894]  It's just that Mayorkas and the deep state within the Department of Homeland Security is refusing to enforce it.
[00:49:44.994 --> 00:49:45.795]  That's the reality.
[00:49:46.255 --> 00:50:02.762]  287G, it's another section of the law that effectively allows the Department of Homeland Security and allows for ICE to delegate their warrant service power to local law enforcement, which would allow us to actually round up and deport anybody who's in this country illegally.
[00:50:03.222 --> 00:50:05.183]  That's already the law in this country.
[00:50:05.723 --> 00:50:24.106]  So the idea that we need new laws passed is actually a farce designed to just blame certain people like Trump or others, artificially blame them, when in fact the reality is all you need is a president who understands the law deeply, but who also has the conviction and the spine to enforce that law unsparingly.
[00:50:24.126 --> 00:50:25.246]  So that's why I ran for president.
[00:50:25.406 --> 00:50:34.688]  I think it's going to take somebody who is willing to break things in Washington, D.C., but is also deeply conversant and understanding of the law and the Constitution to use that power.
[00:50:35.168 --> 00:50:35.548]  Well, you know what?
[00:50:35.568 --> 00:50:40.009]  I'm going to now do everything in my power to make sure Donald Trump is successful in that role and has that understanding.
[00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:48.492]  But this idea of, oh, there's a border deal that the Republicans or Trump or the America First wing is stonewalling, it's artificial, it's fake, it's wrong.
[00:50:48.932 --> 00:50:51.633]  Because actually, the laws on the books are already plenty sufficient.
[00:50:52.053 --> 00:50:54.814]  All we need is a chief executive who actually has the spine to enforce it.
[00:50:55.034 --> 00:50:55.514]  Absolutely.
[00:50:55.534 --> 00:50:56.554]  We're almost out of time.
[00:50:56.674 --> 00:50:57.614]  We're going to make sure we do.
[00:50:57.794 --> 00:50:58.255]  Beautiful.
[00:50:58.475 --> 00:50:59.415]  Everybody can follow you.
[00:50:59.455 --> 00:51:02.356]  We'll put your ex-account right up there so everybody can get on that and follow that.
[00:51:03.615 --> 00:51:04.916]  Where do you think this is going?
[00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:16.291]  So, yeah, I mean, a few things.
[00:51:16.311 --> 00:51:21.794]  There's three of America's sons that were killed, and that's a travesty, and my heart goes out to them and their families.
[00:51:22.275 --> 00:51:29.179]  And one of the lessons we have to learn is to say that if we're really standing by our troops, if the people who are standing for us, we have to stand behind them.
[00:51:29.219 --> 00:51:33.863]  And the way we stand behind them is make sure that our troops are only ever deployed.
[00:51:34.463 --> 00:51:38.146]  In a situation where they're actually advancing American interests.
[00:51:38.166 --> 00:51:42.790]  And they're sticking them out there like a bunch of bait on a mousetrap.
[00:51:42.810 --> 00:51:45.553]  They're just little bases all surrounded by enemies.
[00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:47.951]  And you know what?
[00:51:48.171 --> 00:51:59.438]  The irony is we now live in the worst of all worlds where many of our sons and daughters are sitting as sitting ducks when, in fact, we actually could use our own military to protect our own borders in this country, which is something that we're failing to do.
[00:51:59.498 --> 00:52:02.640]  The border discussion we had versus this, they're not unrelated, Alex.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:04.301]  They're two sides of the same coin.
[00:52:04.781 --> 00:52:05.041]  Thank you.
[00:52:05.081 --> 00:52:05.302]  Thank you.
[00:52:23.965 --> 00:52:26.809]  And I think they're just looking for an excuse to actually do it.
[00:52:26.829 --> 00:52:29.472]  I think this could be a disaster, actually, for the United States.
[00:52:29.512 --> 00:52:34.999]  We cannot fall into this trap of a preemptive strike at a moment where that doesn't advance our interests.
[00:52:35.019 --> 00:52:38.062]  We have to stand for our own troops and our own national interests.
[00:52:38.523 --> 00:52:42.027]  But that's a separate question from whether we want a preemptive strike on Iran.
[00:52:42.668 --> 00:52:44.610]  Anybody heard of a super EMP attack?
[00:52:44.650 --> 00:52:45.791]  If you haven't, you should look it up.
[00:52:45.831 --> 00:52:47.252]  An electromagnetic pulse attack.
[00:52:47.392 --> 00:52:49.835]  Iran, other countries have a capability.
[00:52:50.315 --> 00:52:57.282]  Do we actually want to be in a situation where other adversaries who have the power to take out our electric grid in a matter of days could be in a position to actually do so?
[00:52:57.502 --> 00:52:58.983]  No, that's not the place we want to go.
[00:52:59.524 --> 00:53:00.344]  And so here's my view.
[00:53:00.364 --> 00:53:08.192]  The people who we elect to run our government, they owe a moral duty to the citizens of this nation, the United States of America, not any other one.
[00:53:08.692 --> 00:53:09.172]  And you know what?
[00:53:09.313 --> 00:53:12.075]  I do stand for Israel's right to national self-defense.
[00:53:12.135 --> 00:53:13.155]  I stand fully for that.
[00:53:13.516 --> 00:53:15.057]  What Hamas did to Israel was wrong.
[00:53:15.137 --> 00:53:15.957]  It was subhuman.
[00:53:16.017 --> 00:53:16.698]  It was medieval.
[00:53:16.758 --> 00:53:17.479]  It was immoral.
[00:53:17.859 --> 00:53:20.461]  And Israel has the right to defend itself.
[00:53:21.101 --> 00:53:22.943]  And so if I was on the phone with Bibi, I would tell him, you know what?
[00:53:22.983 --> 00:53:28.427]  You should smoke the terrorists on your own southern border, and we're going to smoke the terrorists on our own southern border if that's what's required.
[00:53:28.447 --> 00:53:30.428]  Move our own military to our own southern border.
[00:53:30.888 --> 00:53:31.869]  Protect this nation.
[00:53:32.330 --> 00:53:36.613]  And the ultimate irony of this, Alex, is that we're actually failing to do that here at home.
[00:53:37.173 --> 00:53:39.934]  Well, we're increasing the risk of major conflict abroad.
[00:53:40.014 --> 00:53:40.535]  Absolutely.
[00:53:40.555 --> 00:53:41.855]  When, in fact, it could be the reverse of that.
[00:53:41.875 --> 00:53:43.896]  Final question, now you've got to go.
[00:53:43.916 --> 00:53:53.701]  George Soros, and even in Europe, they admit George Soros' son is financing movements to shut down the farmers protesting being shut down by the ESGs and the carbon taxes.
[00:53:54.161 --> 00:53:55.382]  They're trying the same thing here.
[00:53:55.922 --> 00:53:56.462]  We're good to go.
[00:54:22.554 --> 00:54:23.094]  We're good to go.
[00:54:23.114 --> 00:54:23.255]  I think?
[00:54:45.413 --> 00:54:50.198]  Are these transnational institutions that are hostile to our own sovereignty in the United States?
[00:54:50.699 --> 00:55:02.591]  And so one of the things that I'll be talking to President Trump about shortly, I think these are topics he is interested in, is we need to stop using our own taxpayer money to fund institutions that are hostile to the sovereignty of the United States.
[00:55:02.771 --> 00:55:13.039]  Whether that's the World Economic Forum or the UN or the WHO or three-letter institutions here in the United States, stop using our money to fund institutions hostile to our own sovereignty.
[00:55:13.499 --> 00:55:16.221]  That'll go a long way to actually getting our country back.
[00:55:16.281 --> 00:55:21.425]  And Steve King is a guy who actually has looked at a lot of this at the ground level who I think could actually be a great person to talk to.
[00:55:21.425 --> 00:55:21.745]  He was on.
[00:55:21.765 --> 00:55:22.786]  We're going to get him on again.
[00:55:22.826 --> 00:55:23.226]  Great guy.
[00:55:23.246 --> 00:55:23.966]  You're absolutely right.
[00:55:24.606 --> 00:55:28.048]  No one's talking about this but you, Trump, Steve King, a few others, Lou Dobbs.
[00:55:28.348 --> 00:55:32.090]  That is the head of the snake, and that's because they don't want it discussed because it's so easy.
[00:55:32.290 --> 00:55:33.371]  Look at El Salvador.
[00:55:33.411 --> 00:55:36.052]  Two years, most dangerous country in the world, now one of the safest.
[00:55:36.232 --> 00:55:38.813]  With good leadership, we have what we need to turn it around.
[00:55:39.173 --> 00:55:41.314]  Vivek Ramaswamy, thank you so much, sir.
[00:55:41.334 --> 00:55:42.095]  We'll talk to you soon.
[00:55:42.135 --> 00:55:42.535]  Godspeed.
[00:55:43.561 --> 00:55:43.841]  Thank you.
[00:55:44.482 --> 00:55:46.123]  Well, that was powerful as usual.
[00:55:46.223 --> 00:55:48.125]  Man, they are scared of that guy.
[00:55:48.586 --> 00:55:51.108]  And we were very, very honored and blessed to have him on with us.
[00:55:51.588 --> 00:55:52.830]  Okay, here's what's going to happen.
[00:55:54.131 --> 00:55:55.132]  I want to take your calls.
[00:55:55.612 --> 00:55:58.395]  I got a lot of news, a lot of clips, a lot of craziness.
[00:55:59.456 --> 00:56:07.963]  But I want to open the phones up for first-time callers, long-time callers, never called, agree, disagree.
[00:56:09.261 --> 00:56:15.483]  We do not screen your calls except have a clean phone line, and we'd like you to tell us where you're calling from.
[00:56:15.503 --> 00:56:16.503]  You can tell us how you're listening.
[00:56:16.523 --> 00:56:17.383]  You don't even have to do that.
[00:56:18.003 --> 00:56:20.424]  You can say you're calling from the moon or say anonymous.
[00:56:20.684 --> 00:56:21.204]  I don't care.
[00:56:21.664 --> 00:56:24.865]  Just have a clean phone line.
[00:56:25.785 --> 00:56:27.826]  I'll give the toll-free number out when we start the next hour.
[00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:34.721]  So much news on the border I want to hit first, and Soros and all of it, and some big new COVID news.
[00:56:34.761 --> 00:56:38.162]  Before I go any further, though, very exciting.
[00:56:38.982 --> 00:56:48.725]  We've taken the nitric boost formula that you've seen great folks, like Dr. Judy Minkovich say, is one of the best she's seen at cleaning out the blood.
[00:56:49.745 --> 00:56:51.166]  We're good to go.
[00:56:51.246 --> 00:56:51.586]  I think?
[00:57:16.195 --> 00:57:24.702]  The new and improved Nitric Boost, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and it is discounted out of the gates.
[00:57:25.162 --> 00:57:26.423]  What is that, 40% off?
[00:57:26.483 --> 00:57:26.784]  Wow.
[00:57:27.364 --> 00:57:29.766]  Nitric Boost, 40% off, already a bestseller.
[00:57:29.786 --> 00:57:33.409]  40% off Nitric Boost, InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:33.469 --> 00:57:39.254]  And selling out quickly, the first run of next-level foundational energy with the methylfolate and more.
[00:57:39.694 --> 00:57:41.595]  You need to get next level foundational energy?
[00:57:41.615 --> 00:57:45.856]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:46.416 --> 00:57:46.936]  Stay with us.
[00:57:50.397 --> 00:57:54.639]  The second American revolution is happening now right in front of you.
[00:57:54.959 --> 00:57:59.300]  And you're tuned in Infowars because you're either looking for the truth or you're already a patriot.
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:07.623]  I'm asking you now to realize we are at the fulcrum, the crossroads in the fight for human destiny and human future.
[00:58:08.363 --> 00:58:09.143]  We're good to go.
[00:58:27.068 --> 00:58:28.288]  In our victory against these tyrants.
[00:58:28.568 --> 00:58:30.149]  But now is the time to make the decision.
[00:58:30.709 --> 00:58:35.491]  I know there's millions of forms of media out there and all this BS, and the globalists hope you get lost in all of it.
[00:58:35.851 --> 00:58:40.492]  But notice the globalists, the New World Order, are coming after us because they realize we've got their number.
[00:58:41.393 --> 00:58:41.853]  Think about it.
[00:58:42.213 --> 00:58:43.513]  InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:58:43.533 --> 00:58:46.994]  If you want to support the tip of the spear, that decision is up to you.
[00:58:47.294 --> 00:58:48.835]  Please support us now at InfoWars.com.
[00:58:51.178 --> 00:58:54.299]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:58:54.319 --> 00:58:55.839]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:58:56.599 --> 00:58:59.660]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:08.622]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:59:09.482 --> 00:59:17.264]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:59:18.283 --> 00:59:21.184]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:59:21.944 --> 00:59:26.926]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:59:27.727 --> 00:59:28.627]  I know you spread the word.
[00:59:28.667 --> 00:59:30.148]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[00:59:30.188 --> 00:59:30.708]  Keep doing it.
[00:59:30.748 --> 00:59:37.370]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[00:59:37.810 --> 00:59:38.991]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[00:59:39.711 --> 00:59:43.335]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:43.996 --> 00:59:48.621]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsTore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:59:48.941 --> 00:59:49.782]  Please take action now.
[00:59:51.404 --> 00:59:57.291]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:11.192 --> 01:00:13.114]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[01:00:13.194 --> 01:00:14.115]  We join a lot of states.
[01:00:14.135 --> 01:00:15.496]  It's coming up at the start of the next segment.
[01:00:15.516 --> 01:00:21.722]  I'm going to give the toll-free number out to cover the border, the Iran crisis, the globalists.
[01:00:22.903 --> 01:00:25.866]  There is so much we're going to be getting to.
[01:00:25.966 --> 01:00:28.989]  Why are European governments urging citizens to stockpile prescription drugs?
[01:00:29.029 --> 01:00:30.990]  They say ahead of massive war.
[01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:36.756]  They're trying to hire all these illegal aliens to basically make up the new military and police systems.
[01:00:38.186 --> 01:00:39.026]  I think we're good to go.
[01:00:57.404 --> 01:00:58.145]  Oh, hello!
[01:00:58.545 --> 01:01:03.589]  Sent another communist Chinese dragon here with an important public service announcement.
[01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:17.481]  Live in your poop and needles and human sex trafficking and open borders and buy slave goods from China and do what the Justice Department say and put all the good Americans in prison and stay asleep.
[01:01:18.021 --> 01:01:23.686]  Your master Xi Jinping has arrived and our puppet Biden bowed down to him.
[01:01:24.366 --> 01:01:30.528]  Governor Newsom has also visited and bowed down to our leader, who is also your master.
[01:01:31.008 --> 01:01:38.310]  The shithole city of San Francisco, like all the other communist cities we control, has been flooded with fentanyl.
[01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:42.911]  But when the dear leader arrives, they clean the streets for him.
[01:01:44.677 --> 01:01:49.379]  I know folks say, oh, they're just cleaning up this place because all those fancy leaders are coming into town.
[01:01:49.619 --> 01:01:49.939]  That's true.
[01:02:11.519 --> 01:02:12.340]  Because it's true.
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.201]  That's how we rub the poop in.
[01:02:15.581 --> 01:02:18.683]  Enjoy your shithole cities.
[01:02:18.944 --> 01:02:20.344]  You are done.
[01:02:22.606 --> 01:02:24.567]  We own Hollywood.
[01:02:25.067 --> 01:02:26.708]  We own TikTok.
[01:02:27.128 --> 01:02:29.330]  We own almost everything.
[01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:31.191]  Now we buy up your farmland.
[01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:34.982]  You eat the pies while we eat the steak.
[01:02:35.862 --> 01:02:39.884]  The last group to take out is any leadership that is resisting us.
[01:02:40.205 --> 01:02:42.666]  Like Donald Trump, he will soon be in prison.
[01:02:43.166 --> 01:02:47.709]  And then, of course, we must silence any populace that resists us.
[01:02:48.089 --> 01:02:49.911]  And that is our next move.
[01:02:51.131 --> 01:03:08.075]  Good FBI, good Justice Department, good Merrick Garland, good Jack Smith, put Trump in jail, put political dissidents in jail, silence free speech, censor everyone.
[01:03:08.375 --> 01:03:12.396]  Also, we're very focused on the data we're collecting from surveillance efforts.
[01:03:12.756 --> 01:03:15.337]  What's being said on social media platforms.
[01:03:15.937 --> 01:03:19.838]  Every person on social media should be verified by their name.
[01:03:20.638 --> 01:03:32.652]  We have launched an effort to be able to counter some of the negativity and reach out to people when we see hate speech being spoken about on online platforms.
[01:03:33.233 --> 01:03:37.137]  They need to verify every single person on their...
[01:03:39.779 --> 01:03:41.720]  My slaves.
[01:03:42.481 --> 01:03:43.722]  Repeat after me.
[01:03:43.742 --> 01:03:46.644]  I am going to stay asleep.
[01:03:47.484 --> 01:03:49.165]  I am going to do nothing.
[01:03:49.786 --> 01:03:54.529]  I am going to be politically correct and have your son's genitals removed.
[01:03:55.129 --> 01:04:05.216]  Also, do not support independent media like InfoWars.com and do not get The Great Awakening, the book at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:04:05.596 --> 01:04:06.637]  Stay asleep.
[01:04:06.737 --> 01:04:07.738]  Do not get booked.
[01:04:08.098 --> 01:04:09.039]  No, no, no.
[01:04:09.739 --> 01:04:12.641]  I am giving you your order, slave Americans.
[01:04:13.221 --> 01:04:21.527]  Do not go to Infowarsstore.com and do not get the best-selling book, The Great Awakening, by the evil thought criminal Alex Jones.
[01:04:21.947 --> 01:04:24.669]  And whatever you do, do not get a fundraiser.
[01:04:25.169 --> 01:04:26.110]  Signed copy.
[01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:28.511]  That might keep them on the air.
[01:04:28.972 --> 01:04:38.238]  It will demoralize people greatly once we have shut down Alex Jones and we're working with many people at the Justice Department to do it.
[01:04:38.418 --> 01:04:44.301]  Because if there is great awakening, then we cannot fully enslave and destroy you.
[01:04:45.322 --> 01:04:47.323]  Bing, bing, bong, bong, bing, bing, bing.
[01:04:47.423 --> 01:04:51.305]  This is Oda from CCP and CCP.
[01:04:51.685 --> 01:04:53.966]  Do not visit Infowarshow.com.
[01:04:54.047 --> 01:04:56.308]  Do not, do not, do not.
[01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:04.852]  You know, I sit up here and I yell and scream about the New World Order and the globalists.
[01:05:04.872 --> 01:05:08.994]  They're planning to get rid of the borders and release a virus and have a global power grab.
[01:05:09.014 --> 01:05:10.055]  And you saw it all come true.
[01:05:11.175 --> 01:05:11.936]  But there's a...
[01:05:13.064 --> 01:05:13.845]  Inverse of that.
[01:05:14.585 --> 01:05:17.267]  There's not just the bad stuff I'm telling you about.
[01:05:17.287 --> 01:05:19.568]  There's the good stuff I'm telling you about.
[01:05:20.328 --> 01:05:24.971]  And just like our information is the best you're going to find out there, our supplements are amazing.
[01:05:25.612 --> 01:05:29.374]  So our new special in the last half of January 2024 is here.
[01:05:29.874 --> 01:05:34.237]  It's Real Red Pill Plus and DNA Force Plus, both 50% off.
[01:05:34.397 --> 01:05:37.479]  We're calling it the Supercharged Special.
[01:05:38.139 --> 01:05:43.403]  You can get either one of these great items at 40% off individually or together for 50% off.
[01:05:43.704 --> 01:05:48.167]  Now, in the time we have left, I can't tell you why they're so great and what they do for your body.
[01:05:48.587 --> 01:05:53.311]  Go to InfoWarsHore.com, look at the ingredients and investigate it, and then get them.
[01:05:53.611 --> 01:05:56.113]  It supports the InfoWar and it'll change your life.
[01:05:56.693 --> 01:05:57.474]  Take advantage now.
[01:05:57.654 --> 01:05:58.395]  InfoWarsHore.com.
[01:06:03.237 --> 01:06:12.820]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:16.702 --> 01:06:32.587]  Coming to you live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, I am the quarterback...
[01:06:34.508 --> 01:06:35.650]  Fighting for team humanity.
[01:06:37.672 --> 01:06:38.293]  All right.
[01:06:38.613 --> 01:06:41.898]  Let me tell you all the other news we're going to be getting to and also breaking news, obviously.
[01:06:41.918 --> 01:06:43.239]  And our reporters are now down at the border.
[01:06:43.259 --> 01:06:45.723]  We're going to have some of that, obviously, as it breaks, coming up.
[01:06:46.343 --> 01:06:49.988]  Documenting whether or not Abbott's really doing something or whether it's all smoke and mirrors.
[01:06:50.008 --> 01:06:51.049]  We're going to get to the bottom of it.
[01:06:51.069 --> 01:06:52.611]  You'll hear in the next few days.
[01:06:54.414 --> 01:06:57.276]  But I'm going to give the number out on any topic you want to call in about.
[01:06:57.296 --> 01:07:05.242]  But I would really like to see some military veterans or State Department type people to call in and give me your view of this Iran situation.
[01:07:05.282 --> 01:07:06.323]  Because the word is...
[01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:07.990]  We're good to go.
[01:07:32.728 --> 01:07:35.712]  Meanwhile, our southern border is completely wide open.
[01:07:35.732 --> 01:07:37.735]  So I'd like to hear from you on that topic.
[01:07:39.798 --> 01:07:47.169]  Also, I'd like to get your take on... I've got a bunch of clips on the crazy lady.
[01:07:49.164 --> 01:07:52.785]  They couldn't even say what year Trump supposedly assaulted her, so he couldn't have an alibi.
[01:07:53.565 --> 01:07:55.145]  And no evidence 25 years later.
[01:07:55.165 --> 01:08:00.166]  And then he says, I'm innocent, so there's no criminal charges because they couldn't get criminal charges.
[01:08:00.186 --> 01:08:00.786]  There's no evidence.
[01:08:00.806 --> 01:08:05.207]  So he's found guilty of defamation by Kangaroo Court where the judge says he's guilty.
[01:08:05.227 --> 01:08:06.147]  He says he's innocent.
[01:08:06.607 --> 01:08:08.287]  She sues again and gets $83 million.
[01:08:08.587 --> 01:08:14.268]  And now she's on TV bragging, saying, we're going to buy penthouses and go shopping.
[01:08:14.328 --> 01:08:15.248]  It's so much fun.
[01:08:15.308 --> 01:08:18.309]  I mean, she is just a famous loon.
[01:08:19.835 --> 01:08:24.459]  And it's so dangerous that they weaponize these blue jurisdictions to this point.
[01:08:24.559 --> 01:08:43.734]  I've experienced it myself, where a judge finds you guilty, the news doesn't pick up on that, they have a show trial, and they tell the jury this person's guilty, and then they put on fake evidence and don't let you put on evidence, or they're going to sanction or disbar your lawyers, and they're trying to disbar my lawyer in Connecticut, they're trying to disbar the lawyer in Texas, and they find them both massive amounts of money.
[01:08:43.774 --> 01:08:45.835]  People say, why don't their lawyers talk?
[01:08:46.356 --> 01:08:48.798]  They did talk a little and got sanctioned.
[01:08:49.909 --> 01:08:51.450]  And I would try to explain even family.
[01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:54.190]  You know, cousins and people.
[01:08:54.251 --> 01:08:55.131]  Business people and smart.
[01:08:55.151 --> 01:08:56.791]  And I'm like, you understand, they found me guilty.
[01:08:56.811 --> 01:08:58.172]  Well, they don't do that in America.
[01:08:58.232 --> 01:08:59.392]  Judges don't find you guilty.
[01:08:59.432 --> 01:09:03.194]  Well, now they're all calling me and people on the street are like, whoa, it's crazy what they did to you.
[01:09:03.234 --> 01:09:03.534]  Yeah.
[01:09:06.335 --> 01:09:06.795]  Wait a minute.
[01:09:08.049 --> 01:09:12.512]  You're not allowed to say you're innocent and they're allowed to lie about you and they put on no evidence?
[01:09:12.972 --> 01:09:17.534]  I mean, in his real estate trial, it's a judge, not even a jury.
[01:09:17.935 --> 01:09:19.856]  And he's not even allowed to have closing statements.
[01:09:20.896 --> 01:09:22.297]  We weren't allowed closing statements.
[01:09:22.857 --> 01:09:25.399]  They put a day on in Texas of fake financial stuff.
[01:09:25.759 --> 01:09:28.341]  And I'm sitting there and I walked out of the courtroom.
[01:09:29.101 --> 01:09:30.542]  I said, I'm not going to sit here for this anymore.
[01:09:32.113 --> 01:09:34.454]  The judge says, you are worth $400 million.
[01:09:34.674 --> 01:09:35.635]  And I say, it's not true.
[01:09:35.655 --> 01:09:42.139]  And she goes, Mr. Jones, you're not allowed to say things that are lies just because you say they're the truth.
[01:09:42.199 --> 01:09:45.080]  And I said, I've never had more than $5 million.
[01:09:45.741 --> 01:09:46.221]  Shut up.
[01:09:47.002 --> 01:09:47.902]  I'll have you arrested.
[01:09:48.482 --> 01:09:49.763]  You saw the judge in Connecticut.
[01:09:49.923 --> 01:09:51.004]  Can't say you're innocent.
[01:09:51.284 --> 01:09:52.605]  Can't say $100 million.
[01:09:52.885 --> 01:09:56.167]  Which you'd be fine if I did, but none of it was ever true.
[01:09:56.767 --> 01:09:57.948]  Not even a grain of it.
[01:09:59.505 --> 01:10:04.127]  So watching Trump go through this, I'm really having, I don't want to call it PTSD flashbacks.
[01:10:05.167 --> 01:10:05.988]  I'm not even angry.
[01:10:06.268 --> 01:10:07.648]  I'm more worried about everybody.
[01:10:08.228 --> 01:10:11.930]  Because let me tell you, they didn't make these decisions to do this to me and then just leave it there.
[01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:15.431]  They're doing this all over the place now.
[01:10:16.732 --> 01:10:26.255]  Democrat judges, mainly against conservatives and conservative companies, from California to Texas, Democrat jurisdictions in Florida, everywhere.
[01:10:26.696 --> 01:10:27.456]  They are just...
[01:10:29.403 --> 01:10:36.326]  Defaulting people or doing a bunch of other weird procedures where they then say, oh, nope, you don't get to put on a defense now.
[01:10:37.366 --> 01:10:39.787]  And so that's a whole other area of discussion.
[01:10:40.287 --> 01:10:44.369]  There's a lot of articles that are being written about it now, and the good news is people are finally getting it.
[01:10:44.769 --> 01:10:47.771]  But see, it's so alien to have rigged trials.
[01:10:49.631 --> 01:10:51.972]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[01:10:51.992 --> 01:10:58.015]  I had a divorce and a custody battle that was highly publicized in the last 10 years, the first three of that.
[01:10:59.014 --> 01:11:01.335]  And the old Travis County judges were all Democrats.
[01:11:02.275 --> 01:11:12.598]  But man, they weighed the evidence and they were like super hardworking and like all over my ass and then gave me my kids.
[01:11:16.579 --> 01:11:25.582]  And even when the lawyers on the other side of my custody battle did a bunch of corrupt stuff and a bunch of deception, a bunch of lying...
[01:11:29.349 --> 01:11:45.239]  The Democrat liberal woman judge who retired right after that, Judge Naranjo, Native American lady, really smart lady, she said, I'm not going to set aside the jury verdict, but if everything isn't done just right in this, custody goes back to him, which it did.
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:51.143]  So I watched judges, when it was the right thing to do, bend over backwards for me.
[01:11:51.723 --> 01:11:52.544]  And they were Democrats.
[01:11:54.205 --> 01:11:57.607]  Now, and I'm only telling the story because it's not about me, it's about what's happened in this country.
[01:12:00.194 --> 01:12:03.095]  Now, every judge is a woman.
[01:12:03.695 --> 01:12:05.155]  I don't care if it's a woman or if it's a good judge.
[01:12:06.155 --> 01:12:07.155]  Every judge is new.
[01:12:07.315 --> 01:12:08.256]  Every judge retired.
[01:12:10.356 --> 01:12:11.196]  All 30-something.
[01:12:11.316 --> 01:12:12.616]  And all of them are new.
[01:12:13.576 --> 01:12:20.898]  And they go from blue-hair Antifa ladies, like my judge, to people almost as bad.
[01:12:21.378 --> 01:12:22.498]  And I talk to Democrats.
[01:12:22.578 --> 01:12:23.778]  And I talk to lawyers.
[01:12:24.318 --> 01:12:26.779]  And I was sitting there in a Kirby Lane about two months ago.
[01:12:28.462 --> 01:12:31.064]  At like 8 a.m., my daughter wanted to go eat food there.
[01:12:31.084 --> 01:12:33.666]  It's like a cafe breakfast place.
[01:12:34.246 --> 01:12:38.029]  They got a little playground where she could play while she waited for the food.
[01:12:38.049 --> 01:12:39.010]  So I took her there.
[01:12:39.471 --> 01:12:40.391]  My wife was out of town.
[01:12:41.452 --> 01:12:46.116]  And I sat behind this group of six lawyers, three women, three men.
[01:12:46.736 --> 01:12:49.118]  They were middle-aged lawyers, but their kids were out there playing too.
[01:12:49.558 --> 01:12:51.460]  They didn't know I was sitting behind them because I came in after them.
[01:12:52.386 --> 01:13:02.209]  And they were like, Judge Guerra Gamble's totally insane and follows none of the law and doesn't even read the cases and is just rude and hateful to everyone and is completely nuts.
[01:13:02.769 --> 01:13:04.910]  And I'm sitting there and I go, oh, yeah, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:13:05.010 --> 01:13:06.711]  And they go, oh, Alex Jones, we know your case.
[01:13:07.211 --> 01:13:10.172]  They turn around and they go, yeah, you got defaulted even though you gave them all the evidence.
[01:13:10.532 --> 01:13:11.732]  No, she does that to everybody now.
[01:13:11.992 --> 01:13:12.833]  She doesn't even care.
[01:13:13.093 --> 01:13:13.753]  She's crazy.
[01:13:15.632 --> 01:13:30.755]  And folks, you look at Fannie Willis in Atlanta and all her crazy corruption, and you look at all these judges are as crazy as E. Jean Carroll.
[01:13:32.175 --> 01:13:37.636]  I mean, look, they're so crazy, I can't even describe to you how crazy they are.
[01:13:37.836 --> 01:13:39.317]  Like, it won't even sound real.
[01:13:40.317 --> 01:13:45.358]  And that's what I'm telling you is, the Democratic Party is like a grip of mentally ill people now.
[01:13:47.179 --> 01:13:54.161]  They are absolutely insane, and this happens in a corruption.
[01:13:54.181 --> 01:13:55.741]  This happens in the fall of a society.
[01:13:55.761 --> 01:14:00.323]  Because you've got some corrupt people and some double dealers, but there's only a few of them.
[01:14:00.343 --> 01:14:07.905]  And then things get more corrupt, and they promote more corrupt people, and the norm becomes greater and greater, and they get away with more and more and more.
[01:14:09.107 --> 01:14:15.340]  To the point of every day I see videos from Portland and New York and Chicago and Austin.
[01:14:15.721 --> 01:14:16.923]  I don't even show you these videos.
[01:14:18.426 --> 01:14:19.990]  And it's liberal men and women.
[01:14:22.372 --> 01:14:31.658]  In business suits, pulling their pants down and pooping in front of schools or climbing up on top of a bus and peeing on the window or peeing in the water fountain.
[01:14:32.119 --> 01:14:32.799]  And you go.
[01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:35.521]  Some are crazy people, homeless people.
[01:14:35.561 --> 01:14:40.304]  Some are like, and then even Portland had like newscasts going, well, it's fun to poop.
[01:14:40.705 --> 01:14:42.606]  This is part of our culture is pooping.
[01:14:42.626 --> 01:14:45.628]  I mean, they're just like, they're degenerates.
[01:14:47.049 --> 01:14:49.791]  And you sit there and you think, oh, well, we're cherry picking this.
[01:14:50.996 --> 01:14:54.758]  No, ladies and gentlemen, they don't care if they get caught.
[01:14:56.399 --> 01:15:09.246]  You know, I played a video a few days ago of a woman famously at a big police press conference who was a fake sign language person, didn't know any sign language.
[01:15:10.807 --> 01:15:12.808]  And she didn't think when she got that job...
[01:15:14.793 --> 01:15:15.473]  We're good to go.
[01:15:45.811 --> 01:15:46.351]  It is real.
[01:15:46.732 --> 01:15:49.534]  They want to be inappropriate.
[01:15:49.634 --> 01:15:51.055]  They want to be bad.
[01:15:51.195 --> 01:15:52.556]  They want to be crazy.
[01:15:53.977 --> 01:16:05.806]  And it's a bunch of incompetent people getting away with murder, both literally and figuratively, who have no thought of the repercussions.
[01:16:06.206 --> 01:16:13.492]  But it's one thing to have a crazy woman that gets a job as a sign language person and they don't even know how to say I love you because they're not going to hurt anybody.
[01:16:15.771 --> 01:16:16.592]  It's just a big joke.
[01:16:16.612 --> 01:16:17.693]  They're going to get caught right away.
[01:16:17.853 --> 01:16:18.774]  Didn't think they'd get caught.
[01:16:18.974 --> 01:16:20.956]  But what about the screening process, the incompetence there?
[01:16:23.479 --> 01:16:26.522]  But what happens when you get that attitude of people to control the nuclear weapons?
[01:16:28.404 --> 01:16:30.266]  What happens when you get that attitude of people to control the border?
[01:16:30.847 --> 01:16:36.132]  What happens when they recruit more and more of their incompetent people in because they don't want anybody looking at the incompetent job they're doing?
[01:16:36.552 --> 01:16:38.875]  In a complex civilization, it falls apart.
[01:16:40.785 --> 01:16:46.112]  And that's the larger plan of the globalists above and the post-industrial world they want.
[01:16:46.812 --> 01:16:51.799]  But don't they know the collapse of civilization is going to bring them down as well?
[01:16:53.422 --> 01:16:58.224]  So what you've got is a lot of faking it until you make it, including Klaus Schwab and all these big ultra-rich people.
[01:16:58.484 --> 01:16:59.464]  They're not in control.
[01:16:59.844 --> 01:17:02.785]  All their systems they're putting in place aren't going to give them the power they want.
[01:17:03.145 --> 01:17:04.486]  It's all going to be their downfall.
[01:17:04.886 --> 01:17:07.567]  But we can't sit there and wait for all that to happen.
[01:17:07.607 --> 01:17:13.729]  We've got to get into the system and stabilize it and bring competency back and turn this around.
[01:17:14.809 --> 01:17:18.991]  And that's really the announcement I wanted to make today about this whole situation.
[01:17:20.499 --> 01:17:23.360]  But this is just a complete mess.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:26.480]  This is so dangerous.
[01:17:27.941 --> 01:17:31.842]  And they just announced in the Navy, you don't need a high school diploma to be in the Navy.
[01:17:32.782 --> 01:17:35.502]  And you can say there's some really smart people that don't have high school diplomas.
[01:17:35.862 --> 01:17:41.544]  The point is they're not getting anybody that's good now because of the wokeism and the poison shots and the purges.
[01:17:43.004 --> 01:17:44.824]  And who are they going to get?
[01:17:44.864 --> 01:17:46.865]  Well, the main force will be illegal aliens.
[01:17:47.827 --> 01:17:48.908]  We're good to go.
[01:18:17.315 --> 01:18:17.856]  We're good to go.
[01:18:42.150 --> 01:18:44.051]  Because parents have no authority over their children.
[01:18:44.071 --> 01:18:44.831]  Everybody gets so upset.
[01:18:45.171 --> 01:18:47.232]  That's official policy all over the country.
[01:18:47.732 --> 01:18:49.992]  They create files on your children in elementary.
[01:18:50.313 --> 01:18:55.594]  They convince them for prizes and toys to say they're another sex.
[01:18:56.094 --> 01:19:10.359]  Then they secretly put them in a file with lawyers and social workers and prepare for the process by the time they're 10 or 11 if the parents don't agree to take them and put them in a weird government pedophile halfway house that five Democrat states have passed laws...
[01:19:10.819 --> 01:19:18.669]  To now take children and under the law in places like Oregon and Washington, they don't even tell you where your child went.
[01:19:18.969 --> 01:19:20.271]  You think they're kidnapped.
[01:19:21.032 --> 01:19:29.703]  The police come and have a fake interview about where your daughter or son is, and they're in a pedophile warehouse being raped.
[01:19:31.564 --> 01:19:32.265]  We're good to go.
[01:19:50.362 --> 01:19:57.587]  And now it's institutionalizing itself to come out of the closet against all of us that are against it because it's all about our soul.
[01:19:58.068 --> 01:20:10.117]  If you can keep your soul, keep your mind, stay focused on the North Star of God and the Holy Spirit and not be sucked in by all this evil and not submit to it, you win.
[01:20:10.137 --> 01:20:15.781]  All right, I'm ranting and I got a lot of news I want to hear and a lot of phone calls I want to take.
[01:20:16.201 --> 01:20:18.443]  Here's the toll-free number on any of these subjects.
[01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:20.000]  877-789-2539.
[01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:20.160]  877-789-Alex.
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:21.101]  There it is on screen.
[01:20:21.121 --> 01:20:21.261]  877-789-2539.
[01:20:21.322 --> 01:20:24.445]  First-time callers, long-time callers, you're all welcome.
[01:20:24.585 --> 01:20:26.107]  All I ask is, have a clear phone line.
[01:20:36.516 --> 01:20:37.858]  And let's just get right to your information.
[01:20:37.878 --> 01:20:38.339]  Because here's the deal.
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:39.401]  I want to thank you.
[01:20:39.441 --> 01:20:40.222]  You want to thank me.
[01:20:40.843 --> 01:20:42.686]  But just like Rush used to say, dittos.
[01:20:43.067 --> 01:20:47.054]  Because imagine you're a regular listener and you're hearing half the call being thanking somebody.
[01:20:47.675 --> 01:20:49.398]  If you want to thank me and I want to thank you.
[01:20:50.675 --> 01:20:56.178]  Spread the word about the broadcast, pray for the broadcast, and buy some great products that enrich your life at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:20:56.498 --> 01:20:59.679]  That's what I'm asking you to do if you're thankful, because I'm thankful for you.
[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:02.201]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:21:02.861 --> 01:21:07.523]  And get a Team Humanity fundraiser shirt, two different variants, limited edition.
[01:21:08.223 --> 01:21:11.085]  Get a 1776 Gadsden flag shirt that I designed, limited edition.
[01:21:12.566 --> 01:21:14.326]  That's what it takes to fund this operation.
[01:21:14.366 --> 01:21:15.547]  Plus, you spread the word.
[01:21:15.587 --> 01:21:19.689]  You wear one of these Team Humanity shirts, you go out in public, you're going to meet a lot of cool people.
[01:21:21.007 --> 01:21:22.008]  Almost get no hate now.
[01:21:23.728 --> 01:21:24.889]  Used to, I'd say, it's an adventure.
[01:21:24.909 --> 01:21:25.910]  You might get murdered.
[01:21:26.670 --> 01:21:30.232]  You might shake 50 hands, but the next person is going to break a bottle over your head.
[01:21:30.532 --> 01:21:31.693]  That's not even really happening now.
[01:21:32.373 --> 01:21:36.815]  But identify with liberty and freedom, and you're going to find your people out there, folks.
[01:21:37.116 --> 01:21:40.818]  And they're black, and they're white, and they're brown, and they're old, and they're young, and they're male, and they're female.
[01:21:41.178 --> 01:21:41.758]  They're everywhere.
[01:21:43.419 --> 01:21:44.700]  So, toll-free number, 877-789-2539.
[01:21:49.494 --> 01:21:49.794]  All right.
[01:21:50.835 --> 01:21:52.357]  Let's get into the border situation.
[01:21:52.377 --> 01:21:54.999]  I got a bunch of clips on that front.
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:22:02.706]  Let's play the senator out of Illinois on this first.
[01:22:04.427 --> 01:22:06.489]  This is really, really important.
[01:22:09.031 --> 01:22:10.553]  And then we're going to continue on.
[01:22:10.593 --> 01:22:15.056]  But the plan is hiring illegal aliens for the military.
[01:22:15.956 --> 01:22:18.958]  That's always been the plan, and that's where we are.
[01:22:18.998 --> 01:22:19.358]  Here it is.
[01:22:21.179 --> 01:22:35.728]  Bill says that if you're an undocumented person in this country, and you can pass the physical and the required test, background test, the like, you can serve in our military, and if you do it honorably, we will make you citizens of the United States.
[01:22:36.508 --> 01:22:37.149]  Do we need that?
[01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:42.752]  You know what the recruiting numbers are at the Army and the Navy and the Air Force?
[01:22:44.198 --> 01:22:46.439]  Here's the latest video from the Texas border.
[01:22:46.499 --> 01:22:49.601]  This is a video of... There's also a video out of California.
[01:22:49.661 --> 01:22:51.422]  There's so many of these.
[01:22:51.442 --> 01:22:52.462]  Of people from China, Turkey, India...
[01:23:12.793 --> 01:23:19.545]  This is in eastern San Diego County, and there's only one single Border Patrol agent in the area.
[01:23:19.625 --> 01:23:21.949]  I mean, it is just a mad bum rush.
[01:23:21.969 --> 01:23:23.312]  We have similar videos out of Texas.
[01:23:23.652 --> 01:23:24.294]  Here's a short clip.
[01:23:48.228 --> 01:23:52.150]  The entire 2,000 plus mile border, it's just non-stop.
[01:23:52.651 --> 01:23:56.693]  Oh, but they're going to grope your testicles at the airport and train you to be a good slave.
[01:23:59.775 --> 01:24:01.536]  This is the social contract being broken.
[01:24:01.556 --> 01:24:03.917]  There go the coyotes, the human smugglers.
[01:24:05.958 --> 01:24:06.779]  Now, here is...
[01:24:08.291 --> 01:24:14.155]  The press secretary saying the president's clear he wants to make sure we deal with the border by total legalization.
[01:24:14.656 --> 01:24:15.977]  He already has the tools to shut it down.
[01:24:15.997 --> 01:24:23.362]  And then here she is saying Biden, again, takes it very seriously, but Trump's refusing to do anything about it.
[01:24:23.402 --> 01:24:23.763]  Here it is.
[01:24:24.543 --> 01:24:31.348]  The president is very clear he wants to make sure that we deal with the border, border security, that we deal with the challenges at the border.
[01:24:34.731 --> 01:24:36.052]  The first day of his administration,
[01:24:38.012 --> 01:24:38.292]  Seriously.
[01:24:38.633 --> 01:24:45.358]  He put forth a comprehensive piece of legislation to deal with what's happening with the immigration.
[01:24:46.079 --> 01:24:50.983]  Wait, let me... You don't get to decide what I say and what I don't say.
[01:24:51.203 --> 01:24:54.546]  Either you hear me out, or I'll see you on Wednesday.
[01:24:54.786 --> 01:24:55.406]  Totally up to you.
[01:24:55.887 --> 01:24:57.028]  Totally up to you.
[01:24:57.128 --> 01:24:57.388]  All right.
[01:24:57.788 --> 01:24:58.069]  Okay.
[01:24:58.649 --> 01:24:58.889]  I was...
[01:24:59.850 --> 01:25:00.971]  He means what he says.
[01:25:01.451 --> 01:25:03.553]  Not going to go into details here.
[01:25:03.853 --> 01:25:05.114]  Here's the reality.
[01:25:05.574 --> 01:25:06.996]  The immigration system is broken.
[01:25:07.216 --> 01:25:10.018]  It's been broken for decades, even in the last administration.
[01:25:10.478 --> 01:25:13.500]  The president introduced this piece of legislation three years ago.
[01:25:13.921 --> 01:25:15.582]  House Republicans got in the way.
[01:25:16.042 --> 01:25:18.044]  They refused to do anything about it.
[01:25:18.064 --> 01:25:24.949]  Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick here in Texas has made a great point.
[01:25:25.069 --> 01:25:27.331]  Everywhere Biden goes, we see nothing but death.
[01:25:29.252 --> 01:25:34.977]  And on the last guest you had and the topics from today, and our prayers go out to those soldiers in Georgia who lost their lives.
[01:25:35.738 --> 01:25:40.122]  Everywhere the president, this president, Biden, moves, death comes with him.
[01:25:40.502 --> 01:25:46.668]  Fenton all across the border, people drowning in the river, people killed here by MS-13, soldiers killed afar.
[01:25:47.048 --> 01:25:53.995]  This president is weak, and in November he will be replaced by Donald Trump, I believe, because the people of America have had enough.
[01:25:57.048 --> 01:25:57.368]  All right.
[01:25:58.229 --> 01:26:00.550]  Now I want to look at the lunatic.
[01:26:00.570 --> 01:26:01.510]  She'll probably sue me.
[01:26:01.571 --> 01:26:01.891]  Fine.
[01:26:01.931 --> 01:26:03.732]  They'll probably say you're not allowed to say that in America.
[01:26:03.872 --> 01:26:12.156]  She's a public figure running around bragging how she's going to spend the money on penthouses and trips to Paris and everything else.
[01:26:12.176 --> 01:26:13.517]  She uses some weird code words.
[01:26:13.557 --> 01:26:15.698]  I'm not sure what they mean about fishing in Paris.
[01:26:16.659 --> 01:26:19.700]  But let's play clip 12.
[01:26:19.801 --> 01:26:23.363]  Rachel Maddow with the loon E. Jean Carroll.
[01:26:23.383 --> 01:26:25.344]  You're not allowed to say you're innocent, Trump.
[01:26:26.385 --> 01:26:28.145]  Bragging what you need to do with Trump's money.
[01:26:28.846 --> 01:26:32.627]  And again, if the appeals court allow this travesty to go through, then the country's done.
[01:26:33.067 --> 01:26:42.649]  By the way, it turns out that the judge was some type of intimate and a mentor with E. Jean Carroll's lawyer.
[01:26:43.269 --> 01:26:45.950]  And the judge has the same last name, but no relation, they're saying.
[01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:47.870]  And there's a bunch of other corruption.
[01:26:47.890 --> 01:26:50.531]  I mean, we already know that.
[01:26:51.311 --> 01:26:53.272]  The judge wouldn't let Trump say he was innocent.
[01:26:54.592 --> 01:26:54.712]  And
[01:26:58.308 --> 01:26:59.448]  Wouldn't let him put on any evidence.
[01:27:00.388 --> 01:27:04.229]  So here's E. Jean Carroll, very, very proud of herself.
[01:27:04.269 --> 01:27:06.569]  This is what a soulless sociopath looks like.
[01:27:07.570 --> 01:27:13.331]  You've talked about using some of Trump's money that you're about to get to help shore up women's rights.
[01:27:13.791 --> 01:27:17.351]  Do you know what that might be, what that might look like?
[01:27:17.431 --> 01:27:18.031]  Yes, Rachel.
[01:27:18.631 --> 01:27:18.992]  Yes.
[01:27:19.012 --> 01:27:19.332]  Tell me.
[01:27:19.792 --> 01:27:25.793]  I had such great ideas for all the good I'm going to do with this money.
[01:27:26.313 --> 01:27:27.253]  First thing, Rachel...
[01:27:27.933 --> 01:27:29.735]  You and I are going to go shopping.
[01:27:30.075 --> 01:27:36.740]  We're going to get completely new wardrobes, new shoes, motorcycle for Crowley, new fishing rod for Robbie.
[01:27:37.041 --> 01:27:37.941]  Rachel, what do you want?
[01:27:37.961 --> 01:27:38.482]  Penthouse?
[01:27:39.042 --> 01:27:40.604]  It's yours, Rachel.
[01:27:40.824 --> 01:27:42.725]  Penthouse and France?
[01:27:42.946 --> 01:27:43.806]  You want France?
[01:27:44.147 --> 01:27:45.488]  You want to go fishing in France?
[01:27:45.748 --> 01:27:45.968]  No?
[01:27:46.989 --> 01:27:48.530]  All right.
[01:27:48.650 --> 01:27:49.231]  That's a joke.
[01:27:51.987 --> 01:27:57.231]  Although, if me fishing in France could do something for women's rights, I would take the hint.
[01:27:57.352 --> 01:28:04.617]  I would obviously take one for the team.
[01:28:05.038 --> 01:28:07.319]  As if you need persuasion in that regard.
[01:28:07.359 --> 01:28:08.741]  Let me finish with a final question.
[01:28:08.761 --> 01:28:11.483]  What a disgusting group of humans.
[01:28:13.291 --> 01:28:18.454]  And you read about Caligula marrying his horse, making it the head of the city.
[01:28:18.494 --> 01:28:19.034]  That's crazy.
[01:28:19.654 --> 01:28:22.396]  It's all about raw exercise of power.
[01:28:22.456 --> 01:28:23.396]  They got the courts.
[01:28:23.996 --> 01:28:25.277]  They got the corporate media.
[01:28:25.317 --> 01:28:26.538]  They got the Justice Department.
[01:28:27.058 --> 01:28:29.239]  And there's nothing they can't do.
[01:28:29.899 --> 01:28:31.500]  Nothing they can't get away with.
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:32.261]  They believe.
[01:28:33.581 --> 01:28:36.823]  And it's a bunch of sick, ugly, weird people.
[01:28:37.823 --> 01:28:38.744]  Disgusting.
[01:28:39.924 --> 01:28:40.985]  Who think they own us.
[01:28:42.145 --> 01:28:43.826]  But you can read it on the wall, folks.
[01:28:44.326 --> 01:28:45.306]  The writing's on the wall.
[01:28:45.967 --> 01:28:47.127]  Their end is here.
[01:28:48.228 --> 01:28:54.590]  Oh, they're going to go kick it and stream it, but it's over for this disgusting leftist Hollywood trash pile.
[01:28:59.613 --> 01:29:08.937]  You know, I sit up here and I yell and scream about the New World Order and the globalists, they're planning to get rid of the borders and release a virus and have a global power grab, and you saw it all come true.
[01:29:10.077 --> 01:29:10.818]  But there's a...
[01:29:12.094 --> 01:29:12.775]  We're good to go.
[01:29:37.033 --> 01:29:42.859]  You can get either one of these great items at 40% off individually or together for 50% off.
[01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:47.063]  Now, the time we have left, I can't tell you why they're so great and what they do for your body.
[01:29:47.464 --> 01:29:52.209]  Go to InfoWarsHore.com, look at the ingredients and investigate it, and then get them.
[01:29:52.509 --> 01:29:55.011]  It supports the InfoWar and it'll change your life.
[01:29:55.592 --> 01:29:56.393]  Take advantage now.
[01:29:56.553 --> 01:29:57.294]  InfoWarsHore.com.
[01:29:59.406 --> 01:30:03.648]  The Second American Revolution is happening now right in front of you.
[01:30:03.949 --> 01:30:08.311]  And you're tuned in to InfoWars because you're either looking for the truth or you're already a patriot.
[01:30:08.771 --> 01:30:16.636]  I'm asking you now to realize we are at the fulcrum, the crossroads in the fight for human destiny and human future.
[01:30:17.376 --> 01:30:18.157]  We're good to go.
[01:30:36.135 --> 01:30:36.775]  We're good to go.
[01:30:36.795 --> 01:30:38.016]  We're good to go.
[01:30:38.056 --> 01:30:38.516]  We're good to go.
[01:30:38.536 --> 01:30:39.737]  We're good to go.
[01:30:59.209 --> 01:31:02.932]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[01:31:03.272 --> 01:31:06.434]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[01:31:06.834 --> 01:31:11.298]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[01:31:11.938 --> 01:31:14.060]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[01:31:14.380 --> 01:31:22.345]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's You Will Eat the Bugs.
[01:31:22.966 --> 01:31:24.287]  This is The Great Awakening.
[01:31:24.807 --> 01:31:28.712]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[01:31:29.172 --> 01:31:32.716]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[01:31:32.976 --> 01:31:35.499]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.

[01:32:10.251 --> 01:32:10.971]  Hey, what's better?
[01:32:11.071 --> 01:32:11.571]  Knockout.
[01:32:11.931 --> 01:32:12.512]  What's better?
[01:32:13.252 --> 01:32:13.732]  Down and out.
[01:32:14.012 --> 01:32:14.472]  What's better?
[01:32:14.532 --> 01:32:16.132]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[01:32:16.813 --> 01:32:21.734]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[01:32:22.432 --> 01:32:26.036]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[01:32:26.397 --> 01:32:27.718]  That's how our bodies work.
[01:32:27.738 --> 01:32:28.639]  They're all very diverse.
[01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:39.211]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night Sleep.

[01:33:00.483 --> 01:33:06.366]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:15.253 --> 01:33:19.115]  The bad news is we're in the bottom of a major cycle of corruption.
[01:33:19.135 --> 01:33:20.976]  The good news is they always end.
[01:33:22.837 --> 01:33:26.019]  And not well for those that run it.
[01:33:26.219 --> 01:33:30.101]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:30.121 --> 01:33:33.103]  All right, here's what I'm going to do.
[01:33:33.143 --> 01:33:35.044]  We've got 12 callers on the board.
[01:33:35.104 --> 01:33:37.586]  That's what the phone system takes on the board.
[01:33:37.626 --> 01:33:40.687]  You can take thousands of calls actually at once, but 12 are on the board.
[01:33:41.428 --> 01:33:43.049]  I'm going to take all 12 of these calls.
[01:33:44.019 --> 01:33:45.420]  And then we'll take more calls in the next hour.
[01:33:45.981 --> 01:33:50.605]  But I'm going to intersperse a lot of breaking news and information.
[01:33:51.245 --> 01:34:02.335]  More mainstream media is being forced to report that the CIA ran around and threatened but then also paid off journalists during the whole COVID operation.
[01:34:02.595 --> 01:34:04.056]  Trump was not aware of this, obviously.
[01:34:04.076 --> 01:34:05.177]  They were working against him as well.
[01:34:05.558 --> 01:34:06.719]  But it expanded under Biden.
[01:34:08.376 --> 01:34:09.701]  Yes, you're up against the CIA.
[01:34:09.841 --> 01:34:10.363]  Big deal.
[01:34:10.684 --> 01:34:11.748]  It's not like the movies, folks.
[01:34:11.768 --> 01:34:14.438]  They're a bunch of criminals that are leftists.
[01:34:15.427 --> 01:34:16.068]  We're good to go.
[01:34:44.741 --> 01:34:46.903]  And I'm not even saying everybody in that system is bad.
[01:34:46.923 --> 01:34:48.263]  It's just like the FBI or any of it.
[01:34:48.324 --> 01:34:51.286]  But it's totally weaponized against the people now.
[01:34:51.866 --> 01:34:54.488]  How the CIA paid and threatened journalists to do its work.
[01:34:55.108 --> 01:34:55.829]  Big article now.
[01:34:57.697 --> 01:35:00.058]  Even out of the Daily Beast, the liberals are reporting on it.
[01:35:00.798 --> 01:35:01.419]  Here's another one.
[01:35:01.479 --> 01:35:05.300]  Transgender runner sets two new records in college women's track and field.
[01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:07.761]  All about just making everything a big joke.
[01:35:07.781 --> 01:35:10.542]  Because if you'll accept that, you'll accept anything.
[01:35:11.443 --> 01:35:17.265]  Democrats warn Trump will secure border with alligator modes, bombing Mexico, spiked and electrified fences.
[01:35:17.685 --> 01:35:17.865]  Ha!
[01:35:18.206 --> 01:35:20.246]  MAGA patriots praise plan.
[01:35:20.266 --> 01:35:23.528]  Of course that's not going to happen, but it's good to just laugh back at them, folks.
[01:35:25.049 --> 01:35:27.531]  Trump defamation case falls apart.
[01:35:27.611 --> 01:35:28.732]  Judge linked to lawyer.
[01:35:29.072 --> 01:35:34.756]  And E. Jean Carroll wants to take Maddow shopping in a Price is Right insane rant.
[01:35:35.737 --> 01:35:36.618]  They're eating their own.
[01:35:36.658 --> 01:35:41.782]  More and more of the Islamic protesters are protesting at Pelosi's house.
[01:35:42.222 --> 01:35:43.923]  Her answer is, go back to China.
[01:35:43.943 --> 01:35:45.264]  I forgot the video of that.
[01:35:45.645 --> 01:35:47.146]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[01:35:48.661 --> 01:35:53.282]  And on, and on, and on.
[01:35:53.382 --> 01:35:55.343]  These people are a joke.
[01:35:56.783 --> 01:35:58.963]  And everything you're seeing is them trying to stay in power.
[01:36:00.424 --> 01:36:09.786]  Then, everybody's asking me, what do I think of Elon Musk reveals the first human has received the Neuralink implant?
[01:36:11.446 --> 01:36:13.807]  Now, I like the direction Elon Musk has taken free speech.
[01:36:16.187 --> 01:36:19.229]  And I'm a big fan of technology to extend life.
[01:36:20.350 --> 01:36:22.631]  But I've got serious concerns about Neuralink.
[01:36:23.532 --> 01:36:25.493]  And it's six after when we start the next hour.
[01:36:25.653 --> 01:36:26.733]  I'm going to talk about that.
[01:36:27.294 --> 01:36:28.174]  That's coming up.
[01:36:28.194 --> 01:36:34.858]  We're going to get a real analysis and I think really a thought-provoking discussion on that.
[01:36:35.199 --> 01:36:38.220]  And that's another subject we could have a whole show debate about.
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:43.944]  Because, hey, if I break my neck in a car wreck, baby, I want a chip that makes me be able to walk.
[01:36:45.114 --> 01:36:48.255]  But the question is, what does it do long term?
[01:36:48.295 --> 01:36:49.195]  It's like the Wright Brothers.
[01:36:49.835 --> 01:36:54.557]  Beautiful, you know, 120 years ago, they take off at Kitty Hawk, or whatever the date was.
[01:36:55.917 --> 01:36:59.318]  And then, 50 years later, they got ICBM missiles.
[01:36:59.399 --> 01:37:03.440]  I mean, it's not a bad thing, but what can it be Trojan horse for?
[01:37:04.180 --> 01:37:05.060]  Flight is great.
[01:37:06.361 --> 01:37:07.921]  Now we can blow up the whole world in five minutes.
[01:37:09.562 --> 01:37:10.402]  Calculators are great.
[01:37:10.502 --> 01:37:11.482]  Now nobody can do math.
[01:37:12.883 --> 01:37:13.103]  So,
[01:37:14.585 --> 01:37:17.347]  We'll be discussing Neuralink coming up.
[01:37:17.427 --> 01:37:18.889]  Also, Soros is on record.
[01:37:19.329 --> 01:37:28.017]  The evil son, Alexander Soros, trying to stop farmers, protesting being shut down by carbon taxes.
[01:37:28.557 --> 01:37:32.120]  What a little monster, claiming he's for the average person.
[01:37:33.274 --> 01:37:35.155]  I mean, just look at the look in that eye.
[01:37:35.175 --> 01:37:36.136]  You think that's a predator?
[01:37:36.976 --> 01:37:40.598]  Even worse than his father, who got rich robbing old people's pension funds.
[01:37:41.298 --> 01:37:44.900]  He makes Gordon Gekko, the fictional character on Wall Street, look like Jesus.
[01:37:45.661 --> 01:37:48.222]  Alright, let's go ahead and go to Thor in Texas.
[01:37:48.342 --> 01:37:50.123]  Thor, you're on the air.
[01:37:50.143 --> 01:37:56.847]  Hey Alex, I think men need to take the positions that the women have taken over.
[01:37:57.327 --> 01:38:00.309]  We have judges, we have city council women, we have
[01:38:01.369 --> 01:38:01.949]  We're good to go.
[01:38:02.029 --> 01:38:02.249]  I think?
[01:38:20.908 --> 01:38:21.609]  Well, I'll say this.
[01:38:21.889 --> 01:38:22.350]  I'll say this.
[01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:25.955]  The WEF, the New World Order, is putting women in charge to bring down civilization.
[01:38:25.995 --> 01:38:27.056]  The type of woman they're choosing...
[01:38:37.449 --> 01:38:46.674]  Has a chip on their shoulder and is totally behind the globalists and will commit any crime you can imagine because they know epigenetically we think of a man as committing a crime.
[01:38:47.014 --> 01:38:50.436]  We know that most violent crime is men, so we are wary of men.
[01:38:50.877 --> 01:38:56.320]  So yeah, they're putting women in as the spokespersons and as the functionaries to carry out the tyranny.
[01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:57.000]  There's no doubt of it.
[01:38:57.220 --> 01:39:05.125]  I mean, every judge in Travis County, they're elected, put in by George Soros, all the men and women removed before...
[01:39:06.606 --> 01:39:07.026]  Right.
[01:39:07.086 --> 01:39:12.832]  They should drug test these people.
[01:39:13.673 --> 01:39:16.356]  They're probably all on pharmaceuticals, some kind of mood elevators.
[01:39:16.956 --> 01:39:18.037]  I don't think there's any choice.
[01:39:18.057 --> 01:39:19.739]  I mean, I don't think there's any question about that.
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:22.001]  I mean, it's just true.
[01:39:23.431 --> 01:39:31.237]  And again, there's lots of competent black people, but they choose black people that will follow the New Order agenda all over the place as well.
[01:39:31.317 --> 01:39:35.660]  I mean, it's just, and then they announce, oh, under the ESGs, we're not hiring any more white people.
[01:39:35.941 --> 01:39:38.903]  It's just, they're making us all fight with each other.
[01:39:39.343 --> 01:39:40.604]  It is a divide and conquer plan.
[01:39:40.644 --> 01:39:41.204]  Thanks for the call.
[01:39:42.766 --> 01:39:43.746]  Sylvia in Maine.
[01:39:43.806 --> 01:39:44.407]  Thanks for calling.
[01:39:44.427 --> 01:39:44.927]  You're on the air.
[01:39:46.468 --> 01:39:47.709]  Hi, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:49.411]  Such an honor to speak with you.
[01:39:49.731 --> 01:39:50.271]  Honor's mine.
[01:39:51.512 --> 01:39:52.293]  You truly are.
[01:39:52.473 --> 01:39:52.673]  Just,
[01:39:53.677 --> 01:39:54.037]  Well, you're great.
[01:39:54.057 --> 01:39:54.337]  Thank you.
[01:39:54.357 --> 01:39:55.238]  Oh, we're not... Women are awesome.
[01:39:55.258 --> 01:39:57.780]  We're not... They are manipulating a certain group of women.
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:39:59.281]  Let's be clear.
[01:40:17.728 --> 01:40:18.168]  Your books.
[01:40:18.369 --> 01:40:18.969]  I mean, gosh.
[01:40:19.970 --> 01:40:24.133]  I just want to say also the Dr. Jones Natural, the silver skin serum.
[01:40:24.173 --> 01:40:26.015]  I'm about to leave a comment on that.
[01:40:26.035 --> 01:40:31.480]  That stuff is just beautiful for my skin and the cream and the wound dressing, all of the silver products, the toothpaste.
[01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:34.022]  I've got my children off the floor.
[01:40:35.463 --> 01:40:36.404]  Okay.
[01:40:37.184 --> 01:40:39.706]  I wanted to talk a little bit about the border.
[01:40:39.806 --> 01:40:42.809]  So even if Trump does close the border up fully...
[01:40:45.478 --> 01:40:50.319]  You know, Chyna, I read the book about the belt in Panama and what they're doing, actually, all over the world.
[01:40:50.879 --> 01:41:02.602]  And I have a friend in Panama, and she pretty much told me that about one in four of the residents now in the Republic of Panama are Chinese, ethnic Chinese.
[01:41:03.323 --> 01:41:09.144]  And Chyna controls the Panama being asked by her.
[01:41:10.205 --> 01:41:13.649]  Oh, we've got the video from Michael Yan and others, and also...
[01:41:28.275 --> 01:41:30.036]  The muckraker reporters, absolutely.
[01:41:30.116 --> 01:41:33.977]  And again, you go to China, it's all about male masculinity, all about male dominance.
[01:41:34.557 --> 01:41:37.298]  Oh, but here, China funds Hollywood to say men are bad.
[01:41:37.898 --> 01:41:39.918]  They just want us weak so they can take us over.
[01:41:41.899 --> 01:41:47.320]  So, I mean, even if we close the border, China, they have permanent structures in place.
[01:41:47.380 --> 01:41:48.421]  They're not going to stop.
[01:41:48.741 --> 01:41:49.061]  That's right.
[01:41:51.545 --> 01:41:52.106]  We're good to go.
[01:42:14.338 --> 01:42:14.398]  Yes.
[01:42:14.418 --> 01:42:14.578]  Yes.
[01:42:14.758 --> 01:42:15.018]  Yes.
[01:42:39.249 --> 01:42:41.173]  Well, here's why they're controlled.
[01:42:41.213 --> 01:42:47.985]  They have family in China that if they don't do what they're told, their mother and brothers and sisters and fathers go to forced labor camps.
[01:42:48.546 --> 01:42:49.748]  Thank you so much, Sylvia.
[01:42:49.788 --> 01:42:50.269]  Great points.
[01:42:50.749 --> 01:42:52.452]  Anonymous and others, we'll come right back to you.

[01:45:04.810 --> 01:45:09.174]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[01:45:09.634 --> 01:45:12.097]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[01:45:12.657 --> 01:45:22.045]  But now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.

[01:46:49.083 --> 01:46:54.965]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep, because you will be down and out.
[01:46:55.245 --> 01:46:58.686]  Selling out now at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:47:00.487 --> 01:47:06.369]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:16.731 --> 01:47:18.773]  Excuse me?
[01:47:20.134 --> 01:47:32.245]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[01:47:32.405 --> 01:47:35.448]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[01:47:39.731 --> 01:47:41.891]  It's a military mission in North St.
[01:47:41.931 --> 01:47:42.271]  Louis.
[01:47:42.571 --> 01:47:49.633]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town, and don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[01:47:49.793 --> 01:47:54.314]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[01:47:54.594 --> 01:47:55.454]  Guns will be taken.
[01:47:55.494 --> 01:47:56.694]  No one will be able to be armed.
[01:47:56.994 --> 01:47:57.974]  We will take all weapons.
[01:47:58.174 --> 01:48:00.495]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[01:48:00.555 --> 01:48:04.916]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[01:48:05.116 --> 01:48:05.376]  Enough.
[01:48:05.976 --> 01:48:06.236]  Enough.
[01:48:06.777 --> 01:48:07.057]  Enough.
[01:48:07.837 --> 01:48:08.038]  Enough.
[01:48:08.198 --> 01:48:12.681]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[01:48:12.781 --> 01:48:16.844]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[01:48:17.104 --> 01:48:23.289]  And as KSLA News 12's Jeff Farrell discovered, the clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem.
[01:48:23.969 --> 01:48:24.069]  Us.
[01:48:24.309 --> 01:48:32.215]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:48:32.335 --> 01:48:34.857]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[01:48:35.925 --> 01:48:37.646]  Somebody else made that happen.
[01:48:38.347 --> 01:48:44.371]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[01:48:44.651 --> 01:48:49.314]  Blackhawk choppers soaring into the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[01:48:49.614 --> 01:48:54.297]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect house to house.
[01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:07.046]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[01:49:07.507 --> 01:49:08.588]  In your apartment!
[01:49:08.689 --> 01:49:09.810]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:10.931]  Go back inside right now!
[01:49:11.031 --> 01:49:11.812]  I am inside.
[01:49:12.093 --> 01:49:13.154]  I have two words for you.
[01:49:13.995 --> 01:49:14.836]  Predator drones.
[01:49:15.817 --> 01:49:16.799]  You will never see it coming.
[01:49:20.859 --> 01:49:23.620]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras.
[01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:32.863]  Parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[01:49:32.963 --> 01:49:38.165]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in, and now they're coming in like they're trespassers, punching and shoving people.
[01:49:38.405 --> 01:49:43.146]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down.
[01:49:43.466 --> 01:49:45.587]  If you want them, come and take them!
[01:49:47.148 --> 01:49:48.649]  We are on the march.
[01:49:48.949 --> 01:49:51.550]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:49:51.811 --> 01:49:56.593]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:49:57.013 --> 01:50:06.398]  I wanted to run that old promo from like six, seven years ago before Trump even got into office.
[01:50:06.478 --> 01:50:07.519]  Hell, eight years ago now.
[01:50:08.319 --> 01:50:09.780]  Hard to believe how much time has flown.
[01:50:10.701 --> 01:50:12.542]  That the feds have been trying to build a war.
[01:50:12.582 --> 01:50:12.842]  Right.
[01:50:14.170 --> 01:50:14.370]  I think?
[01:50:38.328 --> 01:50:46.776]  Still, though, enough people that are even somewhat awake don't take it how serious it is that this New World Order and what they're up to is front and center.
[01:50:46.856 --> 01:50:47.617]  It's everything.
[01:50:49.059 --> 01:50:52.942]  There's all these political movements and weird side-issued stuff.
[01:50:53.383 --> 01:50:55.565]  This show really is over the target.
[01:50:55.885 --> 01:50:58.288]  The listeners that care about what's happening, you're over the target.
[01:50:59.108 --> 01:51:00.309]  We know how to counter the enemy.
[01:51:00.350 --> 01:51:01.010]  We've been right.
[01:51:01.070 --> 01:51:01.811]  We've been proven right.
[01:51:01.851 --> 01:51:02.652]  We've been vindicated.
[01:51:03.891 --> 01:51:11.337]  People need to be listening to you, not just me, about what we should do because you're the long-term folks that cared about the truth and that bet on freedom.
[01:51:11.357 --> 01:51:14.040]  And now, look at all the people that sound just like us.
[01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:16.722]  That's because the worm's turning, folks, and I see that as positive.
[01:51:17.042 --> 01:51:23.408]  I don't go, well, I've been doing this the longest of any modern person and I've been put through the most hell other than Trump and why aren't I getting all the credit?
[01:51:23.908 --> 01:51:25.690]  The credit is victory over the tyranny.
[01:51:26.250 --> 01:51:28.732]  Anonymous in Texas on Abbott and the border.
[01:51:29.233 --> 01:51:29.673]  Go ahead.
[01:51:29.693 --> 01:51:30.334]  Thanks for calling.
[01:51:31.528 --> 01:51:32.209]  Hi, Alex.
[01:51:32.709 --> 01:51:33.169]  Can you hear me?
[01:51:33.189 --> 01:51:33.449]  I can.
[01:51:33.469 --> 01:51:34.070]  Go ahead.
[01:51:34.710 --> 01:51:34.970]  Okay.
[01:51:35.531 --> 01:51:40.054]  So I wanted to add something that no one is talking about as far as Abbott is concerned.
[01:51:40.114 --> 01:51:45.138]  I've heard, you know, you and Michael Yon discuss, is he wet, is he not?
[01:51:45.158 --> 01:51:46.839]  And I'll tell you why I know he is.
[01:51:47.539 --> 01:51:51.422]  Because I've been getting involved at the county level with our elections.
[01:51:53.223 --> 01:52:00.128]  And it's all of Abbott's people at the county level who are fighting to keep the machines in our elections working.
[01:52:00.598 --> 01:52:03.821]  To keep the ballots not marked, sequentially numbered.
[01:52:04.882 --> 01:52:08.086]  And I've met these people, and I've seen them face-to-face.
[01:52:08.686 --> 01:52:13.792]  They are evil, and they're trying to steal our right to vote away from us.
[01:52:14.673 --> 01:52:20.679]  And they're Abbott people, and they are the ones who were behind the Ken Paxton thing, the impeachment.
[01:52:25.305 --> 01:52:28.307]  Well, it does look like Greg Abbott is definitely playing both sides of the bare minimum.
[01:52:28.347 --> 01:52:28.728]  I hear you.
[01:52:28.808 --> 01:52:33.412]  And our reporters are down there now, and he's done a little bit of the barbed wire, and he's had a little bit of the fight with the feds.
[01:52:33.432 --> 01:52:34.552]  He's got a bunch of states involved.
[01:52:34.592 --> 01:52:40.938]  But they're still in other areas of the Eagle Pass processing the illegals and handing them over to the feds.
[01:52:41.018 --> 01:52:43.239]  So that's what I'm hearing from locals as well.
[01:52:43.299 --> 01:52:45.461]  So what do we do about Greg Abbott?
[01:52:47.243 --> 01:52:51.026]  Well, I think the thing that we have to do is people have to get involved at the county level.
[01:52:51.066 --> 01:52:52.647]  We have so few people in our county.
[01:52:53.453 --> 01:52:56.134]  A small group of patriots, and they're up there fighting like hell.
[01:52:56.674 --> 01:53:03.277]  And our GOP chair, who is very corrupt, doesn't own property in our county, lives in a house owned by someone in D.C.
[01:53:04.477 --> 01:53:12.580]  He illegally contracted our primary after the precinct chairs voted no, not for the contract, because the ballots are not numbered.
[01:53:13.741 --> 01:53:17.442]  So if we can't fix it there, then we can't fix it.
[01:53:20.089 --> 01:53:20.610]  I hear you.
[01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:22.311]  Tell me to get President Trump in.
[01:53:22.911 --> 01:53:23.932]  We don't need new laws.
[01:53:23.952 --> 01:53:24.853]  The laws are all there.
[01:53:24.873 --> 01:53:26.294]  Biden is ignoring all the laws.
[01:53:27.916 --> 01:53:28.276]  Correct.
[01:53:28.976 --> 01:53:31.398]  I think it's just people have to take part and see what goes on.
[01:53:31.439 --> 01:53:34.461]  And this is at the GOP, at your county level.
[01:53:34.781 --> 01:53:36.182]  Absolutely.
[01:53:36.203 --> 01:53:38.805]  The word is Abbott is basically a Bush-controlled person.
[01:53:40.206 --> 01:53:42.027]  Yes, that's what everybody says.
[01:53:42.047 --> 01:53:44.710]  I just started pulling back the curtain and getting involved.
[01:53:44.770 --> 01:53:46.211]  I went to a meeting in November.
[01:53:46.914 --> 01:53:48.516]  Well, what they are is a bunch of backstabbing lawyers.
[01:53:48.636 --> 01:53:49.377]  I appreciate your calling.
[01:54:09.090 --> 01:54:14.473]  Now, since we talk about Abbott a lot here on the show and ask, you know, is he controlling the border or is he not?
[01:54:14.613 --> 01:54:16.253]  We've been down there a bunch the last few years.
[01:54:16.333 --> 01:54:17.474]  Our videos have been filed.
[01:54:17.994 --> 01:54:25.538]  We posted them here on X. Or they come up to myself, Owen Shroyer, other reporters, and the State Guard tells us, turn your cameras off at midnight or 2 a.m.
[01:54:25.758 --> 01:54:30.900]  when they got all these buses coming across of men, women, and children, and many of them unaccompanied children.
[01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:35.022]  And they admit hundreds of thousands of children under Biden have been smuggled into the U.S.
[01:54:35.042 --> 01:54:36.223]  So we know that...
[01:54:36.963 --> 01:54:39.644]  Abbott's been talking a lot of talk, but he's been aiding it so far.
[01:54:40.044 --> 01:54:42.085]  Now at least at Eagle Pass, he backed it up.
[01:54:42.946 --> 01:54:44.046]  He backed up the illegals.
[01:54:44.106 --> 01:54:45.567]  He put the barbed wire in.
[01:54:46.067 --> 01:54:49.528]  But a few miles down the road, he's still waving them through with the State Guard.
[01:54:49.588 --> 01:54:50.669]  Our reporters are down there.
[01:54:50.689 --> 01:54:51.969]  The video's coming out.
[01:54:52.069 --> 01:54:52.810]  It's going viral.
[01:54:53.786 --> 01:55:16.148]  But the World Economic Forum is a globalist organization of the UN to penetrate governments and to give corporate support to governors and mayors and senators and state congresspeople and federal legislators to carry out the New World Order, to penetrate the cabinets as Klaus Schwab famously talked about with David Gergen as he...
[01:55:16.869 --> 01:55:21.211]  Klaus Schwab famously talked about with David Gergen at the Kennedy School.
[01:55:21.732 --> 01:55:23.353]  And we'll play that clip in a moment as well.
[01:55:23.873 --> 01:55:33.238]  But here's a new clip of him being asked about the WEF, and he won't even denounce it when he knows it's been one of the hottest topics for years, even on Fox News.
[01:55:33.518 --> 01:55:34.319]  This is pretty damning.
[01:55:38.415 --> 01:55:41.117]  Germany.
[01:55:41.177 --> 01:55:42.078]  Germany.
[01:55:42.158 --> 01:55:42.478]  Germany.
[01:55:42.638 --> 01:55:43.719]  Germany.
[01:55:56.690 --> 01:56:01.192]  Do you denounce the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, and the Great Reset?
[01:56:01.252 --> 01:56:02.933]  Listen, I'm not a globalist.
[01:56:03.033 --> 01:56:05.414]  I'm a Texas person, an American Klaus person.
[01:56:05.454 --> 01:56:08.095]  But do you denounce Klaus Schwab and the Great Reset?
[01:56:08.255 --> 01:56:11.077]  I promote Texas and America.
[01:56:11.337 --> 01:56:14.338]  All right, we'll not denounce them.
[01:56:14.398 --> 01:56:17.860]  So here is Klaus Schwab explaining how they control and run our lives.
[01:56:19.745 --> 01:56:33.089]  And I have to say, when I mention our names, like Mrs. Merkel, even Vladimir Putin and so on, they all have been young global leaders of the World Economic Forum.
[01:56:36.030 --> 01:56:48.860]  What we are very proud of now is the young generation, like Prime Minister Trudeau, President of Argentina and so on, that we penetrate the cabinets.
[01:56:49.481 --> 01:56:56.846]  So yesterday I was at a reception for Prime Minister Trudeau, and I...
[01:56:58.058 --> 01:57:09.527]  We know that half of this cabinet, or even more, half of this cabinet, are actually young global leaders of the world economy.
[01:57:10.108 --> 01:57:11.309]  And that's true in Argentina, too.
[01:57:12.029 --> 01:57:12.270]  Wow.
[01:57:13.070 --> 01:57:13.270]  Sorry.
[01:57:13.511 --> 01:57:14.852]  That's true in Argentina, as well.
[01:57:15.272 --> 01:57:18.855]  It's true in Argentina, and it's true in France now.
[01:57:19.015 --> 01:57:22.258]  I mean, with the president, with the young global leader.
[01:57:22.318 --> 01:57:24.760]  But what is important for me...
[01:57:25.427 --> 01:57:31.049]  So it's one thing to have been part of the WEF or go speak at it once and then say you're against it later.
[01:57:31.589 --> 01:57:35.310]  It's another thing entirely to not denounce it.
[01:57:35.370 --> 01:57:37.111]  That is damning of Greg Abbott.
[01:57:37.771 --> 01:57:41.112]  All right, hour number three, your phone calls straight ahead.
[01:57:41.593 --> 01:57:45.434]  Greg Abbott's got a lot of explaining to do and our reporters are on the ground at the border.
[01:57:49.232 --> 01:57:51.494]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[01:57:51.674 --> 01:57:52.014]  Thank you.
[01:57:52.214 --> 01:57:54.736]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[01:57:54.756 --> 01:57:56.097]  I started taking that stuff.
[01:57:56.137 --> 01:57:59.320]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:00.341]  When did you start taking it?
[01:58:00.621 --> 01:58:04.544]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[01:58:05.164 --> 01:58:05.325]  Mm-hmm.
[01:58:05.345 --> 01:58:05.465]  Mm-hmm.
[01:58:21.482 --> 01:58:22.763]  I think we're good to go.
[01:58:49.138 --> 01:58:50.699]  I'm not on Team NFL.
[01:58:50.999 --> 01:58:52.479]  I'm not on Team NBA.
[01:58:52.680 --> 01:58:53.640]  I'm not on Team Olympics.
[01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:57.382]  I'm not on Team Globalist or Wokeism in the New World Order.
[01:58:57.602 --> 01:59:07.826]  I'm on Team Humanity, ladies and gentlemen, that loves God and loves our families and loves humanity and knows that we're destined to do even more incredible things than we've already done together.
[01:59:08.006 --> 01:59:11.688]  And so, inspired by my conversation with Elon Musk recently...
[01:59:12.068 --> 01:59:12.568]  We're good to go.
[01:59:29.136 --> 01:59:29.496]  Wear it.
[01:59:29.756 --> 01:59:38.079]  It's a great conversation starter, and you know it's supporting the InfoWar that is at the very tip of the spear in the fight for Team Humanity.
[01:59:38.399 --> 01:59:43.161]  Get your limited edition Team Humanity t-shirts right now at InfoWarStore.com, and I thank you.
[01:59:52.243 --> 01:59:56.185]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:59:59.235 --> 02:00:02.878]  Warn of false flags to try to predict horrible events.
[02:00:03.418 --> 02:00:06.161]  We warn of false flags to try and prevent them.
[02:00:06.601 --> 02:00:09.703]  They are the norm for starting massive conflicts.
[02:00:10.204 --> 02:00:15.128]  They are based on lies, and so we only hope that the truth will make them futile.
[02:00:15.608 --> 02:00:23.915]  Last week, I reported on rumors that Victoria Nuland was planning a false flag attack on a Ukrainian nuclear power plant.
[02:00:24.455 --> 02:00:34.519]  There is now talk in Kiev that the real president of Ukraine, Victoria Nuland, has become so desperate for NATO troops to enter Ukraine and continue this U.S.
[02:00:34.599 --> 02:00:42.463]  proxy war against Russia that she is willing to murder innocent locals with a radioactive cloud and blame it on Russian forces.
[02:00:43.383 --> 02:00:50.768]  After that report, documentary filmmaker Chris Emery, who has spent years researching PATCON, the U.S.
[02:00:50.808 --> 02:01:04.857]  intelligence operation to use false flags as a way of criminalizing American patriots, reached out to me with some information that shows how this is standard operating procedure for the black hats in our government.
[02:01:05.137 --> 02:01:13.241]  We had done our first movie premiere in March of that year in Salt Lake City with an attorney that we actually interviewed on the film by the name of Jesse Trinidou.
[02:01:13.661 --> 02:01:27.468]  He was approached by a command team leader that was in charge of 10, including himself, basically commandos, to blow up the Bronze Ferry nuclear power plant in Athens, Alabama under the Operation PATCON.
[02:01:27.888 --> 02:01:38.388]  And then Jesse went into detail about what PatCon was, which would later morph into the Waco attack, and then the Oklahoma City bombing, and then our current, present-day...
[02:01:40.455 --> 02:01:41.356]  I think we're good to go.
[02:02:02.519 --> 02:02:06.421]  ...partners, there were 10 commandos all together, were given duffel bags full of cash.
[02:02:06.541 --> 02:02:07.662]  Each were given $5 million.
[02:02:08.523 --> 02:02:10.644]  They left it in the parking lot in the wee hours.
[02:02:11.145 --> 02:02:19.370]  He said between 2.30 and 3 o'clock in the morning, they literally left these duffel bags in the parking lot, in the far end of the parking lot, away from the nuclear power plant and drove away.
[02:02:19.390 --> 02:02:24.354]  And they basically told their commanding officer at the Pentagon to F off.
[02:02:24.874 --> 02:02:28.357]  We are dealing with people that are of the occult, are in a dark...
[02:02:29.309 --> 02:02:33.113]  Dark corner of the universe that we can't even imagine.
[02:02:33.614 --> 02:02:37.458]  And Newland is in that pack with Eric Garland and several others.
[02:02:38.078 --> 02:02:38.719]  Without a doubt.
[02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:44.965]  She needs to be brought up on treason and indicted, put on trial and thrown in prison.
[02:02:45.346 --> 02:02:46.247]  And the key tossed away.
[02:02:46.607 --> 02:02:58.316]  We also spoke on the subject of what looks to be the beginning of a false flag being set up on the southern border, with World Economic Forum puppet Greg Abbott now calling for a civil war.
[02:02:58.576 --> 02:02:59.637]  What in the world?
[02:02:59.677 --> 02:03:02.339]  Why did it take him almost two and a half years to gear up?
[02:03:02.499 --> 02:03:02.940]  I think it's...
[02:03:04.625 --> 02:03:05.266]  He could have...
[02:03:21.457 --> 02:03:23.178]  Put the thumbscrew on there a long time ago.
[02:03:23.258 --> 02:03:26.099]  Why he chose to do so now is beyond me.
[02:03:26.239 --> 02:03:27.179]  They're much more keen.
[02:03:27.199 --> 02:03:41.044]  They have the operative radar on high alert now, and they'll be able to hopefully weed out a lot of these operatives that, whether they know it or not, are being paid by the feds to be the fly in the ointment and get a lot more people in trouble.
[02:03:41.124 --> 02:03:43.625]  It's just going to be a reincarnation of J6 all over again.
[02:03:44.045 --> 02:03:51.355]  Expert on false flags and the southern border crisis, Michael Yon, is also warning people not to fall for the trap.
[02:03:51.795 --> 02:03:58.765]  And we already know that the so-called, I call it OGUS, the Occupational Government of the United States, we already know that it's out of control.
[02:03:58.805 --> 02:03:59.726]  We already know that it...
[02:04:00.206 --> 02:04:04.610]  The only rules that it plays by is anything it can get away with, it will do, right?
[02:04:04.830 --> 02:04:05.691]  We already know that.
[02:04:06.011 --> 02:04:07.272]  We saw January 6th.
[02:04:07.692 --> 02:04:12.636]  We see Americans have to show their ID and get searched and whatnot to get on airplanes.
[02:04:12.976 --> 02:04:14.457]  Meanwhile, they got illegals.
[02:04:14.978 --> 02:04:22.564]  I mean, straight up invaders coming across the border by the thousands every day that can board aircraft without any ID.
[02:04:22.624 --> 02:04:23.665]  There are no rules.
[02:04:24.305 --> 02:04:25.726]  We are clearly being hunted.
[02:04:26.286 --> 02:04:30.249]  And, I mean, the American citizens, patriots, are clearly being hunted.
[02:04:30.549 --> 02:04:33.591]  They're looking for any excuse to go to war, and they will do it.
[02:04:33.891 --> 02:04:36.532]  I mean, obviously, there's going to be a very serious war.
[02:04:36.572 --> 02:04:37.713]  There's a little more to the report.
[02:04:37.993 --> 02:04:39.234]  It's up on Band.Video.
[02:04:39.294 --> 02:04:41.255]  I'm going to post it on X in the next 30 minutes.
[02:04:41.655 --> 02:04:43.516]  False flag warning for martial law in the U.S.
[02:04:43.616 --> 02:04:44.297]  and war with Russia.
[02:04:44.677 --> 02:04:46.478]  This is an emergency maximum alert.
[02:04:46.738 --> 02:04:51.700]  You want to stop the globalists, get this report out like your life depends on it, because it does.
[02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:53.100]  It's at van.video.
[02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:55.902]  It's going on Real Alex Jones and X. Now the rest is up to you.
[02:04:55.922 --> 02:04:56.682]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds.
[02:04:59.308 --> 02:05:03.592]  29 years on air, all I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalists.
[02:05:04.292 --> 02:05:09.617]  And I've done the best job I can to tell those words that have been accurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[02:05:10.017 --> 02:05:12.559]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves.
[02:05:12.980 --> 02:05:17.363]  Unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people, we don't do that.
[02:05:17.844 --> 02:05:19.725]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[02:05:20.105 --> 02:05:22.127]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product.
[02:05:22.167 --> 02:05:22.748]  It's so powerful.
[02:05:23.669 --> 02:05:33.742]  This is the breakdown product after your cells process it of folic acid, methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[02:05:34.183 --> 02:05:35.425]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[02:05:35.465 --> 02:05:36.306]  It's not a stimulant.
[02:05:36.566 --> 02:05:38.389]  It energizes your cells.
[02:05:38.949 --> 02:05:42.332]  It doesn't just energize this operation against the tyrants, it energizes you.
[02:05:42.613 --> 02:05:44.154]  Get foundational energy now!
[02:06:00.831 --> 02:06:02.973]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:03.493 --> 02:06:08.678]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:09.559 --> 02:06:12.981]  All right, we believe in freedom, and we've had a lot of victories, thanks to God.
[02:06:13.702 --> 02:06:16.745]  Thanks to God working through you, and we're swinging for the fences here.
[02:06:17.525 --> 02:06:18.426]  Against the New World Order.
[02:06:18.526 --> 02:06:25.292]  We're dedicated American patriot Christians who understand that if we submit to this tyranny, it'll be ten times worse.
[02:06:25.833 --> 02:06:28.115]  And if we stand up, we can make the world a better place.
[02:06:28.155 --> 02:06:29.076]  Plus, God's watching.
[02:06:29.456 --> 02:06:30.897]  That's why we're really doing this at the end of the day.
[02:06:30.917 --> 02:06:36.082]  Alright, later in the hour, I'll get into Elon Musk and Neuralink and the big new developments there.
[02:06:37.423 --> 02:06:38.865]  But I promise to go to your calls.
[02:06:38.885 --> 02:06:40.646]  I'm going to race through your calls here in a moment.
[02:06:40.746 --> 02:06:40.926]  But...
[02:06:41.806 --> 02:06:44.608]  We have great IT people and great IT companies.
[02:06:45.449 --> 02:06:55.857]  Despite all the hack attacks and all the brute force attacks and all the denial of service attacks and all the infiltration operations, we don't make a big deal about it because we're warriors.
[02:06:56.297 --> 02:06:57.118]  We're in the fight.
[02:06:57.458 --> 02:06:58.399]  We're here every day.
[02:06:58.719 --> 02:07:01.881]  It's our job to just stay on air and cover the issues and not get distracted.
[02:07:03.883 --> 02:07:10.528]  It has been years since I had the IT companies we use come to me and say, you need to talk about this on air.
[02:07:13.624 --> 02:07:17.847]  So if you try to go to InfoWars.com, you may see a quick security screen that comes up.
[02:07:17.867 --> 02:07:21.008]  It says scanning to make sure you're not a bot before you get in.
[02:07:22.870 --> 02:07:29.754]  As of this morning, in the last 24 hours, over a billion bots, not connections, bots.
[02:07:31.014 --> 02:07:32.815]  One bot might be sending a million people at us.
[02:07:34.056 --> 02:07:36.938]  So we've had tens of billions, if not hundreds of billions...
[02:07:41.753 --> 02:07:45.934]  Of bots attack us, and we have some big companies that work with us.
[02:07:45.994 --> 02:07:47.595]  We don't promote who they are, so they don't get attacked.
[02:07:48.195 --> 02:07:57.538]  They said this morning, this is the biggest brute force attack they've ever seen, not just against their companies, but they've read about.
[02:07:58.278 --> 02:08:04.720]  They said, listen, this was a multi-million dollar payment to do this.
[02:08:07.335 --> 02:08:08.877]  And we're still up at Band.Video.
[02:08:09.137 --> 02:08:10.799]  We're still up at InfoWars.com.
[02:08:11.179 --> 02:08:11.860]  We're still up.
[02:08:12.360 --> 02:08:22.370]  And we've seen massive fake flagging on X of fake reports against us to pull down our live feeds, but then some get taken down, they get put back up.
[02:08:22.751 --> 02:08:29.438]  Just like we've seen fake community notes, stuff on us that isn't true, and then somebody's doing their job at X, they remove the community note.
[02:08:31.304 --> 02:08:39.451]  So, the average person doesn't have enough visibility to get these attacks, and if you do, you don't have enough visibility to expose them.
[02:08:40.532 --> 02:08:46.997]  But I just wanted to point out that over a billion bots, as of 8 a.m.
[02:08:47.017 --> 02:08:52.922]  this morning, I haven't checked since, some of the bots sending millions of requests individually.
[02:08:53.550 --> 02:09:02.859]  So over a billion bots, some of them sending millions of requests apiece, others hundreds of thousands, are hitting InfoWars.com and Man.Video.
[02:09:04.341 --> 02:09:06.903]  And it's not just the brute force attack.
[02:09:07.304 --> 02:09:08.405]  There's a bunch of other attacks.
[02:09:08.825 --> 02:09:10.687]  Why is it happening?
[02:09:12.068 --> 02:09:12.589]  I don't know.
[02:09:13.069 --> 02:09:16.253]  I don't know what it is I'm covering that's got them so pissed, but I've got a good guess.
[02:09:17.538 --> 02:09:24.743]  Every time we expose Victoria Nuland and them trying to do a false flag, they've already tried to blow up that reactor repeatedly.
[02:09:24.963 --> 02:09:27.184]  They've already said the Russians blew it up when it wasn't true.
[02:09:27.204 --> 02:09:35.329]  It even came out later, they had to admit that Ukrainian forces keep shelling the biggest nuclear reactor in the world.
[02:09:36.410 --> 02:09:38.191]  Miles down the road from Chernobyl.
[02:09:40.032 --> 02:09:44.135]  And I don't know if that's it, but gut level, I notice this happens often.
[02:09:45.788 --> 02:09:53.111]  When we put out hardcore reports like the Greg Reese report you just saw, because he put one out a few days ago as well, on the false flag attempted attacks on the reactor.
[02:09:53.411 --> 02:09:56.532]  So let's put on screen Greg Reese's new report.
[02:09:57.313 --> 02:09:59.533]  We're going to post it on X as well in the next few minutes.
[02:10:00.654 --> 02:10:10.658]  But I have an expert guess, a dead reckoning that that's what it is, because you do certain things and, boy, you get burned.
[02:10:11.991 --> 02:10:12.551]  I think we're good to go.
[02:10:42.219 --> 02:10:45.302]  It's now live at real Alex Jones.
[02:10:46.923 --> 02:10:50.145]  I've also noticed when I call out Alexander Soros, this stuff happens.
[02:10:51.086 --> 02:11:02.155]  And people that work for the system think that I'm a coward like them, that when I step up to the plate and I get hit hard, that I think, oh my God, I better not go this direction.
[02:11:02.315 --> 02:11:06.098]  And listen, I'm not the toughest guy around, but I am pig-headed like Trump.
[02:11:07.319 --> 02:11:10.682]  And when somebody gets in my face and attacks me, I can't help it.
[02:11:12.042 --> 02:11:17.983]  I remember growing up in Dallas, man, and it might have been a 250-pound badass started a fight with me, and I couldn't run.
[02:11:18.003 --> 02:11:19.343]  I couldn't back down.
[02:11:20.084 --> 02:11:21.584]  I couldn't bow.
[02:11:23.024 --> 02:11:25.565]  And at first, they'd start beating the living hell out of me.
[02:11:26.445 --> 02:11:29.325]  But I'd black out, and they'd be going home in the ambulance.
[02:11:30.446 --> 02:11:31.206]  Almost every time.
[02:11:32.286 --> 02:11:36.027]  One time I took on five guys, and they broke my leg because they attacked me first, but they got me.
[02:11:37.087 --> 02:11:39.888]  But the point is that I won almost all those fights.
[02:11:39.908 --> 02:11:41.568]  And it's the same thing here.
[02:11:42.591 --> 02:11:48.293]  And I've almost reached the level that what I'm doing on this show is I am blacked out, folks.
[02:11:50.114 --> 02:11:54.576]  I'll use the analogy of Star Wars Episode IV where Luke Skywalker is right in the trench.
[02:11:54.656 --> 02:11:55.697]  Everybody else has been killed.
[02:11:56.741 --> 02:12:00.582]  And the force tells him, turn off your computer, hit that target yourself.
[02:12:00.962 --> 02:12:02.382]  And that's called blacking out, folks.
[02:12:02.942 --> 02:12:17.065]  I am literally, have my computers turned off, nobody's telling me what to do with the Holy Spirit, I am in the trench, they're blowing up our ships all around us, and it's all about Jesus right now, and I'm going in against that reactor shaft, and I'm going to fire that torpedo.
[02:12:19.265 --> 02:12:21.446]  Or, anybody coming in behind me is going to do it.
[02:12:22.066 --> 02:12:22.206]  But,
[02:12:23.459 --> 02:12:23.900]  We're good to go.
[02:12:37.936 --> 02:12:42.858]  If Han Solo hadn't decided, hey, it doesn't matter if it's a suicide mission, I'm going to show up and see what I can do.
[02:12:43.238 --> 02:12:50.860]  And it's going to be federal whistleblowers and schoolteacher whistleblowers and auto mechanics and farmers and nuclear engineers.
[02:12:51.420 --> 02:12:55.902]  And it's going to be you that are going to be the Han Solos in this fight, folks.
[02:12:56.342 --> 02:12:59.122]  Right at the moment, we're ready to pull the trigger and blow the Death Star up.
[02:12:59.643 --> 02:13:02.443]  If you're not there backing us up, we're going to get taken out.
[02:13:02.824 --> 02:13:03.764]  And you along with us.
[02:13:04.244 --> 02:13:05.946]  And you know when I say that, that isn't rhetoric.
[02:13:06.407 --> 02:13:08.989]  There, as Trump said a thousand times, it's so true.
[02:13:10.191 --> 02:13:11.372]  They're not coming after me.
[02:13:11.552 --> 02:13:13.074]  They're coming after you.
[02:13:13.234 --> 02:13:13.975]  I'm just in the way.
[02:13:14.075 --> 02:13:15.116]  You got that, folks?
[02:13:15.297 --> 02:13:16.117]  I bet on you.
[02:13:16.278 --> 02:13:17.239]  I believe in you.
[02:13:17.739 --> 02:13:23.085]  I don't want to go grovel to the system and grovel to the lawyers and kiss the ass of the New World Order.
[02:13:23.205 --> 02:13:24.227]  I already got offered.
[02:13:25.242 --> 02:13:32.284]  Hundreds of millions of dollars to serve them, and they told me, and you'll be left alone, and you can be a star, and you can have fun.
[02:13:32.505 --> 02:13:33.205]  Well, guess what?
[02:13:33.485 --> 02:13:37.566]  I don't want to be in some fancy penthouse with a private jet and be a sellout.
[02:13:37.906 --> 02:13:44.229]  Now, if I can fight tyranny and promote prosperity and empower humanity, give me a penthouse with private jets and big-ass stakes, I'll take them.
[02:13:44.429 --> 02:13:46.369]  But they're way down my hierarchy of needs.
[02:13:48.550 --> 02:13:50.711]  My hierarchy of needs is doing what God says.
[02:13:51.891 --> 02:13:53.172]  And I love being persecuted.
[02:13:54.130 --> 02:13:54.671]  We're good to go.
[02:14:15.762 --> 02:14:16.463]  We're good to go.
[02:14:26.135 --> 02:14:26.876]  We're good to go.
[02:14:26.896 --> 02:14:27.076]  I think?
[02:14:49.835 --> 02:14:53.716]  Because we got something to deliver and God said deliver it.
[02:14:53.976 --> 02:14:57.016]  And I'm going to deliver more payloads.
[02:14:57.777 --> 02:15:01.657]  The reason I volunteered for more missions is we have slayed the enemy.
[02:15:01.877 --> 02:15:03.198]  We have destroyed them.
[02:15:03.438 --> 02:15:04.638]  We have wrecked them.
[02:15:04.918 --> 02:15:07.119]  God has given me nothing but victory.
[02:15:07.979 --> 02:15:18.621]  And the idea now, when I've been given nothing but victory, that I won't continue the missions and I won't continue hammering them, but I can't do it without you.
[02:15:20.014 --> 02:15:29.902]  God's given me the intellect, and God's given me the will, and God's given me the capacity to do this, but I can't do it without you.
[02:15:29.942 --> 02:15:38.189]  And I sit here and think about all the heavy subjects, and I'm up here begging, oh, buy my t-shirt, oh, please buy my supplement, please get my water.
[02:15:38.530 --> 02:15:40.872]  I don't want to even be doing that.
[02:15:40.992 --> 02:15:42.293]  You need all this stuff.
[02:15:42.493 --> 02:15:43.434]  It's all excellent.
[02:15:45.367 --> 02:15:50.710]  But I'll go commercial free the minute one of these billionaires gets off the fence and bankrolls this operation.
[02:15:51.210 --> 02:15:55.172]  We need $50 million a year to stay on air and expand.
[02:15:56.553 --> 02:15:57.233]  And we don't have it.
[02:15:58.114 --> 02:15:59.194]  That's gross sales.
[02:15:59.614 --> 02:16:01.796]  We need like $30 million a year to operate.
[02:16:02.796 --> 02:16:04.497]  Where are you getting a better bang for the buck?
[02:16:05.658 --> 02:16:06.338]  Shall I tell you now?
[02:16:07.867 --> 02:16:12.550]  Nitric Boost became a bestseller because Dr. Judy Mikovich talked about it and what a great product it is.
[02:16:12.570 --> 02:16:14.431]  She has nothing to do with it, but it's got all the ingredients.
[02:16:14.451 --> 02:16:19.133]  She says one of the best formulas she's seen to clean out your blood and empower your heart and brain and your arteries.
[02:16:19.353 --> 02:16:21.354]  Young, old, everybody should be on it.
[02:16:21.675 --> 02:16:28.278]  And now we even went to a bigger manufacturer and got an even higher quality, stronger version that just came in today on the 18-wheeler.
[02:16:28.758 --> 02:16:31.420]  And it is Nitric Boost, InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:16:34.790 --> 02:16:35.390]  Or 888-253-3139.
[02:16:35.730 --> 02:16:36.831]  You need nitric boost.
[02:16:36.871 --> 02:16:37.251]  It's there.
[02:16:37.831 --> 02:16:38.431]  Selling out.
[02:16:38.511 --> 02:16:39.512]  I wish we'd done a bigger run.
[02:16:39.932 --> 02:16:43.253]  Next Level Foundational Energy, methylfolate, all the B-complex.
[02:16:43.613 --> 02:16:44.234]  It's available.
[02:16:44.614 --> 02:16:46.715]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:16:48.311 --> 02:16:49.412]  Or 888-253-3139.
[02:16:50.713 --> 02:16:51.914]  Get a signed copy.
[02:16:51.934 --> 02:16:54.196]  That's a fundraiser in my book, The Great Awakening.
[02:16:54.557 --> 02:16:55.417]  I need your support.
[02:16:55.538 --> 02:16:56.198]  I'm thankful.
[02:16:56.759 --> 02:16:58.981]  And I want to thank all of you that got it and did support.
[02:16:59.001 --> 02:17:06.047]  But I'm really talking to the 99% of you, and it's way more than that now, that hear this show and never buy a damn thing.
[02:17:07.328 --> 02:17:13.554]  How could you see a broadcast with guests and analysis that changed the world and then not want to support it?
[02:17:15.165 --> 02:17:18.547]  Hell, go make a straight donation at m4shore.com or defensejones.com.
[02:17:18.647 --> 02:17:28.234]  All I'm saying is we're in the fight, folks, and I'll get the damn airplane, and I'll start the engines, and I'll take off, and I'll fly over the enemy, and I'll drop the truth on their ass all day.
[02:17:28.454 --> 02:17:40.023]  But if I don't got bombs getting loaded and jet fuel or diesel getting put or kerosene getting put in the engines, I can't take the son of a bitch off, and I can't go do it.
[02:17:40.891 --> 02:17:48.498]  And we've already had all glory to God, at the level of God, all support to you for your support, all credit to the audience.
[02:17:49.600 --> 02:17:57.067]  We've already, I'll use the analogy, it's like we go to Las Vegas the last 29 years on air, and we put a quarter in the slot machine, we win $1,000.
[02:17:57.107 --> 02:18:00.650]  We go play blackjack, and we spend $1,000, we make $100,000.
[02:18:02.779 --> 02:18:04.340]  We go to the roulette wheel, we make a million.
[02:18:04.380 --> 02:18:05.622]  We never even lose!
[02:18:06.382 --> 02:18:19.474]  I get tortured, I get attacked, I get lied about, I get physically attacked, people come to my house, I don't even get into that, what that's like for my family, but as long as I don't care, and as long as I got courage and trust in God, like Job did, we have...
[02:18:20.074 --> 02:18:20.534]  We're good to go.
[02:18:20.594 --> 02:18:20.915]  I think?
[02:18:45.410 --> 02:18:46.510]  So empower me.
[02:18:46.990 --> 02:18:47.811]  Energize me.
[02:18:48.091 --> 02:18:48.751]  Pray for me.
[02:18:49.091 --> 02:18:50.031]  Buy the products.
[02:18:50.731 --> 02:18:51.732]  Get off the fence.
[02:18:52.952 --> 02:18:53.752]  God's watching.
[02:18:55.692 --> 02:18:56.633]  Plus, they're great products.
[02:18:57.173 --> 02:18:58.013]  I'm done talking about it.
[02:18:58.913 --> 02:18:59.953]  All right, I'm sorry to the callers.
[02:19:00.013 --> 02:19:00.914]  I've been ranting for 25 minutes.
[02:19:00.934 --> 02:19:06.295]  We're going to go to your calls now.
[02:19:07.466 --> 02:19:09.169]  We're going to cover all the topics and all the issues.
[02:19:09.190 --> 02:19:10.412]  I appreciate you.
[02:19:10.432 --> 02:19:11.093]  We're going on the order.
[02:19:11.474 --> 02:19:12.436]  Your calls are received.
[02:19:12.657 --> 02:19:13.839]  Let's go to John in Texas.
[02:19:13.859 --> 02:19:14.601]  John, you're on the air.
[02:19:14.641 --> 02:19:14.961]  Go ahead.
[02:19:16.634 --> 02:19:17.854]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[02:19:17.894 --> 02:19:20.915]  Good afternoon to you, and good afternoon to everybody listening.
[02:19:21.195 --> 02:19:24.496]  I'm going to try to make this brief, about three minutes or less.
[02:19:24.656 --> 02:19:24.976]  Go ahead.
[02:19:25.096 --> 02:19:32.098]  I just want to start off with a big shout-out to all the unseen heroes of the InfoWar, all the techies working behind the scenes.
[02:19:32.778 --> 02:19:35.598]  If it wasn't for them, we would not have this broadcast.
[02:19:35.638 --> 02:19:37.319]  And a big shout-out to you, Alex.
[02:19:37.799 --> 02:19:42.320]  I've been listening to you since you made an appearance on Coast to Coast AM in the early 2000s.
[02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:44.881]  And they were doing a show on 9-11.
[02:19:45.001 --> 02:19:47.203]  I've been plugged into the InfoWar ever since.
[02:19:48.404 --> 02:19:49.985]  On to my comments that I wanted to make today.
[02:19:50.465 --> 02:19:58.150]  I just wanted to share with you and the entire audience something I've been sharing with friends for a few years now, that America is not over.
[02:19:58.991 --> 02:20:02.413]  We are not over here in America, and America is not over.
[02:20:03.414 --> 02:20:06.196]  And I really don't like to focus too much... No, I totally agree.
[02:20:06.276 --> 02:20:08.057]  And we have to mentally say we're not over.
[02:20:08.097 --> 02:20:09.158]  They're trying to demoralize us.
[02:20:09.398 --> 02:20:10.319]  They're over!
[02:20:10.339 --> 02:20:12.420]  The New World Order is out of hand!
[02:20:13.971 --> 02:20:19.435]  And, you know, there's a lot of losses that do happen, but we need to focus on wins.
[02:20:19.595 --> 02:20:23.738]  Just like T-Pain said, all I do is win, win, win, no matter what.
[02:20:24.819 --> 02:20:26.280]  And so we're going to keep winning.
[02:20:26.880 --> 02:20:38.969]  And just a big thing that's been happening in this country during the Biden presidency has been the efficacy, and we can have the discussion of what degree of efficacy it is,
[02:20:39.469 --> 02:20:50.374]  But the efficacy of checks and balances, and we have had several Supreme Court rulings over the past several years that have upheld justice in the face of tyranny.
[02:20:51.174 --> 02:20:54.096]  And so there are a lot of other comments that I could make.
[02:20:54.116 --> 02:20:55.957]  For those that don't know, you might want to mention those.
[02:20:55.997 --> 02:21:01.179]  They said the bureaucracies can't make law outside of congressional law, but they're still doing it.
[02:21:02.338 --> 02:21:02.758]  Yes, sir.
[02:21:02.798 --> 02:21:03.218]  Yes, sir.
[02:21:03.999 --> 02:21:06.179]  But yeah, that's just kind of a little summary.
[02:21:06.219 --> 02:21:07.080]  Roe v. Wade?
[02:21:07.120 --> 02:21:08.020]  We can keep going here.
[02:21:08.260 --> 02:21:08.460]  Yeah.
[02:21:08.760 --> 02:21:09.020]  Yeah.
[02:21:09.060 --> 02:21:09.240]  Yeah.
[02:21:09.280 --> 02:21:09.841]  Roe v. Wade.
[02:21:09.881 --> 02:21:10.781]  And there are several others.
[02:21:10.821 --> 02:21:14.682]  We could talk about mask things, COVID stuff.
[02:21:14.902 --> 02:21:16.003]  There's been a lot of rulings.
[02:21:16.043 --> 02:21:18.744]  The CDC saying they control all property and rents?
[02:21:20.004 --> 02:21:20.204]  Yeah.
[02:21:20.304 --> 02:21:24.786]  And so... Can you imagine how bad it'd be if we didn't have a half-assed good court like we got?
[02:21:26.285 --> 02:21:26.706]  Exactly.
[02:21:26.786 --> 02:21:30.068]  And so I just wanted to share that with everybody that, you know, we still do have checks and balances.
[02:21:30.588 --> 02:21:33.551]  We still do have a shining light of freedom in this country.
[02:21:34.351 --> 02:21:35.912]  And, you know, I hear it a lot.
[02:21:36.012 --> 02:21:36.593]  I hear it a lot.
[02:21:36.633 --> 02:21:40.095]  You know, I don't know if our country can take another four years of this.
[02:21:42.257 --> 02:21:43.077]  And I pray to God.
[02:21:43.138 --> 02:21:47.621]  If we got up off our asses, we could lead every one of these illegal aliens out of the New World Order.
[02:21:48.041 --> 02:21:50.281]  Then they'd be power to freedom.
[02:21:50.402 --> 02:21:50.862]  Exactly.
[02:21:51.062 --> 02:21:52.522]  We can overcome anything.
[02:21:52.722 --> 02:21:55.383]  We already have the base, the infrastructure to do it, and we got God.
[02:21:55.583 --> 02:21:56.743]  But we got to decide we got it.
[02:21:57.923 --> 02:21:58.363]  Yes, sir.
[02:21:58.383 --> 02:21:58.823]  Yes, sir.
[02:21:58.843 --> 02:22:00.864]  So, yeah, that's just my message to everyone.
[02:22:01.144 --> 02:22:02.504]  Keep focusing on the positive.
[02:22:03.324 --> 02:22:05.805]  We are going to win, and we're going to keep winning.
[02:22:06.625 --> 02:22:08.885]  And so with that, I'm going to hang up and listen.
[02:22:09.125 --> 02:22:10.686]  And thank you very much, and God bless.
[02:22:11.006 --> 02:22:11.586]  Thank you, John.
[02:22:14.336 --> 02:22:20.540]  In a war, we're one of the main attack ships and we're under massive fire because we're kicking enemy ass up and down the street.
[02:22:21.080 --> 02:22:24.242]  I'm busier than a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest, folks.
[02:22:24.542 --> 02:22:26.423]  We got so many targets, so many stories.
[02:22:26.603 --> 02:22:28.504]  Just victory, victory, victory, victory, victory!
[02:22:33.908 --> 02:22:34.948]  Bart in Georgia.
[02:22:34.968 --> 02:22:35.569]  Thanks for calling.
[02:22:35.589 --> 02:22:35.909]  Go ahead.
[02:22:37.432 --> 02:22:37.932]  Yes, sir.
[02:22:37.972 --> 02:22:40.614]  I want to talk about this Fannie Willis.
[02:22:40.674 --> 02:22:42.975]  She can't understand normal thinking.
[02:22:43.635 --> 02:22:45.016]  And I just want to be more positive.
[02:22:45.036 --> 02:22:46.357]  She's a retarded gremlin.
[02:22:46.697 --> 02:22:47.898]  She's a retarded gremlin.
[02:22:48.838 --> 02:22:52.040]  And I don't think we talk about good news as much as we should.
[02:22:52.100 --> 02:22:54.281]  This is fantastic for Trump.
[02:22:54.601 --> 02:22:56.102]  And we don't even know the half of it.
[02:22:56.202 --> 02:22:59.764]  That worm is a degenerate criminal put in by Soros.
[02:22:59.784 --> 02:23:01.465]  They're all a bunch of freaking kooks.
[02:23:01.885 --> 02:23:03.326]  All a bunch of freaking scum.
[02:23:04.602 --> 02:23:08.043]  Evidently, she thinks her job is to have sex with the other lawyers.
[02:23:08.063 --> 02:23:09.804]  I don't know what's going on here, but this is crazy.
[02:23:09.824 --> 02:23:14.786]  Well, that's one thing, but it's all the 600,000, now the millions that's coming out.
[02:23:15.086 --> 02:23:18.087]  That's a money laundering, scamming, dirty little rat.
[02:23:19.547 --> 02:23:20.628]  Yeah, where's the money?
[02:23:21.108 --> 02:23:22.308]  200 grand's missing at least.
[02:23:23.829 --> 02:23:25.370]  For trips to everywhere.
[02:23:27.170 --> 02:23:28.070]  Thank you for having me on.
[02:23:28.090 --> 02:23:28.771]  No, no, anything else.
[02:23:28.851 --> 02:23:30.511]  I mean, what are people saying about this in Georgia?
[02:23:30.831 --> 02:23:31.992]  How obvious is all this?
[02:23:33.175 --> 02:23:35.136]  Oh, oh, everybody's on top of it.
[02:23:35.156 --> 02:23:36.117]  She can't hide.
[02:23:37.758 --> 02:23:41.520]  You know, she's just a disgusting so-called human being.
[02:23:41.540 --> 02:23:43.781]  Well, look at the type of scum they've got to get to do this stuff.
[02:23:43.801 --> 02:23:44.842]  I mean, they're a bunch of trash.
[02:23:46.422 --> 02:23:47.163]  Absolutely.
[02:23:47.203 --> 02:23:48.263]  This is unbelievable.
[02:23:48.283 --> 02:23:48.944]  But you know what?
[02:23:48.964 --> 02:23:50.024]  This is how God works.
[02:23:50.164 --> 02:23:51.085]  It got exposed.
[02:23:52.066 --> 02:23:54.547]  And it's because we don't give up and Trump doesn't give up.
[02:23:54.847 --> 02:23:55.607]  You don't give up.
[02:23:55.668 --> 02:23:56.648]  You let it play out.
[02:23:56.728 --> 02:23:58.109]  Let them keep thinking they're winning.
[02:23:58.189 --> 02:23:59.470]  Let them keep licking their lips.
[02:23:59.850 --> 02:24:01.751]  Let them keep having fun, and they're going to get it.
[02:24:03.604 --> 02:24:04.024]  Yeah, sir.
[02:24:04.044 --> 02:24:10.768]  And one last thing I have to say, after the show's over later on, go to Bart Von and Rumble and Bitchy's and watch the Alex Jones Show, please.
[02:24:11.028 --> 02:24:11.508]  All right, buddy.
[02:24:11.528 --> 02:24:12.108]  Appreciate you.
[02:24:12.429 --> 02:24:13.669]  Jack in New York.
[02:24:13.709 --> 02:24:14.790]  Thanks for holding your own here.
[02:24:14.830 --> 02:24:15.170]  Go ahead.
[02:24:16.611 --> 02:24:17.151]  Yeah, hi there.
[02:24:17.871 --> 02:24:21.673]  I wanted to throw out a topic that I don't think has been getting covered very much.
[02:24:22.474 --> 02:24:24.035]  It's something I've been researching.
[02:24:24.115 --> 02:24:30.298]  It's this idea about the Omniverse, Earth 2, second Earth by NVIDIA.
[02:24:31.089 --> 02:24:32.149]  Yeah, that was first done 20 years ago.
[02:24:32.169 --> 02:24:34.970]  Headline, Yeah, and this is tied in to the 3D body scans at the airport.
[02:24:35.030 --> 02:24:36.811]  Do you think they deleted your 3D body image at the airport?
[02:24:38.031 --> 02:24:41.112]  No, they use it to then put it in the computers to read you while you walk down the street.
[02:24:59.986 --> 02:25:04.670]  Yeah, and the facial recognition, the gait recognition, this is the beast system.
[02:25:05.310 --> 02:25:10.374]  And the entire thing, they can basically record Earth in real time, I think.
[02:25:10.394 --> 02:25:11.475]  I mean, I can't prove that.
[02:25:11.495 --> 02:25:12.376]  Yeah, no, no, no, it's the Internet.
[02:25:12.416 --> 02:25:13.296]  No, no, that's their goal.
[02:25:13.316 --> 02:25:15.298]  They've already got a lot of it done, Internet of Things.
[02:25:15.658 --> 02:25:19.001]  And then meanwhile, they want to grow up your genitals and scan you at the airport while the border's wide open.
[02:25:19.101 --> 02:25:19.981]  It's all a fraud.
[02:25:20.842 --> 02:25:28.328]  Yeah, well, I think this is a big topic that could be a topic for a deep dive, maybe a documentary by somebody out there.
[02:25:28.388 --> 02:25:29.589]  I 1 trillion percent agree with you.
[02:25:30.586 --> 02:25:30.726]  Yep.
[02:25:31.327 --> 02:25:32.347]  Well, tell us more about it.
[02:25:32.407 --> 02:25:33.968]  Go ahead.
[02:25:34.009 --> 02:25:35.830]  Well, I'm trying to go through.
[02:25:35.850 --> 02:25:37.031]  I have a few notes here.
[02:25:37.431 --> 02:25:40.513]  The facial recognition in China was basically the beta test for it.
[02:25:40.533 --> 02:25:42.835]  You can see they basically have it operational.
[02:25:42.855 --> 02:25:47.318]  But it's really this idea they can record life on Earth.
[02:25:47.378 --> 02:25:54.823]  And Musk touched on this a little bit in his announcement about the Neuralink today, whether you're going to have a personal digital avatar.
[02:25:55.304 --> 02:25:58.306]  And they're rolling this out with the kids and the gamification of everything.
[02:25:59.701 --> 02:26:02.063]  It's pretty freaky.
[02:26:02.343 --> 02:26:04.024]  So that was my idea.
[02:26:04.084 --> 02:26:06.486]  And I have a few other comments about some other topics if I can.
[02:26:06.927 --> 02:26:07.307]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:26:08.808 --> 02:26:16.675]  Can you provide the info on the kid that the African-Americans curb stomped yesterday and provide the information about the... You know, that's a great search.
[02:26:16.695 --> 02:26:24.822]  When I put that out going off the Alex Jones war site, it's not ours, they thought it was another story, but it looks like it wasn't that story.
[02:26:25.722 --> 02:26:28.424]  And so it's a real video, but we're trying to figure that out.
[02:26:28.464 --> 02:26:29.344]  The search is going on.
[02:26:29.404 --> 02:26:31.765]  Elon Musk has requested us to find out.
[02:26:31.785 --> 02:26:32.906]  He commented on the video.
[02:26:34.107 --> 02:26:38.649]  I probably spent an hour last night and 30 minutes this morning trying to find it.
[02:26:38.669 --> 02:26:40.110]  What do you think we should do?
[02:26:41.231 --> 02:26:41.851]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:26:41.871 --> 02:26:43.872]  I was trying to search it all night last night.
[02:26:43.912 --> 02:26:46.353]  I can't find any more information about it.
[02:26:48.524 --> 02:26:50.184]  Well, that's because there's so many of these videos.
[02:26:50.585 --> 02:26:55.526]  I found, like, dozens of other similar cases, and I can't even link them up.
[02:26:55.706 --> 02:26:58.927]  We found one that might be it, but it's not it.
[02:27:00.327 --> 02:27:05.169]  Yeah, that video's got, like, what, 30 million views right now on Real Alex Jones?
[02:27:06.112 --> 02:27:07.433]  Oh yeah, it's terrible.
[02:27:07.693 --> 02:27:08.414]  It's sad.
[02:27:09.495 --> 02:27:15.820]  This younger generation has to get a hold of themselves and stop this madness.
[02:27:15.860 --> 02:27:19.423]  Like you said, it's being promoted in the media and it's disgusting.
[02:27:20.043 --> 02:27:20.724]  What's the other point?
[02:27:22.958 --> 02:27:28.001]  New York City, if you look into their New York immigration office, they have a DACA dreamer.
[02:27:28.041 --> 02:27:33.245]  He's on a $200,000 a year salary running the immigration racket in New York City.
[02:27:33.265 --> 02:27:34.285]  They're not trying to stop it.
[02:27:34.906 --> 02:27:36.367]  They're trying to... Oh, yeah, yeah.
[02:27:36.387 --> 02:27:37.548]  They act like they're against it.
[02:27:37.568 --> 02:27:38.728]  They just want more federal funds.
[02:27:38.769 --> 02:27:39.229]  Great point.
[02:27:40.109 --> 02:27:40.370]  Yeah.
[02:27:41.030 --> 02:27:41.610]  Thank you, sir.
[02:27:42.011 --> 02:27:42.391]  Thank you.
[02:27:43.652 --> 02:27:43.972]  All right.
[02:27:44.132 --> 02:27:49.256]  We're going to go to break, go to Baldy, and then we're going to go to everybody else who already received.
[02:27:49.516 --> 02:27:50.737]  Alex and...
[02:27:51.809 --> 02:27:57.453]  Dorletta and Jefferson and Gene and Stephen and Anthony.
[02:27:58.614 --> 02:27:59.454]  We're going to take your calls.
[02:27:59.494 --> 02:28:00.735]  The order they are received.
[02:28:00.775 --> 02:28:02.677]  So start your engines.
[02:28:02.737 --> 02:28:04.098]  I'm giving each caller like two, three minutes.
[02:28:04.118 --> 02:28:06.419]  I really need to give you all about a minute so we get to more of you.
[02:28:06.639 --> 02:28:07.680]  So just spill it.
[02:28:08.160 --> 02:28:08.461]  Say it.
[02:28:09.321 --> 02:28:11.983]  By the way, I sound obnoxious when a caller starts saying something.
[02:28:12.243 --> 02:28:13.524]  But I go, oh, yeah, this is not.
[02:28:13.544 --> 02:28:14.865]  I'm not trying to be, oh, I'm so smart.
[02:28:15.165 --> 02:28:17.547]  When I hear a caller saying something true, I want you to know it's true.
[02:28:19.095 --> 02:28:20.696]  They couldn't find the articles from like 10 years ago.
[02:28:21.196 --> 02:28:27.698]  Pentagon creates artificial map of the world, artificial world, and tracks all the things in lifetime.
[02:28:27.718 --> 02:28:30.599]  So what he's talking about, the companies he mentioned, I've seen those articles.
[02:28:30.639 --> 02:28:31.299]  That's true.
[02:28:31.820 --> 02:28:32.300]  That's going on.
[02:28:32.320 --> 02:28:33.820]  But they need you to opt into it.
[02:28:34.200 --> 02:28:35.161]  They need you to be part of it.
[02:28:35.181 --> 02:28:41.423]  And it's the war game, the social credit score, the ESG, the central bank digital currency to control every facet of your life.
[02:28:41.503 --> 02:28:42.463]  It is the mark of the beast.
[02:28:42.623 --> 02:28:43.223]  It is here.
[02:28:43.744 --> 02:28:44.504]  It's all happening.
[02:28:44.884 --> 02:28:46.467]  Alright, we're going to go to break, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:28:47.028 --> 02:28:48.110]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.

[02:28:52.599 --> 02:28:53.140]  Stay with us.
[02:28:53.240 --> 02:28:54.181]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:57.663 --> 02:29:05.846]  Cellular damage from a type of free radical known as reactive oxygen species can cause decreased cellular function.
[02:29:06.207 --> 02:29:13.069]  DNA Force Plus contains what are believed to be the most beneficial ingredients to remedy this.

[02:29:17.971 --> 02:29:21.973]  The main ingredient in the real red pill plus is pregnenolone.
[02:29:22.313 --> 02:29:26.156]  Which occurs naturally in our body, but decreases with age.
[02:29:26.656 --> 02:29:31.579]  Low levels of pregnenolone are associated with fatigue and low brain function.
[02:29:31.979 --> 02:29:39.964]  The real Red Pill Plus is also full of essential trace minerals to synergistically support optimal cognitive function.

[02:29:58.392 --> 02:30:01.513]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:30:01.533 --> 02:30:03.153]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:30:03.833 --> 02:30:06.894]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:30:07.755 --> 02:30:11.696]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers...
[02:30:13.143 --> 02:30:15.846]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:30:16.687 --> 02:30:22.654]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[02:30:23.595 --> 02:30:24.496]  It's really just incredible.
[02:30:25.504 --> 02:30:28.367]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:30:28.387 --> 02:30:34.153]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:30:34.934 --> 02:30:35.855]  I know you spread the word.
[02:30:35.895 --> 02:30:37.377]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[02:30:37.417 --> 02:30:37.938]  Keep doing it.
[02:30:37.978 --> 02:30:44.605]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[02:30:45.045 --> 02:30:46.227]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[02:30:46.907 --> 02:30:50.550]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Enforce.com.
[02:30:51.210 --> 02:30:55.834]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Enforce.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:30:56.154 --> 02:30:56.995]  Please take action now.
[02:30:57.175 --> 02:30:58.776]  I'm not on Team NFL.
[02:30:59.076 --> 02:31:00.577]  I'm not on Team NBA.
[02:31:00.757 --> 02:31:01.718]  I'm not on Team Olympics.
[02:31:02.018 --> 02:31:05.421]  I'm not on Team Globalist or Wokeism in the New World Order.
[02:31:05.681 --> 02:31:08.363]  I'm on Team Humanity, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:08.643 --> 02:31:09.283]  We're good to go.
[02:31:37.210 --> 02:31:37.550]  Wear it.
[02:31:37.830 --> 02:31:39.511]  It's a great conversation starter.
[02:31:39.871 --> 02:31:46.153]  And you know it's supporting the InfoWar that is at the very tip of the spear in the fight for Team Humanity.
[02:31:46.474 --> 02:31:51.135]  Get your limited edition Team Humanity t-shirts right now at InfoWarStore.com and I thank you.
[02:31:57.369 --> 02:32:01.030]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[02:32:01.770 --> 02:32:06.471]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:32:07.011 --> 02:32:18.913]  They are both clones of national best-selling products from a major pharmaceutical-slash-supplement maker that are listeners and patriots that are allowing us to private label it at a lower price than you'll find in stores.
[02:32:19.353 --> 02:32:22.514]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[02:32:23.334 --> 02:32:23.935]  We're good to go.
[02:32:43.169 --> 02:32:48.512]  We're new for InfoWarsMD, exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[02:32:48.932 --> 02:32:50.192]  Introducing them both, 25% off.
[02:32:50.232 --> 02:32:55.095]  You'll find them exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com, and they fund their operation.
[02:32:59.917 --> 02:33:05.820]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:13.562 --> 02:33:15.343]  You got me, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:15.823 --> 02:33:19.344]  I love you, and I love taking on tyrants.
[02:33:19.584 --> 02:33:26.126]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:26.166 --> 02:33:30.527]  All right, I'm going to give you my take on Elon Musk and Neuralink before the hour ends.
[02:33:31.127 --> 02:33:32.527]  Our reporters are at the border.
[02:33:32.547 --> 02:33:34.948]  They'll be popping into the war room and more in a bunch of this tomorrow.
[02:33:35.368 --> 02:33:40.750]  Follow us at InfoWars.com forward slash show, band.video, and of course, real Alex Jones on X.
[02:33:42.481 --> 02:33:45.402]  All right, let's rampage through your phone calls right now.
[02:33:45.542 --> 02:33:47.402]  Baldy in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:33:47.442 --> 02:33:47.802]  Welcome.
[02:33:49.582 --> 02:33:56.043]  Okay, so when we talk about a pending war in Iran, I think we should remind each other that this is Obama's war.
[02:33:56.944 --> 02:34:04.345]  He funded a right-and-flame fight with $1.7 billion, and who knows what else that's been handed over to them.
[02:34:04.925 --> 02:34:08.666]  So if a nuke does go off in this country, or three nukes,
[02:34:13.694 --> 02:34:16.415]  Explain that, because I 100% agree with you.
[02:34:16.455 --> 02:34:19.216]  There's really three groups of Islamists.
[02:34:19.236 --> 02:34:26.918]  There's supposedly Shiite and Sunni, but within the Sunni, that's the majority group, there's the Muslim Brotherhood that the main Sunni Saudi Arabians don't like.
[02:34:27.258 --> 02:34:33.380]  So you've got the Saudi Arabians, you've got the Iranians, and then you've got the Muslim Brotherhood, and Obama is with the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:34:34.850 --> 02:34:51.244]  If they can't install a vice president that they want, like, say, a Governor Abbott or something, if he ends up putting a Kerry Lake or even a Rand Paul in as vice president, I think Obama will activate whatever sleeper cells he has here.
[02:34:51.624 --> 02:34:58.269]  Last time I called, I mentioned I see a three-nuke attack, and you mentioned that the CIA had war-gamed that out.
[02:34:59.010 --> 02:35:02.152]  I think he's definitely heavily connected with the CIA.
[02:35:03.013 --> 02:35:05.277]  So that would be probably the plan of attack.
[02:35:05.998 --> 02:35:11.748]  However, and I'd like to circle back around to that, but I want to point out, since you started out talking about local radio...
[02:35:12.546 --> 02:35:12.927]  I think?
[02:35:36.187 --> 02:35:45.170]  Not just the effectiveness as a caller as I am, but getting the truth out, which is why they hate us is because of the truth, but because of their response.
[02:35:45.590 --> 02:35:48.791]  If you listen to their response, they had memorized it.
[02:35:48.851 --> 02:35:56.653]  His producer even got on and started saying that people like me were the problem, like I was the virus wanting people to go out and work.
[02:35:57.313 --> 02:36:01.195]  Rochester 2020, if you listen to that call, it'll blow your mind.
[02:36:02.675 --> 02:36:03.655]  Well, send us the call.
[02:36:03.675 --> 02:36:04.175]  We'll put it up.
[02:36:04.236 --> 02:36:05.596]  I think I remember you calling about that.
[02:36:06.770 --> 02:36:09.171]  Sure, and I called you a bunch of times during the pandemic.
[02:36:09.551 --> 02:36:10.892]  There's only two things on there.
[02:36:11.192 --> 02:36:17.834]  You can find me, Mochester2020 on X, or you can find my podcast, Mochester, anywhere where you could hear... Say it slow.
[02:36:17.874 --> 02:36:18.555]  What's your podcast?
[02:36:18.575 --> 02:36:19.415]  Say it slow.
[02:36:19.435 --> 02:36:20.095]  What's the podcast?
[02:36:21.276 --> 02:36:22.196]  Mobchester.
[02:36:22.216 --> 02:36:23.057]  It's a play on words.
[02:36:23.097 --> 02:36:23.857]  Mobchester.
[02:36:24.577 --> 02:36:25.177]  I remember you.
[02:36:25.197 --> 02:36:26.558]  Yeah, you've been dead on, brother.
[02:36:26.598 --> 02:36:28.179]  So I remember you.
[02:36:28.199 --> 02:36:28.779]  You were dead on.
[02:36:28.799 --> 02:36:30.519]  So that's who he went on as guest and caller.
[02:36:30.539 --> 02:36:31.440]  So tell us what's coming next.
[02:36:32.714 --> 02:36:44.497]  So, again, I foresaw Trump and everything, because he was the only one that was going to stand up in these debates, because they steamrolled right over Ron Paul.
[02:36:44.937 --> 02:36:53.039]  But I feel, you know, now, and I wasn't so much for him, but since they're coming out against him, and they cannot stop him now.
[02:36:53.059 --> 02:36:56.180]  Oh, it's obvious they legitimately don't like him anymore.
[02:36:56.320 --> 02:36:57.180]  And let's explain.
[02:36:57.200 --> 02:37:00.781]  The globalists only get more power with a 9-11 or a new attack.
[02:37:21.192 --> 02:37:22.112]  That's the illogic.
[02:37:22.153 --> 02:37:24.214]  We've got to be pointing out they're the ones behind it.
[02:37:24.714 --> 02:37:26.935]  As the FBI director says, he sees all these flashing lights.
[02:37:27.175 --> 02:37:32.198]  His own agents are telling him, military-age men connected to all these foreign governments are coming in.
[02:37:32.578 --> 02:37:33.818]  Something big is planned.
[02:37:34.079 --> 02:37:35.299]  They're not doing this by accident.
[02:37:35.339 --> 02:37:36.220]  Thank you so much, Baldy.
[02:37:37.740 --> 02:37:39.261]  Anthony in Pennsylvania, welcome.
[02:37:40.442 --> 02:37:41.482]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:37:41.522 --> 02:37:43.263]  Long-time listener, first-time caller.
[02:37:43.283 --> 02:37:45.104]  I appreciate your time and your efforts here.
[02:37:45.884 --> 02:37:50.747]  I wanted to just talk about how we are in the information war fight of our lives right now.
[02:37:51.741 --> 02:38:01.389]  We have the lowest retention rate and the worst recruitment numbers in the military since pre-World War I. We are fighting multiple wars on multiple fronts for the sovereignty of this nation.
[02:38:02.009 --> 02:38:03.630]  We're funding a war in Eastern Europe.
[02:38:03.670 --> 02:38:05.092]  We're funding a war in the Middle East.
[02:38:05.152 --> 02:38:13.898]  And right now we're on the brink of retaliatory attacks in Iran, which our own Secretary of State says is the hottest that region has been since 1973.
[02:38:13.938 --> 02:38:15.480]  That's more than the war in Afghanistan.
[02:38:15.780 --> 02:38:17.161]  That's more than the war in Iraq.
[02:38:17.922 --> 02:38:20.043]  We have a CBS News correspondent...
[02:38:21.716 --> 02:38:22.456]  Catherine Herridge.
[02:38:22.777 --> 02:38:25.678]  She says that she believes there's going to be a black swan event in the year 2024.
[02:38:26.078 --> 02:38:34.842]  Now, I hope that I'm wrong, Alex, but am I crazy to think that they're actually trying to start World War III in order to suspend the election?
[02:38:36.422 --> 02:38:34.842]  100%.
[02:38:36.542 --> 02:38:37.523]  Everything's on the table.
[02:38:37.863 --> 02:38:43.726]  The end of the old monetary system, the central bank digital currencies, the ESGs, it's all coming in now.
[02:38:44.186 --> 02:38:49.148]  Everything's aligning now, and they need a global crisis or a group of crises to bring it in.
[02:38:52.099 --> 02:38:52.499]  He dropped.
[02:38:52.519 --> 02:38:52.920]  All right.
[02:38:53.420 --> 02:38:53.981]  Thank you, sir.
[02:38:54.441 --> 02:38:55.282]  Steve in Alabama.
[02:38:55.302 --> 02:38:55.902]  Thanks for calling.
[02:38:55.922 --> 02:38:56.223]  Go ahead.
[02:38:56.243 --> 02:38:58.505]  Did you say Steven?
[02:38:58.865 --> 02:38:59.185]  Yes, sir.
[02:38:59.225 --> 02:38:59.565]  Go ahead.
[02:38:59.585 --> 02:39:04.149]  Hey, first of all, I just want to thank you, Alex, for being a true American patriot.
[02:39:04.350 --> 02:39:05.871]  You will go down in history, my friend.
[02:39:06.491 --> 02:39:13.397]  But second, I want to say two words that very few of us may have ever heard in the same sentence or even conjoined.
[02:39:14.338 --> 02:39:15.499]  American refugee.
[02:39:16.580 --> 02:39:19.863]  If we don't start looking to our community...
[02:39:20.906 --> 02:39:22.947]  The men have been emasculated.
[02:39:24.248 --> 02:39:26.309]  COVID, they pushed isolation.
[02:39:26.349 --> 02:39:28.050]  That way, we wouldn't reach out to each other.
[02:39:28.110 --> 02:39:31.552]  Now, with social media, I did a split test.
[02:39:31.572 --> 02:39:35.814]  I created a right-leaning Instagram profile and a left-leaning.
[02:39:36.535 --> 02:39:40.177]  The right-leaning got zero traction.
[02:39:40.217 --> 02:39:42.898]  The left got pushed like crazy.
[02:39:43.078 --> 02:39:43.159]  It's
[02:39:44.910 --> 02:39:46.631]  It's in everything.
[02:39:46.851 --> 02:39:52.673]  Twitter has been the only space I've been able to find where I can speak my voice and not feel as though I'm being suppressed.
[02:39:52.813 --> 02:39:55.294]  And Adon had to spend $44 million just to do that.
[02:39:56.194 --> 02:39:56.895]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:39:58.115 --> 02:40:00.336]  I mean, I would if I could, but I'm glad he did it.
[02:40:01.076 --> 02:40:12.000]  But yeah, like I was saying, this is my plea to all the veterans out there, the former military, police, everybody that has some common sense.
[02:40:12.060 --> 02:40:13.321]  The people are already here.
[02:40:14.091 --> 02:40:17.013]  And behind the scenes, the globalists are working with the Iranians.
[02:40:44.561 --> 02:40:55.851]  I'm all over the dark web, just searching and looking, but there's stuff all over 4chan about plans and plots and stuff of what they're going to do, like the Browns Ferry that y'all mentioned earlier.
[02:40:56.692 --> 02:41:02.597]  It was on there last month, and I don't know why people would be bringing that up now.
[02:41:03.118 --> 02:41:05.900]  But none of this stuff is coincidence.
[02:41:06.080 --> 02:41:08.262]  Everybody has common sense.
[02:41:08.382 --> 02:41:09.343]  They feel it in their gut.
[02:41:09.623 --> 02:41:11.085]  What you're feeling is true.
[02:41:11.787 --> 02:41:13.349]  Oh, I mean, I can just feel it.
[02:41:13.389 --> 02:41:16.391]  My spidey sense is 50 times what it's ever been.
[02:41:16.411 --> 02:41:17.512]  You can just feel the danger.
[02:41:18.333 --> 02:41:18.733]  Yes, sir.
[02:41:18.974 --> 02:41:20.175]  You're absolutely right.
[02:41:20.195 --> 02:41:21.636]  And again, I just want to thank you.
[02:41:23.626 --> 02:41:24.727]  I want to thank you, Steve.
[02:41:25.047 --> 02:41:27.868]  But what the globalists are masters of is that everybody has this anxiety.
[02:41:27.888 --> 02:41:29.749]  They say, oh, it's white supremacists.
[02:41:29.809 --> 02:41:30.790]  Oh, it's the white people.
[02:41:31.190 --> 02:41:31.930]  Oh, it's the Christians.
[02:41:31.970 --> 02:41:33.031]  That's why we're having anxiety.
[02:41:33.411 --> 02:41:36.292]  No, the inflation, the open borders, the war.
[02:41:36.753 --> 02:41:39.194]  It's the criminals running our country, folks.
[02:41:39.594 --> 02:41:42.515]  Not the black people, not the white people, not the brown people.
[02:41:42.896 --> 02:41:44.516]  They're all playing us off against each other.
[02:41:44.937 --> 02:41:46.517]  Alex in California, you're on the air.
[02:41:46.557 --> 02:41:46.878]  Welcome.
[02:41:48.178 --> 02:41:48.819]  Hey, thank you.
[02:41:48.839 --> 02:41:51.000]  Thank you for being a truth teller and a truth seeker.
[02:41:51.260 --> 02:41:51.600]  I'm trying.
[02:41:52.489 --> 02:41:55.491]  Alex, we are a Christian homeschooled family.
[02:41:55.651 --> 02:41:57.753]  We are packed up in Southern California.
[02:41:57.813 --> 02:41:59.213]  We are out of here tomorrow morning.
[02:41:59.814 --> 02:42:06.318]  We are in a blessed position where we do not have a destination, but we have resources to make it for a fresh new start for our children.
[02:42:06.338 --> 02:42:08.760]  We want to raise them to be young men.
[02:42:09.780 --> 02:42:16.665]  Which region of the United States would you suggest, based on your expertise, that's going to be successful raising them?
[02:42:16.885 --> 02:42:21.128]  And also, do you suggest rural living or city living?
[02:42:21.148 --> 02:42:21.408]  Okay.
[02:42:21.889 --> 02:42:24.030]  You know, that's got to be your own personal decision.
[02:42:24.050 --> 02:42:26.832]  I don't know what your skills are, what you're able to do.
[02:42:26.892 --> 02:42:27.752]  Are you a mechanic?
[02:42:27.792 --> 02:42:28.612]  Are you a farmer?
[02:42:28.632 --> 02:42:29.433]  Are you a doctor?
[02:42:29.453 --> 02:42:30.974]  Are you a school teacher?
[02:42:30.994 --> 02:42:32.334]  Are you a banker?
[02:42:32.594 --> 02:42:33.735]  Are you a plumber?
[02:42:34.736 --> 02:42:37.537]  But you can look at the biggest boom cities, the biggest boom towns.
[02:42:38.577 --> 02:42:40.038]  A lot of those are all let us run to.
[02:42:40.078 --> 02:42:42.299]  It's not like places outside California are much better.
[02:42:42.319 --> 02:42:43.460]  They're just a little bit better.
[02:42:43.920 --> 02:42:46.862]  But if I had my brothers, I would be in a...
[02:42:47.822 --> 02:42:53.704]  Southern small Christian town because they're the most insulated from what's going on.
[02:42:54.565 --> 02:42:56.906]  And that might mean West Texas.
[02:42:57.406 --> 02:42:58.386]  There's hardly any jobs there.
[02:42:58.406 --> 02:42:59.167]  There's good people there.
[02:42:59.547 --> 02:43:01.207]  Or East Texas in the middle of nowhere.
[02:43:01.848 --> 02:43:03.168]  That's a complex question.
[02:43:03.228 --> 02:43:05.249]  It really comes down to what your skills are.
[02:43:05.309 --> 02:43:07.870]  But, yeah, good choice to get the hell out of California.
[02:43:08.490 --> 02:43:12.092]  So I can't sit there and war game that for you not knowing your particulars.
[02:43:13.126 --> 02:43:14.227]  Okay, I do appreciate it.
[02:43:14.247 --> 02:43:16.768]  Now, I just found out about the Jesuits.
[02:43:17.028 --> 02:43:26.434]  We're still new to all of this new information, and we've noticed that during Roosevelt, they were able to suspend the Constitution, and he actually had four terms.
[02:43:27.355 --> 02:43:29.536]  Is the Constitution currently suspended?
[02:43:29.556 --> 02:43:31.577]  If it is, how do we unsuspend it?
[02:43:31.898 --> 02:43:37.161]  Yes, I mean, that gets all into legalese, because everything's forced to sure, or the unstoppable force, but...
[02:43:39.775 --> 02:43:47.239]  They declare a new emergency every year, and we're operating under emergency rules since World War II, and the Jesuits are the Society of Jesus.
[02:43:47.799 --> 02:43:49.820]  They're one of the biggest leftist New World Order groups.
[02:43:49.860 --> 02:43:50.841]  The Pope's a Jesuit.
[02:43:51.121 --> 02:43:55.684]  It's not that Catholics are bad, but it's like every institution's been taken over.
[02:43:56.504 --> 02:44:04.368]  And so, yes, the Jesuits are supposedly set up by Loyola, this defender of the Catholic Church, but it became really the thing to take it over.
[02:44:04.388 --> 02:44:06.189]  It's like a coup within the Catholic Church.
[02:44:07.610 --> 02:44:08.651]  But tying that into...
[02:44:09.531 --> 02:44:10.672]  The other stuff you were talking about.
[02:44:10.692 --> 02:44:14.053]  I mean, it's all... I wouldn't say the Jesuits run it.
[02:44:14.093 --> 02:44:18.595]  There's evil groups all over the place that the globalists control.
[02:44:18.655 --> 02:44:20.216]  The globalists are controlled by Satan.
[02:44:21.816 --> 02:44:22.116]  Amen.
[02:44:22.376 --> 02:44:22.677]  Amen.
[02:44:22.757 --> 02:44:23.997]  Well, thank you for your advice.
[02:44:24.097 --> 02:44:28.839]  Now that we are going to get out of California and get some extra money, we're going to go and buy some product.
[02:44:28.879 --> 02:44:30.360]  That's what's held us back this whole time.
[02:44:31.192 --> 02:44:34.815]  Well, brother, just take care of your children and let them know that it's not monetary things that matter.
[02:44:34.855 --> 02:44:36.357]  It's a spiritual relationship.
[02:44:36.797 --> 02:44:42.483]  It wouldn't matter if your family lives in a small town and your wife works at a Walgreens and you work at a gas station.
[02:44:42.903 --> 02:44:48.048]  As long as your children aren't being taught by a bunch of pedophiles and brainwashed, that's what matters.
[02:44:48.068 --> 02:44:49.990]  It's not about the monetary success.
[02:44:50.350 --> 02:44:54.454]  It's about the independence and having a garden and having a good church you can go to.
[02:44:54.474 --> 02:44:56.055]  There's a lot of small churches out there.
[02:44:56.656 --> 02:44:58.217]  The big ones are all just feel-good things.
[02:44:58.257 --> 02:44:59.418]  They're not that bad on average.
[02:44:59.438 --> 02:45:00.158]  They're just feel-good.
[02:45:00.178 --> 02:45:00.779]  All right.
[02:45:00.799 --> 02:45:01.219]  Thank you, sir.
[02:45:01.979 --> 02:45:02.300]  All right.
[02:45:02.340 --> 02:45:06.943]  Let's talk to Dorlita in Oklahoma.
[02:45:06.963 --> 02:45:07.543]  Thanks for calling.
[02:45:08.904 --> 02:45:09.164]  Hey, Alex.
[02:45:09.244 --> 02:45:11.165]  I just want to make a quick point.
[02:45:12.446 --> 02:45:17.630]  I know it kind of makes me nervous because we've got our government that is desperate.
[02:45:17.790 --> 02:45:21.172]  We've got China, Iran, Russia desperate.
[02:45:21.772 --> 02:45:22.112]  Okay?
[02:45:22.573 --> 02:45:25.975]  So we're living up here by a refinery.
[02:45:26.860 --> 02:45:28.781]  Well, we know the left is running around cutting off infrastructure everywhere.
[02:45:49.665 --> 02:45:53.688]  And so they can claim a foreign power did it, but who's already done it?
[02:45:53.949 --> 02:45:55.290]  Who's already cut off the pipelines?
[02:45:55.610 --> 02:45:57.632]  Who's already been caught getting rid of all the different permits?
[02:45:57.932 --> 02:46:00.934]  And it's the left who want to bring us to our knees.
[02:46:02.536 --> 02:46:04.037]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:46:04.237 --> 02:46:11.022]  We're starting to see, like, unfamiliar faces, people that's not been around here, but it's not like family, family.
[02:46:11.042 --> 02:46:16.267]  I mean, even if you have, like, Mexicans moving in, like, brothers and brothers, you see them interacting with each other.
[02:46:16.287 --> 02:46:19.129]  These are grown men, military age,
[02:46:20.036 --> 02:46:21.257]  They don't come out very often.
[02:46:21.297 --> 02:46:23.319]  Sometimes they do with their backpacks and they just roam around.
[02:46:23.339 --> 02:46:27.202]  We're being totally set up for destruction.
[02:46:27.242 --> 02:46:28.303]  I think you're absolutely right.
[02:46:29.124 --> 02:46:29.364]  Right.
[02:46:29.424 --> 02:46:32.226]  And the thing is, I got these little job alerts on my phone.
[02:46:33.187 --> 02:46:38.411]  And it was pinging like crazy for two weeks straight about FEMA positions opening up in K County.
[02:46:39.873 --> 02:46:42.595]  And I thought, why all of a sudden are they just pinging it all of a sudden?
[02:46:44.073 --> 02:46:46.114]  Well, ma'am, we're in an emergency economy.
[02:46:46.154 --> 02:46:47.314]  We're in a takeover economy.
[02:46:47.374 --> 02:46:48.115]  I appreciate your call.
[02:46:48.135 --> 02:46:53.136]  All right, since you mentioned that, let me show you an article out of Town Hall.
[02:46:54.917 --> 02:47:09.503]  Biden, for the first two and a half years, killed all the major oil drilling permits, all the gas drilling permits, ordered thousands of sub-pipeline shutdown, ordered the major Keystone pipeline shutdown, first day in office when he stole the election in 2021.
[02:47:12.202 --> 02:47:32.271]  And then, because Texas is fighting him on the border, he claims, he just killed the permits for the number one natural gas producing country in the world, and Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi were the biggest producers of it, that we can't sell liquefied natural gas.
[02:47:36.288 --> 02:47:37.609]  Remember what he did just six months ago?
[02:47:37.949 --> 02:47:43.593]  He asked Venezuela to up its oil production so he wouldn't have production here that helps the people.
[02:47:44.093 --> 02:47:45.734]  So we just buy it from them.
[02:47:46.835 --> 02:47:47.836]  Everything is against America.
[02:47:47.856 --> 02:47:48.356]  Well, here it is.
[02:47:48.896 --> 02:47:56.421]  Land Commissioner says Biden stopped approval of LNG exports, liquid natural gas, in retaliation of Texas defiance.
[02:47:57.422 --> 02:48:02.806]  The Texas Land Commissioner is accusing President Joe Biden of deliberately ending the approval of liquid natural gas exports.
[02:48:04.161 --> 02:48:17.943]  Don Beckingham believes the Biden administration is playing political games with Texas after the state took a bold stand in defending our border against foreign invaders and last week killed all export out of the state of Texas, the main exporter in the world.
[02:48:19.264 --> 02:48:22.224]  So Biden already blew up the Russian Nord Stream pipeline.
[02:48:24.385 --> 02:48:27.705]  He already cut off the Keystone pipeline for oil out of Canada and the Midwest.
[02:48:28.245 --> 02:48:31.506]  Now they're killing all exports of liquid natural gas.
[02:48:33.149 --> 02:48:38.412]  A sanction against America and America workers to bring you to your knees.
[02:48:38.872 --> 02:48:40.453]  And people say, why do I care about natural gas?
[02:48:41.334 --> 02:48:43.995]  That's the second biggest power supply we've got.
[02:48:44.315 --> 02:48:45.956]  And it's one of the biggest exports we've got.
[02:48:46.296 --> 02:48:52.260]  I mean, a fleet of a thousand bombers couldn't do this much damage, dropping conventional bombs.
[02:48:52.720 --> 02:48:55.141]  They are literally an economic war with us.
[02:48:55.682 --> 02:48:57.302]  Jefferson in Virginia, you're on the air.
[02:48:57.362 --> 02:48:57.743]  Go ahead.
[02:49:00.084 --> 02:49:00.504]  Hey, Alex.
[02:49:00.524 --> 02:49:01.064]  Good to talk to you.
[02:49:01.084 --> 02:49:01.805]  Good to talk to you.
[02:49:04.119 --> 02:49:06.840]  I know you enjoy talking to Viva Fry from Viva Barnes.
[02:49:08.821 --> 02:49:25.326]  I would love to have you review episode 169 of Viva Barnes, starting at the 20-minute mark, where Viva, the Canadian, is asking Barnes all the correct questions about who's eligible to be president here in the United States, and Barnes gets almost every answer wrong.
[02:49:26.351 --> 02:49:39.261]  So this is the Achilles heel of the Biden administration, that right now we have a Jamaican citizen at birth who is getting to be our vice president because we don't understand what the definition of natural-born citizenship is.
[02:49:39.721 --> 02:49:41.022]  It's not being born here.
[02:49:41.623 --> 02:49:43.144]  It's not being a citizen at birth.
[02:49:43.705 --> 02:49:48.208]  It is having two USA citizen parents as your parents at the time of your birth.
[02:49:48.648 --> 02:49:50.750]  That's the definition of a natural-born citizen.
[02:49:51.250 --> 02:49:54.613]  You had Paul calling on January 2nd and explaining this statement.
[02:49:55.237 --> 02:49:55.898]  We're good to go.
[02:49:55.918 --> 02:49:56.158]  I think?
[02:50:17.296 --> 02:50:17.836]  We're good to go.
[02:50:17.856 --> 02:50:18.336]  We're good to go.
[02:50:48.720 --> 02:50:55.101]  Right, but even before the 14th Amendment was passed, almost nobody got to be confused with a citizen if they were merely born here.
[02:50:55.261 --> 02:50:57.382]  Everybody said, well, wait a minute, who are your parents?
[02:50:57.502 --> 02:50:58.742]  No, you don't get to be a citizen here.
[02:50:58.962 --> 02:51:09.384]  It wasn't until the 14th Amendment was codified that we all started to believe that birthplace was more important than who your parents were and whether they were citizens at the time of your birth.
[02:51:09.644 --> 02:51:11.304]  So I love Vivek Ramaswamy.
[02:51:11.564 --> 02:51:12.244]  I think he's great.
[02:51:13.004 --> 02:51:15.605]  But neither of his parents were citizens at the time of his birth.
[02:51:16.065 --> 02:51:20.186]  So he needs to go about amending Article 2, so he's... No, I hear you.
[02:51:20.606 --> 02:51:22.146]  I hear you, and I think that's a good point.
[02:51:22.186 --> 02:51:23.527]  I think you're right, and I appreciate your call.
[02:51:24.147 --> 02:51:26.207]  All right, let's go to Gail in Illinois.
[02:51:26.227 --> 02:51:26.707]  You're on the air.
[02:51:26.927 --> 02:51:27.227]  Welcome.
[02:51:28.228 --> 02:51:29.868]  Well, hello there, Alex.
[02:51:30.208 --> 02:51:33.949]  I'm glad to be on, and I might be all over the place.
[02:51:34.009 --> 02:51:34.769]  Oh, I appreciate it.
[02:51:34.789 --> 02:51:35.429]  Go ahead.
[02:51:36.389 --> 02:51:37.370]  Okay.
[02:51:38.090 --> 02:51:41.670]  So, yes, I do live in Illinois, even though it's a blue state.
[02:51:41.750 --> 02:51:42.711]  However, Chicago's also here, so...
[02:51:45.040 --> 02:51:46.261]  That's why we're a blue state.
[02:51:46.281 --> 02:51:55.608]  However, I think it's important to... Sorry, I'm nervous.
[02:51:56.809 --> 02:52:01.713]  I think it's important to understand what the U.N.
[02:52:01.773 --> 02:52:06.697]  summit did back in September, the end of September when they had the U.N.
[02:52:06.737 --> 02:52:12.862]  summit with every 193 nations, every nation signed the SGD...
[02:52:13.752 --> 02:52:21.376]  The development goals for Agenda 2030 to accelerate their agenda for seven years.
[02:52:21.416 --> 02:52:24.098]  And their goal is to finish everything by 2030.
[02:52:26.839 --> 02:52:28.360]  And that was the end of September.
[02:52:30.822 --> 02:52:31.462]  I watched it.
[02:52:31.522 --> 02:52:36.125]  They had Ukraine Zelensky there.
[02:52:36.325 --> 02:52:38.906]  They had everybody there.
[02:52:38.986 --> 02:52:40.147]  I want to go there.
[02:52:40.578 --> 02:52:41.058]  We're good to go.
[02:53:03.786 --> 02:53:04.426]  We're good to go.
[02:53:04.446 --> 02:53:04.586]  I think?
[02:53:19.763 --> 02:53:20.944]  No, I mean, I'm glad you called.
[02:53:21.084 --> 02:53:23.245]  We've covered this a lot, but it's always important to cover it again.
[02:53:23.305 --> 02:53:25.626]  I wrote the book, The Great Reset, The War for the World.
[02:53:25.666 --> 02:53:27.726]  I wrote The Great Awakening.
[02:53:28.367 --> 02:53:29.647]  No, it's a global government plan.
[02:53:30.047 --> 02:53:32.868]  That's what I told Vivek Ramaswamy earlier.
[02:53:32.928 --> 02:53:34.849]  I said, we need to attack this.
[02:53:34.869 --> 02:53:37.110]  He agreed with me.
[02:53:38.831 --> 02:53:46.774]  I mean, I just think that it's important to, you know, not only focus on what's going on with our border, to what's going on with Iran.
[02:53:47.154 --> 02:53:48.415]  It's almost like I feel like...
[02:53:49.833 --> 02:53:51.514]  You know, it's just their turn.
[02:53:52.095 --> 02:53:55.917]  And they're going to be moving after the Middle East is destroyed.
[02:53:55.937 --> 02:53:59.960]  They're going to move to another country and destroy that.
[02:54:00.120 --> 02:54:01.061]  No, I hear you.
[02:54:01.081 --> 02:54:01.862]  It's a global government.
[02:54:01.882 --> 02:54:02.422]  We're up against it.
[02:54:02.442 --> 02:54:03.503]  I'm glad you're on top of it.
[02:54:03.863 --> 02:54:04.604]  Thank you, Gail.
[02:54:05.084 --> 02:54:07.145]  All right, Bert in FEMA Region 9.
[02:54:07.305 --> 02:54:08.426]  I guess that's on the West Coast.
[02:54:08.446 --> 02:54:08.806]  Go ahead.
[02:54:10.127 --> 02:54:13.710]  A coup is coming, and they're going to kill Biden.
[02:54:15.111 --> 02:54:19.234]  And the trigger event for all of this will be a nuclear 9-11 false flag event.
[02:54:20.347 --> 02:54:22.549]  And after that is when the wars begin.
[02:54:23.750 --> 02:54:25.191]  But it won't be World War III.
[02:54:26.892 --> 02:54:28.033]  Can I skip to the election?
[02:54:30.435 --> 02:54:32.997]  Trump will not be assassinated.
[02:54:34.178 --> 02:54:37.601]  But he will be disqualified at the last minute.
[02:54:38.402 --> 02:54:39.262]  Shall I tell you how?
[02:54:39.282 --> 02:54:43.126]  It will be done on term limits.
[02:54:44.066 --> 02:54:45.648]  He's already been elected twice.
[02:54:46.728 --> 02:54:47.329]  And as soon as
[02:54:48.357 --> 02:54:58.766]  As a lawsuit decides that there was election fraud, it will be decided that he won two terms, that we did not fulfill his second term.
[02:54:59.987 --> 02:55:03.570]  But it won't matter, because there won't be an election.
[02:55:05.892 --> 02:55:09.295]  All of this is explained in detail at Nuclear911.com in a one-hour video.
[02:55:16.287 --> 02:55:16.627]  You're on air.
[02:55:16.647 --> 02:55:20.850]  Go ahead.
[02:55:21.410 --> 02:55:31.015]  The idea that there won't be World War III is that the threat of World War III is more important than such a war.
[02:55:32.616 --> 02:55:34.717]  Well, sure, a world war doesn't mean nuclear.
[02:55:34.757 --> 02:55:37.158]  A world war means it's in a whole bunch of different regions.
[02:55:37.198 --> 02:55:41.121]  I think we're already in a global war, but I appreciate your call.
[02:55:41.141 --> 02:55:41.601]  Great points.
[02:55:42.161 --> 02:55:45.223]  All right, I said I'd hit Elon Musk, and we're going to do it.
[02:55:46.400 --> 02:55:47.961]  And his whole Neuralink announcement.
[02:55:47.981 --> 02:55:51.503]  So we're going to go to break, and we're going to come back, and we're going to hit that.
[02:55:51.623 --> 02:56:02.210]  And then Maria Z has a very special guest joining her, heading up one of the big convoys.
[02:56:03.234 --> 02:56:03.454]  I think?
[02:56:18.234 --> 02:56:22.275]  And it's great that we're reaching a million today on X, but we can't just operate on that and hope that's going to be there.
[02:56:22.675 --> 02:56:23.915]  Got to remember to share the links.

[03:00:08.689 --> 03:00:10.210]  The dollar buys a nickel's worth.
[03:00:10.691 --> 03:00:11.691]  Banks are going bust.
[03:00:11.771 --> 03:00:13.733]  Shopkeepers keep a gun under their coat.
[03:00:14.333 --> 03:00:15.915]  Punks are running wild in the street.
[03:00:15.975 --> 03:00:18.517]  There's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do and there's no end to it.
[03:00:20.131 --> 03:00:20.551]  We know.
[03:00:20.991 --> 03:00:24.213]  The air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat.
[03:00:24.953 --> 03:00:33.476]  We sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes as if that's the way it's supposed to be.
[03:00:33.736 --> 03:00:35.797]  We know things are bad, worse than bad.
[03:00:36.417 --> 03:00:37.117]  They're crazy.
[03:00:37.337 --> 03:00:40.378]  It's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out anymore.
[03:00:40.758 --> 03:00:47.659]  We sit in the house, and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller, and all we say is, please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms.
[03:00:47.699 --> 03:00:52.060]  Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radios, and I won't say anything.
[03:00:52.260 --> 03:00:53.100]  Just leave us alone.
[03:00:53.340 --> 03:00:54.720]  Well, I'm not going to leave you alone.
[03:00:55.581 --> 03:00:56.721]  I want you to get mad.
[03:00:59.201 --> 03:01:00.481]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:01:01.482 --> 03:01:03.102]  The Internet will never be the same.
[03:01:04.128 --> 03:01:07.454]  I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!
[03:01:18.411 --> 03:01:22.274]  The Whopper spends all its time thinking about World War III.
[03:01:22.734 --> 03:01:24.195]  Target selection complete.
[03:01:24.235 --> 03:01:26.096]  Time on target sequence complete.
[03:01:26.116 --> 03:01:31.780]  22 Typhoon-class submarines departing Petropavlovsk, turning southbound at North Cap.
[03:01:32.060 --> 03:01:33.021]  Bearing 095 degrees.
[03:01:33.281 --> 03:01:38.685]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan Air Defense Zone.
[03:01:39.165 --> 03:01:45.510]  From the front lines of the Information War... Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode.
[03:01:45.570 --> 03:01:46.951]  We are at DEFCON 1.
[03:01:49.352 --> 03:01:51.674]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[03:01:51.814 --> 03:01:52.674]  You betcha!
[03:01:52.754 --> 03:01:56.917]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:01:57.077 --> 03:02:00.039]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[03:02:00.740 --> 03:02:03.802]  Three, two, one.
[03:02:04.763 --> 03:02:05.143]  Impact.
[03:02:05.483 --> 03:02:07.384]  Shall we play a game?
[03:02:07.604 --> 03:02:09.626]  How about Roblox?
[03:02:13.470 --> 03:02:18.118]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:02:18.319 --> 03:02:20.342]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready.
[03:02:20.623 --> 03:02:21.444]  Awaiting launch codes.
[03:02:22.206 --> 03:02:23.408]  We are in launch mode.
[03:02:23.829 --> 03:02:24.650]  Do you really?
[03:02:27.729 --> 03:02:31.692]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:02:32.112 --> 03:02:33.473]  We're in.
[03:02:33.613 --> 03:02:34.995]  Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[03:02:35.395 --> 03:02:37.897]  We have Soviet submarine launch detection.
[03:02:37.917 --> 03:02:39.618]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[03:02:39.978 --> 03:02:41.439]  I wish I was like everybody else.
[03:02:42.080 --> 03:02:46.143]  And then, the only winning goal is not to.
[03:02:48.234 --> 03:02:53.477]  If you think gun control or something like that is going to change a terrorist's point of view, I think you're, like, out of your mind.
[03:02:54.277 --> 03:02:57.079]  You may think you've got me worried about what you're going to do.
[03:02:57.099 --> 03:02:59.861]  Dude, you're about to find out what I'm going to do.
[03:02:59.921 --> 03:03:01.842]  And that's going to worry you a lot more.
[03:03:01.902 --> 03:03:05.064]  Law dog, you don't step aside, we'll tear you apart.
[03:03:07.165 --> 03:03:08.205]  You die first, get it?
[03:03:09.486 --> 03:03:13.648]  Your friends might get me in a rush, but not before I make your head into a canoe, you understand me?
[03:03:14.729 --> 03:03:15.910]  He's bluffing, let's rush him.
[03:03:16.010 --> 03:03:16.110]  No!
[03:03:17.588 --> 03:03:19.870]  You're not as stupid as you look.
[03:03:19.990 --> 03:03:24.435]  Yeah, I don't understand the concepts of conversation of the gun culture.
[03:03:24.895 --> 03:03:29.119]  We've lived with guns since, what, the 7th century or something?
[03:03:29.180 --> 03:03:30.080]  I don't know.
[03:03:30.100 --> 03:03:31.202]  You can say what you want.
[03:03:31.222 --> 03:03:32.483]  I don't agree with that.
[03:03:32.503 --> 03:03:35.105]  There's a big difference between fantasy land...
[03:03:40.971 --> 03:03:42.951]  In reality, Fantasyland is what we do.
[03:03:42.992 --> 03:03:45.952]  Doing a movie, doing a television show, that's Fantasyland.
[03:03:46.092 --> 03:03:47.472]  And that's where that stuff belongs.
[03:03:47.593 --> 03:03:54.674]  In reality, when we're dealing with things like terrorism and whatnot, we're all going to have different opinions on how to do it, how to deal with it.
[03:03:54.814 --> 03:04:02.696]  Mine happens to be that I think there's a very strong reason Founding Fathers had for the Second Amendment, and that is that no government ever...
[03:04:03.416 --> 03:04:07.837]  Hasn't had to fight its own people, and its own people hasn't had to fight its own government.
[03:04:07.857 --> 03:04:08.578]  So what are you going to do?
[03:04:08.978 --> 03:04:09.538]  Outlaw everything?
[03:04:09.838 --> 03:04:11.599]  That isn't the answer.
[03:04:11.739 --> 03:04:14.319]  Just put some controls.
[03:04:14.580 --> 03:04:15.440]  Put some controls?
[03:04:15.460 --> 03:04:18.761]  What, so the people who want to defend themselves can't?
[03:04:19.101 --> 03:04:20.281]  No, not so you can't.
[03:04:20.321 --> 03:04:22.182]  Just so the idiots can't get a hold of us.
[03:04:22.202 --> 03:04:24.043]  Do you really believe they're not going to?
[03:04:24.163 --> 03:04:25.203]  Are you serious about that?
[03:04:25.823 --> 03:04:26.624]  Are you serious?
[03:04:27.065 --> 03:04:28.346]  What good will that do?
[03:04:28.466 --> 03:04:30.168]  Oh, my God.
[03:04:30.628 --> 03:04:31.790]  We had our Civil War.
[03:04:32.170 --> 03:04:40.939]  If that Second Amendment hadn't been there, those people would not have had the opportunity to do what they considered was defending their life, their way, their style of living.
[03:04:41.580 --> 03:04:43.442]  So I agree with that.
[03:04:43.522 --> 03:04:47.106]  I think that's an important part of our existence, and it's basically that simple.
[03:04:50.963 --> 03:04:55.385]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:04:58.426 --> 03:05:03.889]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[03:05:04.649 --> 03:05:08.931]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[03:05:09.331 --> 03:05:13.693]  We finally have a limited run back in supply at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:05:15.133 --> 03:05:17.916]  So many people have serious issues.
[03:05:18.176 --> 03:05:19.297]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[03:05:19.758 --> 03:05:25.162]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[03:05:25.703 --> 03:05:31.107]  Most of their iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[03:05:31.728 --> 03:05:35.111]  But this is pure atomic certified iodine.
[03:05:37.315 --> 03:05:40.397]  X2 is now back in stock, discounted.
[03:05:40.718 --> 03:05:43.900]  So I'm giving Thanksgiving right now for this product being here.
[03:05:44.240 --> 03:05:49.344]  It funds the InfoWar, but I guarantee you, you take this for a few weeks, you will feel the difference.
[03:05:49.525 --> 03:05:50.305]  It is amazing.
[03:05:50.645 --> 03:05:54.669]  It's the missing link, X2, back in stock at the end of 2023 at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:05:54.689 --> 03:05:54.709]  X2.
[03:06:02.003 --> 03:06:05.886]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:06:06.006 --> 03:06:13.973]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:14.113 --> 03:06:22.679]  All right, Maria Z is about to be joined by the great Doc Chambers, former Green Beret commander, helping lead one of the big convoys to the Texas border.
[03:06:22.720 --> 03:06:25.602]  Coming up in a few minutes, we'll skip both network breaks until she gets her time back.
[03:06:27.836 --> 03:06:40.492]  I've had a lot of listeners, and when I say a lot, at grocery stores, at church, on the street, at a gas station ask me, I really like Elon Musk, but I'm really concerned about Neuralink and brain chips, and so are we.
[03:06:41.212 --> 03:06:43.836]  The Pentagon and a lot of other organizations like MIT
[03:06:45.057 --> 03:06:48.119]  The Communist Chinese are way advanced in this.
[03:06:48.259 --> 03:06:49.380]  And I've studied Elon Musk.
[03:06:49.920 --> 03:06:59.287]  Anything he sees as a big trend and a big technological development, whether it's a private space program, or whether it's electric cars, or whether it's censorship of the Internet...
[03:07:00.421 --> 03:07:01.342]  So let me start here.
[03:07:18.908 --> 03:07:19.368]  We're good to go.
[03:07:42.549 --> 03:07:43.270]  I love science.
[03:07:43.370 --> 03:07:44.250]  I love technology.
[03:07:44.410 --> 03:07:45.591]  It's a double-edged sword.
[03:07:46.092 --> 03:07:47.973]  It's a two-sided coin.
[03:07:48.553 --> 03:08:05.166]  And my uncle, my dad's brother, great guy, was in a motorcycle accident many years ago and was wracked with pain and so many problems and so many issues because he was having huge problems
[03:08:06.300 --> 03:08:07.080]  We're good to go.
[03:08:07.140 --> 03:08:07.540]  We're good to go.
[03:08:31.348 --> 03:08:43.019]  And it's saying for people that are paralyzed from the neck down or from the stomach down or people that are blind, they're able to go in and put a chip in the brain and put wires in.
[03:08:43.680 --> 03:08:46.342]  It's not even that invasive and they're able to see again.
[03:08:46.382 --> 03:08:47.603]  They're able to walk again.
[03:08:48.024 --> 03:08:48.864]  There was a lot of...
[03:08:50.032 --> 03:08:56.335]  FDA pushback against this, even though the government's been quietly setting all this up with their own systems.
[03:08:56.396 --> 03:08:59.577]  And Microsoft and IBM are doing it secretly.
[03:08:59.617 --> 03:09:00.758]  They admit they have the projects.
[03:09:01.458 --> 03:09:06.101]  So I am not against... If I'm in a car wreck and break my back...
[03:09:07.239 --> 03:09:07.639]  We're good to go.
[03:09:34.980 --> 03:09:35.460]  We're good to go.
[03:09:57.338 --> 03:10:01.979]  Flight's an amazing thing, but then you get intercontinental ballistic missiles.
[03:10:02.079 --> 03:10:07.360]  And that's a public discussion we've got to have and a debate we've got to have.
[03:10:07.380 --> 03:10:22.464]  Elon Musk trying to standardize like Henry Ford and roll out for the general public people with all sorts of neurological disorders, people that have epilepsy, people that are paralyzed.
[03:10:24.065 --> 03:10:29.848]  I'm 50 years old in just a couple weeks and I'm sure as I get older in life I want to have access to things.
[03:10:30.069 --> 03:10:33.451]  Let's say I develop, knock on wood, hope it doesn't happen, Parkinson's.
[03:10:34.051 --> 03:10:36.452]  They've got chips already that basically end it.
[03:10:37.873 --> 03:10:47.159]  So if Elon Musk can test it out with volunteers, bring it forward, and it's adopted for people that are handicapped, people that are special needs, people that need it,
[03:10:48.072 --> 03:10:49.133]  Then it's an amazing thing.
[03:10:49.713 --> 03:10:54.577]  If they could grow an artificial leg for a person to have their leg blown off in war, and it worked, great, grow it.
[03:10:55.158 --> 03:10:56.659]  Just don't do it off fetal parts.
[03:10:57.219 --> 03:10:58.460]  Don't do it off dead people.
[03:10:58.920 --> 03:11:03.084]  Don't do it immorally from, quote, immortal cell lines.
[03:11:04.298 --> 03:11:05.499]  So here's some of the headlines.
[03:11:05.919 --> 03:11:06.319]  Breaking.
[03:11:06.399 --> 03:11:11.923]  Elon Musk reveals first human has received Neuralink implant and is recovering well.
[03:11:12.423 --> 03:11:18.487]  Reportedly a person paralyzed from the neck down that can now, with their brain, control a computer screen.
[03:11:19.372 --> 03:11:27.558]  And in the future, controller robotic suit, they'll be able to get into, hey, I'm all for getting rid of horses and having tractors.
[03:11:28.039 --> 03:11:28.839]  It's the same thing.
[03:11:29.180 --> 03:11:32.582]  The question is, will this empower us or will this enslave us?
[03:11:32.622 --> 03:11:33.963]  I'm not scared of technology.
[03:11:34.724 --> 03:11:35.985]  And I'm not scared of innovation.
[03:11:37.048 --> 03:11:42.171]  But I am really concerned about them trying to force us into this metaverse of total control.
[03:11:42.751 --> 03:11:50.176]  Elon Musk put on X Today, the first human received an implant from at Neuralink yesterday and is recovering well.
[03:11:50.216 --> 03:11:54.398]  Initial results show promising neuron spike detection.
[03:11:55.138 --> 03:11:56.959]  And again, they've already tested all this out.
[03:11:57.320 --> 03:12:01.782]  They can plug a chip into your optic nerve and you don't just see the limited light band you see.
[03:12:01.842 --> 03:12:02.843]  You see everything.
[03:12:03.951 --> 03:12:04.351]  We're good to go.
[03:12:04.371 --> 03:12:04.752]  We're good to go.
[03:12:04.792 --> 03:12:05.292]  We're good to go.
[03:12:34.791 --> 03:12:35.251]  We're good to go.
[03:12:56.678 --> 03:12:57.919]  And major focus on this.
[03:12:58.280 --> 03:13:11.211]  And I've seen the globalists go after Elon Musk and Neuralink because he's popularizing it, while Microsoft and IBM and all the other big institutions like MIT are super far ahead on all of this.
[03:13:11.591 --> 03:13:12.512]  This is where we are.
[03:13:12.572 --> 03:13:13.693]  We're made in the image of God.
[03:13:14.034 --> 03:13:17.216]  What we envision, what we imagine, we're able to do.
[03:13:18.217 --> 03:13:19.679]  So this is a lot bigger than Elon Musk.
[03:13:19.699 --> 03:13:23.162]  But this is my report on Elon Musk and my message to Elon Musk is that
[03:13:24.605 --> 03:13:25.105]  We're good to go.
[03:13:43.342 --> 03:13:48.486]  And that's where I stand, and that's what I believe, and that's what I think is fair and balanced in this discussion.
[03:13:48.526 --> 03:14:00.437]  But we should all become super informed on brain chips and neural links and similar systems so we're not just ignorantly accepting whatever the system passes down to us like Promethean fire.
[03:14:00.977 --> 03:14:03.239]  That's my report on this important subject.
[03:14:03.279 --> 03:14:07.082]  Now Maria Z takes over on what's happening at the Texas border and more.
[03:14:07.322 --> 03:14:07.683]  Maria Z.
[03:14:09.437 --> 03:14:10.798]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[03:14:10.899 --> 03:14:12.580]  It's great to be here with you all.
[03:14:12.620 --> 03:14:15.443]  We've got Doc Pete Chambers joining us in just one moment.
[03:14:15.803 --> 03:14:22.670]  And later on in the broadcast, right before we finish, I have some huge news about the World Health Organization, which is relevant.
[03:14:23.091 --> 03:14:28.216]  It's relevant to what's happening at the Texas border because of the UN replacement migration agenda.
[03:14:28.616 --> 03:14:42.540]  What the WHO is trying to do with worldwide medical tyranny, it is all linked and it is about stripping a nation's sovereignty from it, turning you into a one-world citizen under the one-world government model.
[03:14:42.580 --> 03:14:44.621]  They want to destroy patriotism.
[03:14:44.901 --> 03:14:52.163]  They want to trample all over the US Constitution and that is exactly why this convoy is happening.
[03:14:52.183 --> 03:14:54.564]  Dr. Pete Chambers, thank you so much for joining us today.
[03:14:56.492 --> 03:14:57.599]  How are you, Maria Z?
[03:14:57.740 --> 03:14:59.230]  How's things across the pond?
[03:15:01.306 --> 03:15:02.186]  Doing well, thank you.
[03:15:02.226 --> 03:15:02.687]  Doing well.
[03:15:02.727 --> 03:15:04.568]  Well, we have a lot to talk about today.
[03:15:04.648 --> 03:15:10.973]  I know you have a lot of updates for everyone in terms of, you know, the mainstream media has come after you.
[03:15:11.013 --> 03:15:12.995]  We want to clarify a couple of things here.
[03:15:13.295 --> 03:15:24.883]  We also want to address the people that have concerns about the event and the number of people that are joining that are well-meaning Americans that are simply wanting to protect their Constitution.
[03:15:24.943 --> 03:15:26.525]  So let's start.
[03:15:26.785 --> 03:15:28.446]  Well, you take it away.
[03:15:28.506 --> 03:15:29.547]  You start where you want.
[03:15:31.949 --> 03:15:33.570]  Well, I'm just going to go with the truth.
[03:15:33.630 --> 03:15:34.130]  How's that?
[03:15:34.790 --> 03:15:39.672]  So, I'm not too worried about rumors and slander.
[03:15:40.212 --> 03:15:41.813]  It doesn't really affect me that much.
[03:15:41.853 --> 03:15:46.915]  I'm used to getting shot at, and all that tells me is what direction the enemy's coming in from.
[03:15:47.675 --> 03:15:51.276]  That's just the way 20 years of war will do to you.
[03:15:51.997 --> 03:15:55.718]  But what I really want to impart is the truth, and the truth is,
[03:15:56.488 --> 03:15:56.848]  We're good to go.
[03:15:56.868 --> 03:15:57.008]  I think?
[03:16:23.274 --> 03:16:25.756]  And that will all be lined out.
[03:16:26.177 --> 03:16:28.339]  The truth is that there's an invasion on the border.
[03:16:28.719 --> 03:16:34.144]  That's an invasion caused by poor policy and nefarious actors at many different levels.
[03:16:34.604 --> 03:16:35.565]  And we know who you are.
[03:16:35.605 --> 03:16:36.446]  And that's the problem.
[03:16:36.466 --> 03:16:37.327]  They're on their spurs.
[03:16:37.347 --> 03:16:38.167]  They're on their heels.
[03:16:38.728 --> 03:16:40.890]  And they're going to get vitriolic.
[03:16:40.910 --> 03:16:47.416]  They're going to increase, pump up the volume, so to speak, to squash whatever freedoms that we have.
[03:16:47.884 --> 03:16:49.486]  Because they don't believe we have freedoms.
[03:16:49.606 --> 03:16:50.848]  They are the elitists.
[03:16:51.429 --> 03:16:56.095]  And the elitists, quote-unquote, believe that they know better and we're going to eat Z-bugs.
[03:16:56.936 --> 03:16:57.277]  For you, Z.
[03:16:59.845 --> 03:17:05.911]  Well, let me just say, you know, I've seen some of the hit pieces in Australian media as well.
[03:17:05.991 --> 03:17:11.837]  Team, you've got a link I sent through earlier today, Wide Open US on Brink of Civil Unrest.
[03:17:11.877 --> 03:17:22.627]  And they've actually quoted Fox News in this article who mistakenly, you know, were, I mean, didn't do their research, didn't understand the Travis letter.
[03:17:23.867 --> 03:17:36.773]  And they're calling you, sort of painting you as some sort of commander, the coalition's commander, and really you're the liaison point between, you know, the organizers, law enforcement.
[03:17:37.333 --> 03:17:42.515]  And so, you know, I'm watching the media paint you in a certain light.
[03:17:43.055 --> 03:17:50.138]  And I know you personally, you know, this man is one of my good friends and a man of honor if you've ever met one.
[03:17:50.939 --> 03:18:04.165]  And so I really want to clarify for the sake of the media that haven't bothered to do their research, the Travis letter, why you quote it, surely Fox News would know American history, but apparently not.
[03:18:05.486 --> 03:18:06.206]  Right, perfect.
[03:18:06.226 --> 03:18:08.267]  And, you know, I suggest that they contact me
[03:18:09.453 --> 03:18:14.358]  Because they can clarify the inaccuracies that are in that piece of paper.
[03:18:14.418 --> 03:18:16.460]  I don't read these things, but people tell me.
[03:18:16.841 --> 03:18:17.782]  And I understand.
[03:18:17.802 --> 03:18:22.106]  If they just called me, I'd give them a great story, but I don't have time for them.
[03:18:22.665 --> 03:18:23.045]  We're good to go.
[03:18:43.456 --> 03:18:44.437]  Hundreds of thousands.
[03:18:44.857 --> 03:18:57.306]  Latest estimate, 126, roughly 120,000 of the 150,000 Chinese that have come across in the Biden administration, that's a lot, are male.
[03:18:57.747 --> 03:19:09.836]  Now, some of them are connected to females, and we'll get those numbers too, but that's coming out, and I keep close contact with Jason Jones, who is on the border all the time talking about this, giving us the actual numbers.
[03:19:10.456 --> 03:19:12.498]  I've seen them come across, but he has the numbers.
[03:19:12.558 --> 03:19:12.698]  Now,
[03:19:13.800 --> 03:19:15.302]  Let me go backwards just for a second.
[03:19:15.342 --> 03:19:18.364]  That Travis letter is something that's well known to every Texan.
[03:19:18.785 --> 03:19:25.551]  This is a letter that was on the 24th of February written, 1836, from the Commandancy of the Alamo.
[03:19:25.771 --> 03:19:28.554]  And this letter then, it epitomized
[03:19:29.369 --> 03:19:33.595]  A soldier who was a commander, William Barrett Travis, who was from South Carolina.
[03:19:33.615 --> 03:19:37.360]  This is why this kind of is going to resonate here a little bit.
[03:19:38.221 --> 03:19:41.606]  And he came here to stand a post to defend the Alamo.
[03:19:41.946 --> 03:19:45.892]  And he wrote a letter talking about the American character, which is something I talk a lot about.
[03:19:46.497 --> 03:19:49.741]  And it is to say that come to our aid with all dispatch.
[03:19:49.761 --> 03:19:51.663]  And this is what we are talking about.
[03:19:51.883 --> 03:20:01.054]  The rest of the country, the rest of the states in the United States are coming to the aid of Governor Abbott's government here in Texas.
[03:20:02.017 --> 03:20:02.577]  We're good to go.
[03:20:23.041 --> 03:20:26.943]  Now, we don't have time to sort that out right now because this is a 50-meter target.
[03:20:27.003 --> 03:20:28.023]  It's really close to us.
[03:20:28.404 --> 03:20:29.464]  We don't have time for that.
[03:20:29.884 --> 03:20:33.046]  What we have time for is truths and then bringing this light.
[03:20:33.066 --> 03:20:37.628]  Look, we've already done, or they've already done, what they wanted to do, which was to bring light to this.
[03:20:37.748 --> 03:20:39.949]  Now the discussion is, how do we keep it safe?
[03:20:39.989 --> 03:20:40.870]  And that's my job.
[03:20:40.990 --> 03:20:42.931]  And by the way, Doc, stay right there.
[03:20:43.011 --> 03:20:44.912]  I'm interrupting because I'm sitting here watching you guys.
[03:20:45.832 --> 03:20:48.054]  And I see them trying to get all this off balance.
[03:20:48.154 --> 03:20:49.114]  You're a great person.
[03:20:49.435 --> 03:20:56.179]  The people in the military, your great careers, Lieutenant Colonel and Doctor and all the things you did in secret operations and Maria Z and everybody.
[03:20:56.419 --> 03:20:57.720]  But it's important you address this.
[03:20:57.740 --> 03:20:58.681]  We need to move on from it.
[03:20:59.101 --> 03:21:06.906]  Just because we're on air telling listeners, look out for false flags, look out for leftist provocateurs, that doesn't mean the convoy organizers or the convoy is bad.
[03:21:07.286 --> 03:21:07.867]  It's great.
[03:21:08.207 --> 03:21:09.408]  Our reporters are down there now.
[03:21:09.788 --> 03:21:10.589]  I'm going down there.
[03:21:10.709 --> 03:21:11.709]  Everybody's going to be down there.
[03:21:12.010 --> 03:21:12.910]  This is God's work.
[03:21:12.930 --> 03:21:15.272]  And as you said on my show before the other states announced,
[03:21:15.752 --> 03:21:16.612]  We're good to go.
[03:21:44.742 --> 03:21:45.675]  They're so upset about...
[03:21:46.707 --> 03:21:54.754]  The attention that's being brought in here because they don't want populists and Christians and conservatives to get mobilized and to force multiply as you talk about.
[03:21:54.774 --> 03:21:55.494]  So I'm not going to interrupt.
[03:21:55.535 --> 03:21:56.595]  I'm going to keep listening.
[03:21:57.056 --> 03:21:58.597]  Maria Z is great getting you on.
[03:21:58.637 --> 03:22:00.399]  I want to get you back on the next few days.
[03:22:00.439 --> 03:22:01.319]  I know you're very, very busy.
[03:22:01.359 --> 03:22:02.240]  Our crew is going to be down there.
[03:22:02.580 --> 03:22:03.501]  I'll be down there soon.
[03:22:03.761 --> 03:22:14.891]  I hope to shift out of defense mode, which needs to be done, we can explain that, into operational mode and what people should be doing when they're down there, what the mission is to intensify the spotlighting.
[03:22:15.071 --> 03:22:15.912]  But I'm going to shut up now.
[03:22:15.972 --> 03:22:17.973]  I'm just going to say, you're the best.
[03:22:18.033 --> 03:22:18.953]  Maria Z is the best.
[03:22:19.214 --> 03:22:21.895]  And what you guys are doing is so incredibly admirable.
[03:22:22.235 --> 03:22:23.436]  And you're over the target.
[03:22:23.696 --> 03:22:24.317]  And it's beautiful.
[03:22:25.737 --> 03:22:27.098]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[03:22:27.719 --> 03:22:28.659]  Yeah, thank you, sir.
[03:22:28.699 --> 03:22:29.079]  I'm sorry.
[03:22:29.099 --> 03:22:29.880]  You know you go, Doug.
[03:22:31.460 --> 03:22:35.003]  Yeah, so that's a good segue into this because it's to understand my job.
[03:22:35.043 --> 03:22:36.944]  And my job is to be a liaison.
[03:22:37.104 --> 03:22:38.845]  I speak between the law enforcement.
[03:22:39.226 --> 03:22:39.986]  I don't speak for.
[03:22:40.466 --> 03:22:45.930]  I speak between the law enforcement and not for, but between the convoy organizers.
[03:22:46.311 --> 03:22:49.533]  So I've been organizing that liaison.
[03:22:50.013 --> 03:22:54.557]  And so that means that we keep it safe, and that means we keep those bad actors out.
[03:22:54.577 --> 03:22:56.459]  And I'm going to give you some insider information here.
[03:22:56.799 --> 03:23:05.887]  I have 12 names right now on my board upstairs, my whiteboard, where I'm following this, 12 names who will be exposed because they are agitators that are trying to get into the convoy.
[03:23:06.327 --> 03:23:06.427]  Yeah.
[03:23:29.428 --> 03:23:31.350]  And by the way, Doc, I said I was going to shut up.
[03:23:31.411 --> 03:23:32.131]  This is so huge.
[03:23:32.152 --> 03:23:33.213]  You've got to come on my show tomorrow.
[03:23:33.233 --> 03:23:33.974]  Maria, I apologize.
[03:23:34.194 --> 03:23:34.835]  But I'm here watching this.
[03:23:34.855 --> 03:23:36.357]  I was about to ask you, then I shut up.
[03:23:37.358 --> 03:23:45.248]  By liaisoning with law enforcement, you're going to vet and make sure and spotlight this so they can't send in provocateurs and do what they did on January 6th.
[03:23:45.288 --> 03:23:47.732]  So you don't want to hear this, but you're the hero.
[03:23:48.172 --> 03:23:48.652]  We're good to go.
[03:24:15.518 --> 03:24:16.860]  Okay, so exactly.
[03:24:16.900 --> 03:24:19.262]  So how that worked was, we the people.
[03:24:19.703 --> 03:24:31.635]  I literally am getting phone calls from kind of medium-sized, medium-level kind of podcasters that are down on the border paying attention, people that live in these towns who are saying, hey, do you know who this person is?
[03:24:31.675 --> 03:24:36.140]  He just showed up down here in this town of 48 people, and he's got, you know,
[03:24:36.917 --> 03:24:38.418]  Tags on here and it's a rental car.
[03:24:38.818 --> 03:24:40.138]  Well then, let's just figure it out.
[03:24:40.598 --> 03:24:44.340]  So then, between myself and law enforcement, we figured it out.
[03:24:44.580 --> 03:24:45.240]  It's that simple.
[03:24:45.640 --> 03:24:47.681]  And it's not anything top secret.
[03:24:47.721 --> 03:24:50.902]  This is open source and if they choose to put themselves there.
[03:24:50.922 --> 03:24:53.243]  But once we go, and this is the first name.
[03:24:53.263 --> 03:24:55.484]  I'm not going to say the name until we verify.
[03:24:55.604 --> 03:24:56.844]  But the first name came to me.
[03:24:57.404 --> 03:24:59.185]  I looked at it and said, I don't know who this person is.
[03:24:59.841 --> 03:25:03.504]  I called up the law enforcement and said, our Texas law enforcement, who is this guy?
[03:25:03.524 --> 03:25:03.884]  Do you know?
[03:25:03.944 --> 03:25:05.905]  And they said, this guy's a provocateur.
[03:25:06.186 --> 03:25:07.366]  This guy's an agitator.
[03:25:07.747 --> 03:25:09.668]  This guy is going to create a problem for you.
[03:25:09.728 --> 03:25:16.313]  So I have to advise the convoy that there is possibly a reason to be alerted to it.
[03:25:16.953 --> 03:25:17.894]  Does it mean you stop it?
[03:25:17.934 --> 03:25:22.097]  That's up to the convoy leaders that make that decision.
[03:25:22.317 --> 03:25:22.677]  I don't.
[03:25:23.157 --> 03:25:26.480]  But what I do is I say, this is how to keep from getting in trouble.
[03:25:26.540 --> 03:25:26.740]  Because
[03:25:28.229 --> 03:25:28.509]  Safe.
[03:25:29.009 --> 03:25:39.154]  I've seen a lot of chatter out there or hearing about a lot of chatter saying that the insiders of the convoy themselves are trying to get you into a January 6th situation.
[03:25:39.274 --> 03:25:39.455]  No.
[03:25:39.995 --> 03:25:41.536]  Because I've met these people.
[03:25:41.556 --> 03:25:42.636]  I've met at least three of them.
[03:25:42.736 --> 03:25:43.797]  I think there's five total.
[03:25:43.977 --> 03:25:44.557]  There may be more.
[03:25:45.297 --> 03:25:52.001]  That are honest, good souls who wanted to go down to Quimado, Texas because I recommended don't go into Eagle Pass.
[03:25:52.121 --> 03:25:52.621]  They're not.
[03:25:53.121 --> 03:25:56.543]  They're going to Quimado, which is 20 miles away to help a lady
[03:25:57.143 --> 03:26:09.349]  Who, when you hear her story, will become the centerpiece of this whole thing because she represents, that is, everything that is dear to the American character because she's a Christian lady who loves people both on the Mexican side and the U.S.
[03:26:09.369 --> 03:26:09.649]  side.
[03:26:09.949 --> 03:26:11.029]  You can't write this in a book.
[03:26:11.389 --> 03:26:20.954]  And then also, she helps run a battered women's shelter and an orphanage in the Mexican side about two miles from her into Mexico.
[03:26:21.254 --> 03:26:22.294]  She provides food.
[03:26:22.675 --> 03:26:23.695]  She provides services.
[03:26:23.755 --> 03:26:24.496]  That's how it started.
[03:26:50.256 --> 03:27:02.441]  Yeah, I think that a lot of the time, you know, the essence of why something is being done gets lost because everyone comes in with, you know, their opinion, thinking that they have intel.
[03:27:03.542 --> 03:27:11.785]  You know, we live in a very paranoid world, Doc, and part of the reason is because, you know, and here's the problem, right?
[03:27:11.986 --> 03:27:14.867]  When referencing Jan 6, for example, that was...
[03:27:15.543 --> 03:27:24.505]  Clearly, a government set up, and so people are afraid that every single organic citizens movement in future is a government set up.
[03:27:24.825 --> 03:27:28.866]  And that in itself is a major problem, because the government did that to the people.
[03:27:29.326 --> 03:27:34.848]  The government did that to deter anyone from ever gathering together in an organic movement.
[03:27:35.528 --> 03:27:37.268]  Are we going to be afraid of them forever?
[03:27:37.288 --> 03:27:40.449]  This ain't D.C., sister.
[03:27:41.730 --> 03:27:43.190]  This is Texas, by God.
[03:27:44.744 --> 03:27:45.365]  That's why.
[03:27:45.385 --> 03:27:48.870]  I will trust my sheriffs.
[03:27:49.491 --> 03:27:51.033]  I will trust my law enforcement.
[03:27:51.093 --> 03:27:52.295]  I will trust my constables.
[03:27:52.616 --> 03:27:55.420]  You know, we have a rally on the 1st.
[03:27:56.081 --> 03:27:58.124]  And in this rally in Dripping Springs, Texas...
[03:27:59.068 --> 03:27:59.448]  We're good to go.
[03:28:18.331 --> 03:28:18.992]  This is what the enemy fears.
[03:28:19.012 --> 03:28:20.293]  This is what the enemy fears.
[03:28:40.171 --> 03:28:45.318]  Patriot veterans, citizens with law enforcement, making sure it's all clean and good and strong.
[03:28:45.598 --> 03:28:47.100]  This is the answer to January 6th.
[03:28:47.140 --> 03:28:48.862]  This is victory in a bottle, folks.
[03:28:49.163 --> 03:28:50.044]  We'll be right back.
[03:28:50.064 --> 03:28:50.485]  Stay with us.

[03:29:34.978 --> 03:29:42.603]  People have reported a reduction in symptoms of insomnia, arthritis, seizures, chronic pain, and epilepsy.
[03:29:43.083 --> 03:29:49.707]  Several studies have shown it helps to reduce cortisol, increase serotonin, and boost vitality.
[03:29:50.608 --> 03:29:51.632]  Order yours today
[03:29:57.096 --> 03:30:01.377]  29 years on air, all I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalist.
[03:30:02.097 --> 03:30:07.398]  And I've done the best job I can to tell those words that have been accurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[03:30:07.798 --> 03:30:10.359]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves.
[03:30:10.779 --> 03:30:15.160]  Unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people, we don't do that.
[03:30:15.640 --> 03:30:17.520]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[03:30:17.900 --> 03:30:19.921]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product.
[03:30:19.941 --> 03:30:20.541]  It's so powerful.
[03:30:21.461 --> 03:30:31.525]  This is the breakdown product after your cells process it of folic acid, methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[03:30:31.965 --> 03:30:33.206]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[03:30:33.246 --> 03:30:34.446]  It's not a stimulant.
[03:30:34.566 --> 03:30:36.167]  It energizes your cells.
[03:30:36.747 --> 03:30:39.250]  And that everything else you take just supercharges it.
[03:30:39.290 --> 03:30:40.130]  It's so insane.
[03:30:40.471 --> 03:30:41.972]  It's foundational energy.
[03:30:42.433 --> 03:30:46.577]  The strongest formula out there at infowarsstore.com.
[03:30:46.977 --> 03:30:49.820]  It doesn't just energize this operation against the tyrants.
[03:30:49.900 --> 03:30:51.001]  It energizes you.
[03:30:51.021 --> 03:30:52.703]  Get foundational energy now.
[03:30:56.988 --> 03:31:03.513]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the globalist agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[03:31:03.573 --> 03:31:17.742]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections, masquerading as vaccines.
[03:31:17.882 --> 03:31:22.786]  It is so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives oblivious.
[03:31:24.342 --> 03:31:26.900]  You realize, anchored stop bliss, it equals death.
[03:31:28.547 --> 03:31:48.978]  But people are starting to really understand how serious things are, and that's a hard thing to do, because to wake up to a disturbing reality and realize that we're in the middle of a giant biological weapons war against humanity, and that there's mass sterilization that's already taking place, cutting off all the major energy sources, is really hard to deal with, but it's the reality.
[03:31:49.538 --> 03:31:53.720]  Facing it is our only chance to turn this around, because stuff's about to get really, really nasty.
[03:31:54.120 --> 03:31:54.761]  Infowars.com.
[03:31:56.864 --> 03:32:05.047]  Cellular damage from a type of free radical known as reactive oxygen species can cause decreased cellular function.

[03:32:25.857 --> 03:32:30.780]  Low levels of pregnenolone are associated with fatigue and low brain function.
[03:32:31.180 --> 03:32:39.184]  The real Red Pill Plus is also full of essential trace minerals to synergistically support optimal cognitive function.

[03:32:58.260 --> 03:33:04.165]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:24.637 --> 03:33:26.639]  The globalists fear what's happening.
[03:33:27.219 --> 03:33:40.331]  Retired military, special operations, law enforcement, police, working with the local counties and cities and the state government and 25 other state governments to spotlight the open human trafficking and criminal activity.
[03:33:40.531 --> 03:33:41.592]  Obviously, people are concerned.
[03:33:41.932 --> 03:33:49.759]  January 6th, we saw the setup, but you heard Doc Chambers, former Green Beret commander, medical doctor, lieutenant colonel, explaining that they've got the intel.
[03:33:50.259 --> 03:33:51.479]  They're spotlighting.
[03:33:51.539 --> 03:33:52.539]  They're with law enforcement.
[03:33:52.579 --> 03:33:53.800]  They know who the feds are.
[03:33:54.100 --> 03:33:56.160]  And they're going to be exposed.
[03:33:56.520 --> 03:33:58.000]  Because fool me once, shame on you.
[03:33:58.040 --> 03:33:59.281]  Fool me twice, shame on me.
[03:33:59.601 --> 03:34:00.881]  We are not being fooled here.
[03:34:01.081 --> 03:34:02.081]  Everybody should go to the border.
[03:34:02.421 --> 03:34:03.421]  Our team is now there.
[03:34:03.601 --> 03:34:04.061]  I'm going.
[03:34:04.162 --> 03:34:08.462]  I'm going to get to the rally in Dripping Springs coming up on the 1st on Friday.
[03:34:08.822 --> 03:34:10.203]  This is so exciting.
[03:34:10.243 --> 03:34:12.463]  And I'm going to let Maria Z take back over here.
[03:34:12.763 --> 03:34:16.004]  But I want Doc Chambers, Lieutenant Colonel, to, again, elaborate.
[03:34:16.044 --> 03:34:17.004]  He's going to interrupt me.
[03:34:18.024 --> 03:34:18.725]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:34:18.765 --> 03:34:19.505]  Please go on, Doc.
[03:34:44.328 --> 03:34:44.929]  Where were we?
[03:34:45.089 --> 03:34:46.971]  Okay, so we were talking about America.
[03:34:47.952 --> 03:34:49.533]  So that's what it is.
[03:34:49.633 --> 03:34:55.819]  I think it's just important to really... I know you've already said it, but it's very important to highlight what Alex just said.
[03:34:56.239 --> 03:35:00.263]  Because they are terrified of people actually working together.
[03:35:00.303 --> 03:35:01.925]  You know, they have worked so hard...
[03:35:02.245 --> 03:35:05.948]  To create this divide between local law enforcement and the people.
[03:35:06.248 --> 03:35:07.208]  There's resentment.
[03:35:07.809 --> 03:35:09.550]  The people think they don't work together.
[03:35:09.630 --> 03:35:13.052]  All law enforcement is out to get us, but that is absolutely not the case.
[03:35:13.413 --> 03:35:23.499]  The people right now in the United States, and I've always said it, I've always said that if the United States, if they manage to defeat the United States, the rest of the West will fall.
[03:35:23.760 --> 03:35:28.763]  But they're not going to defeat the United States because the people of America are
[03:35:29.542 --> 03:35:33.265]  Oh, I know the leftist NGOs.
[03:35:33.445 --> 03:35:34.566]  I know the leftist NGOs.
[03:35:34.586 --> 03:35:36.147]  They're targeting Doc Chambers right now.
[03:35:36.167 --> 03:35:36.908]  I know he loves it.
[03:35:37.728 --> 03:35:38.949]  But he's not talking about it.
[03:35:39.890 --> 03:35:42.411]  Soros is crapping bricks right now.
[03:35:43.572 --> 03:35:44.213]  Full panic mode.
[03:35:44.233 --> 03:35:45.073]  They're attacking us.
[03:35:45.334 --> 03:35:46.634]  They're trying to hack us right now.
[03:35:46.915 --> 03:35:48.396]  They are shitting bricks right now.
[03:35:48.676 --> 03:35:50.077]  Pardon the French, but it's true.
[03:35:50.317 --> 03:35:51.458]  That's why I'm so excited right now.
[03:35:53.680 --> 03:36:08.716]  But please go on, Doc Pete Chambers, because it's so important for people to understand this relationship that's forming between the people and local law enforcement who are united over this one cause, which is to protect their country.
[03:36:10.217 --> 03:36:10.497]  Right.
[03:36:10.597 --> 03:36:10.878]  You know,
[03:36:11.641 --> 03:36:16.505]  Maria, that's very grassroots how this happened.
[03:36:17.886 --> 03:36:35.079]  If we just continue this same pattern of having a liaison who understands both worlds, all the way across this country, and then we the people end up becoming a neighborhood watch program, a state watch program, that would be my recommendation because that has the little victories that's going to pull us out of this Stockholm Syndrome.
[03:36:35.726 --> 03:36:35.906]  Right?
[03:36:36.346 --> 03:36:40.748]  I'm still keeping cooler heads to prevail because I don't want them to be targeted.
[03:36:40.828 --> 03:36:42.028]  I'm doing everything I can.
[03:36:42.348 --> 03:36:46.389]  And listen, if they are not targeted, understand this, and this is very important.
[03:36:46.669 --> 03:36:49.870]  If overtly, now, I know they're being targeted.
[03:36:50.290 --> 03:36:59.733]  If they are overtly, it's not evident, then guys like me, about two weeks from now, are going to sit around a campfire, have a cigar and some scotch and go, we did a good job.
[03:37:00.694 --> 03:37:01.634]  And nobody's ever going to know.
[03:37:02.825 --> 03:37:04.548]  That's right.
[03:37:04.588 --> 03:37:07.111]  The mission is to stop them before they pull something.
[03:37:08.272 --> 03:37:08.653]  Correct.
[03:37:09.134 --> 03:37:13.219]  And so if we stop them, then we deny territory.
[03:37:13.259 --> 03:37:14.781]  That's a plan.
[03:37:14.821 --> 03:37:16.143]  That's a thing that happens.
[03:37:16.730 --> 03:37:20.151]  But this requires... Look, I'm walking around like Andy Taylor right now.
[03:37:20.471 --> 03:37:21.151]  I got no guns.
[03:37:21.651 --> 03:37:22.131]  I got nothing.
[03:37:22.371 --> 03:37:22.951]  You know what I got?
[03:37:23.152 --> 03:37:23.792]  I got brains.
[03:37:24.052 --> 03:37:25.972]  I got a heart, and I care about Americans.
[03:37:26.312 --> 03:37:28.053]  And so for me, that's all that matters.
[03:37:28.553 --> 03:37:39.956]  I got a mean dog that works around with me, so don't sneak up behind me if you want to pull a Congressman Katko, that guy from New York that tried to come down to the border, and he was one of the 11 that voted against Trump.
[03:37:40.416 --> 03:37:41.796]  Anyway, that's another story.
[03:37:42.396 --> 03:37:43.856]  So I think that right now...
[03:37:46.969 --> 03:37:55.292]  My job is going to be to continue to liaise, to bring some knowledge, because we fear that which we do not know.
[03:37:55.992 --> 03:37:57.293]  They have to know what's going on.
[03:37:57.333 --> 03:38:02.715]  I have to tell them, hey guys, this is what's happening, and then what are you going to do with your convoy?
[03:38:02.735 --> 03:38:03.415]  And they can tell me.
[03:38:03.515 --> 03:38:05.456]  I can put them wherever they want.
[03:38:05.516 --> 03:38:07.857]  I can lead them to that to keep it safe.
[03:38:07.957 --> 03:38:09.437]  I don't want them to fall into a trap.
[03:38:09.497 --> 03:38:10.798]  That is my whole goal in this.
[03:38:11.519 --> 03:38:12.880]  But they've got to know what's going on.
[03:38:13.241 --> 03:38:14.462]  Then they have to pray about it.
[03:38:14.822 --> 03:38:15.963]  And they have to make a decision.
[03:38:16.363 --> 03:38:18.946]  Because the ultimate end state is the kingdom.
[03:38:19.106 --> 03:38:20.067]  The kingdom of God.
[03:38:20.167 --> 03:38:20.507]  I know.
[03:38:21.007 --> 03:38:22.188]  The army of God thing, right?
[03:38:22.789 --> 03:38:23.229]  Guess what?
[03:38:24.010 --> 03:38:24.430]  Google it.
[03:38:24.531 --> 03:38:25.191]  It might help you.
[03:38:26.612 --> 03:38:27.693]  It's not a club.
[03:38:28.634 --> 03:38:29.575]  It's way bigger than that.
[03:38:29.595 --> 03:38:31.577]  Look at the left.
[03:38:31.597 --> 03:38:34.359]  There are a bunch of open Satanists saying their God is Satan.
[03:38:34.379 --> 03:38:35.220]  It's all over the news.
[03:38:35.700 --> 03:38:36.982]  You either choose God or the devil.
[03:38:37.002 --> 03:38:38.363]  Folks, we've got to have God to win this.
[03:38:40.120 --> 03:38:46.927]  Absolutely, and Doc's referencing a host of articles that have been written that he's always in the army of God.
[03:38:47.367 --> 03:38:51.231]  It's hilarious that these people will openly promote Satanism.
[03:38:52.833 --> 03:38:54.414]  Do you want the URL for that?
[03:38:54.494 --> 03:38:57.157]  Because it's called the Holy Bible, all right?
[03:38:57.377 --> 03:38:59.259]  So that's where you can find that.
[03:38:59.860 --> 03:39:01.461]  So, honestly...
[03:39:03.211 --> 03:39:09.775]  I'm going to make sure that from this part of Texas to wherever they go, however they do it, because guess what?
[03:39:09.855 --> 03:39:10.675]  They might be fooled.
[03:39:10.715 --> 03:39:11.676]  We might pull a feign.
[03:39:11.936 --> 03:39:13.256]  We might move them an end around.
[03:39:13.296 --> 03:39:16.618]  We might move them to Rio Grande Valley because I'm going to keep them safe.
[03:39:16.898 --> 03:39:22.561]  I'm not going to allow you to set up your geofencing and your birds in the sky so you're going to know where we're at.
[03:39:22.862 --> 03:39:25.223]  We might send everybody out to 20 different locations.
[03:39:25.563 --> 03:39:26.063]  I don't know.
[03:39:26.544 --> 03:39:27.704]  But we're not going to do one thing.
[03:39:27.884 --> 03:39:28.585]  There's a couple things.
[03:39:28.845 --> 03:39:30.406]  We're not going to hinder law enforcement.
[03:39:30.746 --> 03:39:32.527]  We are not going to, and I'm speaking for me,
[03:39:33.307 --> 03:39:34.188]  I'm not speaking for the convoy.
[03:39:34.208 --> 03:39:34.969]  I've got to be careful here.
[03:39:35.309 --> 03:39:36.390]  The convoy has their plans.
[03:39:37.171 --> 03:39:45.919]  But I would imagine that if I gave them the scenario, they would understand, and they were not going to hinder anything that the state or the local law enforcement is doing.
[03:39:45.959 --> 03:39:47.621]  They're not going to allow anything to get in the way.
[03:39:48.021 --> 03:39:50.143]  They still exercise their First Amendment rights.
[03:39:50.203 --> 03:39:51.284]  That's the whole point of this.
[03:39:51.604 --> 03:39:52.485]  A peaceful assembly.
[03:39:52.525 --> 03:39:55.668]  And, Doc, don't the local police need... They love this.
[03:39:55.708 --> 03:39:56.549]  They love the support.
[03:39:58.160 --> 03:39:59.521]  No, that's case by case.
[03:39:59.662 --> 03:40:03.566]  You know, there are some, I hate to say this, there are some people that have sold their souls.
[03:40:03.586 --> 03:40:06.789]  You know, I don't know that many sheriffs in Texas.
[03:40:06.829 --> 03:40:08.871]  I think I know about 18 of them, personally.
[03:40:09.271 --> 03:40:15.157]  And I know those people, and there's probably one or two I probably wouldn't want to go have drinks with, to be honest with you.
[03:40:15.197 --> 03:40:15.978]  That's unfortunate.
[03:40:16.058 --> 03:40:19.542]  But that's why we the people vote those kind of people out.
[03:40:19.642 --> 03:40:21.544]  And we'll bring their names up after this is over.
[03:40:23.920 --> 03:40:31.804]  And to confirm as well, I know that you've been working with senators even in Texas, so you have a lot of support from government.
[03:40:32.024 --> 03:40:41.930]  That's the thing that's so different about this situation where all of these, you know, law enforcement, government, the people, everyone is united.
[03:40:41.950 --> 03:40:42.890]  That's what I'm trying to say.
[03:40:42.990 --> 03:40:47.253]  And Alex is right on the money that they are terrified of this.
[03:40:47.553 --> 03:40:49.714]  Please let people know you've been working with senators as well.
[03:40:51.047 --> 03:40:56.749]  Right, yeah, state senators, at least one that actually has visited us and is probably going to come here and listen to this.
[03:40:57.509 --> 03:41:01.770]  We might even have a representation from the governor himself.
[03:41:01.850 --> 03:41:14.854]  He may not be able to make it, but if we can support his 24 January, which we read on that set that Alex is sitting there, 24 January, we read that letter that he wrote, which was based upon
[03:41:15.552 --> 03:41:16.532]  The Constitution.
[03:41:16.692 --> 03:41:18.553]  It wasn't case law he was talking about.
[03:41:18.893 --> 03:41:21.553]  He's not quoting or he's not referencing case law.
[03:41:21.813 --> 03:41:38.616]  He's reflecting articles in the Constitution, which is exactly what enumerates the ability for citizens to have power in their own hands because they can walk in that and know with pride and with comfort and no fear that they can exercise the American character.
[03:41:38.856 --> 03:41:43.537]  And in Texas, you add that to that mix and it's devastating to the deep state.
[03:41:45.191 --> 03:41:55.960]  Well, let me just really, I want to highlight as well the desired outcome of this convoy and what the people are actually seeking because we want to make that very, very clear.
[03:41:55.980 --> 03:42:07.810]  The convoy will come and go, but we want, we, the people, and I'm saying we, I'm including myself in this because I want to see this invasion stop, you know, just as much as anyone else, you know.
[03:42:07.830 --> 03:42:12.494]  I'm horrified at what I'm witnessing over there and you know how much I love Texas.
[03:42:13.134 --> 03:42:22.582]  And so, what is the desired outcome that the people are seeking, and what are they going to keep doing to make sure that that desired outcome is achieved, even after the convoy?
[03:42:23.662 --> 03:42:34.931]  So the updated information on that is specifically on TakeOurBorderBack.com, because as we see things, IEDs in the road, as we see these attempts that we're trying to thwart,
[03:42:35.421 --> 03:42:36.061]  I think we're good to go.
[03:43:01.320 --> 03:43:11.937]  That was there, not even on the mall, just around the periphery, and the FBI showed up at their house and knocked everything down, went in, took all their stuff, had Grandma and Grandpa handcuffed on the porch for six hours.
[03:43:12.338 --> 03:43:15.724]  All right, that's not what is going to happen this time because...
[03:43:16.954 --> 03:43:19.938]  Everything that they're talking about, I'm going to read it verbatim just so you can hear it.
[03:43:19.958 --> 03:43:26.265]  The goal is simple, to shed light on the obvious dangers posed by wide open southern borders.
[03:43:26.625 --> 03:43:27.967]  To request all laws of the U.S.
[03:43:28.007 --> 03:43:29.769]  Constitution be immediately upheld.
[03:43:30.069 --> 03:43:36.737]  This is a petition to slow and ultimately stop the drug trafficking and human trafficking associated with open borders.
[03:43:37.057 --> 03:43:39.338]  Now, by God, that's the most important thing for me.
[03:43:39.778 --> 03:43:45.280]  Because those children that I looked in the face of, that I handed off to federal workers, were Border Patrol people.
[03:43:45.320 --> 03:43:46.020]  They're good people.
[03:43:46.080 --> 03:43:47.280]  But what happens to them after that?
[03:43:47.460 --> 03:43:48.341]  I looked in their eyes.
[03:43:48.701 --> 03:43:49.681]  I can't unsee that.
[03:43:50.021 --> 03:43:53.962]  Because I know what the ultimate demise of some of those children are.
[03:43:53.982 --> 03:43:54.323]  86,000 at least.
[03:43:54.643 --> 03:43:55.443]  Probably more than that.
[03:43:55.863 --> 03:43:58.004]  And that stuff right there is satanic.
[03:43:58.104 --> 03:44:01.466]  That stuff right there is putting these children on the altar of Molech.
[03:44:01.506 --> 03:44:02.587]  And I'm just not going to do this.
[03:44:02.647 --> 03:44:03.307]  Not on my watch.
[03:44:03.827 --> 03:44:06.469]  I got kids, grandkids, and I care about your kids, America.
[03:44:06.609 --> 03:44:06.929]  I do.
[03:44:07.229 --> 03:44:16.634]  I've gone downrange, taken a bullet for your children in uniform for a war that, unfortunately, after the facts, I did not believe in after I learned what happened.
[03:44:16.654 --> 03:44:17.754]  That's a whole other subject.
[03:44:18.095 --> 03:44:18.915]  So, sorry.
[03:44:19.095 --> 03:44:20.136]  I got out of control.
[03:44:20.316 --> 03:44:20.716]  But that's it.
[03:44:23.090 --> 03:44:26.940]  What do you really want to leave with the people, Doc?
[03:44:27.000 --> 03:44:28.805]  What is it that you want them to know most?
[03:44:32.090 --> 03:44:38.034]  That the first virtue here, the most important virtue in all of this is going to be love.
[03:44:38.434 --> 03:44:41.916]  When you meet that lady down there in Kimato, it's going to emanate off of her.
[03:44:42.016 --> 03:44:43.317]  It's going to exude off of her.
[03:44:43.717 --> 03:44:46.018]  And it's love because that's the truest virtue of a warrior.
[03:44:46.379 --> 03:44:47.759]  But with that comes tough love.
[03:44:47.779 --> 03:44:50.581]  And with the tough love comes accountability.
[03:44:51.041 --> 03:44:55.064]  And accountability is one of the most important things in the world to a guy like me.
[03:44:55.364 --> 03:44:57.265]  When somebody makes a mistake, they got the choice.
[03:44:57.545 --> 03:44:58.606]  They can pivot off of it.
[03:44:59.026 --> 03:44:59.567]  We're good to go.
[03:45:19.085 --> 03:45:22.008]  And if they agree with me and they're not doing it, I plead with them.
[03:45:22.368 --> 03:45:24.630]  At this point now, we're going to expose.
[03:45:24.750 --> 03:45:31.295]  And the next thing is going to be, I will be sitting on those tribunals, if I can, to make sure that we bring those things to light.
[03:45:32.456 --> 03:45:45.467]  And unfortunately, even if they wore a uniform that I did, if they broke the law and they're treasonous or they were derelict, dereliction of duty, then, you know, that's up to the judge.
[03:45:45.567 --> 03:45:46.248]  That's not up to me.
[03:45:47.887 --> 03:45:54.448]  Well, I think it's very important that the globalists understand that the people aren't giving up.
[03:45:54.888 --> 03:45:57.929]  We have to continuously be sending them that message.
[03:45:59.249 --> 03:46:12.411]  And I just want to ask from the people that you know are involved in this convoy, which I really think is one of the most historic things, certainly in my lifetime, where's their mindset, Doc?
[03:46:12.511 --> 03:46:13.391]  What are they thinking?
[03:46:18.624 --> 03:46:24.885]  Based upon the meetings that I've had with them, I've met them a few times, and I didn't organize it, but I'll tell you, their hearts are pure.
[03:46:26.426 --> 03:46:29.326]  They are godly people who care about people.
[03:46:29.786 --> 03:46:32.927]  And it's not that they don't want... They're not even talking about the immigrants.
[03:46:32.947 --> 03:46:34.527]  They're talking about protecting them.
[03:46:35.167 --> 03:46:35.427]  Right?
[03:46:35.927 --> 03:46:36.588]  They're illegal.
[03:46:36.708 --> 03:46:37.128]  I got it.
[03:46:37.488 --> 03:46:40.728]  But when you see them walk across and you hand them to somebody, they're going to disappear.
[03:46:40.808 --> 03:46:43.329]  That's what they're concerned about, is those people's lives.
[03:46:44.013 --> 03:46:49.857]  Because it's called a humanitarian mission or it's called a humanitarian effort.
[03:46:50.858 --> 03:46:55.801]  There's nothing humanitarian about a child floating down the river bloated up from being in the sun.
[03:46:56.365 --> 03:46:56.505]  I think?
[03:47:18.396 --> 03:47:18.616]  I think.
[03:47:43.746 --> 03:47:47.389]  And he got his citizenship, and it was the most proud American I ever met.
[03:47:47.809 --> 03:47:50.711]  And he said to me, son, someday you're going to serve this country.
[03:47:51.072 --> 03:48:01.599]  And in September of 1983, I put on a uniform, and I finally took it off last year, and I've got my Let's Go Brandon signature on the wall over there on the thank you for your 39 years of service.
[03:48:02.080 --> 03:48:05.042]  And I want President Trump, if he would, please listen to this.
[03:48:05.422 --> 03:48:06.563]  Can you sign that thing?
[03:48:06.603 --> 03:48:08.104]  Because I need it over his name.
[03:48:08.825 --> 03:48:09.085]  All right?
[03:48:09.165 --> 03:48:09.765]  That's personal.
[03:48:09.906 --> 03:48:10.226]  All right.
[03:48:12.947 --> 03:48:13.709]  That's wonderful.
[03:48:14.711 --> 03:48:23.588]  I think, again, it's very important to highlight, even for all of the mainstream media that's misconstrued this, you know, I sent you that article from the Australian media.
[03:48:24.275 --> 03:48:25.035]  I think we're good to go.
[03:48:46.124 --> 03:48:47.084]  I think we're good to go.
[03:49:05.493 --> 03:49:11.696]  Stop trying now, because everyone around the world is just not putting up with it anymore.
[03:49:11.716 --> 03:49:12.336]  They're not listening.
[03:49:12.376 --> 03:49:20.220]  But it's, you know, like I was saying, this Axios article saying all these mainstream media outlets are letting go of all of these journalists.
[03:49:20.440 --> 03:49:27.704]  Well, what do you expect when you publish things like this, like the article that they brought up before, that the team brought up before in the Australian media?
[03:49:28.144 --> 03:49:29.664]  This is one of the top news sites.
[03:49:29.724 --> 03:49:31.685]  I haven't done an ounce of research.
[03:49:32.005 --> 03:49:33.665]  Don't understand the history of Texas.
[03:49:33.685 --> 03:49:37.026]  You best shut up and let the real people report on this.
[03:49:38.547 --> 03:49:38.787]  Right.
[03:49:38.827 --> 03:49:40.887]  Yeah, there's a certain sense of pride that comes with that.
[03:49:40.927 --> 03:49:44.788]  But there's also, to me, who served with a U.S.
[03:49:45.268 --> 03:49:47.949]  flag on my shoulder, and now we'll just say a Texas flag.
[03:49:48.289 --> 03:49:52.030]  Look, there's a pride in the people of this country.
[03:49:52.580 --> 03:49:52.960]  We're good to go.
[03:50:16.912 --> 03:50:17.572]  What just happened?
[03:50:40.945 --> 03:50:44.527]  Now the law enforcement calls me and says, okay, do you know what's going on?
[03:50:44.547 --> 03:50:46.048]  Because I told them to call me.
[03:50:46.489 --> 03:50:47.389]  And I said, absolutely.
[03:50:47.449 --> 03:50:48.430]  I'm your liaison.
[03:50:48.850 --> 03:50:50.411]  And they're like, what are you doing, Doc?
[03:50:50.471 --> 03:50:51.171]  We saw this thing.
[03:50:51.452 --> 03:50:53.793]  You're taking the Green Berets to the border.
[03:50:53.873 --> 03:50:54.974]  I'm not in command of anybody.
[03:50:55.254 --> 03:50:59.397]  I'm in command of my Remnant A team, which is a humanitarian project.
[03:50:59.717 --> 03:51:01.098]  That's a totally separate deal.
[03:51:01.938 --> 03:51:02.118]  Right?
[03:51:02.278 --> 03:51:03.279]  That's a totally separate deal.
[03:51:03.599 --> 03:51:05.961]  But they've taken that and they added it to the...
[03:51:07.094 --> 03:51:07.355]  I think?
[03:51:23.235 --> 03:51:24.055]  That's all I know.
[03:51:24.475 --> 03:51:25.556]  I'm a pretty simple guy.
[03:51:26.056 --> 03:51:28.116]  I'm not a high-speed, you know, brain surgeon.
[03:51:28.457 --> 03:51:29.937]  I'm a plumber on the battlefield.
[03:51:30.037 --> 03:51:32.498]  An emergency room guy who stopped bleeding in combat.
[03:51:32.778 --> 03:51:38.079]  But I'm smart enough to know and I have enough discerning spirit to know what is right and what is wrong.
[03:51:38.599 --> 03:51:40.500]  And I care for you if you're on the dark side.
[03:51:40.560 --> 03:51:40.900]  I do.
[03:51:41.260 --> 03:51:44.181]  But I hope that you get it on straight because you don't have a lot of time left.
[03:51:44.681 --> 03:51:47.522]  Not for me, but just time in general.
[03:51:47.842 --> 03:51:49.002]  And you have time to pivot.
[03:51:49.362 --> 03:51:50.143]  That's all I'm asking.
[03:51:50.163 --> 03:51:50.863]  I'm not going to preach.
[03:51:50.923 --> 03:51:51.183]  Sorry.
[03:51:52.737 --> 03:51:54.077]  No, don't be sorry.
[03:51:54.157 --> 03:51:54.918]  I appreciate it.
[03:51:54.998 --> 03:51:56.238]  I think this is so vital.
[03:51:57.798 --> 03:52:00.879]  And, you know, really reinforcing for the people what this is.
[03:52:01.019 --> 03:52:04.980]  Like I said, there are, you know, there are a lot of opinions.
[03:52:05.000 --> 03:52:08.621]  Many, many people are paranoid about everything these days.
[03:52:09.262 --> 03:52:10.282]  It's only natural.
[03:52:10.982 --> 03:52:11.462]  We're good to go.
[03:52:30.091 --> 03:52:36.574]  And, you know, that same police force right now that did that in Victoria, that's iconic footage.
[03:52:36.634 --> 03:52:37.415]  Everyone's seen it.
[03:52:37.695 --> 03:52:47.740]  They're now attending drag queen story time and, you know, drag queen events and all of this stuff, embroidering rainbow stuff on their uniforms.
[03:52:47.800 --> 03:52:51.862]  That's what they spend their time doing, you know, on social media at least.
[03:52:52.222 --> 03:52:55.143]  And so, you know, they're attacking you.
[03:52:55.203 --> 03:52:56.504]  They're demoralizing you.
[03:52:56.864 --> 03:52:57.404]  We're good to go.
[03:53:23.914 --> 03:53:24.074]  Right.
[03:53:24.154 --> 03:53:29.659]  I don't expect everyone to agree with me on this thing that's happening.
[03:53:29.739 --> 03:53:43.572]  I didn't plan this thing, but I'm going to tell you that I'm going to take care of this thing because these are Americans doing what they should do, which is to demonstrate the First Amendment right to petition, to say, no, this is wrong, it's not constitutional.
[03:53:44.052 --> 03:53:46.474]  Then after that, the second and third order of effects of that.
[03:53:47.055 --> 03:53:49.077]  If we back down now, if they back down now,
[03:53:49.565 --> 03:53:50.386]  Completely back down.
[03:53:50.526 --> 03:53:55.629]  And turn their trucks around in the middle of wherever they're at right now, Alabama or something.
[03:53:55.689 --> 03:53:57.931]  That's not dear to the American character.
[03:53:59.071 --> 03:54:11.620]  But the other side of this is that I will, because I'm acting as a liaison, I'm not getting paid for it, so there's not that, but I will listen to the law enforcement and I will share with them what is important to them
[03:54:12.341 --> 03:54:14.603]  Because they're conducting operations, too.
[03:54:14.663 --> 03:54:25.933]  There are real-world operations going on all the time at all levels of law enforcement in the state of Texas that are stopping those child traffickers all the way to the narco-terrorists, etc.
[03:54:26.253 --> 03:54:28.255]  So, we will not hinder any of that.
[03:54:28.335 --> 03:54:29.456]  They will not hinder any of that.
[03:54:29.656 --> 03:54:33.119]  I will step in the gap and say, hey, guys, instead of doing this, do that.
[03:54:33.819 --> 03:54:35.441]  Instead of doing this, you might want to do that.
[03:54:35.501 --> 03:54:37.903]  Because they were going to circle the Austin Capitol.
[03:54:38.576 --> 03:54:47.619]  I got an understanding of, and I know what downtown Austin looks like, and you don't want to bring in 20 trucks in there, much less whatever comes here.
[03:54:48.040 --> 03:54:50.260]  So that's a negotiation.
[03:54:51.461 --> 03:54:51.661]  Right.
[03:54:52.181 --> 03:54:52.701]  Yeah.
[03:54:52.721 --> 03:54:58.724]  So that's a negotiation to make sure that stays safe and it doesn't hinder the locals because what is the real center of gravity of anything?
[03:54:58.884 --> 03:55:02.885]  Look, for Green Beret, that's people because it's hearts and minds and it's truly people.
[03:55:03.045 --> 03:55:04.886]  We develop the relationships and live with them.
[03:55:05.512 --> 03:55:11.837]  For the other guys downrange doing stuff, they do things that they focus on different tactical and strategic points.
[03:55:12.778 --> 03:55:13.519]  For us, it's people.
[03:55:14.059 --> 03:55:15.200]  That's the most important thing.
[03:55:15.440 --> 03:55:16.321]  We learn about them.
[03:55:16.381 --> 03:55:23.427]  We try to embed with them so that we can really learn and then help them to free themselves from oppression.
[03:55:23.727 --> 03:55:25.929]  The motto of the Green Berets, De oppresso libera.
[03:55:27.390 --> 03:55:33.532]  So now, if we're doing that, the Center of Gravity's people, we focus on this lady in our minds that we've got to help her out.
[03:55:33.872 --> 03:55:35.693]  She represents the Texans.
[03:55:36.313 --> 03:55:37.413]  So that's the end point.
[03:55:37.794 --> 03:55:39.394]  That's where they were going to go.
[03:55:39.454 --> 03:55:40.795]  That's where they were going to set up.
[03:55:41.275 --> 03:55:42.775]  And now people are saying, don't do that.
[03:55:42.895 --> 03:55:43.455]  It's a trap.
[03:55:44.036 --> 03:55:48.037]  Well, that then is the symptom of the disease of cowardice.
[03:55:48.812 --> 03:55:49.413]  We're good to go.
[03:56:03.982 --> 03:56:04.522]  That's okay.
[03:56:04.562 --> 03:56:05.463]  Those are all symptoms.
[03:56:05.863 --> 03:56:10.165]  But the answer to that is the little victories that we talk about in all the things we do.
[03:56:10.205 --> 03:56:14.868]  It's a mama bear at a school function saying, no, my kids aren't going to read those books.
[03:56:15.708 --> 03:56:22.011]  It's the two people that showed up today going to Dripping Springs who said, hey, we've got our camper.
[03:56:22.031 --> 03:56:25.373]  We came here from Nevada, and we want to be ready for this thing.
[03:56:25.413 --> 03:56:27.154]  We can't drive all the way to the East Coast.
[03:56:27.514 --> 03:56:31.196]  But they're just a mom and dad who are retired military guys that said, how can we help?
[03:56:31.676 --> 03:56:33.179]  I mean, that's what that looks like.
[03:56:33.259 --> 03:56:34.621]  That's a little victory, right?
[03:56:34.641 --> 03:56:39.530]  Because the little victories collectively are going to stop this death of a thousand cuts.
[03:56:41.139 --> 03:56:41.860]  It's humanity.
[03:56:42.240 --> 03:56:43.561]  It's humanity uniting.
[03:56:44.021 --> 03:56:50.566]  It's humanity putting every difference aside and uniting over one common thing, which everyone agrees on.
[03:56:50.926 --> 03:56:53.128]  And they're terrified of that.
[03:56:53.428 --> 03:56:55.009]  And they've always been terrified of that.
[03:56:55.050 --> 03:56:58.172]  And that is why the division tactics are coming thick and fast.
[03:56:58.832 --> 03:57:00.554]  And it's always the case.
[03:57:00.614 --> 03:57:04.536]  Whenever people are uniting, there's always an effort to disperse them.
[03:57:04.717 --> 03:57:06.238]  And I'm so glad...
[03:57:06.838 --> 03:57:14.307]  Dr. Pete Chambers, that you're at the forefront of keeping all of this glued together, helping to keep people safe.
[03:57:15.028 --> 03:57:20.655]  I couldn't think of a better person to be the liaison point between law enforcement and the people right now.
[03:57:21.095 --> 03:57:23.378]  Give people the website and where they can follow you quickly.
[03:57:24.471 --> 03:57:26.954]  Yeah, well, right now it's TakeOurBorderBack.com.
[03:57:26.994 --> 03:57:28.455]  That's where I really want people to focus.
[03:57:28.836 --> 03:57:31.438]  For me, there's not much going on on my website right now.
[03:57:31.458 --> 03:57:34.361]  It's DrPeteChambers.com, DrPeteChambers.com.
[03:57:34.722 --> 03:57:42.110]  That's all my previous lines of effort from whistleblowing all the way down to... TakeOurBorderBack.com, where the clock's running out.
[03:57:42.190 --> 03:57:44.052]  God bless you, Dr. Pete Chambers.
[03:57:44.112 --> 03:57:45.013]  God bless Texas.
[03:57:46.510 --> 03:57:48.072]  I'm not on Team NFL.
[03:57:48.372 --> 03:57:49.874]  I'm not on Team NBA.
[03:57:50.054 --> 03:57:51.035]  I'm not on Team Olympics.
[03:57:51.295 --> 03:57:54.759]  I'm not on Team Globalist or Wokeism in the New World Order.
[03:57:54.979 --> 03:58:05.210]  I'm on Team Humanity, ladies and gentlemen, that loves God and loves our families and loves humanity and knows that we're destined to do even more incredible things than we've already done together.
[03:58:05.390 --> 03:58:09.074]  And so, inspired by my conversation with Elon Musk recently...
[03:58:09.394 --> 03:58:11.637]  I think he agreed with my idea to call it Team Humanity.
[03:58:11.877 --> 03:58:16.363]  We've launched two limited edition t-shirts at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:58:16.664 --> 03:58:20.629]  Let people know that, hey, it isn't about the football games or it isn't even about the UFC.
[03:58:21.110 --> 03:58:25.175]  It's about Team Humanity being under globalist attack.
[03:58:25.476 --> 03:58:25.816]  You kid.
[03:58:26.497 --> 03:58:26.857]  Wear it.
[03:58:27.117 --> 03:58:35.441]  It's a great conversation starter, and you know it's supporting the InfoWar that is at the very tip of the spear in the fight for Team Humanity.
[03:58:35.781 --> 03:58:40.422]  Get your limited edition Team Humanity t-shirts right now at InfoWarStore.com, and I thank you.
[03:58:46.451 --> 03:58:46.891]  I think?
[03:59:09.486 --> 03:59:10.006]  We're good to go.
[03:59:28.659 --> 03:59:33.741]  To not lose the greatest symbol against tyranny the world has ever seen, and that's our American flag.
[03:59:33.761 --> 03:59:35.622]  And with that, I appreciate loving forwards.
[03:59:35.722 --> 03:59:39.984]  I'll listen to you the day I die or you go off air, but I'm going to do my part to make sure you don't have a great day.
[03:59:48.467 --> 03:59:54.350]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
