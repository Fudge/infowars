[00:00:07.568 --> 00:00:11.090]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.012]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, February 15th, 2024.
[00:00:14.072 --> 00:00:16.093]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.555]  Owen Schroer filling in for Alex today.
[00:00:18.635 --> 00:00:19.735]  And we are no...
[00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:44.847]  No shortage of news and information and content and excitement for you today.
[00:00:45.487 --> 00:00:54.454]  Let me lay out what we have coming up as far as the news is concerned and then what you can expect on the next four hours of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:55.415 --> 00:00:57.576]  Brought to you by InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:00:58.377 --> 00:01:01.940]  Right here at band.video.
[00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.943]  InfoWars.com slash show.
[00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:29.519]  You can find us at RealAlexJones back on Twitter, where we will also be doing a Twitter Spaces coming up later in the afternoon as well, with Harrison Smith and Chase Geiser joining me in studio, and then you potentially joining us on a Twitter Spaces.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.881]  And then Drew Hernandez hosting the fourth hour.
[00:01:35.558 --> 00:01:35.938]  We're good to go.
[00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:36.318]  We're good to go.
[00:02:05.154 --> 00:02:20.364]  And when you look at the history of Alvin Bragg, the district attorney in Manhattan, Soros funded, and when you look at what he did to even get this case to court, it shows you that the whole thing is corrupt from the very get-go.
[00:02:23.026 --> 00:02:30.631]  And this is all about the hush money to the hooker, Stormy Daniels.
[00:02:34.031 --> 00:02:37.572]  Or I guess she would say she's an adult film actress.
[00:02:37.652 --> 00:02:40.373]  Well, you're getting paid for a sexual act, so I don't know what the difference is.
[00:02:42.393 --> 00:02:48.515]  But she actually owes Trump $300,000 in a defamation case.
[00:02:49.555 --> 00:02:51.315]  So the whole thing is just completely screwy.
[00:02:52.396 --> 00:03:02.018]  Then you had the developments today in the Georgia case with Fannie Willis sleeping with the prosecuting attorneys
[00:03:03.736 --> 00:03:10.620]  And they had eyewitness testimony of personal friends saying, yep, they were in a romantic relationship in 2019.
[00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.381]  They lied about it in court filings.
[00:03:14.102 --> 00:03:15.002]  And I was watching that.
[00:03:15.022 --> 00:03:17.264]  I was glued to that this morning.
[00:03:18.704 --> 00:03:20.365]  And so there's some developments there.
[00:03:20.525 --> 00:03:22.547]  I think Fannie Willis is going to be out.
[00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:25.202]  It looks like she's going to be out.
[00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:40.632]  And then more information revealed as far as what went on in 2020 to get Biden to a record number of votes, which nobody really believes, if they're being honest, that Biden had more votes than Trump or a record number of votes, more votes than Obama, everything else.
[00:03:41.153 --> 00:03:42.894]  Then there's the cases against Biden.
[00:03:44.155 --> 00:03:44.575]  I don't know.
[00:03:44.995 --> 00:03:46.656]  Biden is pretty much cooked at this point.
[00:03:47.557 --> 00:03:53.361]  It really, I think the strategy now for Republicans has to be, do you even want to impeach Biden?
[00:03:56.215 --> 00:03:56.756]  We're good to go.
[00:04:11.624 --> 00:04:13.145]  I mean, you left him in there this long.
[00:04:13.485 --> 00:04:23.552]  Why not leave him in there, get all the evidence against himself and his crime family, and then just present that in October as the October surprise, and then just crush him in the general election?
[00:04:23.832 --> 00:04:28.015]  But if you remove Joe Biden from the equation, you're almost doing the Democrats a favor at this point.
[00:04:28.976 --> 00:04:30.837]  But there's more information on the Biden deal.
[00:04:32.028 --> 00:04:36.451]  Democrats coming for your Second Amendment in response to a Super Bowl parade shooting yesterday.
[00:04:36.471 --> 00:04:43.396]  But it's funny because they want to talk about the Super Bowl parade shooting, but they didn't talk about the latest school shootings or the latest church shootings.
[00:04:44.217 --> 00:04:45.398]  And, of course, we all know why.
[00:04:46.739 --> 00:04:53.203]  But let's talk national security coming up later today as well with Chase Geyser, Harrison Smith, and you on the Twitter spaces.
[00:04:53.804 --> 00:04:58.047]  Are they lying to us about Russian space nukes, or is this just a ploy to get more money from us?
[00:05:00.353 --> 00:05:01.253]  Hello, Americans.
[00:05:02.033 --> 00:05:03.694]  I want to share with you a story.
[00:05:04.294 --> 00:05:10.476]  A story about inflammation, the silent menace that lurks within our bodies, affecting our health and well-being.
[00:05:11.636 --> 00:05:17.438]  Inflammation, the root cause of countless ailments, quietly wreaking havoc over time.
[00:05:18.478 --> 00:05:26.120]  Long-term exposure to inflammation has been linked to a myriad of health issues, from heart disease to arthritis, even cognitive decline.
[00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:34.763]  But fear not, for there's a beacon of hope found in the wisdom of nature, a remedy that has stood the test of time, turmeric.
[00:05:35.555 --> 00:05:48.861]  And now I present to you Baudis from Infowarsstore.com, a powerful blend crafted with precision, boasting 95% curcuminoids extracted from turmeric.
[00:05:49.021 --> 00:05:50.961]  It's good for your heart, your brain, everything.
[00:05:51.081 --> 00:05:58.645]  It is 40% off, back in stock, Baudis Ultimate Turmeric Formula, Infowarsstore.com.
[00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.851]  Big Brother.
[00:06:11.311 --> 00:06:13.012]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:13.112 --> 00:06:14.232]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:14.993 --> 00:06:16.454]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:16.714 --> 00:06:17.834]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:18.354 --> 00:06:22.917]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:23.477 --> 00:06:26.539]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:28.440]  Alright, I just laid out the show.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.141]  We're good to go.
[00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:59.985]  And these are some of the biggest, most powerful radio stations that still exist, that still have a consistently large audience.
[00:07:01.927 --> 00:07:06.670]  But the parent company of them all was in $400 million of debt.
[00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:09.693]  So George Soros just purchased that.
[00:07:09.753 --> 00:07:10.913]  So more Soros control.
[00:07:11.454 --> 00:07:12.915]  And for them, it's not about money.
[00:07:13.636 --> 00:07:18.039]  When Bezos purchases the Washington Post...
[00:07:19.403 --> 00:07:26.267]  Or when the liberal billionaire purchases the Los Angeles Times and gives it to his radical liberal daughter and she runs it into the ground.
[00:07:26.527 --> 00:07:27.267]  It's not about money.
[00:07:27.307 --> 00:07:28.007]  It's about power.
[00:07:28.047 --> 00:07:29.608]  It's about influence, about narrative control.
[00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:33.130]  But we get picked up by a bunch of radio stations.
[00:07:34.291 --> 00:07:35.631]  We thank those radio stations.
[00:07:35.711 --> 00:07:39.833]  So let me relay out briefly what we have and then start digging into it.
[00:07:40.254 --> 00:07:43.095]  Huge news as far as the Trump legal front is concerned.
[00:07:43.475 --> 00:07:45.136]  The Biden legal front is confirmed.
[00:07:45.456 --> 00:07:46.497]  We're going to delve into that.
[00:07:47.998 --> 00:07:50.379]  The Democrats coming for your second amendment.
[00:07:50.579 --> 00:07:52.559]  And now they want to rewrite the Constitution.
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:14.324]  And maybe Gavin Newsom is making a play for the Democrat nominee in the presidential race because he's coming out about as hardcore as any Democrat ever has, not named fake Beto O'Rourke.
[00:08:15.822 --> 00:08:17.822]  As far as the rhetoric to take your guns.
[00:08:18.763 --> 00:08:23.443]  And this is all in response to a shooting at the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl parade.
[00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:25.964]  But we've watched.
[00:08:26.444 --> 00:08:27.784]  There have been school shootings.
[00:08:27.804 --> 00:08:28.884]  There have been church shootings.
[00:08:28.944 --> 00:08:30.225]  The mainstream media ignores them.
[00:08:30.265 --> 00:08:32.145]  The Democrats ignore them.
[00:08:32.165 --> 00:08:32.225]  Why?
[00:08:33.185 --> 00:08:35.626]  Because those shootings were done by leftists.
[00:08:35.886 --> 00:08:40.267]  Those shootings were done by leftist indoctrinated trans individuals.
[00:08:41.567 --> 00:08:42.147]  And they were...
[00:08:43.129 --> 00:08:46.590]  Directly targeted towards right-wingers and Christians.
[00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:55.311]  So they didn't cover those, but now that they got this Super Bowl parade shooting, they figured, hey, let's go ahead and use this for an opportunity to do some gun grabbing.
[00:08:56.292 --> 00:08:57.912]  So we'll talk about that.
[00:08:57.932 --> 00:09:00.232]  We're going to be joined.
[00:09:00.252 --> 00:09:04.313]  We're going to have a bit of an InfoWars roundtable today.
[00:09:04.473 --> 00:09:08.874]  Harrison Smith, myself, and Chase Geiser are all going to be in studio today.
[00:09:09.821 --> 00:09:17.362]  And I had already planned on this, and I had a brief meeting with Alex earlier this morning as he came into my office and said, hey, what are you going to do for today?
[00:09:17.402 --> 00:09:18.003]  What's the news?
[00:09:18.963 --> 00:09:26.804]  And we went through all of the news, and I said, I kind of want to do this InfoWars roundtable and talk about this national security threat and just have InfoWars and Chase in the studio.
[00:09:26.844 --> 00:09:29.565]  He said, that's a great idea, and then open up a Twitter X Spaces.
[00:09:30.865 --> 00:09:32.685]  So we're going to have an InfoWars roundtable.
[00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:36.426]  Then we're going to go into an X Spaces with this question.
[00:09:38.626 --> 00:09:42.929]  Because it's not just that I don't trust the intelligence communities.
[00:09:43.009 --> 00:09:43.609]  Why would I?
[00:09:43.689 --> 00:09:50.374]  I don't trust a boat with a 10-foot hole in the bottom of it.
[00:09:53.743 --> 00:09:54.783]  I think we're good to go.
[00:10:22.936 --> 00:10:29.240]  And even if we just reject everything the intelligence communities say, well, that puts us in a position to be played by them as well.
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.282]  Because then they could say something real and we ignore it.
[00:10:32.322 --> 00:10:33.763]  It becomes the boy-cried-wolf situation.
[00:10:34.543 --> 00:10:36.905]  So I think there's a real situation.
[00:10:37.505 --> 00:10:51.014]  When you have psychotic world leaders, when you have psychotic world leaders like Chuck Schumer, Joe Biden, Mitt Romney, Lindsey Graham, and the list goes on, that's a problem.
[00:10:52.073 --> 00:10:52.573]  That's a real threat.
[00:10:52.593 --> 00:10:53.814]  I know that's a real threat.
[00:10:53.834 --> 00:10:56.135]  I don't know if Russian space nukes are real or not.
[00:11:18.339 --> 00:11:18.939]  We're good to go.
[00:11:18.959 --> 00:11:19.099]  I think?
[00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:46.391]  And Putin says, we almost had peace.
[00:11:46.531 --> 00:11:47.632]  We had negotiations.
[00:11:47.672 --> 00:11:49.134]  We almost had a deal with Ukraine.
[00:11:49.935 --> 00:11:51.016]  The signatures were there.
[00:11:51.056 --> 00:11:52.117]  It was almost a done deal.
[00:11:52.157 --> 00:11:55.120]  And then Boris Johnson squashed it.
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.782]  And then Boris Johnson killed the deal.
[00:11:59.804 --> 00:12:06.151]  Well, this psychotic, after getting called out, this is how little they care.
[00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:09.940]  He doesn't put on a suit and tie.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.321]  He doesn't go in front of a podium.
[00:12:13.341 --> 00:12:15.302]  He doesn't go make an official press conference.
[00:12:16.303 --> 00:12:23.226]  Instead, he picks up his cell phone, puts it in selfie mode from his bathing suit at the beach.
[00:12:25.747 --> 00:12:27.168]  That's how unserious he is.
[00:12:27.368 --> 00:12:28.428]  That's how little they care.
[00:12:28.608 --> 00:12:30.109]  That's how psychotic they are.
[00:12:32.173 --> 00:12:41.679]  Boris Johnson just gets accused of killing a peace deal and causing hundreds of thousands to die in an unnecessary war, and he's too lazy.
[00:12:44.141 --> 00:12:51.286]  He shows he couldn't care less that he won't even take the time to pretend to care.
[00:12:51.626 --> 00:12:57.510]  He just fires up a selfie video from the beach in his bathing suit pretending to care in response.
[00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:59.311]  I mean, that is truly deranged.
[00:12:59.511 --> 00:13:00.732]  That is truly psychotic.
[00:13:02.708 --> 00:13:04.009]  That shows how little they care.
[00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:06.431]  They can't even fake it.
[00:13:06.491 --> 00:13:07.351]  They won't even try.
[00:13:09.953 --> 00:13:11.454]  But so we're going to get into this debate.
[00:13:12.135 --> 00:13:13.776]  What is the real national security threat?
[00:13:13.816 --> 00:13:15.017]  Is it Russian space nukes?
[00:13:16.278 --> 00:13:17.118]  Is it Iran?
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:20.421]  Is it the southern border?
[00:13:22.182 --> 00:13:24.123]  Is it our own psychotic leadership?
[00:13:26.525 --> 00:13:31.148]  So we'll be talking about that in studio, Chase Geyser, Harrison Smith, and then on a X...
[00:13:32.366 --> 00:13:34.527]  Formerly Twitter Spaces.
[00:13:36.787 --> 00:13:39.508]  But let's start with the legal issues.
[00:13:39.868 --> 00:13:40.648]  We'll start with Trump.
[00:13:40.708 --> 00:13:41.508]  We'll move on to Biden.
[00:13:44.489 --> 00:13:49.831]  Donald Trump's New York hush money trial will begin in 39 days with jury selection.
[00:13:52.331 --> 00:14:00.013]  And the Democrats are desperate to get all these trials moved forward as quickly as possible.
[00:14:00.033 --> 00:14:01.554]  In fact, Biden himself
[00:14:02.941 --> 00:14:04.262]  So all four of Trump's criminal cases...
[00:14:23.871 --> 00:14:31.277]  The Biden administration is trying to fast track and trying to speed race these ahead of the 2024 election.
[00:14:31.297 --> 00:14:33.138]  They have to get them done before the election.
[00:14:33.559 --> 00:14:34.960]  Because that's the entire purpose.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.361]  This isn't about justice.
[00:14:36.481 --> 00:14:37.642]  This is about destroying Trump.
[00:14:40.204 --> 00:14:42.105]  And, I mean, it's mainstream news now.
[00:14:45.688 --> 00:14:49.451]  This has been... It's been known.
[00:14:49.731 --> 00:14:51.773]  I reported on this a few weeks ago on The War Room.
[00:14:53.171 --> 00:15:01.973]  But it was kind of a, you know, we don't want the mainstream media getting a hold of this story, but they already do, so, I mean, it's not like I'm keeping anything from you.
[00:15:03.013 --> 00:15:08.214]  CNN, Trump's new Supreme Court gambit, doesn't even try to hide that it's a delay tactic.
[00:15:09.475 --> 00:15:12.415]  Trump asked Supreme Court for more time to appeal immunity ruling.
[00:15:12.835 --> 00:15:15.336]  So, okay, I mean, it's not like it was a big secret, but...
[00:15:16.475 --> 00:15:17.517]  It was their strategy.
[00:15:18.398 --> 00:15:18.979]  Now they get it.
[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:19.940]  Well, yeah.
[00:15:20.661 --> 00:15:24.787]  Of course, Trump's legal team strategy is to delay this as long as possible.
[00:15:25.227 --> 00:15:26.429]  Because there is no justice.
[00:15:28.351 --> 00:15:29.273]  There is no justice.
[00:15:31.476 --> 00:15:32.197]  And there's some other...
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:39.601]  There's some other things that are going on with this, too, behind the scenes that may or may not end up coming out.
[00:15:39.701 --> 00:15:49.243]  But it's all the larger picture that the Biden administration, the Democrats need to fast track these things, these four cases before the 2024 election.
[00:15:49.623 --> 00:15:55.624]  And so the Trump legal team strategy is to delay as long as possible, at least until after the election.
[00:15:55.784 --> 00:15:57.804]  I mean, so, yeah, that's the strategy.
[00:15:57.824 --> 00:15:58.525]  You figured it out.
[00:15:58.585 --> 00:15:59.125]  That's true.
[00:15:59.905 --> 00:16:00.585]  But of course it is.
[00:16:03.192 --> 00:16:04.434]  All of this is about the 2024 election.
[00:16:08.939 --> 00:16:20.285]  So yeah, for the same reason the Democrats and the Biden administration want all four of these cases concluded before the election is the same reason why the Trump legal team wants them delayed after the election.
[00:16:20.586 --> 00:16:22.006]  Because that's what this is about.
[00:16:22.046 --> 00:16:23.227]  This isn't about justice.
[00:16:23.267 --> 00:16:24.408]  This isn't about crimes.
[00:16:24.448 --> 00:16:26.909]  This isn't about anything other than the 2024 election.
[00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:28.070]  And everybody knows it.
[00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:29.871]  And it's the Democrats doing that.
[00:16:29.891 --> 00:16:33.513]  I mean, you want to talk about election meddling, they're the kings and queens of it.
[00:16:34.833 --> 00:16:35.514]  The Democrats.
[00:16:38.223 --> 00:16:47.030]  Now, Trump makes this statement dealing with one of the cases, how they lied about the value of Mar-a-Lago.
[00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:48.751]  I mean, it's so outrageous.
[00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:52.474]  In fact, guys, while I'm reading this, see if you can find the story.
[00:16:52.514 --> 00:16:53.835]  I think it was the New York Post.
[00:16:54.716 --> 00:16:55.737]  It came out a couple weeks ago.
[00:16:56.697 --> 00:17:05.845]  Largest... I think it's like the largest property value or highest value estate ever up on the Florida market goes up for sale.
[00:17:06.764 --> 00:17:09.165]  It was like $397 million or something.
[00:17:09.825 --> 00:17:10.606]  See if you can find that.
[00:17:10.646 --> 00:17:11.866]  I forget the keywords to search.
[00:17:12.666 --> 00:17:15.307]  It was like the most valuable property ever up on the Florida market.
[00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:16.948]  It was $397 million or something like that.
[00:17:17.608 --> 00:17:25.412]  Folks, this property that hits the market at nearly $400 million is a tenth the size of Mar-a-Lago.
[00:17:26.752 --> 00:17:27.072]  Look at that.
[00:17:27.112 --> 00:17:28.433]  The crew found it in less than 30 seconds.
[00:17:28.453 --> 00:17:28.753]  Here it is.
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.881]  Thank you.
[00:17:32.081 --> 00:17:38.002]  This $295 million Florida compound is the most expensive home for sale in America.
[00:17:40.383 --> 00:17:44.284]  And it's like the tenth the size of Mar-a-Lago.
[00:17:45.124 --> 00:17:45.704]  A tenth!
[00:17:46.805 --> 00:17:57.708]  And it doesn't have the ornate architecture and the tiles and everything flown in from all around the world and the underground base and compound and the history and everything else.
[00:17:59.597 --> 00:18:03.878]  And it's $300 million, but Mar-a-Lago's only worth $20!
[00:18:07.579 --> 00:18:10.180]  I mean, it's such a joke.
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:16.022]  It's such an offense to reality, but they don't even care.
[00:18:17.702 --> 00:18:18.363]  It's the same thing.
[00:18:18.443 --> 00:18:21.464]  Boris Johnson takes a selfie at the beach in his bathing suit.
[00:18:21.824 --> 00:18:23.744]  Oh, I didn't stop the peace deal.
[00:18:24.304 --> 00:18:26.125]  But you were too lazy to go have a real press conference.
[00:18:27.372 --> 00:18:27.952]  The Democrats.
[00:18:28.193 --> 00:18:29.493]  Trump lied about Mar-a-Lago.
[00:18:29.533 --> 00:18:30.794]  It's only worth $18 million.
[00:18:32.195 --> 00:18:37.979]  A property a tenth its size without the history and the significance on the market for $300 million.
[00:18:38.059 --> 00:18:41.281]  It's like, oh yeah, Mar-a-Lago's only worth $18 million.
[00:18:41.301 --> 00:18:42.742]  Yep, Democrats are honest people.
[00:18:43.202 --> 00:18:44.083]  So here's Trump's response.
[00:18:46.678 --> 00:18:47.078]  We're good to go.
[00:19:05.799 --> 00:19:07.520]  Who likes to take selfies of himself naked.
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.020]  I'm serious.
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.601]  I mean, he does look pretty good for an 80-year-old man.
[00:19:09.621 --> 00:19:10.721]  I'll give him that, but it's a little creepy.
[00:19:11.021 --> 00:19:13.763]  Wrongfully ruled against me before the trial even started.
[00:19:14.283 --> 00:19:20.406]  Said that Mar-a-Lago was only worth $18 million and was already overturned four times on appeal.
[00:19:20.886 --> 00:19:21.426]  A new record.
[00:19:21.766 --> 00:19:26.628]  This crooked judgment will be a dark and sad day for the justice system in the New York state.
[00:19:26.688 --> 00:19:27.889]  No damages, no victims.
[00:19:28.249 --> 00:19:28.909]  Only success.
[00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:30.990]  Case already won on appeal.
[00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:32.671]  Witch hunt, election interference.
[00:19:33.391 --> 00:19:34.772]  Trump posted that yesterday.
[00:19:35.071 --> 00:19:36.251]  Yesterday afternoon.
[00:19:36.371 --> 00:19:38.612]  And, you know, I got to say this real quick.
[00:19:40.353 --> 00:19:42.373]  Because this is a tip of the cap to the crew.
[00:19:43.934 --> 00:19:45.654]  This is a tip of the cap to the audience.
[00:19:46.654 --> 00:19:48.535]  This is a tip of the cap to Alex Jones.
[00:19:50.735 --> 00:19:52.616]  And I got to tell you, this kind of makes me feel good.
[00:19:52.636 --> 00:20:03.039]  Because, look, when you're in the business of fighting tyrants, when you're in the business of trying to destroy and expose evil, when you're in the business of trying to save America...
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.803]  And everything they're doing to Trump, they did to us first.
[00:20:10.304 --> 00:20:12.326]  I mean, folks, that's like getting an MVP award.
[00:20:13.387 --> 00:20:15.710]  So, yeah.
[00:20:16.751 --> 00:20:17.712]  They censored Donald Trump.
[00:20:17.752 --> 00:20:18.593]  They censored us first.
[00:20:19.053 --> 00:20:23.198]  Yeah, they had illegal rulings and judgments against Donald Trump.
[00:20:23.218 --> 00:20:24.840]  They did it to him first.
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.762]  So, I mean, it's not even like...
[00:20:27.978 --> 00:20:29.339]  Because it's a painful process.
[00:20:29.439 --> 00:20:30.599]  But, I mean, seriously.
[00:20:31.179 --> 00:20:32.320]  So, I mean, tip of the cap.
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.361]  Crew gets an MVP award.
[00:20:34.481 --> 00:20:35.881]  Alex Jones gets an MVP award.
[00:20:35.981 --> 00:20:38.622]  All of our guests get an MVP award.
[00:20:38.682 --> 00:20:40.723]  This audience gets an MVP award.
[00:20:41.444 --> 00:20:43.184]  This is the most valuable player in the game.
[00:20:44.605 --> 00:20:44.965]  Right here.
[00:20:47.846 --> 00:20:51.188]  So, I just got to take a second to recognize that.
[00:20:51.968 --> 00:20:53.809]  So, yeah, what they did to Alex Jones...
[00:20:54.935 --> 00:20:57.777]  In the court cases, oh, Alex Jones owes trillions of dollars.
[00:20:58.357 --> 00:21:00.359]  Just completely outrageous, completely illegal.
[00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:02.380]  Judgment before they could even show any evidence.
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:03.921]  Just completely denied in court.
[00:21:04.101 --> 00:21:06.223]  Judge says, nope, you're not allowed to say you're innocent.
[00:21:06.483 --> 00:21:07.984]  Nope, you're not allowed to have any discovery.
[00:21:08.024 --> 00:21:09.005]  Nope, no evidence, nothing.
[00:21:09.305 --> 00:21:10.065]  I rule against you.
[00:21:10.326 --> 00:21:11.426]  Now they decide how much money.
[00:21:15.169 --> 00:21:16.430]  And they just get to lie about everything.
[00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:18.751]  And then they, oh, Jones owns, he owes 500 billion.
[00:21:18.771 --> 00:21:19.252]  He owes 3 trillion.
[00:21:23.376 --> 00:21:26.397]  He owes the entire national debt, the entire GDP of France.
[00:21:28.098 --> 00:21:30.659]  So it's like, oh my gosh, wow, and now they're doing it to Trump?
[00:21:30.999 --> 00:21:34.120]  It's like, whoa, they really came for us first.
[00:21:35.241 --> 00:21:36.501]  This really is the most valuable player.
[00:21:36.701 --> 00:21:37.242]  But moving on.
[00:21:37.782 --> 00:21:39.403]  So here's Alvin Bragg's history.
[00:21:42.844 --> 00:21:49.947]  Now keep in mind, this case that Alvin Bragg, this hush money case that Alvin Bragg is hearing, was already rejected...
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.641]  By the previous district attorney, Cyrus Vance.
[00:21:57.262 --> 00:22:08.645]  And even if it was to move forward at that time, it was a misdemeanor, but it couldn't move forward because the statute of limitations had already ran out.
[00:22:09.666 --> 00:22:11.426]  Well, Alvin Bragg doesn't care about any of that.
[00:22:12.527 --> 00:22:13.567]  Statute of limitations?
[00:22:13.687 --> 00:22:14.367]  He doesn't care.
[00:22:16.708 --> 00:22:17.568]  It's a misdemeanor?
[00:22:17.728 --> 00:22:18.388]  He doesn't care.
[00:22:18.649 --> 00:22:19.709]  He's making it a felony.
[00:22:20.905 --> 00:22:22.345]  Last district attorney threw it out?
[00:22:22.625 --> 00:22:23.246]  He doesn't care.
[00:22:23.346 --> 00:22:24.166]  He's bringing it back.
[00:22:24.826 --> 00:22:26.806]  Who's got blackmail on Alvin Bragg?
[00:22:27.707 --> 00:22:29.127]  Or is he just this corrupt on his own?
[00:22:29.607 --> 00:22:41.250]  Woke district attorney Alvin Bragg, who's set to indict Trump as one of America's most controversial, most controversial, been massively criticized for his soft-on-crime policies.
[00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:42.210]  And boy, is he.
[00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:46.011]  Boy, is he soft-on-crime.
[00:22:48.865 --> 00:22:54.990]  But yet he once said he was afraid to ride the New York City subways because of how dangerous they are.
[00:22:56.251 --> 00:22:57.351]  Isn't that something?
[00:22:58.773 --> 00:23:00.053]  But he's soft on criminals.
[00:23:02.455 --> 00:23:08.760]  So he took what would have been a misdemeanor but the statute of limitations already ran out and made it a felony against Trump.
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:11.522]  But when you're a violent criminal in New York City, he does the opposite.
[00:23:12.303 --> 00:23:17.707]  Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has downgraded over half of felony cases to misdemeanors.
[00:23:18.956 --> 00:23:20.257]  Why do you think he's doing that?
[00:23:21.658 --> 00:23:24.179]  And then why would he do the opposite to Donald Trump?
[00:23:26.441 --> 00:23:29.963]  These stories are all over the internet about how bad Alvin Bragg is for New York City.
[00:23:30.303 --> 00:23:37.227]  Top 10 worst New York City criminals let go again and again by woke Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.
[00:23:37.247 --> 00:23:43.331]  And they get back on the streets and they beat and they stab and they kill and they rape thanks to Alvin Bragg.
[00:23:44.692 --> 00:23:47.974]  But he's going to get Donald Trump, isn't he?
[00:23:49.241 --> 00:23:49.622]  I don't know, but...
[00:24:04.713 --> 00:24:05.213]  We're good to go.
[00:24:05.233 --> 00:24:05.854]  I think?
[00:24:27.284 --> 00:24:28.565]  So this is going on all morning.
[00:24:29.125 --> 00:24:30.265]  It's very intriguing to watch.
[00:24:30.586 --> 00:24:33.927]  And then the arrogance of Nathan Wade up there as he's been caught lying.
[00:24:33.967 --> 00:24:46.813]  But he's a lawyer, and so lawyers as witnesses, they know how to talk and say the right things so that they can't really be told they're lying, but also they can't admit to any crimes that they know they committed.
[00:24:47.733 --> 00:24:49.114]  So that was going on all morning as well.
[00:24:51.752 --> 00:24:52.532]  We're good to go.
[00:24:52.573 --> 00:24:52.973]  We're good to go.
[00:25:22.526 --> 00:25:27.567]  That Willis had an affair with the prosecutor Nathan Wade, and it dates back to 2019.
[00:25:28.908 --> 00:25:31.529]  So there's all kinds of evidence against these two.
[00:25:31.549 --> 00:25:33.129]  They lied in court filings.
[00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:45.673]  And you had, while Wade was allegedly having the affair with Willis, I'm also wondering what Willis had to do to get that affair.
[00:25:45.753 --> 00:25:46.613]  I mean, seriously.
[00:25:46.673 --> 00:25:50.374]  I mean, you know, she ain't really a...
[00:25:53.729 --> 00:25:54.109]  I don't know.
[00:25:54.289 --> 00:25:56.610]  Maybe you're into pork chops.
[00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:02.032]  Maybe you're into big ol' sweet.
[00:26:02.073 --> 00:26:03.253]  But see, that's how it goes.
[00:26:03.473 --> 00:26:06.174]  Oh, hey, I'll pay for your travel.
[00:26:06.234 --> 00:26:07.395]  I'll give you these cases.
[00:26:07.455 --> 00:26:07.975]  I'll do this.
[00:26:08.035 --> 00:26:08.755]  I'll do that for you.
[00:26:08.795 --> 00:26:13.137]  But I just need you to scratch my back, if you know what I mean.
[00:26:16.098 --> 00:26:17.079]  So it could be that bad.
[00:26:17.539 --> 00:26:21.701]  But nonetheless, they got caught lying about their romantic relationship.
[00:26:22.677 --> 00:26:28.822]  They'd been involved in a romantic relationship as Willis was giving Wade all these cases.
[00:26:29.903 --> 00:26:36.529]  And they're trying to work around it by saying, well, this is all attorney-client privilege, so we don't have to talk about what was paid for or why.
[00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:40.313]  We don't have to talk about how many times we had sex or when or where.
[00:26:40.533 --> 00:26:41.934]  It's all attorney-client privilege.
[00:26:42.414 --> 00:26:46.098]  And that's the argument that they're making so that none of this ends up coming out in the courtroom.
[00:26:47.519 --> 00:26:47.999]  Pretty smart.
[00:26:48.019 --> 00:26:48.500]  I'll give them that.
[00:26:51.138 --> 00:26:52.479]  But yeah, they've been caught.
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.201]  Technofog following this as well.
[00:26:55.922 --> 00:26:57.523]  One of the great legal minds on Twitter.
[00:26:59.124 --> 00:27:07.010]  Witness claims that Fulton County District Attorney Fannie Willis started her romantic relationship with Nathan Wade in 2019.
[00:27:07.051 --> 00:27:11.814]  This contradicts the court filings of Wade-Willis that the relationship began in 2022.
[00:27:12.295 --> 00:27:13.976]  False statements to the court.
[00:27:14.516 --> 00:27:15.857]  Things are getting bad for Willis.
[00:27:16.878 --> 00:27:20.201]  The witness says, no doubt they were in a romantic relationship.
[00:27:23.484 --> 00:27:23.684]  Yeah.
[00:27:24.445 --> 00:27:26.246]  This is getting bad.
[00:27:26.286 --> 00:27:30.229]  And they thought that maybe they could get out of this by settling with the ex-wife.
[00:27:31.309 --> 00:27:32.130]  That's so fast.
[00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.851]  Not so good.
[00:27:32.871 --> 00:27:33.531]  All right.
[00:27:33.851 --> 00:27:36.593]  Quickly here on the Biden side of things.
[00:27:37.754 --> 00:27:39.035]  Now they're going back and forth.
[00:27:39.715 --> 00:27:45.299]  Biden slams Robert Herr for asking about his son Beau's death.
[00:27:45.539 --> 00:27:47.000]  Sources say Biden brought it up.
[00:27:47.381 --> 00:27:49.882]  So here's likely, I would say 99.9%.
[00:27:49.982 --> 00:27:50.663]  Here's how this goes down.
[00:27:53.416 --> 00:28:02.880]  Joe Biden loves to bring up the fact, which is not a fact, so really I should say, Joe Biden loves to bring up the lie that his son Beau died in Iraq.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.201]  He does it all the time.
[00:28:05.201 --> 00:28:05.721]  All the time.
[00:28:05.761 --> 00:28:12.444]  He calls up Gold Star families and says, well, it's all about me and my son dying in Iraq, even though his son died of cancer in New York.
[00:28:13.085 --> 00:28:15.005]  And even when he was overseas, he was just a lawyer.
[00:28:15.926 --> 00:28:19.988]  So Biden loves to have this stolen valor like his son was a soldier
[00:28:20.908 --> 00:28:21.469]  We're good to go.
[00:28:44.932 --> 00:28:48.233]  So he just starts bringing up, oh, I remember my poor son Bo died.
[00:28:48.293 --> 00:28:53.355]  I don't remember many dates, but I remember my poor son Bo died in Iraq.
[00:28:53.975 --> 00:28:56.376]  And then Biden says, how dare her bring that up?
[00:28:56.656 --> 00:28:58.516]  But it was actually Biden that brought it up, of course.
[00:28:59.376 --> 00:29:01.217]  But folks, we're standing up for our rights.
[00:29:01.237 --> 00:29:02.317]  We're standing up for your rights.
[00:29:02.357 --> 00:29:04.738]  We're standing up for all of our freedoms and our children.
[00:29:04.958 --> 00:29:12.621]  If you don't spread the word about the broadcast, if you don't share the links, if you don't buy products at InfoWarsHore.com, then I'm not griping at you.
[00:29:12.641 --> 00:29:13.721]  I'm just saying, what are you doing?
[00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:18.132]  Less than 1% of you ever buy a product at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:29:19.012 --> 00:29:26.915]  If just a half a percent more would go buy a book or a film or a t-shirt or get some of our great supplements and then reorder them because they really work, just try it.
[00:29:27.516 --> 00:29:29.457]  We would be able to do so many things.
[00:29:29.817 --> 00:29:33.599]  I'm praying to God that he'll touch your heart to decide to support us.
[00:29:34.119 --> 00:29:35.880]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:29:38.012 --> 00:29:38.672]  It's been sold out.
[00:29:38.732 --> 00:29:39.492]  It's back in stock.
[00:29:39.552 --> 00:29:40.753]  Reformulated even stronger.
[00:29:41.553 --> 00:29:43.414]  Nitric boost to clean out your blood and your whole body.
[00:29:43.874 --> 00:29:44.954]  Vasodilation.
[00:29:44.974 --> 00:29:47.355]  It's got a lot of wonderful side effects.
[00:29:47.375 --> 00:29:48.095]  And I mean good ones.
[00:29:48.475 --> 00:29:49.235]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:29:49.855 --> 00:29:50.736]  It is powerful.
[00:29:50.776 --> 00:29:51.716]  So be careful with it.
[00:29:52.056 --> 00:29:53.196]  Next level foundational energy.
[00:29:53.316 --> 00:29:55.977]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:02.252]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalist.
[00:30:02.612 --> 00:30:04.974]  And people can't identify who's a patriot and who isn't.
[00:30:05.294 --> 00:30:08.436]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalist.
[00:30:08.496 --> 00:30:11.398]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.
[00:30:11.638 --> 00:30:22.226]  That's why I designed this amazing 1776 red, white, and blue Gadsden flag shirt so you can support the InfoWar and meet like-minded people everywhere when you wear it.
[00:30:22.346 --> 00:30:27.974]  When you wear these shirts, it creates an amazing amount of energy, and it's quite the adventure.
[00:30:28.275 --> 00:30:32.541]  So get your 1776 shirt right now at Infowarsstore.com.

[00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:43.952]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is antithetical, the complete opposite of what the globalists are pushing.

[00:30:52.396 --> 00:30:56.197]  Spread the word, meet like-minded people, and fund the 1776 revolution worldwide.
[00:31:01.192 --> 00:31:02.452]  Gunther in Tennessee.
[00:31:02.492 --> 00:31:03.472]  Thanks for calling, Gunther.
[00:31:03.493 --> 00:31:04.033]  Hey, Alex.
[00:31:04.213 --> 00:31:04.953]  First time caller.
[00:31:05.053 --> 00:31:06.893]  Real quick, wanted to plug your foundational energy.
[00:31:07.453 --> 00:31:08.414]  Just started taking that.
[00:31:09.074 --> 00:31:13.395]  And, boy, three pills, recommended dose, I was bouncing off the walls.
[00:31:13.495 --> 00:31:19.136]  But I'll tell you, foundational is the right name for that product because I'll cut down to one.
[00:31:19.736 --> 00:31:23.957]  It's like you have a baseline of energy that you were missing before that you got back.
[00:31:24.397 --> 00:31:32.663]  Well, I'm glad you mentioned that because it's methylfolate, the breakdown of folic acid, and a lot of people, particularly Europeans, don't absorb all of the folic acid.
[00:31:32.903 --> 00:31:34.004]  So it's not a stimulant.
[00:31:34.224 --> 00:31:37.626]  It's a totally natural thing that boosts energy that's foundational.
[00:31:37.926 --> 00:31:40.488]  And was I lying to you or did it not work?
[00:31:41.169 --> 00:31:42.369]  No, it was top-notch.
[00:31:42.409 --> 00:31:46.032]  And I was actually taking Red Pill Plus before, and that's got a little folic acid in it.
[00:31:46.092 --> 00:31:49.875]  I think there was a little buildup from this, but the energy from this was no jitters.
[00:31:50.075 --> 00:31:51.115]  I mean, it's top-notch.
[00:31:51.135 --> 00:31:51.796]  It's a great product.
[00:31:52.216 --> 00:31:53.157]  Well, thank you so much.
[00:31:53.197 --> 00:31:53.537]  Yeah, no.
[00:31:53.637 --> 00:31:56.961]  Folic acid's great and it's in real red pill, but some can't break it down.
[00:31:57.001 --> 00:31:58.001]  This is the breakdown of it.
[00:31:58.082 --> 00:31:58.842]  That's exactly it.
[00:32:00.644 --> 00:32:03.767]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:32:03.787 --> 00:32:05.348]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:32:06.089 --> 00:32:09.152]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:32:10.033 --> 00:32:13.956]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers...
[00:32:15.393 --> 00:32:18.095]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:32:18.936 --> 00:32:26.742]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:32:27.757 --> 00:32:30.639]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:36.384]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:32:37.204 --> 00:32:38.105]  I know you spread the word.
[00:32:38.145 --> 00:32:39.626]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[00:32:39.646 --> 00:32:40.186]  Keep doing it.
[00:32:40.226 --> 00:32:46.851]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[00:32:47.272 --> 00:32:48.453]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[00:32:49.173 --> 00:32:52.817]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWars.com.
[00:32:53.457 --> 00:32:58.082]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWars.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:32:58.402 --> 00:32:59.263]  Please take action now.
[00:33:01.845 --> 00:33:07.731]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:11.691 --> 00:33:18.755]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:19.235 --> 00:33:21.776]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:33:21.836 --> 00:33:34.022]  Alright, more bombshells from the case in Fulton County where Fannie Willis and her relationship with Nathan Wade is being called into question.
[00:33:34.263 --> 00:33:35.143]  I can't believe this.
[00:33:36.023 --> 00:33:40.746]  I mean, I wouldn't say it's like I just predicted this and then it happened when I was on air.
[00:33:41.803 --> 00:33:42.263]  All I needed.
[00:33:42.283 --> 00:33:45.686]  You said in the affidavit that you roughly shared travel, though, correct?
[00:33:45.706 --> 00:33:45.786]  Yes.
[00:34:10.447 --> 00:34:13.168]  So this roughly sharing travel, you're saying she reimbursed you?
[00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:13.789]  She did.
[00:34:14.509 --> 00:34:17.351]  And where did you deposit the money she reimbursed you?
[00:34:17.371 --> 00:34:18.351]  It was cash.
[00:34:18.571 --> 00:34:19.992]  She didn't give me any checks.
[00:34:20.812 --> 00:34:23.414]  So she paid you cash for her share of all these vacations?
[00:34:23.434 --> 00:34:25.174]  Mr. Schaefer, you'll step out if you do that again.
[00:34:25.375 --> 00:34:25.715]  Yes, ma'am.
[00:34:26.075 --> 00:34:27.135]  Okay.
[00:34:27.155 --> 00:34:30.217]  And so all of the vacations that she took, she paid you cash for?
[00:34:30.237 --> 00:34:31.998]  Yes, ma'am.
[00:34:33.267 --> 00:34:40.174]  So there's Ashley Merchant, and that's Nathan Wade admitting he was paid in cash, or reimbursed in cash, by Willis for these vacations.
[00:35:00.418 --> 00:35:02.539]  Big Fat Fanny, who is that man sitting over there?
[00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:04.241]  Oh, that's my Bigelow!
[00:35:05.822 --> 00:35:13.027]  Yeah, he takes vacations with me and then I give him legal cases to handle and pay him cash for vacations.
[00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:17.091]  She's cooked!
[00:35:18.992 --> 00:35:19.673]  She's cooked.
[00:35:20.373 --> 00:35:21.374]  That pig is cooked.
[00:35:22.815 --> 00:35:23.255]  Smell that?
[00:35:24.576 --> 00:35:26.558]  Smells like bacon.
[00:35:28.447 --> 00:35:32.489]  I mean, this is outrageous.
[00:35:32.829 --> 00:35:35.250]  See, these are the people they have going after Trump.
[00:35:37.792 --> 00:35:49.338]  Willis, who's paying an attorney in cash for vacations in an affair they have, which might be even more nefarious than it appears now.
[00:35:51.699 --> 00:35:52.239]  This is crazy.
[00:35:52.619 --> 00:35:55.641]  Alvin Bragg, who lets all the criminals go in New York City.
[00:35:57.324 --> 00:36:04.387]  Judge Ingeron, who... I mean, I'll give him credit for a 70-year-old or whatever, however old he is, man.
[00:36:04.467 --> 00:36:05.747]  I mean, he looks good naked.
[00:36:05.827 --> 00:36:06.388]  I mean, you know.
[00:36:06.588 --> 00:36:11.269]  But he likes to take pictures of himself naked and upload them on the Internet so everybody can see how good he looks.
[00:36:14.071 --> 00:36:17.632]  E. Jean Carroll, a rat woman from the woods.
[00:36:17.912 --> 00:36:18.892]  I mean, this is just... Okay.
[00:36:21.894 --> 00:36:25.215]  I got to focus, but I mean... Oh...
[00:36:27.403 --> 00:36:31.592]  Like trying to stand up in a 500 mile an hour gust of winds.
[00:36:33.136 --> 00:36:33.897]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:35.836 --> 00:36:38.819]  Like I said earlier, this is the MVP.
[00:36:38.879 --> 00:36:39.900]  The crew is the MVP.
[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:41.621]  You in the audience are the MVPs.
[00:36:42.042 --> 00:36:43.743]  Our guests that we get on are the MVPs.
[00:36:43.763 --> 00:36:46.466]  We're going to have Harrison Smith and Chase Geiser in studio.
[00:36:46.506 --> 00:36:49.469]  You're going to be joining us on Twitter spaces, X spaces as well.
[00:36:49.509 --> 00:36:50.770]  We're the MVPs in this.
[00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:52.351]  Let's keep InfoWars going.
[00:36:52.732 --> 00:36:58.497]  Despite all the attacks against us, we're still standing thanks to your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:37:00.038 --> 00:37:00.799]  I'll say two things.
[00:37:01.159 --> 00:37:01.259]  One...
[00:37:02.563 --> 00:37:06.385]  I'm always honored, but my friends like to listen to my show.
[00:37:06.405 --> 00:37:12.849]  And if my friends can stand and listen to me for three hours a day talk politics, I hope that that means it's worth their time for you.
[00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:25.257]  But they call me and they say, it was specifically last Sunday, I'm hosting the show, and they say, all these callers keep complimenting you on your products.
[00:37:25.277 --> 00:37:26.318]  Do you tell them to do that?
[00:37:26.878 --> 00:37:27.839]  No, never.
[00:37:28.755 --> 00:37:31.196]  Never do we ever do that, not even once.
[00:37:31.236 --> 00:37:32.616]  We've never staged a caller.
[00:37:32.656 --> 00:37:34.537]  We've never told somebody to plug the products on the air.
[00:37:34.917 --> 00:37:36.577]  That's all organic promotion.
[00:37:37.158 --> 00:37:38.078]  The products really work.
[00:37:38.098 --> 00:37:39.018]  The supplements really work.
[00:37:39.538 --> 00:37:47.841]  I had a gentleman call in the next night, Monday night, talking about how he had joint pain, and he's up there in years.
[00:37:48.441 --> 00:37:54.583]  He's a veteran in joint pain and in his knees and his elbows, and he started taking bodies, and it was a massive relief factor.
[00:37:55.754 --> 00:38:05.602]  So that's a true story, and you can read all the five-star reviews at InfoWarsStore.com on the products like Bodies, which is back in stock and 40% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:38:06.703 --> 00:38:07.384]  But it's well-known.
[00:38:07.464 --> 00:38:09.665]  Turmeric is good for anti-inflammatory support.
[00:38:11.247 --> 00:38:22.356]  It's well-researched, well-studied, so we just go out and find the best source, the best quality turmeric, and then put as much of it, of the highest quality, into a supplement as possible.
[00:38:23.288 --> 00:38:24.949]  And we sell it at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:25.789]  It's bodies.
[00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:42.078]  Now, I still like to think young, but yet, you know, you get into your 30s and things don't recover as quickly and you kind of have to take a little more time to worry about stretching and inflammation and stuff.
[00:38:42.758 --> 00:38:43.898]  You're not in your 20s anymore.
[00:38:44.739 --> 00:38:46.180]  So even I will...
[00:38:47.082 --> 00:38:47.863]  We're good to go.
[00:39:08.359 --> 00:39:10.239]  Okay, so Joe Biden slams Robert Herr for asking about his dead son
[00:39:33.038 --> 00:39:38.190]  During the five-hour deposition where Biden claimed he didn't know who he was or where he was or what year it was or anything.
[00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:43.651]  And then he says, well, how dare he ask about my son, Beau?
[00:39:43.691 --> 00:39:45.792]  And, of course, it was Joe Biden that brought up Beau.
[00:39:46.352 --> 00:39:51.614]  Joe Biden loves to try to win sympathy points and distract from whatever's going on by bringing up his son, Beau.
[00:39:51.954 --> 00:39:54.274]  And then he lies and said that he died in Iraq.
[00:39:54.314 --> 00:39:54.734]  He didn't.
[00:39:54.815 --> 00:39:55.435]  That's a lie.
[00:39:55.675 --> 00:39:56.675]  Everybody knows it's a lie.
[00:39:56.915 --> 00:40:00.836]  Joe Biden has repeatedly told this lie so many times we've lost count.
[00:40:01.397 --> 00:40:05.638]  And there's no point in stopping the count now because he's going to lie about it and say it again.
[00:40:07.932 --> 00:40:10.775]  Probably before the end of the month he'll lie and say it again.
[00:40:10.795 --> 00:40:13.557]  Well, he's got other problems too.
[00:40:13.577 --> 00:40:14.879]  His whole family, actually.
[00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:22.872]  House Republicans probing whether Biden raided grandkids' bank accounts in unusual money transfers.
[00:40:23.732 --> 00:40:24.733]  So here's what's going on.
[00:40:25.613 --> 00:40:37.197]  And this is another big thing, because there's two issues I really want to focus on when we get the Infowars Knights of the Roundtable in here with Harrison Smith and Chase Geyser, and then we open up the X-Spaces, and that's the national security threat.
[00:40:37.517 --> 00:40:38.958]  What's the real national security threat?
[00:40:39.298 --> 00:40:39.978]  Is it Russia?
[00:40:40.018 --> 00:40:40.958]  Is it space nukes?
[00:40:41.318 --> 00:40:42.099]  Is it Iran?
[00:40:42.159 --> 00:40:42.959]  Is it the border?
[00:40:43.619 --> 00:40:44.520]  Is it Joe Biden?
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:45.340]  Is it Chuck Schumer?
[00:40:49.266 --> 00:40:54.428]  But at this point, Joe Biden has less than a year left in his presidency.
[00:40:56.970 --> 00:41:00.571]  Is impeaching Joe Biden now not doing the Democrats a favor?
[00:41:02.652 --> 00:41:05.814]  Wouldn't you rather run against Joe Biden than Gavin Newsom?
[00:41:07.375 --> 00:41:08.095]  I certainly would.
[00:41:09.596 --> 00:41:11.937]  Now, I understand justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[00:41:13.718 --> 00:41:15.619]  But sometimes you've got to think strategically.
[00:41:16.219 --> 00:41:18.360]  And maybe in this case you can have your cake and eat it too.
[00:41:19.904 --> 00:41:27.647]  Impeaching Joe Biden before the 2024 election, I think, is bad political strategy.
[00:41:27.747 --> 00:41:30.789]  You've already let him go this far, but let's be clear.
[00:41:31.749 --> 00:41:36.211]  Folks, the Republicans have all of the bank account information, and they're only getting more.
[00:41:37.652 --> 00:41:43.674]  They know Hunter Biden was flagged multiple times for possibly criminal bank transactions.
[00:41:44.054 --> 00:41:44.855]  This is all on record.
[00:41:45.649 --> 00:41:46.190]  We're good to go.
[00:41:58.769 --> 00:42:00.790]  Joe Biden taking money, pay for play.
[00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:03.192]  Hunter Biden as the rat hole, the bad man.
[00:42:03.532 --> 00:42:04.032]  They're caught.
[00:42:04.072 --> 00:42:04.833]  They're dead to rights.
[00:42:05.153 --> 00:42:10.096]  And then there's probably at least five other members of the Biden family that were also involved in this.
[00:42:10.356 --> 00:42:12.417]  Now, they might not have those bank records yet.
[00:42:12.817 --> 00:42:21.042]  They're probably going to get them because they now have suspicious transactions from Joe Biden's bank accounts linking to the other family members' bank accounts.
[00:42:21.262 --> 00:42:22.203]  So they have all of this.
[00:42:23.891 --> 00:42:24.632]  Biden is cooked.
[00:42:24.772 --> 00:42:29.695]  But the question now to me is, is it even worth impeaching Joe Biden at this point?
[00:42:30.075 --> 00:42:31.316]  I don't think so.
[00:42:31.416 --> 00:42:34.418]  I think you run the gambit on these investigations.
[00:42:34.458 --> 00:42:35.779]  You get as much evidence as possible.
[00:42:35.839 --> 00:42:36.759]  Forget about impeachment.
[00:42:37.159 --> 00:42:39.521]  And then in October, you just present all the evidence.
[00:42:41.822 --> 00:42:43.604]  Or you could wait until September.
[00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:48.176]  After the Democrats nominate Joe Biden or not.
[00:42:48.357 --> 00:42:50.480]  But see, this is the game that we're playing.
[00:42:51.322 --> 00:42:53.245]  I think there's no point in impeaching at this point.
[00:42:53.586 --> 00:42:57.974]  I think you wait until after the Democrats make their decision of who their nominee is going to be.
[00:43:00.089 --> 00:43:00.729]  I'm not perfect.
[00:43:00.749 --> 00:43:01.529]  I'm under a lot of stress.
[00:43:01.569 --> 00:43:05.790]  But if I didn't have the supplements we have and promote, I wouldn't be able to continue to be on air.
[00:43:06.371 --> 00:43:14.492]  And when you go to InfoWarsStore.com, you are funding the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists in an operation that the enemy admits has been the most effective at exposing them.
[00:43:14.693 --> 00:43:16.293]  Because we're fearless and we don't back down.
[00:43:16.653 --> 00:43:17.673]  We got God on our side.
[00:43:17.933 --> 00:43:19.454]  But God needs to work through you.
[00:43:19.794 --> 00:43:23.795]  You've got to make the decision to get great products you already need at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:43:23.855 --> 00:43:25.095]  And that is a 360 win.
[00:43:25.695 --> 00:43:28.656]  Nitric Boost, without even knowing, became our number three bestseller.
[00:43:29.336 --> 00:43:30.938]  Because people loved it so much.
[00:43:30.958 --> 00:43:31.898]  They had such great effects.
[00:43:32.219 --> 00:43:38.363]  Got all these natural compounds that clean out the blood, open up your arteries and veins, the capillaries, clean out your heart, your brain, everything.
[00:43:39.184 --> 00:43:40.926]  Well, we got an even better manufacturer.
[00:43:40.946 --> 00:43:45.769]  The other one was great, but one that's even better with even higher quality ingredients at a lower price.
[00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:49.152]  So I could never offer nitric boosts.
[00:43:49.192 --> 00:43:50.633]  It cost us so much to make.
[00:43:51.473 --> 00:43:53.675]  And now we can offer it for 40% off.
[00:43:54.235 --> 00:43:58.018]  Infowarsstore.com nitric boosts finally back in stock.
[00:43:58.038 --> 00:43:59.659]  40% off out of the gates.
[00:44:00.079 --> 00:44:03.802]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[00:44:04.122 --> 00:44:07.304]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[00:44:07.685 --> 00:44:12.148]  Because they can't get through this giant megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[00:44:12.788 --> 00:44:14.910]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:23.195]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's You Will Eat the Bugs.
[00:44:23.816 --> 00:44:29.580]  This is The Great Awakening, the plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second Great Renaissance.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:33.582]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[00:44:33.843 --> 00:44:36.364]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.
[00:44:36.705 --> 00:44:38.446]  Get your copy of The Great Awakening.

[00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:11.830]  Hey, what's better?
[00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:12.430]  Knockout?
[00:45:12.791 --> 00:45:13.371]  What's better?
[00:45:14.132 --> 00:45:14.592]  Down and out?
[00:45:14.872 --> 00:45:15.332]  What's better?
[00:45:15.392 --> 00:45:16.994]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[00:45:17.674 --> 00:45:22.598]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[00:45:23.286 --> 00:45:26.870]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:28.572]  That's how our bodies work.
[00:45:28.592 --> 00:45:29.553]  They're all very diverse.
[00:45:29.893 --> 00:45:40.084]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night Sleep.

[00:45:46.408 --> 00:45:50.591]  And it's in stock, available right now, of 25% off out of the gates.

[00:45:52.872 --> 00:45:54.954]  Good night's sleep today at InfoWars.com.
[00:45:59.921 --> 00:46:03.445]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[00:46:03.846 --> 00:46:10.874]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[00:46:11.034 --> 00:46:13.036]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[00:46:13.217 --> 00:46:14.278]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[00:46:14.298 --> 00:46:15.019]  He loved the idea.
[00:46:15.339 --> 00:46:18.860]  What would you call the debate and discussion about a pro-human future?
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:19.761]  Just Team Humanity?
[00:46:19.821 --> 00:46:20.701]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[00:46:20.861 --> 00:46:21.301]  Absolutely.
[00:46:21.621 --> 00:46:23.022]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[00:46:23.082 --> 00:46:26.523]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[00:46:26.743 --> 00:46:34.186]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to give InfoWars on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[00:46:34.466 --> 00:46:46.172]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a revolution against the globalists and it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[00:46:46.472 --> 00:46:47.772]  We're told humans are the problem.
[00:46:47.812 --> 00:46:48.813]  We're told we're killing the Earth.
[00:46:49.073 --> 00:46:53.335]  We're told all this garbage so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[00:46:53.655 --> 00:46:54.355]  We're not going to do that.
[00:46:54.616 --> 00:46:59.238]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[00:47:01.727 --> 00:47:07.632]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:30.504 --> 00:47:37.746]  I kind of dreamed this idea up a week or so ago, and I said, we need to have an InfoWars Knights of the Roundtable discussion.
[00:47:38.206 --> 00:47:39.026]  And now here we are.
[00:47:39.046 --> 00:47:41.186]  Owen Schroer hosting the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:41.587 --> 00:47:44.667]  Chase Geyser to my right, Harrison Smith to my left.
[00:47:44.847 --> 00:47:47.948]  I guess the only voice missing would be Alex Jones, but who knows?
[00:47:48.028 --> 00:47:51.569]  Maybe he gets involved later on the X Spaces.
[00:47:52.349 --> 00:47:54.751]  Now we're going to be launching in about 15 minutes.
[00:47:54.911 --> 00:47:58.994]  You can join us there, and then we're even going to be taking speakers at about 12.30.
[00:47:59.154 --> 00:48:04.698]  Here are the topics for discussion here on the InfoWars Nights of the Roundtable.
[00:48:04.718 --> 00:48:11.123]  We're going to be talking about what is the real national security threat, because now you have Congress saying, oh, national security threat, national security threat.
[00:48:11.244 --> 00:48:16.748]  Oh, as the American people are sick of giving hundreds of billions of dollars to foreign countries, now you're talking about Russian space nukes.
[00:48:17.288 --> 00:48:18.368]  Oh, I'm sure that's convenient.
[00:48:18.408 --> 00:48:20.229]  But I think there's a real level of concern there.
[00:48:20.249 --> 00:48:21.549]  But what's the real national security threat?
[00:48:21.569 --> 00:48:24.310]  Russia, Iran, our southern border, our own psychotic leadership.
[00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:25.310]  We'll talk about that.
[00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:32.071]  But maybe in this first segment, let's kind of carry over the Republican strategy with Joe Biden.
[00:48:32.992 --> 00:48:34.792]  Should the Republicans impeach Joe Biden?
[00:48:34.872 --> 00:48:39.073]  At this point, would it not be doing the Democrats a favor to get rid of Joe Biden?
[00:48:39.932 --> 00:48:40.472]  We're good to go.
[00:49:03.088 --> 00:49:05.389]  Let's bring in Harrison Smith on this.
[00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:08.371]  So what do you think the strategy should be here from Republicans?
[00:49:08.391 --> 00:49:15.735]  Do you agree, disagree that impeaching him and trying to remove him before the DNC in August would be doing the Democrats a favor?
[00:49:16.625 --> 00:49:17.626]  I think that's an interesting take.
[00:49:17.646 --> 00:49:27.791]  My initial response is to say impeach because I'm just desperate for some action from Republicans on any front because they're just such losers and they never do anything.
[00:49:27.831 --> 00:49:30.833]  So it's almost like at least put them on the back foot.
[00:49:31.053 --> 00:49:34.495]  At least be on the offensive against your enemies.
[00:49:35.155 --> 00:49:41.399]  But then when it comes to the election and whether you want to give them the excuse to get rid of Joe Biden or not, but I don't know.
[00:49:41.419 --> 00:49:45.441]  Apparently the Democrats repeatedly tell us that not only is Joe Biden not impeached,
[00:49:46.041 --> 00:49:46.982]  We're good to go.
[00:50:09.614 --> 00:50:10.316]  We're good to go.
[00:50:19.358 --> 00:50:23.241]  But as you point out, with the election coming up, this could be a gift to Democrats.
[00:50:23.301 --> 00:50:24.262]  So I don't know.
[00:50:24.382 --> 00:50:25.984]  I think I'm leaning more towards your way.
[00:50:26.104 --> 00:50:27.245]  Keep the investigations going.
[00:50:28.206 --> 00:50:29.367]  Give the dirt to the media.
[00:50:30.928 --> 00:50:36.853]  Screw him over for the 2024 election rather than try to get him out of office two months before it would happen anyway.
[00:50:36.933 --> 00:50:40.917]  But Joe Biden plays golf even if he smacks the ball off the rock and almost hits himself in the face.
[00:50:41.017 --> 00:50:44.440]  And Joe Biden rides a bike even though he falls in front of the media on it.
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:45.561]  Chase, what's your take?
[00:50:46.101 --> 00:50:48.023]  Yeah, so a couple of things.
[00:50:48.063 --> 00:50:49.644]  I don't think you have to choose one or the other.
[00:50:49.664 --> 00:50:54.769]  Remember, the Democrats, I believe, attempted to impeach Trump after the last election.
[00:50:54.809 --> 00:50:58.853]  So between the November election and the January 20th inauguration of Biden.
[00:50:58.873 --> 00:51:02.536]  So if I had it my way, I don't understand why we would
[00:51:03.237 --> 00:51:03.957]  We're good to go.
[00:51:25.868 --> 00:51:35.291]  And then after November 5th, when the election takes place, regardless of whether Joe Biden wins or loses the election, I think they should move forward with an impeachment so they can get their tit-for-tat for what the Democrats did to Trump the last time.
[00:51:35.591 --> 00:51:39.333]  I would say the only difference would be that Biden will lose voters.
[00:51:39.853 --> 00:51:42.634]  All the impeachment stuff against Trump, he didn't lose any voters.
[00:51:42.994 --> 00:51:44.074]  Biden will lose voters.
[00:51:44.114 --> 00:51:45.835]  And then the other angle is Biden is actually guilty.
[00:51:46.175 --> 00:51:47.175]  Trump was not guilty.
[00:51:47.495 --> 00:51:49.396]  So I think that those are the two differences there.
[00:51:49.956 --> 00:51:51.897]  But so you don't think it would be more strategic...
[00:51:52.617 --> 00:51:54.678]  To do it before the election?
[00:51:54.999 --> 00:52:00.982]  So, like, if the Democrats do nominate Joe Biden, you don't think it would be like, okay, they're running with him, let's destroy him now?
[00:52:01.423 --> 00:52:02.363]  That might be reasonable.
[00:52:02.443 --> 00:52:10.548]  My concern is that if we impeach too quickly, the Democrats will use that as an excuse or that will fuel the Democrats' desire to replace Biden.
[00:52:10.588 --> 00:52:14.851]  So what I don't want to have happen is some sort of impeachment come forward and the Democrats say, all right, he's getting impeached.
[00:52:15.171 --> 00:52:15.971]  Yeah, I don't know because...
[00:52:28.004 --> 00:52:28.564]  We're good to go.
[00:52:28.584 --> 00:52:28.784]  I think?
[00:52:51.249 --> 00:52:52.110]  I think you're right.
[00:53:13.749 --> 00:53:20.435]  Well, again, the other thing to me is just keeping Biden in a response position on the back foot.
[00:53:20.856 --> 00:53:23.398]  You know, he's having to run a campaign, I guess.
[00:53:23.538 --> 00:53:24.279]  I mean, who knows?
[00:53:24.359 --> 00:53:26.261]  He's probably laying on the beach somewhere right now.
[00:53:26.301 --> 00:53:29.544]  I mean, the man doesn't actually do anything, so maybe it doesn't actually matter that much.
[00:53:29.844 --> 00:53:30.405]  We're good to go.
[00:53:30.425 --> 00:53:30.645]  I think?
[00:53:49.806 --> 00:53:50.547]  Millennia, you know.
[00:53:50.807 --> 00:53:52.947]  Yeah, yeah, they're trying to send him to jail for a thousand years.
[00:53:52.967 --> 00:53:59.750]  Even if Trump can upload himself to the future technology and live for a thousand years, they'll still make sure that Trump's AI brain is in jail.
[00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:10.115]  Yeah, so it's been extremely effective at keeping Trump distracted and impotent on the political stage, and an impeachment would have that effect.
[00:54:11.255 --> 00:54:16.157]  Biden and his team would have to be focused on defending themselves rather than focusing on the campaign.
[00:54:16.197 --> 00:54:18.198]  So in that way, it would hobble him somewhat.
[00:54:18.638 --> 00:54:25.823]  You know what's funny though, Chase, is that Trump has still campaigned more than Biden, even though Trump is defending himself in these four cases.
[00:54:26.784 --> 00:54:31.687]  So, I mean, I guess the other angle of this is, what is the American media going to do?
[00:54:31.707 --> 00:54:39.433]  I feel like some of the American media, not the Rachel Maddows of the world, they'll always carry water for the Democrats and they'll never be enough.
[00:54:39.873 --> 00:54:42.475]  But I feel like some of the American media is getting sick of this.
[00:54:42.495 --> 00:54:44.196]  They're sick of covering for Joe Biden.
[00:54:44.516 --> 00:54:46.378]  It's embarrassing, quite frankly.
[00:54:47.236 --> 00:54:50.258]  Yeah, so there are a couple different angles as you bring that up.
[00:54:51.079 --> 00:54:57.183]  The first thing is we know that the American mainstream media, whether it's right-wing or left-wing, is sort of a product of the intelligence community.
[00:54:57.203 --> 00:55:06.709]  So that's a weapon that they've used ever since Operation Mockingbird after the Red Scare to sort of infiltrate and make sure that they have control over the narrative and the psychological response of the people.
[00:55:08.551 --> 00:55:11.294]  Really, when you're looking at the media, you're not looking at genuine opinions.
[00:55:11.314 --> 00:55:14.778]  You're looking at what the intelligence community wants you to hear and wants you to see.
[00:55:14.798 --> 00:55:24.950]  But the second thing I want to mention, just now that you bring up the mainstream media, because we talk about this a lot, is I think it's one of the features of our millennial generation that we...
[00:55:25.911 --> 00:55:26.531]  We're good to go.
[00:55:44.219 --> 00:55:46.821]  That they matter anymore to the extent that they once did.
[00:55:46.861 --> 00:55:52.324]  But psychologically, these legacy brands are so engraved in our head that we see them as credible.
[00:55:52.364 --> 00:55:54.005]  Oh, if it's in the New York Times, that means it's important.
[00:55:54.085 --> 00:55:55.726]  Even though no one reads the New York Times anymore.
[00:55:56.046 --> 00:55:57.587]  Oh, if CNN says it, that means it's important.
[00:55:57.647 --> 00:56:01.490]  Even though Larry King's been dead for years and no one actually really watches CNN anymore.
[00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:05.692]  Half their ratings are from just random businesses and airports having it on screen all day.
[00:56:05.732 --> 00:56:11.436]  So I think that what we need to do is really psychologically understand that...
[00:56:12.356 --> 00:56:14.777]  The war against mainstream media is one.
[00:56:14.797 --> 00:56:18.817]  The only strength that they have is the perception of their strength.
[00:56:19.958 --> 00:56:32.980]  In the show Chernobyl, when Gorbachev is talking about the Soviet Union trying to keep Chernobyl a secret from the international community, he says our power comes from the perception of our power because the Soviet Union was collapsing and constantly struggling.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.441]  It's the same thing with the mainstream media.
[00:56:34.461 --> 00:56:35.481]  They're actually powerless.
[00:56:35.961 --> 00:56:38.521]  They only have power because we believe that they do.
[00:56:38.561 --> 00:56:41.262]  I think we should just not care anymore what they say.
[00:56:41.502 --> 00:56:41.942]  Alex Jones Show!
[00:56:58.211 --> 00:57:05.957]  Like 20% have a cell phone, and maybe we're at like the 35-40%, but still I think 55-60% are still on that landline.
[00:57:06.737 --> 00:57:11.661]  Because here's the thing, you still have a large generation of Americans that aren't on social media.
[00:57:11.921 --> 00:57:16.524]  I mean, a lot of people that are above 50-60, they're still out there.
[00:57:16.564 --> 00:57:17.685]  They're not really on social media.
[00:57:17.705 --> 00:57:18.286]  So I think that...
[00:57:19.286 --> 00:57:21.207]  The playing field is definitely shifting.
[00:57:21.308 --> 00:57:23.028]  The teeter-totter is definitely shifting.
[00:57:23.389 --> 00:57:27.991]  In 10 years, for sure, alternative social media will completely replace the legacy media.
[00:57:28.472 --> 00:57:30.873]  But I don't think we're quite there yet.
[00:57:31.073 --> 00:57:31.433]  I don't know.
[00:57:31.453 --> 00:57:33.014]  Especially not in the halls of power.
[00:57:33.094 --> 00:57:33.815]  The D.C.
[00:57:34.055 --> 00:57:36.876]  power brokers, they do care what the MSNBC people say.
[00:57:36.896 --> 00:57:38.097]  They're kind of obsessed with it.
[00:57:38.137 --> 00:57:39.718]  Yeah, they give it a lot of weight.
[00:57:40.278 --> 00:57:42.059]  All right, Chase Geiser, Harrison Smith in studio.
[00:57:42.099 --> 00:57:46.802]  By the way, you're going to be able to weigh in on all of this on a Twitter X Spaces coming up shortly as well.

[00:58:02.771 --> 00:58:03.872]  I'm just saying, what are you doing?
[00:58:04.953 --> 00:58:08.236]  Less than 1% of you ever buy a product at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:09.133 --> 00:58:16.120]  If just a half a percent more would go buy a book or a film or a t-shirt or get some of our great supplements and then reorder them because they really work.
[00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:17.021]  Just try it.

[00:58:38.616 --> 00:58:39.357]  I'm going to leave it at that.

[01:00:09.649 --> 01:00:13.152]  Chase, how can people get in, listen in, and become a part of the show?

[01:00:25.784 --> 01:00:26.225]  So just go to
[01:00:26.485 --> 01:00:26.965]  We're good to go.
[01:00:55.743 --> 01:00:56.164]  We're good to go.
[01:01:19.907 --> 01:01:24.210]  And I'm... What's also strange about this, it's like we can't get any information on the shooter somehow.
[01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:25.150]  I don't know what that's about.
[01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:27.011]  But, I mean, it's so obvious, Harrison.
[01:01:27.031 --> 01:01:30.914]  They don't want to talk about their shooters, but now they're like, well, we still hate the Second Amendment, so we'll use this one.
[01:01:31.334 --> 01:01:41.900]  Yeah, well, this is a little bit different than what you would typically think of as like a mass shooting where you've got some lone gunman going into a school or going into a public place and just opening fire on random people just to kill people.
[01:01:42.261 --> 01:01:42.461]  You know...
[01:01:43.161 --> 01:01:43.621]  We're good to go.
[01:02:04.431 --> 01:02:05.451]  I agree, them and everyone else.
[01:02:05.491 --> 01:02:05.751]  No heroism.
[01:02:32.959 --> 01:02:35.982]  Honestly, to do that, who knows how many lives they saved.
[01:02:36.022 --> 01:02:39.845]  But again, I think it's less of your typical mass shooting.
[01:02:39.865 --> 01:02:45.450]  I hate that that's even a phrase, but there's mass shootings where people go out and just try to murder as many people as possible.
[01:02:45.810 --> 01:02:51.835]  And then there's just the relentless gun crime that plagues American cities that in this case happened to break out in the middle of a giant crowd.
[01:02:51.895 --> 01:02:53.536]  So horrifying, terrifying.
[01:02:53.576 --> 01:02:59.001]  Again, just another sort of data point in the decline and fall of a once great country called America.
[01:02:59.482 --> 01:03:01.184]  Well, and there's all kinds of gang activity.
[01:03:01.244 --> 01:03:04.868]  Specifically, you look at the west side of Kansas City.
[01:03:05.488 --> 01:03:10.273]  And so there was also an Operation Chase that Trump launched that Biden canceled immediately.
[01:03:10.854 --> 01:03:14.177]  And that was the task force to stop gang activity.
[01:03:14.197 --> 01:03:16.059]  I believe it was called Operation Legend.
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:21.045]  And immediately when Biden shut it down, gang shootings skyrocketed.
[01:03:21.718 --> 01:03:30.580]  I'm not familiar with the intricacies or the details of Operation Legend, but one thing that comes to mind, given the discussion about legislation around
[01:03:31.772 --> 01:03:32.212]  We're good to go.
[01:03:52.532 --> 01:03:58.817]  I mean, it's like this perpetual argument from the left about new regulation and then the bounce back from the right.
[01:03:59.477 --> 01:04:02.179]  It's going to violate rights and it's not going to actually accomplish anything.
[01:04:02.299 --> 01:04:06.222]  But when push comes to shove, if criminals want guns, they're going to get guns.
[01:04:06.242 --> 01:04:08.884]  I mean, the cartel is incredibly well armed and I believe there's like...
[01:04:09.184 --> 01:04:09.985]  We're good to go.
[01:04:30.444 --> 01:04:35.765]  Well, and also, I just like logical consistency, and if it doesn't have logical consistency, it's propaganda.
[01:04:36.225 --> 01:04:41.227]  So we see death, killings, shootings in the Middle East or Ukraine, and what's the U.S.
[01:04:41.347 --> 01:04:42.087]  government's response?
[01:04:42.367 --> 01:04:43.307]  Send them guns!
[01:04:43.427 --> 01:04:44.527]  Send them more guns!
[01:04:44.908 --> 01:04:49.329]  But then there's crime in the American metropolitan areas, and it's, take their guns!
[01:04:49.549 --> 01:04:50.509]  Take their guns!
[01:04:50.629 --> 01:04:51.469]  So, I mean, okay.
[01:04:51.909 --> 01:04:53.210]  Well, I know logical consistency.
[01:04:53.450 --> 01:04:54.070]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:54.110 --> 01:04:54.750]  Short break here.
[01:04:54.770 --> 01:04:58.551]  I hope you're joining us on X. You'll be able to weigh in there later, coming up in 30 minutes.
[01:05:00.128 --> 01:05:01.029]  Hello Americans.
[01:05:01.809 --> 01:05:03.451]  I want to share with you a story.
[01:05:04.071 --> 01:05:10.356]  A story about inflammation, the silent menace that lurks within our bodies, affecting our health and well-being.
[01:05:11.417 --> 01:05:17.222]  Inflammation, the root cause of countless ailments, quietly wreaking havoc over time.
[01:05:18.263 --> 01:05:25.929]  Long-term exposure to inflammation has been linked to a myriad of health issues, from heart disease to arthritis, even cognitive decline.
[01:05:26.946 --> 01:05:34.521]  But fear not, for there's a beacon of hope found in the wisdom of nature, a remedy that has stood the test of time, turmeric.
[01:05:35.333 --> 01:05:48.640]  And now I present to you Baudis from Infowarsstore.com, a powerful blend crafted with precision, boasting 95% curcuminoids extracted from turmeric.
[01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:50.741]  It's good for your heart, your brain, everything.

[01:06:01.049 --> 01:06:03.350]  The program leftists failed to silence.
[01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:05.511]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:29.448 --> 01:06:31.229]  Or maybe Putin has good taste in music.
[01:06:31.969 --> 01:06:34.290]  Or maybe if you don't like ACDC, there's something wrong with you.
[01:06:34.730 --> 01:06:35.910]  But that's a debate for another day.
[01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:38.211]  I think they're about to go on tour.
[01:06:38.231 --> 01:06:42.672]  These guys are going to literally rise from the crypt and start playing the guitar.
[01:06:42.692 --> 01:06:45.753]  All right, we've got Chase Geyser, Harrison Smith in studio.
[01:06:45.913 --> 01:06:48.354]  You might call it the Knights of the Infowars Roundtable here.
[01:06:48.874 --> 01:06:59.877]  We're also live on Twitter X Spaces, and we're going to open this debate up for the audience coming up in 30 minutes, the national security debate and should Republicans impeach Biden.
[01:07:00.118 --> 01:07:10.081]  And maybe we'll lean into that on the Twitter space, but you'll be able to open up your mics and speak with us on the Twitter X Space coming up here in about 30 minutes.
[01:07:10.501 --> 01:07:13.002]  Guys, let's talk about this national security issue now.
[01:07:13.582 --> 01:07:15.362]  And there's all kinds of stories.
[01:07:15.382 --> 01:07:16.983]  Let me just run down this quick...
[01:07:17.603 --> 01:07:18.365]  List of headlines.
[01:07:18.765 --> 01:07:22.513]  Trump meets with Tulsi Gabbard over how to run DOD in second term.
[01:07:22.593 --> 01:07:23.234]  I like that.
[01:07:23.615 --> 01:07:25.098]  Tulsi Gabbard anti-war.
[01:07:25.278 --> 01:07:28.384]  I like Trump reaching across the aisle, even though she left the Democrat Party.
[01:07:29.246 --> 01:07:30.007]  We're good to go.
[01:07:49.930 --> 01:08:02.636]  Lindsey Graham's about-face on Ukraine shows GOP patient with Kiev regime has run out or Lindsey Graham knows it's an election year and the American people are sick of funding this war and he's probably already made enough money off of his stocks that he's doing an about-face.
[01:08:02.677 --> 01:08:07.039]  But no, I would expect Lindsey Graham to go on a pro-war diatribe sometime within the next month.
[01:08:07.679 --> 01:08:09.221]  Don't be fooled.
[01:08:09.602 --> 01:08:17.311]  Putin says he prefers Joe Biden over Donald Trump because Biden is weak and Trump is strong, but he also might be kind of trolling there as well.
[01:08:17.492 --> 01:08:26.643]  But, you know, anyway, the media... But it's also kind of like throw that red bait to the media and then show the American people how fraudulent the media is that they won't say that, you know, Putin is...
[01:08:27.264 --> 01:08:27.905]  We're good to go.
[01:08:44.031 --> 01:08:57.322]  Israeli rappers call for Dua Lipa, Bella Hadid, and Mia Khalifa to be killed because they're anti-genocide in the Gaza Strip, but of course they won't get banned on X. So there's just some of the developments there.
[01:08:59.517 --> 01:09:03.198]  The Senate tries to pass a $95 billion spending bill.
[01:09:03.419 --> 01:09:07.860]  I would say 80% of the American population is against it.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:14.103]  I mean, even Democrats are sick of spending these bills, these ridiculous spending bills that don't help our country at all.
[01:09:15.023 --> 01:09:17.904]  So they're trying to pass this bill, even though it has no popularity.
[01:09:17.944 --> 01:09:18.725]  And then what do they say?
[01:09:18.825 --> 01:09:20.065]  National security threat!
[01:09:20.445 --> 01:09:21.666]  Russia space nukes!
[01:09:22.512 --> 01:09:30.462]  So do you think, Harrison, that this is just some propaganda to try to get the American people to buy into this new spending bill?
[01:09:30.482 --> 01:09:34.707]  Do you think it's propaganda to try to get the House Republicans to buy into this spending bill?
[01:09:35.522 --> 01:09:39.043]  No, I think Russia has weapons of mass destruction and we must find them.
[01:09:39.103 --> 01:09:45.786]  No, it's baffling to me how the American people seem to fall for the same thing over and over and over again.
[01:09:45.826 --> 01:09:52.008]  The timing is too serendipitous that this massive spending bill that's unpopular and probably not going to get through the House.
[01:09:52.808 --> 01:10:09.734]  Just in time, you have some vague, terrifying threat that, and even the way they released it yesterday, I mean, it was almost like a script where it's like first there's rumblings of a threat, and then we get a little bit more details, and by the end of the day, everybody's tearing their hair out and freaking out.
[01:10:11.335 --> 01:10:13.776]  Maybe Russia has space nukes.
[01:10:14.256 --> 01:10:19.158]  I talked about this a little bit when I actually spaced into American Journal this morning.
[01:10:19.798 --> 01:10:22.944]  There's so many reasons why it makes no sense to have nukes in space.
[01:10:23.284 --> 01:10:30.938]  The ICBM missiles that Russia has developed that are supersonic, the Rods of God technology where you literally just drop nukes
[01:10:32.279 --> 01:10:39.081]  I think Chase has a good reading on this on the way that they're trying to frame Russia as having violated a treaty in the run-up to the war that they really want with Russia.
[01:10:52.791 --> 01:10:53.311]  We're good to go.
[01:11:22.995 --> 01:11:23.995]  I thought you were going to say because...
[01:11:52.009 --> 01:11:52.990]  Space was faking gay.
[01:11:53.010 --> 01:12:03.236]  I do believe that story, though, to be clear, the supposed UFO blowing the nuke out of the sky, I do believe that nuke came from land, though.
[01:12:03.257 --> 01:12:08.860]  I don't think they said that that was... I think it was on board an Air Force flight, but that's like a regular thing.
[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:09.581]  It goes back to the 70s.
[01:12:09.621 --> 01:12:20.708]  There's something called the Tehran incident in 1974 where a fighter jet goes to try to identify unidentified flying objects, and he finds his controls get shut down, even the mechanical controls shut down.
[01:12:21.248 --> 01:12:30.916]  And if you just search UFO disabling nukes, every couple years you get a story about a UFO going over some nuclear facility and shutting down the weapons.
[01:12:31.116 --> 01:12:35.159]  So it's not a new thing, but it was interesting that it happened just before this story broke.
[01:12:35.479 --> 01:12:37.541]  So Russian space nukes, Chase, give me $95 billion.
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:45.465]  I just can't stop thinking about the Babylon Bee headline, United States invades space, finds no weapons of mass destruction.
[01:12:45.545 --> 01:12:46.626]  Right, exactly.
[01:12:46.706 --> 01:12:50.510]  It's just like soldiers floating out of space.
[01:12:51.010 --> 01:12:55.514]  But basically what happened was after the story came out, I was like, this smells like a PSYOP.
[01:12:55.574 --> 01:13:01.420]  So I went to chat GPT, and I just asked the simple question, does Russia have nukes in space?
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:03.081]  And it went into this long...
[01:13:04.182 --> 01:13:05.543]  We're good to go.
[01:13:28.996 --> 01:13:29.717]  We're good to go.
[01:14:00.377 --> 01:14:11.202]  This is all either made up or only coming out now because it's conducive to catalyzing more explicit action, more explicit war with Russia from the international community.
[01:14:11.482 --> 01:14:12.703]  So here's... Oh, wait.
[01:14:12.823 --> 01:14:13.743]  Entering the chat.
[01:14:14.003 --> 01:14:15.024]  Entering the chat.
[01:14:15.324 --> 01:14:15.824]  Ring the bell.
[01:14:15.884 --> 01:14:16.665]  It's now official.
[01:14:16.985 --> 01:14:19.206]  The Knights of the Infowars Roundtable.
[01:14:19.406 --> 01:14:25.029]  The power has just increased into the room and Alex Jones is now in the studio.
[01:14:26.169 --> 01:14:28.493]  Yeah, I'm having to deal with a bunch of the bankruptcy crap.
[01:14:28.553 --> 01:14:32.118]  I'd rather be on air and listen to you guys, but I'm actually up here at the office getting some stuff done.
[01:14:32.138 --> 01:14:35.343]  I'll be back for part of the show tomorrow, and I'll be up here this weekend, obviously.
[01:14:35.363 --> 01:14:40.211]  I've got a lot of court crap I have to deal with that I have to be on site for to deal with.
[01:14:41.793 --> 01:14:55.698]  They do stuff like sell off everything I own, which is fine because I don't care about selling every trinket or every knife or every gun or every book or everything I ever had because truth and justice will be on the air is what matters, and these people don't understand that.
[01:14:55.958 --> 01:15:06.222]  But I've been following the Russia situation, and I know exactly what's going on with the so-called space nukes, so I'm going to shoot a special report right now
[01:15:07.302 --> 01:15:08.263]  That'll be ready for you guys.
[01:15:08.283 --> 01:15:15.786]  And if I was you guys on Spaces, I would actually make it sound about the big Russia threat because Mario Nafal at 3 o'clock will be popping on with him.
[01:15:15.806 --> 01:15:17.066]  He's doing his own Spaces on this.
[01:15:17.086 --> 01:15:23.249]  I don't know what you guys chose to do your Spaces on, but I'm going to have the inside baseball for you guys.
[01:15:23.629 --> 01:15:25.790]  A little five-minute report you can air during that Spaces.
[01:15:25.810 --> 01:15:28.331]  I'll have it ready for you here in about 40 minutes or so, okay?
[01:15:29.383 --> 01:15:30.664]  Copy that.
[01:15:31.364 --> 01:15:42.152]  I'm an expert on this, and I also knew General Benton K. Parton, who was secretly the head of that force, and then Dr. Bob Bowman, who was later the head of the secret forces.
[01:15:42.652 --> 01:15:46.615]  And they never told me anything secret, but they would say this is what they've accidentally declassified.
[01:15:47.175 --> 01:15:49.057]  And so they explained to me X-ray lasers.
[01:15:49.537 --> 01:15:53.060]  The United States has a whole bunch of nuclear-powered lasers in space.
[01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:55.905]  I'll explain what x-ray lasers are and more.
[01:15:55.985 --> 01:15:57.228]  No one else is talking about this.
[01:15:57.629 --> 01:16:00.456]  This broke a few days ago, and I'll just wait for people to see if they come up with the right answers.
[01:16:00.997 --> 01:16:02.440]  As usual, we have all the intel.
[01:16:04.023 --> 01:16:09.306]  Space lasers, it does remind me, obviously, with Hawaii and that whole kerfuffle.
[01:16:09.647 --> 01:16:11.868]  So doing research then, you can find it on YouTube.
[01:16:11.888 --> 01:16:13.769]  Just search space lasers DOD.
[01:16:13.789 --> 01:16:19.313]  Yeah, there's all sorts of lasers in space, lasers on large aircraft and things, and lasers on ships.
[01:16:19.733 --> 01:16:21.094]  An X-ray laser is special.
[01:16:21.114 --> 01:16:21.914]  It's nuclear-powered.
[01:16:22.355 --> 01:16:24.316]  But I'll explain what an X-ray laser is coming up.
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:32.542]  You know, the other thing, too, when they talk about national security threats, well, okay, I can sit here and say the intelligence community is lying to me.
[01:16:32.722 --> 01:16:33.262]  That's obvious.
[01:16:33.282 --> 01:16:34.443]  They've been lying to me my whole life.
[01:16:34.503 --> 01:16:36.844]  But that's not to discount that there aren't national security threats.
[01:16:36.864 --> 01:16:38.344]  We have a wide-open southern border.
[01:16:38.744 --> 01:16:40.765]  We have tensions with Iran increasing.
[01:16:41.025 --> 01:16:42.625]  We have tensions with Russia increasing.
[01:16:42.785 --> 01:16:48.347]  Now they're like, oh, my God, the Russians might be about to deploy an X-ray laser.
[01:16:48.587 --> 01:16:50.148]  We've had them up there since the frickin' late 70s.
[01:16:51.485 --> 01:16:53.007]  Yeah.
[01:16:53.267 --> 01:16:54.088]  It's not even secret.
[01:16:54.128 --> 01:16:55.029]  I'm doing the research.
[01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:58.413]  When Hawaii was happening, there's DOD videos on YouTube.
[01:16:58.454 --> 01:17:03.620]  Their PowerPoint presentations are going, here's the space-mounted lasers, here's the land-mounted lasers, here's the capabilities.
[01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:08.426]  And, you know, at the end, I don't know anything about the nuclear-powered ones, so, you know, obviously...
[01:17:08.926 --> 01:17:09.346]  We're good to go.
[01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:31.061]  You know, we know there are lasers up there.
[01:17:31.261 --> 01:17:38.486]  They can be weaponized, and there's no way for an international body to say that satellite is weaponized lasers and that satellite is atmospheric reading lasers.
[01:17:38.766 --> 01:17:39.846]  It's the same technology.
[01:17:40.327 --> 01:17:41.067]  It's up in space.
[01:17:41.447 --> 01:17:43.149]  It's all public and has been for a while.
[01:17:43.169 --> 01:17:47.291]  You don't need X-ray vision to see right through the New World Order's lies.
[01:17:47.331 --> 01:17:48.012]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:17:48.172 --> 01:17:49.733]  Well, I did a little bit of research on it.
[01:17:49.753 --> 01:17:51.314]  I don't want to take this away from you, but...
[01:17:51.994 --> 01:17:52.655]  We're good to go.
[01:18:12.037 --> 01:18:12.657]  We're good to go.
[01:18:35.828 --> 01:18:36.849]  We're good to go.
[01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:56.766]  I don't think Iran wants a war with the United States.
[01:18:56.867 --> 01:18:59.310]  I don't think Russia wants a war with the United States.
[01:18:59.691 --> 01:19:01.894]  But it's the US that's running regime changes.
[01:19:01.994 --> 01:19:04.297]  It's the US that's funding all these wars overseas.
[01:19:04.557 --> 01:19:09.665]  It's psychotics like Chuck Schumer and Lindsey Graham that support all these wars.
[01:19:10.786 --> 01:19:15.151]  Eventually, you try to fight everybody in the room, somebody's going to punch you back.
[01:19:15.211 --> 01:19:16.012]  I mean, that's my concern.
[01:19:16.272 --> 01:19:18.194]  And now we have a southern border that's wide open.
[01:19:18.555 --> 01:19:19.756]  That's the national security threat.
[01:19:20.056 --> 01:19:22.219]  Chuck Schumer is the national security threat.
[01:19:22.279 --> 01:19:24.321]  Joe Biden is the national security threat.
[01:19:24.942 --> 01:19:27.965]  The military-industrial complex, and then all of this with the wide open southern border.
[01:19:28.005 --> 01:19:29.667]  To me, that's the real national security threat.
[01:19:29.927 --> 01:19:33.911]  Yeah, you have 20,000 Chinese nationals coming across the border since October.
[01:19:34.251 --> 01:19:35.352]  Hundreds in a single day.
[01:19:35.532 --> 01:19:39.196]  Almost all of them adult men, well-dressed, with nice luggage.
[01:19:39.356 --> 01:19:40.276]  These are not refugees.
[01:19:40.297 --> 01:19:41.337]  These are not asylum seekers.
[01:19:41.438 --> 01:19:46.262]  More military-age men have come into the United States illegally than Russians have gone into Ukraine.
[01:19:46.462 --> 01:19:46.642]  Yeah.
[01:19:46.822 --> 01:19:48.003]  For the invasion.
[01:19:48.144 --> 01:19:49.064]  By a huge margin.
[01:19:49.745 --> 01:19:52.848]  And this is the beauty of war from the perspective of the New World Order.
[01:19:53.168 --> 01:19:57.172]  We might not want to be involved in the Middle East.
[01:19:57.212 --> 01:20:01.956]  We might understand that as Americans, there's no benefit for us to be involved over there.
[01:20:02.537 --> 01:20:03.077]  But we are.
[01:20:03.157 --> 01:20:04.499]  So now we have to worry about it.
[01:20:04.899 --> 01:20:08.663]  I don't think that we should be going to war to defeat Hamas.
[01:20:08.703 --> 01:20:11.105]  I don't think we should be going to war with Lebanon to defeat Hezbollah.
[01:20:11.425 --> 01:20:14.268]  I want to stay out of all of it, but we're already involved.
[01:20:14.288 --> 01:20:16.990]  So once you get involved, then you do have to consider these things.
[01:20:17.211 --> 01:20:22.836]  It's not unlikely that they might send terrorists through the southern border to commit a terrorist attack against Americans.
[01:20:22.856 --> 01:20:28.441]  So once you get involved in the war, you're in the war, and now you have to consider these things as national security.
[01:20:28.581 --> 01:20:36.669]  Even if you personally don't think that we should be going to war with these groups, because our leadership does, now we're at risk for blowback.
[01:20:36.949 --> 01:20:42.791]  Well, I think politically speaking, this is going to be a big measurement of where we're at in Congress.
[01:20:42.851 --> 01:20:46.232]  Because I still believe we can politically save the United States of America.
[01:20:46.632 --> 01:20:50.894]  And maybe the race against time is, will our psychotic leaders just blow us off the map first?
[01:20:51.994 --> 01:21:12.663]  But this is going to be the measuring stick because I would say every other Congress in our lifetime, when they come out and they say Russian space nukes or weapons of mass destruction or nuclear yetis, you know, whatever the lie is, Congress, at the snap of a finger, says, okay, whatever funding you want, whatever war you want, we're in, we're voting for it.
[01:21:12.703 --> 01:21:17.986]  We don't want to be the ones that say, oh, no, you know, the space yetis attacked Americans and it was my fault.
[01:21:18.968 --> 01:21:36.472]  If the House Republicans reject this, even after the intelligence community propaganda, I think that shows a major tide shift politically that now you have Republicans that aren't going to go along with the propaganda, they recognize the propaganda, and they'd rather listen to the American people than the intelligence communities.
[01:21:36.792 --> 01:21:37.393]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:21:37.413 --> 01:21:43.478]  I think people criticize the new speaker for basically being the same as McCarthy.
[01:21:43.898 --> 01:21:45.640]  Oh, you got one more hawk for another one.
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:53.527]  But the fact that the first one was even replaced at all, that McCarthy was even booted at all, is indicative of a major shift.
[01:21:53.927 --> 01:21:54.507]  There is...
[01:21:55.188 --> 01:21:55.748]  We're good to go.
[01:21:55.768 --> 01:21:56.349]  We're good to go.
[01:21:56.389 --> 01:21:56.889]  We're good to go.
[01:22:25.251 --> 01:22:25.731]  We're good to go.
[01:22:41.042 --> 01:22:45.365]  Between or from what changes amongst the people and how it's reflected in leadership.
[01:22:45.385 --> 01:22:46.246]  That's just the nature of it.
[01:22:46.586 --> 01:22:57.954]  And right now, we're witnessing that turmoil happen on the political stage, just as we're witnessing the dying gasps of legacy media in the face of these alternative platforms that are just outperforming.
[01:22:58.154 --> 01:23:01.658]  Well, it's sort of carving out... It's an opportunity, I think.
[01:23:01.678 --> 01:23:08.026]  It's an opportunity for people to reach out and grasp and be representative of the huge people in the middle.
[01:23:08.546 --> 01:23:11.850]  Whether it's the war in Israel or the war in Ukraine, you've got...
[01:23:12.915 --> 01:23:13.615]  We're good to go.
[01:23:13.715 --> 01:23:13.935]  I think?
[01:23:42.363 --> 01:23:51.446]  You know, and part of me wonders, too, and who knows if this has been the mentality for a while or if maybe this mentality still exists or exists today.
[01:23:51.506 --> 01:23:54.167]  It's that, okay, well, I'll tell you what, then.
[01:23:54.627 --> 01:23:58.509]  If you're not going to give us the $95 billion, then somebody's getting bombed.
[01:23:58.809 --> 01:23:59.009]  Right?
[01:23:59.269 --> 01:24:04.250]  I mean, that's kind of where the deep state and the military-industrial complex and all these proxy groups come into play.
[01:24:04.891 --> 01:24:09.412]  The military-industrial complex, the deep state control is like, oh, you're not going to give us our $95 billion to launder?
[01:24:09.432 --> 01:24:10.032]  Well, then, you know what?
[01:24:10.052 --> 01:24:11.032]  Somebody's getting bombed tomorrow.
[01:24:11.232 --> 01:24:11.692]  Right.
[01:24:11.953 --> 01:24:15.534]  It's less of this being a warning about a threat, but it's a threat.
[01:24:15.594 --> 01:24:17.154]  It's a threat from our establishment.
[01:24:17.174 --> 01:24:17.994]  Well, they openly say it now.
[01:24:18.034 --> 01:24:20.735]  I mean, Chuck Schumer goes up and says, sign this bill or you're going to war.
[01:24:21.115 --> 01:24:26.238]  Yeah, or give us the border funding or we're going to shut down deportations and let all the people go.
[01:24:26.278 --> 01:24:34.463]  They are actually doing that because they didn't get the money they wanted, so now they're saying, okay, all the people that we had in holding, we're just going to let go because you didn't give us money to keep them.
[01:24:34.503 --> 01:24:37.724]  So we're literally at war with our own government in a very real way.
[01:24:37.744 --> 01:24:41.126]  Yeah, our government is the greatest threat to national security, and it has been for a long time.
[01:24:42.047 --> 01:24:47.770]  I think that that's what most people now see, and I think that that kind of leans into what you were saying earlier.
[01:24:47.810 --> 01:24:49.071]  If there's a way to describe...
[01:24:50.197 --> 01:24:51.057]  We're good to go.
[01:25:06.923 --> 01:25:07.143]  Right?
[01:25:07.323 --> 01:25:09.484]  That's what we need to do to save the country.
[01:25:25.109 --> 01:25:26.610]  Yeah, and you don't often see Democrats
[01:25:41.704 --> 01:25:42.344]  We're good to go.
[01:26:00.174 --> 01:26:00.714]  We're good to go.
[01:26:22.806 --> 01:26:32.254]  I'm very pragmatic when I look at politics, and that's that the takeover of the Republican Party from the neocons is the answer.
[01:26:32.674 --> 01:26:34.736]  And I think that that's what we're seeing right now.
[01:26:35.277 --> 01:26:45.026]  And we're able to get a foot in the door with Donald Trump and then some of the Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz, Rand Paul types, where now the door is open.
[01:26:45.846 --> 01:26:48.467]  And we can actually have this takeover of the Republican Party.
[01:26:48.787 --> 01:26:50.288]  And you brought it up earlier.
[01:26:50.528 --> 01:26:51.829]  Let's say there's three problems.
[01:26:52.409 --> 01:26:53.730]  It's the McRepublicans.
[01:26:54.110 --> 01:26:55.470]  Well, we already got rid of McCarthy.
[01:26:56.071 --> 01:26:59.232]  McConnell, he's done after this congressional session.
[01:26:59.872 --> 01:27:01.413]  I don't see him being the leadership anymore.
[01:27:01.453 --> 01:27:03.354]  There's already grumblings in D.C.
[01:27:03.374 --> 01:27:04.435]  with the Republicans in the Senate.
[01:27:04.475 --> 01:27:05.635]  They've got to get rid of McConnell.
[01:27:06.115 --> 01:27:07.396]  And then McDaniel.
[01:27:07.836 --> 01:27:13.703]  You know, she's basically clinging on with one of her fake nails to her position at the RNC.
[01:27:13.723 --> 01:27:14.584]  So she's going to be gone.
[01:27:14.824 --> 01:27:20.851]  So I think once you get rid of the Mick Republicans leading the party, again, I think there's hope that we can save this country politically.
[01:27:20.911 --> 01:27:22.273]  But then it gets down to the same thing.
[01:27:22.373 --> 01:27:23.735]  Oh, you're not going to give us $95 billion?
[01:27:23.915 --> 01:27:24.756]  Somebody's getting bombed.
[01:27:25.297 --> 01:27:26.518]  So that's kind of the big concern.
[01:27:26.558 --> 01:27:27.719]  Now, we're about to open this up.
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:39.343]  For your comments, questions, considerations on the X Spaces happening right now at InfoWars on X. We've got a lot of people listening in there and we're going to be going to some of you shortly.
[01:27:40.024 --> 01:27:44.525]  We're also going to have a special report from Alex Jones coming up shortly as well.
[01:27:45.205 --> 01:27:46.546]  So this is all coming up shortly.
[01:27:46.706 --> 01:27:50.007]  Remember, everything we do here is brought to you by you shopping at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:27:50.387 --> 01:27:52.227]  Fat guys, I'm going to do a little shopping here.
[01:27:52.267 --> 01:27:53.468]  Can you guys pull up the storefront?
[01:27:54.218 --> 01:27:56.479]  I think I'm going to do a little shopping here.
[01:27:56.539 --> 01:27:58.420]  I think maybe I'm going to need to get some coffee.
[01:27:59.020 --> 01:28:01.261]  We'll get some coffee from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:28:01.321 --> 01:28:01.721]  Or I don't know.
[01:28:01.741 --> 01:28:04.803]  Maybe my caffeine source should be a little Turbo Force Plus.
[01:28:05.543 --> 01:28:07.424]  40% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:28:07.444 --> 01:28:08.604]  I could use a little Brain Force.
[01:28:08.624 --> 01:28:11.305]  There's big, heavy conversations that are being had right now.
[01:28:11.365 --> 01:28:14.727]  Maybe I need some Brain Force Plus from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:28:14.747 --> 01:28:15.607]  40% off that as well.
[01:28:16.007 --> 01:28:17.428]  I'm just going to need some energy for this.
[01:28:17.468 --> 01:28:19.009]  I'm going to need some energy and some focus.
[01:28:19.029 --> 01:28:19.429]  So I don't know.
[01:28:19.449 --> 01:28:19.869]  I think I'm going to...
[01:28:20.109 --> 01:28:22.811]  Guys, let's put some coffee in the cart.
[01:28:22.851 --> 01:28:24.712]  Let's put some Turbo Force Plus in the cart.
[01:28:24.992 --> 01:28:27.333]  Let's put some Brain Force Plus in the cart.
[01:28:27.833 --> 01:28:28.734]  And let's get some energy.
[01:28:28.774 --> 01:28:35.598]  Let's get some focus for these important conversations that we're about to have on in X Spaces with you in the audience.
[01:28:35.638 --> 01:28:39.940]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com, and it's your support there that keeps us on the air.
[01:28:41.241 --> 01:28:43.482]  Really, us just being on air is a victory.
[01:28:43.663 --> 01:28:45.003]  Us just being here is a victory.
[01:28:45.023 --> 01:28:52.028]  But the fact that we have you on with us, three of our hosts here in studio, Alex Jones cutting a special report, that's like massive victory.
[01:28:52.068 --> 01:28:54.389]  That's like light speed victory.
[01:28:54.429 --> 01:28:56.030]  Thanks to your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:28:58.131 --> 01:28:59.992]  But folks, we're standing up for our rights.
[01:29:00.012 --> 01:29:01.093]  We're standing up for your rights.
[01:29:01.133 --> 01:29:03.515]  We're standing up for all of our freedoms and our children.
[01:29:03.715 --> 01:29:08.938]  If you don't spread the word about the broadcast, if you don't share the links, if you don't buy products at InfoWarsStore.com, then...
[01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:11.351]  I'm not griping at you.
[01:29:11.371 --> 01:29:12.491]  I'm just saying, what are you doing?
[01:29:13.572 --> 01:29:16.894]  Less than 1% of you ever buy a product at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:29:17.755 --> 01:29:25.680]  If just half a percent more would go buy a book or a film or a t-shirt or get some of our great supplements and then reorder them because they really work, just try it.
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:28.221]  We would be able to do so many things.
[01:29:28.582 --> 01:29:32.364]  I'm praying to God that he'll touch your heart to decide to support us.
[01:29:32.884 --> 01:29:34.685]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:29:36.766 --> 01:29:37.446]  It's been sold out.
[01:29:37.487 --> 01:29:38.267]  It's back in stock.
[01:29:38.327 --> 01:29:39.528]  Reformulated even stronger.
[01:29:40.329 --> 01:29:42.190]  Nitric boost to clean out your blood and your whole body.
[01:29:42.650 --> 01:29:43.731]  Vasodilation.
[01:29:43.751 --> 01:29:46.113]  It's got a lot of wonderful side effects.
[01:29:46.133 --> 01:29:46.773]  And I mean good ones.
[01:29:46.793 --> 01:29:47.994]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:29:48.615 --> 01:29:49.515]  It is powerful.
[01:29:49.555 --> 01:29:50.476]  So be careful with it.
[01:29:50.836 --> 01:29:51.977]  Next level foundational energy.
[01:29:52.097 --> 01:29:54.739]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:29:58.396 --> 01:30:04.120]  I'm not perfect and I'm under a lot of stress, but if I didn't have the supplements we have, we promote, I wouldn't be able to continue to be on air.
[01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:12.825]  And when you go to InfoWarsStore.com, you are funding the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists in an operation that the enemy admits has been the most effective at exposing them.
[01:30:13.026 --> 01:30:14.607]  Because we're fearless and we don't back down.
[01:30:14.987 --> 01:30:15.948]  We got God on our side.
[01:30:16.268 --> 01:30:17.769]  But God needs to work through you.
[01:30:18.129 --> 01:30:22.132]  You've got to make the decision to get great products you already need at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:22.172 --> 01:30:23.412]  And that is a 360 win.
[01:30:24.013 --> 01:30:26.975]  Nitric Boost, without even knowing, became our number three bestseller.
[01:30:27.655 --> 01:30:29.256]  Because people loved it so much.
[01:30:29.276 --> 01:30:30.217]  They had such great effects.
[01:30:30.517 --> 01:30:36.681]  Got all these natural compounds that clean out the blood, open up your arteries and veins, the capillaries, clean out your heart, your brain, everything.
[01:30:37.502 --> 01:30:39.223]  Well, we got an even better manufacturer.
[01:30:39.243 --> 01:30:44.067]  The other one was great, but one that's even better with even higher quality ingredients at a lower price.
[01:30:45.087 --> 01:30:47.508]  So I could never offer nitric boosts.
[01:30:47.528 --> 01:30:48.989]  It cost us so much to make.
[01:30:49.789 --> 01:30:52.010]  And now we can offer it for 40% off.
[01:30:52.570 --> 01:30:56.352]  Infowarsstore.com nitric boosts finally back in stock.
[01:30:57.012 --> 01:30:57.973]  40% off out of the gates.
[01:30:58.693 --> 01:30:59.473]  Winter is coming.
[01:31:00.154 --> 01:31:00.854]  Winter is coming.
[01:31:01.114 --> 01:31:02.195]  Winter is coming.
[01:31:02.575 --> 01:31:03.355]  Winter is coming.
[01:31:03.635 --> 01:31:04.736]  Winter is coming.
[01:31:05.774 --> 01:31:07.275]  Winter is coming.
[01:31:07.575 --> 01:31:08.976]  Winter isn't coming.
[01:31:09.557 --> 01:31:10.838]  Winter is here.
[01:31:11.238 --> 01:31:18.764]  And while the sun isn't helping us produce as much vitamin D, do yourself a favor and try InfoWars Life Winter Sun Plus.
[01:31:19.024 --> 01:31:23.367]  Now back in stock and 40% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:31:23.627 --> 01:31:34.810]  Winnersome Plus is a powerful vitamin D-based formula bringing you straight vitamin D3 free of toxic chemicals, allergens, preservatives, artificial colors, and GMOs.
[01:31:35.250 --> 01:31:45.953]  Our vitamin D3 formula supports the body's natural immune system, promotes calcium absorption for healthy bones and teeth, and helps sustain healthy tissue and systems of the body.
[01:31:46.313 --> 01:31:48.833]  When the winters come, they come cold.
[01:31:49.033 --> 01:31:51.254]  So weather the storm and supplement Winnersome.
[01:32:00.437 --> 01:32:01.857]  Last year we put this book out.
[01:32:02.698 --> 01:32:04.098]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[01:32:04.118 --> 01:32:05.899]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[01:32:06.479 --> 01:32:09.740]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[01:32:10.260 --> 01:32:11.160]  The Great Awakening.
[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:15.101]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[01:32:15.502 --> 01:32:17.162]  This is such a powerful book.
[01:32:17.562 --> 01:32:19.263]  It covers all the globalist plans.
[01:32:19.283 --> 01:32:19.343]  The
[01:32:19.923 --> 01:32:20.384]  We're good to go.
[01:32:39.065 --> 01:32:46.530]  This is next-level information, and it's a great way to not just support the broadcast, but inform yourself of the next level and share the book with friends and family.
[01:32:46.810 --> 01:32:53.194]  So whether you want one copy or multiple copies, go now to InfoWarsStore.com and get The Great Awakening.
[01:32:53.394 --> 01:32:54.595]  This is going to go to number one.
[01:32:54.615 --> 01:32:55.936]  I want to thank you for your support.
[01:32:56.116 --> 01:32:56.917]  It's a powerful book.
[01:32:57.157 --> 01:32:57.737]  Get yours now.
[01:33:00.539 --> 01:33:06.463]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:17.602 --> 01:33:18.442]  You found it.
[01:33:18.742 --> 01:33:20.283]  The tip of the spear.
[01:33:20.803 --> 01:33:25.585]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[01:33:25.605 --> 01:33:30.087]  We just spoke to Alex during the break.
[01:33:30.227 --> 01:33:32.208]  Project Excalibur.
[01:33:33.123 --> 01:33:36.407]  He has all the documents.
[01:33:36.507 --> 01:33:40.090]  I was going to say, how does that even work?
[01:33:40.170 --> 01:33:43.554]  Alex Jones comes in here literally with the Project Excalibur documents.
[01:33:43.594 --> 01:33:44.515]  I'm not even kidding you.
[01:33:44.535 --> 01:33:45.636]  He had the sword of Excalibur.
[01:33:45.656 --> 01:33:46.177]  He was wielding it.
[01:33:46.657 --> 01:33:48.299]  He's shooting this special report right now.
[01:33:48.359 --> 01:33:53.164]  It's going to debut right here on the Alex Jones Show in T-minus one hour.
[01:33:53.284 --> 01:33:55.647]  So we are just absolutely loaded today with all this information.
[01:33:56.027 --> 01:34:06.891]  We're also about to go to the Twitter spaces where we're discussing this issue, your expertise, and your response to this national security threat so that they can force-feed another $95 billion into war.
[01:34:07.491 --> 01:34:14.234]  Chase is going to be handling this right here from the studio, so Chase, go ahead and start conducting.
[01:34:14.594 --> 01:34:16.617]  Yeah, so we are going to start taking speakers.
[01:34:16.657 --> 01:34:18.840]  It looks like there might be some dead air on the space right now.
[01:34:19.260 --> 01:34:24.487]  If the crew can take a look and make sure that the space is actually getting the audio signal, please let me know.
[01:34:24.667 --> 01:34:29.133]  And what I'll do is I'll start adding people as speakers.
[01:34:30.174 --> 01:34:30.834]  There we go.
[01:34:30.875 --> 01:34:31.395]  We got it fixed.
[01:34:31.555 --> 01:34:31.975]  Thank you.
[01:34:32.595 --> 01:34:43.562]  And we'll be taking your comments and questions, so just give me about a minute to give people some speaker access who have requested it, and then we will pop in and make sure that everything's working here in the space.
[01:34:43.642 --> 01:34:47.284]  You know, it's so great that Musk opened up
[01:34:48.422 --> 01:34:49.323]  We're good to go.
[01:35:10.462 --> 01:35:18.406]  And Harrison, this is why, whether it's the Democrats or anybody else throughout human history, this is why censorship is so important for power.
[01:35:18.806 --> 01:35:30.732]  Because when you have any opposition or any debate or even history, just history being brought up, the people in power that want to control the narrative and control the flow of information and money and power and influence, it hurts them.
[01:35:30.972 --> 01:35:32.313]  It can destroy them.
[01:35:32.353 --> 01:35:34.054]  And that's why censorship has been so important.
[01:35:34.617 --> 01:35:35.957]  And so total, right?
[01:35:36.057 --> 01:35:42.839]  You can have 99% censorship, but if that 1% truth cracks through, that's the crack in the dam that eventually leads to a total collapse.
[01:35:43.219 --> 01:35:55.882]  So it's important for them to have as much censorship as humanly possible, because that one little nugget of truth can break through and shatter the whole paradigm when you get to the level of deception that we're dealing with in the modern day.
[01:35:56.242 --> 01:35:58.083]  So there's sort of multiple ways of that.
[01:35:58.123 --> 01:35:58.303]  There's
[01:35:58.843 --> 01:36:14.764]  There's either total censorship, where the lies that we're being fed are continuous and they can't let anybody disagree or prove them wrong because it shatters the whole paradigm, or there's soft censorship, which is sort of where I fear X is going now, where they don't...
[01:36:15.185 --> 01:36:15.706]  We're good to go.
[01:36:34.747 --> 01:36:40.590]  Well, and no doubt there's still some of that shadow hand going on at X. I'm not sure how much Musk is aware of it or even has the time to look at it or deal with it, quite frankly.
[01:37:04.502 --> 01:37:12.471]  But I noticed that my old account, so I've got the new account at Owen Schroer 1776, which is where the majority of my content goes.
[01:37:12.491 --> 01:37:15.515]  I do more non-political stuff on my old account at All I Do is Owen.
[01:37:15.555 --> 01:37:18.518]  But what's clear, they both have virtually the same amount of followers.
[01:37:18.538 --> 01:37:19.199]  It's like 148 and then 147.
[01:37:19.259 --> 01:37:20.020]  But what's clear is that if...
[01:37:24.682 --> 01:37:25.202]  We're good to go.
[01:37:54.847 --> 01:38:02.578]  When Alex Jones was banned off of YouTube and when InfoWars was banned off of YouTube, so many people just never tuned in again.
[01:38:02.718 --> 01:38:04.340]  Now, we were still on air every day.
[01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:06.423]  We had to build our own platforms, and we did.
[01:38:06.744 --> 01:38:10.108]  And so we've kind of created our own ship that we can survive without it now.
[01:38:10.168 --> 01:38:11.530]  Thank God we're prepared for that.
[01:38:12.304 --> 01:38:15.087]  But it was like this weird phenomenon where it's just, I only go to YouTube.
[01:38:15.247 --> 01:38:17.289]  And if you're not on YouTube, then I'm not going there.
[01:38:17.589 --> 01:38:32.865]  Well, the same thing is kind of the case with X. People only go to X. They wake up in the morning, they go to X. They sit in their car, they go to X. They turn their car off or on, they go to X. They sit down on the toilet, they go to X. But that's all they do is they always go to X. So now that we're back there, people are like, oh, Infowars is back.
[01:38:32.885 --> 01:38:35.428]  Well, we never went anywhere, but they're tuning in again.
[01:38:35.828 --> 01:38:39.113]  Yeah, no, and we were talking about this, because there's something special about Spaces.
[01:38:39.173 --> 01:38:41.416]  Spaces is kind of unlike any other.
[01:38:41.456 --> 01:38:44.341]  It's different than the live streaming atmosphere.
[01:38:44.401 --> 01:38:45.843]  It's different than the radio atmosphere.
[01:38:46.263 --> 01:38:50.910]  The ability to interact, the ability to post your messages, the ability to...
[01:38:51.491 --> 01:38:51.931]  We're good to go.
[01:39:21.951 --> 01:39:22.831]  ...never existed again.
[01:39:22.871 --> 01:39:28.272]  So it's, you know, as much as Elon Musk has sort of... Because we know the shadow banning has taken place.
[01:39:28.692 --> 01:39:36.754]  There was a compilation recently that I was a part of where it was showing that people with massive engagement... My engagement was up 90-something percent.
[01:39:37.334 --> 01:39:41.235]  Every other number was down massively, hundreds of points.
[01:39:42.195 --> 01:39:43.315]  Meaning that... It's a hero effect.
[01:39:43.715 --> 01:39:44.496]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:44.616 --> 01:39:44.956]  Literally.
[01:39:45.016 --> 01:39:45.976]  So because I...
[01:39:47.336 --> 01:39:50.697]  Because people aren't being fed my stuff, they're just not seeing it.
[01:39:50.737 --> 01:39:52.038]  So we don't like that.
[01:39:52.138 --> 01:39:54.919]  We don't like some of the moves that Elon Musk has made very recently.
[01:39:54.939 --> 01:40:09.405]  Personally, I'm not a big fan of censorship sort of working its way back into X. But what he's done so far, us getting our accounts back, being able to do this live, it's absolutely tremendous the amount of free speech that's on X compared to how it used to be just a couple years ago.
[01:40:09.585 --> 01:40:11.926]  Well, and it's going to become even more important now.
[01:40:11.966 --> 01:40:14.667]  This story hit the press yesterday.
[01:40:14.787 --> 01:40:23.390]  George Soros is about to take control of 220 of the most popular radio stations that are left out there.
[01:40:23.470 --> 01:40:27.131]  And obviously, to an extent, radio is a dying medium.
[01:40:27.511 --> 01:40:36.094]  More people are using the Internet or apps or streaming platforms in their cars or even XM satellite radio.
[01:40:37.014 --> 01:40:37.475]  We're good to go.
[01:40:57.515 --> 01:40:57.936]  We're good to go.
[01:41:13.826 --> 01:41:14.406]  We're good to go.
[01:41:14.747 --> 01:41:15.327]  We're good to go.
[01:41:30.996 --> 01:41:33.478]  Get your own sponsors or sponsors the station brings in.
[01:41:33.879 --> 01:41:35.560]  Usually, you can say pretty much whatever you want.
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:37.802]  I mean, there's still censorship on talk radio, obviously.
[01:41:38.343 --> 01:41:41.005]  But still, that's where a lot of this stuff can get through.
[01:41:41.065 --> 01:41:42.166]  And there's private ownership.
[01:41:42.206 --> 01:41:43.247]  There's local ownership.
[01:41:43.768 --> 01:41:44.388]  But now it's...
[01:41:45.236 --> 01:41:45.996]  We're good to go.
[01:42:15.082 --> 01:42:21.604]  100%.
[01:42:15.122 --> 01:42:21.604]  And these are big radio... Like, these are radio stations that... I've never lived in New York City, but I know, you know, Tin Tin Wins.
[01:42:21.644 --> 01:42:23.025]  Like, I've heard of that before.
[01:42:23.045 --> 01:42:26.346]  I mean, these are huge stations that have been around for decades.
[01:42:26.366 --> 01:42:31.347]  And I listen to the local radio quite a bit because I find it's the best way to sort of find out what's going on in my city.
[01:42:31.387 --> 01:42:34.208]  You know, there's not a lot of locality when it comes to social media.
[01:42:34.508 --> 01:42:42.411]  I'm getting news from all over the world, but if I want to find out what's in Austin, I tune into my radio station and, you know, hear about events and festivals and that sort of thing.
[01:42:42.451 --> 01:42:42.551]  So...
[01:42:43.371 --> 01:42:48.580]  Incredibly powerful weapon array just captured by the enemy forces under George Soros.
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:51.224]  All right, so we'll go to X Spaces then.
[01:42:51.344 --> 01:42:54.049]  Maybe that will replace talk radio.
[01:42:54.069 --> 01:42:55.571]  Maybe you can have some free speech there.
[01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:01.382]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalist.
[01:43:01.762 --> 01:43:04.124]  And people can't identify who's a patriot and who isn't.
[01:43:04.444 --> 01:43:07.586]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalist.
[01:43:07.646 --> 01:43:10.548]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.
[01:43:10.808 --> 01:43:21.376]  That's why I designed this amazing 1776 red, white, and blue Gadsden flag shirt so you can support the Infowar and meet like-minded people everywhere when you wear it.
[01:43:21.496 --> 01:43:27.119]  When you wear these shirts, it creates an amazing amount of energy, and it's quite the adventure.

[01:43:37.865 --> 01:43:43.107]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is antithetical, the complete opposite of what the globalists are pushing.

[01:43:59.105 --> 01:44:04.547]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[01:44:05.308 --> 01:44:09.590]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:14.372]  We finally have a limited run back in supply at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:44:15.812 --> 01:44:18.594]  So many people have serious issues.
[01:44:18.854 --> 01:44:19.975]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[01:44:20.435 --> 01:44:25.839]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[01:44:26.379 --> 01:44:31.782]  Most of their iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[01:44:32.403 --> 01:44:35.685]  But this is pure atomic certified iodine.
[01:44:37.998 --> 01:44:41.079]  X2 is now back in stock, discounted.
[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:44.582]  So I'm giving Thanksgiving right now for this product being here.
[01:44:44.922 --> 01:44:50.025]  It funds the InfoWar, but I guarantee you, you take this for a few weeks, you will feel the difference.
[01:44:50.185 --> 01:44:50.985]  It is amazing.
[01:44:51.306 --> 01:44:55.348]  It's the missing link, X2, back in stock at the end of 2023 at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:44:55.368 --> 01:44:55.388]  X2.
[01:44:58.670 --> 01:45:03.975]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing, high-quality coffee has not been available.
[01:45:04.435 --> 01:45:08.799]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[01:45:09.259 --> 01:45:11.722]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[01:45:12.282 --> 01:45:21.670]  But now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a natural supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.
[01:45:21.870 --> 01:45:24.453]  It's powered by the company Minute Man Coffee.
[01:45:25.093 --> 01:45:33.135]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best-tasting, best-smelling, strongest coffee that I have ever drank.
[01:45:33.615 --> 01:45:35.016]  It is game-changing.
[01:45:35.456 --> 01:45:37.656]  All you've got to do is buy a bag of it and try it.
[01:45:37.716 --> 01:45:40.797]  I know you're going to be hooked, which will then fund your Operation A360 win.
[01:45:41.057 --> 01:45:45.058]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com right now for Escape to Prison Planet Light Roast.
[01:45:45.078 --> 01:45:45.878]  That's the strongest.
[01:45:46.138 --> 01:45:48.539]  The amazing medium roast wig of America.
[01:45:48.999 --> 01:45:56.246]  And finally, the best tasting dark roast tip of the spear, now exclusively available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:45:56.506 --> 01:45:57.287]  Get your coffee now.
[01:45:58.865 --> 01:46:05.288]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the globalist agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[01:46:05.368 --> 01:46:19.575]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections, masquerading as vaccines.
[01:46:19.735 --> 01:46:24.598]  It is so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives oblivious.
[01:46:26.155 --> 01:46:27.761]  You realize ignorance is not bliss.
[01:46:28.002 --> 01:46:28.744]  It equals death.
[01:46:30.373 --> 01:46:50.809]  But people are starting to really understand how serious things are, and that's a hard thing to do, because to wake up to a disturbing reality and realize that we're in the middle of a giant biological weapons war against humanity, and that there's mass sterilization that's already taking place, and they're cutting off all the major energy sources, is really hard to deal with, but it's the reality.
[01:46:51.370 --> 01:46:55.553]  Facing it is our only chance to turn this around, because stuff's about to get really, really nasty.
[01:46:55.953 --> 01:46:56.594]  Infowars.com
[01:47:00.450 --> 01:47:06.371]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:32.011 --> 01:47:33.932]  We're back here live in studio.
[01:47:33.952 --> 01:47:35.854]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:35.874 --> 01:47:36.834]  I'm sure you're hosting today.
[01:47:36.855 --> 01:47:44.820]  I've got Harrison Smith, Chase Geiser with us, and a special report coming up from Alex Jones momentarily.
[01:47:45.461 --> 01:47:50.604]  We're trying to get this X Spaces up, having some technical difficulties, so we'll give you an update on that.
[01:47:51.385 --> 01:48:00.812]  Meanwhile, though, you know, this illegal immigrant issue is... I mean, I feel like this thing is about to fall off a cliff because...
[01:48:02.975 --> 01:48:09.404]  It really has... I mean, this whole notion that, oh, well, it's asylum seekers or it's people just looking for a better life and all that.
[01:48:09.845 --> 01:48:14.551]  Folks, we now are importing massive gang activity and violent criminals.
[01:48:14.992 --> 01:48:17.996]  And I already had some news about this on my desk.
[01:48:18.236 --> 01:48:19.438]  But, I mean, just listen to this stuff.
[01:48:20.805 --> 01:48:25.848]  Rapes, robberies, and shootouts at Darien Gap as Biden border crisis spreads chaos.
[01:48:26.408 --> 01:48:27.669]  Now this is all commonplace.
[01:48:28.189 --> 01:48:30.991]  Just raping and robbing and killing people.
[01:48:31.071 --> 01:48:32.411]  It's just normal activity.
[01:48:33.192 --> 01:48:33.812]  It's Mad Max.
[01:48:33.832 --> 01:48:34.673]  I mean, it's literally Mad Max.
[01:48:35.273 --> 01:48:42.157]  James O'Keefe has to extract his undercover journalist after being held at gunpoint inside human trafficking camp.
[01:48:43.362 --> 01:48:47.563]  So, you know, they got guns, they're holding people hostage, I guess.
[01:48:48.264 --> 01:48:50.044]  And then who could have predicted this?
[01:48:50.164 --> 01:48:52.285]  I mean, seriously, who could have seen this coming?
[01:48:53.205 --> 01:49:01.788]  One of the young individuals that assaulted that police officer in New York City that got released has been arrested again.
[01:49:02.309 --> 01:49:02.509]  What?
[01:49:02.829 --> 01:49:09.071]  Illegal immigrant that was arrested in cop beating and released next day, arrested again for robbing a Macy's.
[01:49:10.506 --> 01:49:11.827]  He'll be out again tomorrow, guarantee it.
[01:49:12.548 --> 01:49:18.352]  And there was another, while Harrison, while you respond to this, guys, just give me B-roll of clip 19.
[01:49:18.973 --> 01:49:24.317]  You had another mob of illegal immigrants attacking a police officer, this time with a machete.
[01:49:24.657 --> 01:49:26.118]  This is gang activity.
[01:49:27.159 --> 01:49:32.563]  110% this is gang activity on top of obviously it being criminal activity.
[01:49:32.603 --> 01:49:33.444]  But there you go, Harrison.
[01:49:34.104 --> 01:49:37.387]  The same guy that they arrested and released the next day robbed a Macy's.
[01:49:38.154 --> 01:49:38.894]  Well, why wouldn't he?
[01:49:38.955 --> 01:49:40.696]  I mean, you beat a cop and you get away with it.
[01:49:40.716 --> 01:49:44.738]  Robbing a Macy's is nothing compared to beating an NYPD officer.
[01:49:44.818 --> 01:49:46.839]  So, yeah, I mean, what do you expect?
[01:49:46.859 --> 01:49:47.940]  You don't punish people for crimes.
[01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:48.981]  They keep committing crimes.
[01:49:49.161 --> 01:49:49.681]  I know.
[01:49:49.701 --> 01:49:55.305]  This is like a shocking revelation to most people in charge of our law enforcement these days.
[01:49:57.059 --> 01:49:58.720]  You know, it's not just the gangs.
[01:49:58.740 --> 01:50:01.302]  I mean, these cartels are infiltrating.
[01:50:02.143 --> 01:50:05.966]  It's going to eventually be... I mean, you're talking about a million people a month.
[01:50:05.986 --> 01:50:08.808]  988,000 people this year, as in 2024.
[01:50:08.928 --> 01:50:10.189]  No, it's absurd.
[01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:14.693]  One month, it's roughly... Mark McGuire on pace to hit 700 home runs in a season.
[01:50:14.933 --> 01:50:17.875]  Yeah, it's beyond any record you can even imagine.
[01:50:18.136 --> 01:50:25.141]  And by the way, there's no shortage of... There's never going to be a point where it's like, okay, we've taken 100 million, now they've run out.
[01:50:25.241 --> 01:50:25.822]  You know, it's like...
[01:50:26.442 --> 01:50:27.203]  I think we're good to go.
[01:50:44.225 --> 01:50:46.546]  There's a reason that America isn't Mexico.
[01:50:46.586 --> 01:50:48.886]  America isn't Colombia.
[01:50:49.506 --> 01:50:50.706]  No offense to these countries.
[01:50:50.746 --> 01:50:54.467]  They're beautiful places, and the people in the vast majority are great.
[01:50:54.547 --> 01:51:04.189]  But last time I was down in Mexico, there was a painting, and it was a police officer standing there holding a bitten apple because they have this thing called the bite.
[01:51:04.489 --> 01:51:08.310]  And it's just that little bribery that you know to expect any time you want to do anything.
[01:51:08.550 --> 01:51:12.931]  You get pulled over by the cop, you might get a ticket, but you're definitely going to be shaken down for a bribe.
[01:51:13.331 --> 01:51:13.991]  We're good to go.
[01:51:34.724 --> 01:51:35.685]  We're good to go.
[01:52:03.846 --> 01:52:08.850]  Well, and here's, because look, illegal immigrants committing crimes is no new story.
[01:52:09.310 --> 01:52:18.678]  Illegal immigrants raping, robbing, killing, it's no new story, but it's an ever-increasing phenomenon, but it's still more of a rare occurrence, you might say.
[01:52:18.698 --> 01:52:21.400]  It should be a zero occurrence, but it's still more of a rare occurrence.
[01:52:22.281 --> 01:52:27.008]  I'm telling you, I think this calendar year, this story is going to take off.
[01:52:27.408 --> 01:52:34.299]  I think it is now going to be a common, I mean like daily, where you're going to have illegal immigrants raping, robbing, and killing.
[01:52:34.639 --> 01:52:37.183]  That's how many they're bringing in, but it's just that...
[01:52:37.964 --> 01:52:38.725]  We're good to go.
[01:52:38.745 --> 01:52:39.065]  I think?
[01:53:00.206 --> 01:53:01.087]  I mean, who knows?
[01:53:01.227 --> 01:53:05.809]  All hell could break loose in some of these communities where you have thousands of these illegal immigrants.
[01:53:05.830 --> 01:53:06.830]  They could be gang members.
[01:53:07.410 --> 01:53:10.132]  Because look, what we just saw in El Salvador.
[01:53:10.772 --> 01:53:15.135]  It was shocking when you saw all the gang members that got arrested and put in the prisons.
[01:53:15.155 --> 01:53:16.596]  You're like, oh my gosh, there's that many?
[01:53:16.676 --> 01:53:17.537]  Yeah, there's that many.
[01:53:17.597 --> 01:53:18.497]  And by the way, there's more.
[01:53:18.857 --> 01:53:21.579]  They're just not committing crimes anymore because they know they're going to get arrested.
[01:53:21.799 --> 01:53:28.143]  Well, now they know, well, if this is the new standard in Central America, we've got to go to the United States where we get protected by law enforcement.
[01:53:28.243 --> 01:53:32.444]  Well, and the mainstream media calls Bukele a dictator for what he's doing.
[01:53:32.484 --> 01:53:40.086]  So maybe these MS-13 members, gang members, could claim asylum on the basis of they'll be arrested by the dictator Bukele if we don't let him in.
[01:53:40.347 --> 01:53:43.087]  As absurd as that sounds, it's not absurd at all.
[01:53:43.107 --> 01:53:44.128]  I mean, they're literally doing it.
[01:53:44.448 --> 01:53:48.289]  Well, and this kind of leads me into this shooting, again, that happened at the parade.
[01:53:49.651 --> 01:53:53.433]  I'm a little confused at how little information we're able to get on these shooters.
[01:53:53.513 --> 01:53:55.875]  Now, there have been some conflicting reports that came out.
[01:53:56.835 --> 01:54:03.600]  I am not convinced of any of it yet because they're conflicting, and some of it's even been proved to be not accurate.
[01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:06.401]  But you know they have the information on these shooters.
[01:54:06.641 --> 01:54:13.185]  Why they're not releasing it to the public is another question, and I'm not going to leap to any conclusions or assumptions, but it's odd.
[01:54:13.646 --> 01:54:15.367]  Oh, well, we still don't know everything.
[01:54:15.387 --> 01:54:16.507]  We're still learning more about the shooters.
[01:54:16.527 --> 01:54:16.848]  What do you mean?
[01:54:16.868 --> 01:54:18.288]  They know exactly everything about the shooters.
[01:54:18.308 --> 01:54:18.949]  They already brought them in.
[01:54:19.529 --> 01:54:20.230]  Oh, that's interesting.
[01:54:36.221 --> 01:54:37.562]  Well, that's just, okay, what's an assault weapon?
[01:54:37.582 --> 01:54:38.782]  It could be a hammer.
[01:54:38.802 --> 01:54:39.922]  It could be a baseball bat.
[01:55:03.271 --> 01:55:05.793]  Well, and also, I mean, did these guys use assault weapons?
[01:55:06.033 --> 01:55:22.746]  This is the frustrating thing, is they'll point to things, they'll point to this, which I don't think they were assault weapons that were used, so they'll take an event where pistols are used, and they'll say, see, that's why we need to ban assault weapons, or they'll take the stats, where they'll show, look how many gun deaths occur, we have to ban rifles and assault weapons, and it's like, okay, but 99% of those...
[01:55:24.267 --> 01:55:26.288]  Statistics that you're showing me were handguns.
[01:55:26.488 --> 01:55:33.791]  So you're showing me a problem, and then you're offering a solution that does not address that problem at all because it's not about addressing the actual problem.
[01:55:33.871 --> 01:55:36.912]  It's about disarming Americans from our Second Amendment.
[01:55:37.612 --> 01:55:42.474]  Democrat, Governor of California, we need to pass a constitutional amendment against guns.
[01:55:42.534 --> 01:55:44.154]  What happened to unalienable?
[01:55:44.555 --> 01:55:47.075]  What happened to shall not be infringed?
[01:55:47.616 --> 01:55:50.577]  The other side of this story, though, Harrison, is that
[01:55:51.604 --> 01:55:51.784]  I think?
[01:56:06.564 --> 01:56:06.684]  Yeah.
[01:56:25.003 --> 01:56:25.383]  We're good to go.
[01:56:43.699 --> 01:56:56.187]  It has so much more to do with the composition of our society, the collapse of our social cohesion, of the rampant crime that is gutting our inner cities, that is devastating families across the nation.
[01:56:56.908 --> 01:56:58.428]  We can deal with this at a root issue.
[01:56:58.549 --> 01:56:59.989]  It's not the guns that are the problem.
[01:57:00.310 --> 01:57:07.654]  At the end of the day, it's about whether or not you're a free human with the dignity to arm yourself or whether you are a slave and a subject at the...
[01:57:08.835 --> 01:57:09.215]  All right.
[01:57:09.235 --> 01:57:09.475]  All right.
[01:57:36.423 --> 01:57:38.724]  Second hour of the Alex Jones Show complete.
[01:57:38.984 --> 01:57:39.844]  Are we on space?
[01:57:39.864 --> 01:57:40.164]  We're good.
[01:57:40.184 --> 01:57:41.164]  What do you think is going to happen here?
[01:57:41.405 --> 01:57:41.845]  We fixed it.
[01:57:41.865 --> 01:57:42.625]  It was a technical issue.
[01:57:42.645 --> 01:57:43.625]  We'll be taking speakers next time.
[01:57:43.645 --> 01:57:44.425]  You had to go into the Matrix?
[01:57:44.445 --> 01:57:44.525]  Yeah.
[01:57:44.605 --> 01:57:45.726]  You had to go into the Tron code?
[01:57:45.746 --> 01:57:46.026]  Yeah.
[01:57:48.727 --> 01:57:49.647]  Hello, Americans.
[01:57:50.447 --> 01:57:52.048]  I want to share with you a story.
[01:57:52.688 --> 01:57:58.930]  A story about inflammation, the silent menace that lurks within our bodies, affecting our health and well-being.
[01:58:00.030 --> 01:58:05.792]  Inflammation, the root cause of countless ailments, quietly wreaking havoc over time.
[01:58:06.866 --> 01:58:07.827]  We're good to go.
[01:58:07.887 --> 01:58:08.407]  We're good to go.
[01:58:29.574 --> 01:58:37.258]  A powerful blend crafted with precision, boasting 95% curcuminoids extracted from turmeric.
[01:58:37.398 --> 01:58:39.359]  It's good for your heart, your brain, everything.
[01:58:39.479 --> 01:58:44.462]  It is 40% off, back in stock, Bobby's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[01:58:45.002 --> 01:58:46.723]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:48.784 --> 01:58:53.406]  29 years on air, all I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalist.
[01:58:54.107 --> 01:58:59.429]  And I've done the best job I can to tell those words that have been accurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[01:58:59.829 --> 01:59:06.252]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves, unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people.
[01:59:06.492 --> 01:59:07.192]  We don't do that.
[01:59:07.653 --> 01:59:09.533]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[01:59:09.914 --> 01:59:11.915]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product.
[01:59:11.975 --> 01:59:12.555]  It's so powerful.
[01:59:13.475 --> 01:59:23.539]  This is the breakdown product after your cells process it of folic acid, methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[01:59:23.999 --> 01:59:25.220]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[01:59:25.260 --> 01:59:26.120]  It's not a stimulant.
[01:59:26.380 --> 01:59:28.261]  It energizes your cells.
[01:59:28.761 --> 01:59:31.242]  And then everything else you take just supercharges it.
[01:59:31.302 --> 01:59:32.142]  It's so insane.
[01:59:32.483 --> 01:59:34.023]  It's foundational energy.
[01:59:34.463 --> 01:59:38.585]  The strongest formula out there at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:38.985 --> 01:59:41.826]  It doesn't just energize this operation against the tyrants.
[01:59:41.926 --> 01:59:43.027]  It energizes you.
[01:59:43.307 --> 01:59:44.807]  Get foundational energy now!
[01:59:50.470 --> 01:59:54.551]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:55.091 --> 01:59:56.372]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:09.412 --> 02:00:10.193]  All right, we've done it.
[02:00:10.613 --> 02:00:19.019]  Chase Geiser had to tron himself and go into the Twitter X Spaces coding to get this worked out.
[02:00:19.679 --> 02:00:21.200]  But we're good to go now.
[02:00:21.241 --> 02:00:23.102]  I believe we're up on Spaces.
[02:00:23.142 --> 02:00:27.565]  Do you want to start going to people right now, Chase, on the issue of Russian space nukes?
[02:00:27.885 --> 02:00:30.087]  And we've got a report from Alex Jones coming up in half an hour.
[02:00:30.467 --> 02:00:31.027]  Yeah, sure.
[02:00:31.067 --> 02:00:36.931]  So Matt is in the control room, sitting where I usually sit, moderating the spaces for Alex Jones.
[02:00:37.071 --> 02:00:43.435]  And if he wants to begin adding people as speakers and inviting them to speak, I invite him to do so.
[02:00:45.056 --> 02:00:46.116]  And just make sure to request.
[02:00:46.136 --> 02:00:47.957]  If you're in the space, make sure to request.
[02:00:48.238 --> 02:00:48.758]  And raise your hand.
[02:00:48.778 --> 02:00:49.578]  That always helps, too.
[02:00:49.758 --> 02:00:50.579]  So we know that you want to.
[02:00:52.546 --> 02:01:00.675]  So while they're working on that, I'll just let Matt ping me or say something in our ears when they're ready to begin broadcasting to the speakers.
[02:01:00.695 --> 02:01:05.260]  But you should be able to grant access to those who have requested it, and then we can invite them to speak.
[02:01:06.501 --> 02:01:07.863]  Truth, not fiction.
[02:01:08.804 --> 02:01:09.865]  Truth, not fiction?
[02:01:10.566 --> 02:01:12.348]  Go ahead and unmute yourself.
[02:01:16.181 --> 02:01:18.182]  Hey, Chase, mutual friend of Matt Couch.
[02:01:18.422 --> 02:01:19.102]  Awesome.
[02:01:19.402 --> 02:01:28.944]  Owen, I'm glad to see that you're finally doing what you're good at and you're not in the Louisiana gulag anymore.
[02:01:29.765 --> 02:01:34.266]  And Harrison Smith, I can't say enough about you.
[02:01:34.306 --> 02:01:40.007]  But listen, everything the mainstream media says is the exact opposite.
[02:01:40.227 --> 02:01:41.908]  Look what they did to Tucker Carlson.
[02:01:42.620 --> 02:01:50.126]  He's now the world-renowned journalist of the world and a lot of influence from the InfoWars.
[02:01:50.886 --> 02:01:53.889]  But, you know, we have to be cautious.
[02:01:54.629 --> 02:02:01.835]  I'd like to talk to Alex Jones, but they are definitely trying to derail the 2024 election.
[02:02:02.655 --> 02:02:09.641]  And I appreciate everything you guys do for aiding that effort to derail that.
[02:02:10.473 --> 02:02:17.077]  By the way, there might have been another one in D.C.
[02:02:17.097 --> 02:02:17.537]  we're hearing.
[02:02:17.577 --> 02:02:19.479]  There's some smoke coming out of a subway tunnel.
[02:02:20.139 --> 02:02:24.241]  Yeah, apparently smoke billowing out of the D.C.
[02:02:24.321 --> 02:02:25.062]  subway system.
[02:02:25.082 --> 02:02:28.524]  They say it's either a train derailment or an explosion of some sort.
[02:02:28.584 --> 02:02:29.845]  That just broke a couple minutes ago.
[02:02:29.865 --> 02:02:32.506]  We don't have too many details on that, but it's every day.
[02:02:32.887 --> 02:02:37.269]  Our cities are falling apart, but we got all the money we need for Ukraine and Israel until the end of time.
[02:02:38.030 --> 02:02:39.171]  What is it about tunnels in 2024?
[02:02:40.863 --> 02:02:44.527]  And, is it the year of the tunnel in China?
[02:02:45.308 --> 02:02:45.908]  Or somewhere else?
[02:02:46.329 --> 02:02:49.692]  But they also just came out, there was a statement.
[02:02:51.094 --> 02:02:51.834]  Guys, plug this in.
[02:02:51.935 --> 02:02:54.838]  Somebody just came out and said that soon the U.S.
[02:02:54.878 --> 02:02:59.002]  government, it's already all in the books, it's just the number hasn't hit yet, that the U.S.
[02:02:59.022 --> 02:03:01.524]  government is going to be $54 trillion in debt.
[02:03:01.705 --> 02:03:02.706]  And this is clown money.
[02:03:03.561 --> 02:03:09.206]  Well, when money isn't real and doesn't exist, it turns out you can print as much as you want forever.
[02:03:09.226 --> 02:03:10.427]  That's completely insane.
[02:03:10.968 --> 02:03:12.209]  And you know, there's a funny thing.
[02:03:12.229 --> 02:03:17.014]  I responded... Actually, there was a video from yours, though, and then I played on the show yesterday.
[02:03:18.148 --> 02:03:18.308]  I think.
[02:03:18.328 --> 02:03:18.568]  I think.
[02:03:36.019 --> 02:03:36.520]  We're good to go.
[02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:36.780]  I think?
[02:03:55.661 --> 02:03:58.662]  What's interesting to me is if you look at architecture before the first bomb went off,
[02:04:23.416 --> 02:04:27.918]  It was this sort of beautiful, magnificent sort of facilities built by different nations.
[02:04:27.938 --> 02:04:34.221]  So even architecture built by Britain in India was beautiful.
[02:04:34.241 --> 02:04:36.562]  But after the bomb went off, it's like, oh, people are cheap.
[02:04:36.982 --> 02:04:38.303]  And so now we have DMVs.
[02:04:38.343 --> 02:04:42.705]  Yeah, you know, that's a really heavy debate that I'd love to have sometime.
[02:04:43.125 --> 02:04:45.606]  And thank you for weighing in here, Truth Not Fiction.
[02:04:45.626 --> 02:04:47.427]  When we come back, long segment.
[02:04:47.887 --> 02:04:52.611]  We're going to get at least three, four, five people in on the X-Spaces to weigh in on Russian space news.
[02:04:52.751 --> 02:04:53.091]  Real?
[02:04:53.211 --> 02:04:53.492]  Fake?
[02:04:53.672 --> 02:04:54.833]  Is it just they want more money?
[02:04:54.893 --> 02:04:55.733]  What's the story here?
[02:04:58.396 --> 02:05:00.237]  But folks, we're standing up for our rights.
[02:05:00.257 --> 02:05:01.338]  We're standing up for your rights.
[02:05:01.378 --> 02:05:03.760]  We're standing up for all of our freedoms and our children.
[02:05:03.980 --> 02:05:11.626]  If you don't spread the word about the broadcast, if you don't share the links, if you don't buy products at InfoWarsStore.com, then I'm not griping at you.
[02:05:11.646 --> 02:05:12.767]  I'm just saying, what are you doing?
[02:05:13.828 --> 02:05:17.111]  Less than 1% of you ever buy a product at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:05:18.007 --> 02:05:25.011]  If just a half a percent more would go buy a book or a film or a t-shirt or get some of our great supplements and then reorder them because they really work.
[02:05:25.332 --> 02:05:25.912]  Just try it.
[02:05:26.532 --> 02:05:28.453]  We would be able to do so many things.
[02:05:28.834 --> 02:05:32.596]  I'm praying to God that he'll touch your heart to decide to support us.
[02:05:33.136 --> 02:05:34.877]  Infowarsstore.com
[02:05:37.022 --> 02:05:37.682]  It's been sold out.
[02:05:37.723 --> 02:05:38.503]  It's back in stock.
[02:05:38.583 --> 02:05:39.764]  Reformulated even stronger.
[02:05:40.545 --> 02:05:42.426]  Nitric boost to clean out your blood and your whole body.
[02:05:42.886 --> 02:05:43.967]  Vasodilation.
[02:05:43.987 --> 02:05:46.369]  It's got a lot of wonderful side effects.
[02:05:46.389 --> 02:05:46.909]  And I mean good ones.
[02:05:46.969 --> 02:05:48.230]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:05:48.871 --> 02:05:49.751]  It is powerful.
[02:05:49.791 --> 02:05:50.732]  So be careful with it.
[02:05:51.072 --> 02:05:52.233]  Next level foundational energy.
[02:05:52.333 --> 02:05:54.995]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:06:02.463 --> 02:06:04.625]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:04.645 --> 02:06:10.409]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:10.669 --> 02:06:13.691]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:06:14.612 --> 02:06:18.294]  We're back here, third hour of the Alex Jones Show, brought to you by InfoWarStore.com.
[02:06:18.314 --> 02:06:29.182]  By the way, we're going to be getting a special report from Alex Jones, the real story about Russian space nukes, and the classified documents from Project Excalibur.
[02:06:29.742 --> 02:06:36.648]  So the InfoWars Knights of the Roundtable magic continues here on this Thursday, February 15th transmission.
[02:06:36.688 --> 02:06:40.592]  But we're live on X Spaces, and we're going to be hearing from you there.
[02:06:41.032 --> 02:06:42.513]  And so we go back to X Spaces.
[02:06:42.593 --> 02:06:46.777]  We have one of our great crew members conducting it from the control room.
[02:06:46.817 --> 02:06:48.298]  Go ahead and let us know who's up next.
[02:06:49.399 --> 02:06:53.103]  Hey, we got JP in the X Space.
[02:06:53.243 --> 02:06:56.666]  JP, go ahead and unmute your mic and go ahead and let us know what's on your mind.
[02:06:59.847 --> 02:07:00.507]  Hey, how's it going?
[02:07:01.468 --> 02:07:10.352]  You know, you guys were just talking about all these buildings in Europe and all these buildings all over, and World War II, they bombed a lot of these buildings, right?
[02:07:10.372 --> 02:07:12.513]  These are those buildings that have 30-foot doors.
[02:07:12.573 --> 02:07:15.874]  They had these organs that were detuned to play deep, ominous tunes.
[02:07:15.934 --> 02:07:20.597]  I mean, these buildings seem like they're not built by man, but maybe Tartarians, and it's...
[02:07:22.583 --> 02:07:23.924]  We're good to go.
[02:07:23.984 --> 02:07:24.604]  We're good to go.
[02:07:48.157 --> 02:07:49.318]  I think we're good to go.
[02:08:11.900 --> 02:08:19.601]  We were created by God, and who knows what other kind of intelligent life forms or whatever kind of creatures of God may have been here before us as well.
[02:08:20.142 --> 02:08:26.483]  But I kind of want to lean in more to what you were talking about, because you said it, Chase, before the first bomb dropped.
[02:08:26.503 --> 02:08:30.704]  I mean, we used to build beautiful, ornate structures.
[02:08:31.164 --> 02:08:37.905]  I mean, just universal beauty in structure, in architecture, and it's gone now.
[02:08:38.584 --> 02:08:39.425]  Yeah.
[02:08:40.005 --> 02:09:00.906]  One of the theories is that after the nuclear bomb, that was when you started seeing governments all over the world shift from building these impressive, awe-inspiring structures to the cheap DMV structures that we see with the broken chairs and the crummy linoleum tiles and the leaks in the ceiling tiles as well.
[02:09:01.326 --> 02:09:02.227]  We've gone from...
[02:09:03.949 --> 02:09:13.160]  A species who builds things to last beyond our generation to a species that acts as if any generation could be the last generation of the species.
[02:09:16.337 --> 02:09:16.657]  Oh, yeah.
[02:09:16.717 --> 02:09:18.559]  Look at pictures of New York City pre-1900.
[02:09:18.659 --> 02:09:26.144]  I mean, we're talking these people had hand carts and hand tools, but yet they're building these beautiful buildings out of brick and all of these things.
[02:09:26.184 --> 02:09:37.211]  I mean, you could look at World's Fair, and you could look at what Nikola Tesla did in the World's Fair with just that tower of light that he built when transformers weren't powerful enough back then to power that much light.
[02:09:37.271 --> 02:09:46.137]  I mean, all of these things and all of these clues, and we're learning about frequency and vibration and all of that and all the Tesla technology, which in my opinion is just,
[02:09:46.817 --> 02:09:51.179]  Tesla rediscovering Tartarian technology and the frequency and vibration and how important it is.
[02:09:51.279 --> 02:09:58.981]  Well, and a lot of people, they might not know what you mean when you say Tartarian, and maybe they'll understand it better if you talk about ancient Egypt and stuff like that.
[02:09:59.382 --> 02:10:06.564]  But I think that what is observable is that, yes, we don't build these beautiful, ornate structures anymore.
[02:10:06.744 --> 02:10:07.665]  It's undeniable.
[02:10:08.245 --> 02:10:08.605]  Why?
[02:10:08.625 --> 02:10:11.146]  And there is a common thread here, Harrison.
[02:10:12.202 --> 02:10:18.364]  What do terror groups do or occupying groups do or conquering groups do a lot of times when they move into a new territory?
[02:10:18.624 --> 02:10:20.344]  They destroy what was there before them.
[02:10:20.684 --> 02:10:22.385]  And so we see a lot of this in the Middle East.
[02:10:22.445 --> 02:10:23.585]  We see this happening in America.
[02:10:23.625 --> 02:10:28.106]  There was just a group that defecated the United States Constitution.
[02:10:28.206 --> 02:10:33.248]  A leftist group of climate protesters defecated the United States Constitution yesterday at the National Archives.
[02:10:33.288 --> 02:10:37.889]  Now, obviously, it's in a very protected case that only Nicolas Cage could find a way to steal.
[02:10:38.489 --> 02:10:38.609]  But...
[02:10:39.577 --> 02:10:45.561]  I think that, you know, if we want to get deep into this, I mean, it's like, maybe that was architecture built by angels.
[02:10:45.661 --> 02:10:53.627]  Maybe that was architecture built by people more pure, closer to God's original creation intent for us, and now we have all these demons here coming here destroying it.
[02:10:54.603 --> 02:10:55.944]  Well, there's a couple aspects to this.
[02:10:56.325 --> 02:10:57.906]  It's about crushing the human spirit.
[02:10:58.166 --> 02:11:11.796]  The old architecture was very deliberately designed to uplift humanity, to represent something greater than ourselves, to pull us up out of the mire and try to symbolize what we might think heaven is like.
[02:11:11.816 --> 02:11:14.358]  I mean, that's why these people designed these things.
[02:11:14.739 --> 02:11:17.421]  That's how the Greek architecture was designed specifically as well.
[02:11:18.081 --> 02:11:32.013]  So there's an aspect of purposeful dehumanization, and the best example is when they show a prison from 1800, and it looks like the most beautiful building you've ever seen, versus a high school today, and it looks like a concrete block.
[02:11:32.574 --> 02:11:33.394]  It's dehumanizing.
[02:11:33.414 --> 02:11:41.602]  And another image that always comes to my mind is there's somebody who took their cubicle at work that's usually gray and beige and drab and horrifying,
[02:11:42.342 --> 02:11:50.767]  And they just dressed it up to look like the inside of a study, and it's all wood-paneled, and there's a little stuffed animal that looks like it's mounted on the wall.
[02:11:51.148 --> 02:11:56.811]  And suddenly, this sort of dehumanizing cubicle box where you sit and work like a bug, it's nice.
[02:11:56.951 --> 02:11:57.672]  It's human.
[02:11:57.992 --> 02:11:58.652]  It feels good.
[02:11:58.672 --> 02:12:02.495]  So just because something is small doesn't mean it has to feel oppressive.
[02:12:02.755 --> 02:12:06.798]  Just because we have to build a lot of buildings for a lot of people.
[02:12:06.858 --> 02:12:08.859]  So the Klaus Schwab pods can be dressed up?
[02:12:09.079 --> 02:12:10.420]  They can be very nice.
[02:12:10.820 --> 02:12:12.541]  They can also be uplifting.
[02:12:12.741 --> 02:12:17.465]  But the point is that there's a reason they choose everything being gray and beige and drab.
[02:12:17.525 --> 02:12:18.625]  It's because it's oppressive.
[02:12:18.685 --> 02:12:20.387]  It's because it crushes the human spirit.
[02:12:20.747 --> 02:12:21.587]  And that's deliberate.
[02:12:21.647 --> 02:12:27.331]  It's sort of a communistic, as you sort of put it, an invasion of our cultural heritage.
[02:12:27.611 --> 02:12:30.393]  And, you know, there's the term globo-homo, the globo-homo empire.
[02:12:30.593 --> 02:12:32.575]  And people think that has to do with homosexuality.
[02:12:32.655 --> 02:12:33.936]  It's global homogenized.
[02:12:33.956 --> 02:12:35.597]  It's about everybody being homogenized.
[02:12:35.817 --> 02:12:38.639]  You take a picture of a city street and you can't tell whether it's,
[02:12:39.119 --> 02:12:40.801]  Timbuktu or Berlin.
[02:12:41.461 --> 02:12:53.273]  It's about eliminating legitimate cultural human diversity and crushing people into one formless mass that can be taken advantage of because they have nothing to aspire to.
[02:12:53.293 --> 02:12:56.656]  By the way, I went and visited the jail.
[02:12:56.716 --> 02:13:00.300]  It's no longer an operating prison that Shawshank Redemption was shot in.
[02:13:00.420 --> 02:13:01.701]  It really is like a frickin' castle.
[02:13:02.121 --> 02:13:03.363]  Do they have the tunnel still?
[02:13:04.178 --> 02:13:06.600]  It's all still there, but you can only access so much of it.
[02:13:06.660 --> 02:13:08.001]  But, I mean, really, it's like a castle.
[02:13:08.021 --> 02:13:10.043]  I mean, it's a freaking awesome structure.
[02:13:10.443 --> 02:13:10.684]  Yeah.
[02:13:11.004 --> 02:13:19.811]  Well, I mean, it's just every prison movie that takes place before 1920, these facilities... The government didn't want to build facilities back then that they were going to be embarrassed about.
[02:13:19.832 --> 02:13:20.732]  It was almost like a pride thing.
[02:13:20.772 --> 02:13:31.662]  Even if you go back to ancient Greece and ancient Rome, a lot of their famous sort of buildings, whether they were entertainment-related or whether they were religious-related, were actually funded by...
[02:13:32.022 --> 02:13:32.763]  We're good to go.
[02:13:32.783 --> 02:13:32.963]  I think?
[02:13:48.414 --> 02:13:51.075]  Or like the libraries that Carnegie built in New York City.
[02:13:51.095 --> 02:13:58.619]  I mean, those are the most beautiful buildings in the world, and it was about a responsibility that he had, almost a noblesse oblige, right?
[02:13:58.639 --> 02:14:04.122]  The obligation of the noble to leave behind something beneficial for everybody, not just gather it to himself.
[02:14:04.202 --> 02:14:06.303]  Trump Tower.
[02:14:06.323 --> 02:14:08.164]  Like the beauty of Trump Tower, exactly.
[02:14:08.184 --> 02:14:13.526]  Well, he did buy, he ended up selling it, but what used to be Trump International D.C., another beautiful building.
[02:14:13.586 --> 02:14:13.987]  All right, J.P.,
[02:14:14.887 --> 02:14:17.110]  Thank you for that interesting starter there.
[02:14:17.791 --> 02:14:25.760]  Matt, let's go to another individual on our X Spaces, live right now on X. Hey, we've got Real American in the space.
[02:14:26.521 --> 02:14:28.904]  Real American, go ahead and unmute your mic.
[02:14:29.465 --> 02:14:30.326]  Let's hear what you have to say.
[02:14:32.998 --> 02:14:33.819]  Yes, hold on.
[02:14:33.879 --> 02:14:36.901]  I think I have a bead on that spaceship coming over.
[02:14:36.921 --> 02:14:41.364]  No, that's a big red helium balloon.
[02:14:41.404 --> 02:14:41.884]  I'm sorry.
[02:14:41.904 --> 02:14:47.228]  Yeah, they just found like eight Chinese spy balloons over Taiwan, I think, last week or something.
[02:14:48.789 --> 02:14:50.670]  That would be what I would suspect.
[02:14:50.750 --> 02:14:55.033]  If there's a nuclear spaceship, it's probably China's or ours.
[02:14:56.042 --> 02:14:59.364]  And they made us want to try to use it to blame it on Russia.
[02:14:59.925 --> 02:15:03.287]  You know, they're desperate for whatever they can come up with right now.
[02:15:04.107 --> 02:15:07.529]  So I don't believe anything they say, just to be completely honest.
[02:15:09.250 --> 02:15:09.871]  Why would you?
[02:15:09.911 --> 02:15:12.192]  The intelligence communities lied to us our entire lives.
[02:15:12.432 --> 02:15:14.854]  I couldn't even think of something they told me that was honest, actually.
[02:15:16.375 --> 02:15:16.995]  Exactly.
[02:15:17.075 --> 02:15:23.279]  I think every president we've had since Kennedy, except for Reagan, was already put in jail.
[02:15:23.968 --> 02:15:24.809]  They put them in.
[02:15:24.929 --> 02:15:28.871]  I think Reagan was a mistake and Trump was a mistake.
[02:15:29.631 --> 02:15:34.454]  Well, you know, Reagan... I actually have some interesting personal anecdote.
[02:15:34.795 --> 02:15:39.798]  So there's a guy in Houston who, major libertarian donor, has been for decades and decades.
[02:15:39.918 --> 02:15:43.420]  He's an older guy now, healthiest dude you'll ever meet because he drinks apple cider vinegar all day.
[02:15:43.860 --> 02:15:47.282]  But he's helped Infowars quite a bit and he's helped Ron Paul get his start.
[02:15:47.642 --> 02:15:51.765]  He told me that in the 80s, he was a big fan of Reagan and he told Reagan...
[02:15:52.065 --> 02:15:52.765]  And then they tried to kill him.
[02:16:14.836 --> 02:16:16.198]  And then they shot him in the gut.
[02:16:16.218 --> 02:16:16.878]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:16:16.938 --> 02:16:22.004]  So I think you're right about Reagan being a fluke, and they had a way of dealing with him.
[02:16:22.725 --> 02:16:24.346]  Unfortunately for them, he survived.
[02:16:24.967 --> 02:16:31.874]  And boy, did they make sure there was never any more Reagan populist victory in a presidential election ever again.
[02:16:32.495 --> 02:16:45.401]  You know, when I think about our recent history, whether it's JFK or Reagan or others, it's gotten to the point almost where if you don't get assassinated, it's because you didn't try hard enough.
[02:16:45.941 --> 02:16:49.623]  Or maybe the censorship or the lawsuit first.
[02:16:49.723 --> 02:16:50.263]  Right, right.
[02:16:50.303 --> 02:16:51.464]  Well, that's where it starts, man.
[02:16:51.504 --> 02:16:52.844]  But we're on the way.
[02:16:52.884 --> 02:16:58.647]  But if I don't get assassinated, I'm going to feel like I didn't fight hard enough because it's getting to that point where everything is so corrupt that...
[02:16:59.955 --> 02:17:00.916]  That's what they do to people.
[02:17:00.956 --> 02:17:01.377]  They kill you.
[02:17:01.397 --> 02:17:09.187]  And they're doing everything they can with Trump, in my opinion, to kill him without literally killing him because they know literally killing him is going to have astronomical amount of blowback.
[02:17:09.627 --> 02:17:14.794]  But I think as a last resort, I don't think it's wild speculation to think that something terrible might happen to him.
[02:17:14.834 --> 02:17:15.395]  I'm worried about it.
[02:17:15.595 --> 02:17:34.062]  Well, the good news is, like you said, and who knows, I'm sure that some people would love to see Trump no longer in the picture, but really there's so many other populist leaders waiting in the wings, like a Vivek Ramaswamy, that they know that it would actually just enhance the flavor of Trump, even if he wasn't there.
[02:17:34.722 --> 02:17:36.323]  Real American, thank you for weighing in.
[02:17:36.363 --> 02:17:39.824]  Matt, let's take our next individual on X Spaces.
[02:17:41.105 --> 02:17:43.406]  Next up, we've got the Punchbowl.
[02:17:44.269 --> 02:17:46.050]  Rushball, go ahead and unmute your mic.
[02:17:48.171 --> 02:17:48.752]  What's going on?
[02:17:49.392 --> 02:17:50.773]  Hang on, bring up no Tartaria.
[02:17:50.793 --> 02:17:56.536]  I was going to go and say that this story is broke by mainstream media.
[02:17:56.716 --> 02:18:02.059]  So when I was in the military, we trained to fight Russians, the Cold War doctrine.
[02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:10.144]  So I think the mainstream media is running to keep the narrative with Russia after Tucker Carlson's interview.
[02:18:10.905 --> 02:18:14.890]  But, whatever sauce you guys got on the nukes, I mean, I'm all game for it.
[02:18:14.910 --> 02:18:18.415]  Well, we're going to hear from Alex on that coming up in about 15 minutes.
[02:18:18.775 --> 02:18:23.141]  But you bring up the Cold War, and I mean, credit to Obama, because I would agree with him.
[02:18:23.742 --> 02:18:25.644]  When he was debating Mitt Romney
[02:18:26.667 --> 02:18:27.028]  We're good to go.
[02:18:42.208 --> 02:18:42.408]  Punchbowl.
[02:19:02.468 --> 02:19:06.249]  What I'm seeing here is that we really don't know what Russia is.
[02:19:07.929 --> 02:19:10.370]  We have to follow this narrative that Russia is bad.
[02:19:11.330 --> 02:19:13.911]  Even if you're on the left, you know Russia is bad.
[02:19:14.091 --> 02:19:16.031]  On the right, we're like, what the hell?
[02:19:16.911 --> 02:19:19.432]  We don't know which direction to follow with this.
[02:19:19.772 --> 02:19:30.474]  After Tucker's interview, he put a whole bunch of conspiracies that we've been talking about for three to four years, five, six years, kind of put them
[02:19:36.937 --> 02:19:45.481]  I don't think it's coincidence that that interview happened a week before this bombshell report has leaked about Russian nukes.
[02:19:45.501 --> 02:19:55.026]  I think Putin knew that this was going to happen, that the deep state here was planning it, and that's one of the reasons why he elected to have that conversation with Tucker at the time that he did.
[02:19:56.024 --> 02:20:01.548]  Well, I'll say, going back to Obama, remember, it was under Obama that Hillary Clinton went over there with the reset button.
[02:20:01.568 --> 02:20:02.088]  Y'all remember that?
[02:20:02.128 --> 02:20:06.091]  She had a reset button, and it was all... Because this is the way that the globalists work.
[02:20:06.131 --> 02:20:08.272]  It's kind of like how vampires work.
[02:20:08.712 --> 02:20:14.396]  First, they'll offer to let you come along willingly, and then if you don't, that's when they activate the warfare, right?
[02:20:14.736 --> 02:20:17.718]  So I think under Obama, it was like, no, we're friends with Russia.
[02:20:17.778 --> 02:20:18.699]  Come along with us.
[02:20:18.819 --> 02:20:20.300]  Join the globalist combine.
[02:20:20.540 --> 02:20:24.523]  And then when Russia refused that and said no, they went, okay, now we're playing dirty.
[02:20:25.083 --> 02:20:28.644]  And, man, the most important part, I think Punchbowl just hit the nail on the head.
[02:20:29.084 --> 02:20:38.047]  It was the fact that Putin was like, presidents would say one thing, and we would agree, and then they'd come back two hours later and say, gee, actually, we can't do that anymore.
[02:20:38.587 --> 02:20:52.551]  Obviously, the president is not the one making the decision at the end of the day, and I got the feeling that it was like the people in charge, the intelligence agencies, I'm sure, the State Department, these permanent deep state bureaucrats, they almost wanted to keep Russia in the wing as like...
[02:20:53.291 --> 02:20:54.372]  Because they always need an enemy.
[02:20:54.532 --> 02:20:55.793]  They can't have world peace.
[02:20:55.813 --> 02:20:58.875]  They can't have all the countries getting together.
[02:20:58.935 --> 02:21:12.363]  So even though there was no reason to exclude Russia from NATO, no reason to exclude Russia from cooperation with the missile program, they didn't want to make Russia too friendly because they needed them in the wing as a potential enemy later.
[02:21:12.503 --> 02:21:18.847]  Well, remember, that was part of the equation why the deep state hated Trump so much, because he wouldn't listen to the intelligence communities.
[02:21:19.268 --> 02:21:24.952]  And they wrote all these articles crying and bitching and moaning about how Trump wouldn't listen to the intelligence communities.
[02:21:25.452 --> 02:21:28.294]  Yeah, because he wanted to be the president of the United States.
[02:21:28.454 --> 02:21:30.255]  He wanted to be the chief executive.
[02:21:30.315 --> 02:21:32.077]  He knew he could only trust himself.
[02:21:32.737 --> 02:21:39.699]  And so that was their big beef was like, oh, well, gee, remember Chuck Schumer with the big gangster mafia threatening message on MSNBC?
[02:21:40.019 --> 02:21:42.179]  You go against the intelligence communities.
[02:21:42.199 --> 02:21:44.780]  They got six ways a Sunday of getting back at you.
[02:21:44.820 --> 02:21:46.760]  I'm dirty, dirty Chuck Schumer.
[02:21:46.780 --> 02:21:48.281]  I'm going to get you a country into war.
[02:21:48.801 --> 02:21:54.082]  I'm glad that Annapolino Luna wrote the Schumer bill, meaning if you sign the country into war, you go first, Chuck.
[02:21:54.962 --> 02:21:56.283]  So that was always a beef there.
[02:21:56.323 --> 02:21:59.385]  So, I mean, had the intelligence communities really been running the country?
[02:21:59.805 --> 02:22:10.452]  Well, and remember, the first thing Trump did when he got into office, the first thing he did on Inauguration Day, he went to the CIA headquarters and went right into their lobby and stood there and gave him a speech going, I'm your president now.
[02:22:10.933 --> 02:22:11.593]  I'm in charge.
[02:22:11.633 --> 02:22:19.518]  That was a signal to them saying, first of all, I'm not your enemy, but second of all, I'm going to walk right into your HQ and there's nothing you can do about it because I'm the boss now and you have to listen to me.
[02:22:19.539 --> 02:22:20.259]  Obviously they loved it.
[02:22:20.779 --> 02:22:21.420]  And they, well, they...
[02:22:21.860 --> 02:22:24.486]  Well, they were like, well, yeah, we've been spying on you for two years.
[02:22:24.506 --> 02:22:25.829]  That is such a relief.
[02:22:26.190 --> 02:22:27.974]  Donald, thank you so much for coming by.
[02:22:29.898 --> 02:22:31.679]  Not really, but more of like a power move.
[02:22:31.719 --> 02:22:37.101]  More of like a, hey, I know you guys have been screwing with me, but I just won this election, so I'm in charge now.
[02:22:37.321 --> 02:22:41.803]  Oh, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, and thank you for the way in here, Punchbowl.
[02:22:41.903 --> 02:22:54.029]  I'm telling you, the big thing that some people are starting to see now, it's kind of like, if you can read between the lines, the whole Trump documents raid was they are looking for the documents Trump has on the Obama spy ring.
[02:22:54.409 --> 02:22:55.309]  That's what this is.
[02:22:55.630 --> 02:22:57.010]  Trump has the documents.
[02:22:57.410 --> 02:22:58.291]  Maybe he does, maybe he doesn't.
[02:22:59.207 --> 02:23:00.448]  Trump says he does this to everybody.
[02:23:22.688 --> 02:23:24.828]  He's like, look, leave me alone.
[02:23:25.269 --> 02:23:28.929]  Just leave me alone, and I won't expose you damn crooks and criminals.
[02:23:28.989 --> 02:23:32.770]  But fine, now it's like, okay, the game of chicken, we're like two inches apart.
[02:23:33.010 --> 02:23:38.011]  All right, Matt, let's take another individual on X. Next up, we've got Phil.
[02:23:38.431 --> 02:23:40.792]  Philip Grillo, go ahead and unmute your mic.
[02:23:40.812 --> 02:23:44.552]  How you doing, guys?
[02:23:44.612 --> 02:23:47.173]  I just wanted to first off hit a plug.
[02:23:49.150 --> 02:23:50.091]  Products are amazing.
[02:23:50.191 --> 02:23:55.195]  Like, I take bodies and brain force and...
[02:23:56.227 --> 02:23:59.009]  Super Vitality Mail, that needs to come back here soon.
[02:24:00.050 --> 02:24:03.213]  But this whole Russia thing is a complete psy-op.
[02:24:03.533 --> 02:24:07.716]  They want us to keep focusing our hate towards Russia and what Russia is doing.
[02:24:08.177 --> 02:24:18.245]  Meanwhile, Russia is just trying to get order of what used to be in their country, put an end to Nazis, and denazify Ukraine.
[02:24:18.365 --> 02:24:20.747]  Meanwhile, we're supporting Ukraine.
[02:24:21.187 --> 02:24:25.431]  So we can see our inheritance being stolen by this
[02:24:26.286 --> 02:24:35.072]  fraudulent government that is running under the guise of law when they aren't themselves acting lawfully.
[02:24:35.092 --> 02:24:38.734]  They're actually working legally, but not lawfully.
[02:24:39.034 --> 02:24:39.935]  There is a difference.
[02:24:40.495 --> 02:24:45.579]  I encourage everybody to get themselves a copy of the Black's Law Dictionary.
[02:24:45.599 --> 02:24:47.220]  Start learning your rights.
[02:24:48.100 --> 02:24:58.123]  Get yourself a copy of the USC codes and really start reading all these different codes that they have put in place for us to live under their system.
[02:24:58.483 --> 02:25:01.884]  But I'll yield and give the floor to whoever else needs to weigh in.
[02:25:02.324 --> 02:25:04.845]  And God bless and thank you for what you're doing.
[02:25:05.545 --> 02:25:06.605]  All right, Phillip, thank you.
[02:25:06.785 --> 02:25:07.946]  Matt, let's go to the next.
[02:25:08.986 --> 02:25:11.787]  Our next speaker up to bat, we've got Lala.
[02:25:12.367 --> 02:25:14.448]  Lala, go ahead and unmute your mic.
[02:25:14.468 --> 02:25:15.588]  Let's hear what you got to say.
[02:25:17.017 --> 02:25:17.597]  Hi, guys.
[02:25:18.037 --> 02:25:20.318]  I think Philip said things very perfectly.
[02:25:20.378 --> 02:25:22.298]  It's just another division tactic.
[02:25:22.958 --> 02:25:27.319]  And we need to be concentrating more on things like what happened in Maui.
[02:25:27.899 --> 02:25:29.520]  Same thing happened in Chile now.
[02:25:29.720 --> 02:25:31.920]  Where are these planes leaving from?
[02:25:31.980 --> 02:25:33.081]  Where are they going to?
[02:25:33.701 --> 02:25:34.501]  Things like this.
[02:25:34.641 --> 02:25:37.602]  Because what happened in Maui has happened in Chile.
[02:25:37.622 --> 02:25:39.102]  It was the same thing in California.
[02:25:39.762 --> 02:25:47.088]  So we need to stop looking at all the division tactics and focus where things we can actually see.
[02:25:47.488 --> 02:25:51.471]  I've never seen a nuke, but I've seen these fires with the blue roofs.
[02:25:51.652 --> 02:25:54.074]  And the blue roofs and all that is the same internally.
[02:25:54.634 --> 02:25:55.855]  So yeah, I just want to say that.
[02:25:55.895 --> 02:25:57.556]  And Phillip, excellent points.
[02:25:58.337 --> 02:25:59.458]  You guys want to respond to that?
[02:26:00.667 --> 02:26:01.267]  No, I think you're right.
[02:26:01.287 --> 02:26:03.968]  I haven't looked as much into Chile as I probably should.
[02:26:03.988 --> 02:26:05.608]  Can you maybe tell us a little bit about that?
[02:26:05.628 --> 02:26:24.832]  Obviously, we looked a lot into Maui, and we were actually probably the first to break the fact that there was something suspicious about the Maui fires, because on the day it happened, we had a caller from Maui who was saying that his air conditioning was burning while the bush around his air conditioning wasn't, you know, pointing to some unnatural fire activity.
[02:26:25.372 --> 02:26:29.493]  But Chile exhibiting some of the same suspicious things, Lala?
[02:26:31.619 --> 02:26:33.260]  Yeah, Chile, it was the same thing.
[02:26:33.681 --> 02:26:39.525]  A blue house was completely untouched, and the trees around it, of course, were untouched.
[02:26:41.006 --> 02:26:42.688]  It was the exact same thing.
[02:26:43.088 --> 02:26:44.229]  Cars incinerated.
[02:26:44.249 --> 02:26:49.273]  I haven't been able to find out if they were trapped in by the authorities the same way yet.
[02:26:49.373 --> 02:26:50.314]  I haven't found that out.
[02:26:51.134 --> 02:26:56.236]  All right, let's try to squeeze one more individual in before we go to break and hear from Alex on the other side.
[02:26:56.276 --> 02:26:58.157]  Matt, let's get one more in.
[02:26:58.257 --> 02:27:00.438]  All right, it looks like we've got Michael Sullivan.
[02:27:00.458 --> 02:27:01.959]  Michael Sullivan, we just made you a speaker.
[02:27:20.186 --> 02:27:21.526]  Go ahead and take your mic on.
[02:27:23.567 --> 02:27:24.427]  Okay, can you hear me?
[02:27:24.667 --> 02:27:24.867]  Yeah.
[02:27:26.788 --> 02:27:34.190]  Okay, well, I think we're all kind of shooting in the dark until Alex's report as far as Russia and the satellites.
[02:27:34.790 --> 02:27:38.611]  But as far as the greatest threat, man, I would have to say us.
[02:27:38.691 --> 02:27:40.852]  And I am so ashamed to have to say that, but...
[02:27:41.667 --> 02:27:50.053]  Since we've been kind of taken over, like I said with Chase earlier, Klaus Schwab boasts that he's taken over half the governments of the world.
[02:27:50.513 --> 02:27:51.894]  We have to look at ourselves.
[02:27:51.914 --> 02:27:54.596]  We've got to take the forest out of our own eye.
[02:27:55.157 --> 02:27:58.739]  And we've got Klaus Schwab taking over the Democrats and the RINOs.
[02:28:00.600 --> 02:28:04.763]  Let's just pause right there, because let's not even go into Klaus Schwab.
[02:28:05.124 --> 02:28:08.286]  And I appreciate you bringing this up, Michael, because here's the element of truth.
[02:28:08.806 --> 02:28:12.487]  I can be told how bad Russian leadership is, or this leadership, or that leadership.
[02:28:13.287 --> 02:28:14.888]  Well, okay, that might be true, it might not.
[02:28:15.228 --> 02:28:17.228]  I got a psychotic Chuck Schumer.
[02:28:17.448 --> 02:28:18.969]  I got a psychotic Lindsey Graham.
[02:28:19.189 --> 02:28:21.370]  I have psychos in the media calling for genocide.
[02:28:21.410 --> 02:28:21.890]  No, you're right.
[02:28:21.950 --> 02:28:26.631]  We have our own problems here that I know of in my front yard, in my backyard.
[02:28:27.011 --> 02:28:36.754]  Yeah, it's like that old quote, the black guy going, no Vietnam ever called me the N-word, no Vietnamese ever, you know, no Russian ever tried to make my kid trans.
[02:28:37.654 --> 02:28:37.994]  Chase?
[02:28:38.074 --> 02:28:39.475]  Yeah, it's absolutely crazy.
[02:28:39.495 --> 02:28:44.259]  What I said the other day is that we shouldn't trust Putin as much as we trust our own politicians.
[02:28:44.559 --> 02:28:47.681]  We should distrust our own politicians as much as we distrust Putin.
[02:28:47.701 --> 02:28:48.061]  There you go.
[02:28:48.942 --> 02:28:49.322]  All right.
[02:28:49.863 --> 02:28:55.306]  Report from Alex Jones on Russian space nukes coming up on the other side of this break.
[02:28:55.326 --> 02:28:55.807]  Stay right there.
[02:28:58.402 --> 02:28:59.022]  I'm not perfect.
[02:28:59.062 --> 02:28:59.862]  I'm under a lot of stress.
[02:28:59.882 --> 02:29:04.103]  But if I didn't have the supplements we have, we promote, I wouldn't be able to continue to be on air.
[02:29:04.704 --> 02:29:12.805]  And when you go to InfoWarsStore.com, you are funding the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists in an operation that the enemy admits has been the most effective at exposing them.
[02:29:13.026 --> 02:29:14.626]  Because we're fearless and we don't back down.
[02:29:14.986 --> 02:29:16.046]  We got God on our side.
[02:29:16.266 --> 02:29:17.767]  But God needs to work through you.
[02:29:18.107 --> 02:29:22.128]  You've got to make the decision to get great products you already need at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:29:22.168 --> 02:29:23.408]  And that is a 360 win.
[02:29:23.988 --> 02:29:26.969]  Nitric Boost, without me even knowing, became our number three bestseller.
[02:29:27.669 --> 02:29:28.330]  We're good to go.
[02:29:45.090 --> 02:29:47.492]  So I could never offer nitric boosters.
[02:29:47.512 --> 02:29:48.994]  It cost us so much to make.
[02:29:49.794 --> 02:29:51.996]  And now we can offer it for 40% off.
[02:29:52.557 --> 02:29:56.340]  Infowarsstore.com nitric boost finally back in stock.
[02:29:56.360 --> 02:29:57.942]  40% off out of the gates.
[02:29:59.366 --> 02:30:00.007]  We're good to go.
[02:30:22.583 --> 02:30:23.364]  We're good to go.
[02:30:41.801 --> 02:30:46.646]  29 years on air, all I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalists.
[02:31:03.662 --> 02:31:08.965]  And I've done the best job I can to tell those words that have been accurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[02:31:09.366 --> 02:31:11.927]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves.
[02:31:12.347 --> 02:31:16.730]  Unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people, we don't do that.
[02:31:17.190 --> 02:31:19.091]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[02:31:19.452 --> 02:31:21.473]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product.
[02:31:21.533 --> 02:31:22.153]  It's so powerful.
[02:31:23.054 --> 02:31:28.017]  This is the breakdown product, after your cells process it, of folic acid.
[02:31:28.617 --> 02:31:31.499]  Methylfolate with high-quality organic...
[02:31:32.279 --> 02:31:33.059]  Be complex.
[02:31:33.540 --> 02:31:34.800]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[02:31:34.820 --> 02:31:35.660]  It's not a stimulant.
[02:31:35.920 --> 02:31:37.821]  It energizes your cells.
[02:31:38.301 --> 02:31:40.822]  And then everything else you take just supercharges it.
[02:31:40.862 --> 02:31:41.702]  It's so insane.
[02:31:42.023 --> 02:31:43.563]  It's foundational energy.
[02:31:44.003 --> 02:31:48.165]  The strongest formula out there at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:31:48.525 --> 02:31:51.386]  It doesn't just energize this operation against the tyrants.
[02:31:51.466 --> 02:31:52.586]  It energizes you.
[02:31:52.866 --> 02:31:54.267]  Get foundational energy now.
[02:31:59.266 --> 02:32:11.071]  We are in the middle of a crude and ugly communist revolution funded by the big banks as a battering ram into a new age digital economy and a total surveillance state.
[02:32:11.531 --> 02:32:17.013]  All branches of government are attacking we the people and they offer us only one option.
[02:32:17.313 --> 02:32:19.534]  A meaningless vote in a rigged election.
[02:32:20.414 --> 02:32:21.275]  We're good to go.
[02:32:43.124 --> 02:32:46.747]  Share them, upload them, and send them everywhere.
[02:32:47.427 --> 02:32:51.049]  Let the world unite for truth, justice, and 1776 worldwide.
[02:33:11.440 --> 02:33:16.623]  Are the globalists preparing a nuclear-triggered EMP false flag to be blamed on Russia?
[02:33:17.123 --> 02:33:18.283]  You bet your ass they are.
[02:33:21.925 --> 02:33:24.587]  Here, an artist's projection of the president's vision.
[02:33:27.008 --> 02:33:32.911]  Fanning into space, a layered defense to protect the country from nuclear devastation.
[02:33:33.511 --> 02:33:33.791]  U.S.
[02:33:33.831 --> 02:33:39.274]  spy satellites would watch the world below, detect Soviet missiles blasting off,
[02:33:40.282 --> 02:33:43.312]  Compute the position and speed of each missile.
[02:33:43.452 --> 02:33:45.820]  Alert battle stations in space, on Earth.
[02:33:47.601 --> 02:33:50.523]  Is Russia developing nuclear-powered lasers?
[02:33:50.723 --> 02:33:52.364]  Are they deploying them in space?
[02:33:52.965 --> 02:33:55.026]  And the answer is undoubtedly yes.
[02:33:55.647 --> 02:33:58.429]  But guess who was doing this even back in the 1970s?
[02:33:58.829 --> 02:34:00.910]  And it perfected it by the 1980s and 90s.
[02:34:01.371 --> 02:34:02.311]  The United States.
[02:34:02.952 --> 02:34:11.198]  And as usual, everybody's running around, even mainstream media governments, acting like they don't know what's going on to scare the public when there's a very...
[02:34:12.438 --> 02:34:16.561]  Exactly what's going on with the United States, Russia, China, and other governments.
[02:34:16.901 --> 02:34:20.884]  So I'm about to break down what's really happening in space straight ahead.
[02:34:21.665 --> 02:34:22.845]  The first response.
[02:34:23.506 --> 02:34:33.253]  Space-based kinetic energy weapons fire high-speed projectiles from hypervelocity guns, intercepting enemy missiles as they are boosted through the atmosphere.
[02:34:35.063 --> 02:34:42.388]  Popped up into space, Earth-based nuclear-powered X-ray lasers fire their radioactive rays.
[02:34:44.990 --> 02:34:51.074]  Attack rays from land-based Examer lasers are redirected by huge mirrors orbiting in space.
[02:34:52.275 --> 02:34:58.459]  Chemical lasers fire beams that burn through the shell of the onrushing missile.
[02:35:00.300 --> 02:35:03.643]  Particle beam weapons with pulsing rays join the attack.
[02:35:05.271 --> 02:35:09.459]  Still over the atmosphere, the missile bust ejects its cargo.
[02:35:09.719 --> 02:35:11.202]  Multiple nuclear warheads.
[02:35:20.191 --> 02:35:25.453]  Ronald Reagan popularized Star Wars, or the Strategic Defense Initiative, in the 1980s.
[02:35:25.493 --> 02:35:27.294]  But it was really going on since the 1960s.
[02:35:27.794 --> 02:35:29.755]  And by the 1970s, it's declassified.
[02:35:30.175 --> 02:35:33.317]  The United States have powerful lasers mounted in space.
[02:35:33.957 --> 02:35:40.320]  Some of them, what are called X-ray lasers, that are powered by a nuclear power plant.
[02:35:40.800 --> 02:35:45.921]  Earth-based nuclear-powered X-ray lasers fire their radioactive rays.
[02:35:46.401 --> 02:35:59.925]  In many cases, they would actually detonate a small atomic or hydrogen bomb that then fires through the X-ray laser arrays and just fries everything in a massive radius around it.
[02:36:00.845 --> 02:36:05.571]  This would also cause major electromagnetic disturbances in the atmosphere.
[02:36:06.111 --> 02:36:16.003]  That's why the Pentagon back in the 1960s did Operation Fishbowl, where they tried to detonate the upper atmosphere with high-powered hydrogen bombs just to test and see if it was safe.
[02:36:16.544 --> 02:36:17.024]  We're good to go.
[02:36:17.044 --> 02:36:17.184]  I think?
[02:36:35.954 --> 02:36:40.316]  In function, already in operation by the 1970s, heavily deployed by the 1980s.
[02:36:40.356 --> 02:36:49.160]  One of the reasons the Russians gave up and the Soviet Union collapsed because they understood the United States was so much farther advanced than them.
[02:36:49.600 --> 02:36:52.181]  So why is this all coming out now?
[02:36:52.682 --> 02:37:02.146]  Why is the Pentagon and the White House all mysteriously, oh, we're not going to say if they have a weapon or what it is, but it's probably nukes in space and nukes that power lasers.
[02:37:03.462 --> 02:37:07.104]  It's because they're ratcheting up a new cold and probably hot war with Russia.
[02:37:07.965 --> 02:37:13.628]  The EU, the NATO leaders are saying it's going to be a 20-30 year long-term war.
[02:37:14.128 --> 02:37:17.070]  They're going to bring back national conscription in Europe and the UK.
[02:37:18.294 --> 02:37:32.458]  They're setting their entire political future while they make us eat bugs and own nothing and have nothing and be happy on using the outside threat of Russia as the pretext for domestic crackdowns and control here at home.
[02:37:32.798 --> 02:37:38.900]  So I've been watching this Russian space laser hysteria for days and just sitting back and wondering
[02:37:39.520 --> 02:37:40.220]  We're good to go.
[02:38:08.035 --> 02:38:08.736]  We're good to go.
[02:38:27.173 --> 02:38:28.455]  We're good.
[02:38:43.673 --> 02:39:02.002]  But when you go up to space, there's no water vapor or condensation in the air, so lasers can shoot hundreds of thousands of miles at light speed, not just 50, 60, 70 miles, because depending on where you are in the atmosphere and how much humidity there is, lasers aren't effective out of the distance because, again, they have to fire through the atmosphere.
[02:39:02.282 --> 02:39:05.364]  So the United States has huge weapons platforms in space.
[02:39:06.124 --> 02:39:08.826]  They have nuclear-powered X-ray lasers that can launch from the ground.
[02:39:09.086 --> 02:39:11.547]  That has missiles that go up and detonate X-ray lasers.
[02:39:12.107 --> 02:39:12.628]  Basically...
[02:39:13.948 --> 02:39:20.010]  It's an X-ray laser form of an EMP that knocks out all the communications and systems.
[02:39:20.730 --> 02:39:29.233]  And the reason that they've kept a lot of this classified is the world would get upset to know that a lot of these, quote, secret payloads, 80% of NASA's payloads, have been classified.
[02:39:29.533 --> 02:39:35.955]  We've got all these space planes constantly taking off and landing, and what they're doing is carrying all sorts of classified payloads in.
[02:39:36.335 --> 02:39:37.615]  So there's a couple big stories here.
[02:39:37.635 --> 02:39:39.816]  The United States had this decades and decades and decades ago.
[02:39:40.436 --> 02:39:40.917]  We're good to go.
[02:39:58.258 --> 02:39:59.139]  We're good to go.
[02:39:59.159 --> 02:39:59.439]  I think?
[02:40:27.851 --> 02:40:34.914]  There are weapons systems put in space 50 years ago, 40 years ago, 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, last year, this year.
[02:40:35.275 --> 02:40:39.757]  And the United States is way ahead when it comes to space-based weapons.
[02:40:39.957 --> 02:40:44.899]  That's why Trump officially launched Space Force and the other branches of the military made fun of it.
[02:40:45.239 --> 02:40:50.822]  That was to divert the public from the fact that it's probably the most effective military system the United States happens.
[02:40:51.142 --> 02:40:57.265]  So as usual, you're getting tomorrow's news today as this debate unfolds, as this disclosure unfolds.
[02:40:57.785 --> 02:40:58.606]  The final minute.
[02:41:24.260 --> 02:41:30.492]  The surviving warheads enter the atmosphere above the United States, are attacked by laser-equipped planes.
[02:41:31.534 --> 02:41:35.622]  Earth-based lasers and ABM rockets eliminate the last warheads.
[02:41:38.244 --> 02:41:40.886]  Finally, you've gotten a brief history of these weapons systems.
[02:41:41.406 --> 02:41:46.470]  We've explained the fact that these are existing technologies that any advanced government or corporation could deploy.
[02:41:47.170 --> 02:41:55.256]  But finally, they're not just hyping all this up for war hysteria with Russia, just like we saw with Russiagate and Trump and all the rest of it.
[02:41:55.876 --> 02:41:59.057]  The most important point of all these incredibly important points is this.
[02:41:59.637 --> 02:42:12.319]  The globalists have been hyping for three years that Russia is going to launch an EMP and knock out the power grid in America, or they're going to work with, quote, Trump supporters and knock out the power grid ahead of the 2024 election.
[02:42:12.720 --> 02:42:14.500]  Now, who really believes that?
[02:42:14.800 --> 02:42:24.082]  But now we're being told of this magic power up in the sky any time that could do all these incredibly bad things, and it's all classified so they can't tell us.
[02:42:24.943 --> 02:42:27.225]  Ladies and gentlemen, big things are already happening.
[02:42:27.265 --> 02:42:28.306]  Even bigger things are coming.
[02:42:28.786 --> 02:42:32.710]  And we have been predicting that they might pull something like this and false flag Russia.
[02:42:32.970 --> 02:42:34.732]  So we need to expose this right now.
[02:42:35.052 --> 02:42:37.614]  And all of you need to research the claims I've made in this video.
[02:42:38.015 --> 02:42:38.955]  Find out it's true.
[02:42:39.336 --> 02:42:40.216]  Send it to Congress.
[02:42:40.256 --> 02:42:40.937]  Send it to the Senate.
[02:42:40.977 --> 02:42:41.738]  Send it to your governors.
[02:42:42.098 --> 02:42:42.879]  Send it to NASA.
[02:42:42.919 --> 02:42:43.539]  Send it to others.
[02:42:43.800 --> 02:42:52.027]  And let's get scientists and other experts to come out and explain that the road we're on is a road to something as bad as biblical Armageddon.
[02:42:55.492 --> 02:43:00.694]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:43:01.174 --> 02:43:05.436]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[02:43:07.177 --> 02:43:08.557]  Zach, this is Crystal Palace.
[02:43:08.697 --> 02:43:10.418]  Ignorant has declared DEFCON 3.
[02:43:10.858 --> 02:43:12.159]  Scramble all alert aircraft.
[02:43:12.679 --> 02:43:14.480]  I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.
[02:43:16.212 --> 02:43:20.094]  The Whopper spends all its time thinking about World War III.
[02:43:20.634 --> 02:43:22.115]  Target selection complete.
[02:43:22.155 --> 02:43:23.996]  Time on target sequence complete.
[02:43:24.016 --> 02:43:30.919]  22 Typhoon-class submarines departing Petropavlovsk, turning south out of Nordkapp, bearing 095 degrees.
[02:43:31.199 --> 02:43:36.682]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan Air Defense Zone.
[02:43:37.062 --> 02:43:43.425]  From the front lines of the Information War... Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode.
[02:43:43.505 --> 02:43:44.846]  We are at DEFCON 1.
[02:43:47.285 --> 02:43:49.508]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[02:43:49.528 --> 02:43:50.109]  You bet!
[02:43:50.669 --> 02:43:54.814]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:43:54.974 --> 02:43:57.938]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[02:43:58.639 --> 02:44:01.662]  Three, two, one.
[02:44:02.684 --> 02:44:03.084]  Impact.
[02:44:03.384 --> 02:44:05.287]  Shall we play a game?
[02:44:05.487 --> 02:44:06.068]  Power down.
[02:44:11.388 --> 02:44:15.931]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:44:16.231 --> 02:44:18.212]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready.
[02:44:18.513 --> 02:44:19.353]  Awaiting launch codes.
[02:44:19.933 --> 02:44:21.294]  We are in launch mode.
[02:44:21.715 --> 02:44:22.375]  Do you really?
[02:44:25.621 --> 02:44:29.585]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:44:30.026 --> 02:44:30.406]  We're in.
[02:44:31.527 --> 02:44:32.829]  Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[02:44:33.289 --> 02:44:35.812]  We have a Soviet submarine launch detection.
[02:44:35.832 --> 02:44:37.534]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[02:44:37.894 --> 02:44:39.355]  I wish I was like everybody else.
[02:44:39.836 --> 02:44:40.877]  Change began.
[02:44:41.438 --> 02:44:43.640]  The only winning move is not.
[02:44:55.971 --> 02:44:57.752]  When you have U.S.
[02:44:57.812 --> 02:45:07.459]  senators in both parties saying we may need to go ahead and nuke Russia first, and the Russians are aware that's almost happened before, what do you think that makes the Russians do?
[02:45:07.759 --> 02:45:09.260]  Well, it makes them go into war mode.
[02:45:12.142 --> 02:45:13.663]  So I don't like them invading Ukraine.
[02:45:13.723 --> 02:45:17.125]  I don't like him putting his nuclear forces on maximum alert.
[02:45:17.485 --> 02:45:21.728]  Only one level above that on their DEFCON, just like our system, and that's fire the weapons.
[02:45:22.720 --> 02:45:29.365]  And so now we have Democrats all over the news saying, let's just use nuclear weapons on Russia.
[02:45:29.785 --> 02:45:31.106]  Think of their ignorance.
[02:45:31.807 --> 02:45:41.034]  Russia has hundreds of submarines off our coast with sea-launched missiles that would vaporize our cities within five minutes on average of being launched.
[02:45:41.594 --> 02:45:45.840]  Sea-launched cruise missiles that fly at Mach 5.
[02:45:45.880 --> 02:45:51.187]  Land-launched systems they can also launch from ships that are at Mach 9 and cannot be shot down.
[02:45:51.688 --> 02:45:53.370]  And yes, the United States has those too.
[02:45:54.707 --> 02:45:57.888]  That's a Pentagon lie that Russia developed systems that we don't have.
[02:45:58.208 --> 02:45:59.208]  It's on record the U.S.
[02:45:59.248 --> 02:46:00.428]  has those systems.
[02:46:00.468 --> 02:46:05.509]  The point is, it's called mutually assured destruction or mad for a reason.
[02:46:06.369 --> 02:46:09.630]  Because anyone that would violate the mad doctrine is insane.
[02:46:10.650 --> 02:46:12.830]  And you know, I'm on the side of not having a nuclear war.
[02:46:13.570 --> 02:46:15.291]  Especially when Russia's not starting a fight with us.
[02:46:15.571 --> 02:46:21.592]  And especially after we just heard for years that everything happening in this country is run by Russia when that was all a giant lie.
[02:46:21.772 --> 02:46:23.472]  The globalists are the outside evil force.
[02:46:31.776 --> 02:46:40.080]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[02:46:40.200 --> 02:46:49.204]  Alex Jones, the four-way conspiracy theorist who is apparently... It's Alex Jones!
[02:46:49.364 --> 02:46:50.465]  Scum!
[02:46:50.545 --> 02:46:51.485]  Russian scum!
[02:46:51.505 --> 02:46:51.725]  Scum!
[02:47:00.945 --> 02:47:02.026]  Until wars come to mind.
[02:47:06.209 --> 02:47:07.569]  Reputation's amazing.
[02:47:07.990 --> 02:47:09.371]  I will not let you down.
[02:47:09.471 --> 02:47:12.353]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[02:47:36.499 --> 02:47:40.320]  We're back here live inside the InfoWars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[02:47:40.400 --> 02:47:41.940]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:42.160 --> 02:47:43.701]  Noah Troyer hosting today.
[02:47:43.901 --> 02:47:52.363]  We just had a fantastic Nights of the InfoWars Roundtable, if you will, featuring Harrison Smith, Chase Geyser, Alex popped in, myself.
[02:47:52.603 --> 02:47:54.484]  Alex just filed that special report as well.
[02:47:56.244 --> 02:48:02.946]  As we listen to this epic, dramatic music coming in, I kind of weigh...
[02:48:04.329 --> 02:48:15.035]  The subjects of discussion from one end to the other where we talk about the potential for war and nuclear weapons and space-based weapons and what is that?
[02:48:16.696 --> 02:48:17.957]  It's destruction, it's death.
[02:48:19.758 --> 02:48:29.564]  And then on the other side we talk about the beauty of creation and the megaliths and the pyramids and all this ancient architecture and its beauty.
[02:48:34.454 --> 02:48:37.496]  And it's like, that's the two options that we have now.
[02:48:39.978 --> 02:48:56.150]  In this pivotal time of human existence, human consciousness, as we're about to enter a new age of technology, do we go nukes, space-based weapons, war, destruction?
[02:48:58.031 --> 02:49:02.635]  Or do we go creation, beauty, architecture, humanity, vision,
[02:49:06.385 --> 02:49:08.967]  That's where we're at.
[02:49:09.187 --> 02:49:10.267]  That's the fork in the road.
[02:49:10.307 --> 02:49:11.168]  That's the crossroads.
[02:49:13.729 --> 02:49:18.171]  And it's understanding that that helps us decide and do the right thing.
[02:49:18.211 --> 02:49:25.654]  And it shouldn't be even an American issue or a Russian issue or a Jew issue or a Christian issue.
[02:49:25.674 --> 02:49:28.636]  Do you want life or death?
[02:49:30.797 --> 02:49:33.438]  Do you want creation or destruction?
[02:49:33.518 --> 02:49:35.019]  Do you want beauty or ugliness?
[02:49:37.766 --> 02:49:50.678]  So it's pretty epic to juxtapose those two things.
[02:49:54.081 --> 02:50:02.149]  What is represented by nuclear war and space-based weapons technology versus the pyramids and
[02:50:03.948 --> 02:50:07.189]  Ancient architecture, whether it's in Greece or anywhere else.
[02:50:07.209 --> 02:50:13.850]  It's like, yeah, well, humans can have this, or humans can have this.
[02:50:16.010 --> 02:50:29.553]  And it's our own psychotic leaders, because everybody would choose creation, everybody would choose beauty, but it's our psychotic, demonic leaders that are choosing death and destruction for us all.
[02:50:30.293 --> 02:50:31.813]  Because if they can't have power...
[02:50:33.419 --> 02:50:38.542]  If they can't have totalitarian power and control, then nobody gets it.
[02:50:41.324 --> 02:50:43.886]  It's the complete absence of nobility.
[02:50:43.926 --> 02:50:52.751]  It's the complete absence of a moral consciousness or ethics or love.
[02:50:54.773 --> 02:50:56.153]  It's to lust.
[02:50:56.354 --> 02:50:57.514]  It's to have greed.
[02:50:57.614 --> 02:50:58.615]  It's to have envy.
[02:51:01.117 --> 02:51:01.657]  And it's what
[02:51:03.303 --> 02:51:08.908]  is represented by our current political leadership and establishment.
[02:51:11.570 --> 02:51:14.192]  It's not what humans really want.
[02:51:15.673 --> 02:51:18.576]  It's not what the average person just living their life really wants.
[02:51:18.596 --> 02:51:20.297]  It's not what the listener of this show really wants.
[02:51:22.539 --> 02:51:25.221]  It's the 1% of the 1% that feel that way.
[02:51:28.664 --> 02:51:30.365]  Why do you see American cities...
[02:51:31.328 --> 02:51:34.029]  Going into decay and violence and crime.
[02:51:35.650 --> 02:51:39.172]  Because the people in power genuinely hate you.
[02:51:39.392 --> 02:51:40.692]  They don't like you seeing.
[02:51:41.093 --> 02:51:42.713]  They don't like seeing you wealthy.
[02:51:42.753 --> 02:51:44.314]  They don't like seeing you happy.
[02:51:44.654 --> 02:51:47.316]  They don't like seeing you feeling good about the future.
[02:51:47.356 --> 02:51:48.396]  They want it the opposite.
[02:51:48.436 --> 02:51:49.697]  They want you unhealthy.
[02:51:49.717 --> 02:51:50.597]  They want you fat.
[02:51:51.798 --> 02:51:53.659]  They want you to feel negatively about the future.
[02:51:54.299 --> 02:51:55.880]  That's how they control you.
[02:51:55.900 --> 02:52:00.602]  And it's been going on for so long, it's inevitable the pendulum swings back.
[02:52:01.667 --> 02:52:02.167]  We're good to go.
[02:52:02.207 --> 02:52:02.367]  I think?
[02:52:31.161 --> 02:52:32.102]  And rule over it.
[02:52:33.883 --> 02:52:35.785]  Then allow humanity to thrive and prosper.
[02:52:35.825 --> 02:52:37.867]  Alright, we're waxing a little bit here to close the show.
[02:52:38.247 --> 02:52:39.688]  Drew Hernandez is coming up.
[02:52:41.390 --> 02:52:43.632]  He's going to be hosting the fourth hour today.
[02:52:45.213 --> 02:52:47.895]  And then Harrison Smith is going to be filling in for the war room for me.
[02:52:47.955 --> 02:52:51.738]  I'll be back tomorrow with Alex hosting this transmission.
[02:52:51.778 --> 02:52:53.360]  It's all brought to you by you.
[02:52:54.561 --> 02:52:58.184]  Shopping at InfoWarsStore.com And isn't that the beauty of this transmission too?
[02:53:00.287 --> 02:53:02.268]  We have things that you need.
[02:53:02.288 --> 02:53:03.709]  We have things that you want.
[02:53:21.101 --> 02:53:21.461]  We're good to go.
[02:53:50.031 --> 02:53:50.551]  We're good to go.
[02:54:19.858 --> 02:54:20.518]  We're good to go.
[02:54:20.538 --> 02:54:20.678]  I think?
[02:54:49.124 --> 02:54:58.990]  You put a couple vitamin D3 gummies on the counter every morning for your kids, they're going to think you're the coolest parent ever because you're letting them eat gummies in the morning and they taste great, but really you're just making sure they're getting their vitamin D3.
[02:54:59.071 --> 02:55:05.115]  So you win, you get to be the cool parent, and your kid is getting the vitamin D3 that they need in the winter months.
[02:55:05.795 --> 02:55:09.998]  Both of those 40% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:55:10.218 --> 02:55:14.601]  So all your support there makes everything we do here possible.
[02:55:16.022 --> 02:55:16.442]  All right.
[02:55:17.303 --> 02:55:17.783]  Let me just...
[02:55:19.448 --> 02:55:22.089]  Well, oh boy, there's just so much to get to here.
[02:55:24.910 --> 02:55:28.912]  Let's hear from Donald Trump responding to the case against him.
[02:55:28.932 --> 02:55:32.454]  It's going to be the first criminal case to go to trial in about two months.
[02:55:32.594 --> 02:55:33.934]  It'll happen at the end of March.
[02:55:34.635 --> 02:55:38.296]  Here's Trump responding to that briefly outside the courtroom in clip 18.
[02:55:44.199 --> 02:55:44.499]  No clip?
[02:55:49.372 --> 02:55:49.712]  Alright.
[02:55:50.793 --> 02:55:51.174]  No clip.
[02:55:52.455 --> 02:55:57.599]  Then let's go into the case against Trump with Fannie Willis and Nathan Wade in court today.
[02:55:57.899 --> 02:55:59.880]  Major developments on this situation.
[02:56:00.541 --> 02:56:06.866]  Here's Terrence Bradley talking about how the National Bar Association is getting involved to try to destroy Trump in clip 20.
[02:56:08.287 --> 02:56:10.489]  Refer to what I was told by the bar.
[02:56:11.370 --> 02:56:13.772]  Rule 1.6 of confidentiality applies.
[02:56:14.572 --> 02:56:17.555]  And that I would be asking for an immediate...
[02:56:19.705 --> 02:56:26.628]  Any communications is what the person at the bar told us.
[02:56:28.489 --> 02:56:29.609]  Any communications?
[02:56:31.130 --> 02:56:33.551]  He did not qualify.
[02:56:34.552 --> 02:56:36.133]  Well, Judge, I don't know.
[02:56:36.913 --> 02:56:38.434]  He didn't go into those specifics.
[02:56:39.774 --> 02:56:42.336]  But this is what was told.
[02:56:44.056 --> 02:56:46.958]  I was sitting there with my attorneys.
[02:56:48.325 --> 02:56:50.786]  So, so much is coming out when it comes to the corruption.
[02:56:52.047 --> 02:56:53.467]  But here's what it shows, folks.
[02:56:54.067 --> 02:56:54.988]  And it's always the left.
[02:56:55.268 --> 02:56:55.828]  It's just true.
[02:56:55.868 --> 02:56:56.689]  It's always Democrat.
[02:56:57.189 --> 02:56:57.889]  It's always the left.
[02:56:58.729 --> 02:56:59.910]  They don't care about justice.
[02:56:59.930 --> 02:57:01.751]  They'll destroy justice for their end goal.
[02:57:03.473 --> 02:57:04.613]  They don't care about anything.
[02:57:04.653 --> 02:57:06.674]  Whether they're a lawyer, they're a leftist activist.
[02:57:06.714 --> 02:57:08.874]  Whether they're a teacher, they're a leftist activist.
[02:57:09.114 --> 02:57:11.355]  Whether they're a doctor, they're a leftist activist.
[02:57:11.395 --> 02:57:13.536]  Whether they're a judge, they're a leftist activist.
[02:57:14.076 --> 02:57:15.576]  That's why they mangle your children.
[02:57:15.796 --> 02:57:17.397]  That's why they indoctrinate your children.
[02:57:17.517 --> 02:57:20.877]  And that's why they subvert justice for their political means and ends.
[02:57:22.438 --> 02:57:30.940]  So I mean, everybody now, all these leftists, whatever little thimble of power they might have to try to destroy Donald Trump, they're going to use it.
[02:57:33.433 --> 02:57:37.618]  So Drew Herrera is coming up next, hosting the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:57:38.519 --> 02:57:40.181]  And Alex will be back tomorrow.
[02:57:40.201 --> 02:57:41.303]  I might be here with him.
[02:57:42.004 --> 02:57:44.387]  It's just going to be another exciting time on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:57:47.873 --> 02:57:53.595]  I'm not perfect and I'm under a lot of stress, but if I didn't have the supplements we have and promote, I wouldn't be able to continue to be on air.
[02:57:54.175 --> 02:58:02.318]  And when you go to InfoWorksStore.com, you are funding the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists in an operation that the enemy admits has been the most effective at exposing them.
[02:58:02.498 --> 02:58:04.039]  Because we're fearless and we don't back down.
[02:58:04.459 --> 02:58:05.339]  We got God on our side.
[02:58:05.739 --> 02:58:07.240]  But God needs to work through you.
[02:58:07.600 --> 02:58:11.601]  You've got to make the decision to get great products you already need at InfoWorksStore.com.
[02:58:11.641 --> 02:58:12.882]  And that is a 360 win.
[02:58:13.482 --> 02:58:16.443]  Nitric Boost, without me even knowing, became our number three bestseller.
[02:58:17.143 --> 02:58:18.745]  Because people loved it so much.
[02:58:18.765 --> 02:58:19.706]  They had such great effects.
[02:58:20.006 --> 02:58:26.171]  Got all these natural compounds that clean out the blood, open up your arteries and veins, the capillaries, clean out your heart, your brain, everything.
[02:58:26.972 --> 02:58:28.713]  Well, we got an even better manufacturer.
[02:58:28.733 --> 02:58:33.557]  The other one was great, but one that's even better with even higher quality ingredients at a lower price.
[02:58:34.558 --> 02:58:36.981]  So I could never offer nitric boosters.
[02:58:37.001 --> 02:58:38.462]  It cost us so much to make.
[02:58:39.283 --> 02:58:41.485]  And now we can offer it for 40% off.
[02:58:42.046 --> 02:58:45.829]  Infowarsstore.com, nitric boosts finally back in stock.
[02:58:45.849 --> 02:58:47.451]  40% off out of the gates.
[02:58:47.971 --> 02:58:50.514]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalists.
[02:58:50.874 --> 02:58:53.235]  And people can't identify who's a patron and who isn't.
[02:58:53.555 --> 02:58:56.697]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalist.
[02:58:56.757 --> 02:58:59.658]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.
[02:58:59.918 --> 02:59:10.503]  That's why I designed this amazing 1776 red, white, and blue Gadsden flag shirt so you can support the Infowar and meet like-minded people everywhere when you wear it.
[02:59:10.623 --> 02:59:11.124]  We're good to go.

[02:59:26.970 --> 02:59:32.234]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is antithetical, the complete opposite of what the globalists are pushing.
[02:59:32.495 --> 02:59:40.261]  So get both the Team Humanity and the 1776 Gadsden Snake shirts, limited edition, at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[02:59:40.681 --> 02:59:44.464]  Spread the word, meet like-minded people, and fund the 1776 revolution worldwide.
[02:59:51.300 --> 02:59:55.225]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:07.376 --> 03:00:12.100]  This one on InfoWarriors, you are now watching the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:12.240 --> 03:00:14.902]  I'm your guest host, Drew Hernandez.
[03:00:14.942 --> 03:00:24.368]  I think it's pretty obvious what we're going to continue to see, not just in 2024, but as we go into the new age, as the great Owen Schroyer was just putting it.
[03:00:24.789 --> 03:00:26.070]  That makes perfect sense to me.
[03:00:26.110 --> 03:00:31.774]  As we advanced in technology, as we advanced as a civilization...
[03:00:33.017 --> 03:00:38.199]  Not morally, not spiritually, because obviously on that front we're going backwards.
[03:00:38.359 --> 03:00:39.420]  We're deteriorating.
[03:00:39.600 --> 03:00:44.262]  We have a moral deterioration that the Bible does speak of.
[03:00:44.282 --> 03:00:45.703]  You can take a look at Romans chapter 1.
[03:00:45.763 --> 03:00:47.263]  God lays it all out right there.
[03:00:47.303 --> 03:00:55.847]  So when I talk about an advancement or a progression in society, I'm not talking about being all gay, woke, and everything has to be black.
[03:00:56.884 --> 03:01:21.008]  No, I'm talking about as civilization does continue to technologically advance, so will these psychological operations carried out by the deep state, carried out by these globalist rogue entities and governments and so-called politicians that claim to be actively participating in what they say is a democracy.
[03:01:21.068 --> 03:01:22.868]  We know everything is becoming engineered.
[03:01:23.469 --> 03:01:25.789]  We know everything is becoming a part of an algorithm.
[03:01:27.001 --> 03:01:39.067]  Everything that you are being presented on your smartphone, on your applications, social media, everything's aggregated, everything is calculated, everything is being presented to you via AI.
[03:01:39.127 --> 03:01:48.132]  Not to say that artificial intelligence is an evil thing, but it could be used for evil purposes, and that's with any piece of technology that we've seen throughout human history.
[03:01:49.172 --> 03:01:54.635]  Whether it be the advent of radio, the advent of television, any type of
[03:01:55.265 --> 03:01:55.765]  We're good to go.
[03:02:20.698 --> 03:02:22.559]  I think that's part of the psychological operation.
[03:02:22.579 --> 03:02:23.459]  A lot of, I would say,
[03:02:50.848 --> 03:02:53.910]  You know, older generations kind of have that mindset.
[03:02:53.970 --> 03:02:54.971]  Not all, not all.
[03:02:55.911 --> 03:02:57.312]  But, you know, some of us have parents.
[03:02:57.352 --> 03:02:58.433]  I mean, I can speak for myself.
[03:02:58.493 --> 03:02:59.093]  I have parents.
[03:02:59.153 --> 03:03:13.523]  I have, you know, aunts and uncles that are like, oh, we'll just get the kids to set up my iPhone or get, you know, get one of the young, get one of those young, you know, one of those youngins to come in and help me with my PC or set up my iPad.
[03:03:13.623 --> 03:03:14.403]  I can't figure it out.
[03:03:14.443 --> 03:03:17.225]  Just figure it out for me and I'll push the buttons here or there.
[03:03:17.665 --> 03:03:20.107]  I think that mindset is actually disabling.
[03:03:21.094 --> 03:03:22.075]  To civilization.
[03:03:22.095 --> 03:03:26.219]  I think that mindset is disabling to generations.
[03:03:26.239 --> 03:03:28.441]  And I think that's by design, to be honest with you guys.
[03:03:29.902 --> 03:03:34.186]  I don't think we are meant to be in that psychological trap or prison.
[03:03:35.187 --> 03:03:36.709]  Especially if you're an older generation.
[03:03:36.729 --> 03:03:45.377]  Just because you're older, have you really been convinced that as you age, you can't learn new technologies?
[03:03:45.417 --> 03:03:46.338]  You can't learn...
[03:03:47.739 --> 03:03:48.099]  We're good to go.
[03:03:48.219 --> 03:03:48.660]  I think?
[03:04:00.988 --> 03:04:01.668]  We're good to go.
[03:04:01.688 --> 03:04:02.489]  We're good to go.
[03:04:28.968 --> 03:04:41.851]  The psychological or the technological manipulations of the future from the New World Order, that's what I'm warning against, because I think that's what's happening all around me as I continue to look around and see everything that's going on.
[03:04:42.431 --> 03:04:51.793]  So we will continue this on the other side, because I think this is part of what we're seeing as we go into the new age and go into the new future, and this is what the New World Order will want.
[03:04:52.033 --> 03:04:55.854]  A bunch of NPC zombies that just want them to think for them technology.
[03:04:56.314 --> 03:04:57.234]  Technologically speaking.
[03:04:57.314 --> 03:04:57.714]  We'll be right back.

[03:06:01.622 --> 03:06:03.443]  We're good to go.
[03:06:23.965 --> 03:06:24.906]  We're good to go.
[03:06:52.566 --> 03:06:56.670]  To manipulate the minds of the masses and manipulate the minds of millions of people.
[03:06:58.011 --> 03:07:07.380]  And I would argue right now, I think what's happening to us, what's happening to America, I definitely could speak to right now, is you kind of have this front.
[03:07:07.760 --> 03:07:10.103]  And think with me, especially if you're older.
[03:07:10.523 --> 03:07:12.265]  Don't check out automatically.
[03:07:12.505 --> 03:07:13.366]  That's my point.
[03:07:14.106 --> 03:07:15.348]  Don't check out because...
[03:07:16.423 --> 03:07:22.546]  You think that what's being said is offending your intellect or offending your so-called morality.
[03:07:23.006 --> 03:07:31.489]  I'm advocating that you don't let the New World Order cause you to believe that you're too old and you're too stupid to figure out a new piece of technology.
[03:07:31.669 --> 03:07:38.132]  Because if I'm the New World Order, if I'm Satan, if I'm these demonic legions, that's exactly what I want you to believe.
[03:07:38.152 --> 03:07:44.475]  That's exactly how I want you to function as a citizen of mankind, as a participant in this
[03:07:45.879 --> 03:07:49.380]  Creation that God has given us as human beings, the human species.
[03:07:50.820 --> 03:07:59.882]  If I'm these satanic entities, any type of new piece of technology that comes out, no, no, no, humanity, don't get involved and don't understand that.
[03:08:00.362 --> 03:08:02.342]  Just let the government handle that.
[03:08:03.142 --> 03:08:10.543]  And then we sit here and we wonder why big tech has been hijacked by the satanists and the luciferians and the pedophiles and the globalists.
[03:08:11.664 --> 03:08:13.344]  And then we sit here and we complain that
[03:08:14.176 --> 03:08:15.778]  I would argue it's the latter.
[03:08:34.229 --> 03:08:34.529]  Within seconds.
[03:08:34.569 --> 03:08:35.069]  Within milliseconds.
[03:08:35.109 --> 03:08:35.990]  The gospel message could be
[03:09:03.334 --> 03:09:05.476]  Preached around the entire world within seconds.
[03:09:06.977 --> 03:09:14.162]  And artificial intelligence could be utilized to translate the language to any nation in real time within seconds.
[03:09:14.202 --> 03:09:14.983]  Is that an evil thing?
[03:09:15.003 --> 03:09:15.883]  Is that a bad thing?
[03:09:15.903 --> 03:09:22.268]  No, that's technology being used for a good and a righteous eternal purpose.
[03:09:22.998 --> 03:09:23.218]  I think?
[03:09:48.686 --> 03:09:50.907]  That are like, oh, if it's over a minute, that's too long.
[03:09:50.967 --> 03:09:51.848]  I can't listen to it.
[03:09:52.168 --> 03:09:54.709]  If it's over 30 seconds, that's too long.
[03:09:54.789 --> 03:09:55.790]  I can't listen to it.
[03:09:56.610 --> 03:09:56.930]  Really?
[03:09:57.831 --> 03:10:07.916]  Like, you expect to win an info war based off of little 30 to one minute pieces of intel that's distributed to humanity?
[03:10:08.017 --> 03:10:10.898]  Obviously, you could pack in a lot in a short amount of time.
[03:10:10.938 --> 03:10:11.719]  I'm not knocking that.
[03:10:11.759 --> 03:10:12.419]  I'm just saying...
[03:10:13.191 --> 03:10:22.798]  I think there's something, too, and it's pretty obvious, especially, like I said, with this TikTok age, and you have these generations that are totally hijacked, and they're being trained.
[03:10:22.838 --> 03:10:28.502]  They're psychologically trained to tune out anything that's over 30 seconds to a minute long.
[03:10:28.542 --> 03:10:29.623]  You guys know people like this.
[03:10:30.683 --> 03:10:36.267]  I mean, especially if you're a millennial out there, you know, that are having children and you're watching this.
[03:10:36.487 --> 03:10:37.768]  Just throw the kids an iPad.
[03:10:37.788 --> 03:10:40.050]  Just let them be psychologically tuned out.
[03:10:40.638 --> 03:10:41.898]  You know, become a vegetable.
[03:10:41.938 --> 03:10:43.219]  Sit there and just drool.
[03:10:43.259 --> 03:10:46.540]  Just look at the iPad for hours.
[03:10:46.660 --> 03:10:48.981]  And it calms them down, Drew.
[03:10:49.041 --> 03:10:49.961]  It calms them down.
[03:10:50.001 --> 03:10:51.521]  Yeah, now your kid's a zombie.
[03:10:52.062 --> 03:10:56.423]  And that's totally being taught how to think via a piece of technology.
[03:10:56.443 --> 03:10:57.823]  And what are they looking at?
[03:10:59.564 --> 03:11:01.705]  And especially if you're, you know, Gen X or boomers out there.
[03:11:01.865 --> 03:11:02.725]  You guys know.
[03:11:02.745 --> 03:11:03.465]  You've had kids.
[03:11:03.545 --> 03:11:04.405]  You have grandkids.
[03:11:04.445 --> 03:11:05.826]  Or you have nieces and nephews.
[03:11:07.100 --> 03:11:10.181]  That are millennials or Gen Z or Generation Alpha.
[03:11:10.422 --> 03:11:12.662]  I'm not saying all of us are like this because I'm not like this.
[03:11:14.123 --> 03:11:15.884]  I love long form type of content.
[03:11:16.504 --> 03:11:32.951]  A lot of people complained about Putin's interview because he gave a 600 plus year history lesson on an Eastern-Western Europe conflict pertaining to Russia's, his position, orthodox entitlement to the land.
[03:11:33.567 --> 03:11:34.088]  And that was what?
[03:11:34.128 --> 03:11:37.851]  He spent like 30 minutes to an hour and a half just breaking that down to Tucker.
[03:11:37.931 --> 03:11:38.812]  I love that kind of stuff.
[03:11:38.832 --> 03:11:39.653]  I'll sit there and listen.
[03:11:39.813 --> 03:11:41.054]  That's why I love the Alex Jones Show.
[03:11:41.074 --> 03:11:43.196]  Just sit there and listen for three to four hours.
[03:11:43.216 --> 03:11:44.697]  It's fine with me.
[03:11:44.717 --> 03:11:58.249]  I just think that there's a psychological manipulation going on where don't listen to intelligence that's being broadcast for more than a minute long because you don't have time for that.
[03:11:58.590 --> 03:11:59.811]  Oh, you don't have time for that?
[03:12:00.529 --> 03:12:00.849]  We're good to go.
[03:12:31.658 --> 03:12:40.542]  And these technological, advanced psychological operations that are going to continue as we go forward into this new age, this new generation.
[03:12:40.562 --> 03:12:43.443]  When I say new age, I'm saying new generation.
[03:12:43.483 --> 03:12:46.264]  I'm saying this new world order globalist mindset.
[03:12:46.284 --> 03:12:48.865]  I love how Owen broke that down earlier because it really got me thinking.
[03:12:49.753 --> 03:12:51.715]  It's like new age, new generation.
[03:12:51.775 --> 03:13:00.482]  It's going to accompany an entire new way of culture and life and understanding technological advancements.
[03:13:01.003 --> 03:13:13.333]  If you don't understand AI, you will not even understand how to identify it when it is presented to you, when there's a piece of false information, when there's a piece of real misinformation or disinformation coming from the deep state.
[03:13:15.405 --> 03:13:24.347]  And then you got big tech and then you got big government and then you got the deep state, then you got the rogue federal government in the United States, the WEFC.
[03:13:24.387 --> 03:13:33.829]  This is why you'll hear Klaus Schwab and you'll hear these globalists like Noah Yuval Harari and you hear them talking about technology at the World Government Summit.
[03:13:34.269 --> 03:13:35.009]  They all know this.
[03:13:35.069 --> 03:13:37.210]  They all make themselves very clear.
[03:13:37.990 --> 03:13:38.730]  They want to be what?
[03:13:38.830 --> 03:13:42.491]  Masters of the future by mastering the technologies of today and the future.
[03:13:43.488 --> 03:13:44.493]  And so where does that leave us?
[03:13:44.613 --> 03:13:47.669]  That leaves us, if you're buying into that PSYOP,
[03:13:48.348 --> 03:13:49.588]  Well, I don't want to understand that.
[03:13:49.628 --> 03:13:50.309]  I can't learn it.
[03:13:50.349 --> 03:13:51.009]  I'm too old.
[03:13:51.049 --> 03:13:52.790]  I can't.
[03:13:52.830 --> 03:13:54.050]  That's for the youngins.
[03:13:54.350 --> 03:14:16.958]  Well, the youngins are being hijacked by Lucifer, and the youngins are the ones like Mark Zuckerberg, my generation, and Jack Dorsey's, right, that created these social media apps and that have been used as puppets for this fascist, rogue, futuristic regime to implement a culture of worldwide censorship and destroy the First Amendment in the United States of America.
[03:14:17.498 --> 03:14:18.240]  So what's next?
[03:14:19.702 --> 03:14:21.706]  You don't want to get involved with understanding technology?
[03:14:22.127 --> 03:14:29.159]  That's why there are a lot of senators and there's a lot of congressmen that don't understand anything.
[03:14:29.360 --> 03:14:30.602]  That don't understand anything.
[03:14:31.221 --> 03:14:38.964]  Piece of technology or artificial intelligence or algorithmic abilities and capabilities and what these look like on these platforms.
[03:14:39.404 --> 03:14:45.506]  And then they call in these Senate hearings or they call in these committee hearings and they'll bring in Jack Dorsey.
[03:14:45.526 --> 03:14:47.146]  They'll bring in a Mark Zuckerberg.
[03:14:47.406 --> 03:14:53.589]  And all these guys kind of do is sit there just like – these guys don't know what – they don't understand technology.
[03:14:53.629 --> 03:14:57.810]  We just sit here and say what we have to say and go home, wrap it up, and we're out.
[03:14:58.479 --> 03:14:59.159]  Where does that come from?
[03:15:18.579 --> 03:15:22.744]  Not elected, but they get appointed and installed in serious positions of power.
[03:15:22.784 --> 03:15:29.331]  They're going to manipulate generations to come and generations that already exist that have tapped out and said, well, I'm too old.
[03:15:29.391 --> 03:15:30.332]  I can't figure this out.
[03:15:31.693 --> 03:15:34.096]  No, you're not too old and you can figure this out.
[03:15:34.116 --> 03:15:35.217]  That's a lie from Satan.
[03:15:35.537 --> 03:15:36.739]  I'm not here to offend you.
[03:15:37.865 --> 03:15:39.146]  I'm here to uplift you.
[03:15:39.286 --> 03:15:48.373]  I am here to convince you that there's an agenda out there, especially going after boomers, going after Gen X, going after older generations.
[03:15:48.393 --> 03:15:49.113]  Just tap out.
[03:15:49.374 --> 03:15:50.515]  Don't learn the technology.
[03:15:50.735 --> 03:15:51.976]  Don't understand any of this.
[03:15:52.156 --> 03:15:53.777]  Just get one of the kids to do it for you.
[03:15:53.897 --> 03:15:54.217]  Why?
[03:15:54.518 --> 03:15:54.718]  Why?
[03:15:54.958 --> 03:15:55.879]  Who taught you that?
[03:15:56.119 --> 03:15:59.061]  Who trained you psychologically to be that way?
[03:16:00.182 --> 03:16:01.743]  To not learn anything any further.
[03:16:02.614 --> 03:16:11.300]  To not understand anything that may be more advanced than your generation or the technology of the generations before you.
[03:16:12.080 --> 03:16:14.322]  Who convinced you to think that way?
[03:16:14.542 --> 03:16:16.503]  I'm not saying everybody thinks that way.
[03:16:17.203 --> 03:16:19.165]  I'm just saying I've noticed that in my life.
[03:16:19.365 --> 03:16:31.933]  I've noticed that with people around me and I think that's part of the psychological operation to get humanity to totally check out and just not even want to deal with it and not even try to understand it.
[03:16:33.621 --> 03:16:47.529]  I'm not saying you've got to sit here and understand how to create AI and how to create millions of bots in real time to be able to do your bidding in the stock market and make sure that they're monitoring your social media to vet what's true and what's real and what's not.
[03:16:47.849 --> 03:16:54.673]  You have to understand how to create an AI and you have to have quantum computing in your own house to be able to control these and create.
[03:16:55.133 --> 03:17:01.637]  What I'm saying is at least understand what the technology is, what it looks like, and how to deal with it.
[03:17:03.231 --> 03:17:03.651]  Alex Jones Show!
[03:17:03.671 --> 03:17:04.372]  We're good to go.
[03:17:28.644 --> 03:17:41.232]  Because they're going to start rolling out their technological advancements and their advanced, sophisticated psychological operations through AI and algorithmic manipulation, not only on big tech, but in real time.
[03:17:41.252 --> 03:17:42.753]  They're going to go beyond television.
[03:17:44.634 --> 03:17:53.279]  That's why Noah Yuval Harari and all these globalists are talking about jacking the minds of the public into a VR society, into an augmented reality.
[03:17:54.286 --> 03:17:58.007]  ...into a society where you're living outside of the real reality.
[03:17:58.087 --> 03:18:08.371]  It's a real-life matrix where devices will be utilized to manipulate psychologically to be jacked into it so you're stuck there and you want to live there forever.
[03:18:08.892 --> 03:18:10.712]  They want to take whole economies into this system.
[03:18:12.713 --> 03:18:22.917]  What happens when that gets taken to a whole new level with 200 years of advancement in technology accompanied by satanic, luciferian, demonic...
[03:18:24.063 --> 03:18:24.683]  We're good to go.
[03:18:24.703 --> 03:18:26.324]  We're good to go.
[03:18:26.344 --> 03:18:26.884]  We're good to go.
[03:18:53.228 --> 03:18:53.628]  We're good to go.
[03:18:53.668 --> 03:18:54.249]  We're good to go.
[03:18:54.269 --> 03:18:54.789]  We're good to go.
[03:19:22.748 --> 03:19:25.250]  Where, I don't know, it could be like a position of laziness.
[03:19:25.330 --> 03:19:27.071]  It could be a position of incompetence.
[03:19:27.211 --> 03:19:30.274]  It could be a position of maybe even pride or arrogance.
[03:19:30.294 --> 03:19:31.194]  Well, I know everything.
[03:19:31.454 --> 03:19:31.915]  Oh, do you?
[03:19:32.715 --> 03:19:32.996]  Right.
[03:19:33.196 --> 03:19:35.237]  So you don't have any room to learn anymore, do you?
[03:19:35.257 --> 03:19:37.939]  Yeah, because you're just the smartest person on planet Earth.
[03:19:39.400 --> 03:19:40.321]  You got it all covered.
[03:19:41.342 --> 03:19:42.122]  You know everything.
[03:19:42.382 --> 03:19:43.643]  There's nothing left to learn.
[03:19:43.663 --> 03:19:50.068]  I don't know about you guys, but as I get older, I want to keep learning and I want to keep
[03:19:51.147 --> 03:19:55.290]  Understanding, and I want to grow in wisdom, and I don't think that ever stops, especially as a Christian.
[03:19:55.310 --> 03:20:00.834]  It's like, what, you went to an Ivy League, you went to a Big Four, you got a master's degree, and that's it?
[03:20:00.874 --> 03:20:01.495]  You're done?
[03:20:01.555 --> 03:20:02.636]  You're done learning forever?
[03:20:02.656 --> 03:20:04.337]  No more learning anymore!
[03:20:04.457 --> 03:20:05.958]  Just never pick up a book ever again!
[03:20:05.978 --> 03:20:17.087]  Never sit down and have, you know, maybe an hour to two hour of quiet time just conversating with God, reading the Word, reading the Bible, and praying things out, and
[03:20:19.221 --> 03:20:27.382]  You know, asking God for direction while at the same time taking a look at the world around you and understanding what's, oh, what are these technological advancements?
[03:20:27.422 --> 03:20:30.923]  Maybe I should, and I've dealt with people like this, guys.
[03:20:31.703 --> 03:20:35.564]  Like, I was in ministry as a youth pastor for like six years, five, six years.
[03:20:36.704 --> 03:20:39.885]  And I remember it was, what year was it?
[03:20:39.905 --> 03:20:42.565]  It was the year 2017, somewhere around there, 2018.
[03:20:42.985 --> 03:20:47.406]  And I remember going to the senior pastor of the church.
[03:20:47.466 --> 03:20:47.906]  True story.
[03:20:48.777 --> 03:21:04.224]  I remember going to the senior pastor of the church, and I was really paying attention to the developments of To the Stars and Tom DeLong and Lou Elizondo and all of this development of disclosure of anti-gravitic craft.
[03:21:04.984 --> 03:21:10.807]  We're coming one step closer with the Nimitz and the Tic Tac with Commander...
[03:21:11.477 --> 03:21:16.298]  Dave Fravor and off the coast of San Diego and these UFOs are real.
[03:21:16.638 --> 03:21:17.479]  It's in existence.
[03:21:17.559 --> 03:21:18.639]  It's all in existence.
[03:21:19.079 --> 03:21:24.581]  The UFOs, the aliens now, because now we have very credible sources coming from the federal government.
[03:21:25.141 --> 03:21:27.121]  We have credible sources coming from the Navy.
[03:21:27.361 --> 03:21:32.243]  We have credible sources coming from the military that nobody can deny.
[03:21:32.263 --> 03:21:38.224]  And it's to confirm the fact that there is some kind of extraterrestrial life out there.
[03:21:38.444 --> 03:21:40.105]  The church has to have an answer for that.
[03:21:41.641 --> 03:21:43.421]  And I saw that developing pretty quickly.
[03:21:43.441 --> 03:21:49.203]  I remember I went to the pastor and I said, hey, man, I think we got to be ready.
[03:21:49.443 --> 03:21:51.144]  I think they're getting ready to move here.
[03:21:51.904 --> 03:21:55.365]  I'm not trying to be disrespectful, but I think the church is going to have to have an answer.
[03:21:55.665 --> 03:21:57.205]  What's our theological response?
[03:21:58.565 --> 03:22:00.306]  What's our theological response when...
[03:22:01.627 --> 03:22:02.367]  You got the U.S.
[03:22:02.407 --> 03:22:08.209]  government with credible sources coming out and saying, well, there are these non-biologicals.
[03:22:09.009 --> 03:22:11.610]  It should be these non-human biologicals.
[03:22:11.650 --> 03:22:12.310]  They're out there.
[03:22:12.730 --> 03:22:15.190]  They're swarming around in the sky.
[03:22:15.210 --> 03:22:17.431]  They're interdimensional.
[03:22:18.351 --> 03:22:22.072]  There's something else out there.
[03:22:22.092 --> 03:22:24.073]  I remember telling the pastor and I said, well, what's...
[03:22:25.717 --> 03:22:26.758]  You know, we got to have an answer.
[03:22:26.778 --> 03:22:27.579]  I know the answer.
[03:22:28.299 --> 03:22:35.546]  I have a biblical stance on this, but I think this is something that the culture is really getting ready to dump on the next generation.
[03:22:35.726 --> 03:22:36.186]  And they did.
[03:22:36.207 --> 03:22:38.268]  And they did.
[03:22:38.288 --> 03:22:42.052]  And fast forward real quick, especially last year.
[03:22:43.055 --> 03:22:54.600]  We're the same deep state that tries to tell you that we're a democracy and Joe Biden won the 2020 election by 80 million plus votes and your elections are secured and fortified.
[03:22:54.940 --> 03:22:55.541]  Trust us.
[03:22:55.881 --> 03:23:03.464]  Yeah, that same deep state that's telling you that your elections are fortified and secured in 2020, but they're not in 2016.
[03:23:03.745 --> 03:23:08.467]  Yeah, that same deep state is coming out and telling you, well, we have the U.S.
[03:23:08.487 --> 03:23:10.688]  government is in possession of...
[03:23:12.060 --> 03:23:13.160]  Not human biologicals.
[03:23:13.180 --> 03:23:14.141]  Yeah, we got aliens.
[03:23:14.421 --> 03:23:15.001]  It's all real.
[03:23:15.021 --> 03:23:15.982]  It's all real.
[03:23:16.022 --> 03:23:18.282]  It's definitely not demonic.
[03:23:18.322 --> 03:23:19.723]  There's no satanic tie to it.
[03:23:20.083 --> 03:23:20.683]  It's all real.
[03:23:20.703 --> 03:23:21.864]  You can trust us on this one.
[03:23:22.684 --> 03:23:23.705]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:23:23.745 --> 03:23:24.825]  Okay, give me a break, right?
[03:23:25.085 --> 03:23:32.488]  You're going to believe the deep state when it comes to the existence of aliens, but you're not going to believe the deep state when it comes to, well, your elections are secure.
[03:23:32.828 --> 03:23:34.088]  I don't believe them at all.
[03:23:35.749 --> 03:23:40.531]  But anyways, I remember telling the pastor, I think they're getting ready to roll this out.
[03:23:42.165 --> 03:23:50.792]  And I'm sure if they did, last year, they started rolling out more whistleblowers and they had the congressional hearing on the Hill.
[03:23:51.193 --> 03:23:54.555]  And that's when they had the, you know, I think it was from the Air Force.
[03:23:55.816 --> 03:23:56.757]  It was Chris Grosh.
[03:23:57.398 --> 03:23:58.078]  I forgot his name.
[03:23:58.098 --> 03:24:02.362]  He came out and said, oh, yeah, we have these non-human biologicals.
[03:24:02.622 --> 03:24:03.303]  I'm like, wait, what?
[03:24:03.943 --> 03:24:05.545]  And everyone's like, oh, aliens exist!
[03:24:05.825 --> 03:24:08.167]  The government told us aliens exist!
[03:24:09.890 --> 03:24:14.574]  Blink-182 from Tom DeLonge to the stars started printing out t-shirts that said, Tom was right!
[03:24:15.054 --> 03:24:16.315]  Aliens effing exist!
[03:24:16.355 --> 03:24:16.915]  Like, oh, why?
[03:24:16.995 --> 03:24:18.637]  Because the government told me so?
[03:24:19.017 --> 03:24:19.497]  Oh, great.
[03:24:19.757 --> 03:24:20.098]  Okay.
[03:24:20.438 --> 03:24:21.038]  Okay, yeah.
[03:24:23.420 --> 03:24:24.001]  And they did it.
[03:24:24.021 --> 03:24:25.101]  They rolled it out, and there it is.
[03:24:25.142 --> 03:24:27.283]  And they're going to continue to push that Project Bluebeam.
[03:24:27.303 --> 03:24:28.504]  You really look into this stuff, man.
[03:24:29.385 --> 03:24:31.386]  They will launch that false flag someday.
[03:24:31.586 --> 03:24:38.852]  Some extraterrestrial threat will be presented by the government.
[03:24:40.225 --> 03:24:42.326]  ...to be dealt with, and it'll unify all of humanity.
[03:24:42.546 --> 03:24:45.687]  Even Ronald Reagan said this to the UN.
[03:24:45.767 --> 03:24:46.687]  You guys remember that?
[03:24:47.448 --> 03:24:48.028]  Years ago?
[03:24:48.428 --> 03:24:49.008]  Was it the UN?
[03:24:49.348 --> 03:24:49.909]  I think years ago.
[03:24:49.929 --> 03:25:02.673]  And Ronald Reagan just came out and told everyone, wouldn't it be interesting that some kind of extraterrestrial, outside, off-world threat just happened to present itself to humanity?
[03:25:03.013 --> 03:25:05.174]  Then maybe we would be unified as one.
[03:25:05.214 --> 03:25:06.655]  It's like, oh, okay, wow.
[03:25:06.675 --> 03:25:07.535]  You might as well just tell us!
[03:25:09.542 --> 03:25:19.704]  But I remember talking to this pastor and said, I think we have to have a solid theological stance on this issue.
[03:25:19.724 --> 03:25:27.026]  And at least as watchmen and shepherds, just warn the flock about this.
[03:25:27.046 --> 03:25:29.026]  This is something you need to be on the lookout for.
[03:25:29.246 --> 03:25:32.187]  It's going to probably challenge your own faith.
[03:25:32.347 --> 03:25:34.467]  It's probably going to challenge the faith of your children.
[03:25:35.383 --> 03:25:37.604]  There are some theological implications to this.
[03:25:38.644 --> 03:25:39.405]  Let's address it.
[03:25:39.445 --> 03:25:40.585]  Let's get ahead of this.
[03:25:41.925 --> 03:25:45.827]  So when it happens, the church is grounded.
[03:25:46.707 --> 03:25:47.787]  And you know the answer I got?
[03:25:47.807 --> 03:25:48.768]  You know the answer I got?
[03:25:49.328 --> 03:25:51.749]  The answer I got was, well, that's just a bunch of nonsense.
[03:25:51.769 --> 03:25:52.489]  We don't need to do that.
[03:25:52.789 --> 03:25:53.009]  Nah.
[03:25:54.210 --> 03:25:58.211]  This is a senior pastor, right, of a Calvary Chapel affiliate.
[03:25:59.485 --> 03:26:00.947]  And I'm just like, what do you mean?
[03:26:01.768 --> 03:26:02.929]  It's a bunch of nonsense.
[03:26:03.509 --> 03:26:12.558]  You may think it's nonsense, but this is going to bring levels of deception tied with so-called technology that they claim is magic.
[03:26:14.460 --> 03:26:19.284]  Like the Bible talks about that in the last days there are going to be satanic lying wonders.
[03:26:19.364 --> 03:26:21.046]  You know what that means in the New Testament?
[03:26:22.102 --> 03:26:22.622]  We're good to go.
[03:26:38.078 --> 03:26:42.820]  How will you know whether it's satanic or whether it's coming from God or not?
[03:26:43.180 --> 03:26:43.920]  Just surface level.
[03:26:44.160 --> 03:26:45.741]  You see a miracle right before your eyes.
[03:26:45.941 --> 03:26:47.261]  How do you know where it's coming from?
[03:26:47.821 --> 03:26:59.505]  Or a technological miracle looks like magic right before your eyes that defies the laws of physics and gravity and everything we know about science, propulsion and aerodynamics just right in front of you.
[03:27:01.026 --> 03:27:01.666]  You witness it.
[03:27:02.466 --> 03:27:03.087]  You watch it.
[03:27:04.087 --> 03:27:05.307]  Your eyes aren't lying to you.
[03:27:06.048 --> 03:27:06.768]  Is that of God?
[03:27:07.842 --> 03:27:08.603]  Is that Satan?
[03:27:09.163 --> 03:27:10.064]  What am I dealing with?
[03:27:10.164 --> 03:27:11.024]  Oh, what a good question.
[03:27:11.705 --> 03:27:14.887]  Because the Bible forewarns that's what you're going to be dealing with in the last days.
[03:27:15.828 --> 03:27:17.429]  And don't think for one second.
[03:27:17.910 --> 03:27:20.352]  See, this is why I'm making this point because it's a level of arrogance.
[03:27:20.392 --> 03:27:23.074]  That pastor I had a conversation with, that was arrogance.
[03:27:23.654 --> 03:27:25.275]  The response I got there was arrogance.
[03:27:25.315 --> 03:27:26.436]  Oh, that's just a bunch of nonsense.
[03:27:26.656 --> 03:27:27.497]  We don't need to do that.
[03:27:28.883 --> 03:27:30.584]  Oh, no, we don't need to waste our time with that.
[03:27:30.604 --> 03:27:36.405]  And then a couple years later, they all roll it out, and all the culture, even some people in the church are like, oh, aliens are all in existence!
[03:27:36.666 --> 03:27:37.586]  We don't know what it is!
[03:27:37.626 --> 03:27:38.406]  What's going on?
[03:27:38.426 --> 03:27:39.746]  The Bible's never addressed this!
[03:27:40.327 --> 03:27:42.727]  Well, read Ephesians chapter 6, and it'll break it down for you.
[03:27:43.568 --> 03:27:44.848]  But people need to understand this.
[03:27:44.868 --> 03:27:48.869]  Because when that pastor told me that, I just, you know, I knew.
[03:27:48.889 --> 03:27:50.070]  I was like, no, this guy's not ready.
[03:27:50.110 --> 03:27:50.630]  He's not ready.
[03:27:51.410 --> 03:27:52.511]  He's not ready for the future.
[03:27:52.531 --> 03:27:53.751]  He's not equipped for the future.
[03:27:54.562 --> 03:28:06.445]  Because the future is going to be accompanied with technological, very sophisticated levels of deception that the church is going to have to deal with, whether you like it or not.
[03:28:07.205 --> 03:28:12.067]  And if you don't even attempt to understand these things, well, then you're already deceived.
[03:28:13.047 --> 03:28:16.788]  I can last two seconds in the future as a born-again Christian.
[03:28:17.634 --> 03:28:40.295]  Because when this deep state, rogue, federal, satanic, Luciferian government starts rolling out all these sophisticated levels of deception and psyops, from False Flag Project Blue Beam, extraterrestrial threats to Russians about to launch dukes from space, just wait until they launch the AI, deepfake, advanced...
[03:28:41.116 --> 03:28:48.344]  Psyops and false flags and then all I'm saying is don't be arrogant to sit there and think, well, I don't need to know about that.
[03:28:48.424 --> 03:28:49.385]  I don't need to learn about that.
[03:28:49.425 --> 03:28:52.748]  All right, well, you've already lost and you're already deceived.
[03:28:53.409 --> 03:28:53.989]  We'll be right back.
[03:28:54.029 --> 03:28:54.470]  We have a lot more.
[03:28:57.485 --> 03:29:01.767]  29 years on air, all I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalists.
[03:29:02.467 --> 03:29:07.809]  And I've done the best job I can to tell the truth and be accurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[03:29:08.189 --> 03:29:14.632]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves, unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people.
[03:29:14.872 --> 03:29:15.552]  We don't do that.
[03:29:16.012 --> 03:29:17.893]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[03:29:18.273 --> 03:29:20.294]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product.
[03:29:20.334 --> 03:29:20.914]  It's so powerful.
[03:29:21.834 --> 03:29:31.900]  This is the breakdown product after your cells process it of folic acid, methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[03:29:32.360 --> 03:29:33.581]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[03:29:33.621 --> 03:29:34.482]  It's not a stimulant.
[03:29:34.742 --> 03:29:36.623]  It energizes your cells.
[03:29:37.123 --> 03:29:41.966]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the globalist agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[03:30:05.151 --> 03:30:18.124]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections, masquerading as vaccines.
[03:30:18.265 --> 03:30:23.250]  It is so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives oblivious.
[03:30:24.571 --> 03:30:27.314]  And you realize ignorance is not bliss, it equals death.
[03:30:29.378 --> 03:30:49.368]  People are starting to really understand how serious things are, and that's a hard thing to do, because to wake up to a disturbing reality and realize that we're in the middle of a giant biological weapons war against humanity, and that there's mass sterilization that's already taking place, cutting off all the major energy sources, is really hard to deal with, but it's the reality.
[03:30:49.908 --> 03:30:51.989]  Facing it is our only chance to turn this around.
[03:30:52.409 --> 03:30:54.090]  This stuff's about to get really, really nasty.

[03:32:00.715 --> 03:32:06.896]  A story about inflammation, the silent menace that lurks within our bodies, affecting our health and well-being.
[03:32:08.036 --> 03:32:13.818]  Inflammation, the root cause of countless ailments, quietly wreaking havoc over time.
[03:32:14.910 --> 03:32:22.600]  Long-term exposure to inflammation has been linked to a myriad of health issues, from heart disease to arthritis, even cognitive decline.
[03:32:23.601 --> 03:32:31.191]  But fear not, for there's a beacon of hope found in the wisdom of nature, a remedy that has stood the test of time, turmeric.

[03:33:09.115 --> 03:33:13.379]  Alright guys, we are back.
[03:33:14.199 --> 03:33:18.002]  Shout out to everyone watching on X. Make sure to share the broadcast.

[03:33:25.771 --> 03:33:27.532]  That's rumble.com slash Drew Hernandez.
[03:33:27.592 --> 03:33:29.553]  I have my own show Monday through Friday.
[03:33:29.633 --> 03:33:30.353]  Go live 8 p.m.
[03:33:30.373 --> 03:33:31.233]  Pacific, 11 p.m.
[03:33:31.273 --> 03:33:32.214]  Eastern Standard Time.
[03:33:33.454 --> 03:33:35.855]  But I want to show you guys something, all right?
[03:33:36.796 --> 03:33:47.401]  There's this article that's been floating around on X this morning, especially with the release of the Apple Vision Pro goggles, this new VR reality.
[03:33:48.041 --> 03:33:49.201]  This is the New York Post.
[03:33:49.241 --> 03:33:50.602]  I'm pretty sure the crew could find it.
[03:33:51.660 --> 03:34:00.062]  Apple Vision Pro users return $3,500 in cost of their headsets.
[03:34:00.702 --> 03:34:09.004]  They say they cause extreme headaches, motion sickness, and a quote from one of the users is it's like a torture session.
[03:34:09.864 --> 03:34:12.824]  You see, what's interesting is this is how they get the public used to this kind of stuff.
[03:34:13.885 --> 03:34:20.226]  And speaking of technological advancements, as they want you jacked into a VR reality in the future...
[03:34:20.993 --> 03:34:33.402]  I mean, you have Apple rolling out their Apple Vision Pros and thousands of people are returning them because they're discovering just how much of a torture this is psychologically for the individual.
[03:34:33.422 --> 03:34:35.684]  And all they're doing is using...
[03:34:36.977 --> 03:34:40.258]  A software interface that is similar to your iPhone.
[03:34:40.278 --> 03:34:41.199]  You have your homepage.
[03:34:41.219 --> 03:34:42.259]  You could look at Safari.
[03:34:42.299 --> 03:34:52.983]  You could probably watch a video and have that spatial experience with your VR goggles on as you walk around and you could do the hand movements.
[03:34:53.783 --> 03:34:55.604]  But that has an impact on the brain.
[03:34:55.644 --> 03:34:59.305]  That has an impact psychologically on the user and the individual.
[03:34:59.906 --> 03:35:03.127]  Now what happens when this piece of technology can't be returned?
[03:35:04.252 --> 03:35:04.752]  We're good to go.
[03:35:30.034 --> 03:35:30.534]  We're good to go.
[03:35:30.554 --> 03:35:31.014]  We're good to go.
[03:35:55.666 --> 03:35:59.648]  And without it, they wouldn't be able to.
[03:35:59.948 --> 03:36:00.869]  There's an argument there.
[03:36:00.949 --> 03:36:05.451]  Pieces of technology can be used for good, like I said, like I started this broadcast.
[03:36:05.751 --> 03:36:08.553]  However, how far does that really go?
[03:36:09.693 --> 03:36:20.699]  And when it becomes a matter of choice and when it becomes a matter of, well, do I get a choice as to whether or not to use this piece of technology or not, that's when it becomes a problem.
[03:36:21.593 --> 03:36:27.815]  And you see there are maybe naive individuals out there that might say to themselves, well, I'll always be given the choice.
[03:36:28.855 --> 03:36:31.896]  You'll always have a choice because you have been given free will by God.
[03:36:32.796 --> 03:36:36.897]  But you're never going to have an easy path to making that choice.
[03:36:37.077 --> 03:36:44.919]  And I think we're all experiencing that now, especially in 2024, where, again, there are more exposés coming out that it's confirmed, yes.
[03:36:46.184 --> 03:36:52.249]  Spygate, the Obama campaign, did indeed spy on Trump, his allies, even before he decided to run in 2016.
[03:36:52.929 --> 03:37:06.079]  Now we do know that the feds forewarned and preemptively warned Twitter 1.0 that the Hunter Biden laptop story was about to come out and it's misinformation and disinformation.
[03:37:06.320 --> 03:37:09.282]  Right before the election, shut it down, shut it down, shut it down.
[03:37:11.388 --> 03:37:13.129]  We know that technology gets manipulated.
[03:37:13.169 --> 03:37:16.990]  We know that big tech has been harnessed and has been weaponized against mankind.
[03:37:17.630 --> 03:37:20.891]  Do you really have a choice on Facebook to say what you want?
[03:37:22.972 --> 03:37:25.533]  Do you really have a choice on X to say what you want?
[03:37:27.554 --> 03:37:28.314]  Oh, yes.
[03:37:28.354 --> 03:37:30.495]  You have freedom of speech, but you don't have freedom of reach.
[03:37:30.895 --> 03:37:31.955]  Whatever the hell that means.
[03:37:32.576 --> 03:37:33.276]  I'm not a fan of that.
[03:37:34.815 --> 03:37:43.277]  I just think billionaires taking it upon themselves to redefine and reinterpret the First Amendment of the United States is insane to me.
[03:37:43.537 --> 03:37:44.597]  Sorry, okay?
[03:37:44.837 --> 03:37:45.437]  Not sorry.
[03:37:46.917 --> 03:37:56.399]  And a lot of people on X are still experiencing some massive levels of throttling and de-boosting, one would call shadow banning.
[03:37:57.799 --> 03:37:59.839]  So do I really have the freedom to say what I want?
[03:37:59.879 --> 03:38:00.800]  I can speak for myself.
[03:38:00.860 --> 03:38:03.100]  My X account is totally, totally throttled.
[03:38:04.008 --> 03:38:04.708]  Totally throttled.
[03:38:05.989 --> 03:38:07.730]  Do I really have the freedom to say what I want?
[03:38:07.770 --> 03:38:08.610]  Especially on X?
[03:38:08.990 --> 03:38:10.391]  On Facebook or Big Tech?
[03:38:11.151 --> 03:38:12.852]  These are all byproducts of what?
[03:38:13.732 --> 03:38:16.374]  An advent of a new technology.
[03:38:16.634 --> 03:38:30.120]  A progression of technological advancements that have been presented to us via smartphone, via algorithm, via software CPU advancements.
[03:38:31.368 --> 03:38:32.549]  That have been compacted.
[03:38:33.249 --> 03:38:36.330]  Look at the computers of the 80s compared to the computers now.
[03:38:36.870 --> 03:38:44.073]  And now the future, they will be in your brain smaller than your pinky nail, okay?
[03:38:45.274 --> 03:38:58.859]  And the point is this, is if we're not even going to have conversations about what these technologies look like and the regulations on these technologies will be in the future, well then we shouldn't complain, right?
[03:38:59.571 --> 03:39:01.614]  Okay, if one, you don't even want to understand them.
[03:39:01.674 --> 03:39:06.279]  If you're part of that generation or that TikTok generation, well, 30 seconds, one minute, I'm out.
[03:39:06.299 --> 03:39:06.960]  That's too long.
[03:39:07.240 --> 03:39:08.061]  I can't handle this.
[03:39:08.942 --> 03:39:09.703]  I can't handle this.
[03:39:09.743 --> 03:39:10.424]  I'm going to check out.
[03:39:10.444 --> 03:39:10.924]  I'm just going to go.
[03:39:10.944 --> 03:39:13.787]  I'm going to go watch some pornography.
[03:39:13.827 --> 03:39:14.588]  That's what I'm going to do.
[03:39:14.809 --> 03:39:16.530]  Yeah, I can't handle doing this.
[03:39:16.551 --> 03:39:16.571]  I
[03:39:18.772 --> 03:39:20.073]  I'm a five-second man.
[03:39:20.333 --> 03:39:25.336]  I'm just going to turn on some Pornhub and jerk it for a little bit.
[03:39:26.777 --> 03:39:28.919]  Just blow a load off in five seconds.
[03:39:29.239 --> 03:39:30.380]  Is that your generation?
[03:39:31.200 --> 03:39:32.161]  Yeah, that's your generation.
[03:39:32.321 --> 03:39:35.603]  You don't want to engage intellectually with ideas.
[03:39:35.643 --> 03:39:37.504]  You don't want to engage the New World Order.
[03:39:38.465 --> 03:39:43.008]  You can't spend more than five seconds really downloading intel.
[03:39:44.065 --> 03:39:46.086]  Yeah, what about that psychological operation?
[03:39:46.106 --> 03:39:50.689]  You got a bunch of masturbators and pornographers out there that are, you know, this is crazy.
[03:39:50.709 --> 03:39:51.969]  It's like, I can't listen.
[03:39:51.989 --> 03:40:02.455]  I can't listen to someone talk about, you know, technological advancements and making sure we understand the technologies of the future so we could prevent a takeover that's more than 30 minutes.
[03:40:02.795 --> 03:40:04.236]  But I can, you know what I need?
[03:40:04.816 --> 03:40:08.358]  I need to go watch like a, you know, a porno show.
[03:40:09.389 --> 03:40:09.869]  You know?
[03:40:10.490 --> 03:40:12.031]  And blow a load in five seconds.
[03:40:12.431 --> 03:40:13.252]  That's what I want!
[03:40:13.472 --> 03:40:14.212]  Like, alright, dude.
[03:40:14.873 --> 03:40:16.874]  You're definitely not being hijacked by the New World Order.
[03:40:17.094 --> 03:40:19.856]  Your mind is definitely not being hijacked by Satan.
[03:40:19.876 --> 03:40:21.477]  It's crazy, isn't it?
[03:40:21.497 --> 03:40:25.840]  It's crazy to think that that's where people are psychologically.
[03:40:26.981 --> 03:40:27.781]  Blows my mind.
[03:40:28.161 --> 03:40:29.522]  But it's the nature of sin, correct?
[03:40:29.823 --> 03:40:34.846]  See, but this is what I'm saying, is people need to understand, like, what really is being done to you via technology?
[03:40:35.692 --> 03:40:44.596]  And what does the future look like with these future technologies as these begin to develop, as Owen Troyer said in the last hour, this new age that we're all going into?
[03:40:45.596 --> 03:40:53.539]  This new generation of technology and people that understand it and people that do understand it, people that don't want to understand it, so they get manipulated.
[03:40:53.959 --> 03:40:54.720]  They tap out.
[03:40:54.760 --> 03:40:55.740]  It's too much for them.
[03:40:55.800 --> 03:40:58.821]  And then you see, this is why you can't complain.
[03:40:59.081 --> 03:41:00.362]  Don't sit there and complain.
[03:41:01.958 --> 03:41:13.265]  That this entire generation is hijacking the future and they're doing it through technology when you never even stopped to try to even understand how any of this stuff works.
[03:41:16.127 --> 03:41:23.011]  That might offend people, but I don't really care because that's the future of what we're all dealing with right now.
[03:41:24.164 --> 03:41:27.626]  Okay, this is not what's going to happen in 10 years, in 5 years, or 20 years.
[03:41:28.306 --> 03:41:32.168]  These things are being developed now for the next 100 years.
[03:41:33.408 --> 03:41:45.394]  And technology that's already been developed 20 years ago, that's now being rolled out to the general public and being manipulated and weaponized against mankind today, now we're all starting to face these things.
[03:41:45.954 --> 03:41:47.195]  So what does the future look like?
[03:41:49.296 --> 03:41:51.677]  Because people may think they have a choice, but do you really have a choice?
[03:41:52.157 --> 03:41:53.358]  Can I really say what I want to say?
[03:41:55.106 --> 03:41:55.506]  We're good to go.
[03:41:55.526 --> 03:41:56.106]  We're good to go.
[03:42:23.143 --> 03:42:26.826]  People always say, especially here on Infowars, the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:42:28.667 --> 03:42:30.309]  What does 1984 even look like?
[03:42:30.689 --> 03:42:36.834]  And do we even understand the technologies to be able to even push back on a 1984 in the year 2050?
[03:42:36.874 --> 03:42:45.120]  Do we even have the intellectual capability to push back and even understand what a 1984 even looks like in the year 2090?
[03:42:47.248 --> 03:42:47.969]  Serious questions.
[03:42:48.409 --> 03:42:53.192]  And if you tap out intellectually, I would argue you probably wouldn't even be able to identify it.
[03:42:53.252 --> 03:42:54.714]  It's staring you right in the face.
[03:42:54.734 --> 03:42:55.394]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:56.695 --> 03:42:58.556]  But folks, we're standing up for our rights.
[03:42:58.596 --> 03:42:59.657]  We're standing up for your rights.
[03:42:59.697 --> 03:43:02.099]  We're standing up for all of our freedoms and our children.
[03:43:02.299 --> 03:43:09.965]  If you don't spread the word about the broadcast, if you don't share the links, if you don't buy products at InfoWarsStore.com, then I'm not griping at you.
[03:43:09.985 --> 03:43:11.065]  I'm just saying, what are you doing?
[03:43:12.166 --> 03:43:15.429]  Less than 1% of you ever buy a product at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:43:16.354 --> 03:43:23.339]  If just a half a percent more would go buy a book or a film or a t-shirt or get some of our great supplements and then reorder them because they really work.
[03:43:23.659 --> 03:43:24.219]  Just try it.
[03:43:24.860 --> 03:43:26.801]  We would be able to do so many things.
[03:43:27.161 --> 03:43:30.924]  I'm praying to God that he'll touch your heart to decide to support us.
[03:43:31.464 --> 03:43:33.205]  Infowarsstore.com
[03:43:35.350 --> 03:43:36.010]  It's been sold out.
[03:43:36.050 --> 03:43:36.831]  It's back in stock.
[03:43:36.911 --> 03:43:38.091]  Reformulated even stronger.
[03:43:38.891 --> 03:43:40.752]  Nitric boost to clean out your blood and your whole body.
[03:43:41.212 --> 03:43:42.293]  Vasodilation.
[03:43:42.313 --> 03:43:44.694]  It's got a lot of wonderful side effects.
[03:43:44.714 --> 03:43:45.234]  And I mean good ones.
[03:43:45.294 --> 03:43:46.554]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[03:43:47.195 --> 03:43:48.075]  It is powerful.
[03:43:48.115 --> 03:43:49.055]  So be careful with it.
[03:43:49.395 --> 03:43:50.536]  Next level foundational energy.
[03:43:50.656 --> 03:43:53.317]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:43:56.658 --> 03:43:57.919]  Bodies is back.
[03:43:58.059 --> 03:44:05.105]  The ultimate turmeric product on the market has returned to InfoWarsStore.com and is now 25% off for a limited time.
[03:44:05.465 --> 03:44:10.469]  Utilized for thousands of years, turmeric is one of the most studied medicinal herbs today.
[03:44:10.849 --> 03:44:18.495]  Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles are published every year on the chemistry and therapeutic potential of turmeric and its active components.
[03:44:18.795 --> 03:44:22.838]  But our super powerful extract used in bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients in turmeric.
[03:44:41.813 --> 03:44:42.554]  We're good to go.
[03:44:56.443 --> 03:45:02.168]  I'm not perfect and I'm under a lot of stress, but if I didn't have the supplements we have, we promote, I wouldn't be able to continue to be on air.
[03:45:02.748 --> 03:45:10.894]  And when you go to InfoWarsStore.com, you are funding the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists in an operation that the enemy admits has been the most effective at exposing them.
[03:45:11.094 --> 03:45:12.696]  Because we're fearless and we don't back down.
[03:45:13.056 --> 03:45:14.077]  We got God on our side.
[03:45:14.317 --> 03:45:15.838]  But God needs to work through you.
[03:45:16.178 --> 03:45:21.482]  You've got to make the decision to get great products you already need at InfoWarsStore.com and that is a 360 win.
[03:45:22.063 --> 03:45:26.086]  Nitric Boost, without even knowing, became our number three best seller because
[03:45:26.286 --> 03:45:27.327]  People loved it so much.
[03:45:27.347 --> 03:45:28.268]  They had such great effects.
[03:45:28.568 --> 03:45:34.733]  Got all these natural compounds that clean out the blood, open up your arteries and veins, encapsulators, clean out your heart, your brain, everything.
[03:45:35.553 --> 03:45:37.295]  Well, we got an even better manufacturer.
[03:45:37.315 --> 03:45:42.139]  The other one was great, but one that's even better with even higher quality ingredients at a lower price.
[03:45:43.137 --> 03:45:47.040]  So I could never offer nitric boosts because it cost us so much to make.
[03:45:47.840 --> 03:45:50.122]  And now we can offer it for 40% off.
[03:45:50.622 --> 03:45:54.405]  Infoworkstore.com nitric boosts finally back in stock.
[03:45:54.425 --> 03:45:56.026]  40% off out of the gates.
[03:45:56.746 --> 03:45:57.547]  Winter is coming.
[03:45:58.207 --> 03:45:58.948]  Winter is coming.
[03:45:59.168 --> 03:46:00.249]  Winter is coming.
[03:46:00.629 --> 03:46:01.410]  Winter is coming.
[03:46:01.710 --> 03:46:02.791]  Winter is coming!
[03:46:03.829 --> 03:46:05.330]  Winter is coming.
[03:46:05.630 --> 03:46:07.032]  Winter isn't coming.
[03:46:07.612 --> 03:46:08.893]  Winter is here.
[03:46:09.313 --> 03:46:16.819]  And while the sun isn't helping us produce as much vitamin D, do yourself a favor and try InfoWars Life Winter Sun Plus.

[03:47:15.277 --> 03:47:16.798]  I am your guest host, Drew Hernandez.

[03:47:27.484 --> 03:47:30.145]  I'm the only verified Drew Hernandez on there.
[03:47:30.185 --> 03:47:32.446]  So we go live Monday through Friday, 8 p.m.
[03:47:32.467 --> 03:47:33.367]  Pacific, 11 p.m.
[03:47:33.407 --> 03:47:34.368]  Eastern Standard Time.
[03:47:35.228 --> 03:47:37.689]  And I want to thank you guys for tuning in today.
[03:47:37.769 --> 03:47:40.311]  Also, make sure to check out theinfowarsstore.com website.
[03:47:41.381 --> 03:47:47.503]  Right now, because there are sales going on, and without your support, the InfoWar will not continue.
[03:47:47.983 --> 03:47:50.364]  And it's up to you guys to keep InfoWars alive.
[03:47:50.424 --> 03:47:53.785]  There are various sales at InfoWarsStore.com going on right now.
[03:47:53.805 --> 03:48:00.628]  40% off Winter Sun+, 40% off Nitric Boost, 40% off Turbo Force+.

[03:48:09.360 --> 03:48:12.541]  Because without doing so, that's how we get destroyed.
[03:48:12.561 --> 03:48:16.903]  Especially by the corporate mainstream fake news media machine.
[03:48:17.703 --> 03:48:20.744]  Because they're being funded by all of these globalist machines.
[03:48:20.904 --> 03:48:23.105]  And we are supported by you, the people.
[03:48:23.645 --> 03:48:24.646]  And we're in God's hands.
[03:48:24.686 --> 03:48:27.987]  So we thank you guys for supporting us on a daily basis.
[03:48:28.347 --> 03:48:33.349]  With that said, guys, let me make this point as well.
[03:48:34.409 --> 03:48:48.938]  Because as you look at the levels of desperation from the deep state and you look at these levels of desperation coming from these globalist regimes, whether it's in the United States or whether it's in Europe or Australia, Canada, it doesn't matter.
[03:48:48.978 --> 03:49:00.625]  When these people begin to lose their grip, when they begin to lose their grip on power via their paranoia, their greatest fear is losing control.
[03:49:01.906 --> 03:49:15.789]  And so when you understand the mind of these Satanists and these globalists and these Luciferians, when you understand the way that they think, then you begin to kind of discern when they make their moves and why they make their moves.
[03:49:16.810 --> 03:49:18.630]  And look at where we are right now in this election year.
[03:49:18.650 --> 03:49:20.570]  Look how quickly things have escalated.
[03:49:21.671 --> 03:49:21.991]  Fast.
[03:49:22.011 --> 03:49:23.251]  We're only, what, two months in to 2024?
[03:49:23.411 --> 03:49:31.253]  And it's like, there are already shootings going on at the Kansas City Super Bowl parade and celebration.
[03:49:32.293 --> 03:49:35.934]  And the media's dropping that story because they won't confirm that it was black people.
[03:49:36.574 --> 03:49:36.974]  Of course.
[03:49:38.594 --> 03:49:44.536]  We've already seen another homosexual show up and shoot up a church in Lakewood.
[03:49:45.036 --> 03:49:45.936]  We've already seen that.
[03:49:47.557 --> 03:49:50.057]  And these operations are already continuing.
[03:49:50.077 --> 03:49:58.139]  We've already seen a lot of movement from the deep state attempting to make Biden look like he's something that he's not.
[03:49:58.965 --> 03:49:59.346]  We're good to go.
[03:50:14.922 --> 03:50:17.344]  And that may be Kamala Harris.
[03:50:18.104 --> 03:50:23.148]  I know Roger Stone firmly believes that it'll be Michael Obama, and I kind of agree with him.
[03:50:23.668 --> 03:50:25.069]  Or it could even be a Gavin Newsom.
[03:50:25.109 --> 03:50:37.937]  Whoever it is, it's going to have to be someone younger, more controllable, and literally in the palm of China, the deep state, and every other nation that is against American interests.
[03:50:38.880 --> 03:50:39.320]  We're good to go.
[03:50:39.340 --> 03:50:39.480]  I think?
[03:51:02.105 --> 03:51:05.648]  And we've seen Biden exposed for having classified documents.
[03:51:06.128 --> 03:51:14.915]  That was so crazy the night of the Putin interview where Biden went up there when the report came out that he had his classified documents in his garage in his house.
[03:51:16.276 --> 03:51:17.517]  He's like, oh, it wasn't as bad.
[03:51:17.537 --> 03:51:23.761]  I just had, you know, my staff had them in my garage and they haven't been filing cabinets that were locked.
[03:51:23.781 --> 03:51:25.723]  It's not like it was Mar-a-Lago or something.
[03:51:26.924 --> 03:51:30.306]  But the double standard there and the hypocrisy is, oh, well, Trump does it.
[03:51:30.346 --> 03:51:30.827]  It's bad.
[03:51:32.287 --> 03:51:33.707]  But when Biden does it, it's good.
[03:51:33.927 --> 03:51:34.427]  It's okay.
[03:51:34.467 --> 03:51:35.288]  It's not that bad.
[03:51:36.388 --> 03:51:38.528]  But they'll probably use that to throw him overboard as well.
[03:51:39.748 --> 03:51:53.211]  The point is we're getting into not just an election year, but we're also getting into, obviously we're in an election year, but we're getting into the phase where the replacement migration agenda is fully operational.
[03:51:53.251 --> 03:51:56.172]  They're replacing Americans with the third world.
[03:51:56.672 --> 03:51:58.372]  They're saying it out in the open.
[03:51:59.728 --> 03:52:06.854]  Democrats are saying on the news that the people we care about the most are undocumented Americans, whatever the hell that means, right?
[03:52:08.435 --> 03:52:13.699]  They're making their priorities clear that illegals are a priority over veterans.
[03:52:15.601 --> 03:52:20.465]  And we're seeing this, that they're emptying elementary schools in New York to bring in the illegals.
[03:52:20.885 --> 03:52:23.227]  We're watching all of this in real time.
[03:52:23.587 --> 03:52:25.269]  And just wait till these people get activated.
[03:52:25.909 --> 03:52:27.550]  Wait till that operation comes to a
[03:52:29.273 --> 03:52:30.334]  Comes to its next phase.
[03:52:30.374 --> 03:52:35.719]  We're watching the phase of importation, occupation.
[03:52:36.660 --> 03:52:38.721]  Activation is coming next with these illegals.
[03:52:38.922 --> 03:52:39.422]  Wait till that.
[03:52:39.462 --> 03:52:40.323]  Strap up, America.
[03:52:41.161 --> 03:52:43.122]  By tons of guns, tons of ammunition.
[03:52:43.582 --> 03:52:45.343]  Don't rely on 911, I'll tell you that.
[03:52:45.363 --> 03:52:47.724]  Don't rely on the military.
[03:52:47.744 --> 03:52:50.025]  Are you going to rely on law enforcement right now?
[03:52:50.085 --> 03:52:50.225]  No.
[03:52:50.245 --> 03:52:53.707]  When these people get activated, it's going to get really, really bad.
[03:52:53.727 --> 03:52:57.608]  And I'm not advocating to go on the offense and kill people.
[03:52:57.668 --> 03:53:00.070]  What I'm saying is always be ready.
[03:53:00.250 --> 03:53:07.053]  Second Amendment 2A up to the teeth, you and your family, and be ready for self-defense because that day will come.
[03:53:07.073 --> 03:53:09.934]  What do you think these people are here to just live a better life?
[03:53:10.990 --> 03:53:14.851]  You think these illegals are here just because they want to mow your lawn?
[03:53:16.592 --> 03:53:16.912]  No, dude.
[03:53:16.932 --> 03:53:18.732]  These people are here to replace you and they even know it.
[03:53:20.213 --> 03:53:22.333]  They're here to replace you and they even know it.
[03:53:22.373 --> 03:53:28.075]  And wait until they get activated violently like they have in Europe, like they have in France, and like they have in Germany.
[03:53:28.095 --> 03:53:29.676]  It's going to happen here in America as well.
[03:53:29.896 --> 03:53:31.116]  It's not fear-mongering.
[03:53:31.636 --> 03:53:32.316]  Give it some time.
[03:53:32.356 --> 03:53:32.857]  It'll happen.
[03:53:33.017 --> 03:53:33.677]  Give it some time.
[03:53:33.877 --> 03:53:40.619]  Because they're in the phase, like I said, of importation, occupation, and they will be activated at some point in the near future.
[03:53:41.533 --> 03:53:45.900]  Especially if they rig the election again and we're just totally screwed.
[03:53:45.920 --> 03:53:46.801]  We're going to lose the country.
[03:53:47.081 --> 03:53:48.504]  We are going to lose this country.
[03:53:49.525 --> 03:53:51.208]  We need divine intervention is what we need.
[03:53:52.697 --> 03:53:53.337]  We need Christ.
[03:53:53.377 --> 03:53:53.997]  We need God.
[03:53:54.037 --> 03:53:56.458]  We need full national repentance to heal our land.
[03:53:56.498 --> 03:53:57.499]  We haven't had that yet.
[03:53:57.519 --> 03:53:58.279]  It hasn't happened.
[03:53:58.519 --> 03:54:01.260]  This whole country worships homosexuality.
[03:54:01.520 --> 03:54:05.421]  This whole country worships depravity and sexual immorality.
[03:54:05.681 --> 03:54:08.602]  This country worships slaughtering babies on a daily basis.
[03:54:08.882 --> 03:54:11.383]  Not you, the viewer, that's against this.
[03:54:12.203 --> 03:54:16.345]  But collectively, this nation's culture is built on those foundations.
[03:54:16.425 --> 03:54:20.286]  Everything opposite of Christ, the Bible, and biblical principles.
[03:54:21.565 --> 03:54:27.428]  Nationally, when this culture finally decides to bow to Christ, then we're gonna see some change.
[03:54:27.548 --> 03:54:29.349]  But we haven't gotten there yet, guys.
[03:54:30.510 --> 03:54:31.370]  We haven't gotten there yet.
[03:54:31.410 --> 03:54:37.894]  So I'm interested to see what direction this nation goes in, especially after November here in 2024.
[03:54:38.454 --> 03:54:41.856]  But one thing I will say is don't underestimate these people.
[03:54:42.654 --> 03:54:44.736]  And the lengths that they're willing to go.
[03:54:44.776 --> 03:54:46.998]  It's not just about they want to deceive you.
[03:54:47.058 --> 03:55:01.729]  It's not just about they want to prove themselves as more psychologically advanced and they have the ability to manipulate you and they're just having meetings at hotels and behind closed doors just laughing at everybody.
[03:55:01.769 --> 03:55:02.530]  They're doing that.
[03:55:02.890 --> 03:55:03.751]  It's not about that.
[03:55:03.851 --> 03:55:08.554]  We know this is about power, control, and obedience and allegiance to Lucifer.
[03:55:10.756 --> 03:55:11.697]  And so with that,
[03:55:12.406 --> 03:55:12.947]  We're good to go.
[03:55:34.608 --> 03:55:35.008]  We're good to go.
[03:55:35.069 --> 03:55:36.110]  We're good to go.
[03:55:46.849 --> 03:55:49.171]  Because we are gaining traction.
[03:55:50.411 --> 03:56:00.658]  The populist movement and the info war and people waking up to the truth as you share the links and you share the transmissions and you get the intel out there and you have your own conversations with people.
[03:56:00.738 --> 03:56:03.220]  People are waking up to what the Great Reset is.
[03:56:03.260 --> 03:56:15.628]  People are waking up to who Klaus Schwab is and the WEF and people are waking up to how everything is engineered against you and the economy, the media, everything.
[03:56:16.610 --> 03:56:17.410]  We're good to go.
[03:56:42.828 --> 03:56:43.989]  It's pulled out of the matrix.
[03:56:44.129 --> 03:56:48.712]  Every mind that gets jacked out of the simulation, their fear increases.
[03:56:49.032 --> 03:56:50.753]  Their paranoia increases.
[03:56:51.253 --> 03:57:04.802]  Therefore, their operations through desperation, fear, and paranoia will become more aggressive, will become more sophisticated, will become more frequent, and will become more out in the open.
[03:57:04.862 --> 03:57:06.103]  People will respond to that.
[03:57:07.273 --> 03:57:15.558]  They will either identify it as an insane, tyrannical machine that claims to be democratically elected and functioning.
[03:57:15.578 --> 03:57:19.500]  We live in a constitutional republic, even the rhinos will say.
[03:57:19.520 --> 03:57:23.142]  Or people are going to just accept it.
[03:57:23.963 --> 03:57:25.444]  And people are going to have to make a decision.
[03:57:25.764 --> 03:57:28.646]  And it's going to be accompanied with technological advancements.
[03:57:29.326 --> 03:57:30.247]  So don't be a sitting duck.
[03:57:30.287 --> 03:57:31.748]  Don't become a zombie and just tap out.
[03:57:31.808 --> 03:57:32.208]  Be ready.
[03:57:32.288 --> 03:57:32.668]  Learn.
[03:57:33.008 --> 03:57:33.348]  Learn.
[03:57:33.629 --> 03:57:33.929]  Learn.
[03:57:33.949 --> 03:57:34.549]  Advanced.
[03:57:34.569 --> 03:57:35.049]  Advanced.
[03:57:35.250 --> 03:57:35.750]  Advanced.
[03:57:38.169 --> 03:57:40.212]  With the culture, as they learn as well.
[03:57:40.673 --> 03:57:41.694]  This is how we fight back.
[03:57:41.794 --> 03:57:42.936]  We become the culture.
[03:57:42.956 --> 03:57:44.859]  Alright guys, War Room's coming up next.
[03:57:44.879 --> 03:57:45.580]  Thank you.
[03:57:47.813 --> 03:57:49.074]  Gunther in Tennessee.
[03:57:49.114 --> 03:57:50.095]  Thanks for calling, Gunther.
[03:57:50.115 --> 03:57:50.655]  Hey, Alex.
[03:57:50.836 --> 03:57:51.616]  First time caller.
[03:57:51.676 --> 03:57:53.538]  Real quick, wanted to plug your foundational energy.
[03:57:54.078 --> 03:57:55.039]  Just started taking that.
[03:57:55.719 --> 03:57:58.782]  And, boy, three pills, recommended dose.
[03:57:58.862 --> 03:58:00.023]  I was bouncing off the walls.
[03:58:00.143 --> 03:58:05.768]  But I tell you, foundational is the right name for that product because I'll cut down to one.
[03:58:06.889 --> 03:58:10.632]  It's like you have a baseline of energy that you were missing before that you got back.
[03:58:10.752 --> 03:58:10.852]  So...
[03:58:11.032 --> 03:58:19.274]  Well, I'm glad you mentioned that because it's methylfolate, the breakdown of folic acid, and a lot of people, particularly Europeans, don't absorb all of the folic acid.
[03:58:19.514 --> 03:58:20.615]  So it's not a stimulant.
[03:58:20.835 --> 03:58:24.256]  It's a totally natural thing that boosts energy that's foundational.
[03:58:24.536 --> 03:58:27.097]  And was I lying to you or did it not work?
[03:58:27.797 --> 03:58:28.977]  No, it was top-notch.
[03:58:29.037 --> 03:58:32.658]  And I was actually taking Red Pill Plus before, and that's got a little folic acid in it.
[03:58:32.698 --> 03:58:36.479]  I think there was a little buildup from this, but the energy from this was no jitters.
[03:58:36.679 --> 03:58:37.620]  I mean, it's top-notch.
[03:58:37.700 --> 03:58:38.400]  It's a great product.
[03:58:38.837 --> 03:58:39.778]  Well, thank you so much.
[03:58:39.838 --> 03:58:40.138]  Yeah, no.
[03:58:40.258 --> 03:58:43.602]  Folic acid's great and it's in real red pill, but some can't break it down.
[03:58:43.622 --> 03:58:44.623]  This is the breakdown of it.
[03:58:44.703 --> 03:58:45.484]  That's exactly it.
[03:58:46.625 --> 03:58:52.090]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[03:58:52.831 --> 03:58:57.115]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[03:58:57.516 --> 03:59:01.900]  We finally have a limited run back in supply at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:59:03.301 --> 03:59:06.083]  So many people have serious issues.
[03:59:06.364 --> 03:59:07.485]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[03:59:07.925 --> 03:59:13.349]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[03:59:13.870 --> 03:59:19.274]  Most of their iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[03:59:19.914 --> 03:59:22.817]  But this is pure atomic certified iodine.
[03:59:25.505 --> 03:59:28.566]  X2 is now back in stock, discounted.
[03:59:28.906 --> 03:59:32.087]  So I'm giving Thanksgiving right now for this product being here.
[03:59:32.427 --> 03:59:37.528]  It funds the InfoWar, but I guarantee you, you take this for a few weeks, you will feel the difference.
[03:59:37.688 --> 03:59:38.488]  It is amazing.
[03:59:38.808 --> 03:59:44.810]  It's the missing link, X2, back in stock at the end of 2023 at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:59:45.250 --> 03:59:45.650]  X2.
[03:59:47.991 --> 03:59:53.892]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
