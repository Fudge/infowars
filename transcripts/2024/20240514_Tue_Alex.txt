[00:00:01.141 --> 00:00:06.902]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:08.183 --> 00:00:21.366]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and support the InfoWars.
[00:00:21.486 --> 00:00:28.207]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the InfoWars and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:00:28.307 --> 00:00:30.488]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:00:32.527 --> 00:00:37.728]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.728 --> 00:00:55.007]   The southern border of the United States is wide open, and the federal government has been
[00:00:55.007 --> 00:01:00.688]   conducting a wide-scale criminal operation of flooding the country with unvetted foreigners,
[00:01:00.688 --> 00:01:06.206]   distributing them across the United States, and providing them with homes and financial support.
[00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:14.487]  The GOP's talking point has been that this is all about election fraud, but this has been happening all across the Western world for over a decade.
[00:01:14.848 --> 00:01:17.430]  This is something far more sinister than election fraud.
[00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.733]  The Population Division of the United Nations concerns themselves with international migration.
[00:01:24.153 --> 00:01:31.776]  In the year 2000, they published Replacement Migration, a solution put forth to deal with declining and aging populations.
[00:01:32.276 --> 00:01:34.737]  For years, we were told that this was a conspiracy theory.
[00:01:35.018 --> 00:01:42.301]  But now that we are seeing tens of millions murdered by the experimental shots, it is becoming more clear what the objective is.
[00:01:42.921 --> 00:01:49.906]  We are told that these are poor families fleeing tyranny, but there are massive amounts of healthy young men without any families.
[00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:58.032]  And time and time again, we have seen them act violently against the native population with very little repercussions from the law.
[00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:09.660]  As we are expecting the announcement of Disease X and another lockdown, a recent report from UK's Jim Ferguson provides a plausible explanation of what we are seeing.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.900]  This isn't normal.
[00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:11.921]  There's something not right.
[00:02:11.941 --> 00:02:14.021]  This isn't just refugees coming in.
[00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:16.522]  These aren't people fleeing from some kind of war zone.
[00:02:16.582 --> 00:02:21.423]  These are predominantly men, aged between 25 and 35.
[00:02:22.363 --> 00:02:27.324]  Young, fighting-age men, as my old boss Nigel Farage once referred to them, and I think he's right.
[00:02:27.765 --> 00:02:29.285]  John, what do you think's going on here, mate?
[00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:36.721]  So I can tell you these are UN soldiers and they will be deployed by the WHO when they announce the next pandemic lockdown.
[00:02:37.061 --> 00:02:37.961]  That's what's going to happen.
[00:02:38.282 --> 00:02:40.142]  They've been trained by British soldiers.
[00:02:40.322 --> 00:02:42.863]  They've been trained by the Black Watch Regiment.
[00:02:42.883 --> 00:02:47.785]  They were training them in Antalya in Turkey and in the east of Ukraine.
[00:02:47.966 --> 00:02:50.146]  They're predominantly down to sergeant ranks.
[00:02:50.186 --> 00:02:51.427]  They're then shipped to France.
[00:02:51.807 --> 00:02:53.608]  They all sign the Official Secrets Act.
[00:02:54.088 --> 00:02:55.170]  Then they're ferried over.
[00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.759]  If you were fleeing war and tyranny, I don't know about you, but I would certainly take my wife and children with me.
[00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:02.041]  They're most precious.
[00:03:02.421 --> 00:03:03.503]  They're my prized asset.
[00:03:04.068 --> 00:03:05.329]  You know, they're everything to me.
[00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:07.910]  If you're going to war, you go to war with the lads.
[00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.531]  They're going to be deployed.
[00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:10.511]  They will be deployed.
[00:03:10.711 --> 00:03:12.712]  John, I mean, you say you've spoken to people in the Black Watch.
[00:03:12.772 --> 00:03:15.914]  I mean, the Black Watch, a very famous, you know, regiment.
[00:03:16.734 --> 00:03:18.435]  Are they actually going along with this?
[00:03:18.895 --> 00:03:19.696]  They've got no choice.
[00:03:19.796 --> 00:03:21.897]  Well, I kind of said, you know, why are you doing it?
[00:03:21.917 --> 00:03:23.278]  And he said, soldiers follow orders.
[00:03:23.598 --> 00:03:25.359]  What you're going to see is the following.
[00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:27.700]  We'll have a minister somewhere in cabinets.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.360]   suddenly come up with a great idea on how we're going to get these guys to contribute to help us
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.039]   and they're going to put them in uniforms. A couple of people have told me these uniforms
[00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:43.480]   are burgundy, others have told me they're UN blue. I really don't know, I guess we'll see when they
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.600]   deploy them. They are going to be deployed because otherwise if they announced another lockdown what
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.840]   would everyone say? They'd say bollocks and they'd go about their business wouldn't they? They're
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.399]   going to need armed young men in uniform to try and enforce it. Why do they import young men from the east?
[00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:07.942]  Because traditionally, if you want to kill and tyrannize white people, you put black soldiers in, because there's a cultural disassociation.
[00:04:08.443 --> 00:04:09.644]  And that's their method.
[00:04:09.725 --> 00:04:11.748]  That's the way these globalists are going to do it.
[00:04:11.828 --> 00:04:21.004]   You know, in America, When it was a colony of the United Kingdom, of Britain, there was a revolution against British colonial rule.
[00:04:21.384 --> 00:04:21.845]  That's right.
[00:04:22.425 --> 00:04:34.453]  And, you know, a lot of people didn't realise, but it was only 3% of those people in America that overthrew the British forces and basically got rid of them.
[00:04:35.514 --> 00:04:36.595]  3% of the population, John.
[00:04:36.815 --> 00:04:37.776]  I look forward to it.
[00:04:37.896 --> 00:04:38.316]  I'm ready.
[00:04:38.988 --> 00:04:39.428]  I'm ready.
[00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.511]  I can't wait because I know it's going to be the beginning of the end for them.
[00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:44.072]  I do foresee victory.
[00:04:44.092 --> 00:04:46.694]  I see that at very great cost.
[00:04:47.015 --> 00:04:47.875]  But we will see it.
[00:04:48.216 --> 00:04:53.460]  And people, I think the world will become closer than ever when we do see victory.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.803]  It's going to come on the back of a loaded bloodshed and unfortunately it has to.
[00:04:57.123 --> 00:05:03.668]  Once people of all colors come together and recognize their common enemy, we'll walk over these people in 10 minutes.
[00:05:04.049 --> 00:05:07.049]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[00:05:07.049 --> 00:05:11.449]  He is a very respected man in the UK with a lot of contacts.
[00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.349]  It is going down, folks.
[00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:23.149]   Very respected journalists and whistleblowers in the UK have confirmed with the military
[00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:28.549]   that these brigades of military-age men we've seen being brought into Europe and the United States
[00:05:28.549 --> 00:05:36.448]   under the UN banner and the UN NGOs are pre-positioning paramilitary inside the United States and
[00:05:36.448 --> 00:05:37.448]  in Europe.
[00:05:37.448 --> 00:05:38.948]  And they're being trained.
[00:05:38.948 --> 00:05:48.948]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:05:40.458 --> 00:05:43.900]  By the United Nations in places like Ukraine and Turkey.
[00:05:46.121 --> 00:05:52.083]  There's a report by Greg Rees, I just posted it, huge UN troops being brought in as migrant refugees.
[00:05:52.664 --> 00:06:04.569]  And then I have the other prong of the UN invasion here, an excellent little boil down, I know all this is accurate, that a city council in Canada where they just lay out, it's in 2030 there, but whether you're in Australia, the US, Germany, Canada, doesn't matter.
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.422]  It's the same global project, the same New World Order system, so we're going to get to that report in a minute.
[00:06:11.502 --> 00:06:14.163]  We are also going to open the phones up today.
[00:06:14.183 --> 00:06:23.487]  We have a special guest joining us that Justin Trudeau in Canada has said is a terrorist basically, who founded the joke named Diagonalon.
[00:06:23.887 --> 00:06:28.169]  You've heard the leader of Canada say that I'm an extremist threat, so is Diagonalon.
[00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:33.508]   It's like saying you're a Your poodle is going to go out and attack somebody.
[00:06:34.268 --> 00:06:37.069]  Absolutely made up crap, but they could stage false flags to blame us.
[00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:38.429]  And again, you're like, why do we care about Canada?
[00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:44.372]  Well, it's geographically almost as big as the U.S., full of resources, and it's a globalist beachhead to our north.
[00:06:44.892 --> 00:06:46.572]  We're all under attack by the same New World Order.
[00:06:46.872 --> 00:06:48.973]  All right, huge developments in the poison shot front.
[00:06:49.373 --> 00:06:51.934]  Melinda Gates has resigned from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:06:53.035 --> 00:06:59.217]  We also have the head of the private Federal Reserve saying inflation has been higher than thought, as we told you.
[00:07:01.013 --> 00:07:02.934]  Expects rates to hold steady.
[00:07:02.974 --> 00:07:03.774]  They may even raise them.
[00:07:03.794 --> 00:07:04.775]  That's what we've been predicting.
[00:07:06.836 --> 00:07:09.337]  We also have what happened over the weekend.
[00:07:10.837 --> 00:07:18.981]  Corporate news headlines that Ukraine was repulsing Russian advances in the east of Ukraine beautifully and having great victories.
[00:07:19.001 --> 00:07:21.962]  Of course, I just went and checked the Russian news.
[00:07:24.073 --> 00:07:26.855]  Lie about 10% of the time instead of 98% of the time.
[00:07:27.035 --> 00:07:27.655]  They lied too.
[00:07:28.055 --> 00:07:29.176]  They said they weren't going to invade Ukraine.
[00:07:29.196 --> 00:07:30.837]  I told you they were two and a half years ago.
[00:07:30.857 --> 00:07:34.519]  Some of the reporters on it got really upset with me when they were putting that disinfo out.
[00:07:34.559 --> 00:07:36.440]  I said, no, you're getting ready to invade the next few days.
[00:07:37.401 --> 00:07:38.381]  But so they lied too.
[00:07:38.461 --> 00:07:41.843]  But they didn't lie about the advancements.
[00:07:42.083 --> 00:07:48.247]  And so now days later, Kiev replaces key commander amid Russia's advance.
[00:07:49.307 --> 00:07:50.828]  So their military is totally imploding.
[00:07:50.867 --> 00:07:56.028]   But if you watch the news or what slugs X or Instagram or anything else,
[00:07:56.028 --> 00:07:58.867]  all you will see is Ukrainians killing Russians.
[00:07:58.867 --> 00:08:01.487]   That's because the Russians really aren't spending their time putting out video of
[00:08:01.487 --> 00:08:02.187]  killing people.
[00:08:02.187 --> 00:08:04.507]  That's only the image they want to have.
[00:08:04.507 --> 00:08:10.507]   But for every Ukrainian soldier, for every Russian soldier that's dying,
[00:08:10.507 --> 00:08:12.307]  it's estimated there's two Ukrainian dying.
[00:08:12.307 --> 00:08:20.668]   So this morning, I spent about an hour just on X searching the term Ukraine war.
[00:08:20.668 --> 00:08:23.666]  And it is the most brutal stuff.
[00:08:23.604 --> 00:08:25.805]  I mean, just hundreds of clips.
[00:08:26.345 --> 00:08:31.547]  I watched more than 30, but hundreds and hundreds of clips just in the main feed, probably thousands.
[00:08:31.567 --> 00:08:38.829]  I just stopped at a few hundred going over them of people being blown in half by drone attacks from small drones.
[00:08:39.109 --> 00:08:41.230]  And I just want you to understand this is robot war.
[00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:50.792]  And this is what's coming to a town near you in the future that we've been warning of for decades.
[00:08:51.893 --> 00:09:00.856]  So I've got a compilation of some of these videos and viewer discretion is advised.
[00:09:01.687 --> 00:09:06.111]  We'll cover all that in the first two hours and talk to Jeremy McKenzie, the founder of Diagonal On.
[00:09:07.052 --> 00:09:07.913]  We've talked to him before.
[00:09:07.933 --> 00:09:09.714]  Nice guy, smart guy.
[00:09:10.575 --> 00:09:11.536]  RagingDissident.com.
[00:09:11.576 --> 00:09:12.257]  He's coming up.
[00:09:12.277 --> 00:09:13.498]  Maria Z hosts the fourth hour.
[00:09:13.518 --> 00:09:17.221]  Owen Schroer, The War Room, 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:18.562]  Central Standard Time.
[00:09:19.663 --> 00:09:20.144]  Okay!
[00:09:22.226 --> 00:09:23.587]  What else are we going to be getting to?
[00:09:23.647 --> 00:09:26.089]  Boy, there is a lot of it here.
[00:09:26.109 --> 00:09:27.811]  A lot that we need to get to.
[00:09:28.539 --> 00:09:32.660]  Belgian government will intervene to ensure prostitutes do as pimps tell them.
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.000]  Sex slavery, feminists are hailing it.
[00:09:36.861 --> 00:09:37.021]  Yeah.
[00:09:37.781 --> 00:09:40.122]  Men competing in women's sports, hailed by feminists.
[00:09:41.022 --> 00:09:42.702]  Men in women's bathrooms, hailed by feminists.
[00:09:42.742 --> 00:09:44.502]  Men raping women in prison, hailed by feminists.
[00:09:45.683 --> 00:09:47.243]  Women as sex slaves, hailed by feminists.
[00:09:47.263 --> 00:09:47.903]  Figured it out yet?
[00:09:49.183 --> 00:09:53.404]  Also, we're going to be getting into some of the incredible developments with ICE.
[00:09:53.283 --> 00:09:57.962]   expected to roll out ID program for illegal aliens this summer out of the
[00:09:57.962 --> 00:10:03.524]   election so they can vote in blue districts around the country. Absolutely
[00:10:03.524 --> 00:10:08.323]  wild information on that front.
[00:10:06.886 --> 00:10:18.529]  President Trump gave a powerful speech outside of the courthouse last night saying he's going to challenge the gag order and he basically did and said the whole thing is a giant political fraud.
[00:10:19.109 --> 00:10:21.830]  It's all coming up but I want to be clear about the UN invasion.
[00:10:23.365 --> 00:10:23.986]  The U.N.
[00:10:24.046 --> 00:10:29.010]  invasion doesn't come with a bunch of blue helmets invading like Red Dawn or something.
[00:10:30.051 --> 00:10:31.292]  It comes with the U.N.
[00:10:31.372 --> 00:10:55.889]   coming in in the last 30 years, under agenda 2020, now agenda 2030, agenda 21, now agenda 2030, and taking over local governments bureaucratically and then tapping into taxpayer money to then be able to run the policies of your local government, whether you're in Sweden, Or whether you're in Canada or whether you're in Australia, it's the same in the Western world.
[00:10:56.229 --> 00:11:01.998]  Just like the UN's over health policy and during the whole COVID thing, it was like, what does the UN say?
[00:11:02.058 --> 00:11:04.021]  The UN says this, the UN's in charge of that.
[00:11:04.041 --> 00:11:06.484]  The UN says we can't in the lockdown yet.
[00:11:07.481 --> 00:11:23.151]  So yes, it's being confirmed and we have the report by Greg Rees with major, very credible whistleblowers saying that they've talked to the British military and in particular units that they've been training these military men to come across our borders here in the United States and Europe.
[00:11:23.591 --> 00:11:36.719]  Well, you can look at the videos where you'll see 50 men, 100 men, 300 men, 500 men with the same boots, the same backpacks, and I said they all look like low-level officers, command and control, communications people.
[00:11:37.734 --> 00:11:40.577]  And they're obviously military.
[00:11:41.377 --> 00:11:44.540]  Now, some small groups say, we're here from Iran, we're going to kill you.
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.601]  That's been caught on tape.
[00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:50.246]  People face scan the individuals and find out they are really Hezbollah operatives.
[00:11:50.326 --> 00:11:51.106]  That's going on.
[00:11:52.087 --> 00:11:59.254]  But mainly, they are Muslims who've been sheep dipped.
[00:12:01.047 --> 00:12:08.451]  By the UN and turned into these operatives and they're also out of Latin America trained by the UN.
[00:12:09.392 --> 00:12:12.934]  So there is that final level to have these forces here.
[00:12:12.954 --> 00:12:19.017]  Remember Obama said we needed domestic security force just as big and just as strong as our military and that's going to be contingent of it.
[00:12:19.757 --> 00:12:24.780]  But I don't really expect them to be running the lockdowns during the next viral scare.
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:31.112]   But more importantly simply Carrying out terror attacks and burning the country down.
[00:12:31.692 --> 00:12:36.993]  Because they know anti-fun on the left are not going to be strategic enough or do it on a wide enough scale.
[00:12:37.494 --> 00:12:39.614]  They want pinpointed strikes but also massive strikes.
[00:12:41.275 --> 00:12:42.115]  That's why they're here.
[00:12:42.775 --> 00:12:44.176]  And they issue them U.N.
[00:12:44.476 --> 00:12:48.997]  State Department funded phones so they can all be commanded and controlled as well.
[00:12:49.096 --> 00:12:54.775]   So Senator Blumenthal said three months ago that there is legislation, a legislative coup
[00:12:54.775 --> 00:13:02.855]   against the executive to strip the power of the Insurrection Act from the president
[00:13:02.855 --> 00:13:06.697]   last used by George Walker Bush during the LA riots in 1992.
[00:13:06.697 --> 00:13:10.256]  And so that itself is a legislative coup.
[00:13:10.256 --> 00:13:12.816]   Since when is legislative branch, they control the power of the purse,
[00:13:12.816 --> 00:13:18.135]   but they don't control the execution or the orders of it by the executive branch.
[00:13:18.135 --> 00:13:24.016]   So they'd rather just normalize all this where you just wake up and you're under UN regulation,
[00:13:24.016 --> 00:13:27.576]  UN control, the world UN ID standardized.
[00:13:27.576 --> 00:13:29.096]  It'll still have the American flag on it.
[00:13:29.096 --> 00:13:33.535]   It'll still have American seal, but it will be a UN global database.
[00:13:33.677 --> 00:13:34.818]  That's official, that's happening.
[00:13:35.919 --> 00:13:37.300]  Being announced all over the world, not just here.
[00:13:38.021 --> 00:13:39.882]  Actually rolled out in areas of Europe and now in Canada.
[00:13:41.183 --> 00:13:44.646]  So that's what they want to do, but they do have a backup force.
[00:13:46.628 --> 00:13:49.130]  Just since Biden got in, it's over 20 million, not 12 million.
[00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:51.011]  Tucker Carlson's had experts on, I agree with him.
[00:13:51.772 --> 00:13:54.314]  It's about 22 million, 25 million on the high end.
[00:13:54.874 --> 00:14:00.758]   Several million Because you notice they either show up in groups of women alone, or women with kids, or that it's whole groups of men.
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:11.329]  And sometimes it's whole groups of men from the Caribbean and things, and you can see their dress and what they're doing and tell that they are economic refugees.
[00:14:12.229 --> 00:14:16.734]  They don't have the look of military, they don't have the key tell-tale signs.
[00:14:16.794 --> 00:14:20.477]  And you can look at military men from around the world and say, are those grunts?
[00:14:21.621 --> 00:14:23.043]  Are those people wet behind the ears?
[00:14:23.123 --> 00:14:25.166]  Are those mossbacks?
[00:14:26.127 --> 00:14:54.607]   And the groups of men coming in, you can see are from the captain major level down to Down to sergeants, and that's exactly what the whistleblowers in the UK that are in Greg Rich's report said, is that it's, you know, that mid-range non-commissioned officer and some commissioned officers, and that they've signed agreements with the UN, trained by British troops and others.
[00:14:55.148 --> 00:14:56.148]  And you'd have to know that.
[00:14:56.188 --> 00:14:56.949]  I've done the research.
[00:14:57.249 --> 00:15:02.312]  It's the British, or mainly training troops and foreign brigades in Ukraine.
[00:15:03.072 --> 00:15:05.014]  But they're also sending a lot of them here.
[00:15:05.594 --> 00:15:07.836]  They're also training them in Turkey and in Poland.
[00:15:08.677 --> 00:15:12.840]  So, people have a normalcy bias to think, oh, that'll never happen here.
[00:15:13.441 --> 00:15:15.983]  Think of all the things you never thought would happen that are happening now.
[00:15:17.685 --> 00:15:28.274]  So, they need the guys that'll do this, who'll disappear into the woodwork, who are brown-skinned, so they can blame it on Muslims, they can blame it on whoever they want.
[00:15:29.335 --> 00:15:30.416]  And then they just disappear.
[00:15:31.276 --> 00:15:33.477]  And then they just, you know, fade out.
[00:15:35.118 --> 00:15:40.180]  And so there's a very large shadow army in Europe and the United States.
[00:15:41.521 --> 00:15:45.923]  And I just have to tell you that it's not a coincidence that InfoWars is very close to being shuttered.
[00:15:46.944 --> 00:15:49.265]  And that all this is happening because we're down to the line here.
[00:15:50.166 --> 00:16:18.806]   Across the board and people are waking up and probably about 150,000 or more people in New Jersey and it's beautiful, but it's precisely Because the entire globalist agenda is falling apart, that they're not giving up, they're doubling down, and only admitting how much extreme danger we're in, and how deep the infiltration is, and how deeply the country and the world's been compromised, can we effectively know what's going down to stop it?
[00:16:19.546 --> 00:16:24.649]  I mean, Congress is just now figuring out that big tech works with the CIA to censor Americans and spy on Congress.
[00:16:25.289 --> 00:16:28.911]  They're just now figuring out that all the cell phones are tracked in live time, everything you say has been recorded.
[00:16:29.611 --> 00:16:30.833]  They've been stonewalled for decades.
[00:16:31.114 --> 00:16:33.418]  They're just not figuring out that the border is completely gone.
[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:39.468]  So to sit there and say we're under giant infiltration, whether you're in Chicago...
[00:16:40.438 --> 00:16:55.403]  Whether you're in Portland, whether you're in Seattle, whether you're in Houston, whether you're in New York, whether you're in San Francisco, whether you're in Los Angeles, they're putting foreigners who aren't even citizens on all the keyboards for law enforcement and elections and infrastructure.
[00:16:55.443 --> 00:16:56.643]  They're just getting you used to it.
[00:16:57.203 --> 00:17:01.825]  Chicago's passed a law so New Mexico as a state has to hire illegal aliens as police.
[00:17:03.191 --> 00:17:05.732]  And of course they're saying the main military will now be illegal aliens.
[00:17:05.772 --> 00:17:13.355]  So remember the Senators six months ago and the Democrats and then Biden said, our main recruiting group now will be the migrants.
[00:17:14.416 --> 00:17:18.537]  And then Biden said last week, the migrants are the best citizens.
[00:17:20.538 --> 00:17:21.719]  They're the most conscientious.
[00:17:21.779 --> 00:17:23.219]  They're not even citizens, but they're the best.
[00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:25.920]  So they're a protected group.
[00:17:26.861 --> 00:17:29.082]  They don't get the shots when they come in because they're in arming.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.142]  They signed the women up and their kids for welfare, the Democrats skim part of.
[00:17:33.462 --> 00:17:37.424]  They put them to work also in factories and jobs, take more jobs from Americans.
[00:17:38.004 --> 00:17:41.687]  This is total full spectrum warfare against you and your family.
[00:17:42.587 --> 00:17:45.749]  And it's a slow war, but it's been, it's a slow boil.
[00:17:46.368 --> 00:17:51.769]   And so it's been going for a long time, but it's like slowly turning up the heat in the frog
[00:17:51.769 --> 00:17:55.807]   and the frog just kind of gets dizzy and passes out and never knows what hit it.
[00:17:55.807 --> 00:17:59.249]   The water's now boiling, our feet are burning on the bottom of the pan.
[00:17:59.249 --> 00:18:00.727]  It's time to jump out.
[00:18:00.727 --> 00:18:03.028]  We have to talk about what jumping out means.
[00:18:03.028 --> 00:18:07.288]   We're trying to jump out, electing good people, shutting off the BlackRock money,
[00:18:07.288 --> 00:18:11.608]   trying to secure the border, trying to get Trump elected, trying to get ready, trying to warn people.
[00:18:11.608 --> 00:18:18.207]   But the globalists are gonna stage terror attacks and say, "We did it," to demonize us
[00:18:18.207 --> 00:18:20.928]  trying to get out of the pot of boiling water.
[00:18:21.344 --> 00:18:32.671]  So here's a report, a breakdown from a city council in Canada and the individual just gets up there as a citizen and nails his info 100% not exaggerated, dead on about the UN control.
[00:18:33.252 --> 00:18:37.814]  So they've already got most of your city councils, they've already got your county commissions, they've already got all that.
[00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:43.238]  Every major city in Europe and here is sanctuary city for illegals.
[00:18:45.374 --> 00:18:47.736]  The invasion is already deep.
[00:18:48.836 --> 00:18:50.538]  We're already far along in it.
[00:18:51.938 --> 00:18:53.119]  Not a question of it's coming.
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:54.520]  It's here.
[00:18:55.161 --> 00:19:00.584]  But the good ol' boys are always, I see you in blue helmet boy, I'm gonna blast your ass!
[00:19:01.745 --> 00:19:03.706]  Well they don't run around in blue helmets.
[00:19:04.266 --> 00:19:09.430]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're your mayors, they're your county commissioners, they're your police chiefs in many areas.
[00:19:10.503 --> 00:19:11.323]  And they're not all bad.
[00:19:11.944 --> 00:19:18.087]  They weren't able to fully take over law enforcement, that's why they've been demonizing it and cutting its funding to bully it into submission and then bring in their people.
[00:19:18.408 --> 00:19:21.169]  They cut the funding to fire half the force, then they bring in their people.
[00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:26.232]  So, they need a free hand for their violent revolution because they're losing.
[00:19:27.232 --> 00:19:29.232]  Let's go to this city council break now.
[00:19:29.232 --> 00:19:36.272]  Good evening.
[00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:41.092]  Restructuring of Canadian mayors and municipalities under the auspices of the United Nations began in 1992.
[00:19:41.672 --> 00:19:44.534]  PM Mulroney signed Canada onto UN Agenda 21.
[00:19:45.034 --> 00:19:48.676]  Canada thus became a UN member nation-state.
[00:19:48.696 --> 00:19:51.517]  178 countries signed on, lured by the promise of big money to go green.
[00:19:52.218 --> 00:20:00.542]  By 2000, countries, including Canada, were being governed by directions of the UN G7 G20 World Economic Forum and World Health Organization, to name some.
[00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:08.328]  Every organization named is a foreign-based NGO, non-governmental organization, and every member of all these organizations is unelected.
[00:20:09.108 --> 00:20:11.529]  Parliamentary procedures for law changes weren't followed.
[00:20:12.229 --> 00:20:17.991]  In 1994, a municipal primer was issued to all local towns, outlining how they were to restructure their governments.
[00:20:18.491 --> 00:20:21.912]  Though the municipal primer was a non-binding agreement, all towns adopted it.
[00:20:22.833 --> 00:20:34.831]   Our public officials The Mayor and Councillors of that day were partnered with a private corporation, the Corporation of the Town of Aurora, who appointed a Chief Administrative Officer who helped implement the Global Agenda instead of a local one.
[00:20:35.531 --> 00:20:42.195]  The International Council on Local and Environmental Issues, ICLEI, became the main source of consultation to push and fund the Global Agenda.
[00:20:43.196 --> 00:20:53.182]  We remind you that the World Economic Forum and the United Nations signed a Strategic Partnership Framework in 2019 to jointly accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
[00:20:54.218 --> 00:21:00.702]  This is the same World Economic Forum whose chairman, Klaus Schwab, famously declared, you will own nothing and be happy.
[00:21:01.242 --> 00:21:08.126]  This is the same Klaus Schwab who, referring to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, boasted, we have penetrated more than half of his cabinet.
[00:21:09.006 --> 00:21:16.070]  We would ask Mayor Maracas and the Councillors, why should the citizens of Aurora bow down to the intrusive dictates of an unelected foreign entity?
[00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:19.232]  The fact is we should not, and we will not.
[00:21:20.772 --> 00:21:23.614]  What, you ask, does any of this have to do with 15-minute smart cities?
[00:21:24.401 --> 00:21:25.503]  Absolutely everything.
[00:21:26.105 --> 00:21:26.445]  Smart.
[00:21:26.746 --> 00:21:31.655]  S for surveillance, M for monitoring, A for analysis, R for reporting, and T for technology.
[00:21:34.289 --> 00:21:44.413]  Technology News Editor Patrick Wood, 50 years of experience and expertise on technocracy, wrote, The 15-minute city is a cover for data collection bonanza for technocrats who design and operate them.
[00:21:44.913 --> 00:21:50.555]  Cities designed for maximum efficiency always reveal technocrat thinking that efficiency itself is the goal.
[00:21:51.015 --> 00:21:55.917]  Maximum surveillance allows for maximum control to achieve even more efficiency.
[00:21:57.338 --> 00:21:59.979]  At its very root, this mechanistic thinking is anti-human.
[00:22:00.737 --> 00:22:06.401]  The 15-minute City Narrative seeks to fool you in the guise of saving the planet, keeping you safe, and delivering convenience.
[00:22:06.421 --> 00:22:10.964]  It's actually the gateway to digital IDs and CBDCs, Central Bank Digital Currencies.
[00:22:11.604 --> 00:22:19.689]  CBDCs allow bankers and or governments to freeze your bank account because you happen to peacefully and lawfully protest and express your disagreement with government policy.
[00:22:20.309 --> 00:22:28.915]  Anyone remember the truckers' convoy in Ottawa, February 22, when the Government of Canada invoked the Emergencies Act and froze the private bank accounts of law-abiding citizens?
[00:22:29.718 --> 00:22:31.999]  15-minute cities are wolves in sheep's clothing.
[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:40.744]  Don't believe the countless stories spewing forth from the 24-7 bases from the elitist-captured mainstream media, all claiming to have your best interests at heart.
[00:22:41.124 --> 00:22:42.484]  We have been burned too many times.
[00:22:43.025 --> 00:22:51.549]  In reality, 24-7 surveillance through the Internet of Things inside your home, 5G and LED streetlights outside, monitoring and tracking and recording everything.
[00:22:52.415 --> 00:22:56.037]  Implementation of exclusion zones and geofencing to restrict movement and travel.
[00:22:56.498 --> 00:23:01.160]  Ability to control behaviors through military-directed energy technologies.
[00:23:01.701 --> 00:23:03.682]  Property and car ownership to be outlawed.
[00:23:04.062 --> 00:23:07.484]  Evictions from farms and rural areas to gather people into cities.
[00:23:08.145 --> 00:23:15.389]  Digital passports being promulgated by the UN World Economic Forum and the World Health Organization are in the final stages of planning and implementation.
[00:23:16.078 --> 00:23:19.961]  They are tied to social credit score, which is determined by compliance to government directives.
[00:23:20.521 --> 00:23:23.543]  These passports control all access and all aspects of life.
[00:23:24.163 --> 00:23:27.906]  Digital currency is being implemented to end cash and monitor all your spending.
[00:23:27.926 --> 00:23:31.728]  Your digital currency will be turned off or on depending on your compliance score.
[00:23:32.409 --> 00:23:39.653]  UBI Universal Basic Income is a state-controlled allowance forcing compliance by restricting access to food, money, services, and education.
[00:23:40.274 --> 00:23:45.517]  All of the above will enable climate lockdowns to be implemented easily, arbitrarily, and indefinitely.
[00:23:46.232 --> 00:23:50.974]  The real agenda of 15-minute Smart Cities is to monitor and control everyone and everything.
[00:23:51.875 --> 00:23:57.717]  In summary, in the coming days, Council will receive an electronic info packet which will contain the text of this delegation and other items.
[00:23:58.478 --> 00:24:06.141]  We, the citizens of Aurora, wish to enter into a meaningful, respectful dialogue with our elected members of Council on this complex, important issue.
[00:24:06.761 --> 00:24:16.188]   A key framework of that dialogue is a list of questions posed to Council, Can Council explicitly guarantee that citizens will remain free to travel as is their right under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms?
[00:24:16.828 --> 00:24:23.430]  Can Council guarantee not to restrict access to essential services, medical care, bank accounts, government pensions, utilities?
[00:24:24.951 --> 00:24:37.295]  Most importantly, we the citizens of Aurora need to have the conversation with Council about exiting their non-binding agreement with a private, for-profit entity known as the Corporation of the Town of Aurora.
[00:24:37.935 --> 00:24:47.555]   We need to turn back the page to a simpler time When open, transparent municipal government serving its citizens and working in their best interests ruled the day.
[00:24:48.355 --> 00:24:50.876]  We are your equal partners on this journey.
[00:24:51.717 --> 00:24:52.057]  Thank you.
[00:24:52.637 --> 00:25:01.142]  So, here's the deal.
[00:25:02.486 --> 00:25:11.108]  When I got on there 30 years ago, there were all these MI6 and CIA whistleblowers, and FBI whistleblowers, and Congressional whistleblowers that I would interview.
[00:25:11.368 --> 00:25:14.949]  Anthony Sutton, just, G. Edward Griffin, just all of them.
[00:25:15.429 --> 00:25:17.210]  They were 100% dead on.
[00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:24.992]  The John Birch Society, if they were playing golf, they hit holes in one every time on all 18 holes.
[00:25:26.348 --> 00:25:33.012]  You go get a John Byrd Society book from 30 years ago or a magazine from 30 years ago, you open it, it's like prophecy.
[00:25:34.513 --> 00:25:39.977]  And people tune in here and they go, how the hell are there clips of this guy 20 years ago to the letter predicting all this?
[00:25:40.717 --> 00:25:46.601]  Well, when I read this stuff, when my dad was giving it to me, my uncle, when I was a little kid, a teenager, it was just back of my mind.
[00:25:46.661 --> 00:25:47.742]  It was like interesting to read.
[00:25:47.822 --> 00:25:49.223]  I thought it might be true.
[00:25:49.283 --> 00:25:49.763]  I didn't know.
[00:25:51.805 --> 00:25:54.687]  And then I grew up and I saw them implementing and I started fighting it.
[00:25:55.495 --> 00:26:05.481]  Well now, this whole takeover is so obvious and so out in the open, and admittedly a UN World Government takeover, and Germany just announced they're banning cars for people to use during the weekend.
[00:26:05.501 --> 00:26:09.384]  15-minute cities are going in all over the world.
[00:26:09.464 --> 00:26:10.205]  I mean, it's here.
[00:26:11.685 --> 00:26:23.113]  But if people simply realize that giving into this only makes it worse and that it's a total tyranny, and we can still take back our local governments and cut all this off, we will stop them.
[00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:26.711]  Yeah, they got a lot done with their lockdown.
[00:26:26.731 --> 00:26:28.292]  They got a lot done with their COVID shutdown.
[00:26:29.492 --> 00:26:30.973]  But notice how it blew up in their face now.
[00:26:31.233 --> 00:26:32.634]  And it's going to be the same across the board.
[00:26:32.654 --> 00:26:33.934]  But they're going to stage terror attacks.
[00:26:33.954 --> 00:26:34.935]  They're going to do cyber attacks.
[00:26:34.955 --> 00:26:36.096]  They're going to cut the power off.
[00:26:36.556 --> 00:26:38.237]  They're going to do all sorts of nasty stuff.
[00:26:38.357 --> 00:26:40.878]  But the good news is, people get it.
[00:26:41.983 --> 00:26:43.183]  And not just the general public.
[00:26:43.343 --> 00:26:45.384]  Prominent people get it.
[00:26:45.464 --> 00:26:47.224]  And I told Naomi Wolf about this yesterday.
[00:26:47.244 --> 00:26:48.885]  I wasn't trying to brag to her.
[00:26:48.905 --> 00:26:56.666]  I said, you see Elon Musk talking about global government being bad and 50-minute cities being bad, depopulation being bad, the collapse of civilization beginning and which has started.
[00:26:57.486 --> 00:27:01.887]  Well, I've had meetings with other big tech people and other big, big, big, big billionaires.
[00:27:01.907 --> 00:27:02.428]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:27:02.448 --> 00:27:02.948]  A lot of them.
[00:27:03.988 --> 00:27:04.648]  Off-record meetings.
[00:27:05.468 --> 00:27:06.588]  And these are well-known names.
[00:27:07.409 --> 00:27:08.729]  And they all sound like Elon Musk.
[00:27:09.713 --> 00:27:15.614]  And I've been having those meetings with those people, you know, one a year or something, different groups for the last five years.
[00:27:15.634 --> 00:27:20.815]  Of course, I've had public meetings with Elon Musk and, you know, talks, two and a half hour talks on Aaron things.
[00:27:21.616 --> 00:27:26.597]  So there are a lot of people in the establishment that aren't just acting like they're on our side.
[00:27:26.617 --> 00:27:28.117]  They're like, no, this is really horrible.
[00:27:28.517 --> 00:27:32.898]  Now that we're actually here, it was one thing for them to go along with it and make money in the system while they were building it.
[00:27:33.978 --> 00:27:35.758]  But now that it's built, they're like, we're not doing it.
[00:27:35.798 --> 00:27:36.459]  Take GCP.
[00:27:36.499 --> 00:27:36.879]  He's terrible.
[00:27:36.899 --> 00:27:37.279]  He's horrible.
[00:27:37.299 --> 00:27:38.119]  He's a competing evil.
[00:27:38.846 --> 00:27:42.612]  Ten years ago, he broke with the globalists, double-crossed them, and is now doing his own thing.
[00:27:43.533 --> 00:27:46.374]  He's doing the same operation, just trying to be ahead of us.
[00:27:46.414 --> 00:27:50.076]  But there's other people that aren't like ZZPing that are powerful that are actually against this.
[00:27:50.136 --> 00:27:52.037]  So, we've got powerful friends, folks.
[00:27:52.057 --> 00:27:52.437]  Stay with us.
[00:27:52.737 --> 00:27:54.658]  This is so, so important.

[00:28:48.893 --> 00:28:51.393]   and the newest one, "The Great Awakening - The Plan to Defeat the Globalists
[00:28:51.393 --> 00:28:52.893]  and Launch the Next Great Renaissance."
[00:28:52.893 --> 00:28:53.893]  All right.
[00:28:53.893 --> 00:28:56.893]  What's happening?
[00:28:58.393 --> 00:29:04.893]   Well, 170 plus years ago, the British government decided to fund a technological takeover
[00:29:04.893 --> 00:29:07.893]   and called for the development of all the technologies we see today.
[00:29:08.276 --> 00:29:10.117]  Francis Galton headed that project up.
[00:29:11.237 --> 00:29:25.242]  And so there is a view that the controllers are going to direct human evolution and test on the public a lot of very dangerous technologies to then develop the life extension systems that the globalists want.
[00:29:26.803 --> 00:29:27.843]  It came out last week.
[00:29:29.184 --> 00:29:42.070]  That Kim Jong-un has 10,000 doctors and scientists at the slave camps all over North Korea testing life extension in horrible experiments on the population.
[00:29:44.071 --> 00:30:04.196]   Then you see China normalizing drone swarms, in some cases with up to 5,000 drones in the night sky, with lights on them, Showing giants walking in the sky a hundred stories high, dragons flying in the sky, countdowns on New Year's.
[00:30:05.496 --> 00:30:10.800]  But how easy is it to put a small plastic explosive on each drone?
[00:30:13.021 --> 00:30:13.582]  Now the U.S.
[00:30:13.622 --> 00:30:23.679]   has tens of thousands of Predator drones and Reaper drones and big drones, but China is the leader, and then Iran and Russia after that, of actually deploying them.
[00:30:24.259 --> 00:30:28.700]  You see the footage of Ukraine using them, because the Russians have decided not to put a bunch of that out.
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:32.121]  So they don't see their tactics.
[00:30:33.161 --> 00:30:34.981]  But the Ukrainians do show it.
[00:30:36.181 --> 00:30:40.442]  Now here's a man who's had both his bottom legs blown off by a hand grenade, a Russian soldier.
[00:30:42.282 --> 00:30:45.203]  And drones dropping hand grenades into open tank hatches.
[00:30:47.833 --> 00:30:49.154]  Hundreds of new videos a day.
[00:30:50.234 --> 00:31:14.509]  So just imagine what can be done to the public with these or a thousand drones get launched against troops and each drone has 20-30 doses of nerve gas, a little sprayer, or little tablets it drops that explode with nerve gas enough to kill several people, then they just fly in over you and release the nerve gas pellets.
[00:31:16.391 --> 00:31:19.412]  And then when people die, they'll say, oh, it's a bio attack.
[00:31:21.513 --> 00:31:23.253]  Bio doesn't work as well as chemical.
[00:31:24.934 --> 00:31:29.055]  I remember decades ago writing about shows about how we would face drone armies.
[00:31:29.775 --> 00:31:31.116]  I said, oh, that's science fiction.
[00:31:31.136 --> 00:31:31.976]  That's not going to happen.
[00:31:32.976 --> 00:31:34.917]  Because they didn't want us to get out ahead of it and say no to it.
[00:31:34.937 --> 00:31:49.053]   So if you want to understand the mentality of the globalists, We are paying with our own tax money for building a system that is designed to make us obsolete and replace us.
[00:31:50.013 --> 00:31:51.414]  But they need humans in the interim.
[00:31:52.015 --> 00:31:59.920]  So the EU and Germany and the UK are all saying they may bring back conscription or the press gang, forced military service.
[00:32:02.882 --> 00:32:04.503]  Now the Russians are advancing.
[00:32:04.823 --> 00:32:05.884]  They don't want the whole country.
[00:32:05.944 --> 00:32:09.186]  They only want a few more miles, they reported, along the Eastern Front.
[00:32:10.467 --> 00:32:15.270]  Along different waterways and key strategic points so that the West could not fire missiles into Russia.
[00:32:15.851 --> 00:32:18.592]  But now the West is just giving more long-range missiles.
[00:32:19.453 --> 00:32:23.395]  So now Russia's talking about maybe we'll just take even more of Ukraine.
[00:32:24.056 --> 00:32:25.397]  Remember the headlines Friday and Saturday.
[00:32:25.477 --> 00:32:27.218]  Ukraine repulses Russian attack.
[00:32:27.478 --> 00:32:28.038]  It's never true.
[00:32:28.058 --> 00:32:29.219]  They went and looked it up.
[00:32:29.739 --> 00:32:32.982]  And now they admit Kiev replaces key commander amid Russia's advance.
[00:32:35.763 --> 00:32:38.005]  Germany looking to introduce conscription.
[00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:42.712]  We have the Chi-Coms, drone swarms.
[00:32:44.573 --> 00:32:45.894]  I want to play this video next.
[00:32:45.934 --> 00:32:48.915]  This is Ukrainians with a drone.
[00:32:50.756 --> 00:32:55.359]  And this is interesting because most of the clips you show the drone kill somebody or kill a bunch of people or blow up a tank or an armored vehicle.
[00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.221]  This is the Ukrainians with their Western-made drone.
[00:32:58.841 --> 00:33:04.925]  It flies into a Russian soldier, blows him into pieces, and then they celebrate about it.
[00:33:06.357 --> 00:33:09.419]  Well, in the future, and it's already here, those drones won't even be run by humans.
[00:33:09.439 --> 00:33:10.660]  It'll just be a truck that pulls up.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.661]  It's AI controlled by satellite.
[00:33:13.461 --> 00:33:14.762]  It'll have a hundred drones in the back.
[00:33:15.923 --> 00:33:19.625]  And it'll just sit there firing them at the humans they want to kill.
[00:33:20.906 --> 00:33:23.768]  You see how slow the US military is to adopt this?
[00:33:23.788 --> 00:33:25.689]  You see how slow the Russians are to counter it?
[00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:55.713]   All they had to do in the last two years is the Russians should issue Small, disposable, 12-gauge shotguns that you could easily produce, that's a foot-long barrel, foot-and-a-half long barrel, that has a, say, three-round cartridge on the top that loads, that you pump, it has a sight on it, and then every soldier is issued, on their backpack, the shotgun.
[00:33:57.369 --> 00:33:58.409]  And they can practice with them.
[00:33:58.869 --> 00:34:00.070]  Or the Ukrainians can do this.
[00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:03.931]  So that when a drone comes flying up, you see them look at it and say, no, no, no.
[00:34:05.031 --> 00:34:08.932]  And then pilot waits 20 seconds while it aims just right or chases the person.
[00:34:09.992 --> 00:34:10.773]  Drone pulls up.
[00:34:14.353 --> 00:34:14.814]  Boom.
[00:34:18.014 --> 00:34:21.655]  But see, there's no innovation because the military is so staid.
[00:34:21.675 --> 00:34:23.356]  Not just here, but all over the world.
[00:34:24.324 --> 00:34:28.307]  Except places like China, where it's not, and that is exactly what they're doing.
[00:34:30.088 --> 00:34:32.729]  These drones have to come in at 20 yards away.
[00:34:35.651 --> 00:34:51.121]  When I was 10 years old, I could go ace a skeet obstacle course and hit almost every pigeon, clay pigeon, including the ones that bounce across the ground.
[00:34:52.571 --> 00:34:57.452]  But again, half a million dead Russians, half a million dead, estimated, or more Ukrainians.
[00:34:58.272 --> 00:35:00.413]  And do you see any shotguns on either side?
[00:35:01.613 --> 00:35:11.795]  No, they put up chicken wire around the tanks, hoping the drone doesn't get through the chicken wire and explodes three feet from the tank so it doesn't get through its hull.
[00:35:13.475 --> 00:35:20.817]  And I only bring up just simple, out-of-the-box, back-of-the-envelope things to deal with this for all the sides.
[00:35:24.813 --> 00:35:25.934]  That's not where this is going.
[00:35:27.354 --> 00:35:34.357]  But an engineer, a firearms engineer, in a day, in a week, can create something spectacular.
[00:35:36.278 --> 00:35:49.885]  To create a foot and a half long tube that's got a magazine that holds 3 to 4, 12 gauge, with birdshot, or a little bit heavier, maybe 5 shot, 4 shot.
[00:35:54.661 --> 00:35:58.099]   And then, because the drone has to be ultralight, it has no armor.
[00:35:58.099 --> 00:36:04.010]   And then all you do is flip down a handle at the back, flip down a little handle slit at the front that's built
[00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:09.141]   into the tube, punch a button on the front, or maybe it's already built in,
[00:36:09.141 --> 00:36:13.941]  little sight pops up, drone's coming in.
[00:36:20.981 --> 00:36:25.221]   Just think about, the globalists seem like they're smart because they've had decades
[00:36:25.221 --> 00:36:29.621]   to get ready and roll out their systems, but notice how slowly they innovate.
[00:36:29.815 --> 00:36:33.138]  Notice how they can't, notice the Russians can't, the Ukrainians can't, the U.S.
[00:36:33.158 --> 00:36:37.280]  can't, nobody can, except the JICOMs and the Israelis.
[00:36:38.381 --> 00:36:42.364]  They are really innovating in all these ways every day.
[00:36:42.384 --> 00:36:57.990]   And you know, the answer would have a global peace deal and national sovereignty, but a real ...global system where people are transparent and open and there's sovereignty, but we agree to stop all this, to stop the gain-of-function bioweapons, to stop the nuclear weapons, but... the genie's out of the bottle.
[00:36:59.192 --> 00:37:00.614]  Pandora's box is open.
[00:37:01.335 --> 00:37:03.599]  The barn door was left open, the cows ain't coming home.
[00:37:04.815 --> 00:37:12.881]  And so now this is the world we're being set up in, where they're artificially shutting down the human systems and forcing the robot takeover.
[00:37:13.202 --> 00:37:17.145]  And the robot takeover is not to empower us, it's to end humans.
[00:37:17.605 --> 00:37:21.208]  What did he say two weeks ago at the Deimos Group World Economic Forum?
[00:37:21.768 --> 00:37:25.051]  Larry Fink, the head of BlackRock, 80 plus percent of world assets under his control.
[00:37:26.191 --> 00:37:31.287]   He said, Well, the best societies aren't human.
[00:37:31.948 --> 00:37:34.748]  The best societies are depopulating and replacing humans with robots.
[00:37:35.028 --> 00:37:35.488]  That's a quote.
[00:37:37.529 --> 00:37:38.169]  I basically nailed it.
[00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:39.089]  That's the quote.
[00:37:39.409 --> 00:37:40.089]  Want to play it again for it?
[00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:48.051]  So, why are we doing this?
[00:37:48.651 --> 00:37:51.272]  Why are we making ourselves obsolete?
[00:37:51.472 --> 00:37:53.232]  Humans control our environment, or try to.
[00:37:54.032 --> 00:37:55.313]  Why is the establishment doing it?
[00:37:55.333 --> 00:38:07.260]   Well, as I mentioned in the last segment, The good news is there are a lot of people now in government and corporations and private life that are very successful, very talented, very wealthy, very smart.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.603]  It's a whole gambit who are like, yeah, this is really bad.
[00:38:10.643 --> 00:38:11.824]  They can see the end game.
[00:38:12.124 --> 00:38:17.308]  They saw none of globalism was world peace and innovation and life extension and kumbaya, but now they go late.
[00:38:17.369 --> 00:38:17.769]  It's not.
[00:38:17.849 --> 00:38:18.970]  It's the end of humans.
[00:38:20.792 --> 00:38:31.390]   And so whether you're Elon Musk or any of these guys that I've talked to or met with, 100% they're for real on our side.
[00:38:32.771 --> 00:38:37.132]  Because, like Naomi Wolf said, they realize this is a system that's going to destroy them and their children as well.
[00:38:37.692 --> 00:38:39.493]  Elon Musk has, what does he have, 10, 11 children?
[00:38:39.533 --> 00:38:40.673]  I forget, he's having new ones all the time.
[00:38:41.153 --> 00:38:42.253]  So that's the greatest wealth there is.
[00:38:42.293 --> 00:38:42.674]  He's right.
[00:38:42.814 --> 00:38:44.134]  That's the greatest assets of the future.
[00:38:45.314 --> 00:38:47.855]  But if you look at Macron and all the other people, they don't have children.
[00:38:50.831 --> 00:38:52.252]  Because they've given up on humanity.
[00:38:52.272 --> 00:38:54.273]  They've sold out to this anti-human force.
[00:38:54.994 --> 00:38:57.315]  So, I'm really frustrated.
[00:38:57.836 --> 00:39:09.523]  I'm very excited about the Great Awakening and good things are happening, but I'm also still frustrated because no one should be going along with this, including some of the most powerful families that want life extension and believe they're going to end up coming out on top of this.
[00:39:09.363 --> 00:39:12.923]   this because you can look at where this is going and how violent this is going to be
[00:39:12.923 --> 00:39:16.363]   and how out of control this is going to be, cutting off resources and turning loose the
[00:39:16.363 --> 00:39:25.922]   robots against the people, that it will end in the destruction of the surface of the earth.
[00:39:25.922 --> 00:39:35.923]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:39:29.044 --> 00:39:42.970]  And then there'll be strategic elites that are left that are always obsessed with power and then they're going to rally and then try to go to each sector and dig out of the holes the other elites that are alive.
[00:39:45.077 --> 00:39:46.357]  Still, and eradicate them.
[00:39:46.377 --> 00:39:49.238]  I mean, this is getting rid of chivalry to the next level.
[00:39:49.658 --> 00:39:55.000]  This is pushing the world into a conquest system.
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:56.540]  Is conquestionable?
[00:39:57.020 --> 00:40:00.161]  Is that even a word?
[00:40:00.181 --> 00:40:02.962]  It's a conquest system.
[00:40:04.437 --> 00:40:10.342]  That is so anti-human that we know it's being directed by an anti-human force.
[00:40:10.862 --> 00:40:23.091]  Anyone that's a true intellectual and actually studies it all, looks at it and goes, why would the entire establishment implement and do something that is guaranteed to destroy them?
[00:40:26.114 --> 00:40:29.236]  No, it's an outside human force manipulating and controlling all this.
[00:40:29.296 --> 00:40:31.138]  And you can say, well, is it AI?
[00:40:33.322 --> 00:40:39.442]   AI is an expression of this force, one to remove humans from the decision-making process
[00:40:39.442 --> 00:40:40.521]  of free will.
[00:40:40.521 --> 00:40:51.122]   So, I'm gonna give the toll-free number out, and I wanna talk about
[00:40:51.122 --> 00:40:57.922]   the global government takeover, the New World Order, what they're gonna do next, how we stop 'em,
[00:40:57.922 --> 00:41:03.570]   what you make of The fact we're already under UN occupation in almost every town and city in the Western world.
[00:41:03.931 --> 00:41:04.871]  We just aired earlier.
[00:41:04.891 --> 00:41:10.815]  And the military age men brigades are pouring in.
[00:41:12.478 --> 00:41:12.938]  Under U.N.
[00:41:12.958 --> 00:41:15.540]  command and control, it's in the news that they're got U.N.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:16.481]  phones, they're under U.N.
[00:41:16.521 --> 00:41:18.042]  control, they're under N.G.O.
[00:41:18.082 --> 00:41:21.984]  command, and they are military-age men, and they do have the same boots and the same backpacks.
[00:41:22.204 --> 00:41:23.105]  You can see their bearing.
[00:41:23.365 --> 00:41:26.147]  They're not guys that just got in the military two years ago.
[00:41:26.527 --> 00:41:27.288]  They're all about 30, 35.
[00:41:28.328 --> 00:41:30.129]  They're all junior officers.
[00:41:33.292 --> 00:41:37.154]  And they've got the wary look of somebody that's been in combat.
[00:41:38.575 --> 00:41:39.976]  They've got the thousand-yard stare.
[00:41:44.221 --> 00:41:45.962]  Something really bad's about to go down.
[00:41:47.503 --> 00:41:51.785]  And I just wanna have a real sense of urgency with you because every show could be our last.
[00:41:53.706 --> 00:41:55.787]  And I want you to understand it's time to get right with God.
[00:41:56.287 --> 00:41:58.708]  And I'm telling myself that when I lecture you, I'm lecturing myself.
[00:41:58.968 --> 00:41:59.949]  Let's be 100% clear.
[00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:06.512]  I called my wife this morning and I said, listen, we got three years of supply of storable food in the attic.
[00:42:07.933 --> 00:42:09.214]  I said, we gotta take care of everybody else.
[00:42:09.274 --> 00:42:10.194]  I said, that's not enough.
[00:42:11.495 --> 00:42:22.544]   And I said, get more storable food and also go out And get a whole bunch of other canned and glass goods, pickled stuff, and get as much as you can.
[00:42:22.564 --> 00:42:24.485]  And she said, how much?
[00:42:24.505 --> 00:42:28.728]  And I said, just start going out every couple of days and buying a grocery thing full of it.
[00:42:28.748 --> 00:42:31.569]  She's like, well, where do we put it?
[00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:33.471]  And I said, put it in the garage.
[00:42:34.371 --> 00:42:39.294]  But I just know at an instinctive level, that needs to be done.
[00:42:39.314 --> 00:42:41.876]  Look, I'm not even trying to sell you storable food at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:42:42.276 --> 00:42:43.537]  I just promote what I'm already doing.
[00:42:44.953 --> 00:42:46.555]  And yeah, we got great food.
[00:42:46.595 --> 00:42:47.175]  It's low price.
[00:42:47.215 --> 00:42:47.676]  It's quality.
[00:42:47.696 --> 00:42:48.576]  I got three years of it.
[00:42:49.857 --> 00:42:53.280]  And there's, I bought for the crew during the lockdowns.
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.641]  I knew they might keep them going forever.
[00:42:54.742 --> 00:42:59.245]  We put up with it a couple of years supply for like a person, maybe a month supply for the crew.
[00:43:00.026 --> 00:43:03.789]  When the power was out, you know, and they cut the power off and wouldn't let the generators turn on.
[00:43:03.809 --> 00:43:06.512]  They shut down the coal power plants up two years ago.
[00:43:06.952 --> 00:43:08.093]  We had no power for two weeks.
[00:43:08.113 --> 00:43:11.156]  We had generators and we sat around the office and actually ate lunch.
[00:43:11.909 --> 00:43:13.991]  Dinner, you know, off that, some of that food.
[00:43:14.631 --> 00:43:17.654]  But I'm just telling you, there's no silver bullet to this.
[00:43:19.876 --> 00:43:22.938]  It's like they say in Wizard of Oz, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:43:24.599 --> 00:43:28.283]  So, and I'm gonna be honest with you, I'm mourning right now.
[00:43:28.623 --> 00:43:29.704]  I'm very sad.
[00:43:29.724 --> 00:43:30.785]  I'm very upset.
[00:43:31.285 --> 00:43:32.066]  I'm not scared.
[00:43:33.887 --> 00:43:35.769]  I'm frustrated that I haven't done enough.
[00:43:37.177 --> 00:43:40.159]  And I'm very, very sad that Satan has this much influence.
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:49.865]  And I just want you to know that... It's like the doctor came in three weeks ago, and they scanned my wife's dad.
[00:43:49.905 --> 00:43:50.626]  He's a great guy.
[00:43:50.986 --> 00:43:51.286]  Love him.
[00:43:51.446 --> 00:43:52.267]  Funny guy.
[00:43:52.287 --> 00:43:55.869]  My wife said, do you mind if my dad, who's so sick, moves in with us eight months ago?
[00:43:55.909 --> 00:43:56.590]  I said, I love your dad.
[00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:57.890]  Love playing poker with him.
[00:43:58.111 --> 00:44:04.875]  He cooks great steaks and dinner, and great Italian food, and great breakfast, and we play poker and pool.
[00:44:04.895 --> 00:44:05.816]  My God, he's like my buddy.
[00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:11.772]  Uh, and, uh, three weeks ago, you know, he couldn't breathe and he had heart problems.
[00:44:11.792 --> 00:44:15.373]  He goes in, they scan him, they come back the next day, and they go, yeah, he's got cancer in all his bones.
[00:44:15.393 --> 00:44:16.373]  I can't believe he's walking around.
[00:44:16.654 --> 00:44:18.514]  Bone cancer everywhere, just all over him.
[00:44:18.954 --> 00:44:20.075]  It's already cracking the bones.
[00:44:20.595 --> 00:44:22.035]  That's how tough he was, without even complaining.
[00:44:22.135 --> 00:44:23.416]  Like, one of those is super painful.
[00:44:23.516 --> 00:44:24.636]  It grows and cracks the bone.
[00:44:24.936 --> 00:44:25.797]  Fissures all over him.
[00:44:26.097 --> 00:44:30.238]  Liver cancer, double lung, both upper and lower parts of the lungs.
[00:44:31.139 --> 00:44:34.700]  And the cardiologist says, you should probably just take him home.
[00:44:35.595 --> 00:44:37.016]  Give him some steroids so he's not in pain.
[00:44:37.036 --> 00:44:44.219]  But then the other doctors got involved, the cancer doctors, oncologists, and all the rest.
[00:44:44.299 --> 00:44:50.382]  I told my wife, I said, you give him that first chemotherapy, he's gonna pass out, go into a coma, he'll be dead in a couple weeks.
[00:44:51.362 --> 00:44:53.083]  And the day he died, I said, he'll die tonight.
[00:44:53.463 --> 00:44:54.904]  I looked at him that morning, I said, he'll be dead.
[00:44:54.964 --> 00:44:55.744]  He'll be dead tonight.
[00:44:55.844 --> 00:44:56.825]  He died about 6 p.m.
[00:44:57.745 --> 00:44:59.146]  And it's not that I just know this stuff.
[00:44:59.386 --> 00:45:10.319]   And the reason I tell that story is Is that it's like an analogy for life and what the system is.
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:17.106]  Because even though the cardiologist that had been his cardiologist, we've been down there for eight months, came in and was a great guy and said, he's taking him home.
[00:45:17.647 --> 00:45:20.029]  The rest of the hospital came in and said, no, no, we need to do this.
[00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:22.312]  So it's like, she goes, oh, well, he goes, well, I want to do it then.
[00:45:22.812 --> 00:45:25.755]  I said, okay, we'll say bye to your dad because you won't be, you'll never talk to him again.
[00:45:25.775 --> 00:45:26.176]  He's never dead.
[00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:29.232]  And what's frustrating is I know this stuff.
[00:45:29.292 --> 00:45:35.177]  I've seen it with humans and with two of my dogs that never regained consciousness and died right after they got their first chemo.
[00:45:36.178 --> 00:45:41.703]  I know some people, you know, do okay on it because they were already pretty robust, but when somebody's really sick and on the edge, it kills you.
[00:45:43.225 --> 00:45:45.867]  But this is the reason I'm telling the story.
[00:45:45.887 --> 00:45:47.889]  I remember now, because I start telling the story and I go right back to it.
[00:45:47.909 --> 00:45:49.951]  I'm telling it as it happens, then I forget why was I telling it.
[00:45:51.072 --> 00:45:52.874]  Dr. Allen loves to money my wife.
[00:45:53.865 --> 00:45:59.927]  He's only been in the hospital a few days and the scan had come back and he said, he said, yeah, he's not going to make it.
[00:45:59.967 --> 00:46:02.048]  He may live a few months, but we might just take him home.
[00:46:02.068 --> 00:46:03.609]  Other than that, he's going to save him.
[00:46:04.049 --> 00:46:04.709]  That's my opinion.
[00:46:04.729 --> 00:46:07.250]  But I said, no, we hear he goes, his lungs are gone.
[00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:08.010]  Liver's gone.
[00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.871]  It's just giant tumors.
[00:46:09.631 --> 00:46:11.251]  And he said, I want to apologize to you.
[00:46:12.552 --> 00:46:14.413]  And I looked at him and I said, why apologize?
[00:46:14.433 --> 00:46:15.073]  It's not your fault.
[00:46:15.093 --> 00:46:15.613]  You've been honest.
[00:46:16.453 --> 00:46:17.774]  He goes, I just, I just apologize.
[00:46:19.639 --> 00:46:23.641]  Now the others came in and said, oh we can save him, it's fine, let's do all these surgeries and all this stuff.
[00:46:23.681 --> 00:46:25.062]  And I said, they're about to Darth Vader your dad.
[00:46:25.683 --> 00:46:28.024]  And they did it, and that's fine, nobody's bad, I don't judge anybody.
[00:46:28.684 --> 00:46:32.927]  It's just that's like the tenth time I've seen this, and maybe in some other cases it'll be different.
[00:46:33.868 --> 00:46:38.270]  But I do feel like I should apologize.
[00:46:39.151 --> 00:46:43.954]  Even though that doctor didn't do anything wrong and gave us good advice, he apologized because he felt bad that he couldn't save him.
[00:46:45.023 --> 00:46:47.525]  And that's how I want to apologize to everybody.
[00:46:47.545 --> 00:46:48.465]  And I mean that.
[00:46:48.485 --> 00:46:51.988]  I want to apologize I didn't do more back when we could probably could have stopped this.
[00:46:52.468 --> 00:46:54.269]  I want to apologize I wasn't more focused.
[00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:57.592]  I want to apologize I wasn't more dedicated.
[00:46:57.612 --> 00:46:59.293]  I want to apologize I wasn't more urgent.
[00:47:00.534 --> 00:47:02.635]  But I only say that to be honest with you.
[00:47:03.095 --> 00:47:05.037]  When I point a finger at you there's three more back at me.
[00:47:05.897 --> 00:47:07.478]  You need to apologize to yourself.
[00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:10.721]  You need to apologize to your family.
[00:47:12.682 --> 00:47:13.963]  Because we're not getting out of this now.
[00:47:15.222 --> 00:47:30.368]  I did everything I could to stop this, and now I've got to give you the bad news, and I've got to give my family the bad news, and I've given my wife the bad news, that we're going to be chewed up by the new world order now.
[00:47:31.649 --> 00:47:33.409]  Now what matters is your relationship with God.
[00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:38.591]  What matters is, is that you prepare spiritually for this, and physically.
[00:47:39.312 --> 00:47:40.612]  And the evidence is overwhelming.
[00:47:40.652 --> 00:47:41.833]  They'll be destroyed in the process.
[00:47:41.873 --> 00:47:42.753]  They will be defeated as well.
[00:47:43.033 --> 00:47:43.994]  They're Satan's pimps.
[00:47:44.114 --> 00:47:44.714]  Of course they will.
[00:47:45.791 --> 00:47:48.052]  It doesn't lessen the fact of how horrible this is.
[00:47:48.713 --> 00:47:53.495]  And I apologize for having to give you this bad news.
[00:47:54.436 --> 00:47:56.577]  But I don't think you even need me to tell you, do you?
[00:47:58.238 --> 00:48:00.939]  Show, good times are over.
[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:04.721]  It's like that song from The Doors.
[00:48:05.742 --> 00:48:10.204]  It's all over for the unknown soldier.
[00:48:11.785 --> 00:48:13.306]  The war is over.
[00:48:14.821 --> 00:48:16.462]  For the unknown soldier.
[00:48:19.063 --> 00:48:28.586]  But, understand, if they bring in martial law and they win this war, they are gonna take your children from you if you survive.
[00:48:28.927 --> 00:48:34.909]  They're gonna mutilate them, and torture them with drugs, and cut their breasts and genitals off, because they're Hellraiser cult leaders.
[00:48:35.929 --> 00:48:38.350]  Imagine there was a cult running around that grabbed kids and cut their genitals off.
[00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:39.651]  You're like, ah, they're the worst cult ever!
[00:48:39.931 --> 00:48:40.451]  Worse than MS-13!
[00:48:40.471 --> 00:48:42.652]  But it's the government that's like, oh, it's liberal!
[00:48:47.105 --> 00:48:51.128]  So, now let's do what it takes to stop this.
[00:48:52.810 --> 00:48:54.951]  Let's not comply with anything the system says.
[00:48:55.592 --> 00:48:56.733]  The social contract's broken.
[00:48:57.433 --> 00:48:59.415]  Let's warn everybody 24-7.
[00:48:59.675 --> 00:49:01.717]  Let's physically get ready and spiritually get ready.
[00:49:02.297 --> 00:49:04.279]  And let's expose their operations on every front.
[00:49:05.205 --> 00:49:09.207]  And ask God, not what you want, this is my opinion, you can take it or leave it.
[00:49:09.907 --> 00:49:18.551]  I don't ask God in prayers, except occasionally, maybe one out of a hundred prayers, I'll say, and please protect my children, that's your plan, that's your will, but whatever happens, I understand.
[00:49:19.011 --> 00:49:20.932]  I just ask God, will you please give me discernment?
[00:49:21.552 --> 00:49:23.113]  I am a weak, broken creature.
[00:49:23.213 --> 00:49:23.693]  I am a sinner.
[00:49:23.993 --> 00:49:34.630]   Can you please, I have free will, but I ask you to come into me, and I ask you to lead God and direct me, and I ask you, To sanctify me and help me be a good person.
[00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:35.971]  Of course, God still says that's up to you.
[00:49:35.991 --> 00:49:36.671]  You have free will.
[00:49:37.191 --> 00:49:38.832]  But I will give you the discernment.
[00:49:38.972 --> 00:49:41.014]  I will give you the path if you want to follow it.
[00:49:41.474 --> 00:49:43.796]  God shows the way like a light.
[00:49:45.237 --> 00:49:46.417]  You have to follow the path.
[00:49:47.098 --> 00:49:50.520]  And the path is very rough.
[00:49:51.321 --> 00:49:53.942]  But when you get through it, you realize it was the only path through.
[00:49:53.962 --> 00:50:04.587]   So, There are a lot of people who want to bargain with the system, they want to bargain with the New World Order, they want to bargain with the culture, they want to play all sides, they want to be friends with everybody.
[00:50:05.187 --> 00:50:06.607]  That way leads to total destruction.
[00:50:07.988 --> 00:50:16.670]  The path through this to victory is hard, and painful, and brutal, and you'll feel like you're outnumbered, you'll feel like you're losing, but in the end, you win.
[00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:20.891]  I'm going to tell you right now, you're right with Jesus, folks.
[00:50:21.712 --> 00:50:22.692]  Because this is the big one.
[00:50:24.212 --> 00:50:32.737]  You're gonna, like I said five years ago, or two years ago, or six months ago, we're all gonna look back at right now, and you can already see, we look back at a year ago, it was great, or five years ago, it was wonderful.
[00:50:33.878 --> 00:50:41.282]  We're gonna look back on this time, and think of it as the good old days.
[00:50:45.684 --> 00:50:53.349]  I saw a comment on X today, that was a point I meant to make, and I've made a few times, but not properly, that really said everything.
[00:50:55.598 --> 00:50:56.619]  Let me just pull it up right now.
[00:50:56.679 --> 00:50:59.581]  Senator Scott, I think he printed it off, but I gotta find it.
[00:51:01.342 --> 00:51:02.182]  And it says it all.
[00:51:02.202 --> 00:51:06.946]  Let me find it.
[00:51:08.887 --> 00:51:13.370]  With all the police defunding and the lawlessness, we're in the elite's version of the purge.
[00:51:15.331 --> 00:51:16.372]  I'm gonna read that again when we come back.
[00:51:16.872 --> 00:51:19.014]  Yeah, you see those movies, it's all they're gonna do.
[00:51:19.654 --> 00:51:23.457]  It's not a grassroots purge, it's the globalists waging war against good people.
[00:51:24.777 --> 00:51:25.338]  Disgusting.
[00:51:27.165 --> 00:51:28.025]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[00:51:28.125 --> 00:51:34.949]  I want to take your calls on the huge issue of the world government, new world orders here, the exterminations we're already deep in it.
[00:51:35.449 --> 00:51:36.329]  What do you think about it?
[00:51:36.389 --> 00:51:37.510]  Where are we going to go from here?
[00:51:37.590 --> 00:51:38.790]  What do we do to try to stop it?
[00:51:38.810 --> 00:51:39.591]  877-789-2539.
[00:51:39.611 --> 00:51:40.591]  877-789-2539 on this live Tuesday edition.
[00:51:40.411 --> 00:51:50.411]  789-2539, 877-789-2539 on this live Tuesday edition.
[00:51:50.411 --> 00:51:57.411]  877-789-2539. In the interim, please support the broadcast.
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:51:58.861]  We got the stuff in stock.
[00:51:58.901 --> 00:52:00.182]  Anything you order is going to get to you.
[00:52:00.522 --> 00:52:01.583]  They shut InfoWars down.
[00:52:01.603 --> 00:52:05.025]  It'll be a few months after they announce it until it gets shut down.
[00:52:05.046 --> 00:52:07.087]  They may just kick me out right away and turn the show off.
[00:52:07.447 --> 00:52:08.769]  Under law, anything you order, you'll get.
[00:52:09.369 --> 00:52:13.492]  Could be your last chance to get an InfoWars t-shirt, a book, a film, a nitric boost, you name it.
[00:52:13.552 --> 00:52:14.313]  Great crew here.
[00:52:14.673 --> 00:52:16.935]  Maybe some deal gets made, but who knows?
[00:52:17.596 --> 00:52:20.138]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:52:21.636 --> 00:52:30.319]  And don't forget drjonesnaturals.com that's separate from this and we'll continue on and all the great products that are there at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:52:31.059 --> 00:52:32.560]  I'm going to tell you what's on my mind.
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:41.923]  The only thing un-American I'm hearing is the constant parade of attacks by your foul-mouthed, flea-bitten listeners against our noble president.
[00:52:42.623 --> 00:52:46.365]  I am a Biden believer and here's what's going to go down in 24.
[00:52:47.685 --> 00:52:53.412]  Biden's going to walk away again, wiping the floor with Trump like he did in 2020.
[00:52:53.692 --> 00:52:56.155]  Because America believes in Biden.
[00:52:56.475 --> 00:52:58.978]  Hollywood believes in Biden, like Mark Hamill.
[00:52:59.399 --> 00:53:04.605]  And we all know that Trump is going to try to cheat, but he's going to go down in flames.
[00:53:04.665 --> 00:53:10.810]   And all I hear is the anger and the bitter and your alcoholic listeners I want to talk right to your listeners right now.
[00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:14.110]  with the end of white cisgender Christian America.
[00:53:14.110 --> 00:53:22.630]   As we rise, rise, the pink haired warriors, the non-binary warriors, the transgenders, we're rising,
[00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:24.869]  and we're gonna sweep you aside.
[00:53:24.869 --> 00:53:26.869]  I wanna talk right to your listeners right now.
[00:53:26.869 --> 00:53:31.430]   The frightened middle-aged white man, clinging to his guns and his religion
[00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:33.829]  and his money and his privilege.
[00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:39.710]   Get ready, baby, because pretty soon you will be swept aside in the new order of things.
[00:53:39.796 --> 00:53:41.196]  And you know what that new order is?
[00:53:41.636 --> 00:53:47.158]  It's going to be a beautiful, wonderful utopia where we all come together and live together.
[00:53:47.458 --> 00:53:49.519]  And yes, there will be communism.
[00:53:49.819 --> 00:53:54.719]   Yes, there will We'll be Sharia law because you don't understand queers for
[00:53:54.719 --> 00:53:57.519]   Palestine together, forever strong.
[00:53:57.519 --> 00:54:03.998]   We are coming together in a coalition, one big, great big coalition that will
[00:54:03.998 --> 00:54:05.039]  win a day.
[00:54:05.039 --> 00:54:11.798]   And in 2024, when you're all crying, when you're all just so broken up because
[00:54:11.798 --> 00:54:13.118]  you're lost again.
[00:54:13.455 --> 00:54:23.802]  It's a new dawn in America with a rainbow, a transgender rainbow sweeping across the land to sweep you aside into obscurity.
[00:54:23.822 --> 00:54:29.245]  The time of the white cisgendered man is over.
[00:54:29.926 --> 00:54:32.628]  Your privilege card has been revoked.
[00:54:33.408 --> 00:54:37.810]  You will accept the new refugees, the new Americans.
[00:54:38.250 --> 00:54:39.351]  And here's the secret.
[00:54:39.631 --> 00:54:40.612]  We're in charge.
[00:54:40.852 --> 00:54:42.352]  We tell you what to do.
[00:54:42.712 --> 00:54:43.673]  So get ready.
[00:54:43.993 --> 00:54:51.417]  Get ready to give up your guns, give up your gold, give up your privilege, and accept the way things are now.
[00:54:51.757 --> 00:54:55.819]  The pink-haired warriors are here, and we're not going anywhere.
[00:54:55.919 --> 00:54:58.500]  You will not legislate us out of existence.
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:01.761]  You will not put us back in the closet and we will not be quiet.
[00:55:02.101 --> 00:55:06.162]  Free, free from your oppressive grip that you've had on us.
[00:55:06.222 --> 00:55:08.282]  And tell you what, I'm a Biden believer.
[00:55:08.822 --> 00:55:11.203]  When Biden smiles, the sun shines.
[00:55:11.503 --> 00:55:13.323]  When he weeps, the rain falls.
[00:55:13.683 --> 00:55:18.524]  His strong hands lift up the oppressed and his foot stomps on the white supremacists.
[00:55:19.104 --> 00:55:21.305]  So this is how it's going to go down in 24.
[00:55:21.945 --> 00:55:26.326]  Joe Biden's going to be back for four more years and then Kamala Harris for eight.
[00:55:26.926 --> 00:55:29.726]  and then gather news from you. What do you think about that?
[00:55:29.726 --> 00:55:34.685]   All right now in our number two we're talking about what are the globals going to do next in
[00:55:34.685 --> 00:55:40.525]   this crazy depopulation new world order operation. It's a huge subject there's a thousand a trillion
[00:55:40.525 --> 00:55:43.965]   angles to it. So we're going to start going to your phone calls right now. I got a bunch of
[00:55:43.965 --> 00:55:48.285]   news I'm going to intersperse. Let's talk to Nathan Combat Vet Military Intelligence on the
[00:55:48.285 --> 00:55:51.246]  New World Order. How do you see what's happening right now?
[00:55:51.246 --> 00:55:56.326]   Alex I just first want to say thank Thank you for everything.
[00:55:56.447 --> 00:56:11.960]  Your show has been such a critical lifeline for me as a combat vet doing military intelligence to be able to continue to have a source of intel that I can trust and is reliable.
[00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:13.862]  Thank you so much for everything you've done.
[00:56:13.902 --> 00:56:18.826]  If I shut you down today, you've made such a huge impact on my life and I know on everybody out there.
[00:56:19.667 --> 00:56:20.667]  Thank you, I appreciate that.
[00:56:20.687 --> 00:56:21.028]  I'm Fred.
[00:56:22.074 --> 00:56:28.078]  I really appreciate you, and I love you both, and maybe one of these days we'll have a chance to sit down and talk face-to-face, God willing.
[00:56:28.458 --> 00:56:49.193]   But I really think that we need to be able to convert some of the ones who are going along with this New World Order, and we do so because I know a lot of them are scared, but we create an environment That is welcoming to them.
[00:56:49.313 --> 00:56:52.938]  That they don't have to be afraid to say, you know what, I'm going to stand up.
[00:56:52.978 --> 00:56:57.083]  Because if they're afraid of losing their job, we create an environment like Tucker Carlson.
[00:56:57.103 --> 00:56:59.927]  I totally hear what you're saying, but they better be afraid of it winning.
[00:57:00.227 --> 00:57:01.889]  They're going to have to lose something to stop this.
[00:57:01.929 --> 00:57:04.273]  They will lose everything if they don't come out against this.
[00:57:04.929 --> 00:57:05.430]  They've got it.
[00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:07.973]  Yeah, they definitely have to realize they've got skin in the game.
[00:57:07.993 --> 00:57:09.855]  A lot of them won't convert.
[00:57:09.895 --> 00:57:13.619]  They're just mentally ill and they want to go along with self-destruction.
[00:57:13.639 --> 00:57:20.467]  You know, that's something that they're going to have to fight that battle and overcome that devilish thing that's got them.
[00:57:21.228 --> 00:57:23.711]  And we pray for those who are lost.
[00:57:24.269 --> 00:57:30.972]  That God would spark that little bit of light inside them so that they'd be convicted of what they're doing and would make that turn.
[00:57:31.012 --> 00:57:34.013]  That's really what's going to help turn this ship around.
[00:57:34.033 --> 00:57:41.936]  But we've got to create that environment of love and being willing to suffer what they put upon us because that's just a key.
[00:57:43.097 --> 00:57:51.220]  We have a tendency to want to respond out of hatred or out of anger or out of pain to respond to what they've done to us, but that's not what we're supposed to do.
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:52.761]  That's not how we win them over.
[00:57:53.141 --> 00:57:59.104]  We win them over by allowing them to hurt us, but we always are listening to God.
[00:57:59.164 --> 00:57:59.964]  That's the key.
[00:58:00.204 --> 00:58:06.007]  When God speaks and says, do this or don't let them do that, God will speak to you.
[00:58:06.047 --> 00:58:08.828]  There's a time when God will speak and say, don't let them harm the body.
[00:58:09.789 --> 00:58:14.857]   But otherwise, We wait on God, and we allow them to do what they need to do.
[00:58:14.957 --> 00:58:27.715]  I know that's hard, and I know that's contrary to everything we're talking about, but I'm telling you, there's a spiritual element where God will step in, and God will take care of this, if the righteous only do what He'd have us to do, when He would have us to do it.
[00:58:28.621 --> 00:58:29.201]  No, you're right.
[00:58:29.262 --> 00:58:31.863]  That's why there's a time to live, a time to die, a time to reap, a time to sow.
[00:58:31.924 --> 00:58:33.565]  It's absolutely all God's time.
[00:58:33.585 --> 00:58:35.706]  It's like Christ and what Christ did.
[00:58:35.926 --> 00:58:39.229]  And at the same time, we have to oppose them in the information war.
[00:58:39.889 --> 00:58:43.052]  And we have to, you know, just realize, though, that this is a total takeover.
[00:58:43.092 --> 00:58:44.213]  I mean, this is satanic.
[00:58:44.833 --> 00:58:46.054]  This whole thing is evil.
[00:58:46.515 --> 00:58:48.817]  This whole thing goes right out of the devil's workshop.
[00:58:49.578 --> 00:58:57.005]  And to me, it's just wild to be alive in 2024 when the New World Order is in full attack mode.
[00:58:57.105 --> 00:59:00.288]  I mean, wow, were the old timers right, Nathan?
[00:59:00.408 --> 00:59:01.569]  I mean, man, were they right?
[00:59:01.609 --> 00:59:04.792]  Those old timers were incredible people.
[00:59:05.925 --> 00:59:08.826]  They really are, and just keep speaking the truth.
[00:59:08.946 --> 00:59:13.447]  And really, with all this space weather and stuff, there's something more going on.
[00:59:13.487 --> 00:59:15.747]  There's a reason why the elitists are building bunkers.
[00:59:15.767 --> 00:59:17.608]  There's a reason why they're doing these things.
[00:59:18.108 --> 00:59:21.589]  And they think they're doing what's right, even if it's against humanity.
[00:59:21.969 --> 00:59:25.269]  But they need to realize that that's not the way.
[00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:28.450]  Well, why wouldn't they rally humanity to be honest?
[00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:31.531]  If you're honest, humanity can do anything, because they're satanic.
[00:59:32.522 --> 00:59:32.902]  I agree.
[00:59:32.922 --> 00:59:41.364]  I think there's so much potential where we could go off-world and we could colonize these things if we all work together towards that common goal instead of trying to self-destruct.
[00:59:41.664 --> 00:59:44.044]  But again, it comes back to that spiritual element.
[00:59:44.405 --> 00:59:48.205]  They're following an evil spirit, and they've been consumed by it.
[00:59:48.245 --> 00:59:48.845]  They're lost.
[00:59:48.925 --> 00:59:49.726]  They're in the dark.
[00:59:49.806 --> 00:59:52.586]  It's like when you're in the dark, it's like they're blind and they can't see.
[00:59:52.606 --> 00:59:53.806]  No, they are completely lost.
[00:59:53.846 --> 00:59:54.887]  They are absolutely lost.
[00:59:54.947 --> 00:59:55.747]  Thank you so much, sir.
[00:59:55.767 --> 01:00:01.008]  Alright, Brett, Multipass, Kyle, Kristen, Jeff, Carlos, Donovan.
[01:00:02.529 --> 01:00:04.870]  Darlita, Nathaniel, stay with us.
[01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:05.871]  We'll be right back.
[01:00:05.991 --> 01:00:08.273]  Follow me on X at RealAlexJones.
[01:00:09.253 --> 01:00:11.334]  Stories up on InfoWars.com.
[01:00:11.394 --> 01:00:22.321]  The feds are asking to have the court order Steve Bannon to prison for refusing to give up presidential secrets and violate the Constitution on immunity.
[01:00:23.081 --> 01:00:26.884]  DOJ demands Judge order Steve Bannon to begin four-month prison sentence.
[01:00:27.836 --> 01:00:27.996]  Hey Alex.
[01:00:27.816 --> 01:00:31.616]   they're trying to throw Trump in prison right now with all of these incredible
[01:00:31.616 --> 01:00:35.096]   show trials that are blown up their face they don't care because they want to
[01:00:35.096 --> 01:00:42.735]   throw him in prison. Tortado the new world order global government out in the open their entire project of depopulation
[01:00:42.735 --> 01:00:47.006]   dehumanization what are they gonna pull next how do we stop them we're
[01:00:47.006 --> 01:00:55.265]   taking phone calls Brenton FEMA region 9 you're on the air. Hey Alex. Welcome.
[01:00:55.265 --> 01:00:59.056]   So I can tell you exactly what's going to happen in exactly what order.
[01:00:59.384 --> 01:00:59.824]  And guess what?
[01:00:59.844 --> 01:01:05.546]  It ain't coming from me, because God's providing a bit of guidance, I think, to a bunch of people.
[01:01:06.667 --> 01:01:12.229]  And Nuclear 9-11 is the major event.
[01:01:15.310 --> 01:01:15.810]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:01:15.830 --> 01:01:16.190]  You're on air.
[01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:17.231]  Okay.
[01:01:18.264 --> 01:01:19.345]  Nuclear 9-11.
[01:01:19.465 --> 01:01:26.428]  And this is a false flag that will follow the same pattern as, you know, the last, you know, the 9-11 event.
[01:01:27.108 --> 01:01:29.589]  But in conjunction with that, that will occur later this year.
[01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:33.871]  Biden will also die in office at the hands of the deep state.
[01:01:34.711 --> 01:01:36.832]  The election will be canceled.
[01:01:36.912 --> 01:01:40.294]  But even prior to that, Trump will be disqualified from the election.
[01:01:40.314 --> 01:01:41.815]  It has nothing to do with any crimes.
[01:01:42.435 --> 01:01:44.996]  He will be disqualified based on term limits.
[01:01:45.623 --> 01:01:50.948]  Now, we can talk about exactly how that works, it's pretty darn intriguing, but I can tell you exactly how it will work, but I'm going to go on.
[01:01:50.968 --> 01:02:01.416]  So they're saying if he's found to be, if he's found to have actually won the last election, they're claiming then that they'll claim that he can't serve a third term, but I don't think the court's going to rule that, but you're giving your opinion, can you continue?
[01:02:02.337 --> 01:02:09.804]  Yeah, exactly, well I think that'll happen, you know, another deep state, you know, case will be filed off the radar, you know.
[01:02:10.955 --> 01:02:13.701]  Everything that Mike Lindell files, it all gets thrown out, right?
[01:02:13.762 --> 01:02:15.065]  But there'll be a deep state...
[01:02:18.301 --> 01:02:29.288]  Yeah, I've seen that theory.
[01:02:29.348 --> 01:02:35.712]  I disagree with that theory, because the Supreme Court is going to be the arbiter of that, and they're not going to agree if he wasn't given the term.
[01:02:35.732 --> 01:02:37.333]  It doesn't matter if they stole it.
[01:02:37.733 --> 01:02:40.995]  They wouldn't say, well, the people have spoken, so now he serves his second term.
[01:02:41.035 --> 01:02:41.595]  Interesting point.
[01:02:41.615 --> 01:02:42.856]  Thanks for the call.
[01:02:47.782 --> 01:02:49.083]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:02:49.183 --> 01:02:53.986]  Long time listener, first time caller, currently active duty military.
[01:02:54.026 --> 01:02:56.207]  I just wanted to push this out to the listeners.
[01:02:58.389 --> 01:03:02.151]  Throughout my years, we never succeeded alone.
[01:03:02.251 --> 01:03:06.734]  We always had a team to make things work, to reach the goals, to reach the objectives.
[01:03:07.695 --> 01:03:14.147]   For the listeners, if we're not doing this already, we need to start reaching out In our neighborhood.
[01:03:14.167 --> 01:03:14.987]  Start small.
[01:03:15.028 --> 01:03:16.409]  Start talking to your neighbors.
[01:03:16.509 --> 01:03:22.413]  Start developing standard operating procedures for what is probably going to come, you know?
[01:03:22.734 --> 01:03:35.244]  I think this government or, you know, UN, they're going to make us dependent on them and then try to turn us against each other, in my opinion.
[01:03:35.584 --> 01:03:37.426]  And so nobody's going to be safe.
[01:03:37.446 --> 01:03:39.767]  You're going to have to rat out your neighbors at some point.
[01:03:40.088 --> 01:03:45.317]   So start developing the communities now To hopefully weather this storm.
[01:03:47.819 --> 01:03:52.322]  By the way, what you're saying is so important, so elaborate more than I've got comments.
[01:03:53.743 --> 01:04:08.193]  Yeah, so I think they're just going to put a, uh, just whatever tool that they whip out of their box in place to where it's going to be, you know, sort of along the lines of COVID where it was like, or maybe not COVID, but kind of like, if you see something, say something kind of thing.
[01:04:08.213 --> 01:04:09.093]  All right.
[01:04:09.174 --> 01:04:16.533]   So if we have that foundation of security with each other, Within our given area, we can mitigate that.
[01:04:16.973 --> 01:04:19.855]  We can communicate accordingly to sustain.
[01:04:20.235 --> 01:04:20.916]  Does that make sense?
[01:04:22.237 --> 01:04:23.077]  It makes total sense.
[01:04:23.097 --> 01:04:23.477]  Keep going.
[01:04:24.938 --> 01:04:31.142]  So, there's certain SOPs that I have that I just developed with my community.
[01:04:31.562 --> 01:04:32.583]  It just goes in phases.
[01:04:32.643 --> 01:04:37.166]  It doesn't have to be anything militarily or anything, you know, pretty.
[01:04:37.866 --> 01:04:53.062]   You guys just, we need to have a plan If XYZ happens, or if A happens, or B happens, or if C happens, everybody should be on the same page on what to do at that point.
[01:04:53.122 --> 01:04:56.965]  And I know a lot of us know this already, but I'm just here to reinforce it.
[01:04:57.586 --> 01:05:10.176]  And on top of that, with InfoWars, as all of us clean weapons, or stock food, or sharpen knives, we have to preserve our skills and our assets on top of that.
[01:05:11.067 --> 01:05:19.673]  We need to push for InfoWars because InfoWars is not just, it's not a website, it's not for, you know, strictly entertainment.
[01:05:20.113 --> 01:05:24.055]  This will be the weapon with information.
[01:05:24.616 --> 01:05:26.417]  InfoWars is the weapon.
[01:05:26.437 --> 01:05:29.719]  That's kind of like all I got to say on that.
[01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:31.440]  Beautifully said and I appreciate your call, Search.
[01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:32.341]  Let me elaborate on that.
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:40.119]   People who are normal and don't want power tend to just be private and it feels weird
[01:05:40.119 --> 01:05:41.440]  to try to be a leader.
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:44.559]  It feels weird to be in charge or tell people about stuff.
[01:05:44.559 --> 01:05:45.619]  Do you want to stay out of their business?
[01:05:45.619 --> 01:05:48.199]  Well, the globalists are in our business.
[01:05:48.199 --> 01:05:49.199]  They're taking over.
[01:05:49.199 --> 01:05:54.581]   So if you've gone around and maybe put out a flyer in your neighborhood and said,
[01:05:54.581 --> 01:06:00.659]   "Hey, I'm going to have pizza, iced tea or whatever "over here at 7 p.m. for an hour."
[01:06:00.659 --> 01:06:02.601]  We're just talking about community preparedness.
[01:06:02.601 --> 01:06:05.400]  You go, "Hey, they're defunding the police.
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:07.240]  "There's a lot of crime.
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:09.440]  "We should have our own neighborhood watch."
[01:06:09.934 --> 01:06:11.436]  The people that care are going to show up.
[01:06:12.276 --> 01:06:23.246]  And then when just that one little move, as things get more insane, your neighbors are now going to know you and know that you warned about this before it happened.
[01:06:24.967 --> 01:06:27.970]  And then you have the first event and put out 100 flyers, 10 people show up.
[01:06:28.962 --> 01:06:34.345]  It's interesting, you talk about it, maybe you take care of their dog when they're out of town, or they water your plants.
[01:06:35.046 --> 01:06:39.148]  You meet some new friends, you know, you're reaching across the fence, talking to the neighbor, have a barbecue.
[01:06:41.189 --> 01:06:44.791]  And then you talk about, with the people, about, you know, how serious things are.
[01:06:46.312 --> 01:06:46.973]  And what's going on.
[01:06:47.473 --> 01:06:54.157]  So when the globalists try to put out their EAS alerts, try to scare people, you're already ahead of them.
[01:06:55.225 --> 01:06:58.806]  You've got a community that isn't just going to buy in right away.
[01:06:59.246 --> 01:07:01.427]  What's going on understands there's an artificial attack.
[01:07:02.687 --> 01:07:06.988]  And you'll find the people you can really trust, some will be kooks, some will be, you know, it's a mix of people.
[01:07:07.408 --> 01:07:08.888]  But that process is there.
[01:07:09.729 --> 01:07:19.711]  Once the power goes off, or once a nuke goes off in Chicago and they blame Trump or whatever, or there's a power outage, then it's hard to run around and get neighbors to trust you.
[01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:22.745]  But everything is local.
[01:07:22.805 --> 01:07:23.926]  Everything is boots on the ground.
[01:07:24.006 --> 01:07:26.208]  So what he said is absolutely key.
[01:07:26.228 --> 01:07:30.051]  It's what the Green Berets do in any country that they're trying to liberate back when he did that.
[01:07:31.512 --> 01:07:33.674]  And you've got to have that first relationship now.
[01:07:33.694 --> 01:07:34.935]  And that's what we've tried to do here.
[01:07:35.416 --> 01:07:42.342]  So people understand the larger battlescape so that they're ready to prepare and be ready for what's going on locally.
[01:07:43.263 --> 01:07:45.284]  And that's the good news.
[01:07:45.324 --> 01:07:46.325]  I'll just leave it at this.
[01:07:47.846 --> 01:07:51.859]   I've Well, you're a private person, which is great.
[01:07:51.879 --> 01:07:53.280]  You have all the fringe benefits of that.
[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:53.680]  I'm not.
[01:07:55.341 --> 01:08:00.665]  So I've got family, a bunch of family, that have all held on to family land in East Texas.
[01:08:01.846 --> 01:08:04.949]  And so I've got cousins and all, it's just everywhere.
[01:08:05.969 --> 01:08:09.552]  And I go out there and they all know how to skin a buck or run a trot line.
[01:08:09.592 --> 01:08:11.133]  They know how to plant a rifle.
[01:08:11.153 --> 01:08:12.634]  They know how to skin a fish.
[01:08:12.654 --> 01:08:13.695]  They know how to kick some ass.
[01:08:14.796 --> 01:08:18.379]  And I don't even need to go around and proselytize them.
[01:08:19.431 --> 01:08:21.072]  Go to the grocery store, high fives.
[01:08:23.714 --> 01:08:26.516]  Stop on the road, take a picture of a dogwood tree.
[01:08:27.236 --> 01:08:30.498]  One truck drives by, it's an old black man, he's a listener.
[01:08:31.699 --> 01:08:33.520]  They don't know how much we've done on the ground.
[01:08:35.161 --> 01:08:39.844]  And you don't know how much you've done on the ground because no one knows who you are, which is good, but you don't get to see it.
[01:08:39.864 --> 01:08:41.345]  It's like Fight Club.
[01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:44.828]  Tyler Durden's going around, everybody's like, yes sir, we're ready to do the operation.
[01:08:46.449 --> 01:08:48.210]  The enemy has way overplayed their hand.
[01:08:49.318 --> 01:08:55.722]  And that's why you've got to have enough food and you've got to have enough ammunition and know how to use the gun to protect yourself.
[01:08:56.202 --> 01:08:58.423]  But that's defensive and that's secondary.
[01:08:59.524 --> 01:09:09.050]  What the caller was saying is you've got to offensively be in the information war and already be a leader at city council and a leader in your neighborhood.
[01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:15.137]   I mean, maybe you start with Emergency preparedness for tornado hits.
[01:09:15.157 --> 01:09:17.839]  You just get people together and say, what are your concerns?
[01:09:18.119 --> 01:09:20.200]  You're going to find they're already on the same page most of them with you.
[01:09:20.481 --> 01:09:25.484]  Or you're going to find out at these meetings who's the leftist, who's going to go with the enemy.
[01:09:25.884 --> 01:09:28.066]  When that person leaves the meeting, you say, what do you think of that guy?
[01:09:28.086 --> 01:09:28.686]  I don't trust him.
[01:09:28.726 --> 01:09:29.226]  He's pretty bad.
[01:09:29.687 --> 01:09:30.687]  Well, he lives right over there.
[01:09:30.707 --> 01:09:31.888]  Well, we'll just watch out.
[01:09:32.649 --> 01:09:37.612]  So you've already developed the lines of demarcation there.
[01:09:38.763 --> 01:09:39.724]  That's where you are, folks.
[01:09:40.444 --> 01:09:41.124]  That's where you are.
[01:09:41.144 --> 01:09:42.425]  You better start doing it.
[01:09:43.185 --> 01:09:45.446]  I know a lot of you have already done it.
[01:09:45.466 --> 01:09:50.089]  The power of the people together, not just physically, but the moral support.
[01:09:51.129 --> 01:09:57.412]  You know, one guy's going to be a dentist, and one person's going to be an auto mechanic, and one person's going to be a school teacher, and one's going to be a police officer.
[01:09:57.872 --> 01:10:02.255]  You know, one's going to be a... All that knowledge together, we've all got pieces we need.
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:07.602]  Because he said it, the earlier caller, the last caller, they want us dependent.
[01:10:08.082 --> 01:10:09.142]  So don't be dependent.
[01:10:09.643 --> 01:10:10.743]  And don't think you gotta have it all.
[01:10:12.684 --> 01:10:13.944]  But having a doctor that's a neighbor?
[01:10:14.324 --> 01:10:14.925]  That's good.
[01:10:16.445 --> 01:10:17.866]  Having a firearms instructor that's a neighbor?
[01:10:17.986 --> 01:10:18.626]  That's good.
[01:10:19.066 --> 01:10:20.227]  And you know they're living right around you.
[01:10:20.747 --> 01:10:25.429]  And you know that people are sick of Netflix and SportsCenter.
[01:10:25.729 --> 01:10:26.669]  They're ready to get ready.
[01:10:27.169 --> 01:10:28.030]  So that's where we are.
[01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:31.031]  Alright, Kyle in Nebraska, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:10:33.052 --> 01:10:34.954]  Hey, big ol' howdy from Omaha, Nebraska.
[01:10:35.174 --> 01:10:40.400]  Alex, just wanted to say God bless John Wolfe and you and your whole family.
[01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:44.924]  I just wanted to bring up just two quick points.
[01:10:45.665 --> 01:10:47.987]  I believe I talked to Owen last night.
[01:10:48.708 --> 01:10:52.712]  I believe a sheriff's call-in show is long overdue.
[01:10:53.213 --> 01:10:54.274]  I don't know how good it would go.
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:56.761]  But I think that's a great idea.
[01:10:56.781 --> 01:10:59.722]  No, it's great shows to hear from the newly elected sheriffs and their deputies.
[01:11:00.382 --> 01:11:01.843]  Absolutely, that stand in the way of this U.N.
[01:11:01.863 --> 01:11:02.303]  takeover.
[01:11:02.363 --> 01:11:05.745]  And again, law enforcement's not perfect, but it's the best house in a bad neighborhood.
[01:11:06.005 --> 01:11:08.506]  The Globals are very worried about local police.
[01:11:10.867 --> 01:11:25.039]   Absolutely, and I just think, you know, with all the listeners you have and your bigger reach now, I think if you did announce a sheriff-only call-in show, I think y'all would be surprised with With how many people you get to call in?
[01:11:25.059 --> 01:11:27.380]  No, I think we gave it a few days lead time so they learn about it.
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:28.140]  I think it'll be huge.
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:28.801]  No, I agree.
[01:11:29.841 --> 01:11:32.003]  The sheriffs, on average, are amazing.
[01:11:32.043 --> 01:11:32.523]  They get it.
[01:11:33.003 --> 01:11:35.064]  And during a breakdown, they're going to be the real leaders.
[01:11:35.164 --> 01:11:35.725]  I mean, it's a fact.
[01:11:35.785 --> 01:11:40.787]  It's going to be good police and good sheriff's deputies and good sheriffs that are the tip of the spear.
[01:11:40.967 --> 01:11:41.428]  Absolutely.
[01:11:41.967 --> 01:11:45.967]   and all these attorney generals and all these governors. I mean we've got people are really
[01:11:45.967 --> 01:11:50.528]   figuring this out. So again the globalists are in big business. They got Europe, they got Canada,
[01:11:50.528 --> 01:11:54.768]   they got the people are waking up in Canada too. But the point is we're in a really good position
[01:11:54.768 --> 01:11:59.568]   here. People think we're horrible but compared to other countries we're the best. Which I'm not
[01:11:59.568 --> 01:12:06.207]   bragging but best house bad neighborhood. Absolutely and then my second point I just
[01:12:06.207 --> 01:12:11.967]   wanted to bring up there's a really powerful nurse up there in Ontario, Canada.
[01:12:11.603 --> 01:12:12.583]  Her name's Tanya.
[01:12:13.344 --> 01:12:25.832]  She goes by T-Bird T-Money on X. And she's been posting and trying to get some stuff together for the vaccine damage reports and being able to, you know, where to go on a file and stuff.
[01:12:25.872 --> 01:12:30.054]  I think she'd make a great guest for you for any of your shows there.
[01:12:31.095 --> 01:12:32.896]  If there's a way we could reach out to her.
[01:12:32.916 --> 01:12:35.458]  She's very knowledgeable.
[01:12:35.478 --> 01:12:36.939]  She took three Pfizer's.
[01:12:37.677 --> 01:12:42.101]  And she was severely injured and she's fighting right now for her life.
[01:12:43.141 --> 01:12:43.802]  I know she is.
[01:12:43.822 --> 01:12:44.602]  Thank you very much, sir.
[01:12:44.622 --> 01:12:45.123]  We've covered it.
[01:12:45.143 --> 01:12:45.523]  Thank you.
[01:12:46.264 --> 01:12:47.785]  Let's go to Kristen in California.
[01:12:47.805 --> 01:12:48.585]  Kristen, thanks for calling.
[01:12:48.605 --> 01:12:50.447]  Hi, yeah.
[01:12:51.087 --> 01:12:59.754]  My basically thing is here is just how to warn your family successfully because, I mean, I have cattle ranch up in San Diego, California.
[01:12:59.834 --> 01:13:02.596]  I mean, my family's pretty old school, pretty down to earth.
[01:13:04.053 --> 01:13:14.582]  Me and my brother are the crazy ones for, you know, seeing the reality of everything and it's really hard to, it's not like you're trying to warn them because you want to be right.
[01:13:14.702 --> 01:13:19.966]  You don't want to be right in this case, but you want to warn them and have it prepared for, because you love them.
[01:13:20.006 --> 01:13:22.829]  Well, people want the good times to keep rolling and I get it.
[01:13:23.129 --> 01:13:31.196]  The globalists are taking away the good times, folks, but they use the promise of it coming back to get us to sign on to something that gets rid of the good times.
[01:13:32.917 --> 01:13:38.398]  How bad does it have to get for your family and people to realize that it's actually happening?
[01:13:39.898 --> 01:13:41.239]  Well, California is beautiful.
[01:13:41.299 --> 01:13:43.479]  If I had a cattle ranch in California, I've seen those.
[01:13:43.539 --> 01:13:45.099]  I'd be wanting to not believe you either.
[01:13:45.559 --> 01:13:51.220]  I mean, look, people are setting their ways, but plant the seeds now, and if stuff gets worse, they'll remember.
[01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:54.101]  And if you've got to move on to others who are listening, warn people.
[01:13:54.121 --> 01:13:55.181]  If they don't listen, move on.
[01:13:56.241 --> 01:13:56.501]  Yeah.
[01:13:56.941 --> 01:13:58.361]  Because it's a disrespect thing.
[01:13:58.882 --> 01:14:00.982]  They think, hey, what are you trying to tell me what's going on?
[01:14:02.822 --> 01:14:08.705]  Yeah, well they said, I mean like my dad, you need to stop listening to that stuff and just go to work.
[01:14:08.765 --> 01:14:14.308]  And I'm like, you're not going to have work to go to here pretty soon dad, like let's be real.
[01:14:14.368 --> 01:14:19.511]  But it's like they have a block to it.
[01:14:19.571 --> 01:14:27.055]  Well I get it, I mean it's stressful to admit this is all happening and you know people want to just, does he know Klaus Schwab wants to ban his cows?
[01:14:27.416 --> 01:14:28.536]  Does he know Bill Gates wants to?
[01:14:28.556 --> 01:14:29.637]  Does he even know about those attacks?
[01:14:31.554 --> 01:14:32.394]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:14:32.414 --> 01:14:36.498]  I tried to say something to my sister because she does the whole cattle thing with him.
[01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:42.123]  And I even mentioned last weekend, I'm like, oh, we should save a couple of these steers before you guys sell them in June.
[01:14:42.864 --> 01:14:43.644]  And he's like, why's that?
[01:14:43.664 --> 01:14:46.067]  And I'm like, well, we're going to be needing the meat in the next couple of years.
[01:14:46.467 --> 01:14:49.830]  I went to Costco and it was almost $100 for free tri tips.
[01:14:49.890 --> 01:14:52.332]  I'm like, I can't afford that.
[01:14:52.993 --> 01:14:56.296]  And him and my aunt were sitting there because we're all in business together.
[01:14:56.857 --> 01:14:58.277]  You know, I thought it was crazy.
[01:14:58.638 --> 01:15:06.180]  I'm like, well... Yeah, they just went through years of lockdowns and Governor Newsom, but they think you're crazy.
[01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:08.320]  Well, you know, you can't save everybody.
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:12.842]  So, and again, I would just plant the seeds.
[01:15:12.862 --> 01:15:13.562]  Thank you for the call.
[01:15:13.582 --> 01:15:15.482]  We're moving on to a lot of callers here.
[01:15:15.502 --> 01:15:15.983]  Great callers.
[01:15:16.043 --> 01:15:17.103]  Jeff in Canada, you're on the air.
[01:15:17.143 --> 01:15:17.583]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[01:15:19.464 --> 01:15:20.884]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:26.693]  I just want to say there's a passage in the Bible that says, don't fix the roof in the rain.
[01:15:27.273 --> 01:15:29.754]  And I think it's really poignant for the times we're in.
[01:15:29.774 --> 01:15:31.575]  Say that Bible verse again.
[01:15:31.595 --> 01:15:34.737]  It says, don't fix the roof in the rain.
[01:15:35.757 --> 01:15:36.177]  Good point.
[01:15:37.998 --> 01:15:42.861]  And I think it's really poignant on a spiritual level and on a practical level, and I'll touch on both.
[01:15:43.761 --> 01:15:47.143]  But first on a spiritual level, you always say we need to get right with God.
[01:15:47.943 --> 01:15:51.065]  And people need to understand this is a spiritual battle.
[01:15:51.716 --> 01:15:53.880]  Consider it like this is the easy way to think about it.
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:55.643]  It's like in the heavenly realms.
[01:15:55.683 --> 01:16:02.969]   There's a deep state and the evil fallen angels on the - there's a percentage of them that
[01:16:02.969 --> 01:16:03.509]  are fallen.
[01:16:03.509 --> 01:16:05.909]  One-third, the Bible says, are fallen.
[01:16:05.909 --> 01:16:11.189]   And the evil - and they corrupt and co-opt the evil people on the earth.
[01:16:11.189 --> 01:16:13.509]  And it's like two governments working together.
[01:16:13.509 --> 01:16:17.510]   And that's why you see this demonic manifestation manifesting all over the place,
[01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:19.829]  and all the evil that people are saying.
[01:16:19.829 --> 01:16:25.590]   It's because those realms are cooperating together, and it's manifesting on the earth.
[01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:29.590]   Well, God has a solution for us, and the solution is Jesus Christ.
[01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:33.349]  Everything is found within Jesus Christ.
[01:16:33.349 --> 01:16:35.829]  And you say all the time, you've got to get right with God.
[01:16:36.011 --> 01:16:36.872]  I'm going to explain that.
[01:16:38.352 --> 01:16:39.932]  Jesus is Lord of all.
[01:16:40.312 --> 01:16:43.053]  He is God over the fallen angels.
[01:16:43.113 --> 01:16:45.313]  He's God in human flesh.
[01:16:45.353 --> 01:16:51.835]  He's the Creator, and there are good angels that follow after the Creator God, who is on our side.
[01:16:52.415 --> 01:17:05.162]   We win in the end, but what it's going to require is the good people on earth That call out to God, then God can loose the angels on behalf of the believers.
[01:17:05.722 --> 01:17:11.124]  There's two, there's a spiritual side, there's a spiritual war in heaven and there's a spiritual war on the earth.
[01:17:11.504 --> 01:17:28.232]   We have to understand that God wants to deploy on our behalf, but it's going to take people calling out to God in genuine prayer and then doing what is practically in front of them according to their assignment That we'll all knit and weave together, and that is our strategy.
[01:17:28.633 --> 01:17:32.936]  That's our mission statement and our ideology that we have to go forward with.
[01:17:33.797 --> 01:17:45.787]  Very simply, how we get right with Jesus is we believe God's plan that He instituted before the creation of the world, that Christ would come and make it right for us on our behalf.
[01:17:46.385 --> 01:17:48.026]  For every man, woman, and child.
[01:17:48.646 --> 01:17:52.527]  Not everybody will accept that offer, but it's been done for everybody.
[01:17:52.927 --> 01:18:05.352]  So if you are a person that knows you need God, know this, that Jesus has paid the price on the cross for you, and you are fully accepted in the Beloved of Christ.
[01:18:06.013 --> 01:18:12.897]  When you say yes to Jesus and you repent, which means a change of mind, you change your mind of, I'm not going solo in this life anymore.
[01:18:13.117 --> 01:18:14.178]  I'm not going to do this myself.
[01:18:14.258 --> 01:18:15.158]  I'm going to follow God.
[01:18:15.558 --> 01:18:17.159]  That is biblical repentance.
[01:18:17.239 --> 01:18:20.441]  And of course, it's all the garbage in your life, too, is included in that.
[01:18:20.781 --> 01:18:27.285]  But when you change your mind and you follow Christ and you say yes to God, the Bible says you're born again.
[01:18:27.365 --> 01:18:30.126]  You start a relationship with God that will never end.
[01:18:30.707 --> 01:18:39.678]   When you die, If you're a soldier in this war, and when you die, you go on to glory, to be with God, just like Jesus is in his resurrected body.
[01:18:40.158 --> 01:18:45.881]  And I'll tell everybody, the only way out of this situation is Jesus, period.
[01:18:46.341 --> 01:18:51.063]  There is no other way under heaven by which a person can be saved.
[01:18:51.483 --> 01:18:52.724]  God is core reality.
[01:18:52.904 --> 01:18:56.806]  He is the Creator, and we must give our lives to Christ.
[01:18:57.466 --> 01:18:59.507]  And we will have fullness of joy.
[01:19:00.023 --> 01:19:10.089]  Alex, today I sit here joyful in my own salvation, knowing that I'm with God forever, but I have this burden for other people that don't know God.
[01:19:10.489 --> 01:19:17.754]  We need to clearly present the Gospel, which the Bible says is the power of God to salvation for him that believes.
[01:19:18.094 --> 01:19:23.477]  When we present the Gospel to people and they say yes, that belief makes them right with God.
[01:19:24.088 --> 01:19:30.291]  We get deceived by believing something wrong, we get saved by believing the right solution.
[01:19:30.712 --> 01:19:39.436]  So I wanted to clearly lay that out for everybody and just say everybody's been gifted with personal things that you can do on a practical level.
[01:19:39.857 --> 01:19:47.100]  God is extremely practical, but he wants us to be drawing from that inner source to do the practical things that we need to do.
[01:19:47.601 --> 01:19:56.207]   I want to call evangelists and teachers that know the gospel in truth To begin to speak as loud as they can and to teach others to follow Christ.
[01:19:56.727 --> 01:20:06.956]  And I just pray that everybody follows God in their lane and we will work together and we will follow the great symphony that God has for us into all eternity.
[01:20:07.276 --> 01:20:09.738]  The Book of Revelation says we win in the end.
[01:20:10.490 --> 01:20:20.178]  We win, and we will be together with God, and God will set up His government on the earth, and He will bring us back to a garden of Eden state in His time.
[01:20:20.698 --> 01:20:23.941]  But it all comes through the person of Jesus Christ.
[01:20:25.003 --> 01:20:25.703]  That's all I'll say.
[01:20:25.764 --> 01:20:26.284]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:20:26.664 --> 01:20:27.465]  Now, beautifully said.
[01:20:27.605 --> 01:20:29.306]  I mean, look, this is a satanic attack.
[01:20:29.486 --> 01:20:31.147]  Only God can lead, God can direct us.
[01:20:31.467 --> 01:20:32.808]  And it's true.
[01:20:32.868 --> 01:20:33.989]  And God's free will.
[01:20:34.529 --> 01:20:37.611]  The devil is deception and anti-free will.
[01:20:38.431 --> 01:20:44.095]  And that's what people have to understand is we are facing a spiritual assault.
[01:20:45.135 --> 01:20:50.394]   And so it's having that relationship with God That is gonna allow us to transcend this.
[01:20:50.974 --> 01:20:52.475]  And what you said is perfect, it's true.
[01:20:52.955 --> 01:21:00.619]  You pray to God, you ask God to come into your life and to send his angels, and then to go out and take on the new world order.
[01:21:00.659 --> 01:21:04.101]  And you will be attacked, but for every attack, 10 more doors open.
[01:21:04.441 --> 01:21:07.943]  It's very intense, it's very real, it's very spiritual.
[01:21:07.963 --> 01:21:11.945]  And the devil will say, well, you're not really close to God, you're fallen.
[01:21:11.965 --> 01:21:14.967]  And will try to like, make you feel, you know you're fallen.
[01:21:15.226 --> 01:21:20.145]  God is there to sanctify you and just move forward.
[01:21:20.145 --> 01:21:23.186]   So I guess I'm a sinner, I'm not perfect, but I'm pointing my soul at God
[01:21:23.186 --> 01:21:28.186]   and I'm following these directives and God's gonna tell me what to do.
[01:21:28.186 --> 01:21:36.367]   And when you dial into that, it is infinitely, infinitely upon infinitely, upon infinitely,
[01:21:36.367 --> 01:21:41.945]   unlimitedly more powerful than Satan who's able to organize a bunch of people
[01:21:41.945 --> 01:21:49.787]   to go against themselves and do a bunch of evil crap you engage in all this blasphemy against God's creation.
[01:21:48.149 --> 01:21:49.209]  It's all going to fail!
[01:21:49.649 --> 01:21:52.731]  We have been given free will on this beautiful planet, this beautiful universe.
[01:21:53.231 --> 01:21:55.673]  We have all this incredible potential.
[01:21:56.013 --> 01:22:07.818]   Whatever we envision we're able to do because the Old Testament in Genesis tells us we're not God, but we're made in the image of God, little g. And look at how awesome we are.
[01:22:08.518 --> 01:22:13.843]  But the more we dial into just our own creations and believe, oh, we're God, the more we're enslaved.
[01:22:13.863 --> 01:22:14.563]  We're not God.
[01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:21.316]   And only God can give us the blueprint And the manual for how to deal with this.
[01:22:21.356 --> 01:22:22.476]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:22:22.556 --> 01:22:28.359]  Carlos, Justin, Brian the Lion, Del Rita, Nathaniel, Tony, Josh, Taylor.
[01:22:28.679 --> 01:22:29.519]  I'm taking your calls.
[01:22:29.579 --> 01:22:32.801]  The order they receive, please follow me at X at RealAlexJones.
[01:22:32.861 --> 01:22:34.402]  It's really important for us to stay in touch with each other.
[01:22:35.382 --> 01:22:40.584]  Real Alex Jones on X and of course InfoWars.com forward slash show and Bandai Video.
[01:22:40.604 --> 01:22:41.164]  We'll be right back.
[01:22:41.585 --> 01:22:43.445]  And I'm sorry people the bad news folks.
[01:22:43.605 --> 01:22:44.346]  It's all over.
[01:22:44.926 --> 01:22:46.627]  We need to get ready now.
[01:22:47.007 --> 01:22:50.048]  People need to go to KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:22:50.368 --> 01:22:52.129]  KEPM.com forward slash gold.
[01:22:52.469 --> 01:22:53.229]  You need to get ready.
[01:22:53.309 --> 01:22:54.270]  This is the place to go.
[01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:55.130]  I love them.
[01:22:55.150 --> 01:22:55.910]  They're great sponsors.
[01:22:55.930 --> 01:22:56.630]  They're great people.
[01:22:56.991 --> 01:22:57.711]  Or you can call 720-605-3900.
[01:23:00.812 --> 01:23:05.494]  In my opinion, you are insane if you don't get into silver right now and get some gold.
[01:23:06.174 --> 01:23:07.095]  And I wish I could do it.
[01:23:07.275 --> 01:23:08.315]  I'm under enemy attack.
[01:23:08.776 --> 01:23:09.476]  It's okay.
[01:23:09.536 --> 01:23:09.936]  It's fine.
[01:23:10.256 --> 01:23:20.781]  But I'm just looking at all of you wishing I was in the position you're in right now because I wish this wasn't the case, but I intellectually and spiritually know I'm 100% right.
[01:23:20.821 --> 01:23:21.941]  And I think you all know it too.
[01:23:22.341 --> 01:23:23.362]  We are screwed.
[01:23:24.252 --> 01:23:27.113]  But the good news is, humanity's waking up and we're going to turn this around.
[01:23:27.553 --> 01:23:29.113]  So, buckle up, folks!
[01:23:29.353 --> 01:23:32.074]  Buckle up and get ready now!
[01:23:32.534 --> 01:23:40.596]  Because the greatest crisis of all of our lives is happening now, and I'm just the watchman on the wall, the Paul Revere, telling you, the New World Order's coming.
[01:23:40.996 --> 01:23:41.336]  It's here.
[01:23:41.356 --> 01:23:44.757]  It's all a test, my friends, and feel sorry for those that joined Satan.
[01:23:46.718 --> 01:23:47.798]  Because they failed the test.
[01:23:47.858 --> 01:23:49.259]  I'm going to go right back to your phone calls.
[01:23:51.079 --> 01:23:53.360]  You've kept us on air 30 years.
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:54.300]  You've been amazing.
[01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:56.301]  I believe InfoWars should be saved.
[01:23:56.321 --> 01:23:56.841]  I don't know.
[01:23:56.861 --> 01:23:58.321]  We're going to find out in the next month or so.
[01:23:58.881 --> 01:24:00.562]  We'll definitely be here at least in July.
[01:24:00.582 --> 01:24:03.703]  The earliest they can shut us down is right around July 4th, funny enough.
[01:24:04.183 --> 01:24:08.924]  Maybe a little bit later, but if you get your orders in now on InfoWarsTour.com, get those t-shirts, get those books, get those films.
[01:24:10.455 --> 01:24:12.796]  Get the Nitric Boost, get the X3, get the bodies.

[01:25:24.804 --> 01:25:27.845]  It's great products, take action now, drjonesnaturals.com.
[01:25:28.645 --> 01:25:31.586]  And I have waited and waited on the future of InfoWars.
[01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:37.203]  But our political enemies, the Democratic Party, just said, no, we're not settling with you.
[01:25:39.744 --> 01:25:42.845]  Unless you come out against the Second Amendment and other things.
[01:25:43.565 --> 01:25:44.686]  Well, what are those things?
[01:25:44.706 --> 01:25:45.826]  We'll just meet with us, we'll tell you.
[01:25:45.886 --> 01:25:46.686]  No thanks.
[01:25:46.806 --> 01:25:47.927]  I could have sold out a long time ago.
[01:25:48.587 --> 01:25:54.653]  That's not going to happen, but in the interim, keep InfoWars on the air because we just think we're dead and you don't support it, then we get shut down.
[01:25:55.113 --> 01:26:00.298]  So it's important to support drjonesandactuals.com, drjonesandactuals.com and infowarsstore.com.
[01:26:00.878 --> 01:26:01.939]  And boy, what a collector's item.
[01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:03.541]  Last run of InfoWars t-shirts.
[01:26:03.601 --> 01:26:08.325]  I mean, we're, I'll know in the next couple of weeks, you know, pretty much what's going on.
[01:26:08.345 --> 01:26:09.586]  It'll take a few months to shut us down.
[01:26:10.828 --> 01:26:12.208]  Obviously, Lord willing, I'll be back.
[01:26:12.828 --> 01:26:15.849]  I feel sorry for the crew, but it's just the enemy's nature.
[01:26:15.889 --> 01:26:20.410]  They just want that victory to say InfoWars taken off the air.
[01:26:20.430 --> 01:26:22.090]  Yeah, we've got the Alex Jones for President shirt.
[01:26:22.211 --> 01:26:23.551]  Is that even still in stock?
[01:26:24.171 --> 01:26:27.612]  Okay, let's now go back to the phone calls here, but thank you for your support.
[01:26:27.632 --> 01:26:30.892]  If you want to support us, take action now, drjonesnatchels.com.
[01:26:31.132 --> 01:26:33.233]  That's what I'm asking you to do, if you support the broadcast.
[01:26:33.273 --> 01:26:34.833]  Thank you, drjonesnatchels.com.
[01:26:35.213 --> 01:26:37.494]  Carlos in Canada, thank you so much for calling.
[01:26:37.514 --> 01:26:37.914]  You're on the air.
[01:26:38.786 --> 01:26:39.826]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:26:39.986 --> 01:26:44.848]  I do wish that InfoWars will survive, especially until after November.
[01:26:45.289 --> 01:26:46.369]  It's very, very important.
[01:26:47.349 --> 01:26:49.050]  But that's why they want it.
[01:26:49.090 --> 01:26:49.930]  That's what's happening.
[01:26:50.751 --> 01:26:52.892]  I know, but you know, you're not alone.
[01:26:53.912 --> 01:27:00.369]   And if you think you're alone, then that's when people begin to fear that They're going to lose.
[01:27:00.850 --> 01:27:06.311]  The situation is one in which I, when I was a kid, 18 years old, I was pulled aside by a doctor.
[01:27:06.692 --> 01:27:21.217]  You know, we were just in the United States, a Marine-based doctor in Virginia, and he pulled my father aside and he said, you know, your son Carlos, he should really, he's always asking questions and science would be good for him.
[01:27:21.897 --> 01:27:23.657]  And he gave me two books to read.
[01:27:23.757 --> 01:27:28.079]  One was, none dare call it conspiracy.
[01:27:28.409 --> 01:27:32.409]  and the other one was the Rockefeller files.
[01:27:32.409 --> 01:27:36.409]   And I read them on the way back in the car, on the way back to Washington,
[01:27:36.409 --> 01:27:42.409]   where we stopped at John F. Kennedy's tomb, and then to Montreal, and I discussed this with my dad.
[01:27:42.409 --> 01:27:49.409]   And it set a number of questions that, since that time, I have been pursuing.
[01:27:49.409 --> 01:27:53.409]   So just that one interface changed the whole course of your life?
[01:27:53.409 --> 01:27:54.409]  Oh, it did.
[01:27:54.688 --> 01:28:01.872]  Well, besides the scientific direction, which I took from that moment on, which, as you know, we don't talk about it today, but it took me pretty far.
[01:28:01.892 --> 01:28:02.592]  That's right.
[01:28:02.612 --> 01:28:03.533]  You've been a guest on the show.
[01:28:03.553 --> 01:28:04.693]  There's some really prominent stuff.
[01:28:05.574 --> 01:28:11.017]  Well, yes, I was, I was, I was trained by the pioneers in neuropsychology and cognitive psychology.
[01:28:11.117 --> 01:28:13.618]  So, yeah, I think, I think I know a little bit.
[01:28:14.078 --> 01:28:25.978]   But the point is that after all the hobby reading and reading about the Rockefellers and reading about the Rothschilds who financed them, all that, and the banking and so on. I came to the
[01:28:25.978 --> 01:28:32.827]   conclusion that for a primer for anybody today who wants to know and to understand this inversion, read
[01:28:32.827 --> 01:28:39.686]   the first 150 or so hundred pages of Tragedy and Hope by Carol Quigley.
[01:28:39.932 --> 01:28:42.233]  You mentioned this before, but it's there.
[01:28:43.173 --> 01:28:51.275]  There he gives you the formula what's being achieved by a small group of people, what they call the 300, etc.
[01:28:51.355 --> 01:28:52.215]  Churchill was one of them.
[01:28:52.235 --> 01:28:52.895]  There are many of them.
[01:28:52.915 --> 01:28:54.276]  They're identifiable.
[01:28:54.316 --> 01:28:55.476]  They're identifiable even today.
[01:28:56.076 --> 01:29:00.079]  The classes and the masses, he describes, two kinds of people.
[01:29:00.459 --> 01:29:06.703]  Those who are, they call the classes, and the controlling classes, and the masses which they exploit.
[01:29:07.123 --> 01:29:13.707]  And the balance which they try to keep is how to keep the masses docile and, you know, subservient.
[01:29:14.068 --> 01:29:22.653]  But underlying all this is something that throughout the history of man has existed, and that is a tribal control of one over the other.
[01:29:23.554 --> 01:29:24.074]  Slavery.
[01:29:24.514 --> 01:29:35.425]   So if you look at The Constitution of the United States, it's primarily founded against the classes and the masses, where the individual is sovereign and interpublic.
[01:29:35.825 --> 01:29:39.429]  And second, it is the fight of the freedom.
[01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:46.456]  And now people misunderstand even freedom, because freedom really is free will, the exercise of free will.
[01:29:46.934 --> 01:29:50.275]  And the exercise of free will is what underlies freedom.
[01:29:51.036 --> 01:29:55.277]  If your vote doesn't matter when you choose your government, you have lost your freedom.
[01:29:56.058 --> 01:29:57.478]  It's the crucible of freedom.
[01:29:58.179 --> 01:30:04.901]  The free people elect the governance of their life for themselves and then for their common society.
[01:30:05.281 --> 01:30:06.222]  And that's the Republic.
[01:30:06.582 --> 01:30:16.566]  And if we lose that in November, then it is perhaps better that the world be destroyed with atomic bombs than to have people live under the conditions you have described before.
[01:30:17.372 --> 01:30:19.155]  How would you describe the moment we're at?
[01:30:19.175 --> 01:30:22.439]  I mean because... I called it an inversion a long time ago.
[01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:24.743]  And this inversion has three legs.
[01:30:25.476 --> 01:30:34.558]  One inversion is the breakdown of the people getting together at churches of their choice, whether they be religious, Catholic, Protestant, or whatever religion they practice.
[01:30:34.858 --> 01:30:43.159]  But they get together once a week, they get together with each other, and there they find the commonality of what they want for their life, for their children, and for their future.
[01:30:43.599 --> 01:30:45.039]  That has been tampered with.
[01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:49.560]  Get back to church, get back to your religion, get back to your spiritual life.
[01:30:49.900 --> 01:30:50.660]  That's the first thing.
[01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:53.801]  100%, that's why all over the world they shut down the churches during the lockdown, they were scared of that.
[01:30:54.730 --> 01:31:08.473]  Right, but that's where the rich man in the front pew's daughter fell in love with the poor boy in the last pew, who was outside meeting her, looking at each other, and then marrying, and then having families together between rich and poor.
[01:31:08.493 --> 01:31:16.134]  Today, you know, my sons, wealthy as we may be, we do not meet with billionaire daughters anymore.
[01:31:16.194 --> 01:31:19.775]  They are in different clubs, in different worlds, in different dimensions.
[01:31:20.908 --> 01:31:32.532]  First of all, with the way people select each other these days, you wouldn't be able to meet and marry the daughter of, let's say, anyone who was a billionaire just like that, just by coincidence and falling in love.
[01:31:32.913 --> 01:31:40.355]  Even if you were John Wayne or Gregory Peck or some great actor like Gary Cooper in the movies, it doesn't happen anymore.
[01:31:40.755 --> 01:31:43.857]  So what we have to have today is get together.
[01:31:44.117 --> 01:31:44.757]  That's one leg.
[01:31:45.612 --> 01:31:49.176]  Have your understanding of each other's desires.
[01:31:49.236 --> 01:31:53.159]  Second, make sure the November elections, your vote counts.
[01:31:53.179 --> 01:31:54.841]  Otherwise, your freedom is gone.
[01:31:54.861 --> 01:32:07.473]  And number three, which is not understood, is that if you work against someone's freedom to choose the government they want by either stealing their vote or bribing their vote, that's treason.
[01:32:08.203 --> 01:32:18.545]  Understand, if you don't let people vote their will, then at the election time, you have a foreign power coming over that's taking over your country.
[01:32:18.565 --> 01:32:19.765]  That is treason.
[01:32:20.085 --> 01:32:21.785]  This is what an inversion has cost.
[01:32:22.246 --> 01:32:32.207]  And it starts, in my opinion, a long time ago by simply not understanding and correcting the fact that people want money and they want wealth.
[01:32:33.027 --> 01:32:35.708]  The millionaires today are finding out that they have been betrayed.
[01:32:37.907 --> 01:32:38.227]  I agree.
[01:32:38.247 --> 01:32:39.427]  What do you think is going to happen with Trump?
[01:32:39.887 --> 01:32:42.748]  Because everything's blowing in the global's face, but they're only intensifying.
[01:32:44.148 --> 01:32:46.089]  President Trump has beaten all records.
[01:32:46.109 --> 01:32:50.429]  You know, politicians don't run for four years straight and keep on top.
[01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:52.730]  They don't peak too early.
[01:32:53.470 --> 01:32:57.331]  No one's ever been nominated three times for a president either.
[01:32:57.411 --> 01:32:58.611]  No, he's already broken all the records.
[01:32:59.431 --> 01:32:59.631]  Yes.
[01:33:00.151 --> 01:33:15.911]   I think President Trump should get a vice president who is Going to, you know, if something happens to him, regardless of age or whatever, if he's not the president once elected, he should choose a vice president that will continue his policy and that they will fear.
[01:33:15.931 --> 01:33:18.571]  That's number one, because of continuity of policy.
[01:33:18.871 --> 01:33:25.733]  And number two, because the globalists or whoever wants to destroy his presidency will then, it's his insurance.
[01:33:26.232 --> 01:33:27.392]  You know, that they won't do it.
[01:33:27.612 --> 01:33:30.273]  Because if they do it, then the policy will continue.
[01:33:30.873 --> 01:33:33.114]  I don't just think President Trump.
[01:33:33.134 --> 01:33:36.675]  I think he has seen in the last four years what people are capable of doing.
[01:33:36.695 --> 01:33:39.595]  Oh, he's definitely a lot more hardcore now.
[01:33:39.615 --> 01:33:40.596]  That's why they're so scared of him.
[01:33:41.276 --> 01:33:42.096]  That's correct, Alex.
[01:33:42.196 --> 01:33:46.697]  And I love the way InfoWars has handled itself throughout the vicissitudes.
[01:33:47.177 --> 01:33:49.538]  You have not fallen to prey, to weakness.
[01:33:50.106 --> 01:33:52.067]  You have strengthened people.
[01:33:52.308 --> 01:34:00.754]  People like Dr. Carlson and other individuals are now awake and they're not just aware, they're spiritually strengthened in truth.
[01:34:01.454 --> 01:34:08.219]  If you want to be aware of where your solution lies as an individual, tell the truth for 30 days.
[01:34:08.279 --> 01:34:08.459]  Try it.
[01:34:10.276 --> 01:34:19.788]  You'll see your Holy Spirit, whatever you want to call your cognitive juices in your brain, will drive you towards reason and questioning.
[01:34:20.069 --> 01:34:23.513]  And as soon as you start reasoning and questioning, you'll have discernment.
[01:34:23.874 --> 01:34:24.975]  And that's what you have, Alex.
[01:34:25.276 --> 01:34:26.197]  You have discernment.
[01:34:26.923 --> 01:34:31.885]  Well, that's the thing about telling the truth, is your brain, you gear it towards lies, it gears towards that.
[01:34:31.905 --> 01:34:36.127]  When you gear it towards truth, everything opens up and I see the enemies that serve evil.
[01:34:36.567 --> 01:34:39.409]  They're so unhappy, they have no idea how good it is to be good.
[01:34:40.089 --> 01:34:40.909]  They're really foolish.
[01:34:41.289 --> 01:34:46.972]  And I think we're like these idiot, goody two-shoes that they think we're the dumb ones because we don't know about deception.
[01:34:47.052 --> 01:34:47.972]  No, we know all about it.
[01:34:48.252 --> 01:34:49.453]  We choose not to participate.
[01:34:50.706 --> 01:34:50.886]  Yes.
[01:34:51.266 --> 01:34:55.787]  I don't like to make predictions, so I will make one prediction, which I think is tragic.
[01:34:56.187 --> 01:35:04.869]  And that is, I predict that in future, unless we change and find our freedom, there will be a time when people will be forced to bring their books.
[01:35:05.249 --> 01:35:10.391]  You know those books that you have in libraries that are book-binded and have pages and words written on them?
[01:35:10.731 --> 01:35:16.852]  You will have to surrender them, because once they tell you, no, no, no, it's very practical to have electronic books, you know?
[01:35:17.112 --> 01:35:18.052]  Just like you have electronic books.
[01:35:18.072 --> 01:35:19.333]  Oh, no, they're already censoring everything.
[01:35:19.373 --> 01:35:19.893]  That's their mission.
[01:35:20.783 --> 01:35:21.223]  That's correct.
[01:35:21.684 --> 01:35:26.087]  One day they will ban books, and that day will be really a tragic day.
[01:35:26.407 --> 01:35:30.531]  And then they spin it that Republicans are banning books, saying don't give six-year-olds pedophile books.
[01:35:30.571 --> 01:35:36.755]  No, not giving a child a bottle of Jack Daniels is not shutting down liquor sales, it's, you know, give it to five-year-olds.
[01:35:37.156 --> 01:35:40.598]  And not giving them a pedophile book is not censorship, it's protecting children.
[01:35:40.638 --> 01:35:41.299]  Thank you so much.
[01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:46.103]  All right, let's go to Darlita in Oklahoma.
[01:35:46.123 --> 01:35:47.244]  Thanks for calling, thanks for holding.
[01:35:47.264 --> 01:35:47.524]  Go ahead.
[01:35:48.908 --> 01:35:51.428]  Hi Alex, I was going to say, you did good.
[01:35:51.649 --> 01:35:52.109]  You did good.
[01:35:52.129 --> 01:35:55.489]  You woke up a lot of people and brought them to God, and that's what matters.
[01:35:55.629 --> 01:35:56.890]  So, we appreciate that.
[01:35:57.530 --> 01:36:01.150]  Second of all, yes, I'm worried about the elections being suspended.
[01:36:01.190 --> 01:36:06.691]  I'm worried about UN already having soldiers crossed by NGO and set up for martial law.
[01:36:06.711 --> 01:36:09.452]  Because, really, that's one way they could try to take our guns.
[01:36:10.612 --> 01:36:12.833]  So, I'm looking for all of this to come down.
[01:36:12.853 --> 01:36:14.213]  And yes, you're right.
[01:36:14.253 --> 01:36:15.133]  Get to know your neighborhood.
[01:36:15.632 --> 01:36:21.175]  It don't matter if they're shady or not, get to know them, because whenever crap goes down, your neighborhood's going to pull together.
[01:36:21.195 --> 01:36:23.396]  That's right.
[01:36:23.436 --> 01:36:30.600]  What do you think of the reports that are on InfoWars from very credible people that they talk to the British military and they've actually, I can see this as military coming across.
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:34.822]  I know they're military, but they're trained by NATO to take down America.
[01:36:34.862 --> 01:36:35.503]  What do you make of that?
[01:36:36.623 --> 01:36:37.404]  That's what I'm thinking.
[01:36:37.604 --> 01:36:41.306]  I'm thinking that, you know, they've set up what they need for their U.N.
[01:36:41.406 --> 01:36:43.647]  soldiers and their protesters.
[01:36:47.277 --> 01:36:48.158]  That's what I'm worried about.
[01:36:48.198 --> 01:36:52.621]  I'm worried about them trying to suspend the elections for a state of war, put us in a state of war.
[01:36:53.722 --> 01:37:01.267]  I read somewhere, I was going through some podcasts and I don't remember who it was, said something that the UK may declare war with Russia sometime in late August.
[01:37:04.318 --> 01:37:05.099]  Yeah, I know.
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:09.226]  The EU is basically sending troops in and saying they're already at war.
[01:37:09.346 --> 01:37:12.351]  And they are basically slow walking everybody into that.
[01:37:12.392 --> 01:37:13.734]  So you're exactly right.
[01:37:13.794 --> 01:37:14.515]  Thank you so much.
[01:37:15.276 --> 01:37:16.939]  Nathaniel in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:37:16.959 --> 01:37:17.260]  Welcome.
[01:37:19.153 --> 01:37:20.474]  It's Natalie, but that's okay.
[01:37:20.494 --> 01:37:21.975]  I'm sorry, I read it wrong, Natalie.
[01:37:22.035 --> 01:37:22.556]  I'm an idiot.
[01:37:22.616 --> 01:37:23.696]  No, it is Natalie.
[01:37:23.797 --> 01:37:24.017]  No, no.
[01:37:24.097 --> 01:37:24.457]  Go ahead.
[01:37:24.517 --> 01:37:24.737]  No.
[01:37:25.818 --> 01:37:28.920]  Well, speaking about the nature of evil, it is inversion.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:37.086]  So, to me, I think about Christ and He, and John, it talks about how He was the Word that became flesh and dwelt among us.
[01:37:37.207 --> 01:37:43.031]  So, to me, all this AI stuff is algorithms manifesting a machine seeking to destroy us.
[01:37:43.897 --> 01:37:50.664]  So I see this evil thread through all of this, and people keep thinking, what should we do to combat this?
[01:37:50.764 --> 01:37:56.531]  And again, Christ in Scripture said the most powerful thing you can do to cast out evil is fasting.
[01:37:56.991 --> 01:38:07.319]   So of course everybody's praying right now, but if we could fast, maybe just like Skip breakfast or prolong the time you have between meals and you say to God, I'm doing this for you, Lord.
[01:38:07.359 --> 01:38:11.040]  I'm doing this for your kingdom to be triumphant here on Earth.
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:13.441]  And it's also super healthy.
[01:38:14.062 --> 01:38:15.062]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:38:15.102 --> 01:38:16.623]  I mean, that's the most anti-cancer thing there is.
[01:38:16.643 --> 01:38:18.163]  Not that I follow it, but I know the literature.
[01:38:18.204 --> 01:38:19.804]  I know the evidence.
[01:38:19.824 --> 01:38:20.084]  Yes.
[01:38:21.105 --> 01:38:24.967]  And then I was just going to really say, have Zachary King on.
[01:38:25.107 --> 01:38:29.649]  He is a converted former high wizard in the Satanic Church.
[01:38:31.155 --> 01:38:35.298]  Even speaks about his run-ins with Bill Gates himself in those circles.
[01:38:35.838 --> 01:38:38.940]  I think he would connect a lot of dots for you and your listeners.
[01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:49.267]  He's got really amazing interviews already on YouTube with Father Nix and kind of all of the actual... Well, I know that Melinda Gates does wear upside-down crosses on TV.
[01:38:50.167 --> 01:38:56.811]  Yes, so he ran into... He's got a story about him and Bill Gates in Adrenochrome and like the whole nine yards.
[01:38:56.912 --> 01:39:07.453]   It's absolutely terrifying, but also now that we've I don't know about his story.
[01:39:07.533 --> 01:39:15.577]  I just know Bill Gates took over all the medical systems, took over the regulatory agencies worldwide with the deep state funding and gave us poison shots that have killed 22 million people.
[01:39:15.597 --> 01:39:19.479]  So I don't know if he's at satanic rituals drinking blood, but man, he sure as hell killed a lot of people.
[01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:20.320]  That's a fact.
[01:39:21.508 --> 01:39:22.108]  Absolutely.
[01:39:22.749 --> 01:39:28.911]  But good news is, like everyone else before has said, God wins, Jesus Christ is King, that's how we win.
[01:39:28.951 --> 01:39:32.393]  So everybody pray and fast as much as you personally can.
[01:39:32.413 --> 01:39:33.734]  Thank you, Natalie.
[01:39:33.774 --> 01:39:34.654]  Thank you so much.
[01:39:34.714 --> 01:39:35.534]  Good to talk to you.
[01:39:35.875 --> 01:39:36.675]  We're moving quick here.
[01:39:36.735 --> 01:39:38.756]  Josh in California, you're on the air.
[01:39:38.776 --> 01:39:41.097]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:39:41.237 --> 01:39:41.777]  Good, brother.
[01:39:41.837 --> 01:39:43.398]  I wanted to get your take on something.
[01:39:43.738 --> 01:39:47.378]   We know Bill Gates who said their next pandemic and virus will be far deadlier,
[01:39:47.378 --> 01:39:50.217]  whether that's bird flu or disease X or whatever.
[01:39:50.217 --> 01:39:53.497]  They said it'll be like an 80% fatality rate.
[01:39:53.497 --> 01:39:57.458]   And there's only been roughly 5% of the people who've got the latest booster.
[01:39:57.458 --> 01:40:01.577]   They know a majority of the people won't take the next vaccine because we've lost
[01:40:01.968 --> 01:40:04.690]  So do you think that's by design?
[01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:13.957]  I mean they've already killed so many with the COVID vax and they know we're not going to take the next vaccine when maybe we should because this next one will be the real deal.
[01:40:14.157 --> 01:40:21.503]  This way they've killed people who took the first one and will kill the hesitant unvaxed with a legitimate second virus that was actually created to kill.
[01:40:22.318 --> 01:40:24.699]  Yeah, you know, that's all speculation.
[01:40:24.739 --> 01:40:25.920]  I'm not saying it's bad to speculate.
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:29.722]  I just think that it's a lot harder to kill people with viruses than they act like.
[01:40:30.322 --> 01:40:35.665]  So I think they're going to poison the food supply or something and say it's a virus to create fear to take the shot.
[01:40:36.306 --> 01:40:41.188]  And I don't think they're going to give people a vaccine that actually protects them and most of them don't even do anything to make you sick.
[01:40:41.409 --> 01:40:42.249]  They're all contaminated.
[01:40:44.724 --> 01:40:46.405]  They really thought they could manage things.
[01:40:46.986 --> 01:40:49.047]  They really thought they could get this over on people.
[01:40:49.107 --> 01:40:51.609]  And they did for a while, but then it blew up in their face.
[01:40:51.689 --> 01:40:53.830]  So, you know, I really can't speculate.
[01:40:53.850 --> 01:40:56.992]  I know that nobody's catching bird flu, but they say they are.
[01:40:57.052 --> 01:40:58.774]  You read the fine print, they admit nobody is.
[01:40:58.834 --> 01:41:00.034]  That's their next big scare.
[01:41:00.134 --> 01:41:00.315]  Right.
[01:41:00.655 --> 01:41:02.036]  It's like monkey pox in Marburg.
[01:41:03.076 --> 01:41:04.097]  So, I don't know.
[01:41:04.117 --> 01:41:05.458]  I mean, I think all cards are on the table.
[01:41:05.498 --> 01:41:07.800]  Cyber outages, false flags.
[01:41:07.820 --> 01:41:09.481]  I mean, I think we're definitely in that area.
[01:41:11.371 --> 01:41:13.572]  Yeah, yeah, I agree with you.
[01:41:13.632 --> 01:41:21.274]  And just one other thing, do you know what the payload of from vaccinated to un-vaxxed is?
[01:41:21.294 --> 01:41:26.316]  I mean, I'm un-vaxxed, but I was, my ex-girlfriend, she was vaxxed.
[01:41:26.836 --> 01:41:31.298]  And, you know, you were talking with Judy, Dr. Judy, about the shedding.
[01:41:31.478 --> 01:41:35.859]  Do we know, like, what the percentage of that shedding is that gets transferred yet?
[01:41:36.599 --> 01:41:41.878]   No, because even with AstraZeneca or J&J, they do the same thing.
[01:41:41.878 --> 01:41:45.938]   They just use a virus that goes in, and a live virus and programs the cell
[01:41:45.938 --> 01:41:48.078]  to make spike protein or nanotech.
[01:41:48.078 --> 01:41:52.319]   But then Moderna is the same thing as Pfizer, it's just three times stronger,
[01:41:52.319 --> 01:41:53.699]  or the equivalent of actually four shots.
[01:41:53.699 --> 01:41:55.899]  So it's the equivalent of four shots.
[01:41:55.899 --> 01:42:00.038]   And we know that Pfizer admits, and Moderna admits shedding does happen.
[01:42:00.038 --> 01:42:02.318]   It's very hard to quantify it, but the evidence is overwhelming
[01:42:02.318 --> 01:42:06.519]   that taking the shot is far worse than catching the virus live,
[01:42:06.519 --> 01:42:11.119]  that is nanotech, or having it shed on you.
[01:42:11.119 --> 01:42:12.119]  Does that make sense?
[01:42:12.119 --> 01:42:15.559]  No, that, yeah, that absolutely does.
[01:42:15.892 --> 01:42:21.975]  And one last thing, you have the Game of the Year, and in my opinion, the Quote of the Year with Rabbi Buttplug, so that makes me laugh.
[01:42:21.795 --> 01:42:22.795]  laughs.
[01:42:22.795 --> 01:42:24.954]  He wants to come back on.
[01:42:24.954 --> 01:42:27.673]  Should I have Rabbi Shmuley back on?
[01:42:27.673 --> 01:42:30.675]  I mean, for the comedy alone, yes.
[01:42:30.675 --> 01:42:34.713]   It kind of feels like I'm doing a Jerry Springer show, but maybe we should have His Holiness
[01:42:34.713 --> 01:42:36.994]  back on.
[01:42:37.003 --> 01:42:38.444]  That guy is something else.
[01:42:38.624 --> 01:42:40.025]  Alright, thank you so much Josh.
[01:42:40.765 --> 01:42:43.707]  Let's go to Brian the Lion in Toronto, Canada.
[01:42:43.527 --> 01:42:45.527]  You're on the air, Brian.
[01:42:45.527 --> 01:42:49.527]  [SIREN]
[01:42:49.527 --> 01:42:52.527]  Sounds like a European ambulance or police car.
[01:42:52.527 --> 01:42:56.527]  [SIREN]
[01:42:56.434 --> 01:42:59.136]  Alex, I got the fiery Scottish blood.
[01:42:59.336 --> 01:43:01.818]  I got a buddy named Brendan who's got the Irish blood.
[01:43:02.358 --> 01:43:05.480]  I heard you and David Icke about a year ago talking about that blood.
[01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:10.403]  Not sure what it is, but he and I talk about your show all the time.
[01:43:10.763 --> 01:43:21.190]  We have calls that are like 10 hours long, talking non-stop back and forth about what your, you know, all the talking points, not talking points, but the reality that you're going through and breaking down for us.
[01:43:22.797 --> 01:43:24.398]  So, anyway, that's fiery blood.
[01:43:25.018 --> 01:43:29.100]  We reflect on it a lot, try to figure out what is it exactly, because we're trying to put our finger on it.
[01:43:29.119 --> 01:43:33.998]   We said that, the globalists have said, it was like Irish and mainly Scots founded Texas,
[01:43:33.998 --> 01:43:34.998]  Scots mainly.
[01:43:34.998 --> 01:43:39.519]   And the globalists actually in white paper say, we don't like the rebellion that came
[01:43:39.519 --> 01:43:45.958]   out of the UK or the British Isles or Ireland, Scotland and England as well.
[01:43:45.958 --> 01:43:49.838]   And so they particularly see that where Magna Carta came out and America came out.
[01:43:49.838 --> 01:43:51.359]  So they're really worried about that.
[01:43:51.359 --> 01:43:59.579]   Like the Romans could ever conquer the Gaelics, which were the Brits and the Welsh.
[01:43:59.579 --> 01:44:05.738]  And so they talk about that whole culture being their enemy.
[01:44:05.802 --> 01:44:06.743]  You're absolutely correct.
[01:44:06.763 --> 01:44:09.224]  I just forgot how it was unfolded.
[01:44:09.284 --> 01:44:12.366]  But the main point is we were trying to pinpoint what it is.
[01:44:12.406 --> 01:44:13.747]  That's my whole life I've been doing.
[01:44:13.787 --> 01:44:14.747]  I think a lot of us have.
[01:44:15.328 --> 01:44:18.009]  And one of the things we came up with, we call it the fed-up factor.
[01:44:18.890 --> 01:44:23.613]  You know, a bad example maybe is, you know, you come in with mud on your shoes about the 10th time.
[01:44:24.233 --> 01:44:28.596]  Whoever, you know, your wife or whatever, at some point you know they're not messing around anymore.
[01:44:29.157 --> 01:44:30.758]  And they, you know, they're yelling at you.
[01:44:30.778 --> 01:44:32.079]  They've hit their fed up factor.
[01:44:32.519 --> 01:44:34.861]  I think we all need to hit that, collectively.
[01:44:35.662 --> 01:44:36.922]  We have to be unafraid.
[01:44:37.803 --> 01:44:38.384]  Well that's it.
[01:44:38.404 --> 01:44:45.549]  I mean, out of all the rebellious groups in the world, there's plenty of them, they just find the Scots and the Irish is particularly not going along with the program.
[01:44:46.229 --> 01:44:48.191]  And, you know, look what's happening in Ireland right now.
[01:44:48.211 --> 01:44:49.472]  They're trying to throw the globalists out.
[01:44:49.952 --> 01:44:52.434]  So they're just afraid of that spirit.
[01:44:54.306 --> 01:44:57.829]  Yeah, and that they should be because I think we need to embrace it more.
[01:44:58.189 --> 01:44:59.610]  It's completely not violent.
[01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:01.231]  It's kind of an unknown.
[01:45:01.291 --> 01:45:02.853]  We don't know what you're going to do with it.
[01:45:02.913 --> 01:45:11.819]  One thing I've found is when I'm trying to be effective and honor the information that you, InfoWars, is passing along to me as a listener, it's like, how can I honor this?
[01:45:11.859 --> 01:45:13.360]  Well, I have to engage with it.
[01:45:13.441 --> 01:45:15.242]  I listen to the second broadcast or whatever.
[01:45:15.262 --> 01:45:17.263]  I don't miss a broadcast, right?
[01:45:17.303 --> 01:45:18.024]  And I stay plugged in.
[01:45:18.044 --> 01:45:19.685]  Well, the biggest thing is that you're already super awake.
[01:45:19.705 --> 01:45:20.206]  Just share it.
[01:45:20.246 --> 01:45:22.247]  People are ready for the truth now.
[01:45:22.287 --> 01:45:23.048]  Now's the time to give it to them.
[01:45:23.806 --> 01:45:25.007]  So I agree.
[01:45:25.267 --> 01:45:26.087]  I try to share it.
[01:45:26.127 --> 01:45:27.288]  You get pushed around a lot.
[01:45:27.348 --> 01:45:30.289]  I've been laughed at for years, whatever, but now they're not laughing anymore.
[01:45:30.329 --> 01:45:33.891]  But the main thing is I found is I have to maintain it in my conscious mind.
[01:45:34.251 --> 01:45:45.957]  If I lapse, I mean, we got to do our tasks daily, but if I lapse, I feel that energetically, if I stay in that mode as much as possible, within reason, during the day, meaning starting my day with InfoWars is what I do when I'm shaving.
[01:45:47.198 --> 01:45:49.119]  That's a key to have the right energy.
[01:45:49.139 --> 01:45:52.481]  It's like an energy signature that can defeat these... No, I totally agree.
[01:45:52.661 --> 01:45:53.681]  I should have more fun.
[01:45:54.162 --> 01:45:55.883]  We should have more fun and I'll let him get us down.
[01:45:55.923 --> 01:46:00.245]  I think what you're saying about being jovial and happy and a happy warrior is absolutely key, brother.
[01:46:00.305 --> 01:46:00.986]  Closing comments.
[01:46:01.806 --> 01:46:05.248]  Yeah, the main point I wanted to make... I've been dying to get through to you.
[01:46:05.268 --> 01:46:05.489]  Go ahead.
[01:46:06.089 --> 01:46:08.170]  Naomi Wolf touched on it.
[01:46:08.230 --> 01:46:09.831]  You've talked about it many a time.
[01:46:10.171 --> 01:46:11.332]  Haven't heard it as much lately.
[01:46:11.372 --> 01:46:12.873]  You did say it a couple of weeks back.
[01:46:13.353 --> 01:46:14.314]  Something along these lines.
[01:46:14.875 --> 01:46:20.662]  I want to think back to, I think it was fall of 2021, I believe it was, when they started floating amnesties.
[01:46:21.303 --> 01:46:34.858]   Now, I believe they did that for a very specific reason, and I haven't heard anyone say anything about it yet, but I believe the amnesty was about galvanizing their underlings to keep them on course, keep them in fear, in control.
[01:46:35.098 --> 01:46:38.221]  So obviously we want whistleblowers, we want them to come forward.
[01:46:38.521 --> 01:46:42.044]  I think we realize they're all kind of mafiosoed and trapped.
[01:46:42.124 --> 01:46:54.814]  I have forgiveness for them personally because I think if you're raised a certain way or you get co-opted into something and leveraged and there's no way out, you know, it's very difficult to make that move and we need them.
[01:46:56.435 --> 01:47:00.000]  I don't want to sound like Nancy Pelosi here, but they're God's children too.
[01:47:00.020 --> 01:47:01.061]  Well, I hear you, Brian.
[01:47:01.381 --> 01:47:02.042]  Love you, brother.
[01:47:02.062 --> 01:47:03.243]  Good to hear from you from Toronto.
[01:47:03.303 --> 01:47:03.884]  Brian the Lion.
[01:47:04.345 --> 01:47:05.266]  All right, third hour.
[01:47:05.286 --> 01:47:14.597]  A few more calls and a special guest from Canada, the evil leader of Diagonalon that Trudeau says is the most evil thing ever seen on Earth.
[01:47:15.171 --> 01:47:18.595]  Alright folks, Nitric Boost is back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:47:55.867 --> 01:48:00.969]   Obviously, we've heard tons of reports over the last last several years, especially of heart problems, myocarditis
[01:48:00.969 --> 01:48:01.929]  and things like that.
[01:48:01.929 --> 01:48:05.449]   We know that Nitric Boost is a way to support your heart health.

[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:24.280]   And it's time for humanity to stand up in the InfoWars and say,
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:28.280]   "I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?"
[01:49:28.255 --> 01:49:30.396]  You better believe you've got one!
[01:49:32.355 --> 01:49:37.795]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:49:37.795 --> 01:49:45.614]  [MUSIC]
[01:49:45.614 --> 01:49:48.914]  The southern border of the United States is wide open.
[01:49:48.914 --> 01:49:52.694]   And the federal government has been conducting a wide scale criminal
[01:49:52.694 --> 01:49:57.074]   operation of flooding the country with unvetted foreigners, distributing them
[01:49:57.074 --> 01:50:01.416]   across the United States and providing them with homes and financial support.
[01:50:01.588 --> 01:50:05.551]  The GOP's talking point has been that this is all about election fraud.
[01:50:05.912 --> 01:50:09.715]  But this has been happening all across the Western world for over a decade.
[01:50:10.075 --> 01:50:12.697]  This is something far more sinister than election fraud.
[01:50:13.278 --> 01:50:18.982]  The Population Division of the United Nations concerns themselves with international migration.
[01:50:19.403 --> 01:50:27.009]  In the year 2000, they published Replacement Migration, a solution put forth to deal with declining and aging populations.
[01:50:27.509 --> 01:50:29.970]  For years we were told that this was a conspiracy theory.
[01:50:30.271 --> 01:50:37.574]  But now that we are seeing tens of millions murdered by the experimental shots, it is becoming more clear what the objective is.
[01:50:38.175 --> 01:50:41.036]  We are told that these are poor families fleeing tyranny.
[01:50:41.356 --> 01:50:45.158]  But there are massive amounts of healthy young men without any families.
[01:50:45.599 --> 01:50:53.223]  And time and time again, we have seen them act violently against the native population with very little repercussions from the law.
[01:50:53.883 --> 01:51:04.934]  As we are expecting the announcement of Disease X and another lockdown, a recent report from UK's Jim Ferguson provides a plausible explanation of what we are seeing.
[01:51:05.334 --> 01:51:06.155]  This isn't normal.
[01:51:06.235 --> 01:51:07.176]  There's something not right.
[01:51:07.196 --> 01:51:09.338]  This isn't just refugees coming in.
[01:51:09.498 --> 01:51:11.761]  These aren't people fleeing from some kind of war zone.
[01:51:11.841 --> 01:51:15.244]  These are predominantly men aged between 25 and 35.
[01:51:17.586 --> 01:51:22.577]  Young, fighting-age men, as my old boss Nigel Farage once referred to them, and I think he's right.
[01:51:23.018 --> 01:51:24.521]  John, what do you think's going on here, mate?
[01:51:25.097 --> 01:51:31.960]  So I can tell you these are UN soldiers and they will be deployed by the WHO when they announce the next pandemic lockdown.
[01:51:32.300 --> 01:51:33.200]  That's what's going to happen.
[01:51:33.541 --> 01:51:35.381]  They've been trained by British soldiers.
[01:51:35.561 --> 01:51:38.102]  They've been trained by the Black Watch Regiment.
[01:51:38.122 --> 01:51:43.024]  They were training them in Antalya in Turkey and in the east of Ukraine.
[01:51:43.205 --> 01:51:45.385]  They're predominantly down to sergeant ranks.
[01:51:45.425 --> 01:51:46.666]  They're then shipped to France.
[01:51:47.046 --> 01:51:48.847]  They all sign the Official Secrets Act.
[01:51:49.347 --> 01:51:50.407]  Then they're ferried over.
[01:51:50.608 --> 01:51:56.009]  If you were fleeing war and tyranny, I don't know about you, but I would certainly take my wife and children with me.
[01:51:56.069 --> 01:51:57.270]  They're most precious.
[01:51:57.650 --> 01:51:58.790]  They're my prized asset.
[01:51:59.310 --> 01:52:00.571]  You know, they're everything to me.
[01:52:00.911 --> 01:52:03.152]  If you're going to war, you go to war with the lads.
[01:52:03.612 --> 01:52:04.752]  They're gonna be deployed.
[01:52:04.792 --> 01:52:05.753]  They will be deployed.
[01:52:05.953 --> 01:52:07.933]  Sean, I mean, you say you spoke to people on the Black Watch.
[01:52:08.013 --> 01:52:09.474]  I mean, the Black Watch are very famous.
[01:52:10.313 --> 01:52:10.593]  Yeah, no.
[01:52:10.773 --> 01:52:11.153]  Regiment.
[01:52:11.974 --> 01:52:13.674]  Are they actually going along with this?
[01:52:14.114 --> 01:52:14.935]  They've got no choice.
[01:52:15.495 --> 01:52:17.116]  I kind of said, you know, why are you doing it?
[01:52:17.136 --> 01:52:18.516]  And he said, soldiers follow orders.
[01:52:18.836 --> 01:52:20.597]  What you're going to see is the following.
[01:52:20.617 --> 01:52:29.200]  We'll have a minister somewhere in cabinets suddenly come up with a great idea on how we're going to get these guys to contribute to help us.
[01:52:29.619 --> 01:52:33.380]   and they're going to put them in uniforms. I saw a couple of people have told me these uniforms are
[01:52:33.380 --> 01:52:38.739]   burgundy, others have told me they're UN blue. I really don't know, I guess we'll see when they
[01:52:38.739 --> 01:52:43.859]   deploy them. They are going to be deployed because otherwise if they announced another lockdown what
[01:52:43.859 --> 01:52:48.019]   would everyone say? They'd say bollocks and they'd go about their business wouldn't they? They're
[01:52:48.019 --> 01:52:54.338]   going to need armed young men in uniform to try and enforce it. Why do they import young men from
[01:52:54.826 --> 01:53:00.950]  Because traditionally, if you want to kill and tyrannize white people, you put black soldiers in.
[01:53:00.970 --> 01:53:03.172]  Because there's a cultural disassociation.
[01:53:03.672 --> 01:53:04.873]  And that's their method.
[01:53:04.953 --> 01:53:06.974]  That's the way these globalists are going to do it.
[01:53:07.054 --> 01:53:16.241]   You know, in America, When it was a colony of the United Kingdom, of Britain, there was a revolution against British colonial rule.
[01:53:16.621 --> 01:53:17.101]  That's right.
[01:53:17.662 --> 01:53:29.692]  And, you know, a lot of people didn't realise, but it was only 3% of those people in America that overthrew the British forces and basically got rid of them.
[01:53:30.753 --> 01:53:31.833]  3% of the population, John.
[01:53:32.054 --> 01:53:33.014]  I look forward to it.
[01:53:33.155 --> 01:53:33.555]  I'm ready.
[01:53:34.227 --> 01:53:34.667]  I'm ready.
[01:53:34.747 --> 01:53:37.748]  I can't wait because I know it's going to be the beginning of the end for them.
[01:53:38.148 --> 01:53:39.309]  I do foresee victory.
[01:53:39.329 --> 01:53:41.930]  I see that at very great cost.
[01:53:42.250 --> 01:53:43.130]  But we will see it.
[01:53:43.450 --> 01:53:48.692]  And people, I think the world will become closer than ever when we do see victory.
[01:53:48.772 --> 01:53:52.033]  It's going to come on the back of a loaded bloodshed and unfortunately it has to.
[01:53:52.353 --> 01:53:58.875]  Once people of all colours come together and recognise their common enemy, we'll walk over these people in 10 minutes.
[01:53:59.279 --> 01:54:02.079]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:54:02.079 --> 01:54:06.158]   Of course, that person reporting on that blowing the whistle is the very famous coroner in the UK
[01:54:06.158 --> 01:54:10.399]   that has been documented for three years exposing the mass death, now all confirmed.
[01:54:10.399 --> 01:54:14.159]   We'll be right back with the founder of the most evil organization on earth.
[01:54:14.159 --> 01:54:17.759]   All right, I remember interviewing this guy during the lockdowns three years ago,
[01:54:17.759 --> 01:54:20.880]   and then during the attack on trucker protests two years ago,
[01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:26.798]   Jeremy McKenzie, just a well-spoken, nice, friendly guy, 14-year combat veteran of
[01:54:26.798 --> 01:54:30.679]   in the infantry and served in Afghanistan and he's now an entertainer and a political
[01:54:31.278 --> 01:54:34.139]  RagingDissident.com.
[01:54:34.179 --> 01:54:35.299]  RagingDissident.com.
[01:54:35.639 --> 01:54:35.979]  One word.
[01:54:36.659 --> 01:54:43.901]  Well, my goodness, in the last month, and I barely covered this, it's been like the number one campaign issue of the embattled Trudeau.
[01:54:43.921 --> 01:54:49.402]  He's got like 20% support right now in the Parliament, but the election's still like a year off.
[01:54:50.376 --> 01:54:56.899]  He just says, man, Alex Jones is a dangerous extremist, and Diagonalon is like this evil, threatening group.
[01:54:57.259 --> 01:55:02.901]  Well, Diagonalon is a joke term, according to the news, that Jerry McKenzie came up with.
[01:55:04.241 --> 01:55:10.444]  So, people say, well, why do you care about Canada so much when there's only 30 million people or whatever it is, 35 million people?
[01:55:11.684 --> 01:55:13.185]  Well, because it's a globalist outpost.
[01:55:13.204 --> 01:55:18.364]   Klaus Schwab said the example of their takeover of the world and penetrating the cabinets
[01:55:18.364 --> 01:55:19.364]  is Justin Trudeau.
[01:55:19.364 --> 01:55:21.164]  He's the guy that said, "I want to be a dictator.
[01:55:21.164 --> 01:55:22.364]  I like dictatorships."
[01:55:22.364 --> 01:55:23.364]  He's the guy that said, "Oh, I took the shot.
[01:55:23.364 --> 01:55:24.364]  It feels so good."
[01:55:24.364 --> 01:55:27.644]   He's the one that said, "You cannot take the shot, but you can't leave your house."
[01:55:27.644 --> 01:55:30.005]  He's a tyrant.
[01:55:30.005 --> 01:55:38.125]   And if people are enslaved in Australia or Germany or Canada or Nigeria, am I saying
[01:55:38.125 --> 01:55:39.125]  they're enslaved in Nigeria?
[01:55:39.152 --> 01:55:47.713]  My point is, anywhere, that is an issue for all of us, especially when the same multinational globalist group is financing it and admitting it's a beta test for us.
[01:55:48.594 --> 01:55:56.675]  All the same laws, all the same regulations you see all over the Western world, the Internet IDs, the Central Bank Digital Currencies, the ESGs, it's all the same group.
[01:55:58.096 --> 01:56:12.524]   The globalists, BlackRock, the WEF, So, it shows how desperate Trudeau is, where the Conservative Party's got 40-something percent, he's got 20, and then the rest fill up the other, you know, 30 percent or so.
[01:56:13.224 --> 01:56:14.965]  You know, why is the Conservative Party in power?
[01:56:14.985 --> 01:56:16.165]  Well, it's a parliament, folks.
[01:56:16.906 --> 01:56:21.448]  So, he can do coalition governments, Trudeau can't, but he doesn't even have a coalition right now.
[01:56:22.268 --> 01:56:30.474]  So this is a big deal, and the globalists are really trying to prop him up, trying to pass laws that our guest warned of years ago, Jerry McKenzie.
[01:56:30.894 --> 01:56:34.757]  They're trying to arrest him for speech, saying they're going to try to outlaw speech.
[01:56:34.777 --> 01:56:40.241]  Well, now they've got legislation introduced to retroactively arrest you for politically incorrect speech.
[01:56:40.821 --> 01:56:43.743]  So this is like North Korea coming to North America.
[01:56:44.124 --> 01:56:45.064]  This is a big deal.
[01:56:45.324 --> 01:56:46.465]  Here's a short compilation.
[01:56:46.525 --> 01:56:47.226]  Believe me, it's short.
[01:56:47.286 --> 01:56:48.146]  We've got hours of this.
[01:56:48.527 --> 01:56:56.189]   Trudeau, in almost every speech for a month, or more than a month, Is literally saying, Jeremy McKenzie, Diagonal On, Alex Jones, they're going to get you.
[01:56:56.229 --> 01:56:57.149]  They're hiding under the table.
[01:56:57.169 --> 01:56:57.649]  They're everywhere.
[01:56:57.669 --> 01:56:58.369]  They're so dangerous.
[01:56:58.429 --> 01:56:59.170]  It's an extremist group.
[01:56:59.370 --> 01:57:00.050]  It's a terror group.
[01:57:00.350 --> 01:57:01.770]  I think I'm playing a lawsuit against Trudeau.
[01:57:01.790 --> 01:57:03.190]  I mean, it's just insane.
[01:57:03.890 --> 01:57:06.751]  And then Diagonal On is like a joke you made.
[01:57:06.831 --> 01:57:09.312]  So that shows how ridiculous they are.
[01:57:09.352 --> 01:57:19.314]  The real threat is Trudeau, the WF, the UN, the climate power grabs, the UN local government, the housing prices exploding, the forced shots, all of that.
[01:57:19.614 --> 01:57:26.826]   But we're told That this evil man, Jeremy McKenzie and Alex Jones, are the reason that you should vote for Trudeau.
[01:57:26.846 --> 01:57:27.867]  It's definitely not working.
[01:57:28.287 --> 01:57:29.328]  Canadians are rejecting it.
[01:57:29.348 --> 01:57:29.709]  Here it is.
[01:57:30.590 --> 01:58:03.860]   Speaking of misinformation and disinformation, any responsible leader that receives an endorsement and support from proven conspiracy theorist and liar Alex Jones would have immediately Are they the kind of leader that is going to exacerbate divisions, fears, and polarization in our country, make personal attacks, and welcome the support of conspiracy theorists and extremists?
[01:58:03.940 --> 01:58:11.125]  Because that's exactly what Pierre Poliev continues to do, not just when you see him engaging with members of Diagonalon.
[01:58:13.001 --> 01:58:22.330]  But also when he refuses to condemn and reject the endorsement of Alex Jones.
[01:58:23.631 --> 01:58:33.820]  Alex Jones is a proven liar and conspiracy theorist towards the kind of lies that Alex Jones is peddling still.
[01:58:35.562 --> 01:58:42.324]   If Pierre Polyev wanted to be a responsible leader, I'll even give him the words.
[01:58:43.225 --> 01:58:44.346]  This is what he should say.
[01:58:47.709 --> 01:58:56.877]  I reject, categorically, the endorsement and the support of Diagonal On and of Alex Jones.
[01:58:57.778 --> 01:59:03.664]  Because Diagonal On is a violent, white nationalist organization.
[01:59:04.992 --> 01:59:08.035]  And Alex Jones is a garbage conspiracy theorist.
[01:59:08.696 --> 01:59:20.727]  On top of that, he's spending time with far-right nationalist groups and refusing to condemn them or garbage conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones because he wants their votes.
[01:59:21.748 --> 01:59:22.269]  Think about it.
[01:59:22.289 --> 01:59:23.310]  Are you excited?
[01:59:23.670 --> 01:59:25.670]  I am very excited.
[01:59:25.670 --> 01:59:37.182]   Getting that shot really was an amazing feeling it It hits you.
[01:59:37.202 --> 01:59:38.742]  Okay, number one, your honor.
[01:59:39.703 --> 01:59:40.463]  Just look at him.
[01:59:40.963 --> 01:59:44.544]  He talks like a bi too.
[01:59:49.241 --> 01:59:52.363]  And then we've got him saying he wants a basic... What do you admire most?
[01:59:52.383 --> 01:59:52.803]  What government?
[01:59:52.843 --> 01:59:54.825]  I love Xi Jinping and China's basic dictatorship.
[01:59:55.305 --> 01:59:55.905]  That's a quote.
[01:59:55.925 --> 01:59:56.586]  In fact, pull that up.
[01:59:56.666 --> 01:59:57.406]  I asked that to be in the clip.
[01:59:57.426 --> 01:59:57.667]  It's not.
[01:59:57.707 --> 01:59:58.167]  I'm not mad.
[01:59:58.527 --> 01:59:59.508]  But I want to just quote that.
[01:59:59.808 --> 02:00:02.430]  Most of you have seen it, but I don't like to make a claim like that and not show it.
[02:00:02.930 --> 02:00:04.131]  So, I've interviewed you a few times.
[02:00:04.151 --> 02:00:05.092]  You've been on the other shows.
[02:00:05.652 --> 02:00:07.013]  You're a funny, smart guy.
[02:00:07.433 --> 02:00:10.375]  You predicted they were going to start arresting people before they attacked the truckers.
[02:00:10.875 --> 02:00:13.057]  You predicted they would try to outlaw what you were doing.
[02:00:13.077 --> 02:00:14.358]  You made a joke about Diagonal On.
[02:00:15.358 --> 02:00:19.840]  To me it shows how pathetically weak he is, as like the poster boy of the New World Order.
[02:00:21.621 --> 02:00:22.581]  I'm busy, you're busy.
[02:00:22.641 --> 02:00:27.563]  I told the crew, hey get me three or four clips of Tag and Diagonal on Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.583 --> 02:00:33.566]  They didn't get the one where he calls you guys a terror group, I'm sure you've seen it, and says you're dangerous and to the country.
[02:00:33.586 --> 02:00:35.267]  I mean that's pure defamation.
[02:00:36.107 --> 02:00:53.526]  Tell us who you are, for people that don't remember who you are, people that aren't in Canada, and then how you and I have been singled out as the boogeyman here, because I'm quite honored, actually, and it looks like it's not working, because up here, Polyam shows up at a rally, and there's one Diagonal on flag, and they go, oh God, he's with Diagonal on, oh my God, hide under the bed.
[02:00:54.887 --> 02:01:02.475]  It was a doodle that, you know, my girl Morgan drew on the side of a door two years ago in amongst the protests in Ottawa.
[02:01:02.515 --> 02:01:05.899]  It was, you know, totally meaningless and just a silly thing.
[02:01:05.919 --> 02:01:06.679]  David, admit that.
[02:01:06.699 --> 02:01:07.841]  So why are they so scared of it?
[02:01:07.861 --> 02:01:09.402]  I mean, explain what happened in detail.
[02:01:09.422 --> 02:01:11.224]  You're the evil founder.
[02:01:11.284 --> 02:01:14.828]  Your girlfriend or girl is the founder of the most dangerous group in Canada.
[02:01:14.848 --> 02:01:15.369]  Tell us about it.
[02:01:15.962 --> 02:01:16.182]  Right.
[02:01:16.623 --> 02:01:18.444]  Well, first of all, thanks for having me back, Alex.
[02:01:18.464 --> 02:01:19.064]  I appreciate it.
[02:01:19.084 --> 02:01:26.490]  Yeah, it's been a wild ride over the few years, and I appreciate your attention and coverage to this issue, because very few people have been following up what's going on here in Canada.
[02:01:26.530 --> 02:01:33.715]   And to your point, why it's important, or why it should concern American voters and citizens especially, is because we're We're right next door.
[02:01:33.935 --> 02:01:42.779]  There's a lot of land and space here, and there's a lot of people that are filing in here every day, over a million and change per year, and they're not going to be pleasant neighbors in the future.
[02:01:42.819 --> 02:01:46.421]  So as this place devolves and falls apart, it's going to be a security problem.
[02:01:46.441 --> 02:01:47.842]  It's going to be an issue for the United States.
[02:01:49.123 --> 02:01:52.244]  But as it goes, for myself and Diagonal, it was a joke.
[02:01:52.544 --> 02:01:53.805]  It's all over the iconography.
[02:01:53.845 --> 02:01:55.306]  It's just branding symbolism, really.
[02:01:55.726 --> 02:02:02.493]   As a fan club for my podcast, and a collection of other guys, you've got Alex Wren, the ferryman's soul, Derek Harrison, And, you know, others.
[02:02:02.874 --> 02:02:11.437]  There's, you know, a few of us and we're just basically regular Canadian guys that were taken to the Internet to express ourselves and our views and our frustrations and our concerns over what's happening in the country.
[02:02:11.477 --> 02:02:21.442]  And amongst this, we saw, well, all of the mandates are applied to all of these different states and provinces, and except for these ones, it formed kind of a diagonal, like, diaspora from Alaska to Florida.
[02:02:21.482 --> 02:02:30.286]  And we've just created this kind of a fake meme-running joke gag of a, well, if they're going to live in a parallel reality where good is bad and up is down, then we'll live in a fantasy world, too.
[02:02:30.346 --> 02:02:30.946]  And it's this one.
[02:02:31.735 --> 02:02:32.696]  And it's just going to evolve out of that.
[02:02:32.716 --> 02:02:35.919]  Exactly, but they're scared of narratives, so you create your own fantasy world and they're threatened by it.
[02:02:36.860 --> 02:02:39.102]  Guys, pull up the map of Diagon Alley, because that's right.
[02:02:39.142 --> 02:02:41.824]  It's just, you know, look, there's states that are free.
[02:02:41.864 --> 02:02:42.405]  Isn't that funny?
[02:02:42.445 --> 02:02:43.126]  What's happening here?
[02:02:43.546 --> 02:02:46.569]  Because it is just the middle of the country from Canada down and over to Florida.
[02:02:47.373 --> 02:02:47.553]  Right.
[02:02:47.934 --> 02:03:03.929]  And where the issue came is where, you know, one of those guys I mentioned, Alex, was actually traveling the country and kind of stitching people together and I launched what I'd call a Find Your Friends campaign based on some, you know, good advice I'd received from another friend where it was a quote from an old German philosopher or somebody, just find the others.
[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:05.601]  And that really struck me.
[02:03:05.841 --> 02:03:11.984]  We started getting some get-togethers and I saw people, one of our first ones, out in the middle of the prairies and 40, 50 people came from all over the country.
[02:03:12.044 --> 02:03:13.965]  Most of them never knew each other except from over the internet.
[02:03:14.586 --> 02:03:15.826]  And this is in the middle of the pandemic.
[02:03:15.846 --> 02:03:16.547]  They had a great time.
[02:03:16.607 --> 02:03:17.487]  Everybody was smiling.
[02:03:17.507 --> 02:03:17.988]  They were drinking.
[02:03:18.048 --> 02:03:20.429]  I was kind of, you know, this could go badly, but it was amazing.
[02:03:20.449 --> 02:03:24.451]  People had tears in their eyes because they'd been so isolated and gaslit and punished by their own people.
[02:03:24.551 --> 02:03:27.873]  For folks that don't know, Canada was much worse than the U.S.
[02:03:27.913 --> 02:03:29.134]  I mean, it was serious lockdowns.
[02:03:30.521 --> 02:03:32.924]  Yeah, and it persisted for the majority of the time.
[02:03:32.964 --> 02:03:37.129]  So we started doing this and we started encouraging people to come out and find each other and get together and network and all this.
[02:03:37.549 --> 02:03:41.894]  So what happened was, our esteemed colleagues... You know why they're scared, though?
[02:03:41.954 --> 02:03:43.596]  That could be a new country, actually.
[02:03:43.616 --> 02:03:45.298]  According to the demographics of politics.
[02:03:45.678 --> 02:03:47.561]  That's actually the new country right there!
[02:03:49.522 --> 02:03:50.462]  I would be fine with it.
[02:03:50.542 --> 02:03:51.423]  I would be all into it.
[02:03:51.703 --> 02:03:52.604]  I like this idea.
[02:03:52.624 --> 02:03:55.285]  I mean, I'm from the East Coast, but I'm not married to it by any means.
[02:03:55.326 --> 02:03:57.707]  I mean, if you guys are coming with us, I'll take that deal for sure.
[02:03:58.528 --> 02:04:03.191]  But our enemies at the Canadian Anti-Hate Network is who really laid the groundwork.
[02:04:03.231 --> 02:04:05.432]  And don't you love how they've made it powerful now?
[02:04:05.792 --> 02:04:06.393]  It's a joke.
[02:04:07.429 --> 02:04:13.472]  Yes, they're actually feeding us more energy by doing this, by giving us more attention and building us up to be this malevolent force of destruction.
[02:04:13.532 --> 02:04:18.434]  It legitimizes us in the eyes of everyone, at least as someone who's to be, you know, on the field.
[02:04:18.695 --> 02:04:20.135]  You're there to be discussed.
[02:04:20.175 --> 02:04:22.797]  The worst thing they ever did was pay attention to us, but they couldn't resist themselves.
[02:04:22.817 --> 02:04:23.597]  They needed a boogeyman.
[02:04:24.057 --> 02:04:24.577]  That's what they did.
[02:04:24.637 --> 02:04:26.237]  They're the Canadian version of the ADL.
[02:04:27.078 --> 02:04:30.518]  They're Jewish supremacists, and they've been after me, you know, since the very beginning.
[02:04:31.118 --> 02:04:39.820]  The CEO, Bernie Farber, is the guy who actually helped, along with Richard Warman and others, author this insane legislation to be put forward on the House of Commons.
[02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:45.041]  They tried a few years ago, but the election, you know... Yeah, let's talk about that, because I read it last week.
[02:04:45.241 --> 02:04:47.421]  Elon Musk tweeted it, or reposted it.
[02:04:47.881 --> 02:04:49.481]  Explain what Trudeau's trying to do.
[02:04:49.501 --> 02:04:50.742]  I mean, this is North Korea stuff.
[02:04:50.902 --> 02:04:52.362]  Folks, we can't exaggerate how bad it is.
[02:04:53.055 --> 02:04:54.476]  No, I wish I was exaggerating.
[02:04:54.516 --> 02:04:57.598]  Years ago when I said they were trying to do this, but I mean, oh gee, sorry.
[02:04:57.858 --> 02:05:05.803]  You know how, more than anyone I'm sure, that you can discover something and it sometimes takes two, three, four years later before it gets discovered by the mainstream and people pick up on what's happening.
[02:05:06.524 --> 02:05:08.365]  C-63 is kind of the name of the bill.
[02:05:08.385 --> 02:05:14.010]   The Online Harms Act was originally called the Anti-hate bill was it was when it hit the floor many years ago.
[02:05:14.351 --> 02:05:33.713]   Here's just some some brief highlights You can enlist the Canadian citizens in an ambitious social monitoring system rewards of up to $20,000 for anonymous informants of hateful behavior whatever that means with the guilty parties paying penalties of $50,000 so therefore itself it funds itself and We've got a national spying system of anonymous informants reporting on each other.
[02:05:34.714 --> 02:05:36.456]  Criminal penalties including life in prison.
[02:05:36.796 --> 02:05:41.761]  Not just for existing crimes like advocating genocide, but for any offense motivated by hatred.
[02:05:41.881 --> 02:05:42.842]  Once again, whatever that means.
[02:05:43.303 --> 02:05:45.825]  In theory, any non-criminal offense as tiny as littering.
[02:05:46.386 --> 02:05:48.008]  Littering committed with hateful intent.
[02:05:48.028 --> 02:05:52.551]   So you see guys going up putting up stickers saying, It's okay to be a white person, that's the sticker.
[02:05:52.691 --> 02:05:55.371]  Jail, we've already had people arrested for that in Calgary.
[02:05:55.391 --> 02:05:58.832]  That is littering with hateful intent apparently under this new legislation.
[02:05:59.112 --> 02:06:04.753]  Oh no, some of the Proud Boys got years in prison for tearing up a Black Lives Matter sign.
[02:06:05.634 --> 02:06:05.814]  Right.
[02:06:06.274 --> 02:06:09.254]  Yeah, it's all the same kind of, it's not crime is what it is.
[02:06:09.554 --> 02:06:18.388]   We've got minority report pre-crime style legislation where an informant, if they can convince a judge that you will commit a hate offense, Okay, so you're likely to.
[02:06:18.609 --> 02:06:25.099]  You can be jailed for up to a year, put under house arrest, have your firearm seized, be forced into drug and alcohol testing for things that haven't even happened.
[02:06:25.758 --> 02:06:27.800]  Uh, they can penalize you for things you've already said.
[02:06:27.860 --> 02:06:36.405]  The law can get around, uh, prohibitions against retroactive punishment because they call it what's called continuation of, uh, or continuous communication of hate.
[02:06:36.806 --> 02:06:39.327]  So the crime is your failure to take down bad speech.
[02:06:39.367 --> 02:06:45.792]  So if I say something on this broadcast, I can delete it on my end, but if you share it somewhere else and someone else shares it somewhere else, it's still on the internet.
[02:06:45.852 --> 02:06:48.273]  Therefore, it's a continuing communication of hate.
[02:06:48.333 --> 02:06:49.114]  So I'm still guilty.
[02:06:49.614 --> 02:06:57.037]  And then the last one, corporate internet platforms will be forced to remove harmful content on demand virtually within 24 hours in some cases.
[02:06:57.297 --> 02:07:00.438]  The hammer being fines of up to 6% of gross global revenue.
[02:07:00.638 --> 02:07:00.798]  Wow!
[02:07:00.818 --> 02:07:04.019]  I can't imagine Facebook or... Yeah, no one's gonna play ball for that.
[02:07:04.179 --> 02:07:07.240]  So it's similar to Brazil and Australia coming after Elon Musk.
[02:07:08.294 --> 02:07:08.474]  Yeah.
[02:07:08.934 --> 02:07:10.115]  So I mean, that's that's the end.
[02:07:10.155 --> 02:07:14.197]  I mean, this just shows how desperate they are, especially the current liberal regime, that they're coming after me.
[02:07:14.257 --> 02:07:16.778]  And you're like, what do you have to do with Canadian politics?
[02:07:17.058 --> 02:07:18.058]  This place is a dumpster fire.
[02:07:18.258 --> 02:07:20.199]  We've got a million migrants coming in every year.
[02:07:20.339 --> 02:07:21.620]  Violent crime is out of control.
[02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:23.181]  Drug overdoses are out of control.
[02:07:23.321 --> 02:07:24.281]  No one can afford food.
[02:07:24.341 --> 02:07:25.602]  No one can afford anywhere to live.
[02:07:26.062 --> 02:07:27.342]  It's scary everywhere.
[02:07:27.723 --> 02:07:28.743]  The women are terrified.
[02:07:28.783 --> 02:07:31.524]  There's people being attacked with blades and swords and killed.
[02:07:31.964 --> 02:07:34.125]  And oh, well, we've got a guy on the Internet.
[02:07:34.165 --> 02:07:35.326]  Mass overdoses.
[02:07:35.686 --> 02:07:38.549]  Mass overdosing and you made a joke about diagonal lines.
[02:07:38.629 --> 02:07:40.591]  So, it's actually a great idea.
[02:07:40.611 --> 02:07:43.053]  I'm not saying do it, but it's actually the most conservative.
[02:07:43.473 --> 02:07:44.935]  It's actually a really nice looking country.
[02:07:44.975 --> 02:07:47.117]  And you got the Pacific Ocean, you got the Atlantic.
[02:07:47.537 --> 02:07:50.520]  Hey, it's kind of, we always think about the Midwest.
[02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:51.781]  No, we just take the whole thing.
[02:07:52.302 --> 02:07:55.665]  And the left can sail on both coasts and we get the whole thing.
[02:07:56.964 --> 02:07:59.887]  The communist we refer to as Circulon, that's our immortal enemy.
[02:07:59.907 --> 02:08:00.688]  They're on the coast.
[02:08:00.748 --> 02:08:03.070]  They're in California, they're in New York, they're in Exxon.
[02:08:03.250 --> 02:08:04.311]  And we have all the nuclear weapons.
[02:08:04.331 --> 02:08:05.292]  That's why they're scared, though.
[02:08:05.312 --> 02:08:07.514]  I actually support Diagonalon, not as a joke.
[02:08:09.015 --> 02:08:13.560]  I want to actually... I could drive from Florida all the way to Alaska.
[02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:14.861]  Perfect.
[02:08:15.121 --> 02:08:19.725]  On our new transcontinental superhighway that we're... high-speed rail train that Elon Musk is going to build us, I'm sure.
[02:08:19.745 --> 02:08:21.447]  He'll be the first president of Diagonalon.
[02:08:22.878 --> 02:08:23.979]  Sure, I mean, I'm open to it.
[02:08:23.999 --> 02:08:24.879]  We can have some discussions.
[02:08:24.899 --> 02:08:26.820]  He'll have to compete with Philip, our emperor.
[02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:30.522]  It's a demonic goat figurine from a trans-dimensional fortress of chaos.
[02:08:30.542 --> 02:08:31.322]  Let's get serious.
[02:08:33.643 --> 02:08:36.805]  Let's talk about where this is really going, though, because they're in full panic mode.
[02:08:36.825 --> 02:08:39.186]  You're military guys, you've got a great background.
[02:08:40.266 --> 02:08:43.068]  Look, we can make jokes all day and it's fun to do it, but they're not going to give up.
[02:08:43.088 --> 02:08:44.428]  They're going to try something really serious.
[02:08:44.929 --> 02:08:47.090]  In Canada, everywhere, they're in full panic mode.
[02:08:47.110 --> 02:08:47.910]  What do you think they're going to do?
[02:08:49.597 --> 02:08:50.978]  Well, they'll go as far as they can take it.
[02:08:51.438 --> 02:08:54.019]  I'm not confident this legislation is going to pass.
[02:08:54.039 --> 02:08:56.700]  I think we're going to have an election soon and it's going to get tossed anyway.
[02:08:57.160 --> 02:08:58.721]  But that's not really the issue.
[02:08:58.741 --> 02:09:04.863]  The issue is that this was able to hit the floor and barely a yawn.
[02:09:04.883 --> 02:09:06.024]  This should be a national crisis.
[02:09:06.344 --> 02:09:08.925]  The fact that we have a Canadian, apparently, government.
[02:09:09.105 --> 02:09:11.166]  Trudeau is trying to become a dictator.
[02:09:12.286 --> 02:09:13.927]  Even Mainstream Media said it's dictatorial.
[02:09:15.413 --> 02:09:26.216]  Well, they have their, and I kind of, listening in a little bit earlier when you were talking about it, there's just captured by a spirit of malevolence, and you can say whatever, maybe there's a secret of AI somewhere controlling people, it's the spirit of Lucifer, so I don't know what it is.
[02:09:26.596 --> 02:09:33.297]  But all of these people have subscribed to this idea that they're right no matter what happens, and you have to conform to their belief system, or else they will hurt you.
[02:09:33.857 --> 02:09:38.299]  And that's how it's been for years, and it's only becoming more and more advanced and more masked off.
[02:09:38.339 --> 02:09:39.899]  You saw it in Ottawa, I warned these people.
[02:09:40.419 --> 02:09:49.943]  And it wasn't because I'm a psychic, it's because I had friends from my military service that are now in or had in the orbit of the police, you know, apparatus saying, we're sending the riot squads and we're going to beat the shit out of everybody.
[02:09:50.764 --> 02:09:52.785]  And I told them that, and they said, oh, that would never happen.
[02:09:52.825 --> 02:09:55.746]  You said that weeks before it happened, and I said, come on, really?
[02:09:55.806 --> 02:09:57.127]  And it happened.
[02:09:57.487 --> 02:09:57.647]  Yeah.
[02:09:58.755 --> 02:09:59.715]  Well, because they were planning it.
[02:09:59.755 --> 02:10:01.296]  They brought in the public order unit.
[02:10:01.316 --> 02:10:03.416]  They were training and doing rehearsals down by the airport.
[02:10:03.436 --> 02:10:04.696]  You know, you could drive by and see them.
[02:10:04.716 --> 02:10:05.657]  Guys were going by, look, there they are.
[02:10:05.677 --> 02:10:06.537]  What do you think they're here to do?
[02:10:06.597 --> 02:10:07.297]  Give out flowers?
[02:10:08.237 --> 02:10:11.758]  I was thinking of the old floor, the old Canada, when you were on a few times.
[02:10:12.318 --> 02:10:15.479]  I was like, come on, they're not going to really ride over folks with horses.
[02:10:15.499 --> 02:10:16.279]  You predicted that.
[02:10:16.599 --> 02:10:19.240]  And then weeks later, they did it because you're military, you're watching it happen.
[02:10:20.222 --> 02:10:22.723]  Yeah, they just had no other way out and they weren't going to negotiate.
[02:10:22.743 --> 02:10:24.204]  They weren't looking for a way to talk to people.
[02:10:24.224 --> 02:10:27.586]  They were just looking to make it go away and that's the fastest way to do it is just the iron boot.
[02:10:28.066 --> 02:10:30.007]  And they would, you know, cut all the footage.
[02:10:30.027 --> 02:10:38.931]  They didn't show any, not on mainstream, but there's hours and hours of footage of women being beaten and trampled with horses kicked in the face, veterans being butt-stroked in the head, guys having their medals ripped.
[02:10:38.951 --> 02:10:40.472]  I mean, it was the most disgusting thing I've ever seen.
[02:10:40.492 --> 02:10:44.514]  And these cops had their name tags and everything removed so they couldn't be identified, which is a crime, by the way.
[02:10:44.854 --> 02:10:46.515]  So this government likes to commit crimes.
[02:10:46.555 --> 02:10:46.975]  It doesn't matter.
[02:10:47.015 --> 02:10:49.596]  If anyone's a terrorist in this country, it's the Liberal government of Canada.
[02:10:49.676 --> 02:10:51.659]  The government of Canada is a terrorist organization.
[02:10:51.959 --> 02:10:56.405]  It's been deplatforming people, it's been silencing people, taking their bank accounts, putting people in prison.
[02:10:56.425 --> 02:10:59.430]  There's still people in prison for these demonstrations in Cootes, Alberta right now!
[02:10:59.750 --> 02:11:03.776]  They're waiting trial two years later for something that they can never even really...
[02:11:04.642 --> 02:11:05.964]  How's the enemy going to strike back first?
[02:11:05.984 --> 02:11:07.606]  But then let's talk about Pierre Pogliep.
[02:11:07.746 --> 02:11:09.769]  Pogliep, however you say it.
[02:11:09.809 --> 02:11:13.034]  When I came out and said, hey, he looks better than Trudeau.
[02:11:13.094 --> 02:11:13.735]  I hate Trudeau.
[02:11:13.795 --> 02:11:14.756]  I know he's not perfect.
[02:11:15.037 --> 02:11:17.400]  Then I got attacked by a bunch of Canadians saying, no, he's a horrible globalist.
[02:11:17.981 --> 02:11:20.144]  All I'm just saying is, he sounds a lot better than Trudeau.
[02:11:20.224 --> 02:11:21.566]  So is he good or is he bad?
[02:11:22.674 --> 02:11:23.155]  Sure.
[02:11:23.295 --> 02:11:24.617]  I'm of the opinion that he's the same.
[02:11:24.777 --> 02:11:26.519]  I mean, he's just a career politician.
[02:11:26.579 --> 02:11:27.961]  He's been in politics his entire life.
[02:11:28.041 --> 02:11:28.942]  That's what he's always done.
[02:11:28.982 --> 02:11:30.784]  He just went to school and got right into it.
[02:11:30.825 --> 02:11:32.507]  And he's been on, he's been right there the whole way.
[02:11:32.547 --> 02:11:33.628]  I mean, it's one side or the other.
[02:11:33.648 --> 02:11:34.910]  Left foot, right foot.
[02:11:34.950 --> 02:11:37.333]  It's the two-step, you know, walking, you know, bird.
[02:11:37.353 --> 02:11:40.517]  Sure, so they claim you're his main army and you don't even support him.
[02:11:41.630 --> 02:11:42.511]  No, I absolutely don't.
[02:11:42.531 --> 02:11:44.873]  I don't think anyone's a bigger critic of him in this country than me.
[02:11:44.933 --> 02:11:48.976]  If there is someone that's more critical of him than me, I'd like to meet them, but I don't think there is.
[02:11:49.357 --> 02:11:52.740]  So this is just a desperate attempt by them to smear the- So what does Cameron do?
[02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:55.242]  If I'm wrong about Pierre, then what do we do?
[02:11:58.576 --> 02:12:00.838]  Well, yeah, that's kind of what we've been doing.
[02:12:00.878 --> 02:12:01.459]  Find your friends.
[02:12:01.779 --> 02:12:05.863]  It's the people versus the state at this point, because we don't have a dog in there.
[02:12:05.923 --> 02:12:07.264]  Not in Canada, anyway.
[02:12:07.925 --> 02:12:10.187]  It's entirely ideologically captured by the same thing.
[02:12:10.227 --> 02:12:12.869]  They're all on board with all the same ideas.
[02:12:13.530 --> 02:12:16.352]  And at the end of the day, I think the Conservatives will probably end up being worse.
[02:12:16.813 --> 02:12:27.563]   I don't know if they'll enact this kind of legislation, but they've already The tools that the Liberal government is using now against people like me and my friends and other people such as yourself was put into place by the Conservative government in previous years.
[02:12:27.603 --> 02:12:31.586]  So what's happened is people are just really angry at the Prime Minister and the regime.
[02:12:31.606 --> 02:12:32.647]  They don't like the direction things are going.
[02:12:32.687 --> 02:12:38.433]  This is always the direction it's been going, but it's natural human instinct that you point to the guy at the top, he must be the king and the emperor.
[02:12:38.473 --> 02:12:40.875]  If we just get rid of him and put another guy in, everything will be fine.
[02:12:41.275 --> 02:12:46.237]  And they don't see that it's just a toxic cancerous tumor that reaches out all over the place.
[02:12:46.257 --> 02:12:47.198]  Well, let me ask you this.
[02:12:47.438 --> 02:12:48.438]  Is Trudeau retarded?
[02:12:48.518 --> 02:12:51.780]  Because he literally says, I love dictators.
[02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:52.900]  I love G.G.Ping.
[02:12:53.460 --> 02:12:54.581]  He says, oh, I love the shot.
[02:12:54.601 --> 02:12:55.181]  It's so great.
[02:12:55.221 --> 02:12:56.101]  I'm going to arrest everybody.
[02:12:56.121 --> 02:12:59.403]  I mean, he's like a cartoon retarded dictator.
[02:12:59.503 --> 02:13:00.723]  I mean, what is his problem?
[02:13:01.684 --> 02:13:02.484]  I think he's honest.
[02:13:02.544 --> 02:13:03.745]  I think he believes what he says.
[02:13:03.765 --> 02:13:05.945]  I think he actually believes the things that he says and he does.
[02:13:05.965 --> 02:13:07.446]  And that's, you know, he has the energy for it.
[02:13:07.526 --> 02:13:08.446]  I don't think it's an act.
[02:13:08.487 --> 02:13:09.127]  I don't think it's a.
[02:13:10.174 --> 02:13:12.675]  You know, playing a part, I think he really has bought all this stuff in.
[02:13:12.695 --> 02:13:15.157]  So he's a useful idiot at Klaus Schwab?
[02:13:15.437 --> 02:13:16.197]  He's a useful idiot?
[02:13:16.257 --> 02:13:16.677]  I think so.
[02:13:17.398 --> 02:13:17.798]  I think so.
[02:13:17.838 --> 02:13:19.939]  I think he believes... Like, I heard a story about him.
[02:13:20.199 --> 02:13:23.441]  I'm not going to say from who, but someone that knows him and, you know, spent time with him.
[02:13:23.461 --> 02:13:26.882]  He was really worried about the carbon footprint of a fire that they had when they were out camping.
[02:13:26.902 --> 02:13:28.143]  This was, you know, many years ago.
[02:13:28.183 --> 02:13:30.644]  So he's, I think he's a true believer in all of this stuff.
[02:13:30.664 --> 02:13:31.925]  So that's kind of dangerous.
[02:13:31.965 --> 02:13:34.746]  But he'll tell you, at least with the liberals, they'll tell you.
[02:13:34.766 --> 02:13:36.147]  They'll say, we're going to mass vaccinate you.
[02:13:36.167 --> 02:13:37.028]  We're going to take your guns.
[02:13:37.308 --> 02:13:38.248]  We're going to censor your speech.
[02:13:38.268 --> 02:13:39.008]  We're going to, they'll do it.
[02:13:39.069 --> 02:13:39.969]  And they do all these things.
[02:13:40.302 --> 02:13:47.189]  The Conservative Party, on the other hand, in my experience, in my whole life, has always said, I'm your friend with one hand and the knife comes in the back on the other side.
[02:13:47.709 --> 02:14:04.726]  So this from the Field Marshal of the Conservative Party, the military, like the, I guess we'd call you the Desert Fox, the Erwin Rommel of Pierre Polyev, but you're not saying you're with him.
[02:14:05.729 --> 02:14:07.049]  No, no, absolutely not.
[02:14:07.549 --> 02:14:08.950]  I don't support politicians.
[02:14:08.970 --> 02:14:10.670]  I don't support career politicians especially.
[02:14:10.710 --> 02:14:12.671]  I think they're self-interested.
[02:14:12.731 --> 02:14:13.391]  They're parasites.
[02:14:13.431 --> 02:14:16.492]  The whole game and the whole thing is rigged against the people of this country.
[02:14:16.512 --> 02:14:18.492]  They're richer than they've ever been, Alex.
[02:14:18.512 --> 02:14:20.753]  The United States has the richest politicians in history.
[02:14:20.973 --> 02:14:22.133]  Canada's got the second richest.
[02:14:22.233 --> 02:14:23.814]  All these people are richer than they've ever been.
[02:14:24.094 --> 02:14:26.034]  And all of our people are poorer than they've ever been.
[02:14:26.314 --> 02:14:33.196]  But trust us, we just have to give them more money and more time and more support and make the government even bigger and keep doing more of the same and somehow things will get better.
[02:14:33.756 --> 02:14:39.439]  How do we know that Pierre Polyev is not a clone of the Speaker of the House?
[02:14:39.459 --> 02:14:40.240]  He kind of looks like him.
[02:14:41.420 --> 02:14:43.862]  Well, he does kind of look like Xi Jinping.
[02:14:43.922 --> 02:14:45.182]  He should put the glasses back on.
[02:14:45.202 --> 02:14:46.323]  I don't think it's doing him any favors.
[02:14:46.363 --> 02:14:47.324]  I started making fun of him.
[02:14:47.684 --> 02:14:48.324]  I had an impression.
[02:14:48.924 --> 02:14:51.006]  I turned into Dark Pierre!
[02:14:51.186 --> 02:14:52.326]  And they didn't like it.
[02:14:52.406 --> 02:14:53.527]  And I started calling him Milhouse.
[02:14:53.567 --> 02:14:54.868]  And now he doesn't wear the glasses anymore.
[02:14:54.908 --> 02:14:57.149]  They're very soft people.
[02:14:58.035 --> 02:15:10.464]  You know, at the end of the day, when the truckers, you know, were out there, and all these people, civilians, random moms, dads, business owners were out there in the street, taking these rifle butts to the face by their beloved police forces, where were the politicians that are so self-sacrificed?
[02:15:10.484 --> 02:15:13.506]  We're all pro-Canada, we're about Canada, we're about leadership, we're here for you.
[02:15:13.806 --> 02:15:14.827]  I didn't see you down there.
[02:15:15.147 --> 02:15:15.687]  We were there.
[02:15:16.107 --> 02:15:17.849]  Alex was there, Derek was there, we were all there.
[02:15:17.889 --> 02:15:18.729]  Where were any of you?
[02:15:18.769 --> 02:15:22.472]  You were at home getting millions of dollars and getting a new pool put in, is where you were.
[02:15:22.692 --> 02:15:31.779]   And now they want to hijack the populism and try to When you have the WUF promise boy, the chosen one, saying you're a dangerous terror group, are you worried about them staging false flags and blaming you?
[02:15:31.619 --> 02:15:35.659]   them but I said we got a minute here before you go the they're coming after
[02:15:35.659 --> 02:15:38.418]   us is what they're gonna do it that's always been the plan they're gonna go
[02:15:38.418 --> 02:15:44.259]   after the thought leaders and anybody that's making when you have the WF
[02:15:44.259 --> 02:15:50.619]   promise boy the chosen one saying you're a dangerous terror group are you worried
[02:15:50.619 --> 02:15:53.219]   about them station false flags and blaming you because I mean that they
[02:15:53.219 --> 02:15:57.498]   don't do that for no reason like I think it's an extreme measure that this isn't
[02:15:57.498 --> 02:16:00.498]   often is used as people think it is, but it's always on the table for sure.
[02:16:00.271 --> 02:16:04.335]  I mean, we know there's historical examples of this when the times get desperate and scary.
[02:16:04.375 --> 02:16:08.378]  And, you know, I'm concerned about it at a greater extent to America for what's happening in Israel right now.
[02:16:08.418 --> 02:16:12.321]  I don't know how far they'll go in order to try and elicit support from the American people.
[02:16:12.522 --> 02:16:15.744]  Will they, you know, bomb and blow up another ship like the USS Liberty?
[02:16:15.784 --> 02:16:18.507]  Will they attack another, you know, convention center?
[02:16:18.527 --> 02:16:20.448]  Will they blow up a stadium and say, oh, it was Hamas?
[02:16:20.728 --> 02:16:22.290]  Oh, I'm thinking the new 9-11.
[02:16:22.450 --> 02:16:23.130]  I'm thinking the new 9-11.
[02:16:25.165 --> 02:16:26.586]  50,000 people coming across the border every month.
[02:16:26.906 --> 02:16:27.367]  Who are they?
[02:16:27.687 --> 02:16:28.447]  There's no way to know.
[02:16:28.507 --> 02:16:30.329]  It could be real, it could be a fake.
[02:16:30.969 --> 02:16:31.850]  It's perfect.

[02:17:54.595 --> 02:17:59.020]  The Prime Minister says, we've played the clips, literally we are in danger right now.
[02:17:59.040 --> 02:18:02.484]  I mean, he's wearing like a Cobra Commander mask or something.
[02:18:02.504 --> 02:18:03.065]  I'm so scared.
[02:18:03.405 --> 02:18:05.567]  But listen, Jeremy McKenzie, I've interviewed him before.
[02:18:05.607 --> 02:18:06.108]  Great guy.
[02:18:06.128 --> 02:18:07.389]  He predicts everything that happens in Canada.
[02:18:08.270 --> 02:18:09.912]  I'm good at asking questions and good at interrupting.
[02:18:09.932 --> 02:18:14.475]  We had a good first 20 minutes, but I'm gonna try to give you the floor for about 10 minutes or so, because you're a smart guy.
[02:18:14.975 --> 02:18:16.056]  What do you want to impart to people?
[02:18:16.096 --> 02:18:17.137]  What's happening in Canada?
[02:18:17.177 --> 02:18:17.978]  Why it's important?
[02:18:18.478 --> 02:18:20.440]  You're mentioning America, Trump.
[02:18:20.660 --> 02:18:21.260]  You're a smart guy.
[02:18:21.280 --> 02:18:22.101]  What do you think about that?
[02:18:23.242 --> 02:18:30.007]  As a special ops guy that's been all around the world, how would you quantify the period of time we're in right now and what should the people do?
[02:18:32.844 --> 02:18:34.545]  I was just, you know, kind of thinking about this last night.
[02:18:34.565 --> 02:18:38.908]  I think we're going into one of the most tumultuous and crazy periods of human history, I think.
[02:18:38.928 --> 02:18:40.589]  There's a lot of reasons to think that.
[02:18:40.609 --> 02:18:45.492]  You've got World War III appears to be locked in and no one's interested in turning the tap off of that.
[02:18:45.532 --> 02:18:48.974]  You've got the, you know, potentially an AI apocalypse that could be happening at any time.
[02:18:48.994 --> 02:18:51.976]  The financial situation is globally, you know, in the toilet.
[02:18:52.496 --> 02:19:02.499]  Uh, but the biggest problem I think that's facing certainly Canada, definitely, you know, America, and almost every Western country, and it's certainly not an accident, is the mass migration weapon that's been deployed against the people of those countries.
[02:19:02.559 --> 02:19:06.981]  It's intentionally designed to overwhelm and destroy the countries from within.
[02:19:07.041 --> 02:19:10.902]  We can't support these levels of people, the infrastructure, the doctors, the jobs, the housing, the food.
[02:19:11.162 --> 02:19:13.523]  There's just, there's limited resources, and we didn't have enough as it is.
[02:19:13.543 --> 02:19:18.384]  We've got, you know, homeless people and poor people, so why, why are we bringing in millions of people from across the world?
[02:19:18.464 --> 02:19:19.865]  And where, and which parts of the world?
[02:19:19.925 --> 02:19:27.330]   From the parts of the world where they have The lowest, you know, achievement, the lowest IQs, the lowest standard of livings, the, you know, highest violent, you know, crime rates and all.
[02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:30.132]  These are the people we need the most of, really.
[02:19:30.152 --> 02:19:31.573]  They want Cerf.
[02:19:31.633 --> 02:19:32.133]  On his face.
[02:19:32.153 --> 02:19:33.995]  Said it one in a row, but they want Cerf.
[02:19:35.202 --> 02:19:38.805]  Yeah, well they're going to destroy what we have here, what Western civilization is.
[02:19:38.845 --> 02:19:42.328]  It's going to be erased and it's going to be replaced by a consumer class of slaves.
[02:19:42.448 --> 02:19:48.073]  That's why there's not going to be any national identities, there's not going to be any culture, there's not going to be these people clamoring about their diversity.
[02:19:48.093 --> 02:19:49.514]  It's going to be the end of diversity.
[02:19:49.534 --> 02:19:54.078]  It's just going to be a bunch of blob people that have no attachments or affixions to anything.
[02:19:56.099 --> 02:20:01.518]   Consumers at this point and and and what they're doing is trying to make it illegal and pass legislation
[02:20:01.518 --> 02:20:07.918]   Marketing it as a terrorism or hate apparently we're legislating emotions now, you know hates a very useful emotion
[02:20:07.918 --> 02:20:12.657]   Motivates you to fight back which is what you know got most of us in this into this position in the first place
[02:20:12.657 --> 02:20:16.778]   So they're gonna make that illegal and come after these people like like myself and like yourself and like others
[02:20:16.778 --> 02:20:20.988]   has already been other people Put in jail and targeted just because of their beliefs and
[02:20:20.988 --> 02:20:25.398]   because they think maybe we should you know Circle around each other and ourselves and rebuild the
[02:20:25.398 --> 02:20:29.648]   community and rebuild, you know The the kinship and the camaraderie of the men especially
[02:20:29.648 --> 02:20:34.338]   who have been demoralized more than anyone in in this world in these countries and start sticking up
[02:20:34.338 --> 02:20:38.013]   for each other and looking out for each other and And these groups have been, you know, forming up all over the place.
[02:20:38.033 --> 02:20:39.074]  And they've been jailing these people.
[02:20:39.114 --> 02:20:39.715]  Jailing the leaders.
[02:20:39.735 --> 02:20:42.257]  You've got guys like, uh, Thomas Russo's been put in jail.
[02:20:42.317 --> 02:20:43.358]  Rob Rundo's been put in jail.
[02:20:43.398 --> 02:20:44.119]  I've been put in jail.
[02:20:44.139 --> 02:20:45.180]  Everybody's been put in jail.
[02:20:45.700 --> 02:20:47.582]  Uh, debanked, deplatformed, attacked, slandered.
[02:20:47.622 --> 02:20:51.666]  And, you know, people are firebombing their homes at night on Christmas Eve and stuff like this is going on.
[02:20:52.247 --> 02:20:53.588]  Um, that's not, that's not a problem.
[02:20:53.768 --> 02:20:57.564]   In the meantime, And keep an eye on this in America as well, guys.
[02:20:57.584 --> 02:20:58.545]  I don't know what's going on down there.
[02:20:58.565 --> 02:20:59.566]  I can't keep track of everything.
[02:20:59.606 --> 02:21:04.110]  But in Canada, and apparently it's a global movement, the Revolutionary Communist Party has arrived.
[02:21:04.450 --> 02:21:09.174]  They've had their founding in Congress this month and they're already active across the country calling for armed violent revolution.
[02:21:09.194 --> 02:21:10.215]  And who are they clamoring to?
[02:21:10.575 --> 02:21:11.096]  The migrants.
[02:21:11.156 --> 02:21:13.878]  The migrant hordes of people that demand stuff and things.
[02:21:14.159 --> 02:21:17.141]  Well, here comes the Communist Party with lots of money and organization.
[02:21:17.161 --> 02:21:19.623]  They've been building up and forming up for the last four years.
[02:21:19.643 --> 02:21:22.288]   You can go to marxist.ca Absolutely.
[02:21:22.328 --> 02:21:24.371]  Marxist.ca and you can see it all there.
[02:21:24.391 --> 02:21:25.713]  They're going to university campuses.
[02:21:25.733 --> 02:21:30.861]  The RCMP in this country have said, and I'm on the FBI's watch list apparently by the way, so I may not even be allowed in America.
[02:21:31.920 --> 02:21:45.633]  In Canada, the RCMP, our version of the FBI, our federal police, has said the number one threat and risk in the future is that when regular Canadians find out that they're never going to own a home, they're never going to have a good standard of living... By the way, that report, start over, start over.
[02:21:45.673 --> 02:21:46.654]  That came out a month ago.
[02:21:46.674 --> 02:21:53.201]  The media confirmed it was real, explained the government admits the collapse is coming, that's the main threat, which they've helped engineer.
[02:21:53.241 --> 02:21:53.701]  Explain that.
[02:21:53.741 --> 02:21:55.423]  We don't want to just blaze over that.
[02:21:55.783 --> 02:21:55.983]  Sure.
[02:21:56.404 --> 02:22:05.174]  Yeah, well that came from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and that was their top threat assessment and concern for the immediate future is that when that happens, when all these people especially, and where are the communists recruiting?
[02:22:05.194 --> 02:22:09.479]  They're not going to old age, you know, old homes, old senior centers or anything like that.
[02:22:09.499 --> 02:22:10.340]  They're in universities.
[02:22:10.880 --> 02:22:12.902]  And they're handing out to these, you know, it would have worked on me.
[02:22:12.942 --> 02:22:14.804]  I mean, well, I didn't know what the hell was going on in this world.
[02:22:14.864 --> 02:22:16.445]  I was at least 25 or 26 years old.
[02:22:16.505 --> 02:22:20.989]  I'd already been deployed a couple of times at that stage, and I had some issues and problems with it.
[02:22:21.009 --> 02:22:23.872]  But you've got the soft heads of 20-something kids, idealistic.
[02:22:23.892 --> 02:22:24.973]  They want to do good in the world.
[02:22:24.993 --> 02:22:25.974]  They want to save people.
[02:22:25.994 --> 02:22:26.474]  They want to help.
[02:22:26.534 --> 02:22:29.277]  And here comes the nice red banner of all the solutions.
[02:22:29.297 --> 02:22:35.382]  Here, oh, just do this and just come with us and, you know, to each according to his need and from each according to his ability, right?
[02:22:35.422 --> 02:22:36.123]  And all of this crap.
[02:22:36.503 --> 02:22:43.385]  So, you're going to have a generation of people that can't find anywhere to live, can't get a good job, can't afford it, can't go on vacation, can't provide any kind of life.
[02:22:43.405 --> 02:22:45.646]  How are you going to have and raise a family if you can't even feed yourself?
[02:22:45.686 --> 02:22:46.086]  You can't!
[02:22:46.426 --> 02:22:48.347]  So, you're a slave, essentially, right?
[02:22:48.387 --> 02:22:50.428]  So, this communist marketing is going to take off.
[02:22:50.468 --> 02:22:51.648]  It's going to do really well in Canada.
[02:22:51.668 --> 02:22:53.289]  We're going to have a lot of problems with them.
[02:22:53.529 --> 02:22:54.269]  They are violent.
[02:22:54.329 --> 02:22:55.049]  They are terrorists.
[02:22:55.069 --> 02:22:55.949]  They will kill people.
[02:22:55.989 --> 02:22:56.870]  They will burn farms.
[02:22:57.110 --> 02:23:03.152]   They have been It's arson season again and elections are coming up so stand by for lots of wildfires across the country.
[02:23:03.172 --> 02:23:06.354]  Which is now confirmed to be the communists and they're attacking Tesla facilities.
[02:23:06.374 --> 02:23:07.615]  They're just attacking everything.
[02:23:07.635 --> 02:23:07.835]  Correct.
[02:23:08.427 --> 02:23:15.952]  Yep, and on top of this, they've been having cover and PR run for them by the Canadian Anti-Hate Network, who is, once again, the CEO is Bernie Farber.
[02:23:16.033 --> 02:23:28.662]  Bernie Farber is also the CEO of the Canadian Jewish Congress, which has since been absorbed by the Centre for International Jewish Affairs in Canada, which has been leading the charge in making sure everyone gets this bill passed.
[02:23:28.682 --> 02:23:36.174]   They're saying, contact your MPs, everybody in Canada, and stand up for the Jews by pushing this legislation that makes it, will put people in
[02:23:36.174 --> 02:23:39.744]   prison for life for saying things that we don't like inside their own country, says us,
[02:23:39.744 --> 02:23:44.663]   foreigners. It's disgusting and it's insane. It's criminal and the government's giving them money.
[02:23:44.663 --> 02:23:46.404]  They just gave them another half a million dollars.
[02:23:46.404 --> 02:23:48.904]   They've already given them substantial amounts of money in the past.
[02:23:48.904 --> 02:23:53.384]   So this group has been, you know, laying the groundwork in the narrative to push out there and basically...
[02:23:53.384 --> 02:23:55.384]  Let me ask you this and then continue.
[02:23:55.384 --> 02:24:00.744]   Before I forget though, because you know, I'm not anti-Israel, any of that, but I'm also against some of the things our
[02:24:00.744 --> 02:24:01.304]  government does.
[02:24:02.011 --> 02:24:05.513]  Why is Israel trying to ship a million Palestinians here, but saying they can't take them?
[02:24:05.893 --> 02:24:09.496]  And why are the Jewish Congresses trying to bring the Muslims here, their enemy?
[02:24:09.516 --> 02:24:11.017]  Well, it's simple, destabilization.
[02:24:11.077 --> 02:24:13.819]  So, Israel's legitimate criticism target here.
[02:24:15.186 --> 02:24:15.626]  Absolutely.
[02:24:15.826 --> 02:24:17.407]  I mean, they're committing genocide in the open.
[02:24:17.427 --> 02:24:18.287]  That's undisputable.
[02:24:18.347 --> 02:24:19.167]  It's wide open.
[02:24:19.207 --> 02:24:20.067]  You can see it happening.
[02:24:20.448 --> 02:24:22.668]  And that's irregardless of what you think about Hamas or whatever.
[02:24:23.008 --> 02:24:28.890]  My problem is as, you know, I care about our honor as a people and who we stand with and who we support and what we don't.
[02:24:28.930 --> 02:24:29.910]  That reflects upon us.
[02:24:29.930 --> 02:24:36.952]  And if we're going to give these people money and give them our even just platitudes and say, you know, we're on your side as they're doing these kinds of things.
[02:24:36.992 --> 02:24:38.453]  What does that look like in the eyes of the world?
[02:24:38.513 --> 02:24:44.635]   What will our children judge us for in the future if we stand shoulder to shoulder with people that are Yeah, well what does Israel think?
[02:24:44.655 --> 02:24:49.138]  Because Israel has gone from being overall, you know, not hated, kind of 50-50, to like 90% of the world's against them.
[02:24:48.957 --> 02:24:50.957]  I mean the Internet, it's got it all.
[02:24:50.957 --> 02:24:51.957]  So, yeah.
[02:24:51.957 --> 02:24:53.957]  Yeah, well what does Israel think?
[02:24:53.957 --> 02:24:59.957]   Because they are, Israel has gone from being overall, you know, not hated, kind of 50/50
[02:24:59.957 --> 02:25:01.957]  to like 90% of the world's against them.
[02:25:01.957 --> 02:25:03.957]  What is Netanyahu doing?
[02:25:03.957 --> 02:25:04.957]  I don't know.
[02:25:05.068 --> 02:25:06.729]  I couldn't get in the mind of that guy if I tried.
[02:25:06.769 --> 02:25:07.709]  He's a criminal.
[02:25:07.749 --> 02:25:09.691]  He's been involved in all sorts of nefarious things.
[02:25:09.751 --> 02:25:13.573]  Actually, my introduction to him was from you, actually, many years ago, Alex.
[02:25:13.994 --> 02:25:18.977]  After 9-11, he came to give a speech to Congress and he had something like 70 standing ovations in a row.
[02:25:19.017 --> 02:25:19.477]  No U.S.
[02:25:19.517 --> 02:25:21.519]  President ever gets his butt kissed that much.
[02:25:21.979 --> 02:25:24.100]  That was an interesting thing that happened.
[02:25:24.821 --> 02:25:27.543]  Their line of talking is, well, the Palestinians are terrorists.
[02:25:27.563 --> 02:25:28.063]  They're scum.
[02:25:28.083 --> 02:25:28.664]  They're monsters.
[02:25:28.684 --> 02:25:29.684]  We've got to get rid of them.
[02:25:29.984 --> 02:25:30.765]  So you take them.
[02:25:31.494 --> 02:25:41.723]  So, you, our greatest ally, our greatest friend, your gift to us is you're going to massacre all these people, and then their living survivors, if there's any left, you're going to send them to live with us, the people that helped facilitate their destruction.
[02:25:42.104 --> 02:25:43.605]  Oh, thank you very much, greatest friend.
[02:25:43.685 --> 02:25:44.746]  That's so beautiful.
[02:25:44.966 --> 02:25:48.349]  By the way, how many Israeli battalions fought with us in Iraq and Afghanistan?
[02:25:48.489 --> 02:25:49.590]  I can't recall a single one.
[02:25:49.991 --> 02:25:53.594]  Can't recall a single air sortie mission flown, spec ops mission, no, nothing.
[02:25:54.114 --> 02:25:55.617]  But we are to fight their wars for them.
[02:25:55.677 --> 02:25:56.858]  Our troops are deployed there right now.
[02:25:57.239 --> 02:25:58.080]  That's a good point.
[02:25:58.280 --> 02:26:00.203]  Israel never deploys to these other wars.
[02:26:00.223 --> 02:26:03.467]  I think their argument would be that would galvanize the population against us.
[02:26:05.251 --> 02:26:05.391]  Sure.
[02:26:05.711 --> 02:26:12.715]  I think that's been working just fine as it is because you see all these leftist protests and these, you know, it's in vogue, right?
[02:26:12.735 --> 02:26:16.077]  So a lot of these pro-Palestinian protesters, it's just the new BLM part too.
[02:26:16.117 --> 02:26:17.237]  Oh, they're bad too!
[02:26:17.257 --> 02:26:21.700]  That's what I'm saying is, what do you do when it's clearly a contrived clash of civilizations?
[02:26:21.720 --> 02:26:26.182]  On one hand, Biden gives Israel the bombs, but on the other hand, gives lip service, oh I love you Palestinians.
[02:26:27.113 --> 02:26:28.654]  Yeah, I think it's clear.
[02:26:28.674 --> 02:26:29.635]  I mean, they're bad.
[02:26:29.655 --> 02:26:30.576]  They're doing terrible things.
[02:26:30.736 --> 02:26:31.577]  We should just cut ties.
[02:26:31.597 --> 02:26:35.400]  I mean, we wouldn't have... If the Russians were doing this, what would we do?
[02:26:35.540 --> 02:26:46.929]  If it was the Portuguese, if it was the Chinese, if it was anyone else, it would be, you know... But for some reason, we don't need to draw too many conclusions as to why that is, the Israelis could get away with whatever they want, literally including murder.
[02:26:46.949 --> 02:26:48.290]  In fact, they killed one of our soldiers.
[02:26:48.650 --> 02:26:54.095]  They killed a major from the Princess Patricia's because he reported war crimes he was observing, and they said it was an accident.
[02:26:54.115 --> 02:26:56.156]  Well, they dropped a 500-pound bomb directly on his head.
[02:26:57.117 --> 02:26:59.018]  Laser-guided bombs are accurate to within two meters.
[02:26:59.079 --> 02:27:00.419]  At least you didn't feel anything.
[02:27:02.141 --> 02:27:04.302]  Followed up by an artillery barrage on top of that.
[02:27:04.342 --> 02:27:06.564]  So it was a multiple, it was a lumber of accidents, right?
[02:27:06.584 --> 02:27:07.444]  That this is just what they do.
[02:27:07.725 --> 02:27:08.605]  Oh, they apologized.
[02:27:08.645 --> 02:27:09.086]  Sure they did.
[02:27:10.367 --> 02:27:11.207]  So let me ask you this.
[02:27:11.267 --> 02:27:13.389]  You go back to Israel, if you want, I'm not cutting you off on that subject.
[02:27:13.669 --> 02:27:15.971]  You're a military guy, smart guy, watch your show a lot.
[02:27:16.531 --> 02:27:19.353]  What about Russia overrunning the defenses?
[02:27:19.653 --> 02:27:20.514]  Ukraine's lost.
[02:27:20.874 --> 02:27:22.355]  Now Germany's gonna send troops.
[02:27:22.615 --> 02:27:24.096]  They've got conscription being set up.
[02:27:24.136 --> 02:27:24.937]  This is crazy.
[02:27:25.994 --> 02:27:26.654]  It is crazy.
[02:27:26.795 --> 02:27:32.457]  Not only is the war insane to engage in and do anyway, just on the basis of facts, like why are we fighting the war?
[02:27:32.677 --> 02:27:36.900]  These are not sufficient reasons to sacrifice what will be hundreds of millions of people if not war.
[02:27:37.140 --> 02:27:38.020]  Europe will be destroyed.
[02:27:40.488 --> 02:27:42.130]  More to that, let's pretend they are good reasons.
[02:27:42.170 --> 02:27:44.552]  Let's pretend, well, we have a good reason to fight this war.
[02:27:44.612 --> 02:27:44.912]  We don't.
[02:27:44.932 --> 02:27:45.853]  But let's pretend that we do.
[02:27:46.214 --> 02:27:48.095]  We can't win that confrontation.
[02:27:48.255 --> 02:27:48.756]  Not even close.
[02:27:48.976 --> 02:27:50.958]  Canada has maybe 2,000 combat soldiers.
[02:27:51.138 --> 02:27:51.438]  Maybe.
[02:27:51.839 --> 02:27:52.159]  Maybe.
[02:27:52.459 --> 02:27:53.901]  What is their job going to be?
[02:27:53.961 --> 02:27:58.685]  Well, they're going to be to hold up the Russians for about four hours in Latvia before they're all liquidated and moved out of the way.
[02:27:58.725 --> 02:28:02.388]  The Russians have over 2 million combat soldiers on the line ready to go right now.
[02:28:02.709 --> 02:28:03.570]  They've been battle-tested.
[02:28:03.590 --> 02:28:04.931]  They've seen everything we've got in Ukraine.
[02:28:05.578 --> 02:28:06.278]  They're ready to go.
[02:28:06.539 --> 02:28:09.100]  We're worried about tampons and bathrooms.
[02:28:09.140 --> 02:28:10.821]  We have massive attrition rate problems.
[02:28:11.481 --> 02:28:13.302]  Our fighting units are at 15% strength.
[02:28:13.362 --> 02:28:14.183]  It's a catastrophe.
[02:28:14.403 --> 02:28:16.204]  Canada doesn't have a military anymore.
[02:28:17.565 --> 02:28:20.806]  And by the way, the Russians have not balked losing a half million.
[02:28:21.107 --> 02:28:21.887]  The numbers are out.
[02:28:22.007 --> 02:28:26.189]  Even the UN admits, the Global Summit, the Russians want more war than Putin wants.
[02:28:26.229 --> 02:28:28.931]  So they're ready to go full war, just like World War II.
[02:28:29.311 --> 02:28:30.852]  Russians don't give up once you get in a fight.
[02:28:31.894 --> 02:28:36.836]  Yeah, and they, you know, accurately, for my opinion, perceived themselves to be being attacked by the whole world.
[02:28:36.876 --> 02:28:38.036]  The whole thing was, don't move.
[02:28:38.316 --> 02:28:43.618]  Listen, we had the NATO agreement, don't move the, you know, the borders of NATO any further, any further east.
[02:28:43.638 --> 02:28:45.299]  There'll be no eastward expansion of NATO.
[02:28:45.339 --> 02:28:46.179]  That was the whole deal.
[02:28:46.239 --> 02:28:47.119]  And what has it been doing?
[02:28:47.159 --> 02:28:48.240]  Going east ever since.
[02:28:48.380 --> 02:28:49.480]  One after the other, after the other.
[02:28:49.500 --> 02:28:51.021]  And every time, the Russians are like, stop this.
[02:28:51.041 --> 02:28:54.342]  We can't live under, we can't live with a gun to our heads like this.
[02:28:54.762 --> 02:29:03.505]  And now they want, you know, well we don't want Ukraine in now, and we want to put ballistic missile systems right on the border of Russia, so where we'll have first strike, you know, monopolies, and we can just wipe them out whenever they want.
[02:29:03.525 --> 02:29:04.805]  We would never put up with that.
[02:29:06.245 --> 02:29:06.846]  Absolutely not.
[02:29:06.886 --> 02:29:08.646]  This is the same as the Cuban Missile Crisis today.
[02:29:08.686 --> 02:29:14.588]  Like, we didn't put up with, President Kennedy didn't put up with the Russians putting missiles in Cuba, pointing them, you know, directly at Capitol America.
[02:29:14.648 --> 02:29:18.389]  And that was because we put Nike missiles with nukes in Turkey.
[02:29:19.793 --> 02:29:19.993]  Right.
[02:29:20.613 --> 02:29:21.653]  Yeah, right.
[02:29:21.693 --> 02:29:22.454]  So it was a counter move.
[02:29:22.474 --> 02:29:24.274]  So why should they put up with it?
[02:29:24.474 --> 02:29:26.694]  And why can't we have these conversations as human beings?
[02:29:26.734 --> 02:29:27.274]  Isn't that better?
[02:29:27.294 --> 02:29:35.376]  To get to the truth of what's going on and avoid the senseless deaths of tens of millions, hundreds of millions of people, none of whom will be politicians or their families, by the way.
[02:29:35.696 --> 02:29:36.476]  Absolutely none of them.
[02:29:36.496 --> 02:29:37.116]  Explain that.
[02:29:37.396 --> 02:29:44.038]  All the threat equations by Iran Corporation, everybody said that we're going into a probability of nuclear war on the threat escalation ladder.
[02:29:44.618 --> 02:29:45.818]  Most people aren't a soldier like you.
[02:29:45.878 --> 02:29:46.478]  Explain that to them.
[02:29:48.044 --> 02:30:00.608]  Well, so, the first strike capability, or I think policy of every country now is if you're, basically as the algorithm plays out and it looks like you're on the path to, you know, war is inevitable, it's preferable to hit first.
[02:30:00.848 --> 02:30:02.949]  That's your best chance to survive that exchange.
[02:30:03.429 --> 02:30:04.970]  And we're all teetering on the edge of that.
[02:30:05.010 --> 02:30:08.191]  Now, whether they're crazy enough to go through with that, I don't know.
[02:30:08.211 --> 02:30:11.532]  I would expect there's probably going to be some limited form of nuclear exchanges.
[02:30:11.552 --> 02:30:16.674]  I wouldn't be surprised to see these as it gets escalated and maybe people hit the panic button on how crazy this is getting.
[02:30:17.415 --> 02:30:36.471]  I mean, you've got, the Ukrainian theater has taken everything that NATO has, all of our reserves are gone, all of our financial weapons we could use were broke, we have no money, all of our reserves of stockpiled ammunition, body armor, all of it's gone, all of our extra ammunition, we've sent our artillery cannons, Canada has, to Ukraine, those have been destroyed, who are you going to fight with and with what against these people?
[02:30:36.531 --> 02:30:41.135]  And Russia's been in a war economy for over a year now, they've got their people in factories making tanks and planes.
[02:30:41.195 --> 02:30:43.337]  And they've got submarines encircling us.
[02:30:45.352 --> 02:30:46.094]  Yep.
[02:30:46.294 --> 02:30:48.538]  We are not in any position to fight right now.
[02:30:48.618 --> 02:30:53.906]  If you wanted to fight, and let's pretend I agree that we should fight, this is not a fight we can win, not even close.
[02:30:54.007 --> 02:30:57.052]  Yeah, at least Hitler, before he attacked everybody, built up a giant army.
[02:30:58.690 --> 02:30:59.950]  At least try to win, right?
[02:30:59.970 --> 02:31:01.831]  Give yourself a chance.
[02:31:02.291 --> 02:31:03.991]  And it's just, again, why are we doing this?
[02:31:04.711 --> 02:31:05.331]  Ask the politicians.
[02:31:05.351 --> 02:31:06.772]  They're the ones that need this to happen.
[02:31:06.792 --> 02:31:08.472]  They're up there every day, banging the drum.
[02:31:08.532 --> 02:31:09.872]  Oh, Russia this and Putin that.
[02:31:09.912 --> 02:31:10.872]  We gotta, we gotta, we gotta.
[02:31:11.072 --> 02:31:12.253]  When are you gonna go, then?
[02:31:12.333 --> 02:31:15.853]  If you wanna fight, you go first, and then I'll see if I feel like coming with you.
[02:31:15.893 --> 02:31:16.433]  It's your fight.
[02:31:16.473 --> 02:31:17.314]  You're the one that wants it.
[02:31:17.534 --> 02:31:18.294]  I think you should go.
[02:31:18.534 --> 02:31:20.034]  I think you should go, Ben Shapiro.
[02:31:20.074 --> 02:31:27.364]   I think you should draft Ben Shapiro, put him in the United States Marines, and drop him right there on the front line if he wants wants to go so badly. Before you take another American kid,
[02:31:27.364 --> 02:31:32.914]   I'm a child of this war, I grew up through this, I was 16, 15 years old during 9/11, I hit
[02:31:32.914 --> 02:31:37.064]   the army when I was 16, 17, and I was in there for 15 years and I've watched countless
[02:31:37.064 --> 02:31:41.073]   amounts of boxes of people come home for no reason, no explanation, why are we there?
[02:31:41.073 --> 02:31:42.634]  Nobody knows.
[02:31:42.658 --> 02:31:44.160]  The suicides over and over and over.
[02:31:44.220 --> 02:31:44.941]  The endless death.
[02:31:44.961 --> 02:31:45.622]  The endless ruin.
[02:31:45.642 --> 02:31:46.383]  The endless destruction.
[02:31:46.403 --> 02:31:51.369]  And then the humiliation of the disastrous pullout of Afghanistan on top of it at the end of the day.
[02:31:51.649 --> 02:31:52.851]  Was there even an apology?
[02:31:53.071 --> 02:31:54.353]  An entire generation of veterans.
[02:31:54.373 --> 02:31:56.556]  You've got a million combat veterans in America, by the way.
[02:31:57.317 --> 02:31:58.178]  Watch this happen.
[02:31:58.518 --> 02:31:59.199]  Watch that happen.
[02:32:00.487 --> 02:32:01.567]  And we're just going to do another one?
[02:32:02.148 --> 02:32:02.888]  Ah, forget all that.
[02:32:02.928 --> 02:32:03.548]  Let's just do another.
[02:32:03.568 --> 02:32:07.770]  We'll just find a new crop of young American white boys to fly, throw into the meat grinder.
[02:32:07.790 --> 02:32:09.571]  We can't beat the cavemen in Afghanistan.
[02:32:09.591 --> 02:32:11.751]  Let's start a war with Russia, the biggest nuclear power.
[02:32:12.112 --> 02:32:18.034]  Since we failed here after 20 years, let's go, since we failed fighting a 100-pound guy, let's go fight an 800-pound gorilla.
[02:32:19.198 --> 02:32:19.618]  Yeah.
[02:32:19.718 --> 02:32:21.499]  And we're the decadent... I mean, they're not wrong, right?
[02:32:21.539 --> 02:32:23.941]  I mean, I don't... I mean, I'll... Fair criticism is fair criticism.
[02:32:23.961 --> 02:32:24.841]  We're the decadent West.
[02:32:24.881 --> 02:32:28.404]  We've become lazy and soft and fat and entitled and full of ourselves.
[02:32:28.984 --> 02:32:38.890]  And, you know, it speaks to this old kind of joke I heard back in the day where it was... I don't know if it's true, but NASA spent, you know, $20 million developing a pen that will work in space, and the Russians brought a pencil.
[02:32:39.562 --> 02:32:44.510]  So, they've been forced to think and adapt and work with fair limits.
[02:32:44.570 --> 02:32:45.692]  I mean, Russia's not a massive country.
[02:32:45.712 --> 02:32:47.054]  There's a hundred million or so people, right?
[02:32:47.074 --> 02:32:49.658]  But their GDP is not, they're not as massive.
[02:32:49.698 --> 02:32:50.679]  It's not the Soviet Union.
[02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:52.762]  California has a bigger GDP.
[02:32:54.358 --> 02:33:01.885]  So they're working with what they've had to learn how to be efficient and lean with everything and make it work and fight hard and suffer and the sanctions and all of this.
[02:33:02.245 --> 02:33:04.067]  And again, this is who you're going up against.
[02:33:04.087 --> 02:33:04.948]  This is who you'll be fighting against.
[02:33:04.988 --> 02:33:09.472]  And like you said, they've actually lost a lot of people fighting this war in Ukraine and they're not slowing down.
[02:33:10.292 --> 02:33:15.795]  Their appetite for justice and, you know, perceived, you know, their justice and self-defense has not withered at all.
[02:33:16.175 --> 02:33:20.077]  And ours is, I mean, we've got a massive security problem with all these migrants in the country.
[02:33:20.157 --> 02:33:21.638]  Our police forces are barely hanging on.
[02:33:21.898 --> 02:33:23.638]  Our medical systems are in disrepair.
[02:33:23.939 --> 02:33:25.279]  Never mind, you know, the vaccine situation.
[02:33:25.299 --> 02:33:30.582]  Soros on the left is defunding police, creating mass crime, cutting off our pipelines.
[02:33:30.602 --> 02:33:31.242]  You're in a war.
[02:33:31.282 --> 02:33:32.182]  You want more energy.
[02:33:32.443 --> 02:33:36.084]  Instead, the globals are attacking us and the Russians because they're technocrats.
[02:33:36.104 --> 02:33:37.385]  They're attacking all of humanity.
[02:33:39.068 --> 02:33:46.091]  Well, I think, and I'm concerned as well, the fertility is down 86-87% in a lot of countries I'm seeing and, you know, they don't know why.
[02:33:46.151 --> 02:33:47.072]  Experts are baffled.
[02:33:47.132 --> 02:33:48.732]  It may have had something to do with medicine time.
[02:33:49.053 --> 02:33:50.333]  Ever see the movie Children of Men?
[02:33:50.633 --> 02:33:50.793]  Yep.
[02:33:51.034 --> 02:33:54.735]  I had a chill when I watched that movie and I thought, oh, if you're ever going to get rid of people, that's the thought.
[02:33:54.755 --> 02:33:55.816]  I just watched that again last week.
[02:33:55.856 --> 02:33:56.836]  I'm doing a review this week.
[02:33:57.296 --> 02:33:58.317]  God, that movie's pressing.
[02:33:59.662 --> 02:34:04.484]  That's the soft genocide that we saw, you know, probably in high school when I saw that and I came out and I was like, that's scary.
[02:34:04.524 --> 02:34:06.465]  But that was applied to who first?
[02:34:06.505 --> 02:34:07.966]  Who was the first people that had to get it?
[02:34:07.986 --> 02:34:09.166]  Well, the military did, didn't they?
[02:34:09.287 --> 02:34:09.827]  And the police.
[02:34:10.660 --> 02:34:12.382]  And China took their own special vaccine.
[02:34:12.642 --> 02:34:13.362]  And so did Russia.
[02:34:13.763 --> 02:34:14.343]  Isn't that nice?
[02:34:14.643 --> 02:34:15.784]  Everyone, does everybody know that?
[02:34:16.145 --> 02:34:17.766]  So we've got all, they don't have these issues.
[02:34:18.046 --> 02:34:19.427]  All they have to do is wait us out.
[02:34:19.788 --> 02:34:20.688]  They don't even have to fight us.
[02:34:20.928 --> 02:34:24.171]  If we force the issue and make it that they have to fight, that they will, I'm sure.
[02:34:24.551 --> 02:34:28.174]  But the smart money, or my money, is they'll just sit and chill and wait us out.
[02:34:28.194 --> 02:34:29.736]  We're destroying and eating ourselves every day.
[02:34:30.216 --> 02:34:30.876]  I think it's just hubris.
[02:34:30.715 --> 02:34:35.474]   missions kill humans depopulate so they control an empire they're trying to use
[02:34:35.474 --> 02:34:38.795]   to kill everybody but if they've got us as captives they can't help but kill
[02:34:38.795 --> 02:34:43.314]   their own people which which weakens them that it's a very satanic algorithm
[02:34:43.314 --> 02:34:48.035]   I think it's just hubris I think they think that they can just do it and you
[02:34:48.035 --> 02:34:51.591]   know they're only people at the end of the day You know, they're not gods.
[02:34:51.631 --> 02:34:54.293]  They're not, you know, these all-powerful, you know, titans.
[02:34:54.313 --> 02:34:56.055]  It's not Prometheus you're up against.
[02:34:56.155 --> 02:34:59.998]  It's just, it's a bunch of fat old, you know, imbeciles who have had too much money.
[02:35:00.339 --> 02:35:15.141]   And I like to say, too, is when you consider where these kind of dynasties began in, you know, the 1700s and 1800s and You know, turn of the 20th century, these guys would be out there like strangling Chinese slave workers on railroad tracks themselves personally to get it done, to get Standard Oil back on business.
[02:35:15.481 --> 02:35:20.385]  Now it's, you know, the rotten, spoiled great-grandchildren of those kinds of people who grew up with a silver spoon.
[02:35:20.625 --> 02:35:22.807]  I mean, Hunter Biden's literally smoking crack.
[02:35:22.927 --> 02:35:24.708]  That is a perfect historical analogy.
[02:35:24.748 --> 02:35:25.049]  It's true.
[02:35:25.069 --> 02:35:25.749]  People don't know.
[02:35:26.230 --> 02:35:28.932]  Carnegie was beating steelworkers to death.
[02:35:29.807 --> 02:35:38.277]  When he was like 60 years old, and the Rockefellers were literally like, that's a famous story, strangling railway workers that didn't do what they were told, and bull whipping people.
[02:35:38.598 --> 02:35:40.320]  So you could say, yeah, they're evil, but they're not.
[02:35:40.340 --> 02:35:43.303]  They're great, great grandkids that are literally mentally ill nobodies.
[02:35:44.793 --> 02:35:46.954]  Yeah, they're soft and I think they're very beatable.
[02:35:47.134 --> 02:35:48.574]  I mean, look at Canada.
[02:35:48.594 --> 02:35:49.995]  We're not up against Joseph Stalin.
[02:35:50.035 --> 02:35:51.495]  I mean, they're a bunch of spoiled children.
[02:35:51.535 --> 02:36:02.799]  This guy's a drama teacher trust fund baby and you've got career politicians and rich people driving their BMWs around talking about how the world is and how it's going to be and you guys are going to have to do what we say as they get richer and richer and everybody gets poorer and poorer.
[02:36:03.039 --> 02:36:03.679]  It's not going to work.
[02:36:03.739 --> 02:36:04.480]  It's not going to last.
[02:36:04.740 --> 02:36:11.362]  They don't have the stones and the parts to deal with the problems that are coming our way, I think, and there's going to be quite the sea change.
[02:36:12.302 --> 02:36:14.883]  In social affairs over the next couple of decades, I'm pretty sure.
[02:36:14.903 --> 02:36:23.206]  And by the way, if you don't know about Joe Stalin, who's a bad guy from Georgia, he gets hired by the Communist low level and does raids on police stations and robs banks.
[02:36:23.786 --> 02:36:24.467]  Hundreds of them.
[02:36:24.507 --> 02:36:29.088]  He cleans out hundreds of police stations and banks in his first five, six years.
[02:36:29.108 --> 02:36:31.269]  He's such a killer amongst killers.
[02:36:31.549 --> 02:36:33.130]  He gets promoted to the highest levels.
[02:36:33.410 --> 02:36:34.670]  They get rid of Lenin and put him in.
[02:36:35.011 --> 02:36:37.491]  Imagine that badass compared to these people.
[02:36:37.511 --> 02:36:39.652]  I mean, it's like Trudeau wants to be a dictator.
[02:36:39.672 --> 02:36:41.293]  Dude, you ain't got what it takes.
[02:36:42.571 --> 02:36:42.831]  Correct.
[02:36:43.212 --> 02:36:46.795]  I think that's right, but my concern is the younger... I mean, you don't know who's out there.
[02:36:46.835 --> 02:36:48.116]  You've got these angry kids, right?
[02:36:48.156 --> 02:36:52.420]  A whole generation of angry 20-somethings and 30-somethings, or maybe younger, that have no future.
[02:36:52.480 --> 02:36:58.145]  Legitimately, they have no future because it's been stolen from them by these freaks, and they're going to be misdirected and put into communism, and you don't know what they're going to do.
[02:36:58.506 --> 02:37:04.411]  They're going to look up to people like Joseph Stalin and Vladimir Lenin and Trotsky and Kaganovich and, you know, Gendryk Yagoda and all these people.
[02:37:04.531 --> 02:37:07.314]  They're going to look up to them like heroes and be like, oh, this is what we have to do.
[02:37:07.654 --> 02:37:09.275]  And they're going to emulate their heroes, aren't they?
[02:37:09.616 --> 02:37:10.897]  So I don't see a way.
[02:37:11.117 --> 02:37:12.398]  We can't coexist with these people.
[02:37:12.438 --> 02:37:13.719]  They don't mean to leave us alone.
[02:37:13.759 --> 02:37:19.484]  They're not interested in any kind of lifestyle or quality of life that we're accustomed to or desires.
[02:37:19.504 --> 02:37:21.887]  And they're going to aim to take that away from us and fight us over it.
[02:37:21.947 --> 02:37:24.169]  And we can either defend ourselves or let them take it.
[02:37:24.249 --> 02:37:26.231]  That's really, unfortunately, the reality.
[02:37:26.251 --> 02:37:28.393]  So in closing, what happens to Fideau?
[02:37:30.498 --> 02:37:31.239]  I think he's finished.
[02:37:31.839 --> 02:37:32.539]  That's desperate.
[02:37:32.579 --> 02:37:44.467]  I mean, it's preposterous to say that as a legitimate form of political contention that, well, my opponents are not any good to lead this country because something something Alex Jones and oh, somebody scribbled a thing on a door.
[02:37:45.180 --> 02:37:46.842]  My guy, half the place is on fire.
[02:37:46.862 --> 02:37:52.909]  You've got communist arsonists have burned down hundreds of churches, fields, you know, forests are happening, the overdoses, the killings.
[02:37:53.129 --> 02:37:56.553]  You've got Indian gang wars happening, Calistani separatists in the tens of thousands.
[02:37:56.773 --> 02:38:03.381]  They're all just out paraded around worshipping this guy who masterminded the Air India bombing, which was the worst Canadian terrorist attack in national history.
[02:38:03.701 --> 02:38:08.909]  All three political candidates were on the stage putting on the hats and the costumes and doing the dances and all that kind of stuff.
[02:38:08.930 --> 02:38:10.131]  So it's a mess up here.
[02:38:10.151 --> 02:38:11.474]  I don't expect it to get any better.
[02:38:11.994 --> 02:38:14.058]  But it's just the desperate flailings of a dying regime.
[02:38:14.078 --> 02:38:17.102]  He's on the way out and I don't think his own people even support him anymore at this point.
[02:38:18.005 --> 02:38:25.108]  It's going to be a landslide for the conservatives, I'm sure, and then it's going to be another dance with a new dance partner, and it'll be more of the same.
[02:38:25.148 --> 02:38:29.550]  I think they're going to really crack down on people and free speech just as much or more than the liberals have.
[02:38:29.590 --> 02:38:32.451]  It'll just come under a different lane, a different frequency.
[02:38:33.972 --> 02:38:39.055]  Anti- it'll be anti-semitism and you know pro-Hamas sentiment has to be crushed and we have to stop these.
[02:38:39.095 --> 02:38:42.596]  They're dangerous and this kind of stuff and then the jail sentences and stuff will come that way.
[02:38:42.636 --> 02:38:47.419]  It'll just come under different verbiage and different kind of lingo, but it's the same spirit, benevolent, same level of spirit.
[02:38:47.439 --> 02:38:52.181]  Are there any groups in Canada, and that goes for everywhere else, that could get the country back and turn this around?
[02:38:53.661 --> 02:38:55.662]  I think the people of the country have to do that themselves.
[02:38:55.722 --> 02:38:57.343]  In Canada, it's like, this is your time.
[02:38:57.383 --> 02:38:58.184]  It's put up or shut up.
[02:38:58.284 --> 02:39:03.627]  It's been almost 200 years now we've been around and every country goes through these, you know, trials and tribulations.
[02:39:03.647 --> 02:39:05.007]  You either survive or you don't.
[02:39:05.308 --> 02:39:08.910]  You know, China, France, like some of these, Russia, they've been around a long time.
[02:39:08.930 --> 02:39:11.151]  They've been around a long time because they've fought and defended themselves.
[02:39:11.270 --> 02:39:15.350]   when the time came. Now Canada might fight and defend itself and win, or it won't.
[02:39:15.350 --> 02:39:19.910]   And it'll go into the dustbin of history of a bunch of other failed countries that tried to be something and never
[02:39:19.910 --> 02:39:23.510]   could, because eventually winter comes and you have to face that.
[02:39:23.510 --> 02:39:27.109]   And if you can't, then you don't deserve to exist. You don't deserve to go on.
[02:39:27.109 --> 02:39:29.109]  Have you seen the movie Civil War?
[02:39:31.607 --> 02:39:34.788]  I did see the trailer, but it's very nicely timed.
[02:39:34.868 --> 02:39:38.769]  It's there to galvanize people for what I think is inevitably coming to the United States.
[02:39:39.169 --> 02:39:40.990]  I think Trump is overwhelmingly going to win.
[02:39:41.030 --> 02:39:43.170]  I mean, why even have an election at this point?
[02:39:43.210 --> 02:39:43.770]  It's that bad.
[02:39:44.751 --> 02:39:45.911]  So what do they do?
[02:39:45.951 --> 02:39:46.471]  Do they kill him?
[02:39:46.591 --> 02:39:47.131]  Maybe they do.
[02:39:47.591 --> 02:39:48.992]  And that's going to ensure a civil war.
[02:39:49.032 --> 02:39:49.752]  So here's the thing.
[02:39:50.072 --> 02:39:51.092]  Is it the Russians that did it?
[02:39:51.172 --> 02:39:52.152]  Is it the Chinese that did it?
[02:39:52.232 --> 02:39:53.213]  Is it Hamas that did it?
[02:39:53.273 --> 02:39:53.913]  Is it Israel?
[02:39:54.033 --> 02:39:55.213]  It could have been anyone.
[02:39:55.453 --> 02:39:57.254]  Just like JFK, you've got so many enemies.
[02:39:58.134 --> 02:39:58.677]  No, I agree.
[02:39:58.737 --> 02:39:59.942]  I think they're gonna try to kill Trump.
[02:39:59.962 --> 02:40:02.353]  I think they're gonna try to kill Trump, but I think he's got nine lives.
[02:40:04.170 --> 02:40:07.513]  I hope that doesn't happen, but that would be the fastest way to ensure the destruction of America.
[02:40:07.533 --> 02:40:17.719]  America would tear itself apart in a civil war, I'm sure, and both sides have already conceded, the Republicans and the Democrats, they're not going to, whatever the election results, if it's not what they want, they're not going to accept it.
[02:40:17.760 --> 02:40:33.670]   That's why you should watch Civil War, because it's a $300-plus million production, and these idiots watch it and say it's not political, it's white people being killed by multiracial groups, the American flag is evil and does suicide bombings, and America falls and they kill a Trump figure, Yeah.
[02:40:33.931 --> 02:40:35.373]  I mean, this is... Oh, really?
[02:40:35.734 --> 02:40:39.299]  Oh, it's programming to remove Trump, which they've said they're going to do.
[02:40:39.319 --> 02:40:44.888]  The Democrats have already said, Senator Blumenthal said, we're going to remove him during a civil emergency.
[02:40:44.908 --> 02:40:47.852]  So the minute he gets reelected, that's when the uprisings start.
[02:40:47.893 --> 02:40:48.634]  People better get ready.
[02:40:49.801 --> 02:40:50.162]  I think so.
[02:40:50.222 --> 02:40:52.344]  And again, 50,000 people, mostly men.
[02:40:52.625 --> 02:40:54.227]  Mostly fighting-age men from all over.
[02:40:54.247 --> 02:40:55.648]  Pakistan, India, China.
[02:40:55.849 --> 02:40:56.810]  How are you getting here?
[02:40:57.070 --> 02:41:04.339]  There's a trail of camps run by, you know, non-governmental organizations, many or even all of them run by Israelis and Jews, pulling these people into America.
[02:41:04.399 --> 02:41:07.363]  And they're being framed as the... There's an us and them that's happening.
[02:41:07.663 --> 02:41:11.145]  There's the American patriots, and then there's everybody else that are oppressed.
[02:41:11.466 --> 02:41:15.948]  There are the masses of the world that have been subjugated by white supremacy.
[02:41:16.148 --> 02:41:17.189]  And they're there for revenge!
[02:41:17.229 --> 02:41:21.792]  I was playing some videos on my show just the other night of some of these Indian guys saying, well, you deserve it.
[02:41:21.832 --> 02:41:23.893]  We're here because of all of what you've done to us.
[02:41:23.933 --> 02:41:24.774]  So we're here to do this.
[02:41:25.254 --> 02:41:28.536]  So they're framing this kind of confrontation, and that's what these movies are for.
[02:41:28.556 --> 02:41:29.897]  Like you said, they're for the dumbest of the dumb.
[02:41:29.917 --> 02:41:34.940]  They're for idiots to feel galvanized and justified in a future scenario that's going to unfold in front of them.
[02:41:34.960 --> 02:41:48.368]  They're going to already have this kind of foundational framework in their mind for what they're supposed to do and who the good guys are, who the bad guys are, because that's, you know as much as anyone, that's how people, that's how our enemies frame reality to their subjects.
[02:41:48.388 --> 02:41:49.913]   They don't learn from Absolutely!
[02:41:49.933 --> 02:41:50.573]  Thank you for the interview.
[02:41:50.412 --> 02:41:53.692]   with the world anymore. You learn who's bad and who's good from your television,
[02:41:53.692 --> 02:41:56.612]   from these from these screens that we have in front of our faces every single
[02:41:56.612 --> 02:41:59.331]   day. That's totally curated and controlled by the enemy. It's going to
[02:41:59.331 --> 02:42:01.452]  tell you what's real, who's good, who's bad. Absolutely.
[02:42:01.452 --> 02:42:03.931]  Jeremy MacKenzie, thank you for the interview.
[02:42:03.931 --> 02:42:11.012]   It's not often we talk to the Emperor of Diagonaline. I'm going to tell you what's on my mind.
[02:42:09.201 --> 02:42:18.526]  The only thing on American I'm hearing is the constant parade of attacks by your foul-mouthed, flea-bitten listeners against our noble president.
[02:42:19.226 --> 02:42:21.067]  I am a Biden believer.
[02:42:21.548 --> 02:42:22.888]  And here's what's going to go down in 24.
[02:42:24.289 --> 02:42:30.011]  Biden's going to walk away again, wiping the floor with Trump like he did in 2020.
[02:42:30.291 --> 02:42:32.752]  Because America believes in Biden.
[02:42:33.073 --> 02:42:35.574]  Hollywood believes in Biden, like Mark Hamill.
[02:42:35.994 --> 02:42:41.196]  And we all know that Trump is going to try to cheat, but it's going to go down in flames.
[02:42:41.256 --> 02:42:44.357]  And all I hear is the anger and the bitter in your alcoholic lips.
[02:42:44.497 --> 02:42:46.439]  I want to talk right to your listeners right now.
[02:42:46.278 --> 02:42:52.997]   the terms with the end of white cisgender Christian America as we rise, rise, the pink
[02:42:52.997 --> 02:42:59.478]   haired warriors, the non-binary warriors, the transgenders, we're rising and we're
[02:42:59.478 --> 02:43:04.198]   gonna sweep you aside. I want to talk right to your listeners right now, the frightened
[02:43:04.198 --> 02:43:10.438]   middle-aged white man clinging to his guns and his religion and his money and his privilege.
[02:43:10.438 --> 02:43:16.438]   Get ready baby, because pretty soon you will be swept aside in the new order of things.
[02:43:16.406 --> 02:43:17.808]  And you know what that new order is?
[02:43:18.249 --> 02:43:23.776]  It's going to be a beautiful, wonderful utopia where we all come together and live together.
[02:43:24.077 --> 02:43:26.139]  And yes, there will be communism.
[02:43:26.440 --> 02:43:31.260]   Yes, there will be Sharia law because you don't understand queers for
[02:43:31.260 --> 02:43:34.139]  Palestine together forever strong.
[02:43:34.139 --> 02:43:41.660]   We are coming together in a coalition one big great big coalition that will win a day
[02:43:41.660 --> 02:43:49.819]   and in 2024 when you're all crying when you're all just so broken up because you've lost again.
[02:43:50.074 --> 02:44:00.405]  It's a new dawn in America with a rainbow, a transgender rainbow sweeping across the land to sweep you aside into obscurity.
[02:44:00.425 --> 02:44:05.870]  The time of the white cisgendered man is over.
[02:44:06.531 --> 02:44:09.174]  Your privilege card has been revoked.
[02:44:10.009 --> 02:44:14.411]  You will accept the new refugees, the new Americans.
[02:44:14.851 --> 02:44:15.931]  And here's the secret.
[02:44:16.231 --> 02:44:17.212]  We're in charge.
[02:44:17.452 --> 02:44:18.953]  We tell you what to do.
[02:44:19.313 --> 02:44:20.273]  So get ready.
[02:44:20.593 --> 02:44:28.016]  Get ready to give up your guns, give up your gold, give up your privilege, and accept the way things are now.
[02:44:28.376 --> 02:44:32.438]  The pink-haired warriors are here, and we're not going anywhere.
[02:44:32.518 --> 02:44:35.119]  You will not legislate us out of existence.
[02:44:35.399 --> 02:44:38.361]  You will not put us back in the closet, and we will not be quiet.
[02:44:38.702 --> 02:44:42.785]  Free, free from your oppressive grip that you've had on us.
[02:44:42.845 --> 02:44:44.906]  And tell you what, I'm a Biden believer.
[02:44:45.427 --> 02:44:47.809]  When Biden smiles, the sun shines.
[02:44:48.109 --> 02:44:49.970]  When he weeps, the rain falls.
[02:44:50.291 --> 02:44:55.134]  His strong hands lift up the oppressed, and his foot stomps on the white supremacists.
[02:44:55.715 --> 02:44:57.917]  So this is how it's going to go down in 24.
[02:44:58.557 --> 02:45:02.941]  Joe Biden's going to be back for four more years, and then Kamala Harris for eight.
[02:45:03.721 --> 02:45:05.102]  And then Gavin Newsom.
[02:45:05.242 --> 02:45:06.462]  What do you think about that?
[02:45:07.682 --> 02:45:09.423]  All right, final segment with our guests.
[02:45:10.183 --> 02:45:11.764]  We've got Maria Z taking over here.
[02:45:11.784 --> 02:45:16.666]  I've got one more report I want to hit after our guest leaves us, but Jeremy McKenzie is on fire.
[02:45:17.206 --> 02:45:23.988]  He is the emperor of Diagonal On, the joke group that Canada's would-be dictator says is the most dangerous thing in Canada.
[02:45:24.388 --> 02:45:25.749]  Five minutes left, closing comments.
[02:45:27.793 --> 02:45:29.054]  Well, Cheryl, thanks for having me.
[02:45:29.094 --> 02:45:29.935]  I appreciate it.
[02:45:30.035 --> 02:45:31.516]  And yeah, say hi to Maria for me.
[02:45:31.556 --> 02:45:34.318]  I was actually, I talked to her last time I was on here, and she does a great job as well.
[02:45:35.339 --> 02:45:37.180]  Yeah, it's been wild up here.
[02:45:37.280 --> 02:45:37.961]  It's been pretty crazy.
[02:45:37.981 --> 02:45:40.403]  It hasn't stopped at all since the end of the trucker convoy.
[02:45:40.423 --> 02:45:43.005]  I've defeated four of the five criminal cases against me.
[02:45:43.025 --> 02:45:46.327]  We've got one left, my girlfriend and I, for protesting, if you can believe that.
[02:45:46.367 --> 02:45:48.829]  We're being, you know, dragged through trial for that.
[02:45:49.130 --> 02:45:50.671]  Probably in June, we'll see what happens.
[02:45:50.811 --> 02:45:55.775]  I don't expect it's going to turn out much different than any of the other trumped-up political cases that we've had, but we'll see.
[02:45:56.519 --> 02:45:56.899]  We'll see.
[02:45:57.380 --> 02:45:59.562]  We are going on tour this year, actually.
[02:46:00.243 --> 02:46:08.532]  It's had some legal hurdles and stuff to overcome, but we're going across the country starting this July, July 6th or 3rd, I think it's the 6th, in Ottawa.
[02:46:08.552 --> 02:46:11.235]  We're going all the way to the west coast and then all the way back east again.
[02:46:12.075 --> 02:46:21.775]   So that's tickets are on sale now for anybody that wants to show up and absorb whatever that's going to be. It's going to be a lot
[02:46:21.775 --> 02:46:25.255]   of fun. We're looking forward to networking the community and trying to tie people
[02:46:25.255 --> 02:46:30.335]   together and bringing some more sanity to this place. So you can go to thegriff.shop and
[02:46:30.335 --> 02:46:35.835]   you can find tickets there now. And ragingdistant.com is my website as well. You can get the links to stuff there
[02:46:35.835 --> 02:46:36.175]  too.
[02:46:36.192 --> 02:46:37.693]  It's not like North Korea where it's already in place.
[02:46:37.713 --> 02:46:40.255]  They're trying to put North Korean control in, in a once-free system with nice people.
[02:46:40.074 --> 02:46:44.213]   say that Canada is the best dark comedy that nobody's watching. At times it's
[02:46:44.213 --> 02:46:48.913]   truly horrifying and disgusting and frightening. People don't realize how fabulous the tyranny is.
[02:46:48.913 --> 02:46:52.294]   I mean it's not like North Korea where it's running in place. They're trying to put North
[02:46:52.294 --> 02:46:57.913]   Korea in control in a once free system with like nice people. It's wild. Yeah it's
[02:46:57.913 --> 02:47:00.953]   really crazy and they're really taking advantage of the Canadian sense of you
[02:47:00.953 --> 02:47:03.834]   know you don't rock the boat, be polite, just you know don't don't cause
[02:47:03.834 --> 02:47:06.994]   problems and that's just being taken for it's like somebody you know come over to
[02:47:06.994 --> 02:47:09.913]   your house you have a house party and people come over and then it's okay it's
[02:47:09.913 --> 02:47:12.513]   time to leave and they don't leave and then they just start taking things
[02:47:12.513 --> 02:47:15.833]   out of the fridge and having their way with your wife and they're like how
[02:47:15.833 --> 02:47:20.433]   long does this go on before you act and do anything about it?
[02:47:18.530 --> 02:47:21.231]  You can do nothing and it'll just get worse or you can do something about it.
[02:47:21.251 --> 02:47:26.873]  This is being done to us, it's not, you know, something we've done, it's our choice to respond to this or not.
[02:47:28.053 --> 02:47:29.394]  What's that famous Iliad?
[02:47:30.035 --> 02:47:32.997]  Who's the hero of the Iliad, that ancient book?
[02:47:33.698 --> 02:47:44.629]  It's Ulysses, and he comes on after being gone for 30 years, and they've taken over his house, his family's enslaved, it's implied they've been raping his wife, and he just kills them all.
[02:47:45.782 --> 02:47:50.667]  First he shoots the arrow through all the hatchets, the little hole in the hatchet, the one from memory.
[02:47:51.247 --> 02:47:55.911]  But he just kills them all right there, and I'm not saying we should do that, but where is Ulysses today?
[02:47:55.971 --> 02:47:57.373]  We politically have to kill this.
[02:47:59.924 --> 02:48:04.608]  I mean, best case scenario is, you know, it's a dark metaphor, but you strangle it in the cradle.
[02:48:04.628 --> 02:48:10.174]  Like, that's why I've been at the onset when this Communist Party, these people, these LARPing, these fools get up there.
[02:48:10.474 --> 02:48:12.996]  They think they, you know, that has to be destroyed immediately.
[02:48:13.076 --> 02:48:14.438]  Not, oh, well, we'll give it time.
[02:48:14.458 --> 02:48:18.201]  You don't wait until the fire has consumed the house to call the fire department.
[02:48:18.422 --> 02:48:19.282]  You do it immediately.
[02:48:19.362 --> 02:48:21.364]  As soon as there's a problem that you can't handle yourself.
[02:48:21.504 --> 02:48:23.887]  There's a grease fire, you put it out.
[02:48:25.485 --> 02:48:26.586]  Yeah, you don't let it fester.
[02:48:26.906 --> 02:48:31.809]  If you get cancer, you don't let it progress to stage 4 before you take any treatments.
[02:48:31.829 --> 02:48:33.590]  It's just common sense.
[02:48:34.010 --> 02:48:35.331]  And it's not like it doesn't have a track record.
[02:48:35.351 --> 02:48:36.791]  We have a massive history of this.
[02:48:36.952 --> 02:48:40.714]  It doesn't have to be called communism to be communism.
[02:48:40.734 --> 02:48:42.475]  And that is what they're bringing in across the world.
[02:48:42.615 --> 02:48:46.357]  It's globalist-directed control using a communist template.
[02:48:47.358 --> 02:49:00.089]  You could call it neo-communism, I guess, but it's really, again, at the foundation, at the core of it, it's the spirit of malevolence, it's of control, it's of enslavement, and it's of punishment to people that won't follow along.
[02:49:00.189 --> 02:49:01.470]  Isn't that the face of the devil?
[02:49:01.510 --> 02:49:02.111]  Isn't that what he says?
[02:49:02.131 --> 02:49:04.693]  You have to worship me and worship the ground I walk on or I'll destroy you.
[02:49:04.713 --> 02:49:05.714]  That's all he asks in return.
[02:49:05.734 --> 02:49:08.796]  He'll give you everything you want as long as you just worship him and do whatever he says.
[02:49:09.096 --> 02:49:11.495]  disobedience is punished severely.
[02:49:11.495 --> 02:49:16.056]   So, you know, that's kind of the world we're going into and everywhere you go, the end of private property,
[02:49:16.056 --> 02:49:19.176]   they've already, you know, destroyed the firearms ability of people here in this country.
[02:49:19.176 --> 02:49:22.096]   Now they're coming out for speech and they're indoctrinating our kids in school.
[02:49:22.096 --> 02:49:25.336]   Literally, they're going out, they've got these booths and pamphlets and everything.
[02:49:25.336 --> 02:49:28.096]  So all signs point to, you know, trouble ahead.
[02:49:28.096 --> 02:49:30.377]  And all I've been trying to do is warn people of that.
[02:49:30.377 --> 02:49:34.456]   And because I feel like I would be grossly irresponsible and, you know, terrible of me.
[02:49:34.009 --> 02:49:34.909]  Hell of trouble ahead!
[02:49:34.929 --> 02:49:36.670]  You're already an example of tyranny.
[02:49:37.110 --> 02:49:38.430]  Great people in Canada, it's so sad.
[02:49:38.730 --> 02:49:40.471]  Jerry McKenzie, we'll talk to you again soon.
[02:49:40.491 --> 02:49:47.553]  And again, the best website for people to find you is RagingDissident.com.
[02:49:47.573 --> 02:49:48.173]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:49:49.557 --> 02:49:50.738]  Thank you very much Alex, appreciate it.
[02:49:51.058 --> 02:49:51.658]  Alright, thank you.
[02:49:51.678 --> 02:49:52.719]  Maria Z is coming up.
[02:49:52.759 --> 02:49:53.919]  I got one more story to head.
[02:49:54.440 --> 02:49:55.861]  Straight ahead, it's really important.
[02:49:55.921 --> 02:49:58.002]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:49:58.042 --> 02:49:59.603]  Follow me on X at RealAlexJones.
[02:49:59.903 --> 02:50:00.643]  That's really important.
[02:50:00.683 --> 02:50:02.244]  RealAlexJones on X. Follow me there.
[02:50:02.264 --> 02:50:06.146]  Alright, I'm going to do a few minutes here, air a special report ahead of the time.
[02:50:06.186 --> 02:50:10.348]  The great Maria Z from Australia coming up in about 50 minutes, 52 minutes from now.
[02:50:10.469 --> 02:50:12.250]  Owen Schroer takes over.
[02:50:13.370 --> 02:50:16.452]  Please remember that I can't do this without you.
[02:50:17.410 --> 02:50:20.154]  And I just want you to follow us at ExitRealAlexJones.
[02:50:20.514 --> 02:50:22.236]  I want you to share the articles and videos.
[02:50:23.318 --> 02:50:25.701]  We'll know in the next few weeks whether they're going to shut down InfoWars.
[02:50:25.761 --> 02:50:27.123]  It'll take a few months to shut it down.
[02:50:27.763 --> 02:50:29.365]  But people think that's hype.
[02:50:29.425 --> 02:50:30.327]  Just watch and see.
[02:50:30.367 --> 02:50:30.707]  I'd say...
[02:50:32.003 --> 02:50:33.244]  50% chance they're going to shut it down.
[02:50:33.644 --> 02:50:35.005]  And it's a lot of inside baseball.
[02:50:35.065 --> 02:50:37.726]  I keep saying I'm going to cover it on air and do a whole hour on it.
[02:50:37.866 --> 02:50:39.487]  I will, maybe tomorrow, maybe the next day.
[02:50:39.627 --> 02:50:42.849]  I just, I'm meeting with lawyers today to see all the things I should cover.
[02:50:43.630 --> 02:50:47.632]  But this is all part of the climate we're in right now and how serious the situation is.
[02:50:47.652 --> 02:50:48.392]  Look what they're doing to Trump.
[02:50:49.073 --> 02:50:51.634]  They're coming after everybody behind the scenes, folks, that's prominent.
[02:50:52.074 --> 02:50:53.115]  So I need your support.
[02:50:53.175 --> 02:50:57.677]  So share the articles, share the videos, let folks know we're under attack because you're under attack.
[02:50:59.178 --> 02:51:00.119]  And support our sponsor.

[02:51:53.154 --> 02:51:57.578]  And hopefully things pan out and the judge does the right thing and all this stuff, but it doesn't look good.
[02:51:58.018 --> 02:51:58.959]  I'm not going to lie to the crew.
[02:51:58.979 --> 02:52:02.102]  I always told them years ago, oh, we'll hold on, but you know, you got time.
[02:52:02.142 --> 02:52:05.165]  It'll be, you know, and now I'm telling the crew, hey, this is the way it is.
[02:52:05.226 --> 02:52:10.311]  So 30 years on air here, InfoWars 27 years since I started the website.
[02:52:12.674 --> 02:52:21.558]  This is an emblematic sign of how much trouble we're all in, but also how powerful we are that they are desperate to not want money, they want us off air.
[02:52:21.998 --> 02:52:25.440]  So go to drjonesnaturals.com right now, drjonesnaturals.com.

[02:52:28.862 --> 02:52:31.043]  They make the announcement, they're going to start liquidation, shut us down.
[02:52:31.243 --> 02:52:33.044]  They'll ship all the product, it'll be open for months.
[02:52:34.144 --> 02:52:37.886]  Who knows, they may kick me off right away and just shut the show off, but any orders you've got are going to go in.
[02:52:38.386 --> 02:52:44.826]   Infowarsstore.com, the ultimate fish oil, all the great products that are there.

[02:52:53.485 --> 02:52:54.845]  It's a piece of history.
[02:52:54.845 --> 02:52:56.444]  When you buy the books, I actually get some of that.
[02:52:56.444 --> 02:52:58.245]  It actually helps me with what's gonna happen in the future.
[02:52:58.245 --> 02:53:02.986]   So get my books, The Great Reset, The War for the World, and the newest book, The Great Awakening,

[02:53:07.706 --> 02:53:16.940]   888-253-3139 Here is a John Bowne report that is extremely important that I hope that you will share.
[02:53:16.980 --> 02:53:19.541]  And it's got the right headline, let me tell you.
[02:53:19.561 --> 02:53:21.761]  It's also on InfoWars.com.
[02:53:21.841 --> 02:53:23.202]  All hell is going to break loose.
[02:53:23.222 --> 02:53:25.542]  It's already broken loose, but it's about to really break loose.
[02:53:25.581 --> 02:53:42.501]  It's a short report and then Maria Z takes over.
[02:53:42.807 --> 02:53:48.949]  According to the FBI, Chinese hackers have prepared a barrage of imminent strikes on critical U.S.
[02:53:49.029 --> 02:53:49.789]  infrastructure.
[02:53:50.069 --> 02:53:53.931]  The purpose of the hacking was not to gather intelligence.
[02:53:55.011 --> 02:54:02.794]  The purpose was to install malware that once activated would disrupt or damage the infrastructure.
[02:54:03.433 --> 02:54:16.021]  Meanwhile, the effects of China's biological warfare via COVID-19 and the resulting now blatant evidence of a genocidal vaccine rollout of epic proportions enters a new chapter.
[02:54:16.441 --> 02:54:19.784]  The Australian Bureau of Statistics is a statistical agency.
[02:54:20.664 --> 02:54:30.292]  It see it shows its own figures now show around about 26,000 deaths excess deaths for 2022 and no one is asking why.
[02:54:30.312 --> 02:54:36.778]  Another conspiracy theory becomes reality as AstraZeneca is now pulling its COVID vaccine from the market.
[02:54:37.038 --> 02:54:44.823]   They know exactly what they're doing and it is self-assembling Nanotech in the body.
[02:54:45.243 --> 02:54:54.568]  And we were finding this stuff decades ago, but right when they rolled out the COVID hysteria four years ago, we had all the literature and they were keeping secret what was in the Pfizer shots and the Moderna shots and the rest of it.
[02:54:55.789 --> 02:55:01.812]  But whistleblowers actually released, it's later been confirmed, what was in it and it was a giant test.
[02:55:01.832 --> 02:55:06.074]  They were changing thousands of times at Moderna and Pfizer run by the Pentagon.
[02:55:06.254 --> 02:55:07.195]  They were just front companies.
[02:55:08.776 --> 02:55:12.198]  What they were putting in it, they were testing all sorts of stuff.
[02:55:13.180 --> 02:55:13.941]  Ebola!
[02:55:14.201 --> 02:55:15.722]  Marburg!
[02:55:15.802 --> 02:55:17.042]  All sorts of bird flesh!
[02:55:17.903 --> 02:55:41.518]  As Natural News reports, world-renowned Belgian virologist Dr. Geert van den Bosch predicted a soon-coming massive tsunami of illness and death among those who got vaccinated, unleashing a wave of long COVID that will overwhelm the healthcare sector, not to mention the economy-wide impact in terms of eventual total economic failure and social chaos.
[02:55:41.878 --> 02:55:43.801]  The truth will surface.
[02:55:44.421 --> 02:55:50.369]  This has been a large-scale experiment of gain of function.
[02:55:51.542 --> 02:55:53.003]  On the very human population.
[02:55:53.504 --> 02:56:00.489]  As the lights are turned on and the vaccine roaches are scurrying, the panic goes live and the big guns are put into play.
[02:56:00.829 --> 02:56:13.979]  As Adan Salazar reported, a top meteorologist is warning government weather modification could unintentionally spark conflicts between nations where weather would be used in warfare among countries.
[02:56:14.239 --> 02:56:20.804]  Floods, droughts and wildfires last year were just a preview of what is to come.
[02:56:21.244 --> 02:56:35.712]  According to Kister's senior meteorologist John Jacques, the cloud-seeding debacle that precipitated the Dubai floods should serve as a reminder that government influence on the weather can lead to consequences that aren't fully predictable.
[02:56:36.193 --> 02:56:47.359]  Jacques says if we're not careful, unrestrained use of this technology could end up causing diplomatic instabilities with neighboring countries engaging in tit-for-tat weather wars.
[02:56:47.799 --> 02:56:51.801]  Meanwhile, the next plandemic begins to rear its ugly head.
[02:56:51.881 --> 02:56:53.302]  You say the next pandemic.
[02:56:53.342 --> 02:56:54.482]  There will be another pandemic.
[02:56:54.682 --> 02:56:55.263]  Absolutely.
[02:56:55.303 --> 02:56:56.083]  We don't know when.
[02:56:56.103 --> 02:57:00.705]  You know, the risk per year, two percent, three percent.
[02:57:00.905 --> 02:57:09.789]  Do we have the capability to ensure that we don't see another pandemic the like of which we saw while you were leading the World Health Organization?
[02:57:13.979 --> 02:57:14.199]  Yeah.
[02:57:14.539 --> 02:57:22.124]  Virologists explain that H5N1 or bird flu has mutated and can now spread more easily among mammals.
[02:57:22.464 --> 02:57:28.428]  They also warn that an outbreak in the human population could be a hundred times worse than COVID-19.
[02:57:28.628 --> 02:57:32.951]  And a bird flu pandemic could kill 50% of those infected.
[02:57:33.011 --> 02:57:41.436]  That virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans and then critically the ability to go from human to human transmission.
[02:57:41.776 --> 02:57:49.358]  And we know that in the rare cases, I think off the top of my head, four or five hundred cases so far of humans, the mortality rate is extraordinarily high.
[02:57:49.879 --> 02:58:04.363]  And as the Chinese develop weaponized Ebola, giving a group of hamsters distinct secretions in their eyes, a scabbing over the eyeballs, it ensures that if unleashed in the Western world, we will know where it came from.
[02:58:04.683 --> 02:58:10.505]  Meanwhile, the PREP Act has been quietly updated to include Ebola and Marburg disease.
[02:58:11.085 --> 02:58:29.954]  Add to that the Soros-funded communist college jackbooting summer awaiting us, incoming CBDCs, nuclear war on a hair trigger, uniparty-backed Orwellian speech laws, and Biden's illegal voting bloc leading up to an unprecedented presidential election.
[02:58:30.294 --> 02:58:32.255]  All hell is gonna break loose.
[02:58:32.515 --> 02:58:35.434]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.
[02:58:35.434 --> 02:58:40.115]  [MUSIC]
[02:58:40.115 --> 02:58:45.515]   Very important and let me say timely video from John Bowne there,
[02:58:45.515 --> 02:58:51.495]   because we are actually going to be discussing some of the capabilities
[02:58:51.495 --> 02:58:57.234]   of the nanotechnology that has been injected into humanity today.
[02:58:55.589 --> 02:59:11.053]   As per Dr Anna Miheich's own words, I think that people need to understand how multifaceted and advanced the technologies are that are now in everyone's blood.
[02:59:11.133 --> 02:59:14.555]  And so we have some new revelations to discuss today.
[02:59:14.615 --> 02:59:16.236]  Dr. Anna Mahajan joins me now.
[02:59:16.336 --> 02:59:18.277]  Thank you, Dr. Mahajan, for being here.
[02:59:19.497 --> 02:59:21.278]  Thank you so much for having me, Maria.
[02:59:22.739 --> 02:59:23.919]  It's great to have you again.
[02:59:23.939 --> 02:59:31.550]   We need to really discuss this, I guess, changing Nanotechnology.
[02:59:31.610 --> 02:59:37.236]  I've been interviewing people that are showing that it's clearly advancing.
[02:59:37.396 --> 02:59:38.978]  It's clearly evolving.
[02:59:38.998 --> 02:59:40.780]  The human blood is changing.
[02:59:40.840 --> 02:59:48.647]   We now have what appears to be synthetic cells in the blood, synthetic Materials coming out of people's urine.
[02:59:49.087 --> 03:00:06.377]  This is really very different to what we saw in the beginning and I suppose that this is in line with your findings of these messagens and the fact that these are plasmonic liquid crystal nanomachines that can be used for soft robotics.
[03:00:06.478 --> 03:00:09.519]  So, you've got a lot of research you want to unpack today.
[03:00:09.539 --> 03:00:12.121]  You start and we'll follow on.
[03:00:13.863 --> 03:00:14.364]  Absolutely.
[03:00:14.404 --> 03:00:15.505]  So thanks so much.
[03:00:16.025 --> 03:00:28.076]  What has been very clear is that the nanotechnology is self-assembling and that it is evolving and that the amounts we see in the blood is exponentially growing.
[03:00:28.197 --> 03:00:36.424]  And what I mean is also the unvaccinated, because what I've been saying from the beginning is that this technology does shed.
[03:00:36.444 --> 03:00:38.026]  It is self-spreading.
[03:00:38.647 --> 03:00:55.654]  And that now these symptoms of what people call long COVID, I call it the disease of self-assembling nanotechnology, because these technologies, they can contain payloads, but they can also assemble into technology.
[03:00:55.834 --> 03:01:13.720]   And one of the things that you and I have discussed a lot is the idea of hacking humans and making cyborgs, creating automatons, And now, in my research, I've been documenting self-assembling mesogens.
[03:01:13.820 --> 03:01:14.580]  What are these?
[03:01:14.640 --> 03:01:22.922]  So these are DNA-like biosensors that are also literally able to create antennas.
[03:01:23.042 --> 03:01:25.723]  They are able to genetically modify people.
[03:01:26.163 --> 03:01:31.105]   They are able to act in a way that Absolutely agree with you.
[03:01:30.924 --> 03:01:36.045]   brain-computer interface, the fusion of humanity is happening. So those that are
[03:01:36.045 --> 03:01:40.125]   heavily shattered upon are also affected and it's important to understand if we
[03:01:40.125 --> 03:01:49.164]   want to save the natural human species that is unmodified then these
[03:01:49.164 --> 03:01:54.603]   are topics that we have to address. Absolutely agree with you. Tim, can you
[03:01:54.603 --> 03:01:57.084]  bring up the third link that I sent you please?
[03:01:57.084 --> 03:02:05.084]   Ido Bachelet and his 100,000 sorry 1,000 billion nano robots
[03:02:03.268 --> 03:02:05.489]  This is a report that I actually was alerted to.
[03:02:05.509 --> 03:02:10.270]  Dr. Mahaicha Cross promoted the Outrage Humans sub-stack.
[03:02:10.970 --> 03:02:32.301]   The article is called The Emergence of Nanobot Society, and if you can just show that first page, team, it's the third link that I sent through, where Ido Bachelet of Bar-Ilan University in Israel In 2013, bragged about the fact that they can fit 1,000, it's not that article team, it's the third link that I sent through.
[03:02:32.481 --> 03:02:39.805]  It's outraged newsletter, The Emergence of Nanobot Society, and it's got Professor Ida Bachelet holding up a syringe.
[03:02:40.545 --> 03:02:53.798]   And in that article, in his presentation in 2013, that's the one, he talks about the fact that they can fit 1,000 billion nanorobots into a vaccine, In that same...
[03:02:54.740 --> 03:03:04.804]  In that same presentation, he talks about the fact that then they essentially hook these humans up to computers and they can control them remotely, like with an Xbox controller.
[03:03:04.844 --> 03:03:20.091]  But we're now talking about AI being in the mix, Dr. Mahecha, and potentially not even needing a joystick of sorts where, you know, if the NOAA is hooking up their systems to AI, and so is everyone else, what makes us think the pharmaceutical industry isn't?
[03:03:20.611 --> 03:03:27.320]   And so it's absolutely possible to fit 1,000 billion robots into these injections.
[03:03:27.620 --> 03:03:30.422]  Pfizer partnered with IDO Bachelet in 2015.
[03:03:30.582 --> 03:03:34.463]  If anyone hasn't seen that report, I did a full report on this.
[03:03:34.763 --> 03:03:41.786]  It's got tens of thousands of views across all platforms, hundreds of thousands across platforms.
[03:03:42.166 --> 03:03:44.847]  So very, very important.
[03:03:45.047 --> 03:03:46.708]  That is what IDO was showing at the time.
[03:03:46.748 --> 03:03:51.030]  But we are now at the point where this is so much more advanced, Dr. Mahajir.
[03:03:51.090 --> 03:03:53.871]  So I'm very, very concerned.
[03:03:55.765 --> 03:04:09.617]  Yes, and I've been showing under the microscope, you know, micro robots and nano robots and how they self assemble and really how the blood is being transformed into a polymer mesh network.
[03:04:09.677 --> 03:04:15.682]  And these robots are literally in charge of transforming the human blood.
[03:04:15.742 --> 03:04:18.885]  They're using the human blood as an energy source.
[03:04:18.925 --> 03:04:25.711]   So they are in the process of harvesting the energy are creating these rubbery clots and
[03:04:25.711 --> 03:04:33.651]   I filmed that as well as that they are this bidirectional telemetry they are able
[03:04:33.651 --> 03:04:42.611]   to absolutely be able to externally be controlled but also that they are
[03:04:42.611 --> 03:04:46.681]   creating this roll formation exactly what you're seeing in this video
[03:04:46.681 --> 03:04:53.931]   that's a micro robot right there and these things are multiplying at a rate that
[03:04:53.931 --> 03:04:56.991]   is extraordinary
[03:04:55.632 --> 03:05:14.237]  And Ray Kurzweil discussed that self-assembling nanotechnology that is uncontrolled and self-replicating is really an extraordinary threat to humanity because even those who have developed this stuff cannot control these nanorobots.
[03:05:14.457 --> 03:05:46.552]   And so that's really of concern because if we think about that humanity now has these things swimming in their blood, you can see here exactly in these spheres, How the robots are moving and they are creating these polymers that again are part of technology but they're also part of the synthetic biology fusion and the clots and that all of that is then hijacking the human life force and human electricity causing all diseases of aging so you have
[03:05:46.932 --> 03:05:50.354]  This accelerated aging process, even in the unvaccinated.
[03:05:50.834 --> 03:06:01.160]  And I am very concerned because unless people wake up to this threat, you know, we are as humanity facing an extinction level event.
[03:06:01.521 --> 03:06:02.641]  This stuff sheds.
[03:06:02.801 --> 03:06:07.564]  So people in their social interactions, they are affected.
[03:06:07.724 --> 03:06:18.614]   And the more they are Affected by it, the more it replicates and the more you see of it in the blood and then diseases also happen.
[03:06:18.854 --> 03:06:24.800]  What you see here is amazing footage of an extremely fast swimming micro robot.
[03:06:25.060 --> 03:06:34.849]  I mean, if you don't think this is artificial intelligence, look at how fast they are able to coordinate around these red blood cells.
[03:06:36.306 --> 03:06:42.329]  I'm moving my microscopy board extremely fast to be able to just follow them.
[03:06:42.349 --> 03:06:46.972]  They seem very intelligent, Dr. Anna.
[03:06:46.992 --> 03:06:48.693]  They're literally navigating.
[03:06:48.733 --> 03:06:51.835]  Tim, if you can keep this video on loop for a little bit.
[03:06:52.615 --> 03:06:57.658]  They seem to be navigating very, very intelligently around the red blood cells.
[03:06:58.937 --> 03:07:03.899]  Absolutely, and what Ray Kurzweil discussed was these micro-robots.
[03:07:03.959 --> 03:07:06.920]  They are literally computers on their own.
[03:07:06.980 --> 03:07:17.365]  They now have the capacity, and I showed this in my analysis of the mesogen, that there is quantum computing capability, at least in terms of the polymers.
[03:07:17.465 --> 03:07:37.753]   And so these robots also, if you think about interaction with electromagnetic field or these pulsed microwaves that we've seen reports for, you know, what are they And we know that they can also affect the brain and even connect through nanowires, what's called a connectome, this brain-computer interface.
[03:07:37.793 --> 03:07:48.076]  They can modulate our brain function even without our knowing, because people don't necessarily know that there's stuff in their blood unless you look at it.
[03:07:48.176 --> 03:07:54.879]  But all of a sudden, you know, they're changing, they're more tired, they have all kinds of medical symptoms and they can't think.
[03:07:55.960 --> 03:08:06.428]  And I believe that this is weaponized nanotechnology that was clearly deployed under the cover of these COVID-19 shots and it is used to create Humanity 2.0.
[03:08:07.089 --> 03:08:16.157]  And I want to remind everyone that the technocratic transhumanist plan is to create Humanity 3.0, which means that no human will be alive and only robots will be left.
[03:08:20.393 --> 03:08:22.374]  We can take off that video now.
[03:08:22.915 --> 03:08:29.739]  You were saying the goal is not even Human 2.0, it's Human 3.0, and no humanity will be left.
[03:08:29.779 --> 03:08:30.880]  Just elaborate on that.
[03:08:32.140 --> 03:08:45.489]  So this was Ray Kurzweil, who's really an unofficial spokesperson for this movement, and he wrote in his book, The Singularity is Near, in 2005, everything about these nanorobots.
[03:08:45.849 --> 03:09:14.000]   He clearly discussed that by 2020, We will have these nanorobots floating around in our blood, that they will modify humans without their knowing, that they will change how the brain is operating, and literally that these robots will be able to 3D print and take over genetic material, print out any polymer or other electronic devices inside of the body.
[03:09:14.080 --> 03:09:16.321]  Well, that's exactly what I'm seeing!
[03:09:16.801 --> 03:09:19.923]  Dr. Anna, let me make sure I heard you correctly.
[03:09:19.742 --> 03:09:26.942]   I think that we really need to pay attention because they have this predictive programming
[03:09:26.942 --> 03:09:30.341]   aspect that they're telling us exactly what they're doing and guess what?
[03:09:30.341 --> 03:09:31.341]  They're doing it.
[03:09:31.341 --> 03:09:36.502]  Dr. Anna, let me make sure I heard you correctly.
[03:09:36.502 --> 03:09:38.421]  We're talking about these.
[03:09:38.421 --> 03:09:42.822]   I mean, I wanted to talk to you about the topic of self-replication because people may
[03:09:42.822 --> 03:09:45.261]  not necessarily understand how that happens.
[03:09:45.518 --> 03:09:58.249]  You're saying these nanorobots are essentially 3D printing the matter that they want inside the human body, and is this the method in which they're achieving this self-replication?
[03:09:58.309 --> 03:10:03.373]  People will think, okay, well, if we've been injected with nanorobots, how are they actually multiplying?
[03:10:04.781 --> 03:10:19.028]  So in 2004, there was a study by NASA and they already have created this kinematic automata that were able to self-replicate at that time.
[03:10:19.368 --> 03:10:27.071]  Self-replication means that these nanomaterials and nanorobots, they can create a copy of itself.
[03:10:27.291 --> 03:10:30.513]  And that's been available for a long time.
[03:10:31.353 --> 03:10:41.800]  Robert Freitas, who is a colleague of Kurzweil and who's really a leader in cryogenics, extreme life extension, nanotechnology.
[03:10:42.141 --> 03:10:48.285]  He always has been warning against the self-replication, but what we see in the blood is exactly that.
[03:10:49.145 --> 03:10:54.629]  Look at these little tiny robots and what they can build in the blood.
[03:10:54.709 --> 03:10:58.692]  Clearly over the past year there has been a significant worsening about what we see in the blood.
[03:10:58.812 --> 03:11:02.215]  Other researchers have confirmed this around the world.
[03:11:02.235 --> 03:11:04.737]  I'm not the only one who's saying this.
[03:11:06.497 --> 03:11:17.260]  But I've been filming the robots in very particular ways because I want to tell people it's like this has grown from the nanoscale, it's growing larger and larger until it's microscopic.
[03:11:17.840 --> 03:11:51.634]   And so it is absolutely for real and this self-replication, you know, it is also written about as the great goose scenario, you know, could potentially cause an extinction level event to our biosphere because You're never allowed to have self-replication uncontrolled in a biosystem because it will just take over all of the energy in the system and ultimately nothing is left but the robots and the host is dead.
[03:11:53.916 --> 03:12:04.846]   Mike Adams did a live microscopy On InfoWars of some of these white structures that were being found inside of human beings.
[03:12:05.347 --> 03:12:14.593]  He then went and analysed it, found very high amounts, higher than should be in the body of conductive metals and other materials that we just shouldn't have.
[03:12:15.614 --> 03:12:18.436]  And no doubt this is absolutely changing.
[03:12:18.456 --> 03:12:33.532]   You've spoken about the fact that there are, it's essentially Programmable matter, as in hydrogel, polymers, things that are used inside programmable technology.
[03:12:33.572 --> 03:12:36.595]  So we want to talk more about that right after the break.
[03:12:36.675 --> 03:12:37.436]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:12:37.516 --> 03:12:38.877]  Share this broadcast everywhere.
[03:12:38.917 --> 03:12:40.318]  This is so crucial, everyone.
[03:12:40.619 --> 03:12:41.319]  We'll be right back.
[03:12:41.960 --> 03:12:43.741]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:12:43.822 --> 03:12:49.527]  I'm your guest host, Maria Zee, and we are unfortunately discussing something so horrific today.
[03:12:50.853 --> 03:12:58.257]  But I have to really give credit to InfoWars and some of the outlets that weren't afraid to discuss nanotechnology from the beginning.
[03:12:58.317 --> 03:13:04.139]  I said that I predicted that within about one year we would start seeing this entering the mainstream.
[03:13:04.239 --> 03:13:16.285]  It's actually happened sooner than that, with recent admissions from outlets here in Australia saying that the new cancer mRNA injections are going to have a GPS-like signal inside the host.
[03:13:16.755 --> 03:13:29.762]  And so they're actually starting to publish this now to normalise the fact that people are becoming living antennas and they want you to accept that through a quote-unquote cancer vaccine.
[03:13:30.202 --> 03:13:33.824]  And so a huge, huge amount of credit to InfoWars.
[03:13:33.904 --> 03:13:44.089]  Please support them and support the outlets that aren't afraid to touch this information because up until, I would say very recently, it's been very taboo to talk about it.
[03:13:44.429 --> 03:13:53.953]  But people are starting to understand this actually has occurred as the evidence mounts and Dr. Anna Mihaiča has been instrumental in bringing that evidence forward to humanity.
[03:13:53.993 --> 03:13:56.934]  So we're thankful for her and for her time today.
[03:13:56.994 --> 03:14:03.377]  Dr. Mihaiča, I want to ask you about something because you wrote an article and team if you can bring that article up.
[03:14:03.437 --> 03:14:06.338]  It's the second link, Dark Field Live Microscopy.
[03:14:07.046 --> 03:14:13.389]  Of a discoid messagen self-assembly nanotechnology device in C19 unvaccinated blood.
[03:14:13.529 --> 03:14:24.015]  In this article, you are talking about the different self-assembly nanotechnology for the human-machine interface that is being deployed against humanity.
[03:14:24.355 --> 03:14:30.398]  Dr. Mahecha, can you talk us through this, the global brain chip and connecting people to the hive mind, please?
[03:14:31.738 --> 03:14:56.908]  Yes, so the global brain chip was really the research of Dr. Hildegard Stanninger, who is a world-renowned nanotoxicologist and expert in these advanced nanomaterials, who in 2012 wrote a book about her findings and analysis of chips that came out of targeted individuals that she chemically analyzed.
[03:14:57.680 --> 03:15:18.244]  And she explained that mesogens are DNA sensors and smart materials that, even at that time, were injected into people either by means, for example, of micro weapons or, for example, nanotechnology from Morgellons disease.
[03:15:18.604 --> 03:15:24.285]  But these people, for example, had developed tumors like meningiomas.
[03:15:24.325 --> 03:15:29.766]  She analyzed it and it was made from these polymer materials with metals in them.
[03:15:29.826 --> 03:15:30.926]  They were conductive.
[03:15:31.567 --> 03:15:36.788]  And specifically out of Morgellons victims came what's called mesogens.
[03:15:36.848 --> 03:15:43.029]  And it looks like a little plastic chip, a little bit strange.
[03:15:43.129 --> 03:15:49.173]   Sometimes it has multiple colors in it, but there are antennas in there
[03:15:49.173 --> 03:15:55.093]   that are able to transmit information and ultimately also mind control people.
[03:15:55.093 --> 03:16:03.212]   So I started looking at the blood and documenting the self-assembly of the nanotechnology
[03:16:03.212 --> 03:16:07.253]  and I started to see very similar structures.
[03:16:07.253 --> 03:16:14.654]   And then I did deep dives in terms of how polymers can self-assemble as nano wires.
[03:16:14.676 --> 03:16:17.137]  They use semiconducting capabilities.
[03:16:17.457 --> 03:16:19.038]  They can build capacitors.
[03:16:19.098 --> 03:16:30.264]  They have different antennas, for example, that have what's called chiral optical properties, meaning that they can work through optical photonic signals.
[03:16:30.904 --> 03:16:40.998]   And what this also means is that, for example, There are these nanowires that can connect with these quantum dot-like micro-robots because they become part
[03:16:41.495 --> 03:16:47.395]   of these structures, but ultimately, what is important for people to understand
[03:16:47.395 --> 03:16:53.495]   is that those who's been heavily shattered upon now have the same technology in them.
[03:16:53.495 --> 03:17:00.875]   And this is what I really want to raise the alarm about because again, what we said earlier,
[03:17:00.875 --> 03:17:06.435]   they want to transform all of humanity, absolute surveillance of every cell.
[03:17:06.435 --> 03:17:13.995]   We've talked before that they wanna digitize every microbe, every living organism and genetically engineer it
[03:17:13.995 --> 03:17:16.095]  and fuse it with synthetic biology.
[03:17:16.318 --> 03:17:27.647]  So the issue with having these mesogens and electronic devices that are used for soft robotics in our blood, it means that the unvaccinated are changing too.
[03:17:28.007 --> 03:17:32.871]  And we are literally fighting for the survival of the natural human species.
[03:17:34.221 --> 03:17:36.023]  It's absolutely catastrophic.
[03:17:36.744 --> 03:17:43.971]  I want to talk to you about a couple of points there and sort of the real world applications because you mentioned mind control.
[03:17:44.011 --> 03:17:51.920]  We have Rand Corporation who've said, you know, we're going to be able to coerce and manipulate human beings to do things that they wouldn't normally want to do.
[03:17:52.340 --> 03:17:56.785]  We have Yuval Noah Harari that made statements saying that humans are hackable animals.
[03:17:57.148 --> 03:18:01.012]  That wasn't said in, you know, it wasn't a tongue-in-cheek comment.
[03:18:01.052 --> 03:18:02.073]  He means that.
[03:18:03.214 --> 03:18:11.261]  You mentioned the use of photonics and the use of, you know, technology even through what we see.
[03:18:11.622 --> 03:18:21.071]   That field, you can look at optogenetics and look at the fact that they figured out how to change our genes Through light, through the light that goes into our eyes.
[03:18:21.111 --> 03:18:37.106]  This is why Biden banned incandescent lights, why they only want LEDs, because this links to the smart grid, this links to the internet of everything, and they can continue to modify your genes through the light that is being emitted in your environment.
[03:18:37.126 --> 03:18:38.728]  This is so, so serious.
[03:18:39.128 --> 03:19:09.317]   And this is, you know, Dr Maheitra, I've said a lot of times, if people don't understand the endgame of transhumanism, they really won't understand seemingly pointless things like banning incandescent lights when it's actually So serious to the human race to understand the reason behind that, because that partnered with the nanotechnology inside of people is a constant system upgrade, if you will, a constant powering of the human being, using the human as an antenna for the Internet of Everything.
[03:19:09.358 --> 03:19:18.383]  So let's talk about some of those real world applications, the Internet of Bodies, the Internet of Everything, and how the mind control exactly does occur.
[03:19:20.345 --> 03:19:29.174]  Yes, so we know that the engineers of the IEEE, they had also designed this whole idea of creating the metaverse.
[03:19:29.234 --> 03:19:42.709]  This is an idea that comes from the technocratic transhumanists, who are ultimately satanists, and they want to upload all digitized information into the cloud and create a virtual reality environment.
[03:19:43.369 --> 03:19:51.934]  So one of the things that they can do with these nanorobotics is basically change the firing of neurons.
[03:19:51.994 --> 03:20:01.679]  So now they can insert through the nanobots a virtual reality that is replacing your own thoughts.
[03:20:01.819 --> 03:20:12.181]   So literally you would be seeing something or living in a virtual reality that is artificial and you wouldn't be able to tell whether
[03:20:12.181 --> 03:20:15.581]  or not this is real or virtual.
[03:20:15.581 --> 03:20:21.461]   This initially augmented reality, then virtual reality is what they want to create.
[03:20:21.461 --> 03:20:25.621]  The other thing is this idea of bidirectionality.
[03:20:25.621 --> 03:20:29.181]  So these robots are biosensors.
[03:20:29.198 --> 03:20:41.148]  So they're sending all of our physiologic information, you know, from pH to blood sugar levels, to your heart rate, to what you're visualizing or seeing to the cloud.
[03:20:41.488 --> 03:20:55.043]   But then because these things are antennas, they can also receive information and they can change this internal milieu and change people from external frequencies.
[03:20:55.043 --> 03:21:01.763]   And so this is very, very important because everybody is just so looking at mRNA
[03:21:01.763 --> 03:21:03.323]  and spike proteins.
[03:21:03.323 --> 03:21:07.923]   We've discussed before that many researchers did not find mRNA in the shots,
[03:21:07.923 --> 03:21:09.923]  but they did find technology.
[03:21:09.923 --> 03:21:15.462]   And there are methods of modifying humans without genetic material.
[03:21:15.462 --> 03:21:21.203]   The other thing is that virus-like particles are nanotechnology.
[03:21:21.203 --> 03:21:28.543]   So all of the things that there are now weaponizing, they basically took a sequence and made it pathogenic.
[03:21:28.543 --> 03:21:35.263]   But when they are then implementing it through these nanomolecules,
[03:21:35.263 --> 03:21:37.903]  it can self-assemble and it can be...
[03:21:37.942 --> 03:21:39.963]  Frequency activated at any point.
[03:21:40.244 --> 03:21:51.231]  So, we don't know whether or not the nanorobots that we already have in our body, if they send a frequency, whether or not they can cause any disease they want, like Ebola, like Marburg, etc.
[03:21:52.732 --> 03:22:11.061]   Well, I will say Attorney Todd Callender and his researcher Lisa McGee did find, through the Department of Energy, all of these electronic codes that can be programmed, even activated, with AI at any time.
[03:22:11.061 --> 03:22:15.662]   And I will say again that Ido Bachelet of Bar-Ilan University in Israel, who partnered
[03:22:15.662 --> 03:22:22.682]   with Pfizer in 2015, confirms this capability, that they can pre-program the robots to do
[03:22:22.682 --> 03:22:28.302]   things at whatever time, or they can do it in real time, to release payloads.
[03:22:28.298 --> 03:22:48.684]  Now, he was talking from the perspective of, say, curing cancer and attacking the bad cells, but do we really think that those who are trying to depopulate us, and Pfizer, who played a huge role in that, hiding the fact that people were being killed through these injections, would not actually release toxic payloads into the human being?
[03:22:49.324 --> 03:23:06.951]  On that topic, Dr Mahecha, if we have a myriad of different codes, according to the Department of Energy, of real-time activation of these toxic payloads inside of people, is it too far of a stretch to say, and I've said this, that they're not going to get away with another invisible pandemic.
[03:23:07.231 --> 03:23:25.249]   The next time when you see people bleeding from the eyes, nose, mouth and ears, That is going to be an activation of the nanotech inside of people causing hemorrhagic fevers, which by the way, when you look at the list on the WHO of all of the potential pandemics, most of them are hemorrhagic in nature.
[03:23:27.293 --> 03:23:28.334]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:23:28.374 --> 03:23:34.017]  And then, you know, we can't forget the EMF aspect of this, you know, the activation of the 5G grid.
[03:23:34.698 --> 03:23:43.644]  So 5G is literally a quadrillion times higher EMF radiation exposure than would be normal to a human being.
[03:23:43.964 --> 03:23:47.466]  So that in itself will cause problems.
[03:23:47.906 --> 03:23:56.592]  And if on these frequency waves other information, for example, like of pathogenic activation is being implemented, absolutely.
[03:23:56.977 --> 03:23:59.339]  And then you mentioned something about artificial intelligence.
[03:23:59.379 --> 03:24:13.448]  So we have to also remember that now they fuse artificial intelligence with quantum computing and that all militarized weapons systems are now controlled by and automated by our AI.
[03:24:13.809 --> 03:24:21.334]  So what if this weaponization against the population is also AI controlled?
[03:24:21.374 --> 03:24:28.178]   Because we know that The singularity has been declared by the Silicon Valley.
[03:24:28.218 --> 03:24:29.338]  We're already in it.
[03:24:29.419 --> 03:24:30.319]  And what is that?
[03:24:30.479 --> 03:24:36.282]  That means that artificial intelligence is more intelligent than all human brains combined.
[03:24:36.963 --> 03:24:47.441]   And that has been even by Elon Musk, you know, warned against because AI then can decide that humans are no longer necessary.
[03:24:47.801 --> 03:24:52.484]  So who's in charge of these nanorobotic controls and the metaverse?
[03:24:52.524 --> 03:24:54.585]  Well, artificial intelligence is.
[03:24:54.725 --> 03:24:58.387]  And if that isn't a threat, then I don't know what is.
[03:24:59.948 --> 03:25:03.330]  Dr. Anna, I want to take a moment here because you're so spot on.
[03:25:03.830 --> 03:25:08.273]  So this, I've spoken about this book time and time again.
[03:25:08.313 --> 03:25:08.893]  Apologies.
[03:25:09.013 --> 03:25:10.394]  It's a black and white copy.
[03:25:10.414 --> 03:25:11.014]  The UN 100.
[03:25:12.794 --> 03:25:15.675]  Remaking the world towards an age of global enlightenment.
[03:25:15.755 --> 03:25:27.339]  In this book, which is the Boston Global Forum backed by the UN, they say that they are going to create a mixed reality that all human beings have now been entered into a new social contract.
[03:25:27.359 --> 03:25:32.221]  They call us AI world citizens and objects inside the AI world society.
[03:25:32.261 --> 03:25:33.882]  They don't consider us humans anymore.
[03:25:33.902 --> 03:25:35.162]  They consider us objects.
[03:25:35.769 --> 03:25:54.134]  And inside the AI world society, you don't have any rights, you are dictated to, and you need to be responsible inside this mixed reality that they're creating for you where you can't distinguish the difference between the real world and what sensations are being created for you.
[03:25:54.154 --> 03:25:55.515]  I'll elaborate on that briefly.
[03:25:55.875 --> 03:26:09.422]   In their own publications, and I've read so many papers to this effect, They talk about the fact that through nanotechnology in your body you will be able to see a hologram of your mum in your lounge room because you won't be able to visit your mum, that won't be allowed.
[03:26:09.782 --> 03:26:19.747]  You'll be able to hug your mum in your lounge room or hug a hologram of your mum and the nanotech will enable a real feeling as though you have hugged your mother.
[03:26:19.807 --> 03:26:24.852]   You will get That oxytocin, I think it is, release when you hug someone.
[03:26:24.872 --> 03:26:25.692]  You'll get that.
[03:26:25.873 --> 03:26:29.976]  You'll actually get that sensation, but you won't really be hugging your mother.
[03:26:30.317 --> 03:26:32.939]  This is what they are planning, published.
[03:26:33.099 --> 03:26:34.700]  This is their published plan.
[03:26:35.041 --> 03:26:50.314]   On top of that, I recently interviewed and spoke with an individual from Australia who is experiencing already This AI integration with a mixed reality into her real life experience.
[03:26:50.334 --> 03:26:52.236]  This is already happening to people.
[03:26:52.596 --> 03:26:58.821]  I don't know that it's on a huge scale yet, Dr. Mahajan, but I mean, you see patients.
[03:26:58.901 --> 03:27:01.043]  Are you hearing more and more of this happening?
[03:27:02.674 --> 03:27:05.377]  See, the problem is that it's so insidious.
[03:27:05.977 --> 03:27:17.307]  You know, you have heard about many people saying that the vaccinated are changing, that they cannot critically think, they cannot comprehend or compute certain information.
[03:27:17.368 --> 03:27:22.212]  Even if you show them the evidence, they are unable to actually understand it.
[03:27:22.773 --> 03:27:42.527]   And I believe that that is already a symptom of exactly that, that certain Information passages are blocked via digitized computerized mind control and EMF frequency and literally because they are able to do exactly that.
[03:27:42.547 --> 03:27:50.090]  They can monitor your brainwave externally and change the information content that you're processing.
[03:27:50.390 --> 03:27:59.183]   The other thing is that all smart devices like your cell phone Like other devices, they are all antennas and they are senders and receivers.
[03:27:59.223 --> 03:28:12.428]  So they're actually the first point that is transmitting your information to the cloud, but it can also send information and exactly like you said, monitor and modulate you through your eyes.
[03:28:12.509 --> 03:28:25.734]   For example, we are sitting in front of the computer and there are LiDAR cameras in infrared that can activate people's technology within their bodies.
[03:28:25.734 --> 03:28:30.733]   So I think that it's absolutely already happening because otherwise we would have a worldwide outrage.
[03:28:30.733 --> 03:28:36.293]   We have people being poisoned via geoengineering, their food being poisoned, their water being poisoned,
[03:28:36.293 --> 03:28:39.932]   their rights being taken away, and we don't have a world war uproar.
[03:28:39.932 --> 03:28:45.253]   If that isn't a sign and symptom of the fact that this technology is already in place,
[03:28:45.253 --> 03:28:46.413]  I don't know what is.
[03:28:46.413 --> 03:28:50.533]  Well, that's another really salient point, Dr. Mehecha.
[03:28:50.533 --> 03:28:56.253]   So the NOAA have, I've mentioned, I've brought up this example a few times
[03:28:56.253 --> 03:28:59.853]  because it's so important for people to understand.
[03:28:59.656 --> 03:29:12.820]  The NOAA, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration in the United States, has published on record, and you can view my report on this, the geoengineering contracts exposed.
[03:29:13.420 --> 03:29:18.902]  On their website, it's hard to find but it's there, on their website they have all of these different projects.
[03:29:19.306 --> 03:29:31.077]  In Utah, in Colorado, in Texas, all over the country, California, where they've been poisoning people through various methods of geoengineering, whether it be ground or air operations.
[03:29:31.438 --> 03:29:32.179]  Who's doing it?
[03:29:32.239 --> 03:29:35.642]  Their signatures, their names, absolutely everything is there.
[03:29:36.423 --> 03:29:41.748]  And I thought, this is just so bizarre that they would upload these crimes.
[03:29:42.364 --> 03:29:43.464]  On to their website.
[03:29:43.624 --> 03:29:44.765]  What is going on here?
[03:29:44.845 --> 03:29:56.687]  And then I found their 2025 Omics Strategy, which is a mandate on the NOAA to upload everything into the cloud so that they can then give AI control over geoengineering.
[03:29:57.248 --> 03:30:04.929]  And already they're talking now about giving AI control to see what geoengineering we need to do.
[03:30:04.989 --> 03:30:06.950]  These conversations are happening around the world.
[03:30:07.450 --> 03:30:19.715]  So when you feed the AI with the fact that, oh, we need to keep geoengineering because of climate change and the AI has been programmed for that, it's going to spit out, do more geoengineering, right?
[03:30:19.755 --> 03:30:22.036]  That's just, it's just math.
[03:30:22.822 --> 03:30:40.110]  And so if you have, if the NOAA has that and they plan to give AI control of the weather and geoengineering, what makes us think the pharmaceutical industry, or in this case the Department of Energy, that has this database of all these codes of activation of payloads inside of people?
[03:30:41.116 --> 03:30:42.617]  Electronic codes.
[03:30:43.037 --> 03:30:44.398]  Electronic payloads.
[03:30:44.438 --> 03:30:46.219]  Guys, these aren't real diseases.
[03:30:46.259 --> 03:30:50.941]  These are now, we're in the realm of programming electronically symptoms into people.
[03:30:50.981 --> 03:30:56.263]  What makes us think they don't have an AI that wants to depopulate the planet?
[03:30:56.624 --> 03:30:59.085]  That wants half a billion people on Earth?
[03:30:59.385 --> 03:31:03.267]  What makes us think that isn't already in existence, Dr. Mahajan?
[03:31:03.347 --> 03:31:05.588]  I'm convinced there is more to this.
[03:31:06.872 --> 03:31:07.393]  Absolutely.
[03:31:07.553 --> 03:31:23.565]   And we know from the geoengineering analysis that's been going on now for decades, we know about the Morgellons victims, but we know that, for example, methotrexate has been sprayed via geoengineering operations. Well that's a chemotherapeutic
[03:31:23.565 --> 03:31:26.365]  drug who makes a big pharma.
[03:31:26.365 --> 03:31:33.644]   The other thing for example, these polymers, these are plasmonic nanocrystals for DNA tags,
[03:31:33.644 --> 03:31:38.244]   that was all deployed via more gallons, which is what Clifford Carnican was talking about
[03:31:38.244 --> 03:31:39.604]  you know for decades.
[03:31:39.678 --> 03:31:41.899]  And he was seeing exactly the same thing.
[03:31:41.959 --> 03:31:43.800]  He called this cross-domain bacteria.
[03:31:44.181 --> 03:31:47.002]  But that is what I call a nanorobot.
[03:31:47.483 --> 03:31:58.029]  Basically an artificial construct that is attacking the blood and is creating these polymers that are coming out of people's skin and is in their bloodstream.
[03:31:58.489 --> 03:32:02.392]  So now we are at the end game of all of this.
[03:32:02.632 --> 03:32:05.493]  And we know that they have been spraying pathogens.
[03:32:05.534 --> 03:32:07.775]  They've been spraying toxic heavy metals.
[03:32:08.417 --> 03:32:12.159]  All of this in the name of the dimming of the sun.
[03:32:12.500 --> 03:32:13.660]  What total nonsense.
[03:32:13.700 --> 03:32:22.166]  First of all, they are the ones who are creating the climate change by poisoning the atmosphere and weather warfare operations.
[03:32:22.246 --> 03:32:23.667]  This is all man-made.
[03:32:24.427 --> 03:32:35.610]   But then the other thing is that we are inhaling these toxic chemicals and it's creating civilizations of disease and accelerated aging and it has
[03:32:35.610 --> 03:32:36.750]  done so for decades.
[03:32:36.750 --> 03:32:40.920]  The metals alone that I pull out of people is outrageous.
[03:32:40.920 --> 03:32:44.850]   They've even started spraying uranium because how would people just all
[03:32:44.850 --> 03:32:49.510]   of a sudden start having uranium coming out of their blood?
[03:32:49.510 --> 03:32:57.070]   Doctor, I have a quick question for you before we talk briefly on solutions because we're almost out of time today.
[03:32:55.297 --> 03:33:02.622]  You mentioned before about people not being able to sort of view information, absorb information.
[03:33:02.882 --> 03:33:13.969]  When you think of how, if the globalists view the human as a computer, and this really plays into the hive mind that they want to build, and they say they're building inside the AI world society, right?
[03:33:14.009 --> 03:33:17.772]  They say that you will have to think according to what they want you to think.
[03:33:18.332 --> 03:33:29.261]  And so if the human being is being treated as a computer that can be programmed, really that's not so far of a stretch considering that this nanotech can build new neural networks.
[03:33:29.942 --> 03:33:46.075]  And just like Google has been programmed, perfected to make sure that you can't find the truth on there, or it's very hard and you have to dig through the search engine to find the truth, this is how I'm viewing the phenomenon that's happening to the people that just simply can't wake up.
[03:33:46.115 --> 03:33:48.380]   This hive mind Is already occurring.
[03:33:49.062 --> 03:33:50.326]  Would you say it's similar to that?
[03:33:51.767 --> 03:34:06.779]  Absolutely, and the nanowire neuroconnectome, which shows that these nanowires, they are made from hydrogels that can interface electronically with our neurons and they can modulate the neuronal activity.
[03:34:07.159 --> 03:34:09.121]  Well, what is the translation of that?
[03:34:09.301 --> 03:34:10.082]  Mind control!
[03:34:10.722 --> 03:34:18.949]  If they can electrically make a neuron fire however they want to, that means that they can control the information that you're processing.
[03:34:19.420 --> 03:34:36.550]  And you and I have had conversations now for over two years about the fact, well, if you're no longer in charge of your thoughts, then literally they're also hacking your soul and your spirit because, you know, free will has gone out the window if everything that you're thinking can be remote controlled.
[03:34:37.050 --> 03:34:41.133]  So the dangers of this technology are phenomenal.
[03:34:41.573 --> 03:34:46.976]  And I believe that people really need to wake up as best as they can to this reality.
[03:34:47.276 --> 03:34:50.117]  A lot of people say, well, this is so scary, I don't want to hear about it.
[03:34:49.976 --> 03:34:58.536]   Well, you have to know about it so that you can do things to at least mitigate or reduce
[03:34:58.536 --> 03:35:00.296]  the amount of exposure.
[03:35:00.296 --> 03:35:03.176]  We'll talk briefly about mitigation.
[03:35:03.176 --> 03:35:07.535]  Dr. Mohaita, we've got just under two minutes left.
[03:35:07.586 --> 03:35:12.628]  So I've talked about, you know, being able to get out some of the building blocks, like the metals.
[03:35:12.708 --> 03:35:14.069]  I've used EDTA for this.
[03:35:14.149 --> 03:35:16.850]  Vitamin C, high-dose antioxidants.
[03:35:16.950 --> 03:35:28.294]  I've shown in another article that the lipid nanoparticles can cause cancer and that berberine, curcumin, and citrus pectin are able to inhibit the pathways of these galactins.
[03:35:28.314 --> 03:35:30.214]  You can find more about that on my sub stack.
[03:35:30.634 --> 03:35:34.916]  Other things, you know, get away from EMF radiation.
[03:35:35.336 --> 03:35:42.083]  Get out of the cities, drink clean water, grow your own food because they are absolutely poisoning all of the food supply.
[03:35:42.383 --> 03:35:51.493]  If you can think about that the geoengineering is spraying this stuff and our food supply is absorbing it because they're intentionally injecting it into animals.
[03:35:51.573 --> 03:35:58.420]  I've seen this by analyzing the meat and seeing that carnivore people, you know, their blood looks worse.
[03:35:58.880 --> 03:36:02.884]  So, doing all of these things as best as you can is very important.
[03:36:02.924 --> 03:36:10.791]  Your spiritual connection, connecting with nature, get away from your devices because these devices are programming you.
[03:36:10.811 --> 03:36:14.315]  You know, don't let your kids play video games all the time.
[03:36:14.335 --> 03:36:18.779]  It's changing their neurology and it's interacting with the stuff that's in their blood.
[03:36:20.219 --> 03:36:21.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:36:21.040 --> 03:36:28.028]  I mean, we hear about all the different ways that, you know, social media or gaming or our phones are affecting us.
[03:36:28.369 --> 03:36:33.915]  And very few of those people actually talk about the nanotech aspect or the gene editing aspect.
[03:36:33.955 --> 03:36:35.437]  And so this is absolutely vital.
[03:36:35.857 --> 03:36:45.720]  Dr Anna Mihaiča, you can find her on AnnaMihaičaMDPhD.substack.com or just search Anna Mihaiča Substack and you'll find her work.
[03:36:45.780 --> 03:36:47.261]  It's absolutely phenomenal.
[03:36:47.321 --> 03:36:54.063]  Support her and support InfoWars for continuing to bring this crucial, crucial information.
[03:36:54.123 --> 03:36:55.964]  Humanity, we've got to wake up to this.
[03:36:55.984 --> 03:36:58.805]  We've got to face the fact that they have done this to us.
[03:36:59.185 --> 03:37:01.928]  If we don't unmask, we're not going to find solutions.
[03:37:01.968 --> 03:37:06.133]  We can't just keep looking at the old approach anymore.
[03:37:06.433 --> 03:37:09.957]  We are facing a technological, biological weapon.
[03:37:10.317 --> 03:37:10.978]  God bless you all.
[03:37:10.998 --> 03:37:11.859]  I'll see you next week.
[03:37:12.540 --> 03:37:14.161]  Let's go to Nurse Keith in Oregon.
[03:37:14.181 --> 03:37:14.721]  You're on the air.
[03:37:14.741 --> 03:37:15.662]  Welcome and thanks for holding.
[03:37:16.002 --> 03:37:26.347]  About an hour ago, you were kind of explaining to people about how the micronutrients and stuff that are available and different foods actually have an effect on... Well, let's be clear.
[03:37:26.387 --> 03:37:28.869]  There isn't long-term billion-year evolution.
[03:37:29.229 --> 03:37:36.595]  Not trying to brag, but I'm a board-certified wound care associate, which is not an easy certification to get.
[03:37:36.675 --> 03:37:37.095]  It takes years.
[03:37:37.295 --> 03:37:43.295]   There is innovation and humans do get ancestral memories from their ancestors.
[03:37:43.295 --> 03:37:44.295]  That's called instincts.
[03:37:44.295 --> 03:37:45.295]  Yes.
[03:37:45.295 --> 03:37:50.935]   Not trying to brag, but I'm a board certified wound care associate, which is not an easy
[03:37:50.935 --> 03:37:51.935]  certification to get.
[03:37:51.935 --> 03:37:52.935]  It takes years.
[03:37:52.935 --> 03:37:53.935]   And it encompasses, you know, cardiology, endocrine, pulmonary, you name it.
[03:37:53.935 --> 03:38:00.935]  You've got to be good at all kinds of stuff.
[03:38:01.107 --> 03:38:04.889]  And let's face it, a lot of my doctors, they don't know anything about this stuff.
[03:38:04.949 --> 03:38:08.151]  It's my job as a nurse to figure it out.
[03:38:08.391 --> 03:38:12.393]  The average medical doctor gets two hours of college education on nutrition.
[03:38:12.733 --> 03:38:26.404]   So one of the things that I do is I'm looking for results and by using Very good nutraceuticals and supplements and things like that.
[03:38:26.924 --> 03:38:28.005]  I can fix a problem.
[03:38:28.185 --> 03:38:29.245]  Just a real quick example.
[03:38:29.285 --> 03:38:35.626]  Let's say you have a really bad wound on your leg and you have diabetes and poor circulation.
[03:38:35.706 --> 03:38:45.811]   Well, I can order you a bottle of Nitric Boost, a bottle of BezoBeat, and Hold on, hold on.
[03:38:45.831 --> 03:38:46.211]  This is important.
[03:38:46.231 --> 03:38:46.832]  This is important.
[03:38:46.852 --> 03:38:47.652]  Absolutely.
[03:38:47.632 --> 03:38:52.632]   But these things work better than any of the medication that we give.
[03:38:52.632 --> 03:38:57.632]   So I've got about 35,000 points because I give these things away as gifts.
[03:38:57.632 --> 03:38:58.632]  Hold on, hold on.
[03:38:58.632 --> 03:38:59.632]  This is important.
[03:38:59.632 --> 03:39:00.632]  This is important.
[03:39:00.632 --> 03:39:01.632]  Absolutely.
[03:39:01.632 --> 03:39:04.191]  Just iodine alone, it's essential.
[03:39:04.168 --> 03:39:04.949]  It means you die without it.
[03:39:04.989 --> 03:39:06.529]  They don't tell you most people are deficient.
[03:39:06.849 --> 03:39:08.930]  Two billion people have cognitive disabilities, the UN admits.
[03:39:09.170 --> 03:39:12.331]  That's what these concentrated plants and other compounds do.
[03:39:12.711 --> 03:39:16.933]  So you're saying you're taking care of people with wounds, one of the biggest medical industries out there.
[03:39:16.993 --> 03:39:17.813]  Super tough job.
[03:39:18.153 --> 03:39:23.615]  You're saying with nutrition, and also they need to not be sedentary, obviously, you're seeing massive effects.
[03:39:23.675 --> 03:39:24.996]  Because I've actually read about this.
[03:39:25.016 --> 03:39:28.017]  I'm not an expert like you, but that there's massive problems.
[03:39:28.717 --> 03:39:34.078]  Because the doctors don't even say exercise or get out of the bed or take supplements that are good for your skin.
[03:39:34.098 --> 03:39:35.479]  And it's so simple.
[03:39:35.559 --> 03:39:40.060]  I mean, my wife takes supplements to have good hair and good nails and it really works for her.
[03:39:40.160 --> 03:39:41.260]  I mean, this stuff works.
[03:39:41.340 --> 03:39:42.280]  It's the compounds.
[03:39:42.620 --> 03:39:44.041]  Tell people about some of the things you've witnessed.
[03:39:44.581 --> 03:39:50.802]  Alex, I would not have 35,000 patriot points if this stuff didn't work.
[03:39:51.062 --> 03:39:52.483]  I'm not into buying BS.
[03:39:52.743 --> 03:39:53.883]  I don't push BS.
[03:39:54.838 --> 03:40:06.205]   When I've got a complex wound and I see something that you guys sell that I know We can sell the stuff Walmart sells, synthetic stuff, and the bottle costs more than what they're selling.
[03:40:06.605 --> 03:40:10.887]  With us, these products, some of these products are costing us $30 a bottle, like DNA Force, okay?
[03:40:10.706 --> 03:40:15.266]   in the same game. The stuff that you guys sell is legit. We can sell the stuff Walmart sells,
[03:40:15.266 --> 03:40:20.305]   synthetic stuff, and the bottle costs more than what they're selling. With us, these products,
[03:40:20.305 --> 03:40:26.465]   some of these products are costing us $30 a bottle like DNA Force, okay? I mean, so there's
[03:40:26.465 --> 03:40:30.706]   cost because it is the highest rated. If you're taking a nitrate, like you were talking about the
[03:40:30.706 --> 03:40:36.306]  nitrate boost, well, that is going to vasodilate.
[03:40:36.535 --> 03:40:40.977]  So when you're vasodilated, yeah, you're going to be pitching a proper ten.
[03:40:41.317 --> 03:40:42.958]  The vasobeat does the exact same thing.
[03:40:43.378 --> 03:40:46.580]  But it also helps if I've got a person who's got really poor perfusion.
[03:40:47.478 --> 03:40:53.641]  And I just want to get their blood flow going so that I can keep this wound from going septic and actually get some granulation going.
[03:40:54.182 --> 03:40:56.163]  Or I could throw all the medications at it.
[03:40:56.463 --> 03:40:57.563]  Not gonna do a damn thing.
[03:40:57.924 --> 03:41:05.408]  The doctors see the patient for 10 minutes, write a prescription, say, okay, come back in 45 days, and it's my job to actually go figure it out.
[03:41:05.608 --> 03:41:08.149]  And so I use a lot of the stuff that you guys have.
[03:41:08.429 --> 03:41:10.310]  Thank you so much and God bless you, Nurse Keith.
[03:41:10.350 --> 03:41:10.890]  We'll talk to you soon.
[03:41:10.910 --> 03:41:11.491]  Give his name and number.
