[00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:09.746]  On January 16th of 1991, as the Soviet Union was collapsing and the Cold War coming to an end, George H.W.
[00:00:09.806 --> 00:00:16.812]  Bush publicly announced a new campaign of American dominance, which he called the New World Order.
[00:00:17.732 --> 00:00:19.754]  This is an historic moment.
[00:00:20.955 --> 00:00:28.301]  We have in this past year made great progress in ending the long era of conflict and Cold War.
[00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:37.012]  We have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future generations a new world order.
[00:00:37.792 --> 00:00:43.693]  A world where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle, governs the conduct of nations.
[00:00:44.994 --> 00:00:50.795]  When we are successful, and we will be, we have a real chance at this new world order.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.242]  Vladimir Putin told Oliver Stone that in the year 2000, he asked President Clinton if Russia could join NATO.
[00:01:08.846 --> 00:01:11.907]  Which he said made the American delegation very nervous.
[00:01:12.387 --> 00:01:14.447]  They were not interested in world peace.
[00:01:14.927 --> 00:01:16.228]  They had different plans.
[00:01:16.948 --> 00:01:26.030]  In 1997, the Project for the New American Century was founded by William Crystal and Victoria Newland's husband, Robert Kagan.
[00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:38.033]  In September of 2000, they published their agenda entitled Rebuilding America's Defenses, which outlined an ambitious and aggressive plan to achieve world dominance.
[00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:39.094]  We're good to go.
[00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:05.552]  A year after publishing this, 2,000 people were murdered in the World Trade Center and blamed on a small terrorist group created by the CIA.
[00:02:06.012 --> 00:02:12.173]  And with this catastrophic and catalyzing event, the plan for a new American century went into action.
[00:02:12.694 --> 00:02:20.975]  About 10 days after 9-11, I went through the Pentagon and one of the generals called me and he says, we've made the decision we're going to war with Iraq.
[00:02:21.575 --> 00:02:23.356]  This was on or about the 20th of September.
[00:02:24.426 --> 00:02:25.967]  I said, we're going to war with Iraq?
[00:02:26.047 --> 00:02:26.428]  Why?
[00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:29.770]  He said, I don't know.
[00:02:30.371 --> 00:02:32.732]  So I came back to see him a few weeks later.
[00:02:33.857 --> 00:02:35.958]  And by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan.
[00:02:35.998 --> 00:02:37.599]  I said, are we still going to war with Iraq?
[00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:39.020]  And he said, oh, it's worse than that.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.082]  He said, I just got this down from upstairs, meaning the Secretary of Defense's office today.
[00:02:43.103 --> 00:02:55.510]  And he said, this is a memo that describes how we're going to take out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and finishing off Iran.
[00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.401]  George H.W.
[00:02:57.441 --> 00:03:04.888]  Bush's son, George W., began a propaganda campaign to sell the American public on overthrowing Iraq.
[00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:07.390]  I take the threat very seriously.
[00:03:09.052 --> 00:03:16.539]  I take the fact that he develops weapons of mass destruction very seriously.
[00:03:18.081 --> 00:03:19.162]  Either you are with us,
[00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:21.859]  Or you were with the terrorists?
[00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:28.741]  When the lies became obvious, George W. made jokes while reveling in the blood of the innocent.
[00:03:29.262 --> 00:03:31.302]  Those weapons of mass destruction have got to be somewhere.
[00:03:35.724 --> 00:03:36.965]  Nope, no weapons over there.
[00:03:41.046 --> 00:03:47.209]  Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that murdering millions of Iraqi children was worth it.
[00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.110]  We have heard that a half a million children have died.
[00:03:51.047 --> 00:03:55.470]  I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima.
[00:03:56.211 --> 00:03:59.473]  And, you know, is the price worth it?
[00:04:00.193 --> 00:04:04.876]  I think this is a very hard choice, but the price, we think the price is worth it.
[00:04:05.277 --> 00:04:15.684]  The power-hungry cabal, made up of close-knit families who practice multi-generational child abuse and mass mind control, began overthrowing sovereign nations.
[00:04:16.024 --> 00:04:16.724]  We're good to go.
[00:04:16.744 --> 00:04:16.924]  I think?
[00:04:41.992 --> 00:04:46.618]  These inbred families are getting old and they are fighting for their lives.
[00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:51.765]  There is too much at stake for them to ever give up, which makes them more dangerous than ever.
[00:04:52.146 --> 00:04:55.710]  But they are few and we are many and they must be stopped.
[00:04:56.371 --> 00:04:58.835]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.

[00:06:11.428 --> 00:06:12.089]  Big Brother.
[00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:13.831]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:14.371 --> 00:06:15.492]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:16.293 --> 00:06:18.916]  You want to stop... Who does he?
[00:06:19.437 --> 00:06:24.142]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:32.113 --> 00:06:42.840]  If I were the prince of darkness, I'd want to engulf the whole world in darkness, and I'd have a third of its real estate and four-fifths of its population, but I wouldn't be happy until I had seized the ripest apple on the tree.
[00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:44.181]  The...
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.802]  So I've set about however necessary to take over the United States.
[00:06:48.882 --> 00:06:52.765]  President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[00:06:52.785 --> 00:06:54.046]  I'd separate the churches first.
[00:06:54.166 --> 00:06:55.967]  I'd begin with a campaign of whispers.
[00:06:56.287 --> 00:06:59.570]  With the wisdom of a serpent, I would whisper to you as I whispered to Eve.
[00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:00.650]  Do as you please.
[00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:03.252]  To the young, I would whisper that the Bible is a myth.
[00:07:03.693 --> 00:07:07.215]  I would convince them that man created God instead of the other way around.
[00:07:07.575 --> 00:07:11.078]  I would confide that what's bad is good and what's good is square.
[00:07:11.098 --> 00:07:13.860]  And the old, I would teach to pray after me.
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.121]  Our Father, Witch Art in Washington.
[00:07:18.001 --> 00:07:19.142]  And then I'd get organized.
[00:07:19.242 --> 00:07:25.224]  I'd educate authors in how to make lurid literature exciting so that anything else would appear dull and uninteresting.
[00:07:25.285 --> 00:07:28.386]  I'd threaten TV with dirtier movies and vice versa.
[00:07:28.706 --> 00:07:30.407]  I'd peddle narcotics to whom I could.
[00:07:30.447 --> 00:07:33.468]  I'd sell alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of distinction.
[00:07:33.768 --> 00:07:35.569]  I'd tranquilize the rest with pills.
[00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:47.908]  If I were the devil, I'd soon have families at war with themselves, churches at war with themselves, and nations at war with themselves, until each in its turn was consumed.
[00:07:47.928 --> 00:07:53.754]  And with promises of higher ratings, I'd have mesmerizing media fanning the flame.
[00:07:53.814 --> 00:07:56.456]  The president of the United States is racist.
[00:07:56.556 --> 00:08:02.221]  If I were the devil, I would encourage schools to refine young intellects, but neglect the discipline of emotions, gentlemen.
[00:08:02.341 --> 00:08:02.922]  Those run wild.
[00:08:03.502 --> 00:08:08.528]  Within a decade, I'd have prisons overflowing, I'd have judges promoting pornography.
[00:08:08.548 --> 00:08:13.554]  Soon I could evict God from the courthouse, then from the schoolhouse, and then from the houses of Congress.
[00:08:13.594 --> 00:08:17.658]  And in his own churches, I would substitute psychology for religion.
[00:08:19.671 --> 00:08:24.493]  I would lure priests and pastors into misusing boys and girls and church money.
[00:08:24.913 --> 00:08:32.296]  If I were the devil, I'd take from those who have and give to those who wanted until I had killed the incentive of the ambitious.
[00:08:33.937 --> 00:08:35.598]  I would caution against extremes.
[00:08:35.738 --> 00:08:36.718]  I'm here to warn people.
[00:08:36.758 --> 00:08:38.019]  You keep telling me to shut up.
[00:08:38.319 --> 00:08:39.199]  This isn't a game.
[00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:42.701]  In hard work, in patriotism, in moral conduct.
[00:08:43.437 --> 00:08:50.246]  I would convince the young that marriage is old-fashioned, that swinging is more fun, that what you see on TV is the way to be.
[00:08:50.946 --> 00:08:59.377]  And thus I could undress you in public, and I could lure you into bed with diseases for which there is no cure.
[00:08:59.437 --> 00:09:02.561]  In other words, if I were the devil, I'd just keep right on doing what he's doing.
[00:09:36.548 --> 00:09:37.949]  I'm watching the midterms.
[00:09:38.489 --> 00:09:41.870]  Then you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:46.032]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[00:09:50.013 --> 00:09:51.894]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[00:09:51.954 --> 00:09:52.735]  You want a Trump?
[00:09:52.775 --> 00:09:56.016]  You want a Trump?
[00:09:56.056 --> 00:09:56.436]  Damn!
[00:09:56.736 --> 00:09:58.857]  Who are the presidents?
[00:10:28.826 --> 00:10:31.888]  And you would think everybody in the country is just like, to the bunker.
[00:10:43.516 --> 00:10:44.638]  It's Wednesday, February 7, 2024.
[00:10:47.057 --> 00:10:48.118]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:10:48.839 --> 00:10:54.403]  We are 271 days, 12 hours, 49 minutes, 18 seconds off the most important election in world history.
[00:10:54.843 --> 00:10:57.806]  The globalists are hurtling us towards full World War III.
[00:10:58.647 --> 00:11:02.990]  They're now calling for Tucker Carlson to be sanctioned by the European Union.
[00:11:03.591 --> 00:11:05.472]  The neocons are calling for his arrest.
[00:11:05.512 --> 00:11:09.776]  This is all about the war on the press and the war on the people intensifying.
[00:11:10.656 --> 00:11:13.539]  The Republican traitors joined Democrats.
[00:11:14.571 --> 00:11:15.292]  We're good to go.
[00:11:41.308 --> 00:11:47.072]  We have leftists, and I'm not going to get into the details of it, filing constant fake police reports on me.
[00:11:48.533 --> 00:11:50.635]  And there's been all sorts of stuff that's going on.
[00:11:51.195 --> 00:11:59.481]  They've done things in a whole bunch of Texas counties, including Travis, where they hack into the database computers of...
[00:12:01.334 --> 00:12:08.095]  Courthouses and issue arrest warrants for me from other states to Texas.
[00:12:08.135 --> 00:12:12.676]  So the next level of swatting for child rape and stuff like that.
[00:12:14.457 --> 00:12:15.717]  That's the kind of stuff that goes on.
[00:12:15.737 --> 00:12:28.259]  I'm not going to get into all of it, but I was going to be hosting the fourth hour today, but I'm not going to do it now because I have the police coming here so that I can brief them so they can go arrest these people.
[00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:31.020]  Because they are absolutely sick of it.
[00:12:33.018 --> 00:12:35.959]  And it's not just one group, but it's a bunch of them.
[00:12:36.659 --> 00:12:39.200]  And so I don't tell you about this stuff.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.240]  I don't complain about it.
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.601]  It is nonstop.
[00:12:44.441 --> 00:12:46.922]  And I know the same kind of crap happens to Tucker.
[00:12:47.402 --> 00:12:48.823]  Can you imagine being Trump?
[00:12:48.903 --> 00:12:51.103]  I mean, it's 50 times that, 100 times.
[00:12:52.444 --> 00:12:54.244]  And the left brags, ah, ha, ha.
[00:12:54.744 --> 00:12:57.245]  You know, Trump's running out of war chest money.
[00:12:57.265 --> 00:13:00.286]  Yeah, he's real popular, but he's not raising any money.
[00:13:00.306 --> 00:13:00.806]  Ah, ha, ha.
[00:13:02.264 --> 00:13:06.566]  We've got the people starting to wake up, but we do not have the Black Rocks and the New World Order behind us.
[00:13:06.606 --> 00:13:07.847]  So we've got you behind us.
[00:13:07.887 --> 00:13:08.727]  We're in this together.
[00:13:08.767 --> 00:13:10.628]  But I need your prayer.
[00:13:10.648 --> 00:13:12.750]  Infowars needs your prayer.
[00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.831]  Because this country and the whole world needs your prayers.
[00:13:16.451 --> 00:13:21.054]  Because the globalists are moving on everybody this year.
[00:13:21.074 --> 00:13:23.095]  2024 is the big one.
[00:13:25.756 --> 00:13:30.559]  I mean, I literally couldn't get on the air at the start of the show because I'm talking to the police that are calling me.
[00:13:31.874 --> 00:13:32.114]  All right?
[00:13:32.314 --> 00:13:33.355]  And I'm not complaining.
[00:13:33.375 --> 00:13:34.937]  That's why I was going to come right off the start.
[00:13:34.977 --> 00:13:40.221]  I heard a few new reports that were powerful, and that famous Paul Harvey, if I was the devil, updated.
[00:13:41.982 --> 00:13:47.627]  But that's how they plan to just weigh us down with regulations and taxes and high energy costs and crime.
[00:13:48.007 --> 00:13:48.828]  I'm talking about all of us.
[00:13:50.189 --> 00:13:51.630]  They are at war with us.
[00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:52.671]  Do you understand that?
[00:13:53.271 --> 00:13:55.733]  We don't say the globalists are the enemy, just to use that word.
[00:13:55.773 --> 00:13:58.496]  We don't say the Democrats are literally an enemy force.
[00:14:00.637 --> 00:14:01.218]  It's true.
[00:14:02.401 --> 00:14:03.041]  We're good to go.
[00:14:03.081 --> 00:14:03.602]  We're good to go.
[00:14:27.353 --> 00:14:29.394]  I've been trying for two weeks and I'm behind.
[00:14:29.414 --> 00:14:36.898]  I'm going to start doing multiple ones a week just for the Crowder Show because I have this whole Satanism special that I've been working on for like a month.
[00:14:37.459 --> 00:14:38.719]  Didn't get it shot last week.
[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:39.940]  Tried to shoot it yesterday.
[00:14:40.601 --> 00:14:46.664]  Couldn't do that because six fake police reports filed yesterday.
[00:14:49.145 --> 00:14:55.289]  But now, one of the people doing it, their identity's known, so they're going to be getting...
[00:14:57.229 --> 00:14:58.611]  Visit, reportedly.
[00:14:59.711 --> 00:15:03.755]  But this is all next-level swatting, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:04.655 --> 00:15:05.896]  Next-level harassment.
[00:15:06.377 --> 00:15:07.097]  And I'm a big boy.
[00:15:07.137 --> 00:15:07.678]  I can take it.
[00:15:08.799 --> 00:15:11.301]  But that's how they take your time.
[00:15:11.321 --> 00:15:12.302]  That's how they take your energy.
[00:15:12.322 --> 00:15:17.466]  That's why you've got to stay focused on God and focused on justice and just know that God's going to carry us through this.
[00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:21.389]  But can you imagine if we just roll over to the New World Order how bad it's going to be?
[00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:26.213]  Can you imagine how...
[00:15:27.685 --> 00:15:28.706]  Insane it would be.
[00:15:28.726 --> 00:15:30.807]  Because I don't let the enemy take my time.
[00:15:31.748 --> 00:15:32.929]  Any more than I have to.
[00:15:33.549 --> 00:15:35.391]  So I haven't really told the crew about this stuff.
[00:15:36.111 --> 00:15:38.193]  I haven't even, you know, I don't even get into it.
[00:15:38.773 --> 00:15:39.494]  I just, they're insane.
[00:15:39.514 --> 00:15:40.675]  There's a lot of stuff going on.
[00:15:41.495 --> 00:15:45.178]  As I've got arrows and stuff shooting past.
[00:15:45.838 --> 00:15:47.960]  And God has put a defense shield up around us.
[00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.501]  But it's still not fun.
[00:15:50.882 --> 00:15:53.164]  So I'm going to do the show here.
[00:15:55.387 --> 00:15:58.248]  And I'm also massively prepared for the broadcast despite all that's going on.
[00:15:58.288 --> 00:15:59.069]  I was up at 4 a.m.
[00:15:59.089 --> 00:15:59.509]  this morning.
[00:16:00.429 --> 00:16:06.652]  And then it's a bunch of news I didn't get to yesterday that we're going to be covering and going over here today.
[00:16:06.752 --> 00:16:08.073]  So let me just do this.
[00:16:10.214 --> 00:16:15.316]  Let me tell you about what we're going to be hitting.
[00:16:15.356 --> 00:16:19.578]  We have the incredible border information, so many angles, so many fronts.
[00:16:20.038 --> 00:16:22.319]  Each one of these stories we can talk two hours about.
[00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:23.380]  I mean, it's just insane.
[00:16:24.574 --> 00:16:30.097]  House falls short of trying to impeach Mayorkas before Republicans join Democrats.
[00:16:31.799 --> 00:16:32.399]  Gaslighting.
[00:16:32.439 --> 00:16:35.581]  Biden claims the only reason border not secure is Donald Trump.
[00:16:36.061 --> 00:16:40.984]  We've got all the actual federal graphs and numbers we're going to be showing you.
[00:16:41.004 --> 00:16:41.625]  That's not true.
[00:16:41.645 --> 00:16:45.847]  The GOP had a good press conference, which we need to hear more of.
[00:16:45.887 --> 00:16:52.792]  They just said, we have a criminal government that are a bunch of criminal liars, and they're all frauds, and they all need to go to jail, and they're full of B.S.,
[00:16:53.877 --> 00:16:56.498]  And Mitch McConnell needs to step down.
[00:16:57.418 --> 00:16:58.759]  And that's what we need to see more of.
[00:16:58.779 --> 00:17:00.039]  So we're going to get to those video clips.
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:04.841]  World's wealthiest man using his own social media platform to expose Biden's border invasion.
[00:17:05.641 --> 00:17:06.402]  That's Elon Musk.
[00:17:07.062 --> 00:17:13.044]  We've got flashbacks of Newsom and Biden and others saying, oh, Trump wants to control the border.
[00:17:13.084 --> 00:17:13.724]  How dare him?
[00:17:14.584 --> 00:17:17.606]  A few years ago, and now here they are saying, oh, no, no, he broke the border.
[00:17:18.446 --> 00:17:20.267]  So we've got a lot on that front.
[00:17:20.667 --> 00:17:21.447]  That's only part of it.
[00:17:23.953 --> 00:17:24.713]  We have the big Tucker Carlson...
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:48.000]  Report.
[00:17:48.501 --> 00:17:53.785]  And they're dropping the interview tomorrow at 7 o'clock Central, 8 o'clock Eastern.
[00:17:54.585 --> 00:17:57.908]  Very smart to not sit on it and to get it out very, very quickly.
[00:17:57.928 --> 00:17:59.429]  It's very, very historic.
[00:18:00.109 --> 00:18:04.332]  We have the EU saying they want sanctions on him.
[00:18:04.372 --> 00:18:05.853]  Some are calling for Tucker's arrest.
[00:18:06.554 --> 00:18:08.135]  This just shows you what criminals they are.
[00:18:08.175 --> 00:18:13.058]  They don't want you to be able to hear what you want to be able to listen to as an adult.
[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:15.780]  When people censor...
[00:18:16.974 --> 00:18:17.434]  We're good to go.
[00:18:17.454 --> 00:18:18.055]  We're good to go.
[00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:53.412]  So I'm telling you, I have zero pride in knowing a bunch of famous Hollywood people.
[00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:54.633]  In fact, I'm ashamed of it pretty much.
[00:18:55.973 --> 00:19:03.436]  And I have no, nothing thrills me other than a sunset and hiking and fishing with my family.
[00:19:03.456 --> 00:19:06.998]  I mean, a lot of stuff thrills me, but nothing in the establishment thrills me.
[00:19:07.058 --> 00:19:11.139]  No status, no power, nothing but freedom matters to me.
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:12.820]  But I got to tell you,
[00:19:14.502 --> 00:19:15.243]  We're good to go.
[00:19:40.854 --> 00:19:41.294]  We're good to go.
[00:20:09.403 --> 00:20:15.208]  So, my wealth is my children and the future.
[00:20:15.928 --> 00:20:19.371]  And people like Tucker Carlson have the best chance of saving me and my children.
[00:20:19.592 --> 00:20:21.133]  So Tucker Carlson is mine.
[00:20:21.753 --> 00:20:22.774]  He belongs to me.
[00:20:22.794 --> 00:20:25.116]  And he belongs to you.
[00:20:25.416 --> 00:20:26.197]  And I belong to you.
[00:20:26.217 --> 00:20:27.158]  Do you understand that?
[00:20:28.839 --> 00:20:31.181]  These people hate us because they know we're good.
[00:20:31.702 --> 00:20:32.402]  We're decent.
[00:20:33.303 --> 00:20:36.646]  We're not perfect, but damn it, we're not out to hurt people and we believe in humanity.
[00:20:39.082 --> 00:20:40.984]  I've played this clip 15 times, probably.
[00:20:41.004 --> 00:20:55.341]  If I want to play it again, pull up There Will Be Blood, the clip where the oil man explains to his cousin, and he learns this is his cousin, kills him later, that he has a competition in him, and he doesn't like to see other people do well, including their families.
[00:20:56.206 --> 00:20:57.166]  We're good to go.
[00:21:20.828 --> 00:21:21.469]  We're good to go.
[00:21:34.278 --> 00:21:37.740]  Great looking husband, kids, wife come in, happy, well behaved.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:39.521]  They can be black, they can be brown, they can be white.
[00:21:40.102 --> 00:21:42.963]  You feel good seeing people successful.
[00:21:43.023 --> 00:21:49.407]  You see a great composer or a great singer or a great artist or a great football player and it makes you feel good about humanity.
[00:21:50.108 --> 00:21:55.211]  You need to get it into your head and it needs to burn in real good!
[00:21:56.095 --> 00:21:59.117]  That our enemy is a 180 degrees opposite of that.
[00:21:59.538 --> 00:22:03.981]  They cannot stand anybody having success but them.
[00:22:05.242 --> 00:22:06.423]  And that's why they're communists.
[00:22:06.643 --> 00:22:08.184]  They don't care about the average person.
[00:22:08.484 --> 00:22:09.865]  They don't care about the environment.
[00:22:11.086 --> 00:22:16.430]  So they pose as the environmentalists, and they pose as the communitarians, and, oh, they're going to love you.
[00:22:16.711 --> 00:22:22.235]  What they are is ravenous rats who even hate each other.
[00:22:24.087 --> 00:22:26.268]  They're disgusting in their hierarchy.
[00:22:27.288 --> 00:22:28.349]  And they will be defeated.
[00:22:29.369 --> 00:22:31.730]  At the end of the day, they're Satanists.
[00:22:32.151 --> 00:22:35.152]  Yeah, play the clip again, folks, because this illustrates it all.
[00:22:35.412 --> 00:22:38.113]  But just imagine this attitude turned up on 10.
[00:22:38.153 --> 00:22:39.074]  Go ahead and play it.
[00:22:41.655 --> 00:22:42.995]  I have a competition in me.
[00:22:45.116 --> 00:22:46.797]  I want no one else to succeed.
[00:22:52.579 --> 00:22:53.540]  I hate most people.
[00:22:54.983 --> 00:22:56.224]  That part of me is gone.
[00:22:58.365 --> 00:23:00.005]  Working and not succeeding.
[00:23:00.025 --> 00:23:09.630]  All my, uh... failures has left me and... I just don't care.
[00:23:11.851 --> 00:23:13.192]  What's in me is in you.
[00:23:16.053 --> 00:23:21.256]  There are times when I... I look at people and I see nothing worth liking.
[00:23:27.421 --> 00:23:31.163]  I want to earn enough money I can get away from everyone.
[00:23:36.446 --> 00:23:37.847]  What will you do about your boy?
[00:23:37.867 --> 00:23:47.492]  I don't know.
[00:23:49.893 --> 00:23:50.874]  Maybe it'll change.
[00:23:52.495 --> 00:23:53.856]  Has your sound come back to you?
[00:23:53.876 --> 00:23:54.376]  I don't know.
[00:23:55.231 --> 00:23:56.352]  Maybe no one knows that.
[00:23:56.993 --> 00:23:58.474]  Doctor might not know that.
[00:23:59.255 --> 00:24:00.096]  Where's his mother?
[00:24:07.122 --> 00:24:08.944]  I don't want to talk about those things.
[00:24:13.608 --> 00:24:15.310]  I see the worst in people, Henry.
[00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:20.835]  I don't need to look past seeing them to get all I need.
[00:24:24.022 --> 00:24:27.124]  I've built up my hatreds over the years, little by little.
[00:24:31.546 --> 00:24:33.687]  Having you here gives me a second breath.
[00:24:36.209 --> 00:24:38.230]  I can't keep doing this on my own.
[00:24:41.972 --> 00:24:42.392]  With these...
[00:24:51.803 --> 00:24:52.924]  They want us dead.
[00:24:53.684 --> 00:24:54.705]  That's not hyperbole.
[00:24:54.725 --> 00:24:55.385]  That's not hype.
[00:24:55.846 --> 00:24:56.526]  That's real.
[00:24:57.507 --> 00:24:59.448]  They want you dead.
[00:25:00.068 --> 00:25:00.469]  Dead.
[00:25:01.009 --> 00:25:01.409]  Dead.
[00:25:01.889 --> 00:25:02.150]  Dead.
[00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:09.795]  I have a stack of mainstream news and new major scientific studies that it's over 20 million dead from the shots.
[00:25:10.335 --> 00:25:13.097]  And cancer is the highest ever recorded shooting straight up.
[00:25:13.939 --> 00:25:18.303]  And they're saying, oh, the young people, they're all having heart attacks, and they're all getting cancer now, and we don't know what's happening.
[00:25:18.463 --> 00:25:21.806]  And they've got billboards and TV shows and public service announcements about it.
[00:25:21.826 --> 00:25:24.709]  They're murdering us!
[00:25:27.432 --> 00:25:28.232]  And people tune in.
[00:25:28.453 --> 00:25:31.936]  Glenn Beck years ago, he goes, I tune into that Alex Jones, and he's scary.
[00:25:33.902 --> 00:25:35.042]  Buddy, I ain't scary.
[00:25:35.082 --> 00:25:37.643]  I'm just the light pointing at what's scary.
[00:25:38.443 --> 00:25:39.464]  I know this is real.
[00:25:39.704 --> 00:25:40.704]  Now it's out in the open.
[00:25:41.264 --> 00:25:43.285]  And that's the best part about this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:43.645 --> 00:25:46.806]  Nobody's going to be able to deny things anymore.
[00:25:47.607 --> 00:25:50.167]  Hell, how can you deny what's going on right now?
[00:25:50.187 --> 00:25:53.128]  All right, I got all this news to hit.
[00:25:55.249 --> 00:25:59.951]  I am beyond pissed off and almost didn't do the show today.
[00:26:00.591 --> 00:26:00.851]  I just...
[00:26:02.575 --> 00:26:04.556]  I don't want to start screaming and blowing up on air.
[00:26:05.436 --> 00:26:06.517]  It's not good for anybody.
[00:26:07.777 --> 00:26:08.857]  But I tell you what, man.
[00:26:11.718 --> 00:26:13.879]  I just felt like I could just unscrew these people's heads.
[00:26:13.919 --> 00:26:14.720]  I know I could, too.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.801]  And I built up my hatred for these people over the years.
[00:26:19.501 --> 00:26:20.082]  But you know what?
[00:26:20.182 --> 00:26:20.782]  That'll kill you.
[00:26:22.482 --> 00:26:24.083]  It certainly had an effect on me physically.
[00:26:24.143 --> 00:26:26.164]  So I've turned loose the hate.
[00:26:27.096 --> 00:26:29.237]  I do this because I love my family and I care about you.
[00:26:29.738 --> 00:26:33.320]  Because if you aren't doing well, my family's not going to be doing well.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:38.283]  These people don't understand that when they crap all over everything, that affects them.
[00:26:38.303 --> 00:26:45.568]  And that's why they're so unhappy is because they're projecting nothing but destruction on the rest of us.
[00:26:46.189 --> 00:26:55.895]  And we just have to admit what we're up against and admit that lying down and denying what's going on and sticking our heads in the sand is going to get us all killed.
[00:27:03.348 --> 00:27:03.828]  Oh, boy.
[00:27:05.249 --> 00:27:06.529]  You know, let's do something fun.
[00:27:13.812 --> 00:27:15.112]  Here, here.
[00:27:15.152 --> 00:27:21.234]  Let's set aside them trying to arrest Tucker Carlson for free speech.
[00:27:21.294 --> 00:27:22.815]  Let's just see what that means for everybody.
[00:27:24.335 --> 00:27:27.636]  Let's just set aside Mayorkas and all the child trafficking and all the evil.
[00:27:29.237 --> 00:27:29.617]  And you got...
[00:27:30.933 --> 00:27:37.495]  Steven Crowder breaking with his investigative unit, another big public school that knew of a leprous plan to kill everybody, so they suppressed it.
[00:27:39.615 --> 00:27:40.576]  They just broke that news.
[00:27:40.616 --> 00:27:41.296]  It's hitting the news.
[00:27:42.576 --> 00:27:46.937]  Student manifesto to carry out the next Columbine hidden from Wisconsin families.
[00:27:48.678 --> 00:27:49.118]  We've got a...
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.241]  Young adults are having heart attacks more often.
[00:27:53.281 --> 00:27:54.222]  What's causing it?
[00:27:54.262 --> 00:27:55.182]  No one knew.
[00:27:55.703 --> 00:27:59.405]  mRNA vaccine, 19 vaccines cause more death than they help.
[00:27:59.425 --> 00:28:00.385]  Of course they didn't help anybody.
[00:28:00.926 --> 00:28:02.026]  That's another lie right there.
[00:28:03.127 --> 00:28:05.689]  Inside Donald Trump's incredible cash crunch.
[00:28:05.709 --> 00:28:09.371]  2024 is the new 1984.
[00:28:10.071 --> 00:28:11.092]  Oh boy, is it?
[00:28:11.432 --> 00:28:12.112]  Big article there.
[00:28:12.132 --> 00:28:18.236]  Oh yeah, JPMorgan Chase plans massive branch network expansion while small banks implode.
[00:28:24.002 --> 00:28:26.143]  There's another big report out in public schools.
[00:28:26.283 --> 00:28:29.264]  Children are being given a secret social emotional learning score.
[00:28:32.506 --> 00:28:40.909]  But the big news is the Putin interview and everything that ties into Biden.
[00:28:40.929 --> 00:28:42.270]  I got another clip of Biden right here.
[00:28:43.502 --> 00:28:45.925]  I didn't see on the list, but I saw it in my stack I sent you, Biden.
[00:28:45.945 --> 00:28:48.088]  He says, we've got to send Ukraine a bunch of money.
[00:28:48.128 --> 00:28:52.834]  I'm wearing my Ukraine pin and my Ukraine tie because they're in a lot of trouble.
[00:28:53.075 --> 00:28:54.136]  I thought they were invincible.
[00:28:55.177 --> 00:28:56.579]  But I've got some funny stuff, too.
[00:28:56.599 --> 00:28:57.300]  We'll come right back.
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:57.661]  Stay with us.
[00:28:59.588 --> 00:29:02.149]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalist.
[00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:04.871]  And people can't identify who's a patron and who isn't.
[00:29:05.191 --> 00:29:08.333]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalist.
[00:29:08.393 --> 00:29:11.295]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.
[00:29:11.555 --> 00:29:22.141]  That's why I designed this amazing 1776 red, white, and blue Gadsden flag shirt so you can support the InfoWar and meet like-minded people everywhere when you wear it.
[00:29:22.261 --> 00:29:27.864]  When you wear these shirts, it creates an amazing amount of energy and it's quite the adventure.
[00:29:28.164 --> 00:29:38.230]  So get your 1776 shirt right now at Infowarsstore.com and get your Team Humanity Infowars Limited Edition shirt right now at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:43.871]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is antithetical, the complete opposite of what the globalists are pushing.
[00:29:44.131 --> 00:29:51.893]  So get both the Team Humanity and the 1776 Gadsden Snake shirts, limited edition, at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[00:29:52.293 --> 00:29:56.074]  Spread the word, meet like-minded people, and fund the 1776 revolution worldwide.
[00:29:59.792 --> 00:30:00.773]  29 years on air.
[00:30:01.093 --> 00:30:04.075]  All I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalists.
[00:30:04.795 --> 00:30:10.098]  And I've done the best job I can to tell the truth and the inaccurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[00:30:10.498 --> 00:30:13.040]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves.
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:17.863]  Unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people, we don't do that.
[00:30:18.323 --> 00:30:20.224]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[00:30:20.604 --> 00:30:22.605]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product.
[00:30:22.665 --> 00:30:23.246]  It's so powerful.
[00:30:24.166 --> 00:30:34.210]  This is the breakdown product after your cells process it of folic acid, methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:35.911]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[00:30:35.951 --> 00:30:36.811]  It's not a stimulant.
[00:30:37.051 --> 00:30:38.872]  It energizes your cells.
[00:30:39.432 --> 00:30:41.934]  And then everything else you take just supercharges it.
[00:30:41.974 --> 00:30:42.834]  It's so insane.
[00:30:43.154 --> 00:30:44.655]  It's foundational energy.
[00:30:45.136 --> 00:30:49.278]  The strongest formula out there at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:30:49.658 --> 00:30:52.520]  It doesn't just energize this operation against the tyrants.
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:53.721]  It energizes you.
[00:30:53.981 --> 00:30:55.402]  Get foundational energy now.
[00:30:59.688 --> 00:31:00.389]  We're good to go.
[00:31:27.047 --> 00:31:36.973]  Premium quality organic CBD, like Rebel Zen, has been shown to naturally reduce anxiety, relieve pain, and decrease inflammation.
[00:31:37.453 --> 00:31:45.057]  People have reported a reduction in symptoms of insomnia, arthritis, seizures, chronic pain, and epilepsy.
[00:31:45.557 --> 00:31:52.181]  Several studies have shown it helps to reduce cortisol, increase serotonin, and boost vitality.
[00:31:53.082 --> 00:31:54.106]  Order yours today
[00:31:59.329 --> 00:32:03.052]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[00:32:03.372 --> 00:32:06.535]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[00:32:06.935 --> 00:32:11.419]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[00:32:12.039 --> 00:32:14.161]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[00:32:14.482 --> 00:32:22.468]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's You Will Eat the Bugs.
[00:32:23.089 --> 00:32:24.410]  This is The Great Awakening.
[00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:25.551]  We're good to go.
[00:32:39.787 --> 00:32:40.367]  We're good to go.
[00:32:40.668 --> 00:32:41.488]  We're good to go.
[00:32:41.528 --> 00:32:42.569]  We're good to go.
[00:33:22.273 --> 00:33:26.219]  You are listening to an Infowars.com Frontline Report.
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.122]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:33.712 --> 00:33:36.715]  All right, I'm going to get into the latest developments with Tucker and why it's so important.
[00:33:36.735 --> 00:33:39.898]  The huge developments with the border on so many fronts.
[00:33:39.938 --> 00:33:41.520]  Biden lying at record levels.
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:42.100]  We have the proof.
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:47.406]  And then, of course, Mayorkas not getting impeached because traitorous Republicans voted with the Democrats.
[00:33:48.327 --> 00:33:49.228]  And so much more.
[00:33:49.248 --> 00:33:52.511]  A special guest in studio to cover the waterfront, Drew Hernandez, popping in later.
[00:33:52.851 --> 00:33:57.155]  He's got incredible footage all by himself on the Mexico-California border.
[00:33:58.342 --> 00:33:59.063]  We're good to go.
[00:33:59.083 --> 00:33:59.703]  We're good to go.
[00:34:19.628 --> 00:34:21.570]  In English, like, this is our country.
[00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:22.091]  F you.
[00:34:22.111 --> 00:34:22.771]  Screw America.
[00:34:22.811 --> 00:34:23.672]  We're taking you down.
[00:34:23.812 --> 00:34:25.234]  I mean, it is just wild stuff.
[00:34:25.794 --> 00:34:29.358]  And that's all posted up on RealAlexJones and Infowars.com as well.
[00:34:30.979 --> 00:34:33.001]  But I saw this a couple days ago.
[00:34:33.062 --> 00:34:34.543]  There was so much news, I didn't get to it.
[00:34:34.583 --> 00:34:40.869]  But, you know, it really is important because when I posted this on, or I linked to it on my ex-account,
[00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:43.071]  It already had like 15 million views.
[00:34:43.151 --> 00:34:44.551]  It got a couple more million views.
[00:34:45.532 --> 00:34:53.836]  And I noticed the left was in there defending it, saying you're bigoted, Mr. Jones, against women because you're making fun of this.
[00:34:54.696 --> 00:34:57.518]  Well, it'd be like saying a man can have a baby.
[00:35:00.599 --> 00:35:02.100]  It's just ridiculous.
[00:35:03.581 --> 00:35:07.603]  So footage from Dubai shows women from Chile's
[00:35:09.096 --> 00:35:23.449]  Highest tier police task force attempting to complete in the 2024 UAE SWAT Challenge where they embarrassingly struggled to complete the first obstacle alone and couldn't do it.
[00:35:25.591 --> 00:35:30.875]  Now, there are similar obstacle courses that, you know, you can go pay to go on.
[00:35:30.895 --> 00:35:35.940]  And I'm not in great shape myself, but I can complete these courses way better than these young women.
[00:35:37.068 --> 00:35:38.668]  Or I could certainly complete most of the course.
[00:35:39.749 --> 00:35:44.290]  I'd probably have broken ribs or something by the end of it, but that's because I'm out of shape.
[00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:47.970]  I mean, I can still hike 15 miles, 20 miles if I need to.
[00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:53.872]  I can still hike up a mountain, but I'm not certainly good at the type of stuff SWAT teams do.
[00:35:54.492 --> 00:36:02.434]  But watching the women compared to the men was like watching a BB gun versus a .50 caliber rifle.
[00:36:04.014 --> 00:36:04.154]  And
[00:36:06.161 --> 00:36:07.102]  We're good to go.
[00:36:07.122 --> 00:36:07.382]  I think?
[00:36:30.945 --> 00:36:33.766]  So that they don't go out and have a family and so that they'll be part of the system.
[00:36:34.247 --> 00:36:42.651]  And then it sabotages the human system and they can bring in AI and robots to replace the post-industrial collapsed human society.
[00:36:42.671 --> 00:36:43.571]  That's their official plan.
[00:36:43.591 --> 00:36:56.958]  So I'm going to roll you some of the footage here and it shows the women proudly charging out and then getting the first obstacle which one woman made it through.
[00:36:58.254 --> 00:37:02.697]  And it's like a Laurel and Hardy or Three Stooges episode.
[00:37:02.737 --> 00:37:04.618]  I mean, hell, just see it for yourself.
[00:37:05.098 --> 00:37:07.120]  For radio listeners, I'll give you a play-by-play.
[00:37:10.402 --> 00:37:10.802]  Vamos!
[00:37:16.225 --> 00:37:17.706]  Here come the women charging up.
[00:37:17.726 --> 00:37:20.568]  Five ladies teams involved.
[00:37:24.312 --> 00:37:26.054]  In the UE SWAT Challenge this year.
[00:37:26.474 --> 00:37:28.495]  And they grab the little trolley.
[00:37:28.676 --> 00:37:29.196]  Belarus.
[00:37:29.476 --> 00:37:30.077]  Zip lines.
[00:37:30.157 --> 00:37:30.757]  Thailand.
[00:37:31.158 --> 00:37:31.478]  Chile.
[00:37:33.119 --> 00:37:34.460]  Two teams from the Emirates.
[00:37:35.301 --> 00:37:36.382]  One of them makes it across.
[00:37:40.185 --> 00:37:41.486]  And the others fall in the water.
[00:37:43.527 --> 00:37:46.110]  The first one to get wet in the ice bath today.
[00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:47.791]  And this goes on and on.
[00:37:48.552 --> 00:37:48.672]  And...
[00:37:51.246 --> 00:37:54.269]  Well, they are stuck in the middle of that zip line.
[00:37:56.752 --> 00:37:58.614]  So the leader goes back to try to save them.
[00:37:59.374 --> 00:38:00.155]  And then she falls in.
[00:38:00.175 --> 00:38:04.059]  You have to go back to the beginning of the zip line and do it again.
[00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:10.686]  And currently, Chile have three team members stranded.
[00:38:10.706 --> 00:38:13.509]  They don't even know how to rock their body and move forward with their hands.
[00:38:13.609 --> 00:38:14.490]  Of that ice bath.
[00:38:17.076 --> 00:38:21.118]  Thankfully, the water will be a little bit warmer than it was on the run this morning.
[00:38:21.338 --> 00:38:22.699]  I did this a few years ago with my kids.
[00:38:22.719 --> 00:38:23.519]  Vamos, vamos!
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:24.720]  My fat ass can do this.
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:30.523]  I was sore the next day.
[00:38:30.543 --> 00:38:33.785]  It just goes to show you how important momentum is.
[00:38:33.805 --> 00:38:34.846]  Oh!
[00:38:34.906 --> 00:38:38.688]  Three team members in the drink.
[00:38:38.708 --> 00:38:39.048]  So, well...
[00:38:47.512 --> 00:38:48.672]  And then all of them in the drink.
[00:38:49.533 --> 00:38:51.013]  It's all going horribly wrong.
[00:38:51.033 --> 00:38:56.895]  She's got some nice childbearing hips, though.
[00:38:57.775 --> 00:39:14.020]  The violations, the major safety violations for dropping weapons in the water are... And they try again.
[00:39:20.106 --> 00:39:22.107]  We need to play Benny Hill music in the background of this.
[00:39:22.127 --> 00:39:24.809]  We'll have to retrieve those weapons from the ice bath.
[00:39:27.651 --> 00:39:32.014]  Yeah, they don't even... I guess can't swim, so they don't know how to go down five feet and get their guns.
[00:39:32.034 --> 00:39:45.403]  I said on a couple of occasions today that if that first member does not get across the ice bath and carry that momentum, it forces those behind to stall.
[00:39:46.229 --> 00:39:47.730]  And that's when the problems begin.
[00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:49.431]  And we saw that, didn't we?
[00:39:49.871 --> 00:39:51.892]  It almost happened a little bit earlier on.
[00:39:53.673 --> 00:39:55.954]  We see this all the time in video.
[00:39:56.014 --> 00:39:57.675]  Talking to the judges at the moment.
[00:39:57.875 --> 00:40:00.576]  Female cop trying to overpower a big man.
[00:40:00.716 --> 00:40:01.336]  It's a joke.
[00:40:02.617 --> 00:40:09.560]  I mean, until just 20 years ago, if you weren't really strong and a big man and weren't tough, they wouldn't even take you as a man.
[00:40:10.301 --> 00:40:11.061]  All of the equipment.
[00:40:12.182 --> 00:40:14.663]  Oh, and of course, the added problem.
[00:40:15.811 --> 00:40:22.354]  It comes with those loops on the zip line.
[00:40:22.374 --> 00:40:23.075]  They become wet.
[00:40:23.135 --> 00:40:24.175]  Hands become wet.
[00:40:24.315 --> 00:40:25.596]  Everything becomes slippy.
[00:40:28.798 --> 00:40:31.559]  They can't even get to the bottom and get their guns properly.
[00:40:31.659 --> 00:40:34.041]  It's 1.2 meters deep, that pool.
[00:40:34.101 --> 00:40:37.022]  And as you can see... It's only been five feet.
[00:40:37.042 --> 00:40:40.564]  It takes a little bit of effort to get out once you've gone in.
[00:40:40.864 --> 00:40:43.946]  Oh, you don't have the body strength to push yourself out of a pool?
[00:40:45.912 --> 00:41:00.225]  One quick-thinking member of the BRT team of Chile, realizing that it could take a while to retrieve all of those pieces of kit, is just going down under the water to... Well, look out, bad guy.
[00:41:00.265 --> 00:41:00.805]  She's coming.
[00:41:01.446 --> 00:41:02.467]  Oh, the disappointment.
[00:41:03.408 --> 00:41:04.609]  Nope, she's going to be out of the pool.
[00:41:05.389 --> 00:41:12.095]  Remember, it's not like you and I getting in the water there in our swimmers.
[00:41:13.362 --> 00:41:27.712]  These guys and girls here are carrying a lot of kits and equipment and it weighs you down as soon as you go in that water and it's even worse if you get wet.
[00:41:29.033 --> 00:41:32.916]  This is the third attempt on the first obstacle of Zipline.
[00:41:33.196 --> 00:41:34.077]  Well, they're not giving up.
[00:41:35.058 --> 00:41:35.838]  Well, good for them.
[00:41:36.959 --> 00:41:37.780]  They're not giving up.
[00:41:41.582 --> 00:41:41.883]  Vamos!
[00:41:43.616 --> 00:41:46.216]  They now say they're lowering the standards to be a pilot.
[00:41:46.317 --> 00:41:49.717]  And you can be mentally ill and fly a passenger plane.
[00:41:53.638 --> 00:41:57.118]  How about the women just identify that they won the games?
[00:41:57.498 --> 00:42:00.579]  Just say, we identify as the first place winners.
[00:42:00.599 --> 00:42:03.199]  Of course, if you watch the film of the men, we should probably pull that up.
[00:42:03.259 --> 00:42:03.800]  I saw some of it.
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:05.820]  They're just charging through it like it's nothing.
[00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:08.940]  But you want to see them fail some more?
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.081]  You want this to keep going on?
[00:42:10.901 --> 00:42:12.021]  Will they finally just give up?
[00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:17.611]  So that's the false reality they want us to sit here and believe in.
[00:42:18.412 --> 00:42:21.373]  It's not that women are inferior to the other side of the species.
[00:42:21.793 --> 00:42:23.374]  They're not designed for that.
[00:42:25.735 --> 00:42:30.097]  And are there women in a certain percentage point at the top that are incredible and can compete with some men?
[00:42:30.157 --> 00:42:30.417]  Yes.
[00:42:31.697 --> 00:42:35.259]  But that is a very, very small percentage of women, and they can't compete against the best men.
[00:42:36.099 --> 00:42:37.760]  They can just compete against mediocre men.
[00:42:38.797 --> 00:42:39.217]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:39.277 --> 00:42:39.858]  Stay with us.
[00:43:01.772 --> 00:43:03.013]  Gunther in Tennessee.
[00:43:03.053 --> 00:43:04.114]  Thanks for calling, Gunther.
[00:43:04.254 --> 00:43:04.615]  Hey, Alex.
[00:43:04.795 --> 00:43:05.556]  First time caller.
[00:43:05.636 --> 00:43:07.938]  Real quick, wanted to plug your foundational energy.
[00:43:08.038 --> 00:43:08.999]  Just started taking that.
[00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:13.984]  And, boy, three pills, recommended dose, I was bouncing off the walls.
[00:43:14.104 --> 00:43:19.709]  But I tell you, foundational is the right name for that product because I'll cut down to one.
[00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:24.594]  It's like you have a baseline of energy that you were missing before that you got back.
[00:43:24.714 --> 00:43:24.814]  So,
[00:43:24.974 --> 00:43:33.235]  Well, I'm glad you mentioned that because it's methylfolate, the breakdown of folic acid, and a lot of people, particularly Europeans, don't absorb all of the folic acid.
[00:43:33.476 --> 00:43:34.576]  So it's not a stimulant.
[00:43:34.796 --> 00:43:38.196]  It's a totally natural thing that boosts energy that's foundational.
[00:43:38.496 --> 00:43:41.057]  And was I lying to you or did it not work?
[00:43:41.737 --> 00:43:42.937]  No, it was top-notch.
[00:43:42.977 --> 00:43:46.598]  And I was actually taking Red Pill Plus before, and that's got a little folic acid in it.
[00:43:46.658 --> 00:43:50.439]  I think there was a little buildup from this, but the energy from this was no jitters.
[00:43:50.639 --> 00:43:51.579]  I mean, it's top-notch.
[00:43:51.639 --> 00:43:52.359]  It's a great product.
[00:43:52.776 --> 00:43:53.739]  Well, thank you so much.
[00:43:53.779 --> 00:43:57.550]  Yeah, no, folic acid's great and it's in real red pill, but some can't break it down.
[00:43:57.590 --> 00:43:58.593]  This is the breakdown of it.
[00:43:58.673 --> 00:43:59.355]  That's exactly it.
[00:44:00.074 --> 00:44:04.177]  InfoWarsStore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.
[00:44:04.778 --> 00:44:06.739]  We want to have all the best brands for you.

[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:11.022]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[00:44:11.262 --> 00:44:11.983]  Hey, what's better?
[00:44:12.083 --> 00:44:12.583]  Knockout?
[00:44:12.944 --> 00:44:13.524]  What's better?
[00:44:14.285 --> 00:44:14.745]  Down and out?
[00:44:15.025 --> 00:44:15.485]  What's better?
[00:44:15.545 --> 00:44:17.147]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[00:44:17.827 --> 00:44:22.751]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[00:44:23.439 --> 00:44:27.023]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[00:44:27.404 --> 00:44:28.725]  That's how our bodies work.
[00:44:28.745 --> 00:44:29.666]  They're all very diverse.
[00:44:30.047 --> 00:44:40.238]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night Sleep.

[00:45:10.108 --> 00:45:14.772]  One of the most powerful ingredients in the real red pill plus is pregnenolone.
[00:45:15.012 --> 00:45:22.940]  Pregnenolone levels decrease with age, and low levels are associated with fatigue, low brain function, and unhealthy aging.
[00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:31.106]  The Real Red Pill Plus also provides essential trace minerals, such as vitamin B12, calcium, copper, and zinc.
[00:45:31.327 --> 00:45:44.317]  Featuring naturally occurring L-theanine, caffeine, and theobromine, the energy blend inside the Real Red Pill Plus provides an extra pick-me-up for your day that goes beyond the second cup of coffee.

[00:46:00.034 --> 00:46:02.317]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[00:46:02.477 --> 00:46:02.817]  Thank you.
[00:46:03.018 --> 00:46:05.581]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[00:46:05.641 --> 00:46:06.902]  I started taking that stuff.
[00:46:06.942 --> 00:46:10.146]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[00:46:10.246 --> 00:46:11.167]  When did you start taking it?
[00:46:11.428 --> 00:46:15.372]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[00:46:15.553 --> 00:46:15.773]  Mm-hmm.
[00:46:16.033 --> 00:46:18.735]  And I started eating a little better, but my blood pressure stayed high.
[00:46:18.755 --> 00:46:26.280]  And when I took the X2 iodine after about two or four weeks, I think my body was detoxified of a bunch of metals and stuff that my body was storing.
[00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:28.602]  And my blood pressure came down to the perfect level.
[00:46:28.982 --> 00:46:31.924]  And I tell people the only thing I did was X2 iodine.
[00:46:32.364 --> 00:46:46.253]  And even though I do think all your other products are good, I recommend to anybody that they start with X2 iodine because it detoxifies your body and kind of kicks your natural DNA into full force.
[00:46:46.333 --> 00:46:49.815]  So in my life, I found X2 iodine the best.
[00:46:50.276 --> 00:46:53.718]  I tried other iodines and they didn't have the same effect.
[00:46:54.018 --> 00:46:56.320]  So X2 iodine, I really wanted to point that out.
[00:47:01.437 --> 00:47:07.380]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:12.062 --> 00:47:13.043]  Alex Jones
[00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:26.851]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, this just broke at InfoWars.com.
[00:47:26.891 --> 00:47:29.952]  I was asking yesterday on air how long it would take for this to happen.
[00:47:29.992 --> 00:47:40.775]  You know, people like Jack Posobiec openly got threatened with people, including that tranny U.S.
[00:47:40.855 --> 00:47:49.438]  man who is now the spokesperson for Ukraine who got relieved from his command, her command, when he was saying, we're going to pay you a visit.
[00:47:50.598 --> 00:47:52.178]  And we're coming for you, Jack Posobiec.
[00:47:52.758 --> 00:47:57.979]  And you know, they've killed a lot of journalists, including one just recently.
[00:47:58.959 --> 00:48:00.640]  They tortured to death in prison.
[00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:03.440]  Gonzalo Lira.
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:09.701]  So now they are threatening the Gonzalo Lira treatment.
[00:48:09.961 --> 00:48:11.482]  This is on Infowars.com.
[00:48:12.762 --> 00:48:13.302]  Just broke.
[00:48:14.362 --> 00:48:18.603]  Tucker Carlson now on Ukraine's kill list for interviewing Putin.
[00:48:19.563 --> 00:48:19.803]  Europe's
[00:48:21.368 --> 00:48:29.734]  European ally that Joe Biden has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to is openly targeting the lives of American citizens for simply asking questions.
[00:48:30.735 --> 00:48:32.356]  Well, yeah, that's what the Democrats want to do here.
[00:48:33.037 --> 00:48:40.582]  Tucker Carlson is now included on Ukraine's kill list in response to interviewing Russian President Vladimir Putin that airs tomorrow night at 7 o'clock Central.
[00:48:41.483 --> 00:48:43.264]  And by the way, I'm just going to announce this now.
[00:48:44.285 --> 00:48:47.588]  I'm doing a special emergency broadcast.
[00:48:47.608 --> 00:48:48.989]  Tucker wants this free into the world.
[00:48:50.106 --> 00:49:01.729]  So as soon as the interview goes live tomorrow night at 7 Central, 8 Eastern, we will air the interview and then we will have commentary after.
[00:49:02.709 --> 00:49:12.531]  So I'll go live at 6.30 tomorrow night right after the war room and then I will give some commentary.
[00:49:12.771 --> 00:49:14.431]  I will stream it out on our network and our system.
[00:49:14.471 --> 00:49:16.552]  We will air the Putin interview.
[00:49:18.899 --> 00:49:19.319]  We're good to go.
[00:49:19.339 --> 00:49:19.759]  We're good to go.
[00:49:38.749 --> 00:49:39.870]  We're good to go.
[00:50:04.693 --> 00:50:13.062]  One extraordinary thing is that many American citizens, including ex-military and intelligence operatives, are included as well as a significant number of citizens of NATO member countries.
[00:50:13.442 --> 00:50:20.109]  Perhaps the most remarkable element of the NATO has hosted the site and a collection of affiliated websites on its servers in Brussels.
[00:50:23.032 --> 00:50:24.814]  So what they do over there, they want to do here.
[00:50:24.834 --> 00:50:26.876]  They don't want to just stop at censorship.
[00:50:28.339 --> 00:50:30.040]  We're good to go.
[00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:30.741]  We're good to go.
[00:50:57.918 --> 00:51:04.300]  The European Union is also melting down, threatening to impose sanctions on Tucker, which would bar him from visiting the continent or more.
[00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:10.001]  Putin is a war criminal, and the EU sanctions all who assist him in that effort.
[00:51:10.401 --> 00:51:17.903]  It seems logical for the External Action Service to examine his case as well, said Belgian Prime Minister.
[00:51:17.923 --> 00:51:19.603]  And it goes on from there.
[00:51:21.824 --> 00:51:22.424]  Big article.
[00:51:22.444 --> 00:51:23.764]  I only read the first two pages.
[00:51:23.784 --> 00:51:24.824]  It's like five pages long.
[00:51:25.264 --> 00:51:26.885]  It's on Infowars.com right now.
[00:51:27.853 --> 00:51:34.919]  We've just posted it on ex-formerly Twitter, so I hope you share that, and I hope you support Tucker Carlson.
[00:51:35.459 --> 00:51:40.643]  And as I said yesterday, right during this segment at the end of the first hour, he's risking his life.
[00:51:41.424 --> 00:51:43.486]  Make no mistake, this is serious business.
[00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:58.993]  Elon Musk has commented on members of the EU Parliament and the EU government saying they want him barred from Europe.
[00:52:00.014 --> 00:52:02.396]  Elon Musk said, if true, this would be disturbing indeed.
[00:52:02.476 --> 00:52:03.156]  It's now official.
[00:52:03.216 --> 00:52:03.637]  It is true.
[00:52:04.497 --> 00:52:12.003]  One may agree with Tucker or not, but he is a major American journalist and such an action would greatly offend the American people.
[00:52:15.445 --> 00:52:18.788]  Well, the interview airs tomorrow night, 1800 Washington time.
[00:52:22.685 --> 00:52:33.011]  We will be here covering it live at InfoWars.com forward slash show and on video and on our radio and TV stations across the country that pick up our transmissions.
[00:52:36.052 --> 00:52:37.513]  All right, here's what I want to do.
[00:52:39.474 --> 00:52:42.436]  I've got a couple clips here that I want to air.
[00:52:43.857 --> 00:52:47.419]  And I want to talk about what you can really expect in this Tucker interview that's got them going.
[00:52:48.675 --> 00:52:49.295]  So scared.
[00:52:49.355 --> 00:52:52.637]  So get the clip of Putin, please.
[00:52:54.558 --> 00:52:57.540]  A year and a half ago saying he's been warning the world about U.S.
[00:52:57.580 --> 00:53:00.342]  creating biological weapons in Ukraine and other areas.
[00:53:00.522 --> 00:53:02.883]  And, of course, that's come out that that is true.
[00:53:03.424 --> 00:53:15.931]  Victoria Nuland, who really is the president of the dictatorship there, her puppet is the penis piano player, Zelensky, and she came out
[00:53:17.276 --> 00:53:17.957]  Again, I'm just saying.
[00:53:17.977 --> 00:53:18.277]  Here's Putin.
[00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:43.334]  Ukraine, there was a network of dozens of laboratories led by and financially supported by Pentagon, and they were carrying out military biological programs.
[00:53:43.774 --> 00:53:55.559]  They were experimenting with the strains of coronavirus, anthrax, cholera, African pig plague, and other deathly lethal pathogens.
[00:53:56.299 --> 00:53:58.940]  And now they are trying to mop up
[00:54:00.191 --> 00:54:01.932]  The evidence of this program.
[00:54:01.972 --> 00:54:10.759]  But we have every reason to believe that next to Russia, in Ukraine, next to Russian borders, they were basically creating components for biological weapon.
[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:24.730]  And our numerous warns that such developments poses direct threat to the safety of Russia, they were rejected by Ukraine and by their patrons from the US.
[00:54:25.091 --> 00:54:27.893]  And they did it in a very brazen way.
[00:54:31.104 --> 00:54:32.245]  That's why they fear Putin.
[00:54:33.306 --> 00:54:36.188]  And Tucker told me it was an amazing interview over two hours.
[00:54:37.669 --> 00:54:40.712]  And that he's just super excited.
[00:54:46.857 --> 00:54:49.999]  But just pull back for a minute and let it sink in for a second.
[00:54:52.921 --> 00:54:54.463]  That we are so used to tyranny now.
[00:54:55.478 --> 00:55:06.206]  That where is the media, where are journalists standing up for their own profession, saying this is a long tradition, and this is a good thing he's done, regardless, we should hear from all sides.
[00:55:07.927 --> 00:55:11.710]  Remember Osama Bin Laden, 9-11, they played all the videos of him talking about why he did it.
[00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:14.151]  Of course, he was really CIA, putting out propaganda.
[00:55:14.171 --> 00:55:20.556]  It wasn't what really happened, if you know the whole story, but everybody goes to interview Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini.
[00:55:21.837 --> 00:55:23.338]  Hitler was interviewed during World War II.
[00:55:25.199 --> 00:55:28.561]  They'd show Hitler's speeches in newsreels at the movie theaters.
[00:55:28.761 --> 00:55:29.961]  People wanted to know what Americans were like.
[00:55:29.981 --> 00:55:30.822]  Here's what Hitler's saying.
[00:55:30.842 --> 00:55:33.283]  Because we were Americans.
[00:55:33.303 --> 00:55:34.863]  We got to hear what the other side was saying.
[00:55:35.744 --> 00:55:38.445]  When you're not allowed to hear what the other side's saying, you've got a big problem.
[00:55:38.725 --> 00:55:41.326]  And you can point at Russia and say they've got some controls and censorship too.
[00:55:41.626 --> 00:55:49.350]  But the West has far surpassed that now and can't point their finger at Russia and say, oh, look, you're the bad guys.
[00:55:50.830 --> 00:55:53.972]  Because who the Russians ban is foreign-funded groups.
[00:55:55.393 --> 00:56:01.338]  So the CIA turns around and says, well, we'll just ban all the groups in America that aren't for World War III, and we'll claim you all work for Russia.
[00:56:01.598 --> 00:56:02.319]  Just one problem.
[00:56:02.479 --> 00:56:02.879]  I don't.
[00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:04.561]  Tucker Carlson doesn't.
[00:56:05.862 --> 00:56:08.284]  Tucker Carlson wants all the big interviews.
[00:56:08.304 --> 00:56:11.646]  He's got Kevin Spacey.
[00:56:13.028 --> 00:56:14.509]  That's what Tucker Carlson does.
[00:56:14.529 --> 00:56:15.990]  He's got Alex Jones.
[00:56:16.811 --> 00:56:18.052]  Not supposed to interview Alex Jones?
[00:56:18.452 --> 00:56:19.293]  Interview Alex Jones.
[00:56:20.782 --> 00:56:21.622]  Interview Elon Musk.
[00:56:22.042 --> 00:56:23.723]  Interview interesting people.
[00:56:23.783 --> 00:56:27.324]  That's what he went to journalism school for, was to be an interviewer.
[00:56:28.224 --> 00:56:29.705]  That's what he wanted to be when he was a little boy.
[00:56:29.725 --> 00:56:34.866]  And now he's interviewing Vladimir Putin, and they're crapping all over themselves.
[00:56:34.886 --> 00:56:35.586]  I'm going to go to break.
[00:56:36.186 --> 00:56:38.467]  Bring in a special guest to talk about the border situation.
[00:56:41.328 --> 00:56:43.588]  What's happening with Russia and more.
[00:56:43.628 --> 00:56:45.009]  Please remember, we're Lister Supported.
[00:56:45.811 --> 00:56:46.191]  We're good to go.

[00:58:49.790 --> 00:58:55.233]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[00:58:55.993 --> 00:59:00.275]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[00:59:00.675 --> 00:59:05.057]  We finally have a limited run back in supply at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:59:06.478 --> 00:59:09.279]  So many people have serious issues.
[00:59:09.539 --> 00:59:10.660]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:16.522]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[00:59:17.062 --> 00:59:22.464]  Most of their iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[00:59:23.084 --> 00:59:25.985]  But this is pure atomic certified iodine.
[00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:31.742]  X2 is now back in stock, discounted.
[00:59:32.082 --> 00:59:35.264]  So I'm giving Thanksgiving right now for this product being here.
[00:59:35.604 --> 00:59:40.708]  It funds the InfoWar, but I guarantee you, you take this for a few weeks, you will feel the difference.
[00:59:40.868 --> 00:59:41.668]  It is amazing.
[00:59:41.988 --> 00:59:46.011]  It's the missing link, X2, back in stock at the end of 2023 at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:59:46.031 --> 00:59:46.051]  X2.
[00:59:51.491 --> 00:59:55.573]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:56.094 --> 00:59:57.414]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:02.017 --> 01:00:03.838]  Well, I don't know what will happen now.
[01:00:05.199 --> 01:00:07.180]  We've got some difficult days ahead.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:11.342]  But I'm not concerned about that now.
[01:00:11.522 --> 01:00:13.603]  I just want to do God's will.
[01:00:14.704 --> 01:00:17.886]  And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain.
[01:00:18.866 --> 01:00:19.947]  And I've looked over.
[01:00:24.409 --> 01:00:25.930]  We gotta come together.
[01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:32.074]  Whether you believe it or not, you gotta decide whether you have dominion over yourself.
[01:00:44.375 --> 01:00:57.505]  I believe that the majority of the plain people of the United States will, day in and day out, make fewer mistakes in governing themselves than any smaller class or body of men, no matter what they're training, will make in trying to govern.
[01:00:57.525 --> 01:01:07.333]  And you've got to decide whether it's God that's going to have dominion over you, that you get orders from, or whether some other human that's jacked into the evil force is going to have dominion over you.
[01:01:07.955 --> 01:01:18.669]  What we're talking about now is like a second industrial revolution, but the product this time will not be textiles or machines or vehicles or even weapons.
[01:01:18.989 --> 01:01:22.254]  The product this time will be humans themselves.
[01:01:22.274 --> 01:01:24.476]  Do we want to have a human plan or a post-human plan?
[01:01:25.077 --> 01:01:31.661]  Noval Harari and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates say humans are obsolete, we're scum, because they know we are their competition.
[01:01:31.982 --> 01:01:37.885]  They know that if we go for what we want and what God wants us to have, they can't compete with that transmission.
[01:01:38.246 --> 01:01:39.666]  They can't compete with that blueprint.
[01:01:39.907 --> 01:01:41.448]  They can't compete with that architecture.
[01:01:41.828 --> 01:01:44.189]  They can't compete with that master plan.
[01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:45.670]  But I just see it now.
[01:01:46.171 --> 01:01:47.271]  It'll be so clear soon.
[01:01:47.772 --> 01:01:49.553]  Are you pro-human or are you anti-human?
[01:01:49.913 --> 01:01:53.036]  You are the human resistance to this alien takeover.
[01:01:53.457 --> 01:02:00.744]  And again, when I say alien takeover, I don't mean some little tinfoil flying saucer crashing in Roswell from Alpha Centauri's.
[01:02:01.265 --> 01:02:11.074]  I'm talking about the transmission in the universe of God's order and God's will, or do you choose to serve the agents of death?
[01:02:11.949 --> 01:02:14.790]  And like Martin Luther King said, we're not going to judge them off what color they are.
[01:02:14.810 --> 01:02:19.951]  We're going to judge them off of the character of their actions and deeds.
[01:02:20.732 --> 01:02:22.572]  I'm going to say it right now, real clear.
[01:02:23.172 --> 01:02:26.453]  I love everybody, no matter what color your beautiful skin is.
[01:02:26.994 --> 01:02:29.494]  What I care about is your heart and your guts and your mind.
[01:02:29.995 --> 01:02:31.815]  And you're under attack by these Satanists.
[01:02:32.015 --> 01:02:33.175]  And they want to kill you!
[01:02:33.195 --> 01:02:34.896]  And they want to kill your children!
[01:02:35.296 --> 01:02:37.537]  And I say we set our differences aside.
[01:02:38.297 --> 01:02:47.759]  And I say we come together and we beat these people and we smash their technocracy and we build the future together and we can do anything with our real diversity.
[01:02:48.399 --> 01:02:50.380]  These enemies tell us all day about diversity.
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:54.021]  They mean divided and conquered groups of people separate from each other.
[01:02:54.041 --> 01:02:59.722]  This bill is supported by all of the Democrats, House and Senate.
[01:03:00.502 --> 01:03:02.483]  It's just a filibuster in a way.
[01:03:03.416 --> 01:03:17.890]  So, in a way, if you really, truly want to honor Dr. King, don't dishonor him by using a congressional custom as an excuse for protecting our democracy.
[01:03:17.950 --> 01:03:22.254]  If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.
[01:03:22.434 --> 01:03:24.136]  I want unity.
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:47.351]  Under a code of freedom and liberty and justice and coming together and working together and being strong and that's what InfoWars is and that's why the enemies of humanity hate us so much because we love God and God loves humanity and I am a human supremacist!
[01:03:48.051 --> 01:03:50.472]  I am a human supremacist!
[01:03:51.073 --> 01:03:53.174]  I am a human supremacist!
[01:03:53.194 --> 01:03:53.214]  I
[01:03:54.154 --> 01:03:55.796]  I am a human supremacist!
[01:03:56.337 --> 01:03:58.218]  I am a human supremacist!
[01:03:58.339 --> 01:04:03.303]  That term will be the future war with the robots and the AI.
[01:04:03.484 --> 01:04:08.068]  What you're hearing now is the entire future and everything they tried to stop us from doing.
[01:04:08.469 --> 01:04:10.971]  Our supremacy will not end with this planet.
[01:04:11.592 --> 01:04:13.313]  We will keep all the stars.
[01:04:13.494 --> 01:04:14.435]  We will colonize.
[01:04:14.615 --> 01:04:16.477]  We will green dead worlds.
[01:04:16.957 --> 01:04:18.279]  We will go interdimensional.
[01:04:18.479 --> 01:04:20.001]  We will unlock the secrets of the universe.
[01:04:20.281 --> 01:04:22.844]  God has laid them out like Christmas presents for his children.
[01:04:23.165 --> 01:04:33.798]  And I am extremely honored to be in the fulcrum and the heart of the fight to bring our race, the human race, in a race for the future.
[01:04:34.418 --> 01:04:35.539]  And we will break the enemy.
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.381]  We will break the pedophiles.
[01:04:37.661 --> 01:04:44.988]  We will break the Satanists because God already sent his own self down here to show us he could do it.
[01:04:45.588 --> 01:04:49.372]  God would never ask us to go through an obstacle course he wouldn't go through.
[01:04:49.672 --> 01:04:51.433]  And now we're going to go through what Christ did.
[01:04:51.533 --> 01:04:56.438]  And we're going to go through it and we're going to be destroyed but reborn on the other side.
[01:04:59.807 --> 01:05:03.311]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[01:05:03.691 --> 01:05:10.738]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[01:05:10.899 --> 01:05:12.901]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[01:05:13.101 --> 01:05:14.142]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[01:05:14.162 --> 01:05:14.883]  He loved the idea.
[01:05:15.203 --> 01:05:18.727]  What would you call the debate and discussions about a pro-human future?
[01:05:18.747 --> 01:05:19.628]  Just Team Humanity?
[01:05:19.688 --> 01:05:20.589]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[01:05:20.729 --> 01:05:21.170]  Absolutely.
[01:05:21.490 --> 01:05:22.892]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[01:05:22.952 --> 01:05:26.415]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[01:05:26.616 --> 01:05:34.064]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to give InfoWars on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[01:05:34.304 --> 01:05:46.055]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a revolution against the globalists and it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[01:05:46.335 --> 01:05:47.656]  We're told humans are the problem.
[01:05:47.676 --> 01:05:48.677]  We're told we're killing the Earth.
[01:05:48.957 --> 01:05:53.221]  We're told all this garbage so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[01:05:53.521 --> 01:05:54.222]  We're not going to do that.
[01:05:54.482 --> 01:05:59.126]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[01:06:13.059 --> 01:06:19.661]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:21.081 --> 01:06:29.664]  Well, she's a great talk show host and filmmaker, been a guest on my show many times years ago, and we've been working with her some now on...
[01:06:30.564 --> 01:06:32.286]  Documentaries and more.
[01:06:32.346 --> 01:06:33.447]  Very, very exciting lady.
[01:06:34.048 --> 01:06:36.350]  And she was coming into town to talk to us about filmmaking.
[01:06:36.370 --> 01:06:38.072]  And I said, why don't you just come on the show?
[01:06:38.813 --> 01:06:39.954]  And so she was here yesterday.
[01:06:39.974 --> 01:06:43.137]  But then I had an emergency come up and I had to leave in the fourth hour.
[01:06:43.197 --> 01:06:46.401]  So she stayed over, even though she was flying out last night to be with us.
[01:06:46.781 --> 01:06:50.685]  She's at LaurenWhiskeyDE on X as well.
[01:06:51.266 --> 01:06:52.908]  And it's great to be here with you.
[01:06:53.459 --> 01:06:54.559]  Thank you so much for having me.
[01:07:23.499 --> 01:07:24.340]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:28.124]  So, you know, remember when they kicked Tucker off of Fox News in the first place?
[01:07:28.584 --> 01:07:31.567]  It was because of his coverage of the Ukraine war.
[01:07:31.827 --> 01:07:33.008]  He was getting too close.
[01:07:33.709 --> 01:07:35.251]  And they spied on him.
[01:07:35.271 --> 01:07:42.337]  They ended up hacking into his phone, reading his text messages, reporting him.
[01:07:42.478 --> 01:07:45.761]  The one thing that they did not want to happen was this interview.
[01:07:46.281 --> 01:07:46.982]  And that's because...
[01:07:48.462 --> 01:07:50.003]  Putin knows where all the bodies are buried.
[01:07:50.043 --> 01:07:52.564]  He knows about the Ukraine bioweapons labs.
[01:07:52.644 --> 01:07:54.224]  He knows about the truth about the war.
[01:07:54.244 --> 01:08:05.868]  While Zelensky's been busy doing his rounds for Vogue magazine, begging for money, Putin has practiced extreme restraint during this war.
[01:08:05.968 --> 01:08:09.830]  And that's something that I think people are going to learn with this Tucker interview tonight.
[01:08:10.782 --> 01:08:11.522]  Very well said.
[01:08:11.562 --> 01:08:16.563]  Let's expand on your views on Putin and Ukraine and where all this is going.
[01:08:16.623 --> 01:08:19.364]  And him now, Tucker being put on the death list.
[01:08:19.424 --> 01:08:23.925]  And about six months ago, Jack Posobiec was put on it for criticizing Zelensky.
[01:08:24.645 --> 01:08:31.007]  And they openly had that man who claims he's a woman who was their main spokesperson say, we're coming for you.
[01:08:31.027 --> 01:08:32.687]  But it took a few months, but U.S.
[01:08:32.707 --> 01:08:33.607]  senators got involved.
[01:08:34.047 --> 01:08:35.448]  That individual got fired over this.
[01:08:36.028 --> 01:08:38.248]  So this is, I mean, even the Senate gets this big deal.
[01:08:38.629 --> 01:08:40.349]  Now they're threatening to kill Tucker Carlson.
[01:08:41.652 --> 01:08:49.077]  Yep, and they're talking about sanctioning him so he can't even come back into the country, sanctioning him in Europe.
[01:08:49.697 --> 01:08:52.419]  They are trying to do everything they can to prevent this from being aired.
[01:08:52.619 --> 01:08:53.539]  But you know what?
[01:08:53.659 --> 01:09:02.184]  Whether you like it or not, I'm told tomorrow at 6 p.m., they are going to be releasing the Putin interview, and it's going to change everything.
[01:09:02.565 --> 01:09:03.505]  What is 1800 Washington?
[01:09:03.565 --> 01:09:03.705]  What?
[01:09:07.739 --> 01:09:12.245]  Tomorrow evening, we'll get all that out, and we're going to be here covering it live.
[01:09:12.285 --> 01:09:18.393]  But, you know, sitting here looking at this, when I was being deplatformed and demonized everywhere, people said, how are you taking it?
[01:09:18.413 --> 01:09:21.937]  And I said, I know I'm just a beta test, because I've read the NATO plans.
[01:09:22.238 --> 01:09:24.220]  Funny enough, NATO was involved kind of hatching
[01:09:24.781 --> 01:09:25.201]  This is a beta test.
[01:09:53.035 --> 01:09:53.655]  Yes, yes.
[01:09:53.876 --> 01:09:57.638]  And what they're doing to him, you don't think that they're going to do to the rest of us.
[01:09:58.199 --> 01:10:03.583]  Now, Tucker, he ended up losing his job with Fox News because he was covering the war so fairly.
[01:10:04.103 --> 01:10:09.767]  And then you see the freak out when he goes to Russia and gets the interview himself.
[01:10:10.187 --> 01:10:13.350]  Because he is, you know, we get propaganda.
[01:10:13.390 --> 01:10:14.390]  We get propaganda here.
[01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:19.154]  We get whatever the regime, the military-industrial complex wants us to know.
[01:10:19.774 --> 01:10:23.316]  And it's a shame because we basically have government-ran media.
[01:10:23.636 --> 01:10:25.077]  We don't get to know the truth.
[01:10:25.137 --> 01:10:31.020]  But Tucker going directly to Putin, someone who empowered the church in his country.
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:35.702]  He brought the church up right next to him and empowered Christians in his country.
[01:10:36.042 --> 01:10:37.923]  And Zelensky's family Orthodox Church.
[01:10:38.103 --> 01:10:46.811]  Yes, and then Zelensky, on the other hand, is arresting Ukrainian Orthodox church members because they might have a connection to Russia.
[01:10:47.412 --> 01:10:58.782]  And it's kind of evident, it's very evident, while Zelensky has a transgender spokesperson lecturing us on the evils of Putin, Putin is calling out America for...
[01:11:02.037 --> 01:11:05.100]  Well, remember when he called us, I think, the Great Satan or something?
[01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:11.787]  Well, what he said was the American people have an elite bombarding them with anti-family evil.
[01:11:11.827 --> 01:11:12.048]  Yes.
[01:11:12.208 --> 01:11:13.229]  They're trying to destroy their family.
[01:11:13.469 --> 01:11:14.270]  Yes, yeah.
[01:11:14.290 --> 01:11:18.074]  He said basically that the United States is run by pedophiles, which is true.
[01:11:18.334 --> 01:11:19.154]  Yes, and it's true.
[01:11:19.234 --> 01:11:19.714]  They're watching.
[01:11:19.734 --> 01:11:23.595]  The world is watching as we are grooming little children, letting drag queens read to our kids.
[01:11:23.875 --> 01:11:27.156]  And it's embarrassing because we used to be a strong country.
[01:11:27.176 --> 01:11:29.297]  Other countries used to respect us.
[01:11:29.377 --> 01:11:32.657]  I mean, no matter what, you respect Russia and their power structure.
[01:11:34.218 --> 01:11:37.178]  Well, this is a lot bigger than Tucker, as I keep saying.
[01:11:37.198 --> 01:11:38.819]  It's a lens through which we see everything.
[01:11:39.721 --> 01:11:40.922]  We're good to go.
[01:11:52.532 --> 01:11:56.918]  It really shows how bad these people really are and what they would do to us if they could get away with it.
[01:11:57.238 --> 01:12:01.323]  I know I keep saying that, but they're not playing games here.
[01:12:01.804 --> 01:12:05.969]  Right, and we've seen a little bit about what they will do if they can get away with it.
[01:12:06.049 --> 01:12:09.774]  We still have Jay Sixers sitting in the gulag without due process.
[01:12:10.094 --> 01:12:11.415]  There are no rules anymore.
[01:12:11.895 --> 01:12:14.215]  It's just whatever they say goes.
[01:12:14.296 --> 01:12:16.836]  The laws of America don't matter anymore.
[01:12:16.936 --> 01:12:19.857]  It's whatever the regime chooses to do to you.
[01:12:20.018 --> 01:12:24.019]  And they get away with it, too, because what they did was they played the long game.
[01:12:24.059 --> 01:12:27.100]  They put their people in positions of power slowly.
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.220]  They were very patient.
[01:12:28.701 --> 01:12:31.562]  And in the courts, in the White House, in...
[01:12:33.222 --> 01:12:34.043]  The legislature.
[01:12:34.203 --> 01:12:39.206]  And then they put their people there and installed them so they can do whatever they want to us.
[01:12:39.226 --> 01:12:41.148]  And we weren't prepared for it, I don't think.
[01:12:41.508 --> 01:12:43.209]  But I don't think it's all hopeless.
[01:12:43.249 --> 01:12:49.073]  I think that if something happens to Tucker Carlson, it's going to spark a global outrage.
[01:12:49.974 --> 01:12:50.934]  Well, exactly.
[01:12:50.974 --> 01:12:51.975]  He's loved all over the world.
[01:12:52.875 --> 01:12:54.717]  And it shows how popular Liberty is.
[01:12:54.777 --> 01:13:00.400]  He tells me, other people tell me, I don't go to Europe a lot because I'm so busy, that people bring this show up a lot to them.
[01:13:00.541 --> 01:13:01.841]  And that's what the Tate brothers tell me.
[01:13:03.246 --> 01:13:03.767]  We're good to go.
[01:13:27.509 --> 01:13:28.170]  Let's be conservative.
[01:13:28.190 --> 01:13:29.331]  Ten million a day.
[01:13:56.312 --> 01:13:57.993]  Okay, well, CNN's top show has a million.
[01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:03.957]  So they act like because they're an old dinosaur and they're still on TV, oh, look, you're not on our thing.
[01:14:03.997 --> 01:14:07.039]  You're not in our... It's like you drive by a pigsty.
[01:14:07.059 --> 01:14:08.360]  They're like, you're not in our pigsty.
[01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:10.482]  You're not... It's a mind game.
[01:14:10.862 --> 01:14:14.945]  But no one's even buying it, I think, except the talking heads, or maybe they even know what a joke they are.
[01:14:15.245 --> 01:14:18.668]  No, I mean, digital media is next.
[01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:21.871]  The mainstream cable news, it's dying.
[01:14:22.051 --> 01:14:23.332]  And it's dying very quickly.
[01:14:23.492 --> 01:14:24.233]  And they know it.
[01:14:24.674 --> 01:14:28.337]  So they're freaking out because people are becoming their own journalists.
[01:14:28.697 --> 01:14:34.923]  We, the people, have become journalists because we can put out information, do our own investigations, and expose the truth.
[01:14:35.003 --> 01:14:36.944]  And they are terrified of that.
[01:14:37.285 --> 01:14:38.386]  And they're realizing that
[01:14:38.866 --> 01:14:45.392]  As people move over from network television, you know, Tucker was limited to, what was it, 4 million views a night?
[01:14:45.612 --> 01:14:45.792]  Yeah.
[01:14:45.893 --> 01:14:51.918]  That's limited, you know, because unless you have a subscription to Fox News or cable, you don't really get access to his information.
[01:14:52.418 --> 01:14:54.260]  Moving to... And nothing against old people.
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:55.641]  The average age is 75.
[01:14:56.322 --> 01:14:57.383]  Now he's reaching the young people.
[01:14:57.563 --> 01:14:57.743]  Yes.
[01:14:58.223 --> 01:15:00.885]  And that generation is kind of moving on.
[01:15:00.945 --> 01:15:03.686]  They're passing away, and it's going to be us next.
[01:15:03.746 --> 01:15:05.147]  And who's going to carry that torch?
[01:15:05.507 --> 01:15:16.133]  Well, it's got to be us younger folks who are making media outlets, are investigating, doing our own journalism, and anybody could get as many views as Tucker Carlson.
[01:15:16.193 --> 01:15:17.553]  And if we build it, they will come.
[01:15:17.573 --> 01:15:18.534]  And let's expand on that.
[01:15:19.932 --> 01:15:20.793]  We're good to go.
[01:15:20.813 --> 01:15:20.953]  I think?
[01:15:41.434 --> 01:15:41.554]  Right.
[01:15:41.574 --> 01:15:41.734]  Right.
[01:16:03.357 --> 01:16:07.399]  No, he absolutely is, and I hope many more people follow suit as well.
[01:16:08.259 --> 01:16:10.781]  Like I said, they're terrified because he's putting his stuff out there.
[01:16:10.801 --> 01:16:12.922]  It's accessible to everybody.
[01:16:13.002 --> 01:16:18.484]  So they're all wondering, what exactly did Tucker and Putin say to each other?
[01:16:18.544 --> 01:16:31.390]  Because they're already trying to paint this picture that it's a propaganda piece to build up Russia, and now Tucker's a traitor, and we're going to find out ourselves the truth because they're going to put it out there, and that's what scares them the most.
[01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:32.371]  Well, let me make a prediction.
[01:16:34.261 --> 01:16:34.641]  We're good to go.
[01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:54.210]  Exposing things.
[01:16:54.270 --> 01:16:56.071]  But now it's just going to be magnified.
[01:16:56.351 --> 01:16:59.051]  But what they really hate is they don't have the control.
[01:16:59.431 --> 01:17:07.913]  They fired him to try to make him go away, and now he's much bigger, just like InfoWars got bigger when they tried to shut us down.
[01:17:08.094 --> 01:17:08.774]  No, it's true.
[01:17:08.834 --> 01:17:10.914]  And, you know, it's great to see you back on Twitter.
[01:17:10.934 --> 01:17:11.634]  I follow your account.
[01:17:11.674 --> 01:17:13.115]  I think it's absolutely great.
[01:17:13.555 --> 01:17:14.835]  And it's... Typos and alls.
[01:17:14.915 --> 01:17:16.296]  It's me on there, folks.
[01:17:16.436 --> 01:17:16.936]  I love it.
[01:17:16.976 --> 01:17:17.456]  I love it.
[01:17:17.496 --> 01:17:20.997]  But, no, it's an expansion of our reach is what it is.
[01:17:21.037 --> 01:17:22.077]  And the fact that Elon Musk...
[01:17:22.597 --> 01:17:23.098]  We're good to go.
[01:17:44.798 --> 01:17:49.301]  The Department of Homeland Security is hunting down patriots who believe the election is stolen.
[01:17:49.341 --> 01:17:51.602]  They're putting them on domestic terrorist watch lists.
[01:17:51.842 --> 01:17:57.285]  They're trying to scare us into thinking that, oh, I better not speak up about this because that's all they have left.
[01:17:57.545 --> 01:17:59.526]  Because we are sharing the truth.
[01:17:59.566 --> 01:18:01.147]  We are getting information out there.
[01:18:01.467 --> 01:18:12.173]  And they'll continue to kind of pull in that stranglehold on patriots and dissidents and people who do real journalism in an attempt to try and stop us.
[01:18:12.474 --> 01:18:13.014]  But it won't work.
[01:18:13.294 --> 01:18:16.239]  By the way, I've got a clip of Putin two years ago.
[01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:18.363]  He's being interviewed by NBC News.
[01:18:18.503 --> 01:18:19.324]  We'll play this in a moment.
[01:18:21.621 --> 01:18:21.801]  Mm-hmm.
[01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:45.960]  I think.
[01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:46.120]  I think.
[01:19:11.552 --> 01:19:13.360]  Can I just ask you a direct question?
[01:19:13.461 --> 01:19:16.013]  Did you order Alexei Navalny's assassination?
[01:19:20.083 --> 01:19:20.804]  Of course not.
[01:19:20.824 --> 01:19:24.806]  We don't have this kind of habit of assassinating anybody.
[01:19:24.826 --> 01:19:25.386]  That's one.
[01:19:26.666 --> 01:19:34.951]  Number two is, I want to ask you, did you order the assassination of the woman who walked into the Congress and who was shot and killed by a policeman?
[01:19:34.971 --> 01:19:42.935]  Do you know that 450 individuals were arrested after entering the Congress and they didn't go there to steal a laptop?
[01:19:43.655 --> 01:19:45.196]  They came with political demands.
[01:19:46.777 --> 01:19:48.498]  450 people have been detained.
[01:19:48.518 --> 01:19:55.724]  You're talking about a capital... They're looking at jail time between 15 and 25 years.
[01:19:56.584 --> 01:19:59.247]  And they came to the Congress with political demands.
[01:20:00.067 --> 01:20:02.069]  Isn't that persecution for political opinions?
[01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:06.593]  And he said that two and a half years ago.
[01:20:06.613 --> 01:20:08.898]  Now it's like 1,400 people charged, 1,000.
[01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:13.327]  Some people get five-year jail terms for walking between velvet ropes.
[01:20:13.828 --> 01:20:15.372]  I mean, imagine if the Russians were doing that.
[01:20:15.412 --> 01:20:16.073]  We'd be like, whoa.
[01:20:16.536 --> 01:20:16.736]  Right.
[01:20:16.836 --> 01:20:22.059]  No, I didn't even go in the Capitol and they put me on the domestic terrorist watch list every time I went to go fly.
[01:20:22.079 --> 01:20:24.900]  I had to be escorted by Homeland Security.
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:27.181]  They had to swab my hands for explosives.
[01:20:27.461 --> 01:20:29.842]  And then I had to do it all over again at my connecting flights.
[01:20:29.862 --> 01:20:36.145]  They really tried to make us, like our lives, a living hell because they were scared of that uprising that happened on J6.
[01:20:36.185 --> 01:20:38.366]  They do not want the people to rebel.
[01:20:38.726 --> 01:20:40.728]  Well, they're lucky we didn't.
[01:20:40.768 --> 01:20:43.391]  They say that was our planned thing.
[01:20:43.752 --> 01:20:45.394]  No, that was them setting us up.
[01:20:45.774 --> 01:20:47.556]  Imagine if a million people did show up with guns.
[01:20:47.896 --> 01:20:48.737]  Yeah, it's true.
[01:20:48.757 --> 01:20:52.181]  And I'm not saying do that, but I'm just saying careful what they claim is going on.
[01:20:52.201 --> 01:20:53.603]  Yeah, calling it an insurrection.
[01:20:53.663 --> 01:20:54.283]  We're good to go.
[01:21:12.791 --> 01:21:15.814]  And I like how Putin mentioned Ashley Babbitt.
[01:21:16.054 --> 01:21:19.177]  You know, people call him a tyrant and a murderer and assassin.
[01:21:19.738 --> 01:21:35.952]  And we, our own government, shot an innocent woman in cold blood, an unarmed woman, just for, you know, she was in the Capitol, yes, but it was, there was no... And it turns out the federal cop that shot her thought he was being shot at.
[01:21:37.354 --> 01:21:37.874]  There's no way.
[01:21:37.974 --> 01:21:38.694]  He just made that up.
[01:21:38.915 --> 01:21:39.595]  Yeah, he just made it up.
[01:21:39.735 --> 01:21:41.096]  After he blasted him.
[01:21:41.236 --> 01:21:42.357]  Yeah, he just made that up.
[01:21:42.417 --> 01:21:44.258]  He, you know, was a quick trigger.
[01:21:44.479 --> 01:21:48.822]  They wanted to set an example, you know, because after that, the protest kind of died down.
[01:21:49.282 --> 01:21:50.503]  But at what cost?
[01:21:50.663 --> 01:21:54.085]  They murdered one of our own and then hunted down others.
[01:21:54.205 --> 01:21:56.267]  Other people were killed on that day as well.
[01:21:56.427 --> 01:21:58.549]  Police brutality, being smothered.
[01:21:59.249 --> 01:21:59.809]  Five people.
[01:22:00.029 --> 01:22:00.990]  Five people, yep.
[01:22:01.130 --> 01:22:03.691]  And we can't forget what they did to us.
[01:22:03.751 --> 01:22:10.194]  We can't forget how they treated us because, like you said, you think it's just going to be limited to mega people?
[01:22:10.274 --> 01:22:13.195]  No, it's going to expand into anybody with a dissident opinion.
[01:22:13.915 --> 01:22:17.477]  Anybody who may be a little right of center.
[01:22:17.697 --> 01:22:22.259]  And they will eventually take more and more territory and come after more and more of us.
[01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:26.322]  Well, that's their plan, but they won't succeed.
[01:22:26.362 --> 01:22:27.103]  They won't get that far.
[01:22:27.123 --> 01:22:28.444]  I think people are starting to wake up.
[01:22:28.764 --> 01:22:31.867]  I think people are starting to wake up about what really happened on J6.
[01:22:32.127 --> 01:22:34.429]  They're starting to wake up about the truth about the war.
[01:22:35.229 --> 01:22:42.315]  Public opinion of more foreign aid for Ukraine started plummeting.
[01:22:43.496 --> 01:22:48.360]  Congress started worrying about their constituency because nobody wanted to send another dime to Ukraine.
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:50.162]  And now they're trying to tie it to border security.
[01:22:50.342 --> 01:22:50.562]  Yeah.
[01:22:50.842 --> 01:22:51.042]  Yep.
[01:22:51.203 --> 01:22:54.384]  And they're like, okay, well, our people want border security.
[01:22:54.424 --> 01:23:01.028]  So in order for you to have border security, you're going to have to give, what was it, $40 billion to Ukraine?
[01:23:01.148 --> 01:23:06.031]  I think it was some ridiculous number, but it was three times more than what they had offered for.
[01:23:06.051 --> 01:23:07.332]  Yeah, I've got the numbers right here.
[01:23:07.352 --> 01:23:07.992]  We can go over those.
[01:23:08.232 --> 01:23:09.333]  Let's play this clip here.
[01:23:10.785 --> 01:23:11.866]  That's what Patrick McDavid said.
[01:23:11.906 --> 01:23:12.866]  Call it the Ukraine bill.
[01:23:13.227 --> 01:23:13.807]  Yeah.
[01:23:13.887 --> 01:23:14.708]  It's not the border bill.
[01:23:15.288 --> 01:23:21.432]  But then it gives billions to the NGOs to keep bringing the illegal aliens in, and it makes Biden basically a dictator over the border.
[01:23:21.912 --> 01:23:22.713]  Let's play this clip.
[01:23:22.753 --> 01:23:29.417]  Biden, I wear my Ukraine tie, my Ukraine pin, which I've been wearing because they're in dire straits.
[01:23:30.037 --> 01:23:31.759]  I thought they kicked the Russians' asses.
[01:23:32.699 --> 01:23:34.180]  I thought that it was a cakewalk.
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:36.462]  No, this war was... I mean, notice suddenly...
[01:23:38.863 --> 01:23:40.265]  Ukraine's invincible, blah, blah, blah.
[01:23:40.285 --> 01:23:42.267]  And all of a sudden, oh no, Ukraine's in dire straits.
[01:23:42.947 --> 01:23:51.416]  Yeah, so Ukraine... Zelensky would have surrendered two years ago and saved hundreds of thousands of lives had the U.S.
[01:23:51.636 --> 01:23:55.500]  not gotten involved and started funding it, providing military aid.
[01:23:55.961 --> 01:23:57.142]  We're sending our own...
[01:23:58.683 --> 01:24:00.224]  Some of our own people over there.
[01:24:00.824 --> 01:24:03.845]  And it would have ended a long time ago had they not had our support.
[01:24:03.885 --> 01:24:06.626]  Hundreds of thousands of people would still be alive.
[01:24:06.646 --> 01:24:09.747]  You know, it is a white Christian slaughter over there in Ukraine.
[01:24:09.807 --> 01:24:12.188]  It never should have escalated into this.
[01:24:12.208 --> 01:24:14.049]  And NATO brags.
[01:24:14.409 --> 01:24:15.310]  Victoria Nidland brags.
[01:24:15.330 --> 01:24:16.110]  She started the whole thing.
[01:24:17.089 --> 01:24:20.711]  I mean, it's just this whole war has been a ginormous lie.
[01:24:21.171 --> 01:24:25.834]  And every time Zelensky, we ever hear from him, it's just when he's begging for more money.
[01:24:25.854 --> 01:24:29.555]  And you remember when he said, you know, he was like, well, if you can't give us money, give us credit.
[01:24:29.836 --> 01:24:30.916]  You know, and we'll pay you back.
[01:24:31.036 --> 01:24:32.537]  Do you think we're ever going to get that money back?
[01:24:32.557 --> 01:24:35.238]  He also said, if you don't give us money, it'll be your sons and daughters.
[01:24:35.278 --> 01:24:35.919]  Yes, yes.
[01:24:35.959 --> 01:24:37.399]  And they threatened that as well.
[01:24:37.419 --> 01:24:38.120]  They threatened us.
[01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:39.380]  They threatened us into paying them.
[01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:43.863]  But about three years ago, when Soros could still talk, maybe they could find the club, he only played it once.
[01:24:43.883 --> 01:24:44.723]  I was thinking about it the other day.
[01:24:44.743 --> 01:24:45.704]  I go, God, that clip's incredible.
[01:24:47.555 --> 01:24:50.116]  NPR or something, but he's like, I told them.
[01:24:52.157 --> 01:24:52.877]  Now he can't even talk.
[01:24:54.097 --> 01:25:03.841]  I told them that I overthrew Ukraine nine years ago, and I will be the czar of Russia.
[01:25:06.022 --> 01:25:08.403]  But he's just, hey guys, play the clip of Biden.
[01:25:10.504 --> 01:25:12.945]  This bill would also address two other important priorities.
[01:25:13.805 --> 01:25:16.706]  First, it provides urgent funding for Ukraine.
[01:25:17.608 --> 01:25:25.674]  I'm wearing my Ukraine tie, my Ukraine pin, which I've been wearing because they're in dire straits right now defending themselves against a Russian onslaught.
[01:25:26.634 --> 01:25:27.695]  A brutal conquest.
[01:25:28.536 --> 01:25:29.536]  The clock is ticking.
[01:25:30.537 --> 01:25:33.079]  Every week, every month, it passes.
[01:25:33.699 --> 01:25:43.166]  Without new aid, Ukraine means fewer artillery shells, fewer air defense systems, fewer tools for Ukraine to defend itself against this Russian onslaught.
[01:25:43.826 --> 01:25:45.047]  Just what Putin wants.
[01:25:46.627 --> 01:25:51.749]  So they go in nine years ago with all the State Department money.
[01:25:51.929 --> 01:25:55.250]  Soros goes on, Farid Zakaria on CNN and brags five years ago they overthrew it.
[01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:58.991]  They start ethnically cleansing the Russians that are the majority population.
[01:25:59.712 --> 01:26:03.193]  And then Putin says, I'm going to take part of the east of the security zone if you don't stop.
[01:26:03.893 --> 01:26:04.773]  He goes, okay, fine.
[01:26:05.614 --> 01:26:09.015]  I'll take Crimea first to show you five years ago or six years ago.
[01:26:09.375 --> 01:26:10.615]  Okay, that didn't convince you?
[01:26:10.796 --> 01:26:11.536]  Now I'm going to do this.
[01:26:12.501 --> 01:26:13.122]  No, absolutely not.
[01:26:23.447 --> 01:26:30.892]  When the Nord Stream pipeline was blown up, it was because they were trying to remove the option of Russian support.
[01:26:31.073 --> 01:26:38.858]  It was, you know, they were providing natural gas to Germany and other countries, and they removed that obstacle for them.
[01:26:38.918 --> 01:26:39.859]  And then blamed the Russians.
[01:26:40.039 --> 01:26:41.280]  Yep, and then blamed the Russians.
[01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:44.862]  When obviously, I mean, it didn't make any sense for Russians.
[01:26:44.882 --> 01:26:46.263]  Well, Cy Hirst got the witnesses.
[01:26:46.303 --> 01:26:47.364]  They came forward.
[01:26:48.865 --> 01:26:49.606]  It was Navy divers.
[01:26:50.413 --> 01:26:50.913]  Now, who is that?
[01:26:51.174 --> 01:26:51.834]  Navy divers.
[01:26:52.014 --> 01:26:52.454]  Oh, yeah.
[01:26:52.534 --> 01:26:52.734]  Okay.
[01:26:52.775 --> 01:26:54.636]  So we knew it was, oh, so U.S.
[01:26:54.676 --> 01:26:55.336]  Navy divers.
[01:26:55.977 --> 01:26:56.577]  Interesting.
[01:26:56.657 --> 01:27:02.421]  So we knew that, I mean, there was obviously Ukrainian involvement in that.
[01:27:02.481 --> 01:27:03.181]  However, you know.
[01:27:03.241 --> 01:27:05.102]  Oh, they're just puppets.
[01:27:05.803 --> 01:27:07.143]  Cy Hirsch got the documents.
[01:27:08.344 --> 01:27:12.047]  Special operations is under congressional control, the Navy SEALs.
[01:27:12.067 --> 01:27:15.869]  So they went to Panama and trained regular industrial Navy divers for it.
[01:27:17.551 --> 01:27:28.035]  And you can't tell me Putin hasn't practiced great restraint during this time because he has not escalated this into a nuclear Armageddon or some giant nuclear race war.
[01:27:28.115 --> 01:27:37.198]  He has really just practiced restraint in all of this when he had every right to probably go scorched earth over there and the extent that they went to to try and defeat him.
[01:27:37.218 --> 01:27:37.758]  However, Russia...
[01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:43.361]  They were always going to win.
[01:27:43.822 --> 01:27:46.124]  It's been a money dump, is what it has been.
[01:27:46.184 --> 01:27:48.607]  The last few dollars out of the U.S.
[01:27:48.667 --> 01:27:52.651]  Treasury that they can dump into the hands of the most corrupt people in Ukraine.
[01:27:52.791 --> 01:27:54.332]  Ukraine is known for their corruption.
[01:27:54.633 --> 01:27:57.596]  They are known for stolen elections.
[01:27:57.696 --> 01:28:04.142]  Zelensky was installed in order to... And he was funded by Igor Kolomoisky, who also...
[01:28:04.983 --> 01:28:06.044]  Basically made him famous.
[01:28:06.084 --> 01:28:14.312]  So he put him on a television network show, built Zelensky up as this presidential figure, and then helped get him into office.
[01:28:16.644 --> 01:28:16.884]  Sorry.
[01:28:17.124 --> 01:28:17.765]  Excuse me.
[01:28:17.785 --> 01:28:19.505]  So it was all a setup.
[01:28:19.865 --> 01:28:21.026]  They knew years ago.
[01:28:21.126 --> 01:28:23.827]  I had friends going to war in Ukraine, U.S.
[01:28:23.867 --> 01:28:25.488]  military, in 2018.
[01:28:26.228 --> 01:28:28.449]  So what were they planning even back then?
[01:28:28.549 --> 01:28:29.130]  Absolutely.
[01:28:29.170 --> 01:28:30.910]  That's what I was told by people I know.
[01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:31.551]  All right.
[01:28:31.611 --> 01:28:32.911]  I want to shift gears to the board.
[01:28:32.951 --> 01:28:34.092]  That's really got people's attention.
[01:28:34.512 --> 01:28:37.593]  They're trying to spend as much as they can, but they're not able to do it.
[01:28:37.613 --> 01:28:39.934]  We've got all the clips to prove that Biden is lying.
[01:28:40.434 --> 01:28:42.395]  I know listeners and viewers, you know he's lying.
[01:28:42.435 --> 01:28:45.637]  But we're going to show it for the few folks out there that may still be on the fence.
[01:28:46.784 --> 01:28:48.367]  Our guest, Lauren Wenske, is here with us.
[01:28:48.427 --> 01:28:50.169]  Filmmaker, talk show host, great lady.
[01:28:51.471 --> 01:28:56.620]  And coming up, Drew Hernandez in the third hour from the Mexico-California border.
[01:28:58.510 --> 01:29:01.052]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalist.
[01:29:01.432 --> 01:29:03.794]  And people can't identify who's a patron and who isn't.
[01:29:04.115 --> 01:29:07.257]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalist.
[01:29:07.317 --> 01:29:10.220]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:21.049]  That's why I designed this amazing 1776 red, white, and blue Gadsden flag shirt so you can support the InfoWar and meet like-minded people everywhere when you wear it.
[01:29:21.169 --> 01:29:21.670]  We're good to go.
[01:29:37.529 --> 01:29:42.774]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is antithetical, the complete opposite of what the globalists are pushing.
[01:29:43.034 --> 01:29:50.842]  So get both the Team Humanity and the 1776 Gadsden Snake Shirts Limited Edition at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[01:29:51.222 --> 01:29:55.006]  Spread the word, meet like-minded people, and fund the 1776 revolution worldwide.
[01:29:58.294 --> 01:30:01.839]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[01:30:02.219 --> 01:30:09.249]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[01:30:09.429 --> 01:30:11.432]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[01:30:11.612 --> 01:30:12.674]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[01:30:12.694 --> 01:30:13.395]  He loved the idea.
[01:30:13.735 --> 01:30:17.236]  What would you call the debate and discussion about a pro-human future?
[01:30:17.256 --> 01:30:18.157]  Just Team Humanity?
[01:30:18.217 --> 01:30:19.097]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[01:30:19.237 --> 01:30:19.697]  Absolutely.
[01:30:19.997 --> 01:30:21.398]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[01:30:21.458 --> 01:30:24.939]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[01:30:25.139 --> 01:30:32.562]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to give InfoWars on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[01:30:33.102 --> 01:30:34.343]  Thank you all for your support.
[01:30:59.426 --> 01:31:06.530]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large.
[01:31:07.111 --> 01:31:14.875]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep support formula, Down and Out, is just the thing.
[01:31:15.656 --> 01:31:22.040]  It's our new faster absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[01:31:22.685 --> 01:31:23.486]  We're good to go.
[01:31:41.783 --> 01:31:46.406]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will be down and out.
[01:31:58.354 --> 01:32:02.456]  InfoWarsStore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.
[01:32:03.056 --> 01:32:05.097]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[01:32:05.117 --> 01:32:06.757]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[01:32:07.077 --> 01:32:09.298]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[01:32:09.558 --> 01:32:10.259]  Hey, what's better?
[01:32:10.359 --> 01:32:10.859]  Knockout.
[01:32:11.219 --> 01:32:11.799]  What's better?
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:13.020]  Down and out.
[01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:13.780]  What's better?
[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:15.421]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[01:32:16.101 --> 01:32:21.023]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different people.
[01:32:21.716 --> 01:32:25.319]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:27.001]  That's how our bodies work.
[01:32:27.021 --> 01:32:27.942]  They're all very diverse.
[01:32:28.322 --> 01:32:38.511]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night Sleep.
[01:32:39.252 --> 01:32:44.635]  This is a great formula full of amazing safe compounds that give you deeper, cleaner, restful sleep.

[01:32:51.318 --> 01:32:52.279]  Good night's sleep today.
[01:32:52.619 --> 01:32:57.282]  InfoWars.com.
[01:33:00.964 --> 01:33:06.847]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:20.167 --> 01:33:21.129]  You are the resistance.
[01:33:21.189 --> 01:33:23.291]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.994 --> 01:33:31.215]  We're in Moscow tonight.
[01:33:31.255 --> 01:33:34.218]  We're here to interview the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin.
[01:33:34.298 --> 01:33:35.399]  We'll be doing that soon.
[01:33:36.159 --> 01:33:42.244]  There are risks to conducting an interview like this, obviously, so we've thought about it carefully over many months.
[01:33:42.725 --> 01:33:43.585]  Here's why we're doing it.
[01:33:44.466 --> 01:33:45.827]  First, because it's our job.
[01:33:46.128 --> 01:33:46.968]  We're in journalism.
[01:33:47.509 --> 01:33:49.410]  Our duty is to inform people.
[01:33:50.345 --> 01:33:55.727]  Two years into a war that's reshaping the entire world, most Americans are not informed.
[01:33:56.067 --> 01:34:02.010]  They have no real idea what's happening in this region, here in Russia or 600 miles away in Ukraine.
[01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:03.550]  But they should know.
[01:34:04.011 --> 01:34:07.912]  They're paying for much of it, in ways they might not fully yet perceive.
[01:34:08.953 --> 01:34:11.114]  The war in Ukraine is a human disaster.
[01:34:11.494 --> 01:34:19.357]  It's left hundreds of thousands of people dead, an entire generation of young Ukrainians, and it's depopulated the largest country in Europe.
[01:34:20.592 --> 01:34:23.018]  But the long-term effects are even more profound.
[01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:28.331]  This war has utterly reshaped the global military and trade alliances.
[01:34:29.190 --> 01:34:31.132]  And the sanctions that followed have as well.
[01:34:31.512 --> 01:34:34.235]  And in total, they have upended the world economy.
[01:34:35.136 --> 01:34:44.925]  The post-World War II economic order, the system that guaranteed prosperity in the West for more than 80 years, is coming apart very fast, and along with it, the dominance of the U.S.
[01:34:44.965 --> 01:34:45.325]  dollar.
[01:34:46.206 --> 01:34:47.707]  These are not small changes.
[01:34:47.787 --> 01:34:50.009]  They are history-altering developments.
[01:34:50.570 --> 01:34:52.432]  They will define the lives of our grandchildren.
[01:34:53.416 --> 01:34:55.157]  Most of the world understands this perfectly well.
[01:34:55.177 --> 01:34:55.878]  They can see it.
[01:34:56.338 --> 01:34:59.621]  Ask anyone in Asia or the Middle East what the future looks like.
[01:35:00.782 --> 01:35:04.485]  And yet the populations of the English-speaking countries seem mostly unaware.
[01:35:05.125 --> 01:35:07.007]  They think that nothing has really changed.
[01:35:07.307 --> 01:35:10.569]  And they think that because no one has told them the truth.
[01:35:11.370 --> 01:35:13.131]  Their media outlets are corrupt.
[01:35:13.432 --> 01:35:15.313]  They lie to their readers and viewers.
[01:35:15.853 --> 01:35:17.535]  And they do that mostly by omission.
[01:35:18.783 --> 01:35:29.552]  For example, since the day the war in Ukraine began, American media outlets have spoken to scores of people from Ukraine, and they've done scores of interviews with Ukrainian President Zelensky.
[01:35:30.353 --> 01:35:33.715]  We ourselves have put in a request for an interview with Zelensky, and we hope he accepts.
[01:35:34.496 --> 01:35:37.799]  But the interviews he's already done in the United States are not traditional interviews.
[01:35:38.499 --> 01:35:43.984]  They are fawning pep sessions specifically designed to amplify Zelensky's demand that the U.S.
[01:35:44.084 --> 01:35:47.507]  enter more deeply into a war in Eastern Europe and pay for it.
[01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:49.681]  That is not journalism.
[01:35:50.181 --> 01:35:51.482]  It is government propaganda.
[01:35:52.202 --> 01:35:55.104]  Propaganda of the ugliest kind, the kind that kills people.
[01:35:56.144 --> 01:36:09.612]  At the same time, our politicians and media outlets have been doing this, promoting a foreign leader like he's a new consumer brand, not a single Western journalist has bothered to interview the president of the other country involved in this conflict, Vladimir Putin.
[01:36:10.753 --> 01:36:14.955]  Most Americans have no idea why Putin invaded Ukraine, or what his goals are now.
[01:36:15.075 --> 01:36:15.996]  They've never heard his voice.
[01:36:16.917 --> 01:36:17.337]  That's wrong.
[01:36:18.587 --> 01:36:22.368]  Americans have a right to know all they can about a war they're implicated in.
[01:36:22.748 --> 01:36:26.049]  And we have the right to tell them about it because we are Americans too.
[01:36:26.709 --> 01:36:28.629]  Freedom of speech is our birthright.
[01:36:28.829 --> 01:36:31.050]  We were born with the right to say what we believe.
[01:36:31.770 --> 01:36:36.111]  That right cannot be taken away no matter who is in the White House.
[01:36:37.551 --> 01:36:44.593]  Almost three years ago, the Biden administration illegally spied on our text messages and then leaked the contents to their servants in the news media.
[01:36:45.133 --> 01:36:47.634]  They did this in order to stop a Putin interview that we were planning.
[01:36:48.706 --> 01:36:51.990]  Last month, we're pretty certain they did exactly the same thing once again.
[01:36:52.591 --> 01:36:54.893]  But this time, we came to Moscow anyway.
[01:36:56.175 --> 01:36:58.438]  We are not here because we love Vladimir Putin.
[01:36:59.038 --> 01:37:04.064]  We are here because we love the United States, and we want it to remain prosperous and free.
[01:37:05.202 --> 01:37:06.502]  We paid for this trip ourselves.
[01:37:06.522 --> 01:37:08.363]  We took no money from any government or group.
[01:37:09.083 --> 01:37:10.944]  Nor are we charging people to see the interview.
[01:37:10.964 --> 01:37:12.204]  It is not behind a paywall.
[01:37:13.064 --> 01:37:19.466]  Anyone can watch the entire thing, shot live to tape and unedited, on our website, TuckerCarlson.com.
[01:37:20.346 --> 01:37:27.828]  Elon Musk, to his great credit, has promised not to suppress or block this interview once we post it on his platform, X. And we're grateful for that.
[01:37:29.113 --> 01:37:37.039]  Western governments, by contrast, will certainly do their best to censor this video on other less principled platforms because that's what they do.
[01:37:37.319 --> 01:37:39.601]  They are afraid of information they can't control.
[01:37:40.462 --> 01:37:42.423]  But you have no reason to be afraid of it.
[01:37:43.164 --> 01:37:46.887]  We are not encouraging you to agree with what Putin may say in this interview.
[01:37:47.427 --> 01:37:49.108]  But we are urging you to watch it.
[01:37:49.569 --> 01:37:51.490]  You should know as much as you can.
[01:37:51.850 --> 01:37:56.354]  And then, like a free citizen and not a slave, you can decide for yourself.
[01:37:57.214 --> 01:37:57.455]  Thanks.
[01:37:58.903 --> 01:38:03.350]  And again, there's different debates about whether it's going to air at 6 Central, 7 Central.
[01:38:03.390 --> 01:38:07.916]  We'll be here tomorrow covering it live when it happens at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:38:07.936 --> 01:38:15.006]  But what he really said that gets under their skin there is you have a right to see and listen and read what you want.
[01:38:16.277 --> 01:38:18.078]  And then the old global order's coming to an end.
[01:38:18.098 --> 01:38:21.660]  We have an excellent report by Greg Reese that's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:38:22.321 --> 01:38:28.565]  The desperate, failing plan for the new American century that's the big neocon globalist operation.
[01:38:29.405 --> 01:38:32.487]  It's not going well for them, but they keep doubling down.
[01:38:32.527 --> 01:38:34.368]  Lauren Winsky, where do you see this going?
[01:38:34.769 --> 01:38:39.752]  I want to shift gears into the border because it's an example of how they start wars, they destroy borders.
[01:38:40.372 --> 01:38:44.635]  Anything they administratively have control of, they're going to weaponize and use against us, just like the courts.
[01:38:45.017 --> 01:38:48.079]  No, what you're seeing is a globalist war against nationalism.
[01:38:48.459 --> 01:38:52.162]  Now, no matter what you think about Putin, he is a Russian nationalist.
[01:38:52.282 --> 01:38:57.445]  I wish that we had an American leader who loved his country as much as Putin loves Russia.
[01:38:57.585 --> 01:38:57.885]  We did.
[01:38:57.926 --> 01:38:58.426]  We had Trump.
[01:38:58.446 --> 01:38:59.106]  They stole the election.
[01:38:59.226 --> 01:39:00.087]  Yes, exactly.
[01:39:00.367 --> 01:39:04.310]  And you saw this war happen against Donald Trump and what they did to...
[01:39:04.810 --> 01:39:05.510]  We're good to go.
[01:39:05.570 --> 01:39:06.030]  We're good to go.
[01:39:19.995 --> 01:39:21.156]  So we saw what happened there.
[01:39:21.476 --> 01:39:26.381]  Now, against Trump, they're trying to indict him, bankrupt him, break him.
[01:39:26.721 --> 01:39:28.863]  You see that they are absolutely trying to break him.
[01:39:28.883 --> 01:39:33.387]  And the only crime he committed was loving his country and putting America first.
[01:39:33.707 --> 01:39:40.613]  And you see this globalist war on nationalists, nationalist leaders, and that's what's going on.
[01:39:40.653 --> 01:39:44.577]  They can't have that because nationalism is a threat to the global world order.
[01:39:45.785 --> 01:39:47.549]  Gut level, what do you think happens to Tucker now?
[01:39:47.570 --> 01:39:50.296]  I mean, they're going to come after him, but this just makes him bigger.
[01:39:50.978 --> 01:39:52.161]  It's so exciting to watch.
[01:39:52.441 --> 01:39:52.702]  It is.
[01:39:52.762 --> 01:39:54.707]  Well, do you remember what they did to Gonzalo Lira?
[01:39:55.731 --> 01:39:57.813]  You know, they've already killed people before.
[01:39:58.193 --> 01:39:58.953]  It's happened before.
[01:39:58.973 --> 01:40:02.416]  Talk about that, because this hit list they put them on, they're really serious about this.
[01:40:02.496 --> 01:40:03.317]  Yeah, they weren't kidding.
[01:40:03.357 --> 01:40:07.280]  So Gonzalo Lira ended up putting out a video when he first got out of jail in Ukraine.
[01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:09.481]  He's like, I'm going to try and make it to the border.
[01:40:09.902 --> 01:40:14.925]  Only thing he really covered, like they kind of said that he was like making Russian propaganda and all this stuff.
[01:40:14.965 --> 01:40:20.289]  No, he was actually honestly covering the war in Ukraine and what was really going on and exposing corruption going on there.
[01:40:20.529 --> 01:40:22.211]  They couldn't have that, so they threw him in prison.
[01:40:22.591 --> 01:40:26.772]  And then when he was out, they didn't let him leave the country.
[01:40:27.072 --> 01:40:30.353]  They put him back in prison, and then they eventually killed him.
[01:40:31.233 --> 01:40:32.013]  He eventually died.
[01:40:32.133 --> 01:40:38.094]  And notice they say it's the Russians doing this with no evidence to journalists around the world, but then they're doing it out in the open.
[01:40:38.434 --> 01:40:38.595]  Yes.
[01:40:38.715 --> 01:40:40.015]  And the State Department wouldn't lift a finger.
[01:40:40.195 --> 01:40:40.335]  Yep.
[01:40:40.715 --> 01:40:44.596]  Anything they can do to stop this information from getting out from the truth.
[01:40:45.456 --> 01:40:46.237]  Getting out.
[01:40:46.277 --> 01:40:47.117]  They will do anything.
[01:40:47.137 --> 01:40:48.758]  There's no extent to how far they will go.
[01:40:49.219 --> 01:41:03.749]  Do you remember during the election, I stopped the steal, when Tucker Carlson had done a segment on it on Fox News where he had received information about Hunter Biden's business partner, Bobulinski.
[01:41:04.289 --> 01:41:05.090]  And he ended up
[01:41:05.470 --> 01:41:07.311]  When I first broke into Bohemian Grove,
[01:41:32.898 --> 01:41:33.398]  Oh my gosh.
[01:41:33.418 --> 01:41:33.818]  Oh my gosh.
[01:41:54.577 --> 01:41:57.039]  Yeah, and, you know, it's lawlessness.
[01:41:57.259 --> 01:41:59.080]  Laws don't matter anymore in America.
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:01.561]  It's all about what the regime wants you to know.
[01:42:01.742 --> 01:42:05.364]  And there's no extent to how far they won't go in order to stop you.
[01:42:05.504 --> 01:42:07.665]  So I hope he gets it out soon.
[01:42:07.685 --> 01:42:09.006]  I hope the world sees it.
[01:42:09.046 --> 01:42:11.788]  And I hope Tucker Carlson, nothing happens to him.
[01:42:12.088 --> 01:42:14.129]  Well, it's all because they control the Justice Department.
[01:42:14.149 --> 01:42:15.070]  They think they're above the law.
[01:42:15.510 --> 01:42:15.950]  Mm-hmm.
[01:42:16.251 --> 01:42:16.391]  Yep.
[01:42:16.451 --> 01:42:17.391]  All right.
[01:42:17.551 --> 01:42:18.352]  Let's talk about...
[01:42:19.898 --> 01:42:20.578]  The border now.
[01:42:21.379 --> 01:42:22.440]  Here's a clip.
[01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:23.740]  You're an expert on this.
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:24.141]  I watch your show.
[01:42:24.181 --> 01:42:25.361]  I've seen the shows you've done.
[01:42:25.381 --> 01:42:26.642]  You really know what you're talking about.
[01:42:26.662 --> 01:42:27.803]  So I want to get your view on this.
[01:42:30.585 --> 01:42:32.046]  Here's Biden yesterday.
[01:42:32.066 --> 01:42:33.206]  There's a bunch of clips of this.
[01:42:33.226 --> 01:42:34.567]  He talked for like an hour.
[01:42:35.448 --> 01:42:38.150]  Saying that Trump's the reason the border's broken.
[01:42:38.550 --> 01:42:42.232]  But I have the graphs of what happened to the border when Trump was in.
[01:42:42.312 --> 01:42:43.153]  So it's a ball-faced lie.
[01:42:43.193 --> 01:42:46.555]  It's too long, as you all know.
[01:42:46.595 --> 01:42:48.156]  The immigration system has been broken.
[01:42:49.246 --> 01:42:49.846]  We're good to go.
[01:43:11.758 --> 01:43:11.838]  Why?
[01:43:11.878 --> 01:43:12.879]  A simple reason.
[01:43:12.899 --> 01:43:13.299]  Donald Trump.
[01:43:36.391 --> 01:43:38.992]  Because Donald Trump thinks it's bad for him politically.
[01:43:39.152 --> 01:43:43.094]  Therefore, even though it helps the country, he's not for it.
[01:43:43.895 --> 01:43:46.476]  He'd rather weaponize this issue than actually solve it.
[01:43:47.336 --> 01:43:57.922]  So for the last 24 hours, he's done nothing, I'm told, but reach out to Republicans in the House and the Senate and threaten them and try to intimidate them to vote against his proposal.
[01:43:58.822 --> 01:44:00.363]  And it looks like they're caving.
[01:44:01.348 --> 01:44:06.574]  Frankly, they owe it to the American people to show some spine and do what they know to be right.
[01:44:08.376 --> 01:44:13.202]  Lauren, this is some of the most incredible gaslighting, and in a world full of gaslighting, that says a lot.
[01:44:13.242 --> 01:44:20.951]  I mean, it's hard to unpack all the lies, but I can play three or four clips of him saying, when I win the election, surge the border.
[01:44:22.039 --> 01:44:22.700]  We're good to go.
[01:44:44.051 --> 01:44:44.131]  Yes.
[01:44:44.171 --> 01:44:44.271]  Yes.
[01:45:06.971 --> 01:45:07.591]  Well, here it is.
[01:45:08.432 --> 01:45:11.253]  Southwest border apprehensions from the Border Patrol.
[01:45:11.973 --> 01:45:13.093]  Trump gets into office.
[01:45:13.133 --> 01:45:17.955]  It's already surging up because right before Obama left, he said, you know, bring kids, the border's open.
[01:45:19.636 --> 01:45:22.477]  Then Trump was able to get legislation finally through.
[01:45:23.657 --> 01:45:27.379]  Tariff threat leads to Mexican cooperation on remain in Mexico.
[01:45:28.239 --> 01:45:32.381]  So it goes straight up and then straight down to
[01:45:33.664 --> 01:45:38.546]  Until Title 42 is implemented and then it goes down to almost nothing.
[01:45:39.447 --> 01:45:44.429]  So again, Obama weaponizes it, opens it, starts what Biden's continuing.
[01:45:44.989 --> 01:45:46.390]  Trump inherits a problem.
[01:45:46.450 --> 01:45:46.830]  Boom!
[01:45:47.670 --> 01:45:48.631]  Brings it down to here.
[01:45:49.331 --> 01:45:51.612]  It's Title 42 and brings it down to almost zero.
[01:45:53.233 --> 01:45:53.573]  But then...
[01:45:55.319 --> 01:46:03.602]  He gets in, he seals the election, January 20, 2021, opens it completely, and now look where we are.
[01:46:03.962 --> 01:46:04.883]  Oh, wow.
[01:46:04.963 --> 01:46:08.924]  Now, that is the truth, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:09.344 --> 01:46:10.545]  Lauren Witzke, your take on that.
[01:46:10.805 --> 01:46:15.569]  Yeah, I mean, I remember during COVID, Trump called for a complete immigration moratorium.
[01:46:16.010 --> 01:46:17.871]  And I remember that, hey, guess what?
[01:46:18.032 --> 01:46:19.173]  Immigrants stopped coming here.
[01:46:19.373 --> 01:46:20.954]  Now Biden gets into office.
[01:46:21.014 --> 01:46:27.240]  He undoes, I think he does 52 executive orders, undoing everything that the Trump presidency did.
[01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:29.141]  And it was intentional.
[01:46:29.401 --> 01:46:30.102]  It's intentional.
[01:46:30.122 --> 01:46:31.903]  They want people to flood our border.
[01:46:31.923 --> 01:46:35.927]  They want our nation to be in disarray and to be destabilized.
[01:46:36.287 --> 01:46:43.833]  I don't even believe they put any money in the border bill in order to address the opioid or the fentanyl epidemic that's happening in our country.
[01:46:44.753 --> 01:46:48.276]  100,000 Americans dead last year due to fentanyl overdoses.
[01:46:48.416 --> 01:46:51.939]  I, this year, have lost two friends to the opioid epidemic.
[01:46:52.039 --> 01:46:53.600]  And it's getting worse and worse.
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:55.562]  And how does that fentanyl get here?
[01:46:55.942 --> 01:46:57.123]  Well, it comes from China.
[01:46:57.383 --> 01:46:59.625]  It goes to Mexico and across our southern border.
[01:46:59.645 --> 01:47:00.745]  They're walking it right across.
[01:47:00.785 --> 01:47:02.086]  They're taking it to the inner cities.
[01:47:02.366 --> 01:47:08.010]  And then they're giving it, selling it to American kids and killing them with no regard for human life whatsoever.
[01:47:08.050 --> 01:47:08.991]  These people aren't human.
[01:47:09.711 --> 01:47:12.953]  So that is who Joe Biden is welcoming into our country.
[01:47:13.374 --> 01:47:17.476]  And that is what actually this border bill ends up facilitating more of.
[01:47:17.756 --> 01:47:20.318]  What was it, like 5,000 migrants can come in a day?
[01:47:20.338 --> 01:47:22.340]  And the money was to...
[01:47:23.180 --> 01:47:28.406]  Figure out how you can register them quicker and get them legally here safe instead of just here.
[01:47:28.426 --> 01:47:29.547]  Yeah, it's an amnesty bill.
[01:47:29.707 --> 01:47:33.792]  And he can also declare an emergency or, quote, undeclared one and do whatever he wants.
[01:47:34.733 --> 01:47:35.954]  What do you make of Mayorkas?
[01:47:36.755 --> 01:47:39.678]  House fails to impeach Mayorkas before Republicans join Democrats.
[01:47:39.898 --> 01:47:41.019]  No, I think that's disgusting.
[01:47:41.079 --> 01:47:52.126]  So, reportedly, one of the Congress people said, oh, I just voted, I want Mayorkas impeached, but I voted no because he was waiting for Steve Scalise to come back so he could vote.
[01:47:52.486 --> 01:47:54.968]  I don't know if that's necessarily true or if that's a giant cope.
[01:47:55.068 --> 01:47:59.171]  However, I hope this isn't over because what I saw yesterday, there was no excuse.
[01:47:59.231 --> 01:48:03.874]  Mayorkas, this is an intentional invasion is what is happening.
[01:48:04.274 --> 01:48:09.017]  People don't know that Mayorkas used to work, he was the board member for HIAS, the Immigrant
[01:48:10.198 --> 01:48:10.458]  Thank you.
[01:48:26.730 --> 01:48:30.674]  Now, Mayorkas is the greatest human trafficker in modern history.
[01:48:30.834 --> 01:48:32.056]  He is the pedophile in chief.
[01:48:46.391 --> 01:48:53.218]  90-plus thousand children, it was 80-something, the number's above 90 now, since Biden took over, that they handed over that they're missing.
[01:48:53.518 --> 01:48:53.698]  Yes.
[01:48:53.918 --> 01:48:54.219]  Of 500,000.
[01:48:54.639 --> 01:48:57.001]  So Mayorkas is a pedophile.
[01:48:57.302 --> 01:49:02.727]  Whether he's raping kids or not, he is facilitating the mass sexual abuse of children.
[01:49:02.827 --> 01:49:04.828]  Yep, and they were recycling these children, too.
[01:49:05.249 --> 01:49:06.690]  It's not just they get into the country.
[01:49:06.710 --> 01:49:08.911]  Oh, yeah, there's a new video out where they bring them over and over again.
[01:49:09.031 --> 01:49:10.172]  Yep, these little children.
[01:49:10.352 --> 01:49:16.416]  There are horror stories of what is happening to these little children, and it's our fault because we are allowing it to happen.
[01:49:16.736 --> 01:49:18.958]  A strong border wall stops these people from...
[01:49:19.318 --> 01:49:19.938]  We're good to go.
[01:49:49.598 --> 01:49:51.100]  Well, I don't care if they're black, white, or brown.
[01:49:51.140 --> 01:49:59.208]  There's homeless people everywhere of every color, crime everywhere, stuff not working, things breaking, prices exploding.
[01:49:59.228 --> 01:50:00.750]  I mean, we're being royally screwed.
[01:50:01.210 --> 01:50:03.533]  Here is clip 10.
[01:50:03.593 --> 01:50:11.761]  This is a clip of Biden and Gavin Newsom before they shifted to this whole claim that Trump broke the border.
[01:50:11.981 --> 01:50:12.342]  Here they are.
[01:50:13.635 --> 01:50:15.496]  So let's just state the facts.
[01:50:16.017 --> 01:50:21.701]  We are currently experiencing the lowest number of border crossings since 1971.
[01:50:21.761 --> 01:50:31.268]  In California, like our nation, our undocumented population is at the lowest level in more than a decade.
[01:50:32.099 --> 01:50:36.142]  Mr. Vice President, under the Trump administration, asylum has virtually ended.
[01:50:40.244 --> 01:50:44.126]  Your new plan calls for reversing President Trump's harsh plan.
[01:50:44.947 --> 01:50:47.909]  But won't that restart a brand new border crisis?
[01:50:48.049 --> 01:50:53.672]  I mean, what would you do with all those people in camps now waiting in Mexico?
[01:50:55.173 --> 01:50:57.154]  It will if we don't do it well.
[01:50:57.174 --> 01:50:59.436]  If we don't reach out
[01:51:00.057 --> 01:51:20.190]  To the communities that are willing to, the charitable communities that will come in and help, and in addition to us spending millions of dollars providing for access, access for judges, access for asylum folks to be on the border, to move quickly.
[01:51:21.831 --> 01:51:23.953]  So it's another clip of him basically saying search the border.
[01:51:25.703 --> 01:51:27.024]  We need more illegal aliens.
[01:51:28.025 --> 01:51:28.906]  Trump's stopping it.
[01:51:28.946 --> 01:51:30.488]  Years later, Trump opened the border.
[01:51:31.710 --> 01:51:33.270]  No, no, it's, yeah, it's Trump's fault.
[01:51:33.310 --> 01:51:35.051]  This is all Trump's fault.
[01:51:35.291 --> 01:51:40.372]  But, you know, that was the only excuse they have because Democrats actually have the executive branch.
[01:51:40.512 --> 01:51:44.392]  They're actually the ones in charge, and this invasion is on them.
[01:51:44.512 --> 01:51:46.353]  It wasn't in existence.
[01:51:46.433 --> 01:51:47.553]  The graph doesn't lie.
[01:51:47.573 --> 01:51:47.833]  Nope.
[01:51:47.913 --> 01:51:57.235]  He inherits Obama accelerating an attack, takes him a year or so to start cutting it down, cuts it down 60, 70 percent, and then cuts it down 90 plus percent.
[01:51:57.995 --> 01:51:58.275]  Boom.
[01:51:58.375 --> 01:51:59.455]  And then Biden gets in.
[01:52:00.036 --> 01:52:00.696]  Numbers don't lie.
[01:52:00.716 --> 01:52:01.036]  Look at that.
[01:52:01.136 --> 01:52:02.416]  No, it absolutely does not lie.
[01:52:02.576 --> 01:52:08.198]  And, you know, there was also in the beginning those caravans that they kept funding to come into our country.
[01:52:08.238 --> 01:52:11.458]  You know, I have no doubt that somebody is paying for these caravans.
[01:52:11.498 --> 01:52:18.260]  These people don't just drop everything and move across, you know, travel across the country to come to America without funding.
[01:52:18.340 --> 01:52:19.220]  Well, they've got the U.N.
[01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:19.961]  camps and all of it.
[01:52:19.981 --> 01:52:22.341]  You know what this graph reminds me of right here?
[01:52:22.821 --> 01:52:24.982]  Right when Biden steals the election and gets into power,
[01:52:25.922 --> 01:52:27.483]  The number of illegal aliens explodes.
[01:52:27.824 --> 01:52:36.210]  Just like all the graphs of they start the COVID shots and the heart attacks, the blood clots, the strokes, the cancer, all does the same thing on the graph.
[01:52:36.670 --> 01:52:37.991]  You're a conspiracy theorist.
[01:52:38.051 --> 01:52:38.692]  You know that, right?
[01:52:38.912 --> 01:52:39.092]  Yeah.
[01:52:39.372 --> 01:52:45.757]  I can just look at that and say, look, Biden gets in and then it goes exactly like, oh, just instead of debating that, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[01:52:45.797 --> 01:52:48.159]  Yeah, they're trying to convince you that what you're seeing is not real.
[01:52:48.359 --> 01:52:50.501]  That is like the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[01:52:50.541 --> 01:52:52.222]  And they are very, very good at that.
[01:52:52.623 --> 01:52:53.644]  But, you know, it's...
[01:52:54.687 --> 01:53:03.698]  The fact that they come into our country and they know that they'll get a plane ticket, a four-star hotel, a meal, a cell phone, new clothes.
[01:53:04.319 --> 01:53:05.340]  Why wouldn't they come?
[01:53:05.801 --> 01:53:10.446]  We have got to cut off the benefits that these immigrants are receiving and they'd stop coming.
[01:53:10.466 --> 01:53:10.547]  Okay.
[01:53:11.167 --> 01:53:13.848]  That's pretty obvious, and I know the Biden administration knows that.
[01:53:14.168 --> 01:53:16.209]  However, they don't want them not to come.
[01:53:16.329 --> 01:53:17.049]  They want them here.
[01:53:17.129 --> 01:53:21.911]  They want them here just in time to destabilize the population before the election.
[01:53:22.191 --> 01:53:24.112]  And I think it's going to end up being a terrorist attack.
[01:53:24.152 --> 01:53:25.453]  I think they're planning a terrorist attack.
[01:53:25.473 --> 01:53:30.735]  They're letting these Middle Eastern migrants, these migrants come in across our country, our southern border.
[01:53:31.935 --> 01:53:33.196]  There was a video of one of them.
[01:53:34.671 --> 01:53:35.552]  Oh, you're going to learn soon!
[01:53:56.032 --> 01:53:56.953]  Oh, I don't think that's debatable.
[01:53:56.973 --> 01:53:58.014]  I think that's a fact, and...
[01:54:23.973 --> 01:54:24.713]  We're good to go.
[01:54:24.773 --> 01:54:25.033]  I think?
[01:54:47.138 --> 01:54:54.822]  Why on earth would you run a war drill about a terrorist attack in America over the elections unless you're learning how to execute it?
[01:54:54.842 --> 01:54:56.343]  I saw Operation Blackout.
[01:54:56.403 --> 01:54:57.224]  I mentioned it a few times.
[01:54:57.284 --> 01:55:00.185]  I'm glad you remind me of that because that's critical information.
[01:55:00.205 --> 01:55:03.407]  It's kind of like Operation Lockstep or Event 201 predicting COVID.
[01:55:03.587 --> 01:55:04.188]  Yep, it's true.
[01:55:04.288 --> 01:55:05.789]  And you know what their solution was?
[01:55:06.029 --> 01:55:18.199]  They said, in order for us to prevent a terrorist attack over the election, we have got to pre-select and pre-place Department of Homeland Security over the elections proactively in order to protect the election.
[01:55:18.219 --> 01:55:18.459]  That's right.
[01:55:18.479 --> 01:55:19.900]  They'll protect the election by running it.
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:20.180]  Yep.
[01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:22.662]  And that's their answer to make sure the feds can fully steal it.
[01:55:22.902 --> 01:55:27.626]  Do you see all the new documents coming with the state police in Michigan where they found the safe houses with the fake ballots and everything?
[01:55:28.907 --> 01:55:29.608]  No, I did not.
[01:55:30.279 --> 01:55:30.579]  Barely.
[01:55:30.779 --> 01:55:31.840]  Gateway Pundit covered it.
[01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:32.340]  We covered it.
[01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:34.181]  OAN did.
[01:55:35.742 --> 01:55:39.264]  In fact, the first five minutes of the next hour, she leaves us.
[01:55:39.284 --> 01:55:43.026]  I had Drew Hernandez joining us from the Mexico-California border.
[01:55:43.566 --> 01:55:44.046]  Get that.
[01:55:44.207 --> 01:55:46.088]  It's like I said, OAN, like two and a half minute clip.
[01:55:46.208 --> 01:55:47.068]  It only covers part of it.
[01:55:47.969 --> 01:55:48.769]  I played it Sunday.
[01:55:49.289 --> 01:55:53.311]  But man, it is just... I posted it on Twitter.
[01:55:54.392 --> 01:55:56.433]  It's called the smoking gun of 2020 election.
[01:55:56.813 --> 01:55:57.614]  But it's just crazy.
[01:55:57.654 --> 01:55:57.834]  Yeah.
[01:55:59.042 --> 01:55:59.382]  Absolutely.
[01:55:59.402 --> 01:56:00.403]  So it's not surprising that...
[01:56:26.254 --> 01:56:28.155]  Well, Lauren Wiskey, I'm excited you're here in town.
[01:56:28.175 --> 01:56:28.895]  You're a filmmaker.
[01:56:28.915 --> 01:56:31.237]  Hopefully we're going to do a film together or something down the road.
[01:56:31.257 --> 01:56:31.617]  Yeah, let's do it.
[01:56:31.637 --> 01:56:32.037]  Let's go.
[01:56:32.657 --> 01:56:34.038]  And you've got a lot of other stuff going on.
[01:56:34.198 --> 01:56:35.019]  Yes, yes, we do.
[01:56:35.399 --> 01:56:36.980]  All right, well, I was supposed to have you on yesterday.
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:38.981]  I was supposed to meet with you about that, but I had to run off.
[01:56:39.001 --> 01:56:40.682]  But I'll talk to you after the show, too.
[01:56:41.062 --> 01:56:42.703]  I appreciate you staying, and it's great to have you here.
[01:56:42.723 --> 01:56:43.763]  Thank you so much for having me.
[01:56:44.023 --> 01:56:45.184]  Where do people find all your great work?
[01:56:45.504 --> 01:56:49.926]  Oh, you can follow me on Twitter at LaurenWhitskyDE.
[01:56:49.986 --> 01:56:51.988]  I'm also on Telegram and Gab, of course.
[01:56:52.048 --> 01:56:57.130]  So just go ahead and give me a follow, and I will keep you posted on all of our upcoming work.
[01:56:57.430 --> 01:56:58.651]  LaurenWhitskyDE.
[01:56:58.691 --> 01:56:59.592]  What's the DE stand for?
[01:56:59.692 --> 01:57:00.072]  Delaware.
[01:57:00.092 --> 01:57:00.832]  I'm from Delaware.
[01:57:01.092 --> 01:57:01.673]  That's right.
[01:57:01.713 --> 01:57:02.993]  Yep, originally from Delaware.
[01:57:03.114 --> 01:57:07.276]  Yep, and I'm a Florida refugee from Delaware because Joe Biden chased me and my family out, so...
[01:57:07.924 --> 01:57:08.425]  Really?
[01:57:08.465 --> 01:57:09.466]  That's a whole other story, isn't it?
[01:57:09.526 --> 01:57:10.887]  Yeah, that is a whole other story.
[01:57:10.907 --> 01:57:14.251]  Yeah, they removed my brother from the Delaware Bar.
[01:57:14.732 --> 01:57:16.113]  They're still coming after him.
[01:57:16.213 --> 01:57:19.657]  They never forgave me for challenging the status quo.
[01:57:19.717 --> 01:57:20.018]  That's right.
[01:57:20.038 --> 01:57:21.920]  You ran for Senate.
[01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:22.601]  Yes, I did.
[01:57:22.921 --> 01:57:23.321]  Yes, I did.
[01:57:23.341 --> 01:57:24.302]  I remember having you on when you did it.
[01:57:24.602 --> 01:57:25.823]  Yep, yep, yep.
[01:57:26.063 --> 01:57:26.784]  I had a great time.
[01:57:27.484 --> 01:57:29.566]  InfoWars was a great supporter of my U.S.
[01:57:29.586 --> 01:57:35.570]  Senate campaign, ran on an immigration moratorium, and broke the Delaware record in most GOP U.S.
[01:57:35.590 --> 01:57:37.831]  Senate candidate votes in Delaware history.
[01:57:38.011 --> 01:57:40.833]  So there's something more to the immigration crisis.
[01:57:40.913 --> 01:57:41.794]  Everybody cares about it.
[01:57:42.154 --> 01:57:42.775]  Great job.
[01:57:42.815 --> 01:57:43.515]  Thank you so much.
[01:57:43.975 --> 01:57:44.556]  Talk to you soon.
[01:57:44.576 --> 01:57:45.977]  We'll be right back with hour number three.
[01:57:50.834 --> 01:57:52.075]  Gunther in Tennessee.
[01:57:52.115 --> 01:57:53.176]  Thanks for calling, Gunther.
[01:57:53.316 --> 01:57:53.676]  Hey, Alex.
[01:57:53.856 --> 01:57:54.617]  First time caller.
[01:57:54.697 --> 01:57:56.538]  Real quick, wanted to plug your foundational energy.
[01:57:57.098 --> 01:57:58.059]  Just started taking that.
[01:57:58.719 --> 01:58:03.022]  And, boy, three pills, recommended dose, I was bouncing off the walls.
[01:58:03.142 --> 01:58:08.766]  But I tell you, foundational is the right name for that product because I'll cut down to one.
[01:58:09.887 --> 01:58:13.630]  It's like you have a baseline of energy that you were missing before that you got back.
[01:58:13.770 --> 01:58:13.870]  Cool.
[01:58:14.070 --> 01:58:22.293]  Well, I'm glad you mentioned that because it's methylfolate, the breakdown of folic acid, and a lot of people, particularly Europeans, don't absorb all of the folic acid.
[01:58:22.533 --> 01:58:23.634]  So it's not a stimulant.
[01:58:23.854 --> 01:58:27.255]  It's a totally natural thing that boosts energy that's foundational.
[01:58:27.555 --> 01:58:30.116]  And was I lying to you or did it not work?
[01:58:30.797 --> 01:58:31.997]  No, it was top-notch.
[01:58:32.037 --> 01:58:35.659]  And I was actually taking Red Pill Plus before, and that's got a little folic acid in it.
[01:58:35.719 --> 01:58:39.520]  I think there was a little buildup from this, but the energy from this was no jitters.
[01:58:39.700 --> 01:58:40.621]  I mean, it's top-notch.
[01:58:40.641 --> 01:58:41.421]  It's a great product.
[01:58:41.837 --> 01:58:42.798]  Well, thank you so much.
[01:58:42.838 --> 01:58:46.601]  Yeah, no, folic acid's great and it's in real red pill, but some can't break it down.
[01:58:46.641 --> 01:58:47.662]  This is the breakdown of it.
[01:58:47.702 --> 01:58:48.483]  That's exactly it.
[01:58:49.083 --> 01:58:51.365]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[01:58:51.525 --> 01:58:51.866]  Thank you.
[01:58:52.066 --> 01:58:54.628]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[01:58:54.688 --> 01:58:55.949]  I started taking that stuff.
[01:58:55.989 --> 01:58:59.192]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[01:58:59.312 --> 01:59:00.193]  When did you start taking it?
[01:59:00.473 --> 01:59:04.457]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[01:59:04.557 --> 01:59:04.817]  Mm-hmm.
[01:59:05.077 --> 01:59:07.778]  And I started eating a little better, but my blood pressure stayed high.
[01:59:07.798 --> 01:59:15.322]  And when I took the X2 iodine after about two or four weeks, I think my body was detoxified of a bunch of metals and stuff that my body was storing.
[01:59:15.442 --> 01:59:17.643]  And my blood pressure came down to the perfect level.
[01:59:18.023 --> 01:59:20.965]  And I tell people the only thing I did was X2 iodine.
[01:59:21.385 --> 01:59:22.006]  We're good to go.
[01:59:50.672 --> 01:59:56.595]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:01.638 --> 02:00:08.122]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:11.786 --> 02:00:12.426]  History.
[02:00:12.926 --> 02:00:22.350]  Apparently, their definition of transparency is that if you ask any questions about the election, then you'll be taken to court for billions of dollars and slapped with federal indictments.
[02:00:23.190 --> 02:00:25.832]  Other than that, yeah, totally transparent.
[02:00:27.032 --> 02:00:40.878]  It's this kind of transparency that led us to the discovery that back in October of 2020, just before the elections, mind you, some eight to ten thousand suspected fraudulent voter registrations were dumped at a small city in western Michigan.
[02:00:41.659 --> 02:00:52.944]  Far left State Attorney General Dana Nessel, the same one who last year called for drag queens at every elementary school, has confirmed this case is so serious it was actually referred to the FBI.
[02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:58.441]  Now we know that's where we'll stop, but the fact that it made it that far is interesting.
[02:00:59.622 --> 02:01:08.624]  So what apparently happened is that a Muskegon City clerk discovered a black one, dropping off thousands of these completed voter registration forms.
[02:01:09.244 --> 02:01:18.707]  According to reports from the Gateway Pundit and the Detroit News, these applications all had the exact same handwriting, used addresses that didn't exist,
[02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:29.853]  The clerk reported the woman, and an investigation later found she worked for a group called GBI Strategies.
[02:01:30.553 --> 02:01:40.238]  This firm was funded by a dark money super PAC, ironically called BlackPAC, which paid GBI over $11 million to register voters for Joe Biden.
[02:01:40.758 --> 02:01:50.162]  It gets weirder, though, because this group, GBI Strategies, was operating at an old eyeglass store, and when the police showed up, what they found was like something outlandish.
[02:01:53.268 --> 02:01:53.848]  We're good to go.
[02:02:16.414 --> 02:02:27.677]  Responding to this, the Attorney General's office, probably for the first time in history, defended the find by claiming that all these terrifying weapons of war were registered and known legally.
[02:02:27.697 --> 02:02:31.677]  I mean, who doesn't take automatic rifles to work with them at the office?
[02:02:32.118 --> 02:02:32.878]  And silencers?
[02:02:33.278 --> 02:02:34.598]  Come on, guns are loud.
[02:02:34.838 --> 02:02:35.898]  They need to be quieter.
[02:02:36.158 --> 02:02:37.159]  That's perfectly normal.
[02:02:37.179 --> 02:02:38.239]  Don't be so paranoid.
[02:02:38.259 --> 02:02:42.860]  There were also apparently several whiteboards
[02:02:45.169 --> 02:02:51.451]  One of them was written, Hot Topics, which listed weapons in the field prepared for shifts.
[02:02:53.391 --> 02:02:55.612]  None of this is ominous at all.
[02:02:56.992 --> 02:03:01.833]  During their investigation, police also discovered temporary businesses where the registrations were being stored.
[02:03:02.253 --> 02:03:12.396]  And it turns out, the Democrat firm wasn't just filling out fake voter registrations, they were actually shipping entire packages of these registrations off to other communities.
[02:03:15.179 --> 02:03:22.409]  Lieutenant Michael Anderson said it's totally unexpected to find weapons and silencers in a normal business.
[02:03:23.190 --> 02:03:28.577]  And it's a lot easier to hide information when you use prepaid cash cards to pay employees.
[02:03:29.648 --> 02:03:37.654]  Authorities are still investigating, but this appears to be nothing less than industrialized voter fraud, organized and sanctioned by the Democrat Party.
[02:03:38.414 --> 02:03:51.184]  Astonishingly, or perhaps not, the director of GBI Strategies, Gary Bell, actually brags about operating similar organizations in at least 20 states, including all of the key battleground states.
[02:03:52.403 --> 02:03:54.544]  So we know this isn't an isolated event.
[02:03:54.664 --> 02:03:59.507]  The Democrats are manufacturing voting fraud on a national scale.
[02:04:00.487 --> 02:04:05.650]  Now this investigation has been covered up and buried by politicians and the mainstream media for obvious reasons.
[02:04:06.110 --> 02:04:11.693]  And after being turned over to the FBI, run by Christopher Wray, it was apparently left to die.
[02:04:12.867 --> 02:04:24.613]  Michigan State Senator Ruth Johnson, former Secretary of State, told the Gateway Pundit she estimated as many as 800,000 ballot applications were sent to non-qualified voters in Michigan.
[02:04:25.453 --> 02:04:30.175]  That's well over the roughly 150,000 votes Joe Biden was awarded.
[02:04:30.896 --> 02:04:36.978]  More than enough to overturn the election and give President Trump a victory in Michigan.
[02:04:38.239 --> 02:04:40.920]  For One America News, I'm Pearson Sharp.
[02:04:46.216 --> 02:04:52.160]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are in existence.
[02:04:52.541 --> 02:04:53.821]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:04:58.445 --> 02:05:01.967]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[02:05:02.347 --> 02:05:09.372]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of, is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[02:05:09.552 --> 02:05:11.554]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[02:05:11.734 --> 02:05:12.794]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[02:05:12.814 --> 02:05:13.515]  He loved the idea.
[02:05:13.855 --> 02:05:17.359]  What would you call the debate and discussion about a pro-human future?
[02:05:17.399 --> 02:05:18.281]  Just Team Humanity?
[02:05:18.341 --> 02:05:19.222]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[02:05:19.362 --> 02:05:19.822]  Absolutely.
[02:05:20.143 --> 02:05:21.524]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[02:05:21.604 --> 02:05:25.029]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[02:05:25.269 --> 02:05:32.718]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to give Infowars on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[02:05:32.978 --> 02:05:44.707]  I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand that this is a revolution against the globalists and it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[02:05:44.987 --> 02:05:46.308]  We're told humans are the problem.
[02:05:46.328 --> 02:05:47.309]  We're told we're killing the Earth.
[02:05:47.589 --> 02:05:51.852]  We're told all this garbage so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[02:05:52.153 --> 02:05:52.873]  We're not going to do that.
[02:05:53.113 --> 02:05:57.757]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[02:06:02.017 --> 02:06:02.898]  You found it.
[02:06:03.238 --> 02:06:04.760]  The tip of the spear.
[02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:07.682]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:10.825 --> 02:06:15.149]  Look, I'm going to be just completely frank with the listeners.
[02:06:15.189 --> 02:06:19.814]  I say a lot of things about myself here on air that are bad.
[02:06:20.374 --> 02:06:22.576]  And I do it because honesty is the best policy.
[02:06:23.798 --> 02:06:25.699]  And admitting our faults is...
[02:06:26.994 --> 02:06:27.835]  Really what it's all about.
[02:06:27.875 --> 02:06:31.917]  And you're going to hear me say this, and you're going to say, well, that's not that bad a thing, or that's not bad.
[02:06:31.937 --> 02:06:33.098]  Yeah, it is.
[02:06:34.419 --> 02:06:34.859]  Yeah, it is.
[02:06:35.159 --> 02:06:50.990]  So, during the break, while I was eating a quick bite of lunch and talking to my middle daughter, got three great daughters, great son, I was walking back to the studio, and I just thought about, what am I supposed to say right now?
[02:06:51.010 --> 02:06:56.514]  You know, I've got all this news, all this information in front of me,
[02:06:57.790 --> 02:06:58.971]  But I'm not just here to cover news.
[02:06:59.011 --> 02:07:00.531]  I'm here to really talk about the heart of the matter.
[02:07:01.892 --> 02:07:03.232]  And I thought, well, just look in the mirror.
[02:07:05.614 --> 02:07:08.895]  And, you know, a thought is hard to quantify.
[02:07:08.975 --> 02:07:10.676]  I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.
[02:07:10.696 --> 02:07:16.378]  A thought is so complex, so deep, connected to so many things, and you're like, how do you say this?
[02:07:16.578 --> 02:07:21.841]  And so I was sitting here as the music started with Jimi Hendrix singing, thinking, how do I explain this?
[02:07:22.521 --> 02:07:24.002]  And I thought, well, maybe you shouldn't even say it.
[02:07:24.781 --> 02:07:25.302]  I'm like, no.
[02:07:25.922 --> 02:07:26.543]  It's not even that.
[02:07:26.563 --> 02:07:31.968]  I mean, it's huge, but it's simple at the same time, but also super deep, like anything complex.
[02:07:37.674 --> 02:07:38.555]  Here's the best way to say it.
[02:07:39.156 --> 02:07:40.297]  We've already been conquered.
[02:07:41.478 --> 02:07:42.960]  Let's stop lying to ourselves.
[02:07:43.160 --> 02:07:44.181]  We're not in a war.
[02:07:44.241 --> 02:07:44.922]  We lost the war.
[02:07:46.718 --> 02:07:52.562]  But if you're occupied by enemy power, the first thing you've got to do is admit you're occupied.
[02:07:53.063 --> 02:07:55.745]  So I don't say that to demoralize you or make you depressed.
[02:07:56.445 --> 02:08:02.670]  I say it because let's just admit we've been trained to put up with outrageous garbage.
[02:08:02.690 --> 02:08:04.692]  I have another word for it.
[02:08:05.892 --> 02:08:07.634]  I'm not going to say it on the radio or on TV.
[02:08:08.995 --> 02:08:13.678]  So... I'm trying to explain this.
[02:08:14.099 --> 02:08:14.239]  It's...
[02:08:15.646 --> 02:08:16.686]  You know what I'm talking about.
[02:08:16.706 --> 02:08:20.548]  It's a sense of guilt that we've let it go this far.
[02:08:21.528 --> 02:08:30.170]  And that it's kind of sick if I just sit here and chronicle this like I'm doing a voiceover to a snuff film.
[02:08:32.031 --> 02:08:37.013]  I'm not doing this to just sit here and fear porn, cover the latest new and older developments.
[02:08:37.213 --> 02:08:38.273]  I really want to stop this.
[02:08:40.714 --> 02:08:41.494]  And to do that...
[02:08:42.813 --> 02:08:43.233]  No, I don't.
[02:09:12.671 --> 02:09:13.911]  I mean, that's what happened in the first hour.
[02:09:38.072 --> 02:09:39.353]  And show how stupid the left is.
[02:09:39.793 --> 02:09:43.274]  The left are people that fell to the enemy brainwashing and programming.
[02:09:43.455 --> 02:09:44.915]  They're people we lost.
[02:09:46.216 --> 02:09:49.678]  And I'm as guilty as anybody or worse at making fun of the left.
[02:09:49.898 --> 02:09:50.638]  They're nasty.
[02:09:50.678 --> 02:09:51.418]  They're stupid.
[02:09:51.618 --> 02:09:52.379]  They're ignorant.
[02:09:52.419 --> 02:09:53.139]  They're arrogant.
[02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:55.080]  I can't stand them.
[02:09:57.001 --> 02:10:00.663]  But they're people we lost, folks.
[02:10:01.183 --> 02:10:03.064]  And now they've been turned into zombies against us.
[02:10:04.448 --> 02:10:09.652]  So you may look at a big, giant horde of zombies and look how dumb they are and say, look how dumb those zombies are.
[02:10:09.873 --> 02:10:10.473]  Well, guess what?
[02:10:10.653 --> 02:10:12.014]  A thousand of them will eat your ass.
[02:10:14.196 --> 02:10:18.720]  And so I'm trying to quantify what I'm saying in some simple statement, but I think you get what I'm saying.
[02:10:19.941 --> 02:10:26.207]  I think we have to really just sit back and assess the fact that we're deep into the tyranny.
[02:10:27.065 --> 02:10:34.953]  I mean, my God, all the censorship, all the debanking, all the persecution, all the lies about us, all the things they've done to us.
[02:10:37.116 --> 02:10:40.559]  Conservatives and Christians and populists and capitalists are not like the left.
[02:10:40.599 --> 02:10:45.644]  We don't live in a world of being victims and whining, but they use our strength against us.
[02:10:46.044 --> 02:10:57.755]  We should all be beyond pissed off what they've done and not sit there and live in victimhood, but make our entire focus on exposing these people any way we can and not complying.
[02:10:58.636 --> 02:11:00.278]  And when we start acting like that,
[02:11:02.756 --> 02:11:03.436]  We're going to beat this.
[02:11:03.917 --> 02:11:11.222]  That's all I'm saying is, when I say something to you, I'm talking to myself like I'm in the shower or walking down the park by myself.
[02:11:11.262 --> 02:11:16.526]  You're not even talking out loud, but you're kind of talking to yourself about problems in life or issues or things.
[02:11:16.826 --> 02:11:18.447]  You have an internal dialogue going on.
[02:11:18.868 --> 02:11:23.091]  And my internal dialogue is like, we've got to bring it, man.
[02:11:24.051 --> 02:11:26.313]  And then I get frustrated and I say, how do we bring it?
[02:11:27.915 --> 02:11:28.335]  So I get it.
[02:11:28.355 --> 02:11:32.038]  We're looking at this big, frustrating, out-of-control-growing cancer.
[02:11:32.679 --> 02:11:34.320]  And we're going to be upset.
[02:11:35.581 --> 02:11:36.401]  And that's natural.
[02:11:36.462 --> 02:11:42.506]  But I look at the smiley-faced neocons like Bill Kristol calling for Tucker Carlson to be basically put in jail.
[02:11:43.807 --> 02:11:46.389]  And him being put on the hit list by the Ukrainian terrorists.
[02:11:47.930 --> 02:11:49.972]  And I just see all this crap we put up with.
[02:11:51.213 --> 02:11:54.075]  And I guess to quantify it, I'm just saying...
[02:11:59.957 --> 02:12:01.298]  I don't guess it goes back to God.
[02:12:01.318 --> 02:12:01.839]  It goes back to God.
[02:12:26.112 --> 02:12:26.672]  We're good to go.
[02:12:50.509 --> 02:12:52.571]  We're the new world order at some point in the last two years.
[02:12:52.971 --> 02:13:00.317]  And you can feel it, you can see it, and there's all these holier-than-thou people that want to sit back and talk about how the strong man stumbled.
[02:13:00.337 --> 02:13:19.112]  But if we're not ready to have victory, if we're not ready promoting our vision of civilization and success and prosperity and security, and we're just used to thinking of the enemy as always being in charge and the establishment, then we're going to lose their illegitimate...
[02:13:21.667 --> 02:13:22.567]  They're frauds.
[02:13:25.028 --> 02:13:33.330]  And you have to decide that you don't care what they say or what they do or what they do to you.
[02:13:33.790 --> 02:13:36.931]  You have to make the decision to survive.
[02:13:37.511 --> 02:13:39.892]  You have to make the decision to resist.
[02:13:40.332 --> 02:13:43.233]  You have to make the decision to thrive and be strong enough
[02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:45.020]  And do it.
[02:13:45.900 --> 02:13:57.742]  And then just thank God and your lucky stars every day that you're not a sack of pedophile garbage like Joe Biden or the Pope.
[02:13:59.203 --> 02:14:05.284]  And when I say the Pope, Catholics are under globalist attack because they actually are still trying to follow God.
[02:14:05.524 --> 02:14:07.004]  But they seized our leaders, folks.
[02:14:07.264 --> 02:14:08.684]  Joe Biden's not the president.
[02:14:11.145 --> 02:14:12.465]  The Pope's not the Pope.
[02:14:15.396 --> 02:14:17.496]  All of our institutions have been seized.
[02:14:19.477 --> 02:14:21.337]  The Boy Scouts got taken over by pedophiles.
[02:14:23.918 --> 02:14:31.799]  The public schools, almost everything has been seized and they don't have the authority over us.
[02:14:32.099 --> 02:14:33.359]  They are illegitimate.
[02:14:33.739 --> 02:14:37.240]  And that doesn't mean we go out and shoot them because that will turn them into victims.
[02:14:37.300 --> 02:14:38.740]  We shoot their ideas.
[02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:42.141]  We non-violently, politically decapitate their frauds.
[02:14:43.321 --> 02:14:44.021]  That's kind of a
[02:14:46.764 --> 02:14:50.386]  Multi-direction rant there, but that's just what's in my mind.
[02:14:50.466 --> 02:14:54.649]  It's just the sitting back and watching this.
[02:14:55.990 --> 02:15:00.593]  I feel guilty, actually, even watching it and chronicling it.
[02:15:01.293 --> 02:15:02.114]  See, I have a conscience.
[02:15:04.115 --> 02:15:04.956]  The globalists don't.
[02:15:08.958 --> 02:15:09.418]  They love it.
[02:15:11.199 --> 02:15:12.240]  They don't have any morals.
[02:15:13.241 --> 02:15:14.982]  To them, being moral is hurting children.
[02:15:16.733 --> 02:15:24.399]  And the answer here is just giving them absolutely zero support and withdrawing all contact with the system.
[02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:34.106]  And you're going to find there's all these great organizations and churches and groups and companies and systems and banks that aren't the enemy.
[02:15:34.126 --> 02:15:38.590]  And that's why the enemy's racing with BlackRock and their pedophile god, Larry Fink.
[02:15:41.312 --> 02:15:44.214]  He may not rape kids personally, but he funds the pedophile propaganda.
[02:15:46.567 --> 02:15:52.299]  And we have to know that they've got to be defeated because God's watching.
[02:15:53.522 --> 02:15:55.626]  All right, we've got Drew Hernandez coming up with big breaking news.
[02:15:57.855 --> 02:16:02.138]  29 years on air, all I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalists.
[02:16:02.838 --> 02:16:08.161]  And I've done the best job I can to tell the truth and the inaccurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[02:16:08.561 --> 02:16:15.005]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves, unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people.
[02:16:15.245 --> 02:16:15.926]  We don't do that.
[02:16:16.386 --> 02:16:18.267]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[02:16:18.647 --> 02:16:20.668]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product.
[02:16:20.708 --> 02:16:21.289]  It's so powerful.
[02:16:22.209 --> 02:16:32.273]  This is the breakdown product after your cells process it of folic acid, methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[02:16:32.733 --> 02:16:33.954]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[02:16:33.994 --> 02:16:34.854]  It's not a stimulant.
[02:16:35.114 --> 02:16:36.915]  It energizes your cells.
[02:16:37.495 --> 02:16:40.019]  And that everything else you take just supercharges it.
[02:16:40.039 --> 02:16:40.880]  It's so insane.
[02:16:41.220 --> 02:16:42.722]  It's foundational energy.
[02:16:43.203 --> 02:16:47.328]  The strongest formula out there at infowarsstore.com.
[02:16:47.729 --> 02:16:50.573]  It doesn't just energize this operation against the tyrants.
[02:16:50.653 --> 02:16:51.774]  It energizes you.
[02:16:52.055 --> 02:16:53.477]  Get foundational energy now.
[02:16:57.358 --> 02:16:58.619]  Bodies is back.
[02:16:58.759 --> 02:17:05.805]  The ultimate turmeric product on the market has returned to InfoWarsStore.com and is now 25% off for a limited time.
[02:17:06.166 --> 02:17:11.170]  Utilized for thousands of years, turmeric is one of the most studied medicinal herbs today.
[02:17:11.550 --> 02:17:19.197]  Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles are published every year on the chemistry and therapeutic potential of turmeric and its active components.
[02:17:19.497 --> 02:17:30.044]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body, help boost and support flexibility, increase mobility, assist in joint function, bolster your immune system, and so much more.
[02:17:30.404 --> 02:17:42.152]  Regular turmeric from the store contains about 1-5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids, but our super powerful extract used in bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients in turmeric.
[02:17:42.392 --> 02:17:43.653]  If you ever take one piece of my advice...
[02:18:01.667 --> 02:18:02.868]  It's get a bottle of X2.
[02:18:03.629 --> 02:18:07.913]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[02:18:08.313 --> 02:18:12.777]  We finally have a limited run back in supply at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:18:14.138 --> 02:18:16.880]  So many people have serious issues.
[02:18:17.181 --> 02:18:18.302]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[02:18:18.762 --> 02:18:24.167]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[02:18:24.707 --> 02:18:27.089]  Most of their iodine is bound to other heavy metals or...
[02:18:27.810 --> 02:18:28.290]  We're good to go.
[02:18:57.188 --> 02:18:57.568]  We're good to go.
[02:18:57.588 --> 02:18:58.129]  We're good to go.
[02:19:16.877 --> 02:19:17.437]  We're good to go.
[02:19:39.403 --> 02:19:47.467]  Do a deep dive, research the possibilities of colloidal silver yourself, and don't miss out on this limited-time offer of $10 off.
[02:19:47.627 --> 02:19:56.051]  Try InfoWars Life Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver today, available right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:19:59.752 --> 02:20:05.635]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:09.210 --> 02:20:09.772]  We're good to go.
[02:20:15.450 --> 02:20:16.451]  Yeah, we're a Christian, right?
[02:20:16.871 --> 02:20:17.392]  I'm a Christian.
[02:20:17.452 --> 02:20:20.314]  If you could stand your ground as a Christian... I'm a Christian too, sir.
[02:20:20.334 --> 02:20:23.076]  So how can you justify breaking the law on a daily basis?
[02:20:23.116 --> 02:20:24.598]  This is not your country.
[02:20:24.618 --> 02:20:25.518]  You think this is your country?
[02:20:25.538 --> 02:20:26.279]  Yes, I'm an American.
[02:20:26.299 --> 02:20:27.020]  This is my country.
[02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:27.480]  America.
[02:20:27.500 --> 02:20:28.201]  This is a Mexican.
[02:20:28.221 --> 02:20:29.722]  This is a Mexican territory.
[02:20:29.742 --> 02:20:30.663]  So you're a Christian, right?
[02:20:30.683 --> 02:20:30.903]  So what?
[02:20:30.963 --> 02:20:32.064]  Are you a Christian?
[02:20:32.084 --> 02:20:32.424]  So what?
[02:20:32.524 --> 02:20:33.485]  What's that got to do with this?
[02:20:33.505 --> 02:20:34.126]  So now you're testing me out.
[02:20:34.146 --> 02:20:35.066]  What's that got to do with this?
[02:20:35.106 --> 02:20:36.347]  What country are you from?
[02:20:36.367 --> 02:20:36.928]  What do you care?
[02:20:37.348 --> 02:20:38.369]  Because this is my country.
[02:20:38.529 --> 02:20:39.610]  This is my country too.
[02:20:39.710 --> 02:20:40.491]  No, I'm an American.
[02:20:41.107 --> 02:20:42.168]  I'm an American too.
[02:20:42.188 --> 02:20:43.468]  I'm an American too.
[02:20:43.608 --> 02:20:44.308]  Are you an American?
[02:20:44.569 --> 02:20:47.250]  What city are you from?
[02:20:47.310 --> 02:20:48.390]  This is my business.
[02:20:48.870 --> 02:20:50.131]  Because this is illegal right here.
[02:20:50.151 --> 02:20:52.472]  You guys are aiding and abetting a human trafficking operation.
[02:20:52.492 --> 02:20:54.553]  You're claiming to be Christian, doing it in the name of God.
[02:20:55.313 --> 02:20:59.575]  So why are you facilitating and encouraging illegal immigration, breaking the law?
[02:20:59.735 --> 02:21:02.076]  Are you doing it in the name of Jesus?
[02:21:02.136 --> 02:21:05.978]  You claim to be doing the work of Jesus Christ, but Jesus Christ is not about lawlessness.
[02:21:06.704 --> 02:21:07.544]  You're right.
[02:21:08.024 --> 02:21:11.925]  So why are you operating in a capacity where this is a lawless operation?
[02:21:11.985 --> 02:21:13.806]  You want to get our mineral pay or something?
[02:21:13.886 --> 02:21:14.486]  Is that what it is?
[02:21:14.526 --> 02:21:15.006]  No, no, no.
[02:21:15.046 --> 02:21:15.566]  You want pay?
[02:21:15.626 --> 02:21:16.786]  No, I want my country to be secure.
[02:21:16.806 --> 02:21:18.887]  You want to say that you confront us and you got away with it?
[02:21:18.907 --> 02:21:20.387]  No, I want my country to be secure.
[02:21:20.407 --> 02:21:23.748]  And if you are here illegally, I want you to come legally.
[02:21:24.168 --> 02:21:25.048]  It's not illegally.
[02:21:25.248 --> 02:21:27.188]  Okay, this is an illegal operation.
[02:21:27.548 --> 02:21:28.789]  No, this is a country.
[02:21:28.909 --> 02:21:29.949]  We have laws, sir.
[02:21:30.469 --> 02:21:32.009]  You have to abide by our laws.
[02:21:32.629 --> 02:21:35.010]  And if you're not going to abide by our laws, you don't belong here.
[02:21:36.027 --> 02:21:38.289]  This is an entire operation that's illegal.
[02:21:38.730 --> 02:21:40.792]  It's human trafficking, aiding and abetting.
[02:21:40.812 --> 02:21:41.772]  You know what?
[02:21:41.793 --> 02:21:43.754]  Go find somebody who cares about your stuff.
[02:21:43.834 --> 02:21:44.455]  America cares.
[02:21:44.515 --> 02:21:44.996]  We don't care.
[02:21:45.036 --> 02:21:46.437]  He's looking at that camera.
[02:21:46.477 --> 02:21:47.518]  America cares, sir.
[02:21:47.718 --> 02:21:49.179]  Go find somebody who cares.
[02:21:49.460 --> 02:21:50.281]  America cares.
[02:21:50.321 --> 02:21:50.841]  You know what?
[02:21:50.941 --> 02:21:53.403]  When you want to fight, when you want to fight somebody, go find somebody.
[02:21:53.443 --> 02:21:55.886]  You're the one getting violent here, sir.
[02:21:55.946 --> 02:21:57.267]  Somebody that can defend themselves.
[02:21:57.287 --> 02:21:58.448]  You're the one getting violent.
[02:21:58.769 --> 02:21:59.309]  You're the one...
[02:22:00.470 --> 02:22:01.171]  You gotta calm down.
[02:22:01.631 --> 02:22:01.831]  Alright?
[02:22:01.871 --> 02:22:02.572]  You gotta calm down.
[02:22:02.592 --> 02:22:03.952]  You're not gonna tell me what to do.
[02:22:03.972 --> 02:22:05.053]  You're not gonna tell me what to do.
[02:22:05.073 --> 02:22:05.754]  This is my country.
[02:22:05.774 --> 02:22:06.514]  You're not gonna tell me what to do.
[02:22:06.534 --> 02:22:07.235]  This is my country too.
[02:22:07.255 --> 02:22:07.775]  I'm an American.
[02:22:07.835 --> 02:22:08.496]  No, this is my country.
[02:22:08.516 --> 02:22:09.416]  This is my country too.
[02:22:09.596 --> 02:22:11.137]  You won't even tell me if you're a citizen or not.
[02:22:11.157 --> 02:22:12.018]  You won't provide.
[02:22:12.238 --> 02:22:12.558]  Why?
[02:22:12.578 --> 02:22:12.638]  Why?
[02:22:12.658 --> 02:22:12.919]  Because.
[02:22:12.939 --> 02:22:14.019]  That's your authority.
[02:22:14.039 --> 02:22:15.180]  I just told you.
[02:22:15.720 --> 02:22:17.061]  You don't have any authority.
[02:22:17.101 --> 02:22:18.703]  Yeah, I'm just asking you a question.
[02:22:19.623 --> 02:22:20.504]  Do I have to answer?
[02:22:20.524 --> 02:22:21.444]  You want to know what my authority is?
[02:22:21.464 --> 02:22:22.225]  Do I have to answer?
[02:22:22.405 --> 02:22:23.646]  You want to know what my authority is?
[02:22:23.966 --> 02:22:25.847]  This is an illegal human trafficking operation.
[02:22:25.927 --> 02:22:29.350]  And I want to know if you're an American participating in it or not.
[02:22:31.874 --> 02:22:37.635]  That's Drew Hernandez on the California-Mexico border in the dead of night, alone, confronting smugglers.
[02:22:38.155 --> 02:22:40.135]  There's hours of this bombshell footage.
[02:22:41.056 --> 02:22:45.136]  He's posted on his ex-account, and we've been relinking to the real Alex Jones.
[02:22:45.156 --> 02:22:46.537]  He joins us coming up in the next segment.
[02:22:48.337 --> 02:23:00.299]  And the arrogance that goes on against this country, where America is seen as a doormat, and then they smuggle these people and use them for slave labor and use them for sex slavery...
[02:23:01.323 --> 02:23:03.064]  We're good to go.
[02:23:03.084 --> 02:23:04.184]  We're good to go.
[02:23:04.204 --> 02:23:04.664]  We're good to go.
[02:23:29.804 --> 02:23:39.387]  But oh, they're anti-racist, so it's okay to bring in the brown kids and use them as slaves after they shut down Latin America with the COVID lockdowns.
[02:23:40.448 --> 02:23:47.350]  And I've got all these new clips of John Kerry and Tedros saying food is the problem.
[02:23:49.411 --> 02:23:51.631]  We must cut the food off to save the world.
[02:23:51.751 --> 02:23:53.452]  We will starve if we don't cut the food off.
[02:23:54.690 --> 02:23:57.111]  We must run the fuel out of your gas tank.
[02:23:57.411 --> 02:24:00.953]  You must let your gas tank go to empty or your car will run out of gas.
[02:24:02.274 --> 02:24:04.595]  You must shoot yourself in the head or you will bleed to death.
[02:24:04.615 --> 02:24:06.516]  I have another clip.
[02:24:06.836 --> 02:24:08.797]  I know this wasn't in the list, but it was on my ex-account.
[02:24:09.557 --> 02:24:10.498]  I retweeted it yesterday.
[02:24:10.978 --> 02:24:14.720]  Tedros talked about the epidemic of genital mutilation.
[02:24:14.760 --> 02:24:16.061]  He didn't say it was Muslims doing it.
[02:24:16.421 --> 02:24:17.061]  That's who's doing it.
[02:24:17.321 --> 02:24:22.564]  But millions of little girls a year have their clitoris cut off.
[02:24:25.219 --> 02:24:26.059]  And he's against that.
[02:24:26.660 --> 02:24:27.420]  I'm against it too.
[02:24:29.101 --> 02:24:30.642]  But the commenters were like, well, wait a minute.
[02:24:30.982 --> 02:24:34.283]  But we're cutting little boys' genitals off and little girls' breasts off.
[02:24:34.623 --> 02:24:36.624]  But that's the medical system, so that's okay.
[02:24:36.644 --> 02:24:37.505]  I'll give it to the Muslims.
[02:24:38.825 --> 02:24:44.048]  Cutting a girl's clitoris off is abusive and maims her for life and all the rest of it.
[02:24:44.928 --> 02:24:47.729]  But they're not cutting the whole thing out.
[02:24:49.830 --> 02:24:51.051]  They're not cutting her breast off.
[02:24:53.263 --> 02:24:58.968]  So the Muslims, on the scale of evil, of 1 to 10, on mutilating children, are like a 5.
[02:25:01.210 --> 02:25:02.892]  And the Western system's a 10.
[02:25:05.294 --> 02:25:06.475]  So imagine, your daughter's born.
[02:25:06.495 --> 02:25:12.040]  I hate to be gross here, folks, but God gave that to the women for enjoyment with her husband.
[02:25:12.480 --> 02:25:14.782]  It's a part of having fun.
[02:25:15.283 --> 02:25:16.444]  God wants us to have children.
[02:25:16.524 --> 02:25:17.265]  God designed us.
[02:25:18.533 --> 02:25:23.614]  And the Muslims for a thousand years cut their daughters' clitorises off.
[02:25:24.754 --> 02:25:25.034]  All right?
[02:25:25.234 --> 02:25:27.535]  You can say, well, the Jews cut the foreskin off the penis.
[02:25:27.955 --> 02:25:28.515]  How about this?
[02:25:28.735 --> 02:25:30.595]  How about we stop cutting kids' junk off?
[02:25:31.775 --> 02:25:32.575]  God gave it to us.
[02:25:32.615 --> 02:25:33.236]  Let's leave it on.
[02:25:35.436 --> 02:25:35.876]  I hear you.
[02:25:36.316 --> 02:25:40.277]  A baby can't decide whether he wants his foreskin cut off, and so it's wrong.
[02:25:44.498 --> 02:25:45.458]  But it's ritual abuse.
[02:25:45.538 --> 02:25:47.018]  Well, you know, I want it to look like mine.
[02:25:54.929 --> 02:25:58.291]  Is it wrong to pull one child's tooth out that's healthy?
[02:25:58.311 --> 02:25:58.511]  Yeah.
[02:25:58.591 --> 02:25:59.811]  Is it wrong to pull them all out?
[02:25:59.851 --> 02:26:00.072]  Yeah.
[02:26:00.092 --> 02:26:00.132]  So...
[02:26:24.179 --> 02:26:33.245]  And look, I don't want to get up here and talk about this sickness, but where does it come from to chop little boys' penises up?
[02:26:33.725 --> 02:26:34.786]  Where is the obsession?
[02:26:37.547 --> 02:26:38.408]  The Jews are doing it.
[02:26:39.829 --> 02:26:40.829]  The Muslims are doing it.
[02:26:42.110 --> 02:26:43.131]  The Christians are doing it.
[02:26:46.073 --> 02:26:47.834]  There's weird tribes in Africa doing it.
[02:26:48.394 --> 02:26:49.215]  There's weird stuff.
[02:26:49.455 --> 02:26:52.797]  Every culture gets in a position where they start
[02:26:54.028 --> 02:26:56.471]  Chopping up body parts on people's genitals.
[02:26:57.472 --> 02:26:59.494]  How about hands off our children's genitals?
[02:26:59.854 --> 02:27:09.604]  Remember the Surgeon General nominee of Clinton's went on television and said, I want to teach teachers to masturbate one-year-olds.
[02:27:09.984 --> 02:27:11.706]  Reach down and do it for them.
[02:27:11.726 --> 02:27:12.366]  That's what she talked.
[02:27:12.947 --> 02:27:14.609]  Help them masturbate.
[02:27:15.794 --> 02:27:17.334]  You're like, oh, what a sick, evil woman.
[02:27:17.754 --> 02:27:19.755]  Hell, she just wanted to have the kids masturbate.
[02:27:19.775 --> 02:27:24.496]  That's bad enough to have some teacher grabbing your kids' genitals?
[02:27:24.536 --> 02:27:24.936]  What the?
[02:27:25.256 --> 02:27:28.137]  That's pedophilia, okay?
[02:27:29.037 --> 02:27:31.998]  And so that's a 10 on a scale, but now the scale goes to 100.
[02:27:32.038 --> 02:27:41.680]  Because I'm not lessening that, but I mean, I'll tell you, fiddling with it, what's that compared to chopping it off?
[02:27:43.476 --> 02:27:48.142]  You say, what is this satanic obsession with our reproduction?
[02:27:49.264 --> 02:27:51.766]  Because the devil wants to kill humans.
[02:27:52.106 --> 02:27:52.947]  Kill, steal, and destroy.
[02:27:53.207 --> 02:27:54.928]  The devil doesn't want us to have children.
[02:27:55.168 --> 02:27:56.589]  The devil doesn't want us to have families.
[02:27:56.849 --> 02:28:00.492]  The devil doesn't want men and women married to have enjoyment together.
[02:28:00.712 --> 02:28:05.155]  Oh, God gave us these bodies and sex and life and all this.
[02:28:05.175 --> 02:28:06.115]  That didn't come from the devil.
[02:28:06.356 --> 02:28:08.117]  The devil always sells his stuff with sex.
[02:28:08.757 --> 02:28:10.218]  An abomination of sex.
[02:28:11.199 --> 02:28:12.580]  A distortion of sex.
[02:28:13.440 --> 02:28:15.342]  Not the real thing it's supposed to be.
[02:28:17.159 --> 02:28:21.524]  We'll talk to Drew Hernandez, great reporter for InfoWars, also really smart pastor.
[02:28:22.325 --> 02:28:25.549]  On the ground, he's been knocking it out of the park when we come back.
[02:28:26.510 --> 02:28:29.895]  And then, who's on the fourth hour here?
[02:28:30.656 --> 02:28:33.119]  Oh, the mighty, always informative.
[02:28:33.159 --> 02:28:34.440]  Boy, he does his research.
[02:28:35.121 --> 02:28:36.322]  Jason Burmess.
[02:28:37.441 --> 02:28:39.223]  And then Owen Schroyer, 3 p.m.
[02:28:39.303 --> 02:28:41.626]  Central today, The War Room.
[02:28:41.946 --> 02:28:54.501]  And whatever time, Tucker, since there's different numbers put out, whether it's 6 or 7 Central, whatever it is, we'll be here tomorrow covering the Putin interview, live on air, InfoWars.com.
[02:28:59.468 --> 02:29:00.708]  Gunther in Tennessee.
[02:29:00.749 --> 02:29:01.729]  Thanks for calling, Gunther.
[02:29:01.749 --> 02:29:02.309]  Hey, Alex.
[02:29:02.489 --> 02:29:03.229]  First time caller.
[02:29:03.330 --> 02:29:05.170]  Real quick, wanted to plug your foundational energy.
[02:29:05.730 --> 02:29:06.691]  Just started taking that.
[02:29:07.351 --> 02:29:10.432]  And, boy, three pills, recommended dose.
[02:29:10.512 --> 02:29:11.653]  I was bouncing off the walls.
[02:29:11.773 --> 02:29:17.395]  But I tell you, foundational is the right name for that product because I've cut down to one.
[02:29:18.275 --> 02:29:22.277]  It's like you have a baseline of energy that you were missing before that you got back.
[02:29:22.397 --> 02:29:22.477]  So,
[02:29:22.657 --> 02:29:30.923]  Well, I'm glad you mentioned that because it's methylfolate, the breakdown of folic acid, and a lot of people, particularly Europeans, don't absorb all of the folic acid.
[02:29:31.183 --> 02:29:32.264]  So it's not a stimulant.
[02:29:32.484 --> 02:29:35.906]  It's a totally natural thing that boosts energy that's foundational.
[02:29:36.186 --> 02:29:38.748]  And was I lying to you or did it not work?
[02:29:39.429 --> 02:29:40.649]  No, it was top-notch.
[02:29:40.689 --> 02:29:44.312]  And I was actually taking Red Pill Plus before, and that's got a little folic acid in it.
[02:29:44.352 --> 02:29:48.155]  I think there was a little buildup from this, but the energy from this was no jitters.
[02:29:48.335 --> 02:29:49.255]  I mean, it's top-notch.
[02:29:49.335 --> 02:29:50.076]  It's a great product.
[02:29:50.492 --> 02:29:51.434]  Well, thank you so much.
[02:29:51.474 --> 02:29:51.814]  Yeah, no.
[02:29:51.894 --> 02:29:55.240]  Folic acid's great and it's in real red pill, but some can't break it down.
[02:29:55.280 --> 02:29:56.281]  This is the breakdown of it.
[02:29:56.362 --> 02:29:57.123]  That's exactly it.
[02:29:58.145 --> 02:30:04.475]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the globalist agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[02:30:05.840 --> 02:30:18.813]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections, masquerading as vaccines.
[02:30:18.954 --> 02:30:27.983]  It is so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives oblivious, and you realize ignorance is not bliss, it equals death.
[02:30:29.602 --> 02:30:50.049]  But people are starting to really understand how serious things are, and that's a hard thing to do, because to wake up to a disturbing reality and realize that we're in the middle of a giant biological weapons war against humanity, and that there's mass sterilization that's already taking place, cutting off all the major energy sources, is really hard to deal with, but it's the reality.
[02:30:50.589 --> 02:30:54.770]  Facing it is our only chance to turn this around, because stuff's about to get really, really nasty.
[02:30:55.191 --> 02:30:55.811]  Infowars.com.
[02:30:57.731 --> 02:31:00.034]  Hey, let me start by saying you do a great show.
[02:31:00.174 --> 02:31:00.514]  Thank you.
[02:31:00.714 --> 02:31:03.277]  Hey, let me point out that I took X2 iodine.
[02:31:03.337 --> 02:31:04.619]  I started taking that stuff.
[02:31:04.659 --> 02:31:07.822]  The best iodine I think I ever found is what you guys are selling.
[02:31:07.943 --> 02:31:08.844]  When did you start taking it?
[02:31:09.124 --> 02:31:13.148]  About four years ago, I had high blood pressure, and I was on blood pressure medicine.
[02:31:13.209 --> 02:31:13.469]  Mm-hmm.
[02:31:13.729 --> 02:31:16.430]  And I started eating a little better, but my blood pressure stayed high.
[02:31:16.450 --> 02:31:23.974]  And when I took the X2 iodine after about two or four weeks, I think my body was detoxified of a bunch of metals and stuff that my body was storing.
[02:31:24.074 --> 02:31:26.295]  And my blood pressure came down to the perfect level.
[02:31:26.675 --> 02:31:29.617]  And I tell people the only thing I did was X2 iodine.
[02:31:30.077 --> 02:31:30.658]  I'm good to go.
[02:31:58.652 --> 02:32:10.455]  We are in the middle of a crude and ugly communist revolution funded by the big banks as a battering ram into a new age digital economy and a total surveillance state.
[02:32:10.915 --> 02:32:16.396]  All branches of government are attacking we the people and they offer us only one option.
[02:32:16.716 --> 02:32:18.917]  A meaningless vote in a rigged election.
[02:32:19.817 --> 02:32:20.678]  We're good to go.
[02:32:42.515 --> 02:32:46.157]  Share them, upload them, and send them everywhere.
[02:32:46.798 --> 02:32:50.440]  Let the world unite for truth, justice, and 1776 worldwide.
[02:33:35.012 --> 02:33:37.193]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:37.673 --> 02:33:42.936]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:43.116 --> 02:33:47.878]  You know, it's during these breaks that I literally bow my head and ask God to give me information.
[02:33:48.859 --> 02:33:50.880]  And during the break, I just bowed my head for about a minute.
[02:33:50.920 --> 02:33:53.681]  I said, God, what should I say on air?
[02:33:53.821 --> 02:33:54.802]  And literally, it just came to me.
[02:33:55.642 --> 02:33:57.003]  Look how far we've come.
[02:33:58.237 --> 02:34:01.478]  When I first got on air 29 plus years ago, almost nobody knew about this.
[02:34:02.098 --> 02:34:02.698]  I don't get the credit.
[02:34:02.718 --> 02:34:04.639]  It's just the fact that the New World Order came into play.
[02:34:04.759 --> 02:34:05.419]  It's out in the open now.
[02:34:05.439 --> 02:34:06.279]  That's why people are waking up.
[02:34:06.799 --> 02:34:17.022]  But look where we are now with Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan waking up and all the other top talk show hosts are anti-globalists now and more and more people are joining us.
[02:34:18.038 --> 02:34:22.123]  So as negative as things are, incredibly positive things are happening.
[02:34:22.143 --> 02:34:25.427]  And the Ukrainian government putting Tucker on a hit list.
[02:34:26.308 --> 02:34:30.152]  They put Jack Posobiec on six months ago and they ended up firing the person that did that.
[02:34:30.172 --> 02:34:31.734]  It was a Senate investigation.
[02:34:32.235 --> 02:34:37.841]  We're forcing the enemy to take the gloves off and take their mask off and get out in the open.
[02:34:39.355 --> 02:34:39.855]  We're good to go.
[02:34:39.915 --> 02:34:40.376]  We're good to go.
[02:35:03.217 --> 02:35:12.040]  Inside the illegal alien camps and the smugglers and confronting... Remember me and Drew went confronting smugglers and stopped the car and all that in South Texas?
[02:35:12.060 --> 02:35:13.041]  Well, he did it again.
[02:35:13.061 --> 02:35:16.902]  And I almost want to tell him, man, dude, be safe.
[02:35:17.162 --> 02:35:18.143]  Because it's dangerous.
[02:35:18.543 --> 02:35:20.704]  And the things they were saying, the arrogance.
[02:35:20.764 --> 02:35:23.205]  So you've got a lot of footage that's not even out yet.
[02:35:23.245 --> 02:35:24.365]  You've already put out so much.
[02:35:24.865 --> 02:35:26.006]  Drew, crazy.
[02:35:26.026 --> 02:35:30.667]  I want to talk about the border, what you've witnessed, what Biden's trying to do right now, spinning this.
[02:35:30.928 --> 02:35:31.768]  But before we go there...
[02:35:32.068 --> 02:35:39.734]  Tucker Carlson, the Putin interview, the open attempts at censorship, where America is, how would you describe the world today?
[02:35:41.069 --> 02:35:53.174]  Well, I think right now the world is exactly where Jesus said it would be, with lawlessness abounding and the rise of deception, which is right now in the 21st century, you're going to see that unfolding within the media predominantly.
[02:35:53.294 --> 02:35:59.196]  And this is why it's so important to become a part of the counter-narrative as we put forth the truth.
[02:35:59.337 --> 02:36:01.818]  And I think Tucker Carlson is trailblazing.
[02:36:02.478 --> 02:36:04.119]  When I saw what he was doing, I was crazy.
[02:36:04.139 --> 02:36:04.919]  And the response...
[02:36:05.819 --> 02:36:08.460]  I think they're really going to Assange Tucker.
[02:36:08.580 --> 02:36:12.202]  I think they really are going to move maybe Snowden him as well.
[02:36:12.222 --> 02:36:13.782]  But, you know, this is what's necessary.
[02:36:14.163 --> 02:36:16.243]  This is what's absolutely necessary right now.
[02:36:16.303 --> 02:36:26.207]  These peaceful actions, these peaceful moves that are made by simply just doing acts of journalism, reporting, and interviews with world leaders.
[02:36:26.247 --> 02:36:28.208]  What are they so scared of exactly?
[02:36:28.808 --> 02:36:30.649]  Folks, remember, it's free speech.
[02:36:30.709 --> 02:36:31.369]  It's an interview.
[02:36:31.629 --> 02:36:32.530]  How do we get to this?
[02:36:33.973 --> 02:36:35.674]  We got to this because we've allowed it.
[02:36:35.914 --> 02:36:51.041]  And we've got to this point now where they are showing their true colors, and I think that's part of the move, and that's what people are going to see, because they've attempted really aggressively to villainize Vladimir Putin, Russia, whatever your views may be on Putin and Russia.
[02:36:51.081 --> 02:36:53.502]  That's your own personal viewpoint, but you got it.
[02:36:53.542 --> 02:37:00.025]  You still can't avoid the fact that everything and anybody that they disagree with is a Russian agent.
[02:37:00.366 --> 02:37:03.207]  Even when Nancy Pelosi gets confronted in San Francisco...
[02:37:04.150 --> 02:37:05.792]  By these pro-Hamas protesters.
[02:37:05.992 --> 02:37:09.495]  What is her regurgitated NPC automatic response?
[02:37:10.256 --> 02:37:12.618]  Russian agents, Russian agents, Russian agents.
[02:37:12.678 --> 02:37:18.163]  The EU is trying to ban all the farmer protests as they turn their fuel and fertilizer off, saying they work for Putin.
[02:37:18.383 --> 02:37:20.625]  No, you're destroying their livelihood.
[02:37:20.865 --> 02:37:22.207]  They're fighting for their lives.
[02:37:22.447 --> 02:37:23.608]  Putin has nothing to do with it.
[02:37:24.793 --> 02:37:26.774]  Absolutely, and the narrative is crumbling.
[02:37:26.814 --> 02:37:28.635]  That's the point I'm trying to make here.
[02:37:28.935 --> 02:37:40.860]  This whole fabricated narrative where everything's a Russian agent, I mean, it crumbled and it fell apart post-2016 election where they tried to claim that it was Russian interference and Donald J. Trump, he colluded with the Russians.
[02:37:40.880 --> 02:37:44.382]  Oh, they act like Russians are like leprechauns that have magical powers.
[02:37:45.502 --> 02:37:46.503]  When in reality, it's them.
[02:37:47.205 --> 02:37:49.166]  They're the ones committing election interference.
[02:37:49.406 --> 02:37:50.007]  They're the ones.
[02:37:50.267 --> 02:37:55.710]  It's the weaponized FBI working alongside Twitter 1.0 to shut down the Hunter Biden laptop story.
[02:37:55.950 --> 02:37:58.131]  They're the ones in their globalist corruption.
[02:37:58.371 --> 02:37:59.852]  They're the ones with their tyranny.
[02:37:59.912 --> 02:38:04.535]  They're the ones that are suppressing American constitutional free God-given inalienable rights.
[02:38:04.795 --> 02:38:06.956]  See, but this is what's important right now.
[02:38:07.436 --> 02:38:08.257]  And I just want to say this.
[02:38:08.277 --> 02:38:11.558]  I don't want to switch the subject off the border, but we're talking about Tucker.
[02:38:11.979 --> 02:38:14.160]  I want people to really pay attention to the response.
[02:38:14.680 --> 02:38:17.881]  Because the response of these people is what's really red-pilling people.
[02:38:18.241 --> 02:38:29.804]  I think the response of how they're going to react, putting Tucker on a kill list, because he's a journalist and a reporter, interviewing someone unauthorized, what does that mean for all of us?
[02:38:30.164 --> 02:38:36.965]  Listen, listen, a journalist is not someone that went to school and has been appointed because they have some kind of a degree.
[02:38:37.406 --> 02:38:39.066]  A journalist is the First Amendment.
[02:38:39.626 --> 02:38:40.466]  Okay?
[02:38:40.766 --> 02:38:44.428]  And that's not to knock anybody that has gone to school and that has got a degree to do this.
[02:38:44.728 --> 02:38:45.648]  The point is this.
[02:38:46.168 --> 02:38:48.109]  It's an attack on America.
[02:38:48.369 --> 02:38:49.869]  It's not an attack on Tucker.
[02:38:50.249 --> 02:38:51.990]  It's an attack on American views.
[02:38:52.410 --> 02:38:55.591]  And I don't know if that's Tucker's intention.
[02:38:56.306 --> 02:38:59.629]  He kind of mentioned that in his video, but that's what people are going to see.
[02:38:59.649 --> 02:39:02.672]  So you've got to pay really close attention to the response of these people.
[02:39:02.712 --> 02:39:03.373]  No, I totally agree.
[02:39:03.433 --> 02:39:04.854]  And it's blowing up in their face.
[02:39:05.234 --> 02:39:08.317]  The little video he put out yesterday has 85 million views.
[02:39:09.158 --> 02:39:09.679]  That's the thing.
[02:39:09.959 --> 02:39:11.200]  They would have just shut up.
[02:39:11.240 --> 02:39:12.061]  It wouldn't have been a big deal.
[02:39:13.274 --> 02:39:13.755]  Absolutely.
[02:39:13.795 --> 02:39:17.618]  And people are waking up to the reality that their rights are being violated.
[02:39:17.778 --> 02:39:19.680]  And especially with this border stuff, Alex.
[02:39:19.740 --> 02:39:23.083]  I mean, for all the info warriors out there, I make it a point all the time.
[02:39:23.103 --> 02:39:25.405]  Whenever I'm on the ground, I go report on something.
[02:39:25.445 --> 02:39:26.947]  It's totally breaching the matrix.
[02:39:27.828 --> 02:39:28.188]  Alex Jones Show!
[02:39:28.208 --> 02:39:28.608]  We're good to go.
[02:39:28.629 --> 02:39:28.889]  I think?
[02:39:55.557 --> 02:40:01.632]  And you have these military-aged male encampments by the hundreds in your own damn backyard.
[02:40:01.652 --> 02:40:01.992]  Exactly.
[02:40:02.012 --> 02:40:03.777]  Start over and describe what you found.
[02:40:04.078 --> 02:40:04.799]  This is insane.
[02:40:05.805 --> 02:40:23.793]  Yeah, so before we get into this guy I had a little, you know, this fussy little Mexican guy, before we got into it with him, we show up to Jacumba in Southern California, and for those of you unfamiliar with the area, this is why I really wanted to shine a spotlight on this, because I believe it's getting underreported.
[02:40:23.813 --> 02:40:26.834]  There are several on-the-ground reporters, border journalists down there.
[02:40:26.854 --> 02:40:28.555]  There's plenty of reporting at Eagle Pass.
[02:40:28.575 --> 02:40:30.336]  There's plenty of reporting at Gary and Gab.
[02:40:30.756 --> 02:40:32.357]  It's all the other places they don't want us to look.
[02:40:33.323 --> 02:40:33.883]  Absolutely.
[02:40:33.963 --> 02:40:45.970]  So while we were in Eagle Pass, the InfoWars team that was there before me did a great, phenomenal job, but things slowed down, and we had conversations with our InfoWars Border Patrol source within, and we had a full conversation.
[02:40:45.990 --> 02:40:48.552]  I said, where do you think would be the spot right now?
[02:40:48.572 --> 02:40:54.475]  Should we stay here in Eagle Pass, Abbott's going to come tomorrow, give his little photo-op speech, or should we go somewhere else?
[02:40:55.015 --> 02:41:01.716]  And they told me straight up, I think you would be better off going to Jacumba, California, because it's popping there right now, and these people are coming straight over.
[02:41:01.756 --> 02:41:04.597]  So the photo op in Texas, yes, things have slowed down.
[02:41:04.917 --> 02:41:11.578]  There are little pockets here and there at Eagle Pass, other sectors in Texas, but it seems like they're rerouting.
[02:41:11.678 --> 02:41:18.499]  Southern Arizona, Sasabi has been getting flooded overnight with illegals, and obviously Jacumba, California.
[02:41:18.539 --> 02:41:21.140]  So we rerouted, and we went down.
[02:41:22.072 --> 02:41:33.537]  And this whole section, in Jacumba, like I said, it's about an hour south from SeaWorld in San Diego, just to give you San Diegans out there in Southern California how close this is.
[02:41:34.157 --> 02:41:36.758]  And there's a west side and an east side on the border wall.
[02:41:37.478 --> 02:41:46.181]  On the west side, the only thing stopping the illegals from getting in is literally just bobbed wire, and they go around the gate, and they come straight into the United States.
[02:41:46.221 --> 02:41:47.482]  There's an encampment right there.
[02:41:48.289 --> 02:41:52.012]  And they turn themselves into Border Patrol, just like we've been seeing across the U.S.
[02:41:52.673 --> 02:42:00.359]  And then there's another section on the east side on this border wall in Chucumba, California, where there is no one there.
[02:42:00.659 --> 02:42:05.203]  The barbed wire is all trampled on, and people could just walk directly through.
[02:42:05.903 --> 02:42:10.367]  And here's what's interesting about this, and this brings me to this fussy little Mexican guy that I debated.
[02:42:10.807 --> 02:42:15.591]  So on that east side, Alex, where they're coming straight through, it's about an hour and a half walk
[02:42:16.448 --> 02:42:25.432]  I would estimate an hour at the least walk on foot through the hills in Jakumba where you walk through from this east side where there's no one stopping you.
[02:42:25.452 --> 02:42:26.193]  There's no border patrol.
[02:42:26.213 --> 02:42:27.113]  There's nobody there.
[02:42:27.533 --> 02:42:40.440]  And the illegals come through and they walk about an hour, an hour and a half through the hills in Jakumba and there's a little encampment off of the Old Town 80 highway in Jakumba.
[02:42:40.680 --> 02:42:42.181]  This is in San Diego County.
[02:42:42.201 --> 02:42:44.922]  So they walk about an hour and a half into the United States.
[02:42:45.322 --> 02:42:47.063]  You know they're getting paid by the UN.
[02:42:47.103 --> 02:42:49.964]  What you get is the bait for all these people.
[02:43:03.809 --> 02:43:08.871]  Yes, we know that these are NGOs, but that's why I was really pressing them to get a confirmation on camera.
[02:43:08.891 --> 02:43:13.493]  You know how it works, Alex, but we can assume because that's the majority that we have seen.
[02:43:13.553 --> 02:43:15.734]  But they just claim to be Christians.
[02:43:15.854 --> 02:43:17.775]  They claim to be doing the word of God.
[02:43:18.175 --> 02:43:22.197]  And that's what really pissed me off the most because I'm like, okay, now we're going to have a conversation.
[02:43:22.717 --> 02:43:23.898]  So you can't sit here.
[02:43:23.938 --> 02:43:26.199]  And I think this is part of what needs to happen, Alex.
[02:43:27.755 --> 02:43:31.097]  Right now in 2024, we really do need to separate the sheep from the goats.
[02:43:31.618 --> 02:43:40.865]  We should have a zero-tolerance policy for anybody that is showing any signs of anti-American rhetoric or actions or views.
[02:43:41.225 --> 02:43:42.546]  I don't care what color you are.
[02:43:42.627 --> 02:43:43.527]  I don't care where you come from.
[02:43:43.547 --> 02:43:45.669]  It's not that we even hate the victims they're bringing in.
[02:43:46.009 --> 02:43:48.071]  It's that it's being organized to bring the country down.
[02:43:49.073 --> 02:43:49.674]  Absolutely.
[02:43:49.834 --> 02:43:51.716]  And so that's why I confronted these guys.
[02:43:51.736 --> 02:43:54.739]  It's like, you're going to sit here and tell me, oh, we're doing the work of God.
[02:43:54.779 --> 02:43:55.440]  You point up.
[02:43:55.480 --> 02:43:57.963]  So I confronted them because we need to separate this.
[02:43:57.983 --> 02:44:00.426]  All right, because this has happened to us, right, Alex?
[02:44:00.446 --> 02:44:01.407]  This is part of the op.
[02:44:02.054 --> 02:44:02.694]  We're good to go.
[02:44:02.754 --> 02:44:02.954]  I think?
[02:44:26.420 --> 02:44:27.481]  You don't have to get aggressive.
[02:44:27.521 --> 02:44:28.322]  You don't have to get violent.
[02:44:47.182 --> 02:45:00.526]  All you got to do is walk up and ask them, especially if they claim to be Christians, okay, what is your justification to you aiding and abetting this illegal operation here in my country, in the United States of America?
[02:45:00.766 --> 02:45:01.706]  That's my authority.
[02:45:01.826 --> 02:45:05.767]  As a Christian, I have the authority to question you because you claim to be a Christian, number one.
[02:45:06.007 --> 02:45:12.849]  Number two, I have the authority to question you because there's an illegal operation taking place right before my very eyes, and I'm watching you do it.
[02:45:13.209 --> 02:45:14.290]  I need an answer from you.
[02:45:14.490 --> 02:45:15.310]  Why are you doing this?
[02:45:15.530 --> 02:45:16.651]  How are you doing this?
[02:45:16.871 --> 02:45:17.632]  You want to know, Alex?
[02:45:17.832 --> 02:45:30.665]  You want to know why these so-called Christian Catholic NGOs, they can't provide an answer to justify aiding and abetting human trafficking operations, encouraging and incentivizing more illegal immigration for these people to come here?
[02:45:30.885 --> 02:45:32.266]  Because there isn't an answer, Alex.
[02:45:32.987 --> 02:45:34.188]  There is no answer to this.
[02:45:34.228 --> 02:45:35.489]  There is no answer in the Bible.
[02:45:35.729 --> 02:45:37.090]  There is no answer in the Scriptures.
[02:45:37.330 --> 02:45:40.252]  Because Jesus Christ does not encourage lawlessness.
[02:45:40.413 --> 02:45:41.013]  Well, let's be clear.
[02:45:41.033 --> 02:45:41.413]  It's that simple.
[02:45:41.453 --> 02:45:46.217]  They're bringing, we caught new footage I got sent by Border Patrol, of little kids they'd already seen before.
[02:45:46.277 --> 02:45:47.418]  And they start crying.
[02:45:47.738 --> 02:45:49.759]  The kids are begging us, take us away, help us.
[02:45:50.160 --> 02:45:55.364]  And the Border Patrol's ordered to hand them over to an NGO and let them disappear again to see them a month later.
[02:45:55.804 --> 02:46:01.068]  And that's what's really getting to the Border Patrol, is they keep seeing the kids being used over and over again.
[02:46:02.242 --> 02:46:03.806]  Because they're nothing but commodities.
[02:46:04.467 --> 02:46:05.831]  That's what people need to understand.
[02:46:05.851 --> 02:46:07.514]  This is the slave traffic, folks.
[02:46:07.875 --> 02:46:09.158]  This is modern slavery.
[02:46:09.579 --> 02:46:10.963]  Oh, they're here for a better life.
[02:46:11.023 --> 02:46:12.165]  No, they're being used.
[02:46:13.766 --> 02:46:14.306]  Absolutely.
[02:46:14.366 --> 02:46:25.252]  And just to push back on the SJWs, because they say, oh, well, we need billions of dollars in reparations for all the black people in the United States of America because they're victims of slavery.
[02:46:25.332 --> 02:46:36.617]  And we need to make sure that we wash the sins away of America in the past by making sure that we make it very clear that we are anti-slavery here in the United States of America.
[02:46:36.837 --> 02:46:38.458]  But they don't want to talk about this, Alex.
[02:46:38.638 --> 02:46:41.439]  You're not allowed to talk about the children that are being recycled.
[02:46:41.959 --> 02:46:42.880]  Recycled!
[02:46:44.100 --> 02:46:45.381]  They're being recycled.
[02:46:45.901 --> 02:46:47.402]  They get pushed through the southern border.
[02:46:47.702 --> 02:46:48.562]  Human trafficked.
[02:46:48.842 --> 02:46:50.903]  They're here by the cartels in the United States.
[02:46:51.103 --> 02:46:52.304]  They send them back.
[02:46:53.004 --> 02:46:56.345]  And then they rotate them over and over and over and over and over.
[02:46:56.565 --> 02:47:04.608]  And you want to know, the Border Patrol and the Texas DPS, these guys, man, it is really hard to have to deal with this.
[02:47:05.129 --> 02:47:07.650]  It is really hard to have to be put in a position.
[02:47:07.670 --> 02:47:08.230]  They're pissed.
[02:47:09.005 --> 02:47:09.525]  They're sick of it.
[02:47:09.585 --> 02:47:10.066]  They're sick of it.
[02:47:10.086 --> 02:47:10.566]  They're pissed.
[02:47:10.626 --> 02:47:16.369]  And that's why I think it was a great... And I had a conversation with this Border Patrol agent in Eagle Pass.
[02:47:17.670 --> 02:47:28.816]  And he wanted me to make it very clear that everyone's talking about civil war and this conflict between Texas DPS and Border Patrol because the feds are going to have some mass conflict down there.
[02:47:29.580 --> 02:47:30.700]  And he made it very clear.
[02:47:30.740 --> 02:47:31.601]  He said, you know what, Drew?
[02:47:32.441 --> 02:47:33.281]  We're all unified.
[02:47:33.361 --> 02:47:34.181]  We're sick of this.
[02:47:34.561 --> 02:47:35.782]  We don't want this anymore.
[02:47:36.362 --> 02:47:37.882]  We hate what Biden is doing.
[02:47:38.242 --> 02:47:39.503]  We don't want to fight each other.
[02:47:39.983 --> 02:47:40.403]  All right, sir.
[02:47:40.483 --> 02:47:43.624]  I'll communicate that because I think people need to know.
[02:47:43.644 --> 02:47:45.144]  That's all lies put up in the media.
[02:47:45.844 --> 02:47:47.585]  And again, people say, oh, we'll quit your job.
[02:47:48.465 --> 02:47:52.706]  Then if they quit, they'll even put pure NGOs in who will rape the kids right there on scene.
[02:47:53.587 --> 02:47:55.107]  It's just it's very hard to deal with.
[02:47:56.334 --> 02:47:59.198]  And Alex, unfortunately, I think that's part of the operation.
[02:47:59.538 --> 02:48:01.440]  I mean, that's what Defund the Police was, correct?
[02:48:01.601 --> 02:48:02.802]  It's a regime installation.
[02:48:03.082 --> 02:48:04.965]  Get rid of all the good guys, alright?
[02:48:05.005 --> 02:48:07.688]  Get rid of anyone that has a conscience, okay?
[02:48:07.748 --> 02:48:13.415]  Put them in a position where they have to choose between defending their country or betraying their country.
[02:48:13.796 --> 02:48:15.298]  And anyone with a good conscience...
[02:48:16.339 --> 02:48:23.547]  They're going to tap out, they're going to retire, they're not going to want to deal with it, they're going to walk away, or they'll astound their ground and they'll become a whistleblower.
[02:48:23.587 --> 02:48:29.313]  We've seen this over and over and over again, but part of that operation is a regime installation.
[02:48:29.393 --> 02:48:36.180]  It's to replace good men and women that have a heart and a conscience that don't want to deal with this anymore, so they're pushed out.
[02:48:36.921 --> 02:48:38.802]  And the same thing is happening with the Border Patrol.
[02:48:38.983 --> 02:48:39.803]  The same thing is happening.
[02:48:40.123 --> 02:48:43.486]  Anything that the feds could hijack in terms of law enforcement.
[02:48:43.526 --> 02:48:43.986]  Oh, the military.
[02:48:44.006 --> 02:48:48.369]  They did the poison shots and the transgender and the critical race theory.
[02:48:48.389 --> 02:48:50.591]  And they're like, oh, we have a record low recruitment.
[02:48:50.711 --> 02:48:51.571]  That's what they want.
[02:48:53.112 --> 02:48:53.693]  Absolutely.
[02:48:54.133 --> 02:49:00.878]  And I kind of noticed this in Jakumba as well, because anytime we go down there, Alex, these guys love us, man.
[02:49:01.038 --> 02:49:05.161]  You know, especially when they know who you are and they know, you know, what your intent is, is to...
[02:49:06.656 --> 02:49:08.918]  This insane illegal invasion.
[02:49:08.938 --> 02:49:14.783]  I mean, there's no legal invasion, but it's just this illegal human trafficking operation.
[02:49:15.243 --> 02:49:24.391]  Anytime you go down to Texas or you go down to Arizona, and I start to have conversations with these Border Patrol agents, whether it's on camera or off camera, off record.
[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:25.861]  They're always talking.
[02:49:26.181 --> 02:49:34.708]  Especially when they Google you and like, okay, I feel safe talking to this guy because I know he's not some fake news cuck trying to spin everything, like everything's okay.
[02:49:35.209 --> 02:49:36.430]  They're always willing to talk.
[02:49:36.986 --> 02:49:37.486]  We're good to go.
[02:49:58.340 --> 02:50:02.805]  And then we also had a conversation with one, and he said, oh, I'm sorry, I can't talk to you guys.
[02:50:02.945 --> 02:50:11.153]  I love what you guys are doing, but, you know, I got to redirect you to, you know, the media comms for the Border Patrol representative.
[02:50:11.353 --> 02:50:13.735]  And, you know, no, no, no, no, no knock on them.
[02:50:13.875 --> 02:50:18.740]  Just it's something to note because this whole area, they got drones in the sky on the U.S.
[02:50:18.780 --> 02:50:19.160]  side.
[02:50:19.260 --> 02:50:21.503]  Oh, yeah, no, it's the policy drawing them here.
[02:50:21.983 --> 02:50:22.303]  Absolutely.
[02:50:22.383 --> 02:50:25.764]  And let me go back to this little Mexican guy that I debated.
[02:50:25.884 --> 02:50:28.905]  I want America to really pay attention to what was said there.
[02:50:28.985 --> 02:50:29.485]  All right?
[02:50:29.505 --> 02:50:32.026]  Because you got Infowars on the ground.
[02:50:32.046 --> 02:50:33.866]  We played it earlier, and we posted some posts.
[02:50:34.967 --> 02:50:36.267]  We'll put the full 10-minute debate up.
[02:50:36.287 --> 02:50:37.847]  But what happened with this guy?
[02:50:37.867 --> 02:50:38.508]  Yeah.
[02:50:51.847 --> 02:50:54.948]  I just want to comment on the statement he made.
[02:50:55.508 --> 02:50:57.049]  And America needs to take this serious.
[02:50:57.189 --> 02:50:58.709]  It doesn't matter what your politics are.
[02:50:58.729 --> 02:51:04.291]  It doesn't matter if you identify as a Democrat or Republican, a left-winger or a right-winger.
[02:51:04.311 --> 02:51:05.271]  It does not matter.
[02:51:05.291 --> 02:51:09.112]  This guy would not identify his citizenship, okay?
[02:51:09.452 --> 02:51:11.393]  And I made mine very clear as an American.
[02:51:11.433 --> 02:51:12.613]  I'm proud to be American, dude.
[02:51:12.653 --> 02:51:13.774]  You want to know my citizenship?
[02:51:13.914 --> 02:51:14.474]  Here you go.
[02:51:14.994 --> 02:51:15.794]  Didn't have an answer.
[02:51:16.515 --> 02:51:17.195]  And what does he say?
[02:51:17.215 --> 02:51:19.235]  He says, you think this is your country?
[02:51:19.255 --> 02:51:21.236]  He says, F America.
[02:51:22.017 --> 02:51:23.658]  This is a Mexican territory.
[02:51:24.179 --> 02:51:28.443]  I want people at home to really let that resonate, okay?
[02:51:28.463 --> 02:51:30.685]  Because how far does that really go?
[02:51:30.785 --> 02:51:35.509]  It goes farther beyond, and Alex, you know this, this goes way beyond what we're seeing right now.
[02:51:36.109 --> 02:51:38.952]  Okay, right now we are watching the facilitation.
[02:51:39.372 --> 02:51:45.257]  We are watching the importation of this replacement migration, illegal human trafficking operation.
[02:51:45.297 --> 02:51:48.280]  Yeah, the UN admits they plan to break the United States up along ethnic lines.
[02:51:49.221 --> 02:51:51.041]  And wait until they activate these people.
[02:51:51.342 --> 02:51:53.222]  These people are filled with hatred.
[02:51:53.502 --> 02:51:54.602]  They hate Americans.
[02:51:54.962 --> 02:51:55.783]  They hate you.
[02:51:56.083 --> 02:51:57.683]  They know they're here to replace you.
[02:51:57.703 --> 02:52:01.444]  And guys like this, they know exactly what they're doing and why they're doing it.
[02:52:01.664 --> 02:52:06.685]  But at the same time, let me make another observation as well, Alex.
[02:52:07.085 --> 02:52:15.487]  So this guy's obviously this Mexican allegiant that thinks that the state of California is a Mexican territory.
[02:52:15.527 --> 02:52:16.007]  It's U.S.
[02:52:16.067 --> 02:52:16.448]  soil.
[02:52:16.768 --> 02:52:18.048]  What a crazy statement to make.
[02:52:18.843 --> 02:52:22.264]  But it's interesting because the majority of the illegals coming in are not Mexicans.
[02:52:22.985 --> 02:52:24.005]  They're coming from China.
[02:52:24.485 --> 02:52:27.046]  They're coming from Guatemala, Honduras.
[02:52:27.127 --> 02:52:28.327]  They're coming from Ecuador.
[02:52:28.347 --> 02:52:31.909]  They're coming from Colombia, Venezuela, from Afghanistan, Iraq.
[02:52:31.929 --> 02:52:32.989]  They're coming from the Middle East.
[02:52:33.009 --> 02:52:33.889]  They're coming from Ukraine.
[02:52:33.909 --> 02:52:34.910]  They're coming from Russia.
[02:52:35.590 --> 02:52:38.551]  A lot of military-aged men specifically in this location.
[02:52:38.571 --> 02:52:43.934]  This is why I really wanted to put a flashlight on this, Alex, because California needs to see this, man.
[02:52:44.394 --> 02:52:46.975]  And the point I want to make is
[02:52:47.754 --> 02:52:58.687]  This guy thinks that he, okay, as a Mexican, is reclaiming Mexican territory by importing all of these foreign nationals from all over the world into the United States?
[02:52:59.628 --> 02:53:03.872]  Even these NPCs, these UN globalist NPCs have no idea.
[02:53:03.953 --> 02:53:05.815]  No, he's conquering America for the globalists.
[02:53:06.610 --> 02:53:07.130]  Exactly.
[02:53:07.330 --> 02:53:09.211]  And he probably doesn't even realize that.
[02:53:09.631 --> 02:53:10.672]  You see what I'm saying, Alex?
[02:53:10.712 --> 02:53:20.656]  Because these people are just being weaponized by Satan to facilitate this evil agenda that is collapsing sovereignty of nations, which God has given us sovereignty.
[02:53:20.696 --> 02:53:22.397]  This is clear in the book of Acts.
[02:53:22.697 --> 02:53:23.578]  We're good to go.
[02:53:23.598 --> 02:53:24.319]  We're good to go.
[02:53:42.270 --> 02:53:43.911]  He doesn't want satanic unity.
[02:53:44.291 --> 02:53:44.631]  Alright?
[02:53:44.691 --> 02:53:46.012]  Because people... No, exactly.
[02:53:46.032 --> 02:53:46.492]  That's what I meant.
[02:53:46.532 --> 02:53:48.113]  He knows Satan's trying to create a unity.
[02:53:48.493 --> 02:53:49.213]  I'm not correcting you.
[02:53:49.233 --> 02:53:49.953]  No, you're the pastor.
[02:53:49.993 --> 02:53:50.434]  Explain it to me.
[02:53:50.474 --> 02:53:51.514]  I get the layman term.
[02:53:52.054 --> 02:53:52.475]  It's okay.
[02:53:52.535 --> 02:53:54.696]  It's just... I think this is where people get it twisted, Alex.
[02:53:54.716 --> 02:53:57.217]  Yeah, God wants unity under God, but not under Satan.
[02:53:57.257 --> 02:53:57.697]  Explain that.
[02:53:58.637 --> 02:53:58.998]  Exactly.
[02:53:59.038 --> 02:54:08.722]  This is where people get... And I would even say this is where maybe Bible-believing Christians might even kind of get cornered and put into a corner.
[02:54:08.742 --> 02:54:09.862]  Well, let's go back to Tower of Babel.
[02:54:09.942 --> 02:54:10.983]  Why did God not want that?
[02:54:11.989 --> 02:54:12.429]  Exactly.
[02:54:13.990 --> 02:54:14.930]  Unity is not bad.
[02:54:15.610 --> 02:54:16.630]  You see that in the church.
[02:54:17.370 --> 02:54:20.671]  Born-again Christians, we are the church, we are the born-again.
[02:54:21.532 --> 02:54:24.072]  Jesus prayed this in John chapter 17, correct?
[02:54:24.112 --> 02:54:28.293]  Like, I pray that they'd be unified, I pray that they'd be together, but that's unified around what?
[02:54:28.573 --> 02:54:29.554]  It's the ideology.
[02:54:29.874 --> 02:54:31.094]  And unified around who?
[02:54:31.274 --> 02:54:31.594]  God.
[02:54:31.934 --> 02:54:34.515]  Because the word unity could get you into a place...
[02:54:35.135 --> 02:54:35.956]  It's a false unity.
[02:54:36.136 --> 02:54:36.917]  It's a false unity.
[02:54:56.896 --> 02:55:00.799]  So explain to me your research, because you're a pastor too, and I really respect you.
[02:55:00.839 --> 02:55:01.279]  Christ unity...
[02:55:18.630 --> 02:55:25.136]  That comes when Christ returns versus the Bible saying we have nations and peoples and God destroying the Tower of Babel.
[02:55:25.396 --> 02:55:26.517]  He didn't want that unity.
[02:55:27.618 --> 02:55:32.602]  Yeah, it's very simple because the Tower of Babel, that was a satanic operation, all right?
[02:55:32.622 --> 02:55:34.824]  Because the heartbeat of Lucifer, right?
[02:55:34.864 --> 02:55:36.426]  Why was Lucifer cast out of heaven?
[02:55:36.486 --> 02:55:38.427]  Because his heart was lifted up in pride.
[02:55:38.648 --> 02:55:39.608]  He wanted to be God.
[02:55:39.629 --> 02:55:42.771]  He wanted to rise above the heavens, above the throne of God.
[02:55:43.072 --> 02:55:44.753]  He wanted God's position, right?
[02:55:45.319 --> 02:55:47.442]  Okay, so that is the heartbeat of Lucifer.
[02:55:47.722 --> 02:55:53.310]  And you see this throughout the Old Testament and the New Testament where civilization attempts to do the same exact thing.
[02:55:53.350 --> 02:55:55.473]  They erect the Tower of Babel.
[02:55:55.693 --> 02:55:56.915]  They want to ascend into the heavens.
[02:55:56.935 --> 02:55:58.577]  They want to ascend above God.
[02:55:58.857 --> 02:56:01.401]  And it's a global unity without God.
[02:56:01.821 --> 02:56:02.562]  We're good to go.
[02:56:20.057 --> 02:56:21.138]  The Bible is the filter.
[02:56:21.198 --> 02:56:22.639]  I don't care what anybody has to say.
[02:56:22.659 --> 02:56:24.121]  They say it in the name of God.
[02:56:24.361 --> 02:56:25.622]  They say it in the name of Christ.
[02:56:25.922 --> 02:56:29.205]  If it does not line up with the Bible, reject it.
[02:56:29.465 --> 02:56:30.326]  That's your filter.
[02:56:30.566 --> 02:56:31.487]  That's your survival.
[02:56:31.707 --> 02:56:32.508]  That's your discernment.
[02:56:32.668 --> 02:56:35.371]  So the difference between this satanic unity that you see...
[02:56:35.851 --> 02:56:39.092]  It's this spirit of the Antichrist that shows up in the end times.
[02:56:39.572 --> 02:56:44.334]  That is this global, unified, humanitarian kumbaya.
[02:56:44.474 --> 02:56:45.675]  Everyone looks the same.
[02:56:45.735 --> 02:56:46.935]  Everyone sounds the same.
[02:56:47.255 --> 02:56:48.876]  Even the military is unified.
[02:56:49.196 --> 02:56:51.097]  The global economy is unified.
[02:56:51.457 --> 02:56:54.258]  Politics, it's a global death cult in the end.
[02:56:54.758 --> 02:56:56.179]  But what are they unified around?
[02:56:56.940 --> 02:56:57.941]  Not Jesus Christ.
[02:56:58.021 --> 02:57:00.182]  It's whatever the mark of the beast tells you to do.
[02:57:00.522 --> 02:57:01.743]  You have to worship the beast.
[02:57:01.983 --> 02:57:03.444]  You don't just get the mark and buy and sell.
[02:57:03.464 --> 02:57:06.806]  You have to follow the beast, worship it, which is the social credit score.
[02:57:08.247 --> 02:57:08.787]  Absolutely.
[02:57:08.847 --> 02:57:10.448]  The mark of the beast is not only...
[02:57:11.728 --> 02:57:18.533]  A piece of technology or a mark of the culture to receive at that time in order to participate in the economy at that time.
[02:57:18.573 --> 02:57:19.794]  That's just part of it.
[02:57:20.314 --> 02:57:23.076]  The mark of the beast at the time is an allegiant.
[02:57:23.356 --> 02:57:28.220]  Your proclamation that the Antichrist is God himself in the flesh.
[02:57:29.060 --> 02:57:31.402]  If you accept that, that's what you are proclaiming.
[02:57:31.422 --> 02:57:32.343]  You take that mark.
[02:57:32.623 --> 02:57:34.884]  But you reject that, you're going to get killed for it.
[02:57:35.425 --> 02:57:35.685]  Why?
[02:57:35.765 --> 02:57:37.246]  Because you're rejecting him as God.
[02:57:38.058 --> 02:57:38.738]  Serious stuff, guys.
[02:57:39.459 --> 02:57:42.040]  Let's do five more minutes, and then our guest host takes over.

[02:58:55.054 --> 02:58:56.574]  Winter is coming.
[02:58:56.874 --> 02:58:58.275]  Winter isn't coming.
[02:58:58.855 --> 02:59:00.135]  Winter is here.

[02:59:51.354 --> 02:59:58.517]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:00.538 --> 03:00:05.061]  You can see the Satanism out in the open.
[03:00:05.621 --> 03:00:06.921]  It is good versus evil.
[03:00:08.082 --> 03:00:09.423]  I've been trying to shoot a report for weeks.
[03:00:09.443 --> 03:00:10.903]  I'm going to try to shoot it today or tomorrow.
[03:00:11.644 --> 03:00:12.384]  So much is happening.
[03:00:12.444 --> 03:00:13.765]  I've done months of research.
[03:00:14.980 --> 03:00:15.560]  We're good to go.
[03:00:42.935 --> 03:00:50.483]  And I think that's the problem with a lot of self-proclaimed Christians because they don't have a biblical foundation.
[03:00:50.543 --> 03:00:52.645]  It's quite literally that simple.
[03:00:53.105 --> 03:00:56.669]  Because how can you discern and identify what you're really unified around?
[03:00:56.749 --> 03:01:02.915]  Am I unified around some kind of satanically, demonically empowered movement?
[03:01:03.495 --> 03:01:06.819]  Am I empowered, excuse me, am I unified around some kind of
[03:01:07.919 --> 03:01:08.700]  Holy Spirit.
[03:01:09.181 --> 03:01:11.444]  A biblically empowered movement by God.
[03:01:11.865 --> 03:01:16.571]  And the only way you're going to be able to tell is if the actions displayed before you, the fruits.
[03:01:16.812 --> 03:01:18.614]  It's what Christ said.
[03:01:18.674 --> 03:01:20.157]  Is it just what we do?
[03:01:20.217 --> 03:01:22.340]  The enemy comes after you when you're going against them.
[03:01:23.476 --> 03:01:23.996]  Absolutely.
[03:01:24.036 --> 03:01:26.718]  You could see the byproduct in persecution, definitely.
[03:01:26.758 --> 03:01:31.980]  People are going to come after you for taking a stance, not only for truth, but the truth.
[03:01:32.461 --> 03:01:34.562]  You really want to see some levels of persecution.
[03:01:34.642 --> 03:01:38.824]  Start really standing for Christ pretty much anywhere, publicly, wherever you are.
[03:01:38.864 --> 03:01:42.466]  And you've seen these levels of that, Alex, especially with InfoWars.
[03:01:43.366 --> 03:01:44.327]  We're good to go.
[03:01:44.407 --> 03:01:44.867]  We're good to go.
[03:02:09.285 --> 03:02:18.768]  All of these influential institutions, not only in the United States, but worldwide, globally, especially with the collapse of the southern border of the United States of America.
[03:02:18.828 --> 03:02:22.489]  And I think a lot, because I've had conversations with so-called Christians.
[03:02:22.509 --> 03:02:26.710]  I'm like, yeah, but you know, the Bible does say we got to take care of the foreigner.
[03:02:26.790 --> 03:02:31.152]  The Bible does say that we should love our enemy as ourself, love your neighbor as yourself.
[03:02:31.972 --> 03:02:35.073]  But then I push back and I say, well, what does that really mean?
[03:02:36.903 --> 03:02:42.288]  What if you're dealing with an operation that is totally 100% satanically charged?
[03:02:42.308 --> 03:02:44.850]  The UN cut off their food for three years.
[03:02:44.890 --> 03:02:47.293]  They are victims, but now they're used as a weapon.
[03:02:47.693 --> 03:02:49.255]  It's part of the UN plan.
[03:02:51.095 --> 03:02:52.076]  They've been weaponized.
[03:02:52.536 --> 03:02:54.318]  And they're being weaponized at the same time.
[03:02:54.358 --> 03:02:56.140]  Just wait until these people get activated, Alex.
[03:02:56.200 --> 03:02:56.500]  You know.
[03:02:56.620 --> 03:02:56.880]  You know.
[03:02:56.900 --> 03:02:57.701]  I don't have to tell you.
[03:02:57.961 --> 03:03:02.045]  Just wait until these people get activated like they've been activated in France and Germany and in Europe.
[03:03:02.365 --> 03:03:03.506]  Then the church is going to wake up.
[03:03:03.566 --> 03:03:04.967]  Europe is five years ahead of us.
[03:03:05.348 --> 03:03:06.129]  They bring them in.
[03:03:06.189 --> 03:03:07.550]  Then they politically activate them.
[03:03:08.570 --> 03:03:09.971]  Yeah, how's the church doing there?
[03:03:10.952 --> 03:03:14.776]  They burned down 5,000 churches in France alone the last few years.
[03:03:15.556 --> 03:03:16.137]  Exactly.
[03:03:16.477 --> 03:03:21.401]  And because once they get activated, that's when people wake up to the reality of what's going on here.
[03:03:21.682 --> 03:03:24.424]  That's why I don't like using the term border crisis, Alex.
[03:03:24.684 --> 03:03:25.245]  I don't like it.
[03:03:25.585 --> 03:03:28.708]  It sounds like... No, it's the end of America crisis.
[03:03:28.768 --> 03:03:29.809]  It's the UN invasion.
[03:03:30.717 --> 03:03:36.341]  But the term crisis just sounds like a hurricane's coming through.
[03:03:36.381 --> 03:03:38.343]  How about the border war?
[03:03:38.363 --> 03:03:39.123]  What should we call it?
[03:03:39.764 --> 03:03:40.544]  It's an invasion.
[03:03:40.905 --> 03:03:42.586]  It's a collapse of American sovereignty.
[03:03:42.626 --> 03:03:43.166]  That's what it is.
[03:03:43.326 --> 03:03:44.607]  It's a total invasion.
[03:03:44.667 --> 03:03:46.649]  Like you said, UN-backed, globalist-backed.
[03:03:47.296 --> 03:03:50.819]  Because to imply it's a crisis means that, like, we don't have control.
[03:03:50.859 --> 03:03:52.100]  This is strategic, Alex.
[03:03:52.120 --> 03:03:52.500]  You know this.
[03:03:52.600 --> 03:03:54.922]  All of this is preplanned, strategic U.S.
[03:03:54.962 --> 03:03:59.886]  government working with cartels and foreign globalist entities and NGOs, 501c3s, C4s.
[03:04:00.106 --> 03:04:01.227]  They get these FEMA grants.
[03:04:01.247 --> 03:04:07.672]  They get all of these government grants that are all coming in, importing to these NGOs to facilitate these people coming into our country.
[03:04:07.952 --> 03:04:08.653]  It's lawless!
[03:04:09.253 --> 03:04:15.318]  As a Christian, you can't sit here and say, well, I support that and I want to participate to help these people.
[03:04:15.338 --> 03:04:17.400]  No, these people are being used.
[03:04:17.620 --> 03:04:21.784]  And a lot of them, I'm telling you, you talk to Border Patrol, they're like, the majority of these people are not family.
[03:04:21.804 --> 03:04:24.126]  Doesn't the Bible tell us where Satan is or is anarchy?
[03:04:26.255 --> 03:04:26.875]  Lawlessness.
[03:04:27.155 --> 03:04:28.856]  Total anarchy and lawlessness.
[03:04:28.956 --> 03:04:32.677]  And right now, what we are watching is this mass operation.
[03:04:33.117 --> 03:04:34.357]  Anarchy, lawlessness.
[03:04:34.817 --> 03:04:36.017]  We serve a God of order.
[03:04:36.037 --> 03:04:40.218]  The Bible says the God that we serve, Jesus Christ, is a God of order.
[03:04:40.558 --> 03:04:41.639]  And right now, we don't have that.
[03:04:41.939 --> 03:04:43.899]  Drew, how do people find the great reports you're posting?
[03:04:44.920 --> 03:04:53.342]  You guys can follow me on X at DrewHLive, but make sure to support Band.Video, InfoWarsStore.com so we can continue to do some on-the-ground reporting here.
[03:04:53.382 --> 03:04:54.042]  Be safe, Drew.
[03:04:54.102 --> 03:04:54.542]  Great job.
[03:04:54.562 --> 03:04:54.942]  We love you.
[03:04:55.987 --> 03:04:56.207]  Love you.
[03:05:19.667 --> 03:05:20.128]  We're good to go.
[03:05:38.809 --> 03:05:46.319]  This is next-level information, and it's a great way to not just support the broadcast, but inform yourself of the next level and share the book with friends and family.
[03:05:46.579 --> 03:05:52.947]  So whether you want one copy or multiple copies, go now to Infowarsstore.com and get The Great Awakening.
[03:05:53.147 --> 03:05:54.389]  This is going to go to number one.
[03:05:54.669 --> 03:05:55.690]  I want to thank you for your support.
[03:05:55.871 --> 03:05:56.672]  It's a powerful book.
[03:05:56.912 --> 03:05:57.453]  Get yours now.
[03:06:07.088 --> 03:06:10.790]  And we are live here in the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:10.910 --> 03:06:12.711]  I am Jason Burmess.
[03:06:12.731 --> 03:06:17.334]  We're going to be talking about the quote-unquote well-being economy.
[03:06:17.414 --> 03:06:23.917]  But something Alex talked about an hour ago totally changed up my intro.
[03:06:23.957 --> 03:06:32.882]  Because really, when we talk about this well-being economy, what he led with, and the profound fact that in a lot of ways we've lost, guys.
[03:06:33.362 --> 03:06:34.582]  We've totally lost.
[03:06:34.923 --> 03:06:35.083]  That...
[03:06:36.147 --> 03:06:37.267]  We're good to go.
[03:06:37.287 --> 03:06:38.088]  I think?
[03:06:59.201 --> 03:07:00.221]  I want to emphasize that.
[03:07:00.621 --> 03:07:03.902]  Release all the data by serious scientists.
[03:07:04.162 --> 03:07:04.522]  Say what?
[03:07:04.542 --> 03:07:12.524]  It was in the United States in September or October, one of the worst flu seasons ever.
[03:07:12.544 --> 03:07:22.166]  And remember, even media reports of what popcorn lung and too much vaping as young people were also being hospitalized.
[03:07:22.486 --> 03:07:23.426]  Coincidence, I know.
[03:07:24.221 --> 03:07:39.364]  But then, when it reached China, which I also believe was seeded there by some entity, when you look at this thing, again, you had Chinese military officials coming out and saying they believed it was the U.S.
[03:07:39.444 --> 03:07:41.664]  seeding it during the military Wuhan games.
[03:07:42.564 --> 03:07:47.525]  I'm not saying that's correct, but this was not an accidental release.
[03:07:47.565 --> 03:07:51.066]  This was a bioweapons attack on humanity.
[03:07:51.878 --> 03:07:55.760]  Well-knowing because they held their little Event 201 drills.
[03:07:55.780 --> 03:08:00.582]  These people love to brag, and we're going to get into that, about the well-being economy.
[03:08:02.263 --> 03:08:08.066]  Where they had a coronavirus outbreak from South America.
[03:08:08.646 --> 03:08:14.069]  And basically, one by one, they did exactly what they said they were going to do.
[03:08:14.109 --> 03:08:16.890]  But during the drill, a lot more people died.
[03:08:17.481 --> 03:08:18.061]  We're good to go.
[03:08:18.081 --> 03:08:18.342]  I think?
[03:08:38.464 --> 03:08:43.326]  But you knew it was made up if you had been following this stuff for years and you saw what they did over in Singapore.
[03:08:43.346 --> 03:08:46.147]  You see, it wasn't six feet in Singapore.
[03:08:46.527 --> 03:08:48.007]  It was three feet, one meter.
[03:08:48.047 --> 03:08:48.808]  Why was that?
[03:08:49.128 --> 03:08:51.889]  Well, they had the DARPA robots roaming the streets.
[03:08:52.109 --> 03:08:58.791]  You know, Spot, the little cute robot you can get for like $35,000 to $75,000 depending on how you want it souped up.
[03:08:59.371 --> 03:09:06.814]  You know, the one that originated through military technology and the war of terror, those big dogs, that's what it became.
[03:09:07.748 --> 03:09:13.390]  And it had facial recognition and motion recognition to make sure people were staying three feet apart.
[03:09:14.191 --> 03:09:15.651]  They had more surveillance.
[03:09:15.671 --> 03:09:30.937]  So we get attacked by a bioweapon globally and hardcore in this country only for them to then attack the populace again by injecting them with a multitude of bioweapons.
[03:09:31.637 --> 03:09:33.118]  Because we do have the mRNA.
[03:09:34.269 --> 03:09:48.476]  Remember, there's that Moderna partnership, and we'll show you that right now, all the way back in 2013, okay, because they love you, with DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency.
[03:09:48.696 --> 03:09:59.022]  So from its inception, everybody, Moderna and DARPA are part of the Adept and Protect program.
[03:09:59.042 --> 03:10:03.364]  This is a military operation that then expands into
[03:10:03.979 --> 03:10:06.581]  To a ton of different strategic collaborators.
[03:10:07.261 --> 03:10:08.001]  AstraZeneca.
[03:10:08.202 --> 03:10:08.742]  Oh, my good.
[03:10:09.042 --> 03:10:09.522]  Wait a minute.
[03:10:09.542 --> 03:10:11.964]  Didn't they get to put out some of those hate and lie shots?
[03:10:12.304 --> 03:10:13.024]  Well, how about that?
[03:10:14.125 --> 03:10:14.485]  Merck.
[03:10:15.226 --> 03:10:15.846]  Vertex.
[03:10:16.206 --> 03:10:18.288]  Barta, which is the medical DARPA.
[03:10:18.868 --> 03:10:19.208]  Okay?
[03:10:19.288 --> 03:10:20.369]  And there's DARPA itself.
[03:10:20.609 --> 03:10:23.691]  And, of course, the good people at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[03:10:24.131 --> 03:10:26.333]  Institute Pastor is also in here.
[03:10:27.073 --> 03:10:28.214]  All on their own websites.
[03:10:28.794 --> 03:10:30.255]  All out in the public arena.
[03:10:30.275 --> 03:10:33.617]  So we got attacked by a bioweapon.
[03:10:34.696 --> 03:10:34.876]  I think?
[03:10:55.862 --> 03:11:00.125]  You know, I had kind of a moment where I thought to myself, I was getting ready to do my shows.
[03:11:00.145 --> 03:11:07.489]  I was thinking about what the topics were going to be with the guests they have lined up over at Making Sense of the Badness on Patriot.TV.
[03:11:07.809 --> 03:11:08.930]  That's where you can find my stuff.
[03:11:09.831 --> 03:11:12.612]  And I thought I was getting up.
[03:11:12.873 --> 03:11:15.814]  I looked in the mirror, and I just, for some reason, I'm like, am I doing enough?
[03:11:16.155 --> 03:11:16.995]  Have I done enough?
[03:11:17.856 --> 03:11:19.417]  You know, I know Alex is 50 now.
[03:11:19.517 --> 03:11:19.617]  I'm 44.
[03:11:19.757 --> 03:11:21.858]  I'm going to be 45 this year.
[03:11:22.278 --> 03:11:23.659]  And quite frankly, he's not wrong.
[03:11:23.959 --> 03:11:24.800]  I haven't done enough.
[03:11:26.127 --> 03:11:28.227]  I haven't made enough films.
[03:11:28.847 --> 03:11:31.468]  I haven't gone to enough protests.
[03:11:32.708 --> 03:11:34.368]  And he's just right about that.
[03:11:34.688 --> 03:11:36.189]  I don't know that you can do enough.
[03:11:36.629 --> 03:11:41.270]  You know, aside from, obviously you need a personal life and a social life, right?
[03:11:41.290 --> 03:11:44.550]  And the family is that strongest unit.
[03:11:44.630 --> 03:11:50.391]  There has to be a lot of, you want to create joy there in the overall family dynamic.
[03:11:50.431 --> 03:11:51.111]  That's part of it.
[03:11:51.451 --> 03:11:55.272]  There's going to be ups and downs, but you need to have attention to that, right?
[03:11:56.878 --> 03:12:06.890]  Anytime I'm just messing around or I'm partaking in something that's just a hobby at this point, it does feel kind of, you know, like I'm being selfish.
[03:12:07.030 --> 03:12:08.311]  I could absolutely do more.
[03:12:09.353 --> 03:12:09.473]  So
[03:12:10.626 --> 03:12:13.988]  You know, I just wanted to get that out of the way in this first segment.
[03:12:14.409 --> 03:12:21.954]  I just related with that comment so much because there are still people taking this stuff, and on top of it, you know, we could talk about the shedding.
[03:12:22.494 --> 03:12:24.095]  Forget about what this is.
[03:12:24.535 --> 03:12:29.599]  We could talk about the bio and geoengineering of nature all around us.
[03:12:30.359 --> 03:12:37.764]  You know, the classified and declassified programs, the government programs, and the private programs, you know, that...
[03:12:38.274 --> 03:12:39.054]  We're good to go.
[03:12:39.074 --> 03:12:39.314]  I think?
[03:13:00.379 --> 03:13:05.445]  Through these benevolent organizations like his Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[03:13:05.745 --> 03:13:08.648]  So we're going to hit that clip first and foremost.
[03:13:08.688 --> 03:13:09.169]  Let's do it.
[03:13:10.071 --> 03:13:11.753]  Well, it's pretty impressive that
[03:13:37.418 --> 03:13:53.643]  When you take these vaccines, get them to be very inexpensive by making big volume commitments, have that right relationship with the private sector, get the delivery system so they're really getting the coverage out there, you literally save millions of lives.
[03:13:54.323 --> 03:14:04.766]  And 20 years ago when we created these new multilateral organizations, Gavi for the vaccines, Global Fund for HIV, TB and Malaria, we didn't know they'd be successful.
[03:14:05.535 --> 03:14:11.284]  I'm just going to pause it there for a moment before you get to find out what the financial return on investment is.
[03:14:12.222 --> 03:14:14.103]  He just mentioned the Global Fund.
[03:14:14.123 --> 03:14:34.369]  We're going to be following this up with the Global Fund because if you think the number he put out here on what the profit margin making these vaccines is, wait till you hear what Joe Biden has to say after Bill Gates introduces him, by the way, at the Global Fund just a couple of years ago.
[03:14:34.429 --> 03:14:35.969]  But let's let Gates finish here.
[03:14:36.630 --> 03:14:41.251]  They've gone through lots of challenges about making sure the money gets there, making sure the
[03:14:41.698 --> 03:14:42.539]  We're good to go.
[03:14:42.559 --> 03:14:42.759]  I think?
[03:15:07.797 --> 03:15:10.580]  But we feel there's been over a 20 to 1 return.
[03:15:10.800 --> 03:15:17.125]  So if you just look at the economic benefits, that's a pretty strong number compared to anything else.
[03:15:17.806 --> 03:15:20.128]  Big smile right there.
[03:15:20.588 --> 03:15:21.229]  Big smile.
[03:15:21.249 --> 03:15:22.530]  Oh, the economic 20 to 1 return.
[03:15:24.398 --> 03:15:31.020]  Oh yeah, and then it's governments, your tax dollars, that are putting in the other money.
[03:15:31.060 --> 03:15:33.221]  Who's really reaping the benefits here?
[03:15:33.481 --> 03:15:39.603]  So just at an economic level, Bill Gates is licking those lips.
[03:15:39.623 --> 03:15:40.744]  When we come back...
[03:15:41.324 --> 03:15:45.747]  We're going to talk about a bigger economic return via that global fund.
[03:15:46.028 --> 03:15:47.629]  This is the Alex Jones Show.

[03:15:57.832 --> 03:15:58.052]  I think?
[03:16:20.402 --> 03:16:24.005]  So, one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[03:16:24.366 --> 03:16:25.687]  That's how our bodies work.
[03:16:25.707 --> 03:16:26.628]  They're all very diverse.
[03:16:27.008 --> 03:16:37.197]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name InfoWarsMD Good Night Sleep.

[03:16:50.942 --> 03:16:51.822]  InfoWars.com.
[03:16:57.117 --> 03:17:01.721]  29 years on air, all I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalist.
[03:17:02.442 --> 03:17:07.766]  And I've done the best job I can to tell those words that have been accurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[03:17:08.146 --> 03:17:14.591]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves, unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people.
[03:17:14.832 --> 03:17:15.512]  We don't do that.
[03:17:15.993 --> 03:17:17.874]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[03:17:18.254 --> 03:17:20.276]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product.
[03:17:20.316 --> 03:17:20.897]  It's so powerful.
[03:17:21.817 --> 03:17:31.864]  This is the breakdown product after your cells process it of folic acid, methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[03:17:32.325 --> 03:17:33.585]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[03:17:33.605 --> 03:17:34.446]  It's not a stimulant.
[03:17:34.706 --> 03:17:39.610]  It energizes your cells and then everything else you take just supercharges it.
[03:17:39.650 --> 03:17:40.470]  It's so insane.
[03:17:40.830 --> 03:17:42.351]  It's foundational energy.
[03:17:42.792 --> 03:17:44.313]  The strongest formula out there.
[03:17:46.414 --> 03:18:01.325]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[03:18:01.345 --> 03:18:02.866]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:18:03.647 --> 03:18:06.689]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:18:07.570 --> 03:18:11.513]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers...
[03:18:12.938 --> 03:18:15.663]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:18:16.484 --> 03:18:24.297]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:18:25.299 --> 03:18:28.160]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:18:28.180 --> 03:18:33.941]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:18:34.742 --> 03:18:35.642]  I know you spread the word.
[03:18:35.682 --> 03:18:37.162]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[03:18:37.202 --> 03:18:37.723]  Keep doing it.
[03:18:37.763 --> 03:18:44.384]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[03:18:44.825 --> 03:18:46.005]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[03:18:46.705 --> 03:18:50.368]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Enforce.com.
[03:18:51.008 --> 03:18:55.651]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Enforce.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:18:55.952 --> 03:18:56.812]  Please take action now.
[03:18:57.212 --> 03:19:00.935]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[03:19:01.275 --> 03:19:04.437]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[03:19:04.838 --> 03:19:09.281]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[03:19:09.921 --> 03:19:12.042]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[03:19:12.342 --> 03:19:20.327]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's You Will Eat the Bugs.
[03:19:20.968 --> 03:19:26.711]  This is The Great Awakening, the plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[03:19:27.171 --> 03:19:30.713]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[03:19:30.973 --> 03:19:33.435]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.
[03:19:33.835 --> 03:19:38.256]  Get your copy of The Great Awakening today at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:19:38.556 --> 03:19:42.038]  Either signed as a fundraiser, not thinking for the support, or unsigned.
[03:19:42.258 --> 03:19:44.358]  But whatever you do, take action now.
[03:19:44.718 --> 03:19:47.839]  We're fighting for you, but we can't keep on if you don't support us.
[03:19:48.119 --> 03:19:50.280]  So please, get the historic book now.
[03:19:50.660 --> 03:19:54.201]  Go now to InfoWarsStore.com and get The Great Awakening.
[03:19:54.441 --> 03:19:56.122]  The Great Awakening at InfoWarsStore.
[03:19:58.368 --> 03:20:04.289]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:16.434 --> 03:20:17.194]  Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:17.295 --> 03:20:18.615]  I am Jason Bermas.
[03:20:18.695 --> 03:20:21.477]  We were talking about the well-being economy.
[03:20:21.497 --> 03:20:36.246]  We just saw Gates salivating at the idea of taking global funds and making a 20 to 1 return by getting commitments to jab people with all sorts of hate and lies.
[03:20:36.566 --> 03:20:40.108]  That was Davos prior to the COVID-1984 nightmare.
[03:20:40.128 --> 03:20:40.509]  Let's go post-
[03:20:43.260 --> 03:20:45.381]  COVID-1984 nightmare.
[03:20:45.401 --> 03:20:51.825]  I mean, we're still living under it, but by this time, Biden has been installed and he can barely speak.
[03:20:52.185 --> 03:21:05.752]  Now, again, Alex made the point earlier, you know, you could play videos all day of Joe Biden looking confused and how terrible these people are and what a joke they are and have a fun broadcast in Mainline.
[03:21:06.113 --> 03:21:08.234]  And, hey, there's a time and a place for some of that.
[03:21:08.254 --> 03:21:10.115]  And we'll actually, at the very tail end,
[03:21:10.655 --> 03:21:11.577]  We're good to go.
[03:21:25.067 --> 03:21:43.074]  Is this admission that the Global Fund, remember he talked about it, HIV, TB, malaria, they pose as benevolent institutions, and we're going to have a throwback of G. Edward Griffin exposing that way back in the day, all right, for what it was.
[03:21:43.134 --> 03:21:46.376]  And now we look at what it turned into at a 30, I think a 31 to 1 return.
[03:21:50.151 --> 03:21:52.773]  Okay, and then we're going to get into SDGs.
[03:21:52.813 --> 03:21:58.196]  And when I say we, Joe Biden, who can barely speak and read off a script.
[03:21:58.216 --> 03:21:58.716]  So here it is.
[03:21:59.096 --> 03:22:03.258]  Biden and the Global Fund after being announced by Gates himself.
[03:22:03.979 --> 03:22:09.222]  We're going to work with our partners in Congress and contribute another $6 billion to the Global Fund.
[03:22:11.723 --> 03:22:16.466]  Bringing the overall global pledge as of the day to $14 billion.
[03:22:19.108 --> 03:22:28.373]  These incredible contributions have succeeded through our mutual and continuing commitment to deliver one of the largest fundraisers in global health history.
[03:22:28.973 --> 03:22:33.636]  And these billions are expected to deliver a 31-fold return on investment.
[03:22:33.656 --> 03:22:35.417]  31-fold return on investment.
[03:22:38.701 --> 03:22:52.573]  And in other words, for every dollar to fight these diseases, we expect $31 in health gains and economic returns, which also advances our progress toward meeting the goal of sustainable development agenda.
[03:22:53.273 --> 03:22:56.556]  So it's the sustainable development agenda.
[03:22:56.836 --> 03:22:57.317]  Here we go.
[03:22:57.337 --> 03:23:07.425]  To improve surveillance capabilities, build stronger, more resilient health supply chains, and increase innovations to reach those most in need.
[03:23:08.089 --> 03:23:17.098]  And it's going to help prevent and respond to gender-based violence and advance sexual and reproductive rights and health outcomes for people around the world.
[03:23:18.600 --> 03:23:21.563]  Let me translate that one for everybody, okay?
[03:23:22.228 --> 03:23:28.729]  So first of all, they're bringing in the gender agenda, making sure they're going to get their care.
[03:23:28.809 --> 03:23:32.310]  Because there's just so much gender-based violence.
[03:23:32.770 --> 03:23:33.290]  No, no, no.
[03:23:33.771 --> 03:23:42.352]  This is all about a full medical and social, cultural takeover under the guise of charity.
[03:23:42.392 --> 03:23:45.193]  And then these people are literally untouchable people.
[03:23:45.613 --> 03:23:48.975]  In any way, shape, or form criminally after the fact.
[03:23:49.195 --> 03:23:56.960]  And if you think I'm wrong about that, why is nobody in jail based on what happened in the last few years?
[03:23:57.261 --> 03:23:58.461]  Ask yourself that question.
[03:23:58.741 --> 03:24:00.342]  Let's let Mr. Biden finish up here.
[03:24:01.543 --> 03:24:03.965]  We're putting equity at the core of our efforts.
[03:24:04.585 --> 03:24:13.651]  We have to ensure that everyone, no matter who they are, who they love, where they come from, can access care and treatment they need, period.
[03:24:17.122 --> 03:24:17.703]  Now think about that.
[03:24:17.943 --> 03:24:18.984]  And this is the goofy part.
[03:24:19.024 --> 03:24:20.725]  This is where you're going to remember where this is from.
[03:24:20.745 --> 03:24:22.087]  Okay?
[03:24:26.531 --> 03:24:26.971]  There you go.
[03:24:26.991 --> 03:24:31.615]  I hope everybody enjoyed the stone cold face Joe not being able to do anything.
[03:24:31.635 --> 03:24:32.897]  But think what he said right there.
[03:24:33.917 --> 03:24:34.218]  Okay?
[03:24:34.358 --> 03:24:36.320]  That this is a global takeover.
[03:24:36.340 --> 03:24:39.743]  You know, we talk about how these people want your children.
[03:24:40.279 --> 03:24:50.862]  But what they really want is government in every aspect of every human life and the regimentation of all human beings and really biological life in general.
[03:24:50.882 --> 03:24:54.983]  That's why carbon has been chosen.
[03:24:56.224 --> 03:25:01.285]  Because we are carbon-based and so is every other biological life form.
[03:25:02.034 --> 03:25:05.957]  Now, I want to talk about some of this public-private partnership, because this is well-being.
[03:25:06.237 --> 03:25:08.079]  We want to get shots to everybody.
[03:25:08.139 --> 03:25:09.000]  Everybody's making money.
[03:25:09.020 --> 03:25:10.120]  Forget about 20 to 1.
[03:25:10.761 --> 03:25:11.662]  Just a few years.
[03:25:11.962 --> 03:25:13.363]  It's 31 to 1.
[03:25:13.543 --> 03:25:14.364]  Get in here.
[03:25:14.764 --> 03:25:16.746]  Let's further legitimize the criminals.
[03:25:17.506 --> 03:25:22.290]  Now, a lot of other people got in on the party once this got going.
[03:25:22.670 --> 03:25:26.273]  So when they were looking for a vaccine and partners, I just want to show you this clip.
[03:25:26.733 --> 03:25:27.034]  IBM!
[03:25:27.254 --> 03:25:27.334]  IBM!
[03:25:28.859 --> 03:25:37.412]  You know, the good people at IBM, if you want to look up a thing called IBM and the Holocaust, you might be surprised at what you find.
[03:25:37.773 --> 03:25:39.115]  But let's check out this clip right here.
[03:25:39.750 --> 03:25:48.778]  And just a note tonight, tech company IBM and Moderna, the pharmaceutical company, are joining forces in the race to speed up this vaccination process.
[03:25:49.259 --> 03:25:57.446]  The two are looking to use artificial intelligence and blockchain, that's a data storing system, to help improve vaccine distribution.
[03:25:57.466 --> 03:25:58.527]  Exciting stuff.
[03:25:59.027 --> 03:26:01.209]  Some blockchain technology, too.
[03:26:02.030 --> 03:26:02.470]  How about that?
[03:26:02.510 --> 03:26:05.133]  And then I would be remiss, as you can see above me,
[03:26:05.845 --> 03:26:15.948]  If I did not mention that Tesla teamed up with CureVac to make the RNA micro factories to print up the shots.
[03:26:16.889 --> 03:26:18.189]  And why is that important?
[03:26:18.349 --> 03:26:23.231]  Well, again, this is about the regimentation of all life on the planet.
[03:26:23.271 --> 03:26:30.093]  And you notice Joe also mentioned during the Global Fund surveillance and surveillance capabilities.
[03:26:30.703 --> 03:26:46.529]  Well, one of the biggest surveillance slash communications capabilities that's out there right now being utilized by the military is Starlink and its DARPA partner that gets launched by SpaceX, Blackjack, that program.
[03:26:47.385 --> 03:26:54.508]  And here's John Kerry, ghoul of all ghouls, Mr. Climate Change Agenda, Mr. Humanity is the problem.
[03:26:54.528 --> 03:27:01.671]  Because again, they haven't been shy, and we're going to get to a clip from the Club of Rome, 1973, and their first artificial intelligence incident.
[03:27:03.852 --> 03:27:04.933]  We're good to go.
[03:27:04.953 --> 03:27:05.193]  I think?
[03:27:33.885 --> 03:27:34.365]  We're good to go.
[03:28:02.813 --> 03:28:03.053]  Thank you.
[03:28:20.211 --> 03:28:23.493]  I mean he even throws the climate crisis stuff in there.
[03:28:23.513 --> 03:28:25.053]  I want you to think of what he's saying right there.
[03:28:25.093 --> 03:28:31.176]  That is the public-private partnership that already exists.
[03:28:31.336 --> 03:28:35.278]  It is the very definition of fascism.
[03:28:35.758 --> 03:28:37.260]  We know someone else is going to pay for it.
[03:28:37.420 --> 03:28:40.024]  The government, we're going to do it.
[03:28:40.044 --> 03:28:44.970]  When we come back, we're going to bring Klaus Nutschwab into the game.
[03:28:45.030 --> 03:28:49.716]  He's going to tell you about the well-being economy and crushing the individual.
[03:28:49.736 --> 03:28:50.958]  It's all about collectivism.
[03:28:51.158 --> 03:28:54.001]  This is the Alex Jones Show, Infowarsstore.com.
[03:28:56.593 --> 03:29:07.115]  Naturally sourced from the finest hemp plants in America, Rebelzen offers the absolute finest quality CBD available and at the lowest prices.
[03:29:08.155 --> 03:29:22.738]  Extracted using a cold-pressed technique to retain the molecular integrity of the cannabinoids and terpenes within the plant, this full-spectrum formula ensures that your nervous system gets the full benefits of CBD.
[03:29:23.958 --> 03:29:33.884]  Premium quality organic CBD, like Rebel Zen, has been shown to naturally reduce anxiety, relieve pain, and decrease inflammation.
[03:29:34.364 --> 03:29:41.969]  People have reported a reduction in symptoms of insomnia, arthritis, seizures, chronic pain, and epilepsy.
[03:29:42.469 --> 03:29:49.093]  Several studies have shown it helps to reduce cortisol, increase serotonin, and boost vitality.
[03:29:49.973 --> 03:30:02.772]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the global agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[03:30:04.085 --> 03:30:17.093]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections, masquerading as vaccines.
[03:30:17.993 --> 03:30:22.195]  It is so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives oblivious.
[03:30:23.536 --> 03:30:26.318]  And you realize ignorance is not bliss, it equals death.
[03:30:27.904 --> 03:30:48.337]  But people are starting to really understand how serious things are, and that's a hard thing to do, because to wake up to a disturbing reality and realize that we're in the middle of a giant biological weapons war against humanity, and that there's mass sterilization that's already taking place, and they're cutting off all the major energy sources, is really hard to deal with, but it's the reality.
[03:30:48.897 --> 03:30:53.080]  Facing it is our only chance to turn this around, because stuff's about to get really, really nasty.
[03:30:53.480 --> 03:30:54.121]  Infowars.com
[03:30:56.562 --> 03:31:02.029]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[03:31:02.770 --> 03:31:07.056]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[03:31:07.457 --> 03:31:11.843]  We finally have a limited run back in supply at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:31:13.264 --> 03:31:16.007]  So many people have serious issues.
[03:31:16.308 --> 03:31:17.449]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[03:31:17.889 --> 03:31:23.295]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[03:31:23.836 --> 03:31:29.242]  Most of their iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[03:31:29.862 --> 03:31:33.066]  But this is pure atomic certified iodine.
[03:31:34.514 --> 03:31:34.814]  I don't.
[03:31:35.454 --> 03:31:38.515]  X2 is now back in stock, discounted.
[03:31:38.855 --> 03:31:42.036]  So I'm giving Thanksgiving right now for this product being here.
[03:31:42.376 --> 03:31:47.478]  It funds the InfoWar, but I guarantee you, you take this for a few weeks, you will feel the difference.
[03:31:47.638 --> 03:31:48.438]  It is amazing.
[03:31:48.758 --> 03:31:49.638]  It's the missing link.
[03:31:49.918 --> 03:31:52.799]  X2, back in stock at the end of 2023 at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:31:52.819 --> 03:31:52.839]  X2.
[03:31:56.360 --> 03:31:58.922]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a war against the globalist.
[03:31:59.282 --> 03:32:01.644]  And people can't identify who's a patriot and who isn't.
[03:32:01.964 --> 03:32:05.126]  We want to identify as pro-human and anti-globalist.
[03:32:05.166 --> 03:32:08.088]  We want to let people know we're 1776 Part 2.
[03:32:08.328 --> 03:32:18.916]  That's why I designed this amazing 1776 red, white, and blue Gadsden flag shirt so you can support the Infowar and meet like-minded people everywhere when you wear it.
[03:32:19.036 --> 03:32:24.641]  When you wear these shirts, it creates an amazing amount of energy and it's quite the adventure.

[03:32:49.080 --> 03:32:54.924]  Spread the word, meet like-minded people, and fund the 1776 revolution worldwide.
[03:32:58.847 --> 03:33:04.731]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:12.487 --> 03:33:13.145]  We're good.
[03:33:14.486 --> 03:33:15.227]  And we are back.
[03:33:15.287 --> 03:33:17.408]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.468 --> 03:33:41.263]  And before we get to this clip of Klaus Schwab talking about what the well-being economy is and how dangerous the individual is, you know, the single person and what that means, I want to talk about other words that we use a lot, whether it is globalism, okay, or global government or global governance.
[03:33:41.543 --> 03:33:43.244]  We talk about socialism.
[03:33:43.897 --> 03:33:49.146]  All right, if we talk about communism, what are all these things at the end of the day?
[03:33:49.166 --> 03:33:51.510]  They're forms of collectivism.
[03:33:52.470 --> 03:34:02.554]  And collectivism in many ways eviscerates individual rights that are not granted by the state or those in power.
[03:34:02.594 --> 03:34:05.735]  Instead, they are granted by the creator.
[03:34:05.795 --> 03:34:18.059]  No matter what creator you may believe in, or if you believe in that creator at all, you are inherently given these God-given rights, these freedoms we all talk about.
[03:34:18.739 --> 03:34:27.283]  And when Klaus talks about this well-being economy, they want to crush those freedoms on a level most cannot imagine.
[03:34:27.623 --> 03:34:29.464]  So this clip's not really a big one.
[03:34:29.484 --> 03:34:31.445]  A lot of people haven't put it out there.
[03:34:31.465 --> 03:34:33.186]  It's about two minutes long.
[03:34:33.206 --> 03:34:34.066]  Let's play it.
[03:34:35.177 --> 03:34:52.882]  We have the capability to create a humankind which is more socially oriented, which is more creative, maybe more artistic, which moves much more from the notion of creating material worlds to creating well-being.
[03:34:53.302 --> 03:34:58.404]  And well-being is more than just material satisfaction.
[03:34:58.464 --> 03:35:01.845]  It can create a humankind which is healthier,
[03:35:02.950 --> 03:35:04.871]  So let's just stop it right there.
[03:35:04.891 --> 03:35:08.592]  Because I want to really, again, interpret what he just said.
[03:35:08.652 --> 03:35:11.233]  First of all, this promise of everybody living longer.
[03:35:11.293 --> 03:35:12.253]  Heard that one before.
[03:35:29.833 --> 03:35:31.134]  Heard that one growing up again.
[03:35:31.154 --> 03:35:35.498]  We were going to eradicate cancer by the time I was like, forget about 44.
[03:35:35.738 --> 03:35:37.700]  I'm 44 years young.
[03:35:37.840 --> 03:35:39.902]  By the time I was like 30, we got this.
[03:35:40.402 --> 03:35:42.183]  People are going to live to 100 plus.
[03:35:42.484 --> 03:35:46.267]  These promises are completely and totally empty.
[03:35:46.287 --> 03:35:47.508]  And think about what he says.
[03:35:47.668 --> 03:35:52.432]  We're going to move you away from making things, creating things.
[03:35:52.965 --> 03:35:56.148]  Now that is a scary notion.
[03:35:56.568 --> 03:35:59.530]  Instead, it's all going to be about health and well-being.
[03:35:59.570 --> 03:36:00.291]  What does that mean?
[03:36:01.372 --> 03:36:07.497]  Look at the health and well-being they have brought us through this pharmaceutical industrial complex.
[03:36:07.697 --> 03:36:10.659]  That worked arm-in-arm with the military industrial complex.
[03:36:10.899 --> 03:36:20.667]  Go look into what was really going on with MKUltra and academic institutions and private pharmaceutical companies.
[03:36:21.588 --> 03:36:21.928]  All right?
[03:36:22.682 --> 03:36:23.583]  That's the reality.
[03:36:23.603 --> 03:36:24.804]  So what is that well-being?
[03:36:25.504 --> 03:36:34.371]  Well, a drugged and surveilled populace through any means necessary for the collective, for a relatively healthy life.
[03:36:34.791 --> 03:36:40.075]  We're going to be concerned so much with your health, just like they were during the COVID-1984 nightmare.
[03:36:40.095 --> 03:36:44.858]  And, you know, what's going to stop us from being healthy?
[03:36:45.078 --> 03:36:50.062]  And by the way, guys, I can't emphasize this enough, and it needs to be talked about more and more.
[03:36:51.718 --> 03:36:58.563]  Every time I turn on a video online and there's some kind of commercial, it is for better health now.
[03:36:59.304 --> 03:37:10.191]  They are trying so hard to sell my generation, the younger generation, on some kind of automated psychological health care online.
[03:37:12.093 --> 03:37:13.033]  That's where we're at.
[03:37:13.334 --> 03:37:15.295]  That's the kind of well-being we like to dish out.
[03:37:16.090 --> 03:37:17.190]  AI is a real thing.
[03:37:17.630 --> 03:37:19.351]  Digital people are real things.
[03:37:19.671 --> 03:37:26.072]  In the next five years, that could be commercialized to the level you think you're talking to a person, you're spilling your guts out.
[03:37:26.292 --> 03:37:27.652]  It's 100% AI.
[03:37:28.472 --> 03:37:36.493]  But in order to do those things, we've got to crush individual speech and individual rights because individuals are the problem.
[03:37:36.533 --> 03:37:37.014]  Right, Klaus?
[03:37:38.274 --> 03:37:45.375]  But social technologies have risks, and so is particularly one risk,
[03:37:47.722 --> 03:37:50.143]  Which I want to mention.
[03:37:50.183 --> 03:37:55.427]  Those new technologies provide asymmetric power to individuals.
[03:37:56.628 --> 03:38:01.231]  So, I'm not now talking in detail what it means.
[03:38:01.951 --> 03:38:03.552]  You all can imagine.
[03:38:03.933 --> 03:38:09.056]  But it means that individuals can do a lot of harm.
[03:38:10.057 --> 03:38:11.077]  Individuals.
[03:38:11.097 --> 03:38:11.898]  Super-villains exist.
[03:38:15.450 --> 03:38:27.294]  And because supervillains exist, we have to control every aspect of your life and you're going to submit for your well-being in the new well-being economy.
[03:38:28.735 --> 03:38:42.260]  So we have to make sure that we, how shall I say, that we combat those individuals and that we shape the future in such a way that we use the potential of the new people.
[03:38:43.636 --> 03:38:47.921]  We have to be aware of the risks and we have to prepare ourselves for stress.
[03:38:47.941 --> 03:38:49.762]  That's all what the forum is doing.
[03:38:50.803 --> 03:38:58.431]  Just to give you a concrete... It's not only in our minds that we are doing something.
[03:38:58.831 --> 03:39:01.314]  We opened a center of
[03:39:01.977 --> 03:39:30.033]  For the first industrial revolution in San Francisco, and I will have tomorrow discussions also with the government to see how we can engage with them, to look at the technological progress, but at the same time at the societal effects, and to develop standards and protocols to make sure that those technologies are used for the benefit of mankind and not as destructive weapons.
[03:39:30.653 --> 03:39:32.815]  God has destructive weapons.
[03:39:32.855 --> 03:39:34.436]  Well, let's think about what he just said.
[03:39:34.456 --> 03:39:37.658]  Because he mentioned Israel and how it could be utilized.
[03:39:38.139 --> 03:39:47.185]  Now, during COVID-1984, the Israeli people were some of the most heavily and forcibly vaccinated out there.
[03:39:47.405 --> 03:39:48.386]  And Netanyahu...
[03:39:49.409 --> 03:39:50.549]  Came out and said, you know what?
[03:39:50.969 --> 03:39:58.851]  We've got a 98% record of all of our citizens over the last 20 years of their medical records.
[03:39:59.331 --> 03:40:05.132]  We're also going for a genetic database of that nature.
[03:40:05.152 --> 03:40:09.733]  And now I want to remind people, they had the vaccine passports.
[03:40:09.753 --> 03:40:10.773]  You want to go to the store?
[03:40:10.793 --> 03:40:11.733]  Uh-uh-uh.
[03:40:12.073 --> 03:40:13.513]  Not without your passport.
[03:40:13.533 --> 03:40:15.994]  I mean, those were some of the...
[03:40:16.940 --> 03:40:25.228]  That's what's scary about that nation on top of the Palestinian situation, where you literally have, again, AI, and we're about to get into AI.
[03:40:25.508 --> 03:40:27.870]  Klaus is big on AI, right?
[03:40:29.232 --> 03:40:37.219]  When you have automated systems making decisions, and they have the sharpshooter with less lethal munitions at some of these checkpoints.
[03:40:37.459 --> 03:40:38.080]  Sharpshooter.
[03:40:38.420 --> 03:40:39.101]  Look into it.
[03:40:39.901 --> 03:40:40.261]  Quick!
[03:40:40.701 --> 03:40:52.485]  I got this clip of G. Edward Griffin calling these tax-exempt charitable foundations out way back in the day, and this is the guy that talks about rugged individualism.
[03:40:54.366 --> 03:40:59.128]  The story you are about to hear represents a missing piece in the puzzle of modern history.
[03:40:59.948 --> 03:41:05.090]  Without this knowledge, many contemporary events are simply beyond understanding.
[03:41:05.993 --> 03:41:16.502]  You're about to hear a man tell you that the major tax-exempt foundations of this land, since at least 1945, have been operating to promote a hidden agenda.
[03:41:17.563 --> 03:41:23.067]  And that agenda has nothing to do with the surface appearance of charity, good works, or philanthropy.
[03:41:25.089 --> 03:41:32.055]  This man will tell you that the real objectives include the creation of a worldwide collective estate, including the Soviet Union,
[03:41:32.757 --> 03:41:39.163]  Which is to be ruled from behind the scenes by those same interests which now control the tax-exempt foundations.
[03:41:41.284 --> 03:41:57.999]  The man who tells this story is none other than Mr. Norman Dodd, who in 1954 was the staff director of the Congressional Special Committee to Investigate Tax-Exempt Foundations, sometimes referred to as the Reese Committee, in recognition of its chairman, Congressman Carol Reese.
[03:41:59.989 --> 03:42:03.172]  The interview you are about to see was conducted by me in 1982.
[03:42:04.773 --> 03:42:11.579]  I had no immediate use for the material at that time, but I realized that Mr. Dodd's story was of extreme importance.
[03:42:12.220 --> 03:42:19.987]  And since he was advanced in age and not in good health, I simply wanted to capture his recollections on videotape while he was still with us.
[03:42:20.894 --> 03:42:25.539]  Now, obviously, we're not going to play that interview, but that's the OG right there.
[03:42:26.140 --> 03:42:28.582]  G. Edward Griffin is the man.
[03:42:29.023 --> 03:42:39.174]  The man that exposed Jekyll Island, the banking systems, the roundtable groups, the modus operandi of this collectivist movement.
[03:42:40.495 --> 03:42:41.816]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:41.916 --> 03:42:43.236]  I am Jason Bermas.

[03:43:57.003 --> 03:44:02.305]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing, high-quality coffee has not been available.
[03:44:02.765 --> 03:44:07.126]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[03:44:07.586 --> 03:44:10.047]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[03:44:10.607 --> 03:44:20.010]  But now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.
[03:44:20.190 --> 03:44:22.831]  It's powered by the company, Minuteman Coffee.

[03:44:58.581 --> 03:44:59.842]  Gunther in Tennessee.
[03:44:59.882 --> 03:45:00.862]  Thanks for calling, Gunther.
[03:45:00.882 --> 03:45:01.423]  Hey, Alex.
[03:45:01.623 --> 03:45:02.363]  First time caller.
[03:45:02.443 --> 03:45:04.304]  Real quick, wanted to plug your foundational energy.
[03:45:04.845 --> 03:45:05.805]  Just started taking that.
[03:45:06.485 --> 03:45:10.768]  And, boy, three pills, recommended dose, I was bouncing off the walls.
[03:45:10.908 --> 03:45:16.531]  But I'll tell you, foundational is the right name for that product because I'll cut down to one.
[03:45:17.131 --> 03:45:21.394]  It's like you have a baseline of energy that you were missing before that you got back.
[03:45:21.514 --> 03:45:21.634]  Cool.
[03:45:21.834 --> 03:45:30.058]  Well, I'm glad you mentioned that because it's methylfolate, the breakdown of folic acid, and a lot of people, particularly Europeans, don't absorb all of the folic acid.
[03:45:30.298 --> 03:45:31.379]  So it's not a stimulant.
[03:45:31.599 --> 03:45:35.021]  It's a totally natural thing that boosts energy that's foundational.
[03:45:35.301 --> 03:45:37.862]  And was I lying to you or did it not work?
[03:45:38.562 --> 03:45:39.763]  No, it was top-notch.
[03:45:39.803 --> 03:45:43.425]  And I was actually taking Red Pill Plus before, and that's got a little folic acid in it.
[03:45:43.485 --> 03:45:47.267]  I think there was a little buildup from this, but the energy from this was no jitters.
[03:45:47.447 --> 03:45:48.387]  I mean, it's top-notch.
[03:45:48.468 --> 03:45:49.168]  It's a great product.
[03:45:49.605 --> 03:45:50.546]  Well, thank you so much.
[03:45:50.606 --> 03:45:50.926]  Yeah, no.
[03:45:51.026 --> 03:45:54.350]  Folic acid's great and it's in real red pill, but some can't break it down.
[03:45:54.390 --> 03:45:55.410]  This is the breakdown of it.
[03:45:55.471 --> 03:45:56.231]  That's exactly it.
[03:45:58.033 --> 03:46:01.156]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:46:01.176 --> 03:46:02.777]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:46:03.478 --> 03:46:06.541]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:46:07.422 --> 03:46:11.345]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers...
[03:46:12.788 --> 03:46:15.489]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:46:16.330 --> 03:46:22.253]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[03:46:23.213 --> 03:46:24.134]  It's really just incredible.
[03:46:25.143 --> 03:46:28.045]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:46:28.766 --> 03:46:33.790]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:46:34.570 --> 03:46:35.491]  I know you spread the word.
[03:46:35.531 --> 03:46:37.012]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[03:46:37.052 --> 03:46:37.573]  Keep doing it.
[03:46:37.613 --> 03:46:45.899]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[03:46:46.540 --> 03:46:50.143]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:46:50.843 --> 03:46:55.467]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWars.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:46:55.787 --> 03:46:56.668]  Please take action now.
[03:46:58.509 --> 03:47:04.433]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:13.080 --> 03:47:14.061]  And we are back.
[03:47:14.221 --> 03:47:16.102]  Final segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:16.182 --> 03:47:18.224]  I am Jason Burmess, and...
[03:47:18.860 --> 03:47:40.332]  We're going to shift gears all the way back to the Club of Rome in 1973 because the idea of Malthusianism and population control and this neo-feudal idea that, again, there's a class above us, this scumbag predator class that gets to decide everything because they know what's best.
[03:47:40.372 --> 03:47:43.093]  They're mommy and daddy, and we just have to go along with it.
[03:47:43.113 --> 03:47:44.774]  It's been around for a very long time.
[03:47:45.518 --> 03:47:53.465]  But this was a rebranding through, again, the benevolent idea that pollution was bad and there were too many people on the planet.
[03:47:53.485 --> 03:47:58.729]  So even back in the day with the Club of Rome, people were the problem.
[03:47:58.990 --> 03:48:02.733]  But don't take other people and scientists' word for it.
[03:48:03.213 --> 03:48:05.876]  Let's take a machine's word for it.
[03:48:06.456 --> 03:48:07.317]  And this is where we were...
[03:48:08.078 --> 03:48:19.345]  Shifting gears to what we are now in with AI and that hype and how we have to be obedient to it and what it's going to actually choose our leaders and our direction for us.
[03:48:19.906 --> 03:48:27.290]  The original AI, we're essentially saying 2020, that's peak civilization at best.
[03:48:27.330 --> 03:48:29.312]  Things are going to get really rotten around that time.
[03:48:29.352 --> 03:48:33.274]  By 2040, 2050, all of civilization is done.
[03:48:33.314 --> 03:48:34.395]  You can't make this up.
[03:48:35.081 --> 03:48:35.942]  We're good to go.
[03:48:36.062 --> 03:48:36.283]  I think?
[03:48:54.770 --> 03:48:58.213]  Has said that to solve climate change we need a carbon tax.
[03:48:58.293 --> 03:49:00.574]  I couldn't disagree more.
[03:49:00.634 --> 03:49:05.438]  A carbon tax would be really the end of us and more of that total control.
[03:49:05.838 --> 03:49:15.365]  Well, let's watch this old school news clip on the Club of Rome and their AI, everybody, and how we're bad as human beings.
[03:49:17.787 --> 03:49:21.970]  The program called World One doesn't pretend to be a precise forecast.
[03:49:22.546 --> 03:49:27.609]  What it does for the first time in man's history on the planet is to look at the world as one system.
[03:49:28.170 --> 03:49:33.873]  It shows that Earth cannot sustain present population and industrial growth for much more than a few decades.
[03:49:34.513 --> 03:49:40.417]  It shows that simply cleaning up our car exhausts and making some small effort to limit our families simply isn't enough.
[03:49:42.278 --> 03:49:48.082]  It's like an electronic guided tour of our global behavior since 1900 and where that behavior will lead us.
[03:49:50.003 --> 03:49:54.166]  Well, this is the printed version of what we've just seen on the television screen.
[03:49:54.586 --> 03:50:07.934]  What looks at first to be just a maze of computer characteristics is really a system of very simple graphs which project what's going to happen to the planet over the next 150 years if we don't do something drastic to stop it.
[03:50:08.735 --> 03:50:11.877]  Now again, we're talking early 70s here.
[03:50:12.597 --> 03:50:17.400]  You already said in three decades, if we don't clean up our act and limit our growth, our family...
[03:50:18.137 --> 03:50:19.638]  Everybody needs to look at the limits of growth.
[03:50:19.938 --> 03:50:21.599]  It's all over!
[03:50:21.619 --> 03:50:22.920]  We're done!
[03:50:22.940 --> 03:50:24.401]  Ah!
[03:50:24.461 --> 03:50:25.882]  The sky is falling!
[03:50:25.922 --> 03:50:28.624]  The academics and the computer have told us so.
[03:50:29.124 --> 03:50:29.985]  But let them continue.
[03:50:33.155 --> 03:50:36.257]  Down the left-hand side of the graph is the date.
[03:50:36.577 --> 03:50:40.019]  1900, 1940, 1980, 2020, right down to 2060.
[03:50:40.059 --> 03:50:49.824]  Now, each of these lines of letters represents a curve showing some aspect of the condition of the planet.
[03:50:50.644 --> 03:50:54.587]  The further out this way they go, the greater that figure is.
[03:50:54.787 --> 03:50:56.828]  The further this way, the less.
[03:50:57.188 --> 03:50:59.469]  For example, P represents population.
[03:50:59.649 --> 03:51:00.110]  So here it is at 1900.
[03:51:01.320 --> 03:51:04.002]  And then it comes up to 1940, it starts to take off.
[03:51:04.443 --> 03:51:09.527]  Here we are at 1980, up to the turn of the century, and then it starts to peter off.
[03:51:10.567 --> 03:51:14.871]  Let's now have a look at this next curve, the Q curve, which is the quality of life.
[03:51:14.911 --> 03:51:22.957]  And this is represented by, for example, the amount of space people have, the amount of money they have to spend, the amount of food they have to eat.
[03:51:24.138 --> 03:51:27.501]  Now, it increases rapidly up to 1940, but from 1940 on, the quality of life
[03:51:31.019 --> 03:51:31.539]  Diminishes.
[03:51:32.140 --> 03:51:38.003]  And here we are about the turn of the century and we come up to the year 2020 and it's really come right back.
[03:51:39.504 --> 03:51:44.507]  So 2020, you know, our standard of living, yikes.
[03:51:45.267 --> 03:51:51.571]  But really during the Trump administration, especially in this country, the standard of living was at a very high point.
[03:51:51.591 --> 03:51:52.831]  It was actually coming back.
[03:51:53.432 --> 03:51:53.872]  But you see...
[03:51:54.511 --> 03:52:11.385]  That overall downgrade, that's very real, but that's real because of post-World War II consolidation of power and globalization through groups like this, really the military-industrial complex and beyond that we were warned about via Eisenhower.
[03:52:11.665 --> 03:52:18.851]  Let's let them go for just a little bit longer, and then I've got this clip from Sin City I really want to play.
[03:52:19.531 --> 03:52:21.253]  People, of course, means that you...
[03:52:22.043 --> 03:52:24.464]  Start to chew up your supply of natural resources.
[03:52:24.804 --> 03:52:36.487]  And this is this curve here, the N curve, that shows that slowly but steadily, the pool of natural wealth in the world, natural resources, minerals, oil, and so on, is slowly but steadily diminishing.
[03:52:37.087 --> 03:52:38.308]  So this is the situation.
[03:52:38.628 --> 03:52:44.589]  As population increases, the quality of life decreases, and the supply of natural resources decreases.
[03:52:45.169 --> 03:52:46.390]  But have a look at this curve here.
[03:52:47.150 --> 03:52:49.991]  This is called the Z curve, and it represents pollution.
[03:52:51.201 --> 03:52:57.205]  Now, predictably enough, as the population increases up to 1980, pollution increases.
[03:52:57.845 --> 03:52:58.586]  There's more rubbish.
[03:52:59.306 --> 03:53:03.409]  But from 1980 to the year 2020, pollution really takes off.
[03:53:03.769 --> 03:53:05.950]  This is assuming, of course, that we don't do anything about it.
[03:53:06.411 --> 03:53:11.574]  So the year 2020, the condition of the planet starts to become highly critical.
[03:53:11.914 --> 03:53:14.596]  And if we don't do anything about it, this is what's going to happen.
[03:53:15.336 --> 03:53:19.379]  The quality of life is going to go right back to practically zero.
[03:53:20.535 --> 03:53:26.257]  Pollution is going to become so serious right out here that it will start to kill people.
[03:53:27.418 --> 03:53:29.198]  So the population will diminish.
[03:53:30.959 --> 03:53:31.639]  Right back here.
[03:53:31.699 --> 03:53:33.380]  Less than it was in the year 1900.
[03:53:34.160 --> 03:53:42.903]  So this idea, again, we're killing the planet and then we're going to die if we don't do something has been around for a very long time.
[03:53:43.503 --> 03:53:45.264]  This clip right here that we're about to play.
[03:53:45.970 --> 03:53:46.710]  We're good to go.
[03:54:13.200 --> 03:54:13.680]  Okay?
[03:54:14.280 --> 03:54:16.341]  And I'm just going to let it play from there.
[03:54:16.901 --> 03:54:20.942]  You know, there's a little coarse language, no F-bombs or S-bombs, anything like that.
[03:54:21.422 --> 03:54:25.003]  But we've got to watch this start to finish, and I'll close out the show.
[03:54:35.566 --> 03:54:36.386]  Evening, officer.
[03:54:36.406 --> 03:54:40.767]  I don't have to introduce myself, do I?
[03:54:42.014 --> 03:54:42.994]  You read the papers?
[03:54:43.694 --> 03:54:44.815]  It's been an election year.
[03:54:44.855 --> 03:54:46.275]  You've seen plenty of my picture.
[03:54:47.315 --> 03:54:49.436]  You know who I am, what I can do.
[03:54:51.036 --> 03:54:52.316]  I'm doing you, Hartigan.
[03:54:53.796 --> 03:54:55.597]  Cold and hard, I'm doing you.
[03:54:56.737 --> 03:54:58.037]  You blew my son's ear off.
[03:55:00.418 --> 03:55:01.378]  Blew his arm off.
[03:55:01.398 --> 03:55:04.899]  You even blew his nuts and his pecker off.
[03:55:07.639 --> 03:55:09.000]  He's in a cold right now.
[03:55:09.020 --> 03:55:10.400]  They say he may never come out of it.
[03:55:11.604 --> 03:55:12.405]  My boy.
[03:55:12.425 --> 03:55:20.009]  He could have been the first rock to become the president of the United States, but you went and turned him into a brain-damaged, dickless freak.
[03:55:21.050 --> 03:55:23.071]  Pulling that trigger make you feel powerful.
[03:55:25.273 --> 03:55:28.535]  Power don't come from a badge or a gun.
[03:55:30.296 --> 03:55:31.297]  Power comes from lying.
[03:55:31.317 --> 03:55:36.260]  Lying big and getting the whole damn world to play along with you.
[03:55:37.981 --> 03:55:42.644]  Once you got everybody agreeing with what they know and their hearts ain't true, you got them by the balls.
[03:55:43.625 --> 03:55:47.227]  This wife may be 500 people in this hospital.
[03:55:51.330 --> 03:55:54.712]  I could pump you full of bullets right now and I wouldn't even be arrested.
[03:55:55.753 --> 03:55:57.114]  Everyone would lie for me.
[03:55:57.554 --> 03:55:58.455]  Everyone who counts.
[03:55:58.935 --> 03:56:04.139]  Otherwise all their own lies, everything that runs in the city, it all comes tumbling down like a pack of cards.
[03:56:06.495 --> 03:56:12.238]  But I want you firm and fit and healthy.
[03:56:12.838 --> 03:56:18.281]  I'm even putting up cash of my own to get you more surgery to fix that heart condition of yours.
[03:56:18.321 --> 03:56:23.083]  You're going to keep on living a long time.
[03:56:23.103 --> 03:56:24.043]  I'll make sure of that.
[03:56:26.284 --> 03:56:31.127]  You're going to be convicted of raping that little brat and shooting my boy.
[03:56:31.147 --> 03:56:36.009]  And you're going to spend the rest of your life in prison, disgraced, destroyed
[03:56:49.576 --> 03:56:53.818]  And those are really the type of people that they put in power.
[03:56:53.878 --> 03:56:58.040]  Think about what that guy just said, the mayor of Sin City.
[03:56:58.660 --> 03:57:00.681]  You know, that movie's incredible.
[03:57:01.221 --> 03:57:04.222]  The comic book graphic novel series is even better.
[03:57:04.282 --> 03:57:06.363]  I can't recommend them enough.
[03:57:06.423 --> 03:57:08.944]  I want to let everybody know I'm a documentary filmmaker.
[03:57:09.304 --> 03:57:10.625]  All of my documentary films
[03:57:11.265 --> 03:57:11.986]  We're good to go.
[03:57:32.708 --> 03:57:33.228]  The truth.
[03:57:33.609 --> 03:57:37.952]  By getting that out, share the links, share the information.
[03:57:38.232 --> 03:57:39.173]  Don't look to others.
[03:57:39.193 --> 03:57:40.414]  You've got to be your own hero.
[03:57:40.654 --> 03:57:41.735]  Guys, it's not about left or right.
[03:57:41.775 --> 03:57:42.796]  It's always about right and wrong.
[03:57:43.036 --> 03:57:45.738]  I absolutely love you guys, and I'll see you on the flip side.
[03:57:47.110 --> 03:57:51.372]  99 years on air, all I've wanted to do was warn the people about the globalists.
[03:57:52.092 --> 03:57:57.415]  And I've done the best job I can to tell the truth and the inaccurate, and we are on record as the most accurate there are.
[03:57:57.795 --> 03:58:04.258]  And I've tried to sell products to fund ourselves, unlike other communist revolutionaries that rob banks and kidnap people.
[03:58:04.478 --> 03:58:05.158]  We don't do that.
[03:58:05.619 --> 03:58:07.519]  We try to bring you products that really work.
[03:58:07.900 --> 03:58:09.921]  And ladies and gentlemen, I'm scared of this product.
[03:58:09.941 --> 03:58:10.541]  It's so powerful.
[03:58:11.462 --> 03:58:16.467]  This is the breakdown product after your cells process it of folic acid.
[03:58:17.048 --> 03:58:21.533]  Methylfolate with high quality organic B-complex.
[03:58:21.993 --> 03:58:23.214]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[03:58:23.254 --> 03:58:24.115]  It's not a stimulant.
[03:58:24.576 --> 03:58:26.178]  It energizes your cells.
[03:58:26.738 --> 03:58:29.259]  And then everything else you take just supercharges it.
[03:58:29.279 --> 03:58:30.120]  It's so insane.
[03:58:30.460 --> 03:58:31.981]  It's foundational energy.
[03:58:32.441 --> 03:58:36.583]  The strongest formula out there at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:58:36.963 --> 03:58:39.824]  It doesn't just energize this operation against the tyrants.
[03:58:39.904 --> 03:58:41.005]  It energizes you.
[03:58:41.285 --> 03:58:42.706]  Get foundational energy now.
[03:58:47.594 --> 03:58:50.495]  Have you tried taking the real red pill?

[03:58:56.737 --> 03:59:01.398]  One of the most powerful ingredients in the real red pill plus is pregnenolone.
[03:59:01.658 --> 03:59:09.581]  Pregnenolone levels decrease with age, and low levels are associated with fatigue, low brain function, and unhealthy aging.
[03:59:09.801 --> 03:59:17.745]  The Real Red Pill Plus also provides essential trace minerals such as vitamin B12, calcium, copper, and zinc.
