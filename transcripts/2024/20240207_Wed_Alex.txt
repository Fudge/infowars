[00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:24.153]  On January 16th of 1991, as the Soviet Union was collapsing and the Cold War coming to an end, George H.W.
[00:00:24.213 --> 00:00:31.176]  Bush publicly announced a new campaign of American dominance, which he called the New World Order.
[00:00:32.116 --> 00:00:34.137]  This is an historic moment.
[00:00:35.338 --> 00:00:42.681]  We have, in this past year, made great progress in ending the long era of conflict and Cold War.
[00:00:44.156 --> 00:00:51.402]  We have before us the opportunity to forge, for ourselves and for future generations, a new world order.
[00:00:52.202 --> 00:00:58.107]  A world where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle, governs the conduct of nations.
[00:00:59.387 --> 00:01:05.212]  When we are successful, and we will be, we have a real chance at this new world order.
[00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:14.730]  In order in which a credible United Nations can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise and vision of the UN's founders.
[00:01:15.431 --> 00:01:22.800]  Vladimir Putin told Oliver Stone that in the year 2000 he asked President Clinton if Russia could join NATO.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.302]  Which he said made the American delegation very nervous.
[00:01:26.782 --> 00:01:28.844]  They were not interested in world peace.
[00:01:29.324 --> 00:01:30.625]  They had different plans.
[00:01:31.345 --> 00:01:40.431]  In 1997, the Project for the New American Century was founded by William Crystal and Victoria Newland's husband, Robert Kagan.
[00:01:40.931 --> 00:01:52.419]  In September of 2000, they published their agenda entitled, Rebuilding America's Defenses, which outlined an ambitious and aggressive plan to achieve world dominance.
[00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.540]  Starting in the Middle East and ending with Russia.
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:10.544]  The document acknowledged the fact that their world domination efforts would trouble American allies and could therefore be a long process absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event like a new Pearl Harbor.
[00:02:11.144 --> 00:02:15.665]  A year after publishing this, 2,000 people were murdered in the World Trade Center.
[00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:19.948]  And blamed on a small terrorist group created by the CIA.
[00:02:20.388 --> 00:02:26.572]  And with this catastrophic and catalyzing event, the plan for a new American century went into action.
[00:02:27.092 --> 00:02:35.377]  About ten days after 9-11, I went through the Pentagon and one of the generals called me and he says, we've made the decision we're going to war with Iraq.
[00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.819]  This was on or about the 20th of September.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.361]  I said, we're going to war with Iraq?
[00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:40.741]  Why?
[00:02:42.717 --> 00:02:44.138]  He said, I don't know.
[00:02:44.758 --> 00:02:50.360]  So I came back to see him a few weeks later, and by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan.
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.000]  I said, are we still going to war with Iraq?
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.421]  And he said, oh, it's worse than that.
[00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:57.462]  He said, I just got this down from upstairs, meeting the Secretary of Defense's office today.
[00:02:57.502 --> 00:03:09.907]  And he said, this is a memo that describes how we're going to take out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and finishing off Iran.
[00:03:10.808 --> 00:03:11.789]  George H.W.
[00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:19.275]  Bush's son, George W., began a propaganda campaign to sell the American public on overthrowing Iraq.
[00:03:19.656 --> 00:03:21.778]  I take the threat very seriously.
[00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:30.925]  I take the fact that he develops weapons of mass destruction very seriously.
[00:03:32.467 --> 00:03:36.241]   Either you are with us, Or you were with the terrorists.
[00:03:37.041 --> 00:03:43.124]  When the lies became obvious, George W. made jokes while reveling in the blood of the innocent.
[00:03:43.644 --> 00:03:45.685]  Those weapons of mass destruction gotta be somewhere.
[00:03:50.108 --> 00:03:51.328]  Nope, no weapons over there.
[00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.593]  Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that murdering millions of Iraqi children was worth it.
[00:04:02.154 --> 00:04:04.595]  We have heard that a half a million children have died.
[00:04:05.433 --> 00:04:09.857]  I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima.
[00:04:10.597 --> 00:04:13.860]  And, you know, is the price worth it?
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.244]  I think this is a very hard choice, but we think the price is worth it.
[00:04:19.664 --> 00:04:30.073]  The power-hungry cabal made up of close-knit families who practice multi-generational child abuse and mass mind control began overthrowing sovereign nations.
[00:04:30.453 --> 00:04:34.674]  And murdering innocent civilians became the new norm for U.S.
[00:04:34.734 --> 00:04:35.654]  foreign policy.
[00:04:36.035 --> 00:04:43.637]  But their plan for global domination was failing, and starting in 2020 with the COVID scam, they began targeting U.S.
[00:04:43.697 --> 00:04:44.197]  citizens.
[00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:55.720]  They have become desperate, and they are going for broke, slaughtering innocent Palestinians to spark a war with Iran, and sacrificing the people of Ukraine to hopelessly take on Russia.
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.981]  These inbred families are getting old, and they are fighting for their lives.
[00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:06.143]  There is too much at stake for them to ever give up, which makes them more dangerous than ever.
[00:05:06.523 --> 00:05:10.084]  But they are few, and we are many, and they must be stopped.
[00:05:10.544 --> 00:05:24.784]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:05:25.133 --> 00:05:26.374]  Mainstream media.
[00:05:26.935 --> 00:05:28.056]  Government cover-ups.
[00:05:28.817 --> 00:05:30.058]  You want to stop Ernie?
[00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:31.440]  Well, so does he.
[00:05:31.981 --> 00:05:36.746]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.872]  Hello Americans, I'm Paul Harvey.
[00:05:42.213 --> 00:05:43.795]  If I were the devil.
[00:05:44.671 --> 00:05:48.298]  If I were the Prince of Darkness, I'd want to engulf the whole world in darkness.
[00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:55.432]  And I'd have a third of its real estate and four-fifths of its population, but I wouldn't be happy until I had seized the ripest apple on the tree.
[00:05:55.452 --> 00:05:56.774]  Thee.
[00:05:58.323 --> 00:06:01.404]  So I set about however necessary to take over the United States.
[00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:05.325]  President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[00:06:05.345 --> 00:06:06.645]  I'd subvert the churches first.
[00:06:06.725 --> 00:06:08.425]  I'd begin with a campaign of whispers.
[00:06:08.845 --> 00:06:12.246]  With the wisdom of a serpent I would whisper to you as I whispered to Eve.
[00:06:12.526 --> 00:06:13.526]  Do as you please.
[00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:15.827]  To the young I would whisper that the Bible is a myth.
[00:06:16.247 --> 00:06:19.748]  I would convince them that man created God instead of the other way around.
[00:06:20.128 --> 00:06:23.729]  I would confide that what's bad is good and what's good is square.
[00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:31.696]   And the old I would teach And then I'd get organized.
[00:06:31.796 --> 00:06:37.801]  I'd educate authors in how to make lurid literature exciting so that anything else would appear dull and uninteresting.
[00:06:37.862 --> 00:06:40.985]  I'd threaten TV with dirtier movies and vice versa.
[00:06:41.265 --> 00:06:42.967]  I'd peddle narcotics to whom I could.
[00:06:43.027 --> 00:06:46.050]  I'd sell alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of distinction.
[00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.192]  I'd tranquilize the rest with pills.
[00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:59.857]  If I were the devil, I'd soon have families at war with themselves, churches at war with themselves, and nations at war with themselves, until each in its turn was consumed.
[00:07:00.357 --> 00:07:05.721]  And with promises of higher ratings, I'd have mesmerizing media fanning the flame.
[00:07:06.161 --> 00:07:09.022]  The President of the United States is racist.
[00:07:09.102 --> 00:07:15.943]  If I were the devil, I would encourage schools to refine young intellects, but neglect the disciplined emotions, just let those run wild.
[00:07:16.043 --> 00:07:21.285]  Within a decade, I'd have prisons overflowing, I'd have judges promoting pornography.
[00:07:21.365 --> 00:07:27.046]  Soon I could evict God from the courthouse, then from the schoolhouse, and then from the houses of Congress.
[00:07:27.126 --> 00:07:30.207]  And in his own churches, I would substitute psychology for religion.
[00:07:32.225 --> 00:07:37.054]  I would lure priests and pastors into misusing boys and girls and church money.
[00:07:37.494 --> 00:07:44.787]  If I were the devil, I'd take from those who have and give to those who wanted until I had killed the incentive of the ambitious.
[00:07:46.481 --> 00:07:48.162]  I would caution against extremes.
[00:07:48.303 --> 00:07:49.183]  I'm here to warn people!
[00:07:49.263 --> 00:07:50.604]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[00:07:50.864 --> 00:07:51.745]  This isn't a game!
[00:07:51.965 --> 00:08:02.832]  In hard work, in patriotism, in moral conduct, I would convince the young that marriage is old-fashioned, that swinging is more fun, that what you see on TV is the way to be.
[00:08:03.513 --> 00:08:11.939]  And thus I could undress you in public, and I could lure you into bed with diseases for which there is no cure.
[00:08:11.799 --> 00:08:15.799]   In other words, if I were the devil, I'd just keep right on doing what he's doing.
[00:08:15.799 --> 00:08:33.798]  [Music]
[00:08:34.798 --> 00:08:48.798]  [Music]
[00:08:48.798 --> 00:08:54.798]   I'm watching the midterms, then you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[00:08:54.908 --> 00:08:58.590]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[00:09:02.572 --> 00:09:04.393]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[00:09:04.413 --> 00:09:04.753]  You want a drop?
[00:09:04.773 --> 00:09:05.073]  You want a drop?
[00:09:05.093 --> 00:09:05.173]  Yeah!
[00:09:05.193 --> 00:09:22.564]   Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch boys, Muslims.
[00:09:22.564 --> 00:09:32.564]  [APPLAUSE]
[00:09:32.564 --> 00:09:41.184]  [MUSIC]
[00:09:41.184 --> 00:09:44.283]   And you would think everybody in the country is just like,
[00:09:44.283 --> 00:09:45.164]  to the bunker.
[00:09:45.164 --> 00:09:55.783]  [MUSIC]
[00:09:55.783 --> 00:09:59.524]  It's Wednesday, February 7th, 2024.
[00:09:59.594 --> 00:10:00.675]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:10:01.736 --> 00:10:06.939]  We are 271 days, 12 hours, 49 minutes, 18 seconds off the most important election in world history.
[00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.362]  The globalists are hurtling us towards full World War III.
[00:10:11.182 --> 00:10:15.545]  They're now calling for Dr. Carlson to be sanctioned by the European Union.
[00:10:16.146 --> 00:10:18.007]  The neocons are calling for his arrest.
[00:10:18.087 --> 00:10:22.330]  It's all about the war on the press and the war on the people intensifying.
[00:10:23.211 --> 00:10:26.093]  The Republican traitors joined Democrats.
[00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:31.871]  To kill the impeachment of the child trafficking kingpin, Mayorkas.
[00:10:32.791 --> 00:10:34.872]  There is so much we're going to be covering today.
[00:10:35.132 --> 00:10:39.953]  And Lauren Witzke, a great reporter and journalist and talk show host, is going to be with us in the studio today.
[00:10:40.593 --> 00:10:48.675]  She came here to town to be on the show, but I had an emergency yesterday, so I had to leave at the start of the fourth hour that I was going to host live and didn't deal with it.
[00:10:49.295 --> 00:10:52.796]  And this is just a little side note, but it gives you the climate of the left here.
[00:10:53.851 --> 00:10:59.636]  We have leftists, and I'm not going to get into the details of it, filing constant fake police reports on me.
[00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:03.179]  And there's been all sorts of stuff that's going on.
[00:11:03.759 --> 00:11:20.657]   They've done things in a whole bunch of Texas counties, including Travis, where they hack into the database computers of Courthouses and issue arrest warrants for me from other states to Texas.
[00:11:20.677 --> 00:11:25.219]  So the next level of swatting for child rape and stuff like that.
[00:11:26.999 --> 00:11:28.260]  That's the kind of stuff that goes on.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:43.566]  I'm not going to get into all of it, but I was going to be hosting the fourth hour today, but I'm not going to do it now because I have the police coming here so that I can brief them so they can go arrest these people because they are absolutely sick of it.
[00:11:45.578 --> 00:11:48.500]  And it's not just one group, but it's a bunch of them.
[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.762]  And so, I don't tell you about this stuff.
[00:11:51.802 --> 00:11:52.782]  I don't complain about it.
[00:11:53.203 --> 00:11:55.144]  It is non-stop.
[00:11:57.005 --> 00:11:59.466]  And I know the same kind of crap happens to Tucker.
[00:11:59.967 --> 00:12:01.388]  Can you imagine being Trump?
[00:12:01.468 --> 00:12:02.808]  I mean, it's 50 times that.
[00:12:02.989 --> 00:12:03.649]  A hundred times.
[00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.791]  And the left brags, ha ha ha.
[00:12:07.291 --> 00:12:09.833]  You know, Trump's running out of war chest money.
[00:12:09.853 --> 00:12:13.355]  Yeah, he's real popular, but he's not raising any money, ha ha ha.
[00:12:14.824 --> 00:12:19.127]  We've got the people starting to wake up, but we do not have the Black Rocks and the New World Order behind us.
[00:12:19.147 --> 00:12:23.169]  So we've got you behind us, we're in this together, but this, I need your prayer.
[00:12:23.189 --> 00:12:33.616]  InfoWars needs your prayer, because this country and the whole world needs your prayers, because the globalists are moving on everybody this year.
[00:12:33.636 --> 00:12:35.637]  2024 is the big one.
[00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:43.122]  I mean, I was literally, couldn't get on the air at the start of the show, because I'm talking to the police that are calling me.
[00:12:44.437 --> 00:12:45.597]  All right, and I'm not complaining.
[00:12:45.917 --> 00:12:47.478]  That's why I was going to come right off the start.
[00:12:47.518 --> 00:12:52.760]  I heard a few new reports that were powerful and that famous Paul Harvey, if I was the devil, updated.
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:13:00.142]  But that's how they plan to just weigh us down with regulations and taxes and high energy costs and crime.
[00:13:00.162 --> 00:13:01.362]  I'm talking about all of us.
[00:13:02.723 --> 00:13:04.183]  They are at war with us.
[00:13:04.203 --> 00:13:05.183]  Do you understand that?
[00:13:05.803 --> 00:13:08.264]  We don't say the globalists are the enemy, just to use that word.
[00:13:08.304 --> 00:13:11.025]  We don't say the Democrats are literally an enemy force.
[00:13:13.166 --> 00:13:13.746]  It's true.
[00:13:14.983 --> 00:13:20.444]  And the bigger you are in the fight against them, the more you get to get up close to them and really see what they are.
[00:13:20.464 --> 00:13:26.566]  And I'm telling you, they're walking, talking devils on the face of the earth.
[00:13:28.366 --> 00:13:32.367]  And it's a spiritual energy that energizes them.
[00:13:32.467 --> 00:13:35.568]  And they are, they're satanic.
[00:13:36.228 --> 00:13:37.749]  They're absolutely satanic.
[00:13:39.893 --> 00:13:41.934]  I've been trying for two weeks and I'm behind.
[00:13:41.954 --> 00:13:49.436]  I'm going to start doing multiple ones a week just for the Crowder Show because I have this whole Satanism special that I've been working on for like a month.
[00:13:49.997 --> 00:13:51.277]  Didn't get it shot last week.
[00:13:51.317 --> 00:13:52.477]  Tried to shoot it yesterday.
[00:13:53.138 --> 00:13:59.200]  Couldn't do that because six fake police reports filed yesterday.
[00:14:01.681 --> 00:14:19.637]   But now one of the people doing it, their identity is known, so they're going to be getting Visit reportedly so but but this is this is all next level swatting ladies and gentlemen Next level harassment, and I'm a big boy.
[00:14:19.677 --> 00:14:23.860]  I can take it but That's how they take your time.
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:33.926]  It's how they take your energy It's why you gotta stay focused on God and focused on justice and just know that God's gonna carry us through this But can you imagine if we just roll over the new world order how bad it's gonna be?
[00:14:35.247 --> 00:14:36.828]  Can can you imagine?
[00:14:38.569 --> 00:15:05.807]   How Insane it would be because I don't let the enemy take my time Any more than I have to so I haven't really told the crew about this stuff I haven't even you know, I don't even get into it I just heard say there's a lot of stuff going on as I've got arrows and stuff Shooting past and God has put a defense shield up around us, but it's still not fun so I'm gonna I'm gonna do the show here and
[00:15:07.952 --> 00:15:10.814]  And I'm also massively prepared for the broadcast despite all this going on.
[00:15:10.834 --> 00:15:11.594]  I was up at 4 a.m.
[00:15:11.634 --> 00:15:12.074]  this morning.
[00:15:12.975 --> 00:15:19.178]  And then it's a bunch of news I didn't get to yesterday that we're going to be covering and going over here today.
[00:15:19.298 --> 00:15:20.599]  So let me just do this.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:27.863]  Let me tell you about what we're going to be hitting.
[00:15:27.903 --> 00:15:32.126]  We have the incredible border information, so many angles, so many fronts.
[00:15:32.586 --> 00:15:34.847]  Each one of these stories we can talk two hours about.
[00:15:34.867 --> 00:15:35.928]  I mean, it's just insane.
[00:15:37.116 --> 00:15:42.640]  House falls short of trying to impeach Mayorkas after four Republicans joined Democrats.
[00:15:44.341 --> 00:15:44.942]  Gaslighting!
[00:15:44.962 --> 00:15:48.124]  Biden claims only reason border not secures Donald Trump.
[00:15:48.604 --> 00:15:53.528]  We've got all the actual federal graphs and numbers we're going to be showing you.
[00:15:53.548 --> 00:15:54.169]  That's not true.
[00:15:54.189 --> 00:15:58.392]  The GOP had a good press conference, which is what we need to hear more of.
[00:15:58.412 --> 00:16:00.413]  They just said, we have a criminal government.
[00:16:00.433 --> 00:16:02.675]  There are a bunch of criminal liars and they're all frauds.
[00:16:02.695 --> 00:16:05.337]  They all need to go to jail and they're full of BS.
[00:16:06.414 --> 00:16:09.036]  And Mitch McConnell needs to step down.
[00:16:09.957 --> 00:16:11.198]  And that's what we need to see more of.
[00:16:11.218 --> 00:16:12.579]  So we're going to get to those video clips.
[00:16:13.519 --> 00:16:17.382]  World's wealthiest man using his own social media platform to expose Biden's border invasion.
[00:16:18.183 --> 00:16:18.944]  That's Elon Musk.
[00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:25.609]  We got flashbacks of Newsom and Biden and others saying, oh, Trump wants to control the border.
[00:16:25.629 --> 00:16:26.269]  How dare him?
[00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:27.910]  A few years ago.
[00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:30.152]  And now here they are saying, oh, no, no, he broke the border.
[00:16:30.993 --> 00:16:32.814]  So we've got a lot on that front.
[00:16:33.214 --> 00:16:33.995]  That's only part of it.
[00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:42.498]  We have an incredibly important report that I just aired the first five but we should probably air again it's so powerful.
[00:16:43.018 --> 00:16:46.559]  The desperate failing plan of the new world order.
[00:16:47.279 --> 00:16:53.141]  The desperate failing plan for a new American century by the neocons that are quarterbacking so much of this.
[00:16:54.021 --> 00:17:10.451]   Obviously we have the big Tucker Carlson Report and that they're dropping the interview tomorrow at seven o'clock central eight o'clock eastern Very smart to not sit on it and to get it out very very quickly.
[00:17:10.471 --> 00:17:32.018]   It's very very historic we have The EU saying they want sanctions on him some are calling for Tucker's arrest This just shows you what criminals they are They don't want you to be able to hear what you want to be able to listen to as an adult When people censor You're not just censoring the person that's being censored.
[00:17:32.658 --> 00:17:39.159]  You're censoring everybody's ability to make up their own mind.
[00:17:40.079 --> 00:17:42.400]  And I know everybody knows that, but do you really let that sink in?
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.060]  We tend to think of censorship as the individual.
[00:17:45.861 --> 00:17:46.841]  And believe me, it's not fun.
[00:17:46.881 --> 00:17:48.141]  I'm one of the most censored people in the world.
[00:17:49.121 --> 00:17:56.543]  Because then they can lie about you and do whatever they want, but they're censoring me because they don't want you to hear what I'm saying and what our guests are saying.
[00:17:58.263 --> 00:18:05.946]  So I'm telling you, I have zero, zero pride in knowing a bunch of famous Hollywood people.
[00:18:05.966 --> 00:18:07.166]  In fact, I'm ashamed of it, pretty much.
[00:18:08.506 --> 00:18:15.969]  And I have no, nothing thrills me other than a sunset and, you know, hiking and fishing with my family.
[00:18:15.989 --> 00:18:19.530]  I mean, a lot of stuff thrills me, but nothing in the establishment thrills me.
[00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:22.231]  No status, no power, nothing.
[00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:23.671]  But freedom matters to me.
[00:18:24.592 --> 00:18:34.128]   But I got to tell you, Tucker Carlson is a thoroughbred now, and he's totally awake, and he's a good friend, and I am just very, very blessed to know him.
[00:18:34.688 --> 00:18:35.748]  We're very, very blessed to have him.
[00:18:35.888 --> 00:18:41.291]  And I just take extreme satisfaction in his success, but also have a lot of anxiety for the danger he's in.
[00:18:42.171 --> 00:18:48.453]  And I just wish so many other people in the independent media, which is now the dominant media, would get this.
[00:18:48.533 --> 00:18:49.614]  And more and more are getting it.
[00:18:49.634 --> 00:18:50.274]  I want to explain something.
[00:18:50.954 --> 00:18:52.375]  We're not in competition.
[00:18:53.396 --> 00:18:53.976]  With each other.
[00:18:54.297 --> 00:18:55.697]  Different talk shows, different people.
[00:18:56.418 --> 00:18:58.219]  I'm here to promote everybody that promotes liberty.
[00:18:58.939 --> 00:19:04.262]  But so many others are good people but they're still territorial because it's about competition with each other.
[00:19:04.743 --> 00:19:06.343]  We're far beyond that.
[00:19:06.384 --> 00:19:07.684]  We're in a total war.
[00:19:08.985 --> 00:19:10.666]  My success is your success.
[00:19:11.046 --> 00:19:13.848]  Tucker Carlson's success is my success and your success.
[00:19:14.268 --> 00:19:15.629]  Our success is his success.
[00:19:16.209 --> 00:19:18.631]  And the more Joe Rogan wakes up, that's our victory too.
[00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:20.792]  And Russell Brand and everybody else.
[00:19:21.926 --> 00:19:27.731]  So, my wealth is my children and the future.
[00:19:28.451 --> 00:19:31.894]  And people like Tucker Carlson have the best chance of saving me and my children.
[00:19:32.134 --> 00:19:33.675]  So Tucker Carlson is mine.
[00:19:34.276 --> 00:19:35.317]  He belongs to me.
[00:19:35.337 --> 00:19:37.639]  And he belongs to you.
[00:19:37.939 --> 00:19:38.719]  And I belong to you.
[00:19:38.739 --> 00:19:39.680]  Do you understand that?
[00:19:41.362 --> 00:19:43.703]  These people hate us because they know we're good.
[00:19:44.224 --> 00:19:44.944]  We're decent.
[00:19:45.825 --> 00:19:49.168]  We're not perfect, but dammit, we're not out to hurt people and we believe in humanity.
[00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:54.171]  I played this clip 15 times probably, but I want to play it again.
[00:19:54.211 --> 00:20:07.856]  Pull up There Will Be Blood, the clip where the oil man explains to his cousin, who he learns isn't his cousin, kills him later, that he has a competition in him and he doesn't like to see other people do well, including their families.
[00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:25.038]  And as soon as you understand that that's really how the Rothschilds and Rockefellers are, and really how the Obamas are, and really how the John Kerry's are, and really how the Tony Blair's are, and how the Pope is, total New World Order, these people hate you!
[00:20:26.238 --> 00:20:27.919]  They hate your stinking guts!
[00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:30.640]  They feel good!
[00:20:33.373 --> 00:20:38.276]  When they see you starving and under their boot, it makes them feel powerful.
[00:20:38.576 --> 00:20:42.739]  And I know you're not like that, and so that's why you don't understand it, and it doesn't make sense.
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.621]  You see a great-looking family...
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:50.264]  Great looking husband, kids, wife come in, happy, well behaved.
[00:20:50.384 --> 00:20:52.045]  They can be black, they can be brown, they can be white.
[00:20:52.626 --> 00:20:55.489]  You feel good seeing people successful.
[00:20:55.549 --> 00:21:01.935]  You see a great composer, or a great singer, or a great artist, or a great football player, and it makes you feel good about humanity.
[00:21:02.636 --> 00:21:07.741]  You need to get it into your head, and it needs to burn in real good!
[00:21:08.602 --> 00:21:11.644]  That our enemy is a 180 degrees opposite of that.
[00:21:12.064 --> 00:21:16.507]  They cannot stand anybody having success but them.
[00:21:17.768 --> 00:21:18.949]  And that's why they're communist.
[00:21:19.169 --> 00:21:20.710]  They don't care about the average person.
[00:21:21.011 --> 00:21:22.391]  They don't care about the environment.
[00:21:23.612 --> 00:21:34.740]  So they pose as the environmentalists, and they pose as the communitarians, and, oh, they're gonna love you, and what they are is ravenous rats who even hate each other.
[00:21:36.613 --> 00:21:38.794]  They're disgusting in their hierarchy.
[00:21:39.815 --> 00:21:40.856]  And they will be defeated.
[00:21:41.896 --> 00:21:44.278]  At the end of the day, they're Satanists.
[00:21:44.678 --> 00:21:47.660]  Yeah, play the clip again, folks, because this illustrates it all.
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.622]  But just imagine this attitude turned up on 10.
[00:21:50.682 --> 00:21:51.583]  Go ahead and play it.
[00:21:54.164 --> 00:21:55.485]  I have a competition in me.
[00:21:57.647 --> 00:21:59.268]  I want no one else to succeed.
[00:21:59.288 --> 00:22:06.012]  I hate most people.
[00:22:07.495 --> 00:22:08.756]  That part of me is gone.
[00:22:10.918 --> 00:22:12.520]  Working and not succeeding.
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:17.744]  All my failures have left me.
[00:22:20.947 --> 00:22:22.128]  I just don't care.
[00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:25.752]  Well, if it's in me, it's in you.
[00:22:28.394 --> 00:22:30.394]  There are times when I...
[00:22:30.394 --> 00:22:34.394]  I look at people and I see nothing worth liking.
[00:22:34.394 --> 00:22:41.394]  I want to earn enough money I can...
[00:22:41.394 --> 00:22:44.394]  get away from everyone.
[00:22:44.394 --> 00:22:47.752]  [BIRDS CHIRPING]
[00:22:47.752 --> 00:22:57.752]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:22:48.757 --> 00:22:50.757]  What will you do about your boy?
[00:22:50.757 --> 00:23:01.115]  I don't know.
[00:23:01.115 --> 00:23:02.477]  (growling)
[00:23:02.429 --> 00:23:03.410]  Maybe it'll change.
[00:23:05.071 --> 00:23:05.652]  It's your sound.
[00:23:05.692 --> 00:23:06.392]  Come back to you.
[00:23:06.472 --> 00:23:06.913]  I don't know.
[00:23:07.739 --> 00:23:08.839]  Maybe no one knows that.
[00:23:09.319 --> 00:23:10.980]  The doctor might not know that.
[00:23:11.579 --> 00:23:13.579]  Where's his mother?
[00:23:13.579 --> 00:23:21.579]  I don't want to talk about those things.
[00:23:21.579 --> 00:23:26.019]  [BIRDS CHIRPING]
[00:23:26.123 --> 00:23:27.803]  I see the worst in people, Henry.
[00:23:30.223 --> 00:23:33.364]  I don't need to look past seeing them to get all I need.
[00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:39.611]  I've built up my hatreds over the years, little by little.
[00:23:44.053 --> 00:23:45.814]  Having you here gives me a second breath.
[00:23:48.735 --> 00:23:50.716]  I can't keep doing this on my own.
[00:23:54.278 --> 00:23:56.278]  With these...
[00:23:56.278 --> 00:24:00.278]  People.
[00:24:00.278 --> 00:24:06.278]  They want us dead.
[00:24:06.215 --> 00:24:07.920]  That's not hyperbole, that's not hype.
[00:24:08.362 --> 00:24:08.984]  That's real.
[00:24:10.029 --> 00:24:11.970]  They want you dead!
[00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.970]  Dead!
[00:24:14.931 --> 00:24:22.313]  I have a stack of mainstream news and new major scientific studies that it's over 20 million dead from the shots.
[00:24:22.854 --> 00:24:25.655]  And cancer is the highest ever recorded shooting straight up!
[00:24:26.455 --> 00:24:30.797]  And they're saying all the young people are all having heart attacks and they're all getting cancer now and we don't know what's happening!
[00:24:30.817 --> 00:24:37.179]  And they got billboards and TV shows and public service announcements about it because they're murdering us!
[00:24:39.946 --> 00:24:44.508]  And people tune in, you'll blend back years ago, he goes, I tune into that Alex Jones and he's scary.
[00:24:46.429 --> 00:24:50.151]  Buddy, I ain't scary, I'm just the light pointing at what's scary.
[00:24:50.972 --> 00:24:51.992]  I know this is real.
[00:24:52.212 --> 00:24:53.213]  Now it's out in the open.
[00:24:53.793 --> 00:24:55.814]  And that's the best part about this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:56.174 --> 00:24:59.336]  Nobody's gonna be able to deny things anymore.
[00:25:00.136 --> 00:25:02.697]  Hell, how can you deny what's going on right now?
[00:25:02.717 --> 00:25:05.599]  All right, I got all this news to hit.
[00:25:07.771 --> 00:25:12.434]  I am beyond pissed off and almost didn't do the show today.
[00:25:12.454 --> 00:25:17.058]  I just, I don't want to start screaming, blowing up on air.
[00:25:17.958 --> 00:25:19.039]  It's not good for anybody.
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:26.404]  But I tell you what, man, I just felt like I could just unscrew these people's heads.
[00:25:26.444 --> 00:25:27.245]  I know I could too.
[00:25:28.766 --> 00:25:31.347]  And I built up my hatred for these people over the years.
[00:25:32.028 --> 00:25:32.608]  But you know what?
[00:25:32.708 --> 00:25:33.269]  That'll kill you.
[00:25:34.997 --> 00:25:38.682]  It certainly had an effect on me physically, so I've turned loose the hate.
[00:25:39.625 --> 00:25:41.726]  I do this because I love my family and I care about you.
[00:25:42.246 --> 00:25:45.828]  Because if you aren't doing well, my family's not going to be doing well.
[00:25:46.068 --> 00:25:50.791]  These people don't understand that when they crap all over everything, that affects them.
[00:25:50.811 --> 00:25:58.075]  And that's why they're so unhappy is because they're projecting nothing but destruction on the rest of us.
[00:25:58.494 --> 00:26:04.894]   And we just have to admit what we're up against and admit that lying down and denying what's going on and sticking
[00:26:04.894 --> 00:26:08.494]  our heads in the sand is going to get us all killed.
[00:26:08.494 --> 00:26:12.494]  [Sigh]
[00:26:12.494 --> 00:26:16.494]  Oh boy.
[00:26:16.494 --> 00:26:18.494]  (sighs)
[00:26:17.568 --> 00:26:19.568]  You know, let's do something fun.

[00:26:27.655 --> 00:26:33.758]  Let's set aside them trying to arrest Tucker Carlson for free speech.
[00:26:34.559 --> 00:26:36.280]  What that means for everybody.
[00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:40.142]  Let's just set aside Mayorkas and all the child trafficking and all the evil.
[00:26:41.743 --> 00:26:49.989]   And you got Steven Crowder breaking with his investigative unit, another big public school that knew of a leptis plan to kill everybody, so they suppressed it.
[00:26:52.129 --> 00:26:53.790]  They just broke that news, it's hitting the news.

[00:27:05.792 --> 00:27:06.733]  What's causing it?
[00:27:06.773 --> 00:27:07.693]  No one knew.
[00:27:08.194 --> 00:27:09.515]  mRNA vaccine.
[00:27:09.535 --> 00:27:11.916]  19 vaccines cause more death than they helped.
[00:27:11.936 --> 00:27:12.897]  Of course they didn't help anybody.
[00:27:13.417 --> 00:27:14.538]  That's another lie right there.
[00:27:15.618 --> 00:27:18.200]  Inside Donald Trump's incredible cash crunch.
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:22.743]  2024 is the new 1984.
[00:27:23.003 --> 00:27:23.603]  Oh boy is it.
[00:27:23.924 --> 00:27:24.624]  Big article there.
[00:27:24.644 --> 00:27:26.325]  Oh yeah.
[00:27:26.184 --> 00:27:30.664]   JPMorgan Chase plans massive branch network expansion while small banks implode.
[00:27:30.664 --> 00:27:38.585]  There's another big report out in public schools.
[00:27:38.794 --> 00:27:41.756]  Children are being given a secret social emotional learning score.
[00:27:44.998 --> 00:27:53.404]  But the big news is the Putin interview and everything that ties into Biden.
[00:27:53.444 --> 00:27:54.765]  I got another clip of Biden right here.
[00:27:56.013 --> 00:27:58.474]  I didn't see on the list, but I saw it on my stack I sent you, Biden.
[00:27:59.014 --> 00:28:00.595]  Says, we gotta send Ukraine a bunch of money.
[00:28:00.635 --> 00:28:05.337]  I'm wearing my Ukraine pin and my Ukraine tie, because they're in a lot of trouble.
[00:28:05.557 --> 00:28:06.638]  I thought they were invincible.
[00:28:07.678 --> 00:28:09.059]  But I got some funny stuff, too.
[00:28:09.139 --> 00:28:09.779]  We come right back.
[00:28:09.799 --> 00:28:10.199]  Stay with us.
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:12.180]  Two words.

[00:28:39.545 --> 00:28:40.185]  It's incredible.

[00:29:13.904 --> 00:29:17.065]  The huge developments with the border on so many fronts.
[00:29:17.125 --> 00:29:18.706]  Biden lying at record levels.
[00:29:18.726 --> 00:29:19.346]  We have the proof.
[00:29:20.174 --> 00:29:24.576]  Then of course, Mayorkas not getting impeached because traitorous Republicans voted with the Democrats.
[00:29:25.497 --> 00:29:26.397]  And so much more.
[00:29:26.417 --> 00:29:29.659]  A special guest in studio to cover the waterfront, Derren Hernandez popping in later.
[00:29:30.019 --> 00:29:34.321]  He's got incredible footage all by himself on the Mexico-California border.
[00:29:35.328 --> 00:29:38.768]   He decided to pivot there and boy some dangerous situations he's been in.
[00:29:38.768 --> 00:29:44.607]   In the night time, in there with the smugglers, in there at the UN camps. I mean it's just crazy
[00:29:44.607 --> 00:29:50.209]   stuff. In fact I've told him, I said maybe you shouldn't go those places alone at night. I mean
[00:29:50.209 --> 00:29:59.088]   that's just wild. So he's got the illegal alien smugglers in English like this is our country F you
[00:29:59.088 --> 00:30:00.847]  screw America we're taking you down.
[00:30:00.979 --> 00:30:02.399]  I mean, it is just wild stuff.
[00:30:02.419 --> 00:30:06.540]  And that's all posted up on RealAlexJones and Infowars.com as well.
[00:30:08.141 --> 00:30:11.721]  But I saw this a couple days ago, and there was so much news, I didn't get to it.
[00:30:11.741 --> 00:30:20.258]   But you know, it really is important, because when I posted this on, or I linked to it on my ex account, It already had like 15 million views.
[00:30:20.338 --> 00:30:21.739]  It got a couple more million views.
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:31.027]  And I noticed the left was in there defending it, saying, you're bigoted, Mr. Jones, against women because you're making fun of this.
[00:30:31.868 --> 00:30:34.690]  Well, it'd be like saying a man can have a baby.
[00:30:37.773 --> 00:30:39.294]  It's just, it's ridiculous.
[00:30:40.775 --> 00:31:00.627]   So, footage from Dubai shows women from Chile's Highest tier police task force attempting to complete in the 2024 UAE SWAT challenge where they're embarrassingly struggled to complete the first obstacle alone and couldn't do it.
[00:31:02.748 --> 00:31:13.091]  Now, there are similar obstacle courses that, you know, you can go pay to go on and I'm not in great shape myself, but I could complete these courses way better than these young women.
[00:31:14.235 --> 00:31:15.836]  I can certainly complete most of the course.
[00:31:16.917 --> 00:31:21.461]  I'd probably have some broken ribs or something by the end of it, but that's because I'm out of shape.
[00:31:22.882 --> 00:31:25.163]  I mean, I can still hike 15 miles, 20 miles if I need to.
[00:31:25.203 --> 00:31:31.048]  I can still hike up a mountain, but I'm not, you know, certainly good at the type of stuff SWAT teams do.
[00:31:31.668 --> 00:31:39.594]  But watching the women compared to the men was like watching a BB gun versus a .50 caliber rifle.
[00:31:43.345 --> 00:31:57.449]  Hollywood puts out all these movies and this culture where always the toughest person's a woman, she can beat up 20 men, and the women are all in charge, and all that is to do, all that's designed to do is break down civilization and society.
[00:31:57.469 --> 00:31:58.969]  It's not to empower women.
[00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:01.270]  It is to break up the family.
[00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:03.631]  It is to confuse roles.
[00:32:03.751 --> 00:32:07.252]  It is to make women think they can have these type of careers.
[00:32:08.112 --> 00:32:10.954]  So that they don't go out and have a family and so they'll be part of the system.
[00:32:11.415 --> 00:32:19.822]  And then it sabotages the human system and they can bring in AI and robots to replace the post-industrial collapsed human society.
[00:32:19.862 --> 00:32:20.723]  That's their official plan.
[00:32:20.763 --> 00:32:23.505]  So I'm going to roll you some of the footage here.
[00:32:25.967 --> 00:32:34.134]  And it shows the women proudly charging out and then getting the first obstacle, which one woman made it through.
[00:32:35.444 --> 00:32:39.867]  And it's like a Laurel and Hardy or Three Stooges episode.
[00:32:39.907 --> 00:32:41.789]  I mean, hell, just see it for yourself.
[00:32:42.269 --> 00:32:44.290]  For radio listeners, I'll give you a play-by-play.
[00:32:47.593 --> 00:32:54.878]  Here come the women charging up.
[00:32:54.898 --> 00:32:57.760]  Five ladies teams involved.
[00:33:01.437 --> 00:33:03.218]  In the UE SWAT Challenge this year.
[00:33:03.639 --> 00:33:05.660]  And they grab the little trolley.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:06.340]  Belarus.
[00:33:06.641 --> 00:33:07.241]  Zip lines.
[00:33:07.341 --> 00:33:07.941]  Thailand.
[00:33:08.322 --> 00:33:08.642]  Chile.
[00:33:09.823 --> 00:33:11.624]  Two teams from the Emirates.
[00:33:12.485 --> 00:33:15.847]  One of them makes it across.
[00:33:17.568 --> 00:33:18.669]  And the others fall in the water.
[00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:23.292]  The first one to get wet in the ice bath today.
[00:33:23.312 --> 00:33:24.913]  And this goes on and on.
[00:33:28.413 --> 00:33:31.416]  Well, they are stuck in the middle of that zipline.
[00:33:31.436 --> 00:33:37.442]  So the leader goes back to try to save them and then she falls in.
[00:33:37.462 --> 00:33:47.853]  You have to go back to the beginning of the zipline and do it again and currently Chile have three team members stranded.
[00:33:47.873 --> 00:33:50.676]  They don't even know how to rock their body and move forward with their hands.
[00:33:54.235 --> 00:33:56.617]  Thankfully, the water will be a little bit warmer than it was.
[00:33:57.037 --> 00:33:59.900]  I mean, I... I did this a few years ago with my kids.
[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:01.901]  My fat ass could do this.
[00:34:05.644 --> 00:34:10.989]  I was sore the next day, but... Just goes to show you how, uh, how important momentum is.
[00:34:11.009 --> 00:34:11.629]  Oh, oh!
[00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:15.832]  Three team members in the drink.
[00:34:15.673 --> 00:34:21.913]  Oh, three team members in the drink.
[00:34:21.913 --> 00:34:25.592]  So, oh, and then all of them in the drink.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:29.902]  She's got some nice childbearing hips though.
[00:34:29.722 --> 00:34:35.002]  and um, well, she's got some nice childbearing hips though.
[00:34:35.002 --> 00:34:46.002]   The violations, the major safety violations for dropping weapons in the water are uh,
[00:34:46.002 --> 00:34:48.002]  (laughter)
[00:34:48.002 --> 00:34:57.362]  And they try again.
[00:34:57.362 --> 00:35:01.601]  We need to play Benny Hill music in the background of this.
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:07.362]  Yeah, they don't even... I guess can't swim?
[00:35:07.222 --> 00:35:09.222]  They don't know how to go down five feet and get their guns.
[00:35:09.222 --> 00:35:17.722]   I said on a couple of occasions today that if that first member does not get across the
[00:35:17.722 --> 00:35:23.901]   ice bath and carry that momentum, it forces those behind to stall and that's when the
[00:35:23.901 --> 00:35:25.342]  problems begin.
[00:35:25.342 --> 00:35:26.622]  And we saw that, didn't we?
[00:35:27.018 --> 00:35:29.039]  It almost happened a little bit earlier on.
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:37.763]  We see this all the time in video, like, of a female cop trying to overpower a big man.
[00:35:37.883 --> 00:35:38.523]  It's a joke.
[00:35:39.784 --> 00:35:46.707]  I mean, until just 20 years ago, if you weren't really strong and a big man, and weren't tough, they wouldn't even take you as a man.
[00:35:47.468 --> 00:35:58.501]   Oh, and of course, the added problem They can't even get to the bottom and get their guns properly.
[00:35:58.321 --> 00:36:02.641]   the zip line they become wet hands become wet everything becomes slippy
[00:36:02.641 --> 00:36:11.201]   they can't even get to the bottom and get their guns properly it's 1.2 meters deep that pool and
[00:36:11.201 --> 00:36:17.441]   as you can see it's not even five feet takes a little bit of effort to get out once you've gone
[00:36:17.441 --> 00:36:24.561]   in oh you don't have the body strength to push yourself out of a pool and one uh quick thinking
[00:36:24.561 --> 00:36:32.080]   member of the brt team of chile realizing that it could take a while to retrieve all of those
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:37.201]   pieces of kit is just uh going down under the water to well look out bad guys
[00:36:37.411 --> 00:36:37.971]  She's coming.
[00:36:38.611 --> 00:36:54.649]   Oh the disappointment Nope, she can't get out of the pool remember it's not like you and I Getting in the water there in our swimmers these guys and girls here are carrying a lot of kits and
[00:36:54.649 --> 00:37:04.798]   equipment and it weighs you down as soon as you go in that water and it's even worse if you get wet
[00:37:04.798 --> 00:37:12.868]   this is the third attempt on the first obstacle a zipline well they're not giving up well good for
[00:37:12.868 --> 00:37:20.568]   them they're not giving up Vamos!
[00:37:20.568 --> 00:37:23.408]  They now say they're lowering the standards to be a pilot.
[00:37:23.488 --> 00:37:26.890]  And you can be mentally ill and fly a passenger plane.
[00:37:30.813 --> 00:37:34.295]  How about the women just identify that they won the games?
[00:37:34.675 --> 00:37:37.437]  Just say, we identify as the first place winners.
[00:37:37.877 --> 00:37:40.979]  Of course, if you watch the film of the men, we should probably pull that up, I saw some of it.
[00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.001]  They're just charging through it like it's nothing.
[00:37:44.001 --> 00:37:46.103]  But, you want to see them fail some more?
[00:37:46.143 --> 00:37:47.224]  You want this to just keep going on?
[00:37:47.244 --> 00:37:49.205]  Until they finally just give up?
[00:37:51.877 --> 00:37:54.778]  So that's the false reality they want us to sit here and believe in.
[00:37:55.578 --> 00:37:58.518]  It's not that women are inferior than the other side of the species.
[00:37:58.959 --> 00:38:00.519]  They're not designed for that.
[00:38:02.899 --> 00:38:07.260]  And are there women in a certain percentage point at the top that are incredible and can compete with some men?
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:07.580]  Yes.
[00:38:08.861 --> 00:38:12.421]  But that is a very, very small percentage of women and they can't compete against the best men.
[00:38:13.262 --> 00:38:14.922]  They can just compete against mediocre men.
[00:38:15.987 --> 00:38:24.370]  And we have the even weirder twist, where all the transgender men go into women's sports, wrestling, everything, and beat the living hell out of women, and then that's okay.
[00:38:24.971 --> 00:38:30.593]  In fact, Australia just passed a law, you can identify on your driver's license what your gender is and just switch your gender.
[00:38:31.133 --> 00:38:32.153]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:38:33.014 --> 00:38:36.135]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, this just broke at InfoWars.com.
[00:38:36.175 --> 00:38:39.236]  I was asking yesterday on air how long it would take for this to happen.
[00:38:39.276 --> 00:39:01.464]   You know, people like Jack Posobiec, openly, Got threatened with people, including that tranny US man, who is now the spokesperson for Ukraine, who got relieved from his command, her command, when he was saying, we're going to pay you a visit, and we're coming for you, Jack Posobiec.
[00:39:02.064 --> 00:39:07.289]  And you know, they've killed a lot of journalists, including one just recently.
[00:39:08.269 --> 00:39:09.851]  They tortured to death in prison.
[00:39:11.789 --> 00:39:14.070]  Gonzalo Lira show.
[00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:18.992]  Now they are threatening the Gonzalo Lira treatment.
[00:39:19.232 --> 00:39:20.753]  This is on Infowars.com.
[00:39:22.053 --> 00:39:22.593]  Just broke.
[00:39:23.634 --> 00:39:27.875]  Tucker Carlson now on Ukraine's kill list for interviewing Putin.
[00:39:28.836 --> 00:39:39.000]  Europe's European ally that Joe Biden has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to is openly targeting the lives of American citizens for simply asking questions.
[00:39:40.066 --> 00:39:41.626]  Well yeah, that's what the Democrats want to do here.
[00:39:41.646 --> 00:39:49.868]  Tucker Carlson is now included on Ukraine's kill list in response to interviewing Russian President Vladimir Putin that airs tomorrow night at 7 o'clock Central.
[00:39:50.748 --> 00:39:52.529]  And by the way, I'm just going to announce this now.
[00:39:53.569 --> 00:39:56.850]  I'm doing a special emergency broadcast.
[00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:58.310]  Tucker wants this free into the world.
[00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:07.592]  So as soon as the interview goes live tomorrow night at 7 Central, 8 Eastern, we will air the interview.
[00:40:09.232 --> 00:40:10.994]  And then we will have commentary after.
[00:40:11.995 --> 00:40:15.338]  So I'll go live at 6.30 tomorrow night.
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:18.421]  Right after the war room.
[00:40:19.782 --> 00:40:21.824]  And then I will give some commentary.
[00:40:22.064 --> 00:40:23.725]  I will stream it out on our network and our system.
[00:40:23.745 --> 00:40:25.907]  We will air the Putin interview.
[00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:31.012]  And then we will take questions and comments afterwards.
[00:40:31.032 --> 00:40:31.893]  Because this is historic.
[00:40:32.654 --> 00:40:33.895]  And Tiger Carlson's risk is life.
[00:40:36.414 --> 00:40:40.419]  The kill list is believed to be the product of the Ukraine Center for Countering Disinformation.
[00:40:40.459 --> 00:40:46.327]  Appears to have added Carlson Tuesday, shortly after he confirmed securing an interview with Putin.
[00:40:48.032 --> 00:40:49.973]  What pro-democracy folks they are!
[00:40:50.513 --> 00:40:56.154]  The Ukraine kill list was created by President Zelensky himself, with the backing of the American CIA and NATO itself.
[00:40:56.875 --> 00:41:00.836]  That's alarming given the kill list includes names of American citizens and citizens on NATO countries.
[00:41:01.476 --> 00:41:12.439]  As it turns out, the covert kill list website is the product of the Ukraine regime, effectively funded by the CIA amongst others, and is hosted by NATO's David Miller, and Mint Press News reported last May.
[00:41:13.979 --> 00:41:22.325]  One extraordinary thing is that many American citizens, including ex-military and intelligence operatives, are included as well as a significant number of citizens of NATO member countries.
[00:41:22.725 --> 00:41:29.369]  Perhaps the most remarkable element of the NATO has hosted the site and a collection of affiliated websites on its servers in Brussels.
[00:41:32.311 --> 00:41:34.092]  So what they do over there, they want to do here.
[00:41:34.112 --> 00:41:36.134]  They don't want to just stop at censorship.
[00:41:37.622 --> 00:41:42.203]  Hell, they push a vaccine that causes incredible amounts of cancer and heart attacks.
[00:41:42.223 --> 00:41:43.143]  I mean, of course they do.
[00:41:44.043 --> 00:41:45.544]  Just totally innocent people they want to kill.
[00:41:45.564 --> 00:41:47.944]  Of course they want to kill those of us that want World War III.
[00:41:48.644 --> 00:41:53.905]  Keep in mind, this is a nation the Joe Biden regime has sent and is still demanding.
[00:41:53.965 --> 00:41:58.326]  We send hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars to one that targets U.S.
[00:41:58.366 --> 00:42:01.087]  citizens who don't adhere to the official narrative.
[00:42:01.827 --> 00:42:06.613]   Ukraine is the only nation Fuming over Carlson's interview with Putin.
[00:42:07.193 --> 00:42:13.595]  The European Union is also melting down, threatening to impose sanctions on Tucker, which would bar him from visiting the continent or more.
[00:42:14.376 --> 00:42:19.277]  Putin is a war criminal and the EU sanctions all who assist him in that effort.
[00:42:19.698 --> 00:42:27.180]  It seems logical for the External Action Service to examine his case as well, said Belgian Prime Minister.
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:28.841]  And it goes on from there.
[00:42:31.089 --> 00:42:34.091]  Big article, only read the first two pages, it's like five pages long.
[00:42:34.532 --> 00:42:36.193]  It's on Infowars.com right now.
[00:42:36.213 --> 00:42:44.199]  And we've just posted it on X, formerly Twitter, so I hope you share that and I hope you support Tucker Carlson.
[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:49.924]  And as I said yesterday, right during this segment at the end of the first hour, he's risking his life.
[00:42:50.504 --> 00:42:53.024]  Make no mistake, this is serious business.
[00:42:53.024 --> 00:42:55.784]  Wow!
[00:42:55.784 --> 00:43:08.343]   Elon Musk has commented on members of the EU Parliament and the EU government saying they want him barred from Europe.
[00:43:09.284 --> 00:43:11.686]  Elon Musk said, if true, this would be disturbing indeed.
[00:43:11.746 --> 00:43:12.447]  It's now official.
[00:43:12.487 --> 00:43:12.927]  It is true.
[00:43:13.768 --> 00:43:21.294]  One may agree with Tucker or not, but he is a major American journalist and such an action would greatly offend the American people.
[00:43:24.737 --> 00:43:27.779]  Well, the interview airs tomorrow night, 1800 Washington time.
[00:43:31.974 --> 00:43:42.278]  We will be here covering it live at Infowars.com forward slash show and video on our radio and TV stations across the country that pick up our transmissions.
[00:43:45.319 --> 00:43:46.800]  All right, here's what I want to do.
[00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:58.584]  I've got a couple of clips here that I want to air and I want to talk about what you can really expect in this Tucker interview that's got them so scared.
[00:43:58.644 --> 00:44:01.907]   So get the clip of Putin, please.
[00:44:03.828 --> 00:44:12.154]  A year and a half ago saying he's been warning the world about US creating biological weapons in Ukraine and other areas and of course that's come out that that is true.
[00:44:12.694 --> 00:44:31.027]   Victoria Nuland, who really is the president of the dictatorship there, her puppet is the penis piano player, Zelensky, and she came out front of Congress and admitted, yeah, we have bioweapon labs there, months after they denied it.
[00:44:31.928 --> 00:44:35.690]  So how would you like it if Russia was in Canada building bioweapon labs?
[00:44:37.771 --> 00:44:38.751]  Again, I'm just saying.
[00:44:39.932 --> 00:44:40.412]  Here's Putin.
[00:44:41.474 --> 00:44:41.974]  Ukraine.
[00:44:42.935 --> 00:44:52.598]  There was a network of dozens of laboratories led by and financially supported by Pentagon and they were carrying out military biological programs.
[00:44:53.038 --> 00:45:04.842]  They were experimenting with the strains of coronavirus, anthrax, cholera, African pig plague and other deathly, lethal pathogens.
[00:45:05.562 --> 00:45:11.198]   And now they are trying to mop up The evidence of this program.
[00:45:11.238 --> 00:45:20.023]  But we have every reason to believe that next to Russia, in Ukraine, next to Russian borders, they were basically creating components for biological weapon.
[00:45:20.964 --> 00:45:28.208]  And our numerous warns that such developments have poses direct threat to the safety of Russia.
[00:45:28.668 --> 00:45:33.991]  They were rejected by Ukraine and by their patrons from the US.
[00:45:34.351 --> 00:45:37.153]  And they did it in a very brazen way.
[00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:41.511]  That's why they fear Putin.
[00:45:42.391 --> 00:45:49.911]   and Tucker told me it was an amazing interview over two hours and that he's just super excited.
[00:45:49.911 --> 00:45:59.110]   But just pull back for a minute and let it sink in for a second
[00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:04.471]  that we are so used to tyranny now.
[00:46:04.744 --> 00:46:06.564]  That where is the media?
[00:46:06.664 --> 00:46:08.685]  Where are journalists standing up for their own profession?
[00:46:09.465 --> 00:46:13.026]  Saying this is a long tradition, and this is a good thing he's done.
[00:46:13.086 --> 00:46:15.466]  Regardless, we should hear from all sides.
[00:46:17.187 --> 00:46:18.767]  Remember Osama Bin Laden at 9-11?
[00:46:18.787 --> 00:46:20.967]  They played all the videos of him talking about why he did it.
[00:46:21.268 --> 00:46:23.448]  Of course, he was really CIA, putting out propaganda.
[00:46:24.128 --> 00:46:29.809]  Wasn't what really happened, if you know the whole story, but... Everybody goes interviewing Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini.
[00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:32.570]  Hitler was interviewed during World War II.
[00:46:34.482 --> 00:46:37.824]  They'd show Hitler's speeches in newsreels at the movie theaters.
[00:46:38.024 --> 00:46:40.085]  People wanted, you know, Americans were like, here's what Hitler's saying.
[00:46:40.105 --> 00:46:44.126]  Because we were Americans, we got to hear what the other side was saying.
[00:46:45.007 --> 00:46:47.708]  When you're not allowed to hear what the other side's saying, you've got a big problem.
[00:46:48.008 --> 00:46:50.589]  And you can point at Russia and say they've got some controls and censorship too.
[00:46:50.909 --> 00:46:58.613]  But the West has far surpassed that now and can't point their finger at Russia and say, oh look, you know, you're the bad guys.
[00:47:00.113 --> 00:47:03.255]  Because who the Russians ban is foreign funded groups.
[00:47:04.659 --> 00:47:10.604]  So the CIA turns around and says, well, we'll just ban all the groups in America that aren't for World War III, and we'll claim you all work for Russia.
[00:47:10.864 --> 00:47:11.585]  Just one problem.
[00:47:11.725 --> 00:47:12.145]  I don't.
[00:47:12.726 --> 00:47:13.827]  Tucker Carlson doesn't.
[00:47:15.128 --> 00:47:17.650]  Tucker Carlson wants all the big interviews.
[00:47:18.631 --> 00:47:19.872]  You got Kevin Spacey.
[00:47:19.952 --> 00:47:23.795]  I mean, that's what Tucker Carlson does.
[00:47:24.355 --> 00:47:25.256]  You got Alex Jones.
[00:47:26.077 --> 00:47:27.318]  Not supposed to interview Alex Jones?
[00:47:27.698 --> 00:47:28.559]  Interview Alex Jones.
[00:47:30.049 --> 00:47:30.909]  Interview Elon Musk.
[00:47:31.309 --> 00:47:32.990]  Interview interesting people.
[00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:36.591]  That's what he went to journalism school for, was to be an interviewer.
[00:47:37.491 --> 00:47:38.972]  That's what he wanted to be when he was a little boy.
[00:47:38.992 --> 00:47:44.113]  And now he's interviewing Vladimir Putin and they're crapping all over themselves.
[00:47:44.133 --> 00:47:44.833]  I'm going to go on a break.
[00:47:45.433 --> 00:47:47.734]  Bring in a special guest to talk about the border situation.
[00:47:50.595 --> 00:47:52.835]  What's happening with Russia and more.
[00:47:52.896 --> 00:47:54.276]  Please remember we're Lister Supported.

[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:50.281]  We'll be right back.
[00:48:52.318 --> 00:48:53.580]  Gunther in Tennessee.
[00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:54.681]  Thanks for calling, Gunther.
[00:48:54.822 --> 00:48:55.162]  Hey, Alex.
[00:48:55.362 --> 00:48:56.084]  First time caller.
[00:48:56.104 --> 00:48:58.046]  Real quick, wanted to plug your Foundational Energy.
[00:48:58.587 --> 00:48:59.569]  Just started taking that.
[00:49:00.229 --> 00:49:04.536]  And with three pills, the recommended dose, I was bouncing off the walls.
[00:49:04.656 --> 00:49:10.243]   But I tell you, Foundational is the right name for that product because I'll cut down to one.
[00:49:10.683 --> 00:49:15.125]  It's like you have a baseline of energy that you were missing before that you got back.
[00:49:15.265 --> 00:49:23.790]  Well, I'm glad you mentioned that because it's methylfolate, the breakdown of folic acid, and a lot of people, particularly Europeans, don't absorb all of the folic acid.
[00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:25.130]  So it's not a stimulant.
[00:49:25.351 --> 00:49:28.752]  It's a totally natural thing that boosts energy that's foundational.
[00:49:29.052 --> 00:49:31.554]  And was I lying to you or did it not work?
[00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:33.510]  No, it was top-notch.
[00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:37.131]  And I was actually taking Red Pill Plus before, and that's got a little folic acid in it.
[00:49:37.211 --> 00:49:40.992]  I think there was a little buildup from this, but the energy from this was no jitters.
[00:49:41.172 --> 00:49:42.232]  I mean, it's top-notch.
[00:49:42.252 --> 00:49:42.932]  It's a great product.
[00:49:43.332 --> 00:49:44.293]  Well, thank you so much.
[00:49:44.333 --> 00:49:48.094]  Yeah, no, folic acid's great and is in Real Red Pill, but some can't break it down.
[00:49:48.134 --> 00:49:49.134]  This is the breakdown of it.
[00:49:49.194 --> 00:49:49.974]  That's exactly it.
[00:49:52.695 --> 00:49:54.435]  Well, I don't know what will happen now.
[00:49:55.882 --> 00:50:00.288]  We've got some difficult days ahead, but I'm not concerned about that now.
[00:50:02.191 --> 00:50:03.834]  I just want to do God's will.
[00:50:05.396 --> 00:50:08.540]  And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain.
[00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:15.992]   And I've looked The promised land.
[00:50:16.092 --> 00:50:26.846]  I may not get there with you, but I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land!
[00:50:28.769 --> 00:50:29.450]  We gotta come together.
[00:50:30.293 --> 00:50:34.494]  Whether you believe it or not, you've got to decide whether you have dominion over yourself.
[00:50:35.035 --> 00:50:48.179]  I believe that the majority of the plain people of the United States will, day in and day out, make fewer mistakes in governing themselves than any smaller class or body of men, no matter what their training, will make in trying to govern.
[00:50:48.199 --> 00:50:58.042]  And you've got to decide whether it's God that's going to have dominion over you, that you get orders from, or whether some other human that's jacked into the evil force is going to have dominion over you.
[00:50:58.618 --> 00:51:09.332]  What we're talking about now is like a second industrial revolution, but the product this time will not be textiles or machines or vehicles or even weapons.
[00:51:09.672 --> 00:51:12.916]  The product this time will be humans themselves.
[00:51:12.937 --> 00:51:15.139]  Do we want to have a human plan or a post-human plan?
[00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:22.326]  Noval Harari and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates say humans are obsolete, we're scum, because they know we are their competition.
[00:51:22.647 --> 00:51:28.552]  They know that if we go for what we want and what God wants to have, they can't compete with that transmission.
[00:51:28.893 --> 00:51:30.334]  They can't compete with that blueprint.
[00:51:30.574 --> 00:51:32.116]  They can't compete with that architecture.
[00:51:32.496 --> 00:51:34.778]  They can't compete with that master plan.
[00:51:35.339 --> 00:51:36.320]  But I just see it now.
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:37.941]  It'll be so clear soon.
[00:51:38.421 --> 00:51:40.222]  Are you pro-human or are you anti-human?
[00:51:40.603 --> 00:51:43.705]  You are the human resistance to this alien takeover.
[00:51:44.105 --> 00:51:51.410]  And again, when I say alien takeover, I don't mean some little tinfoil flying saucer crashing in Roswell from Alpha Centauri.
[00:51:51.931 --> 00:52:01.738]  I'm talking about the transmission in the universe of God's order and God's will, or do you choose to serve the agents of death?
[00:52:02.618 --> 00:52:05.480]  And like Martin Luther King said, we're not going to judge them off what color they are.
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:10.623]  We're going to judge them off of the character of their actions and deeds.
[00:52:11.403 --> 00:52:13.245]  I'm going to say it right now, real clear.
[00:52:13.825 --> 00:52:17.107]  I love everybody, no matter what color your beautiful skin is.
[00:52:17.667 --> 00:52:20.169]  But I care about your heart and your guts and your mind.
[00:52:20.689 --> 00:52:22.490]  And you're under attack by these Satanists.
[00:52:22.690 --> 00:52:23.851]  And they want to kill you!
[00:52:23.871 --> 00:52:25.552]  And they want to kill your children!
[00:52:25.572 --> 00:52:28.214]  And I say we set our differences aside.
[00:52:28.954 --> 00:52:38.416]  And I say we come together and we beat these people and we smash their technocracy and we build the future together and we can do anything with our real diversity.
[00:52:39.056 --> 00:52:41.057]  These enemies tell us all day about diversity.
[00:52:41.317 --> 00:52:44.698]  They mean divided and conquered groups of people separate from each other.
[00:52:45.118 --> 00:52:50.379]  This bill is supported by all of the Democrats, House and Senate.
[00:52:51.179 --> 00:52:53.160]  It's just a filibuster in a way.
[00:52:54.062 --> 00:53:07.976]  So in a way, if you really truly want to honor Dr. King, don't dishonor him by using a congressional custom as an excuse for protecting our democracy.
[00:53:08.016 --> 00:53:12.921]  But I tell you, if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.
[00:53:13.102 --> 00:53:14.803]  I want unity.
[00:53:15.865 --> 00:53:23.329]  Under a code of freedom, and liberty, and justice, and coming together, and working together, and being strong.
[00:53:23.649 --> 00:53:31.993]  And that's what InfoWars is, and that's why the enemies of humanity hate us so much, because we love God!
[00:53:32.674 --> 00:53:34.215]  And God loves humanity!
[00:53:35.055 --> 00:53:38.017]  And I am a human supremacist!
[00:53:38.517 --> 00:53:49.517]  I am a human supremacist!
[00:53:49.625 --> 00:53:53.969]  That term will be the future war with the robots and the AI.
[00:53:54.149 --> 00:53:58.733]  What you're hearing now is the entire future and everything they tried to stop us from doing.
[00:53:59.154 --> 00:54:01.656]  Our supremacy will not end with this planet.
[00:54:02.236 --> 00:54:03.998]  We will keep all the stars.
[00:54:04.138 --> 00:54:05.099]  We will colonize.
[00:54:05.279 --> 00:54:07.121]  We will green dead worlds.
[00:54:07.581 --> 00:54:08.902]  We will go interdimensional.
[00:54:09.102 --> 00:54:10.663]  We will unlock the secrets of the universe.
[00:54:10.923 --> 00:54:13.484]  God has laid them out like Christmas presents for his children.
[00:54:13.804 --> 00:54:24.410]  And I am extremely honored to be in the fulcrum and the heart of the fight to bring our race, the human race, in a race for the future.
[00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:35.621]  And we will break the enemy, we will break the pedophiles, we will break the Satanists, because God already sent his own self down here to show us he could do it!
[00:54:36.221 --> 00:54:39.965]  God would never ask us to go through an obstacle course he wouldn't go through!
[00:54:39.985 --> 00:54:47.052]  And now we're gonna go through what Christ did, and we're gonna go through it, and we're gonna be destroyed, but reborn on the other side!
[00:54:50.851 --> 00:55:01.981]  Well, she's a great talk show host and filmmaker, been a guest on my show many times years ago, and we've been working with her some now on documentaries and more.
[00:55:02.041 --> 00:55:03.162]  Very, very exciting lady.
[00:55:03.743 --> 00:55:07.686]  And she was coming into town to talk to us about filmmaking, and I said, why don't you just come on the show?
[00:55:08.507 --> 00:55:16.073]  And so she was here yesterday, but then I had an emergency come up and I had to leave in the fourth hour, so she stayed over, even though she was flying out last night to be with us.
[00:55:16.473 --> 00:55:22.598]  She's at Lauren Whiskey DE on X as well, and it's great to be here with you.
[00:55:23.151 --> 00:55:24.251]  Thank you so much for having me.
[00:55:24.291 --> 00:55:25.372]  It's a complete honor.
[00:55:25.392 --> 00:55:26.412]  Well, it's an honor to have you.
[00:55:26.432 --> 00:55:27.793]  I've never met you in person until yesterday.
[00:55:28.613 --> 00:55:33.075]  You came wanting to talk about the border when I asked you to come on the show, and then we got plenty of that today.
[00:55:33.115 --> 00:55:34.295]  But what do you make of Tucker?
[00:55:34.315 --> 00:55:36.496]  This is a lot bigger than just Tucker Carlson or Vladimir Putin.
[00:55:37.016 --> 00:55:45.159]  The fact that our own corporate media is trying to say he shouldn't do this, now they've put him on the Ukrainian government hit list that NATO hosts the servers for, and it's running.
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:48.241]  This is next-level outrageous.
[00:55:48.261 --> 00:55:49.541]  There should be congressional hearings.
[00:55:50.521 --> 00:55:51.702]  Biden should be impeached for this.
[00:55:53.191 --> 00:55:54.051]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:55:54.131 --> 00:55:57.812]  So, you know, remember when they kicked Tucker off of Fox News in the first place?
[00:55:58.272 --> 00:56:01.233]  It was because of his coverage of the Ukraine war.
[00:56:01.533 --> 00:56:02.693]  He was getting too close.
[00:56:03.393 --> 00:56:04.953]  And they spied on him.
[00:56:04.973 --> 00:56:12.015]  They ended up hacking into his phone, reading his text messages, reporting him.
[00:56:12.155 --> 00:56:15.456]  The one thing that they did not want to happen was this interview.
[00:56:15.956 --> 00:56:19.695]   And that's because Putin knows where all the bodies are buried.
[00:56:19.735 --> 00:56:22.277]  He knows about the Ukraine bioweapons labs.
[00:56:22.337 --> 00:56:23.919]  He knows about the truth about the war.
[00:56:23.939 --> 00:56:35.568]  While he's been busy doing his, while Zelensky's been busy doing his rounds for Vogue magazine begging for money, Putin has practiced extreme restraint during this war.
[00:56:35.649 --> 00:56:39.532]  And that's something that I think people are going to learn with this Tucker interview tonight.
[00:56:40.472 --> 00:56:41.213]  Very well said.
[00:56:41.253 --> 00:56:46.276]  Let's expand on your views on Putin and Ukraine and where all this is going.
[00:56:46.316 --> 00:56:49.058]  And now Tucker being put on the death list.
[00:56:49.118 --> 00:56:53.621]  And about six months ago, Jack Posobiec was put on it for criticizing Zelensky.
[00:56:54.342 --> 00:57:00.726]  And they openly had that man who claims he's a woman, who was their main spokesperson, say, we're coming for you.
[00:57:01.247 --> 00:57:02.387]  But it took a few months, but U.S.
[00:57:02.407 --> 00:57:03.328]  senators got involved.
[00:57:03.748 --> 00:57:05.149]  That individual got fired over this.
[00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:05.730]  Yes.
[00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:07.951]  So this is, I mean, even the Senate gets this big deal.
[00:57:08.332 --> 00:57:10.053]  Now they're threatening to kill Tucker Carlson.
[00:57:11.346 --> 00:57:18.773]  Yep, and they're talking about sanctioning him so he can't even come back into the country, sanctioning him in Europe.
[00:57:19.394 --> 00:57:22.116]  They are trying to do everything they can to prevent this from being aired.
[00:57:22.316 --> 00:57:31.886]  But you know what, whether you like it or not, tomorrow at 6, I'm told tomorrow at 6pm, they are going to be releasing the Putin interview and it's going to change everything.
[00:57:32.266 --> 00:57:33.708]  What is 1800 Washington?
[00:57:35.973 --> 00:57:36.113]  What?
[00:57:37.435 --> 00:57:41.940]  Tomorrow evening we'll get all that out and we'll be here covering it live.
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:48.047]  But, you know, sitting here looking at this, when I was being deplatformed and demonized everywhere, people said, how are you taking it?
[00:57:48.067 --> 00:57:51.631]  And I said, I know I'm just a beta test because I'd read the NATO plans.
[00:57:51.931 --> 00:57:56.835]   Funny enough, NATO was involved kind of hatching The censorship plan that was then adopted by the U.S.
[00:57:56.916 --> 00:57:57.836]  Because the U.S.
[00:57:57.856 --> 00:58:03.079]  likes to commit crimes internationally where they think they're safer from congressional oversight than they bring the plan here.
[00:58:03.459 --> 00:58:06.281]  But I remember six years ago reading NATO plans.
[00:58:06.741 --> 00:58:11.364]  We're going to first censor Julian Assange while he was in jail, and we're going to get Alex Jones as well.
[00:58:11.744 --> 00:58:14.686]  And once we get those two, the left and right won't stand up for them.
[00:58:15.147 --> 00:58:16.307]  The president will then be set.
[00:58:16.367 --> 00:58:21.050]  Well, now they're going after, well, the only fish that's bigger and that's Tucker Carlson.
[00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:22.311]  This is a beta test.
[00:58:22.728 --> 00:58:23.348]  Yes, yes.
[00:58:23.569 --> 00:58:27.351]  And what they're doing to him, you don't think that they're going to do to the rest of us.
[00:58:27.891 --> 00:58:33.234]  Now, Tucker, he ended up losing his job with Fox News because he was covering the war so fairly.
[00:58:33.254 --> 00:58:39.458]  And then you see the freakout when he goes to Russia and gets the interview himself.
[00:58:39.878 --> 00:58:44.081]  Because he is, you know, we get propaganda, we get propaganda here.
[00:58:44.101 --> 00:58:48.824]  We get whatever the regime, the military-industrial complex wants us to know.
[00:58:49.464 --> 00:58:53.007]  And it's a shame because we basically have government-ran media.
[00:58:53.327 --> 00:58:54.768]  We don't get to know the truth.
[00:58:54.828 --> 00:59:00.711]  But Tucker going directly to Putin, someone who empowered the church in his country.
[00:59:01.372 --> 00:59:05.394]  He brought the church up right next to him and empowered Christians in his country.
[00:59:05.735 --> 00:59:07.616]  And Zelensky's family Orthodox Church.
[00:59:07.796 --> 00:59:16.499]  Yes, and then Zelensky, on the other hand, is arresting Ukrainian Orthodox Church members because they might have a connection to Russia.
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:34.776]   And it's kind of evident, it's very evident, while Zelensky has a transgender spokesperson lecturing us on the evils of Putin, Putin is calling America, like calling out America for Well, remember when he called us, I think, the Great Satan or something?
[00:59:36.838 --> 00:59:41.461]  What he said was the American people have an elite bombarding them with anti-family evil.
[00:59:41.502 --> 00:59:41.722]  Yes.
[00:59:41.882 --> 00:59:42.923]  They're trying to destroy their family.
[00:59:43.163 --> 00:59:43.663]  Yes, yeah.
[00:59:43.864 --> 00:59:47.747]  And he said basically that the United States is run by pedophiles, which is true.
[00:59:48.027 --> 00:59:48.828]  Yes, and it's true.
[00:59:48.908 --> 00:59:49.408]  They're watching.
[00:59:49.428 --> 00:59:53.291]  The world is watching as we are grooming little children, letting drag queens read to our kids.
[00:59:53.572 --> 00:59:56.834]  And it's embarrassing, because we used to be a strong country.
[00:59:56.854 --> 00:59:58.996]  Other countries used to respect us.
[00:59:59.076 --> 01:00:02.359]  I mean, no matter what, you respect Russia and their power structure.
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:06.882]  Well, this is a lot bigger than Tucker, as I keep saying.
[01:00:06.902 --> 01:00:08.524]  It's a lens through which we see everything.
[01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:26.585]  And the fact that they're putting him on a kill list, the fact that the EU is openly saying they want to sanction him, and it looks like they're moving forward with that, and that the left and right corporate media is attacking him for this, it really shows how bad these people really are, and what they would do to us if they could get away with it.
[01:00:26.925 --> 01:00:31.006]  I know I keep saying that, but that's, I mean, they're not playing games here.
[01:00:31.486 --> 01:00:31.686]  Right.
[01:00:31.826 --> 01:00:35.668]  And, you know, we've seen a little bit about what they will do if they can get away with it.
[01:00:35.728 --> 01:00:36.768]  We still have J6ers.
[01:00:37.168 --> 01:00:39.529]  Sitting in the gulag without due process.
[01:00:39.769 --> 01:00:41.090]  There are no rules anymore.
[01:00:41.570 --> 01:00:43.911]  It's just whatever they say goes.
[01:00:43.971 --> 01:00:46.532]  The laws of America don't matter anymore.
[01:00:46.632 --> 01:00:49.533]  It's whatever the regime chooses to do to you.
[01:00:49.713 --> 01:00:53.715]  And they get away with it, too, because what they did was they played the long game.
[01:00:53.755 --> 01:00:56.796]  They put their people in positions of power slowly.
[01:00:56.816 --> 01:00:57.896]  They were very patient.
[01:00:58.376 --> 01:01:08.643]   And in the courts, in the White House, in The legislature and then they put their people there and installed them so they can do whatever they want to us.
[01:01:08.783 --> 01:01:10.845]  And we weren't prepared for it, I don't think.
[01:01:11.205 --> 01:01:12.906]  But I don't think it's all hopeless.
[01:01:12.926 --> 01:01:18.751]  I think that if something happens to Tucker Carlson, it's going to spark a global outrage.
[01:01:19.672 --> 01:01:20.613]  Well, exactly.
[01:01:20.673 --> 01:01:21.654]  He's loved all over the world.
[01:01:22.554 --> 01:01:24.576]  And it shows how popular Liberty is.
[01:01:25.016 --> 01:01:30.080]  He tells me, other people tell me, I don't go to Europe a lot because I'm so busy that people bring this show up a lot to them.
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.542]  And that's what the Tate brothers tell me.
[01:01:32.884 --> 01:01:34.325]  I don't see that as, oh great, I'm famous.
[01:01:34.405 --> 01:01:35.887]  It means people are resonating.
[01:01:36.407 --> 01:01:37.428]  I talk about that lens.
[01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:41.812]  I noticed that when he left Fox, he had an average of about 4 or 5 million viewers.
[01:01:41.832 --> 01:01:46.196]  And then they were suppressing the clips out of Fox so it wasn't getting a lot of views online.
[01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:48.057]  Maybe 5 million online every day.
[01:01:48.077 --> 01:01:49.598]  So maybe 10 million viewers a day maximum.
[01:01:50.319 --> 01:01:53.782]  And he's had many interviews with Trump, 300 million views.
[01:01:54.283 --> 01:01:55.884]  Other interviews with 50 million, 100 million.
[01:01:57.245 --> 01:01:57.906]  Things like that.
[01:01:58.766 --> 01:02:03.309]  His average interview, because he does so many, 10 million, conservatively, just on X, and it gets picked up everywhere.
[01:02:04.110 --> 01:02:09.714]  So he at least tripled or quadrupled his audience, but I see the headlines, oh, he's that internet host.
[01:02:10.094 --> 01:02:17.619]  Well, it's all the internet hosts, the Alex Jones, the Joe Rogans, the Russell Brands, the Tucker Carlsons, that have the bigger audiences.
[01:02:17.659 --> 01:02:25.445]  I mean, despite all their censorship and all their control, this broadcast, with all of our stations and everything combined, let's be conservative, 10 million a day.
[01:02:25.985 --> 01:02:27.667]  Okay, well CNN's top show has a million.
[01:02:28.127 --> 01:02:31.810]  So they act like because they're an old dinosaur and they're still on TV.
[01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:33.652]  Oh look, you're not on our thing.
[01:02:33.672 --> 01:02:36.734]  You're not in our... It's like you drive by a pigsty.
[01:02:36.754 --> 01:02:38.055]  They're like, you're not in our pigsty.
[01:02:38.075 --> 01:02:40.157]  You're not... It's a mind game.
[01:02:40.537 --> 01:02:44.621]  But no one's even buying it, I think, except the talking heads or maybe they even know what a joke they are.
[01:02:44.921 --> 01:02:48.345]  No, I mean, digital media is next.
[01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:51.548]  The mainstream cable news, it's dying.
[01:02:51.728 --> 01:02:53.009]  And it's dying very quickly.
[01:02:53.169 --> 01:02:53.930]  And they know it.
[01:02:54.350 --> 01:02:58.034]  So they're freaking out because people are becoming their own journalists.
[01:02:58.375 --> 01:03:04.601]  We the people have become journalists because we can put out information, do our own investigations, and expose the truth.
[01:03:04.681 --> 01:03:06.603]  And they are terrified of that.
[01:03:06.963 --> 01:03:15.047]  And they're realizing that as people move over from network television, you know, Tucker was limited to, what was it, 4 million views a night?
[01:03:15.067 --> 01:03:15.447]  Yeah.
[01:03:15.567 --> 01:03:21.610]  That's limited, you know, because unless you have a subscription to Fox News or cable, you don't really get access to his information.
[01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:25.312]  Moving to... And nothing against old people, the average age is 75.
[01:03:25.972 --> 01:03:27.053]  Now he's reaching the young people.
[01:03:27.233 --> 01:03:27.433]  Yes.
[01:03:27.894 --> 01:03:30.015]  And that generation is kind of moving on.
[01:03:30.295 --> 01:03:33.378]  You know, they're passing away and it's going to be us next.
[01:03:33.418 --> 01:03:34.819]  And who's going to carry that torch?
[01:03:35.199 --> 01:03:42.645]  Well, it's got to be us younger folks who are making media outlets, are investigating, doing our own journalism.
[01:03:43.146 --> 01:03:45.788]  And anybody could get as many views as Tucker Carlson.
[01:03:45.868 --> 01:03:47.229]  And if we build it, they will come.
[01:03:47.249 --> 01:03:48.210]  And let's expand on that.
[01:03:49.608 --> 01:03:54.291]  Tucker, this is something I need to do more of, because it was successful years ago, but I just get so pinned down here.
[01:03:55.151 --> 01:03:57.713]  He probably does three speaking engagements a week.
[01:03:57.753 --> 01:03:58.373]  He's a workhorse.
[01:03:59.334 --> 01:04:08.579]  And those speaking engagements, everybody shoots video on their phones, and the group that hosts him puts it out, and it almost always gets 5, 10, 20, 30 million views.
[01:04:11.129 --> 01:04:13.872]  It's not just the big network with the fancy studio and all that.
[01:04:13.912 --> 01:04:14.672]  That's all fine and dandy.
[01:04:14.693 --> 01:04:15.373]  We've got that too.
[01:04:15.974 --> 01:04:20.298]  It's that, it's him rallying the troops, giving speeches just like Trump does.
[01:04:20.838 --> 01:04:24.942]  I mean, he was just in Canada to crowds of 20, 30, 40,000 people.
[01:04:25.323 --> 01:04:25.483]  Right.
[01:04:25.663 --> 01:04:29.607]  So again, we're gushing over Tucker because the enemy is pulling their hair out over him.
[01:04:29.927 --> 01:04:30.988]  He's what they fear.
[01:04:31.349 --> 01:04:32.530]  He's the model of the future.
[01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:34.231]  No, he absolutely is.
[01:04:34.291 --> 01:04:37.073]  And I hope many more people follow suit as well.
[01:04:37.933 --> 01:04:40.455]  Like I said, they're terrified because he's putting his stuff out there.
[01:04:40.495 --> 01:04:42.576]  It's accessible to everybody.
[01:04:42.676 --> 01:04:48.160]  So they're all wondering, what exactly did Tucker and Putin say to each other?
[01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:53.623]  Because they're already trying to paint this picture that it's a propaganda piece to build up Russia.
[01:04:53.803 --> 01:04:55.705]  And now Tucker's a traitor.
[01:04:55.865 --> 01:04:59.147]  And we're going to find out ourselves the truth because they're going to put it out there.
[01:04:59.607 --> 01:05:01.068]  And that's what scares them the most.
[01:05:01.228 --> 01:05:02.049]  Well, let me make a prediction.
[01:05:03.919 --> 01:05:10.404]  They're going to cover the bio-weapon labs, they're going to cover the real history of what happened in Ukraine, they're going to cover the moral decline in the West, they're going to cover the censorship.
[01:05:10.824 --> 01:05:14.727]  And Tucker will ask a few hard questions, like you've been accused of killing this person, that person, respond to that.
[01:05:15.848 --> 01:05:21.512]  But the reason they're scared of this is, we already have all these other viral clips of Putin.
[01:05:23.149 --> 01:05:23.890]  Exposing things.
[01:05:23.950 --> 01:05:25.751]  But now it's just going to be magnified.
[01:05:26.031 --> 01:05:28.734]  But what they really hate is they don't have the control.
[01:05:29.094 --> 01:05:32.036]  They fired him to try to make him go away.
[01:05:32.437 --> 01:05:33.538]  And now he's much bigger.
[01:05:33.858 --> 01:05:37.581]  Just like InfoWars got bigger when they tried to shut us down.
[01:05:37.781 --> 01:05:38.442]  No, it's true.
[01:05:38.522 --> 01:05:40.603]  And you know, it's great to see you back on Twitter.
[01:05:40.623 --> 01:05:41.324]  I follow your account.
[01:05:41.344 --> 01:05:42.785]  I think it's absolutely great.
[01:05:43.246 --> 01:05:44.527]  And it's... Hypos and alls.
[01:05:44.607 --> 01:05:45.968]  It's me on there, folks.
[01:05:46.128 --> 01:05:46.628]  I love it.
[01:05:46.668 --> 01:05:47.129]  I love it.
[01:05:47.189 --> 01:05:50.692]  But no, it's an expansion of our reach is what it is.
[01:05:50.732 --> 01:05:56.792]   And the fact that Elon Musk bought Twitter, or X, and renamed it X, you know, it was,
[01:05:56.792 --> 01:06:01.713]   they kicked and screamed the whole time to try to make sure that didn't happen.
[01:06:01.713 --> 01:06:05.633]   Because now it's a free flow of information, it's a different time, and it's up to us to
[01:06:05.633 --> 01:06:08.233]  continue to expose the truth and government corruption.
[01:06:08.233 --> 01:06:14.513]   And that's why they're kind of freaking out and closing in on us, they're hunting down,
[01:06:14.513 --> 01:06:18.633]   Department of Homeland Security is hunting down patriots who believe the election is
[01:06:19.014 --> 01:06:21.276]  They're putting them on domestic terrorist watch lists.
[01:06:21.516 --> 01:06:26.939]  They're trying to scare us into thinking that, oh, I better not speak up about this, because that's all they have left.
[01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:29.201]  Because we are sharing the truth.
[01:06:29.241 --> 01:06:30.822]  We are getting information out there.
[01:06:31.142 --> 01:06:41.849]  And they'll continue to kind of pull in that stranglehold on patriots and dissidents and people who do real journalism in an attempt to try and stop us.
[01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:42.670]  But it won't work.
[01:06:42.970 --> 01:06:45.872]  By the way, I've got a clip of Putin two years ago.
[01:06:45.892 --> 01:06:48.014]  He's being interviewed by NBC News.
[01:06:48.034 --> 01:06:49.015]  We'll play this in a moment.
[01:06:51.294 --> 01:06:52.915]  Two and a half years ago, NBC interviewed Putin.
[01:06:52.935 --> 01:06:53.656]  It didn't go well.
[01:06:54.056 --> 01:06:58.499]  That's why they've been trying to sabotage the Tucker interview that is coming out.
[01:06:58.779 --> 01:07:00.300]  And I love Tucker's crew, know them well.
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:06.123]  But they love to wait on an interview and add clips and massage it and get it ready.
[01:07:06.163 --> 01:07:09.305]  And I called them and I said, I'm sure they already knew to do this.
[01:07:09.325 --> 01:07:11.867]  I'm not saying it was, I did this, but I put a video out too.
[01:07:11.907 --> 01:07:14.489]  And I said, you got to release this right now.
[01:07:15.325 --> 01:07:17.486]  Because the longer you sit on it, the more danger you're in.
[01:07:17.526 --> 01:07:20.408]  Because again, it's a symbol of the globalists losing control.
[01:07:20.748 --> 01:07:28.152]  And just like they blew up the Nord Stream Pipeline, even though it demonized them to the world, they still wanted to say, we're in charge.
[01:07:28.753 --> 01:07:34.316]  It's like a woman trying to leave a guy that breaks her jar, puts cigarettes out on her.
[01:07:34.356 --> 01:07:37.057]  They're trying to stop us from getting in the car and driving away.
[01:07:37.658 --> 01:07:40.059]  Here's Putin stopping NBC dead in their tracks.
[01:07:41.247 --> 01:07:43.048]  Let me just ask you a direct question.
[01:07:43.128 --> 01:07:45.710]  Did you order Alexei Navalny's assassination?
[01:07:49.752 --> 01:07:50.492]  Of course not.
[01:07:51.033 --> 01:07:54.475]  We don't have this kind of habit of assassinating anybody.
[01:07:54.555 --> 01:07:55.055]  That's one.
[01:07:56.336 --> 01:08:04.641]  Number two is, I want to ask you, did you order the assassination of the woman who walked into the Congress and who was shot and killed by a policeman?
[01:08:05.101 --> 01:08:05.921]  Do you know that 400...
[01:08:07.362 --> 01:08:12.586]  450 individuals were arrested after entering the Congress, and they didn't go there to steal a laptop.
[01:08:13.307 --> 01:08:16.449]  They came with political demands.
[01:08:16.469 --> 01:08:18.151]  450 people have been detained.
[01:08:18.171 --> 01:08:19.832]  You're talking about a capital punishment?
[01:08:19.872 --> 01:08:28.899]  They're looking at jail time between 15 and 25 years, and they came to the Congress with political demands.
[01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:31.742]  Isn't that persecution for political opinions?
[01:08:35.066 --> 01:08:36.269]  And he said that two and a half years ago.
[01:08:36.289 --> 01:08:38.573]  Now it's like 1,400 people charged, 1,000.
[01:08:39.155 --> 01:08:43.003]  Some people are getting five-year jail terms for walking between velvet ropes.
[01:08:43.504 --> 01:08:45.047]  I mean, imagine if the Russians were doing that.
[01:08:45.067 --> 01:08:45.728]  We'd be like, whoa.
[01:08:46.215 --> 01:08:51.741]  Right, no, I didn't even go in the Capitol and they put me on the domestic terrorist watch list every time I went to go fly.
[01:08:51.761 --> 01:08:54.584]  I had to be escorted by Homeland Security.
[01:08:54.644 --> 01:08:59.509]  They had to swab my hands for explosives and then I had to do it all over again at my connecting flights.
[01:08:59.550 --> 01:09:05.816]  They really tried to make us, like our lives, a living hell because they were scared of that uprising that happened on J6.
[01:09:05.856 --> 01:09:08.039]  They do not want the people to rebel.
[01:09:08.399 --> 01:09:10.401]  Well, they're lucky we didn't.
[01:09:10.421 --> 01:09:13.064]  They say that was our planned thing.
[01:09:13.425 --> 01:09:15.067]  No, that was them setting us up.
[01:09:15.447 --> 01:09:17.209]  Imagine if a million people did show up with guns.
[01:09:17.670 --> 01:09:18.410]  Yeah, it's true.
[01:09:18.430 --> 01:09:21.854]  And I'm not saying do that, but I'm just saying, careful what they claim is going on.
[01:09:22.075 --> 01:09:23.276]  Yeah, calling it an insurrection.
[01:09:23.176 --> 01:09:25.655]  when nobody came armed, nobody came prepared.
[01:09:25.655 --> 01:09:27.475]  We were there to make our voices heard.
[01:09:27.475 --> 01:09:31.876]   Everybody there was there to protest what was happening with the electors and
[01:09:31.876 --> 01:09:35.836]   securing the electors and they wanted their voices to be heard.
[01:09:35.836 --> 01:09:40.096]   And of course, very typical of Congress to completely ignore the people's concerns
[01:09:40.096 --> 01:09:42.316]  and move forward with their agenda.
[01:09:42.316 --> 01:09:46.076]  And I like how Putin mentioned Ashley Babbitt.
[01:09:46.076 --> 01:09:48.916]  People call him a tyrant and a murderer and assassin.
[01:09:49.393 --> 01:10:05.630]  And we, our own government, shot an innocent woman in cold blood, an unarmed woman, just for, you know, she was in the Capitol, yes, but it was, there was no... And it turns out the federal cop that shot her thought he was being shot at.
[01:10:07.012 --> 01:10:08.353]  He just made that up.
[01:10:08.573 --> 01:10:10.254]  Yeah, he just made it up.
[01:10:10.914 --> 01:10:12.035]  He just made that up.
[01:10:12.095 --> 01:10:13.917]  He, you know, was a quick trigger.
[01:10:13.937 --> 01:10:18.480]  They wanted to set an example, you know, because after that, the protest kind of died down.
[01:10:18.941 --> 01:10:20.161]  But at what cost?
[01:10:20.322 --> 01:10:23.764]  They murdered one of our own and then hunted down others.
[01:10:23.864 --> 01:10:25.926]  Other people were killed on that day as well.
[01:10:26.086 --> 01:10:28.228]  Police brutality, being smothered.
[01:10:28.728 --> 01:10:29.728]  Five people.
[01:10:29.728 --> 01:10:30.728]  Five people, yep.
[01:10:30.728 --> 01:10:33.447]  And we can't forget what they did to us.
[01:10:33.447 --> 01:10:38.487]   We can't forget how they treated us because, like you said, you think it's just going to
[01:10:38.487 --> 01:10:39.807]  be limited to MAGA people?
[01:10:39.807 --> 01:10:44.007]   No, it's going to expand into anybody with a dissident opinion.
[01:10:44.007 --> 01:10:47.488]  Anybody who may be a little right of center.
[01:10:47.488 --> 01:10:51.688]   And they will eventually take more and more territory and come after more and more of
[01:10:51.688 --> 01:10:55.926]   us until we, well, that's their plan, but they won't succeed.
[01:10:56.010 --> 01:10:56.771]  They won't get that far.
[01:10:56.791 --> 01:10:58.111]  I think people are starting to wake up.
[01:10:58.431 --> 01:11:01.532]  I think people are starting to wake up about what really happened on J6.
[01:11:01.773 --> 01:11:04.093]  They're starting to wake up about the truth about the war.
[01:11:04.874 --> 01:11:09.956]  Public opinion of more foreign aid for Ukraine started plummeting.
[01:11:10.236 --> 01:11:18.019]  Like they could not get, like the Congress started worrying about their constituency because nobody wanted to send another dime to Ukraine.
[01:11:18.039 --> 01:11:24.043]   And now they're trying to tie Yeah, and they're like, okay, well, our people want border security.
[01:11:24.083 --> 01:11:30.688]  So in order for you to have border security, you're going to have to give, what was it, 40 billion to Ukraine?
[01:11:30.808 --> 01:11:35.992]  I think it was some ridiculous number, but it was three times more than what they had offered for the border.
[01:11:36.012 --> 01:11:37.013]  Yeah, I've got the numbers right here.
[01:11:37.033 --> 01:11:37.654]  We can go over those.
[01:11:37.894 --> 01:11:38.995]  Let's play this clip here.
[01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:42.532]  That's what Patrick McDavid said, call it the Ukraine bill.
[01:11:42.872 --> 01:11:43.472]  Yeah.
[01:11:43.552 --> 01:11:44.373]  It's not the border bill.
[01:11:44.933 --> 01:11:51.098]  But then it gives billions to the NGOs to keep bringing the illegal aliens in, and it makes Biden basically a dictator over the border.
[01:11:51.578 --> 01:11:52.359]  Let's play this clip.
[01:11:52.419 --> 01:11:59.063]  Biden, I wear my Ukraine tie, my Ukraine pin, which I've been wearing because they're in dire straits.
[01:11:59.704 --> 01:12:01.425]  I thought they kicked the Russians' asses.
[01:12:02.366 --> 01:12:03.827]  I thought that it was a cakewalk.
[01:12:04.247 --> 01:12:06.128]  No, this war... I mean, notice suddenly...
[01:12:08.542 --> 01:12:11.926]  Ukraine's invincible, blah blah blah, and all of a sudden, oh no, Ukraine's in dire straits.
[01:12:12.587 --> 01:12:21.056]  Yeah, so Ukraine, Zelensky would have surrendered two years ago and saved hundreds of thousands of lives had the U.S.
[01:12:21.297 --> 01:12:29.886]   not gotten involved and started funding it, providing military aid, we're sending our own Our own, some of our own people over there.
[01:12:30.486 --> 01:12:33.509]  And it would have ended a long time ago had they not had our support.
[01:12:33.549 --> 01:12:36.291]  Hundreds of thousands of people would have, still be alive.
[01:12:36.311 --> 01:12:39.414]  You know, it is a white Christian slaughter over there in Ukraine.
[01:12:39.454 --> 01:12:41.876]  It never should have escalated into this.
[01:12:42.417 --> 01:12:45.760]  So... And Natal Braggs, Victoria Nolan Braggs, she started the whole thing.
[01:12:46.488 --> 01:12:50.369]  Yeah, I mean, it's just, it's just, this whole war has been a ginormous lie.
[01:12:50.809 --> 01:12:55.490]  And every time Zelensky, we ever hear from him, it's just when he's begging for more money.
[01:12:55.510 --> 01:13:00.570]  And you remember when he said, you know, he was like, well, if you can't give us money, give us credit, you know, and we'll pay you back.
[01:13:00.690 --> 01:13:02.171]  Do you think we're ever going to get that money back?
[01:13:02.191 --> 01:13:04.891]  He also said, if you don't give us money, it'll be your sons and daughters.
[01:13:04.931 --> 01:13:05.571]  Yes, yes.
[01:13:05.631 --> 01:13:07.051]  And they threatened that as well.
[01:13:07.072 --> 01:13:07.772]  They threatened us.
[01:13:07.792 --> 01:13:09.052]  They threatened us into paying them.
[01:13:09.072 --> 01:13:13.513]  But about three years ago, when Soros could still talk, maybe they can find the club, they only played it once.
[01:13:13.533 --> 01:13:15.353]  And I was thinking about the other day, I go, God, that clip's incredible.
[01:13:16.013 --> 01:13:18.074]  He was on NPR or something.
[01:13:18.114 --> 01:13:19.775]  He's like, I told them.
[01:13:21.836 --> 01:13:22.536]  Now I can't even talk.
[01:13:23.756 --> 01:13:33.521]  I told them that I overthrew Ukraine nine years ago and I will be the czar of Russia.
[01:13:35.701 --> 01:13:38.063]  But he's just, hey guys, play the clip of Biden.
[01:13:40.163 --> 01:13:42.604]  This bill would also address two other important priorities.
[01:13:43.465 --> 01:13:46.463]   First, It provides urgent funding for Ukraine.
[01:13:47.263 --> 01:13:55.350]  I'm wearing my Ukraine tie, my Ukraine pin, which I've been wearing because they're in dire straits right now defending themselves against a Russian onslaught.
[01:13:56.291 --> 01:13:57.372]  A brutal conquest.
[01:13:58.192 --> 01:13:59.193]  The clock is ticking.
[01:14:00.214 --> 01:14:02.736]  Every week, every month, it passes.
[01:14:03.356 --> 01:14:12.784]  Without new aid, Ukraine means fewer artillery shells, fewer air defense systems, fewer tools for Ukraine to defend itself against this Russian onslaught.
[01:14:13.482 --> 01:14:14.703]  Just what Putin wants.
[01:14:16.284 --> 01:14:21.409]  So they go in nine years ago with all the State Department money.
[01:14:21.589 --> 01:14:24.932]  Soros goes off Reed Zakaria on CNN and Bragg's Five Years Ago They Overthrew It.
[01:14:25.492 --> 01:14:28.655]  They start ethically cleansing the Russians that are the majority population.
[01:14:29.376 --> 01:14:32.878]  And then Putin says, I'm going to take part of the Eastern Security Zone if you don't stop.
[01:14:33.559 --> 01:14:34.460]  He goes, OK, fine.
[01:14:35.281 --> 01:14:38.683]  I'll take Crimea first to show you five years ago or six years ago.
[01:14:39.064 --> 01:14:40.285]  OK, that didn't convince you.
[01:14:40.465 --> 01:14:41.206]  Now I'm going to do this.
[01:14:42.299 --> 01:14:48.228]  And now they're saying, oh, he wants to invade all of Europe, and they're bracing for war in Poland.
[01:14:48.769 --> 01:14:49.651]  No evidence of that.
[01:14:50.191 --> 01:14:51.213]  No, absolutely not.
[01:14:53.106 --> 01:15:00.531]  When the Nord Stream Pipeline was blown up, it was because they were trying to remove the option of Russian support.
[01:15:00.731 --> 01:15:08.515]  It was, you know, they were providing natural gas to Germany and other countries, and they removed that obstacle for them.
[01:15:08.575 --> 01:15:09.516]  And then blamed the Russians.
[01:15:09.696 --> 01:15:14.639]  Yep, and then blamed the Russians, when obviously, I mean, it didn't make any sense for Russians.
[01:15:14.659 --> 01:15:15.920]  Well, Syhearst got the witnesses.
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:17.020]  They came forward.
[01:15:18.521 --> 01:15:19.262]  It was Navy divers.
[01:15:20.071 --> 01:15:20.571]  Now who is that?
[01:15:20.831 --> 01:15:21.491]  Navy divers.
[01:15:21.672 --> 01:15:22.472]  Oh, yeah, okay.
[01:15:22.512 --> 01:15:24.993]  So what we knew it was, oh, so US Navy divers.
[01:15:25.633 --> 01:15:26.213]  Interesting.
[01:15:26.313 --> 01:15:32.075]  So we knew that, I mean, there was obviously Ukrainian involvement in that.
[01:15:32.135 --> 01:15:33.855]  However, you know, I think they were sure.
[01:15:33.875 --> 01:15:34.596]  They're just puppets.
[01:15:34.616 --> 01:15:36.796]  But no, Sy Hersh got the documents.
[01:15:37.997 --> 01:15:41.678]  Special Operations is under congressional control, the Navy SEALs.
[01:15:41.718 --> 01:15:45.519]  So they went to Panama and trained regular industrial Navy divers for it.
[01:15:47.207 --> 01:15:57.671]  And you can't tell me Putin hasn't practiced great restraint during this time because he has not escalated this into a nuclear Armageddon or some giant nuclear race war.
[01:15:57.771 --> 01:16:08.174]  He has really just practiced restraint in all of this when he had every right to probably go scorched earth over there and the extent that they went to to try and, you know, defeat him.
[01:16:08.454 --> 01:16:13.016]   However, you know, Russia They were always going to win.
[01:16:13.476 --> 01:16:15.777]  It's been a money dump, is what it has been.
[01:16:15.817 --> 01:16:18.258]  The last few dollars out of the U.S.
[01:16:18.318 --> 01:16:22.300]  Treasury that they can dump into the hands of the most corrupt people in Ukraine.
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:23.981]  Ukraine is known for their corruption.
[01:16:24.281 --> 01:16:26.922]  They are known for stolen elections.
[01:16:27.362 --> 01:16:35.687]   Zelensky was installed in order to, and he was funded by Igor Kolomoisky, who also Basically made him famous.
[01:16:35.727 --> 01:16:43.964]  So he put him on a television network show, built Zelensky up as this presidential figure, and then helped get him into office.
[01:16:46.303 --> 01:16:47.404]  Sorry, excuse me.
[01:16:47.444 --> 01:16:49.145]  So it was all a setup.
[01:16:49.525 --> 01:16:53.468]  They knew years ago, I had friends going to war in Ukraine, U.S.
[01:16:53.528 --> 01:16:54.549]  military in 2018.
[01:16:54.970 --> 01:16:58.092]  So what were they planning even back then?
[01:16:58.192 --> 01:16:58.792]  Absolutely.
[01:16:58.832 --> 01:17:00.574]  That's what I was told by people I know.
[01:17:01.054 --> 01:17:02.575]  All right, I want to shift gears to the board.
[01:17:02.615 --> 01:17:03.756]  That's really got people's attention.
[01:17:04.176 --> 01:17:07.259]  They're trying to spend as much as they can, but they're not able to do it.
[01:17:07.279 --> 01:17:09.580]  We've got all the clips to prove that Biden is lying.
[01:17:10.101 --> 01:17:15.325]  I know listeners and viewers, you know he's lying, but we're going to show it for the few folks out there that may still be on the fence.
[01:17:16.443 --> 01:17:18.025]  Our guest, Loren Winsky, is here with us.
[01:17:18.065 --> 01:17:19.827]  Filmmaker, talk show host, great lady.
[01:17:21.108 --> 01:17:26.333]  And coming up, Drew Hernandez in the third hour from the Mexico-California border.
[01:17:26.654 --> 01:17:30.197]  The enemies of humanity have been very good at dividing and conquering us.
[01:17:30.578 --> 01:17:37.565]  But if we simply start thinking about things according to the definition of, is it pro-human or is it anti-human, we start to win.
[01:17:37.765 --> 01:17:39.767]  And that's why I had the idea for Team Humanity.
[01:17:39.947 --> 01:17:41.007]  I brought it up to Elon Musk.
[01:17:41.028 --> 01:17:41.768]  He loved the idea.
[01:17:42.068 --> 01:17:45.591]  What would you call the debate and discussions about a pro-human future?
[01:17:45.611 --> 01:17:46.492]  Just Team Humanity?
[01:17:46.552 --> 01:17:47.432]  Yeah, Team Humanity.
[01:17:47.592 --> 01:17:48.033]  Absolutely.
[01:17:48.353 --> 01:17:49.734]  And so we have the t-shirt.
[01:17:49.814 --> 01:17:53.217]  Team Humanity with a nuclear family standing against the globalists.
[01:17:53.497 --> 01:18:00.943]  This shirt is a great conversation starter, but it also is a fundraiser to keep InfoWars on the air so we can promote and support Team Humanity.
[01:18:01.203 --> 01:18:07.848]   I want to thank you all for your past support, but I want to encourage you all now to understand That this is a revolution against the globalists.
[01:18:07.868 --> 01:18:12.911]  That it is so critical now to signal the fact that you are part of Team Humanity.
[01:18:13.191 --> 01:18:14.512]  We're told humans are the problem.
[01:18:14.532 --> 01:18:15.533]  We're told we're killing the earth.
[01:18:15.813 --> 01:18:20.076]  We're told all this garbage so we hate ourselves and stand down and roll over and die.
[01:18:20.377 --> 01:18:21.077]  We're not going to do that.
[01:18:21.337 --> 01:18:25.981]  Get your Team Humanity shirts now at mfullworthstore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[01:18:26.957 --> 01:18:28.178]  We're in Moscow tonight.
[01:18:28.218 --> 01:18:31.181]  We're here to interview the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin.
[01:18:31.261 --> 01:18:32.362]  We'll be doing that soon.
[01:18:33.103 --> 01:18:36.406]  There are risks to conducting an interview like this, obviously.
[01:18:36.886 --> 01:18:39.209]  So we thought about it carefully over many months.
[01:18:39.689 --> 01:18:40.550]  Here's why we're doing it.
[01:18:41.431 --> 01:18:42.792]  First, because it's our job.
[01:18:43.092 --> 01:18:43.913]  We're in journalism.
[01:18:44.474 --> 01:18:46.375]  Our duty is to inform people.
[01:18:47.307 --> 01:18:52.690]  Two years into a war that's reshaping the entire world, most Americans are not informed.
[01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:58.973]  They have no real idea what's happening in this region, here in Russia or 600 miles away in Ukraine.
[01:18:59.733 --> 01:19:00.514]  But they should know.
[01:19:00.974 --> 01:19:04.876]  They're paying for much of it, in ways they might not fully yet perceive.
[01:19:05.917 --> 01:19:08.058]  The war in Ukraine is a human disaster.
[01:19:08.458 --> 01:19:16.322]  It's left hundreds of thousands of people dead, an entire generation of young Ukrainians, and has depopulated the largest country in Europe.
[01:19:17.554 --> 01:19:19.978]  But the long-term effects are even more profound.
[01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:25.287]  This war has utterly reshaped the global military and trade alliances.
[01:19:26.152 --> 01:19:28.094]  And the sanctions that followed have as well.
[01:19:28.474 --> 01:19:31.197]  And in total, they have upended the world economy.
[01:19:32.098 --> 01:19:41.887]  The post-World War II economic order, the system that guaranteed prosperity in the West for more than 80 years, is coming apart very fast, and along with it, the dominance of the U.S.
[01:19:41.927 --> 01:19:42.288]  dollar.
[01:19:43.169 --> 01:19:44.670]  These are not small changes.
[01:19:44.730 --> 01:19:46.972]  They are history-altering developments.
[01:19:47.513 --> 01:19:49.395]  They will define the lives of our grandchildren.
[01:19:50.379 --> 01:19:52.120]  Most of the world understands this perfectly well.
[01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:52.821]  They can see it.
[01:19:53.301 --> 01:19:56.584]  Ask anyone in Asia or the Middle East what the future looks like.
[01:19:57.745 --> 01:20:01.448]  And yet the populations of the English-speaking countries seem mostly unaware.
[01:20:02.088 --> 01:20:03.970]  They think that as nothing has really changed.
[01:20:04.270 --> 01:20:07.512]  And they think that because no one has told them the truth.
[01:20:08.333 --> 01:20:10.114]  Their media outlets are corrupt.
[01:20:10.375 --> 01:20:12.276]  They lie to their readers and viewers.
[01:20:12.816 --> 01:20:14.498]  And they do that mostly by omission.
[01:20:15.762 --> 01:20:26.527]  For example, since the day the war in Ukraine began, American media outlets have spoken to scores of people from Ukraine, and they've done scores of interviews with Ukrainian President Zelensky.
[01:20:27.307 --> 01:20:29.768]  We ourselves have put in a request for an interview with Zelensky.
[01:20:29.788 --> 01:20:30.669]  We hope he accepts.
[01:20:31.449 --> 01:20:34.750]  But the interviews he's already done in the United States are not traditional interviews.
[01:20:35.451 --> 01:20:40.933]  They are fawning pep sessions specifically designed to amplify Zelensky's demand that the U.S.
[01:20:41.033 --> 01:20:44.455]  enter more deeply into a war in Eastern Europe and pay for it.
[01:20:45.643 --> 01:20:46.644]  That is not journalism.
[01:20:47.144 --> 01:20:48.425]  It is government propaganda.
[01:20:49.145 --> 01:20:50.826]  Propaganda of the ugliest kind.
[01:20:50.886 --> 01:20:52.067]  The kind that kills people.
[01:20:53.108 --> 01:20:56.110]  At the same time, our politicians and media outlets have been doing this.
[01:20:57.191 --> 01:20:59.452]  Promoting a foreign leader like he's a new consumer brand.
[01:20:59.992 --> 01:21:05.376]  Not a single Western journalist has bothered to interview the president of the other country involved in this conflict.
[01:21:05.816 --> 01:21:06.577]  Vladimir Putin.
[01:21:07.717 --> 01:21:10.479]  Most Americans have no idea why Putin invaded Ukraine.
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:11.920]  Or what his goals are now.
[01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:12.941]  They've never heard his voice.
[01:21:13.882 --> 01:21:14.302]  That's wrong.
[01:21:15.529 --> 01:21:19.310]  Americans have a right to know all they can about a war they're implicated in.
[01:21:19.711 --> 01:21:22.992]  And we have the right to tell them about it because we are Americans too.
[01:21:23.652 --> 01:21:25.593]  Freedom of speech is our birthright.
[01:21:25.793 --> 01:21:28.014]  We were born with the right to say what we believe.
[01:21:28.734 --> 01:21:32.055]  That right cannot be taken away no matter who is in the White House.
[01:21:32.976 --> 01:21:33.976]  But they're trying anyway.
[01:21:34.516 --> 01:21:41.539]  Almost three years ago, the Biden administration illegally spied on our text messages and then leaked the contents to their servants in the news media.
[01:21:42.079 --> 01:21:44.600]  They did this in order to stop a Putin interview that we were planning.
[01:21:45.669 --> 01:21:48.950]  Last month, we pretty certainly did exactly the same thing once again.
[01:21:49.551 --> 01:21:51.852]  But this time, we came to Moscow anyway.
[01:21:53.112 --> 01:21:55.393]  We are not here because we love Vladimir Putin.
[01:21:55.974 --> 01:21:58.255]  We are here because we love the United States.
[01:21:58.795 --> 01:22:00.976]  And we want it to remain prosperous and free.
[01:22:02.148 --> 01:22:03.449]  We paid for this trip ourselves.
[01:22:03.469 --> 01:22:05.309]  We took no money from any government or group.
[01:22:06.030 --> 01:22:07.870]  Nor are we charging people to see the interview.
[01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:09.151]  It is not behind a paywall.
[01:22:10.011 --> 01:22:16.414]  Anyone can watch the entire thing, shot live to tape and unedited, on our website, TuckerCarlson.com.
[01:22:17.294 --> 01:22:24.777]  Elon Musk, to his great credit, has promised not to suppress or block this interview once we post it on his platform, X, and we're grateful for that.
[01:22:26.058 --> 01:22:33.984]  Western governments, by contrast, will certainly do their best to censor this video on other less principled platforms because that's what they do.
[01:22:34.265 --> 01:22:36.546]  They are afraid of information they can't control.
[01:22:37.407 --> 01:22:39.369]  But you have no reason to be afraid of it.
[01:22:40.109 --> 01:22:43.812]  We are not encouraging you to agree with what Putin may say in this interview.
[01:22:44.373 --> 01:22:46.054]  But we are urging you to watch it.
[01:22:46.514 --> 01:22:48.436]  You should know as much as you can.
[01:22:48.796 --> 01:22:53.320]  And then, like a free citizen and not a slave, you can decide for yourself.
[01:22:54.161 --> 01:22:54.401]  Thanks.
[01:22:55.856 --> 01:23:00.278]  And again, there's different debates about whether it's going to air at six central, seven central.
[01:23:00.339 --> 01:23:04.861]  We'll be here tomorrow covering it live when it happens at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:23:04.881 --> 01:23:11.925]  But what he really said that gets under their skin there is you have a right to see and listen and read what you want.
[01:23:13.223 --> 01:23:15.024]  And the old global order is coming to an end.
[01:23:15.044 --> 01:23:18.586]  We have an excellent report by Greg Reese that's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:23:19.267 --> 01:23:25.510]  The desperate, failing plan for the new American century that's the big neocon globalist operation.
[01:23:26.351 --> 01:23:29.433]  It's not going well for them, but they keep doubling down.
[01:23:29.473 --> 01:23:31.314]  Lauren Winsky, where do you see this going?
[01:23:31.714 --> 01:23:36.697]  I want to shift gears into the border because it's an example of how they start wars, they destroy borders.
[01:23:37.317 --> 01:23:41.580]  Anything they administratively have control of, they're going to weaponize and use against us, just like the courts.
[01:23:41.983 --> 01:23:45.027]  No, what you're seeing is a globalist war against nationalism.
[01:23:45.408 --> 01:23:49.113]  Now, no matter what you think about Putin, he is a Russian nationalist.
[01:23:49.213 --> 01:23:54.380]  I wish that we had an American leader who loved his country as much as Putin loves Russia.
[01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:56.062]  We did, we had Trump, he stole the election.
[01:23:56.182 --> 01:23:56.903]  Yes, exactly.
[01:23:56.903 --> 01:23:57.443]  Absolutely.
[01:23:57.463 --> 01:24:04.765]  And you know, you saw this war happen against Donald Trump and what they did to literally make sure that that man never saw office again.
[01:24:05.086 --> 01:24:16.589]   So they are well, we have the 2020 they literally concocted a pandemic in order to get mail-in ballots in order to Kind of muddied the waters of the election as they did what they wanted.
[01:24:16.949 --> 01:24:18.090]  So we saw what happened there.
[01:24:18.110 --> 01:24:23.331]  Now, against Trump, they're trying to indict him, bankrupt him, break him.
[01:24:23.651 --> 01:24:25.812]  You see that they are absolutely trying to break him.
[01:24:25.832 --> 01:24:30.333]  And the only crime he committed was loving his country and putting America first.
[01:24:30.633 --> 01:24:37.536]  And you see this globalist war on nationalists, nationalist leaders, and that's what's going on.
[01:24:37.596 --> 01:24:41.497]  They can't have that because nationalism is a threat to the global world order.
[01:24:42.714 --> 01:24:44.498]  Gut level, what do you think happens to Tucker now?
[01:24:44.518 --> 01:24:47.225]  I mean, they're going to come after him, but this just makes him bigger.
[01:24:47.926 --> 01:24:49.089]  It's so exciting to watch.
[01:24:49.370 --> 01:24:49.650]  It is.
[01:24:49.711 --> 01:24:51.655]  Well, do you remember what they did to Gonzalo Lira?
[01:24:52.677 --> 01:24:54.758]  You know, they've already killed people before.
[01:24:55.118 --> 01:24:55.898]  It's happened before.
[01:24:55.918 --> 01:24:59.319]  Talk about that, because this hit list they put them on, they're really serious about this.
[01:24:59.439 --> 01:25:00.259]  Yeah, they weren't kidding.
[01:25:00.299 --> 01:25:04.200]  So Gonzalo Lira ended up putting out a video when he first got out of jail in Ukraine.
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:06.421]  He's like, I'm going to try and make it to the border.
[01:25:06.841 --> 01:25:11.863]  Only thing he really covered, like they kind of said that he was like making Russian propaganda and all this stuff.
[01:25:11.903 --> 01:25:17.224]  No, he was actually honestly covering the war in Ukraine and what was really going on and exposing corruption going on there.
[01:25:17.444 --> 01:25:19.125]  They couldn't have that, so they threw him in prison.
[01:25:19.525 --> 01:25:23.709]  And then when he was out, they didn't let him cross, like, cross, leave the country.
[01:25:24.009 --> 01:25:27.292]  They put him back in prison, and then they eventually killed him.
[01:25:28.172 --> 01:25:35.058]  He eventually died of that, and you don't- And notice they say it's the Russians doing this with no evidence to journals around the world, but then they're doing it out in the open.
[01:25:35.378 --> 01:25:35.558]  Yes.
[01:25:35.659 --> 01:25:36.960]  And the State Department wouldn't lift a finger.
[01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:37.280]  Yep.
[01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:41.543]  Anything they can do to stop this information from getting out, from the truth.
[01:25:42.184 --> 01:25:45.944]   getting out. They will do anything. There's no extent to how far they will go.
[01:25:45.944 --> 01:25:50.824]   Do you remember during, it was during the election, I stopped the steal,
[01:25:50.824 --> 01:25:55.384]   when Tucker Carlson had a, he had done a segment on it on Fox News where he had
[01:25:55.384 --> 01:26:01.944]   received information about Hunter Biden's business partner, Bob Olinsky. And he ended up,
[01:26:01.944 --> 01:26:06.744]   one of his people in California, I believe, put it in the mail, this USB drive,
[01:26:06.744 --> 01:26:08.104]  and it never made it to Tucker.
[01:26:08.366 --> 01:26:11.708]  And they never could tell, like, what happened to it.
[01:26:11.748 --> 01:26:20.492]  They checked security cameras, everything, but they were literally stealing USB cards out of the mail in order to stop information from getting out.
[01:26:20.812 --> 01:26:25.374]  Now, who's to say they won't go into his computer systems and hack it and make sure it's deleted?
[01:26:25.695 --> 01:26:28.076]  You know, there is no... Oh, when I first broke into Bohemian Grove...
[01:26:29.827 --> 01:26:37.110]  We copied the tapes, checked the tapes, sent them to the producers in LA, and that was just a few hours south where we were at.
[01:26:37.611 --> 01:26:38.711]  They got them and they were erased.
[01:26:39.491 --> 01:26:42.193]  Then we sent them again, and they erased them again.
[01:26:42.213 --> 01:26:43.253]  Oh my gosh.
[01:26:43.914 --> 01:26:44.654]  Or they disappeared.
[01:26:45.014 --> 01:26:48.536]  Then I said, just give me one of your people's home addresses over the phone.
[01:26:48.896 --> 01:26:49.856]  I sent it there, they got it.
[01:26:49.876 --> 01:26:50.997]  But yeah, this has been going on forever.
[01:26:51.517 --> 01:26:53.979]  Yeah, and you know, it's lawlessness.
[01:26:54.199 --> 01:26:56.021]  Laws don't matter anymore in America.
[01:26:56.441 --> 01:27:02.286]  It's all about what the regime wants you to know, and there's no extent to how far they won't go in order to stop you.
[01:27:02.447 --> 01:27:04.629]  So I hope he gets it out soon.
[01:27:04.849 --> 01:27:08.712]  I hope the world sees it, and I hope Tucker Carlson nothing happens to him.
[01:27:09.032 --> 01:27:11.054]  Well, it's all because they control the Justice Department.
[01:27:11.094 --> 01:27:12.015]  They think they're above the law.
[01:27:12.355 --> 01:27:20.685]   Let's talk about the border now. Here's a clip, you're an expert on this, I
[01:27:20.685 --> 01:27:23.105]   mean I watch your show, I've seen the shows you've done, you really know what you're
[01:27:23.105 --> 01:27:28.485]   talking about, so I want to get your view on this. Here's Biden yesterday, there's a bunch of
[01:27:28.485 --> 01:27:35.565]   clips of this, he talked for like an hour, saying that Trump's the reason the border's broken, but I
[01:27:35.565 --> 01:27:40.115]   have the graphs of what happened to the border when Trump was in, so it's a ball-faced lie.
[01:27:40.115 --> 01:27:47.576]   It's too long as you all know, the immigration system has been broken, and it's long past
[01:27:47.576 --> 01:27:48.605]  time to fix it.
[01:27:48.844 --> 01:27:57.133]  That's why months ago, I instructed my team to begin negotiations with a bipartisan group of senators to seriously and finally fix our immigration system.
[01:27:57.953 --> 01:27:59.615]  For months now, that's what they've done.
[01:28:00.516 --> 01:28:07.844]  Working around the clock, through the holidays, over the weekends, it's been an extraordinary effort by Senators Lankford, Murphy, and Sinema.
[01:28:08.703 --> 01:28:18.485]  The result of all this hard work is a bipartisan agreement that represents the most fair, humane reforms in our immigration system in a long time.
[01:28:19.206 --> 01:28:22.026]  And the toughest set of reforms to secure the border ever.
[01:28:23.087 --> 01:28:27.808]  Now, all indications are this bill won't even move forward to the Senate floor.
[01:28:28.548 --> 01:28:28.868]  Why?
[01:28:28.888 --> 01:28:30.549]  A simple reason.
[01:28:31.569 --> 01:28:32.169]  Donald Trump.
[01:28:33.353 --> 01:28:35.935]  Because Donald Trump thinks it's bad for him politically.
[01:28:36.075 --> 01:28:40.039]  Therefore, he doesn't, even though it helps the country, he's not for it.
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:43.402]  He'd rather weaponize this issue than actually solve it.
[01:28:44.283 --> 01:28:54.873]  So for the last 24 hours, he's done nothing I'm told, but reach out to Republicans in the House and the Senate and threaten them and try to intimidate them to vote against this proposal.
[01:28:55.753 --> 01:28:57.315]  And it looks like they're caving.
[01:28:58.279 --> 01:29:02.880]   Frankly, they owe it to the American people to show some spine and do what they know to
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:03.880]  be right.
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:09.439]   Warren, this is some of the most incredible gaslighting in a world full of gaslighting.
[01:29:09.439 --> 01:29:10.439]  That says a lot.
[01:29:10.439 --> 01:29:15.359]   I mean, it's hard to unpack all the lies, but I can play three or four clips of him
[01:29:15.359 --> 01:29:19.079]  saying when I win the election, surge the border.
[01:29:19.079 --> 01:29:23.998]   Him turning off the federal laws that were already there to stop the human trafficking,
[01:29:23.998 --> 01:29:25.199]  to stop all this happening.
[01:29:25.199 --> 01:29:27.199]  No, he said, come here.
[01:29:27.199 --> 01:29:30.000]  So that's why we see this record surge before Trump got in.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.358]  Obama had launched the same operation.
[01:29:32.358 --> 01:29:33.800]  It took Trump about a year.
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:37.599]  We'll show the graph, but he cut it down to almost nothing.
[01:29:37.599 --> 01:29:42.599]  And so we know the history of what happened here.
[01:29:42.599 --> 01:29:47.239]   But Biden again, until just two months ago, they said the border is not broken.
[01:29:47.239 --> 01:29:51.519]   Remember when they figured out their constituents had finally woke up, what's happening?
[01:29:51.519 --> 01:29:53.119]  They said, yeah, it's broken.
[01:29:53.119 --> 01:29:54.399]  We need to legalize everybody.
[01:29:54.399 --> 01:29:55.399]  That'll fix it.
[01:29:55.399 --> 01:29:58.719]  So let me show folks a graph here.
[01:29:58.719 --> 01:30:01.958]  Biden claims only reason border not secure is Donald Trump.
[01:30:01.958 --> 01:30:02.239]  OK.
[01:30:02.239 --> 01:30:03.078]  Bye.
[01:30:03.902 --> 01:30:04.522]  Well, here it is.
[01:30:05.362 --> 01:30:08.183]  Southwest border apprehensions from the Border Patrol.
[01:30:08.883 --> 01:30:14.885]  Trump gets into office, it's already surging up, because right before Obama left, he said, you know, bring kids, the border's open.
[01:30:16.565 --> 01:30:19.406]  Then, Trump was able to get legislation finally through.
[01:30:20.586 --> 01:30:24.307]  Tariff threat leads to Mexican cooperation on Remain in Mexico.
[01:30:25.168 --> 01:30:35.475]   So, it goes straight up, and then straight down, Until Title 42 is implemented, and then it goes down to almost nothing.
[01:30:36.375 --> 01:30:59.444]   So again, Obama weaponizes it, opens it, starts what Biden's continuing, Trump inherits a problem, boom, brings it down to here, gets Title 42 in, brings it down to almost zero, but then he gets in, He sells the election, January 2021, opens it completely,
[01:30:59.444 --> 01:31:00.663]  and now look where we are.
[01:31:00.663 --> 01:31:01.465]  Oh wow.
[01:31:01.465 --> 01:31:06.104]  Now, now, that is the truth, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:06.104 --> 01:31:07.543]  Lauren Witzke, your take on that.
[01:31:07.543 --> 01:31:12.743]   Yeah, I mean, I remember during COVID, Trump called for a complete immigration moratorium.
[01:31:12.943 --> 01:31:14.805]  And I remember that, hey, guess what?
[01:31:14.945 --> 01:31:16.086]  Immigrants stop coming here.
[01:31:16.286 --> 01:31:17.867]  Now Biden gets into office.
[01:31:17.927 --> 01:31:24.212]  He undoes, I think he does 52 executive orders undoing everything that the Trump presidency did.
[01:31:24.853 --> 01:31:26.014]  And it was intentional.
[01:31:26.334 --> 01:31:27.014]  It's intentional.
[01:31:27.054 --> 01:31:28.815]  They want people to flood our border.
[01:31:28.835 --> 01:31:32.857]  They want our nation to be in disarray and to be destabilized.
[01:31:33.217 --> 01:31:40.741]  I don't even believe they put any money in the border bill in order to address the opioid or the fentanyl epidemic that's happening in our country.
[01:31:41.682 --> 01:31:45.183]  100,000 Americans dead last year due to fentanyl overdoses.
[01:31:45.343 --> 01:31:48.865]  I, this year, have lost two friends to the opioid epidemic.
[01:31:48.945 --> 01:31:50.506]  And it's getting worse and worse.
[01:31:50.586 --> 01:31:52.467]  And how does that fentanyl get here?
[01:31:52.887 --> 01:32:04.935]  Well, it comes from China, it goes to Mexico, and across our southern border, they're walking it right across, they're taking it to the inner cities, and then they're selling it to American kids and killing them with no regard for human life whatsoever.
[01:32:04.975 --> 01:32:05.916]  These people aren't human.
[01:32:06.637 --> 01:32:09.879]  So that is who Joe Biden is welcoming into our country.
[01:32:10.299 --> 01:32:14.402]  And that is what actually this border bill ends up facilitating more of.
[01:32:14.682 --> 01:32:26.474]   What was it, like 5,000 migrants can come in a day, and the money was to Yeah, it's an amnesty bill.
[01:32:26.774 --> 01:32:30.719]  And he can also declare an emergency or, quote, undeclare one and do whatever he wants.
[01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:32.861]  What do you make of Mayorkas?
[01:32:33.682 --> 01:32:36.606]  House fails to impeach Mayorkas after four Republicans joined Democrats.
[01:32:36.826 --> 01:32:37.927]  No, I think that's disgusting.
[01:32:38.007 --> 01:32:42.130]  So reportedly one of the Congress people said, oh, I just voted no.
[01:32:42.610 --> 01:32:49.034]  I want Mayorkas impeached, but I voted no because he was waiting for Steve Scalise to come back so he could vote.
[01:32:49.394 --> 01:32:51.896]  I don't know if that's necessarily true or if that's a giant cope.
[01:32:51.976 --> 01:32:56.099]  However, I hope this isn't over because what I saw yesterday, there was no excuse.
[01:32:56.139 --> 01:33:00.802]  Mayorkas, this is an intentional invasion is what is happening.
[01:33:01.181 --> 01:33:05.541]   People don't know that Mayorkas used to work, he was the board member for HIAS,
[01:33:05.541 --> 01:33:12.661]   the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, who facilitated, and to this day are still facilitating
[01:33:12.661 --> 01:33:16.541]  illegal aliens, putting them, placing them into red states.
[01:33:16.541 --> 01:33:19.261]  My friend in Idaho posted footage.
[01:33:19.261 --> 01:33:22.581]   They are dumping them in deep red states, and it's strategic.
[01:33:22.581 --> 01:33:29.942]   It's in voting places that have a tendency to vote more red, and that is who Mayorkas used to work with.
[01:33:29.942 --> 01:33:34.300]   That is who he used to manage, and you're gonna tell me that he, all of a sudden,
[01:33:34.300 --> 01:33:35.141]  had a change of heart.
[01:33:35.141 --> 01:33:40.341]   Now, Mayorkas is the greatest human trafficker in modern history.
[01:33:40.341 --> 01:33:42.940]  He is the pedophile in chief.
[01:33:43.822 --> 01:33:50.125]  90 plus thousand children, it was 80-something, the number's above 9 now, since Biden took over, that they handed over that they're missing.
[01:33:50.425 --> 01:33:50.606]  Yes.
[01:33:50.826 --> 01:33:51.126]  Of 500,000.
[01:33:51.566 --> 01:33:53.907]  So Mayorkas is a pedophile.
[01:33:54.207 --> 01:33:59.630]  Whether he's raping kids or not, he is facilitating the mass sexual abuse of children.
[01:33:59.750 --> 01:34:01.791]  Yep, and they are recycling these children too.
[01:34:02.171 --> 01:34:03.712]  It's not just they get into the container.
[01:34:03.752 --> 01:34:05.793]  Oh yeah, there's a new video out where they bring them over and over again.
[01:34:05.953 --> 01:34:10.156]  Yep, these little children, there are horror stories of what is happening to these little children.
[01:34:10.456 --> 01:34:13.338]  And it's our fault because we are allowing it to happen.
[01:34:13.658 --> 01:34:20.843]  A strong border wall stops these people from taking these kids, these coyotes, from taking these kids, using them as a means to come into our country.
[01:34:21.203 --> 01:34:24.085]  And sometimes being tough is what's best for them.
[01:34:24.225 --> 01:34:26.207]  We have got to put a stop to the human trafficking.
[01:34:26.227 --> 01:34:27.868]  We've got to put a stop to the drug trafficking.
[01:34:28.148 --> 01:34:34.393]   And we can't do that when we have somebody like Mayorkas, who is an intentionally I don't care if they're black, white, or brown.
[01:34:34.433 --> 01:34:37.716]  There's homeless people everywhere of every color, crime everywhere, stuff not working, things breaking, prices exploding.
[01:34:37.536 --> 01:34:41.256]   our country and they want these criminals and villains here and if you've
[01:34:41.256 --> 01:34:45.096]   looked around lately our country is drastically changing the culture is
[01:34:45.096 --> 01:34:48.975]   changing. I don't care if they're black, white or brown there's homeless people
[01:34:48.975 --> 01:34:52.935]   everywhere of every color, crime everywhere, stuff not working, things
[01:34:52.935 --> 01:34:57.734]   breaking, you know prices exploding. I mean we're being royally screwed.
[01:34:57.734 --> 01:35:02.414]  Here is a clip 10.
[01:35:00.495 --> 01:35:08.682]  This is a clip of Biden and Gavin Newsom before they shifted to this whole claim that Trump broke the border.
[01:35:08.882 --> 01:35:09.282]  Here they are.
[01:35:10.543 --> 01:35:12.424]  So let's just state the facts.
[01:35:12.945 --> 01:35:18.609]  We are currently experiencing the lowest number of border crossings since 1971.
[01:35:21.771 --> 01:35:28.196]  In California, like our nation, our undocumented population is at the lowest level in more than a decade.
[01:35:28.993 --> 01:35:33.035]  Mr. Vice President, under the Trump administration, asylum has virtually ended.
[01:35:33.675 --> 01:35:35.696]  ICE detention centers are practically empty.
[01:35:37.157 --> 01:35:41.059]  Your new plan calls for reversing President Trump's harsh plan.
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:44.821]  But won't that restart a brand new border crisis?
[01:35:44.961 --> 01:35:50.564]  I mean, what would you do with all those people in camps now waiting in Mexico?
[01:35:52.085 --> 01:35:54.086]  It will if we don't do it well.
[01:35:54.106 --> 01:36:04.134]   If we don't reach out To the communities that are willing to, the charitable communities that will come in and help.
[01:36:04.434 --> 01:36:17.137]  And in addition to us spending millions of dollars providing for access, access for judges, access for asylum folks to be on the border, to move quickly.
[01:36:18.718 --> 01:36:20.958]  So it's another clip of him basically saying search the border.
[01:36:21.018 --> 01:36:23.919]  So we need more illegal aliens.
[01:36:24.932 --> 01:36:25.792]  Trump's stopping it.
[01:36:25.852 --> 01:36:27.433]  Years later, Trump opened the border.
[01:36:28.614 --> 01:36:30.155]  No, no, it's Trump's fault.
[01:36:30.215 --> 01:36:31.976]  This is all Trump's fault.
[01:36:32.196 --> 01:36:37.338]  But, you know, that was the only excuse they have because Democrats actually have the executive branch.
[01:36:37.418 --> 01:36:41.300]  They're actually the ones in charge, and this invasion is on them.
[01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:43.281]  It wasn't in existence.
[01:36:43.341 --> 01:36:44.482]  The graph doesn't lie.
[01:36:44.822 --> 01:36:54.167]  He inherits Obama, accelerating an attack, takes him a year or so to start cutting it down, cuts it down 60, 70 percent, and then cuts it down 90 plus percent.
[01:36:54.907 --> 01:36:55.187]  Boom.
[01:36:55.287 --> 01:36:56.368]  And then Biden gets in.
[01:36:56.948 --> 01:36:57.588]  Numbers don't lie.
[01:36:57.608 --> 01:36:57.928]  Look at that.
[01:36:58.048 --> 01:36:59.309]  No, it absolutely does not lie.
[01:36:59.489 --> 01:37:05.131]  And, you know, there was also in the beginning those caravans that they kept funding to come into our country.
[01:37:05.151 --> 01:37:08.372]  You know, I have no doubt that somebody is paying for these caravans.
[01:37:08.412 --> 01:37:15.174]  These people don't just drop everything and move across, you know, travel across the country to come to America without funding.
[01:37:15.254 --> 01:37:16.135]  Well, they've got the U.N.
[01:37:16.155 --> 01:37:16.855]  camps and all of it.
[01:37:16.895 --> 01:37:19.236]  You know what this graph reminds me of right here?
[01:37:19.256 --> 01:37:33.121]   Right when Biden steals the election and gets into power, The number of illegal aliens explodes, just like all the graphs of they start the COVID shots, and the heart attacks, the blood clots, the strokes, the cancer, all does the same thing on the graph.
[01:37:33.561 --> 01:37:35.602]  You're a conspiracy theorist, you know that, right?
[01:37:35.823 --> 01:37:36.003]  Yeah.
[01:37:36.283 --> 01:37:42.668]  I can just look at that and say, look, Biden gets in, and then it goes exactly, oh, just instead of debating that, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[01:37:42.708 --> 01:37:45.069]  Yeah, they're trying to convince you that what you're seeing is not real.
[01:37:45.270 --> 01:37:49.112]  That is like the ultimate form of gaslighting, and they are very, very good at that.
[01:37:49.513 --> 01:37:50.553]  But, you know, it's...
[01:37:51.601 --> 01:38:02.232]  The fact that they come into our country and they know that they'll get a plane ticket, a four-star hotel, a meal, a cell phone, new clothes, why wouldn't they come?
[01:38:02.693 --> 01:38:07.357]  We have got to cut off the benefits that these immigrants are receiving and they'd stop coming.
[01:38:08.058 --> 01:38:10.740]  That's pretty obvious, and I know the Biden administration knows that.
[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:13.102]  However, they don't want them not to come.
[01:38:13.222 --> 01:38:13.962]  They want them here.
[01:38:14.042 --> 01:38:18.826]  They want them here just in time to destabilize the population before the election.
[01:38:19.106 --> 01:38:21.027]  And I think it's going to end up being a terrorist attack.
[01:38:21.067 --> 01:38:22.348]  I think they're planning a terrorist attack.
[01:38:22.368 --> 01:38:28.132]  They're letting these Middle Eastern migrants, these migrants come in across our country, our southern border, who are...
[01:38:29.013 --> 01:38:32.897]  There was a video of one of the migrants saying, they were like, what's your name?
[01:38:32.957 --> 01:38:33.397]  Who are you?
[01:38:33.457 --> 01:38:36.600]  And he said, yep, he said, you'll find out soon.
[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:37.781]  That was a threat, folks.
[01:38:37.821 --> 01:38:38.461]  That was the threat.
[01:38:38.842 --> 01:38:42.745]  And I think that, you know, what happens when there is a terrorist attack in America?
[01:38:43.206 --> 01:38:43.566]  Well, the.
[01:38:44.727 --> 01:38:46.669]  The Department of Homeland Security is in charge.
[01:38:46.749 --> 01:39:02.020]  Did you know that the Department of Homeland Security, I'm sure you've probably covered this, Operation Blackout, they performed a war drill planning for a terrorist attack during the elections so that the Department of Homeland Security could come in and take over the elections, oversee them, etc, etc.
[01:39:02.881 --> 01:39:07.583]  Now, like we said before, they will do anything to stop President Trump from winning.
[01:39:08.083 --> 01:39:17.467]  Who's to say that they aren't intentionally welcoming terrorists into our country so they can cause some kind of attack or false flag event?
[01:39:17.567 --> 01:39:18.728]  Oh, I don't think that's debatable.
[01:39:18.788 --> 01:39:19.668]  I think that's a fact.
[01:39:19.748 --> 01:39:22.749]  And they're trying to brand Trump supporters as terrorists.
[01:39:22.769 --> 01:39:24.050]  They're saying Trump's going to be a dictator.
[01:39:24.410 --> 01:39:26.611]  They're planning a bunch of big stuff in the next nine months.
[01:39:26.671 --> 01:39:29.152]  I mean, we are in such an insane moment of time right now.
[01:39:29.392 --> 01:39:29.932]  No, it's true.
[01:39:30.073 --> 01:39:34.896]  You know, just like Event 201, it was the war drill before COVID, down to a tee.
[01:39:35.256 --> 01:39:39.159]  They did the same thing with Operation Blackout and the Department of Homeland Security.
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:42.862]  They pre-planned what they're going to do before they execute it.
[01:39:42.962 --> 01:39:51.749]  So why on earth would you run a war drill about a terrorist attack in America over the elections, unless you're learning how to execute it?
[01:39:52.389 --> 01:39:54.110]  Operation Blackout, I mentioned a few times.
[01:39:54.130 --> 01:39:57.093]  I'm glad you remind me of that because that's critical information.
[01:39:57.113 --> 01:40:00.356]  It's kind of like Operation Lockstep or Event 201 predicting COVID.
[01:40:00.496 --> 01:40:01.076]  Yep, it's true.
[01:40:01.196 --> 01:40:02.697]  And you know what their solution was?
[01:40:02.938 --> 01:40:14.967]  They said, in order for us to prevent a terrorist attack over the election, we have got to pre-select and pre-place Department of Homeland Security over the elections proactively in order to protect the elections.
[01:40:14.987 --> 01:40:16.789]  That's right, they'll protect the election by running it.
[01:40:16.929 --> 01:40:17.069]  Yep.
[01:40:17.229 --> 01:40:19.552]  And that's their answer to make sure the feds can fully steal it.
[01:40:19.812 --> 01:40:21.795]  Do you see all the new documents coming out with the state police in Michigan?
[01:40:22.075 --> 01:40:24.518]  Where they found the safe houses with the fake ballots and everything?
[01:40:25.219 --> 01:40:26.700]  Uh, no, I did not.
[01:40:27.201 --> 01:40:27.481]  Barely.
[01:40:27.682 --> 01:40:28.743]  Gateway Pundit covered it.
[01:40:28.783 --> 01:40:29.263]  We covered it.
[01:40:29.283 --> 01:40:31.105]  You need to get all... OAN did.
[01:40:32.667 --> 01:40:32.968]  In fact...
[01:40:34.121 --> 01:40:36.181]  The first five minutes of the next hour, she leaves us.
[01:40:36.601 --> 01:40:39.922]  Head of Drew Hernandez joining us from the Mexico-California border.
[01:40:40.442 --> 01:40:42.963]  Get that, it's like I said, OAN, like two and a half minute clip.
[01:40:42.983 --> 01:40:43.963]  It only covers part of it.
[01:40:44.863 --> 01:40:45.643]  I played it Sunday.
[01:40:46.183 --> 01:40:53.324]  But man, it is just, it is the, I posted it on Twitter, or on X, it's called the smoking gun of 2020 election.
[01:40:53.704 --> 01:40:54.745]  But it's just crazy, yeah.
[01:40:55.905 --> 01:41:02.226]  You know those vans you saw in the different counties, people followed them back to the safe houses with them filling out all the fake stuff.
[01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:04.030]  No, no, no.
[01:41:04.150 --> 01:41:06.131]  Then they gave it to the FBI and nothing was done.
[01:41:06.351 --> 01:41:06.591]  Right.
[01:41:06.831 --> 01:41:11.052]  Well, of course nothing was done because, I mean, we're not in charge anymore.
[01:41:11.072 --> 01:41:15.494]  They put their people into positions of power where it matters because they had this all pre-planned out.
[01:41:15.854 --> 01:41:19.515]  And, you know, if the media tries to get any of this out, they shut them down.
[01:41:19.575 --> 01:41:20.475]  They stifle you.
[01:41:20.595 --> 01:41:20.976]  Absolutely.
[01:41:20.996 --> 01:41:21.576]  They hide you.
[01:41:21.636 --> 01:41:25.077]  So it's not surprising that... Well, Lauren Wetzke, I'm excited you're here in town.
[01:41:25.097 --> 01:41:25.857]  You're a filmmaker.
[01:41:25.897 --> 01:41:27.918]  Hopefully we're going to film together or something down the road.
[01:41:27.938 --> 01:41:28.518]  Yeah, let's do it.
[01:41:28.558 --> 01:41:28.898]  Let's go.
[01:41:28.918 --> 01:41:30.959]  And you've got a lot of other stuff going on.
[01:41:31.099 --> 01:41:31.839]  Yes, yes, we do.
[01:41:32.199 --> 01:41:37.584]  Alright, well I was supposed to have you on yesterday, I was supposed to meet with you about that, then I had to run off, but I'll talk to you after the show too.
[01:41:37.985 --> 01:41:39.446]  I appreciate you staying, it's great to have you here.
[01:41:39.466 --> 01:41:40.667]  Thank you so much for having me.
[01:41:40.928 --> 01:41:42.149]  Where do people find all your great work?
[01:41:42.409 --> 01:41:46.834]  Oh, you can follow me on Twitter at LaurenWitzkiDE.
[01:41:46.854 --> 01:41:48.896]  I'm also on Telegram and Gab of course.
[01:41:48.976 --> 01:41:53.981]  So just go ahead and give me a follow and I will keep you posted on all of our upcoming work.
[01:41:54.421 --> 01:41:55.562]  Lauren Whiskey, DE.
[01:41:55.602 --> 01:41:56.502]  What's the DE stand for?
[01:41:56.582 --> 01:41:56.983]  Delaware.
[01:41:57.003 --> 01:41:57.723]  I'm from Delaware.
[01:41:57.983 --> 01:41:58.724]  That's right.
[01:41:58.864 --> 01:41:59.844]  Originally from Delaware.
[01:41:59.865 --> 01:42:04.227]  I'm a Florida refugee from Delaware because Joe Biden chased me and my family out.
[01:42:05.348 --> 01:42:06.369]  That's a whole other story, isn't it?
[01:42:06.429 --> 01:42:07.809]  Yeah, that is a whole other story.
[01:42:08.110 --> 01:42:11.152]  They removed my brother from the Delaware bar.
[01:42:11.632 --> 01:42:12.973]  They're still coming after him.
[01:42:13.113 --> 01:42:16.595]  They never forgave me for challenging the status quo.
[01:42:16.615 --> 01:42:16.915]  That's right.
[01:42:16.955 --> 01:42:17.536]  You ran for...
[01:42:18.496 --> 01:42:18.796]  Senate.
[01:42:19.076 --> 01:42:19.496]  Yes, I did.
[01:42:19.816 --> 01:42:20.196]  Yes, I did.
[01:42:20.216 --> 01:42:21.217]  I remember having you on when you did it.
[01:42:21.497 --> 01:42:22.717]  Yep, yep, yep.
[01:42:22.957 --> 01:42:23.677]  I had a great time.
[01:42:24.377 --> 01:42:26.458]  InfoWars was a great supporter of my U.S.
[01:42:26.478 --> 01:42:32.459]  Senate campaign, ran on an immigration moratorium, and broke the Delaware record in most GOP U.S.
[01:42:32.479 --> 01:42:34.720]  Senate candidate votes in Delaware history.
[01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:37.720]  So there's something more to the immigration crisis.
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:38.681]  Everybody cares about it.
[01:42:39.041 --> 01:42:39.661]  Great job.
[01:42:39.701 --> 01:42:40.381]  Thank you so much.
[01:42:40.841 --> 01:42:41.441]  Talk to you soon.
[01:42:41.461 --> 01:42:42.841]  We'll be right back with our number three.
[01:42:42.861 --> 01:42:45.062]  Bennett Bothelms died.
[01:42:47.838 --> 01:42:52.101]  You can see here the Great Awakening orbiting the Great Reset.
[01:42:52.802 --> 01:43:02.549]  Although the depopulation systems of the Great Reset are not yet fully operational, the Great Reset does have a strong conspiracy network.
[01:43:03.009 --> 01:43:08.914]  It is protected by a satanic shield, which can be disabled by the Great Awakening.
[01:43:09.294 --> 01:43:15.499]  The Great Reset must be deactivated if any victory for humanity is to be accomplished.
[01:43:16.548 --> 01:43:30.580]  Once the Great Awakening deactivates the shield, InfoWars.com forward slash show will cover the truth while Info Warriors fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the Great Reset.
[01:43:31.081 --> 01:43:34.824]  Alex Jones has volunteered to lead the fighter attack.
[01:43:35.164 --> 01:43:40.589]  Get a signed copy of the Great Awakening today at InfoWarsStore.com!
[01:43:43.496 --> 01:43:43.996]  History.
[01:43:44.636 --> 01:43:54.098]  Apparently, their definition of transparency is that if you ask any questions about the election, then you'd be taken to court for billions of dollars and slapped with federal indictments.
[01:43:54.918 --> 01:43:57.578]  Other than that, yeah, totally transparent.
[01:43:58.759 --> 01:44:12.561]  It's this kind of transparency that led us to the discovery that back in October of 2020, just before the elections, mind you, some 8 to 10,000 suspected fraudulent voter registrations were dumped at a small city in western Michigan.
[01:44:13.371 --> 01:44:24.996]  Far left State Attorney General Dana Nessel, the same one who last year called for drag queens at every elementary school, has confirmed this case is so serious it was actually referred to the FBI.
[01:44:25.436 --> 01:44:30.118]  Now we know that's where it will stop, but the fact that it made it that far is interesting.
[01:44:31.331 --> 01:44:40.335]  So what apparently happened is that a Muskegon City clerk discovered a black one dropping off thousands of these completed voter registration forms.
[01:44:40.955 --> 01:44:58.224]   According to reports from the Gateway Pundit and the Detroit News, these applications all had the exact same handwriting, used addresses that didn't exist, The clerk reported the woman and an investigation later
[01:44:58.224 --> 01:45:02.224]   found she worked for a group called GBI Strategies.
[01:45:02.224 --> 01:45:07.304]   This firm was funded by a dark money super PAC, ironically called BlackPAC,
[01:45:07.304 --> 01:45:12.382]   which paid GBI over $11 million to register voters for Joe Biden.
[01:45:12.382 --> 01:45:18.703]   It gets weirder though, because this group, GBI Strategies, was operating at an old eyeglass store.
[01:45:18.703 --> 01:45:23.264]   And when the police showed up, what they found was like something out of a movie.
[01:45:23.264 --> 01:45:27.623]   In this old store where the Democrats were apparently filling out phony voter
[01:45:27.623 --> 01:45:28.423]  registrations.
[01:45:28.682 --> 01:45:35.663]  The police discovered prepaid cash cards, rental cars, burner phones, and cases full of guns.
[01:45:36.464 --> 01:45:37.664]  These weren't just regular guns.
[01:45:37.704 --> 01:45:46.946]  The police report shows they uncovered both semi and fully automatic rifles, at least four customized pistols, as well as silencers for the weapons.
[01:45:48.137 --> 01:45:59.409]  Responding to this, the Attorney General's Office, probably for the first time in history, defended the find by claiming that all these terrifying weapons of war were registered and known legally.
[01:45:59.429 --> 01:46:03.413]  I mean, who doesn't take automatic rifles to work with them at the office?
[01:46:03.854 --> 01:46:04.594]  And silencers?
[01:46:05.015 --> 01:46:06.336]  Come on, guns are loud!
[01:46:06.576 --> 01:46:07.597]  They need to be quieter!
[01:46:07.617 --> 01:46:08.779]  That's perfectly normal.
[01:46:08.799 --> 01:46:09.920]  Don't be so paranoid.
[01:46:12.363 --> 01:46:23.194]  There were also apparently several whiteboards in the room with notes, and on one of them was written, Hot Topics, which listed weapons in the field prepared for shifts.
[01:46:25.116 --> 01:46:27.239]  None of this is ominous at all.
[01:46:28.706 --> 01:46:33.550]  During their investigation, police also discovered temporary businesses where the registrations were being stored.
[01:46:33.971 --> 01:46:44.140]  And it turns out, the Democrat firm wasn't just filling out fake voter registrations, they were actually shipping entire packages of these registrations off to other communities.
[01:46:47.381 --> 01:46:54.132]  Michael Anderson said it's totally unexpected to find weapons and silencers in a normal business.
[01:46:54.833 --> 01:47:00.301]  And that it's a lot easier to hide information when you use prepaid cash cards to pay employees.
[01:47:01.354 --> 01:47:09.336]  Authorities are still investigating, but this appears to be nothing less than industrialized voter fraud, organized and sanctioned by the Democrat Party.
[01:47:10.116 --> 01:47:22.899]  Astonishingly, or perhaps not, the director of GBI Strategies, Gary Bell, actually brags about operating similar organizations in at least 20 states, including all of the key battleground states.
[01:47:24.127 --> 01:47:26.249]  So we know this isn't an isolated event.
[01:47:26.369 --> 01:47:31.214]  The Democrats are manufacturing voting fraud on a national scale.
[01:47:32.195 --> 01:47:37.380]  Now this investigation has been covered up and buried by politicians and the mainstream media for obvious reasons.
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:43.406]  And after being turned over to the FBI, run by Christopher Wray, it was apparently left to die.
[01:47:48.322 --> 01:47:50.304]  That's well over the roughly 150,000 votes Joe Biden was awarded.
[01:47:50.123 --> 01:47:57.283]   as many as 800,000 ballot applications were sent to non-qualified voters in Michigan.
[01:47:57.283 --> 01:48:02.923]   That's well over the roughly 150,000 votes Joe Biden was awarded.
[01:48:02.923 --> 01:48:09.962]   More than enough to overturn the election and give President Trump a victory in Michigan.
[01:48:09.962 --> 01:48:13.884]  For One America News, I'm Jason Sharpe.
[01:48:13.884 --> 01:48:22.724]   If you are receiving this transmission, you are free of justice.
[01:48:22.724 --> 01:48:24.724]  It's Amos Jones.
[01:48:24.724 --> 01:48:31.443]   Look, I'm going to be just completely frank with the listeners.
[01:48:32.216 --> 01:48:44.865]   I say a lot of things about myself here on air that are bad and I do it because honesty is the best policy and admitting our faults is Really what it's all about.
[01:48:44.905 --> 01:48:48.947]  And you're going to hear me say this, and you're going to say, well, that's not that bad a thing, or that's not bad.
[01:48:48.967 --> 01:48:50.128]  Yeah, it is.
[01:48:51.448 --> 01:48:51.889]  Yeah, it is.
[01:48:52.189 --> 01:49:08.016]  So, during the break, while I was eating a quick bite of lunch and talking to my middle daughter, got three great daughters, great son, I was walking back to the studio and I just thought about, what am I supposed to say right now?
[01:49:08.036 --> 01:49:13.559]  You know, I've got all this news, all this information in front of me.
[01:49:14.824 --> 01:49:16.005]  But I'm not just here to cover news.
[01:49:16.045 --> 01:49:17.546]  I'm here to really talk about the heart of the matter.
[01:49:18.927 --> 01:49:20.249]  And I thought, well, just look in the mirror.
[01:49:22.651 --> 01:49:25.933]  And, you know, a thought is hard to quantify.
[01:49:25.993 --> 01:49:27.695]  I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.
[01:49:28.772 --> 01:49:33.416]  A thought is so complex, so deep, connected to so many things, and you're like, how do you say this?
[01:49:33.616 --> 01:49:38.900]  And so I was sitting here as the music started with Jimi Hendrix singing, thinking, how do I explain this?
[01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:41.041]  And I thought, well, maybe you shouldn't even say it.
[01:49:40.860 --> 01:49:48.860]   it. I'm like no. It's huge but it's simple at the same time but also super deep like anything complex.
[01:49:48.860 --> 01:49:55.980]  Here's the best way to say it.
[01:49:56.193 --> 01:49:57.334]  We've already been conquered.
[01:49:58.493 --> 01:49:59.974]  Let's stop lying to ourselves.
[01:50:00.174 --> 01:50:01.195]  We're not in a war.
[01:50:01.255 --> 01:50:02.015]  We lost the war.
[01:50:03.756 --> 01:50:09.600]  But if you're occupied by an enemy power, the first thing you got to do is admit you're occupied.
[01:50:10.100 --> 01:50:12.782]  So I don't say that to demoralize you or make you depressed.
[01:50:13.482 --> 01:50:19.706]  I say it because let's just admit we've been trained to put up with outrageous garbage.
[01:50:19.726 --> 01:50:21.647]  I have another word for it.
[01:50:21.667 --> 01:50:24.669]  I'm not going to say it on the radio or TV.
[01:50:26.030 --> 01:50:30.677]   So, I'm trying to explain this.
[01:50:31.117 --> 01:50:33.738]  It's... You know what I'm talking about.
[01:50:34.198 --> 01:50:37.578]  It's a sense of guilt that we've let it go this far.
[01:50:38.559 --> 01:50:47.200]  And that it's kind of sick if I just sit here and like chronicle this like I'm doing a voiceover to a snuff film.
[01:50:49.060 --> 01:50:54.041]  I'm not doing this to just sit here and fear porn cover the latest newer developments.
[01:50:54.241 --> 01:50:55.301]  I really want to stop this.
[01:50:57.762 --> 01:51:15.360]   And to do that We have to admit that we've literally been under bio-attack, and I don't like to be like a liberal, oh, we're victims, but every man, woman and child in the world, but particularly the West, are veterans of a bio-weapon attack through the virus and then through the shot.
[01:51:17.362 --> 01:51:19.864]  And we have to really take that seriously is what I'm saying.
[01:51:20.304 --> 01:51:23.327]  And a lot of you are like, well, Jones, you take it pretty serious, man.
[01:51:24.047 --> 01:51:24.608]  No, I don't.
[01:51:25.749 --> 01:51:25.869]  No.
[01:51:29.701 --> 01:51:31.002]  I mean, that's what happened in the first hour.
[01:51:32.003 --> 01:51:36.908]  I was so upset about all this that I couldn't even make myself cover it.
[01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:45.296]  And so I played the SWAT team clip of the women's SWAT team members that couldn't find their ass with both hands.
[01:51:45.916 --> 01:51:53.844]  And see, I could do a really entertaining show like that and be somewhat conservative, but it's not going to beat the new world order to just play fun clips.
[01:51:55.103 --> 01:51:56.383]  And show how stupid the left is.
[01:51:56.823 --> 01:52:00.304]  The left are people that fell to the enemy brainwashing and programming.
[01:52:00.484 --> 01:52:01.925]  They're people we lost!
[01:52:03.225 --> 01:52:06.706]  And I'm as guilty as anybody or worse at making fun of the left.
[01:52:06.926 --> 01:52:10.167]  They're nasty, they're stupid, they're ignorant, they're arrogant.
[01:52:11.147 --> 01:52:12.087]  I can't stand them!
[01:52:14.027 --> 01:52:17.688]  But... They're people we lost, folks.
[01:52:18.208 --> 01:52:20.069]  And now they've been turned into zombies against us.
[01:52:21.482 --> 01:52:26.685]  So you may look at a big giant horde of zombies and look at how dumb they are and say, look how dumb those zombies are.
[01:52:26.905 --> 01:52:27.506]  Well, guess what?
[01:52:27.686 --> 01:52:29.046]  A thousand of them will eat your ass.
[01:52:31.208 --> 01:52:35.730]  And so I'm trying to quantify what I'm saying in some simple statement, but I think you get what I'm saying.
[01:52:36.971 --> 01:52:43.215]  I think we have to really just sit back and assess the fact that we're deep into the tyranny.
[01:52:44.079 --> 01:52:51.997]  I mean, my God, all the censorship, all the debanking, all the persecution, all the lies about us, all the things they've done to us.
[01:52:54.127 --> 01:52:57.590]  Conservatives and Christians and populists and capitalists are not like the left.
[01:52:57.630 --> 01:53:02.655]  We don't live in a world of being victims and whining, but they use our strength against us.
[01:53:03.075 --> 01:53:14.786]  We should all be beyond pissed off what they've done and not sit there and live in victimhood, but make our entire focus on exposing these people any way we can and not complying.
[01:53:15.666 --> 01:53:20.468]   And when we start acting like that, We're gonna beat this.
[01:53:20.928 --> 01:53:28.535]  That's all I'm saying is, when I say something to you, I'm like talking to myself like I'm in the shower, or walking down the park by myself, you know.
[01:53:29.036 --> 01:53:33.560]  You're not even talking out loud, but you're kind of talking to yourself about problems in life, or issues, or things.
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:35.482]  You have an internal dialogue going on.
[01:53:35.903 --> 01:53:40.127]  And my internal dialogue is like, we gotta bring it, man.
[01:53:41.088 --> 01:53:43.350]  And then I get frustrated and I say, how do we bring it?
[01:53:44.946 --> 01:53:51.351]  So I get it, we're looking at this big, frustrating, out of control, growing cancer, and we're gonna be upset.
[01:53:52.412 --> 01:53:58.512]   And that's natural, but I look at the smiley face neocons like Bill Kristol, calling for Tucker Carlson to be
[01:53:58.512 --> 01:53:59.612]  basically put in jail.
[01:53:59.612 --> 01:54:03.412]   And him being put on the hit list by the Ukrainian terrorist.
[01:54:03.412 --> 01:54:07.011]  And I just see all this crap we put up with.
[01:54:07.011 --> 01:54:11.212]  And I guess to quantify it, I'm just saying.
[01:54:11.212 --> 01:54:20.412]  That it's disgusting how far we've been drawn into this.
[01:54:20.835 --> 01:54:23.978]  It's pathetic what we've learned to put up with.
[01:54:25.619 --> 01:54:26.240]  But I get it.
[01:54:26.680 --> 01:54:34.488]  When you're up against a complex, heavily funded, psychotic enemy, and you're just an average person, how do you deal with it?
[01:54:35.629 --> 01:54:38.872]  And I guess it just goes back, in fact, I don't guess it goes back to God.
[01:54:41.254 --> 01:54:42.035]  It goes back to God.
[01:54:43.123 --> 01:54:48.484]  And it goes back to just having as much courage as you can and heroically telling the truth no matter what happens.
[01:54:48.944 --> 01:54:50.525]  And that's what Tucker Carlson's doing right now.
[01:54:52.245 --> 01:54:53.185]  And that's what I'm trying to do.
[01:54:54.345 --> 01:54:55.586]  That's what President Trump's trying to do.
[01:54:55.606 --> 01:54:57.166]  And that's what Elon Musk is trying to do.
[01:54:58.726 --> 01:55:00.527]  He's got legitimate enemies coming after him.
[01:55:00.867 --> 01:55:06.388]  He legitimately broke like Darth Vader in Return of the Jedi.
[01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:09.581]  With the New World Order at some point in the last two years.
[01:55:10.001 --> 01:55:17.325]  And you can feel it, you can see it, and there's all these holier-than-thou people that want to sit back and talk about how the strongman stumbled.
[01:55:17.365 --> 01:55:34.553]  But if we're not ready to have victory, if we're not ready promoting our vision of civilization and success and prosperity and security, and we're just used to thinking of the enemy as always being in charge and the establishment, then we're going to lose.
[01:55:34.853 --> 01:55:36.134]  They're illegitimate!
[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:39.581]  They're frauds.
[01:55:42.063 --> 01:55:50.351]  And you have to decide that you don't care what they say or what they do or what they do to you.
[01:55:50.832 --> 01:55:53.955]  You have to make the decision to survive.
[01:55:54.535 --> 01:55:56.938]  You have to make the decision to resist.
[01:55:57.378 --> 01:56:00.101]  You have to make the decision to thrive and be strong.
[01:56:01.590 --> 01:56:02.050]  And do it.
[01:56:02.910 --> 01:56:11.832]  And then just thank God and your lucky stars every day that you're not a sack of pedophile garbage like Joe Biden.
[01:56:14.052 --> 01:56:14.752]  Or the Pope.
[01:56:16.233 --> 01:56:22.314]  And when I say the Pope, Catholics are under globalist attack because they actually are still trying to follow God.
[01:56:22.534 --> 01:56:24.014]  But they seized our leaders, folks.
[01:56:24.274 --> 01:56:25.714]  Joe Biden's not the President.
[01:56:28.175 --> 01:56:29.495]  The Pope's not the Pope.
[01:56:32.430 --> 01:56:34.511]  All of our institutions have been seized.
[01:56:36.493 --> 01:56:38.374]  The Boy Scouts got taken over by pedophiles.
[01:56:40.935 --> 01:56:48.820]  The public schools, almost everything has been seized, and they don't have the authority over us.
[01:56:49.140 --> 01:56:50.381]  They are illegitimate.
[01:56:50.781 --> 01:56:54.264]  And that doesn't mean we go out and shoot them, because that'll turn them into victims.
[01:56:54.324 --> 01:56:55.785]  We shoot their ideas.
[01:56:56.145 --> 01:56:59.167]  We non-violently, politically decapitate their frauds.
[01:57:00.327 --> 01:57:07.420]   All right, that's kind of a Multi-direction rant there, but that's just what's in my mind.
[01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:11.683]  It's just the, just the sitting back and watching this.
[01:57:11.883 --> 01:57:17.608]  And it's, I feel guilty actually, even watching it and chronicling it.
[01:57:18.188 --> 01:57:19.129]  But see, I have a conscience.
[01:57:21.150 --> 01:57:21.991]  The globalists don't.
[01:57:25.974 --> 01:57:26.415]  They love it.
[01:57:28.216 --> 01:57:29.277]  They don't have any morals.
[01:57:30.278 --> 01:57:31.999]  To them being moral is hurting children.
[01:57:33.749 --> 01:57:41.415]  And the answer here is just giving them absolutely zero support and withdrawing all contact with the system.
[01:57:42.776 --> 01:57:51.102]  And you're going to find there's all these great organizations and churches and groups and companies and systems and banks that aren't the enemy.
[01:57:51.122 --> 01:57:55.626]  And that's why the enemy is racing with BlackRock and their pedophile god, Larry Fink.
[01:57:58.328 --> 01:58:01.230]  He may not rape kids personally, but he funds the pedophile propaganda.
[01:58:03.581 --> 01:58:09.313]  And we have to know that they've got to be defeated because God's watching.
[01:58:10.556 --> 01:58:12.660]  All right, we got Drew Hernandez coming up with big breaking news.
[01:58:13.317 --> 01:58:14.318]  Yeah, we're a Christian, right?
[01:58:14.738 --> 01:58:15.258]  I'm a Christian.
[01:58:15.338 --> 01:58:20.982]  If you could stand your ground as a Christian... I'm a Christian too, so... So how can you justify breaking the law on a daily basis?
[01:58:21.002 --> 01:58:22.462]  This is not your country.
[01:58:22.502 --> 01:58:23.423]  You think this is your country?
[01:58:23.463 --> 01:58:24.163]  Yes, I'm an American.
[01:58:24.183 --> 01:58:24.844]  This is my country.
[01:58:24.864 --> 01:58:25.344]  F*** America!
[01:58:25.384 --> 01:58:26.525]  This is a... Where are you from?
[01:58:26.545 --> 01:58:27.686]  This is a Mexican territory.
[01:58:27.706 --> 01:58:28.566]  So you're a Christian, right?
[01:58:28.646 --> 01:58:29.146]  You're a Christian?
[01:58:29.166 --> 01:58:29.447]  So what?
[01:58:29.687 --> 01:58:30.267]  Are you a Christian?
[01:58:30.287 --> 01:58:30.587]  So what?
[01:58:30.707 --> 01:58:31.468]  What does that have to do with you?
[01:58:31.488 --> 01:58:32.148]  So now you're cussing me out.
[01:58:32.168 --> 01:58:33.029]  What does that have to do with you?
[01:58:33.049 --> 01:58:34.209]  What country are you from?
[01:58:34.229 --> 01:58:34.830]  Why do you care?
[01:58:35.230 --> 01:58:36.271]  Because this is my country.
[01:58:36.291 --> 01:58:37.491]  This is my country too!
[01:58:37.571 --> 01:58:38.352]  No, I'm an American.
[01:58:38.992 --> 01:58:40.073]  I'm an American too.
[01:58:40.093 --> 01:58:41.354]  I'm an American too.
[01:58:41.494 --> 01:58:42.174]  Are you an American?
[01:58:42.194 --> 01:58:42.654]  Of course.
[01:58:42.694 --> 01:58:44.195]  What city are you from?
[01:58:44.235 --> 01:58:45.136]  None of your business.
[01:58:45.356 --> 01:58:46.277]  Yes it is my business.
[01:58:46.757 --> 01:58:47.998]  Because this is illegal right here.
[01:58:48.038 --> 01:58:50.339]  You guys are aiding and abetting a human trafficking operation.
[01:58:50.359 --> 01:58:52.400]  You're claiming to be Christian, doing it in the name of God.
[01:58:53.201 --> 01:58:57.463]  So why are you facilitating and encouraging illegal immigration, breaking the law?
[01:58:57.623 --> 01:58:59.945]  Are you doing it in the name of Jesus?
[01:59:00.025 --> 01:59:03.887]  You claim to be doing the work of Jesus Christ, but Jesus Christ is not about lawlessness.
[01:59:04.577 --> 01:59:05.418]  You're right.
[01:59:05.898 --> 01:59:09.261]  So why are you operating in a capacity where this is a lawless operation?
[01:59:09.281 --> 01:59:11.423]  You want to get a minimum pay or something?
[01:59:11.463 --> 01:59:12.103]  Is that what it is?
[01:59:12.123 --> 01:59:12.704]  No, no, no.
[01:59:12.724 --> 01:59:13.444]  You want pay?
[01:59:13.504 --> 01:59:14.665]  No, I want my country to be secure.
[01:59:14.685 --> 01:59:16.767]  You want to say that you confront us and you got away with it?
[01:59:16.807 --> 01:59:18.308]  No, I want my country to be secure.
[01:59:18.608 --> 01:59:18.809]  Yes.
[01:59:18.889 --> 01:59:21.331]  And if you are here illegally, I want you to come legally.
[01:59:21.351 --> 01:59:21.611]  Illegally?
[01:59:22.071 --> 01:59:22.912]  It's not illegally.
[01:59:23.132 --> 01:59:24.173]  Okay, this is an illegal operation.
[01:59:24.193 --> 01:59:26.695]  The whole world is fucking... No, this is a country.
[01:59:26.795 --> 01:59:27.836]  We have laws, sir.
[01:59:28.356 --> 01:59:29.917]  You have to abide by our laws.
[01:59:30.538 --> 01:59:32.920]  And if you're not going to abide by our laws, you don't belong here.
[01:59:33.897 --> 01:59:36.160]  This is an entire operation that's illegal.
[01:59:36.620 --> 01:59:38.703]  It's human trafficking, aiding and abetting.
[01:59:39.023 --> 01:59:39.644]  You know what?
[01:59:39.664 --> 01:59:41.646]  Go find somebody who cares about your stuff.
[01:59:41.706 --> 01:59:42.367]  America cares.
[01:59:42.407 --> 01:59:42.887]  We don't care.
[01:59:42.907 --> 01:59:44.289]  He's looking at that camera.
[01:59:44.349 --> 01:59:45.390]  America cares, sir.
[01:59:45.610 --> 01:59:47.072]  Go find somebody who cares.
[01:59:47.352 --> 01:59:47.753]  America cares.
[01:59:47.813 --> 01:59:48.273]  Leave us alone.
[01:59:48.293 --> 01:59:48.754]  You know what?
[01:59:48.814 --> 01:59:49.595]  When you want to fight?
[01:59:49.735 --> 01:59:52.556]  If you're going to come down, you're the one getting violent here.
[01:59:52.576 --> 01:59:53.676]  You're the one getting violent.
[01:59:53.696 --> 01:59:54.916]  You're the one, you got to calm down.
[01:59:54.936 --> 01:59:55.756]  This is my country.
[01:59:55.896 --> 01:59:56.877]  I'm an American.
[01:59:56.897 --> 01:59:57.537]  This is my country.
[01:59:57.777 --> 02:00:00.437]  You won't even tell me if you're a citizen or not.
[02:00:00.477 --> 02:00:01.138]  You won't provide.
[02:00:01.158 --> 02:00:01.298]  Why?
[02:00:01.318 --> 02:00:02.598]  Because you're an authority.
[02:00:02.618 --> 02:00:03.978]  You don't have any authority.
[02:00:03.818 --> 02:00:04.818]  You cannot tell me what to do.
[02:00:04.818 --> 02:00:05.818]  This is my country too.
[02:00:05.818 --> 02:00:06.818]  This is my country.
[02:00:06.818 --> 02:00:09.057]  No, you won't even tell me if you're a citizen or not.
[02:00:09.057 --> 02:00:10.057]  You won't provide me.
[02:00:10.057 --> 02:00:11.057]  Why?
[02:00:11.057 --> 02:00:12.057]  Why?
[02:00:12.057 --> 02:00:13.057]  Because.
[02:00:13.057 --> 02:00:14.057]  You're an authority.
[02:00:14.057 --> 02:00:15.057]  I just told you.
[02:00:15.057 --> 02:00:16.057]  You don't have any authority.
[02:00:16.057 --> 02:00:18.057]  Yeah, I'm just asking you a question.
[02:00:18.063 --> 02:00:19.304]  You want to know what my authority is?
[02:00:19.324 --> 02:00:20.104]  Do I have to answer?
[02:00:20.285 --> 02:00:21.445]  You want to know what my authority is?
[02:00:21.805 --> 02:00:27.288]  This is an illegal human trafficking operation and I want to know if you're an American participating in it or not.
[02:00:29.730 --> 02:00:35.533]  That's Drew Hernandez on the California-Mexico border in the dead of night alone confronting smugglers.
[02:00:36.053 --> 02:00:38.014]  There's hours of this bombshell footage.
[02:00:38.935 --> 02:00:43.017]  He's posted on his ex-account and we've been relinking to the real Alex Jones.
[02:00:43.057 --> 02:00:44.398]  He joins us coming up next segment.
[02:00:46.221 --> 02:01:03.128]   And the arrogance that goes on against this country where America is seen as a doormat and then they smuggle these people and use them for slave labor and use them for sex slavery and our government Is running the whole thing.
[02:01:03.168 --> 02:01:04.549]  Mayorkas is running it all.
[02:01:05.329 --> 02:01:08.711]  I know we all know that, but just think about what they'll do next.
[02:01:08.751 --> 02:01:11.852]  They've already gotten away with all this mass crime.
[02:01:11.872 --> 02:01:15.253]  500,000 children they admit they brought in in Senate reports.
[02:01:16.354 --> 02:01:17.974]  90 plus thousand are just missing.
[02:01:18.454 --> 02:01:24.797]  They found a bunch of them in sex slavery or working at tire factories and cereal factories when they're 12 years old.
[02:01:27.691 --> 02:01:37.274]  But oh, they're anti-racist, so it's okay to bring in the brown kids and use them as slaves after they shut down Latin America with the COVID lockdowns.
[02:01:38.334 --> 02:01:45.216]  And I've got all these new clips of John Kerry and Tedros saying food is the problem.
[02:01:47.277 --> 02:01:49.497]  We must cut the food off to save the world.
[02:01:49.617 --> 02:01:51.278]  We will starve if we don't cut the food off.
[02:01:52.557 --> 02:01:54.998]  We must run the fuel out of your gas tank.
[02:01:55.298 --> 02:01:58.840]  You must let your gas tank go to empty or your car will run out of gas.
[02:02:00.141 --> 02:02:02.482]  You must shoot yourself in the head or you will bleed to death.
[02:02:02.502 --> 02:02:04.383]  I have another clip.
[02:02:04.403 --> 02:02:06.664]  I noticed it wasn't on the list but it was on my ex account.
[02:02:07.424 --> 02:02:08.365]  I retweeted it yesterday.
[02:02:08.845 --> 02:02:12.607]  Tedros talked about the epidemic of genital mutilation.
[02:02:12.627 --> 02:02:13.928]  He didn't say it was Muslims doing it.
[02:02:14.308 --> 02:02:14.928]  That's who's doing it.
[02:02:15.188 --> 02:02:20.451]  But millions of little girls a year have their clitoris cut off.
[02:02:23.106 --> 02:02:23.926]  And he's against that.
[02:02:24.527 --> 02:02:25.287]  I'm against it too.
[02:02:26.967 --> 02:02:34.490]  But the commenters were like, wait a minute, but we're cutting little boys' genitals off and little girls' breasts off, but that's the medical system, so that's okay.
[02:02:34.530 --> 02:02:35.370]  I'll give it to the Muslims.
[02:02:36.691 --> 02:02:45.594]  Cutting a girl's clitoris off is abusive and maims her for life and all the rest of it, but they're not cutting the whole thing out.
[02:02:47.694 --> 02:02:48.915]  They're not cutting her breast off.
[02:02:51.129 --> 02:02:56.832]  So, the Muslims, on the scale of evil, of 1 to 10, on mutilating children, are like a 5.
[02:02:59.094 --> 02:03:00.755]  And the Western system's a 10.
[02:03:03.156 --> 02:03:04.357]  So imagine, your daughter's born.
[02:03:04.377 --> 02:03:05.537]  I hate to be gross here, folks.
[02:03:05.938 --> 02:03:09.900]  But, you know, God gave that to the women, enjoyment with her husband.
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:12.641]  It's a part of having fun.
[02:03:13.142 --> 02:03:14.322]  God wants us to have children.
[02:03:14.382 --> 02:03:15.143]  God designed us.
[02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:21.481]  And the Muslims, for a thousand years, cut their daughters' clitorises off.
[02:03:22.642 --> 02:03:22.922]  All right?
[02:03:23.122 --> 02:03:25.403]  You can say, well, the Jews cut the foreskin off the penis.
[02:03:25.823 --> 02:03:26.383]  How about this?
[02:03:26.603 --> 02:03:28.463]  How about we stop cutting kids' junk off?
[02:03:29.644 --> 02:03:31.124]  God gave it to us, let's leave it on.
[02:03:33.305 --> 02:03:33.745]  I hear you.
[02:03:34.185 --> 02:03:38.146]  A baby can't decide whether he wants his foreskin cut off, and so it's wrong.
[02:03:42.367 --> 02:03:43.348]  But it's ritual abuse.
[02:03:43.208 --> 02:03:45.208]  Well, you know, I want it to look like mine.
[02:03:45.208 --> 02:03:54.208]  And then you're gonna cut little girls up.
[02:03:54.208 --> 02:04:04.208]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:03:55.477 --> 02:03:56.938]  But we all agree, right?
[02:03:56.998 --> 02:03:59.139]  Cutting the breast off and the whole thing off is bad.
[02:03:59.439 --> 02:04:00.840]  Well, I think cutting any of it off is bad.
[02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:02.861]  Well, I'm not going to cut your whole nose off.
[02:04:03.161 --> 02:04:05.322]  I'm just going to cut the first half inch off.
[02:04:05.342 --> 02:04:05.863]  Is that okay?
[02:04:06.223 --> 02:04:08.184]  I'm not going to pull all your teeth out with pliers.
[02:04:08.464 --> 02:04:09.965]  I'm just going to pull the front teeth out.
[02:04:13.346 --> 02:04:16.488]  Is it wrong to pull one child's tooth out that's healthy?
[02:04:17.989 --> 02:04:18.169]  Yeah.
[02:04:18.569 --> 02:04:19.549]  Is it wrong to pull them all out?
[02:04:19.589 --> 02:04:19.749]  Yeah.
[02:04:22.066 --> 02:04:31.113]  And look, I don't want to get up here and talk about this sickness, but where does it come from to chop little boys' penises up?
[02:04:31.594 --> 02:04:32.654]  Where is the obsession?
[02:04:35.417 --> 02:04:36.277]  The Jews are doing it.
[02:04:37.698 --> 02:04:38.699]  The Muslims are doing it.
[02:04:39.980 --> 02:04:41.001]  The Christians are doing it.
[02:04:43.943 --> 02:04:45.705]  There's weird tribes in Africa doing it.
[02:04:46.265 --> 02:04:47.066]  There's weird stuff.
[02:04:47.326 --> 02:04:54.336]   Every culture gets in a position where they start Chopping up body parts on people's genitals.
[02:04:55.337 --> 02:04:57.358]  How about hands off our children's genitals?
[02:04:57.698 --> 02:05:07.446]  Remember the Surgeon General nominee of Clinton's went on television and said, I want to teach teachers to masturbate one-year-olds.
[02:05:07.846 --> 02:05:09.568]  Reach down and do it for her.
[02:05:09.588 --> 02:05:10.228]  That's what she talked.
[02:05:10.788 --> 02:05:12.470]  Help them masturbate.
[02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:15.221]  You're like, oh, what a sick, evil woman.
[02:05:15.621 --> 02:05:17.622]  Hell, she just wanted to have the kids masturbate.
[02:05:17.642 --> 02:05:22.363]  That's bad enough to have some teacher grabbing your kid's genitals?
[02:05:22.403 --> 02:05:22.804]  What the?
[02:05:23.124 --> 02:05:24.424]  That's pedophilia, okay?
[02:05:25.905 --> 02:05:29.866]  And so that's a 10 on a scale, but now the scale goes to 100.
[02:05:29.906 --> 02:05:39.550]  Because I'm not lessening that, but I mean, I'll tell you, fiddling with it, what's that compared to chopping it off?
[02:05:41.343 --> 02:05:46.046]  You see, what is this satanic obsession with our reproduction?
[02:05:47.127 --> 02:05:49.629]  Because the devil wants to kill humans.
[02:05:49.969 --> 02:05:50.810]  Kill, steal, and destroy.
[02:05:51.090 --> 02:05:52.791]  The devil doesn't want us to have children.
[02:05:53.052 --> 02:05:54.453]  The devil doesn't want us to have families.
[02:05:54.713 --> 02:05:58.355]  The devil doesn't want men and women married to have enjoyment together.
[02:05:58.596 --> 02:06:03.039]  Oh, God gave us these bodies and sex and life and all this.
[02:06:03.059 --> 02:06:03.980]  That didn't come from the devil.
[02:06:04.240 --> 02:06:06.001]  The devil always sells his stuff with sex.
[02:06:06.621 --> 02:06:07.962]  An abomination of sex.
[02:06:09.051 --> 02:06:10.411]  A distortion of sex.
[02:06:11.312 --> 02:06:13.232]  Not the real thing it's supposed to be.
[02:06:13.252 --> 02:06:19.394]  So we'll talk to Drew Hernandez, great reporter from Forbes, also really smart pastor.
[02:06:20.174 --> 02:06:23.415]  On the ground, he's been knocking it out of the park when we come back.
[02:06:24.375 --> 02:06:27.776]  And then, who's on the fourth hour here?
[02:06:28.496 --> 02:06:34.158]  Oh, the mighty, always informative, boy, he does his research, Jason Burmess.
[02:06:35.307 --> 02:06:37.089]  And then Owen Schroyer, 3 p.m.
[02:06:37.169 --> 02:06:39.472]  Central today, The War Room.
[02:06:39.813 --> 02:06:50.446]  And whatever time, Tucker, since there's different numbers put out, whether it's 6 or 7 Central, whatever it is, we'll be here tomorrow covering the Putin interview, live on air.

[02:07:53.210 --> 02:07:57.952]  You know, it's during these breaks that I literally bow my head and ask God to give me information.
[02:07:58.952 --> 02:08:03.769]   And during the break, I just bowed my head for about a minute and I said, What should I say on air?
[02:08:03.909 --> 02:08:04.890]  And literally, it just came to me.
[02:08:05.710 --> 02:08:07.130]  Look how far we've come.
[02:08:08.311 --> 02:08:11.572]  When I first got on air 29 plus years ago, almost nobody knew about this.
[02:08:12.192 --> 02:08:12.792]  I don't get the credit.
[02:08:12.812 --> 02:08:14.753]  It's just the fact that the new world order came into play.
[02:08:14.853 --> 02:08:15.513]  It's out in the open now.
[02:08:15.533 --> 02:08:16.393]  That's why people are waking up.
[02:08:16.894 --> 02:08:24.956]  But look where we are now with Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan waking up and all the other top talk show hosts are anti-globalists now.
[02:08:25.416 --> 02:08:27.097]  And more and more people are joining us.
[02:08:28.140 --> 02:08:32.204]  So as negative as things are, incredibly positive things are happening.
[02:08:32.245 --> 02:08:35.528]  And then the Ukrainian government putting Tucker on a hit list.
[02:08:36.409 --> 02:08:40.213]  They put Jack Posobiec on six months ago and they ended up firing the person that did that.
[02:08:40.233 --> 02:08:41.835]  It was a Senate investigation.
[02:08:42.335 --> 02:08:47.921]  We're forcing the enemy to take the gloves off and take their mask off and get out in the open.
[02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:52.181]  So as negative as things are, at least we're in a fight now.
[02:08:52.561 --> 02:08:56.543]  And we're in a way better position than we were just a year ago, two years ago, three years ago.
[02:08:56.943 --> 02:08:59.884]  Alright, Drew Hernandez is back at his hotel in a safer zone.
[02:09:00.384 --> 02:09:04.666]  He said, listen, there's some stuff happening at the Texas border when he was there this week, over the weekend.
[02:09:04.686 --> 02:09:06.087]  He said, I want to go to California.
[02:09:06.147 --> 02:09:08.548]  That's where I'm told the crazy stuff is.
[02:09:09.148 --> 02:09:11.589]  And the footage he got by himself in the dark of night.
[02:09:13.303 --> 02:09:15.444]  Inside the illegal alien camps and the U.N.
[02:09:15.844 --> 02:09:17.685]  and the smugglers and confronting.
[02:09:17.705 --> 02:09:22.128]  Remember me and Drew went confronted smugglers and stopped the car and all that in South Texas?
[02:09:22.148 --> 02:09:23.128]  Well, he did it again.
[02:09:23.148 --> 02:09:28.231]  And I almost want to tell him, man, dude, be, you know, be safe because it's dangerous.
[02:09:28.631 --> 02:09:30.793]  And the things they were saying, the arrogance.
[02:09:30.853 --> 02:09:33.294]  So they got a lot of footage and it was not even out yet.
[02:09:33.334 --> 02:09:34.455]  You've already put out so much.
[02:09:34.955 --> 02:09:36.096]  Drew, crazy.
[02:09:36.116 --> 02:09:38.377]  I want to talk about the border, what you've witnessed.
[02:09:38.797 --> 02:09:49.825]  What Biden's trying to do right now, spinning this, but before we go there, Tucker Carlson, the Putin interview, the open attempts at censorship, where America is, how would you describe the world today?
[02:09:51.158 --> 02:09:54.519]  Well, I think right now the world is exactly where Jesus said it would be.
[02:09:55.019 --> 02:10:03.261]  With lawlessness abounding and the rise of deception, which is right now in the 21st century, you're going to see that unfolding within the media predominantly.
[02:10:03.381 --> 02:10:09.282]  And this is why it's so important to become a part of the counter-narrative as we put forth the truth.
[02:10:09.423 --> 02:10:11.903]  And I think Tucker Carlson is trailblazing.
[02:10:12.563 --> 02:10:14.204]  When I saw what he was doing, I was crazy.
[02:10:14.224 --> 02:10:17.906]   And the response I think they're really going to Assange Tucker.
[02:10:18.667 --> 02:10:22.310]  I think they really are going to move maybe Snowden him as well.
[02:10:22.330 --> 02:10:23.871]  But you know, this is what's necessary.
[02:10:24.251 --> 02:10:26.333]  This is what's absolutely necessary right now.
[02:10:26.393 --> 02:10:36.642]  These peaceful actions, these peaceful moves that are made by simply just doing acts of journalism, reporting and interviews with world leaders.
[02:10:36.662 --> 02:10:37.683]  What are they so scared of?
[02:10:37.763 --> 02:10:38.303]  Exactly.
[02:10:38.904 --> 02:10:40.745]  Folks, remember, it's free speech.
[02:10:40.805 --> 02:10:41.466]  It's an interview.
[02:10:41.726 --> 02:10:42.627]  How do we get to this?
[02:10:44.062 --> 02:10:45.763]  We got to this because we've allowed it.
[02:10:46.003 --> 02:10:49.266]  And we've got to this point now where they are showing their true colors.
[02:10:49.686 --> 02:11:01.114]  And I think that's part of the move and that's what people are gonna see because they've attempted really aggressively to villainize Vladimir Putin, Russia, whatever your views may be on Putin and Russia.
[02:11:01.174 --> 02:11:03.596]  That's your own personal viewpoint, but you got it.
[02:11:03.636 --> 02:11:10.120]  You still can't avoid the fact that everything and anybody that they disagree with is a Russian agent.
[02:11:10.441 --> 02:11:15.884]   Even when Nancy Pelosi gets confronted in San Francisco, By these pro-Hamas protesters.
[02:11:16.084 --> 02:11:19.587]  What is her regurgitated NPC automatic response?
[02:11:20.327 --> 02:11:22.689]  Russian agents, Russian agents, Russian agents.
[02:11:22.769 --> 02:11:28.252]  The EU is trying to ban all the farmer protests as they turn their fuel and fertilizer off saying they work for Putin.
[02:11:28.472 --> 02:11:30.714]  No, you're destroying their livelihood.
[02:11:30.954 --> 02:11:32.275]  They're fighting for their lives.
[02:11:32.515 --> 02:11:33.696]  Putin has nothing to do with it.
[02:11:34.878 --> 02:11:36.860]  Absolutely, and the narrative is crumbling.
[02:11:36.900 --> 02:11:38.241]  That's the point I'm trying to make here.
[02:11:39.021 --> 02:11:50.970]  This whole fabricated narrative where everything's a Russian agent, I mean, it crumbled and it fell apart post-2016 election where they tried to claim that it was Russian interference and Donald J. Trump, he colluded with the Russians.
[02:11:51.010 --> 02:11:54.472]  Oh, they act like Russians are like leprechauns that have magical powers.
[02:11:55.593 --> 02:11:56.594]  When in reality, it's them.
[02:11:57.290 --> 02:11:59.252]  They're the ones committing election interference.
[02:11:59.512 --> 02:12:00.473]  They're the ones.
[02:12:00.553 --> 02:12:05.777]  It's the weaponized FBI working alongside Twitter 1.0 to shut down the Hunter Biden laptop story.
[02:12:06.037 --> 02:12:08.218]  They're the ones in their globalist corruption.
[02:12:08.459 --> 02:12:09.940]  They're the ones with their tyranny.
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:14.623]  They're the ones that are suppressing American constitutional free, God-given inalienable rights.
[02:12:14.884 --> 02:12:17.045]  See, but this is what's important right now.
[02:12:17.526 --> 02:12:18.346]  And I just want to say this.
[02:12:18.366 --> 02:12:21.649]  I don't want to switch the subject off the border, but we're talking about Tucker.
[02:12:22.069 --> 02:12:24.251]  I want people to really pay attention to the response.
[02:12:24.751 --> 02:12:27.974]  Because the response of these people is what's really red-pilling people.
[02:12:28.335 --> 02:12:39.886]  I think the response of how they're going to react, putting Tucker on a kill list, okay, because he's a journalist and a reporter, interviewing someone unauthorized, what does that mean for all of us?
[02:12:40.246 --> 02:12:47.073]  Listen, listen, a journalist is not someone that went to school and has been appointed because they have some kind of a degree.
[02:12:47.493 --> 02:12:49.155]  A journalist is the First Amendment.
[02:12:49.715 --> 02:12:54.517]  Okay, like and that's not to knock anybody that has gone to school that has got a degree to do this.
[02:12:54.817 --> 02:12:58.179]  The point is this is it's an attack on America.
[02:12:58.459 --> 02:12:59.960]  It's not an attack on Tucker.
[02:13:00.340 --> 02:13:02.060]  It's an attack on American views.
[02:13:02.481 --> 02:13:05.662]  And I don't know if that's Tucker's intention.
[02:13:06.391 --> 02:13:09.654]  He kind of mentioned that in his video, but that's what people are going to see.
[02:13:09.714 --> 02:13:12.757]  So you've got to pay really close attention to the response of these people.
[02:13:12.777 --> 02:13:14.939]  I totally agree, and it's blowing up in their face.
[02:13:15.299 --> 02:13:18.402]  The little video he put out yesterday has 85 million views.
[02:13:19.243 --> 02:13:22.146]  That's the thing, don't they, if they would have just shut up, it wouldn't have been a big deal.
[02:13:23.363 --> 02:13:27.705]  Absolutely, and people are waking up to the reality that their rights are being violated.
[02:13:27.845 --> 02:13:29.766]  And especially with this border stuff, Alex.
[02:13:29.806 --> 02:13:33.147]  I mean, for all the info warriors out there, I make it a point all the time.
[02:13:33.187 --> 02:13:37.009]  Whenever I'm on the ground, I go report on something, it's totally breaching the matrix.
[02:13:37.894 --> 02:13:39.755]  I make it a point to send it to my family.
[02:13:39.795 --> 02:13:41.296]  I'll send this stuff to my mom.
[02:13:41.336 --> 02:13:43.738]  I'll send this to all my liberal family members.
[02:13:43.798 --> 02:13:46.059]  And I'm like, this is what's going on.
[02:13:46.119 --> 02:13:47.020]  How do you feel about this?
[02:13:47.060 --> 02:13:58.466]  And those little, you know, transmission sending to your family members, that really does a lot because I'm getting a lot of people, especially Californians, they're like, wait, wait, wait, wait, let me ask you something.
[02:13:58.486 --> 02:13:58.746]  Hold on.
[02:13:59.627 --> 02:14:01.888]  They're like, that's not in Mexico, right?
[02:14:01.928 --> 02:14:04.590]  I'm like, no, that's an hour south of San Diego.
[02:14:05.621 --> 02:14:11.687]  And you have these military-aged male encampments, alright, by the hundreds in your own damn backyard.
[02:14:11.728 --> 02:14:12.048]  Exactly.
[02:14:12.088 --> 02:14:13.850]  Start over and describe what you found.
[02:14:14.170 --> 02:14:14.871]  This is insane.
[02:14:15.874 --> 02:14:20.678]  Yeah, so before we get into this guy, I had a little, you know, this fussy little Mexican guy.
[02:14:21.419 --> 02:14:25.702]  Before we got into it with him, we show up to Jacumba in Southern California.
[02:14:25.803 --> 02:14:30.847]  And for those of you unfamiliar with the area, this is why I really wanted to shine a spotlight on this.
[02:14:31.407 --> 02:14:33.869]  Because I believe it's getting under-reported.
[02:14:33.910 --> 02:14:36.932]  There are several on-the-ground reporters, border journalists down there.
[02:14:36.952 --> 02:14:38.634]  There's plenty of reporting at Eagle Pass.
[02:14:38.674 --> 02:14:40.435]  There's plenty of reporting at Gary and Gab.
[02:14:40.855 --> 02:14:42.437]  It's all the other places they don't want us to look.
[02:14:43.394 --> 02:14:43.954]  Absolutely.
[02:14:44.054 --> 02:14:56.040]  So while we were in Eagle Pass, the InfoWars team that was there before me did a great, phenomenal job, but things slowed down and we had conversations with our InfoWars border patrol source within, and we had a full conversation.
[02:14:56.080 --> 02:14:58.621]  I said, where do you think would be the spot right now?
[02:14:58.641 --> 02:14:59.922]  Should we stay here in Eagle Pass?
[02:15:00.042 --> 02:15:04.584]  Abbott's going to come tomorrow, give his little photo op speech, or should we go somewhere else?
[02:15:05.104 --> 02:15:10.066]   And they told me straight up, I think you would be better off going to Jocumbo, California, Because it's popping there right now.
[02:15:10.386 --> 02:15:11.787]  And these people are coming straight over.
[02:15:11.827 --> 02:15:14.687]  So the photo op in Texas, yes, things have slowed down.
[02:15:14.987 --> 02:15:21.629]  There are little pockets here, there, Eagle Pass, other sectors in Texas, but it seems like they're rerouting.
[02:15:21.729 --> 02:15:26.430]  Southern Arizona, Sasabe, has been getting flooded overnight with illegals.
[02:15:26.950 --> 02:15:28.590]  And obviously, Jucumba, California.
[02:15:28.610 --> 02:15:29.370]  So we rerouted.
[02:15:30.331 --> 02:15:31.251]  And we went down.
[02:15:32.151 --> 02:15:43.613]   And this whole section, there's in Jucumba, there's this, like I said, it's about an hour south From SeaWorld in San Diego, just to give you San Diegans out there in Southern California is how close this is.
[02:15:44.214 --> 02:15:46.835]  And there's a west side and an east side on the border wall.
[02:15:47.535 --> 02:15:56.240]  On the west side, the only thing stopping the illegals from getting in is literally just bobbed wire and they go around the gate and they come straight into the United States.
[02:15:56.300 --> 02:16:02.103]  There's an encampment right there and they turn themselves in to border patrol just like we've been seeing across the US.
[02:16:02.744 --> 02:16:10.440]   And then there's another section on the east side On this border wall in Chacumba, California, where there is no one there.
[02:16:10.720 --> 02:16:15.261]  The barbed wire is all trampled on and people could just walk directly through.
[02:16:15.961 --> 02:16:17.261]  And here's what's interesting about this.
[02:16:17.281 --> 02:16:20.422]  And this brings me to this this fussy little Mexican guy that I debated.
[02:16:20.862 --> 02:16:25.723]  So on that east side, Alex, where they're coming straight through, it's about an hour and a half walk.
[02:16:26.523 --> 02:16:30.784]  I would estimate an hour at the least walk on foot through the hills in Chacumba.
[02:16:31.573 --> 02:16:37.196]  Where you walk through from this east side, where there's no one stopping you, there's no border patrol, there's nobody there.
[02:16:37.596 --> 02:16:50.523]  And the illegals come through, and they walk about an hour, an hour and a half through the hills in Jocumbo, and there's a little encampment off of the Old Town 80 Highway in Jocumbo.
[02:16:50.743 --> 02:16:52.243]  This is in San Diego County.
[02:16:52.263 --> 02:16:54.985]  So they walk about an hour and a half into the United States.
[02:16:55.405 --> 02:16:57.408]  And there's an encampment right off the freeway!
[02:16:57.808 --> 02:17:05.297]  And this is where I confronted these fake Christian humanitarians, where they show up and they're giving them supplies and they're claiming to be Christians.
[02:17:05.958 --> 02:17:07.319]  And that's what pissed me off, you know?
[02:17:07.960 --> 02:17:10.223]  You know they're getting paid by the UN.
[02:17:10.603 --> 02:17:12.986]  What you get is the bait for all these people.
[02:17:13.877 --> 02:17:18.942]  Yes, we know that these are NGOs, but that's why I was really pressing them to get a confirmation on camera.
[02:17:18.962 --> 02:17:23.566]  You know how it works, Alex, but we can assume because that's the majority that we have seen.
[02:17:23.626 --> 02:17:25.808]  But they just claim to be Christians.
[02:17:25.928 --> 02:17:27.850]  They claim to be doing the word of God.
[02:17:28.250 --> 02:17:32.274]  And that's what really pissed me off the most because I'm like, okay, now we're going to have a conversation.
[02:17:32.795 --> 02:17:33.976]  So you can't sit here.
[02:17:34.016 --> 02:17:36.278]  And I think this is part of what needs to happen, Alex.
[02:17:37.325 --> 02:17:41.169]  Uh, right now in 2024, we really do need to separate the sheep from the goats.
[02:17:41.509 --> 02:17:50.938]  Like, we should have a zero-tolerance policy for anybody, uh, that is showing any signs of anti-American rhetoric or actions or views.
[02:17:51.298 --> 02:17:52.620]  I don't care what color you are.
[02:17:52.700 --> 02:17:53.501]  I don't care where you come from.
[02:17:53.521 --> 02:17:53.841]  Well, that's it.
[02:17:53.861 --> 02:17:55.723]  It's not that we would hate the victims they're bringing in.
[02:17:56.083 --> 02:17:58.125]  It's that it's being organized to bring the country down.
[02:17:59.145 --> 02:17:59.746]  Absolutely.
[02:17:59.906 --> 02:18:01.787]  And so that's why I confront these guys.
[02:18:01.807 --> 02:18:04.810]  It's like you're going to sit here and tell me, oh, we're doing the work of God.
[02:18:04.850 --> 02:18:05.511]  You point up.
[02:18:05.551 --> 02:18:08.013]  So I confront them because we need to separate this.
[02:18:08.033 --> 02:18:08.774]  All right.
[02:18:08.794 --> 02:18:09.975]  Because this has happened to us.
[02:18:10.055 --> 02:18:10.495]  Right, Alex?
[02:18:10.515 --> 02:18:11.476]  This is part of the op.
[02:18:12.122 --> 02:18:15.063]  That they're running with these NGOs and these humanitarian groups.
[02:18:15.083 --> 02:18:21.044]  The last, I think it was 2021, where we went down and we confronted the human traffickers in the middle of the street in broad daylight.
[02:18:21.364 --> 02:18:23.525]  What was the response of the mainstream local media?
[02:18:23.865 --> 02:18:34.688]  The response was Alex Jones, InfoWars, Drew Hernandez, ATT&CK, a Catholic charity, non-government organization, a humanitarian effort, and tried to really, you know, victimize the situation.
[02:18:34.708 --> 02:18:38.591]   And not only the illegals, But they try to victimize the NGOs themselves.
[02:18:38.871 --> 02:18:44.738]  They try to spin it on you like you're the one that is anti-Christian when they're anti-Christ.
[02:18:44.978 --> 02:18:47.962]  This whole operation is lawless and it's anti-Christ.
[02:18:48.122 --> 02:18:53.108]  See, this is why I'm telling people, have these type of peaceful confrontations.
[02:18:53.608 --> 02:18:55.070]  You don't have to get aggressive.
[02:18:55.491 --> 02:18:56.592]  You don't have to get violent.
[02:18:57.250 --> 02:19:10.594]  All you got to do is walk up and ask them, especially if they claim to be Christians, OK, what is your justification to you aiding and abetting this illegal operation here in my country, in the United States of America?
[02:19:10.814 --> 02:19:11.774]  That's my authority.
[02:19:11.894 --> 02:19:15.835]  As a Christian, I have the authority to question you because you claim to be a Christian, number one.
[02:19:16.055 --> 02:19:22.897]  Number two, I have the authority to question you because there's an illegal operation taking place right before my very eyes and I'm watching you do it.
[02:19:23.277 --> 02:19:24.358]  I need an answer from you.
[02:19:24.558 --> 02:19:25.378]  Why are you doing this?
[02:19:25.598 --> 02:19:26.418]  How are you doing this?
[02:19:26.498 --> 02:19:27.679]  And they, you want to know Alex?
[02:19:27.899 --> 02:19:40.702]  You want to know why these so-called Christian Catholic NGOs, they can't provide an answer to justify aiding and abetting human trafficking operations, encouraging and incentivizing more illegal immigration for these people to come here?
[02:19:40.922 --> 02:19:42.402]  Because there isn't an answer, Alex.
[02:19:43.062 --> 02:19:44.243]  There is no answer to this.
[02:19:44.303 --> 02:19:45.563]  There is no answer in the Bible.
[02:19:45.783 --> 02:19:50.284]  There is no answer in the scriptures, because Jesus Christ does not encourage lawlessness.
[02:19:50.484 --> 02:19:51.024]  Well, let's be clear.
[02:19:51.044 --> 02:19:51.484]  It's that simple.
[02:19:51.504 --> 02:19:55.465]   They're bringing, we caught new footage I got sent by Border Patrol, Because they're nothing but commodities.
[02:19:55.525 --> 02:19:56.986]  That's what people need to understand.
[02:19:57.286 --> 02:19:58.966]  Yeah, this is the slave traffic, folks.
[02:19:58.986 --> 02:20:00.607]  This is modern slavery.
[02:20:00.627 --> 02:20:02.247]  We go, oh, they're here for a better life.
[02:20:02.067 --> 02:20:05.926]   over to an NGO and let them disappear again to see him a month later.
[02:20:05.926 --> 02:20:09.286]   And that's what's really getting to the Border Patrol is they keep saying the kids being
[02:20:09.286 --> 02:20:12.527]  used over and over again.
[02:20:12.527 --> 02:20:14.647]  Because they're nothing but commodities.
[02:20:14.647 --> 02:20:16.166]  That's what people need to understand.
[02:20:16.166 --> 02:20:18.047]  This is the slave traffic, folks.
[02:20:18.047 --> 02:20:19.047]  This is modern slavery.
[02:20:19.047 --> 02:20:21.086]  We go, oh, they're here for a better life.
[02:20:21.086 --> 02:20:23.688]  No, they're being used.
[02:20:24.437 --> 02:20:35.299]  And you know, just to push back on the SJWs, because they say, oh, well, we need billions of dollars in reparations for all the black people in the United States of America because they're victims of slavery.
[02:20:35.379 --> 02:20:46.681]  And we need to make sure that we, you know, we wash the sins away of America in the past by making sure that we make it very clear that we are anti-slavery here in the United States of America.
[02:20:46.881 --> 02:20:48.521]  But they don't want to talk about this, Alex.
[02:20:48.701 --> 02:20:51.502]  You're not allowed to talk about the children that are being recycled.
[02:20:52.002 --> 02:20:52.922]  Recycled!
[02:20:53.482 --> 02:20:53.842]  All right?
[02:20:54.163 --> 02:20:55.444]  They're being recycled.
[02:20:55.964 --> 02:20:58.627]  They get pushed through the southern border, human trafficked.
[02:20:58.907 --> 02:21:00.969]  They're here by the cartels in the United States.
[02:21:01.169 --> 02:21:02.370]  They send them back.
[02:21:03.071 --> 02:21:06.413]  And then they rotate them over and over and over and over and over.
[02:21:06.634 --> 02:21:14.681]  And you want to know, the Border Patrol and the Texas DPS, these guys, man, it is really hard to have to deal with this.
[02:21:15.201 --> 02:21:18.064]  It is really hard to have to- They're all very depressed, but they're all upset.
[02:21:19.076 --> 02:21:19.576]  They're sick of it.
[02:21:19.636 --> 02:21:20.116]  They're sick of it.
[02:21:20.136 --> 02:21:20.617]  They're pissed.
[02:21:20.677 --> 02:21:38.864]  And that's why I think it was a great, and I had a conversation with this Border Patrol agent in Eagle Pass, and he wanted me to make it very clear that, you know, everyone's talking about civil war and this, you know, this conflict between Texas DPS and Border Patrol because the feds are going to have some mass conflict down there.
[02:21:39.631 --> 02:21:40.772]  And he made it very clear.
[02:21:40.792 --> 02:21:41.653]  He said, you know what, Drew?
[02:21:42.514 --> 02:21:43.335]  We're all unified.
[02:21:43.435 --> 02:21:44.235]  We're sick of this.
[02:21:44.636 --> 02:21:45.857]  We don't want this anymore.
[02:21:46.417 --> 02:21:47.939]  We hate what Biden is doing.
[02:21:48.319 --> 02:21:49.560]  We don't want to fight each other.
[02:21:50.041 --> 02:21:51.322]  All right, sir, I'll communicate that.
[02:21:51.722 --> 02:21:53.784]  Because I think people need to know that.
[02:21:53.804 --> 02:21:55.226]  That's all lies put up in the media.
[02:21:55.926 --> 02:21:57.648]  And again, people say, oh, we'll quit your job.
[02:21:58.529 --> 02:22:02.793]  Then if they quit, they'll even put pure NGOs in who'll rape the kids right there on scene.
[02:22:03.653 --> 02:22:05.155]  It's just it's very hard to deal with.
[02:22:06.385 --> 02:22:09.247]  And Alex, unfortunately, I think that's part of the operation.
[02:22:09.607 --> 02:22:11.508]  I mean, that's what Defund the Police was, correct?
[02:22:11.668 --> 02:22:12.849]  It's a regime installation.
[02:22:13.149 --> 02:22:15.010]  Get rid of all the good guys, alright?
[02:22:15.050 --> 02:22:17.732]  Get rid of anyone that has a conscience, okay?
[02:22:17.792 --> 02:22:23.456]  Put them in a position where they have to choose between defending their country or betraying their country.
[02:22:23.836 --> 02:22:27.318]   And anyone with a good conscience They're going to tap out.
[02:22:27.338 --> 02:22:28.198]  They're going to retire.
[02:22:28.278 --> 02:22:29.539]  They're not going to want to deal with it.
[02:22:29.559 --> 02:22:30.480]  They're going to walk away.
[02:22:30.780 --> 02:22:33.602]  Or they'll astound their ground and they'll become a whistleblower.
[02:22:33.642 --> 02:22:35.843]  We've seen this over and over and over again.
[02:22:35.883 --> 02:22:39.365]  But part of that operation is a regime installation.
[02:22:39.425 --> 02:22:44.468]  It's to replace good men and women that have a heart and a conscience that don't want to deal with this anymore.
[02:22:45.028 --> 02:22:46.229]  So they're pushed out.
[02:22:46.969 --> 02:22:48.850]  And the same thing is happening with the Border Patrol.
[02:22:49.050 --> 02:22:49.851]  The same thing is happening.
[02:22:50.171 --> 02:22:53.553]  Anything that the Feds could hijack in terms of law enforcement, FBI, CIA.
[02:22:53.573 --> 02:22:54.053]  Oh, the military.
[02:22:54.113 --> 02:22:58.376]  They did the poison shots and the transgender and the critical race theory.
[02:22:58.396 --> 02:23:00.657]  And they're like, oh, we have a record low recruitment.
[02:23:00.757 --> 02:23:01.618]  That's what they want.
[02:23:03.179 --> 02:23:03.759]  Absolutely.
[02:23:04.179 --> 02:23:10.903]   And I kind of noticed this in Jacumba as well, because anytime we go down there, Alex, These guys love us, man.
[02:23:11.083 --> 02:23:18.988]  You know, especially when they know who you are and they know, you know, what your intent is, is to expose this insane illegal invasion.
[02:23:19.008 --> 02:23:24.832]  I mean, there's no legal invasion, but it's just this illegal human trafficking operation.
[02:23:25.453 --> 02:23:35.916]   Anytime you go down to Texas or you go down to Arizona, and I start to have conversations with these Border Patrol agents, whether it's on camera or off camera, off record, They're always talking.
[02:23:36.256 --> 02:23:43.551]  Especially when they, you know, they Google you and like, okay, I feel safe talking to this guy because I know he's not some fake news, you know, cuck trying to spin everything.
[02:23:43.791 --> 02:23:44.773]  Like everything's okay.
[02:23:45.274 --> 02:23:46.516]  They're always willing to talk.
[02:23:47.117 --> 02:23:52.700]  And what I found interesting in California, because it's California, these Border Patrol agents did not want to talk.
[02:23:53.500 --> 02:23:55.742]  They did not want to have conversations.
[02:23:56.302 --> 02:24:00.904]  They just kept giving us this, you could tell it was like this rehearsed response.
[02:24:01.665 --> 02:24:06.447]  Oh, the illegals, they're coming in from everywhere.
[02:24:06.507 --> 02:24:07.708]  We heard this multiple times.
[02:24:08.388 --> 02:24:12.851]  And then we also had a conversation with one and he said, oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I can't talk to you guys.
[02:24:12.891 --> 02:24:14.192]  I love what you guys are doing.
[02:24:14.272 --> 02:24:21.216]  But, you know, I got to redirect you to, you know, the media comms for the Border Patrol representative.
[02:24:21.416 --> 02:24:23.778]  And, you know, no, no, no, no, no, knock on them.
[02:24:23.918 --> 02:24:29.201]  Just it's something to note, because this whole area, they got drones in the sky on the US side.
[02:24:29.301 --> 02:24:31.563]  Oh, yeah, no, it's the policy drawing them here.
[02:24:32.063 --> 02:24:36.606]  Then they make the agency become the facilitator and like the nannies for all of this.
[02:24:37.006 --> 02:24:41.329]  And then they sign all these men and women and children up with NGOs who skim money off of it.
[02:24:41.349 --> 02:24:43.011]  It's a giant money-making operation.
[02:24:43.031 --> 02:24:43.931]  It's not just about votes.
[02:24:45.032 --> 02:24:45.552]  Absolutely.
[02:24:45.632 --> 02:24:50.235]  And let me go back to this little Mexican guy that I debated.
[02:24:50.296 --> 02:24:53.278]  I want America to really pay attention to what was said there.
[02:24:53.838 --> 02:24:54.178]  Alright?
[02:24:54.198 --> 02:24:56.019]  Because you got Infowars on the ground.
[02:24:56.039 --> 02:24:57.921]  We played it earlier and we post this in post.
[02:24:57.941 --> 02:24:59.922]  We'll put the full 10-minute debate up.
[02:24:59.942 --> 02:25:01.063]  But what happened with this guy?
[02:25:01.898 --> 02:25:05.019]  I just want to comment on the statement he made.
[02:25:05.579 --> 02:25:07.099]  And America needs to take this serious.
[02:25:07.239 --> 02:25:08.779]  It doesn't matter what your politics are.
[02:25:08.799 --> 02:25:14.361]  It doesn't matter if you identify as a Democrat or Republican, a left-winger or a right-winger.
[02:25:14.381 --> 02:25:15.321]  It does not matter.
[02:25:15.341 --> 02:25:19.162]  This guy would not identify his citizenship, okay?
[02:25:19.502 --> 02:25:21.442]  And I made mine very clear as an American.
[02:25:21.502 --> 02:25:22.662]  I'm proud to be American, dude.
[02:25:22.702 --> 02:25:23.822]  You want to know my citizenship?
[02:25:23.962 --> 02:25:24.543]  Here you go.
[02:25:25.043 --> 02:25:25.843]  Didn't have an answer.
[02:25:25.863 --> 02:25:27.263]  And what does he say?
[02:25:27.563 --> 02:25:29.284]  He says, you think this is your country?
[02:25:29.304 --> 02:25:31.284]  He says, F America.
[02:25:32.068 --> 02:25:33.709]  This is a Mexican territory.
[02:25:34.229 --> 02:25:38.492]  I want people at home to really let that resonate, okay?
[02:25:38.512 --> 02:25:40.733]  Because how far does that really go?
[02:25:40.833 --> 02:25:46.436]  It goes farther beyond, and Alex, you know this, this goes way beyond what we're seeing right now, okay?
[02:25:46.496 --> 02:25:49.018]  Right now, we are watching the facilitation.
[02:25:49.418 --> 02:25:55.341]  We are watching the importation of this replacement migration, illegal human trafficking operation.
[02:25:55.361 --> 02:25:58.323]  Yeah, the UN admits they plan to break the United States up along ethnic lines.
[02:25:59.272 --> 02:26:01.092]  And wait until they activate these people.
[02:26:01.412 --> 02:26:03.273]  These people are filled with hatred.
[02:26:03.553 --> 02:26:04.653]  They hate Americans.
[02:26:05.013 --> 02:26:05.833]  They hate you.
[02:26:06.153 --> 02:26:07.733]  They know they're here to replace you.
[02:26:07.753 --> 02:26:11.494]  And guys like this, they know exactly what they're doing and why they're doing it.
[02:26:11.734 --> 02:26:16.735]  But at the same time, let me make another observation as well, Alex.
[02:26:17.135 --> 02:26:25.557]  So this guy is obviously, you know, this Mexican allegiant that thinks that, you know, the state of California is a Mexican territory.
[02:26:25.577 --> 02:26:26.077]  It's U.S.
[02:26:26.117 --> 02:26:26.497]  soil.
[02:26:26.817 --> 02:26:28.097]  What a crazy statement to make.
[02:26:28.894 --> 02:26:32.316]  But it's interesting because the majority of the illegals coming in are not Mexicans.
[02:26:33.036 --> 02:26:34.057]  They're coming from China.
[02:26:34.537 --> 02:26:37.098]  They're coming from Guatemala, Honduras.
[02:26:37.178 --> 02:26:38.379]  They're coming from Ecuador.
[02:26:38.399 --> 02:26:40.240]  They're coming from Colombia, Venezuela.
[02:26:40.540 --> 02:26:41.961]  From Afghanistan, Iraq.
[02:26:41.981 --> 02:26:43.041]  They're coming from the Middle East.
[02:26:43.061 --> 02:26:43.942]  They're coming from Ukraine.
[02:26:43.962 --> 02:26:44.962]  They're coming from Russia.
[02:26:45.643 --> 02:26:48.604]  A lot of military-aged men, specifically in this location.
[02:26:48.624 --> 02:26:53.987]  This is why I really wanted to put a flashlight on this, Alex, because California needs to see this, man.
[02:26:54.447 --> 02:27:08.729]   And the point I want to make is, This guy thinks that he, okay, as a Mexican, is reclaiming Mexican territory by importing all of these four nationals from all over the world into the United States?
[02:27:09.670 --> 02:27:13.931]  Even these NPCs, these UN globalist NPCs have no idea.
[02:27:13.971 --> 02:27:15.852]  No, he's conquering America for the globalists.
[02:27:16.681 --> 02:27:17.182]  Exactly.
[02:27:17.382 --> 02:27:19.285]  And he probably doesn't even realize that.
[02:27:19.685 --> 02:27:20.727]  You see what I'm saying, Alex?
[02:27:20.767 --> 02:27:30.720]  Because these people are just being weaponized by Satan to facilitate this evil agenda that is collapsing sovereignty of nations, which God has given us sovereignty.
[02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:32.881]   This is clear in the Well, God wants troops.
[02:27:32.921 --> 02:27:34.482]  God destroyed the Tower of Babel.
[02:27:34.522 --> 02:27:35.662]  He doesn't want unity.
[02:27:35.682 --> 02:27:36.523]  He wants choices.
[02:27:36.342 --> 02:27:42.822]   their own sovereignty. This even serves purposes for eschatology in the end times. There are
[02:27:42.822 --> 02:27:45.701]  nations, there are borderlines.
[02:27:45.701 --> 02:27:50.261]   God destroyed the Tower of Babel, he doesn't want unity, he wants choices. He wants clear,
[02:27:50.261 --> 02:27:52.342]  delineated lines.
[02:27:52.342 --> 02:27:54.742]  He doesn't want satanic unity, alright?
[02:27:54.763 --> 02:27:56.564]  Because people... No, that's what I meant.
[02:27:56.584 --> 02:27:58.165]  He knows Satan's trying to create a unity.
[02:27:58.545 --> 02:27:59.266]  I'm not correcting you.
[02:27:59.286 --> 02:28:00.006]  No, you're the pastor.
[02:28:00.046 --> 02:28:00.486]  Explain it to me.
[02:28:00.526 --> 02:28:01.567]  I get the layman term.
[02:28:02.107 --> 02:28:02.528]  It's okay.
[02:28:02.588 --> 02:28:04.749]  It's just... I think this is where people get it twisted, Alex.
[02:28:04.769 --> 02:28:07.271]  Yeah, God wants unity under God, but not under Satan.
[02:28:07.331 --> 02:28:07.751]  Explain that.
[02:28:08.692 --> 02:28:09.052]  Exactly.
[02:28:09.092 --> 02:28:18.798]  This is where people get... And I would even say this is where maybe Bible-believing Christians might even kind of get, you know, cornered and put into a corner.
[02:28:18.818 --> 02:28:19.919]  Well, let's go back to the Tower of Babel.
[02:28:19.999 --> 02:28:21.040]  Why did God not want that?
[02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:22.480]  Exactly.
[02:28:24.041 --> 02:28:24.982]  Unity is not bad.
[02:28:25.662 --> 02:28:26.682]  You see that in the church.
[02:28:27.423 --> 02:28:30.725]  Born-again Christians, we are the church, we are the born-again.
[02:28:31.605 --> 02:28:34.146]  Jesus prayed this in John chapter 17, correct?
[02:28:34.166 --> 02:28:36.888]  Like, I pray that they'd be unified, I pray that be together.
[02:28:36.928 --> 02:28:38.349]  But that's unified around what?
[02:28:38.629 --> 02:28:39.609]  It's the ideology.
[02:28:39.929 --> 02:28:41.150]  And unified around who?
[02:28:41.330 --> 02:28:41.650]  God.
[02:28:42.011 --> 02:28:47.453]   Because the word unity could get you into a place And that's what the Antichrist system is in the end times.
[02:28:47.513 --> 02:28:59.418]  It's this global, satanic, Antichrist unity that is everything in opposition, attempting to usurp the authority of Jesus Christ and prop themselves up as Savior, as Messiah.
[02:28:59.618 --> 02:29:00.799]  It's a false unity.
[02:29:01.159 --> 02:29:02.439]  And people need to be very careful.
[02:29:03.560 --> 02:29:12.025]   And listen, I can't speak on the hearts of some of these Self-proclaimed Christians or Catholics that are getting involved with these NGO operations.
[02:29:12.125 --> 02:29:18.010]  I don't know what the percentage would be of people that might actually be deceived, thinking they're actually doing the right thing.
[02:29:18.590 --> 02:29:21.592]  But this is why we need to wake those sector of people up as well.
[02:29:21.853 --> 02:29:35.203]  So explain from your research, because you're a pastor too, and I really respect you, Christ's unity that comes when Christ returns versus the Bible saying we have nations and peoples and God destroying the Tower of Babel.
[02:29:35.463 --> 02:29:36.524]  He didn't want that unity.
[02:29:37.648 --> 02:29:42.655]  Yeah, it's very simple, because the Tower of Babel, that was a satanic operation, alright?
[02:29:42.675 --> 02:29:44.857]  Because the heartbeat of Lucifer, right?
[02:29:44.897 --> 02:29:46.479]  Why was Lucifer cast out of heaven?
[02:29:46.519 --> 02:29:48.462]  Because his heart was lifted up in pride.
[02:29:48.702 --> 02:29:49.643]  He wanted to be God.
[02:29:49.683 --> 02:29:52.828]  He wanted to rise above the heavens, above the throne of God.
[02:29:53.128 --> 02:29:54.610]  He wanted God's position.
[02:29:55.370 --> 02:29:57.491]  Okay, so that is the heartbeat of Lucifer.
[02:29:57.751 --> 02:30:03.354]  And you see this throughout the Old Testament and the New Testament, where civilization attempts to do the same exact thing.
[02:30:03.374 --> 02:30:11.438]  They erect the Tower of Babel, they want to ascend into the heavens, they want to ascend above God, and it's a global unity without God.
[02:30:11.878 --> 02:30:20.666]  It's a global unity that is humanitarian within humanity that is backed spiritually by Satan, but it's void of Christ.
[02:30:20.986 --> 02:30:22.167]  It's void of the Bible.
[02:30:22.447 --> 02:30:23.909]  It's void of the Word of God.
[02:30:24.109 --> 02:30:29.073]  That's why nothing these people do and nothing they say to an extent lines up with the Bible.
[02:30:29.113 --> 02:30:31.195]   This is why The Bible is the filter.
[02:30:31.235 --> 02:30:32.677]  I don't care what anybody has to say.
[02:30:32.697 --> 02:30:34.178]  They say it in the name of God.
[02:30:34.398 --> 02:30:35.659]  They say it in the name of Christ.
[02:30:35.960 --> 02:30:39.243]  If it does not line up with the Bible, reject it.
[02:30:39.503 --> 02:30:40.364]  That's your filter.
[02:30:40.624 --> 02:30:41.525]  That's your survival.
[02:30:41.765 --> 02:30:42.566]  That's your discernment.
[02:30:42.706 --> 02:31:04.305]   So the difference between this satanic unity that you see, it's the spirit of the Antichrist that shows up in the end times, that is this global, unified, humanitarian, Kumbaya, everyone looks the same, everyone sounds the same, even the military is unified, the global economy is unified, politics, it's a global death cult in the end.
[02:31:04.806 --> 02:31:06.307]  But what are they unified around?
[02:31:07.007 --> 02:31:08.509]  Not Jesus Christ, not the Bible.
[02:31:08.529 --> 02:31:10.230]  It's whatever the mark of the beast tells you to do.
[02:31:10.590 --> 02:31:11.791]  You have to worship the beast.
[02:31:12.052 --> 02:31:16.876]  You don't just get the mark and buy and sell, you have to follow the beast, worship it, which is the social credit score.
[02:31:18.317 --> 02:31:18.877]  Absolutely.
[02:31:18.917 --> 02:31:28.584]   The mark of the beast is not only A piece of technology or a mark of the culture to receive at that time in order to participate in the economy at that time.
[02:31:28.604 --> 02:31:29.845]  That's just part of it.
[02:31:30.365 --> 02:31:33.107]  The mark of the beast at the time is an allegiant.
[02:31:33.407 --> 02:31:38.271]  Your proclamation that the Antichrist is God himself in the flesh.
[02:31:39.111 --> 02:31:41.433]  If you accept that, that's what you are proclaiming.
[02:31:41.473 --> 02:31:42.393]  You take that mark.
[02:31:42.674 --> 02:31:44.975]  But you reject that, you're gonna get killed for it.
[02:31:45.475 --> 02:31:45.736]  Why?
[02:31:45.816 --> 02:31:47.397]  Because you're rejecting him as God.
[02:31:48.097 --> 02:31:48.758]  Serious stuff, guys.
[02:31:49.520 --> 02:31:52.063]  Let's do five more minutes and then our guest does text over.
[02:31:52.463 --> 02:31:54.265]  Drew Hernandez on fire as usual.

[02:32:14.504 --> 02:32:22.511]  What it does with the vasodilation alone, not to mention the immune system, exercise performance, you name it.
[02:32:23.512 --> 02:32:24.172]  It's incredible.

[02:32:42.612 --> 02:32:43.912]  It is good versus evil.
[02:32:43.932 --> 02:32:46.193]  I've been trying to shoot a report for weeks.
[02:32:46.233 --> 02:32:48.994]  I'm going to try to shoot it today or tomorrow.
[02:32:49.014 --> 02:32:50.194]  So much is happening.
[02:32:50.113 --> 02:32:54.113]  Thank you all for your support and you need this product.
[02:32:54.113 --> 02:32:57.113]  You can see the Satanism out in the open.
[02:32:57.113 --> 02:32:59.113]  It is good versus evil.
[02:32:59.113 --> 02:33:01.113]  I've been trying to shoot a report for weeks.
[02:33:01.113 --> 02:33:03.113]  I'm going to try to shoot it today or tomorrow.
[02:33:03.113 --> 02:33:04.113]  So much is happening.
[02:33:04.113 --> 02:33:10.113]   I've done months of research on just all the open Satanism on TV, kids shows, movies.
[02:33:10.751 --> 02:33:14.134]  I mean, they're saying Satan's good, God is bad.
[02:33:14.994 --> 02:33:16.175]  And they're bringing it out.
[02:33:16.195 --> 02:33:19.358]  So the time we have left, Dreven, a great job down there on the border.
[02:33:19.398 --> 02:33:20.238]  I know you've got more coming.
[02:33:21.680 --> 02:33:24.222]  Finish up your breakdown, because you're dead on.
[02:33:24.542 --> 02:33:26.063]  Satan is a counterfeit of God.
[02:33:26.083 --> 02:33:31.988]  He has a false unity, which looks good because we're designed by God to want unity, but it's not God's unity.
[02:33:32.388 --> 02:33:33.429]  It's a destructive unity.
[02:33:35.086 --> 02:33:42.633]  And I think that's the problem with a lot of, you know, self-proclaimed Christians because they don't have a biblical foundation.
[02:33:42.934 --> 02:33:44.795]  It's quite literally that simple.
[02:33:45.276 --> 02:33:48.839]  Because how can you discern and identify what you're really unified around?
[02:33:48.899 --> 02:33:55.065]  Am I unified around some kind of satanically, demonically empowered movement?
[02:33:55.646 --> 02:34:03.585]   Am I empowered, excuse me, am I unified around some kind of A holy spirit, a biblically empowered movement by God.
[02:34:03.605 --> 02:34:08.729]  And the only way you're going to be able to tell is if the actions displayed before you, the fruits.
[02:34:08.969 --> 02:34:09.809]  It's what Christ said.
[02:34:09.870 --> 02:34:14.493]  And part of the fruits isn't just what we do, the enemy comes after you when you're going against them.
[02:34:15.626 --> 02:34:16.146]  Absolutely.
[02:34:16.186 --> 02:34:18.867]  You could see the byproduct in persecution, definitely.
[02:34:18.927 --> 02:34:24.129]  People are going to come after you for taking a stance, not only for truth, but THE truth.
[02:34:24.609 --> 02:34:26.730]  You really want to see some levels of persecution.
[02:34:26.790 --> 02:34:30.971]  Start really standing for Christ pretty much anywhere, publicly, wherever you are.
[02:34:31.012 --> 02:34:34.613]  And you've seen these levels of that, Alex, especially with InfoWars.
[02:34:35.513 --> 02:34:40.958]  Literally come after you for standing against an end time scenario, the New World Order and the globalist machine.
[02:34:41.418 --> 02:34:52.428]  But I think people need to be really careful because the Bible has made this very clear that in the last days you're going to see a total rise in deception, false messiahs, false Christ, false prophets.
[02:34:52.868 --> 02:35:00.175]  These levels of sophisticated deception are going to continue to rise in the media, in the culture, in politics, in government.
[02:35:01.455 --> 02:35:10.939]  All of these influential institutions, not only the United States, but worldwide, globally, especially with the collapse of the southern border of the United States of America.
[02:35:10.979 --> 02:35:14.641]  And I think a lot, because I've had conversations with so-called Christians.
[02:35:14.661 --> 02:35:18.883]  I'm like, yeah, but you know, the Bible does say we got to take care of the foreigner.
[02:35:18.943 --> 02:35:23.304]  The Bible does say that we should love our enemy as ourself, love your neighbor as yourself.
[02:35:24.125 --> 02:35:27.226]  But then I push back and I say, well, what does that really mean?
[02:35:27.990 --> 02:35:34.440]  Like, what if you're dealing with an operation that is totally, 100% satanically charged?
[02:35:34.460 --> 02:35:37.004]  The UN cut off their food for three years.
[02:35:37.064 --> 02:35:39.448]  They are victims, but now they're used as a weapon.
[02:35:39.869 --> 02:35:40.630]  It's part of a UN plan.
[02:35:43.246 --> 02:35:46.469]  They've been weaponized, and they're being weaponized at the same time.
[02:35:46.509 --> 02:35:48.311]  Just wait till these people get activated, Alex.
[02:35:48.371 --> 02:35:49.853]  You know, you know, I don't have to tell you.
[02:35:50.133 --> 02:35:54.217]  Just wait till these people get activated like they've been activated in France, in Germany, and in Europe.
[02:35:54.538 --> 02:35:57.120]  Then, then, Europe's five years ahead of us.
[02:35:57.501 --> 02:35:59.703]  They bring them in, then they politically activate them.
[02:36:00.720 --> 02:36:02.121]  Yeah, how's the church doing there?
[02:36:02.381 --> 02:36:06.943]  You know, it's just... They burned down 5,000 churches in France alone in the last few years.
[02:36:07.703 --> 02:36:08.284]  Exactly.
[02:36:08.624 --> 02:36:13.046]  And because once they get activated, that's when people wake up to the reality of what's going on here.
[02:36:13.406 --> 02:36:16.587]  It's not... That's why I don't like using the term border crisis, Alex.
[02:36:16.828 --> 02:36:17.408]  I don't like it.
[02:36:17.728 --> 02:36:20.849]  It sounds like... No, it's the end of America crisis.
[02:36:20.929 --> 02:36:21.950]  It's the UN invasion.
[02:36:22.884 --> 02:36:29.791]  But the term crisis just sounds like a hurricane's coming through and there's nothing we can do to control it.
[02:36:29.811 --> 02:36:30.571]  How about the border war?
[02:36:30.631 --> 02:36:31.272]  What should we call it?
[02:36:31.912 --> 02:36:32.693]  It's an invasion.
[02:36:33.074 --> 02:36:34.735]  It's a collapse of American sovereignty.
[02:36:34.775 --> 02:36:35.316]  That's what it is.
[02:36:35.476 --> 02:36:36.757]  It's a total invasion.
[02:36:36.837 --> 02:36:38.799]  Like you said, UN backed, globalist backed.
[02:36:39.443 --> 02:36:42.966]  Because to imply it's a crisis means that, like, we don't have control.
[02:36:43.006 --> 02:36:44.247]  This is strategic, Alex.
[02:36:44.268 --> 02:36:44.668]  You know this.
[02:36:44.768 --> 02:36:46.710]  All of this is pre-planned, strategic.
[02:36:46.850 --> 02:36:47.070]  U.S.
[02:36:47.110 --> 02:36:52.035]  government working with cartels and foreign globalist entities and NGOs, 501c3s, C4s.
[02:36:52.255 --> 02:36:53.376]  They get these FEMA grants.
[02:36:53.396 --> 02:36:59.822]  They get all of these government grants that are all coming in, importing to these NGOs to facilitate these people coming into our country.
[02:37:00.102 --> 02:37:00.803]  It's lawless!
[02:37:01.403 --> 02:37:07.450]  As a Christian, you can't sit here and say, well, I support that and I want to participate, you know, to help these people.
[02:37:07.570 --> 02:37:09.552]  No, these people are being used, alright?
[02:37:09.772 --> 02:37:13.876]  And a lot of them, I'm telling you, you talk to Border Patrol, they're like, the majority of these people are not family.
[02:37:13.896 --> 02:37:16.239]  Well, doesn't the Bible tell us where Satan is or is there anarchy?
[02:37:18.405 --> 02:37:19.025]  Lawlessness.
[02:37:19.305 --> 02:37:21.006]  Total anarchy and lawlessness.
[02:37:21.106 --> 02:37:24.827]  And right now, what we are watching is this mass operation.
[02:37:25.287 --> 02:37:26.508]  Anarchy, lawlessness.
[02:37:26.988 --> 02:37:28.228]  We serve a God of order.
[02:37:28.548 --> 02:37:32.370]  Bible says the God that we serve, Jesus Christ, is a God of order.
[02:37:32.710 --> 02:37:36.031]  And right now we don't have that, especially in the context of- Drew, how do people find the great reports you're posting?
[02:37:37.062 --> 02:37:45.090]  You guys can follow me on X at Drew H Live, but make sure to support Banned.Video, InfowarsStore.com so we can continue to do some on-the-ground reporting here.
[02:37:45.150 --> 02:37:45.530]  We thank you.
[02:37:45.550 --> 02:37:46.231]  Be safe, Drew.
[02:37:46.251 --> 02:37:46.691]  Great job.
[02:37:46.731 --> 02:37:47.131]  We love you.
[02:37:47.712 --> 02:37:51.395]  And we are live here in the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:37:51.536 --> 02:38:04.526]   I am Jason Bermas, and we're going to be talking about the quote-unquote well-being economy, but Something Alex talked about an hour ago totally changed up my intro.
[02:38:04.566 --> 02:38:13.492]  Because really, when we talk about this well-being economy, what he led with, and the profound fact that in a lot of ways we've lost, guys.
[02:38:13.952 --> 02:38:15.193]  We've totally lost.
[02:38:15.513 --> 02:38:19.036]  That does have to be admitted.
[02:38:19.056 --> 02:38:20.177]  And what do I mean by that?
[02:38:20.837 --> 02:38:32.750]   There was a global biological weapons attack That really occurred outside of the nation-state apparatus.
[02:38:32.810 --> 02:38:34.071]  And what do I mean by that?
[02:38:34.711 --> 02:39:02.784]   Well, when you look at the virus itself and its release, I want to emphasize that release, all the data by serious scientists say what it was in the United States in September or October, one of the worst Flu seasons ever and remember even media reports of what popcorn lung and too much vaping as young people were also being hospitalized.
[02:39:03.104 --> 02:39:04.104]  Coincidence, I know.
[02:39:04.845 --> 02:39:05.325]  But then...
[02:39:06.135 --> 02:39:19.979]  When it reached China, which I also believe was seeded there by some entity, when you look at this thing, again, you had Chinese military officials coming out and saying they believed it was the U.S.
[02:39:20.039 --> 02:39:22.280]  seeding it during the military Wuhan games.
[02:39:23.180 --> 02:39:28.122]  I'm not saying that's correct, but this was not an accidental release.
[02:39:28.182 --> 02:39:31.683]  This was a bioweapons attack on humanity.
[02:39:32.475 --> 02:39:36.378]  Well-knowing because they held their little event 201 drills.
[02:39:36.398 --> 02:39:41.181]  These people love to brag and we're going to get into that about the well-being economy.
[02:39:42.882 --> 02:39:47.385]  Where they had a coronavirus outbreak from South America.
[02:39:48.245 --> 02:39:48.685]  Okay?
[02:39:49.246 --> 02:39:54.669]  And basically, one by one, they did exactly what they said they were going to do.
[02:39:54.729 --> 02:39:57.511]  But during the drill, a lot more people died.
[02:39:58.075 --> 02:40:05.019]  There was a lot more fear, but there was this consensus and consolidation of power.
[02:40:05.959 --> 02:40:18.426]  And, you know, one of the things that I did want to highlight is, you know, now it's nomenclature, it's common knowledge that the six foot distance to slow the spread, the social distance, totally made up number.
[02:40:19.065 --> 02:40:23.926]  But you knew it was made up if you had been following this stuff for years and you saw what they did over in Singapore.
[02:40:23.946 --> 02:40:26.747]  You see, it wasn't six feet in Singapore.
[02:40:27.127 --> 02:40:28.607]  It was three feet, one meter.
[02:40:28.647 --> 02:40:29.407]  Why was that?
[02:40:29.747 --> 02:40:32.488]  Well, they had the DARPA robots roaming the streets.
[02:40:32.708 --> 02:40:39.409]  You know, Spot, the little cute robot you can get for like $35,000 to $75,000 depending on how you want it souped up.
[02:40:39.989 --> 02:40:47.411]  You know, the one that originated through military technology and the War of Terror, those big dogs, that's what it became.
[02:40:48.348 --> 02:40:54.010]  And it had facial recognition and motion recognition to make sure people were staying three feet apart.
[02:40:54.790 --> 02:40:56.250]  They had more surveillance.
[02:40:56.270 --> 02:41:11.534]  So we get attacked by a bioweapon globally, and hardcore in this country, only for them to then attack the populace again by injecting them with a multitude of bioweapons.
[02:41:12.234 --> 02:41:20.909]   Because we do have the mRNA, Remember, there's that Moderna partnership, and we'll show you that right now, all the way back in 2013.
[02:41:21.409 --> 02:41:22.530]  Okay?
[02:41:22.550 --> 02:41:25.092]  Because they love you.
[02:41:25.693 --> 02:41:29.076]  With DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency.
[02:41:29.296 --> 02:41:39.624]  So from its inception, everybody, Moderna and DARPA are part of the ADEPT and PROTECT program.
[02:41:39.644 --> 02:41:47.176]   This is a military operation that then expands to a ton of different strategic collaborators.
[02:41:47.876 --> 02:41:52.559]  AstraZeneca, oh my good, wait a minute, didn't they get to put out some of those hate and lies shots?
[02:41:52.900 --> 02:41:53.620]  Well, how about that?
[02:41:54.721 --> 02:41:58.884]  Merck, Vertex, Barta, which is the medical DARPA.
[02:41:59.464 --> 02:42:00.985]  Okay, and there's DARPA itself.
[02:42:01.205 --> 02:42:04.287]  And of course, the good people at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[02:42:04.728 --> 02:42:10.852]  Institute Pasteur is also in here, all on their own websites, all out in the public arena.
[02:42:10.892 --> 02:42:21.835]   So we got attacked by a bioweapon, We're still being attacked with different versions of their hate and live shots to this day.
[02:42:22.115 --> 02:42:25.896]  The psychological warfare has been over the top.
[02:42:27.016 --> 02:42:31.477]  And as Alex often talks about, you know, we are now inside the new world order.
[02:42:33.337 --> 02:42:48.088]   Even before he said what he did today, You know, I had kind of a moment where I thought to myself, I was getting ready to do my shows, I was thinking about what the topics were going to be with the guests they have lined up over at Making Sense of the Madness on Patriot.TV.
[02:42:48.408 --> 02:42:49.529]  That's where you can find my stuff.
[02:42:50.430 --> 02:42:53.212]  And I thought I was getting up.
[02:42:53.472 --> 02:42:56.414]  I looked in the mirror and I just for some reason, I'm like, am I doing enough?
[02:42:56.754 --> 02:42:57.615]  Have I done enough?
[02:42:58.455 --> 02:43:00.036]  You know, I know Alex is 50 now.
[02:43:00.116 --> 02:43:00.877]  I'm 44.
[02:43:01.357 --> 02:43:02.458]  I'll be 45 this year.
[02:43:02.878 --> 02:43:04.279]  And quite frankly, he's not wrong.
[02:43:04.559 --> 02:43:05.400]  I haven't done enough.
[02:43:06.727 --> 02:43:08.828]  I haven't made enough films.
[02:43:09.449 --> 02:43:12.050]  I haven't gone to enough protests.
[02:43:13.311 --> 02:43:14.972]  And he's just right about that.
[02:43:15.292 --> 02:43:16.793]  I don't know that you can do enough.
[02:43:17.233 --> 02:43:21.876]  You know, aside from, obviously you need a personal life and a social life, right?
[02:43:21.896 --> 02:43:25.138]  And the family is that strongest unit.
[02:43:25.258 --> 02:43:31.001]  There has to be a lot of, you want to create joy there in the overall family dynamic.
[02:43:31.041 --> 02:43:31.721]  That's part of it.
[02:43:32.062 --> 02:43:35.884]  There's going to be ups and downs, but you need to have attention to that, right?
[02:43:37.481 --> 02:43:47.490]  Anytime I'm just messing around or I'm partaking in something that's just a hobby at this point, it does feel kind of like I'm being selfish.
[02:43:47.631 --> 02:43:48.872]  I could absolutely do more.
[02:43:51.227 --> 02:43:54.589]  You know, I just wanted to get that out of the way in this first segment.
[02:43:55.009 --> 02:44:02.534]  I just related with that comment so much because there are still people taking this stuff and on top of it, you know, we could talk about the shedding.
[02:44:03.094 --> 02:44:04.695]  Forget about what this is.
[02:44:05.136 --> 02:44:10.199]  We could talk about the bio and geoengineering of nature all around us.
[02:44:10.939 --> 02:44:24.333]   You know, the classified and declassified programs, the government programs and the private programs, you know, that Public-private partnership we always talk about and that's why I want to get into this.
[02:44:25.133 --> 02:44:26.694]  So the well-being economy.
[02:44:26.714 --> 02:44:39.859]  I'm going to take everybody on this journey of right before the pandemic, we're going to start there, with Bill Gates talking about how profitable vaccines are.
[02:44:39.959 --> 02:44:46.043]   What Through these benevolent organizations like his Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[02:44:46.344 --> 02:44:49.248]  So we're going to hit that clip first and foremost.
[02:44:49.288 --> 02:44:49.769]  Let's do it.
[02:44:50.649 --> 02:44:51.930]  We're here today with Bill Gates.
[02:44:51.990 --> 02:44:54.252]  A lot to talk about, about what he's been working on.
[02:44:54.352 --> 02:44:55.933]  And Mr. Gates, thank you so much for being with us.
[02:44:56.774 --> 02:44:59.976]  I'd like to talk to you about your approach to vaccinations.
[02:45:00.016 --> 02:45:06.781]  You wrote something recently, and like you always do, you kind of looked at the problem from a scientific and business perspective on things.
[02:45:07.162 --> 02:45:12.946]  You've invested $10 billion in vaccinations over the last two decades, and you figured out the return on investment for that.
[02:45:12.966 --> 02:45:13.847]  It kind of stunned me.
[02:45:13.867 --> 02:45:14.867]  Can you walk us through the math?
[02:45:15.468 --> 02:45:34.241]   Well, it's pretty impressive that When you take these vaccines, get them to be very inexpensive by making big volume commitments, have that right relationship with the private sector, get the delivery system so they're really getting the coverage out there, you literally save millions of lives.
[02:45:34.922 --> 02:45:45.366]  And 20 years ago when we created these new multilateral organizations, Gavi for the vaccines, Global Fund for HIV, TB and Malaria, we didn't know they'd be successful.
[02:45:46.115 --> 02:45:51.882]  I'm just going to pause it there for a moment before you get to find out what the financial return on investment is.
[02:45:52.822 --> 02:45:54.703]  He just mentioned the Global Fund.
[02:45:54.723 --> 02:46:14.969]  We're going to be following this up with the Global Fund because if you think the number he put out here on what the profit margin making these vaccines is, wait till you hear what Joe Biden has to say after Bill Gates introduces him, by the way, at the Global Fund just a couple of years ago.
[02:46:15.029 --> 02:46:16.569]  But let's let Gates finish here.
[02:46:17.230 --> 02:46:37.888]   They've gone through lots of challenges about making sure the money gets there, making sure the Efficiency is right, but as we look at upcoming replenishments for those, and we've got so much distractions politically that the international needs like this could get eclipsed if we're not careful.
[02:46:37.908 --> 02:46:40.710]  You know, we see a phenomenal track record.
[02:46:40.850 --> 02:46:43.872]  It's been 100 billion overall that the world's put in.
[02:46:44.634 --> 02:46:51.176]  Our foundation is a bit more than 10 billion, but we feel there's been over a 20 to 1 return.
[02:46:51.396 --> 02:46:57.718]  So if you just look at the economic benefits, that's a pretty strong number compared to anything else.
[02:46:58.398 --> 02:47:00.719]  Big smile right there.
[02:47:01.179 --> 02:47:01.819]  Big smile.
[02:47:01.839 --> 02:47:03.280]  Oh, the economic 20 to 1 return.
[02:47:04.978 --> 02:47:11.620]  Oh yeah, and then it's governments, your tax dollars, that are putting in the other money.
[02:47:11.660 --> 02:47:13.801]  Who's really reaping the benefits here?
[02:47:14.081 --> 02:47:21.344]  So just at an economic level, Bill Gates is licking those lips when we come back.
[02:47:21.929 --> 02:47:26.333]  We're going to talk about a bigger economic return via that global fund.
[02:47:26.633 --> 02:47:28.234]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:28.274 --> 02:47:33.859]  Go support InfoWars.com at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[02:47:34.059 --> 02:47:36.281]  Get the books, get the supplements back after this.
[02:47:36.980 --> 02:47:37.701]  And we are back.
[02:47:37.761 --> 02:47:38.822]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:38.962 --> 02:47:43.085]  I am Jason Vermas and we were talking about the well-being economy.
[02:47:43.145 --> 02:47:57.897]  We just saw Gates salivating at the idea of taking global funds and making a 20 to 1 return by getting commitments to jab people with all sorts of hate and lies.
[02:47:58.217 --> 02:48:01.720]  That was Davos prior to the COVID 1984 nightmare.
[02:48:01.760 --> 02:48:07.040]   Let's go post COVID 1984 nightmare.
[02:48:07.060 --> 02:48:13.485]  I mean, we're still living under it, but by this time, Biden has been installed and he can barely speak.
[02:48:13.845 --> 02:48:27.395]  Now again, Alex made the point earlier, you know, you could play videos all day of Joe Biden looking confused and how terrible these people are and what a joke they are and have a fun broadcast and mainline.
[02:48:27.776 --> 02:48:29.877]  And hey, there's a time and a place for some of that.
[02:48:29.897 --> 02:48:35.042]   And we'll actually, at the very tail end, You'll revisit why you should know this video.
[02:48:35.502 --> 02:49:07.873]   But while even the alternative media mostly focused on Joe Biden going and not knowing where he was until I come down or whatever, what they didn't focus on Is this admission that the Global Fund, remember he talked about it, HIV, TB, malaria, they pose as benevolent institutions, and we're going to have a throwback of G. Edward Griffin exposing that way back in the day, all right, for what it was, and now we look at what it turned into at a 30, I think a 31 to 1 return.
[02:49:11.810 --> 02:49:19.833]  Okay, and then we're going to get into SDGs, and when I say we, Joe Biden, who can barely speak and read off a script.
[02:49:19.853 --> 02:49:24.896]  So here it is, Biden and the Global Fund after being announced by Gates himself.
[02:49:25.636 --> 02:49:30.858]  We're going to work with our partners in Congress to contribute another $6 billion to the Global Fund.
[02:49:33.359 --> 02:49:38.121]  Bringing the overall Global Pledge as of today to $14 billion.
[02:49:40.746 --> 02:49:50.009]  These incredible contributions we succeeded through our mutual and continuing commitment to deliver one of the largest fundraisers in global health history.
[02:49:50.630 --> 02:49:55.271]  And these billions are expected to deliver a 31-fold return on investment.
[02:49:55.291 --> 02:49:57.052]  31-fold return on investment.
[02:50:00.356 --> 02:50:14.220]  And in other words, for every dollar to fight these diseases, we expect $31 in health gains and economic returns, which also advances our progress toward meeting the goal of Sustainable Development Agenda.
[02:50:14.900 --> 02:50:18.201]  So, it's the Sustainable Development Agenda.
[02:50:18.481 --> 02:50:18.961]  Here we go.
[02:50:18.981 --> 02:50:29.064]  To improve surveillance capabilities, build stronger, more resilient health supply chains, and increase innovations to reach those most in need.
[02:50:29.744 --> 02:50:38.673]  And it's going to help prevent and respond to gender-based violence and advance sexual and reproductive rights and health outcomes for people around the world.
[02:50:40.228 --> 02:50:43.271]  Let me translate that one for everybody, okay?
[02:50:43.891 --> 02:50:53.980]  So first of all, they're bringing in the gender agenda, making sure they're going to get their care, because there's just so much gender-based violence.
[02:50:54.440 --> 02:50:54.961]  No, no, no.
[02:50:55.421 --> 02:51:04.028]  This is all about a full medical and social cultural takeover under the guise of charity.
[02:51:04.048 --> 02:51:09.052]   And then these people are literally untouchable We're putting equity at the core of our efforts.
[02:51:09.051 --> 02:51:10.811]  criminally after the fact.
[02:51:10.811 --> 02:51:17.531]   And if you think I'm wrong about that, why is nobody in jail based on what happened
[02:51:17.531 --> 02:51:18.810]  in the last few years?
[02:51:18.810 --> 02:51:20.390]  Ask yourself that question.
[02:51:20.390 --> 02:51:22.191]  Let's let Mr. Biden finish up here.
[02:51:22.191 --> 02:51:26.251]  We're putting equity at the core of our efforts.
[02:51:26.251 --> 02:51:30.730]   We have to ensure that everyone, no matter who they are, who they love,
[02:51:30.730 --> 02:51:35.851]   where they come from, can access care and treatment they need, period.
[02:51:35.851 --> 02:51:38.730]  (audience applauding)
[02:51:39.575 --> 02:51:40.636]  And this is the goofy part.
[02:51:40.656 --> 02:51:42.437]  This is where you're going to remember where this is from.
[02:51:43.638 --> 02:51:43.758]  Okay?
[02:51:48.180 --> 02:51:48.600]  There you go.
[02:51:48.640 --> 02:51:49.761]  I hope everybody enjoyed it.
[02:51:50.141 --> 02:51:53.263]  The stone-cold face Joe not being able to do anything.
[02:51:53.283 --> 02:51:54.523]  But think what he said right there.
[02:51:55.544 --> 02:51:55.844]  Okay?
[02:51:55.984 --> 02:51:58.005]  That this is a global takeover.
[02:51:58.245 --> 02:52:01.367]  And we talk about how these people want your children.
[02:52:01.932 --> 02:52:12.496]  But what they really want is government in every aspect of every human life and the regimentation of all human beings and really biological life in general.
[02:52:12.536 --> 02:52:17.838]  That's why carbon has been chosen, alright?
[02:52:17.878 --> 02:52:22.940]  Because we are carbon-based and so is every other biological life form.
[02:52:23.732 --> 02:52:27.575]  I want to talk about some of this public-private partnership because this is well-being.
[02:52:27.895 --> 02:52:29.737]  We want to get shots to everybody.
[02:52:29.797 --> 02:52:31.398]  Everybody's making money.
[02:52:31.418 --> 02:52:34.460]  Forget about 20 to 1.
[02:52:34.501 --> 02:52:35.061]  It's 31 to 1!
[02:52:35.201 --> 02:52:36.002]  Get in here!
[02:52:36.402 --> 02:52:38.384]  Let's further legitimize the criminals.
[02:52:39.144 --> 02:52:43.948]  Now, a lot of other people got in on the party once this got going.
[02:52:44.308 --> 02:52:47.931]  So when they were looking for a vaccine and partners, I just want to show you this clip.
[02:52:48.371 --> 02:52:48.972]  IBM!
[02:52:49.716 --> 02:52:50.477]  Got in the party.
[02:52:50.497 --> 02:52:59.050]  You know, the good people at IBM, if you want to look up a thing called IBM and the Holocaust, you might be surprised at what you find.
[02:52:59.411 --> 02:53:00.753]  But let's check out this clip right here.
[02:53:01.385 --> 02:53:10.427]  And just a note tonight, tech company IBM and Moderna, the pharmaceutical company, are joining forces in the race to speed up this vaccination process.
[02:53:10.887 --> 02:53:19.089]  The two are looking to use artificial intelligence and blockchain, that's a data storing system, to help improve vaccine distribution.
[02:53:19.169 --> 02:53:20.149]  Exciting stuff.
[02:53:20.670 --> 02:53:23.210]  Some blockchain technology too, hmm.
[02:53:23.650 --> 02:53:24.170]  How about that?
[02:53:24.190 --> 02:53:37.606]   And then I would be remiss, as you can see above me, If I did not mention that Tesla teamed up with CureVac to make the RNA microfactories to print up the shots.
[02:53:38.547 --> 02:53:39.847]  And why is that important?
[02:53:39.987 --> 02:53:44.869]  Well, again, this is about the regimentation of all life on the planet.
[02:53:44.929 --> 02:53:51.731]  And you notice Joe also mentioned during the Global Fund surveillance and surveillance capabilities.
[02:53:52.361 --> 02:54:06.999]  Well, one of the biggest surveillance slash communications capabilities that's out there right now being utilized by the military is Starlink and its DARPA partner that gets launched by SpaceX, Blackjack.
[02:54:07.552 --> 02:54:08.272]  That program.
[02:54:09.033 --> 02:54:13.894]  And here's John Kerry, ghoul of all ghouls, Mr. Climate Change Agenda.
[02:54:14.354 --> 02:54:16.175]  Mr. Humanity is the problem.
[02:54:16.195 --> 02:54:18.015]  Because again, they haven't been shy.
[02:54:18.035 --> 02:54:25.918]  And we're going to get to a clip from the Club of Rome 1973 and their first artificial intelligence, actually.
[02:54:26.298 --> 02:54:29.320]  And how we're the bad guys and the absurdity of that.
[02:54:29.640 --> 02:54:36.325]  But first, I'm going to play Kerry associating SpaceX with vaccines.
[02:54:36.385 --> 02:54:41.268]  And this is in 2022 at COP, I think it is, 27.
[02:54:41.528 --> 02:54:43.349]  Again, one of these climate change conferences.
[02:54:43.369 --> 02:54:43.910]  So here we go.
[02:54:44.610 --> 02:54:49.553]  The idea behind the launch of the First Movers Coalition is pretty straightforward.
[02:54:51.254 --> 02:54:54.857]  We needed to create demand signals in the marketplace.
[02:54:55.523 --> 02:54:56.463]  Where they didn't exist.
[02:54:57.544 --> 02:54:59.024]  Which takes boldness.
[02:55:00.204 --> 02:55:04.905]  It takes courage by these executives who have made the decisions to be part of this.
[02:55:05.666 --> 02:55:09.326]  And we modeled it somewhat on the experience of what happened with vaccines.
[02:55:09.366 --> 02:55:12.987]  The government said, you know, we'll pay for it, build it.
[02:55:14.028 --> 02:55:15.528]  And the same thing with SpaceX.
[02:55:16.708 --> 02:55:19.749]  If you build it, we're going to use it, and we'll pay for it.
[02:55:20.726 --> 02:55:33.578]  And so people who were putting capital at risk knew that they could get a return on that capital or at least cover their expenses in the case of something like vaccines where human life was so at risk.
[02:55:34.379 --> 02:55:41.025]  Where human life is at risk now in the context of the challenge of the global climate crisis.
[02:55:41.852 --> 02:55:45.134]  I mean, he even throws the climate crisis stuff in there.
[02:55:45.154 --> 02:55:46.714]  I want you to think of what he's saying right there.
[02:55:46.734 --> 02:55:52.817]  That is the public-private partnership that already exists.
[02:55:52.977 --> 02:55:56.179]  It is the very definition of fascism.
[02:55:57.379 --> 02:55:58.900]  We know someone else is going to pay for it.
[02:55:59.040 --> 02:55:59.860]  The government.
[02:56:00.320 --> 02:56:01.641]  We're going to do it.
[02:56:01.681 --> 02:56:06.602]  When we come back, we're going to bring Klaus Nutschwab into the game.
[02:56:06.662 --> 02:56:11.384]  He's going to tell you about the well-being economy and crushing the individual.
[02:56:11.404 --> 02:56:12.585]  It's all about collectivism.
[02:56:12.785 --> 02:56:14.245]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:56:14.505 --> 02:56:15.946]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:56:16.526 --> 02:56:17.266]  Media matters.
[02:56:17.727 --> 02:56:18.687]  The Democratic Party.
[02:56:19.720 --> 02:56:26.027]  MSNBC and others have asked me to apologize for making a parody video game criticizing the deep state and all the corruption.
[02:56:26.648 --> 02:56:28.530]  And to all them, I just want to say this.
[02:56:29.391 --> 02:56:30.573]  Go f*** yourselves!
[02:56:32.336 --> 02:56:38.643]  Alex Jones' New World Order Wars has been number one on Steam thanks to the viewers and listeners of this broadcast.
[02:56:38.983 --> 02:56:52.197]  And I want to invite everyone, before they are successful at banning, which I hope they aren't, to go to alexjonesgame.com and follow the link to Steam and download this game for $17.76 as a message to the New World Order.
[02:56:52.957 --> 02:56:53.358]  F*** you!
[02:56:53.918 --> 02:57:01.925]  You want to try to ban this game just like you want to steal elections and force injections on us and open up our borders and rape us.
[02:57:02.345 --> 02:57:06.309]  This is a culture war and they're scared of this game.
[02:57:06.729 --> 02:57:15.476]  Get Alex Jones' New World Order Wars right now at AlexJonesGame.com because anything badass gets censored!
[02:57:16.698 --> 02:57:17.478]  And we are back.
[02:57:17.518 --> 02:57:19.639]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:57:19.719 --> 02:57:43.483]  And before we get to this clip of Klaus Schwab talking about what the well-being economy is and how dangerous the individual is, you know, the single person and what that means, I want to talk about other words that we use a lot, whether it is globalism, OK, or global government or global governance.
[02:57:43.743 --> 02:57:45.443]  We talk about socialism.
[02:57:46.115 --> 02:57:51.399]  Alright, if we talk about communism, what are all these things at the end of the day?
[02:57:51.419 --> 02:57:53.781]  They're forms of collectivism.
[02:57:54.681 --> 02:58:04.789]  And collectivism in many ways eviscerates individual rights that are not granted by the state or those in power.
[02:58:04.829 --> 02:58:07.971]  Instead, they are granted by the creator.
[02:58:08.031 --> 02:58:20.297]   No matter what creator you may believe in, or if you believe in that creator, At all, you are inherently given these God-given rights, these freedoms we all talk about.
[02:58:20.957 --> 02:58:29.520]  And when Klaus talks about this well-being economy, they want to crush those freedoms on a level most cannot imagine.
[02:58:29.840 --> 02:58:31.681]  So this clip's not really a big one.
[02:58:31.701 --> 02:58:33.701]  A lot of people haven't put it out there.
[02:58:34.201 --> 02:58:35.442]  It's about two minutes long.
[02:58:35.802 --> 02:58:36.282]  Let's play it.
[02:58:37.421 --> 02:58:55.077]  We have the capability to create a humankind which is more socially oriented, which is more creative, maybe more artistic, which moves much more from the notion of creating material wealth to creating well-being.
[02:58:55.537 --> 02:59:00.742]  And well-being is more than just material satisfaction.
[02:59:00.782 --> 02:59:13.121]   We can create a humankind which is healthier, So let's just stop it right there, because I want to really again interpret what he just said.
[02:59:13.162 --> 02:59:16.825]  First of all, this promise of everybody living longer?
[02:59:16.664 --> 02:59:18.583]  Technology is fantastic.
[02:59:18.583 --> 02:59:20.744]  We have it in our hands.
[02:59:20.744 --> 02:59:22.664]  So let's just stop it right there.
[02:59:22.664 --> 02:59:25.943]  'Cause I wanna really again interpret what he just said.
[02:59:25.943 --> 02:59:29.503]  First of all, this promise of everybody living longer.
[02:59:29.503 --> 02:59:31.244]  Heard that one before.
[02:59:31.244 --> 02:59:33.624]  Heard that one growing up again.
[02:59:33.334 --> 02:59:37.695]  We were going to eradicate cancer by the time I was like, forget about 44.
[02:59:38.075 --> 02:59:39.876]  I'm 44 years young.
[02:59:40.036 --> 02:59:40.656]  By the time I was like 30.
[02:59:41.216 --> 02:59:42.076]  We got this.
[02:59:42.596 --> 02:59:44.377]  People are going to live to a hundred plus.
[02:59:44.677 --> 02:59:48.438]  These promises are completely and totally empty.
[02:59:48.478 --> 02:59:49.678]  And think about what he says.
[02:59:49.858 --> 02:59:52.939]  We're going to move you away from making things.
[02:59:53.839 --> 02:59:54.419]  Creating.
[02:59:55.166 --> 02:59:58.327]  Now that is a scary notion.
[02:59:58.747 --> 03:00:01.707]  Instead, it's all going to be about health and well-being.
[03:00:01.747 --> 03:00:02.468]  What does that mean?
[03:00:03.548 --> 03:00:12.830]  Look at the health and well-being they have brought us through this pharmaceutical industrial complex that worked arm-in-arm with the military industrial complex.
[03:00:13.090 --> 03:00:22.852]  Go look into what was really going on with MKUltra and academic institutions and private pharmaceutical companies.
[03:00:23.752 --> 03:00:24.112]  All right?
[03:00:24.867 --> 03:00:25.768]  That's the reality.
[03:00:25.788 --> 03:00:26.988]  So what is that well-being?
[03:00:27.689 --> 03:00:36.574]  Well, a drugged and surveilled populace through any means necessary for the collective, for a relatively healthy life.
[03:00:36.974 --> 03:00:42.277]  We're going to be concerned so much with your health, just like they were during the COVID-1984 nightmare.
[03:00:42.297 --> 03:00:47.060]  And you know, what's going to stop us from being healthy?
[03:00:47.280 --> 03:00:52.243]  And by the way, guys, I can't emphasize this enough, and it needs to be talked about more and more.
[03:00:53.909 --> 03:01:00.752]  Every time I turn on a video online and there's some kind of commercial, it is for better health now.
[03:01:01.492 --> 03:01:12.357]  They are trying so hard to sell my generation, the younger generation, on some kind of automated psychological health care online.
[03:01:14.278 --> 03:01:15.198]  That's where we're at.
[03:01:15.518 --> 03:01:17.459]  That's the kind of well-being I like to dish out.
[03:01:18.274 --> 03:01:19.395]  AI is a real thing.
[03:01:19.815 --> 03:01:21.537]  Digital people are real things.
[03:01:21.857 --> 03:01:28.262]  In the next five years, that could be commercialized to the level you think you're talking to a person, you're spilling your guts out.
[03:01:28.482 --> 03:01:29.843]  It's a hundred percent AI.
[03:01:30.663 --> 03:01:36.147]  But in order to do those things, we've got to crush individual speech and individual rights.
[03:01:36.167 --> 03:01:39.210]  Because individuals are the problem, right Klaus?
[03:01:40.491 --> 03:01:44.293]  But, social technologies have risks.
[03:01:45.454 --> 03:01:47.576]  And, there's particularly one risk.
[03:01:49.089 --> 03:01:50.430]  Individuals!
[03:01:50.450 --> 03:01:52.492]  Think, like, right?
[03:01:52.391 --> 03:01:58.391]   Those new technologies provide asymmetric power to individuals.
[03:01:58.391 --> 03:02:05.391]   So I'm not now talking in detail what it means, you all can imagine,
[03:02:05.391 --> 03:02:11.391]  but it means that individuals can do a lot of harm.
[03:02:11.391 --> 03:02:13.391]  Individuals.
[03:02:13.391 --> 03:02:17.391]  Like, right, super villains exist.
[03:02:17.391 --> 03:02:24.391]   And because super villains exist, we have to control every aspect of your life,
[03:02:24.391 --> 03:02:29.391]   and you're going to submit for your well-being in the new well-being economy.
[03:02:29.391 --> 03:02:39.391]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[03:02:30.928 --> 03:02:49.941]   So we have to make sure that we, how shall I say it, that we combat those individuals and that we shape the future in such a way that we use the potential of the new We have to be aware of the risks and we have to prepare ourselves for the risks.
[03:02:49.981 --> 03:02:51.963]  That's all what the Forum is doing.
[03:02:52.984 --> 03:03:01.015]  Just to give you a concrete... It's not only in our minds that we are doing something.
[03:03:01.035 --> 03:03:32.150]   We opened a center of It was the first Industrial Revolution in San Francisco and I will have tomorrow discussions also with the government to see how we can engage Israel to look at the technological progress but at the same time at the societal effects and to develop standards and protocols to make sure that those technologies are used for the benefit of mankind and not as destructive weapons.
[03:03:33.031 --> 03:03:34.993]  Not as destructive weapons.
[03:03:35.053 --> 03:03:36.635]  Well, let's think about what he just said.
[03:03:36.655 --> 03:03:39.858]  Because he mentioned Israel and how it could be utilized.
[03:03:40.339 --> 03:03:52.733]   Now, during COVID-1984, the Israeli people were some of the most heavily and forcibly vaccinated out there and Netanyahu Came out and said, you know what?
[03:03:53.153 --> 03:04:01.016]  We've got a 98% record of all of our citizens over the last 20 years of their medical records.
[03:04:01.516 --> 03:04:07.318]  We're also going for a genetic database of that nature.
[03:04:07.338 --> 03:04:11.919]  And now I want to remind people, they had the vaccine passports.
[03:04:11.939 --> 03:04:12.959]  You want to go to the store?
[03:04:12.979 --> 03:04:13.920]  Uh-uh-uh.
[03:04:14.260 --> 03:04:15.740]  Not without your passport.
[03:04:16.700 --> 03:04:18.381]  I mean, those were some of the votes.
[03:04:19.125 --> 03:04:27.413]  That's what's scary about that nation on top of the Palestinian situation, where you literally have, again, AI, and we're about to get into AI.
[03:04:27.693 --> 03:04:30.055]  Klaus is big on AI, right?
[03:04:31.416 --> 03:04:39.383]  When you have automated systems making decisions, and they have the sharpshooter with less lethal munitions at some of these checkpoints.
[03:04:39.643 --> 03:04:40.264]  Sharpshooter.
[03:04:40.604 --> 03:04:41.285]  Look into it.
[03:04:42.068 --> 03:04:54.671]  Quick, I got this clip of G. Edward Griffin calling these tax-exempt charitable foundations out way back in the day, and this is the guy that talks about rugged individualism.
[03:04:56.552 --> 03:05:01.313]  The story you are about to hear represents a missing piece in the puzzle of modern history.
[03:05:02.114 --> 03:05:07.255]  Without this knowledge, many contemporary events are simply beyond understanding.
[03:05:08.180 --> 03:05:18.682]  You're about to hear a man tell you that the major tax-exempt foundations of this land, since at least 1945, have been operating to promote a hidden agenda.
[03:05:19.722 --> 03:05:25.243]  And that agenda has nothing to do with the surface appearance of charity, good works, or philanthropy.
[03:05:27.264 --> 03:05:41.347]   This man will tell you that the real objectives include the creation of a worldwide collective estate, including the Soviet Union, Which is to be ruled from behind the scenes by those same interests which now control the tax-exempt foundations.
[03:05:43.468 --> 03:06:00.183]  The man who tells this story is none other than Mr. Norman Dodd, who in 1954 was the staff director of the Congressional Special Committee to Investigate Tax-Exempt Foundations, sometimes referred to as the Reese Committee, in recognition of its chairman, Congressman Carroll Reese.
[03:06:02.176 --> 03:06:05.359]  The interview you are about to see was conducted by me in 1982.
[03:06:06.960 --> 03:06:13.745]  I had no immediate use for the material at that time, but I realized that Mr. Dodd's story was of extreme importance.
[03:06:14.406 --> 03:06:22.172]  And since he was advanced in age, and not in good health, I simply wanted to capture his recollections on videotape while he was still with us.
[03:06:23.061 --> 03:06:27.725]  Now obviously we're not going to play that interview, but that's the OG right there.
[03:06:28.326 --> 03:06:30.748]  G. Edward Griffin is the man.
[03:06:31.209 --> 03:06:44.000]   The man that exposed Jekyll Island, the banking systems, the roundtable groups, the modus operandi of this collectivist It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:44.100 --> 03:06:45.420]  I am Jason Bermas.
[03:06:45.781 --> 03:06:50.083]  Please consider supporting InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:06:50.203 --> 03:06:53.866]  Going to get the supplements, the books, and more.
[03:06:53.946 --> 03:06:55.266]  Help fight the info war.
[03:06:55.286 --> 03:06:56.687]  We'll be back after this.
[03:06:57.268 --> 03:06:58.248]  And we are back.
[03:06:58.368 --> 03:07:00.270]  Final segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:07:00.350 --> 03:07:02.171]  I am Jason Bermas.
[03:07:03.041 --> 03:07:24.517]  We're going to shift gears all the way back to the Club of Rome in 1973 because the idea of Malthusianism and population control and this neo-feudal idea that, again, there's a class above us, this scumbag predator class that gets to decide everything because they know what's best.
[03:07:24.558 --> 03:07:27.260]  They're mommy and daddy and we just have to go along with it.
[03:07:27.280 --> 03:07:28.961]  It's been around for a very long time.
[03:07:29.699 --> 03:07:37.642]  But this was a rebranding through, again, the benevolent idea that pollution was bad and there were too many people on the planet.
[03:07:37.662 --> 03:07:42.904]  So even back in the day, with the Club of Rome, people were the problem.
[03:07:43.164 --> 03:07:46.885]  But don't take other people and scientists' word for it.
[03:07:47.385 --> 03:07:50.046]  Let's take a machine's word for it.
[03:07:50.707 --> 03:08:03.506]   This is where we were Shifting gears to what we are now in with AI and that hype and how we have to be obedient to it and what it's going to actually choose our leaders and our direction for us.
[03:08:04.066 --> 03:08:11.449]  The original AI, we're essentially saying 2020, that's peak civilization at best.
[03:08:11.489 --> 03:08:13.609]  Things are going to get really rotten around that time by 2040, 2050.
[03:08:15.908 --> 03:08:17.429]  All of civilization is done.
[03:08:17.489 --> 03:08:18.570]  You can't make this up.
[03:08:19.230 --> 03:08:24.414]  And it was legitimized through the idea that this machine was warning us.
[03:08:24.454 --> 03:08:26.015]  So we better clean up our act.
[03:08:26.716 --> 03:08:29.117]  Now, it was pollution and population control.
[03:08:29.177 --> 03:08:32.380]  Then it shifted over to climate change.
[03:08:32.420 --> 03:08:33.721]  And again, I got to bring it up.
[03:08:34.121 --> 03:08:35.762]  You know, the old musker do here.
[03:08:35.982 --> 03:08:37.083]  Oh, excuse me there.
[03:08:37.103 --> 03:08:42.374]   He ...has said that to solve climate change we need a carbon tax.
[03:08:42.454 --> 03:08:44.755]  I couldn't disagree more.
[03:08:44.815 --> 03:08:49.599]  A carbon tax would be really the end of us and more of that total control.
[03:08:50.019 --> 03:08:59.526]  Well, let's watch this old-school news clip on the Club of Rome and their AI, everybody, and how we're bad as human beings.
[03:09:01.988 --> 03:09:06.151]  The program called World One doesn't pretend to be a precise forecast.
[03:09:06.713 --> 03:09:11.774]  What it does for the first time in man's history on the planet is to look at the world as one system.
[03:09:12.335 --> 03:09:18.036]  It shows that Earth cannot sustain present population and industrial growth for much more than a few decades.
[03:09:18.676 --> 03:09:24.578]  It shows that simply cleaning up our car exhausts and making some small effort to limit our families simply isn't enough.
[03:09:26.458 --> 03:09:32.240]  It's like an electronic guided tour of our global behavior since 1900 and where that behavior will lead us.
[03:09:34.176 --> 03:09:38.337]  Well, this is the printed version of what we've just seen on the television screen.
[03:09:38.737 --> 03:09:52.079]  What looks at first to be just a maze of computer characteristics is really a system of very simple graphs which project what's going to happen to the planet over the next 150 years if we don't do something drastic to stop it.
[03:09:52.899 --> 03:09:56.040]  Now again, we're talking early 70s here.
[03:09:56.760 --> 03:10:03.822]   You already said in three decades, if we don't clean up our act and limit our growth, our family, Everybody needs to look in the limits of growth.
[03:10:04.122 --> 03:10:05.763]  It's all over!
[03:10:05.783 --> 03:10:07.084]  We're done!
[03:10:07.104 --> 03:10:08.565]  Ah!
[03:10:08.625 --> 03:10:10.046]  The sky is falling!
[03:10:10.106 --> 03:10:12.788]  The academics and the computer have told us so.
[03:10:13.288 --> 03:10:14.149]  But let them continue.
[03:10:17.322 --> 03:10:20.463]  Down the left-hand side of the graph is the date 1900, 1940, 1980, 2020, right down to 2060.
[03:10:20.322 --> 03:10:25.842]  1900, 1940, 1980, 2020, right down to 2060.
[03:10:25.842 --> 03:10:33.322]   Now, each of these lines of letters represents a curve showing some aspect of the condition
[03:10:33.322 --> 03:10:34.822]  of the planet.
[03:10:34.822 --> 03:10:38.762]   The further out this way they go, the greater that figure is.
[03:10:38.941 --> 03:10:41.002]  The further this way, the less.
[03:10:41.343 --> 03:10:43.644]  For example, P represents population.
[03:10:43.804 --> 03:10:48.167]  So here it is at 1900, and then it comes up to 1940, it starts to take off.
[03:10:48.627 --> 03:10:53.671]  Here we are at 1980, up to the turn of the century, and then it starts to peter off.
[03:10:54.733 --> 03:10:59.036]  Let's now have a look at this next curve, the Q curve, which is the quality of life.
[03:10:59.076 --> 03:11:07.123]  And this is represented by, for example, the amount of space people have, the amount of money they have to spend, the amount of food they have to eat.
[03:11:08.304 --> 03:11:15.730]  Now, it increases rapidly up to 1940, but from 1940 on, the quality of life diminishes.
[03:11:16.330 --> 03:11:22.155]  And here we are about the turn of the century, and we come up to the year 2020, and it's really come right back.
[03:11:24.962 --> 03:11:28.684]  2020, you know, our standard of living, yikes.
[03:11:29.445 --> 03:11:35.729]  But really during the Trump administration, especially in this country, the standard of living was at a very high point.
[03:11:35.749 --> 03:11:36.930]  It was actually coming back.
[03:11:37.597 --> 03:11:55.546]  But you see, that overall downgrade, that's very real, but that's real because of post-World War II consolidation of power and globalization through groups like this, really the military-industrial complex and beyond that we were warned about via Eisenhower.
[03:11:55.826 --> 03:12:02.990]  Let's let them go for just a little bit longer, and then I've got this clip from Sin City I really want to play.
[03:12:03.690 --> 03:12:08.630]   People, of course, memes that you Start to chew up your supply of natural resources.
[03:12:08.970 --> 03:12:20.632]  And this is this curve here, the N-curve, that shows that slowly but steadily, the pool of natural wealth in the world, natural resources, minerals, oil and so on, is slowly but steadily diminishing.
[03:12:21.252 --> 03:12:22.472]  So this is the situation.
[03:12:22.792 --> 03:12:28.754]  As population increases, the quality of life decreases, and the supply of natural resources decreases.
[03:12:29.334 --> 03:12:30.554]  But have a look at this curve here.
[03:12:31.314 --> 03:12:34.155]  This is called the Z-curve, and it represents pollution.
[03:12:35.365 --> 03:12:41.389]  Now, predictably enough, as the population increases up to 1980, pollution increases.
[03:12:42.009 --> 03:12:42.750]  There's more rubbish.
[03:12:43.470 --> 03:12:47.593]  But from 1980 to the year 2020, pollution really takes off.
[03:12:47.933 --> 03:12:50.114]  This is assuming, of course, that we don't do anything about it.
[03:12:50.595 --> 03:12:55.738]  So the year 2020, the condition of the planet starts to become highly critical.
[03:12:56.078 --> 03:12:58.760]  And if we don't do anything about it, this is what's going to happen.
[03:12:59.500 --> 03:13:03.543]  The quality of life is going to go right back to practically zero.
[03:13:04.699 --> 03:13:10.424]  Pollution is going to become so serious, right out here, that it will start to kill people.
[03:13:11.585 --> 03:13:13.347]  So the population will diminish.
[03:13:15.129 --> 03:13:17.551]  Right back here, less than it was in the year 1900.
[03:13:18.332 --> 03:13:27.060]  So this idea, again, we're killing the planet, and then we're going to die, if we don't do something, has been around for a very long time.
[03:13:27.680 --> 03:13:29.442]  This clip right here that we're about to play.
[03:13:30.280 --> 03:13:45.009]  Is from Sin City, and I actually did a whole video on its parallel to Joe Biden and his son, because this is a scene in Sin City telling you how the big lie, a big lie like that one actually works and the power you get from it.
[03:13:45.369 --> 03:13:52.433]  And this is after Bruce Willis has caught a pedophile who happens to be what?
[03:13:52.974 --> 03:13:56.476]  The son of a powerful mayor of Sin City.
[03:13:57.364 --> 03:14:00.505]  Okay, and I'm just gonna let it play from there.
[03:14:01.066 --> 03:14:09.149]  You know, there's a little coarse language, no F-bombs or S-bombs, anything like that, but we've got to watch this start to finish and I'll close out the show.
[03:14:11.350 --> 03:14:20.574]  Evening, officer.
[03:14:22.835 --> 03:14:24.936]  I don't have to introduce myself, do I?
[03:14:26.167 --> 03:14:27.148]  You read the papers?
[03:14:27.868 --> 03:14:30.449]  It's been an election year, you've seen plenty of my picture.
[03:14:31.470 --> 03:14:33.591]  You know who I am, what I can do.
[03:14:35.191 --> 03:14:36.472]  I'm doing you hard again.
[03:14:37.973 --> 03:14:39.754]  Cold and hard, I'm doing you.
[03:14:40.874 --> 03:14:42.195]  You blew my son's ear off.
[03:14:44.556 --> 03:14:49.038]  Blew his arm off, you even blew his nuts and his pecker off.
[03:14:51.800 --> 03:14:54.561]  He's in a coma right now, they say he may never come out of it.
[03:14:55.746 --> 03:14:56.567]  My boy.
[03:14:56.587 --> 03:15:04.153]  He could have been the first one to become the President of the United States, but you went and turned him into a brain-damaged, dickless freak.
[03:15:05.214 --> 03:15:09.377]  Pulling that trigger make you feel powerful.
[03:15:09.417 --> 03:15:12.680]  Power don't come from a badge or a gun.
[03:15:14.441 --> 03:15:15.942]  Power comes from lying.
[03:15:17.263 --> 03:15:20.366]  Lying big and getting the whole damn world to play along with you.
[03:15:22.148 --> 03:15:26.812]  Once you got everybody agreeing with what they know in their hearts, ain't sure you got them by the balls.
[03:15:27.793 --> 03:15:31.396]  There's what, maybe... 500 people in this hospital.
[03:15:33.838 --> 03:15:38.902]  I could pump you full of bullets right now, and I wouldn't even be arrested.
[03:15:39.922 --> 03:15:41.264]  Everyone would lie for me.
[03:15:41.724 --> 03:15:42.625]  Everyone who counts.
[03:15:43.105 --> 03:15:44.346]  Otherwise, all their own lies.
[03:15:44.206 --> 03:15:48.206]   everything that runs in the city it all comes tumbling down like a pack of cards
[03:15:48.206 --> 03:16:02.439]   but i want you firm and fit healthy I'm even putting up cash of my own to get you more surgery to fix that heart condition of yours.
[03:16:03.200 --> 03:16:07.183]  You're gonna keep on living a long time.
[03:16:07.203 --> 03:16:08.163]  I'm gonna make sure of that.
[03:16:10.244 --> 03:16:15.364]   You're gonna be convicted of raping that little brat and shooting my boy.
[03:16:15.364 --> 03:16:22.404]   And you're gonna spend the rest of your life in prison, disgraced, destroyed, alone.
[03:16:22.404 --> 03:16:31.123]   Your wife, you tell her the truth and she's dead. Tell anybody the truth and they're dead.
[03:16:31.123 --> 03:16:37.844]   And those are really the type of people that they put in power.
[03:16:38.051 --> 03:16:39.753]  Think about what that guy just said.
[03:16:42.126 --> 03:16:44.848]  You know, that movie's incredible.
[03:16:45.388 --> 03:16:48.370]  The comic book graphic novel series is even better.
[03:16:48.430 --> 03:16:50.532]  I can't recommend them enough.
[03:16:50.572 --> 03:16:53.114]  I want to let everybody know I'm a documentary filmmaker.
[03:16:53.454 --> 03:16:56.076]  All of my documentary films are free.
[03:16:56.136 --> 03:16:59.138]  Invisible Empire, A New World Order to Find, Shade the Motion Picture.
[03:16:59.358 --> 03:17:00.739]  They're the big picture films.
[03:17:01.039 --> 03:17:05.762]  Then Loose Change Final Cut, Fabled Enemies, They'll Tell You the Truth, About 9-11.
[03:17:06.282 --> 03:17:11.566]  You can support InfoWars.com by going to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:17:11.966 --> 03:17:17.765]   getting the supplements, getting the t-shirts, getting the books, but supplement the truth
[03:17:17.765 --> 03:17:19.006]  by getting that out.
[03:17:19.006 --> 03:17:22.405]  Share the links, share the information.
[03:17:22.405 --> 03:17:23.405]  Don't look to others.
[03:17:23.405 --> 03:17:24.845]  You gotta be your own hero.
[03:17:24.845 --> 03:17:25.966]  Guys, it's not about left or right.
[03:17:25.966 --> 03:17:27.166]  It's always about right and wrong.
[03:17:27.166 --> 03:17:30.286]   I absolutely love you guys, and I'll see you on the flip side.
[03:17:30.286 --> 03:17:36.126]   All I do is research, research trends, and I see what is having the best effects,
[03:17:36.126 --> 03:17:38.005]  what is having the best reviews.
[03:17:38.005 --> 03:17:41.765]   So a couple years ago, I saw different formulas out there
[03:17:41.765 --> 03:17:47.045]   that are known to create compounds in the blood that flush out the body
[03:17:47.045 --> 03:17:52.005]   and that create what they call vasodilation, opening up the arteries, opening up the veins,
[03:17:52.005 --> 03:17:55.925]   which is so important, not just for young people, but especially older people.
[03:17:55.925 --> 03:17:59.966]   And so then I had Dr. Judy Mickiewicz, who's such a renowned scientist and a whistleblower,
[03:17:59.980 --> 03:18:01.121]  She said, I love your formula.
[03:18:01.141 --> 03:18:02.021]  It's one of the best out there.
[03:18:02.581 --> 03:18:05.482]  And so this product, Nitric Boost, became a bestseller.
[03:18:05.962 --> 03:18:09.544]  Well, we decided to soup it up and make it even stronger.
[03:18:10.224 --> 03:18:12.385]  So it's the original formula, just a little bit stronger.
[03:18:12.965 --> 03:18:16.846]  Now Nitric Boost is available at InfoWardStore.com.
[03:18:17.266 --> 03:18:20.827]   Because the problem was, the supplier we had, Couldn't supply enough.
[03:18:21.167 --> 03:18:22.568]  We were selling out very, very quickly.
[03:18:22.608 --> 03:18:28.769]  But now we've got a big supply of Nitric Boost in stock, ready to ship at mfowarstore.com.
[03:18:29.129 --> 03:18:38.472]  And when I talk about vasodilation and the nitric oxide is a potent vasco-dilator, then it can help relax and widen blood vessels.
[03:18:38.832 --> 03:18:43.573]  This can lead to increased blood flow and improve circulation, which is critical to various body functions.
[03:18:44.073 --> 03:18:46.054]  So, ladies and gentlemen, it funds the MFOWAR.
[03:18:46.594 --> 03:18:47.855]  It's an amazing product.
[03:18:48.195 --> 03:18:58.361]  So we have the new and improved, super powerful Nitric Boost back in stock, ready to ship for 40% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:18:58.681 --> 03:18:59.682]  This is a true win-win.
[03:19:00.082 --> 03:19:05.085]  This has the very same effect as some of the male enhancement things out there, but totally naturally.
[03:19:05.545 --> 03:19:10.068]  This does it in a natural way, and not that I need those products, but I've tried them.
[03:19:10.088 --> 03:19:10.928]  I've been to the doctor.
[03:19:11.208 --> 03:19:15.371]  They give you a prescription of it, and I've tried the top brands, the two top brands.
[03:19:16.251 --> 03:19:18.072]  And I'm not even trying to say that's what this is.
[03:19:18.413 --> 03:19:19.253]  That's off-label.
[03:19:19.293 --> 03:19:20.454]  That's not what this is even for.
[03:19:20.774 --> 03:19:21.595]  This is a supplement.
[03:19:21.995 --> 03:19:25.557]  But it is incredible what it does for your body.
[03:19:25.877 --> 03:19:30.214]   So get This amazing product now, in stock, ready to ship.

[03:19:35.237 --> 03:19:36.498]  You fund the InfoWar.
[03:19:36.758 --> 03:19:37.879]  It's so good for your body.
[03:19:38.319 --> 03:19:39.139]  Get it while you can.
[03:19:39.640 --> 03:19:41.481]  Well, nitric oxide is a key.
[03:19:41.541 --> 03:19:43.582]  It's made by our own bodies again.
[03:19:44.002 --> 03:19:48.165]  It's made by L-citrulline and L-arginine, the amino acids.
[03:19:48.525 --> 03:19:49.426]  So we're fed.
[03:19:49.826 --> 03:19:51.808]  You can get it from beet powder and other things.
[03:19:51.908 --> 03:19:56.511]  The nitric oxide relaxes the endothelium, the vasculature.
[03:19:56.571 --> 03:19:57.712]  It relaxes the vein.
[03:19:58.032 --> 03:19:59.814]  It's a natural blood pressure.
[03:19:59.854 --> 03:20:01.335]  In fact, I use the two.
[03:20:01.455 --> 03:20:03.977]  Your Info Wars, I keep that on my shelf.
[03:20:04.337 --> 03:20:08.520]  And I feed myself the Cardio Miracle, which is straight food.
[03:20:08.880 --> 03:20:10.762]  It's a different formulation than that one.
[03:20:10.782 --> 03:20:13.224]  And the two together are a one-two punch.
[03:20:13.264 --> 03:20:17.647]  So you get in your food the ability to make what you need and no more.
[03:20:17.827 --> 03:20:18.868]  You've looked at our formula.
[03:20:18.908 --> 03:20:19.369]  You like it?
[03:20:20.470 --> 03:20:21.291]  I did, and I do.
[03:20:21.611 --> 03:20:21.872]  Yes.
[03:20:22.913 --> 03:20:24.054]  I'm not a scientist like you.
[03:20:24.074 --> 03:20:26.437]  What do these compounds do, creating nitrous oxide?
[03:20:26.457 --> 03:20:27.038]  What does it do?
[03:20:27.538 --> 03:20:32.144]  It relaxes the vasculature, so the clot will go through and not restrict.
[03:20:32.504 --> 03:20:34.066]  It allows it to relax.
[03:20:34.146 --> 03:20:42.709]   It lowers the blood pressure, has the toxic synthetic lipid nanoparticles similar to the one in the
[03:20:42.709 --> 03:20:47.450]   COVID shot. We saw athletes dropping dead on the field, passing out, falling
[03:20:47.450 --> 03:20:48.629]  down, all the things.
[03:20:48.629 --> 03:20:53.150]   Why is it particularly the athletes? They're operating at such a high level
[03:20:53.150 --> 03:20:58.909]   in their mitochondria. This is an energy production, oxygen necessary disease.
[03:20:58.909 --> 03:21:03.790]  Because athletes are running, they're constricted.
[03:21:01.792 --> 03:21:14.661]  They're working so that the blood flows and it doesn't flow, which is why your nitric oxide product, that new product, I hope you'll show it because that's a very important thing to have for acute events.
[03:21:14.741 --> 03:21:21.185]  It does all, under the tongue, give you an instant relaxing of your endothelium, your vasculature.
[03:21:21.245 --> 03:21:26.369]  So get Nitric Boost today at infowarestore.com for 40% off.
[03:21:26.769 --> 03:21:27.470]  Get it while you can.
