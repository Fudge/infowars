[00:00:01.765 --> 00:00:08.228]  In 2008, something unbelievable happened for us in the FBI.
[00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:16.271]  We were getting lots of rumors about this high-level asset that worked for several intelligence agencies at the same time.
[00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:18.591]  He worked for the Saudi Intelligence Service.
[00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:20.932]  He worked for the CIA.
[00:00:21.172 --> 00:00:25.974]  And he was being developed as a political asset in Chicago, Illinois.
[00:00:26.514 --> 00:00:28.215]  He was not even a United States citizen.
[00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:30.396]  But it was said that he was a student visa.
[00:00:31.454 --> 00:00:34.395]  And that he was a national from another country.
[00:00:34.956 --> 00:00:39.498]  In 2008, everyone in the intelligence structure found out who he was.
[00:00:40.238 --> 00:00:42.879]  It was this individual who became president in 2008.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.181]  Of the United States!
[00:00:45.641 --> 00:00:53.945]  When they ran him for president, the cabal, basically, this was the culmination of so many of their plans for so many years.
[00:00:54.645 --> 00:00:58.467]  His mission was to destroy the United States from within.
[00:00:59.127 --> 00:01:00.948]  One institution at a time.
[00:01:01.148 --> 00:01:02.189]  They spied on my campaign, Leslie.
[00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:04.110]  There's no real evidence of that.
[00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.730]  Of course there is.
[00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.751]  It's all over the place.
[00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:09.072]  Leslie, they spied on my campaign and they got caught.
[00:01:09.092 --> 00:01:10.093]  Sir, can I say something?
[00:01:10.773 --> 00:01:12.114]  You know, this is 60 Minutes.
[00:01:13.277 --> 00:01:15.819]  And we can't put on things we can't verify.
[00:01:15.839 --> 00:01:17.540]  You won't put it on because it's bad for Biden.
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.681]  We can't put on things we can't verify.
[00:01:19.721 --> 00:01:21.642]  Leslie, they spied on my campaign.
[00:01:21.662 --> 00:01:22.623]  Well, we can't verify that.
[00:01:22.643 --> 00:01:23.563]  It's been totally verified.
[00:01:23.603 --> 00:01:23.843]  No.
[00:01:24.424 --> 00:01:34.089]   GCHQ has probably the most invasive Network Intercept Program anywhere in the world.
[00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.470]  And it's the world's first full take, they call it.
[00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.672]  And that means content in addition to metadata on everything.
[00:01:41.052 --> 00:01:58.238]  Top Secret 2016 United Kingdom Government Communications Headquarters document signed off by GCHQ Director Robert Hennigan under the umbrella of New World Order Loon Boris Johnson details an operation known as Project Fulsome.
[00:01:58.578 --> 00:02:10.606]   Boldly stating, one, 28th of August, 2016, GCHQ CSO filed for permission to execute Project Fulsome at the request of the U.S.
[00:02:10.846 --> 00:02:19.772]  President, Barack Obama, seeking intelligence gathering into the Trump Organization and Donald J. Trump for President, Incorporated.
[00:02:20.052 --> 00:02:22.814]  Activities include foreign and U.S.
[00:02:23.094 --> 00:02:29.939]  domestic signals collection in regards to communications with Russian hostile actors.
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:44.530]  Two, IOCCO approved fulsome on 15th of September 2016, allowing 90 days of initial signet gathering with the potential for renewal should the situation allow.
[00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:58.220]  3.
[00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:58.220]  Since Folsom's start, a clear pattern of actionable leads have accrued, both from the Trump campaign itself, from former MI5 agent Michael Steele, and from others.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.220]  4.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.940]  U.S.
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:09.488]  National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice has requested that we continue our surveillance during the transition period, as internal U.S.
[00:03:09.568 --> 00:03:12.410]   intelligence is potentially compromised The U.S.
[00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.191]  intelligence community asked foreign spy agencies to surveil 26 associates of Donald Trump in the run-up to the 2016 election.
[00:03:17.211 --> 00:03:21.231]   The U.K.' is still in question. However, General Flynn has referenced
[00:03:21.231 --> 00:03:23.871]  the document several times for years.
[00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:29.871]   The US intelligence community asked foreign spy agencies to surveil 26 associates of Donald Trump
[00:03:29.871 --> 00:03:34.910]   in the run-up to the 2016 election. The UK's Government Communication Headquarters,
[00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.070]   which is an intelligence gathering apparatus, also known as GCHQ, was making contacts with
[00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.151]   Trump's associates as early as March of 2016, according to the report.
[00:03:45.404 --> 00:03:49.268]  A GCHQ spokesman denied the report, calling it nonsense.
[00:03:49.728 --> 00:04:00.039]  The journalists say that intelligence related to the surveillance effort is housed in a 10-inch binder, which Trump, near the end of his presidency, ordered to be declassified.
[00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:09.284]  But obviously, if this binder contains what we have been told that it contains, which may include raw intelligence, information showing that the U.S.
[00:04:09.344 --> 00:04:11.945]  government, the CIA and the intelligence community of the U.S.
[00:04:11.965 --> 00:04:18.826]   government, initiated the Russia collusion hoax, that it did not occur in the way that the official story in
[00:04:18.826 --> 00:04:23.466]   the Durham investigation had portrayed it, then that's extremely serious information.
[00:04:23.466 --> 00:04:29.306]   And it may be if the FBI then went to go get it in order to continue the cover-up of this information,
[00:04:29.306 --> 00:04:32.266]  that obviously adds an even more dramatic wrinkle to this.
[00:04:32.266 --> 00:04:40.106]   Barack Obama, hell-bent on maintaining his executive power, in league with global intelligence agencies,
[00:04:40.106 --> 00:04:47.466]   conspired to commit treason on a scale that makes Watergate look like a caveman having a picnic.
[00:04:47.596 --> 00:04:49.035]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:04:49.035 --> 00:04:51.035]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening...
[00:04:51.035 --> 00:04:54.795]   Alright folks, that's an important report on what's currently coming out of this document,
[00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:58.235]  but they all bragged that they were doing this before.
[00:04:58.235 --> 00:05:05.355]  [outro music]
[00:05:05.355 --> 00:05:07.196]  It's Sunday, February 8th.
[00:05:07.157 --> 00:05:14.340]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we are live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.281]  260 days, 7 hours, 53 minutes, 34 seconds out.
[00:05:19.022 --> 00:05:21.243]  The most important election in world history.
[00:05:21.983 --> 00:05:24.244]  A referendum against globalism.
[00:05:28.125 --> 00:05:28.466]  All right.
[00:05:29.666 --> 00:05:32.707]  People are really waking up now.
[00:05:33.247 --> 00:05:34.168]  I see it on the street.
[00:05:35.746 --> 00:05:36.746]  I see it at the gym.
[00:05:37.646 --> 00:05:39.487]  I see it at church, the grocery store.
[00:05:41.547 --> 00:05:46.908]  I went to a little local gym today and it's a pretty good sized gym.
[00:05:46.948 --> 00:05:49.349]  There were only like three people in it, all men.
[00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:55.150]  And two of the three, separately, they were all there working on a loan.
[00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.931]  Two of the three, while I was there for an hour, came over to me and said, what was done to you in the courts was wrong.
[00:06:02.472 --> 00:06:04.632]  And we all know the corrupts are completely controlled.
[00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:06.790]  And what are you going to do?
[00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.271]  And I said, what are you going to do?
[00:06:09.852 --> 00:06:10.432]  Think about that.
[00:06:10.692 --> 00:06:12.133]  I'm at a gym for an hour.
[00:06:12.153 --> 00:06:15.515]  There's only three other men in there, and two of them are listeners.
[00:06:16.636 --> 00:06:17.616]  One Hispanic, one white.
[00:06:19.277 --> 00:06:25.721]  And my point is, that's what I'm getting every time I go to the grocery store, every time I go out to eat.
[00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:32.405]  Yesterday for lunch, I took my middle and youngest daughter out to eat.
[00:06:33.746 --> 00:06:50.415]  And we went to a very popular family-owned Italian place, and I've been there many times, never had the owner come out and bring me a piece of chocolate cake and my daughter's ice cream, and say, we're all rooting for you, we know what's happened to you is wrong, and we know they're coming for us next.
[00:06:51.816 --> 00:06:56.619]  That's an old Italian family that's had restaurants in Houston and Austin for 70 years.
[00:06:57.899 --> 00:07:00.761]  And I don't start the show to say, oh look, I'm popular, I'm cool.
[00:07:02.216 --> 00:07:04.158]  Most of you aren't public figures, which is great.
[00:07:04.178 --> 00:07:04.938]  You have your privacy.
[00:07:05.579 --> 00:07:09.441]  I am a public figure, so I'm like a metric or a gauge, a sensor.
[00:07:10.602 --> 00:07:15.546]  And in a year and a half, I've been confronted on the street twice.
[00:07:16.446 --> 00:07:18.548]  And I've shook thousands of hands.
[00:07:19.188 --> 00:07:23.692]  Brown hands and white hands and brown hands, black hands.
[00:07:23.812 --> 00:07:25.353]  I mean, just everybody.
[00:07:26.413 --> 00:07:28.115]  So the globalists have screwed the pooch.
[00:07:29.356 --> 00:07:37.811]   And people know what they're doing and These weaponized court cases against Trump, a whole bunch of them don't even have juries.
[00:07:39.072 --> 00:07:40.192]  And you say, how do they do that?
[00:07:41.253 --> 00:07:44.794]  Well, tonight I want to explain this to people.
[00:07:44.854 --> 00:07:54.538]  And look, I know most of you already know about this, but unless you've been on the inside of it being eaten, inside the belly of it, you really don't get that perspective.
[00:07:55.979 --> 00:08:09.860]   So, attorney and popular talk show host, We'll be joining us, Viva Frye, coming up at the bottom of the hour to talk about the New York-Ingraham fiasco.
[00:08:11.582 --> 00:08:18.267]  And also New York, just a few weeks ago, the second defamation trial for Trump saying he was innocent.
[00:08:19.788 --> 00:08:23.531]  State law, federal law, all state, you can say you're innocent, it's not defamation.
[00:08:24.111 --> 00:08:25.432]  But they don't care.
[00:08:25.452 --> 00:08:27.274]  And I want to explain how this works.
[00:08:28.578 --> 00:08:45.670]  Because George Soros, as a CIA operative, that's what he is, he's the front man for it, didn't just take over several thousand cities and counties where they have the judges and they have the district attorneys, the county attorneys in their pockets, and now many of the police chiefs.
[00:08:49.112 --> 00:09:05.456]   They have these junkets that are on record Where they pay for the hotels and airline tickets to the Caribbean and to the Mediterranean and to Europe and to Canada and to beautiful places in Florida.
[00:09:06.837 --> 00:09:08.018]  Golf courses, you name it.
[00:09:08.459 --> 00:09:10.560]  We're talking five-star hotels, four seasons.
[00:09:12.222 --> 00:09:12.682]  The Ritz.
[00:09:16.625 --> 00:09:19.808]  And they get lavish steak dinners, everything paid for.
[00:09:20.368 --> 00:09:27.625]   And they go to these week-long conferences That are put on by George Soros organization and sub organizations.
[00:09:28.185 --> 00:09:29.826]  So you'll see like seven or eight of these groups.
[00:09:29.886 --> 00:09:32.407]  You'll see Fannie Willis going to three of them a year.
[00:09:32.447 --> 00:09:36.849]  And when you look at the groups, all three are either purely Soros or partially Soros.
[00:09:36.909 --> 00:09:40.251]  And they teach them how to engage in criminal activity.
[00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:45.273]  So they're organized crime, racketeering, mafia meetings of the lawyers.
[00:09:47.094 --> 00:09:48.895]  So they've put in a lot of the judges.
[00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:54.153]  They've had him appointed, or in areas where you run for office, like Texas, they've had him run.
[00:09:55.834 --> 00:10:00.557]  And they've got the lawyers, they've got the judges, they've got the PR firms.
[00:10:00.777 --> 00:10:01.838]  So they give them a packet.
[00:10:01.878 --> 00:10:03.900]  They say, this is how it works for lawyers.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.201]  They say, we're going to sue Alex Jones, we're going to sue Trump.
[00:10:07.622 --> 00:10:09.544]  And this has come out from whistleblowers.
[00:10:10.244 --> 00:10:11.505]  And then they're given a packet.
[00:10:11.545 --> 00:10:13.667]  This is what you say, this is what you file, this is how you do it.
[00:10:14.247 --> 00:10:16.088]  And the judge is going to default Trump.
[00:10:16.148 --> 00:10:17.349]  They're going to default Giuliani.
[00:10:17.849 --> 00:10:19.431]  They're going to default Jones.
[00:10:20.533 --> 00:10:24.774]   and say that you don't get a trial, the judge will then find you guilty,
[00:10:24.774 --> 00:10:28.014]   and then we'll have a show trial, because the public still expects one,
[00:10:28.014 --> 00:10:32.854]   on quote damages. Now, when that worked on me and a bunch of other people in the last five years,
[00:10:32.854 --> 00:10:39.494]   they've now said screw that, we're just going to have judges say you don't get a jury
[00:10:39.494 --> 00:10:42.933]   trial, and then say you're guilty on day one of the trial,
[00:10:42.933 --> 00:10:46.774]   and then have their own trial, where you don't get closing statements,
[00:10:46.774 --> 00:10:49.614]   you don't get to put forward your evidence, you don't get to say you're innocent.
[00:10:49.571 --> 00:11:05.410]   Remember what came out a few weeks ago in closing arguments, Trump got so mad and walked out and the judge gave them a list in both the So called groping rape case that never was, in my opinion, with no evidence.
[00:11:07.251 --> 00:11:13.874]  And in the real estate fraud case, where on Friday the judge said, yeah, I find you guilty 400 million bucks.
[00:11:14.234 --> 00:11:15.375]  380 million plus 20 something million.
[00:11:15.395 --> 00:11:16.215]  So it's over 400 million.
[00:11:16.235 --> 00:11:18.276]  And you got to pay it in a month, by the way.
[00:11:19.116 --> 00:11:19.797]  Oh, where's the appeal?
[00:11:20.097 --> 00:11:21.377]  They say, well, you don't get those now.
[00:11:22.278 --> 00:11:22.618]  Like what?
[00:11:24.735 --> 00:11:52.404]  Doesn't matter what the law says, they do whatever they want because, folks, they own now almost all of the appeals courts and the Supreme Courts of the states, and they are clearly blackmailing the Supreme Court justices, both Democrat and Republican, because all of them have taken trips and special favors and things that are kind of gray, but if it's a Republican, they're going to fry them.
[00:11:53.137 --> 00:12:00.240]  That's a big shot across the bow of them coming after Clarence Thomas for flying with friends and rich people, you know, a few trips a year.
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:05.602]  That's, on a scale of corruption, that's like, let's say the scales of 1 to 100.
[00:12:05.642 --> 00:12:07.603]  Clarence Thomas is about a 2.
[00:12:08.203 --> 00:12:11.484]  I mean, he did what was legal, but still they can misrepresent it.
[00:12:11.804 --> 00:12:12.244]  So he's about a 2.
[00:12:13.405 --> 00:12:16.046]  And the Democrat judges are a 150 on a scale of 100.
[00:12:16.346 --> 00:12:18.327]  I mean, they're like breaking the needle.
[00:12:19.395 --> 00:12:19.996]  Off the charts.
[00:12:20.056 --> 00:12:31.045]  It's like if a car has a RPM gauge and it says 8,000 RPMs, well, I mean, people like this Judge Ingeron are at 20,000 RPMs of corruption.
[00:12:31.085 --> 00:12:34.988]  I mean, it's cartoon level.
[00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:38.491]  So you wonder why the deep state's so arrogant.
[00:12:38.511 --> 00:12:43.856]  They don't just have the CIA and the different agencies illegally working against the American people.
[00:12:45.717 --> 00:12:47.179]  They have the courts.
[00:12:48.743 --> 00:12:55.526]  Almost completely taken over and weaponized because even the judges that aren't the payroll, federal or state, they're scared.
[00:12:56.887 --> 00:13:06.092]  Because the feds and other groups will come after them for a crooked toenail if they don't do exactly what they're told.
[00:13:06.632 --> 00:13:18.138]  So they tell the judges, hey, you can date the head of a law firm that you're finding cases for in the bankruptcy court.
[00:13:19.587 --> 00:13:22.669]  And the Southern District here in Texas, that's come out.
[00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:29.032]  And then as soon as the judge doesn't do exactly what special interests want, they bring it out.
[00:13:30.333 --> 00:13:37.677]  So what you got is a bunch of lawyers, a bunch of followers who will do whatever they're told.
[00:13:38.897 --> 00:13:40.198]  And that's the baseline.
[00:13:41.078 --> 00:13:59.262]   Then you've got the people and the prosecutors like Letitia James, the Attorney General, In New York and Judge Ingeron in New York and the other judge in New York on both of the quote Trump defamation trials are saying, I never met that woman.
[00:13:59.522 --> 00:14:00.202]  There's no witnesses.
[00:14:00.262 --> 00:14:02.404]  You can't even say what month that happened.
[00:14:02.424 --> 00:14:02.944]  25 years ago.
[00:14:03.004 --> 00:14:03.684]  That's ridiculous.
[00:14:04.045 --> 00:14:04.445]  Boom!
[00:14:04.945 --> 00:14:05.746]  Five million dollars.
[00:14:06.566 --> 00:14:07.507]  Says he's innocent again.
[00:14:08.327 --> 00:14:09.308]  Eighty plus million dollars.
[00:14:10.529 --> 00:14:15.792]  That judge covered up, look it up, all of the Epstein cases were given to him.
[00:14:17.955 --> 00:14:22.637]  So, they've put their people in place, and you have to understand that.
[00:14:22.697 --> 00:14:26.558]  And so, it's basically the CIA, but they do it through think tanks.
[00:14:27.559 --> 00:14:35.782]  They come, and they've got people that go to these meetings months out of the year, at these lavish hotels, lavish resorts.
[00:14:37.323 --> 00:14:40.464]  They come to them and they say, okay, here is your packet.
[00:14:41.147 --> 00:14:46.347]   of information and here's what we're telling you you need to do and will the media be on your side
[00:14:46.347 --> 00:14:52.107]   everything will be controlled and we've already got the Supreme Court in the state ready to go
[00:14:52.107 --> 00:14:59.866]   so you're going to be fully backed but here's what you do and then they do it.
[00:14:59.866 --> 00:15:06.427]  So we're talking about the scum of the earth okay.
[00:15:06.645 --> 00:15:16.394]  But they wear the little black robes, and they get up there, and that's why it's so famously in Austin, Texas, and in Connecticut, they're like, you called the judge a tyrant.
[00:15:16.555 --> 00:15:17.015]  Yes, I did.
[00:15:20.899 --> 00:15:22.260]  Well, you call other people tyrants.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.782]  Yes, only when they act like it.
[00:15:25.413 --> 00:15:45.541]  I mean, this is all 101, and they've got this facade up, I'm in a robe, everyone pulls my chair out, everyone kisses my ass, and they're just a corrupt lawyer who's already committed so many acts for the system that anytime they want, they can have the FBI come after him or arrest him.
[00:15:48.061 --> 00:15:54.524]  So the baseline is a bunch of cowards that'll follow orders, but now you're seeing the thoroughbreds of trash.
[00:15:55.991 --> 00:16:05.031]   the Fannie Willis's and the Lewis Kaplan's and all the rest of them, the prosecutors, the judges,
[00:16:05.031 --> 00:16:13.991]   who think you're so stupid that Trump doesn't even get a jury
[00:16:13.991 --> 00:16:22.791]  on a case with 400 million dollars.
[00:16:23.061 --> 00:16:26.704]  Again, almost all these billionaires don't have $100 million on their own.
[00:16:27.124 --> 00:16:29.146]  Oh, they'll say they're worth $5 billion, $10 million.
[00:16:29.266 --> 00:16:33.369]  Like Trump, that's all what his real estate's worth if he sold it all, but it's all leveraged.
[00:16:34.009 --> 00:16:42.215]  Almost all of that is, I mean, if Elon Musk tried to pull together $10 million in cash, he'd have a lot of trouble doing it.
[00:16:43.256 --> 00:16:44.357]  It's all invested.
[00:16:44.397 --> 00:16:46.259]  It's all tied into infrastructure.
[00:16:47.339 --> 00:16:51.300]   So Trump Doesn't have that money laying around.
[00:16:52.121 --> 00:16:57.906]  He's already spent hundreds and hundreds of millions defending himself the last few years from these thousands of lawsuits.
[00:16:59.247 --> 00:17:02.489]  And they're just moving forward against him.
[00:17:04.471 --> 00:17:10.475]  And as Trump has said a hundred times, and I'll say it again, they're not trying to get me or Trump, they're trying to get through us to get to you.
[00:17:11.216 --> 00:17:14.358]  So people always ask me, how are you handling all these attacks?
[00:17:14.398 --> 00:17:16.020]  How are you handling everything's rigged?
[00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:29.035]  And I look at you and I say, do you understand that they're cutting off our energy, they're cutting off our fertilizer, they're imploding our borders, they're destroying our currency, they're bringing this country down.
[00:17:30.016 --> 00:17:42.441]  So, I mourn that and I worry about that, and I'm very concerned and very sad about that, but I realize I'm going down on the Titanic with all of you.
[00:17:44.407 --> 00:18:07.632]  And I'm not saying this audience is like this, but for the general public, it is the inherent laziness and inherent selfishness and the belief that people are islands under themselves and are very insular that you try to warn somebody about something, you try to tell them about something, the general public, they think you're a freaking weirdo, okay?
[00:18:10.412 --> 00:18:13.953]  I mean, here's an example I've seen thousands of times or more.
[00:18:17.637 --> 00:18:22.839]  You'll talk about, hey, the globalists are gutting this company and it's going to crash the stock.
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.700]  I don't own stock in that, why do I care?
[00:18:25.341 --> 00:18:26.921]  Because it affects everything else.
[00:18:28.342 --> 00:18:32.384]  Or I don't care if they're shutting down Dutch farmers or Sri Lankan farmers, I'm not one of them.
[00:18:33.925 --> 00:18:36.886]  As if it's a moral superiority that you don't care.
[00:18:37.546 --> 00:18:41.008]  The globalists are going to do it to you, and it has ripple effects.
[00:18:42.793 --> 00:18:47.398]  The same globalists ran the same policies worldwide of lockdowns and poison injections.
[00:18:48.399 --> 00:18:50.161]  It's a planetary attack.
[00:18:50.821 --> 00:19:07.574]   Hypothetically as an analogy, if a big alien spaceship showed up 500,000 miles above the earth and launched a thousand Missiles at, say, South Africa randomly or Mexico City.
[00:19:08.195 --> 00:19:10.438]  You'll be like, oh, they just blew up Mexico City.
[00:19:11.158 --> 00:19:11.899]  Why do I care?
[00:19:12.019 --> 00:19:12.981]  Aliens just attacked.
[00:19:13.021 --> 00:19:21.671]  No, you'd go, whoa, they just blew up Mexico City or they just blew up Durban, South Africa, or they just blew up Paris, France or New York City.
[00:19:22.572 --> 00:19:23.753]  They're coming for me next.
[00:19:24.113 --> 00:19:26.034]  That's called empathy.
[00:19:26.374 --> 00:19:28.975]  And we have empathy, not because we're wimps, people.
[00:19:29.615 --> 00:19:36.398]  It's because when you see something terrible happening to somebody, you instinctively know that could be you next.
[00:19:38.779 --> 00:19:41.941]  So it's been said many times, and I'll say it again, that we've seen the meme.
[00:19:42.621 --> 00:19:44.022]  Hard times make strong men.
[00:19:44.082 --> 00:19:45.482]  Strong men make good times.
[00:19:45.542 --> 00:19:47.123]  Good times make weak men.
[00:19:48.991 --> 00:19:59.404]  And when you look at Fannie Willis and her dad up there, about the racism and the persecution against black people and all this, they're hiding behind that.
[00:19:59.824 --> 00:20:02.348]  They don't care about the persecution of black people.
[00:20:03.442 --> 00:20:11.307]  They're crooks going after a popular president that tried to fix the country and bring us better jobs and lower prices, and who the establishment's after.
[00:20:11.668 --> 00:20:28.779]  They're waging war against the voters' right to vote for who they want, trying to put him in jail for decades, and then she gets up there and says, I'm not going to answer questions about my boyfriend that I illegally gave $700,000 to, who he laundered the money back to me, because you're not going to emasculate a black man.
[00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:39.953]   And CNN and AP ran the headline, Black leaders see an attack on them and an attack on Fannie Willis.
[00:20:40.013 --> 00:20:41.194]  What the hell does that have to do with it?
[00:20:41.795 --> 00:20:49.462]  But that's why Soros puts black women in charge of most of these prosecutions, thinking they can then hide behind it.
[00:20:49.482 --> 00:20:51.764]  I don't look at that and say, look at this black woman.
[00:20:52.204 --> 00:20:53.486]  I say, look at this evil crook.
[00:20:54.406 --> 00:20:58.210]  Just like when I look at Ingerod, I don't say, look at an old white guy.
[00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:00.272]  I say, look at that disgusting crook.
[00:21:03.291 --> 00:21:07.393]  I don't look at the judge that covered up the Epstein trial, that ran the trials against Trump.
[00:21:09.834 --> 00:21:11.395]  I think, look at that old white man.
[00:21:11.916 --> 00:21:13.256]  I don't think old white men are bad.
[00:21:13.716 --> 00:21:14.457]  That's another crook!
[00:21:18.339 --> 00:21:21.200]  So, the crooks think they're above the law.
[00:21:23.201 --> 00:21:26.963]  And, here's an example, okay?
[00:21:27.884 --> 00:21:29.845]  Travis County, they have elected judges.
[00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:39.683]  And I've had all sorts of court cases in there, and they used to have old-fashioned judges, most of them were women, and they would sit there and go over the facts and be incredibly fair.
[00:21:40.323 --> 00:21:47.387]  And the word came in about five years ago, none of you are getting financed for running for office, and they all retired.
[00:21:47.847 --> 00:21:50.588]  Every judge retired in the last three years.
[00:21:51.208 --> 00:21:58.492]  And now every judge, 34 of them, every judge in Travis County, Austin, Texas, is a woman.
[00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:06.336]  And every one of them has pledged allegiance to Soros and is financed by the Democratic Party.
[00:22:06.356 --> 00:22:12.902]  And they have no pretense of justice.
[00:22:12.942 --> 00:22:14.223]  They think it's funny.
[00:22:16.065 --> 00:22:21.270]  And even the mainline Democrat lawyers are freaking out because I talk to them and they say, man, it's a circus.
[00:22:23.086 --> 00:22:26.470]  They don't even read filings, they just hackle and laugh.
[00:22:27.752 --> 00:22:30.455]  Because folks, it's a formula.
[00:22:31.697 --> 00:22:40.929]  And you go to the judges' Facebooks, and it's them with anti-fa outfits on, saying we're going to get Trump, we're going to get the white men, and it's mainly white women.
[00:22:42.586 --> 00:22:44.126]  You understand, it's a cult, folks.
[00:22:44.466 --> 00:22:59.009]  They went to law school, they got recruited into these groups, they got sent to junkets in law school so they could, so Soros' people and the CIA could kind of handle the fruit, you know, handle the stuff in the vegetable department.
[00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:01.970]  They are vegetables, culturally, mentally, spiritually.
[00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:05.011]  And then who are they going to basically finance and put in?
[00:23:05.511 --> 00:23:08.251]  And now, it's full-on war.
[00:23:08.271 --> 00:23:10.852]  Alright?
[00:23:12.663 --> 00:23:14.764]  Absolute full-on war.
[00:23:15.164 --> 00:23:16.005]  Let me tell you something.
[00:23:16.705 --> 00:23:27.971]  If they had the laws on the books to execute you for saying the sky was blue or denying man-made global warming, I guarantee you these judges would order you executed in a New York second.
[00:23:29.397 --> 00:23:31.539]  There's nothing they won't do.
[00:23:31.939 --> 00:23:42.567]  So when you look at the judges, male and female, going after Trump, and you go, man, they just look like demons, and they laugh, and they cackle, and there's no juries, and how do you do that?
[00:23:42.727 --> 00:23:47.650]  You've got to understand, people, it's like the Nazi Party getting in in Germany.
[00:23:48.551 --> 00:23:55.656]  And just once Hitler got his people in all the positions, or once the communists take over a country, and once they put the people in the positions, it's over.
[00:23:57.915 --> 00:24:00.697]  And they're going to take everything you've got.
[00:24:00.997 --> 00:24:03.058]  They're going to take your children and cut their genitals off.
[00:24:03.378 --> 00:24:04.159]  It's happening everywhere.
[00:24:04.899 --> 00:24:06.200]  They're going to devalue your currency.
[00:24:06.981 --> 00:24:10.923]  They're going to defund the police and then hire private security on taxpayer money for them.
[00:24:11.724 --> 00:24:26.393]  Because they are literally the scum of the earth, stupid, low IQ, chosen as the weapon, the knife, to be drawn across the neck of this country.
[00:24:29.474 --> 00:24:32.696]  I've been in court cases and things and you name it since I was young.
[00:24:34.077 --> 00:24:39.661]  And whether it was Dallas or wherever it was, the judges were deliberative and did a good job.
[00:24:43.583 --> 00:25:00.557]   I had Democrat judges, three different ones, give me custody of my children because they did the research and had assessments done and had me jump through a bunch of hoops and they said, well, we don't like your politics, but you're You're the guy to keep your kids.
[00:25:03.698 --> 00:25:06.359]  Ladies and gentlemen, not these new judges.
[00:25:06.379 --> 00:25:15.382]  You have to understand, these people do not care about anything.
[00:25:15.702 --> 00:25:19.604]  They have no morals, no nothing.
[00:25:20.004 --> 00:25:21.184]  They will do anything.
[00:25:21.224 --> 00:25:23.345]  They have been hired because they're stupid.
[00:25:24.284 --> 00:25:30.166]  And they're arrogant, and they're corrupt, and they will follow any order they're given.
[00:25:30.426 --> 00:25:31.907]  They're not judges.
[00:25:32.287 --> 00:25:33.768]  They're not district attorneys.
[00:25:34.348 --> 00:25:35.768]  They're not attorney generals.
[00:25:35.848 --> 00:25:58.761]   They are globalist, New World Order operatives who follow direct orders from Brennan and Soros and Obama and the globalists, and they go to the mafia meetings And they get given their marching orders, and then suddenly they become fabulously rich, and their bank accounts fill up with money, and you say, how can they do it?
[00:25:59.242 --> 00:26:02.845]  Because Merrick Garland is one of them.
[00:26:03.445 --> 00:26:14.975]  And Merrick Garland, for decades, since he didn't get the Supreme Court job, has helped organize these events for Soros around the country and around the world, where they created the army of crooks.
[00:26:16.087 --> 00:26:23.474]  They've had, on average, over a hundred meetings with these DAs, with these Attorney Generals.
[00:26:24.354 --> 00:26:26.276]  They have had meal after meal.
[00:26:26.496 --> 00:26:29.359]  They have sat around and laughed about their criminal takeover.
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.801]  This is their takeover.
[00:26:32.202 --> 00:26:33.703]  This is their assault.
[00:26:35.525 --> 00:26:40.309]  And the few pockets of judiciary that still do their jobs are being hunted.
[00:26:42.392 --> 00:26:48.854]  Soros didn't spend billions of dollars of CIA taxpayer money he was given to just open the borders and flood the country.
[00:26:49.774 --> 00:27:09.379]  Soros has spent billions, and he's just one of the big ones, there's a bunch of groups, to literally create this, where people shoot up federal courthouses, firebomb it, shoot people driving in pickup trucks because they're white, and they let them out of jail the next day, and the vice president bailed them out when she was the candidate.
[00:27:10.828 --> 00:27:15.970]  The people that shot federal courthouses were bailed out by the Vice President.
[00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:17.971]  They're revolutionaries.
[00:27:20.472 --> 00:27:21.332]  You understand that?
[00:27:22.193 --> 00:27:24.113]  They are evil criminals.
[00:27:25.754 --> 00:27:27.375]  And they're coming for you and your family.
[00:27:29.916 --> 00:27:32.697]  Viva Fries coming up to talk about it with us straight ahead.
[00:27:32.717 --> 00:27:35.658]  And I got so much other big news on Disease X and more.
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:45.761]  Alright, I'm going to cover judicial tyranny for another 30 minutes with our special guest attorney, popular talk show host Viva Frye.
[00:27:45.781 --> 00:27:57.464]  And then I'm going to get into the UN saying if you don't give us the world pandemic free to run your life and your body, disease X is imminent and it's going to kill you.
[00:27:57.504 --> 00:28:00.845]  And then I've got all this other huge news.
[00:28:00.865 --> 00:28:05.566]  80% of Americans test positive for chemical that sterilizes you and bends your genders.
[00:28:05.586 --> 00:28:08.607]  It's in Quaker Oats, Cheerios, and hundreds of other products.
[00:28:09.775 --> 00:28:10.976]  Told you this a long time ago.
[00:28:10.996 --> 00:28:12.597]  It's being done by design.
[00:28:12.617 --> 00:28:13.898]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[00:28:14.738 --> 00:28:31.629]  So they're banning carbon dioxide that plants breathe, but allowing chemicals that literally bend the genders of every animal from ants to honeybees to mammals to amphibians to birds.
[00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:34.191]  Any ornithologist can tell you this.
[00:28:34.291 --> 00:28:35.732]  We're going to be going over that next hour.
[00:28:36.969 --> 00:28:45.713]  Also, I posted a video of slavery going on in Central Africa, and it got like 5 million views today.
[00:28:46.313 --> 00:28:51.095]  Put it up last night, and I saw some people saying, slavery isn't happening in Africa.
[00:28:51.115 --> 00:28:57.738]  So I got a bunch of clips and news articles admitting that there are millions in slavery, over 10 million estimated in Africa right now.
[00:28:58.758 --> 00:29:05.344]  I know that doesn't fit the narrative that America is the home of slavery, but I thought I would actually explain some of that coming up next hour as well.
[00:29:05.845 --> 00:29:06.825]  We've got so much to cover.
[00:29:06.865 --> 00:29:12.290]  It's also all come out that Obama indeed was using intelligence agencies to spy and go after Trump.
[00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:12.971]  We already knew that.
[00:29:13.011 --> 00:29:13.872]  They already bragged about it.
[00:29:14.212 --> 00:29:15.894]  Brennan had press conferences admitting it.
[00:29:16.614 --> 00:29:20.197]  Chuckie Schumer went on TV and said that intelligence agencies are going to come after this guy.
[00:29:21.178 --> 00:29:23.961]  Mudd at the CIA said we're going to kill this guy.
[00:29:25.586 --> 00:29:39.790]  So, that's all coming up next hour, but I wanted to get Viva Frye on, from vivabarneslaw.levels.com, on ex-Viva Frye, because he's been doing an excellent job, and he's been going into great depth on it, okay?
[00:29:40.171 --> 00:29:43.171]  Explaining how this is so tyrannical, and the weaponization of the judiciary.
[00:29:43.532 --> 00:30:02.890]   I just spent 30 minutes before he came on explaining how big think tanks and organizations that Soros and others run, and the Justice Department, and Merrick Garland and others have been part of bringing these lawyers to these junkets and then sign them up and run them for office or get them installed.
[00:30:03.631 --> 00:30:05.812]  And then that's the same weaponization everywhere.
[00:30:05.873 --> 00:30:12.878]  So just a year and a half ago, everybody saw me defaulted in cases in weaponized jurisdictions of Connecticut and Austin, Texas.
[00:30:13.199 --> 00:30:14.240]  And Austin's as bad as D.C.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.000]  or New York now.
[00:30:15.401 --> 00:30:16.281]  People say, why do I live here?
[00:30:16.562 --> 00:30:18.803]  That's where I'm from, but I am going to move from here soon.
[00:30:19.104 --> 00:30:20.185]  I must leave this jurisdiction.
[00:30:20.745 --> 00:30:23.366]  It's like living right next to the Tower of Mordor under Sauron.
[00:30:25.047 --> 00:30:29.429]  But at least there, they had a show trial on damages to confuse the public.
[00:30:29.929 --> 00:30:33.671]  With Trump now, they're not even doing that, dispensing with juries.
[00:30:34.671 --> 00:30:40.474]  And or they have the famous Epstein judge that covered things up, saying you're not allowed to say you're innocent, not allowed to defend yourself.
[00:30:42.375 --> 00:30:45.237]  So Trump gets held liable for $5 million for saying he's innocent.
[00:30:45.557 --> 00:30:46.677]  The new trial, $80 million.
[00:30:47.078 --> 00:30:53.181]  So I wanted to explain, from a Canadian lawyer's perspective, but it's basically all the same, how big this is.
[00:30:53.221 --> 00:30:55.643]  Because this is why the system's so confident.
[00:30:55.943 --> 00:30:58.184]  They don't just have the intelligence agencies and the Justice Department.
[00:30:58.684 --> 00:31:03.347]  All their minions now, like Fannie Willis, can openly money launder, do all of this.
[00:31:03.407 --> 00:31:04.748]  It all comes out they've lied.
[00:31:05.921 --> 00:31:08.921]  and committed all these crimes, but they're above the law.
[00:31:08.921 --> 00:31:11.000]  So what then historically comes out of that?
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.881]   So in the limited time we have, Viva, just recap some of these latest cases.
[00:31:15.881 --> 00:31:18.000]  I see it causing a mass awakening.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.240]  I get mobbed now at the gym or the grocery store or church.
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.480]  People are bringing this to me.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.240]  They're really upset.
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:28.480]   Everywhere I go, people are bringing this up, just the general public.
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:35.240]   So people are finally getting that, wow, in many jurisdictions, the courts are as phony
[00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:41.771]  But I'd like you to quantify this and then talk about where you think this is going and how you think we should counter it.
[00:31:43.211 --> 00:31:45.332]  Quantify it.
[00:31:45.372 --> 00:31:56.294]  $450 million for Trump in New York because there's $98 million in pre-judgment interest that Justice Engeron or Judge Engeron slapped on to the $355 million.
[00:31:58.161 --> 00:31:59.162]  It's impossible to quantify.
[00:31:59.242 --> 00:32:01.043]  It's absurdly in your face.
[00:32:01.123 --> 00:32:07.307]  The only question is going to be whether or not the higher courts, Court of Appeals, Supreme Court, are going to step in and rein in the insanity.
[00:32:07.327 --> 00:32:10.669]  Like, I think I must have mentioned it a lot when I was on your show.
[00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:16.913]  You wonder how tens of millions of people starved under Stalinism, under communism, under socialism.
[00:32:17.614 --> 00:32:18.855]  You're seeing it right now.
[00:32:18.875 --> 00:32:24.458]  I hyperbolically, you know, call New York a communist state, California commie-borna.
[00:32:24.779 --> 00:32:26.740]  You got Canada, which we call commie-Canada.
[00:32:27.561 --> 00:32:34.646]  This is basically government entities usurping private assets through crook or hook, whichever way you want to go about it.
[00:32:35.006 --> 00:32:48.375]  You get this judge, Engeron, Leticia James, who campaigned off prosecuting a private citizen, a specific citizen, campaigned off of it, gets the Soros money and gets in there and then does it.
[00:32:48.635 --> 00:32:54.538]  And you get an Engeron-type corrupt judge, judicially corrupt, who says, yeah, I've got the tools to make this happen.
[00:32:55.119 --> 00:32:56.700]  Summary judgment fraud.
[00:32:57.535 --> 00:32:58.655]  On the Mar-a-Lago property.
[00:32:58.936 --> 00:33:04.417]  And now you have a six-week show trial because guilt is already established by way of summary judgments.
[00:33:04.757 --> 00:33:05.958]  And it was only a question of how much.
[00:33:06.438 --> 00:33:12.840]  And the judge came out with something that's just, you know, it's left the likes of Michael Cohen, you know, licking their lips, it's so juicy.
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:20.443]  And it's left anybody with half a brain flabbergasted that you have the government basically saying, we're going to try to put private enterprise out of business.
[00:33:20.463 --> 00:33:24.284]  Forget the others, thousands of people who work for Trump, the Trump or whatever.
[00:33:24.344 --> 00:33:29.145]   And let's explain, the banks all said, And tried to testify, but the judge wouldn't let him.
[00:33:29.185 --> 00:33:30.887]  And Trump couldn't even do closing arguments.
[00:33:30.907 --> 00:33:33.590]  He was given a whole list of things he couldn't say in all these show trials.
[00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:35.573]  It's a judge, not a jury.
[00:33:36.073 --> 00:33:38.836]  But Trump came to say he's innocent, but the bank said no.
[00:33:39.277 --> 00:33:40.959]  All of Trump's investments paid off.
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:44.183]  All the properties actually went up in value more than he projected.
[00:33:45.521 --> 00:33:46.742]  Alex, it's worse than that.
[00:33:47.563 --> 00:33:54.230]  And it was Ivanka who came and started the testimony, and it was whoever the rep was from the Deutsche Bank came and said, he didn't defraud us.
[00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:55.971]  We were competing for his business.
[00:33:56.012 --> 00:33:56.732]  He was a whale.
[00:33:56.972 --> 00:33:58.214]  We wanted his business.
[00:33:58.514 --> 00:34:00.916]  He didn't lie to us to get preferential interest rates.
[00:34:01.117 --> 00:34:03.799]  We were giving him preferential interest rates because we wanted his business.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:06.122]  It paid us tens of millions of dollars.
[00:34:06.342 --> 00:34:09.405]  He paid us back in full, and it was good business for everybody.
[00:34:09.805 --> 00:34:11.226]  It's not just a victimless crime.
[00:34:11.607 --> 00:34:13.088]  There is no fraud here.
[00:34:13.348 --> 00:34:15.029]  It's fabricated out of whole cloth.
[00:34:15.490 --> 00:34:23.156]  And, you know, this evidence that was adduced after guilt or liability, because it was a civil case, was already found by way of summary judgment.
[00:34:23.556 --> 00:34:26.618]  People are watching this saying, how the hell is this even going on?
[00:34:26.879 --> 00:34:29.200]  But the liability was already found.
[00:34:29.541 --> 00:34:37.407]   And so you just have this show trial where even there, when they're controlling the evidence that's being adduced, everybody watching it is like, This is ridiculous.
[00:34:37.447 --> 00:34:39.088]  This is preposterous.
[00:34:39.128 --> 00:34:42.069]  Remember what happened in my Texas and Connecticut show trial?
[00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:45.512]  People were against me at the first and they kept saying, when does he get to talk?
[00:34:45.832 --> 00:34:46.792]  When do his lawyers get to talk?
[00:34:46.852 --> 00:34:49.394]  Many days, the judges would say, you don't get to talk.
[00:34:50.014 --> 00:34:53.336]  And they would just get up there and say, he came and he peed on the grave.
[00:34:53.436 --> 00:34:54.577]  No video, no witnesses.
[00:34:54.937 --> 00:34:58.179]  He's got $400 million he got from us and never had $5 million.
[00:34:58.479 --> 00:35:00.881]  I mean, they literally just made up anything they wanted to.
[00:35:01.141 --> 00:35:04.243]  And people saw that, so they turned off the YouTube comments.
[00:35:04.283 --> 00:35:04.703]  Remember that?
[00:35:06.389 --> 00:35:23.778]  First of all, I remember that, and those who are not yet awake sat there and said, oh, Alex Jones had a trial, and I have to sit there and explain to them that what you just saw of a trial was not a trial on the merits, that was a trial after the default verdict based on purported non-compliance with discovery obligations, all a load of crap.
[00:35:24.018 --> 00:35:29.461]  But people, those who are not awake, were tricked, duped into thinking they saw a trial, when they didn't, even.
[00:35:30.281 --> 00:35:40.685]  Those who were paying attention knew that this is an absolute joke from the get-go, and as they're watching this show trial on the damages only, basically what we saw in New York, they're like, how is he even found liable in the first place?
[00:35:41.125 --> 00:35:43.026]  Oh, in your case, default verdict.
[00:35:43.326 --> 00:35:52.750]  In Trump's case, a summary judgment from a judge who's on record on camera saying, I've got the tools to yield the results that I want, you know.
[00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:57.353]  Remember, he talked to a group of law students, what, three years ago, and he said, I can do whatever I want.
[00:35:57.393 --> 00:35:58.834]  I'm in charge.
[00:35:58.854 --> 00:35:59.615]  I don't have to follow the law.
[00:35:59.995 --> 00:36:01.276]  And that's the thing, though.
[00:36:01.936 --> 00:36:05.198]  But here's what I want to ask you, because you're a big popular talk show.
[00:36:05.238 --> 00:36:05.959]  I see a lot of feedback.
[00:36:06.139 --> 00:36:07.920]  I'm seeing people finally get this.
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:13.824]  It usually takes time, but people are finally, people couldn't really wrap their mind around, why does his lawyers talk?
[00:36:14.344 --> 00:36:15.745]  Why doesn't he ever get to defend?
[00:36:16.686 --> 00:36:21.009]  People still thought we were in a free country, but I think now the veil is lifting.
[00:36:22.313 --> 00:36:23.314]  Well, I think so as well.
[00:36:23.374 --> 00:36:27.817]  I was watching the, you know, I spent two days live streaming the Fannie Willis evidentiary hearing.
[00:36:28.357 --> 00:36:36.182]  And, you know, even MSM, I'll call them propagandist hacks of the MSM, they're out there saying, yeah, it's 50-50 that she gets disqualified.
[00:36:36.623 --> 00:36:40.105]  And that's in their protective propagandist perspective.
[00:36:40.145 --> 00:36:47.230]  They have to now admit it's so patented in your face that it's equally likely that Fannie Willis gets disqualified from this case.
[00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:51.973]  People are waking up to the fact that this is, it's socially society destructing.
[00:36:53.154 --> 00:37:03.400]  Even if you're a blue, I don't know what the word is in American, but like a blue-to-the-neck Democrat coming out of New York, this is going to destroy your economy.
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:04.921]  It's going to destroy your state.
[00:37:05.161 --> 00:37:10.825]  You want to chase away the people who are actually generating revenue, paying the taxes to keep your social systems in order.
[00:37:11.145 --> 00:37:18.630]   When they leave, when they get chased out, when the government usurps that and squanders it because government can't do crap the way private enterprise can, You're all going to suffer.
[00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:20.271]  New York is going to suffer.
[00:37:20.511 --> 00:37:23.173]  The employees of the Trump organizations are going to suffer.
[00:37:24.314 --> 00:37:25.755]  Society as a whole is going to suffer.
[00:37:25.775 --> 00:37:26.755]  I was thinking of that today.
[00:37:26.835 --> 00:37:30.338]  Just like we see a mass exodus out of New York and California, it's going to accelerate now.
[00:37:30.618 --> 00:37:35.221]  And I noticed Democrats heard about the big trucker protest are refusing now to deliver goods to New York.
[00:37:35.661 --> 00:37:37.642]  The Democrats are all like, good, screw you.
[00:37:37.723 --> 00:37:38.423]  Don't come here.
[00:37:38.743 --> 00:37:39.824]  Don't deliver food.
[00:37:40.164 --> 00:37:41.485]  Don't deliver energy.
[00:37:41.985 --> 00:37:44.187]  And now the truckers are getting more pissed.
[00:37:44.787 --> 00:37:46.989]  Can't they see that they're destroying themselves?
[00:37:48.087 --> 00:37:52.749]  They can't see it because they think you go to the grocery store and things are always going to be on the shelves.
[00:37:52.969 --> 00:37:55.910]  They think that because they live in a big city that that is somehow self-sustaining.
[00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:59.731]  It's wild, and it's not just that it's going to accelerate.
[00:37:59.931 --> 00:38:03.252]  We're seeing it now, California citizen-wise to Florida.
[00:38:03.432 --> 00:38:04.813]  We're seeing it New York to Florida.
[00:38:04.873 --> 00:38:07.414]  I make a joke, I see more New Yorkers in Florida than I see Floridians.
[00:38:07.814 --> 00:38:11.055]  Now you're seeing the corporate exodus from Delaware.
[00:38:11.415 --> 00:38:18.699]   When you see activist judges coming in with politically motivated activist decisions, Chasing out successful enterprises.
[00:38:18.759 --> 00:38:19.399]  It's going to happen.
[00:38:19.439 --> 00:38:20.340]  It's happening everywhere.
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.100]  And what's going to happen?
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:22.541]  New York's going to be bankrupt.
[00:38:22.721 --> 00:38:23.862]  California's going to be bankrupt.
[00:38:24.082 --> 00:38:28.365]  Delaware is going to lose whatever corporate incentives it had to attract business in the first place.
[00:38:28.725 --> 00:38:35.290]  And lo and behold, when people are left starving, as they have been historically under socialist regimes, they're going to say, I don't know where it went wrong.
[00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:37.471]  We're watching where it's going wrong in real time.
[00:38:37.751 --> 00:38:43.455]  And if you're not paying attention, you're going to be left literally saying, why the heck are the shelves empty in New York City?
[00:38:43.615 --> 00:38:45.637]  And that's why the federalist system is so beautiful.
[00:38:45.677 --> 00:38:49.141]  People, when they hear me say I'm a federalist, they go, oh, you're for the feds.
[00:38:49.201 --> 00:39:08.941]   No, the federalism is the opposite of that, where the federal government's divided between three branches, the states are divided into 50 groups, they're in three branches to create bulkheads so that when a country or a former Colony, now a state, gets taken over, people have a chance to leave, and that creates the balance.
[00:39:09.001 --> 00:39:16.987]  Imagine if we were Venezuela, or someplace where they had full control, they could get away with this, but because they don't, people have a chance to move, so it illustrates it.
[00:39:18.038 --> 00:39:29.221]  Well, and people can, people will, and the states that are rejoicing in the political persecutions are going to suffer the consequences in the long term.
[00:39:29.602 --> 00:39:33.443]  But the bottom line, that New York decision, it's a laughable, sick joke.
[00:39:33.823 --> 00:39:37.264]  The only question that's going to be on appeal is there going to be a court that comes out.
[00:39:37.284 --> 00:39:40.945]  I'm not sure that I would trust the New York Court of the State Court of Appeal.
[00:39:40.965 --> 00:39:42.145]  I don't know where it goes from there.
[00:39:42.165 --> 00:39:50.396]   I don't even trust the Supreme Court because Again, they're putting so much pressure on the conservative justices for things that are legal, flying with friends on trips, whatever.
[00:39:50.696 --> 00:39:52.398]  Okay, on a scale of 1 of 100, it's like a 2.
[00:39:52.458 --> 00:39:55.420]  The Democrats are at 100, but they never get any media coverage.
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:59.783]  But I mean, I just hope the Supreme Court isn't being intimidated.
[00:40:00.864 --> 00:40:02.105]  Well, I mean, I think they are.
[00:40:02.125 --> 00:40:07.829]  When you wake up with people, you know, going to the front lawn of Kavanaugh and, you know, nobody cries about it.
[00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:10.331]  Saying they're going to kill him.
[00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:19.523]  It was bad, and the outcry was not nearly as proportionate to the seriousness as it should have been.
[00:40:19.983 --> 00:40:24.485]  But the courts have to step in, but at the end of the day also, there will be political hell to pay.
[00:40:25.345 --> 00:40:26.466]  Or there should be, there has to be.
[00:40:26.926 --> 00:40:28.747]  And there should be political repercussions.
[00:40:29.127 --> 00:40:33.709]  Stefanik has filed, she's filed a bar complaint, I think against Leticia James.
[00:40:33.969 --> 00:40:35.209]  I think she's filed an ethics complaint.
[00:40:35.229 --> 00:40:36.850]  Yeah, that's my next question, but just to digress back.
[00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:38.851]  Because it's such a big story.
[00:40:39.372 --> 00:40:43.095]  They did have massive death threats to all the conservative Supreme Court justices.
[00:40:43.455 --> 00:40:45.737]  And then hundreds, if not thousands, showing up at their houses.
[00:40:46.278 --> 00:40:47.298]  Absolutely, there's intimidation.
[00:40:47.318 --> 00:40:48.920]  But you've done a great job the time we have left.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:50.181]  Where do you want to go?
[00:40:50.221 --> 00:40:52.983]  The E. Jean Carroll, a recap of that, how crazy that was.
[00:40:53.023 --> 00:40:55.085]  And then, yeah, I saw a lot of your coverage.
[00:40:55.485 --> 00:40:56.246]  I'm a busy guy.
[00:40:56.266 --> 00:40:57.247]  You stole my time.
[00:40:57.587 --> 00:41:00.369]  I watched hours of your coverage and boildowns that were so good.
[00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:10.197]  Of what's happened with Fannie Willis and just how incredibly revealing this is and the arrogance and the insanity.
[00:41:10.217 --> 00:41:11.659]  So which one of those you want to tackle first?
[00:41:13.057 --> 00:41:14.518]  The E. Jean Carroll is easy enough.
[00:41:14.699 --> 00:41:17.921]  It's another ridiculous decision with ridiculous monetary compensation.
[00:41:17.941 --> 00:41:20.003]  $85 million, also out of New York.
[00:41:20.643 --> 00:41:27.068]  It's an attempt to bankrupt and just basically take private citizens' assets and reallocate them based on political orientation.
[00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:31.192]  And you had E. Jean Carroll, you know, on MSNBC gloating, what are you going to do with Trump's money?
[00:41:31.672 --> 00:41:33.934]  Oh, I'm going to take you on a shopping spree, Rachel Maddow.
[00:41:34.214 --> 00:41:41.600]  So that's a, it's a joke of a decision, especially because in my humble opinion, E. Jean Carroll is certifiably crazy and the world has seen it.
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:44.803]  But this is, Sunlight is the greatest disinfectant.
[00:41:45.263 --> 00:41:50.047]  Put these cameras on these trials and everyone will see in real time how preposterous it is.
[00:41:50.427 --> 00:41:53.470]  Fannie Willis, it's corruption to the core.
[00:41:53.810 --> 00:42:03.018]  The only amazing thing is they've been getting away with it for so long, they've gotten brazen and complacent in their corruption where they just think it's normal.
[00:42:03.058 --> 00:42:03.639]  How dare you?
[00:42:04.199 --> 00:42:07.641]  I mean, hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people are now witnessing the corruption in real time.
[00:42:07.661 --> 00:42:08.661]  By the way, that's at one time.
[00:42:08.481 --> 00:42:12.320]   next level and so that's why Jack Smith and others in the federal trials but also the
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.120]  state trials, they don't want cameras.
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:16.920]   That's very telling because when there are cameras they get destroyed.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:22.601]   Alex, I mean we had 25,000 people watching the Fannie Willis trial live on my channel
[00:42:22.601 --> 00:42:25.721]  alone, Robert Gouveia watching the watcher had 27,000.
[00:42:25.721 --> 00:42:29.961]   I mean hundreds of thousands if not millions of people are now witnessing the corruption
[00:42:29.961 --> 00:42:30.961]  in real time.
[00:42:30.961 --> 00:42:31.961]  By the way, that's it one time.
[00:42:31.961 --> 00:42:34.441]  You had millions of viewers.
[00:42:34.833 --> 00:42:38.775]  And then the recaps, I mean, people are understanding what's going on.
[00:42:39.055 --> 00:42:39.855]  And it is amazing.
[00:42:40.536 --> 00:42:44.238]  Cameras in the courtroom, there's a reason why some courts don't allow it, don't want it.
[00:42:44.438 --> 00:42:46.199]  There's a reason why some prosecutors don't want it.
[00:42:46.659 --> 00:42:50.401]  Once you see this corruption and once it's exposed to the world, people are going to say, what the hell is going on?
[00:42:50.421 --> 00:42:51.822]  My tax dollars are going for this?
[00:42:52.062 --> 00:42:56.946]  I mean, I'm literally paying... Oh, I was re-watching you like two nights ago at like 10 o'clock.
[00:42:56.966 --> 00:42:57.586]  My wife comes in.
[00:42:57.606 --> 00:42:58.827]  She goes, hey, the kids are asleep.
[00:42:58.847 --> 00:42:59.328]  Let's watch a movie.
[00:42:59.368 --> 00:43:00.709]  I said, no, I'm watching this.
[00:43:00.729 --> 00:43:01.850]  She said, I'm sick of politics.
[00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.930]  She starts watching.
[00:43:03.191 --> 00:43:04.612]  Two hours later, we're still watching it.
[00:43:07.194 --> 00:43:10.256]  This was as entertaining as like any episode of L.A.
[00:43:10.316 --> 00:43:12.538]  Law, except it's real in real time.
[00:43:12.918 --> 00:43:13.719]  We know that it's going there.
[00:43:14.389 --> 00:43:17.131]  But I mean, look, it's wild to see.
[00:43:17.351 --> 00:43:25.077]  I can't understand how some people are still reluctant to appreciate it and to condemn it, even if they like it, politically speaking.
[00:43:25.117 --> 00:43:28.419]  Michael Cohen was on, I think it was MSNBC yesterday.
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:38.666]  He's gloating in this Judge Engeron decision because a corrupt judge looks at Michael Cohen and says, this guy, it's not because he's a perjurer that he's always lying.
[00:43:38.987 --> 00:43:40.127]  And so there's vindication.
[00:43:40.147 --> 00:43:41.068]  Oh yeah, $355 million.
[00:43:42.669 --> 00:43:45.371]  Cool, I'm good with it, because it'll never happen to me.
[00:43:46.191 --> 00:43:51.414]  Anybody who thinks this will never happen to you because of political orientation, you're living in a pipe dream.
[00:43:51.494 --> 00:43:53.475]  That's where I was going, that's where I was going.
[00:43:53.936 --> 00:44:06.383]  Hitler was in World War I, Iron Cross first class, bad guy, but a war hero, and he would not allow nerve gas to be used because he got hit with German nerve gas twice when it blew back.
[00:44:07.003 --> 00:44:17.086]  So, in World War II, none of the groups, not the Allies, not the Nazis, didn't use nerve gas, because the term blowback comes from World War I, when the wind changes and it blows back on you.
[00:44:17.626 --> 00:44:17.947]  Okay?
[00:44:18.467 --> 00:44:21.068]  So, the issue is, don't they get blowback?
[00:44:21.128 --> 00:44:27.370]  It's already blown back immediately, but they still, but forget the political class not getting blowback.
[00:44:27.810 --> 00:44:34.975]   If Democrats were being persecuted by Republicans like this, I would say give them due process because I don't want to lose mine.
[00:44:35.355 --> 00:44:37.137]  Don't they get where chivalry came from?
[00:44:37.518 --> 00:44:41.223]  Chivalry doesn't come from being a pussy where we don't attack women and children.
[00:44:41.463 --> 00:44:43.505]  We do it because we don't want ours attacked.
[00:44:43.786 --> 00:44:46.850]  We know in a war it's a two-way street, dumbasses!
[00:44:49.044 --> 00:44:51.446]  And Alex, it's like they don't understand this.
[00:44:51.466 --> 00:44:55.889]  It's like you look at a Fannie Willis who's now corruptly prosecuting a Trump.
[00:44:56.510 --> 00:45:04.336]  Ask yourselves how many impoverished, disenfranchised, vulnerable people they've gotten away with doing the exact same thing to.
[00:45:04.676 --> 00:45:11.401]  For the party that clamors about criminal justice reform rejoicing in this, rejoicing in abuse of the civil process.
[00:45:11.781 --> 00:45:18.684]  This is how it was done, weaponized, used to imprison the vulnerable throughout history.
[00:45:18.984 --> 00:45:23.006]  And if anybody thinks, oh, I'm cool, I'm a Democrat in New York, well, get into a fight with your mayor.
[00:45:23.326 --> 00:45:30.969]  Get into a fight with the governor and see how they come after you for tax fraud because you overvalued your house for the purposes of a mortgage that you may have paid off.
[00:45:32.688 --> 00:45:34.728]  They will understand it by the time it's too late.
[00:45:34.748 --> 00:45:37.629]  And by the way, I knew this when they were doing it to me, theoretically.
[00:45:37.709 --> 00:45:43.390]  Now we know, these test cases on myself and Trump, they are now expanding massively.
[00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:46.631]  So they're definitely testing, using us as test cases.
[00:45:47.851 --> 00:45:48.351]  Well, for sure.
[00:45:48.431 --> 00:45:51.371]  I mean, I didn't even fully appreciate how you were the test case.
[00:45:52.272 --> 00:45:54.792]  On the one hand, for the lawfare, for the deplatforming.
[00:45:54.832 --> 00:45:57.313]  Like, once they got away with this... I didn't either, Aviva.
[00:45:57.473 --> 00:45:58.433]  I didn't understand it either.
[00:45:58.473 --> 00:45:58.873]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:46:00.653 --> 00:46:06.616]  I don't think anybody really appreciated it until they deplatformed the President of the United States of America while he was still sitting.
[00:46:06.916 --> 00:46:10.517]  And then fabricate these criminal charges out of January 6th.
[00:46:10.677 --> 00:46:14.959]  Orchestrate, in my humble opinion, let it happen, made it happen, whatever.
[00:46:15.419 --> 00:46:29.848]   January 6th, fedsurrection, so that you can fabricate these charges against Hundreds, thousands of people survey these people, surveil, I mean to say like spy on them, track them, use it as a pretext to persecute your political adversaries.
[00:46:30.169 --> 00:46:33.691]  They're going to do it at the highest levels and they're going to do it to everyone underneath.
[00:46:33.952 --> 00:46:37.414]  And if you don't understand that, I mean, they see the expression, the revolution eats its own.
[00:46:37.755 --> 00:46:40.917]  And, you know, the collaborators are just the last ones against the wall.
[00:46:41.318 --> 00:46:41.958]  It will happen.
[00:46:42.198 --> 00:46:44.520]  And so there better be some blowback to the blowback.
[00:46:44.901 --> 00:46:49.064]  If people don't understand this by the time they really do, it will definitely.
[00:46:49.264 --> 00:46:49.904]  I totally agree.
[00:46:49.924 --> 00:46:52.065]  I know you've got your own show coming up with Robert Barnes here soon.
[00:46:52.345 --> 00:46:52.966]  Thanks for the time.
[00:46:53.006 --> 00:46:54.446]  Join me again this week for a full hour with Robert.
[00:46:54.466 --> 00:46:55.867]  If you can do it, let's set that up right now.
[00:46:56.307 --> 00:46:58.108]  But separately, you're a smart guy.
[00:46:58.228 --> 00:46:59.769]  What are you predicting comes next?
[00:46:59.789 --> 00:47:02.570]  This is definitely backfiring, but they don't seem to care.
[00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:12.363]   I am predicting, and I hope it's not grotesque optimism, I'm predicting the E. Jean Carroll Verdict gets overturned.
[00:47:12.383 --> 00:47:15.928]  I mean, the evidentiary rules that were violated there, I think, are overwhelming.
[00:47:16.169 --> 00:47:17.431]  Sent back for a retrial?
[00:47:17.471 --> 00:47:17.791]  Maybe.
[00:47:19.233 --> 00:47:22.919]  In Angaran, look, it's not just that it needs to get overturned on appeal.
[00:47:23.099 --> 00:47:25.262]  Angaran needs to get sanctioned for what he's done.
[00:47:25.683 --> 00:47:26.705]  You read that decision.
[00:47:27.325 --> 00:47:34.427]  And it reads like a work of fiction written by an activist judge using this like ridiculous language.
[00:47:35.227 --> 00:47:40.268]  And it's just absurd in its conclusions and motivated reasoning.
[00:47:40.288 --> 00:47:47.670]  You knew that that's where the judge wanted to get to and just twists all of the evidence, excludes what he wants to exclude, allows what he wants to allow.
[00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:50.289]  summary judgments so that you can get there.
[00:47:50.289 --> 00:47:53.790]   It needs to be overturned in order to preserve any semblance of justice
[00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:55.790]  and people's faith in the judicial system.
[00:47:55.790 --> 00:48:00.190]   And if there's any justice, there will be some sanctions against the judge and Leticia James.
[00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:02.390]  If not sanctions, political repercussions.
[00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:06.190]   And a snapshot on Georgia. That's going to be the most ridiculous.
[00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:09.890]   I am predicting that Fannie and, um, dude, what's the guy's name?
[00:48:09.922 --> 00:48:11.683]  Nathan Wade are going to get disqualified.
[00:48:11.703 --> 00:48:18.568]  The judge, McAfee, who's been very reasonable, very objective, even if I, you know, I don't like all of his decisions, but I can understand them.
[00:48:18.969 --> 00:48:20.510]  I think he's disqualifying the two of them.
[00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:24.873]  He'll give it to another DA from another county and leave the political question up to that DA.
[00:48:25.153 --> 00:48:29.337]  But the courts have to start getting involved because it is a fundamental social fabric question.
[00:48:29.357 --> 00:48:37.163]  I was about to say, do the courts get they're being destroyed right now like the Justice Department's destroyed itself and the courts are just burning themselves down while they're laughing?
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.221]  I think the courts are starting to get it.
[00:48:40.321 --> 00:48:44.902]  Like, even if I looked at Canada, some of the COVID lawsuits in Canada, I think the courts are starting to get it.
[00:48:45.323 --> 00:48:53.826]  Public opinion is starting to change a little bit so that these judges might be getting a little more social courage to come up with the right and the righteous decisions.
[00:48:53.846 --> 00:48:54.206]  Well, that's right.
[00:48:54.226 --> 00:48:55.846]  For people that don't know, that's a whole other deal.
[00:48:55.866 --> 00:48:59.968]  You had a big high-level court say that Trudeau's basically trying to be a dictator and it was all illegal.
[00:49:01.199 --> 00:49:05.481]  In Canada, you got a federal judge saying the invocation of the Emergencies Act was unlawful.
[00:49:05.682 --> 00:49:12.325]  You got a provincial judge that ordered, basically declared a lot of these COVID public health orders to have been ultra-virus unlawful.
[00:49:12.605 --> 00:49:15.927]  So that political opinion tide is turning a little bit.
[00:49:16.387 --> 00:49:20.989]  But these judges in America, they have to understand, like, it's social fabric level stuff.
[00:49:21.029 --> 00:49:22.109]  Nobody trusts politicians.
[00:49:22.449 --> 00:49:23.870]  Nobody trusts the Department of Justice.
[00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:39.416]  If they can't trust the court system to resolve their matters peacefully, justfully, and equitably, for lack of a better word, in the court system, it's only a matter of time before the disagreements and the resolution of those disagreements spills into the streets, and not in a good way.
[00:49:39.776 --> 00:49:45.178]  So when people lose faith in the justice system, that's when societies fall.
[00:49:46.107 --> 00:49:46.407]  Viva!
[00:49:46.588 --> 00:49:47.309]  I know you gotta go.
[00:49:47.869 --> 00:49:50.352]  Get on the horn with my crew tonight.
[00:49:50.533 --> 00:49:51.213]  Talk to Bob.
[00:49:51.594 --> 00:49:54.958]  I want to get both you guys on for two-hour extravaganza like we did a month ago.
[00:49:55.399 --> 00:49:56.280]  Millions of people watched.
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:57.141]  Please join me this week.
[00:49:58.206 --> 00:49:58.946]  Thousand percent, Alex.
[00:49:59.187 --> 00:49:59.807]  Thank you so much, sir.
[00:50:00.187 --> 00:50:03.029]  Yeah, literally, I watched this guy like 10 hours this week.
[00:50:04.049 --> 00:50:05.630]  My wife's like, what is this?
[00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:07.551]  All of a sudden, he's like, well, let's keep watching him.
[00:50:08.072 --> 00:50:09.112]  He does a great job.
[00:50:09.152 --> 00:50:09.552]  Love that guy.
[00:50:09.893 --> 00:50:11.133]  OK, we're going to start the next hour.
[00:50:11.213 --> 00:50:12.154]  Huge other news.
[00:50:12.194 --> 00:50:12.894]  Show me other topics.
[00:50:13.255 --> 00:50:17.297]  But let me end this hour with a couple of clips that have been seen hundreds of millions of times.
[00:50:18.037 --> 00:50:18.598]  People get it.
[00:50:18.958 --> 00:50:24.121]  Here's a clip from the show trials in Connecticut and Texas that blew up in these scumbag faces.
[00:50:24.161 --> 00:50:24.461]  Here it is.
[00:50:25.988 --> 00:50:28.949]  And you've called this judge a tyrant, correct?
[00:50:29.329 --> 00:50:29.709]  Yes.
[00:50:29.869 --> 00:50:30.189]  Okay.
[00:50:30.469 --> 00:50:32.570]  And you actually use that word a lot with your audience.
[00:50:32.590 --> 00:50:34.050]  You call people tyrants, don't you?
[00:50:35.130 --> 00:50:36.130]  Only when they act like it.
[00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:51.794]  Oh my goodness!
[00:50:53.530 --> 00:51:05.161]  One of the things you've been talking about on your show is your allegation that government officials are aiding in pedophilia, child trafficking, and the grooming of children.
[00:51:05.481 --> 00:51:05.702]  Right?
[00:51:05.862 --> 00:51:08.324]  Well, you mean like what Jeffrey Epstein did with the Clintons?
[00:51:08.344 --> 00:51:08.524]  Clintons!
[00:51:08.544 --> 00:51:14.350]  With a huge shot!
[00:51:15.146 --> 00:51:15.807]  That is the right hand!
[00:51:15.847 --> 00:51:16.268]  Oh my goodness!

[00:51:52.966 --> 00:51:53.507]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:53.527 --> 00:51:53.887]  Stay with us.
[00:51:56.294 --> 00:51:57.235]  Hello, Americans!
[00:51:58.016 --> 00:51:59.617]  I want to share with you a story.
[00:52:00.278 --> 00:52:06.543]  A story about inflammation, the silent menace that lurks within our bodies, affecting our health and well-being.
[00:52:07.604 --> 00:52:13.409]  Inflammation, the root cause of countless ailments, quietly wreaking havoc over time.
[00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:22.137]  Long-term exposure to inflammation has been linked to a myriad of health issues, from heart disease to arthritis, even cognitive decline.
[00:52:23.154 --> 00:52:30.737]  But fear not, for there's a beacon of hope found in the wisdom of nature, a remedy that has stood the test of time, turmeric.
[00:52:31.522 --> 00:52:44.815]  And now I present to you Baudis from InfoWarStore.com, a powerful blend crafted with precision, boasting 95% curcuminoids extracted from turmeric.
[00:52:44.976 --> 00:52:46.937]  It's good for your heart, your brain, everything.

[00:52:52.603 --> 00:52:54.205]  InfoWarStore.com.
[00:52:58.436 --> 00:53:15.800]  If people somehow put aside the obvious danger to their ability to earn and maybe to their lives of saying what needs to be said, then we greatly outnumber those we are pitted against.
[00:53:16.321 --> 00:53:21.922]  They are ferociously powerful, but I would also point out this interesting error.
[00:53:22.802 --> 00:53:28.132]   So I call the force that we're up against Goliath, just so I'm Remember what the battle is.
[00:53:28.152 --> 00:53:49.018]  Goliath made a terrible mistake, and it made it most egregiously during COVID, which is it took all of the competent people, took all of the courageous people, and it shoved them out of the institutions where they were hanging on.
[00:53:51.218 --> 00:54:02.335]   And it created, in so doing, The Dream Team created every player you could possibly want on your team to fight some historic battle against a terrible evil.
[00:54:02.995 --> 00:54:06.398]  All of those people are now at least somewhat awake.
[00:54:06.858 --> 00:54:09.060]  They've now been picked on by the same enemy.
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:16.165]  And yeah, alright, we're outgunned, it has a tremendous amount of power, but we've got all of the people who know how to think.
[00:54:16.946 --> 00:54:28.959]   So, I hate to say it, or maybe I like to say it, but I don't think it's a slam dunk, but I like our odds.
[00:54:28.959 --> 00:54:35.558]   But to not appreciate the parts of the puzzle
[00:54:35.558 --> 00:54:41.039]   that nobody's expert at, right? They're dealing with complex systems layered
[00:54:41.039 --> 00:54:43.219]  upon each other.
[00:54:43.219 --> 00:54:48.678]   The ability to disrupt that stuff in a way that it stops functioning
[00:54:48.678 --> 00:54:53.838]   such that even the elites who make this happen are not going to like the world that they're going to
[00:54:53.838 --> 00:54:56.519]   create. They may not even be able to live in it.
[00:54:56.519 --> 00:55:00.479]  That's the biggest concern I have.
[00:55:00.464 --> 00:55:03.865]  That they were diabolical, but knew what they were doing.
[00:55:04.346 --> 00:55:10.928]  Then my sense is, well, alright, we're in for a bad hundred years, and that's terrible, but that's not extinction, right?
[00:55:11.768 --> 00:55:16.810]  I think we're actually headed for extinction because I think these people have no idea what they're playing with.
[00:55:17.191 --> 00:55:22.973]  They do not understand what needs to be preserved in order to keep the world functional enough for them to live in.
[00:55:23.293 --> 00:55:24.994]  How is that conversation not taking place?
[00:55:26.014 --> 00:55:28.397]  That's what doesn't make sense to me.
[00:55:28.477 --> 00:55:38.809]  Is it coming from a place where they never feel like they're ever going to go back to poverty or to any sort of chaotic world that we could envision if everything falls apart?
[00:55:39.009 --> 00:55:43.009]   They think they'll be protected ultimately because resources influence power.
[00:55:43.009 --> 00:55:50.009]   And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, "I don't know what's
[00:55:50.009 --> 00:55:57.367]  going to happen at the end of this, but you ought to fight!"
[00:55:57.609 --> 00:55:59.770]  You better believe you got one!
[00:56:01.912 --> 00:56:06.975]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:56:09.073 --> 00:56:14.157]  Alright, I got a ton of absolutely over-the-top, vital over-the-target information coming up.
[00:56:14.177 --> 00:56:20.262]  We're going to join a bunch of radio stations and TV stations that come back on with us at 6 after.
[00:56:20.282 --> 00:56:20.662]  It's 5.03.20.
[00:56:22.904 --> 00:56:30.670]  But look, those Dr. and former professor Brett Weinstein clips have gone viral from Joe's show and my show.
[00:56:35.143 --> 00:56:37.623]  Some people said, oh, he's saying the globalists are incompetent.
[00:56:38.024 --> 00:56:39.804]  They're so powerful, they've got a master plan.
[00:56:39.864 --> 00:56:40.444]  Yeah, they do.
[00:56:41.444 --> 00:56:46.545]  And they've got an evil force, Satan, that is encouraging them.
[00:56:46.565 --> 00:56:48.345]  But they themselves are fools.
[00:56:49.166 --> 00:56:51.366]  And they're not all powerful, and evil's not all powerful.
[00:56:52.086 --> 00:56:54.867]  And I've talked about this for almost 30 years on air.
[00:56:54.887 --> 00:56:56.327]  It'll be 30 years in the middle of April.
[00:56:56.347 --> 00:57:00.288]  I don't know the exact date, but I first got on air in 1994 in April.
[00:57:03.894 --> 00:57:07.755]  I did stuff a little bit before that, speaking to city councils and things, but it'll be 30 years in April.
[00:57:09.496 --> 00:57:22.560]  And I see all these other people saying, oh, there's no way Joe's for real or Tucker or this, you know, because they'd have a perfect pedigree of, you know, 30 years on air like myself or David Icke or somebody.
[00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:24.501]  That's just not how it works, folks.
[00:57:24.881 --> 00:57:29.143]  We're winning and we've got to be ready to start winning and turning the tide.
[00:57:29.523 --> 00:57:33.004]  And it doesn't mean we're offering some utopia like the left does or some perfect plan.
[00:57:33.976 --> 00:57:37.838]  But at least we're not with the new water plan to poison everybody and depopulate everybody.
[00:57:37.858 --> 00:57:42.140]  So we are winning hearts and minds.
[00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:43.560]  We're winning the information war.
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:47.402]  The globalists, though, still have physical control and the U.N.
[00:57:47.222 --> 00:57:54.222]  Entreaties Key.
[00:57:54.222 --> 00:57:59.581]   Alright, we're now into hour number two of this live Sunday, February 18th,
[00:57:59.581 --> 00:58:00.821]  2024 transmission.
[00:58:01.821 --> 00:58:05.303]  And the only reason we're still on air is because of you, and don't forget that.
[00:58:05.383 --> 00:58:06.944]  I appreciate you all, and I salute you.
[00:58:07.565 --> 00:58:15.150]  And I believe our most important work is still to come, but regardless, we put 30 years into this fight, so everything else from here is pure gravy.
[00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:20.873]  Because now, I've said a thousand times or more on air, my goal is to become obsolete.
[00:58:21.594 --> 00:58:26.917]  My goal is for people to finally get their under attack and start researching the New World Order's battle plans.
[00:58:26.957 --> 00:58:29.359]  They've been so arrogant, almost all of it's public.
[00:58:30.458 --> 00:58:32.199]  And it's starting to happen.
[00:58:34.141 --> 00:58:35.822]  It's starting to happen.
[00:58:37.523 --> 00:58:47.110]  Unfortunately, so much of the plan is already in place, they have passed the event horizon or the point of no return.
[00:58:50.612 --> 00:58:52.013]  The system is going to crash.
[00:58:53.835 --> 00:58:58.378]  But will it be a controlled crash, a survivable crash, or unsurvivable?
[00:58:59.858 --> 00:59:02.939]  I wished I could turn this around, but I can read the Bible, we don't.
[00:59:04.519 --> 00:59:20.002]  And it's before the beast wages war against the saints and overcomes them, read Revelation, that then you have a few years of hell and then the greatest revival ever seen comes out of that.
[00:59:20.082 --> 00:59:23.902]  So, the devil doesn't win when he wins that battle.
[00:59:26.263 --> 00:59:32.357]   We're planting the seeds So that when that tyranny comes, it's like sunlight and water to seeds.
[00:59:34.378 --> 00:59:35.118]  Then they sprout.
[00:59:36.519 --> 00:59:38.700]  But we are the gowletters.
[00:59:40.221 --> 00:59:43.402]  We are the men and women preparing the way.
[00:59:45.824 --> 00:59:47.324]  That's what we're appointed to do.
[00:59:48.785 --> 00:59:50.266]  We've been appointed for a purpose.
[00:59:52.227 --> 01:00:01.403]   And I am just extremely, not proud, Not invigorated, but satisfied.
[01:00:02.965 --> 01:00:06.989]  I've never in my life been so satisfied.
[01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:13.696]  Growing up, I was a great looking guy and strong and smart and had anything I wanted.
[01:00:15.598 --> 01:00:20.403]  Hang out with the coolest people, have all the best women, but I wasn't satisfied.
[01:00:22.199 --> 01:00:34.630]  And it wasn't until I went under the attack of the New World Order and committed to this war that I have become so satisfied that I don't even feel like I've been alive until 10 years ago.
[01:00:35.550 --> 01:00:36.892]  I'm a totally different man.
[01:00:37.952 --> 01:00:40.173]  And the reason I tell everybody that is this.
[01:00:40.913 --> 01:01:01.520]  All these evil people keep committing acts of evil thinking it's going to satisfy them and they keep upping the ante doing worse and worse things thinking magically somehow they're going to be satisfied and you're not going to become satisfied until you learn the truth and then stand for the truth and then you are persecuted for the truth.
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:04.160]  Because I'm not a sadomasochist.
[01:01:05.001 --> 01:01:05.741]  I don't like pain.
[01:01:07.262 --> 01:01:07.942]  Until now.
[01:01:09.743 --> 01:01:25.306]  And for every painful thing that happens, and like Job, I say, God, I believe in you, and I understand you're teaching me, and then as soon as I make that decision, within hours or days, new doors blow open.
[01:01:25.766 --> 01:01:26.907]  Blast open.
[01:01:30.247 --> 01:01:32.688]  It's literally like a video game as you pass each level.
[01:01:33.826 --> 01:01:43.228]  And each level I escape further from Satan's control, further from his temptations, further from his grasp, closer to God every day, every minute.
[01:01:44.388 --> 01:01:52.890]  And then you look back, and you see the evil people serving corruption, and how they think they're the winning team, and you feel sorry for them.
[01:01:54.690 --> 01:01:56.270]  Because most of them are just deceived.
[01:01:56.950 --> 01:02:00.451]  But a small percentage of them have committed the ultimate sin.
[01:02:01.903 --> 01:02:10.725]  They have the intellect, they have the spirit, they have the potential in God's plan to serve the master.
[01:02:12.926 --> 01:02:33.211]   And they made the decision consciously when God laid out a plan to them and they followed it under free will to do incredible things and empower people, but they look at God and they say, it is better to reign in hell Then serve in heaven.
[01:02:37.793 --> 01:02:39.033]  Something's wrong with them.
[01:02:40.594 --> 01:02:55.721]   I mean, if you call no in the future, and absolutely being satisfied and being incredibly confident, And every moment is just pleasure and everything is so beautiful.
[01:02:55.781 --> 01:02:57.662]  It's beautiful things that are uglier, even uglier.
[01:02:58.323 --> 01:03:01.465]  If you call this service, well, give me a lot more of this.
[01:03:02.686 --> 01:03:05.908]  Give me a lot more of this.
[01:03:07.289 --> 01:03:15.475]  But somehow they got interdicted at a point in their life by the devil that they have no idea what we're even talking about.
[01:03:15.815 --> 01:03:18.537]  We might as well be talking Martian to these globalists.
[01:03:20.455 --> 01:03:22.315]  But I'm not looking to try to convert them.
[01:03:22.415 --> 01:03:24.336]  They've committed the ultimate sin.
[01:03:24.456 --> 01:03:27.736]  They have refused the Holy Spirit.
[01:03:30.677 --> 01:03:33.478]  It's unbelievable that they've done it.
[01:03:35.778 --> 01:03:36.198]  Wow!
[01:03:36.798 --> 01:03:37.298]  Okay.
[01:03:37.699 --> 01:03:44.380]  You just refused absolute perfection, absolute eternity, total consciousness?
[01:03:45.325 --> 01:03:49.148]  You don't have that, but you are literally in Congress with that.
[01:03:49.209 --> 01:03:50.470]  You are interfacing.
[01:03:51.030 --> 01:03:53.192]  God is the groom.
[01:03:53.312 --> 01:03:54.073]  You are the bride.
[01:03:55.955 --> 01:04:00.579]  You are literally being brought into a system of ascension.
[01:04:02.421 --> 01:04:08.220]   And just as the blasters, just as the main engines, you watch how a rocket takes off,
[01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:12.621]   it's moving a few inches a second at first, then a few feet, then a hundred feet a second,
[01:04:12.621 --> 01:04:17.061]   then a thousand feet a second, and you watch it take off slow and then (whooshing)
[01:04:17.061 --> 01:04:23.760]   I mean, you immediately dial into this and it's like the engine (whooshing)
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:36.280]   I mean, the difference between Christ energy and satanic energy is not even a difference.
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:37.121]  It can be, it.
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:38.920]  It's not even in the same universe.
[01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:40.820]  It's so pathetic.
[01:04:42.021 --> 01:04:52.243]  When you look at this judge in New York, Ingeron, or Letitia James, or V.I.
[01:04:52.283 --> 01:04:58.024]  Lennon, or Mao Zedong, you look at these sacks of weakness.
[01:04:59.178 --> 01:05:03.700]  And you ask, how could they... How could something be this disgusting?
[01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:05.960]  They love it!
[01:05:06.961 --> 01:05:07.721]  They think it's funny!
[01:05:10.822 --> 01:05:13.603]  And so I hope they revel in their time.
[01:05:17.084 --> 01:05:19.765]  Because the devil sends the beast with wrath.
[01:05:20.425 --> 01:05:22.486]  Because he knows his time is short.
[01:05:23.767 --> 01:05:24.847]  My time is not short.
[01:05:26.888 --> 01:05:27.368]  I will...
[01:05:29.144 --> 01:05:30.925]  Be grafted into God's consciousness.
[01:05:32.185 --> 01:05:39.148]  If I'm successful, and I pray I will be, and I will be eternal.
[01:05:43.549 --> 01:05:45.810]  Imagine eternity cut off from God.
[01:05:48.211 --> 01:05:49.892]  Everything we have, God gave us.
[01:05:50.312 --> 01:05:52.053]  Everything we are, God made us.
[01:05:53.093 --> 01:06:00.093]  and you would deny your father.
[01:06:00.093 --> 01:06:12.253]   Alright, let's shift out of the preaching and let's talk about the news because I've prepared as
[01:06:12.253 --> 01:06:14.812]   usual quite a bit for this broadcast.
[01:06:14.892 --> 01:06:21.853]  I come in here usually and prepare for seven, eight hours and then cover one-tenth of it and that's okay.
[01:06:22.714 --> 01:06:27.935]  It's in all my research of this that I can then understand the enemy's operations and how to counter it.
[01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:33.451]  But, I'll just say this.
[01:06:34.272 --> 01:06:44.058]  I am so sad for all of you that have not chosen God, and who are in opposition to God, and who are in rebellion to God.
[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:52.883]  You will be broken into a thousand pieces, and then broken again and again.
[01:06:54.639 --> 01:07:02.623]  And not by God's hand, but by your decision to separate from the eternal consciousness.
[01:07:06.965 --> 01:07:09.887]  You have damned yourselves to hell.
[01:07:12.648 --> 01:07:17.731]  And I know you think you're gonna claw a bunch of children and innocents along with you.
[01:07:21.093 --> 01:07:33.159]   But I know in God's great mercy, and great perfection that all of your delusional plans will be destroyed.
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:41.840]   But now let's end the Sunday Bible hour and move into the news.
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:53.440]   Tedros, the head of the World Health Organization, an admitted Marxist-Leninist communist who
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:08:01.960]   helped the UN kill over a million of his people in Ethiopia, not giving medical aid to them over a decade ago, was
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:08.719]   promoted because of his willingness to kill his own people.
[01:08:08.719 --> 01:08:18.719]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:08:09.841 --> 01:08:23.771]  Just like Gigi Ping sat there in the 1960s and watched his sister beaten to death by the Maoist youth brigades in the struggle session.
[01:08:26.153 --> 01:08:29.295]  And watched his father beaten half to death by the crowd.
[01:08:29.315 --> 01:08:37.581]  And he joined in and kicked his father in the face and spit on him when his father had done nothing but own a farm and employ people.
[01:08:38.763 --> 01:08:45.390]  Satan saw that and how beautiful it was to his sickening eye and said, you will betray your sister.
[01:08:46.311 --> 01:08:47.672]  You will betray your father.
[01:08:48.933 --> 01:08:50.635]  You're a man after my own heart.
[01:08:53.057 --> 01:09:08.021]   And so now we see the United Nations and their World Government Pandemic Treaty Openly takes control of every major government at the government's invitation.
[01:09:08.041 --> 01:09:11.722]  Pedro said a few weeks ago, we don't make you do it, you sign it.
[01:09:12.782 --> 01:09:15.964]  We don't control you and lock you in your house and make you take shots.
[01:09:16.564 --> 01:09:17.804]  Your governments do.
[01:09:22.046 --> 01:09:28.688]  And so their treaty, the final version of it published weeks ago, they say they're probably going to write a new one.
[01:09:29.509 --> 01:09:30.529]  Whatever they say is a lie.
[01:09:34.551 --> 01:09:47.679]  And Tedros says, oh, there'll be disease X and disease Y and disease Z. And if you don't sign on to the treaty, I can't protect you.
[01:09:47.699 --> 01:09:50.301]  That's called putting a gun to your head.
[01:09:50.741 --> 01:09:52.422]  It's called holding you hostage.
[01:09:54.143 --> 01:09:56.645]  It's called a global government power grab.
[01:09:57.904 --> 01:10:12.193]  And all the actuaries and insurance company and government numbers and government whistleblowers come out and how that their people are dying 20 plus million and record cancer and all the disease and everything and the infertility.
[01:10:12.213 --> 01:10:18.677]  And there's Tedros up there at the World Government Forum.
[01:10:20.338 --> 01:10:22.039]  At the World Government Forum.
[01:10:24.527 --> 01:10:27.829]  Oh, the New York Times and the Washington Post.
[01:10:28.509 --> 01:10:30.531]  They say there's no world government.
[01:10:30.591 --> 01:10:32.232]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[01:10:32.712 --> 01:10:33.852]  It's a pipe dream.
[01:10:33.932 --> 01:10:34.893]  It's a lie.
[01:10:37.234 --> 01:10:42.857]  But there they are at their World Government Summit in Dubai.
[01:10:44.118 --> 01:10:47.420]  And Klaus Schwab, in fact, that clip's from Friday.
[01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:48.621]  Pull that up, too.
[01:10:49.701 --> 01:11:07.113]  Klaus Schwab comes out and says, oh yes, we're going to take over your bodies now and perfect you with nanotechs and chips in your blood and we're going to have one giant hive mind and everything will be just, whether it could happen or not, it's all theoretical.
[01:11:07.433 --> 01:11:21.399]   This is psychotic, crazy, cult stuff with a Dr. Evil German whose grandfather was the third largest defense contractor for Adolf Hitler.
[01:11:21.399 --> 01:11:35.597]   And they just sit up there and tell you how they're doing all of this and how great it is.
[01:11:35.777 --> 01:11:44.570]   So you better pass our treaty Or we can't protect you from the new disease that's coming.
[01:11:44.930 --> 01:12:03.995]  What person in their right mind, not knowing the history of biological testing on different countries, including the U.S., or how they cooked it up in a lab, or how the poison shots erase your immune system, and how they create spike proteins from HIV in your body, and you're sitting there watching a guy that murdered over a million of his people under U.N.
[01:12:04.075 --> 01:12:08.636]  orders not to give medicine to people that had cholera.
[01:12:10.373 --> 01:12:12.514]  Christians he killed, to make room for the Muslims.
[01:12:12.554 --> 01:12:13.194]  Take a breather.
[01:12:16.075 --> 01:12:21.036]  And you just sit there and you think, why in the hell would anybody listen to this guy?
[01:12:21.136 --> 01:12:21.797]  Well, they're not.
[01:12:22.517 --> 01:12:30.279]  The average American still got a movie they're going to go to, or a Netflix show they're going to watch, or some party they're going to go to.
[01:12:30.319 --> 01:12:31.119]  Because you know what?
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:35.721]  I'm not going to let the world get in the way of my fun.
[01:12:36.988 --> 01:12:42.191]  But you look at those people that spend all their time in entertainment and all their time just having fun.
[01:12:42.511 --> 01:12:44.833]  They are the most miserable people on earth.
[01:12:45.253 --> 01:12:53.098]  While this globalist wants to own your body, we're just supposed to sit back and say, that's okay.
[01:12:57.641 --> 01:13:02.744]  Fannie Willis can persecute the real President of the United States, try to put him in prison for questioning election fraud.
[01:13:03.965 --> 01:13:05.286]  She's black, so it's okay.
[01:13:07.506 --> 01:13:10.307]  Tedros is black, so it's okay if he kills a million of his own people.
[01:13:10.327 --> 01:13:17.730]  It's okay if the UN and the Clintons kill millions of Christians in Rwanda, because, you know, they're liberals.
[01:13:18.691 --> 01:13:34.209]   And I love how, I'm talking about this next segment, when I publish on X or InfoWars, I think it's 5-10 million views, Just some white man walking down the street and 10 black people run over and beat him to death.
[01:13:34.229 --> 01:13:37.833]  And I see the comments from liberals going, why are you promoting racism?
[01:13:38.954 --> 01:13:48.045]  If there was video of 10 white people beating a black person to death, I would instantly publish it and instantly say it was wrong.
[01:13:50.575 --> 01:14:04.305]  But I can't sit here while I watch all these brutal attacks the leftists promote and the Soros-controlled DAs have let the criminals know there's a green light to rob and kill white people and then say it's okay to have open season on white people.
[01:14:07.548 --> 01:14:09.469]  I'm against open season on black people.
[01:14:09.589 --> 01:14:10.730]  I care about everybody.
[01:14:11.070 --> 01:14:17.115]  I fight against the fact that over half the abortions in this country with blacks only being 13% of the population.
[01:14:18.191 --> 01:14:18.851]  Are black people.
[01:14:19.171 --> 01:14:20.832]  I fight to not kill black babies.
[01:14:21.152 --> 01:14:22.072]  Because we're all human.
[01:14:22.092 --> 01:14:24.592]  And we all are made by God.
[01:14:24.612 --> 01:14:25.373]  And I'm against that.
[01:14:26.093 --> 01:14:27.213]  But I will not sit here.
[01:14:28.253 --> 01:14:29.413]  And I will not watch.
[01:14:30.214 --> 01:14:31.454]  And see the crime statistics.
[01:14:31.474 --> 01:14:33.694]  20 to 1 black on white crime.
[01:14:33.854 --> 01:14:34.214]  Look it up.
[01:14:34.514 --> 01:14:35.555]  The Fed tried to suppress it.
[01:14:35.975 --> 01:14:38.295]  Because they're advertising go kill the white people.
[01:14:39.115 --> 01:14:41.796]  And say that's okay when they kill a bunch of white farmers.
[01:14:42.136 --> 01:14:44.537]  And the left says they deserve to die in South Africa.
[01:14:45.397 --> 01:14:46.537]  And the blacks are going to starve to death.
[01:14:47.774 --> 01:14:48.235]  I will not.
[01:14:48.615 --> 01:14:55.545]  So I told everybody, the more you bully me and the more you tell me not to cover this, the more I will cover it.
[01:14:56.166 --> 01:15:00.472]  So you don't get one post a week of racist blacks attacking whites.
[01:15:00.793 --> 01:15:02.876]  You get five a day now and keep complaining.
[01:15:02.936 --> 01:15:03.216]  You'll get 50.
[01:15:04.775 --> 01:15:13.879]  Because the real issue is, why can I find 50 videos a day of racist black people attacking white people, but I can't find one a day of white people?
[01:15:14.099 --> 01:15:18.280]  And when it occasionally happens, it's the top story in the country, because they all want us killing each other.
[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:20.801]  And use your brains, black people, you're smart.
[01:15:21.321 --> 01:15:22.522]  And white people, you're smart.
[01:15:23.507 --> 01:15:36.974]  When everybody sees this being done to whites and no one's told it's part of a globalist Soros new war plan, whites are going to become anti-black when the vast majority of black people are hard-working good folks and do not support this.
[01:15:37.354 --> 01:15:47.320]  So black and white have to come out and say no war on white people, no knockout games, no Rob Whitey, none of this, which the majority of blacks are for.
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:49.501]  They're against that, so am I.
[01:15:50.831 --> 01:15:55.473]  We have to get past this Soros operation and decry it for what it is.
[01:15:56.134 --> 01:15:58.875]  And then we can save the unborn children no matter what color they are.
[01:15:58.895 --> 01:16:00.776]  They have beautiful souls made by God.
[01:16:02.397 --> 01:16:03.337]  So here's Tedros.
[01:16:04.117 --> 01:16:06.399]  He's got over a million dead black people under his belt.
[01:16:06.439 --> 01:16:06.859]  Look it up.
[01:16:08.039 --> 01:16:09.180]  But it's okay because he's black.
[01:16:11.069 --> 01:16:13.090]  And here he is now saying he owns all our bodies.
[01:16:13.370 --> 01:16:18.372]  They put him in there as a black communist that murdered his own people so they can defend it.
[01:16:18.392 --> 01:16:19.332]  Oh, it's racist!
[01:16:19.693 --> 01:16:23.034]  You don't want the UN to run your life and take over your body.
[01:16:23.094 --> 01:16:24.114]  It's a black man!
[01:16:24.514 --> 01:16:26.835]  Yeah, a black man working for the New World Order.
[01:16:27.075 --> 01:16:30.497]  It has nothing to do with what color Tedros' skin is.
[01:16:31.757 --> 01:16:34.298]  Everything to do with the fact that he is a Bill Gates frontman.
[01:16:35.779 --> 01:16:37.700]  And I'll say it, our problem is old white men.
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:41.642]  They're the ones funding all the Hollywood movies, putting down white people.
[01:16:41.922 --> 01:16:48.427]  It's all a bunch of old Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, Larry Fink, Lord Rothschild.
[01:16:49.288 --> 01:16:53.031]  All of these scum think we're stupid and we're all just going to kill each other.
[01:16:53.871 --> 01:16:56.073]  And I want that to stop and have us stand in unity.
[01:16:56.453 --> 01:16:57.074]  But first...
[01:16:58.342 --> 01:17:05.927]  Black people gotta see that Black Lives Matter funded by Soros' main mission is to end the nuclear black family and make black men cut their testicles off.
[01:17:05.967 --> 01:17:07.368]  Look it up, it's in their charter.
[01:17:07.808 --> 01:17:09.689]  Their main mission is to end the black family.
[01:17:09.949 --> 01:17:11.110]  That's your enemy, not me!
[01:17:11.370 --> 01:17:12.511]  I'm not trying to abort you!
[01:17:12.751 --> 01:17:13.952]  I'm not trying to kill your babies!
[01:17:15.069 --> 01:17:17.031]  I don't want your babies to grow up to be brainwashed.
[01:17:17.111 --> 01:17:21.876]  See, if Jordan Soros can't kill your babies, they're gonna try to turn them into thugs with gangster rap.
[01:17:22.176 --> 01:17:27.000]  Even Ice Cube came out in CIA programming to turn them into thugs so that they can fill up the prisons.
[01:17:27.621 --> 01:17:35.629]  And on the side, kill a bunch of white people to turn white people into racists, so we're not political on issues, we're just political on race.
[01:17:36.169 --> 01:17:38.411]  I've seen the plan, and we're exposing it.
[01:17:39.012 --> 01:17:40.073]  And we're gonna beat it together.
[01:17:41.391 --> 01:17:50.756]  But first off, we gotta challenge political correctness, whether it's transgenderism, or open borders, or white people being told we gotta sit here and take a bunch of stuff because of what color we are.
[01:17:51.997 --> 01:17:52.998]  I got four children.
[01:17:54.498 --> 01:17:59.001]  I've tried to shelter them from the system, and they get told everywhere they're bad because of what color they are.
[01:17:59.541 --> 01:18:01.422]  That ain't black people came up with that!
[01:18:01.442 --> 01:18:04.704]  Because black people aren't that evil!
[01:18:06.325 --> 01:18:09.547]  The globalists came up with that, and we all know it!
[01:18:11.550 --> 01:18:19.352]  So we all need to stop singing to the tune and playing along with the Pied Piper of the ADL and the New World Order.
[01:18:22.293 --> 01:18:24.994]  The Southern Poverty Law Center and all the rest of that garbage.
[01:18:25.354 --> 01:18:32.136]  Here's Tedros saying, I got a gun to your head, more diseases are coming, let me run your life or I can't protect you.
[01:18:32.376 --> 01:18:34.077]  Here he is with a gun to your head.
[01:18:36.414 --> 01:18:48.001]  The painful lessons we learned are in danger of being forgotten as attention turns to many other crises confronting our world.
[01:18:50.342 --> 01:18:58.908]  But if we fail to learn those lessons, we will pay dearly next time.
[01:19:00.949 --> 01:19:02.650]  And there will be a next time.
[01:19:04.076 --> 01:19:09.239]  History teaches us that the next pandemic is a matter of when, not if.
[01:19:11.541 --> 01:19:30.954]  It may be caused by an influenza virus, or a new coronavirus, or it may be caused by a new pathogen we don't even know about yet, or what we call disease X. There has been a lot of attention on disease X.
[01:19:33.683 --> 01:19:34.663]  Especially recently.
[01:19:35.223 --> 01:19:38.004]  But in fact, it's not a new thing.
[01:19:39.645 --> 01:19:42.425]  We first used the term Disease X in 2018.
[01:19:42.525 --> 01:19:49.767]  It was just the same time I spoke here in this government summit in 2018.
[01:19:51.348 --> 01:19:57.490]  And we used Disease X as a placeholder for a disease we don't even know about yet.
[01:19:57.710 --> 01:19:58.690]  And it magically showed up.
[01:19:58.750 --> 01:20:02.271]  But for which we can nonetheless prepare.
[01:20:04.619 --> 01:20:11.004]  COVID-19 was a disease X. A new pathogen causing a new disease.
[01:20:11.044 --> 01:20:12.506]  That she made in the lab, you piece of filth.
[01:20:12.526 --> 01:20:29.240]  But there will be another disease X. Or a disease Y. Or a disease Z. And as things stand, the world remains unprepared for the next disease X and the next pandemic.
[01:20:30.928 --> 01:20:35.890]  So, I did a two-hour-plus deep dive this week for Stephen Crowder's Mug Club.
[01:20:35.910 --> 01:20:39.090]  We're gonna air some excerpts this week of it on Satanism.
[01:20:39.130 --> 01:20:42.191]  Now, it's all over the news, all the media, being openly promoted.
[01:20:42.311 --> 01:20:47.933]  Cannibalism, Satanism, abortion clinics that say, come here, we're a Satan-run operation.
[01:20:48.353 --> 01:20:49.994]  When we kill your baby, it's a ritual.
[01:20:50.494 --> 01:20:51.474]  That's mainstream news.
[01:20:52.855 --> 01:20:57.556]  And then, meanwhile, the media runs around, at the same time they're promoting it, saying it doesn't exist.
[01:20:59.090 --> 01:21:00.751]  Well, the same thing goes on for slavery.
[01:21:00.851 --> 01:21:05.573]  So I'm not going to try to do a history of slavery here for everybody, but slavery is in the Bible.
[01:21:05.653 --> 01:21:06.533]  It's in the Koran.
[01:21:07.094 --> 01:21:08.254]  It's in every culture.
[01:21:08.314 --> 01:21:10.455]  The ancient Mesoamericans had slaves.
[01:21:11.575 --> 01:21:13.036]  In Asia, people were slaves.
[01:21:13.076 --> 01:21:14.237]  People were slaves in Europe.
[01:21:14.557 --> 01:21:16.778]  The Romans mainly had white slaves out of Europe.
[01:21:17.778 --> 01:21:35.093]  Black slavers out of North Africa invaded Spain, and the numbers are shipped more white slaves to Africa than were ever shipped in the transatlantic slave trade that started 500 years ago out of Africa into the Caribbean, into Central and South America, into the U.S.
[01:21:35.393 --> 01:21:36.514]  And no one's defending it.
[01:21:36.574 --> 01:21:37.815]  None of us were involved in that.
[01:21:37.855 --> 01:21:38.476]  They're alive.
[01:21:38.816 --> 01:21:40.017]  Black, white, doesn't matter.
[01:21:40.077 --> 01:21:47.402]   The idea that you're guilty because you're white because Some white person hundreds of years ago had slaves is preposterous.
[01:21:49.563 --> 01:21:53.624]  And the idea that you're black and some black ancestor did something is just ridiculous.
[01:21:53.725 --> 01:21:56.626]  If your dad commits a murder and you weren't part of it, you're not guilty.
[01:21:56.886 --> 01:22:00.387]  How the hell is somebody 500 years ago, how are you guilty of that?
[01:22:01.708 --> 01:22:07.731]  So yeah, I can show you video of slave auctions going on all over Africa currently.
[01:22:08.416 --> 01:22:10.137]  And so I decided to post one of these.
[01:22:10.917 --> 01:22:18.121]  Women and children being sold for as cheap as $400 apiece from Libya in the north all the way down to Central Africa and the Congo.
[01:22:18.941 --> 01:22:22.343]  And the Christian areas of Africa do not allow slavery.
[01:22:23.063 --> 01:22:23.583]  It's a fact.
[01:22:24.144 --> 01:22:31.087]  The Muslim areas and the animist areas, they worship animals, they have it.
[01:22:32.588 --> 01:22:35.769]  So there are tens of millions of slaves in Africa right now.
[01:22:36.029 --> 01:22:36.930]  I have all the numbers right here.
[01:22:38.223 --> 01:22:59.683]  So I posted a video on X yesterday that's got millions and millions and millions of views of reportedly an auction where they kidnap one tribe of people and sell them to the next tribe, usually it's Christians they capture, and they have them in bags as a presentation of the women to have kids around the household who work for them and work in the fields and do all the rest of it.
[01:23:01.308 --> 01:23:03.329]  And people said, oh no, there's no slavery in Africa.
[01:23:03.730 --> 01:23:10.130]   Then I saw comments by prominent people on X saying white people invented slavery.
[01:23:10.130 --> 01:23:23.010]   The most continual institution in human populations since recorded history 7,000 years ago slavery.
[01:23:23.224 --> 01:23:23.484]  Okay?
[01:23:24.645 --> 01:23:25.926]  So everybody did it.
[01:23:26.466 --> 01:23:27.807]  None of us are guilty for it.
[01:23:28.108 --> 01:23:29.549]  Those people are all long dead.
[01:23:31.118 --> 01:23:41.241]  But the point is, is that they're trying to create this guilt to create this division and act like modern white people have something to do with what happened in the past.
[01:23:41.501 --> 01:23:44.062]  By the way, you can look this up.
[01:23:45.182 --> 01:23:50.724]  About 220 years ago, the abolition movement had started really 300 years ago in England.
[01:23:52.004 --> 01:23:54.945]  But about 220 years ago, they got control of the parliament.
[01:23:56.144 --> 01:24:03.747]  And England, you can say use it as an excuse, but they banned slavery in the entire areas they controlled.
[01:24:04.007 --> 01:24:11.470]  They went to war with eight different countries over the next 30 years to try to end slavery.
[01:24:12.371 --> 01:24:16.973]  So if you want to give credit to anybody, England and the British Empire is who did it.
[01:24:19.594 --> 01:24:21.735]  But it's still going on in the Middle East.
[01:24:21.815 --> 01:24:22.955]  It's still going on in Africa.
[01:24:23.435 --> 01:24:25.056]  It's still going on in some areas of the Pacific.
[01:24:26.377 --> 01:24:27.818]  So I want to roll some of this video.
[01:24:28.518 --> 01:24:33.780]  Slavery is still practiced across large areas of Africa, but because it's black-on-black slavery, the Western media will not cover it.
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:46.885]  And just like Western women love packaging and presentation, it's key to marketing, watch the children being advertised like the women are shopping at a purse store or something, and there's like the gender reveal, but oh, what's in this little bag?
[01:24:46.945 --> 01:24:47.706]  What's in that bag?
[01:24:48.066 --> 01:24:52.268]  Some of these kids are as young as three years old being sold.
[01:24:53.328 --> 01:25:01.670]   And it's terrible, but these are the lucky ones because They're going to be put out there as field hands and seriously beaten or killed if they don't work.
[01:25:02.651 --> 01:25:11.593]  Many of the people being sold end up in sex slavery and organ harvesting or in lithium or different mines for electric vehicle batteries.
[01:25:11.653 --> 01:25:19.876]  And we can show you kids as young as five working 18 hours a day bare feet in toxic sludge mining chemicals.
[01:25:21.449 --> 01:25:22.930]  And you bet the globalists are involved.
[01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:24.451]  You bet old white men are making the money.
[01:25:24.771 --> 01:25:28.433]  But my point is, why don't you hear about that from Black Lives Matter?
[01:25:28.713 --> 01:25:30.994]  Because you're not supposed to talk about that, folks.
[01:25:32.115 --> 01:25:33.015]  Skip this break coming up.
[01:25:34.036 --> 01:25:35.877]  So let's play for TV viewers, you'll be able to see us.
[01:25:35.957 --> 01:25:42.440]  Radio listeners, this is an African, so most of you won't be able to pick up the language, whether it's Conganese or whatever it is.
[01:25:43.321 --> 01:25:44.001]  But here it is.
[01:25:46.712 --> 01:25:48.712]  We are going to teach you how to pray.
[01:25:48.712 --> 01:25:50.712]  We will wait for your video to be uploaded.
[01:25:50.712 --> 01:25:52.712]  We will teach you how to pray.
[01:25:52.712 --> 01:25:54.712]  We will wait for your video to be uploaded.
[01:25:54.712 --> 01:25:58.712]   In the name of God Amen
[01:25:58.712 --> 01:26:02.712]   Amen Amen
[01:26:02.712 --> 01:26:06.712]   Amen Amen
[01:26:06.712 --> 01:26:10.712]   Amen Amen
[01:26:10.712 --> 01:26:14.712]   Amen Amen
[01:26:14.712 --> 01:26:18.712]   Amen Amen
[01:26:18.712 --> 01:26:22.712]   Amen Amen
[01:26:22.712 --> 01:26:26.712]   Amen Amen
[01:26:26.712 --> 01:26:30.712]   Amen Amen
[01:26:30.712 --> 01:26:34.712]   Amen Amen
[01:26:34.031 --> 01:26:36.472]  So let's read what Professor Thomas Sowell said.
[01:26:36.512 --> 01:26:38.652]  Anybody can look this up, this is not an opinion, it's fact.
[01:26:40.293 --> 01:26:49.675]  More whites were brought as slaves to North Africa than blacks brought as slaves to the United States, or to the 13 colonies from which it was formed.
[01:26:50.295 --> 01:26:58.337]  White slaves were still being bought and sold in the Ottoman Empire decades after blacks were freed in the United States in the 1860s.
[01:26:59.438 --> 01:27:00.258]  Anybody can look that up.
[01:27:01.834 --> 01:27:03.115]  Here's another for the professor.
[01:27:03.815 --> 01:27:07.838]  Blacks were not enslaved because they were black, but because they were available.
[01:27:08.578 --> 01:27:11.280]  Slavery has existed in the world for thousands of years.
[01:27:11.761 --> 01:27:16.964]  Whites enslaved other whites in Europe for centuries before the first black was brought to the Western Hemisphere.
[01:27:17.704 --> 01:27:19.165]  Asians enslaved Europeans.
[01:27:19.826 --> 01:27:21.387]  Asians enslaved other Asians.
[01:27:22.007 --> 01:27:23.768]  Africans enslaved other Africans.
[01:27:24.189 --> 01:27:28.692]  And indeed, even today in North Africa, blacks continue to enslave blacks.
[01:27:29.508 --> 01:27:33.109]  And the Romans at some point had top generals that were black.
[01:27:33.689 --> 01:27:38.111]  They didn't give a damn what color you were as long as you came up through their system.
[01:27:40.492 --> 01:27:44.973]  Now do you hear Germans today complaining about Italians because their ancestors were enslaved?
[01:27:45.954 --> 01:27:55.637]  They're trying to make you have a chip on your shoulder so they can control you and promise you these reparations like free health care or forgiveness of student loans.
[01:27:55.657 --> 01:27:58.238]  You're never going to get it without a bunch of strings of texts.
[01:28:00.134 --> 01:28:01.034]  So here's some headlines.
[01:28:01.574 --> 01:28:06.516]  Inside the Smuggler's Warehouse, Africa's 21st Century Slave Trades.
[01:28:08.417 --> 01:28:09.057]  Irish Times.
[01:28:10.757 --> 01:28:14.819]  Inside the Modern Slave Trade, Trapping African Migrants.
[01:28:15.659 --> 01:28:16.339]  Time Magazine.
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:20.761]  Slave Markets Found on Instagram and Other Apps.
[01:28:22.021 --> 01:28:23.181]  White and Black Slaves.
[01:28:24.582 --> 01:28:26.942]  People for Sale, Where Lives are Auctioned for $400.
[01:28:27.002 --> 01:28:27.123]  CNN.
[01:28:30.242 --> 01:28:32.804]  Migrants from West Africa being sold in Libyan slave markets.
[01:28:33.204 --> 01:28:33.724]  The Guardian.
[01:28:34.224 --> 01:28:43.950]  Okay, so we're not making this up and we're not lessening peoples whose ancestors 180 years ago were slaves, for God's sakes.
[01:28:47.492 --> 01:29:05.932]   The point is, is that it came out 20 years ago that Halliburton was setting up slave camps in Middle Eastern countries For making bricks, for you name it, and was shipping in African and Asian slaves.
[01:29:07.433 --> 01:29:12.635]  So this is so... Here they are burning black slaves.
[01:29:12.655 --> 01:29:14.716]  If you're watching us on TV.
[01:29:17.317 --> 01:29:19.498]  No media coverage, a few blurbs about it.
[01:29:21.149 --> 01:29:22.129]  So this is going on.
[01:29:22.209 --> 01:29:23.850]  What about the illegal aliens they bring in?
[01:29:23.890 --> 01:29:24.590]  They're called migrants.
[01:29:25.011 --> 01:29:34.354]  And they even admit in the New York Times, hundreds of thousands work in tire factories and cereal factories late at night, hardly any food, 18 hours a day.
[01:29:35.254 --> 01:29:37.115]  But they're brown slaves, so it's okay.
[01:29:38.756 --> 01:29:43.678]  No, we should stand up for everybody, because if they can do something bad to them, they can do it to you folks.
[01:29:44.458 --> 01:29:49.160]  It's the giant sucking sound Ross Perot talked about in 1993 in those debates with Al Gore.
[01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:51.626]   He said, listen, Hey listen, Al.
[01:29:52.447 --> 01:29:56.809]  Just five years ago, Canada normalized trade with us.
[01:29:56.849 --> 01:29:59.490]  Their average factory work was paid $35 an hour.
[01:30:00.270 --> 01:30:02.591]  Five years later, they're paid $20 an hour at our level.
[01:30:02.971 --> 01:30:05.172]  We open up to Mexico, they're paid $2 an hour.
[01:30:05.232 --> 01:30:05.712]  We'll drop to $5.
[01:30:06.112 --> 01:30:07.673]  And it happened.
[01:30:09.253 --> 01:30:14.854]   By lowering our standards, we don't raise them up, we lower and crush them.
[01:30:14.854 --> 01:30:22.134]   Feds expand probative migrant child labor and slaughterhouses across the US.
[01:30:22.134 --> 01:30:29.493]   So that's why I talk about this is because people get so upset
[01:30:29.493 --> 01:30:35.814]   if I show some group of racist black people beat some little white kid to death.
[01:30:35.814 --> 01:30:45.814]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:30:37.261 --> 01:30:38.262]  And they go, why are you being racist?
[01:30:38.282 --> 01:30:39.222]  Why are you creating division?
[01:30:39.302 --> 01:30:44.526]  No, I'm calling out the media and the culture saying that's okay as 21.
[01:30:45.066 --> 01:30:48.849]  And I want to have the culture decry that so it's not cool and okay.
[01:30:50.210 --> 01:30:56.995]  And not because 10,000, 20,000 white people being murdered a year by black people.
[01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:00.101]  It's going to end the civilization.
[01:31:01.282 --> 01:31:06.885]  The globalists know that's getting out, and that is meant to create massive division.
[01:31:07.326 --> 01:31:12.049]  I want to ideologically get people to wake up and say no to all of this.
[01:31:12.189 --> 01:31:17.232]  I don't want a race war, but one is being set up on mainstream media.
[01:31:17.272 --> 01:31:26.438]  They keep all the old folks asleep, say everything's fine, nothing's happening, but they then allow it out on the web for people to see what's really going on.
[01:31:27.788 --> 01:31:38.036]  So, Rob Aguero, one of our great producers, brought me an article, and I'm glad he brought me the ZeroHedge.com article because I was familiar with this and saw this a few days ago.
[01:31:38.817 --> 01:31:48.925]  They're going after this Harvard professor who spoke at UT last week, and he found that there is no racial bias in police shootings.
[01:31:50.827 --> 01:31:59.255]   And look, you can argue that, but the truth is, You are twice as likely to be shot by police per capita.
[01:31:59.876 --> 01:32:01.499]  There are more white people than black people in America.
[01:32:02.372 --> 01:32:05.234]  It's not you're twice as likely because there's more white people.
[01:32:05.935 --> 01:32:17.685]  You are twice as likely to be shot as a white person per capita, meaning person to person, for every black, every white, because the police go to your house to the call, they do their job.
[01:32:18.025 --> 01:32:26.151]  They slow roll to the black neighborhoods and don't respond because they're afraid of going to jail if they hurt somebody or shoot somebody.
[01:32:27.513 --> 01:32:35.407]   And so now the black neighborhoods are war zones And most of the victims of the crime are black.
[01:32:36.127 --> 01:32:38.288]  And I don't want to see blacks killing each other.
[01:32:38.648 --> 01:32:40.249]  I don't want to see them being destroyed.
[01:32:41.549 --> 01:32:43.149]  But that's the plan.
[01:32:45.050 --> 01:32:55.313]  If Black Lives Matter can't destroy your nuclear family or can't chop your testicles off, their number one mission is that, in the black nuclear family, cut black men's testicles off.
[01:32:55.333 --> 01:32:56.934]  I mean, it's official.
[01:32:56.954 --> 01:32:57.554]  I think I'm joking.
[01:32:57.574 --> 01:32:58.034]  I'm not joking.
[01:32:59.633 --> 01:33:04.138]  Well, think about how they're scapegoating black people again, just like with gangster rap.
[01:33:04.158 --> 01:33:06.460]  They admit the CIA funded Ice Cube is on record now.
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:08.883]  I already told you this decades ago because I have the sources.
[01:33:10.624 --> 01:33:12.646]  Yeah, we've got a black thug problem.
[01:33:14.328 --> 01:33:15.610]  We've got a white thug problem.
[01:33:15.630 --> 01:33:16.751]  We've got lots of thugs.
[01:33:17.111 --> 01:33:18.733]  We've got an MS-13 thug problem.
[01:33:20.316 --> 01:33:23.838]  But the point is, this is all being done by design.
[01:33:24.518 --> 01:33:26.999]  And the police aren't perfect by any means.
[01:33:27.059 --> 01:33:28.580]  The global is in control of our government.
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:30.061]  The police will be our biggest enemy.
[01:33:31.209 --> 01:33:32.469]  I'm not saying the police are perfect.
[01:33:32.849 --> 01:33:46.033]  I'm simply stating the facts that they get one George Floyd case that looks wrong and they use that to change everything in America and have this huge flip out and the Democrats run on that while they're devaluing all of our currencies.
[01:33:46.513 --> 01:33:48.234]  They're flooding our borders against all of us.
[01:33:48.494 --> 01:33:52.035]  They're fentanyls killing black, white, old, young, Hispanic, gay, straight.
[01:33:53.274 --> 01:33:56.576]  The New World Order gave everybody poison shots.
[01:33:57.336 --> 01:33:59.257]  The New World Order didn't care what color you are.
[01:33:59.778 --> 01:34:07.142]  So they want us all fighting with each other, with balkanization, divide and conquer, while they do this.
[01:34:08.982 --> 01:34:10.503]  And I want to stop it.
[01:34:10.863 --> 01:34:17.866]  But Rob, you brought up this Harvard professor who says all hell broke loose when a study revealed no racial bias in police shootings.
[01:34:18.646 --> 01:34:19.826]  This is a Zero Hedge article.
[01:34:20.547 --> 01:34:23.648]  Ben Weiss of the Free Press sat down with a Harvard economics professor.
[01:34:25.135 --> 01:34:31.858]  Roland Fryer, the University of Texas at Austin last week, discussed what it means to pursue the truth.
[01:34:32.499 --> 01:34:38.922]  Fryer, a highly respected economist, told Weiss about the intense blowback he was dealt.
[01:34:39.827 --> 01:34:45.849]  To him, after he published a study in 2016 showing there was no racial differences in officer-involved shootings.
[01:34:46.230 --> 01:34:50.531]  But that was before the police defunding and George Floyd.
[01:34:51.091 --> 01:34:54.333]  Now, it's 2 to 1 whites getting killed by cops.
[01:34:54.753 --> 01:34:56.333]  And most of the time, they deserve it, folks.
[01:34:56.394 --> 01:34:57.274]  Cops aren't perfect, but...
[01:34:57.774 --> 01:35:04.696]  You know, there's a home dispute, domestic thing, guy runs out with a gun, cops shoot him, that's almost... Most of it is domestic disturbances.
[01:35:04.976 --> 01:35:05.876]  People are emotional.
[01:35:06.156 --> 01:35:08.617]  Cops will tell you they hate going to domestic disputes.
[01:35:09.077 --> 01:35:09.977]  Those are the most dangerous.
[01:35:11.037 --> 01:35:11.717]  I don't want their job.
[01:35:12.758 --> 01:35:15.818]  Hell, I mean... They keep saying it's all these white cops.
[01:35:16.138 --> 01:35:18.559]  Most of the cities, half the people or more aren't even white.
[01:35:19.926 --> 01:35:28.594]  The study found the police were over two times more likely to use physical force such as manhandling or beating against black or Hispanic individuals compared to people from other races.
[01:35:29.154 --> 01:35:40.785]  On the other hand, the findings also revealed the police were 23.8 times less included to use firearms against black individuals and 8.5 times less inclined to do so against Hispanic individuals.
[01:35:42.401 --> 01:35:46.002]  They'll use their hands on black people, but they won't pull their guns.
[01:35:46.242 --> 01:35:47.903]  And this is 2016 data.
[01:35:48.363 --> 01:35:49.144]  The new data's out.
[01:35:49.704 --> 01:35:51.925]  Twice as likely of your wife to be shot by the cops.
[01:35:52.545 --> 01:35:56.626]  And you saw this crazy cop in Florida run up and just shoot a suspect in handcuffs.
[01:35:56.946 --> 01:35:58.547]  They're hiring a lot of kooks, folks.
[01:35:59.167 --> 01:36:00.228]  The police aren't perfect.
[01:36:00.268 --> 01:36:01.168]  Don't get me wrong.
[01:36:02.128 --> 01:36:06.850]  Rob Aguero, I want to get your take on this situation and overall what I've been covering here.
[01:36:08.031 --> 01:36:08.511]  Yes, sir.
[01:36:08.551 --> 01:36:09.531]  You said it perfectly.
[01:36:09.850 --> 01:36:12.970]  It's a divide and conquer technique.
[01:36:12.970 --> 01:36:17.210]   And if you think about what they've been doing since the 1960s, all they've been doing
[01:36:17.210 --> 01:36:19.289]  is continue to segregate everybody.
[01:36:19.289 --> 01:36:22.529]   Even though we are all one human race, no matter your color.
[01:36:22.529 --> 01:36:26.650]   No one cares what color eye you have or how tall you really are.
[01:36:26.650 --> 01:36:30.529]   All these things are very, very minuscule in the actual spiritual world that we're in.
[01:36:30.529 --> 01:36:36.090]   So when you bring that all the way back to current times, and any Democrat city you go to,
[01:36:36.090 --> 01:36:37.250]  it's still segregated.
[01:36:37.178 --> 01:36:42.563]  You can go to the east side where the black people are, you can go to the south side where the Hispanics are, and the whites are on the north side.
[01:36:43.339 --> 01:36:56.209]  So as time has gone by, as those stats show, that the cops and the mind control that has been set on the masses has been hurting everybody to attack the white person.
[01:36:56.609 --> 01:37:10.299]  Those stats even show that this whole white man bad, cops are bad, has made the police be less likely to shoot a black person or a person of color just because of the backlash they're going to get.
[01:37:12.153 --> 01:37:24.117]  This is not a healthy relationship that we have, and it's only going to lead to one race being exterminated, and it's going to be by another race now, so now it's not going to get any backlash like they were the ones who are doing this.
[01:37:25.077 --> 01:37:30.739]  I totally agree, but bottom line, I said this 20 years ago, the globalists are depopulating, they're starting it now.
[01:37:30.779 --> 01:37:32.539]  They've gone from testing to operational.
[01:37:32.979 --> 01:37:34.740]  They want to get white people on board with this.
[01:37:35.916 --> 01:37:37.139]  I mean, that's what's going on.
[01:37:37.159 --> 01:37:42.450]  They want to get white people so attacked, so manipulated, so angry they go along with this.
[01:37:42.530 --> 01:37:44.895]  So I'm literally trying to stop this, Rob.
[01:37:45.791 --> 01:37:51.717]  I agree, and I mean, me being on the other end of a color spectrum of viewers, we have the same shared experience with that.
[01:37:52.118 --> 01:38:02.808]  No one wants to see anybody die because of the color of their skin, and no one wants to see these unelected bureaucrats making all these decisions who are forcing and pushing these agendas on the younger people.
[01:38:02.949 --> 01:38:03.449]  Exactly!
[01:38:03.569 --> 01:38:05.731]  I'm sick of them pulling the strings, people!
[01:38:05.992 --> 01:38:06.772]  They're the enemy!
[01:38:06.792 --> 01:38:07.854]  They're the enemy!
[01:38:09.375 --> 01:38:14.077]  And they're unelected and we can't do anything about it other than get up here and rant till we're blue in the face.
[01:38:14.777 --> 01:38:16.838]  And the only way they can win is us killing each other.
[01:38:17.178 --> 01:38:17.619]  Exactly.
[01:38:17.639 --> 01:38:23.681]  And that's what they're, if they can't get us with the vaccines, with GMOs, with fluoride in the water, they're going to pin us against each other.
[01:38:24.061 --> 01:38:32.525]  And then we're going to have this fake race war that we've been fighting since 2020, since 2016, honestly, in the mainstream, just because of black versus white.
[01:38:32.745 --> 01:38:40.994]  Well the good news is there's black professors, I don't care what color he is, this guy had to have a lot of courage because you know they go after his funding, they're trying to get him fired.
[01:38:41.694 --> 01:38:43.256]  He's just stating the facts here.
[01:38:44.998 --> 01:38:46.680]  Absolutely, and that's what's gonna...
[01:38:47.498 --> 01:38:50.700]  Give them the biggest wake-up call is the facts.
[01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:56.023]  If we kill them with facts, politically, then they have no ground to stand on.
[01:38:56.103 --> 01:38:57.284]  And Rob, that's the good news.
[01:38:57.324 --> 01:39:00.846]  We've got upwards of 40% of blacks saying they're going to vote Trump.
[01:39:01.347 --> 01:39:02.748]  Upwards of 50% of Hispanics.
[01:39:03.108 --> 01:39:05.229]  The good news is, and the Democrats are panicking.
[01:39:05.269 --> 01:39:07.350]  They admitted this in the news in the Houston Chronicle last week.
[01:39:07.711 --> 01:39:08.491]  They're panicking.
[01:39:08.531 --> 01:39:10.272]  They thought blacks and Hispanics were dumb.
[01:39:10.532 --> 01:39:10.893]  Guess what?
[01:39:10.933 --> 01:39:11.313]  They're not.
[01:39:12.458 --> 01:39:13.418]  No, no, they're not at all.
[01:39:13.458 --> 01:39:21.882]  And I think at the end of the day, this whole migration replacement is going to end up biting them in the ass because these people aren't going to want to live in the same place that they left.
[01:39:22.302 --> 01:39:29.545]  They're not going to want to go through the same communism, socialism, be having to go be like Venezuela and go to the trash for their food.
[01:39:29.565 --> 01:39:32.766]  No one's going to want that, especially after they get a taste of the American culture.
[01:39:34.107 --> 01:39:36.208]  That's why they got into America, not that it's perfect.
[01:39:36.248 --> 01:39:37.808]  It's the best house in a bad neighborhood.
[01:39:38.208 --> 01:39:39.589]  Rob, any other key points you want to add?
[01:39:40.498 --> 01:39:46.903]  No, this is the fact that, I mean, everybody here at InfoWars and all we want is the best for everybody and there's no, there's not a race war.
[01:39:46.963 --> 01:39:49.104]  It's just something that they perceive for us to believe.
[01:39:49.825 --> 01:39:51.026]  Well, I'm a human supremacist.
[01:39:51.186 --> 01:39:54.348]  I want us to dominate the robots, the AI, all of it.
[01:39:54.368 --> 01:39:55.289]  I'm a pro-human guy.
[01:39:55.709 --> 01:39:56.270]  Absolutely.
[01:39:56.350 --> 01:39:56.790]  Same here.
[01:39:57.471 --> 01:39:58.031]  Love you, Rob.
[01:39:58.071 --> 01:39:58.371]  Thank you.
[01:39:58.391 --> 01:39:58.972]  Love you too, boss.
[01:39:59.670 --> 01:40:00.671]  Alright, we're out of time.
[01:40:00.731 --> 01:40:03.874]  The great Owen Troyer takes over in like five minutes.
[01:40:03.914 --> 01:40:07.857]  But I wanted to hit this because my phone blew up for three days.
[01:40:08.258 --> 01:40:09.819]  I got so many emails, calls.
[01:40:10.300 --> 01:40:11.321]  Oh my God, you're right!
[01:40:11.721 --> 01:40:15.805]  Cheerios and Quaker Oats sterilizes you and makes, turns boys into girls.
[01:40:16.265 --> 01:40:17.466]  It's all right here, folks.
[01:40:19.608 --> 01:40:21.550]  It's another one of these herbicides.
[01:40:23.411 --> 01:40:24.913]  And they've got herbicides that don't do this.
[01:40:26.288 --> 01:40:29.370]  But they've chosen herbicides to do this on purpose.
[01:40:30.011 --> 01:40:30.611]  By design.
[01:40:30.631 --> 01:40:40.438]  80% of Americans test positive for chemical found in Cheerios, Quaker Oats that may cause infertility, delayed puberty study, and bend your gender.
[01:40:42.259 --> 01:40:42.379]  Oh!
[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:47.723]  Black people and white people and Hispanics and Asians are all eating Cheerios.
[01:40:48.223 --> 01:40:50.305]  Dammit, I got Cheerios in my cabinet.
[01:40:51.686 --> 01:40:57.971]   And they put a chemical in it That literally shrivels your dick.
[01:40:59.812 --> 01:41:01.454]  And makes women go into puberty earlier.
[01:41:02.234 --> 01:41:05.717]  So your seven-year-old is already having... I mean, this is sick, folks.
[01:41:07.118 --> 01:41:08.179]  This is so sick.
[01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:11.982]  And I'm gonna be covering this in great detail tomorrow.
[01:41:14.304 --> 01:41:15.065]  Chloroquine.
[01:41:15.866 --> 01:41:18.668]  What you need to know about this problematic pesticide.
[01:41:20.868 --> 01:41:23.911]  You know, almost all of you out there are not gluten intolerant.
[01:41:24.451 --> 01:41:37.363]  In the late 90s, they started allowing, the FDA did, and the EPA, adding glyphosate, spraying wheat when it came into season.
[01:41:39.004 --> 01:41:42.988]  A week or two before harvesting, fungus tends to eat the wheat.
[01:41:44.093 --> 01:41:49.618]  So they said, well, now it's not just on soybeans or corn when they're planting the corn to kill any weeds around it.
[01:41:50.198 --> 01:41:51.359]  It just goes to the water table.
[01:41:51.379 --> 01:41:52.700]  We drink it in the water and it kills us.
[01:41:53.901 --> 01:41:58.265]  No, now we're going to spray it right on the food, right before it's harvested.
[01:42:00.626 --> 01:42:01.487]  And then you eat it.
[01:42:04.550 --> 01:42:06.952]  And then it causes cancer, all these health problems.
[01:42:07.992 --> 01:42:10.895]  Well, it's the same thing with this chemical.
[01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:15.021]  And they know exactly what they're doing with it.
[01:42:15.902 --> 01:42:17.482]  So I'm going to cover this big time.
[01:42:18.163 --> 01:42:20.524]  But here's the molecular makeup of chloroquine.
[01:42:21.725 --> 01:42:23.085]  They spray this on the food.
[01:42:23.846 --> 01:42:24.826]  It stunts the growth.
[01:42:24.846 --> 01:42:31.249]  It ages the oats and other plants that they do it to.
[01:42:32.170 --> 01:42:34.831]  And then it's full of it when you eat it.
[01:42:35.851 --> 01:42:38.933]  Hey, if something stunts a plant's growth, it makes it age faster.
[01:42:40.609 --> 01:42:45.731]  But it makes it create more of what you eat from the plant.
[01:42:46.631 --> 01:42:47.711]  What do you think that does?
[01:42:47.771 --> 01:42:50.412]  They know all this and they're laughing at us.
[01:42:50.792 --> 01:42:56.534]  What does black have to do, or white, with them putting this in our damn Cheerios?
[01:42:59.275 --> 01:43:02.296]  Stop it!
[01:43:02.336 --> 01:43:03.676]  5G hurts everybody!
[01:43:04.917 --> 01:43:06.657]  GMO hurts everybody!
[01:43:07.017 --> 01:43:08.758]  Chloroquine hurts everybody!
[01:43:10.660 --> 01:43:12.482]  Glyphosate hurts everybody!
[01:43:12.762 --> 01:43:14.783]  Devalued currency hurts everybody!
[01:43:16.245 --> 01:43:33.159]  But at the same time, we gotta stand up against all this anti-white crap, and people gotta learn, because if you won't stand up against that, you won't stand up against nothing, and say, leave me alone, you're being manipulated by George Soros and the ADL, and leave me alone, or join me right now to save humanity.
[01:43:36.055 --> 01:43:40.418]  Now listen, we're under major globalist attack with your support, plus we have incredible products.

[01:44:22.963 --> 01:44:23.904]  Great job to the crew.

[01:44:42.556 --> 01:44:44.556]  I'll see you at Relox Jones on X.
[01:44:44.556 --> 01:44:48.556]  [Music]
[01:44:49.556 --> 01:44:55.556]  [Music]
[01:44:55.556 --> 01:44:57.556]  Victor in Florida.
[01:44:56.925 --> 01:44:57.626]  Thank you for holding.
[01:44:57.666 --> 01:44:57.987]  Go ahead.
[01:44:58.207 --> 01:45:06.485]  I have to say it really pisses me off to hear when you say that only 2% of the people that listen to this broadcast buy products.
[01:45:07.328 --> 01:45:08.329]  Um, I'm a young man.
[01:45:08.349 --> 01:45:09.549]  I don't make that much money.
[01:45:09.889 --> 01:45:10.650]  I just bought a house.
[01:45:10.750 --> 01:45:11.530]  I just got married.
[01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:13.311]  I buy the products as much as I can.
[01:45:13.411 --> 01:45:14.612]  I buy them almost every month.
[01:45:14.852 --> 01:45:17.514]  I've bought the iodine, the beets, the methylfolate.
[01:45:17.554 --> 01:45:18.254]  I've just tried it.
[01:45:18.394 --> 01:45:21.055]  It's absurd to me that you people are listening to this guy.
[01:45:21.075 --> 01:45:22.336]  I've listened to you for 10 years.
[01:45:22.616 --> 01:45:25.238]  He puts this show out here for free, and you're not supporting him.
[01:45:25.338 --> 01:45:29.160]  Our country is falling apart, but you've got millions of people listening to you not doing sh**.
[01:45:30.561 --> 01:45:32.282]  Well, look, look, there's a glut of media.
[01:45:32.302 --> 01:45:33.243]  There's so much media.
[01:45:33.303 --> 01:45:34.003]  I'm not blaming the 99%.
[01:45:34.124 --> 01:45:37.126]  It's the 99% that never buy anything.
[01:45:37.626 --> 01:45:39.187]  It's just these are really good products.
[01:45:39.207 --> 01:45:43.811]  And if we just had 1% more by the products, it would change the whole world.
[01:45:43.891 --> 01:45:45.732]  So these are really great products to begin with.
[01:45:46.293 --> 01:45:47.894]  We have the best turmeric out there, 95% humanoid.
[01:45:49.275 --> 01:45:50.816]  Incredible anti-inflammation.
[01:45:50.976 --> 01:45:52.077]  So good for your whole body.
[01:45:52.177 --> 01:45:54.359]  We have all the other great products at InfoWarshaw.com.
[01:45:54.419 --> 01:46:00.004]  We have next-level foundational energy with the methylfolate and the B-Complex supercharges cellular energy.
[01:46:00.064 --> 01:46:02.166]  So it's not a stimulant, but it feels like a stimulant.
[01:46:02.226 --> 01:46:05.208]  Let me ask you, what happened when you took next-level foundational energy?
[01:46:06.309 --> 01:46:12.758]  I've been taking it for, I don't know, a couple weeks now and in my younger days I've experimented with stimulants and those things.
[01:46:12.938 --> 01:46:14.100]  It feels nothing like that.
[01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:15.602]  You feel like you're supposed to feel it.
[01:46:15.622 --> 01:46:18.505]  You're supposed to have energy, you know, and that's pretty much it.
[01:46:18.606 --> 01:46:19.847]  It doesn't feel like a stimulant.
[01:46:19.867 --> 01:46:21.129]  You just feel like you're supposed to be.
[01:46:21.269 --> 01:46:30.757]  And what it does is it's the breakdown of folic acid that almost everybody, but particularly some people, northern Europeans, have a low breakdown of.
[01:46:31.157 --> 01:46:36.061]  So you just give yourselves the direct food that they operate off of and they clean out with.
[01:46:36.501 --> 01:46:38.643]  That's why next level financial energy is so important.
[01:46:38.923 --> 01:46:40.525]  Thank you for the call, Victor, and thanks for the plug.
